00:04.883 --> 00:08.010
Master Carlton, I have to take this tray
up to your mother...

00:08.086 --> 00:11.180
so on your way out
would you mind taking out the garbage?

00:11.256 --> 00:13.019
Do I look like Roc?

00:14.860 --> 00:17.351
I don't know, Carlton,
maybe if you shaved your head bald...

00:17.429 --> 00:19.454
and sanded down the square part.

00:22.134 --> 00:23.931
Ashley, you take out the garbage.

00:24.002 --> 00:25.993
- Why me?
- Because I'm bigger than you.

00:26.071 --> 00:30.030
See, that's not fair. That's only
'cause you got them shoe lifts in today.

00:31.310 --> 00:35.110
They're not lifts.
I doubled up on my Odor-<i>E</i> aters.

00:37.616 --> 00:40.449
- Here, Hilary, you take it out.
- Out where?

00:40.519 --> 00:41.781
To the trash cans.

00:41.853 --> 00:45.254
Y ou know, those things you hit
every time you back out the car.

00:45.324 --> 00:48.054
Thank God.
I thought it was the neighbor's kids.

00:49.595 --> 00:53.053
This is gross.
I don't touch greasy, disgusting things.

00:53.699 --> 00:56.668
Well, just pretend
it's buying you dinner afterwards.

01:00.606 --> 01:02.267
- Y ou take it.
- Y o, girl!

01:02.341 --> 01:04.900
And for your information,
dinner comes first.

01:06.745 --> 01:09.509
Oh, it's like that, right?
Y ou're just gonna slam garbage at me.

01:09.581 --> 01:11.071
Good morning, Will.

01:11.149 --> 01:12.844
Good morning, Uncle Phil.
Here's your lunch.

01:12.918 --> 01:14.215
Thank you.

02:29.361 --> 02:31.761
Good morning, Geoffrey.
Isn't it a glorious day?

02:31.830 --> 02:34.822
Actually, sir,
I have an impacted wisdom tooth...

02:34.900 --> 02:39.462
my hair is falling out,
and I have a bunion the size of my fist.

02:40.472 --> 02:43.134
Oh, no. We're out of Mrs. Butterworth's.

02:43.208 --> 02:45.199
Thanks for the talk, big guy.

02:46.712 --> 02:48.577
- Good morning, Uncle Phil.
- Good morning, Will.

02:48.647 --> 02:50.478
- What up, G? This mine?
- Morning, Master William.

02:50.549 --> 02:52.744
- Y es.
- Thank you. Oh, man.

02:55.954 --> 02:58.388
Hey, Will, why don't you sit down and eat?

02:58.457 --> 03:01.790
Sorry but, Uncle Phil,
I ain't got no time. Oh, man.

03:01.860 --> 03:05.455
Hey, look, any chance of you letting me
balance this book on your head?

03:06.431 --> 03:08.524
Hey, you know
I was gonna put the waffles up there...

03:08.600 --> 03:11.569
but that's just a little too close
to your mouth, you know what I mean?

03:15.240 --> 03:17.868
Will, sit down.
Y ou're giving me motion sickness.

03:17.976 --> 03:22.140
Sorry about that, Uncle Phil.
Man, it's like there's so much to do.

03:22.247 --> 03:25.273
I mean, between my school work
and Cindy...

03:25.417 --> 03:28.477
and, you know, my job and Cindy...

03:29.654 --> 03:32.282
and, you know, basketball and Cindy...

03:34.025 --> 03:36.220
Wow, you think I'm neglecting Cindy?

03:36.661 --> 03:38.822
Maybe you should take
a little time off from work.

03:38.897 --> 03:40.592
Y ou're gonna wear yourself out.

03:40.665 --> 03:42.223
Thank you, sir.

03:43.935 --> 03:47.371
It's nice to know
that all my labors haven't gone unnoticed.

03:47.439 --> 03:49.134
I was talking to Will.

03:49.207 --> 03:51.801
And I, apparently, was talking to myself.

03:55.046 --> 03:56.445
Will, how about it?

03:56.515 --> 03:58.983
Y ou sure there's nobody
who can cover for you at the restaurant?

03:59.084 --> 04:00.108
No, I wish there was, Uncle Phil.

04:00.218 --> 04:01.981
I've got to make some extra money
for the prom.

04:02.053 --> 04:03.918
I mean, 'cause I wouldn't feel
like a gentleman...

04:03.989 --> 04:06.253
if I made Cindy pay for my half, too.

04:07.793 --> 04:10.819
- Look at my face!
- Please, man, we eating.

04:10.896 --> 04:12.022
Will.

04:12.998 --> 04:14.226
This is serious.

04:14.299 --> 04:16.459
The prom's only three days away,
and I got a pimple.

04:16.535 --> 04:18.230
Carlton, we're eating.

04:19.070 --> 04:23.166
I need some vitamin <i>E</i>.
I should have seen it coming. It never fails.

04:23.241 --> 04:25.709
<i>E</i> very time I have a big date
I get a big pimple.

04:25.777 --> 04:30.111
Well, judging by the size of that thing,
you must be going out with Nell Carter.

04:37.756 --> 04:39.018
Hi, Will.

04:40.892 --> 04:43.087
Cindy. Cindy. Cindy.

04:43.595 --> 04:47.156
Girl, anybody ever told you
that you got the...

04:49.034 --> 04:52.003
Thanks, I'll try not to let it go to my head.

04:52.070 --> 04:55.870
Look, sorry, baby. All this running around
is kind of catching up to me.

04:56.208 --> 04:58.904
Well, you make sure
you save some energy for the prom.

04:58.977 --> 05:01.878
Don't you even worry about me, girl.
I'm gonna be all right.

05:01.947 --> 05:04.381
I'm planning on staying up all night,
you know...

05:04.449 --> 05:07.384
'cause "all I want to do
is zoom-a-zoom-zoom-zoom."

05:13.124 --> 05:14.216
What up, J?

05:14.292 --> 05:16.726
Hey, Will. Y ou wanna carpool
to work again after practice?

05:16.795 --> 05:17.853
Y eah, that's cool, man.

05:17.929 --> 05:20.261
Y ou know, we're counting on you
for the big game this weekend.

05:20.332 --> 05:22.596
Hey, man, don't you even worry about me.
I'm gonna be there.

05:22.667 --> 05:26.797
"Smith dribbles. He stops. He pops.
He scores. The crowd goes wild!"

05:31.543 --> 05:34.239
- Man, I'm beat.
- Y ou could do what I do.

05:34.613 --> 05:36.080
No, that's all right. I don't think...

05:36.147 --> 05:38.911
listening to Bruce Springsteen
got the same effect on black people.

05:44.623 --> 05:48.457
My breath ain't stinking,
so I'm guessing them ain't Tic Tacs.

05:48.593 --> 05:52.188
These will help you stay awake.
Y ou've done speed before, right?

05:52.297 --> 05:54.993
No, I didn't, and I didn't think
you was living like that, either.

05:55.066 --> 05:57.398
I'm into whatever gets the job done.

05:57.469 --> 06:01.769
To me, it's just freeze-dried coffee,
just in case.

06:05.477 --> 06:06.910
Just in case.

06:07.679 --> 06:08.976
Hey, guys.

06:11.816 --> 06:13.249
Later, Will.

06:15.053 --> 06:16.645
Big date this weekend?

06:24.396 --> 06:28.457
I just want to thank
Bill and Hillary Clinton...

06:29.935 --> 06:32.460
for inviting me to the inauguration.

06:33.405 --> 06:36.306
- Will, wake up.
- Y o, man, go away.

06:36.841 --> 06:39.435
Will, this is the senior prom...

06:39.511 --> 06:42.207
also known as "guaranteed action night."

06:43.348 --> 06:44.781
Rack 'em up.

06:46.551 --> 06:48.951
Here you are, Master William,
maybe this'll help.

06:49.020 --> 06:53.389
It's an old remedy passed down in
my family from generation to generation.

06:55.393 --> 06:59.159
- G, it's coffee.
- No, it's Folgers Crystals.

07:04.035 --> 07:06.526
Will, pardon my tough love...

07:06.604 --> 07:10.165
but this burning the candle at both ends
is dumb, dumb, dumb.

07:11.076 --> 07:13.670
I know, Carlton. I just wish
there was something else I could do.

07:13.745 --> 07:16.771
It's like there ain't enough hours
in the day.

07:22.020 --> 07:25.353
Carlton, did you ever think about taking...

07:25.957 --> 07:28.084
you know, drugs?

07:29.160 --> 07:30.821
Will, you don't have to
beat around the bush.

07:30.895 --> 07:33.056
- I know exactly what you're getting at.
- Y ou do?

07:33.131 --> 07:36.191
Y ou see the volcano-sized pimple
about to erupt on my forehead...

07:36.267 --> 07:38.963
and you don't think vitamin <i>E</i>
is strong enough.

07:40.271 --> 07:42.637
No, man. I mean, well, yeah, but...

07:45.110 --> 07:47.840
I mean, the kind of drugs
that help you stay up.

07:48.446 --> 07:51.745
Up? Y ou don't mean...

07:56.988 --> 08:00.116
This sex thing is even more complicated
than I thought.

08:06.631 --> 08:08.622
Y ou know what? Never mind, man.

08:11.736 --> 08:15.331
Y ou know, Will,
if it turns out tonight is the big night...

08:15.573 --> 08:19.634
I'm just glad I'll be sharing it with
someone who cares about me so deeply.

08:20.211 --> 08:23.044
Y o, man, I'm just sharing a limo with you.

08:23.114 --> 08:26.572
I'm talking about my date.
She worships the ground I walk on.

08:26.651 --> 08:29.211
No, man, she's just looking
for loose change.

08:30.055 --> 08:32.182
Miss Cindy and Miss Vanessa.

08:33.258 --> 08:34.246
Wow.

08:34.525 --> 08:37.722
- Y ou look great.
- Thank you, Carlton, so do you.

08:41.265 --> 08:45.327
Somebody call a cop, 'cause
it got to be illegal to look that good.

08:45.437 --> 08:46.426
Oh, Will.

08:47.705 --> 08:49.434
Y ou look pretty terrific yourself.

08:49.507 --> 08:51.975
Girl, don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful.

08:53.078 --> 08:55.171
Y ou kids look great.
Come on, let me get a picture.

08:55.246 --> 08:57.806
- Mom!
- I know I'm treating you like a baby.

08:57.882 --> 09:01.682
No, shoot me from the other side.
I've got a situation on my forehead.

09:03.088 --> 09:06.023
Okay, smile.

09:07.492 --> 09:10.620
Now, I know this is prom night,
but I still think we should set a curfew.

09:10.695 --> 09:12.686
Come on, Uncle Phil,
don't you even worry about it.

09:12.764 --> 09:14.755
Come on, we'll be home early.

09:15.767 --> 09:17.632
<i>E</i> arly tomorrow morning.

09:19.571 --> 09:21.903
Hey, stop. Come on, one more picture.

09:21.973 --> 09:25.807
Hey, yo, I'm telling you, this is gonna be
the most exciting night of our lives.

09:30.115 --> 09:31.104
Will.

09:33.852 --> 09:34.841
Will.

09:37.155 --> 09:38.679
Will, wake up.

09:38.756 --> 09:41.657
Vanessa keeps staring at my pimples.
What should I do?

09:41.726 --> 09:43.250
Stare at hers.

09:43.528 --> 09:47.259
Come on, Will, you gotta help me.
This could be the biggest night of my life.

09:47.332 --> 09:50.324
Y eah, to go along
with the biggest zit of your life.

09:51.002 --> 09:53.835
The least you can do
is give me some vitamin <i>E</i>.

09:54.038 --> 09:56.871
Carlton, vitamin <i>E</i>
is not going to help, man.

09:56.941 --> 09:59.432
A sandblaster is not going to help, man.

09:59.911 --> 10:02.436
Come on, Will, don't hold out on me.
Y ou have any or not?

10:02.514 --> 10:05.108
Look, I don't know.
Look, check my locker, man.

10:05.483 --> 10:07.280
Look, and if there ain't nothing in there...

10:07.352 --> 10:10.810
you can just pull your big ol' bottom lip
up over your head.

10:15.226 --> 10:16.215
Will.

10:16.794 --> 10:17.783
Will.

10:17.962 --> 10:19.429
Hey, girl, what's up?

10:19.497 --> 10:22.989
Y ou've been sleeping all night.
When are you gonna ask me to dance?

10:23.067 --> 10:24.432
No, baby, we gonna get down.

10:24.502 --> 10:27.369
I'm just waiting for the DJ
to throw on something I like.

10:27.438 --> 10:29.497
How about "I'm going home"?

10:30.074 --> 10:32.872
Now that's the jam.
Tell me when he puts that on.

10:56.467 --> 11:00.597
Go, Carlton. Go, Carlton. Go, Carlton.

11:39.244 --> 11:41.508
Oh, Carlton, you were something else.

11:41.579 --> 11:43.672
Carlton, you were somebody else.
Man, you all right?

11:43.748 --> 11:44.737
I feel great.

11:44.816 --> 11:48.343
<i>E</i> ven though I was feeling insecure before,
I realized it doesn't matter, anyway...

11:48.419 --> 11:50.853
'cause beauty's only skin deep.
It's what's inside that counts.

11:50.922 --> 11:53.049
Vanessa, you drive me wild.
I hope this night never ends.

11:53.124 --> 11:56.924
Is it just me or are my lips moving
really, really fast? Wanna dance? Come on.

12:18.750 --> 12:20.217
Y our cousin's pretty wild.

12:20.285 --> 12:23.482
I guess he's got that kind of
natural speed thing going.

12:23.554 --> 12:25.249
Y eah, you can say that again.

12:25.323 --> 12:29.657
Want me to hook you up with some more
of those pills? I'll get you a good price.

12:37.201 --> 12:39.294
Oh, my God. Hey, Carlton. Carlton.

12:41.372 --> 12:43.363
Carlton, listen.
Something terrible has happened, man.

12:43.441 --> 12:45.238
- Come on, I gotta get you to the hospital.
- Why?

12:45.310 --> 12:48.040
- This is the greatest night of my...
- Carlton.

12:48.880 --> 12:49.869
Carlton.

12:49.947 --> 12:51.574
Y o, Carlton, man.

13:07.965 --> 13:11.492
God, if you let Carlton be okay...

13:11.569 --> 13:14.037
I swear I'll never make fun of him again.

13:16.140 --> 13:20.008
I'll go to Church every Sunday.
I'll even give up women.

13:21.713 --> 13:23.305
Will, was that you?

13:24.716 --> 13:28.277
Y ou know I was just kidding
about that woman part, right?

13:30.855 --> 13:32.550
Where am I?

13:32.623 --> 13:34.921
Last thing I remember,
I was doing the running man...

13:34.992 --> 13:36.983
to <i>/ Wi// A/ways Love You.</i>

13:38.963 --> 13:41.090
Carlton, you're at a hospital.

13:41.265 --> 13:42.789
I feel terrible.

13:43.735 --> 13:46.966
I never thought losing my virginity
would be this painful.

13:52.910 --> 13:55.071
Carlton, I got some bad news.

13:55.413 --> 13:57.779
- Oh, God, I malfunctioned.
- No.

14:01.119 --> 14:04.520
See, you never made it
past the dance floor.

14:07.158 --> 14:09.752
Those pills that you took weren't vitamins.

14:09.994 --> 14:11.427
What were they?

14:12.096 --> 14:14.496
Look, you gotta promise
you're not gonna overreact.

14:14.565 --> 14:17.693
What could be worse
than finding out I'm still a virgin?

14:21.172 --> 14:22.639
It was speed.

14:22.840 --> 14:25.832
Oh, my God.
I'm a drug addict and a virgin!

14:28.679 --> 14:31.409
Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.

14:31.682 --> 14:32.944
Now be quiet.

14:34.185 --> 14:35.379
Comfy?

14:36.521 --> 14:40.048
Well, Mr. Banks, you gave us quite a scare.

14:40.124 --> 14:43.321
- How you feeling now?
- Terrible. I wanna go home.

14:43.394 --> 14:44.884
Y our parents are on the way...

14:44.962 --> 14:48.796
but we will have to keep you here in
the Chemical Dependency Unit overnight.

14:48.866 --> 14:50.197
<i>E</i> xcuse me?

14:50.735 --> 14:55.035
I'm sorry, but that's standard procedure
with all our substance-abuse patients.

14:56.674 --> 15:00.508
<i>E</i> xcuse me, Miss Irene,
that's such a pretty name. Listen...

15:01.946 --> 15:03.538
I don't think you understand.

15:03.614 --> 15:07.607
See, Carlton is not addicted to drugs.
I mean, Carlton hates drugs.

15:07.685 --> 15:10.654
We still have to mix his aspirin
in with applesauce.

15:11.222 --> 15:12.553
Well, that may be...

15:12.623 --> 15:15.592
but that certainly wasn't applesauce
we pumped out of his stomach.

15:15.660 --> 15:18.128
Can't we at least move me
to another part of the hospital?

15:18.196 --> 15:22.326
I've got a reputation to worry about.
What if I want to run for a political office?

15:22.400 --> 15:24.163
Well, now, I'll tell you the same thing...

15:24.235 --> 15:26.260
I told the last person
that asked me that question:

15:26.337 --> 15:28.430
Just say you didn't inhale.

15:33.878 --> 15:37.211
Listen, somehow
we're missing each other.

15:37.281 --> 15:39.977
I mean, does he look like a drug addict?

15:40.985 --> 15:43.954
- Do I?
- Can we stick to the subject, please?

15:45.990 --> 15:48.686
Listen, sweetie,
the first time I came into this hospital...

15:48.759 --> 15:50.420
it was on a stretcher.

15:50.495 --> 15:55.023
Hell, I've been from y ale to jail,
and from Park Avenue to park bench...

15:55.099 --> 15:58.125
but now I'm clean and sober.

15:58.970 --> 16:00.904
That's really touching...

16:01.472 --> 16:04.669
but do you think you can get me
a nurse without a record?

16:08.412 --> 16:11.677
I like him.
Try and help him to stick around.

16:14.485 --> 16:17.921
- Honey, are you okay?
- I think so.

16:17.989 --> 16:19.320
Oh, thank God.

16:19.690 --> 16:20.850
Now, what the hell are you doing...

16:20.925 --> 16:23.120
with 2,000 milligrams of amphetamines
in your stomach?

16:23.194 --> 16:27.358
It was an accident. I thought they were
vitamin <i>E</i> tablets. I got them from...

16:29.400 --> 16:32.198
one of the other kids' lockers at school.

16:32.904 --> 16:35.634
Carlton, you cannot take unidentified pills.

16:35.706 --> 16:37.196
It's just plain stupid.

16:37.275 --> 16:40.472
- Lf Will hadn't gotten you to the hospital...
- Hey, look, Uncle Phil...

16:40.545 --> 16:43.639
I'm gonna go let Ashley and Hilary
and Geoffrey know that he's all right.

16:43.714 --> 16:45.944
No, Will, I just want to thank you.

16:46.017 --> 16:48.542
Y ou showed quick thinking
and sound judgment.

16:48.619 --> 16:51.611
- Carlton, you could learn from Will.
- Uncle Phil, please.

16:51.689 --> 16:56.592
No, now it's not often that I get a chance
to compliment you.

16:57.028 --> 16:59.519
As a matter of fact,
I think this is the one and only time.

16:59.597 --> 17:03.363
Anyway, look, I just want you to know
how grateful your aunt and I are.

17:03.434 --> 17:04.867
Y ou know, if it weren't for you, Will...

17:04.935 --> 17:07.063
I don't know
where Carlton would be right now.

17:07.137 --> 17:10.335
Carlton, honey,
don't you have something to say to Will?

17:12.143 --> 17:13.440
Like what?

17:13.877 --> 17:18.838
Like, "I'm sorry for ruining your prom,"
and, "thank you for saving my life"?

17:21.819 --> 17:25.255
No, that's all right. No, really. Bye.

17:28.726 --> 17:31.991
I'm sorry, folks, but this patient of ours
has to get his rest.

17:32.063 --> 17:34.964
We're not gonna leave our baby alone.
We're gonna be spending the night.

17:35.032 --> 17:37.626
We are? I mean, we are, yes.

17:38.336 --> 17:40.896
Could you get us some clean linen
for that bed?

17:40.972 --> 17:43.099
Honey, I don't think we can both fit
in that bed.

17:43.174 --> 17:45.472
Right, and a chair for my wife.

17:55.453 --> 17:57.978
- Oh, I'm so glad you're okay.
- Me, too.

17:58.055 --> 18:01.422
- Welcome home, Master Carlton.
- Thanks, I feel a lot better.

18:01.492 --> 18:04.791
Y eah, thanks to Will.
He really saved the day.

18:04.862 --> 18:06.557
Well, I'm gonna go take a nap.

18:06.631 --> 18:09.429
I didn't get much sleep last night
with all that kicking.

18:09.500 --> 18:11.161
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

18:15.306 --> 18:18.173
Hey, look.
Y'all mind if I talk to Carlton for a second?

18:20.411 --> 18:23.073
Carlton, I'm sorry
you had such a rough night.

18:23.147 --> 18:25.581
Hey, but at least your face cleared up.

18:26.984 --> 18:28.212
Almost.

18:36.193 --> 18:38.491
Thanks a lot for covering for me, man.

18:39.263 --> 18:40.992
But why did you do it?

18:41.232 --> 18:43.598
I don't know. I think I was still high.

18:46.370 --> 18:49.533
Will, how long have you been
taking drugs?

18:49.940 --> 18:52.340
Come on, man, I ain't taking no drugs.

18:53.044 --> 18:55.569
All right, look, I thought about it, but...

18:56.113 --> 18:57.910
Look, you wouldn't understand, man.

18:57.982 --> 19:01.679
Will, you're not the only one
who's ever thought about taking drugs.

19:02.319 --> 19:04.480
- Y ou're kidding.
- Hey, I've got a wild side.

19:04.555 --> 19:07.080
I don't always wear shower shoes
at the gym.

19:10.161 --> 19:12.652
I can't even believe you thought about it.

19:13.097 --> 19:17.591
Y eah, but after last night,
I'll never think about it again.

19:19.503 --> 19:22.404
Y eah, and when Uncle Phil finds out
you'll never see me again.

19:22.473 --> 19:23.735
Look, Will...

19:25.376 --> 19:27.310
he's not gonna find out.

19:28.012 --> 19:30.446
Let's just put this all behind us.

19:31.348 --> 19:34.340
Hey, Carlton, look, I'm sorry, man.

19:34.418 --> 19:37.353
I mean, you're my homey,
and I almost took you out.

19:38.456 --> 19:41.357
I love you, man. I never meant to hurt you.

19:42.827 --> 19:44.055
I know.

19:47.398 --> 19:48.956
I'm sorry, man.

19:49.934 --> 19:51.401
- Will?
- Y o?

19:51.602 --> 19:54.002
Y ou haven't showered yet today,
have you?

19:58.409 --> 20:01.810
- Hey, Uncle Phil.
- Hey, Will, how's my favorite nephew?

20:05.583 --> 20:08.984
- Y ou talking to me?
- Y ou know, I have something for you.

20:09.086 --> 20:11.680
I was gonna save it for graduation...

20:11.756 --> 20:15.021
but after what you did,
I think I'll give it to you now.

20:16.193 --> 20:19.993
- Y o, season tickets to the Clippers.
- That's right, courtside.

20:25.369 --> 20:27.530
I can't take this, Uncle Phil.

20:30.374 --> 20:33.434
- There's something I need to tell you.
- What is it?

20:36.046 --> 20:38.378
Those pills that Carlton took...

20:40.017 --> 20:41.985
they were from my locker.

20:42.186 --> 20:43.278
What?

20:43.454 --> 20:46.514
Look, Uncle Phil, I was just keeping them
in case I needed them.

20:46.590 --> 20:48.888
How could you be so stupid?

20:48.959 --> 20:50.927
Y ou know
you shouldn't be messing with drugs.

20:50.995 --> 20:53.964
I know, Uncle Phil.
Somebody gave them to me at school.

20:54.031 --> 20:55.794
I mean, I didn't mean
for Carlton to take them.

20:55.866 --> 20:57.697
I didn't even know
if I was going to take them.

20:57.768 --> 21:00.532
- I'm sorry, Uncle Phil.
- Sorry?

21:03.140 --> 21:05.768
My son could have died because of you.

21:05.943 --> 21:08.741
Look, I know, Uncle Phil,
that's all I've been thinking about.

21:08.813 --> 21:11.008
I mean, you gotta believe me.
I didn't mean to hurt him.

21:11.081 --> 21:12.207
Y eah, well, you did.

21:12.283 --> 21:15.047
Y ou hurt him,
and you could have hurt yourself.

21:16.320 --> 21:18.185
I know, Uncle Phil, I mean...

21:18.255 --> 21:22.749
But, look, I had basketball practice,
and school, and I had work and everything.

21:22.827 --> 21:24.488
Welcome to the real world, Will.

21:24.562 --> 21:27.190
That's not an excuse.
There's never an excuse.

21:27.765 --> 21:31.166
Y ou owe this family an apology.
Vivian! Kids!

21:33.904 --> 21:35.929
- What's going on?
- Will has something to tell you.

21:36.006 --> 21:38.406
- Come on, Uncle Phil, don't make me...
- Go ahead, Will.

21:44.849 --> 21:49.115
The pills that Carlton took,
they were from my locker.

21:49.253 --> 21:52.051
- What?
- I'm sorry, Aunt Viv.

21:53.457 --> 21:57.518
I mean, I had basketball practice,
and I had finals, and everything...

22:01.732 --> 22:05.395
and one of the guys at school
just offered me some stuff...

22:05.469 --> 22:07.334
to help me stay awake.

22:09.673 --> 22:11.470
And then Carlton...

22:15.079 --> 22:19.573
Look, all I know is
that somebody real close to me...

22:20.150 --> 22:23.813
that I love a whole lot
could be dead right now...

22:24.989 --> 22:27.184
and it would be all my fault.

22:29.560 --> 22:31.084
I'm sorry, man.

22:33.030 --> 22:34.019
I'm sorry.

22:37.034 --> 22:38.399
Come here. Come here.

22:38.936 --> 22:41.905
- I'm sorry I did it.
- It's okay. Come on.

22:50.314 --> 22:53.647
Somebody call a cop
'cause it has got to be...

22:58.088 --> 23:00.522
Somebody call a cop 'cause this has...

23:06.430 --> 23:07.829
y ou'll get it.
