38:03.807 --> 38:06.975
so I don't know
how old they are,

38:06.977 --> 38:08.327
but who cares?

38:08.329 --> 38:10.329
If you're alive
in the apocalypse,

38:10.331 --> 38:13.815
you're like
150 years old anyway.

38:13.817 --> 38:15.501
I don't know
where they're from.

38:15.503 --> 38:17.336
Nowhere and everywhere,
probably,

38:17.338 --> 38:19.821
just like everyone else.

38:19.823 --> 38:24.067
I'm from Pittsburgh
by way of San Juan,

38:24.069 --> 38:27.070
but do cities and states
and countries even exist

38:27.072 --> 38:29.348
or matter anymore?

38:29.350 --> 38:31.683
We've been on the road
for a week.

38:31.685 --> 38:33.593
We had bikes
for a while.

38:33.595 --> 38:35.187
Then we walked.

38:35.189 --> 38:37.264
That's how we got here.

38:37.266 --> 38:38.749
Why am I here?

38:38.751 --> 38:40.192
To be with them.

38:40.194 --> 38:45.847
And their names are
Eugene, Yumiko, and Ezekiel.

38:45.849 --> 38:48.367
But you
already knew that.

38:48.369 --> 38:52.279
And my name
is Princess.

38:52.281 --> 38:55.374
That's good.
Thank you.

38:55.376 --> 38:57.835
The rifle.

39:13.118 --> 39:15.619
See?

39:15.621 --> 39:17.804
Didn't have to be hard.

39:17.806 --> 39:19.380
The rules are simple.

39:19.382 --> 39:21.474
The questions
are routine.

39:21.476 --> 39:23.718
People just
complicate them.

39:23.720 --> 39:27.072
Just needed to know
you could play ball with us.

39:31.245 --> 39:35.747
So -- So when can I see
my friends?

39:37.326 --> 39:38.642
Right now.

39:38.644 --> 39:40.477
I got her!
Let's go!
