00:39.706 --> 00:41.166
Sun baiyi.

00:43.377 --> 00:44.503
Thanks.

00:44.503 --> 00:46.547
So, where is it?

00:47.548 --> 00:49.508
Give me a moment to look.

00:50.634 --> 00:52.010
You know,
it still kind of blows my mind

00:52.010 --> 00:54.471
that you knew
Leonardo da Vinci.

00:54.471 --> 00:55.848
Biblically.

00:55.848 --> 00:57.933
Hmm.
I loved him very much.

00:57.933 --> 01:00.143
When we met,
he was not a legend.

01:00.143 --> 01:01.728
Merely a starving artist.

01:01.728 --> 01:03.397
Who you inspired
to greatness.

01:03.397 --> 01:04.690
Kind of sucks that he got
all the credit.

01:04.690 --> 01:06.024
Right?

01:06.024 --> 01:07.651
Such is history.

01:07.651 --> 01:09.069
Many who shape it
are never acknowledged

01:09.069 --> 01:10.362
for their achievements.

01:11.822 --> 01:13.699
Hmm. Case in point.

01:18.453 --> 01:20.247
This is what we came for.

01:20.247 --> 01:21.290
Halt!

01:22.291 --> 01:24.585
Two intruders

Landon!

01:39.725 --> 01:41.351
Such violence is not necessary.

01:41.351 --> 01:43.061
That's pretty ironic,
coming from you.

01:43.061 --> 01:44.646
Now will you tell me

01:44.646 --> 01:46.773
how you know that can help us
defeat Malivore?

01:46.773 --> 01:48.692

02:07.336 --> 02:09.379
Oh, admit it.

02:10.506 --> 02:12.299
You totally missed me.

02:12.299 --> 02:14.843
I'm not going to dignify that
with an answer.

02:14.843 --> 02:17.179
I will, however, indignify it
with a question.

02:17.179 --> 02:18.847
How are you even here?

02:18.847 --> 02:21.183
Long story short, uh,
someone chopped off my head.

02:21.183 --> 02:23.435
Woke up in the blackness,
endless loneliness,

02:23.435 --> 02:26.063
suffering, existential agony,
blah blah blah.

02:26.063 --> 02:27.814
And then an industrious
Triad witch

02:27.814 --> 02:29.066
brought me back
to the here and now.

02:29.066 --> 02:30.859
Where you've
obviously made

02:30.859 --> 02:32.486
no progress
in killing Malivore.

02:32.486 --> 02:34.530
We did manage to lock him
in a prison world.

02:34.530 --> 02:35.656
Well,
there's no prison

02:35.656 --> 02:36.949
that will contain my father.

02:36.949 --> 02:38.116
You know it.

02:39.326 --> 02:40.911
Is he still sending monsters?

02:42.412 --> 02:43.830
A couple.

02:43.830 --> 02:45.916
Jo, stop giving him
information.

02:45.916 --> 02:47.417
That goes for you, too.

02:48.418 --> 02:49.711
Then he's up to something.

02:50.921 --> 02:53.298
But lucky for us,
I have a plan.

02:53.298 --> 02:56.468
What kind of plan?
Not interested. Ad somnum.

02:58.345 --> 02:59.805
Lizzie...
Don't.

02:59.805 --> 03:02.099
Okay?
Have you completely forgotten

03:02.099 --> 03:04.226
that Clarke once
faked being Vardemus,

03:04.226 --> 03:05.561
turned Josie evil,

03:05.561 --> 03:08.063
and then tried
to hijack your body?

03:08.063 --> 03:10.399
Not to mention a zillion
other shady things.

03:10.399 --> 03:11.900
We are not trusting him.

03:11.900 --> 03:13.193
Fine, then what's your plan?

03:13.193 --> 03:14.862
Take him back
to the school

03:14.862 --> 03:16.572
and let the grown-ups deal
with something for once.

03:26.623 --> 03:27.708
So,

03:27.708 --> 03:29.084
do we have
your permission?

03:29.084 --> 03:30.961
I don't know.

03:30.961 --> 03:33.714
Cleo made it pretty clear
when she left the school,

03:33.714 --> 03:35.507
she wasn't interested
in being found.

03:35.507 --> 03:37.384
Yeah, so did MG,
but you got him back.

03:37.384 --> 03:39.052
And now he and I are good.

03:39.052 --> 03:41.138
And in that same spirit
of open communication,

03:41.138 --> 03:42.472
there's just some...

03:42.472 --> 03:44.099
stuff I got to get
off my chest

03:44.099 --> 03:46.560
that I didn't get a chance to
before Cleo took off.

03:46.560 --> 03:49.688
And continuing
in that same spirit,

03:49.688 --> 03:53.066
we were hoping that you'd
want to help us find her

03:53.066 --> 03:55.235
so we didn't just find a witch

03:55.235 --> 03:56.695
to do the spell
behind your back.

03:58.822 --> 04:01.909
Well, I do appreciate
you coming to me.

04:02.993 --> 04:04.536
And as a matter of fact...

04:05.495 --> 04:09.249
Last night two thieves
broke into a museum

04:09.249 --> 04:10.959
in Alexandria and stole
a sculpture

04:10.959 --> 04:12.711
on loan from
the Italian government.

04:12.711 --> 04:14.963
When the guards on duty
attempted to subdue them,

04:14.963 --> 04:17.674
one spontaneously fell asleep.

04:17.674 --> 04:19.301
The other was
violently assaulted

04:19.301 --> 04:21.637
but not before
he managed to get a look...

04:21.637 --> 04:23.138
at his assailants.

04:25.057 --> 04:26.183
What?

04:26.183 --> 04:27.601
Why would Cleo rob a museum?

04:28.602 --> 04:30.103
And when'd she
team up with Landon?

04:30.103 --> 04:32.314
I don't know,
but that sculpture is

04:32.314 --> 04:34.775
from the studio
of Leonardo da Vinci.

04:34.775 --> 04:37.778
Likely had something
to do with Cleo's past.

04:37.778 --> 04:40.489
She won't have much of a future
if she keeps pulling B and Es.

04:40.489 --> 04:42.074
My thoughts exactly.

04:43.075 --> 04:44.535
Permission granted

04:44.535 --> 04:47.246
for our first official
superhero mission?

04:49.039 --> 04:50.541
Cover up their tracks.

04:50.541 --> 04:52.459
Figure out
what they're up to.

04:52.459 --> 04:54.044
Discreetly.

04:54.044 --> 04:56.255
Discreet Dynamic Duo
on the case.

04:56.255 --> 04:58.006
Are you ready for this,
old chum?

04:58.006 --> 04:59.925
Yeah.
To the Batmobile, yo.

04:59.925 --> 05:01.593
Yeah.
Thanks.

05:04.680 --> 05:06.431
My blood sugar is crashing,

05:06.431 --> 05:08.433
and my bladder is splashing.

05:08.433 --> 05:09.810
I'm gonna go grab
some snacks.

05:09.810 --> 05:11.311
Anyone want to come with?

05:11.311 --> 05:13.105
I will once the tank is full.

05:13.105 --> 05:15.566
In the meantime, can you get me
a Razzleberry slush?

05:15.566 --> 05:18.485
Only because genetics dictate
that I love you.

05:19.194 --> 05:20.237
Hope?

05:26.076 --> 05:28.620
Seeing Clarke
must be traumatizing for you

05:28.620 --> 05:30.330
after everything
that happened.

05:30.330 --> 05:33.125
I'm starting to think
that traumatized is

05:33.125 --> 05:34.418
my permanent resting state.

05:34.418 --> 05:35.878
Don't you think
that'd change

05:35.878 --> 05:37.504
if we ended Malivore,
once and for all?

05:37.504 --> 05:39.214
I do.

05:39.214 --> 05:41.258
But if you think Clarke is
gonna help that...

05:41.258 --> 05:43.218
What I think is that

05:43.218 --> 05:45.554
our only other option is
me going full Tribrid.

05:45.554 --> 05:46.597
You said we'd find
another way,

05:46.597 --> 05:48.140
but What if this is it?

05:48.140 --> 05:49.850
Then we can figure it
out at the school,

05:49.850 --> 05:52.728
which Clarke's lies
almost destroyed, along with me.

05:52.728 --> 05:54.354
And as much as I believe
that everybody deserves

05:54.354 --> 05:55.772
a chance at redemption,

05:55.772 --> 05:58.025
I cannot bring myself
to trust Clarke.

05:59.526 --> 06:01.236
Neither should you, Hope.

06:02.112 --> 06:03.530
You're right.

06:03.530 --> 06:05.449
I'll just have to find
another way.

06:23.050 --> 06:26.094
Your actions could have
jeopardized my entire mission.

06:26.094 --> 06:28.138
You're seriously gonna
lecture me about violence?

06:28.138 --> 06:30.140
I literally had to stop
you from murdering Hope.

06:30.140 --> 06:31.558
This is our mission.

06:31.558 --> 06:32.851
We're supposed to be
in this together.

06:32.851 --> 06:33.852
Yes, we are,
but after last night,

06:33.852 --> 06:35.312
I've realized you're not

06:35.312 --> 06:37.064
the same Landon Kirby
I saw in Hope's heart.

06:37.064 --> 06:38.941
Oh, you mean the fake
Landon Kirby you created

06:38.941 --> 06:40.442
in order to fool Hope into
thinking you had saved me

06:40.442 --> 06:41.443
from the prison world?

06:41.443 --> 06:42.903
That Landon Kirby?

06:42.903 --> 06:45.239
I have spent centuries running
from Malivore.

06:45.239 --> 06:46.365
All that I have done,
right or wrong,

06:46.365 --> 06:47.950
has been so I may stop doing so.

06:47.950 --> 06:49.993
That is why I agreed
to this partnership.

06:49.993 --> 06:51.912
Because I believed you,
of all people,

06:51.912 --> 06:53.580
would understand this.

06:53.580 --> 06:55.249
Wonderful.

06:55.249 --> 06:57.251
I've lost my keycard.
Tell me you have yours.

07:00.254 --> 07:02.130
Look...

07:02.130 --> 07:04.216
I want Malivore gone
as much as you do.

07:06.260 --> 07:07.845
But for this to work,
you're gonna have to learn

07:07.845 --> 07:09.137
to trust me.

07:16.562 --> 07:18.522
You have 30 seconds
to convince me of your plan.

07:19.231 --> 07:20.691
28 seconds, now.

07:20.691 --> 07:22.150
W-- If Malivore's still
sending monsters,

07:22.150 --> 07:23.569
that means there has to be
a portal.

07:23.569 --> 07:24.778
I can lead you to it.

07:26.989 --> 07:28.198
Five seconds. How?

07:28.198 --> 07:29.825
Those portals are Malivore mud.

07:29.825 --> 07:31.577
You know what else is made
of that stuff?

07:31.577 --> 07:32.661
Me.

07:34.162 --> 07:36.373
One locator spell,
and we both can finally be free.

07:46.175 --> 07:48.677
Son of a bitch.

07:53.807 --> 07:55.684
Aren't you two a little young
to be detectives?

07:57.686 --> 07:59.813
This is our first case.

07:59.813 --> 08:01.982
So please, just
help us crack it.

08:01.982 --> 08:02.983
Are these the two perps

08:02.983 --> 08:04.026
that you encountered?

08:05.110 --> 08:06.904
That's them--
she stole the sculpture,

08:06.904 --> 08:08.572
and he...

08:08.572 --> 08:10.032
he beat the crap out of me.

08:10.032 --> 08:11.825
I'll never forget their faces.

08:12.659 --> 08:14.411
Well, sir...

08:14.411 --> 08:15.704
you're about to.

08:19.082 --> 08:20.417
You don't remember
anything--

08:20.417 --> 08:21.793
the perps' faces,
what they stole.

08:21.793 --> 08:23.045
Walk away.

08:23.045 --> 08:24.922
So?

08:24.922 --> 08:26.507
Have you given it any thought?

08:26.507 --> 08:28.133
Oh, y-yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:28.133 --> 08:30.511
I got a couple superhero
names worked out right here.

08:30.511 --> 08:32.930
Fire and Ice.
Tooth and Nail.

08:32.930 --> 08:34.264
Hustle and Flow.

08:34.264 --> 08:35.557
I'm Flow.

08:35.557 --> 08:37.601
Cool, um...

08:37.601 --> 08:39.353
But I kind of hate
all of those.

08:39.353 --> 08:40.562
What I meant was,

08:40.562 --> 08:42.147
have you given any more thought

08:42.147 --> 08:44.191
to what you're gonna say
to Cleo when we find her?

08:44.191 --> 08:46.818
Oh... that.

08:46.818 --> 08:48.028
Yeah. I mean,

08:48.028 --> 08:49.238
I don't know. I...

08:49.238 --> 08:50.489
I'm just gonna
lay it all

08:50.489 --> 08:52.115
on the table,
you know.

08:52.115 --> 08:54.368
Straight up tell her how I feel,
just like you said.

08:54.368 --> 08:55.786
Now all we got to do is
figure out where Cleo

08:55.786 --> 08:57.287
and Landon are holed up

08:57.287 --> 08:59.373
and why you're crouched
on the ground,

08:59.373 --> 09:00.791
sniffing stuff.

09:01.750 --> 09:03.293
Boom.

09:03.293 --> 09:04.753
Bump and Grind.

09:04.753 --> 09:06.129
Killing it.

09:09.132 --> 09:11.176
Why are we stopping here?

09:12.135 --> 09:13.804
So there won't be
any witnesses.

09:14.680 --> 09:16.765
Relax, I'm only sort of kidding.

09:16.765 --> 09:19.017
As a general rule,
I like to practice magic

09:19.017 --> 09:21.603
without any prying eyes around,
so...

09:21.603 --> 09:22.938
Oh, speaking of that, uh,

09:22.938 --> 09:24.565
don't you think
we should get

09:24.565 --> 09:26.066
a little further away
from the Wonder Twins

09:26.066 --> 09:27.276
before we do anything?

09:27.276 --> 09:28.861
You're stalling.

09:28.861 --> 09:30.028
What are you not telling me?

09:30.028 --> 09:32.239
I...

09:32.239 --> 09:34.157
Okay, fine. Have it your way.

09:34.157 --> 09:35.617
Imitantor pupulis.

09:35.617 --> 09:37.202
Not that spell again.

09:37.202 --> 09:39.746
Clarke, when are you ever
gonna learn your lesson?

09:39.746 --> 09:41.874
Hope, I promise.
I've changed.

09:41.874 --> 09:43.917
Okay? I'm not the monster
you think I am.

09:43.917 --> 09:45.586
Yeah. We'll see.

09:54.178 --> 09:55.971
That's not Malivore mud.

09:57.431 --> 09:59.308
Like I said,

09:59.308 --> 10:01.226
I've changed.

10:03.312 --> 10:04.938
Pada si ibi ti wa.

10:12.487 --> 10:13.530
You made that from Maligoo?

10:13.530 --> 10:15.032
I did.

10:15.032 --> 10:16.867
It is quite malleable,
much like clay,

10:16.867 --> 10:18.327
very artist-friendly.

10:18.327 --> 10:20.579
So, let's say this spell works,

10:20.579 --> 10:21.997
we find the portal.

10:21.997 --> 10:23.874
What next?
We seal it, obviously.

10:23.874 --> 10:25.042
How?

10:25.042 --> 10:26.585
We need Hope's blood for that.

10:30.422 --> 10:32.716
I took some from
the school's medical supplies

10:32.716 --> 10:34.843
when Hope and I were running
tests on the golem.

10:34.843 --> 10:36.678
This will trap Malivore
in the prison world long enough

10:36.678 --> 10:38.805
to find a way to eliminate him.

10:38.805 --> 10:42.809
And as a muse, I am confident
inspiration will come.

10:47.147 --> 10:48.565
The mud is not moving.

10:48.565 --> 10:50.234
What does that mean?

10:50.234 --> 10:54.196
It means the spell has
failed for some reason.

10:54.196 --> 10:56.073
And that all this
was for nothing.

11:06.792 --> 11:08.335
Nobody at school is

11:08.335 --> 11:09.962
answering the phone.

11:09.962 --> 11:12.589
So, what, we're just supposed
to walk home?

11:12.589 --> 11:14.341
I'm more concerned about Hope.

11:14.341 --> 11:15.926
Clarke obviously talked her
into doing something,

11:15.926 --> 11:17.261
and it's probably not good.

11:17.261 --> 11:18.595
Hope made her choice.

11:18.595 --> 11:20.722
And she clearly
didn't choose us.

11:20.722 --> 11:22.766
Then I guess my next
question is "Why?"

11:22.766 --> 11:25.853
I'm guessing it has to do
with Malivore's other son.

11:25.853 --> 11:26.979
As usual.

11:26.979 --> 11:28.397
Landon makes
Hope happy.

11:28.397 --> 11:29.982
Though, admittedly,
their breakup

11:29.982 --> 11:32.025
probably wasn't the best
for her mental state.

11:33.360 --> 11:36.572
Which is why we need to strike
while the iron is hot.

11:36.572 --> 11:38.574
Strike what, exactly?

11:38.574 --> 11:41.493
Hope is technically single
and ready to mingle,

11:41.493 --> 11:43.996
so this is our shot
to break that cycle.

11:43.996 --> 11:46.498
And, as her two best friends
in the entire world,

11:46.498 --> 11:48.542
it's practically our sacred duty

11:48.542 --> 11:50.335
to help her find someone new.

11:50.335 --> 11:53.505
Before she inevitably
moves heaven and earth

11:53.505 --> 11:55.299
to try and get back with Landon.

11:55.299 --> 11:57.009
You're saying it is
our sacred duty

11:57.009 --> 11:58.635
to get Hope a rebound?

11:58.635 --> 11:59.761
Mm-hmm.

11:59.761 --> 12:00.888
Lizzie, with who?

12:00.888 --> 12:02.472
We can't afford to be picky.

12:03.724 --> 12:06.351
Anyone who won't dissolve
into a puddle of goo

12:06.351 --> 12:08.562
when they have sex will do.

12:08.562 --> 12:11.440
I am more concerned
about Hope's actual life

12:11.440 --> 12:13.066
than her romantic one.

12:13.066 --> 12:15.694
Clarke is a master
manipulator and a killer.

12:15.694 --> 12:17.863
And, what, you think
some eligible whatever

12:17.863 --> 12:19.698
is gonna just fall
out of the sky?

12:25.537 --> 12:28.582
Saltzman twins.
Do you need a lift?

12:30.334 --> 12:32.419
Target acquired.

12:36.131 --> 12:39.635
If you are here to try
and make me feel better,

12:39.635 --> 12:41.553
you will only fail,
as I have.

12:41.553 --> 12:45.224
Well... we're
still partners.

12:45.224 --> 12:47.351
So I got to try.

12:50.270 --> 12:53.815
You know, I know what
it's like to feel trapped.

12:53.815 --> 12:56.777
That no matter what you do,
you can't break free.

12:58.987 --> 13:01.406
When I was in
the prison world,

13:01.406 --> 13:03.700
I was always looking
over my shoulder.

13:03.700 --> 13:05.827
Being constantly pursued
by monsters.

13:07.287 --> 13:08.747
I never knew how
I was going to get out.

13:08.747 --> 13:10.499
Or if or when
Malivore might show up

13:10.499 --> 13:11.583
and devour me all over again.

13:11.583 --> 13:13.669
I felt the same way

13:13.669 --> 13:15.754
after I escaped his captivity
and fled to Italy.

13:15.754 --> 13:18.298
There,
I found love...

13:18.298 --> 13:20.300
and I swore I would never
be his prisoner again.

13:20.300 --> 13:21.677
You won't be.

13:21.677 --> 13:24.513
How can you be so sure?

13:24.513 --> 13:26.515
I can't.

13:26.515 --> 13:29.017
But I can promise that

13:29.017 --> 13:31.603
anyone that wants to get to you
is gonna have to go through me.

13:33.772 --> 13:35.607
In that case, you were right.

13:35.607 --> 13:36.942
You feel better?

13:36.942 --> 13:38.735
Yes.

13:38.735 --> 13:41.446
But more importantly,
I believe I must trust you.

13:42.906 --> 13:46.076
Because I've just had
another idea.

13:50.122 --> 13:52.457
Are you kidding me with this?

13:52.457 --> 13:54.001
So you're human now?

13:54.001 --> 13:56.378
Thank you for acknowledging
the gravity.

13:56.378 --> 13:58.338
I-It's a pretty big
life moment for me.

13:58.338 --> 13:59.506
And it's going to be
a short one

13:59.506 --> 14:00.883
if you don't explain yourself.

14:00.883 --> 14:03.135
I will. But can you drop
the mimic spell?

14:03.135 --> 14:05.387
Okay, I can't focus.

14:05.387 --> 14:07.055
Thank you.

14:07.055 --> 14:09.725
So, several decades ago,

14:09.725 --> 14:11.143
when I was working for Triad,

14:11.143 --> 14:12.936
I set out to find
a way to break the cycle

14:12.936 --> 14:15.439
of torment and abuse my father
keeps putting me through.

14:15.439 --> 14:17.441
But I couldn't
figure out how,

14:17.441 --> 14:19.651
until I learned
of an artifact

14:19.651 --> 14:21.987
that was capable of granting
my heart's desire.

14:21.987 --> 14:23.530
Made by Leonardo da Vinci,

14:23.530 --> 14:25.282
which had a muse locked
inside of it.

14:25.282 --> 14:27.409
You opened it?

14:27.409 --> 14:29.077
I spent years trying.
How the hell?

14:29.077 --> 14:30.913
Yet another burden

14:30.913 --> 14:32.247
that being the Tribrid makes me

14:32.247 --> 14:33.999
uniquely suited to carry.

14:33.999 --> 14:36.335
A muse, huh?

14:36.335 --> 14:38.212
Well, I guess that explains how
sleeping with that artifact

14:38.212 --> 14:39.755
under my proverbial pillow
inspired me

14:39.755 --> 14:41.215
to use a witch
to bring me back to life.

14:41.215 --> 14:43.050
Yeah. In annoyingly human form.

14:43.050 --> 14:45.928
Oh, well, I've always wanted
to be a real boy.

14:45.928 --> 14:47.804
Because it means
Malivore can't control me.

14:47.804 --> 14:49.473
It also means
that you pitched me a plan

14:49.473 --> 14:50.974
that you knew
would never work.

14:50.974 --> 14:53.560
I never say never. Just...

14:53.560 --> 14:55.187
give it a minute, will you?

14:55.187 --> 14:56.897
You're missing what's
important here, Hope.

14:56.897 --> 14:59.191
I've got literal skin
in the game now.

14:59.191 --> 15:00.776
Okay? I'm not
trying to trick you,

15:00.776 --> 15:02.945
because once Malivore
finds out I'm free,

15:02.945 --> 15:05.155
he's going to want to kill me.

15:05.155 --> 15:06.573
And if that happens,

15:06.573 --> 15:08.617
I won't just resurrect like you

15:08.617 --> 15:10.577
or my birdbrain little brother.

15:12.788 --> 15:14.873
Okay, wh... Uh,
I'm clearly missing something.

15:16.083 --> 15:17.626
Landon's not a phoenix anymore.

15:18.627 --> 15:20.796
And he's not my boyfriend
either, so...

15:20.796 --> 15:22.756
Before you ask-- don't.

15:22.756 --> 15:24.508
Huh.

15:24.508 --> 15:26.301
I always thought you two
were destined to be together.

15:26.301 --> 15:29.137
Well, destiny disagrees.

15:29.137 --> 15:31.849
There's not a damn thing
I can do to change it.

15:33.267 --> 15:35.102
The spell...

15:35.102 --> 15:37.020
it's working.

15:40.732 --> 15:42.734
Well, so much for never.

15:42.734 --> 15:44.778
I guess blood
is thicker than mud.

15:44.778 --> 15:46.864
Shut up. Get in the car.

15:54.580 --> 15:56.248
I know you're dying
to get there,

15:56.248 --> 15:58.208
but I'd like to avoid dying
on the way.

15:58.208 --> 15:59.918
So... slow down?

15:59.918 --> 16:01.920
The minute that we
close that portal

16:01.920 --> 16:04.047
is the same minute that we never
have to see each other again.

16:04.047 --> 16:06.925
So I suggest you buckle
your human ass up.
What?

16:06.925 --> 16:08.760
That is not what this is about
and you know it.

16:08.760 --> 16:10.721
It's about Landon.

16:12.264 --> 16:14.474
Did you forget our
little chat about destiny?

16:14.474 --> 16:16.143
He was born to be
Malivore's vessel

16:16.143 --> 16:17.519
and I was born
to be the only one

16:17.519 --> 16:19.062
capable of
destroying Malivore.

16:19.062 --> 16:21.190
So...
That's about as incompatible

16:21.190 --> 16:23.942
as dating a guy
who has cats.

16:23.942 --> 16:26.778
Well, hey. If a mud man
like me can beat his fate...

16:26.778 --> 16:29.615
maybe you crazy kids
can, too.

16:29.615 --> 16:32.117
But you already believe
that, don't you?

16:36.747 --> 16:37.998
All right, we're close.

16:37.998 --> 16:39.499
Take the next exit.

16:43.754 --> 16:44.922
Wait, I-I'm confused.

16:44.922 --> 16:45.923
So who's gonna be Sound

16:45.923 --> 16:47.049
and who's gonna be Fury?

16:47.925 --> 16:49.885
It's a work in progress.

16:49.885 --> 16:51.929
Just know we got Cleo and
Landon's tracks covered.

16:51.929 --> 16:54.473
And a lead on their location.
The Morning Bird Motel.

16:54.473 --> 16:56.058
We're headed there now.

16:56.058 --> 16:57.601
All right, I'll meet you there.
Nice work.

17:01.271 --> 17:03.732
Got about an hour
before we see Cleo.

17:03.732 --> 17:04.900
Yeah.

17:04.900 --> 17:06.360
You might want to practice

17:06.360 --> 17:07.778
what you're gonna say.

17:08.987 --> 17:10.489
Man, I been playing out

17:10.489 --> 17:12.115
what I'm gonna say
in my head for days.

17:12.115 --> 17:14.701
I can really only
think of one thing.

17:14.701 --> 17:17.079
I'm sorry.

17:17.079 --> 17:19.706
I'm sorry for...

17:19.706 --> 17:22.209
not taking her word
when I should have.

17:22.209 --> 17:24.378
And damn sorry for
not telling her

17:24.378 --> 17:26.088
how I felt when
I had the chance.

17:26.088 --> 17:27.589
'Cause, to tell
you the truth,

17:27.589 --> 17:29.633
it's been a long-ass
time since anyone ever

17:29.633 --> 17:32.928
made me feel like I do
when I'm with Cleo.

17:32.928 --> 17:34.680
And ain't
no one ever

17:34.680 --> 17:37.224
inspired me to want

17:37.224 --> 17:41.186
to open my heart and...

17:41.186 --> 17:43.397
...I don't know,
be the best version of myself

17:43.397 --> 17:45.607
the way she makes me want to be.

17:49.570 --> 17:50.654
So what you think?

17:50.654 --> 17:51.905
She gonna feel that,

17:51.905 --> 17:53.282
or am I gonna crash and burn?

17:54.700 --> 17:55.993
Look out!
What?

18:00.330 --> 18:02.541
Damn, man, this is bad.

18:02.541 --> 18:04.251
Ambulances aren't here yet.

18:04.251 --> 18:05.919
Folks down there could be hurt.
We got to do something.

18:05.919 --> 18:07.296
What about Landon and Cleo?

18:07.296 --> 18:09.506
They'll just have to wait.

18:13.552 --> 18:14.928
'Cause it's hero time.

18:17.264 --> 18:18.682
I'm not saying
that Hope Mikaelson

18:18.682 --> 18:20.017
is my own personal hero.

18:20.017 --> 18:21.810
I just don't know

18:21.810 --> 18:24.646
what any of us at this school
would do without her.

18:24.646 --> 18:27.399
So you've been saying
the whole ride here.

18:27.399 --> 18:29.693
Though I'm not exactly sure why.

18:29.693 --> 18:32.070
I just want you to know
how awesome Hope is.

18:33.363 --> 18:34.323
'Cause she is.

18:34.323 --> 18:37.576
Oh, yeah. For sure.

18:37.576 --> 18:39.870
I had no idea

18:39.870 --> 18:41.371
this place was so fancy.

18:41.371 --> 18:43.123
I get why you wanted
to come back here, Jo.

18:43.123 --> 18:44.499
Sure beats public school.

18:47.169 --> 18:48.962
Why don't I give you a tour?

18:50.714 --> 18:53.425
And then we can keep talking.

18:53.425 --> 18:56.345
That sounds like
a really bad idea, Lizzie.

18:56.345 --> 18:57.971
We still have to
tell Dad about Hope's

18:57.971 --> 19:00.974
surprise field trip.

19:00.974 --> 19:02.768
You're right.

19:02.768 --> 19:05.521
Which is why you should
run along and do that

19:05.521 --> 19:08.232
while I show Ethan
Hope's home away from home.

19:10.234 --> 19:11.610
Sound good?

19:11.610 --> 19:12.611
Great. I'm in.

19:15.906 --> 19:17.783
Finch.
What's up?

19:17.783 --> 19:19.743
Jo? Hey.

19:19.743 --> 19:21.662
I got worried when you didn't
show up for Magical Agronomy.

19:21.662 --> 19:22.996
When'd you get back?

19:22.996 --> 19:25.874
Just now.
It's been, um... a day.

19:25.874 --> 19:27.084
Are you okay?

19:27.084 --> 19:29.086
Um...

19:29.086 --> 19:30.921
Long story.
I'll tell you later.

19:30.921 --> 19:32.673
Right now I need your help.

19:32.673 --> 19:33.924
Okay?

19:35.300 --> 19:37.469
When was the last time
you inspired someone this way?

19:37.469 --> 19:39.513
Not since the
Renaissance.

19:39.513 --> 19:40.931
Unless you count the time

19:40.931 --> 19:42.516
I had Hope make
that golem of you.

19:42.516 --> 19:44.518
Which, for the record--

19:44.518 --> 19:45.727
impressive.

19:46.353 --> 19:47.813
When we lived in Florence,

19:47.813 --> 19:49.439
Leonardo and I would wake
every morning

19:49.439 --> 19:51.650
to watch the sun rise
from the Ponte Vecchio

19:51.650 --> 19:54.611
while my powers inspired
his creativity.

19:54.611 --> 19:55.779
Sounds romantic.

19:55.779 --> 19:57.197
It was more
than that.

19:57.197 --> 19:58.198
It was the ultimate
demonstration

19:58.198 --> 19:59.783
of our love and trust,

19:59.783 --> 20:02.494
which gave rise to
his greatest creations.

20:02.494 --> 20:04.496
Perhaps it will do
the same for you,

20:04.496 --> 20:06.039
so that you can help
me against Malivore

20:06.039 --> 20:08.000
as Da Vinci once did.

20:08.000 --> 20:11.461
Following in the footsteps of
the greatest Renaissance man.

20:11.461 --> 20:13.338
No pressure there.

20:14.339 --> 20:15.799
It is good
that you are humble, but...

20:15.799 --> 20:17.551
you need not be afraid.

20:21.680 --> 20:23.432
Simply focus
your thoughts

20:23.432 --> 20:25.726
and true inspiration
will come, hmm?

20:38.906 --> 20:40.073
I'm not feeling anything.

20:40.073 --> 20:41.825
It will come.

20:41.825 --> 20:44.077
Just look into my eyes
and open up your mind to me.

20:55.297 --> 20:57.007
What do you feel now?

20:57.007 --> 21:00.761
The world is a... pebble

21:00.761 --> 21:04.848
in a vast,
infinite ocean of light

21:04.848 --> 21:06.558
and darkness,

21:06.558 --> 21:09.144
full of possibilities.

21:09.144 --> 21:10.938
It is not a pebble,
it is a seed.

21:10.938 --> 21:12.856
The shell of an idea.

21:12.856 --> 21:15.067
Now, narrow your focus
on our problem

21:15.067 --> 21:16.777
and pick it up.

21:17.986 --> 21:19.196
Allow the idea

21:19.196 --> 21:20.781
inside to take root and grow.

21:22.699 --> 21:24.409
Landon, I love you.

21:34.670 --> 21:37.130
I know what I have to do.

21:55.816 --> 21:56.942
Hope.

21:58.652 --> 22:00.195
What are you doing here?

22:00.195 --> 22:02.489
what were you two doing?

22:07.578 --> 22:09.037
Well, this is awkward.

22:10.205 --> 22:11.498
Clarke.

22:11.498 --> 22:12.624
Baby brother.

22:14.001 --> 22:15.252
Have we met before?

22:16.295 --> 22:17.671
I'm totally getting a vibe.

22:17.671 --> 22:19.631
Who is this tall,
strange man?

22:19.631 --> 22:23.719
Someone I cannot believe Hope
actually agreed to work with.

22:23.719 --> 22:25.220
Not work is more like
it. The spell we did

22:25.220 --> 22:27.181
was supposed to lead
us to the portal.

22:27.181 --> 22:28.223
Not you.

22:29.099 --> 22:30.642
And definitely not you.

22:30.642 --> 22:32.519
We were also searching
for the portal.

22:32.519 --> 22:33.937
In Landon's eyes?

22:34.771 --> 22:36.690
How'd that go?

22:40.611 --> 22:42.654
Let me speak with her.

22:49.328 --> 22:51.246
What exactly
are we trying to cover up?

22:51.246 --> 22:53.582
Everything.
We need to hide anything magical

22:53.582 --> 22:55.709
before Ethan sees
something he shouldn't.

22:55.709 --> 22:57.085
So what if he does?
Can't you have a vampire

22:57.085 --> 22:58.837
wipe his mind?
Been there, done that.

22:58.837 --> 22:59.880
I already feel guilty enough.

22:59.880 --> 23:01.423
Why?

23:03.467 --> 23:05.135
What'd you do to him?

23:05.135 --> 23:07.513
Please just help me.

23:08.722 --> 23:09.932
This way to the dorm lounge.

23:09.932 --> 23:12.601
Oh, God, they're here.
Invisique.

23:12.601 --> 23:14.228
Next we'll swing
by the studio,

23:14.228 --> 23:17.648
so I can show you some
of Hope's amazing art.

23:17.648 --> 23:21.276
Somebody actually once
offered her $91,000

23:21.276 --> 23:22.444
for one of her
sculptures.

23:22.444 --> 23:24.279
Wow, that's a rather large

23:24.279 --> 23:26.198
and oddly specific number.

23:26.198 --> 23:28.033
Because she's awesome.

23:28.033 --> 23:29.243
I'll tell you
what I think is awesome,

23:29.243 --> 23:30.869
is that cannon of yours.

23:30.869 --> 23:32.287
You were
dropping dimes

23:32.287 --> 23:33.956
at last year's
flag football game.

23:33.956 --> 23:35.415
That's a pretty big
compliment, coming from you.

23:36.917 --> 23:38.377
This school must have a field.

23:38.377 --> 23:40.212
For wickery.

23:40.212 --> 23:42.506
Which is like, um,
nerd football. Uh...

23:42.506 --> 23:44.508
I think the Swedish
invented it.

23:44.508 --> 23:45.759
Right.

23:46.760 --> 23:49.054
Do you want to go
toss the ball around?

23:49.054 --> 23:53.183
You can tell me even more
about Hope while we do.

23:53.183 --> 23:55.310
Deal.

23:58.939 --> 24:01.108
Invisique saeclum.

24:01.108 --> 24:03.902
That was close.

24:03.902 --> 24:05.863
Finch?

24:07.573 --> 24:09.449
How did you pull it off?

24:09.449 --> 24:11.034
Becoming human, I mean.

24:11.034 --> 24:12.536
And would you stop
going through my stuff?

24:12.536 --> 24:14.204
I'd be happy to.

24:14.204 --> 24:15.831
If you tell me what you
and what's-her-face were doing

24:15.831 --> 24:17.040
when we showed up.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.210
Oh, come on.

24:20.210 --> 24:21.420
I'm Team Good Guy now.

24:21.420 --> 24:23.005
All about redemption.

24:23.005 --> 24:25.215
There's no judgment
in this dojo.

24:25.215 --> 24:28.385
You might be human, but
you'll always be a monster.

24:28.385 --> 24:29.595
It's in your blood.

24:29.595 --> 24:31.305
Yeah, well,
look who's talking.

24:33.432 --> 24:36.935
Besides, if you've changed
so much, why can't I?

24:36.935 --> 24:38.687
And make no mistake,
you have.

24:38.687 --> 24:41.273
Because the Landon I knew
would have never have left Hope.

24:42.274 --> 24:45.152
I'm a son of Malivore.

24:45.152 --> 24:46.987
Like you.

24:46.987 --> 24:48.572
Which means Hope and I
have no future together.

24:48.572 --> 24:50.365
I've finally accepted that.

24:51.366 --> 24:53.118
You kids give up too easy.

24:54.453 --> 24:56.747
Look, I know we hate
each other and all, but...

24:56.747 --> 24:58.373
don't we hate our father
even more?

24:58.373 --> 25:00.042
This is our chance
to stick it to the old man

25:00.042 --> 25:02.085
and be what he never
wanted us to be.

25:03.754 --> 25:05.297
Brothers.

25:08.217 --> 25:09.718
You're out of your mind.

25:09.718 --> 25:11.470
Dad must have really done
a number on you

25:11.470 --> 25:13.805
in the darkness
this time around.

25:15.265 --> 25:16.725
That's weird.

25:16.725 --> 25:18.727
Because Hope's
the only person I told

25:18.727 --> 25:20.437
about being sent back
to the darkness.

25:25.025 --> 25:26.985
Damn.

25:26.985 --> 25:29.279
Take it easy on me.
Why?

25:29.279 --> 25:31.406
You didn't take it easy
on us at last year's game.

25:34.660 --> 25:36.662
Sorry.

25:36.662 --> 25:38.497
Your arm.

25:38.497 --> 25:40.749
That was a really stupid thing
for me to say.

25:40.749 --> 25:42.334
Ah.

25:43.919 --> 25:46.296
Maybe things happen
for a reason.

25:46.296 --> 25:49.258
Besides, it's not like
you broke it.

25:50.968 --> 25:53.220
Hey, it's all good.

25:53.220 --> 25:55.389
You okay?

25:55.389 --> 25:57.099
We're supposed to be
talking about Hope.

25:58.392 --> 26:00.269
I know we've covered
a lot of ground,

26:00.269 --> 26:03.438
but do you have
any questions?

26:03.438 --> 26:05.524
Now that you mention it,
do you always spend

26:05.524 --> 26:08.944
this much time worrying about
other people's romantic lives?

26:10.696 --> 26:12.990
Not until very recently.

26:12.990 --> 26:14.783
But it beats
talking about my own.

26:14.783 --> 26:16.702
Oh, come on.
It can't be that bad.

26:17.744 --> 26:19.830
Try me.

26:19.830 --> 26:22.124
Uh...

26:22.124 --> 26:26.420
I was seeing this guy
named Sebastian

26:26.420 --> 26:28.547
not too long ago.

26:28.547 --> 26:30.966
But he had to relocate.

26:30.966 --> 26:32.301
Like, permanently.

26:34.595 --> 26:36.013
He had a bit
of a drinking problem.

26:36.013 --> 26:38.265
Hmm.

26:38.265 --> 26:40.017
And then there's this guy
at school and we've had

26:40.017 --> 26:44.646
this whole "will they,
won't they" thing forever.

26:44.646 --> 26:46.982
Just when I thought we might...

26:49.776 --> 26:52.279
Long story short, still single.

26:58.577 --> 27:00.454
Well, I'm sure
someone will come along.

27:00.454 --> 27:02.414
You're sweet,

27:02.414 --> 27:04.458
but I don't need your sympathy.

27:05.542 --> 27:07.461
Hope does, however.

27:07.461 --> 27:09.588
She's fiery, you know?

27:09.588 --> 27:11.632
You'd totally
balance her out.

27:11.632 --> 27:14.468
So if you're free on Friday,

27:14.468 --> 27:18.388
I might be able to set something
up for you.

27:21.934 --> 27:23.602
It's getting pretty late.

27:23.602 --> 27:26.688
We should probably head back
before you fumble again.

27:26.688 --> 27:28.106
Come on.

27:29.691 --> 27:31.777
Hope, wait. Let me explain.

27:31.777 --> 27:33.862
Why? If it's anything
I've learned today,

27:33.862 --> 27:35.405
it's not gonna change anything.

27:35.405 --> 27:37.449
I believe it will.
And even if I'm wrong,

27:37.449 --> 27:39.368
I'd like you to understand
why I did the things

27:39.368 --> 27:41.245
I've done that may have
caused you any pain.

27:41.245 --> 27:43.455
Well, you tried to kill me,
and now you're shacking up

27:43.455 --> 27:45.874
with my ex-boyfriend,
so yes, Cleo, there's pain.

27:45.874 --> 27:48.293
I know. And I am truly sorry.

27:48.293 --> 27:51.839
Looking back, I now see how the
drastic measures I took to try

27:51.839 --> 27:55.884
and put an end to Malivore
had unintended consequences.

27:55.884 --> 27:57.845
Not just for me
but for the people

27:57.845 --> 27:59.847
I've come to regard as friends.

27:59.847 --> 28:01.807
Especially you, Hope.

28:01.807 --> 28:03.642
More than anyone,
you understand as I do

28:03.642 --> 28:04.935
what it means
to bear the burden

28:04.935 --> 28:08.480
of a destiny you cannot escape.

28:08.480 --> 28:10.357
And a fate you must face alone.

28:11.608 --> 28:15.237
Everyone keeps telling me
I'm not gonna have to.

28:15.237 --> 28:16.864
But I'm not sure I believe that.

28:16.864 --> 28:18.532
As for Landon,

28:18.532 --> 28:20.951
all he and I have ever shared
is our mission.

28:20.951 --> 28:22.953
I swear it on the blood
of my ancestors.

28:24.121 --> 28:25.956
It's none of my business.

28:25.956 --> 28:29.209
But in case you're
lying to me again,

28:29.209 --> 28:30.919
you should know
I still love him.

28:30.919 --> 28:32.838
And I want him
to be happy.

28:32.838 --> 28:35.382
Even if it's not with me.

28:35.382 --> 28:37.718
Then you should tell him that.

28:39.970 --> 28:41.930
Hope, one last thing.

28:41.930 --> 28:44.808
When this is finally over
and Malivore has been destroyed,

28:44.808 --> 28:49.062
I... I really hope you and I
will become friends again.

29:00.574 --> 29:02.659
Landon?

29:09.458 --> 29:11.543
Clarke?

29:18.592 --> 29:20.761
No, don't try to talk,
it's making it worse.

29:20.761 --> 29:22.221
I have a way
that I can heal you.

29:27.726 --> 29:30.103
Don't fight me on this.
My blood can save you.

29:31.522 --> 29:34.107
Unless it's toxic
to your Malivore DNA.

29:34.107 --> 29:35.859
You'd be sent back
to the darkness.

29:35.859 --> 29:37.903
Is that a risk
that you're willing to take?

29:40.072 --> 29:41.281
I have another way
I can heal you, but

29:41.281 --> 29:42.699
I'm warning you,
it's gonna suck.

29:42.699 --> 29:43.992
Incendia.

29:47.704 --> 29:49.915
You still got it.
Thanks.

29:49.915 --> 29:51.500
And you should get to thinking
about how you intend

29:51.500 --> 29:53.418
to ask out Hope.

29:53.418 --> 29:55.963
Well, last I heard,
she has a boyfriend.

29:55.963 --> 29:57.381
Who's out of the picture now.

29:57.381 --> 29:59.508
And in the spirit
of keeping it that way,

29:59.508 --> 30:01.385
what about that date?

30:03.178 --> 30:06.640
Listen, Lizzie, I-I think you're
an amazing wingwoman, but...

30:07.891 --> 30:09.309
...if I'm being honest,

30:09.309 --> 30:12.396
I'm kind of into someone else.

30:12.396 --> 30:15.816
Why didn't you mention that
before now?

30:15.816 --> 30:17.818
'Cause I didn't know.

30:17.818 --> 30:19.570
Whatever.

30:19.570 --> 30:21.822
You know what? Whoever she is,

30:21.822 --> 30:24.867
she does not hold a candle
to Hope Mikaelson.

30:25.826 --> 30:28.745
Come on, tell me her name
and I'll prove it.

30:31.081 --> 30:33.000
What are you doing?

30:33.000 --> 30:34.126
Stealing a car.

30:34.126 --> 30:35.377
Don't tell me theft

30:35.377 --> 30:36.378
is suddenly a
problem for you.

30:36.378 --> 30:37.629
We have to go now.

30:37.629 --> 30:39.631
Go where?
Did you speak with Hope?

30:39.631 --> 30:42.259
I don't need her,
thanks to your inspiration.

30:43.302 --> 30:44.553
I thought we were partners.

30:44.553 --> 30:46.722
So my needs
should matter, too.

30:46.722 --> 30:48.640
What idea did I inspire in you?

30:48.640 --> 30:50.601
Could you just
get in the car?

30:52.769 --> 30:54.771
I'll explain on the way.

30:56.064 --> 30:58.233
I thought you trusted me.

30:58.233 --> 30:59.693
And I did.

30:59.693 --> 31:01.653
But until you tell me
your intentions,

31:01.653 --> 31:04.364
I am not going
anywhere with you.

31:06.158 --> 31:10.871
You know, I was really hoping
it wouldn't come to this.

31:16.793 --> 31:19.296
I wasn't gonna make it.

31:19.296 --> 31:22.299
Then these two guys
with masks showed up.

31:22.299 --> 31:24.551
Never got a chance
to thank 'em.

31:24.551 --> 31:27.971
♪ Wild, wild, wild,
wild, wild, wild... ♪

31:28.972 --> 31:31.683
Man, first of all,
these are dope.

31:31.683 --> 31:34.144
And second, everybody's safe.

31:34.144 --> 31:36.313
And so are
our secret identities.

31:36.313 --> 31:38.398
And now

31:38.398 --> 31:40.734
all we got to do is figure out
our superhero ones.

31:40.734 --> 31:42.444
Second order of business

31:42.444 --> 31:45.489

31:48.784 --> 31:52.788
Hold up, weren't you
supposed to talk to somebody?

31:53.789 --> 31:55.916
Not that I can recall.

32:07.970 --> 32:10.597
Landon? You all right?

32:15.435 --> 32:17.229
Oh, God.

32:17.229 --> 32:18.272
Close enough.

32:18.272 --> 32:19.398
Your turn.

32:26.238 --> 32:28.448
Dr. Saltzman.
What are you doing to him?

32:28.448 --> 32:30.367
That is not Landon, Hope.

32:34.288 --> 32:35.831
Where's Cleo?

32:35.831 --> 32:37.207
Who's Cleo?

32:39.001 --> 32:40.836
You're right. It's not Landon.

32:43.046 --> 32:45.674
It's Malivore.

33:10.199 --> 33:12.117
How are you feeling?

33:12.117 --> 33:13.535
Sore.

33:13.535 --> 33:15.245
And surprised,

33:15.245 --> 33:17.497
'cause you clearly saved
my life.

33:17.497 --> 33:19.499
Oh, God. What,

33:19.499 --> 33:20.667
does this make us friends?

33:20.667 --> 33:23.045
Hmm, frenemies at best.

33:26.256 --> 33:28.717
Well, being a human sucks.

33:30.093 --> 33:31.720
But it sure beats
the alternative.

33:31.720 --> 33:33.805
Just wait till you get
the hospital bill.

33:35.057 --> 33:37.809
Still, uh, I owe you one.

33:37.809 --> 33:40.103
So, FYI,

33:40.103 --> 33:41.980
it wasn't your ex who gave me

33:41.980 --> 33:44.316
what I'm hoping will be
a sexy scar.

33:44.316 --> 33:47.361
Landon isn't
who you think he is, Hope.

33:47.361 --> 33:49.112
Literally.
Yeah, I know.

33:49.112 --> 33:50.781
I would have known sooner

33:50.781 --> 33:55.410
if I had just allowed myself
to see it, but...

33:55.410 --> 33:57.955
Instead, I let him
convince me that it was

33:57.955 --> 33:59.540
his struggle to survive
in the prison world

33:59.540 --> 34:01.250
that changed him from the person

34:01.250 --> 34:04.503
that I know better
than just about anyone.

34:04.503 --> 34:08.131
Malivore finally got
what he wanted.

34:08.131 --> 34:11.927
His vessel. He's been hiding
in plain sight ever since.

34:11.927 --> 34:14.721
I told you
he was up to something big.

34:15.681 --> 34:18.016
Destiny, huh?

34:18.016 --> 34:21.103
Maybe you were right.
There's no fighting it.

34:21.103 --> 34:23.856
I don't know.
I was thinking the opposite.

34:23.856 --> 34:27.985
Thanks to you,
as crazy as that sounds.

34:27.985 --> 34:31.989
Against all odds,
you escaped the darkness,

34:31.989 --> 34:33.365
beat your fate.

34:33.365 --> 34:35.742
More importantly,
you did it yourself.

34:35.742 --> 34:37.619
Alone.

34:37.619 --> 34:39.371
That's exactly
what I'm gonna have to do

34:39.371 --> 34:40.956
when it's time to face mine.

34:41.957 --> 34:44.459
But I didn't do it alone.

34:44.459 --> 34:47.921
I-I needed help
to get out of the darkness.

34:47.921 --> 34:51.216
Just like you're going
to need help against Malivore.

34:52.217 --> 34:54.761
So, while I get why you
feel like being the Tribrid

34:54.761 --> 34:57.222
is your own burden to bear,

34:57.222 --> 34:59.975
don't lose sight
of what's in your corner.

34:59.975 --> 35:02.227
The thing I've never had.

35:02.227 --> 35:03.729
What's that?

35:03.729 --> 35:06.106

Figured I'd make
myself scarce

35:36.553 --> 35:40.474
to avoid another close encounter
of the non-supernatural kind.

35:40.474 --> 35:44.853
So, you're not mad at me?

35:44.853 --> 35:47.231

36:19.054 --> 36:22.224

Ethan's football career.

36:22.224 --> 36:24.017
And then this year,

36:24.017 --> 36:28.230
MG had to compel Ethan to forget
the supernatural world,

36:28.230 --> 36:30.440
and it cost him
their friendship.

36:30.440 --> 36:32.150

36:55.048 --> 36:58.594

37:25.370 --> 37:28.248
Ethan asked me out.

No. No.

is just too high,

we were pretty dang super today.

37:47.518 --> 37:48.936
Truer words, my dude.

37:50.771 --> 37:52.898
Hey.
Hey, guys.

less so.

37:58.028 --> 38:00.739

No. No, we've lost
another student today.

What?

38:07.162 --> 38:08.372
Who was it?

38:08.372 --> 38:10.916
Someone you no longer remember.

38:10.916 --> 38:14.837
I didn't, either,
until Hope filled me in.

38:14.837 --> 38:17.798
Malivore strikes again.

38:17.798 --> 38:20.509
Trust me, I'll get to him
in a minute. But right now,

38:20.509 --> 38:22.511
this person meant
a lot to you, Kaleb.

38:22.511 --> 38:24.471
And remembering her is

38:24.471 --> 38:25.931
gonna hurt,

38:25.931 --> 38:29.768
so I just wanted
to give you the option.

38:34.022 --> 38:36.316
I mean, if she was important,

38:36.316 --> 38:38.694
of course
I want to remember her.

38:40.070 --> 38:42.072
Harae-tamai

38:42.072 --> 38:45.200
Kioku Yomigaerashi-tamae.

38:54.585 --> 38:56.086

38:56.086 --> 38:57.379
Well,

38:57.379 --> 38:59.882
I remember Cleo now,
so yeah.

38:59.882 --> 39:02.176
If only her being devoured
by Malivore

39:02.176 --> 39:03.635
could have been avoided.

39:03.635 --> 39:06.263
I'm sorry. To her and to you.

39:06.263 --> 39:08.265
Why did you ditch us?

39:08.265 --> 39:10.893
Especially since
we've been over this.

39:10.893 --> 39:14.438
Did our saving the galaxy
together mean nothing to you?

39:14.438 --> 39:16.982
Actually, it meant everything.

39:16.982 --> 39:19.693
It took Clarke, of all people,
to really make it set in,

39:19.693 --> 39:22.029
but I promise
I won't do it again.

39:23.030 --> 39:25.407

39:26.408 --> 39:28.869
Panda promise.
