00:37.867 --> 00:39.127

them up for all this.

Well, look who's
bringing sexy back.

00:40.765 --> 00:42.648

01:02.820 --> 01:05.087
You graduated
at the top of your class.

01:05.089 --> 01:07.189
You spent ten years
on the floor

01:07.191 --> 01:09.658
at Kings General, and you
are a world-class mom.

01:09.660 --> 01:11.193

Some pedestrian's photo
of one of my officers

03:24.795 --> 03:28.431
behind the wheel
of his RMP... texting.

03:28.433 --> 03:31.600
No, I don't want

to pull them out of bars.

03:40.477 --> 03:42.644

03:42.646 --> 03:45.748

this morning

03:47.835 --> 03:49.452
in the church's

03:49.454 --> 03:52.121
One of our parishioners
gave me some unsettling news.

03:52.123 --> 03:53.506
- This is turkey, right?
- Yeah.

03:53.508 --> 03:54.890
It's dark meat?

03:54.892 --> 03:56.826
I said it was for you.

03:56.828 --> 03:59.962
I don't even want to
talk about it out loud

03:59.964 --> 04:02.198
because it might
make it come true.

04:03.600 --> 04:06.869
She heard that
Father McMurray is leaving.

04:09.772 --> 04:11.373
Has he got some kind
of health issue?

04:11.375 --> 04:12.975
Nah.

04:12.977 --> 04:15.511
Lucy's pretty plugged
in to St. Luke's.

04:15.513 --> 04:18.314
She said they're
transferring him

04:18.315 --> 04:19.548
to Bolivia.

04:19.550 --> 04:21.016
Well, that doesn't

You couldn't have stopped her

What happened?

07:17.540 --> 07:18.906
We don't know.

07:18.908 --> 07:20.708

07:20.710 --> 07:22.844
Is she going to
be all right?

07:22.846 --> 07:24.011
Well, they're stabilizing her

07:24.013 --> 07:25.980
until they can figure out
what happened.

07:26.982 --> 07:29.650
Um, this is Atlanta.

07:29.652 --> 07:32.353
She's been
a big sister to Sofie

07:32.355 --> 07:34.188
since the beginning.
Atlanta, this is

07:34.190 --> 07:35.723

07:35.725 --> 07:38.025
my niece, my
little sister...

07:38.027 --> 07:40.528
Mrs. Lightner, can I
talk to you for a moment?

07:40.530 --> 07:41.963

They're family.

07:41.965 --> 07:43.765

a foreign substance

07:47.804 --> 07:49.437
believed
to be a poisonous mushroom

07:49.439 --> 07:51.005
called <i>Amanita phalloides.</i>

07:51.007 --> 07:52.907
A mushroom?

07:52.909 --> 07:54.275
The death cap.

07:54.277 --> 07:56.877
It's one of the most poisonous
mushrooms in the world.

07:58.547 --> 08:00.214
Science class.

08:00.216 --> 08:02.049
Someone poisoned Sofie?

08:02.051 --> 08:04.752
Well, we don't know how
she came to ingest the mushroom,

08:04.754 --> 08:06.821
but the good news is,
now we know that,

08:06.823 --> 08:08.656
we can focus
on restoring her liver function.

08:08.658 --> 08:10.858
Unfortunately,
we're too late

08:10.860 --> 08:13.928
for the other woman
who ingested a larger amount.

08:14.930 --> 08:16.330
Who would do such a thing?

08:16.332 --> 08:19.167
Well, that's what the police
are going to have to find out.

08:35.384 --> 08:37.784
Bless me Father,
for I have sinned.

08:37.787 --> 08:40.587
I has been two weeks
since my last confession.

08:41.857 --> 08:43.825
These are my sins.

08:43.827 --> 08:45.760
I lost my temper
at Sunday dinner,

08:45.762 --> 08:48.429
and swore in front
of my grandchildren.

08:48.431 --> 08:50.898
I was angry at my son.

08:50.900 --> 08:52.233
Danny?

08:52.235 --> 08:53.768
Exactly.

08:53.770 --> 08:55.102
What did you say?

08:55.104 --> 08:57.071
The big one.

08:57.073 --> 08:58.806
I see.

08:58.808 --> 09:00.875
The temper, Frank--
we've talked about that.

09:00.877 --> 09:02.476
I know that, Father.

09:02.478 --> 09:05.413
All right, say two Our Fathers,
five Hail Marys

09:05.415 --> 09:06.981
and a good Act
of Contrition.

09:06.983 --> 09:08.649
Thank you, Father.

09:08.651 --> 09:13.187
So, it took you two weeks
to stir up one sin?

09:17.225 --> 09:19.527
I heard you're leaving
St. Luke's.

09:19.529 --> 09:22.029
So much for keeping
the transfer quiet.

09:25.567 --> 09:27.435
Is this something
you really want?

09:27.437 --> 09:30.438
I've had a good run
at St. Luke's, Frank.

09:30.440 --> 09:33.641
Bolivia will be
an invigorating new challenge.

09:33.643 --> 09:36.210
Father...

09:36.212 --> 09:38.145
is there anything

09:38.147 --> 09:40.348
I can say
that will change your mind?

09:40.350 --> 09:42.483
I'm a parish priest, Frank.

09:42.485 --> 09:44.318
I go where I'm asked.

09:52.895 --> 09:54.629
These mushrooms
that poisoned your friend--

09:54.631 --> 09:57.765
they usually take 12 to 20 hours
to have this kind of effect,

09:57.767 --> 09:59.934
so it's important
that we track the whereabouts

09:59.936 --> 10:01.702
of Milli and Sofie
during that time period.

10:01.704 --> 10:04.338
And Sofie's mother told us
that Sofie was at some party

10:04.340 --> 10:05.907
last night at
Milli Skye's loft.

10:05.909 --> 10:07.341
We all were.

10:07.343 --> 10:09.577
It was her annual kickoff party
for Fashion Week.

10:09.579 --> 10:10.878
Okay, was there anyone
at that party

10:10.880 --> 10:12.813
that you know of
would want to hurt your friend?

10:12.815 --> 10:14.882
Sofie? Absolutely not.

10:14.884 --> 10:16.984
She's the sweetest girl
in the world.

10:16.986 --> 10:19.320
Besides, she hasn't even been
in this business

10:19.322 --> 10:21.155
long enough to
make any enemies.

10:21.157 --> 10:22.290
Okay, what about Milli?

10:22.292 --> 10:23.791
Is there anyone
who would want to hurt her?

10:23.793 --> 10:25.393
Everybody.

10:25.395 --> 10:27.128
- Everybody?
- Atlanta!

10:27.130 --> 10:28.529
- Oh, my God.
- Harry.

10:28.531 --> 10:30.047
What's going on?
Where is she?

10:30.049 --> 10:32.133
Sofie's on a respirator
and dialysis. It's horrible.

10:32.135 --> 10:34.368
And she's got swelling
on her brain.

10:34.370 --> 10:35.836
Does Dorian know?

10:35.838 --> 10:36.704
Who's Dorian?

10:36.706 --> 10:38.873
It's Sofie's
new boyfriend.

10:38.875 --> 10:40.174
And who is this?

10:40.176 --> 10:41.709
Oh, this is Harry.
He's my best friend,

10:41.711 --> 10:42.843
and Sofie's hairdresser.

10:42.845 --> 10:43.945
Hi.

10:43.947 --> 10:45.479
These are the
detectives.

10:45.481 --> 10:47.048
They were just wondering

10:47.050 --> 10:49.383
if there was anybody
at the party last night

10:49.385 --> 10:51.285
who would want to
see Milli dead.

10:51.287 --> 10:52.887
Everybody.

10:55.190 --> 10:58.059
Okay.

10:59.494 --> 11:01.579
Yeah, Reagan,
I don't know.

11:01.581 --> 11:03.564
I don't know anything about,
you know,

11:03.566 --> 11:05.866
fashion models
and-and poisonous mushrooms.

11:05.868 --> 11:08.703
I don't, either, but I'm doing
it for my wife, for her sister.

11:08.705 --> 11:11.422
Oh, the sister I don't hear
anything nice about.

11:11.424 --> 11:13.040
And you never will hear
anything good about her,

11:13.042 --> 11:14.542
but unfortunately,
her daughter's in a coma,

11:14.544 --> 11:16.711
'cause someone tried to kill
her, and they did kill Milli.

11:16.713 --> 11:18.929
All right, okay.

11:18.931 --> 11:21.115
<i>Thank you for seeing me,
Father.</i>

11:22.117 --> 11:23.300
I called you Father.

11:23.302 --> 11:26.320
Old habits die hard,
Your Excellency.

11:26.322 --> 11:28.456
Well, it's never too soon
to start talking

11:28.458 --> 11:32.093
about security
for the Pope's visit next year.

11:32.095 --> 11:35.096
What are you really doing here,
Francis?

11:36.098 --> 11:38.098
You always could see through me.

11:39.100 --> 11:40.835
Well, it goes with the miter.

11:41.837 --> 11:43.004
Well...

11:45.140 --> 11:47.842
I'm not here
as the police commissioner.

11:47.844 --> 11:49.343
I'm here as a parishioner.

11:49.345 --> 11:51.912
You want to know why I'm
transferring Father McMurray out.

11:51.914 --> 11:53.514
I do.

11:53.516 --> 11:56.017
The Reagan family has
a strong bond with the Father.

11:56.019 --> 11:59.653
These are hard times
for the church, Francis.

11:59.655 --> 12:03.624
I've had to close six schools
in our diocese,

12:03.626 --> 12:05.559
even our own St. Brendan's.

12:05.561 --> 12:06.894
A sad day.

12:06.896 --> 12:10.531
I got a good education there,
so did my children.

12:10.533 --> 12:13.534
Have you spoken with
Father McMurray?

12:13.536 --> 12:15.202
I have. He said nothing

12:15.204 --> 12:17.872
that would indicate
he had a problem with the move.

12:17.874 --> 12:19.306
Well...?

12:19.308 --> 12:21.809
Well,

12:21.811 --> 12:24.545
I'm a cop, Your Excellency.

12:24.547 --> 12:28.049
It's really more
about what he didn't say.

12:28.051 --> 12:29.717
Something's wrong.

12:29.719 --> 12:32.553
A woman has accused
Father McMurray

12:32.555 --> 12:37.158
of inappropriate behavior...
of a sexual nature.

12:42.764 --> 12:44.732
Does she have any proof?

12:44.734 --> 12:48.135
In the current climate,
proof is not necessary.

12:48.137 --> 12:50.571
Francis, you came
to me a while back

12:50.573 --> 12:53.641
and reminded me that
the church can no longer afford

12:53.643 --> 12:56.010
to sweep things under the rug.

12:56.012 --> 12:59.046
The woman is demanding
he be removed from St. Luke's.

12:59.048 --> 13:01.415
We're facing
the issue head-on.

13:01.417 --> 13:04.652
This man buried my wife
and my son.

13:04.654 --> 13:05.986
He baptized Jamie.

13:05.988 --> 13:08.756
Father McMurray is a good man.

13:08.758 --> 13:12.026
What this woman is saying

13:12.028 --> 13:14.195
is not possible.

13:17.199 --> 13:20.701
It is just as important
to exonerate an innocent person

13:20.703 --> 13:22.636
as it is
to convict a guilty one.

13:22.638 --> 13:27.108
That's what they teach us
at the Academy from day one.

13:27.110 --> 13:29.210
I know you share this belief.

13:32.949 --> 13:35.116
Father...

13:36.118 --> 13:37.518
in so many ways,

13:37.520 --> 13:40.321
I will always be the student,
and you the mentor,

13:40.323 --> 13:43.190
so this is not easy
for me to say,

13:43.192 --> 13:46.026
but you are not facing
this problem head-on.

13:46.028 --> 13:49.396
This is just another way of
sweeping things under the rug.

13:49.398 --> 13:52.166
To ignore
this woman's accusation

13:52.168 --> 13:54.835
would bring tremendous
negative attention,

13:55.837 --> 13:58.472
which the church can ill afford.

13:58.474 --> 14:01.876
Father McMurray leaves
at the end of the month.

14:08.683 --> 14:10.434
Okay. Yes. Whatever.

14:10.436 --> 14:12.753
What's up, Jack?

14:12.755 --> 14:16.273
Um, the mushroom samples have
been sent to the DEA lab in D.C.

14:16.275 --> 14:19.310
It seems that they can
figure out exactly what country

14:19.312 --> 14:20.995
these death caps came from.

14:20.997 --> 14:22.897
Great. When we found out where,
we'll take a look,

14:22.899 --> 14:24.498
see who went there and when.
What else?

14:24.500 --> 14:25.900
Yeah. Well, our lab is going
over everything

14:25.902 --> 14:27.284
they found backstage
at the fashion show.

14:27.286 --> 14:30.204
Well, Timeline-wise,
Milli's party is the best bet.

14:30.206 --> 14:32.339
Well, that's good news
and bad news.

14:32.341 --> 14:33.574
Bad news first.

14:33.576 --> 14:35.009
Well, the bad news is,

14:35.011 --> 14:36.377
the loft was completely
cleaned out,

14:36.379 --> 14:38.779
and the caterers
got rid of all the old food.

14:38.781 --> 14:40.080
Anybody getting
the caterer's story?

14:40.082 --> 14:41.632
- Yeah, as we speak.
- All right, how about the good news?

14:41.634 --> 14:43.717
Good news is,
while you were downstairs,

14:43.719 --> 14:46.136
this came
from Milli Skye's network.

14:46.138 --> 14:48.505
It seems that she had
a camera crew recording

14:48.507 --> 14:50.991
all six plus hours of the party

14:50.993 --> 14:52.526
for Milli's reality show.

14:52.528 --> 14:54.728
That is every minute
of her every move.

14:54.730 --> 14:57.231
Well, maybe we'll get lucky,
catch a killer in the act.

14:57.233 --> 14:59.433
Worst case, we get to see
how the beautiful people party.

14:59.435 --> 15:01.068
There's a young lady
here to see you

15:01.070 --> 15:02.519
about the Milli Skye case.

15:02.521 --> 15:03.737
Are you Detective Reagan?

15:03.739 --> 15:05.573
Yeah. This is my partner

15:05.575 --> 15:06.640
Detective Curatola.

15:06.642 --> 15:08.409
- You are?
- Cameron Swanson.

15:08.411 --> 15:10.077
I was Milli Skye's
personal assistant.

15:10.079 --> 15:11.745
Mind taking off your sunglasses?

15:15.317 --> 15:16.817
Mm-hmm.

15:16.819 --> 15:19.053
I knew you'd catch me anyway.

15:19.055 --> 15:21.655
I'm here to report a crime.

15:23.353 --> 15:24.887
Kill Milli? Me?

15:25.654 --> 15:27.988
I stole from her,
that is all, and

15:27.990 --> 15:30.690
I didn't really steal from her
because that money was mine.

15:30.872 --> 15:33.339
Let's say you were
stealing and that's all.

15:35.328 --> 15:37.897
Why don't you take us back to
the beginning of you and Milli?

15:38.146 --> 15:40.579
That morning...
the morning of the party,

15:40.581 --> 15:42.748
they didn't have any
lactose-free for her latte,

15:42.750 --> 15:46.385
so I used soy milk,
and she starts

15:46.387 --> 15:47.720
screaming at me.

15:47.722 --> 15:50.156
I told her I was quitting,
and I wanted my money,

15:50.158 --> 15:51.524
but she didn't give it to me,

15:51.526 --> 15:53.559
so I tried to leave,
and she said I couldn't

15:53.561 --> 15:54.994
because she needed me
for the party,

15:54.996 --> 15:56.896
and when I tried to go,

15:56.898 --> 15:58.664
she took her cell phone

15:58.666 --> 16:00.399
and smashed it into my face.

16:00.401 --> 16:01.867
The black eye.

16:01.869 --> 16:03.719
I just wanted my $1,200.

16:04.721 --> 16:07.306
I knew she'd be distracted
during the party, so I snuck in.

16:07.308 --> 16:08.974
I knew where she kept the cash.

16:08.976 --> 16:11.410
I have it here,
and I can give it back.

16:11.412 --> 16:12.728
No, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait.

16:12.730 --> 16:14.747
If you quit,
then why were you with Milli

16:14.749 --> 16:16.348
the next day
at the fashion show?

16:17.350 --> 16:20.119
She said she'd tell my parents
I'm bulimic.

16:24.157 --> 16:26.358
All right.

16:26.360 --> 16:27.493
Suppose we believe you.

16:27.495 --> 16:29.862
Suppose you're telling
the truth.

16:29.864 --> 16:33.199
Is there anything
you saw at the party

16:33.201 --> 16:35.935
that would help us find out
who killed Milli?

16:35.937 --> 16:38.604
Anything you know,
anybody acting suspicious?

16:38.606 --> 16:40.706
Tampering with the food
in the kitchen? Anything?

16:40.708 --> 16:44.110
Well, Sofie's new boyfriend,
Dorian...

16:44.112 --> 16:46.746
Baby rock star Dorian?
What does he have to do with it?

16:46.748 --> 16:50.816
I saw him... saw him shaving
something onto Sofie's risotto.

16:50.818 --> 16:52.885
Sofie's risotto?

16:52.887 --> 16:54.053
Not Milli's?

16:54.055 --> 16:57.423
I don't know. I told you
I was only there for a second.

16:57.425 --> 16:58.607
I didn't see much,

16:59.609 --> 17:02.061
but I saw that.

17:02.063 --> 17:03.612
Sit tight for a second.

17:08.435 --> 17:09.969
I don't know.

17:09.971 --> 17:12.137
Maybe we have been looking
at the wrong vic.

17:12.140 --> 17:14.673
I mean, maybe Sofie was the
target, Milli was collateral.

17:14.675 --> 17:16.809
Who would want to kill Sofie
and why?

17:16.810 --> 17:18.544
I don't know.
I mean, boyfriend's

17:18.546 --> 17:20.546
as good a place as any to start.

17:20.548 --> 17:22.580
What about her?

17:22.583 --> 17:24.483
Well, Milli's not exactly around
to press charges.

17:24.484 --> 17:25.684
Knowing my track record

17:25.685 --> 17:27.887
with a certain someone
at the D.A.'s office,

17:27.888 --> 17:30.623
- they probably cut her loose anyway.
- Yeah.

17:58.851 --> 17:59.852
Hey.

18:00.854 --> 18:01.871
Look at this guy.

18:01.873 --> 18:04.540
We got a sector to patrol,
and you're playing Facebook?

18:04.542 --> 18:05.958
No. It's just, uh...

18:06.960 --> 18:08.043
Everything all right?

18:08.045 --> 18:09.762
Oh, yeah, yeah.

18:09.764 --> 18:10.930
Yeah.

18:10.932 --> 18:12.431
So go, uh,
inventory your RMP.

18:12.433 --> 18:14.066
I'll meet you
in the lot.

18:14.068 --> 18:16.335
You got it, Sarge.
All right.

18:43.413 --> 18:45.598
Hello, Frank.

18:47.701 --> 18:49.301
Didn't mean to
disturb you, Father.

18:49.303 --> 18:50.536
Oh, not at all.

18:50.538 --> 18:52.738
Back for another run
at the booth so soon?

18:52.740 --> 18:54.373
I need to talk to you.

18:54.375 --> 18:56.742
Please sit.

19:06.237 --> 19:09.855
I went to see Bishop Donovan.

19:13.093 --> 19:16.295
The woman was a member
of the parish years ago.

19:17.464 --> 19:18.898
She didn't have an easy life.

19:19.900 --> 19:21.600
She imagined
she was in love with me.

19:21.602 --> 19:24.937
We're taught
to expect this as priests.

19:26.506 --> 19:28.574
There were letters

19:28.576 --> 19:30.209
and gifts.

19:30.211 --> 19:32.411
And she finally made
a physical advance,

19:32.413 --> 19:34.513
which I, of course,
gently deflected.

19:34.515 --> 19:36.615
And I thought
that was the end of it.

19:37.617 --> 19:39.785
And it was.

19:39.787 --> 19:41.987
But after a failed marriage,

19:41.989 --> 19:44.857
she moved back
into her parents' house

19:44.859 --> 19:47.059
and to the parish.

19:48.461 --> 19:51.697
I think she feels shame
in herself at the sight of me.

19:52.699 --> 19:55.367
Have you told this
to Bishop Donovan?

19:55.369 --> 19:58.904
The Bishop is between a rock
and a hard place.

20:00.273 --> 20:03.275
The woman is imbalanced, Frank.

20:03.277 --> 20:05.811
She has a history
of psychiatric illness.

20:05.813 --> 20:09.048
But if we defend ourselves
by revealing this,

20:10.050 --> 20:12.418
it will only bring up
the church's recent history

20:12.420 --> 20:17.022
of having turned a blind eye
to legitimate claims of abuse.

20:17.024 --> 20:19.525
This isn't right.

20:20.961 --> 20:23.996
And you falling on your sword
isn't the answer.

20:23.998 --> 20:26.432
Oh, I'm not a martyr.

20:26.434 --> 20:29.735
The Church has plenty
of real ones.

20:38.678 --> 20:41.180
I'm at peace, Frank.

20:45.318 --> 20:49.054
I wish the Reagan family
could say the same.

20:50.457 --> 20:52.925
Eh, it's like a nest
of vipers, bunch of phonies.

20:52.927 --> 20:54.460
It's amazing.

20:54.462 --> 20:56.461
They all hated Milli Skye,
yet they're all at her party.

20:56.463 --> 20:57.663
Typical.

20:57.848 --> 20:59.598
There's Milli.

21:02.335 --> 21:04.737
Okay, this is Sofie right
here. That's my niece.

21:04.739 --> 21:05.971
She's a pretty girl.

21:05.973 --> 21:07.840
What's that?

21:07.842 --> 21:10.526
That's her boyfriend, Dorian.

21:10.528 --> 21:11.710
He's a guy?

21:11.712 --> 21:12.911
Yeah, that's a guy.

21:12.913 --> 21:15.781
He's a musician.
He's a big, famous dude.

21:15.783 --> 21:16.815
Famous with who?

21:16.817 --> 21:18.517
With kids. You know,
young girls.

21:18.519 --> 21:20.786
He's this new wave, new punk.

21:20.788 --> 21:22.687
And you know this because?

21:22.689 --> 21:25.040
Stupid magazines
at the hair salon.

21:26.993 --> 21:28.410
Hold on. Pause that.

21:28.412 --> 21:30.462
What is he doing there?

21:30.464 --> 21:32.364
The girl with the black eye--
she said

21:32.366 --> 21:33.732
he put something on top
of Sofie's food.

21:33.734 --> 21:34.900
Well, he's doing it right there.

21:34.902 --> 21:36.235
Right. What is that?

21:36.237 --> 21:37.970
It's like a mushroom
or something.

21:37.972 --> 21:40.005
It's not Parmesan cheese,
I'll tell you that much.

21:40.007 --> 21:42.141
Look. Look.
Look at the frame in the back.

21:42.143 --> 21:44.543
It's Milli's assistant
with the dark glasses.

21:44.545 --> 21:47.312
Well, she said she saw him
put it on there, so...

21:47.314 --> 21:49.648
All right,
let's keep watching.

21:57.991 --> 21:59.558
Nope. Look at this.

21:59.560 --> 22:01.460
Milli didn't even get
any of that stuff.

22:01.462 --> 22:03.362
No.

22:09.035 --> 22:10.586
Keep watching.

22:13.940 --> 22:15.624
Look, at that.

22:15.626 --> 22:17.259
Milli took Sofie's plate.

22:17.261 --> 22:19.211
There. Milli got some.

22:19.213 --> 22:20.879
Just maybe
wasn't by design.

22:20.881 --> 22:23.415
Yeah, looks like she got a lot
more than she bargained for.

22:23.417 --> 22:24.616
Yeah, like being dead.

22:24.618 --> 22:27.352
Let's go snatch up
this Dorian kid.

22:27.354 --> 22:28.720
Yep.

22:28.722 --> 22:31.523
♪
♪

22:31.525 --> 22:33.358
♪ What shines
when the eyes are dull? ♪

22:33.360 --> 22:36.361
♪ What folds
when the hinge is gone? ♪

22:36.363 --> 22:38.397
♪ The moth is dead
without the dust ♪

22:38.399 --> 22:40.466
Mind if we crash the party?

22:40.468 --> 22:42.201
- Cops!
- Shut up!

22:42.203 --> 22:43.402
Everybody, put your hands
where we can see them.

22:43.404 --> 22:45.654
Kill that music right now!

22:46.774 --> 22:48.457
We're looking for Dorian.

22:48.459 --> 22:49.541
- What's his last name?
- Dorian.

22:49.543 --> 22:50.576
The rock star.

22:53.547 --> 22:55.464
Step aside.

22:55.466 --> 22:57.683
Get over there.

22:57.685 --> 23:00.586
Hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey.

23:00.588 --> 23:02.504
What are you doing
with this, huh?

23:02.506 --> 23:04.089
What are you
doing? Come on.

23:04.091 --> 23:05.557
Come on, rock star.
Come on.

23:05.559 --> 23:06.692
Look what I found.

23:06.694 --> 23:07.759
Mushrooms.

23:07.761 --> 23:08.894
Oh, yeah.

23:11.377 --> 23:13.011
"Everybody in here
is gonna cry.

23:13.013 --> 23:15.446
"Everybody
in here's gonna fry, fry.

23:15.531 --> 23:16.831
"I'm starting
with the beauties

23:16.833 --> 23:18.899
"'cause they're
so bleeping snooty.

23:18.901 --> 23:21.602
"Look at all the models.
Watch them die, die."

23:21.604 --> 23:23.704
And now a model's dead.

23:23.706 --> 23:25.473
It's just a song.

23:25.475 --> 23:27.591
A song about killing models.

23:27.593 --> 23:29.476
How convenient would it be

23:29.478 --> 23:30.945
if your girlfriend, a model,

23:30.947 --> 23:32.997
happened to die right when your
new video was being released?

23:32.999 --> 23:35.116
That would be number
one with a bullet.

23:35.118 --> 23:36.851
You think this is
some kind of joke?

23:36.853 --> 23:40.054
Less than 48 hours
after your girlfriend

23:40.056 --> 23:41.188
slipped into a coma

23:41.190 --> 23:43.157
and some woman died
because somebody gave them

23:43.159 --> 23:44.658
some kind of poisonous mushroom,

23:44.660 --> 23:47.394
you're having a drug-fueled
party and flushing what appears

23:47.396 --> 23:49.330
to be the murder weapon
right down the toilet.

23:49.332 --> 23:51.832
I told you,
they're psychedelic mushrooms.

23:51.834 --> 23:54.501
Well, I got a video
of you shaving something

23:54.503 --> 23:56.771
that sure does look like
a mushroom onto Sofie's risotto

23:56.773 --> 23:57.972
at Milli's party.

23:57.974 --> 23:59.306
What are you talk...

23:59.308 --> 24:01.609
Oh yeah, you mean my truffle?

24:01.611 --> 24:02.810
What?

24:02.812 --> 24:04.278
I'm talking about
a poisonous mushroom.

24:04.280 --> 24:06.363
No, man, it's a truffle I bought

24:06.365 --> 24:07.782
at Mario's charity auction

24:07.784 --> 24:09.583
to feed the needy.
It gives me good cred.

24:09.585 --> 24:11.318
That thing set me
back two grand.

24:11.320 --> 24:12.536
A chocolate truffle?

24:12.538 --> 24:13.771
No, no, man.

24:13.773 --> 24:15.022
Not chocolate.

24:15.024 --> 24:16.490
It's like a...
it's, like, mushroom,

24:16.492 --> 24:17.858
but not a
poisonous mushroom.

24:17.860 --> 24:20.094
Like a... Like a
tuber, I think.

24:20.596 --> 24:21.862
$2,000?

24:21.864 --> 24:24.298
Yeah. They're rare
or something.

24:24.300 --> 24:26.367
Anyway, I didn't
give any to Milli,

24:26.369 --> 24:28.002
and she's the
one that's dead.

24:29.004 --> 24:31.755
Okay. Why don't you tell me
what you did

24:31.757 --> 24:35.426
with the rest of this magical
$2,000 truffle?

24:35.428 --> 24:36.610
It's gone.

24:36.612 --> 24:38.512
I gave it to a lot of
other people at the party.

24:40.264 --> 24:42.449
You got to ask yourself why
they're not dead, too, right?

24:42.451 --> 24:44.718
No, I don't have
to ask myself anything.

24:44.720 --> 24:46.987
But what I do keep
wondering about is why

24:46.989 --> 24:49.607
<i>you</i> haven't asked any questions
about your girlfriend.

24:50.609 --> 24:51.742
I mean, she's in a coma.

24:51.744 --> 24:53.694
You haven't even asked
how she's doing.

24:53.696 --> 24:55.896
I know. I-I'm sorry.

24:55.898 --> 24:57.164
I-I forgot.

24:57.166 --> 24:58.449
Right.

24:58.451 --> 25:00.801
Your girlfriend's dying.
It just slipped your mind.

25:00.803 --> 25:03.003
Yeah. Well, see,
that's the thing.

25:03.005 --> 25:04.305
What's the thing?

25:04.307 --> 25:06.273
She's not really my girlfriend.

25:06.275 --> 25:07.374
She's not your girlfriend?

25:07.376 --> 25:09.343
No. It was like an arrangement.

25:09.345 --> 25:11.011
It was my manager
and her mother.

25:11.013 --> 25:14.348
Wendy thought it would be a good
idea for Sofie's rising star,

25:14.350 --> 25:18.419
the red carpet
and Page Six and like that.

25:18.421 --> 25:19.587
Mm-hmm?

25:19.589 --> 25:22.106
So this arrangement?

25:22.108 --> 25:23.641
What did you get from it?

25:24.643 --> 25:25.993
I'd rather not say.

25:25.995 --> 25:28.095
Really? Okay.

25:28.597 --> 25:30.331
Well, you don't say.

25:30.833 --> 25:34.668
I'll just charge you with
homicide and get on with my day.

25:36.070 --> 25:37.670
Protection.

25:38.672 --> 25:39.906
From what?

25:42.127 --> 25:43.826
Protection from what?

25:43.828 --> 25:45.312
From rumors.

25:45.314 --> 25:46.413
What type of rumors?

25:46.415 --> 25:47.615
The kind that

25:47.617 --> 25:49.216
if a young teenage
girl were to hear,

25:49.218 --> 25:51.185
she would never buy
another Dorian ticket.

25:52.687 --> 25:54.171
Hmm...

25:56.173 --> 25:57.057
Look, the truth is

25:57.059 --> 25:58.876
that I was
a lot more interested

25:58.878 --> 26:01.228
in her friend Harry
than I was in Sofie.

26:04.798 --> 26:05.900
Reagan?
Talk to you?

26:05.902 --> 26:08.102
Yeah.

26:12.741 --> 26:14.808
I just discovered

26:14.810 --> 26:17.444
that Sofie
was Dorian's beard.

26:17.446 --> 26:19.179
Really? Huh.

26:19.181 --> 26:20.547
- Yeah.
- Wow.

26:20.549 --> 26:22.750
Well, one thing the guy's
telling the truth about?

26:22.752 --> 26:24.919
The lab results just came
in on those mushrooms

26:24.921 --> 26:26.420
he was trying to flush
down the toilet bowl.

26:26.422 --> 26:27.538
- Mm-hmm?
- They're psychedelic.

26:27.540 --> 26:29.156
I guess the truffles

26:29.158 --> 26:30.557
weren't poisonous either, then.

26:30.559 --> 26:32.793
I don't know. This
is very confusing.

26:32.795 --> 26:35.296
Well, what we do know
is that somebody tried

26:35.298 --> 26:36.397
to poison someone.

26:36.399 --> 26:38.866
One woman is dead,
and a girl is in a coma.

26:38.868 --> 26:40.200
Let's just hold him
for possession

26:40.202 --> 26:41.835
of a controlled substance
till we figure this thing out.

26:41.837 --> 26:43.203
Yeah.

26:50.945 --> 26:52.112
Morning.

26:52.114 --> 26:55.482
Hey.

26:55.484 --> 26:56.951
Any change?

26:56.953 --> 26:59.119
She's breathing on her own.

27:00.121 --> 27:02.122
The liver chemistry's better.

27:06.661 --> 27:08.595
Wen...

27:08.597 --> 27:10.631
they don't think it
was the musician anymore.

27:10.633 --> 27:12.866
The mushrooms that
they confiscated

27:12.868 --> 27:14.702
were a recreational drug.

27:14.704 --> 27:18.589
Dorian had no reason
to harm Sofie.

27:18.591 --> 27:20.107
They barely knew each other.

27:20.109 --> 27:22.009
I know.

27:24.011 --> 27:25.946
Daniel told you

27:25.948 --> 27:29.183
about the arrangement?

27:30.185 --> 27:31.285
You must think I'm horrible.

27:33.990 --> 27:35.389
It's, um...

27:36.391 --> 27:39.593
It's just hard
for me to understand.

27:40.928 --> 27:43.097
What?

27:43.599 --> 27:46.867
Why I pushed my daughter
to get mixed up in some creepy,

27:46.869 --> 27:49.737
fake relationship
with a drug-addled rock star

27:49.739 --> 27:52.106
in the closet so she could
get her name in the paper?

27:53.108 --> 27:55.442
Get her face on the cover
of some stupid magazine?

27:55.444 --> 27:56.977
You don't think I feel
bad enough already?

27:56.979 --> 27:58.128
I didn't say that.

27:58.130 --> 27:59.580
That's what you were thinking.

27:59.582 --> 28:02.349
Little Miss Staten Island
Salt of the Earth.

28:02.351 --> 28:04.418
- Wendy, please stop.
- You stop!

28:05.420 --> 28:07.921
You blame me because
I wanted a better life.

28:09.423 --> 28:10.357
This is better?

28:10.859 --> 28:11.892
There it is.

28:12.894 --> 28:13.827
The contempt.

28:14.329 --> 28:15.863
I was trying to be
sympathetic, Wen.

28:15.865 --> 28:16.964
Is that so?

28:17.966 --> 28:19.633
Just leave me
and my daughter alone.

28:19.635 --> 28:22.069
- Wen...
- Get out of here!

28:38.087 --> 28:40.421
Well, the woman has a history
of mental problems.

28:40.423 --> 28:42.256
So what's going on?
Why are they kicking him out?

28:42.258 --> 28:43.824
He's a sacrificial lamb.

28:43.826 --> 28:45.025
I'm not following you, Dad.

28:45.027 --> 28:46.794
It'll look like
they're latching on to this

28:46.796 --> 28:48.429
to excuse themselves
for allegations

28:48.431 --> 28:49.496
that they've ignored
in the past.

28:49.498 --> 28:51.231
Oh. Well, thanks, Harvard.

28:52.233 --> 28:53.067
You asked.

28:53.935 --> 28:54.868
That isn't fair.

28:54.870 --> 28:56.070
No it isn't, Nicky.

28:56.072 --> 28:57.304
But it isn't simple, either.

28:58.306 --> 29:00.774
If it goes public,
it hurts the Church.

29:00.776 --> 29:02.443
No kidding.

29:02.445 --> 29:05.746
I'm in the middle of a fund
drive for Comforting Community.

29:05.748 --> 29:08.348
If people get turned off,
if they don't ante up,

29:08.350 --> 29:12.386
what's going to happen to all
those senior citizens we serve?

29:12.388 --> 29:13.754
So what do you think, Dad?

29:13.756 --> 29:16.824
I was kind of hoping
to find out what you guys think.

29:17.826 --> 29:19.493
It's a tough one.

29:20.095 --> 29:21.828
I mean, I can see it
from both sides.

29:21.830 --> 29:22.629
Yeah, me, too.

29:22.631 --> 29:24.832
Lawyers, what do you expect?

29:25.900 --> 29:28.368
Well, I'll take a
side. It stinks.

29:28.370 --> 29:30.504
I'm not talking
about the legality.

29:30.506 --> 29:34.308
It's not a question of due
process, it's an ethical issue.

29:34.310 --> 29:37.111
Yeah. Is the Church making the
Father pay for its former sins?

29:37.113 --> 29:40.080
Yeah. On the other hand, Father
McMurray isn't resisting, right?

29:40.082 --> 29:41.281
Right.

29:41.283 --> 29:42.866
Of course not.
He loves the Church.

29:42.868 --> 29:44.451
He's willing
to make the sacrifice.

29:44.453 --> 29:46.620
Are we being selfish
for not wanting to lose him?

29:46.622 --> 29:48.855
Are we putting our wishes
before the needs of the Church?

29:48.857 --> 29:51.558
That's all well and good.
But somebody should take a side.

29:51.560 --> 29:53.660
He's a good priest.
It stinks.

29:53.662 --> 29:55.963
Well, I think
we should have faith

29:55.965 --> 29:58.365
that Bishop Donovan
will do the right thing.

30:00.367 --> 30:02.369
Everything has a cost,
even the truth.

30:02.371 --> 30:05.739
But the reward
for truth is a clear eye

30:05.741 --> 30:06.840
and a clear conscience.

30:07.842 --> 30:08.108
Who said that?

30:08.110 --> 30:12.045
Bishop Donovan,
when he was at St. Brendan's.

30:12.047 --> 30:13.947
Hmm.

30:16.316 --> 30:18.769
I just hope he remembers it.

30:21.222 --> 30:23.407
Brought you some of Staten
Island's finest, Jackie,

30:23.409 --> 30:24.958
and some fresh jet fuel.

30:24.960 --> 30:26.410
Ooh. Thank you.

30:26.412 --> 30:28.562
Any results
from the DEA in D.C. yet?

30:28.564 --> 30:31.665
Um, yeah. The mushrooms
that killed Milli

30:31.667 --> 30:33.734
and poisoned Sofie,
they came from Morocco.

30:33.736 --> 30:35.035
And they were purchased fresh

30:35.037 --> 30:36.336
and harvested
no more than a month ago.

30:36.338 --> 30:38.956
You got any airplane
manifests from Morocco?

30:38.958 --> 30:41.542
Passenger lists for the last
six weeks just to be safe

30:41.544 --> 30:42.876
from Marrakech and Casablanca.

30:42.878 --> 30:45.579
This is from Iberia Airlines.

30:45.581 --> 30:47.481
Rock the Casbah.

30:47.483 --> 30:49.516
Uh, so far nothing on American.

30:49.518 --> 30:51.285
But I'm checking Air France now.

30:53.753 --> 30:56.440
Newark to Marrakech,
via Paris...

30:56.442 --> 30:59.776
What was that-that hairstylist?
What was it? Harry? Barry?

30:59.778 --> 31:02.496
Harry? Harry Bell?

31:02.498 --> 31:04.431
Harry Bell. Right here.

31:04.433 --> 31:06.633
Seat 30A, three weeks ago.

31:06.635 --> 31:08.835
Harry, that sweet little
hairdresser kid?

31:09.537 --> 31:10.037
Maybe.

31:10.539 --> 31:11.655
Why don't we go
pay him a visit?

31:11.657 --> 31:13.507
We'll check the rest of
the manifests on the way.

31:13.509 --> 31:14.508
Okay.

31:21.715 --> 31:22.382
I hear music.

31:22.384 --> 31:24.518
- Yeah, pretty loud.
- Maybe he's home.

31:24.520 --> 31:25.953
Harry Bell!

31:26.955 --> 31:28.222
Open the door!

31:31.509 --> 31:34.228
Well, you know, the neighbors have
been complaining about loud music.

31:34.230 --> 31:36.513
Right.

31:52.719 --> 31:54.020
Hey, Dorian!
A clean park.

31:55.396 --> 31:57.296
New York City
thanks you.

31:57.298 --> 31:59.464
Oh, no, no, thank you.

31:59.466 --> 32:02.134
I got 99 more hours
of community service to do

32:02.136 --> 32:03.552
for something
that grows in God's earth.

32:03.554 --> 32:05.137
Well, it may grow
in God's earth,

32:05.139 --> 32:06.605
but it's still illegal.

32:06.607 --> 32:08.674
The other day you told us you'd
rather hang out with Harry

32:08.676 --> 32:10.726
than you would with
Sofie, is that right?

32:10.728 --> 32:11.877
Yeah. We had our
moment. Why?

32:11.879 --> 32:13.478
Well,
Harry the hairdresser's dead.

32:13.480 --> 32:15.314
Apparently,
he committed suicide.

32:15.316 --> 32:17.482
Harry's dead?

32:17.484 --> 32:19.685
Yeah, that's what I said.
Now, the problem for us

32:19.687 --> 32:21.720
is Harry had just
become our main suspect.

32:21.722 --> 32:24.956
He was on a plane to Morocco,
where the mushrooms came from,

32:24.958 --> 32:26.124
but we don't have a motive

32:26.126 --> 32:27.743
or any reason why he
would kill himself.

32:27.745 --> 32:29.328
Maybe you could shed some
light on that for us.

32:29.330 --> 32:30.746
Morocco? Yeah.

32:30.748 --> 32:32.798
That-that's actually where
Harry and I had our time.

32:32.800 --> 32:34.900
But he didn't say
anything about mushrooms.

32:34.902 --> 32:36.468
You were in Morocco?

32:36.470 --> 32:38.303
We didn't see your name
on the airplane manifests.

32:38.305 --> 32:40.038
Yeah, well,
I don't fly commercial.

32:41.040 --> 32:42.707
Oh. So you had a private jet?

32:42.709 --> 32:44.209
Yeah. That's why I went
to Morocco.

32:44.211 --> 32:46.144
Harry was working on
a photo shoot

32:46.146 --> 32:48.480
for Atlanta's Marrakesh spread.

32:48.482 --> 32:51.350
Atlanta? Sofie's mentor?

32:51.352 --> 32:54.319
Atlanta was on a private plane
to Morocco with you?

32:54.321 --> 32:55.553
I gave her a lift.

32:55.555 --> 32:58.924
Like I said,
perception is everything.

32:58.926 --> 33:01.660
That would explain why she
wasn't on the passenger list.

33:02.962 --> 33:04.730
We're looking for Atlanta.

33:04.732 --> 33:07.282
She just went upstairs for a
smoke. Why? What do you want?

33:15.240 --> 33:16.241
Atlanta!

33:17.443 --> 33:21.046
Detective Reagan,
my partner Detective Curatola.

33:21.048 --> 33:22.314
You remember us
from the hospital...?

33:22.316 --> 33:24.983
- Don't come any closer!
- Listen, all right...

33:24.985 --> 33:27.552
- I'll jump! I will!
- All right, I'm stepping back.

33:27.554 --> 33:28.520
Nobody's going to jump.

33:28.522 --> 33:30.021
Just get out of here!

33:30.023 --> 33:31.790
We can't leave you
up there, okay?

33:31.792 --> 33:34.092
We're not going to leave you
unless we know you're safe.

33:34.094 --> 33:35.727
So why don't you just relax and
we'll talk about this, okay?

33:35.729 --> 33:38.930
You have no idea
what it's like for me.

33:38.932 --> 33:43.802
I'm 25 and my life is over.

33:46.372 --> 33:49.307
I've been working Fashion Week
since I was 13.

33:49.309 --> 33:53.378
I booked a dozen shows a year.
But this year?

33:53.380 --> 33:56.715
One show.
And I had to beg for it.

33:56.717 --> 34:00.285
Okay, you don't want to jump
because of that. Okay?

34:00.287 --> 34:02.954
And it's not fair!

34:02.956 --> 34:05.924
I didn't mean to hurt anybody!

34:05.926 --> 34:07.959
Okay, you didn't mean it.

34:07.961 --> 34:09.828
I just thought it would make
Sofie sick,

34:09.830 --> 34:14.800
and that-that I would get to
close the Lara Fortunato show.

34:16.668 --> 34:20.071
I put it in her risotto
when she wasn't looking.

34:20.072 --> 34:24.376
But I don't know what happened
to Milli. And now...

34:24.378 --> 34:26.578
Harry, and that's my fault, too?

34:26.580 --> 34:28.112
Look, it's not your fault.

34:28.114 --> 34:30.081
Harry killed himself, okay?

34:30.083 --> 34:31.516
I killed him.

34:31.518 --> 34:35.320
We were in this bazaar
in Marrakesh.

34:35.322 --> 34:39.224
The shopkeeper had
these mushrooms, and...

34:39.226 --> 34:42.293
Harry didn't see me buy them,
but he suspected me...

34:42.295 --> 34:43.728
Okay.

34:43.730 --> 34:46.764
I told him that
if he ratted me out...

34:46.766 --> 34:50.034
that I would say that
we did this together.

34:51.603 --> 34:53.038
He's dead because of me.

34:53.040 --> 34:55.524
No, he's dead because he killed
himself, all right?

34:55.525 --> 34:57.007
It was an accident;
it's not your fault.

34:57.010 --> 34:59.177
So why don't you just
get down from there, okay?

34:59.179 --> 35:01.112
Come on down, all right?

35:01.114 --> 35:02.814
Come on. Don't do this
to yourself.

35:02.816 --> 35:05.850
Just take my hand.
Come on down.

35:07.203 --> 35:08.587
Come on down.

35:08.589 --> 35:10.455
There you go. Come on.

35:10.457 --> 35:11.856
Come on down.

35:12.858 --> 35:13.758
There you go.

35:13.760 --> 35:15.693
All right.

35:15.695 --> 35:16.795
Yeah, you just stand
right there.

35:16.797 --> 35:18.880
Atlanta aka Lisa Jennings,

35:18.882 --> 35:21.766
you are under arrest
for the murder of Milli Skye,

35:21.768 --> 35:24.469
attempted murder
of Sofie Lightner.

35:24.471 --> 35:26.705
Let's go. Please.
Let's go.

35:32.879 --> 35:34.846
Wendy.

35:36.816 --> 35:38.650
I'm sorry.

35:39.152 --> 35:41.686
I was awful to you yesterday.

35:42.688 --> 35:44.222
Well, if it was one of my boys,

35:44.224 --> 35:45.724
I don't know
what that would do to me.

35:45.726 --> 35:47.359
Oh, don't be nice, Linda.

35:47.361 --> 35:48.627
I can't stand it.

35:50.829 --> 35:53.865
Had a lot of time
to think about things.

35:54.867 --> 35:57.836
Making some changes...

35:57.838 --> 35:59.804
if Sofie comes out of this.

35:59.806 --> 36:03.458
Well, don't even think about
moving back to Staten Island.

36:03.460 --> 36:05.260
You'd go nuts.

36:05.262 --> 36:07.078
Just saying.

36:12.217 --> 36:14.786
She was surrounded by some

36:14.788 --> 36:16.454
desperate people,

36:16.456 --> 36:18.473
and I should have known.

36:18.475 --> 36:21.393
I just wanted it for her so bad.

36:21.395 --> 36:24.062
I closed my eyes to the truth.

36:24.064 --> 36:25.864
You were doing what
you thought was best.

36:25.866 --> 36:27.799
Every mother is guilty of that.

36:27.801 --> 36:29.601
You would have known.

36:29.603 --> 36:31.820
You would've seen
right through them all.

36:33.039 --> 36:36.074
I've always envied
that about you.

36:36.076 --> 36:38.610
You've envied me. <i>Right.</i>

36:38.612 --> 36:41.112
Oh, I mean it.

36:41.114 --> 36:44.783
You have always known
exactly who you are.

36:44.785 --> 36:47.652
You have never
once pretended

36:47.654 --> 36:49.921
to be something you're
not, not for anybody.

36:49.923 --> 36:52.924
Me? I have spent
my whole life

36:52.926 --> 36:54.893
trying to forget
where I came from,

36:54.895 --> 36:56.478
trying to be
something I'm not.

36:56.480 --> 36:59.130
Look where it got me.

36:59.132 --> 37:01.466
Well, I'm guilty of that, too.

37:02.468 --> 37:03.852
I doubt it.

37:09.408 --> 37:11.526
That wasn't my dress
the other day.

37:12.528 --> 37:14.579
What?

37:14.581 --> 37:17.549
I bought it that morning...
kept the tags in it.

37:17.551 --> 37:19.668
I was going to return
it the next day.

37:19.670 --> 37:23.154
Linda. I know.
It was stupid and...

37:23.156 --> 37:27.592
it was terrible but...

37:27.594 --> 37:30.362
I just wanted to impress you.

37:30.364 --> 37:33.665
You're a really sweet sister,

37:33.667 --> 37:35.634
you know that?

37:42.275 --> 37:45.510
It was Staten Island.

37:49.816 --> 37:51.116
Mom?

37:53.686 --> 37:54.852
Hey.

37:54.854 --> 37:57.706
Hi... baby.

37:58.591 --> 38:00.492
Mommy's right here.

38:04.197 --> 38:07.415
Thank you for seeing me,
Francis.

38:07.417 --> 38:09.734
Please sit down,
Your Excellency.

38:11.837 --> 38:13.471
I made you some tea.

38:13.473 --> 38:15.774
I see. Thank you.

38:16.726 --> 38:18.743
I won't stay long.

38:18.745 --> 38:21.746
I'm on my way to deliver
a benediction at the UN.

38:21.748 --> 38:24.315
They need it.

38:24.317 --> 38:26.685
I always knew you had
great things

38:26.687 --> 38:28.553
in store for you, Francis.

38:28.555 --> 38:29.821
Thank you.

38:29.823 --> 38:32.857
And now look at you here
in the catbird seat.

38:32.859 --> 38:35.894
Hot seat, sometimes.

38:35.896 --> 38:37.829
Tell me about it.

38:38.998 --> 38:42.233
Oh, Francis.

38:42.235 --> 38:44.836
We have such fine schools.

38:44.838 --> 38:47.706
95% of our students
go on to college.

38:47.708 --> 38:50.475
They outperform

38:50.477 --> 38:53.478
every state and city test
you can throw at them.

38:53.480 --> 38:56.181
And to lose more schools...

38:56.183 --> 38:59.751
I have thought about
this problem long and hard.

38:59.753 --> 39:03.121
Francis, when we last spoke,

39:03.123 --> 39:06.091
you reminded me of something.

39:06.093 --> 39:07.959
What was that, Your Excellency?

39:07.961 --> 39:09.861
The truth.

39:09.863 --> 39:13.231
Was I sacrificing truth
for expedience

39:13.233 --> 39:15.500
in shipping the problem
to South America?

39:15.502 --> 39:17.268
And the answer was "yes."

39:18.671 --> 39:20.939
But now...

39:20.941 --> 39:23.808
we're going to face
this problem head-on.

39:31.685 --> 39:33.718
How'd the board meeting go?

39:34.887 --> 39:37.956
There's enough in the coffers
for Comforting Community

39:37.958 --> 39:40.658
to fight for another year.

39:40.660 --> 39:43.094
That's great, Pop.

39:43.096 --> 39:44.863
What's better, Francis,

39:44.865 --> 39:48.800
is that Bishop Donovan
changed his mind.

39:48.802 --> 39:51.803
Father McMurray doesn't have
to go to Bolivia after all.

39:55.441 --> 39:58.843
Always nice to hear good news.
