00:08.080 --> 00:10.169
<i>Previously on </i> Cloak and Dagger...

00:10.170 --> 00:11.539
Daddy!

00:11.540 --> 00:12.709
<i>We aren't drilling for oil.</i>

00:12.710 --> 00:14.959
<i>It burned ten times better than oil.</i>

00:14.960 --> 00:17.119
Burns twice as hot. Pumps in the
old rig couldn't handle it.

00:17.120 --> 00:18.829
What gives it that snap?

00:18.830 --> 00:20.579
My secret ingredient: cardamom.

00:20.580 --> 00:21.959
My name's Tandy Bowen.

00:21.960 --> 00:23.119
You knew my dad.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.419
You were there when Billy got shot.

00:29.420 --> 00:30.789
You could tell everyone what you saw.

00:30.790 --> 00:31.829
O'Reilly!

00:31.830 --> 00:33.289
No!

00:33.290 --> 00:35.710
Ty, what's wrong?

00:45.790 --> 00:50.209
"Eye of newt, toe of frog,
wool of bat, leg of dog."

00:50.210 --> 00:53.080
Tongue, Dad.
The quote is "tongue of dog."

00:53.105 --> 00:54.135
Not leg.

00:54.159 --> 00:55.822
Is that the reason
my witches' brew never works?

00:55.847 --> 00:57.926
That and magic doesn't exist.

00:57.951 --> 01:00.039
What do you call turning flour,
sugar, and water into that?

01:00.040 --> 01:01.572
Delicious chemistry.

01:01.597 --> 01:03.127
I'd be willing to bet, Mina,

01:03.151 --> 01:04.959
that primitive humans
would label what you're doing...

01:04.959 --> 01:07.079
Dad! What are you doing?

01:07.080 --> 01:09.169
You can't eat that till you're
at work, that's the rule.

01:09.170 --> 01:12.079
You're awfully superstitious for
someone who doesn't believe in magic.

01:12.080 --> 01:14.169
Yeah, well, you always come home.

01:14.170 --> 01:16.120
- Don't you?
- And I will again.

01:17.880 --> 01:20.460
I think I cracked the perfect cookie.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.119
Oh my God, it smells amazing.
What's in it?

01:26.120 --> 01:28.579
What would you say
if I asked you that question?

01:28.580 --> 01:30.919
I'd say, "Figure it out yourself."

01:30.920 --> 01:32.999
So, figure it out yourself.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.330
Fine.

01:35.620 --> 01:37.789
Hey, it's tongue of dog, isn't it?

01:37.790 --> 01:40.249
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye, honey.

01:40.250 --> 01:42.289
See you soon!

01:57.460 --> 01:59.749
Evening, Tommy. What's the latest?

01:59.750 --> 02:00.959
Status quo.

02:00.960 --> 02:03.169
Drill's at 2300 meters, moving well.

02:03.170 --> 02:04.499
No shale to date.

02:04.500 --> 02:06.169
Temperature crept up to 150,

02:06.170 --> 02:08.619
but I'm guessing it'll come back
down again like it has been.

02:08.620 --> 02:10.378
How'd the installation go?

02:10.380 --> 02:12.419
The conductive shielding tiles?

02:12.420 --> 02:13.619
Never came.

02:13.620 --> 02:16.170
- Wait. They what?!
- They said they told you!

02:20.920 --> 02:23.039
- Hey, boss.
- Hello.

02:23.040 --> 02:25.169
Hey, guys, head to Level 3 when you can.

02:25.170 --> 02:27.829
Hey, Sam! What's going on
with the shielding tiles?

02:27.830 --> 02:29.459
I was told they weren't coming.

02:29.460 --> 02:32.419
- At all?
- That's what I was told.

02:32.420 --> 02:33.920
Son of a...

02:35.080 --> 02:36.999
Hey, Ivan. How's your daughter?

02:37.000 --> 02:38.539
I need Bowen.

02:38.540 --> 02:40.750
- I'm sorry?
- Nathan Bowen, right now!

03:06.380 --> 03:08.709
Hey, why is this taking so long?
I need to talk to...

03:31.269 --> 03:35.934
<font color="#0080ff">Synced & corrected by</font> kinglouisxx
<font color="#0080ff">www.</font>addic7ed<font color="#0080ff">.com</font>

03:39.380 --> 03:40.790
What should I do?

03:44.380 --> 03:45.879
That was my shot.

03:45.880 --> 03:48.540
Duane saw it all happen.
He saw my brother get...

03:49.830 --> 03:51.829
He could've put
that asshole behind bars,

03:51.830 --> 03:54.579
and now he's dead.

03:54.580 --> 03:57.000
And... and I told him to do
the right thing. I told him!

03:58.460 --> 03:59.789
And now he's dead.

03:59.790 --> 04:01.460
What do I do?

04:04.000 --> 04:05.289
My dad...

04:05.290 --> 04:08.420
he used to say our failures
are the steps we climb.

04:09.460 --> 04:10.620
To what?

04:11.790 --> 04:13.170
I don't know.

04:15.920 --> 04:17.829
Look, I know this is gonna sound...

04:20.329 --> 04:22.329
I'm not even sure how to bring it up.

04:22.330 --> 04:23.750
What?

04:26.710 --> 04:28.749
There was a survivor,

04:28.750 --> 04:30.079
of the rig, the one that blew up.

04:30.080 --> 04:33.669
I think he might be the key
to clearing my dad.

04:33.670 --> 04:35.789
But, um, there's... there's a problem.

04:35.790 --> 04:40.119
Look, I know this is just
about the worst possible time,

04:40.120 --> 04:42.709
but I need your help.

04:42.710 --> 04:45.919
- With what?
- A door.

04:58.040 --> 04:59.919
Is this a normal thing for you?

04:59.920 --> 05:01.079
What?

05:01.080 --> 05:03.499
Sneaking into a hospital
with someone in a coma.

05:03.500 --> 05:05.539
Not a coma. Catatonic.

05:05.540 --> 05:08.879
Eight years ago, they pulled a dozen
bodies off the rig that exploded.

05:08.880 --> 05:11.169
Only one of 'em was still alive.

05:11.170 --> 05:12.749
Eight years ago as in...?

05:12.750 --> 05:16.119
As in the night my dad
crashed off the bridge.

05:16.120 --> 05:19.709
The explosion on the rig is what
made Connors pull the trigger.

05:19.710 --> 05:22.580
It also put the vacant sign
on Dr. Hess here.

05:24.880 --> 05:26.289
See?

05:26.290 --> 05:28.879
You are into some messed up shit.

05:28.880 --> 05:30.709
Ty, look, I know this seems crazy.

05:30.710 --> 05:32.829
- Seems?
- I don't know what else to do!

05:32.830 --> 05:35.289
ROXXON has stopped at nothing to
hide what happened on that rig,

05:35.290 --> 05:37.040
and they're blaming my dad
for the whole thing.

05:38.790 --> 05:42.420
Only survivor... means only
person that knows the truth.

05:45.040 --> 05:47.750
This is the only way I know
how to get justice for my dad.

05:56.880 --> 05:58.289
You owe me.

05:58.290 --> 06:00.619
I know.

06:00.620 --> 06:02.619
All right, so what do we do now?

06:02.620 --> 06:04.170
I don't know.

06:05.500 --> 06:06.829
Count to three?

06:06.830 --> 06:08.459
Are you making this up right now?

06:08.460 --> 06:09.710
Completely.

06:13.120 --> 06:14.249
All right.

06:14.250 --> 06:15.709
One...

06:15.710 --> 06:16.920
- Two.
- Three.

06:22.750 --> 06:24.539
Can you hear me?

06:24.540 --> 06:25.540
Loud and clear.

06:27.170 --> 06:28.250
Wow.

06:32.960 --> 06:34.249
This is the door.

06:34.250 --> 06:36.619
This is the door.

06:36.620 --> 06:38.119
And you think I'm the key?

06:38.120 --> 06:39.750
Look.

06:43.750 --> 06:45.749
What do you think is gonna happen?

06:45.750 --> 06:47.750
I have absolutely no idea.

06:49.790 --> 06:51.579
Hey, what's the worst that could happen?

06:51.580 --> 06:52.709
It doesn't open?

06:52.710 --> 06:55.000
I can think of a lot of
worse things that can happen.

07:06.080 --> 07:07.750
Tandy?

07:10.380 --> 07:12.539
Tandy! Tandy, where are we?

07:12.540 --> 07:13.879
I don't know. I...

07:13.880 --> 07:16.380
Ty? What's wrong with that guy?

07:18.000 --> 07:19.115
Oh, don't... don't worry.

07:19.139 --> 07:21.139
- He can't see or hear...
- Ty!

07:30.710 --> 07:32.619
That guy just tried to kill us.

07:32.620 --> 07:33.750
So, clearly, he saw us.

07:35.080 --> 07:36.579
The rules here must be different.

07:36.580 --> 07:38.250
What the hell is going on?

07:41.080 --> 07:42.620
The worst that can happen.

07:44.750 --> 07:46.419
Look, we got to get
out of here. All right?

07:46.420 --> 07:47.460
Come on!

07:48.460 --> 07:49.670
In here! In here, look!

07:54.170 --> 07:55.880
What the hell is going on?

07:56.920 --> 07:58.000
My word.

08:04.580 --> 08:05.580
Something new.

08:05.581 --> 08:11.829
Something delightfully,
incredibly, wonderfully new.

08:11.830 --> 08:13.710
And you talk!

08:15.920 --> 08:17.539
What a time to be alive!

08:23.170 --> 08:25.119
Important question, uh...

08:26.620 --> 08:28.109
Are you here to kill me?

08:28.141 --> 08:29.890
What? No! No!

08:29.891 --> 08:31.390
Splendid.

08:31.391 --> 08:32.851
Come on.

08:33.971 --> 08:36.181
- You're Ivan Hess.
- Who?

08:37.351 --> 08:40.010
- Ivan Hess.
- I don't know who that is.

08:41.010 --> 08:42.100
Well, who are you then?

08:42.101 --> 08:43.970
Uh, I'm me. I don't have a name.

08:43.971 --> 08:45.930
What do I need a name for?
Do you have a name?

08:45.931 --> 08:48.810
Yeah, I'm... I'm Tandy,
and this is Tyrone.

08:48.811 --> 08:50.970
You both must be very
special to have names.

08:50.971 --> 08:53.050
Where are we?

08:53.051 --> 08:54.810
We're here. That's where we are.

08:57.431 --> 08:58.551
Excuse me a moment.

09:00.891 --> 09:03.140
I'm afraid I can't do
anything about the Klaxons,

09:03.141 --> 09:06.050
but I can at least eliminate that
damn ringing that happens halfway.

09:06.051 --> 09:07.600
So many bells.

09:07.601 --> 09:09.310
Now, uh, where were we?

09:09.311 --> 09:11.850
Doesn't matter. You guys wanna...
you guys wanna sit,

09:11.851 --> 09:14.140
and, uh, and watch the game with me?

09:14.141 --> 09:16.350
It's... it's a very exciting game.

09:16.351 --> 09:19.100
It's, um, bottom of the 67th.

09:19.101 --> 09:22.050
It's, uh, tied 1,382.

09:22.051 --> 09:24.220
Wait, wait, wait. Halfway to what?

09:24.221 --> 09:25.350
Hmm?

09:25.351 --> 09:26.890
You just said "halfway."

09:26.891 --> 09:27.971
Uh, yes, to the end.

09:29.391 --> 09:31.140
End of what?

09:31.141 --> 09:32.851
Why, everything. Heh.

09:34.351 --> 09:36.100
All of reality.

09:36.101 --> 09:37.430
Time, space, you, me.

09:37.431 --> 09:41.430
Those unpleasant sociopaths
running through the halls.

09:41.431 --> 09:43.600
Starts with the Klaxons, then, um...

09:43.601 --> 09:44.970
concludes with a bang!

09:44.971 --> 09:46.760
Has no one told you?

09:46.761 --> 09:47.890
Oh my God.

09:47.891 --> 09:50.050
You rang? Get it?

09:50.051 --> 09:52.010
Ty?

09:52.011 --> 09:55.390
- I think we're on the rig.
- How is that even possible?

09:55.391 --> 09:58.350
Wait, wait, wait. Doesn't that
mean everything is gonna explode?

09:58.351 --> 10:01.010
Of course it is, in about
a minute and 47 seconds.

10:01.011 --> 10:02.890
Give or take zero seconds.

10:02.891 --> 10:06.810
So, exactly in one minute
and 43 seconds.

10:06.811 --> 10:08.140
42 now.

10:08.141 --> 10:09.640
- 41.
- Wait, wait, wait!

10:09.641 --> 10:11.140
How... how do we stop this?!

10:11.141 --> 10:12.260
Stop what? 39.

10:12.261 --> 10:13.600
The explosion!

10:13.601 --> 10:16.510
You-You can't stop it!

10:16.511 --> 10:18.970
I mean, you could
if you got to the core room,

10:18.971 --> 10:20.810
and, uh, hit the kill switch button.

10:20.811 --> 10:22.970
Then, closed up all the shut-off valves.

10:22.971 --> 10:24.930
Okay, where... where
are the shut-off valves?

10:24.931 --> 10:27.140
- In the core room.
- Where is the core room?

10:27.141 --> 10:29.721
It's downstairs, of course, in the core.

10:31.141 --> 10:33.891
Okay, okay. Kill
switch and then the valves.

10:34.851 --> 10:36.100
Tandy?

10:36.101 --> 10:37.970
Yeah, let's go.

10:37.971 --> 10:39.550
Hey! But you'll never get there!

10:39.551 --> 10:41.390
It's positively impossible!

10:52.511 --> 10:53.890
What's going on with these workers?

10:57.141 --> 10:59.310
Hope you got better at your thing.

10:59.311 --> 11:00.511
Yeah, me too.

11:23.811 --> 11:25.810
- You All right?
- So you have gotten better.

11:25.811 --> 11:27.550
I think it's easier here.

11:27.551 --> 11:28.970
Still progress though...

11:32.811 --> 11:34.430
Wait, was that the explosion?

11:34.431 --> 11:36.550
No! No, no, it couldn't have been!

11:36.551 --> 11:37.890
I mean, not the big one anyway, right?

11:37.891 --> 11:39.101
Else we'd be dead.

11:48.311 --> 11:51.261
What did the stag say to the doe?

11:52.721 --> 11:55.810
I'm not one to brag, but I told you so.

11:55.811 --> 11:57.930
What's going on? What's happening?

11:57.931 --> 11:59.430
What always happens.

11:59.431 --> 12:01.260
It starts with the Klaxons,
concludes with a bang.

12:01.261 --> 12:03.050
I told you this already.

12:03.051 --> 12:04.310
And it just repeats?

12:04.311 --> 12:06.720
You know, for having names
and being special,

12:06.721 --> 12:08.390
your intellect is in need of a polish.

12:08.391 --> 12:10.470
- How many times?
- Hmm?

12:10.471 --> 12:11.930
How many times has this repeated?

12:11.931 --> 12:14.810
That's a good question.
I tried counting once.

12:14.811 --> 12:16.810
But as you start approaching 100,000,

12:16.811 --> 12:18.470
the numbers become mush.

12:18.471 --> 12:20.640
You know, it makes you think
about the nature of numbers.

12:20.641 --> 12:22.260
I mean, if you think about it,

12:22.261 --> 12:24.390
what are they?

12:24.391 --> 12:25.810
Wait, what was that?

12:25.811 --> 12:27.430
Yeah, I think we better go.

12:27.431 --> 12:29.140
Otherwise, we'll be ripped apart.

12:29.141 --> 12:31.930
Which, I assure you,
is quite unpleasant.

12:31.931 --> 12:33.431
Can you tell us what happened here?

12:34.471 --> 12:35.720
To what?

12:35.721 --> 12:38.720
To here. All of here! Eight years ago.

12:38.721 --> 12:40.390
Listen, just tell us what's going on.

12:40.391 --> 12:41.930
What's happening right here, right now,

12:41.931 --> 12:43.640
every time this whole thing repeats.

12:43.641 --> 12:45.810
Ah! A question I can answer.

12:45.811 --> 12:47.680
Um, okay.

12:47.681 --> 12:50.140
After the Klaxons and emergency lights

12:50.141 --> 12:52.310
is the initial energy expulsion.

12:52.311 --> 12:53.720
That boom we just heard?

12:53.721 --> 12:56.810
It turns... well, everyone
but me and now you,

12:56.811 --> 12:58.510
into bloodthirsty monsters.

12:58.511 --> 13:00.683
I call them "terrors."

13:00.708 --> 13:01.721
Wait, what?

13:01.722 --> 13:03.760
I have a theory about this
energy we're drilling for.

13:03.761 --> 13:05.390
When, uh, improperly released,

13:05.391 --> 13:07.609
it infects the mind with pure fear.

13:07.634 --> 13:09.763
That fear spreads from person to person,

13:09.764 --> 13:11.723
and, well, terrorizes.

13:11.724 --> 13:13.553
Anyway, after about
a minute, the phone rings,

13:13.554 --> 13:14.633
some angry guy on the line.

13:14.634 --> 13:17.973
Thirty seconds after that
is the first explosion.

13:17.974 --> 13:21.893
Everything gets real
unsteady after that,

13:21.894 --> 13:25.133
particularly, my cohorts.

13:25.134 --> 13:27.263
Until, of course, you know,

13:27.264 --> 13:30.554
the big bang that, uh, ends it all.

13:31.554 --> 13:34.763
Or begins it all.

13:34.764 --> 13:37.133
It's, uh, hard to know really.

13:37.134 --> 13:38.304
Tomato and the egg.

13:39.804 --> 13:41.093
Uh, you might want to hide.

13:41.094 --> 13:43.894
Monsieur Flambé is coming.
You don't want him to see you.

13:44.724 --> 13:47.054
- I-I think we better...
- Yeah.

14:06.094 --> 14:07.834
Monsieur Flambé.

14:07.934 --> 14:09.248
That's a good one.

14:09.344 --> 14:10.724
French is funny, <i>oui?</i>

14:12.123 --> 14:13.594
Wee!

14:16.634 --> 14:17.763
We're lollygagging.

14:17.764 --> 14:19.843
And there's no better way
to be gagged by lolly

14:19.844 --> 14:21.093
than to be here when Wrenchy appears.

14:21.094 --> 14:22.633
He's not very nice.

14:22.634 --> 14:24.473
Not as bad as Axey and Chainy, though.

14:24.474 --> 14:27.763
Look, you... you asked us
where we came from before.

14:27.764 --> 14:28.933
We came from the real world.

14:28.934 --> 14:30.763
- And we need your...
- Real world?

14:30.764 --> 14:32.844
Yeah! Yeah, none of this is real.

14:34.554 --> 14:36.223
Now, do you mean that
in a philosophical sense?

14:36.224 --> 14:39.343
Because it... it's very hard
to prove anything is real.

14:39.344 --> 14:41.110
No! No, I mean, this is...

14:41.135 --> 14:42.594
This is not the real world.

14:42.619 --> 14:44.633
This is some sort of catatonic state,

14:44.634 --> 14:46.434
and you've been in it for eight years.

14:58.474 --> 15:01.553
So, you don't remember anything
from before this, do you?

15:01.554 --> 15:03.593
Before what?

15:03.594 --> 15:05.054
This is all there has ever been.

15:07.844 --> 15:09.633
I-I think his mind is shot.

15:09.634 --> 15:11.593
- There's no way we can...
- No!

15:11.594 --> 15:13.803
No, I need him, Ty.

15:13.804 --> 15:15.433
We have to help him to figure out

15:15.434 --> 15:16.594
what really happened here.

15:17.894 --> 15:19.634
There's gotta be a way to get to him.

15:23.394 --> 15:24.594
Ivan.

15:25.804 --> 15:27.724
Ivan, your daughter.
You remember her, right?

15:28.724 --> 15:30.683
- Daughter?
- Yes!

15:30.684 --> 15:32.093
Yes, her name is Mina.

15:32.094 --> 15:34.343
I've heard some whoppers in my time,

15:34.344 --> 15:35.894
but, uh, a daughter?

15:37.014 --> 15:38.433
I don't have a daughter.

15:38.434 --> 15:41.303
I always wanted one
deep down inside, you know.

15:41.304 --> 15:44.223
She's out in the world
right now finishing your work!

15:44.224 --> 15:45.763
What work?

15:45.764 --> 15:48.133
- I don't have any work.
- Yes, you do!

15:48.134 --> 15:50.763
The work you did
with my father, Nathan Bowen!

15:50.764 --> 15:52.054
You guys were partners.

15:53.304 --> 15:55.303
Nathan Bowen?

15:55.304 --> 15:57.554
Bowen. Where do I know that name?

15:59.684 --> 16:01.304
Oh, you mean the guy on the phone?

16:04.054 --> 16:05.844
I'm sorry, did you just say...

16:12.054 --> 16:13.554
Oh my God.

16:15.634 --> 16:17.263
I gotta take this.

16:17.264 --> 16:18.593
It's work.

16:18.594 --> 16:20.803
Nathan Bowen.

16:20.804 --> 16:22.633
Three very bad things
are going to happen.

16:22.634 --> 16:24.553
Number one: structural collapse.

16:24.554 --> 16:27.263
And when the legs buckle
and the hull hits the water,

16:27.264 --> 16:28.513
that'll cause number two,

16:28.514 --> 16:30.514
a very large explosion.

16:31.894 --> 16:33.684
He was talking to you.

16:35.514 --> 16:37.683
Eight years ago, he was talking to you.

16:37.684 --> 16:40.183
I don't understand why he keeps calling.

16:40.184 --> 16:43.633
It's rather annoying.

17:05.634 --> 17:07.394
Daddy?

17:08.894 --> 17:10.554
<i>Hi, pumpkin.</i>

17:15.554 --> 17:16.803
Daddy.

17:17.382 --> 17:20.223
<i>Tandy, I'm confused.</i>

17:20.405 --> 17:22.125
<i>What are you doing on the rig?</i>

17:24.654 --> 17:26.693
That's a really good question.

17:26.726 --> 17:28.474
I called work,

17:28.476 --> 17:30.066
and they connected me.

17:32.856 --> 17:34.895
I just really needed to talk to you.

17:34.896 --> 17:37.605
<i>Okay. All right.</i>

17:37.606 --> 17:39.226
<i>What do you need to say?</i>

17:41.606 --> 17:43.316
I just...

17:46.606 --> 17:48.685
I miss you.

17:48.686 --> 17:50.186
Tandy!

17:53.146 --> 17:55.025
Tandy, what the hell was that?

17:55.026 --> 17:57.605
Listen, we need to find
a way to get out of here.

17:57.606 --> 17:58.935
We... we can't get sidelined...

18:07.896 --> 18:10.065
Tandy, listen to me.

18:10.066 --> 18:11.565
We need to shut off the valves.

18:11.566 --> 18:13.435
We have to get everybody out of here.

18:13.436 --> 18:15.606
- Okay?
- Absolutely.

18:18.606 --> 18:19.816
Eventually.

18:20.896 --> 18:22.356
But, Tandy...

18:28.106 --> 18:29.525
All right, fine, fine.

18:29.526 --> 18:32.066
Fine. I'll... I'll just see
if I can do it myself.

18:43.356 --> 18:44.895
Look at the temp, it's gonna spike!

18:44.896 --> 18:47.065
We keep that up, we'll have
to change out that bit.

18:47.066 --> 18:49.565
It's not the bit. I mean, check
out the vibration indicator.

18:49.566 --> 18:51.395
We're still cutting
through this rock at a clip.

18:51.396 --> 18:53.605
Well, then, what's
heating everything up?

18:53.606 --> 18:55.435
I don't know, but
the pressure's building.

18:55.436 --> 18:57.752
How's that possible?
Nothing has changed!

18:57.777 --> 18:59.760
Let's get the Mud Man
on the line. Maybe he...

19:08.026 --> 19:09.315
Shit!

19:09.316 --> 19:10.343
Sam, are you okay?

19:42.266 --> 19:43.435
Daddy?

19:43.436 --> 19:44.525
Are you there?

19:44.526 --> 19:45.766
<i>I'm here, pumpkin.</i>

19:47.066 --> 19:48.566
I can't believe it's you.

19:49.726 --> 19:51.646
<i>Why are you acting so surprised?</i>

19:52.566 --> 19:53.896
<i>You see me every day.</i>

19:56.526 --> 19:58.475
Not anymore.

19:58.476 --> 19:59.606
<i>What do you mean?</i>

20:02.418 --> 20:03.476
It's just...

20:05.976 --> 20:08.185
that you've been working so much,

20:08.186 --> 20:10.226
I feel like I never get to see you.

20:12.566 --> 20:14.316
I miss it.

20:15.896 --> 20:18.185
<i>Miss our talks.</i>

20:18.186 --> 20:20.185
<i>Our long car rides.</i>

20:20.186 --> 20:23.435
I even... I even miss your bad jokes.

20:23.436 --> 20:26.645
<i>Well, I'm here right now.</i>

20:26.646 --> 20:27.935
<i>What do you want to talk about?</i>

20:28.279 --> 20:30.369
It doesn't matter.

20:31.476 --> 20:32.896
I just want to talk.

20:34.066 --> 20:36.185
<i>Is that okay?</i>

20:36.186 --> 20:37.436
<i>Absolutely.</i>

20:40.066 --> 20:42.435
Tell me about your day.

20:42.905 --> 20:44.234
<i>You don't want to hear about</i>

20:44.235 --> 20:46.114
<i>all that boring, science stuff, do you?</i>

20:46.115 --> 20:47.694
<i>Yeah, I do.</i>

20:52.853 --> 20:54.982
I really do.

20:54.983 --> 20:56.233
I promise.

21:10.943 --> 21:13.483
It didn't work.

21:14.903 --> 21:15.903
What didn't work?

21:18.103 --> 21:19.732
The whole thing, the way
to get him out of here.

21:19.733 --> 21:20.982
I got down to the core,

21:20.983 --> 21:23.147
hit the kill switch, it didn't work.

21:23.983 --> 21:25.562
None of it.

21:26.173 --> 21:29.603
I mean, I got right to it,
and it didn't work, Tandy.

21:30.603 --> 21:32.023
You did?

21:34.313 --> 21:36.102
Wow.

21:36.103 --> 21:38.442
That's actually quite impressive.

21:38.443 --> 21:39.943
I'll be downstairs if you need me.

21:45.773 --> 21:47.522
Look, we need to get
back to the real world.

21:47.523 --> 21:48.942
Okay? Find something else to do.

21:48.943 --> 21:50.352
Because this isn't working.

21:50.353 --> 21:51.772
No.

21:51.773 --> 21:53.812
No, I don't want to go back, I...

21:53.813 --> 21:55.982
Not yet! I wanna stay.
I wanna talk to my dad.

21:55.983 --> 21:57.402
I don't think that's how it works.

21:57.403 --> 21:59.772
We came here together. I-I
might need you to get me out.

21:59.773 --> 22:01.184
You might not.

22:01.232 --> 22:03.232
You think I'm just gonna leave you here?

22:06.063 --> 22:07.193
Okay.

22:08.273 --> 22:09.772
Yeah, okay.

22:09.773 --> 22:11.733
You're right. Let's get out of here.

22:12.773 --> 22:14.313
All right.

22:15.693 --> 22:17.232
How are we gonna do that?

22:17.233 --> 22:20.142
I don't know, but we were
both touching him, right?

22:20.143 --> 22:21.982
Just... let go.

22:21.983 --> 22:23.903
On the count of three, okay?

22:25.813 --> 22:27.022
One...

22:27.023 --> 22:28.943
- Two.
- Three.

22:44.643 --> 22:46.403
Why are you such a good liar?

23:03.903 --> 23:05.693
I should just leave, you know that?

23:19.233 --> 23:21.022
Tandy?

23:21.023 --> 23:22.692
What happened to you, Tandy?

23:22.693 --> 23:24.943
You were supposed to go back
with me to Ivan's hospital room.

23:25.943 --> 23:27.442
Ivan?

23:27.443 --> 23:29.142
Cookie guy?

23:29.143 --> 23:30.903
His name is written all over the papers.

23:33.643 --> 23:34.813
Wait!

23:40.853 --> 23:42.023
Where'd you learn that?

23:43.443 --> 23:46.402
Wait, wait, Tandy. How long
have you been here since I left?

23:46.403 --> 23:50.522
Well, let me answer that question
with a question of my own.

23:50.523 --> 23:54.563
Yeah, okay, shoot.

23:55.853 --> 23:57.522
What was your name again?

24:03.857 --> 24:06.476
- Hi, Dad.
- Tandy.

24:06.563 --> 24:09.352
No, not today. It's just
the same old, same old.

24:09.353 --> 24:11.945
- Tandy!
- Wait, where did we leave off last?

24:13.023 --> 24:15.522
- Oh, right, right.
- Tandy, look at me!

24:15.523 --> 24:17.402
Okay.

24:17.403 --> 24:18.603
Oh...

24:20.443 --> 24:23.076
- What the hell was that?
- You need to snap out of it!

24:23.101 --> 24:24.890
You've lost your mind just like Ivan.

24:24.920 --> 24:27.419
You mean the papers on the desk guy?

24:27.420 --> 24:29.839
No. No, that's a special kind of crazy.

24:29.840 --> 24:31.300
Get it together.

24:32.340 --> 24:34.499
Okay? We both need to get out of here.

24:34.500 --> 24:35.879
No.

24:35.880 --> 24:37.799
No, I'm fine just where I am.

24:37.800 --> 24:39.299
You're not anywhere!

24:39.300 --> 24:43.169
You're stuck in the mind of
an insane, catatonic mud man!

24:43.170 --> 24:45.759
- What's so bad about that?
- Everything!

24:45.760 --> 24:47.920
Everything I just said in that
sentence is... is ridiculous.

24:49.880 --> 24:52.919
Tyrone? Right?

24:52.920 --> 24:55.089
Your name is Tyrone?

24:55.090 --> 24:56.300
Okay, good.

24:57.460 --> 24:58.709
Good.

24:58.710 --> 25:00.879
Good. You... you do remember me.

25:00.880 --> 25:05.840
I remember bits and pieces
of my life, but...

25:07.130 --> 25:09.760
From what I remember, it was horrible.

25:11.420 --> 25:13.799
Nobody called me.

25:13.800 --> 25:16.379
Nobody called me because nobody cared.

25:16.380 --> 25:19.089
No one knows me!
They think that they do, but...

25:19.090 --> 25:20.959
I was homeless,

25:20.960 --> 25:22.759
aimless,

25:22.760 --> 25:24.919
fatherless and friendless.

25:24.920 --> 25:27.050
- Look, you have one friend.
- Who?

25:27.960 --> 25:29.459
Me.

25:29.460 --> 25:30.999
Yeah, we're not friends.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.129
I came along with you
on this, so I could...

25:33.130 --> 25:36.709
If I remember correctly,
I made an emotional appeal.

25:36.710 --> 25:38.999
A damsel in distress and you ate it up.

25:39.000 --> 25:40.999
No. No, Tandy, I'm...

25:41.000 --> 25:43.629
I smelled your weakness
a thousand miles away,

25:43.630 --> 25:45.879
and I played you,
because that's what I do.

25:45.880 --> 25:47.169
I play people.

25:49.050 --> 25:51.459
No, Tandy, no! That's not who you are.

25:51.460 --> 25:53.419
Not here it isn't.

25:53.420 --> 25:54.999
Here I have my stuff.

25:55.000 --> 25:56.959
I have my cards.

25:56.960 --> 25:58.419
I have my hat to throw 'em into.

25:58.420 --> 26:00.669
I have the monsters that stop
by, and I have my phone,

26:00.670 --> 26:01.999
and once everything resets again,

26:02.000 --> 26:03.379
I'll have my dad, too.

26:08.464 --> 26:10.123
Oh, this one's back.

26:10.210 --> 26:11.920
So, how are you?

26:16.960 --> 26:19.460
You know, maybe I better...

26:21.920 --> 26:24.339
If you touch that phone...

26:24.340 --> 26:26.460
What? You'll what?

26:28.630 --> 26:32.499
- How long have you been here?
- I don't know.

26:32.500 --> 26:34.379
I stopped counting after 200.

26:34.380 --> 26:35.589
Tandy, you're sick!

26:35.590 --> 26:38.744
No, actually, for the first time
I can remember, I'm not.

26:38.769 --> 26:39.800
Look, I get it.

26:39.801 --> 26:41.919
You want to hear your dad's
voice again, and I-I get it.

26:41.920 --> 26:43.035
No, you don't.

26:43.098 --> 26:45.098
Look, I might be the only one who does.

26:45.210 --> 26:47.216
- But it's not worth it.
- Bullshit.

26:48.154 --> 26:49.879
You're saying if the situation
were reversed,

26:49.880 --> 26:51.839
you wouldn't want to stay
and talk to your...

26:51.840 --> 26:53.443
what was it, your... your brother?

26:54.300 --> 26:55.919
What was his name again? It was, uh...

26:55.920 --> 26:57.589
It was Bobby, right?

26:57.590 --> 26:59.669
- Billy.
- See?

26:59.670 --> 27:00.799
You feel that?

27:00.800 --> 27:03.759
That anger rising because
somebody forgot his name.

27:03.760 --> 27:06.299
That is exactly what I feel every day!

27:09.590 --> 27:11.209
What did I say?

27:11.210 --> 27:12.999
You're pulling a weapon on me now?

27:13.000 --> 27:14.209
Don't touch that phone.

27:14.210 --> 27:16.919
It's not a phone! It's not real!

27:16.920 --> 27:19.260
None of it is, Tandy.
It's a memory in Ivan's...

27:20.420 --> 27:21.500
Hey, Daddy.

27:23.460 --> 27:25.839
No, I'm just talking
to this guy I used to know.

27:28.260 --> 27:29.419
Why did you do that?!

27:29.420 --> 27:30.879
Because none of it is real!

27:30.880 --> 27:32.709
Now I'm gonna have to wait
for everything to reset

27:32.710 --> 27:33.919
until I can talk to him again!

27:33.920 --> 27:36.340
And I'll be right here to hang
it up every time until you stop!

27:39.920 --> 27:41.550
Are you kidding me right now?

27:42.800 --> 27:44.209
Tandy!

27:44.210 --> 27:45.960
Look, I'm trying to
help you and stop you...

27:47.800 --> 27:49.379
All right!

27:49.380 --> 27:51.089
Fine, Tandy, fine.

27:51.090 --> 27:52.760
But have you told him the truth?

27:53.880 --> 27:56.459
- What truth?
- That nobody calls you?

27:56.460 --> 27:59.999
That you have no friends?
That you push everyone away?

28:00.000 --> 28:02.169
That you're a thief?

28:05.130 --> 28:08.049
I bet you he doesn't even
know you're a liar either.

28:10.760 --> 28:12.959
Does he know that you're in
such a state since he's died

28:12.960 --> 28:14.879
that you've turned to drugs?

28:14.880 --> 28:16.670
What would he think
of his drug addict daughter?

28:28.000 --> 28:30.670
I'm sensing some
aggression between you two.

28:33.800 --> 28:35.340
You know what? Never mind.

28:40.840 --> 28:42.379
Go home, Tyrone.

28:42.380 --> 28:43.919
Damn it, Tandy, you can't just...

28:43.920 --> 28:47.500
Okay, okay. Look, I-I give up.

28:48.670 --> 28:49.799
I get it.

28:49.800 --> 28:52.379
I would do the same thing
if it were Billy.

28:52.380 --> 28:54.130
But honestly, I...

28:56.710 --> 28:58.710
I don't remember the sound
of his voice anymore.

28:59.840 --> 29:02.499
I wouldn't even know if it was him.

29:02.500 --> 29:03.799
The real him.

29:05.090 --> 29:06.839
Tell you what.

29:06.840 --> 29:08.669
I'll leave you here.

29:08.670 --> 29:10.130
Let you be here as long as you want.

29:11.840 --> 29:13.709
If you just ask him one question.

29:13.710 --> 29:16.800
- What question?
- Something Ivan wouldn't know.

29:18.170 --> 29:19.759
What are you talking about?

29:19.760 --> 29:21.799
Look, if this is your dad,

29:21.800 --> 29:23.799
your real dad,

29:23.800 --> 29:26.589
then you can ask him something
that only he would know.

29:26.590 --> 29:28.629
If he answers, then maybe you're right.

29:28.630 --> 29:31.499
Maybe your time is better spent here.

29:31.500 --> 29:33.919
But if this isn't your dad...

29:37.155 --> 29:38.989
Just one question.

29:39.210 --> 29:40.935
Just one question, then I promise,

29:40.959 --> 29:42.615
I'll leave you alone.

29:53.840 --> 29:55.340
Daddy?

29:56.840 --> 29:58.710
I need to ask you a question.

29:59.710 --> 30:01.130
<i>Anything, sweetheart.</i>

30:02.460 --> 30:04.300
Who's in the back of your car?

30:05.760 --> 30:06.880
<i>I don't understand.</i>

30:10.420 --> 30:12.920
You're driving over
Paris Road Bridge right now.

30:15.340 --> 30:16.710
Who's in the back seat?

30:18.880 --> 30:20.170
<i>Nobody.</i>

30:25.880 --> 30:27.590
<i>There's no one in the back seat.</i>

30:32.670 --> 30:34.049
Daddy...

30:34.050 --> 30:35.670
<i>Yeah?</i>

30:37.590 --> 30:39.879
I miss you.

30:39.880 --> 30:41.590
<i>I'm right here, pumpkin.</i>

30:44.170 --> 30:45.710
No.

30:47.260 --> 30:48.669
You're not.

30:51.420 --> 30:52.629
Goodbye, Dad.

31:04.210 --> 31:05.839
Exciting news.

31:05.840 --> 31:07.589
The Red Sox scored.

31:07.590 --> 31:09.549
The game is no longer tied.

31:13.050 --> 31:14.419
What are you doing?

31:14.420 --> 31:17.049
Where do you think
this cookie came from?

31:17.050 --> 31:19.709
Well, if that isn't a theological
question, I don't know what is.

31:19.710 --> 31:21.620
Your daughter made this for you...

31:22.574 --> 31:23.823
eight years ago!

31:23.824 --> 31:25.453
I don't know what you're talking about.

31:25.454 --> 31:26.993
Hey, I-I just wanna watch some more TV.

31:26.994 --> 31:28.863
The Red Sox are finally winning,

31:28.864 --> 31:30.863
- and if they can hold on...
- No!

31:30.864 --> 31:33.113
No, you have a responsibility
as a father.

31:33.114 --> 31:35.413
You can't just leave. It's not fair.

31:35.414 --> 31:37.243
A girl needs her father.

31:37.244 --> 31:39.033
To be there more
than she would ever admit,

31:39.034 --> 31:41.913
and longer than she would
ever admit she needed him.

31:41.914 --> 31:44.783
And listen, sometimes shit
happens and they can't be there.

31:44.784 --> 31:46.914
And it's nobody's fault,
but sometimes...

31:49.034 --> 31:50.704
sometimes they have a choice.

31:51.784 --> 31:54.717
And you have a choice.

31:55.534 --> 31:57.489
A father has to do the right thing.

31:57.514 --> 31:59.823
That is what they're supposed to do.
Do you understand?

32:18.324 --> 32:19.784
She made this for you.

32:21.614 --> 32:25.129
Mina. Do you remember?

32:27.713 --> 32:28.963
I do not.

32:29.824 --> 32:31.743
In her Easy-Bake Oven,

32:31.744 --> 32:35.312
with her own special recipe
and her own secret ingredient.

32:35.337 --> 32:38.382
I vaguely understand
what you're trying to do,

32:38.407 --> 32:41.094
- and I feel I should appreciate it...
- Cardamom.

32:46.553 --> 32:47.893
Of course.

32:50.433 --> 32:52.142
Cardamom.

32:52.143 --> 32:55.642
It's a natural anti-depressant.

32:55.643 --> 32:57.803
She never got the chance to tell me.

33:10.843 --> 33:12.843
That's what it is. It's, uh...

33:13.933 --> 33:15.473
It's cardamom.

33:16.843 --> 33:18.343
Mina...

33:21.143 --> 33:23.762
My Lord, uh, where is she?

33:23.763 --> 33:25.683
She's been visiting you.

33:26.933 --> 33:28.603
Every day in the hospital.

33:29.803 --> 33:30.933
Do you wanna see her?

33:31.973 --> 33:33.343
More than anything.

33:34.343 --> 33:36.803
But... but I can't.

33:37.893 --> 33:39.222
I can't get out of here.

33:39.223 --> 33:41.103
- I'm trapped.
- You might not be.

33:42.223 --> 33:45.432
You just need to get to the core
room, and close the valves.

33:45.433 --> 33:47.342
I thought you said you tried.

33:47.343 --> 33:49.342
I did, but he has to be
the one to do it.

33:49.343 --> 33:51.642
- It's his mind.
- That's impossible.

33:51.643 --> 33:53.642
I can't get down there.

33:53.643 --> 33:54.892
I've tried.

33:54.893 --> 33:56.552
Time and time again.

33:56.553 --> 33:58.932
See, I've...
I've considered every factor,

33:58.933 --> 34:00.642
every variable.

34:03.803 --> 34:06.302
Actually...

34:06.303 --> 34:09.303
there are exactly two variables
you haven't factored in yet.

34:18.723 --> 34:21.763
You, my dear, are
your father's daughter.

34:22.842 --> 34:24.356
I know.

34:36.723 --> 34:38.025
We should get to it.

34:38.723 --> 34:40.891
It isn't gonna be a tied game forever.

35:48.752 --> 35:49.872
He's okay.

35:50.843 --> 35:52.182
You're okay.

35:55.303 --> 35:56.683
Who are you people?

36:01.143 --> 36:02.553
Where's my daughter?

36:05.053 --> 36:06.473
I need to see Mina.

36:11.158 --> 36:12.223
Dad!

36:13.447 --> 36:15.392
- Dad!
- Hi. Ohh.

36:17.053 --> 36:18.939
Oh, I missed you.

36:20.683 --> 36:22.302
- Oh my...
- How you doing?

36:22.303 --> 36:24.183
You look great.

36:30.473 --> 36:31.802
You okay?

36:31.803 --> 36:34.222
Yeah, of course.

36:34.223 --> 36:35.973
- You?
- Yeah.

36:39.553 --> 36:41.182
Hey.

36:41.183 --> 36:43.295
Your dad?

36:43.553 --> 36:47.147
What he said about the steps we climb?

36:48.843 --> 36:50.473
He was right.

36:56.723 --> 36:58.302
He usually was.

38:40.698 --> 38:43.428
- Hello?
- Hey.

38:43.552 --> 38:45.522
Hey, is it too late to call?

38:45.616 --> 38:46.655
Totally.

38:46.656 --> 38:49.655
Lenny the altar rat has a
big meeting in the morning.

38:52.536 --> 38:53.995
How'd you get this number?

38:53.996 --> 38:55.680
<i>Well, you're not the only one</i>

38:55.705 --> 38:58.291
<i>with a sweet con-artist sleight of hand.</i>

38:58.496 --> 38:59.866
<i>And, um...</i>

39:01.496 --> 39:02.796
I don't know. I...

39:06.116 --> 39:07.706
just needed someone to talk to.

39:09.156 --> 39:10.326
About what?

39:11.616 --> 39:14.209
<i>I dug out this old tape.</i>

39:14.382 --> 39:18.662
My father, um, gave us
his old hand recorder,

39:18.826 --> 39:20.467
and we messed around with it.

39:20.576 --> 39:23.814
<i>I haven't thought about it
in years, I mean...</i>

39:23.996 --> 39:25.156
Then you did.

39:27.770 --> 39:30.140
- Why'd you call me?
- I...

39:32.536 --> 39:34.935
I just needed someone
who would understand.

39:38.436 --> 39:39.685
Press play.

39:44.894 --> 39:46.393
<i>I want to play with it!</i>

39:46.394 --> 39:48.233
<i>Dad gave it to me, Ty-Ty.</i>

39:48.234 --> 39:50.029
<i>But let me play with it, please!</i>

39:50.814 --> 39:52.584
<i>Yeah, okay, okay.</i>

39:52.644 --> 39:55.023
<i>Can you make this sound for me?
There you go.</i>

39:59.774 --> 40:01.644
<i>Go.</i>

He was actually pretty good.

40:41.730 --> 40:43.690
Yeah.

40:44.774 --> 40:46.733
Yeah, he was.

40:46.734 --> 40:48.733
You, on the other hand...

40:48.734 --> 40:50.455
you were horrible.

40:50.650 --> 40:53.593
Oh, come on. I was like six years old.

40:53.705 --> 40:55.455
Yeah, even for a six-year-old.

40:56.766 --> 41:00.136
<i>- But I'll excuse it, you know why?</i>
- Why?

41:01.128 --> 41:02.957
'Cause you hadn't met me yet.

41:02.989 --> 41:05.198
Yeah, that must be it.

41:06.495 --> 41:08.165
Hey.

41:10.366 --> 41:12.116
Can you play it again?

41:14.289 --> 41:16.326
Yeah, yeah.
