02:26.329 --> 02:28.386
You speak English?

02:29.399 --> 02:32.227
Kru Po, he teaches you, right?

02:35.504 --> 02:38.731
Listen, I wanna train with Kru Po!

02:40.142 --> 02:42.334
I have cash.

02:52.020 --> 02:53.876
I just wanna train.

03:12.208 --> 03:13.368
What the hell, man?

03:13.468 --> 03:16.935
I can't take you to Kru Po,
if you have no skills.

03:41.469 --> 03:44.930
Hey! Prove it!

04:24.279 --> 04:26.572
Kavi fights better when he's drunk.

04:27.749 --> 04:30.155
Yeah, he's so drunk
it's almost a fair fight.

04:59.916 --> 05:02.675
- He's very fast.
- No, you're very slow.

05:23.572 --> 05:25.197
Por favor.

05:42.325 --> 05:46.128
Thank you.
I just lost my position as doorman.

05:46.328 --> 05:48.220
You started it.

05:48.320 --> 05:51.690
What? You attacked me.

05:52.533 --> 05:55.972
I come a long way.
I wanna train with Tong Po.

05:56.072 --> 05:58.563
I wanna train with Master Po.

06:22.731 --> 06:24.956
Put it back.

06:32.640 --> 06:34.866
And the money.

06:40.715 --> 06:43.174
You know what, keep it.

06:44.753 --> 06:47.455
- All of it?
- Yeah.

06:47.555 --> 06:50.048
You need it more than I do.

07:00.251 --> 07:05.490
You fighters from around the world
have been invited to train with Master Po.

07:05.840 --> 07:08.209
And witness the impossible.

07:08.309 --> 07:12.781
Now, you might think that Master Po
has run out of the unthinkable.

07:12.881 --> 07:15.850
But he'd like to challenge himself
and stay creative.

07:15.950 --> 07:21.012
And continue to inspire you all
with an infinite imagination.

07:22.007 --> 07:24.365
Check it out!

07:47.582 --> 07:51.169
The universe is composed of particles.

07:51.269 --> 07:55.141
Which are subjected
to the power of the focus.

07:55.241 --> 07:57.576
Quiet mind.

07:57.676 --> 08:01.686
Again I say! Check it out!

08:23.786 --> 08:25.955
- And can I get an amen?
- Amen!

08:26.055 --> 08:29.665
That's what I'm talking about.
The fight will begin.

08:34.229 --> 08:38.923
Unless first,
somebody wanna challenge Master Po.

08:40.802 --> 08:43.989
You mean to tell me there's
nobody here batshit crazy enough

08:44.089 --> 08:46.921
to go a couple rounds with the master?

08:53.882 --> 08:57.309
- Can I get another amen?
- Amen!

09:00.622 --> 09:02.647
Let's fight.

09:17.972 --> 09:21.500
The next round we will add weapons.

11:00.576 --> 11:02.901
You come here to kill me?

11:16.057 --> 11:17.949
Sloane.

11:19.427 --> 11:23.388
Your brother was brave,
your brother was a warrior.

11:24.432 --> 11:26.673
Unlike you...

11:27.088 --> 11:29.186
such a coward.

11:29.871 --> 11:33.898
Come to my home with a gun...

11:34.225 --> 11:36.331
to kill me in my sleep.

11:52.693 --> 11:58.123
Ladies and gentlemen, my brother,
Eric Sloane, world champion.

12:01.903 --> 12:03.873
Come on, you do it.

12:03.973 --> 12:06.865
- We're gonna do this?
- Absolutely.

12:07.526 --> 12:09.317
Alright.

12:15.350 --> 12:18.376
One more time, one more time. Ready?

12:20.755 --> 12:22.581
I need a drink.

12:28.396 --> 12:32.357
- I'm gonna get some wine.
- Well, look who it is.

12:33.335 --> 12:37.255
- What brings you to this side of town?
- Here to see the fabulous Eric Sloane.

12:37.355 --> 12:39.523
- You look great.
- Thank you.

12:39.623 --> 12:43.478
- You've made a quiet a name for yourself.
- I'm working on it.

12:43.578 --> 12:47.639
- Almost a modern day warrior.
- Almost.

12:48.049 --> 12:50.001
Heard you won the gold.

12:50.101 --> 12:52.588
Yeah, I did.

12:52.688 --> 12:54.923
So, what's next?

12:55.023 --> 12:59.093
I don't know. Probably expand the gym,
get some new equipment.

12:59.193 --> 13:03.365
- Well, I have an idea.
- I bet you do, my dear.

13:03.465 --> 13:06.802
You're gonna have to talk to Kurt because
he's my manager now as well as my trainer.

13:06.902 --> 13:10.163
Always looking out for baby brother,
I love that about you.

13:10.263 --> 13:12.591
Taking care of him?
Are you kidding me, he takes care of me.

13:12.691 --> 13:15.716
He always pushes me in the right direction,
and pulls me with no strings attached

13:15.866 --> 13:19.628
unlike some people in this game.

13:20.049 --> 13:23.201
Right. So, who wants to go to Thailand?

13:23.301 --> 13:26.221
Jesus, can you give a guy a moment
of victory? We're having a party here.

13:26.321 --> 13:29.291
- I'm talking immortality.
- Immortality.

13:29.391 --> 13:30.845
No rules, no ref.

13:30.945 --> 13:34.462
- Just your wit and skill to keep you alive.
- What do you mean no rules?

13:34.562 --> 13:39.701
No, wait, I heard about these underground
fights over here, but what's in it for us?

13:39.801 --> 13:42.627
Well, 200k right now.

13:45.206 --> 13:47.775
And 200 when you land.

13:47.875 --> 13:50.935
And the chance to be remembered
for a lifetime.

13:51.612 --> 13:53.881
Alright, now we're talking. Keep going.

13:53.981 --> 13:56.351
I've got this fighter
by the name of Tong Po.

13:56.451 --> 14:00.107
He's an undefeated Muay Thai champ.
And I think you can take it,

14:00.207 --> 14:03.714
and make us all a ton
of cash while doing so.

14:03.825 --> 14:06.317
Kurt, wanna go to Thailand?

14:07.027 --> 14:11.332
You know what, let's talk about it later.
Let's have a drink! It's a party!

14:11.432 --> 14:12.901
Just don't let her get into your head.

14:13.001 --> 14:15.470
It's not her getting into my head, have
you ever seen this kind of cash before?

14:15.570 --> 14:17.539
We could buy this place
and be set for life.

14:17.639 --> 14:20.943
Eric, if you decline it's okay.

14:21.043 --> 14:23.301
It's not for everyone.

14:24.711 --> 14:27.950
She comes in, looks at you, smiles at you,
and you fall into her trap? She's a crook!

14:28.050 --> 14:29.718
She's a fight promoter Kurt,
they're all crooks.

14:29.818 --> 14:32.154
Our job is to get as much cash load
as we can while I'm on top.

14:32.254 --> 14:35.924
- You don't know what you're walking into.
- Kurt, you're driving me crazy with this.

14:36.024 --> 14:39.728
That Thai champ should be worried about me.
I'm a badass. Stop being a coward.

14:39.828 --> 14:41.596
I'm looking out for you and your career.

14:41.746 --> 14:44.639
Stay here and do
what you do best, just worry.

14:45.516 --> 14:49.871
You really think you can take the Thai champ
at his sport? Are you that arrogant?

14:49.971 --> 14:53.915
Well, I know you don't,
so I guess I'll be doing this alone.

14:56.877 --> 14:59.170
Thanks for the party.

15:00.615 --> 15:02.945
You're just gonna walk away?

15:03.777 --> 15:06.265
I'm walking toward a future.

15:42.924 --> 15:45.016
Hey, Kurt!

15:46.127 --> 15:48.019
Kurt!

15:49.730 --> 15:52.190
You got something from Eric.

16:03.978 --> 16:06.337
He's fighting in a week.

16:12.587 --> 16:14.878
His gold medal?

16:16.324 --> 16:18.716
I gotta go to Thailand.

17:50.551 --> 17:53.277
Get up! Come on!

18:39.083 --> 18:41.409
Eric! Get out!

19:16.020 --> 19:19.280
Eric! Eric!

20:36.250 --> 20:38.642
I'm so sorry.

20:53.834 --> 20:55.726
Kurt.

21:00.641 --> 21:02.361
You set him up.

21:02.461 --> 21:06.837
We got him the best trainer.
He trained his ass off.

21:08.682 --> 21:11.886
Eric knew what he
was getting himself into.

21:11.986 --> 21:14.534
Sometimes these things just happen.

21:14.634 --> 21:16.848
You killed him!

21:19.661 --> 21:22.219
This is on you. This is all on you!

21:29.019 --> 21:32.111
I'm just gonna say goodbye
and then I'll leave.

22:22.956 --> 22:25.161
Taking care of him? Are you kidding me,
he takes care of me.

22:25.261 --> 22:29.849
He always pushes me in the right direction,
and pulls me with no strings attached.

23:03.998 --> 23:05.599
Who's this?

23:05.699 --> 23:08.603
I think this is your brother's trainer.

23:08.703 --> 23:11.462
I think he may have something for you.

23:22.316 --> 23:24.896
Do you mind? I'm training him.

23:32.192 --> 23:35.418
- Are you Durand?
- Yes, I am.

23:35.796 --> 23:38.222
This is Eric's brother.

23:42.536 --> 23:44.428
Here.

23:47.175 --> 23:51.602
This is Eric's fee for his fight.
He wanted you to have this.

23:52.179 --> 23:54.772
If anything happened to him.

23:56.016 --> 23:58.241
And of course...

24:01.321 --> 24:03.413
it did.

24:06.994 --> 24:10.864
- You're making a joke.
- Do I look like I'm laughing?

24:10.964 --> 24:14.685
- You trained my brother Muay Thai?
- Yes, I did.

24:14.785 --> 24:19.239
- Why would you let him fight that monster?
- I train people.

24:19.339 --> 24:23.701
I don't tell them when to fight
and who to fight.

24:26.980 --> 24:29.941
You didn't train him well enough, did you?

24:35.756 --> 24:39.750
We have to go. Kurt! Let's go!

25:04.451 --> 25:07.555
I'm putting you on a plane
out of the country.

25:07.655 --> 25:12.826
If you stay, come back,
you will go to jail.

25:12.926 --> 25:15.218
You get it?

25:46.894 --> 25:48.986
Oh, Mr. Sloane.

25:54.534 --> 25:58.106
We normally would welcome you
to Master Po's humble home,

25:58.206 --> 26:01.408
but it's clear that you're here
with dubious intentions.

26:01.808 --> 26:04.312
But when Michael Corleone
was sitting in the restaurant

26:04.412 --> 26:07.415
across from the two men
who attempted to kill his father,

26:07.515 --> 26:10.952
many argued that he was wrestling
with his conscious

26:11.052 --> 26:14.788
to whether or not he could
kill them in cold blood.

26:14.888 --> 26:19.628
I however believe that the decision
were made the night he visited his father.

26:19.728 --> 26:22.643
And saw him barely alive in the hospital.

26:23.163 --> 26:28.125
He had no choice, really.
He had to pull the trigger.

26:32.539 --> 26:34.755
And as for you, Mr. Sloane,

26:34.855 --> 26:37.895
all you had to do was pull the trigger.

26:42.583 --> 26:44.292
I should have.

27:16.633 --> 27:18.492
You're coming with me.

27:43.911 --> 27:48.483
By going after Tong Po like that,
you made things very hard on yourself.

27:48.583 --> 27:52.687
And on my investigation. You're the only
eye witness wiling to come forward

27:52.787 --> 27:55.123
and now you're credibility's
gonna be questioned.

27:55.223 --> 27:57.247
Credibility?

30:13.293 --> 30:16.787
I guess I should thank you
for saving my life.

30:17.264 --> 30:21.601
- I'm the one that put you there.
- You know I have orders to arrest you?

30:21.701 --> 30:25.739
- What about those guys in the street?
- We'll take care of them.

30:25.839 --> 30:29.766
In the meantime your brother's trainer
has agreed to shelter you here.

30:30.143 --> 30:34.104
- When did that happen?
- It's just for a few days.

30:59.372 --> 31:01.999
Train me to fight Tong Po.

31:14.754 --> 31:17.013
I failed Eric.

31:21.795 --> 31:24.354
What am I gonna do with you?

31:45.051 --> 31:47.744
You're gonna help me make this right.

33:55.782 --> 33:58.108
I will train you.

33:58.752 --> 34:02.980
We wake up at five. No coffee break.

35:01.948 --> 35:05.408
- What's going on?
- Forgot to numb the nerves.

35:53.768 --> 35:55.736
- Oh, my God.
- What?

35:55.836 --> 35:58.639
- What are those from?
- Training.

35:58.739 --> 36:02.431
- What kind of training does that to you?
- Training with Durand.

36:05.778 --> 36:07.515
Why are you putting yourself through that?

36:07.615 --> 36:10.077
When I'm training, when I'm in that place

36:10.177 --> 36:13.820
the pain just turns my brain off.

36:14.237 --> 36:16.230
I don't feel anything.

36:20.360 --> 36:21.992
That's good.

36:31.237 --> 36:33.463
How do you feel?

36:34.225 --> 36:36.760
- You're crazy.
- I'm crazy?

36:36.860 --> 36:38.816
One more time.

36:54.027 --> 36:57.120
Just give me a minute to catch my breath.

37:03.303 --> 37:04.638
Why would you do that?

37:04.738 --> 37:07.635
Do you think Tong Po
would give you a break?

37:25.959 --> 37:27.785
Splits?

37:29.004 --> 37:31.322
We have more to do.

37:39.839 --> 37:41.409
- You look tired.
- Are you tired?

37:41.509 --> 37:45.045
- He gets tired so easy.
- Why don't you rest?

37:45.145 --> 37:47.137
He won't let me.

37:47.547 --> 37:49.517
Let's have a coconut break.

37:49.617 --> 37:51.742
- Coconuts!
- Coconut break!

37:52.752 --> 37:54.778
You like coconuts?

38:03.162 --> 38:05.366
You're supposed to try
to crack open the coconuts.

38:05.466 --> 38:07.757
Let me show you.

38:14.975 --> 38:16.800
Kurt.

39:01.955 --> 39:04.974
- I'm ready, Durand.
- You're ready?

39:05.574 --> 39:07.753
I am ready.

39:40.326 --> 39:42.852
See? I'm ready.

39:46.713 --> 39:49.296
You think you're ready?

39:49.396 --> 39:51.885
Let's get a drink.

40:38.117 --> 40:40.976
Oh, he was unlucky, wasn't he?

40:41.922 --> 40:45.058
Is there anyone that can beat my fighter?

40:45.158 --> 40:51.375
Five thousand baht. If you can last
two rounds gets you 50,000 baht.

40:51.475 --> 40:54.724
Anyone? Anyone?

40:58.838 --> 41:03.066
Master Durand.
Lovely to see you again, mate.

41:04.811 --> 41:08.548
You've brought me
some more easy money, have ya?

41:09.248 --> 41:13.086
I'm just messing with ya.
Joseph King by name.

41:13.186 --> 41:16.180
Joe King by nature.

41:17.824 --> 41:20.212
- Looks stuck up this one, yeah?
- Yeah.

41:20.312 --> 41:22.662
What can I do for ya?

41:22.762 --> 41:24.820
Two rounds.

41:30.036 --> 41:31.438
Your funeral.

41:31.538 --> 41:33.874
- 5,000, two rounds?
- That's right.

41:33.974 --> 41:37.033
- With him?
- You're ready, no?

43:49.308 --> 43:50.910
This way.

43:51.010 --> 43:54.693
Like I said before, just stay put.
You cannot leave this compound.

43:54.793 --> 43:58.351
Do you understand?
It's just not safe for you out there.

43:58.451 --> 44:00.619
Just come by anytime, I'll be right here.

44:00.719 --> 44:03.323
Wait a second,
you said he was in training.

44:03.423 --> 44:08.027
- Training for what exactly?
- I'm a trainer. That's what I do.

44:08.127 --> 44:13.022
- You stay away from Tong Po.
- I'll keep him busy. Don't worry.

44:13.122 --> 44:15.634
And just stay put, okay?

44:15.734 --> 44:18.460
Don't make me bring you an ankle bracelet.

44:26.778 --> 44:29.005
Great distraction.

44:31.884 --> 44:34.276
And not a distraction.

44:35.254 --> 44:39.348
- What are you doing here?
- They kicked me out.

44:41.160 --> 44:43.462
He's from Tong Po's camp.

44:43.562 --> 44:45.654
Please, come.

44:55.342 --> 44:59.201
Just go for a second,
I need to talk to him.

45:01.781 --> 45:04.206
Why did you come here?

45:05.384 --> 45:09.823
Maybe you came here to get
a reward from the cops, right?

45:09.923 --> 45:11.796
Or maybe...

45:11.896 --> 45:16.876
you came here because of your master...

45:16.976 --> 45:18.921
Tong Po.

45:19.021 --> 45:23.136
- Look, Master Durand.
- Yes?

45:23.236 --> 45:25.256
Maybe...

45:25.951 --> 45:28.999
maybe you should have trained Eric better.

46:35.524 --> 46:37.783
Tell me the truth.

46:38.060 --> 46:40.414
Okay, I work for Tong Po.

46:40.514 --> 46:44.016
Now you work for me. And Kurt.

46:44.116 --> 46:47.843
- How am I gonna get paid?
- Get paid?

46:48.254 --> 46:51.924
You will keep your teeth. Laundry.

46:52.024 --> 46:55.417
Stop drinking and start to train.

46:56.028 --> 46:58.120
You're good.

47:16.182 --> 47:18.417
Not impressed by your performance.

47:18.517 --> 47:21.043
Never gonna win going back.

48:37.897 --> 48:39.925
Tighter.

48:40.025 --> 48:42.434
Tighter. Yeah, that's good.

48:42.534 --> 48:45.962
Come from the inside. Push up the chin.

48:46.472 --> 48:49.198
Hands up, break hard.

49:11.997 --> 49:16.859
If you're afraid to die in a fight
with Tong Po... you're dead.

49:17.870 --> 49:20.329
I don't want to lose two sons.

49:32.485 --> 49:34.776
Tong Po's head.

50:40.069 --> 50:43.429
Tong Po! Tong Po!

50:53.332 --> 50:55.384
Tong Po!

50:55.484 --> 50:57.253
Tong Po!

50:57.353 --> 51:00.538
Tong Po! Come on, Tong Po!

51:03.108 --> 51:06.442
Tong Po! I challenge you to a fight!

51:12.451 --> 51:14.343
Storm!

51:19.658 --> 51:21.803
Let's go, bring it.

52:53.552 --> 52:58.113
Master Po has gladly
accepted your challenge.

52:58.457 --> 53:00.649
Be prepared.

53:06.632 --> 53:10.736
Master Po has gladly
accepted your challenge.

53:10.836 --> 53:14.129
Eric's little brother wants revenge.

53:14.874 --> 53:17.132
A grudge match.

53:30.689 --> 53:34.383
Tong Po! I challenge you to a fight!

53:51.944 --> 53:55.114
Wattona, darling?
What seems to be the problem?

53:55.214 --> 53:57.282
Your place is compromised.

53:57.382 --> 54:00.853
Do you know what we could do with this
information knowing that she's listening?

54:00.953 --> 54:04.212
We could send her
to a much better place for us.

54:05.290 --> 54:07.459
It's been her crusade for years.

54:07.559 --> 54:10.786
Without her,
none of this would be happening.

54:15.367 --> 54:19.328
Without her, doesn't that sound ideal?

54:24.643 --> 54:27.379
You want it clean or messy?

54:27.479 --> 54:29.938
Make her an example.

56:03.041 --> 56:05.400
You don't have to do this.

57:12.193 --> 57:14.919
This is for your own good.

57:16.715 --> 57:19.618
You're both under arrest.
You're a fugitive.

57:19.818 --> 57:22.177
You're harboring a fugitive.

57:24.023 --> 57:27.449
Love and Muay Thai don't mix.

57:40.172 --> 57:43.965
So your girlfriend
won't let you fight Tong Po.

57:47.312 --> 57:49.838
We have to get out of here.

57:53.501 --> 57:55.260
Okay.

58:55.080 --> 58:57.305
Vous parlez francais?

59:01.152 --> 59:02.888
Hey.

59:02.988 --> 59:05.246
Forgot about me?

59:10.929 --> 59:12.821
Hey!

59:20.639 --> 59:22.464
Sorry.

59:31.081 --> 59:32.907
Hey!

59:46.831 --> 59:49.057
Come on!

01:00:27.439 --> 01:00:29.731
Let's go.

01:00:55.834 --> 01:00:58.937
Just let everyone know initial bets
can be placed before the first round.

01:00:59.037 --> 01:01:01.629
No betting during fight time.

01:01:19.758 --> 01:01:22.635
A man's strength in Muay Thai

01:01:22.735 --> 01:01:26.353
is not just his destructive capacity.

01:01:26.453 --> 01:01:31.059
There are often 30 to 50 deaths
in the ring each year.

01:01:31.436 --> 01:01:35.307
One of those deaths
occurred not so long ago.

01:01:35.407 --> 01:01:37.676
Right here on this spot.

01:01:37.776 --> 01:01:42.537
Another will occur today, right here.

01:01:42.881 --> 01:01:45.340
Let's meet the challenger!

01:02:01.433 --> 01:02:03.296
Kurt Sloane.

01:02:03.396 --> 01:02:07.299
The brother of the last man
who died by Tong Po's hand.

01:02:09.207 --> 01:02:12.244
His fury over the death of his brother

01:02:12.344 --> 01:02:16.771
has led to one attempt at Tong Po's life.

01:02:17.048 --> 01:02:19.647
He wants revenge so much

01:02:19.747 --> 01:02:23.570
that he broke out of jail
just to be here with us today

01:02:23.670 --> 01:02:27.192
and face his formidable enemy

01:02:27.292 --> 01:02:29.718
in mortal combat!

01:02:33.231 --> 01:02:35.490
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:02:35.590 --> 01:02:40.192
the undisputed champion
of all champions...

01:02:40.905 --> 01:02:44.642
the man who defies the laws of physics.

01:02:44.742 --> 01:02:48.019
The man who is responsible

01:02:48.119 --> 01:02:50.148
for more than half the deaths

01:02:50.248 --> 01:02:53.585
in the ring in the last two years...

01:02:53.685 --> 01:02:55.887
usually in the first round.

01:02:55.987 --> 01:02:59.292
I give you... Tong Po!

01:02:59.392 --> 01:03:03.804
Tong Po! Tong Po! Tong Po...

01:03:27.652 --> 01:03:30.121
You know what to do.

01:03:30.962 --> 01:03:33.734
Don't think about anything else.

01:03:36.327 --> 01:03:40.369
That champion's amulet
has been around his neck for too long.

01:03:40.848 --> 01:03:43.768
Now you have the spirit
of Muay Thai in you...

01:03:43.868 --> 01:03:46.294
and he's going down.

01:04:22.507 --> 01:04:24.569
Fighters!

01:04:39.491 --> 01:04:42.053
The rounds will be progressive,

01:04:42.153 --> 01:04:46.354
weapons will be added, chosen by me.

01:04:46.998 --> 01:04:52.097
But the first round
is only on the eight points of contact.

01:04:55.206 --> 01:04:57.298
Ready to die...

01:05:00.045 --> 01:05:01.970
After you.

01:05:02.380 --> 01:05:04.705
Back to your corner!

01:05:11.523 --> 01:05:13.414
Champion!

01:05:14.726 --> 01:05:16.617
Challenger.

01:05:23.067 --> 01:05:24.926
Fight!

01:07:10.108 --> 01:07:11.833
Come on, up.

01:07:26.124 --> 01:07:29.283
- Is it done?
- Half of 'em lined up.

01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:32.798
- Anyone betting on Kurt?
- Couple of guys went for the odds.

01:07:32.898 --> 01:07:35.656
Just about three mil on Tong Po.

01:07:35.833 --> 01:07:39.393
I'm gonna have Po stretch it out
a round, even the odds.

01:07:48.046 --> 01:07:50.138
Sit down.

01:07:52.885 --> 01:07:55.176
You're doing well.

01:07:56.737 --> 01:08:00.014
- What fight are you watching?
- This one, come on.

01:08:02.527 --> 01:08:06.788
You're doing exactly what I want, okay?
You're doing very well.

01:08:19.310 --> 01:08:22.779
Surprise, surprise, surprise.

01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:26.541
The challenger is still alive.

01:08:26.818 --> 01:08:28.819
So let's up the ante.

01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:32.680
Second stanza, glass.

01:08:39.229 --> 01:08:42.055
Place your bets.

01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:10.522
Come on, get up.

01:12:14.847 --> 01:12:16.604
Again.

01:13:38.029 --> 01:13:40.054
Sit down.

01:13:44.468 --> 01:13:46.237
Okay.

01:13:46.337 --> 01:13:49.140
- How you doing?
- Not good.

01:13:49.240 --> 01:13:51.231
Remember...

01:13:51.742 --> 01:13:56.681
he's just a man. Like you,
his bones can break and he can bleed.

01:13:56.781 --> 01:14:00.240
Now go in there
and take that son of a bitch out.

01:14:02.419 --> 01:14:04.111
Come on.

01:14:04.288 --> 01:14:06.114
Let's go.

01:14:30.881 --> 01:14:33.240
You're under arrest.

01:14:33.550 --> 01:14:37.722
Look, you should really check this out
before you do something stupid.

01:14:37.822 --> 01:14:41.068
- I've got some juice down in Metro.
- Yeah, I know all about it.

01:14:41.168 --> 01:14:43.354
It'll come out in prosecution.

01:14:46.280 --> 01:14:48.306
I'll be out in a day.

01:15:07.986 --> 01:15:09.916
I am in a state of shock,

01:15:10.016 --> 01:15:13.238
Sloane's heart is still beating.

01:15:14.391 --> 01:15:19.854
He's proven himself a worthy
opponent for Master Po.

01:15:20.497 --> 01:15:24.001
And with that we move
into our final round,

01:15:24.101 --> 01:15:27.928
and the weapons shall be
our double swords.

01:15:39.483 --> 01:15:42.443
Death is imminent.

01:15:58.269 --> 01:16:00.094
Fight!

01:17:16.547 --> 01:17:20.508
Get up. The swords. Get up!

01:17:49.580 --> 01:17:53.273
Your brother was brave.
Your brother was a warrior.

01:17:55.453 --> 01:17:59.540
Unlike you... such a coward.

01:17:59.640 --> 01:18:04.699
If you're afraid to die in a fight
with Tong Po, you're dead.

01:18:05.596 --> 01:18:08.188
I don't want to lose two sons.

01:18:11.735 --> 01:18:14.094
You don't have to do this.

01:18:48.605 --> 01:18:50.464
Come on.

01:19:11.662 --> 01:19:16.056
You're a warrior and he's going down.

01:19:50.267 --> 01:19:51.493
Come on.

01:19:56.373 --> 01:19:58.965
That's my boy!

01:20:56.266 --> 01:20:58.125
Coconut.

01:21:01.238 --> 01:21:03.930
Again, coconut!

01:21:09.046 --> 01:21:10.604
Come on.

01:21:35.439 --> 01:21:36.897
Yeah!

01:22:55.586 --> 01:22:57.964
This is for Eric.
