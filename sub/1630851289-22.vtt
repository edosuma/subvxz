00:01.727 --> 00:03.076
-(school bell rings)
-Run.

00:03.078 --> 00:04.837
Run like a boy
who knows how to run.

00:05.064 --> 00:07.155
Am I doing it? It feels crazy!

00:07.174 --> 00:08.674
We got to get to the house ASAP.

00:08.825 --> 00:11.510
We need to find
Tina's erotic friend journals,

00:11.737 --> 00:12.827
read 'em-- up-bup-bup--

00:12.847 --> 00:13.904
figure out what's going on

00:14.073 --> 00:15.347
with her whole
horse shirt drama,

00:15.574 --> 00:17.257
so we can say the absolute
perfect thing to fix it,

00:17.334 --> 00:18.575
so she'll take us to boba,

00:18.744 --> 00:20.627
and we have to do it all
before Tina gets home.

00:20.688 --> 00:21.669
Coming through, people!

00:21.838 --> 00:23.580
This is a boba-based emergency!

00:23.673 --> 00:25.265
(panting) Beautiful baby.

00:25.359 --> 00:26.341
Thank you.

00:26.360 --> 00:27.509
<i> TEDDY:</i>
<i> Well, the good news is,</i>

00:27.603 --> 00:29.086
it can't get much worse, Bob.

00:29.104 --> 00:31.755
I mean, they wrote "Bob's
Burgers is poop" on the wall.

00:31.757 --> 00:34.516
What are they gonna write next,
"Bob's Burgers is pee"?

00:34.535 --> 00:36.777
That's not nearly as bad,
on the spectrum of

00:36.853 --> 00:38.203
what human waste
you're most like.

00:38.430 --> 00:40.998
I still see it
when I close my eyes.

00:42.268 --> 00:43.600
(whispers): I'm gonna go
check it out in there.

00:43.619 --> 00:46.436
-Okay, but, um, be discreet.
-Yup, yup.

00:46.455 --> 00:47.695
Excuse me, sir.

00:48.532 --> 00:51.108
Nothing!
No graffiti. All clear.

00:51.126 --> 00:52.609
I mean, not all clear.

00:52.611 --> 00:54.035
-Eh...
-Thanks, Teddy.

00:54.129 --> 00:55.962
Sorry.
He doesn't usually do this.

00:56.115 --> 00:57.222
(breathless): Hey, Dad.
We're gonna pop upstairs

00:57.299 --> 00:59.283
real quick/for a long time,

00:59.285 --> 01:00.967
but you're doing really great
in here,

01:01.120 --> 01:02.544
-so you'll be fine.
-We're so proud of you.

01:02.563 --> 01:04.063
Mm-hmm.

01:04.290 --> 01:05.672
-Whoa.
-Oh, my.

01:05.824 --> 01:08.308
I can't find the erotic,
sexy stories anywhere.

01:08.477 --> 01:10.069
When did Tina get so good
at hiding stuff?

01:10.220 --> 01:12.554
Well, maybe it was
ever since you read her diary

01:12.648 --> 01:14.981
every day for a month
because you saw a documentary

01:15.134 --> 01:16.633
about teens and drinking.

01:16.726 --> 01:17.910
I had to. I'm a good mom.

01:18.137 --> 01:19.745
Yeah, but you didn't have
to circle stuff

01:19.822 --> 01:21.138
and make comments
in the margins.

01:21.156 --> 01:23.640
Shush. You don't even have kids.
What do you know?

01:23.659 --> 01:25.066
Oh, my God.

01:25.160 --> 01:27.644
-What are you doing up here?
-Eh, it was slow down there.

01:27.737 --> 01:28.903
-No...
-Louise.

01:28.997 --> 01:31.315
So, I thought I'd close
the restaurant for a bit

01:31.333 --> 01:32.649
and see
how it was going up here.

01:32.668 --> 01:36.153
What's that? Is that
a box of chewed gum?

01:36.171 --> 01:37.337
It's Jimmy Jr.'s gum.

01:37.431 --> 01:38.913
She got it from under his desk
at school.

01:38.933 --> 01:40.324
It's all very normal.

01:40.434 --> 01:42.342
I mean, Linda, when you said
you were gonna "poke around

01:42.469 --> 01:44.919
in Tina's room,"
I pictured like a spy,

01:44.939 --> 01:47.773
but this is
like a really messy spy.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.257
She's gonna be mad--
at you guys.

01:49.351 --> 01:51.184
I might pretend
I didn't come in.

01:51.278 --> 01:53.094
Well, she's gonna be madder
when her birthday is

01:53.188 --> 01:54.446
a big fat nothing sandwich

01:54.598 --> 01:56.615
with a side of "you must not
love me very much,

01:56.766 --> 01:58.525
-Mom and Dad" soup.
-Huh.

01:58.677 --> 01:59.767
This chair feels weird.

01:59.787 --> 02:01.011
How do you think
the chair feels about you?

02:01.104 --> 02:02.195
Feels like something's in there.

02:02.348 --> 02:03.605
-In your butt?
-Gene.

02:03.699 --> 02:05.273
Ha! I found them!

02:05.367 --> 02:06.792
You guys have been looking
for so long,

02:07.019 --> 02:08.610
and I found them, like,
right away.

02:08.704 --> 02:11.204
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Take it easy,
Mr. I Sat Somewhere.

02:11.357 --> 02:13.298
Listen, we don't know which one
she was writing in last,

02:13.525 --> 02:14.782
so everybody
just start skimming.

02:14.802 --> 02:17.043
We've got "Grease:
Extra Greasy,"

02:17.196 --> 02:19.045
"Jurassic Park After Dark,"

02:19.198 --> 02:20.697
"The Fast and The Flirt-ious,"

02:20.866 --> 02:22.307
and "Saving Private Rear Ends."

02:22.459 --> 02:24.309
We're running out of time
before Tina gets home,

02:24.536 --> 02:26.036
-so let's get to it.
-Where is Tina?

02:26.129 --> 02:27.146
Huh. Oh, yeah.

02:27.297 --> 02:29.148
Maybe she joined
an after-school club?

02:29.375 --> 02:31.316
Kids with glasses after classes?

02:31.468 --> 02:33.393
People!
We're wasting precious seconds.

02:33.487 --> 02:35.395
Now, if you find something,
shout it out.

08:27.566 --> 08:30.008
The car? We can just run there.
It's so close.

08:30.159 --> 08:32.736
But if we take the car,
then we'll be in a car.

08:32.754 --> 08:35.496
Yeah, I tried running earlier
and did not care for it.

08:35.516 --> 08:37.331
I'm with Dad.
Mom, you're dumped.

08:37.351 --> 08:40.076
Let's stand here and talk about
all of this some more, huh?

08:40.095 --> 08:41.411
Come on, we're moving. Let's go.

08:41.504 --> 08:43.188
Just pretend
we're a different family

08:43.357 --> 08:44.597
who doesn't hate exercise
so much!

08:44.691 --> 08:45.690
-Oh, God.
-Damn it!

08:45.842 --> 08:47.508
TINA:
This idea seemed better

08:47.528 --> 08:49.102
in my head. (sighs)

08:49.196 --> 08:50.587
Should I not be here?

08:50.680 --> 08:52.105
Should I not be doing this?

08:52.257 --> 08:53.940
Human Tina, you have to do this.

08:54.034 --> 08:55.759
Oh. Um, hi.

08:55.777 --> 08:57.944
Hi. It's the only way
to stop them,

08:58.096 --> 08:59.186
to stop the judgment.

08:59.281 --> 09:00.855
Judging everyone all the time,

09:00.949 --> 09:03.065
-like a bunch of judgy...
judges.
-Judys?

09:03.118 --> 09:04.209
-Who?
-Nothing.

09:04.360 --> 09:05.769
And then everyone can be
themselves and wear

09:05.862 --> 09:06.953
whatever really fun horse

09:07.105 --> 09:09.289
or not-horse-related shirts
they want,

09:09.383 --> 09:10.273
without fear.

09:10.292 --> 09:12.199
(sighs) You're right.

09:12.219 --> 09:13.051
Hello?

09:13.278 --> 09:14.702
-Okay, bye.
-Are you in here,

09:14.796 --> 09:16.871
running-away-from-me kid?

09:16.965 --> 09:19.299
You can just say
a simple yes or no.

09:19.500 --> 09:20.633
(phone vibrates)

09:20.786 --> 09:22.118
Hi, Greg. Just working.

09:22.287 --> 09:25.379
Chasing down a student,
et cetera. What's up?

09:25.399 --> 09:27.673
I sent you the design
for the T-shirts.

09:27.826 --> 09:28.958
You didn't get the JPEG?

09:29.127 --> 09:30.643
Yeah, it says
"Greg and Yuli and Ethan's

09:30.796 --> 09:33.646
Crazy Coastal Road Trip:
The Men Are Doing Maine."

09:33.799 --> 09:35.056
Well, I'll send you the files,

09:35.075 --> 09:36.908
and you can do
all the drop shadows you want.

09:37.135 --> 09:38.076
Okay, goodbye.

09:38.227 --> 09:39.986
All right, if you're in here,

09:40.080 --> 09:42.655
just do me a favor
and stay put, okay?

09:42.749 --> 09:44.490
It<i> is</i> a good T-shirt design.

09:44.643 --> 09:46.084
Phew. (grunts)

09:46.235 --> 09:49.236
Does every T-shirt in the world
have to be judged? Greg?

09:49.256 --> 09:51.238
Though it does sound
a little busy.

09:51.258 --> 09:53.166
Crap. The gym window's not open.

09:53.318 --> 09:54.408
It's always open.

09:54.428 --> 09:55.835
Maybe they closed them
for hot yoga?

09:55.987 --> 09:58.412
I mean, I don't know if sneaking
in a window of the school

09:58.506 --> 10:00.247
would have been
a great idea anyway.

10:00.383 --> 10:01.674
Why, 'cause it's illegal?

10:01.768 --> 10:03.660
'Cause it's trespassing?
'Cause of those dumb reasons?

10:03.753 --> 10:05.770
Yeah, Bob, what'd you think
we were gonna do here?

10:05.997 --> 10:07.439
Say, "Knock, knock.
Hi, our daughter's

10:07.666 --> 10:09.924
possibly destroying some stuff
inside. Mind if we come in?"

10:09.943 --> 10:12.644
-Yeah, Dad.
-Well, I wasn't gonna say
"Knock, knock."

10:12.871 --> 10:15.171
Okay, new plan: someone
throws me up on the roof,

10:15.264 --> 10:16.189
we go from there.

10:16.341 --> 10:18.174
-Ooh...
-Maybe...

10:18.193 --> 10:19.659
-No.
-Why not?!

10:22.456 --> 10:23.680
Okay, I'm in.

10:23.698 --> 10:26.015
Just gonna walk over here,
nice and quiet.

10:26.034 --> 10:27.016
(grunts)

10:27.035 --> 10:28.184
Cool. Cool. Cool, cool.

10:28.203 --> 10:30.111
Please let no one
have heard that.

10:30.130 --> 10:31.704
Okay, a few more little tweaks,

10:31.857 --> 10:33.614
and then I send it to Greg,

10:33.634 --> 10:35.541
and then it's back to
hunting down the child culprit.

10:35.636 --> 10:37.802
And I still don't think
it needs a drop shadow.

10:37.954 --> 10:41.598
Ooh, but what about outer glow?

10:42.717 --> 10:43.791
Oh, boy.

10:43.960 --> 10:46.369
Hammer, this has to stay
between you and me.

10:46.462 --> 10:49.372
Although maybe I should
get rid of you after this.

10:49.391 --> 10:51.298
Maybe throw you in the ocean?

10:51.318 --> 10:52.876
But, hey, you might like it.

10:52.894 --> 10:54.486
You could meet
a hammerhead shark?

10:54.713 --> 10:56.321
-(chuckles) Sorry.
-BOB: It's not good.

10:56.548 --> 10:57.697
LOUISE:
It's the best we've got.

10:57.883 --> 10:58.898
GENE:
Dad, read the room.

10:59.050 --> 10:59.824
Everyone's on board.

11:00.051 --> 11:01.142
LINDA:
It makes sense, Bob.

11:01.161 --> 11:02.327
We build a human catapult.

11:02.554 --> 11:03.811
You lie crosswise on top of me,

11:03.905 --> 11:06.331
Louise stands on your head.
Gene jumps on your feet.

11:06.482 --> 11:08.166
Boing!
Louise goes flying.

11:08.317 --> 11:10.001
-There's Tina.
-OTHERS: Tina!

11:10.153 --> 11:11.561
Oh, no. Shh!

11:11.654 --> 11:12.820
We were looking for you!

11:12.839 --> 11:14.488
Well, you found me, okay?
Now shh!

11:14.582 --> 11:17.658
I'm trying not to get caught,
um, doing my schoolwork,

11:17.736 --> 11:21.328
because they don't like that
for some reason.

11:21.497 --> 11:22.681
Oh... Got it.

11:25.760 --> 11:29.170
Tina! Oh, my baby!
Are you okay? Are you hungry?

11:29.264 --> 11:31.505
Mom, it's fine.
Could you just keep it down?

11:31.525 --> 11:33.507
Right, sorry, sorry.
Wait a minute.

11:33.527 --> 11:35.585
Don't tell me to keep it down,
Little Miss Being in School

11:35.603 --> 11:37.921
When You're Not Supposed to Be
and Breaking Things.

11:38.014 --> 11:40.089
Tina,
we found your journal stories.

11:40.108 --> 11:41.941
-I mean, I found them.
-I found the important one.

11:42.093 --> 11:43.943
We read the robot story
and the P.S.

11:44.095 --> 11:46.187
and the P.P.S.,
and so we know you came here

11:46.206 --> 11:47.931
to destroy the screen thingy.

11:48.024 --> 11:49.857
We haven't finished it yet,
so no spoilers.

11:49.951 --> 11:51.543
So, what did you smash
the screen with?

11:51.770 --> 11:53.436
A crowbar? A baseball bat?

11:53.455 --> 11:54.454
Your bare fists?

11:54.548 --> 11:55.605
I brought our hammer.

11:55.698 --> 11:57.440
-Nice.
-We have a hammer?

11:57.533 --> 11:58.550
There's my handyman.

11:58.777 --> 11:59.776
But I haven't done it yet.

11:59.794 --> 12:00.777
-Oh, good.
-Oh, thank God.

12:00.795 --> 12:02.779
Um, then maybe don't do it?

12:02.797 --> 12:04.280
Ooh! That's a fun idea.

12:04.299 --> 12:06.449
Yeah, 'cause of all the trouble
you would get into?

12:06.468 --> 12:09.102
H-How about let's get you
out of there somehow

12:09.212 --> 12:10.470
and then leave?

12:10.622 --> 12:12.713
We-we could, you know,
not punish you right away.

12:12.807 --> 12:14.566
-First we could...
-All go for boba?

12:14.735 --> 12:17.051
I don't have my boba outfit on,
but I can make this work.

12:17.070 --> 12:19.404
Tina, we love you.
We can talk about this.

12:19.573 --> 12:22.223
No! This is...
this is something I have to do.

12:22.317 --> 12:24.576

-Uh, Tina.
-What?

14:44.626 --> 14:47.276
Uh... you should know
that hammer is, uh...

14:47.295 --> 14:48.444
it fell in the toilet.

14:48.463 --> 14:50.113
Ew, gross.
You should just drop it.

14:50.131 --> 14:52.039
Oh. I'll wash my hands after?

14:52.133 --> 14:53.874
-Tina, you're my hero.
-BOTH: Louise!

14:53.968 --> 14:56.285
-Aw! Okay, here I go.
-Tina.

14:56.287 --> 14:58.212
-What?
-I just wanted to say hi.

14:58.289 --> 14:59.546
-Um, hi.
-GENE: Hi.

14:59.641 --> 15:01.641
Okay, guys, if I could just
do this real quick?

15:01.809 --> 15:02.567
(screams)

15:02.718 --> 15:06.462
Um... what...?

15:06.481 --> 15:08.222
Hey... there.

15:08.316 --> 15:11.058
Hmm. Where is that pesky nail?

15:11.077 --> 15:14.303
-M'kay.
-Uh, Tammy.
What are you doing here?

15:14.397 --> 15:16.155
I left my good ChapStick here,
and I didn't want to get

15:16.307 --> 15:17.582
any more school air on it.

15:17.659 --> 15:19.400
So I banged on the door
for, like, ten minutes,

15:19.494 --> 15:20.826
and then the security guy
let me in,

15:20.921 --> 15:22.569
and I was like,
"What took you so long?"

15:22.589 --> 15:23.663
And he was like,
"I definitely have not been

15:23.739 --> 15:24.981
using the school computer,"

15:25.074 --> 15:26.832
and I was like, "Whatever."
Wait a minute.

15:26.985 --> 15:28.742
What the fart, Tina?
Why are you in the newsroom?

15:28.762 --> 15:31.337
With a hammer? After school?

15:31.431 --> 15:33.080
'Cause I'm a newsperson,
and I know

15:33.099 --> 15:35.416
that there's not usually hammers
in newsrooms.

15:35.435 --> 15:36.325
Uh... I...

15:36.344 --> 15:37.677
Um, and why did you take down

15:37.829 --> 15:40.329
the poster board stuff
that we put on the window?

15:40.348 --> 15:42.941
Uh... to give the equipment
a nice view?

15:43.168 --> 15:44.925
Wait, don't.

15:44.945 --> 15:46.444
-Hi...
-Hey there.
-Hello.

15:46.671 --> 15:48.004
Tina, I'll say it again.

15:48.022 --> 15:50.523
-What. The. Fart?
-LINDA: Tina's, uh,

15:50.675 --> 15:52.341
-sleepwalking.
-Yeah, we got to get her home.

15:52.435 --> 15:55.436
Also, yeah,
she goes to bed at 5:30.

15:55.604 --> 15:56.437
GENE:
Mm-hmm.

15:56.605 --> 15:58.272
(gasps) O-M-God, Tina!

15:58.366 --> 15:59.457
You were gonna smash something
in here,

15:59.608 --> 16:01.033
-weren't you?
-LINDA: What? No...

16:01.186 --> 16:02.368
(all disagreeing)

16:02.520 --> 16:03.962
Mr. Grant told us
that you talked to him

16:04.113 --> 16:06.113
about shutting down
the Wow or Weird segment.

16:06.132 --> 16:08.449
(gasps) You were gonna smash
the touch screen!

16:08.543 --> 16:09.634
No...

16:09.861 --> 16:11.694
You sneaky little...

16:11.713 --> 16:13.362
Hold on, I need
some more ChapStick.

16:13.381 --> 16:15.031
(grunting)

16:15.124 --> 16:16.516
...screen smasher.

16:20.038 --> 16:21.813
Wait, so I'm a hero,
'cause I stopped you

16:21.964 --> 16:23.314
from smashing the touch screen.

16:23.466 --> 16:24.890
And now I'm gonna shout
for the security guard

16:25.043 --> 16:26.058
to come and tackle you
and take you to jail.

16:26.135 --> 16:27.151
(inhales deeply)

16:27.378 --> 16:28.377
ALL:
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

16:28.396 --> 16:30.213
Tammy, just listen to me.

16:30.231 --> 16:32.565
The Wow or Weird segment
is awful.

16:32.659 --> 16:33.974
It's mean. It's judgy.

16:33.994 --> 16:35.809
It makes people feel
terrible about themselves.

16:35.829 --> 16:38.479
Um, Tina,
that's super hypocritical,

16:38.540 --> 16:40.906
'cause you just made me
feel bad about myself.

16:41.001 --> 16:42.241
So, yeah.

16:42.335 --> 16:43.893
Ugh! I'm just gonna do it.

16:43.911 --> 16:45.486
-I don't care if I get
in trouble.
-What? No.

16:45.563 --> 16:47.505
-(grunts)
-LINDA: Tina, no!
-BOB: Wait! Tina!

16:47.656 --> 16:50.491
Uh, listen.
This Wow or Weird segment,

16:50.510 --> 16:52.510
which, by the way,
does not seem like news...

16:52.661 --> 16:54.754
-Uh, it's news.
-It's not, but, you know,

16:54.848 --> 16:57.998
people are always gonna find
a way to judge other people.

16:58.018 --> 17:00.501
To write that
you're poop or crap

17:00.520 --> 17:02.336
on the bathroom wall
of your restaurant,

17:02.355 --> 17:04.022
which makes you cry
a little bit

17:04.173 --> 17:07.358
when you clean it up,
but, um... yeah.

17:07.510 --> 17:09.343
Is that the end of your speech?

17:09.512 --> 17:11.529
What your father's
trying to say is,

17:11.756 --> 17:13.698
you got to find a way
to live in a world

17:13.925 --> 17:15.258
that's gonna judge you.

17:15.351 --> 17:17.760
Even if I want to find
everyone who makes you feel bad

17:17.853 --> 17:19.019
and hit 'em
with a bag of oranges.

17:19.039 --> 17:20.613
-Lin.
-What? Shush.

17:20.707 --> 17:23.115
Everybody feels kind of
fragile about who we are.

17:23.209 --> 17:25.768
We all worry about
people thinking we're weird

17:25.861 --> 17:27.745
or we're crap or we're lame.

17:27.881 --> 17:30.548
-Do kids still say "lame"?
-Lame ones do. Just kidding.

17:30.775 --> 17:33.384
Kids say "lamb"
when we're talking about kebabs.

17:33.536 --> 17:36.370
And, hey, maybe it would be
easier to have a machine

17:36.389 --> 17:38.372
that would wipe us
so we'd never do anything

17:38.466 --> 17:40.132
that would get us judged again.

17:40.285 --> 17:42.635
But, if we did,
then we'd also be wiping out

17:42.804 --> 17:44.378
the part that gives us moments

17:44.397 --> 17:46.564
of being brave
and expressing ourselves.

17:46.715 --> 17:50.793
I feel like what I was trying
to say wasn't as smart as that,

17:50.795 --> 17:53.571
and your mom is kind of
helping me realize that,

17:53.798 --> 17:56.966
yeah, sometimes the things
you do that make you vulnerable,

17:56.984 --> 18:01.245
they wouldn't mean as much if
everyone just loved everything.

18:01.397 --> 18:02.638
I'm not really following,

18:02.657 --> 18:05.141
but I also don't want anyone
to talk anymore.

18:05.310 --> 18:06.976
Maybe you guys are right.

18:06.994 --> 18:09.570
Maybe I shouldn't destroy
school property

18:09.589 --> 18:10.904
and probably get expelled.

18:10.924 --> 18:12.423
-Oh, good.
-Oh, thank god.
-Aw, nuts.

18:12.575 --> 18:13.740
Here, Dad, catch.

18:13.793 --> 18:15.651
-Oh, God, please don't.
-Right, right.

18:15.744 --> 18:17.503
YULI:
Okay. I'm done
with the other thing,

18:17.597 --> 18:20.823
and now I'm back to finding you,
school prowler person.

18:20.842 --> 18:23.584
-Oh, no. He's coming.
-What's happening?
What do we do?

18:23.603 --> 18:25.828
We need a cover story.
We're charming vagrants.

18:25.921 --> 18:26.938
Quick, let's find a trash can

18:27.089 --> 18:28.439
with a fire in it
and sing around it.

18:28.591 --> 18:30.108
Are you in...

18:30.335 --> 18:31.500
this room? Oh.

18:31.519 --> 18:33.945
It's the girl who banged
on the door really loud.

18:34.096 --> 18:35.429
Uh, everything okay in here?

18:35.523 --> 18:37.840
Uh...

18:37.933 --> 18:39.175
Yup. Just me in here.

18:39.268 --> 18:40.451
Nobody else. (farts)

18:40.603 --> 18:43.287
That was not me.
That was you. So, bye.

18:43.439 --> 18:45.272
-(phone vibrates)
-All right. (gasps)

18:45.366 --> 18:47.274
Oh! Greg loves the new JPEG.

18:47.293 --> 18:49.034
He loves it! Road trip!

18:49.187 --> 18:51.796
-Tammy,
why didn't you tell on me?
-I don't know.

18:51.965 --> 18:53.522
Don't make a big deal about it.

18:53.616 --> 18:56.208
I mean, maybe I only started
the Wow or Weird segment

18:56.361 --> 18:58.619
because I had to get braces,
and then I was worried

18:58.638 --> 19:01.213
people were gonna be all...
(grunts) about it,

19:01.366 --> 19:02.715
and so I wanted to say
they were wow

19:02.884 --> 19:04.475
before someone said
they were weird.

19:04.702 --> 19:07.145
-You were worried
people were gonna judge you?
-What?

19:07.372 --> 19:09.889
No. Never. How could
anyone judge me? I'm great.

19:10.041 --> 19:11.207
Well, thanks.

19:11.225 --> 19:13.651
I better go.
I guess, out the window?

19:13.802 --> 19:15.561
Um, does this work for everyone?

19:15.713 --> 19:17.213
-(grunts)
-Oh. Okay. Yeah.

19:17.306 --> 19:19.048
Tammy, I just want to say,
it's kind of nice to know

19:19.217 --> 19:20.807
we're sort of in this together.

19:20.902 --> 19:23.068
-Okay, yup, bye,
closing the window on your head.
-Oh, um, but-- Okay.

19:23.163 --> 19:24.403
I got her. I got her.

19:24.497 --> 19:25.997
-Ah! (groans)
-TINA: Ah! Sorry.

19:26.224 --> 19:27.890
BOB:

19:51.674 --> 19:52.523

20:05.112 --> 20:06.204
I'm a genius.

20:06.431 --> 20:07.538
Olivia Newton-John is a genius.

20:07.690 --> 20:09.448
We're both geniuses
and we're cool.

20:10.526 --> 20:12.601
Nothing else matters anymore.
This is everything.
