00:42.127 --> 00:43.665
I, um...

00:43.698 --> 00:45.535

00:47.204 --> 00:48.875
Topographical.

00:48.908 --> 00:50.712
It shows all the towns
that were here

00:50.745 --> 00:53.383
before the dam went up
and the lake was formed.

00:54.485 --> 00:57.425

00:57.458 --> 01:00.130

01:00.163 --> 01:01.767

under the lake.

01:01.800 --> 01:03.638

01:03.671 --> 01:05.207
No, it's not.

01:05.240 --> 01:07.178
And with the drought,
we can totally get to it.

28:18.204 --> 28:20.408
My brother died in the lake.

And he wasn't stupid
and he could swim.

28:25.118 --> 28:29.293

28:46.394 --> 28:48.065

28:48.098 --> 28:49.300

was wearing this.

28:55.379 --> 28:58.987

29:03.261 --> 29:05.533

29:05.566 --> 29:08.338
That would be the state's
own favorite son,

29:08.371 --> 29:10.342
Mr. Wrede Prescott.

29:10.375 --> 29:13.148
In Georgia, they were putting up
dams like ticks on a hound,

29:13.181 --> 29:14.885
and he wanted to make sure

29:14.918 --> 29:16.989
the Tar Heel State didn't get
left behind.

29:17.022 --> 29:20.095
Plus, he'd get a cut of
all the power the dam generated,

29:20.128 --> 29:23.101
so he stood to make a fortune.

29:23.134 --> 29:24.237
But there were a lot of people
out there

29:24.270 --> 29:25.272
that didn't like that dam.

29:25.305 --> 29:27.209
And out of pure spite,

29:27.242 --> 29:29.280
he rounded up three of the men

29:29.313 --> 29:31.317
that had caused him
the most trouble.

29:32.587 --> 29:35.125

30:32.339 --> 30:34.477

30:34.511 --> 30:37.316
The dam's been up
for almost 90 years.

30:37.349 --> 30:39.053
Who's leading this fight?

30:39.086 --> 30:42.293
Every year we file
a formal petition,

30:42.326 --> 30:46.167
scrape up the signatures
to have the dam taken down,

30:46.200 --> 30:48.506
in the name of the lives
lost in the building

30:48.539 --> 30:51.211
and all the lives lost
over the decades.

30:51.244 --> 30:53.950
And every year
that petition sinks

30:53.983 --> 30:57.356
no matter how many people sign.

30:57.389 --> 30:58.926
Why?

30:58.959 --> 31:03.435
Wrede Prescott left
an endowment to protect the dam.

31:03.468 --> 31:07.309
Not that he was so interested
in the damned thing himself,

31:07.342 --> 31:09.480
but because he knew
when they drained the lake

31:09.514 --> 31:11.351
it would reveal his crime

31:11.384 --> 31:14.190
and destroy
his precious family name.

31:14.223 --> 31:15.960
His money's held in trust

31:15.993 --> 31:18.064
at a law firm that fights
tooth and nail

31:18.097 --> 31:20.235
to keep that dam up,

31:20.268 --> 31:23.341
beats off any attempt
to decommission the dam.

31:24.678 --> 31:27.249

That's the firm.

it's been keeping
the Prescott Dam

32:19.621 --> 32:21.692
from being torn down.

32:21.725 --> 32:23.428
What?

32:23.461 --> 32:27.169
You were involved in that,
weren't you?

32:27.202 --> 32:29.006
I don't understand.

32:29.039 --> 32:31.477
You were involved in the effort

32:31.511 --> 32:35.586
to keep the Prescott Dam
up and running. Yes or no?

32:37.122 --> 32:38.725
Yes, I'm in charge of
the entire case.

32:39.728 --> 32:42.032
What does this got to do
with anything?

32:42.065 --> 32:44.705
The man you work for,

32:44.738 --> 32:47.677
the man who built this dam--

32:47.710 --> 32:50.415
Wrede Prescott-- he's a monster.

32:50.448 --> 32:51.351
(chuckles):
What are you talking about?

32:51.384 --> 32:52.452
He's been dead for years.

32:53.488 --> 32:54.390
I'm sure he was accused of
a lot of bad things,

32:54.423 --> 32:58.031
but so is
every successful businessman.

32:58.064 --> 33:01.471
Do all businessmen chain people
to concrete so they can drown?

33:01.505 --> 33:03.341
-Where did you hear
something like that?
-I didn't just hear I.

33:03.374 --> 33:05.178
I saw it.

33:06.147 --> 33:07.751
Like you saw Jake
in your bathroom

33:07.784 --> 33:10.088
and out by the pool.

33:11.525 --> 33:13.228
I really think
you need some help.

33:13.261 --> 33:15.065
What, are you gonna put Mom
in a mental hospital, too?

33:15.098 --> 33:18.739
Dad, hundreds of people
have died in this lake.

33:18.772 --> 33:20.710
People die in lakes
all the time.

33:20.743 --> 33:22.514
The busier the lake,
the more people die.

33:22.547 --> 33:25.485
Lake Prescott is one of
the busiest lakes in the state.

33:25.519 --> 33:28.224
Prescott murdered people
to get what he wanted,

33:28.257 --> 33:31.464
which means that you've been
taking money from a murderer.

33:31.498 --> 33:34.771
-Yeah, well, so have you.
-Me?

33:34.804 --> 33:38.779
You didn't know,
and you didn't want to know.

33:38.812 --> 33:41.250
You never cared
where our money comes from.

33:41.283 --> 33:43.355
Every now and again you say
you want to go back to teaching,

33:43.388 --> 33:45.526
but none of that pays
for the kids' private schools,

33:45.559 --> 33:48.098
your country club membership,
your BMW

33:48.131 --> 33:50.135
with all the bells and whistles,
our house...

33:50.168 --> 33:51.271
Dad, that's not fair.

33:51.304 --> 33:52.607
ERIN:
You always said that

33:52.640 --> 33:54.410
the house has been
in your family for years.

33:54.443 --> 33:56.114
Yeah, that's right. My family.

33:56.147 --> 33:58.385
Our house, our money,
this cottage,

33:58.418 --> 34:01.157
this lake, this town,
is all because of my family.

34:01.190 --> 34:03.094
This town.

34:04.698 --> 34:06.534
Dad...

34:08.137 --> 34:09.541
You're a Prescott.

34:09.574 --> 34:12.613
I am, and so are you.

34:14.450 --> 34:18.325
Your nana was proud to come
from such an illustrious family.

34:18.358 --> 34:21.397
Wrede Prescott was a great man.

34:21.430 --> 34:24.136
He built this whole place up
from nothing.

34:24.169 --> 34:26.374
It was just dirt,
patches of manure,

34:26.407 --> 34:29.113
and he turned this
into a thriving destination.

34:29.146 --> 34:32.119
People come here from all over
to see what he made.

34:32.152 --> 34:34.256
This is his legacy.

34:34.289 --> 34:36.562
And one day, Finn,

34:36.595 --> 34:38.699
this will all be yours.

34:38.732 --> 34:39.801
ERIN:
Oh, God.

34:42.239 --> 34:44.677
This all makes sense now.

34:45.713 --> 34:47.617
Why they took Jake, everything.

34:47.650 --> 34:49.320
What happened to Jake was
a terrible accident.

34:49.353 --> 34:52.861
No. It's the lake.

34:52.894 --> 34:55.165
It wants revenge.

34:55.198 --> 34:58.338
Jake died because of
what you've done,

34:58.371 --> 35:00.442
because of
what your family's done.

35:00.475 --> 35:02.179
You can't be serious.

35:02.212 --> 35:04.584
You're saying that-that-that
I'm somehow responsible

35:04.617 --> 35:06.187
for what happened to our son?

35:06.220 --> 35:07.557
Is that, is that
what I'm hearing from you?

35:07.590 --> 35:10.496
Of course you didn't want
any of this to happen,

35:10.529 --> 35:13.334
but it all makes sense now.

35:13.367 --> 35:17.911
Wrede Prescott hurt
a lot of people,

35:17.944 --> 35:21.350
and now they're angry at us.

35:21.383 --> 35:26.895
They took Jake because he's got
Prescott blood in his veins.

35:26.928 --> 35:30.636
Which means
they could come after me, too.

35:30.669 --> 35:33.843
I swear, Erin,
I almost understand

35:33.876 --> 35:35.345
why you'd fall
for something like this,

35:35.378 --> 35:36.715
but making our daughter
believe it?

35:36.748 --> 35:39.220
I mean, come on.
What the hell is wrong with you?

35:39.253 --> 35:41.625
No, she didn't make me
believe anything, Dad.

35:41.658 --> 35:42.894
All right?
This is the only thing

35:42.927 --> 35:44.196
that explains what happened.

35:44.229 --> 35:46.234
Enough! Fucking enough!

35:46.267 --> 35:47.504
(crickets chirping)

35:47.537 --> 35:49.206
Okay, look.

35:49.239 --> 35:50.910
We obviously have
a lot of things to work out.

35:50.943 --> 35:54.951
The first and most important
thing we need to do is go home.

35:54.984 --> 35:57.624

35:57.657 --> 36:00.630

36:00.663 --> 36:03.636
The crickets.

36:03.669 --> 36:05.606
Guys, let's get out of here.

be dead, too?
