18:55.360 --> 18:57.530
But I thought you ...

18:57.570 --> 18:59.990
I only carry one at a time.

19:28.960 --> 19:33.160
Welcome to the Wreckers, kid.
You did Bulkhead proud.

19:36.140 --> 19:40.210
Then why don't I feel any different?

19:46.150 --> 19:48.420
[ metal scraping ]

20:05.820 --> 20:10.850
- Miko, you okay?
- She's fine! Kid's a pro.

20:10.880 --> 20:14.230
- I wasn't talking to you.
- How is he?

20:14.260 --> 20:15.770
[ whirring, low beeping ]

20:16.180 --> 20:20.110
Bulkhead will survive.

20:21.040 --> 20:24.030
He may never be fully functional again.

20:29.020 --> 20:32.190
Miko, I don't think
it's wise for you ...

20:44.960 --> 20:49.580
I'm... not sure I want
to see Bulk right now.

20:49.650 --> 20:52.300
Not like this.

21:00.120 --> 21:02.820
I'm never leaving you again.

21:02.860 --> 21:05.040
[ cries ]

21:15.120 --> 21:20.110
- The Autobot did this?!
- No, my lord.

21:20.130 --> 21:23.580
It was... a human girl.
