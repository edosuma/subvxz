-I am Jor-EI, your father.

-Kandorian.

36:04.495 --> 36:06.281
You're lying.

36:06.747 --> 36:10.080
You have operatives all over the world
tracking aliens. You know.

36:10.251 --> 36:13.038
The only alien I know
is standing right in front of me.

[GASPS]

36:15.339 --> 36:18.251
Where's my father?
I wanna see him now.

36:18.759 --> 36:25.756
Clark, I have waited so long for you
to admit your true Kryptonian heritage.

36:26.475 --> 36:29.763
I always hoped you'd tell me
because you trusted me...

36:30.813 --> 36:33.270
...but I'll take what I can get.

36:34.609 --> 36:36.224
Where is he?

36:36.402 --> 36:38.939
-Tell me.
-Zod has him.

36:39.906 --> 36:42.067
Don't worry, Clark.

36:42.700 --> 36:45.783
I had a tracking device
put on Jor-El's clothes...

36:45.953 --> 36:47.454
...so we could locate him.

36:48.331 --> 36:49.787
You wanted Zod to ﬁnd him...

36:51.542 --> 36:53.783
...so you could ﬁnd the others.

36:53.961 --> 36:57.294
-You used my father as bait.
-Clark, I was just trying to protect you.

36:57.465 --> 36:58.796
[GASPS]

37:00.092 --> 37:01.923
Find him.

37:14.482 --> 37:15.938
He's at your farm.

37:27.411 --> 37:29.117
Jor-El?

37:36.504 --> 37:38.165
[GASPING]

37:38.381 --> 37:40.337
Who did this to you?

37:40.800 --> 37:41.835
I don't know.

37:43.386 --> 37:46.002
Okay. Hold on, I'll get you help.

37:48.641 --> 37:52.884
Kal-El, I'm so proud of you.

37:53.062 --> 37:55.269
So proud.

37:56.565 --> 37:59.932
Please stay. Don't go.

38:00.111 --> 38:02.147
I can save you.

38:03.364 --> 38:07.277
Save Zod.

38:09.412 --> 38:11.949
No. No!

38:29.056 --> 38:31.308
When Dad died,
I remembered thinking...

38:31.475 --> 38:35.809
...at least I'd have the memories
of being with him here on the farm.

38:36.731 --> 38:39.564
With Jor-EI being gone,
all I'm left with is....

38:39.734 --> 38:42.020
Empty feeling inside.

38:52.038 --> 38:55.280
I had so many questions
I wanted to ask him.

38:56.250 --> 38:58.536
Figure out who he really was.

38:58.711 --> 39:01.578
Seems to me like
you're a chip off the old block.

39:01.756 --> 39:06.090
After seeing how he saved our spunky
sidekick, I'd say you're both heroes.

39:09.013 --> 39:11.925
I'll never be able to live up
to everything he accomplished.

39:12.099 --> 39:13.600
I don't know.

39:15.603 --> 39:18.515
I don't think anyone wears
that super shield quite like you.

39:23.319 --> 39:27.107
Still, he sacriﬁced so much,
sending me to this planet.

39:28.032 --> 39:30.523
And he sacriﬁced himself again
to protect my secret.

39:31.452 --> 39:33.784
Of course he did, Clark.

39:34.955 --> 39:38.322
-You're his son.
-But he didn't have to die.

39:47.760 --> 39:50.422
I asked Chloe to scan the footage
she has from the farm.

39:50.596 --> 39:53.963
She's gonna use the Watchtower
to ﬁgure out what really happened.

39:56.310 --> 39:58.471
Look, um, ahem...

39:58.938 --> 40:02.977
...I know you and I haven't always seen
eye-to-eye lately, but, uh...

40:06.195 --> 40:09.653
...I got your back. Always.

40:11.575 --> 40:13.156
Good.

40:14.286 --> 40:17.824
Because I'm gonna need your help
to ﬁgure out who killed my father...

40:18.332 --> 40:20.493
...and bring him to justice.

40:30.970 --> 40:33.211
Jor-El, you lied to me.

40:34.515 --> 40:37.973
Looks like you had another reason
for coming to Smallville.

40:59.415 --> 41:01.371
I'm
sorry

41:04.170 --> 41:06.627
I can't give you what you wanted.

41:07.840 --> 41:10.206
I can't save Zod.

41:14.472 --> 41:16.713
You might remember him as a friend...

41:17.183 --> 41:19.720
...but I know what he becomes.
