I guess I'll cancel the shoot.

06:19.438 --> 06:22.196
I better go tell everyone
and return all the candy.

06:22.216 --> 06:25.291
Gene, you are literally taking
candy from babies.

06:25.386 --> 06:27.277
-These babies!
-Yeah!

07:15.710 --> 07:17.327
Just checking, we don't
normally bring stuff home

07:17.420 --> 07:18.586
that people leave
in the restaurant, do we?

07:18.605 --> 07:19.921
No, Tina, we don't.

07:20.165 --> 07:22.423
But your mom is convinced
that something weird is going on

07:22.443 --> 07:23.942
because the man
who owns the briefcase

07:24.169 --> 07:27.170
ate food quietly at
our restaurant and then he left.

07:27.189 --> 07:28.521
His name is Billy Bandana.

07:28.615 --> 07:30.507
His number's disconnected.
It's weird.

07:30.525 --> 07:32.509
It is kind of fun to imagine
what could be in there.

07:32.527 --> 07:34.344
Human hands
from all of his enemies

07:34.362 --> 07:36.029
in the briefcase business world.

07:36.123 --> 07:38.957
-Ooh.
-Or a bunch
of business bandanas?

07:39.108 --> 07:40.292
For a working man on the go.

07:40.443 --> 07:42.368
Maybe. Whatever it is,
it's packed so tight,

07:42.521 --> 07:44.329
-it doesn't make a sound.
-Like Dad's boobs

07:44.481 --> 07:46.356
-in that one sweater.
-(groans softly)

07:46.449 --> 07:47.190
(doorbell rings)

07:47.283 --> 07:48.783
Hey, guys. Come on in.

07:48.877 --> 07:51.211
Rupa, Julie and Peter Pescadero
are already here

07:51.363 --> 07:53.213
getting their "Locker Love" on.

07:53.365 --> 07:54.380
-Hey.
-Yeah, we are.
-Hi!

07:54.533 --> 07:55.215
Gene! Buddy!

07:55.383 --> 07:56.382
-You're here!
-Mm-hmm.

07:56.535 --> 07:57.867
Why don't we duck into my studio

07:57.869 --> 07:59.811
and record
the last line of the song?

08:00.038 --> 08:01.554
(sighs)
Okay.

08:01.707 --> 08:03.723
First, a quick warm-up.
Let's stretch out that voice.

08:03.817 --> 08:06.543
♪<i> Open pit barbecue sauce.</i> ♪

08:06.561 --> 08:07.393
Now you do it.

08:07.470 --> 08:08.561
No, thanks. I'm all warmed up.

08:08.714 --> 08:11.231
Yeah, he barbecue sauced
all the way here.

08:11.383 --> 08:12.882
-(groaning)
-Now go knock 'em dead, Gene,

08:13.051 --> 08:14.475
while you're still saucy!

08:14.495 --> 08:17.237
Okay, I've already recorded
a guide track,

08:17.313 --> 08:18.888
so I'll just play it back
and you sing it

08:18.907 --> 08:20.724
-exactly the way I did.
-Okay.

Okay, but not
too much computer magic though,

08:43.006 --> 08:45.415
because then it sounds,
you know...

08:45.433 --> 08:46.841
Yeah. Computer magic is great.

08:46.935 --> 08:49.252
Okay, let's just do this
one word at a time.

08:49.271 --> 08:51.437

08:56.261 --> 08:57.869
-Hi, Teddy.
-I had a great idea.

08:58.062 --> 09:00.372
I got this old briefcase
from the thrift store.

09:00.599 --> 09:01.355
(groans)
Why?

09:01.375 --> 09:02.932
I filled it with printer paper,

09:02.951 --> 09:04.358
six pens, a calculator,

09:04.378 --> 09:06.394
a bunch of paper clips,
a granola bar

09:06.396 --> 09:07.771
and a couple of floppy disks.

09:07.789 --> 09:09.196
Just basic business stuff.

09:09.216 --> 09:11.216
-Mm.
-All right. Okay.

09:11.443 --> 09:12.942
So I was thinking
we lift this briefcase

09:12.961 --> 09:16.112
and Billy Bandana's briefcase
and see if they feel the same.

09:16.131 --> 09:17.130
Ooh, that's so smart!

09:17.299 --> 09:18.372
-It-It's not.
-It is, Bob.

09:18.392 --> 09:19.874
Now, where's his briefcase?

09:19.893 --> 09:21.542
And here you go.

09:21.620 --> 09:24.229
Wow.
They definitely feel different.

09:24.380 --> 09:25.880
-(gasps) They do!
-I knew it.

09:25.899 --> 09:27.715
It's not normal business stuff
in there.

09:27.809 --> 09:30.068
It's something else.
Something mysterious

09:30.295 --> 09:31.978
-and maybe supernatural.
-Definitely.

09:32.130 --> 09:33.905
Let me feel.
I mean, isn't it more likely

09:34.057 --> 09:35.740
he just has a different amount
of business stuff

09:35.967 --> 09:38.410
in his briefcase? Because this
is the least scientific test

09:38.561 --> 09:41.805
that anyone's ever done
in history. No offense.

09:41.823 --> 09:43.915
If this was a movie,
you'd get killed first, Bob.

09:44.067 --> 09:45.566
-W-Wait, what?
-Yeah. Skeptical guy.

09:45.660 --> 09:47.477
For your own good,
you should hang back.

09:47.646 --> 09:50.422
Okay, so we narrowed it down
to something supernatural.

09:50.573 --> 09:52.740
Or, like Louise said,
a bunch of human hands.

09:52.834 --> 09:54.984
Ooh, human hands.
That makes sense.

09:55.003 --> 09:57.337
Or... what we're all thinkin':
plutonium.

09:57.489 --> 09:59.764
Right. I wish I hadn't sold
my Geiger counter.

09:59.841 --> 10:01.324
-We got to open it!
-No.

10:01.343 --> 10:03.084
We need to know
if there's plutonium in here!

10:03.178 --> 10:05.178
-There-There's no plutonium.
-Now that you say it,

10:05.330 --> 10:06.605
it really does feel
like human hands.

10:06.756 --> 10:09.090
But there's no blood.
Maybe they're in baggies?

10:09.109 --> 10:10.166
No, no, no.
(groans)

10:10.185 --> 10:12.093
(sighs)
You're gone.

10:12.187 --> 10:13.594
Gene! Good, you're all finished.

10:13.614 --> 10:16.506
I think we finally landed
on some outfits for the video.

10:16.599 --> 10:17.857
This is mine.

10:17.951 --> 10:19.859
-(scoffs) It's amazing.
-(gasps) It's gorgeous.

10:19.953 --> 10:23.788
-And that's yours.
-The same old thing every
hot boy wears in every video.

10:23.940 --> 10:26.349
Great. Hey, what if I'm,
like, a pirate?

10:26.368 --> 10:29.185
A locker pirate?
Or a nice old nanny

10:29.278 --> 10:31.112
who's trying
to Mrs. Doubtfire you?

10:31.131 --> 10:32.947
Gene, you're being silly.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.357
(chuckles):
Gene! Buddy!

10:34.376 --> 10:35.525
Candy!

10:35.543 --> 10:37.377
Fine. It's great.
The costumes are great.

10:37.471 --> 10:39.804
Yay! Come on, Gene. I'll walk
you through the storyboard.

10:40.031 --> 10:41.622
You know how to do
flavor fingers, right?

10:41.642 --> 10:43.475
You mean the dance
that everyone has done

10:43.551 --> 10:45.143
in every music video
for the last five years?

10:45.370 --> 10:46.811
-Yes!
-Does not get old.

10:46.963 --> 10:48.388
Okay, so in the beginning,
we start out

10:48.482 --> 10:51.057
with some flavor fingers
and then I blow you a kiss.

10:51.209 --> 10:52.299
-(slurps, spits)
-Aah!

10:52.319 --> 10:54.301
Maybe blow it,
don't blowhole it?

10:54.379 --> 10:56.971
Oops, sorry.
My retainer gathers saliva.

10:56.990 --> 10:58.639
I'll drain it
before I blow the kiss.

10:58.659 --> 10:59.716
Great.

10:59.809 --> 11:01.809
LINDA:
All right, come on. Let's think.

11:01.828 --> 11:04.053
What would a guy named Billy
Bandana pick for a combination?

11:04.147 --> 11:07.740
Probably something really cool,
like 1999.

11:07.834 --> 11:08.833
Mm... Nope.

11:09.060 --> 11:10.168
Damn you, Billy Bandana.

11:10.319 --> 11:11.836
You guys really need to stop.

11:11.988 --> 11:14.063
Oh, come on, Bob.
What would<i> you</i> expect

11:14.082 --> 11:15.415
if you left your briefcase
in a restaurant?

11:15.567 --> 11:17.658
I would expect them
to put it in a safe place

11:17.678 --> 11:18.826
and not mess with it.

11:18.845 --> 11:20.512
If I locked it,
I locked it for a reason.

11:20.588 --> 11:22.347
Well, what reason is that,
Business Bob?

11:22.574 --> 11:24.832
Yeah! What are you hiding,
Business Bob?

11:24.851 --> 11:26.759
Just, uh, an idea I have

11:26.912 --> 11:29.854
that is going to revolutionize
the industry I work in.

11:30.006 --> 11:32.415
All carefully typed out
on business paper.

11:32.434 --> 11:34.693
What? Why are you keeping it
in your briefcase?

11:34.920 --> 11:36.419
Keep that in a safe
at the office.

11:36.512 --> 11:38.846
Yeah, Bob.
That's not responsible.

11:38.865 --> 11:40.440
'Cause I was gonna submit it
to the board

11:40.592 --> 11:42.516
at the next big meeting,
and I hope it's safe

11:42.536 --> 11:44.260
at the restaurant I left it at!

11:44.279 --> 11:47.354
(rhythmic grunting)

11:47.449 --> 11:48.614
That's great, people.

11:48.767 --> 11:50.950
I totally get
why everyone does this dance.

11:51.027 --> 11:52.936
If it ain't broke, don't fix it.

11:52.954 --> 11:53.953
Okay, one more time.

11:54.105 --> 11:55.121
(grunting)

11:55.215 --> 11:56.606
(quietly):
You're doing great, Gene.

11:56.624 --> 11:58.216
Yeah. Especially
if you don't look at your face.

11:58.367 --> 11:59.867
I don't know
if I can take this much longer.

11:59.886 --> 12:01.219
It's all so unoriginal.

12:01.446 --> 12:03.370
Just hang in there.
Once we get to that shoot,

12:03.390 --> 12:04.614
we're in Candy City.

12:04.632 --> 12:06.433
Also, I think
Courtney really needs this.

12:06.542 --> 12:07.892
-And by "Courtney," I mean "me."
-COURTNEY: Ow. Ow.

12:08.044 --> 12:09.452
-And by "this," I mean "candy."
-(grunting)

12:09.454 --> 12:11.730
Aw, fine.
I guess it can't get any worse.

12:11.881 --> 12:13.790
Okay!
I finished mixing the song.

12:13.808 --> 12:18.461
♪<i> This might be a shocker</i>
<i>but I can't resist her locker</i> ♪

12:18.480 --> 12:19.979
♪<i> Locker love.</i> ♪

12:20.073 --> 12:22.482
-Wow.
-It sounds just like
every other song I love.

12:22.650 --> 12:24.225
I hate this,
I hate this, I hate this.

12:24.244 --> 12:26.060
-What'd you say, Gene?
-Nothing. I love it.

12:26.079 --> 12:27.912
I know, right? I love it, too!

12:28.064 --> 12:29.914
Okay, let's go shoot a video!

12:30.141 --> 12:31.666
-Yeah!
-(Gene whimpers)

12:35.663 --> 12:36.921
Okay, here's the snack table,
in case anyone gets

12:37.148 --> 12:38.481
a touch of the nibbles.

12:38.500 --> 12:39.924
Oh, look at that.
I guess I could go for a snack.

12:40.151 --> 12:42.318
I never even thought
about eating Fudge Flings

12:42.411 --> 12:44.095
and Cinnamony Crickets
in the same bite.

12:44.247 --> 12:47.081
But since they're both here,
I might as well go for it.

12:47.100 --> 12:49.509
So cute. You look like that boy
in that one thing.

12:49.661 --> 12:51.344
And like that other boy
in that other thing.

12:51.496 --> 12:53.554
(groans) These skinny jeans
are too skinny.

12:53.607 --> 12:55.106
COURTNEY:
Those aren't skinny jeans, Gene.

12:55.333 --> 12:56.941
-They're slimmy jimmy jeans.
-Aah!

12:57.168 --> 12:58.592
That's a lot of makeup.

12:58.612 --> 13:00.427
Only in real life.
It'll look normal on the screen.

13:00.522 --> 13:02.505
-Right, Daddy?
-I promise, honey.

13:02.524 --> 13:04.524
I've done this before.
I mean, I've written jingles

13:04.618 --> 13:06.767
that were used in commercials
where actors wear makeup,

13:06.861 --> 13:08.361
-so... same thing.
-See?

13:08.530 --> 13:10.789
Well, I'm gonna grab a Fudge
Fling to keep my energy up.

13:10.940 --> 13:13.016
No candy for us
until we're finished, Gene.

13:13.034 --> 13:14.275
The sugar is bad for our voices.

13:14.294 --> 13:15.535
But we're lip-synching.

13:15.629 --> 13:17.796
-It can still affect
our performance!
-Bah!

13:17.872 --> 13:19.446
Okay, in this first shot,

13:19.466 --> 13:21.374
Courtney,
you look longingly at Gene,

13:21.526 --> 13:23.693
and, Gene,
you lean against the lockers

13:23.711 --> 13:25.211
looking gorgeous
and unattainable

13:25.363 --> 13:26.879
and also like, "I'm cool."

13:27.032 --> 13:28.214
Uh, like this?

13:28.366 --> 13:30.049
-Cooler.
-Like... this?

13:30.201 --> 13:31.217
-Cooler.
-This?

13:31.369 --> 13:33.294
Whoa! Pull it back, Fonzie.

13:33.371 --> 13:34.979
Just kidding. That's perfect.

13:35.131 --> 13:35.980
Let's roll!

13:36.207 --> 13:37.223
<i> (toilet flushes)</i>

13:37.300 --> 13:39.375
Hey! There you are!

13:39.377 --> 13:40.485
Everything go okay in there?

13:40.654 --> 13:44.155
Yeah. I mean, as far
as things go, it was fine.

13:44.307 --> 13:45.973
Can I, um, get by you?

13:45.992 --> 13:47.808
Oh, am I in your way?

13:47.902 --> 13:50.053
Yes. You are standing
in front of the door.

13:50.146 --> 13:51.830
Oh. So I am. But, hey, uh,

13:51.981 --> 13:53.406
don't you need to go cook
or something?

13:53.558 --> 13:55.074
It's Bob's Burgers,
not Bob Walks Through Doors,

13:55.226 --> 13:56.334
right?
(chuckles nervously)

13:56.485 --> 13:58.319
Linda, why don't you want me
to go out there?

13:58.413 --> 13:59.896
Uh, come on, let's make out.
Kiss me.

13:59.989 --> 14:01.339
-(grunting)
Lick it like you like it.
-Stop it.

14:01.490 --> 14:02.899
-Lick it like you like it.
-No. Get off.

14:02.917 --> 14:04.400
-(babbling)
-(gasps) Teddy!
-Oh!

14:04.493 --> 14:05.902
This is, uh, mine!

14:05.995 --> 14:07.661
The one that I got
at the thrift store, rem--

14:07.681 --> 14:10.073
I'm just fixing it up, making
sure that everything's good.

14:10.166 --> 14:11.015
Yep. All good.

14:11.167 --> 14:12.666
It says "Billy Bandana" on it.

14:12.686 --> 14:15.411
Oh! Did I get them mixed up?
How embarrassing.

14:15.471 --> 14:17.504
Come on, Bob.
He's almost got it open.

14:17.599 --> 14:19.190
And why were you so fast
in the bathroom?

14:19.417 --> 14:20.433
You usually take so long.

14:20.585 --> 14:22.193
-Sometimes I'm fast.
-Oh, really?

14:22.420 --> 14:24.103
Why is this about me?
Teddy, stop!

14:24.197 --> 14:25.179
You're gonna mess it up.

14:25.198 --> 14:27.090
I... might have messed it up.

14:27.108 --> 14:28.774
-Wh-What?
-Well, you startled me

14:28.869 --> 14:30.702
when you barged in,
and I may have damaged the hinge

14:30.853 --> 14:32.595
-a little bit a lot.
-Teddy, no.

14:32.614 --> 14:34.372
It's Linda's fault
for being a terrible lookout.

14:34.599 --> 14:36.875
Don't blame me.
Blame Bobby Quick-Poops.

14:37.026 --> 14:38.284
Damn it, Bobby Quick-Poops!

14:38.378 --> 14:40.620
JULIE:
Oh, my God. That is so cool.

14:40.772 --> 14:43.214
-Yeah. It's so music video-y.
-(Gene groans)

14:43.441 --> 14:45.216
It's like a Frankenstein
of every other video.

14:45.443 --> 14:47.051
But less interesting
than Frankenstein.

14:47.203 --> 14:48.386
I can't take this anymore.

14:48.613 --> 14:50.221
This is going great.
What do you think, Dad?

14:50.448 --> 14:52.240
I think
this video has to sneeze.

14:52.267 --> 14:53.966
Because it's gonna go viral!

14:54.060 --> 14:56.728
Yes! Okay! Everyone,
let's set up for the last shot!

14:56.879 --> 14:59.380
Gene and I do the flavor fingers
and harmonize

14:59.474 --> 15:01.474
while everyone flavor fingers
behind us!

15:01.568 --> 15:03.793
-Let's do this!
-(whoops)
-All right!

15:03.811 --> 15:06.053
(whoops) I am pumped!
Yes! Yes! Yes!

15:06.072 --> 15:07.980
Ready for this, Gene?
You feeling it, buddy?

15:08.133 --> 15:09.632
-Ow!
-Sorry. So much sugar.

15:09.725 --> 15:10.983
Let's just do it fast.

15:11.060 --> 15:12.911
That's the spirit, buddy!

15:13.062 --> 15:14.228
(whooping loudly)

15:14.247 --> 15:15.914
TEDDY:
Eh, I'm having trouble

15:16.065 --> 15:17.916
getting this one hinge back on,
Bobby.

15:18.067 --> 15:19.100
-Eh.
-Well, try harder, Teddy.

15:19.235 --> 15:20.643
I must have stripped a screw.

15:20.662 --> 15:22.478
You really shouldn't scare
people like that, you know?

15:22.497 --> 15:24.480
(groans)
We are definitely gonna be known

15:24.499 --> 15:26.649
as the restaurant that rifles
through your belongings.

15:26.668 --> 15:29.076
Or the restaurant where
they found all those hands.

15:29.137 --> 15:30.670
(strained): Don't panic, Bob.
I just got to give this

15:30.822 --> 15:33.097
a little push.
(grunting)

15:33.249 --> 15:34.991
-Ah. Uh-oh.
-BOB: Great.

15:35.084 --> 15:36.509
(forced):
Oh, no!

15:36.661 --> 15:38.494
Well, we might as well take
a peek since the hinge fell off.

15:38.513 --> 15:40.846
It didn't fall off.
Teddy pried it off!

15:40.941 --> 15:42.682
-Stop it, Lin!
-I can almost see.

15:42.776 --> 15:44.275
What's in it? What's inside?

15:44.427 --> 15:46.093
BOB:
Stop pulling it apart.
You'll pop the lock

15:46.112 --> 15:47.170
-off the front...
-Bob, shh!

15:47.263 --> 15:49.096
We're in too deep!

15:49.115 --> 15:50.615
What the...

15:50.766 --> 15:51.507
<i> Walnuts?</i>

15:51.676 --> 15:52.766
-Walnuts?
-Let me see.

15:52.860 --> 15:54.953
There's got to be
something else in there.

15:55.180 --> 15:56.454
Nope. Just one more walnut.

15:56.605 --> 15:58.939
Huh. So it isn't
a plutonium thing

15:58.959 --> 16:00.199
or a hand killer thing.

16:00.351 --> 16:02.368
Just a man
who really enjoys his nuts.

16:02.462 --> 16:03.610
Well, you were right, Bob.

16:03.630 --> 16:05.521
Nothing dark or mysterious here.

16:05.540 --> 16:07.448
Are you kidding?
This is terrifying.

16:07.467 --> 16:09.208
Who would carry
a locked briefcase

16:09.360 --> 16:11.452
with nothing in it but walnuts?

16:11.471 --> 16:14.030
Maybe he's a walnut salesman
and these are his samples?

16:14.048 --> 16:15.364
You ever think of that?

16:15.366 --> 16:16.866
This guy is
definitely a serial killer.

16:16.959 --> 16:18.884
Eh, seems a little far-fetched,
Bob.

16:18.979 --> 16:19.978
It's just walnuts.

16:20.129 --> 16:21.295
Teddy, quick, can you fix this?

16:21.389 --> 16:22.981
I-I think I've got some screws
in my truck.

16:23.132 --> 16:24.390
-I'll go look.
-(gasps)

16:24.542 --> 16:25.650
-(door opens, bell tinkles)
-Linda, don't eat them.

16:25.801 --> 16:26.876
What?

16:26.969 --> 16:27.986

you were a little out of step,
but it wasn't that bad.

17:00.503 --> 17:02.745
It's finger flavor, step
and finger flavor, step,

17:02.914 --> 17:04.580
not finger, step, flavor, step.

17:04.599 --> 17:05.748
Not that! This!

17:05.767 --> 17:07.416
-This is awful!
-What?

17:07.510 --> 17:09.676
This song! This video!
All of it!

17:09.696 --> 17:11.437
(crying)

17:11.639 --> 17:13.013
What the fudge, Gene?

17:13.033 --> 17:14.757
Um... 15-minute crew break?

17:14.759 --> 17:17.452
-Anyone up
for some Cram Jammers?
-TINA and LOUISE: Me!

17:22.042 --> 17:23.282
Courtney! Honey! Court-Court!

17:23.434 --> 17:25.043
-So, that was a little...
-Really harsh.

17:25.194 --> 17:27.953
It's just-- I can't believe
how bad this all is.

17:28.106 --> 17:29.380
I think
everything's been amazing.

17:29.457 --> 17:31.031
I feel like I could rip
the lockers off the wall!

17:31.125 --> 17:34.201
But, I mean, Gene,
Courtney's your friend, right?

17:34.295 --> 17:36.220
-Yeah.
-And doing this video

17:36.372 --> 17:38.056
-makes her happy, right?
-Somehow.

17:38.207 --> 17:40.558
Well, sometimes you do things
you might not really like

17:40.785 --> 17:43.061
for people you do like
because<i> they</i> like it

17:43.288 --> 17:45.063
and it makes<i> them</i> happy.

17:45.290 --> 17:47.548
Yeah, like when Tina and I
play Fossil Friends with you.

17:47.642 --> 17:49.975
What? You don't like burying
the bones after we have chicken

17:50.128 --> 17:52.128
and then pretending
we're finding fossils?

17:52.221 --> 17:52.978
I mean, it's fine.

17:53.073 --> 17:54.146
It's a little nasty.

17:54.299 --> 17:55.798
(sighs)
I guess I see your point.

17:55.891 --> 17:57.408
About Courtney,
not the chicken bones.

17:57.560 --> 17:58.317
We're still doing that.

17:58.469 --> 17:59.802
I can't find Courtney anywhere.

17:59.821 --> 18:01.637
-Let's all split up
and look for her.
-On it!

18:01.656 --> 18:04.265
You better hope we can find her
and finish this, Gene.

18:04.267 --> 18:06.158
Or should I say "Mean Gene"?

18:06.252 --> 18:07.310
Because you're mean.

18:07.328 --> 18:09.403
I think I know where she is.

18:09.480 --> 18:11.163
I got all the walnuts back in,

18:11.257 --> 18:12.924
but I can't quite get it shut.

18:13.075 --> 18:14.333
I think
the duct tape was a bad idea.

18:14.427 --> 18:16.094
Oh, my God!
He's here! That's him!

18:16.321 --> 18:18.337
-He's coming in!
-Put the briefcase back
in the booth!

18:18.489 --> 18:20.172
Oh, my God. He's gonna kill us.

18:20.325 --> 18:22.082
Calm down, Bob. Act natural.

18:22.102 --> 18:23.750
I'm just a guy enjoying a joke.

18:23.770 --> 18:25.103
(laughing)

18:25.254 --> 18:26.846
Welp, I got to go! Bye!

18:26.940 --> 18:28.088
-What?!
-(laughs)

18:28.108 --> 18:29.607
Never mind! I'll stay.

18:29.834 --> 18:31.609
And everything's fine.
This is a restaurant.

18:31.760 --> 18:32.810
Hi!

18:33.113 --> 18:35.671
Welcome to Bob's Burgers.
Uh, wh-what can I get ya?

18:35.690 --> 18:38.007
I don't know if you remember me.
I was in here yesterday,

18:38.100 --> 18:40.192
and I think I may have left
my briefcase.

18:40.345 --> 18:42.027
-Huh. Doesn't ring a bell.
-There it is.

18:42.180 --> 18:44.530
Oh!<i> That</i> briefcase!

18:44.624 --> 18:47.700
Uh, hey! Um,
I tried calling the number,

18:47.852 --> 18:49.276
uh, that was on the briefcase,

18:49.295 --> 18:50.536
but it was no longer in service.

18:50.630 --> 18:53.856
So, you know, no-no reason
to be upset with us.

18:53.875 --> 18:55.191
It looks a little different.

18:55.284 --> 18:56.467
(stammers)
Does it?

18:56.636 --> 18:59.637
Oh. Well, a-a bunch of kids
were in here earlier.

18:59.864 --> 19:01.547
-Rowdy teens.
-Some of 'em were...

19:01.699 --> 19:02.789
using curse words.

19:02.884 --> 19:04.216
They were duct-taping
everything.

19:04.310 --> 19:06.218
Uh, looks like they got
your briefcase.

19:06.371 --> 19:07.645
You know teens
and their duct tape.

19:07.796 --> 19:08.980
-Ugh, God.
-Oh. Yeah.

19:09.131 --> 19:11.315
They-they-they-they did get
a little on there.

19:11.467 --> 19:12.817
-(chuckles) Yeah.
-(crunch)

19:12.968 --> 19:14.968
-What was that?
-What was what?

19:15.062 --> 19:16.061
That crackling noise.

19:16.214 --> 19:18.381
Sounded like you stepped on a...

19:18.399 --> 19:19.715
-A walnut?
-Maybe.

19:19.734 --> 19:22.735
Um, I wouldn't know
what that would sound like.

19:22.887 --> 19:25.329
Would... you?

19:26.407 --> 19:27.147
No.

19:27.167 --> 19:29.149
Okay, then. Yeah.

19:29.243 --> 19:31.076
Wait, nobody has
any more questions?

19:31.229 --> 19:33.087
-(high-pitched): Nope.
-I'm good.

19:35.341 --> 19:36.674
That was freaky.

19:36.901 --> 19:39.084
Now we'll never know what's
going on with the walnuts.

19:39.237 --> 19:41.070
I think that's for the best.

19:41.088 --> 19:43.406
I feel like we were just
in the presence of death.

19:43.424 --> 19:45.741
Aw, Bob.
Do you need a hug, sweetie?

19:45.760 --> 19:46.575
No.

19:46.594 --> 19:48.093
Okay. Yeah. Maybe I do.

19:48.188 --> 19:50.188
There, there.
Everyone's safe now.

19:50.339 --> 19:51.914
I could go for one of those.

19:51.933 --> 19:53.916
Oh. Um, okay.

19:53.918 --> 19:55.601
-(grunts)
-Oh.

19:55.753 --> 19:57.177
Courtney? Courtney?

19:57.271 --> 19:58.812
-COURTNEY: No.
-Come on, Courtney.

19:58.923 --> 20:01.014
-Let me talk to you.
-How did you know I was here?

20:01.034 --> 20:03.201
You always say this is
where you wish you lived

20:03.428 --> 20:04.535
so that you'd
always sound amazing.

20:04.762 --> 20:05.945
Yes, the acoustics.

20:06.113 --> 20:08.372
I think Dolly Parton records
all her songs in slides.

20:08.599 --> 20:10.041
That's why she has
an amusement park.

20:10.192 --> 20:11.951
I guess it makes sense
that you'd know I'd be here,

20:12.119 --> 20:13.953
because... we used to be friends
and all.

20:14.105 --> 20:15.237
We are friends, Courtney.

20:15.289 --> 20:16.714
And I'm sorry for what I said.

20:16.941 --> 20:19.032
It's just...
your song is not quite...

20:19.052 --> 20:20.125
my cup of tea.

20:20.278 --> 20:21.719
I like tea that doesn't,
you know,

20:21.946 --> 20:23.462
taste like everyone else's tea.

20:23.556 --> 20:27.374
But you like tea that's, like,
the most number one-selling tea.

20:27.393 --> 20:29.560
You're talking about tea a lot.
Are you thirsty?

20:29.712 --> 20:31.378
A little.
But what I should've realized

20:31.397 --> 20:33.397
is you do like that kind of tea.

20:33.566 --> 20:34.790
It makes you happy.

20:34.809 --> 20:36.234
And I want you to be happy.

20:36.402 --> 20:37.643
-And...
-Yeah?

20:37.720 --> 20:40.053
What do you say
we go finish this mama-jama?

20:40.073 --> 20:41.072
Thanks, Gene.

20:41.299 --> 20:42.815
-Is my makeup streaking?
-No...

20:42.909 --> 20:45.484
Maybe you should get a little
touch-up on the... face part.
