00:02.170 --> 00:03.588
<i>Previously on</i>
Gotham...

00:03.755 --> 00:04.881
<i>You can still run.</i>

00:05.048 --> 00:06.383
<i>Find Lee, have a life.</i>

00:06.549 --> 00:08.134
- I have to clear my name.
- But how?

00:08.301 --> 00:10.136
You're sane.
It would be unethical

00:10.303 --> 00:11.846
and illegal to keep you confined.

00:12.013 --> 00:13.890
If you keep releasing lunatics,

00:14.057 --> 00:16.267
<i>you're going to get a bad reputation.</i>

00:16.434 --> 00:18.103
- Matches Malone.
- We've met before?

00:18.269 --> 00:20.271
You killed my parents. Who hired you?

00:20.438 --> 00:21.648
You'll never know their name.

00:22.732 --> 00:23.733
Bruce.

00:23.900 --> 00:24.901
He's in there.

00:30.031 --> 00:31.116
<i>Hello, Kristen.</i>

00:32.701 --> 00:33.827
How did you become this?

00:34.119 --> 00:35.328
This is who I am.

00:35.495 --> 00:37.789
That's what made it so easy to frame you.

00:37.956 --> 00:39.207
<i>Drop the gun!</i>

00:44.421 --> 00:45.422
Oh, crud.

00:45.588 --> 00:46.881
So, when are you coming back to work?

00:47.132 --> 00:49.759
I promised Bruce Wayne
I'd solve his parents' murder.

00:49.926 --> 00:51.010
I have to do that first.

00:51.177 --> 00:53.138
The Wayne case is closed, Jim.
The perp is dead.

00:53.304 --> 00:55.140
<i>But who hired him?
I need to find out.</i>

00:55.849 --> 00:57.016
Good morning, Victor.

00:57.183 --> 00:58.226
How is it I'm not dead?

00:58.393 --> 01:00.228
Anything above freezing will kill you.

01:00.395 --> 01:03.148
<i>But never fear,
you won't be locked in there forever.</i>

01:03.523 --> 01:07.068
<i>You do know that Mr. Lucius Fox
fixed your old man's computer?</i>

01:07.235 --> 01:10.321
But I will not have you put that
little girl's life in danger.

01:10.488 --> 01:12.323
It's either the work or it's her.

01:12.657 --> 01:14.451
- I'm not going back.
- What?

01:14.617 --> 01:15.618
My place is here.

01:15.785 --> 01:17.078
Have a great life, Bruce Wayne.

01:21.583 --> 01:22.625
Hi, Jim.

01:27.297 --> 01:29.299
Hands up. Hands up!

01:29.466 --> 01:30.717
Okay. Look.

01:31.342 --> 01:32.343
Better?

01:33.386 --> 01:34.512
Inside.

01:35.638 --> 01:37.140
Keep them up. Face the wall.

01:40.810 --> 01:43.188
What are you doing here?
You're supposed to be in Arkham.

01:43.354 --> 01:44.898
And you're supposed to be in Blackgate.

01:45.064 --> 01:48.026
I cleared my name. I'll ask you again.
What are you doing here?

01:49.277 --> 01:50.361
I was released.

01:51.780 --> 01:52.989
Call them. You'll see.

01:54.199 --> 01:56.785
I'm telling the truth. It's what I do now.

01:58.077 --> 01:59.120
That's hard to believe.

01:59.704 --> 02:00.705
Which part?

02:00.872 --> 02:04.209
I swear to God, after the day I've had,
I have no problem shooting you.

02:04.876 --> 02:06.002
Hey, look, I believe you.

02:09.923 --> 02:11.549
Look, when I came out of the coma,

02:12.550 --> 02:17.931
the memories I had were horrifying,
like waking up from a nightmare.

02:18.807 --> 02:22.644
But the person who did those things,
that's not me.

02:27.106 --> 02:30.068
So they released you, just like that?

02:30.693 --> 02:32.403
Well, not right away.

02:32.570 --> 02:36.407
I mean, I had some issues
to work through, obviously.

02:37.283 --> 02:40.411
But yes, I'm better, Jim.

02:42.789 --> 02:43.915
I'm totally sane.

02:46.584 --> 02:47.710
I really am.

02:51.172 --> 02:52.382
I'm happy for you.

02:54.342 --> 02:55.426
Please, go.

02:56.678 --> 02:58.012
You don't believe me, do you?

02:58.471 --> 02:59.931
Frankly, I don't care.

03:01.850 --> 03:03.810
- What? And that's it?
- I have work to do.

03:06.896 --> 03:10.066
The Lady. You're investigating
the Wayne murder, huh?

03:10.692 --> 03:13.069
I've heard of her.
You think she's involved?

03:13.611 --> 03:14.946
'Cause I could help you with this.

03:16.447 --> 03:17.490
No, thanks.

03:17.657 --> 03:19.784
Okay, well, maybe
it was a mistake to come,

03:19.951 --> 03:21.911
but listen, could you just
do one more thing for me?

03:23.663 --> 03:24.873
Could you say my name?

03:27.500 --> 03:28.710
Goodbye, Barbara.

03:41.347 --> 03:42.515
Hey, Harvey.

03:44.726 --> 03:46.185
Jim will catch you up.

03:50.148 --> 03:51.316
Jim!

03:52.400 --> 03:53.401
Jim!

03:59.240 --> 04:01.117
You've been at it all night, Master Bruce.

04:02.076 --> 04:03.870
I need to try
and get some food down your neck.

04:04.162 --> 04:05.622
Do I smell sausage?

04:05.997 --> 04:09.250
Chipolatas, dear Mr. Fox.
I've prepared a full English upstairs.

04:09.626 --> 04:12.962
I have no idea if that's a "yes,"
but I'm starving. Let's eat.

04:13.338 --> 04:15.006
I think I found something.

04:15.381 --> 04:17.842
Your father's files are still running
through the decryption program.

04:18.009 --> 04:20.219
It could take weeks
before we know what we have.

04:20.386 --> 04:22.472
Yes, but his calendar
was only password protected.

04:23.348 --> 04:24.682
It was "Bruce," just like the lock.

04:24.891 --> 04:26.017
<i>Here, the week of his murder,</i>

04:26.643 --> 04:28.686
<i>he was supposed to meet a woman
named Karen Jennings</i>

04:28.853 --> 04:30.897
about something called Pinewood Farms.

04:31.481 --> 04:35.318
Oh, Pinewood Farms?
Sounds, uh, rather quaint.

04:35.485 --> 04:36.694
Or not.

04:36.861 --> 04:40.907
<i>Most of Wayne Enterprises' black op
programs had code names like that.</i>

04:41.240 --> 04:46.037
Running Brook, Windy Ridge.
A bland name covering up a nasty business.

04:46.746 --> 04:49.374
This could be what my father
was investigating when he was killed.

04:50.208 --> 04:53.544
I think we might be getting a tad ahead
of ourselves here, Master Bruce.

04:53.711 --> 04:57.632
I mean, how covert could it possibly be
if it's on your old man's calendar?

04:57.799 --> 04:59.717
I'll run Karen's name through HR
when I get into work,

04:59.884 --> 05:01.052
<i>see if there's even a connection.</i>

05:01.219 --> 05:02.470
My father had her address.

05:02.762 --> 05:03.805
She lives somewhere
right outside the city.

05:03.972 --> 05:07.517
I think we should just wait and see what
Mr. Fox comes up with first, Master Bruce.

05:07.684 --> 05:11.813
I'm done waiting, Alfred.
I'm going up there, with or without you.

05:11.980 --> 05:13.481
Imagine my surprise.

05:13.648 --> 05:15.233
You are going to eat something on the way!

05:22.448 --> 05:25.451
Now that we know Matches Malone was
the trigger man, we can work backwards.

05:25.618 --> 05:28.121
His file has him working primarily
with two contractors.

05:28.287 --> 05:30.748
One's dead.
The other one's known as the Lady.

05:31.165 --> 05:35.044
Her? She's the one that sent the assassins
after you at Galavan's penthouse.

05:35.211 --> 05:36.587
Yeah, her. You know where she's at?

05:36.754 --> 05:37.755
In the wind.

05:37.964 --> 05:40.508
She went out of business
after you killed her A-team.

05:40.967 --> 05:42.969
Put her rep in the toilet. Ironic, huh?

05:43.761 --> 05:47.265
At least I have a list of her known
associates. It'll have to do for now.

05:47.932 --> 05:49.183
Someone must know where she is.

05:49.350 --> 05:51.769
Look, her known associates
are professional hit men.

05:52.437 --> 05:54.230
Come back to GCPD.

05:54.397 --> 05:57.150
You'll have resources,
not to mention, you know, me.

05:57.650 --> 06:00.403
Yeah, and I'd have Barnes
looking over my shoulder.

06:00.611 --> 06:02.864
I need to be able to do things my way,
at least for now.

06:03.114 --> 06:04.866
All right, but don't take
too much time, okay?

06:05.033 --> 06:06.242
I'm supposed to be training Alvarez.

06:06.409 --> 06:08.494
It's like trying to teach a halibut
how to put on socks.

06:08.661 --> 06:09.662
Yeah.

06:10.580 --> 06:11.664
Is that it?

06:11.956 --> 06:15.710
You don't carry a badge anymore,
partner, remember, hmm?

06:15.877 --> 06:18.671
I think you need to grab a few items
from the whammy drawer.

06:20.131 --> 06:21.716
Can you believe
they let Barbara out of Arkham?

06:21.883 --> 06:23.676
First Penguin, then her?

06:23.843 --> 06:25.553
What, they don't have locks on the doors?

06:27.180 --> 06:28.473
Good choice.

06:33.061 --> 06:34.062
Hey, Jim?

06:35.438 --> 06:36.689
Be careful out there.

06:38.232 --> 06:39.400
Always.

06:41.277 --> 06:43.446
It's gonna be a bad day
for the hit men of Gotham.

06:55.500 --> 06:57.627
I said, where's the Lady?

06:57.794 --> 06:58.920
No one knows!

07:00.004 --> 07:01.005
Wrong answer.

07:03.508 --> 07:06.552
- Someone knows.
- I don't! I swear!

07:14.352 --> 07:15.353
Where is she?

07:15.728 --> 07:18.439
She might be at a club called the Artemis.

07:18.940 --> 07:19.941
Thank you.

07:41.796 --> 07:43.631
The moment has arrived, Ms. Peabody.

07:44.715 --> 07:50.179
Our success here could finally free
humanity from the shackles of mortality.

07:50.346 --> 07:54.517
As you said the first dozen times
we attempted reanimation, Professor,

07:54.851 --> 07:55.893
<i>and failed.</i>

07:56.060 --> 07:59.355
Oh, but I have a very good feeling
about Patient 44.

07:59.522 --> 08:01.941
You need to be more positive.

08:02.817 --> 08:06.612
Someone at Wayne Enterprises
ran a search for Karen Jennings.

08:08.906 --> 08:10.366
Do you think she's been found?

08:10.575 --> 08:12.577
I don't see how. We've never been able to.

08:12.743 --> 08:14.287
But someone is looking.

08:15.037 --> 08:16.581
She was our first.

08:17.415 --> 08:20.751
One small stroke
on the canvas of possibility.

08:20.918 --> 08:22.545
Such promise, do you remember?

08:22.962 --> 08:26.883
I remember the orderlies she maimed
and the two she killed.

08:27.049 --> 08:29.343
Creation is always so violent.

08:29.510 --> 08:30.511
<i>She could expose us.</i>

08:30.928 --> 08:33.890
Oh, Karen, who's looking for you?

08:35.016 --> 08:36.934
Do they know what you've become?

08:39.353 --> 08:41.939
What I turned you into?

09:07.173 --> 09:09.300
Nope. No joy, never mind.

09:09.717 --> 09:12.970
Still kind of nice to get out the manor,
have a little drive in the country.

09:14.597 --> 09:17.225
<i>Oh, that's terrific, isn't it?
She's made a bloody tea leaf out of you.</i>

09:17.892 --> 09:20.811
"Street smarts"? Streets smarts, my eye.

09:21.312 --> 09:24.106
Shush, Alfred.
These are merely technical skills.

09:24.273 --> 09:26.025
- Oh.
- Morally neutral.

09:57.431 --> 09:58.432
What is it?

10:04.438 --> 10:05.564
<i>Careful, Master Bruce.</i>

10:05.773 --> 10:07.608
She's got some kind
of weird hunting knife.

10:15.866 --> 10:16.951
We don't wanna hurt you.

10:18.160 --> 10:20.454
What're you doing?
Raise your gun. Raise your gun.

10:20.621 --> 10:21.956
My name is Bruce Wayne.

10:24.292 --> 10:25.584
I just wanna talk to you.

10:27.461 --> 10:28.713
Bruce Wayne?

10:29.672 --> 10:31.215
You're Bruce Wayne?

10:32.508 --> 10:33.551
That's far enough.

10:34.677 --> 10:35.678
Drop the knife.

10:35.845 --> 10:37.013
It's not a knife.

10:37.888 --> 10:41.058
Whatever it was you used to do this to me,
just drop it right now.

10:41.225 --> 10:42.351
I can't.

10:58.534 --> 11:00.578
- Listen to me--
- That's far enough.

11:00.745 --> 11:01.746
Alfred!

11:01.912 --> 11:03.581
Look around you, Master Bruce.

11:05.833 --> 11:10.796
Listen, I have no idea what you are,
but whatever that thing is,

11:12.048 --> 11:13.174
<i>it's bloody dangerous.</i>

11:16.093 --> 11:17.553
Do you know who I am?

11:18.637 --> 11:19.722
<i>You seemed to recognize me.</i>

11:19.889 --> 11:20.973
How did you find me?

11:21.891 --> 11:25.227
My father, Thomas Wayne, came here
the week before he died.

11:27.355 --> 11:28.564
He had it in his calendar.

11:28.939 --> 11:31.776
His calendar? Great. Were you followed?

11:32.360 --> 11:35.321
No. I don't know. By who?

11:36.322 --> 11:38.783
No, no, we weren't followed.

11:39.283 --> 11:41.285
Good.
Then you can leave.

11:42.453 --> 11:43.996
Not until you answer my questions.

11:44.163 --> 11:46.874
I know my father came to talk to you
about something called Pinewood Farms.

11:47.041 --> 11:48.042
What is that?

11:48.667 --> 11:50.252
God. You don't know anything, do you?

11:50.419 --> 11:51.629
So tell me.

11:53.714 --> 11:56.133
Do you not understand
that these people will kill you?

11:56.300 --> 11:57.718
I've been trying to tell him that.

11:59.637 --> 12:01.013
I'm not afraid to die.

12:02.014 --> 12:03.391
Not if it means doing the right thing.

12:03.641 --> 12:06.894
Yeah? How'd that work out for your dad?

12:09.522 --> 12:12.233
You have to go.
It's not safe for you here.

12:14.235 --> 12:15.319
I don't care.

12:17.488 --> 12:21.492
Whatever my father was investigating
got him and my mom killed.

12:22.159 --> 12:25.287
You're the first person I've found
who might know why. Please.

12:27.248 --> 12:29.083
You have to tell me what he was doing.

12:41.512 --> 12:43.097
The Artemis is a private club, sir.

12:43.973 --> 12:46.183
I need to see if someone's inside.
It'll just take a minute.

12:46.976 --> 12:48.978
Members only.

12:49.311 --> 12:50.521
Jim?

12:55.276 --> 12:56.402
What a coincidence.

12:59.321 --> 13:00.531
Can I borrow him a moment?

13:10.374 --> 13:12.209
Did I not make myself clear last night?

13:12.668 --> 13:13.711
Oh, you did.

13:13.878 --> 13:15.796
And I wanted to respect your boundaries,

13:15.963 --> 13:19.758
but I was wondering if you knew
that this is a women's-only club.

13:20.092 --> 13:23.888
Plus, its members are, shall we say,
of a criminal persuasion.

13:24.138 --> 13:25.139
Hmm?

13:25.389 --> 13:28.017
Didn't think so, which is why I'm here.

13:28.684 --> 13:29.852
Let me guess.

13:30.728 --> 13:32.146
You're gonna talk to the Lady for me,

13:32.313 --> 13:35.941
get the information I need
if I just, what, trust you?

13:36.442 --> 13:38.652
No one likes a smarty pants.
So what's your plan, then?

13:38.819 --> 13:39.820
- My plan?
- Mmm-hmm.

13:39.987 --> 13:41.572
My plan is to stick a gun
in the Lady's face

13:41.739 --> 13:43.908
and have her beg me
not to pull the trigger

13:44.241 --> 13:46.243
until she tells me
everything I want to know.

13:46.494 --> 13:50.080
The Gordon special. I remember it well.

13:51.081 --> 13:53.751
Problem is you're not a cop anymore.

13:54.168 --> 13:55.544
Why is that by the way?

13:57.129 --> 14:00.090
The point is,
if you go in there guns blazing,

14:00.257 --> 14:02.134
the Lady will disappear,
probably for good.

14:02.760 --> 14:05.596
I can go inside and get you what you want.

14:06.597 --> 14:07.765
What do you have to lose?

14:12.478 --> 14:13.646
Why are you doing this?

14:15.940 --> 14:18.150
I was there, remember?

14:19.068 --> 14:20.945
When you first caught the Wayne case?

14:22.446 --> 14:23.822
I know what it means to you.

14:25.115 --> 14:26.951
You think that if you can solve it,

14:28.118 --> 14:30.079
you can close the door on the past

14:30.246 --> 14:34.458
and maybe, just maybe, it will stay shut,

14:35.626 --> 14:37.294
and then you'll be able to start over.

14:38.420 --> 14:41.006
And you really have to ask me
why I'm doing this?

15:02.486 --> 15:03.612
Buy a girl a drink?

15:06.240 --> 15:07.283
Have we met?

15:07.449 --> 15:09.827
No, but I'm kind of famous.

15:12.329 --> 15:13.330
Oh...

15:13.706 --> 15:16.667
The notorious Barbara Kean. Please.

15:24.008 --> 15:25.175
Sorry about your hand.

15:26.218 --> 15:27.595
I don't get many visitors.

15:28.304 --> 15:29.763
You, uh, spooked me.

15:29.930 --> 15:32.057
Wait, what, we, we spooked you?

15:33.350 --> 15:34.435
How long have you lived here?

15:34.685 --> 15:37.688
Ten years. Ever since Pinewood.

15:38.689 --> 15:42.026
Is that where you got that?

15:43.819 --> 15:47.698
Pinewood Farms was a bioengineering
program at Wayne Enterprises,

15:48.115 --> 15:49.742
the kind that was kept off the books.

15:50.451 --> 15:51.744
I was one of their first volunteers.

15:51.910 --> 15:53.037
What? You volunteered for that, did you?

15:53.203 --> 15:54.580
I didn't have many options at the time.

15:55.706 --> 15:56.707
I was at Blackgate.

15:56.874 --> 15:58.667
Blackgate? Nice.

15:59.376 --> 16:01.295
I take it you weren't a guard, then?

16:02.546 --> 16:03.881
I was born with a crippled arm.

16:05.799 --> 16:10.888
Growing up, my father liked two things,
booze and beating his deformed daughter.

16:12.139 --> 16:13.474
One night, I fought back.

16:14.475 --> 16:17.895
He fell down the stairs
and broke his neck.

16:19.772 --> 16:21.106
I went to Blackgate for murder.

16:21.899 --> 16:23.150
But that's self-defense.

16:23.400 --> 16:24.902
Well, people are scared of different.

16:26.195 --> 16:27.613
Jury sent me away.

16:28.572 --> 16:30.407
<i>One day, these men show up,</i>

16:31.325 --> 16:33.369
tell me they're gonna fix my arm.

16:34.328 --> 16:35.913
Not only fix it, make it better.

16:38.374 --> 16:40.918
Instead, they turned me into the monster
who everybody thought I was.

16:43.420 --> 16:45.756
Did my father know what was going on
at Pinewood Farms?

16:45.923 --> 16:47.257
No. No.

16:48.967 --> 16:51.261
When he found out what was going on,

16:52.012 --> 16:55.307
<i>when he saw what they were doing to us,
he shut it down.</i>

16:56.100 --> 16:57.434
Paid to put us into hiding.

16:59.103 --> 17:00.729
So how many were there of you?

17:01.021 --> 17:04.233
I'm not sure. I know
most didn't survive the experiments.

17:06.694 --> 17:08.487
It started up again, didn't it?

17:10.114 --> 17:12.408
<i>That's why my father came to see you
after all those years.</i>

17:12.700 --> 17:17.955
He wasn't sure, but he had his suspicions.
He came to warn me.

17:21.208 --> 17:22.668
Whoever was running Pinewood,

17:23.836 --> 17:26.505
whoever started it up again,
I know that's who killed my parents.

17:27.089 --> 17:28.340
<i>Do you remember any names?</i>

17:29.133 --> 17:30.843
None of them ever used their names
around us,

17:32.177 --> 17:33.637
but the man who was in charge,

17:34.638 --> 17:38.976
I can still see his face
every time I close my eyes.

17:40.811 --> 17:42.104
Then you need to take us there.

17:43.981 --> 17:46.608
You need to take us to Pinewood Farms.

17:49.570 --> 17:51.905
My father risked his life to save you.

17:54.825 --> 17:56.660
I'm asking you to repay that favor.

17:59.204 --> 18:03.417
I promise, nothing will happen to you.

18:08.088 --> 18:09.089
Okay.

18:09.256 --> 18:11.800
Yeah, it didn't go quite to plan,

18:11.967 --> 18:13.343
but whatever.

18:13.510 --> 18:15.804
I look incredible in that wedding dress.

18:16.722 --> 18:18.140
I just bet you did.

18:20.142 --> 18:21.935
And how did you get out of Arkham?

18:22.269 --> 18:24.938
Well, that was easy,
with a lot of...

18:25.397 --> 18:29.443
"Oh, my God, I can't
believe I killed all these people."

18:31.361 --> 18:33.197
Boo-hoo.

18:34.573 --> 18:35.824
Well, what's your plan now?

18:36.325 --> 18:40.537
Well, I'm thinking about
getting into the assassination business.

18:41.121 --> 18:42.498
Only I need a partner.

18:44.750 --> 18:46.210
What do you have to offer?

18:47.336 --> 18:49.630
I'm rich, fabulous,

18:49.797 --> 18:54.343
and, in your case, I may have
just the thing to restore your reputation.

18:55.886 --> 18:56.929
Really?

18:59.890 --> 19:01.725
<i>All right, see you next week.</i>

19:02.559 --> 19:03.685
Let me help you with that.

19:05.103 --> 19:06.146
Thanks.

19:20.369 --> 19:22.079
Stubborn.

19:25.249 --> 19:26.416
I need to speak to the Lady.

19:26.583 --> 19:27.751
She's expecting you.

19:28.919 --> 19:30.671
Hey, Jim. Guess what.

19:31.588 --> 19:32.798
You were right.

19:40.722 --> 19:41.723
Wow.

19:41.974 --> 19:44.393
Is anyone getting major déjà vu here?

19:45.644 --> 19:51.608
Only wait, oh, we're missing Lee. Shame.
That would've been a real family reunion.

19:51.775 --> 19:53.610
So that's what this has been about?

19:53.777 --> 19:54.862
Delivering me to her?

19:55.028 --> 19:57.072
<i>Well, when I saw her picture
in your file,</i>

19:57.239 --> 19:59.449
I figured you'd go after her,
so I did some digging.

19:59.992 --> 20:03.787
Saw you two had some history,
and it all kind of came together.

20:04.788 --> 20:06.331
So did I deliver or what?

20:06.540 --> 20:08.041
When you said he was looking for me,

20:08.208 --> 20:11.962
I assumed this had something to do
with the men I sent to kill him?

20:12.296 --> 20:17.301
No, he knows you contracted
Matches Malone for the Wayne murders,

20:17.467 --> 20:22.848
and he is just obsessed with finding out
who hired you. It's like his thing.

20:23.015 --> 20:24.558
That's why he's here?

20:26.518 --> 20:30.480
I have absolutely no idea
who is behind the Wayne murders.

20:31.023 --> 20:32.274
You didn't take the contract?

20:32.441 --> 20:35.152
Oh, no, I mean I did,
but we did it all over the telephone.

20:35.319 --> 20:36.445
<i>I never met the client.</i>

20:36.653 --> 20:38.071
Well, you must have got a name.

20:38.280 --> 20:40.908
- He went by a nickname.
- Oh...

20:42.618 --> 20:43.827
Poor Jim.

20:45.162 --> 20:46.914
So close.

20:47.623 --> 20:49.708
It's almost sad you have to die.

20:52.252 --> 20:54.838
Oh.
You know, should we just tell him?

20:55.213 --> 20:57.674
You always this sentimental?

20:58.133 --> 21:02.888
Fine. He called himself the Philosopher.

21:03.931 --> 21:07.434
Here you go, Jim. Now you know.

21:13.565 --> 21:14.816
Told you I had a plan.

21:21.156 --> 21:24.743
It doesn't exactly scream, "top secret
bioengineering lab," does it?

21:25.410 --> 21:26.745
This is it.

21:28.538 --> 21:31.375
All right, you two sit tight.
I'll have a shifty.

21:35.712 --> 21:36.713
Honestly.

21:39.883 --> 21:42.761
She's here. Right.

22:24.052 --> 22:26.555
I'd wager nothing's been touched in here
for a decade.

22:38.233 --> 22:39.401
Are you okay?

22:41.945 --> 22:46.324
Seeing all this,
it feels like yesterday that I was here.

22:48.869 --> 22:52.622
I'm sorry.
Uh, it looks like your father was wrong.

22:53.498 --> 22:54.833
Maybe it's for the best.

22:56.084 --> 22:57.335
You can move on now.

22:59.713 --> 23:01.798
You knew this place was shut down,
didn't you?

23:02.924 --> 23:04.676
Is that why you brought me here,
hoping I'd give up?

23:04.843 --> 23:05.844
Steady on, Master Bruce.

23:06.011 --> 23:08.138
No, she's hiding something.
I can see it in her eyes.

23:09.222 --> 23:11.558
I don't understand.
What won't you tell me?

23:12.684 --> 23:13.685
Hey!

23:14.144 --> 23:16.480
Hey, this is private property.
I'm gonna call the cops.

23:17.522 --> 23:19.316
The girl comes with us,
and no one gets hurt.

23:19.983 --> 23:21.276
Run, Master Bruce.

23:22.319 --> 23:23.361
Run!

23:51.598 --> 23:52.808
Come on.

24:04.528 --> 24:05.862
Drop the gun! Now!

24:24.589 --> 24:26.758
You go down Fourth,
and I'll look this way.

24:27.342 --> 24:28.593
Got it.

24:30.220 --> 24:31.346
What the hell was that about?

24:31.888 --> 24:32.889
Don't be mad.

24:33.056 --> 24:36.017
I was tied to a chair
and nearly killed, again.

24:36.226 --> 24:37.227
What should I be feeling?

24:37.519 --> 24:38.603
Gratitude?

24:39.604 --> 24:40.981
I'm not feeling that.

24:41.898 --> 24:44.901
I needed the Lady to trust me.
It's called a plan.

24:45.068 --> 24:47.529
- "A plan"? What if I'd stayed outside?
- Mmm.

24:48.029 --> 24:49.030
Really?

24:49.447 --> 24:53.034
Look, we got the name.
We should be celebrating.

24:53.493 --> 24:55.495
Hey, we kind of make a pretty good team.

24:55.829 --> 24:57.122
This doesn't change anything.

24:58.081 --> 25:01.293
I got you the information
that I said I would.

25:01.918 --> 25:05.755
Everything I did in there, I did for you.
You have to see that.

25:07.090 --> 25:08.592
Honestly, I don't know what I see.

25:09.593 --> 25:10.635
Then look.

25:13.138 --> 25:14.139
Please.

25:17.726 --> 25:18.810
What do you care?

25:19.227 --> 25:21.271
After everything that's happened.
Let's say you've changed.

25:21.563 --> 25:22.898
What do you care what I think?

25:25.108 --> 25:26.943
Because when I woke up from that coma,

25:28.195 --> 25:30.530
the first image I saw was your face

25:30.864 --> 25:33.116
as you were holding onto me
from the church window.

25:34.367 --> 25:35.660
You were trying to save me.

25:36.912 --> 25:39.581
Because in that moment,
you didn't see the monster.

25:41.625 --> 25:42.792
You just saw me.

25:44.502 --> 25:45.837
That's what I've been holding on to.

25:49.174 --> 25:52.302
Because I feel like, if you
could just look at me like that again,

25:54.554 --> 25:55.555
I'd be okay.

25:58.975 --> 25:59.976
I'd make it.

26:02.896 --> 26:04.147
You wanna be a better person?

26:05.190 --> 26:06.191
Yes.

26:07.442 --> 26:08.860
It's your choice to make.

26:10.028 --> 26:11.404
I can't be that for you.

26:12.697 --> 26:13.865
You tried to kill Lee.

26:16.660 --> 26:17.827
I can't forgive that.

26:19.496 --> 26:20.664
I won't.

26:31.508 --> 26:32.509
Just get it.

26:33.843 --> 26:35.637
Bruce.

26:36.388 --> 26:39.015
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down. Slow-- Slow--

26:45.105 --> 26:46.189
I'll be right there.

26:59.244 --> 27:00.287
Alfred!

27:03.123 --> 27:04.207
About bloody time, mate.

27:04.374 --> 27:05.625
Not my call, pal, how about you

27:05.792 --> 27:06.835
stop getting arrested so much?

27:07.002 --> 27:09.004
- Where's Bruce?
- In with Barnes.

27:09.170 --> 27:10.171
<i>Bullock!</i>

27:10.880 --> 27:12.257
Prep Karen Jennings to travel.

27:12.424 --> 27:14.801
I want her at Blackgate today. No contact.

27:14.968 --> 27:16.886
You! You're free to go.

27:17.178 --> 27:19.931
I suggest you do so
before I change my mind.

27:22.017 --> 27:23.059
What did you tell him?

27:24.060 --> 27:26.730
The truth. He didn't seem to like it.

27:28.648 --> 27:30.233
All right. How about you tell me?

27:33.403 --> 27:35.947
Your father found out
about this program,

27:36.114 --> 27:39.284
where Karen Jennings was a subject,
and shut it down.

27:39.451 --> 27:43.204
When it was restarted, he tried
to stop it, and they had him killed.

27:43.371 --> 27:45.415
And you think Karen can identify
the men involved?

27:45.665 --> 27:48.918
Doesn't know their names.
Says she can remember the faces.

27:53.465 --> 27:56.259
The man who contracted Matches Malone
to kill your parents

27:57.344 --> 27:58.845
called himself the Philosopher.

28:00.472 --> 28:02.223
Hold on. How do you know this?

28:02.390 --> 28:05.143
I've been conducting my own investigation.
I found out today.

28:05.310 --> 28:08.772
And I'd be willing to bet that this
is the man who is behind Pinewood.

28:11.941 --> 28:13.068
What do we do?

28:18.656 --> 28:21.326
Have Lucius Fox put together
the files of all the scientists

28:21.493 --> 28:24.037
who've worked for Wayne Enterprises
over the past 15 years.

28:24.204 --> 28:27.374
If Karen can pick this man out,
if he is the Philosopher,

28:27.957 --> 28:29.250
we can tie him to your parents' murder.

28:29.542 --> 28:32.670
Well, that's assuming, of course,
that Karen Jennings is still alive.

28:33.797 --> 28:36.466
I mean, it's obvious
these guys mean business.

28:37.217 --> 28:39.469
She's gonna be dead
the minute she hits Blackgate Prison.

28:41.721 --> 28:43.181
That's why we're gonna break her out.

28:45.850 --> 28:47.560
How much money
can you put together quickly?

28:49.646 --> 28:50.897
How much do you need?

29:04.994 --> 29:07.997
Patient 44's EEG patterns
confirm paradoxical sleep.

29:08.164 --> 29:11.668
We're getting close.
He's getting close.

29:12.502 --> 29:16.714
Karen Jennings was arrested
and is being sent to Blackgate Prison.

29:17.841 --> 29:18.842
Pity.

29:19.676 --> 29:22.053
It seems we should abandon our efforts
to bring her back.

29:23.638 --> 29:25.432
She cannot be allowed to talk.

29:25.598 --> 29:26.641
I'll send a team.

29:26.808 --> 29:29.269
Actually, I was thinking this would be
the perfect opportunity

29:29.436 --> 29:32.147
to let our sub-zero guest
try out his new suit.

29:33.314 --> 29:34.315
You sure?

29:35.316 --> 29:38.570
Whatever that gas did to him,
he's not the man he was before.

29:38.736 --> 29:41.114
He seems very angry.

29:42.031 --> 29:44.033
Oh, I know.

29:49.164 --> 29:50.331
I was listening to that.

29:50.540 --> 29:52.959
Hello, Victor. How are you feeling?

29:54.085 --> 29:55.128
<i>How am I feeling?</i>

29:57.005 --> 29:58.715
I'm locked in a freezer.
How do you think I'm feeling?

29:59.591 --> 30:01.134
That's why I'm here.

30:01.801 --> 30:06.389
How would you like to go
on a little field trip?

30:40.381 --> 30:41.508
What the hell?

30:59.943 --> 31:01.110
Damn.

31:37.897 --> 31:40.066
Yo, Marty, you're never gonna believe it.

31:41.317 --> 31:43.278
You have a decision to make.

31:44.153 --> 31:46.489
You can keep the money, toss us your gun,

31:46.656 --> 31:48.616
and tell your supervisor
you were disarmed,

31:48.783 --> 31:51.119
or be a hero
and wake up like your friend here

31:51.286 --> 31:53.329
with nothing to show for it
but a massive headache.

31:53.496 --> 31:55.665
I'd say it's a bit of
a no-brainer, wouldn't you, sweetheart?

31:56.499 --> 31:57.667
Give me your tool.

31:59.168 --> 32:00.461
You can go.

32:06.009 --> 32:07.176
Go ahead.

32:10.471 --> 32:13.016
Enjoy your cash. Let's go!

32:28.197 --> 32:30.199
Bruce, what is going on?
Who is this?

32:30.450 --> 32:31.492
A friend.

32:31.993 --> 32:33.202
Nice to meet you.

32:33.369 --> 32:34.871
He's gonna help us get you out of town.

32:35.371 --> 32:38.541
I have a car, cash, and a new identity
waiting for you back at Wayne Manor.

32:40.418 --> 32:42.045
I can't believe you would do this for me.

32:42.378 --> 32:45.048
I made a promise
nothing would happen to you.

32:45.965 --> 32:47.216
I intend to keep it.

32:47.634 --> 32:49.135
Karen, do you know a man

32:49.302 --> 32:51.387
who goes by the nickname
"the Philosopher"?

32:51.721 --> 32:54.182
That's, uh, the man who ran the program.

32:55.058 --> 32:58.186
That's what the others called him,
something about some game they played.

32:58.728 --> 33:00.063
And you can identify him?

33:00.229 --> 33:01.397
- Yeah.
- Good.

33:02.398 --> 33:04.567
We have someone tracking down the files
of all the scientists

33:04.734 --> 33:06.527
<i>who've worked for Wayne Enterprises
over the years.</i>

33:06.694 --> 33:08.279
<i>After that, you can disappear.</i>

33:08.446 --> 33:10.239
No one will ever hurt you again.

33:12.575 --> 33:14.077
You sound just like him.

33:17.163 --> 33:19.165
I have been hiding something
from you, Bruce.

33:21.876 --> 33:24.379
Your father did more
than just rescue me from Pinewood.

33:25.088 --> 33:26.255
What do you mean?

33:26.422 --> 33:32.011
After what happened, I was so angry,
but he never gave up on me.

33:33.012 --> 33:35.598
<i>He kept visiting, gave me books to read,</i>

33:36.599 --> 33:38.559
a music box for my birthday.

33:39.727 --> 33:41.729
He kept reminding me that I wasn't alone,

33:42.730 --> 33:44.315
that I wasn't a monster.

33:46.109 --> 33:50.071
I never knew what a real father should be
until Thomas Wayne.

33:51.906 --> 33:54.117
That's why
I didn't want you to pursue this.

33:55.368 --> 33:57.078
I didn't want you to see him differently.

33:58.788 --> 34:00.873
Your father started Pinewood, Bruce.

34:02.166 --> 34:03.626
<i>His intentions were good,</i>

34:04.711 --> 34:07.088
<i>but the man in charge
took advantage of him.</i>

34:07.755 --> 34:10.675
He didn't realize the truth
until it was too late.

34:12.468 --> 34:16.639
Pinewood was his burden,
but it doesn't have to be yours.

34:18.641 --> 34:20.143
It's not a burden.

34:25.022 --> 34:26.232
It's who I am.

34:32.321 --> 34:33.406
Hold on!

34:54.135 --> 34:55.386
Victor?

34:56.429 --> 34:57.430
You.

35:00.516 --> 35:01.684
Put down the gun!

35:11.027 --> 35:12.069
Go! Get on Bruce!

35:13.613 --> 35:15.239
You both all right? You all right?

35:18.034 --> 35:20.703
Go! Go. Run. It's me he's after.

35:20.870 --> 35:22.288
We're not leaving without you.

35:24.499 --> 35:26.501
I'm so glad I met you, Bruce.

35:27.126 --> 35:31.255
Your dad would be so proud of you,
of the man that you've become.

35:37.595 --> 35:39.305
- Hey, Karen!
- Stay here!

35:51.234 --> 35:55.571
No! No! No!

35:55.738 --> 35:57.073
Get back! Get back!

36:18.469 --> 36:19.470
Sorry I'm late.

36:19.720 --> 36:21.848
I did get you
that salt water taffy you like, so--

36:22.014 --> 36:23.140
Shh.

36:23.474 --> 36:24.600
You'll wake her.

36:26.435 --> 36:29.105
I thought she was in Arkham, in a coma.

36:29.897 --> 36:30.898
Not anymore.

36:32.108 --> 36:35.987
She showed up
a couple of hours ago, poor thing.

36:36.612 --> 36:38.614
What is she doing here?

36:39.574 --> 36:40.825
She's come home.

36:49.333 --> 36:50.334
Huh.

36:59.594 --> 37:01.846
My father risked his life to protect her.

37:04.307 --> 37:07.685
He cared for her, and now she's dead

37:13.900 --> 37:15.026
Because of me.

37:17.528 --> 37:19.113
Not because of you, Master Bruce.

37:20.907 --> 37:22.199
Because of what you're pursuing.

37:23.659 --> 37:25.077
Is there a difference?

37:27.788 --> 37:28.789
Yes.

37:30.791 --> 37:33.669
And if you can't make your peace
with that, then you're not ready.

37:35.838 --> 37:38.674
There will be others, Master Bruce.

37:43.971 --> 37:46.557
Karen was the only one who knew
what the Philosopher looked like.

37:51.020 --> 37:52.730
How are we going to find him now?

38:04.825 --> 38:06.327
You need to have faith, Bruce.

38:08.245 --> 38:09.789
I know what you risked today.

38:12.375 --> 38:14.377
- If Barnes finds out you were involved--
- He will,

38:16.420 --> 38:17.922
if he hasn't already.

38:18.506 --> 38:21.008
Pretty sure my days at the GCPD are over,

38:21.550 --> 38:23.094
but I knew that going in.

38:24.470 --> 38:25.972
Then why'd you do it?

38:26.931 --> 38:28.599
You're not the only one
who made a promise.

38:32.728 --> 38:34.772
- Oh, Mr. Fox.
- I let myself in.

38:36.065 --> 38:38.067
I think I might have something.

38:39.402 --> 38:42.571
When I was compiling
the personnel files on scientists,

38:42.780 --> 38:46.325
I also ran a cross-reference search
on Pinewood Farms and the Philosopher,

38:46.784 --> 38:48.119
and found this.

38:48.494 --> 38:51.205
It's from a company newsletter
taken 12 years ago.

38:52.081 --> 38:54.375
The photo lists team nicknames.

38:54.583 --> 38:56.002
<i>Look at the man next to your father.</i>

39:00.381 --> 39:03.634
"Hugo Strange, the Philosopher."

39:06.095 --> 39:07.430
He runs Arkham now.

39:10.516 --> 39:11.517
A friend.

39:14.437 --> 39:16.230
Someone he trusted.

39:19.316 --> 39:21.068
That's not fair.

39:25.072 --> 39:26.449
That's not right.

39:36.667 --> 39:39.295
Oh, Karen, what a shame.

39:40.212 --> 39:41.922
You held such promise.

39:43.507 --> 39:47.011
Victor said he recognized Jim Gordon,
said he was with a boy.

39:48.471 --> 39:49.472
Bruce Wayne.

39:50.473 --> 39:53.851
So he and Jim Gordon are working together.
Well, well.

39:54.602 --> 39:59.148
I think life is about to get
very interesting for us, Ms. Peabody.

40:00.816 --> 40:02.777
It's coming from downstairs.

40:04.028 --> 40:05.321
Patient 44.

40:05.613 --> 40:07.615
But the reanimation
should take another 12 hours.

40:10.076 --> 40:12.078
- Grab him. Grab him.
- Stop!

40:30.888 --> 40:33.015
Oh, Peabody, we did it.

40:35.059 --> 40:36.977
We brought someone back.

40:37.686 --> 40:40.189
We actually did it.

40:42.108 --> 40:43.234
<i>What? What is it now, Sister?</i>

40:43.400 --> 40:44.527
What's he saying?

40:46.779 --> 40:48.572
<i>Heathen dogs, huh?</i>

40:50.449 --> 40:51.867
What now, Sister?

40:52.576 --> 40:56.205
Oh, the holy city. Oh, I see.

40:56.539 --> 40:58.040
<i>The saint will deliver us.</i>

40:59.333 --> 41:03.295
No, don't leave. Don't leave.

41:03.546 --> 41:04.964
Should I gas him?

41:05.631 --> 41:07.174
<i>Azrael.</i>

41:10.219 --> 41:13.639
Azrael!

41:18.644 --> 41:20.104
Azrael.

42:07.484 --> 42:08.485
English - SDH
