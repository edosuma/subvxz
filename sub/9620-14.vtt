00:02.569 --> 00:03.303

00:21.454 --> 00:22.522
ARE YOU EATING?

00:22.589 --> 00:23.456
&gt;&gt; HOT DOG SUNDAE.

00:23.523 --> 00:24.190
THEY'RE IN THE BREAK ROOM.

00:24.257 --> 00:26.493
THERE'S ONLY ONE LEFT.

00:26.559 --> 00:29.929
[CRASH]

00:29.996 --> 00:30.530
&gt;&gt; ARE YOU OKAY?

00:30.597 --> 00:31.498
&gt;&gt; NO, I'M FINE.

00:31.564 --> 00:32.799
&gt;&gt; NOT YOU, MY CART.

00:32.866 --> 00:33.600
&gt;&gt; NOW, HELP ME UP.

00:33.666 --> 00:34.567
I NEED TO GET TO THE BREAK ROOM

00:34.634 --> 00:35.201
BEFORE SOMEONE GETS

00:35.268 --> 00:39.572
THE LAST HOT DOG SUNDAE.

00:39.639 --> 00:41.074
&gt;&gt; THIS IS A TRAGEDY.

00:41.141 --> 00:41.574
&gt;&gt; IT'S OKAY,

00:41.641 --> 00:42.509
I'LL GET ONE LATER.

00:42.575 --> 00:44.177
&gt;&gt; NOT YOU, MY CART.

00:44.244 --> 00:44.644
LOOK AT THIS.

00:44.711 --> 00:45.812
THE WHEEL IS COMPLETELY HANGING

00:45.879 --> 00:47.213
OFF THE AXLE.

00:47.280 --> 00:48.715
&gt;&gt; MAYBE IT'S A SIGN, JIMMY.

00:48.782 --> 00:49.449
&gt;&gt; WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

00:49.516 --> 00:50.150
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, THAT YOU SHOULD

00:50.216 --> 00:50.984
GET A NEW MAIL CART.

00:51.050 --> 00:51.651
&gt;&gt; YEAH, YOU HAD THAT ONE

00:51.718 --> 00:52.585
A REALLY LONG TIME.

00:52.652 --> 00:53.753
&gt;&gt; IT'S PRETTY SQUEAKY.

00:53.820 --> 00:54.854
&gt;&gt; AND THE WHEELS ARE MESSED UP.

00:54.921 --> 00:55.622
IT'S LIKE A SHOPPING CART

00:55.688 --> 00:56.423
THAT KEEPS MAKING A LEFT

00:56.489 --> 00:57.924
INTO THE CANNED GOODS.

00:57.991 --> 00:58.892
&gt;&gt; THERE IS NOTHING WRONG

00:58.958 --> 00:59.993
WITH MY CART THAT A LITTLE

01:00.059 --> 01:01.961
T.L.C. CAN'T FIX, OKAY?

01:02.028 --> 01:09.402
COME ON, EMMA.

01:09.469 --> 01:11.137
&gt;&gt; INTERRUPTING PLAYTIME, AM I?

01:11.204 --> 01:12.005
&gt;&gt; KINDA, I'M NEXT ON

01:12.071 --> 01:17.677
THE TRAMPOLINE.

01:17.744 --> 01:20.079
&gt;&gt; I HAVE SOME EXCITING NEWS.

01:20.146 --> 01:22.081
&gt;&gt; YOU FOUND YOUR ROBOT FAMILY?

01:22.148 --> 01:23.316
&gt;&gt; RYAN, WE'VE BEEN OVER THIS,

01:23.383 --> 01:25.018
I AM NOT A ROBOT.

01:25.084 --> 01:26.152
&gt;&gt; WELL, SURE, THEY'D PROGRAM

01:26.219 --> 01:29.122
YOU TO BELIEVE THAT.

01:29.189 --> 01:29.823
&gt;&gt; HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF

01:29.889 --> 01:31.257
PORT GALHOUDI?

01:31.324 --> 01:31.825
&gt;&gt; NO.

01:31.891 --> 01:32.592
&gt;&gt; IS THAT A PLACE?

01:32.659 --> 01:34.027
&gt;&gt; IT IS A VERY SMALL PROVINCE,

01:34.093 --> 01:35.929
SOUTH OF THE KIVERIAN MOUNTAINS.

01:35.995 --> 01:38.531
&gt;&gt; IS THAT ANOTHER PLACE?

01:38.598 --> 01:39.399
&gt;&gt; ANYWAY, WE GOT A CALL

01:39.466 --> 01:40.033

HE'S A REAL KING.

01:53.346 --> 01:54.414
&gt;&gt; HE WEARS A CROWN.

01:54.481 --> 01:57.150
&gt;&gt; MADE OF ONION RINGS.

01:57.217 --> 01:57.851

03:29.976 --> 03:31.711
PLEASE DO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING.

03:31.778 --> 03:33.880
THOSE ARE FABERGE EGGS.

03:33.947 --> 03:34.514
&gt;&gt; I HOPE THEY'RE NOT

03:34.581 --> 03:35.481
EXPENSIVE, 'CAUSE I'VE NEVER

03:35.548 --> 03:36.549
JUGGLED BEFORE.

03:36.616 --> 03:38.785
&gt;&gt; THEY'RE INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE.

03:38.851 --> 03:41.287
&gt;&gt; GOT IT.

03:41.354 --> 03:41.921
&gt;&gt; WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED

03:41.988 --> 03:43.256
TO CALL THE PRINCE?

03:43.323 --> 03:44.324
DO WE CALL HIM, SIR?

03:44.390 --> 03:44.958
&gt;&gt; NO, NO, NO,

03:47.760 --> 03:50.930
YOUR ROYAL SUPREME EXCELLENCY.

03:50.997 --> 03:52.165
&gt;&gt; IAN!

03:52.231 --> 03:55.902
&gt;&gt; THAT'S HIM.

03:55.969 --> 03:58.271
YOUR ROYAL SUPREME EXCELLENCY,

03:58.338 --> 04:00.273
MAY I PRESENT TRUE JACKSON

04:00.340 --> 04:03.776

04:10.116 --> 04:10.617
&gt;&gt; NICE TO MEET YOU,

04:10.683 --> 04:15.755
MISS JACKSON.

04:15.822 --> 04:16.656
&gt;&gt; I WASN'T SUPPOSED TO DO THAT,

04:16.723 --> 04:18.324
WAS I?

04:18.391 --> 04:20.860
&gt;&gt; IT IS NOT CUSTOMARY, NO.

04:20.927 --> 04:21.527
&gt;&gt; THIS IS A VERY TASTEFUL

04:21.594 --> 04:22.795
MANSION YOU HAVE.

04:22.862 --> 04:24.697
MIND IF ME AND LULU PLAY TAG?

04:24.764 --> 04:26.165
&gt;&gt; RYAN, THIS PLACE IS FULL

04:26.232 --> 04:27.300
OF PRICELESS ARTIFACTS.

04:27.367 --> 04:28.034
I'M SURE THEY DON'T WANT

04:28.101 --> 04:28.501
US PLAYING.

04:28.568 --> 04:33.439
YOU'RE IT.

04:33.506 --> 04:34.941
&gt;&gt; SO, YOU WANT A SUIT?

04:35.008 --> 04:35.742
&gt;&gt; I DO.

04:35.808 --> 04:36.776
&gt;&gt; GREAT, WHAT SORT OF THING

04:36.843 --> 04:37.644
WERE YOU LOOKING FOR?

04:37.710 --> 04:39.445
SOMETHING HIP?

04:39.512 --> 04:42.515
&gt;&gt; I WOULD LIKE A SILK TUXEDO.

04:42.582 --> 04:43.716
&gt;&gt; A SILK TUXEDO?

04:43.783 --> 04:44.517
&gt;&gt; MM-HMM.

04:44.584 --> 04:45.885
&gt;&gt; BUT YOU'RE A KID.

04:45.952 --> 04:47.353
KIDS DON'T REALLY WEAR SILK

04:47.420 --> 04:48.554
UNLESS YOU WANT PAJAMAS.

04:48.621 --> 04:49.022
I CAN MAKE YOU

04:49.088 --> 04:50.323
SOME MEAN PAJAMAS.

04:50.390 --> 04:52.191
&gt;&gt; SHALL I ASK HER TO LEAVE?

04:52.258 --> 04:53.960
&gt;&gt; THAT WON'T BE NECESSARY, IAN.

04:54.027 --> 05:00.333
WAIT BY THE PAINTING.

05:00.400 --> 05:01.634
WHAT KIND OF SUIT DO YOU THINK

05:01.701 --> 05:03.002
I SHOULD WEAR?

05:03.069 --> 05:04.003
&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE SOMETHING

05:04.070 --> 05:05.538
WITH A LITTLE FLAIR.

05:05.605 --> 05:07.006
DO YOU LIKE ORANGE BUTTONS?

05:07.073 --> 05:07.940
&gt;&gt; I'VE NEVER EVEN HEARD

05:08.007 --> 05:09.542
OF ORANGE BUTTONS.

05:09.609 --> 05:10.309
&gt;&gt; I'M GONNA HAVE A LITTLE

05:10.376 --> 05:11.044
FUN WITH YOU.

05:11.110 --> 05:11.644
SOMETHING TELLS ME

05:11.711 --> 05:12.979
YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH FUN.

05:13.046 --> 05:14.047
&gt;&gt; OH, ON THE CONTRARY,

05:14.113 --> 05:16.816
I HAVE FUN ALL THE TIME.

05:16.883 --> 05:18.184
TELL HER, IAN!

05:18.251 --> 05:20.319
&gt;&gt; THE PRINCE IS QUITE A CUT-UP.

05:20.386 --> 05:20.987
&gt;&gt; WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME

05:21.054 --> 05:22.522
YOU DID SOMETHING CRAZY?

05:22.588 --> 05:23.690
&gt;&gt; WELL, THERE WAS THE DAY

05:23.756 --> 05:25.358
I POSED FOR THAT PAINTING.

05:25.425 --> 05:26.325
&gt;&gt; OH, YES,

05:26.392 --> 05:27.193
THE PRINCE PUT A STEAK

05:27.260 --> 05:28.227
IN MY POCKET

05:28.294 --> 05:29.595
AND THOSE TIGERS CHASED ME

05:29.662 --> 05:30.396
UP A TREE.

05:30.463 --> 05:33.366
WE LAUGHED AND LAUGHED.

05:33.433 --> 05:34.600
&gt;&gt; AND WHEN THE DOCTORS ARRIVED,

05:34.667 --> 05:35.568
I ORDERED THEM TO PUT HIM

05:35.635 --> 05:37.236
IN A GIANT BODY CAST.

05:37.303 --> 05:38.171
&gt;&gt; OH, YES, YES,

05:38.237 --> 05:39.439
VERY RESTRICTIVE.

05:39.505 --> 05:41.407
GOOD JOKE, SIR.

05:41.474 --> 05:42.308
&gt;&gt; AND THEN I RODE HIM

05:42.375 --> 05:43.509
AROUND LIKE A RAFT

05:43.576 --> 05:45.211
IN THE ROYAL POOL...

05:45.278 --> 05:45.812
&gt;&gt; ...WHICH IS FILLED

05:45.878 --> 05:48.214
WITH PIRANHAS.

05:48.281 --> 05:48.915
&gt;&gt; LET ME DO SOME NOODLING

05:48.981 --> 05:49.415
FOR A FEW HOURS

05:49.482 --> 05:50.216
AND THEN I'LL PRESENT YOU

05:50.283 --> 05:51.417
SOME DESIGNS LATER.

05:51.484 --> 05:52.585
&gt;&gt; EXCELLENT.

05:52.652 --> 05:53.653
IAN, WILL YOU FETCH ME

05:53.720 --> 05:55.421
A FIZZY WATER FROM THE KITCHEN?

05:55.488 --> 05:59.459
&gt;&gt; AS YOU WISH.

05:59.525 --> 06:00.560
&gt;&gt; I FILLED THE REFRIGERATOR

06:00.626 --> 06:01.661
WITH SNAKES.

06:01.728 --> 06:05.364
&gt;&gt; AAH! THEY HAVE A FRIDGE

06:05.431 --> 06:07.033
FULL OF SNAKES HERE.

06:07.100 --> 06:15.041
THIS PLACE IS AWESOME.

06:15.108 --> 06:17.243
[ELEVATOR DING]

06:17.310 --> 06:18.244
&gt;&gt; CHECK IT OUT, OSCAR,

06:18.311 --> 06:19.612
I TINKLED IN AND AROUND

06:19.679 --> 06:21.814
A SOLID GOLD TOILET.

06:21.881 --> 06:22.548
&gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO SORT MAIL

06:22.615 --> 06:23.983
AND PRETEND I DIDN'T HEAR YOU.

06:24.050 --> 06:25.218
&gt;&gt; AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE?

06:25.284 --> 06:26.886
I GOT TO MEET A PRINCE.

06:26.953 --> 06:27.653
&gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT THINKING ABOUT

06:27.720 --> 06:28.221
MARRYING HIM

06:28.287 --> 06:29.021
AND BECOMING A PRINCESS,

06:29.088 --> 06:29.722
ARE YOU?

06:29.789 --> 06:30.656
&gt;&gt; OF COURSE NOT.

06:30.723 --> 06:32.291
&gt;&gt; GOOD, 'CAUSE I WAS.
