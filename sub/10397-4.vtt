<i>You can't stop it.</i>

01:47.858 --> 01:49.233
Were you born here?

01:49.234 --> 01:51.193
Yeah. Both generations of my grandparents

01:51.194 --> 01:52.820
from San Francisco.

01:52.821 --> 01:57.116
My dad's side came out for
the Gold Rush, in the 1850s.

02:03.290 --> 02:07.501
When I came here, I was making the same tired jokes

02:07.502 --> 02:11.338
everyone from New York to San Francisco makes.

02:11.339 --> 02:13.382
The granola and the bread.

02:13.383 --> 02:14.842
Yeah.

02:14.843 --> 02:18.220
In fact, nothing can be further from the truth.

02:18.221 --> 02:21.432
<i>San Francisco is an outrageously dirty town.</i>

02:21.433 --> 02:23.309
<i>It's grimy.</i>

02:23.310 --> 02:27.438
<i>You guys have actual street
hookers in this center of town.</i>

02:37.157 --> 02:38.783
Yes, but it's vanishing.

02:38.784 --> 02:41.535
Google is not too far from here.

02:41.536 --> 02:44.455
<i>According to many locals, the

02:55.801 --> 02:59.846
No place epitomizes that
better than where we are now.

02:59.847 --> 03:01.973
I tell anyone to come and meet me here,

03:01.974 --> 03:06.019
they sort of laugh at me.

03:06.020 --> 03:08.062
It's this thing that doesn't really exist

03:08.063 --> 03:09.647
in San Francisco anymore.

03:09.648 --> 03:12.608
It's not self-consciously diving,

03:12.609 --> 03:16.487
It has this faded worn out, smells kind of sour.

03:16.488 --> 03:20.700

03:32.211 --> 03:36.215
My mom used to come here and was a secretary.

03:36.216 --> 03:41.095
There was a place that catered
to unglamorous office workers.

03:41.096 --> 03:43.764
Those are rarer and rarer.

03:43.765 --> 03:46.894
- Is the relentless wheel of history going to roll
- over this place?

03:46.897 --> 03:49.687
Yeah, it will eventually roll over this place.

03:49.688 --> 03:51.522
The location is too good.

03:51.523 --> 03:53.691
One of the best views in San Francisco.

<i>A last drink or two before the grinding wheels</i>

terminal here, is that right?

04:05.037 --> 04:07.663
Yeah. They want to build a fancy ferry terminal.

04:07.664 --> 04:09.999
Young people coming here in the tech industry

04:10.000 --> 04:15.129
are insulated from the culture of San Francisco.

04:15.130 --> 04:21.635
<i>Since the Beat Generation or the Second World War,</i>

04:21.636 --> 04:23.221

<i>in their 20s to do a very specific thing.</i>

04:26.600 --> 04:29.227
<i>San Francisco is a place you can have an acid trip</i>

04:29.228 --> 04:32.980
<i>and see the kind of thing you thought about</i>

04:32.981 --> 04:35.733
yourself is kind of bullshit.

04:35.734 --> 04:41.280
Even though culture is changing
and horrifyingly expensive...

04:41.281 --> 04:42.489
Right.

04:42.490 --> 04:43.574
There is still something like that

04:43.575 --> 04:45.118
that exists in San Francisco.

04:45.119 --> 04:46.660
You will always have that.

04:46.661 --> 04:49.372
San Francisco will always

05:01.260 --> 05:06.430
<i>San Francisco was built on toughness.</i>

05:06.431 --> 05:08.808
<i>It's a boozy town, a saloon town.</i>

05:08.809 --> 05:12.146
<i>Red meat, sex and dirt.</i>

05:13.981 --> 05:16.565
<i>Every morning, every morning,</i>

05:16.566 --> 05:19.485
<i>7:00 a.m., I'm here.</i>

<i>For the next hour or two hours</i>

05:21.947 --> 05:26.533
<i>or sometimes more, I'm just getting crushed.</i>

05:26.534 --> 05:31.705
<i>Humility, Jiu-jitsu gives you that, in spades.</i>

05:31.706 --> 05:36.252
<i>In 1914, Mitsuyo Maeda, a master prizefighter,</i>

<i>emigrated to Brazil.</i>

05:38.130 --> 05:41.757

<i>My home academy is Renzo Gracie in Manhattan.</i>

05:53.352 --> 05:55.980
<i>I'm telling you because the

06:05.657 --> 06:07.200
<i>...and most admired.</i>

06:07.201 --> 06:09.451
<i>To a great extent because of the relationship</i>

<i>between the terrifying Ralph...</i>

06:11.370 --> 06:13.831
<i>Gracie looks at you like he's got a problem.</i>

06:13.832 --> 06:16.834
<i>Those eyes are menacing.</i>

06:16.835 --> 06:18.752
<i>...and this man, Kurt Osiander,</i>

06:18.753 --> 06:21.463
<i>the beloved figure in the Jiu-jitsu community</i>

06:26.636 --> 06:32.432
So, he gets stuck and he gave the guy an underhook.

06:32.433 --> 06:38.106
A long time ago, it's so bad now
you have to work really hard.

06:40.275 --> 06:43.027
To my knees, head up!

06:43.028 --> 06:47.240
Getting some control over the other guy.

<i>When you see an MMA fight,</i>

<i>boxing or muay thai or karate.</i>

06:52.537 --> 06:54.788
<i>When they throw or trip their opponent,</i>

06:54.789 --> 06:56.249
<i>it's judo or wrestling,</i>

06:56.250 --> 06:58.000
<i>but when it hits the ground,</i>

06:58.001 --> 07:01.754
<i>you better know Brazilian Jiu-jitsu.</i>

07:13.641 --> 07:17.311
<i>That's bad. It sucks.</i>

<i>Then, as they say, my choices become very limited.</i>

07:33.412 --> 07:36.748
<i>It's tap, snap, or natural.</i>

07:41.044 --> 07:42.878
You have his pants,

07:42.879 --> 07:45.881
now start to rotate and extend your arm.

07:45.882 --> 07:47.716
Don't lift him up.

07:47.717 --> 07:49.718
Put your head this way, extend this arm.

07:49.719 --> 07:52.638
Yes, pass it.

07:52.639 --> 07:53.639
Hands a little bit tight.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.516
You can always adjust it.

08:07.070 --> 08:08.446
<i>In case you haven't noticed,</i>

<i>And places like this.</i>

08:21.876 --> 08:24.128
I'm fully aware of the fact...

08:24.129 --> 08:25.921
I can hear it already...

08:25.922 --> 08:30.843
Every show you've ever done in
San Francisco, you come here.

08:30.844 --> 08:32.219
Yes. That's correct.

08:32.220 --> 08:34.138

Good morning.

08:38.558 --> 08:40.144
What am I having?

08:40.145 --> 08:41.854
- I'm having crab back of course.
- I'll get you one.

08:41.855 --> 08:43.688

I'm like a Real Housewife of New York City,

08:48.653 --> 08:51.364
I drink only vodka, because it's low carb.

08:51.365 --> 08:53.407
<i>And I eat shellfish.</i>

08:53.408 --> 08:57.453
Look at the size of that one!

08:57.454 --> 08:59.873
Here it is, a crab back!

09:01.500 --> 09:03.502
Dude!

09:05.504 --> 09:07.546
I guess somebody throws this away,

09:07.547 --> 09:10.590
tear the legs off and eat them and throw this out,

09:10.591 --> 09:13.552
stupid people, all that good stuff,

09:13.553 --> 09:18.391
the grains and fat and magic,

Sweet! Nice plate of crab legs,

09:37.994 --> 09:39.995
maybe a little Louie on the side?

09:39.996 --> 09:42.957
I guess.

09:46.211 --> 09:48.463
So good.

09:50.507 --> 09:52.466
Tony, here you go, babe.

09:52.467 --> 09:53.926

09:53.927 --> 09:55.929
I got local Tomales Miyagis.

09:59.599 --> 10:01.392
I should eat these before training.

10:01.393 --> 10:04.103
Gives me super human strength.

10:04.104 --> 10:05.854
On the other hand, coughing up oysters all

10:05.855 --> 10:08.775

10:45.145 --> 10:46.812
I definitely need the drinks menu.

10:46.813 --> 10:51.358
I've been beaten like a chicken fried steak.

10:51.359 --> 10:54.736
You were doing some sort of martial art, too.

10:54.737 --> 10:56.822

10:56.823 --> 10:57.864
What's the mai tai wave?

10:57.865 --> 10:59.158
It's a flight of mai tais.

10:59.159 --> 11:00.951
Really?

11:00.952 --> 11:02.702
It's a surfboard with three different mai tais.

11:02.703 --> 11:05.623
<i>Not many places left that do this.</i>

11:05.624 --> 11:09.084

11:09.085 --> 11:10.628
This is not the first time you have been here?

11:10.629 --> 11:12.421
No, I practically grew up in this place.

11:12.422 --> 11:13.797
Really?

11:13.798 --> 11:15.882
My parents used to take me from like age 3.

11:15.883 --> 11:19.512
It was like a home at Trader Vic's.

11:26.144 --> 11:28.770
<i>I used to drop acid and go to Hawaii Kai,</i>

11:32.984 --> 11:35.194
Oh, yeah.

11:35.195 --> 11:38.572
I got sent to boarding school
when I was a teenager.

11:38.573 --> 11:39.906
East Coast boarding school,

11:39.907 --> 11:42.284
everybody's like, you're from the Gay Bay.

11:42.285 --> 11:44.995
It was really difficult to

11:44.996 --> 11:47.039
negotiate being from San Francisco.

11:47.040 --> 11:50.668
I would lie and say I was from
Napa because I was embarrassed.

11:50.669 --> 11:52.127
Really?

11:52.128 --> 11:55.673
I was at like a hockey school in Massachusetts.

11:55.674 --> 11:59.343
I was going to get hazed for
being from San Francisco.

11:59.344 --> 12:01.845
So San Francisco for you as a kid was...

12:01.846 --> 12:04.598
I remember all sorts of factions,

12:04.599 --> 12:07.059
like skinheads and skaters,

12:07.060 --> 12:09.269
from the teenager's point of view,

12:09.270 --> 12:12.898
and hippies and slightly older beatniks.

12:12.899 --> 12:14.732
Everything was cheap.

12:14.733 --> 12:17.777
I don't think San Francisco
became an expensive rental town

12:17.778 --> 12:21.032
until maybe the last 10 years.

12:27.997 --> 12:30.832
<i>I love this Pan Pacific...</i>

12:35.088 --> 12:36.256
Right.

12:46.391 --> 12:47.433
It's really good.

12:47.434 --> 12:48.475
It's really good.

12:48.476 --> 12:49.435
Do you want that rib?

12:49.436 --> 12:50.477
No.

12:50.478 --> 12:52.563
I'm taking it.

12:52.564 --> 12:58.277
The narrative is evil techies
are coming in and pushing out

12:58.278 --> 13:01.363
the mom and pop restaurants.

13:01.364 --> 13:04.450
That's a true thing.

13:04.451 --> 13:08.912
People everyone hates is Google
now, Google and Twitter?

13:08.913 --> 13:11.831
They're really hated, only by certain people.

13:11.832 --> 13:14.960
Outside San Francisco they're like heroes,

13:14.961 --> 13:16.253
they changed the world.

13:16.254 --> 13:17.379
Yeah!

13:17.380 --> 13:18.422
We like them fine.

13:18.423 --> 13:20.716
I google things.

13:20.717 --> 13:23.552
Legitimate.

13:23.553 --> 13:24.802
I google things, too.

13:24.803 --> 13:26.555
I do. It happens, right?

13:26.556 --> 13:27.640
Look...

13:27.641 --> 13:28.890
Excuse me.

13:28.891 --> 13:30.768
Google, they have their own buses,

13:30.769 --> 13:33.646
which is apparently a bone
of contention for people?

13:33.647 --> 13:36.732
It is. Well, the buses...

13:36.733 --> 13:39.443
Apparently if you work at Google or Twitter,

13:39.444 --> 13:43.863
lunch is freshly made frittatas.

13:43.864 --> 13:46.617
Italian housewife making...

13:46.618 --> 13:48.201
Someone making kale smoothies.

13:48.202 --> 13:50.203
I don't have any problem with it at all.

13:50.204 --> 13:52.331
I don't really either.

13:52.332 --> 13:54.916
I don't have a problem with that stuff at all.

13:54.917 --> 13:58.920
I think the only point about
like the way the city is

13:58.921 --> 14:02.257
changing is, you know, just what was cool about it?

14:02.258 --> 14:05.135
The city has a personality.

14:05.136 --> 14:09.014
It feels like a seedy old-school
American city, you know.

14:09.015 --> 14:12.601
Do you want it to be the same everywhere you go?

14:12.602 --> 14:15.938
The San Francisco right now is a pretty nice city.

14:29.452 --> 14:33.539
<i>It took me six months to be
able to handle the warm-ups</i>

14:33.540 --> 14:35.415
<i>back at my home academy.</i>

14:35.416 --> 14:38.960
<i>For a long time after I just
prayed somebody would be more</i>

14:38.961 --> 14:41.129
<i>out of shape than me.</i>

14:41.130 --> 14:44.508
<i>The warm-ups at house are legendarily tough.</i>

14:44.509 --> 14:45.843
<i>They're proud of it, lasting in</i>

14:45.844 --> 14:47.969
<i>some classes, they say, a half</i>

14:47.970 --> 14:50.180
<i>hour and beyond, a ferocious</i>

14:50.181 --> 14:53.351
<i>unrelenting interval training.</i>

15:10.284 --> 15:12.786
You go a block over, you're at Alamo Square,

15:12.787 --> 15:15.997
that's where the <i> Full House</i> are.

15:15.998 --> 15:17.457
It's super high-end real estate.

15:17.458 --> 15:20.335
But... five years ago, it there was

15:20.336 --> 15:23.881
like the hood and changed a lot.

15:23.882 --> 15:26.174
This is 4505 meats.

15:26.175 --> 15:29.302
They started off... Ryan would be
on the street, outside a bar,

15:29.303 --> 15:32.848
with a Weber grill and built up

15:32.849 --> 15:34.850
the business as the reputation

15:34.851 --> 15:36.685
best hamburger in the city and

15:36.686 --> 15:37.936
then he opened up this place.

15:37.937 --> 15:39.606
It's really good.

15:50.533 --> 15:52.117
Wow.

15:52.118 --> 15:54.578
It's a little of everything,
our presidential platter,

15:54.579 --> 15:56.830
jalapeño and cheddar sausage.

15:56.831 --> 16:00.333
Our frank-a-ronis on top of a hot dog.

16:00.334 --> 16:03.378
Oh, that's wrong. I want it.

16:03.379 --> 16:09.175
Ribs, brisket, chicken, the
hog we were cooking earlier.

16:09.176 --> 16:11.261
Beans, potato salad and coleslaw.

16:11.262 --> 16:14.097
Very very good. Thank you.

16:14.098 --> 16:16.058
Thanks, man. Wow.

16:18.018 --> 16:19.937
How long have you been in the
restaurant business total?

16:19.938 --> 16:21.647
17 years now.

16:21.648 --> 16:26.944
You have become reluctantly, I'm
sure, sort of the poster boy

16:26.945 --> 16:29.028
for the beleaguered victimized

16:29.029 --> 16:32.449
by tech money, what's happening

16:32.450 --> 16:34.075
in San Francisco as a whole?

16:34.076 --> 16:35.994
Yeah, there's definitely good guys and bad guys

16:35.995 --> 16:38.246
and lots of people that came
in now who haven't paid any

16:38.247 --> 16:41.207
dues can open something right away,

16:41.208 --> 16:44.419
drop $4 million in it or something.

16:44.420 --> 16:47.589
<i>Over the course of five years, Richie built his</i>

16:47.590 --> 16:51.969
<i>restaurant Hop-a-ramen into
a beloved local favorite.</i>

16:51.970 --> 16:55.305
<i>Then he made a deal to open a brick and mortar Hop.</i>

16:55.306 --> 16:59.142
<i>With that money came expectations and only four</i>

16:59.143 --> 17:01.979
<i>months in the shit hit the</i> fan.

17:01.980 --> 17:03.522
If you're going to open a restaurant,

17:03.523 --> 17:04.815
you're not going to make money.

17:04.816 --> 17:06.023
And that's when the trouble started.

17:06.025 --> 17:09.277
Who makes money in a year?

17:09.278 --> 17:12.238
30 days we were facing those sorts of things.

17:12.239 --> 17:16.910
<i>The money wanted to make some
changes, Richie did not.</i>

17:16.911 --> 17:18.996
<i>So he left.</i>

17:18.997 --> 17:21.373
<i>The restaurant he created vaporized with him.</i>

17:21.374 --> 17:24.125
At the old space we operated out of,

17:24.126 --> 17:26.252
they're doing a vegan brunch there now.

17:26.252 --> 17:27.921
No way.

17:27.922 --> 17:30.924
It really is the perfect story
of evil triumphs over good.

17:30.925 --> 17:33.927
The problem is there is a lot

17:33.928 --> 17:35.762
of people have the means to open

17:35.763 --> 17:37.890
a restaurant and sort of open

17:37.891 --> 17:41.476
formula restaurant, safe.

17:41.477 --> 17:43.854
Any interesting food will get

17:43.855 --> 17:46.899
forced out and be a town full of

17:46.900 --> 17:48.860
Chipotles.

18:04.834 --> 18:06.001
Thank you.

18:06.002 --> 18:07.127
You're welcome.

18:14.218 --> 18:17.387
<i>Now, when you're a white belt,
especially a 59-year-old</i>

18:17.388 --> 18:18.847
<i>white belt facing younger,</i>

18:18.848 --> 18:20.933
<i>stronger, far better competitors,</i>

18:20.934 --> 18:23.184

18:23.185 --> 18:27.981

18:27.982 --> 18:31.526
<i>If I can hold on, break their

18:31.527 --> 18:33.445
<i>anything to think about before</i>

18:33.446 --> 18:36.407
<i>they choke me out and I have to tap.</i>

18:46.876 --> 18:49.795
<i>The changes are not just
happening in San Francisco,</i>

18:49.796 --> 18:51.337
<i>across the bay in Oakland,</i>

18:51.338 --> 18:52.965
<i>gentrification is met with one</i>

<i>would think a starker history of resistance.</i>

18:56.135 --> 19:00.014
<i>This after all is where the
Black Panthers were born.</i>

19:03.517 --> 19:06.519
<i>Bobby Seale was a founder of the Black Panthers,</i>

19:06.520 --> 19:09.564
<i>a critical figure in Oakland history.</i>

19:09.565 --> 19:13.735
<i>And here at Miss Ollie's, you</i> get a taste of

19:13.736 --> 19:15.528
<i>the shiny new Oakland.</i>

19:15.529 --> 19:17.614
The black panther is a type of
animal, if you push it into a

19:17.615 --> 19:20.366
corner it will try to move out of your way.

19:20.367 --> 19:22.619
If you keep pushing it, sooner
or later it will come out of

19:22.620 --> 19:23.703
that corner.

19:23.704 --> 19:26.999
Said, that's like black people.

19:27.000 --> 19:30.043
We came up with the Black Panther party and take a

19:30.044 --> 19:32.088
position of self-defense.

19:34.548 --> 19:40.929
<i>The Panthers were viewed by the
FBI as public enemy number 1.</i>

19:40.930 --> 19:44.223
<i>They sold the Panthers as the enemy, using your own</i>

19:44.224 --> 19:48.311
<i>imagery, strong black men holding weapons.</i>

19:48.312 --> 19:52.774
<i>What Nixon saw as the real
threat from the Panthers...</i>

19:52.775 --> 19:56.903
Popularity, with the killing of Martin Luther King,

19:56.904 --> 19:59.656
my organization spread across the country.

19:59.657 --> 20:02.868
It went beyond the Black Panther party.

20:02.869 --> 20:06.538
<i>The Panther's aims were, by
today's standards, shockingly</i>

20:06.539 --> 20:10.500
<i>moderate, equality in housing,
education, employment</i>

20:10.501 --> 20:12.085
<i>and basic civil rights.</i>

20:12.086 --> 20:14.129
<i>But the image of black men with guns</i>

20:14.130 --> 20:18.424
<i>was too much for the America of 1966.</i>

20:18.425 --> 20:23.388
Right after Nixon was sworn
in, I got the Watergate tape.

20:23.389 --> 20:27.559
"J. Edgar, you've got to get
rid of those Black Panthers."

20:27.560 --> 20:30.228
"What are you doing? How have you been doing this?"

20:30.229 --> 20:32.064
"I want you to move and get
rid of the Black Panthers."

20:32.065 --> 20:36.735
The man's just been sworn, the
president of the United States.

20:36.736 --> 20:38.444
<i>Raids are launched on Panthers strong points</i>

20:38.445 --> 20:41.823
<i>around the country, arrests are many.</i>

20:41.824 --> 20:43.534
<i>The FBI did everything they</i>

20:43.535 --> 20:45.243
<i>could to eradicate them.</i>

20:45.244 --> 20:46.349
<i>The Panthers say the</i>

20:46.350 --> 20:47.453
<i>police have broken in</i>

20:47.454 --> 20:51.457
<i>and killed one man at close range as he slept.</i>

20:51.458 --> 20:54.086
The dismantling of the Panthers was brutal,

20:54.087 --> 20:57.505
everybody believes an assassination campaign

20:57.506 --> 21:01.843
coupled with murder and arrests.

21:01.844 --> 21:04.930
We had no charges, nothing,

21:04.931 --> 21:07.891
they created, through their
counter-intelligence program

21:07.892 --> 21:11.436
everything that happened to us.

21:11.437 --> 21:14.022
Are you happy with the level of black activism

21:14.023 --> 21:15.774
in the country now?

21:15.775 --> 21:19.277
I like the level of activism.

21:19.278 --> 21:23.156
And black lives matter movement
is very very important because

21:23.157 --> 21:25.867
there's a bunch of young, intelligent youth

21:25.868 --> 21:27.368
running this operation.

21:27.369 --> 21:29.829
Do you think the good guys are winning?

21:29.830 --> 21:31.539
What?

21:31.540 --> 21:32.832
You look at it the way the
country is running, do you think

21:32.833 --> 21:34.375
the good guys are winning?

21:34.376 --> 21:39.172
The bad guys, the Koch brothers, Tea Party and all

21:39.173 --> 21:43.468
these right wing idiots are so far winning.

21:43.469 --> 21:46.805
Young people have got to go
out there and be progressive

21:46.806 --> 21:51.684
enough not only to end police
brutality but create frameworks

21:51.685 --> 21:53.895
and demanding no.

21:53.896 --> 21:56.857
These are the kinds of things that has to happen.

22:16.543 --> 22:19.171
Curry and cauliflower, it's Indian-Chinese,

22:19.172 --> 22:23.466
like General's Chicken made with vegetables.

22:23.467 --> 22:26.052
It's one of our most popular
dishes, vegetable candy.

22:26.053 --> 22:29.430
<i>Juhu Beach Club, in a strip
mall in Oakland's Temescal</i>

but delicious new addition</i>

22:33.019 --> 22:36.353
<i>started by this woman Preeti Mistry.</i>

22:36.354 --> 22:39.065
Ah, so good.

22:39.066 --> 22:41.484
I know you've been to India several times.

22:41.485 --> 22:44.779
Maybe you had the puffed rice?

22:44.780 --> 22:46.281
Yes, yes.

22:46.282 --> 22:51.953
We're in Oakland and we serve it in a ball jar.

22:51.954 --> 22:56.082
Tamarind, chutney, cilantro
chutney, pickled cabbage,

22:56.083 --> 22:59.294
pickled onions, fresh green garbanzo beans,

22:59.295 --> 23:03.174
puffed rice and chickpea noodles.

23:11.098 --> 23:14.976
Oakland now, in terms of like artists and chefs

23:14.977 --> 23:18.521
has basically, kids have been
priced out of San Francisco.

23:18.522 --> 23:21.900
It's still possible for a place
like this basically funded

23:21.901 --> 23:24.986
by Preeti and her wife, to open up.

23:24.987 --> 23:26.612
In San Francisco,

23:26.613 --> 23:28.447
I don't think it's really
possible anymore to do that.

23:28.448 --> 23:29.908
You need big investors.

23:29.909 --> 23:31.868
You need lots of funding.

23:31.869 --> 23:35.080
<i>The food is both familiar and uniquely her own.</i>

23:35.081 --> 23:37.374
Chili paneer is one of my favorites.

23:37.375 --> 23:41.920
It has bok choy, and other items,

23:41.921 --> 23:45.924
none of which would traditionally be in it.

23:45.925 --> 23:49.594
Does authenticity have any meaning or relevance

23:49.595 --> 23:50.970
anymore at all?

23:50.971 --> 23:53.098
I would say our food is not traditional.

23:53.099 --> 23:54.473
Is it authentic? Hell, yeah,

23:54.474 --> 23:56.268
100% authentic.

23:56.269 --> 24:01.731
Saying it's not authentic is a
person of Indian origin in the

24:01.732 --> 24:03.275
United States is not authentic.

24:03.276 --> 24:06.778
I grew up eating Indian food
and pizza and hamburgers

24:06.779 --> 24:09.948
at the same time.

24:09.949 --> 24:12.242
So tasty.

24:12.243 --> 24:13.868
Something we struggle with in New York

24:13.869 --> 24:18.415
is how do you value Indian food?

24:18.416 --> 24:19.999
Yeah, totally.

24:20.000 --> 24:23.253
The expectation is you get
authentic Indian food cheap.

24:23.254 --> 24:25.130
Super cheap.

24:25.131 --> 24:26.547
Our food is not cheap.

24:26.548 --> 24:30.427
At Yelp review, it is said we are overpriced.

24:30.428 --> 24:32.262
$19 for a curry.

24:32.263 --> 24:36.516
Do you know how to make a curry?

24:38.644 --> 24:40.561
<i>Yogurt marinated chicken simmered</i>

24:40.562 --> 24:43.564
<i>in a curry made of onions, bell peppers, chilies</i>

24:43.565 --> 24:45.317
<i>and garam masala.</i>

24:45.318 --> 24:48.403
All right!

24:48.404 --> 24:50.447
This is our chicken curry,

24:50.448 --> 24:52.949
braised on the bone.

24:52.950 --> 24:55.618
Butter, fresh red peppers in there.

24:55.619 --> 24:57.787
That's totally delicious.

24:57.788 --> 25:01.124
This guy right here, you want to cut it open.

25:01.125 --> 25:05.044
Get the camera in over, right here.

25:05.045 --> 25:07.339
Prepare the incision.

25:07.340 --> 25:09.215
Whoa!

25:09.216 --> 25:12.593
Some people say its an Indian scotch egg.

25:12.594 --> 25:17.140
We invented the scotch egg, they didn't.

25:17.141 --> 25:19.434
We took a duck egg, cooked it,

25:19.435 --> 25:21.644
kept it soft, wrapped it in lamb

25:21.645 --> 25:26.275
and the sauce has braised leg of lamb in it.

25:28.652 --> 25:30.069
Wow.

25:30.070 --> 25:32.655
Really extraordinarily delicious.

25:32.656 --> 25:35.492
So, this is a positive thing.

25:35.493 --> 25:37.576
Yeah. I think this is positive.

25:37.577 --> 25:39.329
A change we like?

25:39.330 --> 25:40.788
This is kind of change we like.

25:40.789 --> 25:43.540
I believe any place that serves delicious food

25:43.541 --> 25:44.918
is on the side of the angels.

26:30.630 --> 26:33.425
Extend your arm.

26:33.426 --> 26:35.843
Your other arm.

26:35.844 --> 26:39.390
The other arm is anchored wrong, like this.

26:56.782 --> 27:01.453
Did you see the vacant lot across the street?

27:01.454 --> 27:06.707
That was San Jose Chinatown built in 1887.

27:06.708 --> 27:07.792
That was first.

27:07.793 --> 27:09.043
That was first.

27:09.044 --> 27:10.002
A Chinese community first.

27:10.003 --> 27:11.879
Right.

27:11.880 --> 27:16.384
1890 was when some of the first
Japanese arrived in this area.

27:16.385 --> 27:19.137
<i>South Bay San Jose, not much</i>

27:19.138 --> 27:21.222
<i>going on out here other than</i>

27:21.223 --> 27:22.515
<i>world domination by a small</i>

27:22.516 --> 27:24.267
<i>group of tech companies.</i>

27:24.268 --> 27:26.727
<i>On a happier less paranoid note,</i>

27:26.728 --> 27:30.231
<i>San Jose has one of the last</i>
three Japantowns in the

27:30.232 --> 27:31.941
<i>country.</i>

27:31.942 --> 27:33.859
Who were the first Japanese to come over?

27:33.860 --> 27:37.905
Students, laborers looking for a better life.

27:37.906 --> 27:39.491
In traditional Japanese families

27:39.492 --> 27:42.785
the first son inherited everything.

27:42.786 --> 27:44.954
Generally, it was the second son

27:44.955 --> 27:48.541
who would get nothing who came over.

27:48.542 --> 27:52.086
When the first Japanese came
here, one of the places they

27:52.087 --> 27:54.213
stayed at was Chinatown.

27:54.214 --> 27:56.508
You would have an Asian community.

27:56.509 --> 28:00.845
They would be able to find
food similar to Japanese food

28:00.846 --> 28:03.556
and there'd be a comrade.

28:03.557 --> 28:06.476
Thank you.

28:06.477 --> 28:08.978
<i>Curt Fukuda grew up in the area.</i>

28:08.979 --> 28:10.980
<i>His family, like thousands of</i>

28:10.981 --> 28:12.773
<i>other Japanese Americans, were</i>

28:12.774 --> 28:16.277
<i>interned in camps in World War II.</i>

28:16.278 --> 28:18.404
In the beginning of the 20th
Century there was a lot of

28:18.405 --> 28:20.365
anti-Asian prejudice.

28:20.366 --> 28:23.660
Too many taking our jobs.

28:23.661 --> 28:25.411
Some of them were buying our land.

28:25.412 --> 28:30.249
Things got really bad for
Japanese after Pearl Harbor.

28:30.250 --> 28:33.003
It was an internment program.

28:34.421 --> 28:36.548
So they had a list of all the names.

28:36.549 --> 28:38.174
Kids, too.

28:38.175 --> 28:41.302
Children, too, they all had
to go walking to the train

28:41.303 --> 28:44.763
station in downtown San Jose.

28:44.764 --> 28:47.058
My mother did say in the

28:47.059 --> 28:48.142
beginning before they were

28:48.143 --> 28:49.268
brought to the camps they were

28:49.269 --> 28:50.687
brought to assembly centers

28:50.688 --> 28:53.523
while the camps were being built.

28:53.524 --> 28:58.695
It was the racetrack at Santa
Anita and said they were

28:58.696 --> 29:01.531
actually sleeping in horse stalls.

29:01.532 --> 29:03.449
What happened to their property?

29:03.450 --> 29:07.078
Some of the people found
Caucasian friends to look over

29:07.079 --> 29:09.539
the property while they were gone.

29:09.540 --> 29:13.751
Some of the Japanese actually dug
holes and buried possessions

29:13.752 --> 29:15.587
hoping if they come back...

29:15.588 --> 29:16.713
They can dig it up.

29:16.714 --> 29:18.715
They can dig it up. Yes.

29:18.716 --> 29:21.092
Oh, wow.

29:21.093 --> 29:24.011
That brown gravy, awesome.

29:24.012 --> 29:25.513
It's sort of a hybrid of

29:25.514 --> 29:27.848
American dishes but with

29:27.849 --> 29:29.767
Japanese ingredients.

29:29.768 --> 29:31.185
Yes.

29:31.186 --> 29:34.564
This is your typical Japantown restaurant food.

29:34.565 --> 29:35.648
I think some of the

29:35.649 --> 29:36.899
heartbreak of the internment,

29:36.900 --> 29:42.238
this was really pure Americana.

29:42.239 --> 29:46.117
The faces were Asian but the
businesses and feel was

29:46.118 --> 29:47.076
Mayberry.

29:47.077 --> 29:49.370
Right.

29:49.371 --> 29:51.830
This was a Japanese-American community

29:51.831 --> 29:56.210
with emphasis on American.

29:56.211 --> 30:00.214
The Japanese are actually a
minority in this community now.

30:00.215 --> 30:03.593
How Japanese will it be in 30 years?

30:03.594 --> 30:06.137
Ah, that is the question.

30:06.138 --> 30:08.139
I don't think it's good for

30:08.140 --> 30:11.434
anything to just kind of remain frozen in time.

30:11.435 --> 30:13.394
30 years from now, Japantown is

30:13.395 --> 30:14.895
going to look very different.

30:14.896 --> 30:16.272
If it looks like it does right

30:16.273 --> 30:18.566
now then, you know, we're

30:18.567 --> 30:22.571
talking about a very stagnant community.

30:52.518 --> 30:54.727
You've been in the restaurant business now in the

30:54.728 --> 30:55.853
San Francisco area how many years?

30:55.854 --> 30:57.438
26.

30:57.439 --> 31:00.692
Basically you've been feeding well-heeled people

31:00.693 --> 31:02.276
much of that time.

31:02.277 --> 31:03.528
My whole life.

31:03.529 --> 31:05.070

We're starting a fast-food venue.

31:30.764 --> 31:32.264
Why?

31:32.265 --> 31:33.974
It's unbelievable.

31:33.975 --> 31:35.351
Because in our country, there's

31:35.352 --> 31:39.230
so much of it it's okay for

31:39.231 --> 31:42.274
people to eat garbage basically, processed food.

31:42.275 --> 31:47.154
The tenderloin, the worst intersection,

31:50.242 --> 31:52.159

32:12.097 --> 32:16.601

32:16.602 --> 32:20.187
Veggie burger dressed exactly
the same way, if you're like I

32:20.188 --> 32:23.065
am, the word veggie burger will
strike terror in your heart.

32:23.066 --> 32:25.192
Yeah. It makes me violent, actually.

32:25.193 --> 32:27.152
This will not make you violent.

32:27.153 --> 32:28.739
It will make you happy.

32:33.786 --> 32:35.620
Wow. I'd totally eat that.

32:35.621 --> 32:38.163
If you didn't call it a veggie
burger, I'd be all over this.

32:38.164 --> 32:39.248
Yeah.

32:39.249 --> 32:41.083
So fast, healthy and affordable.

32:41.084 --> 32:43.168
Yeah, 2 to $6.

32:43.169 --> 32:45.254
So you're not going to get rich off this venture?

32:45.255 --> 32:46.505
We'll make money.

32:46.506 --> 32:48.299
You will make money? We have to.

32:48.300 --> 32:50.928

my rib this way and my finger went here.

33:16.703 --> 33:21.039
I'm pretty sure Curt hasn't eaten at Coi before.

33:21.040 --> 33:25.169
My finger broke against my 16
ounce glove against my head.

33:25.170 --> 33:27.713
That's how hard this guy punched.

33:27.714 --> 33:30.884

33:53.281 --> 33:55.908
Mm. Oh, this is great.

34:14.636 --> 34:16.554
The egg yolk, it's fully cooked.

34:16.554 --> 34:18.347
It's custard tasting.

34:18.348 --> 34:19.806
A beautiful thing. Thank you.

34:19.808 --> 34:21.893

34:21.893 --> 34:24.687
Oh, yeah.

34:24.688 --> 34:27.773
Man, I could eat more of those.

34:27.774 --> 34:28.940

Yes.

34:35.364 --> 34:36.908
Jiu-jitsu for how long?

34:36.909 --> 34:40.828
Since '93, since before the first UFC.

34:40.829 --> 34:43.539
What was the preeminent martial art at the time?

34:43.540 --> 34:45.666
I think it was karate.

34:45.667 --> 34:47.208
Right?

34:47.210 --> 34:48.753
Chuck Norris was big then,

34:48.754 --> 34:53.550
right, kick people in the head kind of thing.

35:00.557 --> 35:03.059
Cherry tomatoes and the sauce underneath is

grass, herbs and flowers on top.

trash, sorry, is good.

because if you are starving, you

39:26.531 --> 39:29.034
will eat whatever there is at the table.

39:31.203 --> 39:35.747
<i>Plus grilled chicken hearts tri-tip and sausages.</i>

39:35.748 --> 39:37.415
<i>Gotta have sausages.</i>

39:37.416 --> 39:39.877
Do you like it like that, raw-ish?

39:39.878 --> 39:41.170
Love it. Me, too.

39:41.171 --> 39:42.880
I don't like overcooked meat.

39:42.881 --> 39:45.716
No, that's just wrong.

39:45.717 --> 39:48.886
Food is ready!

39:48.887 --> 39:49.928
There you go, bro.

39:49.929 --> 39:51.722
Oh, wow.

39:51.723 --> 39:53.724
You want to open that Macallan?

39:53.725 --> 39:55.059
Hell no.

39:55.060 --> 39:57.102
I have class tomorrow, and you kidding me?

39:57.103 --> 39:58.729
I'll drink that whole bottle

39:58.730 --> 39:59.897
and train with everybody.

39:59.898 --> 40:01.649
You are the guy that still trains.

40:04.485 --> 40:06.653
As soon as I started doing Jiu-jitsu,

40:06.654 --> 40:10.324
it hit a part of my psyche that, OK, it's

40:10.325 --> 40:14.286
challenging and more than brute force

40:14.287 --> 40:16.747
and you have to think.

40:16.748 --> 40:20.084
I was the guy if you were
the old lady that hired me

40:20.085 --> 40:22.336
to shovel the walk, I would do half of it

40:22.337 --> 40:26.215
and realize that it is too hard and just disappear.

40:26.216 --> 40:30.302
I cannot think of another thing
that I attacked with such

40:30.303 --> 40:35.140
regularity and with such... I

40:35.141 --> 40:37.017
mean, I have been steadfast.

40:37.018 --> 40:40.104
It is not a matter of if you're good enough.

40:40.105 --> 40:42.732
Sometimes, it has to deal with maturity.

40:46.652 --> 40:50.239
<i>The old tends to get run over by the new.</i>

40:50.240 --> 40:51.698
<i>That is how it works.</i>

40:51.699 --> 40:52.908
<i>Whether it is San Francisco</i>

40:52.909 --> 40:54.534
<i>invaded by a new generation of</i>

40:54.535 --> 40:56.745
<i>people with different priorities,</i>

40:56.746 --> 40:58.789
<i>or a 59-year-old man grappling</i>

40:58.790 --> 41:00.916
<i>with a bunch of younger and</i>

41:00.917 --> 41:04.753
<i>tougher and hungrier bastards.</i>

41:04.754 --> 41:05.963
<i>But I don't know.</i>

41:05.964 --> 41:07.672
<i>I like to think that there is a</i>

41:07.673 --> 41:08.966
<i>hope, at a least hope that every</i>

41:08.967 --> 41:11.051
<i>once in a while, the old guys</i>

41:11.052 --> 41:12.886
<i>will have a good day.</i>

41:12.887 --> 41:14.806
♪

41:39.164 --> 41:42.833
Oh, my God.

41:42.834 --> 41:43.835
That was beautiful.
