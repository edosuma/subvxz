00:07.746 --> 00:09.139

brought breakfast.

00:15.841 --> 00:18.279
- I could get Belgian waffles.
From Brussels.

00:18.322 --> 00:19.758
- Yum, that sounds incredible.

00:19.802 --> 00:20.846
- Yeah? Should I do it?

00:20.890 --> 00:22.370
- Okay, no, no, no, no, no.

First, there's something

00:31.596 --> 00:33.294
we really need to tell you.

00:33.337 --> 00:36.079
- And we wanted our closest
friends to hear it first.

00:36.123 --> 00:37.428
- Are you guys pregnant?

00:37.472 --> 00:39.039
- Wait, is this about
another big bad?

00:39.082 --> 00:40.692
- I'll call
Chester and Allegra.

00:40.736 --> 00:44.000
- No, no, and definitely not.

00:44.044 --> 00:48.787
What we wanted to say is...

00:48.831 --> 00:50.963
We're leaving
Central City.

00:53.966 --> 00:55.272

A.R.G.U.S. offered me the job.

they really needed me

great opportunities for us.

Chester a couple things

08:32.947 --> 08:35.427

08:35.471 --> 08:39.214
Somehow our suspect got Ellis
to give her a cashier's check,

08:39.257 --> 08:40.389
then she strolled
out of the bank

08:40.432 --> 08:41.956
and drove off in a blue van.

08:41.999 --> 08:44.567

so weirdly happy,

08:58.233 --> 09:00.235
She makes people euphoric.

09:00.278 --> 09:02.280
Take a look
at Ellis' brain scan.

09:02.324 --> 09:04.935
- So she controls
people's cingulate cortexes.

09:04.979 --> 09:06.589
- Yes, which is why
there's such huge levels

09:06.633 --> 09:08.765
of dopamine and serotonin
in his scan.

09:08.809 --> 09:11.028
- These levels are definitely
enough to make him

09:11.072 --> 09:13.509

to suggestion.

09:13.553 --> 09:16.860
- Oh, yeah, he would've done
anything she asked him to do.

09:16.904 --> 09:18.688

is the blissful effects

the chance to solve

09:40.536 --> 09:44.061
one last case together,
now would I?

09:44.105 --> 09:46.716

09:46.760 --> 09:49.893

can handle it ourselves.

09:49.937 --> 09:51.634
- Or,

09:51.678 --> 09:54.245
O.G. Team Flash

Cisco and me leaving.

10:49.518 --> 10:50.867
I would've told you earlier.
It's just,

10:50.911 --> 10:52.347
we wanted to tell you
all together.

10:52.390 --> 10:54.697
- No, don't worry.
We were all so busy.

10:54.741 --> 10:58.745
- Iris, you trusted me to
be the eyes of "The Citizen."

10:58.788 --> 11:00.094
And that gave me the confidence

11:00.137 --> 11:01.878
to take my career
to the next level.

11:01.922 --> 11:04.533
You changed my life
and I'll never forget that.

11:04.576 --> 11:05.795
So thank you.

11:05.839 --> 11:08.058
- You're welcome.

11:08.102 --> 11:09.712
- Now I feel guilty
about leaving you

11:09.756 --> 11:11.409
on such short notice.
- No, it's fine.

11:11.453 --> 11:12.497
Really, really.

11:12.541 --> 11:14.151
- No, it's not.

11:14.195 --> 11:15.979
Well, I know you're seeing
new candidates today.

11:16.023 --> 11:17.633
Maybe I can help you vet them?

11:17.677 --> 11:19.069
- Yeah.
Yeah, that'd be great.

11:19.113 --> 11:21.463
- Great.
- Come on.

11:23.726 --> 11:25.423
- I checked out
Ellis' brain scan

11:25.467 --> 11:27.425
and I had major déjà vu.

11:27.469 --> 11:31.212
Folks, we've been on this exact
emotional rollercoaster before.

11:31.255 --> 11:33.127
Well, sorta.

11:33.170 --> 11:36.913
Last time,
it was Roy G. Bivolo.

11:36.957 --> 11:40.177
- But our new meta
makes people happy, not angry.

11:40.221 --> 11:43.528
- Enter Rainbow Raider 2.0,

11:43.572 --> 11:45.705
which means we already know
how to stop her.

11:45.748 --> 11:47.619
Using that prismatic light grid
I built

11:47.663 --> 11:49.404
to reverse Bivolo's
whammy effects,

11:49.447 --> 11:52.450
we can use it to neutralize
her meta abilities.

11:52.494 --> 11:54.888
Just remember.
Don't make eye contact.

11:56.890 --> 11:59.283
Hey, how many gadgets
do you think we've built

11:59.327 --> 12:01.721
over the years, huh?

12:01.764 --> 12:04.680
Really, when you do the math,

12:04.724 --> 12:06.334
that's a lot of bad guys
we've taken down.

12:06.377 --> 12:07.814
- You know, when you leave,

12:07.857 --> 12:09.772
you should take
all the plans with you.

12:09.816 --> 12:11.643
I mean, I'm sure
everything you've built

12:11.687 --> 12:13.907
must mean a lot to you.

12:16.039 --> 12:17.649
- Yeah, it does.

12:21.566 --> 12:24.091
- Satellite's got a hit
on the van from the robbery.

12:24.134 --> 12:26.397
