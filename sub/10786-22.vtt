WEBVTT

00:01.875 --> 00:03.542
OH, I HATE FINALS.

00:03.542 --> 00:06.083
WHAT KIND OF A SADIST BASES
1/3 OF A SEMESTER'S GRADE

00:06.083 --> 00:07.500
ON WHETHER OR NOT
YOU CAN RECITE THE OPENING

00:07.500 --> 00:09.458
TO THE CANTERBURY TALES
IN PERFECT MIDDLE ENGLISH?

00:09.458 --> 00:11.542
JOEY, WE'VE BEEN OVER
THIS A THOUSAND TIMES.

00:11.542 --> 00:13.834
YOUR PRONUNCIATION
IS FLAWLESS.

00:13.834 --> 00:14.959
MAYBE SO, BUT I'M STILL GONNA
CONTINUE TORTURING MYSELF

00:14.959 --> 00:17.542
UNTIL TEST TIME.
I JUST HAVE TO.

00:17.542 --> 00:18.667
OF COURSE YOU WILL.

00:18.667 --> 00:21.083
I'M WELL AWARE OF
THE POTTER NEUROSES.

00:21.083 --> 00:22.500
I PREFER TO THINK
OF THEM AS QUIRKS.

00:22.500 --> 00:23.500
DO YOU?

00:23.500 --> 00:25.375
YEAH.

00:25.375 --> 00:27.083
WELL, WHATEVER
WORKS FOR YOU.

00:27.083 --> 00:28.917
I COULD GET INTO
THE LEERY NEUROSES.

00:28.917 --> 00:30.083
UH, WE DON'T HAVE
TO DO THAT.

00:30.083 --> 00:34.083
BESIDES, I'M, UH,
NERVOUS ENOUGH

00:34.083 --> 00:35.542
ON MY OWN RIGHT NOW.

00:35.542 --> 00:37.834
WHY?

00:37.834 --> 00:40.834
UH, WELL, THERE'S A...

00:40.834 --> 00:43.959
THERE'S AN EVENT
LOOMING ON THE HORIZON,

00:43.959 --> 00:45.959
AND, UH...

00:45.959 --> 00:47.542
I SEEM TO RECALL
A CERTAIN PACT

00:47.542 --> 00:50.375
MADE BY
2 HIGH-SCHOOL FRESHMEN
REGARDING SAID EVENT.

00:50.375 --> 00:54.041
JUNIOR PROM.
WE BOTH AGREED IF
WE DIDN'T HAVE DATES,

00:54.041 --> 00:55.542
WE'D GO TOGETHER.

00:55.542 --> 00:56.750
SO YOU DO REMEMBER.

00:58.625 --> 00:59.834
ARE YOU ASKING ME
TO PROM?

00:59.834 --> 01:02.417
I DON'T WANT TO GO
WITH SOME RANDOM PERSON

01:02.417 --> 01:05.000
AND HAVE IT
MEAN NOTHING.

01:05.000 --> 01:08.125
YOU KNOW, I WANT TO GO
WITH MY OLDEST FRIEND.

01:08.125 --> 01:09.166
THAT'LL BE SOMETHING
I'LL ALWAYS REMEMBER.

01:11.834 --> 01:14.291
OR WE CAN BOTH AGREE
THAT IT'S A MEANINGLESS EVENT

01:14.291 --> 01:15.500
AND NOT GO AT ALL.

01:15.500 --> 01:17.166
BUT IT DOES
MEAN SOMETHING.

01:17.166 --> 01:18.708
THERE ARE A MILLION
REASONS WHY PROMS ARE
RIDICULOUS AND STUPID,

01:18.708 --> 01:22.542
BUT WE MADE THAT PACT
BECAUSE IT OBVIOUSLY
MATTERED TO US.

01:22.542 --> 01:24.208
IT'S A RITE OF PASSAGE.

01:24.208 --> 01:26.250
AND I CAN'T THINK OF
ANY BETTER WAY
TO MOVE FORWARD

01:26.250 --> 01:29.417
THAN TO FULFILL A PACT
MADE BY 2 OLD FRIENDS

01:29.417 --> 01:31.166
AND JUST HAVE
A GOOD TIME.

01:32.458 --> 01:34.250
OK.

01:34.250 --> 01:35.834
OK.

01:35.834 --> 01:37.291
BUT I HAVE 2 RULES--

01:37.291 --> 01:38.792
NO CHEESY CORSAGE FOR ME

01:38.792 --> 01:41.750
AND NO BLUE RUFFLEY-
TUXEDOEY-SHIRT-THINGY
FOR YOU.

01:41.750 --> 01:43.250
DONE.

01:44.458 --> 01:45.417
Mitch: THAT'S ONE
FOR RIGHT NOW.

01:45.417 --> 01:48.041
Gale: I HAVE TO GET
TO THE RESTAURANT.

01:48.041 --> 01:49.583
YOU DO NOT.

01:49.583 --> 01:50.750
I HAVE TO GO,
HONEY.

01:54.834 --> 01:56.834
Gale: HONEY. AHEM.

02:49.917 --> 02:51.834
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT
WEARING A WATCH,

02:51.834 --> 02:54.000
BUT I'M PROBABLY
AT LEAST LATE

02:54.000 --> 02:55.166
FOR SOMETHING I SHOULD
PROBABLY BE AT,

02:55.166 --> 02:58.375
SO...I'LL SEE
YOU GUYS LATER.

02:58.375 --> 02:59.917
SEE YA.

02:59.917 --> 03:02.834
UH, SWEETHEART,
WE SHOULD PROBABLY

03:02.834 --> 03:05.125
TALK ABOUT
WHAT YOU JUST SAW.

03:05.125 --> 03:08.000
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'LL TALK TO DAWSON.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.667
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY
GO AHEAD AND GET
TO THE RESTAURANT.

03:09.667 --> 03:11.625
OK.

03:14.250 --> 03:15.583
[KISS]

03:20.333 --> 03:21.375
THIS SHOULD BE GOOD.

03:29.417 --> 03:30.542
YOU OK?

03:30.542 --> 03:31.625
[SNORTS]

03:31.625 --> 03:32.083
YOU KNOW WHAT?

03:32.083 --> 03:35.667
YEAH, I AM.

03:35.667 --> 03:37.375
ABOUT WHAT
YOU JUST SAW--

03:37.375 --> 03:39.041
WHAT I JUST SAW, DAD,
WAS SOMETHING I'VE SEEN

03:39.041 --> 03:41.041
ABOUT 5 MILLION TIMES OVER
THE COURSE OF MY LIFE.

03:41.041 --> 03:43.375
BUT UNDER
THE CIRCUMSTANCES,

03:43.375 --> 03:45.083
DON'T YOU THINK WE
SHOULD TALK ABOUT IT?

03:45.083 --> 03:47.375
[LAUGHS]

03:47.375 --> 03:50.375
DAD, AT THIS POINT,
I'M NUMB.

03:50.375 --> 03:51.708
YOU'RE NUMB?

03:51.708 --> 03:55.250
YEAH. I MEAN,
YOU AND MOM HAVE ALWAYS
HAD A RELATIONSHIP

03:55.250 --> 03:57.542
THAT'S BEEN
A LITTLE DRAMATIC.

03:57.542 --> 03:59.375
ALL THE WHILE,
I'VE BEEN IN THE MIDDLE

03:59.375 --> 04:01.375
THROUGH ALL
THE BACKS-AND-FORTHS
AND UPS AND DOWNS,

04:01.375 --> 04:03.458
AND A LITTLE WHILE AGO
I REALIZED I DON'T
NEED TO DO THAT.

04:03.458 --> 04:09.333
I CAN JUST SIT BACK, DETACHED,
AND WATCH FROM AFAR.

04:09.333 --> 04:10.750
YOU CAN DO THAT.

04:10.750 --> 04:13.250
BUT I THINK
YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT
WHAT'S GOING ON

04:13.250 --> 04:16.750
BETWEEN YOUR MOTHER
AND ME IS A LOT MORE
THAN CASUAL.

04:16.750 --> 04:18.916
ARE YOU SAYING
THAT YOU AND MOM ARE
GETTING BACK TOGETHER?

04:18.916 --> 04:21.333
NO. WE HAVEN'T
DISCUSSED THAT.

04:21.333 --> 04:23.208
OK, DAD, IN THAT CASE,
I WOULD PREFER YOU LEFT ME
OUT OF IT ENTIRELY.

04:23.208 --> 04:25.750
I'M ENJOYING THE NUMBNESS.
YOU HAVEN'T TALKED TO MOM,

04:25.750 --> 04:28.000
YOU DON'T KNOW EVEN
WHAT SHE'S FEELING.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.708
I WAS MARRIED TO
YOUR MOTHER FOR 20 YEARS.

04:31.708 --> 04:34.291
THERE'S SOME THINGS I KNOW
WITHOUT HAVING TO ASK.

04:37.083 --> 04:40.208
HOW'S THE STUDYING
GOING?

04:40.208 --> 04:41.792
FINE.

04:41.792 --> 04:43.792
YOU WANT ANYTHING?
CAN I GET YOU WATER?
LEMONADE?

04:43.792 --> 04:47.000
NO. I'M GOOD.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.500
OK.

04:52.792 --> 04:54.125
UM...

04:54.125 --> 04:57.708
DO YOU...
WANT ME TO GO?

04:58.959 --> 05:00.583
WHY WOULD I
WANT YOU TO GO?

05:01.625 --> 05:03.125
I DON'T KNOW.

05:03.125 --> 05:05.583
I JUST GET
THE FEELING THAT...

05:05.583 --> 05:07.792
I DON'T KNOW.
THAT YOU WANT ME TO GO.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.708
UH-UH. I DON'T
WANT YOU TO GO.

05:10.708 --> 05:12.834
OK.

05:15.250 --> 05:20.625
LOOK, I JUST--
SOMETIMES I...

05:20.625 --> 05:22.875
I JUST FEEL KIND OF...

05:22.875 --> 05:24.458
THIRSTY?

05:24.458 --> 05:26.917
TIRED? MAD? SAD?

05:26.917 --> 05:29.250
YEAH.

05:29.250 --> 05:30.166
SAD?

05:30.166 --> 05:33.125
YEAH. UH, IT'S...

05:33.125 --> 05:36.083
SOMETHING
LIKE THAT. YEAH.

05:36.083 --> 05:38.250
MAYBE IT'S TIME THAT YOU
COME OUT OF THIS CAVE,

05:38.250 --> 05:39.750
JUST GET BACK OUT THERE.

05:39.750 --> 05:41.959
BACK OUT WHERE?

05:41.959 --> 05:45.500
OUT THERE. YOU KNOW,
GO TO THE PROM.

05:45.500 --> 05:47.875
WITH WHO, ANDIE?

05:47.875 --> 05:50.083
I DON'T KNOW.
ANYBODY. A GIRL.

05:50.083 --> 05:52.917
YOU COULD GO WITH ME,
IF YOU WANTED TO.

05:52.917 --> 05:55.166
YOU DON'T HAVE A DATE
TO THE PROM?

05:55.166 --> 05:58.125
I AM CURRENTLY
SIFTING THROUGH OFFERS.

05:58.125 --> 05:59.959
I HAVE JUST YET TO MAKE
MY FINAL DECISION.

06:02.500 --> 06:03.834
DO YOU WANT ME
TO ASK YOU TO THE PROM?

06:03.834 --> 06:07.500
[LAUGHS]

06:07.500 --> 06:09.500
I JUST WANT TO SEE YOU
HAPPY AGAIN.

06:09.500 --> 06:12.041
I DON'T THINK THAT
THE PROM IS GOING TO ACT

06:12.041 --> 06:16.083
AS SOME MAGICAL
HAPPINESS ELIXIR FOR ME.

06:16.083 --> 06:18.041
AND YOU'RE PROBABLY
BETTER OFF

06:18.041 --> 06:20.834
TAKING ONE OF THOSE GUYS
UP ON THEIR OFFER.

06:20.834 --> 06:23.041
I'M SURE I WILL.

06:25.375 --> 06:28.041
DAWSON ASKED ME TO PROM,
AND I SAID YES.

06:29.291 --> 06:32.834
AND NOW I FEEL LIKE I MADE
A HUGE HORRIBLE MISTAKE.

06:32.834 --> 06:35.333
I MEAN, HE ASSURED ME
THAT IT WILL ONLY SERVE

06:35.333 --> 06:37.166
TO RE-CEMENT OUR ADMITTEDLY
SHAKY FRIENDSHIP,

06:37.166 --> 06:38.667
BUT...I DON'T KNOW.

06:38.667 --> 06:41.542
WHAT ABOUT THE UNDENIABLE
ROMANTIC IMPLICATIONS?

06:41.542 --> 06:43.667
NOT TO MENTION PACEY.
WHAT ABOUT PACEY?

06:43.667 --> 06:47.041
WHAT DID YOU THINK
ACCEPTING DAWSON'S
PROM INVITATION WOULD DO

06:47.041 --> 06:50.291
IF NOT PUT YOU RIGHT
IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS
TUG OF WAR WITH PACEY?

06:50.291 --> 06:52.375
[SIGHS]

06:52.375 --> 06:55.000
WELL, I--I KNOW.
I'M JUST--I'M TRYING.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.500
I'M TRYING SO HARD
JUST TO GET THINGS BACK
TO THE WAY THEY WERE.

06:58.500 --> 07:02.417
COME ON, JO.
YOU'RE NOT THAT NAIVE.

07:02.417 --> 07:04.875
I HAVE TO BE.
I'M BACKED UP
INTO A CORNER.

07:04.875 --> 07:06.625
I DON'T HAVE
ANY CHOICE.

07:06.625 --> 07:07.417
YOU ALWAYS
HAVE A CHOICE.

07:07.417 --> 07:11.792
WELL...
NO APPEALING CHOICE.

07:11.792 --> 07:13.333
SO YOU'RE
LOOKING TO ME

07:13.333 --> 07:15.625
TO PROVIDE
THE MAGICAL KEY
TO THIS PROBLEM?

07:15.625 --> 07:16.959
YEAH.

07:16.959 --> 07:18.875
[SIGHS]

07:18.875 --> 07:20.417
I GOTTA SAY,
YOU'VE BEEN A LITTLE THIN

07:20.417 --> 07:21.583
IN THE ADVICE
DEPARTMENT LATELY.

07:21.583 --> 07:25.792
GIVE ME A PROBLEM THAT
ACTUALLY HAS A SOLUTION,

07:25.792 --> 07:27.208
AND I'LL SOLVE IT.

07:29.542 --> 07:31.458
YOU'RE RIGHT.

07:31.458 --> 07:34.500
I MEAN,
NO MATTER WHAT I DO,
SOMEBODY GETS HURT.

07:34.500 --> 07:36.083
INCLUDING ME.

07:39.375 --> 07:41.500
I HATE THE STUPID PROM.

07:41.500 --> 07:44.959
STUPID PROM
CAN KISS MY ASS.

07:44.959 --> 07:46.834
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

07:46.834 --> 07:49.959
I THOUGHT THAT PACEY
WAS GONNA ASK ME
TO THE PROM,

07:49.959 --> 07:54.208
BUT NO, INSTEAD
I MUST HUMILIATE MYSELF
AND GO ALONE.

07:54.208 --> 07:55.291
BETTER YOU THAN GOING
WITH AN EX-BOYFRIEND

07:55.291 --> 07:57.583
THAT YOU'RE
NOT OVER YET.

07:57.583 --> 07:59.959
I AM SO  OVER HIM.

07:59.959 --> 08:02.041
I AM! THAT'S WHY
I WANT TO GO WITH HIM

08:02.041 --> 08:03.875
IS BECAUSE
IT'LL BE SAFE.

08:03.875 --> 08:04.583
MM-HMM.

08:08.875 --> 08:12.041
SO WHAT ABOUT YOU?
DID YOU GET YOUR TICKETS YET?

08:12.041 --> 08:12.959
NO. WORKING ON IT.

08:12.959 --> 08:15.583
SEE, THE THEME
THIS YEAR--COUPLES.

08:15.583 --> 08:17.625
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE
EVERY COUPLE'S NAMES

08:17.625 --> 08:18.667
ON THE BALLOONS,
THE LITTLE PLACE CARDS,

08:18.667 --> 08:21.667
ON THOSE CHEESY
PROM SOUVENIRS.

08:21.667 --> 08:23.708
SO?

08:23.708 --> 08:25.792
SO WHEN YOU GO
TO BUY YOUR TICKETS,

08:25.792 --> 08:26.917
YOU GOTTA SAY WHO
YOU'RE BRINGING,

08:26.917 --> 08:28.250
WHICH MEANS I HAVE
TO MARCH OVER THERE

08:28.250 --> 08:30.625
AND TELL THE WHOLE WORLD
I'M BRINGING A GUY.

08:30.625 --> 08:33.041
DON'T YOU THINK WHEN
YOU SHOW UP WITH ETHAN,

08:33.041 --> 08:34.833
THEY'RE GONNA FIGURE OUT
THAT HE'S YOUR DATE?

08:34.833 --> 08:37.917
HE'S NOT MY "DATE" DATE.
WE'RE GOING AS FRIENDS.

08:37.917 --> 08:41.500
HE CALLS IT THE NEXT STEP
TOWARDS SELF-ACCEPTANCE
AND ACTUALIZATION,

08:41.500 --> 08:44.000
WHATEVER THE HELL
THAT MEANS.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.667
I DON'T SEE WHAT YOU'RE
SO WORRIED ABOUT.

08:45.667 --> 08:47.333
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU TO CARE
WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK.

08:48.208 --> 08:50.125
YOU SEE WHO'S SELLING
THE TICKETS?

08:51.625 --> 08:52.625
BARBARA JOHNS?

08:55.708 --> 08:58.166
SO, YOU KNOW WHAT
THEY'RE HAVING THIS WEEKEND

08:58.166 --> 09:00.834
IS THE JUNIOR PROM.

09:00.834 --> 09:01.792
REALLY?

09:01.792 --> 09:03.708
YEAH. GOD, IS THERE
A MORE RIDICULOUS

09:03.708 --> 09:05.959
AND EMBARRASSING RITUAL
THAN THE PROM?

09:05.959 --> 09:09.041
THE WAY THAT IT TOTALLY
REINFORCES TRADITIONAL
GENDER ROLES,

09:09.041 --> 09:11.166
REWARDS THE COOL KIDS,
PUNISHES THE GEEKS,

09:11.166 --> 09:14.208
I MEAN, THE PRESSURE
THIS ONE SINGLE NIGHT

09:14.208 --> 09:16.000
EXERTS ON
THE COMMON TEENAGER...

09:16.000 --> 09:17.959
TO MAKE HOLLOW, AWKWARD
ROMANTIC GESTURES

09:17.959 --> 09:19.834
LIKE PINNING
A CHEAP CORSAGE
ON TAFFETA,

09:19.834 --> 09:22.458
HAVING DRUNKEN SEX
WITH SOME GUY WHOSE NAME
YOU WON'T REMEMBER,

09:22.458 --> 09:25.000
AND THEN PUKING
IN THE BACK OF SOME
CHEESY-ASS RENTED LIMO,

09:25.000 --> 09:27.208
I MEAN, IT'S JUST
SO OVERWHELMING.

09:27.208 --> 09:29.792
YOU'VE NEVER BEEN TO
A PROM BEFORE, HAVE YOU?

09:31.542 --> 09:34.542
WELL, NO. BUT I KNOW
ENOUGH ABOUT THEM
TO KNOW IT'S A SAD--

09:34.542 --> 09:36.834
SO, IN OTHER WORDS,
YOU'RE ASKING ME TO GO.

09:36.834 --> 09:38.750
[SIGHS]

09:39.125 --> 09:41.375
YEAH.

09:41.375 --> 09:42.917
I'D LOVE TO.

09:44.917 --> 09:45.875
OK.

09:47.333 --> 09:49.083
Barbara: THE THEME
OF THIS YEAR'S PROM
IS "COUPLES."

09:49.083 --> 09:51.875
PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME
AS WELL AS THE NAME
OF YOUR DATE.

09:51.875 --> 09:55.333
AHEM. YEAH.
IT'S, UM, JACK McPHEE...

09:55.333 --> 09:59.208
AND, UM, ETHAN BRODY.

09:59.208 --> 09:59.917
EXCUSE ME?

09:59.917 --> 10:02.083
ETHAN BRODY.
E-T-H-A-N.

10:02.083 --> 10:03.583
NO, NO, NO.

10:03.583 --> 10:04.917
A BOY CANNOT GO TO
THE PROM WITH A BOY.

10:04.917 --> 10:06.834
THE DEFINITION OF A PROM DATE
IS A BOY AND A GIRL.

10:06.834 --> 10:09.125
WELL, I DON'T THINK
THAT'S ANY OF
YOUR BUSINESS.

10:09.125 --> 10:12.417
TO BE HONEST,
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU FEEL THE NEED

10:12.417 --> 10:15.333
TO CAUSE A SPECTACLE
AND RUIN THE PROM
FOR THE REST OF US,

10:15.333 --> 10:16.417
BUT IF YOU FEEL
YOU HAVE TO DO SO,

10:16.417 --> 10:18.708
I CAN'T SELL YOU A TICKET

10:18.708 --> 10:21.083
TILL I TALK TO MRS. MEYER,
HEAD OF THE PROM COMMITTEE.

10:21.083 --> 10:22.750
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
SELL ME A TICKET?

10:22.750 --> 10:23.959
WHAT EXACTLY IS IT
THE TWO OF YOU
WILL DO, ANYWAY?

10:23.959 --> 10:27.625
TAKE A NICE PROM PHOTO
FOR GRANDMA'S PHOTO ALBUM?

10:27.625 --> 10:30.834
DANCE STUBBLED CHEEK
TO STUBBLED CHEEK?

10:30.834 --> 10:32.667
SHARE A ROMANTIC KISS
UNDER THE MOONLIGHT?

10:32.667 --> 10:34.792
YOU DON'T THINK
THAT'S GONNA WEIRD OUT

10:34.792 --> 10:35.417
EVEN THE ONES
WHO ARE SYMPATHETIC
TO PEOPLE LIKE YOU?

10:35.417 --> 10:36.875
YOU CAN'T DO THIS.

10:36.875 --> 10:38.708
LIKE I SAID, JACK,
I'LL CHECK WITH MRS. MEYER,

10:38.708 --> 10:41.667
AND YOU CAN COME BACK
AND TRY AGAIN.

10:41.667 --> 10:41.875
NEXT!

10:44.208 --> 10:45.583
WHAT'S UP, JACK?
YOU OK?

10:45.583 --> 10:48.625
YEAH, YEAH,
I'M FINE.

10:48.625 --> 10:50.083
I--I GOTTA GO.

10:52.667 --> 10:54.792
THE THEME OF THIS YEAR'S
PROM IS "COUPLES."

10:54.792 --> 10:57.917
PLEASE STATE
YOUR NAME AS WELL AS
THE NAME OF YOUR DATE.

10:57.917 --> 11:00.333
BARBARA,
YOU'RE IN MY GYM CLASS.
YOU KNOW MY NAME.

11:00.333 --> 11:02.959
PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME
AS WELL AS THE NAME
OF YOUR DATE.

11:02.959 --> 11:04.667
DAWSON LEERY
AND JOEY POTTER.

11:04.667 --> 11:07.625
OH? HAPPY COUPLE
BACK TOGETHER?

11:07.625 --> 11:10.542
SOMETHING LIKE THAT,
YEAH.

11:25.291 --> 11:27.542
THEY CAN'T DO THIS
TO YOU JACK.
WE WON'T LET THEM.

11:27.542 --> 11:30.875
YEAH. WE'LL--WE'LL LODGE
A FORMAL COMPLAINT.

11:30.875 --> 11:33.917
NOT ONLY WILL YOU GET
YOUR TICKETS FOR FREE,

11:33.917 --> 11:36.000
BUT WE WILL GET
BARBARA JOHNS
TO APOLOGIZE

11:36.000 --> 11:36.667
IN FRONT OF
THE WHOLE SCHOOL.

11:36.667 --> 11:38.750
ON HER HANDS
AND KNEES.

11:38.750 --> 11:40.083
GUYS...

11:40.083 --> 11:41.917
WE COULD GO TO MRS. MEYER
AND TELL HER WHAT BARBARA DID.

11:41.917 --> 11:45.583
SHE HAS TO
SELL THE TICKETS.
IT'S DISCRIMINATION.

11:45.583 --> 11:46.708
GUYS!

11:46.708 --> 11:49.708
I APPRECIATE
THE SUPPORT, I DO,

11:49.708 --> 11:51.708
BUT IT'S OK.
I'M JUST NOT GONNA
GO TO THE PROM.

11:51.708 --> 11:53.625
WHAT?
YOU HAVE TO GO!

11:53.625 --> 11:55.625
AT THIS POINT,
IT'S POLITICAL.

11:55.625 --> 11:58.625
THAT'S JUST IT. IT'S A PROM.
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE FUN.

11:58.625 --> 12:00.291
WHY DOES MY ENTIRE LIFE
HAVE TO BE A FIGHT?

12:00.291 --> 12:02.542
WHY IS SOMETHING THAT'S
NORMAL FOR SOMEONE ELSE

12:02.542 --> 12:03.917
HAVE TO BE
SO POLITICAL FOR ME?

12:03.917 --> 12:05.667
'CAUSE THAT'S JUST
THE WAY IT IS,

12:05.667 --> 12:08.125
AND UNTIL THINGS CHANGE,
YOU HAVE TO FIGHT.

12:08.125 --> 12:09.959
AND WE'LL BE
THERE WITH YOU.
ALL THE WAY.

12:11.792 --> 12:13.375
JUST WANTED TO
GO TO THE PROM.

12:13.375 --> 12:15.625
THAT'S ALL.

12:15.625 --> 12:16.208
WELL, IF YOU'RE NOT GOING,
I'M NOT GOING.

12:16.208 --> 12:18.625
ME, NEITHER.

12:18.625 --> 12:22.959
Andie: GOOD!
THEN WE'LL BOYCOTT,
AND WE'LL ORGANIZE.

12:22.959 --> 12:26.375
I'VE GOT A BETTER IDEA.
JACK, YOU'RE RIGHT.

12:26.375 --> 12:27.708
LET'S HOLD OUR OWN PROM.

12:27.708 --> 12:29.083
RIGHT?
AN ALTERNATIVE PROM.

12:29.083 --> 12:32.625
THINK ABOUT IT.
WHY ARE WE PAYING
80 BUCKS A POP

12:32.625 --> 12:34.834
TO SIT WHERE THEY
TELL US TO SIT,
EAT RUBBERY CHICKEN,

12:34.834 --> 12:35.792
AND LISTEN TO
A SPECIAL SELECTION

12:35.792 --> 12:38.250
OF BARBARA JOHNS'
FAVORITE TUNES

12:38.250 --> 12:40.333
WHEN WE CAN HOLD
THE ANTI-PROM?

12:40.333 --> 12:43.500
WHERE IT'S NOT
ABOUT WHO YOU BRING,
BUT WHO YOU ARE.

12:43.500 --> 12:44.750
I LIKE IT.

12:44.750 --> 12:47.166
YEAH, I THINK IT'S
A GREAT IDEA, DAWSON.

12:52.667 --> 12:53.542
YEAH.

12:53.542 --> 12:56.208
WHAT WOULD
AN ALTERNATIVE PROM BE

12:56.208 --> 12:58.000
WITHOUT A COUPLE
OF GAY GUYS?

13:03.917 --> 13:04.875
SHOULD YOU GUYS
CHOOSE TO TAKE ME UP
ON THIS PROPOSAL,

13:04.875 --> 13:06.959
I WORKED IT OUT
AND THE REVENUE

13:06.959 --> 13:09.458
FROM TICKET SALES
WILL OFFSET THE COST.

13:09.458 --> 13:12.625
I'M TELLING YOU,
WE CAN TOTALLY
MAKE THIS WORK.

13:12.625 --> 13:14.125
YOU'VE OBVIOUSLY GIVEN
THIS A LOT OF THOUGHT.

13:14.125 --> 13:16.500
I ONLY HAVE
ONE QUESTION--WHY?

13:17.750 --> 13:20.166
I DON'T KNOW.
BIG THINGS ARE
HAPPENING ALL AROUND.

13:20.166 --> 13:24.417
I'M JUST TRYING
TO FACILITATE
MY OWN BIG THING.

13:24.417 --> 13:25.959
IF THE ANSWER IS YES.

13:25.959 --> 13:28.708
SHOULD WE SAY YES
NOW OR CONTINUE
TO TORTURE HIM?

13:28.708 --> 13:29.750
[SIGHS]

13:29.750 --> 13:30.959
MOM, THANK YOU.

13:30.959 --> 13:32.291
YOU GUYS WILL NOT
REGRET THIS,
I PROMISE.

13:32.291 --> 13:34.125
BUT YOU DO REALIZE
THIS IS MY RESTAURANT,

13:34.125 --> 13:35.542
SO I WILL BE HERE.

13:35.542 --> 13:36.208
AND EVERY PROM
NEEDS A CHAPERONE.

13:36.208 --> 13:39.208
OK.

13:39.208 --> 13:41.458
GREAT.

13:41.458 --> 13:44.041
I'M GONNA GO HANG
SOME FLYERS.

13:45.917 --> 13:47.959
WELL, HE SEEMS TO
HAVE GOTTEN THROUGH

13:47.959 --> 13:49.834
YESTERDAY'S EVENTS
UNSCATHED.

13:49.834 --> 13:52.417
HE SAYS HE'S NUMB
AT THIS POINT.

13:52.417 --> 13:53.458
IS THAT A GOOD THING?

13:53.458 --> 13:54.917
I DON'T KNOW.

13:54.917 --> 13:57.333
BUT HE DID SEEM,
REMARKABLY ENOUGH,

13:57.333 --> 13:58.583
TOTALLY OK.

13:58.583 --> 14:01.000
WELL,
THAT'S A RELIEF.

14:02.291 --> 14:03.959
KIND OF GOT ME
TO THINKING, THOUGH.

14:03.959 --> 14:05.166
MMM!

14:05.166 --> 14:08.250
WHO PUT CAYENNE
PEPPER IN THIS
MARINARA SAUCE?

14:08.250 --> 14:10.166
GALE?
YEAH?

14:10.166 --> 14:13.667
I THOUGHT MAYBE WE
SHOULD DISCUSS WHAT
WE'RE DOING HERE?

14:13.667 --> 14:14.834
WHAT WE'RE DOING WHERE?

14:14.834 --> 14:17.166
THIS THING
YOU AND I ARE DOING.

14:17.166 --> 14:20.959
I THOUGHT MAYBE WE SHOULD
DISCUSS WHAT IT MEANS.

14:20.959 --> 14:22.083
CAN'T WE JUST ENJOY IT
AND SEE WHERE IT LEADS?

14:22.083 --> 14:23.792
WHY DO WE ALWAYS HAVE
TO ANALYZE EVERYTHING?

14:23.792 --> 14:26.041
HELLO!
I ASKED A QUESTION.

14:26.041 --> 14:28.333
WHO PUT CAYENNE PEPPER
IN THE MARINARA SAUCE?

14:28.333 --> 14:30.291
[SIGHS]

14:31.792 --> 14:33.500
CAN YOU BELIEVE
THIS, JACK?

14:33.500 --> 14:37.458
I KNOW. THIS THING
COULD ACTUALLY TURN OUT
TO BE A SUCCESS.

14:37.458 --> 14:39.834
Andie: IN A MANNER
OF SPEAKING. HI.

14:39.834 --> 14:43.500
JUST BECAUSE
THE DREGS OF SOCIETY
GO TO YOUR PROM

14:43.500 --> 14:45.041
DOES NOT MAKE IT
A SUCCESS.

14:45.041 --> 14:47.542
NOBODY THAT MATTERS
WOULD BE CAUGHT DEAD THERE.

14:47.542 --> 14:49.208
I CERTAINLY WOULDN'T
GO IF YOU PAID ME.

14:49.208 --> 14:51.166
GOOD THING,
'CAUSE WE DON'T
WANT YOUR KIND.

14:51.166 --> 14:54.333
AND WHAT KIND IS THAT,
THE GOOD CHRISTIAN KIND?

14:54.333 --> 14:55.250
[LAUGHS]

14:55.250 --> 14:58.333
THIS IS NOT ABOUT
RELIGION, BARBARA.

14:58.333 --> 14:59.667
I MEAN THE KIND
THAT HATES PEOPLE.

14:59.667 --> 15:03.834
THE INTOLERANT, JUDGMENTAL,
HYPOCRITICAL KIND.

15:03.834 --> 15:06.041
THE CLOSE-MINDED,
IMMATURE, BIGOTED KIND.

15:06.041 --> 15:07.208
WITH BAD
FASHION SENSE.

15:07.208 --> 15:08.208
REALLY BAD.

15:08.208 --> 15:10.625
LOOK, AT LEAST
I'M NOT GOING TO HELL.

15:11.917 --> 15:14.041
THAT'S IT? THAT'S
YOUR WHOLE COMEBACK?

15:14.041 --> 15:15.500
OOH!

15:15.500 --> 15:16.917
THE THREAT
OF ETERNAL DAMNATION IS
A PRETTY GOOD COMEBACK.

15:16.917 --> 15:19.834
WELL, THAT THREAT
IS NOT YOURS TO MAKE.

15:19.834 --> 15:21.417
YOU JUST DON'T
GET IT, DO YOU?

15:21.417 --> 15:23.375
YOU'RE TOTALLY
MISSING THE POINT.

15:23.375 --> 15:26.041
HUH. NEXT!

15:26.041 --> 15:29.083
AND TO THINK I WAS
GOING TO GIVE THIS

15:29.083 --> 15:30.125
TO THE GOODWILL.

15:32.333 --> 15:33.959
YOU'RE GONNA
LOOK GREAT, HENRY.

15:33.959 --> 15:36.083
I FEEL LIKE A BUSBOY.

15:36.083 --> 15:37.250
IT'S THE BURDEN
OF MEN, DEAR.

15:37.250 --> 15:39.000
WHILE OUT
ON THE TOWN,

15:39.000 --> 15:40.834
YOU MUST STAND
IN THE BACKGROUND

15:40.834 --> 15:42.417
AND LET
YOUR WOMAN SHINE.

15:42.417 --> 15:46.625
OH, I THINK THAT HENRY
SHINES JUST FINE
ON HIS OWN, GRAMS.

15:46.625 --> 15:47.917
HE CERTAINLY DOES.

15:47.917 --> 15:49.041
[TEAPOT WHISTLES]

15:49.041 --> 15:51.834
OOH, THERE'S MY TEA.

15:51.834 --> 15:53.834
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

15:56.875 --> 16:00.291
OK. I...I THINK
IT'S TIME

16:00.291 --> 16:02.208
THAT YOU AND I
HAD THE TALK.

16:02.208 --> 16:02.959
THE TALK?

16:02.959 --> 16:05.375
YEAH.
THE PROM SEX TALK.

16:05.375 --> 16:07.125
THE PROM SEX TALK?

16:07.125 --> 16:08.458
COME ON, HENRY.

16:08.458 --> 16:10.667
LIKE IT WASN'T GOING TO
COME UP SOONER OR LATER.

16:14.041 --> 16:16.875
NOT NECESSARILY.

16:16.875 --> 16:19.625
OH, OK. TELL ME THAT
YOU WEREN'T THINKING

16:19.625 --> 16:21.041
THAT YOU, ME,
AND THE PROM DIDN'T MEAN

16:21.041 --> 16:23.000
THE DISTINCT POSSIBILITY

16:23.000 --> 16:26.375
OF DRUNKEN, BACKSEAT,
RENTED LIMO NOOKIE?

16:26.375 --> 16:28.667
I--I DIDN'T
RENT A LIMO.

16:28.667 --> 16:29.792
OK, THAT'S NOT
THE POINT.

16:29.792 --> 16:32.166
THE PROM PUTS A LOT
OF PRESSURE ON KIDS

16:32.166 --> 16:33.875
TO DO IT JUST
FOR THE SAKE OF IT.

16:33.875 --> 16:35.417
THEN YOU END UP
DOING IT 15 MINUTES
BEFORE CURFEW,

16:35.417 --> 16:37.959
AND IT'S
COMPLETELY UNROMANTIC
AND WAY TOO FAST,

16:37.959 --> 16:42.166
AND IT--IT JUST
GENERALLY SUCKS.

16:42.166 --> 16:46.500
AND YOU CAN NEVER
TAKE THAT BACK OR
CHANGE IT, SO...

16:46.500 --> 16:50.083
SO I THOUGHT
THAT MAYBE WE COULD MAKE
THE DECISION RIGHT NOW

16:50.083 --> 16:52.208
NOT  TO DO IT.

16:52.208 --> 16:56.500
OH, UM,
I'M IN NO RACE.

16:56.500 --> 16:57.834
YOU KNOW THAT.

16:57.834 --> 16:59.583
OK.

17:01.166 --> 17:06.666
BUT WE...
WE ARE GONNA DO IT

17:06.666 --> 17:09.040
EVENTUALLY, RIGHT?

17:09.875 --> 17:13.165
[LAUGHS]

17:13.165 --> 17:14.500
COME HERE.

17:16.333 --> 17:19.416
TO WHAT DO I OWE
THE HONOR OF THIS VISIT?

17:19.416 --> 17:20.750
I'M JUST BORED,
I GUESS.

17:20.750 --> 17:21.834
[LAUGHS]

17:21.834 --> 17:24.625
YOU ALWAYS KNEW
HOW TO FLATTER A GIRL.

17:24.625 --> 17:26.125
I TRY.

17:27.541 --> 17:29.917
SO, UM, GUESS
YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING

17:29.917 --> 17:30.750
TO THAT WHOLE
ALTERNATIVE PROM THING.

17:30.750 --> 17:33.750
MM-HMM. OH, HO!

17:33.750 --> 17:34.875
YOU ARE NOT GONNA BELIEVE
WHAT I DID TODAY.

17:34.875 --> 17:37.542
I THREW MY TICKET BACK
IN BARBARA JOHNS' FACE.

17:37.542 --> 17:40.834
KNOW WHAT THAT WITCH SAID
TO ME WHEN I BOUGHT IT?

17:40.834 --> 17:43.125
"OH, THAT IS
SO BRAVE, ANDIE.

17:43.125 --> 17:45.708
A GIRL GOING
TO THE PROM ALONE."

17:45.708 --> 17:46.959
OOH!

17:46.959 --> 17:49.750
WHY WOULD YOU GO
TO THE PROM ALONE?

17:49.750 --> 17:50.542
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
SIFTING THROUGH OFFERS.

17:50.542 --> 17:54.041
YEAH.

17:54.041 --> 17:56.166
WELL, UH...

17:56.166 --> 17:58.834
TURNS OUT THAT
I DIDN'T HAVE ANY.

18:00.250 --> 18:02.458
SO WHY DIDN'T YOU
JUST TELL ME THAT?

18:03.417 --> 18:06.291
BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT
A PITY ASK, OK?

18:06.291 --> 18:07.417
AND IT DOESN'T
MATTER ANYWAY,

18:07.417 --> 18:09.583
BECAUSE ALL OF MY FRIENDS
ARE GONNA BE THERE,

18:09.583 --> 18:11.500
AND AT THIS POINT,
I'M JUST GOING TO SUPPORT

18:11.500 --> 18:13.667
THE WHOLE STUPID
ALTERNATIVE PROM THING.

18:13.667 --> 18:15.083
YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN
ABLE TO TELL ME.

18:15.083 --> 18:18.166
AND IT WOULDN'T BE
A PITY ASK,

18:18.166 --> 18:22.041
BECAUSE IT CAN'T BE PITY
IF IT'S AN HONOR.

18:23.250 --> 18:25.917
ANDREA McPHEE...

18:25.917 --> 18:28.667
WOULD YOU GO TO
THE PROM WITH ME?

18:31.583 --> 18:32.625
HI.

18:32.625 --> 18:34.583
HEY.

18:34.583 --> 18:35.667
SO...

18:35.667 --> 18:36.625
HEY.

18:36.625 --> 18:38.959
Dawson: WOW.

18:38.959 --> 18:41.583
YOU LOOK...

18:41.583 --> 18:44.417
IT'S JUST A DRESS,
DAWSON.

18:44.417 --> 18:46.000
Bessie:
OK, PICTURE TIME!

18:49.208 --> 18:50.333
[GIGGLES]

18:50.333 --> 18:51.500
[LAUGHS]

18:51.500 --> 18:54.375
WE SHOULD PROBABLY GO.
WE DON'T WANT TO BE LATE.

18:54.375 --> 18:57.291
Bessie: ALWAYS HATED
HAVING YOUR PICTURE TAKEN.

18:57.291 --> 18:59.125
WELL, SO, DAWSON,
WHERE'S THE CORSAGE?

18:59.125 --> 19:02.750
WE MADE A DEAL--
NO CORSAGES--

19:02.750 --> 19:04.542
BUT I HAD TO BRING
SOMETHING.

19:04.542 --> 19:07.834
SO I THOUGHT
I'D BRING THESE.

19:07.834 --> 19:09.667
DIAMOND EARRINGS?

19:09.667 --> 19:11.083
Bessie: WOW.

19:11.083 --> 19:12.959
DAWSON, I CAN'T
TAKE THESE.

19:12.959 --> 19:15.375
RELAX, THEY'RE MY MOM'S.

19:15.375 --> 19:18.208
THEY'RE ON LOAN, LIKE
AT THE ACADEMY AWARDS.

19:18.208 --> 19:19.917
I THOUGHT THEY WOULD
LOOK AMAZING ON YOU.

19:19.917 --> 19:23.333
I--I CAN'T WEAR THEM.
WHAT IF SOMETHING HAPPENS?

19:23.333 --> 19:26.917
IF SOMETHING HAPPENS
TO WHAT, YOUR EARLOBES?

19:26.917 --> 19:28.333
STOP IT. PUT 'EM ON.

19:30.667 --> 19:32.041
THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL.

19:32.041 --> 19:34.041
SO PUT THEM ON,
AND I'LL GET
ONE MORE PICTURE.

19:40.834 --> 19:44.625
Bessie: OHH.

19:44.625 --> 19:46.250
THANK YOU.

19:47.125 --> 19:50.208
1...2...3!

19:56.166 --> 19:56.834
Gale: HI. HI.

19:56.834 --> 19:57.834
Mitch: WELCOME.

19:57.834 --> 20:01.417
[SIGHS] OH, BOY.

20:01.417 --> 20:03.000
INTERESTING CROWD.

20:03.000 --> 20:03.667
LOCK THE CASH REGISTER.

20:03.667 --> 20:06.208
I'M ON IT.

20:10.542 --> 20:13.250
HEY, CAN YOU BELIEVE
WE WORE THE SAME THING?

20:13.250 --> 20:15.750
[LAUGHS]

20:15.750 --> 20:19.542
YEAH, WELL, I THOUGHT
IT WAS PRETTY FUNNY.

20:19.542 --> 20:21.875
[SIGHS]

20:21.875 --> 20:23.792
JACK, I'M NOT EXPECTING
YOU TO DANCE WITH ME,

20:23.792 --> 20:24.792
IF THAT'S WHAT
YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT.

20:24.792 --> 20:29.041
NO. NO, I'M NOT WORRIED
ABOUT ANYTHING.

20:29.041 --> 20:29.708
NAH.

20:29.708 --> 20:32.041
OK.

20:34.375 --> 20:36.041
HI, THERE.
HEY.

20:36.041 --> 20:37.625
HEY.

20:37.625 --> 20:39.375
HEY, JACK, ETHAN.

20:42.959 --> 20:44.500
HEY, YOU GUYS.

20:44.500 --> 20:46.500
JOEY, I LOVE
THOSE EARRINGS.

20:46.500 --> 20:48.458
THANK YOU.

20:51.500 --> 20:54.041
Andie: HEY, GUYS! WHAT'S GOING
ON?

20:59.125 --> 21:02.333
SHALL WE DANCE?

21:07.583 --> 21:08.166
Jen:
COME ON, SIT DOWN.

21:08.166 --> 21:10.333
GREAT.
[LAUGHS]

21:10.333 --> 21:13.834
WOW, JEN, YOUR DRESS
IS FABULOUS.

21:13.834 --> 21:16.083
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
YOU LOOK AWESOME.

21:16.083 --> 21:16.917
THANK YOU.
[LAUGHS] THANKS.

21:16.917 --> 21:17.875
HEY, ETHAN.

21:17.875 --> 21:20.083
Ethan: HI, ANDIE.

21:20.083 --> 21:20.583
HENRY.
HEY.

21:46.875 --> 21:49.458
SO, HERE WE ARE.

21:49.458 --> 21:49.959
YEP.

21:49.959 --> 21:53.291
AT THE PROM.

21:53.291 --> 21:53.500
YEP.

21:55.959 --> 21:58.500
SO, WHAT ARE YOU
THINKING?

21:58.500 --> 22:00.542
I WASN'T THINKING
ABOUT SEX, OK?

22:00.542 --> 22:05.000
HENRY, CHILL.
YOU'RE ALLOWED
TO THINK ABOUT SEX.

22:05.000 --> 22:08.625
WELL, I--I WASN'T.

22:08.625 --> 22:10.125
NO, I'M SURE.

22:10.125 --> 22:12.542
I'M JUST SAYING
IF YOU WERE,
IT'S FINE.

22:12.542 --> 22:14.625
YOU CAN THINK ABOUT SEX,
I CAN THINK ABOUT SEX,

22:14.625 --> 22:18.417
IT'S JUST THAT TONIGHT
THAT IT'S NOT A FACTOR.

22:18.417 --> 22:20.208
RIGHT?

22:25.667 --> 22:27.792
I'M GLAD, YOU KNOW.

22:27.792 --> 22:29.333
ABOUT WHAT?

22:29.333 --> 22:31.792
THAT YOU HAD THE COURAGE
TO BRING ME, JACK.

22:31.792 --> 22:34.166
I KNOW IT'S NOT EASY.
EVEN FOR ME.

22:34.166 --> 22:36.667
WHEN BRAD AND I
FIRST TOLD PEOPLE
WHAT WAS HAPPENING--

22:36.667 --> 22:38.208
CAN WE MAYBE PUT A PIN

22:38.208 --> 22:39.834
IN THE "WHEN I WAS
A YOUNG GAY BOY"
STORIES FOR TONIGHT?

22:39.834 --> 22:42.542
IT'S NOT PROVIDING ME
WITH A LOT OF SOLACE
RIGHT NOW.

22:44.708 --> 22:46.667
WHAT I WAS GONNA SAY,
JACK,

22:46.667 --> 22:49.625
IS THAT BRAD AND I
NEVER DID ANYTHING
TOGETHER.

22:49.625 --> 22:50.875
IN FACT,
FOR ALL MY BRAVADO,

22:50.875 --> 22:53.750
I'VE NEVER ASKED A GUY
TO ANYTHING LIKE THIS.

22:53.750 --> 22:56.333
WHA...

22:56.333 --> 22:59.250
YOU MEAN ALL THAT CRAP
ABOUT ACTUALIZATION,

22:59.250 --> 23:01.166
YOU'VE NEVER ACTUALIZED?

23:01.166 --> 23:03.208
I GUESS I THOUGHT
IT WAS A HURDLE

23:03.208 --> 23:04.708
WE COULD JUMP OVER
TOGETHER.

23:04.708 --> 23:06.208
AT MY HIGH-SCHOOL PROM
WHERE YOU KNOW NO ONE,

23:06.208 --> 23:09.208
AND I KNOW EVERYONE?

23:09.208 --> 23:10.208
TELL ME, HOW "TOGETHER"
IS THAT, ETHAN?

23:10.208 --> 23:11.708
SO YOU WIN IN
THE COURAGE DEPARTMENT.

23:11.708 --> 23:14.041
NO, I DON'T, BECAUSE
I WAS TRICKED INTO IT.

23:14.041 --> 23:16.041
COURAGE WOULD HAVE BEEN
TELLING YOU THAT
I'M NOT READY FOR THIS,

23:16.041 --> 23:17.667
THAT HOWEVER HEALTHY
THIS MIGHT BE FOR
MY SEXUAL IDENTITY,

23:17.667 --> 23:20.542
I REALLY DON'T WANT
TO BE HERE RIGHT NOW.

23:20.542 --> 23:21.792
WELL, I'M SORRY.

23:21.792 --> 23:22.708
SO AM I.

23:22.708 --> 23:24.375
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

23:24.375 --> 23:25.542
I'M GOING
TO GET A SODA.

23:25.542 --> 23:29.125
I WAS WONDERING,
WISE GAY SAGE
THAT YOU ARE,

23:29.125 --> 23:33.375
COKE, DIET PEPSI--
WHAT'S BETTER FOR
MY SELF-ACTUALIZATION?

23:38.208 --> 23:41.250
YOU KNOW,
THERE ARE OTHER THINGS
THAT WE CAN TALK ABOUT.

23:41.250 --> 23:43.583
BESIDES SEX.

23:43.583 --> 23:45.208
OF COURSE.

23:45.208 --> 23:46.625
WE--WE COULD
TALK ABOUT...

23:49.542 --> 23:51.583
SUMMER.
WE COULD TALK ABOUT

23:51.583 --> 23:53.583
WHAT WE'RE GONNA
DO THIS SUMMER.

23:53.583 --> 23:55.000
I THOUGHT WE COULD TAKE
A COUPLE OF DAY TRIPS

23:55.000 --> 23:56.208
UP TO NANTUCKET,

23:56.208 --> 23:57.834
GO SEE SOME CONCERTS
UP IN BOSTON--

23:57.834 --> 24:00.792
SURE. WHEN I GET BACK
FROM FOOTBALL CAMP.

24:00.792 --> 24:02.583
WHAT-BALL CAMP?

24:02.583 --> 24:05.000
FOOTBALL CAMP.
IN CLEVELAND.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.834
8 WEEKS. I LEAVE
AT THE END OF JUNE.

24:09.125 --> 24:10.667
YOU'RE LEAVING ME
FOR THE WHOLE SUMMER

24:10.667 --> 24:12.583
TO GO TO FOOTBALL CAMP,
AND YOU TELL ME THIS NOW?

24:12.583 --> 24:16.333
WELL...WHAT'S WRONG
WITH NOW?

24:16.333 --> 24:17.542
YOU DON'T DEVASTATE
YOUR GIRLFRIEND

24:17.542 --> 24:19.792
WITH THE NEWS
OF AN IMPENDING
2-MONTH SEPARATION

24:19.792 --> 24:21.291
IN THE MIDDLE OF PROM.
THAT RUINS THE NIGHT.

24:21.291 --> 24:23.667
I'VE RUINED THE NIGHT?

24:23.667 --> 24:26.166
AND AS FOR LATER GOES,
WHATEVER SLIM
POSSIBILITY

24:26.166 --> 24:28.250
MAY HAVE EXISTED
THAT YOU AND I MIGHT
ACTUALLY HAVE SEX,

24:28.250 --> 24:29.625
YOU CAN JUST FORGET
ABOUT THAT NOW.

24:29.625 --> 24:32.291
WE ALREADY ESTABLISHED
WE WEREN'T GONNA HAVE
SEX TONIGHT.

24:32.291 --> 24:33.834
COME ON, HENRY.
THAT'S JUST WHAT YOU SAY

24:33.834 --> 24:36.750
TO ALLEVIATE
THE PRESSURE AND MAKE
IT SEEM SPONTANEOUS.

24:36.750 --> 24:38.041
OF COURSE,
THERE WAS A CHANCE.
IT'S OUR PROM!

24:38.041 --> 24:40.917
WH-WH--

24:42.959 --> 24:44.125
DAMN.

24:52.708 --> 24:55.750
COULD I ASK A BRAZEN
BUT OBVIOUS QUESTION?

24:55.750 --> 24:59.583
YEAH, OF COURSE.

24:59.583 --> 25:01.166
WHY DID YOU
BRING ME HERE
TONIGHT, DAWSON?

25:01.166 --> 25:02.375
WHAT?

25:02.375 --> 25:06.000
WAS IT JUST SO YOU
COULD THROW JABS
AT PACEY?

25:06.000 --> 25:07.041
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

25:07.041 --> 25:09.417
I HAD NO IDEA PACEY
WOULD BE HERE.

25:09.417 --> 25:10.500
YOU DON'T THINK
I GET THE SUBTEXT

25:10.500 --> 25:11.500
OF EVERY ONE
OF THOSE LOOKS

25:11.500 --> 25:12.708
YOU KEEP THROWING
HIS WAY?

25:12.708 --> 25:15.166
I MEAN, DAWSON,
YOU MIGHT AS WELL
GET ON THE P.A.

25:15.166 --> 25:18.959
AND SCREAM,
"SHE'S MINE, PACEY.
HA. I WIN."

25:18.959 --> 25:20.333
ACTUALLY, THAT'S NOT
WHAT I'M THINKING.

25:20.333 --> 25:22.875
THEN WHAT ARE
YOU THINKING?

25:22.875 --> 25:24.542
I'M THINKING,
WHAT RIGHT
DID HE HAVE

25:24.542 --> 25:26.083
TO SHOW UP
TO MY MOTHER'S
RESTAURANT

25:26.083 --> 25:27.208
AT A PROM THAT
I ORGANIZED.

25:27.208 --> 25:29.208
WHAT EXACTLY
IS HE TRYING
TO ACCOMPLISH?

25:29.208 --> 25:30.708
NOW, GIVEN
THE CIRCUMSTANCES

25:30.708 --> 25:32.000
UNDER WHICH
THIS NIGHT ORIGINATED,

25:32.000 --> 25:33.375
WHAT RIGHT DO YOU HAVE
TO EXCLUDE ANYONE?

25:33.375 --> 25:34.333
I'M NOT
EXCLUDING HIM, JO.

25:34.333 --> 25:35.417
I HAVEN'T SAID
A WORD TO HIM.

25:35.417 --> 25:37.500
FINE, BUT THAT
HASN'T STOPPED YOU

25:37.500 --> 25:38.834
FROM PARADING ME
AROUND ALL NIGHT

25:38.834 --> 25:40.291
LIKE I'M SOME SORT
OF A PRIZE.

25:40.291 --> 25:42.583
PARADING YOU?
I'M NOT PARADING YOU
AROUND, JOEY.

25:42.583 --> 25:44.083
YOU'RE MY DATE,
AND I'M DANCING WITH YOU.

25:44.083 --> 25:46.375
IT'S NOT MY FAULT
IF THEY KEEP
STARING AT US.

25:46.375 --> 25:49.875
YOU'RE RIGHT.
NONE OF IT'S
YOUR FAULT.

25:49.875 --> 25:50.959
NONE OF IT'S
ANYBODY'S FAULT.

25:50.959 --> 25:52.417
IT'S JUST
HAPPENING.

25:52.417 --> 25:54.875
AND WHO CARES
WHAT IT'S DOING
TO ME?

25:54.875 --> 25:57.834
OK.

26:00.333 --> 26:03.667
YOU KNOW, LET'S JUST
START OVER, OK?

26:03.667 --> 26:06.792
IT'S JUST DAWSON
AND JOEY AT THE PROM

26:06.792 --> 26:11.834
HAVING A GOOD TIME.
OK?

26:16.208 --> 26:17.750
I NEED A BREATHER.

26:37.667 --> 26:39.458
CARE TO MAKE
A RUN FOR IT?

26:39.458 --> 26:41.458
YES, PLEASE.

26:41.458 --> 26:42.667
OHH.

26:46.625 --> 26:49.333
SO, WHAT ARE YOU
HIDING FROM?

26:49.333 --> 26:51.792
I AM HIDING
FROM BARBARA JOHNS.

26:51.792 --> 26:53.291
SHE'S HERE?

26:53.291 --> 26:56.417
NO. YEAH,
IN A WAY, SHE IS.

26:59.041 --> 27:02.083
OH, MAN.
SHE WAS RIGHT, JOEY.

27:02.083 --> 27:03.708
YOU KNOW,
I DON'T BELONG HERE.

27:03.708 --> 27:05.208
I'M NOT GONNA DANCE
WITH ETHAN.

27:05.208 --> 27:07.291
I'M NOT GONNA
HAVE MY PICTURE
TAKEN WITH HIM.

27:07.291 --> 27:09.792
AND WHATEVER
GOOD TIME I WAS
GONNA HAVE TONIGHT,

27:09.792 --> 27:12.166
I JUST RUINED IT
BY THE WAY
I TREATED HIM.

27:14.291 --> 27:17.291
YOU REALLY LIKE HIM,
DON'T YOU?

27:17.291 --> 27:18.959
I REMEMBER
A CONVERSATION

27:18.959 --> 27:21.041
LESS THAN
A YEAR AGO,

27:21.041 --> 27:23.458
UNDER THESE
VERY STARS,

27:23.458 --> 27:25.458
AND ALL
YOU COULD SEE

27:25.458 --> 27:27.917
WAS THE PAIN
AND THE LONELINESS

27:27.917 --> 27:31.250
THAT MADE YOUR LIFE
DIFFERENT FROM
EVERYONE ELSE'S.

27:31.250 --> 27:34.333
AS OPPOSED TO NOW,
WHEN ALL I CAN SEE

27:34.333 --> 27:35.166
IS THE PAIN
AND LONELINESS

27:35.166 --> 27:36.750
THAT MAKES
OUR LIVES THE SAME?

27:42.375 --> 27:43.917
LOOK. I KNOW HOW SAD
IT IS TO HIDE

27:43.917 --> 27:45.875
FROM SOMETHING
THAT YOU REALLY WANT, JOEY.

27:45.875 --> 27:47.125
I JUST WANT
EVERYTHING
TO GO BACK

27:47.125 --> 27:48.500
TO THE WAY
IT WAS, YOU KNOW?

27:48.500 --> 27:49.917
ALL OF US
FRIENDS AGAIN,

27:49.917 --> 27:53.000
AND--AND ME
NOT CAUGHT
IN THE MIDDLE.

27:53.000 --> 27:56.000
WELL, IF YOU WANT THINGS
TO GET BACK TO THE WAY
THAT THEY WERE,

27:56.000 --> 27:59.166
YOU HAVE TO SET
THE EXAMPLE.

27:59.166 --> 28:00.500
DAWSON AND PACEY,
THOSE TWO

28:00.500 --> 28:02.750
JUST AREN'T GONNA DO IT
THEMSELVES RIGHT NOW.

28:05.333 --> 28:07.708
HOW ABOUT
WE HIDE OUT HERE
FOR A WHILE FIRST?

28:07.708 --> 28:11.875
IT SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.

28:16.083 --> 28:17.166
THANK YOU.

28:17.166 --> 28:18.583
THANK YOU.

28:18.583 --> 28:19.708
YOU KNOW, THIS MIGHT
BE A TAD PRESUMPTUOUS,

28:19.708 --> 28:22.667
BUT I TOOK THE LIBERTY
OF PACKING A BAG.

28:22.667 --> 28:24.834
I THOUGHT MAYBE
I COULD STAY OVER.

28:24.834 --> 28:28.708
I'M NOT SURE
THAT'S SUCH
A GOOD IDEA, GALE.

28:28.708 --> 28:31.083
MITCHELL,
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

28:31.083 --> 28:34.208
I'M NOT HERE JUST
FOR YOUR WHIM, GALE.

28:34.208 --> 28:36.000
[LAUGHS]
EXCUSE ME?

28:36.000 --> 28:37.291
GO AHEAD AND LAUGH,
BUT YOU KNOW,

28:37.291 --> 28:38.333
WE'VE FINALLY
GOTTEN BACK

28:38.333 --> 28:39.208
TO THIS POINT
IN OUR RELATIONSHIP

28:39.208 --> 28:40.875
BY BEING HONEST
WITH EACH OTHER.

28:40.875 --> 28:44.542
I'M NOT GONNA STOP
THAT HONESTY NOW.

28:44.542 --> 28:49.250
OK. SO IF
THE HONEST THING
IS TO TALK ABOUT IT,

28:49.250 --> 28:50.708
LET'S TALK
ABOUT IT.

28:50.708 --> 28:52.959
I CAN'T KEEP
PLAYING THIS GAME.

28:52.959 --> 28:56.500
IS IT A SLIP-UP?
IS IT A RELATIONSHIP?

28:56.500 --> 28:59.000
IS IT A SATURDAY-NIGHT
ARRANGEMENT? WHAT IS IT?

28:59.000 --> 29:00.166
WHAT DO YOU
WANT IT TO BE?

29:00.166 --> 29:01.333
NAH.

29:01.333 --> 29:02.875
YOU KNOW WHAT, GALE?
I'M SICK OF
BEING THE ONE

29:02.875 --> 29:05.667
ALWAYS
ANXIOUS TO DEFINE
OUR RELATIONSHIP

29:05.667 --> 29:07.834
OR LACK THEREOF.

29:07.834 --> 29:08.875
WHAT I WANT IS
FOR YOU TO DEFINE
IT FOR ONCE.

29:20.500 --> 29:23.208
I'VE BEEN MEANING
TO ASK YOU SOMETHING
ALL NIGHT, PACEY.

29:26.792 --> 29:28.041
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO DANCE WITH ME?

29:32.250 --> 29:33.041
YES.

29:47.083 --> 29:50.917
HOW COME THIS FEELS
SO RIGHT?

29:50.917 --> 29:52.959
I THINK IT WAS
THOSE DANCE LESSONS.

30:04.542 --> 30:06.375
WHERE DID YOU GET THOSE?

30:06.375 --> 30:09.000
THEY'RE NOT YOU.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.708
WHY, BECAUSE
I'M JUST
A POOR TOMBOY,

30:11.708 --> 30:16.500
OR 'CAUSE DAWSON
GAVE THEM TO ME?

30:18.583 --> 30:20.125
NEITHER.

30:20.125 --> 30:23.792
YOU SEE THIS?

30:23.792 --> 30:25.792
THIS IS YOU.

30:25.792 --> 30:30.458
IT'S NOT SHOWY
OR GAUDY.

30:30.458 --> 30:34.250
JUST SIMPLE.

30:34.250 --> 30:36.333
ELEGANT.

30:36.333 --> 30:40.333
BEAUTIFUL.

30:40.333 --> 30:42.875
IT'S MY MOM'S BRACELET.

30:45.375 --> 30:46.583
I KNOW.

30:49.375 --> 30:51.750
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

30:51.750 --> 30:54.917
WELL, BECAUSE
YOU TOLD ME.

30:54.917 --> 30:56.000
6 MONTHS AGO.

30:56.000 --> 30:59.917
YOU WERE WEARING
THAT, UH,
BLUE SWEATER

30:59.917 --> 31:02.792
WITH THE SNOWFLAKES
THAT YOU HAVE.

31:02.792 --> 31:03.834
WE WERE WALKING DOWN
THE HALLWAYS AT SCHOOL.

31:03.834 --> 31:08.166
I WAS ANNOYING YOU
AS PER USUAL.

31:08.166 --> 31:09.625
YOU SAID, "LOOK, PACEY.

31:09.625 --> 31:11.500
"I JUST FOUND
MY MOTHER'S BRACELET
THIS MORNING,

31:11.500 --> 31:14.291
SO WHY DON'T YOU
CUT ME SOME SLACK?"

31:16.583 --> 31:19.875
YOU REMEMBER THAT?

31:21.834 --> 31:24.917
I REMEMBER
EVERYTHING.

32:06.291 --> 32:07.583
DAWSON.

32:07.583 --> 32:10.291
DAWSON, WAIT.

32:10.291 --> 32:12.917
DAWSON, WAIT.

32:12.917 --> 32:13.750
HOW COULD YOU
DO THAT TO ME?

32:13.750 --> 32:14.834
ARE YOU TRYING
TO HURT ME?

32:14.834 --> 32:16.959
NO! I'M TRYING
TO SET AN EXAMPLE.

32:16.959 --> 32:18.959
I'M TRYING TO GET
THINGS BACK

32:18.959 --> 32:20.083
TO THE WAY
THEY WERE.

32:20.083 --> 32:21.667
YOU CAN'T GO BACK
TO THE WAY THEY WERE, JOEY.

32:21.667 --> 32:22.834
DON'T YOU GET IT?

32:22.834 --> 32:24.542
YOU CAN'T CLIMB
THROUGH MY WINDOW,

32:24.542 --> 32:26.417
POP IN E.T.,  AND HAVE IT
BE THE SAME, OK?

32:26.417 --> 32:27.834
YOU CAN'T DANCE
WITH HIM

32:27.834 --> 32:28.792
AT THE PROM
I ORGANIZED

32:28.792 --> 32:30.417
AND EXPECT ME
NOT TO BE HURT.

32:30.417 --> 32:32.875
YOU SAID TONIGHT
WAS ABOUT YOU, ME,
AND OUR FRIENDSHIP.

32:32.875 --> 32:34.375
AND IF THAT WAS
REALLY THE CASE,

32:34.375 --> 32:35.583
IT WOULDN'T MATTER
WHO I DANCED WITH.

32:35.583 --> 32:36.583
I SAID TONIGHT
WAS ABOUT MOVING
FORWARD, JOEY.

32:36.583 --> 32:38.083
WHAT DID YOU THINK
THAT MEANT?

32:38.083 --> 32:42.500
YOU CAN'T HAVE THOUGHT
THAT THAT'S ALL I WANTED.

32:42.500 --> 32:43.542
THE WHOLE REASON
I SUGGESTED

32:43.542 --> 32:45.500
THIS WHOLE STUPID
ALTERNATIVE PROM

32:45.500 --> 32:47.625
WASN'T ABOUT JACK,
IT WAS ABOUT YOU,
ALL RIGHT?

32:47.625 --> 32:49.125
AND MAYBE
I TRIED TOO HARD,

32:49.125 --> 32:50.750
BUT I DIDN'T WANT
TO MISS MY CHANCE
TO DANCE WITH YOU,

32:50.750 --> 32:53.500
TO HOLD YOU, TO MAKE YOU
REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS LIKE
BETWEEN US.

32:53.500 --> 32:58.458
I THOUGHT MAYBE, YOU KNOW,
IF I COULD MAKE IT PERFECT...

33:00.834 --> 33:02.750
THAT I WOULD
PICK YOU?

33:02.750 --> 33:05.417
SAY IT, DAWSON.

33:05.417 --> 33:07.500
YOU THOUGHT
IF YOU ORCHESTRATED
THIS WHOLE EVENING,

33:07.500 --> 33:08.750
THAT I WOULD
BE CONVINCED

33:08.750 --> 33:10.208
INTO PICKING YOU
OVER PACEY, RIGHT?

33:10.208 --> 33:13.792
YOU HAVE TO PICK
SOMEBODY, JOEY.

33:13.792 --> 33:14.959
I JUST WANTED
TO REMIND YOU

33:14.959 --> 33:16.542
WHAT YOU'D BE MISSING
IF YOU DIDN'T PICK ME.

33:18.959 --> 33:22.166
'CAUSE YOU'D BE
MISSING A LOT.

33:22.166 --> 33:25.000
SO WOULD I.
WE'D BE MISSING EVERYTHING.

33:46.667 --> 33:50.917
THAT'S HOW THE EVENING
WAS SUPPOSED TO END.

33:59.250 --> 34:02.250
I THINK I CAN TAKE IT
FROM HERE, THANKS.

34:02.250 --> 34:05.708
WOW, I THINK THOSE
WERE THE MOST WORDS
YOU'VE SAID TO ME

34:05.708 --> 34:07.208
SINCE I TOLD YOU
ABOUT FOOTBALL CAMP.

34:07.208 --> 34:08.917
HENRY, I'M NOT
IN THE MOOD.

34:08.917 --> 34:12.583
FINE. THEN,
LET'S TALK ABOUT
SOMETHING ELSE,

34:12.583 --> 34:14.417
LIKE WHY WOULD YOU
MAKE SUCH A BIG DEAL

34:14.417 --> 34:16.875
ABOUT THERE BEING
NO POSSIBILITY
OF US HAVING SEX

34:16.875 --> 34:18.625
IF YOU WERE PLANNING
TO DO IT ALL ALONG?

34:18.625 --> 34:20.542
I WASN'T PLANNING
ON ANYTHING.

34:20.542 --> 34:24.875
I MEAN, I THOUGHT THAT--
THAT MAYBE IF IT HAPPENED,
IF IT FELT RIGHT AND--

34:24.875 --> 34:27.583
AND NATURAL, THEN YEAH,
MAYBE WE WOULD, BUT YOU KNOW,
IT DOESN'T EVEN MATTER.

34:27.583 --> 34:29.708
BECAUSE OF
FOOTBALL CAMP?

34:29.708 --> 34:31.208
YOU KNOW, I HATE IT
WHEN YOU DO THIS.

34:31.208 --> 34:33.458
YOU GET EXTREME
ABOUT THE FUTURE
OF OUR RELATIONSHIP

34:33.458 --> 34:35.708
AT THE FIRST SIGN
OF ONE OF YOUR
INSECURITIES.

34:35.708 --> 34:37.708
THIS ISN'T ABOUT
MY INSECURITIES, HENRY.

34:37.708 --> 34:38.708
IT'S ABOUT
YOUR COWARDICE,

34:38.708 --> 34:40.667
WHAT?
AND THE FACT
THAT I PLANNED

34:40.667 --> 34:41.500
OUR ENTIRE
SUMMER TOGETHER,

34:41.500 --> 34:42.375
AND YOU WEREN'T
EVEN THINKING

34:42.375 --> 34:43.917
ABOUT SPENDING
ANY TIME WITH ME.

34:43.917 --> 34:49.875
FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN MY LIFE, I MADE MYSELF
VULNERABLE TO SOMEBODY...

34:49.875 --> 34:51.333
AND NOW I JUST FEEL STUPID.

34:51.333 --> 34:55.166
JEN, MY DECISION
TO GO, IT'S--

34:55.166 --> 34:55.750
IT'S GOT NOTHING
TO DO WITH YOU.

34:55.750 --> 34:57.583
EXACTLY.

34:57.583 --> 34:59.458
BUT IF THIS WERE
A REAL RELATIONSHIP,

34:59.458 --> 35:00.750
YOUR CHOICE
FOR THOSE 8 WEEKS,

35:00.750 --> 35:02.875
IT WOULD HAVE HAD
AT LEAST SOMETHING
TO DO WITH ME.

35:05.083 --> 35:07.083
GOOD NIGHT, HENRY.

35:07.083 --> 35:09.917
JEN, I WON'T GO
THROUGH THIS AGAIN.
I CAN'T.

35:09.917 --> 35:11.208
THIS TIME,
THERE WON'T BE
ANY POSTERS

35:11.208 --> 35:13.208
OR GRAND
DECLARATIONS
OF MY FEELINGS

35:13.208 --> 35:16.750
TOWARDS YOU.
YOU WALK
IN THAT HOUSE,

35:16.750 --> 35:18.834
AND IT'S NOT JUST
GOOD NIGHT...

35:18.834 --> 35:21.250
IT'S GOOD-BYE.

35:24.750 --> 35:26.250
GOOD-BYE.

35:29.750 --> 35:31.792
ETHAN, WAIT!

35:31.792 --> 35:33.000
WAIT.

35:34.208 --> 35:35.708
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
ARE YOU LEAVING?

35:35.708 --> 35:37.166
ARE YOU
KIDDING ME?

35:38.417 --> 35:41.875
LOOK, I-I'M SORRY
FOR THE WAY THAT
I ACTED TONIGHT.

35:41.875 --> 35:42.792
NO, JACK, I'M  SORRY.

35:42.792 --> 35:45.041
YOU CLEARLY WEREN'T
READY FOR THIS.

35:46.875 --> 35:51.291
THAT'S JUST IT,
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THIS  IS,

35:51.291 --> 35:53.333
SO MAYBE WE SHOULD
DEFINE THIS  BEFORE
WE DECIDE WHO'S READY.

36:00.542 --> 36:01.667
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

36:03.208 --> 36:04.333
I-I'M SAYING...

36:07.792 --> 36:11.333
OK, I'M SAYING
THAT TONIGHT...

36:11.333 --> 36:12.750
I DON'T THINK THAT
I WAS UNCOMFORTABLE

36:12.750 --> 36:14.166
WITH BRINGING
A GUY TO THE PROM.

36:15.333 --> 36:17.166
I THINK I WAS
UNCOMFORTABLE
WITH TAKING SOMEONE

36:17.166 --> 36:19.834
THAT DOESN'T FEEL
THE SAME WAY ABOUT ME
AS I FEEL ABOUT HIM.

36:19.834 --> 36:23.125
JACK,
I REALLY  LIKE YOU.

36:23.125 --> 36:25.583
THEN WHY
ALL THE HURDLES?

36:25.583 --> 36:27.417
WHY THIS WHOLE JOURNEY
FOR US TO BE TOGETHER

36:27.417 --> 36:30.500
WHEN ALL YOU HAD TO DO
WAS JUST LEAN OVER AND--

36:30.500 --> 36:32.000
KISS YOU.

36:33.291 --> 36:35.000
YEAH,
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

36:35.000 --> 36:37.375
BECAUSE, JACK,
I DON'T WANNA
KISS SOMEONE

36:37.375 --> 36:39.834
WHO ISN'T READY.
AND I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU'RE READY,

36:39.834 --> 36:41.166
SO I'M AFRAID--

36:41.166 --> 36:44.041
YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO KISS
ME FIRST.

36:44.041 --> 36:46.000
HOW DO YOU KNOW
THAT I COULDN'T?

36:46.000 --> 36:49.291
I DON'T KNOW.
I'M GUESSING.

36:49.291 --> 36:53.083
THEN MAYBE
YOU'RE GUESSING WRONG.
MAYBE I AM READY.

36:53.083 --> 36:56.917
OK, SO HERE
WE ARE--A LONE
TRAIN STATION,

36:56.917 --> 37:01.333
NO ONE AROUND,
NO LIGHTS,
NO CAMERAS,

37:01.333 --> 37:03.250
NO NETWORK
TELEVISION

37:03.250 --> 37:05.166
TO CUT
TO COMMERCIAL.

37:05.166 --> 37:06.875
IT'S JUST
YOU AND ME.

37:08.417 --> 37:11.208
SO KISS ME, JACK.

37:11.208 --> 37:12.625
I DARE YOU.

37:31.375 --> 37:34.083
I HONESTLY BELIEVED

37:34.083 --> 37:36.834
THAT WHEN I CAME OVER
TO INVITE YOU TO THE PROM,

37:36.834 --> 37:40.375
IT WAS BECAUSE I WANTED
TO GO TO THE PROM WITH YOU,

37:40.375 --> 37:45.000
AND I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MUCH
I WISH THAT WERE THE TRUTH,

37:45.000 --> 37:49.458
BUT AS SOON AS I GOT THERE,

37:49.458 --> 37:52.500
I REALIZED THAT I WANTED
TO GO TO THE PROM BECAUSE--

37:52.500 --> 37:56.959
I KNOW WHY YOU
WANTED TO GO TO
THE PROM, PACEY,

37:56.959 --> 37:59.625
AND I'M SORRY
THAT IT DIDN'T
WORK OUT FOR YOU.

38:01.250 --> 38:04.250
BUT AT LEAST YOU GOT
TO DANCE WITH HER.

38:04.250 --> 38:06.250
WHAT CAN I DO?

38:06.250 --> 38:08.166
REALLY, I WOULD DO
WHATEVER IT TAKES

38:08.166 --> 38:10.500
TO MAKE THIS
UP TO YOU, ANDIE.

38:11.417 --> 38:13.583
WHAT IT WOULD TAKE
IS SOMETHING THAT

38:13.583 --> 38:15.417
I DON'T THINK YOU CAN
GIVE ME RIGHT NOW,

38:15.417 --> 38:17.917
AND I'M NOT MAD
AT YOU, PACEY--

38:17.917 --> 38:19.959
HONESTLY, I'M NOT.
I JUST--

38:19.959 --> 38:23.083
I JUST REALLY
FEEL BAD FOR YOU.

38:34.667 --> 38:39.208
DID I TELL YOU
WHAT I'M GONNA BE
DOING THIS SUMMER?

38:39.208 --> 38:41.458
I'M GONNA SAIL TRUE LOVE
DOWN TO KEY WEST.

38:44.917 --> 38:46.333
JUST ME AND THE SEA.

38:46.333 --> 38:50.291
HOW'S THAT
FOR HEMINGWAYESQUE, HUH?

38:52.500 --> 38:55.875
SO WHEN ARE YOU
GONNA LEAVE?

38:55.875 --> 38:57.583
RIGHT AFTER FINALS.

39:00.875 --> 39:04.583
HAVE YOU TOLD HER
HOW YOU FEEL?

39:04.583 --> 39:07.625
ANDIE, SHE ALREADY
KNOWS HOW I FEEL.

39:11.333 --> 39:12.667
I MEAN,
HAVE YOU REALLY
TOLD HER, PACEY?

39:16.500 --> 39:19.333
YOU CAN'T JUST
LEAVE WITHOUT
LETTING HER KNOW.

39:19.333 --> 39:21.417
I MEAN, THAT'S
NOT LIKE YOU.

39:21.417 --> 39:24.125
YOU--YOU DON'T
JUST STAND AND
LET THINGS HAPPEN,

39:24.125 --> 39:25.792
AND YOU DON'T
RUN AWAY, EITHER.

39:25.792 --> 39:29.417
YOU HAVE TO TELL HER
THAT YOU LOVE HER,

39:29.417 --> 39:33.208
AND YOU HAVE TO TRY
TO GET HER BACK,

39:33.208 --> 39:34.583
BECAUSE IF
YOU DON'T,

39:34.583 --> 39:37.500
I PROMISE YOU,
YOU WILL REGRET IT.

39:40.750 --> 39:41.834
MAYBE.

39:41.834 --> 39:42.959
NO, PACEY,

39:42.959 --> 39:45.458
YOU WILL.

39:56.959 --> 39:59.667
HEY.

40:00.708 --> 40:01.834
HEY.

40:01.834 --> 40:05.041
UM...

40:05.041 --> 40:08.875
I BROUGHT THESE
BACK FOR YOU.

40:08.875 --> 40:11.291
THEY'RE
SO BEAUTIFUL, I--

40:11.291 --> 40:14.208
I'M NOT QUITE SURE
THEY'RE ME, BUT...

40:14.208 --> 40:16.625
REALLY FUN TIME
WEARING THEM.

40:18.834 --> 40:24.625
SO, I'M NOT GOING TO DENY THAT
WHEN YOU KISSED ME LAST NIGHT...

40:24.625 --> 40:26.667
I FELT SOMETHING.

40:28.792 --> 40:31.417
SOMETHING THAT I
WASN'T EXPECTING,
AND SOMETHING THAT...

40:31.417 --> 40:34.708
PROBABLY WILL
ALWAYS BE THERE.

40:38.542 --> 40:42.333
I CAN'T KEEP
HURTING PEOPLE, DAWSON,

40:42.333 --> 40:46.792
AND I CAN'T CHOOSE,

40:46.792 --> 40:51.500
SO I'M TELLING YOU
THE SAME THING
THAT I TOLD PACEY.

40:53.125 --> 40:55.375
PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME.

40:55.375 --> 40:58.917
I'M NOT READY,
AND I CAN'T DO IT.

41:03.333 --> 41:04.959
OK.

41:04.959 --> 41:06.041
OK?

41:06.041 --> 41:07.959
I'LL WAIT.

41:07.959 --> 41:10.250
YOU CAN CALL ME
AN ETERNAL OPTIMIST,

41:10.250 --> 41:13.250
BUT I HAVE FAITH.

41:16.792 --> 41:19.166
THIS WHOLE YEAR,
I'VE BEEN ON THIS...

41:19.166 --> 41:21.291
SOUL-SEARCHING
JOURNEY...

41:24.166 --> 41:25.708
AND I FEEL LIKE
I'VE FINALLY COME
TO THE END.

41:29.083 --> 41:32.000
AND WHAT I FOUND...

41:32.000 --> 41:34.500
WAS YOU.

41:42.375 --> 41:43.834
MITCH!
WHAT?

41:43.834 --> 41:45.166
MITCH.

41:45.166 --> 41:46.667
COME HERE.

41:46.667 --> 41:47.667
WHAT IS IT?

41:47.667 --> 41:48.667
JUST COME HERE.

41:48.667 --> 41:51.250
UM, HERE, SIT DOWN.

41:53.166 --> 41:55.458
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?

41:55.458 --> 41:56.959
JUST THIS.

41:59.458 --> 42:02.000
LAST NIGHT,
YOU ASKED ME

42:02.000 --> 42:04.208
TO DEFINE THIS
RELATIONSHIP,

42:04.208 --> 42:05.875
AND I WASN'T
READY TO DO IT.

42:05.875 --> 42:07.750
I HAVE JUST BEEN
SO AFRAID OF--

42:07.750 --> 42:08.708
OF SCREWING UP,

42:08.708 --> 42:11.750
OF MAKING
THE SAME
MISTAKES TWICE.

42:13.250 --> 42:15.333
BUT I'M NOT
GONNA LET
THAT FEAR STOP US

42:15.333 --> 42:16.834
FROM BEING TOGETHER
ANYMORE.

42:19.000 --> 42:23.208
SO, IF OUR FATE
IS TO MAKE

42:23.208 --> 42:24.834
THE SAME MISTAKES
ALL OVER AGAIN,

42:24.834 --> 42:28.375
THEN BY GOD,
I HOPE WE MAKE
THOSE MISTAKES

42:28.375 --> 42:31.291
AS WELL AS WE DID
THE FIRST TIME.

42:33.917 --> 42:36.208
IS THAT A YES?

42:36.208 --> 42:38.917
WELL, YOU DIDN'T
ASK ME A QUESTION.

42:38.917 --> 42:41.125
YOU KNOW
THE QUESTION.

42:42.917 --> 42:43.792
YOU KNOW
THE ANSWER.
