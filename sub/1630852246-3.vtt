It's the reason
I didn't go back with Rider.

21:10.708 --> 21:14.416
Well, you still have an important role
to play here in Centaurworld. [laughing]

21:14.500 --> 21:18.750
But also, there are probably
other reasons you'd stay, right? Right?

21:18.833 --> 21:20.416
Friends? Certain friends?

21:20.500 --> 21:22.958
Specific friends, maybe? [chuckles]

21:23.041 --> 21:26.375
Uh, me? Me, maybe? Wammawink? Hm?

21:26.458 --> 21:28.791
Oh, she does have an important role.

21:28.875 --> 21:30.750
Wait, what? No! No!

21:30.833 --> 21:33.333
[yelling]

21:33.416 --> 21:34.625
[Durpleton] Durple-drop!

-[grunts]

21:37.041 --> 21:39.208
[Ched chuckles] Boom. Ice cube. Told ya.

21:40.625 --> 21:43.791
[Durpleton] Hey, if we ever come back,
do you think it'd be okay

21:43.875 --> 21:47.625
if I asked a bunch of the puffintaurs
to just pile on top of me for a while?

21:47.708 --> 21:51.083
Or would that be weird?
Thank you. Please advise. Love, Durpleton.

21:53.083 --> 21:55.083
[mysterious music playing]

21:57.958 --> 21:59.166
[slurping]

22:01.916 --> 22:03.583
[flutters]

22:04.458 --> 22:06.041
Ah, ah. Use your words.

22:08.791 --> 22:10.208
[neighs]

22:10.291 --> 22:11.375
-Good girl.
-[crunching]

22:12.416 --> 22:13.333
You're welcome.

22:16.958 --> 22:19.375
-[neighs]
-Becky Apples, heel!

22:19.458 --> 22:22.416
Oh! Go… My Lord! What are you?

22:22.500 --> 22:25.958
I have come from afar
with a message of words.

22:26.041 --> 22:26.875
[clears throat]

22:26.958 --> 22:28.416
Oh, boy. I must do this fast.

22:28.500 --> 22:30.750
-My ink is running away.
-[panting]

22:30.833 --> 22:33.750
"The Nowhere King
is using a magical artifact

22:33.833 --> 22:35.583
to create super beasts."

22:35.666 --> 22:40.291
So many super beasts. Boulder shoulders.
Legs for days. Winged tentacles.

22:40.375 --> 22:44.750
One of them is bear parts.
Also, have you seen a pangolin before?

22:44.833 --> 22:49.791
They've got… Got these, like,
weird, odd spike scale things.

22:49.875 --> 22:51.291
It's very disturbing!

22:52.833 --> 22:59.291
In all my years, I have never encountered
such sublime strength, Rebecca Apples!

22:59.375 --> 23:00.500
