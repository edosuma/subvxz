20:42.893 --> 20:44.852
[crowd chanting]

20:44.895 --> 20:47.855
I copy.[gasps]
What are you doing here?

20:47.898 --> 20:49.813
Chill.[sighs]

20:49.857 --> 20:51.989
Keeping tabs
on the Skorpion, man.

20:52.033 --> 20:54.035
Wait, that's the guy who
put Chuck in the hospital?

20:54.078 --> 20:56.777
Yes.God, I'd love five minutes
in the ring with him.

20:56.820 --> 20:59.258
If he was at the
Vatican attack,

20:59.301 --> 21:01.390
he's got to be one of the
Khan's top lieutenants.

21:01.434 --> 21:04.567
Well, he's gonna
lead us right to Kate.Mm.

21:04.611 --> 21:06.395
Hey, how much money
do you have on you?

21:06.439 --> 21:08.919
About $500.$500.

21:08.963 --> 21:11.139
Oh, your watch here.
Give me your watch.

21:11.182 --> 21:14.229
Hell to the no.
It's worth $30,000.

21:14.273 --> 21:15.970
You spent $30,000 on a watch?

21:16.013 --> 21:17.972
Do I look like I pay retail?

21:18.015 --> 21:19.190
Give it to me.No.

21:19.234 --> 21:20.670
Shaw.Danny.

21:20.714 --> 21:23.064
Give it to me now.I am not giving you my w...

21:23.107 --> 21:24.152
[sighs]

21:24.195 --> 21:26.110
Hold on.
Hold on, hold on.

21:27.982 --> 21:30.071
You see what
I'm seeing, right?

21:31.290 --> 21:33.204
Yeah.You got Japanese,Chinese,

21:33.248 --> 21:35.468
Russian, and the skinny guy
looks Hispanic.

21:35.511 --> 21:37.905
Yeah, I'm guessing
Yakuza, Triad, Bratva,

21:37.948 --> 21:39.428
maybe Zetas.

21:39.472 --> 21:41.038
[sighs]

21:41.082 --> 21:42.997
It's like the United Nations
of bad guys in there.

21:43.040 --> 21:45.216
Exactly.

21:45.260 --> 21:47.393
So don't lose my watch.

21:47.436 --> 21:49.003
[clicks tongue]

21:50.004 --> 21:51.745
That'll work.

21:54.400 --> 21:57.359
[grunting]

21:57.403 --> 22:00.057
[crowd shouting]

22:00.101 --> 22:02.146
Do you know what I went through
in that place?

22:02.190 --> 22:04.018
While you were out...

22:04.061 --> 22:05.541
drinking...

22:05.585 --> 22:08.152
partying...

22:08.196 --> 22:09.502
and having fun?

22:09.545 --> 22:11.373
[whispers]:
I know.

22:11.417 --> 22:12.722
And it haunted me.

22:15.725 --> 22:17.423
I made a mistake!

22:20.426 --> 22:22.166
Sure did, Lulu.

22:25.735 --> 22:27.868
Don't call me Lulu.

22:29.260 --> 22:30.871
[grunts]

22:34.309 --> 22:36.485
Ah. Howdy, y'all.

22:36.529 --> 22:38.661
[whoops] Tell you what,

22:38.705 --> 22:40.620
that is some serious fighting
out there.

22:40.663 --> 22:42.230
You know what I mean, hoss?

22:42.273 --> 22:43.623
[chuckles]

22:43.666 --> 22:46.321
Jiminy Christmas.

22:46.365 --> 22:48.671
So... what's the game?

22:48.715 --> 22:50.151
Tien gow.

22:51.457 --> 22:52.806
You know how to play?

22:52.849 --> 22:55.504
Please tell me
you know how to play.

22:55.548 --> 22:58.464
We playing Heavens Nines
or are we Turning?

22:58.507 --> 23:01.075
Playing Heavens Nines.

23:01.118 --> 23:02.859
SHAW [over radio]:
Danny McNamara,

23:02.903 --> 23:04.905
you have unsuspected depths.

23:04.948 --> 23:07.298
I'm gonna check
on the skank beating.

23:07.342 --> 23:10.214
You're here to prove your worth
to the Great Khan?

23:10.258 --> 23:13.609
Oh, I can't wait to show him
what I'm capable of.

23:17.047 --> 23:19.006
Okay.

23:19.049 --> 23:20.007
All right.

23:20.050 --> 23:21.312
I see you guys

23:21.356 --> 23:22.879
are all in the gang already.

23:22.923 --> 23:24.141
[chuckles]

23:24.185 --> 23:25.360
Okay.

23:25.404 --> 23:27.231
Isn't that swell?

23:27.275 --> 23:29.625
SHAW:
Danny, they're all
a part of the Khan's group.

23:29.669 --> 23:31.932
These boys do not play
in the same sandbox.

23:33.716 --> 23:36.632
Let's get down
to business, then.

23:36.676 --> 23:40.070
I represent the Fraternity
of Freedom out of Houston.

23:40.114 --> 23:42.812
We heard about your
Khan after that...

23:42.856 --> 23:47.208
amazing display of supremacy
at the Vatican.

23:47.251 --> 23:49.428
We were impressed.

23:49.471 --> 23:51.342
We want in.

23:51.386 --> 23:53.475
I'm listening.

23:54.520 --> 23:57.479
Our business is guns, naturally.

23:57.523 --> 24:01.309
Tell you what, you
would be amazed

24:01.352 --> 24:04.138
at how much American military
ordnance, artillery

24:04.181 --> 24:07.576
and armored transpo just goes...
[whistles] missing

24:07.620 --> 24:09.622
in Afghanistan.

24:09.665 --> 24:11.319
We netted $1.1...

24:11.362 --> 24:13.234
billion last year.

24:13.277 --> 24:16.106
So, hey...

24:16.150 --> 24:17.586
if a game of dominos

24:17.630 --> 24:19.283
will convince you
I'm worthy of doing business

24:19.327 --> 24:22.896
with your Khan...

24:22.939 --> 24:25.638
gentlemen,
let's play some dominos.

24:26.639 --> 24:30.207
The Fraternity of Freedom
is welcome.

24:30.251 --> 24:32.993
Let's see what America brings
to the table.

24:33.036 --> 24:34.603
All right,

24:34.647 --> 24:36.431
all right, all right.

24:36.475 --> 24:38.085
[shouts]

24:38.128 --> 24:40.522
[crowd shouting]

25:00.586 --> 25:02.501
[panting]:
Uh...

25:02.544 --> 25:05.329
listen, I can't pull my punches
any longer.

25:05.373 --> 25:07.375
Let's just call this a draw.

25:07.418 --> 25:09.769
Uh. Okay.

25:22.085 --> 25:23.347
[grunts, pants]

25:23.391 --> 25:25.959
Oh, don't be
so dramatic.

25:26.002 --> 25:28.570
I saw an opportunity
for a well-earned ass-kicking,

25:28.614 --> 25:30.137
and I took it.

25:30.180 --> 25:32.879
I'd hardly call that an
ass-kicking. [groans]

25:32.922 --> 25:35.272
I was angry,
for a long time.

25:36.447 --> 25:39.581
At you and at the world.

25:39.625 --> 25:41.278
But I did a lot
of soul-searching

25:41.322 --> 25:43.498
while I was in prison,
and you're right,

25:43.542 --> 25:45.631
I would have
left you behind, too.

25:46.632 --> 25:48.808
Yes, you would have.

25:48.851 --> 25:50.984
Yeah. I tried to write you
to tell you all was forgiven,

25:51.027 --> 25:52.942
but it's kind of hard
to write someone

25:52.986 --> 25:54.422
that doesn't have an address.

25:54.465 --> 25:56.206
[snickers]

25:56.250 --> 25:58.426
What are you doing here, anyway?

25:59.427 --> 26:02.648
Have you ever heard
of the Soul of Genghis Khan?

26:02.691 --> 26:04.519
Priceless 13th-century relic

26:04.563 --> 26:06.695
that supposedly
carries his spirit.

26:06.739 --> 26:09.002
No, never heard of it.

26:09.045 --> 26:10.786
The Great Khan put
a million-dollar bounty on it.

26:10.830 --> 26:13.049
Is that why you guys are here,
trying to snake my payday?

26:13.093 --> 26:14.964
[scoffs]You and that glass

26:15.008 --> 26:16.792
of skim milk
that I saw you with?

26:16.836 --> 26:18.185
His name is Danny.

26:19.360 --> 26:21.492
Let's get you stitched up.

26:21.536 --> 26:23.973
[crowd shouts continue
in distance]

26:26.367 --> 26:28.543
Well, do you have
any lidocaine?

26:28.587 --> 26:30.589
You've gone soft, Lulu.

26:30.632 --> 26:32.547
I've become refined.

26:32.591 --> 26:34.070
Uh-huh.

26:34.114 --> 26:35.898
Because of your new beau, huh?

26:35.942 --> 26:37.552
[grunts]How long has that been going on?

26:37.596 --> 26:38.684
[exhales]

26:38.727 --> 26:40.511
Four months, officially.

26:40.555 --> 26:42.383
And you haven't
cut and run?

26:42.426 --> 26:45.212
Isn't that your
signature move?

26:45.255 --> 26:47.388
[groans]Sorry. Cheap shot.

26:47.431 --> 26:50.521
I'm just saying, four days
is usually too long for you.

26:50.565 --> 26:52.741
Yeah, well, Danny's different.

26:52.785 --> 26:55.178
Oh, please.Look,

26:55.222 --> 26:58.573
I have spent my whole life
wandering the world,

26:58.617 --> 27:02.185
refusing to set down roots
for whatever reason.

27:02.229 --> 27:04.100
Maybe it's time to see
how the other half lives.

27:04.144 --> 27:05.536
And that's what he wants?

27:06.581 --> 27:08.801
We...are trying
to take it slow.

27:08.844 --> 27:11.499
Look, men don't take it slow.

27:11.542 --> 27:13.327
They just... they just stall

27:13.370 --> 27:15.111
until they can leave,

27:15.155 --> 27:16.852
or until you leave them.

27:19.376 --> 27:21.509
Things are good.

27:21.552 --> 27:23.250
Okay?

27:23.293 --> 27:24.730
Things are very good.

27:24.773 --> 27:26.732
Ai ya.

27:26.775 --> 27:28.516
What?

27:28.559 --> 27:30.953
I've never seen this in you.

27:30.997 --> 27:33.042
Yes, I'm...

27:33.086 --> 27:35.741
I'm head over heels.
I'm, you know...

27:35.784 --> 27:38.004
I don't particularly care
for the L-word.

27:38.047 --> 27:40.397
No, no, no, it's not
that. You're scared.

27:40.441 --> 27:42.704
You finally have something
to lose, and...

27:42.748 --> 27:45.881
you're afraid your boyfriend
might pull the plug.

27:47.491 --> 27:50.103
Danny is not going anywhere.

27:52.409 --> 27:55.325
Yeah. Yeah, yeah,
I'm sure you're right.

28:13.953 --> 28:15.519
Father Alonso.

28:15.563 --> 28:16.869
What a surprise.

28:16.912 --> 28:18.609
Father Donnelly.

28:18.653 --> 28:21.134
You're looking better
every day.

28:21.177 --> 28:23.702
How can I help you, Father?

28:23.745 --> 28:25.268
The Swiss Guard
has concluded

28:25.312 --> 28:27.314
its investigation...

28:27.357 --> 28:30.491
and discovered a traitor
in their midst.

28:30.534 --> 28:32.972
The terrorists had
an inside man

28:33.015 --> 28:35.148
in the Swiss Guard?

28:35.191 --> 28:37.324
Yeah, the turncoat
has been handed over,

28:37.367 --> 28:39.108
and the matter is...

28:39.152 --> 28:41.328
now closed.

28:41.371 --> 28:43.504
What about the terrorists?

28:43.547 --> 28:46.028
My friends are in Vietnam
right now trying to find them.

28:46.072 --> 28:48.901
That is no longer your concern.

28:49.945 --> 28:53.209
And yet my concern persists.

28:54.907 --> 28:58.998
You have been through a lot,
Father Donnelly.

29:01.174 --> 29:03.480
You should
take some time

29:03.524 --> 29:05.395
and rest.

29:10.313 --> 29:12.359
I think you're right.

29:13.795 --> 29:15.797
I'm due for a vacation.

29:19.192 --> 29:21.237
Peace be with you.

29:26.373 --> 29:28.679
And with you, Chuck.

29:37.210 --> 29:39.865
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

29:39.908 --> 29:41.823
That is trick

29:41.867 --> 29:43.042
and...

29:43.085 --> 29:44.304
match.

29:44.347 --> 29:45.871
[laughs]

29:47.611 --> 29:49.222
Beginner's luck.

29:49.265 --> 29:51.050
Yep, maybe.

29:51.093 --> 29:52.486
[sighs]
But...

29:52.529 --> 29:54.444
I'd say I've more
than proven my worth.

29:54.488 --> 29:56.446
So... do I get to meet the Khan?

29:56.490 --> 29:57.970
The Great Khan.

29:58.013 --> 30:00.755
The Great Khan. Of course.

30:00.799 --> 30:03.410
How about another trick?
Double or nothing.

30:03.453 --> 30:05.847
Just the two of us.You know, no offense, amigo,

30:05.891 --> 30:08.371
but you're, uh,
a little low on funds there.

30:08.415 --> 30:11.244
And like a great
man once said,

30:11.287 --> 30:13.289
the quickest way
to double your money--

30:13.333 --> 30:15.465
fold it in half,
put it back in your pocket.

30:15.509 --> 30:16.510
[clicks tongue]

30:16.553 --> 30:17.903
Roy Rogers.

30:17.946 --> 30:20.383
[sighs]:
My boat--

30:20.427 --> 30:23.560
a Fountain 42 Lightning

30:23.604 --> 30:25.824
against all your winnings.

30:25.867 --> 30:27.869
Or should I tell the Great Khan

30:27.913 --> 30:29.958
that the Fraternity
of Freedom

30:30.002 --> 30:33.701
loses its nerve
when the stakes get too high?

30:35.529 --> 30:37.400
Let's do it.

30:46.583 --> 30:49.151
Danny, do you copy? Hello?

30:49.195 --> 30:51.937
Is anyone reading me?
I-I'm gonna go find Lexi.

31:00.728 --> 31:02.208
[Danny laughs]

31:02.251 --> 31:03.818
That is trick

31:03.862 --> 31:05.864
to me.

31:08.867 --> 31:10.781
Well played.

31:10.825 --> 31:12.479
Look...

31:12.522 --> 31:14.350
I don't want
your boat.

31:14.394 --> 31:16.004
All right?

31:16.048 --> 31:18.311
I came here to talk
to the Great Khan.

31:18.354 --> 31:20.835
That's all I'm interested in.

31:21.836 --> 31:23.577
Well,

31:23.620 --> 31:26.232
I make good on my bets.

31:27.624 --> 31:30.540
[keys jangle]The boat is yours.

31:32.542 --> 31:35.894
My men will take you
to the slip.

31:35.937 --> 31:38.287
And about my meeting? Uh...

31:41.508 --> 31:42.770
[indistinct chatter, cheering]

31:42.813 --> 31:44.554
[woman screams, groans]

31:44.598 --> 31:46.078
Lexi?

31:47.209 --> 31:48.341
Oh, Shaw.

31:48.384 --> 31:50.125
Get away from my friend.

31:50.169 --> 31:52.345
Hey. Hey, I-I'm fine.

31:52.388 --> 31:54.216
I'm fine. I am.

31:56.175 --> 31:58.742
Well, this friend
is more like it.

31:58.786 --> 32:01.528
Enchanté.

32:03.182 --> 32:04.400
I'm Shaw.

32:04.444 --> 32:06.141
LEXI:
Okay. Okay.

32:06.185 --> 32:07.969
Where's Danny?

32:08.013 --> 32:09.710
Listen, fellas...

32:09.753 --> 32:11.538
Look...

32:11.581 --> 32:14.628
I don't want
your boat, okay?
