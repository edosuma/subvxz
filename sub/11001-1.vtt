Oh, oh.

28:19.250 --> 28:22.791
Hey, man.

28:22.791 --> 28:25.041
How can Vladimir
be helping?

28:25.041 --> 28:28.541
- Uh, I'’m looking for Goran.
Have you seen him anywhere?

28:28.541 --> 28:31.416
- I think I see Goran
and your producer in barn.

28:31.416 --> 28:33.916
Come, I take you.

28:33.916 --> 28:37.041
So, uh...

28:37.041 --> 28:40.833
Alex tells me, uh,
you were in Afghanistan.

28:40.833 --> 28:44.666
- He does, huh?
Alex has a big mouth.

28:44.666 --> 28:48.083
- The reason I ask is because
I have friends

28:48.083 --> 28:50.208
who can get things
into Romania.

28:50.208 --> 28:52.208
And if you have friends
maybe get things

28:52.208 --> 28:55.541
out of Afghanistan,

28:55.541 --> 28:57.708

to smuggle heroin for you?

29:01.458 --> 29:03.250
- Is camera on?

29:03.250 --> 29:05.875
I--Vladimir would never
suggest such a thing.

29:05.875 --> 29:07.500
- This ain'’t on, man.
Film'’s expensive.

29:07.500 --> 29:08.875
I wouldn'’t just be
rolling it like that.

29:08.875 --> 29:12.750
- [laughs]

29:12.750 --> 29:15.750

29:33.291 --> 29:34.333
What the fuck is this?
- The camera is not on.

29:34.333 --> 29:36.250
We were just talking
about this.

29:36.250 --> 29:37.000

29:50.791 --> 29:52.083

you guys didn'’t get fired.

29:52.083 --> 29:53.083
- What--
- We get fired?

29:53.083 --> 29:54.750
Why would we get fired?

29:54.750 --> 29:56.375
She'’s the one--got soccer
dick up her snooze-hole.

29:56.375 --> 29:57.541

she'’s going to tell

29:57.541 --> 29:59.541
your Uncle Wallace
back in New York--

29:59.541 --> 30:00.875

30:08.958 --> 30:10.083
- Yeah, only--
only pretty much everybody.

30:10.083 --> 30:11.541
- What would she have done

30:11.541 --> 30:13.125
if Goran would have
been there today?

30:13.125 --> 30:14.625
- She would have been fine.
She'’s a total pro.

30:14.625 --> 30:16.291
She just
would have been like...

30:16.291 --> 30:20.291
- Stop!

[woman speaking native language]
- Aha.

- Just like butter.
- What are you talking about?

32:56.208 --> 32:57.416
- Nothing.
I'’ll tell you when you'’re older.

32:57.416 --> 32:59.458
- Ask your father.

32:59.458 --> 33:01.750

Many years ago...

beautiful woman builds home
outside Pavlovka.

33:22.250 --> 33:24.791
She never bother nobody.

33:24.791 --> 33:28.916
But she is stranger...

33:28.916 --> 33:32.916
and these were
very cautious times.

33:32.916 --> 33:36.291
So one day,
it happens in town.

33:36.291 --> 33:39.750
The cattle get sick.

33:39.750 --> 33:41.750
Children get sick.

33:41.750 --> 33:43.958
People start to die.

33:43.958 --> 33:46.333
Villagers want to know why.

33:46.333 --> 33:49.208
Why is this happening?
Who is to blame?

33:54.000 --> 33:58.583
They don'’t understand germs,
these people.

33:58.583 --> 34:01.333
So here you have
single woman,

[laughing]
Yeah.

34:22.916 --> 34:24.791
- What happened?

34:24.791 --> 34:28.375
- Well, villagers
go to her house.

34:28.375 --> 34:29.750
They tie her to stake.

34:29.750 --> 34:31.916
They burn her alive,
end of story.

34:31.916 --> 34:33.833
Millions times this happens.

34:33.833 --> 34:35.333

34:35.333 --> 34:37.416
- Da.

34:37.416 --> 34:39.708

That'’s just the way it is.
That'’s just the way it is.

34:41.416 --> 34:42.750
I mean, it'’s no different

34:42.750 --> 34:44.750
than what we did in Salem
in the 1600s.

34:44.750 --> 34:46.583
- Yes, but in Pavlovka,

34:46.583 --> 34:49.416
this happens
only 100 years ago.

34:49.416 --> 34:52.666
100 years only.

34:52.666 --> 34:54.958
- That is awful.

34:54.958 --> 34:57.041
- Eh.
Not really.

34:57.041 --> 35:00.000
It'’s good for business.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.500
- Oh, shit,

35:02.500 --> 35:04.458
"The Burning Stake."

35:04.458 --> 35:06.541

Da.

35:20.708 --> 35:22.708
- It'’s "borsch."

35:22.708 --> 35:24.500
- I can'’t believe we'’re having
this conversation.

35:24.500 --> 35:25.958
- Everyone in America
says it with a T, Vladimir.

35:25.958 --> 35:28.416

36:31.583 --> 36:34.500
Maybe I visit today?

36:34.500 --> 36:36.125
- Uh...

36:36.125 --> 36:37.833
I--well, I don'’t think
I'’d be the person

36:37.833 --> 36:39.000
to talk to
about that, but--

36:39.000 --> 36:41.625
- Uh, Constable, hi.

36:41.625 --> 36:43.166
I am Kate Banks.
- Hi.

36:43.166 --> 36:45.541
This is my crew.
[chuckles]

36:45.541 --> 36:49.375
I-I know that they can be
a little enthusiastic,

36:49.375 --> 36:52.208
but I assure you we won'’t use
any of the footage

36:52.208 --> 36:53.500
that we shot
in your church.

36:53.500 --> 36:56.166
- [chuckles]
That would be appreciated.

36:56.166 --> 36:58.708
Uh, now I must ask,

36:58.708 --> 37:00.125
will you be finished today?

37:00.125 --> 37:01.791
- Yes, absolutely.

37:01.791 --> 37:04.208
Yes, we would love
to spend more time

37:04.208 --> 37:07.125
in your beautiful town,
but--

37:07.125 --> 37:09.958
- "Oh, we'’d just love to stay
in your beautiful town."

37:09.958 --> 37:11.291
Jesus, Kate.

37:11.291 --> 37:13.000
- What the fuck
did you want me to say?

37:13.000 --> 37:14.208
The guy had a gun.

37:14.208 --> 37:16.291
- [laughing]

37:16.291 --> 37:19.291
Kate, you think like native.
Gun always wins.

37:19.291 --> 37:21.916
- Okay, okay, all right.
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

37:21.916 --> 37:24.708
Okay, I just--
Daddy doesn'’t feel good.

37:24.708 --> 37:27.166
- It sounds like you guys
had so much fun.

37:27.166 --> 37:30.250
I wish I'’d go in town more.

37:30.250 --> 37:32.333
Hey, are you gonna film
absolutely everything?

37:32.333 --> 37:34.500
- Yeah, it'’s just something
we do.

37:34.500 --> 37:36.250
- So we'’ve got six more hours
of good light.

37:36.250 --> 37:38.041
- Oh. [laughs]
- Guys, get set up.

37:38.041 --> 37:39.458
Sarah, you'’re with me.
Come on.

37:39.458 --> 37:41.416
- Okeydoke.

37:41.416 --> 37:42.666
- Becky, I think it'’s great
right by that tree.

37:42.666 --> 37:45.833
- Okay.
- Let'’s get a close-up.

37:45.833 --> 37:48.875
Uh, just be natural.

37:48.875 --> 37:51.833
- Right, okay.
Um...

37:51.833 --> 37:55.000
- [laughing]
Perfect.

37:55.000 --> 37:57.083
- All right, so...
- Okay.

37:57.083 --> 37:59.250
- To camera.
- Okay, fine.

37:59.250 --> 38:01.916
- Do you have
a lot neighbors close by?

38:01.916 --> 38:05.291
- No. My nearest neighbor
is about two miles away.

38:05.291 --> 38:06.875
- And do you have them over?

38:06.875 --> 38:08.750
Do you have dinner parties
with them?

38:08.750 --> 38:10.375
- I think they think
I'’m weird.

38:10.375 --> 38:11.500
Like, who would live
all the way out here

38:11.500 --> 38:13.208
if they didn'’t have to?

38:13.208 --> 38:15.458
- Oh, they don'’t find
country life romantic?

38:15.458 --> 38:18.333
- [chuckles]
Yeah, I guess not.

38:18.333 --> 38:19.916
I have some ferns, of course,
you know?

38:19.916 --> 38:22.041
Um, very hot peppers.

38:22.041 --> 38:25.500
Um, I have, uh, mandrake.

38:25.500 --> 38:28.541
- Mm, growing
some aphrodisiacs, huh?

38:28.541 --> 38:31.541
- Okay, we'’re done.
Sarah.

38:31.541 --> 38:33.916
I know that
you'’re Wallace'’s niece,

38:33.916 --> 38:35.750
but out here,
I'’m you'’re fucking boss.

38:35.750 --> 38:37.791
- I was trying to help.
- Sarah, shut the fuck up.

38:37.791 --> 38:40.333
- Oh, come on, Kate.
- I know that you just graduated

38:40.333 --> 38:42.958
from film school and you think
that you know everything,

38:42.958 --> 38:45.125
but you don'’t, okay?

38:45.125 --> 38:46.750
You don'’t.

38:46.750 --> 38:48.583
And the only way
that you'’re going to learn

38:48.583 --> 38:50.916
is by keeping
your fucking mouth shut

38:50.916 --> 38:53.333
and watching the professionals
do their jobs.

38:53.333 --> 38:55.333
You understand?

38:55.333 --> 38:57.791
Do you understand?

38:57.791 --> 39:01.875
- [breathing heavily]
- Sarah, are you okay?

39:01.875 --> 39:04.375
- Just stay out of her way.
Stick with us for a while.

39:04.375 --> 39:07.041
Let her calm down, all right?

39:09.541 --> 39:12.291
It isn'’t all bad,
I promise.

39:12.291 --> 39:13.833
- Are you guys sure
I'’m not in the way?

39:13.833 --> 39:15.041
- No, you'’re okay.
- Hey, guys.

39:15.041 --> 39:16.416
- Hey.
- Yo.

39:16.416 --> 39:18.250
- Are you filming
the cellar now?

39:18.250 --> 39:19.958
- Uh, we'’re not. We'’re gonna
shoot the ground floor

39:19.958 --> 39:22.375
while the light'’s good,
but later, yeah, for sure.

39:22.375 --> 39:24.416
- Okay.

39:24.416 --> 39:27.416
- I promise we'’ll get to it.
- Okay.

39:27.416 --> 39:29.541
- Fucking cutie-patootie.
- Mm-hmm.

39:29.541 --> 39:31.291
- Uh-huh.

39:31.291 --> 39:33.208
- What? Alex, is she your type?
- [chuckles]

39:33.208 --> 39:35.833
- [laughing]
Okay.

39:35.833 --> 39:37.666
- I want to get this fireplace,
but I'’m thinking, like,

39:37.666 --> 39:39.791
hot spot off the window--
it'’s not gonna look good.

39:39.791 --> 39:41.791
- How the fuck
did I do this?

39:41.791 --> 39:43.458
Um, you can just shoot it
from where she'’s standing.

39:43.458 --> 39:45.125
- Yeah?

39:45.125 --> 39:47.541
- Yeah,
it looks great from here.

39:47.541 --> 39:49.416
- I need the reflectors.

39:49.416 --> 39:51.125
- How'’s that?
- That'’s better.

39:51.125 --> 39:52.333
Becky, in your own time.

39:52.333 --> 39:54.750
- And it--it'’s just--

39:54.750 --> 39:57.000
I mean,
the whole house smells warm.

39:57.000 --> 39:59.375
The food comes out, like,
beautifully, just because--

39:59.375 --> 40:01.250
Pump. I don'’t know
if you remember before,

40:01.250 --> 40:03.250
but the water was,
you know,

40:03.250 --> 40:05.208
kind of came out dripping
and kind of green.

40:05.208 --> 40:08.208
And all of this wood here
is salvaged wood,

40:08.208 --> 40:11.375
so everything is getting
a renewed life.

40:11.375 --> 40:13.041
You know?

40:13.041 --> 40:15.375
So Goran did so much
on the outside here--

40:15.375 --> 40:19.208
the staining, detailing,
these slats.

40:19.208 --> 40:21.208
Anyway, um,
if you come inside,

40:21.208 --> 40:24.083
I can show you
some of my work here.

40:24.083 --> 40:28.083
Um, oh, and this fire
I have to tend to constantly.

40:28.083 --> 40:30.083
Placement really matters,
you know?

40:30.083 --> 40:32.750
It'’s not like working
with a commercial kiln at all,

40:32.750 --> 40:35.208
but it'’s really cool,
you know--

40:35.208 --> 40:37.750
uh, go back to the old ways,
be part of tradition.

40:37.750 --> 40:40.291
[frog croaks]
And the best part is,

40:40.291 --> 40:43.333
um, I made myself something
to remind me

40:43.333 --> 40:45.875
of how it was
when we first got here.

40:45.875 --> 40:48.041
And here'’s my little friend.

40:48.041 --> 40:51.750
- Oh, it'’s the cat
from the first segment.

40:51.750 --> 40:54.750
That is so cute.
- Jesus fucking Christ!

40:54.750 --> 40:56.625
Go make yourself useful

40:56.625 --> 40:59.083
and go get me
some B-roll shots, all right?

40:59.083 --> 41:02.458
Shoot some fucking trees,
some cows.

41:02.458 --> 41:05.833
Just get the fuck
out of my face.

41:10.708 --> 41:13.666
- I paid $150,000
at film school

41:13.666 --> 41:16.500
to film trees.

41:16.500 --> 41:18.541
We got it.
We got the B-roll you needed.

41:18.541 --> 41:20.541
We got this big-ass stump.

41:20.541 --> 41:22.416
Want some B-roll
of some stray dogs?

41:22.416 --> 41:23.833
Here you go.

41:23.833 --> 41:26.458
[mocking Kate]
The barn of passion...

41:26.458 --> 41:29.500
transformed from a place
where animals eat

41:29.500 --> 41:32.916
into a warm
and stylish fuckpad.

41:32.916 --> 41:33.916
[chuckles]

41:33.916 --> 41:35.125
[normal voice]
Skank.

41:39.875 --> 41:41.125
Huh.

41:41.125 --> 41:43.583
Looks like Becky
ran out of steam.

41:45.666 --> 41:48.083
[frog croaks]

41:48.083 --> 41:51.875
Oh, hello, señor frog.

41:51.875 --> 41:54.791
[frogs croaking]

41:59.666 --> 42:02.041
Whoa.

42:02.041 --> 42:04.583
[croaking increases in volume]

42:04.583 --> 42:06.958
What the hell is that?

42:06.958 --> 42:11.750
[croaking continues]

42:11.750 --> 42:15.750
[camera whirring]
Ah!

42:15.750 --> 42:17.458
[static hissing]

42:19.375 --> 42:21.000
- Who'’s a good dog?

42:21.000 --> 42:22.500
Who'’s my good boy?

42:22.500 --> 42:24.000
You want to be a TV star?
- Alex?

42:24.000 --> 42:25.375
- [imitating dog talking]
"I do Arrex."

42:25.375 --> 42:27.000
- Alex?
- "I do want to be a TV star."

42:27.000 --> 42:28.416
What'’s up?

42:28.416 --> 42:30.125
- Something'’s wrong
with the camera.

42:30.125 --> 42:32.208
- Oh, great.
Kate'’s gonna love that.

42:32.208 --> 42:33.375
You should go show it
to Greg.

42:33.375 --> 42:35.166
He'’s inside setting up
a shot.

42:35.166 --> 42:37.625
- Okay.
- Good boy want a Doina?

42:37.625 --> 42:39.166
Does a good boy
want a Doina?

42:39.166 --> 42:41.250
What'’s this?
It'’s a Doina.

42:41.250 --> 42:43.541
Yeah.
You don'’t like Doina?

42:43.541 --> 42:46.208
[camera beeps]

42:46.208 --> 42:49.125
- Uh, Greg, there'’s something
wrong with the camera.

42:49.125 --> 42:51.416
- Let'’s take a look.

42:51.416 --> 42:53.500
Did you try turning it
off and on?

42:53.500 --> 42:55.375
Sometimes that works.
- Yes.

42:55.375 --> 42:58.250
[camera chimes]
- Looks like it'’s working.

42:58.250 --> 43:00.583
- It was totally
fritzing out before.

43:00.583 --> 43:04.833
- Yeah.
No, it looks good to me now.

43:04.833 --> 43:07.250
So, uh,
what are you doing later?

43:09.416 --> 43:11.416
- I don'’t know.
I got this thing.

43:11.416 --> 43:13.000
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

43:13.000 --> 43:16.000
- What?
- Bumpy ride, bad food.

43:16.000 --> 43:17.416
- Oh, the "bumpy ride,
bad food" thing?

43:17.416 --> 43:19.250
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, I got one of those too.

43:19.250 --> 43:21.916
- Yeah.
- How about after that?

43:21.916 --> 43:23.875
- Wasn'’t gonna get this done,
so here we go.

43:23.875 --> 43:24.875
How hard could this be?

43:24.875 --> 43:28.458
[birds squawking]

43:28.458 --> 43:30.166
Uh, excuse me.

43:30.166 --> 43:33.041
Yes, I am Kate Banks,

43:33.041 --> 43:36.291
host and producer
of "Home Hunters Global."

43:36.291 --> 43:38.416
I know.
Oh, I'’ve got more fans.

43:38.416 --> 43:39.833
Okay.
[laughs]

43:39.833 --> 43:42.666
Oh, you guys are so great.

43:42.666 --> 43:45.041
So, uh, what'’s your favorite
part of the show?

43:45.041 --> 43:46.833
- Kate?
[chuckles nervously]

43:46.833 --> 43:50.208
Kate, you--Becky, she wants to
show us something inside.

43:50.208 --> 43:51.833
Come, come, come.
- All right.

43:51.833 --> 43:53.916
- [speaking native language]

43:53.916 --> 43:55.583
- So you guys remember
the wine cellar, right?

43:55.583 --> 43:57.583
- Right, yeah.
- You are not gonna believe

43:57.583 --> 44:00.291
what we found when we
started fixing this all up.

44:00.291 --> 44:01.791
- Cases of wine?

44:01.791 --> 44:04.375
- [laughing]
Yeah.

44:04.375 --> 44:06.666
All right, hold on.

44:06.666 --> 44:08.125
Here we go.

44:08.125 --> 44:09.375
Oh, can you grab
that light?

44:09.375 --> 44:10.708
- Mm-hmm.
- [screaming in the distance]

44:10.708 --> 44:11.875
- What was that?
- What the hell?

44:11.875 --> 44:14.208
- That'’s Alex.

44:14.208 --> 44:16.000
- What'’s going on?
- Alex!

44:16.000 --> 44:17.375
- [grunting]
- Oh, my gosh!

44:17.375 --> 44:20.208
- Get him off me!
[gunshot]

44:20.208 --> 44:23.166
[Alex and Sarah
breathing heavily]

44:23.166 --> 44:24.500
- Oh, my God, Alex, your arm!

44:24.500 --> 44:26.375
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, shit, oh, shit, oh, shit.

44:26.375 --> 44:27.875
Come on, come on, come on.
- Jesus Christ.

44:27.875 --> 44:29.166
- We need a blanket.
The guy'’s going into shock.

44:29.166 --> 44:31.166
- We don'’t have
a fucking blanket.

44:31.166 --> 44:32.541
- Then take off your jacket
and put it over his shoulder!

44:32.541 --> 44:34.083
- What the fuck
did he say about rabies?

44:34.083 --> 44:37.458
- Get him inside.
[indistinct shouting]

44:37.458 --> 44:39.083
- Keep your arm up!
- Doctor?

44:39.083 --> 44:41.583
What kind of hospital is this?
- Here we go.

44:41.583 --> 44:45.375
- I can'’t believe this is
the only doctor in town.

44:45.375 --> 44:47.541
- Only doctor in town
is best doctor in town.

44:47.541 --> 44:50.166
- We should have stayed
and finished the shoot.

44:50.166 --> 44:53.500
- Really, Kate?
With a dead sound tech?

44:53.500 --> 44:55.166
I'’d love to see you
explain that to Wallace.

44:55.166 --> 44:57.958
- Fuck Wallace.
Fuck this.

44:57.958 --> 45:01.208
How am I supposed to do a show
with a bunch of fuckups?

45:03.750 --> 45:05.416
I'’m going to get some air.

45:09.833 --> 45:11.375
- [sighs]
Greg, is he going to be okay?

45:11.375 --> 45:13.041
That was a lot of blood.

45:15.625 --> 45:17.166
- Yeah, I think Alex
is going to be fine.

45:17.166 --> 45:20.041
That wasn'’t...

45:20.041 --> 45:21.708
It wasn'’t that much blood.

45:25.000 --> 45:28.125
- So...

45:28.125 --> 45:30.708
uh, what happened
in Afghanistan?

45:32.750 --> 45:34.750
[door opens]

45:34.750 --> 45:37.000
- Game of badminton,
ladies?

45:37.000 --> 45:38.250

01:03:27.833 --> 01:03:30.250
Where the hell are we gonna go?
- Anywhere but here!

01:03:30.250 --> 01:03:32.208
- Jesus Christ.
[groans]

01:03:35.875 --> 01:03:38.875
[fireplace poker clangs]

01:03:38.875 --> 01:03:41.416
Becky, Goran--you said Goran'’s
coming in tomorrow morning.

01:03:41.416 --> 01:03:43.041
What time does
his flight land?

01:03:45.083 --> 01:03:47.041
- What?
- Goran, his flight--

01:03:47.041 --> 01:03:48.875
when does he land?

01:03:48.875 --> 01:03:50.083
- Um, 8:00 a.m.

01:03:50.083 --> 01:03:51.666
He said he was coming
straight here.

01:03:51.666 --> 01:03:53.083
- Okay, 8:00 a.m.
- Okay.

01:03:53.083 --> 01:03:54.208
- Right, it'’s
a two-hour flight.

01:03:54.208 --> 01:03:55.291
Kate?
- Yeah.

01:03:55.291 --> 01:03:56.916
He'’s in his car by 9:00.

01:03:56.916 --> 01:03:58.791
He'’s here by 11:00,
noon at the latest.

01:03:58.791 --> 01:04:00.916
- All right, assuming
that he didn'’t miss his flight.

01:04:00.916 --> 01:04:02.791
- I'’m sure he didn'’t
miss his flight.

01:04:02.791 --> 01:04:05.541
- Or the bridge isn'’t out or
those fucking maniacs out there

01:04:05.541 --> 01:04:07.791
didn'’t cut him up the way
they fucking cut up Vladimir!

01:04:07.791 --> 01:04:09.291
- Enough!

01:04:10.750 --> 01:04:13.208
- [crying]
I'’m sorry.

01:04:13.208 --> 01:04:15.083
Sorry.

01:04:18.208 --> 01:04:19.416
- Oh, that'’s
fucking great, Kate.

01:04:19.416 --> 01:04:21.958
That'’s fucking awesome.

01:04:21.958 --> 01:04:23.916
- Guys, listen,
here'’s the plan.

01:04:23.916 --> 01:04:25.791
We'’re gonna stay her tonight,
we'’re gonna wait for Goran,

01:04:25.791 --> 01:04:27.708
and we'’re gonna drive
out of here in the morning.

01:04:27.708 --> 01:04:29.708
- You don'’t give
orders, Greg.

01:04:29.708 --> 01:04:31.958
This is my production.

01:04:31.958 --> 01:04:35.708
- We'’re not making
the show anymore, Kate.

01:04:35.708 --> 01:04:37.625
- And yet
you'’re still filming.

01:04:37.625 --> 01:04:40.958
- That'’s because we film
everything from here on out...

01:04:40.958 --> 01:04:42.375
everything.

01:04:44.416 --> 01:04:48.166
- None of you
ever liked me.

01:04:48.166 --> 01:04:49.958
[scoffs]

01:04:49.958 --> 01:04:54.083
Do you know how many times
I covered for you guys?

01:04:55.708 --> 01:04:58.416
[scoffs]

01:04:58.416 --> 01:05:01.708
You'’ve all been laughing
at me this whole time.

01:05:03.791 --> 01:05:05.791
[scoffs]

01:05:05.791 --> 01:05:08.791
- The sun'’s going down.

01:05:08.791 --> 01:05:10.708
- Shit.

01:05:17.041 --> 01:05:20.041
[sighs]
Just making sure.

01:05:20.041 --> 01:05:21.791
- We need to get some sleep.

01:05:21.791 --> 01:05:24.500
- Yeah, that'’s great.
Who the fuck can sleep?

01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:26.500
- All right, great, man.
You take the first watch.

01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:27.500
Ladies.

01:05:27.500 --> 01:05:29.000
- You can take this room.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:30.625
- Okay, thanks, Becky.

01:05:30.625 --> 01:05:33.041
Listen, Sarah, I want you
to keep that camera rolling

01:05:33.041 --> 01:05:34.500
and then change
the batteries, all right?

01:05:34.500 --> 01:05:36.333
Thank you.

01:05:36.333 --> 01:05:38.791
- And, um, Sarah,
if you'’re okay with doubling up,

01:05:38.791 --> 01:05:42.250
you can share this room
with me, okay?

01:05:42.250 --> 01:05:45.166
See anything?
- No.

01:05:52.041 --> 01:05:55.166
Have you had a lot of problems
with these people before?

01:05:57.041 --> 01:06:00.041
- [chuckles awkwardly]

01:06:00.041 --> 01:06:02.625
Well, I don'’t speak
the language yet,

01:06:02.625 --> 01:06:05.125
but, um...

01:06:05.125 --> 01:06:08.583
I'’ve gotten some hard stares
at the market--

01:06:08.583 --> 01:06:11.625
single woman and all
living this far out of town.

01:06:11.625 --> 01:06:15.125
You know?

01:06:15.125 --> 01:06:17.250
And I don'’t go
to church.

01:06:19.583 --> 01:06:23.583
So I haven'’t gone
out of my way to...

01:06:23.583 --> 01:06:25.791
become part
of their community.

01:06:27.625 --> 01:06:29.791
But this is...

01:06:32.583 --> 01:06:35.125
[clicks tongue]

01:06:35.125 --> 01:06:37.791
I'’m really gonna miss
this house.

01:06:43.583 --> 01:06:46.250
[sobs softly]

01:06:53.583 --> 01:06:56.250
- [gasps]

01:06:59.125 --> 01:07:01.125
[whispering]
Oh, my God. What was that?

01:07:01.125 --> 01:07:04.958
Oh, my God.
[shuddering]

01:07:04.958 --> 01:07:07.875
[gasps, breathing shakily]

01:07:24.208 --> 01:07:27.958
[gasping]

01:07:27.958 --> 01:07:29.708
[frog croaks]
[sighs] Oh, my God.

01:07:29.708 --> 01:07:31.666
Oh, my God.

01:07:36.416 --> 01:07:38.666
- Yo.

01:07:38.666 --> 01:07:40.416
What are you doing up?

01:07:40.416 --> 01:07:41.958
- Can'’t sleep.

01:07:41.958 --> 01:07:44.208
- Yeah, I know.
Tell me about it.

01:07:44.208 --> 01:07:46.416
Kate went to sleep, like,
ten minutes after you guys left,

01:07:46.416 --> 01:07:49.666
stuck me with all
this fucking guard duty.

01:07:49.666 --> 01:07:52.958
- Well, Greg and I are gonna
take over in an hour, so...

01:07:52.958 --> 01:07:54.416
- Mm, that'’s great.

01:07:54.416 --> 01:07:57.416
Then I can go
and not sleep in there.

01:07:57.416 --> 01:07:59.458
- Listen, Goran'’s gonna be here
in the morning.

01:07:59.458 --> 01:08:01.666
All we have to do
is last through the night.

01:08:01.666 --> 01:08:04.041
- Yeah, I mean, that'’s assuming
he shows up in that SUV

01:08:04.041 --> 01:08:07.500
and doesn'’t ride in here
on a fucking Vespa or something.

01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:09.583
Look, I know Kate
is being a bitch,

01:08:09.583 --> 01:08:11.500
but this plan really does have
a lot of holes in it, you know?

01:08:11.500 --> 01:08:13.041
What if he does miss
his plane?

01:08:13.041 --> 01:08:14.750
What if the bridge
is washed out?

01:08:14.750 --> 01:08:16.250
What if he doesn'’t get here?

01:08:16.250 --> 01:08:17.625
And you know what?

01:08:17.625 --> 01:08:19.291
Even if he does get here,

01:08:19.291 --> 01:08:21.750
how do we know we can even trust
this fucking guy?

01:08:21.750 --> 01:08:24.750
He'’s one of them, right?

01:08:24.750 --> 01:08:26.707
- Vladimir was one of them.

01:08:29.041 --> 01:08:30.957
- I don'’t know.

01:08:37.791 --> 01:08:39.000
[sighs]

01:08:45.041 --> 01:08:46.707
- Greg?
- Aah! What the fuck?

01:08:46.707 --> 01:08:48.291
Get off me!
- Greg, it'’s just me!

01:08:48.291 --> 01:08:49.832
It'’s Sarah!
It'’s me. It'’s Sarah.

01:08:49.832 --> 01:08:52.041
It'’s Sarah. It'’s Sarah.
- You guys all right?

01:08:52.041 --> 01:08:54.041
- Yeah, it'’s okay!
We'’re fine!

01:08:54.041 --> 01:08:55.791
- Then stop freaking me out!

01:08:55.791 --> 01:08:58.707
- [breathing heavily]

01:09:10.582 --> 01:09:12.041
- Greg.

01:09:25.125 --> 01:09:29.582
- W-we were shooting...

01:09:29.582 --> 01:09:32.125
at an all-girls school...

01:09:32.125 --> 01:09:34.832
to...

01:09:34.832 --> 01:09:37.125
I don'’t know.

01:09:37.125 --> 01:09:38.832
[chuckles]

01:09:38.832 --> 01:09:42.041
To show how things
were changing over there.

01:09:44.832 --> 01:09:48.125
And we were--finished the shot.
We were leaving.

01:09:48.125 --> 01:09:49.375
We were walking
through the door,

01:09:49.375 --> 01:09:52.582
and these two local Taliban

01:09:52.582 --> 01:09:54.833
showed up.

01:09:54.833 --> 01:09:56.541
And this is the South.

01:09:56.541 --> 01:10:01.125
I mean, this isn'’t hard-core
Swat Valley Taliban.

01:10:01.125 --> 01:10:03.125
These are just
local bullies.

01:10:03.125 --> 01:10:05.500
You know, guys like this,
they just...

01:10:07.833 --> 01:10:11.375
They just come in,
and they...

01:10:11.375 --> 01:10:13.833
break some windows,

01:10:13.833 --> 01:10:16.375
and they flip some tables,
and they burn books,

01:10:16.375 --> 01:10:19.041
and then they lecture the women,
and they fuck off.

01:10:24.125 --> 01:10:26.041
But this time
was different...

01:10:30.375 --> 01:10:32.500
Because this time
they see me...

01:10:37.875 --> 01:10:40.041
And they see my camera...

01:10:43.375 --> 01:10:47.833
And the chance
to make a splash...

01:10:47.833 --> 01:10:50.041
to make the news
in America.

01:10:53.583 --> 01:10:55.375
[swallows hard]

01:10:55.375 --> 01:10:58.500
So they take
this little girl.

01:11:00.833 --> 01:11:03.125
She'’s maybe, like,
ten years old.

01:11:06.666 --> 01:11:08.458
She'’d just learned
to read and write.

01:11:08.458 --> 01:11:10.208
She was learning English.
I mean--

01:11:10.208 --> 01:11:13.583
Fuck!
The future of the country.

01:11:19.208 --> 01:11:22.583
And they pulled out
this big knife...

01:11:30.208 --> 01:11:32.583
And they made me film it.

01:11:38.666 --> 01:11:41.208
[snorts]

01:11:41.208 --> 01:11:44.708
[sobbing]

01:11:44.708 --> 01:11:46.458
- Greg, there was nothing
you could'’ve done.

01:11:46.458 --> 01:11:48.458
They had machine guns.
There'’s not--

01:11:48.458 --> 01:11:50.458
You couldn'’t have done anything
to stop them.

01:11:50.458 --> 01:11:53.666
- I didn'’t even try!
I didn'’t even try!

01:11:53.666 --> 01:11:56.666
[breathing heavily]

01:11:56.666 --> 01:11:58.875
I didn'’t even try.

01:12:46.541 --> 01:12:49.375
[inhales deeply]
Hey.

01:12:56.291 --> 01:12:58.750
What is it?
- Nothing.

01:12:58.750 --> 01:13:00.750
- All right,
come on, let'’s go.

01:13:06.125 --> 01:13:07.375
- What is that, a pipe?

01:13:07.375 --> 01:13:09.375
- Hey, wake up.
- What?

01:13:09.375 --> 01:13:11.291
- What the hell
were you thinking?

01:13:11.291 --> 01:13:13.375
- What? I'’m sorry. I was trying
to take the edge off.

01:13:13.375 --> 01:13:15.083
- Dude, why the fuck
would you want no edge?

01:13:15.083 --> 01:13:16.500
- You guys, where'’s Kate?

01:13:18.125 --> 01:13:20.208
- Oh, shit.

01:13:20.208 --> 01:13:21.625
- Becky, get up.
We got a problem.

01:13:21.625 --> 01:13:23.666
- Becky, Kate'’s missing.

01:13:23.666 --> 01:13:25.625
- She'’s not in the cellar.
- Shit.

01:13:25.625 --> 01:13:27.375
Way to go, Alex.

01:13:27.375 --> 01:13:29.375
- What do you want me
to say, dude? I'’m sorry, okay?

01:13:29.375 --> 01:13:31.625
- Why would she sneak off
without us?

01:13:31.625 --> 01:13:33.625
- '’Cause Kate looks out
for number one--that'’s why.

01:13:33.625 --> 01:13:35.375
- Exactly. Even if I was awake,
what am I gonna do--

01:13:35.375 --> 01:13:37.125
talk Kate from going out
the fucking door?

01:13:37.125 --> 01:13:40.375
- Shh.

01:13:40.375 --> 01:13:41.833
[distant moaning]

01:13:41.833 --> 01:13:45.041
[gasps]
We have to do something.

01:13:47.125 --> 01:13:50.041
- Help me.

01:13:58.541 --> 01:14:00.375
Help.

01:14:00.375 --> 01:14:03.208
- We can'’t just stand here,
you guys.

01:14:03.208 --> 01:14:05.708
- I'’m going.

01:14:05.708 --> 01:14:07.458
- D-d-don'’t go out there.

01:14:07.458 --> 01:14:09.166
They'’re trying to lure us
out there.

01:14:09.166 --> 01:14:11.916
It'’s a trap.
I swear to God, Greg, please.

01:14:11.916 --> 01:14:13.666
- He'’s right.
You can'’t do it alone.

01:14:13.666 --> 01:14:15.333
- Thank you.

01:14:15.333 --> 01:14:16.708
- Okay, we'’ll all go
out together.

01:14:16.708 --> 01:14:18.208
- What the fuck?
Why? Why?

01:14:18.208 --> 01:14:20.125
Kate wouldn'’t do it
for us.

01:14:22.708 --> 01:14:25.000
What?
She wouldn'’t.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:26.750
- You guys good?
both: Yeah.

01:14:26.750 --> 01:14:29.458
- All right, come on. Come on.
- Oh, fuck me, man.

01:14:29.458 --> 01:14:30.916
- Watch your step.
- I can'’t--

01:14:30.916 --> 01:14:33.458
- Shh, shh, shh.
- Shit.

01:14:33.458 --> 01:14:35.708
- Don'’t fucking wave that poker
in my face.

01:14:35.708 --> 01:14:38.458
- Okay.
Uh, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

01:14:38.458 --> 01:14:40.208
- Becky.
- Okay, I know.

01:14:40.208 --> 01:14:42.708
- Shh.
- Sarah, what do you see?

01:14:42.708 --> 01:14:45.166
- I can'’t see anything.
Sarah, can you see anything?

01:14:45.166 --> 01:14:46.458
[distant moaning]
I hear something.

01:14:46.458 --> 01:14:48.708
Sarah?

01:14:48.708 --> 01:14:51.916
- I can'’t see my fucking hand
in front of my face.

01:14:51.916 --> 01:14:54.208
- Alex, shut the fuck up.
There'’s people out here.

01:14:54.208 --> 01:14:56.458
[distant gasp]
I heard something.

[Sarah crying]

01:15:58.625 --> 01:16:00.000

Just go fucking help Alex!

It'’s covered in dust.
- What are you saying?

01:16:33.875 --> 01:16:35.083
- Oh, my God, the barn.

01:16:35.083 --> 01:16:36.583
Holy shit.
Where'’s your laptop?

01:16:36.583 --> 01:16:37.875
- What the fuck
are you talking about?

01:16:37.875 --> 01:16:38.791
- Get your laptop out.

01:16:38.791 --> 01:16:41.083
Come up.

01:16:41.083 --> 01:16:43.333
Where the fuck is it?

[indistinct chatter
on laptop]

01:16:47.291 --> 01:16:49.083

- It'’s not even on.
- The camera isn'’t on.

01:16:52.666 --> 01:16:54.875

She'’s right the fuck

- Okay. Okay. Okay.

01:17:17.708 --> 01:17:21.166
So she'’s a fucking psychopath.
She saw them.

She killed Goran.
She killed Kate.

01:17:24.166 --> 01:17:25.958
Why the fuck
did she kill Vladimir?

01:17:25.958 --> 01:17:29.458
- I don'’t know.

01:17:29.458 --> 01:17:31.916
Because he saw.

Greg.

01:17:33.458 --> 01:17:34.958

Come on! Come on!

01:17:44.708 --> 01:17:46.708
- I can'’t go down there
with her.

01:17:46.708 --> 01:17:48.416
- For once in your life!

01:17:48.416 --> 01:17:50.416
I'’m not gonna stand around
debating this with you.

01:17:50.416 --> 01:17:53.166
Go downstairs now!

- [gasps]

01:18:27.791 --> 01:18:30.791

- Alex?

01:18:58.791 --> 01:19:00.500
Greg, I have to tell you
something.

01:19:00.500 --> 01:19:02.333
- I keep this down here
in case of emergency.

01:19:02.333 --> 01:19:03.875
- It'’s 3:00 now. We got 8 hours
until Goran shows up.

01:19:03.875 --> 01:19:05.666
We got to take that thing
out of you.

01:19:05.666 --> 01:19:07.708
- No, we'’re not taking
this thing out of me,

01:19:07.708 --> 01:19:09.041
'’cause this is the thing that'’s
fucking plugging the hole!

01:19:09.041 --> 01:19:11.875

Trust me. Come on.

That'’s it. That'’s it.

01:19:33.625 --> 01:19:35.291
- Can you deal with this?

01:19:37.333 --> 01:19:39.291
- Bite down.
Bite down if you have to.

01:19:39.291 --> 01:19:40.875
Are you done screaming?

01:19:40.875 --> 01:19:43.875
You done screaming?

- Do you like it?
- What the hell'’s going on?

01:20:56.333 --> 01:20:57.875
- Greg, she'’s crazy.

01:20:57.875 --> 01:21:01.375
She killed Goran,
and she killed Kate,

01:21:01.375 --> 01:21:03.208
and she killed Vladimir.

01:21:03.208 --> 01:21:05.208
- Sarah, what the hell
are you talking about?

01:21:05.208 --> 01:21:06.958
- She saw them together
in the barn.

01:21:06.958 --> 01:21:09.583
His car is in the barn.

01:21:09.583 --> 01:21:11.208
- All right, just--just--
just calm down.

01:21:11.208 --> 01:21:12.958
- I'’m not gonna
fucking calm down!

01:21:12.958 --> 01:21:14.791
Look at this mural right now.
That'’s us!

01:21:14.791 --> 01:21:16.166
That is us!

01:21:16.166 --> 01:21:18.416
She planned
this whole entire thing.

01:21:18.416 --> 01:21:21.416
- No.
- She painted about it.

01:21:21.416 --> 01:21:23.416
- I didn'’t pain that.

01:21:23.416 --> 01:21:25.708
That was always here.

01:21:25.708 --> 01:21:27.916
Iwas always here.
- What?

01:21:27.916 --> 01:21:30.166
- I was just waiting...

01:21:30.166 --> 01:21:33.958
for Becky, for you.

01:21:33.958 --> 01:21:35.416
- Becky, what
are you talking about?

01:21:35.416 --> 01:21:40.208
- Dude, she is
fucking psychotic, okay?

01:21:40.208 --> 01:21:41.708
- All right.
- Listen to me.

01:21:41.708 --> 01:21:43.416
She thinks she'’s a witch.
- Okay.

01:21:43.416 --> 01:21:45.416
- And those hicks
up there do too.

01:21:45.416 --> 01:21:47.541
- All right, just--just back
the fuck off.

01:21:47.541 --> 01:21:49.958
- They'’re not here to kill us.
They'’re here to kill her.

01:21:49.958 --> 01:21:51.708
We'’re just in the way.

01:21:51.708 --> 01:21:53.708
- No.

01:21:53.708 --> 01:21:55.958
I want you here...

01:21:55.958 --> 01:22:00.708
to record what happens,
like in the mural.

01:22:00.708 --> 01:22:03.041
Let'’s start with a close-up.

01:22:03.041 --> 01:22:06.500
- Becky, what--
- Aah!

01:22:06.500 --> 01:22:08.291
- Becky...
- Dude.

01:22:08.291 --> 01:22:09.791
- Just let go of that,
all right, Becky?

01:22:09.791 --> 01:22:12.250
Becky.
Let go of Sarah, Becky.

01:22:12.250 --> 01:22:14.791

- Sarah?
[fireplace poker clatters]

- Oh, my God!
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

01:22:18.500 --> 01:22:20.041
- [crying]
It'’s Goran.

- What--
- No, Becky.

01:22:25.041 --> 01:22:26.791
Becky, what are you doing?

01:22:26.791 --> 01:22:29.541
Okay.
- Oh, my--

[sobs]

01:22:31.625 --> 01:22:34.041
- Becky. Becky, listen to me.
It'’s Greg. Becky.

01:22:34.041 --> 01:22:35.791
Becky, just put that down.

01:22:35.791 --> 01:22:37.500
You don'’t have to do that,
all right?

01:22:37.500 --> 01:22:40.250
Let'’s just talk.
Becky.

01:22:40.250 --> 01:22:42.791
- Greg.

01:22:42.791 --> 01:22:45.458
- Greg!

Go now!
