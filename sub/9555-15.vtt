01:20.581 --> 01:21.673
Mom?

01:21.815 --> 01:23.340
Where is everybody this morning?

01:23.483 --> 01:25.383
Well, let me see.

01:25.519 --> 01:27.920
- Your father is outside
looking for the paper, -Oh.

01:28.055 --> 01:30.752
And your sister is studying
for her geometry test.

01:30.891 --> 01:33.087
Well, I-l need an audience,
Mom, an audience.

01:33.226 --> 01:35.092
Today is the debate
for class president.

01:35.228 --> 01:36.457
Me versus Fred Collins.

01:36.597 --> 01:38.156
I got to practice
my speech here.

01:39.266 --> 01:40.427
Mom, I'm under a lot
of pressure.

01:40.567 --> 01:41.762
Oh, yes, yes, dear.

01:41.902 --> 01:44.234
<i>L-I'll</i> be very happy
to listen to you.

01:44.371 --> 01:45.566
Oh, good. All right.

01:45.706 --> 01:47.265
- Okay, go ahead.
- Have a seat.

01:47.407 --> 01:48.306
(clears throat) Okay.

01:48.442 --> 01:50.069
Uh, the debate
will go like this.

01:50.210 --> 01:52.474
First, I'll be introduced...

01:52.613 --> 01:54.445
You know where
he threw it today?

01:54.581 --> 01:56.049
On the porch. On the porch.

01:56.183 --> 01:57.344
- On the porch.
- Well...

01:57.484 --> 01:59.213
Took me ten minutes
before I found it.

01:59.353 --> 02:00.582
I almost froze to death.

02:00.721 --> 02:03.190
Well, he's supposed to throw it
on the porch, dear.

02:03.323 --> 02:05.121
Well, it's the first time
in two years, Marion.

02:05.258 --> 02:06.191
Dad. Uh, Mom?

02:06.326 --> 02:08.351
Well, everybody has an off day.

02:08.495 --> 02:09.985
Yeah, when I delivered
papers as a kid,

02:10.130 --> 02:11.427
- I always hit the porch.
- Dad! Mom?

02:11.565 --> 02:13.055
Richard, there's
no need to shout.

02:13.200 --> 02:16.033
Oh, Howard, Richard has his
great sophomore debate today.

02:16.169 --> 02:17.193
Yeah.

02:17.337 --> 02:18.668
Let me give you
some advice, Richard.

02:18.805 --> 02:20.170
Oh, good. I need some.

02:20.307 --> 02:21.968
- Shave.
- Shave?

02:22.109 --> 02:24.009
Must have cost Nixon
a million votes.

02:24.144 --> 02:26.238
You thought he won that debate.

02:26.380 --> 02:28.075
Well, he did.
That's the point.

02:28.215 --> 02:30.343
He did.
He scored very well.

02:30.484 --> 02:33.317
But the next day, all I heard
was: "Nixon didn't shave."

02:33.453 --> 02:35.012
Well, he looked a little scuff y.

02:35.155 --> 02:36.350
Yeah. Boy, did he.

02:36.490 --> 02:38.754
All right, now,
about my campaign...

02:38.892 --> 02:40.189
-(Joanie groaning)
-(Richie groans)

02:40.327 --> 02:42.694
Oh, Mom, I feel really sick.

02:42.829 --> 02:43.990
Feel my forehead.

02:44.131 --> 02:47.157
Oh, Joanie, you cannot stay home
from school today.

02:47.300 --> 02:49.200
Oh, Mom, I'm sure it's the flu.

02:50.237 --> 02:52.035
A virus--
you know, that's worse.

02:52.172 --> 02:54.504
Malaria.

02:54.641 --> 02:58.202
<i>Joanie, a“ you have
is geometry-it's.</i>

02:58.345 --> 03:00.040
Why don't you just study?

03:00.180 --> 03:01.705
Well, anybody can study.

03:01.848 --> 03:04.180
I want malaria.

03:04.317 --> 03:06.251
I'll buy you a mosquito.

03:06.386 --> 03:07.717
All right, now...
now, sit down, please.

03:07.854 --> 03:10.186
I want to... I want to do
my speech for you, okay?

03:10.323 --> 03:13.054
Now, first thing that will
happen is: I'll be introduced.

03:13.193 --> 03:14.126
HOWARD:
Mm-hmm.

03:14.261 --> 03:16.320
"Richard J. Cunningham."

03:16.463 --> 03:18.488

03:27.941 --> 03:30.069
Hey, listen, the best
of good mornings to you, too,

03:30.210 --> 03:32.144
but applause ain't necessary,
you know.

03:33.480 --> 03:34.743
Hey, thanks, Mrs. C.

03:34.881 --> 03:36.576
Well, that's it.
I'm through. I'm finished.

03:36.717 --> 03:39.118
I'm not getting any help at all
on my election campaign.

03:39.252 --> 03:40.879
- FONZIE: I was thinking
about that, huh? -Yeah?

03:41.021 --> 03:43.888
Hey, hey, how's this
for a slogan, right?

03:44.024 --> 03:48.427
"Richie Cunningham... heyyy.

03:48.562 --> 03:51.259
The other guy, get out of here."

03:53.233 --> 03:56.225
Well, I'm not sure how that
would work on a bumper sticker.

03:56.369 --> 03:59.430
- Look, Richard, can we get on
with this, please? -Oh, sure.

03:59.573 --> 04:01.871
Arthur, Richard's just going to
let us hear his platform.

04:02.008 --> 04:03.669
- Hey, I'm all ears, Richie.
- Thanks.

04:03.810 --> 04:05.039
I'm all ears.

04:05.178 --> 04:07.272
Shoot!

04:07.414 --> 04:09.815
My fellow sophomores,

04:09.950 --> 04:13.215
point number one:

04:13.353 --> 04:17.813
UWM is administered
by a board of regents,

04:17.958 --> 04:22.019
average age 62 years old.

04:22.162 --> 04:25.029
Therefore, I have erected
the framework

04:25.165 --> 04:29.500
to place student representatives
on the dais of our ruling body.

04:29.636 --> 04:31.468
- Ah, that's terrific.
- That's great. -Very good.

04:31.605 --> 04:33.573
Oh, wait, wait. Fonz? Mom?

04:33.707 --> 04:35.766
- What's the matter?
- That's only my first point.

04:35.909 --> 04:38.276
I've got 21 more points
to my platform.

04:38.411 --> 04:40.937
- He's got 21 more points.
- JOANIE: 21?

04:42.549 --> 04:45.177
Point number two...

04:46.586 --> 04:49.681
<i>Point 22.</i>

04:52.025 --> 04:55.757
Restripe the students'
parking lot.

04:55.896 --> 04:59.355
Right now, we have
those straight lines,

04:59.499 --> 05:01.661
and you have to make
a very sharp turn

05:01.802 --> 05:03.395
to get into a space.

05:03.537 --> 05:08.236
I propose that we
angle those lines.

05:08.375 --> 05:11.606
I think he's losing them, Pots.

05:11.745 --> 05:13.736
- Potsie!
- Huh? What? Huh?

05:13.880 --> 05:18.477
I think everyone agrees
that angled parking spaces

05:18.618 --> 05:20.712
are a whole lot easier
to get into.

05:20.854 --> 05:25.655
Well, those are my
22 platform points.

05:25.792 --> 05:28.523
If elected, I promise
to do my very best

05:28.662 --> 05:31.632
to achieve each
and every one of them.

05:31.765 --> 05:32.732
Thank you.

05:32.866 --> 05:34.356
Let's hear it
for Richie Cunningham.

05:34.501 --> 05:36.401
Yeah, yeah, hear it
for Richie Cunningham.

05:36.536 --> 05:38.504
All right, all right.

05:38.638 --> 05:39.833
Yeah, yeah.

05:39.973 --> 05:41.600
- How'd I do?
- No more talk.

05:41.741 --> 05:43.903
- Just sit down.
- Sit down.

05:44.044 --> 05:46.843
That, of course, was our own
candidate, Richie Cunningham.

05:46.980 --> 05:48.379
Yeah.

05:48.515 --> 05:52.281
Now it's my duty to introduce
the other candidate,

05:52.419 --> 05:54.478
Mr. Fred Rollins.

05:54.621 --> 05:55.986
That's, uh, Collins.

05:56.122 --> 05:58.489
Oh, I'm sorry, Ted.

06:00.227 --> 06:01.717
My approach to this office

06:01.862 --> 06:04.388
is a lot simpler
than that of my worthy

06:04.531 --> 06:06.863
and somewhat long-winded
opponent.

06:08.168 --> 06:10.637
My platform has but two planks:

06:10.770 --> 06:13.796
shorter classes
and beer on campus.

06:13.940 --> 06:15.101
(cheering)

06:15.242 --> 06:17.176
Let's hear it for
our next president, Fred.

06:17.310 --> 06:18.505
We want Fred!

06:18.645 --> 06:20.113
CROWD (chanting):
We want Fred!

06:20.247 --> 06:22.614
We want Fred! We want Fred!

06:22.749 --> 06:26.379
We want Fred! We want Fred!
We want Fred!

06:26.519 --> 06:28.886
Hey, what kind
of debate is that?

06:29.022 --> 06:31.320
Where's my rebuttal?

06:33.994 --> 06:36.292
<i>MARION: Arthur, you want
some more veggies?</i>

06:36.429 --> 06:38.420
Yeah, I could take
another scoop there, Mrs. C.

06:38.565 --> 06:41.159
All right.
Peas, broccoli or yams?

06:41.301 --> 06:42.860
Yes, yes, yes.

06:43.003 --> 06:44.493
Okay.

06:44.638 --> 06:46.197
FONZIE: Thank you.
There you go, Rich.

06:46.339 --> 06:47.534
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

06:47.674 --> 06:49.733
FONZIE:
Thank you.

06:51.011 --> 06:53.343
Why don't I just
get you a shovel?

06:55.248 --> 06:56.682
<i>I'm sorry. I'm sorry.</i>

06:56.816 --> 06:58.614
You know, I've been thinking.

06:58.752 --> 07:01.119
I might add to my 22 points.

07:03.323 --> 07:04.449
Oh, no, no, listen to this.

07:04.591 --> 07:06.719
Just, you know,
maybe a couple of parties

07:06.860 --> 07:08.828
and a field trip to the brewery.

07:08.962 --> 07:11.624
Uh, free samples-- count me in.

07:11.765 --> 07:12.926
Joanie.

07:13.066 --> 07:15.364
Richard, just because
you've slipped a little

07:15.502 --> 07:17.630
doesn't mean you have
to work yourself into a panic.

07:17.771 --> 07:19.330
Now, you planned your campaign.

07:19.472 --> 07:21.600
You put in a lot of time
and effort on it.

07:21.741 --> 07:23.106
You should stick to your guns.

07:23.243 --> 07:24.677
But, Dad, we're running
neck and neck.

07:24.811 --> 07:26.074
I may even be losing.

07:26.212 --> 07:28.374
How can he possibly
keep those campaign promises?

07:28.515 --> 07:29.778
It's impossible.

07:29.916 --> 07:31.850
Tell me how he's going to keep
those campaign promises.

07:31.985 --> 07:33.953
I'll tell you something--
I tell you to slow down.

07:34.087 --> 07:35.748
-(doorbell rings)
- I'll get it.

07:35.889 --> 07:37.482
Well, if you do lose,

07:37.624 --> 07:39.922
at least you won't have
to resort to tricks and lies.

07:40.060 --> 07:41.289
FONZIE:
That's a good point.

07:41.428 --> 07:44.056
Hi, Howie. Smile.

07:45.966 --> 07:49.459
Okay, Rich,
your troubles are over.

07:49.602 --> 07:51.764
Do that again,
and yours will be beginning.

07:52.872 --> 07:57.105
Rich, Rich, we got it
all figured out.

07:57.243 --> 07:58.836
In your time of need,
we're falling back

07:58.979 --> 08:00.378
on a certain campaign ploy.

08:00.513 --> 08:01.776
Here. Hold her.

08:01.915 --> 08:03.610
Okay. Pucker up, Rich.

08:03.750 --> 08:05.718
I'm not kissing any babies.

08:05.852 --> 08:09.982
Oh, Mom, isn't it cute?

08:10.123 --> 08:12.217
Oh, it's a doll!

08:12.359 --> 08:14.384
Fellas, a doll?

08:14.527 --> 08:16.894
Mr. C., you know how hard
it is to rent a baby?

08:18.465 --> 08:21.332
When I was a baby, my father
rented me out all the time.

08:22.469 --> 08:23.959
Did he ask for a deposit?

08:25.739 --> 08:26.672
Okay, come on, Richie.

08:26.806 --> 08:27.796
- Get up.
- Yeah, come on.

08:27.941 --> 08:29.238
- Take the picture.
- Put the doll...

08:29.376 --> 08:31.174
- Okay, you move over there.
Pucker up. -Yeah.

08:31.311 --> 08:33.336
But don't squeeze her stomach
or else she'll wet.

08:34.381 --> 08:35.849
(groans)

08:36.850 --> 08:38.614
Guys, I got a lot to do.

08:38.751 --> 08:40.777
I got speeches tomorrow
with the glee club,

08:40.919 --> 08:43.389
the debating society,
the foreign students club--

08:43.523 --> 08:45.389
and they don't even
speak English.

08:45.525 --> 08:47.391
These guys are giving me
a doll that wets.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.757
All right. Okay, Rich,
we'll get you a real baby.

08:49.896 --> 08:51.625
We didn't know it meant
that much to you.

08:51.765 --> 08:53.255
Well, I don't want
any baby at all.

08:53.400 --> 08:54.925
No, I...
All right, give me the baby.

08:55.068 --> 08:56.126
- I'll try.
- Good. Good.

08:56.269 --> 08:57.532
Goo-goo...
No, it's ridiculous.

08:57.670 --> 08:58.796
Forget it.

08:58.938 --> 09:00.531
I don't know what I want to do.

09:00.673 --> 09:02.573
All right, it's conference time.
Let's go, Rich.

09:02.709 --> 09:04.473
Fonz, I got a lot
of speeches to write.

09:04.611 --> 09:06.477
I mean, what am I going to say
to the foreign students?

09:06.613 --> 09:07.910
- Ho!a?
- Hey, hey.

09:08.048 --> 09:09.573
Let me tell you something--
this political thing

09:09.716 --> 09:10.945
is making you wacko and crazy

09:11.084 --> 09:12.108
about everybody
that's around you.

09:12.252 --> 09:13.447
Understand?
Now, listen to me.

09:13.586 --> 09:14.849
I'm going to take you someplace

09:14.988 --> 09:16.979
that's going to calm you
right down, unwind.

09:17.123 --> 09:19.592
There's no way I'm gonna unwind
until this election's over.

09:19.726 --> 09:21.216
- No way.
- Right, I'll take bets on that.

09:21.361 --> 09:22.658
- Excuse us. We'll see you later.
- Huh?

09:22.796 --> 09:25.026
Huh. Whoa on this guy.

09:26.466 --> 09:31.336
Oh, Howard, it's been so long
since I held a little...

09:31.471 --> 09:33.200
Wouldn't it be nice?

09:33.339 --> 09:35.933
All right, sweetheart,
I'll get you a doll.

09:39.612 --> 09:41.137
FONZIE: Come on, Red,
you're <i>going</i> to get

09:41.281 --> 09:42.510
so relaxed.

09:42.649 --> 09:44.583
RICHIE: Fonz, I don't think
I ought to be here.

09:44.717 --> 09:45.809
FONZIE:
Hey, hey, I'm telling you,

09:45.952 --> 09:47.784
this is a legit massage parlor.

09:47.921 --> 09:49.582
Now, get in here with me.

09:49.722 --> 09:51.986
Get in here with me!

09:54.961 --> 09:57.430
Fonz, this just isn't
my kind of place, you know.

09:57.564 --> 09:59.532
I mean... well, it's drafty.

09:59.666 --> 10:01.361
I could catch a cold.

10:01.501 --> 10:03.128
At night, if I leave
my window open,

10:03.269 --> 10:04.600
even a little crack, I'm doomed.

10:04.737 --> 10:05.704
I mean, I am really doomed.

10:05.839 --> 10:06.965
I'll tell you
what you really are.

10:07.107 --> 10:08.074
You're tense is what you are.

10:08.208 --> 10:09.539
And a massage
is going to relax you.

10:09.676 --> 10:11.303
The best thing in the world
to relax you,

10:11.444 --> 10:13.242
because you are tense, Jack.

10:13.379 --> 10:14.437
Tense? Tense?

10:14.581 --> 10:15.707
I am not tense.

10:15.849 --> 10:17.010
When I entered
the political arena,

10:17.150 --> 10:18.345
I knew there would be pressures,

10:18.485 --> 10:20.510
but I am not tense;
I'm just shy.

10:20.653 --> 10:21.711
Hi there.

10:21.855 --> 10:23.448
Right back at you.

10:25.191 --> 10:27.091
Hey, Edie, this is my
good friend, Richie Cunningham.

10:27.227 --> 10:29.025
I want you to fix him up,
all right?

10:29.162 --> 10:30.459
He's cute.

10:30.597 --> 10:33.089
Well, the gods smiled on me.

10:35.335 --> 10:36.769
Take good care of him,
all right?

10:36.903 --> 10:39.201
I've got an order to go.

10:39.339 --> 10:40.738
Later.

10:40.874 --> 10:42.467
- EDIE: Bye.
- Whoa.

10:42.609 --> 10:43.838
Fonz?

10:43.977 --> 10:45.069
You ready?

10:45.211 --> 10:46.201
Ready?

10:46.346 --> 10:47.370
For your rubdown.

10:47.514 --> 10:48.572
<i>Rubdown'?</i>

10:48.715 --> 10:50.649
Do you repeat everything?

10:50.783 --> 10:52.751
Everything?

10:53.786 --> 10:55.083
Well, we better get started.

10:55.221 --> 10:57.053
Let's lie on the table.

10:57.190 --> 10:59.318
Okay, uh,
why don't you go first?

11:01.027 --> 11:02.791
- You are tense.
- Yeah.

11:02.929 --> 11:04.988
Now, this is the way it works.

11:05.131 --> 11:06.121
What?

11:06.266 --> 11:07.631
You lie on the table.

11:07.767 --> 11:08.791
I do the rubbing.

11:08.935 --> 11:10.061
Oh.

11:10.203 --> 11:11.136
Alcohol?

11:11.271 --> 11:12.705
Oh, no, thanks.

11:12.839 --> 11:15.308
Uh, I drink an occasional beer
from time to time...

11:15.441 --> 11:18.138
Nah. I meant rubbing alcohol.

11:18.278 --> 11:21.873
Oh. Uh, Edie, listen, uh,
I'll take a rain check, okay?

11:22.015 --> 11:25.007
Listen, I-l have to level
with you.

11:25.151 --> 11:29.054
I've never been
in a massage parlor before.

11:29.189 --> 11:30.850
- No kidding.
- No.

11:30.990 --> 11:33.516
You're cute.

11:33.660 --> 11:36.152
Off with the sheet, fella.

11:36.296 --> 11:37.593
I'd like to keep that on,
please.

11:37.730 --> 11:39.289
Tattoos.

11:39.432 --> 11:41.230
One drunken night
on the town, and...

11:41.367 --> 11:42.835
Well, you know how it is.

11:42.969 --> 11:44.528
Sure.

11:44.671 --> 11:47.436
Well...

11:47.574 --> 11:50.407
Ooh. (chuckles)

11:50.543 --> 11:52.773
(grunts)

11:52.912 --> 11:55.313
Yeah. How about
those Packers this year?

11:55.448 --> 11:56.779
Yeah.

11:56.916 --> 11:58.884
That Lombardi
really knows his stuff.

11:59.018 --> 12:00.042
Yeah.

12:00.186 --> 12:01.381
And Bart. Oh...

12:01.521 --> 12:03.080
I thought you'd like that.

12:03.223 --> 12:04.748
Uh, just a little lower there.

12:04.891 --> 12:07.053
- Ah...
- Yep.

12:08.995 --> 12:11.726
Cunningham, say cheese.

12:11.864 --> 12:13.389
This is gonna ruin you,
Cunningham.

12:13.533 --> 12:14.728
Ruin you!

12:14.867 --> 12:16.494
Enjoy yourself.

12:16.636 --> 12:18.502
Don't worry.

12:18.638 --> 12:20.629
Happens all the time.

12:22.475 --> 12:24.671
Ah...

12:29.816 --> 12:31.807
<i>II</i>

12:38.224 --> 12:40.215
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

12:40.360 --> 12:41.623
All right.

12:41.761 --> 12:42.956
How's the poll going, Pots?

12:43.096 --> 12:44.530
Let's see.
Question number one:

12:44.664 --> 12:46.655
Are you voting
in the upcoming election?

12:46.799 --> 12:48.267
Yes.

12:48.401 --> 12:51.200
Two: Have you decided
on a candidate?

12:51.337 --> 12:52.566
Undecided.

12:52.705 --> 12:54.173
Question number three:

12:54.307 --> 12:57.675
Will you go out with
Ralph Malph Saturday night?

12:59.512 --> 13:00.673
What's this word?

13:00.813 --> 13:02.872
Never mind, Pots.

13:05.618 --> 13:08.144
Well, fellas,
any trend developing?

13:08.288 --> 13:11.690
Yes. It looks like I'm
gonna be home Saturday night.

13:14.027 --> 13:15.495
I'm ruined.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.255
It's gonna be a scandal.

13:17.397 --> 13:19.058
It's gonna be my good name

13:19.198 --> 13:21.826
dragged through the muck
and the slime.

13:21.968 --> 13:23.265
Hey, Rich. What's new?

13:24.304 --> 13:25.669
What's new?

13:25.805 --> 13:28.240
Mullet and Collins took some
incriminating pictures of me

13:28.374 --> 13:29.773
down at Edie's Massage Parlor.

13:29.909 --> 13:30.808
That's what's new.

13:30.943 --> 13:32.877
Oh, Rich, how could you
do this to us?

13:33.012 --> 13:34.138
Me do? I didn't do.

13:34.280 --> 13:35.543
They must have followed me.

13:35.682 --> 13:37.446
- You went to a massage parlor?
- Yeah.

13:37.583 --> 13:39.073
And you didn't take
Potsie and me?

13:41.521 --> 13:43.615
Hey, hey, we work
our fingers to the bone,

13:43.756 --> 13:45.850
we arrange your speeches,
buy you a baby doll--

13:45.992 --> 13:47.585
eight bucks
out of our own pocket.

13:47.727 --> 13:49.855
What a slap in the face.

13:49.996 --> 13:51.191
Well, I'm sorry, Pots,

13:51.331 --> 13:52.958
but there's nothing
I could do about it.

13:53.099 --> 13:54.396
It doesn't matter now, anyway.

13:54.534 --> 13:56.229
No way I can win this election.

13:56.369 --> 13:59.498
Well, Rich, another budding
political career

13:59.639 --> 14:03.337
wrecked by the candidate's
wanton desires.

14:03.476 --> 14:06.343
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:08.114 --> 14:09.843
But what a way to go.

14:09.982 --> 14:11.143
(Richie groaning)

14:11.284 --> 14:12.581
RALPH:
All right.

14:12.719 --> 14:16.986
All right, all right.

14:17.123 --> 14:19.854
What if we could get our hands
on that film?

14:19.992 --> 14:20.857
Yeah.

14:20.993 --> 14:22.154
RICHIE:
Oh, brother, Ralph.

14:22.295 --> 14:23.524
- POTSIE: Hey.
- RICHIE: Wouldn't I love that?

14:23.663 --> 14:25.062
- All right, then let's
do it, Rich. -Yeah?

14:25.198 --> 14:26.495
They can't get it developed
before morning.

14:26.632 --> 14:28.498
And it's got to be
in Collins' room.

14:28.634 --> 14:30.864
Now, wait a minute.
This doesn't sound ethical.

14:31.003 --> 14:33.097
Hey, Al, what's ethical
about blackmail

14:33.239 --> 14:34.900
and public humiliation, huh?

14:35.041 --> 14:35.974
The man's right, Al.

14:36.109 --> 14:37.577
This humiliated man is right.

14:37.710 --> 14:39.303
Politics is dirty business,

14:39.445 --> 14:41.937
and you have to fight
fire with fire.

14:42.081 --> 14:43.105
- Let's do it.
- All right, come on.

14:43.249 --> 14:44.375
Now, we got to get organized.

14:44.517 --> 14:45.916
- We're going to need a ladder,
- Right.

14:46.052 --> 14:47.247
Rope, Fig Newtons.

14:47.387 --> 14:48.252
Fig Newtons?

14:48.388 --> 14:49.753
Oh, yeah, perfect for a robbery.

14:49.889 --> 14:52.551
They don't make any noise
when you eat 'em.

14:54.627 --> 14:58.791
Hey, guys, good luck
on the robbery.

14:58.931 --> 15:01.263
What am I saying?

15:03.002 --> 15:05.027
<i>FRED:
Like the man said,</i>

15:05.171 --> 15:06.935
one picture's worth
a thousand words.

15:07.073 --> 15:09.508
- You mean a thousand votes.
-(chuckling): Yeah.

15:09.642 --> 15:11.132
We better put this
in a safe place.

15:11.277 --> 15:13.268
Oh, right.

15:14.680 --> 15:16.307
First thing tomorrow,
we'll take this film

15:16.449 --> 15:17.780
down to the school paper,

15:17.917 --> 15:21.046
and then it's good-bye,
Mr. Cunningham.

15:21.187 --> 15:22.951
Safe and sound.

15:23.089 --> 15:25.080
Hey, we better go
downstairs to the party,

15:25.224 --> 15:26.749
or all the best chicks
are gonna be gone.

15:28.694 --> 15:29.855
Oh.

15:29.996 --> 15:31.862
After you, Mr. President.

15:31.998 --> 15:33.966
(Fred clears throat)

15:43.075 --> 15:44.338
- Pots?
- Yeah.

15:44.477 --> 15:45.706
Hold the window steady.

15:45.845 --> 15:47.574
Gotcha.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.382
How's that?

15:52.151 --> 15:53.710
Oh, anyone can do it that way.

15:53.853 --> 15:55.082
Get inside.

15:56.389 --> 15:57.720
All right, be careful, guys.

15:57.857 --> 15:59.086
Quiet. Quiet.

15:59.225 --> 16:00.454
Shh.

16:00.593 --> 16:02.584
Come on, come on, come on.

16:02.728 --> 16:04.457
You know, there's
something about this.

16:04.597 --> 16:05.894
I mean, this is wrong.

16:06.032 --> 16:07.261
You're right.

16:07.400 --> 16:09.892
You can't eat Fig Newtons
through a stocking.

16:11.237 --> 16:12.762
Right, Pots. Look at this.

16:12.905 --> 16:15.374
I've got a run, and it's
the first time I've worn it.

16:19.412 --> 16:21.244
What are you turning
the lights on for?

16:21.380 --> 16:23.280
Because Potsie forgot
the flashlight.

16:23.416 --> 16:24.815
Good point.
Can't steal in the dark.

16:24.951 --> 16:26.680
All right, let's get this
over with quick.

16:26.819 --> 16:28.150
- You're right. Okay.
- All right.

16:28.287 --> 16:31.154
Now, what we're looking for
is the camera or the film.

16:31.290 --> 16:33.816
- You got it?
- Not yet.

16:35.328 --> 16:37.194
Potsie, will you check the door?

16:37.330 --> 16:39.321
Yeah, all right.

16:40.366 --> 16:41.925
Door works.

16:43.202 --> 16:44.670
Close the door.

16:44.804 --> 16:46.067
- Lock the door.
- Lock the door.

16:46.205 --> 16:47.934
Close the door, open the door--
would you make up your mind?

16:48.074 --> 16:49.269
All right, Pots, you check
the right side

16:49.408 --> 16:50.876
-of the desk, okay?
- All right, got it, got it.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.671
I get the left side.

16:54.313 --> 16:56.338
- RALPH: Hey, Rich.
- Did you find it?

16:56.482 --> 16:59.281
No, but while we're here,
let's short-sheet the bed.

17:01.320 --> 17:03.379
My entire political career
is on the line,

17:03.523 --> 17:05.150
and you want to play jokes?

17:05.290 --> 17:07.487
(phone ringing)

17:07.627 --> 17:09.095
How'd anyone know we're here?

17:09.228 --> 17:10.957
All right, Shh.
I'll get it. I'll get it.

17:11.097 --> 17:11.996
Hurry up. All right.

17:12.131 --> 17:14.224
- Come on.
- Get up.

17:14.367 --> 17:16.631
(muffled):
Hello.

17:16.769 --> 17:19.829
Hello. Hello!

17:19.972 --> 17:21.166
Oh.

17:21.307 --> 17:23.275
All right, can you hear me now?

17:23.409 --> 17:25.343
Uh, no, he...

17:25.478 --> 17:26.604
What?

17:26.746 --> 17:28.305
- It was Teddy Roosevelt.
-(others shushing)

17:28.446 --> 17:29.642
oh. yeah?

17:29.782 --> 17:31.375
All right, bye.

17:31.517 --> 17:32.882
What was that?

17:33.019 --> 17:33.986
It was a quiz.

17:34.120 --> 17:35.417
I just won ten free
mambo lessons.

17:35.555 --> 17:37.455
- Oh!
- Come on.

17:41.093 --> 17:42.993
Hey, Malph.

17:43.129 --> 17:45.757
Ever hear of a magazine called
Sunshine and Health?

17:45.898 --> 17:47.957
Yeah, it's some kind
of nudist camp magazine.

17:48.100 --> 17:50.467
Nudist camp magazine?

17:50.603 --> 17:53.368
Oh! Oh!

17:53.506 --> 17:56.669
How would you like to see
a sweater on that?

18:03.082 --> 18:04.948
Hey, guys.

18:05.084 --> 18:06.051
Guys, the file cabinet.

18:06.185 --> 18:07.175
It's got to be...

18:07.320 --> 18:08.378
- Not bad.
- Yeah.

18:08.521 --> 18:09.955
Come on, let's check
the file cabinet.

18:10.089 --> 18:11.523
- Oh, right. Forget that.
- Oh, yeah. Mmm.

18:11.657 --> 18:13.785
- It's got to be in there, Rich.
- All right. All right.

18:13.926 --> 18:15.485
Oh. Oh, no, it's locked?

18:15.628 --> 18:17.221
- They're all locked.
-(footsteps approaching)

18:17.363 --> 18:18.489
Somebody's coming.

18:18.631 --> 18:19.962
- Hide. -Hide! Come on!
- Quick, quick!

18:20.099 --> 18:21.658
Oh! Come on!

18:32.278 --> 18:34.770
Come out, come out
from wherever you are.

18:34.914 --> 18:36.678
- Fonz!
- POTSIE: Fonzie.

18:36.816 --> 18:39.649
Fonz, how could you have
possibly known where we were?

18:39.785 --> 18:42.880
Well, Al told me
about the fraternity,

18:43.022 --> 18:46.287
and this is the, uh,
only window with a drill in it.

18:46.425 --> 18:47.756
Oh, good, Fonz.

18:47.893 --> 18:49.452
You saw my clue.

18:49.595 --> 18:51.222
Right.

18:52.431 --> 18:54.092
You found what you come for?

18:54.233 --> 18:55.428
Yeah, I think so, Fonz.

18:55.568 --> 18:57.366
It's in here,
only this is locked.

18:57.503 --> 18:58.664
You know what this is?

18:58.804 --> 18:59.794
A file cabinet.

18:59.939 --> 19:01.634
- No.
- POTSIE: Sure looks like one.

19:01.774 --> 19:03.572
Yes, but no.

19:03.709 --> 19:06.007
This is breaking
and entering, guys.

19:06.145 --> 19:08.011
(gasps, whimpers)

19:08.147 --> 19:11.048
Sure, now you go...
(mimics Ralph's whimper)

19:12.418 --> 19:14.250
At Arnold's, you were saying
fight fire with fire.

19:14.387 --> 19:16.185
- Hey, let me tell you
something, Rich. -Huh?

19:16.322 --> 19:18.450
- Like my old grandma
used to say... -Yeah?

19:18.591 --> 19:22.459
"Two wrongs definitely does not
a right make, honey."

19:23.763 --> 19:25.595
If that picture gets
into circulation,

19:25.731 --> 19:27.961
- I'm in big trouble, Fonz...
- Hey, let me tell you something.

19:28.100 --> 19:29.568
A president stealing don't make

19:29.702 --> 19:30.897
a good impression,
either, you know.

19:31.037 --> 19:32.471
- Oh...
- And if you do this, Rich,

19:32.605 --> 19:34.733
you'll never be able to look
at that cherubim face

19:34.874 --> 19:37.070
in the mirror again.

19:37.209 --> 19:39.337
Come on, Fonz, so he can wash
his face with his eyes closed.

19:39.478 --> 19:40.502
That's right.

19:45.051 --> 19:46.610
You got to live with it.

19:46.752 --> 19:48.720
POTSIE:
Okay, come on.

19:51.991 --> 19:53.686
- POTSIE: All right!
- RALPH: We did it!

19:53.826 --> 19:54.987
We got it. Oh, thank you.

19:55.127 --> 19:56.891
Hey, Rich, you see,
we got the film.

19:57.029 --> 19:58.190
- Yeah.
- That's terrific.

19:58.330 --> 20:00.230
- That's it. We got it.
- We got it.

20:00.366 --> 20:02.164
All right, all right,
let's get out of here.

20:02.301 --> 20:03.996
- Come on.
- Okay, let's go, guys.

20:07.339 --> 20:10.206
Wait a second, guys.

20:10.342 --> 20:12.140
Fonz, you don't want me
to do this.

20:13.646 --> 20:15.910
And I don't want to do it,
either.

20:16.048 --> 20:17.812
I'm very proud of you.

20:20.753 --> 20:22.346
Well, like you said,

20:22.488 --> 20:26.686
"Two wrongs definitely does not
a right make, honey."

20:26.826 --> 20:28.260
(pounding)

20:28.394 --> 20:29.691
All right,
let's get out of here.

20:29.829 --> 20:31.160
- Oh, yeah.
- Come on, Rich, let's go.

20:31.297 --> 20:32.287
- Okay.
- Come on, Malph.

20:32.431 --> 20:33.762
You guys go ahead.
I'm just gonna...

20:33.899 --> 20:35.799
I'll check the door.
<i>l-I'll</i> be right there.

20:35.935 --> 20:37.027
Hurry UP-

20:37.169 --> 20:39.297
Right. Right, Fonz, right.

20:44.744 --> 20:46.735
FONZIE:
Put it back, Malph.

20:46.879 --> 20:49.541
But, Fonz, naked volleyball.

20:49.682 --> 20:51.810
FONZIE:
Malph.

21:01.460 --> 21:03.155
<i>RICHIE: Dad, will you
just look at this?</i>

21:03.295 --> 21:05.821
My picture is smack dab on the
front page of the school paper.

21:05.965 --> 21:08.024
- Huh? You see it? -Richard,
it's gonna be all right

21:08.167 --> 21:11.159
just as soon as you explain
everything to the voters.

21:11.303 --> 21:13.362
Now, Richard, we know it was
an innocent thing, dear.

21:13.506 --> 21:14.940
It's too late for all that.

21:15.074 --> 21:16.200
Everybody's already voted.

21:16.342 --> 21:17.503
The polls are closed.

21:17.643 --> 21:19.475
Guess I could transfer schools.

21:19.612 --> 21:21.842
Eastern New Mexico,

21:21.981 --> 21:24.780
Yale, Siberia.

21:24.917 --> 21:26.976
Oh, Richard, not Siberia.

21:27.119 --> 21:29.451
You'll never get home
for Christmas.

21:30.790 --> 21:32.918
You know, this is
the biggest family scandal

21:33.058 --> 21:35.618
since Grandmother Kelp
and the handyman.

21:35.761 --> 21:37.786
MARION: That was just
a case of mistaken

21:37.930 --> 21:39.295
-identity, dear.
- Oh.

21:39.431 --> 21:41.661
That's not what
the handyman said in court.

21:41.801 --> 21:43.792
Joanie.

21:43.936 --> 21:45.665
Look, Richard, that photograph

21:45.805 --> 21:47.899
is going to be forgotten
in a few days.

21:48.040 --> 21:49.599
Scandals usually are.

21:49.742 --> 21:50.937
That's true, dear.

21:53.312 --> 21:55.804
Rich, I know it's not
your birthday.

21:55.948 --> 21:58.781
Autographed and framed for you.

22:00.452 --> 22:01.817
Oh, that's... that's nice, Fonz,

22:01.954 --> 22:04.013
but I think I've been
framed enough this week.

22:04.156 --> 22:05.646
(doorbell rings)

22:05.791 --> 22:07.725
I'll get it.

22:08.861 --> 22:09.794
All right, everybody.

22:09.929 --> 22:10.987
Hold onto your hats.

22:11.130 --> 22:12.359
I've got an announcement
to make.

22:12.498 --> 22:13.431
Richie won.

22:13.566 --> 22:14.692
I couldn't wait, Malph.

22:14.834 --> 22:17.201
- I won?
-(others exclaiming)

22:17.336 --> 22:19.464
- I won.
- I knew it!

22:19.605 --> 22:20.970
Rich, it wasn't even close.

22:21.106 --> 22:21.971
Congratulations.

22:22.107 --> 22:23.370
All right, well, you see that?

22:23.509 --> 22:25.739
The sophomore class
is interested in vital issues.

22:25.878 --> 22:28.176
Yeah, yeah, they want
massage parlors on campus.

22:30.015 --> 22:31.073
You mean I... I won

22:31.217 --> 22:32.582
because I was dressed
in a sheet?

22:32.718 --> 22:35.653
Oh, my brother a sex object.

22:35.788 --> 22:38.052
What difference
does it make how you won?

22:38.190 --> 22:41.057
Now you can make the student
government a better one.

22:41.193 --> 22:43.025
That's the important thing,
Richard.

22:43.162 --> 22:46.063
Hey, congrats, Mr. Prez.

22:46.198 --> 22:48.292
- Mr. Prez?
- FONZIE: That's right.

22:48.434 --> 22:50.562
- I won.
- HOWARD: Mm-hmm.

22:50.703 --> 22:51.727
"Morning, Mr. President."

22:51.871 --> 22:53.032
"How are you today,
Mr. President?"

22:53.172 --> 22:55.106
"Shine your shoes,
Mr. President?"

22:55.241 --> 22:57.573
(vocalizing "Hail to the Chief")

22:57.710 --> 22:58.905
(imitates roaring crowd)

22:59.044 --> 23:00.136
HOWARD:
Richard!

23:00.279 --> 23:02.748
Thank you. Thanks very much.

23:02.882 --> 23:05.010
Oh. Yeah.

23:05.150 --> 23:06.982
The president cordially
invites you

23:07.119 --> 23:10.578
to, uh, go to Arnold's with him
and have sodas.

23:10.723 --> 23:13.249
And the sodas
are on the president!

23:13.392 --> 23:14.291
HOWARD:
Oh.

23:14.426 --> 23:16.986
(all vocalizing
"Hail to the Chief")

23:34.413 --> 23:35.608
<i>RICHIE:
All right.</i>

23:35.748 --> 23:37.512
Good. I'll give you
Baltic for Boardwalk.

23:37.650 --> 23:40.415
- No, no, uh-uh.
- Come on, Richard.

23:40.552 --> 23:41.576
I'll tell you one thing,

23:41.720 --> 23:43.154
when you got
a Cunningham in power,

23:43.289 --> 23:45.155
you get action-- real action.

23:45.291 --> 23:49.319
Now, Richard, did you repaint
the parking lines, dear?

23:49.461 --> 23:52.055
Well, not yet, but I sent
a letter to the board of regents

23:52.197 --> 23:53.926
that outlines every one
of my 22 points.

23:54.066 --> 23:55.397
Oh, condensed, of course.

23:55.534 --> 23:56.933
Well, I'm very proud
of you, Richard,

23:57.069 --> 23:58.264
especially the way
you followed up

23:58.404 --> 24:00.668
on your campaign promises.

24:00.806 --> 24:02.399
You may go down in history.

24:02.541 --> 24:03.702
-(phone ringing)
- Move that for me, will you?

24:03.842 --> 24:05.810
RICHIE:
Oh, yeah.

24:05.945 --> 24:08.346
Oh, you just went to jail, Dad.

24:08.480 --> 24:09.709
Thanks.

24:09.848 --> 24:11.247
Hello.

24:11.383 --> 24:12.714
Yes.

24:12.851 --> 24:14.751
Yes, he is.
Just a moment, please.

24:14.887 --> 24:16.082
- Richard.
- Huh?

24:16.221 --> 24:18.155
It's one of the members
of the board of regents.

24:18.290 --> 24:19.951
He'd like to talk to you.

24:20.092 --> 24:21.719
- The board of regents?
- Mm-hmm.

24:21.860 --> 24:23.555
- Calling me at home, huh?
- Yeah.

24:23.696 --> 24:25.755
Probably wants to talk
about some of the issues.

24:25.898 --> 24:27.491
Probably.

24:27.633 --> 24:31.592
Hello. Sophomore Class President
Cunningham here, sir.

24:31.737 --> 24:33.466
Yes, sir.

24:33.605 --> 24:35.232
Uh-huh.

24:35.374 --> 24:37.103
Well...

24:37.242 --> 24:38.403
(sighs)

24:38.544 --> 24:39.978
It's up one flight.

24:40.112 --> 24:41.602
Ask for Edie.

24:45.584 --> 24:47.143
Ye... uh... yes, sir.

24:47.286 --> 24:48.583
Yeah, sure.

24:48.721 --> 24:51.053
You can, uh, tell her
Richie sent you.

24:51.190 --> 24:52.954
