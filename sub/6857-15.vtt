00:16.579 --> 00:18.143
<i>War on many fronts!</i>

00:18.178 --> 00:20.937
<i>While battles are fought by
Clones in the field.</i>

00:21.468 --> 00:24.188
<i>A different war is waged on
the Galactic Senate.</i>

00:24.318 --> 00:25.791
<i>As heavy loses add up</i>

00:25.922 --> 00:28.462
<i>a group of senators lead by
Halle Burtoni of Kamino</i>

00:28.849 --> 00:31.474
<i>propose an escalation of
troop production</i>

00:31.605 --> 00:36.497
<i>Senator Padme Amidala, recognizing that
more troops will only prolong the fighting.</i>

00:36.628 --> 00:40.898
<i>Works tirelessly with her allies to
introduce a bill to cut military spending</i>

00:41.028 --> 00:44.107
<i>and stop the creation of
more clone troopers.</i>

00:48.237 --> 00:51.493
Yes of course Senator.
Thank you for telling me yourself.

00:51.624 --> 00:53.296
I completely understand.

00:54.373 --> 00:56.472
Did we loose someone else's vote?

00:56.716 --> 00:59.802
Senator Stank is worried
about Republic opinion.

01:00.152 --> 01:03.291
But he wants us to know
how very sorry he is.

01:03.422 --> 01:05.248
Sorry doesn't get us votes.

01:05.602 --> 01:08.454
We will get votes,
when in your speech,

01:08.585 --> 01:12.442
you will convince people to stand
up for what they know is right.

01:12.582 --> 01:14.416
I hope you're right, Uncle.

01:14.547 --> 01:17.665
You have been doing an amazing job,
rallying votes to our side.

01:17.795 --> 01:19.756
Choose cool Senator Farr.

01:24.827 --> 01:29.588
Perhaps, I am the most
influential man on Rodia, Lolo.

01:30.427 --> 01:32.771
But after all the
mistakes I've made,

01:33.290 --> 01:34.202
peace...

01:34.827 --> 01:37.087
is what matters to me now.

01:37.217 --> 01:38.469
Senator Amidala,

01:38.600 --> 01:41.258
they're ready for your
speech now. It's time.

01:42.902 --> 01:46.125
We will see you in the chamber,
Senator Amidala.

01:46.256 --> 01:47.600
Good luck, Padme.

01:51.703 --> 01:53.675
It is quite exciting.

01:53.806 --> 01:56.518
It isn't exactly the
word I would use.

01:56.744 --> 01:59.183
I think terrifying
is more appropriate.

01:59.544 --> 02:01.757
Pay her no mind Senator Organa...

02:02.417 --> 02:05.843
Even as a girl,
Padme down played her strengths

02:06.217 --> 02:09.042
helps to maintain the
element of surprise.

02:10.267 --> 02:13.459
I learned it from you.
See you inside Senators.

02:18.283 --> 02:21.521
<i>The creation of more warriors
will not end this war</i>

02:22.009 --> 02:25.826
<i>the financial cost alone will bankrupt
and cripple the Republic.</i>

02:25.957 --> 02:28.149
<i>By adding more clones
to the conflict,</i>

02:28.280 --> 02:32.431
<i>we're only escalating the destruction,
not winning the war.</i>

02:32.561 --> 02:37.508
<i>Which is why we must vote for this
resolution to promote more diplomacy,</i>

02:37.726 --> 02:41.501
<i>and to bring an end to this killing,
and hatred.</i>

03:06.943 --> 03:09.117
That was quite a moment, my dear.

03:09.541 --> 03:11.619
Thank you, Senator Deechi.

03:12.521 --> 03:14.571
Oh, it wasn't a compliment.

03:16.568 --> 03:18.848
You shouldn't make
speeches like that.

03:18.979 --> 03:20.905
It's unpatriotic.

03:21.159 --> 03:25.033
The only thing I find unpatriotic
is your war mongering.

03:38.634 --> 03:39.472
Truly,

03:39.603 --> 03:41.380
you have turned the tide.

03:43.862 --> 03:45.959
My dear, you were brilliant.

03:45.994 --> 03:47.609
Thank you. But perhaps,

03:47.740 --> 03:51.586
we should wait to we actually win the
vote before we make a victory speech.

03:51.717 --> 03:53.696
What a novel idea.

03:55.457 --> 03:56.772
Imagine that.

03:57.452 --> 04:01.576
Amadala's actually making
sense for once in her life.

04:02.435 --> 04:06.030
Senator Burtoni.
This is a private conversation.

04:06.266 --> 04:10.360
Private conversation or
separatist conspiracy?

04:10.954 --> 04:14.008
How dare you?
We're not pro separatist.

04:14.139 --> 04:15.593
We want to end the war.

04:15.594 --> 04:19.140
Committing more troops to the front
lines will not allow diplomacy to resume

04:19.689 --> 04:23.115
diplomacy failed the
Republic long ago.

04:23.369 --> 04:24.992
Senators, please.

04:25.299 --> 04:26.784
Senator Burtoni,

04:27.154 --> 04:29.802
the Kaminoans might have
bartered their creation

04:29.933 --> 04:32.852
of the clones into a seat
in the Galactic Senate.

04:32.983 --> 04:35.752
But this is not
give you free reign.

04:36.568 --> 04:38.880
Thank you for visiting, Senator.

04:39.011 --> 04:43.494
We would like to continue our
meeting now... if you don't mind.

04:43.625 --> 04:46.971
Enjoy your moment in the
spot light Senators.

04:47.248 --> 04:49.645
This war will not end soon.

04:56.739 --> 05:00.313
Well, we must be doing something right
if we've rattled Senator Burtoni.

05:00.444 --> 05:04.586
What matters is that we've made great
strides in our fight against this bill.

05:04.717 --> 05:07.896
I know you've done a wonderful
job leading the effort

05:07.931 --> 05:10.083
I'm just trying to do what's right.

05:10.401 --> 05:14.335
I only wish I'd tried doing
that a long time ago.

05:14.466 --> 05:16.398
You're doing it now.

05:16.695 --> 05:19.410
To victory and an end to this war.

05:20.788 --> 05:22.146
To victories.

05:24.381 --> 05:25.525
My heart,

05:26.628 --> 05:28.156
I can't breathe.

05:28.286 --> 05:30.138
Uncle? What is it?

05:32.130 --> 05:33.764
Ono! It's his heart!

05:33.894 --> 05:35.874
Please! Someone get help!

05:40.855 --> 05:45.192
And we are all aware that
Ono Condo was a flawed man.

05:45.945 --> 05:49.211
He knew better than anyone
of his own mistakes.

05:49.342 --> 05:52.275
But he never compromised
his principals.

05:52.498 --> 05:55.869
And what he did,
he did for his people.

05:56.453 --> 05:58.797
Their needs always came first.

06:11.441 --> 06:14.495
Senator, if you need anything.

06:14.626 --> 06:17.603
What we need is to get
his resolution passed.

06:38.653 --> 06:39.977
He was my mentor.

06:40.328 --> 06:43.756
I don't know how to carry
on without him guiding me.

06:44.149 --> 06:46.991
I know. No one could
ever take his place.

06:47.121 --> 06:50.829
Excuse me. Chancellor Palpatine has
summoned both of you to his chambers.

07:00.958 --> 07:02.294
What's happened?

07:02.425 --> 07:06.441
I'm afraid my friends that Lieutenant
Divo here has some questions

07:06.572 --> 07:08.190
about Senator Farr.

07:09.229 --> 07:12.454
Do you know of anyone who...

07:12.853 --> 07:15.614
how to put this...

07:16.515 --> 07:18.413
hated Senator Farr?

07:18.752 --> 07:20.237
Enough to kill him?

07:20.821 --> 07:21.658
What?

07:26.844 --> 07:30.725
I'll need to find out who
wanted to hurt Senator Farr...

07:31.025 --> 07:33.454
Actually kill him would
be more accurate.

07:33.697 --> 07:35.393
What with him being dead.

07:35.734 --> 07:37.189
No one wanted him dead

07:37.608 --> 07:39.313
Everyone loved him

07:39.524 --> 07:40.696
Well, that's obviously

07:40.697 --> 07:44.143
not true or I wouldn't be here,
and he would.

07:44.144 --> 07:48.476
Lieutenant, even Ono's
political enemies respected him

07:49.361 --> 07:51.161
we need time to deal
with this situation

07:51.162 --> 07:57.128
Time, time, there's no time. A murderers
on the lose and it's my job to find him.

07:57.939 --> 08:00.090
Ahem

08:00.091 --> 08:02.292
what makes you think it was murder

08:03.101 --> 08:04.169
poison of course

08:05.049 --> 08:06.988
the politician's preferred method

08:07.830 --> 08:09.822
found a chemical in his blood stream,
killed him right away.

08:09.823 --> 08:11.262
It's an obvious case.

08:11.263 --> 08:13.398
Politicians always
have something to hide.

08:13.399 --> 08:14.929
And it always come
back to haunt them.

08:16.769 --> 08:18.275
Am I right?

08:20.757 --> 08:24.092
Look who I am asking a
room full of politicians

08:25.209 --> 08:30.244
so, one of Farr's secrets
must have resurfaced

08:30.245 --> 08:31.960
Ono had no secrets

08:32.443 --> 08:33.481
that's not it

08:34.063 --> 08:35.015
perhaps

08:35.558 --> 08:37.991
someone was upset about the Clone
troop bill currently on the floor.

08:37.991 --> 08:40.139
It's very controversial

08:40.140 --> 08:43.760
thank you senator Amadala, is it?

08:43.760 --> 08:45.932
But I already have my theory

08:45.933 --> 08:48.238
and I'll follow my hunch
if you don't mind.

08:48.239 --> 08:51.891
After all I am the inspector.
You are the senator.

08:51.892 --> 08:53.725
So I'll handle the inspecting

08:53.726 --> 08:56.083
and you can stick to the 'senating'.

09:00.049 --> 09:00.970
Good day.

09:03.796 --> 09:04.627
Murder.

09:04.628 --> 09:07.477
It's inconceivable.

09:09.457 --> 09:13.193
Who would wish Ono Conda harm?
What if it's the BIM.

09:13.194 --> 09:15.027
What if we're all being targeted.

09:15.028 --> 09:16.995
Speculation gets us no where

09:16.996 --> 09:20.821
there is work to do, we should
double our efforts on the vote

09:20.822 --> 09:22.852
it'll be even harder with Ono gone.

09:22.853 --> 09:27.743
- No, no, we should delay the vote.
- but, why?

09:27.778 --> 09:32.197
No one will give the vote their full
attention until they know what's happened to Ono.

09:32.198 --> 09:33.744
Well,

09:33.745 --> 09:36.140
maybe I can put a
motion on the floor.

09:36.141 --> 09:39.036
I don't think anyone will
object given the circumstances.

09:39.037 --> 09:40.112
Good.

09:40.113 --> 09:43.756
And we'll have time to
conduct our own investigation.

09:43.757 --> 09:47.222
Detective Diva specifically
asked us not to interfere.

09:47.475 --> 09:50.864
Well he didn't exactly
inspire confidence, did he?

09:50.865 --> 09:53.318
He didn't know Ono.

09:53.319 --> 09:54.581
We did.

09:54.582 --> 09:57.136
We'll have a far easier
time looking into this

09:57.137 --> 09:59.867
than detective Divo will.

10:00.500 --> 10:02.606
Running around could
disrupt our coalition.

10:02.607 --> 10:04.827
Yet you still seem determined
to see this through.

10:04.828 --> 10:07.045
Indeed I am.

10:07.046 --> 10:10.499
And I don't supposed you'd
considering bringing

10:10.500 --> 10:12.359
- ...Captain Tyfo along with you?
- No.

10:12.360 --> 10:14.431
I'd rather do this quietly.

10:14.432 --> 10:18.511
Then perhaps sentator Agama,
you should accmopany her.

10:18.512 --> 10:21.036
I think that's an excellent idea.

10:21.037 --> 10:22.654
I don't need a guardian.

10:22.655 --> 10:24.815
Of course not my dear.

10:24.816 --> 10:26.741
Think of it as precautionary.

10:26.742 --> 10:28.935
Don't worry,
I won't get yin your way.

10:28.936 --> 10:31.126
Very well, I don't
have any objections.

10:31.127 --> 10:33.772
And I know exactly where to start.

10:45.171 --> 10:50.070
You're suggesting one of
us killed Ono Conda Farr.

10:50.071 --> 10:53.217
- How delightful.
- I don't find any of this amusing.

10:53.218 --> 10:57.409
- Neither do I.
- Every time Ono opened his befuddled mouth,

10:57.444 --> 11:01.100
it gave us another quote to
use in our fund-raising.

11:01.101 --> 11:04.440
Why would we kill our
best source of income.

11:04.442 --> 11:07.778
You both opposed Ono's
ideas in the senate.

11:07.779 --> 11:09.572
With enough at stake.

11:09.573 --> 11:13.229
Maybe you decided to
silence his voice, for good.

11:13.230 --> 11:16.442
Ono conda and I,
were often at odds,

11:16.443 --> 11:19.012
but I respected him.

11:19.013 --> 11:22.315
- I respected him greatly.
- For the record,

11:22.316 --> 11:26.406
I had no respect for
Ono Conda what so ever.

11:26.407 --> 11:32.630
Ono had a secret meeting at the docks on
the direct Major, the night before he died.

11:32.631 --> 11:35.855
And you just happened to
know about this meeting how?

11:35.856 --> 11:38.967
Oh, I was having Ono followed.

11:38.968 --> 11:41.824
Just because I respected Ono,

11:41.825 --> 11:45.643
doesn't mean I wasn't trying
to get dirt on him.

11:45.678 --> 11:46.993
Of course.

11:46.994 --> 11:49.827
The point is...
a clandestined off the

11:49.828 --> 11:52.658
books meeting under
cover of darkness.

11:52.659 --> 11:56.735
Perhaps that location
holds some clue.

11:56.736 --> 12:00.824
Fine, I will go look.
But whatever we find,

12:00.825 --> 12:03.310
I'll have more questions
for both of you.

12:17.463 --> 12:20.460
Have I said that I think we're
very far out of our element here?

12:20.461 --> 12:24.506
Yes, ***, I believed you've
mentioned once or twice.

12:40.459 --> 12:44.640
You're using this investigation to bury
your grief, might not be the best way to...

12:44.641 --> 12:46.957
I'm not.

12:48.672 --> 12:51.147
Then why can't you just
leave it to Lieutenant Divo?

13:03.281 --> 13:05.228
Padme!

13:46.350 --> 13:48.988
Watch out!

14:35.274 --> 14:40.071
Senator Amadala, is it possible
you might be going deaf?

14:40.072 --> 14:41.451
Lieutenant?

14:41.452 --> 14:45.424
Because when I said I didn't want you
to interfere with my investigation.

14:45.425 --> 14:49.021
I can only assume
you didn't hear me.

14:49.022 --> 14:51.549
I had some information about
a lead here at the docks.

14:51.550 --> 14:56.602
Which you naturally brought to me straight
away so I could investigate... only...

14:56.603 --> 15:00.133
no wait.. you did exactly
the opposite of that.

15:00.134 --> 15:02.365
There are rules, senator.

15:02.367 --> 15:04.213
My friend was murdered.

15:04.214 --> 15:06.381
I don't care about rules.

15:07.595 --> 15:09.928
Don't care about rules?

15:09.929 --> 15:12.151
My dear, without rules

15:12.152 --> 15:14.721
there's only chaos.
Everyone must care about rules.

15:14.722 --> 15:16.257
We know that.

15:16.258 --> 15:19.158
But now you've alerted the
killer that you're on to him.

15:19.159 --> 15:21.729
And my investigation
is that much harder.

15:21.730 --> 15:24.294
Do you have any idea how many
reports I'll have to file now.

15:24.295 --> 15:26.776
We alerted the killer.

15:26.777 --> 15:28.529
Yes, that is what I'm saying.

15:28.530 --> 15:31.214
What if we were sent
here on purpose.

15:31.215 --> 15:32.453
To the docks?

15:32.454 --> 15:33.399
Yes!

15:33.400 --> 15:35.441
What if this was all a setup.

15:35.442 --> 15:39.511
What if Dechee sent us here
just so he could kill us.

15:39.512 --> 15:41.356
If we hurry we might
still be able to

15:41.357 --> 15:42.706
catch Dechee before
he leaves the senate.

15:42.707 --> 15:43.528
Agreed!

15:44.698 --> 15:46.845
But wait, I'm still investigating.

15:46.846 --> 15:49.126
This is still an active crime scene,

15:49.127 --> 15:51.288
you can't... Oh, fine.

15:56.569 --> 15:59.187
Senator Dechee,
I'm sure you're surprised

15:59.188 --> 16:02.603
to see me, after what you.
Oh! he's dead.

16:02.604 --> 16:03.814
He's been stabbed.

16:03.815 --> 16:07.716
This is definitely going
to require another report.

16:16.034 --> 16:19.375
The killer is obviously
targeting the leadership.

16:19.376 --> 16:22.032
You must stay here
under my protection.

16:22.033 --> 16:25.053
Why? so the keeler can
take us all out at once?

16:25.055 --> 16:27.278
Oh, that's preposterous.

16:27.279 --> 16:30.022
Even if the killer did
get through my security,

16:30.023 --> 16:32.728
it's very unlikely that all
of you would end up dead.

16:32.729 --> 16:35.213
We are far to easy a
target sitting here.

16:35.214 --> 16:36.521
I am leaving.

16:36.522 --> 16:39.393
No you can't leave Lolo. I think...

16:39.394 --> 16:42.386
in this instance,
the Inspector is right.

16:44.168 --> 16:44.964
Out of my way.

16:47.679 --> 16:51.322
Who else knew you
were going to the docks.

16:51.323 --> 16:56.224
Just Senator Bertoni. She was the
only other one in the room with us.

16:56.225 --> 16:57.784
Bertoni, eh?

17:06.105 --> 17:08.434
Sir, Senator Bertoni is not here.

17:08.435 --> 17:09.868
Ah!

17:09.869 --> 17:12.300
Looks like that long
necked Kaminoan

17:12.300 --> 17:13.590
has flown the coop.

17:17.374 --> 17:19.165
It's been a difficult time.

17:19.166 --> 17:21.164
You've handled yourself well.

17:21.165 --> 17:22.483
I had to try.

17:22.483 --> 17:25.137
Ono believed if you see injustice,

17:25.137 --> 17:27.483
you can't wait for
someone else to fix it.

17:27.483 --> 17:30.253
You must stand up and get involved.

17:30.254 --> 17:31.335
He did.

17:32.087 --> 17:35.809
Help, I have been attacked.

17:35.810 --> 17:37.236
She's over there.

17:37.237 --> 17:39.093
She tried to kill me.

17:39.094 --> 17:40.373
What happened?

17:40.374 --> 17:42.004
Senator Bertoni.

17:42.005 --> 17:43.283
She jumped me.

17:43.284 --> 17:46.239
She's in the east
wing corridor. Hurry!

17:46.240 --> 17:47.378
Guards go.

17:53.747 --> 17:55.028
You're insane.

17:55.029 --> 17:57.301
I didn't kill anyone.

17:57.336 --> 18:01.443
Last thing I remember,
I was walking to my office.

18:01.444 --> 18:03.685
Then I woke up here.

18:03.686 --> 18:06.715
Senator Lolo has a
very different story.

18:06.716 --> 18:08.537
She says you attacked her.

18:08.564 --> 18:09.380
Attacked her?

18:09.989 --> 18:10.606
Lolo?

18:13.628 --> 18:16.002
If I ever attack someone

18:16.303 --> 18:20.335
I hope it will be someone
mildly important.

18:20.336 --> 18:23.041
Someone like Senator Farr?

18:23.042 --> 18:25.500
Ono was a harmless bug.

18:25.501 --> 18:27.986
I wouldn't bother killing him.

18:27.987 --> 18:30.086
And Dechee was my ally.

18:30.287 --> 18:32.630
I've been thinking about how you

18:32.631 --> 18:34.973
were in Senator Amadala's office

18:34.974 --> 18:36.706
right before Farr died.

18:36.707 --> 18:38.800
So what?

18:38.801 --> 18:42.007
And I've been thinking about
how you were in Dechee's

18:42.008 --> 18:44.472
office to hear about the
meeting at the docks.

18:44.473 --> 18:47.629
A meeting I think
Farr has with you.

18:47.630 --> 18:51.428
It wasn't me. You have no proof.

18:54.426 --> 18:56.060
No? I have this.

18:56.061 --> 18:58.266
I ordered an extensive forensic

18:58.267 --> 19:00.276
report on Farr as soon as he died.

19:00.277 --> 19:04.296
The poison which killed Farr
only affected Rodian blood.

19:04.297 --> 19:07.467
And it was developed
by Kaminoan scientists.

19:07.468 --> 19:10.110
But... that's...

19:10.111 --> 19:11.600
I didn't kill him.

19:11.635 --> 19:13.949
You're Kaminoan.
You had access to the poison.

19:13.984 --> 19:16.263
That's motive, means,
and opportunity. Guards!

19:20.923 --> 19:23.144
But the scan must be wrong.

19:23.145 --> 19:25.145
If the poison was
in all our drinks.

19:25.146 --> 19:27.518
Lolo would have died too.

19:27.519 --> 19:28.436
What?

19:28.437 --> 19:31.220
She's Rodian. She'd
have been poisoned too.

19:31.221 --> 19:33.822
Unless she didn't drink.

19:34.355 --> 19:37.005
But you drank, right Lolo?

19:38.280 --> 19:39.368
Lolo,

19:40.077 --> 19:41.396
you didn't drink.

19:41.397 --> 19:42.426
Did you?

19:42.634 --> 19:46.054
You're right, I should
have pretended to drink.

19:46.055 --> 19:50.092
Alright, You're coming with me,
for insurance.

19:52.464 --> 19:54.134
Why did you kill Ono?

19:54.135 --> 19:56.687
He brought war to my planet.

19:57.206 --> 19:59.759
No, he made a mistake, Lolo.

19:59.760 --> 20:04.303
Which everyone seemed to forget,
including you. I didn't.

20:04.304 --> 20:08.213
Did you honestly think he had
the moral right to lead us?

20:08.215 --> 20:09.617
After he betrayed us?

20:09.618 --> 20:11.305
He was sorry!

20:11.306 --> 20:13.050
He was weak!

20:14.408 --> 20:16.979
We needed someone of strength
to stand against this war.

20:17.361 --> 20:19.004
I tried to scare him at the docks.

20:19.005 --> 20:21.095
But he wouldn't go away,
so I removed him.

20:23.385 --> 20:24.732
And then I heard Dechee
heard about the meeting.

20:24.733 --> 20:26.079
He had to go too.

20:26.080 --> 20:29.508
Halt! Put down your weapon.

20:47.786 --> 20:49.637
With the final votes tallied.

20:50.892 --> 20:52.504
Let it be known that
the motion to stop the

20:52.506 --> 20:55.725
the creation of more
clone troops has failed.

20:56.661 --> 20:59.406
And the continued manufacturing
of clone troopers

20:59.407 --> 21:02.296
shall proceed as scheduled

21:11.875 --> 21:13.357
After all that.

21:13.358 --> 21:14.552
We lost.

21:14.553 --> 21:17.928
I know this decision
was most unexpected.

21:17.929 --> 21:20.855
I myself don't support it, but,

21:20.856 --> 21:23.112
democracy must stand.

21:23.551 --> 21:26.403
Of course, you were
right chancellor.

21:26.404 --> 21:31.196
Actually, given recent events
perhaps it is for the best.

21:31.197 --> 21:32.918
How can we justify

21:32.919 --> 21:35.776
fortifying our security
here in the senate.

21:35.777 --> 21:39.371
If we don't also provide
reenforcement on the front lines.

21:41.377 --> 21:41.988
You see,

21:41.989 --> 21:45.082
the victory of the
clone army, for now,

21:45.083 --> 21:48.666
is the only thing that
can lead us to peace.
