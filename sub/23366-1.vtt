01:25.209 --> 01:27.476
Careful Samantha.
You nearly knocked me down.

01:27.478 --> 01:28.877
Samantha, what do you say?

01:28.879 --> 01:31.047
Excuse me, Sister Jean.
I'm sorry.

01:33.049 --> 01:34.852
- Aw.
- Sister Alejandra.

01:35.052 --> 01:38.053
My doofy brother says girls
can't do what boys can do,

01:38.055 --> 01:40.690
- because we're weak.
- Nonsense.

01:41.091 --> 01:43.725
You can do and be anything
you want when you grow up.

01:43.727 --> 01:45.594
Even President
of our great country.

01:45.596 --> 01:47.496
Don't you forget that.

01:47.498 --> 01:49.264
I wanna be
like Father John and hold mass

01:49.266 --> 01:52.767
and serve bread and wine
and communion when I grow up.

01:52.769 --> 01:54.803
Well,
that would be wonderful...

01:54.805 --> 01:56.773
Or, Samantha,
you could be a Sister, like me.

01:57.573 --> 02:00.911
And teach in a beautiful school
or a big hospital.

02:01.511 --> 02:02.913
Or you can work with the poor.

02:03.112 --> 02:05.081
But you can never be a priest.

02:05.915 --> 02:07.282
Let's go, children.

02:13.089 --> 02:14.124
Let's go.

02:41.751 --> 02:42.987
Who the hell is Sasha?

02:45.923 --> 02:47.091
You heard me.

02:47.857 --> 02:49.758
Okay. So, you're just
gonna ignore me?

02:49.760 --> 02:51.325
Why are you searching
through my phone?

02:51.327 --> 02:53.594
Do not answer my question
with another question.

02:53.596 --> 02:54.929
That's the kind of thing
that makes me think

02:54.931 --> 02:55.899
I can't trust you.

02:56.767 --> 02:58.769
Do not flip this on me.
Who is she?

02:59.202 --> 03:02.236
She's just some chick.
I can't control who texts me.

03:02.238 --> 03:03.804
- Some chick?
- Mm-hmm.

03:03.806 --> 03:05.640
Well, 'some chick' said

03:05.642 --> 03:07.207
that y'all were gonna hang out
tonight.

03:07.209 --> 03:08.912
Well, how's that possible
if I'm gonna be with you?

03:10.047 --> 03:11.813
So, why don't you go buy

03:11.815 --> 03:13.684
the sexiest little black dress
you can find.

03:15.619 --> 03:17.618
You think you can buy me,
don't you?

03:17.620 --> 03:18.755
It's working, innit?

03:20.791 --> 03:21.726
No!

03:24.126 --> 03:25.762
Kind of.

03:25.963 --> 03:28.095
Help me, Father,
with this challenge.

03:28.097 --> 03:29.730
I know I'm called
to guide Your people

03:29.732 --> 03:31.366
and to do Your holy will.

03:31.368 --> 03:33.735
Help me, Father,
with this challenge.

03:33.737 --> 03:35.302
I know I'm called
to guide Your people

03:35.304 --> 03:37.941
and to do Your holy will. Amen.

03:41.345 --> 03:42.647
Good day, Father John.

03:42.845 --> 03:45.315
Sister Alejandra.
We need to talk.

03:46.048 --> 03:47.050
Yes, Father.

03:54.224 --> 03:56.057
Once again,

03:56.059 --> 03:57.725
I have word that you're speaking
with the young girls

03:57.727 --> 03:59.361
about women going into
the priesthood.

03:59.363 --> 04:01.566
- Father John...
- And worst of all,

04:01.898 --> 04:04.199
you yourself have applied
to the seminary

04:04.201 --> 04:05.903
to study for the priesthood.

04:06.168 --> 04:08.805
Now, what kind of an example
are you setting for these girls?

04:09.006 --> 04:11.071
Father, I wanna do what you do.

04:11.073 --> 04:13.743
I wish to bring the word
of Jesus Christ to His people.

04:14.143 --> 04:15.278
You already do.

04:15.745 --> 04:17.615
I do not, Father.
You know I don't.

04:17.880 --> 04:19.714
In your own way, yes.

04:19.716 --> 04:21.151
It's not enough, Father.

04:21.385 --> 04:24.855
I pray and pray
and the message is the same.

04:25.288 --> 04:28.159
I believe in my heart
that Jesus wants me to minister.

04:28.892 --> 04:30.724
That he wants me
to become a priest.

04:30.726 --> 04:31.825
It is my calling.

04:31.827 --> 04:33.294
You know that the church

04:33.296 --> 04:35.964
will not allow women
to become priests.

04:35.966 --> 04:37.265
There are so many things...

04:37.267 --> 04:39.000
Father, they are not...

04:39.002 --> 04:40.835
- They will have to be.
- Why, Father?

04:40.837 --> 04:42.370
Why shouldn't a woman be allowed
to become a priest?

04:42.372 --> 04:44.709
It is the law of the church.

04:45.075 --> 04:47.207
Now look, we have had
this discussion several times

04:47.209 --> 04:48.311
over the past year.

04:48.945 --> 04:50.113
You leave me no choice.

04:50.447 --> 04:52.382
You are no longer to work
with the students.

04:52.815 --> 04:55.219
You are now assigned
to assist with the shut-ins.

04:55.918 --> 04:57.354
Do you understand?

04:59.822 --> 05:01.125
Yes, Father, I understand.

05:01.390 --> 05:03.660
Have a blessed day, Sister.

05:19.776 --> 05:22.947
Sister Alejandra,
where are you going?

05:24.080 --> 05:25.479
I'm leaving the school,

05:25.481 --> 05:27.147
but soon you'll have
a new teacher

05:27.149 --> 05:28.717
and she'll help you learn
amazing things.

05:28.719 --> 05:30.719
No, you are a teacher.

05:30.721 --> 05:33.124
We want you, Sister Alejandra.

05:33.724 --> 05:35.026
That won't be possible.

05:35.925 --> 05:37.260
Will I ever see you again?

05:40.029 --> 05:41.765
I promise
you will be in my heart.

05:47.070 --> 05:49.106
I will keep it always.
Thank you.

05:57.848 --> 06:00.718
Alejandra, I am so sorry
it had to come to this.

06:01.050 --> 06:02.416
You just have to be so careful

06:02.418 --> 06:04.387
when going against
church doctrine.

06:06.022 --> 06:07.692
What will you do now?

06:12.863 --> 06:14.065
<i>Hey, Sasha, it's Tommy.</i>

06:15.199 --> 06:16.931
Sorry I missed you last night.
I got hung up at work.

06:16.933 --> 06:19.067
<i>It's okay.
We must talk tonight.</i>

06:19.069 --> 06:20.168
Yeah, I'll call you later.

06:20.170 --> 06:21.105
All right, bye.

06:39.055 --> 06:40.955
Good morning, Mr. Reilly.

06:40.957 --> 06:42.190
Good morning, darling.
How are you this fine Monday?

06:42.192 --> 06:43.558
I am tired.

06:43.560 --> 06:45.293
How's your boy? Is he still
giving you a hard time?

06:45.295 --> 06:46.327
Oh, he just discovered girls.

06:46.329 --> 06:48.262
Why don't you bring him in?
I can have a talk.

06:48.264 --> 06:49.964
Oh no, baby.

06:49.966 --> 06:51.332
Listen, so it's
your mother's birthday.

06:51.334 --> 06:53.234
- Mm-hmm.
- I sent her a gift from you.

06:53.236 --> 06:54.536
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

06:54.538 --> 06:56.303
Hey, who's Alejandra Batista?

06:56.305 --> 06:58.205
Oh, that's a matter
sent over by Dunbar.

06:58.207 --> 06:59.274
- All right.
- Fine.

06:59.276 --> 07:00.474
- Tommy,
- Huh.

07:00.476 --> 07:01.945
- Call your mother.
- No.

07:06.349 --> 07:07.418
Take a seat.

07:08.185 --> 07:10.017
Brief me on the Solas case.

07:10.019 --> 07:12.053
Sure. Gwen Solas.
Gender discrimination case.

07:12.055 --> 07:14.055
Brilliant executive,
denied promotions,

07:14.057 --> 07:15.793
paid less
than her male counterparts.

07:16.091 --> 07:17.558
It's an open to shut trial,
right?

07:17.560 --> 07:18.993
It's a statement case
for other women

07:18.995 --> 07:20.294
bumping into the glass ceiling.

07:20.296 --> 07:21.996
Now, of course, my heart
really bleeds for Gwen.

07:21.998 --> 07:23.864
Except when you get
in front of a jury of eight men

07:23.866 --> 07:24.666
and they don't agree.

07:24.668 --> 07:26.203
Uh, set up
a settlement conference.

07:27.437 --> 07:29.036
If we settle, we'll be
leaving money on the table.

07:29.038 --> 07:30.438
Assuming we win in court,

07:30.440 --> 07:31.839
where the odds against
the plaintiff are two to one.

07:31.841 --> 07:33.875
So, there's a litigation risk.

07:33.877 --> 07:36.113
Not to mention the reputation
cost for the firm if we lose.

07:37.546 --> 07:38.948
Take the sure settlement.

07:39.315 --> 07:41.017
Tommy, you're not afraid
of trials, are you?

07:41.284 --> 07:42.950
What's our demand?

07:42.952 --> 07:44.351
- Two point five.
- What are they?

07:44.353 --> 07:45.522
- Seven fifty.
- What's it worth?

07:46.122 --> 07:47.391
- Nine hundred.
- Settle it.

07:59.202 --> 08:00.568
Oh, Mr. Dunbar.

08:00.570 --> 08:01.471
Tommy.

08:02.305 --> 08:04.005
What's this new case
you sent over?

08:04.007 --> 08:05.873
One of our biggest clients
called in a favor

08:05.875 --> 08:08.308
for her housekeeper's daughter,
Alejandra Batista.

08:08.310 --> 08:10.144
- Pro bono?
- Does that matter?

08:10.146 --> 08:11.945
Her company bills
five million a year.

08:11.947 --> 08:14.015
I'd mow her lawn
every weekend if she asked.

08:14.017 --> 08:15.219
Snort

08:15.517 --> 08:18.519
Plus, the firm requires,
what, 75 pro bono hours.

08:18.521 --> 08:20.391
You've got three.

08:20.623 --> 08:22.323
Is that really
the number you wanna take

08:22.325 --> 08:23.524
to the partnership committee
next month?

08:23.526 --> 08:25.296
No, sir.
What's this about?

08:25.562 --> 08:27.996
- Didn't Silk tell you?
- I was, uh...

08:27.998 --> 08:30.498
It's a case we don't want,
but we can't duck.

08:30.500 --> 08:31.901
Just make it go away.

08:32.235 --> 08:33.437
What are we settling?

08:33.636 --> 08:35.238
Woman's suing
the Catholic Church.

08:39.475 --> 08:40.942
Hi.
Can I help you?

08:40.943 --> 08:42.476
Uh, Tommy Reilly.

08:42.477 --> 08:44.145
- Okay, and your name?
- Ally Batista.

08:44.147 --> 08:45.148
Okay.

08:45.982 --> 08:47.418
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

08:50.085 --> 08:51.988
There's a Ally Batista
here to see you.

08:52.321 --> 08:53.389
Yeah, thanks.

08:54.056 --> 08:55.425
Please, let me take this, sir.

08:55.658 --> 08:57.393
- Don't let me down.
- Never do.

08:58.161 --> 08:59.563
Silk,

09:00.129 --> 09:01.998
Ms. Batista's in the lobby.
Would you meet her, please?

09:11.340 --> 09:12.573
Thank you, Betty.

09:12.575 --> 09:14.210
Ms. Batista, right this way.

09:19.049 --> 09:20.448
All right.
I tell you what.

09:20.450 --> 09:21.548
Why don't you put on
that little dress

09:21.550 --> 09:22.717
that I just bought you.

09:22.719 --> 09:25.086
And when I pick you up,
you can tell daddy all about it.

09:25.088 --> 09:26.457
Uh, I need to call you back.

09:27.623 --> 09:30.324
Ms. Batista...
Please sit down.

09:30.326 --> 09:32.059
Can I get you
some coffee, water?

09:32.061 --> 09:33.998
- No, thank you.
- Uh, Silk. Won't you stay?

09:35.031 --> 09:36.430
So, Mrs. Batista.

09:36.432 --> 09:37.333
Uhm, it's miss.

09:37.533 --> 09:39.235
I'm sorry. Ms. Batista.

09:40.235 --> 09:42.370
Let me just say
how truly sorry I am

09:42.372 --> 09:44.072
for everything
that's happened to you.

09:44.074 --> 09:44.972
What are you talking about?

09:44.974 --> 09:45.807
I was informed
that you're suing

09:45.809 --> 09:47.507
the Catholic Church,
so I assumed...

09:47.509 --> 09:48.443
I'm suing the Catholic Church,

09:48.445 --> 09:50.414
because I want to become
a Catholic priest.

09:53.382 --> 09:54.285
I see.

09:56.353 --> 09:59.654
Before we go any further down
that road, Ms. Batista,

09:59.656 --> 10:01.392
I apologize, I have to ask.

10:02.658 --> 10:04.093
Are you serious about this?

10:06.061 --> 10:08.599
You have an Irish name.
Are you Catholic, Mr. Reilly?

10:09.232 --> 10:11.035
I didn't have any choice
in the matter.

10:11.300 --> 10:12.667
Are you a practicing Catholic?

10:12.669 --> 10:13.570
I was an altar boy.

10:15.438 --> 10:17.138
Ms. Batista,
my religious practice

10:17.140 --> 10:18.539
is the least of your concern.

10:18.541 --> 10:21.108
You are suing
the Catholic Church

10:21.110 --> 10:23.144
to become a priest.

10:23.146 --> 10:25.112
No, Mr. Reilly, I wanna sue
the Catholic Church to allow me

10:25.114 --> 10:27.414
to enter the seminary
so that I can become a priest.

10:27.416 --> 10:29.185
- Ms. Batista...
- Call me Ally.

10:29.651 --> 10:31.686
- You can't become a priest.
- Because I'm a woman?

10:31.688 --> 10:33.755
Last time I checked,
there were laws in this country

10:33.757 --> 10:36.156
that prohibit discrimination
based on gender.

10:36.158 --> 10:37.158
Yes, but...

10:37.160 --> 10:38.092
Is the Catholic Church
an institution

10:38.094 --> 10:40.160
and governed
by the laws of this country?

10:40.162 --> 10:41.194
Uh, you're over simplifying.

10:41.196 --> 10:42.295
Then how can the church

10:42.297 --> 10:44.598
discriminate against me
based solely on my gender?

10:44.600 --> 10:46.433
Are you sure you wouldn't rather
become a lawyer

10:46.435 --> 10:47.467
instead of a priest?

10:47.469 --> 10:48.671
Don't patronize me, Mr. Reilly.

10:49.671 --> 10:50.974
Ms. Batista,

10:52.175 --> 10:54.645
I don't think God himself
could help you become a priest.

10:55.045 --> 10:57.779
The only thing I don't have
in way of qualifications,

10:57.781 --> 10:59.116
is a penis.

11:00.182 --> 11:00.715
Why is that
a fundamental requirement

11:00.717 --> 11:02.019
for the priesthood?

11:06.589 --> 11:07.657
I have no idea.

11:08.458 --> 11:10.625
All priests
take a vow of celibacy.

11:10.627 --> 11:13.763
So, what difference does it make
what sex organ a priest has?

11:18.401 --> 11:19.402
Could you help me
out here, Silk?

11:20.302 --> 11:22.470
We're supposed to avoid
a lawsuit.

11:22.472 --> 11:24.472
Well, maybe we'll get lucky

11:24.474 --> 11:26.274
and the church will want to
settle to avoid the notoriety.

11:26.276 --> 11:28.108
Unless they decide
to let me study

11:28.110 --> 11:29.679
to become a priest,
I have no intention of settling.

11:32.849 --> 11:34.481
We don't like to go to court,

11:34.483 --> 11:36.217
unless we have
a fighting chance to win.

11:36.219 --> 11:38.351
So, why don't we take
the weekend,

11:38.353 --> 11:39.754
we'll think about it,
you can think about it,

11:39.756 --> 11:41.355
and we'll talk again on Monday.

11:41.357 --> 11:42.490
My mind won't change.

11:42.492 --> 11:44.257
If you won't represent me,

11:44.259 --> 11:45.425
then Mr. Dunbar
will find someone who will.

11:45.427 --> 11:46.362
Okay, I understand.

11:47.564 --> 11:49.597
We'll be in touch.
We'll do a little research

11:49.599 --> 11:51.399
and I'll contact you
within a week.

11:51.401 --> 11:52.469
Thank you for your time.

11:59.809 --> 12:02.146
I wanna know everything
about Ms. Batista.

12:02.377 --> 12:04.511
Put together a memorandum
about the viability

12:04.513 --> 12:06.213
of getting past motion
to dismiss.

12:06.215 --> 12:07.483
You think
there's something here?

12:07.816 --> 12:09.052
I dunno.

12:09.451 --> 12:10.720
Just doing my due diligence.

12:11.588 --> 12:12.555
Come on.

12:24.367 --> 12:25.669
Yes, Father John.

12:26.835 --> 12:28.436
Yes.

12:28.438 --> 12:29.807
Yes, thank you, sir.
Good bye.

12:37.680 --> 12:41.651
Alejandra, we have raised you
to be a good Catholic.

12:42.451 --> 12:45.522
All of your life,
you have made us proud.

12:45.787 --> 12:48.222
But this time, you have brought
shame on the family

12:48.224 --> 12:49.789
- with this silly priest thing.
- But I...

12:49.791 --> 12:52.296
How can we go
to Mass on Sunday now?

12:52.795 --> 12:56.496
Every time Father John sees us,
he'll be thinking,

12:56.498 --> 12:59.435
"Oh, Mr. Batista,
he cannot control his family."

12:59.636 --> 13:01.202
- You make me look weak.
- I...

13:01.204 --> 13:03.540
No.
You don't speak.

13:04.273 --> 13:06.243
You must respect tradition.

13:08.210 --> 13:09.776
- Say something.
- You just said...

13:09.778 --> 13:11.212
Urgh, this is too much.

13:11.214 --> 13:12.349
- Please!
- No.

13:30.800 --> 13:32.202
Oh, Tommy.

13:32.868 --> 13:34.537
Happy birthday.

13:34.771 --> 13:36.470
That dress makes you look
even more beautiful than ever.

13:36.472 --> 13:40.244
Oh, Irish blarney
just like your father. Oh!

13:41.276 --> 13:42.679
So, how's what's her name?

13:43.246 --> 13:44.645
Who's what's her name?

13:44.647 --> 13:46.614
Urgh, you're a bad boy.

13:46.616 --> 13:49.217
Maybe you'd be able
to remember their names

13:49.219 --> 13:51.986
if they stuck around
for more than two weeks.

13:51.988 --> 13:54.690
You're just like your father
with that wandering eye.

13:54.924 --> 13:56.727
So, what are you working on now?

13:57.392 --> 14:00.428
Actually, Dunbar dropped
a pro bono case in my lap.

14:00.430 --> 14:01.928
It's about a young woman
who wants to sue

14:01.930 --> 14:03.533
the Catholic Church
to become a priest.

14:07.336 --> 14:08.769
You know, your, uh,

14:08.771 --> 14:10.438
your aunt Dotty's hip
is bothering her.

14:10.440 --> 14:12.439
And, and Rose is well, Rose.

14:12.441 --> 14:14.308
It's okay.
You don't wanna talk about it.

14:14.310 --> 14:15.912
I probably know
your feelings anyway.

14:16.679 --> 14:18.248
She doesn't have that right.

14:18.614 --> 14:20.780
Mom, I don't want
this case to go to trial

14:20.782 --> 14:21.918
any more than you do.

14:22.517 --> 14:24.754
But if I blow this,
I won't make partner.

14:25.421 --> 14:27.690
Well, then you'll have to make
partner as some other firm.

14:27.890 --> 14:30.627
Because if you take on
this case and win...

14:31.661 --> 14:35.199
you'll change the religion
I've practiced all my life.

14:35.397 --> 14:38.634
- That your father practiced.
- He didn't practice.

14:39.602 --> 14:41.669
Poor man never recovered
from Vatican II.

14:41.671 --> 14:43.574
He never recovered
from Irish whiskey.

14:43.873 --> 14:45.709
You wanna have
a real conversation?

14:46.508 --> 14:48.675
- Let's have one.
- Okay.

14:48.677 --> 14:51.812
What about the millions
of Catholics who do practice?

14:51.814 --> 14:55.448
Do you really think you have
the right to do this?

14:55.450 --> 14:57.918
We are a nation of laws
and no one,

14:57.920 --> 15:00.888
including the Catholic Church,
gets to be above the law.

15:00.890 --> 15:03.460
Yeah. What about
the laws of God? Tommy?

15:03.892 --> 15:06.294
Mmm? Where do the play in this?

15:06.296 --> 15:07.761
Can we please not do this?

15:07.763 --> 15:09.932
I'm sorry.
It's your birthday.

15:12.669 --> 15:15.303
Tommy, if you force
the Catholic Church

15:15.305 --> 15:17.241
to make a woman a priest,

15:18.041 --> 15:20.510
I don't know
if I'll be able to forgive you.

15:43.065 --> 15:45.601
I actually may need
to make it an early night.

15:45.868 --> 15:47.601
Oh, why?

15:47.603 --> 15:49.506
I had
a pretty crazy day at work.

15:50.339 --> 15:52.776
This woman wants to sue
the Catholic Church.

15:53.475 --> 15:55.011
She wants to be
a priest.

15:56.978 --> 15:59.882
I'm sorry.
Maybe I'm just naive.

16:00.382 --> 16:03.384
But isn't the law pretty, uhm...

16:03.386 --> 16:05.086
Definitive?

16:05.088 --> 16:06.853
...definitive on the separation
of church and state?

16:06.855 --> 16:09.058
I may not see it that way.

16:09.925 --> 16:11.762
And then there's always
the Tommy way.

16:12.395 --> 16:14.095
Doesn't matter who's life
you may ruin.

16:14.097 --> 16:15.399
Oh, come on.

16:20.103 --> 16:22.005
- Why don't you answer it?
- For what?

16:23.573 --> 16:24.875
Well, you don't have
anything to hide.

16:25.074 --> 16:26.676
Don't have anything
to prove either.

16:28.411 --> 16:29.610
It's just always
gonna be like this,

16:29.612 --> 16:30.977
- isn't it?
- Like what?

16:30.979 --> 16:32.449
Like you can't commit
to anyone.

16:32.781 --> 16:34.550
Oh, Wh-wh-what?

16:35.050 --> 16:37.387
You are so full of it.

16:40.857 --> 16:42.622
Is that all
you ever think about?

16:42.624 --> 16:45.027
Hmm? Am I just
some sex toy to you?

16:50.833 --> 16:53.467
Tommy Reilly.
The new Gloria Oren.

16:53.469 --> 16:54.735
Champion of women's rights.

16:54.737 --> 16:56.136
No gloating.
It's unseemly.

16:56.138 --> 16:58.572
- Is she looking for a pay day?
- I wish.

16:58.574 --> 17:00.644
I think the only way
to win this, is not to play.

17:02.177 --> 17:04.044
Silk, what did you find out?

17:04.046 --> 17:05.880
Yeah, if we file it'll be
a case of first impression.

17:05.882 --> 17:07.046
At no time has this course
of action been raised

17:07.048 --> 17:08.782
in a state or federal court.

17:08.785 --> 17:09.949
- Do we have jurisdiction?
- Short answer's yes.

17:09.951 --> 17:11.551
We've seen it in sex abuse cases

17:11.554 --> 17:12.719
but never in
ecclesiastical rules.

17:12.721 --> 17:14.454
Okay, do we have a case?

17:14.457 --> 17:16.189
We have
the Civil Right Act of 1964,

17:16.191 --> 17:17.891
which prohibits
the discrimination of women

17:17.893 --> 17:19.794
for employment
without good cause.

17:19.796 --> 17:21.097
Is a priest an employee?

17:21.564 --> 17:23.096
No, at best
he's an independent contractor.

17:23.098 --> 17:25.064
- Well, that's a problem.
- Yes and no.

17:25.066 --> 17:27.101
We're not only suing
for her to become a priest,

17:27.103 --> 17:29.169
we're suing for her to have
the right to enter the seminary

17:29.171 --> 17:30.640
to study for the priesthood.

17:30.873 --> 17:32.439
I think that's what
we need to focus on.

17:32.441 --> 17:34.073
A seminarian is a student.

17:34.075 --> 17:35.876
It's only after ordination
that he becomes a priest.

17:35.878 --> 17:37.544
We have case law
expanding a woman's right

17:37.546 --> 17:39.213
to venues
previously restricted to males.

17:39.215 --> 17:41.081
Like educational institutions.

17:41.083 --> 17:42.816
Now, that may get us past
the motion to dismiss.

17:42.818 --> 17:44.653
- If we can do that...
- We're before a jury.

17:45.988 --> 17:47.787
Tell me about
Ms. Alejandra Batista.

17:47.789 --> 17:49.189
Age 28,

17:49.191 --> 17:51.492
born September 18,
1988 in Mexico.

17:51.494 --> 17:53.761
Immigrated to the US in '96
with her family

17:53.763 --> 17:55.595
when her father
got a job at the oil refineries.

17:55.597 --> 17:57.531
What else?

17:57.533 --> 17:58.732
I was able to interview
several neighbors and sisters.

17:58.734 --> 18:00.601
Everyone thinks she's a saint.

18:00.603 --> 18:01.968
- Where does she work?
- The Sisters of Blessed Charity.

18:01.970 --> 18:03.704
- Of course.
- Uh, she brings food

18:03.706 --> 18:05.473
to the shut-ins,
collects clothes for the poor.

18:05.475 --> 18:06.776
- Any history with the bad boys?
- Nope.

18:07.709 --> 18:09.209
- Girlfriends?
- No social life

18:09.211 --> 18:10.511
outside of church.

18:10.513 --> 18:11.946
Attends mass every day.

18:11.948 --> 18:13.546
I had my nerds
do a run on the internet.

18:13.548 --> 18:14.782
- And?
- No Facebook, Twitter,

18:14.784 --> 18:16.217
e-mail accounts,
no credit cards,

18:16.219 --> 18:17.618
traffic tickets or debt.

18:17.620 --> 18:18.718
It's as if she doesn't exist.

18:18.720 --> 18:20.086
Social security number,

18:20.088 --> 18:21.121
date of birth,
everything checks.

18:21.123 --> 18:22.025
I swear it's Snow White.

18:22.924 --> 18:24.691
After all the wicked witches
we handle,

18:24.693 --> 18:26.796
it'll be refreshing
to represent Snow White.

18:29.498 --> 18:31.000
Any more information
before we move?

18:31.667 --> 18:32.669
- Move?
- More?

18:32.969 --> 18:33.903
Dunbar?

18:34.836 --> 18:36.205
I'm just doing my job y'all.

18:43.112 --> 18:44.777
Oh hey.

18:44.779 --> 18:46.450
I don't believe
I've seen you in a while.

18:46.649 --> 18:48.148
I must be coming to masses
you aren't officiating.

18:48.150 --> 18:49.652
You know, your father
used to say that.

18:49.852 --> 18:51.086
I didn't believe him either.

18:51.888 --> 18:53.187
You have a few minutes for me?

18:53.189 --> 18:54.690
Sure, sure, sure.
What do you need?

18:55.958 --> 18:57.157
I thought you weren't
supposed to smoke

18:57.159 --> 18:58.958
in front of your parishioners.

18:58.960 --> 19:00.630
Who says I'm smoking
in front of a parishioner?

19:01.063 --> 19:02.563
I need some advice.

19:02.565 --> 19:03.831
- Really?
- Well, not advice.

19:03.833 --> 19:05.168
More like some information.

19:06.401 --> 19:09.703
I was interested in the steps
that you would need to take

19:09.705 --> 19:11.738
to become a priest.

19:11.740 --> 19:13.040
Forget it.

19:13.042 --> 19:14.707
You probably blew
four rules today.

19:14.709 --> 19:15.778
Ha ha.

19:16.278 --> 19:17.780
It's for a potential client.

19:17.979 --> 19:20.083
Ah. Okay, well, uhm...

19:20.716 --> 19:23.016
Well, a candidate has to be
an unmarried male,

19:23.018 --> 19:26.219
baptized and confirmed
in the Catholic religion.

19:26.221 --> 19:28.322
That's it?
Well, I qualify.

19:28.324 --> 19:30.227
Oh, not so fast.

19:30.825 --> 19:32.692
Then you next, next you need
to speak with a priest

19:32.694 --> 19:34.328
- and then the parish.
- Mmm.

19:34.330 --> 19:36.764
And if you have
a good reputation,

19:36.766 --> 19:40.833
a personal relationship with God
and dedicated to the church,

19:40.835 --> 19:42.303
he recommends you
to the diocese.

19:42.305 --> 19:43.606
I just failed.

19:44.873 --> 19:46.977
Any tests?

19:47.709 --> 19:50.546
Well, since
the Catholic scandals and all,

19:51.113 --> 19:53.046
a candidate must meet
with psychiatrists

19:53.048 --> 19:54.984
and go through
a battery of tests. Yes.

19:57.053 --> 19:58.588
And all this is documented?

19:59.255 --> 20:00.920
Yes and then submitted
to the bishop.

20:00.922 --> 20:02.691
- And he makes the decision?
- Yes.

20:02.924 --> 20:05.892
What about a case of a denial?
What's the appeals process like?

20:05.894 --> 20:07.730
This isn't a court of law,
dummy.

20:08.663 --> 20:10.363
All right, let me make this
as clear as I can.

20:10.365 --> 20:12.268
Say my client
can pass all the tests,

20:12.767 --> 20:14.802
is devoted to helping people,

20:14.804 --> 20:17.274
has a deep personal relationship
with God, the whole nine yards.

20:17.806 --> 20:18.874
So, what's the problem?

20:19.709 --> 20:20.776
No penis.

20:21.043 --> 20:23.313
- What?
- My client's a woman.

20:24.880 --> 20:27.880
Please tell me we're not talking
of a Sister Alejandra.

20:27.882 --> 20:28.817
We are.

20:29.651 --> 20:31.821
Tommy, I'm gonna tell you
something.

20:32.721 --> 20:34.721
Now, I've known you
since you were a young child.

20:34.723 --> 20:36.559
Things have always
come easy for you.

20:36.892 --> 20:39.129
Sports, grades, women, money.

20:39.996 --> 20:41.361
Listen to me very carefully.

20:41.363 --> 20:44.034
You are not the one
to take this on.

20:44.734 --> 20:48.204
My client came to me for help.
I have an obligation.

20:49.071 --> 20:51.775
No one here cares
about your obligations.

20:52.208 --> 20:54.209
You are toying
with a way of life.

20:54.776 --> 20:57.244
Listen, if Jesus Christ
wanted women to become priests,

20:57.246 --> 20:59.916
he would have made his apostles
women, but he didn't.

21:00.415 --> 21:03.217
He had many candidates.
His own mother, Mary.

21:03.219 --> 21:06.219
Mary Magdalene.
But he chose not to.

21:08.024 --> 21:10.327
So, you're saying,
the church's entire basis...

21:10.926 --> 21:13.863
is that Jesus didn't appoint
a woman as an apostle?

21:14.396 --> 21:16.095
And you're okay with that?

21:16.097 --> 21:17.898
When it comes to matters
of faith and morals

21:17.900 --> 21:19.102
in the Catholic Church,

21:19.701 --> 21:20.903
absolutely.

21:22.004 --> 21:23.073
Look, I gotta go.

21:23.706 --> 21:24.808
Tommy,

21:25.007 --> 21:26.142
don't do this, son.

21:33.149 --> 21:34.881
Do you know why

21:34.883 --> 21:37.217
the Catholic Church
forbids women priests?

21:37.219 --> 21:40.153
Here's a hint: There's no direct
biblical reference for it.

21:40.155 --> 21:41.688
The scripture's silent on that.

21:41.690 --> 21:43.157
So, it's all divine revelation.

21:43.159 --> 21:44.757
Their only justification,

21:44.759 --> 21:46.159
is that Jesus
didn't appoint women

21:46.161 --> 21:47.631
to be among
the original apostles.

21:47.830 --> 21:48.865
No other reason.

21:49.131 --> 21:50.930
I'd go to war with that story.

21:50.932 --> 21:52.299
Will, will that overcome
the religious liberty law?

21:52.301 --> 21:54.034
Jane?

21:54.036 --> 21:55.968
The act states that
"the government shall not

21:55.970 --> 21:58.005
substantially burden a person's
exercise of religion",

21:58.007 --> 22:00.142
but it provides an exception
if two conditions are both met.

22:00.442 --> 22:02.810
- So, it's anti-discrimination.
- Yes.

22:02.812 --> 22:04.378
And the second condition
is that the rule must be

22:04.380 --> 22:06.080
the least restrictive way

22:06.082 --> 22:06.950
in which to further
government interest.

22:08.084 --> 22:09.816
So, this is a straight-up

22:09.818 --> 22:11.921
anti-discrimination
civil rights case.

22:12.321 --> 22:14.388
You sound like a guy
preparing for trial.

22:14.390 --> 22:16.290
If we can't scare the church
into a settlement,

22:16.292 --> 22:18.361
we'd better be prepared
to fight them in court.

22:19.228 --> 22:21.061
Jane, draft the complaint.
I want it out tomorrow.

22:21.063 --> 22:23.162
Uh, does Dunbar know
you want to file a lawsuit?

22:23.164 --> 22:24.401
He will soon enough.

22:24.799 --> 22:26.800
Tommy, you know what this
could mean for us

22:26.802 --> 22:27.904
and your partnership?

22:38.113 --> 22:39.149
Oh.

22:40.149 --> 22:41.448
They said I might find
you here.

22:41.450 --> 22:43.283
Mind if I join?

22:43.285 --> 22:44.954
- As long you can keep up.
- I might pull a hamstring.

22:46.889 --> 22:48.257
Filed a complaint this morning,

22:48.490 --> 22:50.259
- to a favorable judge.
- Thank you.

22:51.059 --> 22:53.128
- We need to prepare.
- We will.

23:04.539 --> 23:06.105
Thought you were some important
college football player.

23:06.107 --> 23:08.043
I was an unimportant
football player.

23:08.911 --> 23:10.080
And you were valedictorian?

23:11.146 --> 23:13.112
An all-girls school.
You're probably not impressed.

23:13.114 --> 23:16.850
I was 23rd in my class.
Believe me, I'm impressed.

23:16.852 --> 23:18.455
- Twenty-third?
- Hm-mmm.

23:19.087 --> 23:20.853
Maybe I should find
a smarter lawyer.

23:20.855 --> 23:22.825
Ha, she has a sense of humor.

23:23.325 --> 23:26.763
Do you think I'm some sort of
humorless religious fanatic?

23:28.029 --> 23:29.065
No.

23:30.865 --> 23:33.302
I think you're a woman of
impressive faith, Ms. Batista.

23:34.370 --> 23:36.072
Ally.
Call me Ally.

23:36.404 --> 23:37.973
One last chance, Ally.

23:38.807 --> 23:40.142
There's no shame in quitting.

23:41.177 --> 23:43.342
Save your mother,
yourself, your friends,

23:43.344 --> 23:45.278
all the heartache
that's coming your way.

23:45.280 --> 23:47.015
I'm not afraid.

23:47.882 --> 23:48.817
It's God's will.

23:54.890 --> 23:55.959
God's will.

24:02.398 --> 24:03.366
Yes.

24:05.200 --> 24:06.302
Cardinal Sierra.

24:06.969 --> 24:09.305
Yes, I just got it.
I agree, this is...

24:10.271 --> 24:11.240
unique.

24:14.008 --> 24:15.478
Yes, I will have local counsel.

24:16.245 --> 24:18.078
Yes, I will be there as well.

24:18.080 --> 24:19.415
And can I just say that...

24:32.161 --> 24:33.962
Yeah.
Get over here right now.

24:38.234 --> 24:40.203
Sit over there.

24:43.037 --> 24:44.507
I think we have
a strong case, sir.

24:44.973 --> 24:46.540
The Catholic business leaders

24:46.542 --> 24:48.976
who called to complain
this morning,

24:48.978 --> 24:50.412
just want this to go away.

24:50.979 --> 24:53.479
And if you recall, that's why
I assigned this case to you.

24:53.481 --> 24:55.184
I appreciate that, sir.

24:55.484 --> 24:58.217
But our client, Ms. Batista,
I don't think she'll settle...

24:58.219 --> 25:00.989
You're a settler.
That's what I told you to do.

25:02.223 --> 25:04.557
But, you also said
that we owe a favor

25:04.559 --> 25:06.929
to one of our
highest paying clients.

25:07.930 --> 25:09.496
I'm in a catch-22, sir.

25:09.498 --> 25:10.533
You wanna make partner?

25:11.967 --> 25:13.902
Tommy,
do you wanna make partner?

25:14.436 --> 25:15.872
Then figure it out.

25:23.545 --> 25:25.081
And settle this.

25:35.056 --> 25:36.959
Stop! Ah!

25:37.258 --> 25:38.493
Help!

25:39.694 --> 25:42.197
You'll be punished
for your disobedience.

25:42.664 --> 25:44.433
Hey! Hey!

25:45.200 --> 25:47.237
Hey, hey! Come here!

25:48.603 --> 25:50.273
Sister, are you okay?

25:51.105 --> 25:52.538
I am.

25:52.540 --> 25:53.876
I need some help here!

25:55.009 --> 25:56.179
I need some help!

25:59.480 --> 26:00.482
Are you okay?

26:01.350 --> 26:03.620
- What happened?
- She'll be fine.

26:04.152 --> 26:05.718
A man attacked me

26:05.720 --> 26:08.388
and said he'd punish me
for my disobedience.

26:08.390 --> 26:10.023
I'm a little shaken up,
but I'll be all right.

26:10.025 --> 26:11.358
The Lord is my light
and my salvation.

26:11.360 --> 26:12.059
It's not safe here, Ally.

26:12.061 --> 26:13.329
We gotta get you out of here.

26:14.296 --> 26:16.132
Silk, get a picture of that.
Send it to me.

26:18.667 --> 26:20.003
Yeah, it's Tommy.

26:22.470 --> 26:23.602
May need your help.

27:22.730 --> 27:23.632
Enrico!

27:25.066 --> 27:26.335
Your Eminence.

27:27.702 --> 27:30.672
It is unfortunate
that these events have occurred.

27:31.539 --> 27:32.709
Yes, I'm afraid so.

27:33.808 --> 27:35.143
So...

27:36.210 --> 27:37.980
What will be do about this?

27:38.546 --> 27:41.217
I have a pretrial conference
before the judge.

27:42.116 --> 27:44.686
I also just found out
that Ms. Batista was attacked

27:45.254 --> 27:46.753
in the church.

27:46.755 --> 27:48.224
- Is she all right?
- I don't know.

27:49.424 --> 27:51.193
But we will be blamed for this.

27:53.562 --> 27:56.466
They would portray us
as the bad guys in any event.

27:56.765 --> 27:59.701
Just make sure
this doesn't turn into a circus.

28:00.268 --> 28:01.336
I understand.

28:04.105 --> 28:06.339
I interviewed a half a dozen
Catholic theologians

28:06.341 --> 28:08.140
who do not support
the church's position

28:08.142 --> 28:09.211
on male only priests.

28:09.545 --> 28:11.343
A couple of women
even went to the Vatican

28:11.345 --> 28:12.512
and challenged the Pope.

28:12.514 --> 28:13.846
Any candidates?

28:13.848 --> 28:15.314
They've all been defrocked
over it.

28:15.316 --> 28:17.117
No Catholic scholars.

28:17.119 --> 28:18.651
Renzulli will just
dismiss their views

28:18.653 --> 28:19.788
as rants of a rogue group.

28:20.823 --> 28:22.158
Then what do we present?

28:23.225 --> 28:24.327
I'm not sure yet.

28:25.360 --> 28:26.462
Talking settlement?

28:27.796 --> 28:30.397
Why not? I thought Dunbar
was gonna stab me

28:30.399 --> 28:32.401
with his pruning shears
for filing a suit.

28:33.235 --> 28:34.367
But unless
the church backs down,

28:34.369 --> 28:35.468
I don't see how we settle.

28:35.470 --> 28:36.405
Gotta try, right.

28:36.738 --> 28:38.271
If they don't back down,

28:38.273 --> 28:39.709
maybe we can meet
Dunbar halfway.

28:41.043 --> 28:43.079
I know that I'm the last person
in this firm he wants at trial.

28:43.778 --> 28:47.049
Tommy, Ms. Batista
isn't gonna settle.

28:47.649 --> 28:49.115
I have to get
to the courthouse.

28:49.117 --> 28:50.316
Hm-mmm.
Go get 'em.

28:50.318 --> 28:51.620
Always do, partner. Hey...

28:52.822 --> 28:55.358
do you mind checking on Ally?
See if she needs anything.

29:08.437 --> 29:10.373
- Enrico Renzulli.
- Thomas Reilly.

29:11.507 --> 29:12.507
Is your client here?

29:12.807 --> 29:14.242
Not until the trial.

29:14.575 --> 29:15.545
If there's a trial.

29:16.745 --> 29:17.647
Settling?

29:19.515 --> 29:20.816
All rise!

29:22.584 --> 29:24.351
Court is in session.

29:24.353 --> 29:26.386
The Honorable
Judge Watford presiding.

29:26.388 --> 29:27.821
No talking.

29:27.823 --> 29:29.559
Anyone using
any electronic devices,

29:29.790 --> 29:31.193
will be escorted out.

29:31.426 --> 29:32.695
You may now be seated.

29:33.194 --> 29:34.761
We are here on the matter

29:34.763 --> 29:36.763
of Batista versus
the Archdiocese of New Orleans

29:36.765 --> 29:38.668
and Bishop Cardinal Jose Sierra.

29:39.168 --> 29:41.204
Is plaintiff's counsel present?

29:41.702 --> 29:43.303
Thomas J. Reilly.

29:43.305 --> 29:44.373
Law Offices of Finlay
and Dunbar.

29:44.873 --> 29:46.374
And defense counsel?

29:46.874 --> 29:50.610
For the Archdiocese
and Cardinal Bishop Jose Sierra,

29:50.612 --> 29:52.646
Monsignor Enrico Renzulli,

29:52.648 --> 29:54.581
counsel of the United States
Conference of Catholic Bishops.

29:54.583 --> 29:56.651
Counsel,
please approach the bench.

30:03.624 --> 30:06.458
Monsignor, I know you filed
a motion to dismiss

30:06.460 --> 30:08.661
and you've each requested
oral argument.

30:08.663 --> 30:10.263
Before I renew decision,

30:10.265 --> 30:12.334
have you two
had a chance to speak?

30:13.701 --> 30:15.238
No, Your Honor.

30:15.437 --> 30:17.504
Well, Mr. Reilly,
due to the gravity of this case,

30:17.506 --> 30:18.705
may I make a suggestion?

30:18.707 --> 30:20.207
Yes, Your Honor.

30:20.209 --> 30:21.774
I'm going to reserve decision.

30:21.776 --> 30:23.709
I'd like to see you
back in here on Friday.

30:23.711 --> 30:25.844
And let's say you show
the Monsignor some hospitality.

30:25.846 --> 30:27.880
See if we can't come
to a resolution

30:27.882 --> 30:29.448
before we go any further.

30:29.450 --> 30:30.853
Counsel, step back.

30:31.719 --> 30:33.753
Defendant's motion
to dismiss

30:33.755 --> 30:35.589
has been marked submit.

30:35.591 --> 30:37.657
Parties will be back
in this courtroom on Friday.

30:39.460 --> 30:40.695
Looks like I'm buying.

30:40.895 --> 30:41.863
No need.

30:42.965 --> 30:45.434
Come by the Cardinal's home
for dinner this evening.

31:13.461 --> 31:15.297
- Thank you for coming.
- Thanks for having me.

31:16.632 --> 31:19.568
- Would you like a drink?
- Uh, sure.

31:20.434 --> 31:22.604
- It's been a rough day.
- Bet it has.

31:24.573 --> 31:26.038
So, how is your client
holding up?

31:26.040 --> 31:27.640
She's strong.

31:27.642 --> 31:29.312
Considering
she was just attacked.

31:30.278 --> 31:31.814
You wouldn't know anything
about that, would you?

31:32.314 --> 31:34.584
I'm not even going to dignify
that with a response.

31:35.517 --> 31:36.749
How are your clients
holding up?

31:36.751 --> 31:38.653
- They're bent.
- I'm sure.

31:39.888 --> 31:41.888
Thomas, I'm glad the judge
asked us to get together.

31:41.890 --> 31:45.457
I would like to work this out
before it's too late.

31:45.459 --> 31:46.562
Too late for what?

31:46.761 --> 31:47.963
For you to turn back.

31:49.430 --> 31:50.399
Is that a threat?

31:50.766 --> 31:52.532
- No.
- Then, what is it?

31:52.534 --> 31:53.536
Advice.

31:54.603 --> 31:56.335
You see, Thomas,
you can't win this case

31:56.337 --> 31:57.903
and that's a fact.

31:57.905 --> 32:00.408
My client's commitment
is unwavering.

32:01.809 --> 32:04.279
I hear you're allergic
to the inside of a courtroom.

32:05.013 --> 32:06.446
You really
should make this go away

32:06.448 --> 32:08.448
before you embarrass yourself.

32:08.450 --> 32:11.650
Well, if you're ready to remove
the stained glass ceiling,

32:11.652 --> 32:13.986
then, of course,
we are open to a settlement.

32:13.988 --> 32:16.459
Not possible.
Not now. Not ever.

32:17.426 --> 32:18.327
Okay.

32:19.361 --> 32:21.464
I think we've established
our initial positions.

32:21.896 --> 32:23.531
I'm surprised.

32:23.765 --> 32:26.369
Does Kent Dunbar agree
that a settlement is impossible?

32:27.401 --> 32:30.870
Mr. Dunbar and I both agree
that absent a better solution,

32:30.872 --> 32:34.107
this case should be settled by
a jury of Ms. Batista's peers.

32:34.109 --> 32:36.476
Even if you get past
my motion to dismiss,

32:36.478 --> 32:38.111
she'd never be a priest. Period.

32:38.113 --> 32:40.846
So, my question is,
"Why are you doing this?"

32:40.848 --> 32:42.417
Because I believe
she has a case.

32:43.719 --> 32:45.351
Are you a Catholic?

32:45.353 --> 32:46.521
I've been hearing that
a lot lately.

32:46.955 --> 32:48.424
I was raised Catholic.

32:48.657 --> 32:49.956
Do you feel
any conflict of interest

32:49.958 --> 32:51.424
in representing Ms. Batista?

32:51.426 --> 32:52.862
I don't.

32:53.362 --> 32:55.628
I accept the teachings of Jesus
as revealed in scripture.

32:55.630 --> 32:57.630
That does not include
the man made rules

32:57.632 --> 32:58.834
of cardinals and popes.

33:02.671 --> 33:05.074
Have you ever heard the term
'cafeteria Catholic'?

33:05.640 --> 33:07.774
A cafeteria Catholic
picks and chooses

33:07.776 --> 33:09.508
what church teachings
he accepts,

33:09.510 --> 33:11.846
but to be a Catholic,

33:12.713 --> 33:14.549
one must accept
all the teachings.

33:14.982 --> 33:18.450
Okay, look, if Judge Watford
sustains your motion

33:18.452 --> 33:19.689
and throws us out, that's it.

33:19.988 --> 33:21.821
If not, the media's
gonna beat this to death

33:21.823 --> 33:23.689
and I don't believe
either of us want that.

33:23.691 --> 33:24.693
No, we don't.

33:27.395 --> 33:28.663
I put on two witnesses only.

33:29.430 --> 33:31.630
Ms. Batista plus
Dr. Sylvia Touran.

33:31.632 --> 33:33.867
It's a psychologist
appointed by the Archdiocese

33:33.869 --> 33:35.901
to screen potential seminarians.

33:35.903 --> 33:37.504
Who do you expect of me?

33:37.506 --> 33:38.807
You put on
Bishop Cardinal Sierra.

33:42.177 --> 33:44.076
You'll be relying solely

33:44.078 --> 33:46.178
on your cross examination
of Archbishop Sierra to prove

33:46.180 --> 33:48.648
that the church's position
is unreasonable?

33:48.650 --> 33:49.719
That's right.

34:14.141 --> 34:16.610
Oh, hey.
Hey, there's a camera.

34:17.578 --> 34:19.011
I'm with the C1 News Agency.

34:19.013 --> 34:20.415
I don't care where you work.

34:21.549 --> 34:23.482
You're gonna get out of here.
Do you understand me?

34:23.484 --> 34:24.386
Yeah.
Yeah.

34:40.067 --> 34:41.701
- Hello.
- Nicki, it's Tommy.

34:41.703 --> 34:43.902
I was, I was
just thinking about you.

34:43.904 --> 34:44.973
Want to see
what you're up to tonight.

34:45.706 --> 34:46.674
<i>Why?</i>

34:46.942 --> 34:48.476
Cause I miss you, baby.

34:48.777 --> 34:50.542
<i>Cut the crap!</i>

34:50.543 --> 34:51.780
Tommy, what do you want?

34:54.149 --> 34:56.649
Look, I got a big day at court
Friday and I wanted to see

34:56.650 --> 34:57.986
if you could be there for me.

34:58.652 --> 35:01.520
No. No, you don't need
anybody, Tommy.

35:01.522 --> 35:02.791
<i>That's your whole problem.</i>

35:07.629 --> 35:09.431
I have to take this call.
Can we talk later?

35:11.065 --> 35:12.498
No.

35:12.500 --> 35:13.701
- Hello?
<i>- Tommy.</i>

35:14.535 --> 35:15.937
<i>The press have found Ally.</i>

35:16.671 --> 35:17.672
I'll be right there.

35:42.763 --> 35:43.929
You okay?

35:43.931 --> 35:45.000
I'm fine.

35:45.700 --> 35:47.132
Do you mind taking her bag
to the car?

35:47.134 --> 35:48.036
Yeah.

35:54.075 --> 35:57.609
Are you absolutely sure that you
wanna continue down this path?

35:57.611 --> 35:59.214
There's no shame in settling.

35:59.781 --> 36:02.183
This kind of case
brings the nuts out of hiding.

36:03.051 --> 36:05.754
I'm not afraid.
And I told you I'm not settling.

36:06.721 --> 36:07.756
It's God's will.

36:08.790 --> 36:10.759
You can't fault a guy
for trying to protect you.

36:18.600 --> 36:19.502
Let's go.

36:38.986 --> 36:40.087
Jane, let us out right here.

36:43.725 --> 36:46.094
This case is an attack
on religious freedom.

36:46.861 --> 36:48.795
And on the more
than one billion Catholics

36:48.797 --> 36:49.898
around the world.

36:50.732 --> 36:52.801
The church is confident
that God's will shall prevail.

36:58.939 --> 37:00.973
Excuse me.
Why are you doing this?

37:00.975 --> 37:02.074
I think that's clear.

37:02.076 --> 37:03.710
Mr. Reilly,

37:03.712 --> 37:04.944
do you think
you really have a case?

37:04.946 --> 37:06.281
I'm not even gonna answer that.

37:08.716 --> 37:10.350
What's the matter?

37:10.352 --> 37:12.020
That's.
That's the guy from the picture.

37:12.386 --> 37:14.055
- No, no. That's the guy.
- Come on.

37:15.991 --> 37:17.026
Hey!

37:17.993 --> 37:19.091
- Oh, excuse me.
- Ma'am, excuse me.

37:19.093 --> 37:21.060
- Can you answer more questions
- Excuse me. Let me...

37:21.062 --> 37:22.197
- about the case, please.
- Excuse me.

37:39.013 --> 37:41.182
He got away.
He ran up an alley.

37:41.950 --> 37:43.016
- We'll get him.
- Mm-mmm.

37:43.018 --> 37:43.986
Let's sit.

37:49.658 --> 37:51.759
Will the counsel
please approach the bench?

37:56.897 --> 37:58.200
Did we work anything out?

37:59.401 --> 38:00.301
Yeah.

38:01.035 --> 38:02.171
Okay, let's go.

38:04.138 --> 38:07.073
On the docket this morning
is a hearing on a 12B6 motion

38:07.075 --> 38:10.342
to dismiss filed
by the defendants.

38:10.344 --> 38:12.948
A motion, uh, Monsignor,
it's your motion.

38:14.015 --> 38:16.815
Your Honor, it is our position
that the plaintiff is attempting

38:16.817 --> 38:18.317
to insert the government

38:18.319 --> 38:20.823
into the defendant's
religious practices,

38:21.022 --> 38:23.022
which has no precedent
in American law.

38:23.024 --> 38:25.158
Uh, even if
the Church's protection

38:25.160 --> 38:27.125
under the first amendment

38:27.127 --> 38:30.999
would cause the infringement
of the plaintiff's equal rights.

38:31.366 --> 38:33.433
Your Honor,
enforcing her rights,

38:33.435 --> 38:35.201
would infringe upon
the Catholic Church's rights

38:35.203 --> 38:36.902
under the Constitution.

38:36.904 --> 38:39.138
Is it your opinion
that the Civil Rights Act

38:39.140 --> 38:40.806
is unconstitutional?

38:40.808 --> 38:42.243
No, Your Honor, not the Act.

38:42.743 --> 38:45.213
But the application of the Act
in this instance,

38:45.446 --> 38:47.179
would be.

38:47.181 --> 38:48.281
Do you have
anything else, Monsignor?

38:48.283 --> 38:49.284
No, your Honor.

38:49.817 --> 38:51.183
Mr. Reilly, it's your turn.

38:52.821 --> 38:54.721
Your Honor,
there is no question

38:54.723 --> 38:56.955
that the Catholic Church
is discriminating against women

38:56.957 --> 38:59.424
by allowing admission
to a Catholic seminary to only,

38:59.426 --> 39:02.728
and I quote, "unmarried males
who have been baptized

39:02.730 --> 39:04.366
and confirmed
in the Catholic faith."

39:05.265 --> 39:07.301
This is discrimination
on its face.

39:07.801 --> 39:11.471
Maybe, but does the government
have a right to get involved

39:11.473 --> 39:12.975
in their religion?

39:13.274 --> 39:15.942
Your Honor, federal courts
assume jurisdiction

39:15.944 --> 39:17.509
over the Church
of the Latter Day Saints

39:17.511 --> 39:20.446
regarding their religious right
to polygamy.

39:20.448 --> 39:22.482
The courts ruled
that the civil laws

39:22.484 --> 39:24.884
against polygamy outweigh
the church's right

39:24.886 --> 39:26.755
to the practice
under the first amendment.

39:27.221 --> 39:28.457
There is no difference here.

39:30.158 --> 39:31.694
Are you finished, Mr. Reilly?

39:31.960 --> 39:32.895
Yes, Your Honor.

39:35.196 --> 39:38.964
Our forefathers drafted
some of the most poignant words

39:38.966 --> 39:42.437
when they said,
"All men are created equal."

39:43.071 --> 39:45.871
Unfortunately,
it did not include

39:45.873 --> 39:48.009
men of color or women.

39:48.442 --> 39:50.375
But as times change,

39:50.377 --> 39:53.748
so must our interpretation
of how those words were drafted.

39:54.248 --> 39:56.248
To do that,
we look no further

39:56.250 --> 39:58.352
than the Civil Rights Act
of 1964,

39:58.986 --> 40:02.123
which overturned our
forefathers' original intent.

40:02.556 --> 40:06.391
So, now the words
"all men are created equal",

40:06.393 --> 40:08.330
includes all men.

40:10.031 --> 40:13.000
But that legislation also
accomplished something else.

40:14.067 --> 40:16.305
To include women.

40:17.538 --> 40:20.473
Since there is ample
precedent to assume jurisdiction

40:20.475 --> 40:24.009
over the defendants
and a fact question exists,

40:24.011 --> 40:26.511
I hereby deny
the motion to dismiss.

40:28.049 --> 40:29.882
Quiet
in the courtroom.

40:29.884 --> 40:31.453
I'm prepared
to set this case for trial.

40:33.520 --> 40:35.189
Quiet in the courtroom!

40:38.292 --> 40:40.194
Keep it up
and I'll put everybody out.

40:40.562 --> 40:42.261
Your Honor,
we take exception

40:42.263 --> 40:45.033
as this is an issue
of first impression.

40:45.299 --> 40:46.966
Exception noted.

40:46.968 --> 40:49.301
Mr. Reilly, you recognize
that this court

40:49.303 --> 40:53.071
will have the right to determine
whether a mandatory injunction

40:53.073 --> 40:54.776
is justified?

40:55.042 --> 40:57.576
Even if the jury determines
that the defendant's actions

40:57.578 --> 40:58.946
are not justified.

40:59.413 --> 41:01.446
Yes, Your Honor.

41:01.448 --> 41:03.583
Then this case is set
for trial 9 a.m. next Tuesday.

41:03.585 --> 41:05.250
Due to the novelty of the case

41:05.252 --> 41:07.620
and the disruption
in the court today,

41:07.622 --> 41:11.857
these courtroom proceedings
will be closed to the public.

41:20.468 --> 41:22.268
Excuse me,

41:22.270 --> 41:24.136
Mr. Dunbar, do you know
how much Tommy wants?

41:24.138 --> 41:26.272
Please. Please, sir.
Just a comment would be great.

41:26.274 --> 41:29.007
Do you have anything to say
about your personal stance?

41:29.009 --> 41:30.509
What about Ms. Batista?

41:33.080 --> 41:35.214
- I know what you're saying.
- Great work y'all.

41:35.216 --> 41:36.982
Great job.

41:36.984 --> 41:39.086
A lot of hard work to do
and a tough road ahead.

41:39.620 --> 41:41.219
But here's to Ally.

41:41.221 --> 41:42.487
- To Ally.
- Yeah.

41:42.489 --> 41:43.859
I'm ready.

41:44.625 --> 41:46.525
Tommy, your mother's here.

41:46.527 --> 41:48.096
How dare you?

41:49.397 --> 41:51.330
In your whole life, you never
made a commitment to any woman.

41:51.332 --> 41:52.498
Why now?

41:52.500 --> 41:54.436
Mrs. Reilly, I'm Alejandra.

41:55.002 --> 41:57.036
If you're gonna be mad
at anyone, be mad at me.

41:57.038 --> 41:58.370
Mr. Reilly's just doing his job.

41:58.372 --> 42:00.339
You have no right to do this.

42:00.341 --> 42:03.208
No disrespect,
but I not only have the right,

42:03.210 --> 42:04.312
I have the obligation.

42:05.113 --> 42:06.245
Mom.

42:10.685 --> 42:12.988
That is just the tip
of the iceberg.

42:14.689 --> 42:16.457
Ms. Batista, excuse us, please.

42:22.397 --> 42:25.397
Our clients, our paying clients,
are too frightened to come here,

42:25.399 --> 42:27.433
because of the rowdy protesters.

42:27.435 --> 42:29.335
I thought you'd be pleased that
we were set for a two-day trial.

42:29.337 --> 42:30.572
Two days more than I wanted.

42:33.341 --> 42:34.375
Clean this up.

42:50.223 --> 42:52.493
I don't wanna cause you
any grieve with your family.

42:54.728 --> 42:56.131
It's God's will, right?

43:07.341 --> 43:08.373
What the hell is this?

43:18.618 --> 43:20.321
Oh my God.
It's him.

43:22.223 --> 43:23.158
Jesus.

43:28.730 --> 43:29.631
It's okay.

43:55.256 --> 43:56.455
- You okay?
- Yeah.

43:56.457 --> 43:57.692
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

44:02.663 --> 44:03.598
Yeah.

44:07.100 --> 44:08.002
He's gone.

44:09.370 --> 44:10.372
Oh, thank God.

44:18.513 --> 44:20.112
Oh my God.
What happened, mija?

44:20.114 --> 44:21.679
I'm okay, mama.

44:21.681 --> 44:23.181
No, you aren't.
You had an accident.

44:23.183 --> 44:24.319
Mr. Reilly,

44:24.551 --> 44:26.187
my daughter's life
is in your hands.

44:26.421 --> 44:29.091
And you're doing
a very lousy job protecting her.

44:30.290 --> 44:31.690
I know, sir.

44:31.692 --> 44:33.259
I've already gotten
more security.

44:33.261 --> 44:34.627
Do you see what
you've gotten yourself into,

44:34.629 --> 44:35.795
Alejandra?

44:35.797 --> 44:37.299
I'm sorry, papa.

44:51.779 --> 44:54.346
Mr. Reilly.
You may call your first witness.

44:55.415 --> 44:57.482
I call Dr. Sylvia Touran.

44:57.484 --> 44:59.752
Your Honor, Dr. Touran
is a licensed psychiatrist

44:59.754 --> 45:01.786
in the state of Louisiana.

45:01.788 --> 45:03.788
Defense counsel acknowledges
that she is used by the Diocese

45:03.790 --> 45:05.491
in interviewing applicants
to the seminary.

45:05.493 --> 45:07.292
I respectfully request

45:07.294 --> 45:08.396
that she's entered
in this court as an expert.

45:08.728 --> 45:10.232
Granted.

45:10.564 --> 45:13.098
Dr. Touran, would you please
describe the process

45:13.100 --> 45:15.269
by which you examine applicants
to the seminary?

45:15.636 --> 45:17.203
We're looking
for two qualities:

45:17.205 --> 45:18.603
The absence of pathology

45:18.605 --> 45:20.475
and the presence
of good mental health.

45:20.808 --> 45:22.841
We try to do this
in a face to face interview

45:22.843 --> 45:24.609
and by written examinations.

45:24.611 --> 45:26.112
Let's start
with the interview first.

45:26.114 --> 45:27.645
What are some questions you ask?

45:27.647 --> 45:29.882
We ask about
past sexual experiences.

45:29.884 --> 45:33.055
Such as, "When was
the last time you had sex?"

45:33.254 --> 45:35.386
Three years or more
is the preferred answer.

45:35.388 --> 45:37.455
Last night, not so good.

45:37.457 --> 45:39.225
And what about
some of the other examinations?

45:39.227 --> 45:41.726
All candidates
must take an HIV test...

45:41.728 --> 45:44.295
and a number
of written examinations.

45:44.297 --> 45:45.897
Based upon
your interview

45:45.899 --> 45:47.735
and written examination
of Alejandra Batista,

45:48.502 --> 45:50.402
did you form an opinion
about her fitness

45:50.404 --> 45:51.739
to be an applicant
to the seminary?

45:52.172 --> 45:53.705
Yes, I did.

45:53.707 --> 45:55.540
And what is
that opinion, Dr. Touran?

45:55.542 --> 45:57.743
That she would be
a tremendous candidate

45:57.745 --> 45:59.214
to the seminary.

46:00.381 --> 46:01.880
No further questions,
Your Honor.

46:01.882 --> 46:03.415
Monsignor Renzulli.

46:03.417 --> 46:04.853
Dr. Touran, are you Catholic?

46:05.252 --> 46:06.851
Yes, I am.

46:06.853 --> 46:08.520
As a Catholic and a woman,
what is your opinion

46:08.522 --> 46:09.888
on whether a woman
should be a priest?

46:09.890 --> 46:12.324
I don't have an opinion.

46:12.759 --> 46:14.560
Surely in your work,

46:14.562 --> 46:15.861
you've witnessed discrimination
against women.

46:15.863 --> 46:17.596
- Is that true?
- Yes.

46:17.598 --> 46:18.630
Is the field
in which you work

46:18.632 --> 46:20.199
dominated by men?

46:20.201 --> 46:22.167
Mostly,
but it's getting better.

46:22.169 --> 46:24.536
As a woman who has succeeded
in a field dominated by men,

46:24.538 --> 46:25.904
you're telling this jury

46:25.906 --> 46:27.473
there's not just
a little part of you

46:27.475 --> 46:29.241
that wants this plaintiff
to succeed

46:29.243 --> 46:30.645
in her quest to be a priest?

46:35.382 --> 46:36.350
Dr. Touran?

46:38.852 --> 46:40.819
I like to see women succeed.

46:40.821 --> 46:41.589
Yes.

46:42.723 --> 46:44.392
No further questions,
Your Honor.

46:44.658 --> 46:47.292
- Mr. Reilly, redirect?
- No, Your Honor.

46:47.294 --> 46:50.929
This court will adjourn
for lunch until 2 p.m.

46:50.931 --> 46:53.399
at which time the plaintiff
will call their next witness.

46:53.401 --> 46:55.169
All rise.

47:13.955 --> 47:15.457
See you in the morning.

47:26.299 --> 47:27.699
You know,
I ask myself,

47:27.701 --> 47:28.837
what is the Church's
strategy here?

47:29.402 --> 47:31.370
I mean, hoping
for a motion to dismiss,

47:31.372 --> 47:33.371
obviously was not a strategy.

47:33.373 --> 47:35.377
We will win
this case on merits.

47:35.676 --> 47:38.310
Juries often have
a habit of interpreting merits

47:38.312 --> 47:39.877
in unexpected ways.

47:39.879 --> 47:41.482
Would you agree
the merits are on our side?

47:41.781 --> 47:43.450
I try never to think of merits.

47:43.783 --> 47:44.952
Only outcomes.

47:45.352 --> 47:46.421
Costs.

47:46.687 --> 47:47.788
Reputations.

47:48.321 --> 47:50.388
That way
I'm rarely disappointed.

47:50.390 --> 47:51.825
Do you have
a destination in mind?

47:52.759 --> 47:54.826
Where does
the church want to go

47:54.828 --> 47:56.931
with this unnecessary exercise?

47:57.397 --> 47:59.565
And let's have no talk
of winning and losing.

47:59.567 --> 48:02.204
The church will never
let Ms. Batista be a priest.

48:02.937 --> 48:04.205
Too bad, really.

48:05.372 --> 48:07.772
- A highly qualified candidate.
- But she's not qualified.

48:07.774 --> 48:09.643
I must represent
the Church's doctrine.

48:09.843 --> 48:11.676
That's not what I'm really
trying to get at.

48:11.678 --> 48:13.814
I was thinking more of a number

48:14.015 --> 48:16.850
with more than
a handful of zeros.

48:21.656 --> 48:22.623
Possibly.

48:23.424 --> 48:24.890
What about the girl?

48:24.892 --> 48:25.926
Bigger obstacle.

48:26.493 --> 48:27.796
Perhaps not hopeless.

48:29.462 --> 48:31.397
If we're agreed,
I'll inform Judge Watford

48:31.399 --> 48:32.901
of the possibility
of a settlement.

48:53.386 --> 48:57.589
This court will adjourn
until Monday morning at 9 a.m.

49:00.794 --> 49:02.463
Uh, Your Honor, may,
may we know why?

49:02.663 --> 49:03.898
Uh, Your Honor, may...

49:13.073 --> 49:14.408
That's okay.

49:16.076 --> 49:17.578
That's okay.

49:27.120 --> 49:28.989
- Hey, baby.
- Hey, Tommy.

49:31.058 --> 49:33.762
Look, Nick,
I thought about what you said.

49:34.361 --> 49:35.329
And you're right.

49:38.098 --> 49:39.566
I'm so sorry.

49:40.901 --> 49:41.902
I do need you.

49:42.703 --> 49:43.672
Hey, Nick?

49:47.475 --> 49:48.476
Sorry, Tommy.

49:53.080 --> 49:54.049
Come in.

50:01.154 --> 50:03.422
- Where's Tommy?
- He'll follow up.

50:03.424 --> 50:05.022
Ms. Batista, may I sit down?

50:07.395 --> 50:08.596
How have you been?

50:12.799 --> 50:17.339
Faith by itself, if it does not
have works, is dead.

50:18.672 --> 50:21.676
I believe that's James
chapter two verse 14.

50:22.109 --> 50:23.708
If you look in your heart,

50:23.710 --> 50:25.176
you'll appreciate
all the wonderful things

50:25.178 --> 50:27.047
you can provide
for those in need.

50:28.848 --> 50:30.716
But I could not be a priest.

50:30.718 --> 50:32.620
That's the one thing
you have to give up.

50:33.853 --> 50:35.453
And if it makes a difference,

50:35.455 --> 50:37.591
I believe you can get
several million.

50:39.960 --> 50:42.761
It's interesting that the church
would be willing to spend

50:42.763 --> 50:45.100
millions of dollars that,
as you suggest,

50:45.533 --> 50:47.065
could be spent helping others,

50:47.067 --> 50:48.870
just to keep one woman
out of the seminary.

50:50.171 --> 50:51.837
No, no, I'm not saying

50:51.839 --> 50:53.641
this offer's being made
by the church.

50:54.007 --> 50:56.007
But let's say,
there are individuals

50:56.009 --> 50:59.747
interested in making
this situation go away.

51:04.585 --> 51:06.988
<i>We're gonna settle.
Renzulli's on board.</i>

51:09.924 --> 51:12.761
I can't believe you went to
Renzulli behind my back. -Mmm.

51:13.460 --> 51:14.926
That's of no importance.

51:14.928 --> 51:16.862
What is important,
is that win or lose,

51:16.864 --> 51:19.565
Ms. Batista's gonna be
a novelty the rest of her life.

51:19.567 --> 51:21.065
You wanna help that girl,

51:21.067 --> 51:23.103
help her walk away
with millions of dollars.

51:24.504 --> 51:26.039
She'll never go for it.

51:26.841 --> 51:28.910
You never know
how someone will respond

51:29.243 --> 51:31.042
till you ask the right question.

51:35.582 --> 51:36.917
You talked to her.

51:39.652 --> 51:40.788
You disappoint me.

51:42.890 --> 51:44.589
What the hell happened to you?

51:44.591 --> 51:46.960
We don't deal
in good guys and bad guys.

51:48.094 --> 51:49.795
She stuck to her guns

51:49.797 --> 51:50.929
that happens to be
worth a lot of money.

51:50.931 --> 51:51.900
Get it done.

51:52.933 --> 51:54.600
Or forget about being partner.

52:08.515 --> 52:11.118
- I don't care about the money.
- Really?

52:11.685 --> 52:13.118
What about all the good

52:13.120 --> 52:15.056
that you could do
with millions of dollars?

52:15.288 --> 52:17.825
Isn't that a little selfish?
Maybe even a sin?

52:20.194 --> 52:23.629
That which God had made me do,
had commanded or shall command,

52:23.631 --> 52:25.763
I will not fail to do
for any man alive.

52:25.765 --> 52:26.964
You know,
I never learned that one.

52:26.966 --> 52:28.169
- Is it Matthew?
- No.

52:28.868 --> 52:31.103
It's from Joan of Arc
to her interrogators.

52:31.105 --> 52:34.476
Is this about vanity?
Are you bucking for sainthood?

52:34.774 --> 52:37.177
What do you believe in
when you're alone in the quiet?

52:40.647 --> 52:41.716
Making partner?

52:42.216 --> 52:43.484
Then what?

52:44.486 --> 52:46.154
Dispiriting sex
with the next random woman?

52:48.656 --> 52:51.993
If you take away faith,
you take away the magic of life.

52:52.893 --> 52:54.896
I'd rather die
than live that way.

52:55.995 --> 52:57.198
I believe in something.

52:57.964 --> 52:59.167
I believe in the law,

53:00.267 --> 53:01.866
which is why I took your case.

53:01.868 --> 53:03.167
Dunbar shoved my case
down your throat

53:03.169 --> 53:05.103
hoping you'd settle it.

53:05.105 --> 53:06.608
We both know this case
was never gonna settle.

53:07.341 --> 53:08.276
But I'm here.

53:09.076 --> 53:10.011
Why?

53:12.011 --> 53:13.714
What do you believe in, Tommy?

53:19.919 --> 53:21.154
What do I believe in?

53:26.192 --> 53:27.160
I don't know.

53:31.864 --> 53:33.234
Maybe I'm just hard headed.

53:34.801 --> 53:36.169
You may be a little hard headed.

53:37.770 --> 53:40.007
But you're definitely not
hard hearted.

Hello?

55:06.160 --> 55:07.629
Hey, Ally, it's me.

55:08.828 --> 55:09.763
Okay.

55:10.763 --> 55:11.798
Let's do this.

55:22.710 --> 55:24.275
- Sister Jean?
- Yes?

55:24.277 --> 55:26.279
Willis Thompkins.
We spoke on the phone earlier.

55:27.013 --> 55:29.082
Yes.
Please, come have a seat.

55:34.888 --> 55:36.221
I've been thinking about

55:36.223 --> 55:37.922
the sketch that you sent me,

55:37.924 --> 55:39.924
and I do think it's Mr. Vargas.

55:39.926 --> 55:40.995
What is his first name?

55:41.194 --> 55:43.094
Vick.

55:43.096 --> 55:45.265
Sister, please tell me
everything you know about him.

55:45.732 --> 55:47.435
- Well, he lives down the street.
- Where?

55:48.167 --> 55:51.002
The Quartermain apartments
on Poydras.

55:51.004 --> 55:53.040
He used to come
to church regularly.

55:53.372 --> 55:54.408
But not anymore.

55:55.241 --> 55:56.910
He tried for the seminary.

55:58.111 --> 55:59.680
But wasn't accepted.

56:00.948 --> 56:02.984
He didn't handle it
very well, you know.

56:03.283 --> 56:07.018
Mm-hmm. Thank you, Sister.
That was very helpful.

56:07.020 --> 56:08.386
Thank you.

56:08.388 --> 56:09.390
You're welcome
and God bless you.

57:06.946 --> 57:08.547
Are you the landlord here?

57:08.549 --> 57:10.218
- Why?
- Is this where Vick Vargas lives?

57:10.917 --> 57:12.449
Who wants to know?

57:12.451 --> 57:13.551
I'm an investigative attorney.
Is he here?

57:15.254 --> 57:16.890
Can you give me
a key to his room?

57:17.223 --> 57:18.158
No.

57:35.107 --> 57:37.310
Second floor.
Last door on the left.

58:37.671 --> 58:38.471
Hey, Tommy.

58:39.506 --> 58:41.906
Yeah,
I got some great news.

58:41.908 --> 58:43.540
<i>I could use that.</i>

58:43.542 --> 58:46.046
Our guy, he lives across
the street from the church.

58:46.279 --> 58:48.480
Yeah, one of the sisters
recognized him.

58:48.482 --> 58:50.348
<i>Under our noses
the whole time.</i>

58:50.350 --> 58:52.420
I'm in his apartment
right now. Hold on.

58:57.957 --> 58:59.860
This dude is Four Loko.

59:00.627 --> 59:03.364
Got Ally's face plastered
all over his walls.

59:04.297 --> 59:07.198
Only one problem, he's MIA.

59:07.200 --> 59:09.035
- <i>Find him.</i>
- I'm on it.

59:10.404 --> 59:12.170
Yeah well, I'm about
to call the cops.

59:12.172 --> 59:13.908
I'm just gonna stay here
till they arrive.

59:14.140 --> 59:16.042
There's tons of stuff
to sift through.

59:17.143 --> 59:20.247
Tommy, be careful
in the meantime.

59:33.125 --> 59:34.261
You're fired.

59:35.363 --> 59:37.364
Jane, take over
and let's get this settled.

59:37.631 --> 59:39.333
This case is bigger
than you and me.

59:39.598 --> 59:42.266
I'd like to continue to
represent Ms. Batista by myself.

59:42.268 --> 59:45.069
If that's okay with you, Ally?
I'd like to proceed.

59:45.071 --> 59:47.642
Most certainly.
Mr. Dunbar, you're fired.

59:53.446 --> 59:54.381
Jane.

01:00:06.125 --> 01:00:07.160
Ms. Batista.

01:00:08.261 --> 01:00:10.328
Did you apply to the
Archdiocese of New Orleans

01:00:10.330 --> 01:00:12.596
- to attend the seminary?
- Yes, I did.

01:00:12.598 --> 01:00:14.134
Did they accept
your application?

01:00:14.468 --> 01:00:15.533
They did not.

01:00:15.535 --> 01:00:16.703
Did they say why?

01:00:17.236 --> 01:00:20.270
I was told I didn't meet
the basic qualifications

01:00:20.272 --> 01:00:21.341
for an applicant.

01:00:21.540 --> 01:00:24.009
What are
the basic qualifications?

01:00:24.011 --> 01:00:26.076
An applicant
must be a non-married male,

01:00:26.078 --> 01:00:29.080
baptized and confirmed
in the Catholic Church.

01:00:29.082 --> 01:00:31.248
Are you married
or have you ever been married?

01:00:31.250 --> 01:00:33.051
- No.
- Are you a Catholic,

01:00:33.053 --> 01:00:34.989
baptized and confirmed
in the Catholic Church?

01:00:35.254 --> 01:00:37.054
- Yes, I am.
- So, the only reason

01:00:37.056 --> 01:00:39.257
your application to attend
seminary was denied,

01:00:39.259 --> 01:00:40.658
is because you are not male.

01:00:40.660 --> 01:00:42.359
- Is that correct?
- Objection.

01:00:42.361 --> 01:00:44.161
Question calls for a conclusion

01:00:44.163 --> 01:00:45.730
of the witness not within
her scope of knowledge.

01:00:45.732 --> 01:00:47.301
Mmm. Sustained.

01:00:48.468 --> 01:00:49.502
Ms. Batista.

01:00:50.736 --> 01:00:52.539
Could you tell the court
why you want to be a priest?

01:00:53.205 --> 01:00:55.339
I believe
it is my calling in life.

01:00:55.341 --> 01:00:58.143
Whenever I expressed
that feeling, I was told,

01:00:58.145 --> 01:01:00.114
"You can't be a priest.
You're a girl."

01:01:00.647 --> 01:01:02.212
I never understood.

01:01:02.214 --> 01:01:04.049
I am caring and committed

01:01:04.051 --> 01:01:05.987
to the teachings
of the Catholic Church.

01:01:06.719 --> 01:01:08.355
As I've grown older,

01:01:08.587 --> 01:01:10.288
that calling became stronger

01:01:10.290 --> 01:01:12.493
and I know that I have
the spirituality,

01:01:13.060 --> 01:01:15.062
the desire to help others.

01:01:16.263 --> 01:01:18.632
And the dedication
to do God's work.

01:01:21.567 --> 01:01:22.602
Ms. Batista.

01:01:24.203 --> 01:01:26.774
Do you honestly feel that God
wants you to be a priest?

01:01:27.707 --> 01:01:30.308
Objection.
Ms. Batista cannot possibly know

01:01:30.310 --> 01:01:31.478
what is in the mind of God.

01:01:31.710 --> 01:01:33.411
Overruled.

01:01:33.413 --> 01:01:35.549
Ms. Batista,
you may answer the question.

01:01:36.415 --> 01:01:37.517
Yes.

01:01:37.783 --> 01:01:39.219
I firmly believe,

01:01:39.618 --> 01:01:43.089
as firmly as I believe
in the Catholic faith,

01:01:43.422 --> 01:01:45.558
that this calling
comes from God.

01:01:49.395 --> 01:01:50.797
No further questions,
Your Honor.

01:01:51.198 --> 01:01:52.600
Monsignor Renzulli.

01:01:56.402 --> 01:01:59.607
Ms. Batista,
if you are ordained as a priest,

01:02:00.406 --> 01:02:02.306
are you aware
that you will take a vow

01:02:02.308 --> 01:02:04.708
to obey all of the teachings
of the Catholic Church?

01:02:04.710 --> 01:02:06.346
I am aware of that vow.

01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:08.580
And are you aware
that the church teaches

01:02:08.582 --> 01:02:11.850
that only males may be
validly ordained as priests?

01:02:11.852 --> 01:02:13.054
Yes, Monsignor.

01:02:13.252 --> 01:02:15.185
Do you believe in the doctrine

01:02:15.187 --> 01:02:16.656
concerning
the gender of priests?

01:02:17.156 --> 01:02:18.857
No, I do not.

01:02:18.859 --> 01:02:21.661
Then, how can you,
in all good conscience,

01:02:22.261 --> 01:02:24.728
take the vow to obey
all the teachings of the church,

01:02:24.730 --> 01:02:26.397
when you do not believe
in the validity

01:02:26.399 --> 01:02:28.500
of one of
the church's basic doctrines?

01:02:28.502 --> 01:02:30.571
Monsignor,
if I'm ordained as a priest,

01:02:30.837 --> 01:02:33.507
I would be both a woman
and an ordained priest.

01:02:34.473 --> 01:02:36.574
That means the doctrine
of male only priests

01:02:36.576 --> 01:02:37.678
is no longer taught.

01:02:38.844 --> 01:02:40.444
I could readily take a vow

01:02:40.446 --> 01:02:42.549
to obey
all church doctrines then.

01:02:44.151 --> 01:02:46.252
Ms. Batista,
there's been a good bit of...

01:02:46.785 --> 01:02:49.786
notoriety about your lawsuit.

01:02:49.788 --> 01:02:51.823
- Wouldn't you agree?
- Yes, I would.

01:02:51.825 --> 01:02:54.292
It might make one
wonder how sincere you are

01:02:54.294 --> 01:02:55.826
about your desire to be a priest

01:02:55.828 --> 01:02:57.228
or whether you are
just seeking publicity.

01:02:57.230 --> 01:02:59.263
Objection.

01:02:59.265 --> 01:03:01.232
Counsel isn't asking questions.
He's lecturing the witness.

01:03:01.234 --> 01:03:02.266
Sustained.

01:03:02.268 --> 01:03:03.835
Monsignor Renzulli,

01:03:03.837 --> 01:03:07.373
please confine
your examination to questions.

01:03:08.942 --> 01:03:11.475
You've testified that you've had
the calling to be a priest

01:03:11.477 --> 01:03:13.377
since you were a child.

01:03:13.379 --> 01:03:15.212
And you feel
that this calling is from God.

01:03:15.214 --> 01:03:16.649
- Correct?
- Yes.

01:03:17.417 --> 01:03:19.449
Why has it taken
so long to apply?

01:03:19.451 --> 01:03:21.221
As you can see, Monsignor,

01:03:22.556 --> 01:03:24.325
this is a difficult process.

01:03:26.359 --> 01:03:28.792
I'm not a person
who seeks media attention.

01:03:28.794 --> 01:03:30.761
Knowing what was coming,

01:03:30.763 --> 01:03:33.600
I prayed long and hard
and looked into my heart...

01:03:33.966 --> 01:03:35.435
to determine if...

01:03:36.268 --> 01:03:38.571
by God's grace I could apply
to the seminary.

01:03:39.506 --> 01:03:42.207
Do you believe that
by challenging God's church,

01:03:42.209 --> 01:03:43.676
you are in His Grace?

01:03:44.210 --> 01:03:45.976
If I'm not,
may God put me there.

01:03:45.978 --> 01:03:48.281
And if I am, may God so keep me.

01:03:51.817 --> 01:03:52.886
Ms. Batista,

01:03:53.988 --> 01:03:57.989
are you aware that there are
many Christian religions

01:03:57.991 --> 01:03:59.656
who would readily take someone

01:03:59.658 --> 01:04:01.792
who is as dedicated
as you say you are

01:04:01.794 --> 01:04:04.330
to be a priest or a minister?

01:04:04.730 --> 01:04:06.797
- Yes.
- Then why did you not apply

01:04:06.799 --> 01:04:09.366
to an Episcopal,
or another seminary,

01:04:09.368 --> 01:04:13.337
instead of filing a lawsuit
against the Catholic Church?

01:04:13.339 --> 01:04:14.807
Because I'm a Catholic.

01:04:15.808 --> 01:04:18.645
And I wish to become
a Catholic priest.

01:04:37.529 --> 01:04:40.234
You know Dunbar gonna lose it
if he know I was here. Right?

01:04:40.634 --> 01:04:42.770
I've been up all night
searching Vargas' place.

01:04:43.335 --> 01:04:45.370
I really could use your help
on this one, brother.

01:04:45.372 --> 01:04:46.339
I got you.

01:04:47.306 --> 01:04:49.641
Anything for you, bro'.
Anything for Ally.

01:04:51.844 --> 01:04:53.781
Police.
They found something.

01:04:54.047 --> 01:04:55.416
I, I'm heading back there.

01:05:01.053 --> 01:05:01.955
Hey.

01:05:03.422 --> 01:05:04.922
- Hey, Tommy.
- I don't want that.

01:05:04.924 --> 01:05:06.227
Take the gun, Tommy.

01:05:14.868 --> 01:05:16.303
A gun, Tommy?

01:05:24.743 --> 01:05:26.379
The jury
really responded to you.

01:05:27.446 --> 01:05:29.681
They may not
understand your faith,

01:05:29.683 --> 01:05:31.819
but they appreciate
your passion for it.

01:05:32.852 --> 01:05:34.721
- Thank you.
- I mean it.

01:05:36.756 --> 01:05:38.556
Do you really think
I can convince people

01:05:38.558 --> 01:05:41.027
who don't share my faith,
of what it means to me?

01:05:42.428 --> 01:05:43.564
You convinced me.

01:06:17.663 --> 01:06:18.732
What did you guys find?

01:06:23.102 --> 01:06:24.504
We gotta go.
Come on.

01:06:27.373 --> 01:06:29.005
Hey, Silk.

01:06:29.007 --> 01:06:30.408
<i>Hey, Tommy.
He knows where she is.</i>

01:06:30.410 --> 01:06:31.842
You gotta get out of there.

01:06:31.844 --> 01:06:33.044
I'm on my way.
Get out of there now!

01:06:34.980 --> 01:06:36.015
We need backup.

01:06:36.582 --> 01:06:37.681
Go! Let's go!

01:06:53.165 --> 01:06:54.067
Hey.

01:06:54.734 --> 01:06:55.900
We gotta get you outta here.

01:06:55.902 --> 01:06:56.937
Vargas knows where you are.

01:07:00.006 --> 01:07:01.875
It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

01:07:02.841 --> 01:07:03.743
It's okay.

01:07:07.446 --> 01:07:08.348
Ah!

01:07:12.852 --> 01:07:16.957
Shhh. Let's get out of here.

01:07:25.931 --> 01:07:28.035
Shhh.

01:08:25.925 --> 01:08:27.591
Don't move.

01:08:27.594 --> 01:08:29.093
When the wicked advanced
against me...

01:08:29.095 --> 01:08:30.727
Stay right there.

01:08:30.729 --> 01:08:32.662
...it will be
my enemies and foes...

01:08:32.665 --> 01:08:34.698
- Tommy, please don't shoot him.
- ...and those

01:08:34.701 --> 01:08:36.133
- who will stumble and fall.
- Tommy, please don't shoot him.

01:08:36.135 --> 01:08:37.634
- Ally, get the hell outta here.
- I can only be...

01:08:37.636 --> 01:08:38.537
- No! Don't!
- Stop.

01:08:39.138 --> 01:08:42.740
Help!

01:08:42.742 --> 01:08:43.540
- You must repent.
- Help!

01:08:43.542 --> 01:08:46.078
Help!

01:08:47.979 --> 01:08:51.615
I will force
you until you renounce your sins.

01:08:51.617 --> 01:08:53.754
And have begged God
for his forgiveness.

01:08:59.559 --> 01:09:00.857
- Look!
- Help!

01:09:15.974 --> 01:09:18.008
Hey! No, no, no, no.

01:09:18.010 --> 01:09:19.810
Hey, hey. Hey, come here.

01:09:19.812 --> 01:09:21.247
- Ally! Oh, Jesus!
- Tommy!

01:09:21.947 --> 01:09:23.712
- Wake up. Hey!
- Tommy!

01:09:23.715 --> 01:09:24.852
Oh God! Ally!

01:09:25.751 --> 01:09:27.520
- Jesus!
- Ally.

01:09:31.558 --> 01:09:32.589
Ally!

01:10:14.267 --> 01:10:15.903
Everything's gonna be all right.

01:10:17.170 --> 01:10:18.636
No.

01:10:18.638 --> 01:10:20.274
It's not ever gonna be
alright.

01:10:22.108 --> 01:10:23.276
We shouldn't be doing this.

01:10:25.979 --> 01:10:28.949
Maybe this is my punishment
for going against the church.

01:10:31.017 --> 01:10:32.816
Maybe this is God's will.

01:10:32.818 --> 01:10:34.587
No, Ally,
this is not God's will.

01:10:36.054 --> 01:10:39.292
This is the work
of a crazed lunatic.

01:10:44.096 --> 01:10:45.965
You're the bravest person
I ever met.

01:10:47.733 --> 01:10:48.865
Don't doubt yourself.

01:10:52.971 --> 01:10:54.174
You weren't wrong.

01:10:57.943 --> 01:10:58.978
We were wrong.

01:11:01.913 --> 01:11:03.750
It's okay. It's okay.

01:11:08.121 --> 01:11:09.656
I have to get ready for court.

01:11:21.733 --> 01:11:23.901
I'm going to assume
that you've heard

01:11:23.903 --> 01:11:26.771
that the plaintiff,
Alejandra Batista,

01:11:26.773 --> 01:11:28.071
had a horrific night.

01:11:28.073 --> 01:11:29.973
Luckily, she is now in recovery.

01:11:29.975 --> 01:11:32.776
The man who abducted her
is a psychotic individual

01:11:32.778 --> 01:11:36.012
who had no affiliation
whatsoever

01:11:36.014 --> 01:11:38.115
with the defendants
in this case.

01:11:38.117 --> 01:11:40.787
Do you understand this?
If so, please say yes.

01:11:40.987 --> 01:11:42.953
- Yes, Your Honor.
- Good.

01:11:42.955 --> 01:11:44.888
We will now continue
with this trial.

01:11:44.890 --> 01:11:48.359
Monsignor, are you ready
with your first witness?

01:11:48.361 --> 01:11:49.727
Yes, Your Honor.

01:11:49.729 --> 01:11:51.128
He's already been sworn?

01:11:51.130 --> 01:11:51.928
Yes, Your Honor.

01:11:51.930 --> 01:11:53.232
All right.
You may proceed.

01:11:55.968 --> 01:11:58.772
The defense calls
Bishop Cardinal Jose Sierra.

01:12:14.287 --> 01:12:17.722
Bishop Sierra,
why are unmarried women,

01:12:17.724 --> 01:12:19.423
baptized
in the Roman Catholic Church,

01:12:19.425 --> 01:12:21.758
not qualified
to become a priest?

01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:23.893
It has been the teaching
of the Roman Catholic Church

01:12:23.895 --> 01:12:26.866
since the time of Christ,
that all priests are male.

01:12:27.099 --> 01:12:29.133
Is there a direct
scriptural reference

01:12:29.135 --> 01:12:30.804
- for this teaching?
- No.

01:12:31.170 --> 01:12:32.973
What is the foundation
for this doctrine?

01:12:34.005 --> 01:12:37.341
Jesus chose only men
to be his disciples.

01:12:37.343 --> 01:12:40.410
We follow the example
he set 2,000 years ago.

01:12:40.412 --> 01:12:42.346
What were
the social conditions

01:12:42.348 --> 01:12:45.149
for a woman in Palestine
and Jerusalem

01:12:45.151 --> 01:12:46.851
during the time of Jesus?

01:12:46.853 --> 01:12:49.786
It was a male dominated society.

01:12:49.788 --> 01:12:51.957
Women were little more
than slaves.

01:12:52.157 --> 01:12:54.258
So, he was following
the social norms of the times,

01:12:54.260 --> 01:12:55.793
- correct?
- No.

01:12:55.795 --> 01:12:57.328
Why not?

01:12:57.330 --> 01:12:58.829
The priest
is the representative

01:12:58.831 --> 01:13:00.132
of Jesus on earth.

01:13:01.032 --> 01:13:02.368
Jesus was a man.

01:13:03.301 --> 01:13:04.837
Therefore, priests are men.

01:13:06.072 --> 01:13:08.709
Thank you, Bishop Sierra.
No further questions.

01:13:09.274 --> 01:13:10.810
Your witness, Mr. Reilly.

01:13:11.810 --> 01:13:12.879
Bishop Sierra.

01:13:13.946 --> 01:13:16.347
You said there's no direct
scriptural revelation

01:13:16.349 --> 01:13:18.082
to bar women
from the priesthood forever.

01:13:18.084 --> 01:13:19.784
Is that correct?

01:13:19.786 --> 01:13:22.288
In the context
in which I just stated it.

01:13:23.156 --> 01:13:24.989
Yes, that's correct.

01:13:24.991 --> 01:13:26.390
So, your testimony
is that the church relies upon

01:13:26.392 --> 01:13:28.092
what Jesus didn't do

01:13:28.094 --> 01:13:29.994
in appointing males only
as apostles.

01:13:29.996 --> 01:13:32.195
- Is that correct?
- Yes.

01:13:32.197 --> 01:13:34.030
If Jesus
was following the tradition

01:13:34.032 --> 01:13:37.737
of the tribes of Israel,
which had an all-male hierarchy,

01:13:37.937 --> 01:13:39.335
wouldn't it have made sense
to continue

01:13:39.337 --> 01:13:40.937
this all-male hierarchy

01:13:40.939 --> 01:13:42.442
in the appointing
of his apostles?

01:13:43.509 --> 01:13:45.276
Maybe.

01:13:45.278 --> 01:13:47.110
Let's talk about
some other social norms

01:13:47.112 --> 01:13:49.315
at the time that maybe
Jesus might have followed.

01:13:49.982 --> 01:13:51.852
All the apostles
probably wore beards, right?

01:13:52.184 --> 01:13:54.151
Yes?

01:13:54.153 --> 01:13:56.152
But because Jesus didn't
appoint any clean shaven men

01:13:56.154 --> 01:13:58.422
as apostles, that doesn't mean
the church now excludes them

01:13:58.424 --> 01:13:59.423
from becoming priests.

01:13:59.425 --> 01:14:00.527
- Does it?
- No.

01:14:01.460 --> 01:14:04.895
Beards were
an incidental characteristic

01:14:04.897 --> 01:14:07.134
- the apostles shared.
- Of course.

01:14:07.899 --> 01:14:09.566
It would be ridiculous

01:14:09.568 --> 01:14:11.470
to exclude men without beards
from the priesthood.

01:14:11.871 --> 01:14:14.373
All the first apostles
were also Jews, weren't they?

01:14:15.041 --> 01:14:16.476
Yes.

01:14:16.876 --> 01:14:18.342
Does the fact that he didn't
appoint any gentiles

01:14:18.344 --> 01:14:20.343
to be among the first apostles,

01:14:20.345 --> 01:14:22.512
mean that gentiles are barred
forever from the priesthood?

01:14:22.514 --> 01:14:24.347
No.

01:14:24.349 --> 01:14:26.217
When gentiles became
a larger part of the church,

01:14:26.219 --> 01:14:28.555
gentile men
were ordained as priests.

01:14:30.555 --> 01:14:32.858
I believe you also said...

01:14:33.326 --> 01:14:36.392
that it was a social custom
at the time to not appoint women

01:14:36.394 --> 01:14:39.062
to positions of leadership
since they were treated

01:14:39.064 --> 01:14:40.396
"merely better than slaves".

01:14:40.398 --> 01:14:42.232
Is that correct?

01:14:42.234 --> 01:14:45.035
In a male dominated society,
yes, that's correct.

01:14:45.037 --> 01:14:46.904
Now, the custom
of treating women

01:14:46.906 --> 01:14:50.074
just a little better than slaves
has changed over time.

01:14:50.076 --> 01:14:53.043
- Correct?
- It most certainly has.

01:14:53.045 --> 01:14:54.544
Bishop Sierra,

01:14:54.546 --> 01:14:55.945
I would like
to summarize your testimony

01:14:55.947 --> 01:14:57.513
so that the jury and I

01:14:57.515 --> 01:14:59.415
can make sure
that we understood you.

01:14:59.417 --> 01:15:01.121
Jesus had 12 apostles.

01:15:01.420 --> 01:15:04.521
All wore beards, all were Jews
and all were men.

01:15:04.523 --> 01:15:06.490
As social customs changed,

01:15:06.492 --> 01:15:09.293
the church decided that
all of those characteristics,

01:15:09.295 --> 01:15:11.864
except one, were merely
incidental to the priesthood.

01:15:12.130 --> 01:15:14.164
The male gender
being fundamental.

01:15:14.166 --> 01:15:16.633
Why was the gender
of the original apostles

01:15:16.635 --> 01:15:19.102
the only
fundamental characteristic?

01:15:19.104 --> 01:15:20.905
Weren't they all the result
of the social customs

01:15:20.907 --> 01:15:22.606
with the time which Jesus lived?

01:15:22.608 --> 01:15:23.543
No.

01:15:26.479 --> 01:15:28.678
Monsignor Renzulli
objected to a question

01:15:28.680 --> 01:15:31.181
that I asked Ms. Batista
about whether she knew

01:15:31.183 --> 01:15:33.182
if God wanted her
to be a priest.

01:15:33.184 --> 01:15:36.052
He said that there was
no possible way

01:15:36.054 --> 01:15:37.923
to know what was in God's mind.

01:15:38.224 --> 01:15:39.323
Yes, that's correct.

01:15:39.325 --> 01:15:40.894
So, I ask you,

01:15:41.126 --> 01:15:43.160
how can you and the men
of the Catholic Church

01:15:43.162 --> 01:15:45.361
possibly know
what's in the mind of God

01:15:45.363 --> 01:15:47.263
concerning the gender
of his priests?

01:15:47.265 --> 01:15:49.365
The Pope has declared
that the priesthood

01:15:49.367 --> 01:15:52.168
shall be limited
to the male gender

01:15:52.170 --> 01:15:55.105
on the clear example of Jesus.

01:15:55.107 --> 01:15:59.045
And that, Mr. Reilly,
is the will of God.

01:15:59.444 --> 01:16:02.014
So say you
and the men of the church.

01:16:03.416 --> 01:16:05.252
- But Jesus never said that.
- Objection.

01:16:05.483 --> 01:16:07.951
- Mr. Reilly is making a speech.
- Sustained.

01:16:07.953 --> 01:16:10.219
Uh, Bishop Sierra,
you have ordained married males,

01:16:10.221 --> 01:16:11.123
have you not?

01:16:11.389 --> 01:16:13.656
I'm not sure what you mean.

01:16:13.658 --> 01:16:15.592
Have you ordained
a married Episcopal priest

01:16:15.594 --> 01:16:17.230
into the priesthood
of the Catholic Church?

01:16:18.397 --> 01:16:20.396
- Yes.
- Well, don't the qualifications

01:16:20.398 --> 01:16:22.635
for the priesthood require
the candidates to be unmarried?

01:16:23.336 --> 01:16:26.436
The Pope has offered
a special dispensation

01:16:26.438 --> 01:16:29.573
to ordain
married Episcopal priests

01:16:29.575 --> 01:16:31.577
when circumstances warrant it.

01:16:32.243 --> 01:16:33.744
The Episcopalian religion

01:16:33.746 --> 01:16:35.681
also ordains female priests,
does it not?

01:16:36.247 --> 01:16:37.414
Yes, I think they do.

01:16:37.416 --> 01:16:39.316
Will the Catholic Church

01:16:39.318 --> 01:16:41.288
ordain a female priest
of the Episcopalian religion?

01:16:41.754 --> 01:16:43.355
Married or unmarried?

01:16:43.621 --> 01:16:44.556
No.

01:16:45.523 --> 01:16:47.324
So, it is your testimony

01:16:47.326 --> 01:16:49.325
that you and the Pope
and the other cardinals

01:16:49.327 --> 01:16:53.196
will bend the rules to ordain
a married male Episcopal priest,

01:16:53.198 --> 01:16:56.133
but you will not bend
those same rules for a woman

01:16:56.135 --> 01:17:00.003
under the same circumstances
just because she is a woman?

01:17:00.005 --> 01:17:01.373
- Your Honor, please.
- Never mind.

01:17:02.174 --> 01:17:03.343
I withdraw my question.

01:17:05.044 --> 01:17:06.313
We already know your answer.

01:17:11.450 --> 01:17:13.185
No further questions,
Your Honor.

01:17:13.486 --> 01:17:16.652
This court will adjourn
until tomorrow morning at 9 a.m.

01:17:16.654 --> 01:17:20.192
when we will hear
closing arguments.

01:17:27.265 --> 01:17:29.169
I have God's mercy on my side.

01:18:15.680 --> 01:18:16.750
<i>Mr. Reilly,</i>

01:18:17.649 --> 01:18:19.085
your closing argument.

01:18:20.152 --> 01:18:23.223
It is with sadness
and outrage for me,

01:18:24.189 --> 01:18:25.722
that my client,
Alejandra Batista,

01:18:25.724 --> 01:18:28.691
would be abducted,
tortured and persecuted,

01:18:28.693 --> 01:18:31.730
simply because she had a call
to do good in the world.

01:18:32.564 --> 01:18:34.267
But you,
the members of the jury,

01:18:34.767 --> 01:18:37.470
have an opportunity
to right those terrible wrongs.

01:18:38.104 --> 01:18:43.810
And to pave way for something
that is right and natural.

01:18:44.376 --> 01:18:47.346
You've heard testimony
that church dogma is infallible.

01:18:47.712 --> 01:18:50.683
One dogma, is that men and women
are created equal.

01:18:51.250 --> 01:18:54.621
Another,
is that only men can be priests.

01:18:55.287 --> 01:18:56.823
Those dogmas
contradict each other.

01:18:57.355 --> 01:18:59.626
What are we supposed to believe?

01:19:00.291 --> 01:19:03.262
I believe
the evidence is so clear...

01:19:04.162 --> 01:19:06.396
that the only answer
to the question,

01:19:06.398 --> 01:19:09.665
"Do the defendants discriminate
solely based on gender?",

01:19:09.667 --> 01:19:12.572
is a resounding yes.

01:19:12.871 --> 01:19:15.405
And to the question,
"Do the defendants

01:19:15.407 --> 01:19:17.673
have justifiable cause
to discriminate?",

01:19:17.675 --> 01:19:20.813
is a resounding no.

01:19:21.714 --> 01:19:23.082
As a little girl,

01:19:23.648 --> 01:19:26.518
Alejandra Batista dreamed
of being a priest.

01:19:26.785 --> 01:19:28.822
But the men
of the Catholic Church

01:19:29.220 --> 01:19:31.390
have decided that
she can't pursue her dream.

01:19:31.890 --> 01:19:34.294
That no woman can
ever be a priest.

01:19:34.626 --> 01:19:36.161
No matter how qualified,

01:19:36.428 --> 01:19:38.695
or how committed she is,

01:19:38.697 --> 01:19:41.167
to the Catholic Church
and to God.

01:19:41.466 --> 01:19:44.871
Let Alejandra Batista
have her dream.

01:19:50.576 --> 01:19:53.446
Monsignor Renzulli,
you may address the jury.

01:19:56.549 --> 01:19:57.783
Thank you, Your Honor.

01:20:02.755 --> 01:20:05.722
In order for you
to find that my clients

01:20:05.724 --> 01:20:08.128
discriminate against women,

01:20:08.928 --> 01:20:11.695
you have to believe
that the evidence shows

01:20:11.697 --> 01:20:13.629
that they act
out of disrespect for women

01:20:13.631 --> 01:20:16.169
and they don't want them
to be priests, no matter what.

01:20:16.734 --> 01:20:19.639
But the testimony shows,
without a shadow of a doubt,

01:20:20.773 --> 01:20:24.240
that the defendants
justifiably believe

01:20:24.242 --> 01:20:25.808
that what they are doing

01:20:25.810 --> 01:20:30.282
is a direction from the example
of Jesus Christ.

01:20:30.683 --> 01:20:33.217
And so the answer
to the first jury question

01:20:33.219 --> 01:20:34.354
must be...

01:20:35.287 --> 01:20:36.189
no.

01:20:41.327 --> 01:20:44.330
What was the will of Jesus?

01:20:45.697 --> 01:20:48.433
Catholic leaders
have prayed about it.

01:20:50.236 --> 01:20:51.604
They've researched it.

01:20:52.237 --> 01:20:55.674
Looked at it
in every way possible.

01:20:56.675 --> 01:20:58.842
And they consistently answer it

01:20:58.844 --> 01:21:01.681
as Christ would have
had them answer it.

01:21:02.982 --> 01:21:05.685
They do
what is required of them.

01:21:06.785 --> 01:21:07.921
By their faith.

01:21:09.354 --> 01:21:10.689
By their belief.

01:21:11.290 --> 01:21:12.859
And they cannot do otherwise.

01:21:14.326 --> 01:21:17.796
The priesthood
is reserved for the male gender.

01:21:18.764 --> 01:21:19.732
Forever.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.600
Therefore,
the only answer possible

01:21:23.602 --> 01:21:25.438
to the second jury question,

01:21:26.005 --> 01:21:26.969
is yes.

01:21:28.373 --> 01:21:29.375
Thank you.

01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:44.620
Hey, thanks for coming, man.
I know Dunbar would flip

01:21:44.622 --> 01:21:46.556
if he knew you were anywhere
near this case.

01:21:46.558 --> 01:21:48.661
Five hours is such a long time
for such a short trial.

01:21:48.961 --> 01:21:50.494
Five hours
and 36 minutes,

01:21:50.496 --> 01:21:51.764
but who's counting?

01:21:52.563 --> 01:21:53.929
Relax, Tommy.

01:21:53.931 --> 01:21:55.867
It's like Ally says,
it's God's will.

01:21:56.468 --> 01:21:57.836
No matter what the results are.

01:22:06.545 --> 01:22:08.348
Yeah. Thanks.

01:22:09.614 --> 01:22:10.683
They're back.

01:22:11.582 --> 01:22:12.551
Good luck, Tommy.

01:22:14.952 --> 01:22:16.520
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

01:22:16.522 --> 01:22:18.625
have you reached
a unanimous verdict?

01:22:20.326 --> 01:22:21.461
We have, Your Honor.

01:22:21.794 --> 01:22:23.793
Concerning
question number one,

01:22:23.795 --> 01:22:26.029
do you find that the defendants
discriminate against women

01:22:26.031 --> 01:22:28.765
solely because of their gender
by excluding them

01:22:28.767 --> 01:22:30.467
from the seminary
in order to study

01:22:30.469 --> 01:22:31.938
for the Catholic priesthood?

01:22:32.403 --> 01:22:33.473
Yes or no.

01:22:33.671 --> 01:22:35.771
Yes, Your Honor.

01:22:35.773 --> 01:22:37.943
They discriminate against women
solely because of their gender.

01:22:38.477 --> 01:22:40.377
Concerning
question number two,

01:22:40.379 --> 01:22:43.416
do you find that the defendants
have a justifiable basis

01:22:43.715 --> 01:22:45.449
to exclude women
from the seminary

01:22:45.451 --> 01:22:47.817
in order to study
for the Catholic priesthood

01:22:47.819 --> 01:22:49.386
solely because of their gender?

01:22:49.388 --> 01:22:50.419
Yes or no.

01:22:50.421 --> 01:22:51.788
No, Your Honor.

01:22:51.790 --> 01:22:53.089
They do not have
a justifiable basis

01:22:53.091 --> 01:22:54.460
for discrimination.

01:22:56.362 --> 01:22:58.962
As the jury
has found for the plaintiff

01:22:58.964 --> 01:23:00.700
on those two issues of fact,

01:23:00.998 --> 01:23:04.401
it is left to me to grant
or deny a mandatory injunction

01:23:04.403 --> 01:23:08.574
that requires the seminary
to accept Ms. Batista.

01:23:10.142 --> 01:23:11.344
However...

01:23:26.125 --> 01:23:27.827
Am I gonna be a Catholic priest?

01:23:29.461 --> 01:23:30.663
We won on both counts.

01:23:31.496 --> 01:23:32.862
The church
discriminated against you,

01:23:32.864 --> 01:23:34.664
because you are a women

01:23:34.666 --> 01:23:36.703
and they had no
justifiable basis in doing so.

01:23:38.937 --> 01:23:39.971
Thank God.

01:23:40.906 --> 01:23:42.709
So, can I start the seminary
in the fall?

01:23:43.608 --> 01:23:44.743
No, Ally.

01:23:45.443 --> 01:23:46.611
I'm afraid you can't.

01:23:47.746 --> 01:23:48.681
Why not?

01:23:49.614 --> 01:23:50.782
After the verdicts,

01:23:51.550 --> 01:23:53.482
Judge Watford has to decide

01:23:53.484 --> 01:23:55.752
whether to grant what's called
a mandatory injunction,

01:23:55.754 --> 01:23:58.123
forcing the church to allow you
to enter the seminary.

01:24:00.925 --> 01:24:01.960
I remember.

01:24:03.228 --> 01:24:06.632
An injunction's only available
if you have no other options.

01:24:07.933 --> 01:24:10.737
If you want to become a priest
in a Christian religion,

01:24:11.670 --> 01:24:13.069
several will accept you.

01:24:13.071 --> 01:24:14.771
This is Renzulli's question

01:24:14.773 --> 01:24:16.106
about why I didn't apply
to another seminary.

01:24:16.108 --> 01:24:17.043
Exactly.

01:24:17.809 --> 01:24:18.977
You have options.

01:24:19.812 --> 01:24:21.210
So, the judge can't force

01:24:21.212 --> 01:24:23.014
the Catholic Church
to accept you.

01:24:24.049 --> 01:24:25.385
I'm sorry.

01:24:27.920 --> 01:24:29.055
But we were right.

01:24:31.657 --> 01:24:32.658
Yeah, Ally.

01:24:34.593 --> 01:24:35.627
We were right.

01:24:38.996 --> 01:24:41.401
Do you think I can work
with students again?

01:24:43.100 --> 01:24:44.437
I'll see what I can do.

01:25:05.491 --> 01:25:06.755
- I missed you.
- I missed you.

01:25:06.757 --> 01:25:07.923
Look what I'm wearing.

01:25:07.925 --> 01:25:09.558
- I'm so happy.
- Yes!

01:25:09.560 --> 01:25:10.960
I'm gonna come play with you.
Okay?

01:25:18.036 --> 01:25:19.038
Aaw!

01:25:24.910 --> 01:25:25.877
I'm back.

01:25:27.045 --> 01:25:28.114
Thanks to Renzulli.

01:25:33.018 --> 01:25:34.487
Has anything changed?

01:25:35.554 --> 01:25:36.522
No.

01:25:37.723 --> 01:25:39.792
But this allows us
to fight another day.

01:26:00.845 --> 01:26:03.248
Let's go.
Let's go. Let's go.

01:26:08.586 --> 01:26:09.754
Everyone's okay?

01:27:27.334 --> 01:27:32.334
