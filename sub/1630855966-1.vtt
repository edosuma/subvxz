WEBVTT

00:16.851 --> 00:18.895
Are we good?

00:19.270 --> 00:20.438
Whenever you're ready,
say "Action."

00:20.438 --> 00:21.898
interviewer 1:
I'm ready. Action.

00:21.898 --> 00:23.191
Give me another movie
right now.

00:23.191 --> 00:25.026
I'll give you first shot.

00:25.026 --> 00:26.360
interviewer 1:
Uh, "North By Northwest."

00:26.360 --> 00:29.530
"North By Northwest."
Here we go. Building lobby.

00:30.323 --> 00:31.574
<i>People coming out.</i>

00:31.574 --> 00:33.284
<i>Soon after,
three people coming out.</i>

00:33.284 --> 00:35.203
<i>You see Cary Grant
with his secretary</i>

00:35.203 --> 00:36.996
<i>walking towards
our first shot.</i>

00:36.996 --> 00:38.289
Like this.

00:39.040 --> 00:39.999
Come out outside.

00:39.999 --> 00:41.501
<i>He gets a cab before the guy.</i>

00:41.501 --> 00:43.586
<i>Woman wanna get a cab
to show his character</i>

00:43.586 --> 00:45.421
<i>he don't give a shit
about the woman.</i>

00:45.421 --> 00:48.216
Now, how many human being
on this planet,

00:48.216 --> 00:51.052
"You give me a movie,
I give you first shot?"

00:51.052 --> 00:54.972
None. Not one. Only me.

00:54.972 --> 00:56.599
interviewer 1:
"Giant."

00:56.599 --> 00:58.142
"Giant."

00:58.142 --> 01:00.228
<i>He's on the train going
to see Elizabeth Taylor.</i>

01:02.563 --> 01:05.900
Gimme another one. Let's go.
Speed, I give it to you.

01:05.900 --> 01:07.485
interviewer 1:
Uh, "Lawrence Of Arabia."

01:07.485 --> 01:09.862
"Lawrence Of Arabia."
Now, watch this one.

01:09.862 --> 01:11.572
This one, oh, my God.

01:12.240 --> 01:15.701
My forte.
Bird's-eye shot, like this.

01:15.701 --> 01:17.370
Concrete.

01:17.370 --> 01:20.456
The tiles are about 3'4."

01:20.623 --> 01:22.917
<i>You see Larry,
which is Lawrence of Arabia,</i>

01:22.917 --> 01:27.088
<i>Peter O'Toole, walking slowly
towards the motorcycle</i>

01:27.088 --> 01:29.257
<i>on the left.
He fix something,</i>

01:29.257 --> 01:32.093
he walks back,
and he comes back again,

01:32.093 --> 01:33.678
and he jump
on the motorcycle.

01:33.678 --> 01:35.012
As he pushes the--

01:38.391 --> 01:40.435
Cut to him. He's got the wind,
got the glasses.

01:44.230 --> 01:45.440
Suddenly, a truck comes.

01:51.738 --> 01:53.614
interviewer 2:
"Breakfast At Tiffany's"?

01:53.614 --> 01:56.075
It's a comedy,
but I'll give it to you anyway.

01:56.075 --> 01:59.370
It's kind of a comedy,
and very racist
with Mickey Rooney.

01:59.370 --> 02:01.539
Playing (gibberish),
supposed to be Japanese.

02:01.539 --> 02:05.126
<i>Disgusting, uh, racism
character, right?</i>

02:05.126 --> 02:06.502
<i>Hollywood production.</i>

02:11.966 --> 02:15.303
<i>The long shot,
"Breakfast At Tiffany's,"
sun rising.</i>

02:15.303 --> 02:19.348
<i>Tiffany on the right.
New York cabs and everything.</i>

02:19.348 --> 02:20.975
<i>Oh, you get off
in the evening clothes,</i>

02:20.975 --> 02:22.602
<i>looking in
the window of Tiffany.</i>

02:22.602 --> 02:23.770
Thank you. Next.

02:23.770 --> 02:25.813
interviewer 1:
Why is the first shot
so important?

02:26.731 --> 02:27.982
Why not?

02:27.982 --> 02:29.609
First shot,
of course, is important.

02:29.609 --> 02:31.152
Is your birth important?

02:31.152 --> 02:33.654
When we first time meet,
is it important?

02:33.654 --> 02:36.157
Look at the entrance
of Beijing Opera.

02:37.867 --> 02:39.786
My father coming out.

02:41.871 --> 02:44.582
First of all,

02:45.458 --> 02:49.170
the minute he enter,
the lights go tang! Like this.

02:49.170 --> 02:51.506
You watch his body language.

02:51.506 --> 02:54.258
Split second, you know
who he is!

02:54.258 --> 02:55.301
That's an entrance.

03:32.964 --> 03:35.842
Give me, uh, black and white

03:35.842 --> 03:39.554
with a stick, please.
And rubber hammer.

03:42.598 --> 03:43.891
Thank you.

03:45.768 --> 03:47.812
So, I'm trying
to marry this part

03:47.812 --> 03:51.149
with this part a little bit.
I'll see what happens, okay?

03:51.149 --> 03:53.484
If I put white first...

03:59.741 --> 04:03.035
and a little bit of black
on top, black would dominate.

04:03.035 --> 04:05.246
Where's the hammer?
Hammer, darling.

04:05.246 --> 04:07.331
Speed, please. Speed.

04:07.331 --> 04:09.542
See? Didn't come.

04:09.542 --> 04:11.711
Came late, and this fell.

04:11.711 --> 04:14.088
So, what do I do with this?
Don't worry about it.

04:14.088 --> 04:15.923
It's part of the process.

04:16.257 --> 04:18.259
It meant to be.

04:18.259 --> 04:20.553
- Hoo!

04:27.602 --> 04:28.770
Let's...

04:28.770 --> 04:30.438
thousand flower bloom.

04:30.438 --> 04:32.815
- Hoo!

04:37.820 --> 04:41.240
So, this is quite a nice hit.
We got to control that corner.

04:41.240 --> 04:43.117
- Hoo!

04:43.117 --> 04:46.287
In terms of my father's
Beijing Opera,

04:46.287 --> 04:48.956
the beard, he--
the idea is to make it heavy.

04:50.458 --> 04:52.043
Everything heavy, expensive,

04:52.043 --> 04:54.379
and, uh, difficult
is usually good.

04:54.379 --> 04:57.215
Tai chi is very light, right?

04:57.215 --> 04:59.592
But it's heavy. Hoo!

05:00.093 --> 05:01.552
<i>Beard.</i>

05:01.552 --> 05:05.431
<i>Longer, thick, heavy.</i>

05:05.765 --> 05:07.433
<i>It's beautiful.</i>

05:07.934 --> 05:10.353
<i>He can blow a candle out.</i>

05:12.814 --> 05:15.108
The air go through
the thickness of the beard

05:15.108 --> 05:16.234
<i>to put out the candle.</i>

05:17.819 --> 05:20.696
An orchestra is heavy.
Tang! Tang!

05:20.696 --> 05:23.950
- Tay! The "tay"
is Picasso's focus.

05:25.660 --> 05:28.287
<i>When I was a little boy,
like 4 years old,</i>

05:28.287 --> 05:30.415
<i>someone took me to
the backstage,</i>

05:30.415 --> 05:32.291
<i>and I saw
Chinese Beijing Opera,</i>

05:32.291 --> 05:34.419
<i>big face
painted different color.</i>

05:34.419 --> 05:36.212
The most frightening thing
you ever seen.

05:36.212 --> 05:37.547
I was shocked.

05:37.547 --> 05:39.465
<i>- And I was so frightened.</i>

05:39.465 --> 05:41.718
<i>But at the same time
attracted to it.</i>

05:41.718 --> 05:44.345
<i>So, the spirit of
Beijing Opera,</i>

05:44.345 --> 05:46.305
<i>the energy,</i>

05:46.305 --> 05:47.849
<i>that is in my blood already.</i>

05:53.354 --> 05:55.898
<i>Okay, the movie
starts like this.</i>

05:58.443 --> 06:00.695
<i>In my childhood,</i>

06:00.695 --> 06:03.072
<i>atmosphere of Shanghai,
very exciting.</i>

06:03.072 --> 06:07.285
<i>Very, um, full of foreigners
at the same time.</i>

06:07.285 --> 06:10.496
<i>And gangsters and opium</i>

06:10.496 --> 06:13.875
<i>and decadence
and Beijing Opera</i>

06:13.875 --> 06:15.960
<i>and food and lights.</i>

06:16.210 --> 06:17.295
Incredible city.

06:23.718 --> 06:25.595
<i>So, let's set up
this first scene</i>

06:25.595 --> 06:27.430
<i>in this man's life.</i>

06:27.430 --> 06:31.100
<i>When I was born,
I was given two names.</i>

06:32.518 --> 06:36.064
<i>My Chinese name
is Zhou Yinghua.</i>

06:36.064 --> 06:37.690
<i>Ying means hero.</i>

06:37.690 --> 06:40.777
<i>Hua is China,
so I'm China's hero.</i>

06:40.777 --> 06:43.488
<i>Two, my mother,
who's Catholic,</i>

06:43.488 --> 06:46.574
<i>already named me
Michael Chow.</i>

06:47.075 --> 06:50.536
Cecilia Zhou:
<i>Michael's childhood is
totally different from ours.</i>

06:51.079 --> 06:55.083
<i>The time when he started
to have his asthma,</i>

06:55.083 --> 06:57.877
<i>his fate is sealed.</i>

06:57.877 --> 07:02.048
That means he became
my mother's focus.

07:02.924 --> 07:05.259
<i>He was the only child
that had his cradle</i>

07:05.259 --> 07:07.595
<i>next to my mother's bed.</i>

07:09.430 --> 07:11.349
Michael Chow:
<i>My mother attended me</i>

07:11.349 --> 07:13.601
<i>with tremendous amount
of fuss</i>

07:13.601 --> 07:17.438
<i>and spoiled me
and overprotecting me.</i>

07:17.438 --> 07:19.690
<i>I hardly go to school.</i>

07:19.690 --> 07:22.318
<i>I literally lived
like a prince.</i>

07:24.862 --> 07:28.116
<i>I'm influenced very much
by both of them.</i>

07:28.658 --> 07:31.953
<i>My mother, quarter Scottish,</i>

07:33.371 --> 07:34.747
<i>fluent in English,</i>

07:34.747 --> 07:38.042
<i>and a very modern woman.</i>

07:38.292 --> 07:41.087
<i>My mother was very smart,</i>

07:41.087 --> 07:42.296
<i>very capable,</i>

07:42.296 --> 07:45.925
<i>dealt with all the underworld
societies in Shanghai.</i>

07:46.217 --> 07:48.136
<i>Because the whole
theater world</i>

07:48.136 --> 07:49.262
<i>is gangster world.</i>

07:49.262 --> 07:51.472
<i>So, my mother,
she carries a gun.</i>

07:51.472 --> 07:53.433
<i>She fought all the gangsters.</i>

07:55.977 --> 07:59.772
<i>And, uh,
my father is opposite.</i>

08:00.732 --> 08:02.817
<i>He was completely an artist.</i>

08:05.403 --> 08:08.656
<i>He was devoted to theater,</i>

08:08.656 --> 08:11.159
<i>read everything,
wrote many plays.</i>

08:11.159 --> 08:15.246
<i>Smell theater, eat theater,
sleeps theater.</i>

08:15.997 --> 08:18.916
<i>He was famous
when he was 7 years old.</i>

08:19.834 --> 08:23.004
His stage name
become Qi-lin Tong.

08:24.547 --> 08:28.426
<i>It means "unicorn boy."</i>

08:29.135 --> 08:32.930
<i>Unfortunately,
at late teenage age,</i>

08:32.930 --> 08:34.599
<i>his voice broke.</i>

08:34.599 --> 08:36.059
<i>It become very rough.</i>

08:37.518 --> 08:41.564
A master hides his weakness.

08:41.981 --> 08:45.693
A grandmaster uses his weakness.

08:50.823 --> 08:54.202
<i>My father revolutionized
the Beijing Opera</i>

08:54.202 --> 08:58.372
<i>by creating a new style
of acting called</i> qi pai.

09:02.877 --> 09:06.297
<i>He performed
almost every night.</i>

09:06.297 --> 09:08.674
<i>He was a giant of an actor,</i>

09:08.674 --> 09:11.260
<i>so I wanted to be
just like him.</i>

09:35.243 --> 09:37.078
<i>In the early 1950s,</i>

09:37.078 --> 09:40.581
<i>there was lot
of uncertainty in China.</i>

09:40.957 --> 09:43.167
<i>My mother saw an opportunity</i>

09:43.167 --> 09:47.338
<i>to send some of her children
to study in the West,</i>

09:47.338 --> 09:49.340
<i>except for my brother, William,</i>

09:49.340 --> 09:53.261
<i>who followed my father's
footsteps in Beijing Opera.</i>

09:54.095 --> 09:56.889
<i>And my sister, Tsai Chin,
was going to London</i>

09:56.889 --> 09:59.559
<i>to study acting,
which, at the time,</i>

09:59.559 --> 10:02.895
<i>was very unusual
for a Chinese girl.</i>

10:02.895 --> 10:06.441
<i>And I was going to England
for boarding school.</i>

10:09.986 --> 10:12.447
<i>While my mother
was in Hong Kong,</i>

10:12.447 --> 10:15.116
<i>preparing for my voyage
to London,</i>

10:15.116 --> 10:18.327
<i>I was left alone
in Shanghai with my father.</i>

10:22.957 --> 10:25.626
<i>I would go to his rehearsals</i>

10:25.626 --> 10:27.545
<i>and watched him perform.</i>

10:35.261 --> 10:37.764
<i>My father was always busy.</i>

10:37.889 --> 10:40.808
<i>That was the only time
I had the warmth</i>

10:40.808 --> 10:43.478
<i>of the father-and-son
relationship.</i>

10:48.066 --> 10:51.944
<i>I spent 10 magical days
with him.</i>

10:57.658 --> 10:59.619
<i>I always remembered</i>

10:59.619 --> 11:02.163
<i>what he said to me
before we parted.</i>

11:03.498 --> 11:06.000
<i>He said, "Wherever you go,</i>

11:06.000 --> 11:09.170
<i>always remember
you are Chinese."</i>

11:15.760 --> 11:18.513
So, that's my bonding
with my father,

11:18.513 --> 11:21.724
and it's enough.
And, uh...

11:23.893 --> 11:26.396
Yeah. It lasted me a lifetime.

11:34.904 --> 11:38.241
<i>And then, I took a slow boat
to Southampton London.</i>

11:40.201 --> 11:42.870
<i>I was with my sister,
Tsai Chin.</i>

11:46.457 --> 11:48.793
<i>The journey took 30 days.</i>

11:56.884 --> 11:59.178
<i>We went through India,</i>

12:00.888 --> 12:04.142
<i>Suez Canal, and Egypt.</i>

12:16.529 --> 12:18.823
<i>When I arrived in England,</i>

12:18.823 --> 12:21.617
<i>I parted with my sister.</i>

12:22.994 --> 12:25.204
<i>And then the train
take me to London.</i>

12:28.416 --> 12:30.752
<i>I end up in London</i>

12:30.752 --> 12:33.171
<i>on the most foggiest day
England ever had.</i>

12:36.591 --> 12:39.677
<i>And then to some
strange funny house.</i>

12:39.677 --> 12:43.556
And they gave me Welsh rarebit
for dinner,

12:43.556 --> 12:46.601
which is toast with cheese.

12:46.601 --> 12:48.936
And then, the door closed.

12:48.936 --> 12:51.522
In the movie,
the soundtrack will be...

12:52.940 --> 12:55.109
and screen goes black.

13:01.783 --> 13:03.326
<i>I'm on my own.</i>

13:03.326 --> 13:06.204
<i>No language, no nothing.</i>

13:06.204 --> 13:09.123
<i>Completely separated
from my family.</i>

13:12.585 --> 13:14.504
<i>I'm in a deep hole,</i>

13:14.504 --> 13:16.547
<i>like I'm landing on the moon.</i>

13:18.800 --> 13:21.803
<i>The deep fear of abandonment.</i>

13:21.803 --> 13:24.138
<i>Constant panic attack.</i>

13:25.390 --> 13:28.768
<i>Then I realized,
"What are you going to do?"</i>

13:28.768 --> 13:30.812
<i>I'm supposed to be a prince.</i>

13:30.812 --> 13:34.148
<i>I'm supposed to be
this big star's son.</i>

13:35.108 --> 13:38.277
<i>I cannot let him down.</i>

13:38.277 --> 13:42.448
<i>From a very young age,
I knew I must be great.</i>

13:45.743 --> 13:48.955
Then, I crawl
out of the dungeon,

13:48.955 --> 13:52.291
like this, into daylight.

13:53.918 --> 13:55.920
<i>Then, I went
to boarding school.</i>

13:56.504 --> 13:59.340
<i>Kind of like
a Harry Potter situation.</i>

14:02.051 --> 14:04.929
<i>I was very unhappy there.
I can't mix with anybody.</i>

14:04.929 --> 14:07.849
And they make me run.
I got asthma. How can I run?

14:07.849 --> 14:10.685
<i>They made me run anyway.</i>

14:13.938 --> 14:17.400
<i>One day, a fellow student,
they say to me,</i>

14:17.400 --> 14:20.319
"Ooh! We gonna eat rice!"

14:20.987 --> 14:23.781
So, I said, "Great." Then,
I end up with rice pudding,

14:23.781 --> 14:25.658
which is sweet, and I went,

14:25.658 --> 14:28.202
"What the fuck is that?"

14:28.202 --> 14:31.330
<i>Rice, you see?
Very simple thing.</i>

14:32.999 --> 14:35.251
I was deprived from it.

14:37.920 --> 14:42.008
And, of course,
it's not really the rice.
It's the whole thing.

14:46.095 --> 14:48.556
<i>And don't forget, I come
from the contrast.</i>

14:48.556 --> 14:51.434
<i>Uh, pampered by everybody.</i>

14:51.434 --> 14:54.062
<i>Spoiled, fragile.</i>

14:54.062 --> 14:57.148
Now, I gotta be
this tough prison.

14:57.148 --> 14:59.150
I mean, this basically
is prison to me.

14:59.150 --> 15:02.070
<i>I get bullied
and all that shit.</i>

15:04.238 --> 15:08.201
<i>So, my subconscious say,
"Rebuild my identity."</i>

15:08.201 --> 15:11.120
I got to rebuild a new China.

15:11.746 --> 15:14.040
New culture.

15:14.916 --> 15:17.877
Especially in a foreign land.

15:17.877 --> 15:21.047
Hey, look!
Cheeky, cheeky laundry!

15:21.047 --> 15:23.091
Please don't do that!

15:23.091 --> 15:25.593
- Catch, Slick!
Chink in the middle!
- Don't! Please!

15:25.593 --> 15:27.053
Please! Please!

15:27.053 --> 15:30.098
<i>When I was 18, 19,
my sister, Tsai,</i>

15:30.098 --> 15:32.058
<i>was already
a working actress.</i>

15:32.392 --> 15:34.685
- Please don't! Please!
- It's not fair!
Stop it, boys! Please!

15:34.685 --> 15:36.771
<i>She got me a role
in the movie she was in.</i>

15:37.939 --> 15:39.190
Please, Johnny.
I'll lose my job.

15:39.190 --> 15:40.233
Then, I'll lose the van.

15:40.233 --> 15:41.943
- Then you can't use it.
- Shut up!

15:42.276 --> 15:44.737
And like all the movie (laughs),

15:44.737 --> 15:48.324
<i>I play
a Chinese laundry boy.</i>

15:48.324 --> 15:51.619
- You're working late.
- 24-hour service, Mister.

15:51.619 --> 15:54.705
And, uh, my first scene
was my death scene.

16:03.089 --> 16:06.134
<i>It's the first shot of
my experience as an actor.</i>

16:06.134 --> 16:08.720
It's the Chinese kid.
He's dead.

16:10.012 --> 16:12.181
<i>The minute I have that part,</i>

16:12.181 --> 16:15.476
<i>all the other
movie parts comes.</i>

16:15.476 --> 16:18.354
<i>In Chinese,
there's a very famous saying.</i>

16:18.354 --> 16:20.440
"If you want to do
anything properly,

16:20.440 --> 16:22.233
you have to eat bitter."

16:22.233 --> 16:24.736
<i>Chi ku. Chi</i> means eat.

16:24.736 --> 16:26.571
<i>Ku</i> means bitter.

16:26.904 --> 16:30.867
<i>- So, I adopted a Zen attitude,</i>

16:30.867 --> 16:33.494
<i>which is minimalism in living.</i>

16:33.494 --> 16:36.873
<i>- And I was living in a studio
with one stove...</i>

16:36.873 --> 16:39.625
<i>...one pot, one frying pan,</i>

16:39.625 --> 16:42.336
<i>one spoon, and one bed.</i>

16:44.047 --> 16:46.132
<i>And I feel lucky.</i>

16:46.132 --> 16:49.927
<i>At that time, England had
an educational policy</i>

16:49.927 --> 16:52.013
<i>to have art schools,</i>

16:52.013 --> 16:53.931
<i>so I went to Saint Martin's,</i>

16:53.931 --> 16:55.683
<i>and I started painting.</i>

16:58.186 --> 17:00.772
<i>To support myself,</i>

17:00.772 --> 17:03.357
<i>I got some help
from my mother,</i>

17:03.357 --> 17:05.860
<i>and also, I acted in movies.</i>

17:08.988 --> 17:11.699
<i>So I was making this movie.</i>

17:12.867 --> 17:15.870
<i>I have to shave my hair.</i>

17:15.870 --> 17:17.705
<i>I had no choice.
You kidding me?</i>

17:17.705 --> 17:19.165
<i>I won't be working if I--</i>

17:19.165 --> 17:20.458
You know, I won't do this

17:20.458 --> 17:22.377
because this is degrading
to the Chinese people.

17:22.377 --> 17:25.046
Thanks, Major!
Anytime you need me.

17:25.046 --> 17:27.215
<i>But, at least I can
make a living</i>

17:27.215 --> 17:29.842
<i>with biggest movie star
in the world.</i>

17:29.842 --> 17:33.679
<i>Charlton Heston,
Ava Gardner,
you name it, right?</i>

17:34.514 --> 17:37.058
<i>Anyway, I'm good at
being charming, you know?</i>

17:37.392 --> 17:39.102
My mother's side coming out.

17:39.102 --> 17:42.897
<i>- And also, I guess
I'm little bit talented.</i>

17:54.909 --> 17:57.203
<i>In 1961, Michael,</i>

17:57.203 --> 18:00.748
at that time,
was filming in Rome.

18:09.257 --> 18:12.051
<i>The first time I went to Rome.</i>

18:12.051 --> 18:14.846
And I went,
"Wow, what a city."

18:16.222 --> 18:20.351
<i>It was Rome post-Fellini's
"La Dolce Vita."</i>

18:21.102 --> 18:23.730
<i>- So Rome at the coolest.</i>

18:24.939 --> 18:27.734
<i>I was on location
for six months,</i>

18:28.401 --> 18:30.653
<i>eating in the best restaurant, everything.</i>

18:31.863 --> 18:34.282
<i>This is like a movie, right?</i>

18:34.282 --> 18:36.701
<i>In fact, all my life,
growing up,</i>

18:36.701 --> 18:38.494
<i>I live in the movies.</i>

18:42.832 --> 18:46.210
<i>My mother, she loves movies.
I love movies.</i>

18:47.420 --> 18:49.672
<i>We would go to see movies
every afternoon.</i>

18:49.672 --> 18:51.424
<i>A double feature.</i>

18:53.968 --> 18:56.387
<i>Nonstop, five hours.</i>

18:56.387 --> 18:59.307
<i>Escape to a magical place.</i>

19:00.975 --> 19:04.437
<i>Her favorite genre is
film noir, and so is mine.</i>

19:08.316 --> 19:10.359
<i>My mother came to Rome.</i>

19:10.359 --> 19:13.988
<i>I haven't seen her
for, uh, eight years,</i>

19:13.988 --> 19:17.325
but, to me, like eternity,
you know?

19:17.325 --> 19:19.368
<i>When Michael first saw Mother,</i>

19:19.368 --> 19:22.747
<i>he fell upon her lap
and cried.</i>

19:22.747 --> 19:24.874
"Why are you so cruel,

19:24.874 --> 19:26.709
"sending me away

19:26.709 --> 19:29.837
at such a young age?"

19:29.837 --> 19:33.341
<i>And my mother,
what, what else can she say?</i>

19:35.510 --> 19:38.137
<i>20th century in China,</i>

19:38.137 --> 19:41.265
<i>we suffered from
two world wars, civil war,</i>

19:41.265 --> 19:44.102
famine, you name it.

19:44.102 --> 19:48.106
But above all,
foreign humiliation.

19:48.106 --> 19:50.108
<i>Because you are dealing with</i>

19:50.108 --> 19:53.569
<i>the soul
of Chinese suffering.</i>

19:53.569 --> 19:56.531
<i>She sent me to London
out of love.</i>

19:59.617 --> 20:03.538
No one can ask
for better than love.

20:07.375 --> 20:08.626
<i>My life extreme.</i>

20:08.626 --> 20:12.046
<i>My life is designed
for melodrama drama.</i>

20:12.797 --> 20:14.215
<i>In destiny.</i>

20:15.425 --> 20:18.428
<i>So my whole world
become movie.</i>

20:21.556 --> 20:24.183
Maximillian Chow:
<i>Movies and my dad.</i>

20:24.183 --> 20:26.185
<i>Movies are dreams.</i>

20:28.730 --> 20:32.567
<i>And that
he lives his life dreaming</i>

20:32.567 --> 20:35.153
for whatever story
he wants to tell

20:35.153 --> 20:36.863
and be told and to live in.

20:39.240 --> 20:42.368
<i>"Modesty Blaise"
with Monica Vitti.</i>

20:42.368 --> 20:44.746
Read it to me, please.

20:44.746 --> 20:47.373
<i>The opening shot,
they dubbed me, unfortunately.</i>

20:47.373 --> 20:49.917
Scorpio,
not like you to be lazy.

20:49.917 --> 20:53.254
- No.
- But today, it is
an effort to exert yourself.

20:53.254 --> 20:55.423
<i>I don't speak
proper English, right?</i>

20:55.423 --> 20:57.884
<i>I wasn't properly educated,</i>

20:57.884 --> 20:59.594
but I fake it through
really good, right?

20:59.594 --> 21:02.430
Sounds good, sounds like
I speak excellent English,

21:02.430 --> 21:03.890
but, in fact, I don't.

21:03.890 --> 21:06.350
You know, he came to the West,

21:06.350 --> 21:10.354
didn't have the language,
didn't have, um, family.

21:10.354 --> 21:12.607
And so,
what could you connect to

21:12.607 --> 21:15.943
other than these visual mediums
that would, um,

21:19.238 --> 21:20.615
make you feel safe?

21:30.792 --> 21:34.504
- Let's do one across first.

21:34.504 --> 21:37.548
- Okay, here we go.

21:37.548 --> 21:40.385
So this is a process, right?
It's like cooking.

21:41.594 --> 21:42.637
And you make everything perfect,

21:42.637 --> 21:44.806
the painting not gonna
come out right.

21:45.306 --> 21:47.517
- So, you need lot of...

21:48.601 --> 21:50.395
...lot of <i>kung fu.</i>

21:50.395 --> 21:51.813
Okay, let's go across...

21:51.813 --> 21:54.232
<i>Fundamental difference
between the West and the East</i>

21:54.232 --> 21:55.942
<i>in terms of thinking...</i>

21:55.942 --> 21:57.235
Go to the edge.

21:57.235 --> 21:59.320
...is man, again, with nature,

21:59.320 --> 22:00.988
gotta be in harmony with nature.

22:00.988 --> 22:04.659
That's why Chinese painting,
you see man, tiny little thing,

22:04.659 --> 22:08.246
which, which is the truth,
become harmony.

22:08.246 --> 22:09.664
The West wanna conquer it.

22:11.958 --> 22:13.835
One thing about collaging

22:13.835 --> 22:16.379
is, endlessly,
you can save the painting.

22:20.216 --> 22:22.593
I improvised just now.

22:22.593 --> 22:25.012
- I rather like this.

22:27.432 --> 22:30.184
- Sometimes, I wanna
have this burn.

22:30.184 --> 22:32.770
Burn represent pain, right?

22:32.770 --> 22:36.065
Pain, suffering,
is a fuel for the artist.

22:40.111 --> 22:42.196
Sometime make beautiful holes.

22:43.614 --> 22:45.533
I'm painting with the fire.

22:45.533 --> 22:47.410
See how beautiful it become?

22:50.955 --> 22:52.081
<i>When I was young,</i>

22:52.081 --> 22:54.876
<i>I wanted to become a painter.</i>

22:57.628 --> 23:01.424
<i>And I painted religiously for
about 14 years. Religiously.</i>

23:01.424 --> 23:03.593
- Hammer, please.

23:05.136 --> 23:08.014
<i>But, eventually, I give up.</i>

23:08.014 --> 23:11.809
<i>China in the West
was low of low in everything.</i>

23:12.435 --> 23:14.520
<i>They say,
"No, you can't be a painter.</i>

23:15.021 --> 23:18.274
<i>"In fact, you can't
do anything, except for</i>

23:18.649 --> 23:21.527
restaurant and laundry."

23:21.527 --> 23:24.655
So, I said, "Okay.
Let me be creative."

23:40.213 --> 23:45.093
<i>I soon discovered three things
if you can pass in England.</i>

23:45.093 --> 23:46.886
<i>Eccentric,</i>

23:46.886 --> 23:48.805
<i>aristocrat,</i>

23:48.805 --> 23:50.598
<i>artistic.</i>

23:50.598 --> 23:52.767
Well, I think I'm an aristocrat

23:52.767 --> 23:54.727
because I was born
into a prince.

23:54.727 --> 23:56.729
How do I know this?
Look at my hand.

23:56.729 --> 23:59.649
Does it look like a laborer?
No.

24:00.608 --> 24:02.819
Look, delicate little thing.

24:02.819 --> 24:04.862
I also went to a fortune teller

24:04.862 --> 24:07.615
in, um, in Hong Kong
with my sister.

24:07.615 --> 24:09.450
And first thing he says to me,

24:09.450 --> 24:11.619
<i>I have to be eccentric.</i>

24:11.619 --> 24:13.454
<i>The more eccentric I am,</i>

24:13.454 --> 24:15.415
<i>the more successful
I will become.</i>

24:15.957 --> 24:18.626
- Do you like coffee?
- Yes. Is this a Gallup poll?

24:18.626 --> 24:20.086
No.

24:20.086 --> 24:22.547
Only thing I asked was
would you like cup of coffee?

24:22.547 --> 24:24.298
Yes, please.

24:24.298 --> 24:25.800
Well, the kitchen's over there.

24:25.800 --> 24:27.301
You know how to make it,
don't you?

24:28.344 --> 24:30.763
Grace Coddington:
<i>Well, I think it coincided
with a time</i>

24:30.763 --> 24:34.350
<i>that he was also, um, filming</i>

24:34.350 --> 24:36.436
<i>a film called "Joanna."</i>

24:36.686 --> 24:40.523
And he permed his hair
for this part.

24:40.523 --> 24:43.526
My darling Grace.

24:43.526 --> 24:45.403
<i>Grace, I knew
a little bit already.</i>

24:45.403 --> 24:47.780
<i>She was already
a very famous model</i>

24:47.780 --> 24:51.325
<i>when she did the iconic
Vidal Sassoon cut.</i>

24:51.325 --> 24:52.827
<i>When I was pretty young</i>

24:52.827 --> 24:54.829
<i>and a young model and stuff,</i>

24:54.829 --> 24:59.167
<i>I was sharing a flat
with a lot of</i>

24:59.167 --> 25:02.712
young Asian actress.

25:02.712 --> 25:06.632
Uh, one of them was
actually Tsai Chin, his sister.

25:08.134 --> 25:11.679
Why do Chinese girls taste
different from all other girls?

25:11.679 --> 25:14.348
You think we're better, huh?

25:14.348 --> 25:15.892
No, just different.

25:15.892 --> 25:19.604
Like Peking duck is different
from Russian caviar.

25:19.604 --> 25:21.939
Just take the movie part.

25:23.274 --> 25:27.695
Always make the Chinese look
so disgracefully bad. You know?

25:29.864 --> 25:33.701
Make me choke with sadness.

25:35.036 --> 25:37.872
<i>You learn very quickly
you are nothing.</i>

25:37.872 --> 25:41.209
Take this knife,
and place it at the throat

25:41.209 --> 25:43.252
of the man who is your father.

25:49.926 --> 25:52.678
So, I'm gonna create an embassy,

25:52.678 --> 25:56.015
my father's <i>qi pai</i> style.

25:56.849 --> 25:58.559
Philosophy. Thinking.

25:58.559 --> 26:00.269
Everything
.

26:03.356 --> 26:05.525
Every detail.

26:05.525 --> 26:07.402
Chic of all chic.

26:07.402 --> 26:09.278
Truth of all truth.

26:09.278 --> 26:12.240
Looking for, every evening,

26:12.240 --> 26:14.492
a performance to transcend.

26:14.492 --> 26:16.035
I said, "What are you gonna do?"
And he said,

26:16.035 --> 26:18.079
"Well, what could
a Chinaman do?"

26:18.079 --> 26:20.915
So, I said, "Run a laundry
or, or a restaurant."

26:20.915 --> 26:22.708
So, I said--
So, he said,

26:22.708 --> 26:25.253
"I'm not gonna do a laundry.
I'm doing a restaurant."

26:26.879 --> 26:30.550
<i>I didn't have any money,
so I found an investor.</i>

26:31.259 --> 26:35.138
<i>All the movie people,
all the walks of arts,</i>

26:35.763 --> 26:37.724
<i>with that connection
to all of them,</i>

26:37.724 --> 26:40.143
<i>it's easy for me
to raise money</i>

26:40.143 --> 26:41.769
<i>and open the restaurant.</i>

26:41.769 --> 26:45.565
<i>It's always a vision
and took off like a rocket.</i>

26:48.276 --> 26:50.778
<i>With the name, Mr. Chow,</i>

26:50.778 --> 26:53.823
because no one
had called him Mr. Chow.

26:56.159 --> 27:00.037
<i>Now, everyone had to call him
Mr. Chow.</i>

27:01.706 --> 27:03.791
Gaby Tana:
<i>He was always
looking to create</i>

27:03.791 --> 27:05.960
a level of, of cuisine

27:05.960 --> 27:09.797
that was so refined and higher
to what people expected.

27:10.256 --> 27:12.592
<i>Michael wanted the food
to be the very best,</i>

27:12.592 --> 27:14.469
<i>so he went to Hong Kong,</i>

27:14.469 --> 27:15.928
testing the chefs.

27:15.928 --> 27:19.348
<i>And he found the chefs there
and he brought them back.</i>

27:19.348 --> 27:23.519
<i>Look, the very
basic principle of cooking,</i>

27:23.519 --> 27:25.897
the bigger the fire,
quicker the seal.

27:25.897 --> 27:27.648
Like my painting.

27:27.648 --> 27:29.776
So we want the fire this big.

27:59.847 --> 28:02.058
<i>In the meantime,
charge a lot. Important.</i>

28:02.683 --> 28:04.769
<i>Because why
should I charge a lot?</i>

28:04.769 --> 28:06.938
<i>Just to create respect.</i>

28:07.355 --> 28:09.065
<i>Respect for my country.</i>

28:09.065 --> 28:12.360
Above all, for my father,
for my parents, for respect.

28:14.278 --> 28:16.239
<i>And then, he explained
this whole thing of,</i>

28:16.239 --> 28:18.616
<i>"You know,
I'm getting all my friends,</i>

28:18.616 --> 28:20.034
<i>"all these great artists,</i>

28:20.034 --> 28:24.038
<i>"and they've all agreed
to give me a painting,</i>

28:24.038 --> 28:26.499
<i>and I'm gonna give them
some free meals."</i>

28:26.499 --> 28:30.336
What it did is it
secured a clientele

28:30.336 --> 28:32.755
that was the best of the best.

28:32.755 --> 28:37.593
He was gonna have,
um, Chinese chefs and cooks,

28:37.593 --> 28:39.637
but Italian waiters.

28:39.929 --> 28:41.889
<i>So, he came up
with a portrait of me</i>

28:41.889 --> 28:44.559
<i>as an old man,
with an old man's body,</i>

28:44.559 --> 28:47.103
<i>with permed hair,
painted me yellow,</i>

28:47.103 --> 28:51.816
<i>and then half Italian,
half Chinese wrestler.</i>

28:52.316 --> 28:55.236
Peter Blake:
<i>Clive made Peking ducks,</i>

28:55.236 --> 28:59.073
<i>which are bronzes, which are
chromed and hang downstairs.</i>

28:59.073 --> 29:01.743
I mean, this lot here
was, uh, Jim Dine.

29:07.874 --> 29:09.250
<i>Well, Michael's
always just had</i>

29:09.250 --> 29:10.877
<i>such an extraordinary aesthetic.</i>

29:10.877 --> 29:13.046
<i>He's such
a brilliant designer.</i>

29:13.046 --> 29:15.506
<i>It was all about the light,</i>

29:15.506 --> 29:18.301
<i>the furniture,
and the detail.</i>

29:18.301 --> 29:20.553
And it was always, you know,
Michael's stage.

29:21.763 --> 29:23.306
<i>Chinese are low of low,</i>

29:23.306 --> 29:26.476
<i>so I wanna show them
we are the chic of chic.</i>

29:26.851 --> 29:30.730
<i>So chic that you don't know
what day it is.</i>

29:30.730 --> 29:33.524
<i>Come and see
my vision of the world</i>

29:33.524 --> 29:35.276
<i>and that beauty</i>

29:35.276 --> 29:38.696
<i>and enjoy my food</i>

29:38.696 --> 29:41.032
the way I would like you
to taste it.

29:41.324 --> 29:44.660
<i>And from day one,
the restaurant was</i>

29:44.660 --> 29:46.704
an amazing hit.
It was crazy.

29:49.082 --> 29:51.751
So all roads lead to Mr. Chow.

29:51.751 --> 29:54.462
The globe is there.
I mean, the world is there.

29:54.796 --> 29:56.923
<i>All the Hollywood is there.</i>

29:58.174 --> 30:00.968
<i>Best models.
Best photographers.</i>

30:00.968 --> 30:03.221
Best everything.
Top, top, top.

30:04.722 --> 30:06.140
<i>All the cool people
in the world,</i>

30:06.140 --> 30:08.184
all gathered here.
Here we are.

30:08.184 --> 30:10.728
And we are in the middle,
and we gonna spin.

30:23.658 --> 30:25.952
interviewer 1:
<i>How long did
the marriage with Grace last?</i>

30:25.952 --> 30:29.288
How long the marriage
last with Grace?

30:30.665 --> 30:32.959
Not very long.
Maybe a year.

30:34.544 --> 30:37.797
<i>Not very long after
we were actually married,</i>

30:37.797 --> 30:40.341
<i>my Vietnamese boyfriend reappeared</i>

30:40.341 --> 30:43.511
and I disappeared out
of Michael's life.

30:43.511 --> 30:46.931
Yeah, I was devastated
when Grace, you know...

30:46.931 --> 30:49.892
I go through the,
"Oh, okay. Here we go again."

30:49.892 --> 30:53.020
And the "Here we go again,"
is the, uh,

30:53.688 --> 30:55.398
panic attack.

30:56.899 --> 30:59.694
<i>Because my mother
abandoned me, right?</i>

31:00.278 --> 31:03.364
<i>So I started relationship
with women very young</i>

31:04.198 --> 31:06.159
<i>and I was very desperate.</i>

31:06.159 --> 31:08.870
<i>I need a partner
to build my castle.</i>

31:08.870 --> 31:10.705
<i>I can't do it on my own.</i>

31:10.705 --> 31:11.998
<i>Once I find a woman,</i>

31:11.998 --> 31:14.959
<i>I know that would be
my foundation,</i>

31:14.959 --> 31:18.212
<i>like my mother,
so when you take that away,</i>

31:18.212 --> 31:20.840
<i>I can't even
get out of the bed.</i>

31:21.215 --> 31:24.135
<i>So, there was a period,
there's nothing.</i>

31:24.135 --> 31:28.598
<i>There's pathetic
kind of a... human.</i>

31:29.140 --> 31:31.976
So, I choose
to escape through movies,

31:31.976 --> 31:35.104
escape through playing cards.

31:35.104 --> 31:37.273
<i>It was
an addiction of his.</i>

31:37.273 --> 31:40.943
<i>You know, he got into his game
and didn't wanna leave,</i>

31:40.943 --> 31:42.945
<i>and it would last all night.</i>

31:43.780 --> 31:46.908
<i>In my case,
I'm a poker player, right?</i>

31:46.908 --> 31:50.328
<i>That feeling of losing
is irreplaceable.</i>

31:52.914 --> 31:56.167
You don't enjoy it.
It's kind of a double-triple,
you know?

31:56.167 --> 31:58.669
And the addiction, you know--
So, but, let's not talk about it

31:58.669 --> 32:01.297
- too, um, too much over that,
but you got the idea. Yeah.
- interviewer 1: Yeah.

32:01.297 --> 32:04.759
- So anyway, where are we?
- interviewer 1: Tokyo.

32:04.759 --> 32:06.594
Tokyo! Okay.

32:07.011 --> 32:10.932
So how I met Tina
was through Japan.

32:20.483 --> 32:23.653
<i>I was fascinated by
Japanese culture at that time</i>

32:24.028 --> 32:26.072
<i>and I was gonna do a movie,</i>

32:26.072 --> 32:29.617
<i>go to Tokyo, and that whole
drama take place there.</i>

32:31.119 --> 32:32.412
<i>Antonio Lopez.</i>

32:32.412 --> 32:35.081
<i>Fantastic fashion illustrator,</i>

32:35.081 --> 32:37.667
<i>chicest man on this planet.</i>

32:38.126 --> 32:40.545
<i>He said to me,
"Oh, you must meet Tina,</i>

32:40.545 --> 32:41.713
<i>you know, who's in Tokyo."</i>

32:41.713 --> 32:45.591
<i>♪ Pink Pop, Pink Pop,
Pink Pop, Pink Pop ♪</i>

32:49.971 --> 32:51.973
Adelle Lutz:
<i>Tina was adorable.</i>

32:51.973 --> 32:53.975
<i>She was 16 years old</i>

32:53.975 --> 32:57.895
<i>when she did her
first Shiseido campaign.</i>

32:57.895 --> 32:59.856
The red lips,

32:59.856 --> 33:02.066
a lot of eye makeup.

33:02.066 --> 33:04.652
<i>- With a baby face,</i>

33:04.652 --> 33:06.654
<i>this tiny little baby face</i>

33:06.654 --> 33:09.115
<i>perched on these long legs.</i>

33:09.115 --> 33:11.659
<i>And we moved to Tokyo</i>

33:11.659 --> 33:14.328
<i>from Bay Village, Ohio.</i>

33:14.328 --> 33:17.999
<i>We'd never met
anyone like him.</i>

33:21.836 --> 33:24.338
<i>He was this thin, skinny guy</i>

33:24.338 --> 33:27.425
<i>with that long black hair.</i>

33:28.384 --> 33:31.345
<i>Tina. First time I saw her,</i>

33:31.345 --> 33:34.140
<i>again, take my breath away,
you know?</i>

33:34.140 --> 33:36.434
<i>She's just an incredible</i>

33:38.352 --> 33:40.104
<i>human.</i>

33:40.104 --> 33:42.523
To put it simplistically.

33:43.399 --> 33:47.153
<i>
I think I could tell
she was attracted to Michael.</i>

33:47.153 --> 33:50.907
<i>She certainly moved to London
pretty quickly.</i>

33:51.491 --> 33:55.620
<i>I was in Paris,
and he called me up,</i>

33:55.620 --> 33:57.580
<i>and he said,</i>

33:57.580 --> 34:00.750
"I'm getting married again."
I said, "Really?"

34:00.750 --> 34:04.921
<i>"Yes," he said. "I want you
to meet my wife-to-be."</i>

34:05.671 --> 34:08.007
<i>To me, she's the most
beautiful woman.</i>

34:08.007 --> 34:10.885
<i>Not just a face beauty,</i>

34:10.885 --> 34:13.262
<i>but it's everything beauty.</i>

34:13.262 --> 34:15.390
<i>You know, Michael was always
blowing his own trumpet</i>

34:15.390 --> 34:18.518
<i>and things like that,
and she took him down a peg.</i>

34:18.518 --> 34:21.938
<i>And they were
an amazing couple.</i>

34:41.249 --> 34:43.584
<i>We got married in London,</i>

34:43.584 --> 34:47.171
<i>and, uh, everybody came,
so the usual suspect came.</i>

34:52.593 --> 34:54.762
Joan Juliet Buck:
<i>And I remember a party here,</i>

34:54.762 --> 34:57.765
<i>and Michael and Tina
receiving right here,</i>

34:57.765 --> 35:02.228
and people came up the stairs
to congratulate them.

35:06.315 --> 35:09.026
<i>Michael was so happy.</i>

35:09.026 --> 35:10.445
He really--

35:10.445 --> 35:14.407
He had
this little perfect family.

35:15.283 --> 35:18.202
That's what I wanted. A home.
That's what I wanted.

35:18.202 --> 35:20.163
And a family, yes.

35:25.126 --> 35:27.628
<i>China, my first child.</i>

35:28.755 --> 35:31.799
<i>The whole experience was</i>

35:33.801 --> 35:35.303
extraordinarily emotional.

35:35.303 --> 35:37.305
You know, I was there

35:37.305 --> 35:41.434
<i>and see China
take her first breath.</i>

35:52.028 --> 35:54.781
<i>And then when Max came along,</i>

35:55.656 --> 35:57.450
<i>even better.</i>

36:19.305 --> 36:22.183
interviewer 1:
<i>Tell me about LA.</i>

36:22.183 --> 36:24.560
How did the whole idea
of LA come about?

36:24.560 --> 36:28.022
Jerry sends me this
very badly typed letter.

36:28.022 --> 36:29.690
<i>He was in south of France.</i>

36:29.690 --> 36:32.944
<i>That's Jerry Moss,
the famous music executive.</i>

36:33.861 --> 36:36.197
<i>The M in A&M Records.</i>

36:36.989 --> 36:41.119
<i>He said, "Would you like
to come to Los Angeles</i>

36:41.119 --> 36:44.372
to open a Mr. Chow?"
Something like that.

36:46.707 --> 36:48.167
Tina goes,

36:48.835 --> 36:51.921
<i>"Wait a minute.
He's the A&M! A&M Records!"</i>

36:52.880 --> 36:54.966
Oh? Okay.

36:54.966 --> 36:56.759
<i>So, Jerry Moss,</i>

36:56.759 --> 36:59.887
<i>he brought me to LA
to open Mr. Chow.</i>

37:12.233 --> 37:16.154
Brian Grazer:
<i>My attraction to Mr. Chow's
was very early.</i>

37:16.154 --> 37:18.698
<i>I just wanted to be in,</i>

37:18.698 --> 37:20.658
because all you have to do
is drive down Canon,

37:20.658 --> 37:23.369
and there's paparazzis
and movie stars and,

37:23.369 --> 37:25.246
<i>"Oh, my God!
There's Gregory Peck!"</i>

37:25.246 --> 37:26.581
<i>You know?</i>

37:26.581 --> 37:30.168
<i>Sunday nights was
Old Hollywood.</i>

37:30.585 --> 37:34.297
<i>Marlon Brando, he'd just
sit there like a Buddha.</i>

37:34.297 --> 37:38.342
<i>The Wilders were there,
Billy and Audrey.</i>

37:39.260 --> 37:41.971
Brian Grazer:
<i>I would be able
to see some of these icons</i>

37:41.971 --> 37:45.308
<i>that were untouchable to me.
Walter Matthau, I mean,</i>

37:45.308 --> 37:47.101
<i>Jack Lemmon would be here.</i>

37:47.101 --> 37:50.104
<i>You know,
the Fondas were here.</i>

37:50.104 --> 37:52.315
From time to time, Mae West.

37:52.732 --> 37:55.443
<i>Mae West would get
the standing ovation,</i>

37:55.443 --> 37:58.112
and she'd just take it in.

37:59.906 --> 38:01.908
More than the dinner.

38:36.442 --> 38:38.152
Practice,
which means <i>kung fu.</i>

38:38.152 --> 38:40.363
- staff: Yes!
Because we are
in the theater,

38:40.363 --> 38:42.573
we are here to entertain.

38:42.573 --> 38:45.368
Let me entertain you.
Am I correct?

38:45.368 --> 38:47.578
- staff: Yes.
The show must go on.

38:47.578 --> 38:50.456
Csabi Szekely:
<i>Six o'clock,
opening the curtain.</i>

38:50.456 --> 38:52.834
<i>They have the maître d',
who is the director.</i>

38:52.834 --> 38:56.462
<i>And then,
you have the caterers.</i>

38:56.462 --> 39:00.049
<i>You have the waiters.
You have the assistant servers.</i>

39:00.049 --> 39:01.467
<i>You have the food runners.</i>

39:01.467 --> 39:02.719
You have the dishwasher,

39:02.719 --> 39:04.804
which is very important
in a restaurant.

39:04.804 --> 39:06.681
<i>And last,
don't forget the chefs.</i>

39:06.681 --> 39:09.475
We deboning the fish
in a special way.

39:09.475 --> 39:11.561
We require skill and elegance,

39:11.561 --> 39:13.604
and skill is part
of the entertainment.

39:13.604 --> 39:15.356
- Yes or no?
- staff: Yes!

39:15.356 --> 39:18.609
Certainly, those guys
making the pasta

39:18.609 --> 39:21.696
<i>and slapping it around
every night, that's a show.</i>

39:22.363 --> 39:25.199
Brian Grazer:
<i>To form the noodle's identity,</i>

39:25.199 --> 39:26.284
<i>and then he cooked the noodle!</i>

39:26.284 --> 39:28.536
<i>So, I mean,
everything is a show!</i>

39:28.536 --> 39:30.747
<i>He's a grand showman.</i>

39:30.747 --> 39:32.707
<i>What does all this adds up to?</i>

39:32.707 --> 39:34.333
Let me tell you
what they add up to.

39:34.333 --> 39:36.544
Adds up to, like all theater,

39:36.544 --> 39:39.213
every night, we are looking to
for transcendence

39:39.213 --> 39:41.382
to a higher place,

39:41.382 --> 39:44.010
to a transcendent
spiritual level.

39:44.010 --> 39:45.511
Yes, you will find it.

39:45.511 --> 39:48.514
So, let's look up what
the negative tendency are.

39:48.514 --> 39:51.517
Negative tendency
for maître d's,

39:51.517 --> 39:52.977
never look at them in the eye.

39:52.977 --> 39:57.148
Good evening.
Hello. This way. Enjoy.

39:57.148 --> 39:59.484
Are you kidding me or what?

39:59.484 --> 40:02.487
Come on.
This restaurant has a leader.

40:02.487 --> 40:06.324
Always. Has a host,
with all eyes on him.

40:06.324 --> 40:08.284
This is theater, okay?

40:24.926 --> 40:28.596
Ian Schrager:
<i>I was, uh, working
in a nightclub studio,</i>

40:28.596 --> 40:32.225
<i>and, uh, there was
like a cultural force</i>

40:32.225 --> 40:33.935
coming over from London,

40:33.935 --> 40:36.229
uh, when Michael was opening
the restaurant.

40:36.229 --> 40:38.022
There was just
an incredible buzz.

40:39.148 --> 40:41.901
<i>There was all of a sudden
a new man about town.</i>

40:41.901 --> 40:45.321
<i>He opened up Mr. Chow's
on 57th Street.</i>

40:45.822 --> 40:49.742
<i>It was in the middle
of the, uh, upper East Side.</i>

40:49.742 --> 40:51.285
<i>You know, you'd go in there,</i>

40:51.285 --> 40:52.578
<i>you'd see this
whole crowd of people</i>

40:52.578 --> 40:54.122
<i>that would be there.</i>

40:54.539 --> 40:55.790
<i>And then, later on at night,</i>

40:55.790 --> 40:58.126
<i>they would go to Studio 54
to party.</i>

40:59.836 --> 41:02.797
I mean it.
If we had a tunnel,
it would be a good thing.

41:02.797 --> 41:06.634
<i>The last party in Studio 54</i>

41:06.634 --> 41:10.054
<i>was by Ian and, uh,
Steve Rubell</i>

41:10.054 --> 41:12.473
<i>for my birthday.</i>

41:12.473 --> 41:14.600
<i>One thousand people.</i>

41:14.600 --> 41:17.228
<i>They were in jail,
singing happy birthday to me.</i>

41:17.228 --> 41:20.690
At that point, Steve and I
were away (laughs) on vacation.

41:23.192 --> 41:24.652
<i>So that era gone down,</i>

41:24.652 --> 41:26.904
and Mr. Chow came up.

41:26.904 --> 41:29.490
Then, everything
went crazily great.

41:38.791 --> 41:42.503
I would hear about Mr. Chow
in Jay-Z songs,

41:42.503 --> 41:44.172
<i>and, uh, Mariah Carey
one time on a video,</i>

41:44.172 --> 41:47.508
she talked about, you know,
going back to Mr. Chow's.

41:47.508 --> 41:49.177
You better be taking me
to Mr. Chow's

41:49.177 --> 41:50.470
for some squab, like, right now.

41:56.350 --> 41:58.853
Brian Grazer:
<i>Well there is a theatricality
to the restaurant</i>

41:58.853 --> 42:02.356
in that, um,
everybody's performing.

42:02.356 --> 42:04.776
That stair.
Like, people stood there.

42:04.776 --> 42:07.111
You-- People stood there
until you looked at them.

42:07.111 --> 42:11.074
<i>And people were always
looking up to see
who's coming in.</i>

42:15.119 --> 42:17.789
<i>There was a huge fashion scene</i>

42:17.789 --> 42:20.041
<i>at the New York restaurant.</i>

42:20.041 --> 42:22.377
<i>Perry Ellis.</i>

42:22.377 --> 42:24.545
<i>Calvin Klein.</i>

42:24.545 --> 42:26.589
<i>Andre Leon Talley.</i>

42:26.589 --> 42:29.300
Fran Lebowitz:
<i>The fact that there were
a lot of fashion people here</i>

42:29.300 --> 42:30.635
<i>was Tina.</i>

42:30.635 --> 42:33.054
<i>Restaurants always wanted
those people, you know,</i>

42:33.054 --> 42:34.889
<i>because they attract
other people.</i>

42:34.889 --> 42:36.140
<i>And they attract
other people</i>

42:36.140 --> 42:39.894
<i>because people
wanna look at them.</i>

42:39.894 --> 42:42.271
<i>You know, restaurants,
they're kind of like</i>

42:42.271 --> 42:44.399
<i>inviting people to your home,</i>

42:44.399 --> 42:47.360
<i>and Tina had a lot of charm.</i>

42:47.360 --> 42:49.070
<i>She was a great hostess.</i>

42:49.070 --> 42:51.739
<i>I mean, people would just
come in to see her basically,</i>

42:51.739 --> 42:55.493
<i>to watch her
because she was so exquisite.</i>

42:55.827 --> 42:58.538
<i>And she made it
always feel like a party.</i>

42:58.538 --> 43:01.749
<i>And the champagne
would just flow.</i>

43:01.749 --> 43:04.377
<i>To me, it was Tina.
But also,</i>

43:04.377 --> 43:07.255
<i>we weren't
welcomed everywhere.
You know,</i>

43:07.255 --> 43:08.256
girls sat on girls' laps.

43:08.256 --> 43:11.342
I was thrown out of a restaurant
because of that.

43:11.342 --> 43:13.052
LL Cool J:
<i>Well, I'm from
Queens, New York.</i>

43:13.052 --> 43:15.096
<i>I grew up in a city
in the hood.</i>

43:15.096 --> 43:17.724
<i>So, coming here was
like a statement, you know,</i>

43:17.724 --> 43:20.017
'cause we was Red Lobster,
you know what I'm saying?

43:20.017 --> 43:22.520
We was going
to Red Lobster. Sizzler.

43:22.520 --> 43:24.772
Oh, they got the bread!
Tony Roma's.

43:24.772 --> 43:25.940
You know what I'm saying?

43:25.940 --> 43:27.608
Like, it was that world.
You know?

43:27.608 --> 43:29.902
And Mr. Chow's, for us,

43:30.319 --> 43:31.487
<i>felt like a step up.</i>

43:31.487 --> 43:32.780
<i>It represented kinda</i>

43:32.780 --> 43:35.533
<i>a doorway to the
American Dream, so to speak.</i>

43:36.117 --> 43:38.119
<i>You know, a lot of people
that try to be high-class,</i>

43:38.119 --> 43:41.038
they always wanna shy away
from Blacks or Latinos

43:41.038 --> 43:44.959
or people that, you know,
come from a regular place.

43:44.959 --> 43:46.627
<i>When you come to Mr. Chow's,</i>

43:46.627 --> 43:48.796
<i>they're not giving you grief
about hats.</i>

43:48.796 --> 43:50.214
Like, I went to Mastro's.
They're like,

43:50.214 --> 43:51.841
"Oh, yes, but you have
to take off your hat."

43:51.841 --> 43:54.761
Take off my hat?
What does that
have to do with anything?

43:54.761 --> 43:56.304
Am I paying my bill?

43:57.889 --> 44:00.475
Good evening.
Annina's waiting for you.

44:00.475 --> 44:02.810
Bruno Bischofberger:
Jean! Jean!

44:10.693 --> 44:13.362
Mr. Chow.
A chair, please.

44:14.906 --> 44:16.866
To a great show, Jean.

44:16.866 --> 44:20.536
- Artistic vanguard
in New York City

44:20.536 --> 44:23.498
was always downtown.

44:23.790 --> 44:28.002
And it was really through
Michael and Tina

44:28.002 --> 44:30.880
<i>and their interest
in the art world</i>

44:30.880 --> 44:34.467
<i>that they drew the artists
here to Mr. Chow.</i>

44:36.052 --> 44:39.639
<i>There's that book
filled with artists' drawings</i>

44:40.306 --> 44:43.518
<i>and he's been collecting for
years and nurturing artists.</i>

45:04.247 --> 45:08.126
Jeffrey Deitch:
<i>Michael's portrait collection,
which is amazing,</i>

45:08.835 --> 45:11.421
<i>it could be a museum.</i>

45:16.467 --> 45:17.885
Ed Ruscha:
<i>As I recall,</i>

45:17.885 --> 45:21.431
<i>there wasn't money exchanged.</i>

45:21.431 --> 45:23.933
More like an exchange of food

45:23.933 --> 45:26.561
and services at the restaurant.

45:27.061 --> 45:30.189
<i>The Ed Ruscha portrait
of Mr. Chow,</i>

45:30.189 --> 45:33.568
<i>it shows the genius
of Ed Ruscha</i>

45:33.568 --> 45:35.778
<i>as a conceptualist,</i>

45:35.778 --> 45:39.449
<i>and to create the portrait
out of ingredients</i>

45:39.449 --> 45:41.159
<i>used in Mr. Chow's cooking.</i>

45:41.159 --> 45:43.745
Ed Ruscha:
<i>Soy sauce refused to dry,</i>

45:43.745 --> 45:45.955
<i>but it was still stable.</i>

45:46.330 --> 45:48.040
<i>I think there was
a secret element</i>

45:48.040 --> 45:49.625
<i>and so much time has passed</i>

45:49.625 --> 45:53.546
that not even the artist can
remember what that secret is.

45:54.088 --> 45:57.925
Kevin Lipton:
<i>Mr. Chow is a character
created by him.</i>

45:59.677 --> 46:04.015
<i>It was emblazoned on
a million packages of matches.</i>

46:04.974 --> 46:07.560
Well, the way I would describe
Mr. Chow, the character,

46:07.560 --> 46:09.020
is the same green guy

46:09.020 --> 46:11.522
<i>sitting in a bowl of noodles
because that's what it is.</i>

46:11.522 --> 46:13.357
<i>It's a caricature of the man</i>

46:13.357 --> 46:16.694
<i>who doesn't want
people to know
who he really is.</i>

46:17.320 --> 46:20.698
<i>Andy, he gets
Mr. Chow perfectly.</i>

46:20.698 --> 46:23.701
<i>He divined this mystery</i>

46:23.701 --> 46:27.038
<i>that's inherent to
Michael's personality.</i>

46:27.455 --> 46:31.292
<i>It's Mr. Chow
and the shadow of Mr. Chow.</i>

46:32.043 --> 46:33.169
<i>Andy Warhol,</i>

46:33.169 --> 46:37.465
<i>during his journey
of struggle in life,</i>

46:37.924 --> 46:41.594
<i>he learned two words,
and the two words are</i>

46:41.594 --> 46:43.721
"So what?"

46:44.389 --> 46:46.140
And the minute he got
the, "So what,"

46:46.140 --> 46:48.643
he went, "Whoa!"
He have freedom.

46:58.486 --> 47:02.323
<i>Jean-Michel, Michel, Michel,
my darling Jean-Michel, um...</i>

47:03.241 --> 47:07.245
<i>Apart from my portrait,
which I gave him food,</i>

47:07.245 --> 47:09.330
I bought a few paintings
from him

47:09.330 --> 47:11.457
for about $15,000
or something,

47:11.457 --> 47:14.001
but that's already
gone up a little bit.

47:14.377 --> 47:16.629
<i>I remember a number of times</i>

47:16.629 --> 47:18.423
<i>standing with
Jean-Michel Basquiat
on the street</i>

47:18.423 --> 47:21.384
trying to get a cab,
and every cab would pass.

47:21.384 --> 47:24.679
<i>They didn't wanna pick him up
with his dreadlocks,</i>

47:24.679 --> 47:27.473
<i>but here in uptown New York,</i>

47:27.473 --> 47:29.517
<i>he was 100% welcomed.</i>

47:30.226 --> 47:33.438
<i>I think then Mr. Chow
was a safe place</i>

47:33.438 --> 47:35.148
for a lot of people,

47:35.148 --> 47:37.942
but specifically
for Jean-Michel, yeah.

47:39.277 --> 47:41.487
<i>Because it was in a place
that the more artistic</i>

47:41.487 --> 47:45.116
<i>and the more odd you were,
the more comfortable you felt.</i>

47:46.117 --> 47:48.995
<i>Michael and Jean-Michel
had a lot in common.</i>

47:48.995 --> 47:51.914
<i>Both had to make it
on their own.</i>

47:51.914 --> 47:55.001
<i>Jean-Michel, who lived
in the streets of New York</i>

47:55.001 --> 47:56.210
<i>for some time, and Michael,</i>

47:56.210 --> 48:00.214
<i>he had to invent
a whole new persona.</i>

48:00.214 --> 48:03.092
<i>So, Jean-Michel is
the same thing.</i>

48:03.384 --> 48:07.055
He is so focused

48:08.431 --> 48:10.641
on this racism thing.

48:11.642 --> 48:12.894
<i>It's beautiful.</i>

48:14.395 --> 48:17.732
<i>It's a little bit like</i>
qi <i>style like my father.</i>

48:18.066 --> 48:21.069
One side,
very violent and heavy.

48:21.069 --> 48:23.988
The other one,
tender and gentle.

48:25.031 --> 48:28.910
<i>So, that is the basis</i>

48:28.910 --> 48:32.747
<i>of our connection.</i>

48:33.539 --> 48:37.460
<i>You know, I was unaware
of racial problems, I guess,</i>

48:37.460 --> 48:40.713
<i>until one day,
I wanted to get a cab home,</i>

48:40.713 --> 48:44.258
and I said, "Oh, come with me
to the hotel down here.

48:44.258 --> 48:46.928
I'll ask the doorman,
and he'll get us the cab."

48:46.928 --> 48:48.346
<i>And he said,</i>

48:48.346 --> 48:50.598
<i>"The doorman will never
get a cab if I'm with you."</i>

48:50.598 --> 48:52.934
<i>And I said,
"What are you talking about?</i>

48:52.934 --> 48:55.103
<i>You're Michael Chow."
You know?</i>

48:55.103 --> 48:58.272
The problem with racism,
it hurts.

48:59.816 --> 49:01.484
Mm.

49:02.777 --> 49:05.113
Yeah. You're low of low,

49:05.113 --> 49:07.281
are reminded again and again,

49:07.281 --> 49:09.659
and then again.
All the time, nonstop.

49:09.659 --> 49:11.452
The doorman kept
pushing us aside

49:11.452 --> 49:14.914
and giving somebody else
the cab, like this.

49:14.914 --> 49:17.625
If you take away my glasses,

49:19.001 --> 49:22.296
you take away my big tipping,

49:23.840 --> 49:26.134
and take away my Rolls Royce,

49:28.886 --> 49:30.805
I'm not good enough now.

49:30.805 --> 49:33.141
But, if I have my glasses,

49:33.808 --> 49:36.102
if I drive a Rolls Royce,

49:37.145 --> 49:39.814
if I go and buy for the moment,

49:40.523 --> 49:43.234
if I give anybody $100,
they will start smiling.

49:43.234 --> 49:46.487
They say, "Mr. Chow, this way."
They even call me Mr. Chow.

49:46.487 --> 49:50.366
It's very difficult
to be kind and real.
Very difficult.

49:50.366 --> 49:53.035
Because we are usually afraid,

49:53.035 --> 49:55.246
but if you practice that,

49:55.788 --> 49:57.248
you become a better human being.

49:57.248 --> 49:59.751
For instance, I said to them,

50:01.502 --> 50:04.380
"When I come in, I want
everybody to say hello to me."

50:04.380 --> 50:06.507
They think because
I need people to come--

50:06.507 --> 50:09.177
No, no, I don't need people
to come in to me, okay?

50:09.177 --> 50:10.511
I want them to say hello to me

50:10.511 --> 50:14.348
because I want them
to practice with me.

50:14.348 --> 50:17.477
Because they don't know
how to say hello to me.

50:17.477 --> 50:19.395
Because they give me
a phony, you see?

50:19.395 --> 50:21.647
Just like-- Back to
Marlon Brando again.

50:21.647 --> 50:24.150
When Marlon Brando
go on the set first time

50:24.150 --> 50:28.071
in this particular movie,
want to test the director.

50:28.071 --> 50:30.114
He gave him two performances.

50:30.114 --> 50:32.366
One performance,
second performance,

50:32.366 --> 50:35.495
see which performance
the director take.

50:35.495 --> 50:38.956
If the director is no good,
he give him a phony one.

50:38.956 --> 50:41.250
He say,
"Mama! Would you come to me?"

50:41.250 --> 50:43.211
The director say,
"Oh, sensational."

50:43.211 --> 50:44.712
And first one, he say,

50:48.383 --> 50:49.884
"Mom..."

50:51.636 --> 50:53.554
"Cut! No, no, no! Not that one!
I want,

50:53.554 --> 50:56.432
'Mama! Please come to me!'"
He said,

50:56.432 --> 50:58.184
"Fuck you.
The rest of the movie,

50:58.184 --> 51:00.061
you're gonna have a hard time
from me, okay?"

51:00.061 --> 51:01.813
Marlon says. Okay?

51:01.813 --> 51:03.689
Now, to be real is important.

51:03.689 --> 51:05.650
To be real--

51:05.650 --> 51:07.360
First, you have to unload.

51:07.360 --> 51:09.904
<i>Not just in the restaurant.</i>

51:09.904 --> 51:12.198
<i>I want them go home in life,</i>

51:12.198 --> 51:14.492
<i>while they're driving
down the road</i>

51:14.492 --> 51:16.285
<i>with a cop
coming up to him,</i>

51:16.285 --> 51:18.788
<i>they become confident
in themselves</i>

51:18.788 --> 51:20.957
<i>because they are real.</i>

51:20.957 --> 51:23.084
<i>I want to share</i>

51:23.084 --> 51:26.003
<i>that human experience
with them,</i>

51:26.003 --> 51:29.257
so that they're not
afraid of anyone.

51:29.257 --> 51:31.426
Who been here longest?

51:31.426 --> 51:34.971
- Phil! Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Phil.

51:36.973 --> 51:40.435
Phil, how long you been here?

51:40.435 --> 51:42.186
- Forty-seven.
Uh-huh.

51:42.186 --> 51:44.772
- Next January, gonna be 48.
Wow.

51:44.772 --> 51:46.566
<i>Phil's been working with me</i>

51:46.566 --> 51:49.527
<i>since the day
the restaurant opened.</i>

51:49.527 --> 51:52.488
<i>He is extraordinary good man.</i>

51:52.488 --> 51:54.657
He had this Zen thing, right?

51:54.657 --> 51:58.703
He's low-key, s--
Incredible guy, you know?

52:01.831 --> 52:05.626
Only thing I get from him,

52:05.626 --> 52:09.797
which is painful, is make me
feel not very good man.

52:13.009 --> 52:15.386
From time to time.

52:15.386 --> 52:18.806
So, when you meet
a really good man,

52:18.806 --> 52:20.725
you feel like a asshole.

52:20.725 --> 52:23.102
You follow me?

52:23.102 --> 52:27.190
<i>In my world,
one, prepare to eat better.</i>

52:27.857 --> 52:31.903
<i>Two, you have to be
prepared to be an asshole,</i>

52:31.903 --> 52:34.030
<i>but asshole with a twist, okay?</i>

52:34.030 --> 52:37.158
Not normal asshole.
Specialized asshole.

52:37.700 --> 52:41.162
Mr. Chow taught me
to stand up for myself.

52:41.162 --> 52:44.207
I-I don't take shit from nobody.

52:44.207 --> 52:46.250
Another thing is
when you pick up the napkin,

52:46.250 --> 52:48.294
we want to be economical
in one movement,

52:48.294 --> 52:49.879
so we have to study
all this shit, okay?

52:49.879 --> 52:51.339
Every detail
is the universe.

52:51.339 --> 52:55.176
So, we go to the napkin,
and we'll go like this...

52:55.176 --> 52:58.346
Brian Murati:
<i>Staff meeting at 5:30, line up.</i>

52:58.346 --> 53:01.432
<i>Everybody must line up
with the aprons</i>

53:01.432 --> 53:03.851
<i>matching to the ankle.
Everyone the same.</i>

53:03.851 --> 53:07.271
Mr. Chow always believed
in details, details, details.

53:07.271 --> 53:09.482
Yes, details.
"All details are universe."

53:09.482 --> 53:10.983
That's what Mr. Chow says.

53:10.983 --> 53:13.694
Example, every detail
in the universe.

53:15.196 --> 53:17.073
Cut to Karl Lagerfeld.

53:17.407 --> 53:19.992
<i>He said, "What you got there?"
I said, "My bow tie."</i>

53:20.701 --> 53:24.372
<i>He said, "You're wearing
a clip-on bow tie?</i>

53:24.372 --> 53:28.042
"You wearing a--
Are you out of your mind?
Give it to me.

53:28.042 --> 53:30.545
"Give it to me!
Take this.

53:30.545 --> 53:33.089
Never wear a clip-on
bow tie, okay?"

53:33.715 --> 53:35.007
"But, no, no!
You don't understand!

53:35.007 --> 53:37.844
<i>It's very difficult to tie
the fucking bow tie."</i>

53:37.844 --> 53:40.471
<i>You know what?
In Mr. Chow right now,
you go there,</i>

53:40.471 --> 53:42.890
<i>everyone all hand-tied.</i>

53:43.349 --> 53:46.811
How do you navigate
somebody who has strong views?

53:46.811 --> 53:48.646
Uh, you listen.

53:48.646 --> 53:51.232
I think that that's the,
the key.

53:51.232 --> 53:52.984
I remember
when I first came here,

53:52.984 --> 53:56.612
there was a periscope
coming down from the ceiling.

53:56.612 --> 53:58.906
And I asked people,
"What is that?"

53:58.906 --> 54:00.908
"Oh, Mr. Chow lives upstairs,

54:00.908 --> 54:03.995
so he can watch over everything
through the periscope."

54:05.747 --> 54:09.125
China Chow:
<i>My father had
this big lacquer desk,</i>

54:09.125 --> 54:13.337
and there was this console with
a, uh, remote control camera.

54:14.422 --> 54:16.132
Please come in, Mr. Fisher.

54:16.132 --> 54:18.718
- Mr. Osato is expecting you.
- Thank you.

54:18.718 --> 54:20.595
<i>My father was
in a James Bond film.</i>

54:20.595 --> 54:23.931
<i>"You Only Live Twice."
He played Spectre 4.</i>

54:23.931 --> 54:27.185
<i>And so, when they would
go to the restaurant,</i>

54:27.185 --> 54:29.520
<i>Max and I would go
and we would
spy with the camera</i>

54:29.520 --> 54:31.189
<i>and see what was happening.</i>

54:31.939 --> 54:33.816
<i>We would get up,
get on the joystick,</i>

54:33.816 --> 54:35.651
and you'd be panning
across the restaurant.

54:37.779 --> 54:40.490
<i>And then,
you'd just see my dad
looking at the camera,</i>

54:40.490 --> 54:42.950
<i>and you'd be like, "Okay,
it's time to go to bed."</i>

54:43.743 --> 54:46.537
He really created
this viewing space,

54:46.537 --> 54:48.414
a little bit like
the Wizard of Oz.

54:48.414 --> 54:52.126
That's when Michael
wanted to watch the restaurant

54:52.126 --> 54:55.088
rather than be
in the restaurant.

54:55.630 --> 54:57.465
<i>How do you get
inside Michael Chow?</i>

54:57.465 --> 54:59.675
<i>What's really there?</i>

54:59.675 --> 55:04.138
With the tragedy of
what happened in Shanghai,

55:04.639 --> 55:07.141
th-there is a deep
sadness inside.

55:07.141 --> 55:13.189
I found out about what had
happened to my family, um,

55:13.731 --> 55:16.109
through bits and pieces,
I think, similar to my dad.

55:16.109 --> 55:17.485
I'll say this.

55:17.485 --> 55:20.113
It's not a mistake
that my name's China.

55:29.914 --> 55:33.000
<i>I know that I come
from a family</i>

55:33.000 --> 55:35.128
<i>that's had a lot of history.</i>

55:36.879 --> 55:40.758
<i>And that history is both important</i>

55:42.009 --> 55:43.219
<i>and heartbreaking.</i>

55:49.308 --> 55:51.519
<i>Chinese Cultural Revolution.</i>

55:51.519 --> 55:54.355
That time, no one knew
wh-- what it really was.

55:58.568 --> 56:02.113
<i>In the summer of 1966,</i>

56:02.780 --> 56:06.409
<i>started with
the Red Guards in the truck.</i>

56:06.409 --> 56:08.786
<i>They came after my father.</i>

56:08.786 --> 56:11.789
First thing, they came in,
they kill the dog.

56:12.039 --> 56:16.461
<i>And then it's
group after group
of Red Guards.</i>

56:18.046 --> 56:20.048
Obviously, it's a great tragedy.

56:20.048 --> 56:22.633
Not just my family,
but my family in particular

56:22.633 --> 56:25.428
because my father's name
is so big,

56:25.428 --> 56:28.056
<i>he was the first one
to be purged, so to speak.</i>

56:29.766 --> 56:32.268
<i>They came and condemned him,
saying that,</i>

56:32.268 --> 56:34.437
<i>"You are
a counter-revolutionary."</i>

56:34.812 --> 56:37.065
<i>And my father
pounded the table, saying,</i>

56:37.065 --> 56:39.484
<i>"No! I will not accept it."</i>

56:39.901 --> 56:42.528
<i>And my grandfather
was thrown in jail</i>

56:43.362 --> 56:46.491
<i>and spent many, many,
many years there.</i>

56:47.658 --> 56:50.995
<i>And my Uncle William
was thrown in jail.</i>

56:51.621 --> 56:54.791
<i>William, he was arrested</i>

56:54.791 --> 56:57.543
<i>because he talked
about Jiang Qin.</i>

56:57.543 --> 57:01.672
<i>And that was a slander
of Chairman Mao's wife.</i>

57:04.175 --> 57:07.053
I remember sitting with Michael.

57:07.053 --> 57:08.971
It was just the two of us.

57:08.971 --> 57:11.766
He had this small voice.

57:11.766 --> 57:15.603
"William has been in prison
for eight years.

57:15.603 --> 57:17.939
William ha--"
Over and over.

57:18.272 --> 57:19.524
After 10 years

57:19.524 --> 57:23.277
<i>of criticizing him</i>

57:24.237 --> 57:25.696
<i>and being alone,</i>

57:25.696 --> 57:28.991
<i>house arrested by himself
for so many years,</i>

57:28.991 --> 57:30.618
he got sick.

57:30.618 --> 57:33.371
And then,
he died in the hospital.

57:33.621 --> 57:36.290
It's a great deal
of suffering, but so what?

57:36.290 --> 57:38.835
I don't mean, "So what"
in, uh, in, uh--

57:38.835 --> 57:40.461
In, "My mother
got beaten to death."

57:40.461 --> 57:41.838
What do you want me to say?

57:41.838 --> 57:43.005
Wh-What--

57:43.005 --> 57:45.216
You know,
there are other people suffered.

57:45.216 --> 57:46.551
Everybody suffered.

57:46.551 --> 57:49.554
Tragedy or family tragedy,

57:49.554 --> 57:51.889
no one want to talk about it.

57:51.889 --> 57:55.059
That's how we all
each handled it,

57:55.059 --> 57:57.645
in our own way to survive.

57:57.645 --> 57:59.564
The problem there is

57:59.564 --> 58:03.526
when you don't mourn
somebody properly,

58:03.526 --> 58:05.528
it stay with you forever.

58:13.494 --> 58:15.621
<i>After the Cultural Revolution,</i>

58:15.621 --> 58:18.958
<i>William wants to leave China.</i>

58:18.958 --> 58:22.920
<i>So, Michael decided that
they can settle in New York</i>

58:23.421 --> 58:25.840
and he will support them.

58:26.674 --> 58:28.551
<i>This is 1981.</i>

58:28.551 --> 58:30.511
<i>William came out of China,</i>

58:30.511 --> 58:33.806
<i>and I put on Beijing Opera
in Lincoln Center</i>

58:33.806 --> 58:37.351
<i>to honor my father
with my brother performing</i>

58:37.351 --> 58:39.228
<i>in his role.</i>

58:39.854 --> 58:42.523
<i>William was beautiful.</i>

58:42.523 --> 58:45.610
<i>Very, very refined.
Sort of like...</i>

58:45.610 --> 58:48.196
like a great duke.

58:48.946 --> 58:51.574
<i>William taught me
a lot about</i> qi <i>style.</i>

58:51.574 --> 58:54.410
<i>In fact, I had
an Andy Warhol interview</i>

58:54.410 --> 58:56.746
<i>with Tina and me.</i>

58:56.746 --> 58:57.997
Andy Warhol:
<i>Your brother's an actor.</i>

58:57.997 --> 59:00.249
How come you never
became an actor?

59:00.249 --> 59:04.087
I always wanted to be, but never
had the opportunity. And then--

59:04.087 --> 59:07.048
Well, you left, left Shanghai
at such an early age.

59:07.048 --> 59:09.342
Left when I was 13,
was already too late.

59:09.342 --> 59:11.052
How did your brother stay on?

59:11.052 --> 59:14.222
Well, he-he's older than me,
so he's the number one son.

59:14.222 --> 59:16.724
- Tina Chow: So, he had
the proper training.
Yeah. And he's still--

59:16.724 --> 59:19.060
Very strict
training, too.
Yeah.

59:19.060 --> 59:23.606
So, he stayed on and, uh,
followed my father's footstep.

59:25.316 --> 59:29.237
<i>Then, we go into early '80s
where my brother came out</i>

59:29.237 --> 59:31.406
<i>with his wife Jane</i>

59:31.406 --> 59:34.033
and his two daughter,

59:34.033 --> 59:36.744
who also suffered

59:36.744 --> 59:40.873
during that period.
Dark period.

59:42.166 --> 59:44.293
<i>And they lived on
the 10th floor apartment</i>

59:44.293 --> 59:46.087
<i>which I set it all up,</i>

59:46.087 --> 59:49.173
<i>ready for them, you know,
with loving care.</i>

59:50.883 --> 59:53.928
As usual, down to a

59:55.430 --> 59:58.099
bar of soap, so to speak.

59:59.851 --> 01:00:02.103
Cut a very long story short,

01:00:05.064 --> 01:00:07.108
she jumped.

01:00:11.529 --> 01:00:13.698
<i>When his niece took her life,</i>

01:00:13.698 --> 01:00:15.992
that really was the straw
that broke the camel's back

01:00:15.992 --> 01:00:18.828
for, for Michael
and for all of them.

01:00:18.828 --> 01:00:21.205
I mean, you never heal
from something like that.

01:00:21.205 --> 01:00:24.792
And I was the one chosen,
I don't know why,

01:00:24.792 --> 01:00:28.421
to the morgue to see her,
and that affect me a great deal.

01:00:30.882 --> 01:00:33.259
<i>And at that time, Michael,</i>

01:00:33.259 --> 01:00:35.762
<i>he wanted to stay upstairs.</i>

01:00:36.137 --> 01:00:39.807
<i>And, uh, basically, she would
come down in the evenings</i>

01:00:39.807 --> 01:00:42.852
<i>and check how everything,
you know,</i>

01:00:42.852 --> 01:00:45.438
<i>and looking extraordinary</i>

01:00:45.438 --> 01:00:47.899
<i>and swinging with the people,</i>

01:00:47.899 --> 01:00:49.859
<i>and that upset him
all the more, I think.</i>

01:00:49.859 --> 01:00:52.070
<i>It was carrying on without him,
you know?</i>

01:00:54.197 --> 01:00:57.575
<i>As he retreated,
and she just kind of went out</i>

01:00:57.575 --> 01:01:00.369
<i>and was much more
of a public person</i>

01:01:00.369 --> 01:01:01.788
<i>than ever before.</i>

01:01:01.788 --> 01:01:04.123
<i>They, they sort of moved apart.</i>

01:01:04.957 --> 01:01:08.169
<i>Tina is extraordinary.</i>

01:01:09.504 --> 01:01:10.880
<i>Physically,</i>

01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:14.217
<i>and internally, externally,
beautiful woman. You know?</i>

01:01:15.718 --> 01:01:18.721
<i>Style, the whole thing.</i>

01:01:18.721 --> 01:01:21.182
Lot of desire from others, right?

01:01:32.735 --> 01:01:34.570
<i>Weird pictures of Tina</i>

01:01:34.570 --> 01:01:37.990
<i>all wrapped up in rope
and things.</i>

01:01:38.366 --> 01:01:40.618
I hate that picture.

01:01:40.618 --> 01:01:42.537
It was ugly!

01:01:42.870 --> 01:01:45.790
<i>Helmut Newton,
he saw Michael and Tina</i>

01:01:45.790 --> 01:01:49.711
<i>as Tina, the trussed-up
property of Michael.</i>

01:01:50.378 --> 01:01:53.047
<i>I mean, If you really
wanna get into it,</i>

01:01:54.173 --> 01:01:57.218
<i>I'm Fu Manchu,
and she's tied-up slave.</i>

01:01:57.677 --> 01:01:59.303
<i>In film noir, you always have</i>

01:01:59.303 --> 01:02:01.639
this cynical Chinese
in the background, right?

01:02:01.639 --> 01:02:05.017
"Okay, I admit.
I'm the evil guy." Okay?

01:02:05.017 --> 01:02:07.979
Because I look like this.
You know? Whatever.

01:02:09.605 --> 01:02:11.774
Am I-- I don't know.
And you say to me,

01:02:11.774 --> 01:02:14.360
"Oh, why you so obsessed
with this racism thing?"

01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:17.739
Well, if I don't upset with it,
who's going to do it?

01:02:19.949 --> 01:02:22.493
<i>Michael had disappeared</i>

01:02:22.493 --> 01:02:25.371
<i>out of not only the restaurant,</i>

01:02:25.371 --> 01:02:28.458
<i>but I think they were
living together,</i>

01:02:28.458 --> 01:02:30.543
<i>but it wasn't working</i>

01:02:30.543 --> 01:02:33.087
<i>as a family very well.</i>

01:02:33.087 --> 01:02:37.425
And then, Tina had an affair

01:02:40.011 --> 01:02:43.931
<i>and they moved to LA.</i>

01:02:44.599 --> 01:02:47.268
It was so sad. I don't know,
apart from the stuff

01:02:47.268 --> 01:02:50.605
that was, you know, published,
in terms of infidelities,

01:02:50.605 --> 01:02:52.148
I don't think that helped.

01:02:52.148 --> 01:02:56.152
And I think there was a layer
of, uh, public nature to that,

01:02:56.152 --> 01:02:58.321
that Michael didn't care for,

01:02:58.321 --> 01:03:01.908
that I think he felt, uh,
embarrassed by.

01:03:02.575 --> 01:03:04.869
Because Tina
belong to New York,

01:03:04.869 --> 01:03:06.204
it's territorial now.

01:03:06.204 --> 01:03:07.955
Now, we're dealing
with territorial.

01:03:07.955 --> 01:03:11.334
They wanna make me
into the villain, right?

01:03:11.334 --> 01:03:14.003
Because the whole community
want to make a villain,

01:03:14.003 --> 01:03:16.339
so the villain must be me.

01:03:18.883 --> 01:03:21.010
When it's not true.

01:03:21.010 --> 01:03:23.805
Well, I was very young
when we left New York.

01:03:23.805 --> 01:03:25.306
<i>I think we left New York
in order for them</i>

01:03:25.306 --> 01:03:27.934
<i>to try and salvage
the relationship,</i>

01:03:27.934 --> 01:03:30.311
<i>and, uh, that was around 1985.</i>

01:03:30.311 --> 01:03:32.313
<i>I was probably around
7 years old.</i>

01:03:32.313 --> 01:03:35.274
<i>He wanted to move to LA.
That's why LA really happened,</i>

01:03:35.274 --> 01:03:39.529
and Tina didn't really
wanna move to LA.

01:03:39.529 --> 01:03:42.990
And at that time,
I abandoned my children even--

01:03:42.990 --> 01:03:45.535
Not abandoned my children,
but I can't deal with it.

01:03:45.535 --> 01:03:46.994
You know, can't deal with it.

01:03:46.994 --> 01:03:49.497
So, I'm looking for a cure,
looking for cure,

01:03:49.497 --> 01:03:50.998
biding time, looking for a cure.

01:03:50.998 --> 01:03:52.792
What time is it? Biding.

01:03:52.792 --> 01:03:54.794
Looking for a cure.

01:03:55.253 --> 01:03:58.297
<i>Again, I didn't know
what, what is depression,</i>

01:03:58.297 --> 01:04:01.467
<i>you know, so, but I obviously
suffer from depression.</i>

01:04:01.467 --> 01:04:03.845
I think that there was
a lot of stuff at home,

01:04:03.845 --> 01:04:05.263
on, you know, both fronts,

01:04:05.263 --> 01:04:09.016
my-- both parents,
uh, that it was just

01:04:10.184 --> 01:04:11.769
easier to be in boarding school.

01:04:21.195 --> 01:04:23.030
<i>It was difficult
for a lot of people,</i>

01:04:23.030 --> 01:04:25.324
because everybody loves them

01:04:25.324 --> 01:04:27.410
and didn't wanna see
this happening.

01:04:27.994 --> 01:04:29.620
<i>And then, of course,
the most heartbreaking</i>

01:04:29.620 --> 01:04:31.372
<i>was then
when she got sick.</i>

01:04:31.372 --> 01:04:32.790
<i>I was living in Paris
at the time,</i>

01:04:32.790 --> 01:04:34.292
<i>and she called me from Japan</i>

01:04:34.292 --> 01:04:36.711
<i>where she was
when she found out.</i>

01:04:36.711 --> 01:04:39.005
And I just couldn't believe it.

01:04:39.005 --> 01:04:40.840
I remember when Tina was sick,
and I remember

01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:43.009
people were shocked
that she was sick,

01:04:43.009 --> 01:04:45.762
because we weren't used to
women getting it. That's true.

01:04:45.762 --> 01:04:48.848
And we were--

01:04:48.848 --> 01:04:52.727
had friends who
were clearly already

01:04:52.727 --> 01:04:55.938
living with AIDS
and, and dying.

01:04:56.230 --> 01:04:59.025
<i>Antonio and Juan were sick,</i>

01:04:59.025 --> 01:05:02.361
<i>and so many of the guys,
they were dying</i>

01:05:02.361 --> 01:05:04.405
in horrible ways

01:05:04.405 --> 01:05:07.825
of a disease that had tremendous
stigma attached to it.

01:05:07.825 --> 01:05:09.952
Even today, I get,
I get upset

01:05:09.952 --> 01:05:12.497
by having lost so many friends.

01:05:12.747 --> 01:05:15.708
<i>I mean,
a whole group of people,</i>

01:05:15.708 --> 01:05:17.752
<i>creative, brilliant people.</i>

01:05:17.752 --> 01:05:19.253
We lost so many of them.

01:05:19.253 --> 01:05:22.131
There was also a lot of anger.
And so, people would often say,

01:05:22.131 --> 01:05:23.424
"Tina got it from this person--"

01:05:23.424 --> 01:05:25.426
And I would say,
"You know what? Who cares?"

01:05:25.426 --> 01:05:27.053
And that's a horrible thing
to say,

01:05:27.053 --> 01:05:29.597
because whoever she got it from
did not do it deliberately.

01:05:29.597 --> 01:05:31.516
When I heard that she was sick,

01:05:31.516 --> 01:05:32.934
<i>I went to visit her,</i>

01:05:32.934 --> 01:05:35.603
<i>and she was very surprised
to see me.</i>

01:05:35.603 --> 01:05:38.064
<i>She was in good spirits,</i>

01:05:38.064 --> 01:05:39.774
and she even had the feeling

01:05:39.774 --> 01:05:42.610
that she would get well.

01:05:42.610 --> 01:05:44.487
She would get well.

01:05:55.039 --> 01:05:57.083
<i>After Tina died,</i>

01:05:57.083 --> 01:06:01.087
a theater director friend
rang me, and she said,

01:06:01.087 --> 01:06:03.965
"Do you know how important

01:06:03.965 --> 01:06:07.260
"your sister's obituary was

01:06:07.260 --> 01:06:09.971
in 'The New York Times'?"

01:06:09.971 --> 01:06:13.349
Because no one admitted

01:06:13.349 --> 01:06:17.311
to having AIDS,
and the family said,

01:06:17.979 --> 01:06:20.481
"This is how she died."

01:06:20.481 --> 01:06:22.233
And they, I think,

01:06:22.233 --> 01:06:25.570
might possibly have never
covered a woman.

01:06:29.907 --> 01:06:32.493
She was very brave.

01:06:41.669 --> 01:06:44.547
interviewer 1:
How was it for you
when she died?

01:07:06.110 --> 01:07:10.364
The 30 seconds of silence
says it all.

01:07:11.616 --> 01:07:13.701
It is what it is.

01:07:17.205 --> 01:07:21.209
So, um, to-to-to answer
your question, basically,

01:07:21.709 --> 01:07:24.712
uh, I'm equipped to,
to-to deal with it.

01:07:27.757 --> 01:07:29.842
To deal with anything, actually.

01:07:33.763 --> 01:07:35.723
Yeah, to deal with anything.

01:07:53.074 --> 01:07:56.702
After Tina died, I think he was
very happy when he met Eva.

01:07:58.788 --> 01:08:00.415
<i>They were a good team.</i>

01:08:00.415 --> 01:08:04.252
I mean, she's very proactive
and a businesswoman also.

01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:09.507
Adriana Berenson:
<i>Eva and Michael,
they were also a power couple.</i>

01:08:09.507 --> 01:08:12.593
She has--
also is very charismatic,

01:08:12.593 --> 01:08:14.679
<i>and they complemented
each other.</i>

01:08:15.722 --> 01:08:17.682
<i>And she became a magic carpet</i>

01:08:17.682 --> 01:08:19.267
<i>out of his depression,</i>

01:08:19.267 --> 01:08:23.229
and he did, once again,

01:08:23.229 --> 01:08:25.440
<i>become active in everything.</i>

01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:28.359
I'm excited to see
that one over there.

01:08:28.359 --> 01:08:30.778
Happy birthday!

01:08:30.778 --> 01:08:34.198
- You look great.
My son, Maximillian.

01:08:35.032 --> 01:08:37.952
- He's so tall!

01:08:38.453 --> 01:08:41.539
<i>So, that was a time</i>

01:08:41.539 --> 01:08:45.293
<i>where I'm in the mood
for never go hungry again.</i>

01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:49.797
So, I have to come back.
So, how do you come back?

01:08:49.797 --> 01:08:51.382
<i>I'm gonna build</i>

01:08:51.382 --> 01:08:53.968
<i>the greatest
21st-century house.</i>

01:08:53.968 --> 01:08:55.928
<i>Then, you have the fronting.</i>

01:08:55.928 --> 01:08:57.805
Brian Grazer:
<i>I went to his house
on Mapleton.</i>

01:08:57.805 --> 01:08:59.807
<i>He says, "Come to my house."</i>

01:08:59.807 --> 01:09:01.184
It blew my mind.

01:09:01.476 --> 01:09:04.020
<i>I said,
"Who is the architect?"</i>
<i>He said,</i>

01:09:04.020 --> 01:09:06.064
<i>"I'm the architect.
I built it."</i>

01:09:08.107 --> 01:09:10.651
Julian Schnabel:
<i>The first thing
you notice when you go in</i>

01:09:10.651 --> 01:09:14.363
<i>is to the right is this
gigantic Keith Haring painting</i>

01:09:14.363 --> 01:09:17.325
<i>that's gotta be 12 feet tall
that goes to the ceiling.</i>

01:09:20.161 --> 01:09:22.330
<i>And, uh, you go in further,</i>

01:09:22.330 --> 01:09:24.624
<i>and it's like
a giant open ballroom.</i>

01:09:24.624 --> 01:09:28.836
<i>There's spectacular paintings
on all the walls.</i>

01:09:29.670 --> 01:09:32.048
<i>I remember sitting
in the kitchen.</i>

01:09:32.048 --> 01:09:35.009
I noticed a little painting

01:09:35.009 --> 01:09:37.261
leaning against a wall.

01:09:37.261 --> 01:09:39.347
I asked Michael, "What's that?"

01:09:39.347 --> 01:09:40.807
<i>He perked up.</i>

01:09:40.807 --> 01:09:42.642
<i>"That's one of my paintings</i>

01:09:42.642 --> 01:09:46.938
<i>from back in the early '60s
in London."</i>

01:09:47.522 --> 01:09:52.026
<i>And that is how the whole saga
with Michael Chow</i>

01:09:52.026 --> 01:09:54.487
<i>as the reborn artist,</i>

01:09:54.487 --> 01:09:58.199
<i>or as he prefers
to call himself now, M,</i>

01:09:58.199 --> 01:10:00.535
<i>that's how it began.</i>

01:10:08.209 --> 01:10:11.713
<i>In Chinese culture...</i>

01:10:11.713 --> 01:10:14.507
<i>they have a convention
for the artists...</i>

01:10:14.507 --> 01:10:16.884
<i>in creating new name.</i>

01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:19.846
<i>So, I choose M.</i>

01:10:20.972 --> 01:10:22.432
<i>M is a neutral name.</i>

01:10:22.432 --> 01:10:23.975
<i>Is easy for the West,</i>

01:10:23.975 --> 01:10:26.519
<i>easy for the East.</i>

01:10:28.271 --> 01:10:29.564
<i>And also,</i>

01:10:29.564 --> 01:10:32.900
if I paint under
the name...

01:10:32.900 --> 01:10:34.610
Mr. Chow, it's ridiculous.

01:10:41.743 --> 01:10:45.371
<i>I think that Eva and Michael
had a difficult time,</i>

01:10:45.371 --> 01:10:49.917
and painting gave him
that outlet.

01:10:49.917 --> 01:10:52.378
<i>And when he started to do that,</i>

01:10:52.378 --> 01:10:55.923
<i>he kind of got rejuvenated,
and he, all of a sudden,</i>

01:10:55.923 --> 01:10:59.886
<i>was much more enthusiastic
about being alive.</i>

01:11:00.636 --> 01:11:04.265
Unfortunately,
I'm in the late part
of my third act.

01:11:04.766 --> 01:11:07.894
<i>My time is very precious
and very limited.</i>

01:11:08.478 --> 01:11:11.814
<i>And I must devote myself
to my painting.</i>

01:11:36.005 --> 01:11:40.134
<i>It was clear that he and Eva
were not in a good place</i>

01:11:40.134 --> 01:11:41.928
and hadn't been for
a very long time.

01:11:41.928 --> 01:11:44.639
Eva...

01:11:45.681 --> 01:11:49.352
So, I gotta go strip one by one.

01:11:51.979 --> 01:11:56.150
Simon De Pury:
<i>She is, uh, super strong,
uh, in character,</i>

01:11:56.150 --> 01:11:57.693
<i>like, like he is,</i>

01:11:57.693 --> 01:11:59.570
and, uh, you know,
they have been partners

01:11:59.570 --> 01:12:00.655
for many, many years,

01:12:00.655 --> 01:12:03.908
and has played
a big role in his life.

01:12:04.492 --> 01:12:07.161
<i>Of course, castle has problems.</i>

01:12:07.453 --> 01:12:10.456
Can be a prison.
Can be a prison.

01:12:10.456 --> 01:12:13.209
Uh-oh!
Never thought of that one.

01:12:14.001 --> 01:12:17.714
But, life says, "Okay, let's
change the script a little here.

01:12:17.714 --> 01:12:21.300
"Let, let's destroy the castle
in order to feel

01:12:21.300 --> 01:12:24.303
other magical stuff
waiting for you." You see?

01:12:24.303 --> 01:12:26.305
I said, "What is it?"

01:12:26.305 --> 01:12:29.308
"Not gonna tell you,
but it's coming."

01:12:33.771 --> 01:12:36.607
Jose Antonio Alonso Espinosa:
<i>While he was going
through the divorce with Eva,</i>

01:12:36.607 --> 01:12:39.402
<i>somebody said,
"Well, if this goes on,</i>

01:12:39.402 --> 01:12:41.821
<i>you both are gonna
lose everything."</i>

01:12:41.821 --> 01:12:43.573
And he told me,
"You know? I don't give a shit.

01:12:43.573 --> 01:12:45.032
"I could go back to the street.

01:12:45.032 --> 01:12:46.826
"I lived there before,
so I don't give a crap.

01:12:46.826 --> 01:12:49.412
If I lose everything,
I can live in the sidewalk."

01:12:51.456 --> 01:12:53.958
<i>After the high,
you go to the simplicity.</i>

01:12:53.958 --> 01:12:55.209
<i>You go to the low.</i>

01:12:55.209 --> 01:12:58.588
You go to, back to the,
uh, fundamental,

01:12:58.588 --> 01:13:02.341
which is one fork,
one frying pan, one bed.

01:13:02.341 --> 01:13:04.677
Zen.

01:13:05.928 --> 01:13:09.849
And find the universe in that
and start rebuild,

01:13:10.391 --> 01:13:11.517
go again.

01:13:11.517 --> 01:13:13.061
assistant camera:
Take one, mark.

01:13:15.354 --> 01:13:16.939
interviewer 3:
How did you guys meet?

01:13:16.939 --> 01:13:19.317
Uh, we met on an elevator.

01:13:19.317 --> 01:13:21.152
Yes. We met on an elevator

01:13:21.152 --> 01:13:24.572
on the way to a doctor's office.

01:13:24.864 --> 01:13:28.618
When I met Michael,
I was in graduate school.

01:13:28.618 --> 01:13:32.497
I was, uh, finishing
my graduate degree

01:13:32.497 --> 01:13:34.457
in social work, um...

01:13:34.916 --> 01:13:37.668
I don't know. He told me
he'd been gambling for 50 years.

01:13:37.668 --> 01:13:41.964
You know, so that's kind of
his drug of choice, so to speak.

01:13:42.799 --> 01:13:44.092
Um...

01:13:44.717 --> 01:13:47.970
And as we started talking,
he became really kind of,

01:13:47.970 --> 01:13:51.933
he just started to become aware
and would tell me about, um,

01:13:53.101 --> 01:13:57.063
about how he's used gambling
as sort of a,

01:13:57.438 --> 01:14:00.733
a way to numb pain.

01:14:00.733 --> 01:14:04.070
I played poker all my life.

01:14:04.070 --> 01:14:05.780
Recently, I quit.

01:14:07.532 --> 01:14:09.617
Means I'm getting better.
Why I'm getting better?

01:14:09.617 --> 01:14:11.244
Because I met Vanessa.

01:14:14.163 --> 01:14:16.833
Vanessa Chow:
<i>I think I was like 27
at the time.</i>

01:14:16.833 --> 01:14:18.710
<i>Our age difference
was something</i>

01:14:18.710 --> 01:14:20.670
<i>that we openly discussed.</i>

01:14:20.670 --> 01:14:23.381
You know, Michael had already
lived this kind of grand life,

01:14:23.381 --> 01:14:24.882
and he had adult children.

01:14:24.882 --> 01:14:27.301
I think some of them
are older than me. And so...

01:14:27.301 --> 01:14:29.637
And he was like,
"Will you marry me,

01:14:29.637 --> 01:14:31.848
and will you have,
and will you have my baby?"

01:14:31.848 --> 01:14:34.851
And I was like, "Oh, my gosh,
you're crazy, but yes. I will."

01:14:42.525 --> 01:14:44.318
Dada gonna put you down,

01:14:44.318 --> 01:14:46.654
and Dada gonna have some coffee!

01:14:46.654 --> 01:14:48.531
Ooh, yeah. Ooh...

01:14:48.531 --> 01:14:50.158
<i>I'm living in a movie
all the time.</i>

01:14:50.158 --> 01:14:53.161
<i>Instead of three-act movie,
I have five acts, right?</i>

01:14:53.161 --> 01:14:55.329
Here we go.

01:14:57.832 --> 01:15:01.127
<i>I find it very challenging,</i>

01:15:01.127 --> 01:15:04.130
<i>because, physically,
I have to be athlete</i>

01:15:04.130 --> 01:15:07.341
<i>to deal with my youngest son, Phoenix.</i>

01:15:07.341 --> 01:15:08.676
<i>He's 2 years old.</i>

01:15:08.676 --> 01:15:10.678
<i>He run around so fast</i>

01:15:11.512 --> 01:15:13.389
<i>so I have to keep up.</i>

01:15:15.850 --> 01:15:19.187
I wish I had that skill
when I was, uh, younger.

01:15:20.313 --> 01:15:22.815
Dada love you.
See, she smiles.

01:15:22.815 --> 01:15:26.277
<i>Michael insists on looking
after the babies at night.</i>

01:15:26.277 --> 01:15:28.029
Yes.

01:15:29.197 --> 01:15:30.865
<i>The kids sleeping and knowing</i>

01:15:30.865 --> 01:15:32.992
<i>that their dada is,
like, there,</i>

01:15:32.992 --> 01:15:35.620
he thinks is going
to make them strong

01:15:35.620 --> 01:15:37.705
and sort of get
their foundation right,

01:15:37.705 --> 01:15:39.916
knowing that their father's
always there

01:15:39.916 --> 01:15:41.626
while they're sleeping,
and so...

01:15:41.626 --> 01:15:42.877
He just thinks that's
really important

01:15:42.877 --> 01:15:44.420
for them to, to have that.

01:15:44.420 --> 01:15:47.382
- So this is Michael when
he was 6 months old.

01:15:47.382 --> 01:15:49.926
- Look at this little cutie.
Look like this one.
Exactly the same.

01:15:49.926 --> 01:15:52.095
Yeah. And there's Phoenix
when he's 6 months old.

01:15:52.095 --> 01:15:54.180
- They're, like, literally twins.

01:15:54.180 --> 01:15:56.891
Airmail, six cents.

01:15:57.392 --> 01:15:59.727
I wrote this when I was 13.

01:15:59.727 --> 01:16:01.229
Perfect Chinese,
perfect everything,

01:16:01.229 --> 01:16:02.897
- and now, I can't read it even.
Yep.

01:16:02.897 --> 01:16:05.149
- He can't read his writing now.

01:16:05.149 --> 01:16:08.236
<i>That moment when
I was 12 or 13 years old</i>

01:16:08.653 --> 01:16:11.322
<i>when that door shut,
my heart turned to stone.</i>

01:16:12.740 --> 01:16:15.201
<i>So, very fortunate.
She saved my life, you know?</i>

01:16:15.201 --> 01:16:16.327
<i>So, she saved my life.</i>

01:16:34.095 --> 01:16:35.263
Lights!

01:17:10.798 --> 01:17:12.842
- Yes.
- interviewer 2:
What did you see?

01:17:13.259 --> 01:17:16.345
Well, I didn't see much.
I see lot of, uh...

01:17:17.930 --> 01:17:19.182
mm...

01:17:20.516 --> 01:17:22.810
Chinese epic battle.

01:17:25.313 --> 01:17:27.190
Hm. That's what I saw.

01:17:27.190 --> 01:17:30.359
And I saw, uh...

01:17:30.359 --> 01:17:34.822
<i>I saw across the river a sage</i>

01:17:34.822 --> 01:17:38.451
<i>and that particular sage
is my father.</i>

01:17:38.451 --> 01:17:40.161
<i>I know it's my father.</i>

01:17:41.704 --> 01:17:44.373
My best dreams are...

01:17:45.416 --> 01:17:47.335
I can fly.

01:17:48.503 --> 01:17:52.006
<i>I fly into the sky
like Superman</i>

01:17:53.007 --> 01:17:55.176
<i>and I can fly everywhere.</i>

01:18:28.710 --> 01:18:32.255
<i>The first time that we went
to China as a family,</i>

01:18:32.255 --> 01:18:34.924
<i>and he was telling us
about his mom</i>

01:18:34.924 --> 01:18:37.885
<i>and talking about the last time
he saw his mom,</i>

01:18:37.885 --> 01:18:39.387
<i>I'd never seen him cry before,</i>

01:18:39.387 --> 01:18:42.223
and it had such an impact on me.

01:18:55.403 --> 01:18:59.323
We didn't get it.
We didn't say goodbye
to our father.

01:19:03.786 --> 01:19:05.121
<i>Yeah, I think his whole life</i>

01:19:05.121 --> 01:19:07.665
<i>is sort of a tribute
to his father.</i>

01:19:07.665 --> 01:19:08.833
<i>Especially, like,
he said that</i>

01:19:08.833 --> 01:19:11.210
<i>the last thing
his dad said to him was,</i>

01:19:11.961 --> 01:19:15.381
<i>"Wherever you go,
remember that you're Chinese."</i>

01:19:15.381 --> 01:19:19.886
And I think Michael
has really, like, lived that.

01:19:28.561 --> 01:19:30.688
<i>My father is</i>

01:19:30.688 --> 01:19:33.149
<i>the quintessential
Chinese man.</i>

01:19:34.442 --> 01:19:37.945
<i>And that's what my journey
is all about.</i>

01:19:39.864 --> 01:19:41.532
To fulfill

01:19:43.951 --> 01:19:47.830
my father's destiny.

01:19:49.624 --> 01:19:52.919
This is a portrait
of, of Vanessa,

01:19:54.295 --> 01:19:56.089
and, uh,

01:19:56.089 --> 01:19:59.967
sort of blonde
Marilyn Monroe-ish.

01:19:59.967 --> 01:20:02.178
So, this one, it's called

01:20:02.178 --> 01:20:05.306
"The Pink Drop Giant
Pink Waterfall Drop."

01:20:05.306 --> 01:20:09.310
Pulled away from the hole,
and then created this hole,

01:20:09.310 --> 01:20:11.896
and it's a drop hanging.
It's very romantic, right?

01:20:11.896 --> 01:20:15.024
And this thing keep on growing
due to gravity,

01:20:15.024 --> 01:20:17.610
getting longer and longer.

01:20:17.610 --> 01:20:20.321
His big handicap as an artist

01:20:20.321 --> 01:20:23.324
is that he's already
a star as Mr. Chow.

01:20:23.324 --> 01:20:26.160
He's a star as somebody
who's hugely successful

01:20:26.160 --> 01:20:27.912
in the restaurant business.

01:20:27.912 --> 01:20:29.705
He built an incredible brand

01:20:29.705 --> 01:20:31.040
in a different field.

01:20:31.040 --> 01:20:34.836
Gallerists who
know him very well,
they're afraid.

01:20:34.836 --> 01:20:37.672
They don't wanna show
Michael Chow

01:20:37.672 --> 01:20:39.507
<i>because they're afraid
people will say,</i>

01:20:39.507 --> 01:20:42.844
<i>"Oh, you know, you're showing
a restaurateur?"</i>

01:20:43.428 --> 01:20:46.889
<i>Art world
puts people in silos.</i>

01:20:48.015 --> 01:20:50.351
But yes, Michael has
this challenge now.

01:20:58.735 --> 01:21:02.029
Jacob Twyford:
<i>Before I'd met Michael,
I knew he was a restaurateur.</i>

01:21:02.029 --> 01:21:05.658
<i>So when he
walked in the gallery,
I knew who he was,</i>

01:21:05.658 --> 01:21:08.703
<i>and I think,
"Great! I'm gonna sell him
a Peter Blake."</i>

01:21:09.162 --> 01:21:10.913
<i>And, uh, in fact, he sold me</i>

01:21:10.913 --> 01:21:13.833
<i>his entire lifetime's
ambitions.</i>

01:21:13.833 --> 01:21:16.502
So, when somebody comes
to me and says, you know,

01:21:16.502 --> 01:21:19.380
"Oh, but he's just a wealthy man
who likes to paint."

01:21:19.380 --> 01:21:22.550
I say, "No. He was a poor man
who liked to paint.

01:21:22.550 --> 01:21:23.968
"He-- Then, he got wealthy,

01:21:23.968 --> 01:21:26.095
and now, he's back here,
and he's painting again."

01:21:26.095 --> 01:21:28.681
- I want the light to shine here.

01:21:30.767 --> 01:21:33.895
This one is upside down as well.
This is the middle panel.

01:21:33.895 --> 01:21:36.105
No, no, no! Don't cut it!
Please.

01:21:36.105 --> 01:21:38.107
- No, don't cut it yet.
- Why?

01:21:38.107 --> 01:21:40.818
Yeah, we, yeah,
we take this off, and later,

01:21:40.818 --> 01:21:43.362
we can put this fucker
back if you want.

01:21:43.362 --> 01:21:46.074
Sorry, I swearing
because I'm happy.

01:21:48.076 --> 01:21:50.912
Don't forget, I'm almost 85.

01:21:50.912 --> 01:21:53.372
No, leave it on. L-L-Let me--

01:21:53.372 --> 01:21:54.791
Don't touch it.

01:21:54.791 --> 01:21:56.834
I prefer to do it myself.
Thank you.

01:21:59.379 --> 01:22:02.090
<i>I think when M was 16, 17,</i>

01:22:02.090 --> 01:22:05.676
<i>Cork Street was the place
where he would go
to see other art,</i>

01:22:05.676 --> 01:22:07.136
<i>go to meet other artists.</i>

01:22:07.136 --> 01:22:09.472
<i>This is where
the conversation took place.</i>

01:22:12.350 --> 01:22:16.479
<i>In 1958, I'm, like, begging
for exhibition here.</i>

01:22:16.771 --> 01:22:20.066
<i>And since then, the rejection
in the art world.</i>

01:22:20.775 --> 01:22:24.529
<i>Finally,
this is very important
coming home for me.</i>

01:23:32.638 --> 01:23:34.348
It means so much
to us, you guys.

01:23:34.348 --> 01:23:37.602
Michael's been waiting for this,
like, his whole life, you know?

01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:41.481
Steve Coogan:
<i>I mean, you look
at his paintings,</i>

01:23:41.481 --> 01:23:43.608
in actual fact,
they reflect his personality,

01:23:43.608 --> 01:23:47.862
which is ambitious
and has a sense of scale.

01:23:49.864 --> 01:23:52.575
Kathryn Andrews:
<i>What surprises me
about these paintings,</i>

01:23:52.575 --> 01:23:55.119
actually, when you think
about M's trajectory,

01:23:55.119 --> 01:23:57.580
is how joyous
and free they are.

01:23:57.580 --> 01:24:00.917
<i>I mean, think about this
young boy coming to London,</i>

01:24:00.917 --> 01:24:03.002
<i>totally stripped
from his family.</i>

01:24:03.002 --> 01:24:05.588
<i>And yet, when I see
these paintings,</i>

01:24:05.588 --> 01:24:07.715
<i>they speak about turmoil,
they speak about tension,</i>

01:24:07.715 --> 01:24:10.343
<i>but they're also
very just joyous and free.</i>

01:24:12.553 --> 01:24:15.890
<i>I care more that
he's making the work.</i>

01:24:15.890 --> 01:24:17.892
<i>To me, is what's important.</i>

01:24:17.892 --> 01:24:21.354
That he has something that
he feels that he needs to say,

01:24:21.354 --> 01:24:24.816
and therefore, he is,
he's putting it out there.

01:24:28.277 --> 01:24:33.074
<i>Whether my present peer
would accept me or not,</i>

01:24:33.074 --> 01:24:36.035
<i>it's matter
because I have vanity,</i>

01:24:36.035 --> 01:24:39.956
<i>and I, I like audiences,
I like applauses.</i>

01:24:39.956 --> 01:24:41.290
By the way,
my father says,

01:24:41.290 --> 01:24:45.002
"Don't listen to the...
hand applauding.

01:24:45.002 --> 01:24:47.672
Listen to the heart applauding."
Okay?

01:24:47.672 --> 01:24:50.466
I'm not that level yet.
I'm working on it.

01:24:50.466 --> 01:24:53.594
I'm still
listening to the hand.
I prefer the hand.

01:25:05.606 --> 01:25:08.109
<i>What are things that
I've learned from my dad</i>

01:25:08.109 --> 01:25:11.446
<i>that have informed
what kind of person I am?</i>

01:25:12.572 --> 01:25:16.451
<i>The importance of art
and creativity</i>

01:25:16.451 --> 01:25:20.079
<i>is something that is
very important to him, and,</i>

01:25:20.079 --> 01:25:22.957
and that it's not trivial.
It's, um...

01:25:23.666 --> 01:25:26.461
It's actually one of the things
that makes us human.

01:25:43.394 --> 01:25:45.897
<i>Most important thing
about artists is their job</i>

01:25:45.897 --> 01:25:48.816
<i>to be true to their time,</i>

01:25:49.901 --> 01:25:52.570
<i>true to their dream,</i>

01:25:53.905 --> 01:25:55.990
<i>and, above all,</i>

01:25:55.990 --> 01:25:58.826
<i>true to themselves.</i>

01:25:58.826 --> 01:26:02.789
So, real version of me?
Look into my painting.

01:26:03.956 --> 01:26:05.958
And painting can never lie.

01:26:05.958 --> 01:26:08.920
Nowhere to go.
Nowhere to hide.

01:26:10.004 --> 01:26:11.798
We will find you.

01:26:30.983 --> 01:26:33.653
Alexa! Play Elvis!

01:26:34.195 --> 01:26:37.448
- Alexa.

01:26:38.908 --> 01:26:40.284
Alexa!

01:26:42.412 --> 01:26:43.955
Alexa!

01:26:44.997 --> 01:26:47.667
Alexa! Alexa!

01:26:48.876 --> 01:26:52.714
Alexa! Alexa!
