WEBVTT

00:03.704 --> 00:06.940
[theme music]

00:08.509 --> 00:10.578
OK, so we need
brushes, lacquer thinner,

00:10.611 --> 00:13.114
turpentine, polyurethane,
and paint Stripper.

00:13.147 --> 00:14.014
Anything else?

00:14.048 --> 00:15.349
Nope.

00:15.383 --> 00:17.585
Remember though, that stuff
needs a lot of ventilation.

00:17.618 --> 00:19.820
So take all the lids off
in the car on the way home.

00:26.160 --> 00:27.228
What?

00:27.261 --> 00:29.497
I'm sorry for staring
at you, Mrs. Conner,

00:29.530 --> 00:31.865
but there's just something
about a pregnant woman

00:31.899 --> 00:33.467
that's just so beautiful.

00:37.338 --> 00:38.839
Beautiful how?

00:38.872 --> 00:39.940
I don't know.

00:39.973 --> 00:41.309
Well, you used
the word beautiful.

00:41.342 --> 00:43.311
You must know what you mean.

00:43.344 --> 00:45.546
You're just
beautiful, that's all.

00:45.579 --> 00:46.647
Oh, really?

00:46.680 --> 00:48.916
Well, is it my swollen
ankles that you like

00:48.949 --> 00:51.752
or my varicose veins.

00:51.785 --> 00:56.224
Maybe they appeal to
your artist's eye, huh?

00:56.257 --> 00:59.227
Or maybe it's my haggard
face from lack of sleep.

00:59.260 --> 01:01.895
But I think the real
question here is, is

01:01.929 --> 01:06.167
beautiful strong enough a word?

01:06.200 --> 01:08.236
Thank you, Mr. Conner,
for telling me to say that.

01:13.141 --> 01:14.408
Beautiful how?

01:14.442 --> 01:16.009
Hi ya, DJ.

01:16.043 --> 01:18.712
Your old room is just
about ready to be painted.

01:18.746 --> 01:20.914
Becky and Darlene volunteered
to help, how about you?

01:20.948 --> 01:22.216
No way.

01:22.250 --> 01:24.652
I'm moving across the hall
and I'm never looking back.

01:24.685 --> 01:25.653
So why announce it?

01:25.686 --> 01:28.322
Nobody's going to notice.

01:28.356 --> 01:30.023
Well, at least tell
your sisters to hurry up

01:30.057 --> 01:30.891
with that drop cloth.

01:33.594 --> 01:36.197
It's just so
great, isn't it, Dan?

01:36.230 --> 01:39.900
Two girls all grown
up, volunteering to help

01:39.933 --> 01:41.602
paint their baby
sister's nursery.

01:41.635 --> 01:42.436
Oh.

01:45.739 --> 01:48.075
I remember that.

01:48.108 --> 01:52.045
Now the pregnancy hormones
get you all sentimental.

01:52.079 --> 01:52.980
Go to hell, Jackie.

01:53.013 --> 01:55.115
This ain't about you.

01:55.149 --> 01:57.618
Hey, honey, remember,
you like Jackie.

01:57.651 --> 01:59.587
Jackie good.

01:59.620 --> 02:03.023
Oh, the nursery's
really coming along.

02:03.056 --> 02:05.859
You gonna fix those dents in
the wall before you paint it?

02:05.893 --> 02:07.661
Oh, wow.

02:07.695 --> 02:09.497
You remember these, Rosie?

02:09.530 --> 02:11.299
I sure do.

02:11.332 --> 02:14.402
That's where Darlene banged
DJ's head in the wall

02:14.435 --> 02:18.071
every year to show
how tall he'd grown.

02:18.105 --> 02:19.507
You got to promise
me you are not

02:19.540 --> 02:21.008
going to paint over those, Dan.

02:21.041 --> 02:22.976
Oh, I have to honey.

02:23.010 --> 02:25.713
But remember, we'll
always have the x-rays.

02:25.746 --> 02:27.648
Hey, I got to get
going, but now I

02:27.681 --> 02:30.518
have officially returned all the
baby clothes that you lent me.

02:30.551 --> 02:31.952
Where's the rest of the stuff?

02:31.985 --> 02:33.821
What do you mean?

02:33.854 --> 02:37.591
Well, going alphabetically
after clothes comes crib.

02:37.625 --> 02:40.694
Roseanne, my little Andy
still slips in that crib.

02:40.728 --> 02:42.296
Well, let him hop
in bed with you.

02:42.330 --> 02:46.534
He's going to be in therapy for
the rest of his life anyway.

02:46.567 --> 02:48.669
Clint moves out.
My baby has no father.

02:48.702 --> 02:50.438
Now you want to
take away his bed?

02:50.471 --> 02:51.472
All right, fine, keep it.

02:51.505 --> 02:53.106
We'll buy another one.

02:53.140 --> 02:56.009
That thing was a
death trap anyway.

02:56.043 --> 02:57.177
Here, Dad.

02:57.211 --> 02:58.346
It was all I could find.

03:03.417 --> 03:07.855
Where in the
hell have you been?

03:07.888 --> 03:09.657
Don't yell at me, Mother.

03:09.690 --> 03:10.824
I was getting this.

03:10.858 --> 03:11.959
Well, it took you long enough.

03:11.992 --> 03:13.294
Seems like you've been
gone for three years.

03:16.497 --> 03:18.899
[theme music]

04:04.312 --> 04:06.280
What the hell is that?

04:06.314 --> 04:08.949
That is a jogging stroller.

04:08.982 --> 04:11.552
Yeah, well, unless the
jogger comes with it,

04:11.585 --> 04:13.654
I don't want nothing
to do with it.

04:13.687 --> 04:15.956
Oh, man, I wanted
one of these.

04:15.989 --> 04:17.458
See, a wiper warmer.

04:17.491 --> 04:18.459
See there?

04:18.492 --> 04:20.994
That keeps the little
baby wipes warm.

04:21.028 --> 04:24.398
What's a baby wipe?

04:24.432 --> 04:26.199
Here's the cribs.

04:26.233 --> 04:27.835
Hey, that one's pretty nice.

04:27.868 --> 04:29.102
Well, it ought to be.

04:29.136 --> 04:30.838
It's $499.

04:30.871 --> 04:34.975
God, for that money, I could
buy her a used Vega to sleep in.

04:35.008 --> 04:36.009
Look at this.

04:36.043 --> 04:37.678
This is 425.

04:37.711 --> 04:42.416
They're so fancy, you know,
the Hampton, the Walden,

04:42.450 --> 04:44.585
the Shenandoah.

04:44.618 --> 04:47.655
Well, find me one called,
I needed a cheap replacement

04:47.688 --> 04:50.424
because my sister stole mine.

04:50.458 --> 04:51.892
Maybe that would
be next to the one

04:51.925 --> 04:53.961
called the Indian Giver.

04:53.994 --> 04:55.463
Hi, hi, hi.

04:55.496 --> 04:56.730
Well, here we are.

04:56.764 --> 04:58.065
We're shopping,
we're having fun.

04:58.098 --> 05:01.602
Isn't this exciting?

05:01.635 --> 05:04.872
What can I help you with today?

05:04.905 --> 05:07.841
It seems as if I have
a baby stuck inside me.

05:07.875 --> 05:10.944
Can you help me with that?

05:10.978 --> 05:12.646
We're just looking, thanks.

05:12.680 --> 05:14.782
Although I'll take
a beer if you got one.

05:14.815 --> 05:16.350
Is this your first?

05:16.384 --> 05:17.317
No.

05:17.351 --> 05:19.953
I had a couple
before I left home.

05:19.987 --> 05:22.890
You're fun.

05:22.923 --> 05:24.625
Well, listen if
you need any help,

05:24.658 --> 05:26.894
or you want to register
for your baby shower--

05:26.927 --> 05:27.795
Oh, no, no.

05:27.828 --> 05:29.096
No baby showers.

05:29.129 --> 05:30.698
That's for women that are
happy they're having a baby.

05:30.731 --> 05:32.900
I'm only having this
baby to counterbalance

05:32.933 --> 05:35.536
the Mormon lady down the road.

05:35.569 --> 05:37.571
Besides, all you
really need is the crib.

05:37.605 --> 05:39.873
Yeah, but unfortunately,
none of our friends

05:39.907 --> 05:43.877
can waste $400 on anything
but lottery tickets.

05:43.911 --> 05:47.515
Maybe I'll check
back with you later.

05:47.548 --> 05:52.986
Although, I do have 40
friends who could each afford

05:53.020 --> 05:57.758
about a crappy $10 gift.

05:57.791 --> 06:01.194
How lenient is
your return policy?

06:01.228 --> 06:04.532
30 days for store credit.

06:04.565 --> 06:07.401
All right, this crib is mine.

06:07.435 --> 06:09.102
And I'm having that shower.

06:09.136 --> 06:11.605
And I'm inviting
every sucker I know.

06:11.639 --> 06:13.774
And I'm going to
oversell the popcorn so I

06:13.807 --> 06:17.310
can make extra money on drinks.

06:17.344 --> 06:18.211
Hey, yeah, OK.

06:18.245 --> 06:19.813
The name's Conner.

06:19.847 --> 06:21.482
So here's what I want.

06:21.515 --> 06:22.416
I'll take one of those.

06:30.390 --> 06:32.059
What are you so happy about?

06:32.092 --> 06:33.594
I thought high school
was going to be hard,

06:33.627 --> 06:34.895
but this is going to be great.

06:34.928 --> 06:35.796
Hey, look.

06:35.829 --> 06:36.664
They made a mistake.

06:36.697 --> 06:37.731
They put me in a dumb math.

06:40.734 --> 06:41.635
Oh please, DJ.

06:41.669 --> 06:43.170
You'll never make it past lunch.

06:43.203 --> 06:44.271
All the switchblades
in your back

06:44.304 --> 06:46.807
will keep setting off
the metal detectors.

06:46.840 --> 06:49.142
No way, nobody would do that.

06:49.176 --> 06:50.343
Yeah, you're right.

06:50.377 --> 06:52.580
They probably wouldn't
let you keep their knives.

06:52.613 --> 06:53.981
Where the hell have you been?

07:01.154 --> 07:04.291
Why does everyone
keep saying that to me?

07:04.324 --> 07:07.127
Hey, Becky, Darlene says on
my first day of high school,

07:07.160 --> 07:09.162
I'm going to get stabbed.

07:09.196 --> 07:11.331
Darlene, what are
you telling him?

07:11.364 --> 07:12.399
Yeah.

07:12.432 --> 07:13.801
No one's going to
want to come near him

07:13.834 --> 07:18.171
after they've pulled him naked
out of the lunchroom dumpster.

07:18.205 --> 07:19.473
I'm not going!

07:22.342 --> 07:24.678
Hey, sorry I got held up.

07:24.712 --> 07:25.879
How far do you
get on the nursery?

07:25.913 --> 07:27.180
Oh, I'm finished.

07:27.214 --> 07:28.248
Wow!

07:28.281 --> 07:29.850
You got the whole thing done?

07:29.883 --> 07:30.751
That's not what I said.

07:30.784 --> 07:31.952
I said I'm finished.

07:31.985 --> 07:34.087
Here, you're used to
laying on your back.

07:34.121 --> 07:36.624
Why don't you start
with the ceiling?

07:36.657 --> 07:38.926
Come on Darlene,
if we do it together,

07:38.959 --> 07:40.561
we can finish in a couple hours.

07:40.594 --> 07:42.563
You volunteered us
to do this, not me.

07:42.596 --> 07:44.498
I would have bailed
earlier, but I ran into Mom

07:44.532 --> 07:48.636
and she did that hormonal weepy
thing and told me she loved me.

07:48.669 --> 07:52.405
Haven't developed a
defense for that yet.

07:52.439 --> 07:53.874
I can't believe this.

07:53.907 --> 07:56.544
You're just going to quit?

07:56.577 --> 07:59.346
All right, I'll come help
you after I finish my book.

07:59.379 --> 08:01.549
Well, how far along are you?

08:01.582 --> 08:04.952
Call me Ishmael.

08:04.985 --> 08:07.454
Darlene, this isn't
about you for once.

08:07.487 --> 08:09.356
This is about mom's other baby.

08:09.389 --> 08:10.591
Look, I'm not
going to get involved

08:10.624 --> 08:11.825
in anything that's
going to encourage

08:11.859 --> 08:13.561
these people to procreate.

08:13.594 --> 08:16.129
That's why I'm so anti alcohol.

08:16.163 --> 08:17.965
Why can't you just
admit that you don't

08:17.998 --> 08:19.867
care about anyone but yourself?

08:19.900 --> 08:21.234
Don't start with me, Blondie.

08:21.268 --> 08:24.004
Oh, what's going on here?

08:24.037 --> 08:26.006
Just talking about
painting the nursery.

08:26.039 --> 08:27.875
Oh well, you don't have to
paint the nursery any more.

08:27.908 --> 08:28.942
You've been reassigned.

08:28.976 --> 08:31.111
You guys are throwing
me a baby shower.

08:31.144 --> 08:33.346
Baby shower?

08:33.380 --> 08:35.148
Do we have to?
No.

08:35.182 --> 08:36.416
You can throw me
a wedding shower

08:36.449 --> 08:37.718
or whatever you want
to call it as long

08:37.751 --> 08:41.454
as the gifts add up to $400.

08:41.488 --> 08:42.355
Here you go.

08:42.389 --> 08:45.525
Here's the guest list.

08:45.559 --> 08:48.829
Mother, there's like
1,000 people on this list.

08:48.862 --> 08:49.663
Ross Perot?

08:52.399 --> 08:53.500
Oprah Winfrey?

08:53.533 --> 08:57.470
Yeah, they don't know
that they don't know me.

08:57.504 --> 08:59.707
For my wedding, I got
a great bottle of wine

08:59.740 --> 09:02.242
from Spiro Agnew.

09:02.275 --> 09:03.510
But, Mom--

09:03.543 --> 09:04.678
No buts about it.

09:04.712 --> 09:06.446
You two are ingrates.

09:06.479 --> 09:09.817
Remember all the times
I made you pudding?

09:09.850 --> 09:10.884
OK, we'll do it.

09:10.918 --> 09:12.352
What?

09:12.385 --> 09:13.787
Sure, what the hell?

09:13.821 --> 09:14.622
Well?

09:17.490 --> 09:19.392
Fine, we'll
throw you a shower.

09:19.426 --> 09:24.231
Oh, that is just so sweet.

09:24.264 --> 09:28.836
My two daughters, working
together to give me

09:28.869 --> 09:30.437
have a baby shower.

09:30.470 --> 09:32.305
Oh, so great.

09:32.339 --> 09:34.842
I love you both so much.

09:34.875 --> 09:39.813
I'm going to have to make
you some pudding some day.

09:43.216 --> 09:44.952
What a basket case.

09:44.985 --> 09:49.522
When she hugged
me, I knew true fear.

09:49.556 --> 09:53.293
Well, I guess we should
decide who does what.

09:53.326 --> 09:57.530
How about you do the invitations
and I'll make the food.

09:57.564 --> 09:58.832
Whoa, Cowgirl.

09:58.866 --> 09:59.800
I've done my part.

09:59.833 --> 10:00.701
I volunteered us.

10:03.170 --> 10:04.204
Wait.

10:04.237 --> 10:05.973
You're not going to
stick me with this.

10:06.006 --> 10:08.676
Well, you stuck me with
painting the nursery.

10:08.709 --> 10:10.243
Becky, this isn't
about you for once.

10:10.277 --> 10:13.146
This is about Mom's other baby.

10:13.180 --> 10:15.683
Ooh, cuts both ways doesn't it?

10:15.716 --> 10:18.986
Hey, you're not getting
out of this, Darlene.

10:19.019 --> 10:21.054
Why do you have to be so lazy?

10:21.088 --> 10:22.790
You know that's
just like you, Becky

10:22.823 --> 10:25.225
assuming that this is the
only shower I have to work on.

10:39.606 --> 10:40.874
Wow!

10:40.908 --> 10:41.775
Nice job, David.

10:41.809 --> 10:43.176
.

10:43.210 --> 10:45.445
Thanks Hey, I know this guy's
shower was Mrs. Conner's idea.

10:45.478 --> 10:46.814
But I think it's great.

10:46.847 --> 10:48.682
I mean why should women
get to have all the fun?

10:48.716 --> 10:50.617
Men like babies.
- We're not animals.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.786
Yeah.

10:52.820 --> 10:54.587
Now, I called all the
guys' wives and got

10:54.621 --> 10:56.156
all their baby pictures.

10:56.189 --> 10:58.158
See I thought it would be fun
if we tried to match the guy's

10:58.191 --> 10:59.626
pictures to their timecards.

10:59.659 --> 11:00.427
Isn't that fun?

11:04.664 --> 11:09.069
You don't hang out with a
lot of mechanics do you, David?

11:09.102 --> 11:10.738
Hey guys, I'm not
quite finished yet.

11:10.771 --> 11:13.340
I still have pizza rolls
in the toaster over.

11:13.373 --> 11:15.342
No, you don't.

11:15.375 --> 11:16.810
Congratulations, Dan.

11:16.844 --> 11:18.145
Yeah, we all chipped
in and got you $45.

11:23.183 --> 11:24.584
Thanks, guys.

11:24.617 --> 11:26.486
Well, better get
back to work, huh?

11:26.519 --> 11:28.088
Yeah, they don't pay us
to stand around, right?

11:50.343 --> 11:52.145
Hey, Hey, we're
a present short.

11:52.179 --> 11:55.015
You pull back on
those hors d'oeuvres.

11:55.048 --> 11:57.885
Oh, look at this place.

11:57.918 --> 12:00.153
Oh, Becky and Darlene
did a great job.

12:00.187 --> 12:01.654
Yeah, didn't they?

12:01.688 --> 12:05.525
They got food and places to sit,
although not too many places

12:05.558 --> 12:08.028
to sit so people won't linger.

12:08.061 --> 12:10.130
Hello, Jackie.

12:10.163 --> 12:14.902
That's my other daughter,
the one I told you about.

12:14.935 --> 12:17.237
Who are these women
and why are they here?

12:17.270 --> 12:19.272
Oh, they're Mom's friends,
and the great thing

12:19.306 --> 12:21.241
is that most of them
are senile, so we can

12:21.274 --> 12:23.877
hit them up for presents twice.

12:23.911 --> 12:26.713
Roseanne, you asked me
to invite all my friends.

12:26.746 --> 12:29.749
And so far, you haven't
even said one word to them.

12:29.783 --> 12:32.452
Well, can I pick the word?

12:32.485 --> 12:33.854
Roseanne.

12:33.887 --> 12:36.523
OK.

12:36.556 --> 12:39.392
Hi.

12:39.426 --> 12:40.227
Sorry about your husband.

12:43.063 --> 12:43.864
Thank you.

12:46.533 --> 12:48.435
- What happened to her husband?
- I don't know.

12:48.468 --> 12:49.402
I'm just playing the odds.

12:52.172 --> 12:54.674
You know, I could use
some help out there.

12:54.707 --> 12:56.143
Yeah, I've been
watching and you could.

12:59.579 --> 13:01.148
I can't believe you, Darlene.

13:01.181 --> 13:03.450
I've had to do
everything myself.

13:03.483 --> 13:05.585
Well you were the one that
wanted all this fancy stuff.

13:05.618 --> 13:07.020
If it was up to me,
I'd just put out a 50

13:07.054 --> 13:08.588
pound bag of old people chow.

13:11.491 --> 13:13.726
OK, Darlene, you got
your revenge for painting

13:13.760 --> 13:15.128
the stupid nursery.

13:15.162 --> 13:17.397
Now the least you could do is
take these stuffed mushrooms

13:17.430 --> 13:18.631
out there.

13:18.665 --> 13:22.903
Isn't it enough that I
pretended to wash them?

13:22.936 --> 13:25.072
Hey, come on, we
need to get to the part

13:25.105 --> 13:26.639
where I open up the
old lady's gifts.

13:26.673 --> 13:28.208
One of them could die
and then the present

13:28.241 --> 13:31.411
would be wrapped up in probate.

13:31.444 --> 13:33.313
What do you got there?

13:33.346 --> 13:35.015
Stuffed mushrooms.

13:35.048 --> 13:37.584
Oh, well, they
look pretty good.

13:37.617 --> 13:38.585
Well, thanks.

13:38.618 --> 13:40.888
I made the mushrooms.

13:40.921 --> 13:42.789
There's no I in team, Becky.

13:46.359 --> 13:47.995
You know, I just want to
say something to you guys.

13:48.028 --> 13:49.997
I know that you've got
roped into doing this.

13:50.030 --> 13:51.364
But I want to show
how happy it makes me

13:51.398 --> 13:52.765
that you really pulled
together and pulled

13:52.799 --> 13:54.467
this whole thing off.

13:54.501 --> 13:55.768
It's so great how
you guys have turned

13:55.802 --> 13:57.704
into such really cool adults.

13:57.737 --> 14:01.474
And that makes me feel like I
could really raise another one.

14:01.508 --> 14:03.476
It was no problem, Mom.

14:03.510 --> 14:06.579
Yeah, it was our pleasure.

14:06.613 --> 14:09.182
Hey you guys, try my
special stuffed mushrooms.

14:17.857 --> 14:19.526
What's with the fruit.

14:19.559 --> 14:22.829
Making a fruit punch.

14:22.862 --> 14:24.831
Well, I've always found the
best way to make fruit punch

14:24.864 --> 14:27.968
is to put in a
carton of fruit punch

14:28.001 --> 14:32.005
and add another
carton of fruit punch.

14:32.039 --> 14:34.107
Mother, it's better this way.

14:34.141 --> 14:38.511
OK, but I'd rather
have it fast than good.

14:38.545 --> 14:41.448
Last call.

14:41.481 --> 14:42.916
Good, you're here.

14:42.950 --> 14:43.783
OK, girls.

14:46.553 --> 14:48.255
Now, I've got buttons.

14:48.288 --> 14:49.656
I've got string.

14:49.689 --> 14:52.825
I've got pipe cleaners and yarn.

14:52.859 --> 14:56.363
It's time to play
make a potato baby.

15:00.567 --> 15:03.503
Present time!

15:03.536 --> 15:04.504
Here you go, Roseanne.

15:04.537 --> 15:05.805
Hope you like these.

15:05.838 --> 15:06.839
Gee, thanks, Crystal.

15:06.873 --> 15:07.740
Oh.

15:07.774 --> 15:10.410
That's beautiful.

15:10.443 --> 15:11.844
Hey, that looks like
it came from a pretty

15:11.878 --> 15:13.146
expensive boutique.

15:13.180 --> 15:14.047
Oh no, ma'am.

15:14.081 --> 15:15.915
I made it myself.

15:15.949 --> 15:18.218
Oh.

15:18.251 --> 15:19.953
Here, Roseanne.

15:19.987 --> 15:21.754
Because I love
you and everything

15:21.788 --> 15:22.655
that comes out of you.

15:25.592 --> 15:26.859
What is it?

15:26.893 --> 15:29.296
It's a gift certificate to
have your baby zodiac chart

15:29.329 --> 15:31.364
on after she's born.

15:31.398 --> 15:33.500
Hey, telling one of my kids
what their future is going

15:33.533 --> 15:36.403
to be is no gift, believe me.

15:36.436 --> 15:39.406
Darlene, these stuffed
mushrooms are great.

15:39.439 --> 15:41.174
Thanks, I chewed up
the croutons myself.

15:44.611 --> 15:45.812
Here you are dear.

15:45.845 --> 15:48.081
My children are all
doing very well.

15:48.115 --> 15:50.383
And since Marvin passed
on, I don't really have

15:50.417 --> 15:51.484
anything to do with my money.

15:51.518 --> 15:52.585
So.

15:52.619 --> 15:56.456
Well, you certainly
came to the right place.

15:56.489 --> 16:00.793
Oh, in honor of
your baby, a tree

16:00.827 --> 16:02.095
has been planted in Israel.

16:06.266 --> 16:07.967
There you are, Beck.

16:08.001 --> 16:10.203
The world's last surviving
Confederate widow

16:10.237 --> 16:12.639
wants another drink.

16:12.672 --> 16:13.473
Darlene.

16:16.643 --> 16:17.644
Don't get up, Roseanne.

16:17.677 --> 16:18.778
I know the drill.

16:18.811 --> 16:20.447
Here's the gift.
Here's the receipt.

16:20.480 --> 16:21.481
I'll just put them in the car.

16:29.889 --> 16:32.759
Hey, let's play
a new game now, OK?

16:32.792 --> 16:34.427
It's called
unwrapping your gift.

16:34.461 --> 16:36.129
Everybody get the gift
that they brought me

16:36.163 --> 16:37.897
and unwrap it and
make two piles.

16:37.930 --> 16:40.500
This pile here, put
the stores where you

16:40.533 --> 16:42.269
bought it closest to my house.

16:42.302 --> 16:45.938
And the ones furthest
away, put over there.

16:45.972 --> 16:49.409
Well, look at them go.

16:49.442 --> 16:51.544
Hey, Becky we're all
done with the mushrooms.

16:51.578 --> 16:54.447
Stir frying up
them potato babies.

16:54.481 --> 16:56.416
She's not in the kitchen.

16:56.449 --> 16:58.785
She and Darlene went
upstairs a minute ago.

16:58.818 --> 17:00.487
Oh, man.

17:00.520 --> 17:01.854
I got to go up there
and break them up.

17:01.888 --> 17:03.223
Break them up why?

17:03.256 --> 17:04.157
They're getting along great.

17:04.191 --> 17:05.058
No they're not.

17:05.092 --> 17:06.226
They've been fighting all week.

17:06.259 --> 17:07.594
It's been nothing
but trouble ever

17:07.627 --> 17:12.865
since Becky dipped her chocolate
in Darlene's peanut butter.

17:12.899 --> 17:13.766
Need some help?

17:13.800 --> 17:16.569
No, I can get up.

17:16.603 --> 17:17.404
DJ!

17:27.780 --> 17:29.549
Get back downstairs, Darlene.

17:29.582 --> 17:31.184
Get out of my life, Becky.

17:31.218 --> 17:32.585
I'm not asking for much.

17:32.619 --> 17:36.756
It's not like I'm asking you to
shave your pits or something.

17:36.789 --> 17:38.158
You're just mad
because your body hasn't

17:38.191 --> 17:41.294
grown into your butt yet.

17:41.328 --> 17:43.396
Hey, I'm sick of your crap.

17:43.430 --> 17:46.032
You get downstairs
and do something.

17:46.065 --> 17:48.201
No, you're the one that wants
to be the perfect daughter,

17:48.235 --> 17:51.138
so you go downstairs and serve
mushrooms and paint the nursery

17:51.171 --> 17:52.505
and afterwards,
you can entertain

17:52.539 --> 17:53.773
the queen with riddles.

17:53.806 --> 17:56.943
Hey, I'm not trying to be
the perfect daughter, OK?

17:56.976 --> 17:59.712
I'm trying to be a
decent human being.

17:59.746 --> 18:02.649
Oh, bull, you are
always kissing Mom's ass.

18:02.682 --> 18:03.883
You get down there now!

18:03.916 --> 18:04.784
No!

18:04.817 --> 18:05.818
I said, go!

18:05.852 --> 18:07.720
Stop it, Becky!

18:07.754 --> 18:09.189
Stop it!
- Ow!

18:09.222 --> 18:10.190
Get off me!

18:10.223 --> 18:11.658
Hey, hey, hey!

18:11.691 --> 18:13.160
Knock it off.

18:13.193 --> 18:17.597
If you guys can't do your braids
nicely, then don't them at all.

18:17.630 --> 18:19.799
- She started it.
- Bull.

18:19.832 --> 18:21.468
OK, well enough is enough.

18:21.501 --> 18:23.303
You're over there and you're
over there and both of you

18:23.336 --> 18:25.172
shut the hell up.

18:25.205 --> 18:26.539
What's gotten into you guys?

18:26.573 --> 18:28.875
I can't believe you're back
into the whole fighting thing.

18:28.908 --> 18:32.779
If you don't stop, I'm wow.

18:32.812 --> 18:34.247
Wow.

18:34.281 --> 18:36.048
Deja vu.

18:36.082 --> 18:36.949
What?

18:36.983 --> 18:38.585
This, all this.

18:38.618 --> 18:40.320
You guys fighting again.

18:40.353 --> 18:41.221
You on that bed.

18:41.254 --> 18:42.289
You on that bed.

18:42.322 --> 18:44.957
Both of you wanting
to kill each other.

18:44.991 --> 18:47.594
It's kinda nice, you know?

18:47.627 --> 18:48.828
It is?

18:48.861 --> 18:51.798
Yeah, I kinda miss it.

18:51.831 --> 18:52.865
I miss my girls.

18:55.602 --> 18:57.704
But dammit, I can't
do this anymore.

18:57.737 --> 19:01.174
I have a child inside me,
who really is a child.

19:01.208 --> 19:04.511
You guys can't keep fighting
like you're 12 years old.

19:04.544 --> 19:06.579
This wasn't a
kid fight, Mother.

19:06.613 --> 19:09.982
This was an adult fight.

19:10.016 --> 19:11.984
Oh, really?

19:12.018 --> 19:13.486
DJ.

19:13.520 --> 19:14.654
What are you calling him for?

19:14.687 --> 19:15.888
You'll see.

19:15.922 --> 19:17.424
Hey, I didn't
push that old lady.

19:17.457 --> 19:20.527
She just fell.

19:20.560 --> 19:22.895
Well, this is nothing
to do with that.

19:22.929 --> 19:24.931
This is Darlene and
Becky fighting again.

19:24.964 --> 19:27.234
Do you remember the stuff
I used to say to them?

19:27.267 --> 19:28.134
Yeah.

19:28.167 --> 19:29.869
Well, tell them.

19:29.902 --> 19:33.072
Darlene, stop acting like
such a smart mouth little brat.

19:33.105 --> 19:35.275
And Becky, stop
acting like a martyr.

19:35.308 --> 19:37.477
If you two can't get along,
I'll lock you in your room

19:37.510 --> 19:38.878
until you do.

19:38.911 --> 19:41.080
Now I don't want to hear another
peep out of either one of you

19:41.113 --> 19:42.148
during the Love Boat.

19:45.418 --> 19:47.019
Well done, son.

19:47.053 --> 19:47.920
Thanks.

19:47.954 --> 19:48.755
Could I have a car?

19:51.324 --> 19:53.693
You guys know that I'm
always going to be your mom.

19:53.726 --> 19:55.728
But now I'm only going
to do that if you have

19:55.762 --> 19:57.830
19 and 21-year-old problems.

19:57.864 --> 20:00.400
If you're going to go pulling
all the little girl crap,

20:00.433 --> 20:01.568
then you can just go to DJ.

20:05.605 --> 20:07.307
Hey, what are you doing here?

20:07.340 --> 20:10.310
I decided to come home
early and roll the drunks.

20:10.343 --> 20:12.078
Jackie told me Becky and
Darlene were fighting.

20:12.111 --> 20:13.680
Yeah, well, it's no big deal.

20:13.713 --> 20:15.181
I just put DJ on it.

20:15.214 --> 20:16.649
Let's go count up the loot.

20:20.553 --> 20:21.621
DJ: All right you heard her.

20:21.654 --> 20:23.490
I'm the boss now.

20:23.523 --> 20:24.957
Hey!

20:24.991 --> 20:26.859
[crash]

20:34.767 --> 20:38.004
Oh, look, Dan, DJ has
gotten so much taller.

20:48.581 --> 20:55.154
(SINGING) Meet Lecy, the one
you used to see from '88 to '93.

20:55.187 --> 20:57.290
But Sarah came
and took her place

20:57.324 --> 20:59.025
because she had a similar face.

20:59.058 --> 21:00.960
That's life on TV.

21:00.993 --> 21:07.867
But they're Beckies, nearly
identical Beckies all the way,

21:07.900 --> 21:13.606
one pair of matching actors,
but only one part to play.

21:13.640 --> 21:16.776
Where Sarah loved
that dopey Mark,

21:16.809 --> 21:20.380
and wound up in a trailer
park, our Lecy shout, how lazy,

21:20.413 --> 21:21.448
school.

21:21.481 --> 21:22.949
She wants a house
that's not on wheels.

21:22.982 --> 21:24.984
What a crazy pair.

21:25.017 --> 21:29.456
Still they're Beckies,
nearly identical Beckies

21:29.489 --> 21:32.825
and you'll find,
they walk alike.

21:32.859 --> 21:33.726
They talk alike.

21:33.760 --> 21:35.595
Abruptly leave the show alike.

21:35.628 --> 21:42.635
You could lose your mind, when
Beckies ain't two of a kind.
