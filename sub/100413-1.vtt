01:21.584 --> 01:25.584
11, 12, 13, 14,

01:25.751 --> 01:28.709
15, 16, 17…

02:41.167 --> 02:44.626
TWO OF US

04:53.959 --> 04:55.876
Let's see this on you.

05:00.459 --> 05:02.959
- You think that's for me?
- For sure.

05:03.959 --> 05:05.542
Try it on, trust me.

05:06.876 --> 05:09.251
- All right.
- I was thinking…

05:09.417 --> 05:13.834
We could rent a place
in central Rome by the Tiber.

05:14.001 --> 05:15.501
The Tiber, yes.

05:16.209 --> 05:18.626
But it's way beyond our budget.

05:19.042 --> 05:20.292
Really? You think?

05:21.126 --> 05:22.251
You'll see.

05:22.792 --> 05:25.334
We'll find a beautiful apartment.

05:25.501 --> 05:27.251
With a big terrace.

05:27.417 --> 05:30.834
With the new friends we'll make,
we can be who we want.

05:31.334 --> 05:34.167
I'll say I'm a former
international swimmer,

05:34.334 --> 05:36.667
a gold medal winner at the Olympics.

05:41.042 --> 05:42.042
Mom?

05:48.251 --> 05:49.584
Ok? Not too hot?

05:49.751 --> 05:51.167
No, just fine.

05:54.959 --> 05:58.167
I tried to reach your brother
on the phone.

06:02.292 --> 06:03.709
You know what he's like.

06:03.876 --> 06:05.709
He could answer when I call.

06:06.292 --> 06:08.626
Mom, stop constantly chasing after him.

06:08.792 --> 06:10.126
He's not a kid anymore.

06:11.667 --> 06:14.417
- Don't be so hard on him.
- Hard?

06:15.584 --> 06:16.542
Shit.

06:17.001 --> 06:18.667
What's wrong?

06:19.001 --> 06:19.834
Nothing.

06:20.584 --> 06:22.251
- Tell me what's wrong.
- Nothing.

06:22.417 --> 06:25.584
Whatever I say, you'll take his side.
As always.

06:27.209 --> 06:29.917
Untrue.
You're talking nonsense.

06:30.501 --> 06:33.876
So when Fred accuses you
of cheating on dad,

06:34.209 --> 06:35.667
why sit and take it?

06:38.542 --> 06:40.167
I don't know how you do it.

06:42.584 --> 06:44.042
It's pointless discussing it.

06:49.626 --> 06:50.709
Yes, you're right.

08:44.251 --> 08:45.334
Nina…

08:46.376 --> 08:47.501
It's time.

08:51.334 --> 08:52.334
Coming?

09:14.709 --> 09:16.126
Yes, Mr. Brémont.

09:16.292 --> 09:18.667
Come on up, top floor.

09:19.292 --> 09:20.376
See you in a moment.

09:31.626 --> 09:34.167
- Some shots of the living room?
- Of course.

09:34.876 --> 09:36.376
Take your time.

09:36.542 --> 09:37.667
Hold on…

09:39.834 --> 09:41.334
And one here.

09:42.626 --> 09:43.626
Excuse me.

09:50.459 --> 09:51.917
Morning.

09:52.751 --> 09:55.709
- I do hope I'm not interrupting.
- Not at all.

09:56.626 --> 09:58.417
- Do come in.
- Thank you.

10:03.417 --> 10:06.334
Mr. Brémont came to see my apartment.

10:08.876 --> 10:12.042
- Pleased to meet you.
- Mrs. Dorn lives opposite.

10:12.209 --> 10:14.876
An identical apartment to Mrs. Girard's.

10:15.042 --> 10:17.792
I'd like to know your expert opinion.

10:18.209 --> 10:21.501
Spacious rooms, well laid out.

10:21.667 --> 10:24.251
- Impeccable.
- Very quiet, too.

10:24.959 --> 10:28.751
- If you want me to visit, just say so.
- You have all you need?

10:28.917 --> 10:31.792
- Yes, thank you, Mrs. Girard.
- Excellent.

10:33.542 --> 10:35.751
- A pleasure meeting you.
- It's mutual.

10:35.917 --> 10:39.042
- Don't forget the disclosure form.
- Of course.

10:39.209 --> 10:41.792
- Before it goes on the market.
- I'll do it tomorrow.

10:41.959 --> 10:45.417
Good. I'll call you this week
to set up an appointment.

10:45.584 --> 10:46.959
Absolutely. Perfect.

10:47.126 --> 10:48.834
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Mr. Brémont.

10:54.959 --> 10:55.917
Well?

10:56.084 --> 10:59.209
You couldn't keep your nose out,
could you?

10:59.376 --> 11:00.834
How much did he say?

11:01.001 --> 11:02.459
250,000.

11:03.334 --> 11:04.751
250,000?

11:24.042 --> 11:25.792
Look inside the envelope.

11:31.834 --> 11:32.959
Rome.

11:36.334 --> 11:38.209
My apartment isn't for sale yet.

11:38.542 --> 11:40.376
Yes, I know, but I thought

11:40.542 --> 11:43.251
we could start looking for our new home.

11:43.542 --> 11:46.084
We said no unnecessary spending

11:46.251 --> 11:48.292
until we find a buyer.

11:48.917 --> 11:50.251
Don't worry.

11:51.334 --> 11:52.667
I've thought of everything.

11:58.709 --> 11:59.709
What?

12:01.792 --> 12:02.751
Mado?

12:04.167 --> 12:05.167
Changed your mind?

12:07.459 --> 12:09.834
I said I'd tell them tomorrow.

12:14.709 --> 12:16.251
Tell them what?

12:17.292 --> 12:18.709
What we agreed.

12:19.626 --> 12:21.501
That I'm selling the apartment.

12:21.667 --> 12:23.084
And moving to Rome.

12:58.917 --> 13:00.376
Happy birthday!

13:00.542 --> 13:02.334
Thank you, sweetie.

13:02.501 --> 13:03.876
Théo, a kiss for Granny.

13:04.042 --> 13:05.751
Happy birthday, mom!

13:06.417 --> 13:07.417
For you.

13:07.584 --> 13:09.959
- That's very kind.
- It smells great.

13:10.126 --> 13:12.042
- Hi, mom.
- Hello, Frédéric.

13:15.167 --> 13:18.042
- Karine isn't with you?
- She had work to do.

13:18.209 --> 13:20.501
Théo, a kiss for Granny, I said.

13:29.542 --> 13:30.584
Not that again.

13:30.751 --> 13:32.376
Grow up, dammit.

13:32.542 --> 13:34.167
- You ok?
- Yes.

13:34.584 --> 13:36.584
- And you?
- Yeah, I'm ok.

13:37.667 --> 13:39.084
A bit tired but…

13:39.251 --> 13:41.167
Really? You're tired?

13:41.917 --> 13:43.751
- Gosh.
- It's hard at school.

13:46.334 --> 13:47.834
That's how it goes.

13:48.001 --> 13:50.876
You're going to eat
something you like, I'm sure.

13:51.042 --> 13:52.084
Maybe.

13:56.167 --> 13:57.751
But you're ok?

13:57.917 --> 13:58.917
Yes.

14:01.376 --> 14:03.126
I'm fine. What's that?

14:15.876 --> 14:18.667
Happy birthday, our beloved mommy.

14:18.834 --> 14:20.209
That's so sweet.

14:24.917 --> 14:27.209
- Thanks, kitten.
- Happy birthday.

14:29.042 --> 14:30.126
Blow them out?

14:30.292 --> 14:32.251
Yes, I'll blow them out.

14:43.376 --> 14:45.834
I'm really pleased you're here today.

14:46.209 --> 14:48.667
We're pleased to be here too, mom.

14:49.084 --> 14:51.667
No, I'm really pleased you could make it,

14:52.042 --> 14:54.751
and that you're both here with me today.

14:55.959 --> 14:57.667
Just a drop for me.

14:59.126 --> 15:02.001
- You see…
- Come to the table, sweetie.

15:06.667 --> 15:08.292
I wanted to tell you…

15:13.709 --> 15:16.834
something that's very important for me.

15:32.126 --> 15:33.917
I wanted to say I love you.

15:37.001 --> 15:38.959
I'm proud of all three of you.

15:41.001 --> 15:44.542
I'm really proud
to have all three of you here with me.

15:47.417 --> 15:48.501
Cheers.

15:51.084 --> 15:52.001
Cheers, mom.

15:56.584 --> 15:58.334
Théo, come to the table, I said.

15:59.917 --> 16:01.292
Don't play with that.

16:04.542 --> 16:05.792
Don't, dammit!

16:06.084 --> 16:08.126
What's with talking like that?

16:08.292 --> 16:10.709
It really doesn't matter, Frédéric.

16:10.876 --> 16:12.917
For you.
That clock matters to me.

16:13.542 --> 16:15.001
Take it if you want.

16:15.167 --> 16:18.001
Are you kidding?
Don't give him dad's clock.

16:18.167 --> 16:19.376
You'd like it, too?

16:19.542 --> 16:22.334
That's irrelevant.
He shouldn't help himself.

16:23.001 --> 16:25.584
I really don't care about the clock.

16:26.917 --> 16:28.459
Or anything else of dad's.

16:29.876 --> 16:31.709
You couldn't wait for him to croak.

16:33.001 --> 16:35.251
Fred, cut the crap or get out.

16:57.042 --> 16:58.751
Mom, don't think about it.

16:58.917 --> 17:01.001
I'll talk to Fred. Don't think about it.

17:06.667 --> 17:08.042
Evening, Mrs. Dorn.

17:09.626 --> 17:10.626
After you.

17:10.792 --> 17:12.209
Go ahead. I can wait.

17:12.376 --> 17:14.126
- You're sure?
- Yes.

17:14.292 --> 17:15.834
Or I'll stink you out.

17:16.417 --> 17:17.334
Thanks.

17:17.667 --> 17:19.334
Mom, Thursday at the salon.

17:19.917 --> 17:22.084
- Goodbye, Mrs. Dorn.
- Goodbye.

17:27.292 --> 17:28.292
Well?

17:31.834 --> 17:33.001
They agreed.

17:38.001 --> 17:39.501
I knew you could do it.

17:41.126 --> 17:42.376
I knew it.

18:09.917 --> 18:10.959
Nina?

18:11.209 --> 18:12.376
In here.

18:23.917 --> 18:25.292
What's all that money?

18:25.834 --> 18:27.542
Money for our trip.

18:29.209 --> 18:30.626
Where did you get it?

18:31.251 --> 18:32.667
I sold the clock.

18:32.834 --> 18:34.001
Which clock?

18:34.376 --> 18:36.459
The ugly one on the dresser.

18:41.001 --> 18:42.959
Can you answer that, sweetie?

18:50.959 --> 18:52.209
She's busy.

18:53.001 --> 18:54.167
Who is it?

18:54.542 --> 18:55.917
Who's calling, please?

18:57.834 --> 18:58.876
Mr. Brémont.

19:03.251 --> 19:05.042
Yes, hello, Mr. Brémont.

19:06.709 --> 19:08.542
No, I haven't had time.

19:09.209 --> 19:11.042
Yes, I know…

19:11.209 --> 19:13.167
It's a bit tricky right now.

19:14.751 --> 19:17.501
I need some time before I decide.

19:18.626 --> 19:20.459
I don't know what to say.

19:20.626 --> 19:22.542
I'm not sure I'm interested.

19:35.376 --> 19:36.751
Granny!

19:36.917 --> 19:37.917
What?

19:38.542 --> 19:42.334
The ball fell in the water.
Can you help me, please?

20:42.209 --> 20:43.917
I'll be outside. Smoking.

21:00.417 --> 21:01.626
Anyone here?

21:41.126 --> 21:42.251
Hello, Mr. Brémont.

21:43.584 --> 21:44.584
So…

21:44.876 --> 21:46.417
It turns out you're…

21:46.584 --> 21:48.292
not selling the apartment.

21:48.792 --> 21:50.834
Mr. Brémont tells me

21:51.001 --> 21:53.001
you're no longer interested.

21:53.167 --> 21:55.834
Isn't that what she said?
She's not interested.

21:56.376 --> 21:57.334
Yes but…

21:58.876 --> 22:00.251
You didn't tell your children.

22:00.542 --> 22:02.626
You didn't dare? Right?

22:02.959 --> 22:05.001
It's my son, Frédéric.

22:05.459 --> 22:06.876
I'm nobody's fool.

22:07.042 --> 22:09.084
I tried telling him.

22:10.042 --> 22:11.917
Always the same old excuse.

22:12.251 --> 22:15.126
- Always the same old excuse!
- I told you, I tried.

22:15.292 --> 22:17.167
Stop! Stop!

22:19.167 --> 22:20.167
Nina…

22:25.792 --> 22:27.709
Do you have a problem

22:27.876 --> 22:29.292
with old dykes?

22:29.459 --> 22:30.542
Excuse me?

22:30.709 --> 22:32.667
Dykes? Lezzies?

22:33.126 --> 22:35.501
Lesbians?
You have a problem with them?

22:35.667 --> 22:36.834
Of course not.

22:37.334 --> 22:38.834
You see, Mado?

22:39.334 --> 22:41.084
Do you see, Mado?

22:41.251 --> 22:42.876
Nobody gives a damn!

22:44.876 --> 22:46.126
You're pathetic.

23:44.792 --> 23:46.251
What's that smell?

24:17.709 --> 24:19.459
Stand back, ma'am.

25:06.042 --> 25:07.209
Do you need help?

25:07.792 --> 25:10.376
No, thank you. I'm just tired.

25:10.834 --> 25:13.042
- Are you sure?
- Yes. Thank you.

25:13.209 --> 25:14.584
Mrs. Dorn?

25:14.876 --> 25:16.126
Still here?

25:16.292 --> 25:18.334
I wanted to know how she is.

25:21.667 --> 25:23.292
They're not saying much.

25:25.917 --> 25:27.709
She had a stroke.

25:29.001 --> 25:31.626
They'll keep her
in intensive care tonight.

25:44.834 --> 25:46.501
You can go home now.

25:48.334 --> 25:51.084
Thanks for being there
and calling an ambulance.

26:08.709 --> 26:12.042
You look exhausted.
Go to bed now. It's late.

26:13.876 --> 26:15.584
Can I call you a cab?

26:20.667 --> 26:21.834
No, thanks.

26:29.251 --> 26:30.376
Goodnight.

27:54.501 --> 27:56.584
Stable? What does "stable" mean?

27:56.751 --> 27:59.042
Look, that's all I know, Fred.

28:04.459 --> 28:06.959
I'll do the closet, you take the dresser.

28:18.876 --> 28:20.042
Like that, ok?

28:20.542 --> 28:22.376
No, more underwear.

28:22.876 --> 28:24.959
All she has is a hospital smock.

28:34.167 --> 28:35.542
That's enough, right?

28:35.709 --> 28:37.376
Get her toothbrush too.

28:45.834 --> 28:47.084
Which one of the two?

28:47.251 --> 28:48.876
No idea. Take both.

28:49.042 --> 28:50.084
A towel too.

28:55.417 --> 28:56.501
This all right?

28:56.667 --> 28:59.501
Fred! You can see
they're beach towels.

29:06.209 --> 29:07.876
Here. That should do it.

29:08.042 --> 29:09.834
Don't you think that's too many?

29:11.459 --> 29:13.917
We don't know how long she'll stay.

29:15.084 --> 29:17.251
You think we'll bring her home?

29:17.417 --> 29:18.542
I don't know.

29:18.959 --> 29:21.376
They said to expect long-term effects.

29:21.792 --> 29:23.667
She might not speak again.

33:02.542 --> 33:03.667
Good evening.

33:04.501 --> 33:05.501
Good evening.

33:08.584 --> 33:11.334
Mrs. Girard is back home?

33:11.501 --> 33:13.459
Yes, I'm her caregiver.

33:13.959 --> 33:15.376
You're a friend of hers?

33:16.167 --> 33:17.001
Yes.

33:17.542 --> 33:19.751
I'm Nina, I live opposite.

33:21.751 --> 33:23.001
Can I see her?

33:23.501 --> 33:25.542
It's just that it's already 8 pm.

33:25.709 --> 33:28.334
Mrs. Girard is only just
out of the hospital.

33:29.834 --> 33:30.667
Yes.

33:31.792 --> 33:33.792
- You stay overnight?
- Of course.

33:38.542 --> 33:40.459
- What's your name?
- Muriel.

33:45.084 --> 33:47.542
Please, just for…

33:48.792 --> 33:49.876
two minutes?

33:50.042 --> 33:51.917
Sorry, I just put her to bed.

33:53.126 --> 33:55.001
Come back tomorrow morning.

33:56.959 --> 33:58.126
Yes, of course.

33:58.876 --> 33:59.834
Goodnight.

36:08.042 --> 36:09.542
Mado, look at me.

36:09.959 --> 36:11.167
Here I am.

36:18.876 --> 36:20.084
Forgive me.

36:23.542 --> 36:25.959
For what I said. It wasn't true.

36:26.126 --> 36:27.542
I didn't mean it.

38:33.001 --> 38:34.167
Morning, Muriel.

38:35.709 --> 38:37.042
I brought croissants.

38:37.209 --> 38:38.209
Thanks.

38:38.376 --> 38:40.834
You said to come back this morning.

38:41.292 --> 38:42.501
Yes, of course.

38:43.209 --> 38:44.751
Come in, please.

38:51.001 --> 38:54.084
- You take no risks.
- I heard strange noises last night.

38:54.459 --> 38:57.542
It's a noisy, old building.
You'll get used to it.

38:57.709 --> 39:01.709
Hardly reassuring,
with all the burglaries around here.

39:01.876 --> 39:02.959
Yes, it's awful.

39:03.126 --> 39:04.209
Mrs. Girard?

39:04.376 --> 39:06.334
Your neighbor's here to see you.

39:07.001 --> 39:08.709
Please, take a seat.

39:10.501 --> 39:12.751
- A cup of tea?
- Yes, please.

39:16.959 --> 39:18.042
Madeleine?

39:19.417 --> 39:21.292
She can't speak, I'm sorry.

39:23.751 --> 39:25.251
Her children told me.

39:26.834 --> 39:28.417
But she understands?

39:28.584 --> 39:29.792
I'm not sure.

39:37.459 --> 39:39.417
So you'll be living here?

39:40.584 --> 39:41.542
Yes.

39:42.459 --> 39:43.959
To begin with, at least.

39:49.251 --> 39:52.626
If you ever need help,
knock on my door.

39:53.417 --> 39:56.209
I can sit with Mrs. Girard
when you go shopping.

39:57.334 --> 39:59.667
Her daughter will help me every morning.

40:01.376 --> 40:02.626
But it's very kind.

40:03.459 --> 40:05.376
Mrs. Girard and I are friends.

40:05.542 --> 40:07.292
It's absolutely no bother.

40:07.834 --> 40:10.209
I've been doing this over 20 years.

40:10.542 --> 40:13.042
I'm used to it, but I'll keep it in mind.

40:17.876 --> 40:20.209
The wheelchair's only for now?

40:20.667 --> 40:24.126
Yes, she should gradually
regain mobility.

40:25.459 --> 40:27.542
We could go for a stroll.

40:27.709 --> 40:29.501
It's windy out. Tomorrow.

41:28.417 --> 41:30.751
Hello, you're taking her to the park?

41:30.917 --> 41:32.834
No, I'm going to the store.

41:33.001 --> 41:35.459
I can look after her while you're gone.

41:35.626 --> 41:37.459
Thanks, it's just downstairs.

41:37.626 --> 41:38.876
I mean, I'm here.

41:39.292 --> 41:42.834
Really, don't put yourself out.
It's a little excursion for her.

41:44.084 --> 41:45.209
You're right.

41:46.209 --> 41:49.792
- I'll just dress and come with you.
- Sorry, I must rush.

41:50.292 --> 41:51.584
I understand.

41:54.459 --> 41:55.501
Have a good day.

43:24.501 --> 43:25.751
Who's there?

44:28.584 --> 44:29.626
Muriel, it's me.

44:29.792 --> 44:32.042
Your mother's nearly ready.

44:32.209 --> 44:34.709
I bumped into Mrs. Dorn.
You've met?

44:34.876 --> 44:36.792
- Please…
- Yes, of course.

44:44.001 --> 44:45.459
You watered the plants?

44:45.626 --> 44:46.834
No, sorry.

44:54.834 --> 44:56.876
How does she seem to you, Muriel?

44:57.042 --> 44:58.792
Agitated at night.

44:58.959 --> 45:02.667
It's good if she's moving.
Isn't it a good sign?

45:02.834 --> 45:05.876
It's dangerous for her heart,
if she tires herself out.

45:07.626 --> 45:11.459
Perhaps you could avoid taking her
to the store with you.

45:12.959 --> 45:15.376
Just to the grocery, so she's not alone.

45:15.709 --> 45:19.792
I told you, leave her with me
when you need to go out.

45:20.501 --> 45:22.959
Really?
That's very kind of you.

45:23.126 --> 45:24.334
No problem.

45:37.042 --> 45:38.292
Let me help.

45:49.501 --> 45:50.709
Come on, mom.

45:54.001 --> 45:55.084
Let's go now.

45:57.917 --> 45:59.709
Good, mom. That's great.

46:04.001 --> 46:05.251
Careful.

46:05.876 --> 46:06.751
That's right.

46:06.917 --> 46:10.542
Can you take her to rehab
next Wednesday? I can't do it.

46:11.459 --> 46:13.917
Trouble is, my car's broken down.

46:14.292 --> 46:17.209
That's annoying.
You assured me you had transport.

46:17.751 --> 46:19.209
It's only temporary.

46:20.417 --> 46:22.751
Take my mother's, but be careful.

46:22.917 --> 46:24.042
Yes, of course.

46:24.209 --> 46:26.667
- I'll leave the keys in the hall.
- All right.

47:28.876 --> 47:31.667
I asked you quite specifically
and you said yes.

47:31.834 --> 47:34.417
I said, be careful with the car,
and look…

47:34.584 --> 47:37.417
When we got back, it was just fine.

47:38.876 --> 47:40.167
It's unacceptable…

47:43.501 --> 47:45.334
We'll talk later.

48:24.376 --> 48:25.417
There.

48:30.084 --> 48:31.376
You don't remember?

48:33.084 --> 48:34.042
It's us.

48:37.334 --> 48:38.334
Hold on…

48:39.876 --> 48:41.042
Look, Mado.

48:41.834 --> 48:44.292
It's where we met. It's Rome.

48:48.792 --> 48:49.959
It's Rome.

48:54.209 --> 48:55.251
Hold on…

50:20.001 --> 50:21.126
Nice and easy.

50:22.376 --> 50:24.042
Nice and easy does it.

50:26.917 --> 50:28.751
You walked.

50:30.126 --> 50:31.459
On your own.

50:40.667 --> 50:42.167
What are you doing here?

50:49.626 --> 50:51.042
I'm here for Madeleine.

50:51.376 --> 50:53.084
You shouldn't be here.

50:54.376 --> 50:56.167
It's you who shouldn't be here.

50:56.917 --> 50:59.959
She needs me with her. You understand?

51:00.667 --> 51:04.334
From now on,
I'll be here every day.

51:05.834 --> 51:09.001
Her daughter nearly fired me
over the car.

51:09.834 --> 51:11.834
I cannot afford to lose this job.

51:12.001 --> 51:14.001
Muriel, you won't lose a thing.

51:14.167 --> 51:15.584
That's not what I want.

51:18.251 --> 51:19.417
We can strike a deal.

51:22.251 --> 51:24.417
Keep me out of this.

51:30.876 --> 51:33.167
You let me look after her.

51:35.167 --> 51:38.167
And you'll be paid
for a job you don't do.

51:38.542 --> 51:40.251
It's in your interest.

51:42.959 --> 51:45.501
If you want,
we can go on as before.

51:45.959 --> 51:49.376
I need to pay for the repairs
to Mrs. Girard's car.

51:49.584 --> 51:51.167
I'll cover it.

51:51.376 --> 51:52.667
How much do you need?

51:53.542 --> 51:54.626
300 euros.

51:55.292 --> 51:56.001
All right.

51:58.251 --> 51:59.334
Every month.

52:06.709 --> 52:07.751
Very well.

52:15.501 --> 52:17.751
Madeleine needs some rest now.

52:20.334 --> 52:22.459
I'll be back tomorrow with the money.

52:54.084 --> 52:55.917
Is Mrs. Girard with you?

52:56.084 --> 52:57.417
Why? No.

52:58.126 --> 52:59.251
She's gone.

52:59.959 --> 53:01.709
What do you mean, gone?

53:02.042 --> 53:03.001
She's disappeared.

53:03.167 --> 53:05.876
When I came out of the shower,
the door was open.

53:06.209 --> 53:08.209
- You didn't lock it?
- Don't blame me.

53:08.792 --> 53:11.042
You shook her up yesterday.

53:11.959 --> 53:13.126
Come on.

53:16.334 --> 53:17.792
We'll split up here.

54:04.501 --> 54:06.876
There you are. Her daughter's here.

54:07.042 --> 54:09.334
She's waiting in her car, not far.

54:14.959 --> 54:16.251
I'm so sorry.

54:16.834 --> 54:18.917
I don't understand how it happened.

54:19.084 --> 54:21.209
When did you realize?

54:21.376 --> 54:22.876
She went for a shower

54:23.209 --> 54:25.084
and left the front door open and…

54:25.251 --> 54:26.501
Madeleine walked out.

54:26.667 --> 54:28.417
You left the front door open?

54:31.626 --> 54:32.709
Perhaps.

54:34.209 --> 54:35.834
Did you leave it open or not?

54:37.334 --> 54:38.917
I'm not sure.

54:55.542 --> 54:57.042
Yes, speaking.

55:00.834 --> 55:02.001
Where?

55:04.667 --> 55:06.459
Someone spotted her looking lost.

55:06.626 --> 55:08.001
- Thank you.
- No problem.

55:09.667 --> 55:10.792
Are you ok?

55:11.459 --> 55:12.709
I was so worried.

55:26.334 --> 55:27.959
Thanks again for being there.

55:29.876 --> 55:31.334
No worries.

57:50.876 --> 57:52.459
Listen to this, Mado.

57:53.584 --> 57:55.417
It happened where I'm from.

57:55.917 --> 57:57.834
"Caught at Berlin airport

57:58.001 --> 58:01.459
"with her husband's intestines
in her bags.

58:02.251 --> 58:05.584
"She refused to be separated
from the love of her life."

58:08.126 --> 58:11.334
I'm a romantic,
but that's going a bit far.

58:32.709 --> 58:33.667
Evening, Nina.

58:33.834 --> 58:35.376
Evening. You're back already?

58:35.542 --> 58:37.209
Yes. How was she today?

58:37.917 --> 58:39.209
Same as usual.

58:39.542 --> 58:41.626
You remember the cat I mentioned?

58:43.251 --> 58:44.459
This is Bart.

58:44.626 --> 58:45.959
The only one left.

58:46.459 --> 58:48.751
I thought he'd keep you company.

58:48.917 --> 58:50.001
Like him?

58:51.626 --> 58:53.542
Yes, he's cute.

58:57.626 --> 59:01.167
I get the feeling
your mother isn't so good as before.

59:01.334 --> 59:02.542
Yes, I know.

59:02.876 --> 59:05.917
After the other day,
they upped the dose of beta-blockers.

59:06.084 --> 59:08.084
To keep her blood pressure under control.

59:08.251 --> 59:09.917
You think that's a good idea?

59:10.084 --> 59:12.792
We followed the doctor's advice.
I'm not sure.

59:13.417 --> 59:14.917
When I see her like this…

59:16.834 --> 59:18.667
Well, I'll be going.

59:19.209 --> 59:22.459
Stay for dinner. I'm alone.
Théo's with his father.

59:22.626 --> 59:24.917
- I won't bother you.
- Don't be silly.

59:25.084 --> 59:27.126
And I'll show you how to handle Bart.

59:29.126 --> 59:31.542
You've done so much
these last few days.

59:34.334 --> 59:36.501
Your mother and I are friends.

59:38.126 --> 59:40.959
She did so much for me
when I moved here.

59:42.251 --> 59:44.667
How long have you lived in France?

59:48.292 --> 59:51.376
Let's say it's a long time
since I left Berlin.

59:54.584 --> 59:56.459
I lived here and there.

59:59.042 --> 1:00:00.126
How come?

1:00:00.876 --> 1:00:03.667
I was a tour guide, mostly in big cities.

1:00:03.834 --> 1:00:05.584
You must have seen so much.

1:00:08.459 --> 1:00:09.542
Yes.

1:00:11.292 --> 1:00:13.792
I also like the peace and quiet here.

1:00:15.251 --> 1:00:18.042
It's funny, though,
choosing to retire here.

1:00:18.209 --> 1:00:21.167
Generally, people head for the Riviera.

1:00:23.667 --> 1:00:24.667
Yes.

1:00:26.917 --> 1:00:29.376
But I love it here.

1:00:32.292 --> 1:00:34.792
I was looking for something in the area.

1:00:34.959 --> 1:00:37.667
Three years ago,
I came across my apartment.

1:00:38.126 --> 1:00:41.876
It had been empty so long
I got it at a knockdown price.

1:00:42.167 --> 1:00:43.376
There we go.

1:00:49.626 --> 1:00:51.959
You don't like living here?

1:00:52.292 --> 1:00:54.834
It's not that. I'd never move away.

1:00:55.001 --> 1:00:57.042
But not everybody's like me.

1:00:57.459 --> 1:00:59.876
I think my mother wished she'd moved.

1:01:00.042 --> 1:01:01.667
What makes you say that?

1:01:02.751 --> 1:01:05.292
We were always very close,
the two of us.

1:01:06.084 --> 1:01:08.292
I know she wanted to travel,
wanted to…

1:01:09.167 --> 1:01:10.334
leave this town.

1:01:11.417 --> 1:01:13.709
She sacrificed herself for her family.

1:01:15.501 --> 1:01:17.876
It's not always the best thing to do.

1:01:18.917 --> 1:01:21.167
My ex-husband would agree with you.

1:01:23.126 --> 1:01:24.501
You never married?

1:01:24.667 --> 1:01:25.626
No.

1:01:27.084 --> 1:01:29.001
My father tyrannized my mother.

1:01:29.792 --> 1:01:31.834
But she stayed. She never left.

1:01:34.084 --> 1:01:35.959
It's beautiful in one way.

1:01:37.667 --> 1:01:39.876
I wish someone loved me like that.

1:01:41.251 --> 1:01:44.126
Mom never tried to start over
after his death.

1:01:46.001 --> 1:01:48.001
He was her only true love.

1:01:50.959 --> 1:01:53.334
Mom, look at the soldiers on the photo.

1:01:55.042 --> 1:01:56.542
Sorry, kitten?

1:01:56.834 --> 1:01:58.417
Look at the soldiers.

1:02:02.167 --> 1:02:03.042
What's that?

1:02:03.917 --> 1:02:06.167
That's the Colosseum in Rome.

1:02:08.751 --> 1:02:10.459
And there is Granny.

1:02:10.792 --> 1:02:12.001
So young.

1:02:12.167 --> 1:02:13.959
About the same age as me there.

1:02:16.417 --> 1:02:18.709
Funny, that could be Mrs. Dorn.

1:02:18.876 --> 1:02:20.876
- What? There?
- Yes, there.

1:02:39.626 --> 1:02:40.792
I'm coming!

1:02:55.251 --> 1:02:56.334
Madeleine!

1:02:56.667 --> 1:02:57.751
What are you doing?

1:03:00.542 --> 1:03:02.709
I don't understand what's going on.

1:03:02.876 --> 1:03:04.751
Perhaps it's her medication.

1:03:04.917 --> 1:03:07.126
Madeleine, look. Your daughter's here.

1:03:11.626 --> 1:03:14.126
- You need help?
- No, thanks, it's fine.

1:03:14.292 --> 1:03:15.917
- You're sure?
- Positive.

1:04:35.667 --> 1:04:37.167
What are you doing?

1:04:42.292 --> 1:04:43.751
Stop that, mom.

1:04:44.292 --> 1:04:46.459
Stop. Stop that.

1:04:48.126 --> 1:04:50.126
What are you doing?

1:04:52.626 --> 1:04:54.334
Give me that. No, stop.

1:05:02.001 --> 1:05:03.167
Give me that!

1:05:04.459 --> 1:05:05.542
Mom!

1:05:23.542 --> 1:05:25.042
What are you doing?

1:08:28.876 --> 1:08:29.917
Get out.

1:08:32.834 --> 1:08:34.001
Get out!

1:10:14.167 --> 1:10:15.209
Same again.

1:10:16.001 --> 1:10:18.167
No more tonight. We're closed.

1:10:21.834 --> 1:10:23.292
Pain in the ass.

1:10:36.292 --> 1:10:37.917
Pain in the ass.

1:10:56.126 --> 1:10:57.917
What on earth are you doing?

1:10:58.251 --> 1:10:59.126
Hello.

1:11:00.167 --> 1:11:02.459
The owner told us to change the locks.

1:11:05.084 --> 1:11:07.209
You can't just walk in.

1:11:25.334 --> 1:11:27.042
I understand, yes. Goodbye.

1:11:43.084 --> 1:11:44.084
Anne…

1:11:45.251 --> 1:11:47.709
You can't keep ignoring me like this.

1:11:48.376 --> 1:11:49.876
Call me back, please.

1:11:50.042 --> 1:11:52.459
My number is 06

1:11:52.626 --> 1:11:56.501
23 22 20 72.

1:11:57.126 --> 1:11:58.126
Thank you.

1:12:27.751 --> 1:12:29.501
Ma'am, open up, please.

1:12:30.209 --> 1:12:32.334
We just came to talk.

1:12:43.501 --> 1:12:45.084
Thank you for opening up.

1:12:45.917 --> 1:12:47.959
This is awkward, right.

1:12:48.126 --> 1:12:50.292
- My mother lost her job.
- I know.

1:12:50.459 --> 1:12:52.292
- It's very unfortunate.
- Yeah, right.

1:12:52.626 --> 1:12:54.126
Mom, leave this to me.

1:12:54.751 --> 1:12:56.626
She said you had a deal.

1:12:56.792 --> 1:12:59.709
You agreed to pay her
a certain sum for…

1:13:00.167 --> 1:13:03.001
You know, the favor she did you.

1:13:03.667 --> 1:13:05.501
The favor she did me?

1:13:06.251 --> 1:13:07.376
Is this a joke?

1:13:07.542 --> 1:13:10.376
We wouldn't be here
if you'd left her patient alone.

1:13:10.542 --> 1:13:12.501
Hand over the money, period.

1:13:12.667 --> 1:13:14.209
Who do you think you are?

1:13:14.376 --> 1:13:16.584
I told you she'd try to cross us.

1:13:16.751 --> 1:13:19.001
Do what we say
or you'll regret it.

1:13:20.501 --> 1:13:21.667
Go fuck yourselves.

1:13:23.709 --> 1:13:25.167
This isn't an end to this.

1:13:25.959 --> 1:13:27.667
Who do you think you are?

1:13:29.042 --> 1:13:31.334
You won't get rid of me so easily.

1:13:36.209 --> 1:13:38.334
Is it normal for her to be asleep?

1:13:41.751 --> 1:13:44.251
Yes, she must be tired, that's all.

1:14:22.834 --> 1:14:24.834
Want to stay for dinner with us?

1:14:25.001 --> 1:14:26.001
Yes.

1:14:36.084 --> 1:14:38.126
The hospice was a bad idea.

1:14:38.292 --> 1:14:40.001
It's best for her.

1:14:46.709 --> 1:14:48.626
- We take her home.
- No.

1:14:48.792 --> 1:14:50.584
- Hire a new caregiver.
- No way.

1:14:52.251 --> 1:14:53.626
Face it, she's unhappy.

1:14:53.792 --> 1:14:57.126
You don't get it.
She cannot go back home.

1:15:06.292 --> 1:15:07.584
Anne, are you ok?

1:15:11.376 --> 1:15:12.626
What's wrong?

1:16:47.584 --> 1:16:49.459
What do you want now?

1:16:50.084 --> 1:16:52.751
- I must talk to you.
- There's nothing to say.

1:16:54.709 --> 1:16:55.917
I've got this.

1:16:56.917 --> 1:17:00.626
- Go away.
- I just want to explain how things are.

1:17:00.959 --> 1:17:03.292
- Haven't you done enough?
- Let me in.

1:17:04.417 --> 1:17:05.751
You need to know.

1:17:05.917 --> 1:17:08.917
Your mother wanted
to move away with me.

1:17:09.084 --> 1:17:12.709
She never loved your father,
she couldn't bear him.

1:17:12.876 --> 1:17:15.501
She lied to you for the last 20 years.

1:17:16.209 --> 1:17:17.876
I'm her true love.

1:17:20.417 --> 1:17:21.542
Go away.

1:17:22.917 --> 1:17:24.626
You're dimwits.

1:17:26.376 --> 1:17:28.334
Go or I'll call the police.

1:18:27.542 --> 1:18:29.167
You're thinking of her?

1:18:47.667 --> 1:18:50.459
Morning, Mrs. Girard.
How are you today?

1:18:50.876 --> 1:18:52.376
It seems worse and worse.

1:18:52.542 --> 1:18:55.084
There are ups and downs in these cases.

1:19:00.042 --> 1:19:02.501
- What's all that?
- Her new medication.

1:19:02.917 --> 1:19:05.417
I never agreed to new medication.

1:19:05.584 --> 1:19:09.667
I'm just following instructions.
She's been unstable recently.

1:19:09.834 --> 1:19:11.834
That's how you solve the issue?

1:19:12.417 --> 1:19:14.792
By drugging them up until they obey.

1:19:15.376 --> 1:19:16.917
I'm just doing my job.

1:19:18.917 --> 1:19:20.126
59.

1:19:23.584 --> 1:19:24.751
89.

1:19:28.376 --> 1:19:30.667
- 47.
- Not playing?

1:19:31.626 --> 1:19:32.667
Come on…

1:19:33.251 --> 1:19:35.292
They called number 47.

1:19:37.709 --> 1:19:38.626
7.

1:19:44.251 --> 1:19:45.209
17.

1:19:54.251 --> 1:19:54.959
9.

1:20:02.667 --> 1:20:03.792
32.

1:21:11.876 --> 1:21:14.542
Sorry, this is
Bellecroix Retirement Home.

1:21:14.709 --> 1:21:16.126
No, no problem.

1:21:16.292 --> 1:21:18.292
A patient called you by mistake.

1:21:18.626 --> 1:21:19.751
Hold on.

1:21:21.959 --> 1:21:24.126
Which home did you say?

1:22:05.042 --> 1:22:06.751
- You're a relation?
- No.

1:22:07.626 --> 1:22:09.251
I'm an old friend.

1:22:09.917 --> 1:22:11.626
Her daughter's here too.

1:22:11.876 --> 1:22:14.459
If you want a word,
she's with the director.

1:22:43.917 --> 1:22:47.084
It's the best we can do
to restore her calm.

1:22:47.542 --> 1:22:49.751
Her blood pressure was worryingly high.

1:22:49.917 --> 1:22:53.084
Your mother's situation
is difficult to live with.

1:22:53.709 --> 1:22:57.334
But you cannot interrupt
a course of treatment.

1:23:27.417 --> 1:23:30.376
This protocol is standard procedure.

1:23:30.542 --> 1:23:32.876
And perfectly suited to your mother.

1:23:33.042 --> 1:23:36.584
We should have talked you through it.
I apologize.

1:23:37.751 --> 1:23:40.542
I promise you
she's getting the best possible care.

1:23:41.751 --> 1:23:43.209
Do you understand?

1:23:44.501 --> 1:23:45.751
Yes, of course.

1:24:28.709 --> 1:24:30.042
Come on, Mado.

1:24:30.209 --> 1:24:31.542
Quickly!

1:24:32.834 --> 1:24:35.751
You need to change.
You can't stay like that.

1:24:37.876 --> 1:24:39.417
We don't need much.

1:24:40.001 --> 1:24:41.209
We take the money.

1:24:41.584 --> 1:24:42.792
And clothes.

1:24:43.292 --> 1:24:44.417
All the rest

1:24:45.001 --> 1:24:46.209
can wait till Italy.

1:25:06.167 --> 1:25:07.542
How did you get there?

1:27:39.417 --> 1:27:41.042
I know you're in there.

1:27:41.209 --> 1:27:43.542
I saw you leaving,
and the car outside.

1:27:45.376 --> 1:27:47.584
Don't do anything stupid, please.

1:27:50.001 --> 1:27:51.501
I'm sorry.

1:27:52.667 --> 1:27:54.084
Mom, please.

1:28:02.126 --> 1:28:04.792
Mom, I'm here. We can talk.

1:28:04.959 --> 1:28:06.501
We can talk now.

1:28:08.709 --> 1:28:10.626
Open up.

1:28:17.084 --> 1:28:18.667
I didn't realize.

1:28:23.209 --> 1:28:24.376
Mom!

1:28:27.584 --> 1:28:28.667
Nina.

1:28:32.501 --> 1:28:34.292
Open the door. Mom!

1:29:35.209 --> 1:29:38.167
You'll live with me

1:29:38.792 --> 1:29:42.042
On a fantastic island

1:29:43.251 --> 1:29:46.251
And you'll see a world up there

1:29:46.709 --> 1:29:49.501
A world concealed in blue

1:29:50.584 --> 1:29:53.334
A brand new world for you

1:29:54.376 --> 1:29:56.542
The Earth, the Earth…

1:29:57.584 --> 1:29:59.542
Will have no borders

1:29:59.959 --> 1:30:01.334
The Earth, the Earth…

1:30:01.709 --> 1:30:04.917
The moon will bring us good luck

1:30:05.292 --> 1:30:06.917
It will be our future

1:30:07.167 --> 1:30:09.042
If you love me, if you love me…
