WEBVTT

00:02.393 --> 00:03.655
PUT HIM IN THE PLAYPEN.

00:03.829 --> 00:04.787
I DON'T WANT HIM SEEING THIS.BUT PHOEBE...

00:04.961 --> 00:06.789
JUST DO IT!

00:06.963 --> 00:09.487
OK, THERE YOU GO.

00:09.661 --> 00:11.359
THERE YOU GO.

00:11.533 --> 00:13.361
DON'T LET HIM
OUT OF YOUR SIGHT.

00:14.840 --> 00:15.928
WHAT'S WRONG?
WHAT'S TAKING SO LONG?

00:16.103 --> 00:17.582
I DON'T KNOW.

00:17.756 --> 00:19.628
DAMN IT, LEO, YOU SHOULD
HAVE JUST HEALED HER OUTSIDE.

00:19.802 --> 00:22.935
RIGHT, AND RISK YOU
GETTING SHOT, TOO?
I DON'T THINK SO.

00:23.110 --> 00:24.546
OK, SO I JUST SENT
OUR EVIL TWINS

00:24.720 --> 00:26.678
THROUGH THE PORTAL,
ALTHOUGH...

00:26.852 --> 00:28.854
WHAT HAPPENED?

00:29.029 --> 00:30.900
[GASPS]

00:31.074 --> 00:32.597
THANK GOD.STAY WITH WYATT.

00:32.771 --> 00:33.816
I GOT HIM.

00:35.687 --> 00:36.949
YOU OK?

00:37.124 --> 00:39.082
YEAH. JUST REMIND ME

00:39.256 --> 00:41.867
TO NEVER PARK ON
MRS. NOBLE'S DRIVEWAY AGAIN.

00:42.042 --> 00:43.739
WILL SOMEONE PLEASE
TELL ME WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON HERE?

00:43.913 --> 00:45.828
THE NEIGHBORHOOD PATROL
SHOT HER POINT BLANK

00:46.002 --> 00:47.482
AND NOBODY SO MUCH
AS BLINKED AN EYE.

00:47.656 --> 00:49.397
WHAT? WHY?

00:49.571 --> 00:51.007
BECAUSE BY GETTING US
ALL TO THE EVIL WORLD,

00:51.181 --> 00:52.313
GIDEON SCREWED UP
THE BALANCE,

00:52.487 --> 00:53.575
MESSED WITH
THE GRAND DESIGN.

00:53.749 --> 00:55.098
WELL, IF YOU ASK ME,
THE GRAND DESIGN

00:55.272 --> 00:56.578
IS PRETTY MESSED UP
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

00:56.752 --> 00:58.145
WAIT, SO ARE YOU SAYING
BECAUSE OF WHAT HE DID,

00:58.319 --> 00:59.798
OUR WORLD IS BAD NOW, TOO?

00:59.972 --> 01:02.279
NO, ON THE CONTRARY.
IT'S GOOD, TOO GOOD,

01:02.453 --> 01:03.628
WHERE EVERY
LITTLE INFRACTION

01:03.802 --> 01:04.716
IS A CAPITAL OFFENSE,

01:04.890 --> 01:06.283
AND EVERYONE
JUST ACCEPTS IT.

01:06.457 --> 01:07.719
OH, SO WE'RE STARRING
IN A LITTLE MOVIE

01:07.893 --> 01:09.852
CALLED
PLEASANTVILLE?

01:10.026 --> 01:12.333
OK, HOW COME
WE WEREN'T AFFECTED?

01:12.507 --> 01:13.638
BECAUSE WE MUST HAVE BEEN

01:13.812 --> 01:15.162
CROSSING OVER WHEN
THE SHIFT OCCURRED.

01:15.336 --> 01:16.293
WELL, THAT MUST MEAN

01:16.467 --> 01:17.816
GIDEON'S NOT AFFECTED,
EITHER.

01:17.990 --> 01:20.167
NO, HE WOULDN'T BE
BECAUSE HE'S AN ELDER.

01:20.341 --> 01:21.820
HOW DO WE KNOW HE'S NOT
USING THE SITUATION
TO HIS ADVANTAGE,

01:21.994 --> 01:23.083
YOU KNOW, COME AFTER
WYATT AGAIN?

01:23.257 --> 01:24.562
BECAUSE I'M GONNA
FIND HIM FIRST.

01:24.736 --> 01:26.042
NO, YOU CAN'T
HURT HIM, LEO,

01:26.216 --> 01:27.696
NOT UNTIL HE SHIFTS
THE BALANCE BACK,

01:27.870 --> 01:29.567
AND YOU KNOW HE KNOWS
HOW TO DO THAT.

01:31.091 --> 01:33.005
OH, MY GOD.
WE TOTALLY FORGOT
ABOUT PIPER.

01:33.180 --> 01:34.311
WE HAVE TO GET
TO THE HOSPITAL.

01:34.485 --> 01:35.443
WHO'S GONNA WATCH WYATT?

01:35.617 --> 01:37.009
I WILL.

01:37.184 --> 01:38.707
LOOK, I DIDN'T COME
ALL THE WAY FROM THE FUTURE

01:38.881 --> 01:40.361
JUST TO LOSE HIM NOW,
ALL RIGHT?

01:46.410 --> 01:49.544
I THINK WE SHOULD DRIVE.
I DON'T WANT TO RISK ORBING.

01:49.718 --> 01:52.808
HEY, JUST WATCH
YOUR SPEED, OK?

02:58.178 --> 02:59.657
OH, GIVE ME A BREAK.

03:01.268 --> 03:05.185
Gideon: YOU'RE LUCKY.
IT COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE.

03:05.359 --> 03:07.796
WELL, WELL, WELL,
WELL, WELL, WELL.

03:07.970 --> 03:10.146
THE NEW PEEPING ELDER.

03:10.320 --> 03:14.194
HOW THE MIGHTY HAVE FALLEN,
SO TO SPEAK.

03:14.368 --> 03:15.543
SHOW YOURSELF.

03:15.717 --> 03:18.110
Gideon: ONLY IF YOU
AGREE TO A TRUCE.

03:18.285 --> 03:21.984
I PROMISE, IT IS
IN YOUR BEST INTERESTS.

03:22.158 --> 03:23.420
WHY NOT?

03:23.594 --> 03:27.598
THIS PARTICULAR DAY
COULDN'T GET MUCH WORSE.

03:27.772 --> 03:29.774
ACTUALLY, IT COULD.

03:29.948 --> 03:31.602
YOU COULD DIE.

03:31.776 --> 03:34.388
THE WORLD HAS
CHANGED, MY FRIEND,

03:34.562 --> 03:36.390
AS YOU'VE OBVIOUSLY
JUST WITNESSED.

03:36.564 --> 03:37.652
IF YOU'RE REFERRING

03:37.826 --> 03:40.394
TO THE WITCHES
CONSTANTLY HUNTING ME,

03:40.568 --> 03:44.006
THAT WOULDN'T HAPPEN
TO BE SOME OF YOUR DOING,

03:44.180 --> 03:46.356
NOW WOULD IT, FRIEND?

03:46.530 --> 03:50.273
NOT BY INTENT,
BUT IT'S WHY I'M HERE.

03:50.447 --> 03:53.711
IF I'M TO SHIFT THINGS BACK
TO THE WAY THINGS WERE,

03:53.885 --> 03:56.584
TO GIVE EVIL A FIGHTING
CHANCE AGAIN,

03:56.758 --> 04:00.109
THEN YOU AND I
MUST WORK TOGETHER.

04:00.283 --> 04:02.764
NOW WHY WOULD
YOU WANT TO GIVE ME

04:02.938 --> 04:04.156
A FIGHTING CHANCE?

04:04.331 --> 04:07.029
TO RESTORE THE BALANCE,

04:07.203 --> 04:09.553
THE GRAND DESIGN,

04:09.727 --> 04:12.730
AS I AM
HONOR-BOUND TO DO.

04:12.904 --> 04:15.690
JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY,

04:15.864 --> 04:20.260
HOW IS IT THIS, UH,
IMBALANCE HAPPENED
TO OCCUR?

04:22.610 --> 04:24.089
COME ON.

04:24.264 --> 04:25.482
YOU CAN SAY IT.

04:25.656 --> 04:27.267
I KNOW YOU CAN.

04:27.441 --> 04:29.791
"I MADE MY MOVE
ON THE BOY,

04:29.965 --> 04:31.923
AND I SCREWED UP."

04:32.097 --> 04:34.622
I TOOK
A CALCULATED RISK.

04:34.796 --> 04:36.624
YOU SCREWED UP.

04:36.798 --> 04:42.020
NOW YOU WANT TO HIDE OUT
DOWN HERE WITH ME,

04:42.194 --> 04:44.327
AND JUST HOPE THAT
THE BOY'S AUNTIES

04:44.501 --> 04:46.721
DON'T KNOW HOW
TO FIND YOU.

04:46.895 --> 04:49.985
ISN'T THAT ABOUT RIGHT,
FRIEND?

04:50.159 --> 04:53.336
BELIEVE ME,
YOU DON'T WANT
THIS CHILD GROWING UP

04:53.510 --> 04:56.252
ANY MORE THAN I DO,
BARBAS.

04:56.426 --> 04:58.080
HIS POWER IS TOO GREAT.

04:58.254 --> 05:02.302
HE IS AN ENORMOUS THREAT
TO BOTH OF US.

05:03.651 --> 05:06.175
I SEE.

05:08.177 --> 05:10.048
ANY SHIFT BETWEEN
GOOD AND EVIL

05:10.222 --> 05:13.530
IS SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN
NATURALLY OVER TIME.

05:13.704 --> 05:16.316
BY INTERVENING,
I'VE ALLOWED TOO MUCH GOOD

05:16.490 --> 05:18.013
TO CORRUPT THE OTHER WORLD,

05:18.187 --> 05:20.842
AND THE ONLY WAY
TO GET IT BACK

05:21.016 --> 05:24.585
IS FOR A GREAT EVIL
TO CORRUPT OURS.

05:24.759 --> 05:28.328
OH, AND YOU JUST
NATURALLY THOUGHT OF ME?

05:28.502 --> 05:29.851
I'M VERY FLATTERED.

05:30.025 --> 05:32.114
I HAVE TO COMPLETE
WHAT I STARTED,

05:32.288 --> 05:35.030
FOR EVERYONE'S SAKE.

05:35.204 --> 05:38.990
HELP ME DISTRACT
THE SISTERS...

05:39.164 --> 05:44.039
AND I WILL HELP YOU
GET YOUR WORLD BACK.

05:49.174 --> 05:51.960
Man: YOU WON'T FIND
GIDEON THAT WAY.

05:54.049 --> 05:55.398
WE'VE ALREADY TRIED.

05:57.574 --> 05:58.967
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

05:59.141 --> 06:01.317
I AM HERE TO REMIND YOU
OF YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES.

06:01.491 --> 06:03.406
MY RESPONSIBILITIES
RIGHT NOW ARE TO
PROTECT MY SON.

06:03.580 --> 06:06.061
HOW, BY TAKING REVENGE
ON ONE OF OUR OWN?

06:06.235 --> 06:07.323
GIDEON STOPPED
BEING ONE OF US

06:07.497 --> 06:08.629
WHEN HE WENT
AFTER WYATT.

06:08.803 --> 06:11.022
OH, THAT'S NOT
FOR YOU TO DECIDE.

06:11.196 --> 06:13.895
YOU'RE BUT ONE VOICE
IN A CHORUS, LEO.

06:14.069 --> 06:16.463
WE CAN'T ALLOW YOU TO TAKE
MATTERS INTO YOUR OWN HANDS.

06:16.637 --> 06:17.638
GIDEON DID.

06:17.812 --> 06:19.117
YES, AND LOOK
WHAT HE'S WROUGHT.

06:19.291 --> 06:20.902
THE WORLD IS SPIRALING
OUT OF CONTROL.

06:21.076 --> 06:22.556
INNOCENTS ARE BEING HURT--

06:22.730 --> 06:26.734
KILLED--ALL BECAUSE
ONE ELDER ACTED ALONE.

06:26.908 --> 06:28.300
I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.

06:28.475 --> 06:30.912
OH, GIDEON THOUGHT HE KNEW
WHAT HE WAS DOING, TOO.

06:31.086 --> 06:33.262
TRUTH BE KNOWN,
HE WAS NOT ALONE

06:33.436 --> 06:34.742
IN HIS THINKING.

06:34.916 --> 06:37.527
THERE ARE OTHERS WHO SHARE
HIS FEARS OF WYATT,

06:37.701 --> 06:39.964
THAT YOUR UNION
WITH A CHARMED ONE

06:40.138 --> 06:42.750
MIGHT'VE CREATED TOO GREAT
A CONCENTRATION OF POWER.

06:42.924 --> 06:44.012
WAIT, SO YOU'RE
ON HIS SIDE?

06:44.186 --> 06:45.796
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

06:45.970 --> 06:48.408
WHAT GIDEON'S DONE
IS INEXCUSABLE.

06:48.582 --> 06:49.757
THEN LET ME HANDLE HIM.

06:49.931 --> 06:51.280
PLEASE, LEO,

06:51.454 --> 06:53.804
YOUR EMOTIONS ARE CLOUDING
YOUR BETTER JUDGMENT.

06:53.978 --> 06:55.284
THE FATE OF THE WORLD

06:55.458 --> 06:57.895
IS MORE IMPORTANT
THAN ANY ONE CHILD.

06:58.069 --> 06:59.593
NOT MORE IMPORTANT
THAN MY SON.

06:59.767 --> 07:02.465
THEY'RE ALL YOUR SONS,
YOUR DAUGHTERS.

07:02.639 --> 07:04.424
THEY'RE WHO YOU
SHOULD BE PROTECTING.

07:04.598 --> 07:06.251
THAT'S THE GREATER GOOD.

07:06.426 --> 07:08.471
COME...

07:08.645 --> 07:10.908
HELP US FIND A WAY
TO RESTORE WHAT WAS

07:11.082 --> 07:12.562
WHILE WE STILL CAN.

07:12.736 --> 07:15.260
I CAN'T.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.437
NOT UNTIL I STOP GIDEON.

07:23.312 --> 07:25.749
P.A.: ANY IMMUNOLOGISTS
TO THE QUARANTINE.

07:25.923 --> 07:27.577
ANY IMMUNOLOGISTS
TO THE QUARANTINE.

07:27.751 --> 07:29.100
Woman: YOU'RE
ALL DONE, SIR.

07:29.274 --> 07:30.711
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS PAY YOUR FINE.

07:30.885 --> 07:32.060
OK.

07:32.234 --> 07:35.411
[CHATTER]

07:35.585 --> 07:37.326
WOW, IT'S, UH...

07:37.500 --> 07:40.851
JUST AS CREEPY IN HERE
AS IT IS OUT THERE.

07:41.025 --> 07:43.985
ACTUALLY, CREEPIER.

07:44.159 --> 07:45.639
AH, WELCOME
TO SAN FRANCISCO MEMORIAL.

07:45.813 --> 07:47.336
HOW CAN I HELP,
HELP, HELP YOU?

07:47.510 --> 07:49.294
WELL, YOU COULD
TAKE IT DOWN A NOTCH.

07:49.469 --> 07:51.514
OHH, SHE'S KIDDING.
[LAUGHS]

07:51.688 --> 07:53.124
SHE'S A KIDDER.

07:53.298 --> 07:55.475
UH, JUST OUT
OF CURIOSITY,
WHAT HAPPENED HERE?

07:55.649 --> 07:56.867
WAS IT
A FREEWAY ACCIDENT?

07:57.041 --> 07:58.303
OH, HEAVENS, NO!

07:58.478 --> 07:59.957
IT'S ALWAYS LIKE
THIS AROUND HERE.

08:00.131 --> 08:02.046
[WHISPERS]
Lawbreakers, you know.

08:02.220 --> 08:03.178
RIGHT.

08:03.352 --> 08:04.266
YOU VISITING?

08:04.440 --> 08:05.528
UH, YES.
PIPER HALLIWELL?

08:05.702 --> 08:07.791
HALLIWELL, HALLIWELL...

08:07.965 --> 08:08.966
UH, WHAT WAS HER OFFENSE?

08:09.140 --> 08:10.881
OH, NO, NO OFFENSE.

08:11.055 --> 08:12.274
SHE'S HAVING A BABY.

08:12.448 --> 08:15.320
OHH, A BABY! OHH,
WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SO?!

08:15.495 --> 08:17.148
'CAUSE WE WERE
JUST TOO EXCITED.

08:17.322 --> 08:18.585
OH, OF COURSE YOU ARE!

08:18.759 --> 08:20.674
THERE'S NOTHING
MORE EXCITING THAN A BABY!

08:20.848 --> 08:22.589
UH, ROOM 1402,

08:22.763 --> 08:23.720
BUT DON'T DAWDLE.

08:23.894 --> 08:25.200
VISITING HOURS
ARE ALMOST OVER.

08:25.374 --> 08:26.810
YOU HAVE A WONDERFUL DAY,
NOW, OK?

08:26.984 --> 08:28.595
DAY?

08:30.031 --> 08:31.989
IT'S ALMOST 8:00.
IT SHOULD BE DARK NOW.

08:32.163 --> 08:33.687
DARK?

08:33.861 --> 08:35.950
WHY ON EARTH WOULD ANYONE
SAY SUCH A DEPRESSING THING?

08:36.124 --> 08:37.429
IMAGINE THE SUN GOING AWAY,

08:37.604 --> 08:38.735
NOT HAVING SUNSHINE
ALL THE TIME!

08:38.909 --> 08:40.302
ANYONE WHO'D WANT THAT
SHOULD BE, WELL--

08:40.476 --> 08:41.521
WELL, SHOT!

08:43.348 --> 08:45.612
[LAUGHS] SHE'S JOKING!

08:45.786 --> 08:47.657
THAT'S MY SISTER
THE JOKESTER!

08:47.831 --> 08:48.876
WE'RE GONNA GO SEE
OUR OTHER SISTER NOW.

08:49.050 --> 08:51.313
SHE'S HAVING A BABY.
YEAH.

08:51.487 --> 08:53.445
OK. HAVE A GOOD DAY...

08:53.620 --> 08:55.012
EVERYONE.

09:04.587 --> 09:06.589
OH, THERE YOU GUYS ARE.
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

09:06.763 --> 09:08.722
SHE SEEMS NORMAL.COME ON, COME IN.

09:08.896 --> 09:10.158
PIPER...

09:10.332 --> 09:11.159
ARE YOU OK?

09:11.333 --> 09:12.639
OF COURSE I'M OK.

09:12.813 --> 09:14.510
I'M HAVING A BABY,
FOR CRYING OUT LOUD.

09:14.684 --> 09:16.512
JELL-O?
IT'S REALLY YUMMY.

09:16.686 --> 09:18.296
NO, THANKS.

09:18.470 --> 09:19.646
EXCUSE ME.

09:19.820 --> 09:20.951
HOW'D YOU LIKE
YOUR DINNER?

09:21.125 --> 09:22.257
ARE YOU KIDDING?

09:22.431 --> 09:24.259
THE FROZEN PEAS
AND PROCESSED TURKEY?

09:24.433 --> 09:25.521
IT WAS TO DIE FOR.

09:25.695 --> 09:26.827
[CHUCKLES]

09:27.001 --> 09:28.524
OH, HERE, LET ME
GIVE YOU A HAND.

09:30.134 --> 09:31.745
OOPS!
[LAUGHS]

09:31.919 --> 09:32.963
[LAUGHS]

09:33.137 --> 09:34.443
PIPER, THAT'S
NOT FUNNY.

09:34.617 --> 09:35.705
OH, THAT'S OK.

09:35.879 --> 09:37.141
IT'S MY FAULT
IT EVEN HAPPENED.

09:37.315 --> 09:38.578
WHY IS IT YOUR FAULT?

09:38.752 --> 09:40.144
OH, I USED
MY CELL PHONE
IN THE HOSPITAL.

09:40.318 --> 09:41.798
TALK ABOUT
YOUR BIG NO-NOs.

09:41.972 --> 09:44.018
HEY, GOOD LUCK
WITH THE LITTLE ONE.

09:44.192 --> 09:46.455
THANKS.

09:46.629 --> 09:48.936
HE REALLY SHOULD'VE
KNOWN BETTER.

09:49.110 --> 09:50.285
PIPER,
SNAP OUT OF IT!

09:50.459 --> 09:51.765
THIS
IS CRAZY-MAKING!

09:51.939 --> 09:53.723
WHAT IS?THIS, EVERYTHING!

09:53.897 --> 09:55.943
YOU, THE HAND,

WORLD!

09:56.117 --> 09:57.640

INSANE!

09:57.814 --> 09:59.511
PHOEBE, YOU REALLY
SHOULD NOT SWEAR.

09:59.686 --> 10:01.035
THEY WILL CUT
YOUR TONGUE OUT.

10:01.209 --> 10:03.777
OHH! THIS
IS RIDICULOUS.

10:03.951 --> 10:06.214
OK, PIPER,
YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO ME.

10:06.388 --> 10:08.172
WYATT IS IN DANGER.

10:08.346 --> 10:10.087
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WHAT KIND OF DANGER?

10:10.261 --> 10:12.350
IT'S GIDEON.
HE'S TRYING TO KILL HIM.

10:12.524 --> 10:14.526
[LAUGHING]

10:17.181 --> 10:19.314
IT'S NOT FUNNY!
I'M BEING SERIOUS.

10:19.488 --> 10:20.837
THAT'S RIDICULOUS!
HE'S AN ELDER.

10:21.011 --> 10:22.622
HE COULDN'T HURT A FLY.

10:22.796 --> 10:23.971
[LAUGHING]

10:24.145 --> 10:25.494
WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

10:25.668 --> 10:27.409
OH, DON'T ASK. OHH!

10:27.583 --> 10:29.803
WHOOPSY!
THAT'S NOT GOOD.

10:29.977 --> 10:31.021
WHAT'S NOT GOOD?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

10:31.195 --> 10:32.675
THOSE DARN CONTRACTIONS.

10:32.849 --> 10:34.634
THEY'RE A LOT MORE PAINFUL
THAN THEY SHOULD BE.

10:34.808 --> 10:37.158
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?IT MEANS VISITING HOURS
ARE OVER. BUH-BYE NOW.

10:37.332 --> 10:38.376
NO, WE'RE
NOT LEAVING HER.

10:38.550 --> 10:40.030
OH, I'M SORRY,
BUT RULES ARE RULES.

10:40.204 --> 10:41.858
DID YOU WANT
TO KEEP YOUR LEGS?

10:43.338 --> 10:44.252
WE'LL CALL YOU.

10:44.426 --> 10:45.557
OKEY-DOKEY.

10:45.732 --> 10:46.646
OUCHY!

10:49.736 --> 10:51.476
ARE YOU SURE WE SHOULD LEAVE?
I'M WORRIED ABOUT HER.

10:51.651 --> 10:52.913
WE HAVE TO.
WE CAN'T WAIT
FOR LEO.

10:53.087 --> 10:54.566
WE HAVE TO FIX THIS.

10:54.741 --> 10:56.568
THIS ISN'T THE WORLD
WE WANT CHRIS
TO BE BORN INTO.

10:56.743 --> 10:58.005
OK, BUT HOW?

10:58.179 --> 11:00.964
OK? ESPECIALLY NOW
THAT WE'RE DOWN A SISTER.

11:01.138 --> 11:03.837
MAYBE WE SHOULD HAVE
ANOTHER LITTLE TALK
WITH OURSELVES.

11:10.147 --> 11:12.410
YOU WERE RIGHT.

11:12.584 --> 11:15.196
PIPER'S THE ONLY ONE
OF THE SISTERS AFFECTED.

11:15.370 --> 11:20.070
AND THEREFORE THE ONLY ONE
THAT CAN AFFECT HER SISTERS.

11:20.244 --> 11:21.985
SHE CAN CAST
A SPELL ON THEM,

11:22.159 --> 11:24.422
MAKE THEM THINK
AS SHE DOES

11:24.596 --> 11:27.208
SO THAT THEY
WON'T BE CONCERNED
ABOUT ME EITHER.

11:27.382 --> 11:28.600
AND YOUR THEORY...

11:28.775 --> 11:30.777
IS THAT I'M GOING
TO MAKE HER DO THIS.

11:30.951 --> 11:32.909
HOW, EXACTLY?

11:33.083 --> 11:34.781
BY DOING
WHAT YOU DO BEST,

11:34.955 --> 11:37.609
TAPPING INTO HER FEAR
OF LOSING HER SISTERS.

11:37.784 --> 11:39.655
I DON'T KNOW.

11:39.829 --> 11:43.659
SHE'S OUT IN
CLOUD CUCKOO-LAND
SOMEPLACE.

11:43.833 --> 11:47.184
SHE'S IN A PLACE
WHERE SHE DOESN'T EVEN
FEAR HER OWN AFFLICTION.

11:47.358 --> 11:48.664
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK

11:48.838 --> 11:52.233
SHE'S GONNA FEAR
LOSING A SISTER?

11:52.407 --> 11:54.714
FAMILY MEANS
EVERYTHING TO PIPER,

11:54.888 --> 11:56.803
IN ANY WORLD.

11:56.977 --> 11:58.587
THE SOONER YOU HIT
THAT NERVE,

11:58.761 --> 12:02.243
THE SOONER WE BOTH
GET WHAT WE WANT.

12:10.381 --> 12:11.513
ANYTHING?

12:11.687 --> 12:12.557
YEAH, I THOUGHT
I HAD HIM FOR A SEC,

12:12.732 --> 12:14.385
BUT THEN I LOST HIM.

12:14.559 --> 12:16.648
WELL, KEEP LOOKING.
GIDEON'S BOUND
TO SURFACE AGAIN.

12:16.823 --> 12:19.086
WELL, MAYBE YOU SHOULD
ASK THE OTHER ELDERS
FOR SOME HELP.

12:19.260 --> 12:20.130
NO.

12:20.304 --> 12:22.306
HUH.

12:22.480 --> 12:23.699
TROUBLE IN PARADISE?

12:23.873 --> 12:26.658
LET'S JUST SAY WE'RE
NOT SEEING EYE TO EYE.

12:26.833 --> 12:28.835
WELL, THEN MAYBE
YOU SHOULD...

12:29.009 --> 12:31.446
I DON'T KNOW, QUIT.

12:31.620 --> 12:33.143
LOOK, THE GIRLS ARE GONNA
NEED ANOTHER WHITELIGHTER

12:33.317 --> 12:34.710
THE MOMENT I'M GONE ANYWAY.

12:34.884 --> 12:37.408
THAT'S NOT WHY
YOU WANT ME TO QUIT, CHRIS.

12:37.582 --> 12:39.628
OK, FINE, I ADMIT,

12:39.802 --> 12:41.499
I WOULD LIKE
TO GO BACK TO A FUTURE

12:41.673 --> 12:43.501
WHERE MY PARENTS
ARE STILL TOGETHER,
ALL RIGHT?

12:43.675 --> 12:46.417
IT'S JUST LIKE I SAID
WHEN I WAS MAKING
THE POTION--

12:47.636 --> 12:49.856
THE POTION...WHAT ABOUT THE POTION?

12:50.030 --> 12:51.118
WELL, GIDEON DIDN'T WANT IT
TO WORK, RIGHT?

12:51.292 --> 12:52.684
BUT HE DID WANT US
IN THIS OTHER WORLD,

12:52.859 --> 12:53.990
WHICH MEANS
IT PROBABLY DOES WORK,

12:54.164 --> 12:56.601
WHICH MEANS WE CAN
GET YOU HOME.

12:56.776 --> 12:58.429
NO. I'M NOT GOING BACK.

12:58.603 --> 12:59.866
CHRIS, YOU HAVE TO.

13:00.040 --> 13:01.389
NOT UNTIL I FINISH
WHAT I CAME HERE TO DO,

13:01.563 --> 13:04.479
AND THAT'S TO SAVE WYATT
FROM TUR--

13:04.653 --> 13:05.480
TURNING EVIL.

13:05.654 --> 13:06.786
WHAT?

13:08.004 --> 13:09.223
WELL, WHAT
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS,

13:09.397 --> 13:11.965
IF GIDEON ALWAYS VIEWED
WYATT AS A THREAT,

13:12.139 --> 13:14.010
WHY DID HE TURN HIM EVIL
IN MY FUTURE?

13:14.184 --> 13:16.796
I DON'T THINK
HE DID INTENTIONALLY.

13:16.970 --> 13:19.973
I THINK GIDEON TRIED TO KILL
WYATT IN YOUR FUTURE...

13:21.409 --> 13:22.889
ONLY JUST
LIKE IN THIS TIME,

13:23.063 --> 13:24.325
HE FOUND OUT THAT WYATT
CAN PROTECT HIMSELF.

13:24.499 --> 13:27.676
SO, HE PROBABLY
HAD TO GET HIM AWAY

13:27.850 --> 13:29.199
SO HE COULD FIGURE
OUT HOW TO DO IT.

13:29.373 --> 13:30.548
YOU MEAN KIDNAP HIM.

13:30.722 --> 13:31.811
IMAGINE BEING TAKEN
AWAY FROM US

13:31.985 --> 13:33.203
FOR WEEKS,
MAYBE EVEN MONTHS.

13:33.377 --> 13:35.815
CONSTANTLY FENDING OFF
GIDEON'S ATTACK.

13:37.947 --> 13:39.862
I HAD NO IDEA.

13:40.036 --> 13:42.169
WE'RE GONNA CHANGE
THAT FUTURE, CHRIS...

13:44.693 --> 13:46.695
FOR BOTH OF YOUR SAKES.

13:52.048 --> 13:54.007
[ECHOING] THE POWER OF FOUR
HAS WORKED BEFORE.

13:54.181 --> 13:56.574
[ECHOING] YEP,
BUT THAT WAS WHEN
WE WERE IN THE SAME WORLD.

13:56.748 --> 13:58.881
WE CAN'T EVEN
CONTACT THEM NOW.

13:59.055 --> 14:00.361
THERE MUST'VE BEEN A WAY

14:00.535 --> 14:03.146
THAT GIDEON CONTACTED
HIS EVIL COUNTERPART.

14:03.320 --> 14:04.713
HEY...

14:04.887 --> 14:06.019
DO YOU HEAR AN ECHO?

14:18.858 --> 14:20.598
Both: I KNEW IT!

14:20.772 --> 14:23.036
NICE TO SEE YOU.

14:23.210 --> 14:24.559
SO, IS YOUR WORLD
AS MESSED UP AS OURS?

14:24.733 --> 14:26.735
I'VE NEVER SEEN
EVERYBODY
SO MISERABLE.

14:26.909 --> 14:27.867
IT'S, LIKE, EVERY
LITTLE GOOD THING

14:28.041 --> 14:29.651
THAT HAPPENS...GETS PUNISHED.

14:29.825 --> 14:32.741
LIMBS GET CUT OFF
FOR SAYING GESUNDHEIT.

14:32.915 --> 14:34.482
I NEVER THOUGHT
I'D SAY THIS,

14:34.656 --> 14:36.049
BUT I WOULD KILL
FOR SOME DAYLIGHT
RIGHT NOW.

14:36.223 --> 14:37.920
OH, WE GOT PLENTY
OF IT IN OUR WORLD.

14:39.748 --> 14:41.010

THINK HAPPENED?

14:41.184 --> 14:42.664
I THINK WE DID
TOO MUCH GOOD TOGETHER

14:42.838 --> 14:44.448
WHEN WE WERE TRYING TO GET
GIDEON IN YOUR WORLD.

14:44.622 --> 14:46.059
MY THOUGHTS EXACTLY.

14:46.233 --> 14:48.496
MAYBE WE NEED TO DO SOME
SERIOUS EVIL ON YOUR SIDE

14:48.670 --> 14:49.845
TO SHIFT THE BALANCE BACK.

14:50.019 --> 14:51.934
RIGHT.THE PROBLEM IS,

14:52.108 --> 14:53.718
I DON'T KNOW
IF OUR COLLECTIVE POWERS

14:53.893 --> 14:55.329
WILL WORK WITH US
IN DIFFERENT WORLDS.

14:55.503 --> 14:57.244
WELL, WE BETTER THINK
OF SOMETHING FAST,

14:57.418 --> 15:00.073
BECAUSE GIDEON'S
STILL AFTER WYATT
IN BOTH OF THEM.

15:00.247 --> 15:02.423

OF THREE.

15:02.597 --> 15:05.295
IF WE CAN CAST
A SPELL ON OUR
RESPECTIVE PIPERS...

15:05.469 --> 15:07.080
WE'RE BACK
TO FULL POWER AGAIN.

15:07.254 --> 15:08.646
AND BRING US
TO YOUR SIDE

15:08.820 --> 15:10.605
SO WE COULD SHIFT
THE BALANCE BACK...

15:10.779 --> 15:12.650
AND THEN KICK SOME ASS.

15:12.824 --> 15:15.349
Paiges: I LIKE IT!Phoebes: I LIKE IT!

15:25.707 --> 15:27.622
AT A C-SECTION HERE,

15:27.796 --> 15:29.929
MIGHT BE THE ONLY WAY
TO GET THE BABY
OUT SAFELY.

I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

15:44.987 --> 15:46.946
IT WOULD BE SO SAD

IF YOUR SISTERS
WEREN'T HERE

15:48.730 --> 15:51.037
TO HELP YOU THROUGH
ALL THIS.
