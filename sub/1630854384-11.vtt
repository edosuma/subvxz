WEBVTT

00:01.735 --> 00:03.203
What?!

00:03.203 --> 00:05.905
But I am working on
other resources as we speak.

00:05.905 --> 00:07.974
[Fatima]<i> Previously on Sistas.</i>

00:07.974 --> 00:09.409
[Robin]<i> Okay, I lied.
I can help you.</i>

00:09.409 --> 00:10.577
-Sabrina?
-[Robin]<i> Yes.</i>

00:10.877 --> 00:12.278
And I'm sorry, again.

00:12.278 --> 00:13.446
Just help my friend.

00:13.446 --> 00:16.015
I just do not want you
on my team.

00:16.015 --> 00:17.317
Come on, man.

00:17.317 --> 00:20.053
Well, I certainly don't want
you on my team.

00:20.987 --> 00:22.856
[Preston] Help me know how
to love you.

00:22.856 --> 00:25.592
How to say the right things
that Danni wants to hear.

00:26.126 --> 00:27.394
You do what I say.

00:33.069 --> 00:34.837
Yeah.

00:36.539 --> 00:38.875
"Yeah?"
That's all you have to say?

00:40.376 --> 00:42.145
Robin.

00:42.145 --> 00:43.613
Andi, I called you.

00:44.580 --> 00:46.983
Yeah.
And I didn't answer.

00:46.983 --> 00:48.351
I know.

00:48.351 --> 00:50.486
So I thought I would just come
over here...

00:50.486 --> 00:53.256
When I got here,
he was down in the lobby.

00:53.790 --> 00:55.658
So I decided to invite him up.

00:56.626 --> 01:00.396
You decided to invite him up
to my place?

01:01.531 --> 01:03.399
Yeah, well, he said it was
important.

01:04.967 --> 01:07.603
And you thought it was
a good idea to just come up?

01:07.870 --> 01:09.205
It is important.

01:09.672 --> 01:12.075
Well, it's gotta be important
for him to be up here this late.

01:13.076 --> 01:16.145
This couldn't wait until
the office tomorrow?

01:16.145 --> 01:17.613
Business hours?

01:17.613 --> 01:19.549
-I'm sure it can.
-[Andi] Yeah.

01:20.483 --> 01:22.785
It's about the business
we discussed.

01:24.087 --> 01:25.521
[Gary] And what business
is that?

01:25.988 --> 01:26.856
Um...

01:27.790 --> 01:29.192
Gary...

01:29.192 --> 01:30.793
What?

01:30.793 --> 01:32.862
Man comes over here this late
saying he has business with you,

01:32.862 --> 01:34.630
and I can't find out what
it's about?

01:35.364 --> 01:37.900
It's actually really private.

01:41.838 --> 01:43.673
Okay, then talk.

01:47.443 --> 01:48.478
Could you wait in the bedroom?

01:48.478 --> 01:50.980
Please?

01:51.647 --> 01:53.616
You, you want me to leave?

01:53.916 --> 01:55.818
Please?

01:58.554 --> 02:00.356
Just...
[sighing]

02:00.356 --> 02:02.558
[Andi] For me.
Please.

02:06.329 --> 02:07.463
Okay.

02:09.265 --> 02:12.668
[Andi] It'll only take a minute.

02:17.073 --> 02:18.875
[Robin] I tried to call you.

02:18.875 --> 02:20.409
[Andi] Robin?

02:20.409 --> 02:23.412
I don't have time for
your bullshit tonight.

02:23.412 --> 02:24.647
-Okay?
-All right, listen.

02:24.647 --> 02:26.182
I can get her out
in the morning,

02:26.182 --> 02:27.517
but I need a decision.

02:28.718 --> 02:30.987
Okay?
A decision on what?

02:30.987 --> 02:32.054
On bail.

02:32.488 --> 02:34.423
I can get the judge to
grant bail,

02:34.423 --> 02:35.792
but it's gonna be expensive.

02:36.492 --> 02:38.694
Okay, how much is expensive?
That's nothing.

02:40.129 --> 02:42.165
Listen, I'm not sure,

02:42.431 --> 02:44.000
but the prosecutor said

02:44.000 --> 02:46.002
that it could be
three million in cash.

02:46.803 --> 02:48.905
-What?!
-[Robin] Yeah.

02:49.639 --> 02:52.441
-By the way, that prosecutor...
-Is an asshole!

02:53.609 --> 02:56.412
Three million?!
That's unheard of!

02:57.013 --> 02:59.515
Right, so before
I made it happen,

02:59.515 --> 03:00.716
I needed to know.

03:01.951 --> 03:03.519
Do you have that?

03:06.398 --> 03:08.667
<i>♪ My girls hold me down ♪</i>

03:08.667 --> 03:10.736
<i>♪ When them boys mess around ♪</i>

03:10.736 --> 03:13.105
<i>♪ My love life is a headache ♪</i>

03:13.105 --> 03:15.574
<i>♪ We goin' out tonight ♪</i>

03:15.574 --> 03:17.809
<i>♪ 'Cause I'm lookin' for love ♪</i>

03:25.309 --> 03:26.911
So do you have that much
money available?

03:28.446 --> 03:30.147
Not all of it.

03:31.248 --> 03:32.950
Can you get it?

03:33.484 --> 03:34.485
Not by tomorrow morning.

03:35.186 --> 03:37.688
Well, what do you want me to do?

03:40.291 --> 03:42.059
I have to get her out of there.

03:43.027 --> 03:45.029
I mean, I can try to get it
reduced, but...

03:45.029 --> 03:46.097
[Andi] Please, please...

03:46.097 --> 03:47.865
Andi, Andi, I cannot make
any promises.

03:48.866 --> 03:51.068
Listen, I am...

03:52.903 --> 03:55.239
I'm sorry for just barging into
your home like this.

03:55.239 --> 03:57.141
No, this is important.

03:57.141 --> 03:59.276
This is important.
Thank you.

03:59.276 --> 04:01.045
Well, I'm sorry, again.

04:01.045 --> 04:02.546
-I should leave.
-Robin!

04:03.948 --> 04:05.149
If I...

04:05.149 --> 04:08.753
Can't come up with the money...

04:10.588 --> 04:11.589
Could I borrow it?

04:13.023 --> 04:14.959
From you?

04:14.959 --> 04:17.495
Borrow it?

04:19.196 --> 04:21.632
Could you think about it?

04:23.334 --> 04:24.535
How much do you have?

04:27.738 --> 04:30.107
Half?

04:31.075 --> 04:32.510
I think.

04:35.880 --> 04:38.916
Are you 100% sure
that she's innocent?

04:38.916 --> 04:42.219
I'm 100% sure she would never do
something like this.

04:42.219 --> 04:44.355
Okay, because this a lot of
money to put up if she runs.

04:44.355 --> 04:46.123
She would never do
something like that.

04:48.025 --> 04:50.361
She's one of the best people
I know, trust me.

04:50.361 --> 04:52.163
Well, how would you pay me back?

04:56.133 --> 04:57.468
[stammering]

04:57.468 --> 04:59.603
When we go to court,
they refund bail, right?

05:00.671 --> 05:03.240
-If she shows...
-I will get her to court.

05:03.240 --> 05:04.909
-She will...
-Okay.

05:04.909 --> 05:06.010
Listen.

05:06.010 --> 05:07.611
[Andi] Please...

05:08.245 --> 05:11.215
I will do it based on your word.

05:12.583 --> 05:14.785
-Okay?
-Okay.

05:14.785 --> 05:17.521
All right, I should leave.
Again, I am...

05:17.521 --> 05:19.256
I'm very sorry for
the intrusion.

05:21.358 --> 05:22.760
You did the right thing.

05:23.627 --> 05:25.129
You think I did the right thing,

05:25.129 --> 05:26.797
but I don't think he's gonna
think that.

05:29.166 --> 05:30.634
No, he's not.

05:34.371 --> 05:35.973
Thanks, Robin.

05:35.973 --> 05:37.341
You're welcome.

05:37.341 --> 05:39.210
You have a good night.

05:48.018 --> 05:49.653
[elevator dinging]

05:55.993 --> 05:57.528
Gary?

05:57.528 --> 05:58.863
You can come out now.

05:58.863 --> 06:00.798
-[Gary] Yeah...
-I know you were listening.

06:00.798 --> 06:03.367
[Gary]<i> You could be wrong.</i>

06:03.367 --> 06:04.702
Oh, am I?

06:04.702 --> 06:07.605
[Gary]<i> Yeah.
One second.</i>

06:07.605 --> 06:09.139
Come out here.

06:11.342 --> 06:12.977
Gary...

06:14.745 --> 06:17.982
I follow instructions well.

06:19.083 --> 06:20.651
Very well.

06:21.652 --> 06:23.320
Come here.

06:31.562 --> 06:33.631
-Gary?
-[Gary] Hmm?

06:33.631 --> 06:35.299
Are you sure you don't want to
talk about Robin?

06:39.270 --> 06:40.938
Not at all.

06:41.539 --> 06:43.307
Are you sure?

06:46.477 --> 06:47.845
The man's a non-factor.

06:48.979 --> 06:51.315
-Is that right?
-[Gary] Mm-hm.

06:52.550 --> 06:55.386
So...

06:55.386 --> 06:57.321
Let me get you outta this.

06:57.321 --> 06:59.023
And you can kiss me.

06:59.523 --> 07:00.991
I've been chasin' you
everywhere.

07:00.991 --> 07:02.993
I like it when you chase me.

07:08.599 --> 07:11.735
Come with me.

07:11.735 --> 07:14.171
[Andi] What are you gonna do?

07:14.171 --> 07:17.608
[giggling]

07:28.218 --> 07:29.320
Good morning.

07:30.621 --> 07:32.256
Good morning.

07:33.624 --> 07:35.826
How'd you sleep?

07:36.260 --> 07:38.963
Longer than you, 'cause I heard
you get up and go in there

07:38.963 --> 07:41.732
and put on that makeup
and blow dry that hair.

07:41.732 --> 07:42.600
Looks good, though.

07:42.600 --> 07:44.735
Yeah, thank you.

07:45.603 --> 07:47.605
I slept like
I always do with you.

07:47.605 --> 07:49.373
Oh, yeah?
How's that?

07:50.674 --> 07:52.242
Great.

07:54.812 --> 07:56.880
Did you get some sleep?

07:58.983 --> 08:01.118
-Don't knock the black pussy.
-Don't say that.

08:01.118 --> 08:03.487
-That's my job.
-You can't...

08:03.487 --> 08:05.489
Hey, you named the painting
that.

08:05.489 --> 08:07.958
Listen, I...
Yeah, yeah.

08:07.958 --> 08:09.426
I sleep good when I'm with
you, too.

08:09.727 --> 08:11.862
Yeah, you see?

08:11.862 --> 08:14.832
-Yes, I see.
-That's just another reason...

08:14.832 --> 08:17.267
-To be with me.
-Hush.

08:17.267 --> 08:18.869
It's so early.

08:18.869 --> 08:20.170
Why don't you get out of bed

08:20.170 --> 08:22.106
and put your robe on
like normal people?

08:22.106 --> 08:23.974
What is, what is...
What is this?

08:23.974 --> 08:25.743
Try to leave a mystery.

08:27.277 --> 08:28.312
Really?

08:28.979 --> 08:30.381
-Yeah.
-For who?

08:30.381 --> 08:32.449
-I've seen it.
-I try to give you that...

08:33.283 --> 08:34.418
You know?

08:34.418 --> 08:37.488
You know, once you gave it...
Never mind.

08:37.988 --> 08:39.156
Just, you don't have to do that.

08:39.156 --> 08:42.059
Absence makes the heart
grow fonder.

08:47.731 --> 08:49.133
What?

08:49.500 --> 08:50.968
I gotta get ready for work.

08:51.402 --> 08:53.637
Not tryin' to entice you
so early in the mornin'.

08:53.637 --> 08:55.039
I know.

08:55.305 --> 08:56.874
Okay, well...

08:58.776 --> 09:00.878
You think you can stay here?

09:00.878 --> 09:03.614
You want me to stay here?

09:03.614 --> 09:05.049
Yeah.

09:05.049 --> 09:06.917
It was nice having you here.

09:08.852 --> 09:11.588
Then, yeah.
I can stay.

09:11.588 --> 09:12.690
[Danni] Thank you.

09:12.690 --> 09:14.892
You...

09:14.892 --> 09:17.428
Wanna shower together?

09:17.695 --> 09:19.430
I gotta...

09:19.430 --> 09:20.931
I gotta...
I can't.

09:20.931 --> 09:22.599
'Cause then
I'll never get to work.

09:22.599 --> 09:24.068
Right?
So...

09:24.068 --> 09:26.970
You shouldn't be the only one
knockin' the black pussy.

09:26.970 --> 09:30.107
That's kinda the point.

09:32.042 --> 09:33.744
I'll never get to work, Preston.

09:33.744 --> 09:36.380
That's...

09:36.380 --> 09:38.482
That's the whole reason
for all of this.

09:38.482 --> 09:40.150
Well, you gonna pay the rent?

09:41.919 --> 09:44.221
Didn't I do that before?

09:44.221 --> 09:46.256
Yeah, well,
you gonna pay it again?

09:46.256 --> 09:48.625
No, last time I paid
for three months...

09:48.625 --> 09:50.661
-I was gone in two days.
-[Danni] I walked into that one.

09:50.661 --> 09:53.464
Yeah, yeah.
You did, you did.

09:54.965 --> 09:56.767
Wait, hold on.

09:58.268 --> 10:01.905
You realize that was, like,
the first night...

10:02.773 --> 10:05.075
Since we met that
we didn't have sex?

10:07.010 --> 10:10.147
I mean, don't get me wrong.
It was good, it was.

10:10.647 --> 10:13.484
But...
Different.

10:13.751 --> 10:17.054
Yeah.
Yeah, I...

10:18.122 --> 10:21.492
-I wanted to, but...
-Well, if you wanted to...

10:22.793 --> 10:24.461
Why didn't you?

10:24.461 --> 10:25.829
I just didn't feel like it.

10:27.965 --> 10:29.566
We needed to talk.

10:30.567 --> 10:33.003
Well, we did, but...

10:35.572 --> 10:37.975
What happened in here?

10:42.146 --> 10:45.482
I mean...
Look at this place.

10:45.482 --> 10:49.453
I just did a little light
redecorating. You know?

10:50.788 --> 10:52.055
I see.

10:54.491 --> 10:55.826
Yeah, I...

10:55.826 --> 10:58.395
I think I'm gonna go.

10:58.829 --> 11:01.665
Yeah.
I think I should probably go.

11:02.299 --> 11:04.368
You just...
No, you're not.

11:04.868 --> 11:07.671
No, Danni, I'm leaving.

11:07.938 --> 11:11.041
-I'm gonna go.
-No, you're not.

11:11.441 --> 11:14.278
-I'm goin'.
-No.

11:14.912 --> 11:16.580
Really?
No?

11:16.580 --> 11:18.582
You just said you were stayin'.

11:20.584 --> 11:23.053
Okay.
Fine.

11:23.287 --> 11:24.588
I'll stay.

11:24.588 --> 11:25.923
I gotta use the bathroom.

11:39.736 --> 11:45.242
[shower running]

12:05.829 --> 12:07.598
Good morning.

12:07.598 --> 12:08.765
[Zac] 'Sup?

12:08.765 --> 12:10.801
You're up early.

12:10.801 --> 12:11.802
I got an appointment.

12:11.802 --> 12:14.071
Oh...

12:14.838 --> 12:16.240
I made it this morning.

12:16.573 --> 12:18.175
About?

12:19.643 --> 12:22.079
I ran into Hayden last night.

12:22.079 --> 12:24.581
Where you see that -- at?

12:25.082 --> 12:26.483
The basketball court.

12:27.351 --> 12:28.619
Zac.

12:29.119 --> 12:31.221
-[Zac] What?
-What did you do to him?

12:31.221 --> 12:32.155
Me?

12:32.155 --> 12:34.157
-Yes!
-[Zac] Girl, I'm not you!

12:34.157 --> 12:36.093
Especially with him comin'
after me, I ain't doin' nothin'.

12:36.093 --> 12:38.262
Well, I told you that.

12:38.262 --> 12:41.031
Exactly, but I called Bryce.

12:41.031 --> 12:43.667
-He said he knows somebody, so.
-[Fatima] Okay.

12:43.667 --> 12:46.970
-I'm go meet this attorney.
-Well, that's good.

12:46.970 --> 12:49.006
-Baby?
-Huh?

12:49.006 --> 12:50.240
Do you really think
they gonna come after me,

12:50.240 --> 12:53.010
like, this hard, like...?

12:53.010 --> 12:54.544
Honey, that is a hard yes.

12:54.912 --> 12:56.947
And you won't marry me
because of it?

12:56.947 --> 12:58.415
Look, Zac, I know we're engaged.

12:58.415 --> 13:00.117
But we never talked about
marriage.

13:00.117 --> 13:02.586
Are we engaged?
Because...

13:03.587 --> 13:05.956
You don't wear
your engagement ring to work.

13:08.125 --> 13:10.661
That's because I don't want Andi
to know about it, yet.

13:11.061 --> 13:13.130
Then when?

13:14.364 --> 13:15.966
Babe, will you just trust me?

13:15.966 --> 13:17.367
I do trust you.

13:17.367 --> 13:19.036
Zac, I do want to marry you.

13:19.703 --> 13:21.605
It's just that Andi doesn't need
to know yet.

13:21.605 --> 13:24.408
Well, why?
Can you at least tell me why?

13:24.408 --> 13:26.443
Well, Karen!

13:26.443 --> 13:28.312
I knew this was gonna keep
comin' back.

13:28.312 --> 13:30.180
You still pissed!
And you don't...

13:30.180 --> 13:31.982
You don't feel certain, right?

13:31.982 --> 13:33.817
Zac, no, that's not it.

13:33.817 --> 13:35.218
So then, what is it?

13:35.218 --> 13:37.521
All right, I'm going to
have to tell you this,

13:37.521 --> 13:39.823
or you gonna create your own
story in your head.

13:39.823 --> 13:41.458
Yes, you do know me.

13:41.458 --> 13:43.093
You're about to marry me,
so you should know that.

13:43.093 --> 13:44.461
Okay, continue.

13:44.828 --> 13:46.530
Look, I...
I trust Andi, I do.

13:47.297 --> 13:49.800
But baby, if she tells Karen...

13:49.800 --> 13:52.035
She may get even more upset.

13:52.035 --> 13:54.338
And really come after your ass.

13:55.372 --> 13:58.408
So, let's just
wait 'til we get the results.

13:58.408 --> 14:02.112
And then we can scream it from
the mountaintop, okay?

14:02.112 --> 14:03.613
You sure that's what it is?

14:03.613 --> 14:05.582
Yes, but until then...

14:05.582 --> 14:09.353
I'm just gonna take
my ring off at work.

14:09.353 --> 14:10.887
Fine.

14:10.887 --> 14:14.658
Hey, where is my Zac and what
have you done with him?

14:14.658 --> 14:15.926
What?
I'm right here.

14:15.926 --> 14:19.196
No, where is my man with
all the confidence and swag?

14:19.196 --> 14:21.365
-Like...
-I'm swagged out, look at me!

14:21.365 --> 14:22.899
You see I got a belt buckle
on my shoulder,

14:22.899 --> 14:24.701
I'm swaggy, right?

14:25.569 --> 14:26.903
Yeah.

14:26.903 --> 14:29.106
I just, I got all this bullshit
goin' on, it's like...

14:29.106 --> 14:30.874
My mind is all over the place.

14:30.874 --> 14:32.275
-I can't even lie.
-[Fatima] Zac...

14:32.275 --> 14:36.580
I'm not leaving you, okay?
Not ever.

14:36.580 --> 14:37.681
You promise?

14:37.681 --> 14:39.883
Yes, and you're not
leaving me, either.

14:39.883 --> 14:41.218
You stuck with me.

14:41.218 --> 14:43.453
-I ain't tryin' to go nowhere.
-Okay.

14:43.453 --> 14:44.447
All right.

14:48.918 --> 14:50.286
That was good.

14:50.586 --> 14:51.487
Mm-hm.
See?

14:51.487 --> 14:54.123
One good meal deserves another.

14:54.123 --> 14:56.458
Mm-hm.
Yeah, you can cook all right.

14:56.826 --> 14:58.327
I know I can.

14:58.828 --> 14:59.862
[Aaron] And you see?

14:59.862 --> 15:01.130
See what?

15:01.130 --> 15:03.432
You stayed home last night,

15:03.432 --> 15:05.301
and the world didn't
come to an end.

15:05.935 --> 15:07.002
You right.

15:07.303 --> 15:09.805
But I am going to the salon.

15:10.406 --> 15:11.640
-Karen, come on.
-[Karen] No, I am.

15:11.640 --> 15:14.510
I'm gonna go meet the girls,
and from there,

15:14.510 --> 15:16.245
we gonna go to the doctor.

15:17.179 --> 15:18.247
Okay.

15:18.247 --> 15:20.249
Plus I got to check on 'Brina.

15:20.716 --> 15:21.917
[Aaron] Sabrina?

15:21.917 --> 15:23.252
Long story.

15:24.019 --> 15:25.421
Well, is there
anything I can do?

15:26.288 --> 15:28.324
No.
It's okay.

15:28.991 --> 15:30.326
[Aaron] All right.

15:30.326 --> 15:32.695
Well, I'mma go in
the office for a couple hours.

15:33.262 --> 15:35.564
And then let's come back
a little later.

15:35.564 --> 15:36.765
Sounds good.

15:37.066 --> 15:38.400
Okay.

15:38.400 --> 15:40.836
You're not gonna stay there
all day, are you?

15:40.836 --> 15:42.271
Why?

15:42.271 --> 15:44.573
So you and Pam can tell my mama,
and she can drag me out?

15:45.174 --> 15:46.475
And you know we will.

15:46.475 --> 15:47.877
-I know you will.
-[Aaron] Oh, yeah.

15:47.877 --> 15:49.178
-You're sick.
-[Aaron] Mm.

15:49.178 --> 15:51.113
-Terrible.
-Or just loving.

15:51.113 --> 15:52.581
Whatever, though.

15:52.581 --> 15:54.516
Yeah, okay.

15:54.516 --> 15:57.586
-[Aaron] Yeah.
-Later.

15:58.654 --> 15:59.889
And I love you.

16:04.226 --> 16:06.762
-I love you, too.
-Mm-hm.

16:17.273 --> 16:21.644
[phone ringing]

16:21.644 --> 16:23.312
Hey, girl.

16:23.312 --> 16:24.613
[Karen]<i> Hey.</i>

16:25.581 --> 16:27.316
What's up?

16:27.316 --> 16:29.451
You heard anything about 'Brina?

16:29.451 --> 16:31.253
Yes!
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

16:31.253 --> 16:32.888
I'm so sorry.
I was gonna call.

16:32.888 --> 16:34.990
She gets out soon!

16:34.990 --> 16:36.825
-[Karen]<i> What?
</i>-Yes.

16:36.825 --> 16:38.894
Robin was able to move
some things around, so...

16:38.894 --> 16:40.829
Oh, thank God.

16:40.829 --> 16:42.765
Yeah, tell me about it.

16:42.765 --> 16:44.233
Well, what time is that?

16:44.233 --> 16:46.502
I think she gets out
at around 9:00.

16:47.670 --> 16:50.072
Yeah.
I'ma head there now.

16:50.072 --> 16:52.541
Well, should I go, too?

16:52.541 --> 16:53.676
What time is
your doctor's appointment?

16:53.676 --> 16:56.445
-Noon.
-[Andi]<i> I'll tell you what.</i>

16:56.445 --> 16:58.147
I'll go pick up Danni...

16:58.147 --> 17:00.716
And then we'll go get you
after we're done.

17:00.716 --> 17:02.785
All right, well...
Pick me up at the salon.

17:03.686 --> 17:05.087
You're goin' in?

17:05.087 --> 17:07.022
I can't sit around here all day.

17:07.022 --> 17:08.057
[Andi]<i> Okay.</i>

17:08.057 --> 17:09.425
I'll see you soon.

17:09.425 --> 17:12.661
Okay.
I hope Sabrina's with you.

17:12.661 --> 17:15.331
Well, just be positive.
Okay?

17:15.331 --> 17:17.399
I have hope that she's gonna
get out soon.

17:17.399 --> 17:19.668
Okay, well,
I'll talk to you later.

17:19.668 --> 17:22.304
[Gary] Andi!

17:22.304 --> 17:25.374
Is that Gary?

17:25.374 --> 17:27.276
I'm gonna talk to you later,
girl!

17:27.276 --> 17:28.510
[Karen]<i> Andi...</i>

17:28.510 --> 17:29.945
We gon' talk about this.

17:29.945 --> 17:31.080
[Andi]<i> Bye, girl!</i>

17:31.080 --> 17:33.248
See you later!

17:40.122 --> 17:43.625
That was amazing.

17:44.326 --> 17:45.928
Yeah.
Thanks for an amazing night.

17:45.928 --> 17:48.030
Yeah.

17:49.064 --> 17:50.165
Do you see how cool I was?

17:50.165 --> 17:52.267
About?

17:52.267 --> 17:53.936
Your boss.

17:54.536 --> 17:57.439
Yeah.
What was that about?

17:58.741 --> 18:00.976
Just realized he wasn't
a threat to me.

18:02.411 --> 18:04.346
Mm, and how'd you realize that?

18:06.115 --> 18:08.550
Do you love me?

18:09.151 --> 18:11.253
You know I do.

18:11.253 --> 18:12.721
Okay.

18:13.055 --> 18:16.258
Then he's not a threat.

18:16.258 --> 18:19.661
And you know, he may not be at
your company for much longer.

18:22.131 --> 18:24.466
What does that mean?

18:25.634 --> 18:27.269
Well, you know how
corporate things are

18:27.269 --> 18:28.670
after a hostile takeover.

18:31.140 --> 18:33.542
What does that mean?

18:34.510 --> 18:37.513
It means I need to get
dressed...

18:37.513 --> 18:40.349
'Cause it's going to be
a good, good day.

18:43.252 --> 18:46.255
Okay, I'm gonna get ready
to go, too.

18:46.255 --> 18:47.523
Yeah.

18:47.523 --> 18:49.591
I have a lot of things to
take care of.

18:51.060 --> 18:52.561
Can I come back tonight?

18:54.096 --> 18:55.631
Gary...

18:56.365 --> 18:58.500
Yeah, I'll, I'll see you then.

18:59.501 --> 19:02.504
I will let you know
if you can come back.

19:02.504 --> 19:05.707
Okay. I'll see you
later tonight.

19:07.176 --> 19:08.377
After I let you know!

19:08.377 --> 19:10.612
After you say yes.

19:11.947 --> 19:13.015
-Okay?
-Okay.

19:15.918 --> 19:18.220
You're just gonna let me walk
without giving me a kiss?

19:18.220 --> 19:20.122
I was wondering!

19:23.692 --> 19:25.794
You like when I leave lipstick
on you!

19:27.396 --> 19:28.931
[Gary] I love you!

19:28.931 --> 19:29.965
I love you, too.

19:57.926 --> 19:59.128
Shit.

19:59.695 --> 20:02.331
Ooh, child, she would kill me
if she knew this.

20:02.331 --> 20:03.966
[Karen] Knew what?

20:03.966 --> 20:06.201
Hey, sunshine.

20:06.201 --> 20:08.237
Hey.
What, what happened?

20:08.237 --> 20:09.238
Nothing.

20:09.238 --> 20:10.973
[Karen] Pam.

20:11.240 --> 20:12.341
Pam!

20:12.341 --> 20:13.308
What?
I just cut that on.

20:13.308 --> 20:15.444
Don't you be lyin' to me!

20:15.444 --> 20:17.412
-I didn't, I just...
-[Karen] Okay!

20:17.412 --> 20:19.548
You just, you just, you just...
Left it on.

20:20.449 --> 20:22.084
I swear, I cut that off.

20:22.084 --> 20:23.218
You see?

20:23.785 --> 20:25.921
This is why I can't
trust you to do this, Pam.

20:25.921 --> 20:27.256
I can't.

20:27.890 --> 20:29.958
Are you aware that in
Proverbs...

20:31.793 --> 20:34.796
Something.
It says to forgive and forget.

20:34.796 --> 20:37.032
I don't care what
Proverbs says, okay?

20:37.032 --> 20:38.967
This place could have burned
to the ground.

20:40.302 --> 20:41.336
I know.

20:41.336 --> 20:43.272
This is all I got, Pam!

20:43.272 --> 20:44.907
Just this.

20:45.374 --> 20:46.775
You need a vision board, girl.

20:47.476 --> 20:50.045
-You know what?
-[Pam] Okay, I'm sorry.

20:50.045 --> 20:51.580
Don't do that shit again.

20:51.580 --> 20:54.016
I swear, I'm not tryin'
to stress you out.

20:54.016 --> 20:55.617
Stop doin' it, please.

20:56.018 --> 20:59.321
I'll send you a video of me
cutting everything off.

21:00.022 --> 21:02.925
You should have sent a video
when I asked the first time.

21:02.925 --> 21:03.959
My bad!

21:03.959 --> 21:06.061
God, really.
Why do I put up with you?

21:06.061 --> 21:08.897
Duh, 'cause you know
I got your back.

21:08.897 --> 21:09.765
Oh.

21:09.765 --> 21:12.134
By lettin' my place burn down?

21:12.134 --> 21:15.037
Girl, ain't been nobody's fire
up in here.

21:15.037 --> 21:16.371
Damn, Pam!

21:16.371 --> 21:18.407
Ooh, you know you ain't supposed
to be gettin' that mad.

21:18.407 --> 21:19.942
Well then, stop upsettin' me!

21:19.942 --> 21:21.810
Well, why are you here, anyway?

21:21.810 --> 21:22.911
Checkin' on you, thank God.

21:23.478 --> 21:28.183
Oh, mm-mm.
Don't make me call your mama.

21:29.618 --> 21:30.953
If you call her,

21:30.953 --> 21:33.021
I'mma tell her you left
the curlers on.

21:33.889 --> 21:36.258
-You wouldn't dare.
-Oh, I would.

21:36.258 --> 21:37.359
Try me.

21:37.826 --> 21:40.596
No, 'cause then we both gonna
get in trouble.

21:40.596 --> 21:43.599
-Smart woman.
-Girl, why you really here?

21:43.599 --> 21:44.733
I'm meetin' the girls.

21:44.733 --> 21:47.269
Yes!
You need that.

21:47.970 --> 21:50.606
Well, can I get you anything?

21:51.306 --> 21:52.608
Actually, yes.

21:52.608 --> 21:54.810
You can...
Do your job correctly.

21:54.810 --> 21:56.845
-I got that.
-[Karen] Thank you.

21:56.845 --> 21:59.081
-Just do it.
-All right, easy.

22:01.984 --> 22:03.585
[door closing]

22:08.357 --> 22:11.026
[phone ringing]

22:11.026 --> 22:12.995
-Hey.
-Hey.

22:13.395 --> 22:14.963
I just tried to call Andi.

22:15.530 --> 22:17.065
Yeah, she's in the courtroom.

22:17.566 --> 22:19.368
Oh, where you at?

22:19.368 --> 22:20.602
I'm in the hallway.

22:20.602 --> 22:21.703
They gonna give it to her?

22:21.703 --> 22:23.905
[Danni]<i> I don't know.</i>

22:23.905 --> 22:25.674
Shouldn't they know by now?

22:25.674 --> 22:26.842
It's a courtroom...

22:26.842 --> 22:28.577
It's a closed courtroom
preceding.

22:28.577 --> 22:31.213
Only the lawyers are allowed.

22:31.213 --> 22:32.881
Okay.
Well...

22:32.881 --> 22:35.017
Just keep me posted, okay?

22:35.017 --> 22:37.486
-[Danni]<i> I will.
</i>-All right, thank you.

22:37.486 --> 22:39.321
We'll see you at 12.
Okay?

22:39.321 --> 22:40.322
Okay.
Sounds good.

22:40.322 --> 22:42.591
-Bye.
-[Danni]<i> Bye.</i>

22:46.629 --> 22:48.230
What happened?

22:48.564 --> 22:49.598
We got her bail.

22:49.598 --> 22:51.701
-Thank God.
-[Andi] Yes.

22:52.101 --> 22:53.836
-So...
-Okay.

22:53.836 --> 22:56.372
So now that we got her bail,
we can take her home.

22:56.372 --> 22:57.606
How long?

22:57.606 --> 22:58.908
Robin's working on it,

22:58.908 --> 23:00.676
but it shouldn't be too long
after that.

23:00.676 --> 23:02.678
-Do we need to leave, or...?
-[Andi] No, no, no.

23:02.678 --> 23:05.047
It should be quick.
So we can just wait.

23:06.449 --> 23:07.650
Well...

23:08.751 --> 23:11.721
You have some powerful friends.

23:11.721 --> 23:12.822
I'm glad that you know that now.

23:12.822 --> 23:15.257
I will get her.

23:15.858 --> 23:19.195
And does it matter to you
that she's completely innocent?

23:19.695 --> 23:23.165
Did it matter to you that
my wife was a bitch?

23:24.367 --> 23:27.269
See, language like that is
exactly why we took

23:27.269 --> 23:28.304
all of your money.

23:28.904 --> 23:31.440
I love your arrogance.

23:31.907 --> 23:33.743
What I don't love is that
you don't stick

23:33.743 --> 23:36.212
to the matter at hand.

23:36.746 --> 23:38.781
Sabrina was completely innocent,

23:38.781 --> 23:41.183
and she has nothing to do
with your divorce.

23:41.817 --> 23:43.152
Yeah, I hear you.

23:44.153 --> 23:45.588
Well, thank you.
I have nothing else to say.

23:45.588 --> 23:48.257
Okay.

23:52.695 --> 23:55.031
-He's a asshole!
-Asshole!

23:55.031 --> 23:56.399
-[Andi] Exactly.
-The, the, the...

23:56.399 --> 23:58.968
This gave me husband, not wife.

24:00.669 --> 24:03.639
Okay, she's still being
processed, so.

24:03.639 --> 24:06.042
Let's, let's just wait here.

24:10.046 --> 24:13.115
-I'm so relieved.
-Yeah, we all are.

24:13.115 --> 24:15.017
You know what? I gotta call
Karen. I didn't tell her.

24:15.017 --> 24:17.219
-She wanted me to tell her.
-Oh, no, no, no!

24:17.219 --> 24:18.054
Let's surprise her.

24:18.054 --> 24:19.088
We'll just show up with her.

24:19.088 --> 24:20.423
-That's good.
-That's good.

24:20.423 --> 24:23.726
-That's good.
-But I do have to thank Robin.

24:23.726 --> 24:26.195
Yeah, you do.

24:30.766 --> 24:32.501
Not like that.
Danni!

24:32.501 --> 24:34.637
Sorry, I'm just so nervous.

24:34.637 --> 24:36.405
Oh my gosh.

24:36.405 --> 24:38.441
-Danni?
-Hm?

24:38.941 --> 24:40.109
Can I ask you something
while we wait?

24:40.109 --> 24:42.678
-Ah, shit.
-It's just...

24:42.678 --> 24:44.814
-Okay, okay.
-Thank you.

24:45.781 --> 24:50.052
If you knew someone was
trying to do something,

24:50.820 --> 24:53.722
and you could help
them avoid a mess...

24:54.757 --> 24:58.094
But you received that
information from

24:58.094 --> 25:00.262
another person
very close to you...

25:02.264 --> 25:03.299
What would you do?

25:04.934 --> 25:06.135
Would you tell them?

25:06.535 --> 25:08.337
That's complicated, 'cause
I didn't understand

25:08.337 --> 25:10.039
a word you just said.

25:10.039 --> 25:11.774
Oh, I was trying to be discreet,
and maybe that didn't...

25:11.774 --> 25:15.244
What did Gary do?
That's what it sounds like.

25:15.711 --> 25:17.146
How'd you know?

25:17.146 --> 25:19.048
Just tell me what the boy did.

25:19.048 --> 25:21.984
Unfortunately, I can't say
what it is.

25:21.984 --> 25:25.187
Okay, since only you know
what you're talkin' about,

25:25.187 --> 25:27.389
just do what you already know
you need to do.

25:29.158 --> 25:30.359
Okay, yeah.
You're right.

25:32.294 --> 25:33.229
So go with your gut?

25:33.229 --> 25:36.265
That...
That sounds appropriate.

25:36.265 --> 25:37.766
Go with your gut.

25:39.168 --> 25:40.102
Okay.

25:43.272 --> 25:45.774
-[Danni] You got it?
-Yeah, I got it.

25:45.774 --> 25:47.443
All right, you don't seem sure.

25:47.443 --> 25:49.044
I will be.

25:53.649 --> 25:55.885
-What the hell?!
-Hi.

25:55.885 --> 25:57.720
Why am I here?

25:57.720 --> 25:59.288
You know why you're here.

25:59.288 --> 26:02.358
I do not know why I'm here,
that's why I'm asking you.

26:03.526 --> 26:04.527
Okay...

26:05.461 --> 26:07.396
[Maurice]<i> Why would you rob
a bank?</i>

26:07.396 --> 26:09.398
[Que]<i> Because you and Sabrina
made me do it.</i>

26:09.398 --> 26:10.900
[Maurice]<i> Oh, yeah, sure.</i>

26:10.900 --> 26:15.504
<i>I was the mastermind behind
your dumbass friends</i>

26:15.504 --> 26:16.639
<i>robbin' the bank.</i>

26:16.872 --> 26:18.240
That dirty mother--.

26:18.674 --> 26:20.109
Well, that is your voice.

26:22.077 --> 26:25.347
Yes, but it's clearly a joke.
Anybody can hear that.

26:25.347 --> 26:27.082
That's not what
the jury will think.

26:27.082 --> 26:30.152
Listen, that man is a liar
and a hustler.

26:30.819 --> 26:33.389
And we have you, dead to rights.

26:35.457 --> 26:37.359
I need my lawyer.

26:37.359 --> 26:38.994
Do you have a lawyer?

26:39.295 --> 26:40.362
I will find one.

26:40.663 --> 26:42.164
But, do you have one?

26:42.164 --> 26:44.400
I said I will call one.

26:45.501 --> 26:48.003
And I won't continue to talk to
you until I have.

26:49.004 --> 26:51.173
Okay.
Then I will do the talking.

26:51.707 --> 26:53.375
-Okay, but...
-Oh.

26:53.375 --> 26:55.611
You're talking,
and you want to be quiet.

26:55.611 --> 26:57.012
Here's the deal!

26:57.746 --> 27:00.549
I know you didn't do it.

27:01.217 --> 27:03.786
Well, then why the --
am I here?

27:03.786 --> 27:05.788
Sabrina Hollins did it.

27:06.355 --> 27:08.157
-No, she didn't.
-[John] Yes, she did.

27:09.792 --> 27:11.026
What?

27:11.026 --> 27:12.628
She is who I want.

27:12.628 --> 27:15.130
-Why?
-She needs to be in jail.

27:16.799 --> 27:18.367
What the hell are
you talking about?

27:18.667 --> 27:20.102
You know what a deal is?

27:20.336 --> 27:21.704
Yeah.

27:22.271 --> 27:26.041
You testify against her,
and we will let you walk.

27:26.642 --> 27:27.776
What?

27:27.776 --> 27:29.745
[John] That's all
you have to do.

27:30.079 --> 27:32.181
Well, I won't be doing that,
so next deal!

27:33.782 --> 27:35.050
Come on, Maurice.

27:35.050 --> 27:38.487
Do you want to be in here
for 30 years?

27:38.921 --> 27:41.457
I won't be in here
for any years,

27:41.457 --> 27:43.025
because I am innocent.

27:43.025 --> 27:45.227
Says a lot of men.

27:45.227 --> 27:47.930
Look, I didn't do anything.

27:47.930 --> 27:50.132
Sabrina did not do anything.

27:50.132 --> 27:54.203
Que is the one you need
to be talking to, call him!

27:54.203 --> 27:56.639
We have.
And he gave you up.

27:56.972 --> 27:58.607
If you give her up as
the manager and

27:58.607 --> 27:59.942
mastermind of it all,

27:59.942 --> 28:01.477
you will get
a slap on the wrist.

28:02.878 --> 28:05.481
Sir, I will never do that.

28:08.417 --> 28:10.519
Okay, then this will be
a long stay for you.

28:11.854 --> 28:13.155
You can't do this.

28:13.155 --> 28:14.890
Oh, I can and I have.

28:15.758 --> 28:17.192
You mother--.

28:17.192 --> 28:19.094
[John] That language will
make it worse.

28:19.928 --> 28:22.965
I am never givin'
my girlfriend up.

28:22.965 --> 28:24.166
Do you hear me?

28:25.067 --> 28:28.037
Okay, well...
Enjoy your stay.

28:29.738 --> 28:32.408
[footsteps]

28:32.408 --> 28:35.110
Girl, I mean, we're going to
need to call Karen.

28:36.145 --> 28:38.747
Oh, oh my goodness.
It's almost 11 o'clock.

28:38.747 --> 28:40.549
I don't think we'll make it.

28:40.549 --> 28:41.817
Okay, no, I'll call her.

28:41.817 --> 28:43.652
Okay...

28:45.854 --> 28:47.723
-[Karen]<i> Hey.
</i>-Hey, Karen.

28:47.723 --> 28:48.924
[Andi]<i> Sabrina's getting out!</i>

28:48.924 --> 28:49.892
What?
When?

28:49.892 --> 28:51.760
[Andi]<i> Now.</i>

28:51.760 --> 28:53.329
Oh my God, that's amazin'!

28:53.329 --> 28:54.396
<i>Thank God!</i>

28:54.396 --> 28:56.398
We are waiting on her right now.

28:56.398 --> 28:57.399
Okay, well...

28:58.567 --> 29:00.669
Maybe I should just go to
the doctor, then.

29:01.603 --> 29:04.206
Can you possibly move
your appointment?

29:05.207 --> 29:07.109
I really should make it.

29:07.743 --> 29:09.812
Okay.
I'm so sorry.

29:10.512 --> 29:13.082
We're going to hurry up, though.
As soon as we get word.

29:13.082 --> 29:14.316
[Karen]<i> Okay.</i>

29:14.316 --> 29:16.318
Okay, don't get the results
without us.

29:16.318 --> 29:17.786
Okay, I will,
but try to hurry up.

29:17.786 --> 29:20.222
Okay, we will.

29:20.222 --> 29:21.890
Oh, Sabrina's coming out!

29:21.890 --> 29:24.026
What?
You see her, she's there?

29:24.026 --> 29:25.361
-[Andi] She is, yes.
-[Karen]<i> Oh my God.</i>

29:25.361 --> 29:27.663
<i>-Well, I wanna talk to her!
</i>-Hold on, hold on.

29:30.933 --> 29:32.267
[Sabrina] Hi, ladies.

29:38.707 --> 29:40.609
Oh, Karen wants to talk to you.

29:40.609 --> 29:42.277
Come here, come here.
Come here, come here.

29:45.748 --> 29:47.249
Okay.

29:47.249 --> 29:48.584
Hey.

29:48.584 --> 29:50.152
Hey, 'Brina!

29:50.719 --> 29:51.920
How are you?

29:51.920 --> 29:53.922
Are you okay?

29:53.922 --> 29:54.990
Yeah, I just...
I need to shower.

29:54.990 --> 29:58.060
Okay, well, I wanna see you.

29:58.794 --> 30:01.697
Yeah, just give me a little bit
to get myself together, okay?

30:01.697 --> 30:03.365
Of course, yeah.

30:03.365 --> 30:06.034
I'll stop by as soon as I'm done
with the doctor's.

30:06.034 --> 30:07.703
[Sabrina]<i> Okay,
that sounds good.</i>

30:07.703 --> 30:09.872
Okay. Hey, love you.

30:09.872 --> 30:12.040
I know.
I love you, too.

30:12.040 --> 30:14.610
[Karen]<i> Okay.
Talk to you soon.</i>

30:14.610 --> 30:15.911
Okay.

30:15.911 --> 30:17.946
Okay Karen,
we'll see you in a minute.

30:17.946 --> 30:19.448
-Bye, girl.
-[Karen]<i> All right.</i>

30:20.082 --> 30:21.083
Are you okay?

30:21.083 --> 30:23.185
Andi, thank you.

30:23.185 --> 30:25.187
-Thank you so much.
-Of course!

30:25.187 --> 30:26.555
Of course, of course.
I had to help!

30:29.091 --> 30:31.794
So, what does this of all mean?

30:31.794 --> 30:33.796
Okay, so, you have bail.

30:33.796 --> 30:37.232
And you just let me work
everything else out, okay?

30:38.267 --> 30:39.768
I don't know, Andi.

30:39.768 --> 30:41.170
No, we're gonna work it out.

30:41.670 --> 30:42.971
That prosecutor...

30:42.971 --> 30:44.273
Listen, don't worry about him.

30:44.273 --> 30:46.175
I have his ass, okay?

30:46.175 --> 30:47.342
-She do.
-I do.

30:47.342 --> 30:49.745
-Okay, okay.
-[Andi] Okay, all right.

30:49.745 --> 30:52.581
-It's fine, we...
-We wanted to go see Karen.

30:52.581 --> 30:53.582
Do you wanna...?

30:53.582 --> 30:55.751
I just, let me take
a shower, first.

30:55.751 --> 30:57.519
Mm-hm, mm-hm, mm-hm, okay.

30:57.519 --> 30:59.655
Well then, we will get you home.

30:59.655 --> 31:00.856
Thank you.

31:00.856 --> 31:01.990
-Of course.
-Thank you.

31:01.990 --> 31:03.826
[Andi] Let's go, let's go,
let's go.

31:04.626 --> 31:05.627
Okay.

31:07.730 --> 31:09.098
Yes?

31:09.832 --> 31:11.868
Hey.
Are you Lori?

31:11.868 --> 31:12.969
Yes, I am.

31:12.969 --> 31:16.205
-I'm Zac.
-[Lori] Yes.

31:16.205 --> 31:17.740
-I called this morning.
-Mm-hm.

31:17.740 --> 31:19.175
Have a seat.

31:19.942 --> 31:20.810
It's a nice office.

31:20.810 --> 31:23.012
Thank you.

31:23.012 --> 31:25.815
Excuse me.

31:25.815 --> 31:29.986
So, thank you for taking me
on short notice.

31:29.986 --> 31:30.953
Well, Bryce is a good friend.

31:30.953 --> 31:33.222
Good 'ole Bryce.

31:33.222 --> 31:37.293
So, how can I help you?
You mentioned child support?

31:37.593 --> 31:38.361
Yes.

31:38.361 --> 31:40.530
Okay.
Fill me in.

31:42.231 --> 31:46.135
My ex from three years ago...

31:46.836 --> 31:48.471
Could possibly be havin' my kid.

31:48.471 --> 31:51.140
I don't know, so I gotta find
out what that looks like, and...

31:51.140 --> 31:53.809
I just found out I have
a three year old son

31:53.809 --> 31:55.344
from a one-night stand...

31:55.344 --> 31:56.846
And she's suin' me.

31:57.513 --> 31:59.715
What do you mean, your ex?

32:00.116 --> 32:02.185
It's a complicated situation.

32:02.185 --> 32:04.654
But the kid may or may not
be mine.

32:04.654 --> 32:08.224
And I'm tryin' to see what them
child support payments

32:08.224 --> 32:09.625
are gonna be like if it is.

32:09.625 --> 32:12.695
Okay, so I looked at what
you sent over,

32:12.695 --> 32:14.564
she can actually get you for
quite a bit.

32:14.997 --> 32:17.433
You want the truth?

32:18.067 --> 32:19.502
Yup.

32:20.603 --> 32:23.606
With your income and what you've
shown me with the house,

32:23.606 --> 32:26.209
both of these women are capable
of requesting

32:26.209 --> 32:28.277
50% of everything.

32:28.277 --> 32:30.580
Wait, what?

32:31.047 --> 32:32.782
Yes.

32:34.650 --> 32:36.419
Each?
50 each?

32:36.419 --> 32:38.487
-Yeah.
-[Zac] That, that's a whole.

32:40.323 --> 32:42.558
The math ain't mathin'.
What, what do I get?

32:42.558 --> 32:43.559
Like, they can just do that?

32:43.559 --> 32:45.795
I have seen it happen before.

32:46.095 --> 32:47.663
Even if we wasn't married?

32:48.264 --> 32:51.334
Well, it's called child
support, so...

32:51.934 --> 32:53.469
You gotta be kidding me!

32:53.970 --> 32:56.339
Okay...

32:59.642 --> 33:01.077
What do I do?

33:01.077 --> 33:02.578
Are you friendly with
either of them?

33:04.814 --> 33:06.649
-No.
-[Lori] No.

33:06.649 --> 33:08.217
Well, I was going to
suggest that

33:08.217 --> 33:10.753
you become friendly with them.

33:11.120 --> 33:12.655
Maybe you can make them an offer

33:12.655 --> 33:15.224
so they can't come at you
in a lawsuit?

33:16.659 --> 33:17.994
How friendly?

33:17.994 --> 33:20.296
'Cause bein' friendly is how
I got into this situation.

33:20.296 --> 33:21.430
Know what I'm sayin'?

33:21.430 --> 33:23.733
Something that will avoid
all these costs.

33:24.467 --> 33:27.203
One already started the process.

33:27.870 --> 33:29.305
I'm sorry.

33:29.305 --> 33:31.607
The other, I don't even know if
the baby's mine.

33:31.607 --> 33:34.010
It's hot in here.
You ain't hot?

33:34.277 --> 33:36.012
Whew, I'm hot.

33:36.012 --> 33:37.380
Okay, look.

33:37.380 --> 33:40.316
If they get counsel,
I can talk to them.

33:40.316 --> 33:41.884
We'll see what happens.

33:42.184 --> 33:43.786
I'm here if you need me.

33:44.720 --> 33:45.888
Are you expensive?

33:46.455 --> 33:47.890
Bryce didn't tell you?

33:49.492 --> 33:50.693
No.

33:51.193 --> 33:52.194
I am expensive.

33:52.194 --> 33:54.163
[Zac] Oh, boy.

33:54.163 --> 33:55.264
But for you...

33:55.264 --> 33:57.867
We can work something out.

34:00.403 --> 34:03.105
Thank you so much.
Thank you so much.

34:03.105 --> 34:04.573
Mm-hm, sure.

34:04.573 --> 34:07.977
Call me if you need anything.
You have my number.

34:07.977 --> 34:09.979
Yes, I will.
I will.

34:09.979 --> 34:11.280
Thank you so much, Lori.

34:11.280 --> 34:14.150
-You ain't hot?
-[Lori] No, I'm not.

34:14.150 --> 34:16.218
-It's the money.
-You want some water?

34:16.218 --> 34:19.522
No, I just need some more money.
And condoms.

34:20.056 --> 34:22.091
Take care.

34:22.091 --> 34:23.826
You have a good day.

34:24.093 --> 34:25.428
Right.

34:36.872 --> 34:39.475
[Andi] Do you want some water?
Do you want anything?

34:39.475 --> 34:40.576
-I'm okay.
-Are you sure?

34:40.576 --> 34:42.278
Yeah, I just...
[keys clattering]

34:42.278 --> 34:44.847
I just need to take a shower.

34:44.847 --> 34:46.048
-Okay.
-Just relax.

34:46.048 --> 34:47.316
Okay.

34:47.316 --> 34:49.919
Well, we told Karen we would
hurry up.

34:50.453 --> 34:52.154
Okay, you guys can go.

34:52.855 --> 34:55.658
Well, we'll be back after
her appointment, okay?

34:56.225 --> 34:57.993
-Okay.
-[Andi] Okay.

34:58.527 --> 35:00.629
Okay.
We'll be back.

35:01.364 --> 35:03.299
Stay free, baby.

35:03.299 --> 35:05.368
-Danni!
-That was too soon.

35:05.368 --> 35:07.803
-It was way too soon.
-It's fine.

35:07.803 --> 35:12.775
But let me tell you somethin'.
Don't let them take your mind.

35:12.775 --> 35:14.910
-They can put you in jail...
-Sabrina, you rest.

35:14.910 --> 35:16.545
-But they can't take your mind.
-[Andi] You rest.

35:16.545 --> 35:18.447
We're gonna leave.
We're gonna get out of here.

35:18.447 --> 35:20.449
Get your ass outta here.

35:20.449 --> 35:22.051
All right, Sabrina!

35:22.051 --> 35:23.452
[door closing]

35:26.522 --> 35:32.628
[phone ringing]

35:34.063 --> 35:35.197
Hello?

35:35.197 --> 35:37.700
Oh, thank God.
Are you okay?

35:37.700 --> 35:40.035
Yeah, I'm fine.
I just got out on bail.

35:40.035 --> 35:42.571
Oh, I can't stand that --!

35:42.571 --> 35:44.573
-Who?
-[Calvin]<i> Que.</i>

35:44.573 --> 35:46.509
He's the one who did
this shit to you.

35:47.009 --> 35:48.577
I know.

35:48.911 --> 35:51.013
And he won't leave
the apartment.

35:52.281 --> 35:53.983
Wait, what?

35:53.983 --> 35:55.751
Yeah, he's here now.

35:56.585 --> 35:59.021
-Are you serious?
-[Calvin]<i> Yes.</i>

35:59.021 --> 36:00.423
I'm on my way.

36:00.423 --> 36:01.924
No, no, no, no.
I'm comin' to you.

36:01.924 --> 36:03.459
I said I'm on my way.

36:03.459 --> 36:05.227
Damn it.
All right.

36:05.227 --> 36:06.061
I'm gonna take a shower, first.

36:10.399 --> 36:11.567
--.

36:13.286 --> 36:14.787
Where y'all at?
I'm in the exam room.

36:18.424 --> 36:20.159
Hello.

36:20.159 --> 36:22.161
Hi.

36:22.395 --> 36:24.397
This is pretty high.

36:26.199 --> 36:27.767
You're not gonna sit down?

36:27.767 --> 36:31.204
No, I've been sittin' in that
seat far too long. I'm good.

36:31.204 --> 36:33.673
[Danni] I'll sit.

36:33.973 --> 36:35.641
Doctor come in yet?

36:36.042 --> 36:37.744
Yeah, she did.

36:37.744 --> 36:39.579
[Danni] What'd she say?

36:39.579 --> 36:42.448
Well, I told her to wait for
y'all to get here.

36:42.448 --> 36:45.618
Okay, well...
How are you feeling?

36:48.121 --> 36:50.289
Nervous.

36:50.289 --> 36:51.991
I can understand that.

36:51.991 --> 36:53.760
Yeah, I would be too,
if I didn't know.

36:54.060 --> 36:56.529
Danni.

36:58.264 --> 36:59.465
It's okay.

36:59.465 --> 37:01.033
No, it's not.

37:02.869 --> 37:04.170
How's 'Brina?

37:04.170 --> 37:06.539
We just dropped her off.

37:06.539 --> 37:08.608
Yeah, she's pretty shook up.

37:09.375 --> 37:11.210
I bet she is.

37:11.210 --> 37:13.212
[Danni] She'll be alright.

37:13.212 --> 37:14.514
I hope so.

37:14.514 --> 37:16.048
She will.

37:17.083 --> 37:19.085
Do you think she's gonna
go back to jail?

37:20.086 --> 37:23.489
I'm gonna try my hardest to make
sure that doesn't happen.

37:23.489 --> 37:24.690
-I know you will.
-[Danni] By sleepin' with...

37:24.690 --> 37:26.626
The light-skinned lawyer.

37:27.427 --> 37:28.995
-Danni.
-[Karen] Okay.

37:31.497 --> 37:34.000
-Stop it.
-Just tryin' to make you laugh.

37:34.000 --> 37:36.469
Okay, we're done laughing.
This is not a laughing matter.

37:36.469 --> 37:37.570
Hello.

37:37.570 --> 37:39.672
-[Karen] Hi.
-Hi.

37:39.672 --> 37:41.140
[Karen] Thank you for waitin'
for my friends.

37:41.140 --> 37:42.975
Sure, it's no problem.

37:44.177 --> 37:47.447
So...
Tell us.

37:47.447 --> 37:49.749
-Okay, you ready?
-Yes.

37:49.749 --> 37:52.218
Well, after looking at
your ultrasound,

37:52.218 --> 37:55.188
and according to what you told
me about your period,

37:55.188 --> 37:57.924
it's not exact science,
but we can get pretty close.

37:57.924 --> 38:00.827
It looks like the baby was
conceived on the 12th.

38:04.464 --> 38:05.431
Are you sure?

38:05.431 --> 38:07.066
Yes.

38:10.703 --> 38:13.406
So...
Not the 19th?

38:13.406 --> 38:14.774
No, no.

38:14.774 --> 38:16.909
And as mentioned earlier,
that...

38:18.377 --> 38:21.814
It's not 100%,
but I am pretty certain.

38:23.549 --> 38:24.817
Okay.

38:24.817 --> 38:26.385
So now, are you keeping
your bedrest?

38:26.385 --> 38:28.721
-I am, yeah.
-[Doctor] Good, okay.

38:28.721 --> 38:30.857
Well, your vitals
and of your tests,

38:30.857 --> 38:31.991
they look really great.

38:31.991 --> 38:34.627
So I don't want you to
overdo it,

38:34.627 --> 38:36.996
but you can ease back into
your life now, okay?

38:37.964 --> 38:41.100
Oh, great!
That's, that's great.

38:41.100 --> 38:42.134
[Doctor] Okay.

38:42.134 --> 38:43.803
All right, ladies.
You all take care.

38:43.803 --> 38:44.937
-[Andi] Thank you.
-All right, no problem.

38:52.612 --> 38:54.580
[Andi] Karen?

38:54.580 --> 38:56.349
Yeah?

38:56.349 --> 38:58.718
So?

38:59.252 --> 39:01.921
Who were you with on the 12th?
Zac or Aaron?

39:03.923 --> 39:04.790
Wow.

39:07.126 --> 39:09.529
Karen...

39:20.640 --> 39:23.276
What the hell are
you lookin' at?

39:25.111 --> 39:26.345
You disgust me.

39:26.712 --> 39:29.015
Shut up bitch!
You know I turn you on.

39:30.783 --> 39:32.385
You're disgusting.

39:32.385 --> 39:35.688
Mm-hm.
Your mama, too.

39:35.688 --> 39:37.189
[knocking on door]

39:44.297 --> 39:46.132
[Sabrina] Where is he?

39:46.599 --> 39:48.000
[Que] Hey, Sabrina.

39:49.702 --> 39:51.771
What the hell are
you doing here?

39:52.805 --> 39:54.206
The hell you mean?

39:55.141 --> 39:58.044
I know it was you.
I know you did that.

39:58.044 --> 40:00.580
Why would you lie on me
to the police?

40:00.580 --> 40:02.582
What did I do?
What did I do?

40:02.582 --> 40:05.051
What did you do?!
Are you playing stupid now?!

40:07.219 --> 40:08.854
I ain't say shit.

40:09.622 --> 40:11.524
I'm not playin' with you.

40:11.524 --> 40:13.593
My good friend is in jail
because of you.

40:13.593 --> 40:15.328
Well...

40:15.328 --> 40:17.697
At least he's getting
free meals and a bed.

40:17.697 --> 40:19.966
And you know, he love
men too, so...

40:19.966 --> 40:21.734
You know that -- grateful.

40:23.769 --> 40:28.007
-You are a loser.
-Yeah, I know. Thank you.

40:28.007 --> 40:30.309
What is he doing here, Calvin?

40:30.309 --> 40:31.811
[Calvin] He won't leave.

40:33.212 --> 40:34.580
[Sabrina] Why?!

40:34.580 --> 40:36.949
I tried to put him out,
but he keeps picking the locks.

40:36.949 --> 40:39.285
And I can't go to the landlord,
because neither one of our names

40:39.285 --> 40:40.586
are on the lease.

40:40.586 --> 40:42.321
-[Sabrina] What?!
-[Calvin] What?

40:42.321 --> 40:45.157
Shit, if I leave him here,
he's going to steal everything.

40:45.157 --> 40:47.627
He already sold half of
my father's golf clubs.

40:50.196 --> 40:52.898
This shit good.

40:52.898 --> 40:54.667
You need to get the hell
outta here.

40:54.667 --> 40:55.768
[Que] I ain't goin' nowhere.

40:55.768 --> 40:58.004
You need to get the -- out!

40:59.105 --> 41:01.674
Calvin, you better get
this bitch.

41:01.674 --> 41:03.376
You watch your -- mouth.

41:06.479 --> 41:07.713
I got your bitch!

41:07.713 --> 41:09.148
Oh, shit!

41:12.585 --> 41:17.757
[screaming]

41:20.359 --> 41:21.861
[screaming]

41:21.861 --> 41:23.963
[Sabrina] Calvin,
you're gonna kill him, stop!

41:27.567 --> 41:29.836
I don't want you to go to jail.

41:29.836 --> 41:31.805
[Danni]<i> Next on Sistas.</i>

41:31.805 --> 41:33.173
I am shocked that
they would do this

41:33.173 --> 41:34.841
but it's clear they're
trying to force me out.

41:34.841 --> 41:36.776
He's got me in a chess move
and he knows it.

41:36.776 --> 41:38.845
-Unless...
-What?

41:38.845 --> 41:42.015
Zac, you have officially
been served.

41:42.015 --> 41:45.118
I need the baddest,
gold-diggin' bitch you can find.

41:45.118 --> 41:47.187
<i>Have her come by the office
and ask for Hayden.</i>

41:47.187 --> 41:49.890
All you have to do
is sign this paperwork

41:49.890 --> 41:51.725
and you'll be out of here
in an hour.

41:51.725 --> 41:52.893
Go ahead and sign.

41:55.454 --> 41:59.058

42:25.043 --> 42:26.244
