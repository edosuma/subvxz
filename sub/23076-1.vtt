02:38.840 --> 02:40.558
Dear God!

02:51.000 --> 02:52.558
Not a chance.

02:56.680 --> 02:57.908
And why not?

02:58.000 --> 03:00.036
She's a famous
heartbreaker.

03:00.120 --> 03:01.189
Do you know her?

03:01.280 --> 03:03.510
No,
but I know her brothers.

03:03.600 --> 03:05.909
Don't. Just stop it.
I can't look at you.

03:14.920 --> 03:16.672
She's gorgeous.

03:35.480 --> 03:37.835
Sorry! My fault. Sorry.

03:46.160 --> 03:48.390
So where are we going?

03:48.480 --> 03:49.708
I thought Maidenhead.

03:49.800 --> 03:51.791
I know a rather
jolly pub by the river.

04:11.800 --> 04:14.075
This doesn't look like
a jolly pub by the river.

04:14.160 --> 04:16.594
No, we seem to have
lost our way.

04:16.680 --> 04:18.476
What a surprise.

04:55.440 --> 04:57.096
You can't possibly
marry him, Diana.

04:57.120 --> 04:59.190
He's practically a stranger.

04:59.280 --> 05:01.714
Is he stranger than us,
do you think?

05:01.800 --> 05:03.028
Not much in it?

05:03.160 --> 05:05.116
- Has he got any money at all?
- No.

05:05.240 --> 05:06.960
It's not as if you don't
have other options.

05:07.040 --> 05:09.793
What about that Hugh?
Didn't he have a castle in Scotland?

05:09.880 --> 05:11.598
Mind you, who wants
to live in Scotland?

05:11.680 --> 05:13.216
Oh, do shut up.
She's talking about going

05:13.240 --> 05:14.673
to live in Kenya,
for God's sake.

05:14.760 --> 05:16.432
Don't tell me
to shut up.

05:16.520 --> 05:17.714
Diana?

05:19.480 --> 05:21.440
Please stop going round
and round and concentrate.

05:21.520 --> 05:23.829
This is your future life
we're talking about.

05:23.920 --> 05:25.911
It's your future happiness.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.436
The thing is,
I just know this is it.

06:31.720 --> 06:33.392
You all right?
I'm all right, darling.

06:33.480 --> 06:34.708
Are you all right?

06:34.800 --> 06:37.075
That's the Milima Estate.

06:37.160 --> 06:39.913
More subtle fragrance,
but it hasn't got the depth.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.080
Mmm. And what do you drink?

06:41.160 --> 06:42.229
Oh, I drink Nairobi Chai.

06:42.320 --> 06:43.912
But it's too black
for the home market.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
Oh.

06:47.480 --> 06:51.075
We don't usually get wives on these
buying trips, Mrs. Cavendish.

06:51.160 --> 06:53.196
Oh, well,
it's Robin's business.

06:53.280 --> 06:54.872
I want to know about it.

06:55.640 --> 06:56.640
Oh!

07:01.440 --> 07:04.000
What is it you
actually do out here, Robin?

07:04.400 --> 07:05.753
Oh, um...

07:05.840 --> 07:07.353
Well, I'm a tea broker.

07:07.440 --> 07:12.878
Um, yes, I collect tea,
and then I broke it, and...

07:12.960 --> 07:14.916
Well, it's very skilled work.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.673
And what does Diana do
while you're off "broking"?

07:17.760 --> 07:19.034
Well, she comes along.

07:19.120 --> 07:20.633
My God,
that's almost indecent.

07:20.760 --> 07:23.115
I like it. Really.

07:23.200 --> 07:24.360
God gave men jobs to do

07:24.440 --> 07:26.715
so women could have
a little time to themselves.

07:26.880 --> 07:29.110
I like being with Robin.

07:29.200 --> 07:30.792
He really is quite bearable.

07:30.880 --> 07:32.518
Well,
I can't see it myself.

07:33.200 --> 07:35.430
It's all
a complete mystery to me.

07:36.200 --> 07:39.636
What Colin means is, how on earth
did Robin manage to nab Diana?

07:39.720 --> 07:42.473
Ah! Yes, my God,
we'd all like to know that.

07:42.560 --> 07:44.994
Yes, I don't know.
How did you, darling?

07:48.000 --> 07:49.035
Do you hear that?

07:54.320 --> 07:56.788
What?
I don't hear a thing.

07:56.880 --> 07:58.472
Yes, exactly.

08:00.320 --> 08:02.515
It's like
the dawn of creation.

08:03.800 --> 08:05.552
You need faith to
survive out here.

08:05.640 --> 08:07.471
Oh, how can you
say that, Don?

08:07.560 --> 08:09.312
And you a doctor.

08:09.400 --> 08:11.709
Well, I believe in
the power of the mind.

08:12.520 --> 08:14.988
Did you hear about the
prisoners on Kome Island?

08:15.080 --> 08:16.957
During the Mau Mau rebellion?

08:18.040 --> 08:22.670
There were 60 of them, all
crammed into a small tin hut.

08:22.760 --> 08:24.671
Prison officer
wouldn't let them out.

08:25.200 --> 08:29.876
Mau Mau leader said, "Very well, I
give my men permission to die."

08:31.520 --> 08:33.988
Next morning,
all 60 were dead.

08:36.760 --> 08:37.760
How?

08:38.280 --> 08:39.633
Mind power.

08:39.880 --> 08:40.880
Hmm.

08:40.960 --> 08:43.030
They chose to die.

08:43.120 --> 08:47.511
They turned their faces
to the wall and died.

08:50.960 --> 08:55.750
Well, I think I would have
chosen to live.

08:59.440 --> 09:01.556
Oh, I've got news.
Oh, yeah?

09:01.640 --> 09:03.870
Yes, it's a bit of
a bugger actually.

09:04.960 --> 09:07.155
I'm never going to be
able to have fun again.

09:09.880 --> 09:11.313
Well, what is it?

09:14.120 --> 09:15.917
I'm going to have
a baby.

09:23.320 --> 09:25.231
Somebody's pleased.

09:29.640 --> 09:30.834
Yeah.

09:31.480 --> 09:33.118
Very pleased?

09:36.760 --> 09:39.035
Best news I ever had.

09:39.120 --> 09:42.237
Well, since I proposed
and you said yes.

09:42.320 --> 09:45.232
Well, you didn't propose,
though, did you?

09:45.320 --> 09:47.231
Didn't I?
No.

09:47.320 --> 09:50.676
You said you had to get married
before going out to Africa.

09:50.760 --> 09:52.159
Otherwise, you'd go native.

09:52.240 --> 09:53.753
Yeah, that's right.
Mmm.

09:55.120 --> 09:57.190
You did say yes,
though, didn't you?

09:57.280 --> 09:58.838
Apparently, I did.

10:04.120 --> 10:05.678
Oh, dear.
Oh, dear.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.536
Never, ever have a baby.
It's a blunder, Col.

10:52.560 --> 10:54.710
- Thank you.
- Never.

11:00.840 --> 11:02.990
Robin thrashing Colin again?
No.

11:03.080 --> 11:04.593
No.
No?

11:05.320 --> 11:06.912
Come on.
We're going to be late.

11:09.360 --> 11:11.874
Yes! Game, Robin!

11:11.960 --> 11:13.632
Oh! Well!

11:13.720 --> 11:15.312
Colin!

11:15.400 --> 11:16.920
Well done.

11:18.680 --> 11:20.160
I never thought
I'd see the day.

11:20.280 --> 11:22.840
Well. It might be
our time to break a sweat.

11:22.920 --> 11:24.353
Oh, God, here we go.

11:24.440 --> 11:25.680
I can't quite
believe it.

11:27.760 --> 11:29.318
I can't quite
believe it, either.

11:29.400 --> 11:30.416
Thank you, Victor.
See you at tea.

11:30.440 --> 11:31.839
Lovely job, Victor.

11:31.960 --> 11:33.456
You've been practicing while
I haven't been looking.

11:33.480 --> 11:36.496
I have. It was the first set I think
I've ever had off you in my entire life.

11:36.520 --> 11:37.936
Come on. Fancy another one?
Absolutely not.

11:37.960 --> 11:40.554
I'm gonna quit while I'm
still vaguely standing.

11:41.600 --> 11:43.716
God, I tell you what,
this feels rather good.

11:43.800 --> 11:45.616
Now I know what it's been like
to be you all these years.

11:45.640 --> 11:47.995
Oh, yeah, no.
It is rather lovely, isn't it?

11:48.080 --> 11:49.991
Look at this.
What is going on over here?

11:50.080 --> 11:51.376
Okay,
what are these contraptions?

11:51.400 --> 11:53.391
Mary, you are extraordinary.

11:53.480 --> 11:54.560
Goodness, Katherine.

11:54.600 --> 11:55.616
Oh, Robin will be
a natural, you'll see.

11:55.640 --> 11:56.675
Never seen you like this.

11:56.760 --> 11:57.856
What is this?
What are you doing?

11:57.880 --> 11:59.711
You just imagine
you're jiving.

11:59.800 --> 12:01.000
And what's the purpose
of this?

12:01.040 --> 12:02.760
Just to look foolish?
No, tone up the tummy.

12:02.800 --> 12:04.836
Mary looks rather fantastic.

12:04.920 --> 12:06.353
Move your hips, darling.
That's it.

12:06.440 --> 12:08.396
This is all it is?
Is this the point of it?

12:08.480 --> 12:10.869
You're just kind of
undulating for fun.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.319
You don't want
a flabby tummy.

12:12.400 --> 12:13.992
Without anyone else joining you.

12:14.080 --> 12:15.911
Just solo undulation.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.160
- Look at that.
- That's it.

12:18.560 --> 12:19.560
That's it.

12:28.440 --> 12:29.475
Are you all right?

12:29.600 --> 12:31.511
Yes,
that's too much tennis.

12:31.640 --> 12:34.677
You all right?
Just too much tennis. That's all.

12:34.760 --> 12:36.910
You were rather good.
That's your fault.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.309
Now the crown jester's
going to step in.

12:43.640 --> 12:44.675
Need a drink.

12:44.760 --> 12:45.880
It's all in the legs.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.355
I'll have another go.
Let's have another go.

12:49.480 --> 12:51.471
Go.
Are you all right?

12:52.280 --> 12:53.508
Me? Yes, fine.

12:55.120 --> 12:56.519
What's the plan?
Oh, um...

12:56.600 --> 12:57.953
I've asked Thomas
to run me home

12:58.040 --> 13:00.713
because Don's coming round
to prod me again.

13:00.840 --> 13:04.230
That's good. He may want to give
me a prod while he's at it.

13:04.320 --> 13:06.390
You sure
you're all right?

13:06.480 --> 13:08.710
Yeah, it's the pregnancy,
isn't it?

13:09.600 --> 13:11.320
It's just making my joints ache.
That's all.

13:11.360 --> 13:14.079
Is it?
Oh, poor Robin.

13:14.200 --> 13:15.696
My joints are fine.
It's funny that, isn't it?

13:15.720 --> 13:19.269
That's because I'm bearing most
of the weight in this pregnancy.

13:19.400 --> 13:21.480
Yes, you are. It's true.
Look, will you come with me?

13:22.000 --> 13:24.468
Oh, dear.
No, I have my, well...

13:24.560 --> 13:26.536
I have my meeting tomorrow
first thing in the morning,

13:26.560 --> 13:27.709
so I was going to bunk here.

13:53.360 --> 13:54.759
Colin.

13:56.080 --> 13:57.513
Colin.

14:02.080 --> 14:03.559
Colin.

14:04.520 --> 14:07.114
Colin. Sorry.

14:07.240 --> 14:09.231
Sorry, old chap.
I'm not...

14:09.680 --> 14:11.671
Sorry. I'm not feeling
too good.

14:12.440 --> 14:14.431
Well, you look ghastly.

14:16.960 --> 14:18.951
Arm's giving me some gyp.

14:20.120 --> 14:21.553
Let me help you.

14:21.640 --> 14:23.392
Lift your right arm.

14:26.800 --> 14:28.199
Left arm.

14:30.720 --> 14:32.119
Legs.

14:34.120 --> 14:37.396
I can't move. I can't move.
What's going on?

14:37.520 --> 14:38.669
Get ice now.

14:38.760 --> 14:40.955
I can't breathe.
I can't breathe.

14:41.800 --> 14:43.995
He's losing it! We have to
get him on a respirator!

14:46.520 --> 14:48.829
Robin? We have to get
oxygen into you somehow.

14:48.960 --> 14:50.840
Looks like we're gonna have
to smash our way in.

14:57.200 --> 14:58.474
Don.
Diana.

14:58.560 --> 15:00.551
How is he?
He's stable.

15:01.520 --> 15:03.158
He's just coming round.

15:08.800 --> 15:10.392
Here we are.

15:37.880 --> 15:39.313
Hello, darling.

15:54.840 --> 15:57.877
The air can't reach
the larynx anymore.

15:57.960 --> 15:59.552
That's why he can't talk.

16:03.040 --> 16:04.837
He says,
"Bit of a bugger."

16:08.360 --> 16:12.558
You inhale the polio virus
from droplets in the air.

16:12.640 --> 16:14.631
The same way
you catch a cold.

16:15.600 --> 16:17.113
It passes into
the blood stream,

16:17.680 --> 16:20.319
into the central
nervous system,

16:20.400 --> 16:24.712
and attacks a big group of
cells in the spinal cord.

16:26.080 --> 16:28.230
The result is
you become like a rag doll.

16:30.480 --> 16:32.630
You can't move anything
from the neck down.

16:33.840 --> 16:35.910
Can't even breathe
for yourself.

16:40.560 --> 16:44.678
Right, and, um, how long
will he be like this?

16:51.200 --> 16:53.236
The paralysis
is irreversible.

16:57.840 --> 17:01.037
A good respiration system will
maintain life for a while.

17:03.200 --> 17:04.838
We're talking
a matter of months.

17:42.560 --> 17:44.551
Tell me what we can do.

17:46.880 --> 17:48.791
Do you want to go home?

17:54.560 --> 17:56.551
After the baby's born.

18:00.480 --> 18:02.118
What about Robin?

18:04.120 --> 18:05.519
Him, too.

18:11.280 --> 18:13.157
You do know...

18:20.760 --> 18:24.355
I have seen enough people
paralyzed by polio before.

18:26.480 --> 18:29.517
The mercy of it is
they don't last long.

18:33.200 --> 18:35.191
It's no kind of life, Diana.

20:41.200 --> 20:43.839
Easy, now.
Careful with the respirators.

20:45.160 --> 20:48.118
That's it. Keep slack in the
tubes at all times, okay?

20:51.120 --> 20:53.509
Good. Very gently.
Very close now. Good.

20:55.360 --> 20:58.670
Let me get round.
Lots of slack, gents.

21:28.080 --> 21:29.149
Diana.

21:29.240 --> 21:31.595
Oh, yes.
Mrs. Cavendish.

21:32.880 --> 21:34.518
Yes.

21:34.600 --> 21:38.559
I'm really sorry.
This isn't a good time.

21:39.480 --> 21:41.516
We've had to medicate
your husband.

21:41.600 --> 21:44.910
So perhaps you could
come back tomorrow.

21:45.000 --> 21:48.515
I don't mind if he's asleep.
I'd just like to see him.

21:50.440 --> 21:53.398
I don't think
that's a good idea.

21:54.600 --> 21:57.637
Your husband is going through
a temporary depression.

21:59.400 --> 22:01.391
But I'd still like
to see him.

22:03.200 --> 22:05.919
I'm so sorry. He doesn't
want to see you.

22:10.760 --> 22:12.239
Excuse me.

22:16.840 --> 22:19.035
There we are.
Tid.

22:19.120 --> 22:20.656
I can manage from now on.

22:20.680 --> 22:22.591
It's not fair to
ask you to do this.

22:22.680 --> 22:24.591
Well, I don't see why not.
All right.

22:24.680 --> 22:27.353
I looked after you when you
were a baby, didn't I?

22:30.440 --> 22:33.159
The thing is, we're not
very well off, I'm afraid.

22:34.160 --> 22:37.072
We've got some savings,
but there's not a lot coming in.

22:37.160 --> 22:38.957
Oh, you don't need to
worry about that.

22:39.040 --> 22:40.951
Your family's
my family, really.

22:42.080 --> 22:44.116
It's nice to be back.
Come on.

22:44.200 --> 22:46.919
That's it.
Come on, little man.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.753
Off we go. Come on.

22:58.480 --> 23:00.471
Ma?

23:00.560 --> 23:02.676
Moo?

23:02.800 --> 23:03.994
Me?

23:04.080 --> 23:06.275
Me. He said "me."

23:10.640 --> 23:11.675
Eh.

23:11.760 --> 23:13.910
"Eh." "Get."
Is the first word "get"?

23:15.200 --> 23:16.519
Or "let"?

23:18.800 --> 23:19.800
"Let me lie"?

23:21.720 --> 23:23.756
Well, he is lying.

23:23.880 --> 23:26.997
Sorry, Robin, you must think
we're awful chumps.

23:28.560 --> 23:35.238
Let me die.

23:39.360 --> 23:40.360
"Let me die."

23:43.440 --> 23:44.440
Talking to Robin

23:44.520 --> 23:46.720
was rather like playing one
of those ghastly party games

23:46.760 --> 23:48.751
where you don't know
the rules.

23:48.840 --> 23:51.195
It's very clever of you to get
him to say anything at all.

23:51.280 --> 23:53.271
Well, what he said was...

23:55.840 --> 23:57.831
What he said was,
"Let me die."

24:01.360 --> 24:03.954
Well, we can't, can we?

24:04.040 --> 24:05.576
You mean we can't even
think of such a thing

24:05.600 --> 24:07.079
or we wouldn't know
how to do it?

24:07.160 --> 24:08.229
Both, I suppose.

24:08.320 --> 24:09.496
Well, it makes
no odds, really.

24:09.520 --> 24:12.796
I had a sort of word with the consultant,
and he wouldn't hear of it.

24:12.880 --> 24:14.871
It's not what they do.

24:14.960 --> 24:16.336
It's not a good way
to go, apparently.

24:16.360 --> 24:17.793
It's several minutes
of agony.

24:17.880 --> 24:19.871
No. No, I don't
want that.

24:19.960 --> 24:21.359
No, of course not.

24:24.320 --> 24:26.436
You do have a life,
too, you know.

24:26.520 --> 24:28.556
You are allowed to
think of yourself.

24:32.240 --> 24:34.231
Chin up.
We're doing very well.

24:41.160 --> 24:44.391
Well, Mrs. Cavendish, we do
have some progress to report.

24:44.480 --> 24:45.629
Progress?

24:45.720 --> 24:47.915
We're learning to swallow again.

24:49.080 --> 24:50.308
We are?

24:50.400 --> 24:52.630
It's more significant
than it sounds.

24:52.760 --> 24:56.753
At present, we have an inflated
cuff round our tracheotomy tube

24:56.840 --> 24:59.718
to stop food and drink
going down our windpipe.

25:00.360 --> 25:01.918
If we can swallow again,

25:02.000 --> 25:04.992
the cuff can be removed,
and air can get to the larynx.

25:05.080 --> 25:07.071
Then we'll be able
to talk again.

25:07.920 --> 25:10.309
Might there be
other progress, too?

25:10.400 --> 25:13.278
This is about as good
as it's going to get, I'm afraid.

25:14.240 --> 25:16.231
How are we this morning?

25:18.840 --> 25:21.673
We wish we were dead.
Good, good.

25:21.760 --> 25:23.591
Good morning to you, Paddy.

25:35.400 --> 25:37.391
He couldn't go on
having no name,

25:40.200 --> 25:42.191
so I decided to
call him Jonathan.

25:46.240 --> 25:48.231
I hope that's all right.

25:52.880 --> 25:54.472
He never
even looks at him.

25:56.760 --> 25:58.751
He can't bear to
even look at him.

26:00.160 --> 26:01.559
You don't know that.

26:02.960 --> 26:04.473
Yes, I do.

26:05.560 --> 26:08.996
I do. I know everything
he's thinking.

26:11.160 --> 26:13.993
Every time I come here,
I hope he'll have changed.

26:14.080 --> 26:15.308
Nearly there.

26:15.400 --> 26:17.550
But he can't bear to
look at his own son.

26:17.680 --> 26:19.033
Well done.

26:50.920 --> 26:54.708
An old priest
I knew once, a very holy man,

26:56.040 --> 26:58.190
he used to say,

26:58.280 --> 27:02.114
"Those that God loves most,
He allows to suffer most."

27:04.800 --> 27:06.791
We can't know the mind of God,

27:06.880 --> 27:10.156
but we can be sure
that whatever happens to us

27:11.120 --> 27:13.190
is somehow part of His plan.

27:19.480 --> 27:20.959
I'm sorry. I didn't get that.

27:22.360 --> 27:23.839
Move closer.

27:23.920 --> 27:25.911
Closer. Yes, of course.

27:30.520 --> 27:34.069
Yes, well...
I'll be on my way.

27:38.160 --> 27:41.038
I'm thinking
you're not a believer.

27:42.760 --> 27:44.751
Believer in what?

27:47.240 --> 27:48.798
God's a joke.

27:49.280 --> 27:51.316
Hmm. No, pal.

27:51.440 --> 27:53.431
God's a joker.

27:55.520 --> 27:58.512
Look at the pig's mickey
he's made of you and me.

28:04.000 --> 28:05.991
How do you live like this?

28:07.760 --> 28:10.035
Ah... You get used to it.

28:10.120 --> 28:12.793
What if I don't?

28:12.920 --> 28:15.036
Well, there's always
a way out.

28:15.120 --> 28:16.758
Like Pete there got out.

28:19.440 --> 28:22.034
In his own private box.

28:46.320 --> 28:47.719
Robin.

28:57.640 --> 28:59.119
Robin.

29:10.600 --> 29:11.828
Robin.

29:20.520 --> 29:22.511
Why do you
keep on coming here?

29:25.840 --> 29:27.831
I don't really know.

29:30.480 --> 29:32.471
I'm no use to you.

29:37.200 --> 29:39.350
You really must
leave me here to rot now.

29:43.880 --> 29:45.871
Well, it wouldn't look
very good.

29:49.800 --> 29:52.997
And apparently,
I love you.

29:54.120 --> 29:57.874
You don't love this.
You can't love this.

29:58.880 --> 30:00.598
Apparently, I can.

30:01.360 --> 30:03.351
Well, I don't
want you to.

30:04.800 --> 30:06.791
Don't you understand that?

30:10.560 --> 30:11.879
Makes it harder for me.

30:13.400 --> 30:15.391
Yes, I can see that.

30:18.080 --> 30:21.072
You'd rather just
pack it in, I know.

30:21.680 --> 30:24.069
And bloody machine

30:27.200 --> 30:29.509
that keeps on
breathing for me.

30:31.360 --> 30:32.679
So it looks

30:32.760 --> 30:36.594
as if you're going to have to stick
around for a while, doesn't it?

30:40.080 --> 30:41.559
I'm sorry to say.

30:41.640 --> 30:43.517
I'm not sorry.

30:45.920 --> 30:48.070
I want Jonathan
to know you.

30:49.760 --> 30:54.754
And maybe... Maybe I can make
life a little better for you.

30:57.720 --> 30:59.631
Don't want your duty.

31:02.560 --> 31:03.879
Yes, all right.

31:03.960 --> 31:07.589
All right. All right.
We know all about that.

31:09.360 --> 31:11.828
Everything's as bad
as it could possibly be.

31:13.440 --> 31:15.556
But I can't go on
coming in here

31:15.640 --> 31:18.200
and have you say
that you wish you were dead.

31:20.200 --> 31:23.192
Because you're not dead,
and that's that.

31:26.440 --> 31:27.793
Robin.

31:31.760 --> 31:33.159
Robin.

31:36.800 --> 31:38.376
Come on, there must be
something I can do

31:38.400 --> 31:40.630
to make things
more bearable.

31:47.440 --> 31:49.431
Get me out of here.

31:58.120 --> 32:01.749
I'm afraid it's out of
the question. I'm sorry.

32:01.840 --> 32:03.432
Well,
has anyone ever tried?

32:07.960 --> 32:10.918
No one with your husband's
degree of disability

32:11.000 --> 32:12.558
anywhere in the world

32:12.640 --> 32:14.995
exists outside a hospital.

32:18.160 --> 32:21.232
But I've watched
what the nurses do,

32:21.320 --> 32:23.834
and if we had
a ventilator at home,

32:23.960 --> 32:26.428
I just don't see
why it wouldn't work.

32:29.800 --> 32:31.631
Allow me to explain.

32:31.760 --> 32:36.629
Your husband is only alive because
a machine is breathing for him.

32:36.720 --> 32:39.280
If that machine
should fail,

32:39.360 --> 32:42.352
in under two minutes,
your husband would be dead.

32:44.160 --> 32:46.196
Forgive me
if I speak plainly.

32:47.200 --> 32:49.191
Do I make myself clear?

32:51.920 --> 32:55.674
I'll be sad to go, of course,
after all these years.

32:56.720 --> 33:01.316
But since Muriel died, I can't
seem to get on top of things.

33:01.400 --> 33:02.435
Hmm.

33:02.520 --> 33:06.069
Things can run away
from you, you know.

33:06.160 --> 33:07.388
Yes.

33:08.640 --> 33:10.835
It's a lot of work.
Is the roof sound?

33:12.480 --> 33:14.118
Some of it.

33:14.960 --> 33:17.235
Why are so many of
the windows bricked up?

33:17.320 --> 33:20.073
Ah. Oh, yes,
those are my rooms.

33:22.040 --> 33:26.079
Muriel said it saved such a
lot on the heating bills.

33:26.160 --> 33:27.309
Did she?

33:29.200 --> 33:31.395
Well, it's a lot of work,
but it might do.

33:32.200 --> 33:37.593
The thing is,
I haven't got £12,000,

33:37.680 --> 33:39.830
or anywhere
near that, really.

33:44.280 --> 33:47.829
I'd take 11,
or even 10.

33:48.880 --> 33:50.871
All I can manage is seven.

33:53.960 --> 33:55.951
Seven?
Cash.

33:57.160 --> 33:59.310
And then you'd be
rid of the place forever.

34:00.120 --> 34:01.758
And Muriel.

34:04.840 --> 34:07.479
Yes.
Really?

34:07.560 --> 34:09.232
Yes. Yes.
Oh!

34:13.840 --> 34:15.295
And how are
you this morning, Robin?

34:15.320 --> 34:16.389
Did you sleep well?

34:16.480 --> 34:18.471
You're looking good.

34:20.400 --> 34:22.118
Good morning, darling.

34:22.199 --> 34:23.599
Morning, Margaret.

34:23.679 --> 34:25.033
Almost done,
Mrs. Cavendish.

34:34.280 --> 34:35.632
Is that something
I could do?

34:37.600 --> 34:38.600
I don't see why not.

34:40.040 --> 34:42.031
It's just like
a Hoover, really.

34:43.280 --> 34:44.429
Could I try?

34:47.239 --> 34:48.275
Here.

34:51.000 --> 34:52.000
Just...

34:52.040 --> 34:53.109
Right.

34:54.520 --> 34:56.351
Good.

34:56.480 --> 34:57.913
Oh, no, sorry.

34:58.000 --> 34:59.479
Let me.
Let me take it.

35:03.440 --> 35:06.193
Once I got used to it,
I think I could manage.

35:07.320 --> 35:09.515
Why would you want
to manage, Mrs. Cavendish?

35:11.360 --> 35:13.590
Dr. Khan. Robin and I,

35:13.680 --> 35:16.752
we wanted to ask you a question.
Didn't we, Robin?

35:18.600 --> 35:22.036
Can machines like that ventilator
only work in hospitals?

35:23.000 --> 35:25.275
Well, it's just
a machine, you know.

35:25.360 --> 35:27.510
You plug it in,
and it goes.

35:28.240 --> 35:29.559
Why do you ask?

35:30.800 --> 35:32.631
Robin's going to
leave the hospital.

35:40.520 --> 35:42.750
Do you have any idea
of the risks?

35:42.840 --> 35:45.638
Yes. Yes, I do.

35:45.720 --> 35:47.711
The risk is that
he might die.

35:51.720 --> 35:53.153
Robin.

35:59.480 --> 36:01.675
I either go on living here,

36:05.760 --> 36:08.069
or leave here
and possibly die.

36:09.320 --> 36:10.594
Yes.

36:13.160 --> 36:15.151
Well, what are we
waiting for?

36:19.760 --> 36:21.990
Up, up.
I thought we were going down.

36:22.080 --> 36:25.436
No, lift your end up
so we can get the bed down.

36:25.560 --> 36:26.959
Very heavy.

36:32.600 --> 36:33.953
Left, left.

36:34.040 --> 36:35.519
I am going left.

36:35.600 --> 36:38.160
Sorry. Your right.

36:50.080 --> 36:52.992
So, Robin goes in this bed?

36:53.080 --> 36:54.308
Yeah.

36:54.440 --> 36:57.079
And then Diana's bed
goes next to it?

36:57.160 --> 36:58.559
That's what she wants, yeah.

37:00.160 --> 37:02.469
But surely Robin will have
a nurse when he...

37:02.560 --> 37:04.994
No nurse. Just Diana.

37:05.760 --> 37:08.479
I mean, well...

37:09.840 --> 37:12.274
She can't be with him every
minute of the day and night.

37:12.360 --> 37:13.873
She's got to pee,
hasn't she?

37:14.000 --> 37:15.035
She's got me.

37:18.480 --> 37:22.393
£5 says
you'll never make it.

37:24.440 --> 37:26.431
And what do I get
if I do?

37:27.760 --> 37:30.274
You get £5, you t'ick.

37:33.120 --> 37:34.872
You're on.

37:39.880 --> 37:41.518
Ready?

37:48.160 --> 37:51.311
- So long, chaps. So long.
- Best of luck, Robin.

37:52.800 --> 37:56.156
So long, Paddy.
I'll be back for my fiver.

38:02.400 --> 38:04.470
I'll miss you, pal.

38:31.960 --> 38:33.800
Where do you
think you're going?

38:35.280 --> 38:36.793
We're taking
my husband home.

38:36.880 --> 38:38.916
You don't have my permission.

38:39.000 --> 38:42.310
Is this a prison?
Am I your prisoner?

38:43.200 --> 38:44.679
What do you think
you're doing?

38:45.440 --> 38:47.192
It is the patient's
own wish, sir.

38:47.280 --> 38:49.032
He's fully apprised
of the risks.

38:49.120 --> 38:50.997
Take him back to
the ward at once.

38:51.080 --> 38:53.071
Diana,
call the police.

38:53.160 --> 38:56.072
Tell them I'm being
held against my will.

38:56.160 --> 38:59.550
I'm sorry?
What did you say?

38:59.640 --> 39:03.792
You have no right to...
To keep me in this place.

39:09.440 --> 39:11.431
Of course. Be my guest.

39:12.280 --> 39:14.316
Let's go.
Do as you please.

39:18.440 --> 39:20.431
You'll be dead in two weeks.

39:24.040 --> 39:25.553
Ready?
Yes.

39:27.200 --> 39:28.758
Right, bag going on.

39:30.080 --> 39:31.433
All right.

39:34.280 --> 39:35.315
How's he coping?

39:35.400 --> 39:36.400
So far, so good.

39:36.480 --> 39:38.038
Right, ready to move?

39:38.120 --> 39:39.792
- Lift, lift.
- Got it.

39:40.680 --> 39:41.776
Are you
all right, Diana?

39:41.800 --> 39:43.950
Yes.
Okay, gently put him down.

39:49.640 --> 39:50.959
And up again.

40:08.480 --> 40:11.153
Okay. Okay.

40:12.680 --> 40:15.114
Come on. Let's clear the way.
Clear the way.

40:18.520 --> 40:20.158
One, two, three. Lift.
Here we go.

40:21.560 --> 40:23.336
- Keep him level.
- All right, Robin?

40:23.360 --> 40:24.554
Easy.

40:34.960 --> 40:36.816
- All right, all right. Gently, gently.
- You're clear.

40:36.840 --> 40:39.832
We need to get him on the
bed over there, so turn him round.

40:39.920 --> 40:42.354
All right, all right.
Yeah, just to the left.

40:44.520 --> 40:46.715
Uh... Right, yes, that goes
on that table there,

40:46.840 --> 40:48.720
and the cable needs to be
to the left-hand side.

40:48.800 --> 40:51.189
Just leave it there.
Sorry, darling.

40:51.280 --> 40:52.280
Harry.
No, no, Bengy.

40:52.360 --> 40:53.952
Could you come here?
Bengy, get down.

40:54.040 --> 40:56.190
Bengy.
Bengy, off the bed.

40:56.280 --> 40:57.633
You need to do
what I'm doing.

40:57.720 --> 40:59.278
He'll tell you.
Hold on to the cable.

40:59.360 --> 41:00.634
Got it, got it, got it.

41:00.720 --> 41:02.280
He'll tell you if
you're going too fast.

41:02.320 --> 41:04.276
All right, Col, we need
to get him on the bed.

41:05.720 --> 41:08.029
One, two, three. Lift.

41:08.120 --> 41:09.473
There we go.

41:09.560 --> 41:11.790
Got him.
It's okay. Okay.

41:11.880 --> 41:13.757
Right. Right.

41:14.120 --> 41:15.553
Bengy, off you go.

41:16.040 --> 41:17.758
Just take
your shoes off, Robin.

41:17.840 --> 41:19.910
Is it on?
Right...

41:20.000 --> 41:22.176
We're going to change your tubes
right now, darling. Ready, Harry?

41:22.200 --> 41:23.713
I've got your hand, Robin.

41:25.720 --> 41:26.720
All right.

41:28.520 --> 41:29.839
It's on.

41:32.920 --> 41:34.239
You all right, darling?

41:56.520 --> 41:57.873
Yes, I think I am.

42:01.680 --> 42:03.238
Thank God.

42:05.360 --> 42:06.679
Can't believe
it actually works.

42:06.760 --> 42:08.193
Yes, it works.

42:13.280 --> 42:14.349
Could you get Jonathan?

42:14.440 --> 42:16.078
Oh, yes, of course,
my dear.

42:17.880 --> 42:20.952
So this is it.
Our new home.

42:23.800 --> 42:25.279
How do you feel?

42:28.280 --> 42:29.838
Much better.

42:31.640 --> 42:33.790
Diana, what happens
if there's a power cut?

42:33.880 --> 42:35.518
You work it
with a hand pump.

42:36.880 --> 42:39.030
It's a nifty bit of kit.

42:43.160 --> 42:44.798
Look who's here.

42:46.480 --> 42:47.708
Hello.

42:47.800 --> 42:49.119
There you go.

42:50.480 --> 42:52.038
Oh...

42:52.120 --> 42:53.917
Look, Jonathan.

42:55.240 --> 42:56.639
It's Daddy.

43:04.920 --> 43:06.592
Hello, Jonathan.

43:12.480 --> 43:14.152
Hello, dear boy.

43:18.880 --> 43:20.598
This is Bengy.

44:04.880 --> 44:06.871
Night, darling.

44:09.680 --> 44:11.671
Good night, my love.

44:46.760 --> 44:48.193
Diana.

44:49.280 --> 44:50.713
Diana.

44:51.880 --> 44:54.075
Di. Di.

45:21.280 --> 45:24.397
Had a bit of a bump, darling?
Oh, no.

45:24.480 --> 45:28.473
What's the matter?
Has Mummy not been playing?

45:28.560 --> 45:31.870
Shall we go and find Daddy?
Where's Daddy hiding?

45:31.960 --> 45:35.316
Where's Daddy? He's in there.
Shall we go and find him?

45:35.400 --> 45:38.631
What's that naughty Daddy doing?
Daddy?

45:38.720 --> 45:40.836
Jonathan, Jonathan.

45:40.920 --> 45:42.319
Daddy?

45:44.840 --> 45:46.239
Robin?

45:47.560 --> 45:48.993
Robin?

45:50.440 --> 45:52.078
Oh, my God. Robin?

45:58.120 --> 46:01.510
Robin? Robin? Robin?

46:03.440 --> 46:06.637
Please, please, please.
Robin. Robin.

46:07.960 --> 46:09.598
Oh, my God.

46:11.520 --> 46:13.829
Please. Oh, my God.

46:24.200 --> 46:26.191
That was interesting.

46:26.360 --> 46:27.713
Oh...

46:29.360 --> 46:31.351
Oh, my God.

46:54.080 --> 46:55.308
Ah!

46:55.400 --> 46:57.231
I've saved the best
till last.

46:57.320 --> 47:01.393
This one spent the whole of the
war in my air-raid shelter.

47:01.480 --> 47:02.913
Looks like
a good drop, Teddy.

47:03.000 --> 47:04.149
It is a good drop.

47:04.240 --> 47:06.231
And good wine
deserves good glasses.

47:06.320 --> 47:08.834
This one is for
the lovely Diana.

47:08.920 --> 47:09.920
That's me.

47:10.040 --> 47:11.758
Mary. Katherine.
Bloggs. David.

47:14.920 --> 47:18.151
Biggles.
There we are, darling.

47:18.240 --> 47:19.673
And Tid?

47:19.760 --> 47:21.159
No, no, not for me.

47:21.240 --> 47:22.958
Tid only drinks
Dubonnet.

47:23.040 --> 47:25.315
And only on my birthday.

47:25.400 --> 47:26.480
Oh, I almost forgot.

47:26.520 --> 47:28.670
He's sleeping.
To Jonathan.

47:28.760 --> 47:31.911
Happy birthday,
Jonathan.

47:34.240 --> 47:39.872
Yes, I had been wondering what it
might be like to... To get drunk.

47:41.360 --> 47:43.351
Given that
I'm legless already.

47:43.440 --> 47:47.353
What you have to do with mechanical
devices is stress-test them,

47:47.440 --> 47:49.351
find their
breaking point, so...

47:49.440 --> 47:50.509
It's rather good, Ted.

47:50.600 --> 47:52.113
An interesting
experiment, Teddy.

47:52.240 --> 47:53.355
Robin would die,

47:53.440 --> 47:56.955
but you'd probably be able to
improve your machine probably.

47:57.080 --> 47:59.799
All progress has its price.

48:00.640 --> 48:03.757
It's the power supply that's
usually the weak link.

48:03.840 --> 48:06.354
You know, power can fail.
Power frequently fails.

48:06.440 --> 48:07.839
Oh, do stop it.

48:07.920 --> 48:09.239
I'm only hypothesizing.

48:09.320 --> 48:10.833
He's just doing
his job.

48:10.920 --> 48:12.956
He doesn't have a job.
He's an Oxford professor.

48:13.040 --> 48:15.536
There's nothing to worry about
because it can be worked by hand.

48:15.560 --> 48:17.357
Well, what about
in the night?

48:17.440 --> 48:19.078
Well, I'm here.

48:19.160 --> 48:20.832
But you have to
sleep some time.

48:20.960 --> 48:22.757
No, she doesn't.
She's a machine.

48:23.600 --> 48:26.239
Well, if Robin needs me, he wakes me.
Don't you, darling?

48:26.960 --> 48:29.918
Robin makes a noise.

48:30.000 --> 48:31.149
Like a duck.

48:31.240 --> 48:32.309
That's a chicken, Bloggs.

48:32.400 --> 48:33.958
Can you do
a chicken, Robin?

48:34.040 --> 48:36.076
I hate you so much, Bloggs.

48:39.400 --> 48:40.753
Not much.
Hmm.

48:42.240 --> 48:44.800
Much rather have
a bell or something.

48:47.240 --> 48:48.468
What can you move?

48:55.360 --> 48:57.351
Cover your eyes, everybody.

48:59.680 --> 49:01.591
You can move your head.
Can I?

49:01.680 --> 49:03.398
I've seen you do it.

49:05.800 --> 49:07.279
All right, well, let's...

49:07.360 --> 49:09.351
So move your head.

49:12.960 --> 49:14.800
Oh, yes, I think I can have
some fun with that.

49:14.840 --> 49:16.432
Teddy.
Yeah.

49:27.880 --> 49:30.110
Oh, that's wonderful.

49:30.200 --> 49:32.555
Darling?
Bottle?

49:32.640 --> 49:34.631
Oh, why not? Yes.
Why not?

49:35.560 --> 49:37.073
But listen.
Mmm-hmm?

49:39.360 --> 49:42.716
You know those Marconi
shares that I bought?

49:42.800 --> 49:44.791
Justin's hot tip, yeah?
Mmm-hmm?

49:46.800 --> 49:48.791
They've almost
doubled in price.

49:50.400 --> 49:51.515
Really?

49:51.600 --> 49:52.635
Yeah.

49:52.760 --> 49:55.558
Crikey. Well, I hope Justin
got something out of it.

49:57.080 --> 50:01.073
Oh, yes, well, he gets a
very agreeable sensation of

50:04.240 --> 50:06.834
helping someone far less
fortunate than himself.

50:06.920 --> 50:07.989
Oh.

50:09.080 --> 50:10.593
Poor Robin.

50:12.560 --> 50:14.551
Paralyzed for life.

50:14.880 --> 50:16.438
Oh...

50:16.520 --> 50:17.714
Yes.

50:18.440 --> 50:20.749
And his poor wife.
I hear she's a saint.

50:20.840 --> 50:22.353
She is a saint.

50:22.440 --> 50:23.919
A gorgeous saint.

50:27.280 --> 50:28.315
Ah!

51:04.440 --> 51:06.476
Darling, call Teddy Hall,
would you?

51:08.880 --> 51:10.916
I've just had an idea.

51:53.360 --> 51:55.920
- Robin.
- Oh, bloody hell.

51:56.000 --> 51:58.070
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls,

51:58.160 --> 52:00.196
may I present
the Cavendish chair!

52:00.280 --> 52:01.474
That is amazing.

52:01.560 --> 52:02.754
Hooray!

52:02.840 --> 52:03.875
Roll up, roll up.

52:03.960 --> 52:05.791
There'll be no
stopping you now, old boy.

52:05.880 --> 52:07.632
Not bad, eh?
It looks terrifying.

52:07.720 --> 52:09.278
What if it breaks?

52:09.360 --> 52:10.793
Unbelievable, Teddy.

52:10.880 --> 52:13.917
Left, left, left!

52:14.000 --> 52:15.399
We've lost the dog. Bengy.

52:15.480 --> 52:16.993
Robin, how does it feel?

52:17.080 --> 52:18.638
Bloody marvelous.

52:18.720 --> 52:19.755
Really?

52:19.840 --> 52:21.398
Is the ventilator
a little fast?

52:22.320 --> 52:23.639
Well, maybe a little.

52:23.720 --> 52:25.438
Yeah? Is that better?

52:25.520 --> 52:27.272
Yeah, that's better.

52:28.040 --> 52:29.520
How long does
the battery last, Teddy?

52:29.560 --> 52:31.152
Up to three hours,
we think.

52:31.240 --> 52:32.536
Isn't this a case
where a little more

52:32.560 --> 52:33.760
certainty would
be appropriate?

52:33.840 --> 52:35.432
Well, there's a mains lead
as well.

52:35.520 --> 52:37.829
Teddy, you're a genius.

52:37.920 --> 52:39.816
Well, to be honest, it all
turned out to be pretty basic.

52:39.840 --> 52:42.308
I used a bicycle chain
and Sturmey-Archer gears.

52:42.400 --> 52:44.994
I don't know why
no one's done it before.

52:45.080 --> 52:49.312
I'll tell you why.
Because you're not a doctor.

52:49.400 --> 52:52.392
There's no one to tell you
it can't be done.

53:04.080 --> 53:05.991
Oh, hello, Matron.
Hello, Matron.

53:06.120 --> 53:07.800
Oh, we've got an
appointment with Dr. Khan.

53:09.760 --> 53:12.228
- Dr. Khan.
- Ah, hello, Dr. Khan.

53:12.520 --> 53:13.520
Huh?

53:13.600 --> 53:14.669
Paddy.
Oh.

53:14.760 --> 53:16.079
Robin.

53:16.160 --> 53:18.993
This really is
quite something.

53:19.080 --> 53:20.798
Jammy bastard.

53:21.840 --> 53:23.558
What in God's name
is that?

53:31.880 --> 53:35.589
Did you give permission for this
contraption to be brought into my ward?

53:35.680 --> 53:37.636
Well, actually, sir,
Mr. Cavend...

53:37.720 --> 53:39.472
It's hard enough
for our patients

53:39.560 --> 53:41.198
to accept the conditions
of their lives

53:41.320 --> 53:45.233
without raising false hopes that can
only leave them more dissatisfied.

53:45.320 --> 53:46.673
Now, where you come from,

53:46.760 --> 53:50.514
it may be common practice to
play games with people's lives.

53:50.600 --> 53:52.556
Here it is not.

53:52.640 --> 53:54.710
Is that understood?

53:54.800 --> 53:56.074
Good.

53:59.160 --> 54:01.720
It was lovely to see you,
Dr. Entwistle.

54:02.840 --> 54:06.549
Oh... That man's
a pompous idiot.

54:06.680 --> 54:08.079
You must want to
smack him.

54:08.160 --> 54:10.720
Believe me, I'm used to it.
Well...

54:10.800 --> 54:14.759
You'd think he'd want to get chairs
like this for all his patients.

54:14.840 --> 54:16.990
Well, Paddy, looks like
you owe me a fiver.

54:17.080 --> 54:19.355
Not so quick, pal.

54:19.440 --> 54:22.557
You could drop off
your perch tomorrow.

54:23.440 --> 54:24.759
Aww.

54:24.840 --> 54:26.432
Is it safe, Doctor?

54:26.520 --> 54:28.033
I don't know, Paddy.

54:28.160 --> 54:30.310
I've never seen
anything like this before.

54:30.400 --> 54:32.470
Goes five miles an hour

54:33.760 --> 54:35.990
with a strong wind
behind you.

54:36.080 --> 54:39.914
I'd advise waiting a little while longer.
Test its limits.

54:40.040 --> 54:43.874
Yes, quite right. Let me find
the breaking point for it.

54:43.960 --> 54:46.474
No, we're not going to test
Robin until he breaks.

54:46.560 --> 54:50.838
Well, actually, that's
exactly what we're doing.

54:50.920 --> 54:52.656
You're doing better
than all his other patients.

54:52.680 --> 54:53.874
That's what he said.

54:53.960 --> 54:56.076
Poor old Paddy, though.

54:56.200 --> 54:58.714
I wish we could
somehow break him out, too.

55:03.720 --> 55:05.597
It isn't kind to let
them out like that.

55:05.680 --> 55:07.671
On the street,
where everyone can see.

55:07.760 --> 55:11.514
Believe me, ladies, my distress
is far greater than yours.

56:21.640 --> 56:23.437
Bloggs told me
the other day

56:23.520 --> 56:26.671
that all our friends were convinced
that I'd give up on you.

56:28.600 --> 56:32.434
Apparently, they saw me as
some kind of pampered nitwit.

56:33.920 --> 56:36.559
Well, you were
a pampered nitwit.

56:36.640 --> 56:37.709
Oh, was I?

56:37.800 --> 56:40.314
Well, it didn't stop you
running after me, did it?

56:41.480 --> 56:43.914
Well, no, I've got
nothing against nitwits

56:44.000 --> 56:45.911
as long as they're pretty.

56:46.000 --> 56:48.355
Well, you're stuck
with me now.

56:48.480 --> 56:50.994
Yeah, I suppose I am.
Mmm.

56:53.000 --> 56:56.231
Just think, all those
affairs I could have had.

56:56.480 --> 56:57.480
Oh.

56:57.680 --> 56:59.159
And me.

56:59.240 --> 57:00.719
It's not too late
for you.

57:00.800 --> 57:02.518
Isn't it?

57:02.600 --> 57:05.990
What, and come back and find
you've popped off while I was out?

57:09.520 --> 57:11.750
That would rather spoil
the party, wouldn't it?

57:11.840 --> 57:13.193
Yes, it would.

57:15.920 --> 57:18.150
Hold on.

57:22.200 --> 57:24.191
Look. I found Daddy.

57:25.520 --> 57:28.114
That's Daddy
when he was a soldier.

57:28.200 --> 57:30.236
Was he a soldier?

57:30.320 --> 57:31.514
Yes, he was.

57:35.040 --> 57:39.670
And then this is us
when we were in Africa.

57:39.760 --> 57:42.399
That's where you were born.
And what are those?

57:42.520 --> 57:43.794
Elephants.

57:43.880 --> 57:45.154
They're elephants.

57:45.240 --> 57:47.629
You saw elephants?

57:47.720 --> 57:49.153
Yes, we did.

57:49.240 --> 57:50.958
You're so lucky.

57:51.040 --> 57:52.632
Yes, we were.

57:54.280 --> 57:57.431
Can we go to
Africa one day, Daddy?

58:14.600 --> 58:16.716
I'm so sorry.

58:23.280 --> 58:25.271
Me, too.

58:35.600 --> 58:38.592
Right, I'd better
sort out tea.

58:40.200 --> 58:43.033
Can we go to Africa,
please, Daddy?

58:46.400 --> 58:48.675
Wouldn't that be
an adventure?

58:48.760 --> 58:50.557
I could push you.

58:50.640 --> 58:53.279
Rather a long way
to push, J.

58:53.360 --> 58:55.271
I don't mind.

58:56.560 --> 58:59.074
- Are you clever?
- Yes.

58:59.160 --> 59:01.151
Can you prove it?

59:05.920 --> 59:08.559
Okay, maybe you are.
Do you know what?

59:19.480 --> 59:21.710
Maybe you are strong enough.

59:22.760 --> 59:24.751
Mummy.
Yes?

59:25.800 --> 59:28.473
This chair-pushing business.

59:29.360 --> 59:30.793
Mmm?

59:30.960 --> 59:34.509
Is it quite hard to do
over long distances?

59:34.600 --> 59:37.114
Well, it's harder than a pram,
I can tell you.

59:37.480 --> 59:38.754
Oh...

59:38.840 --> 59:40.034
Jonathan?

59:40.880 --> 59:43.474
We're going to have to do some
thinking about this, aren't we?

59:43.640 --> 59:44.993
Mmm-hmm.

59:52.160 --> 59:54.276
As per your design,
Mr. Cavendish.

59:54.400 --> 59:56.436
Be nice.

59:56.520 --> 59:58.511
Takes up to 300 pounds.

01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:02.873
My God.

01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:07.394
Hydraulic lifting mechanism.

01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:09.994
You won't see that
in a Bedford anywhere else.

01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:12.280
What do you think?

01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:16.792
What is it?

01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:19.231
It's a little dark
in the back.

01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:22.394
I feel rather like
luggage is the only thing.

01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:25.438
I just thought...

01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:28.114
Being as the wheelchair
has to be got in,

01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:30.270
the back seemed...

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.150
Yes. Yes.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.319
Have you sat in the back?

01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:38.356
Me? Well, no.

01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:40.237
But, then I'm not, um...

01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:41.389
I'm not...

01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:42.955
Uh...

01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:44.553
You're not luggage, are you?

01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:49.353
Please don't think I'm not grateful.
I truly am.

01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:54.553
You want to sit in the front?

01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:58.794
I don't think
that's possible, is it?

01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:03.351
I suppose if I took out
the front seat...

01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:55.792
Wait for me!
Wait for me!

01:01:55.880 --> 01:01:56.915
Careful!

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.991
Hi, there, little one.
Ought to be shot.

01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:02.711
Robin's amazing,
isn't he?

01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:04.755
It's not a bore.

01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:06.671
I feel I can
talk to you, Robin.

01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:09.710
Mum, Mum,
I'm going in to bat.

01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:12.030
Oh, are you? Brilliant.
You go get them.

01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:13.576
Good luck, Jonathan.
Go on. Thanks, Mum.

01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:15.795
Lucy walked out
a month ago now.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.150
It's been a long time
coming, I suppose.

01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:21.280
Oh...

01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:25.751
Rory, I'm so sorry.
That's rather rough on you.

01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:29.628
Life's a shitty business,
isn't it?

01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:32.598
There you are, trying
to get on with life,

01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:35.148
and then,
out of nowhere, crack,

01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:37.231
everything comes
tumbling down.

01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:43.832
Rory, grab my drink.
Let's have a toast.

01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:47.798
What are we drinking to?
Hmm?

01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:52.351
New dawns.

01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:57.636
New dawns.

01:02:57.720 --> 01:02:59.199
You've made a real
hash of that ham.

01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:03.034
Rubbish, Bloggs. You did that.
I've done this. Beautifully.

01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:05.953
Do you want it?
Yes. Thank you.

01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:08.031
Look at Robin now.
Look at him.

01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:10.096
- Unbelievable.
- How does he do that?

01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:12.953
Well, he proposed
to me yesterday.

01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:14.189
Of course he did.

01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:16.714
Yeah. And I'm so fond
of him.

01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:18.631
The only girl we've
got is you, Bloggs.

01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:20.472
Oh, do shut up.

01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:22.073
But he's no beauty.

01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:24.080
It's not
just the pain...

01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:26.031
Is he actually ugly?

01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:31.630
Um... Well, yes.

01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:34.075
No, no, no,
that's wonderful.

01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:36.393
Why is that wonderful?

01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:38.994
Well, because good-looking
men are bone idle.

01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:41.275
Ugly men
will get things done.

01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:46.313
So pointless. How do you
get over something like that?

01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:47.958
Yep, you're right.

01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:53.194
Lost in the darkness
and silence, but it hurts...

01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:56.317
And I will get over it.
I know I will get over it,

01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:57.833
but it's just
going to take time,

01:03:57.920 --> 01:03:59.717
and at the moment,
I just need a bit of...

01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:04.829
It's a six!

01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:06.399
Yes! Yes!

01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:08.914
Dad! Dad, did you see that?

01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:13.192
- Well done, Jonathan!
- A six!

01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:16.555
So?

01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:18.912
Mmm?

01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:22.511
Did you enjoy that?

01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:23.749
Well...

01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:27.715
You were surrounded
by admirers.

01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:30.751
Yes, as were you.

01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:33.198
Me?
Yeah.

01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:36.835
Rory Stewart for one.

01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:38.359
Oh, Rory.

01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:43.314
Lucy's really
messed him about.

01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:45.431
Hmm?
Mmm.

01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:48.191
I feel so sorry
for him.

01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:55.237
He says he spends his evenings
alone watching television.

01:04:57.760 --> 01:05:01.992
I suppose he'd like you
to relieve his loneliness.

01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:08.034
Well, I'm not going to.

01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:11.349
You can
if you want to, darling.

01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:14.273
Oh.

01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:19.711
You're giving me
permission, are you?

01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:32.279
I do sometimes
worry that, um,

01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:38.550
you don't have enough fun.

01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:40.631
Don't worry about me.
No?

01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:42.359
Mmm-mmm.

01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:44.113
I'm all right.

01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:46.279
Are you sure?

01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:47.759
I think so.

01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:53.315
Mmm...

01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:55.391
We manage, don't we?

01:05:58.760 --> 01:06:00.751
That's easy for me.

01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:05.995
I just sit here while
you do all the work.

01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:10.071
Good old
selfish Robin.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.958
Oh, I say, Diana.
Run away with me.

01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:19.839
Where?

01:06:23.720 --> 01:06:25.995
Spain.

01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:27.479
Spain?

01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:30.470
We can't. Robin.

01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:36.029
Robin. Oh, you really
mean it, don't you?

01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:38.111
Now how on Earth
do we go to Spain?

01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:39.480
Well, by plane,
of course.

01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:42.956
Darling, how do
we get you on a plane?

01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:12.119
Oh, my God!

01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:21.679
Whoa!

01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:23.920
Are you all right, Jonathan?
Bloggs, are you all right?

01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:01.399
Come on, then,
you start.

01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:03.516
I spy
with my little eye...

01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:04.920
The house
is on the beach,

01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:06.598
and I brought
a long extension lead,

01:08:06.680 --> 01:08:08.671
so in theory you can stay
out all day if you like.

01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:12.829
Did you remember
to pack my parasol?

01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:15.832
Yes, darling, and I also
brought pints of sun cream.

01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:17.911
You're just an angel,
aren't you?

01:08:19.240 --> 01:08:22.676
Darling, we should charge
the chair battery.

01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:24.551
Oh, good idea. Uh...

01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:26.790
- Bloggs.
- Yes?

01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:28.676
Can you see a cable
down there on the floor?

01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:30.055
Sorry. I can't take
my eyes off the road.

01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:31.911
Yes, I can. London.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.798
There's a plug board on the
side of the wheelchair.

01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:37.514
Can you plug that into the
second socket for me?

01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:39.636
Uh, yes, I see it.
Second socket?

01:08:39.760 --> 01:08:40.760
Second socket.

01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:42.795
Yeah.

01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:45.951
Oh, God. Sorry.
Something's...

01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:47.336
- I don't know.
- The ventilator.

01:08:47.359 --> 01:08:48.872
It's burning! Mum!

01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:50.473
What's happened
to the...

01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:53.073
- Robin. Robin.
- I'm really sorry.

01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:55.111
Just pull over. Jonathan,
are you all right?

01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:57.839
- Yes, Mum.
- Get the hand pump.

01:08:57.920 --> 01:08:59.200
We need to open
the door.

01:08:59.319 --> 01:09:01.231
All right,
all right, all right.

01:09:01.319 --> 01:09:02.536
- Bloggs, get Robin's door.
- Stop here.

01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:04.520
I'm stopping.
I'm stopping. I'm stopping...

01:09:10.479 --> 01:09:11.707
Robin.

01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:13.631
Bloggs, the bag.

01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:16.913
Jonathan, are you all right?

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:18.035
Yes, Mum.

01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:19.553
Sorry, Robin.

01:09:20.399 --> 01:09:22.776
Oh, God, I knew something like
this would happen. I just knew it.

01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:23.800
What did I do?

01:09:23.880 --> 01:09:24.915
I don't know.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:26.353
The ventilator's broken.

01:09:26.439 --> 01:09:28.237
Robin, are you all right?
I'm fine. I'm fine.

01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:32.917
Jonathan.

01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:40.557
Do you know
how to fix it?

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:46.000
No.

01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:48.428
No, I don't.

01:09:50.359 --> 01:09:52.669
Sorry, Diana. I just
don't know what I did.

01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:55.352
Neither do I.

01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:06.038
Oh, God.
Do you speak English?

01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:11.711
Just a little.
We need a mechanic.

01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:15.031
No, no, we don't. No, no.
What we need is a telephone.

01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:16.439
A telephone.

01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:19.359
Yes.

01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:25.473
Uh...

01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:30.350
I take for you to Torredembarra
to find for telephone.

01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:31.674
Yes. Yes.
Is okay?

01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:34.228
Yes, yes, yes. Jonathan, could
you get my handbag, darling?

01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:35.878
Thank you, yes.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:37.069
Yes, yes.

01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:40.436
Bloggs, Bloggs, Bloggs, Bloggs.
It's rather fast.

01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:42.551
You don't have to go so fast.
Sorry.

01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:46.030
Don't go so fast.
I'm not a balloon.

01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:48.275
- Bloggs.
- Yeah.

01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:51.272
Can you go with this man,
find a telephone and call Teddy Hall?

01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:52.816
He'll either be at home
or at the workshop.

01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:54.796
That's the Littlemore number.
In England?

01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:57.155
Yes. Just tell him
what's happened,

01:10:57.240 --> 01:10:58.912
and that we'll
wait for him here.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.434
Yeah. We'll wait for him to
fly out from England?

01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:03.431
Yes. Can you just go, please?
Yeah.

01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:06.796
Bloggs, just while
you're out, grab us a...

01:11:07.480 --> 01:11:10.711
Pick up some sausage
and a nice bit of bread.

01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:13.238
And a bottle of red wine.

01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:15.199
Corkscrew.

01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:17.553
Good luck.

01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:23.435
Hola.

01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:24.919
I'm not saying it.

01:11:27.920 --> 01:11:29.911
- I hope you can hear me.
- Sorry!

01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:42.154
Mmm-hmm?

01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:52.391
A rather pleasant
temperature.

01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:58.079
Reminds me of Nairobi.

01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:01.798
You all right there,
Jonathan?

01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:05.276
Yes, I'm fine.
It's quite easy, really.

01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:07.153
Oh?

01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:08.920
You really are doing
brilliantly, darling.

01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:10.029
Truly.
You really are.

01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:12.196
I'll take over in a moment.
I'm okay.

01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:14.189
Really.

01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:22.153
Oh, God. I wonder what it
is they think we're doing.

01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:25.471
Why, we've just gone
on holiday in a lay-by.

01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:27.039
It's perfectly normal.

01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:28.553
Cheers.
Cheers.

01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:30.073
Cheers, darling.

01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:48.269
He say God makes a joke.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:01.592
So we have party.

01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:03.159
Sí. Sí.

01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:07.797
Yeah... Well, that's quite
all right, isn't it?

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:50.991
Do you know
who'd love this?

01:13:56.200 --> 01:13:57.633
Paddy.

01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:30.032
- For heaven's sake.
- Teddy!

01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:31.678
Teddy!
Hello, darling.

01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:33.512
Oh, God.

01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:36.797
You could at least have the decency
to be on the point of death.

01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:38.074
What...

01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:41.758
What the hell is this?

01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:47.070
There. Now,
let's fire her up.

01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:53.120
I'm glad someone's happy.

01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:56.830
God knows how you managed to
make such a balls-up of this.

01:14:56.920 --> 01:14:58.876
My fault, I'm afraid.

01:14:58.960 --> 01:15:02.555
What are you all doing gallivanting
in Spain in the first place?

01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:04.039
It's my fault,
I'm afraid.

01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:08.159
Well, this isn't built for
trans-continental voyages.

01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:10.196
I know, Ted. I'm sorry.

01:15:10.280 --> 01:15:12.714
I wanted to see the sun
rise over the Med.

01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:15.473
It rises over Drayton
St. Leonard's, too, you know.

01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:29.714
Teddy?

01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:32.189
Absolutely rather good
you're here.

01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:35.033
I'm planning
an even greater escape.

01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:37.176
Well, I'm not rescuing
you from anywhere else.

01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:39.475
Oh, it's not
just me this time.

01:15:39.560 --> 01:15:41.949
There's a good few more
that need rescuing.

01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:45.270
Let's get this show
on the road!

01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:47.032
Is that chair breathing?

01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:49.315
Like a sleeping lion.
Glorious.

01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:52.352
Is that Dr. Clement Aitken?
The same.

01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:54.590
Very good, very good.
Teddy! Mind.

01:15:54.680 --> 01:15:56.671
Hello.
This is Teddy Hall.

01:15:57.840 --> 01:15:59.353
Oh, dear, dear, dear.

01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:02.120
I have never, in all my career,
seen anything like this.

01:16:02.160 --> 01:16:04.720
You just made this up?
Well, pretty much, yes.

01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:07.075
Only way to get
anything done.

01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:08.673
I like this man.
Is he a doctor?

01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:12.548
Yes, and he's the Director of the
Disability Research Foundation.

01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:13.640
Which he invented.

01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:14.816
Yes, and made
himself director.

01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:16.976
Well, if nobody else will do it,
you have to do it yourself.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.389
Hello. What's this?

01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:22.119
Oh, I'm having a go
at a Mark II version.

01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:25.715
The trouble with the Mark I is
the battery is pretty poor,

01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:27.438
and the pump's very noisy,

01:16:27.560 --> 01:16:29.278
so I'm having a go
at using a solenoid.

01:16:29.360 --> 01:16:31.157
Fascinating. So what is
the battery life?

01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:33.390
On the Mark II,
about six hours.

01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:37.035
How long have you been living
with this condition?

01:16:38.520 --> 01:16:40.670
Eleven years so far.
Incredible.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:43.718
Well, if these chairs
of yours really work,

01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:45.119
I'm gonna need
a lot of them.

01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:47.509
How many?
Hundreds.

01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:50.558
Oh, well, I've been financing
the work myself up to now.

01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:51.840
It hasn't set me back
too much,

01:16:51.960 --> 01:16:56.272
but if we're to go into production,
we'll need proper funding.

01:16:58.160 --> 01:17:00.799
The Department has
to take into consideration

01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:02.836
the question of
cost-effectiveness.

01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:06.869
The life expectancy
of polio patients

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.355
is less than average,
shall we say.

01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:13.279
I'm sorry. I can't see how
I can, in all fairness,

01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:15.112
make a case for funding.

01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:18.199
I have to follow
the rules.

01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:26.713
Rules are so paralyzing,
aren't they?

01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:31.669
Of course, I do sympathize
with your condition.

01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:33.352
Oh, yes. Likewise.

01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:45.075
Name?

01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:46.798
Lady Jane Neville.

01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:49.113
And good for?

01:17:49.320 --> 01:17:50.719
Uh...

01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:54.949
A thousand at least,
if she's in the mood.

01:17:55.440 --> 01:17:57.829
Right. So are we
"plucky" or "pitiful"?

01:17:57.920 --> 01:17:59.512
I think
definitely "plucky."

01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:03.798
These old dowagers
are tough as nails.

01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:07.431
Why does he make
that funny noise?

01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:11.830
Well, that's
the wheelchair.

01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:13.592
It does his breathing
for him.

01:18:14.560 --> 01:18:16.835
Are you quite sure it's
safe for you to be out?

01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:20.911
Seems to have worked
so far.

01:18:21.640 --> 01:18:25.315
And what exactly is it
you want from me?

01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:29.190
Well, we want more
of these chairs.

01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:31.350
Yes, for people
like Robin.

01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:33.351
At £200 a chair.

01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:35.056
Yes, which really
is excellent value.

01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:36.149
- Isn't it?
- Well...

01:18:36.240 --> 01:18:38.879
It would be five
for £1,000.

01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:40.871
£1,000?

01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:43.076
Well, 10 for £2,000.

01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:45.515
£2,000?

01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:48.831
You see, we knew
we could count on you.

01:18:48.920 --> 01:18:50.273
Because you're
so generous.

01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:51.634
Yes.

01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:57.592
I don't usually find it difficult
to say no to spongers.

01:18:58.200 --> 01:19:00.555
But with you there,

01:19:00.640 --> 01:19:03.200
wheezing away in front of me,

01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:06.511
I suppose
I shall have to pay up.

01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:10.435
So very kind of you.
So very kind.

01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:11.669
So kind.

01:19:18.760 --> 01:19:20.751
This is bloody marvelous.

01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:22.159
Aww.

01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:24.072
Do you feel safe?

01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:26.515
I feel bloody terrified.
Ah...

01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:49.872
Hello, everyone.

01:19:59.240 --> 01:20:01.310
My name is
Dr. Clement Aitken.

01:20:01.440 --> 01:20:04.318
I'm the Director of the
Disability Research Foundation.

01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:05.958
In this country,

01:20:06.040 --> 01:20:09.476
there are hundreds of
severely disabled patients

01:20:09.560 --> 01:20:13.519
currently living their entire
lives in hospital beds.

01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:15.670
Worldwide,
there are thousands.

01:20:15.760 --> 01:20:17.512
Do you think they like that?

01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:21.033
If you want to get out,
give me a shout!

01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:26.873
How many
thousands worldwide?

01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:28.552
Oh, tens of thousands,
maybe more.

01:20:29.280 --> 01:20:32.158
No one's ever believed it's
possible to live as you do.

01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:33.832
Well, we should show them.

01:20:33.920 --> 01:20:35.956
What do you want now,
Robin, a world tour?

01:20:36.040 --> 01:20:39.476
Well, there is a European
conference coming up in Germany

01:20:39.560 --> 01:20:41.516
for severely disabled living.

01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:43.989
All the so-called
key experts will be there.

01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:47.954
Oh my giddy aunt!
If only they could see you...

01:21:03.240 --> 01:21:06.198
I think he should be
in hospital. No?

01:21:06.280 --> 01:21:08.271
You're quite right. No.

01:21:09.160 --> 01:21:10.536
You did check
we'd be able to fit

01:21:10.560 --> 01:21:11.936
the wheelchair in,
didn't you, Bloggs?

01:21:11.960 --> 01:21:14.554
Yes, of course, I did.
What do you take me for?

01:21:14.680 --> 01:21:16.591
Thank God for that.
I know.

01:21:16.680 --> 01:21:19.240
I never thought we'd actually make it...
Oh, sorry.

01:21:19.320 --> 01:21:20.616
Oh, sorry.
No, it was probably my fault.

01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:22.016
Pull out, pull out.
Let's pull out, that's it.

01:21:22.040 --> 01:21:23.240
Straight,
straight, straight...

01:21:23.320 --> 01:21:27.108
- Straighten it up. In you go.
- Oh!

01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:29.416
You're not gonna do it.
That's not gonna go through.

01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:31.715
Right.
Whose fault's this, then?

01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:33.256
I think we're
going to struggle here.

01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:35.919
Sorry, I didn't know I was
supposed to measure the doors.

01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:38.136
It's the wheels
that are the problem.

01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:39.456
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
Good idea.

01:21:39.480 --> 01:21:40.629
Drag him back.

01:21:40.720 --> 01:21:42.711
- Listen, listen, listen.
- What?

01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:45.109
We're gonna have to take
the inner door frame off.

01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:46.600
Oh, well done, Clem.

01:21:46.640 --> 01:21:47.840
Clem's done it,
Clem's done it.

01:21:50.960 --> 01:21:51.960
Clem's bloody done it.

01:21:52.040 --> 01:21:53.360
Clem,
that is looking good.

01:21:57.200 --> 01:21:58.519
Quick. Go, go.

01:21:58.640 --> 01:22:00.296
Get him in,
get him in, get him in.

01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:01.514
Sorry.

01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:03.029
Go on.

01:22:03.160 --> 01:22:05.151
Brilliant.

01:22:27.200 --> 01:22:28.880
I want you
to see this, Robin.

01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:31.789
Let me go in first.

01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:33.916
You may give them
something of a shock.

01:22:38.680 --> 01:22:40.272
Dr. Aitken?
Yes.

01:22:40.360 --> 01:22:41.634
It's an honor.

01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:43.517
Erik Langdorf.
I'm the Director.

01:22:43.640 --> 01:22:45.710
Aha! My associates.

01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:50.478
I have heard so much about your
care for the severely disabled.

01:22:50.560 --> 01:22:51.675
This hospital is famous.

01:22:53.160 --> 01:22:54.354
Please.

01:23:20.120 --> 01:23:23.430
Such excellent
modern machinery.

01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:26.791
And everything so clean.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:07.991
The chair has a respirator?

01:24:08.080 --> 01:24:09.798
Mmm-hmm.

01:24:21.480 --> 01:24:23.675
Sorry,
but he must leave.

01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:25.751
Of course.
How stupid of me.

01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:27.068
Please understand.

01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:30.232
We are Department of the
Bundesministerium des Innern.

01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:31.673
If anything were to happen...

01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:33.034
The Ministry of
the Interior?

01:24:33.120 --> 01:24:34.997
Yes.
Like our Home Office?

01:24:35.640 --> 01:24:37.119
Yes.

01:24:37.200 --> 01:24:40.112
Don't they run
the prisons, too?

01:24:40.640 --> 01:24:42.471
I believe so, yes.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.309
Thank you so much,
Dr. Langdorf,

01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:48.197
for giving us so much
of your time.

01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:08.553
May I begin by noting
an interesting fact.

01:25:10.520 --> 01:25:11.794
At this conference

01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:16.158
on Managing The Lives
Of The Severely Disabled,

01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:20.519
there are no
disabled people present.

01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:26.590
Dr. Aitken, forgive me,

01:25:26.680 --> 01:25:31.674
but the severely disabled
are on life-support machines.

01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:33.796
So how could
they be present?

01:25:37.040 --> 01:25:41.989
Well, allow me to introduce
Mr. Robin Cavendish.

01:25:52.040 --> 01:25:53.314
All right...

01:25:55.840 --> 01:25:58.121
If I put that there, is it going to work?
Yeah, well done.

01:26:02.360 --> 01:26:05.875
Robin, you have a question
to ask our hosts.

01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:07.393
Yes, I do.

01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:12.911
Why do you keep your
disabled people in prisons?

01:26:13.720 --> 01:26:15.233
In prisons?

01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:17.916
No. No.

01:26:18.480 --> 01:26:20.357
We have some of
the finest facilities

01:26:20.440 --> 01:26:21.998
in the world for
the severely disabled.

01:26:22.080 --> 01:26:24.674
I know, but they're
run by prison guards.

01:26:24.760 --> 01:26:26.193
No, not at all.

01:26:26.280 --> 01:26:29.636
Well, patients are kept
out of sight.

01:26:31.800 --> 01:26:36.032
Not treated as part
of healthy society.

01:26:36.120 --> 01:26:37.872
I must ask
that you withdraw that.

01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:41.157
Mr. Cavendish doesn't mean
to cause offense.

01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:44.516
He's merely suggesting
that the severely disabled

01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:47.194
can be better integrated
into society.

01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:50.989
Absolutely. I can see
that you all care

01:26:51.640 --> 01:26:55.758
very deeply about your disabled people.
I see that.

01:26:57.840 --> 01:27:00.274
But let me ask you,
when you look at me,

01:27:03.440 --> 01:27:05.351
what is it that you see?

01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:10.153
Do you see a creature

01:27:11.800 --> 01:27:13.836
that's barely alive?

01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:22.679
Or do you see a man
that's escaped the confines

01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:26.629
of the hospital walls?

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.468
Now, I have a machine

01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:37.710
under this very seat
that breathes for me.

01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:46.037
And at home, I have a
ventilator right by my bed.

01:27:50.680 --> 01:27:53.319
I also have a remarkable
group of friends.

01:27:55.880 --> 01:27:58.633
And, most vitally,
I have my wife.

01:28:00.040 --> 01:28:03.157
But, as you see,
I can do nothing for myself.

01:28:06.880 --> 01:28:08.871
And yet here I am.

01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:13.880
Now, when I first became
paralyzed, I wanted to die.

01:28:15.240 --> 01:28:17.231
Yeah, I wanted to die.
I did.

01:28:19.320 --> 01:28:21.311
But my wife wouldn't let me.

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.195
She told me I had to live.

01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:30.269
To see our son grow up.

01:28:33.840 --> 01:28:35.558
So I went on living

01:28:37.240 --> 01:28:39.071
because she told me to.

01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:42.556
Because of her, really,

01:28:44.080 --> 01:28:48.073
and with her and for her.

01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:53.429
And every day since then,

01:28:55.080 --> 01:28:57.594
I've accepted
the risk of dying

01:28:59.760 --> 01:29:02.479
because I don't want
to just survive.

01:29:06.760 --> 01:29:08.955
I want to truly live.

01:29:14.160 --> 01:29:16.276
So I implore you,

01:29:17.920 --> 01:29:20.115
go back to your hospitals,

01:29:20.760 --> 01:29:23.433
and you tell
your disabled patients

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.833
that they too
can truly live.

01:29:29.960 --> 01:29:31.951
You all have this power

01:29:35.280 --> 01:29:40.513
to open the gates
and set them free.

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:17.718
Jonathan!

01:30:19.320 --> 01:30:20.548
Jonathan!

01:30:25.280 --> 01:30:27.271
Help me turn him
on his side.

01:30:30.160 --> 01:30:32.720
Jonathan. Help me turn him
on his side.

01:30:39.200 --> 01:30:40.235
That's it.

01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:42.788
All right, love.
All right, darling.

01:30:50.680 --> 01:30:52.272
It's all right.

01:30:52.360 --> 01:30:55.511
All right, we can put him
on his back now. That's it.

01:30:58.880 --> 01:31:00.359
All right, darling.

01:31:01.720 --> 01:31:03.039
Robin?

01:31:05.320 --> 01:31:07.356
Do what you can to clean
up the mess, darling.

01:31:21.520 --> 01:31:26.230
It's all right.
It's all right.

01:31:31.440 --> 01:31:34.398
It's all right, dear boy.
It's all right.

01:31:37.560 --> 01:31:39.118
I'm afraid this is
what happens

01:31:39.200 --> 01:31:41.634
after a number of years
on a respirator.

01:31:41.720 --> 01:31:44.473
The lining of the lungs
becomes irritated.

01:31:44.600 --> 01:31:47.637
You get small abrasions.
You get bleeding.

01:31:48.640 --> 01:31:52.030
The fact is,
it's gonna get worse.

01:31:52.120 --> 01:31:54.395
More bleeds.
Bigger bleeds.

01:31:54.480 --> 01:32:00.316
And... Well, the risk is
you drown in your own blood.

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:56.152
Remember that story
in Kenya about

01:32:59.160 --> 01:33:01.390
Mau Mau prisoners?

01:33:04.520 --> 01:33:05.919
Yes.
Ah...

01:33:09.960 --> 01:33:11.951
Their leader said,

01:33:15.640 --> 01:33:18.438
"I give my men
permission to die."

01:33:22.800 --> 01:33:24.791
And then by morning,

01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:31.636
they just all passed away.

01:33:35.400 --> 01:33:38.676
And I have decided
it's time for me, too.

01:33:41.640 --> 01:33:43.870
I'm going to let myself go.

01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:54.037
And what about me?

01:33:57.240 --> 01:33:59.879
You're going to be free
at last.

01:34:00.720 --> 01:34:02.233
I don't want...

01:34:02.320 --> 01:34:03.389
No.

01:34:04.440 --> 01:34:05.555
No.

01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:09.391
God, you're a stupid,
stupid man.

01:34:11.560 --> 01:34:15.394
What do you think I've been
doing all these years?

01:34:16.080 --> 01:34:17.399
Hmm?

01:34:18.920 --> 01:34:21.354
Your life is my life.

01:34:23.800 --> 01:34:24.949
And...

01:34:25.040 --> 01:34:26.359
I'm sorry, Jonathan.

01:34:26.440 --> 01:34:27.919
Jonathan.

01:34:32.360 --> 01:34:34.351
You should let her be.

01:35:05.200 --> 01:35:07.668
All right. Fine.

01:35:07.760 --> 01:35:09.876
Fine, have it your way.
You always do.

01:35:11.040 --> 01:35:15.033
But don't you ever, ever say
that you did it for me.

01:35:23.200 --> 01:35:25.236
You do know
that it's against the law.

01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:31.233
Well, yes, but who's
going to know?

01:35:33.400 --> 01:35:38.997
Well, if Diana or Jonathan
were to get involved,

01:35:40.200 --> 01:35:42.156
could end up in prison.

01:35:45.800 --> 01:35:47.916
They're not
going to be involved.

01:35:48.760 --> 01:35:50.079
And what about you?

01:35:50.160 --> 01:35:51.434
Me.

01:35:54.360 --> 01:35:58.592
I've been breaking the rules
my whole life.

01:36:09.600 --> 01:36:11.670
So promise me you know
what you're asking.

01:36:13.600 --> 01:36:15.795
Oh, yes, I know
what I'm asking.

01:36:19.840 --> 01:36:21.478
We must buck him up.

01:36:22.680 --> 01:36:27.117
You know, get him out
of this morbid frame of mind.

01:36:29.520 --> 01:36:32.159
Make him see how much
his friends need him.

01:36:32.240 --> 01:36:36.950
Colin. We're not going to keep Robin
alive for the sake of his friends.

01:36:44.960 --> 01:36:46.518
No, of course not.

01:36:52.080 --> 01:36:54.036
But I expect they'd
like to say goodbye.

01:36:54.320 --> 01:36:55.673
Oh...

01:36:56.800 --> 01:36:58.153
Hi.

01:36:58.240 --> 01:36:59.240
Toby.

01:37:00.240 --> 01:37:02.629
He's telling everyone
it's his leaving party.

01:37:02.720 --> 01:37:04.711
What, even the girls?
Trevor.

01:37:06.880 --> 01:37:08.871
Watch the steps.
Drop coming up.

01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:42.398
You're planning
another great escape.

01:37:43.960 --> 01:37:46.235
Uh... It's time to go.

01:37:49.080 --> 01:37:51.071
For me, anyway.

01:37:53.800 --> 01:37:56.234
Just like
the last time.

01:37:57.240 --> 01:37:59.231
Not waiting for your friends.

01:38:00.400 --> 01:38:03.153
No, you're too slow
for me, Paddy.

01:38:07.440 --> 01:38:08.668
You owe me £5.

01:38:09.040 --> 01:38:10.189
Ah...

01:38:28.920 --> 01:38:32.151
Well, this is
a Saint-Émilion '59.

01:38:32.240 --> 01:38:36.074
My last bottle of one of the
greatest wines ever made.

01:38:36.160 --> 01:38:37.388
Jonathan, glasses, hmm?

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:41.558
Teddy.

01:38:42.400 --> 01:38:45.153
Robin.
Harry.

01:38:45.240 --> 01:38:48.835
We've been friends
for many, many years.

01:38:49.760 --> 01:38:51.352
I'd just like to say...

01:38:53.520 --> 01:38:54.873
Harry.
Harry.

01:38:54.960 --> 01:38:56.916
I broke a chair.
No, you didn't. You didn't.

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.150
You didn't.

01:38:59.240 --> 01:39:00.639
Give him a drop of that.

01:39:00.720 --> 01:39:01.840
This'll sort you out.

01:39:01.880 --> 01:39:03.016
This'll put hairs
on your chest.

01:39:03.040 --> 01:39:06.271
Robin, old man,
here's to you.

01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:08.635
I'm drinking to each
and every one of you.

01:39:09.280 --> 01:39:11.191
- Cheers, Robin.
- Cheers, old boy.

01:39:12.520 --> 01:39:14.272
Goodbye-ee

01:39:14.360 --> 01:39:15.713
Goodbye-ee

01:39:15.800 --> 01:39:19.952
Wipe the tear,
baby dear, from your eye-ee

01:39:20.040 --> 01:39:23.157
Though it's hard to part,
I know

01:39:24.160 --> 01:39:27.277
I'll be tickled to death
to go

01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:29.635
Don't cry-ee

01:39:29.720 --> 01:39:31.517
Don't sigh-ee

01:39:31.600 --> 01:39:35.354
There's a silver lining
in the sky-ee

01:39:35.440 --> 01:39:37.749
Bonsoir, old thing

01:39:37.840 --> 01:39:39.319
Cheerio, chin-chin

01:39:39.400 --> 01:39:43.757
Napoo, toodle-oo, goodbye-ee

01:40:14.240 --> 01:40:16.071
There's something
I have to say.

01:40:19.560 --> 01:40:22.677
I want you to know what a
difference you've made to my life.

01:40:25.280 --> 01:40:27.271
It's not always been
easy for me.

01:40:29.960 --> 01:40:34.954
Every time I come here,
I go away stronger.

01:40:36.120 --> 01:40:38.475
And it's not because
you're worse off than me.

01:40:38.560 --> 01:40:40.312
No, no, no.

01:40:43.760 --> 01:40:45.751
It's who you are, Robin.

01:40:46.920 --> 01:40:49.718
Or who you've turned yourself into.
God knows how.

01:40:52.520 --> 01:40:54.112
Thank you, Col.

01:40:56.360 --> 01:40:57.998
I'm gonna miss you.

01:41:04.240 --> 01:41:05.639
Robin.

01:41:21.480 --> 01:41:22.913
I'm sorry.

01:41:39.800 --> 01:41:40.915
Darling.

01:41:46.800 --> 01:41:48.438
That's enough.

01:42:03.760 --> 01:42:05.159
Yes.

01:42:15.120 --> 01:42:17.350
I expect
you know this, but,

01:42:24.640 --> 01:42:26.631
just in case...

01:42:30.920 --> 01:42:33.832
No one could have loved you
as much as I've loved you.

01:42:43.280 --> 01:42:44.713
I know.

01:42:51.960 --> 01:42:53.359
My love.

01:42:57.640 --> 01:42:59.039
And my life.

01:43:08.400 --> 01:43:10.356
Me, too, Robin.

01:43:13.520 --> 01:43:14.873
My love.

01:43:17.400 --> 01:43:18.799
My life.

01:43:59.280 --> 01:44:00.679
Clem.

01:44:01.320 --> 01:44:02.719
Hello, Robin.

01:44:04.920 --> 01:44:06.319
It's time.

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:09.399
All right.

01:44:10.760 --> 01:44:12.751
When?
Today.

01:44:15.760 --> 01:44:17.159
Now.

01:44:17.960 --> 01:44:20.793
I'll be with you at 11:30.

01:44:25.920 --> 01:44:28.388
It's like a military op, eh?

01:44:29.440 --> 01:44:32.512
You can count on me.
Synchronize watches.

01:44:34.880 --> 01:44:36.359
I'll be there.

01:44:38.440 --> 01:44:40.078
Thank you, Clem.

01:44:41.960 --> 01:44:43.359
See you soon.

01:45:06.440 --> 01:45:08.078
Get Jonathan.

01:45:11.520 --> 01:45:12.873
Jonathan.

01:45:36.080 --> 01:45:40.232
I need you both to listen
very, very carefully.

01:45:43.720 --> 01:45:45.711
Just before 11:30,

01:45:48.080 --> 01:45:50.071
you're to leave the house.

01:45:55.640 --> 01:45:57.631
And you're to come back

01:46:01.520 --> 01:46:03.511
at 12:00 on the button.

01:46:05.800 --> 01:46:07.233
Okay.

01:46:08.360 --> 01:46:10.590
Promise me
I'll have time to say goodbye.

01:46:13.400 --> 01:46:15.391
Yes, there'll be time.

01:46:18.240 --> 01:46:20.435
Hello. I haven't
seen you in a while.

01:46:20.560 --> 01:46:22.278
So what can I get you all today?

01:46:23.040 --> 01:46:25.474
I'm fine, thanks. Mum?

01:46:57.160 --> 01:46:58.798
I'm still here.

01:47:01.560 --> 01:47:03.551
You go first, Jonathan.

01:47:20.240 --> 01:47:21.832
Bye, Dad.

01:47:27.440 --> 01:47:29.078
I love you.

01:47:31.160 --> 01:47:32.798
My own son.

01:47:37.760 --> 01:47:39.478
My boy.

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:50.072
You have given me
more than you can ever know.

01:48:18.920 --> 01:48:23.516
Now, I don't have
a farewell speech.

01:48:24.720 --> 01:48:26.711
You don't mind, do you?

01:48:35.200 --> 01:48:36.633
No.

01:48:40.800 --> 01:48:42.791
You've given me
a wonderful life.

01:48:47.840 --> 01:48:50.638
It wasn't quite
what you expected.

01:48:50.720 --> 01:48:52.551
No.

01:48:57.640 --> 01:48:59.153
No, nor me.

01:49:25.600 --> 01:49:27.238
Thank you.

01:49:28.320 --> 01:49:29.912
For choosing to live.
