02:15.000 --> 02:17.834
[GOKU] Boy, this
place is really strange.

02:17.917 --> 02:19.167
[BULMA] Isn't there
supposed to be a town

02:19.250 --> 02:21.084
around here somewhere, Oolong?

02:21.167 --> 02:23.000
I don't know.
I've never been in this

02:23.084 --> 02:24.750
neck of the woods before!

02:24.834 --> 02:26.959
[beeping]

02:27.042 --> 02:30.834
Oh no! We're
just about on empty, guys!

02:30.917 --> 02:34.209
[BULMA] Oh great! We should've
filled up at that last town!

02:34.292 --> 02:36.417
[OOLONG] We were going
to, but some 'dumb bunny'

02:36.500 --> 02:39.084
insisted we were almost there.

02:39.167 --> 02:40.584
Hey, don't blame me!

02:41.375 --> 02:43.792
Watch it!
I'm trying to drive!

02:43.875 --> 02:45.542
[BULMA] You're not
trying hard enough!

02:45.917 --> 02:49.334
Hey! What are you doing?
Keep your eyes on the road!

02:49.417 --> 02:51.959
[OOLONG] Great! Just what
I need, a backseat driver!

02:52.042 --> 02:53.417
[BULMA] At least I
know how to drive!

02:53.500 --> 02:55.625
[OOLONG] Yeah!
You're driving me crazy!

02:55.709 --> 02:56.709
[BULMA] Look out!

02:56.792 --> 02:58.625
[screaming]

03:00.959 --> 03:02.875
[GOKU] Ha ha! That was fun!

03:02.959 --> 03:05.125
[BULMA] Fun? I
could've been killed!

03:05.209 --> 03:07.542
Ha! Hear that?

03:07.625 --> 03:10.209
What a bunch of clowns, huh?
They're gonna lead us right to

03:10.292 --> 03:11.709
that last Dragon Ball!

03:11.792 --> 03:12.834
Yeah!

03:12.917 --> 03:14.042
[BULMA] Keep your
hands on the wheel!

03:14.125 --> 03:15.459
[OOLONG] Keep your
hands on your mouth!

03:15.542 --> 03:17.250
[BULMA] You were
picking your snout again!

03:17.334 --> 03:19.334
What a pretty voice.

03:23.167 --> 03:25.542
Did I say pretty
voice? I, uh meant to say

03:25.625 --> 03:26.959
she has a pretty face.

03:27.042 --> 03:29.375
No, no, I mean, I said she
has a pretty--No, I didn't

03:29.459 --> 03:34.125
mean to say pretty at all.
I don't know what I meant.

03:36.209 --> 03:38.917
[PUAR] Here! I think you
need to cool off, Yamcha.

03:42.292 --> 03:44.542
[gulping]

03:46.375 --> 03:47.875
That hit the spot!

03:50.167 --> 03:50.834
[OOLONG] Was not!

03:50.917 --> 03:51.917
[BULMA] I saw you!

03:52.000 --> 03:53.375
[OOLONG] Was not!

04:13.667 --> 04:15.917
See, I was right after all,
Oolong!

04:16.000 --> 04:18.166
"See, I was right after all."

04:21.875 --> 04:23.042
[gasps]

04:25.042 --> 04:25.917
[GOKU] Hello there!

04:27.625 --> 04:29.834
[screaming]

04:29.917 --> 04:31.500
Golly!

04:33.584 --> 04:35.084
[OOLONG] That's the way
it happens sometimes, kid.

04:35.417 --> 04:37.125
[BULMA] Maybe for you it does.

04:37.209 --> 04:38.084
[OOLONG] Who asked you?

04:38.834 --> 04:40.167
Hello, can I--

04:41.875 --> 04:42.959
[OOLONG] Fill her up, please.

04:48.792 --> 04:50.459
[GOKU] Hey, Bulma!

04:50.917 --> 04:53.209
These people all seem
scared of you for some reason.

04:53.625 --> 04:56.500
[BULMA] It's not every day they
get to see a beautiful stranger.

04:56.584 --> 04:57.959
[BULMA] Ha, I'm going shopping!

05:00.167 --> 05:02.417
I wonder if they sell
Dyno Caps in this town.

05:07.750 --> 05:09.000
[BULMA] Goku was right.

05:09.084 --> 05:11.625
[BULMA] These people here
really are scared of me.

05:11.709 --> 05:13.125
Creepy!

05:14.917 --> 05:16.917
[BULMA] Ah-ha! Here
we go! Dyno Caps!

05:19.750 --> 05:22.084
There you go,
it's full to the brim!

05:22.167 --> 05:24.375
Can you wait just a minute?
Our friend's gonna be

05:24.459 --> 05:26.625
right back with some cash.

05:26.709 --> 05:29.125
Oh no, no, no,
that's okay!

05:29.209 --> 05:31.292
It is on my house!

05:33.375 --> 05:34.750
[giggling]

05:38.334 --> 05:40.167
[BULMA] You certainly
have a wide selection here.

05:41.875 --> 05:44.750
Well, do you
have any XB6's?

05:44.834 --> 05:46.542
Yes, and sevens.

05:46.625 --> 05:50.000
Alright then... I'll
take two of those there...

05:50.084 --> 05:51.917
[BULMA] And three XB7's please.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.459
[SHOP KEEP] Yes, whatever
you wish. Here you are,

05:53.542 --> 05:54.917
please take them!

05:55.000 --> 05:57.084
Well, I guess that's
all I'll be needing today.

05:57.167 --> 05:58.667
So, how much?

05:58.750 --> 06:01.750
No! Nothing!
Please, just take them!

06:01.834 --> 06:03.209
Oh?

06:05.334 --> 06:06.625
[screaming]

06:06.709 --> 06:09.084
Talk about a bargain!
There are some expensive

06:09.167 --> 06:12.334
Dyno Caps, and I managed
to get them all for free!

06:12.417 --> 06:14.542
You know, I sure am glad
some people know how to

06:14.625 --> 06:16.667
treat a beautiful
stranger like me!

06:24.917 --> 06:28.125
[YAMCHA] It sure is taking
them a long time to get gas!

06:36.792 --> 06:38.292
[screaming]

06:38.375 --> 06:39.750
[brakes squealing]

06:40.167 --> 06:42.667
[RABBIT A] Bah! This
town is so boring.

06:42.750 --> 06:45.000
[RABBIT B] Why don't
we stir things up around here?

06:45.084 --> 06:46.500
[RABBIT A] Sounds good to me.

06:49.667 --> 06:52.375
[BULMA They're not really my
style, but they're comfortable.

06:54.542 --> 06:56.750
I guess they'll have to do.

06:57.459 --> 07:00.167
Anything's better than that
dumb bunny outfit I was wearing.

07:03.834 --> 07:05.209
Whoa, I almost
forgot about these.

07:07.875 --> 07:09.917
[BULMA] Here!
That's a good look for you.

07:10.667 --> 07:12.709
What? You mean
you're not a member of

07:12.792 --> 07:14.792
the Rabbits, young lady?

07:14.875 --> 07:17.625
The Rabbits?
What's that?

07:17.709 --> 07:19.459
[MAN] Get out of here!

07:19.542 --> 07:20.584
--Man!
--And stay out!

07:20.667 --> 07:22.959
How dare you play
such a dirty trick?!

07:26.834 --> 07:29.500
Now, for some reason,
nobody's even looking at me.

07:29.584 --> 07:31.917
And they're definitely
don't look scared anymore.

07:36.959 --> 07:38.750
Hey, Puar,
here comes that girl.

07:40.750 --> 07:43.000
Hey guys! I got
some really great stuff here.

07:43.084 --> 07:44.209
[GOKU] I hope you
got some food in there.

07:44.292 --> 07:45.792
I'm starving!

07:45.875 --> 07:47.750
[OOLONG] Food? Are you kiddin'?
Those bags are full of make-up

07:47.834 --> 07:49.209
and clothes, buddy.

07:53.667 --> 07:56.167
[RABBIT A] Yuck! These
apples are rotten!

07:58.334 --> 08:00.042
Hey!
We've been ripped off!

08:00.125 --> 08:02.209
You heard him!
We want our money back!

08:02.292 --> 08:03.917
But you got them free!

08:04.000 --> 08:05.667
[RABBIT A] You
don't hear so good!

08:05.750 --> 08:08.209
He said we want our money back!

08:08.292 --> 08:10.792
[MAN] Here, here!
Please, forgive!

08:13.875 --> 08:15.375
[BOY] Mama!

08:15.459 --> 08:20.000
[RABBIT B] Hey! Don't you
know that no one's supposed

08:20.084 --> 08:22.250
to cross the path of a Rabbit?!

08:22.334 --> 08:24.500
Yes! I'm sorry,
but he's just a boy,

08:24.584 --> 08:26.792
he doesn't know any better!

08:29.084 --> 08:30.750
[RABBIT B] Here's a
lesson he'll remember!

08:32.167 --> 08:35.458
Holy cow!
These goons are serious!

08:35.542 --> 08:37.750
So they're the Rabbits!

08:39.875 --> 08:43.625
Look, buddy.
There's a new chick in town!

08:47.334 --> 08:49.542
[RABBIT A] How do
you like them apples?

08:50.459 --> 08:53.292
[RABBIT B] My, my, my.

08:53.375 --> 08:55.584
Hey there, pretty lady, how'd
you like to spend some time

08:55.667 --> 08:58.709
with a couple of real
men? Yes, maybe?

08:58.792 --> 09:00.834
Why? Have you seen any?

09:01.709 --> 09:03.709
You must be new in town
if you're dumb enough to

09:03.792 --> 09:05.917
talk to the Rabbits like that!

09:06.000 --> 09:08.084
[RABBIT B] Maybe we should
teach her some manners?

09:08.167 --> 09:10.667
[BULMA] If anyone has
anything to learn, it's you

09:10.750 --> 09:12.834
two Cro-Magnon morons!

09:13.167 --> 09:14.542
[BULLMA] Grown
men in rabbit ears!

09:14.625 --> 09:17.875
Ha! Can you believe
these two idiots?

09:17.959 --> 09:21.959
[BULMA] Come on, you
guys. We're leaving.

09:22.042 --> 09:23.709
[RABBIT B] Hold it.

09:26.500 --> 09:30.292
What's the big hurry, toots?
The party's just starting!

09:30.875 --> 09:32.542
[RABBIT B] Yes, maybe.

09:34.542 --> 09:37.125
Goku, these bad men
need to be taken care of

09:37.209 --> 09:39.584
or they might hurt us.

09:40.959 --> 09:41.709
Oh, okay.

09:43.209 --> 09:45.250
Wait!
Goku's no match for a pistol!

09:46.292 --> 09:48.625
Yeah!
He's gonna "take care" of us.

09:48.709 --> 09:51.625
Frightening, isn't he?
Little pipsqueak.

09:59.084 --> 10:01.917
[RABBIT B] Oh my, I hope
he doesn't hurt us too bad!

10:02.000 --> 10:03.375
[RABBIT A] Yeah!

10:04.875 --> 10:05.792
[RABBIT B] What the--?

10:06.167 --> 10:07.750
[shots firing]

10:09.542 --> 10:14.667
[blows landing]

10:17.834 --> 10:19.209
[BULMA] One down and one to go!

10:20.167 --> 10:21.542
Hey, kid!

10:28.417 --> 10:30.750
[screaming]

10:41.042 --> 10:42.500
I don't think
those guys are gonna

10:42.584 --> 10:44.709
hurt anyone now, Bulma.

10:44.792 --> 10:46.959
You're right!
Thanks to you!

10:48.209 --> 10:49.792
[OOLONG] Hmph! I
coulda done that.

10:50.875 --> 10:52.375
Ha!

10:52.459 --> 10:53.875
Those guys didn't know what they
were getting themselves into.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.500
Now you've done it!
You've insulted the Rabbits,

11:01.584 --> 11:04.584
and you're gonna pay
big time for this, kid!

11:04.667 --> 11:06.584
No, he didn't
insult the Rabbits.

11:06.667 --> 11:08.792
He just beat them up!

11:10.000 --> 11:11.625
Boss, this is Rabbit One!

11:11.709 --> 11:13.250
Come to town, pronto!

11:13.709 --> 11:15.417
[gasping]

11:15.500 --> 11:17.750
We got ourselves a
troublemaker down here.

11:19.209 --> 11:22.375
[screaming]

11:22.459 --> 11:25.042
A curse on you! Thanks
to you, the boss is coming!

11:29.875 --> 11:35.667
[doors slamming]

11:40.709 --> 11:43.709
[GOKU] Whoa?

11:43.792 --> 11:45.584
[OOLONG] I got a nose
for trouble, guys, and this

11:45.667 --> 11:48.792
place stinks! I tell ya
something bad is gonna happen!

11:48.875 --> 11:50.459
I knew we never
should have stopped here.

11:50.542 --> 11:52.334
I wanted to keep going!

11:52.417 --> 11:55.500
[BULMA] Oolong, you did not! We
came here for gas, remember?!

11:55.584 --> 11:57.542
[OOLONG] Fine, we
got our gas, let's go!

12:39.375 --> 12:41.459
Well, nothing's happening.

12:43.125 --> 12:45.459
[OOLONG] Listen, I
say we get out of here

12:45.542 --> 12:46.917
before something does happen.

12:49.042 --> 12:52.042
Well, I'm not going to let
a couple of goons wearing

12:52.125 --> 12:53.917
rabbit ears scare me away!

12:54.000 --> 12:55.084
[groaning]

12:55.167 --> 12:56.959
Hey, get up!
You're okay.

12:57.042 --> 12:59.292
[RABBIT B] Oh, but it hurts...

12:59.375 --> 13:01.625
[RABBIT A] Don't worry. The
boss is coming, and he'll do

13:01.709 --> 13:04.000
his special thing
to those intruders!

13:05.459 --> 13:06.834
"Special thing"?

13:07.625 --> 13:09.542
Hey, what's this
"special thing"?

13:09.625 --> 13:12.084
[RABBIT A] Just a little trick
our boss does to entertain.

13:12.167 --> 13:14.875
So stick around
and enjoy the show.

13:16.125 --> 13:17.584
[RABBIT B] Don't worry,
he's not going to turn

13:17.667 --> 13:19.500
you into a carrot, or anything!

13:22.542 --> 13:23.875
I don't like carrots.

13:24.500 --> 13:27.042
Hey!
Let's get out of here, Goku!

13:27.125 --> 13:29.042
I wanna stay and see
what everyone around here

13:29.125 --> 13:30.750
is so scared of.

13:31.625 --> 13:33.042
Yeah, me too.

13:33.125 --> 13:35.042
[horn honking]

13:49.167 --> 13:52.250
[RABBIT A] Here comes the
boss! Hey, boss over here!

13:52.334 --> 13:54.792
[RABBIT B] Are my ears
on straight? Yes, yes, maybe.

14:11.292 --> 14:13.750
[OOLONG] Whoa! Looks like
the circus has come to town!

14:13.834 --> 14:16.042
[RABBIT A and RABBIT B]
Oh, Boss, help us!

14:17.042 --> 14:18.542
Knock it off, you mugs!

14:18.625 --> 14:20.750
Just point me out the sap that
thinks he's tough enough to take

14:20.834 --> 14:22.292
on the mighty Rabbits!

14:22.375 --> 14:23.750
[RABBIT A and RABBIT B]
That's him, over there!

14:24.500 --> 14:26.917
[BULMA] You mean that
old furball is their leader?

14:27.000 --> 14:28.459
[OOLONG] Yeah, look
at him! He looks like a

14:28.542 --> 14:30.334
reject from an Easter parade!

14:30.417 --> 14:32.209
[RABBIT A] We heard that, pig!

14:32.292 --> 14:33.875
[OOLONG] Oh yeah?
What are you gonna do?

14:33.959 --> 14:36.417
Wiggle your nose and tickle me?!

14:36.500 --> 14:39.292
[RABBIT B] Awfully big
words for a bacon bit!

14:41.042 --> 14:42.959
[RABBIT A] Good one!

14:43.334 --> 14:45.542
I know I've seen
that rabbit before...

14:46.792 --> 14:48.209
[BOSS RABBIT] You call
yourself "Rabbits" and

14:48.292 --> 14:50.209
you got beaten up by a kid?

14:50.292 --> 14:51.917
[RABBIT A and RABBIT B]
Uh, sorry Boss...

14:52.000 --> 14:53.417
[BOSS RABBIT] Quit groveling!

14:53.834 --> 14:54.917
Watch this!

14:56.000 --> 15:03.417
[howling]

15:03.500 --> 15:05.292
[BOSS RABBIT] Let's
shake hands, baby!

15:06.875 --> 15:08.250
I wouldn't trust him, Bulma.

15:09.042 --> 15:11.792
Hey, did you want
to be friends with us?

15:11.875 --> 15:13.834
[BOSS RABBIT] Certainly!

15:13.917 --> 15:16.834
Now I remember!
His touch is his weapon!

15:16.917 --> 15:19.584
If they shake his hand
they're goners for sure!

15:21.709 --> 15:23.334
There! Now make
like a nice bunny and

15:23.417 --> 15:25.292
hop out of here, would ya?

15:28.417 --> 15:29.792
You touched me!

15:35.292 --> 15:38.375
[GOKU] You turned
Bulma into a carrot!

15:38.792 --> 15:39.917
[BOSS RABBIT]
Want a bite, maybe?

15:41.417 --> 15:43.417
[RABBIT A] Serves you right
for messin' with da boss!

15:44.625 --> 15:48.209
His name is Monster Carrot,
and his touch is lethal!

15:48.709 --> 15:50.125
[GOKU] You bully!

15:50.500 --> 15:51.917
Change her back!

15:54.709 --> 15:55.959
Sure, kid, if you want to end

15:56.042 --> 15:58.709
up like your friend. Why
don't you come and get me?

15:59.584 --> 16:01.125
[MONSTER CARROT] But you gotta
like vegetables, 'cause if you

16:01.209 --> 16:04.084
touch me, you're gonna be one!

16:06.084 --> 16:08.750
Come on, Goku, use
your Power Pole! That way you

16:08.834 --> 16:10.125
won't have to touch him!

16:10.209 --> 16:11.875
Yeah, that's right! Ha!

16:18.917 --> 16:22.334
[MONSTER CARROT] Stop! Don't
forget about your friend here!

16:23.792 --> 16:26.625
[laughing]

16:26.709 --> 16:28.959
Kid! You take one more
step and I'll have this

16:29.042 --> 16:31.084
delicious carrot for my lunch!

16:33.209 --> 16:36.792
[laughing]

16:36.875 --> 16:39.459
Alright,
you win! I give up!

16:40.417 --> 16:41.334
Oolong!

16:41.417 --> 16:42.709
What do you think
I should do now?

16:42.792 --> 16:44.167
[OOLONG] Run for it!

16:45.625 --> 16:47.625
[RABBIT A] Man,
that pig is flying!

16:48.334 --> 16:49.750
Oolong,
you're not a pig!

16:49.834 --> 16:51.417
You're a big chicken!

16:51.500 --> 16:53.542
Tough break!
You're on your own, kid!

16:53.625 --> 16:55.417
It's just you and
the Rabbits now!

16:55.500 --> 16:56.875
Boys! Go get 'em!

16:58.000 --> 16:59.459
[RABBIT A and RABBIT B]
Sure thing, Boss!

17:00.584 --> 17:01.834
Yes!

17:01.917 --> 17:04.666
I'm gonna pound him
flat like a postage stamp!

17:06.834 --> 17:14.541
[blows landing]

17:14.625 --> 17:17.291
Puar! Come on!
That kid needs our help!

17:17.375 --> 17:20.750
It's up to us to get him out
of this mess! Otherwise we'll

17:20.834 --> 17:22.541
never see those Dragon Balls!

17:23.584 --> 17:25.875
[YAMCHA] Change into a
bird and snatch that carrot!

17:25.959 --> 17:27.334
[PUAR] Right!

17:36.084 --> 17:37.584
Come on, pick it
up a little, boys.

17:37.667 --> 17:39.709
I don't have all day, you know.

17:39.792 --> 17:44.000
[blows landing]

17:51.625 --> 17:53.917
[screaming]

18:09.709 --> 18:11.417
We've got the carrot, Goku!

18:11.500 --> 18:14.042
Now you can finish him
off with your Power Pole!

18:14.417 --> 18:15.500
Hey!

18:15.584 --> 18:18.667
You're helping us!
That's real nice of you!

18:18.750 --> 18:21.750
Never mind that!
Get Monster Carrot!

18:21.834 --> 18:22.917
Right.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.042
[MONSTER CARROT]
Come back here, thief!

18:25.709 --> 18:29.750
I! Want! My! Carrot!

18:30.750 --> 18:32.250
[MONSTER CARROT] Gotcha! Uh-oh!

18:32.750 --> 18:34.125
[YAMCHA] Yeah, here she comes!

18:35.917 --> 18:38.584
[MONSTER CARROT] Ah, I
want that carrot, you dumb bird!

18:38.667 --> 18:40.167
Gimme, gimme, gimme!

18:41.167 --> 18:43.750
Good work, Puar, now
bring that carrot over here!

18:43.834 --> 18:45.209
And hurry!

18:48.000 --> 18:49.375
[MONSTER CARROT] Touch me!

18:56.834 --> 18:58.042
[GOKU and YAMCHA] Ow...

18:58.125 --> 18:59.500
[screaming]

19:06.792 --> 19:08.250
Hey! If we smash
into him, we'll

19:08.334 --> 19:10.000
touch and turn into carrots!

19:23.834 --> 19:26.167
Are you looking for
this, Mister Rabbit?

19:38.625 --> 19:40.917
[MONSTER CARROT] Stop! What
about your little friend?!

19:42.125 --> 19:43.875
That's right. You
don't want anything

19:43.959 --> 19:45.334
to happen to her, do ya?

19:47.042 --> 19:50.584
[screaming]

19:52.834 --> 19:55.750
[MASTER CARROT] Whoa! Who are
you? Where did you come from?

19:55.834 --> 19:58.167
[PUAR] Touch me! All
I want is a little touch.

19:58.250 --> 19:59.792
Just one, little touch!

19:59.875 --> 20:02.834
No! Stay back! Stay back!

20:02.917 --> 20:05.209
Goku, time to
use your Power Pole!

20:07.000 --> 20:09.292
[GOKU] Power Pole! Extend!

20:16.000 --> 20:20.125
[screaming]

20:20.209 --> 20:22.584
Hey! You better change her back!

20:22.667 --> 20:24.334
Or else I'm gonna
whack you again!

20:25.959 --> 20:27.334
Whack me again?

20:27.959 --> 20:29.459
Yeah, whack you again.

20:32.292 --> 20:33.709
Okay, I guess you win!

20:39.667 --> 20:40.792
Bulma!

20:40.875 --> 20:43.334
Oh man, I feel
like a vegetable.

20:43.417 --> 20:47.042
You were until Yamcha
and Puar helped us!

20:47.459 --> 20:48.834
Yamcha! Where is he?

20:50.250 --> 20:51.750
I guess he
took off already.

20:55.875 --> 20:57.250
She likes you.

20:58.875 --> 21:00.959
You know, it was a lot
easier for me to be around her

21:01.042 --> 21:02.709
when she was just produce!

21:11.000 --> 21:13.167
[RABBIT A] Try not
to touch us, boss!

21:15.459 --> 21:16.334
So, Oolong!

21:16.417 --> 21:17.542
Where were you, huh?

21:17.625 --> 21:20.417
Some friend you are,
running away like that!

21:20.500 --> 21:23.334
I, uh, made sure
no one took the car!

21:23.417 --> 21:25.959
Yeah right! You might
as well have coward stamped

21:26.042 --> 21:28.459
on that big forehead of yours!

21:28.542 --> 21:30.584
Boy, you were a
lot nicer when you

21:30.667 --> 21:31.542
were a carrot, ya know.

21:31.625 --> 21:32.417
[BULMA] I heard that!

21:32.500 --> 21:34.209
[shouting]

21:34.292 --> 21:37.375
That should do it!
Now to finish the job with

21:37.459 --> 21:38.834
my Power Pole!

21:40.750 --> 21:43.584
He's gonna whack us!

21:43.667 --> 21:45.250
[GOKU] Don't worry,
I'm not going to hit you.

21:48.542 --> 21:50.792
Power Pole, extend!

22:02.292 --> 22:04.084
How can we
ever repay you?

22:04.167 --> 22:06.459
Hey, don't sweat it!
This one's on my house!

22:10.792 --> 22:13.000
[BULMA] So, what did you
do with the Rabbit gang?

22:13.084 --> 22:15.542
I took 'em to the moon!

22:18.542 --> 22:20.542
[GOKU] I told them that if they
made enough rabbit treats for

22:20.625 --> 22:23.625
all the kids on Earth, I might
let them come back down.

22:23.709 --> 22:25.084
It should keep
them busy for awhile.

22:25.500 --> 22:26.792
[BULMA] Rabbit treats?

22:26.875 --> 22:29.292
[GOKU] What, don't
you like marshmallows?
