Previously on <i>This Is Us</i>...

00:01.554 --> 00:02.976
The drinking has to stop.

00:02.982 --> 00:06.377
We have to rein it in baby because I
won't have it in my house.

00:06.383 --> 00:07.617
Although when we were together

00:07.618 --> 00:08.918
she said she never
wanted to get married.

00:08.966 --> 00:09.966
Hey, meet Gus.

00:09.992 --> 00:11.210
<i>Yeah, it was very brief.</i>

00:11.216 --> 00:13.476
<i>It was another life. Probably
why she didn't tell you.</i>

00:13.482 --> 00:15.096
You think that I didn't deserve to know

00:15.130 --> 00:16.964
<i>that you had history with him?</i>

00:16.999 --> 00:19.976
You know, you never really
talk about your dad's death.

00:19.992 --> 00:24.095
It's been, um, just blocked
for a really long time.

00:24.539 --> 00:26.775
WILLIAM: <i>Roll all your
windows down, Randall.</i>

00:26.781 --> 00:28.242
<i>Crank up the music.</i>

00:28.248 --> 00:30.570
<i>Let someone else make your bed.</i>

00:34.164 --> 00:35.306
(gasps for air softly)

00:36.742 --> 00:37.742
Mm.

You don't have to pack up his stuff yet.

01:32.773 --> 01:34.601
It's only been a couple days.

01:35.624 --> 01:36.632
I know.

01:41.375 --> 01:42.375
(sighs)

01:42.995 --> 01:44.828
I don't know what to do, Beth.

01:45.715 --> 01:47.539
How do I honor his legacy?

01:48.134 --> 01:49.929
Do I start wearing sweater vests?

01:50.255 --> 01:51.929
Drink more egg creams?

01:52.259 --> 01:53.960
Could get cooler frames.

01:54.597 --> 01:57.031
Like, round ones,
like the hipsters wear.

01:58.094 --> 02:00.250
William was kind of
the O.G. hipster, right?

02:00.281 --> 02:01.370
- Baby.
- Huh?

02:01.370 --> 02:02.429
Listen to me.

02:03.007 --> 02:06.789
The only thing anyone expects
you to do is to plan a service.

02:06.795 --> 02:09.898
- You already did that.
- Like I said, show up for the service,

02:10.124 --> 02:11.507
be with your family,

02:11.646 --> 02:13.531
think of him dearly, and...

02:24.500 --> 02:26.156
You're gonna want to read this.

02:26.736 --> 02:28.773
Hi. Uh, it's Kevin Pearson calling.

02:28.779 --> 02:30.948
I was calling to see if Brandon
Novak was getting my voicemails,

02:30.953 --> 02:32.793
because I've left quite
a few of 'em, and he...

02:33.351 --> 02:34.351
Hello?

02:36.015 --> 02:37.328
She hung up on me.

02:37.625 --> 02:39.192
What, that theater critic's assistant?

02:39.226 --> 02:40.609
Well, not <i>that</i> theater critic.

02:40.615 --> 02:42.460
The theater critic. The <i>Time</i> right?

02:42.466 --> 02:45.228
Shows live or die based on what
Brandon Novak writes about them,

02:45.234 --> 02:47.336
which is why I need him to come
to opening night of my play,

02:47.341 --> 02:49.010
but he won't come to opening
night of my play, because

02:49.015 --> 02:51.437
he already came to opening
night, and I wasn't there, so...

02:51.443 --> 02:52.946
Well, can't you just
explain what happened?

02:52.951 --> 02:54.351
No, I'm not... I can't, you know,

02:54.357 --> 02:55.593
tell them Randall's business.

02:55.599 --> 02:57.640
He's been through
enough, so that's that.

02:57.935 --> 02:58.937
Oh.

02:59.875 --> 03:02.382
You know, you're-you're kind
of sexy when you're loyal.

03:02.388 --> 03:03.359
- Really?
- Yup.

03:03.365 --> 03:04.365
Oh.

03:04.594 --> 03:06.831
Because I give money to the same
charity every year, you know?

03:06.836 --> 03:08.232
You're not sexy when you brag about it.

03:08.237 --> 03:09.289
- Right.
- No.

03:09.295 --> 03:10.295
No.

03:11.344 --> 03:12.531
You know what you should do?

03:12.851 --> 03:14.141
You should sit with
my family at the play.

03:14.146 --> 03:15.689
- Why don't you sit with them?
- No.

03:15.695 --> 03:17.111
- Yes. Come on.
- No, uh-uh. No, I am

03:17.116 --> 03:19.618
slinking in when the
lights go down, back row,

03:19.652 --> 03:22.531
and then, when you take your
bow, I'm-I'm sneaking out,

03:22.722 --> 03:24.914
successfully avoiding
the entire Pearson clan.

03:24.920 --> 03:27.322
- Oh.
- Especially Kate.

03:27.523 --> 03:29.774
Look, we haven't even told
them that we're dating yet.

03:29.780 --> 03:31.221
See, now that's not...
You know what we should do?

03:31.226 --> 03:32.778
We should just tell them that.
We get 'em together, and we say,

03:32.783 --> 03:34.279
"Hey, family, you remember
Sophie, right, my ex-wife?

03:34.284 --> 03:36.423
Well, we're dating exclusively.

03:37.399 --> 03:39.719
Even though she still won't let me
sleep with her, which...

03:39.993 --> 03:41.386
I'm hoping is not because

03:41.392 --> 03:43.604
she's developed some, you
know, weird moles on your body

03:43.610 --> 03:45.251
since the last time I saw you naked?"

03:45.356 --> 03:46.627
- No.
- Or that you think I've lost my touch,

03:46.632 --> 03:47.501
because I guarantee you

03:47.507 --> 03:49.618
- I have <i>not</i> lost my touch.
- Mm-hmm.

03:50.095 --> 03:51.463
What's happening?
Where-where are we going?

03:51.468 --> 03:52.963
- Why are you... ?
- I've got to get to work.

03:52.968 --> 03:55.189
Hey, what, you're gonna leave
me here with a floundering career

03:55.194 --> 03:57.032
- and a lukewarm Americano?
- Kevin.

03:58.165 --> 04:01.384
You're dating the ex-wife
you cheated on 12 years ago,

04:01.938 --> 04:04.141
yet somehow managed to woo back

04:04.147 --> 04:05.907
in a diner with a "C" health rating.

04:06.919 --> 04:09.313
You really think you can't
win over this Novak guy?

04:14.845 --> 04:19.548
So, it seems your grandpa
left you some instructions.

04:19.875 --> 04:21.813
"Dear Tess and Annie,

04:22.282 --> 04:24.610
I know you're probably
feeling a little sad right now,

04:24.789 --> 04:27.090
and I'd like to get you back to smiling.

04:27.259 --> 04:29.292
Because you have two of

04:29.326 --> 04:31.423
RANDALL AND WILLIAM:
my all-time favorite smiles.

04:31.438 --> 04:34.798
WILLIAM: <i>"That's why I'd like
you two to plan my memorial.</i>

04:34.857 --> 04:37.063
<i>Adults make these things sad,</i>

04:37.210 --> 04:39.446
<i>and I want you two to make it fun.</i>

04:40.037 --> 04:42.251
<i>Fill it with things that make you smile.</i>

04:42.257 --> 04:46.016
And make sure your mom and dad
help you execute your vision.

04:46.156 --> 04:48.165
No questions asked."

04:49.118 --> 04:51.337
So, we're in charge of the memorial?

04:51.343 --> 04:52.493
Apparently.

04:53.048 --> 04:56.308
It's tomorrow, right before
Uncle Kevin's play re-opens,

04:56.314 --> 04:59.321
and I've already got the flowers
and the lasagna and the...

05:00.002 --> 05:01.344
(whispering indistinctly)

05:01.829 --> 05:02.970
Okay. We'll take it from here.

05:02.975 --> 05:04.964
Um, if it's all right with you two,

05:04.970 --> 05:06.316
I'd like to give a eulogy.

05:06.351 --> 05:08.079
A eulogy sounds sad.

05:08.126 --> 05:10.235
How 'bout we call it a toast, then?

05:10.595 --> 05:11.722
We'll allow it.

05:13.610 --> 05:15.204
- Well...
- (groans)

05:15.210 --> 05:17.024
I guess I'll cancel the caterer...

05:18.189 --> 05:20.290
and the flowers and the white doves.

05:20.310 --> 05:21.563
You got white doves?

05:21.569 --> 05:23.196
They don't make black ones, Randall.

05:25.134 --> 05:27.141
You know, I heart N.Y.,

05:27.165 --> 05:28.886
but I'm kind of psyched
to get back to L.A.

05:28.892 --> 05:30.072
and get shacked up with my boo.

05:30.077 --> 05:33.173
Yes, Bryce, I need 50 rainbow balloons.

05:33.179 --> 05:34.179
Tomorrow.

05:34.280 --> 05:35.477
They're for a funeral.

05:35.579 --> 05:37.298
My nieces gave me one job.

05:37.567 --> 05:38.837
Can I speak to your supervisor?

05:38.843 --> 05:41.516
Hey. If you want to
talk about William...

05:42.532 --> 05:43.806
or anything,

05:43.812 --> 05:45.829
I know funerals can be difficult.

05:46.688 --> 05:48.386
Especially since you lost your...

05:48.400 --> 05:50.478
I just want things to be special
for Randall and the girls.

05:50.483 --> 05:51.329
Okay.

05:51.377 --> 05:54.516
Oh, I don't know, Sharon,
<i>can</i> you help me?

06:07.178 --> 06:08.194
(sighs)

06:09.655 --> 06:11.655
Oh, come on. Don't do this, Jack.

06:11.913 --> 06:15.110
ALL: ♪ For he's a jolly good fellow ♪

06:15.116 --> 06:17.469
♪ Which nobody can deny. ♪

06:17.482 --> 06:19.592
- (applause)
- Thank you, everybody.

06:20.147 --> 06:21.882
Uh, Jack, you told me to
tell you when it was 5:30.

06:21.887 --> 06:22.887
Okay.

06:23.436 --> 06:24.897
It's 5:30.

06:26.772 --> 06:27.772
Uh, yeah.

06:28.198 --> 06:29.741
- Jack?
- What?

06:29.921 --> 06:33.358
What? We're... we're
celebrating Pench's retirement.

06:34.023 --> 06:34.858
We hate Pench.

06:34.864 --> 06:37.124
- You hate Pench.
- I do hate Pench.

06:37.130 --> 06:39.569
Look, just... it's
time for you to go home

06:39.575 --> 06:41.655
and say a proper good-bye to your wife.

06:41.661 --> 06:42.741
- Yeah.
- Staying here

06:42.747 --> 06:44.202
is not gonna keep her from leaving.

06:44.210 --> 06:45.921
- With her ex-boyfriend.
- Jack...

06:45.927 --> 06:47.499
Two weeks, five hotels.

06:47.505 --> 06:49.740
Night after night, getting back late.

06:49.746 --> 06:51.858
That is ridiculous.

06:52.004 --> 06:53.842
This is Rebecca we're talking about.

06:55.096 --> 06:56.022
Yeah.

06:56.028 --> 06:57.335
- Now, go.
- Yeah.

06:59.648 --> 07:00.788
You leaving?

07:00.794 --> 07:03.405
The real party's happening
after work at Joe's Tavern.

07:03.411 --> 07:05.288
- You should come.
- Night, Heather.

07:06.874 --> 07:08.975
Hi, Amy, yeah, it's Rebecca.

07:09.009 --> 07:10.143
What time did he leave?

07:10.381 --> 07:11.381
Okay.

07:12.246 --> 07:13.905
Yeah, thank you. Bye.

07:14.249 --> 07:15.249
(front door closes)

07:15.783 --> 07:16.819
Hi.

07:17.358 --> 07:18.381
Hey, Dad.

07:18.472 --> 07:20.194
Kitchen, please.

07:20.228 --> 07:21.228
(keys jingle)

07:29.342 --> 07:31.756
How could you be late
today, of all days?

07:31.762 --> 07:33.233
- Is Ben here yet?
- No.

07:33.901 --> 07:34.937
Then I guess I'm not late.

07:34.942 --> 07:36.665
Well, you said you'd be home at 5:30.

07:36.671 --> 07:39.595
- No, I said I would knock off at 5:30.
- I called your office and you didn't.

07:39.600 --> 07:40.875
So, you're checking up on me now?

07:40.880 --> 07:42.577
This is just passive-aggressive, Jack.

07:42.583 --> 07:44.288
- Okay, the kids.
- Yeah.

07:44.294 --> 07:46.085
They need a ride to
Joel's party tonight.

07:46.091 --> 07:47.858
Parents are home, I already checked.

07:47.864 --> 07:50.006
And Randall's robotics
class, do you see?

07:50.012 --> 07:51.296
It's moved to Tuesdays.

07:51.302 --> 07:52.147
I can read, Bec.

07:52.153 --> 07:54.358
And please, please do
not let Kevin and Sophie

07:54.364 --> 07:55.609
be by themselves in the basement.

07:55.614 --> 07:57.228
- They're all over each other.
- (chuckles)

07:57.233 --> 07:59.296
What's so funny? It's disturbing.

07:59.302 --> 08:01.280
You know, the other day,
I came in... (sniffs)

08:01.366 --> 08:03.061
- ... she was nibbling on his ear.
- Mm-mm.

08:03.067 --> 08:05.110
Don't use the word nibbling
in reference to our son.

08:05.116 --> 08:06.639
That is the only way to describe it.

08:07.414 --> 08:09.546
Those ears haven't
seen Q-tips in years.

08:09.552 --> 08:11.155
- No.
- (chuckles softly)

08:11.480 --> 08:12.913
(both laugh)

08:16.310 --> 08:17.546
(horn honks outside)

08:20.817 --> 08:21.850
(sighs)

08:24.669 --> 08:26.703
- (glass clunks on table)
- Time to hit the road.

08:27.888 --> 08:28.905
Yeah.

08:33.523 --> 08:35.023
I'm leaving.

08:35.058 --> 08:36.311
KEVIN: Good luck, Mom.

08:36.317 --> 08:38.928
- You're supposed to say "Break a leg."
- Oh, am I?

08:40.530 --> 08:42.553
Mmm. Bye, baby.

08:42.585 --> 08:44.219
Bye, sweetheart.

08:45.069 --> 08:46.686
Oh, I love you.

08:46.692 --> 08:48.960
I promise I'll call
twice a day, every day.

08:49.115 --> 08:51.381
Have fun, Mom. Seriously.

08:51.387 --> 08:52.553
I will. (chuckles)

08:53.985 --> 08:55.022
(sighs)

08:55.465 --> 08:56.577
(grunts)

08:57.346 --> 08:58.749
I love you, Mom.

08:58.800 --> 08:59.889
I love you more.

08:59.895 --> 09:01.538
- I love you most.
- (Kevin groans)

09:01.544 --> 09:04.038
Be good to each other.
Take care of each other.

09:07.931 --> 09:09.700
- Bye.
- Bye.

09:13.576 --> 09:14.576
(horn honks)

09:26.150 --> 09:27.561
(indistinct talk on TV)

09:30.830 --> 09:31.830
Dad.

09:37.374 --> 09:38.772
Okay, okay.

Everybody knows his damn name, fool.

Hey, Jessie.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.014
Hi, Randall.

10:26.186 --> 10:28.100
Is this an all right time?

10:28.127 --> 10:30.108
I'm happy for the distraction.

10:30.905 --> 10:31.811
How you doing?

10:31.817 --> 10:34.975
Uh... not terribly
well, as it turns out.

10:35.701 --> 10:38.631
Uh, William and I

10:39.061 --> 10:41.723
had our good-byes privately,
before you left... but

10:41.933 --> 10:44.014
- it's still a shock.
- I know.

10:44.020 --> 10:47.780
<i>I'm with my sister in Chicago right now.</i>

10:48.361 --> 10:49.678
It's, um...

10:51.987 --> 10:54.030
it's a very slippery slope for me.

10:54.126 --> 10:55.960
And I needed time.

10:56.803 --> 10:57.991
You know, time away?

10:58.223 --> 10:59.842
Uh, understood.

11:00.092 --> 11:02.749
I told our NA group about his passing,

11:02.755 --> 11:05.178
and, uh, there wasn't
a dry eye in the house.

11:05.184 --> 11:07.485
A young man named Sebastian

11:07.491 --> 11:10.459
insisted that I pass along

11:10.465 --> 11:12.933
his condolences. He was

11:12.939 --> 11:15.407
a young athlete who
was addicted to Vicodin

11:15.413 --> 11:17.214
when he first came to our meetings

11:17.220 --> 11:19.405
and, uh, wanted nothing to do with us.

11:19.687 --> 11:23.561
But William feigned
an interest in football

11:24.030 --> 11:25.565
<i>so the boy would have</i>

11:25.772 --> 11:27.897
<i>someone to relate to.</i>

11:29.022 --> 11:30.822
I'd have loved to have seen William

11:30.850 --> 11:32.952
pretend to know anything about football.

11:32.958 --> 11:34.053
It was...

11:34.834 --> 11:35.842
(sobbing)

11:41.270 --> 11:42.960
It was quite a laugh.

11:43.991 --> 11:45.225
<i>Yeah.</i>

11:45.869 --> 11:49.438
He was a soft armrest

11:49.444 --> 11:51.803
for weary souls to lean on, you know?

11:52.803 --> 11:55.069
Anyway, I...

11:56.538 --> 11:59.835
I'm sure you've got
things going on there.

11:59.841 --> 12:01.991
I don't want to keep you.

12:01.997 --> 12:03.686
Hey, that's okay.

12:04.474 --> 12:06.600
Thanks for calling, Jessie.

12:07.506 --> 12:08.506
Um... be well.

12:08.988 --> 12:10.085
Take care.

12:11.323 --> 12:12.323
Bye.

12:20.666 --> 12:21.764
- (door opens)
- Mr. Novak.

12:21.780 --> 12:24.081
Sorry to just, you
know, barge in like this,

12:24.115 --> 12:26.069
but I really need to talk to you. I'm...

12:26.585 --> 12:27.821
Kevin Pearson, by the way.

12:27.827 --> 12:28.849
- I know who you are.
- Oh, good. (chuckles)

12:28.854 --> 12:30.654
How'd you get in here?

12:30.689 --> 12:32.623
Oh, just bribed the assistant, Tracy.

12:32.657 --> 12:33.999
You know, big Manny fan.

12:34.280 --> 12:37.995
Um, I came here... to beg you...

12:38.881 --> 12:40.460
to come to opening night of my play.

12:40.499 --> 12:42.171
I did go to opening night, you didn't.

12:42.483 --> 12:43.513
I know.

12:44.303 --> 12:46.140
I know that, and I know what
you must be thinking...

12:46.145 --> 12:47.514
I think that you choked.

12:47.939 --> 12:49.573
I think that you realized

12:49.608 --> 12:50.608
without the help of

12:50.642 --> 12:52.109
five takes and a laugh track,

12:52.143 --> 12:55.145
you're nothing but...
a 40-year-old playboy

12:55.180 --> 12:56.303
with no talent.

12:57.796 --> 12:58.897
36 years...

12:59.467 --> 13:01.483
Doesn't matter, doesn't matter.

13:01.489 --> 13:03.061
Neither here nor there.

13:04.285 --> 13:07.788
I literally uprooted my
entire life for this play.

13:07.794 --> 13:09.319
It's the only reason I'm here, sir.

13:09.506 --> 13:11.795
And the crazy part
about this whole thing is

13:11.830 --> 13:14.030
it's actually really good... it is.

13:14.280 --> 13:17.335
But no one's gonna come see it,
sir, unless you tell them to,

13:17.341 --> 13:19.046
so I am begging you, please...

13:21.053 --> 13:22.491
give us another chance.

13:23.061 --> 13:25.827
It's worth it. Just think about it.

13:25.854 --> 13:28.381
- (doorbell rings)
- Oh, hey.

13:28.387 --> 13:30.077
Morning. Sorry to ring,

13:30.083 --> 13:32.116
I saw this crate of
perishables out there,

13:32.122 --> 13:33.122
and I thought I...

13:36.449 --> 13:37.582
Lot of pears.

13:37.632 --> 13:40.506
Yeah, uh, thank you.

13:43.282 --> 13:46.366
I hope you don't mind me
asking... how's William doing?

13:46.773 --> 13:49.530
I haven't seen him lately and
I was starting to get worried.

13:49.816 --> 13:51.725
I know his health wasn't all that good.

13:54.143 --> 13:56.506
Uh, William died last week.

13:57.163 --> 13:58.350
In Memphis.

13:59.492 --> 14:00.764
Wow.

14:02.491 --> 14:03.506
Wow.

14:04.881 --> 14:08.342
Well, he always wanted
to get back there.

14:09.132 --> 14:12.155
I didn't realize you two had
gotten to know each other.

14:12.999 --> 14:15.467
Yeah, on his morning walks.
We got to talking.

14:15.499 --> 14:17.640
You know, people don't stop
to just talk anymore, you know?

14:17.645 --> 14:19.022
We became friends.

14:19.469 --> 14:21.530
He always asked about my daughter.

14:25.499 --> 14:27.069
I'm sorry for your loss.

14:29.900 --> 14:31.499
This neighborhood will miss him.

14:39.734 --> 14:40.819
BETH: Who's it from?

14:41.178 --> 14:43.733
What? Oh.

14:46.733 --> 14:47.733
Really?

14:47.975 --> 14:49.061
Your father dies,

14:49.067 --> 14:50.608
and this is what work sends you?

14:50.670 --> 14:52.077
They've been good to me, Beth.

14:52.124 --> 14:53.789
I've been out of the
office for a while now...

14:53.794 --> 14:55.546
After not taking a
vacation in three years.

14:55.552 --> 14:56.552
Beth...

14:57.358 --> 14:58.358
Okay.

15:02.835 --> 15:04.091
Are you all right?

15:04.492 --> 15:05.561
Mm-hmm.

15:14.451 --> 15:17.349
Okay, here we go. Let's have fun!

15:17.364 --> 15:18.779
Call me, call me when
you want to come home.

15:18.784 --> 15:20.424
SOPHIE: Thanks, Mr. Pearson.
JACK: Uh-huh.

15:25.107 --> 15:27.544
Do you want this taxi
to stop somewhere else?

15:29.068 --> 15:30.536
Are you and Mom all right?

15:32.505 --> 15:33.858
Stop it, we're fine.

15:33.864 --> 15:35.036
You don't seem fine.

15:35.042 --> 15:37.607
Look... it's marriage.

15:37.958 --> 15:40.021
Okay? It's just stuff.

15:40.957 --> 15:42.294
Honestly, we're fine.

15:42.300 --> 15:44.092
Why didn't you go to her show tonight?

15:44.126 --> 15:47.530
Well... first off, it's two hours away.

15:47.536 --> 15:50.411
- Yeah, it's two hours away
- Kate...

15:50.646 --> 15:53.168
Hey, look, you've got
more important things

15:53.202 --> 15:54.568
to worry about being a teenager.

15:54.607 --> 15:58.716
Boys and-and grades and that band

15:58.722 --> 16:01.142
that sounds like they're always
kidding... what's their name?

16:01.177 --> 16:03.169
- Weezer.
- Weezer. Yeah.

16:03.200 --> 16:04.052
Weezer.

16:04.130 --> 16:05.982
Look, your mom and dad, we're the...

16:08.013 --> 16:10.552
we're last thing in the
world you need to worry about.

16:11.619 --> 16:12.619
Okay?

16:13.990 --> 16:15.138
Okay.

16:17.559 --> 16:20.318
Don't sit home tonight all sad.

16:22.599 --> 16:24.966
How can I be sad when
I've got a kid like you?

16:29.052 --> 16:30.052
Bye.

16:30.072 --> 16:31.919
Okay. Have fun.

16:40.380 --> 16:42.183
Rebecca, it's-it's gonna be okay.

16:42.218 --> 16:43.083
They invited us.

16:43.089 --> 16:45.052
No, the girls invited us.

16:45.091 --> 16:47.841
You know things haven't been
the same since he found out,

16:47.847 --> 16:50.099
he just... he tolerates me.

16:50.105 --> 16:52.357
- You don't know that he...
- Yeah, I know my son.

16:53.501 --> 16:54.505
Honey.

16:57.341 --> 16:58.474
Don't get them tangled up.

16:58.480 --> 17:00.380
It was one... It was one balloon.

17:00.386 --> 17:02.903
Hey, geez, you guys
bring enough balloons?

17:02.909 --> 17:04.185
No, actually, we didn't.

17:04.191 --> 17:06.903
Do not poke the bear, alright
man, okay, I beg of you.

17:07.036 --> 17:08.551
The kids asked her to bring 50.

17:08.558 --> 17:09.950
I popped one in the car.

17:10.858 --> 17:13.271
Everything okay? Yeah, I'm fine.

17:13.277 --> 17:17.278
Well, don't you all look
ready for a FUN-eral.

17:18.646 --> 17:19.646
No?

17:19.810 --> 17:22.325
Not even a smile for "FUN-eral"?

17:22.330 --> 17:23.576
All right, well, thanks for coming.

17:23.580 --> 17:25.482
If you need anything...
cooking, cleaning.

17:25.551 --> 17:27.717
You need help with his will?
I don't know anything about wills,

17:27.722 --> 17:29.708
but I'm willing to
take an online course.

17:29.714 --> 17:32.755
That's, uh,... Hey, guys.

17:32.761 --> 17:34.575
Hi. - KEVIN:
Hey. - Randall.

17:35.318 --> 17:37.021
Come on, let's get started!

17:37.161 --> 17:38.320
(loud pop, all gasp)

17:38.354 --> 17:39.888
- All right.
- Oh...

17:40.036 --> 17:41.202
ALL: Oh...

17:41.208 --> 17:43.224
KEVIN: Those aren't coming back.

17:43.521 --> 17:45.897
TESS: Grandpa said we're
supposed to celebrate his life

17:45.903 --> 17:48.129
and not be sad,
so today we're going to act out

17:48.164 --> 17:49.597
William's perfect day.

17:49.632 --> 17:51.866
Starting with breakfast.
He loved breakfast.

17:51.901 --> 17:53.146
Please help yourselves.

17:53.152 --> 17:55.060
ANNIE: And remember to take his pills.

17:56.072 --> 17:57.038
They're just M&M'S.

17:57.073 --> 17:59.207
You sure you don't
have anything stronger?

17:59.241 --> 18:01.643
I want all the toppings.
Are toppings disrespectful?

18:01.677 --> 18:03.200
- Top away. Go ahead.
- All right.

18:03.594 --> 18:05.509
<i>MAN (on TV): There were more
than a few people on the streets</i>

18:05.514 --> 18:08.271
<i>as the archdiocese of Philadelphia... </i>

18:08.276 --> 18:09.317
(switches channel)

18:09.318 --> 18:10.614
<i>What are you suddenly being sore about?</i>

18:10.619 --> 18:12.161
<i>WOMAN: What did you expect me to be?</i>

18:13.420 --> 18:14.954
<i>Do you think women live</i>

18:14.988 --> 18:16.694
<i>in vacuum-sealed containers,
like tennis balls?</i>

18:16.699 --> 18:18.966
<i>MAN: I just thought you
were different, that's all.</i>

18:20.455 --> 18:22.256
<i>WOMAN: Get smart. There hasn't been</i>

18:22.262 --> 18:23.592
<i>a woman in love different since Eve.</i>

18:23.597 --> 18:24.597

- (turns TV off)

18:30.905 --> 18:32.318
(rock music playing)

18:37.716 --> 18:39.817
Hey, Pearson! You made it!

18:39.851 --> 18:41.618
- (man laughs)
- Hey.

18:41.653 --> 18:43.020
Now, this is a first.

18:43.054 --> 18:44.254
Bring it in, come on.

18:44.289 --> 18:45.255
JACK: Yep.

18:45.290 --> 18:46.751
- All right.
- Okay.

18:46.757 --> 18:48.618
- Hey, Jack.
- Heather.

18:48.813 --> 18:50.055
Can I get you a drink?

18:51.790 --> 18:53.797
- Beer.
- Coming right up.

19:00.200 --> 19:02.509
Baby, I think I figured out this toast.

19:06.025 --> 19:07.063
Baby?

19:07.719 --> 19:09.821
I refilled all his pills.

19:13.250 --> 19:15.016
He knew he wasn't coming back.

19:17.026 --> 19:18.230
I didn't know.

19:19.338 --> 19:20.766
How could I have known?

19:22.540 --> 19:24.219
You got your trip to Memphis.

19:24.225 --> 19:25.587
The girls got their memorial.

19:25.593 --> 19:27.102
He left you all with a way...

19:32.064 --> 19:33.657
I loved him, too, Randall.

19:39.616 --> 19:41.641
I never even got a
chance to say good-bye.

19:41.647 --> 19:42.647
Honey...

19:47.117 --> 19:48.218
Come on people!

19:48.233 --> 19:49.552
It's toast time!

19:50.921 --> 19:52.577
MIGUEL: Thank you, my dear.

19:52.583 --> 19:54.335
- What is this?
- It's a Blue Hawaiian.

19:54.341 --> 19:56.076
- Oh, is that William's favorite drink?
- No.

19:56.081 --> 19:58.452
I think the girls misunderstood
a conversation that we had.

19:58.461 --> 20:00.155
<i>Blue Hawaii</i> his favorite movie?

20:00.687 --> 20:02.179
It's his favorite strain of weed.

20:02.185 --> 20:03.938
RANDALL (clears throat):
Attention, everyone.

20:03.943 --> 20:07.726
I guess I'm kind of breaking
the rules by speaking today,

20:07.732 --> 20:12.132
as William didn't ask
me to say anything.

20:12.320 --> 20:16.101
He was a master of words,
and he knew I was no poet.

20:16.163 --> 20:20.218
But I think the real reason
why he didn't ask me to speak

20:22.083 --> 20:24.151
was that he knew there
was someone else who was

20:24.157 --> 20:26.640
much more deserving of this mic than me.

20:29.258 --> 20:31.148
The person who was in it with him,

20:32.515 --> 20:34.327
like, really in it,

20:35.405 --> 20:36.554
every single day.

20:51.893 --> 20:54.546
I really don't know what
to say actually because...

20:56.321 --> 20:57.780
I'm pretty mad at him.

21:00.482 --> 21:02.093
For leaving, I guess.

21:08.084 --> 21:09.725
Hoo. (clears throat)

21:10.611 --> 21:12.249
William was a lot of things.

21:12.713 --> 21:15.554
He was... a father,

21:16.748 --> 21:17.983
an artist,

21:19.187 --> 21:21.562
a cheater at every card game.

21:23.971 --> 21:25.438
God, he was my friend.

21:30.935 --> 21:33.694
I can look all over this house and...

21:34.095 --> 21:36.101
see the memories that we shared.

21:37.997 --> 21:40.616
Every time I walk past the
bathroom, I can hear him humming

21:40.674 --> 21:42.208
when he brushed his teeth.

21:42.671 --> 21:44.655
At first it used to grate on me.

21:44.661 --> 21:46.671
Like, "You love your
dental hygiene, we get it."

21:47.358 --> 21:48.398
But...

21:49.687 --> 21:51.694
pretty soon I came to expect it.

21:54.295 --> 21:55.976
Y'all know that he could dance?

21:56.702 --> 21:57.757
Right there,

21:57.763 --> 22:00.554
right where Randall is standing,

22:00.560 --> 22:01.812
is where he showed me

22:01.818 --> 22:04.366
that even a frail old
bag of bones, his words,

22:04.470 --> 22:06.638
could still attempt a Charleston.

22:06.938 --> 22:07.938
(soft chuckle)

22:10.023 --> 22:13.155
William's moves weren't... fast,

22:13.358 --> 22:16.586
but... they were endearing as hell.

22:19.625 --> 22:23.398
(voice breaking): He
was endearing as hell.

22:25.711 --> 22:28.258
And even though we only
had him for a few months,

22:28.898 --> 22:31.875
he's part of our fabric now.

22:34.726 --> 22:38.593
We'll remember things
as "before William"

22:39.843 --> 22:41.195
and "after William."

22:54.067 --> 22:55.501
TOBY: Hey, Kate.

22:55.765 --> 22:56.914
Come here, talk to me.

22:56.920 --> 22:59.304
(crying): Please, just not now.

22:59.310 --> 23:00.414
(sobbing)

23:06.337 --> 23:07.337
(door opens)

23:07.449 --> 23:09.054
Toby, don't.

23:11.164 --> 23:12.500
Just don't.

23:18.162 --> 23:19.914
I'm sorry.

23:20.523 --> 23:22.687
I know I should be comforting you.

23:22.693 --> 23:23.726
It's okay.

23:23.983 --> 23:26.666
You know, ever since... that camp

23:26.672 --> 23:29.133
just, like, broke me open,

23:30.453 --> 23:31.773
and all that therapy,

23:32.054 --> 23:36.422
and just all this stuff
is coming up about Dad.

23:36.428 --> 23:37.593
Shh.

23:37.749 --> 23:40.101
- It's okay.
- I'm so sorry

23:40.107 --> 23:41.789
that you had to go through this twice.

23:41.795 --> 23:43.353
I'm so sorry, Randall.

23:43.359 --> 23:46.343
Kate, hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey.

23:48.610 --> 23:50.258
I'm okay.

23:50.388 --> 23:51.531
It's...

23:54.604 --> 23:56.471
Had a dream last night

23:57.068 --> 23:58.562
<i>that Dad and William met.</i>

23:59.125 --> 24:02.031
<i>I walked into the living room, and, uh,</i>

24:02.037 --> 24:03.515
(Jack and William laughing)

24:03.521 --> 24:06.054
<i>just talking and laughing
like old friends.</i>

24:07.914 --> 24:09.610
<i>And William was telling
Dad how I taught him</i>

24:09.615 --> 24:11.145
- <i>how to drive a car.</i>
- <i>... teach me how to drive.</i>

24:11.150 --> 24:12.955
- Whoa, wait, wait.
- <i>And dad was like... </i>

24:12.961 --> 24:15.014
- Really? Randall?
- <i>Really? Randall?</i>

24:15.048 --> 24:17.431
JACK: (laughs) Did he
tell you about the time

24:17.437 --> 24:18.725
that I taught him how to drive?

24:18.731 --> 24:19.790
No, no, you've got
to tell me this, Jack.

24:19.795 --> 24:22.514
I got all three kids
in the driveway there.

24:22.520 --> 24:24.750
Randall hops in the car, excited...

24:24.949 --> 24:27.312
RANDALL: <i>"Oh, the kid
just threw it in reverse</i>

24:27.318 --> 24:28.586
<i>"and zoomed straight back</i>

24:28.592 --> 24:30.352
- like a bat out of hell."
- Bat out of hell.

24:30.402 --> 24:31.515
(crying)

24:32.953 --> 24:35.031
Dad loved that story.

24:35.205 --> 24:36.472
He did.

24:39.758 --> 24:42.547
I'm not the guy to tell you
how to handle your feelings.

24:43.320 --> 24:46.453
But I've learned that
you got to let 'em out.

24:47.547 --> 24:49.711
You got to share them with
the people that love you.

24:50.179 --> 24:51.289
I know.

24:51.429 --> 24:52.484
Do you?

24:52.609 --> 24:54.240
'Cause there's a really sweet,

24:54.453 --> 24:56.877
really big guy in my
living room right now

24:56.883 --> 24:58.390
who might think otherwise.

24:59.468 --> 25:00.554
I know.

25:15.008 --> 25:16.125
Where's the family tonight?

25:16.131 --> 25:17.289
Um...

25:17.987 --> 25:18.851
Uh...

25:18.857 --> 25:21.859
kids are with their friends

25:21.928 --> 25:24.250
and wife is out of town.

25:24.530 --> 25:25.656
In Cleveland.

25:25.936 --> 25:27.102
What's in Cleveland?

25:27.108 --> 25:28.312
Oh, she's...

25:29.093 --> 25:30.140
following her dreams.

25:30.146 --> 25:32.367
No one's dreams are in Cleveland.

25:32.373 --> 25:33.398
Well, it's Cleveland,

25:33.632 --> 25:35.093
and then Boston,

25:35.523 --> 25:38.117
then New York, Trenton, Philly.

25:38.123 --> 25:39.609
She's on tour with her Ben.

25:42.418 --> 25:43.885
Her band.

25:43.891 --> 25:46.297
She's in a band, she's
on tour with the band.

25:46.303 --> 25:48.258
Yeah. I knew something was up.

25:52.485 --> 25:53.351
Nothing's up.

25:53.357 --> 25:55.742
Come on, Jack, I see you every day.

25:55.822 --> 25:58.557
You have that look a man
gets when something breaks

25:58.591 --> 25:59.593
and he can't fix it.

26:01.457 --> 26:02.898
♪ So help me, Jesus ♪

26:06.453 --> 26:08.851
Heather, enough, enough.
Enough with this crap.

26:09.049 --> 26:10.148
I'm a married man.

26:11.574 --> 26:14.570
You're embarrassing me, and
you're embarrassing yourself.

26:16.898 --> 26:18.586
I'm gonna make-make a phone call.

26:18.833 --> 26:19.833
(clears throat)

26:22.539 --> 26:24.547
Every morning and afternoon,

26:24.640 --> 26:26.773
Grandpa would put on his old man hat

26:26.779 --> 26:28.946
and walk around the neighborhood.

26:29.004 --> 26:31.039
So now we're gonna go on his walk.

26:31.304 --> 26:33.218
Come on, everyone, get your hats.

26:33.320 --> 26:34.617
TOBY: All right.

26:35.633 --> 26:37.328
ANNIE: Uncle Kevin, Grandma?

26:37.334 --> 26:38.532
- RANDALL: Picking the green one?
- BETH: Yeah.

26:38.537 --> 26:39.453
RANDALL: You gonna do that one?

26:39.537 --> 26:41.945
Daddy, you wear Grandpa's real one.

26:45.771 --> 26:47.390
I don't know, sweetheart.

26:47.396 --> 26:48.563
Put it on, babe.

26:52.407 --> 26:53.908
Yeah.

26:54.279 --> 26:55.279
Mm.

26:59.016 --> 27:01.406
I want to tell you what's
been going on with me.

27:01.823 --> 27:03.734
About... my dad.

27:04.782 --> 27:06.492
So maybe after the show tonight?

27:07.383 --> 27:08.717
KEVIN: Okay, everybody,

27:08.751 --> 27:10.365
this is where I leave
you, it's time for me

27:10.370 --> 27:12.150
- to head to the theater.
- RANDALL: Break a leg, man.

27:12.155 --> 27:13.718
- Thank you. All right.
- Yeah.

27:13.724 --> 27:15.053
- See you in a few hours.
- I know.

27:15.058 --> 27:16.015
Front and center, buddy.

27:16.021 --> 27:17.204
You might have the whole
theater to yourself.

27:17.209 --> 27:18.648
- Bye.
- RANDALL: Peace.

27:21.613 --> 27:22.613
(Rebecca clears throat)

27:31.617 --> 27:34.419
So, William seems to have
really connected with the girls

27:34.453 --> 27:35.920
in a short time.

27:36.328 --> 27:37.343
Yeah.

27:37.820 --> 27:39.211
That's what he did.

27:40.493 --> 27:42.429
With everyone he met, it seems.

27:44.986 --> 27:46.570
You know your father.

27:47.859 --> 27:49.367
Jack, I mean.

27:50.154 --> 27:52.125
He, um... (clears throat)

27:53.825 --> 27:57.804
he taught you a lot
about honesty and courage.

27:59.674 --> 28:02.836
But the truth is, you came
into this world pretty perfect.

28:03.536 --> 28:06.972
You always had this, uh... gentleness,

28:06.978 --> 28:09.179
this inner kindness
to you, from the start,

28:09.185 --> 28:10.383
and I think...

28:12.079 --> 28:13.922
you got that from William.

28:19.515 --> 28:22.123
I really thought I was doing
the right thing for you

28:22.129 --> 28:23.604
- and for our family...
- Mom, you don't have to do this.

28:23.609 --> 28:25.359
I do.
I have to.

28:25.429 --> 28:28.320
I haven't said this to you before.
I need to, okay?

28:34.242 --> 28:35.304
(sighs deeply)

28:37.455 --> 28:41.851
When I first met him, he
was so far gone, Randall.

28:43.406 --> 28:46.914
And then when I saw him again, years
later, he was so much better.

28:48.610 --> 28:50.242
And you got curious.

28:51.139 --> 28:52.726
And I got scared.

28:54.297 --> 28:57.000
I always planned on telling you, I did.

28:57.006 --> 28:59.531
I would set an age in my
mind. I'd say, "When he's 15.

28:59.537 --> 29:01.047
I'm gonna tell him when he's 15."

29:01.053 --> 29:03.875
And 15 would come and
go, and I'd lose my nerve,

29:03.881 --> 29:05.682
and then I would decide on 16.

29:05.688 --> 29:09.320
(voice breaking): Because the
truth is, I was so terrified.

29:11.203 --> 29:14.351
Because I knew it would devastate you.

29:17.660 --> 29:19.617
It was such a big lie.

29:20.231 --> 29:22.359
And such a long lie.

29:23.206 --> 29:24.476
I knew...

29:25.981 --> 29:28.015
I knew that I could lose you over it,

29:28.021 --> 29:30.117
(crying): and I couldn't
lose you, Randall.

29:30.734 --> 29:31.734
I couldn't.

29:34.339 --> 29:36.541
But that is no excuse.

29:36.755 --> 29:38.022
It was...

29:38.796 --> 29:42.086
selfish... and it was wrong.

29:43.341 --> 29:47.156
And I want you to know, from
the bottom of my heart...

29:49.429 --> 29:52.679
... that I am so sorry you
didn't have more time together.

29:52.685 --> 29:54.195
That it is my fault

29:54.201 --> 29:57.070
- you didn't have more time with him.
- I-I got enough. I got enough.

29:58.188 --> 30:00.222
It was enough time to
know that I loved him.

30:00.867 --> 30:01.867
I loved him.

30:03.051 --> 30:04.618
And I know that he loved me.

30:06.140 --> 30:07.312
I'm so glad.

30:08.478 --> 30:09.742
I love you, Mom.

30:11.257 --> 30:12.750
I love you more.

30:12.778 --> 30:16.013
I love you m... no, no, I
mean, I meant what I said,

30:16.019 --> 30:17.352
but I'm a grown-ass man

30:17.358 --> 30:19.101
and this is gonna
cross a very weird line.

30:19.209 --> 30:20.336
(both laugh)

30:22.032 --> 30:23.116
Fair enough.

30:27.718 --> 30:29.547
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

30:30.696 --> 30:31.781
It's okay.

30:36.906 --> 30:38.758
I-D-I-D-I-D-I-D... Hey!

30:39.218 --> 30:41.033
Hey, uh, I was just curious,

30:41.039 --> 30:42.373
if Brandon Novak picked up his ticket?

30:42.378 --> 30:44.062
- I'll check.
- Thank you.

30:45.812 --> 30:46.881
Yeah, we'll see.

30:46.916 --> 30:48.015
Okay.

30:48.217 --> 30:49.273
(sighs)

30:49.570 --> 30:50.953
Just need to meditate.

30:52.695 --> 30:55.789
I want to see <i>Wicked</i>
tonight, am I in the right theater?

30:56.515 --> 30:57.570
Hey.

30:58.523 --> 31:00.820
Yeah, yes. Yes, you are,

31:00.976 --> 31:02.426
as a matter of fact,
in the right theater.

31:02.431 --> 31:03.471
Come over here and kiss me

31:03.499 --> 31:05.220
- before I paint my face green.
- (chuckles)

31:07.136 --> 31:09.297
Mmm. What are you doing back here?

31:09.304 --> 31:11.306
I'm sorry, am I destroying your focus?

31:11.340 --> 31:13.258
No. No, no, no, this is great.

31:13.562 --> 31:15.601
Okay, just came to give you this.

31:17.227 --> 31:18.570
It's what I always wanted.

31:18.576 --> 31:20.086
- It's a crutch.
- I know what it is.

31:20.092 --> 31:21.508
For when you break your leg.

31:21.514 --> 31:23.804
Break a leg, okay. Yeah. Ha!

31:23.810 --> 31:25.626
Well, the E.R. staff
thought it was hysterical.

31:25.631 --> 31:28.234
Well, thank you... very much,

31:28.538 --> 31:30.290
for sneaking back here;
it means a lot to me.

31:30.295 --> 31:31.695

Babe, it's 10:00 p.m.

33:24.283 --> 33:26.339
Yeah, they're all still there.

There's just something
I got to take care of.

33:38.425 --> 33:40.214
Randall, thank God.

33:40.220 --> 33:41.715
Ten years, Tyler.

33:42.603 --> 33:44.246
I've worked here for ten years.

33:45.799 --> 33:48.200
I've brought in 80% of our clients.

33:48.641 --> 33:51.643
I grew this company
from a six-man operation

33:51.649 --> 33:53.605
into a 60-person machine.

33:54.519 --> 33:56.886
I've given you
20-hour days, man.

33:57.597 --> 34:01.449
Like, nights away from
my wife and children.

34:03.426 --> 34:05.441
My father died, man.

34:06.563 --> 34:08.386
And on the day of his memorial,

34:08.391 --> 34:10.847
you sent me pears, which...

34:11.358 --> 34:14.737
I'm allergic to. And you know this.

34:15.081 --> 34:17.261
Because at the lunch where you hired me,

34:17.266 --> 34:19.775
we ate Roquefort Salad and I
went into anaphylactic shock.

34:19.809 --> 34:21.353
- Randall...
- And along with the pears

34:21.360 --> 34:23.635
that could have killed
me, you sent a card

34:24.112 --> 34:28.449
with a one-line Hallmark message
and a typed-out signature:

34:28.900 --> 34:31.308
"From the team."

34:33.706 --> 34:36.753
And for all this, Tyler, I thank you.

34:37.327 --> 34:40.230
You see, for days, I've been
plagued by this question:

34:40.272 --> 34:42.964
How do I honor my father's legacy?

34:44.400 --> 34:47.735
Then I realized, I honor it
by taking what I've learned

34:47.770 --> 34:50.272
from how he lived his life
and having it shape the way

34:50.306 --> 34:53.347
I go on living mine. And
so, here it is, Tyler.

34:53.514 --> 34:54.768
Um...

34:55.800 --> 34:56.792
I quit.

34:56.797 --> 34:58.589
- Hold on.
- No hard feelings, man.

34:58.875 --> 35:00.509
I walk out of here in triumph.

35:02.256 --> 35:04.878
I came, I saw...

35:06.533 --> 35:07.636
I conquered.

35:10.009 --> 35:11.128
Sanjay...

35:11.974 --> 35:13.425
it's all you now, brother.

35:14.970 --> 35:16.019
Peace.

35:18.792 --> 35:20.496
TYLER: What are you gonna do?

35:31.320 --> 35:32.331
I don't know.

35:33.196 --> 35:35.660
Maybe instead of running in
the morning, I'll go for a walk.

35:36.916 --> 35:38.277
Slow it down a little.

35:39.807 --> 35:41.206
Talk to my mailman.

35:43.121 --> 35:45.378
That seems like a good
way to start the day.

35:59.185 --> 36:00.185
Does it hurt?

36:01.392 --> 36:02.392
Your leg.

36:03.289 --> 36:05.023
You broke the hell out of that leg.

36:05.182 --> 36:06.383
Did I?

36:06.449 --> 36:07.503
You know you did.

36:07.769 --> 36:09.573
- I know I did.
- (laughs)

36:11.732 --> 36:14.519
So... Novak?

36:14.798 --> 36:17.394
Oh, yeah, Novak was a no-show.

36:17.400 --> 36:18.275
Oh...

36:18.296 --> 36:20.566
Yeah, it doesn't matter. You know?

36:22.131 --> 36:24.331
Yeah, but you've been
talking about it for days.

36:24.636 --> 36:25.967
It's because I thought

36:26.002 --> 36:28.402
the play was the only thing
that mattered. You know?

36:28.445 --> 36:30.980
I looked out at that crowd
tonight, I saw that empty seat.

36:31.374 --> 36:32.692
It made me sad, I'm
not gonna lie to you.

36:32.697 --> 36:34.598
But then I saw the other seats.

36:34.604 --> 36:36.410
You know, I saw my family and...

36:36.812 --> 36:39.042
I saw you all the way
back there and I realized

36:39.048 --> 36:40.848
I didn't come to New
York to be in a hit play.

36:41.253 --> 36:44.246
I came to New York to win back my girl.

36:44.821 --> 36:49.124
My girl who would drag a
crutch all the way across town

36:49.158 --> 36:51.003
after a 12-hour shift
for a stupid joke.

36:51.194 --> 36:52.660
- 14-hour shift.
- Okay.

36:52.666 --> 36:53.667
Great joke.

36:59.073 --> 37:01.066
I'm not messing things
up with you again.

37:01.898 --> 37:04.956
And however long it takes for
me to convince you of that, I...

37:07.248 --> 37:08.331
I'll just wait.

37:11.247 --> 37:12.941
I came here for you, Sophie.

37:27.561 --> 37:28.886
(Sophie gasps)

37:35.299 --> 37:36.418
Is everything all right? You okay?

37:36.423 --> 37:37.464
Yeah, yeah,

37:37.792 --> 37:39.028
I'm just looking for weird moles.

37:39.033 --> 37:39.894

niece is visiting us,

39:09.548 --> 39:11.456
and against my better judgment,

39:11.462 --> 39:14.644
we decided to take her to
this... this little play

39:14.744 --> 39:18.683
because it starred her favorite
actor in the world, The Manny.

39:19.660 --> 39:20.699

wasn't too much trouble
