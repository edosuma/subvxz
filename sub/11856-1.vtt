"Always On My Mind"

00:34.333 --> 00:36.333
[sighs]
Congratulations, Jimmy.

00:36.417 --> 00:38.000
Hey, Mr. Wyatt, thanks.

00:38.083 --> 00:40.959
Even though you tanked my
final,
you held onto your "B."

00:41.041 --> 00:43.959
Well, I've had a lot
of stuff on my mind.

00:44.041 --> 00:45.959
Math kind
of took a backseat.

00:46.041 --> 00:48.750
Jimmy! You haven't
signed my yearbook yet.

00:48.834 --> 00:52.000
- I'll do it later.
- I'm saving page 26 for you.

00:52.083 --> 00:55.792
There's a candid of us
in chemistry lab.

00:55.875 --> 00:58.333
We have our goggles on, but you
can definitely tell it's us.

00:58.417 --> 01:00.083
Yeah? Cool.

01:00.166 --> 01:02.208
Hey, Jimmy!
What do you say, huh?

01:02.291 --> 01:04.291
Coach. You look weird
in a suit.

01:04.375 --> 01:06.667
Hey, tell me about it.
I feel like I'm at a
funeral.

01:06.750 --> 01:09.709
And I am, in a way,
losing my star
runner.

01:09.792 --> 01:12.208
My loss, Villanova's
gain, right?

01:12.291 --> 01:13.625
Excuse me, Coach.

01:21.875 --> 01:24.959
- Quinn.
- It's time.

03:29.417 --> 03:30.500
Hi.

03:30.583 --> 03:33.291
Hi. You got a lighter?

03:33.375 --> 03:34.792
Can't smoke in here.

03:36.875 --> 03:38.125
- Morning.
- Hey, Lil.

03:38.208 --> 03:39.959
You know Lindsey Dunlay,
Child Services?

03:40.041 --> 03:43.375
[chuckles]
Since tenth grade.

03:43.458 --> 03:44.542
Is she one of yours?

03:44.625 --> 03:46.542
Yeah.
Claire Tate,
17.

03:46.625 --> 03:50.333
Knows everything,
hates everyone. Great
kid.

03:50.417 --> 03:52.333
Her dad was killed in 1988.

03:52.417 --> 03:54.041
Grad night. Adams High.

03:54.125 --> 03:56.041
- Was he a teacher?
- A student.

03:56.125 --> 03:59.000
His girlfriend was pregnant.
Had the baby that night.

03:59.083 --> 04:00.917
Which, in the
wisdom
of teenagers

04:01.000 --> 04:03.792
they left
in a trash
can.

04:03.875 --> 04:05.417
Claire was that baby?

04:05.500 --> 04:07.417
(Stillman)
'Jimmy was hit by a
car that same night.'

04:07.500 --> 04:09.583
- They never found the
driver.
- We got a new direction?

04:09.667 --> 04:12.166
Claire was approached
by a man yesterday

04:12.250 --> 04:13.667
talking about his murder.

04:13.750 --> 04:15.500
Can I smoke
on that
balcony?

04:15.583 --> 04:17.875
Answer a few questions first.

04:17.959 --> 04:20.375
Can you describe
the guy you met, Claire?

04:20.458 --> 04:22.792
He was old.
He drove a white
van.

04:22.875 --> 04:25.166
Old like 30
or old like 60?

04:25.250 --> 04:26.333
In between.

04:26.417 --> 04:28.333
- And this was at your school?
- Yeah.

04:28.417 --> 04:30.834
He pulls up,
wants to talk to me.

04:30.917 --> 04:32.417
Says, "I know who killed Jimmy."

04:32.500 --> 04:33.583
Meaning your dad.

04:33.667 --> 04:35.959
But when I said
that, he says

04:36.041 --> 04:39.333
"Jimmy wasn't your dad. I was."

04:39.417 --> 04:41.667
Did you get a name,
Claire? A license plate?

04:41.750 --> 04:45.208
One of the teachers came out
and chased him away.

04:45.291 --> 04:47.166
He was probably lying.

04:47.250 --> 04:48.667
We'll find out.

04:48.750 --> 04:51.000
- Can I go smoke now?
- You shouldn't.

04:51.083 --> 04:53.417
Who you going to
tell?
My parents?

04:57.417 --> 04:58.750
- Got an edge, huh?
- Yeah.

04:58.834 --> 05:01.166
Seventeen years in
foster
care will do that.

05:01.250 --> 05:04.500
We'll have uniforms in the
area
watch out for a white van.

05:05.792 --> 05:07.458
There was one more thing.

05:07.542 --> 05:09.333
What's that?

05:09.417 --> 05:10.667
Before he drove off

05:10.750 --> 05:14.000
he said he'd be
coming back for me.

05:52.250 --> 05:54.166
Read about
George's burial?

05:54.250 --> 05:55.667
No one there
but the grave diggers.

05:55.750 --> 05:58.583
Ask me, Potter's Field
is too good for his
bones.

05:58.667 --> 06:01.500
So did you guys
hear about the parachuter?

06:01.583 --> 06:03.375
No.

06:03.458 --> 06:04.625
Sutton.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.125
You going to elaborate?

06:08.208 --> 06:09.959
A girl, coming to Homicide.

06:10.041 --> 06:12.083
Parachuting in
from Northeast Detectives.

06:12.166 --> 06:14.667
- What's her inside drag?
- Dad was Tommy Sutton.

06:14.750 --> 06:16.291
- Died on the job.
- Eighty one.

06:16.375 --> 06:17.959
- Shot in a traffic stop.
- Yeah.

06:18.041 --> 06:20.000
So who's going to say no
to a fallen hero's daughter

06:20.083 --> 06:21.375
wanting to come to Homicide?

06:21.458 --> 06:23.333
Gil Sherman worked Northeast.
Maybe he knows her.

06:23.417 --> 06:27.500
I already asked.
Said she's a looker.

06:27.583 --> 06:29.291
Can't hold that against her.

06:29.375 --> 06:30.792
You can if she throws it around.

06:30.875 --> 06:32.959
Who says she does that?

06:33.041 --> 06:36.333
Word I hear,
some type of scandal

06:36.417 --> 06:38.417
involving her sergeant.

06:38.500 --> 06:40.250
Sexual nature.

06:40.333 --> 06:42.625
That's ill-advised.

06:42.709 --> 06:45.083
I got a sixth sense on this.

06:45.166 --> 06:47.208
This girl's going to be trouble.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.834
Jimmy Tate, 18.

06:53.917 --> 06:56.834
Graduated June 11, 1988.

06:56.917 --> 06:58.250
Killed outside
the school that night.

06:58.333 --> 06:59.500
(Stillman)
'Hit and run.'

06:59.583 --> 07:01.000
Theory was some
drunk kid did it.

07:01.083 --> 07:02.291
Never came forward.

07:02.375 --> 07:03.583
Jimmy's girlfriend

07:03.667 --> 07:05.792
Quinn Ellis, gave birth
at the party that night

07:05.875 --> 07:07.875
then left the baby
in a trash bin.

07:07.959 --> 07:09.959
'Did two years for
reckless endangerment.'

07:10.041 --> 07:11.500
Lost custody,
never bounced back.

07:11.583 --> 07:13.583
She's been in and out
of trouble ever since.

07:13.667 --> 07:15.709
Lives in a halfway house
in Fairmont.

07:15.792 --> 07:18.083
- Was she a suspect?
- No license, no car.

07:18.166 --> 07:19.458
She was picked up
a few hours later

07:19.542 --> 07:21.333
walking along the parkway
in a daze.

07:21.417 --> 07:23.250
A partial tire
impression at the
scene

07:23.333 --> 07:25.667
was ID'd as a
Firestone,
new tread.

07:25.750 --> 07:29.542
A fairly common brand,
but it's something.

07:29.625 --> 07:33.125
So who's this guy coming around
now telling Claire he's her dad?

07:33.208 --> 07:35.542
Maybe just a crank. Someone
wants to mess with her mind.

07:35.625 --> 07:39.333
As if being thrown away
by her parents didn't do
that.

07:49.458 --> 07:53.083
I do needlepoint 'cause
I don't know how to knit.

07:53.166 --> 07:54.208
Me neither.

07:54.291 --> 07:55.750
I'm not too good with skills.

07:55.834 --> 07:59.208
So, Quinn, we're looking
back into Jimmy's
hit-and-run.

08:01.500 --> 08:03.291
That night just about sunk me.

08:03.375 --> 08:04.500
Losing Jimmy?

08:04.583 --> 08:05.542
And the baby.

08:05.625 --> 08:08.041
Yeah, but losing
her
was voluntary.

08:08.125 --> 08:10.208
It was a bad decision.

08:11.458 --> 08:13.875
Tell us about it.

08:13.959 --> 08:15.792
Well, I had her
in a stall

08:15.875 --> 08:17.667
in the girl's bathroom.

08:17.750 --> 08:20.000
Tough place
to give
birth?

08:20.083 --> 08:23.291
You know what though?
It wasn't too bad.

08:23.375 --> 08:26.750
It wasn't easy or anything,
but I handled it.

08:26.834 --> 08:29.000
So why ditch her in the trash?

08:29.083 --> 08:33.041
I was 18...
and dumb.

08:33.125 --> 08:36.166
Just couldn't think
of anything else right then.

08:36.250 --> 08:37.583
And Jimmy was..?

08:37.667 --> 08:40.750
Gone. Right after she was born.

08:40.834 --> 08:43.750
Quinn, Claire was approached
yesterday by a guy that
claimed

08:43.834 --> 08:45.792
he's her dad.

08:45.875 --> 08:47.875
That's crazy.

08:47.959 --> 08:50.208
That's mean and crazy.

08:50.291 --> 08:51.583
Anyone you can think
of would say that?

08:51.667 --> 08:55.250
No. Jimmy was my one and only.

08:55.333 --> 08:59.250
To this day, he was the best
thing that ever happened to
me.

08:59.333 --> 09:01.834
So how did it go wrong?

09:01.917 --> 09:04.333
Getting pregnant messed us up.

09:07.542 --> 09:11.333
Sine, opposite over hypotenuse.

09:11.417 --> 09:16.750
Cosine, adjacent
over hypotenuse.

09:16.834 --> 09:18.792
Can you meet
me tonight?

09:18.875 --> 09:20.917
No. My parents.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.041
(Wyatt)
'Jimmy!'

09:22.125 --> 09:23.417
Quinn!

09:23.500 --> 09:25.542
My way or the hallway.

09:38.125 --> 09:40.333
Dork, huh?

09:41.875 --> 09:44.125
Hey, what's wrong?

09:44.208 --> 09:45.291
Nothing.

09:45.375 --> 09:47.667
Don't tell me nothing.
You're crying.

09:47.750 --> 09:49.834
I'm scared you'll hate me.

09:49.917 --> 09:51.333
Quinn.

09:54.583 --> 09:57.875
You know how I haven't
been feeling that good?

09:59.667 --> 10:02.583
Well, it turns out
I'm pregnant.

10:07.709 --> 10:09.834
Are you sure?

10:09.917 --> 10:10.834
Yeah.

10:10.917 --> 10:12.458
Did you take
one of
those..?

10:12.542 --> 10:14.917
Home tests? Yeah.

10:16.709 --> 10:18.709
It was blue.

10:18.792 --> 10:21.917
It was just that one weekend.

10:23.375 --> 10:26.333
We need to fix it.

10:26.417 --> 10:28.041
Yeah.

10:29.083 --> 10:30.709
We'll take care of it.

10:39.166 --> 10:43.375
But we didn't really
take care of it.

10:43.458 --> 10:45.792
Time got away from us

10:45.875 --> 10:47.291
and we had her.

10:47.375 --> 10:51.875
Well, how about leaving
her
at a hospital? A church?

10:51.959 --> 10:54.542
That would have been better.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.291
Yeah, I found that baby.

11:10.375 --> 11:11.583
It was a head trip.

11:11.667 --> 11:13.417
So, how did you
happen to be
looking

11:13.500 --> 11:15.417
in the trash that night?

11:15.500 --> 11:17.917
I was drunk,
weaving down the hall

11:18.000 --> 11:21.041
and there was this cry
from the closet.

11:21.125 --> 11:23.250
I thought I was hearing things.

11:23.333 --> 11:26.709
But, no, it was
a real live baby.

11:26.792 --> 11:28.417
(Jeffries)
'See anyone around?'

11:28.500 --> 11:30.834
I ran back to the
party,
told everyone.

11:30.917 --> 11:33.542
Got around real quick
it was Jimmy and
Quinn's.

11:33.625 --> 11:35.000
Did people know
Quinn was pregnant?

11:35.083 --> 11:37.959
No. Well, most people, anyway.

11:38.041 --> 11:39.500
(Jeffries)
'But you did?'

11:39.583 --> 11:42.834
Well, I happened to be
in the nurse's office one day

11:42.917 --> 11:44.875
when Jimmy came in.

11:51.166 --> 11:52.583
Jimmy.

11:56.208 --> 11:57.667
That ankle
acting up?

11:57.750 --> 11:59.959
Uh, no. It's better.

12:00.041 --> 12:01.792
So, what can I do for you?

12:01.875 --> 12:03.417
Well, um..

12:03.500 --> 12:06.709
I'm in a situation
with my girlfriend.

12:06.792 --> 12:08.125
(Laura)
'Yes?'

12:08.208 --> 12:10.959
She's, uh...you know

12:11.041 --> 12:12.250
pregnant.

12:12.333 --> 12:14.291
Oh.

12:14.375 --> 12:16.834
I borrowed some money.
Two hundred dollars.

12:16.917 --> 12:20.709
We want to...take care of it.

12:20.792 --> 12:25.458
I just don't know
where...to go.

12:25.542 --> 12:27.542
I see.

12:27.625 --> 12:30.834
Well, first of all

12:30.917 --> 12:33.750
it costs more like 900 dollars.

12:34.875 --> 12:36.000
Oh.

12:36.083 --> 12:38.417
And you'd both
need parental consent.

12:38.500 --> 12:40.333
We can't.

12:40.417 --> 12:43.500
And...you know

12:43.583 --> 12:46.291
Quinn would never be able
to have children again.

12:46.375 --> 12:48.875
No. I...I didn't know that.

12:48.959 --> 12:51.834
'I have some photos
you should see.'

13:01.917 --> 13:07.709
Can you imagine having
your legs and arms broken

13:07.792 --> 13:10.500
and then suctioned away?

13:10.583 --> 13:11.458
Huh?

13:11.542 --> 13:14.417
You'd probably scream.

13:14.500 --> 13:16.709
Just like the babies do.

13:20.667 --> 13:21.959
I thought if..

13:22.041 --> 13:24.375
...it was early, it was easy.

13:28.250 --> 13:30.291
Murder isn't easy.

13:30.375 --> 13:32.250
Huh..

13:32.333 --> 13:34.458
Well..

13:34.542 --> 13:36.542
I guess..

13:38.125 --> 13:40.500
Thanks, Nurse Laura.

13:44.375 --> 13:47.083
So, this nurse
had an agenda.

13:47.166 --> 13:49.250
Nut job.

13:49.333 --> 13:51.375
Jimmy come from money?

13:51.458 --> 13:52.583
His dad left them early.

13:52.667 --> 13:55.333
Mom was a sometimes waitress.

13:55.417 --> 13:58.583
So, how do you figure
he got the 200 bucks?

13:58.667 --> 14:01.166
Hmm, he was on the track team.

14:01.250 --> 14:05.750
Had kind of an extra
close
relationship with the
coach.

14:05.834 --> 14:08.208
(Vera)
'You got a name?'

14:08.291 --> 14:10.041
Bruce..

14:10.834 --> 14:12.000
Something.

14:13.583 --> 14:15.834
You know, I could
find it in my yearbook.

14:15.917 --> 14:17.792
Call you.

14:19.500 --> 14:20.834
It turns out
this school
nurse

14:20.917 --> 14:23.583
was big into
Operation Choose Life in
'88.

14:23.667 --> 14:24.792
And built up a sheet doing it.

14:24.875 --> 14:26.125
Laura Graham, three arrests.

14:26.208 --> 14:28.542
'86, assaulted a patient
going into a clinic.

14:28.625 --> 14:30.625
Same year, broke windows
at a doctor's office.

14:30.709 --> 14:32.458
Strange extracurriculars
for a school nurse.

14:32.542 --> 14:36.000
And my personal favorite,
1987,
ran a doctor off the road

14:36.083 --> 14:38.375
after his shift
at a woman's health center.

14:38.458 --> 14:40.500
In her Caddy Cimarron.

14:40.583 --> 14:42.750
Firestone tires?

14:42.834 --> 14:45.667
Just like the car
that killed Jimmy.

14:54.125 --> 14:55.875
Lieutenant Stillman?

14:55.959 --> 14:57.625
I'm Josie Sutton.

14:57.709 --> 14:59.333
- Nice to meet you.
- You, too.

14:59.417 --> 15:01.792
I'm really glad to be here.

15:01.875 --> 15:03.583
I knew your dad.

15:03.667 --> 15:05.792
I was at his funeral.

15:05.875 --> 15:09.500
All I remember about the
funeral
were the gunshots.

15:09.583 --> 15:11.625
They scared me, and..

15:11.709 --> 15:14.834
...in retrospect,
seem kind of inappropriate.

15:15.792 --> 15:17.375
Sit down.

15:22.834 --> 15:25.875
How'd you like
it
at Northeast?

15:25.959 --> 15:28.583
It was fine.

15:29.709 --> 15:31.417
Look, I'm sure
you know the rumors

15:31.500 --> 15:33.834
going around about
Sergeant White and you.

15:33.917 --> 15:34.834
Yeah.

15:34.917 --> 15:35.834
Now, I don't need

15:35.917 --> 15:37.083
to know what happened.

15:37.166 --> 15:38.166
No.

15:38.250 --> 15:39.709
I just don't want trouble here.

15:39.792 --> 15:41.792
Me neither.

15:41.875 --> 15:44.333
Fair enough.

15:44.417 --> 15:45.750
Hey, boss.

15:45.834 --> 15:47.625
Scotty Valens.
Detective
Sutton.

15:47.709 --> 15:48.959
Hi. Josie.

15:49.041 --> 15:51.417
- Uh, from Northeast?
- Yeah.

15:51.500 --> 15:52.667
Yeah, we heard you were coming.

15:52.750 --> 15:55.709
Uh...congratulations.

15:55.792 --> 15:56.792
Thanks.

15:56.875 --> 15:58.333
Did you find
that track
coach?

15:58.417 --> 16:01.083
Wasn't at his last known.
Guess his wife tossed him.

16:01.166 --> 16:03.000
Going to his workplace now.

16:03.083 --> 16:05.250
Why don't you take
Sutton with you?

16:06.500 --> 16:08.625
Yeah. Sure.

16:13.458 --> 16:14.875
(Rush)
'So, two scared kids'

16:14.959 --> 16:15.959
want to end
their pregnancy.

16:16.041 --> 16:19.083
But you had other plans
for them.

16:19.166 --> 16:20.500
I counseled Jimmy.

16:20.583 --> 16:22.417
No, you lied to him.

16:22.500 --> 16:23.917
You showed him gruesome photos.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.500
I thought he should see what
they do at the killing mills.

16:26.583 --> 16:29.000
Oh, bite me.

16:29.083 --> 16:30.834
(Rush)
'We hear Quinn never
looked pregnant.'

16:30.917 --> 16:32.125
'Maybe, by June,
you thought they'd gone'

16:32.208 --> 16:33.250
'against your advice.'

16:33.333 --> 16:34.458
No.

16:34.542 --> 16:35.709
Maybe now you wanted
to punish Jimmy?

16:35.792 --> 16:36.792
And we know your Cadillac's

16:36.875 --> 16:39.041
your weapon of choice.

16:39.125 --> 16:40.709
I got through to Jimmy.

16:40.792 --> 16:41.875
Right after the holidays

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
he asked for the name
of an obstetrician.

16:45.083 --> 16:50.083
So, you see, there was
no need for punishment.

16:50.750 --> 16:52.667
Excuse me.

16:56.166 --> 16:59.709
Claire, don't you
have school right
now?

16:59.792 --> 17:01.750
Just American History.
Who cares?

17:01.834 --> 17:03.375
You want your diploma, Claire.

17:03.458 --> 17:05.500
I don't like school.

17:07.500 --> 17:08.834
So why are you here?

17:08.917 --> 17:10.458
He came back.

17:10.542 --> 17:11.667
The guy in the van?

17:11.750 --> 17:13.250
Yeah, asked me to go with him.

17:13.333 --> 17:15.291
You get a good
look this time?

17:15.375 --> 17:17.291
Yeah. We talked.

17:17.375 --> 17:19.083
Said we should have dinner,
father-daughter.

17:19.166 --> 17:20.375
Claire, he could be dangerous.

17:20.458 --> 17:21.333
He was nice.

17:21.417 --> 17:22.583
Well, I need to talk to him.

17:22.667 --> 17:25.208
- Did you get a name?
- No.

17:27.667 --> 17:29.917
Look, I saw your mom yesterday.

17:31.500 --> 17:32.667
So?

17:35.166 --> 17:37.500
She asked about you.

17:37.583 --> 17:40.083
Why do I care?

17:40.166 --> 17:42.208
She'd like to see you, Claire.

17:42.291 --> 17:44.667
No, thanks.

17:52.625 --> 17:54.583
- Bruce Johnson.
- Yeah?

17:54.667 --> 17:56.709
We're here to talk to you
about Jimmy Tate.

17:56.792 --> 17:57.792
Jimmy Tate?

17:57.875 --> 17:59.166
Great kid,
personality
plus.

17:59.250 --> 18:00.917
We hear you were kind
of a father figure to him.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.500
Yeah. Yeah, I was.

18:02.583 --> 18:04.250
He didn't have a real dad
and his mom didn't exactly

18:04.333 --> 18:05.291
pick up the slack.

18:05.375 --> 18:06.667
Something wrong with her?

18:06.750 --> 18:08.333
Nice lady, just couldn't
handle
the basics you know?

18:08.417 --> 18:09.834
Wounded bird type.

18:09.917 --> 18:11.875
So when Jimmy got
into trouble with Quinn--

18:11.959 --> 18:13.375
Another wounded bird.

18:13.458 --> 18:15.500
You gave him the 200 bucks
for the abortion?

18:15.583 --> 18:18.542
Yeah. I didn't want to
see
him throw his life
away.

18:18.625 --> 18:19.959
Obviously, he disagreed.

18:20.041 --> 18:22.125
(Sutton)
'Why do you say that?'

18:22.208 --> 18:24.667
Because he returned the money.

18:24.750 --> 18:26.500
'Cause now they were
going to keep the
baby?

18:26.583 --> 18:29.291
Never mind a future in
track,
a free ride to Villanova.

18:29.375 --> 18:31.875
He figured, "Let me get
married at 18 instead."

18:31.959 --> 18:34.083
I'm guessing you tried
to talk him out of it.

18:34.166 --> 18:36.750
Yeah, it fell to me

18:36.834 --> 18:38.792
to show him the light
about the girl.

18:45.792 --> 18:47.417
Keep the money.
Don't be crazy.

18:47.500 --> 18:49.208
We're going
to have it.

18:49.291 --> 18:51.375
Jimmy, that's a big mistake.

18:51.458 --> 18:54.542
No. We'll be a family.

18:54.625 --> 18:56.417
Earlier than I
ever thought, but..

18:56.500 --> 18:59.458
What about the
track
scholarship?

18:59.542 --> 19:00.792
Maybe in
a year or two..

19:00.875 --> 19:02.834
Won't happen.
Your time is
now.

19:02.917 --> 19:04.875
I have to think of Quinn.

19:04.959 --> 19:09.500
Look...kid...I
hate to say this

19:09.583 --> 19:13.083
but, uh, are you sure
it's yours?

19:13.166 --> 19:15.709
Huh?

19:15.792 --> 19:18.667
I've seen her
with other guys..

19:18.750 --> 19:21.041
'...when you're not around.'

19:21.125 --> 19:23.166
Talking, maybe.

19:23.250 --> 19:24.875
No..

19:24.959 --> 19:26.208
...not just talking.

19:31.417 --> 19:35.041
[sighs]
I'm sorry.

19:35.125 --> 19:37.375
But maybe it's not
your mistake at all.

19:39.792 --> 19:41.625
So Quinn had
other boyfriends?

19:43.000 --> 19:45.166
I don't know if I'd
call them
boyfriends.

19:45.250 --> 19:46.500
'She made the rounds.'

19:46.583 --> 19:49.750
Was this something you knew
or just your opinion?

19:49.834 --> 19:51.750
She was oversexed, okay?

19:51.834 --> 19:53.583
But how do you know?

19:53.667 --> 19:56.834
Some girls just
put it on the
glass.

19:56.917 --> 19:58.625
And you think this
is relevant somehow

19:58.709 --> 19:59.709
to Jimmy getting killed?

19:59.792 --> 20:02.125
Yeah, I do.

20:02.208 --> 20:04.333
'Cause what if
he wised up, huh?

20:04.417 --> 20:05.917
What if he told
Quinn to beat
it?

20:06.000 --> 20:08.500
And what if,
in a female rage, with a
baby

20:08.583 --> 20:12.250
and no man, she just went
out
and mowed Jimmy down?

20:17.208 --> 20:19.375
But Jimmy was your
one and only, huh, Quinn?

20:19.458 --> 20:20.500
Like I said.

20:20.583 --> 20:21.583
That ain't what I'm hearing

20:21.667 --> 20:23.125
from his old coach.

20:23.208 --> 20:24.625
Why are you talking to him?

20:24.709 --> 20:27.500
[shouts]
Quinn, I'm busy,
and you're wasting my time!

20:27.583 --> 20:28.750
I don't know what you mean.

20:28.834 --> 20:30.834
I mean if you had
multiple boyfriends

20:30.917 --> 20:32.083
I got multiple suspects.

20:32.166 --> 20:33.417
- I didn't.
- No?

20:33.500 --> 20:35.875
The coach is making that up?

20:39.083 --> 20:40.333
Hey, Quinn.

20:40.417 --> 20:42.166
Your daughter is being
stalked by some freak

20:42.250 --> 20:43.458
who says he's her dad.

20:43.542 --> 20:44.959
Now I know you didn't
give a crap about her

20:45.041 --> 20:47.291
when you were 18, 'cause you
wanted your young, fun life

20:47.375 --> 20:48.959
and a crying baby's
a real buzz kill.

20:49.041 --> 20:51.291
- That's mean.
- But you were 18 then.

20:51.375 --> 20:54.458
How about being an
adult
now and owning up?

20:57.083 --> 20:58.417
What do you want to know?

20:58.500 --> 21:01.333
Were there other guys?

21:01.417 --> 21:03.208
One.

21:12.083 --> 21:14.667
How'd you get
out of swimming?

21:14.750 --> 21:17.000
I said I had my period.

21:17.083 --> 21:19.625
We wish.

21:19.709 --> 21:23.125
I didn't want
this either, Jimmy.

21:23.208 --> 21:25.333
I know, I know, I..

21:25.417 --> 21:27.834
I was just joking.

21:27.917 --> 21:31.500
I thought we were going
to be happy about it.

21:31.583 --> 21:32.875
We are.

21:35.291 --> 21:37.083
I'm just..

21:37.166 --> 21:39.709
...hearing things.

21:39.792 --> 21:41.000
Like what?

21:42.917 --> 21:45.166
Maybe I'm not your only guy.

21:45.250 --> 21:46.166
Who said that?

21:46.250 --> 21:49.542
Coach Johnson.

21:49.625 --> 21:51.041
Coach Johnson's a jerk.

21:51.125 --> 21:54.166
He's a teacher.
He wouldn't lie.

21:59.125 --> 22:01.333
I went to the
locker room one time..

22:04.625 --> 22:07.000
...and he was
in the office.

22:10.041 --> 22:11.417
[voice breaking]
He said he..

22:11.500 --> 22:14.333
he liked me, and..

22:14.417 --> 22:17.458
that I was pretty,
and he started touching me.

22:20.041 --> 22:22.625
I just...I just
kind of froze, Jimmy.

22:23.583 --> 22:26.041
No.

22:26.125 --> 22:28.083
No.

22:28.166 --> 22:29.834
It was over really quick.

22:29.917 --> 22:31.959
I don't believe this.

22:32.041 --> 22:33.542
I couldn't either.

22:33.625 --> 22:35.000
<i>you.</i>

22:37.041 --> 22:39.125
It's true.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.250
I..

22:42.333 --> 22:44.291
...don't think
we can be together anymore.

22:45.500 --> 22:47.041
Jimmy.

22:47.125 --> 22:49.083
If I can't trust you..

22:49.166 --> 22:51.458
But I didn't want to.

22:51.542 --> 22:53.792
It's over.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.250
God, what about the baby?

23:02.375 --> 23:03.458
I'll think of something.

23:16.291 --> 23:18.625
So, he broke it off?

23:18.709 --> 23:21.917
We weren't going to raise
the baby together anymore.

23:23.250 --> 23:25.875
What were you
going to do?

23:25.959 --> 23:28.291
Jimmy came up
with another plan.

23:28.375 --> 23:31.041
Found someone to take her.

23:31.125 --> 23:32.667
Who?

23:32.750 --> 23:35.208
I don't know.

23:35.291 --> 23:37.625
That night in the bathroom,
he just said

23:37.709 --> 23:40.458
"It's all over,"
and went to get them.

23:42.709 --> 23:44.625
You sure you didn't
go looking for
Jimmy?

23:44.709 --> 23:45.542
No.

23:45.625 --> 23:48.041
'Cause Jimmy bailing like that

23:48.125 --> 23:50.208
could be seen as motive.

23:50.291 --> 23:53.375
Jimmy dying ruined my life.

23:55.375 --> 23:57.834
Why would I do that to myself?

24:01.125 --> 24:03.417
A lot of
people
ruin their
lives.

24:08.208 --> 24:09.250
(Jeffries)
'Looked through the records'

24:09.333 --> 24:11.083
at Dr. Sterling's office.

24:11.166 --> 24:12.917
The doctor Nurse Laura
recommended?

24:13.000 --> 24:17.000
Mm-hmm. Jimmy and Quinn
went to see him March 14, '88.

24:17.083 --> 24:18.834
- That help us?
- Keep reading.

24:18.917 --> 24:21.041
An adult had to accompany
them, since they were minors.

24:21.125 --> 24:22.583
'Guess whose signature
is on the chart?'

24:22.667 --> 24:23.875
Nurse Laura's.

24:23.959 --> 24:26.458
Mm-hmm. Jered Wyatt,
their math teacher.

24:28.458 --> 24:29.458
Worth a conversation.

24:29.542 --> 24:30.709
(Lindsay)
'Lil?'

24:31.875 --> 24:32.792
Hey, Lindsey.

24:32.875 --> 24:33.875
Claire's school called.

24:33.959 --> 24:35.667
She disappeared this afternoon.

24:35.750 --> 24:36.917
(Jeffries)
'What do you mean,
disappeared?'

24:37.000 --> 24:39.417
She was abducted
outside the school.

24:42.125 --> 24:44.583
The guy in the white van.

24:56.875 --> 24:59.792
Guess who ain't answering
his phone all of a sudden?

24:59.875 --> 25:00.875
Track coach.

25:00.959 --> 25:02.917
Plus he owns
a white Dodge
van.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.625
Guy had an unnatural
interest in Quinn.

25:04.709 --> 25:06.792
Maybe now he's got
it for the kid.

25:06.875 --> 25:08.709
Hey, I'm Jo Sutton.

25:08.792 --> 25:10.583
Yeah.

25:10.667 --> 25:13.041
- Uh...Lilly Rush.
- Hi.

25:13.125 --> 25:15.583
I was getting tired of being
the only girl on the line.

25:15.667 --> 25:16.750
(Valens)
'Hey, Vera.'

25:16.834 --> 25:18.250
We know this dude.

25:22.417 --> 25:24.417
Timmy!

25:24.500 --> 25:25.583
Where's your Windex?

25:25.667 --> 25:27.834
Oh, yeah. You guys.

25:27.917 --> 25:30.041
You seen that white van
everyone's talking about?

25:30.125 --> 25:31.959
I don't, uh, get involved.

25:32.041 --> 25:35.333
- How 'bout some beer?
- What brand?

25:35.417 --> 25:37.000
You choose. Live it up.

25:37.083 --> 25:40.291
Well, yeah, I seen it. Uh,
drove
alongside this girl walking.

25:40.375 --> 25:42.250
When was that?

25:42.333 --> 25:43.250
I'd just be guessing

25:43.333 --> 25:44.333
'cause I don't really

25:44.417 --> 25:46.834
keep up with time.

25:46.917 --> 25:49.000
- Was this guy driving?
- That's the mug of the man.

25:49.083 --> 25:50.750
- Yeah.
- He force the girl in?

25:50.834 --> 25:52.667
Oh, no, chief.
She got in herself.

25:52.750 --> 25:53.959
What, like, willingly?

25:54.041 --> 25:55.458
Yeah, feet up
on the dash.

25:55.542 --> 25:58.333
Going for a nice spin.
Voluntary.

26:05.166 --> 26:08.875
Jered Wyatt?
Lieutenant
Stillman.

26:08.959 --> 26:11.166
I have to teach a night
class in an hour.

26:11.250 --> 26:12.625
We just want to get
to the bottom of your name

26:12.709 --> 26:15.583
being on this
doctor's form, Mr. Wyatt.

26:16.875 --> 26:18.458
Um..

26:18.542 --> 26:21.959
I helped out Jimmy and Quinn
'cause they were nice kids.

26:22.041 --> 26:23.625
- That all?
- That's all.

26:23.709 --> 26:25.333
(Stillman)
'Well, taking an interest
is one thing'

26:25.417 --> 26:28.125
but acting as their guardian
during a sonogram?

26:32.875 --> 26:34.709
Can I be frank?

26:34.792 --> 26:36.917
Please.

26:37.000 --> 26:40.333
- I was...married.
- And?

26:40.417 --> 26:43.417
And I wanted to
stay that way.

26:43.500 --> 26:48.083
And, well, Jimmy
had something over me.

26:59.083 --> 27:00.125
(Jimmy)
'Mr. Wyatt, I..'

27:01.375 --> 27:02.792
- Whoa.
- 'Oh, my God.'

27:02.875 --> 27:05.917
- 'Nurse Laura?'
- Hey, Jimmy.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.125
Do something, Jered.

27:07.208 --> 27:09.834
Ho-hold on a
second.
Jimmy?

27:09.917 --> 27:12.208
Jimmy! Hey, hey.
No, no, no.

27:12.291 --> 27:14.375
Take it easy now, okay?

27:14.458 --> 27:15.500
I'm not going
to say
anything.

27:15.583 --> 27:17.333
It's..

27:17.417 --> 27:18.625
Jimmy..

27:18.709 --> 27:21.834
I have a fragile
home situation.

27:21.917 --> 27:23.000
Yeah, sure..

27:23.083 --> 27:25.458
No, no, no.

27:25.542 --> 27:26.625
This is important.

27:31.166 --> 27:33.709
You do me a good turn here,
I'll do you one.

27:33.792 --> 27:34.792
What do you mean?

27:34.875 --> 27:37.041
I know about Quinn.

27:37.125 --> 27:38.959
Your problem.

27:39.041 --> 27:41.875
I want to help, if I can.

27:41.959 --> 27:44.917
We're fine.

27:45.000 --> 27:46.125
Hey.

27:46.208 --> 27:49.583
Hey, you can talk to me.

27:49.667 --> 27:52.291
We broke up, but..

27:52.375 --> 27:55.083
...we still have
the baby coming.

27:57.041 --> 27:59.500
Can I help at all?

27:59.583 --> 28:03.000
There is something we
need
for this appointment.

28:07.083 --> 28:09.542
I took them to the doctor.

28:09.625 --> 28:12.417
Now we both knew
each other's secrets.

28:12.500 --> 28:14.000
Insurance.

28:15.250 --> 28:19.041
And what did Laura
do for insurance?

28:19.125 --> 28:21.583
I don't know.

28:21.667 --> 28:26.208
But, boy, she pitched a fit
after Jimmy walked in on us.

28:26.291 --> 28:28.500
I'm talking war path.

28:34.083 --> 28:35.500
(Valens)
'Oh, you play
like you're all'

28:35.583 --> 28:37.125
'virtue and piety,
don't you, Laura?'

28:37.208 --> 28:41.166
But the truth is,
uh...not so much.

28:41.250 --> 28:43.291
If you're asking if I was..

28:43.375 --> 28:46.125
...compromised with
Jered Wyatt, yes, I was.

28:46.208 --> 28:48.500
And Jimmy was
witness to
this.

28:48.583 --> 28:50.291
That's also true.

28:50.375 --> 28:52.125
That couldn't
have sat well.

28:52.208 --> 28:53.834
You had a
reputation
to uphold.

28:53.917 --> 28:55.125
And a job to keep.

28:55.208 --> 28:58.166
Look...I know something

28:58.250 --> 29:01.542
that could probably be helpful.

29:01.625 --> 29:05.250
- Talk to Angie Parrington.
- The girl who found the baby?

29:05.333 --> 29:06.709
She was in my office every day.

29:06.792 --> 29:08.959
I had to watch her
take her medication.

29:09.041 --> 29:10.500
What kind of meds?

29:10.583 --> 29:11.917
Antipsychotics.

29:14.000 --> 29:15.250
What's that got
to do with Jimmy?

29:15.333 --> 29:16.750
She was obsessed with him.

29:16.834 --> 29:18.291
Talked about him non-stop.

29:18.375 --> 29:20.041
So...Angie's troubled.

29:20.125 --> 29:23.875
Okay, but why would
she suddenly snap?

29:23.959 --> 29:26.250
'Cause she went off
her meds for graduation.

29:32.250 --> 29:33.875
You didn't come today, Angie.

29:33.959 --> 29:35.834
- No, I didn't.
- It's been three days--

29:35.917 --> 29:38.041
I'm not taking that poison
anymore and I just
graduated.

29:38.125 --> 29:39.792
So you can't make me.

29:44.125 --> 29:45.750
- Jimmy!
- Uh, I know.

29:45.834 --> 29:47.667
- I gotta sign your book.
- No, it's not about that.

29:47.750 --> 29:49.166
It's something else, and
I know you're going to like
it.

29:49.250 --> 29:50.709
Could I find you later?

29:50.792 --> 29:52.458
No, Jimmy, I have
something for you.

29:52.542 --> 29:55.041
Quinn needs me right now.

29:55.125 --> 29:56.500
I don't know why
you
still like Quinn.

29:56.583 --> 29:58.041
- Angie..
- 'Cause she's like nothing.

29:58.125 --> 29:59.375
- She's like a background
girl.
- No she's not.

29:59.458 --> 30:00.583
She's shy, but..

30:02.125 --> 30:03.709
You don't know her.

30:03.792 --> 30:07.208
Yeah, well, I think she's fat.

30:07.291 --> 30:09.709
Jimmy. I'm going to find you.

30:11.625 --> 30:14.333
So, Angie's pretty determined
to get Jimmy alone.

30:14.417 --> 30:17.333
And she was the kind of
girl
who got what she wanted.

30:17.417 --> 30:19.041
You think she was
capable of
violence?

30:19.125 --> 30:23.083
She quit her meds once before,
her sophomore year.

30:23.166 --> 30:26.458
Lit a cheerleader's hair
on fire at a pep rally.

30:31.083 --> 30:34.375
I hear my girl Angie
was kinda nutso?

30:34.458 --> 30:35.792
I'm sorry, man.

30:35.875 --> 30:38.583
Easy come, easy go.

30:38.667 --> 30:40.709
So, has this one
pulled anything yet?

30:44.917 --> 30:47.750
Uh, no.
Not...really.

30:47.834 --> 30:50.166
Give her time.

30:50.250 --> 30:52.709
Claire sent a note
to her foster parents.

30:52.792 --> 30:53.667
Yeah?

30:53.750 --> 30:55.750
She doesn't want
to be found.

30:55.834 --> 30:58.250
"Don't worry about me.
I'm with my dad."

30:58.333 --> 31:00.417
Lieutenant, um,
I've been going
over

31:00.500 --> 31:02.250
new car purchases
from June '88.

31:02.333 --> 31:03.792
You have?

31:03.875 --> 31:05.875
New tread on the
tires, new car..

31:05.959 --> 31:08.500
That's
needle-in-a-haystack
territory.

31:08.583 --> 31:10.208
But I found something.

31:10.291 --> 31:13.083
One of the buyers
was Angie
Parrington.

31:13.166 --> 31:14.458
My Angie who found the baby?

31:14.542 --> 31:16.625
'And was pining
for Jimmy.'

31:16.709 --> 31:19.041
Bought a
Corvette
on June 10th.

31:19.125 --> 31:21.458
The day before
Jimmy was killed.

31:21.542 --> 31:25.083
Oh, Angie...
say it ain't
so.

31:30.333 --> 31:31.458
Yeah, I bought a car.

31:31.542 --> 31:32.959
It was Jimmy's
graduation present.

31:33.041 --> 31:34.458
That's quite a gift.

31:34.542 --> 31:37.375
I'm generous.

31:37.458 --> 31:41.542
So how does a high school girl
have that kind of dough?

31:41.625 --> 31:43.500
My parents missed graduation.

31:43.583 --> 31:46.709
Out of guilt, they said
I could buy any car I wanted.

31:48.709 --> 31:50.792
So what did he say?

31:50.875 --> 31:53.542
He kept blowing me off
when
I tried to tell him about
it.

31:53.625 --> 31:55.417
I finally cornered
him
in the parking lot.

31:55.500 --> 31:56.709
Show him the new set of wheels.

31:56.792 --> 31:59.875
Yeah. He saw it.
He kept walking.

31:59.959 --> 32:02.458
Sees a Corvette
and doesn't slow his pace?

32:02.542 --> 32:06.709
I know. I'm like,
"Jimmy, it's a
Corvette."

32:08.667 --> 32:10.375
But no interest.

32:10.458 --> 32:13.875
He was just rambling
about finding Mr.
Wyatt.

32:15.417 --> 32:16.333
The math teacher?

32:16.417 --> 32:18.041
Why was he looking for him?

32:18.125 --> 32:20.000
I don't know.

32:20.083 --> 32:23.959
And I'll never know
why
he was so into Quinn.

32:24.041 --> 32:27.500
But you should have seen
the way he looked at her.

32:27.583 --> 32:28.959
Now, you didn't get so upset

32:29.041 --> 32:33.333
that you turned that Corvette
on him, did you, Ange?

32:33.417 --> 32:35.333
I can't even drive stick shift.

32:40.083 --> 32:42.208
Ever have kids, Jered?

32:43.917 --> 32:45.166
No, we never did.

32:45.250 --> 32:46.458
(Sutton)
'We've done
some looking.'

32:47.375 --> 32:48.333
Seems you and your wife

32:48.417 --> 32:49.500
poured a lot of time and money

32:49.583 --> 32:51.166
into trying for a baby.

32:51.250 --> 32:52.750
Maybe for a short period.

32:52.834 --> 32:54.542
Six years.

32:54.625 --> 32:55.792
Well, we adjusted.

32:55.875 --> 32:59.709
We have...hobbies, pets.

32:59.792 --> 33:02.166
But that kind of thing
can make a marriage shaky.

33:02.250 --> 33:03.417
There was some strain.

33:03.500 --> 33:05.333
So how were you going
to turn things around?

33:05.417 --> 33:06.875
How 'bout a baby?

33:06.959 --> 33:07.917
What are you suggesting?

33:08.000 --> 33:09.125
Oh, why else would Jimmy

33:09.208 --> 33:10.166
come looking for you

33:10.250 --> 33:12.875
same night Quinn had that child?

33:12.959 --> 33:14.417
There's no proof of anything.

33:14.500 --> 33:16.709
Well, throw in that
you
were at the sonogram

33:16.792 --> 33:19.083
seems like you were
a prospective
parent.

33:25.667 --> 33:27.083
Please.

33:31.792 --> 33:32.834
Jered.

33:34.750 --> 33:36.917
It's no crime,
wanting a baby.

33:39.542 --> 33:42.750
That's all
Helen and I ever wanted.

33:42.834 --> 33:43.917
Sure.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.500
Our marriage was...dying..

33:47.709 --> 33:49.667
...everyday
we couldn't conceive.

33:49.750 --> 33:52.250
'And these two kids
pop out a baby'

33:52.333 --> 33:54.417
when they don't even want one.

33:54.500 --> 33:57.667
One weekend
and they're pregnant.

34:01.166 --> 34:03.583
They had a problem,
we had a problem.

34:06.458 --> 34:08.166
I really thought
this baby could..

34:11.208 --> 34:13.959
...could save us.

34:14.041 --> 34:16.166
So what went wrong?

34:31.709 --> 34:34.417
I got the car seat, diapers

34:34.500 --> 34:36.291
formula.

34:36.375 --> 34:38.458
'I thought of everything.'

34:38.542 --> 34:40.625
So...boy or girl?

34:40.709 --> 34:42.417
Uh, girl.

34:44.792 --> 34:46.250
So, is Quinn bringing her?

34:46.333 --> 34:47.583
Uh, no.

34:49.375 --> 34:52.166
Mr. Wyatt, I can't do it.

34:52.250 --> 34:55.333
No...we're all set.

34:55.417 --> 34:56.917
I'm sorry.

35:03.000 --> 35:03.959
What?

35:04.041 --> 35:05.250
Look, I know

35:05.333 --> 35:06.333
I'm going back on our plan

35:06.417 --> 35:07.834
and I'm sorry about it.

35:07.917 --> 35:10.000
But after seeing
what I saw..

35:10.083 --> 35:13.333
Well, I realized, those
two girls are all I want.

35:13.417 --> 35:14.959
I'm trying to save
my marriage here.

35:15.041 --> 35:16.333
I'm trying to save
something, too.

35:16.417 --> 35:17.792
This is my last hope.

35:17.875 --> 35:20.166
- Helen is waiting.
- Sorry, Mr. Wyatt.

35:20.250 --> 35:21.667
Maybe you can
adopt or something.

35:21.750 --> 35:23.917
We have already
tried that!

35:27.208 --> 35:29.792
Jimmy...listen to me now.

35:31.500 --> 35:33.458
'Jimmy!'

35:33.542 --> 35:36.709
This is my life
I'm talking about!

35:36.792 --> 35:37.917
Jimmy!

36:36.375 --> 36:37.667
Questioned Documents
got an imprint

36:37.750 --> 36:40.041
from Claire's note,
a phone number.

36:40.125 --> 36:41.208
We trace it?

36:41.291 --> 36:43.709
Viking Motel,
Spring Garden.

36:53.375 --> 36:54.834
There she is.

37:09.250 --> 37:12.250
Hi, Claire.

37:12.333 --> 37:13.625
How'd you find me?

37:13.709 --> 37:14.792
That doesn't matter.

37:14.875 --> 37:15.834
Claire,
what's going on?

37:15.917 --> 37:17.125
You want to stop there?

37:17.208 --> 37:18.792
To hell with that.

37:18.875 --> 37:20.917
No!

37:21.000 --> 37:22.291
You're under arrest.

37:22.375 --> 37:24.208
Endangering
the welfare of a
child.

37:24.291 --> 37:26.291
His family left
him.
I'm all he has.

37:26.375 --> 37:29.291
But you're not his.

37:44.917 --> 37:46.917
Look at me.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
We brought your mom.

37:49.083 --> 37:50.000
What?

37:50.083 --> 37:52.166
She was real worried about you.

38:00.208 --> 38:02.333
My God.

38:02.417 --> 38:05.625
I can see Jimmy
all over your face.

38:05.709 --> 38:07.750
Not that you care.

38:07.834 --> 38:08.917
'I do.'

38:09.000 --> 38:12.375
- I do, baby.
- Don't call me that!

38:16.083 --> 38:19.959
I messed up. Bad.

38:20.041 --> 38:22.041
I was just so sad

38:22.125 --> 38:24.333
that Jimmy didn't
want me anymore.

38:25.125 --> 38:27.458
He did want you.

38:27.542 --> 38:29.709
We know who hit
him that night.

38:31.083 --> 38:34.667
- It was Jered Wyatt.
- Yeah.

38:34.750 --> 38:37.208
(Rush)
'And you know
the reason, Claire?'

38:38.458 --> 38:41.458
You.

38:41.542 --> 38:43.875
- What do you mean?
- He wanted you for himself.

38:43.959 --> 38:45.166
But Jimmy said no.

38:45.250 --> 38:47.500
'Cause the second
he laid eyes on you

38:47.583 --> 38:50.125
there was no way
he was parting with his girls.

38:51.417 --> 38:53.417
(Quinn)
'Jimmy said that?'

38:54.542 --> 38:57.458
He was on his way back to you.

39:02.250 --> 39:04.333
"It's all over."

39:04.417 --> 39:07.583
That's what Jimmy said to you.

39:07.667 --> 39:09.792
Now I know what he meant.

39:18.959 --> 39:20.542
Oh, my God.

39:20.625 --> 39:22.208
You did it.

39:22.291 --> 39:24.417
No...you did.

39:25.667 --> 39:27.834
I've never done anything, Jimmy.

39:27.917 --> 39:30.208
You just did.

39:30.291 --> 39:32.792
You did the most amazing thing.

39:36.166 --> 39:38.458
It's a girl.

39:38.542 --> 39:41.000
Yeah?

39:41.083 --> 39:43.959
She's real small, Quinn.

39:49.542 --> 39:51.208
No, I can't.

39:51.291 --> 39:53.709
- Sure you can.
- I'll drop her.

39:53.792 --> 39:56.208
No.

39:56.291 --> 39:58.375
Look how you're holding her.

39:59.542 --> 40:01.250
A baby girl.

40:02.834 --> 40:04.875
It's all over now.

40:06.417 --> 40:08.125
I know.

40:08.208 --> 40:10.083
[crying]
I know.

40:15.125 --> 40:17.166
I have to find him.

40:21.750 --> 40:23.959
I just want to hold
her a little more.

40:26.250 --> 40:28.291
I'll be right back.

40:35.625 --> 40:37.333
Shh.

40:50.083 --> 40:52.375
[crying]
Jimmy..

40:53.917 --> 40:55.166
Jimmy!

41:04.417 --> 41:07.375
Shh.

41:21.792 --> 41:23.834
Oh, Claire..

41:29.208 --> 41:32.250
No matter what happens, baby

41:32.333 --> 41:34.583
your mom and dad loved you.
