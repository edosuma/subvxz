00:02.602 --> 00:03.103
[clanking]

00:03.602 --> 00:04.604
yup.

00:04.604 --> 00:05.605
yup.

00:06.606 --> 00:09.109
mmm-hmm.

00:09.109 --> 00:12.195
See? I told you it wasn't me
going through your garbage

00:12.195 --> 00:14.030
see? Deer.

00:14.447 --> 00:16.950
I guess we owe you an apology,

00:17.450 --> 00:20.453
and I guess those were probably
deer droppings, too.

00:20.954 --> 00:21.988
Probably.

00:21.988 --> 00:24.491
Those deer are infiltrating
the human quadrant.

00:24.491 --> 00:27.994
They've replaced fire ants
as the number one ex-urban pest.

00:28.495 --> 00:32.499
If everything I know about exterminating
is true, which it is,

00:32.499 --> 00:35.418
we got to find the queen deer
and take her out.

00:35.919 --> 00:39.422
Queen deer.
I'll bet she's beautiful.

00:39.422 --> 00:42.926
And the best part is
joseph's finally old enough to come.

00:42.926 --> 00:46.262
Yup, I'm taking my boy
on his first hunt

00:46.679 --> 00:49.182
the same way
my dad took me

00:49.182 --> 00:51.684
25 years ago.

00:52.685 --> 00:55.188
,
We're not just
killing a deer

00:55.188 --> 00:57.524
.
we're killing
joseph's childhood

00:57.941 --> 01:02.028
you. I am photographically
memorizing your face.

01:02.028 --> 01:03.530
(bill)
look at that.

01:03.530 --> 01:04.781
He's staring
right back at you.

01:04.781 --> 01:05.698

01:39.566 --> 01:43.570
ok, hank. You can borrow
my tackstar laser sight.

01:43.570 --> 01:44.904
Bobby's first hunt,

01:44.904 --> 01:47.791
so he'll need the russian
night vision goggles.

01:48.241 --> 01:50.243
My joseph's got
the bionic ear booster
,

01:50.243 --> 01:52.745
and I'll be in charge
of the good stuff.

01:52.745 --> 01:54.798
Deer wee-wee.

01:54.798 --> 01:57.634
Super-premium estrus
deer wee-wee.

01:57.634 --> 01:59.669
A little dab'll do ya.

01:59.669 --> 02:02.172
This is crazy.
People used to go hunting,

02:02.172 --> 02:05.175
and all they'd need
was an orange shirt
and a 6-pack.

02:05.175 --> 02:06.893
Times have changed, hank.

02:06.893 --> 02:09.395
But you'd know all this
if you were a hunter.

02:09.395 --> 02:10.896
For the love of god, man.

02:10.896 --> 02:12.899
You go to church
more than you go hunting.

02:12.899 --> 02:14.317
You should be ashamed.

02:14.684 --> 02:15.935
[all laughing]

02:15.935 --> 02:17.821
i'm not ashamed.

02:17.821 --> 02:20.323
And I'm glad
there's people out there
thinning the herd.

02:20.323 --> 02:22.325
But if I wanna
get sloppy drunk

02:22.325 --> 02:23.827
and shoot off guns
with a bunch of guys,

02:24.327 --> 02:25.829
i'll go to
my dad's oscar party.

02:26.246 --> 02:27.747
Hank, a hunting trip's
not just about

02:28.248 --> 02:30.250
getting drunk
or shooting deer.

02:30.250 --> 02:31.751
It's about getting out
in the woods,

02:32.252 --> 02:33.453
away from the government,

02:33.453 --> 02:35.371
where your
paper money's useless,

02:35.371 --> 02:37.123
unless you run out of leaves.

02:37.123 --> 02:40.460
Where man can
let down his guard

02:40.460 --> 02:42.212
and share his biggest fears.

02:42.512 --> 02:45.882
Dale, you with your guard down
is my biggest fear.

02:46.349 --> 02:48.852
My biggest fear is
that little pointy...

02:48.852 --> 02:50.854
Well,
i'll save it for the trip.

02:51.354 --> 02:52.105
You mean the beetle?

02:52.605 --> 02:54.607
Shut up. I was saving that
for the trip.

02:55.108 --> 02:57.110
(bobby)
don't think of it as a rifle.

02:57.110 --> 03:01.531
.
Think of it as
a part of your bod
y that fires bullets

03:01.531 --> 03:03.032
when the time comes,

03:03.533 --> 03:06.035
you think you'll be able to,
you know, pull the trigger?

03:06.536 --> 03:11.157
Oh, yeah. I don't wanna
be the only kid around
who doesn't kill a deer.

03:11.157 --> 03:14.577
You could get
a loser nickname like,
I don't know...

03:14.961 --> 03:16.246
Pork pockets?

03:16.663 --> 03:20.166
More about not
killing deer, but, yeah.

03:20.166 --> 03:21.584
But we don't
have to worry

03:22.085 --> 03:25.088
'cause we'll be hunting
with our dads. A team.

03:27.173 --> 03:28.174
[bird squawking]

03:30.677 --> 03:32.178

[groaning]

03:45.491 --> 03:46.776
[gasps]

03:46.943 --> 03:47.944
go get him, bobby.

03:47.944 --> 03:50.496
No, we're a team.

03:50.496 --> 03:51.497
[grunting]

03:51.998 --> 03:52.999
[gun clicking]

04:01.624 --> 04:03.042
[birds twittering]

04:05.011 --> 04:09.515
bobby, I just wanna say
that you are perfect,
and a man.

04:12.435 --> 04:13.937
I don't mean to brag,

04:13.937 --> 04:17.440
especially about something
that hasn't
actually happened yet.

04:18.858 --> 04:20.142
(hank)
what's with the bandages?

04:20.476 --> 04:22.478
Luanne fixing to give
you another haircut?

04:22.478 --> 04:25.982
This is for you and bobby
to take on your hunting trip.

04:25.982 --> 04:27.984
You'll be ready
for cuts, sprains,

04:27.984 --> 04:29.485
and I even put in
a needle and thread

04:29.986 --> 04:32.488
to sew your ear back on
after bobby talks it off.

04:32.822 --> 04:34.073
Yeah.

04:35.074 --> 04:37.660
We'll be gossiping
like schoolgirls.

04:38.244 --> 04:41.247
And I made a little
hunting permit case
out of a freezer bag.

04:41.748 --> 04:43.583
Give me your permit
and I'll stick it in.

04:43.583 --> 04:46.085
Well, I haven't
really got the permit yet.

04:46.502 --> 04:48.004
You didn't buy
the permit yet?

04:48.004 --> 04:49.889
Hank, what is wrong with you?

04:49.889 --> 04:51.891
Nothing.
Uh, that reminds me,

04:51.891 --> 04:54.594
did you get the batteries
for bobby's game boy?

04:54.594 --> 04:56.596
And did you pack
his backup game boy?

04:56.596 --> 04:59.098
Bobby's not
bringing toys on this trip.

04:59.098 --> 05:02.602
And when was the last time
he had 2 whole days to spend

05:02.602 --> 05:03.903
just talking with his father?

05:04.237 --> 05:06.239
I spend lots of time
with bobby.

05:06.239 --> 05:07.240
He's there when I eat.

05:07.740 --> 05:09.158
He's there when I watch t.v.

05:09.158 --> 05:11.661
I've thrown
countless balls at him
in the backyard.

05:11.661 --> 05:13.162
[sighing]

05:13.162 --> 05:14.163
hank,

05:14.163 --> 05:15.665
you're scared of
being alone with him.

05:16.115 --> 05:16.949
I am not.

05:17.417 --> 05:20.420
You are scared
of your own son.

05:20.420 --> 05:22.922
Maybe I am. So what?
I don't get him sometimes.

05:22.922 --> 05:24.874
The things that come
out of his mouth...

05:24.874 --> 05:27.377
And he's almost a teenager,
so it's just gonna get worse.

05:27.377 --> 05:30.797
And I don't know
what we're gonna
talk about for 2 days.

05:30.797 --> 05:32.432
Hell, yes, I'm scared.

05:32.432 --> 05:34.183
This is an important milestone

05:34.183 --> 05:36.969
on bobby's road to becoming
a successful adult.

05:36.969 --> 05:40.473
One of the big 3.
Age 12: first hunt.

05:40.473 --> 05:42.975
Age 16: learns to drive.

05:42.975 --> 05:45.478
Age 18: finally turns 18.

05:45.478 --> 05:47.480
Give him this milestone, hank,

05:47.480 --> 05:48.981
so he can move on
to the next and the next

05:49.482 --> 05:50.783
and eventually
move out of the house.

05:51.200 --> 05:53.820
And then you won't
have to talk to him at all.

05:53.820 --> 05:55.822
All right, fine.
I'll get the permit,

05:55.822 --> 05:59.292
bobby'll kill the deer,
and everyone will
live happily ever after.

06:02.161 --> 06:04.297
[groaning]

06:04.297 --> 06:07.467
bobby, what are you doing
in the master bedroom?

06:07.467 --> 06:09.802
The truck's all packed
, breakfast is cooked

06:09.802 --> 06:13.840
and here's your robe,
towel, and toothbrush.

06:13.840 --> 06:17.343
? I'm a traveling man
made a lot of stops ?

06:17.844 --> 06:19.345
? All over the world ?

06:19.345 --> 06:21.347
? And in every port ?

06:21.347 --> 06:25.184
? I own the heart
of at least one ??

06:25.184 --> 06:26.602
[sighing]

06:26.602 --> 06:29.105
?
hello, son.
What are you doing

06:29.105 --> 06:30.606
watching.

06:31.607 --> 06:33.609
What does a razor
smell like?

06:34.110 --> 06:36.612
I bet it smells really good.
Like metal.

06:36.612 --> 06:39.749
Yeah, huh. Ok.

06:39.749 --> 06:41.751
Why don't you wait
in the kitchen, bobby?

06:42.251 --> 06:44.253
I can't shave and talk
at the same time.

06:44.253 --> 06:46.756
That's ok.
We don't have to talk.

06:47.757 --> 06:49.375
[water splashing]

06:51.427 --> 06:53.880
hmm, your boy's
first buck.

06:53.880 --> 06:55.381
I remember my first buck.

06:55.882 --> 06:59.385
Took me 6 shots
to bring him down,
3 more to finish him off.

06:59.385 --> 07:01.387
There was no
usable meat left.

07:01.387 --> 07:03.189
But what a thrill.

07:03.189 --> 07:06.025
,
Sug', you're
taking away my boy

07:06.025 --> 07:07.977
and you're gonna
bring him home a man.

07:07.977 --> 07:09.479
]
[sniffling

07:09.479 --> 07:13.282
and how long is that
gonna take exactly?

07:13.282 --> 07:15.151
Sorry, babe.

07:15.151 --> 07:19.455
You'll have to do
without the big "d"
for at least 2 nights.

07:19.455 --> 07:21.791
??[music playing
on car stereo]

07:22.792 --> 07:23.876
dale.

07:23.876 --> 07:27.163
John redcorn.
You brought back
that tea bag I lent you?

07:27.163 --> 07:29.332
no.
I have something for joseph.

07:29.799 --> 07:32.718
Your first hunting trip
is a sacred occasion.

07:32.718 --> 07:34.554
The deer you kill
will be a relative.

07:34.887 --> 07:38.391
You must show
your respect for him
and all the deer people,

07:38.391 --> 07:40.393
first by giving thanks,

07:40.393 --> 07:42.895
then by using
every part of his body.

07:42.895 --> 07:46.315
No prob.
We're taking old mister buck
right to the rendering plant

07:46.315 --> 07:49.152
for sausageification.

07:49.152 --> 07:50.770
This hunting knife
was given to me

07:51.187 --> 07:53.689
by my father,
and to him by his father.

07:53.689 --> 07:56.576
Now, I pass it along to you.

07:56.576 --> 07:58.578
A used knife.

07:58.578 --> 08:00.079
Umm...

08:00.580 --> 08:02.114
Cool. Thanks.

08:02.114 --> 08:04.500
Let me hug my child
one last time.

08:04.500 --> 08:06.502
Oh, my big boy!

08:06.502 --> 08:08.504
About to become
my little man.

08:08.504 --> 08:11.424
[whispering]
honey, I filled your rifle bag
with fruit pies.

08:11.424 --> 08:13.426
Your rifle
is in your sleeping bag.

08:13.426 --> 08:15.127
Thanks, mom.

08:15.511 --> 08:17.263
I mean, peggy.

08:17.763 --> 08:19.515
(dale)
let's go! Let's go!
Let's go!

08:19.515 --> 08:20.600
Just a second.

08:20.600 --> 08:22.101
There's one last errand
I need to run.

08:22.518 --> 08:24.020
What do you need?
Mike and ike's?

08:24.020 --> 08:25.438
Got you covered.

08:25.438 --> 08:27.857
no,
I just need to hop on over
to the county office

08:27.857 --> 08:30.226
and pick up a couple
of hunting permits.

08:30.226 --> 08:32.361
Don't worry,
i'll be right back.

08:35.565 --> 08:36.399
?
Can I help you

08:36.866 --> 08:38.366
yeah,
i'm taking my boy hunting,

08:38.366 --> 08:40.369
so I need
a couple of permits.

08:40.369 --> 08:44.323
Oh, and one of those
"don't mess with texas"
bumper stickers.

08:44.323 --> 08:45.825
No more deer permits
this year.

08:45.825 --> 08:47.827
Why not?
They haven't all been shot.

08:48.327 --> 08:51.631
I caught one
picking through my garbage
like this was new york city.

08:51.631 --> 08:53.716
I know.
They're a real nuisance.

08:53.716 --> 08:54.717
They're eating
everything in sight.

08:55.218 --> 08:58.221
Of course.
There's too many deer
and not enough food.

08:58.221 --> 09:00.223
Issue more permits
or they'll all starve.

09:00.223 --> 09:01.090
Yeah, sorry.

09:01.090 --> 09:03.059
We had to limit it
to 400 this year.

09:03.059 --> 09:06.312
Only way to get
the environmentalists
off their hunger strike.

09:06.312 --> 09:08.814
So you're telling me
my boy can't go hunting

09:08.814 --> 09:12.068
because you wouldn't let
a couple of twig boys starve?

09:12.068 --> 09:13.402
Forget number 6.

09:13.653 --> 09:15.905
You're now serving nonsense.

09:19.992 --> 09:21.494
Good luck on your
hunting trip, bobby.

09:21.994 --> 09:22.745
Thanks.

09:23.029 --> 09:25.531
Just so you know,
i'm leaving a boy,

09:26.032 --> 09:28.034
i'm coming back a man.

09:28.451 --> 09:31.454
You're lucky.
I'm leaving a girl,
and coming back a man.

09:31.954 --> 09:33.956
(kahn)
hey, kahn jr.!
I'm in the car.

09:33.956 --> 09:34.957
You ride shotgun.

09:35.458 --> 09:37.460
And don't forget
raisin bagels.

09:37.460 --> 09:39.712
They're in my briefcase.

09:39.712 --> 09:41.514
All right, everyone,
let's go.

09:41.797 --> 09:43.799
Uh, guys,
why don't you go on ahead?

09:43.799 --> 09:45.134
Bobby, hop in.

09:48.020 --> 09:49.772
[tires screeching]

09:49.772 --> 09:50.940
[exhaling]

09:51.307 --> 09:53.943
bobby, uh, there's something
I want to tell you.

09:54.443 --> 09:56.529
(bobby)
no, me first.

09:56.529 --> 09:59.532
I know I'm about
to be a man, dad.

09:59.532 --> 10:02.535
So I wanted to take
this last chance

10:02.535 --> 10:04.870
to tell you
how much I love you.

10:05.788 --> 10:06.789
[sighing]

10:06.789 --> 10:10.293
you might want to take
this last chance to cry, too.

10:10.293 --> 10:12.161
Because we're not going.

10:20.753 --> 10:22.722
[grunting]

10:22.722 --> 10:23.889
you see that?

10:23.889 --> 10:26.392
He's already practicing up
for next season.

10:26.392 --> 10:29.228
I tell you what, peggy
, with this extra year
under his belt,

10:29.228 --> 10:34.433
he's not only gonna be a man,
he's gonna be a superman.

10:34.433 --> 10:35.434
How do you like that?

10:35.434 --> 10:37.937
Our son, a superman.

10:38.437 --> 10:39.438
[sighing]

10:39.939 --> 10:41.607
you have no clue, do you?

10:41.607 --> 10:43.109
Would you look at him?

10:43.109 --> 10:45.861
He's at the age
where little-boy hormones
get violent.

10:45.861 --> 10:48.864
They don't call
them nice, quiet,
well-behaved hormones.

10:48.864 --> 10:50.282
They're raging, hank!

10:50.282 --> 10:53.285
He has
a chemical need to kill.

10:53.285 --> 10:56.956
I was counting on you
to channel that need
away from humans.

10:57.289 --> 10:58.874
[cocking]

11:03.462 --> 11:04.847
[yelling]

11:07.383 --> 11:09.218
[panting]

11:09.719 --> 11:11.721
i'll be locking
my bedroom door tonight.

11:11.721 --> 11:14.140
So please be in
by 10:00 p.m.

11:14.640 --> 11:16.642
Red dog one,
this is red dog three.

11:17.143 --> 11:18.227
Do you copy? Over.

11:18.227 --> 11:20.229
Ten-four, red dog three.

11:20.730 --> 11:21.731
[walkie-talkie screeching]

11:21.731 --> 11:23.065
[both screaming]

11:23.065 --> 11:26.035
damn inferior soviet
surplus merchandise.

11:26.035 --> 11:27.787
Never does what
it's supposed to.

11:28.204 --> 11:32.208
Or maybe it's doing
exactly what
it's supposed to do.

11:32.208 --> 11:34.210
Maybe it just
bounced a signal

11:34.710 --> 11:36.212
off a satellite
to an attack sub

11:36.212 --> 11:40.499
in the gulf of mexico
whose mission is
to read our brain waves.

11:40.499 --> 11:42.418
That's my boy!

11:42.418 --> 11:46.422
I was about to say
precisely the same thing.

11:46.422 --> 11:48.758
Except the sub's
in lake superior.

11:49.975 --> 11:51.894
(peggy)
what are you doing, bobby?

11:51.894 --> 11:53.396
Nothing.

11:54.897 --> 11:56.399
There's a spider
in the kitchen.

11:56.399 --> 11:57.900
Would you like
to come kill it?

11:57.900 --> 11:59.402
No, thanks.

12:00.403 --> 12:01.821
Ok, then.

12:02.321 --> 12:03.823
[peggy swatting]

12:04.323 --> 12:05.324
[sighing]

12:06.158 --> 12:07.576
[snoring]

12:07.576 --> 12:09.578
hank! Hank, wake up.

12:09.578 --> 12:11.580
I just want to tell you that
i'm learning more about

12:11.580 --> 12:13.332
how you destroyed
bobby's life.

12:13.332 --> 12:18.170
I searched through
my old social studies files,
and look what I found.

12:18.170 --> 12:20.673
In a tribe in
papua new guinea,

12:20.673 --> 12:23.175
a boy who misses out o
n a rite of passage,

12:23.175 --> 12:27.680
in their case,
killing a missionary,
remains a boy forever.

12:27.680 --> 12:30.599
He will never
become a man.

12:30.599 --> 12:34.937
This is a report
by a 7th-grader.
And it only got a "c."

12:35.354 --> 12:38.390
I have backup.
Look at this
4th-grade word find

12:38.390 --> 12:41.193
about the huron
indians' rites of passage.

12:41.193 --> 12:42.645
"madness"?

12:43.145 --> 12:46.148
When a little
huron indian boy
wants to achieve manhood

12:46.148 --> 12:49.151
but he fails to kill an elk,
he will get physically ill

12:49.151 --> 12:52.071
and then go
stark raving mad.

12:52.071 --> 12:56.075
Well, I did see
bobby talking to
the Mrs. Butterworth bottle.

12:56.575 --> 12:59.328
But I didn't
think it was strange
at the time.

12:59.829 --> 13:00.830
(eustace)
hey, hank,

13:01.330 --> 13:03.833
could you give me a hand
carrying this out to my s.u.v?

13:03.833 --> 13:07.586
Eustace? I've never seen you
in here before.

13:07.586 --> 13:10.473
Finally decided
to make the switch
to propane, huh?

13:10.473 --> 13:14.426
You know, I think you'll find
it's the perfect choice
for all your heating--

13:14.426 --> 13:16.095
Thanks, but we use
passive solar.

13:16.595 --> 13:19.932
The propane's for
cooking randy's deer,
once he kills it, of course.

13:20.399 --> 13:24.186
What? You're gonna take
that son of yours hunting?

13:24.186 --> 13:26.021
Oh, I've got to.
It's a rite of passage.

13:26.522 --> 13:28.524
At least, that's the feeling
in my men's group.

13:28.524 --> 13:30.526
.
That's why I'm not
taking any chances

13:30.526 --> 13:32.027
la grunta.

13:32.027 --> 13:35.030
The la grunta hotel and resort
does a hunt every year.

13:35.030 --> 13:36.415
They take care
of everything.

13:36.415 --> 13:39.869
Guns, permits,
apres hunt wine-tasting.

13:39.869 --> 13:41.370
Permits?

13:41.871 --> 13:45.624
"cushioned shooting stands,
heated blinds
with automatic corn feeders."

13:45.624 --> 13:46.625
That's not hunting.

13:46.625 --> 13:48.627
That's shooting fish
in a barrel.

13:48.627 --> 13:50.629
.
(eustace)
oh, they--they
have that, too

14:00.222 --> 14:01.607
[exclaims]

14:02.107 --> 14:04.393
you want to ride
bikes with me?

14:04.894 --> 14:06.645
ok.

14:06.979 --> 14:09.982
...which brings us
to the trilateral commission.

14:09.982 --> 14:12.484
Ironically named,
because there's actually 4--

14:12.484 --> 14:15.321
Dad, I think
I hear a deer.

14:15.321 --> 14:15.955
[gulps]

14:16.455 --> 14:18.541
i'd better
go have a look.

14:26.465 --> 14:28.884
[screaming]

14:28.884 --> 14:30.085
thanks.

14:30.085 --> 14:30.886
[gun firing]

14:31.387 --> 14:32.388
[whooping]

14:32.388 --> 14:34.390
[both laughing victoriously]

14:35.391 --> 14:36.892
nice throw, dad.

14:36.892 --> 14:38.394
Nice shot, son.

14:38.394 --> 14:40.396
We make a great team,
don't we?

14:40.396 --> 14:41.397
yup.

14:41.397 --> 14:44.316
The gribble doesn't
fall far from the tree.

14:44.316 --> 14:45.317
[both chuckle]

14:47.019 --> 14:49.021
[imitating gunfire]

14:49.021 --> 14:50.823
[imitating gunfire]

14:51.240 --> 14:52.775
[gasps]

14:52.775 --> 14:53.742
[whimpering]

14:53.742 --> 14:54.994
bobby!

14:54.994 --> 14:56.495
Bobby, stop playing dead.

14:56.495 --> 14:58.280
Get up before
someone sees you.

14:58.581 --> 15:02.368
What was that?
Dad, is that you?

15:02.368 --> 15:04.370
Everything's so dim.

15:04.870 --> 15:05.955
Bobby, get up.

15:05.955 --> 15:07.339
I'm not gonna make it.

15:07.790 --> 15:08.791
You are not injured.

15:09.291 --> 15:11.293
The gold is buried...

15:11.293 --> 15:12.795
[wheezing]

15:13.796 --> 15:15.297
it's buried...

15:17.216 --> 15:18.384
[moaning]

15:18.384 --> 15:19.802
stand up.

15:19.802 --> 15:22.054
Bobby, look what I got.

15:22.054 --> 15:23.722
[exclaiming victoriously]

15:23.722 --> 15:25.224
I got shot in a holdup.

15:25.224 --> 15:26.558
What?

15:26.558 --> 15:28.060
He's fine, connie.

15:28.060 --> 15:31.897
.
He had an allergic reactio
n to a fruit pie, that's all

15:31.897 --> 15:33.399
(bill)
that's it.

15:33.699 --> 15:36.652
Hell, yeah.
Look at that beaut.

15:36.652 --> 15:38.654
How about this kid, hank?

15:38.654 --> 15:41.540
Excuse me.
How about this man?

15:41.540 --> 15:43.375
Look at me.

15:43.375 --> 15:46.211
Everybody's got
a deer and I don't.

15:47.212 --> 15:48.213
[sniffling]

15:48.213 --> 15:51.717
everything looks
so christmassy.

15:54.219 --> 15:58.223
Now I know how
the jewish kids feel.

15:58.223 --> 15:59.642
[bobby crying]

15:59.642 --> 16:03.145
bobby, how would you
like to trade in
that cowboy costume

16:03.646 --> 16:05.314
for a hunting permit?

16:05.814 --> 16:09.401
What? Do you mean it?
You got a permit?

16:09.401 --> 16:11.103
I got better than a permit.

16:11.487 --> 16:13.489
I got la grunta.

16:20.446 --> 16:23.032
This is fancy.
Where do the deer stay?

16:23.532 --> 16:25.534
They don't keep
the deer in the hotel.

16:26.452 --> 16:28.454
God! I hope they don't.

16:29.121 --> 16:32.124
Hi, I'm beverly la grunta.
No relation.

16:32.124 --> 16:33.125
?
Can I help you

16:33.125 --> 16:35.544
uh, we're here
to deer hunt.

16:35.544 --> 16:38.047
Wonderful! The shuttle leaves
in a half an hour.

16:38.047 --> 16:39.548
It's $400 for two.

16:39.548 --> 16:41.133
Will that be cash or credit?

16:41.133 --> 16:42.634
$400?

16:43.052 --> 16:46.939
Uh, hey, bobby,
look at all this other stuff.

16:46.939 --> 16:49.942
We could golf or
swim with a dolphin.

16:49.942 --> 16:51.610
Can I hunt it?

16:51.610 --> 16:56.115
Uh, it doesn't say.
Hey, here you go.
"museum of miniatures."

16:56.115 --> 16:58.951
$40 and worth every penny,
if you ask me.

17:01.954 --> 17:02.955
Don't get upset, now.

17:03.455 --> 17:05.457
I was just testing you.

17:05.457 --> 17:06.458
[laughs nervously]

17:06.458 --> 17:07.960
you passed.

17:11.163 --> 17:12.414
(boy)
hey, bobby!

17:13.715 --> 17:14.967
Look at my deer.

17:15.250 --> 17:18.053
.
He shot it
all by himself

at the gift shop.

it's beautiful

17:36.155 --> 17:37.656
boy, you said it.

17:37.656 --> 17:39.158
Now, careful when you walk.

17:39.158 --> 17:43.162
Deer can hear
the rhythmic pattern
of human footsteps.

Gotcha!

17:46.665 --> 17:48.784
[vehicle approaching]

17:48.784 --> 17:52.538
there's an open stand
in pasture 2
with your name on it.

17:53.005 --> 17:54.339
That'd be hill, right?

17:54.757 --> 17:57.259
I will never
forget this moment, dad.

17:57.259 --> 18:01.263
It's the greatest thing
that ever happened to me.

18:01.263 --> 18:04.266
When I'm a man,
do I still get my allowance

18:04.266 --> 18:07.302
or do I get up
to minimum wage?

18:07.302 --> 18:09.304
Well, son, now that
you're gonna be a man,

18:09.805 --> 18:12.307
you're gonna have
more responsibilities,

18:12.307 --> 18:15.310
and maybe you do deserve
a little more each week.

18:15.811 --> 18:16.812
yup.

18:17.813 --> 18:18.814
yup!

I think I'm gonna shoot
the one on the left.

?
What do you think, dad

18:34.379 --> 18:37.382
uh, I don't think
you have to
whisper anymore, bobby.

18:41.670 --> 18:44.807
(bobby)
squeeze, don't pull.

18:49.011 --> 18:50.512
[birds twittering]

18:52.014 --> 18:54.016

is it, dad?

No, it isn't, son.

19:00.606 --> 19:01.607

i'm sorry, bobby.

19:02.024 --> 19:04.026
I guess I really let
you down, didn't i?

19:04.026 --> 19:08.447
It's ok.
I know you didn't mean for it
to be this horrible.

19:08.447 --> 19:10.449
You know, there's plenty
of worse things

19:10.449 --> 19:12.451
than getting to hold o
n to your boyhood

19:12.451 --> 19:13.785

for a whole other year

19:14.286 --> 19:17.756

to your boyhood,
I don't mean--

19:18.123 --> 19:20.125
I know, dad. I know.

19:20.626 --> 19:24.046
Look at it this way.
This gives me an extra year

to learn from the man
i'd most like to be like

19:27.216 --> 19:29.718

This just ain't right.

You're 12 years old.
You're a good son.

19:37.109 --> 19:38.977
You deserve
better than this.

i'm gonna skip you ahead
one whole milestone.

I'm gonna let you
drive my truck.

19:45.117 --> 19:46.118
What?

19:46.618 --> 19:48.120
You heard me.
Well, come on.

19:48.120 --> 19:50.122

It's real,
and it's really happening.

reach the pedals.

20:02.801 --> 20:05.137
and now,
we'll fix your mirror.

20:05.137 --> 20:07.589
Ok, start her up.

20:07.589 --> 20:10.893
Now, that's the gear shift,
and that's the brake.

20:10.893 --> 20:12.394
And, well,
you've seen the movies.

20:12.394 --> 20:14.313

the hell out of this truck
, aren't i, dad?

Oh, god!

Yeah. Yeah, you did.

Yup, a good kill.

You should have
seen it, peggy.
