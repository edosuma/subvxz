00:02.502 --> 00:04.086
-<i> HOT IN CLEVELAND</i>
IS RECORDED

00:04.170 --> 00:06.131
IN FRONT
OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:06.214 --> 00:07.924
IT'S HERE, EVERYONE--

00:08.007 --> 00:11.720
MY INTERVIEW
IN <i> COSMOPOLITAN</i> MAGAZINE.

00:11.803 --> 00:14.889
- "VICTORIA CHASE SIZZLES
IN HER FABULOUS 40s."

00:14.973 --> 00:18.184
- WHY ARE YOU BRINGING US
20-YEAR-OLD <i> COSMOS?</i>

00:19.686 --> 00:21.104
- GOD, THIS MAGAZINE!

00:21.187 --> 00:22.605
IN THE LAST 30 YEARS,

00:22.689 --> 00:24.607
I MUST HAVE READ
7,000 SEX TIPS.

00:24.691 --> 00:26.401
AND IT ALL COMES DOWN TO TWO--

00:26.484 --> 00:29.279
BE A WOMAN AND SHOW UP.

00:29.362 --> 00:30.280
- MY MOTHER TOLD ME,

00:30.363 --> 00:34.075
"WIGGLE YOUR HIPS
AND SAY HIS NAME A LOT."

00:34.159 --> 00:37.787
IN POLISH, IT RHYMES.

00:37.871 --> 00:40.331
- OH, THIS IS ALL
SO EXCITING.

00:40.415 --> 00:43.460
BEING IN A WOODY ALLEN MOVIE
AND DATING SIR EMMET LAWSON

00:43.543 --> 00:46.463
HAS MADE ME
PRESS-WORTHY AGAIN.

00:46.546 --> 00:48.590
[gasps]
OH, MY GOD.

00:48.673 --> 00:50.133
IT'S JIMMY KIMMEL'S OFFICE.

00:50.216 --> 00:53.094
- ANSWER IT.
- I CAN'T PICK UP MY OWN PHONE.

00:53.178 --> 00:55.805
I NEED AN ASSISTANT.
MELANIE, YOU'RE HIRED.

00:55.889 --> 00:57.474
- VICTORIA, I HAVE A JOB.

00:57.557 --> 00:59.934
- DOING...?

01:00.018 --> 01:00.810
- I'VE BEEN WORKING

01:00.894 --> 01:03.188
AT A PUBLIC RELATIONS FIRM
FOR MONTHS.

01:03.271 --> 01:05.482
- HUH.
JOY, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

01:05.565 --> 01:06.983
- I'M IN COLLEGE.

01:07.066 --> 01:10.487
- WHEN DID ALL OF THIS HAPPEN?

01:10.570 --> 01:11.863
- COME ON, JOY,
WE GOT TO GET GOING.

01:11.946 --> 01:12.989
WE'RE PLAYING TENNIS
BEFORE WORK

01:13.072 --> 01:14.657
WITH ALEC
AND HIS FRIEND BILL.

01:14.741 --> 01:16.576
- THIS ISN'T
A SECRET FIX-UP, IS IT?

01:16.659 --> 01:17.994
- NO, NO, WE JUST NEED
A FOURTH.

01:18.077 --> 01:19.287
- GOOD, 'CAUSE I'M TAKING
A BREAK FROM DATING.

01:19.370 --> 01:20.997
I REALLY NEED
A LITTLE PERSPECTIVE.

01:21.080 --> 01:22.999
- HE'S 6'2"
AND SUPER CUTE.

01:23.082 --> 01:24.918
- AND THAT'S
JUST THE PERSPECTIVE I NEEDED.

01:25.001 --> 01:26.503
HURRY UP. WE'LL BE LATE
FOR OUR DATE.

01:26.586 --> 01:27.879
- OKAY,
BUT I REALLY SHOULD WARN YOU,

01:27.962 --> 01:29.005
HE'S A WORD SHORTENER.

01:29.088 --> 01:30.799
VACATION IS "VACAY,"

01:30.882 --> 01:32.717
SESSION IS "SESH,"
CLEVELAND IS "CLEVE."

01:32.801 --> 01:33.843
- MM, THAT SOUNDS ANNOYING.

01:33.927 --> 01:35.220
- HE ALSO OWNS
HIS OWN RESTAURANT.

01:35.303 --> 01:37.430
- "TERRIF."

01:37.514 --> 01:39.933
- TALK TO ME, BABE.

01:40.016 --> 01:41.935
- ELKA, WHO ARE YOU CALLING?

01:42.018 --> 01:43.728
- KIMMEL.

01:43.812 --> 01:46.022
- WHAT?
- I'M YOUR NEW ASSISTANT.

01:46.105 --> 01:48.024
- HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND?

01:48.107 --> 01:48.942
- I GOT THIS.

01:49.025 --> 01:51.486
I WATCHED EVERY EPISODE
OF <i> ENTOURAGE.</i>

01:51.569 --> 01:52.695
- ALL RIGHT,
GIVE ME THAT PHONE.

01:52.779 --> 01:55.031
- VICTORIA CHASE RETURNING.

01:55.114 --> 01:57.325
IF SHE DOESN'T GET
THE FIRST SPOT,

01:57.408 --> 01:59.577
SHE'S GOING STRAIGHT
TO LETTERMAN.

01:59.661 --> 02:02.163
- NO, NO,
ANY SPOT IS FINE.

02:02.247 --> 02:03.414
- FIRST SPOT?

02:03.498 --> 02:05.750
OH, THANK YOU, BERNIE.

02:05.834 --> 02:08.336
SEE YOU FRIDAY AT TEMPLE.

02:08.419 --> 02:10.797
- TEMPLE, REALLY?

02:10.880 --> 02:13.424
- HE'S NOT GONNA BE THERE
EITHER.

02:23.643 --> 02:25.186
{\an8}- WHAT A GREAT GAME!

02:25.270 --> 02:26.855
{\an8}BOY, YOU REALLY HUSTLE
ON THE COURT.

02:26.938 --> 02:29.023
{\an8}- I LIKE TO WIN.
- I JUST LIKE TO PLAY.

02:29.107 --> 02:30.275
{\an8}I DON'T CARE WHO WINS.

02:30.358 --> 02:32.944
{\an8}- I NOTICED.

02:33.027 --> 02:35.738
{\an8}- BUT, WOW, YOU AND BILL,
YOU GUYS SURE ARE COMPETITIVE.

02:35.822 --> 02:37.699
{\an8}- OH, THAT'S JUST
ALL IN GOOD FUN.

02:37.782 --> 02:39.534
{\an8}AND THE FUN PART IS,
I AM BETTER THAN HIM

02:39.617 --> 02:41.536
{\an8}BY, LIKE, A LOT.

02:41.619 --> 02:43.204
{\an8}- HEY, BILL AND JOY
REALLY SEEMED TO HIT IT OFF.

02:43.288 --> 02:44.581
{\an8}DO YOU THINK
MAYBE WE SHOULD INVITE 'EM

02:44.664 --> 02:45.415
{\an8}FOR GAME NIGHT SATURDAY?

02:45.498 --> 02:46.875
{\an8}- I DON'T KNOW.

02:46.958 --> 02:48.877
{\an8}FRIENDS DATING FRIENDS--
THAT GETS WEIRD.

02:48.960 --> 02:50.211
{\an8}- WELL, NO,
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE.

02:50.295 --> 02:52.922
{\an8}AND JOY REALLY DESERVES
A GREAT GUY LIKE BILL.

02:53.006 --> 02:54.883
{\an8}SHE'S HAD BAD LUCK WITH MEN.

02:54.966 --> 02:56.301
{\an8}BUT DON'T TELL BILL,
I DON'T WANT TO SPOOK HIM.

02:56.384 --> 02:58.219
{\an8}[phone chimes]

02:58.303 --> 02:59.888
{\an8}- OH, SWEET!

02:59.971 --> 03:01.222
{\an8}I JUST GOT SELECTED

03:01.306 --> 03:02.932
{\an8}TO BE CLEVELAND'S
MOST ELIGIBLE BACHELOR

03:03.016 --> 03:07.228
{\an8}FOR THE SIXTH YEAR IN A ROW.

03:07.312 --> 03:09.939
{\an8}- OH, THAT'S TERRIFIC.

03:10.023 --> 03:11.316
{\an8}- YOU DON'T SEEM HAPPY
ABOUT IT.

03:11.399 --> 03:12.901
{\an8}- NO, I AM, I AM.

03:12.984 --> 03:14.235
{\an8}YEAH, I JUST DIDN'T THINK
YOU WERE GONNA BE

03:14.319 --> 03:15.445
{\an8}IN THE RUNNING THIS YEAR,

03:15.528 --> 03:17.780
{\an8}'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,
THE WORD "ELIGIBLE"

03:17.864 --> 03:20.575
{\an8}MAKES YOU SOUND SO ELIGIBLE.

03:20.658 --> 03:22.118
{\an8}- WHICH, OF COURSE,
I'M NOT...

03:22.201 --> 03:25.079
{\an8}ALTHOUGH CHLOE ALWAYS THOUGHT
IT WAS GOOD FOR BUSINESS.

03:25.163 --> 03:27.957
{\an8}- UH-HUH.
UH-HUH.

03:28.041 --> 03:31.502
{\an8}BUT CHLOE DOESN'T WORK
HERE ANYMORE.

03:31.586 --> 03:35.173
{\an8}SO IT ONLY MATTERS
WHAT YOU THINK.

03:35.256 --> 03:36.674
{\an8}SO...

03:36.758 --> 03:39.636
{\an8}WHAT DO YOU THINK?

03:39.719 --> 03:42.305
- I GUESS I THINK
THAT I DON'T NEED TO BE

03:42.388 --> 03:44.599
ON SOME SILLY MAGAZINE COVER.
- [chuckles]

03:44.682 --> 03:46.351
YOU'D GIVE UP YOUR CROWN
AND ALL THE PERKS FOR ME?

03:46.434 --> 03:47.852
- ABSOLUTELY.

03:47.936 --> 03:50.104
AND THERE'S NO CROWN, BUT...

03:50.188 --> 03:53.691
WELL, THERE ARE SOME PERKS--
FREE EYE EXAM...

03:53.775 --> 03:55.109
10% OFF DUNKIN' DONUTS.

03:55.193 --> 03:58.905
BOY, I USE THAT EVERY DAY.

03:58.988 --> 04:00.865
- JOY, YOU HAVE
A WICKED BACKHAND.

04:00.949 --> 04:03.618
TOTALLY "RIDIC."

04:03.701 --> 04:05.328
- THANKS.

04:05.411 --> 04:08.581
I GUESS WE BOTH LIVE
FOR THE "COMPETISH."

04:10.750 --> 04:12.168
- WHOA.

04:12.251 --> 04:15.171
I JUST GOT NAMED
CLEVE'S MOST ELIGIBLE BACHELOR.

04:15.254 --> 04:17.632
- [gasps]
CONGRATULATIONS.

04:17.714 --> 04:20.218
HEY, DIDN'T ALEC WIN THAT,
LIKE, FIVE YEARS IN A ROW?

04:20.301 --> 04:22.470
- THE TORCH HAS BEEN PASSED.

04:22.553 --> 04:24.806
AND I CANNOT WAIT
TO FIND JUST THE RIGHT MOMENT

04:24.889 --> 04:28.017
TO RUB THAT TORCH
IN HIS FACE.

04:28.101 --> 04:29.227
- SO, STU,

04:29.310 --> 04:31.354
SINCE YOU CAN'T SATISFY
YOUR WIFE,

04:31.437 --> 04:34.190
HOW ABOUT YOU SATISFY ME?

04:36.609 --> 04:38.861
YES, I'LL HOLD.
- ELKA?

04:38.945 --> 04:40.446
WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO NOW?

04:40.530 --> 04:44.117
- TARANTINO'S PEOPLE.

04:44.200 --> 04:46.119
I'M PITCHING YOU
FOR HIS NEXT MOVIE.

04:46.202 --> 04:48.663
- WHAT?
NO, NO, YOU'RE NOT MY AGENT.

04:48.746 --> 04:49.872
YOU'RE MY ASSISTANT.

04:49.956 --> 04:53.167
- I PROMOTED MYSELF.

04:53.251 --> 04:56.713
- ELKA, VICTORIA,
THIS IS ALEC'S FRIEND BILL.

04:56.796 --> 04:58.381
- OH, HI, BILL.
- OH.

04:58.464 --> 04:59.549
- BILL JUST GOT VOTED

04:59.632 --> 05:01.259
CLEVELAND'S
MOST ELIGIBLE BACHELOR.

05:01.342 --> 05:03.428
- OH, CONGRATULATIONS.

05:03.511 --> 05:05.221
AND IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN,

05:05.304 --> 05:07.890
YOUR RESTAURANT JUST EARNED
A COVETED MICHELIN STAR.

05:07.974 --> 05:12.395
- YOU ARE NOT MISTAKEN.
WE DID SCORE A "MISH."

05:12.478 --> 05:16.065
- DON'T TELL BILL,
BUT HIS RESTAURANT IS OVERRATED.

05:16.149 --> 05:18.234
ALL HE DOES IS SLAP TRUFFLES
ON EVERYTHING.

05:20.987 --> 05:24.782
- SO, STU,
STOP YANKING MY CHAIN.

05:24.866 --> 05:26.451
PUT MARTY ON.

05:26.534 --> 05:27.785
- WHO'S MARTY?

05:27.869 --> 05:30.913
- THERE'S ALWAYS A MARTY.

05:34.459 --> 05:36.961
- [sighs]

05:37.045 --> 05:39.422
- ARE YOU SURE
YOU'RE NOT DISAPPOINTED?

05:39.505 --> 05:41.215
- WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?

05:41.299 --> 05:43.217
- BECAUSE YOU KEEP LOOKING AT
LAST YEAR'S ISSUE AND SIGHING.

05:43.301 --> 05:44.927
- OH, NO.

05:45.011 --> 05:47.263
I HAD A GOOD RUN.

05:47.346 --> 05:51.809
NOPE, NOW I'M FREE
TO GROW OUT MY SOUL PATCH.

05:51.893 --> 05:53.102
- SOUL PATCH?

05:53.186 --> 05:57.231
IS THAT THAT LITTLE BEARD
THAT GNOMES HAVE?

05:57.315 --> 05:58.399
- YEAH, YEAH.

05:58.483 --> 06:00.026
ALL THE GUYS
IN MY BASKETBALL LEAGUE,

06:00.109 --> 06:01.611
THEY ALL PATCH OUT
FOR THE SEASON.

06:01.694 --> 06:03.112
SEE?
I STARTED ALREADY.

06:03.196 --> 06:06.282
- OH, YEAH. I JUST THOUGHT
YOU MISSED A SPOT SHAVING.

06:06.365 --> 06:07.784
- YOU'RE NOT A FAN
OF THE SOUL PATCH?

06:07.867 --> 06:09.452
- NO, NO, I LOVE 'EM.

06:09.535 --> 06:14.248
IT'S LIKE YOU'RE
MY VERY OWN STARBUCKS BARISTA.

06:14.332 --> 06:16.584
- YOU KNOW, THE COFFEE
AT DUNKIN' DONUTS IS BETTER.

06:16.667 --> 06:18.920
WAS BETTER.

06:19.003 --> 06:20.338
- [giggles]
YOU'RE FUNNY.

06:20.421 --> 06:22.298
[door opens]

06:22.381 --> 06:24.634
- SO, UH, OIL OF OLAY WOULD BE
A HUGE BOOST

06:24.717 --> 06:26.969
TO OUR NATIONAL...

06:27.053 --> 06:28.471
[door closes]
OKAY, SHE'S GONE.

06:28.554 --> 06:30.807
WHERE WERE WE?
- WAIT.

06:30.890 --> 06:32.975
WHY CAN'T WE TELL PEOPLE IN THE
OFFICE THAT WE'RE DATING NOW

06:33.059 --> 06:35.186
SO WE CAN AVOID
AWKWARD MOMENTS LIKE THAT?

06:35.269 --> 06:37.814
- WELL, IT ACTUALLY MIGHT CREATE
MORE AWKWARD MOMENTS,

06:37.897 --> 06:39.816
LIKE PEOPLE THINKING
YOU'RE GETTING SPECIAL TREATMENT

06:39.899 --> 06:42.485
FOR SLEEPING WITH THE BOSS.

06:42.568 --> 06:45.196
- YOU SOUND LIKE YOU HAVE
SOME EXPERIENCE WITH THIS.

06:45.279 --> 06:48.199
- WELL...
TO BE HONEST,

06:48.282 --> 06:50.284
I, UH--I HAVE DATED
WITHIN THE OFFICE,

06:50.368 --> 06:51.953
AND IT GETS COMPLICATED.

06:52.036 --> 06:55.331
- OH.

06:55.414 --> 06:57.500
NOT THAT IT MATTERS,
'CAUSE IT SO DOESN'T...

06:57.583 --> 07:00.503
[chuckles awkwardly]
BUT WHO WAS IT?

07:00.586 --> 07:02.296
- LOOK, THERE'S NO POINT
IN TELLING YOU.

07:02.380 --> 07:03.673
IT'S IN THE PAST.

07:03.756 --> 07:05.675
LET'S JUST LET IT GO.
- OKAY, YOU'RE RIGHT.

07:05.758 --> 07:07.510
IT'S IN THE PAST.
I'LL LET IT GO.

07:07.593 --> 07:10.138
WAS IT LISA,
THE COPYWRITER?

07:10.221 --> 07:11.180
- MELANIE, DON'T DO THIS.

07:11.264 --> 07:12.515
YOU ARE THE ONLY WOMAN
IN MY LIFE.

07:12.598 --> 07:14.225
THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS.

07:14.308 --> 07:16.352
- OH.

07:16.435 --> 07:20.523
DIANNE IN ACCOUNTING?

07:20.606 --> 07:22.400
- [sighs]

07:25.069 --> 07:26.487
- MM. YOU'RE RIGHT!

07:26.571 --> 07:31.576
PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY
IS BETTER WITH TRUFFLES.

07:31.659 --> 07:33.244
- WHAT'S
WITH ALL THE <i> COSMOS?</i>

07:33.327 --> 07:34.912
- OH, THERE'S AN ARTICLE
ABOUT VICTORIA.

07:34.996 --> 07:37.373
SHE'S CONVENIENTLY MARKED IT
WITH A POST-IT.

07:37.456 --> 07:39.750
- "VICTORIA CHASE'S
FABULOUS 40s."

07:39.834 --> 07:42.253
WOW,
SHE LOOKS GREAT FOR 45.

07:42.336 --> 07:45.673
- MM. SHE LOOKS REALLY GREAT
FOR [bleep].

07:45.756 --> 07:48.176
OH, MY GOD,
THAT JUST SLIPPED OUT.

07:48.259 --> 07:49.719
PLEASE,
YOU CAN'T SAY ANYTHING.

07:49.802 --> 07:51.262
- NO PROB.

07:51.345 --> 07:52.680
I KNOW WOMEN ARE
A LITTLE "SENSI"

07:52.763 --> 07:54.182
ON THAT SUBJECT.

07:54.265 --> 07:55.892
- THANK YOU.

07:55.975 --> 07:58.060
- HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING
SATURDAY NIGHT?

07:58.144 --> 08:00.104
- ACTUALLY, IT'S
OUR MONTHLY GAME NIGHT.

08:00.188 --> 08:02.023
I COULD USE A GOOD PARTNER.

08:02.106 --> 08:03.900
MELANIE'S GOT ALEC,
AND SHE'S ALWAYS BRAGGING

08:03.983 --> 08:05.860
ABOUT HOW BRILLIANT HE IS.

08:05.943 --> 08:07.278
- YEAH, ALEC'S PRETTY GOOD,
I GUESS,

08:07.361 --> 08:10.448
AS LONG
AS HE'S NOT UNDER PRESSURE.

08:10.531 --> 08:11.866
DON'T TELL ANYONE,

08:11.949 --> 08:14.785
BUT ALEC CHOKED ON <i> JEPS.</i>

08:14.869 --> 08:16.913
- "JEPS"?

08:16.996 --> 08:19.040
-<i> JEOPARDY!</i>
HE WAS A CONTESTANT.

08:19.123 --> 08:20.208
TOTALLY FROZE.

08:20.291 --> 08:22.418
ENDED UP WITH THE LOWEST
SCORE IN <i> JEPS</i> HISTORY--

08:22.501 --> 08:27.548
NEGATIVE 6,800.

08:27.632 --> 08:29.508
HE WAS--HE WAS SO UPSET,
HE BURST INTO TEARS.

08:29.592 --> 08:32.094
EVEN ALEX TREBEK
WAS EMBARRASSED.

08:32.178 --> 08:34.429
- OH, MY GOD,
HOW HUMILIATING.

08:34.514 --> 08:37.265
YOU KNOW,<i> JEOPARDY!</i> IS
ONE OF MELANIE'S FAVORITE SHOWS,

08:37.350 --> 08:38.768
EVEN THOUGH
SHE'S TERRIBLE AT IT.

08:38.851 --> 08:40.436
EVERY TIME
THEY ANSWER CORRECTLY,

08:40.519 --> 08:42.270
SHE'S ALL,
"HOW DO THEY KNOW THAT STUFF?"

08:42.355 --> 08:45.191
- SO SHE'S NOT VERY "INTEL."
- NO, SHE'S VERY "INTEL."

08:45.274 --> 08:48.778
SHE'S JUST MORE INTO <i> WHEEL.</i>

08:51.030 --> 08:52.240
- "WHEEL"?

08:52.323 --> 08:53.282
- IT'S <i> WHEEL OF FORTUNE.</i>

08:53.366 --> 08:56.077
I-I JUST SHORTENED IT.

08:56.160 --> 08:57.245
- HUH.

08:57.328 --> 09:02.500
NEVER HEARD IT "ABBREVED"
LIKE THAT.

09:02.583 --> 09:05.294
- WELL, YOU BETTER SHOVE
A PHONE BOOK DOWN YOUR PANTS

09:05.378 --> 09:08.756
'CAUSE YOU'RE GONNA GET
YOUR ASS KICKED, O.B.B.

09:08.839 --> 09:12.093
I LOVE YOU TOO, MAN.

09:12.176 --> 09:14.470
WELL, IT HAPPENED.
FRIENDS ARE DATING FRIENDS.

09:14.553 --> 09:16.013
JOY INVITED BILL
TO GAME NIGHT.

09:16.097 --> 09:17.932
- OH,
I THINK THAT'S GREAT!

09:18.015 --> 09:20.142
WHY DO YOU CALL BILL
O.B.B.?

09:20.226 --> 09:21.936
- OH, IT'S--
IT'S NOTHING.

09:22.019 --> 09:24.647
NO, IT'S JUST
A NICKNAME THING.

09:24.730 --> 09:27.817
[meekly]
I DON'T KNOW.

09:27.900 --> 09:30.820
- THAT IS THE WORST COVERING UP
I HAVE EVER SEEN.

09:30.903 --> 09:32.780
- OKAY, LOOK,
I SHOULDN'T HAVE MENTIONED IT.

09:32.863 --> 09:33.990
CAN WE JUST LET IT GO?

09:34.073 --> 09:35.825
- ALEC,
I'M YOUR GIRLFRIEND!

09:35.908 --> 09:37.660
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO TELL ME STUFF.

09:37.743 --> 09:40.454
- OKAY.
OKAY, I WILL TELL YOU.

09:40.538 --> 09:42.790
BUT YOU HAVE TO SWEAR
THAT YOU WILL TELL NO ONE.

09:42.873 --> 09:45.835
- OKAY.
I SWEAR, I SWEAR.

09:45.918 --> 09:47.670
SO WHAT DOES O.B.B. MEAN?

09:47.753 --> 09:50.881
- "ONE BALL BILL"?

09:59.932 --> 10:01.726
- WELL, I PROMISED
I WOULDN'T SAY ANYTHING,

10:01.809 --> 10:03.185
BUT I REALLY THOUGHT
YOU SHOULD KNOW,

10:03.269 --> 10:05.896
JUST IN CASE YOU AND BILL
END UP...YOU KNOW,

10:05.980 --> 10:09.650
SO YOU WON'T BE
TOTALLY SURPRISED.

10:09.734 --> 10:11.027
- IT DOESN'T BOTHER ME.

10:11.110 --> 10:13.404
WELL, I KNOW MEN
ARE QUITE ATTACHED TO THEM.

10:13.487 --> 10:14.989
BUT LET'S BE HONEST.

10:15.072 --> 10:16.365
AESTHETICALLY SPEAKING,

10:16.449 --> 10:20.202
IT'S NOT EXACTLY
A PEACOCK PLUME.

10:20.286 --> 10:21.579
- YOU KNOW,
IN TERMS OF NUMBERS,

10:21.662 --> 10:24.832
I THINK ONE IS HEADING
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

10:24.915 --> 10:26.500
YOU KNOW, IT'S
NOT LIKE YOU EVER THINK,

10:26.584 --> 10:29.920
"OOH, I WISH
THERE WERE MORE OF THOSE."

10:32.340 --> 10:34.717
- OKAY, JOY, I TOLD YOU
A SECRET ABOUT BILL.

10:34.800 --> 10:37.094
BUT NOW I NEED YOU
TO FIND OUT SOMETHING FOR ME.

10:37.178 --> 10:39.597
ALEC CONFESSED
THAT I'M NOT THE ONLY WOMAN

10:39.680 --> 10:41.098
HE'S DATED
AT THE OFFICE.

10:41.182 --> 10:43.726
AND HE WON'T TELL ME WHO SHE IS!
- I'M ON IT.

10:43.809 --> 10:45.603
- BUT BILL CAN'T KNOW
YOU'RE ASKING FOR ME.

10:45.686 --> 10:47.438
- OH, PLEASE,
I'M MATA HARI.

10:47.521 --> 10:49.607
SECRETS ARE MY BUSINESS.

10:49.690 --> 10:52.193
IN FACT, BILL TOLD ME
A JUICY ONE

10:52.276 --> 10:53.903
ABOUT ALEC
BEING ON <i> JEOPARDY!</i>

10:53.986 --> 10:56.697
- HE WAS?
I LOVE <i> JEOPARDY!</i>

10:56.781 --> 11:00.451
HOW DO THEY KNOW
ALL THAT STUFF?

11:00.534 --> 11:03.245
- WELL,
SOMETIMES THEY DO,

11:03.329 --> 11:04.955
AND SOMETIMES
THEY CHOKE.

11:05.039 --> 11:08.417
DON'T TELL ALEC
I TOLD YOU, BUT...

11:08.501 --> 11:11.504
ONE TIME ON <i> JEPS...</i>

11:14.507 --> 11:16.634
- THE BOTTOM LINE IS,
WHEN CHLOE LEFT,

11:16.717 --> 11:17.968
SHE TOOK HALF OUR CLIENTS.

11:18.052 --> 11:20.054
SO ARE WE GONNA LET THAT
STOP US?

11:20.137 --> 11:23.057
[cell phone buzzes]

11:23.140 --> 11:26.060
- NINE?

11:26.143 --> 11:28.229
SORRY, I JUST, UM--

11:28.312 --> 11:29.855
WHEN I'M PASSIONATE
ABOUT SOMETHING,

11:29.939 --> 11:32.775
I SPEAK GERMAN.

11:32.858 --> 11:37.321
- OKAY, WELL, ON THAT NOTE,
LET'S ADJOURN FOR TODAY.

11:37.405 --> 11:38.864
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

11:38.948 --> 11:41.492
KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK.

11:41.575 --> 11:44.120
- BY THE WAY, ALEC,
LOVE THE SOUL PATCH.

11:44.203 --> 11:45.246
- WELL, THANK YOU, KATHY.

11:45.329 --> 11:47.456
HMM.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.667
- BOY, THAT KATHY SURE PITCHED
A FEW CLUNKERS, HUH?

11:49.750 --> 11:50.918
- I NEVER DATED KATHY.

11:51.001 --> 11:53.462
- OH, IN THAT CASE, SHE MADE
A NUMBER OF EXCELLENT POINTS.

11:53.546 --> 11:55.631
- MELANIE, DON'T DO THIS.

11:55.714 --> 11:57.425
PLEASE LET IT GO,
FOR YOUR SAKE AND FOR OURS.

11:57.508 --> 11:58.801
- I'M SORRY.

11:58.884 --> 12:00.469
IT'S NOT SOMETHING
I LIKE ABOUT MYSELF,

12:00.553 --> 12:03.431
BUT SOMETIMES I GET
A LITTLE JEALOUS AND INSECURE.

12:03.514 --> 12:05.141
- WELL,
YOU HAVE NO REASON TO BE.

12:05.224 --> 12:09.311
YOU ARE ALL I WANT.

12:09.395 --> 12:10.646
- WOW.

12:10.729 --> 12:14.358
THAT PATCH SURE IS GROWING IN,
ISN'T IT?

12:14.442 --> 12:17.278
MMM. BILL, THESE APPETIZERS
ARE DELICIOUS.

12:17.361 --> 12:20.823
- HOT APPS
ARE MY THING.

12:20.906 --> 12:23.993
CAN YOU TASTE
MY SECRET "INGREED"?

12:24.076 --> 12:28.956
- IS IT TRUFFLES?

12:29.039 --> 12:31.834
- "TRUFF" REDUCTION,
ACTUALLY.

12:31.917 --> 12:33.210
- [softly]
THIS WHOLE MEAL

12:33.294 --> 12:35.880
COULD USE
A LITTLE "TRUFF" REDUCTION.

12:35.963 --> 12:38.799
- LET ME GET YOU
ANOTHER VODKA TONIC, ELKA.

12:38.883 --> 12:40.176
IT'S THE LEAST
I CAN DO

12:40.259 --> 12:41.802
FOR THE LITTLE SHARK
WHO GOT ME A PART

12:41.886 --> 12:43.846
IN THE NEXT TARANTINO MOVIE.

12:43.929 --> 12:47.975
OH, ELKA, THANK YOU,
THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

12:48.058 --> 12:52.188
- YOU'RE WELCOME,
YOU'RE WELCOME, YOU'RE WELCOME.

12:52.271 --> 12:56.358
SHE DIDN'T GET THE PART.

12:56.442 --> 12:57.526
- WHAT?

12:57.610 --> 12:59.737
- OH, I DEMANDED
TOO MUCH MONEY.

12:59.820 --> 13:03.199
I WAS DRUNK WITH POWER.

13:03.282 --> 13:04.742
- WHEN ARE YOU GOING
TO TELL HER?

13:04.825 --> 13:10.039
- AS SOON AS I GET DRUNK
WITH VODKA.

13:10.122 --> 13:13.876
HERE'S MY LITTLE STAR.

13:13.959 --> 13:15.211
- HOW ABOUT A TOAST
TO THE CHEF?

13:15.294 --> 13:18.088
- WHO ALSO HAPPENS
TO BE...

13:18.172 --> 13:19.924
UM, UM,
I'M TOO MODEST.

13:20.007 --> 13:21.217
JOY, WHY DON'T YOU TELL 'EM?

13:21.300 --> 13:22.551
- BILL JUST GOT NAMED--

13:22.635 --> 13:25.054
- CLEVELAND'S
MOST ELIGIBLE BACHELOR!

13:25.137 --> 13:27.348
- WAIT.
SERIOUSLY?

13:27.431 --> 13:28.724
- AWESOME, RIGHT?

13:28.807 --> 13:30.226
AND THEY'RE REALLY STEPPING IT
UP THIS YEAR--

13:30.309 --> 13:32.895
SUPER BOWL TIX.

13:32.978 --> 13:34.939
- SUPER BOWL TICKETS?

13:35.022 --> 13:36.857
ALL I EVER GOT WAS
A DISCOUNT DUNKIN' DONUTS CARD

13:36.941 --> 13:39.777
AND A FREE EYE EXAM.

13:39.860 --> 13:41.362
- YEAH, I GAVE THAT STUFF
TO MY DAD.

13:41.445 --> 13:44.406
- BUT YOU'VE GOT
THE REAL PRIZE....

13:44.490 --> 13:48.118
ME.

13:48.202 --> 13:51.205
- OF COURSE I DO.

13:51.288 --> 13:54.250
- SO LET'S PLAY.
- WE'LL GO FIRST.

13:54.333 --> 13:55.709
- OKAY, SO THE RULES.

13:55.793 --> 13:56.961
YOU PICK A TITLE
OF SOMETHING,

13:57.044 --> 13:58.587
AND THEN YOU DRAW
A PICTURE.

13:58.671 --> 14:00.422
- LIKE IF I DREW
A BOWL WITH A CAPE,

14:00.506 --> 14:03.926
THAT MIGHT BE SUPER BOWL.

14:04.009 --> 14:05.844
- I GET IT.

14:05.928 --> 14:07.930
- OKAY, ROUND.

14:08.013 --> 14:10.266
ROUND, ROUND, AROUND--
<i>AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS.</i>

14:10.349 --> 14:11.350
- YES!
- WOW.

14:11.433 --> 14:12.351
- YAY, JOY!

14:12.434 --> 14:14.144
- WHAT? NO, YOU DON'T "YAY"
THE OTHER TEAM.

14:14.228 --> 14:16.480
- IT'S YOUR TURN, ELKA.
- OH, OH.

14:16.564 --> 14:19.275
- BOY, JOY PLAYS
TO WIN, HUH?

14:19.358 --> 14:20.609
MUST BE NICE.

14:20.693 --> 14:22.570
- DON'T WORRY.

14:22.653 --> 14:27.157
I'VE NEVER WON THIS GAME,
SO I'M DUE.

14:27.241 --> 14:31.704
- SHARON...STONE...

14:31.787 --> 14:32.997
GOT YOUR PART.

14:33.080 --> 14:35.291
- YES!

14:39.837 --> 14:42.256
- HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN?
YOU SAID IT WAS A LOCK!

14:42.339 --> 14:45.968
YOU SAID THAT YOU WENT
ALL ARI GOLD ON THEIR ASS!

14:46.051 --> 14:49.722
- IT TURNED OUT <i> ENTOURAGE</i>
WAS ALL MADE UP.

14:51.223 --> 14:54.310
I'M SORRY, VICTORIA.

14:54.393 --> 14:57.646
- WELL, I GOT
TO GO CALL MY AGENT...

14:57.730 --> 15:00.941
MY REAL AGENT.

15:02.776 --> 15:07.156
- WAIT TILL SHE FINDS OUT
SHE LOST <i> KIMMEL.</i>

15:07.239 --> 15:09.158
- [sighs]
VICTORIA'S SO UPSET.

15:09.241 --> 15:10.326
MAYBE WE SHOULD STOP PLAYING.

15:10.409 --> 15:11.493
- NO!
- NO!

15:11.577 --> 15:14.496
- OKAY, THEN I'M UP.

15:14.580 --> 15:16.832
OKAY.

15:16.915 --> 15:19.877
- UH...IT'S A MAN.

15:19.960 --> 15:21.337
<i>MAN OF LA MANCHA.</i>

15:21.420 --> 15:23.172
UH, NO.
JESTER HAT?

15:23.255 --> 15:24.715
<i>SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE.</i>

15:24.798 --> 15:26.550
UH, BASEBALL?

15:26.634 --> 15:28.010
<i>THE NATURAL.</i>
- TIME'S UP.

15:28.093 --> 15:29.970
- WHAT WAS IT?
WAS I CLOSE?

15:30.054 --> 15:31.055
- KIND OF.

15:31.138 --> 15:34.433
<i>BRIDGET JONES'S DIARY.</i>

15:41.440 --> 15:43.525
- WHAT?
- IT'S A JUGGLER.

15:43.609 --> 15:46.737
SHE HAS TO JUGGLE MEN
AND CAREER AND PARENTS.

15:46.820 --> 15:48.364
- OH, THAT'S GOOD.

15:48.447 --> 15:51.158
- [mouths]

15:51.241 --> 15:52.034
- HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO KNOW IT'S A JUGGLER,

15:52.117 --> 15:53.202
WITH ONLY ONE BALL?

15:53.285 --> 15:54.370
ONE BALL IS USELESS.

15:54.453 --> 15:57.081
IF YOU ONLY HAVE ONE BALL,
YOU MIGHT AS WELL HAVE NO BALLS.

15:57.164 --> 16:00.000
- [laughs]
OOP. HMM.

16:00.084 --> 16:04.546
- WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

16:04.630 --> 16:07.216
OH, MY GOD!

16:07.299 --> 16:09.218
YOU TOLD MELANIE
ABOUT O.B.B.?

16:09.301 --> 16:11.428
- YOU TOLD JOY
ABOUT O.B.B.?

16:11.512 --> 16:13.222
- ONLY BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT HER
TO BE SURPRISED

16:13.305 --> 16:15.724
IF AND WHEN
THE ISSUE EVER CAME UP,

16:15.808 --> 16:18.268
WHICH WE'RE ALL ROOTING FOR!

16:18.352 --> 16:21.021
- BILL, I AM TOTALLY FINE
WITH ONE--

16:21.105 --> 16:23.023
MORE THAN FINE.
IT'S BETTER REALLY.

16:23.107 --> 16:26.568
THE LESS, THE MERRIER.

16:26.652 --> 16:28.028
- SEE, SHE LOVES IT.

16:28.112 --> 16:29.738
SO LET'S JUST
KEEP PLAYING, OKAY?

16:29.822 --> 16:30.906
OKAY.

16:30.989 --> 16:33.784
SO, BALL--
BILL...

16:33.867 --> 16:35.202
IT'S YOUR TURN.

16:35.285 --> 16:38.831
- NO PROB.
LET'S GET BACK TO PICS.

16:44.878 --> 16:46.547
- UH, IT'S A MAN.

16:46.630 --> 16:49.425
WITH TEARS.

16:49.508 --> 16:51.427
- OH, OH, I KNOW THIS!

16:51.510 --> 16:52.970
IT'S ALEC ON <i> JEOPARDY!</i>

16:53.053 --> 16:55.222
-<i> THE CRYING GAME.</i>
- YES!

16:55.305 --> 16:57.766
- YOU SWORE YOU'D NEVER TELL
ANYBODY ABOUT <i> JEOPARDY!</i>

16:57.850 --> 16:59.893
- LIKE YOU SWORE YOU'D NEVER
TELL ANYONE ABOUT O.B.B.!

16:59.977 --> 17:03.147
- AGAIN, I'M THRILLED
WITH JUST THE ONE.

17:03.230 --> 17:05.898
- WELL,
THIS IS A DISASTER.

17:05.983 --> 17:08.444
MY AGENT SAID THAT THERE'S
NO WAY I CAN GET THAT PART BACK,

17:08.527 --> 17:10.570
AND I CAN'T AFFORD
TO LOSE PARTS.

17:10.654 --> 17:13.156
AS AN ACTRESS,
I HAVE A LIMITED SHELF LIFE.

17:13.240 --> 17:14.157
- TAKE IT EASY, VIC.

17:14.241 --> 17:18.369
YOU LOOK "INCRED"
FOR [bleep].

17:20.873 --> 17:22.290
- BILL!

17:22.374 --> 17:25.294
- OH, JOY SCROGGS,
HOW COULD YOU?

17:25.377 --> 17:28.464
WE NEVER SAY THAT NUMBER!
NOT EVEN TO EACH OTHER.

17:28.547 --> 17:30.924
WELL, THIS MAKES
ALL THE WORD SHORTENING

17:31.008 --> 17:32.760
AND THE UGLY SOUL PATCHES

17:32.843 --> 17:35.679
AND MELANIE'S CORNBALL
SEX MUSIC LOOK LIKE NOTHING.

17:35.763 --> 17:37.181
- WHAT'S WRONG
WITH WORD SHORTENING?

17:37.264 --> 17:40.476
IT'S MORE "EXPEDISH."

17:40.559 --> 17:42.644
- IT CAN BE
THE TINIEST BIT ANNOYING.

17:42.728 --> 17:44.438
- WELL,
THAT'S A LITTLE PICKY.

17:44.521 --> 17:45.814
NO WONDER YOU HAVE
BAD LUCK WITH MEN.

17:45.898 --> 17:48.650
- ALEC, I TOLD YOU THAT
IN CONFIDENCE!

17:48.734 --> 17:50.944
- YOU TOLD ALEC
I HAVE BAD LUCK WITH MEN?

17:51.028 --> 17:52.279
- COME ON, JOY.

17:52.362 --> 17:55.657
ANYBODY
COULD HAVE SAID THAT.

17:57.785 --> 17:59.661
- MELANIE, YOU SAID
THAT YOU LOVED MY SOUL PATCH.

17:59.745 --> 18:01.622
- AND YOU SAID
YOU LOVED JOHN MAYER.

18:01.705 --> 18:03.874
<i>YOUR BODY IS A WONDERLAND</i>
IS CORNBALL SEX MUSIC?

18:03.957 --> 18:05.667
- WELL, THE "YOUR"
IS NOT SPECIFIC.

18:05.751 --> 18:07.419
IT SOUNDS LIKE
HE'S SINGING IT TO ME.

18:07.503 --> 18:09.296
- SOMEBODY'S A LITTLE BIT
INTO THEMSELF.

18:09.379 --> 18:10.464
- SOMEBODY WHO USED
TO BE

18:10.547 --> 18:12.007
CLEVELAND'S
MOST ELIGIBLE "BACH."

18:12.090 --> 18:13.300
- YOU ONLY WON THAT

18:13.383 --> 18:14.176
BECAUSE MELANIE MADE ME
DROP OUT.

18:14.259 --> 18:16.804
- MADE YOU? SEE?
YOU ARE UPSET ABOUT IT.

18:16.887 --> 18:18.138
JUST ADMIT IT!

18:18.222 --> 18:19.515
AND ADMIT THE TRUTH
ABOUT THE NINE OTHER WOMEN

18:19.598 --> 18:20.641
YOU'VE SLEPT WITH
AT THE OFFICE!

18:20.724 --> 18:22.893
- NINE?
- I DIDN'T WRITE "NINE"!

18:22.976 --> 18:27.689
I WROTE "NINA."
STUPID AUTOCORRECT.

18:27.773 --> 18:28.816
- IT WAS NINA?

18:28.899 --> 18:31.026
NINA WITH THE PARKING SPACE
CLOSEST TO THE BUILDING?

18:31.109 --> 18:32.236
WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO BE ON <i> JEOPARDY!</i>

18:32.319 --> 18:34.196
TO KNOW HOW SHE GOT THAT.

18:34.279 --> 18:35.823
- SEE,
SHE'S NOT SO STUPID.

18:35.906 --> 18:39.660
- [gasps]

18:39.743 --> 18:41.370
YOU SAID I WAS STUPID?

18:41.453 --> 18:43.914
- NO, I SAID YOU WERE
MORE INTO <i> WHEEL</i> THAN <i> JEPS.</i>

18:43.997 --> 18:44.832
- MELANIE, DON'T LET
YOUR JEALOUSY

18:44.915 --> 18:45.874
AND YOUR INSECURITY GET
THE BEST OF YOU.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.668
- OH, AND WHO SAID
I WAS JEALOUS AND INSECURE?

18:47.751 --> 18:49.586
- YOU DID!

18:49.670 --> 18:52.381
- WELL, YOU DIDN'T HAVE
TO REPEAT IT!

18:52.464 --> 18:54.842
AND IF I ACTUALLY WERE
ON <i> WHEEL</i> RIGHT NOW,

18:54.925 --> 18:55.801
I WOULD BUY A VOWEL

18:55.884 --> 18:58.387
AND PUT SOME
IMPOLITE CONSONANTS AROUND IT

18:58.470 --> 19:03.058
AND THEN ADD
THE WORD "YOU"!

19:03.141 --> 19:04.434
- YOU CAN'T ADD WORDS
ON <i> WHEEL OF FORTUNE!</i>

19:04.518 --> 19:09.231
- I JUST PLAY
TO HAVE FUN!

19:09.314 --> 19:12.234
[door slams]

19:12.317 --> 19:15.654
- THIS NEVER HAPPENS
ON <i> PASSWORD.</i>

19:23.662 --> 19:25.622
- SEE, THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN FRIENDS DATE FRIENDS.

19:25.706 --> 19:28.917
- OH, SO NOW IT'S MY FAULT!
- WELL, IT'S NOT MY FAULT.

19:29.001 --> 19:33.922
[both sigh]

19:34.006 --> 19:36.758
SO I GUESS
THIS IS OUR FIRST FIGHT.

19:36.842 --> 19:38.927
- I GUESS SO.

19:39.011 --> 19:40.262
I HATE FIGHTING.

19:40.345 --> 19:41.972
I PREFER TO KEEP THINGS
TO MYSELF

19:42.055 --> 19:44.600
AND LET 'EM SIMMER
FOR 15, 20 YEARS.

19:44.683 --> 19:45.934
- I'M A BOLTER.

19:46.018 --> 19:50.272
THERE'S NO PROBLEM
I CAN'T RUN AWAY FROM.

19:50.355 --> 19:53.066
- SO WHY AREN'T YOU
RUNNING AWAY NOW?

19:53.150 --> 19:58.322
- I'M FULL OF TRUFFLE BUTTER
AND TRUFFLE WINE.

19:58.405 --> 20:01.408
AND I'M CRAZY ABOUT YOU.

20:01.491 --> 20:05.329
- I'M CRAZY ABOUT YOU TOO.

20:05.412 --> 20:07.956
I'M REALLY SORRY I MADE YOU
GIVE UP THE BACHELOR THING.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.583
I GUESS I'M JUST WORRIED,
YOU KNOW,

20:09.666 --> 20:11.793
THAT--THAT YOU STILL WANT
TO BE ELIGIBLE.

20:11.877 --> 20:13.837
- NO, NO. I-I DON'T WANT
TO BE ELIGIBLE.

20:13.921 --> 20:15.631
I THINK I JUST LIKED
THE BRAGGING RIGHTS

20:15.714 --> 20:17.799
OF THE BACHELOR THING.

20:17.883 --> 20:20.510
TRUTH IS
I LOVE BEING WITH YOU,

20:20.594 --> 20:22.221
AND I WANT
THE WORLD TO KNOW.

20:22.304 --> 20:23.847
IN FACT,
I'VE BEEN THINKING

20:23.931 --> 20:26.141
WE SHOULD TELL EVERYONE
AT THE OFFICE ABOUT US.

20:26.224 --> 20:27.684
- I'D LIKE THAT.

20:27.768 --> 20:29.394
MM.
[smooches]

20:29.478 --> 20:31.188
AND I'M REALLY GETTING USED
TO THE SOUL PATCH.

20:31.271 --> 20:33.315
- NO, YOU'RE NOT.
I'LL SHAVE TOMORROW.

20:33.398 --> 20:35.275
- OR TONIGHT, YOUR CHOICE.
[both chuckle]
