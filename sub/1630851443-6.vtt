- You are not
gonna blackmail me.

00:10.034 --> 00:15.275
- You do what I say or I
will fuck your life up.

00:15.275 --> 00:17.758
- BLUE: Previously on
"All the Queen's Men."

00:17.758 --> 00:19.241
- Hereús a brief on a motion

00:19.241 --> 00:22.000
I want you to file
in Judge Ross's court.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.551
- I can't do that.
- This is not a request.

00:24.551 --> 00:26.379
- Allen's wife, she
skipped town last night.

00:26.379 --> 00:28.310
Kat says there's a detective.

00:28.310 --> 00:30.137
- I'm looking for
Marilyn Deville.

00:30.137 --> 00:32.965
- I'm Madam. Is there
something I can help you with?

00:32.965 --> 00:34.482
- I need to ask you
a couple of questions

00:34.482 --> 00:36.551
about your business partner,
Allen Fisk.

00:36.551 --> 00:37.620
- Really?

00:43.137 --> 00:47.379
- Did Mr. Fisk say or do
anything that was out of

00:47.379 --> 00:48.793
character the last
time you saw him?

00:50.689 --> 00:54.241
- Not that I can think of.
He was himself.

00:54.241 --> 00:57.413
- His wife says he's been
missing for several days.

00:57.413 --> 01:01.413
- Come to think of it, I
haven't heard from him either.

01:01.413 --> 01:03.068
The last time we spoke,

01:03.068 --> 01:06.172
he was pressed about
an urgent business matter.

01:06.172 --> 01:09.172
- You know if that
was in or out of town?

01:09.172 --> 01:13.517
- Didn't say. But whatever
it was, it was important.

01:13.517 --> 01:14.827
- Hm.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
Okay.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.344
Well, I guess that's it for now.

01:26.344 --> 01:28.206
If there's anything that
you can think of that may be

01:28.206 --> 01:31.931
of some significance,
please give me a call.

01:31.931 --> 01:36.689
- Will do. Davis.
- Thank you.

01:42.034 --> 01:45.103
- I don't like this.
- It's okay.

01:45.103 --> 01:47.586
- No, this shit ain't.
- What?

01:47.586 --> 01:51.620
Just hit up Kat,
see what she knows.

01:51.620 --> 01:54.689
- It's that wife of his.
We need to find her.

01:54.689 --> 01:57.689
- I agree.
- Madam...

01:57.689 --> 02:02.172
- Look, Blue, I'mma need
you to calm down, okay?

02:02.172 --> 02:06.137
- Okay.
- Look, hit up Fuego, all right?

02:06.137 --> 02:09.068
See if he can help
find Tina's whereabouts.

02:09.068 --> 02:10.448
- Okay.

02:10.448 --> 02:13.862
- And do me a favor.
Get some cameras.

02:13.862 --> 02:17.344
Put 'em up around here, but
very discreetly, all right?

02:17.344 --> 02:18.724
I don't know what
the fuck is going on,

02:18.724 --> 02:21.137
but something does
not feel right.

02:21.137 --> 02:25.413
- Mm, what you think it is?
- I don't know.

02:25.413 --> 02:27.103
Someone's fucking
with me, though, Blue.

02:27.103 --> 02:29.965
Seriously.
First it was my father.

02:29.965 --> 02:32.206
Now this shit?

02:32.206 --> 02:34.931
Look, somebody is
up to something.

02:34.931 --> 02:36.206
- [sighs]

02:36.206 --> 02:39.793
- I'm trying to remain calm.

02:39.793 --> 02:43.931
But we need to figure out
who the fuck it is...soon.

02:43.931 --> 02:46.862
- All right, I'm on it.
- Mm-hmm.

02:46.862 --> 02:48.344
Blue.

02:48.344 --> 02:49.931

tell me everything?

04:57.827 --> 05:01.310

I need to know.

It states in a police report
that he was left unattended

08:37.379 --> 08:38.448
and wandered off.

08:38.448 --> 08:39.862

- Ms. Deville, I know you
don't have an attorney.

08:41.896 --> 08:44.724
But you gonna have to stand
quietly until I ask questions.

08:44.724 --> 08:46.413

You also have four affidavits
from the elder Ms. Deville

08:48.413 --> 08:52.586

wandered off, left alone again.

to say for yourself?

08:56.896 --> 08:59.172

I was out.

08:59.172 --> 09:00.655
- JUDGE: Out where?

09:00.655 --> 09:02.586
- I went to the store for him.

09:02.586 --> 09:05.034
- And there was no one to attend
to him while you were gone.

09:05.034 --> 09:07.000
- I was only gone for a minute.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.724

disappeared.

09:22.586 --> 09:24.413
- And where were you
the day he disappeared?

09:24.413 --> 09:25.862

guardianship over her father.

that may be a good idea.
