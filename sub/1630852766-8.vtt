about paige young,
a former playboy playmate,

11:36.930 --> 11:41.466
who had killed herself in 1974.

11:41.568 --> 11:43.735
That was common knowledge.

11:43.837 --> 11:51.409
But this article had a lot of
new information about her death.

11:51.511 --> 11:55.213
I was surprised to read
about the scene

11:55.315 --> 12:00.218
where there's a whole mural
of hugh hefner.

12:00.320 --> 12:02.854
I thought it was a big deal,

12:02.956 --> 12:04.556
and it made me wonder,
what did he do?

12:04.658 --> 12:11.496
What happened that caused her
to focus on hugh hefner so much?

12:11.598 --> 12:16.568
In the suicide note, it has
listed men that she felt

12:16.670 --> 12:19.904
she'd been abused by,
including hugh hefner

12:20.006 --> 12:25.510
and the director john huston,
who was a major cultural icon.

12:25.612 --> 12:31.716
In the early '70s, when they
were filming "chinatown,"

12:31.818 --> 12:35.286
the cast and crew would hang out
a lot at the playboy mansion.

12:35.388 --> 12:38.823
So there is a chance huston
spent time at the mansion

12:38.925 --> 12:40.425
during the filming.

12:40.527 --> 12:44.295
Paige told me that member

12:44.397 --> 12:49.334
of his playboy mansion
entourage or whatever it was,

12:49.436 --> 12:53.538
had filmed her having sex.

12:53.640 --> 12:59.077
Paige was so over the top
upset about that tape.

12:59.179 --> 13:01.780
This was the end of the world
for her.

13:01.882 --> 13:08.086
She didn't seem that shy,
you know, about sex,

13:08.188 --> 13:12.757
and it made me wonder,
what was on that tape?

13:12.859 --> 13:14.259
What I actually keep thinking is

13:14.361 --> 13:18.596
there's more on that
than just sex.

13:18.698 --> 13:20.965
Hef--he had tapes on everybody.

13:21.067 --> 13:23.234
The first time I looked up
at the two screens he had

13:23.336 --> 13:25.804
for the tv in the bedroom,

13:25.906 --> 13:28.773
and I realized that was me,
and I'm like,

13:28.875 --> 13:30.742
"whoa, what are you doing?"

13:30.844 --> 13:34.412
and when we started bringing
other people into the bedroom,

13:34.514 --> 13:38.416
some girls had the same reaction
like, "whoa,"

13:38.518 --> 13:40.218
and he would--
he would do the...

13:40.320 --> 13:42.654
"oh, well, I can turn it off.

13:42.756 --> 13:46.491
If it's not okay,
I'll turn it off."

13:46.593 --> 13:49.093
and they go, "oh, no.
Yeah, would you turn it off?"

13:49.196 --> 13:51.262
and he would...

13:52.265 --> 13:55.400
And then he would say,
"now we can just see it.

13:55.502 --> 13:57.202
That's all it--you know,
we're just seeing it.

13:57.304 --> 13:59.137
We're not recording."

13:59.239 --> 14:03.141
and maybe a week later,
a couple days later,

14:03.243 --> 14:06.044
all of a sudden,
there's the tape.

14:06.146 --> 14:07.979
He told you that
you weren't recording this.

14:08.081 --> 14:10.548
He goes, "you think
I really stopped it?"

14:10.650 --> 14:15.720
so he did it anyway,
and he had tapes on everybody.

14:15.822 --> 14:20.124
Hefner taped everything
in his bedroom,

14:20.227 --> 14:24.462
and many men and stars
and athletes

14:24.564 --> 14:28.099
came into the bedroom
and had sex with these girls.

14:28.201 --> 14:32.036
Most of the time,
hefner never participated.

14:32.138 --> 14:33.738
He just watched.

14:33.840 --> 14:36.140
He was a voyeur.

14:36.243 --> 14:37.809
He would stage them.

14:37.911 --> 14:41.112
He thought of himself
as a film director.

14:41.214 --> 14:43.715
He didn't want to be
on the tapes.

14:43.817 --> 14:47.252
He wanted these girls
and the stars.

14:47.354 --> 14:49.854
But many of the girls
were devastated

14:49.956 --> 14:52.423
after what they
were expected to do,

14:52.525 --> 14:54.425
what they were forced to do.

14:54.527 --> 14:57.962
Well, can you imagine
after he had all these tapes

14:58.064 --> 15:02.267
of you having sex
with different girls,

15:02.369 --> 15:06.137
what power you had
over these men?

15:06.239 --> 15:09.240
These are some, uh, notes
I took

15:09.342 --> 15:14.545
around the time I worked
for playboy, and, um,

15:14.648 --> 15:16.814
the first one--

15:16.917 --> 15:18.449
the tony curtis incident

15:18.551 --> 15:22.520
about tapes and lawyers
storming the mansion.

15:22.622 --> 15:25.056
Tony was a regular
at the mansion,

15:25.158 --> 15:28.760
and he went
with several playmates.

15:28.862 --> 15:32.497
Tony was upset
and maybe didn't realize

15:32.599 --> 15:38.803
that hef was filming...
The--the orgy.

15:38.905 --> 15:40.238
So his attorneys--

15:40.340 --> 15:44.575
they were very upset
that tony had been filmed.

15:44.678 --> 15:46.177
They wanted them.

15:46.279 --> 15:51.916
Hefner kept these tapes
in a tape library.

15:52.018 --> 15:56.454
The librarian's office was
down the hall from the bedroom.

15:56.556 --> 16:02.527
That was off-limits to anybody
except hef and mary o'connor.

16:02.629 --> 16:05.363
If you were caught
going near it

16:05.465 --> 16:09.801
or talking to the librarian,
you would be terminated.

16:09.903 --> 16:14.672
People around the world
read "playboy" magazine.

nirvana for men,

16:19.446 --> 16:22.246

with all these women,

16:22.349 --> 16:24.816

have to pay for it.

that he was basically...
A predator.

18:33.780 --> 18:38.950
I was a member of hugh hefner's
executive protection team

18:39.052 --> 18:42.520

you're also expected
to protect them from anything

24:30.470 --> 24:34.071
I knew bill cosby for six years.

24:34.173 --> 24:37.174
He was a friend.
Nothing more but a friend

24:37.276 --> 24:40.211
that I would see
on the playboy circuit.

24:40.313 --> 24:43.614
Nine months or so after
I had gotten to chicago

24:43.716 --> 24:44.715
as the bunny mother,

24:44.817 --> 24:48.285
uh, bill cosby was doing
an interview

24:48.387 --> 24:50.521
in the playmate lunchroom.

24:50.623 --> 24:52.957
Later that day,
he called me, and he said,

24:53.059 --> 24:55.226
"listen, you want to go out
to dinner tomorrow night?"

24:55.328 --> 24:57.194
I said, "sure."

24:57.296 --> 24:59.263
he says, "well, meet me
at the whitehall hotel,

24:59.365 --> 25:01.532
and we'll go out to dinner."
I said, "sure."

25:01.634 --> 25:04.134
I didn't think anything of it
'cause I knew this person.

25:04.237 --> 25:08.005
So the next night,
I met him at 7:00,

25:08.107 --> 25:09.440
and he was in the penthouse.

25:09.542 --> 25:11.075
So he said to me,
"well, come on up,

25:11.177 --> 25:13.978
and we'll have a drink
before we go to dinner."

25:14.080 --> 25:18.482
I went upstairs, and he says,
"what would you like to drink?"

25:18.584 --> 25:21.752
so I said,
"I'll take a grand marnier."

25:21.854 --> 25:23.988
and he gave me the glass.
I took two sips,

25:24.090 --> 25:25.589
and that's the last thing
I remember

25:25.691 --> 25:28.526
until 4:00 the next morning.

25:28.628 --> 25:31.428
And I woke up in bed naked,

25:31.531 --> 25:34.331
and I looked to my left,
and there he was naked,

25:34.433 --> 25:38.669
sleeping next to me,
and I was in a panic.

25:38.771 --> 25:41.906
And I slivered out of the bed

25:42.008 --> 25:45.342
to try to collect my clothes
that were all over the floor,

25:45.444 --> 25:50.180
and I had blood coming down
my leg 'cause he sodomized me.

25:50.283 --> 25:53.083
And blood was
dripping on the floor.

25:53.185 --> 25:57.087
And, um... [voice breaking]
I put my clothes on,

25:57.189 --> 25:58.556

cover me, and I went to work.

26:31.591 --> 26:34.592
And about 11:00 in the morning,
he calls my office.

26:34.694 --> 26:36.894
How he got that private line,
I don't know.

26:36.996 --> 26:38.495
It was a private line.
[sniffles]

26:38.598 --> 26:41.365

"why did you leave?"

26:41.467 --> 26:43.767

"are you kidding me?"

26:43.869 --> 26:46.503

the floor. I'm doing my work."

26:51.811 --> 26:58.515
I hung up the phone, and I was
in complete, total shock.

26:58.618 --> 27:04.788
That next day I called my boss,
and I told her that he raped me

27:04.890 --> 27:08.993

and her reply was,

27:09.095 --> 27:12.029
"that's hefner's best friend.

to go out with him.

27:24.143 --> 27:27.277
I couldn't go to hefner
because there were a lot

27:27.380 --> 27:31.448
of very strange things
happening up at the mansion.

27:31.550 --> 27:33.717

27:33.819 --> 27:35.486
Who's gonna listen to me?

27:35.588 --> 27:38.389
I knew nothing
would have changed.

27:38.491 --> 27:40.491
I knew he wouldn't
have been held accountable.

27:40.593 --> 27:43.227
It was bill cosby.

27:49.802 --> 27:52.102
I had no avenue to go down.

27:52.204 --> 27:56.940
There were other celebrities
and vips

27:57.043 --> 27:59.176
that were at the, uh,
l.A. Mansion

27:59.278 --> 28:01.445
that would definitely drug

28:01.547 --> 28:04.415
and sexually assault
young women.

28:04.517 --> 28:06.984
Roman polanski, of course,
who we know

28:07.086 --> 28:10.054
to be someone
who fled the country

28:10.156 --> 28:12.956
after raping a very young girl,
allegedly, right,

28:13.059 --> 28:14.224
is somebody who's a fixture

28:14.326 --> 28:16.026
at the playboy mansion
at one point.

28:16.128 --> 28:19.563
So what kind of people we choose
to surround ourselves with

28:19.665 --> 28:21.799
says something about who we are.

28:27.106 --> 28:29.606
My name's charlotte lewis,

28:29.709 --> 28:35.913
and I did the cover
of "playboy" in 1994, June.

28:36.015 --> 28:37.514
I suddenly found out how close

28:37.616 --> 28:41.552
roman polanski and hugh hefner
really were,

28:41.654 --> 28:44.955
and I did find that
a bit disturbing.

28:45.057 --> 28:51.428
In 1977, polanski was
convicted of rape of a minor,

28:51.530 --> 28:54.298
and the minor was 13 years old.

28:54.400 --> 28:57.367
The girl was two weeks short
of 14.

28:57.470 --> 29:02.406
But if you have seen her, uh,
sitting here next to me,

29:02.508 --> 29:05.976
you wouldn't be
particularly shocked by it.

29:06.078 --> 29:08.212
As a matter of fact, you would
find it completely normal.

29:08.314 --> 29:10.114
But I'd be particularly
concerned to find out

29:10.216 --> 29:12.449
how old she was,
and you actually did know.

29:12.551 --> 29:14.084
-You actually did know.
-Yeah, I knew. I knew.

29:14.186 --> 29:15.652
I knew she was 14
because she was talking

29:15.755 --> 29:17.254
about her birthday before that.

29:17.356 --> 29:19.990
Then I met him five,
five and a half years later,

29:20.092 --> 29:22.559
six years later.

29:22.661 --> 29:27.898
I was, uh, raped by
roman polanski when I was 16.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
It took a long time for me
to realize

29:30.102 --> 29:33.737
that what had happened to me
wasn't my fault,

29:33.839 --> 29:36.640
because I always thought
it was my fault.

29:36.742 --> 29:38.308
You don't realize at the time
when something's--

29:38.410 --> 29:40.177
when you're very young,

29:40.279 --> 29:44.314
that what's happened is--
is illegal or--or wrong.

29:44.416 --> 29:46.016
You know it's wrong
'cause it doesn't feel right.

29:46.118 --> 29:51.188
There are some men that
obviously, of a generation,

29:51.290 --> 29:56.827
yes, feel that there is
some...Entitlement

29:56.929 --> 30:01.498
and that women are just the sex,
you know, objects.

30:01.600 --> 30:03.600
It's about the control,
really, isn't it?

30:03.702 --> 30:06.837
It's amazing there is
still some kind of protection

30:06.939 --> 30:08.972

these men,

30:09.074 --> 30:14.411
these--these debauched
human beings, you know?

30:14.513 --> 30:17.981
I would be up at the game house
with hef a lot,

30:18.083 --> 30:20.918
and the conversations
could get very heavy,

30:21.020 --> 30:24.288
and--and roman polanski
was one of the stories,

30:24.390 --> 30:26.557
and I would listen to them talk.

30:26.659 --> 30:30.761
It was, "gah, he got caught!"

with a young girl.

30:35.734 --> 30:37.367

He had the drugs.
He had the liquor.

what is it about playboy that

So I started cutting myself--

cutting my arms,
cutting my legs.

It's a weird thing that happens
