WEBVTT

00:01.291 --> 00:03.583
I don't know. They're okay...

00:03.667 --> 00:07.542
I wish they were available in
a darker shade of black, though.

00:07.625 --> 00:09.834
How 'bout these?

00:09.917 --> 00:11.625
(scoffs)
This is how you see me?

00:11.709 --> 00:13.875
A guy who wears boxy glasses
like an idiot?

00:13.959 --> 00:15.542
A boxy-glassed idiot?

00:15.625 --> 00:16.917
Hmm...

00:17.000 --> 00:18.542
He left them
in Edie's bed again.

00:18.625 --> 00:20.875
Give me, give me, give me,
give me, give me.

00:20.959 --> 00:23.166
You're welcome.

00:23.250 --> 00:26.166
Yeah. Oh, yeah. See?
Sophisticated yet playful.

00:26.250 --> 00:27.875
(phone chimes)

00:27.959 --> 00:29.792
(Sara giggles)

00:29.875 --> 00:31.875
What? Let me see.

00:31.959 --> 00:34.333
W... You going out
with Ryan again? Whoo...

00:34.417 --> 00:36.125
It's not Ryan. It's Brian.

00:36.208 --> 00:37.917
Wait, there might be
a Ryan also.

00:38.000 --> 00:39.667
Anyway, this is Scott.

00:39.750 --> 00:42.250
He's very promising.
His sister is my accountant.

00:42.333 --> 00:44.000
Sounds like a write-off to me.
(chuckles)

00:44.083 --> 00:45.917
I literally came up with that
right now.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.291
Literally right now?

00:47.375 --> 00:48.417
Wow.

00:48.500 --> 00:49.917
Your accountant's a woman?

00:50.000 --> 00:52.375
Um, yes.
With a hot brother.

00:52.458 --> 00:55.834
Oh. Oh.
Well, you know what they say.

00:55.917 --> 00:57.208
Small boat...

00:57.291 --> 00:58.291
(phone rings)

00:58.375 --> 01:00.083
...small dinghy.

01:00.166 --> 01:02.583
(chuckles) See, the beauty
of the small dinghy joke,

01:02.667 --> 01:03.917
you didn't see it coming.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.041
Came out of nowhere.

01:05.125 --> 01:06.125
Yeah.

01:06.208 --> 01:07.542
They want me
to come down there.

01:07.625 --> 01:10.041
I'm an emergency contact.

01:10.125 --> 01:12.959
Am I an emergency contact?
I mean, I'm the most
important man

01:13.041 --> 01:14.709
in her life.
Besides her father.

01:14.792 --> 01:16.542
I mean, he plays
a certain role, too.

01:16.625 --> 01:18.041
I should go with you.

01:18.125 --> 01:20.709
Yes. Fine. Whatever.

01:20.792 --> 01:22.375
Oh, you know what?
They called me, too.

01:22.458 --> 01:23.917
They-they tried me
three times, so...

01:24.041 --> 01:25.291
Ten times,
actually, so...

01:25.375 --> 01:27.291
That's great! You win!
It's so weird.

01:27.375 --> 01:29.959
I wonder why they couldn't reach
Vanessa and Gerald.

01:30.041 --> 01:32.959
Look at us. Right? Phones off
so we can focus on the app

01:33.041 --> 01:34.959
we created to help
co-parent our kid.

01:35.041 --> 01:37.375
Best parents ever.
(grunts)

01:37.458 --> 01:39.291
(trilling, grunting)

01:39.375 --> 01:42.000
(chuckles)

01:42.083 --> 01:43.333
(both mimic beeping
and funky music)

01:43.417 --> 01:45.959
We spent too much time
rehearsing that.

01:46.041 --> 01:49.500
Now we're hunkering down.
We're ready to rock.

01:49.583 --> 01:50.959
Uh, so here's
how the app works.

01:51.041 --> 01:52.125
The app helps par...

01:52.208 --> 01:53.125
Ravi?

01:53.208 --> 01:54.709
Sorry, still on that handshake.

01:54.792 --> 01:55.959
I was thinking
I could improve upon it,

01:56.041 --> 01:57.166
but I like what you guys
are doing.

01:57.250 --> 01:58.834
I'm all ears.

01:58.917 --> 02:00.709
The app helps parents
who don't live together

02:00.792 --> 02:02.959
coordinate their kids' lives.
Like schedules...

02:03.041 --> 02:04.625
Appointments.

02:04.709 --> 02:07.458
I came up with the idea,
and I also came up with the idea

02:07.542 --> 02:09.208
for Gerald to do all the work
making it.

02:09.291 --> 02:10.542
We are a very good team.

02:10.625 --> 02:12.000
Color me impressed.

02:12.083 --> 02:13.667
I have an eye
for this kind of thing.

02:13.750 --> 02:15.250
You guys have the next Google
on your hands.

02:15.333 --> 02:16.458
Oh! I knew it.

02:16.542 --> 02:18.000
Google?
(chuckles) Yeah,

02:18.083 --> 02:19.959
it's just a prototype
that lives on my computer.

02:20.041 --> 02:21.667
Time-out. Prototype? Computer?

02:21.750 --> 02:22.917
Um, that's how Google started.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.667
Keep going.

02:24.750 --> 02:26.083
we would need some investor
money for stuff like

02:26.166 --> 02:27.625
software and server space.

02:27.709 --> 02:30.125
Stickers, hoodies,
water bottles.
Yeah.

02:30.208 --> 02:31.333
Well, you are in luck.

02:31.417 --> 02:32.709
You ever heard
of a guy named

02:32.792 --> 02:34.417
Kirk Kelly?

02:34.500 --> 02:35.917
He helped launch
ChurchHookups.com

02:36.000 --> 02:37.917
and-and PornGarbage.
You know him?

02:38.000 --> 02:39.417
Do I know him? (chuckles)

02:39.500 --> 02:41.041
Yeah, we were in the
same pledge class together:

02:41.125 --> 02:43.083
Chi Psi, AKA the frat
that loved Adam Sandler movies

02:43.166 --> 02:45.625
and partying.
Yeah, Kirk and I are bros.

02:45.709 --> 02:49.083
We text on the regs.

02:49.166 --> 02:50.709
Unfortunately,
I'm out of texts this month.

02:50.792 --> 02:53.709
But... you guys are worth
the seven cents.

02:53.792 --> 02:55.041
I'm on it.

02:55.125 --> 02:56.500
(chuckles)

02:56.583 --> 02:58.291
Yo, man.
(chuckles)

02:58.375 --> 02:59.291
Oh, no, no, and then
it's a left.

02:59.375 --> 03:00.792
(both trilling)

03:00.875 --> 03:02.458
(sputtering)
Your rhythm's way off.

03:02.542 --> 03:03.458
You're better than this.

03:03.542 --> 03:04.458
Sorry.

03:04.542 --> 03:05.458
Thank you, Ravi!

03:05.542 --> 03:08.458
♪ ♪

03:08.542 --> 03:09.750
(slurps)

03:09.834 --> 03:12.041
Mmm!

03:12.125 --> 03:13.834
Now, that is good maté.

03:13.917 --> 03:16.041
Thank you for coming down
today, Sara.

03:16.125 --> 03:17.208
And who are you?

03:17.291 --> 03:18.625
Oh, I'm Edie's other
emergency contact.

03:18.709 --> 03:20.417
No, he's not.

03:20.500 --> 03:21.959
Different truths.

03:22.041 --> 03:23.875
Anyway,
I'm sure you're wondering

03:23.959 --> 03:26.583
why you're here. Edie is fine.

03:26.667 --> 03:28.125
She was just bitten
by another child.

03:28.208 --> 03:29.792
What?!

03:29.875 --> 03:31.208
Honey!

03:31.291 --> 03:33.166
She's a monster now.

03:33.250 --> 03:35.583
Oh, no,
it goes away when you rub it.

03:35.667 --> 03:36.375
SARA: What?

03:36.458 --> 03:38.458
What little sicko did this?

03:38.542 --> 03:39.917
Bring him in here.

03:40.000 --> 03:40.792
Or her.

03:40.875 --> 03:42.083
Oh, so it's a her.

03:42.166 --> 03:43.250
No, I'm just pointing out

03:43.333 --> 03:45.166
the sexism in your phraseology.

03:45.250 --> 03:46.291
Yeah, Sara, get
with the times.

03:46.375 --> 03:48.083
Even some accountants are women.

03:48.166 --> 03:49.291
Just tell us who did this,
so we can speak

03:49.375 --> 03:51.083
to the parents and work it out.

03:51.166 --> 03:54.041
Well, obviously I can't share
the biter's identity.

03:54.125 --> 03:56.667
I'm sorry?

03:56.750 --> 03:59.083
These incidents,
they're teachable moments

03:59.166 --> 04:01.709
that we prefer
to handle internally.

04:01.792 --> 04:04.000
That way the biter
doesn't feel less than.

04:04.083 --> 04:05.250
"Less than"?
Someone bit Edie.

04:05.333 --> 04:07.875
There is less Edie.

04:07.959 --> 04:09.542
Well, didn't break skin, so...

04:09.625 --> 04:11.375
This is unbelievable.
In my day--

04:11.458 --> 04:13.125
wow, I can't believe
you just made me say

04:13.208 --> 04:14.834
"in my day"--
school policy

04:14.917 --> 04:16.709
did not prevent
parents from

04:16.792 --> 04:18.041
protecting their children...

04:18.125 --> 04:19.834
so you're starting
to raise your voice

04:19.917 --> 04:21.291
because you're getting angry...

04:21.375 --> 04:22.583
No, that's how she always talks.

04:22.667 --> 04:25.125
Right now,
you're at an orange-red.

04:25.208 --> 04:29.125
What do you think we can do
to get you down to green?

04:29.208 --> 04:31.417
Oh...

04:31.500 --> 04:32.500
the chart's helping.

04:32.583 --> 04:33.583
Yee-haw!

04:33.667 --> 04:35.125
Dad cow...

04:35.208 --> 04:37.166
say binary code is the
language of love.

04:37.250 --> 04:38.500
Who says that?

04:38.583 --> 04:39.709
Programmers.

04:39.792 --> 04:41.125
RAVI: Gerald!

04:41.208 --> 04:42.792
There you are.
First off, sweet pad.

04:42.875 --> 04:45.125
I rock that exact same futon.
More importantly,

04:45.208 --> 04:48.125
didn't you get my 50 texts?
That's, like, four bucks, man.

04:48.208 --> 04:49.417
Yeah, yeah.
We're staying offline

04:49.500 --> 04:51.125
until we make
some real progress.

04:51.208 --> 04:53.166
Guys, I've got great news.

04:53.250 --> 04:55.000
I got you that meeting
with Kirk Kelly!

04:55.083 --> 04:57.166
This Friday, 2:00.

04:57.250 --> 04:58.583
Oh.
Uh...

04:58.667 --> 05:00.291
Yeah... uh, Friday,
that's only three days

05:00.375 --> 05:01.750
to get the app
fully functional, though.

05:01.834 --> 05:02.959
And prepare a pitch.

05:03.041 --> 05:06.709
Oy vey, as the Jews say.

05:06.792 --> 05:08.917
I gotta say, this isn't
the reception I expected.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.166
I thought I'd be getting sprayed
with champagne right now.

05:11.250 --> 05:13.208
I brought these goggles.

05:13.291 --> 05:14.959
Ravi, this is amazing.
Thank you. Okay?

05:15.041 --> 05:16.417
We'll be ready by Friday.
Thank you.

05:16.500 --> 05:18.458
Yes.

05:18.542 --> 05:21.208
practice your presentation on me
this Thursday.

05:21.291 --> 05:23.166
Now, with that said,
I'm gonna get out of your hair,

05:23.250 --> 05:25.417
because you kids have
a<i> lot </i>of work to do.

05:25.500 --> 05:26.667
Thank you, Ravi!

05:26.750 --> 05:29.166
Hey.

05:29.250 --> 05:31.417
Why do you have my baby?

05:31.500 --> 05:33.291
What?

05:33.375 --> 05:35.875
They called us both down,
so, you know...

05:35.959 --> 05:38.208
they have some touchy-feely
policy not to tell us

05:38.291 --> 05:41.208
which kid did it, so we are
powerless to protect Edie.

05:41.291 --> 05:44.375
Uh...

05:44.458 --> 05:47.166
Yeah. It's progressive.
So, you know,

05:47.250 --> 05:49.458
they do things differently than
when we were back at school.

05:49.542 --> 05:51.709
Freaking millennials.

05:51.792 --> 05:53.333
You should've seen her face
down at the school.

05:53.417 --> 05:55.250
Total orange-red. Ow.

05:55.333 --> 05:56.917
The important thing is
is that Edie's okay.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.709
And let's just trust
the school to handle this

05:58.792 --> 06:00.583
the Cricket Canyon way
and-and make sure

06:00.667 --> 06:02.208
that Edie doesn't
get bitten again.

06:02.291 --> 06:04.041
She got bitten again!

06:04.125 --> 06:06.583
Cricket freaking Canyon!

06:06.667 --> 06:08.333
Now can we handle this my way?

06:08.417 --> 06:11.542
Hey, hey! Enjoy a tasty app
while you work on your app.

06:11.625 --> 06:13.959
It's not really an app, it's
an entree, but I used "app"

06:14.041 --> 06:16.375
for the jo... I'm still
not on the contact list?!

06:16.458 --> 06:17.750
What's it gonna take?

06:20.875 --> 06:22.250
Well, I'm mad about Edie, too.

06:22.333 --> 06:23.750
I'm mad about two things.

06:26.834 --> 06:30.333
Edie, we really need to
know who's been biting you,

06:30.417 --> 06:32.709
so we can talk to their
parents and make it stop.

06:32.792 --> 06:35.041
Right. So we're gonna
ask you one more time

06:35.125 --> 06:36.917
who it is, okay?
And don't say...

06:37.000 --> 06:38.041
Santa.

06:38.125 --> 06:39.917
...Santa!

06:40.000 --> 06:41.542
Maybe we need
to change schools.

06:41.625 --> 06:43.750
This is the worst week
for this to happen.

06:43.834 --> 06:45.291
I guess we got
to cancel the pitch, right?

06:45.375 --> 06:46.709
You are not canceling the pitch.

06:46.792 --> 06:48.166
You are not changing schools.

06:48.250 --> 06:49.875
You let me handle this.
I'll find the biter.

06:49.959 --> 06:52.125
Yeah, and I'm gonna help her.
No matter what we have to do.

06:52.208 --> 06:54.208
(humming cheerfully)

06:54.291 --> 06:55.709
Any ideas on what
we should do?

06:55.792 --> 06:57.083
(Edie humming)

06:57.166 --> 06:58.792
EDIE: Santa.

06:58.875 --> 07:00.792
It is so great
that you volunteered

07:00.875 --> 07:02.750
to be Helper Crickets
today.

07:02.834 --> 07:03.834
Of course.

07:03.917 --> 07:04.834
We love the school,

07:04.917 --> 07:05.834
and we just want to do our part.

07:05.917 --> 07:06.834
Right, Jimmy?

07:06.917 --> 07:08.458
Yeah. Chirp, chirp.

07:08.542 --> 07:10.250
That's what crickets say.
(chirring): Cricket!

07:10.333 --> 07:14.291
A cricket can make whatever
sound you want it to make.

07:14.375 --> 07:15.875
Okay.

07:15.959 --> 07:18.375
It makes a very specific sound.

07:18.458 --> 07:20.250
Hey, kid. Hey.

07:20.333 --> 07:22.750
You like candy?
Well, I like names.

07:22.834 --> 07:24.750
Which one of these punks
bit Edie?

07:24.834 --> 07:26.500
(shrieks)

07:26.583 --> 07:28.834
That's your plan--
shaking down toddlers?

07:28.917 --> 07:31.208
I'm being perfectly reasonable.
I'm just trying to get a name

07:31.291 --> 07:32.750
so we can talk
to the kid's parents.

07:32.834 --> 07:34.583
Oh, but if you're
not comfortable

07:34.667 --> 07:36.583
with the duties
of an emergency contact...

07:36.667 --> 07:38.875
I see what you're doing here.
Don't try to bait me

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
into participating
in your chicanery,

07:41.083 --> 07:42.792
in your tomfoolery, in your...

07:42.875 --> 07:45.792
"On Tuesday,
Hungry Hedgehog ate one cupcake,

07:45.875 --> 07:47.875
two carrots,
and bit a classmate on the arm."

07:47.959 --> 07:50.667
Has anyone here bit
a classmate on the arm? Anyone?

07:50.750 --> 07:52.792
That's not how the book goes.

07:52.875 --> 07:54.583
Well, when you're
the Helper Cricket,

07:54.667 --> 07:56.000
you can read the book
any way you want.

07:56.083 --> 07:57.417
I hate you.

07:57.500 --> 07:58.792
Hey, sweetie.

07:58.875 --> 07:59.959
Let's solve
a mystery together.

08:00.041 --> 08:01.792
Do you know who bit Edie?

08:01.875 --> 08:05.291
My cat bit my dog and my dog
yelled like this: (howls)

08:05.375 --> 08:08.125
All right, that's great.
Get out of here. Next.

08:08.208 --> 08:11.792
So... this is what
the biter looks like, huh?

08:11.875 --> 08:13.917
I can work with this.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.291
Mm-hmm.

08:15.375 --> 08:16.792
SARA:
<i>Hi, sweetie. Let's solve</i>

08:16.875 --> 08:19.500
a mystery together.
Do you know who bit Edie?

08:19.583 --> 08:20.834
Maybe a ghost?

08:20.917 --> 08:22.125
Is this a joke to you?

08:23.542 --> 08:24.625
Smile.

08:25.917 --> 08:26.834
Did you bite Edie?

08:26.917 --> 08:27.917
Hey!

08:29.709 --> 08:31.750
I like swinging, don't you?

08:31.834 --> 08:34.250
You like biting?
You ever just, uh, bite a kid?

08:35.625 --> 08:37.125
You're right--
this didn't work.

08:37.208 --> 08:39.375
Guess I forgot
how stupid kids are.

08:39.458 --> 08:42.542
Sorry you came up empty, but
I've got some promising leads.

08:42.625 --> 08:44.625
GIRL: I heard you're
looking for a biter.

08:45.917 --> 08:47.792
I'll sing for you.

08:47.875 --> 08:49.834
But it don't come cheap.

08:49.917 --> 08:51.917
Oh, my God, she's the same age
as the rest of them,

08:52.000 --> 08:53.417
yet she speaks like us.

08:53.500 --> 08:54.834
This is really cool.

08:54.917 --> 08:56.834
What do you want for it, kid?

08:56.917 --> 08:58.834
My name is Clementine.

08:58.917 --> 08:59.917
And I want a sand castle.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.834
A good one.

09:01.917 --> 09:05.875
But you better be quick,
because recess is almost over.

09:05.959 --> 09:08.375
How are you at sand castles?

09:08.458 --> 09:11.375
(humming a tune)

09:11.458 --> 09:12.875
Nice moat work.

09:12.959 --> 09:15.041
When did you get so good
at building sand castles?

09:15.125 --> 09:16.667
I've always been artistic.
I'm just shy about it.

09:16.750 --> 09:18.041
Oh, that's right,

09:18.125 --> 09:21.667
I forgot what a sensitive
creature you are.

09:21.750 --> 09:23.709
You have a bandage in your hair.

09:23.792 --> 09:25.500
Ew! Yuck. Get it out,
get it out.

09:25.583 --> 09:26.875
Ooh, sorry.

09:26.959 --> 09:29.750
Don't worry,
I got you.

09:30.834 --> 09:31.875
Thank you.

09:31.959 --> 09:33.041
CLEMENTINE:
This'll do.

09:33.125 --> 09:35.041
This'll do just fine.

09:36.959 --> 09:38.083
Dragon attack!

09:38.166 --> 09:39.875
Oh!

09:39.959 --> 09:42.583
JIMMY: My moat, my moat!

09:42.667 --> 09:44.917
Hey, wait a minute--
we need a name.

09:45.000 --> 09:45.917
Who's the biter?

09:46.000 --> 09:47.750
Alex is!

09:47.834 --> 09:50.125
Alex.
Our work here is done.

09:50.208 --> 09:53.000
Wrong, rookie.
It's just begun.

09:53.083 --> 09:55.083
I like this side of you.

09:55.166 --> 09:57.834
You're like a badass chick
on<i> Criminal Minds </i>or something.

09:57.917 --> 09:59.917
All right entrepre-nerds,

10:00.000 --> 10:01.792
let's hear your pitch.

10:01.875 --> 10:03.834
Pretend I'm Kirk. Okay?

10:03.917 --> 10:05.917
Okay.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.125
Hi Kirk, nice to meet you...

10:07.208 --> 10:08.375
Stop right there.
Nice?

10:08.458 --> 10:09.583
You know what's nice?

10:09.667 --> 10:10.917
Homemade jam.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.709
Guys,
this is Kirk freaking Kelly.

10:12.792 --> 10:13.792
He<i> is </i>the jam.

10:13.875 --> 10:14.959
Not to mention my boy.

10:15.041 --> 10:16.000
Let's start over.

10:16.083 --> 10:17.458
Okay.

10:18.667 --> 10:20.750
Right.

10:20.834 --> 10:22.500
Hi, Kirk, it's an
honor to meet you...

10:22.583 --> 10:23.917
Stop. Don't suck up.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.583
Guys, come on!

10:25.667 --> 10:27.166
This ain't no disco.

10:27.250 --> 10:28.458
This ain't
no country club either.

10:28.542 --> 10:29.750
This is Kirk Kelly.

10:29.834 --> 10:31.458
Does he know that...

10:31.542 --> 10:33.041
You got to be on point.
You got to be on your toes.

10:33.125 --> 10:35.250
You got to think fa...
Aah! Ooh.

10:35.333 --> 10:36.959
That was impressively fast.

10:37.041 --> 10:39.166
Why are you being so
intense about this?

10:39.250 --> 10:40.959
I mean, if Kirk's your boy,
it shouldn't matter.

10:41.041 --> 10:43.250
If I have a son,
I'm gonna name him Kirk.

10:43.333 --> 10:44.959
And I'll never love him
as much as I love Kirk Kelly.

10:45.041 --> 10:46.959
Wh... You're
guaranteeing right now

10:47.041 --> 10:49.417
that if you have a kid, you will
love him less than Kirk Kelly.

10:49.500 --> 10:51.083
That's what I said.

10:51.166 --> 10:52.417
All right, now,
let's try this again

10:52.500 --> 10:53.834
from the top.
And by the way,

10:53.917 --> 10:55.959
it's "Kirk," not "Kirk."

10:56.041 --> 10:57.834
Uh, okay... Kirk.

10:57.917 --> 10:59.041
Better. Now think fast...

11:00.041 --> 11:01.333
(Ravi grunts, thuds)

11:01.417 --> 11:02.834
Thank you so much

11:02.917 --> 11:04.542
for having Alex over.

11:04.625 --> 11:07.166
It's rare the grandparents
host a playdate.

11:07.250 --> 11:08.291
It's not that rare.

11:08.375 --> 11:09.583
Yeah, it happens
all the time.

11:09.667 --> 11:11.875
I just have to ask, though:

11:11.959 --> 11:14.959
is Edie gonna stay
in the playpen the whole time?

11:15.041 --> 11:18.125
Oh, about that.
We may be old school,

11:18.208 --> 11:19.959
but we prefer Edie
to play with kids

11:20.041 --> 11:21.709
that don't try to eat her.

11:21.792 --> 11:24.542
I'm sorry?

11:24.625 --> 11:26.709
This whole playdate thing

11:26.792 --> 11:28.959
was a brilliant ruse.

11:29.041 --> 11:30.542
A playdate
with grandparents?

11:30.625 --> 11:32.583
Come on. Think, Brenda.

11:32.667 --> 11:35.250
I am so sorry. Alex,

11:35.333 --> 11:37.083
what did we say?

11:37.166 --> 11:40.000
If you acted out one more
time, no Disneyland.

11:40.083 --> 11:41.500
Maybe next year, bud.

11:41.583 --> 11:43.041
DAD:
This'll never happen again.

11:43.125 --> 11:44.709
I think Alex is misbehaving

11:44.792 --> 11:48.000
because his grandfather passed.

11:48.083 --> 11:50.125
That's why he hasn't
been in school all week.

11:52.500 --> 11:54.000
Edie was bitten
yesterday.

11:54.083 --> 11:56.875
Let it go.
We're in too deep.

11:56.959 --> 11:59.041
Alex, it's Mickey Mouse
on the phone.

11:59.125 --> 12:00.792
He says he's very
unhappy with you.

12:03.166 --> 12:04.625
Look at his eyes.

12:04.709 --> 12:06.166
Oh...

12:07.667 --> 12:09.875
I can't believe Clementine lied.

12:09.959 --> 12:12.250
Well, anyone who destroys
a castle that beautiful

12:12.333 --> 12:14.208
can't be trusted.

12:14.291 --> 12:16.166
So...  back to the school
tomorrow?

12:16.250 --> 12:18.458
Biter's got to be
out there somewhere.

12:18.542 --> 12:20.792
I don't know.
Maybe we should hang it up.

12:20.875 --> 12:22.000
Really?

12:22.083 --> 12:24.041
Yeah, we did the vigilante thing

12:24.125 --> 12:26.417
and just destroyed
a three-year-old's vacation.

12:26.500 --> 12:29.041
Well, don't worry, I slipped
Alex a 20 on his way out.

12:29.125 --> 12:30.250
SARA: Ugh.

12:30.333 --> 12:33.083
I'll talk to
the school again.

12:33.166 --> 12:34.625
It'll probably be fine.

12:34.709 --> 12:36.208
You think?

12:36.291 --> 12:38.458
This was kind of fun, though.

12:38.542 --> 12:41.083
Yeah, we did have fun.

12:41.166 --> 12:43.125
Who's that?
Who's that?

12:43.208 --> 12:46.291
Oh. Hey, hey!
Scott has docked,

12:46.375 --> 12:49.083
so looks like
tomorrow night is on.

12:49.166 --> 12:51.750
Oh, cool-- small boat guy.

12:51.834 --> 12:53.208
Whoo-hoo.

12:53.291 --> 12:55.417
Hello, Scotland Yard.

12:57.375 --> 13:00.375
Uh, it's a Sherlock Holmes
reference.

13:00.458 --> 13:02.125
No, no, no, no.
It's fine.

13:02.208 --> 13:03.792
Well, he's hot.
Leave me alone.

13:03.875 --> 13:06.291
Yeah, tomorrow's good.
I can't wait.

(laughs) Kirk, man.

13:21.875 --> 13:24.125
Dude, I'm glad you made it.
I was gonna tell you to Waze it

13:24.208 --> 13:26.750

No, I deserved it.

13:32.709 --> 13:34.125
I was being long-winded
and boring. Come here.

13:34.208 --> 13:36.125
Whoa.

13:36.208 --> 13:37.667
Hey, Kirk, it's so exciting
to meet you, man.

13:37.750 --> 13:40.709
What, you want an autograph
or something?

13:40.792 --> 13:43.125
Dude, calm down,
I'm not Jeremy Piven.

13:43.208 --> 13:45.917
Then no.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.750
What?

13:48.834 --> 13:50.125
And you don't have to
kiss my ass. Ravi's mom

13:50.208 --> 13:52.125
took care of that before
I got here, right?

13:52.208 --> 13:53.875
RAVI: Man, Kirk, when I don't
see you for a while,

13:54.000 --> 13:56.166
I kind of forget what
a skank my mom is. Classic.

13:56.250 --> 13:57.166
Incoming.

13:57.250 --> 13:59.083
Ooh.

13:59.166 --> 14:00.792
You like to be
on your knees, huh?

14:00.875 --> 14:02.667
Like my mom, right?
(laughs)

14:02.750 --> 14:04.291
Is he always like this?

14:04.375 --> 14:05.583
Like what-- hilarious?

14:05.667 --> 14:07.125
He seems like
he's the worst.

14:07.208 --> 14:08.959
Yeah, the worst
at not being the best.

14:09.041 --> 14:11.875
You know, you remind me
of my stepbrother.

14:11.959 --> 14:13.500
Oh, is he awesome?

14:13.583 --> 14:16.000
No, no, he's in jail
for stalking Oprah.

14:16.083 --> 14:19.041
Anyway, let's get inside
so you guys can buy me dinner.

14:19.875 --> 14:20.875
(quietly):
Yeah.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.333
Hey.

14:26.417 --> 14:28.709
ANNELISE: I need your credit
card so I can send Alex

14:28.792 --> 14:30.750
those anonymous
Disneyland tickets.

14:30.834 --> 14:32.375
Preschool yearbook?

14:32.458 --> 14:33.750
Eh, at least
you're reading.

14:33.834 --> 14:35.166
So close to catching this guy.

14:35.250 --> 14:36.709
Or girl.
The biter could be either sex.

14:36.792 --> 14:38.417
ANNELISE:
You're still on this?

14:38.500 --> 14:41.208
Yes, of course. I'm nothing
if not a champion of justice.

14:41.291 --> 14:42.625
You've stolen bathrobes

14:42.709 --> 14:44.250
from every luxury
hotel chain in America.

14:44.333 --> 14:46.083
Yeah, here, here,
here, here, here, here--

14:46.166 --> 14:47.500
Good-bye.
Thank you.

14:47.583 --> 14:49.792
I wish Sara was here
to help me.
Whatever.

14:49.875 --> 14:51.834
Just text me the address
for Alex's parents.

14:51.917 --> 14:53.500
Wait a minute.
Wait, wait, wait.

14:53.583 --> 14:55.041
Say that again.

14:55.125 --> 14:56.834
Which part?
Alex's parents.

14:56.917 --> 14:58.792
When I asked who the biter was,
Clementine said,

14:58.875 --> 15:01.208
"Alex is." Alex is. Alex is.

15:01.291 --> 15:04.000
Alex is. Alexis. Alexis.<i> Alexis! </i>

15:04.083 --> 15:05.208
Alexis!

15:05.291 --> 15:07.792
Aha!

15:07.875 --> 15:09.208
Gotcha.

15:09.291 --> 15:11.125
CoParentPro
isn't just gonna change

15:11.208 --> 15:12.834
the way single parents
communicate.

15:12.917 --> 15:15.208
It's gonna change the entire
concept of co-parenting.

15:15.291 --> 15:17.625
Not to mention
128-bit encryption

15:17.709 --> 15:19.458
and cloud syncing capability.

15:19.542 --> 15:21.458
Which are words I know.

15:21.542 --> 15:23.750
What did I tell you?
My girl's like Steve Wozniak!

15:23.834 --> 15:25.417
You're like Steve Blobs.

15:25.500 --> 15:27.500
(laughing):
Yeah, 'cause it's
like Steve Jobs.

15:27.583 --> 15:29.417
It's a good one.

15:29.500 --> 15:31.166
It's okay to laugh
when I'm funny.

15:31.250 --> 15:33.834
(forced laughter)

15:33.917 --> 15:36.291
It's classic!

15:36.375 --> 15:39.291
Um... but, uh,
you-you know, the beauty

15:39.375 --> 15:41.750
of CoParentPro is that
it seamlessly merges

15:41.834 --> 15:45.291
every aspect of childcare, so,
be it schedules, appointments,

15:45.375 --> 15:47.250
meals, schoolwork...

15:47.333 --> 15:48.709
So that even if both parents
aren't under the same roof,

15:48.792 --> 15:49.959
they'll be on...

15:50.041 --> 15:51.959
BOTH:
...the same page.

15:52.041 --> 15:53.583
It's like the next Google.

15:53.667 --> 15:54.792
I have a question.

15:54.875 --> 15:56.291
Please.
So...

15:56.375 --> 15:58.375
the two of you...

15:58.458 --> 16:00.417
had a baby together?

16:01.375 --> 16:03.083
Yeah.

16:03.166 --> 16:04.792
So, how did this happen?

16:04.875 --> 16:06.458
What, did he
<i>Revenge of the Nerds </i>you

16:06.542 --> 16:08.291
with a Darth Vader mask?

16:08.375 --> 16:10.792
Listen, Kirk, I don't know what
you're insinuating here,

16:10.875 --> 16:12.542
because I've only seen
<i>Nerds in Paradise...</i>

16:12.625 --> 16:14.667
Oh, don't get offended.
I'm just asking the question

16:14.750 --> 16:16.875
everyone who's ever met you
wants to know.

16:16.959 --> 16:18.291
Th-This is ridiculous.

16:18.375 --> 16:19.875
You're not even listening
to the pitch.

16:19.959 --> 16:21.291
Oh, you mean the pitch
that told me

16:21.375 --> 16:22.625
you have next
to no experience in tech,

16:22.709 --> 16:24.166
no proof-of-concept or sales,

16:24.250 --> 16:25.583
yet you're valuing your company
at 100K?

16:25.667 --> 16:27.291
So between all
those hilarious insults,

16:27.375 --> 16:28.959
you were listening.

16:29.041 --> 16:30.667
It's good multi-tasking.

16:30.750 --> 16:32.250
Well, now that you know
I am listening,

16:32.333 --> 16:33.667
why don't you pitch it out again

16:33.750 --> 16:35.542
and see if you can address
some of my concerns?

16:35.625 --> 16:37.291
(both laugh weakly)

16:37.375 --> 16:39.000
Hey! Finally.

16:39.083 --> 16:40.041
Where you been?

16:40.125 --> 16:41.875
I was in the shower.

16:41.959 --> 16:43.917
Are you the idiot who's been
calling every 30 seconds?

16:44.000 --> 16:45.917
No, I'm the idiot
who cracked the case.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.375
I got a name and an address.

16:47.458 --> 16:49.333
Seriously? That's amazing!

16:49.417 --> 16:50.667
Meet me in Hancock Park.

16:50.750 --> 16:52.333
We'll wait
for the biter's parents

16:52.417 --> 16:53.875
to come home, we'll give them
a good talking to.

16:53.959 --> 16:55.166
It'll be like
an old-fashioned stakeout.

16:55.250 --> 16:57.166
I have the Scott thing,
remember?

16:57.250 --> 16:59.583
Oh, right. Small boat guy.

16:59.667 --> 17:02.208
All right,
I guess I can fly solo.

17:02.291 --> 17:04.333
No, we're a team.
Send me the address.

17:04.417 --> 17:05.917
I've got an hour.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.583
And I'm doing my makeup
in the car!

17:07.667 --> 17:09.291
Great. I'll bring snacks.

17:09.375 --> 17:10.875
Ooh, I love snacks!

17:10.959 --> 17:12.917
(humming quietly)

17:13.000 --> 17:16.500
If I didn't know any better, I'd
say you're preparing for a date.

17:16.583 --> 17:20.083
Date? What? I'm not
preparing for a date.

17:20.166 --> 17:22.166
I'm making some
food for the car.

17:22.250 --> 17:24.375
You're grating a truffle, Jimmy.

17:24.458 --> 17:27.625
Are you implying that...?

17:27.709 --> 17:29.792
You need to lay off
the reefer, man.

17:29.875 --> 17:31.792
What?! Yeah, perhaps I should.

17:32.792 --> 17:33.792
Date.

17:33.875 --> 17:35.875
Have fun with Sara.

17:43.542 --> 17:46.291
SARA:
It's kind of a bummer
dating a guy with a boat

17:46.375 --> 17:48.250
'cause you can't wear
heels on the dock.

17:48.333 --> 17:50.583
I had to go with wedges.

17:51.917 --> 17:52.917
Is everything okay?

17:53.000 --> 17:54.709
You would never approve wedges.

17:54.792 --> 17:56.000
Yeah. No. I'm just...

17:56.083 --> 17:57.917
We need to stay focused now.

17:58.000 --> 18:01.291
I think Alexis's parents
should be home in 20 minutes.

18:01.375 --> 18:02.834
(laughs)
What?

18:02.917 --> 18:04.291
Can we really
call this a stakeout

18:04.375 --> 18:06.250
if we know exactly
when they're coming home?

18:06.333 --> 18:09.000
Not really.
It's more like
we're early.

18:09.083 --> 18:10.542
(laughing)
Right.
(laughs)

18:10.625 --> 18:12.083
What are we doing?

18:12.166 --> 18:14.250
We're in a parked car,
watching someone's house,

18:14.333 --> 18:17.667
eating prosciutto
di melone.
(laughs)

18:17.750 --> 18:19.375
I think
we're the crazy grandparents.

18:19.458 --> 18:21.041
You could make that argument.

18:21.125 --> 18:23.208
Here. Try the burrata.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.083
Oh, my God.

18:26.166 --> 18:28.000
That is amazing!
Mm-hmm.

18:28.083 --> 18:29.583
Would it be terrible to say

18:29.667 --> 18:32.041
that Edie getting bitten
was worth it for this food?

18:32.125 --> 18:33.667
Yes, that would
be terrible.

18:33.750 --> 18:35.166
(both laughing)

18:35.250 --> 18:36.875
What will you make
if she gets pushed off a swing?

18:36.959 --> 18:38.000
Oh.
(laughs)

18:38.083 --> 18:39.333
Crab cakes.

18:39.417 --> 18:41.792
Lemon aioli, pair it
with a nice Chardonnay.

18:41.875 --> 18:43.333
Not bad, not bad.

18:43.417 --> 18:45.083
I'm not hearing anything
about a dessert.
(chuckles)

18:45.166 --> 18:46.417
Mm!

18:46.500 --> 18:47.917
You know what I'd make?

18:48.000 --> 18:49.625

18:49.709 --> 18:53.000

Yup. It's time
for you to go, Kirk.

20:11.250 --> 20:12.291
What, are you serious?

20:12.375 --> 20:14.125
Yeah. Go away.

20:14.208 --> 20:15.166
Have a nice night.

20:15.250 --> 20:19.000
Don't tell me what to do.

20:19.083 --> 20:20.458
Aah! All right, look,
it's obvious

20:20.542 --> 20:22.458
you guys can't take
a joke, slash my jokes

20:22.542 --> 20:25.000

Well, we are not.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.959
What if I give you double
the seed money?

20:34.083 --> 20:35.875
It's too late, Kirk.
Get it through your skull.

20:35.959 --> 20:38.458
Yeah.

20:38.542 --> 20:39.583
right up...
BOTH:
We're in!

20:39.667 --> 20:40.417
What? What?

20:40.500 --> 20:44.166
Hug me, brother! Yes!

20:44.250 --> 20:45.792
It's the tech industry.

20:45.875 --> 20:47.250
We're gonna have to do
business with jerks.

20:47.333 --> 20:49.542
At least this jerk gave us
double our seed money.

20:49.625 --> 20:51.083
Yeah, I told you
you'd like him.

Well, Sara left, and I
didn't want to be a grown man

21:01.667 --> 21:04.250
sitting out alone in front
of a child's home.

21:04.333 --> 21:05.333
Oh!

21:06.959 --> 21:09.125
There's Alexis's
parents. Come on.

21:10.375 --> 21:13.709
Hey! Your kid bit
my granddaughter!

21:13.792 --> 21:17.208
Oh, well, that means your kid
spat in my kid's face!

21:17.291 --> 21:18.917
The school wouldn't
tell us who it was.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.083
Ah. Call it even, then?

21:21.166 --> 21:23.500
No, no, no, no-- what's
your granddaughter's name?

21:23.583 --> 21:25.291
Uh... Clementine.

21:25.375 --> 21:27.875
She hangs out
in the sandbox.

21:27.959 --> 21:30.208
Snitch had it coming.
