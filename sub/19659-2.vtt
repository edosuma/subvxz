00:05.767 --> 00:07.167
I think,
with your experience,

00:07.233 --> 00:08.700
you'll get something,
no problem.

00:08.767 --> 00:10.500
Also,
you're a handsome fella.

00:10.567 --> 00:11.400
Thank you.

00:11.467 --> 00:12.967
Oh, no, I'm not
coming on to you.

00:13.033 --> 00:14.267
I'm just saying it's easier

00:14.333 --> 00:16.400
to place attractive
people in advertising.

00:16.467 --> 00:20.233
Like, uh, last week,
we had this guy in,

00:20.300 --> 00:22.433
and he had a great CV
and tons of experience,

00:22.500 --> 00:25.433
but he also had an eye patch.

00:25.500 --> 00:28.300
[chuckle]
Like the pirate kind.

00:28.367 --> 00:30.167
Nowadays, you're not
even allowed to ask,

00:30.233 --> 00:31.667
like, "What happened
to your eye?"

00:31.733 --> 00:32.833
But you want to know.

00:32.900 --> 00:34.933
Oh, totally.
I'd be curious.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
Like, was he pulling
clothes out of the dryer

00:37.067 --> 00:38.833
and he pulled too hard
and his hand slipped

00:38.900 --> 00:40.233
and he punched himself
in the eye

00:40.300 --> 00:41.867
- while he was
holding his keys?
- Maybe.

00:41.933 --> 00:43.900
And then the other
thing is what's behind
the eye patch now?

00:43.967 --> 00:46.233
Like is it just a--
a gaping...

00:47.833 --> 00:48.967
Anyway, legally,

00:49.033 --> 00:52.100
you can't not hire
somebody like that,

00:52.167 --> 00:55.567
uh, but at the same time,
you're not gonna hire him.

00:55.633 --> 00:56.933
Right.

00:57.000 --> 01:01.567
Uh, so where have you been
the last 3 years?

01:01.633 --> 01:02.933
Have you been on holiday?

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
Uh, no. Uh,
I worked at Braeband--

01:06.067 --> 01:07.167
Ah.

01:07.233 --> 01:08.533
...the pharmaceutical
company, but, uh,

01:08.600 --> 01:10.200
it's a bit delicate.

01:10.267 --> 01:11.933
Oh. Well, let's hear it.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.133
Okay, uh,
a woman who worked there

01:15.200 --> 01:17.133
made a complaint
against me--

01:17.200 --> 01:19.400
sexual harassment,
but it's not true.

01:19.467 --> 01:21.067
I mean, it's very untrue.

01:21.133 --> 01:22.800
- Right.
- Um, and look,

01:22.867 --> 01:25.033
when a woman makes a complaint
of sexual harassment,

01:25.100 --> 01:27.700
99% of the time
it's based in reality.

01:27.767 --> 01:29.100
I know that, you know that.

01:29.167 --> 01:30.833
And it's important
to believe women

01:30.900 --> 01:33.067
because sometimes people
unfairly side with the man,

01:33.133 --> 01:35.067
you know, and why would
anyone side with the man?

01:35.133 --> 01:36.500
Well, I'll tell you
why, okay?

01:36.567 --> 01:38.267
Because
sometimes the man is me

01:38.333 --> 01:39.333
and it didn't happen.

01:39.400 --> 01:41.100
So procedurally,
I'm very glad

01:41.167 --> 01:42.933
that they heard
her side of the story,

01:43.000 --> 01:44.133
but the other side
of the coin

01:44.200 --> 01:46.433
is that she's a liar
and I didn't do it.

01:48.800 --> 01:50.333
Oh, you speak French.

01:50.400 --> 01:51.633
That's cool.

01:56.233 --> 01:57.600
This is nice, isn't it?

01:57.667 --> 01:59.167
This has gotta be
one of the perks

01:59.233 --> 02:00.200
of being unemployed, right?

02:00.267 --> 02:01.900
Doing this together.

02:01.967 --> 02:03.600
When was the last time
we did this?

02:05.000 --> 02:06.167
How'd your interview go?

02:06.233 --> 02:08.267
I don't know.
I don't know how it went.

02:08.333 --> 02:10.167
Well, it's gonna
take a while, isn't it?

02:10.233 --> 02:12.200
Yeah, I just hope
a while means 8 to 10 days

02:12.267 --> 02:14.000
and not we all die of scurvy

02:14.067 --> 02:15.067
because we can't afford
citrus.

02:15.133 --> 02:16.800
We're not gonna
die from scurvy

02:16.867 --> 02:17.933
because
I'm going back to work.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.433
Quite looking forward
to it, actually.

02:19.500 --> 02:21.200
It's gonna be nice
to be around kids

02:21.267 --> 02:23.033
who don't want to sit on my
lap when I take a piss.

02:23.100 --> 02:24.933
What about our kids?
What's the plan there?

02:25.000 --> 02:26.567
What's the plan there?

02:26.633 --> 02:28.567
The plan is what we said
the plan is. You'll do it.

02:28.633 --> 02:30.600
Yeah, I'll do it if you
don't want me to get a job.

02:30.667 --> 02:32.700
You know, we're gonna have
to get someone to help.

02:32.767 --> 02:34.133
What about Anna?
She's great.

02:34.200 --> 02:36.167
She's not great.
She has a pulse,

02:36.233 --> 02:37.667
and she knows
our kids' names--

02:37.733 --> 02:39.967
- one of our kids' names.
- Oh, come on.

02:40.033 --> 02:41.267
What? You don't
have to defend her

02:41.333 --> 02:42.900
just because she has
big jugs.

02:42.967 --> 02:44.133
Does she have big jugs?

02:44.200 --> 02:46.700
[laugh] Look, it's just
drop-offs and pick-ups.

02:46.767 --> 02:48.267
Do your interviews
in between.

02:48.333 --> 02:50.133
And then, when you get a job,
we'll make a better plan.

02:50.200 --> 02:51.733
We just need
to get organized.

02:51.800 --> 02:53.067
I agree.
I just don't think

02:53.133 --> 02:54.300
we should be bigoted
against someone

02:54.367 --> 02:55.867
just because they have
big jugs.

02:55.933 --> 02:57.433
Okay, Mandela.
Hey.

02:57.500 --> 02:59.233
- Rob: Hi.
- Hi. Thank you.

02:59.300 --> 03:01.200
There you go.

03:02.333 --> 03:04.100
- Hey.
- Sharon: Hey.

03:04.167 --> 03:05.400
Who's that?

03:05.467 --> 03:08.033
Huh? Oh that's cross-eyed
Christian fitness mum.

03:08.100 --> 03:10.633
Don't worry. You'll get
to know them all soon.

03:10.700 --> 03:12.767
[sigh]

03:14.100 --> 03:15.167
Do you like that wine?

03:15.233 --> 03:17.400
Yeah. It's lovely.

03:17.467 --> 03:19.667
It's a Sauvignon Blanc,
but not as you know it.

03:19.733 --> 03:21.033
It's, uh, 2013.

03:21.100 --> 03:22.900
It's proper nice wine,
that.

03:22.967 --> 03:24.433
Right. I mean,

03:24.500 --> 03:25.967
you can tell me how much
it cost if you like.

03:26.033 --> 03:27.900
- 18.50.
- You're very generous.

03:27.967 --> 03:30.500
Thanks. And you're
a sneery arsehole.

03:30.567 --> 03:33.467
So your folks are
already back in Ireland?

03:33.533 --> 03:35.667
Yeah. They didn't settle
here, to be honest.

03:35.733 --> 03:38.800
Ah. I mean, they gave it
a good... half an hour.

03:38.867 --> 03:40.133
I don't think he'd admit it,

03:40.200 --> 03:41.767
but I think the area
was just too black for Dad.

03:41.833 --> 03:43.867
I mean not like
"Get off my lawn,"

03:43.933 --> 03:45.400
but he'd roll up
his car window

03:45.467 --> 03:46.933
any time a gentleman
of color walked by.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.100
Or a black guy.

03:48.167 --> 03:49.467
Or anyone in a burka.

03:49.533 --> 03:50.900
Turban?

03:50.967 --> 03:53.200
Nah. Doesn't really
mind those lads.

03:54.467 --> 03:57.300
So we wanted to see youse
because we have some news.

03:57.367 --> 03:58.733
We're moving to Spain.

03:58.800 --> 04:00.900
What? Why?

04:00.967 --> 04:03.367
Well, Mallandra
wants to spend some
time with her parents,

04:03.433 --> 04:05.733
and-- I mean,
they're super old.

04:05.800 --> 04:06.967
What age is your mum?

04:07.033 --> 04:08.000
66.

04:08.067 --> 04:09.600
- 66?
- Mm-hmm.

04:09.667 --> 04:11.833
Jesus, I thought--
thought it was--

04:11.900 --> 04:14.033
Anyway--

04:14.100 --> 04:15.567
Anyway, it's give
and take, isn't it?

04:15.633 --> 04:17.167
Wait,
she's really only 66?

04:17.233 --> 04:20.167
- Mm-hmm.
- [Fergal exhales]

04:21.200 --> 04:23.267
What are you gonna do there?

04:23.333 --> 04:25.267
Hmm? Oh, I can
make money anywhere.

04:25.333 --> 04:27.167
- I just need a laptop.
- [laugh]

04:27.233 --> 04:29.000
That'll be your new life now,

04:29.067 --> 04:31.133
trying to get online
with a modem.

04:31.200 --> 04:35.667
Er-- er-- bi bop, bi bop
bop bop, shlong, er...

04:35.733 --> 04:36.967
And what the fuck is that?

04:37.033 --> 04:38.200
Spanish internet.

04:38.267 --> 04:39.567
We have WiFi in Spain.

04:39.633 --> 04:41.167
[laugh] No, you don't.

04:41.233 --> 04:43.267
Anyway, it's gonna be
sunny and brilliant.

04:43.333 --> 04:44.967
The house we've got there,
or nearly got there--

04:45.033 --> 04:46.067
you should see the place.

04:46.133 --> 04:47.733
It's like a Spanish palace.

04:47.800 --> 04:49.133
This house is nice,

04:49.200 --> 04:51.400
but you wouldn't take a shit
in it if it was in Spain.

04:56.500 --> 04:58.633
What did you think
about all that?

04:58.700 --> 05:00.500
I think, Good for him,

05:00.567 --> 05:02.133
and I'll see him
in three months

05:02.200 --> 05:03.133
when they move back here.

05:03.200 --> 05:04.800
Mm, I feel a bit jealous.

05:04.867 --> 05:06.500
Why? You'd hate
living in Spain.

05:06.567 --> 05:08.500
You know there's more
British people there

05:08.567 --> 05:09.400
than there are here,

05:09.467 --> 05:11.067
and P.S.,
they all voted leave.

05:11.133 --> 05:12.333
You're talking
about the Costa Del Sol?

05:12.400 --> 05:14.833
They're not moving to shitty
British people Spain,

05:14.900 --> 05:18.167
they're moving to real Spanish
people Spain, which is lovely.

05:18.233 --> 05:20.267
Well, neither of us
could get work.

05:20.333 --> 05:21.900
I don't think you can
learn a new language

05:21.967 --> 05:23.200
once you're over 40.

05:23.267 --> 05:24.533
We'd starve to death.

05:24.600 --> 05:25.700
[chuckle]

05:25.767 --> 05:30.033
Aw. Shall I put Frankie
back into his own bed?

05:30.100 --> 05:32.067
I like hearing
his little snores.

05:32.133 --> 05:35.500
Oh. I was just, uh...

05:37.400 --> 05:40.333
I was just thinking that maybe
we should have some sex.

05:40.400 --> 05:42.333
God damn it.

05:42.400 --> 05:44.267
What?

05:44.333 --> 05:46.900
I just jerked off.

05:46.967 --> 05:48.300
What?

05:48.367 --> 05:49.267
Why?

05:49.333 --> 05:51.300
Well, you and I
haven't really been--

05:51.367 --> 05:52.567
Where?

05:52.633 --> 05:53.833
In the basement.

05:53.900 --> 05:56.000
In the basement.

05:56.067 --> 05:58.333
Oh, well,
that makes me feel shit.

06:00.067 --> 06:02.833
You know everyone
noticed at dinner.

06:02.900 --> 06:04.300
Noticed what?

06:04.367 --> 06:06.167
Noticed that we're not
getting on the same.

06:06.233 --> 06:07.567
They didn't notice.

06:07.633 --> 06:09.367
Well, Mallandra
asked me what was wrong.

06:09.433 --> 06:11.633
- Did you tell her?
- Tell her what?

06:11.700 --> 06:13.367
That you fondled
a student penis.

06:13.433 --> 06:15.100
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah.

06:15.167 --> 06:16.833
When are you gonna start
liking me again?

06:16.900 --> 06:18.033
I like you.

06:18.100 --> 06:19.367
Well, you're acting
like you don't.

06:19.433 --> 06:20.733
- You're acting like--
- Honey, your response

06:20.800 --> 06:23.033
when I told you I flirted
with someone at work--

06:23.100 --> 06:24.633
- Come on.
- ...was to--

06:24.700 --> 06:25.767
It wasn't about the--

06:25.833 --> 06:27.200
...was to kick me
out of my home.

06:27.267 --> 06:29.567
Okay? You had
the female response,

06:29.633 --> 06:30.933
which was to go nuclear

06:31.000 --> 06:32.233
and try to destroy
our family.

06:32.300 --> 06:34.733
I'm having
the masculine response,

06:34.800 --> 06:36.567
which is to bury the pain

06:36.633 --> 06:39.033
and jerk off in the basement
rather than touch you.

06:42.133 --> 06:44.133
Can't keep saying sorry.

06:44.200 --> 06:46.800
If I could cut off
the hand that did the--

06:46.867 --> 06:48.667
you know, I would.

06:48.733 --> 06:50.467
Well, I would endorse that

06:50.533 --> 06:53.167
if you having fewer hands
wouldn't fuck up my life

06:53.233 --> 06:54.700
and make it more difficult.

06:58.433 --> 07:00.167
The ancient Egyptians
made medicines

07:00.233 --> 07:02.300
- [knocking]
- out of extraordinary things--

07:02.367 --> 07:04.733
castor oil--
Okay, back in a second.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
What's up?

07:08.067 --> 07:10.500
Mr. Humphries died
yesterday.

07:10.567 --> 07:11.533
What?

07:11.600 --> 07:12.833
Just found out.

07:12.900 --> 07:14.667
Sharon: No way.

07:14.733 --> 07:17.033
Ah, no. Poor fucker.

07:17.100 --> 07:18.667
- Yep.
- Ohh.

07:18.733 --> 07:19.667
What was it?

07:20.967 --> 07:22.900
No. What?

07:22.967 --> 07:24.667
Oh, my God.

07:27.200 --> 07:29.933
You know, he asked me out
one time for coffee

07:30.000 --> 07:31.533
when I first started here.

07:31.600 --> 07:33.400
I said no.

07:33.467 --> 07:35.267
I don't think
that's why he did it.

07:35.333 --> 07:36.933
No, of course not.
I wasn't saying the--

07:37.000 --> 07:38.233
Because he was gay?

07:38.300 --> 07:40.567
Oh, right.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:40.633 --> 07:42.367
Yeah, I know that.

07:47.867 --> 07:49.067
You ready to boogie?

07:49.133 --> 07:51.567
Yep. Let's do this.

07:53.633 --> 07:55.200
So how did you get here?

07:55.267 --> 07:57.767
Did you take a, uh...

07:57.833 --> 08:00.200
uh-- uh, rectangle--
you know--

08:00.267 --> 08:03.633
not a carriage but the newer--
red, you know,

08:03.700 --> 08:05.667
the thing that we do now
to travel and you pay?

08:05.733 --> 08:07.600
- A bus?
- Yeah.

08:07.667 --> 08:10.167
Yeah, they said that's
gonna happen for a while.

08:10.233 --> 08:12.367
Oh, wow. So what's
this place like?

08:12.433 --> 08:13.900
Yeah, you know,
it's your average

08:13.967 --> 08:16.733
inpatient chemical
dependency unit for men.

08:16.800 --> 08:18.133
How are you?

08:18.200 --> 08:19.667
I've been better.

08:19.733 --> 08:21.667
Um, I found out, when we were
taking our little break,

08:21.733 --> 08:24.533
Sharon managed
to jerk off a young boy.

08:24.600 --> 08:26.067
- No.
- Yeah.

08:26.133 --> 08:28.333
He's 22, 23 max.

08:28.400 --> 08:29.800
[laugh]
Dude, that's terrible.

08:29.867 --> 08:30.967
Yeah, it is.

08:31.033 --> 08:32.200
Uh, and I still
don't have a job.

08:32.267 --> 08:33.800
I've had some interviews,

08:33.867 --> 08:35.467
but actually
I was gonna ask you

08:35.533 --> 08:36.967
if you had any contacts
you could hook me up with.

08:37.033 --> 08:39.000
Sure. Sure. I-- I could--

08:40.900 --> 08:42.333
Hm.

08:44.500 --> 08:45.800
What?

08:45.867 --> 08:47.967
What?

08:48.033 --> 08:49.800
Oh, fuck, man.

08:49.867 --> 08:52.233
[laugh] I mean, there is
nothing happening up here.

08:52.300 --> 08:54.033
I don't know
what I was gonna say.

08:54.100 --> 08:55.133
Okay.

08:55.200 --> 08:56.633
Don't worry.
It's gonna get better.

08:56.700 --> 08:58.700
Just because I was dead
for a little while.

09:00.700 --> 09:02.967
Ah, imagine how hard

09:03.033 --> 09:05.933
a 22-year-old boner
must feel.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.100
Terrible news
about Mr. Humphries.

09:08.167 --> 09:09.933
Uh, my God, it's terrible.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.167
It's-- I wonder if he--

09:12.233 --> 09:14.100
He was very troubled,
as you know.

09:14.167 --> 09:16.000
- Yeah, but he always seemed--
- Bipolar:

09:16.067 --> 09:17.100
the silent killer.

09:17.167 --> 09:18.433
Except when he was manic,

09:18.500 --> 09:19.867
then he would make
quite the racket.

09:19.933 --> 09:21.900
[laugh] Well, yeah, but I
don't think you can say--

09:21.967 --> 09:24.700
At any rate, we're keen
to find someone,

09:24.767 --> 09:25.900
temporarily at least,

09:25.967 --> 09:27.733
to take the role
of Head of Upper Juniors.

09:27.800 --> 09:28.833
Right.

09:28.900 --> 09:30.467
Just while we find out
where we are.

09:30.533 --> 09:31.933
Right, right.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.167
Oh, me?

09:33.233 --> 09:35.067
- Yes.
- Oh. [chuckle]

09:35.133 --> 09:36.700
Um, okay. Right, uh...

09:36.767 --> 09:38.200
- Yes?
- Um...

09:38.267 --> 09:39.833
You'd need time
to think it through?

09:39.900 --> 09:42.033
Is it gonna be more money?

09:42.100 --> 09:43.500
Yes. There's not a big
difference, but--

09:43.567 --> 09:45.067
It would be an honor.

09:50.967 --> 09:52.767
Are you Frankie's dad?

09:52.833 --> 09:54.067
Uh, yeah.

09:54.133 --> 09:55.500
I was expecting
to speak to--

09:55.567 --> 09:57.700
Doesn't your Irish
wife usually pick up?

09:57.767 --> 09:59.000
She's my only wife.

09:59.067 --> 10:00.867
I'm Wolf's mum Polly.

10:00.933 --> 10:02.433
- Woof?
- Wolf.

10:02.500 --> 10:04.433
- Okay.
- Just very quickly

10:04.500 --> 10:06.333
because I have
to pick my mother up
from Liverpool Street

10:06.400 --> 10:08.033
and take her to her
hair appointment.

10:08.100 --> 10:09.300
- Right.
- And it's a bit embarrassing,

10:09.367 --> 10:10.600
but very quickly,

10:10.667 --> 10:13.600
I'm afraid your Frankie
bit my Wolf on Friday.

10:13.667 --> 10:15.333
Really? Frankie?

10:15.400 --> 10:18.100
Yes.
Bit him twice on his arm.

10:18.167 --> 10:19.200
Left a mark.

10:19.267 --> 10:21.833
I'm sorry.
Uh, which one's Wolf?

10:21.900 --> 10:23.167
Green jumper.

10:23.233 --> 10:25.433
Raaa! Raaa!

10:25.500 --> 10:26.433
Oh, wow,

10:26.500 --> 10:28.133
- he's a big fella.
- He's very gentle.

10:30.167 --> 10:31.700
Anyway, I don't want
to involve the school.

10:31.767 --> 10:34.767
No, I don't see
why that would be necessary.

10:34.833 --> 10:36.100
Well, hopefully not.

10:36.167 --> 10:38.233
Ah, there's my keys.

10:38.300 --> 10:40.833
- Wolf: Bye, Keith.
- Hello.

10:40.900 --> 10:42.867
Sharon: What the fuck?

10:42.933 --> 10:44.167
Maybe Frankie,
in self defense,

10:44.233 --> 10:45.467
as a last resort, bit him.

10:45.533 --> 10:47.767
Or, you know,
maybe he sat on Frankie,

10:47.833 --> 10:49.600
and Frankie bit him just
so he knew he was there.

10:49.667 --> 10:50.500
But you know what?

10:50.567 --> 10:52.167
She's probably
biting her own son.

10:52.233 --> 10:54.167
She got a load of attention
when her baby was massive,

10:54.233 --> 10:55.633
and now he's just
a massive 4-year-old,

10:55.700 --> 10:57.933
so it's less interesting,
so she started biting him.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.500
Ask her
for photographic proof.

10:59.567 --> 11:01.400
- You ask her.
- I don't have her number.

11:01.467 --> 11:03.100
Well, I'm not asking her.

11:03.167 --> 11:05.267
What did, uh,
say when you asked him?

11:05.333 --> 11:07.800
He said he didn't do it,
but he's a liar.

11:07.867 --> 11:09.200
Oh, come here.

11:09.267 --> 11:12.000
I got a promotion today
because somebody died.

11:12.067 --> 11:13.167
Oh, no.

11:13.233 --> 11:14.400
- But that's great.
- Yeah. [chuckle]

11:14.467 --> 11:16.267
I know.
I'm really flattered.

11:16.333 --> 11:18.067
I have to organize
the memorial for him,

11:18.133 --> 11:20.400
so that's gonna be a bit--
but, you know, still.

11:20.467 --> 11:23.067
Right on.
Uh, is it good money?

11:23.133 --> 11:25.000
Yeah, yeah. It's great
in teacher money.

11:25.067 --> 11:26.167
In real money, no, it's shit.

11:26.233 --> 11:27.633
But isn't that inspiring?

11:27.700 --> 11:30.867
I just started back, and my
career's basically on fire.

11:30.933 --> 11:32.100
Couple of years from now,

11:32.167 --> 11:34.300
I could be Secretary
of Education.

11:34.367 --> 11:36.700
- How was your interview?
- Oh, it sucked.

11:36.767 --> 11:37.933
My new thing is I sweat,

11:38.000 --> 11:40.600
like rolling cascades
of sweat down my body.

11:40.667 --> 11:42.100
Ugh. Why?

11:42.167 --> 11:44.733
Because the school run
is like a contact sport,

11:44.800 --> 11:46.000
and, you know,
they're so filthy

11:46.067 --> 11:48.400
that after I get home
I have to take a shower.

11:48.467 --> 11:49.767
And then,
after I take a shower,

11:49.833 --> 11:51.467
I sweat for at least
two and a half hours.

11:51.533 --> 11:53.133
You know that.
And, you know,

11:53.200 --> 11:54.700
I don't have a reference
from Braeband,

11:54.767 --> 11:56.033
so that's making me sweat.

11:56.100 --> 11:58.433
Well just-- just try
and relax a little bit.

11:58.500 --> 11:59.600
You know, maybe--
maybe use it

11:59.667 --> 12:01.100
as an opportunity
to make a little joke.

12:01.167 --> 12:02.467
Like make a joke
about their air conditioning:

12:02.533 --> 12:04.933
if they hire you, they could
afford air conditioning.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.333
Yeah, I'll try that.

12:06.400 --> 12:08.500
And you know what?
Fuck Braeband.

12:08.567 --> 12:10.100
Tell them you've been
a stay-at-home dad

12:10.167 --> 12:11.333
for the last three years.

12:11.400 --> 12:12.667
I'd like to see
any of them try that.

12:12.733 --> 12:13.767
You're a hero.

12:13.833 --> 12:16.000
I mean, you're not,
but they don't know that.

12:22.667 --> 12:23.933
For the last three years

12:24.000 --> 12:26.100
I've been fathering
domestically,

12:26.167 --> 12:28.767
uh, which is to say
I've been a stay-at-home dad.

12:28.833 --> 12:30.133
I'm lucky enough
to have a wife

12:30.200 --> 12:32.067
whose career
made that possible.

12:32.133 --> 12:33.867
Oh. What does your wife do?

12:33.933 --> 12:36.167
My wife?

12:36.233 --> 12:40.567
Oh, she uh... you know,
uh, you know on planes?

12:40.633 --> 12:42.367
You know the air vents?

12:42.433 --> 12:46.300
Like, the nozzles that blow
cooling air onto you?

12:46.367 --> 12:49.533
My wife did a redesign
of those and patented it

12:49.600 --> 12:52.833
and sold it to Boeing
and Airbus.

12:52.900 --> 12:55.900
And a Chinese planes company.

12:55.967 --> 12:58.067
You missed a button
on your shirt.

12:58.133 --> 13:01.500
Oh-- [chuckle]
No, I didn't. My, uh--

13:01.567 --> 13:03.533
My son tore it off
this morning.

13:03.600 --> 13:04.800
You have a safety pin?

13:04.867 --> 13:06.533
No.

13:08.567 --> 13:11.300
If you hire me,
you'll do so well,

13:11.367 --> 13:13.100
you could afford
air conditioning.

13:15.300 --> 13:17.400
Oh-- Is-- Is--
You have. Okay.

13:18.500 --> 13:20.233
I'm so hot.

13:21.300 --> 13:22.933
I was wondering
if I should get the kids

13:23.000 --> 13:24.067
to write a little thing

13:24.133 --> 13:26.333
about Mr. Humphries
for the memorial.

13:26.400 --> 13:28.233
That would be moving,
wouldn't it?

13:28.300 --> 13:29.533
I just wrote
a little something,

13:29.600 --> 13:31.133
and I just moved myself.

13:31.200 --> 13:32.433
Well,
people don't really care

13:32.500 --> 13:34.167
when someone in
the corporate world dies.

13:34.233 --> 13:35.900
I mean, I just want
to do something

13:35.967 --> 13:38.100
that isn't just,
you know, the same old--

13:38.167 --> 13:39.600
Like, I want to honor him,

13:39.667 --> 13:40.700
and I want the kids to know

13:40.767 --> 13:42.500
that it's okay to be
messed up by all this

13:42.567 --> 13:44.833
and also-- and this is
third down the list--

13:44.900 --> 13:46.300
but also let them know

13:46.367 --> 13:47.633
there's a new sheriff
in town--

13:49.000 --> 13:50.733
of Upper Juniors.

13:54.233 --> 13:56.100
That book
must be fascinating.

13:56.167 --> 13:57.900
What are you reading?

13:57.967 --> 13:59.633
Pinochet's autobiography.

13:59.700 --> 14:00.733
Christ.

14:00.800 --> 14:03.400
It's not an autobiography.
It's a biography.

14:03.467 --> 14:05.533
What would
his autobiography say?

14:05.600 --> 14:09.233
"I'm amazing. Nothing's wrong.
I'm planting flowers."

14:09.300 --> 14:11.000
[laugh] Yeah, I guess.

14:11.067 --> 14:12.333
What are you reading?

14:12.400 --> 14:14.833
I'm reading
The Sun Also Rises.

14:14.900 --> 14:16.100
It's a proper book.

14:16.167 --> 14:17.600
You've been reading
that since we met.

14:17.667 --> 14:18.967
Are you memorizing it?

14:19.033 --> 14:20.567
Because, you know,

14:20.633 --> 14:22.767
if you're gonna be
Secretary of Education,

14:22.833 --> 14:25.733
you might try reading
more than one book
every four years.

14:25.800 --> 14:27.367
Well, that's mean.

14:27.433 --> 14:30.633
Oh, by the way, I told your
air conditioning joke today,

14:30.700 --> 14:34.133
and I looked like a fucking
idiot, so thanks for that.

14:35.833 --> 14:38.533
Well, you probably
told it wrong.

14:38.600 --> 14:40.433
Dan: You don't tell
an interviewer

14:40.500 --> 14:41.967
you're a stay-at-home dad.

14:42.033 --> 14:43.267
I mean, that's fine to say

14:43.333 --> 14:45.500
at a garden party
or in Sweden,

14:45.567 --> 14:47.800
but-- but--
but not here, okay?

14:47.867 --> 14:49.767
- Okay, but, uh--
- Yeah, over here,

14:49.833 --> 14:51.333
men work in real jobs,
do you understand that?

14:51.400 --> 14:52.767
Uh, hang on a second.

14:52.833 --> 14:56.133
Uh, so I spoke to Frankie,
and he said he didn't do it,

14:56.200 --> 14:59.233
so, you know, I think
it might be a case
of, you know--

14:59.300 --> 15:01.133
That is the world that we're
trying to get you a job in.

15:01.200 --> 15:02.267
I'm sorry. I don't think
it's good enough

15:02.333 --> 15:03.400
just to say he didn't do it.

15:03.467 --> 15:04.900
Can I just
finish this call?

15:04.967 --> 15:06.833
Wolf's lost a lot
of confidence over--

15:06.900 --> 15:08.167
All right, first interviews

15:08.233 --> 15:10.200
are about "Can I work
with you? Are you a prick?"

15:10.267 --> 15:11.300
He wet the bed last night

15:11.367 --> 15:12.900
for the first time
since last week.

15:12.967 --> 15:14.567
Uh, look, I'd like
to settle this--

15:14.633 --> 15:16.367
And I'd like
for my son to be able

15:16.433 --> 15:18.500
to attend school without
fear of being disfigured.

15:18.567 --> 15:20.867
Is there a piece
of your son missing?

15:20.933 --> 15:22.967
Did my son bite a piece
of flesh out of your son?

15:23.033 --> 15:25.267
- No, but he's--
- I don't have a job
right now, okay?

15:25.333 --> 15:27.100
I am unemployed,
and as a result,

15:27.167 --> 15:28.800
my family might not
have a home soon.

15:28.867 --> 15:30.267
Okay?
So I have priorities.

15:30.333 --> 15:31.600
Well,
my son is my priority.

15:31.667 --> 15:33.600
Just tell me
what you want me to do.

15:33.667 --> 15:35.633
Do you want to bite my son?
Would that help?

15:35.700 --> 15:37.067
Do you want me to bite him?

15:37.133 --> 15:38.867
Hey, Woof.

15:38.933 --> 15:41.000
You wanna bite Frankie?

15:41.067 --> 15:43.000
Just tell me
what you want me to do.

15:44.133 --> 15:45.433
- Rob?
- What?

15:45.500 --> 15:47.267
We just got
an interview for you

15:47.333 --> 15:49.500
at Harbury Capital.
They'd like to see you
this afternoon.

15:49.567 --> 15:52.400
Wow. Really?
Well, that's great.

15:52.467 --> 15:54.700
Ha ha.
Well, that's wonderful.

15:54.767 --> 15:56.100
Did you hear that?

15:57.600 --> 16:00.567
Derek Humphries
was a beloved teacher.

16:00.633 --> 16:03.967
He loved music,
and he loved jokes.

16:04.033 --> 16:06.667
He enjoyed having fun.

16:06.733 --> 16:08.267
We all remember the time

16:08.333 --> 16:10.867
he printed permission slips
for the Easter field trip

16:10.933 --> 16:12.933
on the wrong sized paper

16:13.000 --> 16:14.733
and passed them out anyway.

16:14.800 --> 16:16.767
[student coughs]

16:16.833 --> 16:19.033
Ms. Norris and year 5

16:19.100 --> 16:22.367
have prepared a musical
tribute to his memory.

16:22.433 --> 16:25.567
Ms. Norris, I'll let you
introduce the performance.

16:25.633 --> 16:26.500
[hoarse] Hi--

16:26.567 --> 16:28.900
Oh. [cough]
Sorry, a bit nervous.

16:28.967 --> 16:31.733
[chuckle]
Hi. So, uh, yeah,

16:31.800 --> 16:32.967
so I just wanted to say

16:33.033 --> 16:35.600
that, uh, while we all
loved Mr. Humphries,

16:35.667 --> 16:37.867
I'm sure some of you
are troubled

16:37.933 --> 16:41.567
by the fact that he took
his own, uh, what he did--

16:41.633 --> 16:44.667
Uh, and I don't think
I'd be doing my job

16:44.733 --> 16:46.467
as head of upper juniors

16:46.533 --> 16:50.067
if I didn't say that if any
of you are thinking of...

16:50.133 --> 16:53.433
d-doing something, uh,
like he did,

16:53.500 --> 16:54.533
then, you know,

16:54.600 --> 16:56.100
don't. [chuckle]

16:56.167 --> 16:58.000
Uh, my door is always open.

16:58.067 --> 16:59.300
Um, I mean that.

16:59.367 --> 17:02.500
Um, it's hard--
it's hard being a kid.

17:02.567 --> 17:04.333
I know that. Um,

17:04.400 --> 17:07.067
I've had tough times
in my life

17:07.133 --> 17:12.100
from about 22 to about...
yeah, maybe 34.

17:12.167 --> 17:13.300
I-- I had tough times.

17:13.367 --> 17:14.467
I had acne in adulthood.

17:14.533 --> 17:16.400
Um, a lot of times,
people tell you

17:16.467 --> 17:18.733
you wrap all that up
in your teenage years.

17:18.800 --> 17:21.567
It's not true for everyone.

17:21.633 --> 17:23.833
So, um-- yeah,

17:23.900 --> 17:25.567
year five are gonna
perform a song,

17:25.633 --> 17:29.267
uh, we wrote about
Mr. Humphries, so up.

17:29.333 --> 17:32.033
Uh, they rehearsed very hard,

17:32.100 --> 17:36.333
so if any of you feel like,
you know, dancing or swaying,

17:36.400 --> 17:37.900
then, uh, just go right ahead.

17:37.967 --> 17:39.600
- No dancing.
- Okay.

17:40.833 --> 17:43.967
**

17:44.033 --> 17:45.400
Lets just start again

17:45.467 --> 17:48.800
because Kira, uh--
started ahead of--

17:48.867 --> 17:50.067
Okay.

17:50.133 --> 17:52.567
** [children singing
incomprehensibly]

18:03.533 --> 18:06.500
Well, I grew Fry & Loeb
from nothing

18:06.567 --> 18:09.233
to a 100-million-dollar-a-year
firm,

18:09.300 --> 18:12.033
thanks mainly to securing
a 360 deal with Jeff's Cola.

18:12.100 --> 18:13.367
Right, right.

18:13.433 --> 18:15.233
You know, I haven't been
in the field for a while,

18:15.300 --> 18:18.000
but I've got a thick-ass
book of contacts--

18:18.067 --> 18:21.000
Niromax, P&G, Glaxo, Elron.

18:21.067 --> 18:22.100
Right.

18:22.167 --> 18:23.500
Pharmaceutical firms.

18:23.567 --> 18:25.733
Is that from your time
at Braeband?

18:25.800 --> 18:28.800
Uh, well--

18:28.867 --> 18:31.233
Didn't you do a stint
at Braeband?

18:31.300 --> 18:33.633
Yeah, but it's not
on my CV, so how--

18:33.700 --> 18:35.100
Suzy, my assistant,
used to work there.

18:35.167 --> 18:36.267
She recognized your name.

18:36.333 --> 18:38.133
Shady place, though.

18:38.200 --> 18:40.033
I've known other folk
to leave it off their CV.

18:40.100 --> 18:41.367
Well, the reason for that--

18:41.433 --> 18:43.100
It doesn't really matter.

18:43.167 --> 18:45.267
What is concerning me
right now

18:45.333 --> 18:47.200
is that you smell of alcohol.

18:49.300 --> 18:53.000
I met a friend for lunch,
and I had a beer.

18:53.067 --> 18:54.000
- But--
- You had a beer?

18:54.067 --> 18:55.367
A beer?

18:55.433 --> 18:56.600
Mate, if you had a beer,

18:56.667 --> 18:58.133
then I had lunch
with Princess Diana.

18:58.200 --> 18:59.133
You had lunch with who?

18:59.200 --> 19:00.200
Princess Diana.

19:00.267 --> 19:01.967
I'm sorry. It's--

19:02.033 --> 19:03.800
It's just very difficult
to understand you.

19:03.867 --> 19:04.867
You don't
have to understand me

19:04.933 --> 19:06.033
because you won't
be working here.

19:06.100 --> 19:08.100
Well, good, because
I don't want to work

19:08.167 --> 19:09.533
at your Scottish
whistle factory.

19:09.600 --> 19:11.467
- I'm Welsh, you idiot.
- Woo hoo!

19:11.533 --> 19:14.733
News flash. I know.
I said that to upset you.

19:14.800 --> 19:16.400
What is upsetting me
is you're still sitting here.

19:16.467 --> 19:19.633
Well, get ready to be excited
because I'm leaving.

19:19.700 --> 19:21.567
Well, you should take a good
long look at yourself mate.

19:21.633 --> 19:24.400
You should take
a long listen to yourself,

19:24.467 --> 19:26.200
and I think you'd like
what you hear

19:26.267 --> 19:28.100
because your accent
is adorable.

19:28.167 --> 19:30.067
- I've gotta go.
- Well, don't let me stop you.

19:30.133 --> 19:32.600
I shant.
You're a cutie pie.

19:32.667 --> 19:34.233
Have a fantastic day.

19:40.067 --> 19:41.433
I don't know
why it sounded like that.

19:41.500 --> 19:44.167
I think, you know,
Kira started out of time,

19:44.233 --> 19:45.600
and then the rest followed her

19:45.667 --> 19:47.667
because she's so,
you know, developed--

19:47.733 --> 19:49.333
I mean, uh, tall.

19:49.400 --> 19:51.233
Thank you for the performance
Ms. Norris,

19:51.300 --> 19:53.633
although I didn't see
why you needed to mention
that he was gay.

19:56.100 --> 19:57.900
I'm not gonna
whitewash history.

19:57.967 --> 19:59.933
I think referencing
a teacher's sexuality,

20:00.000 --> 20:01.167
gay or straight,

20:01.233 --> 20:02.867
is inappropriate
for primary level.

20:02.933 --> 20:04.133
Really?

20:04.200 --> 20:05.900
Well, why don't you do
the next memorial, then?

20:05.967 --> 20:06.900
I'd be happy to.

20:06.967 --> 20:08.033
Great, great.

20:08.100 --> 20:09.567
Well, I hope
you don't do my memorial

20:09.633 --> 20:11.767
because I'm not ashamed
of my sexuality

20:11.833 --> 20:13.533
and I'd
want it all out there.

20:16.933 --> 20:18.567
No talking!

20:18.633 --> 20:20.333
How long do you think
it would take you

20:20.400 --> 20:22.367
to get a head teacher job?

20:22.433 --> 20:24.567
I'm never gonna get
a head teacher job.

20:24.633 --> 20:26.500
You should have seen
my assembly today.

20:26.567 --> 20:28.100
It was a car crash.

20:28.167 --> 20:29.567
Did anyone film it?

20:29.633 --> 20:31.200
What?

20:31.267 --> 20:33.767
Jesus, I fucking hope not.

20:41.700 --> 20:43.200
Hey.

20:43.267 --> 20:45.767
How would you feel about
putting the house on the market

20:45.833 --> 20:47.267
and getting a smaller place?

20:48.800 --> 20:51.967
Oh. Um... well--

20:52.033 --> 20:56.233
I mean, why have the pressure
of this monster mortgage?

20:56.300 --> 20:59.267
Yeah, but you're gonna
get something, right?

20:59.333 --> 21:00.600
And there's always Braeband.

21:00.667 --> 21:02.333
I mean, you can always--
I mean, Harita--

21:02.400 --> 21:04.733
Honey, I don't want
to work for those kind
of people anymore.

21:04.800 --> 21:05.833
It's too stressful.

21:05.900 --> 21:07.467
I want to be alive
in 20 years.

21:07.533 --> 21:09.167
I want to meet
our grandchildren.

21:09.233 --> 21:10.367
Yeah, we all want that,

21:10.433 --> 21:12.133
but you've gotta
strike a balance.

21:12.200 --> 21:14.333
Of course I don't want you
to die too young,

21:14.400 --> 21:15.667
but you can't have
a stress-free job

21:15.733 --> 21:17.133
because who the fuck
are you?

21:17.200 --> 21:18.733
Why should your job
be a picnic?

21:18.800 --> 21:20.900
Kids in China are in mines.

21:20.967 --> 21:23.000
I don't care
about Chinese people.

21:23.067 --> 21:24.300
[laugh]

21:27.367 --> 21:28.633
Are you really worrying?

21:28.700 --> 21:30.000
I'm fine.

21:30.067 --> 21:31.600
Because we've got a lot
to be grateful for.

21:31.667 --> 21:33.867
You know?
You should remember that.

21:33.933 --> 21:35.367
We've got our health.

21:37.167 --> 21:38.367
You say something now.

21:38.433 --> 21:42.000
We have a beautiful,
curious, amazing daughter

21:42.067 --> 21:43.600
and Frankie.

21:44.800 --> 21:45.800
Yeah, we got good teeth.

21:47.867 --> 21:50.100
We have a restaurant quality
blender.

21:50.167 --> 21:51.333
Hey, we can sell that.

21:53.067 --> 21:54.733
You like me again?

21:54.800 --> 21:59.367
I'm trying not to,
but it's not going very well.

22:01.200 --> 22:04.300
I'm sorry your assembly
was a car crash.

22:06.167 --> 22:07.167
It's okay.

22:07.233 --> 22:09.167
I don't even really--

22:09.233 --> 22:11.233
I just wanted
to make you proud of me.

22:11.300 --> 22:13.400
Just make you forget
all the other shit.

22:21.533 --> 22:22.900
I really want
to keep hugging you,

22:22.967 --> 22:24.233
but you just-- Jesus,

22:24.300 --> 22:26.000
you really stink
of cheese & onion crisps.

22:26.067 --> 22:28.800
Do you make them now
with your body?

22:28.867 --> 22:30.333
Fuck, it's overpowering.

- Shh!

22:40.467 --> 22:42.933

- Please stop it.

- What?

23:05.800 --> 23:07.000
No, no. I wasn't-- I'm not--

23:07.067 --> 23:08.933
I'm sure
Frankie didn't do it.

23:09.000 --> 23:10.100
I mean, look at him.

23:10.167 --> 23:11.567
He's a savage.

23:11.633 --> 23:12.967
I hate him.

23:13.033 --> 23:15.100
Oh, God, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

23:15.167 --> 23:17.700
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I shouted at you.

23:17.767 --> 23:19.333
I'm sure Wolf's a great kid.

23:19.400 --> 23:21.833
I mean, yeah, he lied
about Frankie, but so what?

23:21.900 --> 23:23.233
I mean, we're all
just doing our best.

23:23.300 --> 23:25.900
I mean, look at me.
I'm a mess.

23:25.967 --> 23:27.300
I can't provide for my family.

23:27.367 --> 23:29.400
I have diarrhea every day.

23:29.467 --> 23:33.367
You know, I have secrets
inside of me that-- Ow!

Son of a-- [chuckle]

23:35.667 --> 23:40.000
It's crazy that he did that
for you to see.

23:40.067 --> 23:41.900
I swear to God.

23:41.967 --> 23:43.467
Wh--

23:43.533 --> 23:45.233
He's never done that before.
