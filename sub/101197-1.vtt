and pick up some toilet

03:41.096 --> 03:44.349

03:41.096 --> 03:44.349
my cup of Kool-Aid.

03:49.104 --> 03:52.440
- My family and I are

03:49.104 --> 03:52.440
examples of mindful living.

03:52.482 --> 03:54.275
I've made myself perfectly

03:52.482 --> 03:54.275
clear on this issue

03:54.317 --> 03:56.403
to our esteemed mayor.

03:56.444 --> 03:57.905
I don't see why we

03:56.444 --> 03:57.905
have to have a rodeo

03:57.946 --> 04:01.282
back in this town

03:57.946 --> 04:01.282
after all these years.

04:01.324 --> 04:04.119
Our community has long

04:01.324 --> 04:04.119
stood for high values

04:04.161 --> 04:07.039
and common decency

04:04.161 --> 04:07.039
to all creatures.

04:09.332 --> 04:10.375
Mr. Mayor.

04:12.211 --> 04:13.795
You've not

04:12.211 --> 04:13.795
represented the wishes

04:13.837 --> 04:15.714
of the people of Potter Creek

04:15.756 --> 04:18.592
by bringing this

04:15.756 --> 04:18.592
display of animal abuse

04:18.633 --> 04:19.843
to our town.

04:19.885 --> 04:22.637
(applauding)

04:28.435 --> 04:29.770
- Are you gonna let me speak

04:29.811 --> 04:31.312
or is this the Robert show?

04:31.354 --> 04:32.522
- I feel like you have spoken

04:32.564 --> 04:34.816
by making this decision without

04:34.858 --> 04:36.484
consulting any of

04:34.858 --> 04:36.484
the council members.

04:36.526 --> 04:40.655
- I talked to Carl and he

04:36.526 --> 04:40.655
thought it was good idea.

04:42.116 --> 04:44.367
- I'm calling for a complete

04:42.116 --> 04:44.367
boycott of this event.

04:44.409 --> 04:45.911
Spread the word to your friends

04:45.953 --> 04:47.913
that people still run this town

04:47.955 --> 04:51.208
even if our elected official

04:47.955 --> 04:51.208
refuses to acknowledge that.

04:51.250 --> 04:53.585
(applauding)

04:59.925 --> 05:00.884
- Good job in there babe.

05:00.926 --> 05:02.844
- Thank you sweetheart.

05:02.886 --> 05:04.721
- [Luke] Eddie and Carl

05:02.886 --> 05:04.721
are still gonna go.

05:04.763 --> 05:06.556
- Hey, can I go to the

05:04.763 --> 05:06.556
diner with Britney?

05:06.598 --> 05:08.892
- Tracy, don't

05:06.598 --> 05:08.892
you have something

05:08.934 --> 05:09.935
to say to your dad?

05:09.977 --> 05:11.394
(clearing throat)

05:11.436 --> 05:13.396
- You killed in

05:11.436 --> 05:13.396
there Mr. Councilman.

05:13.438 --> 05:14.731
- Thank you.

05:14.773 --> 05:17.276
- Can I please go

05:14.773 --> 05:17.276
to the diner now?

05:17.317 --> 05:18.777
- I could really use your help

05:18.819 --> 05:20.320
setting up for the

05:18.819 --> 05:20.320
farmer's market tomorrow.

05:20.361 --> 05:22.114
- Luke can do it.

05:20.361 --> 05:22.114
- Hey.

05:22.156 --> 05:24.324
- I can use both of your help.

05:25.951 --> 05:30.455
- We have enough volunteers

05:25.951 --> 05:30.455
for two farmers' markets.

05:30.497 --> 05:31.331
Go ahead.

05:31.372 --> 05:32.624
- Thanks Mom.

05:37.004 --> 05:38.421
- Yes.

05:37.004 --> 05:38.421
- Let's do it.

05:38.463 --> 05:39.965
- Okay, we're gonna

05:38.463 --> 05:39.965
go to the diner

05:40.007 --> 05:42.217
because their fries are so good.

05:43.051 --> 05:44.303
Are you coming?

05:47.973 --> 05:50.433
Hello, space to Tracy.

05:50.475 --> 05:53.020
(laughing)

05:53.061 --> 05:54.521
Oh, my God Trace.

05:54.562 --> 05:56.355
Your dad is such a buzzkill.

05:56.397 --> 05:57.565
- I know.

05:57.607 --> 05:59.901
I cannot wait to get to college.

05:59.943 --> 06:02.403
- Do you know my parents

05:59.943 --> 06:02.403
want to drive me?

06:02.445 --> 06:05.157
Like can you imagine

06:02.445 --> 06:05.157
Ernie talking

06:05.199 --> 06:07.408
to my dorm mates,

06:05.199 --> 06:07.408
like oh my gosh,

06:07.450 --> 06:09.119
I used to go here like

06:07.450 --> 06:09.119
a hundred years ago.

06:09.161 --> 06:10.369
- No.

06:10.411 --> 06:12.247
- That's so embarrassing.

06:12.289 --> 06:14.166
- Well, Dylan wants to drive me.

06:14.208 --> 06:15.667
- Of course he does.

06:15.709 --> 06:17.752
Because he wants to piss

06:15.709 --> 06:17.752
all over your territory

06:17.794 --> 06:19.420
so none of the college

06:17.794 --> 06:19.420
boys hit on you.

06:19.462 --> 06:21.006
- That is not why.

06:22.841 --> 06:24.425
Oh, my God, that's totally why.

06:24.467 --> 06:25.927
- Totally why.

06:25.969 --> 06:28.930
Ugh, why don't you

06:25.969 --> 06:28.930
break up with him?

06:28.972 --> 06:30.807
- We're gonna be like

06:28.972 --> 06:30.807
a thousand miles apart.

06:30.849 --> 06:32.559
That's kind of like

06:30.849 --> 06:32.559
a breakup, right.

06:32.600 --> 06:34.353
- No, that's kinda lame.

06:34.393 --> 06:35.603
- Shut up.

06:35.645 --> 06:37.731
(laughing)

06:37.772 --> 06:39.691
- [Britney] Look Trace.

06:39.733 --> 06:41.193
It's the rodeo.

06:41.235 --> 06:42.194
- Oh, yeah.

06:43.945 --> 06:45.113
Where are you taking me?

06:45.155 --> 06:46.405
- [Britney] Duh,

06:45.155 --> 06:46.405
I want to see what

06:46.447 --> 06:47.657
all the fuss is about.

06:47.699 --> 06:49.284
- [Tracy] Britney!

06:47.699 --> 06:49.284
- [Britney] What?

06:49.326 --> 06:51.286
- [Tracy] What are we gonna do?

06:49.326 --> 06:51.286
- You're gonna live a little.

06:51.328 --> 06:54.998
(playful music)

06:55.040 --> 06:56.750
Come on.

06:56.791 --> 06:58.085
Come on, come on.

06:59.669 --> 07:02.797
Aw, they're like 20

06:59.669 --> 07:02.797
sweaters waitin' to happen.

07:02.839 --> 07:04.799
- This is the big bad rodeo.

07:04.841 --> 07:06.551
- Or maybe it's the petting zoo.

07:06.593 --> 07:08.803
- Wait, what are you doing?

07:08.845 --> 07:10.764
- I'm gonna catch

07:08.845 --> 07:10.764
one of these broncos.

07:10.805 --> 07:12.099
- Britney!

07:21.358 --> 07:24.194

07:25.153 --> 07:26.529
- Switch!

07:25.153 --> 07:26.529

07:26.571 --> 07:27.948

Get in here.

07:27.989 --> 07:29.783

I'm not here to hang

08:31.261 --> 08:33.888
- Fries, milkshake, got it.

08:33.930 --> 08:36.099
- And I'll have a cheeseburger.

08:36.141 --> 08:37.392
- No way.

08:37.434 --> 08:39.060
- Are you serious?

08:39.102 --> 08:41.980
- Okay, vegetarian

08:39.102 --> 08:41.980
girl gone wild.

08:42.022 --> 08:44.399
- What, I can order a

08:42.022 --> 08:44.399
cheeseburger if I want to.

08:44.441 --> 08:46.067
- So a burger?

08:46.109 --> 08:47.694
- Yes.

08:47.735 --> 08:48.862
- Okay, darlin'.

08:50.571 --> 08:52.782
(gentle music)

08:57.912 --> 08:59.164
- Your mom thought

08:57.912 --> 08:59.164
Luke would have

08:59.206 --> 09:01.916
more fun with you ladies.

09:01.958 --> 09:03.877
- Sure thing, Mr. Peterson.

09:05.586 --> 09:09.299
- Okay, well then I'll just

09:05.586 --> 09:09.299
leave him here with you then.

09:09.799 --> 09:11.259
Uh.

09:15.805 --> 09:16.931
For, uh.

09:16.973 --> 09:18.016
- Thanks Dad.

09:23.813 --> 09:24.772
- Will you save my spot,

09:24.814 --> 09:25.690
I gotta use the restroom.

09:25.732 --> 09:27.108
- Yeah.

09:27.150 --> 09:28.776
- Well, you better

09:27.150 --> 09:28.776
enjoy that burger.

09:28.818 --> 09:31.530
It's gonna be

09:28.818 --> 09:31.530
your last meal.

09:28.818 --> 09:31.530
(laughing)

09:51.799 --> 09:53.134
(door banging)

09:53.176 --> 09:54.302
- Ah, dang it.

09:55.345 --> 09:57.389
- Man, are you kiddin' me?

09:58.306 --> 09:59.682
Hey!

09:59.724 --> 10:01.935
Watch it pal, it's

09:59.724 --> 10:01.935
a brand-new truck.

10:01.976 --> 10:05.021
- Aw, I'm sorry,

10:01.976 --> 10:05.021
is this your car?

10:05.063 --> 10:06.981
- It's a truck pal.

10:07.023 --> 10:08.316
And yeah, it's mine.

10:08.358 --> 10:10.860
- Well, I think it looks okay.

10:12.362 --> 10:16.616
- I don't think you

10:12.362 --> 10:16.616
can tell in this light.

10:16.657 --> 10:18.493
- Uh, wanna take

10:16.657 --> 10:18.493
a look yourself.

10:18.535 --> 10:20.954
- Just said you can't tell here.

10:20.995 --> 10:22.747
What's your problem, man?

10:22.789 --> 10:25.459
- Ooh, I don't

10:22.789 --> 10:25.459
have a problem.

10:22.789 --> 10:25.459
You know what?

10:25.500 --> 10:27.127
I'll be in Potter Creek

10:25.500 --> 10:27.127
all week with the rodeo.

10:27.168 --> 10:29.337
If you see any

10:27.168 --> 10:29.337
damage of any kind,

10:29.379 --> 10:31.214
you can bring it by there

10:29.379 --> 10:31.214
and I'll take care of it.

10:31.256 --> 10:34.217
- So I'm supposed

10:31.256 --> 10:34.217
to just trust you?

10:35.635 --> 10:39.013
- I don't know. Do you

10:35.635 --> 10:39.013
have any other ideas?

10:40.807 --> 10:41.933
- I'll find you.

10:43.435 --> 10:44.936
- Won't be hidin'.

11:05.957 --> 11:06.958
Howdy y'all.

11:13.047 --> 11:14.090
- That's him.

11:14.132 --> 11:15.049
- [Britney] He's cute.

11:15.091 --> 11:15.883
- I know.

11:15.925 --> 11:16.801
- Scooch.

11:16.843 --> 11:17.969
- Luke, please stop.

11:18.011 --> 11:19.554
- Oh, come on,

11:18.011 --> 11:19.554
just scoot over.

11:19.596 --> 11:21.598
- No, find somewhere

11:19.596 --> 11:21.598
else to sit.

11:21.640 --> 11:22.681
- Man.

11:24.851 --> 11:25.810
- [Britney] Too much.

11:25.852 --> 11:27.020
- I'm not mean.

11:30.190 --> 11:31.608
- [Jenna] Sorry,

11:30.190 --> 11:31.608
Luke, I need the booth

11:31.650 --> 11:32.984
for a group of six.

11:33.026 --> 11:34.235
- Oh, man.

11:37.113 --> 11:37.905
- Hey, buddy?

11:37.947 --> 11:39.449
You need a seat?

11:39.491 --> 11:40.992
- Nah, I'm fine.

11:41.034 --> 11:42.661
- No, hold on.

11:42.701 --> 11:43.702
Um...

11:45.038 --> 11:48.166
Hey, guys, are you saving

11:45.038 --> 11:48.166
that seat for anyone?

11:48.208 --> 11:49.959
Kid needs a place to sit.

11:51.127 --> 11:52.420
- Sure whatever.

11:52.462 --> 11:53.712
- Thank you.

11:56.591 --> 11:57.967
Here's the thing, he's with me

11:58.009 --> 12:02.263
so if you guys could

11:58.009 --> 12:02.263
just slide down,

12:02.305 --> 12:03.973
that'd be great, thank you.

12:04.015 --> 12:06.601
- Let's get outta here.

12:06.643 --> 12:07.935
Dumb hick.

12:10.813 --> 12:11.856
- Now we have three seats.

12:11.898 --> 12:12.940
Come on.

12:14.108 --> 12:15.860
- Thanks.

12:14.108 --> 12:15.860
- No problem.

12:15.902 --> 12:17.612
- Thought that guy

12:15.902 --> 12:17.612
was gonna punch you.

12:17.654 --> 12:20.031
- Aw, he just needed a

12:17.654 --> 12:20.031
little love, that's all.

12:20.073 --> 12:23.159
Hey, isn't that your

12:20.073 --> 12:23.159
sister over there?

12:24.327 --> 12:27.706
- Yeah. They won't

12:24.327 --> 12:27.706
let me sit with them.

12:27.746 --> 12:29.957
- Sounds like a big sister.

12:31.334 --> 12:32.627
Are you hungry?

12:32.669 --> 12:34.421
- Yeah.

12:32.669 --> 12:34.421
- What are you gettin'?

12:34.462 --> 12:36.381
- I'm thinking about beef

12:34.462 --> 12:36.381
sliders or some fries.

12:36.423 --> 12:37.674
- Okay.

12:48.101 --> 12:50.604
- [Jenna] Here you go darlin'.

12:52.355 --> 12:53.273
- Dig in.

12:55.358 --> 12:56.234
- Luke.

12:57.776 --> 12:59.404
My brother and I have to go.

12:59.446 --> 13:00.614
- Wait, we just got our food.

13:00.655 --> 13:02.865
- Yeah, Luke's a vegetarian.

13:05.910 --> 13:07.954
- Could've fooled me.

13:07.995 --> 13:09.956
- You should not have

13:07.995 --> 13:09.956
bought him all that.

13:09.997 --> 13:11.916
- I'm sorry, I didn't know.

13:11.958 --> 13:14.168
- Yeah, there's a lot

13:11.958 --> 13:14.168
you don't know cowboy.

13:14.210 --> 13:17.213
This town doesn't

13:14.210 --> 13:17.213
want your rodeo here.

13:17.255 --> 13:18.715
- Yeah, I heard.

13:19.633 --> 13:21.676
I was at the meeting.

13:21.718 --> 13:24.596
- Yeah, that loud

13:21.718 --> 13:24.596
old guy was my dad.

13:24.638 --> 13:27.766
- Wait, so he's like

13:24.638 --> 13:27.766
the spiritual leader

13:24.638 --> 13:27.766
of the city or what?

13:27.806 --> 13:30.435
- Yeah, he likes to think so.

13:32.228 --> 13:35.856
Look, I'm sorry, but we

13:32.228 --> 13:35.856
really have to go, come on.

13:35.898 --> 13:36.691
- Thanks Colton.

13:36.733 --> 13:38.485
- [Tracy] Luke!

13:38.526 --> 13:39.569
- Sorry.

13:52.999 --> 13:54.041
Seriously?

13:59.130 --> 14:00.256
That's great.

14:02.883 --> 14:05.470
- Wouldn't want

14:02.883 --> 14:05.470
you to get anything

14:02.883 --> 14:05.470
on your pants or shirt.

14:05.512 --> 14:07.472
- Well, I appreciate that, sir.

14:07.514 --> 14:09.015
- Hey, hey, hey!

14:10.767 --> 14:13.812
Why the hell are you

14:10.767 --> 14:13.812
just getting back?

14:14.937 --> 14:16.606
- Oh, hey, Shawn.

14:16.648 --> 14:18.065
I just got a little

14:16.648 --> 14:18.065
turned around

14:18.107 --> 14:19.984
coming back from town.

14:21.027 --> 14:22.654
I'm sorry.

14:23.946 --> 14:25.615
- You understand that this job

14:25.657 --> 14:28.201
isn't like a job on a

14:25.657 --> 14:28.201
cruise ship, don't you, son?

14:28.242 --> 14:31.078
Where you pull into a

14:28.242 --> 14:31.078
different port every night.

14:31.120 --> 14:32.497
- It won't happen again, sir.

14:32.539 --> 14:34.915
- See that it doesn't.

14:34.957 --> 14:37.377
Well, don't just stand there--

14:34.957 --> 14:37.377
put your toilet paper away

14:37.418 --> 14:40.338
and come help me

14:37.418 --> 14:40.338
in the damn barn.

14:40.380 --> 14:42.382
- You got it sir.

14:42.423 --> 14:44.676
(laughing)

14:45.552 --> 14:48.137
Don't worry about him.

14:48.179 --> 14:51.265
He's throwing his weight

14:48.179 --> 14:51.265
around to feel important.

14:51.307 --> 14:53.100
- Yeah, well, he's

14:51.307 --> 14:53.100
more important than me.

14:53.142 --> 14:55.019
- Well, yeah, by a lot.

14:56.479 --> 14:58.272
He just told me one

14:56.479 --> 14:58.272
of the riders got hurt

14:58.314 --> 14:59.733
in PBR Premier Series.

14:59.774 --> 15:00.983
- Wait.

15:01.025 --> 15:02.610
- Hold on, show respect.

15:05.071 --> 15:06.823
- Vince, that's insane,

15:05.071 --> 15:06.823
are you kidding me.

15:06.865 --> 15:08.366
- Mm-hmm.

15:06.865 --> 15:08.366
- They called you up?

15:08.408 --> 15:10.284
- Oh, no, not yet, I

15:08.408 --> 15:10.284
just need a clean ride

15:10.326 --> 15:11.952
this weekend, I have

15:10.326 --> 15:11.952
the points to qualify.

15:11.994 --> 15:13.538
- That's amazing.

15:11.994 --> 15:13.538
- Mm-hmm.

15:13.580 --> 15:15.540
I talked to my wrangler

15:13.580 --> 15:15.540
rep about you again.

15:15.582 --> 15:17.876
Thinking about sponsoring you.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.711
Be here this weekend.

15:19.753 --> 15:21.003
- Uh, this weekend?

15:19.753 --> 15:21.003
- Mm-hmm.

15:21.045 --> 15:22.630
- The town hates the rodeo.

15:22.672 --> 15:24.131
- A few people aren't

15:22.672 --> 15:24.131
gonna stop a PPR event.

15:24.173 --> 15:26.133
- No, it's not

15:24.173 --> 15:26.133
just a few people.

15:26.175 --> 15:27.427
It's a whole town of people.

15:27.468 --> 15:28.803
Everyone wants to boycott it.

15:28.845 --> 15:30.430
- Ah, it'll be fine.

15:30.471 --> 15:33.266
So, it'll stir the pot

15:30.471 --> 15:33.266
in this town, you know.

15:33.307 --> 15:35.518
We got plenty of folks

15:33.307 --> 15:35.518
to fill our seats.

15:35.560 --> 15:38.229
- But Vince, you know--

15:35.560 --> 15:38.229
- Hey, look, I've seen

15:35.560 --> 15:38.229
this deal before man.

15:38.271 --> 15:40.648
We all have.

15:38.271 --> 15:40.648
Just focus on your rides.

15:40.690 --> 15:43.109
Be a wrangler man in no time.

15:50.157 --> 15:52.702
- Why are you just getting back?

15:50.157 --> 15:52.702
- Hank, you scared me.

15:52.744 --> 15:55.288
- Everything okay, dude?

15:52.744 --> 15:55.288
- Yeah, I guess so.

15:55.329 --> 15:57.791
- Yeah, so why'd it

15:55.329 --> 15:57.791
take you four hours

15:55.329 --> 15:57.791
to go get toilet paper?

15:57.832 --> 16:00.501
- Some local idiot let the hours

15:57.832 --> 16:00.501
out of one of my tires.

16:00.543 --> 16:01.419
- Was he bigger than you?

16:01.461 --> 16:02.462
- Not really.

16:02.503 --> 16:03.922
- So he's dead now?

16:03.963 --> 16:05.882
- No, Hank, I didn't

16:03.963 --> 16:05.882
see him do it.

16:05.924 --> 16:07.007
- Aw.

16:07.049 --> 16:08.384
Come on man.

16:08.426 --> 16:09.803
You're terrible at making

16:08.426 --> 16:09.803
friends, you know that.

16:09.844 --> 16:11.512
- Hey, would you help me

16:09.844 --> 16:11.512
with some of this stuff?

16:11.554 --> 16:13.431
- I will.

16:13.473 --> 16:15.683
I will help you carry

16:13.473 --> 16:15.683
one roll of toilet paper.

16:13.473 --> 16:15.683
- Hank.

16:15.725 --> 16:17.977
- I'll go install

16:15.725 --> 16:17.977
it immediately, too.

16:18.018 --> 16:21.188
Poop is weakness

16:18.018 --> 16:21.188
leaving the body.

16:21.230 --> 16:22.064
- You kiddin' me?

16:22.106 --> 16:23.274
- [Hank] Nope!

16:31.365 --> 16:32.575
(door closing)

16:34.160 --> 16:35.328
- Did you guys have fun?

16:35.369 --> 16:38.289
- Yeah, I met a cowboy today.

16:38.331 --> 16:39.749
- You did?

16:39.791 --> 16:41.876
- Yeah, he was sittin'

16:39.791 --> 16:41.876
by himself at the diner,

16:41.918 --> 16:43.252
so I kept him company.

16:43.294 --> 16:45.588
- Oh, that's nice of you.

16:45.630 --> 16:47.006
Go get ready for bed.

16:50.510 --> 16:51.469
A cowboy?

16:51.511 --> 16:53.137
- Yeah.

16:53.179 --> 16:55.974
It was just some

16:53.179 --> 16:55.974
guy from the rodeo.

16:56.015 --> 16:57.350
- You know, you

16:56.015 --> 16:57.350
two aren't making

16:57.391 --> 16:58.643
this week any easier.

16:58.685 --> 16:59.936
- I'm sorry.

17:02.522 --> 17:04.816
- Your dad's waiting

17:02.522 --> 17:04.816
for you in his office.

17:04.858 --> 17:06.317
- Well, that sounds fun.

17:06.359 --> 17:08.235
- Mm-hmm.

17:08.277 --> 17:11.113
You know you can catch

17:08.277 --> 17:11.113
more flies with honey.

17:11.155 --> 17:12.615
- I know, I know.

17:14.325 --> 17:15.368
- Go.

17:22.583 --> 17:25.003
(knocking)

17:25.044 --> 17:26.796
- That was illuminating.

17:28.589 --> 17:31.009
- Dad, I'm sorry.

17:31.050 --> 17:33.887
- Apologize to the

17:31.050 --> 17:33.887
cow you had killed

17:31.050 --> 17:33.887
for your dinner.

17:33.928 --> 17:36.806
- Dad, I just wanted

17:33.928 --> 17:36.806
a burger this one day,

17:36.848 --> 17:38.016
this one time.

17:39.308 --> 17:41.769
- This family stands

17:39.308 --> 17:41.769
for something.

17:41.811 --> 17:43.771
Doesn't the mean

17:41.811 --> 17:43.771
anything to you?

17:45.982 --> 17:47.817
- Yeah, it mostly does.

17:48.985 --> 17:52.530
But, why does it

17:48.985 --> 17:52.530
have to be so rigid?

17:52.572 --> 17:55.616
- You're either

17:52.572 --> 17:55.616
part of the solution

17:55.658 --> 17:58.202
or you're part of the problem.

18:00.538 --> 18:02.040
- Can I go now?

18:02.081 --> 18:02.957
- You can go.

18:12.884 --> 18:15.887

19:43.557 --> 19:44.892

All right, I'm gonna

20:24.431 --> 20:25.808

- Okay.

20:30.604 --> 20:31.397
- Hi.

20:31.438 --> 20:32.523
- Hi.

20:33.983 --> 20:36.443
- I think we got off on

20:33.983 --> 20:36.443
the wrong foot yesterday.

20:36.485 --> 20:37.444
I'm Colton.

20:37.486 --> 20:39.113
- Hi, Colton, I'm Tracy.

20:39.155 --> 20:41.157
- It's nice to meet you.

20:42.200 --> 20:43.868
So what, what's good here.

20:43.910 --> 20:45.953
- Well, if you haven't

20:43.910 --> 20:45.953
tried a tofu dog,

20:45.995 --> 20:47.747
then you really haven't lived.

20:47.788 --> 20:52.210
- Okay, I always wanted

20:47.788 --> 20:52.210
to try new things I guess.

20:53.961 --> 20:56.714
- I see you've

20:53.961 --> 20:56.714
met my girlfriend.

20:58.632 --> 21:01.260
- Didn't see that comin'.

21:01.301 --> 21:04.055
- So, you two know each other?

21:04.097 --> 21:07.266
- Yeah, yeah, we had a nice

21:04.097 --> 21:07.266
conversation yesterday.

21:07.307 --> 21:09.309
Left me feeling a

21:07.307 --> 21:09.309
little deflated, though.

21:09.351 --> 21:12.396
- Aw. That's a real

21:09.351 --> 21:12.396
shame Mr. Cowboy.

21:12.438 --> 21:14.648
Maybe you just don't

21:12.438 --> 21:14.648
belong around here.

21:14.690 --> 21:16.025
- Dylan.

21:16.067 --> 21:18.527
- Yeah, I been

21:16.067 --> 21:18.527
gettin' that a lot.

21:19.862 --> 21:21.989
- Come on babe, gotta

21:19.862 --> 21:21.989
get some tomatoes

21:22.031 --> 21:22.823
for my mom.

21:22.865 --> 21:24.283
- Okay.

21:24.324 --> 21:25.534
Bye Colton.

21:27.703 --> 21:29.247
- Yeah, bye Colton.

21:30.372 --> 21:31.958
- He's a tool.

21:31.999 --> 21:35.086
- Yeah, I kinda

21:31.999 --> 21:35.086
picked up on that.

21:40.549 --> 21:42.551
- You must be the cowboy

21:40.549 --> 21:42.551
everyone's talking about.

21:42.593 --> 21:43.636
I'm Robert.

21:43.677 --> 21:45.138
- Colton, sir.

21:45.179 --> 21:46.639
I heard you speakin' at

21:45.179 --> 21:46.639
the town hall yesterday.

21:46.680 --> 21:48.557
- I thought that was

21:46.680 --> 21:48.557
you that walked in.

21:48.599 --> 21:50.476
You learn anything?

21:50.517 --> 21:52.728
- I learned that you and I

21:50.517 --> 21:52.728
think very differently, sir.

21:52.770 --> 21:54.688
- We all do.

21:54.730 --> 21:56.398
We're a progressive community

21:54.730 --> 21:56.398
with forward thinking ideas

21:56.440 --> 21:57.817
about the world we live in.

21:57.858 --> 22:00.611
Rodeo's from a day

21:57.858 --> 22:00.611
long since passed.

22:00.653 --> 22:01.904
- I don't know, I

22:00.653 --> 22:01.904
think there's still

22:01.946 --> 22:03.447
plenty of cowboys

22:01.946 --> 22:03.447
in America, sir.

22:03.489 --> 22:05.365
- Maybe your rodeo draws a crowd

22:05.407 --> 22:07.118
in some parts of the country,

22:07.160 --> 22:09.620
but so do dog fights.

22:09.662 --> 22:12.123
We stand on the right side

22:09.662 --> 22:12.123
of history with this one.

22:12.165 --> 22:14.500
Luke, go find your mother

22:14.541 --> 22:17.211
and tell her we're heading home.

22:14.541 --> 22:17.211
- But Dad...

22:17.253 --> 22:21.007
- Don't call me "but Dad,"

22:17.253 --> 22:21.007
go find your mom, come on.

22:22.967 --> 22:25.219
Maybe I can't force

22:22.967 --> 22:25.219
you out of our town,

22:25.261 --> 22:27.805
but I suggest while you're here,

22:27.847 --> 22:29.765
you stay on your

22:27.847 --> 22:29.765
side of the tracks

22:29.807 --> 22:32.059
and away from my family.

22:32.101 --> 22:34.645
(somber music)

22:47.449 --> 22:50.203
(engine revving)

22:52.288 --> 22:54.540
- Shouldn't you be driving

22:52.288 --> 22:54.540
a Prius or something.

22:54.581 --> 22:57.751
- Oh, I like havin' a little

22:54.581 --> 22:57.751
muscle between my legs.

22:57.793 --> 23:00.254
(engine revving)

23:01.797 --> 23:02.798
- It's loud.

23:03.883 --> 23:05.592
Is it fast, too?

23:05.634 --> 23:07.678
- Fastest ride in town.

23:11.473 --> 23:14.935
- You wanna put

23:11.473 --> 23:14.935
that to the test?

23:14.977 --> 23:17.688
- You challenin' me to a race?

23:17.730 --> 23:19.606
- I guess I am.

23:19.648 --> 23:22.985
- Well, you really are

23:19.648 --> 23:22.985
dumber than you look

23:23.027 --> 23:25.445
and that's sayin' somethin'.

23:25.487 --> 23:29.200
- 3 o'clock then out

23:25.487 --> 23:29.200
at the fairground.

23:29.242 --> 23:30.659
- Oh, I'll be there.

23:37.208 --> 23:39.335
- Hank.

23:37.208 --> 23:39.335
We all good?

23:39.377 --> 23:41.628
- You got lucky Buddy.

23:39.377 --> 23:41.628
Shawn went into town

23:39.377 --> 23:41.628
to sign some permits.

23:41.670 --> 23:43.089
He didn't even

23:41.670 --> 23:43.089
know you were gone.

23:43.130 --> 23:44.631
- Hey, I need your

23:43.130 --> 23:44.631
help with somethin'.

23:44.673 --> 23:46.800
- Why you always givin'

23:44.673 --> 23:46.800
me stuff to carry?

23:46.842 --> 23:50.054
- No, that's just

23:46.842 --> 23:50.054
some stuff I picked up

23:46.842 --> 23:50.054
at the farmer's market.

23:50.096 --> 23:52.306
- You risk gettin' fired

23:50.096 --> 23:52.306
over some local fruit?

23:52.348 --> 23:54.225
- Do you remember that guy

23:52.348 --> 23:54.225
that was messin' with my tire?

23:54.267 --> 23:55.475
- Is this organic.

23:55.517 --> 23:56.310
- [Colton] Hank!

23:56.352 --> 23:59.021
(crunching)

23:59.063 --> 24:00.981
- [Hank] What?

23:59.063 --> 24:00.981
- Tire guy.

24:01.023 --> 24:03.817
- Oh, yeah, tire

24:01.023 --> 24:03.817
guy, I remember.

24:03.859 --> 24:07.280
- I think he thinks I'm

24:03.859 --> 24:07.280
after his girlfriend.

24:07.321 --> 24:08.781
- Shut up.

24:07.321 --> 24:08.781
You met a girl?

24:08.822 --> 24:11.367
- No. Maybe.

24:11.409 --> 24:13.535
- Colton Burtenshaw,

24:11.409 --> 24:13.535
Mr. Hardworking Cowboy,

24:13.577 --> 24:14.912
falls in love

24:13.577 --> 24:14.912
with a townie.

24:14.954 --> 24:16.663
You know I bet she

24:14.954 --> 24:16.663
shaves her pits.

24:16.705 --> 24:18.540
I knew you had some real

24:16.705 --> 24:18.540
blood flowing in your veins

24:18.582 --> 24:20.542
and not just cow poo.

24:18.582 --> 24:20.542
- What is wrong with you?

24:20.584 --> 24:22.544
- You know if I was

24:20.584 --> 24:22.544
him, I'd just slash

24:20.584 --> 24:22.544
all your tires.

24:22.586 --> 24:24.630
- Hank, we got bigger

24:22.586 --> 24:24.630
problems with now.

24:24.671 --> 24:26.882
- Bigger than a boyfriend

24:24.671 --> 24:26.882
lookin' to kill you

24:26.924 --> 24:27.841
and your vehicle?

24:27.883 --> 24:29.969
- Bigger in scope, yeah.

24:30.010 --> 24:32.430
- I do not know what

24:30.010 --> 24:32.430
that word means.

24:32.470 --> 24:33.680
- Come on, I'll show you.

24:33.722 --> 24:35.641
And it may or may not

24:33.722 --> 24:35.641
have to do with a race

24:35.682 --> 24:39.228
and Trigger and a big ol' truck.

24:39.270 --> 24:43.899
- Sounds stupid.

24:39.270 --> 24:43.899
- [Colton] No, it's

24:39.270 --> 24:43.899
not, trust me, come on.

24:53.491 --> 24:54.492
- Hey Trace.

24:56.578 --> 24:59.165
- Are you serious Dyl?

24:59.206 --> 25:00.582
- What?

25:00.624 --> 25:02.209
- So what, you're

25:00.624 --> 25:02.209
gonna go all macho

25:02.251 --> 25:05.254
on this cowboy with

25:02.251 --> 25:05.254
your big bad truck?

25:05.296 --> 25:07.006
- Why are you mad at me?

25:07.047 --> 25:09.467
He's the one that wanted

25:07.047 --> 25:09.467
to race in the first place.

25:09.507 --> 25:10.843
- Really?

25:10.884 --> 25:13.304
So, you had nothing

25:10.884 --> 25:13.304
to do with it.

25:13.346 --> 25:16.223
Colton just walked

25:13.346 --> 25:16.223
up and challenged you

25:16.265 --> 25:17.350
to some stupid race?

25:17.391 --> 25:19.143
- You worried about me, Trace,

25:19.185 --> 25:20.269
or you worried

25:19.185 --> 25:20.269
somethin' might happen

25:20.311 --> 25:21.561
to your new friend?

25:21.603 --> 25:22.771
- Friend?

25:22.813 --> 25:24.857
I don't even know him.

25:24.898 --> 25:25.774
- Mm-hmm.

25:28.361 --> 25:30.488
- Dylan, you don't

25:28.361 --> 25:30.488
even care what I think.

25:30.528 --> 25:33.157
- You don't care what I think.

25:33.199 --> 25:35.075
- Okay, well great,

25:33.199 --> 25:35.075
don't kill yourself.

25:35.117 --> 25:37.786
- [Dylan] Yeah, I'll try not to.

25:38.620 --> 25:41.248
(door closing)

25:49.798 --> 25:51.467
- Barrel racin'?

25:51.509 --> 25:53.886
This is how you're gonna

25:51.509 --> 25:53.886
impress the town folk?

25:53.927 --> 25:56.180
- It's not exactly

25:53.927 --> 25:56.180
barrel racing.

25:56.222 --> 25:58.224
- No, it's a lot dumber.

25:59.266 --> 26:01.643
Look man, I don't

25:59.266 --> 26:01.643
like that Trigger's

26:01.685 --> 26:02.936
caught up in all this.

26:02.978 --> 26:04.397
- Trigger's gonna

26:02.978 --> 26:04.397
have fun today,

26:04.438 --> 26:06.273
don't worry about that.

26:04.438 --> 26:06.273
- If anything happens to him,

26:06.315 --> 26:08.484
I will kill you before

26:06.315 --> 26:08.484
any boyfriends can.

26:08.526 --> 26:09.985
- I hear you.

26:10.027 --> 26:11.487
- And then Shawn's

26:10.027 --> 26:11.487
gonna kill you again

26:11.529 --> 26:13.864
and he's gonna light

26:11.529 --> 26:13.864
your body on fire.

26:13.906 --> 26:16.783
- Anybody ever tell

26:13.906 --> 26:16.783
you you worry too much?

26:13.906 --> 26:16.783
- No, they don't.

26:16.825 --> 26:19.453
'Cause then I'm gonna go

26:16.825 --> 26:19.453
get some marshmallows, and I'm

26:16.825 --> 26:19.453
gonna stick 'em on a stick

26:19.495 --> 26:20.996
and I'm gonna light

26:19.495 --> 26:20.996
those marshmallows

26:19.495 --> 26:20.996
on your body flames.

26:21.038 --> 26:22.540
- Okay.

26:21.038 --> 26:22.540
- Hey, you know,

26:21.038 --> 26:22.540
why don't we--

26:22.580 --> 26:24.041
Speakin' of flames,

26:22.580 --> 26:24.041
why don't we just

26:24.083 --> 26:26.293
get flamin' hoops

26:24.083 --> 26:26.293
and you just--

26:24.083 --> 26:26.293
- Get back to work.

26:26.335 --> 26:27.545
- All right.

26:27.585 --> 26:30.214
(playful music)

26:42.809 --> 26:45.479
(engine revving)

26:54.488 --> 26:55.948
- Yo, Dyl.

26:55.989 --> 26:58.200
Dude, there's like dirt

26:55.989 --> 26:58.200
all over my mom's Prius.

26:58.242 --> 26:59.910
She's gonna like kill me.

26:59.952 --> 27:01.912
- Dude, shut up.

27:01.954 --> 27:02.955
- All right.

27:06.417 --> 27:07.460
- You made it.

27:07.501 --> 27:09.920
- 3 o'clock as promised.

27:09.962 --> 27:11.088
- Very good.

27:11.130 --> 27:12.298
Well, I laid out a course here.

27:12.339 --> 27:13.799
We start at the poles.

27:13.840 --> 27:15.551
Make sure you go all the

27:13.840 --> 27:15.551
way around the barrels.

27:15.593 --> 27:17.595
A couple surprises

27:15.593 --> 27:17.595
on the back end

27:17.635 --> 27:18.678
and then we're gonna

27:17.635 --> 27:18.678
shoot down here

27:18.720 --> 27:19.972
through the finish line.

27:20.013 --> 27:22.475
But it's nothin'

27:20.013 --> 27:22.475
you can't handle.

27:22.516 --> 27:23.850
- All right.

27:23.892 --> 27:26.186
I'll play your

27:23.892 --> 27:26.186
little cowboy games.

27:26.228 --> 27:27.854
Let's see what you got.

27:27.896 --> 27:29.064
What do you think you can drive

27:29.106 --> 27:30.648
that's gonna beat my ride?

27:30.690 --> 27:32.234
- Oh, you're lookin' at him.

27:32.276 --> 27:33.986
Trigger, I'd like

27:32.276 --> 27:33.986
you to meet Dylan.

27:34.027 --> 27:36.489
Dylan, this is Trigger.

27:36.530 --> 27:38.198
- What is this?

27:38.240 --> 27:39.617
- This is your competition.

27:39.657 --> 27:42.119
One horse power,

27:39.657 --> 27:42.119
that's all I need.

27:42.161 --> 27:45.372
- Really, you're gonna

27:42.161 --> 27:45.372
race me on a horse.

27:45.414 --> 27:48.041
- You're gonna

27:45.414 --> 27:48.041
race us in a truck?

27:48.083 --> 27:51.545
- Aw, let's get

27:48.083 --> 27:51.545
this thing started.

27:51.587 --> 27:52.796
- Let's do it.

27:55.549 --> 27:57.593
(cheering)

28:00.471 --> 28:02.889
(engine revving)

28:07.520 --> 28:09.855
(cheering)

28:41.595 --> 28:43.180
- Hey! Come on!

29:23.887 --> 29:25.847
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what do

29:23.887 --> 29:25.847
you think you're doin'?

29:25.889 --> 29:26.890
- Winnin' pal.

29:29.602 --> 29:31.103
- Yah!

29:31.144 --> 29:32.730
Come on.

29:31.144 --> 29:32.730
Come on!

29:38.902 --> 29:42.489
(cheering and applauding)

29:47.536 --> 29:50.414
(horse whinnying)

29:56.712 --> 29:58.756
- I understand you put on quite

29:58.797 --> 30:00.132
the little show today.

30:00.173 --> 30:02.468
- I got all my work done.

30:03.343 --> 30:04.219
- Well.

30:05.471 --> 30:08.390
You got all your work done.

30:08.432 --> 30:10.016
Well, son of a gun.

30:10.058 --> 30:11.727
Seems to me everybody

30:10.058 --> 30:11.727
around here got all

30:11.769 --> 30:13.353
of their work done today.

30:13.395 --> 30:15.439
But it also seems to me

30:13.395 --> 30:15.439
that there's only one

30:15.481 --> 30:19.276
person's name around

30:15.481 --> 30:19.276
here I keep hearing about

30:19.318 --> 30:21.861
and that name

30:19.318 --> 30:21.861
happens to be yours.

30:21.903 --> 30:23.822
- Shawn, I was standin'

30:21.903 --> 30:23.822
up for the rodeo.

30:23.863 --> 30:25.865
At least the town's

30:23.863 --> 30:25.865
talking about us now.

30:25.907 --> 30:28.786
- You wanna answer to the PPR?

30:28.827 --> 30:32.790
Because some kid in

30:28.827 --> 30:32.790
some town broke his neck

30:32.831 --> 30:35.459
while racing a

30:32.831 --> 30:35.459
cowboy in his truck?

30:42.132 --> 30:44.802
I've had it.

30:42.132 --> 30:44.802
I've had it up to my

30:42.132 --> 30:44.802
eyeballs with this town,

30:44.843 --> 30:46.970
I've had it up to my

30:44.843 --> 30:46.970
eyeballs with you,

30:47.012 --> 30:51.433
with this whole let's

30:47.012 --> 30:51.433
boycott the rodeo nonsense.

30:51.475 --> 30:53.519
Here's a newsflash

30:51.475 --> 30:53.519
for you, Colton.

30:53.560 --> 30:56.104
I'm not gonna let you

30:53.560 --> 30:56.104
ride this weekend.

30:56.146 --> 30:59.399
- But Shawn, I got

30:56.146 --> 30:59.399
a sponsor comin'.

30:59.441 --> 31:01.652
- [Britney] Trace,

30:59.441 --> 31:01.652
you should go see him.

31:01.694 --> 31:03.779
- Okay, so what, what do

31:01.694 --> 31:03.779
I do, just walk in there

31:03.821 --> 31:07.449
and ask someone for the guy

31:03.821 --> 31:07.449
who raced against a truck?

31:07.491 --> 31:09.576
- That sounds like a plan to me.

31:09.618 --> 31:11.911
- What about Dylan?

31:09.618 --> 31:11.911
- What about him?

31:11.953 --> 31:14.247
Look, in my mind, he

31:11.953 --> 31:14.247
lost you in battle.

31:14.289 --> 31:15.749
- Stop.

31:15.791 --> 31:18.460
- Look at the facts

31:15.791 --> 31:18.460
Miss Lawyer Girl.

31:18.502 --> 31:19.461
Dylan bad.

31:20.671 --> 31:21.672
Cowboy good.

31:22.673 --> 31:24.675
(laughing)

31:31.598 --> 31:33.892
- You know this weekend's

31:31.598 --> 31:33.892
big for both of us, right?

31:33.933 --> 31:35.935
- I know, I just,

31:33.933 --> 31:35.935
I got into a beef

31:35.977 --> 31:36.812
with this guy from town.

31:36.854 --> 31:38.605
- A guy from town.

31:40.982 --> 31:43.985
Colton, man, you

31:40.982 --> 31:43.985
gotta start thinkin'

31:44.027 --> 31:45.404
about the big picture.

31:45.445 --> 31:46.780
- I'm sorry.

31:46.822 --> 31:48.866
- Don't be, it's over.

31:48.907 --> 31:50.325
Look, when you turn 30,

31:50.367 --> 31:52.411
you'll stop doin' dumb shit.

31:52.452 --> 31:55.539
Until then, you

31:52.452 --> 31:55.539
gotta shut this down.

31:57.207 --> 31:58.709
- You got it.

31:58.751 --> 32:00.085
- Okay.

32:10.178 --> 32:12.639
(cow mooing)

32:12.681 --> 32:15.225
(gentle music)

32:47.966 --> 32:50.176
(hammering)

32:59.728 --> 33:00.979
- Wow.

33:01.897 --> 33:04.065
Cowboy and a carpenter.

33:04.107 --> 33:05.525
- What are you doin' here?

33:05.567 --> 33:07.736
- Oh, I just thought

33:05.567 --> 33:07.736
that I would come by

33:07.778 --> 33:11.281
and congratulate you

33:07.778 --> 33:11.281
on your big win today.

33:11.323 --> 33:14.367
- Well, uh, you

33:11.323 --> 33:14.367
caught me celebrating.

33:14.409 --> 33:15.452
- Looks fun.

33:16.620 --> 33:18.580
- Yeah, I basically

33:16.620 --> 33:18.580
got my ass handed to me

33:18.622 --> 33:20.332
about the race.

33:20.373 --> 33:23.209
- Yeah, I'm sorry, but

33:20.373 --> 33:23.209
that was kind of stupid.

33:23.251 --> 33:24.920
- I know, I know.

33:24.962 --> 33:26.755
But it's bigger than

33:24.962 --> 33:26.755
just racing a horse

33:26.797 --> 33:28.340
through some dirt, you know.

33:28.381 --> 33:30.216
Like, it's about a man

33:28.381 --> 33:30.216
and an animal working

33:30.258 --> 33:33.052
together for a common goal.

33:33.094 --> 33:35.180
- That sounds important.

33:35.221 --> 33:36.723
- It is.

33:36.765 --> 33:38.391
It is to me anyway.

33:39.935 --> 33:41.019
- I get that.

33:42.562 --> 33:46.024
- Well, hey, I, uh,

33:42.562 --> 33:46.024
think I can punch out.

33:47.442 --> 33:48.902
- With who?

33:48.944 --> 33:50.028
- Rodeo god.

33:50.069 --> 33:51.571
What, it's a thing.

33:51.613 --> 33:52.489
- Yeah.

33:54.032 --> 33:55.492
- You want me to

33:54.032 --> 33:55.492
show you around?

33:55.534 --> 33:57.118
- I do.

33:57.160 --> 33:58.745
I don't need a hammer, do I?

33:58.787 --> 34:01.289
- Oh, no, just an escort.

34:01.331 --> 34:02.624
- Lead the way.

34:05.043 --> 34:07.671
(gentle music)

34:11.925 --> 34:13.635
- Ooh.

34:11.925 --> 34:13.635
- Watch out.

34:13.677 --> 34:15.470
- It's like a minefield in here.

34:15.512 --> 34:16.889
- Nah, I'll get you through.

34:16.930 --> 34:19.224
(cow mooing)

34:19.265 --> 34:21.768
Can't have a rodeo

34:19.265 --> 34:21.768
without these guys.

34:21.810 --> 34:23.311
- Baby calves?

34:23.353 --> 34:26.023
- They're roping steers, but.

34:27.190 --> 34:29.442
- They're really cute.

34:29.484 --> 34:30.443
- I guess so.

34:31.945 --> 34:34.907
- Don't you feel

34:31.945 --> 34:34.907
bad, roping them up

34:34.948 --> 34:37.200
and riding them and stuff?

34:37.242 --> 34:40.412
- You know cowboys don't

34:37.242 --> 34:40.412
actually ride cows, right?

34:40.453 --> 34:42.539
- Come on, I'm serious.

34:43.749 --> 34:46.334
- We only rope 'em

34:43.749 --> 34:46.334
when we have to.

34:46.376 --> 34:47.794
Other than that,

34:46.376 --> 34:47.794
we treat them like

34:47.836 --> 34:49.462
the little princesses

34:47.836 --> 34:49.462
that they are.

34:51.673 --> 34:52.674
Come on.

34:54.467 --> 34:56.720
I want you to meet somebody.

34:56.762 --> 34:59.180
Here's the fierce stallion.

35:04.603 --> 35:07.564
- Wait a minute, his

35:04.603 --> 35:07.564
name's Trigger for real?

35:07.606 --> 35:09.357
- Yeah, it's classic.

35:10.483 --> 35:13.319
- So what's that

35:10.483 --> 35:13.319
make you, John Wayne?

35:13.361 --> 35:16.073
- Uh, Roy Rogers actually.

35:16.114 --> 35:18.992
- Oh, like the restaurant.

35:19.034 --> 35:20.911
- Oh, my gosh, you're

35:19.034 --> 35:20.911
kiddin' me, right?

35:20.953 --> 35:21.870
- Yes.

35:21.912 --> 35:22.871
- Better be.

35:25.415 --> 35:27.834
So what's your story?

35:27.876 --> 35:30.087
You being groomed to take

35:27.876 --> 35:30.087
over the family business?

35:30.128 --> 35:31.504
- Hardly.

35:31.546 --> 35:34.549
I'm off to UC Santa

35:31.546 --> 35:34.549
Cruz next month.

35:35.383 --> 35:36.342
- That sounds cool.

35:36.384 --> 35:37.552
- Yeah, it is.

35:38.678 --> 35:40.138
They have this

35:38.678 --> 35:40.138
joint program where

35:40.179 --> 35:42.599
I can get my bachelor's

35:40.179 --> 35:42.599
degree and my law degree

35:42.641 --> 35:44.059
in six years.

35:44.101 --> 35:46.979
- Are you gonna be a lawyer?

35:47.020 --> 35:49.022
- That's the plan.

35:49.064 --> 35:50.231
- Wow.

35:50.273 --> 35:52.818
You know I could never do that.

35:52.859 --> 35:54.736
Sittin' in a court

35:52.859 --> 35:54.736
room givin' speeches

35:54.778 --> 35:56.863
and askin' questions

35:54.778 --> 35:56.863
and all that.

35:56.905 --> 35:58.448
- Oh, I bet you'd

35:56.905 --> 35:58.448
be better at it

35:58.490 --> 36:00.117
than you think.

36:00.158 --> 36:01.660
- Maybe.

36:01.701 --> 36:04.537
If I was sittin' on

36:01.701 --> 36:04.537
a horse or somethin'.

36:04.579 --> 36:05.831
- No, you just have

36:04.579 --> 36:05.831
to be passionate

36:05.872 --> 36:07.791
about what you're saying.

36:09.208 --> 36:10.919
- Still sounds scary.

36:11.837 --> 36:13.880
- What about you?

36:13.922 --> 36:17.425
Mm, you gonna be a

36:13.922 --> 36:17.425
cowboy your whole life?

36:18.551 --> 36:20.470
- It's all I've known.

36:20.512 --> 36:23.181
I grew up on a ranch up north.

36:23.222 --> 36:24.724
- Family business?

36:26.059 --> 36:28.895
- Four generations

36:26.059 --> 36:28.895
on my dad's side.

36:30.438 --> 36:33.191
- You being groomed to take

36:30.438 --> 36:33.191
over the family business?

36:33.232 --> 36:34.776
- Nah.

36:34.818 --> 36:36.903
We had to get rid of

36:34.818 --> 36:36.903
the ranch a while back,

36:36.945 --> 36:40.657
but I hope to have one

36:36.945 --> 36:40.657
of my own someday.

36:40.699 --> 36:43.869
Till then I'm just

36:40.699 --> 36:43.869
a travelin' cowboy.

36:46.621 --> 36:47.747
- Do you sing?

36:47.789 --> 36:49.833
- What?

36:47.789 --> 36:49.833
No, why?

36:51.250 --> 36:52.836
- I thought all

36:51.250 --> 36:52.836
traveling cowboys sang

36:52.878 --> 36:55.505
and play guitar

36:52.878 --> 36:55.505
under the moonlight.

36:58.050 --> 37:00.385
- You got so much to learn.

37:05.431 --> 37:08.101
Think you're comin' to

37:05.431 --> 37:08.101
the rodeo this weekend?

37:08.143 --> 37:11.104
- Well, now I really want to.

37:11.146 --> 37:14.566
- Well, I'd love it

37:11.146 --> 37:14.566
if you could come.

37:14.607 --> 37:16.693
- I'll see what I can do.

37:17.652 --> 37:19.779
- You gonna get home safe?

37:19.821 --> 37:22.824
- I can drive these roads

37:19.821 --> 37:22.824
with my eyes closed.

37:22.866 --> 37:26.661
- I don't know,

37:22.866 --> 37:26.661
maybe don't do that.

37:26.703 --> 37:28.914
- I won't. I promise.

37:31.875 --> 37:34.169
- You wanna know somethin'?

37:36.171 --> 37:40.383
I would really, really

37:36.171 --> 37:40.383
like to kiss you right now.

37:49.684 --> 37:50.769
- I have a boyfriend.

37:50.810 --> 37:53.605
- Yes, ma'am, I'm aware of that.

37:53.646 --> 37:55.107
I shouldn't have said anything.

37:55.148 --> 37:58.276
- No, it's okay.

37:55.148 --> 37:58.276
- Goodnight, Miss Tracy.

37:58.317 --> 38:01.988
- It has been an

37:58.317 --> 38:01.988
absolute pleasure.

38:02.030 --> 38:04.616
- Goodnight cowboy Colton.

38:04.657 --> 38:07.160
And the pleasure was all mine.

38:08.745 --> 38:10.580
- You know he's a lucky guy.

38:10.622 --> 38:12.999
(gentle music)

38:43.113 --> 38:45.740
(door closing)

38:49.286 --> 38:51.121
- You're late.

38:51.163 --> 38:53.414
- Yeah, I'm sorry, I

38:51.163 --> 38:53.414
totally lost track of time.

38:53.456 --> 38:55.000
- Where were you?

38:55.041 --> 38:58.586
- I was just out at

38:55.041 --> 38:58.586
the diner with Britney.

38:58.628 --> 38:59.921
- It closes at 11.

39:02.465 --> 39:05.802
- Well, we went to

39:02.465 --> 39:05.802
her house afterwards.

39:07.095 --> 39:08.972
- You have a curfew of 12:30.

39:09.014 --> 39:10.807
I don't want to have to

39:09.014 --> 39:10.807
start to check up on you.

39:10.849 --> 39:11.891
- Well, you don't, Dad.

39:11.933 --> 39:13.310
I'm practically in college.

39:13.351 --> 39:14.769
- Does this look

39:13.351 --> 39:14.769
like college to you,

39:14.811 --> 39:16.395
'cause this looks like my home.

39:16.437 --> 39:19.983
It's my home, it's my

39:16.437 --> 39:19.983
rules and in my home

39:20.025 --> 39:20.984
you have a curfew.

39:22.152 --> 39:24.821
- Okay. Fine.

39:24.863 --> 39:27.240
- I heard about what happened

39:24.863 --> 39:27.240
at the fairgrounds today.

39:27.282 --> 39:28.366
Were you there?

39:30.451 --> 39:31.536
- Yeah.

39:31.577 --> 39:33.288
A bunch of us went out there.

39:33.330 --> 39:35.665
- It doesn't help me to

39:33.330 --> 39:35.665
convince the townspeople

39:35.707 --> 39:37.042
that the rodeo's a bad idea

39:37.083 --> 39:38.960
if my own daughter

39:37.083 --> 39:38.960
won't stay away.

39:39.002 --> 39:41.046
- Well, it wasn't the rodeo Dad.

39:41.087 --> 39:42.588
It was a race that Dylan was in.

39:42.630 --> 39:43.882
I had to go.

39:43.923 --> 39:45.550
- Your behavior

39:43.923 --> 39:45.550
reflects upon me.

39:45.591 --> 39:47.219
I don't wanna hear about

39:45.591 --> 39:47.219
you going out there again.

39:47.260 --> 39:48.427
- Okay, fine, Dad, whatever.

39:48.469 --> 39:49.679
I'm going to bed.

39:51.472 --> 39:52.431
- Goodnight.

39:52.473 --> 39:55.185
(door slamming)

39:56.144 --> 39:58.771
(alarm blaring)

40:07.655 --> 40:08.781
(knocking)

40:08.823 --> 40:10.408
- [Hank] Colton, get a move on.

40:10.449 --> 40:13.786
These animals ain't gonna

40:10.449 --> 40:13.786
take care of themselves.

40:13.828 --> 40:15.330
I see you peekin'.

40:16.497 --> 40:20.293
Don't you dare go

40:16.497 --> 40:20.293
back to sleep Colton.

40:20.335 --> 40:21.586
Colton!

40:20.335 --> 40:21.586
- Shoot.

40:21.627 --> 40:23.338
- Come on man.

40:23.380 --> 40:25.673
(gentle music)

40:45.110 --> 40:47.737
Rise and shine sleepin' beauty.

41:39.289 --> 41:40.332

41:40.373 --> 41:42.041
- The cowboy's here.

41:49.299 --> 41:51.592
(laughing)

41:51.634 --> 41:53.970
- He's not my cowboy.

41:54.012 --> 41:58.183
- Okay, I think you

41:54.012 --> 41:58.183
should go talk to him.

41:58.224 --> 42:00.643
- You know I can't do that.

42:00.685 --> 42:03.938
- Your dad's not gonna find out.

42:03.980 --> 42:06.441
- I just promised him I'd

42:03.980 --> 42:06.441
stay away from the rodeo,

42:06.483 --> 42:09.319
so that means Colton, too.

42:09.361 --> 42:11.696
- Okay. Well...

42:11.737 --> 42:14.157
Careful you don't

42:11.737 --> 42:14.157
get that halo wet.

42:21.622 --> 42:22.665
- [Luke] Colton.

42:22.707 --> 42:24.625
- Hey, Luke, how you doin'?

42:24.667 --> 42:26.836
- That was so awesome yesterday.

42:26.878 --> 42:29.214
You made Dyl look

42:26.878 --> 42:29.214
like such a loser.

42:29.255 --> 42:30.340
- Ah.

42:30.382 --> 42:31.590
Hey, why aren't you

42:30.382 --> 42:31.590
out there swimmin'

42:31.632 --> 42:33.510
with everybody else?

42:33.551 --> 42:34.927
- I can't swim.

42:36.637 --> 42:38.723
- Well, hey, you

42:36.637 --> 42:38.723
wanna meet the winner

42:38.764 --> 42:40.433
from yesterday's big race?

42:40.475 --> 42:42.935
- Aren't I talking

42:40.475 --> 42:42.935
to him right now?

42:42.977 --> 42:44.937
- Yeah, I won, but I

42:42.977 --> 42:44.937
didn't do it alone.

42:44.979 --> 42:46.439
Check it out.

42:46.481 --> 42:49.108
Luke, this is Trigger.

42:49.150 --> 42:51.027
You wanna pet him?

42:51.069 --> 42:52.862
- No, I'm okay.

42:52.904 --> 42:55.031
- Come on, it'll be fine,

42:52.904 --> 42:55.031
just right here on the neck.

42:57.616 --> 42:59.452
Ain't it cool, I

42:57.616 --> 42:59.452
think he likes you.

42:59.494 --> 43:00.412
- Whoa.

43:01.704 --> 43:03.581
- Special session

43:01.704 --> 43:03.581
at City Council.

43:03.622 --> 43:06.125
We'd love to see you there.

43:06.167 --> 43:07.544
Special session, oh.

43:07.585 --> 43:08.794
- Hey, Robert.

43:08.836 --> 43:10.588
Is this about the rodeo?

43:08.836 --> 43:10.588
- Yes.

43:10.629 --> 43:13.216
We gotta get our voices heard.

43:10.629 --> 43:13.216
Power to the people, Ed.

43:13.258 --> 43:15.051
Mayor can't make decisions

43:13.258 --> 43:15.051
we don't agree with.

43:15.093 --> 43:16.010
- I hear ya.

43:16.052 --> 43:17.220
- It's gonna happen at lunch,

43:17.262 --> 43:18.763
so if you slip out, it

43:17.262 --> 43:18.763
won't take too long.

43:18.804 --> 43:19.972
- I'll swing by the house,

43:20.014 --> 43:21.516
pick up Jody and I'll,

43:20.014 --> 43:21.516
I'll see you there.

43:21.558 --> 43:23.142
- Countin' on you Ed.

43:23.184 --> 43:24.643
Special session at City Council.

43:24.685 --> 43:26.645
Special session at City Council.

43:26.687 --> 43:28.273
Hey, Paul, how you doin'?

43:28.314 --> 43:29.815
- Oh, thank you.

43:29.857 --> 43:32.651
(horse whinnying)

43:34.653 --> 43:35.654
- Whoa.

43:39.825 --> 43:40.868
Good boy.

43:44.330 --> 43:45.790
- Colton.

43:45.831 --> 43:47.833
- Hey. What are you

43:45.831 --> 43:47.833
doin' here?

43:47.875 --> 43:49.835
- Can you teach me

43:47.875 --> 43:49.835
how to be a cowboy?

43:49.877 --> 43:51.588
- You wanna be a cowboy?

43:51.629 --> 43:53.339
- [Luke] Oh, yeah.

43:53.381 --> 43:55.049
- You just met your first horse

43:53.381 --> 43:55.049
like 10 minutes ago.

43:55.091 --> 43:57.385
- Well, what else is there?

43:58.970 --> 44:00.638
- All right.

44:00.679 --> 44:03.141
Why the sudden interest

44:00.679 --> 44:03.141
in wantin' to be a cowboy?

44:03.182 --> 44:04.350
- Well.

44:04.392 --> 44:06.685
Girls like cowboys.

44:06.727 --> 44:08.938
- What makes you say that?

44:09.897 --> 44:11.690
- My sister likes you.

44:14.068 --> 44:16.237
- All right. Well, let me

44:14.068 --> 44:16.237
show you the ropes.

44:16.279 --> 44:19.031
And like really,

44:16.279 --> 44:19.031
there are ropes.

44:21.951 --> 44:24.870
Just set the bucket

44:21.951 --> 44:24.870
right over there.

44:24.912 --> 44:25.955
There you go.

44:27.248 --> 44:28.416
And stay back.

44:29.250 --> 44:30.793
Now the idea is to stay away

44:30.835 --> 44:33.588
from the business end,

44:30.835 --> 44:33.588
so come on over here.

44:33.630 --> 44:34.964
Here you go boy.

44:36.674 --> 44:38.801
Use a little brush.

44:38.843 --> 44:41.012
And just nice and

44:38.843 --> 44:41.012
easy go with the flow

44:41.053 --> 44:42.721
of their hair.

44:42.763 --> 44:45.975
You got it, you can go a

44:42.763 --> 44:45.975
little harder than that.

44:46.017 --> 44:47.143
Good.

44:49.604 --> 44:51.981
You gotta do this every day.

44:56.569 --> 44:57.529
Ooh.

44:57.570 --> 44:58.821
- Whoa.

44:58.863 --> 45:00.448
- It's only poop.

45:00.490 --> 45:04.160
Gotta get used to it if

45:00.490 --> 45:04.160
you wanna be a cowboy.

45:05.620 --> 45:07.664
You ever pet a sheep before?

45:07.704 --> 45:08.873
Check it out.

45:08.914 --> 45:11.459
Let's give him a little nibble.

45:11.501 --> 45:12.502
That's it.

45:13.710 --> 45:14.711
That's it.

45:16.673 --> 45:18.090
How cool is that?

45:20.843 --> 45:23.429
Good job. You wanna

45:20.843 --> 45:23.429
give him a little more?

45:23.471 --> 45:25.223
Here's a little more.

45:27.308 --> 45:28.601
All right, put your foot in.

45:28.643 --> 45:31.020
Now swing your leg up.

45:31.062 --> 45:33.356
No, no, no, swing

45:31.062 --> 45:33.356
it over the back.

45:33.398 --> 45:35.316
Hand on the horn

45:33.398 --> 45:35.316
lookin' forward.

45:35.358 --> 45:37.943
There you go, that's it.

45:37.985 --> 45:39.028
Good boy.

45:39.070 --> 45:40.363
You got it?

45:40.405 --> 45:41.656
Good work.

45:41.698 --> 45:43.157
How's it feel?

45:43.199 --> 45:44.617
- Good.

45:44.659 --> 45:46.619
- Now you're a cowboy.

45:46.661 --> 45:47.704
Hit some.

45:49.955 --> 45:51.624
- It's getting late.

45:53.501 --> 45:54.586
Where's Luke?

45:55.587 --> 45:56.879
Have you guys seen Luke?

45:56.921 --> 45:58.631
- [Girl] Nope, sorry.

45:58.673 --> 45:59.798
- My dad's gonna kill me

45:59.840 --> 46:01.050
if we're not back for dinner.

46:01.092 --> 46:02.927
- Well, his bike is gone.

46:02.968 --> 46:04.845
Maybe he just left.

46:04.887 --> 46:07.181
- And I think I know where.

46:12.687 --> 46:15.106
- Okay, man remember

46:12.687 --> 46:15.106
chin down, chest out,

46:15.147 --> 46:17.942
lift on that rope

46:15.147 --> 46:17.942
and keep pulsin'.

46:17.983 --> 46:18.943
Ready?

46:21.362 --> 46:22.739
Lift.

46:22.779 --> 46:24.490
Bear down.

46:22.779 --> 46:24.490
Bear down!

46:24.532 --> 46:25.908
- How's he stay on?

46:25.950 --> 46:28.703
- He's been doin'

46:25.950 --> 46:28.703
it a long time.

46:28.745 --> 46:31.497
You know he's one of the

46:28.745 --> 46:31.497
best bull riders in the PBR?

46:31.539 --> 46:33.332
We're lucky to have him.

46:33.374 --> 46:34.833
He just needs a few more points

46:34.875 --> 46:36.877
to get back to the big show.

46:36.919 --> 46:37.878
- Get back?

46:39.130 --> 46:41.633
- Yeah, he took a rough

46:39.130 --> 46:41.633
spill about a year back.

46:41.674 --> 46:43.635
He doesn't always stay on.

46:44.843 --> 46:46.471
- I knew I'd find you here.

46:46.512 --> 46:48.306
- Colton's teaching

46:46.512 --> 46:48.306
me how to be a cowboy.

46:48.347 --> 46:49.848
- Luke, Dad would be

46:48.347 --> 46:49.848
so pissed if he knew

46:49.890 --> 46:51.808
you were here.

46:49.890 --> 46:51.808
- Why?

46:51.850 --> 46:53.060
- Yeah, we're not

46:51.850 --> 46:53.060
doin' anything wrong.

46:53.102 --> 46:55.647
- We're not supposed to be here.

46:57.231 --> 46:58.274
At all.

47:00.901 --> 47:02.027
- I should probably go.

47:02.069 --> 47:04.697
Thanks for helpin' me today.

47:04.739 --> 47:05.698
- I'm sorry.

47:09.868 --> 47:11.788
- Bear down.

47:09.868 --> 47:11.788
Come on Vince!

47:11.828 --> 47:13.748
- I passed out over

47:11.828 --> 47:13.748
300 flyers today.

47:13.790 --> 47:16.041
We're gonna have a good showing

47:13.790 --> 47:16.041
at the meeting tomorrow.

47:16.083 --> 47:17.209
- That's great.

47:19.337 --> 47:20.338
- Thank you.

47:23.090 --> 47:26.761
Tracy, Luke, don't make

47:23.090 --> 47:26.761
any plans tomorrow.

47:26.803 --> 47:28.513
I'm gonna need

47:26.803 --> 47:28.513
your support, okay?

47:28.554 --> 47:30.389
- Sure Dad.

47:30.431 --> 47:32.308
- [Patty] Hey, did you guys

47:30.431 --> 47:32.308
go to Potter's Creek today.

47:32.350 --> 47:33.976
It was so hot.

47:34.018 --> 47:35.478
- Yeah, it was great.

47:37.814 --> 47:39.732
- You go in the water?

47:39.774 --> 47:41.066
- Not exactly.

47:41.108 --> 47:42.901
No, he'd rather buzz around

47:42.943 --> 47:45.237
on the stupid bike than

47:42.943 --> 47:45.237
ever go in the water.

47:45.279 --> 47:46.823
- I just don't like getting in

47:46.863 --> 47:48.449
with all the people.

47:48.491 --> 47:49.701
- Tracy.

47:49.742 --> 47:50.785
Don't tease him.

47:50.827 --> 47:51.952
- He's such a wimp.

47:51.994 --> 47:54.246
- Colton doesn't think so.

47:54.288 --> 47:56.415
- Wait, the rodeo guy?

47:56.457 --> 47:58.250
He was there?

47:58.292 --> 48:00.294
- He just came down to

47:58.292 --> 48:00.294
the river that's all.

48:00.336 --> 48:02.004
- You know him, too.

48:02.046 --> 48:03.255
- Dad, he's so awesome.

48:03.297 --> 48:04.465
He showed me around the rodeo.

48:04.507 --> 48:06.008
I met his horse.

48:06.050 --> 48:07.009
- Today?

48:07.051 --> 48:08.927
- [Luke] Yeah.

48:08.969 --> 48:11.222
- You were supposed

48:08.969 --> 48:11.222
to be watching him.

48:08.969 --> 48:11.222
- I was.

48:11.263 --> 48:12.931
- By lettin' him hang

48:11.263 --> 48:12.931
out with a cowboy.

48:12.973 --> 48:14.308
- Well, he obviously

48:12.973 --> 48:14.308
took care of him.

48:14.350 --> 48:15.476
- You don't even know this guy.

48:15.518 --> 48:17.102
- Yes, I do.

48:17.144 --> 48:18.895
Dad, maybe you don't know

48:17.144 --> 48:18.895
anything about rodeos.

48:18.937 --> 48:23.317
- Wait, wait, have you been

48:18.937 --> 48:23.317
hanging out with this guy?

48:25.528 --> 48:26.987
You like this guy?

48:29.657 --> 48:32.827
You think he even

48:29.657 --> 48:32.827
cares about you?

48:32.869 --> 48:35.872
I mean a small town girl

48:32.869 --> 48:35.872
on one of his stopovers

48:35.912 --> 48:36.748
around the country.

48:36.789 --> 48:38.290
- Robert.

48:38.332 --> 48:40.084
- Thanks, Dad.

48:40.125 --> 48:41.627
Thanks for thinking of me

48:41.669 --> 48:44.129
as just some small town girl.

48:47.759 --> 48:50.469
(door slamming)

48:50.511 --> 48:51.763
- I love you babe,

48:51.804 --> 48:54.640
but sometimes you

48:51.804 --> 48:54.640
take it too far.

48:55.850 --> 48:58.436
(gentle music)

49:16.161 --> 49:17.121
- Hey.

49:18.289 --> 49:19.457
- Hey.

49:24.754 --> 49:26.338
What are you doin'?

49:28.257 --> 49:32.595
- Well, my truck took a

49:28.257 --> 49:32.595
bit of a beating yesterday.

49:32.637 --> 49:36.390
- Yeah, well, that was

49:32.637 --> 49:36.390
a pretty wild race.

49:36.432 --> 49:37.308
- Yeah.

49:38.434 --> 49:40.185
Cowboy did all right.

49:44.774 --> 49:48.611
- Everybody was asking

49:44.774 --> 49:48.611
about you at the river.

49:49.612 --> 49:50.488
- Cool.

49:53.365 --> 49:56.201
- Dylan, we need

49:53.365 --> 49:56.201
to talk about us.

49:59.371 --> 50:01.582
- Yeah, what's there to say?

50:03.584 --> 50:04.669
- I love you Dyl.

50:06.337 --> 50:08.923
I have since I was five.

50:08.965 --> 50:12.468
And what we've had

50:08.965 --> 50:12.468
together has been good.

50:13.678 --> 50:14.887
When it's good.

50:17.556 --> 50:19.725
- What are you saying?

50:19.767 --> 50:22.478
- I'm saying we've

50:19.767 --> 50:22.478
grown apart this summer.

50:22.520 --> 50:23.938
Way, way apart.

50:23.980 --> 50:25.523
And I think we can

50:23.980 --> 50:25.523
both agree on that

50:25.564 --> 50:27.692
and this is not anybody's fault.

50:27.733 --> 50:30.235
I think it's just

50:27.733 --> 50:30.235
something that happens.

50:30.277 --> 50:31.779
I mean, we're both going

50:30.277 --> 50:31.779
to different colleges

50:31.821 --> 50:33.489
in a few weeks.

50:33.531 --> 50:36.116
And if we fight like

50:33.531 --> 50:36.116
we do in the same town,

50:36.158 --> 50:39.871
how are we gonna make a long

50:36.158 --> 50:39.871
distance relationship work.

50:42.206 --> 50:44.542
- So is that your closing

50:42.206 --> 50:44.542
argument counselor?

50:55.761 --> 50:57.805
- I'm sorry Dyl.

50:57.847 --> 50:58.764
- Me, too.

51:09.483 --> 51:11.360
- I'll see you around?

51:12.987 --> 51:13.863
- Yeah.

51:18.826 --> 51:19.869
Hey.

51:21.537 --> 51:24.623
You're gonna make

51:21.537 --> 51:24.623
a hell of a lawyer.

51:25.499 --> 51:26.375
- Thanks.

51:27.459 --> 51:29.754
- Probably a

51:27.459 --> 51:29.754
divorce lawyer, but.

51:43.642 --> 51:45.143
(knocking)

51:45.185 --> 51:46.562
- I'm goin' to bed.

51:48.230 --> 51:50.274
- Our little girl's gone.

51:50.315 --> 51:52.484
- Our little girl

51:50.315 --> 51:52.484
was gone the day

51:52.526 --> 51:54.403
she started middle school.

51:54.445 --> 51:56.072
- Only this is different.

51:56.112 --> 51:58.240
- Honey, this is nothing.

51:59.408 --> 52:02.912
A rodeo, cowboy, I mean,

51:59.408 --> 52:02.912
it's right on schedule.

52:05.121 --> 52:08.292
- I just, I don't

52:05.121 --> 52:08.292
want her to get hurt.

52:08.333 --> 52:10.962
- Well, I can't promise

52:08.333 --> 52:10.962
you that she won't.

52:11.003 --> 52:12.838
It comes with the territory.

52:12.880 --> 52:14.966
- I don't know if

52:12.880 --> 52:14.966
I can handle that.

52:15.007 --> 52:16.968
- Well, I think

52:15.007 --> 52:16.968
you're gonna have to,

52:17.009 --> 52:19.595
'cause you either get on board

52:21.472 --> 52:23.557
or you get left behind.

52:23.599 --> 52:25.643
- I wish it was that easy.

52:26.894 --> 52:29.063
- That's what you have me for.

52:29.105 --> 52:30.940
'Cause I challenge you.

52:32.566 --> 52:34.443
And I raise your game.

52:36.112 --> 52:38.405
And I'm not goin' anywhere.

52:41.742 --> 52:43.744
I seem to remember another

52:43.786 --> 52:46.288
very sexy rebellious teenager.

52:47.539 --> 52:49.667
- That doesn't really help.

52:49.708 --> 52:51.794
- Don't stay up too late.

52:54.588 --> 52:57.173
(gentle music)

53:05.516 --> 53:07.225
- Gosh, man.

53:07.267 --> 53:08.727
I'm beat.

53:08.769 --> 53:11.689
- No one told you to

53:08.769 --> 53:11.689
stay up till 1 a.m.

53:11.730 --> 53:13.357
- How'd you know I did that?

53:13.398 --> 53:15.191
- Look around you, man.

53:15.233 --> 53:17.319
You think we got anything else

53:15.233 --> 53:17.319
to talk about around here?

53:17.361 --> 53:21.866
Our last conversation was

53:17.361 --> 53:21.866
about dirt, true story.

53:21.907 --> 53:23.199
- [Tracy] Colton.

53:23.241 --> 53:25.953
- Tracy, what are

53:23.241 --> 53:25.953
you doing here?

53:26.829 --> 53:28.747
- Can we talk?

53:28.789 --> 53:29.665
- Yeah.

53:32.626 --> 53:34.252
- Looks like another long night.

53:34.294 --> 53:35.171
- Shut up.

53:39.800 --> 53:42.011
- [Tracy] I just

53:39.800 --> 53:42.011
thought you should know.

53:42.053 --> 53:44.805
- So your dad's behind all this?

53:45.806 --> 53:47.391
- Yeah.

53:47.432 --> 53:49.185
He's on a mission.

53:50.310 --> 53:52.646
- Man, he must be

53:50.310 --> 53:52.646
beside himself.

53:52.688 --> 53:54.940
- Oh, no, if it

53:52.688 --> 53:54.940
wasn't the rodeo,

53:54.982 --> 53:57.068
it would be something else.

53:57.109 --> 54:01.237
- No, I'm talking about

53:57.109 --> 54:01.237
you leavin' for college.

54:01.279 --> 54:03.199
- No.

54:03.239 --> 54:06.410
I think he's happy

54:03.239 --> 54:06.410
just to get rid of me.

54:06.451 --> 54:08.244
- You're his little girl.

54:11.540 --> 54:12.750
- Were your parents

54:11.540 --> 54:12.750
mad when you up

54:12.791 --> 54:14.543
and joined the rodeo?

54:16.087 --> 54:18.338
- They had bigger problems.

54:20.465 --> 54:22.551
- What does that mean?

54:24.678 --> 54:26.847
- I had a little brother.

54:26.889 --> 54:29.141
His name was Tommy.

54:29.183 --> 54:32.519
He would've been about

54:29.183 --> 54:32.519
Luke's age by now.

54:35.731 --> 54:37.066
- What happened?

54:40.611 --> 54:44.156
- My dad and I were

54:40.611 --> 54:44.156
bringing in the cattle.

54:45.323 --> 54:48.869
Tommy wasn't even

54:45.323 --> 54:48.869
supposed to be there.

54:48.911 --> 54:50.829
He was always so eager.

54:54.792 --> 54:56.210
And I don't know.

54:57.586 --> 55:01.632
The cattle got spooked and

54:57.586 --> 55:01.632
he slipped through the fence.

55:03.634 --> 55:05.469
I couldn't get to him.

55:08.973 --> 55:10.474
He didn't make it.

55:20.567 --> 55:22.278
- Your poor parents.

55:24.822 --> 55:27.783
- Yeah, my mom blamed my dad.

55:27.825 --> 55:31.036
She never let him live it down.

55:31.078 --> 55:33.664
And I guess one day

55:31.078 --> 55:33.664
my dad had enough

55:33.705 --> 55:35.707
and he just up and left.

55:37.835 --> 55:39.711
He didn't say

55:37.835 --> 55:39.711
goodbye or anything.

55:39.753 --> 55:41.463
He just disappeared.

55:42.840 --> 55:44.633
- I'm so sorry Colton.

55:46.177 --> 55:50.848
- It's just I, I look at

55:46.177 --> 55:50.848
your life and I miss that.

55:50.889 --> 55:54.143
I wish my family still

55:50.889 --> 55:54.143
looked like that.

55:54.185 --> 55:55.769
- I get that.

55:55.811 --> 55:57.562
- And I know family is hard.

55:57.604 --> 56:00.565
I remember fightin'

55:57.604 --> 56:00.565
with my folks.

56:02.400 --> 56:04.402
But, we lost that fight.

56:06.738 --> 56:09.574
Your folks are

56:06.738 --> 56:09.574
still in your life.

56:11.243 --> 56:12.203
- Yeah.

56:13.787 --> 56:16.290
- And now you're leavin' them.

56:18.083 --> 56:21.337
Leavin's hard, it's

56:18.083 --> 56:21.337
always gonna be hard.

56:29.053 --> 56:30.721
- Yeah.

56:30.762 --> 56:32.348
- Hey.

56:32.388 --> 56:33.598
But there's a good way to do it

56:33.640 --> 56:35.767
and there's a bad way to do it.

56:35.809 --> 56:38.354
And the bad way

56:35.809 --> 56:38.354
hurts a lot worse.

56:40.189 --> 56:42.607
- You wanna know something?

56:42.649 --> 56:44.276
- What's that?

56:44.318 --> 56:47.279
- I really wanna

56:44.318 --> 56:47.279
kiss you right ow.

56:48.739 --> 56:51.616
- You wanna know somethin'.

56:51.658 --> 56:54.078
You have a boyfriend.

56:54.119 --> 56:55.287
- Not anymore.

56:56.412 --> 56:59.208
(gentle music)

57:23.899 --> 57:25.776
(knocking)

57:25.817 --> 57:27.152
- Just a second.

57:31.949 --> 57:33.409
What?

57:31.949 --> 57:33.409
- Sorry to

57:31.949 --> 57:33.409
bother you, sir,

57:33.450 --> 57:34.743
but I found this flyer.

57:34.785 --> 57:36.453
- You found the flyer?

57:36.494 --> 57:38.956
- Yeah, look, they're

57:36.494 --> 57:38.956
tryin' to shut us down.

57:38.997 --> 57:40.332
- I know what they're

57:38.997 --> 57:40.332
tryin' to do Colton.

57:40.374 --> 57:42.209
I've seen the flyer, okay?

57:42.251 --> 57:43.668
- Well, what are we

57:42.251 --> 57:43.668
gonna do about it?

57:43.710 --> 57:45.545
- Well, I'll tell

57:43.710 --> 57:45.545
you what we're gonna

57:43.710 --> 57:45.545
do about it.

57:45.587 --> 57:46.838
You're gonna go out

57:45.587 --> 57:46.838
there and you're gonna

57:46.880 --> 57:48.882
do your job or you're

57:46.880 --> 57:48.882
going to lose it.

57:48.924 --> 57:50.217
- I am doing my job.

57:50.259 --> 57:53.304
(door slamming)

57:53.345 --> 57:55.847
Hey, that is my problem, okay?

57:57.557 --> 57:59.268
I'll handle it.

57:59.310 --> 58:01.645
Now throw that

57:59.310 --> 58:01.645
thing in the trash.

58:01.686 --> 58:02.771
- Yes, sir.

58:02.813 --> 58:05.482
(door slamming)

58:05.899 --> 58:07.484
- We have to get

58:05.899 --> 58:07.484
everybody on board.

58:07.525 --> 58:09.694
Otherwise we can't

58:07.525 --> 58:09.694
legally stop it.

58:09.736 --> 58:11.405
- I am glad you

58:09.736 --> 58:11.405
called me Robert.

58:11.447 --> 58:13.240
This is exactly

58:11.447 --> 58:13.240
the kind of fight

58:13.282 --> 58:15.451
the ARA needs to be

58:13.282 --> 58:15.451
having right now.

58:15.492 --> 58:17.494
- Have you guys

58:15.492 --> 58:17.494
stopped other rodeos?

58:17.535 --> 58:19.704
- Rodeos are one of

58:17.535 --> 58:19.704
the top enemies for us.

58:19.746 --> 58:22.458
It is a true violation

58:19.746 --> 58:22.458
of animal rights.

58:22.499 --> 58:23.834
- Well, this town is all about

58:23.875 --> 58:25.543
supporting the animal rights.

58:25.585 --> 58:29.881
- I think we're gonna do

58:25.585 --> 58:29.881
some good work here today.

58:34.970 --> 58:36.013
- Colton.

58:36.054 --> 58:37.264
Did you hear?

58:37.306 --> 58:38.682
They're gonna shut us down.

58:38.723 --> 58:40.017
- Yeah, I heard.

58:40.058 --> 58:41.935
- What do you mean you heard?

58:41.977 --> 58:43.770
You need to get to that meetin'.

58:43.812 --> 58:47.024
- I'd make things worse.

58:43.812 --> 58:47.024
- What are you talkin' about?

58:47.065 --> 58:49.401
You're like the only person

58:47.065 --> 58:49.401
around here that even

58:47.065 --> 58:49.401
cares about this thing.

58:49.443 --> 58:52.779
- Shawn and Vince care,

58:49.443 --> 58:52.779
and they blame me

58:49.443 --> 58:52.779
for the whole mess.

58:52.821 --> 58:55.782
- What, that it's

58:52.821 --> 58:55.782
your fault the whole town

58:52.821 --> 58:55.782
doesn't like the rodeo?

58:55.824 --> 58:58.118
- No, that I made it worse.

58:58.160 --> 59:00.204
- Shut up, they're just

58:58.160 --> 59:00.204
lookin' for someone to blame.

59:00.245 --> 59:01.705
Go to the meeting.

59:01.746 --> 59:03.248
- You know Shawn's

59:01.746 --> 59:03.248
gonna be there.

59:03.290 --> 59:04.541
And he threatened to

59:03.290 --> 59:04.541
tell the wrangler rep

59:04.582 --> 59:05.792
that I caused the whole problem.

59:05.834 --> 59:07.044
- They're just blowin' smoke.

59:07.085 --> 59:09.671
- He'd fire me on the

59:07.085 --> 59:09.671
spot and you know it.

59:09.713 --> 59:11.423
- You're missing the

59:09.713 --> 59:11.423
bigger picture here Colt.

59:11.465 --> 59:13.258
Those are businessmen.

59:13.300 --> 59:15.344
They care about money.

59:15.386 --> 59:18.013
You care about us.

59:15.386 --> 59:18.013
You care about this rodeo.

59:18.055 --> 59:19.639
For real man, this

59:18.055 --> 59:19.639
is actually somethin'

59:19.681 --> 59:22.684
that you're passionate about.

59:22.726 --> 59:24.602
- Well, what if I.

59:24.644 --> 59:26.355
- You know I'm right.

59:27.856 --> 59:30.150
- Yeah.

59:27.856 --> 59:30.150
Yeah, you are.

59:30.192 --> 59:31.527
- I know, I usually am man.

59:31.568 --> 59:32.736
- All right, cover for me.

59:32.777 --> 59:33.695
- Yeah.

59:38.116 --> 59:41.245
- So I'm suggesting to

59:38.116 --> 59:41.245
you ladies and gentlemen,

59:41.286 --> 59:43.580
the decision to shut us down

59:46.250 --> 59:49.294
solely based on your

59:46.250 --> 59:49.294
personal beliefs

59:50.504 --> 59:53.298
is nothing short

59:50.504 --> 59:53.298
of irresponsible.

59:57.469 --> 59:58.595
Thank you.

59:58.636 --> 1:00:01.056
(applauding)

1:00:05.602 --> 1:00:08.439
- I appreciate

1:00:05.602 --> 1:00:08.439
your concern, sir.

1:00:09.565 --> 1:00:13.444
But your rodeo is

1:00:09.565 --> 1:00:13.444
within our city limits

1:00:13.485 --> 1:00:18.115
and we have the final say on

1:00:13.485 --> 1:00:18.115
whether or not it happens.

1:00:18.156 --> 1:00:23.120
If all five council

1:00:18.156 --> 1:00:23.120
members vote nay,

1:00:23.161 --> 1:00:24.662
we will overturn

1:00:23.161 --> 1:00:24.662
the mayor's decision

1:00:24.704 --> 1:00:27.541
and there will be no rodeo.

1:00:28.083 --> 1:00:29.460
And there's nothing

1:00:28.083 --> 1:00:29.460
you can do about it

1:00:29.501 --> 1:00:31.836
legally or otherwise.

1:00:33.422 --> 1:00:37.008
Now to enlighten

1:00:33.422 --> 1:00:37.008
you all on the evil

1:00:37.050 --> 1:00:42.222
of the rodeo, I've

1:00:37.050 --> 1:00:42.222
invited ARA representative

1:00:42.264 --> 1:00:45.225
Gary Smoot to say a few words.

1:00:45.267 --> 1:00:48.270
(applauding)

1:00:57.237 --> 1:01:00.574
- Thank you all for

1:00:57.237 --> 1:01:00.574
inviting me to take part

1:01:00.616 --> 1:01:04.536
in your honorable

1:01:00.616 --> 1:01:04.536
cause to put a halt

1:01:04.578 --> 1:01:08.290
to the barbaric

1:01:04.578 --> 1:01:08.290
practice of rodeo events

1:01:08.332 --> 1:01:09.874
in your city.

1:01:10.250 --> 1:01:11.751
I would like to show you

1:01:11.793 --> 1:01:14.004
some of the horrors

1:01:11.793 --> 1:01:14.004
that are taking place

1:01:14.045 --> 1:01:16.465
in the name of entertainment.

1:01:20.636 --> 1:01:23.054
Rodeo performers

1:01:20.636 --> 1:01:23.054
entertain the audience

1:01:23.096 --> 1:01:26.724
by provoking animals

1:01:23.096 --> 1:01:26.724
into unnatural behavior

1:01:27.934 --> 1:01:31.355
to make them look

1:01:27.934 --> 1:01:31.355
more impressive.

1:01:31.396 --> 1:01:34.566
They jolt the animals

1:01:31.396 --> 1:01:34.566
with electricity

1:01:34.608 --> 1:01:36.610
to make them more aggressive

1:01:36.652 --> 1:01:38.069
than they really are.

1:01:39.321 --> 1:01:41.573
They wrap bucking straps around

1:01:41.615 --> 1:01:45.202
the abdomen and

1:01:41.615 --> 1:01:45.202
groin of the animals

1:01:45.243 --> 1:01:49.498
and burn their skin to

1:01:45.243 --> 1:01:49.498
make them buck wildly.

1:01:49.540 --> 1:01:52.167
Riders yank calves into the air

1:01:53.210 --> 1:01:56.087
and slam them on the ground

1:01:56.129 --> 1:01:59.966
while they cry out

1:01:56.129 --> 1:01:59.966
and defecate in fear.

1:02:00.008 --> 1:02:03.470
Rodeos are constant

1:02:00.008 --> 1:02:03.470
trauma for the animals

1:02:03.512 --> 1:02:05.222
forced to participate.

1:02:05.263 --> 1:02:07.098
They suffer horrible injuries.

1:02:07.140 --> 1:02:08.517
- Wait.

1:02:13.564 --> 1:02:15.399
None of that's true.

1:02:15.440 --> 1:02:18.068
- [Gary] The ARA

1:02:15.440 --> 1:02:18.068
stands by these facts.

1:02:18.109 --> 1:02:19.444
- [Robert] Thank you Gary.

1:02:19.486 --> 1:02:20.820
I think you've

1:02:19.486 --> 1:02:20.820
proved your point.

1:02:20.862 --> 1:02:23.198
(applauding)

1:02:29.329 --> 1:02:32.290
- I'm sorry, son, we've

1:02:29.329 --> 1:02:32.290
already heard from your side.

1:02:32.332 --> 1:02:33.458
We're gonna vote.

1:02:33.500 --> 1:02:35.085
Please sit down.

1:02:36.503 --> 1:02:39.506
- Mr. Councilman,

1:02:36.503 --> 1:02:39.506
if I may be heard.

1:02:42.884 --> 1:02:44.302
I don't mean any disrespect,

1:02:44.344 --> 1:02:45.970
but this young man

1:02:44.344 --> 1:02:45.970
has a right to tell

1:02:46.012 --> 1:02:48.139
the people of your

1:02:46.012 --> 1:02:48.139
city what he believes.

1:02:48.181 --> 1:02:52.227
And out of respect to

1:02:48.181 --> 1:02:52.227
everybody who's here today,

1:02:52.269 --> 1:02:54.812
let's hear what

1:02:52.269 --> 1:02:54.812
the kid has to say.

1:02:54.854 --> 1:02:56.314
- Yeah, man.

1:02:56.356 --> 1:02:58.609
(applauding)

1:03:03.863 --> 1:03:05.323
- Okay, okay.

1:03:05.365 --> 1:03:08.660
Hey, everyone, settle

1:03:05.365 --> 1:03:08.660
down, settle down.

1:03:11.580 --> 1:03:12.664
Colton, is it?

1:03:12.706 --> 1:03:13.790
- Yes, sir.

1:03:15.959 --> 1:03:18.086
- You have the floor.

1:03:18.128 --> 1:03:19.588
- Thank you, sir.

1:03:37.188 --> 1:03:39.483
This gentleman, Gary,

1:03:39.524 --> 1:03:43.403
has shown you all some

1:03:39.524 --> 1:03:43.403
very serious animal abuse.

1:03:43.445 --> 1:03:46.156
And having seen

1:03:43.445 --> 1:03:46.156
that, I would vote

1:03:46.197 --> 1:03:48.241
right along side

1:03:46.197 --> 1:03:48.241
y'all to shut down

1:03:48.283 --> 1:03:52.287
whoever was doin' this

1:03:48.283 --> 1:03:52.287
to our animal friends.

1:03:52.329 --> 1:03:53.664
But it's not true.

1:03:54.914 --> 1:03:58.084
That is not what

1:03:54.914 --> 1:03:58.084
we do in our rodeo.

1:03:58.126 --> 1:04:00.587
I was raised on a ranch.

1:04:00.629 --> 1:04:02.380
I lived side by side

1:04:00.629 --> 1:04:02.380
with these animals

1:04:02.422 --> 1:04:03.632
my entire life.

1:04:03.674 --> 1:04:05.467
They are my family.

1:04:05.509 --> 1:04:07.010
They're our lifeblood.

1:04:08.136 --> 1:04:11.389
We do not hurt them for show.

1:04:11.431 --> 1:04:15.226
We don't zap them with

1:04:11.431 --> 1:04:15.226
those electric shock sticks.

1:04:15.268 --> 1:04:17.646
No, every bronco rider I know,

1:04:17.688 --> 1:04:19.189
he sits in that pen and he tries

1:04:19.230 --> 1:04:21.358
to calm that creature down.

1:04:21.399 --> 1:04:25.278
'Cause it's his life

1:04:21.399 --> 1:04:25.278
on the line out there.

1:04:25.320 --> 1:04:27.823
And those straps that

1:04:25.320 --> 1:04:27.823
irritate the underbelly

1:04:27.864 --> 1:04:29.199
of the animal?

1:04:29.240 --> 1:04:34.287
No, that's not how

1:04:29.240 --> 1:04:34.287
the rodeo works.

1:04:34.329 --> 1:04:38.041
Those straps are

1:04:34.329 --> 1:04:38.041
lined with fleece.

1:04:38.082 --> 1:04:39.584
All right, I want

1:04:38.082 --> 1:04:39.584
everyone to picture

1:04:39.626 --> 1:04:42.337
the softest sweater

1:04:39.626 --> 1:04:42.337
that you own.

1:04:42.379 --> 1:04:44.631
That's what's pressed

1:04:42.379 --> 1:04:44.631
up against their skin.

1:04:44.673 --> 1:04:47.384
These animals are

1:04:44.673 --> 1:04:47.384
trained athletes.

1:04:47.425 --> 1:04:49.427
Their job is to

1:04:47.425 --> 1:04:49.427
kick that strap off.

1:04:49.469 --> 1:04:50.762
That's why they buck.

1:04:50.804 --> 1:04:53.139
They know what their job is.

1:04:54.725 --> 1:04:56.142
And they are treated very well

1:04:56.184 --> 1:04:57.977
to be a part of the rodeo.

1:04:58.019 --> 1:05:00.438
You can ask any stock

1:04:58.019 --> 1:05:00.438
contractor around.

1:05:00.480 --> 1:05:01.523
The animals are

1:05:00.480 --> 1:05:01.523
way more important

1:05:01.565 --> 1:05:02.858
than any of us cowboys.

1:05:02.899 --> 1:05:05.902
- Yahoo!

1:05:02.899 --> 1:05:05.902
- Ain't that the truth.

1:05:05.943 --> 1:05:07.738
- They are well fed and

1:05:05.943 --> 1:05:07.738
attended to at all times.

1:05:07.779 --> 1:05:09.197
If there is a medical issue,

1:05:09.239 --> 1:05:10.907
it is handled quickly

1:05:09.239 --> 1:05:10.907
and efficiently.

1:05:10.948 --> 1:05:12.950
The rodeo is a celebration.

1:05:12.992 --> 1:05:14.619
It's a celebration of skills

1:05:14.661 --> 1:05:16.371
that we have to use

1:05:14.661 --> 1:05:16.371
every single day.

1:05:16.413 --> 1:05:17.955
These events were

1:05:16.413 --> 1:05:17.955
born out of ranches

1:05:17.997 --> 1:05:19.875
wanting to compete

1:05:17.997 --> 1:05:19.875
with other ranches

1:05:19.916 --> 1:05:21.334
to see who had the

1:05:19.916 --> 1:05:21.334
toughest cowboys

1:05:21.376 --> 1:05:23.587
and the most talented workers.

1:05:23.628 --> 1:05:25.129
We rope calves

1:05:23.628 --> 1:05:25.129
because we have to

1:05:25.171 --> 1:05:26.840
day in and day out.

1:05:26.882 --> 1:05:29.133
Look, if a calf gets

1:05:26.882 --> 1:05:29.133
sick, do you think

1:05:29.175 --> 1:05:32.053
he just lies down and lets

1:05:29.175 --> 1:05:32.053
the doctor work on him?

1:05:32.095 --> 1:05:34.598
No. No, we have to

1:05:32.095 --> 1:05:34.598
rope them and tie them

1:05:34.639 --> 1:05:36.892
and that's how

1:05:34.639 --> 1:05:36.892
our job gets done.

1:05:36.933 --> 1:05:39.060
And don't get me wrong,

1:05:36.933 --> 1:05:39.060
the rodeo has changed

1:05:39.102 --> 1:05:41.104
over the years.

1:05:41.145 --> 1:05:43.690
It's evolved, just

1:05:41.145 --> 1:05:43.690
as America has.

1:05:43.732 --> 1:05:45.066
It's not some throwback to

1:05:45.108 --> 1:05:46.484
"Little House on

1:05:45.108 --> 1:05:46.484
the Prairie Days."

1:05:46.526 --> 1:05:49.529
No, this is our

1:05:46.526 --> 1:05:49.529
real life every day.

1:05:49.571 --> 1:05:51.448
So, come celebrate with us.

1:05:51.489 --> 1:05:53.450
Come be a part of

1:05:51.489 --> 1:05:53.450
what made America

1:05:53.491 --> 1:05:55.034
the country that it is today.

1:05:55.076 --> 1:05:57.579
And yes, I understand

1:05:55.076 --> 1:05:57.579
it is entertainment,

1:05:57.621 --> 1:06:00.164
but it's born out of our lives.

1:06:02.542 --> 1:06:03.585
It's my life.

1:06:04.836 --> 1:06:06.170
I'm a cowboy.

1:06:08.965 --> 1:06:11.509
And I'm damn proud of it.

1:06:11.551 --> 1:06:13.887
And I really hope

1:06:11.551 --> 1:06:13.887
to see y'all there.

1:06:13.929 --> 1:06:15.555
- All right now.

1:06:15.597 --> 1:06:17.766
(applauding)

1:06:31.488 --> 1:06:35.199
- Thank you Colton for

1:06:31.488 --> 1:06:35.199
your impassioned words.

1:06:38.035 --> 1:06:41.372
You paint a very honorable

1:06:38.035 --> 1:06:41.372
picture of the rodeo

1:06:41.414 --> 1:06:43.583
and what it stands for.

1:06:43.625 --> 1:06:45.877
I hear what you say and yet

1:06:49.840 --> 1:06:52.884
what does the rodeo

1:06:49.840 --> 1:06:52.884
mean to the people

1:06:52.926 --> 1:06:55.219
outside of your experience?

1:06:57.722 --> 1:06:59.432
What do they get?

1:07:03.353 --> 1:07:06.105
Could something

1:07:03.353 --> 1:07:06.105
like this happen?

1:07:17.158 --> 1:07:20.161
This is what a rodeo

1:07:17.158 --> 1:07:20.161
looks like to people.

1:07:22.038 --> 1:07:24.374
You can talk all you want

1:07:22.038 --> 1:07:24.374
about your cowboy skills

1:07:24.415 --> 1:07:27.293
and your cowboy way of life.

1:07:27.335 --> 1:07:29.629
But when we hear the word rodeo,

1:07:29.671 --> 1:07:32.757
we picture animals

1:07:29.671 --> 1:07:32.757
being mistreated

1:07:35.010 --> 1:07:38.930
by people with no concern

1:07:35.010 --> 1:07:38.930
for their well-being.

1:07:41.892 --> 1:07:43.267
- Sir, would you

1:07:41.892 --> 1:07:43.267
please reconsider.

1:07:43.309 --> 1:07:44.394
- Cowboy!

1:07:48.690 --> 1:07:51.526
You said your

1:07:48.690 --> 1:07:51.526
piece, now sit down.

1:07:55.112 --> 1:07:56.447
- Time for the council to vote.

1:07:56.489 --> 1:07:57.407
Carl.

1:08:07.417 --> 1:08:10.795
With my vote, that

1:08:07.417 --> 1:08:10.795
makes it unanimous.

1:08:10.837 --> 1:08:13.464
There will be no

1:08:10.837 --> 1:08:13.464
rodeo in Potter Creek.

1:08:13.506 --> 1:08:15.341
Thank you everybody.

1:08:17.468 --> 1:08:20.013
- Thank you.

1:08:20.055 --> 1:08:22.057
- Thank you.

1:08:27.437 --> 1:08:30.815
- For those of you who

1:08:27.437 --> 1:08:30.815
were not in town today,

1:08:30.857 --> 1:08:34.235
who actually stayed

1:08:30.857 --> 1:08:34.235
here, did your jobs,

1:08:36.446 --> 1:08:39.115
first of all I want to say

1:08:36.446 --> 1:08:39.115
how much I appreciate that.

1:08:39.156 --> 1:08:41.993
Second of all, I

1:08:39.156 --> 1:08:41.993
want to tell you

1:08:42.035 --> 1:08:43.995
that the rumors are indeed true.

1:08:44.037 --> 1:08:46.664
Tomorrow's show

1:08:44.037 --> 1:08:46.664
has been canceled.

1:08:46.706 --> 1:08:48.249
- What?

1:08:46.706 --> 1:08:48.249
- Come on.

1:08:48.291 --> 1:08:50.001
- Yeah.

1:08:50.043 --> 1:08:53.212
And for those of you

1:08:50.043 --> 1:08:53.212
who were in town today

1:08:53.254 --> 1:08:56.173
at the meeting, I have

1:08:53.254 --> 1:08:56.173
half a mind to fire you

1:08:56.215 --> 1:08:59.594
on the spot, but I'm

1:08:56.215 --> 1:08:59.594
not gonna do that

1:09:02.513 --> 1:09:07.102
because you all have a whole

1:09:02.513 --> 1:09:07.102
helluva lot of work to do.

1:09:08.979 --> 1:09:11.022
Weather man tells

1:09:08.979 --> 1:09:11.022
me there is one

1:09:11.064 --> 1:09:12.899
hell of the storm

1:09:11.064 --> 1:09:12.899
coming our way,

1:09:12.941 --> 1:09:14.943
so batten down the hatches.

1:09:14.985 --> 1:09:16.444
Colton.

1:09:21.992 --> 1:09:23.660
I appreciate the

1:09:21.992 --> 1:09:23.660
hell out of what

1:09:23.701 --> 1:09:26.037
you tried to do up there today.

1:09:28.665 --> 1:09:29.833
That is a cowboy.

1:09:44.014 --> 1:09:45.264
- Right here.

1:09:45.306 --> 1:09:47.058
Vicious attack dog.

1:09:47.100 --> 1:09:49.936
Ooh, you like that,

1:09:47.100 --> 1:09:49.936
you're a Chopley,

1:09:49.978 --> 1:09:51.688
yeah, you think

1:09:49.978 --> 1:09:51.688
you can beat me? Yeah.

1:09:51.729 --> 1:09:55.399
- Careful, Dad, looks

1:09:51.729 --> 1:09:55.399
like animal abuse to me.

1:09:55.441 --> 1:09:58.736
You had no right to

1:09:55.441 --> 1:09:58.736
use that picture today.

1:10:02.573 --> 1:10:05.660
- I didn't take that

1:10:02.573 --> 1:10:05.660
picture, Tracy, you did.

1:10:05.702 --> 1:10:10.373
- That was before I knew

1:10:05.702 --> 1:10:10.373
about Colton or the rodeo.

1:10:10.414 --> 1:10:11.958
- Not every person in this town

1:10:12.000 --> 1:10:14.544
is gonna get to become

1:10:12.000 --> 1:10:14.544
friends with a cowboy.

1:10:14.585 --> 1:10:16.379
That picture you took represents

1:10:16.420 --> 1:10:20.008
a disrespect for animals that

1:10:16.420 --> 1:10:20.008
the rodeo brings with it.

1:10:20.050 --> 1:10:23.094
- So you just embarrassed

1:10:20.050 --> 1:10:23.094
me in front of everybody.

1:10:23.136 --> 1:10:25.262
- I did what I had to do.

1:10:25.304 --> 1:10:26.681
- [Tracy] At my expense.

1:10:26.723 --> 1:10:28.391
- You left me no choice.

1:10:28.432 --> 1:10:30.560
- Oh, Dad, no, you

1:10:28.432 --> 1:10:30.560
did have a choice.

1:10:30.601 --> 1:10:33.270
You chose your

1:10:30.601 --> 1:10:33.270
stupid cause over me!

1:10:33.312 --> 1:10:34.689
- Tracy.

1:10:34.731 --> 1:10:36.607
- No, save it, I

1:10:34.731 --> 1:10:36.607
don't wanna hear it.

1:10:36.649 --> 1:10:39.318
I have someone who deserves

1:10:36.649 --> 1:10:39.318
an apology from me.

1:10:39.360 --> 1:10:40.820
- You are not to go

1:10:39.360 --> 1:10:40.820
to those fairgrounds.

1:10:40.862 --> 1:10:42.989
- You left me no choice.

1:10:45.533 --> 1:10:48.578
(door slamming)

1:11:03.009 --> 1:11:05.386
(thundering)

1:11:14.938 --> 1:11:17.607
(siren blaring)

1:11:26.074 --> 1:11:27.324
- [Hank] Round up.

1:11:27.366 --> 1:11:28.451
Come on, get 'em over there.

1:11:28.492 --> 1:11:31.162
Come on, get to the

1:11:28.492 --> 1:11:31.162
back and hold 'em.

1:11:31.204 --> 1:11:32.496
Ooh, come on here.

1:11:42.882 --> 1:11:44.092
- Colton!

1:11:45.593 --> 1:11:46.594
Colton!

1:11:48.221 --> 1:11:49.513
Hey.

1:11:49.555 --> 1:11:51.849
Have you seen Colton?

1:11:49.555 --> 1:11:51.849
- Mm-mm.

1:11:53.726 --> 1:11:57.230
- [Woman] I'll put the

1:11:53.726 --> 1:11:57.230
rest of the saddles.

1:11:59.356 --> 1:12:00.233
- Colton.

1:12:01.901 --> 1:12:03.319
- Not a good time.

1:12:03.360 --> 1:12:04.570
- Colton, I'm sorry.

1:12:04.612 --> 1:12:07.198
- I'm busy, dammit.

1:12:07.240 --> 1:12:08.699
- Are you okay?

1:12:08.741 --> 1:12:09.784
- I'm not okay.

1:12:09.826 --> 1:12:11.577
Are you kiddin' me.

1:12:11.619 --> 1:12:12.870
Man, I thought I

1:12:11.619 --> 1:12:12.870
could handle anything

1:12:12.912 --> 1:12:14.580
they threw at me today.

1:12:14.622 --> 1:12:18.209
But you settin' me up,

1:12:14.622 --> 1:12:18.209
that was a low blow.

1:12:18.251 --> 1:12:20.920
You know nice work, lady lawyer.

1:12:22.172 --> 1:12:23.089
I never saw it comin'.

1:12:23.131 --> 1:12:24.841
- You have to understand,

1:12:24.882 --> 1:12:27.510
that picture was

1:12:24.882 --> 1:12:27.510
before I met you.

1:12:27.551 --> 1:12:29.262
- You made me look

1:12:27.551 --> 1:12:29.262
like an idiot.

1:12:29.304 --> 1:12:31.264
- But I didn't give it to him.

1:12:31.306 --> 1:12:33.474
I don't know, he must

1:12:31.306 --> 1:12:33.474
have found it somehow.

1:12:33.516 --> 1:12:35.893
I never even knew he had it.

1:12:35.935 --> 1:12:37.145
- Colton, come on.

1:12:37.187 --> 1:12:38.229
Help me secure the animals.

1:12:38.271 --> 1:12:40.106
The storm's comin' in.

1:12:53.870 --> 1:12:56.039
- [Hank] Up, up, bring

1:12:53.870 --> 1:12:56.039
'em up, come on now.

1:12:56.080 --> 1:12:57.456
- [Shawn] Make sure

1:12:56.080 --> 1:12:57.456
those are tied off.

1:12:57.498 --> 1:12:58.666
- Yeah, he's out of the pen.

1:12:58.708 --> 1:13:00.210
- Get around him.

1:13:00.251 --> 1:13:02.045
- [Hank] You got it.

1:13:00.251 --> 1:13:02.045
Come on. Come on now.

1:13:05.882 --> 1:13:07.884
Come on now, let's move.

1:13:10.136 --> 1:13:12.930
(thundering)

1:13:12.972 --> 1:13:15.766
(cow mooing)

1:13:15.808 --> 1:13:17.768
[Colton] Hank, that gate's open.

1:13:17.810 --> 1:13:19.270
- I'll go get him.

1:13:19.312 --> 1:13:20.646
- No, kid, wait.

1:13:20.688 --> 1:13:21.898
Colton, the kid.

1:13:21.939 --> 1:13:23.274
- Dammit!

1:13:29.113 --> 1:13:30.031
Hyah!

1:13:31.032 --> 1:13:31.949
Luke!

1:13:31.991 --> 1:13:34.160
- [Tracy] Colton, hurry.

1:13:35.578 --> 1:13:36.495
- Luke.

1:13:36.537 --> 1:13:39.374
- Colton's after him.

1:13:39.415 --> 1:13:41.084
- [Robert] Luke!

1:13:41.125 --> 1:13:43.961
(dramatic music)

1:13:44.003 --> 1:13:46.339
- Hey, come back!

1:13:44.003 --> 1:13:46.339
Come back!

1:13:55.306 --> 1:13:57.767
Wait! Aah!

1:13:57.808 --> 1:13:59.894
- Luke, where are you?

1:14:02.021 --> 1:14:02.855
- [Luke] Someone help!

1:14:02.897 --> 1:14:04.607
- [Colton] Luke!

1:14:04.648 --> 1:14:05.566
- Help, help!

1:14:09.570 --> 1:14:10.529
Help!

1:14:12.698 --> 1:14:14.533
- I'm comin' for you buddy.

1:14:14.575 --> 1:14:15.826
Just hang on, I got you.

1:14:15.868 --> 1:14:16.827
- Help!

1:14:19.205 --> 1:14:20.415
- Luke!

1:14:21.457 --> 1:14:23.584
- Grab the rope Luke.

1:14:23.626 --> 1:14:24.835
- Oh, my God.

1:14:34.971 --> 1:14:36.680
- Luke!

1:14:38.766 --> 1:14:40.476
- Are you okay?

1:14:40.517 --> 1:14:42.228
- (coughing)

1:14:42.270 --> 1:14:45.064
- Hey, hey, hey, are you hurt?

1:14:45.106 --> 1:14:46.607
You okay?

1:14:45.106 --> 1:14:46.607
- I'm okay.

1:14:46.649 --> 1:14:48.025
- Luke!

1:14:46.649 --> 1:14:48.025
- Dad.

1:14:48.067 --> 1:14:49.444
- Are you okay?

1:14:48.067 --> 1:14:49.444
- I'm so sorry, Dad.

1:14:49.485 --> 1:14:50.945
- Are you okay?

1:14:49.485 --> 1:14:50.945
Look at me.

1:14:52.405 --> 1:14:53.364
- Tracy.

1:14:53.406 --> 1:14:54.782
- Oh, Colton.

1:14:56.742 --> 1:14:59.120
- Don't you ever do

1:14:56.742 --> 1:14:59.120
that to me again.

1:14:59.162 --> 1:15:01.998
Oh, my God.

1:15:12.549 --> 1:15:17.138
- I don't know what we

1:15:12.549 --> 1:15:17.138
would have done without you.

1:15:17.180 --> 1:15:20.475
- I think he's

1:15:17.180 --> 1:15:20.475
gonna be just fine.

1:15:20.516 --> 1:15:22.226
It's what we do here.

1:15:25.062 --> 1:15:27.064
- Hey, sweetheart.

1:15:27.106 --> 1:15:29.817
Can you give Colton

1:15:27.106 --> 1:15:29.817
and I a minute?

1:15:29.859 --> 1:15:31.110
- Be nice.

1:15:36.491 --> 1:15:38.451
- You saved my boy.

1:15:38.493 --> 1:15:40.495
- Trigger and I did, sir.

1:15:40.536 --> 1:15:43.289
- I guess that's some real

1:15:40.536 --> 1:15:43.289
cowboy skills in action.

1:15:43.331 --> 1:15:45.208
- That's what I was trying

1:15:43.331 --> 1:15:45.208
to say at the meeting, sir.

1:15:45.249 --> 1:15:46.583
It's what we do.

1:15:49.045 --> 1:15:51.214
- How about you show

1:15:49.045 --> 1:15:51.214
me around this place.

1:15:51.255 --> 1:15:54.300
I promise to keep an open

1:15:51.255 --> 1:15:54.300
mind about your rodeo.

1:15:54.342 --> 1:15:56.927
- Be my pleasure.

1:15:56.969 --> 1:15:59.514
(horse whinnying)

1:16:00.806 --> 1:16:03.309
You know, it would

1:16:00.806 --> 1:16:03.309
only take one person

1:16:03.351 --> 1:16:05.728
to change their vote.

1:16:05.769 --> 1:16:07.104
- Is that right.

1:16:10.774 --> 1:16:13.444
Yes, I know what I said Carl.

1:16:13.486 --> 1:16:14.945
But I witnessed what they do

1:16:14.987 --> 1:16:16.406
with my own eyes.

1:16:17.656 --> 1:16:19.658
I was wrong about them.

1:16:27.375 --> 1:16:28.292
- Well?

1:16:29.668 --> 1:16:30.794
What do you think?

1:16:32.296 --> 1:16:34.924
- I think you're

1:16:32.296 --> 1:16:34.924
an amazing woman.

1:16:37.218 --> 1:16:39.636
- Thanks, Daddy.

1:16:39.678 --> 1:16:41.764
- I learned something today.

1:16:41.805 --> 1:16:43.391
I learned that you're old enough

1:16:43.433 --> 1:16:47.353
to teach me a few new

1:16:43.433 --> 1:16:47.353
things about the world.

1:16:47.395 --> 1:16:51.441
- Now, where do you think

1:16:47.395 --> 1:16:51.441
I learned that from?

1:16:51.482 --> 1:16:53.067
- Probably your mother.

1:16:54.318 --> 1:16:55.194
- Probably.

1:17:01.951 --> 1:17:03.786
Where did you get it?

1:17:04.870 --> 1:17:08.040
- I know a few cowboys

1:17:04.870 --> 1:17:08.040
down at the rodeo.

1:17:09.292 --> 1:17:10.709
What do you think?

1:17:11.502 --> 1:17:13.045
- I couldn't think

1:17:11.502 --> 1:17:13.045
of a better way

1:17:13.087 --> 1:17:14.671
to complete this outfit.

1:17:14.713 --> 1:17:16.132
- That's my girl.

1:17:19.802 --> 1:17:21.637
- Always and forever.

1:17:26.892 --> 1:17:29.437
(bright music)

1:18:32.583 --> 1:18:34.751
- [Announcer] Next

1:18:32.583 --> 1:18:34.751
up is the current

1:18:34.793 --> 1:18:36.504
first place rider

1:18:34.793 --> 1:18:36.504
in the ropin' event.

1:18:36.546 --> 1:18:37.921
Colton Burtenshaw.

1:18:37.963 --> 1:18:41.342
(applauding and cheering)

1:18:44.470 --> 1:18:47.515
(cow mooing)

1:18:47.557 --> 1:18:49.684
- [Man] Rider, you ready?

1:18:51.852 --> 1:18:53.854
- [Announcer] And he's out.

1:18:59.818 --> 1:19:01.778
And that's a solid throw.

1:19:08.661 --> 1:19:12.707
Look at that, it's gonna

1:19:08.661 --> 1:19:12.707
be done absolutely perfect.

1:19:12.748 --> 1:19:14.625
- Whoa, he is good.

1:19:14.667 --> 1:19:16.335
- Yeah, I knew he would be.

1:19:16.377 --> 1:19:18.921
- [Announcer] Colton

1:19:16.377 --> 1:19:18.921
Burtenshaw takes first place.

1:19:29.223 --> 1:19:31.058
Well, it's been an

1:19:29.223 --> 1:19:31.058
exciting day folks.

1:19:31.100 --> 1:19:35.396
Ladies and gentlemen, it's

1:19:31.100 --> 1:19:35.396
time for the main event.

1:19:38.023 --> 1:19:40.025
Now the PBR is here tonight

1:19:40.067 --> 1:19:43.862
and with a clean ride, our

1:19:40.067 --> 1:19:43.862
very own Vince Lockwood

1:19:43.904 --> 1:19:47.908
has a shot to get into

1:19:43.904 --> 1:19:47.908
the PBR Premier Steering.

1:19:54.749 --> 1:19:57.418
- Hey, give 'em a good

1:19:54.749 --> 1:19:57.418
show will you Vince.

1:19:57.460 --> 1:19:59.670
- You not scared your

1:19:57.460 --> 1:19:59.670
girl might fall for me?

1:19:59.712 --> 1:20:01.922
- Nah, I don't think

1:19:59.712 --> 1:20:01.922
she likes volunteering

1:20:01.964 --> 1:20:02.757
at the old folks home.

1:20:02.798 --> 1:20:03.716
- Ooh.

1:20:05.426 --> 1:20:07.886
Thanks for what you do, Colton.

1:20:07.928 --> 1:20:09.764
I wouldn't be here without you.

1:20:09.805 --> 1:20:11.557
I mean that.

1:20:11.599 --> 1:20:14.769
- You would have

1:20:11.599 --> 1:20:14.769
done the same, right.

1:20:15.770 --> 1:20:17.020
- All right.

1:20:22.943 --> 1:20:24.278
- Give 'em hell Vince.

1:20:25.571 --> 1:20:26.947
- He missed us,

1:20:25.571 --> 1:20:26.947
but I know he can.

1:20:26.989 --> 1:20:29.366
He'll be back to the big time.

1:20:34.664 --> 1:20:37.708
Everything comes

1:20:34.664 --> 1:20:37.708
down to this ride.

1:20:37.750 --> 1:20:39.460
You can do it cowboy.

1:21:04.985 --> 1:21:07.822
- This is Vince, he's the best.

1:21:11.826 --> 1:21:14.244
- That's it Vince.

1:21:14.286 --> 1:21:15.287
It's your time buddy.

1:21:15.329 --> 1:21:16.831
It's your time.

1:21:22.336 --> 1:21:23.337
Go, go, go, go.

1:21:28.300 --> 1:21:29.468
Stay on.

1:21:29.510 --> 1:21:30.845
Hold it, hold it!

1:21:33.055 --> 1:21:33.972
Yeah!

1:21:34.014 --> 1:21:34.931
Come on!

1:21:37.434 --> 1:21:39.603
(buzzing)

1:21:41.938 --> 1:21:44.149
- [Announcer] Ooh, that's

1:21:41.938 --> 1:21:44.149
an official ride, folks.

1:21:44.191 --> 1:21:45.275
Eight seconds.

1:21:45.317 --> 1:21:47.611
- Yes!

1:21:45.317 --> 1:21:47.611
- [Announcer] Bleed dry.

1:21:47.653 --> 1:21:50.239
You have done it cowboy.

1:21:47.653 --> 1:21:50.239
- Whoo!

1:21:54.869 --> 1:21:56.119
- I saw him practicing.

1:21:56.161 --> 1:21:57.996
I knew he could do it.

1:21:59.540 --> 1:22:00.457
- Yeah!

1:22:08.340 --> 1:22:10.760
- Thank you, sir, I

1:22:08.340 --> 1:22:10.760
sure do appreciate it.

1:22:10.801 --> 1:22:11.719
- Good luck.

1:22:14.513 --> 1:22:16.557
- Was that who I think it is?

1:22:16.599 --> 1:22:19.351
- I just got my first

1:22:16.599 --> 1:22:19.351
big dog sponsor.

1:22:19.393 --> 1:22:21.604
I guess my boss Shawn put

1:22:19.393 --> 1:22:21.604
in a good word for me.

1:22:21.645 --> 1:22:23.063
- He knows talent

1:22:21.645 --> 1:22:23.063
when he sees it.

1:22:23.105 --> 1:22:24.106
- You were awesome.

1:22:24.147 --> 1:22:25.775
- Thanks, buddy.

1:22:26.734 --> 1:22:28.611
- It was a great show.

1:22:28.652 --> 1:22:30.070
- Thank you so much, sir.

1:22:30.112 --> 1:22:31.530
It means the world

1:22:30.112 --> 1:22:31.530
that y'all came out.

1:22:31.572 --> 1:22:33.282
- Yeah, we wouldn't

1:22:31.572 --> 1:22:33.282
have missed it.

1:22:34.450 --> 1:22:37.119
- You know, there's

1:22:34.450 --> 1:22:37.119
a barn dance after.

1:22:37.160 --> 1:22:40.539
I would love if y'all

1:22:37.160 --> 1:22:40.539
could come out to that.

1:22:40.581 --> 1:22:41.665
Y'all ready for this?

1:22:41.707 --> 1:22:42.583
- Yes.

1:22:44.418 --> 1:22:46.921
- Well, not your average barn.

1:23:58.283 --> 1:24:02.162

1:23:58.283 --> 1:24:02.162
with me all these years.

1:24:02.204 --> 1:24:04.581

1:24:02.204 --> 1:24:04.581
the insurance money.

1:24:04.623 --> 1:24:07.501

1:24:16.134 --> 1:24:18.721
- So what do you think?

1:24:18.762 --> 1:24:21.765
- Well, I definitely need

1:24:18.762 --> 1:24:21.765
to step up my two step.

1:24:21.807 --> 1:24:25.435
- No, I mean about the

1:24:21.807 --> 1:24:25.435
rodeo and the dance.

1:24:27.813 --> 1:24:31.525

1:24:27.813 --> 1:24:31.525

1:24:39.324 --> 1:24:40.492

1:24:42.870 --> 1:24:44.454
You leave tomorrow.

1:24:45.330 --> 1:24:46.206
- Yeah.

1:24:47.708 --> 1:24:49.125
Yeah, this is it.

1:24:50.669 --> 1:24:53.047

go off to Santa Cruz.

1:25:02.556 --> 1:25:04.641
- Yeah, you're right.

1:25:04.683 --> 1:25:06.518
It probably wouldn't work.

1:25:08.854 --> 1:25:09.813
- Right.

1:25:12.107 --> 1:25:14.068
Goodbyes are always hard.

But there's a good way to do it

1:25:17.195 --> 1:25:19.656
and there's a bad way to do it.

1:25:22.034 --> 1:25:23.786
- So what's the good way?
