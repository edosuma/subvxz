WEBVTT

00:42.600 --> 00:43.800
That was awesome.

00:43.867 --> 00:45.767
You are definitely
Ricky Cooper's kid.

00:45.833 --> 00:47.233
Eh, wasn't my finest moment.

00:47.300 --> 00:48.300
I've done better.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.200
Darn.

00:51.267 --> 00:53.233
Oh, here.

00:53.300 --> 00:55.233
You can have some of mine.

00:56.333 --> 00:57.433
I'll survive.

00:59.400 --> 01:01.400
You live on Oak, right?

01:03.067 --> 01:05.067
I could, like,
walk with you maybe,

01:05.100 --> 01:06.367
while you ride.

01:07.867 --> 01:11.433
Uh, I'd love to get
some tips on my swing.

01:11.500 --> 01:13.300
Your stance
could use some work.

01:18.700 --> 01:19.867
Thanks.

01:28.067 --> 01:29.800
Thanks for walking me home.

01:29.867 --> 01:31.567
No, thank you for the tips.

01:31.633 --> 01:32.800
I can't believe

01:32.867 --> 01:33.967
that's your fourth home run
this season.

01:34.067 --> 01:35.700
You're showing up
a lot of guys on my team.

01:35.767 --> 01:38.067
Pretty sure
I'd show them all up.

01:39.200 --> 01:41.267
Maybe we could
work on our swings...

01:41.333 --> 01:42.367
together?

01:43.633 --> 01:45.433
Yeah, okay.

01:45.500 --> 01:46.933
Sure, that'd be great.

01:51.600 --> 01:54.700
Well, see ya at school.

01:55.967 --> 01:56.867
Okay, bye.

02:03.767 --> 02:05.533
He likes you.

02:33.133 --> 02:36.833
He doesn't like you.

02:36.900 --> 02:38.467
It's not
gonna happen, Cooper.

02:38.533 --> 02:39.667
Not ever.

02:39.733 --> 02:41.933
What are you talking about?

02:42.067 --> 02:43.333
Austin?

02:43.400 --> 02:45.633
Hello...!

02:45.700 --> 02:47.700
Stay away from him.

02:47.767 --> 02:49.067
I'm not playing.

02:50.667 --> 02:52.967
She's not playing.

02:53.067 --> 02:55.633
Not one bit.

03:04.833 --> 03:06.367
Hey, uh, Steph,
you got a minute?

03:06.433 --> 03:07.500
Uh, not likely.

03:07.567 --> 03:09.067
The website is down again.

03:09.133 --> 03:10.767
Yeah, well,
I'm kind of swamped, Boss.

03:10.833 --> 03:12.467
Can you give me
a second, or ten,

03:12.533 --> 03:13.567
or maybe come back next week?

03:15.200 --> 03:18.267
Hey, can I get one of your
Stephanie Specials, please?

03:18.333 --> 03:19.400
Alan, it's not
a good time.

03:19.467 --> 03:20.633
I'll take a number five.

03:20.700 --> 03:22.800
Can you make that
gluten-free?

03:22.867 --> 03:23.900
Also, I'm allergic to nuts,

03:23.967 --> 03:25.300
except for almonds
and cashews,

03:25.367 --> 03:26.100
so can you replace
the pine nuts and the walnuts?

03:26.167 --> 03:26.900
I'd love a little ice,

03:26.967 --> 03:28.967
a touch of cinnamon,

03:29.067 --> 03:30.233
and blend that up with some
almond milk if you could,

03:30.300 --> 03:32.233
because I'm also lactose
and soy intolerant.

03:32.300 --> 03:33.600
You're none
of those things, Alan.

03:33.667 --> 03:35.067
Well, no, I think
I might be, though.

03:35.067 --> 03:36.767
I haven't been
feeling great lately,

03:36.833 --> 03:37.867
so I'm gonna do
one of those no-gluten,

03:37.933 --> 03:40.433
no-soy, no-lactose,

03:40.500 --> 03:42.167
pretend-I-live-in-L.A. diets.

03:42.233 --> 03:43.667
Later on today,
I'm gonna see a Shaman.

03:43.733 --> 03:45.733
Look, ever since
we added the option

03:45.800 --> 03:46.600
to sign up
for classes online,

03:46.667 --> 03:47.700
the site keeps crashing.

03:47.767 --> 03:49.433
There's a lot of traffic,
I guess.

03:49.500 --> 03:50.500
Definitely.

03:50.567 --> 03:51.767
Well, that's a good thing

03:51.833 --> 03:53.833
People are signing up
for classes! Boom!

03:53.900 --> 03:55.733
Yeah, but Steph, we can't
leave our members hanging,

03:55.800 --> 03:57.867
and you are the gym's
official website designer.

03:57.933 --> 04:00.467
Yeah, I'm also the gym's
official personal trainer,

04:00.533 --> 04:01.667
yoga instructor,

04:01.733 --> 04:02.600
juice blender,

04:02.667 --> 04:03.800
and, officially

04:03.867 --> 04:06.067
trying not to fail
out of grad school.

04:07.233 --> 04:09.567
Wow, that's a lot.

04:09.633 --> 04:11.133
Well, you're doing
a bang-up job, Stephanie.

04:11.200 --> 04:12.900
We all really appreciate
what you do.

04:12.967 --> 04:16.133
Thank you, Alan.

04:16.200 --> 04:17.600
No, uh, agreed.

04:17.667 --> 04:19.667
Thank you, Steph.

04:19.733 --> 04:21.933
You know, it's all about
time management.

04:22.067 --> 04:24.833
You need some sort of
organizational system.

04:24.900 --> 04:26.533
Like, how do you keep track
of what's work

04:26.600 --> 04:27.267
and what's school?

04:27.333 --> 04:28.533
I just do.

04:28.600 --> 04:29.800
I have a system,

04:29.867 --> 04:32.233
and don't try to lecture me
on life balance.

04:32.300 --> 04:33.933
No, no, I wasn't going to.

04:34.067 --> 04:35.433
I will.
Just for a second.

04:35.500 --> 04:37.967
I think some mindful meditation
would be the way to go.

04:38.067 --> 04:39.367
Yeah?

04:39.433 --> 04:41.233
Should I meditate before
or after I make your juice?

04:41.300 --> 04:43.500
He's just trying to help.

04:43.567 --> 04:44.433
He is.

04:44.500 --> 04:46.100
I am!

04:46.167 --> 04:47.667
I think you should be
focused and present, Stephanie.

04:47.733 --> 04:49.700
Yeah? And I think
that you should leave.

04:49.767 --> 04:50.967
Fine.

04:51.067 --> 04:52.767
Don't be mindful,
don't be present,

04:52.833 --> 04:53.867
see if I give a care.

04:53.933 --> 04:55.167
I'll come back for my juice.

04:55.233 --> 04:56.967
Okay.

04:58.233 --> 04:59.667
Would you just
look at the website?

05:00.667 --> 05:02.267
Oh, okay,
maybe not.

05:02.333 --> 05:03.200
But you know,
why don't I...

05:03.267 --> 05:05.900
I'll make Alan's drink.

05:05.967 --> 05:07.833
Yeah. Great idea.

05:11.667 --> 05:13.600
O-M-G!

05:13.667 --> 05:14.767
It finally happened.

05:14.833 --> 05:16.333
You're amazeballs!

05:21.900 --> 05:23.933
You're interrupting
my finance homework.

05:24.067 --> 05:25.067
I'm reading about Wall Street,

05:25.100 --> 05:26.933
and what is going on in here?

05:27.067 --> 05:31.067
We just reached
100,000 followers!

05:31.100 --> 05:32.733
Well, I did,

05:32.800 --> 05:33.867
with my account.

05:33.933 --> 05:35.967
Why would anyone
want to follow you?

05:36.067 --> 05:38.633
Um, because she slays?

05:38.700 --> 05:40.100
Yeah, and my health
and beauty tips

05:40.167 --> 05:41.900
are, like,
super popular right now.

05:41.967 --> 05:44.067
Sometimes...

05:44.133 --> 05:45.600
they even give us
free stuff.

05:45.667 --> 05:47.600
And we have more offers.

05:47.667 --> 05:49.800
I think there's even
a fragrance thing going on--

05:49.867 --> 05:51.267
I hear you.

05:51.333 --> 05:53.100
Now, show me
that profile, Mirabel.

05:53.167 --> 05:54.167
Now you've got my attention.

05:54.233 --> 05:55.633
Why?

05:55.700 --> 05:57.633
Because capitalism
works like this--

05:57.700 --> 05:59.900
supply and demand.

06:00.067 --> 06:01.233
People are demanding

06:01.300 --> 06:03.200
that they're going to pay
for you to supply.

06:03.267 --> 06:04.733
Now let me see that profile.

06:15.167 --> 06:17.067
What are you doing, Gigi?

06:17.133 --> 06:19.667
I'm figuring out
how to best benefit

06:19.733 --> 06:20.933
from all this Insta-fame.

06:21.067 --> 06:23.067
You're eight years old.

06:23.067 --> 06:24.100
Only in years, Liam.

06:24.167 --> 06:25.600
Somewhere in there

06:25.667 --> 06:26.700
there's a little C.E.O.

06:26.767 --> 06:29.900
just waiting to come out.

06:44.067 --> 06:45.067
Gigi?

06:45.133 --> 06:46.300
Sorry.

06:46.367 --> 06:47.400
We just need to keep
producing content,

06:47.467 --> 06:48.667
or you'll lose your followers.

06:49.367 --> 06:51.867
And why are we so interested
all of a sudden?

06:51.933 --> 06:53.400
Because the more content
you produce,

06:53.467 --> 06:54.867
the more followers you get,

06:54.933 --> 06:56.767
the more sponsors you get.

06:56.833 --> 06:58.733
Do you follow me?

06:58.800 --> 07:00.800
I've always wanted fans,

07:00.867 --> 07:02.367
but I've never thought
about a sponsor.

07:02.433 --> 07:04.367
And that's why
you need a manager.

07:04.433 --> 07:06.233
Whoa, whoa, wait, a manager?

07:08.800 --> 07:11.067
Mirabel,
I crunched the numbers,

07:11.133 --> 07:13.067
and we can make
some serious cash.

07:13.067 --> 07:15.067
You know, Dad's gonna flip

07:15.133 --> 07:16.333
if he finds out
that we're wheeling and dealing

07:16.400 --> 07:17.333
on the Internet.

07:18.533 --> 07:19.933
'Tis better to ask
for forgiveness

07:20.067 --> 07:21.133
than permission.

07:21.200 --> 07:22.800
I won't tell if you won't.

07:26.267 --> 07:27.233
Deal.

07:29.067 --> 07:31.100
Oh, and here's
your new schedule.

07:31.167 --> 07:32.233
We'll be filming
the whole way through.

07:36.967 --> 07:40.833
Uh, 6:00 a.m. workout video?

07:40.900 --> 07:44.333
7:00 a.m. makeup tutorial...

07:44.400 --> 07:45.967
8:00 a.m. spray tan?

07:46.067 --> 07:48.067
Welcome to your new life.

07:57.467 --> 07:58.733
I'm telling you,

07:58.800 --> 08:00.067
she's pathetic,

08:00.067 --> 08:01.500
and her wardrobe?

08:01.567 --> 08:03.167
I mean, yuck.

08:03.233 --> 08:05.333
Yuck, definitely yuck.

08:05.400 --> 08:07.333
I don't even understand
how she and her older sister

08:07.400 --> 08:08.800
could even be related.

08:08.867 --> 08:10.300
Totes!

08:10.367 --> 08:13.067
I mean, Mirabel's
actually pretty,

08:13.067 --> 08:15.300
and cool,
like, untouchable.

08:15.367 --> 08:16.467
Yeah.

08:16.533 --> 08:18.267
Why Austin
likes Elisa,

08:18.333 --> 08:19.500
a mystery.

08:19.567 --> 08:21.367
He does not like her!

08:21.433 --> 08:23.067
Of course,
he doesn't like her.

08:23.133 --> 08:24.767
And why would he?

08:24.833 --> 08:27.133
She smells like gym socks!

08:27.200 --> 08:28.367
Yeah--

08:28.433 --> 08:30.133
Wait, worse.

08:30.200 --> 08:32.100
Way worse.

08:32.167 --> 08:34.067
Like a jockstrap!

08:36.400 --> 08:38.167
Boom.

08:38.233 --> 08:40.300
Jockstrap it is.

08:54.400 --> 08:55.467
Steph!

08:55.533 --> 08:56.467
Yes, Alan?

08:56.533 --> 08:57.967
Can I talk to you
for a second?

08:58.067 --> 09:00.200
I'm in the middle of a paper
that's due in an hour,

09:00.267 --> 09:01.433
and I am in the zone.

09:01.500 --> 09:03.067
Right, that's what
I'm here to talk about.

09:03.067 --> 09:04.233
Your silver sneakers
work-out class

09:04.300 --> 09:05.867
starts in five minutes,

09:05.933 --> 09:07.267
and those seniors are ready for
a little Olivia Neutron Bomb,

09:07.333 --> 09:08.267
you know what I'm saying?

09:08.333 --> 09:10.200
Crap.

09:10.267 --> 09:12.133
I-I totally forgot.

09:12.200 --> 09:14.533
I can't do it,
I have to finish this!

09:14.600 --> 09:15.933
No, right,
that's what I'm saying.

09:16.067 --> 09:17.567
I'm going to teach
the class for you.

09:17.633 --> 09:19.600
I'm gonna do it.

09:24.400 --> 09:26.800
Those seniors
gonna work their bodies.

09:26.867 --> 09:28.233
For you. Wah!

09:28.300 --> 09:29.400
Right?

09:29.467 --> 09:31.500
Ha, ha, ha! Work it!

09:31.567 --> 09:33.567
Let's go, people.
Physical! let's do this!

09:44.733 --> 09:45.700
Let's go, let's go.

09:45.767 --> 09:48.267
Come on, it's time
to get to class.

09:48.333 --> 09:49.333
Put away
any cell phones.

09:49.400 --> 09:51.233
If I see them,
they are mine.

09:53.400 --> 09:55.067
You guys get to class.

10:00.233 --> 10:01.967
At East End Elementary,

10:02.033 --> 10:05.367
we take bullying
very seriously,

10:05.433 --> 10:07.333
and while it upsets me,

10:07.400 --> 10:09.300
mainly, I'm disappointed

10:09.367 --> 10:13.533
at just how unkind
my students can be.

10:13.600 --> 10:18.033
This truly is
the worst form of behavior.

10:18.100 --> 10:22.500
The bullying needs to stop
right now,

10:22.567 --> 10:25.100
and since no one has volunteered
to come forward

10:25.167 --> 10:30.333
and tell me who vandalized
the sixth-grade locker,

10:30.400 --> 10:32.200
you can write down
who you think did it

10:32.267 --> 10:33.933
anonymously.

10:40.133 --> 10:41.300
This is a very sad day.

10:45.133 --> 10:47.300
Come on...

10:47.367 --> 10:50.267
you know how
to be better people.

10:58.533 --> 11:00.300
We give you her image,

11:00.367 --> 11:02.333
non-exclusively, naturally,

11:02.400 --> 11:05.567
and your lip gloss is seen
by 100,000 teenagers

11:05.633 --> 11:07.200
with buying power,

11:07.267 --> 11:09.433
and probably their parents'
credit cards.

11:09.500 --> 11:10.467
That's right.

11:10.533 --> 11:12.067
Think about it.

11:12.067 --> 11:13.567
You have until
end of business tomorrow.

11:13.633 --> 11:14.667
Good day.

11:20.133 --> 11:21.500
I got your text.

11:21.567 --> 11:23.433
You wanted to see me?

11:23.500 --> 11:24.667
Yes, please.

11:24.733 --> 11:26.233
I want to talk about
your part in the company.

11:27.533 --> 11:29.400
Gigi, Mirabel and I
are doing homework.

11:29.467 --> 11:31.100
I don't have time.

11:31.167 --> 11:32.267
Big mistake.

11:35.967 --> 11:38.267
Big mistake...

11:48.900 --> 11:50.900
What a shame.

11:54.400 --> 11:56.267
There's my favorite
web designer.

11:56.333 --> 11:58.367
I'm your only web designer.

11:58.433 --> 11:59.400
And a fantastic one.

11:59.467 --> 12:00.467
Do you mind?

12:00.533 --> 12:01.567
I don't have time to chit chat.

12:01.633 --> 12:02.533
Yeah, I thought
you'd say that,

12:02.600 --> 12:04.600
so...

12:08.733 --> 12:11.333
It's for your papers,
your laptop,

12:11.400 --> 12:12.300
your tablet,

12:12.367 --> 12:13.667
and your very messy life.

12:15.233 --> 12:16.533
I love it, thank you.

12:16.600 --> 12:17.500
Thank you,

12:17.567 --> 12:19.200
for keeping this place running.

12:19.267 --> 12:20.600
You do a lot,

12:20.667 --> 12:21.967
and it's pathetic
you had to remind me

12:22.067 --> 12:23.600
in order for me to notice.

12:23.667 --> 12:24.633
You're the best.

12:24.700 --> 12:26.400
I couldn't do it
without you.

12:28.567 --> 12:29.533
Whoa!

12:29.600 --> 12:30.500
Presents?

12:30.567 --> 12:31.600
None for you.

12:31.667 --> 12:32.700
I thought
I was your favorite.

12:32.767 --> 12:34.967
No, no, you've
never been my favorite.

12:35.067 --> 12:36.067
I'm his favorite.

12:37.233 --> 12:38.600
Oh, okay.

12:38.667 --> 12:41.100
Okay, okay,
I'll get you a present.

12:42.367 --> 12:43.600
What do you want?

12:43.667 --> 12:45.067
A new Pacebit?

12:45.133 --> 12:46.533
Yes!

12:46.600 --> 12:47.733
Please?

12:47.800 --> 12:48.900
The one with
the bigger face.

12:48.967 --> 12:50.267
I'll email you the link.

12:50.333 --> 12:51.367
You got it.

12:51.433 --> 12:53.133
Alan, thank you for earlier.

12:53.200 --> 12:54.567
You really saved my life.

12:55.767 --> 12:56.900
That's all right,
that's what I do,

12:56.967 --> 12:58.633
I save lives, it's cool.

12:59.567 --> 13:01.100
Johnny, watch it!

13:28.100 --> 13:28.700
What the...

13:34.767 --> 13:38.433
What happened
to all my friends?

13:47.700 --> 13:50.333
Hey, Austin.

13:50.400 --> 13:51.333
Oh, hey...

13:51.400 --> 13:53.100
Hi.

13:53.167 --> 13:55.167
What's up?

13:55.233 --> 13:58.200
I thought maybe
we could work on our hitting?

13:58.267 --> 14:00.567
Why would he want to do that?

14:00.633 --> 14:03.467
It's not like
you're friends or anything.

14:03.533 --> 14:05.433
In fact,

14:05.500 --> 14:08.567
you're not friends
with anyone, are you?

14:10.467 --> 14:13.333
See ya around, jockstrap.

14:33.633 --> 14:35.633
Has anyone seen Elisa?

14:49.600 --> 14:51.800
Elisa, honey,
are you in here?

14:53.267 --> 14:55.133
Just a minute!

15:01.700 --> 15:03.433
Okay,

15:03.500 --> 15:05.233
you and I both have had enough.

15:05.300 --> 15:07.433
Do you want
to wash your face?

15:07.500 --> 15:08.733
I'm okay.

15:08.800 --> 15:11.833
Okay.

15:11.900 --> 15:14.667
It's okay, sweetie,
I'm here with you, okay?

15:14.733 --> 15:16.500
You just take
all the time you need.

15:22.967 --> 15:24.267
I was thinking,

15:24.333 --> 15:26.200
now that the girls
don't need me so much,

15:26.267 --> 15:29.200
I think it's time for me
to get back in the game.

15:29.267 --> 15:30.267
Wait...

15:31.933 --> 15:34.300
Wait, you have a degree
in Psychology?

15:35.600 --> 15:37.067
Well, I really wanted
to pursue that,

15:37.133 --> 15:40.433
but then I met my first husband,
and you know how that goes,

15:40.500 --> 15:42.200
but I'm open to suggestions.

15:45.400 --> 15:47.367
Oh, it's Elisa's school.

15:47.433 --> 15:49.333
Hello.

15:49.400 --> 15:51.900
Oh, uh, Principal Reed.

15:54.867 --> 15:56.333
All right.

15:56.400 --> 15:58.200
No problem,
I'll be right there.

15:58.267 --> 16:01.367
Elisa's being bullied.
I gotta go.

16:01.433 --> 16:03.867
Oh! I'm coming.

16:05.367 --> 16:06.833
I'm so sorry,

16:06.900 --> 16:09.700
I don't know what has
gotten into Lucy lately.

16:09.767 --> 16:12.967
My daughter
is out there crying,

16:13.067 --> 16:15.533
having her self-esteem
ripped apart,

16:15.600 --> 16:17.633
and there's no concrete action
being taken

16:17.700 --> 16:19.467
to ensure
it never happens again.

16:19.533 --> 16:21.367
Let's call Lucy in

16:21.433 --> 16:22.900
and see if we can get
to the bottom of it.

16:22.967 --> 16:24.500
Let's do that.

16:32.367 --> 16:33.367
Lucy?

16:33.433 --> 16:34.567
We'd like to see you.

16:34.633 --> 16:36.400
Come on.

16:42.067 --> 16:44.800
Whatever I'm being accused of,
I didn't do it.

16:44.867 --> 16:46.067
We'll see about that.

16:46.133 --> 16:48.367
What are you,
the parent police?

16:48.433 --> 16:49.333
Lucy!

16:49.400 --> 16:50.433
Just sayin',

16:50.500 --> 16:53.233
innocent until proven guilty.

16:53.300 --> 16:54.733
Aw, cut the act, sweetheart.

16:54.800 --> 16:57.567
You think I don't know
girls like you?

16:57.633 --> 17:00.467
Honey, I was a girl
just like you.

17:00.533 --> 17:03.067
The first time I was
in the Principal's Office,

17:03.067 --> 17:04.633
I cut a girl's ponytail off.

17:05.767 --> 17:06.967
I just couldn't stop myself,

17:07.067 --> 17:08.067
I was so angry,

17:08.067 --> 17:10.667
and I... I just lost it.

17:10.733 --> 17:12.900
I think you know
something about that, hmm?

17:23.667 --> 17:25.567
I didn't do anything that bad.

17:25.633 --> 17:28.700
I just didn't like Elisa
hanging out with Austin.

17:28.767 --> 17:30.467
You mean
you wanted him for yourself,

17:30.533 --> 17:32.067
and you couldn't take it

17:32.067 --> 17:34.467
that he was
all about Elisa, right?

17:36.567 --> 17:38.800
I try and do
everything right,

17:38.867 --> 17:41.933
but it just doesn't
seem to be working.

17:42.067 --> 17:42.967
And what do you think
will happen

17:43.067 --> 17:45.367
if you don't do
everything right?

17:47.733 --> 17:50.433
My parents
are always working,

17:50.500 --> 17:51.667
it's take-out
every night,

17:51.733 --> 17:54.067
and I'm alone
eating it.

17:54.100 --> 17:56.567
This morning, I had
Chinese food for breakfast.

17:56.633 --> 17:57.733
No one even cared.

17:59.733 --> 18:00.767
I even streaked
my hair red once,

18:00.833 --> 18:02.467
and no one even noticed!

18:04.433 --> 18:06.467
Oh, honey, I had no idea.

18:08.233 --> 18:11.067
We never meant
to make you feel like this.

18:11.100 --> 18:13.333
I feel like
no matter what I do,

18:13.400 --> 18:14.800
whether I flunk
or get an "A",

18:14.867 --> 18:17.767
no one cares.

18:17.833 --> 18:21.833
Of course we care.

18:21.900 --> 18:23.067
Sweetheart, listen,

18:23.067 --> 18:25.767
you cannot control
how other people react,

18:25.833 --> 18:28.800
you can only control
your own behavior.

18:28.867 --> 18:32.433
And your parents
work hard for you,

18:32.500 --> 18:33.900
and they deserve
a little respect,

18:33.967 --> 18:36.933
not this bad girl act
you're putting on.

18:39.733 --> 18:41.067
I'm sorry.

18:42.067 --> 18:42.967
Am I grounded?

18:43.067 --> 18:45.500
Oh, yeah, big time.

18:45.567 --> 18:47.367
Because we care.

18:48.900 --> 18:50.967
And I promise you,

18:51.067 --> 18:53.567
either your dad or I
will be with you

18:53.633 --> 18:54.667
every night for dinner.

18:54.733 --> 18:55.700
Okay?

18:58.067 --> 18:59.633
Thank you.

18:59.700 --> 19:01.600
It's gonna be all right.

19:13.133 --> 19:14.100
Aw...

19:20.667 --> 19:23.233
I'm really sorry
I was mean to you.

19:23.300 --> 19:25.100
I was just feeling crappy
about myself,

19:25.167 --> 19:26.900
and I took it out on you.

19:28.833 --> 19:32.067
Well... okay.

19:32.100 --> 19:33.467
I'm sorry you're
feeling crappy.

19:34.867 --> 19:36.067
Everyone has their crap.

19:37.700 --> 19:41.100
I'd really like to be friends.

19:42.767 --> 19:43.700
Okay.

19:43.767 --> 19:44.767
Me too.

19:44.833 --> 19:46.600
Okay,
let's go.

19:49.167 --> 19:50.700
You know...

19:50.767 --> 19:52.867
you were amazing back there.

19:52.933 --> 19:54.833
Just a little tough love.

19:54.900 --> 19:56.533
No, but it was
more than that.

19:56.600 --> 19:58.067
You were intuitive,
you were insightful,

19:58.067 --> 20:00.000
and you had this
real calming presence.

20:00.067 --> 20:03.167
I... I'd say you were
a natural born mediator.

20:03.233 --> 20:06.533
Well, thank you,
that's very flattering.

20:06.600 --> 20:09.400
Well, if she can get
Lucy King to apologize,

20:09.467 --> 20:10.600
she's a miracle worker.

20:10.667 --> 20:13.800
Wonderful, thank you.

20:13.867 --> 20:15.133
Come on, darling.

20:27.233 --> 20:28.600
"Dear, Liam,

20:28.667 --> 20:31.033
"Cooper Management
regrets to inform you

20:31.100 --> 20:32.933
"that based upon
your evaluation,

20:33.000 --> 20:36.867
your services
will no longer be needed"?

20:36.933 --> 20:38.933
"Yours truly, Gigi Cooper,

20:39.000 --> 20:41.700
Manager of Miracle Mirabel."

20:43.167 --> 20:46.867
I just can't believe that
I'm a real working model now.

20:46.933 --> 20:48.000
Can you
believe that--

20:48.067 --> 20:50.800
-I'm fired?
-Uh, what do you mean?

20:55.867 --> 20:56.867
You know, I think
we should have a talk

20:56.933 --> 20:57.867
with your new manager.

20:57.933 --> 21:00.067
You think?

21:00.100 --> 21:02.667
She is in so much trouble.

21:07.800 --> 21:09.067
What a day.

21:09.100 --> 21:11.633
With three girls,
it's always going to be chaotic.

21:13.267 --> 21:16.733
You know, sometimes, I...

21:16.800 --> 21:20.133
I feel like
I'm failing Isabella.

21:20.200 --> 21:22.167
You know, like she's
looking down at me

21:22.233 --> 21:24.067
just shaking her head.

21:24.133 --> 21:27.600
Our Isabella wasn't perfect.

21:27.667 --> 21:31.067
I'm sure
if she was here right now,

21:31.133 --> 21:33.833
you'd be struggling
through this together.

21:35.233 --> 21:37.367
Thanks.

21:37.433 --> 21:39.533
You know, if my memory
serves me correctly,

21:39.600 --> 21:42.067
Isabella had a mean girl streak.

21:42.100 --> 21:43.467
I know.

21:43.533 --> 21:44.933
I was the target.

21:45.067 --> 21:46.833
And that's because
she liked you.

21:49.833 --> 21:53.100
Ricky, you're a good dad.

21:53.167 --> 21:54.500
Don't beat yourself up.

21:54.567 --> 21:55.600
Believe it.

21:58.733 --> 22:01.100
Take Elisa home.

22:28.100 --> 22:30.833
I'm sorry about what
you went through today.

22:30.900 --> 22:32.267
It's okay.

22:32.333 --> 22:34.167
No.

22:34.233 --> 22:36.100
It's not.

22:37.600 --> 22:38.867
Were you ever bullied?

22:41.800 --> 22:44.233
I wasn't.

22:44.300 --> 22:48.067
But I was the little brother,
so I was teased,

22:48.067 --> 22:50.667
a lot.

22:50.733 --> 22:55.633
Uncle Bill and his friends
used to call me "Icky Ricky."

22:55.700 --> 22:57.300
That's bad.

22:57.367 --> 22:58.867
Yeah.

22:58.933 --> 23:00.100
Yeah, but who became

23:00.167 --> 23:02.800
a professional
baseball player, huh?

23:06.133 --> 23:08.900
Daddy?

23:08.967 --> 23:10.633
When did it stop?

23:13.400 --> 23:15.067
When I hit my growth spurt,

23:15.100 --> 23:19.400
and grew taller than Uncle Bill
and all his buddies.

23:20.833 --> 23:22.400
Maybe I'll be tall.

23:28.800 --> 23:31.433
Look, I want you to know

23:31.500 --> 23:32.900
that you can come to me
with anything--

23:39.067 --> 23:40.700
I know.

23:41.933 --> 23:43.900
Thanks, Dad.

23:43.967 --> 23:45.700
Or should I say...

23:45.767 --> 23:47.633
thanks, Icky Ricky?

23:47.700 --> 23:48.633
Ooh...

23:48.700 --> 23:50.833
watch it, watch it.

23:50.900 --> 23:53.367
And please,
do not remind your Uncle Bill.

23:54.467 --> 23:56.400
I am so sorry,

23:56.467 --> 23:58.067
but I'm gonna
have to tell him this.

24:03.500 --> 24:05.100
You're worse than Uncle Bill
with the "Icky Ricky--"

24:05.167 --> 24:06.133
Dad!

24:07.767 --> 24:08.800
This is so bad,

24:08.867 --> 24:09.767
I am so sorry.

24:09.833 --> 24:10.967
What's wrong, sweetie?

24:11.067 --> 24:12.833
I wasn't supposed
to tell you.

24:12.900 --> 24:15.067
You know he hates
when you start with that.

24:15.067 --> 24:17.233
I decided to manage
Mirabel's Instagram career,

24:17.300 --> 24:18.567
and now
the whole Internet hates her,

24:18.633 --> 24:19.933
and is saying
she's ugly,

24:20.067 --> 24:21.400
and at first they were
covering her pages with horses,

24:21.467 --> 24:23.767
and now they're stalking her
in real life.

24:23.833 --> 24:25.800
Wait, wait, wait,
horses? Stalking?

24:25.867 --> 24:27.867
What are you
talking about, Gigi?

24:27.933 --> 24:29.367
Mirabel's getting dragged
on the web.

24:45.433 --> 24:47.300
Mirabel?

24:47.367 --> 24:49.167
Honey, what's going on?

24:49.233 --> 24:51.300
It's really bad, Papi.

24:51.367 --> 24:54.767
They're saying
such mean things about me

24:54.833 --> 24:57.200
and some of them
are really inappropriate.

24:57.267 --> 24:59.267
It's really bad.

24:59.333 --> 25:01.067
Oh, my God.

25:01.067 --> 25:03.267
I-I-I don't want you
to read that garbage.

25:03.333 --> 25:04.633
It-it's garbage, okay?

25:04.700 --> 25:06.300
Don't look at it again.
You got it?

25:07.933 --> 25:10.100
It's really bad, Papi.

25:10.167 --> 25:11.833
Some of them are asking
for my address, and...

25:11.900 --> 25:12.967
Hey, hey...

25:13.067 --> 25:13.900
...and the school I go to.

25:13.967 --> 25:15.200
It's okay,
it's okay.

25:15.267 --> 25:17.200
I'm going to take care of this,
don't worry.

25:17.267 --> 25:19.167
Just don't go online again.

25:19.233 --> 25:20.333
L-Let me deal with this.

25:20.400 --> 25:22.867
Just... just let me think.

25:22.933 --> 25:24.067
Okay? It's okay.

25:24.133 --> 25:26.067
I'm so sorry, Papi.

25:26.100 --> 25:27.167
It's okay,
it's okay.

25:27.233 --> 25:29.067
Hey, it's okay.

25:29.100 --> 25:30.067
It's over.

25:30.067 --> 25:31.367
Now.

25:31.433 --> 25:35.500
This whole online presence
of yours, it's over.

25:35.567 --> 25:36.500
Right now.

25:41.567 --> 25:43.333
Stephanie...

25:43.400 --> 25:46.167
How fast
can you get to my house?

25:46.233 --> 25:48.200
Hey, guys!

25:48.267 --> 25:50.133
A lot of my followers
write to me

25:50.200 --> 25:52.333
bout how their favorite mattesa
just totally dry out their
lips.

25:52.400 --> 25:55.967
That's because matte lipstick
use more wax than oil,

25:56.067 --> 25:57.600
and since less oil
is being used,

25:57.667 --> 25:59.433
then lips tend to dry out
more quickly.

25:59.500 --> 26:01.067
That's okay,

26:01.067 --> 26:03.833
ecause Mirabel's got a miracleb
just for you.

26:14.700 --> 26:16.067
I shut
everything down.

26:16.067 --> 26:17.533
Her website,
Instagram,

26:17.600 --> 26:19.067
Facebook, all of it.

26:19.100 --> 26:20.200
I disabled the comments,

26:20.267 --> 26:22.133
and removed all her profiles.

26:23.400 --> 26:24.567
Thanks for helping me.

26:24.633 --> 26:25.833
I know you're busy.

26:25.900 --> 26:27.767
I just didn't know
who else to call.

26:27.833 --> 26:29.367
Anytime.

26:30.533 --> 26:33.100
Those comments
were hard to read.

26:33.167 --> 26:34.300
It brought me back
to high school.

26:36.067 --> 26:38.067
I mean, when you and I
were growing up,

26:38.067 --> 26:39.867
we could make mistakes
without everyone knowing.

26:39.933 --> 26:41.067
I mean, these kids
make a mistake,

26:41.133 --> 26:42.233
and the whole world knows.

26:42.300 --> 26:43.767
I know, it's terrifying.

26:43.833 --> 26:47.067
I-I feel like I'm navigating
through uncharted territory.

26:47.067 --> 26:50.067
Well, Mirabel's lucky
to have a dad like you.

26:50.067 --> 26:53.067
They all are.

26:53.100 --> 26:55.067
I didn't feel it today.

26:55.133 --> 26:56.833
Hey...

26:58.167 --> 27:00.333
You may be
a single dad, but...

27:00.400 --> 27:04.067
you don't
have to do this alone.

27:09.567 --> 27:12.367
So, I saved everything
to the drive.

27:12.433 --> 27:14.533
It's a cached version
only you have access to,

27:14.600 --> 27:16.433
in case you ever want to see
the videos.

27:16.500 --> 27:18.367
No, thank you.

27:18.433 --> 27:20.633
They're surprisingly
informative.

27:32.967 --> 27:34.967
Hey...

27:35.067 --> 27:36.133
you okay?

27:36.200 --> 27:37.467
Yeah.

27:37.533 --> 27:39.400
No...

27:39.467 --> 27:41.400
I don't know.

27:45.667 --> 27:47.967
Does someone need help
with their wing-tips?

27:48.067 --> 27:50.500
Your eye makeup?

27:52.100 --> 27:54.233
I'll take that as a yes.

27:56.200 --> 27:57.567
Come with me.

28:05.067 --> 28:06.433
Stephanie's here.

28:06.500 --> 28:07.667
They're dealing with it.

28:08.733 --> 28:10.500
I don't want to talk about it.

28:10.567 --> 28:11.667
Not right now.

28:11.733 --> 28:12.933
Okay.

28:13.067 --> 28:14.167
Fix my eyes.

28:26.733 --> 28:30.133
I remember the first time
I tried to do eyeliner...

28:31.567 --> 28:33.367
pretty sure
I gave myself Pink Eye.

28:33.433 --> 28:35.067
Really?

28:35.133 --> 28:37.467
But you're so good at makeup.

28:39.333 --> 28:41.300
I guess I'd better be.

28:41.367 --> 28:44.233
Apparently, I need a lot of it.

28:44.300 --> 28:45.933
Apparently, I'm a horse.

28:46.067 --> 28:47.700
Well...

28:47.767 --> 28:51.067
you're a really pretty horse
with the best mane ever.

28:52.533 --> 28:53.567
No.

28:53.633 --> 28:55.067
That's you.

28:55.133 --> 28:57.067
You have the best mane ever.

28:57.133 --> 28:58.933
I do?

28:59.067 --> 29:00.133
Yeah.

29:00.200 --> 29:01.267
I would kill
for your waves,

29:01.333 --> 29:03.267
and those curls.

29:04.467 --> 29:05.733
Thanks, Mirabel.

29:05.800 --> 29:08.200
And I don't think
you should care

29:08.267 --> 29:10.700
what other
people think.

29:10.767 --> 29:12.367
I know.

29:12.433 --> 29:14.100
It's hard not to.

29:14.167 --> 29:16.133
Let's try our best not to,

29:16.200 --> 29:18.267
okay?

29:18.333 --> 29:20.533
Deal, hermana.

29:21.467 --> 29:22.600
You know,

29:22.667 --> 29:24.133
you're pretty smart
for a tween.

29:25.400 --> 29:27.500
Everyone thinks
Gigi's the genius,

29:27.567 --> 29:29.433
but... it's actually me.

29:33.767 --> 29:36.233
Ooh, can we try
a matte lip, too?

29:36.300 --> 29:37.800
Everyone's talking
about mattes.

29:37.867 --> 29:41.667
And, uh, what exactly
brought this on?

29:41.733 --> 29:45.067
I mean, you're usually
putting grease under your eyes.

29:46.300 --> 29:47.967
Eye Black?

29:48.067 --> 29:49.800
Can't I wear makeup, too?

29:49.867 --> 29:52.300
That's not
what I meant.

29:53.733 --> 29:55.600
It's just, usually,

29:55.667 --> 29:57.767
you're not really
the makeup type, you know?

30:12.633 --> 30:14.767
Do you think I'm weird?

30:16.267 --> 30:19.000
Elisa, no.

30:19.067 --> 30:21.567
Of course not.

30:21.633 --> 30:23.600
If anyone tells you different,

30:23.667 --> 30:25.067
they're haters.

30:26.300 --> 30:28.700
It's just...

30:28.767 --> 30:32.700
I feel so different
from other girls.

30:32.767 --> 30:35.500
I wanted to feel normal
for once.

30:35.567 --> 30:38.500
Let me tell you something.

30:38.567 --> 30:42.267
There's no such thing as normal.

30:42.333 --> 30:45.500
People can be cruel.

30:45.567 --> 30:48.133
That doesn't mean that
you have to change for them.

30:50.433 --> 30:53.500
You're already amazing.

30:55.267 --> 30:57.233
You know,

30:57.300 --> 31:00.167
reading what everyone
wrote about me,

31:00.233 --> 31:02.633
complete strangers,

31:02.700 --> 31:06.267
it made me realize something,

31:06.333 --> 31:09.533
there's always going to be
trolls in the world.

31:09.600 --> 31:11.333
There's always
going to be people

31:11.400 --> 31:13.400
that want to bring you down.

31:14.567 --> 31:17.133
Yeah, I know what you mean.

31:17.200 --> 31:20.733
But when we're at
our lowest point,

31:20.800 --> 31:22.700
that's when
our super powers kick in.

31:22.767 --> 31:24.700
Super powers?

31:25.900 --> 31:28.733
We have the power
to rise above them,

31:28.800 --> 31:29.733
you and me.

31:40.233 --> 31:42.267
Superpower sisters.

31:46.333 --> 31:47.300
Boom.

31:49.500 --> 31:50.767
Come here.

32:05.833 --> 32:09.300
Family communication
is vital, you guys.

32:09.367 --> 32:10.800
If something
isn't going right at school,

32:10.867 --> 32:12.433
or getting out of hand online,

32:12.500 --> 32:13.900
I need to know about it.

32:13.967 --> 32:15.400
But...

32:15.467 --> 32:18.067
sometimes, it's hard
to talk about.

32:18.133 --> 32:20.567
I don't exactly want to go over
the horrible day I just had

32:20.633 --> 32:21.700
with my dad.

32:21.767 --> 32:24.300
And sometimes,
I just think

32:24.367 --> 32:25.733
maybe you won't
understand.

32:25.800 --> 32:28.967
I'm not always going
to understand everything...

32:29.067 --> 32:31.233
you girls are into,

32:31.300 --> 32:33.467
but I love you,

32:33.533 --> 32:34.967
and I need to know
what's going on

32:35.067 --> 32:38.533
before it becomes
much, much worse.

32:41.767 --> 32:44.400
You need to take
this seriously.

32:44.467 --> 32:48.267
Kids have hurt themselves
because of bullying and hate.

32:48.333 --> 32:50.600
Dad's right.

32:50.667 --> 32:54.400
When I read
all those comments, I...

32:54.467 --> 32:58.167
I just wanted the ground
to swallow me up.

32:58.233 --> 32:59.500
And that's
just the beginning.

33:02.433 --> 33:04.900
If those people who wrote
those comments knew you,

33:04.967 --> 33:07.567
they would never write
those words.

33:09.933 --> 33:12.800
It's easy to hide
behind a screen.

33:12.867 --> 33:15.233
It's cowardly.

33:16.900 --> 33:19.967
All right, from here on out,

33:20.067 --> 33:21.567
let's make a deal.

33:23.467 --> 33:25.867
If someone
is making us feel "less than,"

33:25.933 --> 33:28.833
we're going
to talk it out.

33:28.900 --> 33:32.700
And if we see someone
getting bullied,

33:32.767 --> 33:35.567
we're going to do something
about it.

33:35.633 --> 33:36.667
Okay?

33:43.633 --> 33:44.833
Poof!

33:50.067 --> 33:51.333
You guys get to bed.

33:57.967 --> 33:59.533
Oh, hey.

33:59.600 --> 34:01.333
Alan...

34:01.400 --> 34:02.867
Are you okay?

34:02.933 --> 34:03.967
No, I'm, uh...

34:05.567 --> 34:07.067
I-I'm shocked.

34:07.100 --> 34:08.567
I'm-I'm... floored.
I...

34:08.633 --> 34:10.133
Okay.

34:10.200 --> 34:11.667
Hey, listen,
if this isn't a good time,

34:11.733 --> 34:13.067
I'll leave these with you,
you sign them later,

34:13.133 --> 34:14.433
I'll get them tomorrow at work.

34:15.967 --> 34:17.367
No, no,

34:17.433 --> 34:19.067
this is a good time.

34:19.100 --> 34:20.333
For a drink.

34:20.400 --> 34:21.767
Come in.

34:21.833 --> 34:22.767
Hey.

34:24.067 --> 34:25.367
Thanks.

34:26.833 --> 34:27.733
I'm telling you,
Alan...

34:29.800 --> 34:32.067
the things these...
people wrote

34:32.100 --> 34:35.567
about my daughter.

34:35.633 --> 34:39.333
It was ugly, and-
and hateful, and...

34:41.733 --> 34:46.400
I'm not a parent,
but I can imagine.

34:46.467 --> 34:48.467
My parents had to deal with it,

34:48.533 --> 34:49.933
and it wasn't easy for them.

34:52.467 --> 34:55.400
I had a rough time
in high school.

34:55.467 --> 34:58.367
A pretty bad time
in middle school.

35:00.200 --> 35:02.900
But, you know,
I didn't have this thing

35:02.967 --> 35:04.667
to remind me
every single second

35:04.733 --> 35:05.767
of every day

35:05.833 --> 35:07.667
how unkind people are.

35:07.733 --> 35:09.067
Yeah.

35:09.067 --> 35:11.967
It's this constant
reassurance kids need,

35:12.067 --> 35:16.367
you know, the "likes"
and "hearts,"

35:16.433 --> 35:17.733
and that's how
they measure themselves

35:17.800 --> 35:18.900
up against their peers.

35:18.967 --> 35:21.833
And then the comments, it's...

35:24.733 --> 35:27.833
I am so happy

35:27.900 --> 35:29.900
we didn't have the Internet
when we were kids.

35:31.133 --> 35:33.133
Yeah.

35:33.200 --> 35:35.633
Yeah, I'm grateful for that.

35:37.067 --> 35:38.867
To not-stupid people.

35:41.900 --> 35:43.833
To not-stupid people.

36:29.167 --> 36:30.100
Hey, Elisa.

36:30.167 --> 36:31.833
Oh, Austin.

36:31.900 --> 36:33.067
Hi.

36:33.067 --> 36:35.600
Did you, uh,
get my friend request?

36:35.667 --> 36:36.633
You know,

36:36.700 --> 36:38.200
I haven't checked.

36:38.267 --> 36:41.867
I think I might actually stay
off the grid for a while.

36:41.933 --> 36:44.400
Listen, I'm sorry
about the other day.

36:44.467 --> 36:45.733
That wasn't cool.

36:45.800 --> 36:46.967
At all.

36:47.067 --> 36:48.067
I was a real jerk.

36:48.067 --> 36:49.500
I'm so sorry.

36:49.567 --> 36:51.400
You were.

36:51.467 --> 36:53.567
But I get it.

36:53.633 --> 36:54.667
It can be hard to speak up

36:54.733 --> 36:56.067
if it's not you
going through it.

36:56.133 --> 36:58.567
Yeah, but that doesn't
make it right.

36:58.633 --> 37:00.933
I was really wrong, Elisa,
I'm so sorry.

37:03.067 --> 37:04.533
Thanks.

37:04.600 --> 37:05.700
It's okay.

37:05.767 --> 37:07.833
I could show you my curveball?

37:07.900 --> 37:08.833
Maybe you'd have some tips?

37:10.067 --> 37:12.067
You have a curveball?

37:12.067 --> 37:13.167
Really, now?

37:13.233 --> 37:14.967
Well, not exactly,

37:15.067 --> 37:16.533
I'm working on one.

37:16.600 --> 37:17.667
I'll be the judge
of that.

37:25.233 --> 37:26.733
Well, well, well...

37:28.067 --> 37:29.533
If it isn't
little Miss Manager.

37:29.600 --> 37:30.567
Look,

37:30.633 --> 37:32.567
I just want to apologize.

37:32.633 --> 37:34.133
This book I was reading

37:34.200 --> 37:36.700
just brought out
the unbridled capitalist in me,

37:36.767 --> 37:38.333
and just like the free market,

37:38.400 --> 37:40.067
we all just need
a little regulation.

37:43.933 --> 37:46.067
I'm sorry
for being such a jerk,

37:46.133 --> 37:49.867
and, well,
let's just say,

37:49.933 --> 37:53.800
these past few days have
given me a lot to think about.

37:58.900 --> 38:00.100
Don't sweat it.

38:02.733 --> 38:04.167
Well, I was wondering
about the best way

38:04.233 --> 38:06.200
to get the message out
to all the kids.

38:06.267 --> 38:08.800
What if the message
wasn't just to kids?

38:08.867 --> 38:11.633
What if we could speak
to a larger audience?

38:12.867 --> 38:14.067
What are you thinking?

38:14.133 --> 38:17.867
I'm thinking that
I have a famous son-in-law.

38:19.400 --> 38:22.100
I'm thinking
I like what you're thinking.

38:22.167 --> 38:23.600
Gotta go.

38:29.067 --> 38:30.800
Ricky, it's me.

38:30.867 --> 38:33.267
I have got a great idea.

38:39.400 --> 38:40.900
All right, all right,
can I have your attention?

38:40.967 --> 38:42.267
Good morning, everyone.

38:42.333 --> 38:44.200
Good morning, Mr. Reed.

38:44.267 --> 38:46.967
Bullying...

38:47.067 --> 38:49.967
you know, it's like a weed.

38:50.067 --> 38:52.300
If you don't pull it out
by the roots,

38:52.367 --> 38:54.167
it'll come back,

38:54.233 --> 38:56.567
and then it spreads.

38:56.633 --> 39:00.133
And a very wise person taught me

39:00.200 --> 39:03.100
that the best way
to stop bullying

39:03.167 --> 39:06.067
is person to person.

39:06.133 --> 39:08.100
So now I'd like
to introduce you to a person

39:08.167 --> 39:10.867
that you thought you knew.

39:10.933 --> 39:11.967
Lucy King.

39:17.067 --> 39:19.900
If you squeeze
a tube of toothpaste,

39:19.967 --> 39:22.133
the toothpaste comes out easily.

39:22.200 --> 39:24.933
But trying to put it back in?

39:25.067 --> 39:26.867
These are the words
you've said out loud

39:26.933 --> 39:28.833
or posted online.

39:28.900 --> 39:31.733
Once they're out there,
they're out there.

39:31.800 --> 39:34.067
And no matter how sorry you are,

39:34.100 --> 39:36.900
you can never take them back.

39:36.967 --> 39:39.067
But in person,

39:39.067 --> 39:43.200
you can apologize.

39:43.267 --> 39:45.233
Elisa Cooper,

39:45.300 --> 39:48.100
I am truly sorry.

39:49.400 --> 39:52.933
And I can promise
it never will happen again.

39:54.967 --> 39:57.333
I really hope we can be friends.

40:01.867 --> 40:03.067
And now,

40:03.133 --> 40:04.867
a video on bullying

40:04.933 --> 40:07.267
from The Cooper Family.

40:11.733 --> 40:13.033
Hi there.

40:13.100 --> 40:13.933
For all of you
who don't know me,

40:14.000 --> 40:15.100
I'm Ricky Cooper,

40:15.167 --> 40:16.467
professional baseball player.

40:16.533 --> 40:18.033
Ex-professional

40:18.100 --> 40:18.967
baseball player.

40:20.567 --> 40:22.800
Ricky, on video]: That's true,[
but all joking aside,

40:22.867 --> 40:24.400
we're here to talk to you
about bullying,

40:24.467 --> 40:25.800
which is no joke.

40:25.867 --> 40:28.033
Over 70% of young people

40:28.100 --> 40:29.933
have witnessed bullying
at their school.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.933
And 15% of students have
been electronically bullied

40:33.000 --> 40:34.433
just this past year.

40:34.500 --> 40:36.933
And over 50%
of all those bullied

40:37.000 --> 40:38.967
identify as LGBTQ.

40:39.033 --> 40:41.000
Many of them
choose to remain silent,

40:41.067 --> 40:43.167
but bullying can stop
in ten seconds

40:43.233 --> 40:44.300
when someone speaks up.

40:44.367 --> 40:46.300
But cyber-bullying
is different.

40:46.367 --> 40:47.533
With cyber-bullying,

40:47.600 --> 40:49.667
bullying doesn't end
on the playground.

40:49.733 --> 40:51.300
It follows you
all the way home.

40:51.367 --> 40:54.133
Hate mail, name-calling,
physical fights,

40:54.200 --> 40:56.100
all can have
deadly consequences.

40:56.167 --> 40:57.433
Persistent bullying,

40:57.500 --> 41:00.067
whether online or in person,

41:00.133 --> 41:02.400
can lead to feelings
of despair, isolation,

41:02.467 --> 41:05.133
anxiety, and depression.

41:05.200 --> 41:07.100
This leaves
a huge impact

41:07.167 --> 41:09.800
on your community,
your friends, and...

41:09.867 --> 41:11.267
Your family.

41:11.333 --> 41:13.400
But it's not hopeless,

41:13.467 --> 41:16.067
and you can make a difference.

41:16.067 --> 41:17.833
Take it from me,

41:17.900 --> 41:19.733
I was a bully.

41:19.800 --> 41:21.267
But now...

41:21.333 --> 41:22.500
we're friends.

41:22.567 --> 41:26.167
It's not hopeless
for you, or the bully.

41:26.233 --> 41:28.067
So think
before you type.

41:28.100 --> 41:29.967
Take action over silence.

41:30.067 --> 41:31.800
And together...

41:31.867 --> 41:33.100
We can stop
bullying...

41:33.167 --> 41:34.633
Before it starts.

41:34.700 --> 41:38.367
And if you or a friend
are experiencing bullying,

41:38.433 --> 41:40.467
please remember
that it does get better.

41:42.167 --> 41:44.067
Know
hat people are here for you...t

41:44.100 --> 41:45.900
That you are loved...

41:45.967 --> 41:47.233
You are strong...

41:47.300 --> 41:49.067
And you are not alone.
