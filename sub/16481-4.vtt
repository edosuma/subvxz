- No.

02:13.513 --> 02:15.015
to change into a costume with a subtle

02:15.016 --> 02:17.019

21:31.208 --> 21:32.644
<i>the most magical night of the year.</i>

21:32.645 --> 21:35.817
<i>But this Chanel-O-Ween,
my life is in tatters.</i>

21:35.818 --> 21:38.088
<i>First, I find out that
whore Dean Munsch</i>

21:38.089 --> 21:40.793
<i>has inherited the
entire Radwell fortune.</i>

21:40.794 --> 21:44.634
<i>Then, I see that dumb security
guard wearing</i> my <i>wedding gown.</i>

21:44.635 --> 21:47.306
<i>And then, I turn blue.</i>

21:47.307 --> 21:49.511
CHANEL: There you are,

21:49.512 --> 21:50.646
you bitch.

21:50.647 --> 21:52.416
I know you're in on it.

21:52.417 --> 21:53.451
You had Chad murdered

21:53.452 --> 21:54.688
because you couldn't stand the fact

21:54.689 --> 21:56.190
that he was gonna marry me.

21:56.191 --> 21:58.596
And here you are, in my wedding gown.

21:58.597 --> 22:01.735
I mean, you may as well have
just signed a confession.

22:01.736 --> 22:03.939
First of all...

22:03.940 --> 22:05.408
I look amazing.

22:05.409 --> 22:08.047
And I'll admit, I was
surprised when I tried it on

22:08.048 --> 22:09.483
and it fit like a glove.

22:09.484 --> 22:11.320
'Cause, you know, we got
different body types.

22:11.321 --> 22:13.124
My body type is...

22:13.125 --> 22:14.494
"woman."

22:14.495 --> 22:16.097
And yours is...

22:16.098 --> 22:18.134
"malnourished Victorian paperboy."

22:18.135 --> 22:19.838
And second,

22:19.839 --> 22:23.144
Chad Radwell was <i>never</i> gonna marry you.

22:23.145 --> 22:25.148
In fact, just a few weeks ago,

22:25.149 --> 22:27.921
during our <i>American Beauty</i>
role-playing session,

22:27.922 --> 22:30.125
he said, and I quote...

22:30.126 --> 22:33.298
♪ ♪

22:33.299 --> 22:35.302
Run away with me, Angela.

22:35.303 --> 22:37.272
I've been living a lie.

22:37.273 --> 22:38.441
I don't love her anymore.

22:38.442 --> 22:39.778
I only love you.

22:39.779 --> 22:42.149
Oh, Lester.

22:42.150 --> 22:43.986
You given me the vapors.

22:43.987 --> 22:45.656
Ah...

22:45.657 --> 22:49.330
It's a good thing this tub is
filled up with rose petals,

22:49.331 --> 22:52.237
'cause that way you
can't smell my toots.

22:54.241 --> 22:55.577
Kiss me.

22:58.282 --> 23:00.686
CHANEL: <i>He just said that</i>

23:00.687 --> 23:02.490
because it's the plot of the film!

23:02.491 --> 23:03.792
Is it?

23:03.793 --> 23:05.128
'Cause I don't remember nobody

23:05.129 --> 23:07.800
in that movie saying
they had the vapors.

23:07.801 --> 23:09.838
Just admit it, you
murdered Chad Radwell!

23:09.839 --> 23:12.276
Shh! You stupid ho!

23:12.277 --> 23:14.213
I ain't murdered nobody!

23:14.214 --> 23:17.452
If anybody is behind my
sweet boo getting murdered,

23:17.453 --> 23:19.390
it's that Dean Munsch.

23:19.391 --> 23:23.164
She was the one that inherited
the Radwell family fortune.

23:23.165 --> 23:25.201
And she probably had help

23:25.202 --> 23:28.909
from that "Shay-day" Zayday Williams.

23:28.910 --> 23:31.213
It's time to enlist the
help of an old friend

23:31.214 --> 23:34.153
- who always tells the truth.
- Who?

23:34.154 --> 23:36.190
My old talking board, that's who.

23:36.191 --> 23:38.161
We're gonna talk to Chad
from beyond the grave,

23:38.162 --> 23:39.597
and ask him who he loved more

23:39.598 --> 23:41.535
and find out once and for
all who murdered him.

23:41.536 --> 23:43.939
Mm, there is nobody

23:43.940 --> 23:46.611
who loves trafficking the dark arts

23:46.612 --> 23:51.220
like this top FBI recruit
from Quantico, Virginia.

23:51.221 --> 23:52.790
Bitch, I'm in.

23:52.791 --> 23:54.227
(SCOFFS)

23:59.261 --> 24:01.999
Chanel, I've been looking
all over for you.

24:02.000 --> 24:05.105
I mean, not literally, but in
my mind, I was looking for...

24:05.106 --> 24:06.107
Oh, my God, it's true.

24:06.108 --> 24:07.911
Uh, that you poisoned me with a bottle

24:07.912 --> 24:10.095
of nickels and dimes
minted before 1964?

24:10.120 --> 24:11.659
Yes, it's true.

24:11.769 --> 24:13.438
This doesn't make any sense.

24:13.439 --> 24:15.008
The amount of silver that
I put in the solution

24:15.009 --> 24:16.916
was tiny... micrograms.

24:16.941 --> 24:18.843
This shouldn't be happening.

24:18.844 --> 24:21.448
I have a feeling that someone
tampered with my mixture.

24:21.449 --> 24:22.564
Oh, who would do that?

24:22.596 --> 24:24.031
I need the cure!

24:24.032 --> 24:25.267
Well, there is no cure for Argyria.

24:25.268 --> 24:25.962
What?!

24:25.987 --> 24:27.955
Well...

24:28.001 --> 24:29.886
But in the spirit of this
hospital, gosh darn it,

24:29.911 --> 24:31.045
I'm gonna find one.

24:31.046 --> 24:33.082
Of course, the next
few days, I'm booked.

24:33.083 --> 24:35.555
I mean, we do have the party and all,

24:35.556 --> 24:37.659
and I, and I scheduled an
appointment for laser treatment.

24:37.660 --> 24:39.596
- (WHISPERS): Ear hair removal.
- Mm.

24:39.597 --> 24:41.165
And I've got to get
to the dry cleaners.

24:41.166 --> 24:43.069
But after I get all that done,

24:43.070 --> 24:44.739
I promise I'm gonna come
up with a miracle cure.

24:44.740 --> 24:46.075
Dean Munsch,

24:46.076 --> 24:48.680
I demand that you have Dr.
Brock arrested immediately.

24:48.705 --> 24:49.806
On what charge?

24:49.830 --> 24:51.365
For assaulting me with silver!

24:51.366 --> 24:54.004
And... probably being in
cahoots with Denise Hemphill

24:54.005 --> 24:56.275
in murdering Chad and a
whole bunch of other people

24:56.276 --> 24:57.478
with his serial killer hand!

24:57.479 --> 24:58.947
MUNSCH: Chanel, look,

24:58.948 --> 25:01.018
I know you are feeling a tad blue

25:01.019 --> 25:03.222
right now,

25:03.223 --> 25:06.963
but Dr. Brock Holt did not murder Chad.

25:06.964 --> 25:08.802
He has an airtight alibi.

25:09.737 --> 25:10.572
He does?

25:10.573 --> 25:12.007
That's wonderful.

25:12.008 --> 25:13.677
I mean, I didn't want to believe

25:13.678 --> 25:15.414
that it was true, but after the silver

25:15.415 --> 25:17.083
and I knew you were jealous of Chad,

25:17.084 --> 25:19.890
I just... oh, I didn't
know what else to think.

25:20.559 --> 25:21.860
Forgive me?

25:21.861 --> 25:23.062
You know, he and I

25:23.063 --> 25:25.166
were having a little
of the jiffy stiffy

25:25.167 --> 25:27.103
in my office, right before the wedding,

25:27.104 --> 25:28.941
right when Chad was being killed.

25:28.942 --> 25:30.578
What?!

25:30.579 --> 25:32.180
Well, see, I was
distraught, and I, and I,

25:32.181 --> 25:35.086
and I needed comfort, and-and
Dean Munsch was there.

25:35.087 --> 25:37.425
Do you always keep a wig and
a corset in your office?

25:37.426 --> 25:39.529
Mm-hmm. Okay, I don't understand

25:39.530 --> 25:42.635
how all these middle-aged
women keep stealing my men.

25:42.636 --> 25:48.112
Perhaps it's because you insist
on Snapchatting during sex.

25:48.113 --> 25:50.116
That was one time!

25:50.117 --> 25:51.086
You know what?

25:51.087 --> 25:52.488
I am done.

25:52.489 --> 25:54.726
I am done with medicine, I'm
done with this hospital,

25:54.727 --> 25:56.061
and I am done with all of you.

25:56.062 --> 25:57.565
I'm leaving.

25:57.566 --> 25:59.769
Oh, no, no, no, you cannot leave

25:59.770 --> 26:01.840
until the Halloween party.

26:01.841 --> 26:05.346
Because we need a lot of bait
here to lure the killer in.

26:05.347 --> 26:07.217
- Then take in some more patients.
- I don't know much

26:07.218 --> 26:09.288
about running a hospital, but
I do know if we bring in

26:09.289 --> 26:10.858
patients just so we can
get them killed...

26:10.859 --> 26:12.027
Yeah, no, no, no, we're not bringing in

26:12.028 --> 26:14.031
new patients until the
killer is caught.

26:14.032 --> 26:16.035
Look, Chanel, I'm sure

26:16.036 --> 26:18.306
once you develop
personally, professionally

26:18.307 --> 26:21.546
and physically, you'll have
no trouble keeping a man.

26:21.547 --> 26:23.450
This is the place to do that.

26:23.451 --> 26:24.652
Stay.

26:24.653 --> 26:26.288
No. Never!

26:26.289 --> 26:28.393
Catch the killer without
me, because I am out!

26:45.327 --> 26:48.000
Ivanka Trump?

26:49.503 --> 26:51.473
That costume is insane.

26:51.474 --> 26:52.609
Who is that... Number Three?

26:55.415 --> 26:57.551
What are you doing here?

26:57.552 --> 26:59.589
There's no patients in this wing.

26:59.590 --> 27:00.624
I'm serious.

27:00.625 --> 27:03.295
Who are you?

27:03.296 --> 27:07.939
Okay, this is just creepy,
so I'm gonna, I'm gonna go.

Ow!

27:46.984 --> 27:48.220
(SHRIEKS)

27:56.269 --> 27:58.840
And then I took my heel and
threw it right at her face

27:58.841 --> 28:00.176
and just ran as fast as I could.

28:00.177 --> 28:01.980
I mean, I don't know why
she didn't follow me.

28:01.981 --> 28:04.685
CHANEL #5: Well, Chanel,
you are safe now.

28:04.686 --> 28:06.221
But that does sound terrifying.

28:06.222 --> 28:07.858
Hold on, back it up a second, Chanel.

28:07.859 --> 28:09.829
What was the mask the
killer was wearing?

28:09.830 --> 28:10.799
Ivanka?

28:10.800 --> 28:12.168
Ivanka Trump! (GASPS)

28:13.805 --> 28:15.908
What is it?

28:15.909 --> 28:17.645
Why are you guys looking at Chanel #5?

28:17.646 --> 28:19.247
CHANEL #3: Because earlier,

28:19.248 --> 28:21.185
we helped her with her
Ivanka Trump costume.

28:21.186 --> 28:22.656
It's hanging in her closet.

28:23.524 --> 28:26.028
Okay, let's hold on one sec.

28:26.029 --> 28:27.432
I have been here all day!

28:30.438 --> 28:32.741
Except for when you
made that phone call.

28:32.742 --> 28:33.844
I was FaceTiming with somebody.

28:33.845 --> 28:35.747
Liar! No one wants to
look at your face.

28:35.748 --> 28:38.453
Where's the costume, Number Five?

28:38.454 --> 28:40.858
(GASPS)

28:40.859 --> 28:42.428
I have no idea, Chanel!

28:42.429 --> 28:43.864
Somebody must've taken it!

28:43.865 --> 28:46.268
You lying, murdering bitch!

28:46.269 --> 28:48.205
Of course you're the killer.

28:48.206 --> 28:49.976
What are you even talking about?

28:49.977 --> 28:51.479
I was attacked, too.

28:51.480 --> 28:52.648
Allegedly.

28:52.649 --> 28:54.217
Yeah, nobody saw it happen.

28:54.218 --> 28:55.921
CHANEL: You could've
easily faked the attack

28:55.922 --> 28:58.493
and left a trail of green slime
behind to throw everyone off.

28:58.494 --> 29:00.096
I mean, sure, you seemed upset,

29:00.097 --> 29:02.233
but you're barely holding
it together on a good day.

29:02.234 --> 29:03.570
CHANEL #3: Yeah.

29:03.571 --> 29:05.273
You had a full-on panic attack
that time we caught you

29:05.274 --> 29:06.943
eating spoonfuls of mayonnaise
straight from the jar.

29:06.944 --> 29:09.448
It is so unfair of you to try
to kill me, Number Five!

29:09.449 --> 29:11.586
I am telling you, I didn't do it!

29:11.587 --> 29:14.357
Oh, stick a hot dog in it, you manatee.

29:14.358 --> 29:17.932
You and I are officially
not friends anymore.

29:17.933 --> 29:21.773
Did you know that I wanted to
go as Ivanka Trump this year?

29:21.774 --> 29:23.543
Hmm? Yeah.

29:23.544 --> 29:25.747
She is an inspiration to us all.

29:25.748 --> 29:27.718
She's like the Chelsea Clinton

29:27.719 --> 29:29.822
from a parallel universe if
Hitler won the second World War!

29:29.823 --> 29:34.465
Okay, Chanel, I am telling
you, I didn't try to kill you!

29:34.466 --> 29:36.469
And don't even think of coming
to the Halloween party later.

29:36.470 --> 29:39.408
You can't uninvite me.

29:39.409 --> 29:41.946
This party is for all
of the hospital staff.

29:41.947 --> 29:43.950
And I will be there.

29:43.951 --> 29:45.922
Come hell or high water!

29:47.959 --> 29:50.964
If you show up to that party...

29:50.965 --> 29:52.368
we'll kill you.

Man, look at these costumes.

30:42.193 --> 30:44.330
Brock, what the hell
you supposed to be?

30:44.331 --> 30:46.401

30:53.215 --> 30:56.955
I told you, I'm Isis,
goddess of Ancient Egypt.

30:56.956 --> 30:58.525
It's a totally different Isis.

30:58.526 --> 31:00.061
I'm death.

31:00.062 --> 31:01.698

31:01.699 --> 31:04.370

blue for your costume?

Ergot was a fungus that grew on crops.

38:02.999 --> 38:04.468

similar in the sense

that they're both token

38:05.871 --> 38:06.872
and live in a fantasy world.

38:06.873 --> 38:08.509
Smurfette is so '80s,

whereas Ivanka Trump is so
of the moment, you know?

38:12.952 --> 38:14.488
I mean, she could
literally be appointed

me get this straight.

39:35.480 --> 39:39.362

didn't bob for apples.

39:39.387 --> 39:40.145
Is that right?

39:40.215 --> 39:42.218
That's right. I thought
an apple would go great

39:42.219 --> 39:44.556
with my Snow White
costume, so I grabbed one.

39:44.557 --> 39:46.593
And then it looked really
good, so I ate it.

39:46.594 --> 39:48.398
And you didn't start hallucinating?

39:49.466 --> 39:50.802
That means it can't be ergot poisoning;

39:50.803 --> 39:52.406
otherwise, she would be sick, too.

39:53.441 --> 39:54.910
I did notice one thing.

40:14.283 --> 40:15.684
You should've said that
from the beginning.

40:15.685 --> 40:18.490
But... bobbing for apples
can't be that sanitary, so...

40:18.491 --> 40:20.361
whoever did that, that
was super nice of them.

40:20.362 --> 40:22.866
It wasn't the apples
that were poisoned.

40:22.867 --> 40:24.336
It was the water.

40:29.480 --> 40:31.683
Okay, so the apples are
fine, just like you said,

40:31.684 --> 40:36.526
but... the water tested positive
for dimethyltryptamine, DMT.

40:36.527 --> 40:37.695
What the hell is DMT?

40:37.696 --> 40:39.399
They call it "the spirit molecule."

40:39.400 --> 40:41.036
It's the active ingredient

40:41.037 --> 40:43.273
in a hallucinogenic
drug called ayahuasca.

40:43.274 --> 40:44.609
<i>I mean, the dosage</i>

40:44.610 --> 40:46.947
was insane, but provided no one died

40:46.948 --> 40:49.452
of a heart attack for getting the
bejeebus scared out of them,

40:49.453 --> 40:51.322
and we keep them hydrated,
they should be able

40:51.323 --> 40:54.162
to recover in a few hours
with no long-term effects.

40:54.163 --> 40:56.901
Ayahuasca's a serious
drug, but rarely fatal.

40:56.902 --> 40:58.537
Well, that's good news.

40:58.538 --> 41:01.543
I'm going to go inform
some of their families.

excellent physician.

Not much of a serial killer,
that Green Meanie, is he?

41:12.332 --> 41:13.533
What do you mean?

41:13.534 --> 41:15.104
Trying to kill a party full of people

41:15.105 --> 41:16.874
with a drug that isn't lethal.

41:16.875 --> 41:19.113
Sounds pretty stupid to me.

41:24.356 --> 41:26.360
Maybe he didn't want to kill them.

41:29.901 --> 41:32.139
Maybe he wanted a distraction.

I was just talking to Chad

37:56.253 --> 37:57.621
Okay.

37:57.622 --> 37:59.858
Well... first of all,

37:59.859 --> 38:01.662
I think that Ivanka Trump
is such a better costume

38:01.663 --> 38:02.998
than Smurfette.

38:02.999 --> 38:04.468
I mean, they're sort of
similar in the sense

38:04.469 --> 38:05.870
that they're both token
women who are used as pawns

38:05.871 --> 38:06.872
and live in a fantasy world.

38:06.873 --> 38:08.509
Smurfette is so '80s,

38:08.510 --> 38:11.216
whereas Ivanka Trump is so
of the moment, you know?

38:12.952 --> 38:14.488
I mean, she could
literally be appointed

38:14.489 --> 38:17.127
minister of propaganda any second now.

Oh, come on, Chanel.

me over a Halloween costume

You are Ivanka.

I am Ivana.

38:34.429 --> 38:35.830
You get to be the sexy young face

38:35.831 --> 38:37.501

38:37.502 --> 38:38.736
authoritarian regime bent
on destroying everything

38:38.737 --> 38:39.672

me get this straight.

39:35.480 --> 39:39.362
You ate a apple, but you
didn't bob for apples.

39:39.387 --> 39:40.145
Is that right?

39:40.215 --> 39:42.218
That's right. I thought
an apple would go great

39:42.219 --> 39:44.556
with my Snow White
costume, so I grabbed one.

39:44.557 --> 39:46.593
And then it looked really
good, so I ate it.

39:46.594 --> 39:48.398
