01:23.208 --> 01:25.293
- Rachel, don't go in there.

01:32.759 --> 01:35.345
<i>- Angelyne?</i>

01:35.387 --> 01:37.639
You gonna come out?

01:38.848 --> 01:41.434
<i>I am not a woman.</i>

01:41.476 --> 01:44.479
- Angelyne?
<i>- I am an icon.</i>

01:44.521 --> 01:46.690
I'm not a woman.

01:48.024 --> 01:49.192
I am an icon.

01:49.234 --> 01:52.445
<i>- Angelyne?</i>

01:54.948 --> 01:56.408
- Read it.

01:57.992 --> 01:59.744
<i>- I-I don't--</i>
<i>I don't think that</i>

01:59.786 --> 02:01.413
<i>that's a very good idea.</i>
- Read it.

02:12.841 --> 02:16.386
- "Way before Paris Hilton
and Kim Kardashian,

02:16.428 --> 02:18.972
"the enigmatic
blonde bombshell

02:19.014 --> 02:21.558
"was famous for being famous,

02:21.599 --> 02:23.977
"perpetually driving
the streets of Hollywood

"in that pink Corvette.

02:26.062 --> 02:28.523
"But her true identity
has remained secret

02:28.565 --> 02:32.402
all these years...until now."

02:32.444 --> 02:34.237
<i>- I was just curious</i>
<i>about Angelyne.</i>

02:34.279 --> 02:36.281
But it can be destabilizing

02:36.322 --> 02:38.033
for the person
you're writing about.

02:38.074 --> 02:39.868
But that's the job.

02:39.909 --> 02:42.787
Sometimes they think
you love them or hate them.

02:42.829 --> 02:44.539
It's just
journalistic scrutiny.

02:44.581 --> 02:48.043
- It was
a very interesting story.

02:48.084 --> 02:50.920
I was riveted by Jeff's story.

02:50.962 --> 02:54.215
- Who is Jeff's source?

02:54.257 --> 02:56.760
No clue.
Wish I knew.

02:56.801 --> 02:58.553
Seems like a lot
of the same stuff

02:58.595 --> 03:00.930
that I found out about.

03:03.099 --> 03:05.018
I was pretty bummed.

03:07.103 --> 03:11.149
- Hi. Jeff Glaser.

03:11.191 --> 03:15.278
I think you, uh, emailed me?

03:15.320 --> 03:17.697
- I wasn't sure
you were gonna show.

03:17.739 --> 03:19.741
- I'm here.

03:27.749 --> 03:31.586
What's in this?
- Angelyne.

03:33.463 --> 03:35.632
- I'm not interested
in naked photos,

03:35.674 --> 03:38.218
if that's what this is.
- That isn't what this is.

03:38.259 --> 03:42.138
- What is it then?
- The true story of Angelyne.

03:42.180 --> 03:44.182
Different
from her public story.

03:44.224 --> 03:45.975
It's more interesting.

03:46.017 --> 03:47.852
- How'd you come by it?
- I synthesized it

03:47.894 --> 03:50.397
from a global network
of public databases.

03:50.438 --> 03:52.691
- So the internet?

03:59.906 --> 04:01.533
- It's not illegal.

04:01.574 --> 04:03.868
The way I see it, she forfeited
any claim to privacy

04:03.910 --> 04:06.496
when she ran for governor
of California.

04:11.376 --> 04:12.544
- Holy shit.

04:24.347 --> 04:27.475
- Rachel...

04:27.517 --> 04:29.811
why didn't you wake me up?

04:29.853 --> 04:31.855
We missed curfew.
We gotta go.

04:49.414 --> 04:52.667
I'll go inside with you.

04:52.709 --> 04:55.503
- It's okay.
- I'll tell them what happened.

04:55.545 --> 04:58.006
That'll just make it worse.

05:00.508 --> 05:03.553
- It was an accident.
- Doesn't matter.

05:41.716 --> 05:44.844
<i>- I think about the year</i>
<i>before we were married.</i>

05:46.179 --> 05:49.224
She was still living
at her father's house.

05:49.265 --> 05:51.059
And that entire year,

05:51.101 --> 05:53.812
<i>she never wanted me</i>
<i>to come inside.</i>

05:57.524 --> 05:59.526
<i>And at first</i>

06:01.695 --> 06:05.240
- I don't wanna read this!

06:05.281 --> 06:08.326
Why am I reading this?

06:08.368 --> 06:12.414
<i>"Copies if immigration,</i>

10:38.221 --> 10:41.307
people weren't really talking
about the Holocaust.

10:41.349 --> 10:45.270
It was too big,
too close, too awful.

a relaxed, pleasant voice.
<i>- Or too loud...</i>

11:22.932 --> 11:24.225
- Which one is Abba?

11:24.267 --> 11:26.227
<i>- Doesn't go over too well.</i>

11:26.269 --> 11:28.563
<i>And keep in mind,</i>
<i>listening is</i>

11:28.605 --> 11:30.732

- That one, I think.

11:30.774 --> 11:32.901
<i>- Than talking.</i>

11:32.942 --> 11:34.527
- That one has his eyes.

11:40.283 --> 11:42.202

11:43.870 --> 11:45.705
<i>- But keep in mind</i>
<i>some basic jewelry,</i>

11:45.747 --> 11:48.375

<i>with your skin and hair...</i>

11:48.416 --> 11:52.420

her smile like that at him.

11:52.462 --> 11:55.590
The photos, quick.
- Hurry!

11:55.632 --> 11:58.134
<i>- The way you walk is a cue</i>
<i>to your personality.</i>

11:58.176 --> 11:59.594
<i>Walk smartly.</i>

13:10.749 --> 13:12.792

13:20.383 --> 13:22.927
- Really?
- Really.

13:30.894 --> 13:33.313
- You know the photos
Abba keeps under the desk?

13:40.820 --> 13:42.781
- Why does he keep them

13:42.822 --> 13:45.408
if he doesn't want
anyone to see them?

13:51.623 --> 13:52.540
- Tell me again

13:52.582 --> 13:54.042
how you and Abba
found each other.

13:54.084 --> 13:56.753
In the camp.

13:56.795 --> 13:58.505
After the war.

13:58.546 --> 14:00.131
- That's
where you fell in love?

14:00.173 --> 14:02.425
Something like that.

14:04.219 --> 14:09.224
Your <i>tate</i>and I, we--
we both wanted the same thing.

14:09.265 --> 14:11.226
A family.

14:11.267 --> 14:14.562
At that time,
nothing else mattered.

14:14.604 --> 14:17.732
- What if you had wanted
something different?

14:17.774 --> 14:22.153
- You'll find it easier
to want the same things as men.

14:22.195 --> 14:24.698
- Easier for who?

14:24.739 --> 14:27.492
- Everyone.

14:27.534 --> 14:29.911
Hmm.
Ah--

14:29.953 --> 14:31.788
- Mama?

14:31.830 --> 14:34.958
- Mm.
Just my back.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.002
I see someone next week.

14:37.043 --> 14:38.294
- Another appointment?

14:39.963 --> 14:41.381
Now, take this off.

14:47.470 --> 14:50.140
- Do you like it?
It's for the talent show.

14:50.181 --> 14:52.267
I'm going to be Marilyn.

14:52.308 --> 14:54.811
I made it myself.

14:54.853 --> 14:56.354
It's not short.

14:59.315 --> 15:01.818
- You will look
just like her.

15:03.653 --> 15:06.906
<i>- Dr. Cohen, please come</i>
<i>to the nurses' station.</i>

15:06.948 --> 15:09.451
<i>Dr. Cohen</i>
<i>to the nurses' station.</i>

15:13.830 --> 15:16.332
- The talent show
is not until next month.

15:16.374 --> 15:20.253
- Mm?
- Parents can come.

15:20.295 --> 15:21.713
- Oh.

15:21.755 --> 15:23.757
I may have to stay
a little longer

15:23.798 --> 15:26.718
than we'd hoped.

15:26.760 --> 15:29.220
- How long?

15:29.262 --> 15:31.639
- I don't know, <i>mamashane.</i>

15:39.522 --> 15:42.317
- It's okay.
I don't--I don't--

15:42.359 --> 15:44.486
I don't really want to do
the talent show anymore.

15:44.527 --> 15:49.157
- Nonsense.
You-you will do it.

15:49.199 --> 15:52.702
And you will be wonderful.

15:57.290 --> 15:59.959
- The show must go on.

16:02.879 --> 16:04.422
- I'll see you tomorrow?

17:15.785 --> 17:18.121
- You heard your father.
<i>- "When Rachel was 15,</i>

17:36.765 --> 17:42.771
My adopted parents went to...
live in another state,

17:42.812 --> 17:45.565
and I've lost touch with them.

17:45.607 --> 17:48.651
It's a long story.
I don't want to get into it.

18:04.125 --> 18:06.086

<i>it's home, sweet home.</i>

18:53.591 --> 18:54.634

19:03.685 --> 19:06.354
Missed you.
- Just drive.

19:20.243 --> 19:23.455
- Oh, uh, watch
where you're, uh, going.

19:23.496 --> 19:25.415
- Oh, people?

19:25.457 --> 19:27.500
Oh, they don't mind.

19:27.542 --> 19:31.171
They're free
of all this nonsense.

19:34.257 --> 19:36.634

19:38.053 --> 19:39.846
- On a journey

19:39.888 --> 19:41.890
through the subconscious.

19:41.931 --> 19:42.974
- Oh.

19:43.016 --> 19:47.520
- Right over here
by Jayne Mansfield.

19:47.562 --> 19:49.147
- Okay.

19:52.734 --> 19:56.029
- Cross your legs, like this.

19:56.071 --> 19:57.072
- Okay.

19:57.113 --> 20:00.200
- And rest your palms
in your lap.

20:00.241 --> 20:02.327
- What for?

20:04.412 --> 20:06.247
- Meditating.

20:06.289 --> 20:08.208
Okay.

20:08.249 --> 20:09.876
- Back a little straighter.
- Mm-hmm.

20:09.918 --> 20:12.587
- Chin level.
Close your eyes.

20:16.716 --> 20:20.053
And now just breathe deeply.

20:20.095 --> 20:23.598
Take the mind
away from every distraction.

20:23.640 --> 20:26.017
Let thoughts float by.

20:30.021 --> 20:31.189
Really?

20:31.231 --> 20:33.274
- I thought we were meditating.

20:33.316 --> 20:34.734
- Oh, you're really funny.

20:34.776 --> 20:37.404
- Come on.

20:41.324 --> 20:42.325
Sorry.

20:44.077 --> 20:46.871
- Have you ever felt trapped?

20:49.582 --> 20:52.335
Meditation...

20:52.377 --> 20:55.255
it can un-trap you.

20:55.296 --> 20:59.884
It's like when you're pushing
on a pull door.

20:59.926 --> 21:03.847
It-it-it pulls it
from the other side.

21:03.888 --> 21:06.641
And then you can get out.

21:10.770 --> 21:13.690
- Hey.

21:13.732 --> 21:17.402
You can talk to me
about anything.

21:24.993 --> 21:28.121
- I wish I never had to
go back to that house.

21:28.163 --> 21:30.957
- I wish
you didn't have to either.

21:30.999 --> 21:33.960
- Then let's get in the car
and drive.

21:34.002 --> 21:37.339
We can go up the coast,
sleep on the beach,

21:37.380 --> 21:39.758
and never look back.

21:41.801 --> 21:44.637
- Can I maybe finish
high school first?

21:44.679 --> 21:46.556
- Forget school.

21:46.598 --> 21:49.726
It's only good for teaching you
to think like other people.

21:49.768 --> 21:53.271
Don't you want
to carve your own lane?

21:53.313 --> 21:55.982
- Look around.

21:56.024 --> 21:59.069
I think all lanes
lead to the same place.

22:02.614 --> 22:05.825
- What do you want to do then?

22:05.867 --> 22:07.994
- With the rest
of my life?

22:12.791 --> 22:15.877
I think I wanna
just spend it with you.

22:42.404 --> 22:45.615
Rachel...

22:45.657 --> 22:47.158
why didn't you wake me up?

22:47.200 --> 22:49.369
We missed curfew.
We gotta go.

23:21.609 --> 23:26.156
I'm sorry.
We fell asleep.

23:35.248 --> 23:36.708

Please don't.

23:54.976 --> 23:57.103

24:00.482 --> 24:02.776
<i>I want to stay</i>
<i>in the positive.</i>

24:02.817 --> 24:06.279
I'm okay, I'm okay,
I'm okay.

24:06.321 --> 24:09.949
<i>So if you ever feel trapped,</i>

24:09.991 --> 24:12.744
write your name
on a piece of paper

24:12.786 --> 24:15.622
and then light
the paper on fire

24:15.663 --> 24:17.999
and watch it disappear.

24:23.088 --> 24:26.508
- We got married
to get her away from them.

24:26.549 --> 24:28.802
But maybe it wasn't far enough.

24:32.055 --> 24:34.140
Who would have guessed
we'd be divorced

24:34.182 --> 24:36.184
within a year?

24:36.226 --> 24:38.520
- Now can we bring
the parents in?

24:38.561 --> 24:39.771
Eyes here.

24:42.315 --> 24:44.025
Squeeze in
just a little tighter.

24:46.194 --> 24:47.946
Now let's get one
with just the bride

24:47.987 --> 24:50.365
and her parents.

24:50.407 --> 24:53.660
<i>- I think marriage should be</i>
<i>a 24-hour agreement.</i>

24:53.702 --> 24:57.205
<i>You're married for 24 hours</i>
<i>and then it lapses out.</i>

24:57.247 --> 24:59.374
<i>And you can renew it</i>
<i>if you want,</i>

24:59.416 --> 25:05.588
but that way you're not
bound to each other or else.

25:05.630 --> 25:08.550
<i>- It was a brief marriage,</i>
<i>but done out of love.</i>

25:10.093 --> 25:12.929
It got her
out of the house at least.

25:12.971 --> 25:15.306
<i>She moved in with me and</i>
<i>my family in Beverly Hills.</i>

25:15.348 --> 25:17.267
<i>She changed schools.</i>

25:17.308 --> 25:19.561
<i>Why she'd leave,</i>
<i>I'll never know.</i>

25:21.646 --> 25:24.691
She seemed...happy.

25:34.701 --> 25:36.411
- What are we doing here?

25:36.453 --> 25:38.705
- We're late
for Leah's birthday dinner.

25:51.343 --> 25:53.887
I know what this is,
and I'm not going in there.

25:53.928 --> 25:55.221
- Rachel...
- Mm-mm.

25:55.263 --> 25:58.683
- I just want to understand
why you left me.

25:58.725 --> 26:00.643
Was it this night?

26:00.685 --> 26:02.979
The night
you and your dad argued?

26:03.021 --> 26:04.856
You just don't get it.

26:06.024 --> 26:08.401
- It's okay.

26:08.443 --> 26:11.154
It already happened.

26:11.196 --> 26:13.490
We're already there.

26:17.827 --> 26:20.747
- Danny, baby,
let's go to the beach.

26:20.789 --> 26:22.248
Come on, honey.
- He called you

26:22.290 --> 26:24.250
a bitch or something, and I--

26:24.292 --> 26:25.585
I should have told him
that he couldn't

26:25.627 --> 26:28.088
talk to you like that.
Was that it?

26:28.129 --> 26:29.506
- It wasn't one thing
or the other.

26:29.547 --> 26:31.091
Come on.
Let's go hear some music.

26:31.132 --> 26:33.176
- Okay, just-just a sec.
Just a sec.

26:33.218 --> 26:35.428
- Come on, come on.
Give me the keys.

26:35.470 --> 26:37.305
Let's start the car.
I wanna go.

26:37.347 --> 26:39.557
I wanna go.
I wanna go!

26:39.599 --> 26:41.351
- He went to hit you.

26:41.393 --> 26:42.435
- I didn't know
how to throw a punch,

26:42.477 --> 26:44.270
so I-I grabbed a lamp,

26:44.312 --> 26:45.814
and I went to Eli
and I said,

26:45.855 --> 26:49.150
"Do not hit her.
I will not stand for that."

26:50.694 --> 26:53.947
And-and-
and we just walked out.

26:53.988 --> 26:55.532
I protected you.

26:55.573 --> 26:58.451
I protected
you.

26:59.994 --> 27:01.663
See? I--

27:10.714 --> 27:13.800
<i>- When was the last time</i>
<i>I saw Rachel?</i>

27:13.842 --> 27:17.679
<i>I knew</i>
<i>you were gonna ask me that.</i>

27:17.721 --> 27:21.850
<i>Honestly, I can't remember.</i>

27:21.891 --> 27:23.143
<i>She had a way going</i>

27:23.184 --> 27:26.354
shht...
the world is gone.

27:26.396 --> 27:28.231
She just turns it off

27:28.273 --> 27:30.483
and goes
into one of her fantasies.

27:32.110 --> 27:35.572
Whenever she's done
with something, she's done.

27:35.613 --> 27:38.575
I mean, I looked for her.
I tried.

27:38.616 --> 27:41.745
Even her sister
had no idea where she was.

27:41.786 --> 27:44.622
She just...

27:44.664 --> 27:46.458
disappeared.

28:09.647 --> 28:12.817
<i>All the religions basically</i>
<i>come from the same idea.</i>

28:12.859 --> 28:16.863
<i>It's always the struggle</i>
<i>between dark and light.</i>

28:18.740 --> 28:22.744
I choose to go
for the light.

28:22.786 --> 28:25.288
Mm-hmm.

28:25.330 --> 28:28.750
<i>And that's why I win</i>
<i>in the end.</i>

32:23.526 --> 32:25.236
- You're here.

32:28.823 --> 32:31.493
- Who are you?

32:31.534 --> 32:38.041
- I am you is me is we.

32:40.919 --> 32:43.129
- Where are we?

32:43.171 --> 32:47.092
- A place
of painless existence.

32:47.926 --> 32:49.969
You sit there.

33:01.898 --> 33:05.360
Don't worry.
You'll know what to do.

33:11.199 --> 33:13.743
<i>Really.</i>
<i>- Oh, we're on TV here.</i>

33:13.785 --> 33:17.956
<i>- Angelyne, we're just dying</i>
<i>to know about you.</i>

33:23.837 --> 33:26.339
<i>- Look at</i>
<i>all these cute guys.</i>

33:26.381 --> 33:28.758
<i>- The rest of us</i>
<i>work for a living.</i>

33:28.800 --> 33:30.385
<i>- Hey. Hey, Angelyne,</i>

33:30.427 --> 33:32.220
<i>I think you're gonna fall</i>
<i>out of that dress.</i>

33:32.262 --> 33:34.222
<i>- There's so much suffering</i>
<i>in the world,</i>

33:34.264 --> 33:38.518
<i>and I am a divine,</i>
<i>sex goddess presence</i>

33:38.560 --> 33:41.187
<i>for the world to discover.</i>

34:09.507 --> 34:11.259
<i>Ooh.</i>

34:59.891 --> 35:03.311
<i>You might think you've solved</i>
<i>some kind of mystery,</i>

35:03.353 --> 35:06.064
But that doesn't mean
there's no mystery left.

35:06.106 --> 35:07.899
I still have mystique.

35:07.941 --> 35:10.443
I'm still intense.
I'm still a sex goddess.

35:10.485 --> 35:14.364
And that is never gonna change,
because that is just who I am.

35:23.790 --> 35:27.043
- People were meant to have
their fantasies taken away.

35:27.085 --> 35:28.628
It's a beautiful tragedy.

35:28.670 --> 35:31.965
The sad things, to me,
don't take away, they deepen.

35:38.138 --> 35:41.599
<i>Just as LA is far more</i>
<i>complicated and darker</i>

35:41.641 --> 35:43.977
<i>than people give it</i>
<i>credit for elsewhere,</i>

35:44.019 --> 35:46.563
<i>so too is Angelyne.</i>

35:52.068 --> 35:53.987
- I, uh, have a call in
to all our attorneys.

35:54.029 --> 35:55.947
He won't get away with this.

35:59.492 --> 36:01.661
<i>- Thank you</i>
<i>for calling Angelyne.</i>

36:01.703 --> 36:03.580
<i>You can leave</i>
<i>a magnificent message.</i>

36:03.621 --> 36:06.041
<i>- Hello, Angelyne.</i>

36:06.082 --> 36:07.709
<i>This is Carrie Jacobs</i>
<i>from NPR.</i>

36:07.751 --> 36:09.461
<i>We'd love for you</i>
<i>to come on "Air Talk"</i>

36:09.502 --> 36:11.796
<i>and respond to the recent</i>
<i>"Hollywood Reporter" article.</i>

36:11.838 --> 36:14.424
<i>The response to the article</i>
<i>has been off the charts.</i>

36:14.466 --> 36:15.842
<i>- Hey, Angelyne.</i>

36:15.884 --> 36:17.052
<i>I think that reporter</i>
<i>should leave you alone.</i>

36:17.093 --> 36:18.386
<i>You want me to tell him that?</i>

36:18.428 --> 36:19.679
<i>- Angelyne,</i>

36:19.721 --> 36:21.222
<i>you're one of Hollywood's</i>
<i>greatest icons.</i>

36:21.264 --> 36:22.515
<i>I don't care</i>
<i>what that press says.</i>

36:22.557 --> 36:24.017
<i>- Hey, Angelyne,</i>

36:24.059 --> 36:25.560
<i>I read what that guy</i>
<i>wrote about you.</i>

36:25.602 --> 36:27.228
<i>Keep your head up.</i>
<i>Keep spreading love.</i>

36:27.270 --> 36:28.730
<i>It doesn't matter</i>
<i>who you grew up as</i>

36:28.772 --> 36:30.940
<i>or what you went through.</i>
<i>You're Angelyne!</i>

36:35.945 --> 36:37.697
- The thing is,

36:37.739 --> 36:42.118
the mystery
will never be solved.

36:42.160 --> 36:43.953
That's just the way it is.

36:43.995 --> 36:48.917
There's always more.
And more.

36:48.958 --> 36:51.252
And more.

36:51.294 --> 36:54.297
T-shirt
and join the fan club, okay?

36:54.339 --> 36:57.217
- Angelyne?
- Picture? A picture is 35.

36:57.258 --> 36:58.927
Here's a hat.

36:58.968 --> 37:00.553
Please, just don't--

37:00.595 --> 37:02.389
no, don't touch
the merchandise.

37:02.430 --> 37:04.933
You're so cute.
There you go.

37:04.974 --> 37:06.601
And I have a magnet.

37:06.643 --> 37:09.187
You want a hat?
Do you want a pink hat?

37:09.229 --> 37:11.231
You want to put that money
right in here.

37:11.272 --> 37:12.732
<i>- The things she said</i>
<i>addressing</i>

37:12.774 --> 37:14.359
<i>the "Hollywood Reporter"</i>
<i>story,</i>

37:14.401 --> 37:17.570
her interview for this--

37:17.612 --> 37:18.863
that's probably
the closest I'll get

37:18.905 --> 37:20.824
to her commenting on mine.

37:22.283 --> 37:24.202
That might be it.

37:24.244 --> 37:27.580
- It's just a part
of being famous.

37:27.622 --> 37:30.875
I come with a set of rumors.

37:30.917 --> 37:36.214
But who I am is Angelyne--
inside, outside.

37:36.256 --> 37:40.844
As far as any facts go...

37:43.013 --> 37:45.306
I'm gonna write my own story.

37:45.348 --> 37:49.769
This...isn't it.

37:49.811 --> 37:52.147
<i>- She's happy</i>
<i>selling out of her car.</i>

37:52.188 --> 37:56.151
She wants the adulation.
She needs it.

37:56.192 --> 37:58.319
I mean, she-she's
giving rides to strangers

37:58.361 --> 37:59.654
in her car for money.

37:59.696 --> 38:01.197
I-I wouldn't trust
that shit.

38:01.239 --> 38:02.907
H--how do you know
that guy is not gonna

38:02.949 --> 38:04.617
hit you over the head,
steal your car,

38:04.659 --> 38:07.620
and-and-and toss
your headless body somewhere?

38:11.666 --> 38:14.919
- What made her
become Angelyne?

38:14.961 --> 38:18.214
Honestly, I don't know.

38:18.256 --> 38:21.509
It's a persona
that must have suited her.

38:21.551 --> 38:24.679
- Well, Angelyne the character
is Angelyne the person.

38:24.721 --> 38:25.764
Definitely.

38:25.805 --> 38:29.893
She is as you see her
in real life.

38:29.934 --> 38:31.603
I guarantee you that.

39:09.265 --> 39:11.351
Ooh.

39:13.728 --> 39:16.231
I don't want to deny it all

39:16.272 --> 39:19.275
so that I don't get
the sympathy and the empathy

39:19.317 --> 39:21.778
that the article gave me,
but...

39:24.447 --> 39:29.703
I did have...
a lot of challenges

39:29.744 --> 39:34.624
to dig Angelyne out of who
she supposedly was born as.

39:36.126 --> 39:38.962
<i>But all the details</i>
<i>are not true.</i>

39:39.004 --> 39:42.382
<i>But what I represent</i>
<i>to Hollywood</i>

39:42.424 --> 39:44.926
<i>and who I am...</i>

39:44.968 --> 39:48.722
that's who I really am
inside, outside.

39:48.763 --> 39:51.224
And my looks reflect
from the inside,

39:51.266 --> 39:53.435
not the outside.

39:53.476 --> 39:56.646
I'm for real.
Ooh.

39:59.274 --> 40:01.568
- And cut.
- How was that?

40:04.070 --> 40:07.615
Hello? Hello?

40:07.657 --> 40:10.076
Hello!
<i>- Emmy, stand by.</i>

40:10.118 --> 40:11.244
<i>We're trying</i>
<i>to locate Angelyne.</i>

40:11.286 --> 40:13.413
- Oh, God damn it.
Ang?

40:16.499 --> 40:18.460
<i>What more do you want?</i>

40:18.501 --> 40:20.920
<i>- I've got tote bags.</i>

40:20.962 --> 40:23.506
<i>- I thought there was</i>
<i>supposed to be a cameo.</i>

40:25.342 --> 40:28.720
<i>Hello?</i>

40:28.762 --> 40:29.679
<i>An--</i>

40:33.641 --> 40:37.854
<i>- It's so much fun</i>
<i>being famous for nothing.</i>

40:37.896 --> 40:39.439
<i>What do you do?</i>
<i>It's like...</i>

40:39.481 --> 40:40.690
<i>Whether the story</i>
<i>is true or not,</i>

40:40.732 --> 40:41.941
<i>everybody got challenges</i>

40:41.983 --> 40:43.651
<i>and it affects them</i>
<i>differently.</i>

40:43.693 --> 40:45.195
<i>I'm a rebel.</i>
<i>I'm not an actress.</i>

40:45.236 --> 40:46.863
<i>I inspire people.</i>

40:46.905 --> 40:49.157
<i>If someone could do me in</i>
<i>a movie, which I would hate,</i>

40:49.199 --> 40:51.368
<i>'cause nobody</i>
<i>has that kind of energy,</i>

40:51.409 --> 40:52.660
<i>it's part of show business.</i>

40:52.702 --> 40:54.245
<i>And, you know,</i>
<i>what can I say?</i>

40:54.287 --> 40:55.580
<i>Facts aren't always right.</i>

40:55.622 --> 40:58.166
<i>LA, I love you!</i>
<i>Ooh!</i>

41:08.218 --> 41:11.596
- Could you back up?
I need to get some unleaded.

41:25.110 --> 41:26.569
- I'm a billboard star.

41:26.611 --> 41:29.322
I'm a--
I'm a Hollywood sex goddess.

41:29.364 --> 41:30.865
I'm a glamor queen.

41:30.907 --> 41:33.201
Um, what else
do I need to do?

41:43.169 --> 41:44.796
- I was just wondering,
how--what--

41:44.838 --> 41:46.089
You know, how big are you?

41:46.131 --> 41:48.049
I mean, what's your,
you know, measurements?

41:48.091 --> 41:49.884
- If you want to know that,
you'll have to come

41:49.926 --> 41:52.387
all the way to Hollywood
and measure me.

41:52.429 --> 41:54.347
Ooh!
