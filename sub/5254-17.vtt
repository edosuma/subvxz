Hey!

17:00.294 --> 17:03.269
Tommy, you begged,
you pleaded.

17:03.304 --> 17:06.608
And I, being the forgiving,
benevolent person I am,

17:06.777 --> 17:09.944
have decided to give you
a shot at redemption.

17:10.038 --> 17:12.682
Yes, I will go to
prom with you.

17:12.717 --> 17:14.058
Unless anyone
has any objections

17:14.093 --> 17:16.069
they'd like to voice.

17:16.104 --> 17:18.339
Lauren, you will not
regret this.

17:18.439 --> 17:20.308
And if you follow
this checklist, I won't.

17:20.409 --> 17:21.877
You might want to call
the florist now.

17:21.976 --> 17:24.780
The orchids I want in my corsage
are very rare.

[phone beeping]

17:27.215 --> 17:29.185
- Hello.
- Two tickets, please.

17:29.284 --> 17:32.321
One for me,
and one for Fred here.

17:32.420 --> 17:34.188
Turner said we have
to have dates.

17:34.288 --> 17:35.790
He didn't say
they have to be alive.

17:35.890 --> 17:37.792
It might be against God.

17:37.892 --> 17:40.147
But it's not against the rules.

17:40.182 --> 17:41.250
Thank you.

17:41.285 --> 17:44.096
Come on, Freddy.

17:44.131 --> 17:45.467
Sorry.

17:45.566 --> 17:48.695
Sasha, uh, what are you doing
here again?

17:48.730 --> 17:51.631
Oh, I stopped by the office
and they are just desperate

17:51.666 --> 17:53.089
for substitute teachers.

17:53.124 --> 17:54.612
All you need is
a college diploma.

17:54.647 --> 17:56.727
- Crazy, right?
- Oh, wow.

17:56.828 --> 17:59.434
And I can't wait to teach you
a thing or two.

17:59.469 --> 18:00.632
[laughs]

18:02.332 --> 18:06.592
So, um, why did you tell
Karma I asked you

18:06.627 --> 18:08.342
when you asked me?

18:08.377 --> 18:09.342
I did?

18:09.377 --> 18:11.804
Oh, it all happened so fast.

18:11.839 --> 18:14.203
What's the difference, really?

18:14.238 --> 18:16.774
I'm sensing something else
is going on here.

18:16.809 --> 18:18.954
Is this... is this prom thing
really a date,

18:18.989 --> 18:21.453
or is it some sort
of weird scheme?

18:21.552 --> 18:23.816
[sighs]

18:23.851 --> 18:25.591
Okay.

18:25.691 --> 18:27.890
The truth
is I asked you

18:27.925 --> 18:30.820
because I can't go
to prom with Karma.

18:30.855 --> 18:32.288
I used to be in love
with her

18:32.323 --> 18:35.099
and I can't go down
that rabbit hole again.

18:35.134 --> 18:37.035
Oh.

18:37.070 --> 18:40.905
Yeah, that makes sense,
I guess.

18:41.151 --> 18:44.072
But I didn't want to go
to prom in the first place.

18:44.107 --> 18:47.345
And I'm not sure if I want to go
as your feelings air-bag.

18:47.444 --> 18:48.847
Yeah. You're right.

18:48.946 --> 18:51.550
And I appreciate you
calling me on that.

18:51.649 --> 18:54.451
It kind of makes me
want to go with you more.

18:54.551 --> 18:57.188
But just so you don't
have to go with Karma.

18:57.289 --> 18:58.525
Yeah.

18:58.560 --> 19:00.032
Well, partially.

19:00.067 --> 19:02.961
But also,
you seem like a cool guy.

19:03.016 --> 19:05.457
And we both hate prom.

19:05.492 --> 19:07.774
And making fun of
the whole thing with you

19:07.809 --> 19:09.927
might make it
almost bearable.

19:09.962 --> 19:12.963
Well, I do admire your sarcasm.

19:13.058 --> 19:15.238
Yeah. Yeah, let's do it.

19:15.273 --> 19:16.709
And hey, now that
the pressure's off,

19:16.744 --> 19:19.211
I don't even have to shower!

19:19.246 --> 19:20.985
Look, I'm not one
for playing games.

19:21.079 --> 19:22.858
So I'm just gonna say it.

19:22.893 --> 19:25.180
Will you go to prom with...

- What, did you raid

the Drama Club
costume department?

19:32.874 --> 19:34.765
Karma, you look...

19:34.839 --> 19:36.875
- Wow.
- Thanks.

19:37.012 --> 19:39.154
And I just want to say,
I'm totally open-minded

19:39.189 --> 19:41.089
about the whole "bi" thing.

19:41.124 --> 19:42.866

said dates were mandatory.
