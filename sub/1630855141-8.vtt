WEBVTT

00:11.178 --> 00:12.554
Where are we going?

00:13.138 --> 00:17.226
Not much further, Bean. Okay.

00:22.689 --> 00:24.274
You said you'd be on time.

00:26.026 --> 00:27.027
And alone.

00:27.027 --> 00:28.946
My daughter can keep a secret.

00:29.655 --> 00:32.073
Unless you'd rather I find another
taker for these.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.670
You get caught,
I'm gonna say you found it.

00:45.254 --> 00:46.380
No one's getting caught.

00:46.380 --> 00:49.842
Don't be so sure. The Silo always wins.

01:06.441 --> 01:07.526
I can carry it.

01:09.069 --> 01:10.612
Okay.

01:12.030 --> 01:13.115
You got me a rabbit?

01:14.366 --> 01:15.993
It's not a pet, okay?

01:18.036 --> 01:21.957
- We're not gonna eat it.
- No, we're not gonna eat it.

01:23.792 --> 01:25.961
It's barely moving. I think it's sick.

01:27.129 --> 01:28.463
That's the point, Bean.

01:51.195 --> 01:52.696
We're not looking for a baby.

02:03.373 --> 02:04.750
Please.

02:05.834 --> 02:07.336
Won't be much longer.

02:07.336 --> 02:09.170
Come on, I need to sleep.

02:09.170 --> 02:10.380
I know.

02:10.380 --> 02:12.049
I can't stay in here.

02:13.425 --> 02:14.510
Miss Hildebrandt.

02:29.942 --> 02:32.444
You weren't very cooperative
with my agents.

02:41.036 --> 02:44.248
I hope you'll be more cooperative
with me, Gloria.

02:47.376 --> 02:50.003
You're the security man.

02:51.255 --> 02:53.090
Your wife had a miscarriage.

02:53.590 --> 02:54.842
Your memory is sharp.

02:56.093 --> 02:57.553
That bodes well for us.

02:57.553 --> 03:02.140
You two were about to give up on a family,
but you still had time on your lottery.

03:02.140 --> 03:04.685
And then I got you some f...

03:05.185 --> 03:07.646
- Folic acid.
- Folic acid. That's it.

03:07.646 --> 03:10.274
One drop in her tea every night.
Did it work?

03:10.274 --> 03:12.609
Our boy turns six next month.

03:17.364 --> 03:18.365
I need your help.

03:20.492 --> 03:23.161
If you cooperate
and give me what I'm looking for,

03:23.161 --> 03:26.874
I'll personally guarantee
you're never kept from your dreams again.

03:28.458 --> 03:29.626
If I don't help you?

03:31.211 --> 03:33.380
You gonna send an old woman out to clean?

03:34.006 --> 03:35.007
No.

03:35.841 --> 03:37.551
I'll leave her in this room unmedicated

03:37.551 --> 03:41.305
to spend the rest of her days
staring at these walls.

03:42.973 --> 03:44.641
Why should I trust you?

03:45.642 --> 03:48.562
Because thanks to you, I have my son.

03:51.523 --> 03:54.359
I take no pleasure
in putting you in this position.

03:55.068 --> 03:58.947
But now the situation
is of grave importance to the Silo.

03:59.823 --> 04:03.076
Juliette Nichols paid you a visit.

04:03.660 --> 04:05.245
Took something out of that vent.

04:07.206 --> 04:08.957
I need to know what that was.

04:12.336 --> 04:13.337
A bag.

04:14.296 --> 04:16.173
Did Sheriff Holston hide it in there?

04:18.884 --> 04:19.718
Yes.

04:20.636 --> 04:22.137
What was inside the bag?

04:45.702 --> 04:48.622
Give her the good stuff.
Every dose, every day.

04:49.540 --> 04:51.458
Anyone try to pull her out,
they go through me.

04:52.042 --> 04:53.043
Yes, sir.

04:57.798 --> 04:59.633
Thank you, Miss Hildebrandt.

05:00.926 --> 05:01.927
For everything.

05:04.263 --> 05:06.807
Do you really think you'll win?

05:10.894 --> 05:12.271
We have to.

07:06.385 --> 07:08.846
Cameras had her on the stairs
below here going down,

07:08.846 --> 07:10.472
but then we lost her.

07:12.140 --> 07:14.184
Stair coverage gets pretty spotty
below Medical.

07:14.184 --> 07:17.396
When you find her, secure her.
She has a red-level relic with her.

07:17.396 --> 07:19.273
Tell your team nobody touches it.

07:19.273 --> 07:20.357
Yes, sir.

08:16.163 --> 08:17.414
What's gonna happen?

08:17.414 --> 08:20.250
Well, I think there could be
a small hole in his heart.

08:20.250 --> 08:21.835
- Like Jacob had?
- Yeah.

08:22.920 --> 08:26.089
And I'm gonna find it and sew it up.

08:26.089 --> 08:28.175
- How are you gonna see it?
- With this.

08:30.260 --> 08:31.929
All right, bring him over.

08:46.568 --> 08:48.737
Now, this next part's gonna be scary.

08:49.321 --> 08:52.241
- Are you sure you want to stay?
- Yeah, I wanna watch it all.

08:52.824 --> 08:53.825
Okay, then.

09:03.710 --> 09:05.838
You wanna see his heart?

09:07.047 --> 09:08.048
Come on, then.

09:12.553 --> 09:14.346
It's gigantic.

09:14.346 --> 09:16.849
My darling Bean, this is a magnifier.

09:17.474 --> 09:21.311
It's the first one in the Silo.
It makes tiny things appear big.

09:21.311 --> 09:25.816
Now, if this works,
we can use it to help other people.

09:31.738 --> 09:32.823
Okay.

09:35.492 --> 09:37.202
<i>Billings to Sheriff.</i>

09:40.622 --> 09:42.374
<i>Billings to Sheriff.</i>

09:46.461 --> 09:47.546
What is it, Billings?

09:48.130 --> 09:49.965
<i>You need to come to the office.</i>

10:04.438 --> 10:06.356
Hey! What the fuck are you doing?

10:06.356 --> 10:09.484
- You need to wait here until we finish.
- No. This is our office.

10:10.277 --> 10:11.403
How can they do this?

10:11.403 --> 10:14.448
Meadows ordered a search
for unregistered relics.

10:14.448 --> 10:15.532
What?

10:16.491 --> 10:18.368
Sounds like a load of rat shit to me.

10:18.368 --> 10:20.829
The real question is why she did it.

10:20.829 --> 10:22.581
Why are you looking at me? I don't know.

10:22.581 --> 10:24.917
Sims took the last relic.
I don't think anything's come in since.

10:24.917 --> 10:27.836
Uh-huh. What happened at your little visit
with her yesterday?

10:27.836 --> 10:30.506
Nothing happened. I brought her eggs
and bacon like you said.

10:30.506 --> 10:31.924
She's sick as a dog.

10:32.633 --> 10:35.177
Hey! Take it easy, Howey.

10:35.177 --> 10:38.138
You realize this is a blatant violation
of the Pact, right?

10:38.138 --> 10:42.976
Law enforcement premises cannot be
searched without extreme probable cause.

10:44.019 --> 10:45.854
Do you hear what I'm saying?

10:59.701 --> 11:02.079
Make sure you check under the flooring.

11:09.920 --> 11:11.630
Do you know how lost I felt?

11:12.130 --> 11:14.633
This was the one thing that I could do.

11:14.633 --> 11:20.305
Imagine if we'd had something like this
for Jacob. We-- I mean, we could...

11:21.807 --> 11:26.937
All I want is to stop other families
from going through the same thing.

11:26.937 --> 11:28.730
You don't think I felt lost too?

11:29.231 --> 11:32.025
But that doesn't mean you can start
making unsanctioned devices.

11:32.025 --> 11:35.779
That device could help fix heart defects.
It could save lives.

11:35.779 --> 11:38.365
Why is a magnifier even illegal
in the first place?

11:38.365 --> 11:40.117
I don't know, but there are rules.

11:40.117 --> 11:42.119
You're good at following rules.
I'll give you that.

11:42.119 --> 11:44.538
- What's that supposed to mean?
- No one else knew what I was doing

11:44.538 --> 11:45.664
besides you and Jules.

11:45.664 --> 11:47.749
What, you think I told Judicial?

11:47.749 --> 11:51.003
I'm sure there's something in the Pact
about reporting your family.

11:51.003 --> 11:53.005
How can you even suggest that?

11:53.005 --> 11:54.840
How else could they have known?

11:54.840 --> 11:57.968
Because there are fucking whisperers
everywhere!

11:58.719 --> 11:59.970
You haven't exactly been subtle.

11:59.970 --> 12:01.889
Glass and metal deliveries to our door,

12:01.889 --> 12:03.807
taking our daughter to the farm
after hours.

12:05.142 --> 12:07.644
Please, Hanna.
Just give them what they want

12:07.644 --> 12:09.813
before they tear down our entire home.

12:10.689 --> 12:12.608
Juliette's room is-- Please.

12:13.859 --> 12:16.737
I hope whatever you're getting out
of this is worth it.

12:20.616 --> 12:21.450
Stop.

12:22.910 --> 12:24.161
I'll give it to you.

12:25.454 --> 12:26.455
Stand down.

12:48.060 --> 12:49.061
What is all this?

13:24.012 --> 13:25.180
No!

13:34.022 --> 13:35.607
Now the animal.

13:37.818 --> 13:39.027
Tell us where it is,

13:39.027 --> 13:41.280
and we'll drop the charges
against the farmer.

13:42.948 --> 13:43.949
It died.

13:44.616 --> 13:47.035
We ate the meat, composted the rest.

13:51.248 --> 13:54.710
The Judicial Department thanks you
for your time and your cooperation.

14:07.764 --> 14:10.684
I swear to you, I didn't.

14:17.608 --> 14:20.235
It's okay. I've got this.

15:03.529 --> 15:05.489
- We need to check that.
- That's not gonna happen.

15:09.159 --> 15:10.160
Little help here?

15:11.703 --> 15:13.330
Are you fucking kidding me?

15:13.830 --> 15:14.831
Fine.

15:24.258 --> 15:25.968
There. You happy, asshole?

15:38.272 --> 15:39.273
Let's go.

15:48.699 --> 15:50.117
And you used to work with these people?

15:50.117 --> 15:53.495
I was in administration, not one
of these overcompensating fuckwads.

15:55.038 --> 15:56.081
What? I cuss.

15:57.457 --> 15:59.710
Either way, this doesn't feel
like a regular toss and turn.

15:59.710 --> 16:01.378
- This feels--
- No, this is personal.

16:02.588 --> 16:03.589
Fuck.

16:04.548 --> 16:06.633
Meadows didn't do this.
She's not behind this.

16:07.176 --> 16:09.386
- She signed the warrant.
- No, when I was there,

16:10.470 --> 16:12.181
something didn't feel right.

16:12.181 --> 16:14.308
I don't think she's the one
calling the shots.

16:15.058 --> 16:17.436
- Then who is?
- Sims.

16:18.228 --> 16:19.313
- Robert?
- Yeah.

16:19.313 --> 16:21.356
He enforces the Pact.
He's not some power-hungry--

16:21.356 --> 16:24.026
No, he's wanted to get rid of me
ever since I arrived.

16:24.026 --> 16:26.695
This here, this is just a warm-up.

16:26.695 --> 16:29.865
He's not gonna stop until I'm either
in that cell or over the fucking rail.

16:32.451 --> 16:33.535
Fuck.

16:33.535 --> 16:36.330
You said this was an illegal search
and seizure, right?

16:38.832 --> 16:40.667
They skipped about ten steps.

16:40.667 --> 16:43.170
There should have been an initial notice,
a request for evidence--

16:43.170 --> 16:45.506
- You're coming with me to Judicial.
- To do what?

16:47.758 --> 16:49.843
Does this look like a hard drive to you?

16:52.012 --> 16:53.013
No, sir.

16:53.931 --> 16:54.932
How about this?

16:55.516 --> 16:58.560
- Does it plug into a computer?
- No, sir.

16:58.560 --> 17:02.314
Did the warrant say to bring back
useless fucking office supplies?

17:02.314 --> 17:03.565
That's all we found in her office.

17:03.565 --> 17:05.817
Then you didn't look hard enough!

17:06.859 --> 17:08.069
New plan.

17:09.570 --> 17:13.367
I want you to find every porter
who worked between level one and 50.

17:13.367 --> 17:16.578
Find out if she handed off anything
or talked to anyone. That's what--

17:16.578 --> 17:18.413
I'm sorry. I tried to stop them.

17:18.413 --> 17:20.207
Miss Nichols,
you can't just barge into my...

17:20.207 --> 17:21.834
- Robert Sims, you're under arrest.
- ...office like this.

17:21.834 --> 17:23.669
Wait, this is about your office.

17:23.669 --> 17:25.587
- I told Meadows you'd be pissed--
- Fuck Meadows.

17:25.587 --> 17:28.131
You're under arrest
for breaking Pact investigation protocol.

17:28.131 --> 17:30.592
- What, are we making up crimes now?
- Deputy Billings.

17:30.592 --> 17:33.053
Section 14, subsection three,
paragraph 12B.

17:33.053 --> 17:37.015
- And illegal search and seizure.
- Section 23, subsection 19, paragraph six.

17:37.015 --> 17:39.893
All those Pact Bees you won
while you were a kid

17:40.435 --> 17:42.396
finally paid off, huh, Paul?

17:42.980 --> 17:44.231
Seems that way.

17:44.231 --> 17:46.900
Miss Nichols, I had nothing
to do with that search order.

17:46.900 --> 17:49.319
Your agents broke protocol,
and I'm holding you responsible.

17:49.319 --> 17:51.405
You don't like it,
you can take it up with Meadows.

17:51.405 --> 17:52.865
Cuff him and take him upstairs.

17:56.076 --> 17:58.078
Are you sure you want to do this?

17:58.579 --> 18:00.914
Want's got nothing to do with it.
She's the boss.

18:03.959 --> 18:04.960
For the moment.

18:12.926 --> 18:15.345
Take all this back upstairs
and put it where you found it.

18:16.180 --> 18:19.766
Hey! Do you wanna join your boss in jail?
I've got more cuffs.

18:20.934 --> 18:23.770
- You'll regret this.
- I doubt that.

18:29.860 --> 18:32.529
Great. Place better look like you
were never there.

20:06.957 --> 20:08.208
Jules?

20:09.209 --> 20:10.210
Is everything okay?

20:12.212 --> 20:14.214
Why didn't you want mom
to build a magnifier?

20:16.800 --> 20:19.511
Look, I know you have
very strong feelings about--

20:19.511 --> 20:21.722
No, I wanna know why she killed herself.

20:21.722 --> 20:24.308
I know I wasn't willing to listen before.
I am now.

20:24.308 --> 20:26.852
I really need to know.

20:40.032 --> 20:41.700
Wasn't about the magnifier.

20:42.367 --> 20:43.368
What do you mean?

20:45.996 --> 20:47.247
A couple of times a year,

20:47.247 --> 20:52.085
I have to break the news to a young,
happy couple that their newborn has died.

20:53.337 --> 20:54.505
It's my job.

20:55.339 --> 20:56.840
But it's not the hardest part.

20:57.591 --> 21:00.844
The hardest is running into that father
and mother in the years after

21:00.844 --> 21:02.513
and seeing what it's done to them.

21:03.680 --> 21:06.099
Loss affects people differently.

21:06.099 --> 21:10.854
Sometimes it shrinks your world,
draws you inward.

21:11.522 --> 21:14.358
And that's how it was for me
after we lost your brother.

21:15.275 --> 21:17.069
I spent a lot more time in here

21:17.069 --> 21:19.655
when I should have been there
for you and your mother.

21:21.532 --> 21:23.033
I'll always regret that.

21:24.117 --> 21:25.118
And I'm sorry.

21:31.667 --> 21:33.210
But your mother...

21:35.128 --> 21:38.715
grief turned her outward,
pushed her toward dangerous things.

21:39.800 --> 21:41.301
She so desperately wanted answers,

21:41.301 --> 21:44.054
she stopped caring about the lines
she had to cross to get them.

21:44.054 --> 21:45.722
But she still wanted to help people.

21:45.722 --> 21:47.891
And I wanted to help her, protect her.

21:47.891 --> 21:49.226
That's all I cared about.

21:49.226 --> 21:51.645
Not the magnifier. Not anything else.

21:54.481 --> 21:55.858
But it wasn't enough.

21:58.318 --> 21:59.570
I should have stopped them...

22:01.446 --> 22:04.992
Judicial, when they came into our home.

22:06.493 --> 22:10.289
I should have done something
besides bowing to their will.

22:12.499 --> 22:18.630
When those agents crushed her machine,
they crushed her spirit.

22:21.133 --> 22:26.430
And I tried to bring her back,
but she didn't wanna listen to me.

22:27.181 --> 22:28.557
I gave up.

22:31.935 --> 22:33.395
I failed her.

22:36.940 --> 22:39.318
That's why I left you in Mechanical.

22:41.778 --> 22:44.865
You're like your mom
in so many ways, Jules.

22:46.033 --> 22:49.119
When you went down there, it wrecked me.

22:49.912 --> 22:52.706
But I knew it was for the best,
even if it meant you'd hate me.

22:52.706 --> 22:54.333
I knew that down there,

22:54.333 --> 22:59.129
you could put your talent
into fixing real things in front of you

22:59.129 --> 23:02.341
instead of chasing impossible answers
like your mother did.

23:04.051 --> 23:05.427
And yet here I am.

23:07.304 --> 23:08.514
Here you are.

23:10.432 --> 23:12.184
And she blamed you, you know?

23:13.936 --> 23:16.230
She thought you had reported her.
I did too.

23:16.230 --> 23:20.150
I know. And I swear to you, I never. Ever.

23:20.150 --> 23:21.610
No, I know.

23:22.778 --> 23:27.032
Judicial, they were watching Mom
with sensors through the mirrors.

23:27.032 --> 23:28.492
I found her file.

23:28.492 --> 23:31.411
- What do you mean?
- They have their own cameras.

23:31.411 --> 23:34.122
That's-- And they listen,
not just with porters and other people,

23:34.122 --> 23:35.207
they have devices.

23:35.207 --> 23:37.251
That's how they knew about the magnifier.

23:37.835 --> 23:39.545
That's how they know everything.

23:42.756 --> 23:44.424
She never believed me.

23:44.424 --> 23:46.093
I know.

23:46.718 --> 23:47.803
I do.

23:48.929 --> 23:50.764
Oh, Juliette.

23:56.353 --> 23:58.772
I know. I'm so sorry.

24:00.065 --> 24:01.608
I still miss her so much.

24:03.485 --> 24:04.486
I do too.

24:09.283 --> 24:11.493
- Sorry to interrupt.
- It's okay.

24:11.493 --> 24:12.953
Maintenance is here.

24:14.538 --> 24:18.125
- What for?
- Something about checking the vents.

24:18.125 --> 24:19.793
He's very insistent.

24:21.712 --> 24:24.673
- Did you send for a work order?
- No.

24:24.673 --> 24:26.008
- Did you?
- No.

24:27.551 --> 24:29.303
Can you tell him to come back later?

24:29.970 --> 24:31.054
Please.

24:31.054 --> 24:32.139
Okay.

24:35.184 --> 24:37.686
When we brought Gloria here, you said
you thought there were no listeners.

24:37.686 --> 24:39.855
- Uh-huh.
- There are no cameras.

24:39.855 --> 24:41.481
This maintenance guy,
he's here to put one in.

24:42.441 --> 24:44.776
Right now, this is a dead spot for them.

24:46.278 --> 24:48.197
- What's that?
- A hard drive.

24:48.197 --> 24:49.406
- What's on it?
- I don't know.

24:49.406 --> 24:52.159
I tried using your computer
to find out, but I couldn't open it.

24:52.159 --> 24:54.119
It requires some authorization.

24:54.620 --> 24:57.789
I'm gonna take it to Walk.
If anyone can get around it, she can.

24:58.624 --> 25:01.793
Could you just--
Could you let her know I'll be coming?

25:01.793 --> 25:04.254
I should be able to be there by 6:00.

25:04.254 --> 25:08.342
Yeah. Jules, you be safe. Please.

25:08.342 --> 25:09.635
Yeah, I will.

25:16.600 --> 25:17.434
Okay.

25:28.403 --> 25:33.408
ID. Next. ID.

25:33.408 --> 25:34.868
Come on.

25:34.868 --> 25:38.247
- ID. Bag check.
- Shit.

25:38.247 --> 25:40.832
- What's going on?
- I should be asking you.

25:42.292 --> 25:44.086
Can't you get them to speed this up?

25:44.086 --> 25:46.213
If I'm late for my next job,
I'm late for every one after.

25:46.213 --> 25:47.714
Yeah, sure, I'll look into it.

25:57.140 --> 25:58.308
Hey, Jerry.

26:04.940 --> 26:07.442
- Yes, sir?
- Could I trouble you for a cup of coffee?

26:22.374 --> 26:24.501
Black. No sugar, no cream.

26:27.421 --> 26:28.755
Right.

26:42.936 --> 26:43.937
Thanks.

26:45.147 --> 26:47.733
Also, could you do me a favor?

26:48.442 --> 26:50.319
Let me use your radio a second.

26:55.365 --> 26:57.743
- Mr. Sims, sir-- I just--
- Just one call.

26:57.743 --> 27:00.913
I just-- I really think we need to wait,

27:01.538 --> 27:03.498
you know, until someone gets back.

27:05.125 --> 27:06.293
If that's all right.

27:08.712 --> 27:12.049
Sheriff? Or Billings?

27:15.093 --> 27:17.888
Yeah, you're right. I understand.

27:18.555 --> 27:19.556
Don't worry about it.

27:20.224 --> 27:22.142
I won't hold it against you.

27:42.329 --> 27:43.330
Hey, you.

27:44.748 --> 27:47.709
- I missed her again, didn't I?
- I just put her down.

27:48.836 --> 27:49.837
Busy day?

27:50.671 --> 27:52.589
You have no idea.

27:56.301 --> 27:57.511
Dinner's almost ready.

28:10.190 --> 28:11.024
Are you okay?

28:16.697 --> 28:19.825
- Sorry, I just--
- Don't be. I'll get it later.

28:20.492 --> 28:22.119
The tremors have gotten worse
since you went upstairs.

28:22.119 --> 28:23.245
I'm fine.

28:24.204 --> 28:25.789
- This job is--
- It's not the job.

28:26.582 --> 28:27.708
I like the job. I just--

28:30.294 --> 28:34.006
She put me in a position today where I had
to choose between her and Sims.

28:34.006 --> 28:36.800
- How is that even a choice?
- It's complicated.

28:39.303 --> 28:41.430
People are saying she's laying
the groundwork for another rebellion.

28:41.430 --> 28:44.016
- Where'd you hear that?
- Everyone's on edge.

28:44.016 --> 28:46.768
Everything that's been happening,
all these deaths in a week.

28:46.768 --> 28:48.520
- It's not normal.
- If you're worried about me--

28:48.520 --> 28:51.857
I am.
Clearly, the stress is making it worse.

28:51.857 --> 28:55.944
Honey, I'll be fine. I promise you.

29:48.539 --> 29:49.748
Hello?

29:50.999 --> 29:54.294
Hello? Is anyone around?

30:05.180 --> 30:06.181
Hello?

30:16.984 --> 30:18.277
Son of a bitch.

30:22.197 --> 30:23.740
- Hello?
- Walk?

30:25.409 --> 30:26.535
What's going on?

30:26.535 --> 30:29.246
- Have you seen Jules?
- Should I have?

30:29.913 --> 30:31.665
She was supposed to be here an hour ago.

30:31.665 --> 30:34.418
- Can you let me know if you see her?
- Will do.

30:58.025 --> 30:59.026
Lukas Kyle?

30:59.693 --> 31:00.694
Yes.

31:01.195 --> 31:02.279
For you.

31:17.252 --> 31:18.253
You see it?

31:19.338 --> 31:20.881
I see a "W."

31:54.540 --> 31:55.541
Hi. Get in.

31:56.166 --> 31:57.793
- Were you followed?
- No.

31:58.794 --> 32:01.171
In about five minutes,
Judicial raiders are gonna be here.

32:01.171 --> 32:02.506
I've got three to talk.

32:04.341 --> 32:05.342
Why are you--

32:06.051 --> 32:07.511
They can hear us. Okay? Don't.

32:07.511 --> 32:09.304
Okay, I don't understand what you're--

32:09.304 --> 32:10.764
Look, I've got this.

32:11.849 --> 32:14.017
- An old hard drive?
- Yeah, and I need to get into it,

32:14.017 --> 32:16.895
but it requires some kind of authorization
I don't have.

32:19.189 --> 32:22.818
Okay, what kind of authorization?

32:23.402 --> 32:24.570
Sys-- something.

32:25.696 --> 32:27.906
- Sysop?
- Yeah. What's that?

32:28.699 --> 32:30.993
That's, like, reserved
for the head of IT, Judicial security.

32:30.993 --> 32:32.369
- That's not--
- And the sheriff?

32:33.078 --> 32:34.955
- Yes.
- I tried it. It didn't work.

32:34.955 --> 32:37.916
That's because you need to take it up
to your workplace computer.

32:38.500 --> 32:40.711
No, I can't go there.

32:41.503 --> 32:43.755
Is there any way
that you can work around it?

32:44.256 --> 32:45.465
Please.

32:45.465 --> 32:48.177
I think this drive holds
the answers to a lot of questions.

32:48.177 --> 32:49.595
What kind of questions?

32:50.137 --> 32:52.055
Like why Holston's wife went out to clean.

32:52.055 --> 32:54.641
What happened to George.
Why Jahns and Marnes were killed.

32:54.641 --> 32:57.853
- They were-- I'm sorry, they were what?
- Yeah, they were murdered.

33:00.189 --> 33:02.941
Why? And who's George?

33:04.902 --> 33:06.111
He was a friend.

33:07.029 --> 33:07.863
A friend?

33:11.742 --> 33:16.205
- Well, that explains a lot.
- No, I don't have time for this.

33:16.205 --> 33:17.873
- To use me? Clearly.
- Yeah. You know what?

33:17.873 --> 33:20.501
Right now I'm using you
'cause I have no other choice.

33:20.501 --> 33:22.669
And you should want to help me.

33:22.669 --> 33:24.838
You're the one sitting
in the cafeteria every single night,

33:24.838 --> 33:26.632
wondering what's out there.

33:26.632 --> 33:29.176
What if the answers
to your questions are on this drive?

33:29.843 --> 33:33.138
Well, I don't think
that I should be trying to open something

33:33.138 --> 33:35.557
- that I'm not authorized to open.
- No, but I am.

33:35.557 --> 33:38.143
Yes, Juliette,
but the rules apply to everyone.

33:43.899 --> 33:45.317
What the fuck?

33:50.697 --> 33:52.157
Look at this.

33:52.157 --> 33:53.700
A sensor. A camera.

33:53.700 --> 33:56.286
This is how they look at us.
This is how they control us.

33:59.915 --> 34:02.709
- These are in our homes?
- These are everywhere.

34:02.709 --> 34:05.504
And if we don't figure out the truth,
no one else will.

34:05.504 --> 34:09.174
So, please help me.

34:09.882 --> 34:11.092
- Please.
- I--

34:13.136 --> 34:16.431
Even if I could, my mom--

34:16.431 --> 34:17.724
- I'm the only one--
- Your mom?

34:17.724 --> 34:19.434
Yes, I'm the only one
taking care of her right now.

34:19.434 --> 34:21.228
- If something happens to me, I can't--
- It's--

34:22.020 --> 34:23.230
Time's up.

34:23.230 --> 34:25.148
You better leave too. For your mom's sake.

34:26.525 --> 34:27.400
Juliette.

34:30.070 --> 34:31.697
Fuck. Juliette.

34:45.918 --> 34:50.799
Juliette Nichols. By Judicial
order, open the door immediately.

35:01.852 --> 35:03.061
ID and bag, please.

35:03.061 --> 35:05.439
- Bag was checked upstairs. I'm in a hurry.
- ID and bag, please.

35:05.439 --> 35:07.399
Are you serious? Do you know who I am?

35:07.399 --> 35:08.775
- Ma'am.
- This is my ID.

35:08.775 --> 35:10.652
- Open your bag.
- Where is your supervisor?

35:10.652 --> 35:13.322
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Wherever they are, they won't be pleased.

35:13.906 --> 35:15.657
This is your sheriff, and she's with me.

35:16.283 --> 35:17.117
But--

35:17.659 --> 35:19.870
Now you're questioning the mayor too?

35:24.833 --> 35:26.835
You arrested Sims.
Now there's checkpoints.

35:26.835 --> 35:29.004
- What the fuck is going on, Sheriff?
- You were right. Okay?

35:29.004 --> 35:31.882
Judicial is planning a takeover,
but Meadows is not the one behind it.

35:32.633 --> 35:34.551
- It's Sims.
- Can't be.

35:35.886 --> 35:37.888
Robert is so by the book.

35:38.430 --> 35:39.806
We can't talk here.

35:39.806 --> 35:42.518
- I know a place. It's a bit of a walk.
- Okay.

35:50.025 --> 35:51.026
Okay.

35:52.027 --> 35:54.905
We're about as alone as we can get
in the Silo.

35:55.447 --> 35:56.823
Walk me through it.

35:56.823 --> 35:59.409
You think Sims
is secretly running Judicial?

35:59.409 --> 36:01.578
Yeah. It's not the judge.

36:02.371 --> 36:04.039
- Well, what does Sims want?
- I don't know.

36:04.623 --> 36:07.084
Control the Silo? Cover up a crime?

36:07.084 --> 36:09.086
I don't know.
Whatever it is, he wants me gone.

36:09.086 --> 36:10.462
And after you, me.

36:12.339 --> 36:14.258
I never wanted this fucking job.

36:16.260 --> 36:17.553
What are they looking for?

36:19.096 --> 36:20.222
What do you mean?

36:20.222 --> 36:23.725
Well, they searched your apartment.
Now there's checkpoints everywhere.

36:25.602 --> 36:27.354
What do you have that's so threatening?

36:29.731 --> 36:31.108
I don't know what you're talking about.

36:31.108 --> 36:34.695
The clock is running, Juliette.
There isn't much time left.

36:35.487 --> 36:36.738
If you have the hard drive, then--

36:39.783 --> 36:40.784
Fuck me.

36:41.827 --> 36:43.120
I said, "hard drive."

36:44.538 --> 36:46.373
How would I know that it's a hard drive?

36:47.541 --> 36:48.584
Oops.

36:52.963 --> 36:55.549
You. You're the one.

36:57.384 --> 37:01.805
I'm sorry, Sheriff Nichols.
Did you just say you want to go outside?

37:03.265 --> 37:05.392
No, I didn't.

37:05.392 --> 37:08.729
I distinctly heard you say you want
to go outside.

37:08.729 --> 37:11.356
- Robert, did you hear that?
- Sure did.

37:11.356 --> 37:12.733
No.

37:12.733 --> 37:14.818
That's two sheriffs in as many weeks.

37:15.319 --> 37:17.321
What is it about being sheriff these days?

37:17.321 --> 37:19.990
You're the one.
Meadows isn't afraid of him.

37:19.990 --> 37:22.534
She's afraid of you.

37:24.203 --> 37:25.329
Yeah.

37:27.080 --> 37:30.876
The Founders knew someone
would have to make the hard decisions

37:30.876 --> 37:32.377
to keep our Silo alive.

37:33.086 --> 37:38.008
A person that possessed the knowledge,
the intelligence,

37:38.008 --> 37:41.303
the information about everything
that happens here.

37:42.888 --> 37:43.889
Lucky me.

37:44.848 --> 37:49.853
Why would you kill all those people?
I don't understand.

37:49.853 --> 37:52.731
Miss Nichols,
throughout our entire existence,

37:52.731 --> 37:57.110
problems have arisen
that must be taken care of.

37:58.403 --> 38:03.283
The needs of the many
require the sacrifices of the few.

38:03.283 --> 38:04.368
For what?

38:05.536 --> 38:07.829
For a hard drive
and some fucking heat tape?

38:07.829 --> 38:08.914
This isn't about heat tape.

38:08.914 --> 38:10.332
This is about survival.

38:10.332 --> 38:13.919
And that hard drive threatens the lives
of everyone in this Silo.

38:13.919 --> 38:18.423
And you are the greatest threat
to our home in 140 years.

38:18.423 --> 38:20.717
Well, you were.

38:59.965 --> 39:01.466
Where are her friends?

39:01.967 --> 39:03.260
Her sister. Her aunt.

39:03.260 --> 39:05.262
- You know why they're not--
- They're cowards.

39:06.221 --> 39:07.222
That's not--

39:09.850 --> 39:12.477
If she'd died of a heart attack,
they'd all be here.

39:14.980 --> 39:17.024
I know it feels
like more should be done, but--

39:17.024 --> 39:18.108
But nothing.

39:20.152 --> 39:21.153
They're cowards.

39:22.362 --> 39:23.363
So was she.

39:26.033 --> 39:27.034
Jules.

39:40.797 --> 39:42.925
Go on. Leave!

39:43.675 --> 39:46.512
Leave! Leave, damn it! Leave!

40:02.736 --> 40:05.572
I told you you'd regret arresting me.

40:23.257 --> 40:25.092
You got this from Hank?

40:25.092 --> 40:27.886
All of the sheriff's stations
got a message ten minutes ago.

40:27.886 --> 40:31.139
No, it doesn't make any sense.
Look, she was on her way here.

40:31.849 --> 40:33.684
- Who were the witnesses?
- The mayor.

40:33.684 --> 40:35.519
Some Judicial raiders.

40:36.019 --> 40:38.272
Yeah, let's believe them.
They never lied to us before.

40:38.272 --> 40:40.482
I'm just telling you what I heard, Walk.

40:40.482 --> 40:43.610
All right. You're right.
I'm sorry, Shirley. I'm just--

40:43.610 --> 40:44.778
I know.

40:47.614 --> 40:50.450
Knox said they'd eventually punish us
for the rebellion.

40:51.618 --> 40:53.620
I always thought he was crazy.

40:55.455 --> 40:58.792
So? What happens next?

41:06.967 --> 41:09.553
Wait, Paul. Please, just listen to me.

41:09.553 --> 41:12.306
- No. I'm done trying to make sense of you.
- I never-- No, listen! You need--

41:12.306 --> 41:14.141
You want me to enforce the Pact
when it suits you...

41:14.141 --> 41:15.475
- No.
- ...and not to when it doesn't?

41:15.475 --> 41:17.477
- I never said that I wanted to go out.
- I can't do that.

41:17.477 --> 41:19.104
- I heard it.
- No.

41:19.104 --> 41:20.981
- As did the mayor and my agents.
- No.

41:20.981 --> 41:23.192
More than enough evidence,
I'd think, Sheriff Billings.

41:23.192 --> 41:25.527
- I'm not sheriff until we finish--
- No. They're trying to set me up.

41:25.527 --> 41:26.987
- Shut up!
- You're lying!

41:26.987 --> 41:29.823
Hey! If you believe you were misheard,
you have the right to request a hearing.

41:29.823 --> 41:30.908
- Do I? With who?
- Yes!

41:30.908 --> 41:33.035
With Judicial? He's fucking Judicial!

41:35.579 --> 41:36.830
I said shut up!

41:38.749 --> 41:40.250
That was uncalled for, Robert!

41:41.835 --> 41:44.713
I warned her.
Make sure you mention that in your report.

41:50.260 --> 41:51.887
What are you looking at?

41:59.311 --> 42:00.145
Hey.

42:03.857 --> 42:05.150
Oh, shit.

42:18.080 --> 42:19.581
Don't!
