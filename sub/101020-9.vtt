WEBVTT

00:17.642 --> 00:18.518
Are you sure?

00:20.020 --> 00:21.312
I have to do this.

00:21.396 --> 00:24.232
Breaking a pact with the most
powerful grimoire ever created is--

00:24.315 --> 00:25.525
It's kind of a big deal.

00:26.026 --> 00:28.486
I was going to say "potential suicide."

00:31.823 --> 00:33.658
I can't live my life without magic.

00:56.056 --> 01:00.143
<i>Bain na ceangail seo.</i>
<i>Cuir deireadh leis an ngeimheal seo.</i>

01:10.111 --> 01:11.071
All right, then.

01:29.839 --> 01:32.383
<i>Officials are still looking for answers</i>

01:32.467 --> 01:36.554
<i>after five terminally ill children claimed</i>
<i>an angel came to them in the night</i>

01:36.638 --> 01:41.226
<i>and cured them of illnesses as varied</i>
<i>as cancer, Krabbe disease, and--</i>

01:41.309 --> 01:42.769
Wow. You hear that?

01:44.229 --> 01:46.606
I'm glad I'm not on the <i>respondió</i> team.

01:46.689 --> 01:47.816
Hey, dude, trying to study.

01:47.899 --> 01:50.193
Yeah. Greek mythology.

01:51.111 --> 01:52.695
That'll come in handy in the real world.

01:57.700 --> 01:59.828
-See? There it goes again.

02:00.328 --> 02:02.455
And what are we gonna do about it?
Nothing.

02:02.539 --> 02:04.415
You know the rules.
We gotta wait for permission.

02:04.499 --> 02:06.584
That's all we've been doing
for the last three months.

02:06.668 --> 02:08.586
We hear the ringing,
we track down the magic,

02:08.670 --> 02:10.255
it turns out to be a bunch of Prax-holes,

02:10.338 --> 02:12.590
-and Vera makes us sit here and wait.

02:12.674 --> 02:16.511
And wait, and wait, and wait.

02:16.636 --> 02:17.679
And wait!

02:17.762 --> 02:19.472
That was the deal, okay?

02:19.556 --> 02:21.516
It's a bad deal, Jack, it's like...

02:21.850 --> 02:23.393
getting paid in Bitcoin.

02:24.519 --> 02:25.937
Never should have signed it.

02:26.938 --> 02:29.232
If Lilith was here, we never would have.

02:29.315 --> 02:31.568
Joining the Order was the only way
to preserve the Knights.

02:31.651 --> 02:33.862
But we didn't preserve the Knights,
did we? Or, uh...

02:34.612 --> 02:35.530
can't you count?

02:36.614 --> 02:38.950
-We serve at the Grand Magus's pleasure.

02:39.033 --> 02:40.702
See, that's another thing.

02:40.785 --> 02:43.163
I do not have time for
your Hamish and Vera shipping theories.

02:43.246 --> 02:44.455
I'm calling them "Ver-mish."

02:44.539 --> 02:45.748
I cannot fail this exam.

02:50.378 --> 02:52.130
Still think we should ask for permission?

02:58.636 --> 02:59.888
Where is everyone?

03:07.979 --> 03:09.856
Looks like they were trying
to lure a leprechaun.

03:10.481 --> 03:12.150
Wait, leprechauns are real?

03:12.233 --> 03:13.067
Oh, yeah.

03:13.151 --> 03:16.321
Except they're covered in fur
and they've got claws and sharp teeth.

03:16.404 --> 03:17.238
Huh.

03:18.823 --> 03:21.159
Check it out. Someone's clothes.

03:22.243 --> 03:23.661
So they were here.

03:23.745 --> 03:26.247
Then there was a loud noise
and a big, red light, and now...

03:26.331 --> 03:27.790
Puppy!

03:28.750 --> 03:31.252
Oh, hello. Hello.

03:31.753 --> 03:33.338
Do you know what happened here?

03:33.713 --> 03:34.881
I bet you do.

03:34.964 --> 03:36.633
-I bet you do.

03:37.175 --> 03:39.510
Uh...
Randall, these puppies are brand new.

03:39.594 --> 03:40.428
I know.

03:40.511 --> 03:42.931
-They've still got that new puppy smell.
-No, dude,

03:43.014 --> 03:45.850
I think these are the Praxis members
we followed here.

03:46.809 --> 03:47.644
Ugh!

03:51.439 --> 03:52.482
All right, split up.

03:53.107 --> 03:53.942
Okay.

03:57.987 --> 03:58.988
Randall, leave the puppy.

03:59.072 --> 04:00.949
But I already named her.

04:04.953 --> 04:06.371
Wait here, Bandit.

04:22.720 --> 04:23.554
Hey.

04:26.808 --> 04:27.725
<i>Basc chun báis!</i>

04:35.400 --> 04:37.235
Jack, you need to see this.

04:37.735 --> 04:39.070
Hey, I just saw...

04:41.531 --> 04:42.490
Holy shit.

04:42.573 --> 04:44.450
Yeah. That's what I said.

04:47.412 --> 04:48.913
No hide lockers, though.

04:54.961 --> 04:58.256
What kind of monster
puts black olives on a Hawaiian pizza?

04:59.215 --> 05:00.258
Alyssa Drake.

05:02.135 --> 05:03.094
<i>She was there?</i>

05:03.678 --> 05:05.722
-Why?
-Based on the books and the pizza,

05:05.805 --> 05:07.557
I would say she was
in full-on research mode.

05:07.640 --> 05:09.350
Researching what, exactly?

05:09.434 --> 05:12.353
I would've asked her, but she was busy
trying to blast me through a wall.

05:13.313 --> 05:14.981
I thought her magic was defective.

05:15.064 --> 05:16.232
Felt pretty fixed to me.

05:19.944 --> 05:21.446
Remember your place, disciple.

05:22.322 --> 05:24.866
Tell me about these puppies.

05:25.283 --> 05:28.119
The girl one is Bandit,

05:28.202 --> 05:30.913
and the other girl one is Larry. See?

05:31.539 --> 05:32.707
I'm a Bandit guy, but--

05:32.790 --> 05:34.375
Who cares about puppies?

05:35.626 --> 05:39.464
Your wolves just let a traitor
slip through their hands.

05:39.547 --> 05:41.924
We also recovered
a third of your stolen inventory.

05:42.008 --> 05:44.135
Yeah, "we" sure did.

05:44.510 --> 05:46.512
Inventory that we wouldn't have to recover

05:46.596 --> 05:48.681
if you hadn't stolen it
in the first place.

05:48.765 --> 05:52.060
Blame us all you want,
Praxis always had the Order in its sights.

05:52.310 --> 05:53.436
It was just a matter of time.

05:53.519 --> 05:56.189
Your actions made it a damn sight easier
for them to hurt us.

05:56.272 --> 06:00.193
Councilor Kepler, as always,
your opinion is welcome.

06:00.902 --> 06:02.779
However, this raid was a success.

06:03.446 --> 06:05.281
I think the Knights should be rewarded.

06:06.657 --> 06:09.118
I'm promoting you all
to the rank of Magistratus.

06:10.119 --> 06:12.747
-Five points to Gryffindor.

06:12.830 --> 06:13.706
Vera, please.

06:13.790 --> 06:14.999
We should have a party.

06:15.500 --> 06:17.210
I think we could all use one.

06:17.960 --> 06:20.546
Elizabeth, if you will see
to the arrangements.

06:20.630 --> 06:22.173
I'll order some wine.

06:22.256 --> 06:24.008
Champagne, please.

06:24.509 --> 06:27.095
We're at war with Praxis, not good taste.

06:27.887 --> 06:28.763
That will be all.

06:34.018 --> 06:37.188
Randall, buddy,
I think we need to have a little talk.

06:37.271 --> 06:38.523
What's to talk about?

06:39.023 --> 06:41.109
Something on your mind, Mr. Morton?

06:41.734 --> 06:43.277
Well, I was just wondering...

06:46.906 --> 06:49.659
If I saw Alyssa again,
maybe I could convince her to come back.

06:53.329 --> 06:55.039
Miss Drake made her choice.

06:57.708 --> 07:00.586
You said there was a flash of light.

07:01.712 --> 07:02.630
Was it red?

07:02.713 --> 07:04.590
You know what it was, don't you?

07:04.674 --> 07:05.675
I have a theory.

07:07.051 --> 07:10.388
If I am correct, dark days are ahead.

07:10.471 --> 07:12.056
I suggest you prepare yourself.

07:12.140 --> 07:13.891
Cryptic, great. Prepare for what?

07:13.975 --> 07:14.934
The worst.

07:16.644 --> 07:18.771
Always prepare for the worst, Mr. Morton.

07:19.522 --> 07:20.690
Enjoy your party.

07:29.157 --> 07:29.991
Champagne?

07:31.826 --> 07:34.871
So they steal everything from the vault,
lie about it,

07:34.954 --> 07:37.165
nearly get us all killed, twice,

07:37.915 --> 07:39.542
and they get promoted?

07:43.296 --> 07:45.047
That's such bullshit.

07:45.131 --> 07:48.134
A real Grand Magus
would have killed them by now.

07:49.844 --> 07:51.095
Mmm.

07:51.179 --> 07:53.806
Good evening, medicums.

07:55.349 --> 07:58.019
Beautiful ceremony, wasn't it?

07:58.352 --> 07:59.770
Magistratus.

08:00.521 --> 08:02.440
If you say so.

08:03.774 --> 08:05.735
Randall. We need to talk.

08:05.818 --> 08:06.944
Ooh, I'm sorry, Nicole.

08:07.028 --> 08:08.362
I'm not really in the mood for

08:08.446 --> 08:10.948
"It's your fault Lilith is in Hell"
theater.

08:11.032 --> 08:12.033
Well, it is your fault.

08:12.116 --> 08:13.618
Great. Enjoy the party.

08:14.285 --> 08:16.579
Your last raid... There's a book.

08:18.289 --> 08:19.916
I think it's <i>the</i> book.

08:20.333 --> 08:21.918
The one to help retrieve Lilith.

08:22.001 --> 08:25.338
Oh. Okay. Let me just sober up.

08:27.423 --> 08:28.758
I need crackers.

08:29.509 --> 08:31.636
And olives and almonds.

08:33.429 --> 08:35.306
Tomorrow is fine.

08:35.389 --> 08:36.766
Meet me here at 11:00.

08:37.099 --> 08:38.684
Here, 11:00.

08:42.146 --> 08:44.815
There she is.

08:48.319 --> 08:50.029
Yeah.

08:50.530 --> 08:51.364
Hi.

08:53.241 --> 08:54.367
Are we fighting again?

08:54.909 --> 08:57.703
Okay, I really need you
to keep me in the loop on this.

08:57.787 --> 08:58.871
You've got to be kidding me.

08:58.955 --> 09:02.041
What? Vera's had us out hunting down
those Prax-holes.

09:03.626 --> 09:06.087
That's what I'm calling Praxis assholes.

09:06.170 --> 09:08.297
I was there when you thought of that,
remember?

09:10.841 --> 09:12.134
Yeah, I remember.

09:14.345 --> 09:18.849
Well, maybe not
that specific event, but...

09:19.350 --> 09:21.852
Sometimes your charm isn't that charming.

09:22.019 --> 09:23.354
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

09:24.230 --> 09:25.273
How about...

09:25.940 --> 09:27.149
right now?

09:30.444 --> 09:31.404
Mm-mm.

09:38.244 --> 09:40.454
What's the deal with this place, man?

09:40.538 --> 09:42.123
Everyone is so serious.

09:42.206 --> 09:45.209
Yeah, that's a $300 bottle
you're going to yak up later.

09:45.293 --> 09:46.127
Really?

09:46.877 --> 09:48.254
In that case...

09:49.755 --> 09:51.048
No, thanks, I'm good.

09:51.132 --> 09:52.550
What are you, pregnant?

09:53.009 --> 09:56.971
Come on, if we hurry we can get back
to the den before my brain goes numb.

09:57.054 --> 09:58.973
No, we can't leave. This is our party.

09:59.056 --> 10:01.517
Guys, we're
the Knights of Saint Christopher.

10:01.601 --> 10:05.479
We're beer pong and bouncy castles,
not...

10:05.563 --> 10:07.106
...whatever this is.

10:07.189 --> 10:08.941
It's a celery stick.
You know what celery is.

10:09.025 --> 10:10.359
Don't tell me what I know.

10:10.818 --> 10:12.820
You're not our leader anymore, Hamish.

10:13.487 --> 10:14.739
Leaders show up.

10:14.822 --> 10:16.365
I was helping the Grand Magus.

10:16.949 --> 10:19.452
-Yeah. He was "helping."

10:19.535 --> 10:21.287
In case you haven't realized,
we're at war.

10:21.370 --> 10:23.247
I know we are, but what are you?

10:25.291 --> 10:26.250
Let's go.

10:29.128 --> 10:30.504
Fucking dicks.

10:37.511 --> 10:38.804
Morale problems?

10:41.015 --> 10:43.851
I never thought I'd have to choose
between my friends and my integrity.

10:44.935 --> 10:47.146
Maybe they're right.
Maybe I should go on the next raid.

10:47.229 --> 10:48.814
I can't spare you right now.

10:49.815 --> 10:52.693
I need you on a research project.
Have you...

10:54.028 --> 10:56.030
ever heard of a Tartarus eruption?

10:57.114 --> 10:59.241
I always thought they were a myth.

11:02.828 --> 11:06.332
Some story my father told me
to scare me off magic.

11:11.545 --> 11:13.798
-<i>Qui fractus, sanetur.</i>

11:16.425 --> 11:18.552
And then I saw one, and it was...

11:18.636 --> 11:20.054
It's incredible.

11:21.972 --> 11:23.432
-Thank you.
-Exactly.

11:24.850 --> 11:25.768
Thank you.

11:35.236 --> 11:36.696
Salvador, this is serious.

11:36.779 --> 11:39.073
-We need to stop these eruptions.

11:39.156 --> 11:41.117
We need to find
the <i>Fors Factoram</i> incantation,

11:41.200 --> 11:43.369
and then these eruptions
will stop on their own.

11:43.452 --> 11:45.871
That's assuming
the <i>Fors Factoram</i> even exists.

11:45.955 --> 11:46.789
It does.

11:47.373 --> 11:49.166
I've gone through every book we liberated.

11:49.250 --> 11:52.670
If there was an incantation that let
everyone do magic without sacrificing,

11:52.753 --> 11:55.256
I would have at least found
a reference to it by now.

11:55.339 --> 11:57.883
-You need to have faith.

12:05.307 --> 12:06.809
Okay. Well, at least

12:07.435 --> 12:09.520
put a stop to the magic until we find it.

12:10.020 --> 12:11.731
Look around you, Alyssa.

12:12.314 --> 12:13.649
We're helping people.

12:13.733 --> 12:16.986
We're saving lives.
We're making the world better with magic.

12:17.445 --> 12:20.906
If a few Tartarus eruptions are the cost
of doing business in the short-term,

12:21.323 --> 12:22.158
so be it.

12:23.409 --> 12:26.620
If we don't put a stop to these eruptions,
people will get hurt.

12:27.329 --> 12:28.289
People like who?

12:28.664 --> 12:29.707
Jack Morton?

12:31.208 --> 12:33.294
I can't help that I still care about him.

12:34.837 --> 12:39.216
There's this quote I remember
from a story my father used to read me.

12:40.134 --> 12:43.554
"The only choice between love and war
is which will kill you first."

12:45.055 --> 12:47.224
That's depressing.

12:47.308 --> 12:48.267
So was my father.

12:52.104 --> 12:55.274
Hold on, hold on,
you found <i>The Sworn Book</i> of who?

12:55.357 --> 12:56.692
<i>The Sworn Book of Honorius.</i>

12:57.234 --> 12:59.653
It's the greatest hits of demon magic.

13:04.742 --> 13:06.118
And right here...

13:07.953 --> 13:09.830
is how to retrieve someone
from the demon realm.

13:11.916 --> 13:13.042
Why can't I read this?

13:13.125 --> 13:14.376
I thought I could read Latin.

13:15.377 --> 13:17.129
It's the medieval Latin dialect.

13:17.213 --> 13:19.715
-Hm.
-We need four powerful practitioners,

13:19.799 --> 13:22.176
an owl to sacrifice,
and a tether to Lilith.

13:22.259 --> 13:25.054
Right. Right, a tether.

13:25.137 --> 13:27.056
A tether.

13:27.139 --> 13:28.265
Tetherino.

13:28.349 --> 13:30.476
-A tether can be anything.
-Anything.

13:30.559 --> 13:32.186
-A person, an object.
-Person, object.

13:32.269 --> 13:34.271
It's something that ties a soul
to the earthly plane.

13:34.939 --> 13:35.856
Her hide.

13:36.774 --> 13:38.734
Timber is tethered to the hide locker.

13:38.818 --> 13:42.196
That's perfect. It creates a passage
into the demon realm directly to the soul.

13:42.279 --> 13:47.868
Great. So all we have to do is get
Timber's hide locker back from Praxis.

13:49.578 --> 13:50.538
Right.

13:52.540 --> 13:54.917
So this spell is as useless as the others.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.377
Slow down, Eeyore.

13:57.336 --> 13:59.171
We may actually have an in.

14:01.799 --> 14:02.800
Let me get this straight.

14:02.883 --> 14:05.177
You want me to track down my ex,
a magical fugitive,

14:05.261 --> 14:07.596
and ask her to give us back
a werewolf's hide locker?

14:07.680 --> 14:09.598
So we can save Lilith, yes.

14:09.682 --> 14:11.684
-Did you talk to Hamish?
-Yes...?

14:11.767 --> 14:13.018
We need to talk to Hamish.

14:13.102 --> 14:15.563
Okay, look, I think it's better
if we keep Hamish out of this,

14:15.646 --> 14:17.898
only until we know
if it's going to work or not.

14:17.982 --> 14:19.483
This is Lilith we're talking about.

14:19.567 --> 14:22.403
Exactly, which makes this
"Knight business."

14:22.945 --> 14:24.655
And Hamish is all about the Order
right now.

14:24.738 --> 14:26.198
We need to keep this on the down-low.

14:26.282 --> 14:28.868
Have you ever thought about
plotting secretly in private?

14:28.951 --> 14:31.036
-How do you do that?
-You're like a little sister.

14:31.745 --> 14:34.164
I can tell that you're up to something,
so spill it.

14:34.248 --> 14:36.041
It's a werewolf thing.
You wouldn't understand.

14:36.125 --> 14:38.460
So just because I don't have
some gross dog living inside me,

14:38.544 --> 14:40.754
I can't be in your boys' club?
That's sexist.

14:40.838 --> 14:41.672
You're sexist.

14:41.755 --> 14:43.382
I think you mean "sexiest."

14:43.465 --> 14:45.009
We're a gender-neutral collective.

14:45.092 --> 14:47.595
Yeah, and it's not like that. It's just...

14:48.429 --> 14:50.180
-It's about Lilith.
-Oh.

14:50.264 --> 14:51.307
I get it.

14:51.891 --> 14:55.060
Believe me, Randall, you've made it
very clear what actually matters to you.

14:57.646 --> 15:01.066
Okay, I'm going to take it
that you two are off right now.

15:01.150 --> 15:04.361
Honestly, I don't know.
It's hard being enemies with benefits.

15:04.445 --> 15:05.487
Go talk to her.

15:05.571 --> 15:06.405
Yeah.

15:06.488 --> 15:08.324
Actually, no. She kind of scares me.

15:08.407 --> 15:12.119
Also, you need to talk to Alyssa
and get that hide locker back.

15:12.202 --> 15:14.330
How? I don't even know where she is.

15:14.413 --> 15:16.582
Yeah, but you do know
where to look for her.

15:21.921 --> 15:24.298
Can I get a ham and pineapple
with black olives?

15:24.548 --> 15:25.591
Yeah, sure thing.

15:28.302 --> 15:29.678
I have a confession to make.

15:30.554 --> 15:33.265
I'm in a magic secret society
that controls the world.

15:33.807 --> 15:34.892
Also, I'm a werewolf.

15:35.225 --> 15:38.479
Plus, I cheated on my Ethics exam,
and then my professor exploded.

15:43.442 --> 15:44.610
Did Vera send you to kill me?

15:44.693 --> 15:47.655
No, I came alone.
I need to ask you a question.

15:48.822 --> 15:50.157
Please, it's important.

15:51.951 --> 15:53.869
Grab us a table. I'll be right there.

15:54.828 --> 15:56.246
And you better not try to kill me.

15:57.915 --> 15:59.083
That's $7.95.

16:05.839 --> 16:06.924
How'd you find me?

16:07.508 --> 16:09.134
Hawaiian and black olives.

16:09.802 --> 16:10.719
It wasn't hard.

16:13.889 --> 16:15.224
That's a cool disguise.

16:16.141 --> 16:19.353
Yeah, it's great that I can't even
get a pizza without hiding my face.

16:21.480 --> 16:22.773
What did you want to ask me?

16:27.528 --> 16:29.571
Do you ever wish it could be
like it was before?

16:32.032 --> 16:33.951
Oh, my God, you're here for closure.

16:34.034 --> 16:35.327
No, no. It's just...

16:36.370 --> 16:41.000
I'm reading this Greek myth
about a king named Lycaon,

16:41.083 --> 16:43.502
and he pisses off the gods,
so they turn him into a werewolf,

16:43.585 --> 16:45.379
and it's pretty cool at first, but...

16:46.797 --> 16:48.716
eventually Lycaon realizes that

16:48.799 --> 16:51.176
he'll never get to see
his friends and family again.

16:52.761 --> 16:54.179
Okay, and?

16:55.139 --> 16:59.727
It just means sometimes when
you make a choice, you can't undo it.

17:00.394 --> 17:02.521
I don't want to undo it.

17:02.980 --> 17:05.816
Praxis does everything
the Order claimed to stand for.

17:06.692 --> 17:08.610
We actually help people, Jack.

17:08.694 --> 17:11.280
When was the last time the Order
did something truly selfless?

17:11.363 --> 17:14.867
Yeah, well, it's not what Praxis does
that scares me.

17:14.950 --> 17:16.910
It's how they do it. It's dangerous.

17:16.994 --> 17:19.371
Yeah, well, the truth
can be dangerous sometimes.

17:19.455 --> 17:20.998
Yeah. Did you tell that to your friends

17:21.081 --> 17:23.375
before or after they were
permanently turned into puppies?

17:26.086 --> 17:27.838
-They knew the risk.
-They knew the risk?

17:29.256 --> 17:30.716
Come on, Alyssa, that's not you.

17:32.676 --> 17:34.970
You know, my whole life,
people have told me what I'm not.

17:36.013 --> 17:38.057
Not strong enough, not brave, not smart.

17:38.140 --> 17:41.226
"Just be pretty, just be quiet,
just do what you're told."

17:41.310 --> 17:42.394
Well, I'm sick of it.

17:42.895 --> 17:46.565
I'm done being guided by well-meaning
people who only see my limitations.

17:48.734 --> 17:49.860
I just want you back.

17:56.158 --> 17:57.618
I was never yours.

18:01.205 --> 18:02.331
What are you gonna do?

18:03.040 --> 18:05.042
Fight me? Hurt me?

18:08.045 --> 18:09.379
Eat my heart out?

18:12.007 --> 18:14.802
<i>♪ When your feelings</i>
<i>Don't feel like your own ♪</i>

18:15.886 --> 18:18.388
<i>♪ Holding onto something</i>
<i>That fell through ♪</i>

18:19.056 --> 18:21.934
<i>♪ Oh baby, I can feel the chemicals ♪</i>

18:22.851 --> 18:25.145
<i>♪ But I can never be alone with you ♪</i>

18:25.229 --> 18:26.313
This is a terrible idea.

18:26.396 --> 18:27.314
I totally agree.

18:27.397 --> 18:29.858
<i>♪ Don't feel like your own ♪</i>

18:31.944 --> 18:34.780
No, why can I walk away
from everything except you?

18:34.863 --> 18:37.491
Even with my memory erased,
I still remembered you.

18:37.866 --> 18:38.992
I always will.

18:39.076 --> 18:40.786
<i>♪ Can never be alone with you ♪</i>

18:40.869 --> 18:42.746
<i>♪ You you you ♪</i>

18:42.830 --> 18:44.957
Wait, wait.<i> </i>What did you want to ask me?

18:45.040 --> 18:47.209
At the pizza place,
you said you had something to ask me.

18:47.292 --> 18:50.462
Okay, but bear in mind, I meant
to ask you this before we ended up here.

18:50.546 --> 18:51.922
Yeah, get to the point.

18:54.716 --> 18:57.427
Nicole found a spell that can bring Lilith
back from the demon realm.

18:58.595 --> 19:00.681
But we need Timber's locker.

19:04.434 --> 19:06.145
Those lockers are powerful magic.

19:06.562 --> 19:08.063
I'm asking you to help Lilith.

19:10.274 --> 19:12.234
Salvador will want something in return.

19:13.819 --> 19:14.778
You want to trade.

19:15.654 --> 19:16.864
Fine. Um...

19:17.531 --> 19:20.826
I... I will warn you
before the next raid happens.

19:21.827 --> 19:22.661
Deal?

19:24.413 --> 19:26.456
You'd betray the Order for this?

19:26.540 --> 19:28.333
I would do anything for my friends.

19:29.042 --> 19:29.877
Deal?

19:32.671 --> 19:33.505
Deal.

19:35.257 --> 19:36.758
Now shut up and kiss me.

19:38.886 --> 19:41.722
Vera. Wait, this is...
This isn't why I'm here.

19:42.681 --> 19:45.475
Your text specifically said
you had something big to show me.

19:45.809 --> 19:48.103
I can see how that might be misconstrued.

19:50.939 --> 19:52.733
Make it fast. I'm busy.

19:56.153 --> 19:57.154
You were right.

19:57.613 --> 20:00.908
The Praxis puppies, they were the result
of a Tartarus eruption.

20:00.991 --> 20:02.367
-You're sure?
-Positive.

20:04.119 --> 20:06.622
There are several accounts
which corroborate

20:06.705 --> 20:08.040
what Jack and Randall witnessed.

20:08.123 --> 20:11.126
A loud horn, a flash of red light,
and after that,

20:11.835 --> 20:12.920
pure chaos.

20:13.295 --> 20:14.129
Okay, I'm listening.

20:15.464 --> 20:17.633
Technically, eruptions are happening
all the time,

20:17.716 --> 20:19.593
but they're small, almost microscopic.

20:19.676 --> 20:22.179
You do a spell wrong, I stub my toe.
No big deal.

20:22.262 --> 20:23.680
<i>I</i> do a spell wrong?

20:23.764 --> 20:25.515
Hypothetically speaking, of course.

20:25.599 --> 20:26.892
Of course.

20:27.434 --> 20:30.354
So why aren't these eruptions
staying microscopic?

20:30.437 --> 20:32.981
'Cause Praxis is giving magic
to hundreds of tourists

20:33.065 --> 20:35.651
who are performing
hundreds of incantations improperly.

20:35.734 --> 20:39.696
Praxis is destabilizing
the magic energy field.

20:40.364 --> 20:43.116
The eruptions will likely
keep increasing in size.

20:43.200 --> 20:48.372
Combining and growing bigger
until they become an apocalypse eruption.

20:51.875 --> 20:53.001
The plagues of Egypt.

20:55.212 --> 20:56.088
Pompeii.

20:59.841 --> 21:00.842
Tunguska.

21:03.095 --> 21:03.929
Okay.

21:04.846 --> 21:09.643
Each one of these cataclysmic events was
actually caused by an apocalypse eruption.

21:13.355 --> 21:15.607
Well, Alyssa agreed to give us
Timber's hide locker.

21:15.691 --> 21:17.150
-That's great.
-But,

21:17.234 --> 21:20.112
first we have to tip her off
to the next raid on Praxis.

21:20.195 --> 21:21.530
We have to betray the Order.

21:22.030 --> 21:23.115
Okay.

21:23.198 --> 21:24.032
Fine.

21:24.700 --> 21:25.993
You know what you're agreeing to?

21:26.576 --> 21:27.411
I do.

21:27.494 --> 21:30.998
Look, it's not just the Order
we have to betray, it's a fellow Knight.

21:31.081 --> 21:32.582
I mean, Hamish has all the intel.

21:32.666 --> 21:33.625
What if he says no?

21:33.709 --> 21:35.043
I know a way to make him talk.

21:35.127 --> 21:37.546
Me, too, but I feel squeamish
about torture.

21:38.213 --> 21:39.965
I was talking about a truth potion.

21:40.048 --> 21:42.134
Yeah. Me, too.

21:44.094 --> 21:45.304
Oh, you were being serious?

21:46.513 --> 21:47.723
Let's do that.

21:50.642 --> 21:51.768
What is that?

21:52.436 --> 21:54.396
You've never used a Cretian loom before?

21:55.022 --> 21:56.023
Have you?

21:56.106 --> 21:56.940
No.

21:57.858 --> 21:59.026
But I've read about it.

21:59.109 --> 22:01.695
The loom is basically
the original portal gun.

22:01.778 --> 22:02.696
Daedalus built it,

22:03.280 --> 22:05.824
and he hid it at the center
of the labyrinth

22:05.907 --> 22:08.118
in case he got lost in his own creations.

22:08.201 --> 22:10.620
So this thing'll take us anywhere?

22:10.704 --> 22:12.414
Like straight into Praxis headquarters.

22:12.497 --> 22:15.083
-You need to know where you're going.
-Then what's the point?

22:15.167 --> 22:17.044
The point, Tyler,

22:18.045 --> 22:22.674
is that Randall and those other mutts
are at the Blade & Chalice right now

22:22.758 --> 22:24.051
and they're sitting ducks.

22:24.134 --> 22:24.968
Okay.

22:26.011 --> 22:28.013
So what spell do you want
to hit them with?

22:32.601 --> 22:34.019
Hame-burger Helper.

22:38.607 --> 22:39.941
What seems to be the problem?

22:40.442 --> 22:41.318
What?

22:42.736 --> 22:43.904
Nothing.

22:43.987 --> 22:44.946
Problem? What--

22:45.030 --> 22:48.075
We saw you in here and just thought
we might have a drink... together.

22:48.992 --> 22:51.078
I haven't had a drink
for three months now.

22:51.161 --> 22:52.788
After Salvador attacked me,

22:52.871 --> 22:55.374
I had a "Come to Jack Daniels" moment.

22:55.832 --> 22:56.666
Wow.

22:58.543 --> 23:00.545
That is quite the change...

23:01.755 --> 23:02.589
worth...

23:03.799 --> 23:04.758
celebrating.

23:11.348 --> 23:13.100
-What's in it?
-Love...

23:14.267 --> 23:17.062
and... a little...

23:18.355 --> 23:19.189
truth potion.

23:24.319 --> 23:25.153
I see.

23:26.780 --> 23:31.201
And what truth do you need
from me, exactly?

23:32.911 --> 23:34.746
When the next raid on Praxis is.

23:35.956 --> 23:38.542
-You better have a damn good reason for--
-It's for Lilith.

23:47.426 --> 23:49.428
<i>Porta rescindatur ut vis fluat.</i>

23:54.433 --> 23:57.352
<i>Transitum ad laminam calicemque</i>
<i>nobis permittatur.</i>

24:05.026 --> 24:06.403
<i>So this is where we're at?</i>

24:06.903 --> 24:09.114
You need to lie to me and drug me
to get information?

24:09.197 --> 24:10.615
We don't know what side you're on.

24:11.616 --> 24:13.368
You think I would turn my back on Lilith?

24:13.452 --> 24:16.079
I don't know what you'll do
now that you're Vera's little lap dog.

24:16.163 --> 24:19.541
Are you intentionally ignoring the fact
that our interests align with the Order's?

24:19.624 --> 24:22.377
Can you tell us when the next raid
on Praxis is or not?

24:23.378 --> 24:24.212
Why should I?

24:24.296 --> 24:25.589
Because we're Knights.

24:25.672 --> 24:29.759
Because we gave our lives to the cause,
and right now that cause is saving Lilith.

24:29.843 --> 24:33.054
What about fighting the anarchists that
got her trapped there in the first place?

24:33.138 --> 24:34.723
We got her trapped, okay?

24:35.265 --> 24:36.266
We did.

24:36.349 --> 24:39.102
We robbed the Order,
and Lilith paid the price.

24:39.519 --> 24:42.314
And yeah, Praxis made it worse,
but this is on all of us.

24:43.940 --> 24:45.734
And we can't fix it without your help.

24:48.445 --> 24:49.362
Still.

24:50.614 --> 24:51.573
You could've asked.

24:53.992 --> 24:55.702
Yeah. We should have.

24:59.998 --> 25:01.082
So...

25:03.210 --> 25:04.503
What do we do now?

25:06.505 --> 25:07.797
You could put some in my coffee.

25:12.010 --> 25:13.803
Plausible deniability could be useful.

25:19.893 --> 25:20.727
Look that way.

25:21.478 --> 25:22.312
Just...

25:26.816 --> 25:27.692
Okay.

25:30.946 --> 25:33.240
Next time you question my loyalty...

25:34.199 --> 25:35.867
remember who taught you how to be Knights.

25:35.951 --> 25:37.994
<i>I knew you idiots</i>
<i>were up to something.</i>

25:38.078 --> 25:39.246
No, we're not.

25:39.329 --> 25:40.747
<i>-Not you.</i>

25:40.830 --> 25:42.082
<i>These idiots.</i>

25:46.253 --> 25:47.295
That can't be good.

25:49.589 --> 25:50.799
You better start explaining.

25:50.882 --> 25:53.510
I don't have to explain myself
to a wolf-loving acolyte.

25:53.593 --> 25:56.596
You may outrank me,
but you're way beneath me.

25:56.680 --> 25:59.140
- Um, Angus?

25:59.224 --> 26:01.476
Is the loom supposed to be doing that?

26:02.978 --> 26:03.937
What the hell?

26:06.231 --> 26:07.691
Is that another portal?

26:19.619 --> 26:20.954
Get away from that thing!

26:30.964 --> 26:32.048
<i>An eruption?</i>

26:32.924 --> 26:33.758
In the temple?

26:33.842 --> 26:36.511
I always assumed
Tartarus eruptions were a myth.

26:36.970 --> 26:40.515
They are very real,
and they are getting bigger.

26:40.599 --> 26:44.603
But if they only affect inexperienced
or incompetent practitioners,

26:44.686 --> 26:48.773
then we should let the eruptions
do our work for us, and...

26:49.316 --> 26:52.110
Praxis wipes itself out
and we don't have to lift a finger.

26:53.320 --> 26:57.824
Every time one occurs,
magic itself gets more unstable,

26:58.241 --> 27:00.368
and in turn, the eruptions get bigger.

27:00.452 --> 27:02.621
So if Praxis continues unchecked,

27:02.704 --> 27:04.748
they will eventually perform
enough bad magic

27:04.831 --> 27:06.708
to cause an apocalypse eruption.

27:07.292 --> 27:09.002
And that is...

27:11.421 --> 27:14.758
An eruption that's big enough
to cause the apocalypse.

27:16.843 --> 27:20.847
I can't stop Praxis
if I have to confer with Council

27:20.930 --> 27:23.141
every time I need to make a move.

27:28.021 --> 27:30.315
I'm requesting you grant me Imperium.

27:32.233 --> 27:33.318
-Wha...

27:34.653 --> 27:40.325
N-No Council has granted a Grand Magus
Imperium for over 150 years.

27:41.242 --> 27:42.952
Not even Edward Coventry.

27:43.620 --> 27:46.748
All I'm asking for
is the temporary authority

27:46.831 --> 27:49.876
to save the Order and everyone else
from extinction.

27:49.959 --> 27:52.879
Based on some very questionable evidence.

27:54.756 --> 27:58.968
But you have asked, so we shall vote.

28:00.804 --> 28:03.056
Council, all in favor?

28:09.396 --> 28:10.689
It's unanimous.

28:11.314 --> 28:14.359
I'm sorry, Grand Magus,
you'll just have to soldier on.

28:15.819 --> 28:19.322
As do I. I have a corrupt politician
in my courtroom

28:19.406 --> 28:21.741
who is about to owe me a huge favor.

28:21.825 --> 28:25.870
Mm. The wheels of justice,
they do love their grease.

28:26.371 --> 28:28.081
However, if you're free tomorrow...

28:29.416 --> 28:31.042
you should join us on a raid.

28:31.418 --> 28:34.379
Then you can see firsthand
what we're up against.

28:35.004 --> 28:36.423
-Hm, sounds--
- Exciting.

28:38.633 --> 28:40.385
Yes! Well...

28:41.428 --> 28:44.222
wouldn't be a magic war
if it wasn't exciting.

28:44.889 --> 28:45.932
Excuse me.

28:53.690 --> 28:55.525
Does the raid have to be tomorrow?

28:57.402 --> 28:58.903
I asked Hamish the same thing.

29:00.655 --> 29:02.657
Jack, I don't know what to say.

29:03.867 --> 29:04.701
Thank you.

29:07.328 --> 29:08.163
Yeah.

29:15.253 --> 29:16.546
So what happens now?

29:17.297 --> 29:18.757
I'll tell Salvador,

29:18.840 --> 29:22.635
and we'll clear out,
and then you get the hide locker.

29:22.844 --> 29:23.803
I don't mean that.

29:24.971 --> 29:26.097
I mean you and me.

29:29.851 --> 29:31.478
Do we have to talk about that?

29:33.730 --> 29:35.023
What else is there?

29:37.233 --> 29:38.151
Anything?

29:38.234 --> 29:39.986
Talk about the weather...

29:40.987 --> 29:41.905
or...

29:43.615 --> 29:44.532
music...

29:45.742 --> 29:47.494
or this overpriced hotel room.

29:48.036 --> 29:49.788
Yeah, we're splitting this, right?

30:04.677 --> 30:06.471
I hate that we have to choose a side.

30:08.139 --> 30:12.477
They say the only choice between
love and war is which will kill you first.

30:14.938 --> 30:16.189
Where have I heard that before?

30:19.067 --> 30:20.777
Probably a classroom.

30:30.078 --> 30:30.995
Clear.

30:33.289 --> 30:36.459
Ah, thank you, medicum.

30:37.043 --> 30:40.213
Or wait, it's "acolyte" now, isn't it?

30:44.884 --> 30:45.718
Where are they?

30:46.344 --> 30:47.929
Maybe they knew we were coming.

30:48.012 --> 30:49.097
There's nothing here.

30:49.264 --> 30:51.474
Well, then there's nothing for us to do.

30:52.058 --> 30:53.560
We're done. Everybody out.

30:53.643 --> 30:55.353
<i>Porta rescindatur ut vis fluat.</i>

30:57.105 --> 30:59.858
Would it kill you to use
a little fabric softener with this?

31:00.483 --> 31:01.526
You're leaving?

31:01.609 --> 31:03.236
I thought this was a raid.

31:03.319 --> 31:05.697
Well, I thought so, too, but look around.

31:06.030 --> 31:07.240
I know a tracing spell,

31:07.323 --> 31:09.742
as long as they were here
in the last 15 minutes.

31:09.826 --> 31:11.661
Oh. Worth a try.

31:13.496 --> 31:15.748
Damn, I wanted to see
more werewolf action.

31:15.832 --> 31:17.041
That was thrilling.

31:17.125 --> 31:19.335
-I told you to leave.
-Wha--?

31:19.961 --> 31:22.755
Yes, it's so thrilling
having your eye clawed out.

31:22.839 --> 31:24.007
-Uh...

31:27.093 --> 31:29.345
-Uh, Bitsy?

31:34.642 --> 31:37.061
-I didn't know that would happen.
-Who expects a double-cross

31:37.145 --> 31:39.188
-when you conspire with the enemy?
-I didn't conspire.

31:39.272 --> 31:40.940
Bennett died. Horribly.

31:41.566 --> 31:43.484
And that's on you
for giving this info to Praxis.

31:43.568 --> 31:45.528
How do you know
they even caused that eruption?

31:45.945 --> 31:48.531
Because they cause them all.
They gave magic to the masses

31:48.615 --> 31:50.241
and they're trying to start
the apocalypse.

31:53.620 --> 31:54.495
Hey.

31:56.122 --> 31:57.415
Everything all right?

31:57.498 --> 31:58.917
- I'm fine.
-You sure?

31:59.000 --> 31:59.876
Mm.

31:59.959 --> 32:01.002
You seem more

32:01.461 --> 32:02.503
Gabrielle than usual.

32:02.587 --> 32:04.422
Which makes me better than fine.

32:04.797 --> 32:06.132
And since when do you even care?

32:06.215 --> 32:07.050
Hey.

32:07.926 --> 32:08.885
I do care...

32:10.011 --> 32:10.970
when you let me.

32:11.054 --> 32:12.096
Oh, please.

32:12.805 --> 32:14.265
I know what's happening.

32:15.141 --> 32:17.602
You're gonna get Lilith back
and you're gonna be a happy family,

32:18.311 --> 32:20.063
and you can go back
to pining all over her,

32:20.146 --> 32:22.565
and I'll just be that super hot girl
with the great hair

32:22.649 --> 32:24.400
who isn't good enough
to be in the wolf pack.

32:24.484 --> 32:25.401
Would you stop?

32:25.485 --> 32:27.820
You're plenty good enough, you're just...

32:28.947 --> 32:30.406
You're just too insecure to see it.

32:31.157 --> 32:33.409
Too bossy, too stuck up, too insecure.

32:34.118 --> 32:35.411
I guess I can never win, can I?

32:36.871 --> 32:38.915
-That's not what I meant.
-Your attention, please.

32:44.754 --> 32:46.881
Counselor Kepler has an announcement.

32:55.014 --> 32:57.475
Following the ambush at the last raid...

32:59.227 --> 33:00.103
and the...

33:01.980 --> 33:04.232
gruesome death of...

33:05.400 --> 33:06.901
Councilor Bennett,

33:06.985 --> 33:11.406
the Gnostic Council
hereby grants the Grand Magus the right

33:12.115 --> 33:13.157
of Imperium.

33:15.952 --> 33:18.496
Praxis is a threat

33:19.288 --> 33:20.415
to this Order,

33:20.999 --> 33:23.960
to Belgrave, to civilization.

33:24.544 --> 33:27.880
The time has come
for swift and decisive action.

33:31.968 --> 33:33.845
Prepare for the<i> Obcidione Caedo.</i>

33:42.770 --> 33:44.355
It means "the annihilation."

33:45.440 --> 33:47.400
- They know what it means.

33:48.443 --> 33:49.610
You have to get out of here.

33:49.694 --> 33:50.862
Get as far as you can.

33:50.945 --> 33:53.072
You never should have caused
that eruption.

33:53.656 --> 33:56.075
-Eruption? What are you talking about?
-That Tartarus eruption.

33:56.159 --> 33:58.578
The one you activated
when we raided your headquarters.

33:58.870 --> 34:01.581
God, I wish I could weaponize
those things.

34:02.206 --> 34:04.459
This whole fight would've been over
months ago.

34:04.959 --> 34:06.252
We're looking for something else.

34:06.919 --> 34:09.797
Something I believe is in
your Grand Magus's possession.

34:09.881 --> 34:11.716
Call the search off,
because the Order's coming,

34:11.799 --> 34:13.926
- and they're coming hard.
-Vera wants to kill you both.

34:14.010 --> 34:14.927
She can't kill me,

34:15.011 --> 34:16.220
not as long as Praxis lives.

34:16.304 --> 34:19.515
Damn it, Alyssa, the Gnostic Council
just gave Vera total authority

34:19.599 --> 34:20.808
to do whatever she wants.

34:20.892 --> 34:22.560
A lot of people are about to die.

34:22.643 --> 34:25.688
You can't have magic for the masses
if everyone is dead.

34:30.234 --> 34:31.819
You think there's another path?

34:31.903 --> 34:33.029
Negotiate.

34:33.112 --> 34:36.115
You want some spell,
and we need the eruptions to stop.

34:36.199 --> 34:37.283
-A parley.
-Yeah.

34:38.076 --> 34:39.660
Salvador and Vera bound together.

34:39.744 --> 34:43.206
You can talk in safety,
and just maybe find a way to peace.

34:46.834 --> 34:48.377
My father would have liked you.

34:49.128 --> 34:50.838
He was always trying to save the world.

34:52.548 --> 34:53.925
And it almost killed him.

34:57.428 --> 35:00.473
I'll agree to a parley,
as long as your Grand Magus will.

35:01.641 --> 35:02.683
In the meantime...

35:04.185 --> 35:06.521
<i>-Monstrate!</i>

35:08.981 --> 35:10.566
Consider this my gesture of goodwill.

35:14.737 --> 35:15.780
We'll be in touch.

35:25.039 --> 35:26.874
W-- Wait a minute. There's five of--

35:40.471 --> 35:43.891
But if this is Midnight,
then what hide is Salvador wearing?

35:47.103 --> 35:48.229
Timber's locker is empty.

35:49.147 --> 35:50.606
So technically Salvador--

35:50.690 --> 35:52.900
No, she can't, because Lilith isn't dead.

35:57.196 --> 35:58.614
Salvador must be Alpha.

35:59.407 --> 36:00.575
Alpha? Who the hell is Alpha?

36:00.658 --> 36:03.327
Right, you were dead when we learned that.

36:03.411 --> 36:07.248
Okay, so Alpha is the hide that
this guy named Grafton Davis wore

36:07.331 --> 36:10.168
when he defeated Jurgen Sawyer
and tore apart the Vade Maecum.

36:10.835 --> 36:13.796
After that, he just disappeared
and took the hide with him, so...

36:15.214 --> 36:16.048
That's it.

36:16.632 --> 36:18.176
Salvador's Alpha,

36:18.259 --> 36:21.179
Lilith is Timber, Timber's in Hell,
we're saving her.

36:21.512 --> 36:22.972
Yeah, after we get the Order on board

36:23.055 --> 36:25.600
and stop everyone from destroying
the world and killing each other.

36:25.683 --> 36:27.226
Dude, we need to do this now.

36:27.310 --> 36:29.145
No, what we need to do is grow up

36:29.228 --> 36:32.190
and take responsibility for our actions
and learn to work together.

36:32.273 --> 36:36.360
Look, I don't know about you, but I'm
tired of screwing up and hurting people.

36:38.529 --> 36:39.363
Okay.

36:40.531 --> 36:41.741
So, what's the plan?

36:42.909 --> 36:44.410
First, I go to the Grand Magus

36:44.493 --> 36:47.413
and convince her to parley with Salvador,
all right?

36:47.496 --> 36:49.957
And she'll be so grateful
that she will help us get Lilith back.

36:50.041 --> 36:50.958
"Grateful."

36:51.959 --> 36:54.712
Sure, that totally sounds like Vera Stone.

36:54.795 --> 36:56.839
Give me one day, okay?

36:56.923 --> 36:58.799
Then we'll get Lilith back,
no matter what.

37:00.843 --> 37:02.887
You negotiated behind my back?

37:02.970 --> 37:04.222
Are you out of your mind?

37:04.680 --> 37:05.598
What were you thinking?

37:05.681 --> 37:07.308
Hey, I did this to help you.

37:07.391 --> 37:09.894
I'm trying to give you a way out
that doesn't involve some sort of

37:10.394 --> 37:11.562
magic genocide.

37:12.438 --> 37:13.481
You should thank me.

37:13.564 --> 37:15.358
I should feed you to a leprechaun.

37:15.441 --> 37:17.985
You know, you're really starting
to remind me of my father.

37:19.195 --> 37:21.364
I am nothing like Edward Coventry.

37:22.323 --> 37:25.952
This gives us a chance to stop
the eruptions, and no one has to die.

37:27.578 --> 37:31.082
You want to be a different kind of leader,
create a new Order.

37:31.165 --> 37:33.793
And I believe in you,
and I'm not the only one.

37:45.221 --> 37:46.138
Fine.

37:47.807 --> 37:50.101
Make the arrangements.
I'll need to prepare.

37:50.184 --> 37:51.394
Thank you, Grand Magus.

37:51.978 --> 37:53.437
I promise you won't regret it.

37:53.521 --> 37:55.022
Be careful, Mr. Morton.

37:55.439 --> 37:57.275
Don't make promises you can't keep.

38:11.664 --> 38:13.666
I think that this is a mistake.

38:14.542 --> 38:17.545
We have to stop the eruptions
before they get out of control.

38:18.212 --> 38:20.798
If I can do that
without resorting to murder,

38:20.881 --> 38:21.757
all the better.

38:21.841 --> 38:23.843
I've been researching the Cretian loom.

38:24.135 --> 38:27.471
I have a theory that, with a few
modifications to the portal incantation,

38:27.555 --> 38:29.307
we can use it to close an eruption.

38:31.225 --> 38:33.436
I don't have time for your theories.

38:36.814 --> 38:38.274
You can see yourself out.

38:47.325 --> 38:48.200
Gabrielle.

38:49.118 --> 38:52.121
At Praxis headquarters, you had a bag
for the Magus. What was in it?

38:52.204 --> 38:54.415
You're the right-hand man. Go and ask her.

38:55.249 --> 38:56.083
Um...

38:56.792 --> 38:58.002
You sure you didn't peek?

38:58.085 --> 39:00.338
Why would I? Nobody cares what I think.

39:00.421 --> 39:02.965
Apparently, I'm only good
to carry water and chop wood, so...

39:04.258 --> 39:06.344
After the eruption,
what happened to the bag?

39:06.427 --> 39:07.803
How should I know?

39:08.012 --> 39:09.680
Okay. Thanks for your help.

39:11.682 --> 39:12.558
Gabrielle.

39:13.309 --> 39:14.685
-Are you busy?
-Are you kidding me?

39:14.769 --> 39:16.437
Does anyone have classes anymore?

39:16.520 --> 39:17.521
Hi. Sorry.

39:17.605 --> 39:19.315
I just thought you could help me
find an owl.

39:19.398 --> 39:22.318
What? Ew. No. Why? Ew.

39:23.402 --> 39:25.780
We're saving Lilith.
The Knights got her...

39:26.655 --> 39:29.909
hide locker, so that means we can use it
to pull her out of the demon realm.

39:30.534 --> 39:33.204
You're saying the only way to get her back
is with some stupid box?

39:33.287 --> 39:34.830
I know. Magic, right?

39:36.207 --> 39:37.041
I should go.

39:37.124 --> 39:40.086
Uh, I guess I'll see you later?
We should have a party when she gets back.

39:41.962 --> 39:43.214
<i>If</i> she gets back.

39:55.518 --> 39:56.477
I know who you are.

39:57.144 --> 39:58.145
You're Alpha.

39:58.729 --> 40:00.272
Where did you get the hide?

40:01.107 --> 40:02.733
They feel a little loose.

40:04.860 --> 40:09.657
<i>Hae animae ligentur ligeturque haec caro.</i>

40:10.658 --> 40:11.575
Allow me.

40:21.502 --> 40:22.920
The binding is complete.

40:28.092 --> 40:29.218
Play nice.

40:44.608 --> 40:46.861
All this beauty and creativity,

40:47.528 --> 40:49.321
and they just keep it locked away.

40:50.823 --> 40:53.200
Perhaps they're trying to protect it.

40:54.827 --> 40:56.078
Art has a purpose.

40:57.329 --> 41:00.374
To be seen and shared
and given to the world.

41:01.417 --> 41:06.297
Well, art, and magic
aren't the same thing.

41:06.714 --> 41:09.216
I know a million artists
who would disagree with you.

41:10.342 --> 41:12.928
And the worst thing
you can do with either...

41:15.097 --> 41:16.265
is to hoard it.

41:16.348 --> 41:18.934
Just cut to the chase.
Tell me what you want.

41:22.062 --> 41:23.397
The <i>Fors Factoram.</i>

41:28.235 --> 41:29.570
Did I say something funny?

41:31.697 --> 41:32.573
Hello?

41:34.366 --> 41:35.367
Randall?

41:38.162 --> 41:39.330
Anyone here?

42:00.684 --> 42:01.519
No.

42:02.811 --> 42:03.979
I'm better than this.

42:05.523 --> 42:07.942
I'm Gabrielle-fucking-Dupres.

42:08.025 --> 42:09.527
It should be enough, damn it.

42:51.235 --> 42:52.570
They've been in there a while.

42:53.445 --> 42:55.906
Yeah, well, I mean,
they're probably best friends by now.

42:56.699 --> 42:58.576
Braiding each other's hair,
that sort of thing.

43:07.209 --> 43:08.043
So...

43:09.211 --> 43:11.589
what happens after this?

43:11.672 --> 43:13.757
I thought you didn't
want to talk about it.

43:14.341 --> 43:17.303
Yeah, well, that was before
I thought we had a chance.

43:18.178 --> 43:21.140
Now, things are different.

43:21.223 --> 43:22.057
Yeah.

43:22.516 --> 43:25.728
We might even get to be
on the same side for a change.

43:28.772 --> 43:30.024
Maybe Salvador's wrong.

43:30.107 --> 43:32.401
We won't have to choose
between love and war.

43:33.736 --> 43:34.903
Wait, Salvador said that?

43:36.363 --> 43:37.906
Something her father used to say.

43:38.574 --> 43:40.659
"The only choice
between love and war is--"

43:40.743 --> 43:43.120
"Which will kill you first."
I know, we discussed it in class.

43:43.746 --> 43:46.957
The last words of the Lycaon,
the first werewolf.

43:48.125 --> 43:48.959
So?

43:49.043 --> 43:52.755
So Lycaon's daughter, Psophis,
wanted to avenge her father's death.

43:52.838 --> 43:55.007
So she lured the gods into a trap

43:55.090 --> 43:57.301
and then she killed herself
to destroy them. That's...

43:58.135 --> 44:00.596
That's how Salvador got Alpha's hide.
She's his daughter.

44:00.679 --> 44:02.014
-Whose daughter?
-Grafton Davis,

44:02.097 --> 44:03.849
a former Knight
and the Lycaon to her Psophis.

44:03.932 --> 44:05.351
We have to break that binding spell.

44:05.434 --> 44:07.227
-What? No, we can't.

44:07.311 --> 44:10.481
The <i>Fors Factoram</i>
is the Order's greatest secret.

44:10.564 --> 44:14.652
Only the Grand Magus and the adepti
are ever granted access to its power.

44:14.735 --> 44:16.820
And yet, those are my terms.

44:17.821 --> 44:21.533
Well, then, pardon my French,
but your terms can fuck right off.

44:21.867 --> 44:24.078
Then Praxis will keep distributing magic

44:24.161 --> 44:27.289
and training people until there are
too many of us for you to fight.

44:27.373 --> 44:29.500
And the eruptions will
keep getting bigger,

44:29.583 --> 44:32.503
and you'll end up causing the apocalypse.

44:33.128 --> 44:35.631
All the more reason for you
to give me what I want.

44:37.216 --> 44:39.802
I'd rather watch the world burn.

44:45.307 --> 44:47.768
I read about this special
kind of pine tree.

44:48.268 --> 44:50.187
Its seeds only grow after a forest fire.

44:50.270 --> 44:51.647
Let me guess.

44:52.106 --> 44:53.565
You're the fire?

44:53.649 --> 44:54.858
Mm.

44:54.942 --> 44:55.859
I'm the tree.

44:57.194 --> 44:59.947
And a new world will grow
because of my sacrifice.

45:00.864 --> 45:02.700
A world with no inequality,

45:03.325 --> 45:05.619
no hunger, no pain.

45:06.245 --> 45:08.288
If you surrender peacefully,

45:08.831 --> 45:12.334
you won't have to speak of yourself
in the past tense.

45:14.712 --> 45:15.879
Jack Morton was right.

45:16.964 --> 45:17.965
You'll never give up,

45:18.507 --> 45:20.092
and so long as you survive,

45:20.467 --> 45:21.468
Praxis won't.

45:31.937 --> 45:32.896
Salvador, stop!

45:39.528 --> 45:40.404
No!

45:53.292 --> 45:54.251
How did you know?

45:54.334 --> 45:57.755
I didn't know, but I prepared.

46:00.340 --> 46:03.177
Miss Drake, surrender now. It's all over.

46:04.261 --> 46:05.429
Nothing's over.

46:06.346 --> 46:07.431
Miss Drake, put the knife down.

46:08.182 --> 46:10.517
<i>Haec forma et omnia quae noto plicentur.</i>

46:19.109 --> 46:21.278
Is this what you meant when you said
dark days are ahead?

46:22.529 --> 46:23.614
Pretty much.
