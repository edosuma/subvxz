00:03.036 --> 00:05.003
A child molester turns
to the kid and says,

00:05.038 --> 00:08.041
"What are you scared about?
I gotta walk outta here alone."

00:08.076 --> 00:11.509
That's sick, Tommy.
That is sick.

00:11.544 --> 00:15.548
Get a shot of Lou dancing.
Just give me the camera.

00:18.051 --> 00:20.553
Oh, yeah! Huh?

00:28.061 --> 00:31.398
Oh, yeah! Huh?

00:33.000 --> 00:39.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

01:09.169 --> 01:11.037
Tom, hey.

01:13.973 --> 01:16.876
Where are you, Tommy?

01:20.713 --> 01:23.783
Are you here, Tommy?
Tommy? Hello?

01:24.017 --> 01:26.052
Paulie, what are you
doing here?

01:26.087 --> 01:29.421
Tommy! Yea!
Hey, man.

01:29.456 --> 01:31.791
What's going on?
Someone knocked on my door.

01:32.025 --> 01:33.560
It's okay. No problem.

01:34.060 --> 01:35.562
Can I help you?
You're old.

01:36.062 --> 01:38.465
How many doors did you knock on?
It's just my son. No problem.

01:38.500 --> 01:40.633
Sorry.
Now who are you?

01:40.867 --> 01:43.403
I'm stayin' at a friend's
apartment for a couple of days.

01:43.670 --> 01:45.972
- I'm lookin' into this.
- So am I.

01:46.473 --> 01:48.206
Kiss my balls!
Oh!

01:48.241 --> 01:51.978
What? Are you tryin' to get
me kicked out? Huh? Jesus!

01:52.013 --> 01:53.945
I was at the house
last night,

01:53.980 --> 01:56.983
and some of the guys were sayin'
how maybe you might be leavin'.

01:57.018 --> 01:59.451
Okay, first of all, that's
not necessarily true, okay?

01:59.486 --> 02:02.822
So I took the first ferry here,
because you can't go, Tommy. You can't.

02:02.857 --> 02:05.325
If you go, I have to go
with you. You took the ferry?

02:05.360 --> 02:07.792
I can do that.
Really?

02:07.827 --> 02:10.562
Don't tell my mom, okay?
Yeah.

02:10.597 --> 02:13.333
Am I really your son, Tommy?

02:13.833 --> 02:15.800
No, you're not
my son, Paulie.

02:15.835 --> 02:18.338
Am I really a firefighter?
Here, give me that.

02:18.373 --> 02:22.307
You're an honorary firefighter. Yea.

02:22.342 --> 02:24.594
You really leavin', Tommy?
I don't know, Paulie.

02:24.629 --> 02:26.846
I'm just talkin' to some guys
about the possibility.

02:26.881 --> 02:29.147
Maybe I can live with you,
since I'm your son.

02:29.182 --> 02:31.983
Okay, I already have
a son, all right?

02:32.018 --> 02:35.021
What if something happens to
him? Nothing's gonna happen. Yeah?

02:35.056 --> 02:38.823
Hi. It's me. I need to
see you. What's wrong?

02:38.858 --> 02:42.862
It's an emergency. Can you
just come now? Is it the baby?

02:42.897 --> 02:46.699
No. It's about us.

02:46.734 --> 02:49.334
Give me that.

02:49.369 --> 02:52.670
What? Ow! Ow! I'll be
there in half an hour.

02:52.705 --> 02:56.209
Don't answer that. And don't
play with any more matches.

02:56.244 --> 02:58.676
Son of a bitch.

02:58.711 --> 03:01.446
And then Damien finishes
his tuna roll,

03:01.481 --> 03:03.848
and then you and I get
in this big argument...

03:03.883 --> 03:06.886
about whether or not it's okay
to go swimming after you eat.

03:06.921 --> 03:09.722
I say it ain't, you say it is,
and, as usual, you win.

03:09.757 --> 03:11.689
So then he goes running off
to the water,

03:11.724 --> 03:14.727
and then you take the opportunity to
tell me you don't wanna see me anymore.

03:14.762 --> 03:18.064
You just say that it's over,
and it was so awful!

03:18.431 --> 03:21.401
So I woke up,
and I was shaking, and I was--

03:23.736 --> 03:27.740
This is the emergency you had to have
me come over to help you deal with?

03:27.974 --> 03:31.309
Yeah. An emotional
emergency.

03:31.344 --> 03:35.582
Do me a favor. Next time call
the Hormone Hotline, okay?

03:35.617 --> 03:39.217
Hey, retard, I got neighbors!

03:39.252 --> 03:41.754
- Sorry.
- He really is retarded.

03:41.789 --> 03:43.923
- Really?
- Yeah.

03:44.157 --> 03:46.593
- Sorry!
- What?

03:46.993 --> 03:49.394
Shut up. You know,
I have to go to work.

03:49.429 --> 03:52.599
I have to come over the bridge. I
have to drop him off. Blah, blah, blah.

03:52.634 --> 03:55.567
Oh, I'm sorry.
Am I an inconvenience to you?

03:55.602 --> 03:59.105
Oh, yeah. I just must be a big,
fat inconvenience to you, right?

03:59.140 --> 04:01.072
Unless, of course, you've
got no place else to go...

04:01.107 --> 04:03.876
or you're lonely or you're lookin'
for a place to park your cock!

04:03.911 --> 04:06.578
Talk to you later.
Oh, that's perfect!

04:06.613 --> 04:09.282
There's a picture I can't get
enough of-- you walkin' away! Hey!

04:09.782 --> 04:13.786
You have a responsibility here. Too bad
you're not man enough to handle it, right?

04:13.821 --> 04:17.088
You big pussy!

04:17.123 --> 04:20.925
You got a girlfriend,
Paulie?

04:20.959 --> 04:24.464
Looks like
I'm the retarded one.

04:31.137 --> 04:34.038
On another day
C'mon, c'mon

04:34.073 --> 04:37.477
With these ropes I tied
can we do no wrong

04:37.877 --> 04:40.612
Now we grieve
'cause now is gone

04:40.647 --> 04:43.615
Things were good
when we were young

04:43.650 --> 04:46.986
With my teeth locked down
I can see the blood

04:47.021 --> 04:50.323
Of a thousand men
who have come and gone

04:50.358 --> 04:53.791
Now we grieve
'cause now is gone

04:53.826 --> 04:56.763
Things were good
when we were young

04:56.996 --> 04:59.964
Is it safe to say
C'mon, c'mon

04:59.999 --> 05:03.169
Was it right to leave
C'mon, c'mon

05:03.204 --> 05:06.606
Will I ever learn
C'mon, c'mon

05:06.641 --> 05:10.009
C'mon, c'mon
c'mon, c'mon

05:15.848 --> 05:18.685
Oh! Oh, yeah! Yeah!

05:18.918 --> 05:22.104
Yeah, that's unbelievable
right there.

05:22.139 --> 05:25.256
Oh! Oh, yes!
What the hell's this?

05:25.291 --> 05:30.363
Oh, hey, Franco. Just the greatest
massage I've ever had in my life.

05:30.398 --> 05:32.497
You okay?
Yeah. It hurts good.

05:32.532 --> 05:35.868
Jesus! You gotta do this, Frank.
You're the one with the bad shoulder.

05:35.903 --> 05:38.388
Personal rule--
I only get massaged by chicks,

05:38.423 --> 05:40.873
and only when the massage
ain't the main event.

05:41.374 --> 05:44.377
Are you sayin' I'm gay? No. What I'm sayin'
is there's a first time for everything,

05:44.877 --> 05:48.147
and rubbing your hands all over another guy
is an obvious trigger for setting it off.

05:48.182 --> 05:49.882
I don't think so, bro.

05:50.383 --> 05:53.219
I learned this from a chick I
was banging a couple years ago.

05:53.254 --> 05:55.555
She was a professional
massage therapist.

05:55.955 --> 05:58.491
She taught me everything
she knew. Everything.

05:58.526 --> 06:01.459
Oh, God.
It feels so good, you know?

06:01.494 --> 06:03.961
I feel like one of those
deer in the meadow--

06:03.996 --> 06:06.332
you know, with the flowers
and the birds and shit.

06:06.632 --> 06:09.569
Okay, I'm done.
Here. Come on. You try it.

06:09.604 --> 06:11.536
You're up. It's so great.

06:11.571 --> 06:14.407
No, thanks. There's only room for
one little deer in the meadow today.

06:14.442 --> 06:16.409
No, come on.
It'll take two seconds.

06:16.809 --> 06:18.911
He's freaked out.
Leave him alone.

06:19.412 --> 06:21.914
I am not freaked out.
Well, then do it.

06:21.949 --> 06:24.917
Two seconds.
Yeah!

06:26.419 --> 06:29.422
Your hands stay
from the nipples up.

06:29.457 --> 06:31.924
That's it.
No problem.

06:32.425 --> 06:34.927
I think I was clear the first
time this came up, Lieutenant.

06:34.962 --> 06:36.894
I'm not discussing
it again.

06:36.929 --> 06:39.397
Listen, Tommy
knows he screwed up.

06:39.432 --> 06:42.435
You know, he's making an effort. He's
trying to change some things in his life.

06:42.935 --> 06:44.437
You can't give him
another shot?

06:44.937 --> 06:47.940
I'd love to give him a shot. Right
between the eyes. The crew wants him back.

06:47.975 --> 06:50.777
If this were a democracy, that
actually might mean something.

06:51.010 --> 06:52.879
By the way,
I doubt it.

06:53.179 --> 06:55.680
You're telling me they'd
choose Gavin over Sully?

06:55.715 --> 06:58.750
Sully with the great cooking? Sully
with the great stories, the jokes?

06:58.785 --> 07:02.121
I think that the crew, if push came
to shove-- Tell you what. Take a vote.

07:02.156 --> 07:05.725
If the whole crew chooses Gavin
over Sully, I'll sign his transfer.

07:05.760 --> 07:09.295
I'm gonna hold you to that, Chief.
You'll never get the whole crew.

07:09.330 --> 07:12.465
Franco won't go for it.
The girl-- Face it.

07:12.500 --> 07:15.468
Gavin's through here.

07:17.470 --> 07:19.472
Prick.

07:23.743 --> 07:25.710
Exciting call, huh?

07:25.745 --> 07:28.212
Oh, yeah. I think
I need another nap.

07:28.247 --> 07:30.082
Yeah?
What do you want?

07:30.349 --> 07:32.151
- Nice greeting.
- You called me.

07:32.652 --> 07:35.655
I'm calling you back, asshole, which is
more than you deserve. What do you want?

07:35.690 --> 07:38.623
Yeah. I want to know if you
heard anything about Uncle Teddy.

07:38.658 --> 07:42.495
Yeah, I got bad news. I sent some of my
guys to check out the place he was living.

07:42.530 --> 07:44.497
Looks like
it's been ransacked.

07:44.997 --> 07:46.999
That doesn't mean shit. His
place always looks ransacked.

07:47.034 --> 07:49.467
Well, be that as it may,
I hate to say this.

07:49.502 --> 07:52.772
- All indications are that Teddy got whacked.
- Shit. You're kidding.

07:52.807 --> 07:55.325
- Yeah, it's rough, right?
- Poor guy.

07:55.360 --> 07:57.809
Yeah, well, here's
the kicker. Dad's back.

07:57.844 --> 08:00.346
Ann Marie talked to him, and
he's staying at-- get this--

08:00.847 --> 08:02.348
A Park Avenue address.

08:02.849 --> 08:05.852
No shit. Where? Go find
him yourself, dick face.

08:08.688 --> 08:11.589
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:11.624 --> 08:14.592
- Hey, guys. What's up?
- Hi.

08:14.627 --> 08:16.761
Hey, Laura, would you mind
sitting with Keela tonight?

08:16.796 --> 08:20.533
No. I got plans. I'm going out
with a bunch of friends tonight.

08:20.568 --> 08:23.000
I'll be home by 9:00.

08:23.035 --> 08:27.039
I love Keela, and I'm so glad I could help
you guys out the past couple of months,

08:27.540 --> 08:30.543
um, but I kinda have
a life of my own too.

08:31.043 --> 08:33.546
I really can't do it.
I'm sorry.

08:34.046 --> 08:38.818
Well, look, Laura. Please?
Hey, I'll pay for your drinks.

08:38.852 --> 08:40.518
Excuse me?

08:40.553 --> 08:42.554
Yeah, you know, when you go out
with your friends after.

08:42.590 --> 08:45.057
Whatever you spend on booze,
I'll reimburse you.

08:45.092 --> 08:47.560
Oh, honey, you just made
a huge mistake.

08:47.595 --> 08:51.362
Huge mistake.

08:51.397 --> 08:53.399
You dig that massage,
brother?

08:53.434 --> 08:55.401
Uh, yeah, it was great.

08:59.405 --> 09:02.408
My man is deep in thought.

09:02.443 --> 09:05.376
Anybody home?
Oh, hey, Sully.

09:05.411 --> 09:07.413
You havin' trouble
with the knob polisher?

09:07.448 --> 09:10.100
The what?
The girlfriend.

09:10.135 --> 09:12.717
Ah, no.
Everything's cool.

09:12.752 --> 09:16.888
Don't lie to Sully, kid.
Sully's seen it all.

09:16.923 --> 09:21.427
Sully's done it all. Sully has
had it all done to him. Spill.

09:22.929 --> 09:26.933
She dumped me.
Nobody knows.

09:26.968 --> 09:30.401
Ouch. That hurts.

09:30.436 --> 09:33.439
Hurts enough when a regular
chick gives you the gate.

09:33.474 --> 09:37.443
Getting dumped by a tubster?
You poor bastard.

09:37.478 --> 09:40.411
No wonder you haven't
told anybody.

09:40.446 --> 09:44.951
I don't know what to do, Sully.
I think I'm in love with her.

09:44.986 --> 09:46.918
It hurts so bad.

09:46.953 --> 09:49.956
So what are you gonna do? Just
mope around? Is that the plan?

09:49.991 --> 09:53.960
She's got somebody else.
Because you're allowing it.

09:53.995 --> 09:56.928
We're talking
about love here, son.

09:56.963 --> 10:01.933
Love's a war. You gotta get in
there and fight. Take no prisoners.

10:01.968 --> 10:05.972
I mean, other than her. Because in
this case, she would be a prisoner.

10:06.007 --> 10:09.976
So forget that last thing I'm
saying. Are you gonna be a man or not?

10:10.011 --> 10:14.445
You're right.
Thanks, Sully.

10:14.480 --> 10:17.483
Hey, I'm always
here for you, kid.

10:21.487 --> 10:24.323
All right, everybody here?
Where's the probie?

10:24.358 --> 10:26.791
Hey, probie, get in here! Where's Sully?

10:26.826 --> 10:29.495
He's in the kitchen making
dinner. Any idea what he's making?

10:29.530 --> 10:31.163
No. Probie!
Sorry.

10:31.530 --> 10:32.999
Get your ass in here,
all right?

10:33.499 --> 10:35.466
All right, look.
Here's the deal.

10:35.501 --> 10:39.005
Jerry and I have been talking to
Tommy, and he wants to transfer back.

10:39.040 --> 10:41.305
Great.
Just what we need.

10:41.340 --> 10:45.511
Let me finish, all right? Tommy's trying
to clean up his act. He's joined A.A.

10:45.745 --> 10:48.145
- That's no guarantee.
- Let him finish, Frank.

10:48.180 --> 10:51.016
Hey, Sean, screw you, okay?
You're not the guy who got burned.

10:51.051 --> 10:53.853
You're not the guy who almost
got killed. Lou, I'm sorry.

10:53.888 --> 10:56.289
I know you guys
go way back and all that.

10:56.324 --> 10:58.691
I don't want him here.
End of discussion.

10:58.726 --> 11:01.158
No surprise there.

11:01.193 --> 11:04.161
What I need to know-- because
this might have an impact--

11:04.196 --> 11:07.466
is if you had to choose between
Tommy and Sully, who would it be?

11:07.767 --> 11:09.568
So, we're, like,
gonna vote?

11:09.603 --> 11:11.370
Yeah.
We're gonna do it now?

11:11.604 --> 11:14.473
Yeah. Well, maybe I should get
a hat and some slips of paper.

11:14.508 --> 11:16.709
It's not some goddamn
game of charades, Garrity.

11:16.744 --> 11:19.211
Tommy or Sully?
It's that easy.

11:19.246 --> 11:22.214
Now, I vote Tommy. Jer?

11:22.249 --> 11:24.233
Tommy.

11:24.268 --> 11:26.218
Sully.

11:27.553 --> 11:29.388
Sully.

11:32.725 --> 11:35.728
Sorry, guys. Sully.

11:44.403 --> 11:46.906
Can I talk to you?
Yeah. Shoot.

11:48.908 --> 11:51.876
It's about Tommy.
Huh.

11:51.911 --> 11:55.915
Look, you know I want him
back in the house, right?

11:55.950 --> 11:59.251
The guy's maybe
my best friend in the world.

11:59.752 --> 12:02.755
Perrolli's busting my balls saying
I gotta get the whole crew to agree.

12:03.255 --> 12:08.594
I think I can turn everyone around,
but they're taking their cue from you.

12:08.828 --> 12:11.847
Yeah, well, Lou, I know Tommy's your
best friend. I think that's great.

12:11.882 --> 12:14.867
But your best friend almost got
my ass roasted. He made a mistake.

12:14.902 --> 12:17.436
Yeah, kind of a major one
from my personal perspective.

12:19.939 --> 12:23.943
He needs this, Franco. You
probably don't see it like that.

12:23.978 --> 12:26.378
The guy's
such a cocky prick.

12:26.879 --> 12:29.346
He's got nothing.

12:29.381 --> 12:32.384
His wife and kids--

12:34.386 --> 12:36.854
We're his brothers.

12:36.889 --> 12:40.893
You really think this is the right
time to turn our backs on him?

12:40.928 --> 12:43.729
I can't change
how I feel.

12:46.232 --> 12:48.300
Think about it.

12:51.804 --> 12:54.271
But also...

12:54.306 --> 12:57.810
think about all the times
you walked into an ugly fire...

12:58.310 --> 13:00.813
and it was okay because
Tommy Gavin had your back.

13:01.046 --> 13:03.547
Maybe you
can write a guy off...

13:03.582 --> 13:07.987
for makin' one mistake after
20 years of meritorious service.

13:08.022 --> 13:09.822
I can't.

13:10.322 --> 13:12.824
It's balls, Franco.

13:12.859 --> 13:15.292
It's all about balls.

13:15.327 --> 13:18.831
Tommy's got the biggest pair
I ever seen.

13:26.839 --> 13:28.674
Yeah.

13:33.179 --> 13:35.479
Just come upstairs
for 10 minutes.

13:35.514 --> 13:38.517
God, you are so hot.
Just come upstairs.

13:38.552 --> 13:41.986
I can't.
I gotta go.

13:42.021 --> 13:46.025
Hey, do you have any more of
those-- What are they called?

13:46.525 --> 13:49.994
What? You know, those pain
pills you scored for me.

13:50.029 --> 13:53.032
Vicodin? Yeah. Yeah. Vicodin.
Can you get me some more of those?

13:53.067 --> 13:56.001
Are you only into me
because of the drugs?

13:56.036 --> 13:57.868
What?
You heard me.

13:57.903 --> 14:01.338
You know what? Forget
about it. It doesn't matter.

14:01.373 --> 14:04.376
I can get you-- No, no. Forget
about it. I can deal with the pain.

14:04.411 --> 14:07.344
If it's gonna make you
think something like that--

14:07.379 --> 14:10.465
I don't wanna mess up this
thing we've got going, okay?

14:10.500 --> 14:13.552
I'll get-- I'll get you more.
I can do it tomorrow, okay?

14:13.587 --> 14:15.554
I'm sorry.

14:17.556 --> 14:19.558
You're forgiven.

14:23.562 --> 14:26.065
If, uh-- If you could get me a
higher dosage, that'd be great.

14:31.737 --> 14:35.206
Theresa. Hey.

14:35.241 --> 14:38.244
What are you doing here?
I followed you.

14:39.745 --> 14:42.498
I need to talk
to her alone.

14:42.533 --> 14:45.251
Uh, give us
a couple seconds.

14:45.286 --> 14:47.218
Okay.

14:47.253 --> 14:50.721
You followed me here?

14:50.756 --> 14:53.759
You gotta tell your friend it's over,
'cause we're in love, and that's it.

14:53.794 --> 14:56.262
If you don't wanna tell him,
I'll handle it.

14:56.297 --> 15:00.231
Mike, it's over, okay?
Just let it go.

15:00.266 --> 15:04.770
You can't love me one day and
piss on me the next. Yes, I can.

15:04.805 --> 15:06.570
How?
Listen.

15:06.605 --> 15:10.609
You got off on banging a chick who
was so happy to have a guy like you,

15:11.110 --> 15:14.363
she would do anything you
wanted-- in bed or in the kitchen.

15:14.398 --> 15:17.616
Bullshit! No. But you weren't
gonna get off on it forever.

15:17.651 --> 15:20.084
One day you were gonna
wake up and figure out...

15:20.119 --> 15:22.888
that you were tired of your
little side trip to Chubby Town.

15:22.923 --> 15:25.089
You're not in love, Mike.

15:25.124 --> 15:28.627
You're just pissed off because
I beat you to the punch.

15:28.662 --> 15:32.131
Hey, don't walk away from
me! Don't touch me, Mike.

15:32.166 --> 15:34.098
You love me.
No, not anymore.

15:34.133 --> 15:37.269
Hey, let go. Hey, pal, this
is more than you can handle.

15:37.304 --> 15:41.307
I'm warning you, shithead!

15:41.807 --> 15:44.560
What do you think you're doing?
Walt? Walt? Are you okay?

15:44.595 --> 15:47.313
- Get out of here!
- It wasn't supposed to go like this.

15:47.813 --> 15:50.482
You asshole!
You stupid asshole!

15:53.819 --> 15:57.072
Laura, are you sure you don't want
me to give you some money right now?

15:57.107 --> 16:00.326
I think it's better if I just give
you the grand total in the morning,

16:00.826 --> 16:02.328
assuming I'm done
drinking by then.

16:04.830 --> 16:07.333
I can't wait to see
the look on your face.

16:07.833 --> 16:10.301
You know, I do have a great
bottle of vodka in the freezer.

16:10.336 --> 16:12.838
I could crack it open, and we could
have a party of our own right now.

16:12.873 --> 16:15.841
You never give up, Franco.
I admire that.

16:15.876 --> 16:18.861
Yeah, well,
what do you say?

16:18.896 --> 16:21.812
I say do yourself
a favor...

16:21.847 --> 16:24.850
and stop by an A.T.M. on
the way to work tomorrow.

16:25.351 --> 16:28.854
You're gonna need it.

16:28.889 --> 16:30.856
Great.

16:45.871 --> 16:48.839
Hey.
Welcome to Park Avenue.

16:48.874 --> 16:51.377
Come on in, Son.
Give your old man a hug.

16:51.412 --> 16:54.898
What's goin' on?
Wow. Who's this?

16:54.933 --> 16:58.384
Uh, I don't know
which one this is.

16:58.419 --> 17:00.386
What do you mean,
which one?

17:00.421 --> 17:02.388
Well, look over here.

17:05.089 --> 17:07.059
Your stepmother knows
each one by name. My what?

17:07.559 --> 17:10.811
Your stepmother. Oh, I
forgot. I got married.

17:10.847 --> 17:13.707
Jesus Christ, Dad.
Who'd you get married to?

17:13.742 --> 17:16.823
- That girl I met in Ireland.
- An Irish girl?

17:16.858 --> 17:19.869
- No, Korean.
- What was she doing in Ireland?

17:19.905 --> 17:23.242
What else? Drinking. You know
how the Orientals love to drink.

17:23.277 --> 17:25.209
What was that?
Shit.

17:25.243 --> 17:27.211
Maybe you should leave.
What?

17:27.246 --> 17:31.750
Nothing, sweetheart. How many times
do I tell you? Not Oriental-- Asian.

17:31.785 --> 17:34.253
Why you such an asshole?

17:34.753 --> 17:37.721
Jeffrey!

17:37.756 --> 17:40.592
Tommy, this is my wife,
Jenny "Nig."

17:40.826 --> 17:42.361
Hi.
Ng! Ng!

17:42.628 --> 17:45.931
How many times I tell you?
Stupid, fat white man.

17:46.165 --> 17:49.566
I know you're a fireman.

17:49.601 --> 17:52.571
- Yes.
- You don't like cats?

17:52.606 --> 17:55.506
I'm just, uh,
more of a dog guy.

17:55.541 --> 18:00.112
In Korea, in my village,
I'm a little girl, we eat dog.

18:00.147 --> 18:03.449
Huh. Really?
You don't eat cats over there?

18:03.484 --> 18:06.118
The dogs have already
eaten the cats.

18:06.485 --> 18:10.055
- Ah.
- Five minutes, fat man.

18:10.322 --> 18:11.790
Okay?

18:14.793 --> 18:18.297
Life is short, Tommy.
Must stay on schedule.

18:19.798 --> 18:23.267
Do you need anything?
Drinks?

18:23.302 --> 18:25.102
You want a blast?
No, no. I'm fine.

18:25.137 --> 18:28.140
I'll have a double
kamikaze on the rocks.

18:28.640 --> 18:32.144
No, no, wait, wait. Make
that a triple. A triple?

18:32.644 --> 18:35.946
Well, I'm trying to play
catch-up here. What do you think?

18:35.981 --> 18:39.818
I think you should take a live goddamn
grenade and stick it up your fat Irish ass.

18:40.319 --> 18:42.286
What?
Keep it down.

18:42.321 --> 18:45.657
She's insane, Dad. Okay, so she
isn't what everybody expected.

18:45.692 --> 18:47.993
She's outside the box.
Yeah.

18:48.494 --> 18:52.381
And the fights
are just incredible.

18:52.416 --> 18:56.233
I must say the, uh--
the make-up sex--

18:56.268 --> 19:01.173
Well, let's just say I have
an oxygen tank next to the bed.

19:01.208 --> 19:04.009
Yeah. That's the end
of this particular chapter.

19:04.044 --> 19:07.012
No, no. Oh, Tommy, Tommy.
Come on. Come on.

19:07.047 --> 19:09.813
Get me caught up here.

19:09.848 --> 19:13.018
How's, uh-- How's Janet
and the kids?

19:13.053 --> 19:16.188
And-- And-- And, uh--
How's Teddy doing?

19:16.555 --> 19:18.690
Huh? How's Sheila?

19:19.191 --> 19:21.193
You better go get
that oxygen tank.

19:25.531 --> 19:27.533
Who is it?

19:27.568 --> 19:29.535
It's Laura.

19:32.871 --> 19:35.172
I forgot my bag.

19:35.207 --> 19:39.545
Yeah, I know. I realized like two
seconds after you walked out the door.

19:40.045 --> 19:42.513
Oh, thanks.

19:42.548 --> 19:44.550
So, you still hanging out
with your friends?

19:44.585 --> 19:47.518
Yeah, we're having
a good old time.

19:47.553 --> 19:51.890
Boy, girl, boy, girl, me.
I'm sorry to hear that.

19:52.124 --> 19:55.494
Yeah, well--

20:00.732 --> 20:05.702
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Are you sure you wanna do this?

20:05.737 --> 20:10.242
You've been hitting on me for four
months, and now you wanna talk about this?

20:10.742 --> 20:12.244
Come on.

20:14.246 --> 20:16.547
Are you sure about Teddy?

20:16.582 --> 20:21.420
Yeah. Johnny checked into it.
He's pretty certain, so--

20:21.787 --> 20:24.221
Dumb son of a bitch.
Yeah.

20:24.256 --> 20:26.641
I'm sorry about your kids, Tom. Yeah.

20:26.676 --> 20:29.136
It must be tearing your guts out. Yeah.

20:29.171 --> 20:31.597
What the hell is this shit? Huh? What?

20:31.830 --> 20:34.866
You're living with 30 cats,
banging some Chink broad.

20:35.167 --> 20:37.302
Hey, watch your language.
She listens to everything.

20:37.337 --> 20:39.403
Hey, first time I heard
the word "Chink" was from you...

20:39.438 --> 20:42.774
when John Lennon was on theMerv
Griffin Show with Yoko goddamn Ono.

20:42.809 --> 20:46.111
Well, she broke up the Beatles,
for Chrissakes. I liked those guys.

20:46.146 --> 20:49.615
What can I say?
I've been enlightened.

20:49.650 --> 20:51.582
Oh, really?
Yeah.

20:51.617 --> 20:54.553
I guess a couple million bucks
will do that to a working-class guy.

20:55.053 --> 20:57.723
It's not about the money, Tom.
What's it about? Enlighten me.

20:58.190 --> 21:01.059
Well, it's about the sex.

21:01.326 --> 21:03.562
Oh, Christ.
For Chrissakes, um--

21:03.597 --> 21:05.762
My cock still functions,

21:05.797 --> 21:08.300
and this broad
thinks I'm funny,

21:08.800 --> 21:12.304
and I get to bang her
for free.

21:12.671 --> 21:14.605
Come on, fat white man.

21:14.640 --> 21:17.441
Ah, look at that.
Isn't she a vision?

21:17.476 --> 21:22.314
Oh, if you ever have
the need to talk, I'm here.

21:22.349 --> 21:24.781
Until the 15th.

21:24.816 --> 21:27.784
And then
we'll be in Tahoe.

21:27.819 --> 21:30.322
And after that,
we'll be in Paris.

21:30.357 --> 21:32.389
Paris, France?

21:32.424 --> 21:34.660
It sure as shit
ain't Paris, Texas, asshole.

21:44.936 --> 21:48.440
Can I just say I'm having
a really good time?

21:48.475 --> 21:51.410
All right.
So what does this mean?

21:51.445 --> 21:54.413
This meaning... this?

21:54.448 --> 21:57.347
Yeah. What does it mean?

21:57.382 --> 22:01.753
Oh, come on. You did not
just ask me that.

22:01.788 --> 22:04.154
I thought
I was the girl here.

22:04.189 --> 22:07.159
Hey, don't flatter yourself,
okay? I just want to be clear.

22:07.194 --> 22:10.529
We work together. I don't
want things getting messy.

22:10.564 --> 22:13.497
Okay, let me
do the math for you.

22:13.532 --> 22:17.836
Drunk and horny meets
perpetually horny. Yeah.

22:17.871 --> 22:20.771
Equals, um,

22:20.806 --> 22:25.711
34 minutes
of extremely hot...

22:25.746 --> 22:28.679
but meaningless sex.

22:28.714 --> 22:31.967
So do you want
to discuss this some more,

22:32.002 --> 22:35.220
or, uh, do you wanna go
for the whole hour?

22:35.255 --> 22:38.724
Talking is way overrated.

22:38.759 --> 22:40.726
Oh, sorry.

22:42.227 --> 22:45.195
Yeah.

22:45.230 --> 22:47.232
I'm sorry.
Yeah?

22:47.733 --> 22:50.736
I feel bad that I yelled at you
and that retarded kid this morning.

22:50.771 --> 22:53.739
I don't know. I think it's
just the hormones from the baby.

22:53.774 --> 22:56.575
Um, can we have lunch?

22:56.942 --> 22:58.875
No.

22:58.910 --> 23:01.663
Can we have dinner?
No.

23:01.698 --> 23:04.416
Why not?
I got to, uh--

23:04.916 --> 23:07.384
I got to get
to a meeting.

23:07.419 --> 23:12.924
How about I cook a big, nice turkey
dinner for you on Wednesday night?

23:12.959 --> 23:15.427
Yeah, yeah.
That's great. I gotta go.

23:23.935 --> 23:25.937
Hi, Sully.
Seano.

23:26.438 --> 23:27.939
What? You got
a double shift?

23:28.440 --> 23:31.443
Not me. I'm out tonight.
Got a doctor's appointment.

23:31.943 --> 23:35.446
Yeah, your doctor works nights?
Yeah, he's great. Holistic.

23:35.481 --> 23:38.950
Yeah, what's that? Like there's
something wrong with your hole?

23:40.786 --> 23:45.589
No, holistic means
natural, alternative.

23:45.624 --> 23:49.044
Oh. Oh, that's cool. Hey, I don't know
what I did. I slept wrong or something.

23:49.079 --> 23:52.464
My back is killing me. Think you could
give me one of your rubs real quick?

23:52.499 --> 23:54.984
Yeah, no problem. Yeah, sure. Yeah?

23:55.019 --> 23:57.745
Thanks, man.
Take your shirt off.

23:57.780 --> 24:00.472
Yeah?
Yeah, it's just easier.

24:00.507 --> 24:02.474
All right.

24:11.483 --> 24:14.451
Oh, God, yeah.
Jesus. That's it.

24:14.486 --> 24:17.454
Ah, you're saving
my life, Sully, really.

24:17.489 --> 24:20.957
If you were a chick,
I'd marry you.

24:20.992 --> 24:23.995
Could you, uh-- A little
lower would be great. Yeah.

24:24.030 --> 24:26.181
Breathe.

24:26.216 --> 24:28.333
Breathe.

24:44.115 --> 24:47.317
What? I thought you didn't
want to show up here together.

24:47.352 --> 24:50.821
That's not what I said, and we're
not showing up here together.

24:50.856 --> 24:54.192
We're arriving at the same time from
two totally different starting points.

24:54.227 --> 24:58.530
Totally not the same thing.
I had fun last night.

24:58.565 --> 25:00.997
Yeah? Cool. Me too.

25:01.032 --> 25:03.500
You know, I thought you'd wake up
this morning all freaked out, like,

25:03.535 --> 25:06.538
"I was drunk. I can't believe I did
that. How can you take advantage of me?"

25:06.573 --> 25:11.543
You know, the usual. Well, I
still can't believe I did it,

25:11.578 --> 25:13.812
but I wasn't that drunk.

25:14.079 --> 25:17.883
You're not gonna mention this
to anyone, are you?

25:17.918 --> 25:20.886
No, I already did.
I'm just kidding.

25:20.921 --> 25:23.889
I wasn't planning to.
Good boy.

25:25.891 --> 25:27.858
Franco, right?
Yeah.

25:27.893 --> 25:29.860
Johnny Gavin, Tommy's brother.
Hey, man, how you doin'?

25:29.895 --> 25:32.898
Good. How you doin'? Good. Good. You
know, he doesn't work here anymore.

25:32.933 --> 25:34.900
He's over at-- Staten
Island. Yeah. No, I know.

25:34.935 --> 25:37.235
I'm lookin' for
somebody else. Thanks.

25:39.070 --> 25:41.406
A restraining order?
I don't understand.

25:41.773 --> 25:43.707
Let me spell it out
for you, Mike.

25:43.742 --> 25:46.995
You stalked your ex-girlfriend. You
knocked her down on the sidewalk.

25:47.030 --> 25:50.248
I didn't knock her down. Let me
finish. You laid her new boyfriend out.

25:50.649 --> 25:53.285
This is unacceptable
behavior. You got that?

25:53.320 --> 25:55.921
This is crazy. I'll talk
to her and clear it up.

25:56.421 --> 25:58.256
Dipshit, you're
not listening to me!

25:58.757 --> 26:00.724
I didn't have to come
down here and talk to you.

26:00.759 --> 26:04.763
I saw your name on the form. I
thought I would do you a solid.

26:04.798 --> 26:09.267
Mike, this chick wants you gone.
Be smart. Get gone.

26:14.606 --> 26:16.573
Good night.

26:16.608 --> 26:18.610
See you guys later.

26:18.645 --> 26:20.879
Hey.
Hey.

26:20.914 --> 26:23.399
Got your call.

26:23.434 --> 26:25.884
Yeah.
Guys busy?

26:26.151 --> 26:28.620
You really
let me down, Tommy.

26:28.655 --> 26:31.588
You really did.

26:31.623 --> 26:34.960
When I came in as a probie,
you were the goddamn man.

26:35.460 --> 26:37.427
Yeah. I looked at you
and I thought to myself,

26:37.462 --> 26:41.967
"If I can do the job like Tommy
Gavin, won't I just be king shit?"

26:43.802 --> 26:47.639
I never told you this, Tommy,
but the day I made my first grab,

26:47.674 --> 26:50.475
we were in the truck
on the way back after,

26:50.510 --> 26:52.995
and, uh, you just
kinda looked at me,

26:53.030 --> 26:55.256
you nodded and said,
"Good job, kid."

26:55.291 --> 26:58.388
I was flying on that
for, like, two days.

26:58.423 --> 27:01.486
Yeah, you put me in
for my first medal.

27:01.521 --> 27:04.823
Shit, Tommy.
You were my hero.

27:06.324 --> 27:08.993
Yeah, well, you know--
Forget that.

27:09.028 --> 27:11.628
I was trying to be
your friend, Tom.

27:11.663 --> 27:15.500
I knew you were drinking.
I knew you weren't yourself.

27:16.001 --> 27:20.505
I tried to pull you back, throw you a
few red flags without busting your balls.

27:21.940 --> 27:23.907
I was lookin' out
for you, bro.

27:23.942 --> 27:27.779
And then I'm the one that gets
hurt? I mean, how is that fair?

27:30.515 --> 27:32.517
I didn't say it was fair.

27:35.020 --> 27:41.026
You know, if I could go back in
time and fix everything, I would.

27:41.061 --> 27:43.528
But I can't.

27:47.465 --> 27:51.469
So, uh, how's your scar?

27:52.470 --> 27:55.974
Healing up.

27:56.474 --> 27:59.943
Pretty cool.
Yeah.

27:59.978 --> 28:01.444
Must be getting
a lot of tail with that.

28:01.479 --> 28:04.983
Yeah. Tell you the truth, I was kind
of embarrassed about it for a while.

28:05.018 --> 28:07.485
Thought it made me look scary.
Now I wish it was bigger.

28:07.520 --> 28:09.953
Yeah. What do you tell 'em?
It depends.

28:09.988 --> 28:13.992
Most of the time, I tell 'em I got it
pulling some kids out of a burning school.

28:14.027 --> 28:16.192
Depends on the chick.

28:16.227 --> 28:19.696
Yeah. Remember this one?
Oh, yeah.

28:19.731 --> 28:22.567
Yeah. You know what
I tell chicks about this?

28:22.602 --> 28:24.868
What?
Tell 'em I got it...

28:24.903 --> 28:27.906
saving an old blind lady's cat
in a huge apartment fire.

28:27.941 --> 28:30.373
Never fails.

28:30.408 --> 28:32.876
How'd you really get it?

28:32.911 --> 28:37.415
I was fighting one of my brothers in front
of a glass window. Went straight through.

28:37.916 --> 28:40.418
Hey, I like that. I think I'm gonna
make the kids in my story blind.

28:40.453 --> 28:42.385
Oh, yeah. Yeah, blind's good. Good.

28:42.420 --> 28:45.924
Blind works. Look,
I just wanted to say...

28:46.424 --> 28:48.426
that I'm... sorry.

28:48.927 --> 28:51.394
Oh, yeah.

28:51.429 --> 28:53.932
Yeah, we'll, uh,
talk some more.

28:54.432 --> 28:56.399
Yeah. Hang out. Whatever.

28:56.434 --> 28:58.937
All right, man. Stay safe. Yeah, always.

29:06.277 --> 29:09.579
Two in 62.
62 and respondent.

29:09.614 --> 29:12.117
Let's bring in the second
company down from 11th Avenue.

29:12.152 --> 29:16.121
At the box,
616 West 47th Street.

29:16.488 --> 29:19.422
And transmit a 1075
at the box.

29:19.457 --> 29:22.794
Have Rescue respond as well. We might
as well have SOC come in on this too.

29:23.294 --> 29:25.296
What's the good news?
We got a basement fire.

29:25.331 --> 29:27.263
Ah, perfect.
My day's complete.

29:27.298 --> 29:29.550
Probie, roll with me. We'll
check the back. You got it.

29:29.585 --> 29:31.803
We got a report of a few
people bein' trapped down there.

29:32.303 --> 29:34.139
Lou, you take Garrity and the
girl and go to the basement.

29:34.639 --> 29:37.107
Sean, force that door. You're
gonna need that safety rope.

29:37.142 --> 29:41.146
Italian 1-5, have the second two companies
respond to the rear of the building.

29:43.648 --> 29:46.151
Kinda wish you went
to college, huh, Garrity?

29:46.651 --> 29:49.154
I got lots of rope.

29:50.655 --> 29:53.123
Stay close.

29:53.158 --> 29:55.660
Garrity.

30:07.005 --> 30:10.008
Ah, shit. Garrity!

30:10.043 --> 30:12.010
Get her up!

30:27.358 --> 30:29.194
Oh, Jesus Christ!

30:30.528 --> 30:35.031
Laura! Laura!

30:35.066 --> 30:38.970
Miles! Goddamn it!

30:40.972 --> 30:44.475
Chief, I need some
bolt cutters down here.

30:44.510 --> 30:46.878
I got some freak
all chained up here.

30:47.378 --> 30:49.881
On the way.
And I lost Miles.

30:49.916 --> 30:53.885
Miles! Laura!

31:04.329 --> 31:06.130
Breathe, you freak.

31:07.398 --> 31:09.901
Last one down there.

31:18.910 --> 31:21.162
Did I or did I not
tell you to stay close?

31:21.197 --> 31:23.379
I thought you wanted me
to help Garrity.

31:23.414 --> 31:25.917
Who the hell trained you? It sure
as shit wasn't this department.

31:25.952 --> 31:28.937
You never, ever leave a member
of this crew alone in a fire.

31:28.972 --> 31:31.888
And the next time you do, I'm
having you brought up on charges.

31:31.923 --> 31:36.928
Get over there and help those guys
change the cylinders, you stupid twat.

31:39.430 --> 31:42.934
These young guys
crack me up these days.

31:43.434 --> 31:45.902
I mean, an underground sex
club. Yeah, no shit, Chief.

31:45.937 --> 31:48.439
Franco, this is New York City,
the greatest city in the world.

31:48.940 --> 31:50.441
I mean, you got
the Empire State Building,

31:50.942 --> 31:52.909
Statue of Liberty, Central Park,
theIntrepidright over here.

31:52.944 --> 31:56.447
Everything you'd wanna see, but, no,
they wanna go into some dingy basement...

31:56.482 --> 31:58.414
and hang from the ceiling
in a sling...

31:58.449 --> 32:01.953
with a rubber ball stuck in their
mouth and a rope tied around their nuts.

32:01.988 --> 32:04.473
I don't get it. Yeah, well,
on the other hand, Chief,

32:04.508 --> 32:06.958
how many times can you
go visit the Statue of Liberty?

32:07.458 --> 32:09.425
- Well, you got me there.
- Where's my grab?

32:09.460 --> 32:12.964
The woman you dragged out? I'm not
so sure that was a woman, Chief.

32:12.999 --> 32:15.466
What? Yeah. Probie and
Garrity got her over here.

32:20.972 --> 32:23.724
- She okay?
- A little hairy but breathing.

32:23.759 --> 32:26.442
Nice. Takes me right back
to the junior prom.

32:26.477 --> 32:29.981
Get some of that shit off her face and get
her head up so we can get some air down.

32:30.016 --> 32:32.448
Up you go.

32:32.483 --> 32:35.486
All the angels and saints!
Holy shit!

32:35.521 --> 32:39.991
Is that Sully?

32:40.491 --> 32:44.495
Blessed screaming Jesus on a
whole wheat goddamn cracker!

32:44.530 --> 32:46.462
Okay, I think
I'm gonna puke.

32:46.497 --> 32:51.467
Wait a minute.
Guys, let me explain.

32:51.502 --> 32:54.505
Oh, go ahead, pal.
We're-- We're all ears.

32:54.540 --> 32:58.509
I, uh-- Well, I wa--

33:02.513 --> 33:04.981
Who am I kidding, right?

33:05.016 --> 33:07.984
I like to dress up
like a chick, okay?

33:08.019 --> 33:12.523
I like to wear panties
and high heels and rough sex.

33:13.024 --> 33:15.026
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

33:15.526 --> 33:17.994
I told him I wanted
to marry him, okay?

33:18.029 --> 33:21.532
I'm suin' you. I'm suin' you.
I'm suin'-- Can I sue you?

33:21.567 --> 33:23.534
No, you can't. I'm
suin' all these people.

33:23.569 --> 33:25.536
I gotta go.
Franco, I'm suin' you.

33:25.571 --> 33:27.503
Guys?
Shut up.

33:27.538 --> 33:29.540
I'm gonna sue you.

33:29.575 --> 33:31.542
Sorry.

33:36.381 --> 33:39.384
Tommy.
Tommy.

33:39.751 --> 33:43.654
Tommy.
Tommy.

33:45.323 --> 33:48.059
What? Are you kidding?
Tommy.

33:48.292 --> 33:51.294
Hmm.
I'll go tell Perrolli.

33:51.329 --> 33:55.333
I've seen some pretty
horrific shit in my day, boys.

33:55.368 --> 33:57.668
People, kids,
burned beyond recognition.

33:57.935 --> 33:59.404
Faces melted.

33:59.904 --> 34:03.873
All erased by the image
of Sully in a skirt and a bra.

34:03.908 --> 34:06.911
Took me almost an hour and a
half to get to sleep last night.

34:09.246 --> 34:12.250
Yeah, I knew something was wrong when
you guys were saying that was a woman.

34:12.284 --> 34:14.770
There's no woman
that size in the world.

34:14.804 --> 34:17.255
Not counting
your girlfriend, probie.

34:17.290 --> 34:19.222
Asshole.

34:19.257 --> 34:22.260
Yo, man, you need a hug.
I was joking, probie.

34:22.295 --> 34:24.060
It was a joke.

34:24.094 --> 34:28.433
I thought that was funny.
It was funny, right, Sean?

34:28.467 --> 34:32.437
What-- He massaged me,
Frank. Twice, okay?

34:32.472 --> 34:34.904
A-And I liked it.

34:34.938 --> 34:37.907
Yeah, thanks for gettin' me involved
in that too. I appreciate it.

34:37.942 --> 34:42.196
I mean, if Sully is gay, and I liked
when he touched me, what does that mean?

34:42.231 --> 34:46.451
Well, first of all, not every guy that
dresses up in a wig and a bra is gay.

34:46.485 --> 34:48.684
Really?
Well, no, he's gay.

34:48.719 --> 34:53.458
Oh, Jesus. I just-- I mean, the way that he
touched me, it actually felt good, you know?

34:53.493 --> 34:55.960
And I just-- Now I feel like
I'm gonna puke. I just feel--

34:55.995 --> 34:58.463
Violated. Yes. I feel
like he touched me--

34:58.498 --> 35:00.430
Under false pretenses.
Yes. Yes.

35:00.465 --> 35:03.968
I was in the shower last night for two
hours, trying to wash the Sully off me.

35:04.003 --> 35:07.472
Sick bastard.
I just-- I feel bad.

35:07.972 --> 35:12.477
Hey, life's not always easy for
the little deer in the meadow.

35:12.512 --> 35:15.480
And it's never
the victim's fault, okay?

35:27.992 --> 35:31.746
You're tellin' me Gavin got
the vote? It was unanimous.

35:31.781 --> 35:35.500
Wonders never cease. So happens
we got a spot for him.

35:35.535 --> 35:37.967
I just signed
Mr. Sullivan's transfer out.

35:38.002 --> 35:41.005
I don't know what you boys did to him,
but he called first thing this morning...

35:41.405 --> 35:43.306
saying there's no way
he's ever coming back here.

35:43.341 --> 35:47.511
I don't know. The only thing we
ever did was save him in a fire.

35:47.546 --> 35:51.682
- I'll bet.
- I'm gonna go call Tommy and tell him the good news.

35:52.049 --> 35:55.035
Tell him not to expect
a warm welcome from yours truly.

35:55.070 --> 35:58.022
I have to call Sully.
Anything you want to tell him?

35:58.057 --> 36:00.525
Lighter on the mascara.

36:05.630 --> 36:07.882
Hey, Ma, I need
that gun I gave you.

36:07.917 --> 36:10.099
I thought you wanted me
to be safe.

36:10.134 --> 36:13.254
I read this story in the paper
about this lady your age...

36:13.289 --> 36:16.583
who had a gun, and she thought
she heard someone break in,

36:16.618 --> 36:19.877
and she grabbed the gun, and
she shot herself in the face.

36:19.912 --> 36:22.380
Since when
do you read the paper?

36:22.415 --> 36:24.382
Just get me the gun, Mom.

36:28.386 --> 36:30.388
Whoa! Guys, I gotta get going.

36:30.423 --> 36:32.355
Back to bein'
a real firefighter.

36:32.390 --> 36:35.191
You don't wanna wait for the
rest of the guys and the chief?

36:35.226 --> 36:38.062
I can't. I gotta deal with traffic on
the bridge. Nice working with you, Tommy.

36:38.097 --> 36:40.898
That's the problem, kid. You
never really got to see me work.

36:40.933 --> 36:42.900
Take it easy, guys.

36:44.402 --> 36:48.406
You're an asshole, Tommy. You're
a big asshole. I used to like you.

36:48.441 --> 36:51.374
Paulie, look. They're
gonna hire another guy.

36:51.409 --> 36:53.911
Maybe you'll like him better
than you like me. You never know.

36:54.412 --> 36:56.914
I got you another F.D.N.Y.
shirt. I don't want your shirt.

36:57.415 --> 37:00.216
I have shirts.
I want to go with you.

37:00.251 --> 37:03.754
All right, do me a favor.
Okay? Behave, all right?

37:04.255 --> 37:06.757
Promise me
you'll be good?

37:06.792 --> 37:08.759
Jesus.

37:13.764 --> 37:17.602
Excuse me. Do you have any turkeys
that are smaller than these?

37:18.102 --> 37:20.104
- These are huge.
- That's everything we got.

37:20.338 --> 37:21.872
All right.

37:27.278 --> 37:29.579
You need a hand there?

37:29.614 --> 37:32.783
Yeah. I guess I'm not
as strong as I think I am.

37:32.818 --> 37:34.785
That one.

37:44.462 --> 37:46.464
I need to talk to you.

37:46.499 --> 37:49.432
Okay.

37:49.467 --> 37:53.904
I realize I'm not even close to what
you consider a real firefighter to be.

37:53.939 --> 37:56.307
You made that perfectly
clear the other night.

37:56.741 --> 37:59.744
But that does not give you the
right to say what you said to me.

38:00.244 --> 38:03.114
I-- I don't think
I remember.

38:03.149 --> 38:05.047
You remember.

38:05.082 --> 38:07.885
No, I, uh--
I honestly don't.

38:07.920 --> 38:10.219
You called me a twat.

38:10.254 --> 38:14.592
No. No, no, no.
I called you a stupid twat.

38:14.627 --> 38:17.528
Yeah, it's all
coming back to me now.

38:17.563 --> 38:20.396
Apologize.
Excuse me?

38:20.431 --> 38:25.436
I'm sorry that I screwed up by helping
Sean in the fire the other night,

38:25.471 --> 38:28.973
but there's no goddamn way
you're gonna talk to me like that.

38:29.008 --> 38:31.676
I want an apology.

38:38.182 --> 38:40.149
I don't think so, honey.

38:40.184 --> 38:45.022
You call me honey one more time, and I'm gonna
kick your nuts through the top of your head.

38:45.057 --> 38:48.893
You remember that I outrank
you. Just a reminder.

38:50.861 --> 38:52.863
I don't want to make
a big deal out of this.

38:53.364 --> 38:55.366
You apologize.
Issue's dead.

39:10.047 --> 39:13.217
Do you have a bathroom?
Employees only.

39:16.220 --> 39:19.724
I don't think I'm gonna make it
home. Do you think they could maybe--

39:21.759 --> 39:24.026
Are you okay?

39:24.061 --> 39:27.029
I think I just need
to use the bathroom.

39:27.064 --> 39:30.568
Oh, God. You're-- You're--
Honey, you're bleeding.

39:30.603 --> 39:33.035
I just need to use
the bathroom!

39:33.070 --> 39:36.574
She's bleeding. Call
someone. Larry, come here!

39:36.609 --> 39:39.844
Oh, my Go-- Larry!

39:41.579 --> 39:44.547
Guys, huh?
Like a bad penny.

39:44.582 --> 39:47.334
Hey, ain't that the
truth? Hi. How are ya?

39:47.369 --> 39:50.052
Welcome back.
There goes the neighborhood.

39:50.087 --> 39:53.090
It's good to see you.
Hey, the probie still here?

39:53.125 --> 39:55.092
Yeah. I thought he'd be dead by now.

39:55.593 --> 39:59.096
What's going on? What's eating
him? Oh, that time of the month.

39:59.131 --> 40:03.100
Yeah? Speaking of which--
Hey, Frankie. Where's Laura?

40:03.135 --> 40:05.102
Who gives a shit?

40:05.603 --> 40:08.606
Hey, I bet you wanna give me
a nice, big, wet kiss, right?

40:08.641 --> 40:11.108
Right here, Gavin.
Right here.

40:11.609 --> 40:14.076
All right. Douche bag. Yeah.

40:14.111 --> 40:16.614
Hey, listen. Put your stuff away.
We'll go inside. We'll shoot the shit.

40:16.649 --> 40:18.616
Great. Yeah, yeah.
Did you hear about Sully?

40:19.116 --> 40:21.452
Oh, yeah. Congratulations.
When's the wedding again?

40:21.487 --> 40:23.788
That's not what
I was taking about.

40:24.288 --> 40:27.291
You should wear pads
for the next few days.

40:27.525 --> 40:30.025
Most of the matter's been
expelled from your uterus,

40:30.060 --> 40:35.566
but it usually takes about 72 hours
for everything to work its way out.

40:39.069 --> 40:41.822
Can-- Can I get
pregnant again?

40:41.857 --> 40:44.217
I wouldn't try again
anytime soon.

40:44.252 --> 40:46.542
Do you want us
to call someone?

40:46.577 --> 40:50.581
No. No, I don't want you
to call anyone.

40:52.583 --> 40:55.836
You're free to stay
and rest if you want.

40:55.871 --> 40:59.089
Mm-mmm. I have someone
coming for dinner.

41:34.358 --> 41:36.360
Mmm. So we narrowed
the names down.

41:36.395 --> 41:38.362
Yeah? To what?

41:38.863 --> 41:42.366
Jimmy if it's a boy, and Jamie if
it's a girl. I like both of those.

41:42.401 --> 41:45.369
Let's not talk about names.
It's supposed to be bad luck.

41:47.371 --> 41:51.375
I've really been lagging on finishing
that extra room for the baby.

41:51.410 --> 41:54.378
I'm gonna do that. I'll get
the guys to come over this week.

41:54.879 --> 41:57.381
Also we're gonna make
a handmade crib. Oh, no.

41:57.416 --> 41:59.383
Yeah.
We're not--

41:59.884 --> 42:02.351
Mmm. Can we put a doorway between
my room and the baby's room?

42:02.386 --> 42:07.892
So, you know, if the baby's crying
at night, I can hear it and help out.

42:07.927 --> 42:10.860
Yeah, what's the rush?

42:10.895 --> 42:14.899
It's right around the corner.
Every night on every street

42:14.934 --> 42:17.867
You okay?
Yes.

42:17.902 --> 42:21.906
You hardly touched your food.
Cocoa face, you're eating for--

42:21.941 --> 42:24.742
I know. I know.
I'm eating for two now.

42:27.745 --> 42:30.247
Uh, can you pass
the cranberries?

42:30.282 --> 42:33.250
'Cause I'll never

42:33.751 --> 42:38.255
Never sleep alone

42:40.257 --> 42:45.195
Look at how
they flock to him

42:45.462 --> 42:48.032
To an aisle of open sores ?

43:31.976 --> 43:32.910
Cloudland.
