00:01.119 --> 00:03.802
- Previously on The Resident...
- This new neurosurgeon,

00:03.803 --> 00:05.810
- Dr. Cain.
- Do you know how much he bills?

00:05.811 --> 00:06.878
$80 million a year.

00:06.879 --> 00:08.339
Dr. Voss bills $2 million.

00:08.340 --> 00:10.025
Stick with me, and
we will rise together.

00:10.026 --> 00:11.710
Sky's the limit for men like us.

00:11.711 --> 00:12.894
Looked up my birth parents.

00:12.895 --> 00:14.988
- Where are they now?
- Right here in Atlanta.

00:14.989 --> 00:17.699
Three grown-ass kids. The
ones they didn't give away.

00:17.700 --> 00:20.035
I want to start talking about moving in.

00:20.036 --> 00:21.828
Let me do this at my own pace.

00:21.829 --> 00:23.830
I just only have one request.

00:23.831 --> 00:25.240
I really want those chickens.

00:25.241 --> 00:27.334
No chickens.

00:29.000 --> 00:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:45.961 --> 00:47.576
Good morning.

00:47.577 --> 00:49.472
I'm Dr. Bell. We spoke on the phone.

00:49.473 --> 00:51.249
I thought you said
there would be cameras.

00:51.250 --> 00:52.642
There will be.

00:52.643 --> 00:55.754
But I'm-I'm just here today
to go over the surgery.

00:55.755 --> 00:57.072
Okay.

00:57.073 --> 00:58.982
Come on in.

00:58.983 --> 01:02.869
Dale, Reggie, we are so excited

01:02.870 --> 01:04.512
that you're entrusting Chastain

01:04.513 --> 01:07.014
with this life-changing
separation surgery.

01:07.015 --> 01:09.505
We've always been joined at the hip.

01:09.506 --> 01:11.699
Side by side every day of our lives.

01:11.700 --> 01:14.768
To be honest, the idea
of not having my brother

01:14.769 --> 01:16.904
right next to me is a little...

01:16.905 --> 01:18.072
scary.

01:18.073 --> 01:19.607
I don't know what it would be like

01:19.608 --> 01:21.075
- to sleep without this jerk
- ... this jerk

01:21.076 --> 01:22.101
- snoring in my ear.
- snoring in my ear.

01:22.102 --> 01:24.027
After surgery, you can decide

01:24.028 --> 01:25.797
how much togetherness you want.

01:25.798 --> 01:27.674
How dangerous is it?

01:27.675 --> 01:29.008
- For Reggie and Dale?
- June,

01:29.009 --> 01:30.677
he already said the risk is minor.

01:30.678 --> 01:32.295
This is true.

01:32.296 --> 01:33.805
Because the connection

01:33.806 --> 01:37.141
is relatively superficial.

01:40.146 --> 01:42.147
I love you.

01:42.148 --> 01:44.040
Reggie, Dale,

01:44.041 --> 01:46.642
the two of you are the loves of my life.

01:46.643 --> 01:49.285
And you are my everything.

01:49.286 --> 01:50.846
My whole heart.

01:50.847 --> 01:52.440
Boys, we can figure this all out

01:52.441 --> 01:54.108
after the surgery.

01:54.109 --> 01:56.277
You both can have your own girlfriend.

01:56.278 --> 01:57.887
Isn't that right, Dr. Bell?

01:57.888 --> 02:00.540
If that's what they want.

02:00.541 --> 02:03.042
You don't seem happy about this.

02:03.043 --> 02:05.527
We want to know what you really think.

02:05.528 --> 02:06.829
- Talk to us.
- Talk to us.

02:06.830 --> 02:09.789
If you two want this surgery,

02:09.791 --> 02:11.334
I'll be there for you.

02:11.335 --> 02:13.031
But to be totally honest,

02:13.032 --> 02:16.038
I think our love is like
a three-legged stool.

02:16.039 --> 02:20.134
Remove a leg, and I'm afraid
we're gonna tip right over.

02:20.135 --> 02:22.437
Uh, this is a bigger decision

02:22.438 --> 02:24.639
- than just one girl.
- Would you like to speak

02:24.640 --> 02:26.940
to some separated twins?

02:28.252 --> 02:29.977
No, thank you.

02:29.978 --> 02:33.072
We're sorry for wasting your
time, but the surgery is off.

02:33.073 --> 02:35.073
- Permanently.
- Permanently.

02:47.037 --> 02:49.755
What are you thinking about?

02:54.577 --> 02:58.263
I'm ready. 
Let's move in together.

03:00.809 --> 03:04.679
Mmm. Absolutely.

03:04.680 --> 03:07.139
Mmm, mmm, as soon as possible.

03:07.140 --> 03:08.566
Mwah.

03:08.567 --> 03:12.278
I just wish we could get
that house that you showed me

03:12.279 --> 03:13.887
when you first started talking about it.

03:13.888 --> 03:15.740
- It was so right for us.
- Mm, in this market,

03:15.741 --> 03:17.408
somebody probably already took it.

03:17.409 --> 03:20.403
- Yeah.
- But we both have great places now.

03:20.404 --> 03:23.239
I could move into yours or
you could move into mine.

03:23.240 --> 03:26.409
- Are those our only options?
- No, they're just the quickest.

03:28.945 --> 03:32.090
This place is rent-controlled.

03:32.091 --> 03:35.710
And I've clearly nailed
the urban chic look.

03:37.212 --> 03:38.954
It's just not very private.

03:38.955 --> 03:40.932
Mm, a short walk to work.

03:40.933 --> 03:42.992
Yeah. How's the ankle?

03:42.993 --> 03:45.219
I don't think you're gonna be
walking to work anytime soon.

03:45.220 --> 03:47.830
Is that your way of saying
we should live at your place?

03:47.831 --> 03:50.666
No, actually...

03:50.667 --> 03:53.945
After everything...

03:53.946 --> 03:57.340
- It's been a rough year.
- Yeah.

03:57.341 --> 04:00.476
I just think it might be
nice to have a fresh start.

04:00.477 --> 04:03.870
You know? Something
that's ours together.

04:06.166 --> 04:08.409
Boarding Flight 416...

04:08.410 --> 04:10.486
Now, Dawn, your doctor told you

04:10.487 --> 04:12.171
you have cancer of the appendix,

04:12.172 --> 04:14.490
which is a very rare,
aggressive form of cancer.

04:14.491 --> 04:17.010
So he basically said just
go home and give up hope.

04:17.011 --> 04:20.137
Yeah, he did. But I can't do that.

04:20.139 --> 04:22.631
I have seven beautiful kids.

04:22.632 --> 04:25.092
I want you all to take
a look at these pictures.

04:25.093 --> 04:28.304
- Take a look.
- Aw.

04:28.305 --> 04:30.973
Dawn is a single mom of seven kids

04:30.974 --> 04:33.509
that she adopted through
the foster care program.

04:33.510 --> 04:35.211
My kids need me.

04:35.212 --> 04:38.180
So, I did my research,

04:38.181 --> 04:40.123
and it turns out, there is something

04:40.124 --> 04:42.594
- that could buy me precious time.
- And what's that?

04:42.595 --> 04:45.946
They call it "the
Mother of All Surgeries."

04:45.947 --> 04:48.315
No doctor will do it.

04:48.316 --> 04:51.210
12 hospitals turned her down. 12.

04:51.211 --> 04:54.288
They say the odds are too long.

04:54.289 --> 04:56.899
But I am ready to fight, Montel.

04:56.900 --> 05:00.628
I just need a surgeon
brave enough to help me.

05:02.172 --> 05:04.673
Yeah, you can see we all
want this for you, Dawn.

05:04.674 --> 05:06.032
- Right?
- Yes.

05:06.033 --> 05:08.863
- We want this for your family.
- Thank you.

05:08.864 --> 05:12.431
And that's why today
you're gonna meet a surgeon

05:12.432 --> 05:16.218
who not only has the courage
but also has the skills

05:16.219 --> 05:17.862
to do the Mother of All Surgeries.

05:17.863 --> 05:20.041
Ladies and gentlemen, from
Chastain Memorial Hospital,

05:20.042 --> 05:22.909
please welcome Dr.
Barrett Cain to the show.

05:32.603 --> 05:36.506
Dawn, will you let me
fight this cancer with you?

05:37.740 --> 05:39.775
You're the answer to my prayers.

05:46.392 --> 05:50.561
Dr. Damn He's Hot can
operate on me any day.

05:52.456 --> 05:55.400
Mmm, mmm-mmm-mmm.

05:58.008 --> 06:06.008
- Synced and corrected by<font color="#00BFFF"> Firefly</font> -

06:12.442 --> 06:15.919
- What's this?
- Cool hundred if you make the next one in.

06:33.105 --> 06:34.772
Save it for Augusta.

06:34.773 --> 06:36.274
Yeah, that's where the big money is.

06:36.275 --> 06:38.943
Just hang onto it and
let me, uh, put it toward

06:38.944 --> 06:41.988
a healthier wager on a real course.

06:41.989 --> 06:44.282
I'm sure word must have
gotten to you by now

06:44.283 --> 06:47.009
that I've brought in the Mother
of All Surgeries to Chastain.

06:47.010 --> 06:50.938
Yeah, about that, um...

06:50.939 --> 06:53.958
typically the chief of surgery
decides whether to take on

06:53.959 --> 06:55.817
a high-risk, low-reward
surgery like that one.

06:55.818 --> 06:58.454
Typically, I'm not used to
having someone vet my choices.

06:58.455 --> 07:02.133
This one's newsworthy, it's splashy.

07:02.134 --> 07:05.511
This would be great
publicity for Chastain.

07:05.512 --> 07:08.464
Greater than separating conjoined twins.

07:08.465 --> 07:14.102
Not if Chastain turns those
seven adorable foster children

07:14.103 --> 07:16.180
- into orphans.
- I guarantee that will not happen.

07:16.181 --> 07:17.830
That is not a guarantee you should make.

07:17.831 --> 07:20.318
This surgery is hardly that simple.

07:20.319 --> 07:21.819
It's a brutal procedure.

07:21.820 --> 07:25.007
It's like ten abdominal
surgeries rolled into one.

07:25.008 --> 07:26.240
You're worrying too much.

07:26.241 --> 07:28.421
The cancer has already
infiltrated her spine.

07:28.422 --> 07:30.912
So, even if the cancer is in end-stage,

07:30.913 --> 07:33.706
the woman can die in a week,
even without the surgery.

07:33.707 --> 07:36.209
Now, on the off chance
she gains no more time...

07:36.210 --> 07:37.909
Or she dies on the table...

07:37.910 --> 07:40.788
We gave a mother and
her seven kids hope.

07:40.789 --> 07:43.948
We took a moon shot that
no other hospital would.

07:43.949 --> 07:47.512
So, regardless of the
outcome, we're heroes.

07:47.513 --> 07:49.538
Which is actually why
I came to see you today.

07:49.539 --> 07:53.509
I am assembling a team of the very best.

07:53.510 --> 07:56.394
Which means you, as my cocaptain...

07:57.714 --> 08:01.424
... we share in the
publicity and in the glory.

08:01.425 --> 08:03.143
- Or the blame.
- You know, Randolph,

08:03.144 --> 08:06.239
I actually took you for a gambling man.

08:06.240 --> 08:10.259
The PR payout on this is off the charts.

08:10.260 --> 08:12.319
What's the problem?

08:12.320 --> 08:14.538
Stakes too high for you?

08:18.237 --> 08:20.102
If we do this, we could be fired.

08:20.103 --> 08:21.771
If we don't, then I'm quitting.

08:21.772 --> 08:24.498
Is this the breaking and
entering stage of grief?

08:24.499 --> 08:25.941
Maybe.

08:25.942 --> 08:28.410
- You backing out?
- No.

08:28.411 --> 08:31.079
They say it's better to
ask for forgiveness...

08:31.080 --> 08:33.597
Than permission.

08:36.311 --> 08:38.604
Hey. Give me a shot of cortisone.

08:38.605 --> 08:41.807
What's wrong? Physical
therapy isn't helping?

08:41.808 --> 08:43.775
No, it's helping,
but it's just a long process.

08:43.777 --> 08:45.736
I need a little help
getting through today.

08:45.737 --> 08:47.963
Hmm. No.

08:47.964 --> 08:50.357
As in N-O, not a chance in hell.

08:50.358 --> 08:51.734
Pain is the body's warning system.

08:51.735 --> 08:53.235
Mask it and what happens?

08:53.236 --> 08:55.270
You can push yourself too
hard and hurt yourself again.

08:55.271 --> 08:58.499
But I'm a doctor, so I won't do that.

08:58.500 --> 09:01.969
Here's my answer:
acetaminophen, ice, elevation.

09:01.970 --> 09:04.839
Now, come on, I'll walk you
down to PT... ignore that.

09:06.875 --> 09:08.175
Sorry.

09:08.176 --> 09:10.343
I will find you, Conrad.

09:12.288 --> 09:14.640
I know where you work.

09:19.888 --> 09:23.495
- Traitor.
- It's a rotation in the oncology service.

09:23.496 --> 09:24.775
Everyone does rotations.

09:24.776 --> 09:27.111
Yeah, but it's breaking
my heart to think of you

09:27.112 --> 09:29.805
in anything but
eye-catching green scrubs.

09:29.806 --> 09:31.940
- Ow.
- ♪ Babe magnet. ♪

09:31.941 --> 09:35.010
He's leaving us to roll in chemo
cash. That is not attractive.

09:35.011 --> 09:37.163
It's, you know, it's, it's betrayal.

09:37.164 --> 09:38.772
Tumor biology has fascinated me

09:38.773 --> 09:40.741
since my publication in JAMA Oncology.

09:40.742 --> 09:42.281
- You know that.
- Yeah, yeah, well,

09:42.282 --> 09:43.535
try to remember us little people

09:43.536 --> 09:47.213
down here saving lives
without kickbacks from pharma.

09:58.201 --> 10:00.202
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

10:00.203 --> 10:03.296
I'm so glad you could make it for lunch.

10:03.297 --> 10:04.649
Adaku, it's been ages.

10:04.650 --> 10:06.642
The photos you've been
posting look amazing,

10:06.643 --> 10:09.344
but it's impossible to keep
track of where you've been.

10:09.345 --> 10:12.031
Kyoto, New Zealand, Norway.

10:12.032 --> 10:14.516
Okay, please don't tell me

10:14.517 --> 10:18.870
that this trip was some
sort of bucket list.

10:20.832 --> 10:23.559
I'm not dying.

10:23.560 --> 10:25.060
I've never felt more alive.

10:25.061 --> 10:26.395
I beat breast cancer.

10:26.396 --> 10:29.340
Thank goodness.

10:29.341 --> 10:34.135
I was on a... babymoon.

10:38.241 --> 10:39.641
I'm pregnant.

10:40.877 --> 10:43.395
Aren't you gonna say something?

10:45.190 --> 10:46.899
What do you want me to say?

10:46.900 --> 10:49.360
"I'm happy for you, Adaku.

10:49.361 --> 10:51.673
You've wanted to be a
mother your entire life"?

10:51.674 --> 10:53.757
- What did your oncologist say?
- "Congratulations"?

10:53.758 --> 10:54.982
This is not a joke, Adaku.

10:54.983 --> 10:56.725
Have you been following her advice?

10:56.726 --> 10:58.485
Completely.

10:58.486 --> 11:01.215
She told me to extract
eggs before chemo, so I did.

11:01.216 --> 11:02.952
She told me to wait until after chemo

11:02.953 --> 11:06.043
until we knew that I was
cancer-free to get pregnant.

11:06.044 --> 11:10.214
And you did all of this without
telling me? Your best friend?

11:10.215 --> 11:12.133
I didn't want to tell you,

11:12.134 --> 11:13.575
because I knew you'd say don't do it.

11:13.576 --> 11:16.077
Have my ovaries and
tubes removed. It's safer.

11:16.078 --> 11:18.806
BRCA1 mutation is definitely
linked to ovarian cancer.

11:18.807 --> 11:20.590
Is it so awful that I want you safe?

11:20.591 --> 11:22.545
I am safe. I am healthy.

11:22.546 --> 11:24.712
I am fit as a fiddle.

11:24.713 --> 11:26.564
They said you were free of breast cancer

11:26.565 --> 11:28.515
before you got pregnant, right?

11:28.516 --> 11:31.235
That was also before your
trip, so months ago now.

11:31.236 --> 11:33.963
I have a friend in oncology

11:33.964 --> 11:36.523
who can check to make sure
there's nothing worrisome

11:36.524 --> 11:38.242
on your ovaries either.

11:38.243 --> 11:40.736
Will you just go with
me for a quick test?

11:40.737 --> 11:44.081
To... put my troubled mind at ease?

11:44.082 --> 11:46.308
Yes, dear Mina,

11:46.309 --> 11:48.418
I can do that.

11:51.039 --> 11:53.240
Yes, yes, yes.

11:53.241 --> 11:55.542
We get this once a month.

11:55.543 --> 11:57.302
It's me and you, baby.

12:02.659 --> 12:05.219
Doughnut holes are my preference.

12:05.220 --> 12:06.929
Baker's dozen.

12:06.930 --> 12:08.709
Glazed, chocolate, jelly.

12:08.710 --> 12:09.940
Finish with the powder.

12:09.941 --> 12:10.941
I like to get my hands dirty

12:10.942 --> 12:12.943
in my work and my baked goods,

12:12.944 --> 12:15.838
but I do not dunk.

12:15.839 --> 12:17.272
That's me.

12:17.273 --> 12:19.107
Speaking of me, I am...

12:19.108 --> 12:21.643
I know who you are.

12:21.644 --> 12:23.829
There were photos of you
in the files e-mailed to me

12:23.830 --> 12:25.482
by the adoption agency.

12:25.483 --> 12:28.334
You are my egg donor's sperm donor.

12:28.335 --> 12:30.686
"Biological father" works just as well.

12:30.687 --> 12:32.688
Ah, the word "father" in any capacity

12:32.689 --> 12:35.190
is reserved for the man who raised me.

12:35.191 --> 12:37.176
Come on, dawg.

12:37.177 --> 12:39.930
I-I-In what world did ambushing
me like this make sense?

12:39.931 --> 12:41.363
I have my reasons.

12:41.364 --> 12:43.757
Now, you can either hear me out

12:43.758 --> 12:45.717
or do your damnedest to chase me off.

12:45.718 --> 12:46.897
Don't push my buttons,

12:46.898 --> 12:49.240
or I will push back and I
will decimate your buttons.

12:49.241 --> 12:50.839
You gonna play fair, I can take it.

12:50.840 --> 12:53.174
But you cross a line, I will defend

12:53.175 --> 12:56.653
with a tongue just as keen as yours.

13:01.368 --> 13:04.476
We are grown-ass men now.

13:05.855 --> 13:10.917
And I am here to talk to you
about grown-ass men things.

13:19.335 --> 13:21.128
Half your genes come from me,

13:21.129 --> 13:22.263
and I'm dying.

13:22.264 --> 13:24.014
Make an appointment.

13:24.015 --> 13:26.808
It's hereditary.

13:27.911 --> 13:31.813
Which means you might be dying, too.

13:37.919 --> 13:39.627
If you're experiencing immediate pain,

13:39.628 --> 13:41.061
come to the front.
Otherwise, take a seat

13:41.062 --> 13:42.462
and we'll be right with you.

13:45.003 --> 13:46.561
Everett Dobb.

13:46.562 --> 13:48.855
Executive director of
the transformation team.

13:48.856 --> 13:51.041
- Transformation team?
- I facilitate

13:51.042 --> 13:53.994
a smooth operational shift
between the old and new regimes,

13:53.995 --> 13:56.772
Chastain and Red Rock, by
managing the golden triangle

13:56.773 --> 13:58.151
of patient safety, access,

13:58.152 --> 14:00.886
- and cost.
- Well, that's a mouthful.

14:02.612 --> 14:04.871
We did a cost-benefit analysis
and closed this clinic.

14:04.872 --> 14:05.948
I'm not clear what you're doing here,

14:05.949 --> 14:07.638
- but you're trespassing.
- Well, Chastain

14:07.639 --> 14:09.894
has an obligation to provide
health care for those in need.

14:09.895 --> 14:12.287
We are a nonprofit
hospital and tax-exempt,

14:12.288 --> 14:13.622
so it's a legal requirement.

14:13.623 --> 14:14.940
An obligation we fulfill

14:14.941 --> 14:16.749
by treating the uninsured in our ER.

14:16.750 --> 14:18.927
I'm not sure it's considered
charity when you're turning them

14:18.928 --> 14:21.572
into collections and docking
paychecks when they can't pay.

14:21.573 --> 14:23.065
All of which is in alignment

14:23.066 --> 14:24.925
with our core value of
fiscal responsibility

14:24.926 --> 14:27.027
and... I might point
out... is totally legal.

14:27.028 --> 14:29.029
You, on the other hand, broke the law.

14:29.030 --> 14:31.106
I can have you arrested
for breaking and entering.

14:31.107 --> 14:32.583
If you close the clinic,

14:32.584 --> 14:34.835
Chastain could very well
lose its nonprofit status,

14:34.836 --> 14:36.995
ending the tax break
and saddling the hospital

14:36.996 --> 14:38.496
with a bill for millions of dollars.

14:38.497 --> 14:40.722
We won't be audited for two years.

14:40.723 --> 14:43.302
Empty this place and vacate now,

14:43.303 --> 14:44.928
or I will call the police.

14:51.554 --> 14:53.095
I know you already know this,

14:53.096 --> 14:55.850
but Dr. Grisham is going to
do a transvaginal ultrasound.

14:55.851 --> 14:58.108
It'll allow us to check
your reproductive organs

14:58.109 --> 14:59.158
for any signs of cancer.

14:59.159 --> 15:00.778
Remember, don't get
distracted by the fetus.

15:00.779 --> 15:03.304
Just make sure her ovaries look normal.

15:03.305 --> 15:05.888
I love her, but she's bossy.

15:05.889 --> 15:08.702
I love her because she's bossy.

15:08.703 --> 15:10.070
Never say that again.

15:10.071 --> 15:11.871
Okay, guys, we're ready to start.

15:11.872 --> 15:14.082
I'll be outside if you need me.

15:16.169 --> 15:18.453
Grisham's the best and always busy.

15:18.454 --> 15:20.397
- Thanks for getting us in.
- No worries.

15:20.398 --> 15:22.007
She's lucky to have you.

15:22.008 --> 15:24.492
But, Mina, don't scare her off too much.

15:24.493 --> 15:26.086
Let her enjoy being pregnant.

15:26.087 --> 15:28.639
I've watched too many women,
particularly women of color,

15:28.640 --> 15:30.716
be harmed because no one
was looking out for them.

15:30.717 --> 15:32.201
You know that as well as anyone.

15:32.202 --> 15:33.535
I hear you.

15:33.536 --> 15:35.336
But Adaku's getting great care,

15:35.337 --> 15:36.814
and she's done everything right.

15:36.815 --> 15:39.717
Her dream of becoming
a mother is coming true.

15:39.718 --> 15:42.569
Except the pregnancy hormones
might bring her cancer back

15:42.570 --> 15:45.572
or increase the risk of ovarian cancer.

15:45.573 --> 15:47.274
I'm afraid of losing her.

15:49.277 --> 15:50.911
I know.

15:50.912 --> 15:52.779
Triple negative breast cancer is scary.

15:52.780 --> 15:54.781
But we understand more
about it every day.

15:54.782 --> 15:56.725
And now we can analyze tumor DNA

15:56.726 --> 15:58.393
and know that Adaku is less likely

15:58.394 --> 16:00.062
to respond to pregnancy hormones.

16:00.063 --> 16:02.497
It won't increase her
risk of reoccurrence.

16:02.498 --> 16:05.342
Your fear is understandable

16:05.343 --> 16:07.219
but groundless.

16:07.220 --> 16:08.679
I promise.

16:11.453 --> 16:12.486
I got to go.

16:12.487 --> 16:13.745
Keep me posted, okay?

16:14.816 --> 16:16.407
Thank you.

16:18.161 --> 16:19.869
Lamar gave me full access

16:19.870 --> 16:21.442
to his medical file, and it indicates

16:21.443 --> 16:23.527
his emphysema's in early stages.

16:23.528 --> 16:25.887
So he's not dying?

16:25.888 --> 16:27.147
No.

16:27.148 --> 16:29.816
He does have the alpha-1
antitrypsin deficiency.

16:29.817 --> 16:32.369
Which can lead to end-stage
lung disease over time

16:32.370 --> 16:33.561
but nothing imminent.

16:33.562 --> 16:34.930
Exactly.

16:34.931 --> 16:37.875
So now I'm gonna draw some blood

16:37.876 --> 16:39.788
and see if you have
the deficiency as well.

16:39.789 --> 16:41.536
Why would he show up and lie like that?

16:41.537 --> 16:42.796
I don't know, to get the attention

16:42.797 --> 16:44.935
- of the child he gave away?
- Yeah, but why?

16:46.042 --> 16:48.719
I think there's more to
the story than you know.

16:48.720 --> 16:51.222
You think?

16:51.223 --> 16:53.081
Initial diagnosis.

16:54.642 --> 16:57.135
Biology's a huge bitch, man.

16:57.136 --> 16:59.513
I mean, Lamar rolls up on me

16:59.514 --> 17:01.456
with my walk, my talk.

17:01.457 --> 17:04.068
I never met the man, but
it's obvious we share DNA.

17:04.069 --> 17:06.569
Yeah, well, I struggled to
give my dad a second chance

17:06.570 --> 17:08.071
for a lot of reasons.

17:08.073 --> 17:10.074
But then, when I decided
to let him in a bit,

17:10.075 --> 17:11.800
I discovered some things,
some good things about him

17:11.800 --> 17:13.301
I wouldn't have known
if I'd just shut him out.

17:13.303 --> 17:15.804
Well, you and your dad were
estranged, but he raised you.

17:15.805 --> 17:17.498
You had a foundation.

17:17.499 --> 17:20.084
This man gave me away.

17:20.085 --> 17:23.044
He married my biological
mom, had three more kids,

17:23.045 --> 17:24.244
full siblings to me,

17:24.246 --> 17:26.307
and none of 'em cared to look me up.

17:27.782 --> 17:29.342
Until now.

17:34.582 --> 17:38.656
I am very excited to consult
on the Mother of All Surgeries.

17:38.657 --> 17:41.921
The cancer has spread from
her appendix to her colon,

17:41.922 --> 17:45.700
ovaries, gall bladder,
kidneys, and peritoneum.

17:45.701 --> 17:48.173
It's hard to believe it's even operable.

17:48.174 --> 17:50.096
- It isn't.
- One opinion.

17:50.097 --> 17:53.258
I'll remove any visible
tumor I see, meticulously,

17:53.259 --> 17:55.536
even if it means
taking the entire organ.

17:55.537 --> 17:57.663
Then the cavity will be filled

17:57.664 --> 17:59.456
with hot chemo; we'll bathe them.

17:59.457 --> 18:00.982
Scalding-hot chemo.

18:00.983 --> 18:04.224
- 107 degrees.
- Enough to burn or destroy

18:04.225 --> 18:06.748
any microscopic cells that remain.

18:06.749 --> 18:08.132
But still won't touch

18:08.133 --> 18:10.859
the lesion wrapped
around her spinal column,

18:10.860 --> 18:12.803
with a pathological fracture.

18:12.804 --> 18:15.983
Which is why you're an
essential part of the surgery.

18:15.984 --> 18:18.024
I'm assuming you'll be
taking the anterior approach

18:18.025 --> 18:20.427
- to the spinal lesions?
- I won't be doing a damn thing.

18:21.717 --> 18:24.505
The cancer is too widespread
and too aggressive.

18:24.506 --> 18:27.317
The only acceptable
approach here is hospice.

18:27.318 --> 18:28.982
This is a high-profile case.

18:28.983 --> 18:30.966
There's a family counting on us.

18:30.967 --> 18:32.472
And we will fail them.

18:33.633 --> 18:36.708
If so much as a cell, one
cell of tumor is missed,

18:36.709 --> 18:37.777
which we know will happen,

18:37.778 --> 18:39.149
the cancer will grow back

18:39.150 --> 18:42.040
before the patient even recovers
from this barbaric surgery.

18:42.041 --> 18:45.126
I'm gonna make sure this
poor woman understands that.

18:50.438 --> 18:52.617
Malia, Malia, Malia, Malia, grab him.

18:52.618 --> 18:54.493
- Oh.
- Hello, darling.

18:54.494 --> 18:55.776
You don't want to go out there.

18:55.777 --> 18:57.572
It's much nicer in here with Mummy.

18:57.573 --> 19:00.333
So, guys, hey, listen up.

19:00.334 --> 19:02.889
These are the doctors
that are gonna be helping

19:02.890 --> 19:04.579
Dr. Cain save Mom.

19:04.580 --> 19:06.547
- Can you say hey?
- You're gonna save Mom?

19:08.550 --> 19:10.051
Oh.

19:10.052 --> 19:13.211
Yeah. Hey, you know, I heard
that the cafeteria's having

19:13.212 --> 19:17.278
kind of a special on
ice cream sundaes today.

19:17.279 --> 19:19.551
Maybe you could go down there
and tell them Dr. Bell said

19:19.552 --> 19:20.704
to have a treat on him.

19:20.705 --> 19:22.097
Ice cream! Yay!

19:22.098 --> 19:24.866
Shh!

19:24.867 --> 19:26.601
Quiet, bunnies.

19:26.602 --> 19:28.870
All right.

19:28.871 --> 19:30.439
Hop, hop, hop.

19:30.440 --> 19:33.383
Hop, hop, hop, hop, hop, hop, hop,

19:33.384 --> 19:35.410
hop, hop, hop, hop.

19:35.411 --> 19:37.078
They're quite the handful.

19:40.249 --> 19:43.843
Malia should be in college right now.

19:43.844 --> 19:46.455
I have to get better so
I can take over again.

19:47.574 --> 19:49.942
Dawn, would you mind telling
me what you understand

19:49.943 --> 19:51.442
about your prognosis?

19:55.965 --> 19:58.075
I understand everything.

19:58.076 --> 20:00.661
In the best-case scenario,
this isn't a cure.

20:00.662 --> 20:04.414
There is only a slim hope
this will buy you more time.

20:04.415 --> 20:06.441
I'll take it.

20:06.442 --> 20:10.312
And do you also understand
that it's far more likely

20:10.313 --> 20:13.271
that you'll have less
time with your children?

20:13.272 --> 20:16.840
This surgery is so dangerous,
y-you may not survive.

20:19.302 --> 20:21.394
I'm dying anyway.

20:21.395 --> 20:23.638
The odds may be long

20:23.639 --> 20:26.441
that this will help,
but I want to beat them.

20:26.442 --> 20:28.700
And I want to help you, but...

20:28.701 --> 20:30.145
No buts.

20:30.146 --> 20:34.823
I will do anything, against any odds,

20:34.824 --> 20:36.450
to stay with my kids

20:36.451 --> 20:38.020
as long as I can.

20:39.826 --> 20:41.226
I can't give up.

20:45.906 --> 20:48.146
I still don't think there's
a chance that surgery

20:48.147 --> 20:50.089
is going to give that
poor woman more time.

20:50.090 --> 20:53.560
I have spoken to her at length,
and she understands that.

20:53.561 --> 20:56.470
Yeah, she seems perfectly
aware of the lunacy

20:56.471 --> 20:59.007
that is the Mother of All Surgeries.

20:59.008 --> 21:00.842
And in the end, it's her decision.

21:00.843 --> 21:03.511
Well, exactly, and she
is gonna have this surgery

21:03.512 --> 21:05.071
with or without Chastain.

21:05.072 --> 21:06.772
After her last TV appearance,

21:06.773 --> 21:08.625
other hospitals tried to poach her case.

21:08.626 --> 21:11.081
They're less qualified,
and they don't have you.

21:11.082 --> 21:13.003
Don't worry, I'm in.

21:14.489 --> 21:17.134
But not because I agree.

21:17.135 --> 21:20.053
But because I'm gonna make
good and damn well sure

21:20.054 --> 21:23.031
that Dawn makes it off that table alive

21:23.032 --> 21:25.613
and wakes up to have
as many days as possible

21:25.614 --> 21:27.852
with her children.

21:36.353 --> 21:39.638
The clinic costs Chastain
money, end of story.

21:39.639 --> 21:43.051
I have graphs and charts that
show it actually saves money

21:43.052 --> 21:44.310
by diverting the uninsured...

21:44.311 --> 21:46.613
Your charts don't include
infrastructure costs.

21:46.614 --> 21:48.723
And besides, what
matters most is income.

21:48.724 --> 21:50.667
With surgeons who
bill $80 million a year

21:50.668 --> 21:51.979
and do TV interviews.

21:51.980 --> 21:54.379
What benefits the bottom
line benefits everyone.

21:54.380 --> 21:57.090
So now it's profit and
publicity over patients.

21:57.091 --> 21:59.325
You forget yourself. I
care as much as you do

21:59.326 --> 22:00.388
about our patients.

22:00.389 --> 22:02.536
Everything I do, including publicity,

22:02.537 --> 22:04.239
is for profits and patients,

22:04.240 --> 22:06.223
because you can't have
one without the other.

22:07.161 --> 22:09.424
And by the way, I don't
owe you an explanation.

22:19.355 --> 22:20.888
These are all 3-D printed

22:20.889 --> 22:22.424
exact replicas of Dawn's anatomy.

22:22.425 --> 22:25.368
I downloaded all the
data from Dawn's 2-D scans

22:25.369 --> 22:26.975
and images into the computer,

22:26.976 --> 22:28.887
then the brain machine combines

22:28.888 --> 22:30.579
all that information and prints it out.

22:30.580 --> 22:33.100
And these tiny little
bumps on the kidneys...

22:33.869 --> 22:34.919
Are tumors.

22:37.256 --> 22:38.665
I only see three or so,

22:38.666 --> 22:41.367
but I feel at least seven more.

22:41.368 --> 22:44.946
It's part of the reason this
surgery is so complicated.

22:44.947 --> 22:48.238
We'll wear gloves and feel
for tumors, inch by inch,

22:48.239 --> 22:50.251
through the entire abdominal cavity.

22:50.252 --> 22:53.146
It'll take hours and
there is no room for error.

22:53.147 --> 22:54.898
Which is why you're practicing.

22:54.899 --> 22:57.475
Over and over.

22:57.476 --> 23:00.836
This is my third go and I
still haven't managed to remove

23:00.837 --> 23:03.034
the vertebral body without compromising

23:03.035 --> 23:06.400
the iliac artery, which is
plastered to it by the tumor.

23:06.974 --> 23:10.438
"Fake Dawn" has bled out every time.

23:10.439 --> 23:11.639
Come on, Pravesh.

23:11.640 --> 23:13.374
Spread the cavity.

23:15.535 --> 23:16.644
If the corpectomy

23:16.645 --> 23:19.422
is causing problems, should we
get Cain in here to rehearse?

23:19.423 --> 23:21.983
He thinks it's unnecessary.

23:21.984 --> 23:24.486
Bell didn't RSVP either.

23:24.487 --> 23:27.805
And believe me, this is not a
surgery that can be improvised.

23:41.362 --> 23:42.562
You like that car?

23:42.563 --> 23:44.731
It's hideous.

23:44.732 --> 23:46.599
I designed it.

23:46.600 --> 23:50.403
Frame-off restoration
built with these hands.

23:50.404 --> 23:52.905
It's my passion.

23:52.906 --> 23:54.782
It's what keeps me honest.

23:54.783 --> 23:56.650
Does it?

23:56.651 --> 23:58.221
That's funny, because you certainly

23:58.222 --> 23:59.713
didn't keep it honest with me.

23:59.714 --> 24:01.655
You knew you weren't
dying, neither am I.

24:01.656 --> 24:05.702
There is no alpha-1 deficiency
here, so I'm good, yo.

24:07.955 --> 24:09.756
Well, that's what you
wanted to hear, right?

24:09.757 --> 24:12.033
You wanted to know if I was
perfectly healthy, right?

24:12.034 --> 24:15.653
Well, yes, of course, but I thought...

24:15.654 --> 24:16.937
You thought what, Lamar?

24:18.799 --> 24:21.318
If you are my son...

24:21.319 --> 24:23.770
that the odds were you
would carry the gene.

24:23.771 --> 24:25.487
If?

24:30.719 --> 24:32.829
Wow, you don't know.

24:32.830 --> 24:35.147
That's why you came.

24:35.148 --> 24:36.783
What, you thought maybe Bio-Mom

24:36.784 --> 24:38.584
was sleeping around
when she got pregnant?

24:38.585 --> 24:39.985
Is that why you gave me away?

24:39.986 --> 24:41.496
Because you thought I
wasn't yours to begin with?

24:41.497 --> 24:42.863
I may not have raised you,

24:42.864 --> 24:45.383
but I'm not gonna stand here
and have you disrespect me.

24:45.384 --> 24:46.793
Well, then you sit your ass down,

24:46.794 --> 24:48.069
or you get the hell out of here.

24:48.070 --> 24:50.309
This is my house, Lamar.
You do not dictate

24:50.310 --> 24:52.814
to me how I speak to someone
I have no respect for.

24:52.815 --> 24:55.243
We were young. It was the '70s.

24:55.244 --> 24:58.188
And yes, there is a possibility
that you aren't mine.

24:58.189 --> 25:01.524
It sickens me to say
that all I have to do

25:01.525 --> 25:04.009
is look at you...

25:04.010 --> 25:06.070
and know who my father is.

25:07.623 --> 25:10.532
A proper DNA test will prove it.

25:13.079 --> 25:14.987
I can't change what we did.

25:14.988 --> 25:16.856
And apologizing

25:16.857 --> 25:18.899
- is not gonna make any...
- When did you apologize?!

25:18.900 --> 25:21.210
Let me speak!

25:22.571 --> 25:25.498
I wish we could go back
and make things right.

25:25.499 --> 25:28.853
It's something that eats at
your mother and me every day.

25:28.854 --> 25:31.212
That's why my marriage is in shambles.

25:31.213 --> 25:34.282
- And my life is on the verge of imploding.
- Your life?

25:34.283 --> 25:36.618
Man, think about who
you're talking to right now.

25:36.619 --> 25:39.420
Do you think I give a rat's
ass about your struggles?

25:39.421 --> 25:42.624
Is that what you really want
to talk to me about right now?

25:42.625 --> 25:46.069
- You want to speak? Answer me!
- I can't...

25:46.070 --> 25:50.022
S-Something ain't right.

25:50.023 --> 25:52.575
Hey, hey! I need some help over here!

25:52.576 --> 25:54.935
Watch his head.

25:54.936 --> 25:56.536
Put him down gently.
Let him down gently.

25:57.640 --> 25:59.360
I'll get a gurney.

26:06.424 --> 26:07.424
Good news.

26:07.425 --> 26:10.093
No sign of cancer on your ovaries.

26:10.094 --> 26:13.087
- I wasn't worried.
- I was.

26:13.088 --> 26:15.515
And I know I worry too much,
but it's only because...

26:15.516 --> 26:17.325
You love me. I get it.

26:17.326 --> 26:19.936
But I'm okay.

26:19.937 --> 26:21.994
You can relax now.

26:21.995 --> 26:25.407
Especially knowing that
there is a silver lining

26:25.408 --> 26:27.059
to all of this.

26:27.060 --> 26:28.611
Since you implanted your embryos,

26:28.612 --> 26:31.817
you were able to test them
for the BRCA gene mutation

26:31.818 --> 26:33.449
and select one without it.

26:36.737 --> 26:41.811
You did... select an embryo
that didn't carry the mutation?

26:43.649 --> 26:45.319
Oh, no. Please...

26:45.320 --> 26:48.047
Uh, what I've done is my decision, Mina.

26:48.048 --> 26:49.132
This is my life.

26:49.133 --> 26:50.616
It's not only yours, Adaku.

26:50.617 --> 26:52.764
It's also the life of your child.

26:52.765 --> 26:55.120
This awful disease killed
your mother and your sisters.

26:55.121 --> 26:56.906
With one test, you could have
protected your child from it.

26:56.907 --> 26:58.382
I will not play God.

26:58.383 --> 27:01.421
God answered my prayers. He delivered me

27:01.422 --> 27:04.764
- from breast cancer.
- I got you through breast cancer.

27:04.765 --> 27:07.424
I brought my mother from Nigeria
to come and operate on you.

27:07.425 --> 27:09.158
And I am so grateful.

27:09.159 --> 27:11.569
But I also see God's hand in that.

27:12.577 --> 27:14.716
Then why not see his
hand in genetic testing?

27:14.717 --> 27:17.160
Science froze your embryos,
medicine got you pregnant.

27:17.161 --> 27:19.053
Without doctors, you would have no baby.

27:19.054 --> 27:20.747
You wanted me to get an oophorectomy.

27:20.748 --> 27:23.225
If I followed your advice,
I'd have no baby.

27:23.226 --> 27:25.025
And now, all you're doing is,

27:25.026 --> 27:26.836
is judging me, trying to control me.

27:26.837 --> 27:29.196
I am doing all of this to help you.

27:29.197 --> 27:31.357
Can't you see I don't
want your help, Mina.

27:36.329 --> 27:37.680
I have to go.

27:37.681 --> 27:40.350
It's an emergency. Somebody
who does need my help.

27:40.351 --> 27:41.725
We will pick this up later.

27:43.357 --> 27:44.687
I think it's better if we don't.

27:44.688 --> 27:46.414
This is all...

27:46.415 --> 27:49.083
it's too much for me, Mina.

27:49.084 --> 27:50.317
Goodbye.

28:07.360 --> 28:08.402
What's this?

28:08.403 --> 28:11.134
Oh, this is Dawn's spinal column,

28:11.135 --> 28:13.925
with the tumor adhesions
that make it impossible

28:13.926 --> 28:16.335
to remove the cancer
without killing the patient.

28:16.336 --> 28:18.042
Something you would know

28:18.043 --> 28:21.048
had you bothered to attend
even one of my rehearsals.

28:21.049 --> 28:24.727
Your energy and your tone aside,

28:24.728 --> 28:26.232
I admire you, Dr. Voss.

28:26.233 --> 28:28.231
Your compulsive need to practice,

28:28.232 --> 28:29.781
it speaks to an obsession

28:29.782 --> 28:33.047
with the precise anatomy of the disease.

28:33.048 --> 28:35.020
And I get it. I get it,

28:35.021 --> 28:36.239
because the better you know your enemy

28:36.240 --> 28:38.800
before you meet face-to-face
on the battlefield...

28:38.801 --> 28:40.359
the better chance you have of victory.

28:40.360 --> 28:44.271
Oh, you do realize her
seven children are out there

28:44.272 --> 28:46.797
praying to God that this surgery works,

28:46.798 --> 28:50.244
having no idea that there
is zero chance for victory.

28:50.245 --> 28:51.904
This surgery will kill her.

28:51.905 --> 28:54.257
I used to be just like
you before I realized that

28:54.258 --> 28:57.334
all plans go out the
window when the war begins.

28:58.420 --> 29:01.680
Sounds like an excuse not to prepare.

29:05.311 --> 29:08.295
I get my head right with
my own pre-op ritual,

29:08.296 --> 29:12.257
in which you... are
currently interrupting.

29:12.258 --> 29:15.445
So if you'll excuse yourself,
I'd like to get back to it,

29:15.446 --> 29:19.173
because Malia, Timmy, Dani,
Tunde, Katie, Rosa and Arjun

29:19.174 --> 29:20.783
are all counting on me...

29:20.784 --> 29:23.228
not God, but me...

29:24.955 --> 29:29.249
to bring my A game and
save their mother's life.

29:47.278 --> 29:48.386
Hey.

29:48.387 --> 29:51.672
Verdict on your bio-father?

29:51.673 --> 29:54.709
Recent cath showed
triple vessel disease.

29:54.710 --> 29:57.269
And now he has diffuse ischemic changes.

29:57.270 --> 29:58.713
Who's doing the bypass?

29:58.714 --> 30:00.882
Sieve and Schoneveld are available.

30:00.883 --> 30:01.941
They're Red Rock guys.

30:01.942 --> 30:03.300
Do we know anything about them?

30:03.301 --> 30:05.578
So far, none of the new
hires are up to snuff.

30:05.579 --> 30:06.913
Forget these Red Rock surgeons.

30:06.914 --> 30:09.056
You should do the surgery.

30:09.057 --> 30:11.167
Lamar is his biological father.

30:11.168 --> 30:12.793
Even more reason to give
him the best surgeon.

30:12.794 --> 30:14.120
Who is one without baggage.

30:14.121 --> 30:15.672
You've told me if I had

30:15.673 --> 30:17.489
an emotional attachment to a patient,

30:17.490 --> 30:19.363
not to operate. Are you a hypocrite?

30:19.364 --> 30:21.569
Regardless of emotional attachments,

30:21.570 --> 30:23.804
you are his best chance at survival.

30:28.969 --> 30:30.889
I got to get my head on straight.

30:33.357 --> 30:35.607
Get all the emotion out of this.

30:46.445 --> 30:50.598
You got bad news written
all over your face.

30:50.599 --> 30:53.543
Now what could be worse
than three clogged arteries?

30:53.544 --> 30:56.587
The decision I have to make
in the next ten minutes.

30:56.588 --> 30:59.941
I am the right surgeon
to fix your heart,

30:59.942 --> 31:02.944
but you are not just any patient.

31:02.945 --> 31:06.464
Who you are and what transpired
between us plays in my mind

31:06.465 --> 31:09.558
and very well could infect these hands.

31:13.421 --> 31:16.315
I am an overachiever.

31:16.316 --> 31:20.236
Gifted with a competitive
nature and a need to excel

31:20.237 --> 31:22.405
from as young as I can remember.

31:22.406 --> 31:24.407
I collected academic awards

31:24.408 --> 31:26.558
like other kids
collected baseball cards.

31:26.559 --> 31:29.412
Spelling bee, debate team,
Eagle Scout, aikido...

31:29.413 --> 31:31.806
you name it, I mastered it.

31:31.807 --> 31:34.575
I had an addiction.

31:34.576 --> 31:39.330
This deep-rooted need to conquer all.

31:39.331 --> 31:42.817
You see, there's this tiny voice

31:42.818 --> 31:47.171
deep inside of me that
cannot be silenced,

31:47.172 --> 31:51.325
who always thought, "Maybe...

31:51.326 --> 31:53.886
maybe if they knew you were special,

31:53.887 --> 31:57.631
that... that maybe...

31:57.632 --> 32:00.817
Mom and Dad would come
knocking on that front door."

32:02.671 --> 32:05.781
Realize what they gave away.

32:07.676 --> 32:11.661
And that I was something
worth fighting to get back.

32:17.352 --> 32:19.669
You most certainly are.

32:29.256 --> 32:31.515
I'll see you in the OR.

32:48.879 --> 32:50.603
It's been over eight hours.

32:50.604 --> 32:52.328
Whose playlist is up next?

32:52.329 --> 32:53.888
Sound of the drill works for me.

32:53.889 --> 32:56.729
Once we're finished, Cain can work.

32:56.730 --> 32:58.447
Then we still have to do the chemo bath.

32:58.448 --> 33:01.003
If she's under anesthesia
too much longer,

33:01.004 --> 33:02.546
she'll never wake up.

33:12.707 --> 33:15.467
This tumor's eroded
through the bone entirely.

33:15.468 --> 33:17.303
I've dissected as much as I can

33:17.304 --> 33:19.413
off the iliac and lumbosacral plexus,

33:19.414 --> 33:21.473
but the arterial wall
has been compromised.

33:21.474 --> 33:23.550
Time to pull.

33:23.551 --> 33:25.652
Slow and steady.

33:27.192 --> 33:29.034
One moment.

33:49.386 --> 33:51.928
Got it.

33:53.056 --> 33:54.724
Deep breath worked the magic?

33:54.725 --> 33:58.552
Picturing her kids watching
me, hopeful. That's the magic.

33:58.553 --> 34:00.774
You ready for me yet?

34:00.775 --> 34:03.176
- All yours, Dr. Cain.
- It's about time.

34:03.177 --> 34:04.758
Get the microscope in place.

34:04.759 --> 34:07.536
I need somatosensory and
motor EPs on the screen.

34:07.537 --> 34:09.612
Foot and a half from
lead position. Eye level.

34:12.290 --> 34:13.739
A little room.

34:13.739 --> 34:15.873
We're gonna double-check
everything in the abdomen

34:15.875 --> 34:17.413
once you've finished to
make sure we've got it.

34:17.414 --> 34:18.447
How much longer?

34:18.447 --> 34:20.808
- Two more hours?
- Nope. Won't take that long.

34:20.809 --> 34:23.382
I need some curettes, couple of sutures,

34:23.382 --> 34:24.978
and some Megadeth on the jukebox.

34:24.980 --> 34:28.540
Spine surgeries beg
for headbanging tunes.

34:28.541 --> 34:29.949
Is that irony?

34:37.935 --> 34:41.962
Dissecting the tumor off the dural sac.

34:41.963 --> 34:44.106
Gonna need you to put some pressure

34:44.107 --> 34:46.333
right there, Dr. Voss.

34:46.333 --> 34:48.835
I know heavy equipment is Ortho's thing,

34:48.837 --> 34:52.114
but you're here on the
delicate side, so be gentle.

34:54.326 --> 34:55.784
♪ She had to know... ♪

34:55.786 --> 34:57.269
That's it. Onc intern,

34:57.270 --> 34:58.812
get that chemo bath ready.

34:58.813 --> 35:01.182
You're gonna need it a lot
sooner than these guys thought.

35:07.689 --> 35:11.276
- So how did it go?
- I'm fine, yo.

35:12.752 --> 35:14.594
I don't believe you.

35:16.682 --> 35:19.166
Well, I'm fine enough to do the surgery.

35:19.167 --> 35:21.626
But even if I'm wrong,

35:21.627 --> 35:23.503
you'll be there,

35:23.504 --> 35:27.433
and I know I can always count on you,

35:27.434 --> 35:29.056
my partner.

35:48.181 --> 35:49.977
I know everyone at Chastain

35:49.978 --> 35:53.867
did everything they could
to give my mom every chance,

35:53.868 --> 35:57.037
and I just want to thank you guys.

35:57.038 --> 35:59.964
Can you tell us how Dawn
is doing after surgery?

35:59.965 --> 36:01.756
Well, the hours that we spent preparing

36:01.757 --> 36:03.420
for the surgery have paid dividends.

36:03.421 --> 36:06.522
Still, Dawn has endured
17 hours of surgery.

36:06.523 --> 36:08.682
Her body is struggling to recover.

36:08.683 --> 36:10.601
She hasn't regained
consciousness and as yet,

36:10.602 --> 36:12.086
isn't able to breathe on her own.

36:12.087 --> 36:13.883
When is she gonna wake up?

36:13.884 --> 36:16.364
While we don't know for
certain, we're very optimistic.

36:17.345 --> 36:19.910
And, Dr. Cain, I just want
to thank you for giving

36:19.911 --> 36:21.620
my family hope when no one else would.

36:30.881 --> 36:34.166
We may be witnessing a
medical miracle in progress.

36:34.167 --> 36:36.114
Let's all pray for Dawn

36:36.115 --> 36:38.946
and give our gratitude to
this amazing team of doctors

36:38.947 --> 36:40.614
still fighting to save her.

36:40.615 --> 36:42.432
We'll be following
Dawn and Malia's story

36:42.433 --> 36:43.941
over the next few weeks.

36:43.942 --> 36:46.787
It's families like this,
bonding together in crisis,

36:46.788 --> 36:48.731
that inspire us all.

36:48.732 --> 36:50.624
You crashed here last night?

36:50.625 --> 36:53.277
Yeah. Surgery was long.

36:53.278 --> 36:55.977
My "Mother of All Surgeries"
patient was just on TV,

36:55.978 --> 36:57.740
and I wanted to catch
it before heading home.

36:57.741 --> 36:59.800
Barely made it out of surgery.

36:59.801 --> 37:02.078
They're calling it a success.

37:02.079 --> 37:05.289
Well, family's still together.

37:05.290 --> 37:07.248
Maybe that's enough, right?

37:11.313 --> 37:13.814
I don't know, man.

37:13.815 --> 37:15.424
You know, my first day at Chastain,

37:15.425 --> 37:17.176
I was planning on going into oncology.

37:17.177 --> 37:20.654
Mm, but then the infamous
Lane Hunter came along.

37:20.655 --> 37:22.756
Well, she was an anomaly.

37:22.757 --> 37:25.101
Criminal, psychopath.

37:25.102 --> 37:27.603
I mean, the majority of oncologists

37:27.604 --> 37:30.655
are caring people
dedicated to saving lives.

37:30.656 --> 37:33.651
When the treatment cures the
patient, that's one thing,

37:33.652 --> 37:36.061
but what may help one patient

37:36.062 --> 37:38.989
will harm or even kill another,
often without any benefit.

37:38.990 --> 37:41.342
It's impossible to know
where your patient will fall

37:41.343 --> 37:43.285
on that spectrum before
you start treating them.

37:43.286 --> 37:45.179
That's why, sometimes,
I miss being a medic

37:45.180 --> 37:48.791
with the patrol units downrange.
That job was clear.

37:48.792 --> 37:51.961
We could be proud of what we
did every day. No gray areas.

37:51.962 --> 37:53.878
But...

37:55.615 --> 37:56.841
... all this

37:56.842 --> 37:58.865
corporatized medicine,
profit over patients,

37:58.866 --> 38:01.195
I guess I just look at it as a
different kind of battlefield.

38:01.196 --> 38:03.722
One where we need to keep showing up,

38:03.723 --> 38:06.049
keep fighting, keep making a difference.

38:06.050 --> 38:08.644
No matter what the odds are against us.

38:08.645 --> 38:11.372
Yeah.

38:11.373 --> 38:12.939
Yeah.

38:24.485 --> 38:26.220
Big-time oncologist

38:26.221 --> 38:28.889
just couldn't stay away, huh?

38:28.890 --> 38:32.008
My toe! Oh, my God, I need a doctor!

38:32.009 --> 38:34.285
Looks like things got
out of control without me.

38:34.286 --> 38:37.187
Bed 4, perfect for you.

38:37.188 --> 38:40.367
You'll want a wardrobe
change and some gloves.

38:40.368 --> 38:41.627
What's the bullet?

38:41.628 --> 38:43.721
Patient's been stopped up for weeks.

38:43.722 --> 38:45.805
Disimpaction time.

38:47.350 --> 38:48.684
I'm on it.

38:48.685 --> 38:51.686
Watch out, she's a biter.

38:57.534 --> 38:59.867
I can never thank you enough. Thank you.

38:59.868 --> 39:02.356
Oh, you're more than welcome.

39:02.357 --> 39:04.200
Seriously, people need to know about it.

39:04.201 --> 39:08.095
- Just excuse me for a second.
- Yeah.

39:08.096 --> 39:10.155
I am so impressed with
what you guys are doing here.

39:10.156 --> 39:11.782
I'm telling you, the world
needs to know about this.

39:11.783 --> 39:13.658
Well, thank you so
much. I appreciate it.

39:13.659 --> 39:15.125
Especially at a time right now where...

39:15.126 --> 39:16.328
Dr. Bell.

39:16.329 --> 39:18.562
Nurse Nevin has been
telling me about the clinic.

39:18.563 --> 39:20.832
I was just saying how invested you are

39:20.833 --> 39:22.668
in our service to the uninsured.

39:22.669 --> 39:24.302
How you care about all of our patients,

39:24.303 --> 39:25.957
not just the big newsworthy cases.

39:25.958 --> 39:27.386
I'm telling you, Dr. Bell,

39:27.387 --> 39:29.950
- he's one of the good ones.
- Well, as a nonprofit,

39:29.951 --> 39:33.129
charity work is an essential
part of Chastain's mission.

39:33.130 --> 39:34.737
You know, I can see the segment now:

39:34.738 --> 39:38.442
"World-renowned surgeon makes
time for the disadvantaged."

39:38.443 --> 39:39.484
You in?

39:40.907 --> 39:42.449
- Just say when.
- Come on now.

39:42.450 --> 39:43.722
Thank you, sir.

39:43.723 --> 39:44.823
- And thank you.
- Thank you.

39:44.824 --> 39:46.041
Yes, ma'am.

39:48.578 --> 39:49.695
Let's go.

39:49.696 --> 39:51.838
Neat trick.

39:51.839 --> 39:53.873
It won't work again.

40:02.650 --> 40:06.428
I made this for the baby.

40:06.429 --> 40:07.988
Is this your apology?

40:07.989 --> 40:10.957
I can't apologize for wishing
you'd done genetic testing,

40:10.958 --> 40:12.986
but it is your choice,

40:12.987 --> 40:15.812
and I am sorry I did not respect that.

40:17.190 --> 40:18.691
Thank you.

40:18.692 --> 40:20.962
Come in. I'm filling
out my baby registry.

40:20.963 --> 40:22.611
Do you think I need a baby bouncy?

40:22.612 --> 40:24.339
I have no idea what that is.

40:24.340 --> 40:27.007
Me either, but we can
figure it out together, yes?

40:27.008 --> 40:30.777
Sounds awful, but I can't think
of anything else I'd rather do.

40:30.778 --> 40:31.945
Aw.

40:31.946 --> 40:35.615
On three. One, two,

40:35.616 --> 40:38.285
three.

40:40.621 --> 40:42.689
What?

40:42.690 --> 40:44.383
How did you get this place?

40:44.384 --> 40:47.260
Dumb luck or karma. It just
came back on the market.

40:52.091 --> 40:56.428
Whatever it is, I'm so
happy we're here now.

40:56.429 --> 40:59.172
Ah.

40:59.173 --> 41:01.150
When you brought me here the first time,

41:01.151 --> 41:03.477
it's just I had so much
going on, you know?

41:03.478 --> 41:04.878
And you still do,

41:06.037 --> 41:08.115
but we will get through it all together.

41:08.116 --> 41:09.158
I know.

41:11.161 --> 41:14.388
Are you sure right now is the
right time to make this move?

41:14.389 --> 41:17.224
I've never been so sure.

41:24.716 --> 41:27.626
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

41:27.627 --> 41:29.736
And I love this house.

41:29.737 --> 41:32.872
Well, get ready to love it more.

41:35.635 --> 41:37.019
Ta-da!

41:37.020 --> 41:40.138
Oh, my God!

41:40.139 --> 41:44.851
- We have chickens.
- Oh!

41:44.852 --> 41:46.986
Wow!

41:55.896 --> 41:59.562
Engine still purring
like a '69 Firebird?

42:01.452 --> 42:03.437
Incision is healing well.

42:03.438 --> 42:05.572
Your heart function and rhythm sounds

42:05.573 --> 42:07.198
within normal range.

42:07.199 --> 42:09.943
Your cardiologist can
manage your recovery.

42:09.944 --> 42:12.212
- Good luck.
- Wait.

42:13.673 --> 42:15.525
Don't go. Please.

42:17.218 --> 42:20.387
My mind and mouth move at the same time.

42:20.388 --> 42:23.790
I act before I think
things through all the way.

42:23.791 --> 42:27.853
Character flaw. I'm working on it.

42:27.854 --> 42:29.762
I did what I did

42:29.763 --> 42:32.557
and I want to do better.

42:32.558 --> 42:35.243
If you can't forgive, I
have to live with that.

42:37.104 --> 42:40.307
But my wife, your mother,

42:41.466 --> 42:44.569
is better than me in every way.

42:44.570 --> 42:47.414
She never would've messed
things up the way I did.

42:49.984 --> 42:51.719
I wouldn't know.

42:53.671 --> 42:56.490
My hope is that you'll reach out to her,

42:56.491 --> 42:58.016
when you're ready.

42:58.017 --> 43:01.687
She's truly special,

43:01.688 --> 43:04.188
like you.

43:09.112 --> 43:10.946
Goodbye, Lamar.
