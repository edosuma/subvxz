09:40.654 --> 09:42.487

09:50.164 --> 09:52.130

09:54.551 --> 09:56.551

since graduation.

09:58.671 --> 10:00.622

I was...

10:00.624 --> 10:04.092
I was really looking forward to
catching up with her, you know?

10:04.094 --> 10:06.178
It had been so long.

10:06.180 --> 10:08.713
But she seemed
so anxious.

10:08.715 --> 10:11.633
Hmm. How so?

10:11.635 --> 10:13.968
Oh, it was weird. It was...

10:13.970 --> 10:17.305
She was asking what we had
planned for the night.

10:17.307 --> 10:20.025
Was there any event
in particular

10:20.027 --> 10:21.526
she was curious about?

10:21.528 --> 10:24.112
No. No, she just...

10:24.114 --> 10:25.813
she grabbed a program

10:25.815 --> 10:29.317
and then she said
that we'd catch up later.

10:29.319 --> 10:33.121
And then...

10:33.123 --> 10:36.625
and then...

10:38.494 --> 10:39.711
Okay.

10:39.713 --> 10:42.013
Hey, it's okay.

10:42.015 --> 10:45.016

We're... Okay.

10:47.104 --> 10:49.804

10:55.362 --> 10:59.781
Laura and I dated all through
senior year, but, uh...

10:59.783 --> 11:02.117
we broke up before school ended.

11:02.119 --> 11:04.653
We were going to
different colleges.

11:06.990 --> 11:10.742
We didn't think that we could
handle the long-distance thing.

11:10.744 --> 11:12.911
We didn't stay in touch
after that.

11:12.913 --> 11:15.247
Did you talk to her
this afternoon?

11:15.249 --> 11:18.650
I tried, but she was
kind of distracted.

11:20.453 --> 11:22.320
She said that she
would find me later.

11:22.322 --> 11:25.724
It sounds like that's what
Laura was saying to everyone.

11:25.726 --> 11:28.393
Do you have any idea
what had her so preoccupied?

11:30.212 --> 11:31.930
When she walked in,

11:31.932 --> 11:34.716
I was so glad to
see her, you know?

11:34.718 --> 11:37.218
It had been so long.

11:37.220 --> 11:39.905
I guess... I guess
I was just hoping

11:39.907 --> 11:42.908
that she missed
the old gang and...

11:42.910 --> 11:44.743
that she was here
to catch up.

11:49.498 --> 11:50.749
Excuse me. Thank you.

11:55.237 --> 11:58.456
You getting
the same story I am?

11:58.458 --> 11:59.758
Yeah. Laura was
distracted,

11:59.760 --> 12:01.743
and anyone who
wanted to talk to her,

12:01.745 --> 12:03.595
she said she'd find them later.
Right.

12:03.597 --> 12:05.213
So then the question
is: why would Laura

12:05.215 --> 12:07.382
come all the way back for
her high school reunion

12:07.384 --> 12:09.718
if she had no interest
in reuniting?

12:09.720 --> 12:10.936
Hey, guys.

12:10.938 --> 12:13.921
So CSU found Laura's purse
in the P.A. room

12:13.923 --> 12:16.424
with a cash withdrawal receipt
from Bank of Waikiki

12:16.426 --> 12:18.059
for $200,000.

12:20.196 --> 12:23.264
Time stamp is 1:58 p.m., which
means that she went to a bank

12:23.266 --> 12:25.333
two hours before she
got to the reunion.

12:25.335 --> 12:27.152
Okay, so did CSU
recover the money?

12:27.154 --> 12:29.237
No, nothing on her person
or in her rental car.

12:29.239 --> 12:30.322
The money's gone.

12:30.324 --> 12:32.207
Okay, so maybe
this is a robbery.

12:32.209 --> 12:34.209
Someone followed her
from the bank to the reunion.

12:34.211 --> 12:36.161
No, there's no way she's
walking around the school gym

12:36.163 --> 12:38.163
with $200,000
stuffed in her purse.

12:39.332 --> 12:40.832
Okay, then where is it?

12:47.006 --> 12:49.724
Commander, I was told that
you were out of town.

12:49.726 --> 12:52.310
Yeah, I just got back.

12:52.312 --> 12:54.629
Uh, and I need a favor, Max.

12:54.631 --> 12:56.220
I take it this is more
of the unofficial kind?

12:56.245 --> 12:57.132
It is.

12:57.133 --> 12:59.901
I need you to run DNA on that
for me, please.

13:00.603 --> 13:02.020
Uh, hey...

13:02.022 --> 13:03.989
best you don't
ask any questions, Max.

13:05.741 --> 13:08.743
Thanks.

13:08.745 --> 13:10.278
Welcome home.

13:10.280 --> 13:11.613
Thanks.

13:11.615 --> 13:13.365
You find what you were
looking for?

13:13.367 --> 13:15.316
Uh, working on it.

13:15.318 --> 13:17.118
I'd ask you how the
reunion was going,

13:17.120 --> 13:19.120
but the body bag
kind of gives it away.

13:19.122 --> 13:20.922
Yeah. Let's take a ride,
I'll fill you in.

13:20.924 --> 13:22.290
All right.

13:34.687 --> 13:36.054
<i>I can't believe this.</i>

13:36.056 --> 13:38.473
<i>I-I didn't even know</i>
<i>she was in town.</i>

13:38.475 --> 13:39.841
Did she call you?

13:39.843 --> 13:41.393
No, I had no idea.

13:41.395 --> 13:43.495
Why did Laura leave
Oahu after high school?

13:43.497 --> 13:46.180
College.
In New York.

13:46.182 --> 13:48.983
We thought she'd come
home afterwards, but...

13:48.985 --> 13:51.119
She said she liked the cold.

13:51.121 --> 13:53.121
That it suited her.

13:53.123 --> 13:56.658
Laura battled depression
a long time.

13:56.660 --> 13:59.694
After our parents died,
years would go by

13:59.696 --> 14:01.713
when she wouldn't
contact us at all,

14:01.715 --> 14:03.381
wouldn't come home for holidays.

14:03.383 --> 14:05.834
When was the last time
you heard from her?

14:05.836 --> 14:06.918
A few weeks ago.

14:06.920 --> 14:09.504
I remember she sounded, uh...

14:11.674 --> 14:13.141
...better.

14:13.143 --> 14:15.877
Maybe it was
wishful thinking on my part,

14:15.879 --> 14:19.380
but she sounded happier,
stronger.

14:19.382 --> 14:23.217
Like she was finally
finding her way.

14:23.219 --> 14:25.386
You know, after Laura landed,
she stopped at the Bank

14:25.388 --> 14:28.857
of Waikiki and withdrew $200,000
from your family's trust.

14:28.859 --> 14:31.659
Any idea why
she might've done that?

14:31.661 --> 14:33.895
No, that would be
very unlike her.

14:33.897 --> 14:36.247
Laura rarely took
from the trust.

14:36.249 --> 14:37.999
Uh, she didn't want
the family money.

14:38.001 --> 14:40.702
It was a... a point of
pride with her, you know?

14:40.704 --> 14:43.404
She could... she could
take care of herself.

14:44.290 --> 14:45.740
Excuse me.

14:49.595 --> 14:51.129
Hey, Kono. What's up?

14:51.131 --> 14:53.264
So the prints came back
from the playing card

14:53.266 --> 14:54.749
that we found
on Laura's body.

14:54.751 --> 14:56.417
They belong to
an Anthony Gibson.

14:56.419 --> 14:58.419
Tony Gibson?

14:58.421 --> 15:00.388
He was in my chem class
senior year.

15:00.390 --> 15:03.057
Well, he's been a very
busy boy since graduation.

15:03.059 --> 15:05.560
There's a warrant out for him
in St. Petersburg, Florida.

15:05.562 --> 15:07.228
He's a person of interest

15:07.230 --> 15:10.064
in a case down there involving
blackmail and extortion.

15:10.066 --> 15:11.950
Yeah, I remember
seeing him at the reunion.

15:11.952 --> 15:13.201
Yeah, well, by the time HPD

15:13.203 --> 15:14.702
locked it down,
he was long gone.

15:14.704 --> 15:15.703
He was never questioned.

15:15.705 --> 15:16.955
Any idea where he is now?

15:16.957 --> 15:19.073
Yeah, I ran his phone;
it put him at

15:19.075 --> 15:20.942
the Pacific Marina Inn.
Danny's already on his way.

15:20.944 --> 15:22.076
He'll meet you guys there.

15:22.078 --> 15:24.162
All right, good work.

15:39.678 --> 15:41.579
Hello?

15:49.605 --> 15:50.738
Hey.

15:50.740 --> 15:51.773
You find Tony Gibson?

15:51.775 --> 15:53.408
Voilà.

15:55.995 --> 15:59.914
Nothing up my sleeve
and nothing in my...

15:59.916 --> 16:01.366
wallet!

16:01.368 --> 16:02.617
Ho!

16:03.653 --> 16:05.152
Thank you.

16:05.154 --> 16:08.089
Thank you. Just a normal wallet,
you can see that.

16:08.091 --> 16:10.875
And remember, though,
what they say about money--

16:10.877 --> 16:12.927
it can really burn a hole

16:12.929 --> 16:14.161
- in your pocket.
- Oh.

16:14.163 --> 16:16.014
Oh!

16:17.551 --> 16:18.633
Thank you, sir.

16:18.635 --> 16:20.301
You can count it;

16:20.303 --> 16:22.637
it's almost all there.

16:22.639 --> 16:25.306
You guys are great.
Really great crowd.

16:28.611 --> 16:31.613
Okay, for my next trick,
I need everybody

16:31.615 --> 16:33.064
to come up to the stage, okay?

16:33.066 --> 16:34.849
Everybody,
come on up to the stage.

16:34.851 --> 16:36.401
That's right, get close.

16:36.403 --> 16:37.652
Move on down.

16:37.654 --> 16:40.455
It doesn't work
if you're not here with me.

16:54.327 --> 16:55.943
Let me out of here!

16:55.945 --> 16:57.329
Come on!

16:57.331 --> 16:59.080
Let you out of here?
Houdini, that's on you.

16:59.082 --> 17:00.165
Let's see it.

17:00.167 --> 17:02.784
My leg's cramping.

17:02.786 --> 17:04.002
What the hell do you guys want?

17:04.003 --> 17:05.619
We want to talk to you
about your latest trick,

17:05.622 --> 17:07.555
disappearing from
a murder scene, okay?

17:07.557 --> 17:09.473
Put your hands on the car.
Murder? What murder?

17:09.476 --> 17:10.592
Chin, this is a joke, right?

17:10.594 --> 17:11.643
Make it easy on yourself

17:11.645 --> 17:13.645
and do what the man says.

17:14.930 --> 17:17.432
Hey, you know, the
only thing that I despise

17:17.434 --> 17:19.684
more than a clown
is a magician.

17:19.685 --> 17:21.986
Well, I'm an illusionist, thank you.
Oh, illusionist.

17:21.988 --> 17:22.987
What does that mean?

17:22.989 --> 17:24.521
It's different.

17:24.523 --> 17:26.191
It's different, Danny.

17:37.753 --> 17:39.371
Really?

17:39.373 --> 17:41.089
The cut and restored
rope trick.

17:41.091 --> 17:43.208
You know I was doing this in
the fourth grade? He's good.

17:43.210 --> 17:45.427
Come on, Amazing.

17:49.298 --> 17:51.299
All right, Tony.

17:51.301 --> 17:52.967
Let's talk.

17:52.969 --> 17:54.302
Oh!

17:55.388 --> 17:57.338
Let's see your average magician
do that.

17:57.340 --> 17:59.140
That's pretty
impressive, man.

17:59.142 --> 18:00.725
How about jail cells?
You good with those?

18:00.727 --> 18:02.727
I don't play small rooms.
But you guys obviously

18:02.729 --> 18:04.112
think I belong there
for some reason.

18:04.114 --> 18:05.230
Yeah, we do,

18:05.232 --> 18:07.065
and her name was Laura Richmond.

18:07.067 --> 18:08.149
Maybe you remember her.

18:08.151 --> 18:09.183
Yeah.

18:09.185 --> 18:10.518
Ah!

18:10.520 --> 18:11.820
Of course.

18:11.822 --> 18:13.521
We all went to Kukui together.

18:14.240 --> 18:15.523
All right, well,

18:15.525 --> 18:16.958
we would like to know why

18:16.960 --> 18:19.494
you went to the reunion
and killed her.

18:25.418 --> 18:26.751
What?

18:26.753 --> 18:27.969
That was pretty good.

18:27.971 --> 18:30.204
You ever think about giving up
being an illusionist

18:30.206 --> 18:31.423
and, uh, maybe try acting?

18:31.425 --> 18:33.341
Hey, you know what,
I hear Halawa Prison

18:33.343 --> 18:34.309
has a really good
theater troupe.

18:34.311 --> 18:35.427
Yeah?
Yeah.

18:35.429 --> 18:37.044
Halawa? Guys, come on.

18:37.046 --> 18:38.396
I-I didn't kill anybody, okay?

18:38.398 --> 18:40.265
I didn't even know
Laura was dead.

18:42.485 --> 18:43.902
Chin, dude,

18:43.904 --> 18:45.904
you know me.

18:45.906 --> 18:47.772
We were lab partners
all senior year.

18:47.774 --> 18:49.824
Yeah, as deep as that bond runs,

18:49.826 --> 18:51.392
I'm not about to look
the other way

18:51.394 --> 18:52.911
when you murder one
of our classmates.

18:52.913 --> 18:56.948
Guys, I swear,
I didn't kill anybody, okay?

18:56.950 --> 18:59.200
Why would I kill Laura?
I liked Laura.

18:59.202 --> 19:00.618
I don't know, uh, personally,

19:00.620 --> 19:02.504
I think it's probably got
something to do with blackmail,

19:02.506 --> 19:04.706
which is the same thing
you're wanted for

19:04.708 --> 19:06.073
in Florida, right?

19:07.343 --> 19:09.260
So, how did it
work, Amazing?

19:09.262 --> 19:10.411
You got some dir Laura,

19:10.413 --> 19:11.880
and you knew
she had some nut money.

19:11.882 --> 19:13.681
You thought it was gonna be
an easy payday, right?

19:13.683 --> 19:16.417
So she shows up at the
reunion with all that cash,

19:16.419 --> 19:17.852
but somehow the deal
goes sideways.

19:17.854 --> 19:19.587
You kill her,
and then you take off

19:19.589 --> 19:21.422
before we open the time capsule;
that sound about right?

19:21.424 --> 19:25.193
First of all,
that whole blackmail business

19:25.195 --> 19:28.863
in Florida was a giant
misunderstanding, okay?

19:28.865 --> 19:30.448
And second of all,

19:30.450 --> 19:32.534
I only bailed early
on the reunion

19:32.536 --> 19:35.703
because the hotel called, said
their Friday night act canceled

19:35.705 --> 19:37.071
and could I fill in.

19:37.073 --> 19:39.791
I need the cash, so I split.

19:39.793 --> 19:42.043
How do you explain this?

19:44.447 --> 19:46.915
Seriously? Yeah.

19:46.917 --> 19:48.800
I planted those
on a bunch of people,

19:48.802 --> 19:49.918
Laura included.

19:49.920 --> 19:51.169
It's my trademark.

19:51.971 --> 19:53.171
What do you mean,
your trademark?

19:53.173 --> 19:54.889
I was gonna do the
spectator's pocket bit

19:54.891 --> 19:56.624
before the night was over.

19:56.626 --> 19:58.309
'Cause the chicks dig it.

19:59.178 --> 20:00.728
This guy knows
what I'm talking about.

20:00.730 --> 20:01.980
Right?
Don't do that.

20:01.982 --> 20:03.932
Okay, look, I'll prove it.
Chin?

20:12.608 --> 20:15.360
Check your left jacket pocket.

20:17.646 --> 20:18.947
Ace of spades.

20:22.201 --> 20:23.451
Uh-oh.

20:23.453 --> 20:25.203
How does he do it?

20:25.205 --> 20:26.254
You're still annoying, though.

20:29.174 --> 20:31.593
Well, aloha.

20:31.595 --> 20:33.828
Ever consider
a career in show business?

20:33.830 --> 20:35.380
'Cause I could
always use

20:35.382 --> 20:38.182
a box jumper, especially one
as smoking hot as you.

20:38.184 --> 20:40.351
Hey, open your mouth again,
Tony,

20:40.353 --> 20:44.105
I'm gonna show you
the disappearing teeth trick.

20:46.842 --> 20:49.010
What do you got?

20:49.012 --> 20:51.062
Okay, so,

20:51.064 --> 20:52.647
Pacific Marina confirmed
that Tony arrived

20:52.649 --> 20:54.866
prior to Laura's T.O.D.

20:54.868 --> 20:55.900
Oh, great,
so that clears this guy.

20:55.902 --> 20:57.235
Well, I also dumped

20:57.237 --> 20:58.786
Laura's phone, which
led me to finding out

20:58.788 --> 21:00.521
what happened to
the missing 200K.

21:00.523 --> 21:02.073
So, after she landed,

21:02.075 --> 21:03.658
Laura made a call
to Honolulu General.

21:03.660 --> 21:05.960
And I spoke with an
administrator there

21:05.962 --> 21:07.745
who met with her shortly
before the reunion.

21:07.747 --> 21:11.165
It turns out that Laura paid for
a patient's entire hospital bill

21:11.167 --> 21:13.384
in cash, and she wanted
to be anonymous.

21:13.386 --> 21:16.004
It was $198,756.

21:16.006 --> 21:18.506
Patient's name
is Nina Johnson.

21:18.508 --> 21:20.758
And what's her connection
to Laura?

21:20.760 --> 21:21.976
I don't know;
I couldn't find one.

21:21.978 --> 21:23.177
"Couldn't find one"?

21:23.179 --> 21:25.313
What, is it just
a random act of kindness?

21:25.315 --> 21:26.881
No, if she came back here
after all this time,

21:26.883 --> 21:28.316
I don't think anything she did
was random.

21:28.318 --> 21:29.717
I agree, I agree.
Listen, see if

21:29.719 --> 21:31.436
you can track down Nina Johnson,
see what she knows.

21:31.438 --> 21:33.821
If we can figure out
why Laura came back,

21:33.823 --> 21:36.157
maybe we can work out
why she was killed.

21:48.187 --> 21:50.054
Jerry, you should go home.

21:51.825 --> 21:53.625
I know.

21:57.429 --> 21:59.714
She was always
so nice to me.

22:00.716 --> 22:02.951
I mean, you might
not believe this,

22:02.953 --> 22:04.969
but I wasn't very
popular back in the day.

22:04.971 --> 22:06.754
But Laura...

22:06.756 --> 22:08.973
even though she was
one of the cool kids,

22:08.975 --> 22:12.276
she always went out of
her way to talk to me.

22:12.278 --> 22:14.762
I really appreciated it.

22:16.532 --> 22:19.934
I'm just sorry I never
got to tell her.

22:19.936 --> 22:23.905
Jerry, we're gonna
find out who did this.

22:23.907 --> 22:26.774
I'd like to help.

22:26.776 --> 22:28.326
I know.

22:28.328 --> 22:32.446
And when we need you,
I promise you we will call.

22:35.918 --> 22:38.052
I found some
rather curious chemicals

22:38.054 --> 22:39.337
on the victim's
right hand.

22:39.339 --> 22:41.089
According to the lab,
it is a combination

22:41.091 --> 22:43.141
of metol, phenidone
and hydroquinone--

22:43.143 --> 22:45.343
chemicals commonly found
together in developer.

22:45.345 --> 22:47.979
Developer?
Like in a dark room?

22:47.981 --> 22:48.963
Precisely.

22:48.965 --> 22:50.565
Okay, Laura was
only on the island

22:50.567 --> 22:52.800
for about six hours,
so it seems kind of odd

22:52.802 --> 22:53.851
that she'd be developing photos.

22:53.853 --> 22:55.520
Indeed.
And I didn't find any traces

22:55.522 --> 22:58.906
of the chemical on <i>both</i> hands,
so I suspect it was a transfer.

22:58.908 --> 23:02.143
Which means it could have
come from her killer.

23:24.016 --> 23:26.050
How was your trip?

23:26.052 --> 23:27.518
What?

23:27.520 --> 23:29.120
Your little mission
in Cambodia.

23:29.122 --> 23:31.472
I don't know
what you're talking about.

23:31.474 --> 23:32.857
You don't know <i>me,</i> all right?

23:32.859 --> 23:35.143
And you need to believe me
when I tell you

23:35.145 --> 23:36.944
I'm not gonna quit,
I'm not gonna stop,

23:36.946 --> 23:38.646
I'm gonna do everything
I have to do

23:38.648 --> 23:40.615
until I find out
who was in that grave.

23:40.617 --> 23:44.786
I guarantee that will be the
biggest mistake of your life.

23:44.788 --> 23:46.287
You know what? Stop.
No more threats.

23:46.289 --> 23:48.072
No more threats.

23:48.074 --> 23:49.690
What are you doing?

23:50.542 --> 23:51.959
Take it.

23:51.961 --> 23:53.878
You want to stop me,
that's the only way

23:53.880 --> 23:55.362
you're gonna stop me.
Take it.

24:00.369 --> 24:03.337
My office. Twenty hundred.

24:14.349 --> 24:15.733
Are you serious?

24:15.735 --> 24:17.435
This woman paid
my hospital bill?

24:17.437 --> 24:19.520
So you don't know her?

24:19.522 --> 24:21.322
No.

24:21.324 --> 24:22.774
I've never seen her before.

24:22.776 --> 24:25.243
I-I wish I could help you,

24:25.245 --> 24:27.895
but none of this
makes any sense.

24:27.897 --> 24:29.396
I'm sorry.

24:29.398 --> 24:30.898
That's all right.

24:30.900 --> 24:33.785
Pipeline Junior Nationals.
That's impressive.

24:33.787 --> 24:37.755
Oh, that was my son
Corey's trophy.

24:37.757 --> 24:38.956
Wait a minute, Corey Johnson?

24:38.958 --> 24:41.175
I remember his name
when I was coming up

24:41.177 --> 24:42.877
as a surfer.
Well, if you think

24:42.879 --> 24:46.214
that's impressive, you
should see his room.

24:46.216 --> 24:49.717
They said my boy could have
been a world champion.

24:49.719 --> 24:51.269
Could have?

24:51.271 --> 24:55.089
He disappeared
almost 25 years ago.

24:55.091 --> 24:56.941
What happened?

24:56.943 --> 24:58.392
Full moon.

24:58.394 --> 25:01.562
He went out one night to surf,
and he never came home.

25:01.564 --> 25:04.982
The police said he must
have drowned, but in my heart,

25:04.984 --> 25:07.618
I never believed it.

25:07.620 --> 25:10.037
They never even found his body.

25:13.709 --> 25:16.410
Kelly Slater
came in second.

25:17.880 --> 25:19.613
You must have been
very proud.

25:19.615 --> 25:20.748
Mm-hmm.

25:37.649 --> 25:39.767
Chin.

25:46.074 --> 25:47.825
Mrs. Johnson,
do you know who this is

25:47.827 --> 25:49.110
with your son?

25:50.863 --> 25:52.646
They seem very close.

25:52.648 --> 25:56.200
Teenage boys
don't tell their moms a lot.

25:56.202 --> 25:57.335
Why do you ask?

25:57.337 --> 25:58.953
Well, because the girl
in the photo

25:58.955 --> 26:01.956
is Laura Richmond, the woman
who paid your hospital bill.

26:10.182 --> 26:11.665
You know,
judging from those photos,

26:11.667 --> 26:14.135
it looks like Corey and Laura
were seeing each other.

26:14.137 --> 26:16.137
Yeah. Which is interesting,
because when I interviewed

26:16.139 --> 26:17.355
Alan Lim at the reunion,

26:17.357 --> 26:19.173
he said <i>he</i> and Laura were
dating all senior year.

26:19.175 --> 26:21.342
Yeah, they were.
Everyone knew it.

26:22.277 --> 26:24.612
You know, Corey went
to a different school,

26:24.614 --> 26:27.064
so Laura could have been
seeing him on the side,

26:27.066 --> 26:28.366
and maybe Lim found out.

26:28.368 --> 26:31.202
You're thinking Alan
killed Corey out of jealously.

26:31.204 --> 26:32.620
25 years ago.

26:32.622 --> 26:34.121
You know, not only that,

26:34.123 --> 26:36.357
I'm thinking she might have
had knowledge of it,

26:36.359 --> 26:37.708
and that's why she paid
Nina's medical bill.

26:37.710 --> 26:39.160
Out of guilt.
Okay.

26:39.162 --> 26:42.513
Still doesn't explain why
Laura was killed yesterday.

26:43.415 --> 26:44.982
Well, maybe paying those bills

26:44.984 --> 26:46.467
wasn't enough
to ease her conscience.

26:46.469 --> 26:48.052
Maybe she was finally
gonna say something

26:48.054 --> 26:49.170
about what happened
to Corey.

26:49.172 --> 26:51.205
You know, if she was
and Alan knew it,

26:51.207 --> 26:53.674
that's a pretty strong motive
for him to kill her.

27:04.552 --> 27:05.937
Hey, what happened?

27:05.939 --> 27:07.738
Neighbor called it in.

27:07.740 --> 27:09.556
Said she heard
a disturbance.

27:09.558 --> 27:10.724
Looks like a possible
home invasion.

27:10.726 --> 27:13.160
That man's our
suspect in a homicide.

27:13.162 --> 27:14.946
Is he gonna make it?
Don't know.

27:14.948 --> 27:17.164
We are bringing in a male,
approximately 40 years old.

27:17.166 --> 27:18.282
Severe trauma.
I repeat...

27:37.666 --> 27:39.426
First on scene thinks
it was a home invasion.

27:39.785 --> 27:41.068
You believe that?

27:41.070 --> 27:42.703
Well, Laura Richmond
and Alan Lim

27:42.705 --> 27:44.371
were both at the reunion.

27:44.373 --> 27:46.457
Laura's in the morgue
and now Alan's in the E.R.

27:46.459 --> 27:47.508
I don't think
that's a coincidence.

27:47.510 --> 27:48.625
All right. Both assaults

27:48.627 --> 27:50.427
were up close and personal,
with no weapons.

27:50.429 --> 27:51.545
They knew their
attacker.

27:51.547 --> 27:52.579
All right, so right now,

27:52.581 --> 27:54.431
Alan is the only guy
who can give us an I.D.

27:54.433 --> 27:56.433
I want an officer
with him at all times.

27:56.435 --> 27:57.468
The minute he wakes up,

27:57.470 --> 27:59.136
I want someone there
to take his statement.

27:59.138 --> 28:00.054
Copy that.

28:01.057 --> 28:02.422
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
it's Max.

28:02.424 --> 28:03.924
Hey, Max.
You got something?

28:03.926 --> 28:05.258
Commander McGarrett,

28:05.260 --> 28:06.643
I'm so sorry to give you
this news, uh,

28:06.645 --> 28:07.945
but I don't know what happened.
I...

28:07.947 --> 28:09.279
Max. Relax.

28:09.281 --> 28:11.448
What's going on?

28:11.450 --> 28:12.649
The sample you gave me.

28:12.651 --> 28:14.935
I sent it over to the lab
for processing, but...

28:14.937 --> 28:16.269
they say it never arrived.

28:16.821 --> 28:18.372
Very predictable.

28:18.374 --> 28:20.207
I'm doing whatever I can

28:20.209 --> 28:21.492
to track down
its whereabouts, but...

28:21.494 --> 28:23.410
as soon as the sample
left my office,

28:23.412 --> 28:25.162
it's as if it simply vanished.

28:25.164 --> 28:26.547
You know what, Max?

28:26.549 --> 28:27.948
Don't even worry about it, okay?

28:27.950 --> 28:29.666
I mean, it's not
your fault.

28:29.668 --> 28:30.718
All right?

28:30.720 --> 28:32.970
Thank you for the call;
I appreciate it.

28:32.972 --> 28:35.005
Whoa. Whoa, whoa. Stop.
What?

28:35.007 --> 28:36.757
Why are you not
upset by this news?

28:36.759 --> 28:38.959
I would be upset
if I gave Max the whole sample.

28:38.961 --> 28:40.728
Oh, you stuffed a
little on the side,

28:40.730 --> 28:42.462
like, uh, for a rainy
day or something, huh?

28:42.464 --> 28:44.515
You want to beat these guys,
you got to play by their rules.

28:44.517 --> 28:45.983
I like it, I like it.

28:45.985 --> 28:47.484
There's the guy
I know and love.

28:47.486 --> 28:49.570
You like that?
Yeah, it's good.

28:49.572 --> 28:51.238
Code blue to the E.R. report.

28:55.226 --> 28:57.144
Okay, listen.

28:57.146 --> 28:58.762
There's definitely a connection
between Laura's murder

28:58.764 --> 29:00.197
and the attack
on Alan Lim.

29:00.199 --> 29:01.448
We just need
to figure out

29:01.450 --> 29:02.800
why the killer was
targeting both of them.

29:02.802 --> 29:04.134
We think this goes back
to Corey Johnson's

29:04.136 --> 29:05.469
disappearance
25 years ago.

29:05.471 --> 29:07.121
So Laura and Alan
were somehow involved

29:07.123 --> 29:08.288
with whatever
happened to him.

29:08.290 --> 29:09.423
Okay, well,
what did happen?

29:09.425 --> 29:10.424
Well, that's the thing.

29:10.426 --> 29:11.491
Nobody knows for sure,
but at the time,

29:11.493 --> 29:12.659
everyone assumed
that he drowned.

29:12.661 --> 29:14.344
Okay, well, let's say
he didn't drown.

29:14.346 --> 29:16.180
Let's say he disappeared
some other way

29:16.182 --> 29:18.098
and someone out there  a

29:18.100 --> 29:19.683
and this is
about revenge.

29:19.685 --> 29:21.268
Okay, or it could be
that Alan and Laura

29:21.270 --> 29:22.603
were simply witnesses
to what happened,

29:22.605 --> 29:24.171
and our killer tried
to silence them.

29:24.173 --> 29:26.440
Okay, but either way,
why wait 25 years?

29:26.442 --> 29:28.142
I got that case file
you asked for.

29:28.144 --> 29:29.610
Oh, thanks.

29:29.612 --> 29:33.030
I was a rookie back
then, but I remember the case.

29:33.032 --> 29:34.648
Corey Johnson was
a strong swimmer.

29:34.650 --> 29:36.183
The night he disappeared,

29:36.185 --> 29:37.284
the surf was calm--

29:37.286 --> 29:38.735
ankle slappers
at the most.

29:38.737 --> 29:40.320
Was foul play
ever suspected?

29:40.322 --> 29:42.689
There was no evidence
to support it at the time.

29:42.691 --> 29:43.907
Corey didn't have
any enemies.

29:43.909 --> 29:45.492
But I'll tell
you this:

29:45.494 --> 29:47.294
I was never convinced
the kid drowned.

29:47.296 --> 29:48.545
Hey.

29:48.547 --> 29:51.882
All right,
so it looks like witnesses

29:51.884 --> 29:53.467
spotted a vehicle
matching Alan Lim's

29:53.469 --> 29:55.636
near the beach the night
Corey Johnson disappeared.

29:55.638 --> 29:58.172
But Alan claimed that he was
at Laura's house all evening,

29:58.174 --> 29:59.339
and she backs him up.

29:59.341 --> 30:01.041
She said they were
watching a movie.

30:01.043 --> 30:02.709
So Laura was
Alan's alibi.

30:02.711 --> 30:04.678
Maybe she was lying just
to protect her boyfriend.

30:04.680 --> 30:06.230
You think they
know about Corey?

30:06.232 --> 30:07.547
I'm thinking
three people know:

30:07.549 --> 30:10.017
Alan, Laura and the person
who tried to shut them up.

30:11.153 --> 30:12.519
I got Catherine.
Catherine, go ahead.

30:12.521 --> 30:14.738
So, listen,
I've been following up

30:14.740 --> 30:17.324
on the photochemical transfer
found on Laura's hand.

30:17.326 --> 30:18.909
The GPS from her rental car

30:18.911 --> 30:21.278
indicated that she parked
at the Kaimana Mall.

30:21.280 --> 30:23.197
Turns out
that one of the 30 shops

30:23.199 --> 30:24.331
is an old-school photo store

30:24.333 --> 30:26.366
that still develops
35-millimeter film.

30:26.368 --> 30:27.701
Okay, we talk to the owner?

30:27.703 --> 30:28.785
Yeah. He said that

30:28.787 --> 30:30.737
she stopped by asking if
he could develop film

30:30.739 --> 30:32.039
that was 25 years old.

30:32.041 --> 30:33.207
They must've shaken hands.

30:33.209 --> 30:34.908
That's how she got
the chemical on her.

30:34.910 --> 30:35.926
Right.

30:35.928 --> 30:37.377
All right, so where's the film?

30:37.379 --> 30:39.096
She told the owner that
she didn't have it on her,

30:39.098 --> 30:40.264
and that she would
come back later.

30:40.266 --> 30:42.850
He kept the shop open,
but she never showed up.

30:42.852 --> 30:44.601
Whatever's on that film
got Laura killed.

30:44.603 --> 30:45.853
Okay, but we
didn't find

30:45.855 --> 30:47.054
any film on her.

30:47.056 --> 30:48.755
Killer could have taken it.

30:48.757 --> 30:50.190
Or maybe
Laura was killed

30:50.192 --> 30:52.392
before she could
get her hands on it.

30:52.394 --> 30:54.311
That's why she went
to the reunion.

30:59.701 --> 31:00.901
Everyone we
interviewed said

31:00.903 --> 31:02.336
Laura was preoccupied
at the reunion.

31:02.338 --> 31:03.904
She was asking about
all the events,

31:03.906 --> 31:05.605
but I think
there was only one

31:05.607 --> 31:08.876
she really cared about:
the opening of the time capsule.

31:17.969 --> 31:20.337
Corey had these same
rockets in his room.

31:31.099 --> 31:32.566
Thanks for doing
this, Jer.

31:32.568 --> 31:34.685
Happy I could help.

31:34.687 --> 31:37.237
Luckily for you guys,
I don't trust digital.

31:57.258 --> 31:58.175
No way.

31:58.177 --> 32:00.493
What is it?

32:03.348 --> 32:05.215
That's Laura's brother, Bradley.

32:07.435 --> 32:10.637
That photo was taken on
the night Corey disappeared.

32:12.523 --> 32:13.774
Laura lied to the police.

32:13.776 --> 32:15.726
The three of them were
with Corey that night.

32:15.728 --> 32:16.977
You really think

32:16.979 --> 32:18.312
they could be responsible
for Corey going missing?

32:18.314 --> 32:19.479
I don't know.

32:19.481 --> 32:21.148
Laura's dead,
Alan's in the hospital,

32:21.150 --> 32:23.617
so there's only one other person
who could answer that.

32:25.119 --> 32:27.421
Bradley Richmond.

32:54.294 --> 32:55.644
What's going on?

32:57.414 --> 32:58.647
Where's Bradley?

32:58.649 --> 33:01.850
I saw him walking towards
the maze a little while ago.

33:01.852 --> 33:02.885
Why?

33:20.704 --> 33:23.739
Over here!

33:28.495 --> 33:30.963
All right, I'm gonna go
out on a limb and say

33:30.965 --> 33:33.048
- that's Corey Johnson.
- Okay, so Bradley

33:33.050 --> 33:34.717
was trying to move the body,
get rid of the evidence.

33:34.719 --> 33:36.085
All right, he must've
heard us coming.

33:36.087 --> 33:37.386
He couldn't have
gotten far.

33:37.388 --> 33:39.304
Come on. He knows
where he's going, we don't.

33:39.306 --> 33:41.090
No, I got something.
I got something.

33:41.092 --> 33:43.842
Guys, we got to split up.
Come on.

33:49.816 --> 33:51.817
And on your right,
the beautiful blue waters

33:51.819 --> 33:53.435
of Kaiona Beach.

33:55.606 --> 33:56.905
Yo, what's up, bruddah?

33:56.907 --> 33:58.273
Hey. Hey, you in the air?

33:58.275 --> 34:00.776
Doing the Newlywed Special
as we speak.

34:00.778 --> 34:02.778
How fast can you get
to the Richmond Estate?

34:02.780 --> 34:04.113
Five minutes. Why?

34:04.115 --> 34:06.865
I got a perp on the move;
I could use an eye in the sky.

34:06.867 --> 34:07.916
Copy that.

34:07.918 --> 34:09.418
Hang on, lovebirds.

34:09.420 --> 34:11.870
I guess you guys got
some extra time.

34:20.463 --> 34:22.797
Bradley Richmond!

34:22.800 --> 34:25.350
Bradley!

34:25.351 --> 34:26.851
Use your head, Bradley!

34:26.853 --> 34:28.053
It's all over!

34:29.005 --> 34:31.356
Bradley,
we know you're in here!

34:31.358 --> 34:33.609
We know you killed Corey!

34:33.610 --> 34:35.777
Now come out! It's over!

34:50.161 --> 34:52.860
Hey! He's over here!

35:17.687 --> 35:20.522
McGarrett, I got a guy
in a yellow shirt

35:20.524 --> 35:21.490
moving like a mongoose.

35:21.492 --> 35:22.658
Good, good, good.

35:22.660 --> 35:23.558
Which direction?

35:24.861 --> 35:25.861
Straight.

35:25.863 --> 35:28.113
What do you mean, straight?

35:28.115 --> 35:29.615
You got an instrument panel
in front of you.

35:29.617 --> 35:31.700
Look at the compass.
Which direction?

35:31.702 --> 35:33.869
Oh, north. North.
He heading north.

35:33.871 --> 35:35.704
North.

35:35.706 --> 35:37.406
Bradley?

35:41.928 --> 35:44.012
He just changed direction.
Going west.

35:45.048 --> 35:46.181
Left.

35:49.385 --> 35:51.136
He just went through
a hole in the hedge.

35:51.138 --> 35:52.404
He's heading east.

35:55.141 --> 35:56.358
Right.

35:58.144 --> 36:00.262
Keep going. Make another right.

36:03.933 --> 36:05.400
He's coming back your way!

36:13.943 --> 36:14.443
Three...

36:14.444 --> 36:16.444
two...

36:16.446 --> 36:17.246
one.

36:19.048 --> 36:20.332
Boo-yah!

36:20.334 --> 36:22.467
Takedown,
McGarrett style!

36:23.386 --> 36:25.003
Guys, over here!

36:25.005 --> 36:26.889
I got him!

36:31.561 --> 36:33.512
You're under arrest

36:33.514 --> 36:36.231
for the murder of Corey
Johnson and Laura Richmond.

36:36.233 --> 36:39.601
I didn't kill my sister,
Alan Lim did.

36:49.245 --> 36:51.947
What the hell's this?

36:56.369 --> 36:58.036
What's going on?

36:58.038 --> 36:59.988
We recovered
Corey's body, Alan.

37:01.457 --> 37:03.992
He probably looks
a little different

37:03.994 --> 37:06.929
than when you and Bradley buried
him in the maze 25 years ago.

37:08.831 --> 37:10.832
I don't know anyone named Corey.

37:10.834 --> 37:12.384
Sure you do.

37:12.386 --> 37:14.803
Laura knew him, too.
In fact, Laura liked him.

37:14.805 --> 37:17.472
Didn't she?

37:17.474 --> 37:19.558
She liked him a lot.

37:19.560 --> 37:22.945
That's why he's dead,
isn't it, Alan?

37:22.947 --> 37:24.563
You knew that she had
a thing for Corey,

37:24.565 --> 37:26.031
but you were
too much of a coward

37:26.033 --> 37:28.233
to confront him...
by yourself.

37:28.235 --> 37:29.985
You needed Bradley
to help you.

37:29.987 --> 37:32.070
You know what?

37:33.823 --> 37:36.909
If that's where
you found the body,

37:36.911 --> 37:39.828
maybe you should go ask Bradley
how it got there.

37:41.697 --> 37:43.248
Why don't you ask him yourself.

37:58.348 --> 38:01.183
It's over.

38:01.185 --> 38:03.018
I told them everything.

38:07.657 --> 38:09.825
Why?

38:09.827 --> 38:11.693
Why would you do that?

38:11.695 --> 38:13.161
You killed Laura.

38:13.163 --> 38:14.579
That's my sister.

38:14.581 --> 38:18.233
She was going to go to the cops.

38:18.235 --> 38:21.736
I have a family.

38:21.738 --> 38:24.423
I have a life!

38:27.877 --> 38:29.511
She wanted to ruin everything.

38:29.513 --> 38:32.931
No. All she wanted to do
was tell the truth

38:32.933 --> 38:34.582
about what happened that night.

38:36.185 --> 38:38.220
She couldn't live
with the guilt anymore.

38:38.222 --> 38:43.758
We all swore that we would never
tell anyone what happened.

38:43.760 --> 38:45.260
You swore to me!

38:45.262 --> 38:47.362
We were just a bunch of kids.

38:47.364 --> 38:49.597
Alan, we were scared.

38:49.599 --> 38:51.566
We didn't want to go to jail.

39:04.213 --> 39:06.114
It was an accident.

39:11.004 --> 39:13.672
We just wanted
to teach him a lesson.

39:15.808 --> 39:18.310
Rough Corey up a little bit

39:18.312 --> 39:20.628
so that he would
stay away from Laura.

39:24.267 --> 39:26.101
But it got out of control.

39:34.477 --> 39:36.912
I slugged him.

39:40.450 --> 39:43.201
Then Corey, he-he...

39:43.203 --> 39:46.121
he fell and hit his head
on a rock.

39:50.126 --> 39:53.628
There was blood everywhere.

39:55.132 --> 39:57.499
He was... dead.

39:57.501 --> 39:59.334
And there was nothing

39:59.336 --> 40:02.220
that any of us could do
to change that.

41:04.083 --> 41:06.734
All right! Eat up.

41:06.736 --> 41:08.420
There's two more
grinz coming.

41:08.422 --> 41:09.921
Oh, what is it,
the Last Supper?

41:09.923 --> 41:12.340
What? You know how much

41:12.342 --> 41:13.741
helicopter fuel
costs, brah?

41:13.743 --> 41:16.077
You're gonna have to eat here
the rest of the month

41:16.079 --> 41:17.262
to pay off that kind of assist.

41:17.264 --> 41:19.347
Whatever happened
to being a Good Samaritan?

41:19.349 --> 41:21.516
Oh, yeah.

41:21.518 --> 41:23.218
Those guys don't have
a bottom line.

41:23.220 --> 41:24.352
Ah.

41:24.354 --> 41:26.471
Whoa, wait.
Is that...?

41:26.473 --> 41:27.806
It's our yearbook.

41:27.808 --> 41:28.923
Oh, my.

41:29.592 --> 41:31.059
Let me see Chin right now.

41:33.313 --> 41:35.147
Ah, there he is.

41:35.149 --> 41:37.616
Wow.

41:37.618 --> 41:39.151
What a goofball.

41:39.153 --> 41:40.735
What-what is that?

41:40.737 --> 41:41.870
You got the fencing team,

41:41.872 --> 41:44.072
you're in the band,
and look at this.

41:44.074 --> 41:45.790
Uh, mathletes?
Junior mathletes? It's amazing.

41:45.792 --> 41:48.376
I had a wide variety
of interests, okay?

41:48.378 --> 41:50.778
And don't forget
QB1 and captain

41:50.780 --> 41:51.997
of the football team.
All right.

41:51.999 --> 41:53.381
What about you, Jerry?

41:54.417 --> 41:57.452
Mm, there I am.

41:57.454 --> 41:59.254
Oh, yeah, buddy.
Whoo!

41:59.256 --> 42:00.939
"Most likely to be
abducted by aliens".

42:00.941 --> 42:03.058
It's not too late.

42:05.928 --> 42:07.295
You all right?

42:08.264 --> 42:10.765
"Don't ever stop
asking questions.

42:10.767 --> 42:12.984
The world needs
more people like you."

42:12.986 --> 42:15.854
Laura wrote that.

42:22.328 --> 42:23.478
You got somewhere to be?

42:23.480 --> 42:26.314
You keep checking
your watch.

42:26.316 --> 42:27.949
Yeah.

43:23.389 --> 43:25.540
You need to walk away.

43:25.542 --> 43:27.726
Who is this?

43:27.728 --> 43:29.043
Where's Sam?

43:29.045 --> 43:30.929
Agent Connors doesn't exist.

43:30.931 --> 43:33.598
The casket in Cambodia
doesn't exist.

43:33.600 --> 43:35.267
You think
making an agent disappear

43:35.269 --> 43:38.937
and cleaning up that mess
in that field is gonna stop me?
