WEBVTT

00:05.041 --> 00:06.917
SO, HOW YOU
BEEN DOING, MAN?

00:06.917 --> 00:07.708
YOU KNOW.

00:07.708 --> 00:09.625
FOR THE MOST PART,
I'M FINE.

00:09.625 --> 00:11.708
FOR THE MOST PART,

00:11.708 --> 00:14.041
WHICH I'M GOING
TO INTERPRET AS MEANING

00:14.041 --> 00:15.125
THAT EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE NOT
GOING DOWN IN FLAMES RIGHT NOW,

00:15.125 --> 00:16.291
YOU DO HAVE SOMETHING
ON YOUR MIND,

00:16.291 --> 00:18.333
SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST TELL ME
WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND?

00:18.333 --> 00:20.333
[SIGHS] NOTHING.

00:20.333 --> 00:21.291
REALLY.

00:22.417 --> 00:24.708
WHICH--I DON'T KNOW--
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,

00:24.708 --> 00:26.166
IS KIND OF THE PROBLEM.

00:27.458 --> 00:30.000
I CAN'T FIGURE OUT
WHAT THE HELL TO DO
WITH MYSELF.

00:32.792 --> 00:34.500
AND YOU'RE DEFINITELY NOT
GONNA GO BACK TO U.S.C., HUH?

00:34.500 --> 00:37.166
NO, AND THAT I KNOW
IS A RIGHT DECISION.

00:37.166 --> 00:39.667
BUT UNFORTUNATELY,
IT'S ABOUT ALL I KNOW.

00:39.667 --> 00:42.250
[BOTH LAUGH]

00:42.250 --> 00:43.458
I MEAN, COME ON, MAN.

00:43.458 --> 00:44.917
YOU GOTTA CUT YOURSELF
A LITTLE BIT OF A BREAK HERE.

00:44.917 --> 00:46.000
LIFE DID JUST THROW YOU
ONE HELL OF A CURVE BALL.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.041
ALL YOU REALLY NEED
IS TIME,

00:48.041 --> 00:49.041
BECAUSE
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT,

00:49.041 --> 00:51.208
YOU'RE GONNA BE
BACK IN THE SADDLE,

00:51.208 --> 00:52.917
FULL OF CONFIDENCE,
UP TO YOUR OLD TRICKS.

00:52.917 --> 00:54.834
AND YOU HAVE COME
TO THE RIGHT PLACE.

00:54.834 --> 00:55.917
OH, YEAH?

00:55.917 --> 00:57.250
WELL, YEAH, MAN.

00:57.250 --> 00:58.875
YOU'RE TALKING TO THE KING
OF DIRECTIONLESS HIMSELF.

00:58.875 --> 00:59.875
WHAT DO YOU THINK
I WAS DOING

00:59.875 --> 01:00.917
WITH ALL THOSE YEARS
OF HIGH SCHOOL FOLLY?

01:00.917 --> 01:04.166
I WAS PERFECTING
THE LIFE WITHOUT PURPOSE.

01:04.166 --> 01:06.000
YOU KNOW, LAST YEAR,
YOU PROBABLY COULD
HAVE GOTTEN AWAY

01:06.000 --> 01:07.583
WITH A BURST OF
SELF-DEPRECATION
LIKE THAT.

01:07.583 --> 01:09.208
BUT THIS YEAR, PACEY,
YOU SEEM FAIRLY DRIVEN.

01:09.208 --> 01:11.000
YEAH, I KNOW.
IT'S TERRIBLE, ISN'T IT?

01:11.750 --> 01:12.917
BUT WHAT CAN I SAY?

01:12.917 --> 01:14.875
I LOVE THE KITCHEN LIFE.

01:14.875 --> 01:16.542
I EVEN LOVE
THE CRASS KITCHEN ATTITUDE.

01:16.542 --> 01:16.875
SANDWICH?

01:16.875 --> 01:18.917
SURE.

01:19.667 --> 01:21.375
BUT INEVITABLY,

01:21.375 --> 01:22.792
ALONG WITH
THE CRASS KITCHEN ATTITUDE

01:22.792 --> 01:25.417
COMES THE GRILLSIDE DRAMA.

01:26.583 --> 01:28.041
OH?
YEAH.

01:28.041 --> 01:30.125
IT ALL STARTED WITH ME
TRYING TO HELP THIS GIRL

01:30.125 --> 01:32.333
OUT OF HER VERY
SELF-DESTRUCTIVE RELATIONSHIP.

01:32.333 --> 01:35.083
BUT THEN YOU THROW IN
A LITTLE DASH

01:35.083 --> 01:36.250
OF MY VERY POORLY THOUGHT OUT
ATTRACTION TO HER

01:36.250 --> 01:39.250
AND HER ABSOLUTE LACK
OF ATTRACTION TO ME.

01:39.250 --> 01:41.792
YOU KIND OF GET
WHERE I'M COMING FROM.

01:41.792 --> 01:43.500
[LAUGHS] OH, THAT SUCKS.

01:44.166 --> 01:45.333
YOU WANNA TALK ABOUT IT?

01:48.291 --> 01:49.834
NAH.

01:49.834 --> 01:51.417
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,
IT'S REALLY NOT
ALL THAT INTERESTING.

01:51.417 --> 01:54.708
AND IT'S NOTHING YOU SHOULD
BE TROUBLING YOURSELF WITH,

01:54.708 --> 01:56.333
YOU KNOW, GIVEN EVERYTHING
THAT'S BEEN ON YOUR MIND LATELY.

01:58.583 --> 02:00.792
[SIGHS]

02:01.750 --> 02:04.625
AHEM. WELL...

02:05.583 --> 02:08.458
FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,
THE PACEY I KNOW

02:08.458 --> 02:10.583
WOULD FIGURE OUT A WAY
TO HELP THE GIRL,

02:10.583 --> 02:11.625
NO MATTER
WHAT THE DRAMA.

02:11.625 --> 02:13.542
IS THAT SO?

02:13.542 --> 02:14.333
WITHOUT A DOUBT.

03:09.375 --> 03:12.625
OK. JOEY, IT'S TIME
FOR A STUDY BREAK.

03:12.625 --> 03:15.375
I'VE BEEN NODDING OFF
ON THE SAME SENTENCE
TO THE POINT OF DROOL.

03:15.375 --> 03:15.917
IT'S JUST--

03:15.917 --> 03:17.834
IT'S NOT PRETTY.

03:17.834 --> 03:19.083
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO ASK ME TWICE.

03:19.083 --> 03:20.417
AHH, SWEET.

03:22.208 --> 03:23.625
SO, WHERE'S JACK?

03:24.375 --> 03:26.333
DEEP IN
THE LAND OF FRAT.

03:26.333 --> 03:28.750
DID HE TELL YOU ABOUT
THIS WINTER FORMAL
THING?

03:28.750 --> 03:30.125
UM, YEAH.

03:30.125 --> 03:33.500
THAT ACTUALLY SOUNDS
VAGUELY FAMILIAR TO ME, BUT...

03:33.500 --> 03:36.417
TO BE QUITE HONEST, ALL
THE GREEK-SPEAK SOUNDS LIKE,

03:36.417 --> 03:38.041
WELL, GREEK TO ME.

03:38.041 --> 03:40.208
[LAUGHS] I GET IT.

03:40.208 --> 03:42.500
HE WOULDN'T THINK
OF ASKING YOU
TO THE CAVEMAN HOOPLA,

03:42.500 --> 03:44.542
SO I GET STUCK WITH
THE SURROGATE DATE
DUTIES.

03:44.542 --> 03:46.250
I FEEL FOR YOU.
I DO.

03:46.250 --> 03:49.291
WATCHING JACK
PRETEND TO BE ONE

03:49.291 --> 03:50.417
WITH THE THICK-NECKED
BROTHERHOOD.

03:50.417 --> 03:51.542
RUH RUH.

03:51.542 --> 03:53.041
COME ON, IT CAN'T
BE THAT BAD, RIGHT?

03:53.041 --> 03:56.041
WELL, I'M SURE THAT GRAMS
HAS SOME PRESCRIPTION
MEDICATION SOMEWHERE

03:56.041 --> 03:57.834
THAT WOULD HELP YOU A LOT
THROUGH THIS, JOEY.

03:57.834 --> 03:59.208
[LAUGHS]

03:59.208 --> 04:01.625
THANKS, BUT I THINK
I'LL MANAGE.

04:03.417 --> 04:05.083
HEY, JEN?

04:05.083 --> 04:05.375
UM...

04:06.375 --> 04:09.542
SPEAKING OF THE MEN
IN OUR LIVES...

04:11.333 --> 04:13.083
HOW'S DAWSON THESE DAYS?

04:15.041 --> 04:16.416
YOU'RE ASKING ME?

04:16.416 --> 04:18.250
WELL, IT'S, YOU KNOW--

04:18.250 --> 04:19.583
I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM
FOR A WHILE,

04:19.583 --> 04:22.375
AND I KNOW THAT
YOU TWO HANG OUT AND...

04:23.750 --> 04:27.000
I GUESS I JUST NEEDED
TO KNOW THAT HE'S DOING
ALL RIGHT.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.125
HE'S BETTER.

04:31.125 --> 04:34.708
HE, UM, HE'S BEEN
SEEING A SHRINK.

04:34.708 --> 04:38.291
WHICH I THINK IS REALLY
GOOD FOR HIM, YOU KNOW?

04:38.291 --> 04:39.375
HE'S GONNA BE FINE.

04:41.166 --> 04:42.542
GOOD.

04:42.542 --> 04:44.542
IT'S EXACTLY WHAT
I NEEDED TO HEAR.

04:46.000 --> 04:46.417
IT'S BEEN, UM...

04:48.917 --> 04:50.917
IT'S BEEN KIND OF HARD
GETTING USED TO NOT...

04:50.917 --> 04:54.250
BEING THE ONE TO SEE HIM
THROUGH THIS, YOU KNOW.

04:54.250 --> 04:55.125
RIGHT.

04:55.125 --> 04:56.542
I THINK
I'M FINALLY OK WITH IT,

04:56.542 --> 04:59.125
WHICH IS EVEN HARDER
TO ADMIT WITHOUT FEELING
LIKE A TOTAL JERK.

04:59.125 --> 05:01.208
OH, STOP IT, JOEY.

05:01.208 --> 05:01.542
YOU'RE NOT A JERK.

05:07.583 --> 05:08.625
WELL, ANYWAY, I'VE
BEEN MEANING TO TELL YOU

05:08.625 --> 05:10.959
THAT I CAN'T THINK
OF A BETTER PERSON

05:10.959 --> 05:12.750
TO BE THERE FOR HIM
RIGHT NOW THAN YOU.

05:14.917 --> 05:16.959
I'M REALLY GLAD THAT
YOU'RE THERE FOR HIM.

05:19.959 --> 05:22.542
THANK YOU.

05:27.750 --> 05:29.166
Polar Bear: ALL RIGHT.

05:29.166 --> 05:29.917
SIMMER DOWN, LADIES.

05:29.917 --> 05:31.959
NO OFFENSE, JACK.

05:31.959 --> 05:32.917
[ALL LAUGH]

05:32.917 --> 05:34.542
WE GOT A LOT TO DO
FOR TONIGHT'S FORMAL

05:34.542 --> 05:37.417
AND PRECIOUS LITTLE TIME
AFTER THIS MEETING.

05:37.417 --> 05:38.667
SO LET'S GET TO IT.

05:38.667 --> 05:42.500
A--THIS IS OUR BIGGEST
EVENT BEFORE THE BREAK,

05:42.500 --> 05:44.750
B--IT MUST BE PERFECT,

05:44.750 --> 05:45.792
AND C--

05:45.792 --> 05:46.959
EVERYBODY...

05:47.458 --> 05:48.250
MUST GET LAID.

05:48.250 --> 05:51.667
[CHEERING AND YELLING]

05:51.667 --> 05:54.917
YOU SHOULD ALL BE HOOKED
UP WITH A DATE BY NOW.

05:54.917 --> 05:58.041
BUT FOR THOSE OF
YOU CHUMPS WITHOUT ONE...

05:58.542 --> 05:59.083
MEET THE LIST.

05:59.083 --> 06:00.166
YEAH, THE LIST.

06:00.166 --> 06:02.166
ON THE SPIRIT
OF HOUSE LOVE,

06:02.166 --> 06:04.959
I NEED NAMES, PEOPLE.

06:04.959 --> 06:06.750
DECENT-LOOKING HONEYS

06:06.750 --> 06:08.291
READY TO PUT OUT.

06:08.291 --> 06:09.250
WHAT ABOUT DEBBIE?
HOW ABOUT
SUZANNE?

06:09.250 --> 06:12.083
[SHOUTING]

06:12.083 --> 06:13.458
WHAT ABOUT--

06:13.458 --> 06:15.208
WHAT ABOUT THOSE FINE-ASS
WORTHINGTON CHICKS?

06:15.208 --> 06:17.750
All: YEAH!

06:17.750 --> 06:18.875
COME ON, DOG,

06:18.875 --> 06:21.667
WE KNOW YOU GOT
SOME HOTTIE
FRIENDS.

06:21.667 --> 06:23.500
Polar Bear:
AND WE KNOW YOU'RE NOT
LOOKING TO SCORE WITH 'EM.

06:23.500 --> 06:26.792
[ALL LAUGH]

06:26.792 --> 06:29.708
Frat brother: TALK! TALK!
COME ON, PLEASE TALK!

06:29.708 --> 06:31.458
ALL RIGHT! ALL RIGHT!
ALL RIGHT!

06:31.458 --> 06:36.083
I MAY KNOW A GIRL THAT MEETS
THE SPECIFIED REQUIREMENTS.

06:36.875 --> 06:38.000
HEY!

06:38.000 --> 06:39.625
I GOT DIBS ON WHATEVER
THIS GUY'S GOT.

06:39.625 --> 06:41.291
OK, I'VE SEEN THESE
QUALITY CHICKS McPHEE
HANGS WITH.

06:41.291 --> 06:42.708
[LAUGHS]

06:42.708 --> 06:45.917
Polar Bear:
SO OUR MAIN MAN ERIC
HAS GOT HIMSELF A DATE.

06:45.917 --> 06:49.250
[YELLING AND CHEERING]

06:59.583 --> 07:01.250
OK. NOW, I AM AWARE

07:01.250 --> 07:02.625
OF HOW ABSURD WHAT I AM
ABOUT TO SAY IS GONNA SOUND.

07:02.625 --> 07:04.375
BUT I'M ALSO AWARE
OF HOW MISERABLE

07:04.375 --> 07:05.917
YOUR CURRENT LOVE LIFE
CAN MAKE YOU SOMETIMES.

07:05.917 --> 07:07.166
AND I CAN'T JUST SIT AROUND
THAT KITCHEN ANYMORE
AND WATCH YOU HURT,

07:07.166 --> 07:08.417
ESPECIALLY WHEN I KNOW THAT
I CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT,

07:08.417 --> 07:11.166
SO I'M HERE
TO ASK YOU OUT, KAREN.

07:12.583 --> 07:14.375
I CAN'T GO ON
A DATE WITH YOU, PACEY.

07:14.375 --> 07:15.834
OK, THAT'S FINE.

07:15.834 --> 07:18.542
THEN YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE
TO THINK OF IT AS A DATE
SO MUCH.

07:18.542 --> 07:20.583
YOU CAN THINK OF IT
AS AN OPPORTUNITY
TO COMPARE AND CONTRAST.

07:20.583 --> 07:22.625
A FREE TRIAL RUN
OF A LIFE WITHOUT HEARTACHE.

07:24.333 --> 07:26.417
PACEY, YOU KNOW I CAN'T.

07:26.417 --> 07:27.750
ACTUALLY, I KNOW
THAT YOU CAN, KAREN.

07:27.750 --> 07:30.041
BECAUSE, LOOK, YOU NEED
A BREAK FROM YOUR RELATIONSHIP.

07:30.041 --> 07:32.041
I MEAN, HELL, I NEED A BREAK
FROM YOUR RELATIONSHIP.

07:32.041 --> 07:33.542
AND I PROMISE
TO WEAR CLEAN SOCKS,

07:33.542 --> 07:35.041
LEAVE ALL THE KINKY
UNDERWEAR AT HOME.

07:35.041 --> 07:37.291
I MIGHT EVEN STOP BY C.V.S.
AND STEAL MYSELF
A BOTTLE OF COLOGNE.

07:37.291 --> 07:38.375
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY?

07:38.375 --> 07:39.333
YEAH? DO I HAVE ANY REASON
TO FEEL HOPE HERE?

07:39.333 --> 07:41.417
I MEAN,
YOU HAVE MY WORD.

07:41.417 --> 07:43.083
I'LL KEEP THIS WHOLE THING
COMPLETELY PLATONIC.

07:46.583 --> 07:47.458
FINE.

07:47.458 --> 07:48.875
A FRIENDLY OUTING
ON THE TOWN.

07:48.875 --> 07:49.917
NOTHING MORE.

07:49.917 --> 07:50.959
EXCELLENT.

07:50.959 --> 07:53.500
YOU ROCK. SO I'LL
PICK YOU UP AROUND 7:00?

07:53.500 --> 07:54.625
7:00.

07:54.625 --> 07:55.792
HA HA HA.

07:55.792 --> 07:57.417
SO THIS IS YOUR FRIEND PACEY
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT?

07:57.417 --> 07:58.458
YEAH,
BUT IT'S NOT JUST HIM.

07:58.458 --> 07:59.500
IT'S ALL MY FRIENDS.

07:59.500 --> 08:00.667
IT'S LIKE, THEY--

08:00.667 --> 08:03.375
IT'S BEEN 2 MONTHS,

08:03.375 --> 08:05.792
AND EVERYBODY'S STILL--

08:05.792 --> 08:07.792
THEY'RE HOLDING THINGS
BACK FROM ME,

08:07.792 --> 08:10.083
LIKE THEY'RE
TRYING TO PROTECT ME.

08:10.083 --> 08:12.000
I MEAN, THEY LOOK AT ME
LIKE THIS--AS THIS...

08:13.458 --> 08:17.750
FRAGILE, BREAKABLE THING
INSTEAD OF JUST DAWSON,
THE PERSON.

08:17.750 --> 08:18.959
AND I KNOW
THEY MEAN WELL.

08:18.959 --> 08:20.458
IT'S JUST...

08:20.458 --> 08:23.375
IT MAKES IT VIRTUALLY
IMPOSSIBLE TO MOVE ON.

08:23.375 --> 08:25.333
HAVE YOU MENTIONED THIS
TO ANY OF THEM?

08:25.333 --> 08:25.750
YEAH. WELL...

08:28.792 --> 08:29.875
NO,

08:29.875 --> 08:31.834
ACTUALLY.

08:31.834 --> 08:34.500
NO, I HAVEN'T
MENTIONED IT
TO THEM.

08:34.500 --> 08:37.667
WHAT ABOUT THAT FILM FESTIVAL
YOU TOLD ME ABOUT?

08:37.667 --> 08:38.750
ISN'T THAT COMING UP?

08:41.041 --> 08:43.707
THIS WEEKEND.

08:43.707 --> 08:45.333
ARE YOU GOING?

08:47.166 --> 08:48.542
HADN'T PLANNED
ON IT, NO.

08:48.542 --> 08:52.875
IT MIGHT BE GOOD
TO TAKE LIFE ON THE ROAD
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

08:52.875 --> 08:54.250
HELP CLEAR YOUR MIND.

08:54.250 --> 08:56.625
YOU COULD EVEN
TAKE ONE OF THOSE FRIENDS

08:56.625 --> 08:58.208
YOU FEEL SO ESTRANGED FROM.

08:58.208 --> 08:59.834
COME ON,

08:59.834 --> 09:02.834
THERE MUST BE
SOMEONE YOU CAN TAKE.

09:05.208 --> 09:06.542
WELL, THIS LITTLE DITTY

09:06.542 --> 09:07.375
GOES OUT TO ALL YOU
BRAVE SOULS OUT THERE

09:07.375 --> 09:09.834
SURVIVING A HEARTBREAK.

09:09.834 --> 09:11.875
TRUST ME,

09:11.875 --> 09:14.166
BETTER THINGS WILL COME.

09:20.375 --> 09:22.375
HELLO.
HEY!

09:23.708 --> 09:25.417
OH, AND DON'T WORRY,

09:25.417 --> 09:27.000
OUR DUPLICITOUS
SLEAZEBAG

09:27.000 --> 09:28.500
FORMERLY KNOWN AS
OUR BOYFRIEND CHARLIE
IS NOT HERE TODAY.

09:28.500 --> 09:29.708
AH, THAT'S
A GOOD THING.

09:29.708 --> 09:32.458
YEAH, THAT'S ALWAYS
A GOOD THING.

09:33.208 --> 09:34.875
YOU KNOW WHAT?

09:34.875 --> 09:36.417
EVEN IF
HE WERE HERE,

09:36.417 --> 09:37.291
IT WOULDN'T
REALLY MATTER TO ME.

09:37.291 --> 09:38.708
REALLY?
YEP.

09:38.708 --> 09:42.083
I THINK THAT TIME
HAS FINALLY DONE
ITS HEALING THING.

09:44.083 --> 09:44.500
HEY, WHAT'S UP?

09:44.500 --> 09:46.542
NOTHING.

09:46.542 --> 09:48.083
I JUST WISH I HAD
YOUR SELF-CONTROL.

09:48.083 --> 09:49.792
I MEAN, I KNOW
I SHOULD BE PUKING

09:49.792 --> 09:51.750
AT THE MERE MENTION
OF CHARLIE'S NAME,

09:51.750 --> 09:54.708
BUT I FIND MYSELF
DAYDREAMING ABOUT HIM.

09:54.708 --> 09:56.333
HIS LATEST ATTEMPT
TO WOO US BACK

09:56.333 --> 09:58.625
WITH THAT WHOLE
"I'VE CHANGED" PITCH.

09:59.750 --> 10:03.583
UH, WAIT. WHICH
"I'VE CHANGED" PITCH?

10:03.583 --> 10:04.542
YOU KNOW, ALL THOSE
CORNY LOVE LETTERS
HE KEEPS SENDING.

10:04.542 --> 10:05.875
DOESN'T IT SEEM
SOMETIMES,

10:05.875 --> 10:09.875
YOU KNOW, IN THAT MOMENT
YOU CRAWL INTO BED ALONE,

10:09.875 --> 10:11.917

HE REALLY DID CHANGE"?

10:13.708 --> 10:15.250
[SIGHS]

10:15.250 --> 10:15.750
GOSH.

10:17.917 --> 10:21.041
I DON'T KNOW WHICH
LOVE LETTERS YOU MEAN.

10:22.125 --> 10:23.458
OH.

10:25.041 --> 10:27.125
HASN'T HE BEEN
SENDING YOU LETTERS?

10:27.125 --> 10:28.875

10:28.875 --> 10:30.875
OH.

10:33.625 --> 10:35.500
SO HE'S TRYING TO
WOO YOU BACK WITH LOVE
LETTERS, HUH? THAT'S--

10:35.500 --> 10:36.625
JEN, I'M SO SORRY.

10:36.625 --> 10:37.625
ARE YOU OK?

10:37.625 --> 10:38.542
NO, NO, NO.

10:38.542 --> 10:40.458
PLEASE.
PLEASE DON'T APOLOGIZE.

10:40.458 --> 10:42.125
I SWEAR IT'S FINE.

10:42.125 --> 10:44.750
I WAS JUST SAYING
TO YOU THAT IT
DOESN'T MATTER TO ME.

10:47.166 --> 10:47.750
I WANT
CORNY LOVE LETTERS.

10:51.375 --> 10:54.750
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY HE CHOSE HER
AND NOT ME.

10:57.125 --> 10:58.375
IS THERE SOMETHING
WRONG WITH ME?

10:58.375 --> 10:59.500
JEN,

10:59.500 --> 11:02.291
THERE'S NOTHING
WRONG WITH YOU.

11:02.291 --> 11:04.458
IT'S JUST--
ALL THIS TIME,

11:04.458 --> 11:05.542
I THOUGHT HE WAS
CHEATING ON US

11:05.542 --> 11:06.458
ON EQUAL GROUND,
YOU KNOW?

11:06.458 --> 11:08.500
BUT, NO, SHE GOT
TO BE THE GIRLFRIEND

11:08.500 --> 11:11.333
AND I WAS JUST THE...

11:11.333 --> 11:12.542
FLOOZIE.

11:13.792 --> 11:15.125
THE FLOOZIE?

11:17.041 --> 11:18.000
YEAH.

11:18.000 --> 11:18.750

THE FLOOZIE?

11:18.750 --> 11:20.500
[LAUGHING]
IT'S WHAT I AM.

11:20.500 --> 11:22.250
A FLOOZIE.

11:22.250 --> 11:23.834
OH, JEN.

11:26.917 --> 11:30.291
THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE
THE OTHER WAY AROUND.

11:30.291 --> 11:32.250
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE
CONSOLING YOU,
YOU KNOW.

11:32.250 --> 11:33.917
NO, PLEASE.

11:33.917 --> 11:34.875
IT'S THE LEAST I CAN DO.

11:34.875 --> 11:37.041
AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
IT'S HELPING ME.

11:37.041 --> 11:38.583
A LOT.

11:41.500 --> 11:42.500
I JUST DON'T
WANNA BE HERE.

11:42.500 --> 11:44.708
THE THOUGHT OF RUNNING
INTO EITHER OF THEM

11:44.708 --> 11:46.542
MAKES ME WANNA PUKE.

11:48.083 --> 11:49.333
OK, SO LET'S
GET OUT OF HERE, THEN.

11:49.333 --> 11:51.000
THIS WEEKEND.

11:52.375 --> 11:55.375
WELL, I'M GAME.

11:55.375 --> 11:56.583

DO YOU WANNA GO?

TO HOOKSETT, NEW HAMPSHIRE?

TELL YOU SOMETHING?
I AM SO PSYCHED

12:11.917 --> 12:13.625
TO BE GOING
TO THIS FORMAL THING.

12:13.625 --> 12:14.875
I WAS SO EXCITED
WHEN JACK CALLED.

12:14.875 --> 12:16.000
OK, GRANTED,

12:16.000 --> 12:17.500
LAST-MINUTE ARRANGEMENTS
CAN BE KIND OF ANNOYING,

12:17.500 --> 12:20.208
NOT TO MENTION BLIND DATES
CAN BE AS DANGEROUS
AS GATOR WRESTLING.

12:20.208 --> 12:20.959

12:20.959 --> 12:22.542
YOU'RE HOGGING
THE MIRROR.

HELLO, HIDEOUS.

12:28.208 --> 12:30.083
DO I EVEN LIKE
ANY OF MY CLOTHES?

12:30.083 --> 12:31.458
AUDREY, YOU LOOK GREAT.

12:31.458 --> 12:33.667
BESIDES, I REALLY DON'T
KNOW WHAT THE BIG DEAL
IS.

12:33.667 --> 12:35.208
I MEAN AS MUCH AS I WANT
TO GIVE JACK CREDIT,

12:35.208 --> 12:37.583
I'M SURE IT'S
JUST ANOTHER NIGHT
OF FRAT DEBAUCHERY

12:37.583 --> 12:39.000
MASQUERADING
AS AN EVENT.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.625
OK, KILLJOY.

12:40.625 --> 12:43.792
FIRST OFF, JACK SAID
THIS ERIC GUY
IS HELLA'CUTE,

12:43.792 --> 12:46.083
WHICH RIGHT OFF, SOUNDS
PRETTY INTERESTING TO ME.

12:46.083 --> 12:47.083
AND SECONDLY,

12:47.083 --> 12:48.542
FOR SOMEONE AS
PROGRESSIVE AS YOU,

12:48.542 --> 12:51.667
IT'S AMAZING
HOW CLOSED-MINDED
YOU ARE ABOUT FRATS.

12:51.667 --> 12:52.750
THE WORDS
"PROGRESSIVE" AND "FRAT"

12:52.750 --> 12:54.917
DO NOT BELONG TOGETHER
IN THE SAME SENTENCE.

12:54.917 --> 12:56.208
WHAT ABOUT THIS ONE?

12:58.834 --> 12:59.917
JOEY,

12:59.917 --> 13:02.583
WE'RE GOING
ON A DOUBLE DATE.

13:02.583 --> 13:04.000
A LITTLE CHEER, PLEASE.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.959
OK, OK.

13:05.959 --> 13:07.375
WELL, IF NOTHING ELSE,

13:07.375 --> 13:09.125
AT LEAST
I'LL HAVE A GOOD TIME
WITH JACK, RIGHT?

YOU'LL HAVE TO DO.

WHAT THE BIG DEAL
IS, THOUGH.

KIND OF RETARDED.

MAKE THIS CLEAR.

IT IS MORE
THAN AN OPTION

TO TURN AROUND
AND GO BACK HOME
RIGHT NOW.

THAT WE COULD
BOTH USE THE LOVE?

AND WHAT BETTER WAY
TO SPEND AN EVENING

14:53.667 --> 14:57.208
THAN AS GIRLFRIEND
TO THE BIGGEST
CELEBRITY IN TOWN?

HAVE A FACE.

WITH FANTASTIC
TASTE IN CLOTHING,

19:18.750 --> 19:21.291
AND ALTHOUGH
YOUR JOKES
DO TEND TO BOMB,

19:21.291 --> 19:26.291
YOU MAKE UP FOR IT
WITH THAT SPARKLING
SMILE OF YOURS.

19:26.291 --> 19:28.667
OK. NOW, IT'S YOUR TURN.

19:28.667 --> 19:32.000
I HAD A GREAT TIME
TONIGHT, PACEY.

19:32.000 --> 19:35.667
YEAH, I'LL TAKE THAT.

19:35.667 --> 19:37.417
THANK YOU.

19:37.417 --> 19:42.583
YOU KNOW, JUST SEEING
YOU HAVE A GOOD TIME
IS THANKS ENOUGH.

19:46.834 --> 19:48.875
ANYWAY, UH...

19:48.875 --> 19:51.417
GOOD NIGHT, KAREN.

20:42.875 --> 20:44.959
THE FIRST TIME
I SAW THIS DOCUMENTARY,

20:44.959 --> 20:46.125
I KNEW
I WAS IN THE HANDS

20:46.125 --> 20:47.875
OF A TALENTED FILMMAKER,

20:47.875 --> 20:51.041
BUT I WAS EQUALLY
MOVED BY A LETTER

20:51.041 --> 20:52.792
WHICH ACCOMPANIED
THE FILM'S SUBMISSION.

20:52.792 --> 20:54.959
IT WAS A LETTER FROM
THE FILMMAKER'S FATHER

20:54.959 --> 20:57.583
TELLING ME
THAT I ABSOLUTELY

20:57.583 --> 20:59.000
COULD NOT IGNORE
HIS SON'S WORK.

20:59.000 --> 21:03.208
HONESTLY, I WAS
PREDISPOSED TO HATE
THE FILM BECAUSE, WELL,

21:03.208 --> 21:06.959
IT DIDN'T SHOW UP
UNTIL 3 DAYS PASSED
THE DEADLINE.

21:06.959 --> 21:08.583
BUT I'M
A FATHER MYSELF,

21:08.583 --> 21:12.625
AND I KNOW A THING OR TWO
ABOUT PARENTAL PRIDE.

21:12.625 --> 21:17.917
SO I GRUDGINGLY PUT
THE VIDEO IN THE VCR.

21:17.917 --> 21:21.542
AND AFTER 5 MINUTES,
I KNEW MITCH LEERY WAS RIGHT.

21:21.542 --> 21:27.083
I ABSOLUTELY
COULD NOT IGNORE
HIS SON'S WORK.

21:27.083 --> 21:29.750
SO, LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN,

21:29.750 --> 21:34.291
I GIVE YOU THE FILMMAKER
BEHIND THIS YEAR'S
TOP PRIZE FILM...

21:34.291 --> 21:37.250
DAWSON LEERY.

21:59.625 --> 22:00.834
UH...

22:02.250 --> 22:06.333
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

22:11.125 --> 22:12.500
MY DAD...

22:15.500 --> 22:17.834
LOVED MOVIES.

22:18.792 --> 22:22.959
HE LOVED THEM, UH,
IN THE TRUEST SENSE

22:22.959 --> 22:24.667
IN THAT
HE HAD NO INTEREST
IN MAKING THEM.

22:24.667 --> 22:26.333
HE JUST...

22:26.333 --> 22:28.375
HE LOVED WATCHING THEM.

22:29.625 --> 22:34.333
HE STARTED
TAKING ME TO MOVIES
AT A VERY EARLY AGE.

22:34.333 --> 22:36.458
I LOVED IT. HE WOULD
TAKE ME TO MOVIES
AND THEN, UH...

22:36.458 --> 22:38.208
AND THEN TALK TO ME
ABOUT THEM.

22:38.208 --> 22:41.417
AND THANK GOD
HE DID.

22:41.417 --> 22:44.041
UM, 'CAUSE
THERE'S NO WAY I
WOULD BE HERE RIGHT NOW

22:44.041 --> 22:46.500
IF HE HADN'T DONE THAT.

22:46.500 --> 22:52.834
UM, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR THIS AWARD

22:52.834 --> 22:55.291
AND FOR RECEIVING
THIS FILM SO WARMLY.

22:56.208 --> 23:00.291
I DEDICATE THIS FILM
TO MY DAD,

23:00.291 --> 23:03.708
AND I WILL REMEMBER HIM

23:03.708 --> 23:07.250
EVERY TIME I LOOK AT THIS.

23:08.208 --> 23:09.667
SO, THANK YOU.

23:16.208 --> 23:17.375
AND A VERY SPECIAL
THANK YOU

23:17.375 --> 23:21.542
TO MY GIRLFRIEND
JEN LINDLEY.

23:34.291 --> 23:35.875
Eric: I'M--
I'M NOT SAYING THAT
I BENCH THAT MUCH

23:35.875 --> 23:38.333
YET.

23:38.333 --> 23:42.750
BUT I MEAN,
SOME OF THE GUYS,
THEY DO. IT'S CRAZY.

23:44.417 --> 23:47.041
SO, UM, WHAT GYM
DO YOU GO TO?

23:47.041 --> 23:50.792
[SOMEONE SCREAMS]

23:56.500 --> 23:56.917
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

23:56.917 --> 23:59.375
NOTHING.

24:02.166 --> 24:04.959
YOU WANT
ANOTHER DRINK?

24:12.291 --> 24:15.000
HEY! McPHEE!

24:15.000 --> 24:16.708
I'M BEGINNING
TO THINK YOU
LIED TO ME, MAN.

24:16.708 --> 24:18.291
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

24:18.291 --> 24:19.750
AUDREY.

24:19.750 --> 24:23.667
THIS CHICK,
SHE'S ALL TEASE
AND NO PLEASE.

24:23.667 --> 24:26.375
COME ON.
IT'S ONLY HALFWAY
THROUGH THE NIGHT.

24:26.375 --> 24:28.041
I MEAN,
GIVE HER SOME TIME.
SHE'LL COME AROUND.

24:28.041 --> 24:29.291
GOD, I DON'T KNOW,
MAN. IT'S LIKE

24:29.291 --> 24:32.792
I GAVE HER MY BEST
MOVES AND MY BEST
LINES, AND IT...

24:32.792 --> 24:33.959
ZZZ! NOTHING!

24:33.959 --> 24:36.708
WHAT IF SHE TURNS
OUT TO BE A PRUDE?

24:36.708 --> 24:41.166
WHAT? NO, NO. BELIEVE ME.
LOOK, THE LAST THING
AUDREY IS IS A PRUDE.

24:41.166 --> 24:43.458
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE SO WORRIED
ABOUT, MAN.

24:43.458 --> 24:46.834
I MEAN, AUDREY'S
EASY, ALL RIGHT.

24:46.834 --> 24:48.542
SHE'S JUST LOOKING
TO HAVE A GOOD TIME.

24:48.542 --> 24:49.625
I KNOW FOR A FACT
THAT SHE WAS PSYCHED
TO COME HERE TONIGHT.

24:49.625 --> 24:52.917
YOU JUST, YOU KNOW,
PLAY YOUR CARDS RIGHT

24:52.917 --> 24:56.041
AND SHE'LL HOOK UP
WITH YOU FOR SURE.

25:17.500 --> 25:20.667
LOOK, I KNOW THAT
THIS IS COMPLICATED.

25:20.667 --> 25:25.291
AND DESPITE WHAT
WERE MY BEST INTENTIONS,

25:25.291 --> 25:27.125
I PROMISE YOU I KNOW
THAT I HAVEN'T HELPED,

25:27.125 --> 25:29.542
BUT THERE'S NO REASON
WHY WE CAN'T WORK
THIS OUT.

25:29.542 --> 25:33.875
THIS DOESN'T CHANGE
ANYTHING, PACEY.

25:33.875 --> 25:35.291
THIS DOESN'T MEAN
THAT WE'RE IN
A RELATIONSHIP.

25:35.291 --> 25:39.208
WELL, I KNOW THAT WE'RE
NOT HAVING A RELATIONSHIP,
BUT NOW--

25:39.208 --> 25:41.333
THEN WHY THE HELL
DID YOU START THIS
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

25:41.333 --> 25:43.625
HOLD ON A SECOND HERE.
YOU KISSED ME. REMEMBER?

25:43.625 --> 25:45.875
THAT WAS
A MISTAKE. OK?

25:45.875 --> 25:47.208
YOU'RE NOT WORTH
WHAT I'M RISKING.

25:50.041 --> 25:51.792
SO, THEN
WHY DID YOU DO IT?

25:54.708 --> 25:56.667
I DON'T KNOW.

26:02.250 --> 26:05.417
DID YOU SLEEP WITH ME
TO GET BACK AT BRECHER?

26:08.458 --> 26:10.792
YOU DID, DIDN'T YOU?

26:13.208 --> 26:14.417
IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.

26:14.417 --> 26:16.834
NO, IT IS THAT SIMPLE.

26:18.959 --> 26:20.208
Photographer: OK.
LET'S SQUEEZE IN
ON THE SIDES.

26:20.208 --> 26:23.667
GOOD. HOLD IT.

26:23.667 --> 26:27.208
OK. THANKS A LOT,
GUYS. APPRECIATE IT.

26:29.750 --> 26:32.041
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE
REALLY PISSING ME
OFF, LEERY.

26:32.041 --> 26:33.708
I MEAN, I USED
TO TAKE PRIDE
IN THINKING

26:33.708 --> 26:36.041
THAT I WAS
THE ONLY GEEK
IN AMERICA

26:36.041 --> 26:37.583
THAT KNEW WHO
A.I. BROOKS WAS.

26:37.583 --> 26:41.792
SERIOUSLY, THOUGH,
MAN, YOUR FLICK
IS FANTASTIC.

26:41.792 --> 26:42.250
I'M BLOWN AWAY.

26:42.250 --> 26:44.417
THANK YOU.

26:44.417 --> 26:47.125
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE
NOT HALF THE GOON
I THOUGHT YOU WERE.

26:47.125 --> 26:49.417
I'M NOT A, UH,
HOLLYWOOD SLICKSTER?

26:49.417 --> 26:52.708
OK. OK. I CAN GET
A LITTLE CARRIED
AWAY SOMETIMES.

26:52.708 --> 26:57.083
SO? HOW DO
YOU LIKE 'SC?

26:57.083 --> 27:00.542
UH, DROPPED OUT,
ACTUALLY.

27:00.542 --> 27:02.375
UM, IT JUST
WASN'T FOR ME.

27:02.375 --> 27:03.583
WHAT ABOUT YOU?
YOUR MOVIE IS WORTHY
OF GREAT STUFF.

27:03.583 --> 27:06.667
WHY ARE YOU
HANGING AROUND HERE?

27:06.667 --> 27:07.583
WELL, HERE IS
WHERE I GREW UP.

27:07.583 --> 27:09.792
I GO TO SCHOOL
IN BOSTON.

27:09.792 --> 27:11.625
THIS REALLY WEIRD
VISUAL ARTS PLACE

27:11.625 --> 27:14.375
FULL OF FREAKS
AND MISFITS.

27:14.375 --> 27:15.834
AND YOU KNOW,
IT MIGHT SUIT YOU.

27:15.834 --> 27:20.417
YEAH, YOU SHOULD,
UH, COME CHECK
IT OUT SOMETIME.

27:20.417 --> 27:22.500
DEFINITELY.

27:22.500 --> 27:24.291
THANK YOU. I MIGHT.

27:24.291 --> 27:25.625
COOL.

27:25.625 --> 27:28.417
AH, HERE COMES
YOUR GIRL.

27:28.417 --> 27:30.208
SHE'S, UH...

27:47.542 --> 27:48.792
HI.

27:48.792 --> 27:51.500
HEY.

27:51.500 --> 27:53.000
JEN, THIS IS OLIVER.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.917
OH. YEAH. GOD.
YOUR MOVIE WAS FANTASTIC.

27:55.917 --> 27:57.208
THANKS.

27:57.208 --> 27:59.250
UM, AND YOU'RE
STILL REALLY PRETTY.

27:59.250 --> 28:00.542
THANK YOU.

28:00.542 --> 28:03.000
I WAS JUST ABOUT
TO TELL DAWSON
HOW LUCKY HE IS.

28:03.000 --> 28:05.792
YOU GUYS MAKE
A GREAT COUPLE.

28:05.792 --> 28:07.458
WELL, THANK YOU.
VERY MUCH.

28:07.458 --> 28:10.333
NO PROBLEM.
UM, I'LL SEE
YOU AROUND?

28:10.333 --> 28:12.792
YEAH. SEE YA.

28:15.500 --> 28:17.625
[JEN LAUGHS]

28:17.625 --> 28:19.667
DID YOU
HEAR THAT, BABY?

28:19.667 --> 28:21.166
YOU'RE LUCKY
TO HAVE ME.

28:21.166 --> 28:22.834
THAT'S AN UNDERSTATEMENT
IF I EVER HEARD ONE.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.250
WHAT?

28:31.250 --> 28:33.041
HOW DO YOU GET OFF
TALKING ABOUT AUDREY
LIKE THAT?

28:33.041 --> 28:34.875
YOU YOURSELF
USED TO TALK ABOUT
HER LIKE THAT.

28:34.875 --> 28:36.333
YEAH, BUT THAT'S
BEFORE I KNEW HER.

28:36.333 --> 28:38.625
I WASN'T GOING
AROUND SELLING HER
TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER.

28:38.625 --> 28:41.041
IT WAS JUST STUPID,
HARMLESS FUN.
THAT'S IT.

28:41.041 --> 28:43.041
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU JUST SAID THAT.

28:43.041 --> 28:45.291
JACK, WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOU?

28:45.291 --> 28:46.959
WHEN DID YOU
TURN INTO THIS JERK?

28:46.959 --> 28:49.834
HOLD ON. YOU
DON'T UNDERSTAND.

28:49.834 --> 28:51.417
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND,

28:51.417 --> 28:53.041
AND THAT'S BECAUSE YOU
NEVER CARED TO EXPLAIN.

28:53.041 --> 28:54.375
IT'S LIKE
YOU JUST COULDN'T WAIT

28:54.375 --> 28:55.375
FOR THE MOMENT
WE GOT TO BOSTON

28:55.375 --> 28:56.708
SO YOU COULD DROP US
AND GET NEW FRIENDS.

28:56.708 --> 28:59.208
WHOA--WHOA.
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

28:59.208 --> 29:01.208
NO?

29:01.208 --> 29:02.208
LOOK.

29:02.208 --> 29:04.500
WHAT?

29:04.500 --> 29:06.208
I FEEL AT HOME HERE.

29:06.208 --> 29:08.000
FOR ONCE,
I HAVE A FAMILY

29:08.000 --> 29:09.750
THAT'S NOT CONSTANTLY
ON THE BRINK

29:09.750 --> 29:11.125
OF SELF-DESTRUCTION.

29:11.125 --> 29:12.166
I MEAN,
WITH THESE GUYS,

29:12.166 --> 29:13.417
I CAN FINALLY
LIVE MY LIFE

29:13.417 --> 29:15.959
INSTEAD OF CONSTANTLY
WORRYING ABOUT
SOMEONE ELSE'S.

29:15.959 --> 29:17.166
REALLY?

29:17.166 --> 29:18.834
BECAUSE IT FEELS
TO ME LIKE YOU'RE
HIDING, JACK,

29:18.834 --> 29:20.250
LIKE YOU'RE
PUSHING US
AND YOURSELF AWAY,

29:20.250 --> 29:21.583
BECAUSE MAYBE
IT'S JUST EASIER

29:21.583 --> 29:22.083
TO BE ANOTHER ONE
OF THE MEATHEADS.

29:24.333 --> 29:26.333
MEATHEAD?
YEAH.

29:26.333 --> 29:27.750
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
ANY OF THESE PEOPLE.

29:27.750 --> 29:29.583
WELL, I REALLY DON'T
WANT TO RUN OFF
AND MEET 'EM ALL

29:29.583 --> 29:32.250
NOW THAT I KNOW
THEY'RE ALL
WANNA-BE PIMPS.

29:32.250 --> 29:33.291
SEE, NOW YOU'RE
EXAGGERATING, JOEY.

29:33.291 --> 29:35.208
YOU KNOW WHAT? EVERY
TIME SOMETHING DOESN'T

29:35.208 --> 29:37.041
MEET YOUR STANDARD
OF RIGHTEOUSNESS,

29:37.041 --> 29:37.792
YOU WRITE IT OFF
LIKE IT'S THE WORST
THING ON EARTH.

29:37.792 --> 29:40.000
STANDARD OF
RIGHTEOUSNESS?

29:40.000 --> 29:41.208
YEAH.

29:41.208 --> 29:43.875
JACK, TRY COMMON
DECENCY AND RESPECT.

29:43.875 --> 29:45.625
JOEY, LOOK AROUND.

29:45.625 --> 29:47.125
EVERYBODY HERE
IS HAVING A GOOD TIME.

29:47.125 --> 29:49.458
NOBODY'S FORCING
ANYONE TO BE HERE.

29:54.458 --> 29:58.125
THAT'S TRUE.

29:58.125 --> 30:00.875
NO ONE'S FORCING
ME TO BE HERE.

30:16.625 --> 30:18.291
WHAT ARE YOU
THINKING ABOUT?

30:18.291 --> 30:20.250
MY DAD.

30:20.250 --> 30:22.458
IN A GOOD WAY.
IN A REALLY GOOD WAY.

30:22.458 --> 30:24.542
IN A WAY I HAVEN'T
BEEN ABLE TO
IN A LONG TIME.

30:24.542 --> 30:25.875
STANDING UP THERE
IN FRONT OF ALL
THOSE PEOPLE,

30:25.875 --> 30:28.542
TALKING ABOUT HIM,
IT WAS JUST...

30:28.542 --> 30:31.708
IT WAS SO NICE

30:31.708 --> 30:33.125
TO REMEMBER HIM.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.792
YOU KNOW, AND
FOR THE FIRST TIME,

30:36.792 --> 30:38.875
I WAS FINALLY
ABLE TO APPRECIATE

30:38.875 --> 30:40.041
WHAT A GREAT FATHER
HE WAS

30:40.041 --> 30:42.375
AND HOW LUCKY I WAS
TO HAVE KNOWN HIM

30:42.375 --> 30:43.333
WITHOUT FEELING GUILTY.

30:43.333 --> 30:48.166
WITHOUT FEELING
LIKE I LET HIM DOWN.

30:48.166 --> 30:52.166
I DON'T WANNA
JINX ANYTHING, BUT...

30:52.166 --> 30:53.917
I DARESAY I'M HAPPY.

30:53.917 --> 30:55.625
WELL, I HOPE SO

30:55.625 --> 30:58.333
'CAUSE YOU DESERVE IT.

30:58.333 --> 31:01.083
AND I HAVE YOU
TO THANK IN A BIG WAY.

31:01.083 --> 31:02.250
HOW DO YOU FIGURE?

31:02.250 --> 31:03.667
YOU'VE SOMEHOW MANAGED
TO FIGURE OUT A WAY

31:03.667 --> 31:05.125
TO BE THERE FOR ME.

31:05.125 --> 31:06.625
AND THAT...

31:06.625 --> 31:08.834
UH...I'LL NEVER BE ABLE

31:08.834 --> 31:10.333
TO PUT INTO WORDS
WHAT THAT MEANS TO ME.

31:10.333 --> 31:12.875
LISTEN. I...

31:12.875 --> 31:16.417
IT'S THE LEAST
I CAN DO FOR THE GUY

31:16.417 --> 31:19.041
WHO RESTORES MY FAITH
IN THE OPPOSITE SEX.

31:19.041 --> 31:19.458
[LAUGHS]

31:19.458 --> 31:21.625
I DO THAT?

31:21.625 --> 31:23.083
YES, YOU DO DO THAT.

31:23.083 --> 31:26.041
WOW. HOW DO I DO THAT?

31:26.041 --> 31:29.208
BECAUSE...EH, UM...

31:29.208 --> 31:34.166
NO. WHEN IT DIDN'T
WORK OUT BETWEEN US
ALL THOSE YEARS AGO,

31:34.166 --> 31:35.667
UM...

31:35.667 --> 31:39.917
YOU STILL HAVE MANAGED
TO GIVE ME A PLACE
IN YOUR HEART.

31:39.917 --> 31:41.875
WHY DIDN'T IT WORK OUT
BETWEEN US?

31:42.708 --> 31:45.375
YOU WERE IN LOVE
WITH JOEY.

31:45.375 --> 31:46.625
NO. THAT'S TOO EASY.

31:46.625 --> 31:47.708
I SEEM TO RECALL YOU
HAVING BROKEN UP WITH ME.

31:47.708 --> 31:51.041
YEAH, BUT, I--

31:51.041 --> 31:52.458
OH, GOD.

31:52.458 --> 31:54.083
I QUICKLY SAW
THE ERRORS OF MY WAYS

31:54.083 --> 31:59.625
AND PROCEEDED TO, UM...
HURL MYSELF AT YOU

31:59.625 --> 32:02.083
IN A VERY
EMBARRASSING FASHION.

32:02.083 --> 32:02.542
THAT'S RIGHT. YOU DID.

32:02.542 --> 32:04.708
OH, GOD.

32:04.708 --> 32:06.750
AND I'M ASHAMED TO ADMIT IT,
BUT I REALLY ENJOYED THAT.

32:06.750 --> 32:09.458
I DID. I LOVED IT,

32:09.458 --> 32:13.333
ESPECIALLY YOU BEING
THE FIRST GIRL THAT HAD
TORN MY HEART OUT AND ALL.

32:13.333 --> 32:14.291
I DID?
GOD, YEAH.

32:14.291 --> 32:15.583
TEMPLE OF DOOM  STYLE.

32:15.583 --> 32:18.542
BUT...

32:18.542 --> 32:21.125
ANYWAY...

32:21.125 --> 32:24.750
I THINK I'M FULLY AWARE
OF THE REASON IT DIDN'T
WORK OUT BETWEEN US.

32:24.750 --> 32:25.750
WHY?

32:25.750 --> 32:27.500
YOU WERE NEVER
PHYSICALLY ATTRACTED TO ME.

32:29.500 --> 32:31.166
IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK?

32:31.166 --> 32:33.792
YEAH. I THINK YOU THOUGHT
THAT I WAS SAFE.

33:38.750 --> 33:41.333
LOOK AT YOU SMILING.

33:41.333 --> 33:45.959
SO THAT'S
WHAT EVERYONE'S
TALKING ABOUT.

33:45.959 --> 33:46.583
THAT'S IT.

33:46.583 --> 33:49.125
HMM...

33:50.750 --> 33:52.125
IT WASN'T...

33:52.125 --> 33:53.667
WHAT I IMAGINED.

33:54.792 --> 33:56.041
IT'S NOT?

33:56.041 --> 33:58.250
NO. EVERYONE ALWAYS
TOLD ME YOUR FIRST TIME

33:58.250 --> 34:00.750
IS NEVER AS GOOD AS
YOU'D IMAGINE IT TO BE.

34:00.750 --> 34:03.667
THAT WAS...

34:03.667 --> 34:04.834
EVERY BIT
THE FANTASY.

34:04.834 --> 34:07.708
UH, YOU WERE--

34:07.708 --> 34:08.833
SHH!

34:08.833 --> 34:10.291
WE.

34:10.291 --> 34:12.792
WE  WERE.

34:18.542 --> 34:19.500
YOU'RE RIGHT.

34:23.166 --> 34:23.333
WE.

34:25.333 --> 34:27.125
WE WERE GREAT.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.083
WHAT'S WRONG, WITTER?
YOU'RE EARLY.

34:46.083 --> 34:48.208
I NEED TO TALK
TO YOU FOR A SEC.

34:50.291 --> 34:51.792
ALL RIGHT. WHAT'S UP?

34:51.792 --> 34:53.208
I QUIT.

34:53.208 --> 34:55.375
THIS IS ABOUT KAREN?

34:57.417 --> 34:59.333
YES, THIS IS ABOUT KAREN.

34:59.333 --> 35:02.458
SO YOU KNOW
THINGS HAVE GOTTEN
A LITTLE COMPLICATED,

35:02.458 --> 35:03.917
AND I'M SORRY
BECAUSE I DIDN'T MEAN
FOR THIS TO HAPPEN.

35:03.917 --> 35:06.834
YEAH, YOU DID.
THERE'S NO NEED
TO LIE TO ME ABOUT IT.

35:06.834 --> 35:10.166
YOU'RE SAYING THAT TO ME,
THE GUY WHO'S CHEATING
ON HIS WIFE,

35:10.166 --> 35:11.208
AND YOU PUT ME
RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF IT.

35:11.208 --> 35:13.458
DO YOU EVER STOP
TO THINK ABOUT THAT,

35:13.458 --> 35:15.208
OR DID YOU EVER STOP
TO THINK ABOUT KAREN?

35:15.208 --> 35:17.625
MORE THAN YOU'LL
EVER KNOW, KID.

35:19.291 --> 35:21.333
FINE. WHATEVER.
I STILL QUIT.

35:21.333 --> 35:23.583
FINE. THAT'S COOL.
KAREN ALREADY
BEAT YOU TO IT.

35:24.583 --> 35:26.500
WHAT?

35:26.500 --> 35:29.500
THAT'S WHAT SHE WANTED,
NOT ME.

35:29.500 --> 35:32.333
LOOK, I'M SORRY YOU
GOT CAUGHT UP IN THIS.

35:32.333 --> 35:34.667
I SHOULD PROBABLY NEVER
HAVE BORROWED YOUR BOAT.

35:34.667 --> 35:38.875
I'M SORRY
THAT YOUR IMAGE OF ME
HAS BEEN SHATTERED.

35:38.875 --> 35:40.000
I NEVER SAID
I WAS PERFECT.

35:40.000 --> 35:44.375
THAT'S THE WAY
THINGS ARE SOMETIMES.

35:44.375 --> 35:46.417
JOB'S STILL YOURS
IF YOU WANT IT.

36:05.125 --> 36:07.125
IS EVERYTHING OK?

36:07.125 --> 36:08.583
YES.

36:08.583 --> 36:12.208
I WAS JUST PUTTING JACK
THROUGH A PRETTY GRUELING
APOLOGY HERE,

36:12.208 --> 36:15.375
BUT HE PASSED.

36:15.375 --> 36:17.083
COME HERE, YOU!

36:17.083 --> 36:18.458
I'M SO SORRY.

36:18.458 --> 36:19.083
I KNOW. I KNOW.

36:19.083 --> 36:21.166
NO HARD FEELINGS, OK?

36:21.166 --> 36:23.583
JUST A LOT
OF MAKING UP TO DO.

36:23.583 --> 36:25.875
AND THE NEXT TIME
YOU SET ME UP,

36:25.875 --> 36:28.166
IT BETTER BE WITH SOMEONE
SECURE ENOUGH WITH GIRLS

36:28.166 --> 36:30.667
NOT TO RESORT TO, LIKE,
MUSCLE-AND-FITNESS TALK.

36:30.667 --> 36:32.000
REALLY,
WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?

36:33.041 --> 36:35.917
GO EASY ON HIM, BUNNY.

36:45.291 --> 36:46.667
[SIGHS]

36:46.667 --> 36:48.375
OK, UH...

36:48.375 --> 36:51.125
THE THING IS, JOEY, UM...

36:51.125 --> 36:53.125
THERE REALLY
ISN'T MUCH I CAN SAY

36:53.125 --> 36:56.834
TO DEFEND THE WAY
THAT I ACTED LAST NIGHT.

36:56.834 --> 36:58.375
IT JUST...

36:58.375 --> 37:00.041
IT'S REALLY HARD
SOMETIMES,

37:00.041 --> 37:02.875
YOU KNOW,
BALANCING THINGS OUT,
MEETING NEW FRIENDS,

37:02.875 --> 37:05.625
TRYING TO BRING THEM TOGETHER
WITH THE--WITH THE OLD.

37:05.625 --> 37:06.708
I DON'T KNOW.

37:06.708 --> 37:08.708
IT PROBABLY DOESN'T HELP
WHEN THE OLD FRIENDS

37:08.708 --> 37:11.708
ARE QUICK TO JUDGE
SOMETHING THEY...

37:11.708 --> 37:12.333
KNOW NOTHING ABOUT.

37:15.041 --> 37:16.458
WELL, ACTUALLY,

37:16.458 --> 37:20.208
THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED
SOMETIMES TO KEEP
FROM BEING SUCH AN ASS.

37:22.500 --> 37:27.333
YOU KNOW, JACK, YOU GROW
UP IN THIS SMALL TOWN,

37:27.333 --> 37:30.375
YOU KNOW, THINKING YOU
HAVE THE MOST OPEN MIND

37:30.375 --> 37:31.375
AND YOU'RE READY
FOR ANYTHING.

37:31.375 --> 37:34.208
AND THEN YOU FINALLY
HIT THE BIG CITY,

37:34.208 --> 37:36.708
AND, SUDDENLY, THERE ARE
STILL SO MANY SURPRISES,

37:36.708 --> 37:39.583
LIKE, NO MATTER
HOW OPEN YOU THOUGHT
YOUR MIND WAS,

37:39.583 --> 37:41.750
THERE'S STILL
SO MUCH TO LEARN

37:41.750 --> 37:44.708
IN SOMETIMES
PLACES YOU NEVER WOULD
HAVE EVEN THOUGHT.

37:44.708 --> 37:45.750
YEAH.

37:45.750 --> 37:47.208
IF A FRATERNITY
IS WHAT YOU NEED,

37:47.208 --> 37:51.291
WE NEED TO LEARN
TO ACCEPT THAT.

37:51.291 --> 37:56.750
I NEED TO LEARN TO BE
LESS EXTREME ABOUT IT.

37:58.000 --> 37:59.250
COME HERE.

37:59.250 --> 38:01.500
[CHUCKLES]

38:10.583 --> 38:12.500
EH...SO...

38:15.000 --> 38:17.125
LAST NIGHT, I NEVER
WOULD HAVE GUESSED

38:17.125 --> 38:19.125
THAT WE WERE GONNA
BE SITTING HERE
LIKE THIS.

38:21.625 --> 38:24.375
I'M SORRY FOR
WHAT I SAID, PACEY.

38:24.375 --> 38:27.500
LAST NIGHT WAS JUST
AS MUCH MY FAULT
AS IT WAS YOURS.

38:32.083 --> 38:34.792
FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,

38:34.792 --> 38:36.291
I DON'T REGRET IT,

38:36.291 --> 38:38.333
NOT A SINGLE SECOND.

38:38.333 --> 38:40.834
YOU FORCED ME
TO MAKE A DECISION

38:40.834 --> 38:43.208
I SHOULD HAVE MADE
A LONG TIME AGO.

38:45.625 --> 38:49.208
THEN WHY DON'T YOU
GIVE IT A CHANCE?

38:49.208 --> 38:51.708
I MEAN, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO LEAVE, KAREN.

38:51.708 --> 38:53.750
NO. I DO.

38:53.750 --> 38:57.166
I OWE MYSELF
SOME MAJOR REGROUPING,

38:57.166 --> 39:00.083
AND I HAVE YOU TO THANK
FOR MAKING ME REALIZE THAT.

39:01.708 --> 39:04.500
YOU CALLED ME ON A LOT
OF THINGS THAT NEED FIXING.

39:08.000 --> 39:10.041
NOBODY CAN SAVE YOU
FROM YOURSELF.

39:10.041 --> 39:11.875
I PROBABLY WOULD
HAVE TRIED ANYWAY.

39:11.875 --> 39:13.458
I KNOW.

39:17.750 --> 39:19.750
I GOTTA GO.

39:24.166 --> 39:26.208
STICK WITH BRECHER,
PACEY.

39:26.208 --> 39:27.834
HE'S NOT SUCH A BAD GUY.

39:27.834 --> 39:31.500
HE'S GOT A SOFT SPOT
FOR YA. BESIDES...

39:31.500 --> 39:33.542
YOU'RE GOOD IN THERE.

39:35.708 --> 39:37.291
THANKS.

39:45.041 --> 39:48.250
TAKE CARE, WITTER.

39:48.250 --> 39:49.500
YEP, YOU, TOO, TORRES.

40:10.166 --> 40:12.375
BACK TO REALITY, HUH?

40:12.375 --> 40:14.667
HMM. I GUESS.

40:16.458 --> 40:17.917
[SIGHS]

40:22.500 --> 40:24.125
DAWSON?

40:24.125 --> 40:26.792
I NEED TO TALK.

40:26.792 --> 40:28.083
OK.

40:28.083 --> 40:30.500
SO LET'S TALK.

40:30.500 --> 40:32.208
OK.

40:36.083 --> 40:38.792
I JUST FEEL AWKWARD AND...

40:38.792 --> 40:42.250
THERE'S TOO MUCH
AT STAKE FOR ME
TO LET IT SLIDE.

40:42.250 --> 40:43.333
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

40:43.333 --> 40:44.542
I DON'T KNOW.

40:47.792 --> 40:53.125
I MEAN, PART OF ME WISHES
THAT LAST NIGHT COULD JUST BE,

40:53.125 --> 40:57.166
UM, A BEAUTIFUL MEMORY,

40:57.166 --> 41:02.125
AND THE OTHER PART KNOWS
THAT SEX CHANGES EVERYTHING.

41:02.125 --> 41:06.792
AND I JUST DON'T WANT
TO LOSE OUR FRIENDSHIP.

41:06.792 --> 41:09.125
OK. YOU'RE NOT GONNA
LOSE MY FRIENDSHIP.

41:09.125 --> 41:13.083
I PROMISE. OK?

41:13.083 --> 41:14.500
AND, YES,
SEX DOES CHANGE THINGS.

41:14.500 --> 41:16.166
BUT WHO SAYS IT HAS
TO BE FOR THE WORSE?

41:18.041 --> 41:19.375
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

41:20.250 --> 41:22.500
[SIGHS]

41:25.333 --> 41:28.208
I DON'T KNOW.

41:28.208 --> 41:30.250
I DON'T KNOW.
IF I TOLD YOU I KNEW
WHERE THIS WAS LEADING,

41:30.250 --> 41:31.875
I'D BE LYING TO YOU,
'CAUSE I DON'T.

41:31.875 --> 41:35.667
ALL I KNOW IS...

41:35.667 --> 41:39.458
IT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT,
AND IT FELT RIGHT.

41:39.458 --> 41:40.291
AND IF SEX
CHANGES THINGS,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

41:40.291 --> 41:44.083
I SAY, BRING IT ON.

41:44.083 --> 41:45.583
I'M READY
TO EXPLORE THAT.

41:49.375 --> 41:50.792
OK.

41:51.959 --> 41:53.083
I'M IN.

41:58.625 --> 42:00.250
I WISH WE DIDN'T
HAVE TO LEAVE HERE.

42:00.250 --> 42:03.250
SO WE STAY.

42:04.583 --> 42:05.834
STAY?

42:05.834 --> 42:07.000
YEAH.

42:10.542 --> 42:12.000
WE STAY.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.041
AT LEAST
A COUPLE DAYS.

42:16.166 --> 42:18.417
AFTER ALL, THIS IS
THE HONEYMOON SUITE,
RIGHT?

42:20.750 --> 42:21.792
AND I AM
YOUR GIRLFRIEND.
