00:38.606 --> 00:41.643
I'm sorry about the wait,
Mr. Edwards.

00:41.676 --> 00:45.212
I have your paperwork
right here.

00:45.245 --> 00:48.616
We like to take care
of these things in advance,

00:48.650 --> 00:53.387
so you don't have to
worry about it afterward.

00:53.420 --> 00:56.490
You can choose
whether you wanna do burial

00:56.524 --> 00:59.794
or cremation.

00:59.827 --> 01:02.195
Simply check
whichever box you prefer,

01:02.229 --> 01:05.098
and then sign
there at the bottom.

01:10.304 --> 01:12.439
Can I just take him home?

01:14.509 --> 01:18.345
Um, I think that's against
county regulations.

01:26.286 --> 01:29.289
Let me check with Dr. Brown.

01:29.323 --> 01:31.425
Will you excuse me for a second?

02:35.790 --> 02:38.893
Um, I'm sorry, Mr. Edwards.

02:38.926 --> 02:43.430
Dr. Brown said that
that's not an option.

02:43.463 --> 02:46.466
An animal that has passed
can carry infectious disease,

02:46.501 --> 02:48.301
and we're not allowed to...

02:48.335 --> 02:49.937
to let you take him home.

02:52.507 --> 02:54.307
Okay.

02:58.245 --> 03:00.748
What do people usually do?

03:00.782 --> 03:03.417
People go either way.

03:03.450 --> 03:04.786
It's really up to you.

03:06.854 --> 03:09.289
Personally, I like cremation.

03:09.322 --> 03:11.959
You can get a nice urn,
and they have cute ones

03:11.993 --> 03:14.428
with a little paw print
on the side.

03:16.631 --> 03:19.934
And they don't cost too much.

03:22.335 --> 03:23.805
I guess I'll do that.

03:29.911 --> 03:32.613
Uh, and Dr. Brown
will be back in a second.

03:49.063 --> 03:50.965
Hey, there little guy.

03:53.768 --> 03:55.435
How'd you get
all the way out here?

03:57.505 --> 03:58.973
Where's your collar?

04:02.510 --> 04:03.878
Hello?

04:05.980 --> 04:07.615
Anybody out here?

04:10.651 --> 04:12.553
What are you doing
out here, huh?

04:14.722 --> 04:16.958
Sweet pup, where's your family?

04:19.827 --> 04:21.562
I'm gonna miss you, little boy.

04:31.806 --> 04:34.374
How are you doing, Mr. Edwards?

04:34.407 --> 04:36.309
Okay.

04:36.343 --> 04:39.680
Were you able to
get a hold of your brother?

04:39.714 --> 04:42.382
No.

04:42.415 --> 04:43.885
We can reschedule if you'd like.

04:43.918 --> 04:46.453
It's okay.

04:46.486 --> 04:50.658
I want Travis to be here,
but I...

04:50.691 --> 04:54.028
I don't want him
to suffer any longer.

04:54.061 --> 04:56.898
If I woke up in the morning
and he was dead,

04:56.931 --> 04:58.866
I don't know
what I'd do with myself.

05:04.371 --> 05:06.808
I want him to go peacefully.

05:06.841 --> 05:08.408
Okay.

05:08.441 --> 05:11.112
No need to get up,
we can do this here,

05:11.145 --> 05:13.848
unless you don't wanna
hold him when he passes.

05:13.881 --> 05:15.683
No, I do.

05:19.153 --> 05:22.123
Let's get this blanket
underneath him.

05:25.960 --> 05:27.427
There we go.

05:27.460 --> 05:29.396
When loved ones pass,

05:29.429 --> 05:31.566
they often release
bodily fluids.

05:31.599 --> 05:33.466
That's what the blanket's for.

05:33.501 --> 05:35.670
And the first one

05:35.703 --> 05:39.106
is gonna put him to sleep.

05:39.140 --> 05:42.143
You'll see him
put his head down.

05:42.176 --> 05:43.945
He'll be completely out.

05:55.523 --> 05:58.526
The second one
will slow everything down

05:58.559 --> 06:00.061
until his heart stops.

06:13.541 --> 06:16.544
At this point,
I'll check his heart rate.

06:26.153 --> 06:27.889
He's gone.

06:32.193 --> 06:33.928
I'm sorry for your loss.

06:36.063 --> 06:37.698
Thank you.

06:37.732 --> 06:39.767
Take as much time as you need.

07:30.584 --> 07:33.154
Oh, here, I can take him now.

07:33.187 --> 07:35.589
Mr. Edwards, are you okay?

07:35.623 --> 07:38.559
Wait, what are you doing?

07:38.592 --> 07:40.261
Dr. Brown!

07:42.663 --> 07:44.065
Mr. Edwards!

07:46.000 --> 07:47.835
Mr. Edwards!

07:47.868 --> 07:49.170
Jeff!

07:52.206 --> 07:54.175
Jeff!

07:54.208 --> 07:57.044
We can't let you take him home.

07:57.078 --> 07:58.779
Please.

08:04.719 --> 08:06.187
Shouldn't we call
animal control?

08:08.589 --> 08:09.757
Let him go.

09:42.316 --> 09:43.818
Come here, buddy.

09:43.851 --> 09:45.953
What are you doing
out here all alone?

09:55.162 --> 09:56.764
Hey, wait!

10:09.276 --> 10:11.078
Ohh.

10:11.112 --> 10:15.216
Ohh, oh, you like that, huh?

10:15.249 --> 10:16.951
Oh.

10:21.388 --> 10:23.090
Wait!

10:23.124 --> 10:24.725
Where ya going?

10:57.491 --> 10:59.460
Hey.

10:59.493 --> 11:01.162
Hey there.

11:01.195 --> 11:03.898
I have an unresponsive hiker
down on Juniper Trail.

11:03.931 --> 11:05.866
I need immediate assistance.

11:37.198 --> 11:39.099
Come inside.

11:43.170 --> 11:45.339
Why didn't you
pick up the phone?

11:48.075 --> 11:51.278
Just tell me what happened.

11:51.312 --> 11:52.846
I had to put him down.

11:55.216 --> 11:56.984
And if you gave a shit,
you would've known

11:57.017 --> 11:58.953
something was wrong.

12:02.289 --> 12:04.191
That's not fair.

12:04.225 --> 12:05.459
I needed you today.

12:09.296 --> 12:11.999
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry.

12:17.404 --> 12:19.073
He was old.

12:21.141 --> 12:22.510
It was his time.

12:39.493 --> 12:41.228
I wasn't ready.

12:49.103 --> 12:50.404
Say something.

12:55.142 --> 12:57.978
How'd it go?

12:58.012 --> 12:59.480
How do you think it went?

13:06.053 --> 13:08.389
I'm sure it was hard.

13:08.422 --> 13:10.224
- But...
- You could've been there.

13:13.494 --> 13:15.563
Look, I said I'm sorry.

13:15.597 --> 13:17.031
I don't know what else
you want me to do.

13:17.064 --> 13:18.499
I want you to care!

13:34.516 --> 13:36.884
You're gonna make it up to me.

13:40.254 --> 13:43.223
Fine.

13:43.257 --> 13:45.959
I'll do whatever it takes
to make things right.

13:45.993 --> 13:49.631
You're coming with me
to Juniper Falls.

13:49.664 --> 13:53.067
- What?
- We're leaving tonight.

13:53.100 --> 13:54.435
- Jeff.
- No, you said you're gonna

13:54.468 --> 13:56.638
make it up to me,
and that's what you're gonna do!

13:56.671 --> 13:59.206
I can't just leave.

13:59.239 --> 14:01.108
Take a couple days off.

14:01.141 --> 14:03.110
That'll make it
a four-day weekend.

14:03.143 --> 14:06.413
- We'll be back by Monday.
- It's not that simple.

14:06.447 --> 14:08.349
I'm supposed to have
the kids this weekend.

14:13.220 --> 14:15.422
Are you coming or not?

14:17.324 --> 14:18.626
No.

14:18.660 --> 14:21.061
- No fucking way.
- If you don't do this,

14:21.095 --> 14:22.896
it's over.

14:26.400 --> 14:27.935
You owe me.

14:46.286 --> 14:47.955
Jeff.

14:56.997 --> 14:59.099
Give me a few minutes,
I'm gonna go get my gear.

16:24.686 --> 16:27.020
Good mornin'.

16:36.396 --> 16:38.098
Here.

16:46.541 --> 16:49.677
I figure

16:49.711 --> 16:53.581
we can make it to
Lover's Leap by noon,

16:53.615 --> 16:56.116
and we can do that,
we should be good

16:56.149 --> 16:58.520
to make it to
Hidden Meadows by nightfall.

17:00.588 --> 17:02.557
And day two?

17:02.590 --> 17:05.727
Day two, day two,

17:05.760 --> 17:08.295
we climb up the mountain,

17:08.328 --> 17:11.699
up Wolf's Ridge,
get there maybe around noon,

17:11.733 --> 17:14.702
and head down to Spirit Creek,

17:14.736 --> 17:16.704
follow it all the way
to Juniper Falls,

17:16.738 --> 17:18.405
where I found him.

17:18.438 --> 17:19.741
And day three we head back?

17:19.773 --> 17:21.375
Yeah.

17:24.878 --> 17:27.146
Why don't we come back
in the summer?

17:27.180 --> 17:28.616
It's cold,

17:28.650 --> 17:31.653
the ground is frozen.

17:31.686 --> 17:33.353
What am I gonna do with my dog?

17:33.387 --> 17:37.124
Stick him in a freezer?

17:37.157 --> 17:40.394
No, it has to be now, okay?

17:40.427 --> 17:42.864
Why now?

17:42.897 --> 17:44.532
I can't explain it,

17:44.566 --> 17:48.135
I just have a feeling
in my bones

17:48.168 --> 17:50.237
he belongs here.

17:50.270 --> 17:51.573
All right, please.

18:28.943 --> 18:31.244
Hey, Trav.

18:31.278 --> 18:32.513
What's up?

18:32.547 --> 18:34.916
Thanks for coming.

18:34.949 --> 18:36.718
- You're my brother.
- No, really,

18:36.751 --> 18:39.587
- it means a lot to me.
- Oh.

18:39.621 --> 18:41.455
Don't worry about it.

18:41.488 --> 18:43.625
Let's just get to
Juniper Falls, eh?

18:43.658 --> 18:45.760
That's what
I'm talking about, huh?

18:45.793 --> 18:48.663
Okay.

18:48.696 --> 18:50.464
What, that's it?

18:50.497 --> 18:52.900
- What?
- Not gonna give me a real hug?

18:55.937 --> 18:59.306
- I'm here, aren't I?
- Why do you always do this?

18:59.339 --> 19:01.576
You make me feel like
I'm trying too hard.

19:01.609 --> 19:03.911
- Can we just get back on the...?
- Don't change the subject!

19:03.945 --> 19:06.246
- What do you want from me?
- Why does it take an ultimatum?

19:06.279 --> 19:08.750
Why can't you just be there
for me when I need you?

19:08.783 --> 19:11.218
- Man, we got ground to cover.
- We're not

19:11.251 --> 19:13.387
burying my dog

19:13.420 --> 19:14.756
without you being
fully committed.

19:18.526 --> 19:20.293
I'm committed.

21:54.849 --> 21:56.584
What's wrong?

21:58.119 --> 21:59.821
I need a minute.

22:03.991 --> 22:06.794
Oh, my back's a little sore.

22:14.602 --> 22:17.705
What's wrong with your pack?

22:17.738 --> 22:19.439
He's heavy.

22:22.510 --> 22:24.946
What's he weigh, 15 pounds?

22:24.979 --> 22:26.814
18.

22:29.617 --> 22:32.019
You have anything
we can get rid of?

22:32.053 --> 22:35.488
I didn't bring anything extra.

22:35.523 --> 22:38.025
Hey.

22:38.059 --> 22:40.962
How you guys doing?

22:40.995 --> 22:42.930
Been better, you?

22:42.964 --> 22:44.966
Doing great.

22:44.999 --> 22:47.434
Something wrong with your pack?

22:47.467 --> 22:50.071
No, we just brought
too much stuff.

22:50.104 --> 22:51.839
Is your back sore?

22:51.873 --> 22:54.008
Yeah.

22:54.041 --> 22:57.444
Maybe we can tweak the straps.

22:57.477 --> 22:59.714
- Put more weight on your hips.
- No.

22:59.747 --> 23:01.916
I think we're gonna head back.

23:01.949 --> 23:04.719
We're only a couple miles
from the trailhead.

23:04.752 --> 23:06.153
Don't give up now.

23:10.057 --> 23:12.459
Do you mind?

23:14.896 --> 23:16.463
Whoa.

23:16.496 --> 23:18.099
What the hell
do you got in here?

23:18.132 --> 23:19.901
My dog.

23:22.603 --> 23:25.172
You're serious?

23:25.206 --> 23:27.708
What happened?

23:27.742 --> 23:30.611
Stomach cancer.

23:30.645 --> 23:33.915
He stopped eating,
so I had to put him to sleep.

23:35.950 --> 23:38.052
I'm sorry to hear that.

23:40.154 --> 23:42.023
What made you
bring him out here?

23:42.056 --> 23:45.526
I found him over
at Juniper Falls.

23:45.559 --> 23:47.228
I have no idea why he was there,

23:47.261 --> 23:49.130
or who left him,

23:49.163 --> 23:53.134
but I'm glad they did,
because he's changed my life.

23:55.236 --> 23:59.073
And now,
you're bringing him back home?

23:59.106 --> 24:02.910
Yeah, that's what it feels like.

24:02.944 --> 24:04.712
I'm headed that way.

24:04.745 --> 24:06.814
Maybe I can help.

24:06.847 --> 24:09.684
No, we can handle it.

24:09.717 --> 24:11.786
- Can we?
- Yeah.

24:11.819 --> 24:14.487
I'll take some stuff.

24:14.522 --> 24:16.257
Well, if you two can handle it,
I'll be on my way.

24:16.290 --> 24:17.925
Nah, I don't mind
if he comes along.

24:17.959 --> 24:19.827
- I said we can handle it.
- You wanna come with?

24:22.830 --> 24:24.532
Sure.

24:24.565 --> 24:27.068
I can carry something.

24:27.101 --> 24:29.537
Maybe we can take turns
carrying your dog.

24:29.570 --> 24:33.641
Thanks, but I'm gonna
carry him the whole way.

24:33.674 --> 24:36.243
If you wanna take my tent,
that'd be cool.

24:36.277 --> 24:38.112
You got it.

24:41.749 --> 24:43.217
Take that shovel, too.

24:43.250 --> 24:44.952
No, I'll take the shovel.

24:48.823 --> 24:51.025
By the way,

24:51.058 --> 24:52.827
I'm Angus.

25:30.798 --> 25:32.700
How's your back feeling?

25:32.733 --> 25:34.135
Much better.

26:08.269 --> 26:10.204
I'm Ranger Miller.

26:10.237 --> 26:12.807
How you guys doing today?

26:12.840 --> 26:14.108
Good, ma'am, how are you?

26:14.141 --> 26:15.810
Doing fine.

26:15.843 --> 26:17.311
It's a little cold to be
hiking this time of year.

26:17.344 --> 26:19.013
Where you guys headed?

26:19.046 --> 26:22.616
We're headed to Juniper Falls.

26:22.650 --> 26:24.985
How long you plan
on being out here?

26:25.019 --> 26:28.322
We need to be back
by Sunday night.

26:28.355 --> 26:30.357
All right, well I don't wanna
take up too much of your time,

26:30.391 --> 26:33.094
but I'm gonna need
to see your IDs.

26:33.127 --> 26:35.296
- What for?
- Just keeping track

26:35.329 --> 26:37.865
of everyone who's on the trail.

26:37.898 --> 26:40.000
Is that gonna be a problem?

26:40.034 --> 26:41.402
No.

26:41.435 --> 26:43.270
No problem.

26:45.706 --> 26:47.208
Here you go.

26:55.683 --> 26:57.184
How long you guys been out here?

26:57.218 --> 26:58.819
We started out this morning.

27:12.967 --> 27:14.735
I'm gonna need
to see yours, too.

27:18.005 --> 27:19.907
Here you go, ma'am.

27:23.878 --> 27:25.279
You two brothers?

27:28.916 --> 27:30.751
How about you, Angus?

27:30.784 --> 27:33.320
How do you know these guys?

27:33.354 --> 27:36.357
We grew up together.

27:36.390 --> 27:38.359
Yeah, Angus lived next door.

27:40.928 --> 27:42.763
Don't see too many hikers
in the winter.

27:44.932 --> 27:47.134
What brings you out here?

27:47.168 --> 27:49.937
My dog.

27:49.970 --> 27:52.339
Your dog?

27:52.373 --> 27:53.841
He died recently.

27:53.874 --> 27:56.043
We came out here
to spread his ashes.

27:57.878 --> 27:59.780
Sorry to hear that.

28:01.782 --> 28:03.484
Well, I'm gonna have to
ask you guys to be careful.

28:03.518 --> 28:06.187
There was a person found dead
in the park last night.

28:08.322 --> 28:10.090
Was it an accident?

28:10.124 --> 28:12.026
I'm afraid not.

28:12.059 --> 28:13.727
Do we need to leave?

28:13.761 --> 28:16.096
They haven't decided
to close the park just yet.

28:16.130 --> 28:18.332
I think if you stay together,
you'll be just fine.

28:18.365 --> 28:20.768
Anyway, if you see
anything suspicious,

28:20.801 --> 28:23.404
please call the number
on this card.

28:25.172 --> 28:27.208
Will do.

28:27.241 --> 28:28.809
Thanks, guys.

28:35.249 --> 28:36.917
Shall we?

28:40.854 --> 28:43.157
- What was that all about?
- What?

28:43.190 --> 28:44.825
Lying to the ranger.

28:44.858 --> 28:47.127
I just wanna bury my dog.

30:19.887 --> 30:21.523
So, what brings you out here?

30:21.556 --> 30:23.924
I like this trail.

30:23.957 --> 30:27.161
Crosses a railroad
a little after Juniper Falls.

30:28.530 --> 30:30.197
I hop the train there.

30:32.232 --> 30:34.501
So, you ride trains?

30:34.536 --> 30:37.304
Yeah, I been all over.

30:37.338 --> 30:39.406
What do you do for money?

30:39.440 --> 30:41.643
I play a little guitar.

30:41.676 --> 30:43.444
Make do.

30:43.477 --> 30:46.046
I don't need that much anyway.

30:46.080 --> 30:47.649
What about you?

30:47.682 --> 30:50.084
I'm a general contractor.

30:50.117 --> 30:53.187
It's not very glamorous,
but I make my own schedule.

30:53.220 --> 30:54.556
And you, Jeff?

30:56.558 --> 30:59.193
I make indie video games.

30:59.226 --> 31:01.462
Indie video games?

31:01.495 --> 31:04.666
What does that even mean?

31:04.699 --> 31:07.501
It means he doesn't
make any real money.

31:07.535 --> 31:10.938
Luckily he's got family
to bail him out.

31:10.971 --> 31:13.374
You never needed family
to help you out?

31:15.008 --> 31:17.211
Mom and Dad watch his kids
all the time.

31:17.244 --> 31:20.615
Well, some of us
have responsibilities.

31:20.648 --> 31:24.318
They like hanging out
with their grandkids anyway.

31:24.351 --> 31:26.554
You two really are brothers.

31:26.588 --> 31:28.288
What's that supposed to mean?

31:28.322 --> 31:30.157
You act like brothers.

31:30.190 --> 31:32.459
I don't know.

31:32.493 --> 31:34.495
I gotta take care
of some business.

31:34.529 --> 31:36.363
I'll be right back.

31:45.740 --> 31:48.543
I don't trust him.

31:48.576 --> 31:50.477
Why not?

31:50.512 --> 31:53.681
How do we know he's not the one
that killed that hiker?

31:53.715 --> 31:56.083
We don't know anything
about this guy.

31:56.116 --> 31:57.484
He's a little different,
that doesn't mean

31:57.519 --> 31:59.587
he killed somebody,
you're being paranoid.

31:59.621 --> 32:01.589
I'm not being paranoid.

32:01.623 --> 32:04.258
The ranger checked his ID,
she didn't seem concerned.

32:04.291 --> 32:07.294
Yeah, you lied to her,
you told her we were neighbors.

32:07.327 --> 32:09.029
Maybe that's why
she wasn't concerned.

32:09.062 --> 32:10.964
Drop it, Travis.

32:29.684 --> 32:31.553
What are you doing?

32:33.487 --> 32:35.657
What if he comes back while
you're going through his shit?

32:35.690 --> 32:37.391
He won't, I'll be quick.

32:37.424 --> 32:39.359
Travis.

32:39.393 --> 32:40.562
Just keep watch.

32:52.206 --> 32:53.508
What do you think
you're gonna find anyway?

32:53.541 --> 32:56.210
- Ya never know.
- You're gonna mess this all up.

32:56.243 --> 32:58.445
- What?
- That's what you do.

32:58.479 --> 32:59.647
What the fuck
are you talking about?

32:59.681 --> 33:01.516
- I think he's coming back.
- Shit.

33:05.687 --> 33:09.456
- What's this?
- It's just a compass.

33:09.490 --> 33:10.625
Yeah, but it's not his.

33:13.528 --> 33:15.462
Put it back.

33:15.496 --> 33:18.131
Don't.

33:18.165 --> 33:19.667
Travis, put it back.

33:19.701 --> 33:21.536
Act cool.

33:27.575 --> 33:29.076
Ooh.

33:32.145 --> 33:34.114
What'd I miss?

33:57.705 --> 33:59.439
- I'm gonna say something.
- I don't think

33:59.473 --> 34:00.775
that's a good idea.

34:02.710 --> 34:05.078
I'm not gonna mention
the compass.

34:05.112 --> 34:06.648
But, some things
don't make sense.

34:06.681 --> 34:09.181
Like what?

34:09.216 --> 34:11.819
He acted like we were
old friends to the ranger,

34:11.853 --> 34:14.388
like he was part of our mission
to bury your dog.

34:14.420 --> 34:16.290
He seems to be more into it
than you are.

34:18.158 --> 34:20.494
You're not listening to me.

34:20.527 --> 34:22.830
- He lied to her.
- I lied to her, too.

34:22.864 --> 34:25.465
I'm carrying my dead dog,
what if she searched my bag?

34:27.569 --> 34:29.369
Well, someone was
murdered out here.

34:29.402 --> 34:31.237
He's not the murderer.

34:33.473 --> 34:35.442
Why are you defending this guy?

34:35.475 --> 34:36.844
We don't know
anything about him.

34:36.878 --> 34:38.612
I don't think he killed anybody.

34:38.646 --> 34:40.848
He doesn't seem
like that type of guy.

34:40.882 --> 34:42.817
We can tell him
I had to go back for work.

34:42.850 --> 34:44.284
And what about my dog?

34:44.318 --> 34:46.186
We can bury him on the way back.

34:46.219 --> 34:48.422
I have to bury him
at Juniper Falls.

34:50.357 --> 34:52.726
Why is it so important for you
to bury him at Juniper Falls?

34:52.760 --> 34:55.563
Because he saved my life.

34:55.597 --> 34:58.231
- What does that mean?
- He was there for me

34:58.265 --> 35:00.500
when nobody else was.

36:14.341 --> 36:16.978
You gotta check out this view!

36:17.011 --> 36:18.813
We're comin'.

36:23.685 --> 36:24.952
How you doin', Jeff?

36:24.986 --> 36:27.722
I'm okay,
pack's still a little heavy,

36:27.755 --> 36:29.222
- but I'll make it.
- You need me to

36:29.256 --> 36:31.759
carry something else?

36:31.793 --> 36:35.596
- I think we're gonna head back.
- What?

36:35.630 --> 36:37.665
- We're falling behind.
- Hidden Meadows

36:37.699 --> 36:39.232
is just right down there.

36:40.935 --> 36:42.469
We'll make it before dark.

36:42.503 --> 36:44.371
See, Travis, we'll make it.

36:44.404 --> 36:45.873
But, are we gonna
make it back in time?

36:45.907 --> 36:48.609
Why don't you just go home?

36:48.643 --> 36:51.512
Jeff, I'm not gonna
leave you here with this guy.

36:51.546 --> 36:52.747
If that's the reason
you're gonna stay,

36:52.780 --> 36:54.347
I don't want you here.

36:54.381 --> 36:55.950
Sorry, Angus, we gotta go.

36:55.983 --> 36:57.785
The ranger told us
to stick together.

36:57.819 --> 36:59.987
Maybe you'll run into
someone else you can hike with.

37:02.289 --> 37:04.826
What about your tent?

37:04.859 --> 37:06.794
I'm not gonna let you
fuck this up for me.

37:08.462 --> 37:10.565
- Be reasonable.
- This is something I have to do.

37:12.432 --> 37:13.735
Sorry you didn't
get to bury your dog.

37:13.768 --> 37:15.903
Thank, but we gotta go.

37:15.937 --> 37:18.573
My dog belongs at Juniper Falls,

37:18.606 --> 37:19.974
and at this point
I don't give a fuck

37:20.007 --> 37:23.845
- if you come along or not.
- Jeff, wait, Jeff.

37:29.083 --> 37:32.520
I know you took my compass.

37:32.553 --> 37:34.689
I want it back.

37:34.722 --> 37:36.023
What are you talking about?

37:38.358 --> 37:39.927
I'm not playing around.

37:42.329 --> 37:43.998
- Give it to me.
- It's not yours.

37:46.968 --> 37:48.536
Somebody else's name is on it.

37:48.569 --> 37:50.872
Doesn't mean it's not mine.

37:50.905 --> 37:53.440
Now give me the goddamn compass.

38:06.453 --> 38:09.322
You shouldn't leave.

38:09.356 --> 38:11.092
Why not?

38:11.125 --> 38:13.728
Because he needs you.

40:31.666 --> 40:34.001
I can see Hidden Meadows.

41:06.834 --> 41:08.769
You doing okay, Travis?

41:08.803 --> 41:11.238
These boots are shot.

41:11.272 --> 41:14.809
- Let me take a look.
- Nope, I'm good.

41:14.842 --> 41:17.111
We can take a break if you want.

41:17.144 --> 41:18.779
I'm fine.

41:18.813 --> 41:20.815
I'll deal with it
when we get to camp.

41:20.848 --> 41:22.817
You sure?

41:22.850 --> 41:24.652
100 percent.

41:27.755 --> 41:29.223
I gotta take a piss.

41:38.232 --> 41:40.601
You want some?

41:40.634 --> 41:42.269
I gotta take a piss, too.

41:44.071 --> 41:45.906
I'll watch your stuff.

41:55.783 --> 41:57.618
- Jeff.
- I really don't wanna

41:57.651 --> 41:59.220
discuss this anymore.

41:59.253 --> 42:01.188
He got in my face
about the compass.

42:01.222 --> 42:04.025
What the fuck did you think
was gonna happen?

42:04.058 --> 42:05.693
This guy is trouble.

42:05.726 --> 42:07.261
You just don't want to be here.

42:07.294 --> 42:08.763
Don't you see
what's going on here?

42:08.796 --> 42:10.631
- I do.
- Then why aren't you

42:10.664 --> 42:13.200
- listening to me?
- Because all I see is you

42:13.234 --> 42:15.669
- fucking this up.
- You're going to get us killed.

42:15.703 --> 42:16.871
Just stop.

42:16.904 --> 42:18.072
I'm sick of it.

42:18.105 --> 42:20.274
Why is he so willing to help?

42:20.307 --> 42:21.942
Why does he even care?

42:21.976 --> 42:24.278
That comes naturally
to some people.

42:24.311 --> 42:25.212
Fuck you!

42:25.246 --> 42:27.081
You know,
I can't just leave you out here.

42:27.114 --> 42:30.718
Wouldn't be the first time
you abandoned me.

42:30.751 --> 42:34.989
Let's not pretend like
I'm the only one with a problem.

42:35.022 --> 42:38.626
Sometimes I wish you
weren't even my brother.

43:06.253 --> 43:11.759
It looks like we're going to
have the place to ourselves.

43:11.792 --> 43:13.828
You guys ready?

43:13.861 --> 43:15.830
Cut the act.

43:22.903 --> 43:26.974
You're not really
a people person, are you?

43:27.007 --> 43:29.743
- Give me the tent.
- I'm carrying that for Jeff.

43:29.777 --> 43:31.979
Not anymore.

43:32.012 --> 43:34.248
See you at camp.

44:11.252 --> 44:13.354
I'm putting the tent up here.

44:13.387 --> 44:18.325
Go for it.

44:20.060 --> 44:22.363
We should get some
more firewood.

44:22.396 --> 44:24.331
I'll do it.

44:24.365 --> 44:27.434
Jeff, I'd like to get
this tent set up before dark.

44:27.468 --> 44:30.204
Let's get a fire going first.

44:30.237 --> 44:31.739
Help me while
there's still light,

44:31.772 --> 44:33.174
- we can see what we're doing.
- It's cold.

44:33.207 --> 44:34.275
We have headlamps.

44:34.308 --> 44:35.910
It's not that big a deal.

44:35.943 --> 44:39.847
I'll come with.

44:39.880 --> 44:41.815
- What are you doing?
- Where's your hatchet?

44:41.849 --> 44:43.851
In the side pocket.

44:48.355 --> 44:50.357
I'll help when we get back.

44:50.391 --> 44:54.128
I can do it myself.

44:58.299 --> 45:00.334
Where are you from originally?

45:00.367 --> 45:04.171
Fort McGill, Indiana.

45:04.205 --> 45:06.040
You ever go back there?

45:06.073 --> 45:08.175
It's an overcast shithole.

45:08.209 --> 45:09.977
What about your parents?

45:10.010 --> 45:11.445
They still live there?

45:11.478 --> 45:14.014
I have no idea.

45:14.048 --> 45:17.751
I haven't talked to them
in a real long time.

45:17.785 --> 45:19.153
Do you miss them?

45:19.186 --> 45:23.057
Not really.

45:23.090 --> 45:25.192
Take it easy there, man.

45:25.226 --> 45:28.095
Sorry, I'm just
a little pissed off.

45:28.128 --> 45:30.764
Do you guys always fight
like that?

45:30.798 --> 45:32.233
We didn't used to.

45:32.266 --> 45:35.002
What happened?

45:35.035 --> 45:37.404
I don't know, we...

45:37.438 --> 45:40.107
we just grew apart.

45:40.140 --> 45:42.376
I get it.

45:42.409 --> 45:47.915
It's tough to be close
with anybody.

45:47.948 --> 45:50.284
I don't even know
why I asked him to come.

45:50.317 --> 45:52.119
Because he's your brother.

45:52.152 --> 45:54.888
Yeah.

45:54.922 --> 45:58.158
Doesn't seem like
he wants to be.

45:58.192 --> 46:00.261
But he's here.

46:00.294 --> 46:04.865
Who else would hike through
the snow like that for you?

46:06.400 --> 46:08.369
Come on, this is enough for now.

47:14.435 --> 47:18.573
No, thanks, been a long time.

47:18.606 --> 47:22.309
Jeff?

47:37.958 --> 47:42.496
Ah, fuck it.
Give me that.

48:06.987 --> 48:10.224
So what happened to the "G"?

48:10.257 --> 48:12.092
What?

48:12.126 --> 48:13.394
The "G"?

48:13.427 --> 48:15.362
In Angus?

48:15.396 --> 48:18.465
On your vest.

48:18.499 --> 48:20.702
Oh, yeah?

48:20.735 --> 48:22.970
I don't know.

48:23.003 --> 48:28.075
You know what it spells, right?

48:28.108 --> 48:32.514
I've been following
your anus all day.

48:32.547 --> 48:36.383
Haha, have your fun.

48:36.417 --> 48:40.655
I'll find another.

48:40.688 --> 48:42.990
So what kind of music
do you play?

48:43.023 --> 48:46.093
Folksy shit.

48:46.126 --> 48:48.663
Well, play something.

48:48.696 --> 48:52.199
Yeah, play something.

48:52.232 --> 48:55.035
All right.

48:55.068 --> 48:59.707
I got something
I've been working on.

49:20.728 --> 49:24.465
♪ They say there's a mountain ♪

49:24.498 --> 49:27.702

51:22.750 --> 51:26.888
So that's what I got so far.

51:26.921 --> 51:29.356
I liked it.

51:32.326 --> 51:35.295
I like it too.

53:30.545 --> 53:33.948
- You awake?
- Mhm.

53:38.653 --> 53:40.253
What if something
happened with the kids

53:40.287 --> 53:42.890
and Rachael's trying
to get a hold of me?

53:42.924 --> 53:46.627
I'm sure everything's fine.

53:50.631 --> 53:51.498
She was pretty pissed
when I told her

53:51.532 --> 53:54.969
I couldn't take the kids
this weekend.

53:55.002 --> 53:56.470
Did she have plans?

53:56.504 --> 53:58.606
I don't know.

53:58.639 --> 54:04.912
She doesn't tell me anything.

54:04.946 --> 54:08.315
What do you talk about?

54:08.348 --> 54:11.418
The kids.

54:11.451 --> 54:17.390
That's about it.

54:17.424 --> 54:26.601
At least you have that.

54:26.634 --> 54:29.670
I miss them.

54:29.704 --> 54:31.371
Only two more days.

54:38.079 --> 54:42.717
Sorry about what
I said yesterday.

54:46.120 --> 54:48.556
Good morning.

55:13.147 --> 55:16.984
Morning.

56:09.770 --> 56:12.974
You're limping pretty bad.

56:13.007 --> 56:16.510
I'll be fine.

56:16.544 --> 56:21.816
Did you really like Angus' song?

56:21.849 --> 56:23.718
Yeah...

56:23.751 --> 56:25.720
Yeah.

56:25.753 --> 56:30.591
It reminded me of Rachel.

56:30.625 --> 56:34.595
You?

56:34.629 --> 56:38.666
All I can think about
is how much I miss him.

56:43.604 --> 56:45.640
Maybe I should call Rachel,

56:45.673 --> 56:48.676
tell her how much
I still love her.

56:48.709 --> 56:53.981
Do you think that's a good idea?

56:54.015 --> 56:57.450
I don't know.

56:57.484 --> 57:01.122
But I'm going to do it anyways.

59:23.297 --> 59:25.766
Are you guys ready for a break?

59:25.800 --> 59:28.035
Yeah, sounds good.

59:28.069 --> 59:30.204
We don't want to push ourselves
too hard.

59:30.237 --> 59:32.273
There's a good spot up ahead,
off the trail.

59:32.306 --> 59:35.042
Maybe we take a break
and have lunch.

59:35.076 --> 59:36.677
I'd rather keep going.

59:36.710 --> 59:38.179
- You sure?
- Yeah.

59:38.212 --> 59:39.613
Let's just take a break.

59:39.647 --> 59:41.715
We're making good time.

59:41.749 --> 59:44.018
It hurts more when we stop.

59:44.051 --> 59:46.087
You're gonna feel it tomorrow.

59:46.120 --> 59:49.390
Yeah, well, I'm a contractor.

59:49.423 --> 59:52.126
I've worked through pain before.

59:52.159 --> 59:54.128
- What do you think, Jeff?
- Why are you pushing so hard

59:54.161 --> 59:57.098
- for us to take a break?
- I'm not.

59:57.131 --> 59:58.699
I'm sorry.

59:58.732 --> 01:00:03.037
I just want to get back home.

01:00:31.932 --> 01:00:35.970
Look.

01:00:36.003 --> 01:00:39.006
Right there.

01:00:42.443 --> 01:00:43.777
Hey, Angus?

01:00:43.811 --> 01:00:45.412
Can we use your monocular?

01:00:45.446 --> 01:00:48.849
Sure.

01:01:20.114 --> 01:01:22.750
When was the last time
you hiked this trail?

01:01:22.783 --> 01:01:23.984
I don't know.

01:01:24.018 --> 01:01:26.187
A couple of years.

01:01:26.220 --> 01:01:27.321
Why?

01:01:27.354 --> 01:01:30.691
Just curious.

01:01:39.133 --> 01:01:43.470
It's the ranger.

01:01:45.973 --> 01:01:51.111
I wonder what
she's doing out here.

01:01:51.145 --> 01:01:54.516
Maybe they're closing the park.

01:01:54.549 --> 01:01:56.050
What do you think, Angus?

01:01:56.083 --> 01:01:59.053
We still got to bury your dog.

01:01:59.086 --> 01:02:01.789
If they've closed the park,

01:02:01.822 --> 01:02:03.891
maybe we should avoid
the Ranger?

01:02:03.924 --> 01:02:07.027
We don't know that for sure.

01:02:07.061 --> 01:02:12.800
But we shouldn't take
the chance, right?

01:02:12.833 --> 01:02:15.069
What do you use this thing for,
anyway?

01:02:15.102 --> 01:02:20.107
I use it to find the good train
cars to hop onto.

01:02:25.412 --> 01:02:29.183
- What do you want to do?
- What?

01:02:29.216 --> 01:02:31.452
Should we avoid the ranger?

01:02:31.485 --> 01:02:32.987
We've come this far.

01:02:33.020 --> 01:02:37.559
I don't want to turn back now.

01:02:37.592 --> 01:02:41.095
I guess it's up to her.

01:02:41.128 --> 01:02:43.330
We've got nothing to hide.

01:03:15.597 --> 01:03:20.934
Hey Trav, maybe we should
hop off the trail?

01:03:20.968 --> 01:03:24.938
We've got nothing to hide,
right?

01:03:24.972 --> 01:03:28.475
Yeah, never mind.

01:03:37.117 --> 01:03:40.588
- Hey!
- Hey, there.

01:03:44.325 --> 01:03:45.926
How are you guys holding up?

01:03:45.959 --> 01:03:49.196
Not too bad.

01:03:49.229 --> 01:03:53.568
- Got cold last night.
- It did.

01:03:56.970 --> 01:04:01.108
You boys run into anyone else
out here?

01:04:01.141 --> 01:04:08.248
No, ma'am, we haven't seen
anyone since you.

01:04:08.282 --> 01:04:10.351
Well, I already checked you out,

01:04:10.384 --> 01:04:15.389
and I guess I gave you the
speech about being careful.

01:04:15.422 --> 01:04:19.059
Stay warm, huh?

01:04:19.093 --> 01:04:21.261
Ranger Miller?

01:04:21.295 --> 01:04:23.997
Did you find out anything
more about that Henson guy

01:04:24.031 --> 01:04:27.234
- who was killed out here?
- Excuse me?

01:04:27.267 --> 01:04:28.969
The hiker who was murdered?

01:04:29.002 --> 01:04:32.039
Did you find the guy who did it?

01:04:32.072 --> 01:04:36.644
How did you know his name?

01:04:36.678 --> 01:04:40.247
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:44.451
- Put the knife down.
- You put it down!

01:04:44.485 --> 01:04:46.086
Last chance.

01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:46.621
Put it down...

01:04:51.458 --> 01:04:53.994
Back up!

01:05:04.539 --> 01:05:09.343
Let's just take it easy.

01:05:11.145 --> 01:05:15.382
Ugh, agh!

01:05:15.416 --> 01:05:18.553
Ah!

01:05:18.586 --> 01:05:20.354
Where's your truck?

01:05:20.387 --> 01:05:23.625
I got... I got dropped off.

01:05:27.494 --> 01:05:29.597
Toss your phones over.

01:05:29.631 --> 01:05:30.632
They don't even work.

01:05:30.665 --> 01:05:32.567
Just do what he says.

01:05:44.679 --> 01:05:46.447
Let's get a move on.

01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:48.415
What are you going
to do with us?

01:05:48.449 --> 01:05:49.584
Let's just get going.

01:05:55.088 --> 01:05:56.290
Don't do this.

01:05:56.323 --> 01:06:01.462
It's already done!

01:06:01.495 --> 01:06:07.301
You can't leave me out here.

01:06:07.334 --> 01:06:09.303
We can't leave her here!

01:06:09.336 --> 01:06:14.742
You should've kept
your mouth shut.

01:06:14.776 --> 01:06:18.278
I'm sorry.

01:06:18.312 --> 01:06:21.181
Let's go.

01:06:40.167 --> 01:06:44.304
Why didn't you tell me?

01:06:44.338 --> 01:06:46.173
Why didn't you say something?

01:06:46.206 --> 01:06:50.143
I'm sorry.

01:06:50.177 --> 01:06:56.751
You could've gotten me killed.

01:06:56.784 --> 01:06:58.553
What would Rachael tell kids?

01:06:58.586 --> 01:07:00.420
Enough already.

01:07:05.492 --> 01:07:09.062
You're so fucking stubborn.

01:07:14.501 --> 01:07:17.204
I tried to tell you,
I fucking tried to tell you,

01:07:17.237 --> 01:07:19.239
but you always do
what you want to do!

01:07:19.273 --> 01:07:20.675
No wonder your wife left you.

01:07:20.708 --> 01:07:22.242
Fuck you!

01:07:22.276 --> 01:07:25.513
Ah!

01:07:25.547 --> 01:07:28.516
I only need one of you!

01:07:28.550 --> 01:07:35.188
I don't want
to kill anyone else!

01:07:38.458 --> 01:07:39.727
Run!

01:07:39.761 --> 01:07:40.695
Run!

01:07:40.728 --> 01:07:42.797
Run!

01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:29.711
- I don't see him!
- Just keep going!

01:08:29.743 --> 01:08:31.679
- Drop your pack!
- I can't!

01:08:31.712 --> 01:08:33.313
I'm going to die
for your dead dog!

01:08:33.346 --> 01:08:35.817
I'm not doing it!

01:08:35.850 --> 01:08:37.685
Go!

01:09:06.948 --> 01:09:09.282
Ugh.

01:09:09.316 --> 01:09:12.319
Ugh.

01:09:21.696 --> 01:09:25.465
Where you at, Jeff?

01:09:25.499 --> 01:09:27.401
I can't let you escape.

01:09:40.648 --> 01:09:42.314
This is how it's going to work!

01:09:42.349 --> 01:09:45.352
You come out...

01:09:45.385 --> 01:09:49.557
or I kill Travis.

01:09:49.590 --> 01:09:52.727
Don't do it!

01:09:56.698 --> 01:09:59.399
Next one's for real!

01:09:59.433 --> 01:10:03.303
I have a family.

01:10:03.336 --> 01:10:05.540
What's it gonna be?

01:10:10.044 --> 01:10:11.879
Don't do it!

01:10:18.452 --> 01:10:21.288
Next one's for real!

01:11:27.454 --> 01:11:31.559
I don't want to die alone.

01:11:33.060 --> 01:11:36.931
Please.

01:11:36.964 --> 01:11:39.432
Please.

01:11:39.466 --> 01:11:43.004
Don't let me die alone.

01:12:13.134 --> 01:12:18.840
Hold up.

01:12:18.873 --> 01:12:21.142
You look pretty ragged.

01:12:21.175 --> 01:12:25.012
You want some water?

01:12:39.627 --> 01:12:40.928
Hanging in there, Jeff?

01:12:40.962 --> 01:12:42.462
Stop acting like you care.

01:12:42.495 --> 01:12:43.664
It makes me sick.

01:12:43.698 --> 01:12:44.532
I do care.

01:12:44.565 --> 01:12:45.867
Bullshit.

01:12:45.900 --> 01:12:48.970
All I've tried to do is help.

01:12:49.003 --> 01:12:50.905
I still want to bury your dog.

01:12:50.938 --> 01:12:52.073
What?

01:12:52.106 --> 01:12:54.508
I want to help you, Jeff.

01:12:54.542 --> 01:12:56.611
I want to get you
to Juniper Falls.

01:12:56.644 --> 01:12:57.712
I don't want your help.

01:12:57.745 --> 01:12:58.846
You're fucking psycho.

01:12:58.880 --> 01:13:00.948
And what do you got in your bag?

01:13:00.982 --> 01:13:06.187
I didn't kill anyone.

01:13:06.220 --> 01:13:09.690
What are you doing?

01:13:09.724 --> 01:13:11.525
You said you
didn't want my help.

01:13:11.559 --> 01:13:15.428
Back up!

01:13:15.462 --> 01:13:19.200
Wait!

01:13:19.233 --> 01:13:20.768
What are you going to do?

01:13:20.801 --> 01:13:23.037
No, no, no, no.

01:13:23.070 --> 01:13:25.940
- Put him, put him down!
- He was slowing you down anyway.

01:13:25.973 --> 01:13:28.441
Wait, wait!

01:13:28.475 --> 01:13:32.914
No!

01:13:39.754 --> 01:13:42.455
I'm going to kill you!

01:13:42.489 --> 01:13:45.026
Shut up, you weak fucking child!

01:13:45.059 --> 01:13:48.495
Get the hatchet!

01:13:51.699 --> 01:13:53.100
Just leave us alone.

01:13:53.134 --> 01:13:54.535
You know what?

01:13:54.568 --> 01:13:56.237
I don't need you anymore.

01:13:56.270 --> 01:14:02.009
You two can fuck off!

01:14:02.043 --> 01:14:04.078
He's getting away!

01:14:04.111 --> 01:14:05.813
We gotta get outta here.

01:14:05.846 --> 01:14:07.248
But he killed the ranger!

01:14:07.281 --> 01:14:10.718
- It's not up to us.
- Who's it up to then?

01:14:10.751 --> 01:14:12.987
We can go after him
and stop him.

01:15:58.192 --> 01:16:01.362
♪ But there was ♪

01:16:01.395 --> 01:16:04.365
♪ No other way ♪

01:16:04.398 --> 01:16:07.601

01:16:07.635 --> 01:16:11.038
♪ It could not delay ♪

01:16:25.052 --> 01:16:29.323
You look pissed.

01:16:29.356 --> 01:16:32.693
But you made it.

01:16:39.834 --> 01:16:43.304
Travis let you down again, huh?

01:16:47.441 --> 01:16:52.680
Why do you kill people?

01:16:52.713 --> 01:16:53.814
I'm not a killer.

01:16:53.848 --> 01:16:55.683
I saw you do it.

01:16:55.716 --> 01:16:59.186
You left her there to die.

01:16:59.220 --> 01:17:03.023
I didn't want to.

01:17:03.057 --> 01:17:06.861
What about the hiker?

01:17:06.894 --> 01:17:10.965
It was an accident.

01:17:10.998 --> 01:17:12.199
We were drunk.

01:17:12.233 --> 01:17:16.170
He fell and hit his head.

01:17:16.203 --> 01:17:19.974
He started saying
it was my fault.

01:17:20.007 --> 01:17:23.210
I would have helped him.

01:17:23.244 --> 01:17:25.112
But he just kept yelling at me.

01:17:25.146 --> 01:17:27.448
I don't believe you.

01:17:27.481 --> 01:17:32.887
Nobody ever does.

01:17:32.920 --> 01:17:35.890
We're not that different,
you and I.

01:17:35.923 --> 01:17:39.059
I'm nothing like you.

01:17:39.093 --> 01:17:42.229
You're more like me
than you realize.

01:17:42.263 --> 01:17:47.134
You don't know when to stop.

01:17:47.168 --> 01:17:48.736
Maybe you're right.

01:17:54.509 --> 01:17:58.112
I'm sorry about
what I did to your dog.

01:17:58.145 --> 01:18:02.216
You didn't deserve it.

01:18:02.249 --> 01:18:03.951
I don't want to hear it.

01:18:03.984 --> 01:18:06.053
I'm truly sorry, Jeff.

01:18:06.086 --> 01:18:07.788
Even if you don't believe me.

01:18:07.821 --> 01:18:11.292
You're going to
pay for what you did.

01:18:11.325 --> 01:18:15.829
And what are you going to do?
Kill me?

01:18:15.863 --> 01:18:19.733
No.

01:18:19.767 --> 01:18:21.035
We are.

01:18:34.315 --> 01:18:38.252
I'm going to put you down.

01:18:42.557 --> 01:18:46.393
Leave him under!

01:19:10.384 --> 01:19:13.187
Jeff!

01:19:13.220 --> 01:19:17.091
Stop!

01:20:35.936 --> 01:20:42.009
It wasn't supposed
to be like this.

01:20:42.042 --> 01:20:47.047
I'm sorry I wasn't there
for you when your dog passed.

01:20:47.081 --> 01:20:49.983
I'm not mad at you.

01:20:50.017 --> 01:20:53.287
I'm mad at myself.

01:20:53.320 --> 01:20:55.255
I was in denial.

01:20:55.289 --> 01:20:56.490
I knew he was going to die.

01:20:56.524 --> 01:21:02.129
I just didn't want
to believe it.

01:21:02.162 --> 01:21:05.099
I could have done more.

01:21:05.132 --> 01:21:08.402
- You did your best.
- I didn't.

01:21:08.435 --> 01:21:13.641
That's why it's so hard
because I know the truth.

01:21:13.675 --> 01:21:16.176
You loved him.

01:21:16.210 --> 01:21:17.645
Everybody knows that.

01:21:36.163 --> 01:21:37.464
I'm glad you're here.
