NARRATOR:
Once upon a time, an evil queen

00:04.505 --> 00:09.124
banished every storybook character
you’ve ever known to our world.

00:09.218 --> 00:13.211
Who knows the truth
and who can break the spell?

00:13.347 --> 00:14.507
You don't play with the curse.

00:15.641 --> 00:17.472
EMMA:
The evidence is piling up by the hour.

00:17.560 --> 00:18.720
MARY: You want me to run?
EMMA: It’s your choice.

00:18.811 --> 00:20.187
Everyone thinks I killed Kathryn.

00:20.271 --> 00:21.306
You have to trust me.

00:21.397 --> 00:22.512
I can get you out of this.

00:22.648 --> 00:25.025
I think you'd be well-advised
to bring me on as your counsel.

00:25.234 --> 00:26.349
What is she doing here?

00:26.444 --> 00:27.980
I made a deal with you, Gold.

00:28.112 --> 00:29.352
Fear not, Your Majesty.

00:29.447 --> 00:30.732
You may yet get what you want.

00:46.088 --> 00:48.124
GOLD: Remembrance of things past?

00:49.634 --> 00:50.794
What do you want?

00:51.844 --> 00:53.129
I need a favor.

00:54.430 --> 00:56.421
You need a favor from me?

00:56.933 --> 01:01.597
Well, as you know, there are
battery charges against me pending.

01:01.687 --> 01:03.393
I really don't relish the thought
of spending

01:03.481 --> 01:05.847
any more time locked up in a cage.

01:05.942 --> 01:08.354
Now, someone with your influence

01:08.444 --> 01:10.605
can make the DA suddenly realize

01:10.696 --> 01:13.233
what a flimsy case they have.

01:13.324 --> 01:16.737
Isn't that right, Your Majesty?

01:20.831 --> 01:22.787
What do | get out of it?

01:23.709 --> 01:26.200
Help with your Mary Margaret problem.

01:26.295 --> 01:30.004
You see, I've noticed that no matter
how hard you seem to try to stop them,

01:30.675 --> 01:35.419
she and her charming friend just
keep finding ways to be together.

01:35.513 --> 01:37.049
What are you suggesting?

01:38.849 --> 01:40.885
If you want to inflict pain,

01:42.687 --> 01:45.349
then you must inflict pain.

01:46.148 --> 01:48.525
If something tragic

01:49.485 --> 01:51.817
were to happen to David's wife,

01:51.904 --> 01:54.145
and if Mary Margaret
should take the blame...

01:54.240 --> 01:55.446
She'd be ruined.

01:55.533 --> 01:58.491
And you'd have your victory at last.

01:58.577 --> 02:00.568
A trial could be very messy.

02:02.373 --> 02:04.910
A trial.
Now, who said anything about a trial?

02:05.001 --> 02:07.663
Now, once Miss Blanchard
has been incarcerated,

02:09.171 --> 02:12.413
you can plant one of your
lovely skeleton keys in her cell.

02:12.508 --> 02:14.999
And when she tries
to leave Storybrooke,

02:16.929 --> 02:20.296
well, we all know what happens
to people who attempt to leave town.

02:21.809 --> 02:24.346
Give me one good reason
why I should trust you.

02:27.023 --> 02:29.184
Because I always honor
my agreements.

02:31.485 --> 02:32.861
Do we have a deal?

02:39.243 --> 02:41.029
Yes.

03:02.516 --> 03:04.222
That's beautiful, sweetheart.

03:04.560 --> 03:06.061
Thank you, Daddy.

03:06.187 --> 03:07.518
Beautiful? (SCOFFS)

03:09.106 --> 03:10.642
I'd hardly call that beautiful.

03:12.068 --> 03:13.524
You didn't like it, Mother?

03:14.695 --> 03:15.855
You ride like a man.

03:17.198 --> 03:19.564
A lady should be graceful.

03:19.909 --> 03:21.820
You should use a saddle.

03:21.911 --> 03:23.776
l was just having fun.

03:24.413 --> 03:26.244
Well, you're getting a little old for fun.

03:26.749 --> 03:30.333
Who's going to want to marry you
when you behave like a commoner?

03:30.419 --> 03:31.955
Honey, please, leave her alone...

03:32.046 --> 03:33.502
Stop coddling her.

03:34.048 --> 03:35.913
She's becoming an old maid.

03:36.008 --> 03:37.919
All the other girls her age are married.

03:39.345 --> 03:41.051
I had such high hopes.

03:41.847 --> 03:43.178
M'lady, perhaps this saddle...

03:43.265 --> 03:45.005
I'm done riding for the clay.

03:46.018 --> 03:48.395
And don't ever interrupt me
and my mother again.

03:58.781 --> 03:59.941
(SIGHS)

04:01.033 --> 04:02.989
Why do you always have
to criticize me?

04:03.077 --> 04:05.033
I'm not criticizing you.

04:05.121 --> 04:06.657
I'm helping you.

04:09.792 --> 04:11.453
Don't you walk away from me.

04:11.544 --> 04:12.659
Oh!

04:12.753 --> 04:13.959
Mother!

04:17.425 --> 04:19.711
You know I don't like it
when you use magic.

04:19.802 --> 04:21.042
(CHUCKLES)

04:21.137 --> 04:23.002
And I don't like insolence.

04:23.764 --> 04:25.504
I'll stop using magic

04:25.599 --> 04:28.011
when you start being
an obedient daughter.

04:29.270 --> 04:31.682
(SCOFFS) Why can't ljust be myself?

04:31.981 --> 04:36.896
Because you can be so much more.
If you'd just let me help you.

04:36.986 --> 04:38.897
I don't care about status.

Daniel,

05:14.523 --> 05:16.479
I'm sorry I snapped at you.

05:17.651 --> 05:19.027
That's all right.

05:21.030 --> 05:24.193
You'll just have to find some way
to make it up to me.

05:38.172 --> 05:40.379
Emma, hey.

05:40.466 --> 05:41.626
David, I don't have time.

05:41.717 --> 05:42.923
No, no, I understand.

05:43.010 --> 05:44.591
It's Mary Margaret. How's she doing?

05:44.678 --> 05:45.963
How do you think she's doing?

05:46.055 --> 05:48.592
Well, I think the last time we spoke,
she didn't quite get what I meant.

05:48.682 --> 05:52.300
Oh! You mean that you basically told her
you thought she might be guilty.

05:52.394 --> 05:54.646
Look, it's this situation.

05:54.730 --> 05:57.096
It's been confusing
and horrible for everyone.

05:57.191 --> 05:58.397
But, Emma, I don't think she's guilty.

05:59.193 --> 06:00.399
I need her to know that.

06:02.029 --> 06:02.984
Can I see her?

06:03.072 --> 06:05.063
She doesn't want visitors.

06:06.909 --> 06:08.490
You mean me.
She doesn't want to see me.

06:08.577 --> 06:10.738
Honestly, David, I'm sure
your heart is in the right place.

06:10.829 --> 06:13.912
But the last thing she needs right now
is words of encouragement from you.

06:15.376 --> 06:16.491
What does she need?

06:16.585 --> 06:18.291
A miracle.

06:33.227 --> 06:34.467
She hasn't arrived yet.

06:34.937 --> 06:37.599
ljust wanted to stop by
to offer you a chance.

06:37.940 --> 06:41.683
A chance to spare yourself,
and this town, the messiness of a trial.

06:41.777 --> 06:43.108
The chance to confess.

06:45.698 --> 06:47.734
But I didn't kill Kathryn.

06:49.034 --> 06:50.865
Why won't anyone believe me?

06:50.953 --> 06:53.365
The murder weapon was found
in your apartment.

06:53.455 --> 06:57.573
Your fingerprint was on the box
containing Kathryn's heart.

06:57.668 --> 06:58.953
Shall I go on?

07:00.588 --> 07:04.422
Why not, for once,
make it easier on everyone?

07:05.467 --> 07:07.048
Because, confession or not,

07:07.136 --> 07:09.422
you're leaving Storybrooke.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.786
I thought we could
take a ride to Firefly Hill.

07:40.502 --> 07:42.083
And make it by sundown
and have a picnic...

07:42.171 --> 07:43.581
I can't.

07:43.672 --> 07:45.913
I have to be back in an hour.

It's not my parents.

07:59.938 --> 08:01.189
It's her.

08:06.195 --> 08:07.810
she started out
as the daughter of a miller.

08:07.905 --> 08:09.611
Wouldn't she, of all people,
understand...

08:09.698 --> 08:10.858
She does.

08:12.493 --> 08:16.281
But she thinks one's trajectory
needs to keep moving up and...

08:16.872 --> 08:18.328
And I'm down.

08:20.709 --> 08:22.825
She believes that. Daniel,

08:23.462 --> 08:25.043
I know better.

08:26.215 --> 08:27.796
Regina, tell her.

08:27.883 --> 08:30.420
She'll get over it. What can she do?

08:30.511 --> 08:32.126
Have you not seen her magic?

08:32.388 --> 08:35.050
The real question is,
"What can't she do?"

08:35.808 --> 08:37.639
Who cares about magic?

08:39.061 --> 08:42.974
True love is the most powerful magic

A pre-trial interview
with the prosecution?

10:02.269 --> 10:04.430
Explain to me how that is a good idea.

10:04.521 --> 10:07.388
The DA merely wishes to ask
Ms. Blanchard a few questions.

10:07.483 --> 10:08.723
She's done answering questions.

10:08.817 --> 10:11.854
And why are we kissing up to the DA?
Why aren't we going after Regina?

10:11.945 --> 10:12.934
She's the one
who's setting up Mary Margaret.

10:13.030 --> 10:15.567
And what proof
do we have of that, Sheriff?

10:15.657 --> 10:18.239
Just because you found
the Mayor's skeleton key in the cell

10:18.327 --> 10:20.158
doesn't mean we can prove
she put it there.

10:20.245 --> 10:22.236
So what's your plan?

10:22.331 --> 10:24.037
I believe our best chance
of winning this case

10:24.124 --> 10:25.739
is to employ our most valuable asset.

10:26.877 --> 10:27.992
What's that?

10:28.086 --> 10:29.747
Well, that's you, dear.

Doesn't exactly fit the prototype
of a killer, now, does it?

10:37.012 --> 10:38.172
That's how you're gonna
get her acquitted?

10:38.263 --> 10:39.252
By using her personality?

10:39.348 --> 10:43.762
Perception is everything, Ms. Swan,
notjust in a courtroom, but in life.

10:43.852 --> 10:47.219
As such, I'm sure you can imagine how
the jury would perceive Ms. Blanchard

10:47.314 --> 10:49.600
if she agreed to cooperate
with the District Attorney.

10:49.691 --> 10:51.192
These things engender trust.

10:52.110 --> 10:53.611
It shows the jury she's at least trying...

I'm sorry to interrupt.
ljust came by to drop these off.

10:58.909 --> 11:00.524
I thought they might
brighten the place up.

11:06.875 --> 11:07.910

11:08.001 --> 11:09.081
Nothing.

11:09.169 --> 11:11.251
I'm sorry, Emma, I tried. I really did.

11:11.338 --> 11:12.453
I looked into her phone records,

11:12.548 --> 11:13.788
I talked to the people at the toll bridge.

11:13.882 --> 11:17.215
But what can I say,
Regina knows how to cover her tracks.

11:17.302 --> 11:19.759
What about the murder weapon?
Did you find anything tying her to that?

11:19.847 --> 11:22.304
From what I can tell, she never
bought or owned a hunting knife.

11:22.391 --> 11:23.927
That's all you were able to uncover?

11:24.017 --> 11:26.269
Don't worry. I'm gonna keep digging.

11:26.353 --> 11:28.514
And Iwon't stop
until I do find something.

11:34.236 --> 11:37.194
I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna talk to the DA.

11:39.074 --> 11:40.109
Are you sure?

11:40.200 --> 11:41.315
Mr. Gold's right.

11:41.410 --> 11:44.243
I know I have nothing to hide.
But no one else does.

about your affair, Mrs. Nolan,

the deceased, came to your school
to confront you. Is that correct?

12:08.896 --> 12:11.057
She was hurt. She felt betrayed.

12:11.148 --> 12:12.137
She struck you.

12:12.232 --> 12:13.267
In the face, was it?

12:13.609 --> 12:14.598
Yes. But...

12:14.693 --> 12:15.728
That must have made you angry.

12:15.819 --> 12:17.650
You don't have to answer that.

12:18.530 --> 12:19.610
No, it's okay.

12:20.616 --> 12:22.152
I was not angry.

12:22.242 --> 12:24.528
I was sorry for all the pain
I had caused her.

12:31.418 --> 12:33.329
I am being honest with you.

12:33.420 --> 12:36.253
The wife of the man you loved
humiliated you in a public forum.

12:36.340 --> 12:38.456
Surely you must have felt
some anger towards Kathryn.

12:38.926 --> 12:40.166
Yes, lwas angry.

12:40.260 --> 12:42.546
And did you ever think about
acting upon that anger?

12:42.638 --> 12:44.174
Of course not.

12:44.264 --> 12:45.640
I have a hard time believing that.

12:46.892 --> 12:47.881
VVhy?

12:47.976 --> 12:49.967
Because you wanted
Kathryn Nolan gone.

12:50.062 --> 12:52.303
I never said that.

12:52.397 --> 12:54.774
All right, my client is answering
no more questions for the day.

12:54.858 --> 12:56.359
Your client agreed to this interview

12:56.443 --> 12:58.399
because she claimed
she had nothing to hide.

12:58.487 --> 12:59.818
I don't have anything to hide.

12:59.905 --> 13:01.065
Then what is your answer?

13:01.156 --> 13:02.737
You wanted Kathryn gone, didn't you?

13:02.824 --> 13:04.030
No.

13:04.117 --> 13:06.073
Even after she tried
to keep you and David apart?

13:06.161 --> 13:07.867
After she slapped you in public?

13:07.955 --> 13:09.946
After she made you a pariah
in your own town?

13:10.040 --> 13:11.450
Yes, of course lwanted her gone!

13:11.541 --> 13:12.792
She was the only thing
keeping us apart.

13:12.876 --> 13:14.616
So yeah, I wanted her gone.

13:14.711 --> 13:16.497
Is that what you want to hear?

13:28.350 --> 13:30.341
No, this won't do.

13:31.520 --> 13:33.385
What are you doing?

13:39.027 --> 13:41.564
We have a guest.
He'll be here any moment.

13:41.655 --> 13:44.271
I can't.
I have a riding lesson with Daniel.

13:44.366 --> 13:45.651
Well, that's been canceled.

13:45.742 --> 13:47.073
Now smile.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.366
We don't want to disappoint him.

13:48.453 --> 13:49.954
Disappoint who?

13:50.038 --> 13:51.118
The King.

13:51.206 --> 13:54.414
The King? Why is the King coming?

13:56.962 --> 13:59.624
That little girl you saved
is the King's daughter.

13:59.715 --> 14:00.875
(GASPS)

14:04.428 --> 14:05.543
Is that her?

14:05.679 --> 14:07.089
MR. MILLS: Yes.

14:07.180 --> 14:09.887
Regina, honey,
this is Snow White's father.

14:11.935 --> 14:13.141
No,

14:13.937 --> 14:15.643
it is I who should bow to you.

14:18.775 --> 14:20.766
You saved my daughter's life.

14:21.111 --> 14:23.773
There is no way to repay that debt.

14:24.114 --> 14:26.605
It is an honor to meet you.

14:30.120 --> 14:33.487
Regina, dear, the King is honored
to meet you. Say something.

14:33.582 --> 14:34.571
Oh!

14:35.834 --> 14:37.825
The honor is mine.

14:39.421 --> 14:42.754
You're quite lucky to have a mother
who looks out for you.

14:42.841 --> 14:46.629
My dear Snow has many things,
but a mother is not one of them.

14:46.720 --> 14:48.335
We lost her years ago.

14:48.847 --> 14:50.257
I'm so sorry.

14:51.391 --> 14:55.725
Since then I have scoured the land
looking for a wife.

14:56.521 --> 15:00.855
I have yet to find a woman
with an interest in my daughter,

15:00.942 --> 15:02.022
until now.

15:12.287 --> 15:14.027
Will you marry me, Regina?

15:18.460 --> 15:19.449
Yes.

15:21.880 --> 15:22.960
Yes.

15:24.925 --> 15:25.914
Daniel?

15:26.343 --> 15:27.332
Daniel!

15:28.762 --> 15:29.797
What is it?

15:38.438 --> 15:39.814
Marry me.

15:40.982 --> 15:42.392
Regina, what are you doing?

15:42.484 --> 15:43.815
What's happened?

15:43.902 --> 15:44.982
Did you tell your mother?

15:45.070 --> 15:46.981
No. And now I can never tell her.

15:47.072 --> 15:48.437
She won't understand.

15:48.865 --> 15:50.480
That girl I saved

15:50.992 --> 15:52.493
was the King's daughter.

15:52.577 --> 15:55.569
And now he's proposed to me.

15:55.747 --> 15:56.736
What?

15:56.998 --> 15:59.455
My mother accepted.

16:00.836 --> 16:02.167
(SOBBING)

16:10.220 --> 16:12.302
The only way out is to run.

16:15.100 --> 16:16.180
For us to leave this place.

16:16.268 --> 16:18.759
For us to be married.
For us to never come back.

16:18.854 --> 16:20.094
Regina,

16:20.188 --> 16:22.679
do you understand
what that would mean?

16:23.275 --> 16:27.689
Life with a stable boy is a far cry
from a life as Queen.

16:28.196 --> 16:31.529
Being Queen means nothing.
Daniel,

16:34.327 --> 16:36.704
all I care about is you.

16:43.587 --> 16:45.794
Then if I am to marry you,

16:46.715 --> 16:48.580
we must do this properly.

16:53.138 --> 16:54.127
(GASPS)

17:24.085 --> 17:25.746
Dear, what are you doing?

17:25.921 --> 17:28.458
You said to get back on the horse and...

17:30.842 --> 17:32.582
What are you doing with him?

17:32.677 --> 17:34.338
Snow, I can explain.

Are you okay?

17:57.535 --> 18:00.277
No, no.

18:03.625 --> 18:06.207
Why were you kissing
that man in the stable?

18:06.795 --> 18:10.253
You're to marry my father.
You're to be my mother.

18:10.507 --> 18:13.590
Snow, please, listen to me.

18:14.678 --> 18:15.963
Hey,

18:16.846 --> 18:18.131
your father,

18:18.223 --> 18:21.010
King Leopold, he's a kind and fair man.

18:22.477 --> 18:23.933
But I don't love him.

18:27.357 --> 18:29.268
I don't understand.

18:30.360 --> 18:32.225
Why not?

18:32.320 --> 18:34.311
Love doesn't work that way.

18:35.865 --> 18:36.945
Love,

18:37.993 --> 18:39.733
true love,

18:39.828 --> 18:41.659
is magic.

18:43.039 --> 18:44.904
And notjust any magic,

18:45.000 --> 18:47.491
the most powerful magic of all.

18:50.839 --> 18:53.205
It creates happiness.

18:56.052 --> 18:59.169
And that man in the stables,

18:59.264 --> 19:01.004
you love him?

19:01.975 --> 19:03.636
With all my heart.

19:06.938 --> 19:09.145
Then you must marry him.

19:09.316 --> 19:10.556
(LAUGHS)

19:10.942 --> 19:12.523
I will go tell Father right away.

19:13.361 --> 19:15.738
No. No, no, no, no. You can't.

19:15.822 --> 19:17.323
Why not?

19:17.407 --> 19:19.238
Surely he'll understand.

19:19.326 --> 19:21.863
Perhaps. But not everyone will.

19:22.495 --> 19:24.110
My mother, for one,

19:24.205 --> 19:25.945
she'll stand in the way.

19:26.374 --> 19:28.706
That's why you're running.

19:28.835 --> 19:31.793
It's the only way our love can survive.

19:34.924 --> 19:36.255
Snow,

19:36.718 --> 19:38.299
do you know what a secret is?

19:39.929 --> 19:43.012
If you really, truly want to help me...

19:43.099 --> 19:44.088
I do.

19:44.184 --> 19:46.675
Then what you saw, what I told you,

19:48.438 --> 19:50.929
you must keep it a secret.

19:52.275 --> 19:54.231
Can you do that?

19:54.652 --> 19:56.233
I think so.

19:58.990 --> 20:00.981
I need you to be certain.

20:03.745 --> 20:05.656
You can never speak of this.

20:06.498 --> 20:09.456
And above all,
you mustn't tell my mother.

20:12.003 --> 20:14.164
Will you do that for me?

20:16.299 --> 20:17.288
Yes.

20:18.635 --> 20:19.841
I promise.

20:31.272 --> 20:32.398
What are you doing?

20:33.274 --> 20:35.686
Grasping at straws.

20:36.820 --> 20:39.653
Still trying to find a way to prove
your friend has been framed?

20:41.950 --> 20:42.939
it ends up being a dead end.

20:43.451 --> 20:48.161
I used to think I had these
great instincts, super power.

20:48.373 --> 20:49.909
Now, I don't know.

20:53.711 --> 20:56.578
It sounds like you've got
a case of writer's block.

20:56.673 --> 20:58.538
Only without the whole writing part.

20:58.633 --> 21:00.169
Maybe.

21:00.260 --> 21:02.922
You know, when I get struck by a block,

21:03.012 --> 21:05.003
I usually re-read what I've done

21:05.098 --> 21:07.089
rather than plow ahead blindly.

21:07.183 --> 21:10.801
Sometimes I find there'll be a little
nugget of inspiration left behind.

21:10.895 --> 21:12.556
You mean start over?

21:12.647 --> 21:15.389
I mean, when I start writing
I usually have one idea.

21:15.483 --> 21:17.860
And then in the middle,
I may get another idea

21:17.944 --> 21:18.979
and things are different.

21:20.989 --> 21:22.320
So your perspective changes.

21:22.407 --> 21:23.817
Exactly.

21:23.992 --> 21:26.859
When you started this investigation,
what was it about?

21:26.995 --> 21:28.610
A missing person.

21:28.705 --> 21:30.320
Then it became a murder.

21:30.832 --> 21:32.197
And then a cover-up.

21:33.251 --> 21:35.037
If you knew that then,

21:35.170 --> 21:37.536
maybe you would have
approached things differently.

21:41.301 --> 21:42.256
Where you going?

21:42.343 --> 21:43.469
Scene of the crime.

21:44.012 --> 21:45.001

21:45.138 --> 21:46.378
No, I'm fine.

21:46.514 --> 21:48.800
No. You're not.
You haven't slept in days.

21:49.017 --> 21:50.507
And let's be honest,

21:51.519 --> 21:52.599
it was my idea.

22:00.361 --> 22:03.979
Ruby found the box with the heart
right over here, just by the shore.

22:06.910 --> 22:08.446
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

22:09.037 --> 22:10.152
Doesn't seem like nothing.

22:10.246 --> 22:11.235
Here, let me look.

22:11.372 --> 22:12.578
No, it's okay. Just a shin splint.

22:12.665 --> 22:14.371
Let me walk it off.

22:19.839 --> 22:21.375
Sorry.

22:22.050 --> 22:23.756
I know this must be hard on you.

22:24.511 --> 22:26.877
Now, that's an understatement.

22:27.597 --> 22:29.258
I don't know you that well.

22:29.390 --> 22:30.971
But seems to me that aside from Henry,

22:31.059 --> 22:34.551
Mary Margaret's the closest thing
to family you've got.

22:34.854 --> 22:36.719
It's okay to admit it.

22:37.732 --> 22:39.723
August? Look.

22:46.199 --> 22:47.689
What is it?

22:48.535 --> 22:50.150
It's a shard.

22:50.245 --> 22:51.280
From a shovel.

22:51.371 --> 22:53.703
It must've broken off when it hit a rock.

22:57.627 --> 22:59.538
we can prove that Mary Margaret
didn't bury the heart.

22:59.629 --> 23:00.869
We can prove that she's innocent.

23:00.964 --> 23:04.752
And I'm gonna guess you know
exactly whose shovel it is.

23:25.446 --> 23:26.822
(SHOWER RUNNING)

23:30.451 --> 23:33.443
The eagle is in the nest.
And the package is secure.

23:33.788 --> 23:37.656
Henry, I left the code book at home.

23:38.585 --> 23:41.042
She's getting in the shower
and the keys are under the mat.

23:46.843 --> 23:48.629
Don't touch a thing.

24:25.340 --> 24:26.329
Hey.

24:36.851 --> 24:38.011
We got her.

24:51.908 --> 24:53.694
Careful, sweetheart.

24:54.577 --> 24:56.818
A flower is a delicate thing.

24:56.913 --> 24:58.619
Be gentle.

24:58.706 --> 25:02.369
You want it to grow
and not pluck it before its time.

25:03.795 --> 25:05.126
I'm sorry.

25:05.713 --> 25:07.249
It's all right.

25:07.340 --> 25:09.877
You needn't fear me.
I'm only trying to help.

25:10.593 --> 25:13.630
Perhaps you can be
the flower girl at the wedding.

25:13.721 --> 25:17.213
I can already see how close
you and Regina have become.

25:18.476 --> 25:21.309
She's gonna make
a fine mother for you.

25:22.021 --> 25:23.352
She is kind to me.

25:23.981 --> 25:25.232
Indeed.

25:25.900 --> 25:30.485
It warms my heart how you two
share everything, already.

25:33.616 --> 25:36.073
Perhaps you could share
something with me.

25:38.329 --> 25:40.615
Why has she pulled away from me?

25:40.707 --> 25:42.243
What do you mean?

25:43.126 --> 25:46.118
A mother knows her daughter.
Regina has pulled away.

25:47.255 --> 25:50.588
I love her so much,
but she's not letting me help her.

25:51.300 --> 25:53.086
And I know she's unhappy.

25:54.470 --> 25:56.381
Has she said something?

25:56.931 --> 25:59.138
I'd do anything to make her happy.

26:02.270 --> 26:04.226
You'd do anything?

26:04.313 --> 26:06.440
Of course, dear.

26:08.276 --> 26:11.894
You know, I talked to the King
about your mother.

26:12.989 --> 26:14.695
He told me how much she loved you.

26:16.951 --> 26:20.284
Losing her must have been so hard.

26:20.371 --> 26:21.781
It was.

26:25.626 --> 26:27.207
Hearing him, I realized
he might as well have been

26:27.295 --> 26:29.081
talking about me and Regina.

26:29.839 --> 26:32.546
And I don't want us to lose each other.

26:34.343 --> 26:37.585
If only I could show her how I feel.

26:38.723 --> 26:41.931
That no matter what,
all I want is her happiness.

26:44.812 --> 26:46.768
Then don't make her get married.

26:47.315 --> 26:48.475
I'm sorry?

26:51.611 --> 26:53.476
She doesn't love my father.

26:55.156 --> 26:57.067
She loves someone else.

26:57.784 --> 26:59.490
She made me promise not to tell.

27:01.329 --> 27:03.115
But she'll lose you.

27:04.081 --> 27:06.117
She can't lose her mother.

27:09.921 --> 27:11.001
No one should.

27:12.465 --> 27:15.502
Oh! Sweet Snow, it's all right.

27:16.302 --> 27:18.167
She won't lose me.

27:18.888 --> 27:20.503
You can tell me.

27:22.308 --> 27:23.593
You must tell me.

27:30.775 --> 27:32.731
-Can I help you, Sheriff Swan?
-Yes.

27:32.819 --> 27:35.401
I need you to unlock the garage for me.

27:35.488 --> 27:36.568
And why would I do that?

27:36.656 --> 27:39.193
Because I have a search warrant
that says that you have to.

27:40.451 --> 27:42.942
(SCOFFS) On what grounds?

27:43.037 --> 27:45.028
I found this.
Near where the heart was buried.

27:45.331 --> 27:48.118
Figured whoever buried it
might have left something behind.

27:51.045 --> 27:54.378
digging near the toll bridge
the day the heart was found.

27:55.174 --> 27:56.163
An anonymous call?

27:56.259 --> 27:58.716
Yeah, well, I can't control the fact
they didn't leave a name.

27:58.803 --> 28:00.885
I suppose they didn't want
to risk pissing you off.

28:01.138 --> 28:02.218
Hmm.

28:04.767 --> 28:07.133
Now, open the garage
or I'll find a way to do it myself.

28:23.703 --> 28:24.909
Where is it?

28:26.330 --> 28:27.581
Where is what, Sheriff?

28:27.665 --> 28:28.905
You knew I was coming.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.332
How on earth would I know that?

28:31.794 --> 28:34.706
Mary Margaret is a good person.
She doesn't deserve this.

28:34.797 --> 28:36.913
Ms. Blanchard is a liar and a murderer.

28:38.426 --> 28:40.838
No matter what accusations
you throw my way,

28:40.928 --> 28:42.589
that won't change.

28:43.764 --> 28:46.426
She is going to pay for what she's done.

28:48.060 --> 28:50.767
That woman has destroyed the last life

28:50.855 --> 28:53.597
she is ever going to destroy.

29:09.457 --> 29:10.412
Hey.

29:10.499 --> 29:11.830
How could you do this?

29:11.918 --> 29:13.533
How could you do this to me,
to Mary Margaret?

29:13.628 --> 29:16.370
Whoa, slow down. Do what?

29:16.464 --> 29:19.706
The shovel was gone when I got there.
Regina knew I was coming for it.

29:19.800 --> 29:22.132
You think that I told her?

29:22.219 --> 29:24.130
You were the only other person
who knew about it.

29:24.221 --> 29:26.837
I would hope that you would
have enough faith

29:26.933 --> 29:28.889
to know that I would never betray you.

29:28.976 --> 29:30.091
Why should I?

29:31.020 --> 29:32.976
How do I know
you're not lying about this?

29:33.064 --> 29:34.144
About everything?

29:34.231 --> 29:35.812
I'm not a liar.

29:38.903 --> 29:40.894
That is exactly what a liar would say.

(QUIET SOBS)

29:51.666 --> 29:53.076
REGINA: Having a bad day?

29:54.377 --> 29:56.368
What are you doing here?

29:57.254 --> 29:59.245
I wanted to see you while I can.

29:59.757 --> 30:01.167
What does that mean?

30:01.258 --> 30:04.625
Simply that the trial starts tomorrow,
and it won't be a long one.

30:05.388 --> 30:07.344
Then you'll be sent
out of Storybrooke for good.

30:07.431 --> 30:10.594
And I will never have to see you again.

30:12.937 --> 30:15.599
I want to enjoy this while I still can.

30:15.690 --> 30:17.055
Enjoy what?

30:17.149 --> 30:18.264
Jusﬂce.

30:19.026 --> 30:20.141
Jusﬂce?

30:20.945 --> 30:22.776
Watching an innocent suffer?

30:22.863 --> 30:25.149
You've always seen yourself that way,
haven't you?

30:26.701 --> 30:27.781
Innocent

30:28.661 --> 30:30.322
I am innocent!

30:31.247 --> 30:33.954
I don't know what this is about,
I don't know what I ever did to you,

30:34.041 --> 30:36.532
but whatever it was, Regina, (SOBBING)

30:38.212 --> 30:39.543
I'm sorry.

30:41.340 --> 30:43.376
I truly am.

Apology not accepted.

30:46.804 --> 30:48.044
Please, don't do this to me.

30:48.848 --> 30:49.928
I don't deserve this.

30:50.016 --> 30:51.631
I did not kill Kathryn.

30:52.143 --> 30:53.758
Oh! I know.

30:57.690 --> 30:59.521
But you do deserve this.

31:15.458 --> 31:17.164
Are you ready?

31:17.752 --> 31:19.037
Let's go.

31:21.255 --> 31:23.246
You could have at least left a note.

You sneak out of my house
in the dead of night

31:37.605 --> 31:39.766
and think I won't notice? How dare you?

31:42.902 --> 31:44.767
You're impossible to talk to.

31:44.862 --> 31:47.695
Stop with the magic and listen to me.

31:50.117 --> 31:51.618
I want to be with Daniel.

31:51.702 --> 31:54.535
Oh! You don't know what you want.

31:54.622 --> 31:55.907
But I do.

31:56.749 --> 32:00.788
I didn't make the sacrifices I did in life
to get you to the cusp of greatness,

32:00.878 --> 32:02.960
so that you could end up
the wife of a stable boy.

32:03.047 --> 32:04.378
It's my life.

32:07.176 --> 32:08.916
You foolish girl.

32:09.678 --> 32:11.054
It's mine.

32:11.138 --> 32:12.799
After what I had to do,

32:12.890 --> 32:17.350
the deals I had to make
to get us out of poverty,

32:17.436 --> 32:19.051
to get us this life.

32:19.146 --> 32:20.932
And you just want to toss it away?

32:21.315 --> 32:23.101
Stay strong, Regina.

32:25.069 --> 32:27.185
Your magic can't keep us apart.

32:27.279 --> 32:28.394
I love him.

32:28.489 --> 32:29.444
And I love her.

32:29.532 --> 32:30.772
And I love her, too.

32:30.866 --> 32:33.858
If you loved me,
you wouldn't try to keep us apart.

32:33.953 --> 32:35.693
And if you loved me,
you wouldn't try to run away.

32:35.788 --> 32:38.530
I'm sorry, but this is my happiness.

32:38.624 --> 32:39.613
We're going.

32:39.708 --> 32:43.075
No. You're not.

32:44.004 --> 32:45.665
So, what's your plan?

32:45.756 --> 32:48.748
You're going to keep us here forever?

32:50.344 --> 32:52.801
Because that's what you'll have to do.

32:59.478 --> 33:02.595
So this is your decision?

33:04.108 --> 33:06.565
This will make you happy?

33:07.361 --> 33:09.147
It already has.

33:13.826 --> 33:15.032
Then who am I to stop you?

Thank you, Mother.

If you want to have
a life together, a family,

33:44.481 --> 33:47.939
then there is one important lesson
I can impart on you.

33:48.736 --> 33:51.102
It's what it means to be a parent.

33:51.864 --> 33:55.732
You always have to do
what's best for your children.

33:56.368 --> 33:57.483
Thank you.

33:58.579 --> 33:59.910
I understand.

Because this is your happy ending.

What?

34:39.662 --> 34:42.028
You have to trust me, Regina.

34:42.122 --> 34:43.623
I know best.

34:44.959 --> 34:47.871
Love is weakness, Regina.

34:48.629 --> 34:49.664
It feels real now.

34:49.797 --> 34:51.833
At the start, it always does.

34:51.924 --> 34:53.710
But it's an illusion.

34:53.801 --> 34:55.132
It fades.

34:55.219 --> 34:57.676
And then you're left with nothing.

But power,

35:00.224 --> 35:03.387
true power endures.

35:04.436 --> 35:08.054
And then you don't have to rely
on anyone to get what you want.

I've saved you, my love.

Wipe away your tears.

would let you marry him

36:14.381 --> 36:16.667
once she knew how happy
it would make you.

36:16.842 --> 36:19.424
Once she knew how much you love him.

Yes.

very specifically not to.

36:54.296 --> 36:55.706
I'm sorry.

36:56.840 --> 37:00.128
I just didn't want you
to lose your mother.

37:00.928 --> 37:02.714

37:18.612 --> 37:21.775
No. I'm not mad at all.

37:23.283 --> 37:24.819
You were just trying to help me.

37:26.412 --> 37:29.654
However, I'm not marrying Daniel.
This dress is for your father.

37:30.749 --> 37:33.411
But I thought

37:35.170 --> 37:36.421
you were in love.

37:36.505 --> 37:38.211
So did I.

37:38.465 --> 37:39.545
But I was wrong.

37:39.842 --> 37:41.753
Daniel has run away.

37:41.844 --> 37:44.426
What I had with Daniel wasn't real.

37:45.222 --> 37:46.803
It was an infatuation.

It can come in the most
unexpected places.

37:53.981 --> 37:56.563

even more special.

the two of us.

We are?

38:08.662 --> 38:10.323
That's right.

Snow? You need to go to your room
and help with the packing.

38:29.558 --> 38:31.014
Your father wants you
ready for the journey

38:31.101 --> 38:33.683
and we're heading to your castle
first thing in the morning.

38:36.648 --> 38:39.025
You're both going to love it there.

it didn't go wild on its own, did it?

39:24.738 --> 39:27.354
I have no idea what you're saying.

39:36.917 --> 39:39.659
I should have let her die on that horse.

for me trusting you.

40:26.800 --> 40:28.210
But it's also not over.

40:28.302 --> 40:29.883
You must have faith. There's still time.
