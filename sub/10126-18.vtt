09:31.500 --> 09:33.734
EXCEPT IT REALLY
WASN'T THAT FUNNY.

09:33.734 --> 09:35.367
WE RAN OUT OF GAS.

09:35.367 --> 09:37.667
NOW, WHO HAD
THAT CAR LAST?

09:37.667 --> 09:40.300
GOOD QUESTION, AMY.
I THINK I KNOW THE ANSWER.

09:40.300 --> 09:41.900
COULD IT BE...CORY?

09:41.900 --> 09:44.900
WE GOT A LITTLE RULE
AROUND THIS HOUSE, COR.

09:44.900 --> 09:46.500
I'M SURE YOU KNOW.

09:46.500 --> 09:50.400
HE WHO HAS THE CAR LAST
FILLS THE TANK WITH GAS.

09:50.400 --> 09:53.400
YES, I KNOW, SIR,
BUT I'M SORRY,
BECAUSE I FORGOT.

09:53.400 --> 09:56.500
WELL, YOU'RE
ABOUT 3 BLOCKS
TOO LATE FOR SORRY.

09:56.500 --> 09:58.300
NO CAR FOR A WEEK.

10:02.867 --> 10:05.500
DO YOU KNOW, HE COULD HAVE
AT LEAST LET ME EXPLAIN.

10:05.500 --> 10:06.800
WHY? WHAT'D YOU HAVE?

10:06.800 --> 10:09.133
NOTHING. I HAD NOTHING.

10:09.133 --> 10:12.100
YOU KNOW, COR.
I WAS ONCE A SON MYSELF.

10:12.100 --> 10:14.600
I'LL GO IN THERE AND TRY
TO STRAIGHTEN IT OUT
FOR YOU, OK?

10:14.600 --> 10:15.700
THANKS, ERIC.
GREAT.

10:20.200 --> 10:21.767
OH, DAD, I CAN'T
BELIEVE THE WAY

10:21.767 --> 10:24.100
CORY WAS LAUGHING
AT YOU BEHIND YOUR BACK.

10:24.100 --> 10:25.133
[HORN HONKS]

10:25.133 --> 10:26.734
WHOOP, THERE'S KELLY.
BETTER GET GOING.

10:26.734 --> 10:28.600
WAIT. YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN
GOING OUT FOR A WHILE,

10:28.600 --> 10:29.767
AND WE STILL
HAVEN'T MET HER.

10:29.767 --> 10:31.100
YOU SHOULD INVITE HER
TO COME IN.

10:31.100 --> 10:32.800
UH, YOU KNOW, MOM,
WE'RE REALLY IN A HURRY.

10:32.800 --> 10:35.200
KELLY, HON,
COME ON IN!

10:35.200 --> 10:36.500
YOU KNOW SOMETHING?
WE'RE REALLY IN A RUSH.

10:36.500 --> 10:37.667
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

10:37.667 --> 10:39.233
AFRAID I'LL SAY SOMETHING
TO EMBARRASS YOU?

10:39.233 --> 10:41.367
HI. I'M KELLY.

10:41.367 --> 10:43.200
ATTABOY.

10:46.400 --> 10:47.600
HI. IT'S NICE
TO MEET YOU.

10:47.600 --> 10:49.767
I'M AMY.
THIS IS ALAN.

10:49.767 --> 10:50.967
HELLO, KELLY.

10:51.834 --> 10:54.100
OH, AND THIS IS RYAN.
HE'S MY SON.

10:57.800 --> 10:59.300
UH, DID YOU
HEAR THAT, AMY?

10:59.300 --> 11:02.300
THEY'VE...
GOT A SON.

11:08.133 --> 11:09.734
IT'S VERY NICE
TO MEET YOU,

11:09.734 --> 11:10.734
BOTH OF YOU.

11:10.734 --> 11:12.934
SO, CAN I GET
ANYONE A DRINK?

11:12.934 --> 11:14.600
A, UH...JUICE BOX?

11:14.600 --> 11:16.867
ERIC, WHY DIDN'T
YOU TELL THEM?

11:16.867 --> 11:18.500
UM, IT'S EASY.

11:18.500 --> 11:20.600
MOM, DAD--RYAN.
RYAN--MOM, DAD.

11:20.600 --> 11:22.500
NOW THAT WE'VE
ALL MET, LASER TAG.

11:22.500 --> 11:24.934
MR. AND MRS. MATTHEWS,
THIS IS MY SON.

11:24.934 --> 11:27.467
HIS NAME IS RYAN.
HE'S 6 YEARS OLD.

11:27.467 --> 11:28.667
HE'S IN
THE FIRST GRADE,

11:28.667 --> 11:30.767
AND HE IS
THE LOVE OF MY LIFE.

11:30.767 --> 11:33.000
DID I HEAR LASER TAG?
CAN I COME, TOO?

11:33.000 --> 11:35.200
WELL, ACTUALLY,
HONEY, THEY'RE
KIND OF ON A DATE.

11:35.200 --> 11:37.700
SO? SHE'S BRINGING
<i>HER </i>BROTHER.

11:37.700 --> 11:39.600
SHE'S MY MOM.

11:39.600 --> 11:41.934
WELL, THEN I'LL
BRING MY MOM.

11:41.934 --> 11:43.200
OK, WHOEVER WANTS
TO COME CAN COME,

11:43.200 --> 11:45.100
BUT FOR THE LOVE OF GOD,
NO MORE TALKING, OK?

11:45.100 --> 11:47.100
WELL,
IT WAS VERY NICE
MEETING YOU ALL,

11:47.100 --> 11:48.200
BUT WE SHOULD
GET GOING.

11:48.200 --> 11:49.967
BUT I HOPE
TO SEE YOU GUYS
AGAIN.

11:49.967 --> 11:51.834
IT WAS VERY NICE
TO MEET YOU, KELLY,

11:51.834 --> 11:52.867
AND YOU'RE WELCOME
HERE ANYTIME.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.467
SORRY I
THOUGHT YOUR MOM
WAS YOUR SISTER.

11:56.467 --> 11:58.867
IT'S OK. HAPPENS
ALL THE TIME.

11:58.867 --> 11:59.900
COME ON, KID.

12:02.100 --> 12:04.734
YOU KNOW, ERIC,
WHY IS DAD GOING
SO NUTS ON ME

12:04.734 --> 12:06.200
ABOUT THIS
WHOLE CAR THING?

12:06.200 --> 12:08.100
YOU? HE'S BEEN
ALL OVER ME
ABOUT KELLY,

12:08.100 --> 12:09.600
AND IT'S ONLY
BEEN 5 DATES.

12:09.600 --> 12:13.467
IT'S NOT LIKE I'M
PLANNING MY BIG JUNE
WEDDING OR ANYTHING.

12:13.467 --> 12:14.500
YEAH.

12:14.500 --> 12:16.300
YOU'RE WEARING
A TUXEDO.

12:16.300 --> 12:17.567
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

12:17.567 --> 12:20.500
ERIC, LISTEN, WHY DON'T
YOU TAKE THE S.A.T.s, OK?

12:20.500 --> 12:22.133
WE COULD TAKE THEM
TOGETHER,

12:22.133 --> 12:24.500
YOU KNOW,
HELP EACH OTHER OUT.

12:24.500 --> 12:25.500
AH, MY LITTLE CORY

12:25.500 --> 12:28.200
WITH YOUR
"GET SMART QUICK"
SCHEMES.

12:28.200 --> 12:34.233
NO, MY FRIEND, FOR ME, THE GOOD
<i>S.S...S.A.T. </i>SHIP HAS SAILED.

12:34.233 --> 12:37.867
SO THAT'S IT, HUH?
NO COLLEGE.

12:37.867 --> 12:39.700
IT'S NOT LIKE
I'M RUINING MY LIFE
OR ANYTHING.

12:39.700 --> 12:42.000
I'LL JUST MOVE ON
TO WHAT I WOULD'VE
DONE AFTER COLLEGE.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.033
SECRET SERVICE GUY?

12:44.033 --> 12:46.033
YOU READ
MY SECRET DOSSIER?

12:46.033 --> 12:47.200
[KNOCK KNOCK]

12:47.200 --> 12:48.200
WHAT?

12:48.200 --> 12:50.400
GOOD NIGHT, GUYS.
CORY...

12:50.400 --> 12:53.867
HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND
WHY I TOOK AWAY YOUR
DRIVING PRIVILEGES.

12:53.867 --> 12:55.300
YES, DAD.
I COMPLETELY
UNDERSTAND.

12:55.300 --> 12:58.000
SO CAN I
HAVE THE CAR
TOMORROW NIGHT?

12:58.000 --> 12:59.033
YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?

12:59.033 --> 13:00.467
NO. IT'S BEEN
A COUPLE DAYS.

13:00.467 --> 13:02.600
WHY NOT? WHY CAN'T
I HAVE THE CAR
TOMORROW NIGHT?

13:02.600 --> 13:03.867
I SAID A WEEK.

13:03.867 --> 13:05.100
AND I SAID
I WAS SORRY.

13:05.100 --> 13:07.600
AM I NOT BEING CLEAR?
A WEEK!

13:07.600 --> 13:09.700
TAKE OFF MY TUXEDO.

13:09.700 --> 13:11.967
OH, BUT I'M SO CUTE.

13:11.967 --> 13:14.800
YOU KNOW, BETWEEN
THE TWO OF YOU GUYS,
I GOT...

13:16.500 --> 13:17.967
NOTHING.

13:20.200 --> 13:23.867
YOU KNOW, HE IS
TAKING THIS DAD STUFF
WAY TOO SERIOUSLY.

13:23.867 --> 13:25.400
YOU KNOW SOMETHING, COR,

13:25.400 --> 13:28.100
I'VE LEARNED SOMETHING
IN ALL THE TIME
I'VE SPENT WITH RYAN.

13:28.100 --> 13:30.867
THE KEY TO A SUCCESSFUL
FATHER-SON RELATIONSHIP

13:30.867 --> 13:32.900
IS FRIENDSHIP,
COMMUNICATION,
AND TRUST.

13:32.900 --> 13:37.834
AND OCCASIONALLY,
YOU THROW IN
A TOOTSIE ROLL.

13:37.834 --> 13:39.300
SO WHAT
DO WE DO NOW?

13:39.300 --> 13:41.600
WHAT DO WE DO NOW?
WE SIT NOW, BUDDY,
IF THAT'S OK.

13:41.600 --> 13:43.600
I THINK SITTING'S
THE ONLY THING WE
HAVEN'T DONE ALL DAY.

13:43.600 --> 13:45.467
CAN WE GO
TO THE ZOO?

13:45.467 --> 13:46.934
GO TO THE ZOO?
WE ALREADY WENT TO THE ZOO.

13:46.934 --> 13:48.700
REMEMBER, I HAD TO JUMP
INTO THE OCELOT CAGE

13:48.700 --> 13:50.934
TO GET YOUR SIXERS HAT
FROM THE GAME WE WENT TO?

13:50.934 --> 13:52.867
YOU WERE SCARED.
YOU RAN FAST.

13:52.867 --> 13:54.500
YEAH, WELL,
I THOUGHT THE OCELOT

13:54.500 --> 13:56.667
WAS PART OF THE GERBIL...
ORGANIZATION.

13:56.667 --> 13:57.734
THEY WERE LEOPARDS.

13:57.734 --> 13:58.767
YEAH, I KNOW THEY'RE LEOPARDS,

13:58.767 --> 14:00.700
BUT YOU TOLD ME
THEY WERE GERBILS.

14:00.700 --> 14:02.200
I DID. HA HA!

14:02.200 --> 14:03.800
YEAH. THAT'S FUNNY, HUH?

14:03.800 --> 14:05.934
AND THAT IS WHY WE'RE
SITTING NOW, BUDDY.

14:05.934 --> 14:08.934
I DON'T MIND SITTING.
YOU'RE GONNA SIT
WITH ME, RIGHT?

14:08.934 --> 14:12.400
YEAH, PAL.
I'M GONNA SIT
WITH YOU.

14:12.400 --> 14:14.500
HEY, ERIC.

14:14.500 --> 14:16.100
OH, HEY,
IT'S THE BABY!

14:16.100 --> 14:18.600
AREN'T YOU
ADORABLE.

14:18.600 --> 14:20.200
YOU GET
A TOOTSIE ROLL.

14:20.200 --> 14:21.767
OH, THANKS.

14:21.767 --> 14:24.100
OK, TOPANGA.
ME AND CORY
AGAINST YOU,

14:24.100 --> 14:26.100
AND YOU ARE GOING
DOW-HOW-HOWN!

14:26.100 --> 14:27.600
OH, WELL,
THAT'S REAL FAIR.

14:27.600 --> 14:28.934
ERIC, YOU WANNA
BE ON MY TEAM?

14:28.934 --> 14:31.667
TOPANGA, I TAKE
MY BABY-SITTING
RESPONSIBILITIES

14:31.667 --> 14:32.667
PRETTY SERIOUSLY.

14:34.300 --> 14:35.467
ONE QUICK GAME.
CAN I?

14:35.467 --> 14:37.233
YOU SAID YOU WERE
GONNA BE WITH ME.

14:37.233 --> 14:38.734
I AM GONNA BE
WITH YOU, BUDDY.

14:38.734 --> 14:40.300
I JUST WANNA PLAY
ONE QUICK GAME WITH THEM.

14:40.300 --> 14:41.800
CAN I BE
ON YOUR TEAM?

14:41.800 --> 14:43.367
ACTUALLY, YOU'RE STILL
A LITTLE TOO SHORT

14:43.367 --> 14:44.700
TO SEE OVER
THE TABLE THERE, PAL.

14:44.700 --> 14:46.900
YOU'D RATHER BE
WITH THEM?

14:46.900 --> 14:50.367
NO. IT'S JUST THAT
I'VE BEEN WITH YOU
ALL DAY, BUDDY.

14:50.367 --> 14:53.800
IT'S OK. YOU CAN GO
PLAY WITH THEM.

14:53.800 --> 14:55.700
HEY, YOU ARE
THE COOLEST, BUDDY.

14:55.700 --> 14:57.000
TOOTSIE, HUH?

15:00.200 --> 15:01.934
Cory:
OK. I'LL BREAK.

15:01.934 --> 15:03.734
SO, ERIC, WHAT'D
YOU AND YOUR BABY
DO TODAY?

15:03.734 --> 15:07.233
OH, WE DID JUST ABOUT
EVERYTHING THERE IS
TO DO IN THE WORLD.

15:07.233 --> 15:12.867
CORY, YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW ADULT YOU LOOK
TO ME RIGHT NOW.

15:15.233 --> 15:17.300
CAN I HAVE SOME
ICE CREAM, PLEASE?

15:17.300 --> 15:19.567
ICE CREAM?
SURE, BUDDY.
NOT A PROBLEM.

15:19.567 --> 15:21.300
HERE YOU GO.

15:21.300 --> 15:22.934
THANKS...
FOR EVERYTHING.

15:22.934 --> 15:25.300
YOU'RE WELCOME, PAL.

15:25.300 --> 15:26.700
ERIC,
IT'S YOUR SHOT.

15:26.700 --> 15:28.133
MY SHOT. ALL RIGHT.

15:28.133 --> 15:30.367
SO, WHEN ARE YOU GUYS
ACTUALLY TAKING
YOUR S.A.T.s?

15:30.367 --> 15:31.400
A WEEK FROM
SATURDAY.

15:31.400 --> 15:33.233
G-AWWW!

15:33.233 --> 15:34.400
I THOUGHT HE KNEW.

15:34.400 --> 15:36.900
ACTUALLY,
I TOLD HIM THERE
WERE NO S.A.T.s

15:36.900 --> 15:40.200
AND THAT SATURDAY
WAS JUST CAKE DAY
AT SCHOOL

15:40.200 --> 15:41.800
AND PERHAPS
SOME CREME BRULEE.

15:41.800 --> 15:45.467
MMM.

15:45.467 --> 15:47.000
OK, WHY DON'T
WE DO THIS--

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
WHY DON'T WE DO
THE 10 BALL

15:49.000 --> 15:52.100
IN WHATEVER POCKET IT
DECIDES TO GO INTO?

15:52.100 --> 15:55.033
COME ON, RYAN!
COME CHECK THIS
SHOT OUT, MY FRIEND.

15:55.033 --> 15:57.233
RY?

15:59.767 --> 16:00.834
RYAN?

16:02.600 --> 16:03.934
WHERE'D HE GO?

16:03.934 --> 16:05.967
THE BABY'S GONE?

16:08.500 --> 16:11.000
I YELLED AT HIM.
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I YELLED AT HIM.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.300
ERIC, IT'S FINE.

16:12.300 --> 16:14.934
HE'S IN BED.
HE'S SLEEPING.
IT'S OVER.

16:14.934 --> 16:16.600
I FLIPPED OUT.

16:17.200 --> 16:21.100
I FOUND HIM SITTING
OUTSIDE ON THE CURB AND...

16:21.100 --> 16:23.834
I STARTED
SCREAMING AT HIM.

16:25.233 --> 16:26.900
I TOOK MY EYE OFF
HIM FOR ONE MINUTE--

16:26.900 --> 16:30.834
ONE MINUTE...
AND ANYTHING
COULD'VE HAPPENED.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.700
HOW DO YOU DO THIS
EVERY DAY?

16:40.700 --> 16:43.567
I DO IT BECAUSE
I LOVE HIM

16:43.567 --> 16:44.834
AND BECAUSE HE'S MY SON.

16:47.300 --> 16:51.600
ERIC, YOU'RE THE ONE
WITH THE CHOICE HERE.

16:51.600 --> 16:52.967
YOU KNOW, I WAS
WITH HIM ALL DAY.

16:52.967 --> 16:54.133
I JUST WANTED
A MINUTE TO MYSELF,

16:54.133 --> 16:56.767
AND HE GOT SO UPSET.

16:56.767 --> 16:58.467
YEAH, BUT HE'S
NOT UPSET AT YOU.

16:58.467 --> 17:00.934
HE'S UPSET AT NOT HAVING
A FULL-TIME FATHER

17:00.934 --> 17:03.900
EVERY MINUTE OF EVERY DAY,

17:03.900 --> 17:06.667
YOU KNOW, TO MAKE UP
FOR WHAT HE LOST.

17:09.700 --> 17:11.767
HE NEEDS SO MUCH.

17:11.767 --> 17:13.934
YEAH...HE DOES.

17:16.600 --> 17:21.000
ERIC, YOU ARE GONNA BE
SUCH A GREAT DAD...

17:21.000 --> 17:23.233
BUT WHEN YOU'RE READY.

17:24.300 --> 17:26.133
JUST BECAUSE I'M A MOM

17:26.133 --> 17:27.600
DOESN'T MEAN YOU
HAVE TO BE A DAD.

17:29.834 --> 17:33.200
KELLY, I'M NOT LOOKING
TO GET OUT OF THIS.

17:33.200 --> 17:35.834
I KNOW THAT, ERIC...

17:35.834 --> 17:37.033
BUT LISTEN TO ME.

17:38.967 --> 17:43.500
YOU STILL HAVE
SO MANY OPTIONS AVAILABLE
TO YOU IN YOUR LIFE.

17:43.500 --> 17:45.233
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEM.

17:47.767 --> 17:49.600
ERIC, YOU KNOW I'M RIGHT.

17:53.767 --> 17:55.567
YOU'RE DUMPING ME.

17:57.200 --> 18:01.934
NO. I JUST THINK
THAT THE FAIR THING WOULD
BE TO GET OUT OF THIS

18:01.934 --> 18:04.033
BEFORE ANYBODY
GETS TOO ATTACHED.

18:05.967 --> 18:07.834
I SEE.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.667
I LET YOU DOWN.

18:13.667 --> 18:16.734
NO. NO, ERIC. THE ONLY WAY
YOU COULD'VE LET ME DOWN

18:16.734 --> 18:20.300
IS IF YOU HAD STUCK AROUND
JUST TO BE A NICE GUY.

18:20.300 --> 18:21.467
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN HAPPY.
NEITHER WOULD WE.

18:21.467 --> 18:23.000
KELLY...

18:24.500 --> 18:28.100
I'M NOT LOOKING
TO GET OUT OF THIS.

18:30.567 --> 18:33.200
WELL, YOU KNOW
WHERE WE LIVE.

18:37.300 --> 18:40.800
Ryan:
MOMMY, I NEED YOU!

18:40.800 --> 18:41.834
I GOTTA GO, ERIC.

18:43.567 --> 18:45.467
BYE.

19:13.934 --> 19:17.300
TV: THE FORECAST--
MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES TODAY,

19:17.300 --> 19:19.200
WITH BRISK EASTERLY WINDS,
EXPECT A HIGH...

19:24.567 --> 19:26.200
[WHISPERING]
Yes.

19:29.300 --> 19:31.867
HEY, MOMMY, DADDY,
HOW YOU DOING?

19:31.867 --> 19:33.900
LOOK AT YOU TWO.
WATCHING TV.

19:33.900 --> 19:35.600
OOH, THESE EYES.

19:35.600 --> 19:37.400
BE NICE TO LOOK
AT SOMETHING

19:37.400 --> 19:39.300
OTHER THAN A BOOK,
DON'T YOU KNOW?

19:39.300 --> 19:42.000
WE KNOW
YOU TOOK THE CAR.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.133
UH, SORRY, GUYS.

19:44.133 --> 19:46.200
LISTEN, MY FRIENDS
NEEDED A RIDE.

19:46.200 --> 19:48.000
YOU WEREN'T AROUND.
IT WAS LATE--

19:48.000 --> 19:49.033
Alan:
I DON'T CARE.

19:49.033 --> 19:50.767
I TOLD YOU A WEEK.
YOU TOOK IT ANYWAY.

19:50.767 --> 19:52.967
YOU JUST BOUGHT
YOURSELF 2 WEEKS.

19:52.967 --> 19:56.000
DAD! MY FRIENDS
NEEDED A RIDE, OK?

19:56.000 --> 19:58.834
IT WAS LATE.
WHY ARE YOU TREATING
ME LIKE A KID?

19:58.834 --> 20:00.200
'CAUSE YOU ARE A KID.

20:00.200 --> 20:02.700
ERIC, THIS IS
NONE OF YOUR
BUSINESS, OK?

20:02.700 --> 20:04.567
YOU KNOW SOMETHING?
YOU'RE RIGHT. IT'S NOT.

20:04.567 --> 20:06.734
BECAUSE I AM NOT A DAD,

20:06.734 --> 20:08.734
BUT I DO KNOW HE'S GOT
A TOUGH TIME RAISING US,

20:08.734 --> 20:10.133
AND I KNOW THAT WE
DON'T MAKE IT ANY EASIER.

20:10.133 --> 20:12.300
YOU THINK HE LIKES
YELLING AT US?

20:12.300 --> 20:13.567
YOU THINK HE
LIKES WHEN YOU DO
SOMETHING WRONG?

20:13.567 --> 20:14.834
HE DOESN'T.
HE HATES IT.

20:14.834 --> 20:16.700
AND HE CAN'T
KEEP HIS EYE ON US
EVERY SECOND.

20:16.700 --> 20:17.834
NOW, GO TO YOUR ROOM!

20:19.767 --> 20:21.400
DAD, ARE YOU GONNA
LET HIM JUST--

20:21.400 --> 20:22.967
GO TO YOUR ROOM.

20:30.000 --> 20:34.900
WELL...MAYBE YOU ARE
READY TO BE A DAD.

20:34.900 --> 20:38.934
HMM. SHE DUMPED ME.

20:38.934 --> 20:40.934
I'M GONNA GO UPSTAIRS
AND STUDY FOR MY S.A.T.s.

20:50.567 --> 20:52.867
[DOOR OPENS]

20:52.867 --> 20:55.133
HI. HOW ARE YOU TWO
THIS EVENING?

20:55.133 --> 20:57.100
YOU'RE HOME
A LITTLE LATE
THIS EVENING.

20:57.100 --> 20:59.000
YES, WE ARE.
ISN'T THAT INTERESTING?

20:59.000 --> 21:01.100
CORY, DON'T MAKE
A BIG DEAL OF IT.

21:01.100 --> 21:03.100
NO, NO, NO.
I JUST WANNA KNOW.

21:03.100 --> 21:06.000
UM...WHO HAD
THE CAR LAST?

21:06.000 --> 21:07.600
HIM.

21:07.600 --> 21:10.400
REALLY? DAD DID,
DON'T YA KNOW?

21:10.400 --> 21:11.467
CORY, LET IT GO.

21:11.467 --> 21:13.967
NO, NO, NO.
I JUST WANNA KNOW

21:13.967 --> 21:16.000
WHAT HAPPENED
TO THAT HOUSE RULE.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.500
UM, YOU KNOW,
THE ONE THAT GOES

21:18.500 --> 21:22.200
"WHOEVER HAD
THE CAR LAST PUTS
GAS IN THE TANK."

21:22.200 --> 21:25.867
SORRY, COR.
I FORGOT.

21:25.867 --> 21:27.400
UH, WELL, ALAN,

21:27.400 --> 21:30.600
YOU'RE ABOUT
7 BLOCKS LATE
FOR SORRY.

21:30.600 --> 21:33.100
WAIT A MINUTE.
LET ME GET
THIS STRAIGHT.

21:33.100 --> 21:34.467
YOU'RE OUT WITH
YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

21:34.467 --> 21:36.934
YOU LEGITIMATELY
RUN OUT OF GAS.

21:36.934 --> 21:39.133
YOU PUSH THE CAR
BACK 7 BLOCKS

21:39.133 --> 21:40.300
JUST TO YELL AT ME?

21:40.300 --> 21:42.233
NO. I JUST WANTED
TO EXPLAIN

21:42.233 --> 21:43.900
WHY WE WERE
HOME SO LATE

21:43.900 --> 21:45.000
AND TO SAY
THANK YOU.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.867
CORY!
AND THANK YOU,
TOO!
