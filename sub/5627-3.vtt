00:06.880 --> 00:08.210
Turning to the weather,

00:08.210 --> 00:10.210
it's 79 degrees right now in Savannah...

00:10.210 --> 00:12.460
Hey, Dana, the floral foam
we ordered came in.

00:12.460 --> 00:14.830
Yeah, okay.

00:17.580 --> 00:19.460
-Oh, here, let me help you.
-Oh, that's okay, I got it.

00:19.460 --> 00:20.710
Okay.

00:21.580 --> 00:23.080
So, how was the shoot?

00:23.080 --> 00:25.500
Fine. Except the whole time
the groom had this look on his face,

00:25.500 --> 00:27.290
like, "What did I get myself into?"

00:28.580 --> 00:30.170
-These are nice.
-Thanks.

00:33.170 --> 00:34.920
Hey, so which one's the bride-to-be?

00:36.000 --> 00:37.120
The blonde.

00:37.120 --> 00:40.290
Oh, my gosh, this is adorable.
They look like you and Patrick.

00:40.960 --> 00:43.170
-So, when's the big day?
-Next Sunday.

00:43.170 --> 00:44.710
Congratulations.

00:44.710 --> 00:47.330
-You're gonna make a beautiful bride.
-Thank you.

00:47.330 --> 00:49.960
I'm Ryan Becker.
I'd love to take your wedding photos,

00:49.960 --> 00:51.500
but I think I'm a little late.

00:51.500 --> 00:52.620
-Thank you.
-Yeah, sorry.

00:52.620 --> 00:55.250
Well, tell your friends.
When are you getting married?

00:55.250 --> 00:57.830
Me? No. I don't even have a boyfriend.

00:57.830 --> 00:59.210
That can't be true.

01:00.790 --> 01:03.000
Um, hey, we're going to a bar tonight

01:03.000 --> 01:04.960
called The Wolf and The Rose.
Do you know it?

01:04.960 --> 01:06.920
-We heard it's haunted.
-So they say.

01:06.920 --> 01:09.920
Let me guess, that's where
your bachelorette party's going to be?

01:09.920 --> 01:11.080
You should come by for a drink.

01:12.210 --> 01:15.000
I don't know, you girls
get pretty wild at those things.

01:19.420 --> 01:22.080
That's it. Good pace, kids.

01:22.080 --> 01:23.330
Keep it up.

01:26.580 --> 01:28.460
Hey, come on, D. That's all you have?

01:28.460 --> 01:29.670
Oh!

01:29.670 --> 01:31.460
Aw, come on, now, old man.
What we doin'?

01:31.460 --> 01:32.790
Come on, hall of fame.

01:32.790 --> 01:34.380
I'll show you hall of fame. Let's do it.

01:34.380 --> 01:36.080
Wait a minute, I was playin', Mike!

01:38.540 --> 01:40.120
All right, listen up, youngsters.

01:40.460 --> 01:43.170
If you want a shot
at being in the NFL or the FBI,

01:43.540 --> 01:45.750
I need you to go out and play really hard

01:45.750 --> 01:48.210
and have a great time
for 60 minutes every day.

01:48.580 --> 01:50.080
That's gonna keep you
healthy and strong.

01:50.580 --> 01:53.250
And don't forget, you have to
eat right for greatness,

01:53.250 --> 01:54.750
on and off the field.

01:54.750 --> 01:56.620
If anybody knows about greatness,
it's this man right here,

01:56.620 --> 01:58.750
Mr. Michael Irvin.
That's right, give it up.

01:59.120 --> 02:01.920
All right.
Get up out of here, go have some fun.

02:01.920 --> 02:04.170
Let me see who's the fastest.
Go, go, go!

02:05.420 --> 02:06.580
Look at 'em run, man.

02:06.580 --> 02:07.960
Yeah, you got a great thing here.

02:07.960 --> 02:10.080
Yeah. I appreciate you coming out
to see my kids, D.

02:10.500 --> 02:11.830
Come on, man, it's nothing, Mike.

02:11.830 --> 02:13.500
When I heard you were
out here doing this,

02:13.500 --> 02:14.830
you know I had to be here.

02:16.330 --> 02:18.170
-I'll let you get that, buddy.
-Yeah.

02:18.170 --> 02:19.670
But next time you're in town,

02:19.670 --> 02:20.920
let's catch another game, you and me.

02:20.920 --> 02:22.170
For sure.

02:22.170 --> 02:23.670
-Love, man.
-Good to see you, man.

02:23.670 --> 02:24.880
-Good seeing you, too.
-

02:24.880 --> 02:26.040
Good seeing you.

02:27.080 --> 02:28.290
Hey, D.

02:28.580 --> 02:30.790
If my Cowboys don't make it
to the Super Bowl,

02:31.210 --> 02:32.460
hopefully your Bears do.

02:34.210 --> 02:36.420
Mike, if you were still on the Cowboys,

02:36.420 --> 02:38.420
-I might be worried.
-Yeah.

02:38.420 --> 02:39.580
Oof.

02:39.580 --> 02:42.120
-Ah, look at him. He's still got it.
-All right, baby.

02:45.790 --> 02:48.330
Hey, what up, mama

02:48.330 --> 02:52.250
You are correct. Please pass go
and collect 200 kisses from moi

02:52.250 --> 02:54.170
and Hotch wants to see us.

02:54.880 --> 02:56.380
-For what?
-He didn't say.

02:56.380 --> 02:58.120
But I'm having flashbacks
to being in high school

02:58.120 --> 02:59.460
and having to go
to the principal's office.

02:59.460 --> 03:00.880
You are too cute. Just breathe, mama.

03:01.210 --> 03:02.670
-Okay.
-I'm coming in now.

03:09.540 --> 03:12.580
I got a call from the warden at
ADX Florence, in Colorado.

03:12.960 --> 03:16.040
Giuseppe Montolo has refused
our latest request to talk to him.

03:16.040 --> 03:17.790
He told the warden
to tell us he's too busy.

03:17.790 --> 03:20.330
He's a hitman in prison.
How busy can he be?

03:20.330 --> 03:22.250
He's playing us.
The only leverage he has

03:22.250 --> 03:25.250
is a list of 12 potential victims
targeted by a network of hitmen.

03:25.540 --> 03:27.830
As long as he keeps this list
of the dirty dozen close to the vest,

03:27.830 --> 03:29.080
he keeps us on the hook.

03:29.080 --> 03:31.380
Well, that may be.
We still have to treat this as a dead end.

03:31.380 --> 03:33.380
Have you found anything
to help us identify

03:33.380 --> 03:34.580
who the potential targets are?

03:34.580 --> 03:36.290
Sir, I've been working
all my channels 24/7,

03:36.290 --> 03:38.120
-shaking every digital tree. Nothing yet.
-All right.

03:38.120 --> 03:39.420
Well, keep digging,
we can't protect them

03:39.420 --> 03:40.960
until we know who they are.

03:45.750 --> 03:46.880
What?

03:47.290 --> 03:49.250
What's going on
in that beautiful mind of yours?

03:49.250 --> 03:51.540
I have been up every night

03:51.540 --> 03:53.460
thinking about
how somewhere out there

03:53.460 --> 03:55.210
there are the lives of 12 strangers

03:55.210 --> 03:57.380
in my freakishly beautiful,
doll-like hands,

03:57.380 --> 04:00.170
and what if I don't get there in time
and they're already dead or mostly...

04:00.170 --> 04:03.000
Stop. Stop, stop. Look at me.
You're gonna find them.

04:06.080 --> 04:07.960
Right. Of course I will.

04:07.960 --> 04:09.620
And when we get a break in the case,

04:09.620 --> 04:11.460
we're gonna put away
all of the bad guys

04:11.460 --> 04:12.750
just like we always do.

04:16.290 --> 04:17.790
Because you said so.

04:30.620 --> 04:33.080
Okay. Savannah, Georgia.

04:33.080 --> 04:35.080
Known for its charm
and southern hospitality,

04:35.080 --> 04:37.920
though not so much for
Brandy Green of Dover, Delaware,

04:37.920 --> 04:39.580
because three months ago,
she came to town

04:39.580 --> 04:40.710
for a bachelorette party,

04:40.710 --> 04:43.330
and after a night of bar hopping
with her bridesmaids,

04:43.330 --> 04:45.460
ended up in a dumpster in a back alley.

04:45.460 --> 04:47.920
Cause of death was
blunt force trauma to the head.

04:47.920 --> 04:49.750
What's that wrapped around her face?

04:49.750 --> 04:51.500
Oh, that would be a sash
she was wearing all night

04:51.500 --> 04:53.210
that says "Bride-to-be"
embroidered on it.

04:53.210 --> 04:56.040
The wrapping could be ritualistic,
like a shroud of some sort.

04:56.040 --> 04:57.830
Or a sign of the killer's remorse.

04:57.830 --> 05:00.500
If this happened three months ago,
why are we getting this now?

05:00.500 --> 05:02.960
Because two days ago,
the body of Ashley Wilcox

05:02.960 --> 05:04.790
of Dayton, Ohio,
was also found in an alley dumpster

05:04.790 --> 05:07.380
-in Savannah.
-And she also had blunt force trauma,

05:07.380 --> 05:09.790
but she was strangled to death
with her bride-to-be sash.

05:09.790 --> 05:12.380
It's unlikely the work
of the same jilted lover,

05:12.380 --> 05:15.330
since the two women lived in
different states hundreds of miles apart.

05:15.620 --> 05:18.040
They could be surrogates.
Any sign of sexual assault?

05:18.420 --> 05:20.210
None on Brandy.
We don't know about Ashley yet.

05:20.210 --> 05:21.830
What's interesting is
the UnSub doesn't care

05:21.830 --> 05:23.540
about hiding the bodies very well.

05:23.540 --> 05:26.540
Well, he'd have to be physically fit
to lift the bodies into the dumpsters.

05:26.540 --> 05:30.920
He could be sending a message that
to him women are trash, disposable.

05:30.920 --> 05:32.830
No, this is about marriage.

05:32.830 --> 05:35.000
He's taking these brides
on the eve of what should be

05:35.000 --> 05:36.420
the happiest day of their lives.

05:36.710 --> 05:38.120
He wants to crush that.

05:38.670 --> 05:40.210
Their weddings have
become their wakes.

05:44.790 --> 05:46.880
Let me hear you! Come on!

05:46.880 --> 05:48.500
- -

05:48.500 --> 05:50.330
Shot! Shot! Shot!

05:52.880 --> 05:55.250
I'm getting married, bitches!

06:09.120 --> 06:10.960
I need some air. I'll be right back.

06:27.290 --> 06:28.500
Hey.

06:29.080 --> 06:30.120
Open up.

06:30.790 --> 06:32.000
Anybody?

06:33.290 --> 06:34.620
Damn.

06:39.290 --> 06:40.420
Hey!

06:40.880 --> 06:43.040
-I'm walking here.
-I'm so sorry.

06:43.040 --> 06:45.460
Trees are lazy.

06:45.960 --> 06:50.040
Cold as a monkey's ears and toes.

06:50.500 --> 06:52.000
Bitcoin.

07:40.960 --> 07:43.920
"And think not that you can
direct the course of love,

07:43.920 --> 07:47.790
"for love, if it finds you worthy,
directs your course."

07:48.460 --> 07:50.710
Kahlil Gibran's The Prophet.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.710
Established in 1733,
Savannah is the oldest city in Georgia

07:55.710 --> 07:58.250
and one of the South's
most popular wedding destinations.

07:58.250 --> 08:00.670
Brandy and Ashley are both
low-risk lifestyle victims,

08:00.670 --> 08:03.120
but their behavior the nights
they were murdered was anything but.

08:03.380 --> 08:05.170
Bar hopping,
being intoxicated in public,

08:05.170 --> 08:06.670
getting separated from their friends,

08:06.670 --> 08:08.170
all of that would have raised
their risk levels,

08:08.170 --> 08:09.290
making them easy prey.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.120
But I am not victim blaming here.

08:12.120 --> 08:14.000
It's entirely understandable
that both women

08:14.000 --> 08:15.330
would have wanted to enjoy themselves

08:15.330 --> 08:16.790
during their last nights
as single women.

08:16.790 --> 08:19.960
And from the UnSub's point of view,
the bars are target rich environments.

08:19.960 --> 08:21.960
But why pick only brides-to-be?

08:21.960 --> 08:24.420
Why not choose women
a little less high-profile?

08:24.670 --> 08:27.580
Wearing a bride-to-be sash must be
like waving a red cape at a bull.

08:27.580 --> 08:29.080
Actually, bulls are color-blind.

08:29.080 --> 08:31.250
So, it doesn't really matter
what color cape a matador waves,

08:31.250 --> 08:34.500
it's the cape's movement that elicits
an aggressive charge response.

08:36.210 --> 08:39.080
But Morgan's metaphor
still applies here.

08:39.080 --> 08:41.920
This is probably a man who had
his own engagement broken off,

08:41.920 --> 08:44.830
so living in Savannah, surrounded by
weddings and happy brides,

08:44.830 --> 08:46.380
-it must be driving him crazy.
-

08:46.380 --> 08:49.500
Sir, we just got a report
that a third bride-to-be went missing.

08:50.500 --> 08:52.670
Madison Mills, 25,
from Tampa, Florida,

08:52.670 --> 08:55.080
was celebrating at a bar
with her bridesmaids last night,

08:55.080 --> 08:56.420
when she disappeared,

08:56.420 --> 08:57.750
she's supposed to get married
next Sunday.

08:57.750 --> 08:59.040
The first victim was three months ago,

08:59.040 --> 09:00.540
the second two days ago,
and now Madison.

09:00.540 --> 09:01.830
He's accelerating.

09:01.830 --> 09:04.500
He may be a townie
trolling bars to meet women.

09:04.500 --> 09:07.080
What if he interacted with them
and they turned down his advances?

09:07.080 --> 09:09.040
He could have felt emasculated,
thus triggering his rage.

09:09.040 --> 09:11.040
I'll see if there's any connection
between the brides-to-be.

09:11.040 --> 09:13.750
And, Garcia, look for men living in
the area with violent criminal records.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.580
Also any men
who were recently engaged

09:15.580 --> 09:17.620
and any who've had
the engagements broken off.

09:17.620 --> 09:18.960
Check for cold feet. Got it.

09:18.960 --> 09:21.210
So, how do we know Madison
didn't hook up with a guy at a bar?

09:21.540 --> 09:23.330
I mean, she could
still be sleeping it off

09:23.330 --> 09:24.920
and just doesn't want
to face her friends.

09:24.920 --> 09:26.380
We should check into that.
In the meantime, Morgan,

09:26.380 --> 09:28.880
you and Lewis
retrace the victim's last steps.

09:28.880 --> 09:30.420
Reid, go to the ME, and
Dave and I will go to the PD

09:30.420 --> 09:31.710
and talk to the families.

09:36.750 --> 09:40.000
SAVANNAH, GEORGIA

09:45.880 --> 09:47.790
Captain, I'm Agent Hotchner,
this is Agent Rossi.

09:47.790 --> 09:50.790
Glad you're here. I started coordination
with local media like you asked.

09:50.790 --> 09:52.830
Great. Madison's parents,
are they here yet?

09:52.830 --> 09:54.290
Their plane just landed.
I sent a cruiser over

09:54.290 --> 09:55.500
to pick them up from the airport.

09:55.790 --> 09:58.290
What about the bridal party?
They were the last ones to see her.

09:58.290 --> 10:00.960
Yeah, the maid of honor,
Kelly Goodwin, she's on her way in.

10:00.960 --> 10:03.670
The other bridesmaids
are back at the hotel if you need them.

10:03.670 --> 10:04.880
This way.

10:06.250 --> 10:08.250
Ashley Wilcox, cause of death,

10:08.250 --> 10:10.120
asphyxiation caused by strangulation.

10:10.620 --> 10:12.170
Her head was wrapped postmortem.

10:12.170 --> 10:13.670
Were you able to get anything
out of the sash?

10:13.920 --> 10:16.290
Some trace DNA.
We're running it through CODIS.

10:16.290 --> 10:19.420
The ligature marks show hesitation
on the part of the killer.

10:19.420 --> 10:21.460
He pulled the sash
tight across her neck

10:21.460 --> 10:24.000
and then released it several times
before she died.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.580
It could be the UnSub's way
of torturing his victims,

10:26.580 --> 10:28.290
or he's reluctant to kill.

10:28.290 --> 10:30.460
This looks like it was caused by
some sort of heavy object.

10:30.460 --> 10:33.710
I'm thinking a flashlight
or a lead pipe, perhaps.

10:33.710 --> 10:36.500
-That's what I was thinking.
-Any sign of sexual assault?

10:36.500 --> 10:40.540
No. The first victim, Brandy Green,
died instantly from the blow to her head,

10:40.540 --> 10:42.670
but the killer took more time
with Ashley.

10:43.000 --> 10:46.420
The UnSub could be impotent,
and choking his victims

10:47.420 --> 10:49.330
is how he satiates his urges.

10:49.710 --> 10:51.620
The press-on nails
on that hand are missing,

10:51.620 --> 10:53.290
probably ripped off in the struggle.

10:53.670 --> 10:55.460
The nails have been bitten off.

10:55.460 --> 10:58.500
Maybe Ashley bit her nails
before she was tortured?

10:58.500 --> 11:01.830
Nail-biting's an unsanitary habit,
but pretty common.

11:01.830 --> 11:04.170
True, but it's still considered
an impulse control disorder.

11:04.170 --> 11:07.420
It's often associated with
other body focus repetitive behaviors

11:07.420 --> 11:10.250
such as skin picking, skin biting,
and trichotillomania.

11:10.250 --> 11:13.000
But, in this case,
I think there's more to it than that,

11:13.000 --> 11:16.120
because the nails haven't been bitten
underneath the press-on nails.

11:16.790 --> 11:19.540
-Are you testing the saliva

11:19.540 --> 11:22.040
I'm thinking
the UnSub bit Ashley's nails.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.790
I've seen some freaky stuff in my day,
but never this.

11:27.670 --> 11:29.460
He most likely has
some sort of mental disorder.

11:30.120 --> 11:31.250
I'll say.

11:35.670 --> 11:39.170
When Madison didn't come back,
I went outside to see if she was sick.

11:39.170 --> 11:40.620
We were drinking a lot.

11:40.620 --> 11:43.120
But you couldn't find her.
Did you try her cell?

11:43.120 --> 11:45.540
She didn't answer.
It went right to voicemail.

11:46.290 --> 11:48.580
We thought maybe
she went back to the hotel.

11:48.580 --> 11:51.120
But this morning
when she still didn't come back...

11:51.460 --> 11:53.040
That was when you called the police?

11:53.880 --> 11:55.960
And this all happened at
The Wolf and the Rose?

11:55.960 --> 11:57.040
Yes.

11:57.750 --> 12:00.620
Okay, Kelly, would you be willing
to try something

12:00.620 --> 12:03.000
that could help us find out
what else you might remember?

12:03.460 --> 12:05.170
Anything, if it will help find Maddie.

12:07.540 --> 12:08.960
I want you to close your eyes.

12:12.920 --> 12:14.000
Okay, good.

12:14.750 --> 12:16.380
Now think back to last night.

12:17.380 --> 12:19.120
Think about the sounds,

12:19.380 --> 12:22.540
smells, the textures you experienced.

12:24.040 --> 12:26.420
What's the first thing you noticed
when you walked in the door?

12:27.670 --> 12:29.920
-The smell of stale beer.
-

12:29.920 --> 12:31.170
And it was noisy.

12:31.670 --> 12:33.880
I had to shout to be heard
over the talking and music.

12:34.670 --> 12:36.750
I kept getting bumped
because it was so crowded.

12:38.420 --> 12:39.620
But I didn't care.

12:40.670 --> 12:43.250
We were all having fun,
especially Maddie.

12:43.250 --> 12:44.620
I'm getting married, bitches!

12:46.880 --> 12:48.580
People were buying us drinks.

12:49.080 --> 12:50.420
They were happy for her.

12:51.120 --> 12:52.500
So was I.

12:53.880 --> 12:56.250
Was there anybody
trying to get close?

12:56.250 --> 12:58.210
Anybody making you
feel uncomfortable?

12:58.210 --> 12:59.670
No. No one.

13:00.750 --> 13:01.960
Wait.

13:02.460 --> 13:03.670
There was someone.

13:04.210 --> 13:06.000
I know who you girls are.

13:06.290 --> 13:08.290
I had just asked
the DJ to play a song.

13:08.290 --> 13:09.880
I was walking back to Maddie.

13:09.880 --> 13:11.460
This guy was yelling at her.

13:11.460 --> 13:12.880
What was he saying?

13:12.880 --> 13:14.120
Don't lie!

13:14.120 --> 13:16.080
I couldn't really hear.
It didn't make sense.

13:16.080 --> 13:17.500
What did he look like?

13:17.500 --> 13:18.540
Um...

13:19.040 --> 13:20.880
White, light hair...

13:21.920 --> 13:24.710
-I'm not real sure.
-Did Madison know him?

13:25.210 --> 13:27.580
When I asked,
she said he was just some drunk.

13:28.920 --> 13:31.500
-You think he took Maddie?
-We don't know.

13:31.500 --> 13:32.710
But we're gonna get
you and your friends

13:32.710 --> 13:33.920
to look at some mug shots, okay?

13:37.460 --> 13:40.460
Can I go back to the hotel now?
I think I'd like to lay down.

13:40.460 --> 13:41.920
Yeah, sure.

13:42.540 --> 13:45.080
Thank you, Kelly. You did really great.

13:56.710 --> 13:58.790
So, maybe our UnSub likes a challenge?

13:58.790 --> 14:00.920
He wants a woman who's
the center of everyone's attention?

14:00.920 --> 14:04.000
Well, we know how he got Madison,
but how did he get Brandy and Ashley?

14:07.880 --> 14:09.460
Hey, talk to me, sweet stuff.

14:09.460 --> 14:13.250
So, diving into local arrest records,
one name keeps popping up.

14:13.250 --> 14:14.540
Karl Ulrich.

14:14.540 --> 14:17.750
He lays asphalt for a living,
and here's where the plot thickens

14:17.750 --> 14:19.540
like a viscous, creepy soup.

14:19.880 --> 14:23.000
Three months ago
his fiancée left him at the altar

14:23.000 --> 14:25.790
and he has gone off
the deep end ever since.

14:31.500 --> 14:33.330
Sit down, Karl.

14:35.960 --> 14:38.920
Well, you've got
quite the reputation here.

14:38.920 --> 14:40.580
Public intoxication,

14:40.580 --> 14:42.500
trespassing, harassing women...

14:42.960 --> 14:46.120
You've been kicked out
of most every bar in town,

14:46.120 --> 14:49.040
the latest being
The Wolf and the Rose, last night.

14:49.290 --> 14:50.790
I wasn't bothering nobody.

14:50.790 --> 14:52.080
I was just being friendly.

14:52.620 --> 14:56.250
With a young woman
named Madison Mills.

14:57.210 --> 14:58.790
She's getting married next week.

14:59.620 --> 15:01.210
That's my problem how?

15:01.880 --> 15:03.500
She went missing last night.

15:04.580 --> 15:06.880
Well, hey, I don't know nothin'
about that.

15:06.880 --> 15:09.790
Maybe the bitch changed her mind
about the guy and took off.

15:10.210 --> 15:12.920
Like your former fiancée Stacy?

15:14.290 --> 15:16.670
She left you three months
before your wedding.

15:16.670 --> 15:19.000
Wow. That must have
really pissed you off.

15:20.460 --> 15:22.080
Nah. It's all good.

15:22.500 --> 15:25.750
Really? Because you violated
a restraining order

15:25.750 --> 15:27.250
she took out against you.

15:28.710 --> 15:30.790
I went over there to get my ring back.

15:34.670 --> 15:37.380
Where did you go last night
after The Wolf and the Rose?

15:37.380 --> 15:39.620
-Went out with some buddies.
-Where?

15:40.170 --> 15:42.420
To an all-night diner on Bay Street.

15:43.620 --> 15:45.420
Check it out if you don't believe me.

15:46.170 --> 15:48.580
Oh, we will.

16:04.420 --> 16:07.710
I'd say take a picture, it lasts longer,
but I'm the photographer.

16:10.710 --> 16:12.170
Hey, that's really beautiful.

16:14.250 --> 16:15.920
-You're a real artist.
-Really?

16:15.920 --> 16:16.960
Yeah.

16:18.790 --> 16:21.210
-Come on, smile.
-Oh, no, Ryan, not me.

16:21.210 --> 16:23.710
-Say "Limburger."
-No, stop.

16:23.710 --> 16:25.500
Hey, what's going on?

16:26.250 --> 16:28.540
Oh, your sister and I
are having a little fun.

16:29.080 --> 16:31.500
Great news.
The Georgia Women's Association

16:31.500 --> 16:33.500
accepted our bid to do the flowers
for its fundraising gala.

16:33.920 --> 16:35.790
-That is great.
-Awesome, Nicole.

16:35.790 --> 16:38.960
It's gonna be a lot of work,
but it'll really raise our profile.

16:38.960 --> 16:40.920
And, Ryan, they loved your work

16:40.920 --> 16:42.420
and they want you
to do the photography.

16:42.420 --> 16:44.000
-Terrific.
-Of course they did.

16:44.330 --> 16:46.330
-How could anyone resist you?
-

16:46.330 --> 16:48.000
You're gonna give me a big head.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.210
I've been on the phone all day.

16:49.210 --> 16:51.500
How about we go grab some coffee
at Jumping Java?

16:52.170 --> 16:55.460
-Dana, you want some?
-Um... Uh, no, I'm good.

16:55.460 --> 16:57.120
-We'll only be about an hour.
-Yeah.

17:13.380 --> 17:16.670
You know there's nothing
going on between me and your sister.

17:16.670 --> 17:18.830
It's all an act so I can be closer to you.

17:19.580 --> 17:21.710
Really

17:22.170 --> 17:23.750
Have I ever lied to you?

17:25.460 --> 17:27.540
You know who the real threat
to our love is.

17:29.790 --> 17:31.460
And what you have to do.

18:18.920 --> 18:20.290
All night, huh?

18:20.830 --> 18:22.380
All right, mama. Thanks.

18:22.670 --> 18:26.380
-Captain, you can release Karl Ulrich.
-I thought he looked good for it.

18:26.380 --> 18:27.830
When I showed him Madison's photo,

18:27.830 --> 18:30.290
he had absolutely no
cognitive reaction to her.

18:30.290 --> 18:32.000
And his alibi checks out.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.040
Karl's a creepy dude and
he definitely has issues with women,

18:34.040 --> 18:35.330
but he's not our UnSub.

18:35.330 --> 18:36.830
So, we're back to no suspects.

18:37.620 --> 18:39.920
Madison's been gone 15 hours now,

18:40.460 --> 18:42.330
longer than any of the other women.

18:42.330 --> 18:44.620
We still have no idea
how Madison and the UnSub

18:44.620 --> 18:46.540
crossed paths before
The Wolf and the Rose.

18:46.540 --> 18:48.620
If we can figure out
where he first saw her,

18:49.290 --> 18:50.880
we may still save her.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.830
-I don't think I can do it.
-You did it before.

18:57.080 --> 19:00.330
-I know, but I...
-You saw how she was flirting with me.

19:00.330 --> 19:03.290
Touching my arm,
begging me to come for a drink.

19:03.290 --> 19:05.790
Well, maybe she was just being nice.

19:05.790 --> 19:07.620
No, she's a slut.

19:08.710 --> 19:10.120
She wants me in her bed.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.620
-I thought you loved me, Dana.
-Of course I do.

19:18.330 --> 19:19.500
See?

19:20.670 --> 19:22.790
This is you and me
at our 7th grade dance.

19:26.620 --> 19:28.420
That's when I knew I loved you.

19:28.420 --> 19:30.670
Then you must protect
the purity of our love.

19:32.250 --> 19:33.880
Do what has to be done.

19:46.330 --> 19:47.880
I'm sorry.

19:48.500 --> 19:50.580
You only have yourself to blame.

19:55.330 --> 19:58.120
Baby girl, you there?-Speak now or forever hold your peace.

19:58.120 --> 20:00.750
Listen, Reid thinks that our UnSub
may have a mental illness.

20:00.750 --> 20:02.960
Run that against your list
of local men with records.

20:02.960 --> 20:05.290
Domestic disputes, peeping,
public intoxication.

20:05.290 --> 20:06.670
And check to see if
any have been released

20:06.670 --> 20:09.170
from public or private mental
health institutions within the area.

20:11.670 --> 20:13.290
Bingo, five names.
Sending them now.

20:17.330 --> 20:19.460
A man
walking his dog found her.

20:19.460 --> 20:21.080
Why change dump sites now?

20:21.080 --> 20:23.830
The UnSub could have figured
a dumpster downtown was too risky.

20:24.580 --> 20:27.290
She's got a gash on the side
of her head like the others.

20:28.830 --> 20:30.170
And look at this.

20:32.500 --> 20:33.750
Is that lipstick?

20:33.750 --> 20:35.670
By wrapping and marking
Madison's face,

20:35.670 --> 20:37.210
the UnSub's taking away her beauty.

20:37.210 --> 20:38.670
And by choosing the word slut,

20:38.670 --> 20:40.670
the UnSub's commenting
on Madison's virtue.

20:40.670 --> 20:43.540
Virtue and beauty are traditionally
celebrated attributes in women.

20:43.540 --> 20:45.710
That's especially true
for a bride or a bride-to-be.

20:47.380 --> 20:50.500
-The UnSub is female.
-How do you figure that?

20:50.500 --> 20:53.120
Three female victims,
no sign of sexual assault,

20:53.120 --> 20:55.710
and the victims were all strangled,
but not manually.

20:55.710 --> 20:58.330
And the word slut,
written here in lipstick,

20:58.330 --> 21:00.830
is linguistically a word choice
typically made by females.

21:00.830 --> 21:02.960
All right, it's time
to deliver the profile.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.750
We believe the unknown
subject we're looking for

21:05.750 --> 21:08.460
is a white woman
in her late 20s to early 30s.

21:08.460 --> 21:12.250
Because she was able to subdue,
control, transport, and dispose

21:12.250 --> 21:15.330
of the three victims,
she's most likely large and strong.

21:15.330 --> 21:17.080
But she comes across
as non-threatening,

21:17.080 --> 21:19.500
allowing her to get close
to her victims before attacking them.

21:19.500 --> 21:21.330
We should be interviewing
wedding vendors.

21:21.330 --> 21:22.920
They may have come in contact
with this woman.

21:22.920 --> 21:25.920
This list obviously includes
caterers, florists,

21:25.920 --> 21:27.830
photographers, wedding planners,

21:27.830 --> 21:29.830
hotel managers,
and bridal shop workers.

21:30.290 --> 21:33.880
And even though brides-to-be
seem to be the only targets right now,

21:33.880 --> 21:36.330
it's important that
everyone take precautions.

21:36.330 --> 21:37.830
We need you to pay attention.

21:37.830 --> 21:40.000
Be aware of your surroundings
and do not go out alone.

21:40.380 --> 21:42.330
If you're in a group, stay in a group.

21:42.330 --> 21:44.500
And if you happen to be drinking,
then be smart about it,

21:44.500 --> 21:45.920
let somebody else drive for you.

21:45.920 --> 21:48.460
Is she making a statement
about the institution of marriage?

21:48.460 --> 21:49.790
Because of her poor self-image,

21:49.790 --> 21:52.210
as evidenced by the demeaning
language and the nail-biting,

21:52.210 --> 21:54.580
we believe she is angry
with these brides-to-be

21:54.580 --> 21:56.750
because of some romantic frustration
or disappointment

21:56.750 --> 21:58.080
in her own life.

21:58.080 --> 22:00.750
She's most likely lashing out
over something or someone

22:00.750 --> 22:02.330
she feels she'll never have.

22:02.620 --> 22:04.000
She attacks with
a level of violence

22:04.000 --> 22:05.790
that demonstrates this is personal.

22:05.790 --> 22:07.380
She may be jealous of her victims

22:07.380 --> 22:09.540
for having something that
she desperately wants for herself.

22:10.500 --> 22:11.620
Thank you.

22:12.710 --> 22:14.460
I love to watch you sleep.

22:16.710 --> 22:20.210
Oh, I must have fallen asleep
waiting for you.

22:21.210 --> 22:22.500
I'm here now.

22:23.670 --> 22:24.960
I did what you asked.

22:25.250 --> 22:27.120
That girl won't bother you any more.

22:27.120 --> 22:28.420
Bother us.

22:29.040 --> 22:30.290
You did the right thing.

22:30.580 --> 22:31.790
Really?

22:32.460 --> 22:33.670
Absolutely.

22:37.460 --> 22:39.880
Dana, you in here?

22:41.710 --> 22:43.210
Dana, are you okay?

22:44.880 --> 22:46.330
There, that's better.

22:47.170 --> 22:48.710
It's a gorgeous day.

22:49.710 --> 22:51.710
Could go for a walk around the lake.

22:55.670 --> 22:58.420
Remember when we were little,
we'd stay out all day

22:58.420 --> 22:59.580
till it was dark.

23:00.670 --> 23:02.830
Mom would stand on the lawn
calling our names.

23:03.210 --> 23:05.080
The only way she'd get us
to come home

23:05.080 --> 23:06.710
was by bribing us with ice cream.

23:10.420 --> 23:13.380
What do you say about
going back to see Dr. Gorman?

23:14.380 --> 23:16.420
-I don't need to.
-I could come with.

23:16.420 --> 23:17.580
I'm fine.

23:17.580 --> 23:19.580
Dana, you're sleeping a lot.

23:20.120 --> 23:22.710
And locking yourself away
in your basement workshop,

23:22.710 --> 23:23.880
it's not good.

23:24.960 --> 23:27.500
And all this online shopping,
sweetie, I'm worried.

23:28.500 --> 23:30.040
You taking your medication?

23:31.540 --> 23:34.380
I told you already, I don't need to.

23:34.380 --> 23:35.580
I'm fine.

23:36.790 --> 23:37.960
Okay.

23:38.830 --> 23:40.080
Sorry.

23:42.670 --> 23:45.830
Hey, Ryan wants to take you and me
out tonight to Lombardi's

23:45.830 --> 23:47.120
for a special dinner.

23:48.420 --> 23:49.880
-He does?
-Uh-huh.

23:49.880 --> 23:51.080
He said special?

23:51.880 --> 23:54.420
Why don't you take a shower
and put on something nice?

23:54.750 --> 23:56.580
-Okay.
-Great.

24:02.580 --> 24:04.420
What can you tell us, Garcia?

24:04.420 --> 24:07.080
That the stress and pressure
of planning the perfect wedding

24:07.080 --> 24:08.920
is enough to drive anyone bonkers.

24:08.920 --> 24:11.210
Garcia, you find any connection
between the wedding vendors

24:11.210 --> 24:12.460
-and the three victims?
-Oh, yeah.

24:12.460 --> 24:15.830
Brandy, Ashley, and Madison
all went to the same 30 vendors,

24:15.830 --> 24:19.000
one of which does a horse-drawn
pumpkin carriage.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.790
I mean, come on. I need that in my life.

24:20.790 --> 24:22.420
Anyway, I talked to all the vendors

24:22.420 --> 24:25.290
and none of them remember
a large, strong, non-threatening woman

24:25.290 --> 24:26.880
who was recently dumped by her fiancé

24:26.880 --> 24:28.380
so she had to cancel all of her plans.

24:28.380 --> 24:30.380
They said they'd definitely
remember a customer like that.

24:30.960 --> 24:32.790
But what if the UnSub
didn't visit one of the vendors?

24:32.790 --> 24:34.290
What if she is one of the vendors?

24:34.290 --> 24:35.790
That's a more statistically probable way

24:35.790 --> 24:38.080
that the UnSub could come in contact
with all the victims.

24:38.080 --> 24:40.080
If she had a relationship
that ended badly,

24:40.080 --> 24:42.880
dealing with happy brides every day
could fuel her anger.

24:42.880 --> 24:44.920
Garcia, see if any of the vendors
fit the profile

24:44.920 --> 24:46.500
and if any have been recently divorced.

24:46.500 --> 24:48.210
Asketh and you shall receiveth.

24:48.580 --> 24:51.460
If she's attacking brides-to-be
because she was in a bad relationship

24:51.460 --> 24:54.540
or one didn't go as she hoped,
then she's most likely depressed.

24:54.540 --> 24:56.170
Yeah, but in my experience,
depressed women

24:56.170 --> 24:58.710
don't display this level of violence
towards others.

24:58.710 --> 25:01.460
Even if the depression's so severe,
it leads to psychosis?

25:06.000 --> 25:07.540
The red one.

25:13.880 --> 25:16.000
-I can't do this anymore.
-What's wrong?

25:16.750 --> 25:20.540
This. This sneaking around,
hiding our love.

25:21.290 --> 25:22.580
We should be together.

25:24.540 --> 25:25.710
You're right.

25:26.250 --> 25:27.540
No more hiding.

25:28.920 --> 25:30.960
Tonight at dinner, you and I
are going to tell your sister

25:30.960 --> 25:32.290
and the world about us.

25:33.040 --> 25:35.750
-You promise?
-I promise.

25:43.960 --> 25:45.380
Is it fresh?

25:46.250 --> 25:47.580
It's hot.

25:47.580 --> 25:49.000
Thank you.

25:50.580 --> 25:52.170
You're, uh...

25:52.170 --> 25:53.250
You're not wearing your ring.

25:53.670 --> 25:54.920
Pardon?

25:54.920 --> 25:57.460
Your engagement ring.
You are engaged, aren't you?

25:57.460 --> 26:00.580
I mean, you just seem to know
a lot about planning a wedding,

26:00.580 --> 26:02.790
and there's an indentation
on your ring finger.

26:03.380 --> 26:05.420
You got me.

26:05.790 --> 26:09.380
Uh, yeah, I just don't like
wearing my ring on the job.

26:10.250 --> 26:12.330
Your fiancé, is he in our line of work?

26:12.330 --> 26:14.670
Douglas. He's an environmental lawyer.

26:14.670 --> 26:16.420
Oh, he's one of the good guys.

26:16.420 --> 26:18.330
Yeah, he is. I guess I got lucky.

26:20.380 --> 26:21.500
But?

26:22.330 --> 26:25.290
-It's complicated.
-Oh, hey, when is it never complicated?

26:26.120 --> 26:28.290
Well, what does your upcoming
wedding tell you about this UnSub?

26:29.880 --> 26:33.250
Uh, well, here's something.
I don't know why this is,

26:33.250 --> 26:35.580
but ever since Douglas
and I got engaged,

26:36.080 --> 26:38.380
women seem
way more flirtatious with him.

26:38.750 --> 26:41.790
And they'll do it when I'm sitting
right there next to him.

26:41.790 --> 26:43.290
It drives me nuts.

26:43.290 --> 26:44.790
I don't think you need to worry
about all that stuff.

26:44.790 --> 26:45.960
-Just let it go.
-Yeah.

26:46.750 --> 26:48.790
But we don't think
this UnSub is engaged.

26:48.790 --> 26:50.460
No, but here's why I bring it up.

26:50.710 --> 26:52.670
What if she's in love with a guy that is?

26:55.670 --> 26:57.580
When I moved back home
six months ago,

26:57.580 --> 27:00.290
I never imagined that
I'd be sitting here tonight

27:00.290 --> 27:02.080
with you two beautiful women.

27:03.830 --> 27:05.670
At first, working together every day

27:05.670 --> 27:07.880
rekindled the friendship
that we had as kids.

27:07.880 --> 27:12.000
But that friendship blossoms,
forgive the pun,

27:12.580 --> 27:14.540
-into love.
-Yes.

27:15.580 --> 27:17.380
So, tonight,

27:18.080 --> 27:21.920
in front of your sister and
a roomful of strangers,

27:22.670 --> 27:24.290
I need to ask...

27:30.290 --> 27:32.880
Nicole, will you marry me?

27:34.250 --> 27:35.290
Yes.

27:36.710 --> 27:38.380
Yes!

27:40.750 --> 27:41.790
Baby...

27:44.960 --> 27:46.500
Congratulations!

27:56.170 --> 27:57.380
Okay, let's add it up.

27:57.380 --> 27:59.080
We may have a wedding vendor

27:59.080 --> 28:01.170
who is in love with someone
who doesn't love her back

28:01.170 --> 28:02.420
or who might be engaged.

28:02.420 --> 28:04.290
And she's probably severely depressed

28:04.290 --> 28:06.460
because of her physical
and emotional state.

28:06.460 --> 28:08.620
Assuming she's under a doctor's care,
she might be off her meds.

28:08.620 --> 28:11.790
-Nail-biting can be a symptom of that.
-

28:11.790 --> 28:14.460
-What's up, Garcia?
-I found several female vendors

28:14.460 --> 28:16.960
who went through a divorce,
but none in the past six months.

28:16.960 --> 28:18.880
Do any of them have
a history of depression?

28:18.880 --> 28:20.500
Nah. Zilch. Sorry.

28:20.500 --> 28:22.670
What about women whose
family members or loved ones

28:22.670 --> 28:24.250
recently got engaged?

28:24.250 --> 28:25.580
Hey, here's something.

28:25.580 --> 28:28.670
There's a local woman, Nicole Seavers,

28:28.670 --> 28:31.620
who, according to social media,
just got engaged last night.

28:31.880 --> 28:34.040
Here's her Instagram post.

28:34.040 --> 28:36.920
She owns a flower shop, Blossoms,

28:36.920 --> 28:40.040
and her new fiancé happens to be
a wedding photographer

28:40.040 --> 28:43.210
named Ryan Becker,
working out of said shop.

28:46.790 --> 28:48.750
She doesn't have the physicality
to be the UnSub.

28:48.750 --> 28:50.620
But the UnSub could be
someone close to Nicole.

28:50.620 --> 28:52.460
Garcia, we need to look
at people in Nicole's

28:52.460 --> 28:54.000
immediate circle of family and friends.

29:00.250 --> 29:01.460
It's not the way, Dana.

29:01.460 --> 29:03.960
You lied. You proposed to Nicole.

29:03.960 --> 29:05.960
I had to. But it's all part of the game.

29:05.960 --> 29:07.880
We just have to keep playing it
a little while longer,

29:07.880 --> 29:09.290
then we can be together.

29:09.290 --> 29:11.620
Wait, so you don't
want to marry my sister?

29:12.120 --> 29:14.710
She tricked me,
like those other girls tried to.

29:15.210 --> 29:17.380
I love you, Dana. It's always been you.

29:18.710 --> 29:20.250
Remember our first dance,

29:20.790 --> 29:23.170
how it felt to be in each other's arms?

29:27.460 --> 29:29.710
It was like we were the only two people
on the dance floor.

29:31.000 --> 29:32.830
I knew then that you were my destiny,

29:33.750 --> 29:35.920
and we'd be together forever.

29:43.580 --> 29:46.000
You know who the real threat
to our happiness is.

29:47.120 --> 29:48.830
Oh, no. No, I can't.

29:49.290 --> 29:51.210
Yes. You know what she did.

29:52.710 --> 29:53.920
Yes.

29:57.250 --> 29:58.830
Do I really have to?

29:59.750 --> 30:01.120
Do it for us.

30:05.880 --> 30:07.040
For us.

30:11.290 --> 30:12.330
Oh...

30:13.420 --> 30:15.000
Oh, dear.

30:15.380 --> 30:16.420
Oh...

30:16.880 --> 30:18.790
You guys, you guys, uh, Nicole Seavers

30:18.790 --> 30:21.670
inherited the flower shop
from her mother, who died a year ago.

30:21.670 --> 30:24.290
Her older sister Dana Seavers
also works there.

30:24.290 --> 30:26.790
So, the mom left the shop
to only the one daughter?

30:26.790 --> 30:28.120
Well, that must have hurt Dana.

30:28.120 --> 30:30.580
-Is the father in the picture?-No. He left when they were little.

30:30.580 --> 30:32.420
This is the part of the story
that is disturbing

30:32.420 --> 30:34.080
and sad at the same time.

30:34.080 --> 30:36.420
So, you know how Nicole and Ryan
got engaged last night?

30:36.420 --> 30:39.670
Well, three months ago,
Dana set up a wedding registry.

30:39.670 --> 30:41.790
She must have known in advance
about her sister getting engaged.

30:41.790 --> 30:43.710
Maybe the boyfriend enlisted her help.

30:43.710 --> 30:45.960
No, the wedding registry
isn't for Nicole and Ryan,

30:45.960 --> 30:48.920
it's for Dana and Ryan, and
according to Dana's credit cards,

30:48.920 --> 30:50.880
she's been buying stuff
off the wedding registry

30:50.880 --> 30:52.210
and sending them to herself.

30:52.210 --> 30:54.380
Okay, so she must be
suffering from psychosis,

30:54.380 --> 30:57.120
confusing what is real
with her own little fantasy world.

30:58.250 --> 31:01.250
This isn't just psychosis.
This is a psychotic delusion

31:01.250 --> 31:02.710
based on Ryan Becker.

31:02.710 --> 31:04.380
And then when another woman
threatens that delusion,

31:04.380 --> 31:06.080
she suffers a psychotic break.

31:06.330 --> 31:08.500
Dana's sister Nicole
got engaged to Ryan,

31:08.500 --> 31:10.580
which means,
Nicole is Dana's next victim.

31:10.580 --> 31:13.500
Garcia, we need addresses
for the floral shop and for both sisters.

31:13.500 --> 31:15.710
Dana and Nicole both live
above the flower shop. Sending now.

31:15.710 --> 31:16.880
Thanks.

31:31.380 --> 31:32.750
Morgan.

31:41.790 --> 31:42.830
Clear!

31:43.710 --> 31:44.750
Clear!

31:51.620 --> 31:52.750
Clear!

32:05.830 --> 32:07.080
Look at this place.

32:07.080 --> 32:09.420
Clutter or the constant presence
of a messy room

32:09.420 --> 32:11.210
is often a sign of depression.

32:14.500 --> 32:15.960
"Mr. and Mrs. Ryan Becker.

32:15.960 --> 32:18.170
"Mrs. Dana Becker.
Dana and Ryan Becker."

32:18.830 --> 32:22.790
She'd created a checklist
for her life together with Ryan.

32:22.790 --> 32:26.330
Farmhouse, a chocolate lab,
and two kids named Megan and Jake.

32:26.330 --> 32:28.500
Look at this, Bupropion.
It's an antidepressant.

32:28.500 --> 32:31.460
This was dispensed six months ago,
but the bottle's still full.

32:33.040 --> 32:34.420
TriNessa.

32:35.210 --> 32:36.380
Metformin.

32:36.670 --> 32:38.210
Spironolactone?

32:38.210 --> 32:39.830
That's an interesting
combination of meds.

32:39.830 --> 32:41.960
Those are typically used
to treat a hormone imbalance.

32:41.960 --> 32:44.670
It sounds to me like Dana has
polycystic ovaries syndrome.

32:44.670 --> 32:48.210
It can cause obesity, excess
hair growth, acne, and depression.

32:48.210 --> 32:50.580
PCOS is fairly common
in teen girls and young women.

32:50.580 --> 32:52.920
It sadly affects one in 10 women
of reproductive age.

32:52.920 --> 32:54.540
The good news is it's treatable.

32:54.540 --> 32:56.000
Okay, but it's PCOS.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.170
-It didn't turn Dana into a killer.
-I'm not saying that.

32:58.170 --> 33:01.710
I'm just saying it might have contributed
to her becoming depressed.

33:04.790 --> 33:06.670
Dana's registry gifts.

33:10.620 --> 33:12.710
I'd say she's kind of obsessed with him.

33:17.170 --> 33:19.920
-No kidding.
-We need to find Ryan Becker.

33:22.750 --> 33:25.000
Anything upstairs to tell us
where she might have taken Nicole?

33:25.500 --> 33:27.920
Nothing, but if Nicole is engaged
to Dana's true love,

33:27.920 --> 33:29.120
Dana could go over the edge.

33:29.120 --> 33:30.290
We don't have a lot of time.

33:30.290 --> 33:33.500
African violets,
Chinese hibiscus, roses,

33:33.500 --> 33:35.000
lilies, and orchids.

33:35.000 --> 33:36.330
What are you thinking, kid?

33:36.750 --> 33:38.080
They're all fresh flowers,

33:38.080 --> 33:40.460
but in order for all these varieties
to thrive in this climate,

33:40.460 --> 33:42.920
-they'd need a controlled environment.
-They've got a greenhouse.

33:42.920 --> 33:44.830
Dave, you and Reid stay here
in case they come back.

33:55.250 --> 33:57.880
-You're just like all the others!
-Dana, what's wrong?

33:57.880 --> 33:59.960
-I thought you were different.
-What are you talking about?

33:59.960 --> 34:02.210
Ryan. You can't marry him.

34:02.210 --> 34:04.540
Dana, calm down.
I was just as surprised as you were...

34:04.540 --> 34:06.210
No, this isn't how it's supposed to go.

34:06.210 --> 34:07.580
-How what's supposed to...
-He promised!

34:07.880 --> 34:10.040
-Why are you doing this?
-I won't let you take him away from me.

34:10.290 --> 34:13.290
-Dana, stop. You're hurting me.
-You leave me no choice!

34:13.290 --> 34:15.710
You're upset. I am going to text Ryan

34:15.710 --> 34:17.830
and ask him to come here
so we can all chat, okay?

34:17.830 --> 34:19.170
Ryan's mine!

34:19.170 --> 34:20.330
You slut!

34:25.670 --> 34:27.080
With Nicole and Ryan getting married,

34:27.080 --> 34:30.040
Dana probably feels that everyone
she's ever loved has abandoned her.

34:30.040 --> 34:32.330
First her father and mother
and now her sister and Ryan.

34:33.170 --> 34:34.540
Part of me actually feels sorry for her.

34:34.540 --> 34:36.920
Nicole's got everything
Dana's ever wanted for herself.

34:36.920 --> 34:38.460
Love and affection from a man.

34:49.420 --> 34:51.290
If only you'd have
stayed away from him.

34:53.670 --> 34:54.880
Dana?

34:56.540 --> 34:57.790
What's going on?

34:58.620 --> 35:01.290
-Why are you dressed like that?
-Today's my wedding day.

35:02.120 --> 35:03.290
What?

35:05.000 --> 35:06.620
Ryan and I are getting married.

35:08.420 --> 35:09.960
Oh, honey, no.

35:11.040 --> 35:12.460
-You're not.
-Yes.

35:13.040 --> 35:14.250
He loves me.

35:15.620 --> 35:17.460
Of course he does. But like a sister.

35:17.880 --> 35:19.460
-My sister.
-No.

35:20.500 --> 35:22.040
He was my boyfriend first.

35:22.920 --> 35:25.080
You two dated one summer
in middle school.

35:25.080 --> 35:26.540
That's all.

35:26.540 --> 35:29.120
-This whole love affair is in your mind.
-You're wrong.

35:30.500 --> 35:31.830
Just wait and see.

35:49.080 --> 35:51.080
All right, thanks, sweetness.

35:51.080 --> 35:52.580
Garcia just tracked Ryan's phone.

35:52.580 --> 35:54.040
He just arrived at the greenhouse.

35:54.040 --> 35:55.670
-She talk to him?
-He didn't pick up.

35:55.670 --> 35:57.000
She also saw a text from Nicole

35:57.000 --> 35:59.460
asking him to meet her
at the greenhouse ASAP.

35:59.460 --> 36:01.920
He's probably walking into
Dana's psychotic fantasy.

36:05.080 --> 36:07.880
I'm not angry, okay? Just untie me.

36:09.330 --> 36:10.710
We're sisters.

36:11.210 --> 36:13.380
And sisters always look out
for one another, right?

36:14.040 --> 36:15.500
She's trying to trick you.

36:16.080 --> 36:17.330
But she's my sister.

36:17.580 --> 36:19.620
She'll never stop trying
to take me away from you.

36:20.330 --> 36:21.620
I don't want to hurt her.

36:22.210 --> 36:23.750
You're not talking to anyone.

36:24.120 --> 36:26.580
-There's no one there.
-Don't listen to her.

36:28.040 --> 36:30.290
-You do all this for me?
-Yes.

36:31.170 --> 36:33.170
-Do you like it?
-It's perfect.

36:33.710 --> 36:34.880
Dana?

36:35.120 --> 36:36.420
Your sister can be our witness.

36:37.420 --> 36:38.830
Then you know what you have to do.

36:38.830 --> 36:40.580
Nicole, where are you?
I got your text.

36:42.330 --> 36:43.580
-What the...
-Ryan!

36:43.880 --> 36:44.960
Help me.

36:46.710 --> 36:47.750
No!

36:48.710 --> 36:50.420
Don't come any closer.

37:02.250 --> 37:03.790
Dana, why are you doing this?

37:04.120 --> 37:06.880
-She's sick, Ryan. She needs help.
-You said I had to.

37:06.880 --> 37:08.710
You said this was the only way
we could be together.

37:09.880 --> 37:11.830
Dana, put the knife down.

37:13.420 --> 37:16.120
Don't you see?
She'll try to take him away from me.

37:16.880 --> 37:19.210
And Nicole now understands
that that would be wrong.

37:19.920 --> 37:21.250
Don't you, Nicole?

37:22.920 --> 37:24.040
Yes.

37:24.460 --> 37:25.620
Yes.

37:25.920 --> 37:27.330
I'm so sorry, Dana.

37:29.120 --> 37:30.460
Lower your weapons, everyone.

37:32.460 --> 37:34.580
-But this is crazy. Dana tried...
-No, no.

37:35.120 --> 37:36.710
Dana, you love Ryan.

37:38.290 --> 37:40.000
But you also love your sister.

37:42.920 --> 37:44.210
We know you're sad, Dana,

37:44.210 --> 37:47.250
but hurting Nicole
is not gonna make that go away.

37:49.250 --> 37:50.460
You're right.

37:51.420 --> 37:52.620
It won't.

37:55.710 --> 37:56.880
Oh, my God, Dana, don't.

37:57.620 --> 37:59.380
Ryan, tell her you love her, right now.

38:00.040 --> 38:01.920
Dana, I love you.

38:03.460 --> 38:05.670
-I do.
-I knew it.

38:07.080 --> 38:08.790
You came back for me.

38:09.460 --> 38:10.620
Yeah.

38:12.580 --> 38:13.830
Nicole,

38:14.920 --> 38:16.380
I know you would never
stand in the way

38:16.380 --> 38:17.960
of your sister's happiness, would you?

38:18.830 --> 38:19.920
No.

38:21.250 --> 38:23.960
Ryan, it's over between us.

38:24.790 --> 38:26.380
You love Dana and always have.

38:27.830 --> 38:28.880
Yeah.

38:30.170 --> 38:31.290
Dana,

38:32.120 --> 38:35.250
you and Ryan can finally be together
like you were meant to be.

38:39.290 --> 38:40.750
Meant to be.

39:54.080 --> 39:55.830
Alfred, Lord Tennyson wrote,

39:55.830 --> 39:58.290
"I hold it true, whate'er befall,

39:58.830 --> 40:00.750
"I feel it, when I sorrow most,

40:01.540 --> 40:03.420
"'Tis better to have loved and lost

40:04.040 --> 40:06.170
"Than never to have loved at all."

40:10.960 --> 40:12.750
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

40:13.380 --> 40:15.210
Wow, so, that's where the sun went.

40:15.880 --> 40:17.580
-Nice rock.
-Thank you.

40:20.330 --> 40:22.830
Uh-oh. Trouble in paradise?

40:23.500 --> 40:26.290
Uh, no. I love him.
I really do. It's just, um...

40:27.170 --> 40:28.620
You know, this job makes things...

40:29.170 --> 40:31.380
-Complicated

40:31.960 --> 40:33.290
Relationships.

40:34.580 --> 40:36.170
You're not the only one, Tara.

40:37.080 --> 40:40.080
So, Morgan, when are you and
Savannah walking down the aisle?

40:40.080 --> 40:42.710
Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa,
baby steps. Baby steps.

40:42.710 --> 40:45.880
When Derek Morgan says "I do"
it'll be a national day of mourning

40:45.880 --> 40:47.250
for single women everywhere.

40:48.580 --> 40:50.750
Just don't elope.

40:51.380 --> 40:52.540
Wow.

40:52.540 --> 40:55.120
-Sounds like there's a story there.
-Oh, there is.

40:57.710 --> 41:01.920
I married the third ex Mrs. Rossi at a
drive-in wedding chapel in Las Vegas.

41:02.670 --> 41:05.710
I had an Elvis impersonator
perform the ceremony.

41:05.710 --> 41:07.580
You're kidding.
-Wait for it.

41:08.500 --> 41:11.040
I'm playing 21. I've got a streak going,

41:11.040 --> 41:12.830
I can't lose even if I try.

41:13.670 --> 41:14.880
Krystall's the dealer.

41:15.750 --> 41:17.500
One thing leads to another...

41:18.040 --> 41:19.920
I should have known it wouldn't last.

41:19.920 --> 41:22.380
Krystall spelled her name
with a "K" and two "Ls".

41:24.580 --> 41:29.080
We sobered up the next morning,
the divorce was just as quick.

41:30.580 --> 41:32.580
I will never make that mistake again.

41:32.580 --> 41:34.250
What, get married,
or have the King of Rock and Roll

41:34.250 --> 41:35.710
as your justice of the peace?

41:36.420 --> 41:37.670
Both.

41:37.670 --> 41:39.250
Thank you very much.
