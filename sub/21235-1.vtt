follow me this way onto the quad,</i>

00:31.217 --> 00:32.715
we'll continue our campus tour.

00:32.717 --> 00:34.485
So, sweetie,
remember, if you drink a beer,

00:34.487 --> 00:35.920
you drink a glass of water, all right?

00:35.922 --> 00:38.321
Six-pack of beer,
six-pack of water.

00:38.323 --> 00:40.957
Okay. This just sounds
like way too much liquid.

00:40.959 --> 00:42.793
Or just don't party at all.

00:42.795 --> 00:44.695
Okay, Mom, you're the
one who always talks about

00:44.697 --> 00:46.597
how much you smoked pot in college

00:46.599 --> 00:48.564
and for a whole semester,
you just peed outside.

00:48.566 --> 00:50.067
Okay, they did call me,

00:50.069 --> 00:52.302
"Smoke a Lot of Pot and Pee Outside" Kate.

00:52.304 --> 00:53.970
- Well...
- But I regret that.

00:53.972 --> 00:56.006
Okay? Just skip over that
part and act like I am now.

00:56.008 --> 00:58.375
- Okay.
- Oh. Let's show her stranger danger.

00:58.377 --> 00:59.543
Do you know stranger danger?

00:59.545 --> 01:01.143
I'm sure...

01:01.145 --> 01:03.446
Okay, this is real important.
So, I'm a scary frat guy.

01:03.448 --> 01:04.513
- <i>Right?</i>
- Okay.

01:04.515 --> 01:05.749
<i>There's a lot of them.</i>

01:05.751 --> 01:07.718
- Mom is you, all right?
- Lucky me.

01:07.720 --> 01:10.087
<i>Okay. Hey, sweet thing.</i>

01:10.089 --> 01:12.221
- My name's Geppetto. Uh...
- Whoa.

01:12.223 --> 01:14.724
- 'Cause I make the ladies my puppets.
- Uh...

01:14.726 --> 01:16.659
- Yeah. Right?
- See? I already don't trust him.

01:16.661 --> 01:18.361
- Right? He's a bad guy.
- Trust your instincts.

01:18.363 --> 01:19.962
- Bad guy.
- Weird choice.

01:19.964 --> 01:21.498
<i>So, you wanna
come up to the bro house?</i>

01:21.500 --> 01:22.965
You don't have to answer.

01:22.967 --> 01:24.768
- Oh...
- But, for this scenario, I will.

01:24.770 --> 01:26.736
I'm fine, thank you. I'm
getting ready to study.

01:26.738 --> 01:28.971
<i>Oh, but I like the silent type.</i>

01:28.973 --> 01:30.741
You smell good.

01:30.743 --> 01:32.709
<i>You probably think I'm close to
you, but I'd like to get closer.</i>

01:32.711 --> 01:34.712
<i>♪ Come, my lady
Come, come, my lady</i>

01:34.714 --> 01:36.245
<i>♪ You're my sugar
pie, honey, baby ♪</i>

01:36.247 --> 01:38.015
Then you elbow him in the
balls, and then you roll away.

01:38.017 --> 01:39.915
Right there. And you roll.

01:39.917 --> 01:41.584
- And the guy's like, "No! My nards."
- And you get out of there.

01:41.586 --> 01:43.554
So, stay away from guys named Geppetto.

01:43.556 --> 01:45.489
Got it. Thank you. Guys...

01:45.491 --> 01:48.726
I love this school. This is
where I wanna go next year.

01:48.728 --> 01:51.028
Oh, we're so happy you love it here!

01:51.030 --> 01:53.329
Let us come with you!

01:53.331 --> 01:54.734
- She's just kidding.
- Nah.

01:56.200 --> 01:57.334
I love you guys.

01:57.336 --> 01:58.668
- We love you, too.
- Come here.

01:58.670 --> 02:00.738
Aw... God, our little baby!

02:00.740 --> 02:02.539
If I get in.

02:02.541 --> 02:04.007
- If you get in.
- If you get in.

02:04.009 --> 02:06.576
- That's right.
- Tough school. It's tough.

02:06.578 --> 02:08.110
Oh, God. No, I don't wanna click it.

02:08.113 --> 02:09.747
I'm not gonna click it. One
of you click it. I'm not...

02:09.749 --> 02:12.216
Honey, Alex, you're an A student, okay?

02:12.218 --> 02:13.750
<i>Chill. I'm sure you got in.</i>

02:13.752 --> 02:15.752
You know, if they don't
want my baby, they're stupid.

02:15.754 --> 02:18.754
The Bisons? What kind of mascot is that?

02:18.756 --> 02:21.358
If they say no to you,
I say we say no to them.

02:21.360 --> 02:22.692
Fuck the Bisons! You know.

02:22.694 --> 02:24.964
- Yeah. Bucknell, more like Fucknell!
- Yes!

02:28.367 --> 02:29.966
I got in!

02:31.469 --> 02:33.705
You got in! Yes!

02:36.676 --> 02:40.046
Bucknell, I knew it! I knew it! I knew it!

02:41.580 --> 02:43.046
We're Bucknell!

02:43.048 --> 02:44.847
- Bucknell, baby! Bucknell!
- Yeah! Bucknell!

02:44.849 --> 02:48.720
It's a majestic creature,
the bison. Bisons! Bisons!

02:58.262 --> 03:01.799
Man, Frank is not looking
so hot since Raina left.

03:01.801 --> 03:03.901
<i>Ugh, I can smell
that poncho from here.</i>

03:03.903 --> 03:05.536
He looks like Animal from the Muppets.

03:05.538 --> 03:06.804
- What's up, you guys?
- What's up, buddy? How are ya?

03:06.806 --> 03:08.271
- Guys.
- Frank, buddy.

03:08.273 --> 03:09.406
Great party!

03:09.408 --> 03:10.674
Yeah, it's going great, huh?

03:10.676 --> 03:11.675
Yeah, we're glad you could come.

03:11.677 --> 03:13.409
You made it.

03:13.411 --> 03:16.045
Yeah, of course I made it.
Rode my bike all the way here.

03:16.047 --> 03:17.313
- Good.
- Yeah.

03:17.315 --> 03:18.414
What happened to your car?

03:18.416 --> 03:20.651
I can't find it.

03:20.653 --> 03:22.352
You guys must be pretty psyched, right?

03:22.354 --> 03:23.687
Yeah, we are.

03:23.689 --> 03:24.988
So proud of Alex. She's really grown up.

03:24.990 --> 03:27.024
No, no, no. I'm talking about us.

03:27.026 --> 03:29.092
I'm talking about the three
of us, next week. Vegas!

03:29.094 --> 03:30.593
- We were thinking about Vegas.
- Yeah.

03:30.595 --> 03:32.530
What if we push Vegas until the fall?

03:32.532 --> 03:35.232
Yeah. We still go. We just
push it a little later.

03:35.234 --> 03:37.567
No. There's only now.
There is no later, right?

03:37.569 --> 03:38.869
We'll... We'll talk.

03:38.871 --> 03:40.569
All right, buddy. All right.

03:40.571 --> 03:42.171
Guys, high school's over.

03:42.173 --> 03:44.108
And, let's face it, we're
not ready for college.

03:44.110 --> 03:46.242
It seems like being a freshman in college

03:46.244 --> 03:48.377
means you have to be prepared
to get date raped, right?

03:48.379 --> 03:51.381
I don't understand the difference
between, like, rape and date rape.

03:51.383 --> 03:55.551
Oh, I think date rape is when you go
to dinner and a movie, and then rape.

03:55.553 --> 03:58.054
- She's talking to her friends about how sad she is.
- Yeah.

03:58.056 --> 03:59.588
Look at their body language.

03:59.590 --> 04:01.792
They don't want to leave their parents.

04:01.794 --> 04:03.994
We're gonna pack everything we should
have done at high school into this summer.

04:03.996 --> 04:06.462
I mean, I kind of told my parents
I'd hang out with them this summer.

04:06.464 --> 04:09.466
- That's weird.
- No, my parents are fun.

04:09.468 --> 04:10.867
For parents, they're fun.

04:10.869 --> 04:12.336
For people, they're the worst. I...

04:12.338 --> 04:14.006
Does your mom even talk to you, Rachel?

04:14.839 --> 04:16.105
Stop.

04:16.107 --> 04:18.074
How did we get so lucky
to snag a kid like that?

04:18.076 --> 04:19.375
I don't know.

04:19.378 --> 04:21.644
Kind of feel like
I'm losing my best friend.

04:21.647 --> 04:25.414
Gotten so used to it being us three.

04:25.416 --> 04:28.553
What's it gonna be like
when it's just us?

04:31.822 --> 04:34.357
Well, it's gonna...

04:34.359 --> 04:35.624
Come on!

04:35.626 --> 04:37.393
I mean, yeah!

04:37.395 --> 04:38.928
Empty nest?

04:38.930 --> 04:41.631
This nest is gonna be
filled with our loving.

04:41.633 --> 04:42.965
- Yes!
- Yeah!

04:42.967 --> 04:44.568
It's gonna be a regular
fuck fest around here.

04:44.570 --> 04:47.572
Oh, yeah! Get your passport ready,

04:48.974 --> 04:50.806
'cause we're...

04:50.808 --> 04:52.844
We'll be going to fuck town.

04:55.580 --> 04:56.847
What a nice party.

04:56.849 --> 04:58.549
Hey, thank you so much for the party.

04:58.551 --> 05:00.484
<i>- Oh, you're welcome.</i>
- It was really fun.

05:00.486 --> 05:02.352
I had such a good time.

05:02.354 --> 05:04.787
Rachel invited me over
to her house tonight,

05:04.789 --> 05:06.789
and I was wondering if I could go.

05:06.791 --> 05:08.792
Well, we were gonna
watch <i>Walking Dead.</i>

05:08.794 --> 05:10.393
What's more fun,
hanging with your friends,

05:10.395 --> 05:12.796
or watching zombies eat
people with your parents?

05:12.798 --> 05:15.532
Think it's time for an Alex sandwich?

05:15.534 --> 05:17.866
Mmm.

05:17.868 --> 05:19.503
Please stay, please stay.

05:19.505 --> 05:22.006
Stay, stay, stay.

05:22.008 --> 05:25.876
- Okay. Okay, I'll stay.
- Yes.

05:28.447 --> 05:30.813
- Brains.
- Brains.

05:30.815 --> 05:33.150
Oh, no! Oh, no!

05:33.152 --> 05:34.551
Brains.

05:36.522 --> 05:37.787
Whoa!

05:37.789 --> 05:39.155
- Oh, my God!
- Oh!

05:40.226 --> 05:41.592
<i>All right, town.</i>

05:41.594 --> 05:43.559
<i>We'd now like to open up
the floor to its citizens.</i>

05:43.561 --> 05:45.061
<i>First up on the docket,</i>

05:45.063 --> 05:47.666
<i>Council would like to
recognize Officer Chandler.</i>

05:48.601 --> 05:50.232
<i>Good afternoon.</i>

05:50.234 --> 05:54.470
<i>Last Tuesday night at
approximately 3:14 a.m.,</i>

05:54.472 --> 05:57.808
<i>vandals spray-painted what
appears to be a male penis</i>

05:57.810 --> 06:00.844
<i>and accompanying genitalia</i>

06:00.846 --> 06:02.712
<i>on the high school football field.</i>

06:02.714 --> 06:04.847
<i>It has since been removed.</i>

06:04.849 --> 06:06.349
<i>All right.</i>

06:06.351 --> 06:08.619
<i>Town would like to
recognize Frank Theodorakis.</i>

06:08.621 --> 06:10.953
<i>$1,500 of fines</i>

06:10.955 --> 06:13.892
<i>for the height of my hedges.</i>

06:14.560 --> 06:16.126
<i>This is bullshit, Bob.</i>

06:16.128 --> 06:17.393
<i>Screw this town.</i>

06:17.395 --> 06:19.862
<i>I am out of here.
Right after I say this.</i>

06:19.864 --> 06:21.998
<i>Raina, baby, please come home.</i>

06:22.000 --> 06:23.833
- <i>You're my wife.</i>
- Oh, God.

06:23.835 --> 06:25.801
<i>- I love you, and I want you to come home.
- Frank, shut up. Stop it.</i>

06:25.803 --> 06:27.970
<i>This is the only time I can
be in the same room with you.</i>

06:27.972 --> 06:29.505
- <i>Come home!</i>
- Just not here!

06:29.507 --> 06:31.640
It's not going the
way you think it's going.

06:31.642 --> 06:33.277
<i>I want it, but I've gotta turn
this around. Raina, just...</i>

06:33.279 --> 06:35.078
- Stop it. Go. Just...
<i>- Oh, come on!</i>

06:35.080 --> 06:36.880
<i>And where the
hell is our car, Frank?</i>

06:36.882 --> 06:38.280
<i>Well, looks like
Fox Meadow's having</i>

06:38.282 --> 06:39.816
<i>its own little soap
opera play out here.</i>

06:39.818 --> 06:41.018
I'm sorry.

06:41.020 --> 06:42.553
<i>No need to apologize to us.</i>

06:42.555 --> 06:44.854
<i>Just apologize to yourself
for making a bad decision.</i>

06:44.856 --> 06:46.289
<i>On a bad man.</i>

06:46.291 --> 06:49.292
<i>Moving on to the next issue.</i>

06:49.294 --> 06:51.828
<i>If we could, please.
Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

06:51.830 --> 06:54.597
<i>Fox Meadow's most exciting project,</i>

06:54.599 --> 06:55.935
<i>the town pool!</i>

07:00.505 --> 07:02.005
What?

07:02.007 --> 07:03.772
<i>The actual pool
will be five pools,</i>

07:03.774 --> 07:06.042
<i>picnic area, playground,</i>

07:06.044 --> 07:08.111
<i>state-of-the-art
locker room,</i>

07:08.113 --> 07:11.580
<i>and the best food court
in the tri-state area.</i>

07:11.582 --> 07:13.583
<i>All right, the last item</i>

07:13.585 --> 07:15.852
<i>on today's agenda is 207-G,</i>

07:15.854 --> 07:18.054
<i>that is the Fox Meadow Scholarship,</i>

07:18.056 --> 07:20.390
<i>rewarding one hardworking
high school student...</i>

07:20.392 --> 07:22.191
This is us. He's talking about us.

07:22.193 --> 07:24.061
<i>...by paying their college tuition.</i>

07:24.063 --> 07:26.763
<i>This year's recipient is none
other than Alex Johansen.</i>

07:26.765 --> 07:28.765
- Alex Johansen.
- Alex... Yes!

07:28.767 --> 07:30.400
<i>Unfortunately, the town is facing</i>

07:30.402 --> 07:32.402
<i>some devastating
budget cuts this year</i>

07:32.404 --> 07:35.138
<i>and I'm afraid the
scholarship is an indulgence</i>

07:35.140 --> 07:37.907
<i>that the town can no longer afford.</i>

07:41.613 --> 07:42.912
<i>All right, so if that is
it, then we can move on.</i>

07:42.914 --> 07:44.780
- Hold on, please.
- Bob...

07:44.782 --> 07:47.049
Are you saying that you don't
have money for the scholarship,

07:47.051 --> 07:49.953
but you have money for the town pools?

07:49.955 --> 07:53.090
<i>Look, I would love to give
Alex this scholarship.</i>

07:53.092 --> 07:55.124
<i>Heck, I'd love to give
everybody a free education.</i>

07:55.126 --> 07:57.361
<i>So, let's open it up to the town.</i>

07:57.363 --> 08:00.330
<i>By a show of hands, who
here likes swimming?</i>

08:01.834 --> 08:03.099
No, wait.

08:03.101 --> 08:04.934
- No, don't raise your hands.
- Oh, come on.

08:04.936 --> 08:07.503
That's not what we're debating
here. It's a trick question.

08:07.505 --> 08:10.672
I guess I'm a little torn
here, to be quite honest,

08:10.674 --> 08:12.876
'cause I do love Alex.

08:12.878 --> 08:14.710
But I also love swimming.

08:14.712 --> 08:15.845
Shut up, Joe.

08:15.847 --> 08:18.147
I love swimming. I'm Martha.

08:18.149 --> 08:19.982
<i>'Cause, you know, with
three kids and a job,</i>

08:19.984 --> 08:21.719
it's the only me time I get.

08:21.721 --> 08:22.986
Of course you want the pool, Martha.

08:22.988 --> 08:24.386
It's right next to your house.

08:24.388 --> 08:26.590
You know what Laura brings to a potluck?

08:26.592 --> 08:28.390
Her nasty mouth and no more.

08:28.392 --> 08:30.227
How was I supposed to know that
I was supposed to bring food?

08:30.229 --> 08:32.229
<i>That invitation was vague.</i>

08:32.231 --> 08:34.097
And you don't have to keep telling
everyone your name's Martha, they know.

08:34.099 --> 08:35.965
But that's who I am, I'm Martha.

08:35.967 --> 08:37.600
<i>All right, ladies, enough, enough.</i>

08:37.602 --> 08:39.001
<i>Let's bring this to a vote.</i>

08:39.004 --> 08:41.436
<i>Those in favor of
eliminating the scholarship</i>

08:41.438 --> 08:44.107
<i>and building the
town pool, vote yes.</i>

08:44.110 --> 08:46.944
<i>Those opposed, who want
one family to profit</i>

08:46.946 --> 08:49.812
<i>while the rest of
the town suffers, no.</i>

08:49.814 --> 08:51.214
<i>Yes?</i>

08:51.216 --> 08:53.016
<i>All right, looks like
the yeses have it.</i>

08:53.018 --> 08:54.386
Oh, please.

09:00.024 --> 09:05.762
I'll tell you one thing I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna take a hate crap in that pool.

09:05.764 --> 09:08.431
<i>We can barely afford
our mortgage, and now this?</i>

09:08.433 --> 09:10.667
It's time we face the
truth, we're bad parents.

09:10.669 --> 09:12.902
Remember that mother who
threw her baby down a well?

09:12.904 --> 09:14.336
We're worse than that mother.

09:14.338 --> 09:17.873
You know, when I became
a dad, I made a choice.

09:17.875 --> 09:20.910
To be the dad my father wasn't. Right?

09:20.912 --> 09:22.211
To play with my daughter,

09:22.213 --> 09:24.714
to support her dreams and talents,

09:24.716 --> 09:28.151
and, yeah, maybe I could
have spent a little more time

09:28.153 --> 09:30.720
checking on what was in the bank.

09:30.722 --> 09:34.190
But instead, I put my heart in the bank.

09:34.192 --> 09:37.826
I deposited love, a lot of it.

09:37.828 --> 09:42.532
And that's not gonna be the cover
story of <i>The Wall Street Journal,</i>

09:42.534 --> 09:45.868
but it's the headline of my heart.

09:45.870 --> 09:48.271
- Does that make sense?
- No, honey, I lost you halfway through.

09:48.273 --> 09:51.941
Okay, the bottom line is that Alex thinks
we can afford tuition, and we can't.

09:51.943 --> 09:53.542
We need to tell her the truth.

09:53.544 --> 09:55.777
We always tell the truth.
That's what we always say.

09:55.779 --> 09:56.812
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

09:56.814 --> 09:59.048
I think we should do it.

09:59.050 --> 10:00.883
- I'm not gonna do it.
- Me neither.

10:00.885 --> 10:03.253
We gotta lie about everything,
because that's what parents do.

10:03.255 --> 10:05.154
The job of being a parent, number one job,

10:05.156 --> 10:07.290
is to keep this crazy shit from their kids.

10:07.292 --> 10:10.692
'Cause otherwise, the kids are gonna realize
that we don't know what we're doing!

10:10.694 --> 10:12.296
- Exactly, that's what our parents did!
- Yeah.

10:12.298 --> 10:14.163
My dad had cancer and never told us!

10:14.165 --> 10:16.066
And what you didn't know, didn't hurt you.

10:16.068 --> 10:19.067
It was weird. But I got over it.

10:19.069 --> 10:20.970
And then he died, so...

10:20.972 --> 10:23.306
- Yeah.
- Hey, guys.

10:23.308 --> 10:24.272
Hi.

10:24.274 --> 10:27.109
I heard about the scholarship.

10:27.111 --> 10:30.714
So, I guess I can't go to Bucknell.

10:30.716 --> 10:32.816
You're going to Bucknell University.

10:32.818 --> 10:34.783
<i>- We're gonna send you there.
- Yeah. Yeah.</i>

10:34.785 --> 10:37.653
And if we can't keep the
promise that we make to you,

10:37.655 --> 10:40.322
we are the worst parents in the world.

10:40.324 --> 10:41.326
Oh, honey.

10:44.862 --> 10:46.595
Thank you guys so much.

10:46.597 --> 10:48.467
- I love you guys.
- Love you, too.

10:58.843 --> 11:02.011
<i>So, as you know, Bob
took away our scholarship,</i>

11:02.013 --> 11:03.513
which we were kind of counting on.

11:03.515 --> 11:06.081
But then we remembered
that we have a college fund

11:06.083 --> 11:09.018
with our dear financial advisor, Dawn.

11:09.020 --> 11:10.686
You don't have enough money.

11:10.688 --> 11:12.921
I don't have any money.

11:12.923 --> 11:14.224
Can I have a raise?

11:14.226 --> 11:17.127
No way. No earthly way.

11:17.129 --> 11:18.327
- I have an idea.
- Hmm?

11:18.329 --> 11:20.129
Can we apply for a loan?

11:20.131 --> 11:21.897
Listen, I'm just gonna
come right out with it.

11:21.899 --> 11:23.300
<i>No one's gonna lend you shit.</i>

11:23.302 --> 11:25.170
But if I don't get my job back...

11:28.106 --> 11:29.671
Are you jerking off a giant?

11:29.673 --> 11:30.974
No, I'm...

11:30.976 --> 11:33.209
I just hung... I just hanged myself.

11:33.211 --> 11:34.978
I don't know if you heard me.

11:34.980 --> 11:37.046
If you don't give me a raise,

11:37.048 --> 11:39.248
I'm walking out of this building

11:39.250 --> 11:40.849
and I'm not looking back.

11:40.851 --> 11:42.485
I don't believe you, and
I think you're bluffing.

11:42.487 --> 11:44.622
Is this the face of a man who's bluffing?

11:45.790 --> 11:47.623
Okay, right here.

11:47.625 --> 11:51.293
It says right here, in this
account, we have $401,000.

11:51.295 --> 11:53.596
- Jackpot!
- You missed it!

11:53.598 --> 11:57.135
No, uh, that says you have a 401K account.

11:59.904 --> 12:02.471
Look, we have to tell him
that we're not going to Vegas, okay?

12:02.473 --> 12:04.342
Yeah. There's no way we can go.

12:06.879 --> 12:08.878
Yikes.

12:08.880 --> 12:10.680
<i>- I'm not a loser.
- You are a loser!</i>

12:10.682 --> 12:12.415
- Frank? Where are you, bud?
<i>- I'm not a loser! No!</i>

12:12.417 --> 12:13.617
What do you want from me?

12:13.619 --> 12:15.752
What do you want from me?

12:15.754 --> 12:17.387
<i>- Sign the divorce papers, Frank!
- No, I don't wanna do...</i>

12:17.389 --> 12:18.955
What did I do to make you hate me so much?

12:18.957 --> 12:20.856
We should get out of here.
Give them their privacy.

12:20.858 --> 12:22.291
- Yep.
<i>- You punched my dad!</i>

12:22.293 --> 12:23.593
<i>He called m
a gambling addict!</i>

12:23.595 --> 12:25.261
- <i>You are a gambling addict.</i>
- Wow.

12:25.263 --> 12:27.296
You lost your job, and
you stopped showering.

12:27.298 --> 12:29.398
- We should go. She's coming.
- I know.

12:29.400 --> 12:31.569
Just sign the fucking
divorce papers, Frank.

12:31.970 --> 12:33.036
Oh.

12:33.038 --> 12:34.104
- Oh, hi.
- Hey.

12:34.106 --> 12:36.105
Hey, Raina, you look great.

12:36.107 --> 12:37.574
Oh, wow.

12:37.576 --> 12:38.675
That was crazy.

12:38.677 --> 12:40.210
Yeah, it was kind of weird.

12:40.212 --> 12:42.411
We don't really know. Yeah.

12:42.413 --> 12:44.483
He's your problem now.

12:50.856 --> 12:52.057
Hey, Frank?

12:54.659 --> 12:55.892
Hey, bud.

12:55.894 --> 12:57.496
Hey. Hey, guys.

12:58.463 --> 12:59.394
What's going on?

12:59.396 --> 13:01.763
- <i>I was fixing the sink.</i>
- Uh-huh.

13:01.765 --> 13:04.066
Splashed
some water on my face.

13:04.068 --> 13:06.768
- That's what's going on here.
- Mmm-hmm.

13:06.770 --> 13:09.239
'Cause I was fixing the sink
'cause the sink was broken.

13:09.241 --> 13:11.306
Right, it's okay. We saw Raina.

13:11.308 --> 13:15.144
I know my life seems totally awesome
and, like, things are going great, but...

13:15.146 --> 13:17.146
Hmm. It looks pretty bleak in here.

13:17.148 --> 13:20.050
Who am I kidding? I'm having
a pretty hard time right now.

13:20.052 --> 13:22.219
- We get that. Yeah.
- It seems like it. Yeah.

13:22.221 --> 13:25.153
Which is why I'm all in on this Vegas trip.

13:25.155 --> 13:28.325
That's the only thing that is
keeping me alive right now, frankly.

13:28.327 --> 13:30.627
So, let's get this party started!

13:30.629 --> 13:31.894
Right.

13:31.896 --> 13:33.229
You know...

13:33.231 --> 13:35.264
- I need it bad.
- We know you need it.

13:35.266 --> 13:37.566
- Yeah.
- But, for us, it's not a great time.

13:37.568 --> 13:39.301
So, we were thinking, maybe...

13:39.303 --> 13:41.037
Maybe...

13:41.039 --> 13:44.740
- We...
- We could leave later than we talked about leaving.

13:44.742 --> 13:49.211
- You said we were going to say...
- I said we have since...

13:49.213 --> 13:54.118
- You have since...
- ...decided that we need to support a friend.

13:55.187 --> 13:56.722
Who's this friend?

14:01.927 --> 14:04.127
Vegas. Whoo!

14:10.401 --> 14:12.200
<i>- It's 11! Eleven!</i>
- Yes! Yes!

14:12.202 --> 14:13.970
<i>Gentleman needs some chips.</i>

14:13.972 --> 14:15.904
Guys, what are you waiting for?

14:15.906 --> 14:20.008
Get in on this! I'm hitting every
single number over and over again.

14:20.010 --> 14:21.076
<i>Let's do this!</i>

14:21.078 --> 14:22.979
Dice are out!

14:22.981 --> 14:24.412
<i>Eleven!</i>

14:24.414 --> 14:26.316
<i>- This dude is on fire!</i>
- You guys need money?

14:26.318 --> 14:30.418
I am literally making every
single person at this table money.

14:30.420 --> 14:31.988
I don't know, we said
we weren't gonna gamble.

14:31.990 --> 14:34.157
Come on. What's the
worst that could happen?

14:34.159 --> 14:35.858
Maybe we put a few dollars on four.

14:35.860 --> 14:37.259
<i>Hot shooter.</i>

14:37.261 --> 14:39.461
I mean, yeah, the fourth
is Alex's birthday.

14:39.463 --> 14:41.129
- Right?
- We'll just do one bet.

14:41.131 --> 14:44.099
I kind of can't lose at
this point, so let's do this.

14:44.101 --> 14:45.468
<i>Welcome to the Wynn, sir.</i>

14:45.470 --> 14:47.369
Number four, please.

14:47.371 --> 14:49.207
- <i>No, no, not all 500.</i>
- Hey-oh!

14:51.375 --> 14:53.310
- Yeah! Fuck yeah, four!
- Yes! Yes!

14:53.312 --> 14:55.277
Four! Four!

14:55.279 --> 14:57.880
I should tell you, the probability
of hitting four again, very unlikely.

14:57.882 --> 15:02.018
But if we do, you guys are gonna
double that and it's gonna pay out big.

15:02.020 --> 15:03.518
And, plus, it's for baby Alex!

15:03.520 --> 15:07.223
- Alex! Alex! Alex!
- Alex! Alex! Alex!

15:07.225 --> 15:08.257
<i>That's a four.</i>

15:10.794 --> 15:13.296
Come on, Frank! Frank, look at me!

15:13.298 --> 15:15.264
- We're gonna do this, Frank!
- Here we go, Kate!

15:15.266 --> 15:17.032
- Do this!
- Let's do this!

15:17.034 --> 15:19.069
<i>♪ To my brothers and sisters</i>

15:19.071 --> 15:21.003
<i>♪ Mom, Pops, and my daughter</i>

15:21.005 --> 15:25.141
<i>♪ Nieces and nephews, salute
all y'all to those I can't get to</i>

15:25.143 --> 15:27.143
<i>♪ To my dogs on lock down</i>

15:27.145 --> 15:29.012
<i>♪ Block hustlers from all around</i>

15:29.014 --> 15:31.113
<i>♪ I pray you make it
This world is yours...</i>

15:31.115 --> 15:32.181
Four!

15:33.717 --> 15:37.152
<i>♪ Amazing, amazing,
amazing, so damn amazing ♪</i>

15:37.154 --> 15:39.021
<i>Okay, guys...</i>

15:39.023 --> 15:43.026
If I roll another four, that's
Alex going to college, all right?

15:43.028 --> 15:44.293
I feel very lucky right now.

15:44.295 --> 15:45.561
- We believe in you, Frank.
- All right.

15:45.563 --> 15:48.266
Whatever you do, don't roll a seven!

15:57.509 --> 16:00.408
Why would you say that?

16:00.410 --> 16:03.112
I didn't know!

16:03.114 --> 16:06.581
- No!
- No!

16:06.583 --> 16:11.052
Fuck you, asshole!

16:11.054 --> 16:13.625
No!

16:21.332 --> 16:23.231
<i>Yeah! Oh, yeah!</i>

16:23.233 --> 16:25.268
<i>Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!</i>

16:25.270 --> 16:27.603
<i>- Oh, no!
- God damn it!</i>

16:27.605 --> 16:30.038
<i>Seven out,
there was no four.</i>

16:30.040 --> 16:33.243
- Hey, that money's my daughter's college tuition.
<i>- Yeah?</i>

16:33.245 --> 16:36.311
Well, she just got accepted
to the School of Hard Knocks.

16:36.313 --> 16:37.580
Misroll! It's a misroll!

16:37.582 --> 16:39.882
- Scotty, no!
- I said not a seven!

16:39.884 --> 16:42.018
Give me that stick! Give it to me!

16:42.020 --> 16:44.019
"Whatever you
do, don't roll a seven"?

16:44.021 --> 16:46.556
Thanks a lot, asshole. You
basically jinxed us all.

16:46.558 --> 16:51.927
I was merely trying to make you
aware of what number not to roll,

16:51.929 --> 16:54.629
which, by the way, for
the record, was seven.

16:54.631 --> 16:56.999
<i>Fuck you, asshole!</i>

16:57.001 --> 16:58.368
That guy gets it!

16:58.370 --> 16:59.634
- Why is that guy following me?
- Why?

16:59.636 --> 17:01.437
Because he hates you.

17:01.439 --> 17:03.138
I hate you, too, right now.

17:03.140 --> 17:05.040
This place makes you crazy.

17:05.041 --> 17:08.644
You know, we came in hell-bent on
not gambling, and what did we do?

17:08.646 --> 17:10.345
We gambled and we lost all our money.

17:10.347 --> 17:12.181
You know what I say?

17:12.183 --> 17:13.516
House always wins.

17:13.518 --> 17:15.453
What if we were the house?

17:19.057 --> 17:20.823
<i>Are you guys
familiar with the cliche,</i>

17:20.825 --> 17:22.724
"It's a cliche because it's true"?

17:22.727 --> 17:26.394
Well, that cliche about cliches
being true has never been more true

17:26.396 --> 17:28.263
than right now with the cliche,

17:28.266 --> 17:30.266
"The house always wins."

17:30.268 --> 17:32.000
- What?
<i>- Okay?</i>

17:32.002 --> 17:33.803
Now, we stand to make

17:33.805 --> 17:37.406
<i>four years' tuition in one month.</i>

17:37.408 --> 17:40.075
<i>One month, guys. Think about that.</i>

17:40.077 --> 17:42.412
This is the most impressive
thing you've ever done, Frank.

17:42.414 --> 17:44.046
- Um...
- Thanks, Scott.

17:44.048 --> 17:46.681
- I'm very wary to go into business with you.
- Noted.

17:46.683 --> 17:49.919
- However, we know why we need the money.
- Yes.

17:49.921 --> 17:51.287
What's in it for you?

17:51.289 --> 17:53.623
Well, full disclosure, the
bank has foreclosed on my home.

17:53.625 --> 17:55.357
- Oh, Frank.
- Ah. There we go.

17:55.359 --> 17:57.427
<i>So, this money would
help me get that back.</i>

17:57.429 --> 17:58.760
That's pretty much why Raina left me.

17:58.762 --> 18:00.430
No, that's not why Raina left you.

18:00.432 --> 18:01.964
It's because you started
gambling on golf...

18:01.966 --> 18:03.699
- Yeah.
- <i>True. Well, not just golf, but okay.</i>

18:03.701 --> 18:05.902
And you developed an online porn addiction.

18:05.904 --> 18:08.604
Okay, it's not an addiction if you can
quit any time you want, which I can.

18:08.606 --> 18:10.873
- Then stop.
- I don't want to right now.

18:10.875 --> 18:14.110
Listen, I know I'm throwing a lot of
numbers at you guys, lot of financials.

18:14.112 --> 18:17.680
But let's not take away from the
fact that this is gonna be fun.

18:17.682 --> 18:19.681
Okay, but we're not
doing it for fun, right?

18:19.683 --> 18:21.518
- Eh...
- No, we aren't. No.

18:21.520 --> 18:24.386
- It's work.
- I think we're saying the same thing, all of us.

18:24.388 --> 18:26.288
Work hard, play hard. Everybody has fun.

18:26.290 --> 18:28.393
I think this slide will explain it.

18:29.293 --> 18:30.793
<i>Hey-oh!</i>

18:30.795 --> 18:32.795
<i>- Look at that!</i>
- Well, it just says "fun."

18:32.797 --> 18:34.764
<i>- It's fun.
- But it just says "fun."</i>

18:34.766 --> 18:38.268
Yeah, it's gonna be a great time,
probably the best time of our lives.

18:38.270 --> 18:41.237
And we're gonna make crazy money.

18:41.239 --> 18:43.405
The graphics are great, but
it doesn't help us. It doesn't.

18:43.407 --> 18:46.241
I have one last slide to show you,
and I think it's the most important.

18:46.243 --> 18:47.544
Check this out.

18:47.546 --> 18:49.446
<i>Look at Alex, right? Here she is.</i>

18:49.448 --> 18:51.581
<i>She's gone to college, Bucknell,</i>

18:51.583 --> 18:54.083
<i>top of her class,
built her own company.</i>

18:54.085 --> 18:58.354
If she doesn't go to college,
boom! She's a homeless prostitute.

18:58.356 --> 19:00.390
She's a runaway on the streets,

19:00.392 --> 19:03.258
selling her tiny body for money.

19:03.260 --> 19:06.528
I don't like this. This is
very emotionally manipulative.

19:06.530 --> 19:08.096
Yeah, exactly.

19:08.098 --> 19:09.964
- May I speak with you privately, please?
- Right now?

19:09.966 --> 19:12.201
Yes, I'd love to talk to you
in the kitchen, if I could.

19:12.203 --> 19:13.404
Okay.

19:17.408 --> 19:18.676
Well?

19:19.711 --> 19:21.743
Thumbs up, right?

19:21.745 --> 19:24.380
I mean, the math. It seems to check out.

19:24.382 --> 19:25.847
Do this math.

19:25.849 --> 19:27.615
You're 40 years old and
you go to jail for 20 years.

19:27.617 --> 19:28.784
How old are you when you get out?

19:28.786 --> 19:30.685
- Ninety. Hundred.
- No. Honey...

19:30.687 --> 19:34.222
- If I have some scratch paper, I can figure it out.
- Really fucking old!

19:34.224 --> 19:37.427
Besides, I don't wanna start
an illegal operation with...

19:37.429 --> 19:38.995
- Frank?
<i>- Yes!</i>

19:38.997 --> 19:41.163
- He's our best friend!
- No, he's your best friend.

19:41.165 --> 19:44.533
He's my long friend. We haven't
been friends since college.

19:44.535 --> 19:46.468
Besides, we promised Alex

19:46.470 --> 19:49.305
that we would spend time with
her before she went to college.

19:49.307 --> 19:52.141
But if we don't have the
money, she can't go to college.

19:52.143 --> 19:54.677
And then she's living
with us until she's 40,

19:54.679 --> 19:56.478
working as a banged-up cocktail waitress.

19:56.480 --> 19:58.814
She's gonna have tattoos with
weird guys' names on them.

19:58.816 --> 20:01.083
- She's gonna get a neck tattoo.
- Oh, my God.

20:01.085 --> 20:03.052
Of a hand trying to choke her.

20:03.054 --> 20:04.953
- That's gonna be Alex!
- I know. You don't think I know that?

20:04.955 --> 20:06.655
We need to figure this shit out!

20:06.657 --> 20:09.557
Can we pull this off? I
mean, can we run a casino?

20:09.559 --> 20:11.059
It's a shady business

20:11.061 --> 20:14.430
with criminals, mobsters,
you know, with shady people.

20:14.432 --> 20:16.332
Look, we tried to play it safe,

20:16.334 --> 20:20.303
we've tried to play by the
rules, and it got us nowhere.

20:20.305 --> 20:21.636
What do we have to lose?

20:21.638 --> 20:22.771
Nothing.

20:22.773 --> 20:25.508
So, what do you guys think?

20:25.510 --> 20:27.578
Let's take a risk for Alex.

20:29.548 --> 20:31.113
All right, fuck it, I'm in.

20:31.115 --> 20:32.414
- Yes!
- Yeah!

20:34.085 --> 20:36.085
<i>We'll do it here, my house.</i>

20:36.087 --> 20:39.456
<i>My hedges are crazy
high, so it's private.</i>

20:39.458 --> 20:41.324
<i>Plus, Raina took a
lot of the furniture,</i>

20:41.326 --> 20:44.360
<i>so we've got plenty
of room for tables.</i>

20:44.362 --> 20:46.095
<i>We need players. That's easy.</i>

20:46.097 --> 20:48.730
<i>There's Martha. Her
husband left her last year,</i>

20:48.732 --> 20:50.732
<i>and now she runs book club</i>

20:50.734 --> 20:53.502
<i>and tries to suppress the rage
bubbling just beneath the surface.</i>

20:53.504 --> 20:57.139
<i>There's Joe, retired at
30, taking care of his mom</i>

20:57.141 --> 20:59.807
<i>and bored out of his fucking mind.</i>

20:59.809 --> 21:01.177
<i>Then there's Reggie,</i>

21:01.179 --> 21:03.312
<i>who just made partner
at his law firm,</i>

21:03.314 --> 21:06.615
<i>which means he's got cash to
burn, but he's super stressed out.</i>

21:06.617 --> 21:08.684
<i>He needs to blow off steam.</i>

21:08.686 --> 21:11.754
<i>Now, remember, this is
an underground casino.</i>

21:11.756 --> 21:13.287
<i>We can't park outside my house,</i>

21:13.289 --> 21:16.092
<i>or everyone will know,
including the cops.</i>

21:16.094 --> 21:17.826
<i>Park at Taylor's,</i>

21:17.828 --> 21:20.268
<i>buy something and keep the receipt
to prove you're a customer.</i>

21:20.597 --> 21:22.064
<i>Don't attract attention.</i>

21:22.066 --> 21:24.366
<i>Remember, you're just
buying groceries.</i>

21:24.368 --> 21:27.536
<i>You're not on your way
to an illegal casino.</i>

21:27.538 --> 21:29.271
<i>Walk out to the back,
where the electrical wall</i>

21:29.273 --> 21:31.807
<i>and the wooden fence
meet by the woods.</i>

21:37.213 --> 21:38.579
<i>Ignore the sign.</i>

21:38.581 --> 21:39.984
<i>It's a decoy.</i>

21:40.751 --> 21:42.218
Got it.

21:42.220 --> 21:43.719
<i>Take the path
through the woods,</i>

21:43.721 --> 21:45.153
<i>bear left at the fourth tree,</i>

21:45.155 --> 21:47.192
<i>and boom, you're
right in my backyard.</i>

21:50.962 --> 21:52.495
<i>Go down the basement stairs,</i>

21:52.497 --> 21:54.796
<i>then knock three times
and give the password.</i>

21:54.798 --> 21:56.268
Andre the Giant.

21:58.035 --> 22:01.269
- Welcome.
- Frank!

22:01.271 --> 22:02.704
When we open this door,

22:02.706 --> 22:04.105
don't get confused.

22:04.107 --> 22:06.110
It's still just Frank's house.

22:08.279 --> 22:09.881
Ta-da!

22:12.383 --> 22:13.783
What do you guys think?

22:13.785 --> 22:16.451
I mean, am I in the Bellagio right now,

22:16.453 --> 22:19.755
or am I three blocks from my
house? I genuinely don't know.

22:19.757 --> 22:22.223
This is the best day of my entire life.

22:22.225 --> 22:24.759
Thumbs up. Pretty good.

22:24.761 --> 22:26.796
And we can gamble here for real money?

22:26.798 --> 22:29.464
This isn't like one of those charity
things where you think you're winning,

22:29.466 --> 22:32.300
but then you have to give it to
cancer research or some bullshit?

22:32.302 --> 22:33.902
You win it, you keep it.

22:33.904 --> 22:36.704
- Okay, you know what, fuck book club!
- Fuck book club!

22:36.706 --> 22:38.239
On these notes,

22:38.241 --> 22:40.710
let the games of chance begin!

22:40.712 --> 22:42.279
Yeah!

22:48.452 --> 22:50.219
All right, man.

22:50.221 --> 22:51.420
Hit me right now!

22:51.422 --> 22:52.822
Hit it!

22:52.824 --> 22:54.656
Hit it down right there!

22:54.658 --> 22:55.892
And I lost!

22:55.894 --> 22:58.260
All right! Mama like!

22:58.262 --> 23:00.962
<i>Now, we don't have
five years to make the money.</i>

23:00.964 --> 23:02.331
<i>We only have a month.</i>

23:02.333 --> 23:04.665
<i>So, we have to
reinvest our winnings.</i>

23:04.667 --> 23:09.071
<i>It's like I always say, "Back your
own horse, baby. Bet on yourself."</i>

23:09.073 --> 23:13.745
<i>We gotta invite everybody,
even Garvey and fucking Craig!</i>

23:16.748 --> 23:19.414
Oh, did I win? That's fun.

23:19.416 --> 23:22.218
I never played before. Isn't that funny?

23:22.220 --> 23:26.722
<i>Anybody been to that Burrito
Hut over on Fox Meadow Lane?</i>

23:26.724 --> 23:28.257
<i>Yeah, it's a nightmare.</i>

23:28.259 --> 23:30.625
<i>You can't even get a
burrito out of there.</i>

23:30.627 --> 23:32.828
<i>People are getting so involved,</i>

23:32.830 --> 23:34.962
<i>they had to put a spit guard up,</i>

23:34.964 --> 23:38.800
<i>because people kept falling
into the vegetables.</i>

23:38.802 --> 23:42.139
<i>"More corn! I want more corn!"</i>

23:53.684 --> 23:54.983
<i>So, where are we at?</i>

23:54.985 --> 23:57.185
All right.

23:57.187 --> 23:58.787
When all's said and done,

23:58.789 --> 24:00.791
we are...

24:01.392 --> 24:02.658
Down $3,500.

24:02.660 --> 24:04.594
- Yeah!
- Nice!

24:04.596 --> 24:06.295
- Wait.
- Up top!

24:06.297 --> 24:07.996
- Down?
- Wait...

24:07.998 --> 24:10.365
Listen, Reggie went on a streak,
that comedian was very expensive.

24:10.367 --> 24:13.368
We're lucky that Joe lost
that $1,000 bet at the end.

24:13.370 --> 24:15.805
If he hadn't, you know where we'd be then.

24:15.807 --> 24:17.906
- Mmm-mmm. Where would we be?
- Really?

24:17.908 --> 24:20.608
We'd be down $5,500. It's simple math.

24:20.610 --> 24:23.178
Math gives him anxiety,
numbers make him nervous.

24:23.180 --> 24:25.381
A lot of people, you
know, break out in sweats

24:25.383 --> 24:28.316
and have heart palpitations
when they hear numbers out loud.

24:28.318 --> 24:29.751
That's not true at all.

24:29.753 --> 24:31.353
But, you know what, let's
not worry about that.

24:31.355 --> 24:33.322
Let's just focus on the positives,

24:33.324 --> 24:36.825
which is, down $3,500 is a great start.

24:36.827 --> 24:39.761
- Ooh. Bucknell.
- Ooh. What's this?

24:39.763 --> 24:41.764
<i>50 million dollars?</i>

24:41.766 --> 24:43.101
<i>Thousand, honey.</i>

24:44.702 --> 24:45.968
Oh, God.

24:45.970 --> 24:48.002
- My butt just got so tight.
- Yeah.

24:48.004 --> 24:50.104
- Hey, what's that?
- Hey.

24:50.106 --> 24:51.373
- What?
- Nothing.

24:51.375 --> 24:52.807
Hey.

24:52.809 --> 24:54.476
We gotta get a bell on you.

24:54.478 --> 24:57.712
- Sneaking up on us like that.
- Yeah.

24:57.714 --> 25:01.717
And so that's why your mother
and I will be working late,

25:01.719 --> 25:05.254
uh, every night,

25:05.256 --> 25:09.858
and on weekends for all of next month.

25:09.860 --> 25:13.328
Because you're working on
a super top secret project

25:13.330 --> 25:15.730
that you may or may not reveal to me later.

25:15.732 --> 25:17.600
Mmm-hmm. Yes, exactly, you get it.

25:17.602 --> 25:20.835
No, but I don't get it.
You're just being weird.

25:20.837 --> 25:22.371
You're acting weird,

25:22.373 --> 25:25.341
with your shifty eyes
and your sketchy posture.

25:25.343 --> 25:26.642
Sorry.

25:26.644 --> 25:29.277
Doesn't feel good to be
called names, does it? Weirdo.

25:29.279 --> 25:31.713
I thought we'd hang out a lot this summer.

25:31.715 --> 25:33.348
Are we still going school shopping?

25:33.350 --> 25:36.117
Yes! Absolutely, we're
gonna do all of those things.

25:36.119 --> 25:39.622
- While you work every night until 3:00 a.m.?
<i>- You know what?</i>

25:39.624 --> 25:42.557
You're kind of acting
like a... Bitch.

25:42.559 --> 25:46.228
- What did you just say?
- I didn't say it.

25:46.230 --> 25:48.296
- I didn't vocalize it.
- Mom?

25:48.298 --> 25:51.700
If it walks like a duck and talks
like a duck, it's probably a...

25:51.702 --> 25:53.201
Bitch.

25:53.203 --> 25:54.769
You just said "bitch."
You just called me a bitch.

25:54.771 --> 25:56.438
Don't say that word.

25:56.440 --> 25:59.911
I just can't help but feel like you're lying.

26:02.379 --> 26:04.380
Oh, my God!

26:04.382 --> 26:07.181
This is what I wanted to show
you guys. Pretty beautiful, right?

26:07.183 --> 26:10.387
- Not really.
- It's Thomas Kinkade, Master of Light.

26:11.254 --> 26:12.821
- It's mesmerizing.
- Yeah.

26:12.823 --> 26:15.527
But it's, oh, so much more.

26:16.527 --> 26:17.562
- Oh!
- Whoa!

26:18.529 --> 26:20.328
Crafty hiding spot, Frank.

26:20.330 --> 26:22.730
Each of these safes holds 100 grand.

26:22.732 --> 26:27.268
I know, because I cut paper into
money-size stacks and I checked.

26:27.270 --> 26:29.538
It took an incredibly long time.

26:29.540 --> 26:33.275
Now, if we fill all five
safes, that's 500 grand.

26:33.277 --> 26:35.845
250 for you, 250 for me.

26:35.847 --> 26:37.412
You guys can put Alex through college,

26:37.414 --> 26:39.413
and I can get my life back on track.

26:39.415 --> 26:41.549
Let's fill these fucking safes.

26:45.655 --> 26:47.056
Wow.

26:47.058 --> 26:49.091
Looks like we got some
heavy action tonight.

26:49.093 --> 26:51.492
Yeah, Reggie winning was the best
thing that could have happened to us.

26:51.494 --> 26:54.262
People actually think they
can win money at this place.

26:54.264 --> 26:55.631
We're giving people hope.

26:55.633 --> 26:58.502
There's at least one, two, three, four...

27:00.404 --> 27:02.403
There's at least 800
people in here tonight.

27:02.405 --> 27:05.309
There are max 35 people in this room.

27:13.550 --> 27:15.150
<i>You got a 19!</i>

27:15.152 --> 27:17.385
<i>Yeah, I'll take advice
from the guy who's down four grand.</i>

27:17.387 --> 27:19.287
<i>- Is that what I'm supposed to do?
- Just leave.</i>

27:19.289 --> 27:21.690
<i>Please, will you leave,
so we can all win?</i>

27:21.692 --> 27:23.924
- Hey, hey, hey.
- We could all win if you leave.

27:23.926 --> 27:27.062
Fellas, come on. What's the
beef? How can we squash it?

27:27.064 --> 27:29.797
This bo-bo here keeps
hitting on the worst hands.

27:29.799 --> 27:32.100
I play how I play. You
don't like it, you leave.

27:32.102 --> 27:33.669
<i>And he's a thief.</i>

27:33.671 --> 27:35.336
Where's my leaf blower, Garvey?

27:35.338 --> 27:37.506
I just thought maybe you'd
wanna rake a little bit more.

27:37.508 --> 27:40.409
You know, get some physical
activity, on account of you being fat.

27:40.411 --> 27:42.110
Hey, hey! Okay! Time out!

27:42.112 --> 27:44.113
Gentlemen, time out! Time out!

27:44.115 --> 27:45.146
<i>You're 86'd.</i>

27:45.148 --> 27:46.248
Come on!

27:47.584 --> 27:50.552
Right in my armpit! It's
such a sensitive area.

27:50.554 --> 27:52.821
- My gland.
- I'll squash the shit out of you!

27:52.823 --> 27:55.423
They'll be peeling you off
the ground, you sackless bitch.

27:55.425 --> 27:56.892
I'll bet 100 bucks on Reggie.

27:56.894 --> 27:58.626
He's gonna kick Garvey's ass!

27:58.628 --> 28:00.462
I will call that bet, sir.

28:00.464 --> 28:03.565
There is fear in Reggie's eyes.
I know a pussy when I see one.

28:03.567 --> 28:05.133
Only when you're looking down.

28:05.135 --> 28:06.835
Reggie, we got this.

28:06.837 --> 28:08.403
- Eat shit, Garvey.
- That's right.

28:08.405 --> 28:10.271
Laura, you wanna keep your mouth shut?

28:10.273 --> 28:11.573
You got a big fucking mouth.

28:11.575 --> 28:13.241
There's a StairMaster downstairs.

28:13.243 --> 28:15.143
Why don't you go stand
next to it and do nothing?

28:15.145 --> 28:17.679
You want a piece of these thighs?
You don't know what's coming.

28:17.681 --> 28:21.350
Everybody, shut the fuck up!

28:21.352 --> 28:23.450
Nobody is betting on this fight.

28:23.452 --> 28:24.819
- Thank you, Frank.
<i>- What?</i>

28:24.821 --> 28:26.387
<i>- Come on.
- Yes.</i>

28:26.389 --> 28:28.355
Unless you're betting with us!

28:28.357 --> 28:31.794
Damn skippy. Damn skippy.
That's right, I'm gonna...

28:33.364 --> 28:34.930
We're gonna bet on our friends fighting?

28:34.932 --> 28:37.164
Hell, yeah! Are you
kidding? We're a casino.

28:37.166 --> 28:40.134
Have you ever heard of Fight
Night? This is the same thing.

28:40.136 --> 28:42.203
Get your juices in there.

28:42.205 --> 28:44.105
Come on, Scott, these guys are gonna
beat the shit out of each other anyway.

28:44.107 --> 28:45.908
These dildos are gonna bet on it.

28:45.910 --> 28:48.809
We should be getting that
action. We're the house!

28:48.811 --> 28:51.479
- Honey...
- Hey! Who wants a fight?

28:51.481 --> 28:53.448
- Can't wait!
- Can't wait!

28:53.450 --> 28:55.916
- Who wants fight? Say, "Hey!"
- Hey!

28:55.918 --> 28:57.819
- Here we go, fight!
- Here we go!

29:01.491 --> 29:03.726
And we're gonna start a race war!

29:03.728 --> 29:05.027
Whoa! Whoa!

29:05.029 --> 29:07.529
Reggie, Reggie, that makes us nervous.

29:07.531 --> 29:11.499
This is just a fight between
two men of different races,

29:11.501 --> 29:14.368
fighting each other to
decide which race is superior.

29:14.370 --> 29:15.890
- Whoa!
- Nope, that sounds wrong.

29:16.706 --> 29:17.773
Black power!

29:26.716 --> 29:28.983
<i>Welcome to Fight Night!</i>

29:32.155 --> 29:34.489
<i>In the corner closest
to the fireplace,</i>

29:34.491 --> 29:37.860
<i>weighing in at 220 pounds,</i>

29:37.862 --> 29:42.096
<i>Reggie "The Rocket" Whaler.</i>

29:50.173 --> 29:53.208
<i>And in this corner,</i>

29:53.210 --> 29:55.710
<i>weighing in at 180 pounds,</i>

29:55.712 --> 29:57.045
<i>give it up for Kevin</i>

29:57.047 --> 30:01.016
<i>"I Didn't Know His First
Name Was Kevin" Garvey!</i>

30:04.154 --> 30:06.121
Now, murder each other!

30:20.870 --> 30:22.773
Wow. That was fast.

30:26.876 --> 30:28.510
Reggie is the winner!

30:31.115 --> 30:32.948
This is bullshit. I want my money back.

30:32.950 --> 30:34.883
Winner, winner, chicken dinner.

30:34.885 --> 30:37.585
Laura, why don't you shove that
chicken dinner right up your asshole?

30:37.587 --> 30:39.555
And then bring it to my potluck.

30:39.557 --> 30:41.722
For the love of God, if you
bring up that potluck again...

30:41.724 --> 30:44.728
Ladies, uh-uh! Cool your jets!

30:46.196 --> 30:47.497
Yeah.

30:48.231 --> 30:50.798
Save it for the ring!

31:20.230 --> 31:22.264
- Mmm!
- Oh!

31:22.266 --> 31:24.932
What's my name? I'm Martha!

31:40.349 --> 31:41.586
Yes, come on. Fight!

31:46.790 --> 31:48.390
<i>Yeah!</i>

31:48.392 --> 31:50.726
Fuck you, Craig!

31:50.728 --> 31:53.131
I don't know why I love this so much!

31:58.836 --> 32:01.404
Eat her fucking face off, Martha!

32:28.199 --> 32:29.898
Oh, oh!

32:29.900 --> 32:31.235
She doored her!

32:40.610 --> 32:42.179
Oh!

32:49.787 --> 32:50.788
Oh!

32:52.122 --> 32:53.591
Double knockout?

32:55.525 --> 32:58.159
- Whoa, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
- What does that mean?

32:58.161 --> 33:01.796
Okay, the good news is we don't
have a prop bet to cover that,

33:01.798 --> 33:04.132
so the house wins everything!

33:40.170 --> 33:41.335
Whoo, I'm feeling pretty good.

33:41.337 --> 33:42.805
Yeah, me, too.

33:42.807 --> 33:44.976
Can I talk to you in the
laundry room for a second?

33:51.548 --> 33:53.248
This is why I'm not
worried about next year.

33:53.250 --> 33:54.919
No. Not in the least.

33:59.655 --> 34:01.489
Is this a real microscope?

34:01.491 --> 34:04.692
Yeah, dude. You can get high and
look at ants at the same time.

34:09.333 --> 34:11.431
We never walk at night.

34:11.433 --> 34:14.534
- So nice to walk.
- So beautiful.

34:14.536 --> 34:17.004
I drive everywhere. It's
just nice to get out...

34:17.005 --> 34:18.072
Excuse me, beep-beep.

34:18.074 --> 34:19.808
Beep-beep.

34:19.810 --> 34:21.208
Hey, ow. Hey.

34:21.210 --> 34:22.976
- Hey.
- Ow. Hey, ow.

34:22.978 --> 34:25.279
Ow.

34:25.281 --> 34:26.813
- I'm gonna pee outside.
- What?

34:26.815 --> 34:29.116
- I'm gonna take a pee outside.
- What are you doing?

34:29.118 --> 34:30.284
I'm gonna do it.

34:30.286 --> 34:32.022
What, are you kidding? Come on.

34:36.760 --> 34:38.458
- She's doing it.
- Yes! Yes!

34:38.460 --> 34:41.161
- You're so good at it.
- This is the real me!

34:41.164 --> 34:42.230
Yes.

34:42.232 --> 34:43.434
Yes!

34:45.168 --> 34:47.301
<i>"Pee Outside" Kate is back!</i>

34:47.303 --> 34:50.237
- You do it. You're doing it.
- This is my lawn.

34:50.239 --> 34:51.839
- <i>You're a woman.</i>
- This is my lawn.

34:51.841 --> 34:53.511
God, you got a lot of pee-pee.

34:55.043 --> 34:57.678
- Oh, shit!
- What?

34:57.680 --> 34:59.180
Fuck, it's my parents!

34:59.182 --> 35:00.618
God damn it! Quick!

35:04.488 --> 35:05.986
Is she still looking?

35:05.988 --> 35:08.290
Guys, I'm feeling, like,
really nervous right now.

35:08.292 --> 35:09.790
- You want some weed?
- Huh?

35:09.792 --> 35:12.393
We can totally go talk to
her like regular people.

35:12.395 --> 35:15.529
- How drunk are you?
- I'm fine.

35:15.531 --> 35:17.332
How many fingers do I have up?

35:17.334 --> 35:19.000
Don't do that.

35:19.002 --> 35:20.201
Who's the president?

35:20.203 --> 35:21.803
The president?

35:21.805 --> 35:23.437
Bah...

35:23.439 --> 35:25.806
- Ba-Obama.
- Mmm-hmm.

35:25.808 --> 35:28.343
The back, the back, they
never come in through the back.

35:28.345 --> 35:30.044
We'll just sneak through there.

35:30.046 --> 35:31.480
We'll go around the back.

35:31.482 --> 35:33.080
- Yeah. No, we never go through the back.
- Let's do it.

35:33.082 --> 35:34.484
- Go.
- Go.

35:43.660 --> 35:45.225
What are you doing?

35:45.227 --> 35:46.830
Sorry. I'm so high.

35:50.966 --> 35:52.135
The coast is clear.

35:59.276 --> 36:00.774
Oh!

36:00.776 --> 36:02.310
- Do you hear something?
- What is it? Raccoons?

36:02.312 --> 36:03.377
<i>It sounds human.</i>

36:03.379 --> 36:04.749
- Go.
- Okay.

36:17.993 --> 36:20.629
- It's good. Rachel...
- It's Rachel.

36:20.631 --> 36:23.131
- And Alex. Hey!
- Hey!

36:23.133 --> 36:24.165
Alex.

36:24.167 --> 36:25.433
- Hey!
- Hey!

36:25.435 --> 36:27.404
What's up, guys?

36:28.372 --> 36:29.573
I got them.

36:30.305 --> 36:32.373
Sorry. Sorry, Rachel.

36:32.375 --> 36:35.142
- Alex sandwich.
- Alex sandwich.

36:35.144 --> 36:36.410
Oh, God.

36:38.281 --> 36:40.381
Aw, sweetie.

36:40.383 --> 36:42.216
You guys have fun tonight?

36:42.218 --> 36:43.551
Great hug.

36:43.553 --> 36:45.419
Okay, this went great. We're fine.

36:45.421 --> 36:47.122
Night-night.

36:47.124 --> 36:48.692
I'm gonna go pee.

36:50.292 --> 36:51.761
And I'm good.

36:54.330 --> 36:55.665
Oh, God.

36:56.499 --> 36:57.801
Oh, God.

37:11.147 --> 37:12.913
Oh...

37:12.915 --> 37:15.350
Good thing it's a container store.

37:15.352 --> 37:17.520
There's containers everywhere.

37:23.026 --> 37:24.524
Honey?

37:24.526 --> 37:27.197
Yeah. I'm just gonna
lie down. Check some emails.

37:30.133 --> 37:31.135
Um...

37:31.868 --> 37:32.870
Fuck.

37:41.144 --> 37:43.147
Excuse me one second.

37:46.482 --> 37:48.015
Oh...

37:48.017 --> 37:49.116
Raina?

37:49.118 --> 37:51.018
You're the Raina of Raina's Hair Salon?

37:51.020 --> 37:53.888
Okay, what are you doing here?
You got the divorce papers?

37:53.890 --> 37:55.555
Listen, I'm onto something big.

37:55.557 --> 37:56.890
- Oh, God.
- Okay?

37:56.892 --> 37:58.493
No, and it's not some harebrained scheme

37:58.495 --> 37:59.895
that I cooked up with my friends.

37:59.897 --> 38:01.229
- I'm gonna get the house back...
- Cool.

38:01.231 --> 38:03.330
And we're not gonna need to get divorced.

38:03.332 --> 38:05.634
It's not gonna need to even
happen. I'm gonna make it up to you.

38:05.636 --> 38:06.901
- Are you gambling again?
- What?

38:06.903 --> 38:08.203
- Is that what this is?
- No, no.

38:08.205 --> 38:09.770
- You gambling again?
- No. And in fact...

38:09.772 --> 38:12.510
- Uh-huh.
- I'm not gambling.

38:15.078 --> 38:17.444
- Why'd you say it like that?
- What do you mean?

38:17.446 --> 38:20.614
- No. Sorry, I'm just saying, in terms of gambling...
- Yeah.

38:20.616 --> 38:23.317
People might be doing it, but I'm not.

38:23.319 --> 38:25.988
- You just did it again.
- What? I'm not gambling.

38:25.990 --> 38:28.189
- "I'm not gambling"?
- Yeah, that's right.

38:28.191 --> 38:30.424
All right, I'm not gonna
argue with you. You look nice.

38:30.426 --> 38:31.826
Oh, thanks.

38:31.828 --> 38:33.261
Well, you smell good.
I mean, you look good.

38:33.263 --> 38:34.595
- What? Okay. No, yeah.
- I mean, you're nice.

38:34.597 --> 38:36.131
I'm not doing this.

38:36.133 --> 38:40.868
Just because you've
showered and you look great,

38:40.870 --> 38:42.306
it doesn't mean you've changed.

38:46.410 --> 38:48.745
Yes! Yes! Yes!

38:51.281 --> 38:54.381
<i>You might notice that I've
made some Vegas-style upgrades.</i>

38:54.383 --> 38:56.517
Welcome to Club Ooze.

38:56.519 --> 38:59.488
Because what does every casino
need, but a kick-ass pool.

38:59.490 --> 39:02.357
You're done gambling, what
are you gonna do? Go home? No.

39:02.359 --> 39:05.292
You're gonna come out here,
get a drink, party in the pool

39:05.294 --> 39:08.095
and then back inside to lose more money.

39:08.097 --> 39:09.864
How much did all of this cost?

39:09.866 --> 39:11.986
You know that old saying,
"Spend money to make money."

39:12.301 --> 39:13.767
Hmm.

39:13.769 --> 39:16.805
- Now, this I'm very excited about.
- Oh, wow.

39:16.807 --> 39:18.406
These are pure oxygen tanks.

39:18.408 --> 39:20.611
I'm pumping it into the
house, and guess what...

39:21.611 --> 39:23.710
It works.

39:23.712 --> 39:25.881
Welcome to the relaxation zone.

39:25.883 --> 39:29.951
We've got a nail salon,
we've got massages, shiatsu,

39:29.953 --> 39:32.222
deep tissue and hand jobs.

39:38.528 --> 39:42.129
Bob... I think we really need to start.

39:42.131 --> 39:43.765
I'll start when everyone's here.

39:43.767 --> 39:45.903
- Stop it.
- What?

39:48.404 --> 39:50.270
<i>Where is everyone, Laura?</i>

39:50.272 --> 39:52.373
Nowhere. Why do you
think they're somewhere?

39:52.375 --> 39:55.410
<i>Why are you wearing
sunglasses in town hall?</i>

39:55.412 --> 39:56.680
'Cause...

39:57.513 --> 39:58.879
my future's so bright.

39:58.881 --> 40:01.015
<i>Well, I find it
highly disrespectful.</i>

40:01.017 --> 40:03.087
<i>Would you please
remove the sunglasses?</i>

40:04.486 --> 40:06.154
- Fine.
<i>- Ugh.</i>

40:06.156 --> 40:07.324
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

40:08.924 --> 40:10.191
<i>What happened?</i>

40:10.193 --> 40:12.158
This looks way worse than it is.

40:12.160 --> 40:13.527
<i>What are you hiding, Laura?</i>

40:13.529 --> 40:15.062
<i>What's that face?</i>

40:15.064 --> 40:17.165
- Oh, you wanna fight me, Bob?
- <i>What?</i>

40:17.167 --> 40:18.600
Is that what this is about, Bob?

40:18.602 --> 40:20.067
<i>'Cause I'll tell you right now,</i>

40:20.069 --> 40:22.972
I'll headbutt you to next Tuesday, bitch!

40:25.408 --> 40:26.607
- Well...
- Okay.

40:26.609 --> 40:28.442
<i>This town hall meeting is suspended</i>

40:28.444 --> 40:31.714

41:15.624 --> 41:18.593
I can't believe no one
showed up at the goddamn meeting.

41:18.595 --> 41:23.497
And I was going to announce that Panera
was opening a location on Butler Ave.

41:23.499 --> 41:24.901
Panera Bread?

41:26.535 --> 41:28.303
Wow. Great get, Bob.

41:29.372 --> 41:31.238
My God, you do so much for this town.

41:31.240 --> 41:34.508
It's a 24/7 job. But I love it.

41:34.510 --> 41:38.048
Plus, means I get to
spend more time with you.

41:38.515 --> 41:39.580
Stop.

41:39.582 --> 41:41.084
- What?
- Stop it.

41:46.122 --> 41:47.654
Were you guys holding hands?

41:47.656 --> 41:49.556
Yeah. We were holding hands,
Chandler, you know why?

41:49.558 --> 41:51.426
- Yeah.
- 'Cause we're having an affair.

41:51.428 --> 41:52.560
Yeah.

41:52.562 --> 41:54.395
Nine and a half months,
emotional and physical.

41:54.397 --> 41:56.631
Yep. He knows about
all my hopes and dreams.

41:56.633 --> 41:59.200
Yeah, yeah, I plead with
her to leave her husband,

41:59.202 --> 42:02.372
but in reality, I would be
sort of scared if she did.

42:03.573 --> 42:05.038
That's so specific.

42:05.040 --> 42:07.008
It just sounds like it's true.

42:07.010 --> 42:09.276
No, there's nothing going
on with us, Chandler.

42:09.278 --> 42:11.279
But there is something
going on in this town.

42:11.281 --> 42:13.547
I've been noticing a lot of
crazy shit going on in this town.

42:13.549 --> 42:16.917
Over at Taylor's Meat Market at night,
the parking lot is really crowded.

42:16.919 --> 42:18.585
Maybe there's some flank steaks

42:18.587 --> 42:21.055
that are starting a gang over there.

42:21.057 --> 42:23.591
Looks like a pork chop prostitution ring.

42:24.894 --> 42:26.459
Now leave, so we can have sex.

42:26.461 --> 42:28.364
Yeah.

42:30.299 --> 42:33.366
Okay, I'll get the
blinds. But make it quick.

42:41.477 --> 42:42.877
How are we looking tonight?

42:42.879 --> 42:44.312
Garvey caught a heater in blackjack,

42:44.314 --> 42:46.480
but we're killing it in roulette.

42:46.482 --> 42:50.250
Good call hiring that Judy, by
the way, she destroys people.

42:50.252 --> 42:52.488
- She's a bad-ass bitch.
- Hi, Judy.

42:54.323 --> 42:55.790
You're very smart with this stuff.

42:55.792 --> 42:57.094
Very shrewd.

42:58.694 --> 43:00.828
- Where'd you get that?
- This?

43:00.830 --> 43:03.930
Joe gave it to me. Some sticky-icky
hybrid. It chills me the fuck out.

43:03.932 --> 43:05.299
You want some?

43:05.301 --> 43:07.234
No. No, I'm good. Maybe later.

43:07.236 --> 43:10.203
I gotta stay vigilant.
Keep my eye on the prize.

43:10.205 --> 43:12.806
Yeah. Weed is so great, you know?

43:12.808 --> 43:14.642
When I smoke it, I feel nothing.

43:14.644 --> 43:17.145
It's like emotional armor, man.

43:17.147 --> 43:19.613
Alex is gone next year, who cares?

43:19.615 --> 43:21.250
I got weed.

43:22.252 --> 43:23.984
- And me.
- And you, yes.

43:23.986 --> 43:26.955
Guys, we've got a problem.

43:26.957 --> 43:28.689
Table four, third guy from the left.

43:28.691 --> 43:31.326
This motherfucker right
here is counting cards.

43:31.328 --> 43:34.932
How do you know? If I'm gonna accuse
someone of cheating, I wanna be sure.

43:39.970 --> 43:41.335
- He's cheating.
- Yeah.

43:41.337 --> 43:43.504
- He's definitely cheating.
- That's so rude.

43:43.506 --> 43:45.372
If people think you can
come in here and cheat,

43:45.374 --> 43:47.442
the street is gonna think we're soft.

43:47.444 --> 43:50.645
Yeah. Every Blackjack Barry and Roulette
Rob's gonna think it's open season.

43:50.647 --> 43:52.913
We gotta do something to send a message.

43:52.915 --> 43:54.582
- Yep.
- Like De Niro in <i>Casino.</i>

43:54.584 --> 43:57.886
Didn't he break that
guy's hand with a hammer?

43:57.888 --> 43:59.089
Yeah.

44:03.091 --> 44:04.593
- Okay.
- Yeah.

44:04.595 --> 44:06.060
Yeah.

44:06.062 --> 44:07.964
- All right. Okay.
- Yeah.

44:11.401 --> 44:12.533
Kazowee!

44:14.403 --> 44:16.437
Excuse me, can we have
a word with you, please?

44:16.439 --> 44:19.408
Yeah, I'd love another Grey
Goose on the rocks, extra lime.

44:20.711 --> 44:22.977
Come on, let's go. Let's go.

44:22.979 --> 44:24.345
Enjoy your gambling.

44:24.347 --> 44:25.513
- Get in here.
- All right, okay.

44:25.515 --> 44:26.848
- Get in here!
- Watch the jacket.

44:26.850 --> 44:28.415
- Sit down!
- Sit down!

44:28.417 --> 44:30.116
You think you can cheat us?

44:30.118 --> 44:32.020
You think you can steal our money?

44:32.022 --> 44:35.922
I got lucky. I didn't know it
was illegal to catch a hot streak.

44:35.924 --> 44:37.759
Well, your luck just ran out, man,

44:37.761 --> 44:39.893
because me and my friends
about to fuck you up!

44:39.895 --> 44:41.895
<i>- Yeah!</i>
- Hey, pal.

44:41.897 --> 44:45.098
You better call your momma and tell
her you're gonna be late for dinner.

44:45.100 --> 44:48.902
Which is a shame, 'cause she's
serving your favorite, coconut shrimps!

44:48.904 --> 44:50.471
Hey, you're gonna miss dinner, bitch!

44:50.473 --> 44:52.339
We had your mom's shrimp last night.

44:52.341 --> 44:54.375
- Yeah!
- It was delicious!

44:54.377 --> 44:56.910
What are you guys gonna do about it
anyway? You're a bunch of soccer moms.

44:56.912 --> 45:00.147
You ever hear of Tommy
Papouli? He's my boss.

45:00.149 --> 45:03.451
You know what? Fuck this
guy. And fuck Tommy whoever.

45:03.453 --> 45:06.221
I'd like to introduce you
to my friend, Mr. Vice.

45:06.223 --> 45:08.788
- How does that feel?
- Yeah, I got it.

45:08.790 --> 45:09.991
Coat's coming off, bitch!

45:09.993 --> 45:11.595
- Coming off!
- Oh!

45:17.700 --> 45:21.103
You taking your jacket
back to Marshalls?

45:22.537 --> 45:25.239
- Oh, shit!
- I'm gonna get me a chunk of flesh.

45:25.241 --> 45:28.743
Yeah! Yeah, maybe we'll
cut your fucking dick off.

45:28.745 --> 45:30.076
Oh, shit!

45:30.078 --> 45:31.846
Oh, shit!

45:31.848 --> 45:33.848
This shit just got real, bro!

45:33.850 --> 45:35.283
I'm so scared.

45:35.285 --> 45:37.352
- You're looking at a bad man.
- Ooh.

45:37.354 --> 45:39.687
- This motherfucker don't give a shit.
- Yep.

45:39.689 --> 45:43.123
- This axe is burning a hole in my pocket.
- What are we doing?

45:43.125 --> 45:44.759
Can we just conference on what we're doing?

45:44.761 --> 45:47.026
- We're gonna... Just you wait.
- Hold on.

45:47.028 --> 45:49.230
We need to focus up and
figure out what we're gonna do.

45:49.232 --> 45:50.830
- Honey, are you still stoned?
- What?

45:50.832 --> 45:52.466
Yes!

45:52.468 --> 45:54.102
<i>I am also stoned
and nothing is more clear</i>

45:54.104 --> 45:56.104
than the fact that we
need to murder this guy.

45:56.106 --> 45:58.006
Just to be clear, we're pretending, though,

45:58.008 --> 45:59.774
we're not gonna actually do that.

45:59.776 --> 46:01.810
We have to send a message,
okay? We have to send a message.

46:01.812 --> 46:03.176
Yeah!

46:03.178 --> 46:04.979
You're bluffing.

46:04.981 --> 46:07.247
You're not gonna do shit.

46:07.249 --> 46:10.017
You're not gonna do jack shit, Paul Bunyan.

46:10.019 --> 46:11.652
- He's a jerk!
- He's making it easy.

46:11.654 --> 46:13.587
You know what? I'm gonna do this.

46:13.589 --> 46:14.754
I'm gonna do this.

46:14.756 --> 46:16.491
Hey, hey, hey, hold on.

46:16.493 --> 46:18.058
- Fuck off! You're not gonna do shit.
- No, I'm gonna use...

46:18.060 --> 46:19.861
Tommy's gonna kick your fucking ass.

46:19.863 --> 46:21.495
Fuck you!

46:21.497 --> 46:23.733
- Don't wrestle with the fucking axe!
- Fuck you all!

46:28.738 --> 46:31.672
- Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!
- Shut the fuck up, Frank!

46:31.674 --> 46:34.308
- Put it back on! Put it back on!
- I'm trying to find it!

46:34.310 --> 46:35.576
I'm trying to find it!

46:35.578 --> 46:38.111
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Shut up!

46:38.113 --> 46:39.314
Apply pressure, man.

46:39.316 --> 46:41.015
- Please, apply pressure.
- I'm trying!

46:41.017 --> 46:43.084
It's so slippery!

46:43.086 --> 46:45.218
It won't fit on! It won't fit back on!

46:45.220 --> 46:46.988
Honey, please get it on.

46:46.990 --> 46:49.823
I don't know if it's up or
down. Does anyone have any gum?

46:49.825 --> 46:52.160
I'm just gonna put it right
there, maybe it'll grow back.

46:52.162 --> 46:53.962
- Oh, God!
- Oh, my God, the blood!

46:53.964 --> 46:56.029
Could this help?

46:56.031 --> 46:58.165
Put that Croc on there.

47:00.236 --> 47:02.703
So salty! I'm swallowing so much blood!

47:02.705 --> 47:04.270
You cut off my fucking finger!

47:05.408 --> 47:07.274
What the fuck just happened?

47:07.276 --> 47:09.176
Tell your friends, if they mess with us,

47:09.178 --> 47:11.381
this is what... They're gonna get.

47:28.564 --> 47:30.964
Nothing ever happens in this neighborhood.

47:41.810 --> 47:43.042
Oh.

47:48.952 --> 47:50.350
Sweetheart!

47:50.352 --> 47:52.118
<i>- Scott?
- Where are you going?</i>

47:52.120 --> 47:54.390
<i>Where are you going
Don't go in there, buddy!</i>

48:39.801 --> 48:42.203
No, I swear to God, I'm looking,
Reggie. I'm not finding it.

48:42.205 --> 48:46.205
In my experience, money lost in
the woods does not easily get found.

48:46.207 --> 48:49.343
Oh, fuck. Oh!

48:49.345 --> 48:51.178
Buddy, great news.

48:51.180 --> 48:52.580
Excuse me, sir?

48:52.582 --> 48:55.316
- I'll call you back.
- What are you doing out here?

48:55.318 --> 48:57.486
Um... Uh...

49:01.189 --> 49:02.555
Jogging.

49:02.557 --> 49:05.192
You don't appear to be jogging.

49:05.194 --> 49:08.694
- Well, now you're jogging.
- You caught me in a cooldown. Whoo!

49:08.696 --> 49:10.596
What'd you put in your pocket?

49:10.598 --> 49:12.832
Very slowly. Very slowly
with the hand, sir.

49:12.834 --> 49:15.902
- Very slowly, take it out of your pocket.
- Okay, Officer.

49:15.904 --> 49:20.640
I think, earlier, you just saw
me put this phone in my pocket,

49:20.642 --> 49:22.944
which is now videotaping you.

49:22.946 --> 49:25.779
I don't feel safe, I don't feel safe.

49:25.781 --> 49:27.381
I am Frank Theodorakis.

49:27.383 --> 49:29.716
I don't feel safe in the woods,
the police are harassing me.

49:29.718 --> 49:31.852
Hello, everyone, I'm Officer Chandler,

49:31.854 --> 49:34.721
and I'm here protecting as well as serving.

49:34.723 --> 49:36.656
What are you, like, doing a PSA?

49:36.658 --> 49:38.392
Well, if you're filming this.

49:38.394 --> 49:40.460
Look at you, you put your
hands on your hips immediately.

49:40.462 --> 49:42.029
You look ridiculous.

49:42.031 --> 49:43.096
I will end you!

49:43.098 --> 49:44.797
<i>I will end your life!</i>

49:44.799 --> 49:46.734
Whoa! Whoa, man!

49:46.736 --> 49:49.937
I'm sorry that I said that, everyone,

49:49.939 --> 49:51.172
and I...

49:51.174 --> 49:52.772
am gonna...

49:52.774 --> 49:54.776
What's that? I'm gonna
respond to this call.

49:54.778 --> 49:56.643
What call? Nothing happened.
It didn't say anything.

49:56.645 --> 49:59.314
There's a disturbance in the force.

49:59.316 --> 50:01.451
There's a disturbance in the police force.

50:16.098 --> 50:17.897
Dad.

50:17.899 --> 50:19.399
What...

50:19.401 --> 50:20.634
Dad, it's just...

50:20.636 --> 50:22.268
It's just, it's good... Dad!

50:22.270 --> 50:23.606
Don't touch 'em!

50:24.506 --> 50:26.575
Hey, did you see the game?

50:30.580 --> 50:32.515
Stay away from the meat section!

50:33.649 --> 50:35.248
<i>Hey, there you are.</i>

50:35.250 --> 50:37.620
Everybody's looking for you
downstairs. What's going on?

50:38.854 --> 50:40.323
- Hey.
- Hey.

50:41.723 --> 50:44.424
- So many buttholes, so little time, huh?
- Yeah.

50:44.426 --> 50:47.194
You okay, man? You seem a little off today.

50:47.196 --> 50:50.064
I don't know.
Something's changed, Frank.

50:50.066 --> 50:52.064
I chopped a man's finger off.

50:52.066 --> 50:55.902
And ever since that moment,
I've just been barraged

50:55.904 --> 50:57.337
with a series of

50:57.339 --> 50:59.672
anxiety-induced hallucinations.

50:59.674 --> 51:03.142
They're hallucinations. They're not real.

51:03.144 --> 51:05.047
You know what is real?

51:08.283 --> 51:10.017
This is real.

51:10.019 --> 51:11.352
<i>This is real.</i>

51:11.354 --> 51:13.154
This is real.

51:13.156 --> 51:14.622
And this is real.

51:14.624 --> 51:16.489
And do you know where
all that money came from?

51:16.491 --> 51:19.026
- Hmm.
- From you.

51:19.028 --> 51:21.294
You chopped that guy's finger off,

51:21.296 --> 51:23.230
and the whole town became afraid.

51:23.232 --> 51:25.765
- You know what they're calling you on the street?
- Uh-uh.

51:25.767 --> 51:26.701
The Butcher.

51:26.703 --> 51:28.368
They're so afraid of us,

51:28.370 --> 51:30.971
people are starting to give us
the money they owe us.

51:30.973 --> 51:33.306
I didn't know people owed us money.

51:33.308 --> 51:35.241
Oh, I've been extending lines of credit

51:35.243 --> 51:36.843
to all of our high rollers.

51:36.845 --> 51:38.712
All the casinos do it. It's not a big deal.

51:38.714 --> 51:41.582
Frank, you didn't tell me that.

51:41.584 --> 51:42.982
And that's a huge decision.

51:42.984 --> 51:44.584
You need to let Kate
and I be a part of that.

51:44.586 --> 51:46.921
It's a moot point now, okay? It's done.

51:46.923 --> 51:48.022
Everybody's afraid that

51:48.024 --> 51:49.790
you're gonna take them into the garage

51:49.792 --> 51:52.459

- Maybe I should count it.

Oh. Are you gonna count

52:42.711 --> 52:44.044

52:45.647 --> 52:47.547

56:25.868 --> 56:28.067
Go arrest that guy. He attacked me.

56:28.069 --> 56:30.069
Mr. Theodorakis, I talked to him.

56:30.071 --> 56:31.872
He said that you attacked him,

56:31.874 --> 56:33.739
and then you grabbed his man bun.

56:33.741 --> 56:37.176

57:00.535 --> 57:03.002

01:01:05.613 --> 01:01:07.013
Aw, what?

01:01:07.015 --> 01:01:08.716
And also, we're
confiscating all your money.

01:01:08.718 --> 01:01:11.084
Hold on, you can't take the
money. It's for our daughter.

01:01:11.086 --> 01:01:12.953
You're gonna take their money, Bob?

01:01:12.955 --> 01:01:14.421
I'm not gonna take their money.

01:01:14.423 --> 01:01:16.957
I'm gonna confiscate
their money for the town.

01:01:16.959 --> 01:01:18.424
Come on, Chandler,

01:01:18.426 --> 01:01:19.892
you're not gonna get
caught up in this, are you?

01:01:19.894 --> 01:01:21.493
You're a good guy.

01:01:21.495 --> 01:01:25.031
Who's always lead baritone
when we go Christmas caroling?

01:01:25.033 --> 01:01:26.765
Come on.

01:01:26.767 --> 01:01:31.171
<i>♪ Hark the herald angels sing</i>

01:01:31.173 --> 01:01:35.441
<i>- ♪ Glory to the newborn king ♪</i>
- BOB: <i>Shut up.</i>

01:01:35.443 --> 01:01:38.245
You remember when you guys
started an illegal casino?

01:01:38.247 --> 01:01:40.346
I'm Alex.
I wanna go to Bucknell.

01:01:40.348 --> 01:01:42.049
- Bob, enough.
- But my parents fucked up.

01:01:42.051 --> 01:01:43.250
They couldn't find the money,

01:01:43.252 --> 01:01:44.984
so they started an illegal casino.

01:01:44.986 --> 01:01:46.386
Bob, she's a kid.

01:01:46.388 --> 01:01:47.453
Oh, oh.

01:01:47.455 --> 01:01:49.991
We're taking the cash.

01:01:52.261 --> 01:01:55.229
Let's go, Chandler. Shut it down.

01:01:55.231 --> 01:01:57.533
Bob. Bob!
That money's for college.

01:01:59.368 --> 01:02:01.535
<i>Tonight at
11:00. Earlier this week,</i>

01:02:01.537 --> 01:02:04.337
<i>a local man was treated
at Sacred Heart Hospital</i>

01:02:04.339 --> 01:02:06.073
<i>for a severed middle finger.</i>

01:02:06.075 --> 01:02:07.341
<i>Authorities believe

01:02:07.343 --> 01:02:09.475
<i>to the recent local crime spree.</i>

01:02:09.477 --> 01:02:12.379
<i>The man is known to have

01:02:12.381 --> 01:02:14.113
<i>long suspected of racketeering,</i>

01:02:14.115 --> 01:02:16.551
<i>illegal gambling, and even murder.</i>

01:02:20.421 --> 01:02:21.690
Hey, sweetie.

01:02:23.524 --> 01:02:26.292
You were watching <i>Walking
Dead</i> without us?

01:02:26.294 --> 01:02:29.564
Yeah. Lizzie killed Mika.

01:02:38.707 --> 01:02:40.372
Fuck, we suck.

01:02:40.374 --> 01:02:41.575
We lost all our money.

01:02:41.577 --> 01:02:42.841
And I am mentally and physically

01:02:42.843 --> 01:02:44.511
addicted to marijuana.

01:02:44.513 --> 01:02:45.444
Honey, you love it.

01:02:45.446 --> 01:02:46.714
I think about it all the time.

01:02:46.716 --> 01:02:48.147
It's really hard to focus right now.

01:02:48.149 --> 01:02:49.850
I'm so mad I'm not high.

01:02:49.852 --> 01:02:51.183
And we started a fight club.

01:02:51.185 --> 01:02:52.618
What are we doing?

01:02:52.620 --> 01:02:55.154
We're each other's
enabler. We're not even...

01:02:55.156 --> 01:02:57.093
One of us has to be an adult here.

01:02:58.727 --> 01:03:00.462
So you do it.

01:03:01.397 --> 01:03:02.328
You be it.

01:03:02.330 --> 01:03:04.767
Okay. I'll be the adult.

01:03:06.135 --> 01:03:08.301
And, as the adult,

01:03:08.303 --> 01:03:10.437
I'm gonna say, we're gonna call Frank

01:03:10.439 --> 01:03:13.373
and tell him to shut it down.

01:03:13.375 --> 01:03:14.441
Okay.

01:03:14.443 --> 01:03:15.375
And that's how we're gonna handle it.

01:03:15.377 --> 01:03:17.343
Okay.

01:03:17.345 --> 01:03:19.011
- What a relief.
- Right?

01:03:19.013 --> 01:03:21.781
- Or we keep it open, and go big.
- Or we do. Yeah.

01:03:21.783 --> 01:03:23.116
Fuck Bob Schaeffer.

01:03:23.118 --> 01:03:24.451
I'm not gonna look my daughter in the eye

01:03:24.453 --> 01:03:25.618
and tell her she can't go to college,

01:03:25.620 --> 01:03:26.819
because some small-time

01:03:26.821 --> 01:03:28.455
city councilman is bullying us.

01:03:28.457 --> 01:03:30.223
Exactly! We'll call everyone

01:03:30.225 --> 01:03:31.825
and tell them the casino is still open.

01:03:31.827 --> 01:03:34.294
- Yes.
- No limit on any bet in the house.

01:03:34.296 --> 01:03:36.562
We go big, we make our money,

01:03:36.564 --> 01:03:38.665
and then we parachute out of there.

01:03:38.667 --> 01:03:39.899
Go big, or go home.

01:03:39.901 --> 01:03:42.435
- Let's do this!
- Okay.

01:03:42.437 --> 01:03:44.770
<i>All right,
here we go Here we go!</i>

01:03:44.772 --> 01:03:46.105
<i>All right!</i>

01:03:46.107 --> 01:03:48.575
<i>This is fun! Whoo!</i>

01:03:48.577 --> 01:03:49.576
<i>That guy!</i>

01:03:49.578 --> 01:03:51.310
Fuck Bob Schaeffer! Whoo!

01:03:51.312 --> 01:03:53.047
We got a professional shooter here.

01:03:53.049 --> 01:03:54.980
He can't tell us to shut down!

01:03:54.982 --> 01:03:58.051
<i>Let's go! Two
more Let's go. Come on.</i>

01:04:02.924 --> 01:04:06.192
Wow. Hey, Raina.

01:04:06.194 --> 01:04:08.127
- What a pleasant surprise.
- Oh, my God!

01:04:08.129 --> 01:04:09.596
You said, "I'm not gambling."

01:04:09.598 --> 01:04:12.568
Raina, I meant that. I'm not!

01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:14.401
They are!

01:04:14.403 --> 01:04:16.270
All of them, and they're losing.

01:04:16.272 --> 01:04:17.504
You know, when you emphasize

01:04:17.506 --> 01:04:19.238
one word more than the other,

01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:20.873
you know that's bullshit, right?

01:04:20.875 --> 01:04:24.209
Okay, so do you want me to
emphasize something for you?

01:04:24.211 --> 01:04:27.615
I am not coming back.

01:04:29.818 --> 01:04:30.819
Oof.

01:04:36.258 --> 01:04:38.258
They said go through Taylor's,

01:04:38.260 --> 01:04:41.260
- then through the woods, then we'll get to the casino!
- Let's do it!

01:04:42.097 --> 01:04:44.499
Ooh.

01:04:50.472 --> 01:04:53.372
I'm beginning to think
Raina's not gonna take me back.

01:04:53.374 --> 01:04:57.109
Mom? Dad? What are you guys doing here?

01:04:57.111 --> 01:04:58.745
Alex, what are you doing here?

01:04:58.747 --> 01:05:01.247
We got invited to this casino.

01:05:01.249 --> 01:05:02.415
You shouldn't be here.

01:05:02.417 --> 01:05:03.817
- What?
- Come with us.

01:05:03.819 --> 01:05:05.551
Sweetheart, it's very complicated,

01:05:05.553 --> 01:05:07.455
but we need to tell you a few things.

01:05:15.129 --> 01:05:16.629
Hello?

01:05:16.631 --> 01:05:19.765
Hey, go around back.
There's a secret entrance.

01:05:19.767 --> 01:05:21.968
The password is Andre the...

01:05:25.106 --> 01:05:27.406
Holy fuck, look at this place.

01:05:27.408 --> 01:05:28.741
When you said casino,

01:05:28.743 --> 01:05:30.479
I didn't think you meant fucking casino.

01:05:37.051 --> 01:05:39.185
Remember me, motherfucker?

01:05:39.187 --> 01:05:41.587
Wow, that looks great.

01:05:41.589 --> 01:05:43.589
Hey, dickfuck, you're not gonna like Tommy.

01:05:43.591 --> 01:05:46.259
He doesn't cut off
fingers, he cuts off heads.

01:05:46.261 --> 01:05:48.527
Shut up. Come on.

01:05:48.529 --> 01:05:50.029
Guys, we've got a problem.

01:05:52.066 --> 01:05:53.767
- He's got a gun.
- Okay.

01:05:53.769 --> 01:05:54.701
Where's the money?

01:05:54.703 --> 01:05:56.268
- We just got robbed.
- Yeah.

01:05:56.270 --> 01:05:57.703
Look, the safes are all empty.

01:05:57.705 --> 01:05:59.105
Do you know how many times

01:05:59.107 --> 01:06:00.406
I've seen someone point to an empty safe

01:06:00.408 --> 01:06:02.142
and say, "We have no money"?

01:06:02.144 --> 01:06:03.410
- A hundred?
- Five hundred?

01:06:03.412 --> 01:06:04.710
- Thirty thousand.
- It's rhetorical, fuckstick.

01:06:04.712 --> 01:06:06.011
<i>- Okay.</i>
- Shut up.

01:06:06.013 --> 01:06:07.046
This your daughter?

01:06:07.048 --> 01:06:08.147
- Where?
- Who? Her?

01:06:08.149 --> 01:06:09.515
Right here.

01:06:09.517 --> 01:06:11.285
That's such a compliment. This is my wife.

01:06:11.287 --> 01:06:13.352
Alex?

01:06:13.354 --> 01:06:14.520
<i>- In fact, there's our daughter.</i>
- There she is. Hello, daughter.

01:06:14.522 --> 01:06:15.888
<i>Hi, honey.</i>

01:06:15.890 --> 01:06:17.055
Don't overthink it. Just be our daughter.

01:06:17.057 --> 01:06:18.325
Come right here.

01:06:18.327 --> 01:06:19.895
I'm not your daughter. That's your...

01:06:21.962 --> 01:06:23.596
Sorry, Rachel!

01:06:23.598 --> 01:06:25.364
- Fuck's the matter with you?
- What?

01:06:25.366 --> 01:06:26.765
Shoving a girl like that?

01:06:26.767 --> 01:06:29.069
We are strict disciplinarians
in our household.

01:06:29.071 --> 01:06:30.303
Get out of my way.

01:06:30.305 --> 01:06:31.904
- I know this is your daughter.
- Mom!

01:06:31.906 --> 01:06:32.939
No, no, no!

01:06:32.941 --> 01:06:34.174
- Cuff her.
<i>- Sweetie.</i>

01:06:34.176 --> 01:06:35.575
- Mom.
- Honey.

01:06:35.577 --> 01:06:37.310
- No.
- Wait, no.

01:06:37.312 --> 01:06:39.178
Take me, not her.

01:06:39.180 --> 01:06:40.846
No. No one cares if you die.

01:06:40.848 --> 01:06:41.948
Oh, thank God.

01:06:41.950 --> 01:06:43.049
Help 'em find the money.

01:06:43.051 --> 01:06:44.551
<i>Oh, and hey...</i>

01:06:44.553 --> 01:06:47.520
300 grand. Or you'll never
see your daughter again.

01:06:47.522 --> 01:06:50.857
- Mom! Dad! Help! Help!
- Fuck you. Fuck you.

01:06:50.859 --> 01:06:52.091
Let go of me.

01:06:54.629 --> 01:06:57.997
You know what? You got us.

01:06:57.999 --> 01:07:01.500
There's $300,000 in money in this room,

01:07:01.502 --> 01:07:04.671
hidden in these money, uh, buckets.

01:07:04.673 --> 01:07:07.774
So, if you want, you can take the money

01:07:07.776 --> 01:07:09.808
and we'll take their daughter back.

01:07:09.810 --> 01:07:11.109
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:07:11.111 --> 01:07:12.611
There's one here,
there's one behind the bed

01:07:12.613 --> 01:07:14.316
and there's one right over there.

01:07:15.417 --> 01:07:17.116
Money cannon.

01:07:19.821 --> 01:07:21.120
Yeah!

01:07:21.122 --> 01:07:23.958
Don't worry, guys, I got this.

01:07:25.359 --> 01:07:26.926
Yes!

01:07:26.928 --> 01:07:29.464
Oh, no! Not in Frank's place, you don't!

01:07:32.500 --> 01:07:33.968
He's got a knife.

01:07:36.404 --> 01:07:37.502
Look what he did.

01:07:37.504 --> 01:07:39.172
Oh, my God, Frank.

01:07:39.174 --> 01:07:40.573
Frank! Frank!

01:07:40.575 --> 01:07:42.674
- Raina.
- Are you okay?

01:07:42.676 --> 01:07:44.910
- God.
- Did you see him stab me?

01:07:44.912 --> 01:07:47.147
- Yes...
- It was so cool and effortless.

01:07:47.149 --> 01:07:49.316
- Oh, no!
- Okay. Okay.

01:07:49.318 --> 01:07:51.984
Let's go. Come on.

01:07:51.986 --> 01:07:55.020
Jesus. Aren't you supposed
to be getting me my money?

01:07:55.022 --> 01:07:56.555
- Pal?
- Dad?

01:07:56.557 --> 01:07:58.626
My name's not Pal.

01:08:00.060 --> 01:08:01.560
They call me the Butcher.

01:08:01.562 --> 01:08:04.464
- Is that right?
- Alex! Stranger danger!

01:08:12.174 --> 01:08:14.439
Fuck!

01:08:14.441 --> 01:08:17.478
- Oh, God!
- Don't forget about the Burner!

01:08:18.346 --> 01:08:20.446
Yeah!

01:08:20.448 --> 01:08:22.147
Oh, shit!

01:08:22.149 --> 01:08:23.814
Oh!

01:08:23.817 --> 01:08:26.283
- What the fuck?
- Put him out! Put him out!

01:08:26.286 --> 01:08:27.822
- I got this!
- No, no, no!

01:08:29.291 --> 01:08:30.488
That's vodka!

01:08:30.491 --> 01:08:31.823
Are you kidding? Help!

01:08:31.826 --> 01:08:33.292
- I got it!
- No, no, no!

01:08:33.295 --> 01:08:34.662
That's vodka, too!

01:08:35.930 --> 01:08:37.497
Oh, God!

01:08:37.499 --> 01:08:39.365
Wait, no! That's polyester!

01:08:43.004 --> 01:08:45.504
I've got an idea. Everybody, back up!

01:08:45.506 --> 01:08:46.971
All right.

01:08:46.974 --> 01:08:48.307
Ouch!

01:08:48.309 --> 01:08:49.510
Stop!

01:08:51.246 --> 01:08:53.082
What's with these people?

01:08:54.349 --> 01:08:55.381
I did it!

01:08:55.384 --> 01:08:56.852
Frank!

01:08:57.986 --> 01:09:00.419
Frank, you saved his life.

01:09:00.421 --> 01:09:05.524
Everybody,
everything's gonna be just fine.

01:09:05.527 --> 01:09:07.830
I was wrong!

01:09:18.139 --> 01:09:20.240
I'm sorry.

01:09:20.242 --> 01:09:21.473
You were right about me.

01:09:21.475 --> 01:09:24.076
I will sign the divorce papers.

01:09:24.078 --> 01:09:25.810
As long as you print a new copy,

01:09:25.813 --> 01:09:28.113
'cause the ones that you gave
me burned up in the house.

01:09:28.116 --> 01:09:29.881
I fucked everything up.

01:09:29.884 --> 01:09:31.249
I know.

01:09:31.251 --> 01:09:34.252
But we have insurance.

01:09:34.255 --> 01:09:35.654
They don't know that I took

01:09:35.657 --> 01:09:37.622
all the furniture and jewelry and stuff.

01:09:37.625 --> 01:09:39.658
- Raina...
- What?

01:09:39.661 --> 01:09:40.926
Are you suggesting that

01:09:40.929 --> 01:09:43.261
we commit insurance fraud together?

01:09:43.264 --> 01:09:45.566
What, Frank? I'm just sayin'.

01:09:52.907 --> 01:09:54.507
That's one of the
most fucked-up things

01:09:54.509 --> 01:09:55.874
I've ever heard.

01:09:55.876 --> 01:09:57.509
But,

01:09:57.511 --> 01:09:59.544
you guys kind of did it all for me.

01:09:59.546 --> 01:10:02.414
So, thank you.

01:10:02.416 --> 01:10:04.950
Honey, don't thank us.

01:10:04.952 --> 01:10:08.555
The money's all gone.
You can't go to Bucknell.

01:10:08.557 --> 01:10:10.256
We are so sorry.

01:10:10.258 --> 01:10:12.191
We had it,

01:10:12.193 --> 01:10:14.994
but then Bob Schaeffer took it from us.

01:10:14.996 --> 01:10:17.963
The asshole that took my scholarship?

01:10:17.965 --> 01:10:20.266
If he stole it from us, why
don't we just steal it back?

01:10:20.268 --> 01:10:21.967
- No.
- 'Cause we don't do that anymore.

01:10:21.969 --> 01:10:23.436
Once you go to the dark side,

01:10:23.438 --> 01:10:24.704
it gets dark very quickly. Trust me.

01:10:24.706 --> 01:10:26.405
I see fingers everywhere.

01:10:26.407 --> 01:10:27.839
Are you guys serious?

01:10:27.841 --> 01:10:29.543
You've been doing this
insane stuff all summer,

01:10:29.545 --> 01:10:33.245
and now that I have a chance
to help, you just wanna quit?

01:10:33.247 --> 01:10:34.814
<i>Good afternoon, folks.</i>

01:10:34.816 --> 01:10:36.248
- Excuse me? Hello?
- Mom?

01:10:36.250 --> 01:10:38.583
Don't be alarmed. I'm
not here to arrest you.

01:10:38.585 --> 01:10:40.552
What you did was self-defense.

01:10:40.554 --> 01:10:42.321
We are alarmed, you're in our backyard.

01:10:42.323 --> 01:10:43.722
Ignore the badge.

01:10:43.724 --> 01:10:45.757
- Ignore the gun.
- Oh!

01:10:45.759 --> 01:10:46.926
- Shit!
- Put it down.

01:10:46.928 --> 01:10:48.494
- What are you doing?
- Put that down.

01:10:48.496 --> 01:10:51.196
This is nothing to be afraid of. Here.

01:10:52.367 --> 01:10:54.499
People being afraid of guns is silly.

01:10:54.501 --> 01:10:55.803
And I'm sick of it.

01:10:56.437 --> 01:10:57.736
<i>Anyway,</i>

01:10:57.738 --> 01:10:59.942
I'm just here to say one thing.

01:11:00.841 --> 01:11:02.741
Fuck Bob Schaeffer.

01:11:02.743 --> 01:11:04.377
He doesn't care about this town.

01:11:04.379 --> 01:11:06.178
Here's what we're gonna do.

01:11:06.180 --> 01:11:09.015
You're never gonna believe this, Bob.

01:11:09.017 --> 01:11:10.917
They never shut down the casino.

01:11:10.919 --> 01:11:12.886
They just moved it to another house.

01:11:12.888 --> 01:11:14.753
But I told them if they kept it open,

01:11:14.755 --> 01:11:17.289
that I would have them arrested.

01:11:17.291 --> 01:11:19.758
<i>There are
Smurfs who are taller</i>

01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:21.393
<i>than Bob Schaeffer.</i>

01:11:21.395 --> 01:11:24.597
<i>He looks like a gremlin
learned how to tie a tie.</i>

01:11:24.599 --> 01:11:26.031
<i>Don't get him wet after midnight.</i>

01:11:26.033 --> 01:11:27.534
<i>Hey, guys! I found the casino!</i>

01:11:27.536 --> 01:11:30.069
<i>For God sakes, I'm short!</i>

01:11:34.675 --> 01:11:36.275
They're making fun of you, Bob.

01:11:36.277 --> 01:11:37.810
<i>Hello, I'm Bob Schaeffer.</i>

01:11:37.812 --> 01:11:40.749
You told them to shut it down.

01:11:41.515 --> 01:11:43.285
Cop car. Now.

01:11:46.020 --> 01:11:48.156
Can't wait to see their
faces when we get there.

01:11:54.094 --> 01:11:55.563
Come on.

01:12:01.501 --> 01:12:03.703
Okay. Yeah, right there!

01:12:03.705 --> 01:12:05.171
Okay, here you go.

01:12:05.173 --> 01:12:06.241
Okay.

01:12:08.542 --> 01:12:09.909
All right.

01:12:09.911 --> 01:12:11.310
What's the combination?

01:12:11.312 --> 01:12:13.579
It's okay, I know.
Officer Chandler told me.

01:12:13.581 --> 01:12:15.249
And right now...

01:12:16.283 --> 01:12:19.121
I completely remember it.

01:12:20.522 --> 01:12:22.055
It's okay, I know, I know, I know.

01:12:22.057 --> 01:12:23.423
Dad, there's no time for this.

01:12:23.425 --> 01:12:24.923
Hide!

01:12:24.925 --> 01:12:26.525
- Hey, how's it going?
- Good.

01:12:26.527 --> 01:12:27.759
I need that by tomorrow.

01:12:27.761 --> 01:12:29.695
<i>- All right.
- No, I'm serious, though.</i>

01:12:29.697 --> 01:12:32.030
All right. Bye.

01:12:32.032 --> 01:12:33.966
Okay, Scott...

01:12:33.968 --> 01:12:36.401
- Honey, I have faith in you, okay?
- Yeah.

01:12:36.403 --> 01:12:41.341
I know that you can remember
four sequential numbers.

01:12:41.343 --> 01:12:43.211
Just think. Just think.

01:12:48.316 --> 01:12:50.583
Squiggly line.

01:12:50.585 --> 01:12:52.654
Is that part of the combination?

01:12:54.589 --> 01:12:57.190
- Poop. Poop emoji?
<i>- Uh-oh.</i>

01:12:57.192 --> 01:12:58.991
Is that part of it? No.

01:12:58.993 --> 01:13:01.259
I love you so much, Dad.

01:13:01.261 --> 01:13:04.066
I'm gonna miss you next year at college.

01:13:06.300 --> 01:13:08.500
29-52-41-78
pound.

01:13:08.502 --> 01:13:09.636
- Yes!
- I remember!

01:13:09.638 --> 01:13:10.770
You did! Good job!

01:13:10.772 --> 01:13:12.092
I'm gonna miss you, too, sweetie.

01:13:12.474 --> 01:13:13.838
Okay.

01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:15.643
Good job.

01:13:22.050 --> 01:13:23.051
Okay.

01:13:29.590 --> 01:13:31.624
Okay. Here we go. Here we go.

01:13:31.626 --> 01:13:32.757
Honey, there's wheels.

01:13:32.759 --> 01:13:33.860
I got it. What?

01:13:33.862 --> 01:13:35.026
- Dad! Dad!
- It's got wheels!

01:13:35.028 --> 01:13:36.596
- You can wheel it.
- Oh, it does.

01:13:36.598 --> 01:13:38.530
- Okay, yeah. So much easier.
- Just drag the suitcase.

01:13:38.532 --> 01:13:40.932
- Okay.
- Careful! The floor is slippery.

01:13:40.934 --> 01:13:42.167
Are you meeting with the Johansens?

01:13:42.169 --> 01:13:44.302
I think I saw them come into Town Hall.

01:13:44.304 --> 01:13:45.838
<i>Dawn, they can't be there.</i>

01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:47.039
<i>We're going to arrest
them right now.</i>

01:13:47.041 --> 01:13:48.710
Well, they're here somewhere.

01:13:51.345 --> 01:13:52.779
Your office door is open.

01:13:52.781 --> 01:13:54.146
<i>Wait, so is the safe.</i>

01:13:54.148 --> 01:13:56.882
What? I'm coming back! Go faster, Chandler.

01:13:56.884 --> 01:13:58.517
- I'm driving safely, Bob.
- Punch it!

01:13:58.519 --> 01:14:00.018
Bob, I'm going the speed limit.

01:14:00.020 --> 01:14:01.921
- Punch it, Chandler. Let's go.
- I won't.

01:14:01.923 --> 01:14:03.923
Back to Town Hall now!

01:14:03.925 --> 01:14:04.990
<i>- Stop it!
- You stop it!</i>

01:14:04.992 --> 01:14:06.158
<i>- Stop doing that!
- No!</i>

01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:08.430
- Stop it!
- Watch out, Chandler!

01:14:11.532 --> 01:14:13.399
That's why you don't punch it!

01:14:13.401 --> 01:14:16.004
Great, just great!

01:14:21.376 --> 01:14:23.810
Fuck you, Bob Schaeffer!

01:14:23.812 --> 01:14:26.945
- You wrecked my car! You pig!
- Stop it.

01:14:26.947 --> 01:14:29.181
- Bob!
- Look what you did!

01:14:29.183 --> 01:14:30.915
Ma'am, we have to exchange information!

01:14:30.917 --> 01:14:33.921
Fuck the police.

01:14:34.923 --> 01:14:37.522
- There you go.
- There we go.

01:15:06.586 --> 01:15:09.187
Your family fucking sucks!

01:15:11.125 --> 01:15:13.060
Stupid fucking money bag!

01:15:17.365 --> 01:15:19.501
No! Not the model!

01:15:23.972 --> 01:15:27.373
I handcuffed it to my
wrist, you fucking shithead!

01:15:27.375 --> 01:15:31.078
So, what are you gonna do
about it now, Scott Johansen?

01:15:35.249 --> 01:15:38.185
- You're not talking to Scott Johansen.
- What?

01:15:39.620 --> 01:15:40.718
You're talking to...

01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:41.887
No. No.

01:15:41.889 --> 01:15:43.890
- The Butcher.
- No!

01:15:48.028 --> 01:15:49.928
I thought you were gonna cut off my arm.

01:15:49.930 --> 01:15:52.265
So did I. I'm so glad I didn't do that.

01:15:52.267 --> 01:15:53.501
Oh, God.

01:15:56.071 --> 01:15:57.436
Oh, Chandler, God.

01:15:57.438 --> 01:15:59.637
Chandler, arrest these people, please.

01:15:59.639 --> 01:16:01.307
I don't think so, Bob.

01:16:01.309 --> 01:16:03.374
I like them a lot more than I like you.

01:16:03.376 --> 01:16:04.244
Hmm.

01:16:04.246 --> 01:16:05.645
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>

01:16:05.647 --> 01:16:07.680
- So, that's how it's gonna be?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

01:16:07.682 --> 01:16:09.615
Don't touch the fucking money.

01:16:09.617 --> 01:16:10.917
It's fine.

01:16:10.919 --> 01:16:12.451
All I need is my sweet, sweet Dawn.

01:16:12.453 --> 01:16:14.954
Bob, is that all cash
that you stole from them?

01:16:14.956 --> 01:16:16.055
<i>Yep.</i>

01:16:16.057 --> 01:16:17.656
- Yeah, he did.
- All of it.

01:16:17.658 --> 01:16:18.790
<i>- Mmm-hmm.</i>
- Come on!

01:16:18.792 --> 01:16:20.491
I took that money for us,

01:16:20.493 --> 01:16:22.026
for our future.

01:16:22.028 --> 01:16:23.361
What future? What are you talking about?

01:16:23.363 --> 01:16:25.196
I wanted you to be my First Lady.

01:16:25.198 --> 01:16:27.667
<i>You're never
gonna be president.</i>

01:16:27.669 --> 01:16:29.067
You're too short.

01:16:30.539 --> 01:16:32.305
Dawn?

01:16:32.307 --> 01:16:33.972
- What's going on in here?
- Joe...

01:16:33.974 --> 01:16:36.074
Oh, my God, the model.

01:16:36.076 --> 01:16:37.476
<i>And you know what, Bob?</i>

01:16:37.478 --> 01:16:39.744
I'm already somebody's First Lady.

01:16:39.746 --> 01:16:42.381
- No.
<i>- I'm coming in for a kiss right now.</i>

01:16:42.383 --> 01:16:44.419
Here I come.

01:16:45.286 --> 01:16:46.451
Mmm.

01:16:48.923 --> 01:16:50.955
Way to go, Joe.

01:16:50.957 --> 01:16:53.392
- Did I get you that necklace?
- What?

01:16:53.394 --> 01:16:55.794
- Yep.
<i>- You know what?</i>

01:16:55.796 --> 01:16:57.329
All I do is give!

01:16:57.331 --> 01:16:59.097
What about me?

01:16:59.099 --> 01:17:01.366
What about Bob?

01:17:02.469 --> 01:17:03.936
What's so funny?

01:17:03.938 --> 01:17:05.937
There's a movie. <i>What About Bob?</i>

01:17:05.939 --> 01:17:08.073
Yeah. Richard Dreyfuss, Bill Murray.

01:17:08.075 --> 01:17:10.642
Am I the only one who
doesn't get Bill Murray?

01:17:10.644 --> 01:17:13.412
- What?
- You're coming off like a real dipshit now.

01:17:13.414 --> 01:17:15.012
You're being a piece of shit, Bob.

01:17:15.014 --> 01:17:16.848
Don't judge me!

01:17:16.850 --> 01:17:18.484
Yeah, I took the money!

01:17:18.486 --> 01:17:20.351
I took the money from the Johansens

01:17:20.353 --> 01:17:22.454
and I took the money from the town.

01:17:22.456 --> 01:17:23.556
But I deserve it!

01:17:23.558 --> 01:17:25.658
I'm so glad you said that clearly, Bob.

01:17:25.660 --> 01:17:28.427
'Cause we've been recording
it on all of these cameras.

01:17:28.429 --> 01:17:30.329
What? What?

01:17:30.331 --> 01:17:32.631
Oh, God!

01:17:32.633 --> 01:17:33.966
I'm gonna go shoot Bob.

01:17:33.968 --> 01:17:35.301
No, no, no.

01:17:35.303 --> 01:17:37.268
- I'm gonna go arrest Bob.
<i>- That a boy!</i>

01:17:37.270 --> 01:17:38.537
Anyway, those cameras weren't turned on.

01:17:38.539 --> 01:17:40.006
I just said that to freak him out.

01:17:40.008 --> 01:17:41.573
- Are you kidding me?
- That was badass.

01:17:41.575 --> 01:17:42.641
I totally bought that!

01:17:42.643 --> 01:17:44.445
Come on. Let's go, guys, huh?

01:17:58.626 --> 01:18:00.261
- It's okay.
- It's okay.

01:18:01.763 --> 01:18:03.131
You got it.

01:18:05.500 --> 01:18:07.135
I love you guys.

01:18:10.438 --> 01:18:12.507
Thanks for getting me into college.

01:18:18.645 --> 01:18:20.247
You okay?

01:18:22.283 --> 01:18:23.649
Yeah.

01:18:23.651 --> 01:18:24.917
Yeah, you?

01:18:24.919 --> 01:18:26.121
Yeah.
