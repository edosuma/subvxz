00:41.166 --> 00:44.166
(mellow music playing)

00:45.700 --> 00:46.500
(Dorothy) Bye-bye.

00:46.567 --> 00:48.133
Bye, y'all.

00:49.033 --> 00:50.967
-Bye-bye.
-And drive carefully!

00:51.033 --> 00:52.266
This wind is terrible.

00:52.333 --> 00:54.500
-See you next week.
-Good bye!

00:55.033 --> 00:58.500
-Oh!
-Oh, what a party!

00:58.567 --> 01:02.800
Oh, Ma, I tell you,
that meal was absolutely incredible.

01:02.867 --> 01:05.800
Oh, it was fantastic, Sophia,
really fantastic.

01:05.867 --> 01:07.066
I know, I know.

01:08.500 --> 01:10.300
Did you see that Emma Jane eat?

01:10.367 --> 01:12.600
-Oh.
-I could not believe my eyes.

01:12.667 --> 01:16.900
That woman must weigh 275 pounds.
She never stopped shoving it in.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.333
And then she had to talk the entire time.

01:20.400 --> 01:22.734
She just sprayed food all over the table.

01:22.800 --> 01:26.133
Like a mist! I got it in my hair.
It was hitting me like pellets.

01:27.400 --> 01:31.834
I got a piece of rice in my eye.
She could have put my eye out.

01:32.734 --> 01:35.333
Well, I never had food like that
in my life.

01:35.400 --> 01:38.166
Now, I spent a summer in Italy
four years ago.

01:38.233 --> 01:39.934
I never ate this well.

01:40.367 --> 01:41.600
'Course, I never ate.

01:41.667 --> 01:44.767
Who had the time or the energy?
If you get my drift.

01:45.233 --> 01:46.033
No.

01:46.467 --> 01:47.600
Oh, Rose.

01:48.066 --> 01:50.300
Italian men are just the sexiest,

01:50.367 --> 01:53.967
most romantic,
most gorgeous men in the world.

01:54.033 --> 01:55.734
And of course, they just worshipped me

01:55.800 --> 01:59.900
'cause I'm blond and feminine
and young, with a great body.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.233
What mirror do you use?

02:04.700 --> 02:08.266
Oh, Sophia, now, you've done enough.
Girls, we're doing the dishes.

02:08.333 --> 02:09.133
You just sit.

02:09.200 --> 02:12.233
Fine with me. I'm exhausted.
I've been cooking for two days.

02:12.300 --> 02:15.567
I offered to help you, Sophia,
but you said "no."

02:15.633 --> 02:16.867
You're Scandinavian.

02:16.934 --> 02:18.934
What do you know,
a thousand ways to make herring?

02:19.000 --> 02:21.633
(chuckles)
Well, not a thousand, but a lot,

02:21.700 --> 02:24.100
and I'm famous for my Lindstrom surprise.

02:24.533 --> 02:25.967
What in the world is that?

02:26.033 --> 02:27.333
Herring pie.

02:28.400 --> 02:31.867
The surprise is,
you think it's pie, like apple,

02:31.934 --> 02:34.567
but when you bite into it, it's herring!

02:35.467 --> 02:38.000
(laughs)
Oh, what fun.

02:40.934 --> 02:41.967
It was.

02:43.967 --> 02:45.834
My cat was named Lindstrom.

02:45.900 --> 02:48.633
I used to make it for him
on his birthday and other holidays.

02:48.700 --> 02:50.700
Wait a minute,
your last name was Lindstrom.

02:50.767 --> 02:52.800
You named your cat Lindstrom Lindstrom?

02:52.867 --> 02:54.700
Yes, it was less confusing for him.

02:55.934 --> 02:58.200
I'm gonna clear the stuff from inside.

02:58.767 --> 03:01.266
-She's something.
-A real pistol.

03:01.333 --> 03:02.533
The energy she has.

03:02.600 --> 03:04.533
Look at this meal she made.
It's just incredible.

03:05.734 --> 03:08.233
You know what? She's in the other room
starting to clear up.

03:08.300 --> 03:09.967
-We can't let her do that.
-Oh, you're right.

03:10.033 --> 03:12.066
Come on. She's done enough for one night.

03:12.600 --> 03:15.033
-Ma, now listen--
-Oh, boy!

03:15.734 --> 03:17.467
I ate too much scungilli.

03:18.100 --> 03:19.033
What's the matter?

03:19.567 --> 03:20.700
I got a bubble.

03:21.467 --> 03:23.000
Why are you rubbing your chest?

03:23.500 --> 03:25.300
The bubble is in my chest.

03:25.367 --> 03:27.967
What do you mean, you have a bubble?
Is it pain?

03:28.033 --> 03:30.667
If it was pain, I'd call it pain.
I have a bubble.

03:31.400 --> 03:33.533
Blanche, do you know what a bubble is?

03:33.967 --> 03:35.767
I know what a bauble is.
(chuckles)

03:36.233 --> 03:38.400
I know what it is. I've had a bubble.

03:38.467 --> 03:39.867
In your head.

03:41.834 --> 03:45.333
A bubble is something
that just sits there and presses

03:45.400 --> 03:49.100
until it's chased away by a you-know-what.

03:49.600 --> 03:51.800
No. What, Rose, a highway patrolman?

03:53.166 --> 03:54.867
-Dorothy.
-What?

03:55.800 --> 03:57.567
A big belch.

03:57.633 --> 04:00.500
You couldn't say "belch"?
What is it, a Viking curse?

04:01.500 --> 04:04.066
Well, it's not the nicest word
in the world.

04:04.133 --> 04:06.467
Right now, it would be
the nicest sound in the world.

04:07.500 --> 04:09.467
Ma, you know, you don't look good.

04:09.533 --> 04:12.600
I'm short and I'm old.
What did you expect, Princess Di?

04:14.400 --> 04:16.433
I think we should call the doctor.

04:16.500 --> 04:19.200
-I don't need a doctor.
-Blanche, would you call, please?

04:19.266 --> 04:21.066
The number's by my bed. Dr. Harris.

04:21.133 --> 04:22.567
I hate doctors.

04:22.633 --> 04:26.367
The only doctor I ever liked
was Dr. Clyde, our vet.

04:26.767 --> 04:27.967
He was wonderful.

04:28.433 --> 04:30.600
My mother wanted him to do
her hysterectomy,

04:30.667 --> 04:31.500
but he wouldn't.

04:33.934 --> 04:36.233
But he was willing to do her lobotomy.

04:37.767 --> 04:38.967
Ohh!

04:39.033 --> 04:40.100
What, Ma? What?

04:40.166 --> 04:42.433
-Pain.
-What kind of pain?

04:42.500 --> 04:43.767
The kind that hurts.

04:44.467 --> 04:46.567
Ma, lie down. Just lie down.

04:46.633 --> 04:48.867
Dorothy, what if I'm having
a heart attack?

04:48.934 --> 04:50.166
You're not having a heart attack.

04:50.233 --> 04:51.900
How do you know? You're not a doctor.

04:51.967 --> 04:53.300
You're not having a heart attack.

04:53.367 --> 04:55.100
Why do you think
you're having a heart attack?

04:55.166 --> 04:57.934
I'm 80 years old,
I got Pavarotti sitting on my chest.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.400
Odds are it's a heart attack!

04:59.467 --> 05:02.133
The doctor was out,
but they're trying to locate him.

05:02.200 --> 05:04.433
So, I called the paramedics,
and they're on the way.

05:04.500 --> 05:05.433
Oh, great, great.

05:05.500 --> 05:07.834
Dorothy, do we have heart disease
in our family?

05:07.900 --> 05:08.834
No, Ma.

05:08.900 --> 05:10.333
How did uncle Mario die?

05:10.400 --> 05:11.934
Don't you remember?

05:12.000 --> 05:15.100
He was carrying out the garbage
and dropped his gun,

05:15.166 --> 05:17.266
and it went off
and shot him in the forehead.

05:17.734 --> 05:20.266
Oh, yeah, right. What a klutz.

05:21.967 --> 05:23.834
Didn't Aunt Teresa have a heart attack?

05:23.900 --> 05:25.934
Aunt Teresa didn't have a heart.

05:27.767 --> 05:28.734
Uncle Nunzio?

05:28.800 --> 05:32.033
Uncle Nunzio died to get away
from Aunt Teresa.

05:33.567 --> 05:36.867
My mother died of old age,
and my father fell off a donkey,

05:36.934 --> 05:38.533
so we got healthy hearts in our family.

05:38.600 --> 05:40.533
Very, very healthy.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.834
That's good. That's a good thing.

05:42.900 --> 05:46.834
There shouldn't be heart attacks
or cancer, or anything like that.

05:47.367 --> 05:51.200
There should just be a certain age
where you have to turn your life in,

05:51.266 --> 05:52.600
like a library book.

05:53.400 --> 05:55.700
You pack a bag, you go, and that's that.

05:55.767 --> 05:57.266
I wouldn't know what to pack.

05:58.467 --> 06:01.367
Of course, you know the real question is,
do they have dry cleaners there?

06:01.667 --> 06:05.033
Well, dry cleaners die.
There's probably a slew of dry cleaners.

06:05.100 --> 06:07.367
-Will you two please shut up?
-Oh!

06:07.433 --> 06:09.233
-I'm s--
-How about if I make a pot of coffee

06:09.300 --> 06:11.967
-while we're waiting?
-Great. Good idea. Thanks, Blanche.

06:13.567 --> 06:14.533
Rose.

06:15.166 --> 06:16.400
Oh, I'll come help.

06:18.967 --> 06:20.066
What if I die, Dorothy?

06:20.133 --> 06:24.033
Ma, you're not going to die.
Now, look, I don't want you to talk.

06:24.100 --> 06:25.300
Just rest.

06:25.367 --> 06:27.867
Rest? I could be history in 20 minutes.

06:27.934 --> 06:29.834
I got some things I have to tell you.

06:29.900 --> 06:32.467
The key to my safe-deposit box,
it's in my underwear drawer.

06:32.533 --> 06:33.800
-Oh, Ma, please.
-Don't interrupt.

06:33.867 --> 06:36.767
Don't let your Aunt Renata
come to the services.

06:36.834 --> 06:39.000
It's my death. She'll make it her moment.

06:39.600 --> 06:43.000
-Ma, look--
-Dorothy, you were always my favorite.

06:43.066 --> 06:44.367
I want you to know that.

06:45.266 --> 06:48.033
Maybe I didn't show it.
I'm not an affectionate person.

06:48.800 --> 06:49.667
But you are.

06:50.600 --> 06:52.900
Don't tell your sister,
and keep the silver.

06:54.700 --> 06:55.800
Ok, Ma.

06:56.266 --> 06:58.934
You know, I'll probably see
your father in heaven.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.300
I haven't seen him in 30 years.

07:02.333 --> 07:04.367
I wish there was time to get my hair done.

07:06.600 --> 07:08.333
Maybe it isn't a heart attack.

07:08.400 --> 07:10.567
Oh, Rose, honey, she's 80.
At 80, something's got to go.

07:11.033 --> 07:14.300
Well, not necessarily.
My grandparents lived till their 90s.

07:14.367 --> 07:16.000
One was 102.

07:16.066 --> 07:17.266
In Minnesota.

07:17.633 --> 07:18.433
So?

07:18.900 --> 07:22.000
Rose, you know how they freeze
dead people to preserve them

07:22.066 --> 07:23.333
and then bring them back?

07:24.633 --> 07:26.500
That's like living in Minnesota.

07:28.734 --> 07:32.000
The cold slows down the aging process.

07:32.066 --> 07:35.300
Oh, I would move there in a shot
if only they had men there.

07:36.734 --> 07:38.233
We have men in Minnesota.

07:38.300 --> 07:41.100
Farmers, Rose. Farmers.

07:43.500 --> 07:44.567
I'm an idiot.

07:44.633 --> 07:45.600
Why?

07:45.667 --> 07:47.166
I didn't think this would happen.

07:47.233 --> 07:48.066
What?

07:48.133 --> 07:50.200
Death. I didn't really think I'd die.

07:50.266 --> 07:53.633
Ma, maybe someday, but not today.
(laughs)

07:53.700 --> 07:56.800
It could be today, and you know what?
I'm not ready.

07:56.867 --> 07:59.734
80 years old, and it would come
as a complete surprise.

08:01.567 --> 08:04.834
Ma, you're ok. You are not going to die.

08:04.900 --> 08:05.700
I don't want to.

08:05.767 --> 08:06.967
Who does?

08:07.567 --> 08:10.467
You know,
I'd settle for even just one more day.

08:11.200 --> 08:13.734
God knows why.
Tomorrow I'm cleaning the closets.

08:16.367 --> 08:17.467
Ma, I love you.

08:17.533 --> 08:18.667
You know what, Dorothy?

08:18.734 --> 08:19.633
What?

08:19.700 --> 08:20.800
Death sucks.

08:23.433 --> 08:25.300
Do you want to be buried or cremated?

08:25.367 --> 08:26.400
Neither.

08:26.467 --> 08:28.767
What do you want to be,
flushed down the toilet like a goldfish?

08:31.100 --> 08:32.700
I wouldn't want to be cremated.

08:32.767 --> 08:34.033
I hate heat.

08:34.633 --> 08:37.800
And burial? I hate small spaces.

08:37.867 --> 08:39.767
I'm a little claustrophobic.

08:39.834 --> 08:42.300
Rose, you're not gonna know anything.
You're gonna be dead.

08:42.934 --> 08:43.734
Oh.

08:44.300 --> 08:46.300
Well, then, burial, I guess.

08:46.867 --> 08:49.066
But will you promise to put a blanket in
with me?

08:49.667 --> 08:50.867
Why?

08:50.934 --> 08:52.700
Oh, I'd just feel more comfortable.

08:53.166 --> 08:54.333
Cozier.

08:55.066 --> 08:57.967
And I'd want my pictures of Charlie
and the animals.

08:58.033 --> 09:00.200
You know,
the ones in the little silver frames.

09:00.266 --> 09:02.400
And... and my pictures of the children.

09:02.467 --> 09:06.400
And, of course, if I'm married again,
I'd want a picture of my new husband.

09:07.700 --> 09:11.667
-And the candlesticks mama gave me--
-Rose, it's a coffin, not a condo.

09:16.867 --> 09:19.467
This is a very depressing conversation.

09:19.533 --> 09:21.266
Well, I want a fancy funeral.

09:21.333 --> 09:24.066
I want a big parade
with a riderless horse,

09:24.133 --> 09:28.266
and then I want to lie in state
and then be buried in Arlington Cemetery.

09:30.533 --> 09:32.266
Why Arlington Cemetery?

09:32.333 --> 09:33.300
'Cause it's full of men.

09:35.266 --> 09:36.367
But they're all dead.

09:36.934 --> 09:38.066
So are the men I date.

09:38.834 --> 09:41.367
And I'm sorry I never tried acting.

09:41.433 --> 09:43.033
I always wanted to act.

09:43.100 --> 09:44.133
Coffee's ready.

09:44.200 --> 09:45.800
Oh, thanks, Blanche.

09:45.867 --> 09:47.867
Sophia, you feel a little better?

09:49.200 --> 09:51.934
-Oh, my God, she's--
-I'm not dead, I'm resting.

09:53.400 --> 09:55.433
Of course, you're not dead.

09:55.500 --> 09:56.467
-Not yet.
-Oh, Ma.

09:56.533 --> 09:58.266
Don't "Ma" me. Listen.

09:58.800 --> 10:00.700
Before you know it, I could be gone,

10:00.767 --> 10:03.266
and we won't have said
some important stuff.

10:03.934 --> 10:05.433
I love you, Dorothy.

10:05.867 --> 10:09.166
Just remember that I love you
very, very much.

10:10.100 --> 10:15.633
And I love you, Ma, very, very much.
I couldn't love you more.

10:16.600 --> 10:18.266
And you two, Heckle and Jeckle.

10:22.767 --> 10:24.500
Thank you for letting me live here.

10:24.567 --> 10:25.867
It was some treat.

10:26.467 --> 10:28.667
You made an old lady feel young again.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.066
You're ok.

10:31.133 --> 10:34.367
-We love you, Sophia.
-We sure do.

10:34.967 --> 10:37.200
This is nice, to die with friends.

10:39.467 --> 10:42.667
I'm gonna close my eyes now,
but I'm only resting.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.300
Oh, God, where are the paramedics?

10:46.367 --> 10:47.600
I'll go call them again.

10:47.667 --> 10:49.066
Rose, you stay with Dorothy.

10:49.834 --> 10:53.834
Oh, Dorothy, she'll be fine.
I'm sure it isn't a heart attack.

10:54.166 --> 10:55.567
A heart attack's bigger.

10:55.633 --> 10:57.033
I've seen a heart attack.

10:57.100 --> 10:58.400
Charlie had a heart attack.

10:58.467 --> 11:00.700
-And it wasn't like this?
-Oh, it was much worse.

11:00.767 --> 11:03.100
If only the paramedics would get here.

11:04.066 --> 11:06.700
Charlie made me dress him
when he had his heart attack,

11:06.767 --> 11:08.133
before the paramedics got there.

11:08.734 --> 11:10.033
But he wasn't dressed?

11:11.300 --> 11:13.734
We were, uh, making love.

11:14.533 --> 11:19.800
Oh, Rose, honey, you never told me.
He died while you were making love?

11:20.166 --> 11:21.667
He didn't die then.

11:21.734 --> 11:27.333
He had his heart attack then,
and he told me to dress him.

11:28.367 --> 11:29.166
And?

11:29.834 --> 11:30.867
And I dressed him.

11:31.633 --> 11:33.066
And then we had a fight.

11:33.567 --> 11:36.967
I grabbed a pair of white pants,
and I was putting them on him,

11:37.033 --> 11:39.934
and Charlie said it was after Labor Day
and he couldn't wear white.

11:42.367 --> 11:44.300
In the middle of a heart attack?
(chuckles)

11:44.367 --> 11:48.433
Oh, Charlie was very stubborn
and very dapper.

11:49.633 --> 11:52.066
And then what happened?

11:52.567 --> 11:55.433
And he told me he loved me, and...

11:56.233 --> 11:57.233
Then it was over.

11:58.900 --> 12:04.100
And I put a pair of gray flannel pants
on him and a blue shirt,

12:05.066 --> 12:06.367
and a striped tie,

12:07.700 --> 12:10.333
and he was all dressed
when the paramedics got there.

12:10.667 --> 12:11.467
(door opens)

12:12.033 --> 12:14.367
Girls, come here a minute.

12:14.633 --> 12:16.433
Listen, it's gonna be a while.

12:16.500 --> 12:19.967
There's lots of trees down
and accidents because of the storm,

12:20.033 --> 12:22.300
so the paramedics
can't get through right away.

12:22.367 --> 12:24.900
Oh, we have to do something.
She needs help.

12:24.967 --> 12:26.400
We can drive her to the hospital.

12:26.467 --> 12:28.934
The hospital's 20 minutes from here.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.800
If the paramedics can't get through,
what makes you think we can?

12:31.867 --> 12:33.500
We could get out there and get stuck.

12:33.567 --> 12:35.266
I think we ought to just wait for help.

12:35.333 --> 12:38.500
-But she could be dying.
-But what can we do?

12:40.166 --> 12:40.967
Pray.

12:41.734 --> 12:43.433
Wait and... and pray.

12:44.900 --> 12:47.900
(somber music playing)

13:05.667 --> 13:07.300
Aah!

13:07.367 --> 13:08.166
Oh!

13:08.734 --> 13:09.934
What, Ma? What?

13:10.400 --> 13:12.133
What? You're sitting on top of me,

13:12.200 --> 13:13.834
I open my eyes, I see pores like that,

13:13.900 --> 13:14.867
I think I'm on the moon.

13:16.166 --> 13:18.700
Did you have a nice nap, Sophia?

13:18.767 --> 13:20.066
I didn't have a nap.

13:20.133 --> 13:21.967
I died a little. I went to heaven.

13:22.033 --> 13:24.734
Oh, Ma. You just slept, is all.

13:24.800 --> 13:25.834
You were there?

13:25.900 --> 13:28.333
Don't tell me where I went.
I went to heaven.

13:28.400 --> 13:32.867
I saw the golden light and some angels
in white robes with harps.

13:32.934 --> 13:36.600
I thought I was at Saks at Christmas,
but then I saw your father.

13:36.667 --> 13:37.734
Really?

13:37.800 --> 13:40.000
He was surrounded by women.

13:40.066 --> 13:41.200
He's in heaven.

13:42.300 --> 13:45.100
Did you see God and Jesus?

13:45.166 --> 13:46.233
They were busy.

13:47.433 --> 13:49.367
-I think I'll go back.
-Ma, don't go.

13:49.433 --> 13:50.600
No, Dorothy.

13:50.667 --> 13:53.133
It's a wonderful place.
I'm very excited about it.

13:53.200 --> 13:54.700
Ma, I want you here.

13:54.767 --> 13:58.100
-Sophia, are there lots of men in heaven?
-Oh, Blanche.

13:59.100 --> 14:00.233
I'd like to know.

14:00.700 --> 14:03.200
Dorothy, get me my rosary.

14:04.266 --> 14:05.400
I'll be right back.

14:06.800 --> 14:07.934
Listen, Sophia.

14:08.700 --> 14:10.400
What about men?
Are there lots of men in heaven?

14:10.467 --> 14:12.133
Oh, Blanche, come on.

14:12.200 --> 14:15.133
Well, you asked her about God and Jesus.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.200
Is there anything else
we can get you, Sophia?

14:20.266 --> 14:21.433
A little tea, perhaps?

14:21.500 --> 14:23.967
I'm not in England.
I'm having a heart attack.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.166
Keep her company.

14:27.233 --> 14:28.533
I'm gonna help Dorothy.

14:35.000 --> 14:40.567
Sophia, you know, I always thought
there'd be a catholic heaven,

14:40.633 --> 14:44.100
with nuns and priests and churches,

14:44.166 --> 14:46.700
and then a separate, protestant heaven,

14:47.367 --> 14:51.066
with people and cows and horses,

14:51.967 --> 14:56.900
and then a Jewish heaven,
with libraries and furriers and...

14:58.166 --> 15:01.433
You're starting to annoy me.
You shouldn't annoy a sick person.

15:01.500 --> 15:04.567
Oh, Sophia, I'm sorry.
I'm just trying to help.

15:05.033 --> 15:06.166
You wanna help?

15:06.233 --> 15:07.367
Be quiet.

15:08.400 --> 15:12.533
I'll be quiet, but just don't close
your eyes, all right?

15:13.133 --> 15:15.567
Don't... don't close your eyes.

15:20.233 --> 15:22.033
-Did you find them?
-No.

15:23.767 --> 15:26.200
Ooh, Blanche, what if she dies?

15:27.834 --> 15:31.300
She's a tough lady, Dorothy.
If anyone's a survivor, she is.

15:31.767 --> 15:33.667
If she dies, I'll be an orphan.

15:36.367 --> 15:37.700
Can you believe it?

15:37.767 --> 15:40.900
I'm over 50 years old,
and I'll still feel like an orphan.

15:41.233 --> 15:42.033
I know.

15:43.266 --> 15:44.734
Oh, it doesn't matter.

15:44.800 --> 15:47.133
You lose a parent,
you might as well be six.

15:48.300 --> 15:53.533
It's scary, and it pushes you right up
to the head of the line.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.033
I know.

15:57.967 --> 15:59.900
Oh, God, I don't know what I'll do.

16:00.900 --> 16:02.834
I love that lady so much.

16:03.734 --> 16:05.200
She's my family.

16:06.367 --> 16:09.233
We're your family too, Dorothy,
and you remember that.

16:09.734 --> 16:11.900
We might not be blood, but we're here.

16:13.900 --> 16:16.100
Oh, God, I miss her already.

16:17.700 --> 16:20.500
So, there I was with no vet,

16:20.567 --> 16:23.166
and petunia was about to give birth
to her piglets.

16:23.900 --> 16:27.100
(sighs)
Well, I just didn't know what to do.

16:27.633 --> 16:30.066
I mean,
I had helped deliver Bessie the cow,

16:30.133 --> 16:32.533
but petunia was so much more difficult.
She--

16:32.600 --> 16:35.533
If I died,
would you stop telling this story?

16:37.633 --> 16:39.233
Sophia, I'm sorry.

16:39.300 --> 16:41.367
I was just trying to get your mind
off things.

16:41.834 --> 16:43.300
I want my mind on things.

16:43.367 --> 16:46.367
I've got to make my peace,
and I need some peace to do it.

16:47.300 --> 16:48.333
I'll be quiet.

16:48.400 --> 16:49.300
Thank you.

16:49.934 --> 16:52.900
Here are your beads, Ma.
I found them in a can of peanut brittle.

16:54.800 --> 16:56.400
Of course. That's where I keep them.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.200
-(doorbell rings)
-Oh, the paramedics.

16:59.266 --> 17:01.133
Do I have lipstick on my teeth?

17:02.734 --> 17:05.533
Oh, Dr. Harris, thank God you're here.

17:06.033 --> 17:06.834
Here she is.

17:08.934 --> 17:11.333
So, what's this, Sophia?
I hear we're not feeling well.

17:11.400 --> 17:13.066
We? What are you, a partner?

17:14.367 --> 17:15.467
Where's the pain?

17:15.533 --> 17:16.633
My heart.

17:16.700 --> 17:17.567
Show me where.

17:17.867 --> 17:18.667
Here.

17:20.300 --> 17:22.100
You hungry? You want some food?

17:22.166 --> 17:24.400
We got a lot left over.
Dorothy, fix him a plate.

17:24.467 --> 17:25.367
Later, Ma.

17:25.433 --> 17:26.667
Now, breathe normally.

17:27.133 --> 17:29.266
Later I could be dead.
I won't know whether he liked it.

17:29.333 --> 17:31.500
Sophia, please. I can't hear.

17:31.567 --> 17:32.800
And I ate at my mother's.

17:32.867 --> 17:34.033
What did you eat?

17:34.100 --> 17:35.233
Kreplach.

17:35.300 --> 17:36.100
You're Jewish?

17:36.967 --> 17:39.533
All right, now, relax.

17:40.033 --> 17:42.000
How come so many doctors are Jewish?

17:42.066 --> 17:43.500
Because their mothers are.

17:47.767 --> 17:50.266
-Oh, oh, oh, oh!
-Did that hurt?

17:50.333 --> 17:52.900
No, I'm singing rock 'n' roll.
Of course, it hurts.

17:53.800 --> 17:54.934
What did you have for dinner?

17:55.300 --> 17:56.633
I didn't have any dinner.

17:56.700 --> 17:58.867
All right,
tell me everything you ate today.

17:59.500 --> 18:01.533
I don't know.
A little of this, a little of that.

18:01.600 --> 18:03.834
Wait a minute, she had the scungilli.

18:03.900 --> 18:06.233
And I saw her eat some sausages
and peppers.

18:06.300 --> 18:09.967
I saw her eat some fettuccine alfredo,
and fried mozzarella.

18:10.033 --> 18:11.033
Are you kidding?

18:11.100 --> 18:13.300
And then this afternoon,
she had the cannelloni

18:13.367 --> 18:16.200
and the mushrooms with gorgonzola.

18:16.667 --> 18:18.800
Bring him a plate of those.
Those were great.

18:18.867 --> 18:19.967
Rose, go!

18:20.033 --> 18:23.800
Oh, and the milk duds, remember?
You had those two boxes of milk duds.

18:26.100 --> 18:27.467
Milk duds?

18:27.800 --> 18:31.200
They're delicious. I love them.
The trouble is, they take out my dentures.

18:31.867 --> 18:34.500
Sophia, I don't think
you're having a heart attack.

18:34.934 --> 18:38.100
It's most likely a gallbladder attack
brought on by overeating.

18:38.667 --> 18:39.834
Overeating, by the way,

18:39.900 --> 18:42.400
is a gross understatement
for what you've described to me.

18:43.133 --> 18:46.066
You simply cannot go on eating like that
at your age!

18:46.934 --> 18:48.400
You can't eat like that at any age.

18:49.633 --> 18:52.900
But she didn't have a heart attack?
You're absolutely sure?

18:52.967 --> 18:55.000
I've got a portable EKG machine
in the car.

18:55.066 --> 18:56.166
I'll double-check, of course,

18:56.633 --> 18:58.266
but it doesn't seem like a heart attack.

18:58.333 --> 19:00.500
She's got classic gallbladder symptoms.

19:00.567 --> 19:02.533
A tenderness in the upper right quadrant,

19:02.600 --> 19:05.633
a slight discoloration
of the whites of her eyes.

19:05.700 --> 19:07.533
Try this and tell me you're not in heaven.

19:07.600 --> 19:08.800
Sophia, I can't, really.

19:08.867 --> 19:10.600
One bite, for God's sake!

19:12.800 --> 19:14.433
Isn't it a little rude for him
to be eating

19:14.500 --> 19:16.000
while she's having a heart attack?

19:19.066 --> 19:20.600
She's not having a heart attack.

19:21.066 --> 19:21.934
Mmm.

19:22.467 --> 19:23.433
That's good.

19:23.500 --> 19:24.433
Give me one of those.

19:24.500 --> 19:25.533
Hide this stuff!

19:27.500 --> 19:28.700
Where shall I hide it?

19:28.767 --> 19:30.233
In your brassiere, Rose.

19:32.367 --> 19:33.433
Just throw it away.

19:34.033 --> 19:35.700
I'm gonna get the EKG machine.

19:36.133 --> 19:37.066
I'll be right back.

19:37.500 --> 19:40.533
I'll call the paramedics
and tell them not to come.

19:40.600 --> 19:44.166
-Oh, thanks, Blanche.
-Dorothy, is he single or what?

19:44.734 --> 19:45.533
Or what.

19:47.066 --> 19:47.867
Happily?

19:48.300 --> 19:49.100
Happily.

19:49.633 --> 19:50.433
Damn.

19:56.734 --> 19:59.300
(chuckling)
Boy, what a relief.

19:59.967 --> 20:01.200
You're telling me.

20:01.266 --> 20:02.767
I thought I was a goner.

20:03.266 --> 20:04.300
It's incredible.

20:04.367 --> 20:07.567
You think you're dying,
you feel death enter your body.

20:07.633 --> 20:09.500
A doctor comes, he says you're fine,

20:09.567 --> 20:11.333
you're ready to swim the English Channel.

20:12.700 --> 20:14.433
I can't tell you how happy I am.

20:15.300 --> 20:18.900
I want you around for a long, long time.

20:18.967 --> 20:20.467
They'll have to murder me.

20:20.900 --> 20:21.967
Though, I must admit,

20:22.033 --> 20:24.767
I was a little excited
about seeing your father again.

20:26.033 --> 20:27.433
Ma, you feeling ok?

20:27.500 --> 20:28.533
I'll live.

20:30.033 --> 20:32.533
Listen, I'm sorry if I scared you.

20:32.600 --> 20:34.734
Oh, honey, don't worry about it.

20:34.800 --> 20:36.800
I'm just thrilled that you're ok and...

20:37.233 --> 20:40.667
'Cause I'm happy that,
you know, I'm your favorite.

20:41.700 --> 20:43.333
What are you talking about, favorite?

20:44.300 --> 20:47.266
You know, you told me
that I'm your favorite.

20:47.734 --> 20:50.266
Please! What favorite?
Are you kidding?

20:50.333 --> 20:51.433
I thought I was dying.

20:53.800 --> 20:54.900
Favorite?

20:56.433 --> 20:59.433
(mellow music playing)

21:03.967 --> 21:05.200
Boy, what a night.

21:05.266 --> 21:06.400
-(sighs)
-(tongue clicks)

21:06.467 --> 21:07.834
You said it.

21:08.266 --> 21:09.633
It sure makes you think.

21:12.600 --> 21:14.500
-Sure does.
-(sighs)

21:16.767 --> 21:17.633
About what?

21:28.133 --> 21:30.400
About our policy in Guatemala.

21:33.600 --> 21:35.533
About death, Rose.

21:36.200 --> 21:37.433
Oh, death.

21:38.600 --> 21:40.166
Are you prepared...

21:41.233 --> 21:45.100
Either of you?
I mean, really prepared for death?

21:45.567 --> 21:48.367
For somebody else's death.
I have a stunning black dress.

21:50.400 --> 21:54.500
Well, if I thought about it, you know,
the fact that I will die,

21:55.200 --> 22:00.133
then how can I take seriously
most of the things I take seriously?

22:00.200 --> 22:01.000
Like?

22:01.066 --> 22:03.500
Like eating, for example.

22:03.567 --> 22:07.300
I mean, why starve myself
to the point of thinness

22:07.367 --> 22:09.467
if I know that I could die tomorrow?

22:09.533 --> 22:12.100
I mean, why not eat the chocolate cake?

22:12.567 --> 22:13.533
What chocolate cake?

22:14.033 --> 22:16.166
The chocolate cake in the refrigerator.

22:21.233 --> 22:23.333
You know, you have a point, Dorothy.

22:24.767 --> 22:28.600
Here we are, not eating chocolate cake,
which we obviously adore,

22:28.667 --> 22:31.934
because we want to stay very thin
and then drop dead.

22:32.000 --> 22:32.934
That's nuts.

22:35.967 --> 22:38.233
But we might be thin and stay alive.

22:38.300 --> 22:41.300
But not forever, Rose.
We're not gonna stay alive forever.

22:41.367 --> 22:42.533
That's Dorothy's point.

22:42.600 --> 22:45.066
When you're gonna die in the end anyhow,
what's it matter?

22:45.133 --> 22:46.934
Yeah, I mean, what does it matter

22:47.000 --> 22:50.266
if you know that you're gonna end up
dying anyway,

22:50.333 --> 22:52.233
you might as well do what you want to do.

22:52.300 --> 22:54.734
Like having ice cream
on the chocolate cake.

22:56.133 --> 22:57.900
You know, I knew someone

22:57.967 --> 23:00.533
who went to this fabulous restaurant
in Paris

23:00.834 --> 23:03.600
and just had watercress for lunch

23:03.667 --> 23:05.467
because, you know,
she didn't want to gain weight.

23:06.233 --> 23:09.266
And then after lunch,
she walked out of the restaurant,

23:09.333 --> 23:14.333
and a gargoyle fell off the building,
hit her on the head and killed her.

23:14.400 --> 23:15.567
(Blanche) Oh, no.

23:16.133 --> 23:18.633
Look at what her last meal was.

23:21.200 --> 23:24.700
That is tragic, just tragic.

23:24.767 --> 23:25.633
Here, honey, dig in.

23:25.700 --> 23:27.233
'Course, it will be just my luck.

23:27.300 --> 23:29.867
I'll eat, I'll gain 40 pounds
and live to be 90.

23:31.200 --> 23:33.433
Me, too. I'm healthy as a horse.

23:33.500 --> 23:36.033
Unfortunately,
I'll wind up looking like one.

23:38.600 --> 23:41.333
You know,
all it takes is one little dessert,

23:41.400 --> 23:43.133
and my panties cut off my circulation.

23:50.133 --> 23:51.500
I pass.

23:52.633 --> 23:53.467
Me, too.

23:53.867 --> 23:55.133
I'm not touching that.

23:55.533 --> 23:58.000
I mean, I put on 12 pounds
just from dinner alone.

23:58.533 --> 23:59.633
Let's go for a walk.

23:59.700 --> 24:00.667
Right, burn it off.

24:00.734 --> 24:01.934
Are you kidding?

24:02.000 --> 24:04.367
After what we ate,
we'd have to walk to Canada.

24:04.433 --> 24:07.066
Oh, Mounties. I love Canadian men.

24:08.000 --> 24:11.000
(lively music playing)

24:14.000 --> 24:17.000
(closing theme music playing)
