WEBVTT

00:08.476 --> 00:09.743
<i>Oh, you see these?</i>

00:09.843 --> 00:12.012
The ones with
the long black spines?

00:12.113 --> 00:13.447
They're called <i>wana.</i>

00:13.547 --> 00:15.049
Those are the
dangerous ones, yeah?

00:15.149 --> 00:17.751
Yeah, only if you touch 'em.

00:17.851 --> 00:20.954
Here, the smaller purple ones
you can actually hold.

00:23.457 --> 00:25.659
Yeah, I'll pass.

00:27.861 --> 00:28.929
Okay.

00:29.029 --> 00:31.665
Actually, this one's
even cooler.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.469
If by "cool," you mean
gross and slimy...

00:35.569 --> 00:37.805
No, no, no, you don't even
have to touch it.

00:40.308 --> 00:41.575
Geez, Jasper!

00:41.675 --> 00:43.777
What the hell?
What...

00:43.877 --> 00:45.913
Come on! Come on!

00:46.013 --> 00:47.915
Hey.

00:48.015 --> 00:49.817
Admit it, I got you good.

00:49.917 --> 00:52.586
All you got was a place
on the couch for the night.

00:55.923 --> 00:57.125
Gabby.

00:57.225 --> 00:58.992
My throat.

01:00.261 --> 01:01.995
I can't...

01:02.096 --> 01:04.565
I am not falling for
another prank.

01:04.665 --> 01:07.000
I, I need he...

01:07.101 --> 01:08.269
Babe?

01:08.369 --> 01:10.671
Babe?! Babe?!

01:11.505 --> 01:12.473
Babe!

01:28.356 --> 01:30.023
You guys gonna say anything?

01:31.024 --> 01:31.959
Eventually.

01:32.059 --> 01:32.993
We're just taking it
all in.

01:33.093 --> 01:35.963
It's all really doable.

01:36.063 --> 01:37.097
I'll plan the big moves.

01:37.198 --> 01:38.399
But then with a Eurail Pass,

01:38.499 --> 01:40.134
I can sort of
play the rest by ear.

01:40.234 --> 01:41.502
Okay, but where are you gonna...

01:41.602 --> 01:42.836
There are hostels everywhere,

01:42.936 --> 01:44.972
so plenty of places
to stay.

01:45.072 --> 01:46.740
Great, but also...
And I'll be with people,

01:46.840 --> 01:48.476
you know, the whole time,
so it's safe.

01:48.576 --> 01:51.312
And if you're wondering
what I'll learn...

01:51.412 --> 01:53.581
Mom, you always say

01:53.681 --> 01:55.849
first-hand experience is
invaluable, right?

01:55.949 --> 01:57.851
What's more first-hand
than this?

02:02.256 --> 02:04.525
Well, clearly you put a lot of
thought into it.

02:04.625 --> 02:06.360
Cassandra helped. Yeah,

02:06.460 --> 02:08.462
it's got her fingerprints
all over it.

02:08.562 --> 02:10.198
What's that mean?

02:10.298 --> 02:13.133
It means we've never discussed
the idea of a gap year.

02:13.234 --> 02:15.569
'Cause it wasn't really
a thing when you were my age.

02:15.669 --> 02:18.206
But lot of colleges
encourage a trip like this.

02:18.306 --> 02:19.507
You haven't even

02:19.607 --> 02:21.074
gotten into college yet.
But when I do,

02:21.175 --> 02:23.043
I'll just be deferring
for a few months.

02:24.945 --> 02:26.747
Do you have any more questions?
I don't think so.

02:26.847 --> 02:27.748
I do.

02:27.848 --> 02:29.016
Who's paying for this?

02:29.116 --> 02:30.951
I am.
With what?

02:31.051 --> 02:32.019
My bank account.

02:32.119 --> 02:33.754
There it is, Jane.

02:33.854 --> 02:35.155
There it is.

02:35.256 --> 02:36.557
Okay, look, just hold on.

02:36.657 --> 02:38.326
What? What? It's my money, okay?

02:38.426 --> 02:39.727
Grandma and Grandpa
gave it to me.

02:39.827 --> 02:42.296
For college.
For education,

02:42.396 --> 02:44.097
and I'd learn so much
on this trip.

02:44.198 --> 02:46.434
My parents didn't save their
entire lives to give you a fund

02:46.534 --> 02:49.903
so you can blow it on some
road trip with your girlfriend.

02:50.003 --> 02:51.038
Daniel.

02:53.407 --> 02:54.675
Guys,

02:54.775 --> 02:56.377
we're gonna need to table this.

02:56.477 --> 02:58.646
That's convenient.

02:58.746 --> 03:00.248
That's my job.

03:00.348 --> 03:01.949
You know,
how she earns money?

03:02.049 --> 03:04.017
Guys, we're just
gonna take a breath,

03:04.117 --> 03:05.719
okay, everyone, and we'll...

03:07.455 --> 03:08.922
Yeah.

03:11.825 --> 03:14.262
<i>It's weird.</i>

03:14.362 --> 03:16.397
<i>I've never seen the beach
this empty before.</i>

03:16.497 --> 03:19.300
Never been the scene of a
sudden death of a Marine before.

03:19.400 --> 03:20.801
No official C.O.D. yet?

03:20.901 --> 03:23.203
Marine Corporal Jasper Kanahele

03:23.304 --> 03:24.772
stepped into a tidepool

03:24.872 --> 03:26.740
and 30 seconds later
had a massive seizure and died.

03:26.840 --> 03:29.877
Reason number 67 why I never
step foot in the water.

03:29.977 --> 03:31.279
Figured living with Whistler,

03:31.379 --> 03:32.880
she would've got you
on a surfboard by now.

03:32.980 --> 03:35.749
Our love is strong

03:35.849 --> 03:37.618
but not surfboard strong.

03:38.419 --> 03:40.821
You do know what happened here
is really unusual, right?

03:41.855 --> 03:44.124
The ocean didn't give him
a seizure.

03:44.224 --> 03:47.428
Uh, all I know for sure is

03:47.528 --> 03:50.864
feet, water, death, so...

03:52.099 --> 03:53.567
Yeah, well,

03:53.667 --> 03:55.569
I'm sure, uh, Commander Chase
can give us some context.

03:55.669 --> 03:57.738
Let me know
what she says.

03:57.838 --> 03:59.407
You're really not coming?

03:59.507 --> 04:00.974
Oh, I'm not, I'm really not.

04:01.074 --> 04:02.643
Mm-mm.

04:02.743 --> 04:04.545
Feet, water, death.

04:04.645 --> 04:06.113
Got it.

04:07.381 --> 04:09.550
Good morning, Kai. Hey.

04:09.650 --> 04:11.485
Assuming Lucy went
to get protective gear.

04:11.585 --> 04:13.287
Uh... No.

04:13.387 --> 04:14.622
Do we need it?

04:14.722 --> 04:16.890
Uh, only if you take
two more steps toward me.

04:16.990 --> 04:18.426
Otherwise, you should be okay.

04:18.526 --> 04:20.127
Right.

04:22.796 --> 04:24.865
So, uh, you know
what we're dealing with?

04:24.965 --> 04:26.900
You've heard of
a closed-room mystery?

04:27.000 --> 04:29.069
Yeah.
This is a closed-pool mystery.

04:29.903 --> 04:31.339
Can't figure out why he seized?

04:31.439 --> 04:34.542
Oh, no, Corporal Kanahele
died of a fentanyl overdose.

04:34.642 --> 04:36.209
Get that from
an instant tox screen?

04:36.310 --> 04:37.578
Got that from these.

04:37.678 --> 04:39.313
They were in
the tidepool with him.

04:39.413 --> 04:40.448
MCRT ran a test.

04:40.548 --> 04:42.883
100% pure fentanyl.

04:42.983 --> 04:44.685
And lots of it.
Okay, so the mystery

04:44.785 --> 04:46.820
is how the fentanyl
got in the pool.

04:46.920 --> 04:48.456
And at a high enough concentration

04:48.556 --> 04:50.324
to kill a fully grown man
in an instant.

04:50.424 --> 04:52.225
There's no chance that
the drugs were his?

04:52.326 --> 04:53.327
Victim's girlfriend insists

04:53.427 --> 04:54.362
he never did a drug
in his life.

04:54.462 --> 04:55.596
People lie.

04:55.696 --> 04:57.130
Science doesn't.

04:57.230 --> 04:59.032
I swabbed his nose and mouth.
Came up negative.

04:59.132 --> 05:00.868
Drugs likely entered
his bloodstream

05:00.968 --> 05:02.570
through abrasions on his feet.

05:03.371 --> 05:05.639
So we're chalking this up
as a tragic accident, then?

05:05.739 --> 05:07.408
I wouldn't be
so sure of that.

05:07.508 --> 05:10.043
MCRT just handed
me these.

05:10.143 --> 05:13.347
Six more bags of fentanyl
scattered across the beach.

05:21.622 --> 05:22.623
Is that for me?

05:22.723 --> 05:24.525
Yeah.
Thanks.

05:24.625 --> 05:25.793
But based on that face,

05:25.893 --> 05:27.395
I should've gone
with the extra bold.

05:27.495 --> 05:28.896
I asked the state to shut down

05:28.996 --> 05:30.531
all east-facing beaches
until we figure out

05:30.631 --> 05:32.733
where the fentanyl came from
and how far it spread.

05:32.833 --> 05:34.702
Oh, I'm sure they
took that well.

05:35.569 --> 05:37.004
19 calls and counting.

05:37.104 --> 05:39.006
Hawai'i tourist bureau,
hotel unions, surf clubs.

05:39.106 --> 05:40.708
I told them
all the same thing--

05:40.808 --> 05:42.275
better annoyed tourists
than dead ones.

05:42.376 --> 05:43.377
Yeah, that's the right call.

05:43.477 --> 05:45.312
I mean, this stuff is insidious.

05:45.413 --> 05:47.047
If the devil got into
the drug business,

05:47.147 --> 05:49.817
fentanyl would be
his product of choice.

05:49.917 --> 05:52.185
You speaking from
professional experience?

05:52.285 --> 05:54.187
Let's just say
fentanyl and I go way back.

05:54.287 --> 05:56.323
Okay, thank you.
We're now up to

05:56.424 --> 05:58.158
14 bags across three beaches.

05:58.258 --> 05:59.760
None extend past
the high tide line.

05:59.860 --> 06:01.429
So they washed to shore.

06:01.529 --> 06:02.963
Are we thinking
drug drop gone bad?

06:03.063 --> 06:05.065
Whatever happened,
we now have multiple beaches

06:05.165 --> 06:06.867
reporting a substance
easily dissolvable in water

06:06.967 --> 06:08.301
and deadly to the touch.

06:08.402 --> 06:10.337
And no idea
how much is still out there.

06:12.305 --> 06:14.007
Okay, get the geolocation data
to Ernie

06:14.107 --> 06:15.876
so he can try to triangulate.
On it, boss.

06:15.976 --> 06:17.511
Spread the word.

06:17.611 --> 06:18.712
Guys, no one travels

06:18.812 --> 06:19.947
without a drug rescue kit.

06:20.047 --> 06:21.782
Not until this case is over.

06:27.120 --> 06:29.623
Hey. What do we know about
fentanyl on the island?

06:29.723 --> 06:31.058
It's everywhere.

06:31.158 --> 06:33.160
Some of it stolen
from hospitals and pharmacies,

06:33.260 --> 06:34.728
most of it imported
from outside sources.

06:34.828 --> 06:36.029
What about the bags we found?

06:36.129 --> 06:38.799
Based on chemical analysis,
it's 100% pure.

06:38.899 --> 06:40.734
And it's been
flooding the island for months.

06:40.834 --> 06:42.803
Any idea who's bringing it in?

06:42.903 --> 06:44.171
FBI and DEA believe

06:44.271 --> 06:46.073
it's the Caldero cartel
out of Colombia.

06:46.173 --> 06:51.044
Why would a Colombian cartel
run drugs through Hawai'i?

06:51.144 --> 06:53.013
Either as a distribution hub,
ferrying narcotics from

06:53.113 --> 06:54.682
China, where they're made,
to the mainland,

06:54.782 --> 06:57.184
or they're
manufacturing them here.

06:58.018 --> 06:59.386
In the islands?

07:00.387 --> 07:01.388
It's hard to tell.

07:01.489 --> 07:02.656
It's the first real evidence

07:02.756 --> 07:04.257
the Calderos are
operating here at all.

07:04.357 --> 07:07.060
Well, hopefully it'll get us
closer to shutting them down.

07:07.160 --> 07:10.230
Just need to find how those
drugs washed up on the beach.

07:11.064 --> 07:12.966
But that's insanity!

07:13.066 --> 07:14.668
You hear yourself, right?

07:14.768 --> 07:17.037
You're saying I need to spend
60,000 just to fix it up,

07:17.137 --> 07:18.972
and then still lose 20
when I sell?

07:19.072 --> 07:20.574
That's not how math works.

07:20.674 --> 07:22.209
By your logic, I should just

07:22.309 --> 07:24.478
burn it down
and take the insurance.

07:25.378 --> 07:28.348
I'm kidding,
I'm totally kidding.

07:28.448 --> 07:29.783
I'll get back to you.

07:30.951 --> 07:31.985
You selling your place?

07:32.085 --> 07:33.587
No, my father's place.

07:33.687 --> 07:35.889
Your father?

07:37.324 --> 07:38.826
It's a long story.

07:39.627 --> 07:41.394
So tell me.

07:43.130 --> 07:45.198
My father passed
the other month.

07:46.567 --> 07:49.069
Left me some property
I need to get rid of.

07:49.169 --> 07:51.471
Oh, guess it's not a long story.

07:52.573 --> 07:54.441
God, Ernie, I'm so sorry.

07:54.542 --> 07:55.776
Real estate's a fickle game.

07:55.876 --> 07:57.110
No, I'm sorry
about your dad.

07:57.210 --> 07:58.946
There's nothing
to be sorry about.

08:00.113 --> 08:02.415
He died... the other month.

08:02.516 --> 08:03.884
You didn't say anything.

08:03.984 --> 08:08.188
There's nothing
worth saying, so...

08:08.288 --> 08:11.424
Anyway, I inputted
the geolocation data

08:11.525 --> 08:12.726
where our drugs were found.

08:15.729 --> 08:17.264
Based on current patterns

08:17.364 --> 08:19.366
and a little help from
an algorithm I wrote,

08:19.466 --> 08:21.602
I'm 98.6% sure the fentanyl

08:21.702 --> 08:24.738
was dumped about a quarter mile
off the Kailua coast.

08:24.838 --> 08:27.074
98.6% sure?

08:27.174 --> 08:28.642
I'm actually 100% sure.

08:28.742 --> 08:30.243
I just wanted to appear modest.

08:30.343 --> 08:31.378
Ooh, it worked.

08:31.478 --> 08:32.880
You appeared 1.4% modest.

08:32.980 --> 08:35.415
Why would somebody
dump drugs out at sea?

08:35.515 --> 08:38.085
Only one way to find out.

08:45.092 --> 08:47.394
Whoo!

08:48.161 --> 08:50.731
Sometimes I pinch myself
they pay us to do this.

08:50.831 --> 08:52.700
Yeah. Makes up for every
late-night stakeout,

08:52.800 --> 08:54.067
that's for sure.

08:54.167 --> 08:56.203
Can't remember the last time
I was out this far.

08:56.303 --> 08:58.005
I just want to jump in,
you know?

08:58.105 --> 08:59.907
Yeah, you're the waterman.

09:00.007 --> 09:02.275
I'm more of a boatman,
but I hear ya.

09:05.012 --> 09:06.714
We're getting close
to the spot.

09:06.814 --> 09:08.448
I'll get Wilbur.

09:09.983 --> 09:12.552
He's the tall diver
with the good hair, right?

09:12.653 --> 09:13.921
I always forget his name.

09:14.021 --> 09:15.455
No, that's Carl.

09:15.555 --> 09:16.857
Shame on you.

09:16.957 --> 09:18.458
He got you cupcakes for
your birthday.

09:18.558 --> 09:19.893
Yeah.

09:20.728 --> 09:23.296
This is Wilbur.

09:23.396 --> 09:24.932
As in an acronym
for something?

09:25.032 --> 09:27.067
As in Orville's brother.

09:28.535 --> 09:30.904
Ah-ha-ha,
the Wright Brothers,

09:31.004 --> 09:32.239
'cause it's a drone.

09:32.339 --> 09:34.808
Uh, well, Wilbur
isn't just a drone.

09:34.908 --> 09:36.376
I modified him with

09:36.476 --> 09:38.278
an underwater
laser-scanning camera.

09:38.378 --> 09:41.682
If there's something
down there, we'll find it.

09:41.782 --> 09:43.751
Like a sunken crate
filled with drugs?

09:43.851 --> 09:45.018
Who knows?

09:45.819 --> 09:49.089
It's not every day I get to
spend time with my little buddy.

09:50.824 --> 09:52.993
That's cool, Ern.
I like you, too.

09:53.093 --> 09:55.328
No, I meant Wilbur.

09:57.665 --> 09:58.899
Oh.

10:00.934 --> 10:03.270
There's a whole lot
of nothing down there.

10:03.370 --> 10:04.437
Yeah.

10:04.537 --> 10:05.839
No active reef, no fish.

10:05.939 --> 10:06.907
Mostly sand and...

10:07.007 --> 10:08.308
What's that?

10:08.408 --> 10:09.877
Uh, it's hard to say,
given the depth,

10:09.977 --> 10:11.344
but it doesn't look natural.

10:13.647 --> 10:15.649
Need to get down there and see.

10:15.749 --> 10:17.484
Could be a sunken ship.

10:17.584 --> 10:18.986
Some sort of debris.

10:19.086 --> 10:22.255
Yeah, all sorts of weird stuff
ends up in the ocean.

10:23.891 --> 10:27.294
Uh, let's just let the
professionals check it out.

10:27.394 --> 10:30.898
I'll just ask Carl and his team
to suit up and take a...

10:32.499 --> 10:33.767
...look.

11:20.881 --> 11:22.783
It's like he's staring
right at me.

11:22.883 --> 11:25.385
I mean, if he still had
his eyes.

11:25.485 --> 11:26.419
Kind of unsettling, right?

11:26.519 --> 11:27.955
Definitely unsettling.

11:28.055 --> 11:29.689
This one really
gets my juices going, too.

11:29.790 --> 11:31.992
The crabs and fish
had already gone to work

11:32.092 --> 11:34.361
on the corpse, not to mention
all the water decay.

11:34.461 --> 11:35.763
Judging by decomp,

11:35.863 --> 11:37.464
he was down there
about 45 days.

11:37.564 --> 11:38.665
That's pretty nasty.

11:38.766 --> 11:40.333
Were you able
to get an I.D.?

11:40.433 --> 11:41.701
Dental records match

11:41.802 --> 11:43.871
a Mililani resident
named Stanley Chao.

11:43.971 --> 11:45.739
I'm assuming the crash
killed him.

11:45.839 --> 11:47.875
Other way around, actually.
A myocardial infarction

11:47.975 --> 11:49.609
caused him to lose control
of the aircraft.

11:49.709 --> 11:51.044
How could you tell?

11:51.845 --> 11:54.547
Labs showed extremely elevated
cardiac troponin levels

11:54.647 --> 11:57.650
consistent with somebody
who had a recent M.I.

11:58.485 --> 11:59.686
I only got one question.

11:59.787 --> 12:01.654
If the pilot's been dead
for six weeks,

12:01.755 --> 12:03.991
why are the drugs
just coming ashore now?

12:07.560 --> 12:09.529
Okay, Jesse. Great.

12:09.629 --> 12:10.931
Listen, we gotta
check with forensics

12:11.031 --> 12:13.466
to see if the plane holds
any answers.

12:13.566 --> 12:15.102
All right, I'll be in soon.

12:15.202 --> 12:16.536
Bye.

12:19.106 --> 12:20.841
What's up?

12:21.909 --> 12:23.376
You were out late
last night.

12:23.476 --> 12:25.645
I was studying at Cass's place.

12:25.745 --> 12:26.980
And hiding in your bedroom,
hoping I'd leave

12:27.080 --> 12:28.381
before you came out
for breakfast?

12:28.481 --> 12:29.516
I wasn't hiding.

12:29.616 --> 12:32.319
Avoiding, evading, dodging.

12:32.419 --> 12:35.588
This. I was avoiding,
evading, dodging this.

12:35.688 --> 12:37.457
Alex, we need to talk about it.

12:37.557 --> 12:39.559
So you can tell me
no to Europe, too?
No.

12:39.659 --> 12:41.661
Is it 'cause
you don't like Cass?

12:41.761 --> 12:43.763
You don't want me to
be around her?

12:43.864 --> 12:45.532
No, we like Cass just fine.

12:45.632 --> 12:47.567
You dropped a bomb on us yesterday.

12:47.667 --> 12:48.869
Out of nowhere.

12:48.969 --> 12:50.871
It wasn't out of nowhere.

12:50.971 --> 12:52.539
I've been thinking
about it for weeks.

12:52.639 --> 12:54.107
Really put the work in.

12:54.207 --> 12:56.276
I thought you'd be proud of me
for taking initiative.

12:56.376 --> 12:59.079
I am. Okay, really, I am.

12:59.179 --> 13:00.948
But it was just last month
that you were

13:01.048 --> 13:02.850
finally cleared
to play baseball again.

13:02.950 --> 13:04.885
I thought we had a plan.

13:06.286 --> 13:07.687
You guys had a plan.

13:08.856 --> 13:11.959
I... I didn't know
what I wanted.

13:12.059 --> 13:14.127
But then this trip
came along,

13:14.227 --> 13:17.697
and I felt excited for the
first time since my injury.

13:19.066 --> 13:21.068
Okay.

13:21.168 --> 13:24.237
I hear you.
And I respect it.

13:24.337 --> 13:25.505
So...

13:25.605 --> 13:27.140
can I go?

13:27.240 --> 13:28.308
You're 18.

13:29.309 --> 13:30.677
Can't stop you.

13:30.777 --> 13:33.180
But you can manipulate me
into doing it your way,

13:33.280 --> 13:34.481
like you always do.

13:34.581 --> 13:36.416
Okay, I like to see it more as

13:36.516 --> 13:38.685
illuminating the righteous path.

13:39.987 --> 13:40.921
Mom.

13:41.021 --> 13:43.290
Look,

13:43.390 --> 13:45.158
if you want to take a gap year

13:45.258 --> 13:46.894
and go to Europe...

13:46.994 --> 13:49.196
your father and I
aren't gonna stop you.

13:50.297 --> 13:51.498
Really?

13:51.598 --> 13:53.366
We're not gonna
help you, either.

13:54.067 --> 13:55.335
But...
Just like we said,

13:55.435 --> 13:57.637
that money is for college
and college only.

13:57.737 --> 14:00.273
So, if you want to go,

14:00.373 --> 14:03.710
you gotta figure out
a way to pay for it yourself.

14:07.447 --> 14:09.749
Okay.
Okay.

14:09.849 --> 14:11.952
I will.

14:16.289 --> 14:18.892
You're telling me he didn't
mention it at all?

14:18.992 --> 14:21.494
No, I think I'd remember
if he told me his dad died.

14:21.594 --> 14:23.063
Two months ago.

14:23.163 --> 14:24.697
In South Carolina.
I looked it up.

14:26.766 --> 14:29.002
Look, if he didn't
want to talk about it...

14:29.102 --> 14:31.138
I know, it's weird.
He didn't tell any of us.

14:31.238 --> 14:33.673
I was gonna say, if he
didn't want to talk about it,

14:33.773 --> 14:34.975
then maybe
we should respect that.

14:35.075 --> 14:37.077
Which is why I'm talking
to you about it.

14:37.177 --> 14:39.846
Can I help you with something?

14:39.947 --> 14:41.348
Hey, Bam Bam.

14:41.448 --> 14:42.749
It's me.

14:42.849 --> 14:44.451
Special Agent Holman,
this is...

14:44.551 --> 14:45.785
Special Agent Tara.

14:45.885 --> 14:47.254
I know who you are.

14:47.354 --> 14:48.721
Why are you here?

14:49.589 --> 14:51.091
Oh, uh, for the plane.

14:52.859 --> 14:54.928
That we fished out
of the water.

14:55.028 --> 14:56.429
With a dead guy in it.

14:56.529 --> 14:57.730
Sure.

14:57.830 --> 14:59.366
Here it is.

15:00.167 --> 15:03.036
Yeah, we see that.
Um, any insight?

15:03.136 --> 15:04.972
It was definitely the source of

15:05.072 --> 15:06.839
the fentanyl
that drifted to shore.

15:06.940 --> 15:09.476
Aside from the intact baggies
that we found inside,

15:09.576 --> 15:12.345
there are traces of the drug
all over the cabin.

15:12.445 --> 15:15.548
So the drugs just
floated out after impact?

15:15.648 --> 15:17.150
Actually, no.

15:17.250 --> 15:18.785
The plane was secure
when it crashed.

15:18.885 --> 15:20.753
Someone liberated the drugs
after the fact.

15:23.690 --> 15:26.659
These burn marks are made from
a mixture of strontium nitrate

15:26.759 --> 15:28.028
and potassium perchlorate.

15:28.128 --> 15:30.964
Mixed together,
they make underwater flares.

15:31.064 --> 15:32.499
Used by divers at night.
Mm-hmm.

15:32.599 --> 15:34.434
So someone went down there
to retrieve the drugs.

15:34.534 --> 15:36.203
Yep, and during
the salvage operation,

15:36.303 --> 15:38.871
some of the packets got free
and drifted to shore.

15:38.972 --> 15:41.274
Any idea how much
fentanyl was on board?

15:41.374 --> 15:43.910
Mm, best estimate,
several crates.

15:44.011 --> 15:46.279
Could be 100 kilos.

15:46.379 --> 15:49.582
This cargo strap was cut with
a serrated dive knife.

15:49.682 --> 15:52.219
I found five other pieces
that were sliced the same way.

15:52.319 --> 15:54.887
Are we thinking the dealers
came for their own stash?

15:54.988 --> 15:56.889
Why would they wait so long?

15:56.990 --> 15:59.159
'Cause they wouldn't have
known where to look.

15:59.259 --> 16:01.094
Your pilot turned off
his transponder.

16:01.194 --> 16:03.530
No one would have known
where he went down.

16:03.630 --> 16:05.965
That explains why the crash
wasn't picked up on radar.

16:06.066 --> 16:09.202
Yeah, but then how
did anyone find it at all?

16:13.640 --> 16:15.875
Okay. What do we know
about our dead pilot?

16:15.975 --> 16:17.977
Stanley Chao lived alone.

16:18.078 --> 16:19.712
No family. He was running
a nearly bankrupt

16:19.812 --> 16:21.781
one-man tour
and cargo operation.

16:21.881 --> 16:26.919
Yet we found 70 grand
in cash at his apartment.

16:27.020 --> 16:28.555
So, running drugs to
stay afloat.

16:28.655 --> 16:30.357
Sure.
And the drug dealers

16:30.457 --> 16:32.159
who hired him would have
known his rough route.

16:32.259 --> 16:34.294
Maybe it just took 'em a while
to find the plane.

16:34.394 --> 16:36.129
The Caldero Cartel is moving

16:36.229 --> 16:37.997
a bunch of this stuff
through Hawai'i every month.

16:38.098 --> 16:41.768
A kilo is worth
maybe four grand wholesale.

16:41.868 --> 16:43.870
Why risk exposure
retrieving any of it?

16:43.970 --> 16:44.971
They wouldn't.

16:45.072 --> 16:46.406
Just write it off.

16:47.374 --> 16:50.077
If not the cartel,
then who?

16:51.478 --> 16:53.012
So, someone...

16:53.113 --> 16:54.781
found that plane,

16:54.881 --> 16:57.016
pulled off a sophisticated
salvage operation

16:57.117 --> 16:59.252
50 feet beneath the sea
in the middle of the night.

16:59.352 --> 17:02.355
Now, that... that takes
experienced divers.

17:02.455 --> 17:05.325
Can't be that many divers
with this particular skill set

17:05.425 --> 17:06.793
on the island.

17:06.893 --> 17:08.328
This is Hawai'i.

17:08.428 --> 17:10.363
The best watermen
in the world live here.

17:10.463 --> 17:11.864
But experienced divers

17:11.964 --> 17:14.201
looking to unload
a dangerous product,

17:14.301 --> 17:16.303
that is not all that common.

17:16.403 --> 17:19.639
Look, whoever took the drugs
will be trying to sell them.

17:19.739 --> 17:21.441
Let's start there.

17:21.541 --> 17:23.076
Right.

17:31.818 --> 17:33.653
Every one of these places
is the same.

17:33.753 --> 17:36.022
Same old-timey dive suit,

17:36.123 --> 17:38.891
same big trophy fish
on the walls.

17:38.991 --> 17:41.694
Same nasty glares as we walk in.

17:41.794 --> 17:43.930
Don't judge, Luce,
that might be awed reverence

17:44.030 --> 17:45.598
for our public service.

17:45.698 --> 17:48.801
Hey there.
How you doing?

17:48.901 --> 17:50.637
Got a few questions.

17:50.737 --> 17:52.139
Mm-mm.

17:53.440 --> 17:54.907
We don't talk to cops. Whew.

17:55.007 --> 17:56.476
Ooh, that's awe, all right.

17:56.576 --> 17:58.111
Maybe, uh, I don't know,

17:58.211 --> 18:00.513
let me handle this?

18:00.613 --> 18:02.282
Need a little charm
in your approach.

18:04.016 --> 18:05.017
Aloha!

18:05.118 --> 18:06.819
Do y'all mind if we talk?

18:06.919 --> 18:08.988
Wow, that was amazing.

18:09.088 --> 18:11.023
You should teach that at FLETC.
Shut up.

18:12.659 --> 18:13.593
You drinking?

18:13.693 --> 18:15.595
Oh, I mean, wish we could,

18:15.695 --> 18:16.963
but we're on duty.

18:17.063 --> 18:18.665
No drinking, no talking.

18:18.765 --> 18:20.567
That's the rules.

18:21.534 --> 18:22.969
You kidding?

18:23.069 --> 18:25.004
Hey. Hey!

18:25.104 --> 18:27.207
Hey, buddy, get back here.

18:27.307 --> 18:29.209
And answer some questions

18:29.309 --> 18:30.910
or risk having
this whole place shut down.

18:31.010 --> 18:32.212
Police tried
to shut this place down

18:32.312 --> 18:34.514
three times over the last year.

18:34.614 --> 18:36.048
Noise complaints, fighting.

18:36.149 --> 18:38.551
How about distribution of
Schedule II narcotics?

18:38.651 --> 18:40.753
No, that's new.

18:40.853 --> 18:42.922
It's also against the rules.

18:43.022 --> 18:44.924
Look, I get it.
You don't like cops,

18:45.024 --> 18:46.726
we don't like
surly bartenders,

18:46.826 --> 18:48.127
so same, same.

18:48.228 --> 18:50.129
But some divers stumbled upon

18:50.230 --> 18:52.299
several crates of
high-grade uncut fentanyl.

18:52.399 --> 18:54.000
And we already have one death

18:54.100 --> 18:55.368
from accidental overdose,

18:55.468 --> 18:57.337
so the longer
this crap is out there...

18:58.137 --> 19:00.139
I can't help you.

19:00.240 --> 19:01.608
What-- No, no, no, no, no.

19:01.708 --> 19:03.109
No, you just thought of
something right then.

19:03.210 --> 19:05.445
You're deciding not to help.

19:08.248 --> 19:09.682
I don't want to get involved.

19:09.782 --> 19:13.853
What you don't want
are those drugs out there.

19:13.953 --> 19:15.555
I promise you.

19:17.957 --> 19:19.492
Ring the bell,

19:19.592 --> 19:20.927
and maybe I'll help.

19:21.027 --> 19:22.995
This bell right here?

19:25.765 --> 19:27.734
Sure.
Jess...

19:31.137 --> 19:32.339
What's going on?
What's happening?

19:32.439 --> 19:35.308
Read the rules, Jess.

19:35.408 --> 19:37.310
Every ring of the bell
is a round on you.

19:37.410 --> 19:38.778
You just bought three.

19:38.878 --> 19:40.480
Geez.

19:40.580 --> 19:42.882
Dude was in here
a couple days ago.

19:42.982 --> 19:43.983
Trying to move serious weight.

19:44.083 --> 19:46.286
I tossed him out.

19:48.054 --> 19:49.322
Cash or credit?

19:51.724 --> 19:53.593
♪ Wanna help me, I ♪

19:53.693 --> 19:57.129
♪ Live every day,
I know I'm running hard. ♪

20:02.969 --> 20:04.170
This is the place.

20:04.271 --> 20:05.438
Put the respirator on.

20:05.538 --> 20:07.507
No, they always
fog up on me.

20:07.607 --> 20:09.276
This stuff is volatile,
all right?

20:09.376 --> 20:10.977
I'm gonna have to
pull rank here.

20:11.077 --> 20:12.479
You outrank me?

20:12.579 --> 20:14.581
Obviously.
Put the respirator on.

20:26.826 --> 20:29.061
Cameron?

20:30.196 --> 20:32.098
You here?

20:34.734 --> 20:35.935
Seems empty.

20:36.836 --> 20:39.539
Except all the lights are on
and the door was open.

20:39.639 --> 20:41.240
Back there.

20:47.480 --> 20:49.081
Careful.

20:51.818 --> 20:54.287
Federal agents. Don't move.

21:01.794 --> 21:03.530
He's not moving anywhere.

21:14.040 --> 21:16.175
What's the verdict,
Commander?

21:16.275 --> 21:18.077
Well, we're supposed to
think the victim died

21:18.177 --> 21:19.612
of an accidental overdose.

21:19.712 --> 21:22.382
But that's not
what this is.

21:22.482 --> 21:23.783
See that?

21:23.883 --> 21:25.652
Yeah, looks like ligature
marks on his wrists.

21:25.752 --> 21:26.919
Bruising on
the arms, too.

21:27.019 --> 21:28.421
Someone tied him down,

21:28.521 --> 21:30.022
shot him full of enough drugs
to stop his heart.

21:30.122 --> 21:32.525
Then removed his bindings
and slipped away.

21:32.625 --> 21:36.363
No sign of the stolen
fentanyl anywhere here.

21:36.463 --> 21:39.065
The cartel tracked Cameron down
before we could.

21:39.165 --> 21:41.000
Killed him
and took their drugs back.

21:41.100 --> 21:42.602
Maybe.

21:42.702 --> 21:43.636
You got another theory?

21:43.736 --> 21:45.705
This was likely cartel,

21:45.805 --> 21:47.774
but what if the drugs
weren't here?

21:47.874 --> 21:49.842
What if someone
else has them?

21:49.942 --> 21:52.178
And who would that be?

21:52.278 --> 21:53.680
Cameron's partners.

21:55.314 --> 21:57.316
<i>Amanda Lee and Tyler Malone...</i>

21:57.417 --> 21:59.586
Cameron's partners in
Journey Hawai'i Tours.

21:59.686 --> 22:01.788
They started the company
three years ago.

22:01.888 --> 22:04.190
They take tourists on
extreme adventures.

22:04.290 --> 22:06.225
You think Amanda and Tyler
have the stolen fentanyl?

22:06.325 --> 22:07.960
Accessing the downed
plane at night was

22:08.060 --> 22:09.529
at least a two-person job,

22:09.629 --> 22:11.197
so Cameron couldn't
have done it alone.

22:11.297 --> 22:13.566
And since they're
not in custody...

22:13.666 --> 22:15.502
I'm assuming
they're in the wind?

22:15.602 --> 22:16.869
Well, their socials went dark

22:16.969 --> 22:18.337
around the time
Cameron was killed.

22:18.438 --> 22:19.639
Residences are empty,

22:19.739 --> 22:21.941
cars still parked
in the marina.

22:22.041 --> 22:23.643
And their tour boat is missing.

22:23.743 --> 22:25.144
Transponder?

22:25.244 --> 22:26.312
Nah, turned off.

22:26.413 --> 22:29.015
Cell phones?
Left in their cars.

22:29.115 --> 22:30.450
Okay.

22:30.550 --> 22:33.686
Uh, let's assume they know
the cartel is after them.

22:33.786 --> 22:34.921
Lucy, can you contact

22:35.021 --> 22:36.389
the harbormasters
on all the islands

22:36.489 --> 22:38.290
and reach out
to the Coast Guard, too?
Mm-hmm.

22:38.391 --> 22:40.593
They might be rookie criminals,
but they're expert sailors.

22:40.693 --> 22:41.928
If they don't want to be found,

22:42.028 --> 22:44.030
they probably won't be. Mm.

22:44.130 --> 22:45.965
Maybe, but the channel
between the islands

22:46.065 --> 22:49.402
can be treacherous
even for experienced sailors.

22:52.004 --> 22:55.908
Yep. So, I dug into Journey
Hawai'i Tours' purchase orders.

22:56.008 --> 22:57.944
They bought a handheld
GPS device last year.

22:58.044 --> 23:00.880
You able to trace it?
Uh-huh.

23:00.980 --> 23:02.949
At 6:22 this morning,
their device pinged

23:03.049 --> 23:04.917
on a remote beach on Kauai.

23:05.017 --> 23:07.253
Jesse, Kai, go find them.

23:10.022 --> 23:12.725
Hey, Ernie.

23:12.825 --> 23:14.561
Don't do that.

23:14.661 --> 23:16.262
Don't do say hello?

23:16.362 --> 23:18.164
Don't say it with

23:18.264 --> 23:20.332
all that "I'm sorry your
father died" energy.

23:20.433 --> 23:21.868
But I am sorry.

23:21.968 --> 23:23.770
And I know it,
and thank you.

23:23.870 --> 23:25.805
I'm fine.

23:25.905 --> 23:27.740
Let's track the cartel.

23:27.840 --> 23:30.610
I, uh... I respect
your feelings.

23:30.710 --> 23:32.011
You don't want to
talk about your dad.

23:32.111 --> 23:33.145
I'm not gonna make you. Great.

23:33.245 --> 23:36.282
But if you did
want to talk,

23:36.382 --> 23:37.950
know that I'm here.

23:38.050 --> 23:41.187
To talk, if you want,
which I know you don't.

23:43.456 --> 23:44.691
You done?

23:44.791 --> 23:45.958
I think so.

23:46.058 --> 23:48.027
Let me show you what I found.

23:48.127 --> 23:51.764
The Caldero cartel has covered
their tracks completely.

23:51.864 --> 23:53.600
The only sign of them
is their product.

23:53.700 --> 23:55.768
So, I have been looking into

23:55.868 --> 23:57.504
our dead pilot's
movements instead.

23:57.604 --> 23:59.371
And?
Chao played it smart.

23:59.472 --> 24:01.340
No digital connection
to the cartel,

24:01.440 --> 24:03.643
no communications,
no bank deposits.

24:03.743 --> 24:04.944
So we're at zero?

24:05.044 --> 24:06.746
More like 30,000 feet.

24:06.846 --> 24:08.180
I-I don't care how
careful someone is.

24:08.280 --> 24:09.816
There are pieces of data
you can't hide.

24:09.916 --> 24:11.551
For instance,
flight manifests

24:11.651 --> 24:13.019
filed with the FAA.

24:13.119 --> 24:14.821
Chao's Cessna
takes off and lands

24:14.921 --> 24:16.689
at a variety of airports
around Hawai'i.

24:16.789 --> 24:18.457
Makes sense
for somebody running

24:18.558 --> 24:19.959
a tour and cargo operation.

24:20.059 --> 24:23.095
Except these three trips
in the last few months,

24:23.195 --> 24:25.097
he takes off and lands
at the same airfield.

24:25.197 --> 24:28.167
Maybe he took tourists
on a day trip?
Mm-mm.

24:28.267 --> 24:30.269
There were no other passengers
listed on the manifests.

24:30.369 --> 24:32.404
And he was gone for
at least eight hours.

24:32.505 --> 24:33.806
I'm not following.

24:33.906 --> 24:36.108
Cessna has a
six-hour range.

24:36.208 --> 24:39.579
So Chao landed
somewhere secretly?

24:39.679 --> 24:41.447
Find out where,
and money to malasadas,

24:41.548 --> 24:44.651
you'll find your cartel hub
for all these drugs.

24:44.751 --> 24:46.385
Yep.

24:46.485 --> 24:49.989
These guys are really
trying to get lost out here.

24:50.089 --> 24:52.659
Figure they realized
how big a mistake

24:52.759 --> 24:54.226
they made stealing
those drugs?

24:54.326 --> 24:56.696
Figure I don't care.
I got zero sympathy for them.

24:56.796 --> 24:58.197
That's a little harsh.

24:58.297 --> 25:00.533
Look, every packet
of fentanyl they stole

25:00.633 --> 25:02.101
might as well
be a loaded gun.

25:02.201 --> 25:04.671
Yeah, it's a
dangerous narcotic.

25:04.771 --> 25:06.472
Not just dangerous.

25:06.573 --> 25:08.374
Lethal.

25:08.474 --> 25:11.277
I feel like you got
a story to tell.

25:13.079 --> 25:15.582
Not my story.

25:15.682 --> 25:17.684
Hitchcock and Gomez.

25:17.784 --> 25:22.989
Worked night patrols at the
Second District back in D.C.

25:23.089 --> 25:27.093
Hitch had 20 years in,
five kids.

25:27.193 --> 25:29.596
Gomez was putting
himself through

25:29.696 --> 25:31.363
law school on the weekends.

25:31.463 --> 25:34.400
And one night,
they got a call.

25:34.500 --> 25:37.469
Two students, Georgetown,
OD'd in their dorm.

25:38.971 --> 25:42.174
I'm detective on deck.

25:42.274 --> 25:44.644
Show up to the scene,
what do I find?

25:44.744 --> 25:47.379
Two dead bodies.

25:47.479 --> 25:49.281
No, four.

25:49.381 --> 25:52.018
You know, Hitch and Gomez
found the kids on the floor.

25:52.118 --> 25:53.986
What does their training
tell them?

25:54.086 --> 25:57.056
Try lifesaving measures. Yeah.

25:57.156 --> 25:59.191
Gave the kids mouth-to-mouth...

25:59.291 --> 26:01.127
and like that,
stopped breathing.

26:01.227 --> 26:05.131
Just from the residue
on their lips.

26:07.066 --> 26:09.636
Spent the morning
informing two kids' parents,

26:09.736 --> 26:12.805
Gomez's wife and...

26:12.905 --> 26:15.174
Hitch's whole family.

26:18.778 --> 26:20.279
Man, I'm sorry. I...

26:20.379 --> 26:24.617
Like I say...
not my story.

26:24.717 --> 26:27.286
I'm just the only one left
to tell it.

26:29.521 --> 26:31.624
Hey, if you
need a moment...
Hey, you smell that?

26:31.724 --> 26:33.359
Smoke.

26:33.459 --> 26:34.994
Yeah.

26:42.534 --> 26:44.503
Damn, it's been going a while.

26:44.603 --> 26:46.238
Hey, you think Amanda
and Tyler were here?

26:46.338 --> 26:47.707
Oh, my God!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

26:47.807 --> 26:49.108
Hey!
Tyler-- please help him!

26:49.208 --> 26:50.977
Hey, you can't go in there!
Tyler! But Tyler!

26:51.077 --> 26:52.611
Amanda, Amanda,
if he was in there,

26:52.712 --> 26:53.880
there's no
helping him now.

26:53.980 --> 26:56.482
I'm sorry.

27:04.891 --> 27:06.125
<i>This can't be happening.</i>

27:06.225 --> 27:08.728
I went for a hike,
and Tyler was just fine.

27:08.828 --> 27:10.562
Why were you here on Kauai?

27:10.663 --> 27:12.765
I wanted to get away
for a few days.

27:12.865 --> 27:15.201
And the crates
of fentanyl you stole?

27:17.203 --> 27:19.538
How does that play
in your getaway?

27:19.638 --> 27:21.173
I don't know what
you're talking about.

27:21.273 --> 27:24.143
You know exactly what I'm
talking about, Amanda.

27:24.243 --> 27:25.544
Tell the truth.

27:25.644 --> 27:27.246
Why are you acting like this?

27:27.346 --> 27:29.081
My friend just died in a fire.

27:29.181 --> 27:30.649
No, he didn't.

27:31.483 --> 27:33.619
There was no one inside.

27:34.553 --> 27:35.688
No sign of the drugs.

27:35.788 --> 27:38.024
Oh, thank God.

27:38.124 --> 27:39.591
Tyler's okay.

27:39.692 --> 27:41.660
Probably not.

27:41.761 --> 27:42.895
What do you mean?

27:42.995 --> 27:44.330
The fire wasn't
an accident.

27:44.430 --> 27:46.298
Someone poured gasoline
all over the cabin.

27:46.398 --> 27:48.801
Who would do that?
The same people who killed

27:48.901 --> 27:50.636
your other partner, Cameron.

27:52.038 --> 27:54.140
Which you clearly know about.
Which is why you and Tyler

27:54.240 --> 27:57.576
were hiding in this cabin
with the fentanyl you stole.

28:00.747 --> 28:03.249
Hey, Amanda.

28:04.050 --> 28:07.353
Listen to me-- those drugs
belong to the Caldero cartel.

28:07.453 --> 28:08.788
They clearly want them back.

28:08.888 --> 28:11.824
Two people are
dead already.
Two?

28:11.924 --> 28:13.625
Yeah, a Marine died

28:13.726 --> 28:15.728
from your drugs
contaminating a tidepool.

28:19.165 --> 28:20.967
I feel sick to my stomach. Good.

28:21.067 --> 28:23.770
Now you know how deep
you're in it.

28:23.870 --> 28:26.739
So talk to us, Amanda.

28:30.609 --> 28:32.879
Look, I told Ty and Cam

28:32.979 --> 28:35.782
I wanted nothing
to do with any of this.

28:35.882 --> 28:39.051
It was so stupid,
taking those crates.

28:39.151 --> 28:40.652
But you helped?

28:40.753 --> 28:43.689
I'm the one
who found the plane.

28:43.790 --> 28:45.825
Tracking tiger sharks.

28:46.859 --> 28:48.928
I wanted to call
the Coast Guard.

28:49.028 --> 28:50.997
Ty and Cam wanted a closer look.

28:51.097 --> 28:53.933
And when they
found those drugs?

28:55.367 --> 28:57.636
They saw an opportunity.

28:57.736 --> 29:00.606
To pay off our boat,
the equipment.

29:00.706 --> 29:04.844
I-I begged them
to just walk away.

29:06.545 --> 29:08.781
They wouldn't listen.

29:11.918 --> 29:16.355
What-what happens if that
cartel has Tyler now?

29:22.661 --> 29:24.596
If the Caldero cartel
got their drugs back,

29:24.696 --> 29:26.332
Tyler's probably dead.

29:26.432 --> 29:29.335
Got endless FBI and DEA
reports of informants

29:29.435 --> 29:32.571
and enemies they've killed
over the years-- none pleasant.

29:32.671 --> 29:33.973
My gut says he's
still alive.

29:34.073 --> 29:35.474
Why would they
keep him alive?

29:35.574 --> 29:37.509
To get information,
figure out who else he told.

29:37.609 --> 29:38.911
See if anything
could lead back

29:39.011 --> 29:40.279
to their operation
in Hawai'i.

29:40.379 --> 29:41.647
It's hard to believe Tyler

29:41.747 --> 29:42.849
knows anything
about their operation,

29:42.949 --> 29:44.616
considering we
can't track it.

29:44.716 --> 29:46.052
There is no can't,
Kate Whistler.

29:46.152 --> 29:48.520
There is only when.
What does that mean?

29:48.620 --> 29:49.688
It means we
have the answer.

29:49.788 --> 29:51.057
Actually, I have
the answer.

29:51.157 --> 29:52.391
Ernie's just here
for the ride.

29:52.491 --> 29:53.759
I mean, it was
a team effort.

29:53.860 --> 29:55.194
I spent all morning
trying to find out where

29:55.294 --> 29:56.795
Stanley Chao's plane
was secretly landing.

29:56.896 --> 29:57.997
And coming up empty.

29:58.097 --> 29:59.598
That's when I came in
to save the day.

29:59.698 --> 30:00.766
That's when
she came to ask

30:00.867 --> 30:02.201
for my assistance. Okay.

30:02.301 --> 30:03.936
The real clue wasn't in
the flight manifest.

30:04.036 --> 30:05.905
It was in the chemical makeup
of the fentanyl itself.

30:06.005 --> 30:08.875
You should tell
them what <i>we</i> found.

30:08.975 --> 30:10.742
Someone should.

30:10.843 --> 30:12.378
The fentanyl
we're dealing with

30:12.478 --> 30:13.579
is nearly 100% pure.

30:13.679 --> 30:14.881
Which means, of course,

30:14.981 --> 30:16.582
it's a fraction
of a percent impure.

30:16.682 --> 30:18.650
And it's that fraction that
gives the whole operation away.

30:18.750 --> 30:21.954
It's mostly
sulfur dioxide.

30:26.025 --> 30:28.160
I know we're supposed
to be impressed.

30:28.260 --> 30:29.828
There's only one
place in Hawai'i where

30:29.929 --> 30:31.330
there's a higher-than-normal
amount of sulfur dioxide.

30:31.430 --> 30:32.564
Kilauea.

30:32.664 --> 30:34.266
The cartel is manufacturing fentanyl

30:34.366 --> 30:36.535
near an active volcano.
It's a great cover for them.

30:36.635 --> 30:39.038
Remote, far from prying eyes,
hard to spot.

30:39.138 --> 30:42.341
Hard, but not impossible.

30:46.378 --> 30:48.447
Call REACT, let Jesse
and Kai know.

30:48.547 --> 30:51.183
We're bringing these guys down.

31:01.961 --> 31:05.331
Estimating ten,
maybe 12 suspects.

31:05.431 --> 31:07.833
Several armed, all with
protective gear and respirators.

31:07.934 --> 31:10.369
Respirators mean
the drugs are inside.

31:10.469 --> 31:12.838
Drugs aren't the only thing
that's inside.

31:14.740 --> 31:16.542
I got eyes on Tyler.

31:21.113 --> 31:22.748
And a lot of fentanyl.

31:22.848 --> 31:23.983
So we're a go to breach?

31:24.083 --> 31:26.818
It's not that simple, Lucy.

31:26.919 --> 31:29.121
We got our drugs, the bad guys,
our missing man.

31:29.221 --> 31:31.924
And a lot of guns
and volatile chemicals in there.

31:32.024 --> 31:33.359
If we go in hard,

31:33.459 --> 31:35.161
a stray bullet hits those drugs,
they aerosolize.

31:35.261 --> 31:36.662
Tyler's a
sitting duck.

31:36.762 --> 31:38.130
Need to get him out now.

31:38.230 --> 31:39.865
If we go in now, there's
a good chance Tyler dies.

31:39.966 --> 31:41.833
Hey, we stay put,
he definitely dies.

31:41.934 --> 31:44.136
So, two bad options.

31:44.937 --> 31:46.205
I got a third.

31:46.305 --> 31:49.041
I go in, grab him,
get him out before you breach.

31:49.141 --> 31:50.342
That's a terrible idea.

31:50.442 --> 31:52.444
Best bad idea we got.

32:02.021 --> 32:03.689
Jesse, what the hell
are you doing?

32:03.789 --> 32:05.557
Grabbing the kid
and getting him to safety.

32:05.657 --> 32:06.892
That's a terrible idea.

32:06.993 --> 32:08.460
That's what I said.

32:08.560 --> 32:09.962
Going in alone
surrounded by armed suspects?

32:10.062 --> 32:11.597
I learned from
watching you, boss.

32:11.697 --> 32:13.065
Can we at least
take a beat here?

32:13.165 --> 32:14.866
Not really. I'm steps away.

32:14.967 --> 32:17.136
And I'm the only good shot
at getting Tyler back safely.

32:17.236 --> 32:19.905
Okay, Kai, I want you
and REACT ready to move

32:20.006 --> 32:22.708
the moment Jesse
and Tyler are clear.

32:22.808 --> 32:24.610
All right.

32:24.710 --> 32:26.712
Ready to roll.
Okay, Jesse.

32:26.812 --> 32:28.280
Go for it.

32:47.466 --> 32:49.668
I swear,
I didn't tell anyone.

32:49.768 --> 32:51.503
It was just me and Cameron.

32:51.603 --> 32:53.405
Shh. Quiet.
It was just
me and Cameron.

32:53.505 --> 32:55.907
I said shut up.
Please don't
hurt me anymore.

32:56.008 --> 32:57.476
Hey, kid.

32:57.576 --> 32:59.711
See what it says
on my chest?

32:59.811 --> 33:01.713
I'm the good guys.
You're getting me
out of here?

33:01.813 --> 33:04.616
Yeah, if you close your
mouth for two seconds.

33:10.122 --> 33:11.357
Can you walk?

33:11.457 --> 33:12.624
Yeah, I think so.

33:16.995 --> 33:19.898
You really are a pain
in my ass. Come on.

33:19.998 --> 33:21.833
All right, I got Tyler.
We're coming out.

33:21.933 --> 33:23.001
Jesse, wait.

33:23.102 --> 33:24.136
Jesse.

33:28.840 --> 33:29.875
Hey there.

33:33.679 --> 33:34.846
Kai, what's going on there?

33:34.946 --> 33:36.615
No visual on Jesse.

33:41.920 --> 33:43.522
We got gunshots!

33:43.622 --> 33:45.157
Kai, breach now!

33:45.757 --> 33:47.993
Federal agents!
Put your guns down!

33:57.002 --> 33:58.670
Put this on.

34:10.216 --> 34:11.383
Put your guns down!

34:11.483 --> 34:13.119
Guns down!

34:13.219 --> 34:14.553
Come out with your hands up!

34:14.653 --> 34:17.022
Hands up. Come out.

34:17.889 --> 34:20.592
Exterior clear.
What about Jesse?

34:21.860 --> 34:24.130
Go.

34:24.230 --> 34:27.333
Hey. You good?

34:27.433 --> 34:30.202
Yeah, I'm just a bit dizzy,
but otherwise...

34:33.139 --> 34:34.673
Jesse...

34:35.474 --> 34:36.708
Hey, hey, talk to me.

34:36.808 --> 34:39.978
Get to that Narcan, Kai.

34:40.912 --> 34:41.747
He's seizing.

34:41.847 --> 34:43.149
Hang in there, man.

34:46.552 --> 34:48.620
Hang in there, Jesse. Come on.

34:48.720 --> 34:50.622
Administering Narcan now.

34:52.358 --> 34:54.460
Hey, Jesse.

34:55.661 --> 34:58.063
Hey, hey.

34:58.164 --> 34:59.931
His pulse is thready.

35:00.031 --> 35:01.500
Come on.

35:01.600 --> 35:03.469
Hang in there, Jesse, come on!

35:06.372 --> 35:08.940
I got you. Hey.

35:11.477 --> 35:12.644
Come on, Jesse.

35:12.744 --> 35:14.112
No breath sounds.

35:17.683 --> 35:19.751
Come on, Jesse.

35:19.851 --> 35:22.988
Come on, Jesse.

35:23.088 --> 35:25.191
Hey.

35:26.992 --> 35:28.860
Come on.

35:29.695 --> 35:31.463
I got you. I got you.

35:31.563 --> 35:33.665
We got him. He's back.

35:33.765 --> 35:35.634
We got him back.

35:35.734 --> 35:37.936
I feel like crap.

35:51.149 --> 35:52.751
Hey.

35:52.851 --> 35:55.487
Hey, shouldn't you
be at the hospital?

35:55.587 --> 35:57.489
Yeah, well, I got
a clean bill of health.

35:57.589 --> 35:59.258
And I wanted to
personally escort

35:59.358 --> 36:01.026
Tyler back here
for questioning.

36:01.827 --> 36:03.462
That kid's been through a lot.

36:03.562 --> 36:05.364
Kid's also responsible
for this whole mess.

36:05.464 --> 36:07.699
Caldero cartel did more
than their fair share.

36:07.799 --> 36:10.001
And we shut their
operation down.

36:10.101 --> 36:12.204
Took a lot of drugs
off the streets.

36:12.304 --> 36:14.506
For now.
There'll be more.

36:14.606 --> 36:17.709
As it's always been. Yeah.

36:17.809 --> 36:19.645
Fentanyl is different.

36:19.745 --> 36:21.179
I mean, people don't
think it's dangerous

36:21.280 --> 36:23.782
'cause it's prescription,
but this street stuff...

36:23.882 --> 36:25.484
It's insidious. Yeah.

36:25.584 --> 36:27.152
And dealers mix it
with other drugs.

36:27.253 --> 36:29.020
Some kid could be
at a party and take a hit

36:29.120 --> 36:31.757
from a joint
and die in an instant.

36:33.525 --> 36:35.661
Some kid?

36:36.628 --> 36:38.997
Our kids.

36:39.097 --> 36:40.666
You worried
about Gracie?

36:40.766 --> 36:43.369
Yeah, almost constantly.

36:43.469 --> 36:46.171
What about you?
Same.

36:46.272 --> 36:48.607
Though right now,
I'm trying to keep Alex

36:48.707 --> 36:51.142
from running to Europe
with his girlfriend.

36:51.243 --> 36:52.210
Oh, yeah?

36:52.311 --> 36:53.712
That's a new one.

36:53.812 --> 36:55.747
Luckily, he doesn't have
the money to pay for it.

36:55.847 --> 36:57.182
Perfect.

36:58.083 --> 37:00.786
Oh, look, it's my hero.

37:04.055 --> 37:05.624
Yep, okay,
that's two you owe me.

37:05.724 --> 37:08.327
Yeah, well, Heather's
baking you a cake.

37:08.427 --> 37:10.028
You headed home?

37:10.128 --> 37:13.098
Yeah. Hey, you cool
with that job for Alex?

37:14.733 --> 37:16.402
What job for Alex is that?

37:16.502 --> 37:17.636
At my dad's restaurant.

37:17.736 --> 37:19.037
Hina hired him for weekends.

37:19.137 --> 37:21.006
Something about earning
money for a trip.

37:24.476 --> 37:26.812
When did
this happen?

37:26.912 --> 37:30.215
Uh, today, I guess,
while we were fighting crime.

37:35.687 --> 37:39.791
Yeah, sure, I'm cool. Yeah.

37:46.932 --> 37:49.167
Hey, you're here late.

37:49.267 --> 37:51.537
Mm-hmm, I offered
to do Jesse's paperwork

37:51.637 --> 37:53.472
since he almost
died today and all.

37:53.572 --> 37:54.673
How long is he gonna milk that?

37:54.773 --> 37:56.408
Oh, weeks, I'm sure.

37:56.508 --> 37:58.109
What's your excuse?

37:58.209 --> 38:00.646
I'm just reading up on, uh,
South Carolina real estate law.

38:00.746 --> 38:02.113
Ah, your dad's house.

38:02.213 --> 38:04.450
Yep, gotta get rid
of it somehow.

38:04.550 --> 38:07.185
'Cause you're trying to get
rid of any connection to him?

38:09.154 --> 38:10.956
Nice try.

38:11.056 --> 38:13.158
Still don't want
to talk about it.

38:13.258 --> 38:15.093
And I respect that.

38:15.193 --> 38:17.829
But you should know that
if you want to get rid

38:17.929 --> 38:19.898
of that house,
I happen to live with

38:19.998 --> 38:22.601
a very talented
former lawyer

38:22.701 --> 38:24.336
who loves
dissecting contracts.

38:24.436 --> 38:26.472
And kicking legal butt.

38:26.572 --> 38:27.906
Thanks, Luce.

38:28.006 --> 38:29.541
I might just take
you up on that.

38:29.641 --> 38:31.109
Okay, good. You should.

38:36.147 --> 38:38.750
My father wasn't around
much when I was little.

38:42.988 --> 38:44.990
Usually, he was
with a girlfriend.

38:45.090 --> 38:47.393
When my mom finally
kicked him out,

38:47.493 --> 38:50.462
I was maybe... seven.

38:50.562 --> 38:52.330
He wasn't around at all.

38:53.832 --> 38:56.067
Man, I'm sorry.

38:57.703 --> 38:59.838
He...

38:59.938 --> 39:01.973
lived maybe a mile
from my place.

39:02.073 --> 39:03.775
Two-minute drive.

39:03.875 --> 39:05.744
He wouldn't come.

39:05.844 --> 39:08.714
Not for birthdays or
graduations or holidays.

39:10.949 --> 39:14.753
I got past it, learned to
accept it, you know?

39:16.221 --> 39:18.457
It was just
me and my mom.

39:18.557 --> 39:20.492
Didn't bother me.
He didn't want to see me.

39:20.592 --> 39:22.561
I didn't want to
see him, either.

39:22.661 --> 39:25.296
I threw myself into my school.

39:25.397 --> 39:27.499
Did my own thing.

39:27.599 --> 39:30.536
And I got accepted into
every college I applied for

39:30.636 --> 39:32.370
with a full ride.

39:32.471 --> 39:34.205
Oof.

39:34.305 --> 39:36.742
And that is when
I went to go see him.

39:36.842 --> 39:38.777
Two minutes away.

39:38.877 --> 39:41.680
To show him what
I did without him.

39:41.780 --> 39:44.416
And what happened?

39:44.516 --> 39:46.485
He wasn't there.

39:47.819 --> 39:49.555
He'd moved away.

39:49.655 --> 39:51.790
Like, months before...

39:51.890 --> 39:54.059
to South Carolina.

39:54.159 --> 39:56.762
The house
you inherited?

39:56.862 --> 39:59.197
