WEBVTT

00:05.005 --> 00:06.791
- ( roars )
- Gannicus has proven himself.

00:06.965 --> 00:08.921
Let him be rewarded
with freedom.

00:09.092 --> 00:10.502
You have earned the rudis--

00:10.677 --> 00:13.464
proof you no longer stand
a slave.

00:13.639 --> 00:16.847
Your wife betrayed you--
one last fuck.

00:17.017 --> 00:19.349
And we will fight until
the last drop of Roman blood--

00:19.520 --> 00:21.260
lam not a Roman.

00:21.438 --> 00:22.473
( man grunts)

00:22.648 --> 00:24.855
- Naevia is dead.
- ( screaming )

00:25.025 --> 00:27.357
- Fucking shit!
- |'|| fucking kill you.

00:27.528 --> 00:29.359
- Have you lost mind?
- Naevia lives.

00:31.198 --> 00:32.563
lwill not fucking die
for this.

00:32.741 --> 00:35.858
( men shouting in distance)

00:36.036 --> 00:38.118
- ( grunting )
- Crixus!

00:38.288 --> 00:40.119
Varinius: Let these men
not fall here tonight,

00:40.290 --> 00:42.406
but in the arena,
before all of Capua!

00:42.584 --> 00:44.961
Gain your father's approval
to dissolve your marriage,

00:45.128 --> 00:47.380
and find me as wet with desire

00:47.548 --> 00:49.880
as you now stand.

00:50.050 --> 00:52.211
(theme music playing )

00:57.391 --> 01:01.054
Crowd:
Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

01:01.228 --> 01:04.220
Kill! Kill! Kill!

01:08.569 --> 01:10.605
( distant crowd roaring )

01:25.752 --> 01:28.459
( crowd stomping )

01:32.259 --> 01:34.295
( crowd chanting )

01:36.388 --> 01:37.628
Boo!

01:38.765 --> 01:40.426
(hï¬‚thuds)

01:55.866 --> 01:58.107
(shouting )

02:12.257 --> 02:15.465
Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

02:30.025 --> 02:31.606
A fine showing.

02:31.777 --> 02:33.768
To be forever remembered
by adoring crowd,

02:33.945 --> 02:35.981
as will the name Varinius,

02:36.156 --> 02:37.987
who bestows such
generous gifts.

02:39.076 --> 02:41.818
Indeed, he shall never be
forgotten.

02:41.995 --> 02:43.701
Same cannot be said
of all men.

02:46.083 --> 02:48.244
Would that more
stood your equal.

02:49.252 --> 02:52.119
A pity there is but one of him,
so soon recalled to Rome.

02:52.297 --> 02:54.379
Magistrate:
A brief yet profitable stay.

02:54.549 --> 02:56.540
Your games have given
the city much needed

02:56.718 --> 02:58.674
distraction in these
dark times.

02:58.845 --> 03:00.221
( fanfare )

03:00.389 --> 03:02.345
The executions begin.

03:02.516 --> 03:04.472
A glorious finale
to our stay at Capua.

03:04.643 --> 03:06.599
If only Spartacus
were among the condemned.

03:06.770 --> 03:09.603
The man shall be put to grass
soon enough, Mercato.

03:09.773 --> 03:12.230
My men move towards
this very purpose.

03:12.401 --> 03:14.517
Until such a time,
let us send message

03:14.695 --> 03:16.526
punctuated in blood.

03:16.697 --> 03:19.154
( crowd cheering )

03:19.324 --> 03:22.361
( cheering subsides )

03:22.536 --> 03:24.697
"Hannibal stands at our gates"--

03:24.871 --> 03:27.783
a phrase used to invoke fear

03:27.958 --> 03:30.199
among the children of Rome,

03:30.377 --> 03:32.538
a specter
of the Carthaginian animal

03:32.713 --> 03:34.328
who besieged this city

03:34.506 --> 03:36.963
with terror and death
many years past.

03:37.134 --> 03:40.342
Yet, as is the fate
of all enemies of the Republic,

03:40.512 --> 03:42.173
Hannibal passed from this life

03:42.347 --> 03:44.053
at the end of a Roman sword!

03:44.224 --> 03:45.839
( cheering )

03:46.017 --> 03:48.224
A fate that will
one day be shared

03:51.898 --> 03:53.763
Was it not your
distant relative,

03:53.942 --> 03:55.523
Appius Claudius Pulcher,

03:55.694 --> 03:57.400
who failed to defeat Hannibal

03:57.571 --> 03:59.562
in the first battle of Capua?

04:01.241 --> 04:02.481
It was.

04:02.659 --> 04:03.819
( chuckles )

04:05.996 --> 04:08.328
The gods have yet to bless us
with such glorious sight.

04:08.498 --> 04:11.240
Yet they grace us
with portent upon horizon--

04:11.418 --> 04:14.205
three of Spartacus's
most trusted men,

04:14.379 --> 04:16.586
their deaths to serve
as warning

04:16.757 --> 04:18.543
to all who would
challenge Rome!

04:20.135 --> 04:22.091
( crowd jeering )

04:22.262 --> 04:24.469
Boo!

04:26.933 --> 04:28.673
Man: Kill those bastards!

04:28.852 --> 04:31.514
Woman: Get ready to die,
you fuckers!

04:34.941 --> 04:37.273
Varinius: They've got to be shed
ad gladium

04:37.444 --> 04:39.480
by the warriors
whose victories this day

04:39.654 --> 04:42.270
have earned them
position in the Primus.

04:42.449 --> 04:45.236
Yet who shall lead
the forces of Rome?

04:45.410 --> 04:48.618
Who deserves
such storied mantle?

04:48.789 --> 04:50.495
There stands but one--

04:50.665 --> 04:53.372
the only gladiator
from this fair city

04:53.543 --> 04:56.250
to ever earn his freedom
upon the sands,

04:56.421 --> 04:58.582
a true god of the arena.

04:58.757 --> 05:01.419
I give you Gannicus!

05:01.593 --> 05:03.834
( crowd cheering )

05:08.892 --> 05:12.680
Gannicus! Gannicus! Gannicus!

05:12.854 --> 05:15.186
Gannicus! Gannicus!

05:23.156 --> 05:24.987
Woman:
Fuck me, Gannicus!

05:25.158 --> 05:28.400
Man: Come on, Gannicus,
kill them all!

05:30.163 --> 05:31.994
Why would he do this?

05:32.165 --> 05:34.372
Because he's a man
without honor.

05:44.553 --> 05:46.839
We at last face each other
upon the sands...

05:48.473 --> 05:50.930
as Melitta always feared.

05:59.526 --> 06:01.187
Is it true?

06:02.445 --> 06:04.652
Did you lay with her

06:04.823 --> 06:07.030
the night she left this world?

06:09.202 --> 06:10.362
Oenomaus--

06:15.375 --> 06:16.911
Begin.

06:38.440 --> 06:40.897
We should not have torn
our forces.

06:41.067 --> 06:42.807
If we had been
with you at the mines--

06:42.986 --> 06:46.228
Even more would lay dead
within its tunnels.

06:48.491 --> 06:51.073
Mistakes were made
on both sides.

06:53.788 --> 06:57.497
Let us place them behind us,
or risk finding them repeated.

06:59.127 --> 07:01.118
(wings fluttering )

07:13.725 --> 07:15.761
We have found something.

07:28.907 --> 07:31.819
Finally the gods show
a fucking favor.

07:34.120 --> 07:36.372
Let us see to what extent.

07:54.307 --> 07:56.138
Bring the others.

07:59.354 --> 08:01.640
Search for weapons.
Something may have been left behind.

08:08.571 --> 08:10.653
A roof over our heads.

08:11.658 --> 08:13.944
Mostly.

08:14.119 --> 08:17.327
We shall take rest,
consider future.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.613
There holds none for you

08:19.791 --> 08:22.828
in my fucking temple.

08:23.003 --> 08:24.584
Apologies.

08:25.630 --> 08:27.006
It appeared abandoned.

08:27.173 --> 08:29.164
I stand proof it is not.

08:30.176 --> 08:33.009
Return to where you came.

08:41.354 --> 08:45.063
So the gods finally
fuck me to the afterlife.

08:46.067 --> 08:48.023
Care to join me?

08:48.194 --> 08:50.230
We seek only shelter...

08:52.782 --> 08:53.942
nothing more.

08:56.119 --> 08:57.279
Spartacus.

08:57.454 --> 08:59.820
You are Spartacus?

08:59.998 --> 09:01.534
lam.

09:06.963 --> 09:09.955
Then I mistake
fucking for blessing.

09:10.133 --> 09:11.464
(laughing)

09:14.345 --> 09:18.338
This temple has remained
absent worship for many years.

09:18.516 --> 09:21.553
It does not offer much
in the way of comforts,

09:21.728 --> 09:24.891
but I would share what I have.

09:25.065 --> 09:26.726
Gratitude.

09:26.900 --> 09:29.607
You would trust wine and words
from a Roman shit?

09:29.778 --> 09:31.564
And what are you?

09:32.864 --> 09:34.400
A Gaul, by your
lack of manners?

09:34.574 --> 09:36.155
lam no fucking Gaul.

09:36.326 --> 09:38.908
lam Agron, from the lands
east of the Rhine.

09:39.079 --> 09:41.946
And lam Lucius,
a Roman of the Caelian clan.

09:42.123 --> 09:44.660
A pleasure to make
fucking acquaintance.

09:46.294 --> 09:48.285
Why are you here, Lucius?

09:49.881 --> 09:54.250
I did have more
esteemed lodgings once--

09:54.427 --> 09:56.088
a villa,

09:56.262 --> 09:59.254
land, horses,

09:59.432 --> 10:01.514
a family,

10:01.684 --> 10:05.393
struck from this world
by Sulla's black heart.

10:05.563 --> 10:06.939
Sulla?

10:07.107 --> 10:08.938
He too was a Roman,

10:09.109 --> 10:10.815
yet marched upon
his own people,

10:10.985 --> 10:12.850
punishing any
who dared to defy him.

10:13.029 --> 10:15.270
A slave is so treated.

10:18.451 --> 10:20.863
l have owned them.

10:22.956 --> 10:24.912
If that be offense enough,

10:25.083 --> 10:27.074
have my life.

10:28.962 --> 10:30.452
Wine's gone anyway.

10:33.091 --> 10:36.879
Your eyes seemed to brighten
when you heard my name--

10:37.053 --> 10:38.793
unexpected from a Roman.

10:40.515 --> 10:42.847
The ones I held to heart

10:43.017 --> 10:45.850
were slaughtered by the same.

10:46.020 --> 10:48.762
They stand no kin to me now.

10:50.275 --> 10:53.392
And yet

10:53.570 --> 10:56.061
the man who
would make them suffer,

10:56.239 --> 10:59.026
lwould gladly call brother.

11:02.120 --> 11:05.157
You could not have made speech
before swilling the last of the wine?

11:05.331 --> 11:07.947
( Lucius laughs) lfl had I known
you were for this temple,

11:08.126 --> 11:11.209
I'd have stocked it
to the fucking rafters.

11:14.966 --> 11:18.584
I thought the lot of you fallen
in the mines of Lucania.

11:18.761 --> 11:21.013
Where have you heard such tales?

11:21.181 --> 11:23.843
In the streets of Neapolis,
frequented for trading.

11:24.017 --> 11:26.508
The city is afire
with news of your defeat,

11:26.686 --> 11:29.928
the only survivors to be executed
at Varinius's fucking games.

11:30.106 --> 11:32.438
- Survivors?
- Give names.

11:32.609 --> 11:35.476
I know only that three
stand for the sands

11:35.653 --> 11:39.271
and one by word marked
as the Undefeated Gaul.

11:39.449 --> 11:42.657
Crixus?

11:42.827 --> 11:44.988
He yet lives?

11:45.163 --> 11:49.122
Only to see sun
break dawn once more.

11:49.292 --> 11:52.455
The games come to an end
when it sets,

11:52.629 --> 11:55.041
as do the lives of your men.

12:02.555 --> 12:04.591
( footsteps )

12:21.115 --> 12:23.606
Spartacus yet evades death.

12:23.785 --> 12:26.071
While we fucking embrace it.

12:27.705 --> 12:29.616
As I will embrace Naevia

12:29.791 --> 12:32.749
when she is returned to my arms
in the afterlife...

12:35.421 --> 12:37.457
where Melitta awaits you.

12:41.302 --> 12:44.385
I long for reunion

12:44.555 --> 12:46.932
and the answers it will bring.

13:00.029 --> 13:02.111
How you will stir the crowd!

13:02.282 --> 13:04.989
Tales of the prowess
of Gannicus yet fill the air,

13:05.159 --> 13:07.024
rivaling those
of Hercules himself.

13:07.203 --> 13:09.319
His labors were rewarded
with immortality.

13:09.497 --> 13:12.204
Fortunate for you,
I seek more earthly payment.

13:12.375 --> 13:15.242
To be provided upon
completion of your services.

13:15.420 --> 13:17.456
| find myself light of coin.

13:17.630 --> 13:19.621
A few dropped in hand
would anchor purpose.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.586
Of course.

13:22.760 --> 13:24.466
I would not wish to see wind
carry you aloft

13:24.637 --> 13:26.298
short of the appointed hour.

13:29.392 --> 13:31.132
I shall see it done.

13:31.311 --> 13:34.018
It will be glorious spectacle.

13:34.188 --> 13:36.019
Come. lwould present you
to the Magistrate

13:36.190 --> 13:37.646
and Praetor Varinius
himself.

13:37.817 --> 13:39.603
Let them gaze upon
the legend in the arena,

13:39.777 --> 13:41.893
with the rest
of the howling mob.

13:42.071 --> 13:43.811
lam for wine

13:43.990 --> 13:46.652
and the embrace
of questionable women.

14:02.216 --> 14:03.752
How did he fall?

14:03.926 --> 14:06.759
We came upon Spartacus
and his men while giving chase.

14:06.929 --> 14:09.545
The villain himself
delivered grievous injury.

14:09.724 --> 14:13.558
And yet you stand before me,
drawing breath.

14:13.728 --> 14:16.310
I came to your tribune's aid,
pulling him away

14:16.481 --> 14:18.688
to staunch life
flowing from wound.

14:18.858 --> 14:21.440
Noble effort, bearing no fruit.

14:21.611 --> 14:23.567
- Praetor--
- Send word to Senator Albinius.

14:23.738 --> 14:27.447
Spartacus will not be among the slaves
executed at tomorrow's games.

14:27.617 --> 14:29.403
- And the Syrian?
- Oh, he will yet have chance

14:29.577 --> 14:31.613
to afford himself in battle,
in the arena,

14:31.788 --> 14:33.779
to be executed with
the other worthless slaves.

14:33.956 --> 14:35.332
No. Praetor, I beg of you.

14:35.500 --> 14:37.115
Praeto r!

14:49.097 --> 14:51.213
Yet another disappointment.

14:51.391 --> 14:54.258
Spartacus evades
poor Gaius once again.

14:55.895 --> 14:58.136
I fear your games will suffer
from the Thracian's absence.

14:58.314 --> 15:00.805
Good Mercato
assures me grand spectacle

15:00.983 --> 15:03.395
to be spoken of for years
throughout the Republic.

15:03.569 --> 15:06.276
I would not have your husband's
failure dampen spirits.

15:06.447 --> 15:08.483
As I would not have him
remain so titled.

15:08.658 --> 15:10.489
The very purpose
of our gathering.

15:10.660 --> 15:13.572
News of your desires
towards loving daughter

15:13.746 --> 15:16.158
lifts heart.

15:16.332 --> 15:19.574
l have invoked the god Hymenaeus
to sanction the union.

15:19.752 --> 15:21.367
His blessing is affirmed.

15:21.546 --> 15:24.413
The gods bestow gift
beyond measure.

15:24.590 --> 15:26.455
Albinius: Yet we must proceed
with caution.

15:26.634 --> 15:28.670
I would not have Gaius
aware of our plans

15:28.845 --> 15:31.712
until presented with dissolution,
lets he make public scene.

15:31.889 --> 15:34.505
Let us take leave
and further discuss how to proceed.

15:34.684 --> 15:37.050
I long for constraints
to be shed

15:37.228 --> 15:39.093
and our fortunes
returned to Rome.

15:39.272 --> 15:43.265
As I long for you by my side,
holding position of wife.

15:49.115 --> 15:50.776
He appears well pleased.

15:52.785 --> 15:54.571
Remove encumbrance
as discussed,

15:54.745 --> 15:57.236
and we will see this
to proper end.

16:00.793 --> 16:02.875
Encumbrance?

16:03.045 --> 16:06.458
I am to untether myself
from unfortunate lineage.

16:07.467 --> 16:09.628
You would see your child
never born?

16:11.012 --> 16:12.923
A necessary thing

16:13.097 --> 16:14.883
to ensure a more worthy heir.

16:28.321 --> 16:30.152
lam in your debt.

16:31.365 --> 16:33.105
Spartacus told me
what you have done for Nasir.

16:33.284 --> 16:34.319
If it were not for you--

16:34.494 --> 16:36.450
It's because of me
that he lays near death.

16:36.621 --> 16:39.363
They never should have
come to the mines.

16:40.416 --> 16:42.452
I did what I could to stop them.

16:42.627 --> 16:44.663
Would that you had done more.

16:44.837 --> 16:45.997
Naevia.

16:46.172 --> 16:50.165
The hope of seeing Crixus again
was all that kept me alive.

16:51.677 --> 16:54.669
Each day I begged the gods

16:54.847 --> 16:57.384
to see him to my arms.

16:57.558 --> 17:00.015
And this is how
they fucking answer?

17:00.186 --> 17:02.552
By allowing his touch,

17:02.730 --> 17:04.812
only to be ripped
from it forever?

17:04.982 --> 17:08.019
He would not be swayed
from attempt.

17:10.154 --> 17:12.145
None of them would.

17:12.323 --> 17:15.815
lwish Lucretia
had taken my life.

17:17.453 --> 17:20.035
Then Crixus would not have
to sacrificed his

17:20.206 --> 17:22.663
for something soiled
and ruined.

17:22.833 --> 17:25.210
Spartacus calls for you.

17:47.692 --> 17:49.307
Nasir?

17:50.403 --> 17:52.064
He yet fights.

17:53.990 --> 17:55.480
As do we all.

17:56.534 --> 17:59.071
The Romans would have it
believed otherwise.

18:00.246 --> 18:03.909
Lucius tells of spreading word
that we are all but defeated.

18:04.083 --> 18:06.745
Let them come
and find assumption false.

18:06.919 --> 18:09.752
I would not wait for such a day,

18:09.922 --> 18:12.208
nor see our brothers
fall in the arena.

18:15.052 --> 18:16.633
You would lay attack
on the arena?

18:18.889 --> 18:21.756
Our numbers are low,
more so of men able with sword.

18:21.934 --> 18:24.266
A thing known by Glaber
and his soldiers.

18:26.522 --> 18:28.228
They would never think us
to make attempt.

18:28.399 --> 18:31.106
- For good fucking reason.
- Who is more familiar with the arena

18:31.277 --> 18:34.064
than men who have fought
upon its sands?

18:41.495 --> 18:43.360
What are your thoughts?

18:43.539 --> 18:46.121
These executions
serve as message

18:46.292 --> 18:48.123
that Rome
will smother any flame

18:48.294 --> 18:50.159
that burns against its rule.

18:53.132 --> 18:55.623
I would send message
of our own,

18:55.801 --> 18:59.134
one that will ignite the hearts
of all yet enslaved.

19:05.686 --> 19:07.677
( footsteps )

19:16.656 --> 19:20.990
'Tis a heavy burden--
stilling life that grows inside you.

19:21.160 --> 19:24.368
I had thought deed
of lighter concern.

19:24.538 --> 19:26.324
I do not know why I pause.

19:26.499 --> 19:29.957
A woman will always be moved
to protect her child.

19:32.046 --> 19:34.162
Yet it must be done.

19:35.633 --> 19:38.170
Perhaps it wise
to delay the act.

19:38.344 --> 19:40.756
Your absence at the games
will draw notice.

19:40.930 --> 19:41.965
My absence?

19:42.139 --> 19:45.552
l have forced silphium
on many slaves

19:45.726 --> 19:48.638
to rid the House of Batiatus
of unwanted burden.

19:48.813 --> 19:51.680
You will sicken and bleed

19:51.857 --> 19:53.893
for many days.

19:55.111 --> 19:57.318
I will attest such to your father.

19:57.488 --> 20:00.025
If he so presses for reason
of staying hand.

20:08.165 --> 20:10.542
You prove wise counsel.

20:16.716 --> 20:19.753
A service I would continue
to provide.

20:21.804 --> 20:23.840
Do you wish to
accompany me to Rome?

20:24.014 --> 20:27.552
| wish only to be at your side

20:27.727 --> 20:30.469
until life leaves from body.

20:33.107 --> 20:35.723
There is yet much
of the past between us.

20:36.819 --> 20:39.686
Let us see
if there is a future.

20:44.910 --> 20:47.071
( door opens)

20:47.246 --> 20:48.907
Guard: Be quick.

20:54.253 --> 20:56.585
( chuckles )

20:56.756 --> 21:00.089
At last she comes.

21:00.259 --> 21:02.796
Other matters have drawn
my attention.

21:02.970 --> 21:07.555
I would see it towards
current fucking plight.

21:08.726 --> 21:11.092
Do you think that I would allow you
to perish upon the sands

21:11.270 --> 21:12.726
after all you have done
for me?

21:12.897 --> 21:15.263
I will break words
with Glaber.

21:15.441 --> 21:17.272
( grunts )
He places blame

21:17.443 --> 21:20.355
for Spartacus
evading capture.

21:22.823 --> 21:24.529
He will not listen to you.

21:24.700 --> 21:27.157
Yet he will heed
the will of the gods,

21:27.328 --> 21:29.944
as he has so graciously
in the past.

21:30.122 --> 21:33.455
I shall whisper of them,
of how you were returned to us

21:33.626 --> 21:35.912
from dark woods for a purpose,

21:36.086 --> 21:38.463
of how the gods
yet have use for you,

21:38.631 --> 21:40.292
as do |.

21:42.760 --> 21:44.250
What would you have
of me now?

21:46.222 --> 21:48.463
A simple task.

21:48.641 --> 21:50.802
There is a red vial

21:50.976 --> 21:53.433
secreted among llithyia's jewelry.

21:53.604 --> 21:56.721
I would see its contents replaced
with water and bitter herb.

21:56.899 --> 22:00.642
I've seen such red vials
within this house before...

22:02.071 --> 22:04.403
- and witnessed their effect.
- And when none are presented,

22:04.573 --> 22:06.734
it will be taken as a sign
that her child must be born.

22:06.909 --> 22:09.901
A task easier seen
by your own hand.

22:10.079 --> 22:12.491
You are close to her
and move freely through the villa.

22:12.665 --> 22:14.155
The risk of discovery
is too great.

22:14.333 --> 22:16.870
llithyia must be given
no reason to doubt me,

22:17.044 --> 22:18.500
or all will fall to ruin.

22:18.671 --> 22:20.252
And how am |
to do such a thing?

22:20.422 --> 22:24.210
Even free of bondage, I am no spirit
able to pass through fucking gate.

22:24.385 --> 22:26.797
Was I not the domina
of this house?

22:30.391 --> 22:32.928
Gates part in remembrance.

22:35.813 --> 22:38.429
You have a way of making a man
invisible as well.

22:38.607 --> 22:41.223
Great spectacle is being made
of the games tomorrow.

22:41.402 --> 22:43.518
llithyia's slaves attend her.

22:43.696 --> 22:46.278
Most of Glaber's men
provide welcome security

22:46.448 --> 22:48.860
to calm nervous city.

22:49.034 --> 22:51.070
It should not be hard
for a man of your talents

22:51.245 --> 22:53.361
to avoid the remainder.

22:53.539 --> 22:54.904
And if I am discovered?

22:55.082 --> 22:56.663
Do not be.

23:03.966 --> 23:07.174
I will see myself
free of bondage

23:07.344 --> 23:09.505
at any cost.

23:12.141 --> 23:13.881
ls such a thing possible?

23:14.059 --> 23:17.051
I would see it so,
or fall with Crixus in the arena.

23:17.229 --> 23:19.766
If the gods yet care,

23:19.940 --> 23:21.931
may they speed your return.

23:22.109 --> 23:23.815
Where do we go?

23:24.862 --> 23:26.523
Nasir.

23:29.074 --> 23:31.065
Give me a sword.
lwill join you.

23:31.243 --> 23:33.529
lwould have you rest
yet a while longer.

23:34.955 --> 23:36.741
This time you stay and | go.

23:45.507 --> 23:47.213
We must move.

23:51.138 --> 23:53.595
The boy cheats death.

23:53.766 --> 23:55.757
Perhaps it is a sign.

23:56.769 --> 23:58.885
We can not rely on omen.

23:59.063 --> 24:01.099
We must take strength
in just cause

24:01.273 --> 24:03.605
and bring it to bear.

24:07.112 --> 24:09.444
You have all heard whispers
of what we attempt.

24:09.615 --> 24:13.608
I would overtake soft voice
with bold words.

24:13.786 --> 24:17.074
We are for the arena in Capua.

24:17.247 --> 24:18.657
Woman: What?

24:18.832 --> 24:20.743
Man: And if you do not return?

24:20.918 --> 24:23.330
Lucius Caelius
knows these lands.

24:23.504 --> 24:25.165
If we are too long from you,

24:25.339 --> 24:27.830
I would ask that
he show you safe path,

24:28.008 --> 24:31.717
far from the reach of Glaber
and his soldiers.

24:33.472 --> 24:35.963
We have suffered wound and loss.

24:36.141 --> 24:38.632
We have been divided.

24:38.811 --> 24:41.644
Yet we are free--

24:41.814 --> 24:44.055
a thing beyond price...

24:45.901 --> 24:47.983
a thing I would see
condemned brothers

24:48.153 --> 24:50.189
embrace once again

24:50.364 --> 24:52.650
and in the doing of it

24:52.825 --> 24:55.532
spread word to every slave
yet beneath heel

24:55.703 --> 24:59.696
that even the mighty Republic
bleeds when struck!

24:59.873 --> 25:01.864
( crowd cheering )

25:02.876 --> 25:04.332
( cheering )

25:29.570 --> 25:32.152
You fuck like a god.

26:00.893 --> 26:02.884
I would share a cup

26:03.062 --> 26:04.723
to regain sense.

26:09.777 --> 26:12.063
l have not seen you here
before, have I?

26:12.237 --> 26:14.899
I've been many years
from Capua.

26:15.074 --> 26:17.235
What brings return?

26:17.409 --> 26:19.320
I come for the games.

26:20.746 --> 26:21.781
| wish I could see them.

26:21.955 --> 26:24.207
I would trade place.

26:24.374 --> 26:26.160
You stand upon the sands

26:26.335 --> 26:30.123
and I will drink and fuck
until the gods take me.

26:30.297 --> 26:32.754
The sands?

26:32.925 --> 26:34.881
You're Gannicus--

26:35.052 --> 26:36.633
the gladiator
who gained his freedom.

26:36.804 --> 26:38.715
Shadow of the same.

26:38.889 --> 26:41.255
I've never heard of another
who's won the rudis.

26:41.433 --> 26:43.048
May I touch it?

26:46.396 --> 26:49.763
These markings--
they tell of your victories?

26:52.611 --> 26:55.023
They tell of glories

26:55.197 --> 26:57.279
long forgotten.

27:00.577 --> 27:02.989
Why do you carry it,
if it troubles mind?

27:04.581 --> 27:06.913
It must always remain
at my side,

27:07.084 --> 27:09.291
even in the arena--

27:09.461 --> 27:12.248
proof that I am
no longer a slave...

27:16.301 --> 27:19.134
reminder of choices
made while I was yet one.

27:22.266 --> 27:25.349
Please, Melitta, breathe!

27:28.772 --> 27:30.728
Let us put talk behind us.

27:30.899 --> 27:33.481
I would fall to bed,

27:33.652 --> 27:37.440
wine and the memory
of your thighs

27:37.614 --> 27:39.479
to brace against coming day.

28:15.402 --> 28:17.142
It is a blessing

28:17.321 --> 28:19.937
to be forever removed
from this fucking house.

28:20.115 --> 28:22.902
May it crumble in our wake.

28:30.542 --> 28:34.205
See them delivered to the arena,
prepared for execution.

28:35.505 --> 28:36.881
Praeto r.

28:38.884 --> 28:41.296
Praetor, apologies.
I would have word.

28:41.470 --> 28:43.381
You draw breath
only because Lucretia cautions

28:43.555 --> 28:45.887
the gods yet foretell
of your worth.

28:46.058 --> 28:48.049
Press me,
and see prophecy ignored.

28:48.227 --> 28:51.435
I but wish to fulfill it
this very day.

28:51.605 --> 28:53.596
-( horse neighs)
- Guard: Ready?

28:53.774 --> 28:55.639
March.

28:55.817 --> 28:59.059
Speak then,
and let us gauge divinity.

29:00.697 --> 29:03.564
My eyes fell upon
most curious sight,

29:03.742 --> 29:05.573
witnessed from my cell--

29:05.744 --> 29:07.575
your wife's slave
stealing through the night,

29:07.746 --> 29:10.533
in her hand
a thing familiar to me,

29:10.707 --> 29:13.369
one I fear

29:13.543 --> 29:16.671
you may have
no knowledge of.

29:16.838 --> 29:18.874
See the litter well stocked
with water and wine.

29:19.049 --> 29:20.755
I would not stand
before Varinius

29:20.926 --> 29:22.837
parched from this fucking heat.

29:23.011 --> 29:24.512
Yes, Domina.

29:25.555 --> 29:27.466
Gaius.

29:27.641 --> 29:30.053
I thought you for the arena
with your men.

29:34.815 --> 29:37.682
Have the gods ever beheld
such beauty?

29:37.859 --> 29:40.271
You flatter.

29:41.405 --> 29:43.862
Leave us.

29:44.992 --> 29:46.857
We will be past
the appointed hour.

29:47.035 --> 29:48.696
They will wait,

29:48.870 --> 29:50.952
as l have waited

29:51.123 --> 29:53.956
for blessings longed for.

29:54.126 --> 29:57.118
'Twill be a glorious day.

29:57.296 --> 30:00.914
One you would see

30:01.091 --> 30:03.457
never arrive.

30:10.475 --> 30:13.182
- Gaius--
- Do not fucking attempt lie!

30:16.606 --> 30:20.269
I know what I hold
and the intent it carries!

30:26.992 --> 30:28.448
Why?

30:31.955 --> 30:33.741
Because you are not
worthy of an heir.

30:35.959 --> 30:38.200
You are not worthy of me.

30:42.299 --> 30:44.381
Have we drifted so far

30:44.551 --> 30:47.588
from the love we once held?

30:47.763 --> 30:49.719
It is a speck

30:49.890 --> 30:51.846
upon distant shore,

30:52.017 --> 30:55.475
too small to draw notice.

30:58.106 --> 31:01.018
lwill hold my child in my arms

31:01.193 --> 31:04.902
and you will play part
of dutiful mother and wife.

31:05.072 --> 31:06.061
lwill not.

31:06.239 --> 31:07.695
You will do as your husband
commands!

31:07.866 --> 31:11.029
Then I pray Varinius
gives them with softer voice.

31:11.203 --> 31:13.159
Varinius?

31:13.330 --> 31:15.036
My father dissolves
our marriage

31:15.207 --> 31:18.665
in favor of more
promising opportunity.

31:18.835 --> 31:21.451
| return with him to Rome
at the close of the games.

31:21.630 --> 31:24.588
You conspire against me.

31:24.758 --> 31:26.464
We do what we must

31:26.635 --> 31:28.626
in face of growing
disappointment.

31:28.804 --> 31:31.341
I will have words
with your father.

31:31.515 --> 31:33.176
To what end?
He allowed you my hand

31:33.350 --> 31:35.090
only because I begged
with teary eye,

31:35.268 --> 31:37.054
wet with thoughts of love.

31:39.898 --> 31:42.560
They now stand dry,

31:42.734 --> 31:45.350
a desert deprived of rain.

31:47.906 --> 31:50.898
Is there nothing left
between us?

31:53.245 --> 31:55.702
Memories only.

31:57.082 --> 31:59.198
Yet they too shall fade.

31:59.376 --> 32:00.866
Come,

32:01.044 --> 32:04.957
let us present ourselves
as husband and wife

32:05.132 --> 32:07.839
for the last time.

32:14.349 --> 32:16.180
( crowd cheering )

32:16.351 --> 32:18.888
(shouting )

32:21.106 --> 32:23.472
The crowd has turned
to sour mood.

32:23.650 --> 32:27.768
We can place no blame,
except perhaps upon cause of delay.

32:28.905 --> 32:31.282
Apologies. My husband
found himself

32:31.450 --> 32:33.441
distracted by
unexpected concerns.

32:33.618 --> 32:35.449
Matters of great import then,

32:35.620 --> 32:37.997
to keep honored guest
and all of Capua waiting.

32:38.165 --> 32:40.781
It was of a pressing nature.

32:40.959 --> 32:43.701
I would condemn such
transgressions to distant past

32:43.879 --> 32:46.541
and turn eye toward
more deserving future.

32:46.715 --> 32:48.831
Such thoughts
kept sleep at bay.

32:49.009 --> 32:52.627
I pray the conclusion of this day
brings you comfort,

32:52.804 --> 32:56.092
as you have brought to all
touched by your divine presence.

32:56.266 --> 32:58.473
Let us begin,
and see it come to pass.

33:04.065 --> 33:06.898
- Woman: What are we waiting for?
- Man: Get on with it!

33:07.068 --> 33:10.060
Citizens of Capua!

33:10.238 --> 33:12.320
We gather this day
to witness an end

33:12.491 --> 33:14.948
to the storied games
of your humble editor

33:15.118 --> 33:17.200
Publius Varinius.

33:18.330 --> 33:21.322
And in their closing,
know that l have not foregone

33:21.500 --> 33:23.286
the mores
of noonday execution

33:23.460 --> 33:27.169
but rather find tradition
exalted to position of the Primus.

33:27.339 --> 33:29.421
And each contest
that leads us to it

33:29.591 --> 33:31.707
shall determine which men
stand worthy

33:31.885 --> 33:33.671
to deliver
the justice of Rome.

33:33.845 --> 33:36.427
( cheering )

33:36.598 --> 33:40.182
Let spectacles of blood
no longer hold pause.

33:40.352 --> 33:43.469
Enter Mycter-- Samnite!

33:50.153 --> 33:52.815
Enter Abiron-- Murmillo!

33:57.369 --> 33:59.735
( screams )

34:00.872 --> 34:04.285
May the gods bless us with a day
forever etched upon memory.

34:05.460 --> 34:06.620
Begin!

34:27.148 --> 34:29.434
Crowd:
Ki||! Ki||! Ki||! Ki||!

34:29.609 --> 34:31.725
Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

34:35.824 --> 34:38.406
( screams )

35:24.539 --> 35:26.325
A display
to shake the heavens.

35:26.499 --> 35:28.911
You possess a gift for
the pairing of gladiators, Mercato.

35:29.085 --> 35:31.497
Have you ever considered
plying such trade in Rome?

35:31.671 --> 35:32.911
You honor me, Praetor.

35:33.089 --> 35:35.000
Yet my fortunes
are tied to Capua.

35:35.175 --> 35:37.791
Is it your intent to spirit away
everyone of note?

35:37.969 --> 35:40.346
l have thoughts toward
but a few.

35:48.980 --> 35:51.892
Your husband's eyes
betray darkening storm.

35:52.067 --> 35:55.184
He has made
unfortunate discovery

35:55.362 --> 35:57.728
within my bedchambers.

35:59.991 --> 36:02.027
Unfortunate indeed.

36:48.373 --> 36:50.955
Varinius: We reach final contest
before the Primus.

36:52.085 --> 36:54.041
Who shall prove himself a god,

36:54.212 --> 36:57.329
worthy to take vengeance
against the enemies of Rome?

36:58.341 --> 37:01.799
Enter Masonius, Hoplomachus!

37:01.970 --> 37:05.007
( crowd cheering )

37:05.181 --> 37:07.172
Enter Strabo, Murmillo!

38:06.910 --> 38:08.741
Kill! Kill! Kill!

38:08.912 --> 38:11.324
( crowd continues chanting )

38:12.457 --> 38:14.789
( crowd cheering )

38:20.757 --> 38:22.918
( roars )

38:23.092 --> 38:24.923
A fine showing.

38:25.094 --> 38:27.551
Magistrate: To be forever remembered
by adoring crowd,

38:27.722 --> 38:29.462
as will the name Varinius,

38:29.641 --> 38:31.472
who bestows such
generous gifts.

38:31.643 --> 38:34.430
Indeed, he shall never be
forgotten.

38:34.604 --> 38:36.140
Same cannot be said
of all men.

38:36.314 --> 38:39.431
( fanfare )

38:39.609 --> 38:41.145
Lucretia:
The executions begin.

38:41.319 --> 38:43.435
( crowd cheering )

38:43.613 --> 38:46.571
Crowd:
Ki||! Ki||! Ki||! Ki||!

38:46.741 --> 38:48.652
Kill! Kill!

38:52.205 --> 38:53.820
Two against an army?

38:53.998 --> 38:55.579
I do not care for your odds.

38:55.750 --> 38:57.456
You will see them
towards our favor.

38:58.795 --> 39:00.285
You are clear
to your purpose?

39:00.463 --> 39:02.454
We will see it done.

39:02.632 --> 39:04.338
It gives strength

39:04.509 --> 39:06.374
knowing you stand with me.

39:15.812 --> 39:17.723
We must work quickly.

39:17.897 --> 39:19.603
If any of you hold faith
in any gods,

39:19.774 --> 39:21.765
now would be time
to fucking entreat them.

39:25.113 --> 39:26.694
Quick. Quick.

39:26.865 --> 39:28.947
"Hannibal stands at our gates"--

39:29.117 --> 39:33.281
a phrase used to invoke fear
among the children of Rome,

39:33.454 --> 39:36.116
a specter
of the Carthaginian animal...

39:36.291 --> 39:38.156
For many years

39:38.334 --> 39:40.791
l have dreamed
of my return to the arena.

39:40.962 --> 39:44.796
It is an honor to stand beside you
upon the sands.

39:44.966 --> 39:48.675
Varinius: Hannibal passed from this life
at the end of a Roman sword!

39:48.845 --> 39:51.962
Guard: Your time has come.

39:52.140 --> 39:54.472
Varinius: A fate that will one day be
shared by the rebel Spartacus!

39:54.642 --> 39:56.633
( crowd cheering )

40:01.482 --> 40:04.519
They give us swords
absent fucking edge.

40:04.694 --> 40:07.231
Absent hope of victory as well.

40:07.405 --> 40:11.148
Then let us prove them fools
for giving us swords at all.

40:12.368 --> 40:14.905
( crowd jeering )

40:18.166 --> 40:20.373
Boo!

40:22.045 --> 40:23.751
Man:
Kill those bastards!

40:23.922 --> 40:25.913
( distant crowd shouting )

40:36.225 --> 40:39.433
Man: You'll die, fuckers!
( laughs)

40:42.440 --> 40:45.432
Woman: I want to see
your insides, prisoners!

40:50.990 --> 40:52.821
( guard shouts)

41:09.801 --> 41:11.337
Gladiator: This day grants us
undeserved honor.

41:11.511 --> 41:13.752
l have longed to share the sands
with Gannicus--

41:13.930 --> 41:16.342
the greatest champion
ever to enter the arena.

41:16.516 --> 41:18.848
There stand no champions here,

41:19.018 --> 41:21.009
only men and their fates.

41:21.187 --> 41:23.348
Varinius: Yet who shall lead
the forces of Rome?

41:24.774 --> 41:28.141
Who deserves such storied mantle?

41:29.153 --> 41:32.395
- You're from the House of Batiatus.
- Varinius: There stands but one.

41:32.573 --> 41:34.074
A lifetime ago.

41:34.242 --> 41:36.153
And now you take
to the sands

41:36.327 --> 41:38.033
to claim the lives
of your brothers?

41:38.204 --> 41:40.570
Gannicus: If they must fall,
I would see them to honorable death...

41:40.748 --> 41:41.828
Varinius: A true god
of the arena.

41:42.000 --> 41:43.786
...given by one who
yet holds them to heart.

41:43.960 --> 41:45.825
Varinius:
I give you Gannicus!

41:47.296 --> 41:49.036
( crowd cheering )

41:49.215 --> 41:50.546
Gannicus!

41:55.888 --> 41:58.550
Woman:
Fuck me, Gannicus!

42:00.268 --> 42:02.680
Man: Kill them, Gannicus!
Kill them all!

42:12.780 --> 42:14.987
Crowd: Gannicus!
Gannicus! Gannicus!

42:15.158 --> 42:17.695
Gannicus! Gannicus! Gannicus!

42:17.869 --> 42:20.451
I begin to question
fucking plan.

42:20.621 --> 42:23.112
We are committed.

42:24.167 --> 42:26.158
Steel nerve and be ready for--

42:26.335 --> 42:28.326
(shouts)

42:45.980 --> 42:47.390
She was my wife...

42:53.279 --> 42:55.486
and you my brother.

42:58.534 --> 43:00.195
He is mine.

43:05.666 --> 43:07.406
This is the place.

43:12.799 --> 43:14.130
You there!

43:14.300 --> 43:16.632
Veronius, send for more men!
Halt!

43:18.596 --> 43:20.928
(screaming )

43:36.197 --> 43:38.313
The Gaul finally nears his end.

43:38.491 --> 43:40.527
A fate long overdue.

44:06.769 --> 44:08.305
They take too long.

44:08.479 --> 44:11.642
We must wait
or see effort fail.

44:18.573 --> 44:20.985
I never wanted to feel
what I felt for her.

44:21.159 --> 44:22.820
I never wanted any of this.

44:47.226 --> 44:48.386
Rhaskos!

44:56.235 --> 44:57.850
- Fuck.
- Wait.

45:16.714 --> 45:18.079
Kill! Kill! Kill!

45:19.425 --> 45:21.416
It's not working fast enough.

45:22.845 --> 45:25.837
The chains--
wrap them around the supports.

45:30.895 --> 45:32.180
Boo!

45:41.405 --> 45:42.736
Yeah!

45:59.590 --> 46:00.705
Pull!

46:03.636 --> 46:05.001
Pull!

46:30.413 --> 46:32.950
I will send you
to her arms, brother.

46:34.542 --> 46:36.123
Pull!

46:39.630 --> 46:42.121
(screaming )

47:00.276 --> 47:01.436
Now!

47:30.056 --> 47:31.637
What's happening?

47:31.807 --> 47:33.092
Let's get out of here!

47:37.480 --> 47:39.892
Clear way!
Clear fucking way!

47:53.579 --> 47:55.365
Mercato!

47:57.249 --> 47:58.455
Mercato!

47:59.502 --> 48:00.537
Mercato!

48:03.214 --> 48:05.000
I would see us gone
from here, brother.

48:06.425 --> 48:08.837
Kill them!

48:51.679 --> 48:53.294
Give hand!

49:20.124 --> 49:21.955
Spartacus.

49:29.175 --> 49:31.382
(screaming )

49:31.552 --> 49:33.042
Cossutius!

49:48.486 --> 49:50.022
The path is clear!

49:55.242 --> 49:57.233
Spartacus once again
makes fool of you.

49:57.411 --> 49:59.993
Your days in the Senate
have found their end.

50:31.278 --> 50:33.394
Spartacus, we must move!

50:33.572 --> 50:36.279
No. We must find Oenomaus.

50:38.410 --> 50:39.741
This way.

50:41.830 --> 50:44.242
(wheezing, coughing)

50:50.548 --> 50:52.288
Gaius.

50:52.466 --> 50:56.584
Help me, please.
Help me, please.

51:10.651 --> 51:13.108
I'm not the fool
you and your daughter think me.

51:43.392 --> 51:45.303
Help me with him.

51:51.442 --> 51:53.023
( loud crashing )

52:17.009 --> 52:18.795
Go. |wi|| follow.

52:41.867 --> 52:43.368
Spartacus.

52:48.832 --> 52:51.995
l have had my fill of games.
Let us leave this arena forever.

52:56.674 --> 52:58.210
Citizens!

52:58.384 --> 53:01.000
Citizens, calm yourselves!

53:02.012 --> 53:03.172
Gather your fucking men.

53:03.347 --> 53:05.338
Come. I would see you safe
to the villa.

53:08.727 --> 53:10.968
Gaius, where is my father?

53:12.439 --> 53:15.476
He has fallen
at the hands of Spartacus.

53:27.621 --> 53:29.407
Shh.

53:30.999 --> 53:33.536
We will survive this

53:33.711 --> 53:35.247
together...

53:38.465 --> 53:40.956
as husband and wife.

54:11.707 --> 54:13.868
(theme music playing )
