WEBVTT

00:15.724 --> 00:16.725
You okay?

00:16.725 --> 00:19.478
Yeah. Sorry, just depressurizing.

00:19.478 --> 00:21.355
You know what I'm like
when I have to use the satnav.

00:21.355 --> 00:22.272
Yeah.

00:22.272 --> 00:25.067
Do you know how many insurance claims
due to satnav-related accidents

00:25.067 --> 00:26.318
I see every year in my job?

00:27.110 --> 00:30.030
Loads. Yeah, almost a quarter of the
country has had one.

00:31.740 --> 00:33.158
Sorry, no work talk.

00:33.158 --> 00:34.952
This break's all about family time.

00:34.952 --> 00:37.788
I am really glad we're doing this.
Just the three of us.

00:39.373 --> 00:40.791
Just the three of us?

00:42.167 --> 00:45.087
It's just, when you said family time, I--

00:45.087 --> 00:49.925
Over here! We made it!

00:49.925 --> 00:51.426
- Hey!
- Hey.

00:52.636 --> 00:54.471
You invited your parents.

00:54.471 --> 00:55.973
Sorry. That's not a problem, is it?

00:55.973 --> 00:58.642
No. No, don't be silly.
No, it's fine. No, it's lovely.

00:59.226 --> 01:01.311
Great. Vedges!

01:01.311 --> 01:04.480
Assemble!

01:06.483 --> 01:09.486
- Yay!
- Yay!

01:09.486 --> 01:13.240
- Here's the pop star.
- Here she is. Say hi.

01:13.240 --> 01:14.950
- Hello.
- Hi, Lisa!

01:14.950 --> 01:17.494
Is she okay? She looks a pit peaky.

01:37.598 --> 01:39.683
Hey, Vedgers and Vedgettes.

01:40.267 --> 01:41.810
Welcome back to my channel.

01:41.810 --> 01:42.895
I am Mark Vedge.

01:42.895 --> 01:46.481
Today I am joined by a very special guest.

01:46.481 --> 01:47.566
No.

01:48.734 --> 01:51.987
His name's Russell.
Legally he's my stepdad,

01:51.987 --> 01:54.156
but to me, he's just Dad.

01:54.740 --> 01:56.491
And he's absolutely barmy!

01:58.160 --> 01:59.870
Hey, Veggie fans. How you diddling?

02:00.495 --> 02:02.873
"Diddling." I didn't know he was
gonna say that. He's off his rocker.

02:02.873 --> 02:04.750
- The pair of them.
- Yeah.

02:04.750 --> 02:06.210
Like a couple of kids.

02:06.210 --> 02:09.545
- They get on really well, don't they?
- Yeah. It's always been that way.

02:10.297 --> 02:11.548
When he was at junior school,

02:11.548 --> 02:13.926
Mark's teacher asked him
what he wanted to be when he grew up.

02:14.468 --> 02:15.677
What do you think he said?

02:17.471 --> 02:20.140
- Usain Bolt?
- A stepfather.

02:20.641 --> 02:23.435
Did he? What, at nine years old?

02:23.435 --> 02:24.645
I know.

02:26.480 --> 02:29.775
Today, we are unboxing
the Coleman Meadowood...

02:29.775 --> 02:32.277
- Yep.
- ...Air premier-- Could you give us a hand?

02:32.277 --> 02:33.904
- Air premier tent.
- That is heavy.

02:33.904 --> 02:38.784
Now, we will be erecting this guy later
and also reviewing the Sunshine--

02:38.784 --> 02:40.202
Up a little bit, babes.

02:40.869 --> 02:44.540
Sunshine 20-liter portable camping toilet.

02:44.540 --> 02:48.168
And spoiler alert it is a beauty.

02:48.168 --> 02:49.586
I cannot wait.

02:50.921 --> 02:53.173
We hit the jackpot, didn't we? Fella-wise.

02:53.173 --> 02:54.675
We're set to fire up, yeah?

02:54.675 --> 02:56.802
We're so alike, me and you.

03:00.013 --> 03:00.973
Are we?

03:02.224 --> 03:05.435
The way he dotes on Poppy.
Like he's her real father.

03:05.435 --> 03:06.979
Yeah, Poppy really loves him.

03:07.855 --> 03:09.481
I mean, he is really, isn't he?

03:11.608 --> 03:12.609
Isn't he?

03:12.609 --> 03:13.944
Yeah. Yeah.

03:17.823 --> 03:20.325
So lovely,
you and Mark inviting us along like this.

03:21.243 --> 03:22.411
Yeah. 'Course.

03:22.411 --> 03:25.080
When Mark was a boy,
we used to go camping in France.

03:26.623 --> 03:27.833
Gorgeous little place.

03:28.333 --> 03:29.835
Languedoc-Roussillon.

03:31.879 --> 03:33.130
Poppy would love it.

03:33.881 --> 03:36.300
You should suggest it. He'd be thrilled.

03:36.300 --> 03:39.052
Yeah. Maybe next year.

03:39.052 --> 03:42.347
Languedoc-Roussillon.
Yeah, go on. Try and say it.

03:47.352 --> 03:49.354
- Languedo--
- Languedoc.

03:50.022 --> 03:53.066
- Languedoc.
- No, no. Languedoc.

03:53.066 --> 03:54.568
I'm sure he's gonna know
what I mean though,

03:54.568 --> 03:56.111
- won't he?
- Oh, come on.

03:56.111 --> 03:58.197
If something's worth doing,
it's worth doing right.

03:58.197 --> 04:01.408
- We'll do it in stages, shall we? Yeah?
- Okay. Yeah. Yeah, let's do it.

04:01.992 --> 04:03.702
- Langue.
- Langue.

04:03.702 --> 04:06.038
No, listen. Langue.

04:06.038 --> 04:07.539
- Langue.
- That's it.

04:07.539 --> 04:09.541
Now then. Ngue.

04:09.541 --> 04:10.709
Ngue.

04:10.709 --> 04:14.046
- Ngue.
- Ngue.

04:14.046 --> 04:15.964
Listen, listen. Ngue. Ngue.

04:15.964 --> 04:18.591
- Ngue. Ngue.
- Ngue. Yes. Good.

04:18.591 --> 04:20.928
Now, doc. Doc.

04:20.928 --> 04:24.681
- Doc.
- See? I knew you had it in you.

04:24.681 --> 04:26.892
- Right, now then. Roussillon. Yeah.
- Do you know what?

04:26.892 --> 04:29.436
I'm just gonna take this
'cause I need to go for a wee.

04:29.937 --> 04:31.230
Nice one, babes.
We need someone to use that

04:31.230 --> 04:33.148
- so I can review it for my next video.
- No, babe.

04:33.148 --> 04:35.400
Come on. Just need a little bit of info.
Is it comfortable?

04:35.400 --> 04:37.528
- No, baby, stop it. No!
- Does it fill up too quick,

04:37.528 --> 04:39.404
- start touching your-- You know?
- Disgusting. No, Veggie.

04:39.947 --> 04:41.114
Good pumping.

04:54.962 --> 04:55.963
Who am I?

04:55.963 --> 04:57.840
<i>Oh, my God.
Were you actually asleep?</i>

05:00.092 --> 05:01.510
I wasn't sure if you'd answer.

05:01.510 --> 05:05.013
I thought you might still be
a little bit angry with me.

05:05.013 --> 05:06.098
Angry about what?

05:06.098 --> 05:09.059
Well, that I didn't, you know,
tell you about the Chloe thing.

05:09.685 --> 05:12.271
Oh, yeah. I forgot about that.

05:13.397 --> 05:15.440
I am sorry though.

05:15.440 --> 05:16.942
Yeah, I know. I know you are.

05:17.734 --> 05:18.777
<i>What time is it?</i>

05:19.278 --> 05:20.237
It's just gone 9:00.

05:20.237 --> 05:21.655
- At night?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

05:21.655 --> 05:24.449
- That's good. That means he's gone.
- <i>Who's gone?</i>

05:24.449 --> 05:26.910
<i>Builder. Landlord's finally
having the bathroom retiled.</i>

05:26.910 --> 05:30.956
So, I've had some guy around here called
Rick, Ralph, Ron something like that.

05:31.540 --> 05:34.126
<i>He turned up at 7:00 this morning.
It was horrible.</i>

05:34.126 --> 05:36.295
<i>You know I can't communicate
with actual men,</i>

05:36.295 --> 05:38.589
<i>especially ones
that know how to use tools.</i>

05:38.589 --> 05:40.257
Watch the match last night?

05:41.758 --> 05:44.428
Oh, yeah. Yeah, no, I wouldn't--
Yeah, I wouldn't miss it.

05:44.428 --> 05:47.514
Yeah. Arsenal played great, didn't they?

05:48.223 --> 05:50.559
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

05:50.559 --> 05:52.019
They're a lovely bunch of boys.

05:53.478 --> 05:55.105
I felt bad for Salah.

05:55.898 --> 05:58.025
- I know, right?
- I mean, you know, it was never offside.

05:58.025 --> 05:59.484
Offside? No.

05:59.484 --> 06:02.279
Yeah, he didn't touch the sides.
Didn't get anywhere near them.

06:04.114 --> 06:06.783
- You didn't watch the match, did you?
- No, I didn't. I'm sorry.

06:06.783 --> 06:08.827
Contact sport, it scares me, so...

06:11.455 --> 06:12.664
I just--

06:12.664 --> 06:14.374
<i>So, I did the only logical thing.</i>

06:15.292 --> 06:16.376
<i>I downed a bottle of cough syrup</i>

06:16.376 --> 06:17.920
<i>and knocked myself out
until he'd gone home.</i>

06:20.088 --> 06:22.174
Well, that's a bit of
a waste of a day, isn't it?

06:22.758 --> 06:25.469
<i>That's fair. Talking about
a waste of a day, how's camping going?</i>

06:25.469 --> 06:28.430
<i>I am having a great time.</i>

06:29.848 --> 06:31.141
How was that? Any way believable?

06:31.141 --> 06:32.684
Not remotely, no.

06:33.393 --> 06:35.270
If you don't like camping,
why'd you agree to go?

06:35.270 --> 06:36.730
<i>'Cause Veggie's into it.</i>

06:36.730 --> 06:38.732
I just thought it would be nice,
the three of us.

06:38.732 --> 06:40.400
Then Veggie invited his mum and dad.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.444
What's Veggie's mum and dad like?

06:43.153 --> 06:44.613
<i>Stepdad's nice. Interesting.</i>

06:44.613 --> 06:46.323
Yeah? And mum?

06:46.323 --> 06:48.033
Christine is lovely.

06:48.033 --> 06:50.077
<i>She is full of positivity.</i>

06:50.077 --> 06:52.871
She's just actually
a really, really nice person,

06:52.871 --> 06:54.456
and I bloody hate her guts.

06:56.500 --> 06:57.584
Does that make me a bad person?

06:57.584 --> 07:00.379
Look, I've told you before,
you're pure scum. People know this.

07:01.547 --> 07:02.798
- What was that?
- <i>What was what?</i>

07:08.095 --> 07:09.096
Sounds like feet.

07:11.932 --> 07:14.685
- Oh, my God. It's like in that film.
- That doesn't narrow it down.

07:15.936 --> 07:18.772
Hello? Hello? Is somebody there?

07:21.733 --> 07:24.194
- What is it?
- <i>Dunno, I can't see anything.</i>

07:25.779 --> 07:27.114
- <i>Oh, my God!</i>
- What?

07:27.114 --> 07:29.408
<i>Oh, my God, there's a big bunch of cows.</i>

07:32.870 --> 07:33.704
Cows?

07:35.706 --> 07:36.915
Do cows attack?

07:36.915 --> 07:38.000
<i>No, of course not.</i>

07:38.625 --> 07:41.003
Actually, I don't know.
Hang on, bear with me. Let me check.

07:41.003 --> 07:44.339
<i>"Do cows attack?" Okay.</i>

07:44.339 --> 07:46.717
Yeah, they do attack.
And they do-- And they kill.

07:46.717 --> 07:47.801
What?

07:50.262 --> 07:52.431
<i>Danny? Danny!</i>

07:54.099 --> 07:55.309
<i>Danny!</i>

07:55.309 --> 07:57.603
- <i>I'm gonna have to call you back.</i>
- No, no, you can't go!

07:57.603 --> 07:59.229
<i>No, Danny, this is actually terrify--</i>

08:01.815 --> 08:02.858
Hello.

08:20.751 --> 08:25.672
<i>Once upon a time
I was falling in love</i>

08:25.672 --> 08:29.051
<i>Now I'm only falling apart</i>

08:29.551 --> 08:36.099
<i>Nothing I can do
A total eclipse of the heart</i>

08:36.099 --> 08:38.352
- Hello?
- All right, mate?

08:39.269 --> 08:40.604
You still here then?

08:40.604 --> 08:43.273
Yeah, I thought I'd keep going, you know?

08:43.273 --> 08:47.444
Try and get it all done in one go if--
Unless, like, that's a problem.

08:47.444 --> 08:48.695
Well, actually, I just--

08:48.695 --> 08:50.572
Yeah, no, lovely tiles.

08:51.573 --> 08:52.866
I got the same ones in my bathroom.

08:53.992 --> 08:54.993
Me other half picked 'em.

08:56.912 --> 08:58.288
Always has great taste.

09:00.541 --> 09:02.918
Anyway, I shouldn't be much longer.

09:03.585 --> 09:04.586
Good.

09:10.509 --> 09:12.135
Would you like a cup of tea?

09:12.135 --> 09:13.929
Yeah. Lovely, thank you.

09:19.893 --> 09:20.936
Hi, Mr. Cow.

09:20.936 --> 09:22.104
Leese?

09:23.063 --> 09:25.732
- You okay?
- Fine.

09:25.732 --> 09:26.942
So, who you avoiding?

09:26.942 --> 09:29.278
No one, you loon. I just wanted a moment.

09:29.278 --> 09:30.362
With the cows?

09:30.988 --> 09:31.989
Yeah.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.033
Yeah, the cows just turned up.

09:36.159 --> 09:38.370
Much like everyone else this weekend.

09:38.370 --> 09:42.666
Oh, Leese, I'm sorry. I didn't even think.

09:42.666 --> 09:44.626
It's not a problem,
them being here, is it?

09:44.626 --> 09:46.545
I can't really ask them to leave.

09:46.545 --> 09:48.297
No, course it's not a problem.

09:48.881 --> 09:50.090
I love Russell.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.592
And Christine.

09:51.592 --> 09:55.470
I just thought we were gonna
have some quality time together.

09:55.470 --> 09:59.183
We still can. How about I book a table
at that nice pub we passed earlier?

09:59.183 --> 10:00.851
For tomorrow night. Just the three of us.

10:00.851 --> 10:01.977
- Really?
- Yeah, course.

10:01.977 --> 10:03.645
Mum and Dad won't mind
sitting at another table.

10:04.730 --> 10:06.940
Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Sounds like a plan.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.483
Great. Should we head back?

10:08.483 --> 10:11.028
Yeah, let's head back. Yeah.

10:13.906 --> 10:15.490
You know, I have to say,

10:15.490 --> 10:19.328
seeing you in this anorak,
carrying a portable toilet...

10:19.328 --> 10:22.706
- Shut up.
- ...you have never looked sexier.

10:22.706 --> 10:23.624
Fuck!

10:28.003 --> 10:30.714
Oh, dear. You hurt your leg?

10:30.714 --> 10:33.550
Yeah, ankle. Sprained it.

10:34.134 --> 10:36.428
- Sprained? That ankle there?
- Yeah.

10:36.428 --> 10:38.597
- No, you haven't.
- What?

10:38.597 --> 10:41.016
Trust a trained physiotherapist.

10:41.016 --> 10:43.685
Pulled? Could be. Bruised? Maybe.

10:43.685 --> 10:47.231
Sprained? No.
You'd know if you'd sprained your ankle.

10:47.231 --> 10:50.442
Well, I know. I've sprained my ankle.

10:50.442 --> 10:51.860
No, you'd know.

10:52.778 --> 10:55.614
Yeah. And I know I've sprained it.

10:55.614 --> 10:58.116
No, I mean, you'd know.

10:58.909 --> 11:01.787
- And I know I have.
- Okay.

11:03.163 --> 11:04.831
- But you'd know.
- How about we turn in?

11:05.541 --> 11:07.334
- Yep?
- Yeah. Okay.

11:07.334 --> 11:08.502
Night, Mum.

11:32.776 --> 11:34.444
Those cows could've killed me.

11:34.444 --> 11:35.737
He's still here.

11:35.737 --> 11:36.947
<i>What? Who's still there?</i>

11:36.947 --> 11:39.700
Rick. Or Ralph.
Or whatever his name is. The builder.

11:39.700 --> 11:41.743
- He's still there?
- Yeah, it's weird, isn't it?

11:41.743 --> 11:43.161
Danny, that is so weird.

11:43.161 --> 11:45.497
What do I do? I can't drink
another bottle of cough syrup.

11:45.497 --> 11:46.665
I've run out.

11:47.165 --> 11:50.002
- <i>Well, what was that?</i>
- I don't know. I'll call you back.

11:54.381 --> 11:55.465
Hello.

11:56.758 --> 12:00.345
I'm sorry.
It just slipped out of me hand.

12:00.345 --> 12:02.055
Well, it's fine. It's just a tile.

12:02.055 --> 12:06.435
No, it's not just a tile.
It's more than that!

12:07.853 --> 12:10.230
I'm sorry.
I don't know where that came from.

12:12.858 --> 12:15.027
Yeah,
so I've done most of the grouting now.

12:15.027 --> 12:18.530
And it's just drying, so--

12:19.740 --> 12:21.867
No, I said I wouldn't do this.

12:23.035 --> 12:24.077
I'm not gonna do this.

12:24.077 --> 12:28.081
Yeah. Please don't do this.
Don't cry, builder.

12:28.081 --> 12:29.416
I'm sorry. It's just,

12:30.083 --> 12:32.669
me and my husband, Chris,
we've had a terrible row.

12:34.463 --> 12:37.049
He wants me to fit into his little mold.

12:38.008 --> 12:40.427
But I won't do it. I won't do it, Danny.

12:41.011 --> 12:41.970
Yeah, don't.

12:41.970 --> 12:46.141
So I like the football.
Does that make me unsophisticated?

12:48.519 --> 12:50.437
- No. No, exactly.
- No. No.

12:51.063 --> 12:52.981
I mean, I like the opera
as much as the next man.

12:52.981 --> 12:55.359
All I said was
the tickets were a bit pricey.

12:55.359 --> 12:57.152
Does that make me a Philistine?

12:57.778 --> 12:59.571
- No, it doesn't!
- No. No, it doesn't.

12:59.571 --> 13:02.199
And if you're gonna get
a set of patio chairs,

13:02.199 --> 13:03.867
why do they have to be wicker?

13:05.536 --> 13:07.746
Plastic's not gonna rot, is it?

13:08.747 --> 13:10.916
- No, it's not.
- No, it's not.

13:11.667 --> 13:14.044
He called me a cultural caveman.

13:15.796 --> 13:16.839
Can you believe that?

13:16.839 --> 13:19.424
I can't believe anything that's happening
right now, to be honest.

13:19.424 --> 13:21.218
Well, I'm not going home to him tonight.

13:22.845 --> 13:24.930
Not after the cruel things he said to me.

13:32.104 --> 13:33.230
He's staying the night?

13:33.230 --> 13:35.232
Yeah, well, I couldn't let him kip
in the van, could I?

13:35.232 --> 13:37.609
- <i>Well, where is he now?</i>
- He's having a little nap.

13:38.485 --> 13:41.613
I think all the tiling and
the crying have taken it out of him.

13:44.116 --> 13:46.034
- I'll call you back.
- Okay.

13:46.034 --> 13:47.327
Can't sleep?

13:49.079 --> 13:51.665
- Me neither.
- Yeah. Just came out for some fresh air.

13:53.041 --> 13:54.251
How's the ankle?

13:56.003 --> 13:57.337
Still sprained.

13:58.005 --> 13:59.006
Okay.

14:02.259 --> 14:03.468
Room for a small one?

14:07.472 --> 14:09.850
Just gonna go and drain the weasel.

14:13.187 --> 14:14.813
Isn't love amazing?

14:15.647 --> 14:19.359
Do you know, I haven't spent one day
away from that man since the day we met.

14:19.359 --> 14:21.862
He even held my hand
throughout my hysterectomy.

14:22.613 --> 14:24.448
As soon as I'd joined
the same firm as him,

14:24.448 --> 14:26.158
I thought, "Yes, please."

14:26.867 --> 14:31.747
Went home, wrote on a piece of paper,
"I will marry Russell."

14:31.747 --> 14:32.873
Stuck it on the wall.

14:33.457 --> 14:36.376
See, when you put what you want
out into the universe,

14:37.252 --> 14:38.712
the universe answers.

14:40.005 --> 14:41.548
That's a lovely way to think.

14:42.424 --> 14:45.719
And you'd think after all these years
of marriage, the S-E-X would suffer.

14:45.719 --> 14:46.803
Oh, God.

14:48.555 --> 14:49.598
- No?
- No.

14:51.934 --> 14:53.477
- No.
- No?

14:54.645 --> 14:56.063
No, it's liberating.

14:56.063 --> 14:57.147
When you trust someone,

14:57.814 --> 14:59.024
you can experiment.

14:59.942 --> 15:01.610
You can go full taboo.

15:03.737 --> 15:05.572
Where's Russell got to?

15:05.572 --> 15:08.700
- Party going on without me?
- Please join. Hiya.

15:08.700 --> 15:11.328
Russell's weasel has been drained.

15:12.871 --> 15:15.290
Look at all of us
burning the midnight oil.

15:16.375 --> 15:17.501
You know what we should do?

15:18.001 --> 15:19.878
- We should play...
- Oh, no.

15:19.878 --> 15:22.089
Veggie-Veggie-Bing-Bong!

15:22.089 --> 15:23.924
- Yes!
- Yeah?

15:24.466 --> 15:27.261
- Yeah.
- Yes! Come on!

15:28.011 --> 15:29.513
<i>What's a Veggie-Veggie-Bing-Bong?</i>

15:29.513 --> 15:31.723
It's the family game they invented.

15:31.723 --> 15:33.892
- <i>And what are the rules?</i>
- I don't know.

15:33.892 --> 15:36.019
They've explained them to me,
like, a million times,

15:36.019 --> 15:37.729
and they just do not make sense.

15:37.729 --> 15:38.814
Explain them to me.

15:38.814 --> 15:41.441
Okay. Here's what I can work out.

15:41.441 --> 15:43.277
Eat the ham!

15:43.277 --> 15:44.695
<i>There's ham involved.</i>

15:44.695 --> 15:46.113
That's all you've got? Ham?

15:46.113 --> 15:49.449
Yeah. They throw ham.
I don't know why. They just do.

15:49.449 --> 15:50.742
Well, there must be a reason.

15:51.869 --> 15:52.703
Rich?

15:52.703 --> 15:53.620
<i>Who's that?</i>

15:53.620 --> 15:56.206
Rich, it's Chris. I just wanna talk.

15:56.206 --> 15:59.042
- Oi, wait, what's going on?
- Rich, please.

16:01.336 --> 16:02.796
- Rich, who?
- Good one.

16:02.796 --> 16:04.047
Rich, I know you're in there.

16:04.923 --> 16:05.966
How'd you know he's in here?

16:05.966 --> 16:07.551
Yeah, how'd you know I'm in here?

16:07.551 --> 16:11.013
I pinged the GPS on your phone,
and your van's parked outside.

16:11.013 --> 16:12.389
Also, you just spoke.

16:12.389 --> 16:15.017
This is ridiculous. Just let me in.

16:16.059 --> 16:17.102
What do I do?

16:20.397 --> 16:22.441
- What does he do?
- He talks to him.

16:22.441 --> 16:24.234
He's in pain. Can't you hear?

16:24.234 --> 16:26.445
This pain. You need to get--

16:26.445 --> 16:28.113
You guys need to talk and stuff.

16:28.113 --> 16:32.659
Just give me a moment!
I'm gonna put some clothes on.

16:34.036 --> 16:37.080
Danny, I've gotta go.
They're setting up this bloody game.

16:37.080 --> 16:41.084
Oh, yeah. Leave me in the middle of
some kind of <i>Love Island</i> therapy session.

16:43.545 --> 16:44.505
- Hi.
- Hi.

16:44.505 --> 16:45.506
Danny.

16:45.506 --> 16:47.216
Right, so you're hiding from me now?

16:47.216 --> 16:49.885
Perhaps you guys wanna be left
in private? Yeah.

16:49.885 --> 16:51.094
I don't want to hear it.

16:53.013 --> 16:55.265
Veg.

16:55.265 --> 16:57.017
You have to help me win this game.

16:57.017 --> 16:59.394
We can form an alliance.
We can help each other.

17:00.145 --> 17:02.481
Lisa, that's cheating.
You know I can't do that.

17:02.481 --> 17:03.815
It goes against every clause

17:03.815 --> 17:05.901
- of the Vedge Family code.
- Veggie.

17:06.609 --> 17:07.778
Sorry.

17:07.778 --> 17:09.905
At least don't throw the ham so hard
this time.

17:09.905 --> 17:10.989
I'll try.

17:12.950 --> 17:14.076
Listen to this.

17:14.076 --> 17:15.953
- <i>The Marriage of Figaro</i>, I went to.
- Yes.

17:15.953 --> 17:17.412
- <i>The Magic Flute.</i>
- Yes.

17:17.412 --> 17:18.829
<i>Did I enjoy them? No.</i>

17:18.829 --> 17:21.333
<i>Every time I think they're
winding down, they end up getting louder.</i>

17:21.333 --> 17:24.377
- <i>Anyway, how's your game going?</i>
- It hasn't started yet.

17:24.377 --> 17:27.047
Danny, I hate this game. I always lose.

17:30.801 --> 17:31.927
Maybe you can help me.

17:32.553 --> 17:34.555
- Wait. How?
- Yeah, that's it.

17:34.555 --> 17:36.807
Veggie-Veggie-Bing-Bong.
You're gonna help me win it.

17:36.807 --> 17:39.226
I don't know if I can, Leese.
I got a couple of fellas in love in here.

17:39.226 --> 17:40.435
Please, please, Danny.

17:40.435 --> 17:43.230
Christine always beats me.
I just have to beat her, just once.

17:43.230 --> 17:44.314
Please help me.

17:44.898 --> 17:47.860
Okay, fine. But after this,
I'm through with helping people, okay?

17:47.860 --> 17:49.820
Okay. Stay on the line.
Stay on the line. Okay.

17:51.697 --> 17:54.116
You all right? Need a hand setting up?

17:55.742 --> 17:57.828
Okay. T. rex arms in.

17:57.828 --> 17:59.288
Raptor eggs greased.

17:59.288 --> 18:01.999
Dino mountain constructed.

18:01.999 --> 18:06.920
All right, come on, Vedges. Let's go!
Here we go!

18:07.796 --> 18:09.173
Hey, lift me up a bit.

18:11.300 --> 18:12.801
- Is that better?
- Yeah, that's great.

18:12.801 --> 18:14.595
Ready? Steady?

18:15.220 --> 18:18.390
- Go. Dinosaur Dump Trucks!
- Yeah!

18:18.390 --> 18:20.684
Go, go, go.

18:20.684 --> 18:21.977
Go on, you can do it.

18:23.896 --> 18:25.856
- Yeah!
- Veggie-Veggie!

18:25.856 --> 18:26.940
Bing-bong!

18:27.524 --> 18:29.902
God, it's like the SEAL footage
of them capturing Osama Bin Laden.

18:29.902 --> 18:31.236
<i>Here she comes!</i>

18:31.236 --> 18:32.821
Only, you know, a lot more different.

18:34.156 --> 18:35.574
<i>What kind of melon is that?</i>

18:35.574 --> 18:37.993
- Honeydew.
- What's it covered in?

18:37.993 --> 18:39.161
I don't know.

18:39.161 --> 18:40.579
It's salad cream, I think.

18:40.579 --> 18:41.997
You can do it!

18:41.997 --> 18:44.666
They must've brought that on the chance
they'd play Dinosaur Dump Trucks.

18:44.666 --> 18:47.419
- Yeah! Bing-bong!
- Yes. Go.

18:47.419 --> 18:48.837
Yes. You got it.

18:53.050 --> 18:53.884
That's a shame, innit?

18:53.884 --> 18:56.470
Eat the ham. Eat the ham.

18:56.470 --> 18:59.973
- Yeah. Eat the ham. Eat the ham.
- Yeah!

18:59.973 --> 19:02.726
And she did so well on her bruised ankle.

19:02.726 --> 19:04.144
It's sprained.

19:04.144 --> 19:06.146
Right, quiz time.

19:07.272 --> 19:09.525
I gotta say, this game is pretty good.

19:12.152 --> 19:15.113
Right, so, who directed <i>Avatar</i>?

19:15.113 --> 19:18.116
I know this one. James Cameron.

19:18.116 --> 19:20.369
- No, it was the Berlin Wall.
- <i>What?</i>

19:20.369 --> 19:23.497
- Wrong answer!
- Sorry.

19:24.331 --> 19:25.332
How?

19:25.332 --> 19:28.293
Well, from what I can see,
Russell has his thumb on his eyebrow

19:28.293 --> 19:29.586
and two fingers in his pocket.

19:29.586 --> 19:32.297
That means
it's the "three questions ago" rule.

19:32.297 --> 19:35.008
Three questions ago,
the answer was the Berlin Wall.

19:35.843 --> 19:37.261
Eat the ham!

19:39.471 --> 19:41.765
I'm gonna eat the whole pig tonight.

19:43.016 --> 19:46.061
Look, I know Christine is in the lead,
but I don't know how.

19:46.061 --> 19:47.729
Because she was the Bobbywallet
the last round.

19:47.729 --> 19:49.356
Rounds? Wha-- The--

19:49.356 --> 19:51.108
- There are rounds?
- Yeah, there's 17 rounds.

19:51.108 --> 19:52.109
It's a bloody good game.

19:52.109 --> 19:53.986
<i>What do you mean, 17? How do you know?</i>

19:53.986 --> 19:56.238
Are you okay? Hiya, Danny.

19:56.238 --> 19:57.531
Hey, Veg.

19:57.531 --> 19:58.866
I'll see you later.

19:58.866 --> 20:00.868
I can ask them to stop throwing ham,
if you like.

20:00.868 --> 20:03.787
- I could say you've gone vegetarian.
- What, in the last five minutes?

20:03.787 --> 20:04.705
Fair point.

20:04.705 --> 20:08.000
I could always take your ham for you.
Yeah? Let me be your ham proxy.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.210
- My ham proxy?
- Yeah, yeah. I don't mind.

20:10.210 --> 20:11.962
Extra protein, innit?

20:13.130 --> 20:14.298
Thanks, Veg.

20:17.259 --> 20:19.303
No, don't. No, don't tickle.

20:19.303 --> 20:23.765
- Veggie!
- All right then, Vedges, halftime is up.

20:23.765 --> 20:25.267
Game on!

20:25.267 --> 20:30.439
I appreciate you
and who you are in this moment

20:30.439 --> 20:32.983
and all our moments moving forwards.

20:33.692 --> 20:34.985
- Come here.
- Stop it.

20:46.955 --> 20:49.583
- There he is. Our little savior.
- Yeah.

20:49.583 --> 20:51.752
No. So-- I'm just--
I'm glad you guys made up.

20:51.752 --> 20:53.587
- Yeah. I can't even remember...
- Yeah.

20:53.587 --> 20:55.005
...what we were fighting about.

20:55.506 --> 20:58.550
I'm gonna get him a season ticket,
so he can come to the football with me.

20:58.550 --> 21:01.386
- Ain't I?
- Yeah. TBD.

21:01.386 --> 21:04.640
- Yeah. Sorry. Yeah. TBD.
- TBD.

21:05.849 --> 21:08.101
We were gonna have a little drink,
you know?

21:08.101 --> 21:09.811
- It's been a hell of a day.
- Oh, my God.

21:10.395 --> 21:11.480
Okay, great.

21:15.526 --> 21:16.610
Do you have any amaretto?

21:17.194 --> 21:23.367
Now, Lisa, tell me,
who ate the pear in the witch's garden?

21:26.828 --> 21:28.330
- I don't know.
- No, you do.

21:28.330 --> 21:30.290
- It's obviously Christine.
- I thought it was Veggie.

21:30.290 --> 21:32.292
No, he was the Onion Baby.

21:32.292 --> 21:34.211
Oh, my Gods, why am I lying?

21:34.211 --> 21:36.672
Yeah. It's Christine. Say Christine.

21:38.298 --> 21:39.132
Christine?

21:39.132 --> 21:40.759
- Correct!
- Correct!

21:42.094 --> 21:43.929
Wow! Nice one.

21:43.929 --> 21:45.097
Right.

21:45.097 --> 21:49.268
Christine and Lisa are tied
in first place.

21:50.060 --> 21:51.562
So we have a tiebreaker.

21:51.562 --> 21:52.771
Here we go.

21:55.315 --> 22:01.071
To win, who won the Second World War?

22:01.071 --> 22:02.531
- Kings of Leon!
- Did they?

22:02.531 --> 22:05.284
Well, I don't know, but they did release
some bloody good albums.

22:05.284 --> 22:07.452
- That's true.
- Wait look. Look at Russell.

22:07.452 --> 22:09.830
It's the "three question ago" answer rule.
She's won.

22:09.830 --> 22:11.039
Correct!

22:13.292 --> 22:14.376
Yay!

22:14.376 --> 22:16.837
- You did it. You're brilliant.
- She did it.

22:16.837 --> 22:18.005
And you didn't need any help.

22:19.381 --> 22:20.215
Thanks, Veggie.

22:23.427 --> 22:25.762
So good! Yes!

22:29.141 --> 22:31.310
- Oh, my God. Well done!
- She did it.

22:31.310 --> 22:34.479
- Yeah. Well done, you.
- Good for you! Yeah!

22:39.568 --> 22:43.030
Who's the lord in the bin?
Who's the lord in the bin?

22:43.947 --> 22:46.074
All right, this bit makes no sense.
I thought the game was over.

22:46.825 --> 22:48.785
- Closing ceremony.
- Of course it is.

22:55.501 --> 22:56.502
We're leaving.

22:57.753 --> 23:00.964
I don't think you get
how big a deal this is for me, Danny.

23:00.964 --> 23:02.591
This is gonna go on my CV.

23:02.591 --> 23:03.967
You do remember you cheated?

23:03.967 --> 23:05.552
<i>Yeah, but not for the last question.</i>

23:05.552 --> 23:08.347
<i>I suppose not. Well done on spotting
the "three questions ago" rule.</i>

23:08.347 --> 23:11.642
- <i>That's good.</i>
- See? I do listen to you sometimes.

23:12.309 --> 23:13.644
I won!

23:14.937 --> 23:18.273
- I won. I won. I won. I won.
- You won. You won.

23:21.693 --> 23:24.696
- <i>Look, I should probably let you go.</i>
- Okay. Night night.

23:24.696 --> 23:25.781
Night, champ.

23:27.699 --> 23:29.034
Bye.

23:31.411 --> 23:34.581
- What a win.
- Thanks.

23:36.667 --> 23:39.211
I hope you're gonna pass the game
down to Poppy.

23:40.128 --> 23:42.005
And yours and Marky's kids,

23:42.506 --> 23:43.590
when the time comes.

23:44.925 --> 23:47.386
Which looks like it's gonna be
sooner rather than later.

23:49.805 --> 23:51.014
What?

23:51.723 --> 23:54.351
I mean, any day now.

23:55.018 --> 23:56.520
Any day now, what?

23:57.271 --> 23:58.313
Till it happens.

23:59.022 --> 24:00.148
Till what happens?

24:01.692 --> 24:03.819
Till someone proposes.

24:06.905 --> 24:08.615
What are my two favorite girls
talking about then?

24:09.491 --> 24:10.325
Nothing.

24:10.993 --> 24:13.495
Right, then.
I'll see you both in the morning.

24:13.495 --> 24:14.955
- Okay.
- Night.

24:14.955 --> 24:16.039
Night.

24:18.250 --> 24:20.169
I think I'm gonna turn in. You?

24:20.169 --> 24:22.087
Yeah, yeah. I'll be there in a sec.

24:23.255 --> 24:26.133
Great. Okay.

24:39.855 --> 24:42.524
Good. Your ankle's better.

24:43.901 --> 24:45.235
Yeah.
