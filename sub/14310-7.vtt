the night, never to meet again.

13:02.139 --> 13:05.039
[blows party horn]

13:05.059 --> 13:07.080
(Papa Smurf)
'Keep your smurfs crossed.'

13:08.230 --> 13:11.029
[chimes]

13:19.200 --> 13:22.210
Whee! Woo-woo!
Ha, ha! Wocka, wocka!

13:22.230 --> 13:25.210
Oh, smurf. Nothing works.

13:25.230 --> 13:28.039
[sighs]
This is awful.

13:28.059 --> 13:31.049
And it all started so suddenly.

13:31.070 --> 13:35.049
[gasps]
Why, it all started
when I found this locket.

13:35.070 --> 13:37.220
Maybe, maybe it's bad luck.

13:39.149 --> 13:41.120
I-I'd better get rid of it.

13:41.139 --> 13:43.230
Maybe good luck will return.

13:45.120 --> 13:48.159
We're lost again,
aren't we, Garglesmell?

13:48.179 --> 13:50.129
Of course not.

13:50.149 --> 13:52.139
We started here,
then we went here

13:52.159 --> 13:55.179
then we just left
here and now..

13:55.200 --> 13:59.029
- And now?
- We're lost.

14:00.190 --> 14:02.139
Isn't there anyone we could ask?

14:02.159 --> 14:04.090
A friend of the Smurfs, perhaps?

14:04.110 --> 14:07.080
No. Their only friends
are disgusting

14:07.100 --> 14:10.100
things like butterflies
and bunnies and--

14:10.120 --> 14:13.139
That gives me a marvelous idea.

14:13.159 --> 14:18.090
You can go. I'll handle
this myself now, thank you.

14:18.110 --> 14:21.059
W-what?
But-but what about our deal?

14:21.080 --> 14:24.159
Begone or I'll vanish you
into thin air.

14:24.179 --> 14:26.049
[yowls]

14:26.070 --> 14:30.080
Now, I have just enough power
left for one last spell.

14:30.100 --> 14:32.100
The perfect spell.

14:32.120 --> 14:33.220
[laughs]

14:36.210 --> 14:39.200
Goodbye, lovely locket.

14:40.190 --> 14:42.149
Why me, Azrael?

14:42.169 --> 14:46.120
All I ask is a chance to spread
a little evil in the world

14:46.139 --> 14:48.059
and what do I get?

14:48.080 --> 14:49.230
[gasps]

14:50.009 --> 14:51.230
Hogatha's locket.

14:52.009 --> 14:55.029
Now, it belongs to me.

14:55.049 --> 14:56.210
[humming]

15:00.090 --> 15:01.179
Oh, me, oh, my.

15:01.200 --> 15:05.179
If someone doesn't save me soon,
I'm just going to croak.

15:05.200 --> 15:08.190
A-a frog that talks.

15:08.210 --> 15:11.200
I'm no frog, dearie.
I'm a beautiful princess.

15:11.220 --> 15:15.029
At least...I was.

15:15.049 --> 15:17.179
[sobbing]

15:17.200 --> 15:20.000
A wicked old witch
put a spell on me...

15:20.019 --> 15:24.110
...and only the kiss of
a handsome Smurf can save me.

15:24.129 --> 15:30.039
Oh, I-I guess that leaves
me out. I'm a Smurfette.

15:30.059 --> 15:31.200
[sobbing]

15:33.210 --> 15:37.139
But follow me. I'll take you
to a whole bunch of Smurfs.

15:37.159 --> 15:39.220
Oh, how sweet.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.169
I thought you'd never ask.

15:44.139 --> 15:47.179
I'll try once more
to smurf a cure for this spell.

15:47.200 --> 15:49.200
But it will take all
my concentration

15:49.220 --> 15:53.139
so do not disturb me
under any conditions.

15:58.049 --> 16:03.230
Ahem! Smurfs, we are in
the presence of royalty.

16:04.009 --> 16:05.049
Royalty?

16:05.070 --> 16:07.210
[indistinct chatter]

16:07.230 --> 16:12.169
This frog is really a beautiful
princess under a witch's spell.

16:12.190 --> 16:16.049
'Only a kiss from
a Smurf can save her.'

16:16.070 --> 16:18.080
'So who will be first?'

16:18.100 --> 16:21.009
- Uh-uh. No.
- Not me. No.

16:21.029 --> 16:23.090
Go ahead, Vanity,
you're the closest.

16:23.110 --> 16:25.059
Uh, I'd love to, but I, uh..

16:25.080 --> 16:27.220
[coughs]
I have a little cold.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.179
- But Harmony will do it.
- Not me.

16:30.200 --> 16:33.129
Like, I have to
save my lips. Ha-ha-ha.

16:33.149 --> 16:37.059
But Brainy's mouth is always
moving, let him do it.

16:37.080 --> 16:40.000
Wait. Haste makes waste.

16:40.019 --> 16:43.049
Look before you lip,
or leap and--

16:43.070 --> 16:45.059
Forget it.
You'd bore her to death.

16:45.080 --> 16:49.100
Hiya, doll. It's party time.

16:49.120 --> 16:51.070
[blows party horn]

16:51.090 --> 16:54.029
Say-y-y, what a dynamite frog.

16:54.049 --> 16:56.100
'You come here often?
What's your sign?'

16:56.120 --> 17:02.070
Grouchy, just one kiss will turn
this frog into a princess.

17:02.090 --> 17:04.108
Well, why didn't you say so?

17:05.200 --> 17:07.210
Pucker up, princess.

17:07.230 --> 17:10.089
Wow! What a Smurf.

17:11.039 --> 17:12.039
mwah mwah

17:12.059 --> 17:14.079
mwah mwah mwah

17:14.098 --> 17:17.108
Now we have that miserable witch
right where we want her.

17:17.130 --> 17:19.019
[laughs]

17:19.039 --> 17:20.079
[laughs]

17:20.098 --> 17:22.059
What more could
a wizard wish for

17:22.079 --> 17:26.059
except maybe all
the Smurfs on a silver platter.

17:26.079 --> 17:28.019
[laughs]

17:28.039 --> 17:29.089
zap zap

17:32.009 --> 17:33.140
whoosh

17:40.180 --> 17:42.039
What in the..

17:43.210 --> 17:46.130
(Smurfs)
'Huh. Gargamel!'

17:46.150 --> 17:49.009
Incredible.

17:49.029 --> 17:51.029
[meowing]

17:51.049 --> 17:55.190
[laughs]
All my dreams have
finally come true.

17:57.109 --> 18:00.000
Don't be bashful.
Kiss me, you fool.

18:00.019 --> 18:01.099
mwah mwah

18:02.190 --> 18:04.089
Oh! They're gone.

18:04.109 --> 18:06.210
This is terrible,
I've got to kiss a Smurf

18:06.230 --> 18:09.210
or I'll be stuck
like this forever.

18:09.230 --> 18:13.069
Help! Garglesmell!

18:18.029 --> 18:19.200
[humming]

18:19.220 --> 18:23.200
There. And now for
the biggest decision of my life.

18:23.220 --> 18:27.049
What to do with you.
Ha-ha-ha!

18:27.069 --> 18:28.099
[laughs]

18:29.180 --> 18:32.049
- Let's see. I could salt a few.
- Yeah.

18:32.069 --> 18:33.119
- Pickle a few.
- Yeah.

18:33.140 --> 18:35.069
- French-fry a few.
- Yeah.

18:35.089 --> 18:40.079
Or I could put them all
together in one big stew.

18:40.099 --> 18:42.160
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

18:42.180 --> 18:45.119
- Greedy.
- Oh, yeah.

18:45.140 --> 18:49.170
Smurfs, our only hope for
escape is dangling on that hook.

18:49.190 --> 18:53.039
First, we need a piece
of that string for a lasso.

18:53.059 --> 18:55.029
[Azrael meows]

18:55.049 --> 18:58.170
But we can do nothing
with Azrael watching us.

18:58.190 --> 19:01.170
Maybe we can turn
a curse into a blessing. Listen.

19:01.190 --> 19:03.009
[whispers]

19:03.029 --> 19:04.109

19:05.220 --> 19:06.220

19:07.000 --> 19:09.079

'Wocka, wocka!'

19:09.099 --> 19:12.170
Wocka, wocka. Wocka, wocka.

19:12.190 --> 19:14.039
[shivers]

19:14.059 --> 19:16.049
Okay, boost us up.

19:17.230 --> 19:20.019
Jokey. Here it comes.

19:21.130 --> 19:24.019
(Smurfs)
'Hurray! We did it!'

19:24.039 --> 19:26.150
Yoo-hoo, Garglesmell.

19:26.170 --> 19:28.210
It's your old friend, Hogatha.

19:28.230 --> 19:31.210
I-I-I've reconsidered
and just possibly

19:31.230 --> 19:34.099
could use your help, dear.

19:34.119 --> 19:39.140
Forget it. I already have
the Smurfs and your locket.

19:39.160 --> 19:41.049
[laughs]

19:41.069 --> 19:44.130
Oh, quick, Smurfs, kiss me.
Break the spell.

19:44.150 --> 19:45.180
[grunts]

19:47.190 --> 19:51.009
And stay out, or I'll turn
you into frogs' legs.

19:53.039 --> 19:58.059
Now, we have
a stew to do, eh, Azrael?

19:58.079 --> 19:59.200

there's no time to lose.'

Oh, smurf.

20:06.200 --> 20:08.049
[Smurfs gasp]

20:08.069 --> 20:13.130
I'm so glad you could all
make it for dinner.

20:13.150 --> 20:16.049
It won't be long now.

20:16.069 --> 20:18.079
[laughs]

20:18.099 --> 20:21.029
I don't know if
I can reach it from here.

20:21.049 --> 20:24.029
Smurf it for all you're worth.

20:24.049 --> 20:25.230
(Hefty)
'I've got it. I've got it.'

20:26.009 --> 20:29.039
(Papa Smurf)
'Good work, Hefty. Hurry.'

'Oh, we've got to hurry.'

20:39.079 --> 20:41.069
click

20:41.089 --> 20:44.039
- Quickly, run.
- Wait, Smurfs, wait.

20:44.059 --> 20:46.160
Don't go until you've kissed me.

20:46.180 --> 20:50.119
What? Stop, you rotten
little snakes.

20:50.140 --> 20:53.049
[instrumental music]

20:58.019 --> 20:59.130
(Gargamel)
'Whoa!'

20:59.150 --> 21:00.230
thud

21:02.140 --> 21:04.150
Oh! My locket.

21:07.200 --> 21:08.230
It's mine again.

21:09.009 --> 21:11.069
My Smurfs, they're all escaping.

21:11.089 --> 21:16.039
Who cares? I have no
use for any of them.

21:16.059 --> 21:19.019
- Except this one.
- Help.

21:19.039 --> 21:22.029
I need a serving girl
and you'll do fine.

21:22.049 --> 21:25.059
Oh, you're a little small,
but you can work twice as hard.

21:25.079 --> 21:28.039
Or three times as hard,
or ten times.

21:28.059 --> 21:29.220
[snorts and laughs]

21:31.079 --> 21:33.049
We can't leave
without Smurfette.

21:33.069 --> 21:37.009
- I-I won't do it.
- You have no choice, dearie.

21:37.029 --> 21:39.099
Oh, yes, I do.

21:39.119 --> 21:42.049
- Hey.
- Papa Smurf.

21:43.099 --> 21:46.150
Now the locket's
power belongs to us.

21:46.170 --> 21:48.049
[all cheer]

21:48.069 --> 21:51.130
No. No one shall ever use
these powers again.

21:51.150 --> 21:53.170
All they cause is trouble.

21:54.200 --> 21:56.140
[explosion]

22:01.170 --> 22:03.210
We-we're cured.

[laughs]

22:06.059 --> 22:08.180
Good. I hate wocka, wockas.

22:10.009 --> 22:12.119
You fools. What have you done?

22:12.140 --> 22:16.210
When the locket
is destroyed, so am I!

22:16.230 --> 22:19.049
[coughing]

22:21.049 --> 22:24.079
Come back here,
you cowardly little Smurfs.

[Gargamel coughing]

22:37.210 --> 22:38.190

22:38.210 --> 22:40.119
It's another witch.

22:40.140 --> 22:42.150

A whole lot of witches.

22:42.170 --> 22:45.000
[frogs ribbiting]

22:46.150 --> 22:50.180
There's nothing to fear. These
frogs are old friends of mine.

Wow, that's a relief.

22:52.210 --> 22:55.069
[frogs ribbiting]

22:55.089 --> 22:58.029
They're offering us
a ride to the village.
