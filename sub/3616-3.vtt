DOING DOWN HERE?

00:47.837 --> 00:49.736
SHOULDN'T YOU BE UPSTAIRS
STUDYING FOR PIPER'S QUIZ?

00:49.836 --> 00:52.862
WELL, I WAS KINDA HOPING

00:52.962 --> 00:54.154
TO GO A COUPLE ROUNDS
WITH THE DEMON FIRST.

I SHOULD TELL YOU,
PIPER TAKES HER WITCHCRAFT
QUIZZES VERY SERIOUSLY.

00:56.836 --> 01:00.734
YOU'D BETTER BE PREPARED.
WHAT'S THE SUBJECT?

01:00.834 --> 01:02.902
POTION BASICS.

01:03.002 --> 01:04.733
EW.
MM-HMM.

01:04.834 --> 01:05.818
WELL, YOU GOTTA
START SOMEWHERE.

01:09.209 --> 01:10.943
[SIGHS]
PAIGE, PIPER AND I
HAD TO LEARN

01:11.043 --> 01:14.359
HOW TO BE WITCHES

01:14.459 --> 01:15.732
AND IT TOOK...

01:15.832 --> 01:17.732

01:17.832 --> 01:19.608
WE NEED YOU

01:27.123 --> 01:29.748
WHEN THE FUN
STUFF STARTS.

01:32.372 --> 01:35.728
SO, WHERE WERE WE?

01:37.871 --> 01:39.396
OH, COME ON, COLE.

01:39.496 --> 01:41.103
YOU WERE GONE

01:41.203 --> 01:43.537
THAT IS 7 LONG,

01:49.831 --> 01:50.810
YEAH, I KNOW.

01:50.910 --> 01:53.227
THE SOURCE
WANTS US DEAD.

[SIGHS]
EVER SINCE WE ESCAPED,

01:57.200 --> 01:59.100
FACTIONS HAVE BEEN FORMING
TO CHALLENGE HIM.

01:59.200 --> 02:01.100
HE MUST FINISH
WHAT HE STARTED

02:01.200 --> 02:02.475
IF HE EXPECTS
TO SURVIVE...

02:02.575 --> 02:04.158

YOU NEED TO BE PREPARED.

02:07.241 --> 02:11.307
YOU THINK THE SOURCE
IS GONNA CHALLENGE ME
TO A SWORD FIGHT?

02:11.407 --> 02:14.431
HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT
IS TOO SAFE.

02:14.531 --> 02:15.989
SWORD FIGHTING TEACHES
CONFIDENCE, INTENSITY.

02:20.196 --> 02:24.155
YOU NEED TO LEARN HOW TO FIGHT
LIKE A DEMON, PHOEBE.

02:25.446 --> 02:26.987

BEFORE EVERYTHING...

02:29.321 --> 02:32.595

HE GIVE ME, ANLING?

03:53.681 --> 03:55.164
I WAS SUPPOSED
TO REPLACE HIM,

12:10.051 --> 12:11.243
PAIGE.

12:11.343 --> 12:12.534
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT. I DID IT,

12:12.634 --> 12:14.783
BUT IT WAS AN ACCIDENT,
I SWEAR.

12:14.883 --> 12:16.741
I JUST WANTED TO KNOW
WHAT IT WAS LIKE
TO BE YOU,

12:16.841 --> 12:18.949
AND SOMEHOW, THE POTION
I WAS WORKING ON

12:19.049 --> 12:21.614
JUST SORT OF BLEW UP.

12:21.714 --> 12:23.964
YOU WANTED TO BE ME?
ARE YOU CRAZY?

12:25.423 --> 12:27.048
OK, OK.
WE GOTTA FIX THIS.

12:29.297 --> 12:32.655
WHAT INGREDIENTS
DID YOU USE?

12:32.755 --> 12:34.612
I'M NOT SURE.

12:34.712 --> 12:35.862
JUST PLEASE
DON'T TELL PIPER.

12:35.962 --> 12:38.196
SHE ALREADY THINKS
I'M A SCREW UP AS IT IS.

12:38.296 --> 12:40.238
HELLO, PAIGE. WE ARE
IN EACH OTHER'S BODIES.

12:40.338 --> 12:44.170
I THINK PIPER
IS THE LEAST
OF OUR PROBLEMS.

12:44.378 --> 12:46.461
OK, FINE.
I WON'T TELL HER.

12:47.835 --> 12:50.777
NOW, WIPE THAT LOOK
OFF MY FACE.

12:50.877 --> 12:52.918
THANKS.

12:53.084 --> 12:55.708
GOD, THIS TOP IS TIGHT.

12:56.668 --> 12:58.607
YEAH, BUT IT SURE
LOOKS GREAT.

12:58.707 --> 12:59.607
Cole: SO...
[CLEARS THROAT]

12:59.707 --> 13:01.607
READY TO GET
BACK AT IT?

13:01.707 --> 13:02.983
YEAH, JUST
A MINUTE, SWEETIE.

13:03.083 --> 13:04.149
NOT YOU. PHOEBE.

13:04.249 --> 13:05.333
UH, SURE, SUGAR.
WHATEVER YOU SAY.

13:06.416 --> 13:09.357
LET'S GO
WORK UP A SWEAT.

13:09.457 --> 13:11.023
UH, JUST A MINUTE.

13:11.123 --> 13:13.398
ACTUALLY, PHOEBE
HAS TO STAY WITH ME.

13:13.498 --> 13:15.189
SHE HAS TO HELP ME,
UH, WITH A POTION.

13:15.289 --> 13:17.189
IT BLEW UP
IN MY FACE.

13:17.289 --> 13:18.772
IS THAT TRUE?

13:18.872 --> 13:20.703
WELL, SO LET ME ASK YOU
SOMETHING, PHOEBE.

13:22.703 --> 13:24.063
UM, WHY DID YOU
ASK ME TO TRAIN YOU?

13:24.163 --> 13:26.603
I MEAN, WHY ARE
WE WASTING OUR TIME?

13:26.703 --> 13:29.602
YOU'RE NOT WASTING
YOUR TIME, COLE.

13:29.702 --> 13:31.436
PHOEBE TOLD ME
HOW MUCH
SHE'S LEARNING--

13:31.536 --> 13:32.894
I'M SORRY, PAIGE.
THIS IS BETWEEN
ME AND PHOEBE.

13:32.994 --> 13:34.701
IF IT'S MORE IMPORTANT
FOR YOU TO HELP OUT
IN THE KITCHEN

13:36.328 --> 13:38.435
THAN TO TRAIN
FOR THE SOURCE,

13:38.535 --> 13:39.821
THEN YOU DON'T HAVE
WHAT IT TAKES
TO VANQUISH HIM,

13:39.831 --> 13:41.452
SO, PLEASE LET ME KNOW
WHEN THAT CHANGES.

13:43.699 --> 13:45.867
IF WE DON'T
FIX THIS SOON,

13:47.699 --> 13:51.158
I AM GOING
TO PERM YOUR HAIR.

13:57.865 --> 14:01.306
Man: COME BACK LATER.

14:01.406 --> 14:02.596
Anling: IF I COULD
COME BACK LATER, I WOULD,

14:02.696 --> 14:03.680
BUT I CAN'T.
I NEED IT NOW.

14:03.780 --> 14:05.347
THAT DAGGER
IS A FAMILY HEIRLOOM.

14:05.447 --> 14:07.347
IT'S NOT FOR SALE.

14:07.447 --> 14:08.472
EXCUSE ME. DO YOU
HAVE ANY WORMWOOD?

14:08.572 --> 14:10.596
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
I DON'T WANNA BUY IT.

14:10.696 --> 14:13.096
IT'S ALL RIGHT HERE
IN THE

14:13.196 --> 14:15.096
I DON'T READ CHINESE.

14:15.196 --> 14:16.593
UH, WORMWOOD.

14:16.693 --> 14:18.386
Anling:
YOU HAVE TO HELP ME.

14:18.486 --> 14:20.512
MY FATHER NEEDS
THE DRAGONBLADE.

14:20.612 --> 14:21.844
HE SAID
YOUR FATHER WOULD--

14:21.944 --> 14:23.010
MY FATHER'S OUT OF TOWN
UNTIL TUESDAY.

14:23.110 --> 14:24.593
YOU'LL HAVE
TO COME BACK THEN.

14:24.693 --> 14:25.802
EXCUSE ME.
I HAVE CUSTOMERS.

14:25.902 --> 14:28.591
YES. HI.
THANK YOU. HI.

14:28.691 --> 14:31.591
UM, I NEED
A SPRIG OF WORMWOOD.

14:31.691 --> 14:34.525
PREFERABLY
SMALL-STEMMED.

14:36.690 --> 14:39.757
Man: HEY!

14:39.857 --> 14:41.524
WHOO!

14:47.939 --> 14:51.105
HEY!

14:53.397 --> 14:56.686
WHO ARE YOU?

14:59.313 --> 15:02.462
ANLING.

15:02.562 --> 15:03.685
I HAVE IT, FATHER.

15:05.187 --> 15:06.103
UNH!

15:08.352 --> 15:09.584
NO!

15:09.684 --> 15:11.269
LIKE I SAID, WE'RE JUST
GETTING STARTED.

15:12.436 --> 15:15.683
Anling: FATHER!

15:20.142 --> 15:23.708
Anling: YENLO WAS
A POWERFUL DISCIPLE,

15:23.808 --> 15:24.999
BUT HE USED MY FATHER'S
TEACHINGS FOR EVIL.

15:25.099 --> 15:26.832
THAT'S WHY MY FATHER
PASSED HIM OVER
FOR MASTER,

15:26.932 --> 15:29.166
AND BECAUSE HE DID,
YENLO SWORE
VENGEANCE ON HIM.

15:29.266 --> 15:32.290
BUT DIDN'T YOU SAY
YOU STABBED YENLO
WHEN HE FIRST ATTACKED?

15:32.390 --> 15:34.664
YES, BUT HE USED
HIS KNOWLEDGE
OF THE TEACHINGS

15:34.764 --> 15:36.705
TO ESCAPE
BEFORE HE DIED.

15:36.805 --> 15:39.579
ESCAPE WHERE?
TO A PLACE

15:39.679 --> 15:40.925
WHERE SOULS PASS
ON THEIR WAY
TO REINCARNATION.

15:40.935 --> 15:43.538
IT'S A MYSTICAL
REGION BETWEEN
LIFE AND DEATH.

15:43.638 --> 15:46.870
LIMBO.
YENLO SOMEHOW

15:46.970 --> 15:48.620
FIGURED OUT A WAY
TO HIDE OUT THERE.

15:48.720 --> 15:50.745
BUT IF YOU STABBED HIM...

15:50.845 --> 15:52.576
Leo: METAPHYSICAL
AND MAGICAL LAWS

15:52.676 --> 15:54.036
ARE AMPLIFIED IN LIMBO.

15:54.136 --> 15:55.328
AS LONG
AS HE STAYS THERE,

15:55.428 --> 15:56.576
HIS WOUND WILL
NEVER ADVANCE.

15:56.676 --> 15:57.869
HE CAN LITERALLY
CHEAT DEATH FOREVER.

15:57.969 --> 16:00.243
THAT'S WHY I TOOK
THE DRAGONBLADE.

16:00.343 --> 16:02.452
IT HAS THE POWER
TO TRAP HUMAN SOULS.

16:02.552 --> 16:04.950
NOW, IT'S
THE ONLY WAY
TO SAVE MY FATHER.

16:05.050 --> 16:07.867
DO YOU THINK
HE'S STILL ALIVE?

16:07.967 --> 16:09.573
YENLO DOESN'T JUST
WANT TO KILL MY FATHER.

16:09.673 --> 16:12.283
HE WANTS TO PUNISH HIM.

16:12.383 --> 16:13.573
HOLDING HIM
IN LIMBO DOES THAT.

16:13.673 --> 16:15.572
IT KEEPS HIS SOUL
FROM BEING REBORN.

16:15.672 --> 16:17.715
DO YOU KNOW HOW TO,
UH, GET TO THIS LIMBO?

16:19.672 --> 16:22.214
NO, I NEVER
MASTERED THAT SKILL.

16:22.464 --> 16:26.339
WELL, THEN, WE'LL HAVE
TO FIGURE OUT OUR OWN WAY.

16:26.589 --> 16:29.613
PHOEBE, PAIGE.

16:29.713 --> 16:31.570
I CAN'T LET YOU DO THAT.

16:31.670 --> 16:33.029
I KNOW YOU'RE
POWERFUL WITCHES,

16:33.129 --> 16:34.446
BUT I CAN'T
PUT YOU IN DANGER.

16:34.546 --> 16:35.904
YENLO WILL BE
COMING FOR ME NEXT.

16:36.004 --> 16:38.028
ALL THE MORE REASON
YOU SHOULD BE HERE
WHERE IT'S SAFE.

16:38.128 --> 16:40.403
Anling: NO PLACE IS SAFE
FROM YENLO.

16:40.503 --> 16:41.861
HE CAN USE ANY SURFACE
OF WATER AS A PORTAL.

16:41.961 --> 16:44.567
MAYBE, BUT HE CAN
ONLY STAY IN OUR WORLD
FOR SHORT PERIODS.

16:44.667 --> 16:46.735
OTHERWISE, HIS WOUND
WILL ULTIMATELY KILL HIM.

16:46.835 --> 16:50.026
YOU CALLED?

16:50.126 --> 16:51.359
UM, THIS IS ANLING.

16:51.459 --> 16:54.026
HI, I'M PAIGE...

16:54.126 --> 16:56.665
I MEAN,
PAIGE'S OLDER
SISTER, PHOEBE.

16:56.833 --> 17:00.108
THIS IS PAIGE.

17:00.208 --> 17:02.624
HOWDY. HI. PAIGE HERE.

17:04.499 --> 17:05.664
UM, OK. WE'VE GOT
A WATER-LOVING DEMON,

17:08.205 --> 17:11.356
SO PHOEBE,
CAN YOU TAKE PAIGE
THROUGH THE WATER MAIN?

17:11.455 --> 17:13.521
IT TAKES 2 TO TURN OFF
THAT RUSTY VALVE.

17:13.622 --> 17:15.913
WATER MAIN. RIGHT.

17:18.661 --> 17:19.621
[LAUGHS]

17:22.621 --> 17:23.953
OK, BOOK OF SHADOWS.

17:25.869 --> 17:27.328
THERE'S GOTTA
BE ANOTHER WAY
TO GET INTO LIMBO.

17:37.535 --> 17:40.850
IT'S AMAZING
HOW OUR WOUNDS

17:40.950 --> 17:41.975
STOPPED BLEEDING
DOWN HERE, ISN'T IT?

17:42.075 --> 17:43.908
SEE? IT DOESN'T EVEN HURT.

17:45.656 --> 17:49.556
THIS PLACE WAS NOT MEANT
FOR US TO STAY, YENLO.

17:49.656 --> 17:52.432
TELL ME ABOUT IT.

17:52.532 --> 17:53.901
I ALWAYS EXPECTED
THE ENTRANCE
TO REINCARNATION

17:53.911 --> 17:55.848
TO BE A NICE RIVER,
OR EVEN PEARLY GATES.

17:55.948 --> 17:59.554
THE LAST THING
I EXPECTED TO SEE

17:59.654 --> 18:01.056
WAS A BIG, SUCKING HOLE.

18:01.156 --> 18:03.388
Zen Master: IT'S NEVER
TOO LATE FOR REDEMPTION.

18:03.488 --> 18:05.554
IF YOU ENTER
THAT VORTEX,

18:05.654 --> 18:08.678
YOU'LL CLEANSE
YOUR SOUL...

18:08.778 --> 18:11.179
START LIFE FRESH.

18:11.279 --> 18:12.636
YEAH, AS A TAPEWORM...

18:12.736 --> 18:15.094
OR MAYBE EVEN
A DUNG BEETLE.

18:15.194 --> 18:16.551
I KNOW HOW KARMA WORKS.

18:16.651 --> 18:19.178
BESIDES, I'VE WORKED
TOO HARD IN THIS LIFE

18:19.278 --> 18:21.968
TO GIVE IT ALL UP NOW.

18:22.068 --> 18:23.550
YOU'RE EVIL, YENLO.

18:23.650 --> 18:24.985
YOU HAVE NOTHING
IN THIS LIFE.

18:26.276 --> 18:27.549
I HAVE YOU,
WHICH MEANS

18:27.649 --> 18:29.426
NOW YOUR STUDENT REJECT
HAS A PURPOSE.

18:29.526 --> 18:32.216
I FIGURE, WHY STOP
AT JUST ONE ZEN MASTER

18:32.316 --> 18:34.341
WHEN I CAN RID
THE WORLD OF 2
OR 20 OR 100?

18:34.441 --> 18:37.647
ALL THEIR WISDOM
AND MAGIC LOST
FOREVER IN LIMBO.

18:38.773 --> 18:42.398
NOW THAT'S EVIL.
[LAUGHS]

18:42.981 --> 18:46.506
AND HAVE
I NOT TAUGHT YOU

18:46.606 --> 18:47.896
THAT YOU CAN NEVER
ESCAPE YOUR KARMA?

18:48.480 --> 18:50.645
NO ONE CAN.

18:51.645 --> 18:52.755
BUT THEN AGAIN,
NOBODY'S EVER ESCAPED

18:52.855 --> 18:55.521
FROM LIMBO BEFORE,
HAVE THEY?

18:55.644 --> 18:57.062
HOW DID YOU DO IT?

18:58.936 --> 19:01.378
I SEE NO WATER
AS A PORTAL
TO RETURN TO EARTH.

19:01.478 --> 19:04.626
I WAS WORRIED
ABOUT THAT AT FIRST,

19:04.726 --> 19:07.252
BUT THEN I REMEMBERED
THAT EVERY CLOUD

19:07.352 --> 19:09.542
HAS A NICE, WET,
WATERY LINING.

19:09.642 --> 19:12.584
[INHALES, EXHALES]

19:12.684 --> 19:14.917
WELL, I'M OFF
TO FIND YOUR DAUGHTER
AND KILL HER.

19:15.017 --> 19:18.640
WISH ME LUCK.
[INHALES]

19:21.308 --> 19:24.416
[BOTH GRUNT]

19:24.516 --> 19:26.249
CAREFUL.
DON'T BREAK MY NAILS.

19:26.349 --> 19:28.538
FORGET YOUR NAILS.
YOU ALMOST
GOT US BUSTED.

19:28.638 --> 19:30.538
NEXT TIME,
JUST SMILE AND NOD
WHEN WE'RE TOGETHER.

19:30.638 --> 19:32.872
WELL, THAT MIGHT
WORK WITH PIPER,

19:32.972 --> 19:34.538
BUT WHAT ABOUT THIS DEMON
THAT'S ON THE LOOSE?

19:34.638 --> 19:37.537
YOU'RE RIGHT.
WE MAY HAVE TO FIGHT.
CAN YOU LEVITATE?

19:37.637 --> 19:40.996
I HAVEN'T TRIED.

19:41.096 --> 19:43.163
THERE.
LEVITATE AND KICK...

19:43.263 --> 19:46.287
BUT FIRST, COULD YOU
LOSE THE LOLLIPOP?

19:46.387 --> 19:48.287
MY TEETH HAVE
ENOUGH CAVITIES.

19:48.387 --> 19:50.119
OOH, SORRY.

19:50.219 --> 19:52.302
NERVOUS HABIT.

19:57.552 --> 20:00.533
OOH! UNH.

20:00.633 --> 20:02.575
OH, MY GOD.
YOU ARE SO BAD
FOR MY IMAGE.

20:02.675 --> 20:05.551
OH! PIPER IS NEVER
GONNA TRUST ME
WITH MAGIC AGAIN.

20:06.632 --> 20:10.241
PIPER WON'T
FIND OUT ANYTHING

20:10.341 --> 20:11.741
AS LONG AS WE
REVERSE THE POTION.

20:11.841 --> 20:13.530
WELL...

20:13.630 --> 20:15.698
I THINK
I'VE FIGURED OUT

20:15.798 --> 20:16.698
HOW TO MIX A NEW BATCH,

20:16.798 --> 20:17.905
BUT WE'RE ALL OUT
OF POWDERED TOADSTOOL.

20:18.005 --> 20:20.197
I KNOW WHERE
TO GET SOME.

20:20.297 --> 20:21.406
YOU STAY HERE.

20:21.506 --> 20:22.406
AVOID PIPER
AT ALL COSTS,

20:22.506 --> 20:24.838
AND PRACTICE
MY POWER.
YOU MAY NEED IT.

20:26.628 --> 20:26.921
[SIGHS]

20:31.462 --> 20:31.753
CAN I HELP YOU?

20:34.628 --> 20:35.527
[LAUGHS]
SENSE OF HUMOR.

20:35.627 --> 20:37.777
I REALLY LIKE
THAT IN A GIRL.

20:37.877 --> 20:39.877
SO, ARE YOU
READY TO GO, PAIGE?

20:40.876 --> 20:43.027
PAIGE. UH...

20:43.127 --> 20:45.525
MASON, HI.
HOW ARE YOU?

20:45.625 --> 20:47.608
I'M FINE.
DO I KNOW YOU?

20:47.708 --> 20:50.359
NO, NO,
BUT I KNOW YOU.

20:50.459 --> 20:52.523
AT LEAST, I FEEL
LIKE I KNOW YOU

20:52.623 --> 20:54.191
SEEING AS HOW
PAIGE CAN'T STOP
TALKING ABOUT YOU.

20:54.291 --> 20:56.858
MASON, THE BOSS'S SON.

20:56.958 --> 20:58.606
HE'S AS CUTE
AS YOU SAID HE WAS.

20:58.706 --> 21:00.690
WELL, UH, NICE
TO SEE YOU. BYE.

21:00.790 --> 21:03.689
Paige: NO, WAIT...

21:03.789 --> 21:04.981
AREN'T YOU GUYS
GOING FOR DINNER?

21:05.081 --> 21:06.605
YEAH, IS ITALIAN OK?

21:06.705 --> 21:08.273
CHINESE.
YOU MUST HAVE CHINESE.

21:08.373 --> 21:10.855
CHINATOWN CHINESE.
EVEN BETTER.

21:10.955 --> 21:13.855
THAT--THAT'S COOL.

21:13.955 --> 21:15.662
OK.

21:16.619 --> 21:17.954
OK, SO YOU 2 KIDS
HAVE FUN,

21:20.994 --> 21:24.618
AND KEEP MY FACE
OUTTA THE SUN.

21:27.617 --> 21:30.768
WHO WAS AT THE DOOR?

21:30.868 --> 21:31.767
MMM, JUST PAIGE'S DATE.

21:31.867 --> 21:34.516
SHE'S STILL
GOING ON HER DATE?

21:34.616 --> 21:36.034
UGH. WHAT'S WITH
THE LOLLIPOP?

21:37.158 --> 21:39.975
PAIGE SORT OF
GOT ME INTO THEM.
[LAUGHS]

21:40.075 --> 21:42.849
PHOEBE, I GOTTA
BE HONEST.

21:42.949 --> 21:44.514
I'M REALLY STARTING
TO WORRY ABOUT HER.

21:44.614 --> 21:46.182
WHY? WHAT'S WRONG
WITH PAIGE?

21:46.282 --> 21:48.806
WELL, FIRST OF ALL,
SHE MADE ME REALIZE

21:48.906 --> 21:50.723
I HATE BEING
THE BIG SISTER,

21:50.823 --> 21:52.473
AND IT'S SUDDENLY
MY RESPONSIBILITY

21:52.573 --> 21:54.431
TO TEACH HER
HOW TO BE A WITCH,

21:54.531 --> 21:55.888
AND SHE DOESN'T
LISTEN TO ME.

21:55.988 --> 21:57.763
OH, SHE LISTENS
SOMETIMES.

21:57.863 --> 22:00.263
REALLY? 'CAUSE
SHE'S GOT ME FOOLED,

22:00.363 --> 22:02.304
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S A SHAME BECAUSE

22:02.404 --> 22:04.138
SHE MIGHT ACTUALLY
HAVE A LOT OF POTENTIAL.

22:04.238 --> 22:06.345
REALLY?

22:06.445 --> 22:08.510
BUT THE PROBLEM IS,
I DON'T THINK SHE CARES
ABOUT ANYTHING.

22:08.610 --> 22:12.052
OH, NO. SHE CARES.
I KNOW SHE DOES.

22:12.152 --> 22:15.344
YOU JUST HAVE
TO GIVE HER A CHANCE.

22:15.444 --> 22:17.026
I THINK PAIGE
IS THE KIND
OF PERSON THAT...

22:17.235 --> 22:20.676
NEEDS TO LEARN
FROM HER MISTAKES,

22:20.776 --> 22:22.858
AND BELIEVE ME,
SHE'S LEARNING FAST.

22:23.607 --> 22:26.608
MM-HMM.

22:27.567 --> 22:28.024
[SIGHS]

22:34.107 --> 22:37.605
UH. HMM.
WHAT IS THIS PLACE?

22:37.815 --> 22:41.089
[PHOEBE SIGHS]

22:41.189 --> 22:43.604
I JUST GOTTA FIND
SOME POWDERED TOADSTOOL.

22:44.106 --> 22:47.422
AH, HERE IT IS.

22:47.522 --> 22:49.088
OK, I--I GOTTA WARN YOU.

22:49.188 --> 22:50.255
I'M NOT INTO
THE WHOLE HERBAL SCENE.

22:50.355 --> 22:52.502
OH, NEITHER IS PAIGE,
I DON'T THINK.

22:52.602 --> 22:54.337
YOU ALWAYS
TALK ABOUT YOURSELF

22:54.437 --> 22:55.670
IN THE THIRD PERSON
LIKE THAT?

22:55.770 --> 22:57.044
IT'S KIND OF
A CHARACTER FLAW OF MINE.

22:57.144 --> 22:59.811
SO, WHAT'S
THE TOADSTOOL FOR?

22:59.977 --> 23:03.377
IT'S AN APHRODISIAC.

23:03.477 --> 23:05.168
REALLY?

23:05.268 --> 23:07.252
MY DAD WAS RIGHT.

23:07.352 --> 23:08.959
HE SAID
YOU WERE UH...

23:09.059 --> 23:10.499
"UNIQUE," I BELIEVE
IS THE WORD HE USED.

23:10.599 --> 23:12.126
OH, YEAH? WHAT ELSE
DID HE SAY ABOUT ME?

23:12.226 --> 23:15.125
HE SAID THAT IF
HE DOESN'T HURRY UP

23:15.225 --> 23:16.498
AND MAKE YOU
A SOCIAL WORKER,

23:16.598 --> 23:17.916
YOU'LL PROBABLY
QUIT AND START
YOUR OWN AGENCY...

23:18.016 --> 23:19.416
THAT, OR END UP
IN JAIL.

23:19.516 --> 23:21.416
HE WASN'T
SURE WHICH.

23:21.516 --> 23:22.873
SOUNDS LIKE ME
AT THAT AGE.

23:22.973 --> 23:25.373
YOU LOST ME AGAIN.

23:25.473 --> 23:27.764
[SIGHS]
I'M NOT SHOWING YOU
A VERY GOOD TIME, AM I?

23:29.181 --> 23:32.122
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.
I MEAN, WE'RE
IN CHINATOWN

23:32.222 --> 23:34.496
SHOPPING FOR
A SEXUAL STIMULANT.

23:34.596 --> 23:36.246
I'M SURROUNDED
BY CHICKEN CLAWS
AND GOAT BRAINS.

23:36.346 --> 23:39.079
I HAVEN'T HAD
AS MUCH FUN
IN A LONG TIME.

23:39.179 --> 23:40.578
COME TO THINK OF IT,
NEITHER HAVE I.

23:40.678 --> 23:43.412
MY BOYFRIEND'S
NOT REALLY BIG

23:43.512 --> 23:44.494
ON THE FUN
FACTOR LATELY.

23:44.594 --> 23:45.786
YOUR BOYFRIEND?

23:45.886 --> 23:46.927
EX-BOYFRIEND.
OH.

23:48.592 --> 23:49.592
UH-OH, YENLO.

23:51.718 --> 23:53.993
UH, WHAT'S THAT,
ANOTHER APHRODISIAC?

23:54.093 --> 23:55.926
I GOTTA GO.

24:08.632 --> 24:11.798
OH.

24:12.423 --> 24:13.588
OH.
[SIGHS]

24:15.587 --> 24:18.697
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

24:18.797 --> 24:19.838
UH, JUST...

24:20.713 --> 24:24.071
SOME EXERCISES...

24:24.171 --> 24:25.696
LEVITATING EXERCISES.

24:25.796 --> 24:28.486
SO, YOU'VE DECIDED
TO MAKE TRAINING
YOUR PRIORITY?

24:28.586 --> 24:31.278
YES, ABSOLUTELY.

24:31.378 --> 24:33.111
GOOD, WE'LL PICK UP
WHERE WE LEFT OFF.

24:33.211 --> 24:35.444
GREAT. COOL.

24:35.544 --> 24:39.483
I'LL THROW A COUPLE
OF LOW VOLTAGE
ENERGY BALLS AT YOU,

24:39.583 --> 24:41.609
YOU JUST TRY
TO AVOID THEM.

24:41.709 --> 24:43.110
ENERGY BALLS?

24:43.210 --> 24:44.401
OH!

24:44.501 --> 24:46.401
OOH!

24:46.501 --> 24:47.482
OK, NOW,
THAT'S JUST RUDE.

24:47.582 --> 24:49.481
I AM NOT HAVING FUN.

24:49.581 --> 24:51.274
FIGHTING THE SOURCE
ISN'T SUPPOSED
TO BE FUN.

24:51.374 --> 24:53.024
THAT'S IT, PAL.
YOU ARE NOT THE SOURCE,

24:53.124 --> 24:55.523
AND YOU DO NOT TREAT
YOUR GIRLFRIEND THIS WAY.

24:55.623 --> 24:57.856
MURDERERS, DEMONS,
PHONE SOLICITORS, MAYBE,

24:57.956 --> 25:01.106
BUT NOT YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

25:01.206 --> 25:02.897
WHAT'S GOTTEN INTO YOU?

25:02.997 --> 25:04.855
PAIGE...

25:04.955 --> 25:07.521
I MEAN...

25:07.621 --> 25:09.729
I TOLD PAIGE HOW YOU'VE
BEEN TREATING ME,

25:09.829 --> 25:13.577
AND SHE JUST THINKS
YOU'RE WAY OUT
OF LINE, BUDDY.

25:13.912 --> 25:17.769
PHOEBE, YOU'RE
THE MOST IMPORTANT
THING IN MY LIFE.

25:17.869 --> 25:20.911
IF I DON'T
PUSH YOU HARD,
I WILL LOSE YOU.

25:21.161 --> 25:24.643
WELL, KEEP PUSHING
HER THAT WAY...

25:24.743 --> 25:28.227
AND YOU'LL PUSH HER
RIGHT OUT THE DOOR.

25:28.327 --> 25:30.517
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"HER?"

25:30.617 --> 25:32.184
I MEANT ME.

25:32.284 --> 25:34.473
YOU SAID "HER."
DID I?

25:34.573 --> 25:36.473
WELL, I'M JUST VERY...

25:36.573 --> 25:39.473
ANGRY, YOU KNOW,
BECAUSE...

25:39.573 --> 25:42.472
WELL, YOU TORE
MY JOGBRA,

25:42.572 --> 25:44.932
AND NOW, I JUST...

25:45.032 --> 25:48.364
I HAVE TO GO CHANGE.

26:00.029 --> 26:03.719
Piper: THERE IS ACTUALLY
NOTHING IN HERE

26:03.819 --> 26:06.303
ON HOW TO REACH LIMBO.

26:06.403 --> 26:08.593
[SIGHS]

26:08.693 --> 26:10.302
SHOULD YOU HAVE
THAT WATER UP HERE?

26:10.402 --> 26:11.635
I MEAN, WHAT IF YENLO
USES THAT AS A PORTAL?

26:11.735 --> 26:14.051
IT'S OK.

26:14.151 --> 26:15.385
THE SURFACE
IS TOO SMALL
FOR HIM TO ENTER.

26:15.485 --> 26:17.509
SO, W-WHAT
ARE YOU DOIN'?

26:17.609 --> 26:20.092
Anling: MY FATHER
COULD USE WATER

26:20.192 --> 26:22.133
AS A LOOKING GLASS
INTO OTHER WORLDS.

26:22.233 --> 26:24.465
ONCE, WHEN
I WAS YOUNG,

26:24.565 --> 26:26.007
HE REACHED
INTO A BOWL OF WATER

26:26.107 --> 26:28.049
AND PICKED ME A PLUM
FROM THE GARDEN OF EDEN.

26:28.149 --> 26:30.631
CAN YOU SEE
YOUR FATHER NOW?

26:30.731 --> 26:33.563
NO, I ONLY SEE WATER.

26:34.606 --> 26:38.462
I WISH HE WERE HERE.
HE'D KNOW WHAT TO DO.

26:38.562 --> 26:41.838
I'D BETTER GO CHECK
WITH THE ELDERS.

26:41.938 --> 26:43.561
MAYBE THEY CAN
HELP US REACH LIMBO.

26:44.561 --> 26:45.561
SOMETIMES I THINK
YENLO WAS RIGHT.

26:48.270 --> 26:50.586
MY FATHER MADE
THE WRONG CHOICE.

26:50.686 --> 26:52.962
YENLO WAS ALWAYS
THE BETTER STUDENT.

26:53.062 --> 26:55.269
OH, I DOUBT THAT.
YOU BEAT HIM IN BATTLE.

26:56.894 --> 27:00.584
BUT I DIDN'T KILL HIM.
I MADE HIM STRONGER...

27:00.684 --> 27:03.210
STRONG ENOUGH
TO REMOVE MY FATHER'S

27:03.310 --> 27:05.457
MAGIC AND WISDOM
FROM THE WORLD.

27:05.557 --> 27:08.184
I DON'T FEEL
WORTHY OF FOLLOWING
IN HIS FOOTSTEPS.

27:09.725 --> 27:11.391
I UNDERSTAND.

27:13.099 --> 27:15.349
I RECENTLY LOST
MY BIG SISTER WHO WAS...

27:16.098 --> 27:19.873
PRETTY GOOD AT JUST ABOUT
EVERYTHING SHE DID...

27:19.973 --> 27:22.597
VERY TOUGH SHOES
TO FILL.

27:23.139 --> 27:26.580
WHERE DID YOU FIND
THE STRENGTH?

27:26.680 --> 27:28.663
I HAVEN'T YET...

27:28.763 --> 27:32.553
BUT I'LL LET
YOU KNOW WHEN I DO.

27:35.095 --> 27:38.452
COME ON.
WITH ALL THIS RAIN,

27:38.552 --> 27:40.136
WE HAVE TO PROTECT
THE HOUSE FROM YENLO.

27:53.134 --> 27:56.300
OOH.

28:09.756 --> 28:12.947
AAH! COLE.

28:13.047 --> 28:14.947
YOU SCARED ME.

28:15.047 --> 28:16.445
Cole: SORRY.

28:16.545 --> 28:17.540
DIDN'T MEAN TO
WITH THE RAIN OUTSIDE,

28:17.550 --> 28:19.695
AND EVERYONE
ON YENLO ALERT.

28:19.795 --> 28:21.404
Paige: YEAH, YENLO.

28:21.504 --> 28:22.404
THAT'S WHY
I RUSHED HOME.

28:22.504 --> 28:24.443
YOU'RE CHILLED.
HERE, PUT THIS ON.

28:24.543 --> 28:26.444
UH, YOU KEEP IT.

28:26.544 --> 28:29.252
I'M SORRY. AM I
MAKING YOU FEEL,
AHEM, UNCOMFORTABLE?

28:29.542 --> 28:32.777
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

28:32.877 --> 28:34.442
I WAS JUST WONDERING
WHAT PHOEBE WOULD
THINK ABOUT THIS.

28:34.542 --> 28:37.151
Cole: PHOEBE?

28:37.251 --> 28:38.401
UH, YEAH. YOUR
GIRLFRIEND, PHOEBE.

28:38.501 --> 28:40.440
REMEMBER?

28:40.540 --> 28:41.578
YEAH. YOU SEE,
THE PROBLEM WITH PHOEBE

28:41.588 --> 28:42.691
IS SHE'S SO OBSESSED
WITH TRAINING,

28:42.791 --> 28:44.791
SHE'S NOT INTERESTED
IN ROMANCE ANYMORE.

28:45.333 --> 28:48.774
THAT'S NOT TRUE.
I--I MEAN, SHE--

28:48.874 --> 28:51.191
YOU, ON THE OTHER HAND,

28:51.291 --> 28:52.522
STRIKE ME AS BEING
FULL OF PASSION, DESIRE.

28:52.622 --> 28:55.856
I MISS THAT.

28:55.956 --> 28:57.437
I GOTTA GO.

28:57.537 --> 28:59.537
AHH.

29:00.039 --> 29:00.537
HEY!

29:03.204 --> 29:04.371
UHH.

29:05.954 --> 29:07.871
HOW COULD YOU
DO THIS TO ME?

29:09.535 --> 29:11.020
OH, COME ON.

29:11.120 --> 29:12.435
I'M JUST TRYING TO HAVE
A LITTLE FUN, PHOEBE.

29:12.535 --> 29:14.145
ISN'T THAT WHAT YOU
WERE BEEN COMPLAINING
ABOUT ME NOT DOING?

29:14.245 --> 29:16.434
YEAH, BUT I
NEVER MEANT FOR--

29:16.534 --> 29:17.994
DID YOU JUST
CALL ME PHOEBE?

29:19.327 --> 29:21.768
WOULD YOU RATHER
I KISSED HER?

29:21.868 --> 29:23.951
NO.

29:24.951 --> 29:26.184
YOU KNOW?
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

29:26.284 --> 29:28.558
WELL, FOR ONE THING,
YOU SUCK AT LEVITATING,

29:28.658 --> 29:31.266
AND, FOR ANOTHER,
YOU SET ME STRAIGHT

29:31.366 --> 29:32.724
ABOUT THE WAY I'VE BEEN
TREATING THE REAL PHOEBE

29:32.824 --> 29:34.599
AS ONLY A SISTER COULD.

29:34.699 --> 29:37.015
YOU DID?

29:37.115 --> 29:38.015
SOMEONE HAD TO.

29:38.115 --> 29:39.556
[SIGHS] OK.

29:39.656 --> 29:41.598
I'M GONNA GO.

29:41.698 --> 29:43.222
LET YOU GUYS
WORK THIS OUT.

29:43.322 --> 29:45.739
WHEN YOU'RE YOURSELF
AGAIN, GIVE ME A CALL.

29:47.197 --> 29:49.528
UNH. OOH.

29:50.488 --> 29:52.238
WE'LL HAVE SOME FUN.

29:53.488 --> 29:57.137
OK. WE'VE GOT TO GET
BACK INTO OUR OWN BODIES.

29:57.237 --> 29:59.427
I AM EVEN
GETTING CONFUSED.

29:59.527 --> 30:01.426
Anling: PIPER!

30:01.526 --> 30:03.361
UHH!

30:07.693 --> 30:11.109
THE DRAGONBLADE.

30:13.192 --> 30:16.424
PHOEBE, STOP HIM!

30:16.524 --> 30:18.316
AAH!

30:19.649 --> 30:20.358
WHOO, WHOO, WHOO!

30:31.521 --> 30:34.420
EEE!

30:34.520 --> 30:35.563
LEO!

30:39.022 --> 30:39.519
ANLING'S HURT.

30:42.396 --> 30:44.645
YOU TWO,
FOLLOW ME!

30:48.602 --> 30:52.417
ALL RIGHT. WHAT
THE HELL IS GOING ON?

30:52.517 --> 30:56.251
I WAS SOAKING
SOME POTION POTS
IN THE SINK,

30:56.351 --> 30:58.626
AND I FORGOT
TO DRAIN THEM.

30:58.726 --> 31:00.416
THAT IS NOT WHAT I MEAN.

31:00.516 --> 31:01.584
I SMELL SOMETHING WITCHY.

31:01.684 --> 31:03.392
PHOEBE, WHAT IS WRONG
WITH YOUR POWERS?

31:03.641 --> 31:05.475
PHOEBE?

31:06.891 --> 31:08.182
I'M OVER HERE.

31:09.557 --> 31:11.057
DON'T GET MAD AT HER.
THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.

31:13.348 --> 31:16.413
YEAH, BUT, PAIGE,
I AGREED TO KEEP IT SECRET.

31:16.513 --> 31:18.622
YEAH, BUT I WAS
THE ONE WHO MESSED
UP THE POTION.

31:18.722 --> 31:20.412
I WASN'T
CONCENTRATING.
I JUST GUESSED.

31:20.512 --> 31:23.122
OH, MY GOD!

31:23.222 --> 31:26.579
YOU GUYS SWITCHED BODIES.
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MINDS?

31:26.679 --> 31:30.510
WITH EVERYTHING
WE HAVE GOING ON, YOU
PULL A STUNT LIKE THIS?

31:31.510 --> 31:34.786
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

31:34.886 --> 31:36.077
ACCIDENTS LIKE THAT
GET PEOPLE KILLED.

31:36.177 --> 31:38.994
WE COULD HAVE LOST
AN INNOCENT IN THERE.

31:39.094 --> 31:40.493
WHAT IF IT WASN'T YENLO?

31:40.593 --> 31:42.076
WHAT IF IT WAS
THE SOURCE THAT BROKE IN?

31:42.176 --> 31:43.508
YOU COULD HAVE
GOTTEN US ALL KILLED.

31:43.759 --> 31:45.509
NOW WE'VE LOST OUR SHOT
AT YENLO.

31:47.507 --> 31:49.009
WE HAVE NO IDEA
HOW TO GET TO LIMBO--

31:51.175 --> 31:51.717
WAIT A MINUTE.

31:54.506 --> 31:56.199
DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT
YOU PUT IN THAT POTION
TO SWITCH BODIES?

31:56.299 --> 32:00.240
PHOEBE JUST PICKED
UP THE INGREDIENT
WE WERE MISSING.

32:00.340 --> 32:02.865
GOOD. LET'S GO.

32:02.965 --> 32:05.404
ALL RIGHT.
WHAT ELSE DID YOU

32:05.504 --> 32:07.572
I MEAN, YOU PUT IN THIS?

32:07.672 --> 32:10.487
JUST THE POWDERED
TOAD STOOL.

32:10.587 --> 32:13.796
ALL RIGHT, SOUL SISTERS,
BACK IN YOUR OWN BODIES.

32:14.713 --> 32:16.962
Both: I WANT
TO BE ME AGAIN.

32:18.421 --> 32:21.086
OOH!
OOH!

32:24.044 --> 32:27.484
OHH, IT'S NICE
TO SEE YOU, PAIGE.

32:27.584 --> 32:30.443
[SIGHS] IT'S NICE
TO BE SEEN, PHOEBE.

32:30.543 --> 32:33.984
MY GOD, WHAT DID
YOU HAVE FOR DINNER?

32:34.084 --> 32:36.525
KUNG PAO CHICKEN.
SORRY.

32:36.625 --> 32:38.398
OK, NOT TO CUT
THIS REUNION SHORT,

32:38.498 --> 32:41.566
BUT WE DON'T HAVE
A LOT OF TIME.

32:41.666 --> 32:43.398
SO THE ONLY PERSON WHO
KNOWS HOW TO ENTER LIMBO

32:43.498 --> 32:45.481
IS IN LIMBO HIMSELF.

32:45.581 --> 32:46.982
AND SINCE WE CAN'T GET TO
ANLING'S FATHER DOWN THERE,

32:47.082 --> 32:49.898
MY PLAN IS TO
BRING HIM UP HERE

32:49.998 --> 32:53.356
OR AT LEAST
HIS SOUL.

32:53.456 --> 32:55.272
WAIT. YOU WANT
TO SWAP SOULS

32:55.372 --> 32:57.395
WITH ANLING'S FATHER?

32:57.495 --> 32:58.897
HE'S THE ONLY ONE
WHO KNOWS HOW TO GET IN.

32:58.997 --> 33:01.394
BESIDES, IT'S THE BEST
WAY TO SURPRISE YENLO.

33:01.494 --> 33:04.062
IT'S TOO RISKY.
THERE'S GOTTA BE
ANOTHER WAY.

33:04.162 --> 33:06.393
DID THE ELDERS HAVE
ANY OTHER IDEAS?

33:06.493 --> 33:09.145
NO.

33:09.245 --> 33:10.536
THEN THERE'S NOT.

33:10.744 --> 33:12.285
OK.

33:13.910 --> 33:15.492
I WANT TO BE
THE ZEN MASTER.

33:16.535 --> 33:19.492
OOH!

33:35.323 --> 33:38.823
YOU HAVE A VERY
BRAVE SISTER.

33:39.115 --> 33:40.947
FATHER?

33:42.364 --> 33:44.239
YES, ANLING. I'M HERE.

33:45.486 --> 33:46.486
WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME.

33:48.946 --> 33:51.195
WHERE IS
THE DRAGONBLADE?

33:52.278 --> 33:54.137
I USED IT TO FIGHT YENLO,

33:54.237 --> 33:56.760
BUT HE KNOCKED IT
OUT OF MY HANDS.

33:56.860 --> 33:59.427
PHOEBE, DID YOU
PICK IT UP?

33:59.527 --> 34:01.261
NO. PAIGE?

34:01.361 --> 34:03.010
I HAVEN'T SEEN IT.

34:03.110 --> 34:05.068
THEN WHO HAS
THE DRAGONBLADE?

34:09.565 --> 34:12.925
WHAT HAPPENED, OLD MAN?

34:13.025 --> 34:14.216
I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT HAPPENED?

34:14.315 --> 34:17.674
I WAS TELLING YOU
HOW I STOLE
THE DRAGONBLADE

34:17.774 --> 34:19.715
FROM YOUR USELESS DAUGHTER
WHEN YOU BLACKED OUT.

34:19.815 --> 34:21.882
I DID?

34:21.982 --> 34:23.380
I MEAN, I DID...

34:23.480 --> 34:25.589
IF YOU SAY SO.

34:25.688 --> 34:26.630
WHO ARE YOU?!

34:26.730 --> 34:27.730
I AM ONE
WITH THE UNIVERSE.

34:28.772 --> 34:31.920
[LAUGHS]

34:32.021 --> 34:34.170
YOU THINK
YOU CAN FOOL ME?

34:34.271 --> 34:35.713
I WAS HIS DISCIPLE
FOR 20 YEARS.

34:35.813 --> 34:38.062
ANLING DOESN'T HAVE
THE POWER TO SWITCH SOULS,

34:39.687 --> 34:41.753
SO YOU MUST BE
ONE OF THE WITCHES,

34:41.853 --> 34:43.418
WHICH MEANS ANLING
AND HER FATHER

34:43.518 --> 34:44.793
WILL COME TO RESCUE YOU.

34:44.893 --> 34:47.295
THE QUESTION IS...

34:47.395 --> 34:49.043
HOW ARE THEY GOING
TO GET YOUR SOUL BACK

34:49.143 --> 34:51.435
WHEN I'VE GOT IT?

34:53.060 --> 34:56.351
[GROANING]

35:08.473 --> 35:12.039
THIS IS ALL
WE COULD FIND.

35:12.139 --> 35:13.764
THEN YENLO MUST HAVE
THE DRAGONBLADE.

35:16.470 --> 35:20.163
AND USED IT TO CAPTURE
YOUR SISTER'S SOUL.

35:20.263 --> 35:22.745
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

35:22.845 --> 35:23.871
HOW DO WE GET
PIPER BACK?

35:23.971 --> 35:25.288
WE NEED TO GET
THE DRAGONBLADE
AWAY FROM YENLO.

35:25.388 --> 35:27.995
OK, SO WHAT ARE
WE WAITING FOR?
SHOW US THE WAY.

35:28.095 --> 35:30.661
I SHOULD GO ALONE.

35:30.761 --> 35:32.161
PIPER DID THIS FOR ME,
TO SAVE MY FATHER'S LIFE.

35:32.261 --> 35:34.551
NO. SHE'S OUR SISTER.
WE'LL ALL GO.

35:34.760 --> 35:38.367
IS THAT WHAT YOU WERE
FIGHTING TO SAVE--

35:38.467 --> 35:41.201
MY LIFE?

35:41.301 --> 35:42.366
OF COURSE, FATHER.

35:42.466 --> 35:44.117
WHEN WE BRING YOU BACK,

35:44.217 --> 35:45.365
THEIR WHITELIGHTER
CAN HEAL YOUR WOUND.

35:45.465 --> 35:47.384
HE'S A MIRACLE WORKER.
I'VE SEEN HIM.

35:48.967 --> 35:50.174
YOU ARE RIGHT.
WE SHOULD ALL GO,

35:52.507 --> 35:54.241
BUT IT IS A DIFFERENT
REALM DOWN THERE

35:54.341 --> 35:55.823
WITH NEW RULES.

35:55.923 --> 35:57.363
YENLO HAS HAD TIME
TO LEARN AND ADJUST.

35:57.463 --> 36:00.115
Leo: FINE,
THEN LET'S GO.

36:00.215 --> 36:01.457
IF YOU GO,
YOU RISK BEING PULLED
INTO THE VORTEX.

36:01.467 --> 36:04.655
WHO WOULD HEAL
OUR INJURIES?

36:04.755 --> 36:06.462
HE IS RIGHT, LEO.
YOU SHOULD STAY HERE.

36:13.045 --> 36:16.460
OK. HERE GOES NOTHIN'.

36:35.666 --> 36:38.874
PIPER.

36:40.249 --> 36:43.355
THE DRAGONBLADE,
WHERE IS IT?

36:43.455 --> 36:46.247
QUIET.

36:46.455 --> 36:47.454
LOOK OUT!

36:49.747 --> 36:51.122
HYAH!

36:56.372 --> 36:59.352
FATHER!

36:59.452 --> 37:00.787
WELCOME TO MY TURF.

37:05.619 --> 37:09.018
LOOK! YENLO'S BELT!

37:09.118 --> 37:10.451
I DIDN'T EVEN CALL FOR IT.

37:12.450 --> 37:14.269
IT JUST HAPPENED.

37:14.369 --> 37:15.642
OUR POWERS MUST BE
EXPANDED HERE.

37:15.742 --> 37:17.492
YOU GET PIPER'S SOUL
OUT OF THE DRAGONBLADE.

37:18.909 --> 37:21.325
I'M GOING TO KEEP
YENLO BUSY.

37:22.699 --> 37:26.140
OH, IT'S YOU,
BLACK BELT BARBIE.

37:26.240 --> 37:29.074
YOU'RE GOING TO BE SORRY
YOU SAID THAT. HYAH!

37:32.281 --> 37:35.346
UNH!

37:35.446 --> 37:37.013
PHOEBE, WHAT DO I DO?

37:37.113 --> 37:38.445
I DON'T KNOW.
USE YOUR POWERS.
ORB HER SOUL.

37:50.611 --> 37:53.803
UNH! OOH!

37:53.903 --> 37:55.319
NOW WHAT?

37:56.319 --> 37:57.219
PUT IT BACK IN THE BODY!

37:57.319 --> 37:58.818
[FIGHTING CONTINUES]

37:58.985 --> 38:00.234
THANKS FOR THE LIFT.

38:02.441 --> 38:03.943
UNTIE ME.

38:12.232 --> 38:15.465
WE GOT TO DO SOMETHING.

38:15.565 --> 38:17.398
WHAT? I DON'T HAVE
THE POWER IN THIS BODY.

38:17.940 --> 38:19.522
AAH!

38:21.106 --> 38:22.437
OH, MY ANKLE!

38:23.688 --> 38:24.588
I THINK IT'S TWISTED.

38:24.688 --> 38:26.005
I NEED A TIME-OUT.

38:26.105 --> 38:27.647
A TIME-OUT?

38:28.979 --> 38:30.336
THIS WILL BE EASIER
THAN I THOUGHT.

38:30.436 --> 38:32.587
FOR ME, TOO.

38:32.687 --> 38:34.062
PAIGE!

38:37.228 --> 38:40.435
[GURGLING NOISES]

39:06.223 --> 39:09.622
OH, MY GOD.
IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL.

39:09.722 --> 39:12.248
WHAT HAPPENED?

39:12.348 --> 39:13.971
BEATS THE HELL OUT OF ME.

39:14.221 --> 39:17.328
PIPER?

39:17.428 --> 39:18.512
HELLO.

39:20.137 --> 39:23.495
THE NATURAL ORDER
OF THINGS

39:23.595 --> 39:25.036
HAS BEEN RESTORED,

39:25.136 --> 39:26.702
INCLUDING OUR SOULS.

39:26.802 --> 39:28.326
BUT HOW?

39:28.426 --> 39:29.719
THIS WAS ALL
A REFLECTION
ON YENLO'S FEARS,

39:30.135 --> 39:33.618
OF A MAN AFRAID
OF CROSSING OVER.

39:33.718 --> 39:36.425
IN TRUTH, THIS IS
A PEACEFUL PLACE,

39:37.424 --> 39:40.492
WELCOMING.

39:40.592 --> 39:42.323
WE NEED TO GET YOU HOME

39:42.423 --> 39:44.200
AND HEAL YOUR WOUND.

39:44.300 --> 39:45.950
NO. I WAS
MORTALLY WOUNDED.

39:46.050 --> 39:49.090
IT IS MY TIME TO DIE,
TO BE REBORN.

39:49.715 --> 39:53.321
THEIR WHITELIGHTER
CAN HEAL.

39:53.421 --> 39:55.322
ANLING, YOU KNOW BETTER

39:55.422 --> 39:59.239
THAN TO CLING TO
THE PHYSICAL WORLD

39:59.339 --> 40:01.613
THE WAY YOU CLUNG TO
MY HAND AT THE BRIDGE.

40:01.713 --> 40:04.071
BUT YOU'RE MY FATHER.

40:04.171 --> 40:06.419
I'M NO GREATER OR LESS
THAN ANYONE FACING
DEATH.

40:06.670 --> 40:10.318
THAT'S THE ONLY LESSON
THAT KEEPS YOU

40:10.418 --> 40:12.337
FROM BEING
A TRUE ZEN MASTER.

40:14.418 --> 40:15.210
DEATH IS A PART OF LIFE.

40:17.960 --> 40:21.151
A TRANSITION,
A REBIRTH,

40:21.251 --> 40:23.316
SOMETHING THAT YOUR
YOUNG FRIENDS HERE

40:23.416 --> 40:26.415
HAVE LEARNED RECENTLY.

40:29.416 --> 40:32.524
YES...

40:32.624 --> 40:33.749
YENLO MUST BE
REBORN, TOO.

40:34.415 --> 40:36.874
IT IS THE NATURAL
ORDER OF THINGS.

40:42.290 --> 40:45.312
I LOVE YOU.

40:45.412 --> 40:47.372
AND I'LL ALWAYS
LOVE YOU, ANLING.

41:14.491 --> 41:18.225
DOES ANYONE KNOW
HOW TO LEAVE HERE?

41:18.325 --> 41:21.406
I THINK I KNOW
HOW TO DO IT NOW.

41:38.030 --> 41:41.512
SAINT JOHN'S WORT,
MEDICINAL HERB,

41:41.612 --> 41:43.303
RAGGED ROBIN,
MAGICAL HERB,

41:43.403 --> 41:46.301
CUPID'S DART,
STRICTLY AROMATIC.

41:46.401 --> 41:48.427
AND THAT ONE?

41:48.527 --> 41:50.053
THAT IS ANGELICA.

41:50.153 --> 41:51.843
AND ITS USE?

41:51.943 --> 41:53.400
UM, I THINK IT'S USED
MOSTLY TO FLAVOR FISH.

41:54.193 --> 41:56.401
SHE GOT EVERY ANSWER
RIGHT.

41:57.609 --> 41:59.717
Phoebe: YAY!

41:59.817 --> 42:01.342
SO, UH, WHAT INSPIRED
THE TURNAROUND?

42:01.442 --> 42:03.424
WELL, I KINDA LIKED
THE POWER BOOST
I HAD IN LIMBO,

42:03.524 --> 42:07.258
SO IT KINDA MADE ME
WANT TO WORK HARDER FASTER.

42:07.358 --> 42:09.882
WELL, DON'T BE
IN TOO BIG A HURRY.

42:09.982 --> 42:11.590
TRUST ME, YOU WANT
TO FIGHT LIKE HELL

42:11.690 --> 42:13.381
TO KEEP A LIFE
SEPARATE FROM MAGIC.

42:13.481 --> 42:15.215
HEAR! HEAR!

42:15.315 --> 42:16.547
AND HAVING A GUY
AROUND LIKE MASON

42:16.647 --> 42:18.964
IS NOT SUCH
A BAD THING.

42:19.064 --> 42:21.214
OH, YOU LIKED HIM?

42:21.314 --> 42:22.295
YEAH.

42:22.395 --> 42:23.463
YEAH, THAT'S TOO BAD.

42:23.563 --> 42:24.880
HE CANCELED ON ME
FOR TONIGHT.

42:24.980 --> 42:27.004
HE SAID I WAS TRYING TOO HARD

42:27.104 --> 42:29.213
AND THAT I WAS NOT
COMFORTABLE IN MY OWN SKIN.

42:29.313 --> 42:31.086
SO MUCH FOR IMPRESSING
THE BOSS, HUH?

42:31.186 --> 42:33.853
WELL, I CAN TAKE COMFORT
IN THE FACT THAT HE CANCELED
ON PHOEBE AND NOT ME.

42:34.061 --> 42:37.292
HA HA!
HEY!

42:37.392 --> 42:38.752
HA.

42:38.852 --> 42:40.435
HERE COMES YOUR
PERSONAL TRAINER
FROM HELL.

42:42.517 --> 42:44.334
LITERALLY.

42:44.434 --> 42:45.542
OOH, GOTTA GO.

42:45.642 --> 42:47.708
HI.

42:47.808 --> 42:49.390
WAIT A MINUTE.

42:50.225 --> 42:51.641
WHO ARE YOU?

42:54.891 --> 42:58.124
OHH, I KNOW.

42:58.224 --> 42:59.123
PAIGE.

42:59.223 --> 43:00.581
OH!

43:00.681 --> 43:01.931
SO WHAT'S ON OUR TRAINING
SCHEDULE FOR TODAY?

43:03.265 --> 43:05.206
LIGHT SABERS?

43:05.306 --> 43:06.287
ACTUALLY
I WAS THINKING

43:06.387 --> 43:07.592
MAYBE WE COULD HAVE
A PRIVATE PICNIC
OF OUR OWN.

43:07.602 --> 43:09.287
BUT WHAT ABOUT TRAINING?

43:09.387 --> 43:10.537
I HAVE TO BE READY
FOR THE SOURCE.

43:10.637 --> 43:13.121
I KNOW,
BUT NOT RIGHT NOW.

43:13.221 --> 43:14.496
RIGHT NOW I WAS
THINKING I COULD

43:14.596 --> 43:16.286
TAKE YOU TO THIS
GREAT LITTLE
PICNIC SPOT

43:16.386 --> 43:19.285
IN THE SOUTH OF FRANCE.

43:19.385 --> 43:21.368
REALLY?

43:21.468 --> 43:22.677
REALLY.
