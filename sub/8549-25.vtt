12:41.428 --> 12:43.396
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S WRONG
WITH THAT GIRL.

12:43.463 --> 12:47.334
YOU'RE A FINE YOUNG MAN AND
WOULD MAKE A WONDERFUL CATCH.

12:47.400 --> 12:51.771
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE I
SAID THAT TO MYSELF.

12:51.839 --> 12:53.306
BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK?

12:53.373 --> 12:55.742
SHOULD I USE THE TICKETS
TO GET YOUR GRANDDAUGHTER

12:55.809 --> 12:57.978
TO GO TO THE CONCERT WITH ME?

12:58.045 --> 13:00.814
STEVE, I KNOW THE KIND
OF PERSON YOU ARE,

13:00.881 --> 13:03.516
AND I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE

13:03.583 --> 13:07.054
THAT YOU'D EVER USE
BLACKMAIL.

13:07.120 --> 13:11.624
OH, I WAS AFRAID
YOU MIGHT SAY THAT.

13:11.691 --> 13:13.793
WELL, THERE GOES
MY DATE.

13:13.861 --> 13:16.529
OH, HONEY, GIVE HER TIME.
SHE'LL COME AROUND.

13:16.596 --> 13:18.765
I JUST HOPE SHE
FALLS IN LOVE WITH ME

13:18.832 --> 13:22.369
WHILE I'M STILL YOUNG ENOUGH
TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

13:24.171 --> 13:28.141
I WAS JUST THINKING THE SAME
THING ABOUT MR. FEBRUARY.

13:31.644 --> 13:33.013
ESTELLE!

13:33.080 --> 13:35.015
I MAY NOT ALWAYS
BE COOKING,

13:35.082 --> 13:38.485
BUT MY PILOT LIGHT
IS ALWAYS ON.

13:38.551 --> 13:41.088
HEH HEH HEH!

14:11.751 --> 14:13.887
UM...

14:14.922 --> 14:16.256
MR. MALLORY...

14:18.025 --> 14:20.260
MY NAME IS CARL WINSLOW.

14:22.029 --> 14:25.865
AND I'M A POLICE OFFICER.

14:25.933 --> 14:28.568
WELL, ACTUALLY, I GUESS
YOU KNOW WHO I AM.

14:32.005 --> 14:33.974
BUT I CAME HERE TODAY
TO GET SOMETHING

14:34.041 --> 14:38.445
OFF MY CHEST, MR. MALLORY.

14:38.511 --> 14:44.952
YOU KNOW, WHAT HAPPENED,
HAPPENED A YEAR AGO.

14:45.018 --> 14:47.988
BUT WHAT HAPPENED
HAPPENS AGAIN AND AGAIN

14:48.055 --> 14:50.057
IN MY MIND.

14:52.559 --> 14:55.228
I CLOSE MY EYES,
AND I...

14:58.765 --> 15:02.602
I SEE THAT MAN
HOLDING YOU.

15:10.577 --> 15:12.179
I SEE THAT...

15:12.245 --> 15:16.483
THAT GUN...PRESSED
AGAINST YOUR HEAD.

15:19.886 --> 15:22.255
AND I SEE THE FEAR
ON YOUR FACE.

15:27.995 --> 15:32.165
BUT WHAT I DON'T SEE,
MR. MALLORY,

15:32.232 --> 15:34.601
IS THAT ONE SECOND,
THAT ONE...

15:34.667 --> 15:35.835
FRACTION OF A SECOND

15:35.902 --> 15:38.471
WHEN I COULD HAVE
TAKEN HIM DOWN.

15:41.374 --> 15:44.944
IT WAS THERE.
IT--IT HAD TO BE THERE.

15:45.012 --> 15:49.416
IF ONLY I HAD SEEN IT
AND DONE SOMETHING,

15:49.482 --> 15:53.253
YOU MIGHT BE ALIVE
TODAY, MR. MALLORY.

15:56.456 --> 15:59.092
BUT I MISSED.

16:01.161 --> 16:03.630
AND I JUST WANT TO SAY...

16:05.098 --> 16:08.535
THAT I'M SO SORRY,
MR. MALLORY.

16:08.601 --> 16:11.604
I AM SO VERY SORRY.

16:20.780 --> 16:22.682
OFFICER?

16:23.950 --> 16:25.618
UH, YES.

16:26.619 --> 16:28.888
I'M HELEN MALLORY.

16:28.955 --> 16:30.990
CHARLES
WAS MY HUSBAND.

16:31.058 --> 16:33.826
OH, MRS. MALLORY.

16:33.893 --> 16:37.030
LET'S SIT A MOMENT.

16:46.139 --> 16:49.876
I SHOULD APOLOGIZE
FOR LISTENING TO YOU.

16:49.942 --> 16:51.944
NO, THAT'S ALRIGHT.

16:52.011 --> 16:53.646
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

16:53.713 --> 16:55.014
OH, SURE.

16:55.082 --> 16:58.285
DO YOU EVER
ASK YOURSELF

16:58.351 --> 17:00.953
WHY YOU HAD TO BE
THE POLICEMAN

17:01.020 --> 17:03.523
WHO GOT THERE FIRST?

17:05.458 --> 17:08.295
MRS. MALLORY,
I ASK MYSELF THAT QUESTION

17:08.361 --> 17:10.430
A MILLION TIMES
A DAY.

17:12.965 --> 17:15.168
BUT I GUESS
YOU ASK YOURSELF

17:15.235 --> 17:19.372
WHY YOUR HUSBAND WAS
THE ONE TO BE THERE THAT NIGHT.

17:19.439 --> 17:21.241
NO, I DON'T.

17:21.308 --> 17:25.478
HE WAS THERE BECAUSE
I ASKED HIM TO GO.

17:26.879 --> 17:28.715
WE WERE HOME
WATCHING TELEVISION,

17:28.781 --> 17:32.185
AND I MENTIONED THAT
I WANTED SOME ICE CREAM,

17:32.252 --> 17:35.455
SO CHARLES SAID HE'D
DASH TO THE STORE.

17:35.522 --> 17:37.290
SO HE GOT UP,

17:37.357 --> 17:40.927
CUSSED THE DOG FOR
CHEWING ON HIS HAT,

17:40.993 --> 17:42.362
AND...

17:45.132 --> 17:48.101
LEFT MY LIFE FOREVER.

17:50.103 --> 17:53.540
FOR A LONG, LONG TIME,

17:53.606 --> 17:58.711
I FOUND IT DIFFICULT

17:58.778 --> 18:01.281
TO LIVE WITH THE FACT THAT

18:01.348 --> 18:03.516
IF I HADN'T
ASKED CHARLES TO GO

18:03.583 --> 18:06.018
TO THAT STORE,

18:06.085 --> 18:09.088
HE WOULD STILL
BE WITH ME.

18:10.457 --> 18:14.927
OH, BUT, MRS. MALLORY,
THERE WAS NO POSSIBLE WAY

18:14.994 --> 18:16.763
YOU COULD HAVE KNOWN
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN.

18:16.829 --> 18:19.766
IT--IT WASN'T YOUR FAULT.

18:19.832 --> 18:21.768
OH, I KNOW,

18:21.834 --> 18:25.705
BUT IT TOOK ME A LONG TIME
TO REALIZE THAT.

18:25.772 --> 18:28.575
AND NOW...

18:28.641 --> 18:30.943
YOU MUST REALIZE

18:31.010 --> 18:33.213
THAT IT'S NOT
YOUR FAULT, EITHER.

18:35.148 --> 18:37.184
OKAY?

18:38.718 --> 18:40.453
OKAY.

19:15.188 --> 19:16.923
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

19:16.989 --> 19:20.527
I'M DEFINITELY GONNA HAVE
TO HAVE A LONG TALK WITH LAURA.

19:20.593 --> 19:22.962
WHY?

19:23.029 --> 19:24.531
LOOK WHAT I FOUND!

19:24.597 --> 19:26.233
A HUNK-OF-THE-MONTH CALENDAR.

19:26.299 --> 19:30.403
OH-UH, NO, WELL, NOW--

19:30.470 --> 19:33.706
UH, DON'T BE TOO HARD ON HER.

19:33.773 --> 19:35.508
IT'S JUST A PHASE.

19:37.344 --> 19:38.811
HI, EVERYBODY.

19:38.878 --> 19:41.514
HI, SWEETIE.

19:41.581 --> 19:43.350
CARL, YOU'RE
IN A GREAT MOOD.

19:43.416 --> 19:46.853
YES. I FEEL BETTER
THAN I HAVE IN A VERY LONG TIME.

19:46.919 --> 19:48.087
REALLY? WHAT HAPPENED?
YUP.

19:48.154 --> 19:49.722
WELL, I'LL EXPLAIN LATER.

19:49.789 --> 19:52.359
BUT RIGHT NOW, I WANT
TO APOLOGIZE TO EVERYBODY

19:52.425 --> 19:53.693
FOR MY BEHAVIOR LATELY,

19:53.760 --> 19:56.396
AND I WANT TO MAKE IT
UP TO YOU, SO

19:56.463 --> 19:59.799
LET'S ALL GO OUT FOR DINNER
AND A MOVIE, HUH?

19:59.866 --> 20:01.434
-OH, IT'D BE GREAT.
-SOUNDS GOOD.

20:01.501 --> 20:03.470
GOOD. I'M SO EXCITED.

20:03.536 --> 20:05.438
SWEETHEART,
WHERE'S THE PAPER?

20:05.505 --> 20:08.275
IN THE KITCHEN
HIDING FROM YOU.

20:13.179 --> 20:15.282
YES, LORD!

20:18.150 --> 20:21.187
CONGRATULATIONS,
WINSLOWS.

20:21.254 --> 20:23.623
I'M HERE.

20:23.690 --> 20:25.024
EVENING, STEVE.

20:25.091 --> 20:28.495
OH, HELLO, ESTELLE.

20:28.561 --> 20:30.129
ONCE AGAIN,
YOUR ASTOUNDING BEAUTY

20:30.196 --> 20:34.267
HAS SNUCK UP BEHIND ME
AND CLUBBED ME SENSELESS.

20:34.334 --> 20:36.836
THANK YOU,
SWEET-TALKER YOU.

20:36.903 --> 20:38.705
STEVE, WHY AREN'T
YOU DRESSED?

20:38.771 --> 20:40.673
WE'LL BE LATE
FOR THE CONCERT.

20:40.740 --> 20:43.976
OH, MAMA!

20:44.043 --> 20:47.947
WHOA, LAURA, YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.
YOU'RE GORGEOUS.

20:48.014 --> 20:50.783
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE
REST OF YOUR PANTS?

20:53.920 --> 20:59.258
OH, WELL, I'M AFRAID
I'M NOT GOING, CUDDLELIPS.

20:59.326 --> 21:01.761
HERE. TAKE MAXINE
WITH YOU.

21:01.828 --> 21:02.895
REALLY?

21:02.962 --> 21:03.930
YEAH.

21:03.996 --> 21:05.332
GREAT!

21:07.934 --> 21:09.969
WHY?

21:10.036 --> 21:12.204
WELL, I'M TOO BIG
A MAN

21:12.271 --> 21:14.040
TO TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF YOUR UNSEEMLY LUST

21:14.106 --> 21:18.110
FOR A PROGNATHOUS
POP STAR.

21:18.177 --> 21:19.812
STEVE, I'M NOT SURE
WHAT YOU SAID,

21:19.879 --> 21:22.248
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE
LETTING ME OFF THE HOOK.

21:22.315 --> 21:25.485
THANKS, STEVE!
I'LL JUST CALL MAXINE.

21:29.288 --> 21:31.591
WAIT A MINUTE.

21:31.658 --> 21:33.292
-WHY?
-THIS IS A TRICK.

21:33.360 --> 21:34.927
WELL, WHATEVER
DO YOU MEAN?

21:34.994 --> 21:38.865
STEVE, IF I TAKE THESE TICKETS,
I'LL OWE YOU, I'LL OWE YOU BIG.

21:38.931 --> 21:40.933
YOU'RE SNEAKY ENOUGH
TO USE THAT ADVANTAGE

21:41.000 --> 21:43.169
TO MAKE ME GO OUT
WITH YOU LATER.

21:43.235 --> 21:45.738
WELL, I'M NOT FALLING
FOR IT.

21:45.805 --> 21:47.374
BUT, TURTLEDOVE--

21:47.440 --> 21:49.576
FORGET IT, STEVE.
YOU'RE DATING ME TONIGHT.

21:49.642 --> 21:52.645
COME ON, LET'S GO OVER TO YOUR
HOUSE AND GET YOU READY.

21:52.712 --> 21:56.549
WELL, OKAY.
IF YOU INSIST.

21:58.918 --> 22:02.455
ESTELLE, THANK YOU
FOR THE ADVICE.

22:02.522 --> 22:04.090
HOW CAN I
EVER THANK YOU?

22:04.156 --> 22:05.958
BRING ME
A JOHNNY GILL T-SHIRT.

22:06.025 --> 22:08.395
OH, YOU GOT IT.

22:08.461 --> 22:09.962
NOW, HAVE A GOOD TIME.

22:10.029 --> 22:12.699
GOOD? IT'LL BE MAGNIFICENT.

22:21.007 --> 22:23.109
EXCUSE ME.
