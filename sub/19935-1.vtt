00:35.602 --> 00:39.071
Far, far from land, where the waters are

00:39.073 --> 00:42.708
as clear as glass, there,
where no anchor can reach

00:42.710 --> 00:45.510
the bottom, live the mer-people.

00:47.747 --> 00:49.848
We do not have immortal souls.

00:49.850 --> 00:52.884
When we die, we shall
never rise again.

00:52.886 --> 00:56.421
But you, you have a soul
that lives eternally.

00:56.423 --> 00:58.890
As we rise up through the
waters to look at the world of

00:58.892 --> 01:02.995
man, your soul rises up to the
unknown, the beautiful world,

01:02.997 --> 01:05.430
that we shall never see.

01:05.432 --> 01:07.599
But I wanted to see that world.

01:07.601 --> 01:11.103
So I went to the sea witch,
and she mixed me a potion.

01:11.105 --> 01:13.572
"Drink it before the
sun rises," she said.

01:13.574 --> 01:15.874
"Your tail will divide and
shrink, until it becomes

01:15.876 --> 01:19.511
what human beings
call 'pretty legs'.

01:19.513 --> 01:22.481
But every time your foot
touches the ground it

01:22.483 --> 01:25.751
will feel as though you were
walking on knives so sharp that

01:25.753 --> 01:27.753
your blood must flow.

01:27.755 --> 01:30.589
If you cannot make him fall
so much in love with you that

01:30.591 --> 01:33.392
he forgets both his father
and mother, because his every

01:33.394 --> 01:36.328
thought concerns only you,
the first morning after

01:36.330 --> 01:39.164
he has loved another, your
heart will break and you will

01:39.166 --> 01:41.566
become foam on the ocean."

01:41.568 --> 01:45.370
She took my voice as
payment for the potion.

01:46.239 --> 01:48.974
That's the price for true love.

02:49.168 --> 02:50.402
- Are you okay?

02:54.207 --> 02:57.008
Have a little too much to drink?

03:02.215 --> 03:05.484
Yeah, they all got clothes on.

03:05.486 --> 03:09.788
Let's get you inside and
find you something to wear.

04:48.488 --> 04:50.222
You're smokin' hot.

04:51.557 --> 04:54.392
I figured you were
about Jamie's size.

04:54.394 --> 04:56.862
Oh, Jamie is Everett's sister.

04:56.864 --> 04:58.763
You don't know Jamie?

05:07.940 --> 05:08.907
Hey, wait!

05:13.779 --> 05:15.080
What the hell?

05:19.418 --> 05:21.553
- Do I know you?

05:21.555 --> 05:23.121
- Oh hey Everett.

05:23.123 --> 05:26.691
- Carter, you wanna
introduce me to your friend.

05:26.693 --> 05:28.660
- She's not my friend.

05:29.395 --> 05:30.962
- Okay.

05:31.731 --> 05:33.865
- Let's get you a drink.

06:18.544 --> 06:20.812
The world of man is cruel.

06:20.814 --> 06:22.914
This is not what I expected.

06:22.916 --> 06:27.218
What kind of man would live
in a world such as this?

06:56.983 --> 06:58.416
- Don't go babe.

06:58.418 --> 07:01.786
- I'm sorry, my husband
comes home tonight.

07:01.788 --> 07:04.623
I had fun this weekend though.

07:04.625 --> 07:06.925
- Wanna come inside
for one last round?

07:06.927 --> 07:09.894
- I know what one last
round means, I have to go.

08:10.423 --> 08:13.324
- Hey, weird girl,
where are you?

08:17.363 --> 08:19.330
Come on, party's over.

08:38.650 --> 08:39.951
Do I know you?

08:51.230 --> 08:52.630
I need a drink.

08:53.566 --> 08:55.467
And you need a drink.

08:57.603 --> 08:58.570
Come on.

09:14.320 --> 09:16.454
What do you wanna drink?

09:18.624 --> 09:21.493
Oh, that's right,
you don't talk.

09:22.795 --> 09:27.065
Really scrapin' the bottom
of the barrel with this one.

09:33.406 --> 09:37.709
More of a
wine girl, I see.

09:57.296 --> 10:00.431
Are you sure you
don't wanna get in?

10:01.400 --> 10:03.935
Probably can't swim, anyways.

10:14.146 --> 10:16.514
Wanna go do somethin' else?

10:18.884 --> 10:19.818
Come on.

10:32.432 --> 10:33.498
Yeah, nice.

10:57.823 --> 10:59.791
Oh, you're still here.

11:00.826 --> 11:02.827
Persistent, aren't you?

11:07.800 --> 11:10.368
You wanna eat some breakfast?

11:13.072 --> 11:16.374
Okay, I'll get you some clothes.

11:16.376 --> 11:17.976
Take a shower, too.

11:17.978 --> 11:19.711
You look like shit.

11:41.333 --> 11:42.367
- All done?

11:42.369 --> 11:43.501
- Yes ma'am.

11:47.039 --> 11:48.840
- Can I get you anything else?

11:48.842 --> 11:50.208
You sure, I can get
you something El--

11:50.210 --> 11:52.744
- she doesn't want
anything, thank you.

11:52.746 --> 11:56.781
- Alright, let me know
if you change your mind.

12:02.688 --> 12:04.589
- Why don't you talk?

12:06.492 --> 12:08.593
Maybe your name, let's try that.

12:08.595 --> 12:11.229
Repeat after me, "my name is."

12:17.403 --> 12:19.804
- Can I get you
two some dessert?

12:19.806 --> 12:21.339
- Where's your restrooms?

12:21.341 --> 12:23.374
- Oh, right back there.

12:29.715 --> 12:30.949
- Let him go.

12:35.754 --> 12:38.222
- What's your name, sweetie?

12:40.025 --> 12:41.326
Can you speak?

12:43.395 --> 12:45.863
Do you have somewhere to go?

12:48.567 --> 12:50.201
Here, you take it.

12:53.672 --> 12:56.040
You need it more than I do.

13:01.180 --> 13:02.380
Are you okay?

13:08.053 --> 13:09.787
I'll be right back.

13:42.321 --> 13:44.856
Come on, I have a
place for you to stay.

13:44.858 --> 13:47.225
No, don't worry
about him, alright?

13:47.227 --> 13:51.029
Come on, I've only got
30 minutes, let's go.

13:53.632 --> 13:54.599
- How
are you, ladies?

13:54.601 --> 13:55.767
- Hey, we're fine, and yourself?

13:55.769 --> 13:57.935
- Good, just on my way to work.

13:57.937 --> 13:59.203
- You guys live here now?

13:59.205 --> 14:00.505
I thought that...

14:00.507 --> 14:01.739
- She's just staying
here for a few days.

14:01.741 --> 14:03.274
- I gotcha, guess I'll
see you around then.

14:03.276 --> 14:04.108
- Alright.

14:04.110 --> 14:04.942
- Tell Jax I said hi.

14:04.944 --> 14:06.411
- Yeah, I will.

14:06.413 --> 14:09.280
See, I told you
it was safe here.

14:17.356 --> 14:19.157
Oh wow, what a mess.

14:20.492 --> 14:24.796
He's not home right now, so
just make yourself at home.

14:30.135 --> 14:32.103
You'll be fine.

14:32.105 --> 14:34.405
Look, I'm gonna write down
my number, just in case

14:34.407 --> 14:36.541
you need anything, okay?

14:39.778 --> 14:42.547
Not that you'll be able to call.

14:42.549 --> 14:44.048
I'll put the address down
just in case you need

14:44.050 --> 14:45.450
to go anywhere.

14:48.921 --> 14:52.123
Now, there's food in the
fridge, and junk on the TV.

14:52.125 --> 14:53.791
I've got to head
back to the diner.

14:53.793 --> 14:55.660
You're gonna be okay.

14:58.097 --> 15:02.333
I'll come back and check on
you in a couple of days, okay?

17:45.664 --> 17:48.065
- hey, Roxanne, interested?

17:48.934 --> 17:50.167
- Definitely.

17:59.544 --> 18:03.080
- Hey, you still
have to pay for that.

18:03.082 --> 18:04.448
- Pay for what?

18:07.219 --> 18:08.452
- Never mind.

18:12.891 --> 18:14.825
Hey, who's the new girl?

18:14.827 --> 18:15.660
- What?

18:15.662 --> 18:16.627
Who?

18:17.929 --> 18:19.063
Not my girl.

18:20.165 --> 18:21.632
- She should be.

18:22.834 --> 18:24.035
Okay, Pedro.

18:24.037 --> 18:27.071
Close your mouth before
the drool comes out.

18:27.073 --> 18:29.874
- It's Pedro, my name
is pronounced peh-dro.

18:29.876 --> 18:32.677
- That's nice, get back to work.

18:44.022 --> 18:45.890
She's a great dancer.

18:47.426 --> 18:48.392
- Hey.

18:51.063 --> 18:53.230
- Are you lookin' for
a job, or a lapdance?

18:53.232 --> 18:56.067
- Judging by your reaction,
lack of cash, and the fact that

18:56.069 --> 18:58.703
you have boobs, I'd say job.

18:58.705 --> 19:00.004
Can you dance?

19:03.575 --> 19:05.276
- Hey, what's going on?

19:05.278 --> 19:06.911
- She wants a job.

19:08.313 --> 19:09.347
- Hey, sky.

19:15.454 --> 19:17.722
- She doesn't talk much.

19:17.724 --> 19:19.090
- Can you talk?

19:21.593 --> 19:23.928
Well, we've had weirder.

19:23.930 --> 19:27.665
I can show her the ropes
and we see what she's got.

19:27.667 --> 19:30.201
- She'll need new clothes.

19:30.203 --> 19:32.169
- I can take her
shopping when I get done,

19:32.171 --> 19:33.637
before I go my meeting.

19:33.639 --> 19:35.172
- Just be sure
you make it to that meeting.

19:35.174 --> 19:36.741
- I will, I will.

19:39.912 --> 19:41.512
Hey, I gotta go.

19:41.514 --> 19:42.513
See you tomorrow.

19:42.515 --> 19:43.481
Okay, bye.

19:43.483 --> 19:46.817
- So you need new clothes,
sky's gonna come get you later,

19:46.819 --> 19:48.052
take you shopping.

19:48.054 --> 19:49.587
Just leave your address
at the bar, okay?

19:49.589 --> 19:51.155
See you tomorrow.

20:23.156 --> 20:25.122
- Sorry, I was just...

20:27.025 --> 20:28.259
There is no good excuse.

20:28.261 --> 20:31.796
I just wanted to take
your picture, so...

20:36.468 --> 20:39.537
- Sorry I was late, I was
taking pictures of dogs

20:39.539 --> 20:41.539
at the dog pound.

20:41.541 --> 20:44.909
And they had more
than I thought, so...

20:47.813 --> 20:50.047
You wanna get some pizza?

20:53.318 --> 20:55.586
Pizza, you know what pizza is?

20:55.588 --> 20:57.254
You don't know what pizza is?

20:57.256 --> 20:59.757
What are you, a dancer
or a model or something?

20:59.759 --> 21:03.594
I mean you've got the
body, but at what cost?

21:07.599 --> 21:11.068
Okay, come on, we gotta
show you what pizza is.

21:24.182 --> 21:25.483
Are you ready?

21:29.621 --> 21:30.921
Behold, pizza.

21:34.259 --> 21:36.293
Go ahead, take a piece.

21:38.797 --> 21:40.598
Okay, I'll show you.

21:42.334 --> 21:43.300
Like this.

21:46.705 --> 21:48.072
It's delicious.

21:58.550 --> 22:00.017
Bigger, come on.

22:01.620 --> 22:04.688
See, there you go,
it's good, yeah?

22:10.228 --> 22:11.862
No, woah, hey, no.

22:23.141 --> 22:25.943
- Do I know you from somewhere?

22:25.945 --> 22:28.345
- I don't think
so, can I help you?

22:28.347 --> 22:33.183
- Yeah, I'm here for, well,
i don't know her name,

22:33.185 --> 22:34.818
but mute girl?

22:34.820 --> 22:36.554
- Oh, right, come on in.

22:36.556 --> 22:37.922
- Thanks.

22:39.024 --> 22:40.190
- Do you know her?

22:40.192 --> 22:41.692
- Hey.

22:41.694 --> 22:44.662
I work at the club, I'm
here to take you shopping?

22:44.664 --> 22:47.798
Don't worry, I'll
have her home soon.

22:47.800 --> 22:48.766
- Hold on.

22:50.068 --> 22:51.035
- Hey.

22:55.340 --> 22:57.241
- Here, just in case.

23:04.783 --> 23:06.417
- Okay, bye.

23:22.901 --> 23:23.867
What?

23:24.936 --> 23:27.771
You've never seen
a sex toy before?

23:28.707 --> 23:29.673
Come on.

23:36.514 --> 23:38.816
Oh my god, you would
look so good in this.

23:38.818 --> 23:40.250
What size are you?

23:40.252 --> 23:41.885
Probably a four.

23:41.887 --> 23:43.354
There's no way
we're the same size.

23:43.356 --> 23:45.322
Don't worry, you'll
lose some weight.

23:45.324 --> 23:47.791
Oh my god, look at that one.

23:57.736 --> 24:02.239
I know you expect us to be
bff's but it's not gonna happen.

24:02.241 --> 24:06.543
I had fun, but I'd just
prefer to not make it a habit.

24:07.612 --> 24:08.912
Don't take it personal,
i just don't like to get

24:08.914 --> 24:10.214
too close to anybody.

24:10.216 --> 24:12.583
People always let you down.

24:13.885 --> 24:15.119
You want one?

24:26.598 --> 24:28.565
- Hey, how much?

24:28.567 --> 24:32.436
- Like you can afford
it, keep going asshole!

24:34.472 --> 24:35.973
Don't worry about that,
you'll get used to it workin'

24:35.975 --> 24:37.107
at the club.

24:39.210 --> 24:41.512
So where you from, anyway?

24:43.615 --> 24:45.582
I get it, you don't
have to tell me.

24:45.584 --> 24:49.887
I like to keep my personal
life close to the vest, too.

24:49.889 --> 24:51.855
You seem nice, though.

24:53.892 --> 24:55.526
Come on, let's go.

25:08.206 --> 25:10.374
- Gimme all your cash.

25:10.376 --> 25:11.642
- We don't have any cash.

25:11.644 --> 25:13.644
- Bull shit, y'all strippers.

25:13.646 --> 25:15.145
You got cash.

25:15.147 --> 25:19.049
Okay, okay, okay, it's in
my purse, over by the bags.

25:22.654 --> 25:26.023
Piece of shit, trying
to rob two little girls.

25:26.025 --> 25:26.857
- Ow.

25:26.859 --> 25:27.891
- You okay?

25:32.430 --> 25:34.531
Okay, okay, let's go.

25:34.533 --> 25:36.233
I gotta get you out of here.

25:36.235 --> 25:37.167
Come on, let's go.

25:37.169 --> 25:39.136
I got somewhere to be.

25:53.084 --> 25:54.051
- Hello?

25:56.154 --> 25:57.554
Somebody there?

25:59.791 --> 26:00.758
Oh, right.

26:12.036 --> 26:13.337
Hey, have fun?

26:15.373 --> 26:17.708
You're probably
pretty tired, huh?

26:17.710 --> 26:20.711
Well, I've got a clean
towel in my bedroom.

26:20.713 --> 26:25.682
I've got my stuff on the couch,
so you're more than welcome.

26:25.684 --> 26:28.619
Also, I've got got a
meeting tonight, I shouldn't

26:28.621 --> 26:30.521
be very long, though.

26:32.690 --> 26:34.324
No, I'll stay on the couch.

26:34.326 --> 26:37.227
I stay on there 75%
of the time anyway.

26:37.229 --> 26:39.730
You can take the bedroom.

26:39.732 --> 26:40.697
Come on.

26:48.706 --> 26:50.274
Well, this is it.

26:57.849 --> 26:58.916
Good night.

27:38.857 --> 27:40.424
- Hey.

27:40.426 --> 27:41.925
- Oh, hey.

27:41.927 --> 27:43.994
- I knew I knew
you from somewhere.

27:43.996 --> 27:45.829
- You got another one of those?

27:45.831 --> 27:47.130
- You're late.

27:47.866 --> 27:50.634
- You're not exactly on time.

27:50.636 --> 27:51.835
- What group?

27:52.770 --> 27:56.673
- Aren't these supposed
to be anonymous?

27:56.675 --> 27:57.975
Aa, I'm in aa.

28:01.045 --> 28:03.080
- Narcotics, two years.

28:05.516 --> 28:08.185
- Well, I better get inside.

28:08.187 --> 28:09.920
- Hey, wanna ditch?

28:12.624 --> 28:14.258
- Maybe next time.

28:43.521 --> 28:45.022
Hey.

28:45.024 --> 28:49.226
I'm about to leave, but i
made you some breakfast.

28:51.396 --> 28:52.863
How'd you sleep?

28:53.932 --> 28:55.465
Oh, right, cool.

28:56.601 --> 28:59.903
I gotta go, but you
got plans tonight?

29:03.408 --> 29:06.009
You wanna go do something?

29:06.011 --> 29:10.314
Not like a date, or anything,
just like a hangout or...

29:13.217 --> 29:14.251
Okay, cool.

29:16.421 --> 29:19.957
Well, I gotta go, but I'll
be back at like, six-ish

29:19.959 --> 29:22.926
or something, so,
okay, okay, bye.

30:49.313 --> 30:50.280
- Not bad.

30:51.382 --> 30:55.185
You still have some
work to do, but not bad.

30:56.154 --> 30:58.121
- So you start tonight,
and you're go--

30:58.123 --> 31:00.824
oh, you have plans or something?

31:00.826 --> 31:02.392
Fine, take tonight off.

31:02.394 --> 31:05.729
You start tomorrow night,
does that work for you?

31:05.731 --> 31:06.997
Okay.

31:06.999 --> 31:08.231
Catch her up on what she
needs to know, then get

31:08.233 --> 31:09.433
ready for tonight.

31:09.435 --> 31:11.168
- Alright, come on.

31:44.202 --> 31:47.070
- Oh, I see you
found my clothes.

31:48.339 --> 31:49.806
And you cleaned.

31:54.312 --> 31:56.246
- I got you this, for tonight.

31:56.248 --> 31:58.615
I know you don't have much.

32:06.791 --> 32:09.593
- Well, I'm gonna go change, so.

32:35.753 --> 32:36.720
Wow.

32:37.555 --> 32:38.522
You ready?

32:57.808 --> 33:01.044
sorry, you don't
care about that.

33:01.046 --> 33:05.482
I just, you don't really
talk a whole lot, so I'm just

33:05.484 --> 33:06.716
rambling and.

33:16.527 --> 33:20.664
So have you been mute
your whole life, or is it?

33:55.733 --> 33:59.369
I'm not really the
most photogenic person.

34:01.772 --> 34:06.009
I'm more of like a
behind-the-camera kind of guy.

34:31.303 --> 34:33.370
they're beautiful, huh?

34:40.078 --> 34:41.777
where are you from?

35:49.880 --> 35:53.416
- if he's not into
you, then move on.

35:53.418 --> 35:55.485
I mean, look at you,
you have guys lining

35:55.487 --> 35:57.554
down the block for you.

35:59.323 --> 36:00.457
What?

36:00.459 --> 36:01.691
He's not here.

36:02.993 --> 36:06.896
You're gorgeous, if he doesn't
like you, he's probably gay.

36:06.898 --> 36:07.964
You kissed?

36:08.833 --> 36:11.334
Okay, then what's the big deal?

36:14.572 --> 36:15.538
What?

36:18.676 --> 36:19.843
Girl, I get it.

36:19.845 --> 36:22.078
Listen, I'm not for love.

36:23.347 --> 36:26.516
But if I were a normal
person, I'd tell you

36:26.518 --> 36:30.153
not every guy is the same,
and to get back in there.

36:30.155 --> 36:33.089
Now come on, let's go
dance this out and get some

36:33.091 --> 36:34.991
of your dignity back.

40:25.991 --> 40:27.023
Just a sec.

40:31.895 --> 40:32.695
Hey!

40:32.697 --> 40:35.131
What are you doing here?

40:35.133 --> 40:36.766
- I was in the neighborhood
and thought I'd swing

40:36.768 --> 40:38.401
by and check on...

40:39.803 --> 40:41.337
- Oh, she's not here.

40:41.339 --> 40:42.405
- Oh, okay.

40:43.507 --> 40:44.474
So how's it going?

40:44.476 --> 40:45.842
Is she like, super weird?

40:45.844 --> 40:49.412
- No, she's
actually pretty cool.

40:49.414 --> 40:51.581
- Oh, well that's good.

40:51.583 --> 40:53.049
- Yeah, she's...

40:53.851 --> 40:56.753
I don't know, she's different?

40:56.755 --> 40:59.522
I don't really know
how to explain it.

40:59.524 --> 41:02.759
- Well, you're
busy, I should go.

41:02.761 --> 41:04.060
- You okay?

41:04.062 --> 41:05.561
I've got a few minutes,
we can go grab a

41:05.563 --> 41:07.130
coffee or something.

41:07.132 --> 41:10.166
- No, I should be getting
ready for work anyways.

41:10.168 --> 41:11.000
- You sure?

41:11.002 --> 41:11.934
- Yeah.

41:11.936 --> 41:12.869
- Okay.

41:12.871 --> 41:13.970
Alright well, love you dude.

41:13.972 --> 41:15.371
- Love you too.

41:58.382 --> 42:00.450
- Your friends stopped by.

42:00.452 --> 42:02.051
- It's so good to see you.

42:05.356 --> 42:06.656
Don't look so
frightened, darling.

42:06.658 --> 42:08.224
Just checking in.

42:08.226 --> 42:09.859
It's been forever.

42:11.361 --> 42:15.665
- I told her she could stay
for dinner, I hope that's okay.

42:30.814 --> 42:31.948
- He's nice.

42:32.983 --> 42:35.718
Look, our deal was for Everett.

42:36.787 --> 42:38.588
To make things a little
interesting, I'll switch

42:38.590 --> 42:39.555
it to Jax.

42:40.357 --> 42:41.991
Do we have a deal?

42:44.461 --> 42:47.063
I will not make
this offer twice.

42:47.065 --> 42:50.399
You can say no and I'll
take you back to sea now.

42:50.401 --> 42:53.202
Of course you still won't
have your voice, but you'll

42:53.204 --> 42:55.238
be with your father and sisters.

42:55.240 --> 42:57.373
They do miss you dearly.

43:01.512 --> 43:03.412
It's not what you thought
it would be, is it?

43:03.414 --> 43:06.582
The human world,
it's a cruel place.

43:06.584 --> 43:10.386
The way they treat one
another, it's disgusting,

43:10.388 --> 43:13.189
and that's coming from me.

43:13.191 --> 43:15.324
Poor souls, unfortunate.

43:24.001 --> 43:24.967
Alright.

43:36.647 --> 43:38.214
- Dinner's ready.

43:40.984 --> 43:43.352
- So, what do you do?

43:43.354 --> 43:44.854
- I'm in the music industry.

43:44.856 --> 43:46.556
- Oh, a singer.

43:46.558 --> 43:49.826
- No, more
like a collector of voices.

43:49.828 --> 43:52.295
- So, like a music producer?

43:54.331 --> 43:56.399
- Something like that.

43:56.401 --> 43:58.367
What is it what you do?

43:58.369 --> 44:00.837
- I'm a photographer.

44:00.839 --> 44:02.905
- Would you like some wine?

44:02.907 --> 44:04.307
- No, you ladies go ahead.

44:04.309 --> 44:07.009
I'm not much of a wine drinker.

44:08.045 --> 44:09.912
- Just try a sip.

44:09.914 --> 44:10.980
- Music, huh?

44:10.982 --> 44:12.215
That's interesting.

44:12.217 --> 44:14.483
- And
what do you do?

44:14.485 --> 44:16.519
- I work with her.

44:16.521 --> 44:19.121
- And what do you
two do, exactly?

44:19.123 --> 44:22.491
- Yeah, I've kind of been
wondering the same thing.

44:22.493 --> 44:24.327
- We're dancers at quixotic.

44:26.130 --> 44:28.197
- Sorry, I had no idea.

44:29.800 --> 44:33.202
- Really, the
clothes didn't tip you off?

44:33.204 --> 44:36.472
- I guess I really
didn't think about it.

44:36.474 --> 44:37.573
- She does quite well.

44:37.575 --> 44:39.375
She has quite a few fans.

44:39.377 --> 44:41.177
- I'm sure she does.

44:50.387 --> 44:54.290
- You don't have to dance,
if you don't want to.

44:54.292 --> 44:57.660
I can help you with money,
or whatever, until you can

44:57.662 --> 44:59.462
find something else.

45:00.764 --> 45:03.666
Well, if that's
what you wanna do.

45:05.402 --> 45:08.771
- What are you two
whispering about?

45:08.773 --> 45:10.539
Well, what are you
whispering about?

45:10.541 --> 45:12.041
She's not much of talker.

45:12.043 --> 45:13.676
- Just work stuff.

45:16.113 --> 45:17.613
- Guess it's about
time I've head out.

45:17.615 --> 45:19.916
Get back to the ole whore
house, get some practice in.

45:19.918 --> 45:21.384
See ya tomorrow.

45:22.586 --> 45:23.586
- I don't think that--

45:23.588 --> 45:24.787
- You know
what, it's okay.

45:24.789 --> 45:28.457
I know what you think,
and I don't care.

45:28.459 --> 45:30.927
- I'm right behind you.

45:30.929 --> 45:34.230
Well, thank you for
the lovely dinner.

45:37.634 --> 45:40.703
I'll be seeing you
again, real son.

45:42.773 --> 45:44.573
I'll see myself out.

45:48.578 --> 45:50.446
- Well, that was fun.

45:55.752 --> 45:57.954
I'm gonna go take a bath.

50:15.880 --> 50:17.479
- Didn't know I had an audience.

50:17.481 --> 50:21.784
- You should always dance
like you have an audience.

50:33.330 --> 50:34.563
To the dance.

50:35.465 --> 50:37.299
You have talent.

50:37.301 --> 50:40.035
- Thanks.

50:40.037 --> 50:41.670
- No, I'm serious.

50:42.939 --> 50:44.473
Can you stop for one second?

50:44.475 --> 50:48.010
I'm trying to be real
with you right now.

50:50.313 --> 50:52.581
Maybe this is a way
for you to get out.

50:52.583 --> 50:55.217
- Get out of what,
a steady paycheck?

50:55.219 --> 50:57.219
- You're not gonna be
young and hot forever.

50:57.221 --> 50:59.521
- Yeah, thanks for that
little Pearl of wisdom.

50:59.523 --> 51:01.156
- I'm just trying
to look out for you.

51:01.158 --> 51:04.560
- I don't need looking
out for, never have.

51:46.903 --> 51:50.973
- All things truly wicked
start from innocence.

52:40.124 --> 52:41.357
- You get it.

52:53.770 --> 52:56.071
No, I wanna sleep forever.

53:13.590 --> 53:14.823
Okay, I'm up.

53:20.597 --> 53:21.897
What the hell?

53:24.768 --> 53:25.901
I can't see.

53:26.803 --> 53:27.770
I can't see

53:27.772 --> 53:29.438
I can't see.

53:29.440 --> 53:30.572
I can't see.

53:36.613 --> 53:38.480
What are you doing?

53:38.482 --> 53:39.515
Stop, stop.

54:00.403 --> 54:01.336
- Hello?

54:02.105 --> 54:03.472
Hello?

54:03.474 --> 54:04.940
- Go away.

54:07.010 --> 54:08.143
- Come on, let me in.

54:08.145 --> 54:09.578
- I said go!

54:09.580 --> 54:12.881
- I'm not leaving
until you let me in.

54:13.683 --> 54:16.518
- Oh my gosh.

54:16.520 --> 54:17.653
- Satisfied?

54:29.098 --> 54:31.033
- I can't believe she'd
leave you at home like this.

54:31.035 --> 54:32.334
- I told her to.

54:32.336 --> 54:33.869
- Yeah, but still.

54:33.871 --> 54:35.871
- Amanda, leave
it alone, please.

54:35.873 --> 54:37.105
- I just wanna make
sure you're being taken

54:37.107 --> 54:38.340
care of, that's all.

54:38.342 --> 54:42.010
- I appreciate that, she
is taking care of me.

54:42.012 --> 54:45.080
I just, I don't
wanna mess this up.

54:47.217 --> 54:48.917
- Can I get you anything?

54:48.919 --> 54:51.453
- Yeah, actually there's a
photo book in my dark room,

54:51.455 --> 54:52.754
could you get that for me?

54:52.756 --> 54:53.956
- Yeah, sure.

55:33.897 --> 55:35.430
So what'd the doctor say?

55:35.432 --> 55:37.833
- They said they'd
call with the results.

55:37.835 --> 55:39.401
- People don't just go
blind for no reason.

55:39.403 --> 55:41.203
- I'm aware of that, thank you.

55:41.205 --> 55:43.305
- Well I'm just saying, maybe
there has to be some type

55:43.307 --> 55:45.841
of explanation or fix for it.

55:59.622 --> 56:01.690
- These are really good.

56:02.592 --> 56:03.559
- Thanks.

56:10.800 --> 56:13.235
- She really is beautiful.

56:13.237 --> 56:14.603
- Yeah, she is.

56:18.575 --> 56:22.878
- What I wanted you to see
was on page six, I think.

56:25.915 --> 56:27.849
- Did you find it?

56:27.851 --> 56:28.817
- Yeah.

56:31.421 --> 56:34.623
- I think I'm gonna
head back to the diner.

56:34.625 --> 56:35.591
- Okay.

56:36.693 --> 56:37.960
- Can I keep this?

56:37.962 --> 56:42.030
- Yeah, of course, it's
yours, I've got others.

56:42.032 --> 56:46.335
- Call me if you need anything,
I'm just a phone call away.

56:46.337 --> 56:47.302
- Thanks.

57:15.465 --> 57:18.233
- Look at you, you are glowing.

57:18.235 --> 57:19.534
Did you give him a little?

57:21.038 --> 57:23.071
- Oh wow, frisky.

57:23.073 --> 57:24.439
- What do you want, Pedro?

57:24.441 --> 57:26.908
- It's peh-dro, not pee-dro.

57:28.144 --> 57:29.845
- Pedro, out.

57:29.847 --> 57:33.081
- Oh man, it's peh-dro, peh-dro.

57:33.083 --> 57:33.915
- Out.

57:33.917 --> 57:35.183
Andale!

57:35.185 --> 57:37.853
I got a guy in the
red room for you.

57:37.855 --> 57:40.422
You wanna dance, don't you?

57:40.424 --> 57:41.657
- What's going on?

57:41.659 --> 57:43.358
- I'm giving her a
run in the red room.

57:43.360 --> 57:46.228
- No, I have the red
customers for the next hour.

57:46.230 --> 57:47.663
- Your hour's up early.

57:47.665 --> 57:49.197
Come on, let's go.

57:49.199 --> 57:51.333
Can't keep them waiting.

59:04.107 --> 59:07.509
- Please see, please see,
please see, please see,

59:07.511 --> 59:11.813
please see, please see, please
see, please see, please see.

01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:19.014
- So sorry to keep
you waiting, she's definitely

01:00:19.016 --> 01:00:20.382
worth the wait.

01:00:27.723 --> 01:00:30.025
- What, you work here now?

01:00:30.726 --> 01:00:32.861
- Why are you so scared?

01:00:34.864 --> 01:00:36.731
I thought we had fun.

01:00:38.768 --> 01:00:41.403
Look baby, I paid for a dance.

01:00:42.572 --> 01:00:43.538
Stop.

01:00:46.943 --> 01:00:48.743
I know you liked it.

01:00:52.783 --> 01:00:53.849
Ah, dammit!

01:00:55.852 --> 01:00:57.986
- What is going on here?

01:00:59.188 --> 01:01:01.756
Go to the dressing room, now.

01:01:01.758 --> 01:01:03.725
You don't get to touch
girls in my club.

01:01:03.727 --> 01:01:05.694
You do, you're out.

01:01:05.696 --> 01:01:08.496
- Look lady, I paid for
a dance, and I'm gonna

01:01:08.498 --> 01:01:09.798
get my money's worth.

01:01:10.767 --> 01:01:12.400
And you don't get to touch me!

01:01:12.402 --> 01:01:13.235
- Ah, shit!

01:01:13.237 --> 01:01:14.436
- Johnny!

01:01:14.438 --> 01:01:15.904
Get him out of here!

01:01:15.906 --> 01:01:18.273
- This is some bullshit.

01:01:18.275 --> 01:01:20.008
- Move it.

01:01:34.924 --> 01:01:38.093
- Wipe those tears,
you're on in five.

01:01:38.095 --> 01:01:40.262
Look, what happened was
unfortunate, but it's part

01:01:40.264 --> 01:01:44.866
of the job, and you need
to make me some money.

01:01:44.868 --> 01:01:49.337
That was a loyal client,
and he's not coming back.

01:01:49.339 --> 01:01:51.306
Suck it up and leave
your emotions in here.

01:01:51.308 --> 01:01:54.743
They don't pay to
see your heart, they
pay to see your tits,

01:01:54.745 --> 01:01:56.044
now get ready.

01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:20.622
- I've never seen
anyone dance like her,

01:04:20.624 --> 01:04:23.091
look at these poor bastards.

01:04:24.093 --> 01:04:25.160
She's good.

01:05:18.547 --> 01:05:20.915
- you wanna get some pizza?

01:05:25.020 --> 01:05:27.055
Is there no more pizza left?

01:05:27.057 --> 01:05:28.857
Geez, you eat a lot.

01:05:40.569 --> 01:05:42.537
There's still nothing.

01:05:54.350 --> 01:05:55.483
- Oh, hey.

01:05:55.485 --> 01:05:56.918
- Hey.

01:05:56.920 --> 01:05:58.019
- I brought some groceries,
I'm just gonna put 'em

01:05:58.021 --> 01:05:59.320
in the fridge.

01:06:03.859 --> 01:06:06.461
- So have you found
your own place yet?

01:06:06.463 --> 01:06:10.098
Don't you think it's
about time you start?

01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:14.903
Look, he's a nice guy,
and I just don't want

01:06:14.905 --> 01:06:16.037
him to get hurt.

01:06:16.039 --> 01:06:17.572
- I can hear you.

01:06:20.442 --> 01:06:22.410
I want her here.

01:06:22.412 --> 01:06:24.445
I appreciate your help,
especially right now,

01:06:24.447 --> 01:06:28.750
I just, it's not your
place to ask her to leave.

01:06:28.752 --> 01:06:29.918
- But I'm just--

01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:31.719
- I know what
you're trying to do.

01:06:31.721 --> 01:06:34.556
- I think I'm
gonna, I'm gonna go.

01:06:34.558 --> 01:06:38.426
- Yeah, I think that's
probably for the best.

01:06:44.099 --> 01:06:47.135
- Let me know if
he needs anything.

01:07:15.264 --> 01:07:17.232
- Feels light.

01:07:17.234 --> 01:07:20.435
You better bring
it tomorrow night.

01:07:20.437 --> 01:07:23.004
- Are you saying i
didn't bring it tonight?

01:07:23.006 --> 01:07:25.974
- Oh, you brought it just
as much as you normally do.

01:07:25.976 --> 01:07:28.209
But it's not gonna
cut it anymore.

01:07:28.211 --> 01:07:30.044
- Oh yeah, why is
that, new standards?

01:07:30.046 --> 01:07:32.680
- New girls, new better girls.

01:07:33.916 --> 01:07:36.551
- Yeah, I think you mean girl.

01:08:23.631 --> 01:08:27.068
I wonder if I can fly.

01:08:27.069 --> 01:08:29.170
Would the wind swoop
under my arms like it does

01:08:29.171 --> 01:08:33.207
with the birds' wings and
carry me up to the stars?

01:08:33.209 --> 01:08:35.710
But what a terrible
death if I couldn't.

01:08:35.712 --> 01:08:39.413
And what a silly girl
for thinking I could.

01:08:40.948 --> 01:08:43.651
For the first time since
I've been here, I feel like

01:08:43.653 --> 01:08:47.220
I might actually get
what I've always wanted.

01:08:47.223 --> 01:08:49.290
But now that it's within my
grasp, I wonder if that's

01:08:49.292 --> 01:08:50.992
what I really want.

01:08:52.361 --> 01:08:54.362
I miss my sisters.

01:08:54.363 --> 01:08:56.497
I miss the sea, my home.

01:08:57.765 --> 01:09:00.068
Would she even let me go back?

01:09:00.069 --> 01:09:02.370
Would I go back if I could?

01:09:13.816 --> 01:09:15.515
- Are you out here?

01:09:17.953 --> 01:09:20.154
For a moment I think about just

01:09:20.156 --> 01:09:23.124
sitting here silently
until he leaves.

01:09:23.126 --> 01:09:25.693
Maybe he'll go back to sleep.

01:09:42.578 --> 01:09:43.544
- Hello?

01:09:47.416 --> 01:09:49.450
If I hold him one more time,

01:09:49.452 --> 01:09:51.819
there's no way I could go.

01:10:10.005 --> 01:10:11.639
- You're freezing.

01:10:13.675 --> 01:10:16.310
Come on, let's go back to bed.

01:10:57.519 --> 01:10:58.719
Good morning.

01:11:05.394 --> 01:11:08.796
Smells good, did you
make me breakfast?

01:11:18.607 --> 01:11:21.409
Thank you, for being so patient.

01:11:28.650 --> 01:11:32.019
No, I need to learn
to do it on my own.

01:11:35.691 --> 01:11:38.092
Okay, but just this one time,
and then I need to learn

01:11:38.094 --> 01:11:40.294
to do it on my own, okay?

01:12:26.575 --> 01:12:27.542
Hello?

01:12:30.647 --> 01:12:32.113
Yeah, that's me.

01:12:34.182 --> 01:12:35.716
What do you mean?

01:12:37.085 --> 01:12:41.889
I told you that I was like
this when I woke up, I...

01:12:41.891 --> 01:12:45.626
No, I haven't been like
this my whole life.

01:12:46.895 --> 01:12:50.698
No, I understand, I don't think
you understand what I'm te.

01:12:52.834 --> 01:12:53.868
Okay, okay.

01:13:07.749 --> 01:13:08.716
Don't.

01:13:16.191 --> 01:13:17.625
Please, don't.

01:13:17.627 --> 01:13:19.427
Just leave me alone.

01:13:22.164 --> 01:13:23.564
Leave me alone!

01:13:59.234 --> 01:14:00.368
- You're on.

01:14:08.143 --> 01:14:09.610
I need to talk to you.

01:14:09.612 --> 01:14:11.812
- That doesn't sound good.

01:14:11.814 --> 01:14:15.683
- I'm going to put her in the
ten o'clock spot on Saturday.

01:14:15.685 --> 01:14:17.051
- No.

01:14:17.053 --> 01:14:18.252
- She's bringing in more money.

01:14:18.254 --> 01:14:19.453
- That's my spot!

01:14:19.455 --> 01:14:22.857
- It's nothing personal,
it's just business.

01:14:22.859 --> 01:14:24.091
- She's been here for two weeks.

01:14:24.093 --> 01:14:25.226
I've been here for
over two years.

01:14:25.228 --> 01:14:26.260
I've earned it.

01:14:26.262 --> 01:14:27.728
- You haven't earned anything.

01:14:29.132 --> 01:14:30.531
- Bullshit!

01:14:30.533 --> 01:14:31.732
I have earned it.

01:14:31.734 --> 01:14:33.267
I have always been
your number one girl.

01:14:33.269 --> 01:14:34.869
Remember when mack was gonna
fire you and I got all those

01:14:34.871 --> 01:14:38.105
guys to come in and we made
that night than we ever have?

01:14:38.107 --> 01:14:40.841
And now you do this to me?

01:14:40.843 --> 01:14:41.876
- Sit down.

01:14:43.879 --> 01:14:45.813
Let me give you a little
life lesson, okay?

01:14:45.815 --> 01:14:47.782
- Oh yeah, that's
rich, coming from you.

01:14:47.784 --> 01:14:51.585
- Sky, I'm not
firing you, I'm just.

01:14:51.587 --> 01:14:52.820
What are you doing?

01:14:52.822 --> 01:14:54.288
- What does it look
like I'm doing?

01:14:54.290 --> 01:14:57.191
- I just said I'm
not firing you.

01:15:00.395 --> 01:15:01.662
- I'm quitting.

01:15:01.664 --> 01:15:02.630
- What are you gonna do?

01:15:02.632 --> 01:15:03.564
- Don't know.

01:15:03.566 --> 01:15:04.799
- Why don't you just stay here?

01:15:04.801 --> 01:15:06.767
Make some money while
you're figuring it out?

01:15:06.769 --> 01:15:10.237
- I don't play second
fiddle to anybody.

01:15:12.374 --> 01:15:13.340
- Shit.

01:15:19.681 --> 01:15:21.549
- Hey, what up, mamí?

01:15:27.556 --> 01:15:29.690
- Can I get an eight ball?

01:15:29.692 --> 01:15:31.058
- Huh?

01:15:31.060 --> 01:15:32.993
I thought you..

01:15:33.996 --> 01:15:35.196
Are you sure?

01:15:38.667 --> 01:15:41.068
Alright, whatever you want.

01:16:58.079 --> 01:16:59.213
- Good girl.

01:18:37.746 --> 01:18:40.314
- Hello, darling.

01:18:42.884 --> 01:18:45.519
- Ma'am, you can't smoke here.

01:18:53.663 --> 01:18:56.463
- Don't be so rude, say "hello".

01:18:58.500 --> 01:18:59.466
- Hello?

01:19:00.802 --> 01:19:01.902
I can speak?

01:19:03.004 --> 01:19:05.539
- Don't get so excited.

01:19:05.541 --> 01:19:08.776
I just came her to have
a conversation with you.

01:19:08.778 --> 01:19:10.210
- Okay.

01:19:10.212 --> 01:19:12.680
- So, tell me what happened.

01:19:13.982 --> 01:19:15.616
Hold that thought.

01:19:19.955 --> 01:19:20.921
Carry on.

01:19:21.957 --> 01:19:25.592
- I came home and she
was there with him.

01:19:28.030 --> 01:19:29.563
- And what were they doing?

01:19:29.565 --> 01:19:30.597
- They were uh--

01:19:30.599 --> 01:19:32.232
- screwing?

01:19:32.234 --> 01:19:34.101
I take that as a "yes".

01:19:34.103 --> 01:19:35.069
Honey.

01:19:38.106 --> 01:19:40.641
You should really, really
use your voice while you

01:19:40.643 --> 01:19:41.942
have a moment.

01:19:43.378 --> 01:19:45.212
What do you want?

01:19:45.214 --> 01:19:47.681
- I want him, and I want us.

01:19:48.683 --> 01:19:52.052
- Well, obviously
that's not an option.

01:19:52.054 --> 01:19:54.521
- What are my options, then?

01:19:56.691 --> 01:20:00.995
- Well, your sisters gave
up all their hair for this.

01:20:07.569 --> 01:20:09.069
- What do I have to do?

01:20:09.071 --> 01:20:10.637
- Easy, kill him.

01:20:13.875 --> 01:20:16.677
Plunge it straight
through his heart.

01:20:16.679 --> 01:20:17.711
- Kill him?

01:20:18.780 --> 01:20:20.447
- I don't know
what the issue is.

01:20:20.449 --> 01:20:24.852
I mean, did you clearly
not see what was going on?

01:20:24.854 --> 01:20:26.920
- I saw.

01:20:26.922 --> 01:20:29.723
- Well, that's your only option.

01:20:30.625 --> 01:20:33.594
Do you really want to stay here?

01:20:35.731 --> 01:20:38.265
I mean, every time you
see a happy couple walking

01:20:38.267 --> 01:20:42.469
down the street, your
little heart's gonna break.

01:20:44.205 --> 01:20:46.940
Every time you smell something,

01:20:50.011 --> 01:20:52.279
every time you hear
something that reminds

01:20:52.281 --> 01:20:56.517
you of him, it's gonna
break over and over again.

01:20:59.421 --> 01:21:03.424
It'll go by fast, then
you can go back to doing

01:21:05.193 --> 01:21:07.094
whatever it is that you do.

01:21:10.565 --> 01:21:12.366
Well, I've gotta go.

01:21:16.538 --> 01:21:19.173
Much bigger things to be done.

01:21:20.008 --> 01:21:21.375
Any last words?

01:21:22.277 --> 01:21:23.877
Too late.

01:24:49.784 --> 01:24:51.852
I did not become foam on the

01:24:51.854 --> 01:24:53.820
ocean as the sea witch had said.

01:24:53.822 --> 01:24:58.525
Instead, I lifted up to
the sky, towards the stars.

01:24:58.527 --> 01:25:00.994
I became one of the daughters
of the air, doing good

01:25:00.996 --> 01:25:03.563
deeds and earning a soul.

01:25:03.565 --> 01:25:07.734
In 300 years I shall rise
like this into heaven.

01:25:07.736 --> 01:25:11.204
Not because of a man,
but because of me.
