WEBVTT

00:11.590 --> 00:13.493
This is it.

00:13.528 --> 00:16.299
The slightest misstep
means disaster.

00:19.506 --> 00:21.744
Ah, my best work yet.

00:21.777 --> 00:24.248
Sadly, I think you're right.

00:24.282 --> 00:25.752
Another one
for the maybe pile.

00:25.785 --> 00:29.258
Mmm.

00:29.292 --> 00:31.329
Cheryl, you know I love you,
but if you don't start helping,

00:31.362 --> 00:33.300
I'm gonna snap your vertebrae
like pistachios.

00:33.333 --> 00:35.738
Aw,
that does sound like love!

00:35.772 --> 00:38.678
Come on! We need 100 of those
by the end of the day.

00:38.711 --> 00:40.447
Well, since we're not
gonna make it anyway,

00:40.480 --> 00:43.621
it won't matter if you eat one.

00:43.654 --> 00:45.725
You know I'm trying
to keep that under control!

00:47.127 --> 00:48.063
Why do you think
I'm doing it?

00:50.535 --> 00:52.371
- Yaa-- ah-ha-ow...

00:52.404 --> 00:54.342
I saw you lick crumbs
off your face--I win.

00:54.375 --> 00:56.680
- You okay?
- Why was it so hot?

00:56.714 --> 00:58.450
Were you...
wearing oven mitts?

00:58.483 --> 01:00.287
What are those?

01:00.320 --> 01:01.824
Damn it!
What are you idiots doing?

01:01.857 --> 01:03.594
You tell us, ass-face.

01:03.628 --> 01:05.798
You say we're on a secret
mission to destroy Fabian,

01:05.832 --> 01:08.470
and we've been undercover
for three weeks in this bakery.

01:08.504 --> 01:10.173
It's a patisserie,

01:10.207 --> 01:11.810
and it's not like I love
having you

01:11.844 --> 01:13.581
mess up my profitable
side business.

01:13.614 --> 01:15.785
That you use
as a personal slush fund.

01:15.818 --> 01:17.154
Obviously, that.

01:17.187 --> 01:18.524
Wait, where's the other guy?

01:18.557 --> 01:20.460
Weird beard science dick?

01:20.494 --> 01:22.866
Everyone knows that
sourdough starter is alive,

01:22.899 --> 01:25.470
but the question remains,
is it horny?

01:25.505 --> 01:26.807
Listen up.

01:26.840 --> 01:29.312
Our intelligence says
that Fabian will venture out

01:29.345 --> 01:31.449
into the open soon,
then you'll kill him.

01:31.482 --> 01:33.486
Wait, this is
a straight-up assassination?

01:33.521 --> 01:35.457
What are you, children?
Yes!

01:35.490 --> 01:37.729
He's blackmailed
the president of Manatina

01:37.762 --> 01:39.398
into declaring martial law,

01:39.432 --> 01:42.304
and is turning the whole country
into his personal fiefdom.

01:42.338 --> 01:44.475
Why not just
have CIA hitmen do it?

01:44.509 --> 01:47.147
First off,
the CIA doesn't have hitmen.

01:47.181 --> 01:48.651
Second, they're busy.

01:48.684 --> 01:51.122
Third, we can't have
our fingerprints on this.

01:51.155 --> 01:53.393
Unlike every pastry
you dingdongs make.

01:53.426 --> 01:56.667
Yeah, it'd be a real shame
if the CIA got a bad name.

01:56.700 --> 01:58.738
All I'm saying is
that we can't have blowback.

01:58.771 --> 02:00.273
So if I get captured--

02:00.307 --> 02:01.309
Put a bullet in your head?

02:01.342 --> 02:03.380
No! Jesus.
Just rescue me.

02:03.413 --> 02:04.516
You were way too quick
with that.

02:04.549 --> 02:07.321
And the fewer CIA people
we have involved, the better.

02:07.354 --> 02:08.323
We might have a mole.

02:08.356 --> 02:09.793
Oh, you don't say.

02:09.826 --> 02:11.797
I mean, at this point
isn't Langley

02:11.830 --> 02:13.901
considered
a national wildlife refuge?

02:13.934 --> 02:15.772
You've got so many rodents
in the CIA

02:15.805 --> 02:19.312
that the "C" probably stands
for Chuck E Cheese.

02:19.345 --> 02:20.815
Why are you thinking
about Chuck E Cheese?

02:20.848 --> 02:22.852
Because you want to go there
with a kid that you got tricked

02:22.886 --> 02:25.223
into having, who no longer
sees you as her father?

02:25.257 --> 02:27.294
Or maybe the other kid you had
with a hooker?

02:27.328 --> 02:28.931
Whoa.
Jesus, Slater.

02:28.964 --> 02:30.902
The "C" stands for Central.

02:30.935 --> 02:32.939
It's a soft "C".

02:32.972 --> 02:35.444
All right,
let's go kill the guy.

03:14.656 --> 03:16.225
So we've got a man
on the inside.

03:16.259 --> 03:18.864
He says Fabian is leaving
the presidential residence soon,

03:18.898 --> 03:21.235
and the only route takes him
through the central square

03:21.269 --> 03:22.539
and right by us here

03:22.572 --> 03:24.676
at the Confectionery Institute
of the Americas.

03:24.710 --> 03:26.547
- Subtle.
- I don't do subtle.

03:26.580 --> 03:28.851
Has anyone ever explained
to you what a spy is?

03:28.884 --> 03:31.355
Has anyone ever explained
to you what alcoholism is?

03:31.389 --> 03:32.992
Yeah, like dozens of times.

03:33.026 --> 03:35.464
Okay, this is our killbox.

03:35.497 --> 03:36.834
Oh, great.
The only problem I have

03:36.867 --> 03:38.704
with this is that it is insane.

03:38.738 --> 03:40.742
You can't put a killbox
in a public square.

03:40.775 --> 03:43.012
Hmm, let me look.
Yeah, I can,

03:43.046 --> 03:44.583
and if you don't want
to do this mission,

03:44.616 --> 03:47.354
it is your God given right
as an American to go home

03:47.387 --> 03:49.391
and face the crimes
you've all been framed for.

03:49.425 --> 03:51.730
Honestly,
not one of my favorite rights.

03:51.764 --> 03:53.801
Move over,
quartering of soldiers.

03:53.834 --> 03:55.505
This is President Lucero,

03:55.538 --> 03:57.441
until now,
a progressive reformer.

03:57.474 --> 03:59.613
But she's been blackmailed
and possibly taken hostage

03:59.646 --> 04:02.484
by Fabian and a security team
led by

04:02.519 --> 04:04.523
our friend Ray Gillette.

04:04.556 --> 04:06.593
Hey, I know that guy!

04:06.627 --> 04:09.465
- Look, Cheryl, fairy stix!

04:09.498 --> 04:11.603
I always carry some. Continue.

04:11.637 --> 04:14.408
Wait, how are we gonna take
out Fabian without hitting Ray?

04:14.442 --> 04:15.878
I mean, he's being a douche,

04:15.912 --> 04:17.582
but if being a douche
were a capital offense,

04:17.615 --> 04:19.285
we'd have to carpet bomb
Wall Street.

04:19.318 --> 04:20.822
And frankly,
seems expensive.

04:20.855 --> 04:22.625
Look, Ray made his choice.

04:22.659 --> 04:23.928
And this might be
our only chance

04:23.961 --> 04:25.898
before Fabian
solidifies control.

04:25.932 --> 04:28.303
Aw, but it's Ray.

04:28.336 --> 04:29.606
I just--

04:29.639 --> 04:31.944
I just put
so much awesome tech in him.

04:31.977 --> 04:33.948
He's more machine now than man.

04:33.981 --> 04:36.319
Look, I get it.
I'm human.

04:36.352 --> 04:37.856
And I'm sensitive
to your feelings here,

04:37.889 --> 04:39.492
but if it comes down to it,

04:39.526 --> 04:41.697
shoot Fabian
through Ray's goddamn head.

04:41.730 --> 04:43.701
- What about her?
- She's not our concern.

04:43.734 --> 04:45.905
It's the CIA's policy
not to intervene

04:45.938 --> 04:47.909
in other countries'
internal politics.

04:47.942 --> 04:50.681
Or you're hoping
this mess will get her deposed

04:50.715 --> 04:52.050
and you can replace her
with a right-wing dictator.

04:52.084 --> 04:53.453
TouchÃ©.

04:53.486 --> 04:55.023
I think it's pronounced Pinochet.

04:55.056 --> 04:57.562
Whatever.
Be ready in half an hour.

04:57.595 --> 05:00.601
Not to be sentimental,
but if Ray does die,

05:00.635 --> 05:03.808
I'd like my stuff back
from his corpse.

05:03.841 --> 05:06.312
Did anybody bring a chainsaw?

05:06.345 --> 05:07.682
Everybody ready?

05:07.715 --> 05:09.886
Yeah, but it's weird
not having Ray here.

05:09.920 --> 05:11.657
Come on, he'd probably
just make some crack

05:11.690 --> 05:14.863
about how I'm unreliable
and drunk.

05:14.896 --> 05:16.365
It's just so unfair.

05:16.399 --> 05:18.604
Yeah, he'd say something like,
"If only we had

05:18.637 --> 05:20.842
to kill your liver,
we could just wait 10 minutes."

05:20.875 --> 05:22.010
Aha, okay.

05:22.044 --> 05:24.816
- Easy, 007 and seven.
- Okay.

05:24.850 --> 05:26.553
If I wanted a partner
that pissed,

05:26.587 --> 05:28.122
I'd team up with your underwear
tomorrow morning.

05:28.156 --> 05:29.693
Okay, Jesus.

05:29.726 --> 05:31.062
Now I really do
want to kill him.

05:31.095 --> 05:32.765
Do you really think
he's gone bad?

05:32.799 --> 05:36.339
I mean, he did give
all our secrets to Fabian,

05:36.372 --> 05:39.044
and before that, he was working
at IIA without telling us.

05:39.078 --> 05:41.517
And he was really touchy
about the snake bite thing,

05:41.550 --> 05:42.986
and the spider bite thing.

05:43.019 --> 05:44.656
I mean, come on, get over it.

05:44.689 --> 05:46.459
I did, like, immediately.

05:46.492 --> 05:48.531
Okay, we'll have a better shot
at not killing Ray

05:48.564 --> 05:50.066
if we adjust these positions slightly.

05:50.100 --> 05:51.637
I've got it, Lana.

05:51.670 --> 05:53.707
Here's what we do.

05:53.741 --> 05:55.811
Okay, so the first task
is blocking the exit.

05:55.845 --> 05:57.481
Cheryl, that's on you.

05:57.515 --> 05:59.485
"Father of Freedom,
may you stand and watch over us

05:59.519 --> 06:01.723
until the last trumpet plays."

06:01.757 --> 06:03.126
Yikes.

06:03.159 --> 06:04.729
We're gonna need a trumpet.

06:04.763 --> 06:06.499
Pam, after that,
you'll join Cyril

06:06.533 --> 06:08.136
at the entrance,
so they can't retreat.

06:08.169 --> 06:10.675
So we're, uh,
really doing this.

06:10.708 --> 06:12.612
No, you're dreaming.
That's why this doesn't hurt.

06:12.645 --> 06:13.981
Ah!

06:14.014 --> 06:14.916
Lana, you're eagle eye.

06:14.950 --> 06:16.620
Call out threats.

06:16.653 --> 06:17.855
If you've got
a clear shot, take it.

06:17.889 --> 06:19.859
Meanwhile,
I will ready myself

06:19.893 --> 06:21.997
for combat using
spiritual techniques

06:22.030 --> 06:24.368
that owe much too
Spartan and Maori ritual.

06:26.138 --> 06:28.476
Excuse me,
I asked for a martini,

06:28.510 --> 06:30.548
not a liquid analog
of your character;

06:30.581 --> 06:32.719
weak and disappointing.

06:32.752 --> 06:33.687
Archer, I'm seeing an alleyway

06:33.721 --> 06:34.923
that's not on the map.

06:34.956 --> 06:36.158
Could be
a possible escape route.

06:36.192 --> 06:37.494
We should shift--
- Lana, quick question.

06:37.528 --> 06:38.496
Are you Laszlo Toth?

06:38.530 --> 06:40.501
I am not.

06:40.534 --> 06:42.772
Then why are you despoiling
my perfect work of art?

06:42.805 --> 06:44.041
Fabian will be
in the middle of the motorcade

06:44.074 --> 06:45.611
well past the alley.

06:45.645 --> 06:47.782
It'll be fine.

06:47.815 --> 06:49.552
Motorcade approaching.

06:49.586 --> 06:51.723
Three cars.
30 seconds to contact.

06:51.757 --> 06:53.092
Let's pucker and poke her, boys.

06:53.126 --> 06:54.061
Come on.
- Really?

06:54.094 --> 06:55.196
No!

06:55.230 --> 06:56.232
Look, as leader,
you need to clear

06:56.265 --> 06:58.837
a new catchphrase with me
before you trot it out

06:58.871 --> 07:00.775
in front of everybody
like a brain damaged

07:00.808 --> 07:02.512
suicidal circus horse.

07:02.545 --> 07:04.549
Wink your stinks,
no time to think.

07:04.582 --> 07:06.018
What did I just say?

07:06.052 --> 07:07.154
Everyone shut up.

07:07.187 --> 07:08.624
Cheryl,
are you ready to detonate?

07:08.657 --> 07:09.993
Ready!
man: Miss?

07:10.026 --> 07:11.162
Less ready.

07:11.195 --> 07:12.699
Not ready!

07:14.736 --> 07:16.038
Abort! Abort!

07:16.072 --> 07:17.775
Just throw it!

07:23.654 --> 07:25.691
Ha ha!
It was the last trump--

07:25.725 --> 07:28.530
oh, it hit the woodwinds.

07:34.141 --> 07:35.878
Converge on car two!

07:35.911 --> 07:37.114
No, do not converge.
He might not be--

07:37.147 --> 07:38.751
Ignore! Converge!

07:38.784 --> 07:41.790
Also, abort that last order.
Just for spite.

07:41.823 --> 07:43.827
Nobody's here.

07:43.861 --> 07:45.063
Come on, Ray.

07:45.096 --> 07:47.802
Bend down and tie
your shoe or something.

07:47.835 --> 07:49.138
I don't have the shot!

07:49.171 --> 07:52.612
I repeat, no shot.
Archer, the cafe!

07:55.250 --> 07:56.687
Oh, you little--

08:01.062 --> 08:03.734
Can't say I'm sorry, Fabian.

08:03.767 --> 08:05.103
What the shit, Ray?

08:05.136 --> 08:06.940
You're gonna take a bullet
for this douchehole?

08:06.973 --> 08:08.677
Kinda hoping not to,
but I'm not the one

08:08.711 --> 08:10.080
pointing a gun at me!

08:10.113 --> 08:12.685
He made the only
rational choice, Archer.

08:12.719 --> 08:13.921
You should do the same.

08:13.954 --> 08:16.192
An entire country
at your disposal.

08:16.225 --> 08:18.162
Every appetite fulfilled.

08:18.196 --> 08:20.935
Hah! My appetites will
never be fulfilled, Fabian,

08:20.968 --> 08:23.206
because I am ultimately empty,

08:23.239 --> 08:25.778
is, I guess, what I'm arguing.

08:25.811 --> 08:27.247
But it doesn't matter.

08:27.280 --> 08:29.051
You can't do a hostile takeover
of a whole country.

08:29.084 --> 08:30.588
You'll get thrown out eventually.

08:30.621 --> 08:32.792
True,
if I didn't have leverage.

08:32.825 --> 08:35.030
We discovered
the world's biggest deposit

08:35.063 --> 08:38.069
of the rare earth metal
Hexon downriver.

08:38.102 --> 08:40.006
Thanks for getting me a sample
last time you were here.

08:40.040 --> 08:42.310
Come on, Ray.
We have to save the agency.

08:42.344 --> 08:43.881
It's Mother's legacy.

08:43.914 --> 08:45.584
That has to mean something
to you.

08:45.618 --> 08:47.154
Don't guilt trip me!

08:47.187 --> 08:49.024
You didn't even come see me
in the hospital

08:49.058 --> 08:51.062
when you got me bitten
by that snake!

08:51.095 --> 08:51.997
- And now you're giggling

08:52.030 --> 08:54.034
about it!
- I am not.

08:54.068 --> 08:57.107
Ray, I swear, I was thinking
of something else.

09:00.080 --> 09:01.817
It was the spider.

09:01.850 --> 09:04.188
Well, now I found someone
who knows what loyalty means.

09:04.221 --> 09:05.725
- Sorry!

09:05.758 --> 09:08.797
It was just the perfect moment
for that!

09:08.831 --> 09:09.933
You idiot!

09:09.966 --> 09:11.135
Oh, I'm the idiot?

09:11.168 --> 09:12.638
You just got double-crossed!

09:12.672 --> 09:14.007
I was playing him!

09:14.041 --> 09:15.978
But that doesn't make any--
okay.

09:16.011 --> 09:17.882
That might make a little sense,

09:17.915 --> 09:19.151
but why didn't you kill him?

09:19.184 --> 09:21.088
Because I'm not gonna kill
the one person

09:21.122 --> 09:22.892
who can actually
clear our names!

09:22.925 --> 09:24.829
You think Slater cares enough
to do it?

09:24.863 --> 09:27.067
And now we don't even
have anybody on the inside!

09:27.100 --> 09:28.837
That's where you're wrong, Ray.

09:28.871 --> 09:30.574
Slater has a mole!

09:30.608 --> 09:32.344
- I'm the mole!
- Wow.

09:32.377 --> 09:34.783
He was totally willing
to kill you to get to Fabian.

09:34.816 --> 09:36.285
What a freaking shock.

09:36.318 --> 09:38.824
I was trying to set this up
so we could capture Fabian

09:38.857 --> 09:40.628
and have him clear our names.

09:40.661 --> 09:43.299
So you just made this
whole thing infinitely harder.

09:43.332 --> 09:45.638
Ass.
- Well, obviously,

09:45.671 --> 09:48.276
but what about--huh.

09:48.309 --> 09:49.344
But wait, then...

09:49.378 --> 09:51.917
ah, shit.

09:56.091 --> 09:58.062
Well, yet another
successful mission

09:58.095 --> 09:59.699
for the ass-for-head gang.

09:59.732 --> 10:01.135
Yeah, well,
maybe you could have told us

10:01.168 --> 10:02.905
Ray was your man
on the inside.

10:02.939 --> 10:04.174
How would that have helped?

10:04.208 --> 10:06.045
Maybe they wouldn't
have almost killed me?

10:06.078 --> 10:08.049
No, I mean
how would that help me?

10:08.082 --> 10:10.120
And how do we even know
you're not playing both sides

10:10.153 --> 10:12.324
right now?

10:12.357 --> 10:13.794
Oh, don't answer
all at once, y'all.

10:13.827 --> 10:15.196
Ugh!

10:15.230 --> 10:17.234
Now I have to bring in
an independent kill team.

10:17.267 --> 10:19.806
Where are you gonna find
an independent kill team?

10:19.839 --> 10:21.075
The CIA!

10:21.108 --> 10:22.812
We'll just make them all
change their shirts.

10:22.845 --> 10:24.949
The point is,
you're all demoted to support.

10:24.983 --> 10:26.953
And if we don't agree?

10:26.987 --> 10:28.690
Good luck getting through
the airport metal detector

10:28.724 --> 10:30.828
with my steel-toed boot
up your ass.

10:30.861 --> 10:32.297
And even if you made it
back to America,

10:32.330 --> 10:33.834
you'd still all be felons.

10:33.867 --> 10:35.103
- Seriously?
- Oh, come on.

10:35.136 --> 10:36.873
Yeah, that's right.
Now I have to go talk

10:36.907 --> 10:39.077
to the real professionals.

10:39.111 --> 10:41.683
And get those
fucking muffins done.

10:41.716 --> 10:43.252
So y'all baking now?

10:43.286 --> 10:45.958
- Shut up, Ray.
- No, I won't shut up.

10:45.991 --> 10:48.129
Can we at least acknowledge
y'all were wrong about me?

10:48.162 --> 10:50.400
Do you honestly still think
I've gone over to Fabian?

10:50.433 --> 10:52.237
And that's unlikely, why?

10:52.270 --> 10:53.707
Okay, that's fair.

10:53.740 --> 10:55.845
But I'm back now,
and I think we should call it

10:55.878 --> 10:57.180
"Raydemption."

10:57.214 --> 10:59.919
How about possibly
not a raging asshole?

10:59.953 --> 11:02.057
Emphasis on possibly.
- I like mine better.

11:02.090 --> 11:04.127
Look, it kind of seems like
we're cornered here.

11:04.161 --> 11:06.900
So maybe we just do the job
and sort it out later.

11:06.933 --> 11:08.837
No. No, that is not
what we are doing.

11:08.871 --> 11:11.108
Look, my whole with IIA
was to go with the flow,

11:11.141 --> 11:12.410
do my job, and go home.

11:12.444 --> 11:14.147
And look where that got us.

11:14.181 --> 11:15.985
There was no way we get out
of this if we just hope

11:16.018 --> 11:17.320
things turn out okay.

11:17.354 --> 11:18.891
We have to take control.

11:18.924 --> 11:20.728
Yeah, that's a fun series
of words, Lana,

11:20.761 --> 11:21.863
but so is Mad Libs.

11:21.897 --> 11:23.266
Okay, so how's this?

11:23.299 --> 11:25.871
We pretend to work support,
go rogue, grab Fabian,

11:25.905 --> 11:28.009
get him out of the country,
and use him to clear our names.

11:28.042 --> 11:29.812
Well, that I do like.
You got a plan?

11:29.846 --> 11:31.783
- Always.
- So to be clear,

11:31.816 --> 11:34.354
are we or aren't we
playing Mad Libs?

11:34.388 --> 11:36.325
Either way,
my response is boobs.

11:38.496 --> 11:40.033
Listen up failures,

11:40.066 --> 11:41.937
what I need you to do
is nothing.

11:41.970 --> 11:44.174
Sit here and smell each other's
farts until I say.

11:44.208 --> 11:45.778
We may need you
for a distraction,

11:45.811 --> 11:47.815
or something.

11:47.848 --> 11:49.084
Okay,
we don't have much time

11:49.117 --> 11:50.754
before the heavy hitters
get here.

11:50.788 --> 11:53.025
Uh, since it's my plan,
shouldn't I be the one talking?

11:53.059 --> 11:54.896
That goes against
my every instinct,

11:54.929 --> 11:56.332
but we don't have time
to argue.

11:56.365 --> 11:59.204
So I'm gonna keep talking
because it feels natural.

11:59.238 --> 12:01.342
Ray, you can't go in
because they know your face,

12:01.375 --> 12:03.312
but you know the layout
and the security holes,

12:03.346 --> 12:05.350
so you're gonna be crucial
on the radio.

12:05.383 --> 12:06.920
We're counting on you.

12:06.953 --> 12:07.922
Really?
Good Lord!

12:07.955 --> 12:08.924
I mean...
Hey!

12:08.957 --> 12:09.926
Ray risked his life for us!

12:09.959 --> 12:12.130
So shut up and get going.

12:12.163 --> 12:13.332
Hey, Ray,
I just wanna say

12:13.366 --> 12:15.370
that I appreciate
the sacrifices you made.

12:15.403 --> 12:17.107
Finally, someone!
Thank you.

12:17.140 --> 12:19.344
But if you do betray us,
I'll flay you under

12:19.378 --> 12:20.848
a lemon juice waterfall.

12:20.881 --> 12:22.317
I'll make
an Aztec blood sacrifice

12:22.350 --> 12:24.321
look like
a Girl Scout jamboree.

12:24.354 --> 12:26.860
Now gulp and then say,
"Yes, Lana."

12:26.893 --> 12:28.964
Yes, Lana.

12:28.997 --> 12:31.468
Whew!
Oh, buddy, sorry about Lana.

12:31.503 --> 12:33.507
Because I think she was
a little too lenient.

12:33.540 --> 12:35.978
And speaking of jamborees,
I will roast marshmallows

12:36.011 --> 12:39.351
over your burning,
but still barely alive body.

12:39.384 --> 12:42.390
Y'all's level of trust
is truly inspiring.

12:45.864 --> 12:46.967
Ready?

12:47.000 --> 12:48.469
Uh, not sure.

12:48.503 --> 12:51.208
You wanna give me a speech
about my plan before we go?

12:51.241 --> 12:53.379
Don't be petty, Lana.
It's unbecoming.

12:53.412 --> 12:54.949
Don't forget your bag.

12:54.983 --> 12:56.352
Ow!

12:56.385 --> 12:58.489
So petty!

12:58.523 --> 13:01.295
Oh no, wait! That was my bag.

13:04.001 --> 13:05.838
What are you doing here?

13:05.871 --> 13:08.877
We're... delivering pastries?

13:08.910 --> 13:10.981
What is this mierda?

13:11.015 --> 13:13.252
Don't be a dick.
That one's pretty good.

13:13.285 --> 13:14.321
I even put my name on it.

13:14.354 --> 13:15.991
Excuse me.

13:16.025 --> 13:18.129
Is there a problem here?

13:18.162 --> 13:19.431
Yes, Lana.

13:19.464 --> 13:21.402
I just stepped
in a puddle of raw sewage

13:21.435 --> 13:23.840
in shoes that cost more
than your car.

13:23.874 --> 13:25.376
Well, if it makes you
feel better,

13:25.410 --> 13:27.113
you could always
get me a nicer car.

13:27.147 --> 13:28.382
No, no, no.

13:28.416 --> 13:30.554
This isn't the solution, homies.

13:30.587 --> 13:33.125
Let's just chill like krill.

13:33.159 --> 13:35.029
They live in cold water.

13:38.035 --> 13:40.206
Okay, all right, everyone.

13:40.239 --> 13:42.310
I--I know when I'm...

13:42.344 --> 13:44.181
about to kick some ass!

13:55.938 --> 13:57.908
Oh, wow, that looks bad.

13:59.177 --> 14:01.415
Lana! Get out here!

14:01.448 --> 14:04.021
I hate you!

14:04.054 --> 14:05.156
Ow!

14:16.111 --> 14:18.249
Hell yeah, Cyril, get some!

14:18.282 --> 14:20.053
I just got some!

14:22.490 --> 14:24.227
Oh, hey!

14:24.261 --> 14:25.998
Lana, wow, you're here.

14:26.031 --> 14:27.902
Thank you so much
for stopping by.

14:27.935 --> 14:30.239
I should be mad at you
for not helping but...

14:30.273 --> 14:31.442
But what?

14:31.475 --> 14:32.611
But I stepped on you

14:32.645 --> 14:34.047
with the poop shoe.

14:34.081 --> 14:36.318
Oh, and one more thing.

14:36.351 --> 14:37.588
Eat me.

14:38.657 --> 14:40.226
We're ready.

14:40.259 --> 14:42.063
Okay,
two guards flanking the door,

14:42.097 --> 14:43.199
and a third near the desk.

14:43.232 --> 14:44.334
Cover on the left

14:44.367 --> 14:47.240
in three, two, one, mark.

14:53.720 --> 14:55.691
Freeze, Fabian,
or don't.

14:55.724 --> 14:57.260
I wouldn't really care
either way.

14:57.293 --> 14:59.431
Yet another misstep
on your part.

14:59.464 --> 15:01.101
I've got you
right where I want--

15:02.103 --> 15:03.072
Jesus!

15:03.105 --> 15:04.509
Yeah, sorry.

15:04.542 --> 15:06.011
I just couldn't listen
to another goddamn speech.

15:06.044 --> 15:07.147
You know what? Fair.

15:07.180 --> 15:08.282
You, come with us.

15:08.315 --> 15:09.351
It'll be safer for you.

15:09.384 --> 15:11.956
Oh, oh! Why?

15:14.127 --> 15:15.029
Because that!

15:19.137 --> 15:21.108
A-are you here
to rescue me?

15:21.141 --> 15:22.277
Uh, who are you again?

15:22.310 --> 15:23.412
This is the president!

15:23.446 --> 15:25.517
She's being held hostage
and blackmailed.

15:25.551 --> 15:27.253
This one is different
than the one

15:27.287 --> 15:29.659
we blackmailed
with the bank stuff?

15:29.692 --> 15:31.529
At this point,
I honestly do not care.

15:33.633 --> 15:34.969
Across the hall!

15:35.002 --> 15:37.240
Come on, hurry!

15:37.273 --> 15:39.010
Go, go!

15:42.350 --> 15:45.189
Fabian, I've been meaning
to tell you something.

15:45.223 --> 15:46.258
- Ow!

15:47.327 --> 15:48.462
Why are you stopping?

15:48.496 --> 15:50.601
Because... that?

15:58.717 --> 16:01.689
See, if this were my van,
it'd be so much better.

16:01.723 --> 16:03.192
What, like we'd have
knockout gas?

16:03.225 --> 16:04.562
No, but when we get
torn apart

16:04.595 --> 16:06.165
we'd have a kickass soundtrack.

16:06.198 --> 16:07.200
- Dude!

16:07.233 --> 16:08.302
You shut up! Let her talk!

16:08.335 --> 16:10.273
Shut up!
Fabian is the target.

16:10.306 --> 16:11.543
Archer and I are
getting him out of here,

16:11.576 --> 16:12.978
the rest of you scatter.

16:13.012 --> 16:14.381
Meet at the secondary
rendezvous point.

16:14.414 --> 16:16.118
But I can't go out there!

16:16.151 --> 16:18.155
Uh, ten second disguise, go!

16:18.189 --> 16:19.391
I've always meant
to try this out.

16:19.424 --> 16:21.061
It's ironic,
but now that I have

16:21.094 --> 16:23.165
the confidence to wear it,
I want you to have it.

16:23.199 --> 16:24.401
Please stop talking.

16:24.434 --> 16:26.038
She learns fast.

16:26.071 --> 16:27.140
Here, take care of her.

16:27.173 --> 16:29.044
How is your mustache a her?

16:29.077 --> 16:31.583
I have this rule
where I call anything "her"

16:31.616 --> 16:33.419
when it's more feminine
than you.

16:35.791 --> 16:37.761
There, exit vehicle.

16:37.795 --> 16:40.099
But I can't hotwire it
that fast.

16:40.132 --> 16:44.441
For all it's faults, IIA
does have very good scientists.

16:44.474 --> 16:46.713
Yeah, that totally outweighs
the soul crushing evil.

16:46.746 --> 16:47.748
Let's go!

16:54.361 --> 16:55.597
Where are you going?

16:57.066 --> 16:59.639
Ugh!
Why are you torturing me?

16:59.672 --> 17:01.643
For the same reason
people climb Everest.

17:01.676 --> 17:03.212
Because they're awesome.

17:13.667 --> 17:14.735
Where to now?

17:14.769 --> 17:16.506
Ray,
need that emergency exit,

17:16.539 --> 17:18.209
one minute exactly.

17:18.242 --> 17:21.181
Shut up and do it
just like we planned, mark.

17:21.215 --> 17:22.217
Make a left!

17:44.160 --> 17:45.396
Shit, I lost comms!

17:54.247 --> 17:55.416
Where am I going, Lana?

17:55.449 --> 17:56.485
20 seconds.

17:56.519 --> 17:57.621
"To what?" he said,

17:57.655 --> 17:59.257
knowing the answer was death.

17:59.291 --> 18:00.827
Go! 15 seconds.

18:06.539 --> 18:08.175
Ten!
- Why are you counting down?

18:08.208 --> 18:09.578
I feel very
out of the loop here.

18:09.612 --> 18:11.148
Oh, imagine that.

18:11.181 --> 18:12.551
Not needed, Fabian.

18:12.584 --> 18:14.154
Head off the bridge
at the third pillar.

18:14.187 --> 18:15.289
Ray's got us.

18:15.323 --> 18:17.160
Are we really trusting
Ray on this?

18:17.193 --> 18:19.832
Three, two, one, now!

18:24.174 --> 18:27.113
Oh shiiit!

18:31.856 --> 18:33.425
Trust me now?

18:33.459 --> 18:35.363
60/40.

18:36.866 --> 18:38.469
What are you idiots doing?

18:38.503 --> 18:40.206
Please hold.
It's for you.

18:40.239 --> 18:41.542
Congratulations!

18:41.576 --> 18:44.280
I'm gonna spend the rest
of my life ruining yours.

18:44.314 --> 18:46.819
And you can kiss your
little shitbox agency goodbye.

18:46.853 --> 18:48.690
I can't count how many times
you've threatened

18:48.723 --> 18:50.426
to take the agency from me, Slater.

18:50.459 --> 18:52.463
So let me say this.

18:52.497 --> 18:54.434
Fuck your muffins.

18:58.342 --> 19:01.315
Honestly,
not the worst mission I've run.

19:01.348 --> 19:03.319
In South America.

19:03.352 --> 19:04.722
This year.

19:06.793 --> 19:08.462
And we will take it
from here.

19:08.495 --> 19:10.299
Interpol?

19:10.333 --> 19:11.736
You guys are still a thing?

19:11.769 --> 19:13.707
Enough of a thing
that we can pass what we know

19:13.740 --> 19:15.209
along to the U. S. government

19:15.242 --> 19:17.614
and clear your names,
if we wanted to.

19:17.648 --> 19:19.518
And you say...

19:19.552 --> 19:21.221
Thank you.
We would like that.

19:21.254 --> 19:22.624
Ah, that's a good lad.

19:22.658 --> 19:24.628
Interpol? What is that?

19:24.662 --> 19:26.231
Some kind of
airfreight service

19:26.264 --> 19:28.837
that brings penguins
to hungry polar bears?

19:28.870 --> 19:30.774
- No.
- Well, it should be.

19:30.807 --> 19:33.713
You puny, second-rate idiots!

19:33.747 --> 19:35.216
You think this will stop me?

19:35.249 --> 19:37.721
I cannot be defeated,
only delayed!

19:37.755 --> 19:39.525
Uh, excuse me, there's--.

19:39.558 --> 19:41.395
No, Cyril, let the man speak.

19:41.428 --> 19:43.633
When you see me next,
it will be the moment

19:43.666 --> 19:45.504
that your life...

19:45.537 --> 19:48.242
pl--plunges into, uh...

19:48.275 --> 19:49.779
Plunges into what?

19:50.981 --> 19:52.751
Spider bite!

19:52.785 --> 19:54.387
Oh, don't be a baby.

19:54.421 --> 19:56.526
Wait,
I still have one question.

19:58.295 --> 20:00.232
Uh, what now?

20:00.266 --> 20:02.671
Fabian did actually deposit
two months of financial runway

20:02.705 --> 20:04.207
into our account.

20:04.240 --> 20:05.744
Though it was just
to frame us, so...

20:05.777 --> 20:07.413
So we're, like, a thing again?

20:07.447 --> 20:08.650
Well, but who's in charge?

20:08.683 --> 20:10.286
Do we take a vote or something?

20:10.319 --> 20:11.656
No, we don't.

20:11.689 --> 20:13.660
Now we all know
that I am the greatest spy,

20:13.693 --> 20:14.929
not only in the world,

20:14.962 --> 20:15.964
but in the history
of the world.

20:15.997 --> 20:17.366
Oh, my God.

20:17.400 --> 20:18.570
But when it comes
to strategy,

20:18.603 --> 20:20.406
Lana got us out of there,

20:20.439 --> 20:22.711
and made a deal with Interpol
to clear our names.

20:22.745 --> 20:24.849
Lana, the chair is yours.

20:24.882 --> 20:27.286
Wow. Thank you, Archer.

20:27.320 --> 20:28.790
That really means a lot.

20:31.562 --> 20:34.267
Besides, I wanna drink and
screw and not be responsible,

20:34.300 --> 20:36.506
and there's no way I can do it
from that chair.

20:36.539 --> 20:37.641
Plus Lana,
you won't be in the way

20:37.674 --> 20:38.943
as much in the field.

20:38.977 --> 20:40.847
I am not giving up the field.

20:40.881 --> 20:42.283
Can I change my mind?

20:42.316 --> 20:43.987
Speaking as your boss,
no, you cannot.

20:44.020 --> 20:45.557
I accept that.

20:45.590 --> 20:47.427
Hey, Mother would be proud...

20:47.460 --> 20:49.464
of both of us.

20:49.497 --> 20:51.468
Let me say this.

20:51.502 --> 20:54.340
Miss Kane,
you are my supervisor.

20:54.374 --> 20:56.746
Does this mean that you're
actually gonna listen to me?

20:56.779 --> 20:59.585
- I'm sorry, what?
- So what's next?

20:59.618 --> 21:02.423
Actually, I have a few ideas
about that.

21:07.066 --> 21:08.570
So what are they?

21:08.603 --> 21:09.972
It's weird that you paused
right there.

21:10.005 --> 21:12.678
We all agree that's weird, right?

21:16.519 --> 21:17.554
Just a weird pause.

21:37.928 --> 21:41.001
Made in Georgia.
