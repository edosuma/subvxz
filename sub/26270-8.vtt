WEBVTT

00:01.902 --> 00:03.171
-9-1-1. What's your emergency?
-(siren wailing)

00:03.204 --> 00:05.206
Let's get him out of here
before this thing blows!

00:05.239 --> 00:07.041
Catch all-new episodes Mondays,

00:07.075 --> 00:08.842
and check out
our other Fox programs--

00:08.876 --> 00:12.012
Empire, The Resident,
and The Gifted.

00:12.046 --> 00:14.582
We are going to show you
the dawn of a new age.

00:14.615 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:18.386 --> 00:19.853
If you're just joining us,
the morning commute

00:19.887 --> 00:21.889
has gotten a little
more dramatic over on the 5.

00:21.922 --> 00:24.225
Let's check in
with Channel 8's Taylor Kelly,

00:24.258 --> 00:26.227
who is on the ground.
Taylor?

00:26.260 --> 00:28.229
Ann, Dwight,
traffic at this exit

00:28.262 --> 00:30.564
came to a screeching halt
about ten minutes ago.

00:30.598 --> 00:34.868
But CHP is telling me the backup
is already a mile long.

00:34.902 --> 00:36.537
Why the sudden stop?

00:36.570 --> 00:38.772
This woman.
We don't know her name,

00:38.806 --> 00:40.741
but we do know
she is desperately trying

00:40.774 --> 00:43.277
to get the attention
of somebody named Norman.

00:43.311 --> 00:45.613
First responders
are just arriving to the scene

00:45.646 --> 00:48.282
and hopefully executing a plan
to get this woman

00:48.316 --> 00:51.352
back down to earth
and traffic back on the move.

00:51.385 --> 00:53.687
Reporting live,
this is Taylor Kelly,

00:53.721 --> 00:55.556
Channel 8 Morning News.

00:55.589 --> 00:59.760
Hell no! I won't come down
until Norman sees me!

00:59.793 --> 01:01.895
And don't you try
to force me down!

01:01.929 --> 01:04.465
ATHENA:
Nobody's gonna force you
to do anything.

01:04.498 --> 01:05.933
We're just gonna talk.

01:05.966 --> 01:07.435
What's your name?

01:07.468 --> 01:08.602
Lola!

01:08.636 --> 01:09.903
Lola,

01:09.937 --> 01:12.240
my name's Athena.

01:12.273 --> 01:14.475
-What's the problem?
-The problem?

01:14.508 --> 01:17.811
The problem is,
after 30 years of marriage,

01:17.845 --> 01:21.882
I can't get 30 seconds
of attention from my husband!

01:21.915 --> 01:25.119
It's like I'm invisible!

01:25.153 --> 01:27.155
But I'm-I'm not invisible!

01:27.188 --> 01:28.922
I am here, damn it!

01:28.956 --> 01:29.957
See me, Norman!

01:29.990 --> 01:31.058
See me now?!

01:31.091 --> 01:32.960
(cheering, applause)

01:32.993 --> 01:34.128
Oh, for God's sake.

01:34.162 --> 01:35.929
-Definitely not invisible.
-(sighs)

01:35.963 --> 01:38.399
Can somebody
please find me this Norman

01:38.432 --> 01:42.303
before she does
something crazy... er?

01:42.336 --> 01:44.104
-(horns honking)
-(indistinct chatter)

01:44.138 --> 01:45.939
(groans)

01:47.808 --> 01:51.279
(sighs)
Un-friggin'-believable.

02:00.454 --> 02:02.323
(indistinct chatter continuing)

02:02.356 --> 02:03.757
(laughing)

02:03.791 --> 02:06.194
LOLA (on phone):
...after 30 years of marriage,

02:06.227 --> 02:07.528
I can't get 30 seconds...

02:07.561 --> 02:09.163
Hey, how are you?
Can I get a...

02:09.197 --> 02:11.799
maybe a large coffee
and a bear claw?

02:11.832 --> 02:14.435
Oh, hey.
Do you know what's going on?

02:14.468 --> 02:16.870
Yeah, some lady up there
thought social media wasn't,

02:16.904 --> 02:19.507
like, social enough, and
so she's blowing up her marriage

02:19.540 --> 02:21.342
-in real time.
-Oh, no. (chuckles)

02:21.375 --> 02:23.677
This Norman guy is screwed.

02:23.711 --> 02:27.215
-See me, Norman? See me now?!
-(laughing)

02:27.248 --> 02:29.317
NORMAN:
Oh, God.

02:32.085 --> 02:34.855
MADDIE:
911. What is your emergency?

02:34.888 --> 02:37.024
NORMAN:
Yeah, it's my wife.
She's lost her mind.

02:37.057 --> 02:39.026
She's-she's on a freeway sign.

02:39.059 --> 02:40.828
Norman? Is that you?

02:40.861 --> 02:43.364
Yes, this is Norman.
This is Norman!

02:43.397 --> 02:44.365
Norman, where are you?

02:44.398 --> 02:45.833
Stuck in the backup.

02:45.866 --> 02:46.700
One exit south.

02:46.734 --> 02:48.569
I'm sending someone to you.

02:49.370 --> 02:51.239
(speaking indistinctly)

02:51.272 --> 02:52.540
Lola, good news.

02:52.573 --> 02:54.875
We found your man.
He's on his way.

02:54.908 --> 02:57.711
I won't come down
until he sees me!

02:57.745 --> 02:59.880
Ma'am, you're
the most famous face

02:59.913 --> 03:01.582
in the city right now.
There ain't exactly

03:01.615 --> 03:04.552
-a way to miss you.
-I don't care.

03:04.585 --> 03:07.621
Okay, move Buck into position.

03:08.756 --> 03:10.424
Okay, Chim.

03:12.593 --> 03:15.062
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

03:15.095 --> 03:16.397
What are you doing?!

03:16.430 --> 03:18.165
I-I told you!

03:18.198 --> 03:20.668
-I told you!
-It's just there
for your safety, Lola.

03:20.701 --> 03:22.403
-I-I told you!
-(grunts)

03:22.436 --> 03:23.804
I told...
(grunts)

03:25.406 --> 03:27.708
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!

03:27.741 --> 03:30.378
Stand down.
Do not shoot.

03:30.411 --> 03:33.247
-(grunts)
-Hey, hey, hey, hey.

03:33.281 --> 03:35.716
Lola, listen to me
very carefully.

03:35.749 --> 03:38.252
You now have every firearm
in the Greater Los Angeles area

03:38.286 --> 03:40.220
pointed at you.
If you continue

03:40.254 --> 03:42.055
to threaten that man,

03:42.089 --> 03:44.425
they will fire.

03:44.458 --> 03:46.059
Do you understand?

03:46.093 --> 03:48.296
Do you?

03:52.300 --> 03:54.802
I don't want to hurt anybody.

03:55.669 --> 03:56.937
I just can't handle

03:56.970 --> 03:58.939
being ignored anymore.

04:04.312 --> 04:06.914
I know exactly what you mean.

04:06.947 --> 04:08.716
Oh, come on.

04:08.749 --> 04:11.285
Yes, I'm-I'm sure
you get ignored all the time.

04:11.319 --> 04:12.753
You have a Norman.

04:12.786 --> 04:14.822
I had an Abby.

04:17.658 --> 04:19.727
He's talking to her?

04:19.760 --> 04:22.830
Yeah, that's either
gonna go well or...

04:22.863 --> 04:24.465
the other thing.

04:24.498 --> 04:26.734
You think that
you have something...

04:26.767 --> 04:28.469
something special, you know?

04:28.502 --> 04:30.137
She's the one.

04:30.170 --> 04:31.472
So you wait.

04:31.505 --> 04:34.241
And then, at some point,
it hits you:

04:34.274 --> 04:35.676
you're alone.

04:35.709 --> 04:37.077
Sh-She's not coming back.

04:37.110 --> 04:38.979
You're just there
to collect the mail,

04:39.012 --> 04:41.148
and-and it is piling up, right?

04:41.181 --> 04:43.751
And then-and then
you realize... (stammers)

04:43.784 --> 04:45.419
"You know what?

04:45.453 --> 04:47.254
It's over."

04:47.287 --> 04:50.724
You just need to face it
and move on.

04:51.859 --> 04:53.327
(sighs)

04:53.361 --> 04:55.829
(engine revving)

04:58.031 --> 04:58.832
You Norman?

04:58.866 --> 05:00.868
Yeah. I'm-I'm Norman.

05:00.901 --> 05:02.302
I don't know
why this is happening.

05:02.336 --> 05:03.804
We don't even fight.

05:03.837 --> 05:05.673
I'm pretty sure
that's why this is happening.

05:05.706 --> 05:08.742
-Wait, seriously?
-All right, come with me.

05:12.413 --> 05:13.847
(feedback)

05:13.881 --> 05:15.649
Uh, L-Lola.

05:15.683 --> 05:17.618
Lola, honey, it's me.

05:17.651 --> 05:20.354
I'm here.
And I see you,

05:20.388 --> 05:22.690
-just like the sign says.
-Liar!

05:22.723 --> 05:25.359
You look right through me.

05:25.393 --> 05:26.894
Y-You don't even notice me.

05:26.927 --> 05:30.798
I-I'm just around to...
collect the mail.

05:30.831 --> 05:32.800
I don't even know what that
means. I'm the one who brings in

05:32.833 --> 05:35.335
-the mail.
-Just talk to her.

05:35.369 --> 05:37.671
Lola, honey.

05:37.705 --> 05:40.207
Honey, now, listen to me.

05:40.240 --> 05:43.544
I-I'm here, and I see you.

05:43.577 --> 05:46.747
And I need you
to put down the gun, okay?

05:46.780 --> 05:49.383
Put the... put down the gun
and let them

05:49.417 --> 05:50.884
bring you to me.

05:50.918 --> 05:53.654
And then we can spend
the rest of our lives together,

05:53.687 --> 05:55.523
and I can show you
how much I love you.

05:55.556 --> 05:57.891
I don't believe you, Norman.

05:57.925 --> 06:01.228
You don't even know
who I am anymore.

06:01.261 --> 06:03.931
I mean... I don't even know.

06:03.964 --> 06:06.500
I'm-I'm confused. Now,
is she saying I don't see her

06:06.534 --> 06:08.936
or I don't know who she is,
like I don't recognize her?

06:08.969 --> 06:10.904
How the hell
am I supposed to know?

06:10.938 --> 06:13.273
She's your wife.

06:13.306 --> 06:17.177
I've been a mother for 18 years.

06:17.210 --> 06:19.046
And now that Zack's gone,

06:19.079 --> 06:22.950
I don't remember
who I was before that.

06:22.983 --> 06:26.119
Back when you used
to look at me.

06:32.292 --> 06:34.528
Maybe you're right.

06:34.562 --> 06:36.597
Maybe it is over.

06:36.630 --> 06:38.098
Uh, n-no, no, no, no, no.

06:38.131 --> 06:41.969
Um, okay, m-maybe
I wasn't being super clear

06:42.002 --> 06:43.971
on the point
I was trying to make...

06:44.004 --> 06:46.139
-(feedback)
-("In Your Eyes"
by Peter Gabriel playing)

07:00.287 --> 07:02.956
Oh, my God.
(sniffles)

07:02.990 --> 07:05.058
That song.

07:05.092 --> 07:07.461
* Love

07:07.495 --> 07:09.630
He remembered.

07:09.663 --> 07:11.632
* I get so lost

07:11.665 --> 07:14.568
It was our first date.

07:14.602 --> 07:17.571
We went to see S-Say Anything.

07:17.605 --> 07:19.172
NORMAN:
I see you.

07:20.273 --> 07:22.943
I see you.

07:22.976 --> 07:25.412
Lola, I see you.

07:25.445 --> 07:27.114
I see the girl

07:27.147 --> 07:29.817
who used to sneak out
to the beach bonfires

07:29.850 --> 07:31.485
and listen
to The Psychedelic Furs

07:31.519 --> 07:34.254
and The Cure.
Lola!

07:34.287 --> 07:35.656
Lola, I see you!

07:35.689 --> 07:37.457
I see the girl

07:37.491 --> 07:40.661
who once drank
nine shots of JÃ¤ger

07:40.694 --> 07:42.530
and woke up without a hangover!

07:42.563 --> 07:45.298
Lola, I see you.

07:45.332 --> 07:46.667
I see

07:46.700 --> 07:49.202
the girl I love!

07:49.236 --> 07:51.505
-* And the grand facade
-(cheering, applause)

07:51.539 --> 07:54.708
* So soon will burn

07:54.742 --> 07:56.610
Yes!
(laughing)

07:56.644 --> 07:57.611
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

07:57.645 --> 07:58.779
* Without my pride

07:58.812 --> 08:01.515
-(panting)
-It's okay.

08:01.549 --> 08:04.484
I think I want to get down now.

08:04.518 --> 08:06.987
*

08:09.322 --> 08:11.324
* In your eyes

08:11.358 --> 08:12.893
* The light, the heat

08:12.926 --> 08:16.396
-* In your eyes *
-* I am complete

08:16.429 --> 08:17.831
What'd you say to her?

08:17.865 --> 08:20.300
Just, you know...

08:20.333 --> 08:22.069
that everything's gonna be okay.

08:22.102 --> 08:24.337
-* The resolution
-* In your eyes *

08:24.371 --> 08:28.208
-* Of all
the fruitless searches *
-* In your eyes *

08:28.241 --> 08:32.145
-* In your eyes *
-* Oh, I see the light
and the heat *

08:32.179 --> 08:34.548
I'm sorry about all that.
It's just that...

08:34.582 --> 08:36.717
(chuckles)
he sees me.

08:36.750 --> 08:38.886
Norman sees me.

08:38.919 --> 08:42.022
Yeah, everyone
sees you now, Lola.

08:42.055 --> 08:45.726
Unfortunately, they're about
to see you get arrested.

08:45.759 --> 08:48.161
You have the right

08:48.195 --> 08:50.497
-to remain silent.
Anything you say
-(mouthing)

08:50.530 --> 08:53.533
can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

08:53.567 --> 08:55.435
-I love you.
-You have the right
to an attorney.

08:55.468 --> 08:58.305
If you do not have an attorney,
one will be appointed to you.

09:05.112 --> 09:06.513
* Oh-oh

09:06.546 --> 09:09.149
*

09:10.283 --> 09:13.253
You are really mashing
those potatoes.

09:13.286 --> 09:15.555
Uh, they're done.

09:15.589 --> 09:17.257
-So are you.
-(sighs)

09:17.290 --> 09:19.727
Just relax.
Everything's gonna be fine.

09:19.760 --> 09:21.194
We'll have a nice evening.
Good food.

09:21.228 --> 09:22.796
-Pleasant conversation.
-Yeah.

09:22.830 --> 09:25.365
Well, I'd rather be spending it
with just us.

09:25.398 --> 09:28.936
Not us and the kids
and my ex and his boyfriend.

09:28.969 --> 09:30.871
Thanks a lot, Mom.
I love you, too.

09:30.904 --> 09:31.939
-(Bobby chuckles)
-Oh, don't be smart. You know

09:31.972 --> 09:33.373
I didn't mean the two of you.

09:33.406 --> 09:34.942
I just feel bad
that you're spending

09:34.975 --> 09:37.277
your night off dealing
with our family drama.

09:37.310 --> 09:39.046
Well, didn't you reschedule this
three times

09:39.079 --> 09:41.214
so I could be here
to act as a human shield?

09:41.248 --> 09:43.216
(scoffs)
Are you shielding Mom or Glenn?

09:43.250 --> 09:44.117
Pleading the fifth.

09:44.151 --> 09:45.953
-(door opens)
-MICHAEL: Hey,

09:45.986 --> 09:47.655
we're here, everybody.

09:52.292 --> 09:53.460
There he is.

09:53.493 --> 09:55.128
-Mom,
-(Michael chuckles)

09:55.162 --> 09:57.898
I know this is awkward
and weird.

09:57.931 --> 10:00.300
But Glenn's a good guy.

10:00.333 --> 10:02.636
He makes Dad happy.

10:02.670 --> 10:05.605
Just give him a chance.

10:05.639 --> 10:07.274
(clicks tongue)

10:07.307 --> 10:09.242
Come on.

10:09.276 --> 10:11.111
She's right. Michael's been
very supportive of us.

10:11.144 --> 10:13.981
-Is this so different?
-Listen, if Michael had left me

10:14.014 --> 10:16.149
for another woman,
no one would expect me

10:16.183 --> 10:20.353
to slap on a fake smile
and welcome her into my home.

10:20.387 --> 10:22.255
Michael, Glenn,

10:22.289 --> 10:24.992
I am so glad
you were able to make it.

10:25.025 --> 10:26.694
I'm so glad to be here.
Thank you for having me.

10:26.727 --> 10:30.297
-(chuckling): Aw!
-(chuckles)

10:30.330 --> 10:31.965
(indistinct chatter)

10:31.999 --> 10:35.803
* I'm doing 28 to life *

10:35.836 --> 10:38.271
(whooping)

10:38.305 --> 10:42.042
* I'm watching day
turn into night *

10:42.075 --> 10:44.044
(indistinct chatter continuing)

10:44.077 --> 10:47.214
The world looks so different
now that I'm single again.

10:47.247 --> 10:49.449
-Buck, you've been single
for months.
-Yeah,

10:49.482 --> 10:52.319
only circumstantially. I know
Abby's been gone for a while,

10:52.352 --> 10:55.188
but, in my head, we've
been together this whole time.

10:55.222 --> 10:57.357
But now I'm out of her place...

10:57.390 --> 10:58.525
And living on my couch.

10:58.558 --> 11:00.060
Which I-I really appreciate.

11:00.093 --> 11:01.494
Happy to help. Even though
I did initially think

11:01.528 --> 11:03.296
you were just coming over
to watch the game.

11:03.330 --> 11:05.065
I'm just...
I'm nervous, you know?

11:05.098 --> 11:07.234
Are you afraid to get back
on the horse?

11:07.267 --> 11:08.702
I don't want to revert back

11:08.736 --> 11:11.371
to being Buck 1.0.

11:11.404 --> 11:14.474
-(phone vibrates)
-I-I know I'm single Buck again,
but I want

11:14.507 --> 11:17.044
to be single Buck 2.0.

11:17.077 --> 11:19.379
Like, if I'd come in here
with Abby,

11:19.412 --> 11:22.249
I would never have noticed
that blonde over there,

11:22.282 --> 11:24.651
licking the salted rim
of her margarita glass

11:24.684 --> 11:27.087
while she maintains strong,
intimate eye contact.

11:27.120 --> 11:28.722
Okay, is that really happening?

11:28.756 --> 11:30.357
Say I go over there, right?

11:30.390 --> 11:31.524
I, uh... I talk to her,

11:31.558 --> 11:33.426
I make a joke,
she smiles, we both laugh.

11:33.460 --> 11:35.996
Our-our shoulders touch,
there's a moment,

11:36.029 --> 11:38.398
I lean in a little closer,
she doesn't resist.

11:38.431 --> 11:41.601
One drink, two compliments
later, we end up in bed together

11:41.634 --> 11:43.403
having totally meaningless sex.

11:43.436 --> 11:45.105
Yeah, that sounds awful.

11:45.138 --> 11:47.407
I just... I don't want
to be that guy again.

11:47.440 --> 11:49.676
-So don't be.
-What can I get for you?

11:49.709 --> 11:51.779
Ah, just, uh, two IPAs, please.

11:51.812 --> 11:55.015
-And a glass of chardonnay.
-Gotcha.

11:55.048 --> 11:57.951
-Who's the wine for?
-Maddie. She was parking.

11:57.985 --> 12:00.788
Uh, you invited my sister?

12:00.821 --> 12:02.222
Hi. Sorry I'm late.
I don't know why

12:02.255 --> 12:04.224
I get on the freeway.
I always regret it.

12:04.257 --> 12:06.426
Because you are
an eternal optimist, that's why.

12:06.459 --> 12:08.261
-That's true.
-Are you hungry?

12:08.295 --> 12:10.363
Oh, yeah, should we get
that thing we got last time?

12:10.397 --> 12:13.433
-Uh, last time?
-Here we go.
-Ah, thank you.

12:13.466 --> 12:15.268
A Celine Deion Sanders
combo platter, please.

12:15.302 --> 12:17.437
-Oh. Good choice.
-Ah. Why, thank you.

12:17.470 --> 12:18.738
Thank you.

12:18.772 --> 12:21.741
Cheers. Cheers.

12:21.775 --> 12:23.877
MICHAEL:
Now, I think

12:23.911 --> 12:26.947
everyone at this table
has been a recipient

12:26.980 --> 12:29.817
of that, uh, Athena look.

12:29.850 --> 12:31.584
-Except for Glenn.
-MAY: Usually it means

12:31.618 --> 12:34.221
-you're gonna be yelled at.
-Or grounded.

12:34.254 --> 12:36.089
-Or, in this case, arrested.
-(laughter)

12:36.123 --> 12:37.891
What was she charged with?

12:37.925 --> 12:39.292
Assault with a firearm,

12:39.326 --> 12:42.262
gross negligence
in the discharge of a firearm,

12:42.295 --> 12:44.764
brandishing a weapon,
trespassing,

12:44.798 --> 12:47.067
indecent exposure,

12:47.100 --> 12:49.436
delaying a police officer
and failure

12:49.469 --> 12:51.471
-to obey a regulatory sign.
-MICHAEL: Wow.

12:51.504 --> 12:53.573
Is there anything
you didn't charge her with?

12:53.606 --> 12:56.176
-Well, she did manage
not to kill anyone.
-MAY: Hold on.

12:56.209 --> 12:58.745
-Who'd she assault?
-Buck.

12:58.778 --> 13:02.315
Pointing a firearm at someone
is considered an assault,

13:02.349 --> 13:04.684
according to Penal Code 245.

13:04.717 --> 13:07.620
I don't think Buck'd mind
if you guys drop those charges.

13:07.654 --> 13:09.422
He felt kind of bad for Lola.

13:09.456 --> 13:11.658
MICHAEL:
It was a stupid thing to do.

13:11.691 --> 13:14.327
But I don't know, you know?
Kind of sounds romantic,

13:14.361 --> 13:17.831
just to lay yourself down
for the world to see.

13:17.865 --> 13:21.134
ATHENA:
A candlelight dinner
is a romantic gesture, not a

13:21.168 --> 13:24.304
hostage situation
40 feet in the air.

13:24.337 --> 13:26.106
Well, she did
risk everything for love.

13:26.139 --> 13:28.508
-(exhales)
-You-you have to admire
her creativity,

13:28.541 --> 13:31.211
if nothing else. And she did get
her happy ending, sort of.

13:31.244 --> 13:34.347
-Then Mom arrested her.
-Mm-hmm. (chuckles)

13:34.381 --> 13:37.684
I'm with Athena on this one.

13:37.717 --> 13:40.153
When I saw that news story,

13:40.187 --> 13:41.688
all-all I could think about were

13:41.721 --> 13:43.556
the million different ways
it could've ended badly.

13:43.590 --> 13:45.893
Like, there could've been
a pile-up.

13:45.926 --> 13:48.228
-BOBBY: Mm-hmm.
-Or one of those bullets
might've ricocheted.

13:48.261 --> 13:50.063
What if someone
had a real emergency

13:50.097 --> 13:51.531
and help couldn't get to them

13:51.564 --> 13:53.633
because the freeway
was shut down? I mean,

13:53.666 --> 13:57.037
you guys did a great job,
but you also got pretty lucky.

13:57.070 --> 13:58.571
Thank you, Glenn.
You're the only one

13:58.605 --> 13:59.973
who gets the big picture.

14:00.007 --> 14:03.143
Ooh, would you like
some more wine?

14:03.176 --> 14:05.879
Sure. It's...
What is it? It's very good.

14:05.913 --> 14:07.347
Oh, I have some more
in the kitchen.

14:07.380 --> 14:09.349
-It was recommended to me.
-Okay.

14:09.382 --> 14:11.351
Well, I don't know much about
wines, but I know what I like.

14:11.384 --> 14:13.153
Well, neither do I,
but I found this great,

14:13.186 --> 14:15.722
-uh, wine shop that...
Oh, the owner's terrific.
-Okay.

14:15.755 --> 14:17.357
-Oh, that's great.
-Oh.

14:17.390 --> 14:20.593
*

14:20.627 --> 14:25.332
* Lady, when I met you
there was peace unknown *

14:25.365 --> 14:29.336
* I set out to get you
with a fine tooth comb *

14:29.369 --> 14:32.072
* I was soft inside

14:32.105 --> 14:36.109
* There was somethin' going on *

14:38.111 --> 14:40.280
* Tender love is blind

14:40.313 --> 14:42.582
* It requires a dedication

14:42.615 --> 14:45.552
-Uh, what's this?
-Bourbon, neat.

14:45.585 --> 14:48.355
The lady said real heroes
don't drink pale ale.

14:48.388 --> 14:50.857
CHIMNEY and MADDIE:
* We ride it together, uh-huh

14:50.890 --> 14:54.794
* Makin' love
with each other, uh-huh *

14:54.827 --> 14:56.763
(whooping, whistling)

14:56.796 --> 14:58.932
* Islands in the stream

14:58.966 --> 15:00.934
* That is what we are

15:00.968 --> 15:03.703
* No one in-between

15:03.736 --> 15:05.905
* How can we be wrong

15:05.939 --> 15:07.941
* Sail away with me

15:07.975 --> 15:11.078
* To another world,
and we rely... *

15:11.111 --> 15:13.380
I see Chimney's got
a girlfriend.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.648
No. No, he does not.
Uh, that-that's my sister.

15:15.682 --> 15:17.250
Oh. Sorry.

15:17.284 --> 15:20.620
They're kind of good.

15:20.653 --> 15:22.055
Yeah, I know, right?

15:22.089 --> 15:23.890
It's, uh, it's weird.

15:23.923 --> 15:27.394
So, hey, what-what's a-a fancy
TV reporter like you doing

15:27.427 --> 15:29.997
in a badge and ladder joint
like this?

15:30.030 --> 15:33.466
Stalking you, of course.
(chuckles)

15:33.500 --> 15:36.136
I'm kidding. The station
is right around the corner,

15:36.169 --> 15:39.006
and I like to keep my ear
to the ground.

15:39.039 --> 15:40.940
What about you?

15:40.974 --> 15:42.909
You come here a lot?

15:42.942 --> 15:45.145
Um, I-I used to,

15:45.178 --> 15:47.147
um, or places like it.

15:47.180 --> 15:49.582
-I-I haven't in a while.
-Why?

15:49.616 --> 15:52.152
I was in
a pretty serious relationship,

15:52.185 --> 15:56.523
uh, but that's over now,
I guess.

15:56.556 --> 15:58.091
You're not sure?

15:58.125 --> 15:59.492
I'm-I'm pretty sure.

15:59.526 --> 16:01.661
I'm actually even thinking

16:01.694 --> 16:03.763
about... dipping my toe

16:03.796 --> 16:06.633
-back into the dating game.
-Just your toe?

16:06.666 --> 16:09.502
-* In love forever
-(chuckles)

16:09.536 --> 16:12.772
* We can ride it together,
ah-ah... *

16:12.805 --> 16:14.607
Um... I'm just trying

16:14.641 --> 16:17.510
to be responsible
and well-behaved.

16:17.544 --> 16:21.014
You know, take it slow
and-and do it right.

16:21.048 --> 16:23.650
* Sail away with me

16:23.683 --> 16:26.519
-To restraint.
-* To another world...

16:26.553 --> 16:28.621
(chuckles)

16:28.655 --> 16:31.358
To restraint.

16:31.391 --> 16:33.860
* Islands in the stream

16:33.893 --> 16:35.862
* That is what we are

16:35.895 --> 16:38.398
* No one in-between

16:38.431 --> 16:40.367
* How can we be wrong

16:40.400 --> 16:45.138
* Sail away with me
to another world *

16:45.172 --> 16:49.476
* And we'll rely
on each other, uh-huh *

16:49.509 --> 16:51.511
* From one lover to another

16:51.544 --> 16:53.780
-* Uh-huh.
-(Taylor sighs)

17:00.587 --> 17:02.555
(sniffling)

17:03.423 --> 17:04.724
You ready, baby bear?

17:04.757 --> 17:06.493
(laughing):
Oh, I love you, boo boo.

17:06.526 --> 17:08.027
-Love you, too.
-Mmm.

17:08.061 --> 17:12.065
Let's go.
(sniffles)

17:12.099 --> 17:13.733
(woman laughs)

17:13.766 --> 17:17.904
This is Ruth at the Gas-N-Sip
at San Fernando and Vineland.

17:17.937 --> 17:19.739
Our store is about to be robbed.

17:19.772 --> 17:21.108
Again.

17:21.141 --> 17:23.443
Man and woman.
Seen the guy before.

17:23.476 --> 17:25.412
He buys
his lottery tickets here.

17:25.445 --> 17:28.281
He calls himself "Harley."
They're coming in.

17:28.315 --> 17:29.582
-Armed.
-(door bangs open)

17:29.616 --> 17:32.252
Nobody move!
It's a stick-up!

17:32.285 --> 17:33.786
Cash register, baby bear.

17:33.820 --> 17:36.423
-WOMAN: Okay, boo boo.
-Don't move!

17:36.456 --> 17:38.591
Stay put, Earl.
We're being robbed.

17:38.625 --> 17:40.093
-Again?
-Give her the cash!

17:40.127 --> 17:41.594
WOMAN:
Fill it up. (panting)

17:41.628 --> 17:44.731
-Hurry up.
-(register dings)

17:46.299 --> 17:48.801
I know it's you, Harley.

17:48.835 --> 17:50.770
Is this Margie or Darlene?

17:50.803 --> 17:52.972
Boo Boo,
what's she talking about?

17:53.005 --> 17:55.475
Oh, a new one.
He call you "baby bear," too?

17:55.508 --> 17:57.610
-You... Shut up, you!
-Boo boo, how many

17:57.644 --> 17:59.446
-baby bears are there?
-Just you!

17:59.479 --> 18:01.914
-(grunting)
-You're the only baby bear.

18:01.948 --> 18:05.118
-(grunting)
-Earl, don't be an idiot!

18:05.152 --> 18:06.953
Boo you!

18:06.986 --> 18:08.455
(groaning)

18:08.488 --> 18:10.223
Just let him go, Earl.

18:10.257 --> 18:12.759
Oh, shoot!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

18:12.792 --> 18:14.727
(grunts)

18:14.761 --> 18:17.830
(siren chirps,
siren wails)

18:21.834 --> 18:23.270
(grunting)

18:28.141 --> 18:29.542
(grunting)

18:38.851 --> 18:40.687
OFFICER (on bullhorn):
We've got you surrounded.

18:40.720 --> 18:43.790
-Come out with your hands up.
-Ow! Dumbass.

18:43.823 --> 18:45.325
(grunts)

18:45.358 --> 18:47.660
(groaning)

18:49.529 --> 18:51.231
Who's the dumbass now?

18:55.702 --> 18:57.204
(groaning)

18:57.237 --> 18:59.806
(creaking)

18:59.839 --> 19:02.209
-You have a back door?
-RUTH: Locked.

19:02.242 --> 19:04.344
Ain't getting out that way.

19:09.416 --> 19:11.984
727-L-30 request R.A. unit

19:12.018 --> 19:13.920
to the Gas-N-Sip
on San Fernando.

19:16.923 --> 19:19.992
I have a suspect about to be
in need of medical attention.

19:20.026 --> 19:21.994
(indistinct dispatcher response)

19:22.028 --> 19:23.730
Aah!

19:23.763 --> 19:25.232
(grunts)

19:25.265 --> 19:27.900
(siren wailing)

19:32.539 --> 19:33.806
BOBBY:
Seriously, you're telling me

19:33.840 --> 19:35.408
-Taylor Kelly, the reporter?
-Yeah.

19:35.442 --> 19:37.143
I didn't know you two
were seeing each other.

19:37.176 --> 19:40.213
We're not. I ran into her
in this bar, we're hanging out,

19:40.247 --> 19:42.682
and next thing I know, we're
having sex in the bathroom.

19:42.715 --> 19:44.251
I... kind of feel weird
about it.

19:44.284 --> 19:45.718
Yeah, which part?

19:45.752 --> 19:47.487
I just thought
I'd stopped being that guy.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.222
I thought Abby had changed me.

19:49.256 --> 19:52.024
I'm single for, like, a day,
and I'm right back at it?

19:52.058 --> 19:54.727
Well, Buck,
you've been single for months.

19:54.761 --> 19:58.531
Why does everyone keep
saying that?

19:58.565 --> 20:01.568
Bonnie and Clyde
meets Dumb and Dumber.

20:01.601 --> 20:03.169
EDDIE:
He seems fine.

20:03.202 --> 20:05.772
Pupils are dilated.
Definitely high on something.

20:05.805 --> 20:07.574
Well, I'll try
to contain my shock.

20:07.607 --> 20:09.276
Get him out of here.

20:09.309 --> 20:10.743
Stay strong, baby bear.

20:10.777 --> 20:13.045
I'm not your baby bear, jackass.

20:13.079 --> 20:14.914
Men are the worst, right?

20:14.947 --> 20:17.016
(scoffs)
You're asking the wrong girl.

20:17.049 --> 20:19.752
I really like her, you know, and
not just 'cause she's a redhead,

20:19.786 --> 20:21.588
but now if I do want
to call and, you know,

20:21.621 --> 20:24.291
ask her out, she's gonna
think I'm only after one thing.

20:24.324 --> 20:26.759
You are only after one thing.
Jerk.

20:26.793 --> 20:30.096
-You don't even know me.
-You're a man. I know enough.

20:30.129 --> 20:32.732
She's been read her rights.
I'll meet y'all at the hospital.

20:32.765 --> 20:34.867
Can I get a little something
for the pain?

20:34.901 --> 20:37.036
Pretty sure you took that
before you walked in here.

20:37.069 --> 20:39.772
-They're gonna take you
to the hospital, Earl.
-I'm fine, really.

20:39.806 --> 20:41.574
BOBBY:
Sir, we heard you took
quite a tumble.

20:41.608 --> 20:43.976
-We'd feel a lot better
if you got checked out.
-You've already

20:44.010 --> 20:46.613
been a hero once today, Earl.
Don't push your luck.

20:46.646 --> 20:49.215
You thought I was being heroic?

20:49.248 --> 20:51.418
Well... yeah.

20:51.451 --> 20:53.486
A bit stupid, but heroic.

20:53.520 --> 20:56.088
I was only
thinking of you, Ruth.

20:58.658 --> 21:00.793
Next time,
let 'em keep the till.

21:00.827 --> 21:02.962
Kind of like having you around.

21:10.303 --> 21:12.439
(Buck sighs)

21:24.150 --> 21:26.453
Long day?

21:26.486 --> 21:28.488
Well, you know,

21:28.521 --> 21:31.591
the long days are the ones
without a car chase.

21:31.624 --> 21:32.992
Yeah, Cap always says
it's strange

21:33.025 --> 21:36.295
to hope for boring,
but... we do.

21:36.329 --> 21:39.098
I'm just trying to get people
not to change the channel

21:39.131 --> 21:40.667
at the words, "city council."

21:40.700 --> 21:42.702
-(chuckles)
-Why?

21:42.735 --> 21:45.137
-You got a story for me?
-How about

21:45.171 --> 21:49.041
"Firefighter Acts Like a Pig"?

21:49.075 --> 21:52.545
Um, the other night,

21:52.579 --> 21:55.348
w-we were drinking, and I...

21:55.382 --> 21:57.484
I don't know, I...

21:57.517 --> 21:59.519
I was working through
some stuff.

21:59.552 --> 22:00.953
I-I just,
I don't want you to feel...

22:00.987 --> 22:04.957
Buck. Did you come here
to apologize?

22:04.991 --> 22:08.395
I-I just don't want you to feel
used or-or taken advantage of.

22:08.428 --> 22:11.197
Because I respect you, you know?
I-I do. You're a professional,

22:11.230 --> 22:12.665
and th-that guy, that's not me.

22:12.699 --> 22:14.133
It used to be me.

22:14.166 --> 22:16.335
I'm a grown woman, Buck.

22:16.369 --> 22:17.904
And I'm the one

22:17.937 --> 22:21.073
who sent you
the drink, remember?

22:21.107 --> 22:22.875
(chuckles)

22:22.909 --> 22:26.979
Uh, fair enough.

22:27.013 --> 22:30.082
I guess I can
take karaoke bathroom

22:30.116 --> 22:31.384
off my bucket list.

22:31.418 --> 22:34.554
Okay.

22:34.587 --> 22:36.523
So you want to grab a drink?

22:36.556 --> 22:40.427
Mm. Some other time, maybe?

22:40.460 --> 22:42.094
I got a piece I got to cut.

22:42.128 --> 22:45.998
The Burbank Library
is getting a new mural.

22:46.032 --> 22:47.133
(chuckles)

22:50.236 --> 22:53.806
Yep, have a good night.

22:56.443 --> 22:57.710
(mutters)

22:59.278 --> 23:01.448
What about a news van?

23:03.049 --> 23:04.917
Where's that on
your bucket list?

23:06.486 --> 23:08.254
* Every kiss is a door

23:08.287 --> 23:10.590
Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait.
I-I don't want you to think

23:10.623 --> 23:12.024
I don't respect you.

23:12.058 --> 23:14.594
-Yeah, yeah. I'll deal with it.
-All right.

23:14.627 --> 23:16.429
* If a touch is a key

23:16.463 --> 23:18.631
-(phone dinging)
-* Keep on twisting

23:18.665 --> 23:21.233
* Keep unlocking,
keep on turning me *

23:21.267 --> 23:24.537
* Let me in

23:24.571 --> 23:26.606
Oh.

23:26.639 --> 23:28.207
Sorry, stud, I got to run.

23:28.240 --> 23:31.310
Five-alarm fire in Brentwood.

23:31.343 --> 23:33.245
Wait, y-you're going to a fire?

23:33.279 --> 23:35.715
Ironic, huh? Sorry.

23:35.748 --> 23:37.750
-I got your text.
-Then let's hustle it up.

23:37.784 --> 23:40.286
-Hey.
-Hey.

23:40.319 --> 23:41.788
* Break it then you buy it

23:41.821 --> 23:44.323
-TAYLOR: Go.
-(engine starts)

23:44.356 --> 23:45.424
TAYLOR:
Thanks, Buck.

23:45.458 --> 23:46.959
Call me?

23:46.993 --> 23:48.961
* You gon' love it
if you try it *

23:48.995 --> 23:50.830
* Got you hooked,
now you're caught up. *

23:57.436 --> 23:59.539
(sirens wailing)

24:09.148 --> 24:10.316
What do we got?

24:10.349 --> 24:11.584
ATHENA:
Couple of newlyweds.

24:11.618 --> 24:13.252
Driver's Paul Williams.

24:13.285 --> 24:14.687
No ID on the passenger.

24:14.721 --> 24:16.623
Another car drifted
into their lane,

24:16.656 --> 24:18.658
the driver tried to avoid
getting hit,

24:18.691 --> 24:20.927
car went off the road.

24:20.960 --> 24:24.664
Bobby, it's bad. Car's wrapped
tight around that tree.

24:24.697 --> 24:27.433
BOBBY:
Come on, guys, hustle up.
Driver's name is Paul.

24:27.466 --> 24:30.069
BUCK:
Damn, the tree's folded
right into the car.

24:33.305 --> 24:36.142
Paul, can you hear me?

24:36.175 --> 24:38.711
(firemen grunting)

24:38.745 --> 24:40.980
BOBBY:
Eddie, see if you can reach her.

24:43.883 --> 24:46.018
EDDIE:
I got a pulse. She's alive.

24:46.052 --> 24:47.720
I don't have a clear path
to the groom.

24:47.754 --> 24:49.355
Cap, can you get in
from your side?

24:49.388 --> 24:50.657
Negative.

24:50.690 --> 24:52.124
Hen, Chim,
we're gonna need Jaws.

24:52.158 --> 24:54.360
(on radio):
Two passengers in bad shape.

24:54.393 --> 24:56.362
One confirmed alive.

24:56.395 --> 24:57.897
No access to the other.

24:57.930 --> 24:59.198
BUCK:
Paul! Can you hear me?

24:59.231 --> 25:01.033
It's LAFD.

25:01.067 --> 25:02.234
(Paul moans)

25:02.268 --> 25:04.170
I got him. I hear him.
He's alive.

25:04.203 --> 25:06.038
BOBBY:
All right. Make that two.
Both alive.

25:06.072 --> 25:08.007
Let's keep 'em that way, guys.

25:17.349 --> 25:18.250
(grunts)
Take that.

25:18.284 --> 25:20.252
Okay, pull her out!

25:31.030 --> 25:32.865
CHIMNEY:
It's not good.

25:32.899 --> 25:35.768
BOBBY:
All right. All right, Chim.

25:37.469 --> 25:38.705
HEN:
Up.

25:38.738 --> 25:40.773
BOBBY:
All right, be careful with her.

25:42.108 --> 25:44.543
Okay, I got an open
femoral fracture, right leg.

25:44.577 --> 25:45.878
And probably a broken pelvis.

25:45.912 --> 25:46.913
Cap, we got to move her!

25:46.946 --> 25:49.616
On three. One, two, three.

25:49.649 --> 25:51.250
BOBBY:
It's getting dark.

25:51.283 --> 25:54.320
Let's get some lights down here
and put a step on it.

25:57.289 --> 26:00.392
EDDIE:
Hang in there, Paul.
We're gonna get you out.

26:00.426 --> 26:03.896
-CHIMNEY: You ready? Damn,
there's a much tree here as car.
-Yep.

26:03.930 --> 26:05.665
BOBBY:
Easy.

26:07.634 --> 26:09.836
EDDIE:
Easy, fellas.

26:12.805 --> 26:14.206
He's breathing shallow.

26:14.240 --> 26:17.276
Pulse is weak,
he's lost a lot of blood.

26:17.309 --> 26:20.212
So... tired.

26:20.246 --> 26:21.648
EDDIE:
No, no, no, no, no.

26:21.681 --> 26:23.616
Yeah. Hey, hey, hey.

26:23.650 --> 26:26.619
Hey, tell me about Katy.
How'd you guys meet, huh?

26:26.653 --> 26:29.288
-Summer camp.
-Yeah?

26:29.321 --> 26:31.257
We were... six.

26:31.290 --> 26:33.125
He's running out of time.
What's the plan?

26:33.159 --> 26:35.061
Still working on it.
It's like this thing

26:35.094 --> 26:37.063
went through a crusher
with him still inside.

26:37.096 --> 26:39.165
W-We can't just cut him out.

26:42.201 --> 26:45.805
Well, if we can't
cut him out of the car...

26:45.838 --> 26:47.373
let's get rid of the car.

26:48.507 --> 26:50.109
All right, guys, let's go.

26:50.142 --> 26:52.645
One end to the fire truck,
the other end to the tow truck.

26:52.679 --> 26:55.014
-CHIMNEY: All right.
-BOBBY:
Let's pull this thing apart.

27:01.487 --> 27:02.621
All right.

27:02.655 --> 27:03.823
-Got it? All right.
-Yeah.

27:03.856 --> 27:06.458
You really think
this is gonna work?

27:06.492 --> 27:07.860
It's all we got.

27:07.894 --> 27:09.996
All right, Eddie, Chim.
Clear the vehicle.

27:10.029 --> 27:12.765
-We secure?
-Yep.

27:12.799 --> 27:15.101
All right. Set? Set?

27:15.134 --> 27:17.203
All right, let's go!

27:19.338 --> 27:22.141
More.

27:22.174 --> 27:23.676
Slow.

27:23.710 --> 27:25.177
Careful.

27:25.211 --> 27:26.679
All right, we got it.
Let's go!

27:26.713 --> 27:28.314
Body board.

27:33.820 --> 27:36.188
Let's get you
out of here, buddy.

27:36.222 --> 27:37.356
(grunting)

27:37.389 --> 27:39.325
(groaning, whimpering)

27:42.695 --> 27:43.996
All right.

27:44.030 --> 27:45.865
One, two, three, up.

27:55.007 --> 27:56.308
PAUL:
Katy?

27:56.342 --> 27:58.745
We're taking you
to her now, buddy.

28:02.514 --> 28:04.917
Can't believe
you got him out alive.

28:04.951 --> 28:06.819
When I saw that car...

28:06.853 --> 28:08.855
I know. Me too.

28:08.888 --> 28:10.857
Tow trucks.

28:10.890 --> 28:12.391
How did you even
come up with that?

28:12.424 --> 28:16.028
"What God has put together,
let no man put asunder."

28:16.062 --> 28:18.264
The wedding ceremony.

28:18.297 --> 28:20.432
Well, that was some
divine inspiration.

28:20.466 --> 28:22.902
Hey, even the big guy's
a sucker for a love story.

28:22.935 --> 28:25.071
(sirens chirp,
vehicles departing)

28:36.582 --> 28:38.450
Wait-- a news van?

28:38.484 --> 28:40.086
-Don't other people use that?
-(knocking)

28:40.119 --> 28:41.553
What if you get caught?

28:41.587 --> 28:42.755
She could get fired.

28:42.789 --> 28:45.057
-Your brother sure did.
-Hi.

28:45.091 --> 28:47.927
CHIMNEY:
Oh, he didn't tell you
about the time

28:47.960 --> 28:49.461
he stole a fire truck
from work

28:49.495 --> 28:52.031
-so he could have sex in it?
-Ugh.

28:52.064 --> 28:53.599
-Thank you for that.
-CHIMNEY: Anytime, roomie.

28:53.632 --> 28:55.467
MADDIE:
Damn it. They didn't
put it in here again.

28:55.501 --> 28:57.203
CHIMNEY:
Oh, uh...

28:57.236 --> 28:59.205
(sighs)

28:59.238 --> 29:00.606
Ta-da.

29:00.639 --> 29:02.441
You made me hot mustard.

29:02.474 --> 29:04.944
I just can't anymore, with
the whole sad face every time

29:04.977 --> 29:06.145
-they forget it, so...
-MADDIE: I know.

29:06.178 --> 29:08.280
Anyway, uh, why so much food?

29:08.314 --> 29:11.317
-Uh, it's Buffriday.
-Buffet Fridays.

29:11.350 --> 29:14.120
It's the one day we indulge your
sister's complete inability

29:14.153 --> 29:17.423
-to choose what she's in
the mood for.
-Yeah, so we order everything.

29:17.456 --> 29:20.059
And, because of your sister's
hatred for leftovers,

29:20.092 --> 29:21.560
I don't have to buy groceries.

29:21.593 --> 29:22.795
It's a win-win situation.

29:22.829 --> 29:24.163
Uh, let's go back
to you stealing

29:24.196 --> 29:25.965
a hook and ladder
for a hookup.

29:25.998 --> 29:27.733
It's your fault.
You know, you always told me

29:27.766 --> 29:29.501
to go after what I wanted.

29:29.535 --> 29:31.337
Be confident.
Girls aren't scary.

29:31.370 --> 29:35.241
Um, you were 11.
Don't you have impulse control?

29:35.274 --> 29:36.976
-And not sure
that's the problem.
-All I'm saying

29:37.009 --> 29:39.145
is she's beautiful, she's cool.

29:39.178 --> 29:41.480
And then she left me
standing in a parking lot.

29:41.513 --> 29:43.682
Yeah, I'm feeling
this is a little more karmic.

29:43.715 --> 29:46.452
Chickens coming home
to roost.

29:46.485 --> 29:48.855
(laughs)
You've been Bucked.

29:48.888 --> 29:52.358
Buck 2.0 has found himself
a Buckette 1.0.

29:52.391 --> 29:55.694
Dude, you're dating yourself.

29:55.727 --> 29:57.463
We're not dating, okay?

29:59.531 --> 30:01.834
But you two are.

30:01.868 --> 30:03.836
You guys are...

30:03.870 --> 30:05.371
-dating each other.
-(both laugh)

30:05.404 --> 30:07.039
That's crazy. We're...

30:07.073 --> 30:08.674
-Friends who hang out.
-Yeah. Just hanging out.

30:08.707 --> 30:11.310
No. Y-You're always talking
or texting each other.

30:11.343 --> 30:12.879
You sing karaoke together.

30:12.912 --> 30:16.515
You do Buffridays, you finish
each other's sentences.

30:16.548 --> 30:17.984
Guys, come on,
you're a couple.

30:18.017 --> 30:19.351
-Wh-When did...
-(phone vibrates)

30:22.221 --> 30:25.224
(sighs)
Yeah, this is Buck.

30:26.859 --> 30:30.196
Oh, uh...

30:30.229 --> 30:31.563
Hey.

30:31.597 --> 30:34.833
How-how you doing?

30:34.867 --> 30:37.069
Uh, good. Good.

30:38.871 --> 30:40.672
Um, coffee.

30:40.706 --> 30:44.743
Uh, yeah, I'm-I'm not sure
that's such a good idea.

30:44.776 --> 30:47.479
I-I have a shift
tomorrow, and...

30:47.513 --> 30:49.748
Yeah. I-I will.

30:49.781 --> 30:52.051
All right.
All right.

30:52.084 --> 30:54.220
Good-bye.

30:58.290 --> 31:00.426
Being Buck 2.0 sucks.

31:01.127 --> 31:03.229
Happy anniversary, love.

31:03.262 --> 31:04.596
Ah.

31:06.198 --> 31:08.700
To all our many adventures.

31:08.734 --> 31:11.570
-And the many yet to come.
-It's been

31:11.603 --> 31:15.774
a long life
and a short marriage.

31:15.807 --> 31:17.076
For once, in both,

31:17.109 --> 31:21.047
could you do a damn dish?

31:21.080 --> 31:22.248
(chuckles)

31:25.484 --> 31:27.954
Mm.

31:31.090 --> 31:33.092
* Strictly business

31:33.125 --> 31:37.063
* Nothing more

31:37.096 --> 31:38.597
* As I held the door

31:38.630 --> 31:39.966
* Held the door *

31:39.999 --> 31:42.868
* What a saint walked in

31:42.901 --> 31:44.403
* Ah-ah, ah *

31:44.436 --> 31:47.974
* As two hears started dancing

31:48.007 --> 31:52.711
* A new story begins

31:52.744 --> 31:54.713
(sighs)

31:54.746 --> 31:58.384
* Oh, my poor soul

31:58.417 --> 32:01.553
* Starts flying like

32:01.587 --> 32:04.090
* A cannonball

32:04.123 --> 32:07.726
* What goes up

32:07.759 --> 32:11.897
* Must come down

32:11.930 --> 32:14.133
* Take my advice

32:14.166 --> 32:17.469
* And run while you still

32:17.503 --> 32:18.737
-* Can *
-* To the races

32:18.770 --> 32:20.772
* Got my love jumpstarted

32:20.806 --> 32:23.642
* The only one I want is you

32:23.675 --> 32:26.979
* Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh,
ooh-ooh *

32:27.013 --> 32:28.647
* Say it again, hey *

32:28.680 --> 32:31.450
* I hear the bells
and they're ringing already *

32:31.483 --> 32:33.819
* Four kids
and a big ol' wedding *

32:33.852 --> 32:37.489
* Singin', you... *

32:37.523 --> 32:39.358
* Say it again *

32:39.391 --> 32:42.194
-* Hey *
-* Now, as I make
the long walk home *

32:42.228 --> 32:45.197
* You got me feeling
like an overdose, singing *

32:45.231 --> 32:48.400
* You...

32:50.536 --> 32:52.938
* Hey, don't act surprised *

32:52.971 --> 32:56.175
* A goldfish
wouldn't love you twice *

32:56.208 --> 32:58.277
* And your gravity

32:58.310 --> 32:59.811
* My depravity

32:59.845 --> 33:02.814
* Won't take my advice *

33:02.848 --> 33:04.316
* I never run

33:04.350 --> 33:06.285
* While I still

33:06.318 --> 33:07.519
-* Can *
-* To the races

33:07.553 --> 33:08.954
* Got my love jumpstarted

33:08.987 --> 33:11.857
* The only one I want is

33:11.890 --> 33:14.693
* You...

33:16.495 --> 33:18.364
-* Hey *
-* I hear the bells

33:18.397 --> 33:19.998
* And they're ringing already *

33:20.032 --> 33:23.069
* Four kids and a big ol'
wedding, singing *

33:23.102 --> 33:25.337
* You...

33:25.371 --> 33:27.839
* Say it again *

33:27.873 --> 33:30.842
* Then my heart starts attackin'
and the arteries clappin' *

33:30.876 --> 33:33.512
* Trappin' all the bits
of poison in the mornin' *

33:33.545 --> 33:37.549
* I was sure that she was
slippin' me, damn, maybe *

33:37.583 --> 33:40.018
* What goes up

33:40.052 --> 33:43.855
* Must come down

33:43.889 --> 33:46.225
* Take my advice

33:46.258 --> 33:47.826
* And run

33:47.859 --> 33:49.761
* While you still...

33:49.795 --> 33:52.064
Shall we add...

33:52.098 --> 33:54.933
another memory
to the collection?

33:54.966 --> 33:57.336
-(chuckles)
-Hmm?

33:57.369 --> 33:59.871
It's a beautiful day.

33:59.905 --> 34:01.507
Hmm. Yeah.

34:01.540 --> 34:04.276
(chuckles)

34:07.613 --> 34:11.117
Thomas, we're stopping
at the studio

34:11.150 --> 34:13.285
to have these digitized.

34:13.319 --> 34:16.588
For the posterity
of online narcissism.

34:16.622 --> 34:18.257
Uh-oh.

34:18.290 --> 34:19.425
-What now?
-I've forgotten

34:19.458 --> 34:21.460
-the bloody helmets.
-(chuckles): Oh.

34:21.493 --> 34:22.694
(scoffs)

34:22.728 --> 34:24.596
Eh.

34:24.630 --> 34:25.797
Paper.

34:50.856 --> 34:53.792
-Sir, can you tell me
exactly what happened?
-My husband.

34:53.825 --> 34:56.495
He was outside,
and-and the car must have...

34:56.528 --> 34:58.630
I don't know,
it-it... it rolled.

34:58.664 --> 35:00.499
Perhaps I should move the car.

35:00.532 --> 35:03.602
Sir, I am being told that you
should not move the vehicle.

35:03.635 --> 35:05.904
-Just leave everything as it is.
-He's not breathing!

35:05.937 --> 35:08.340
-Help is on the way.
-He can't go.

35:08.374 --> 35:12.311
He's my heart, my everything.

35:17.048 --> 35:21.119
When we got married...

35:21.153 --> 35:23.255
we thought, what the hell,

35:23.289 --> 35:25.524
we have so little life left,

35:25.557 --> 35:27.826
we might as well live.

35:28.894 --> 35:30.596
That was Mitchell,

35:30.629 --> 35:33.565
always... daring the clock.

35:35.901 --> 35:39.571
And me, I always followed along.

35:40.706 --> 35:43.709
All those foolish things we did.

35:47.413 --> 35:50.115
We only ever wanted to...

35:50.148 --> 35:52.584
to go together.

35:56.555 --> 35:59.425
That's love.

36:00.826 --> 36:02.728
I'm sorry.

36:04.029 --> 36:05.931
I really am.

36:07.733 --> 36:11.403
I guess I can only hope
to find something that good.

36:11.437 --> 36:14.039
You don't find it, son.

36:14.072 --> 36:17.543
You make it.

36:17.576 --> 36:18.910
(sighs)

36:18.944 --> 36:21.580
Son, you mind if I have

36:21.613 --> 36:24.015
-just a few moments alone
with him?
-Of course.

36:24.049 --> 36:25.884
It's no problem. Here.

36:46.037 --> 36:48.574
My sweet Mitchell.

37:12.298 --> 37:13.965
Thomas?

37:15.100 --> 37:17.235
Uh, E-Eddie! Cap! Come here.

37:17.269 --> 37:18.937
I-I don't know what happened.

37:18.970 --> 37:21.139
He was just talking,
he was responsive,

37:21.172 --> 37:23.309
-and then...
-BOBBY:
All right, start compressions.

37:23.342 --> 37:24.776
Stay with us, Thomas.

37:24.810 --> 37:26.412
Go, go, go.

37:32.117 --> 37:33.552
Come on, Thomas.
Come on.

37:33.585 --> 37:35.354
Stay with me. Come on.

37:36.288 --> 37:39.124
Come on, Thomas.
Come on.

37:39.157 --> 37:40.926
Buck.

37:40.959 --> 37:42.761
He's gone, kid.

37:53.171 --> 37:55.106
That's love.

38:02.514 --> 38:04.316
(indistinct chatter)

38:04.350 --> 38:06.017
MAN:
911. What's your emergency?

38:14.726 --> 38:17.529
Oh, excuse me, um,
I'm looking for Maddie Buckley.

38:17.563 --> 38:19.698
Um... Kendall.

38:20.732 --> 38:22.067
Thanks.

38:30.041 --> 38:31.343
(clears throat)

38:31.377 --> 38:33.479
Hey.

38:34.546 --> 38:36.482
Oh, my God.
Is Buck okay?

38:36.515 --> 38:38.016
Yeah.

38:38.049 --> 38:41.186
No. I'm sorry.
Yes, uh, Buck is fine.

38:41.219 --> 38:43.054
Uh, he's an idiot,
but he's fine.

38:43.088 --> 38:45.791
I just came
to check on you, because...

38:45.824 --> 38:47.526
we really haven't talked.

38:47.559 --> 38:48.627
Yeah. It's okay. I...

38:48.660 --> 38:50.662
Buck was just being stupid.

38:50.696 --> 38:54.065
My life is a work in progress.

38:54.099 --> 38:55.534
It's a mess.

38:55.567 --> 38:58.370
I wouldn't expect anyone
to want to take that on.

38:58.404 --> 39:00.071
That's not it.

39:00.105 --> 39:02.073
Not at all, actually.

39:02.107 --> 39:03.709
Uh...

39:03.742 --> 39:06.044
I really care about you.

39:06.077 --> 39:09.415
Uh, I just didn't
want you to feel pressured,

39:09.448 --> 39:10.916
that I was pushing you
to something

39:10.949 --> 39:13.084
that you're not ready for.

39:14.520 --> 39:17.322
You never pushed.

39:17.355 --> 39:18.924
(chuckles)
Good.

39:18.957 --> 39:22.428
Um, and I also wanted you
to know that...

39:22.461 --> 39:24.563
I'm not worried
about your life before.

39:24.596 --> 39:27.566
I mean, I hate
that it happened, but...

39:27.599 --> 39:30.702
that would never scare me off.

39:30.736 --> 39:34.205
I might take you up on that.

39:34.239 --> 39:36.241
Someday.

39:36.274 --> 39:37.743
(chuckles softly)

39:37.776 --> 39:40.278
Good.
'Cause my calendar's...

39:40.311 --> 39:41.947
wide open.

39:47.285 --> 39:49.755
What's the occasion?

39:51.122 --> 39:54.059
Well, we've both been
so busy, I thought...

39:54.092 --> 39:57.395
we should spend a nice evening
at home, just the two of us.

39:57.429 --> 40:00.432
* Ooh, oh, oh...

40:00.466 --> 40:04.169
You are definitely a keeper.

40:06.638 --> 40:08.139
That's the occasion.

40:13.579 --> 40:15.113
* This will be

40:15.146 --> 40:17.048
-* An everlasting love
-You made it!

40:17.082 --> 40:19.117
-* This will be...
-Hey. Hi.

40:19.150 --> 40:21.787
Uh... wh....
you change your hair?

40:21.820 --> 40:24.122
Yeah. Well, after the earthquake

40:24.155 --> 40:26.458
and almost dying twice--
it makes you

40:26.492 --> 40:28.393
reevaluate a few things.

40:28.426 --> 40:30.762
So, back to my roots.
(laughs)

40:30.796 --> 40:32.798
-That looks great.
-Thanks.

40:32.831 --> 40:35.100
I-I wasn't sure
if you were gonna show.

40:35.133 --> 40:38.169
You seemed a little hesitant
on the phone.

40:38.203 --> 40:40.405
Yeah. Um...

40:40.438 --> 40:42.674
Buck 1.0...

40:42.708 --> 40:44.810
wouldn't have
thought twice about it.

40:44.843 --> 40:48.313
Buck 2.0 has to ask:

40:48.346 --> 40:50.348
you... you didn't call me
'cause you felt

40:50.381 --> 40:51.917
some kind of weird debt, right?

40:51.950 --> 40:54.085
Me-me saving your life and all.

40:54.119 --> 40:56.788
Oh, is that the way
you remember it?

40:56.822 --> 41:00.291
'Cause I-I seem to remember
Eddie catching me as I

41:00.325 --> 41:02.994
-was falling out the window.
-(chuckles) Um,
I-I told him to do that.

41:03.028 --> 41:05.196
Wow, maybe
I should have called him.

41:05.230 --> 41:06.464
(both laugh)

41:06.498 --> 41:08.500
Well, I'm-I'm glad you didn't.

41:08.534 --> 41:09.668
Come on.

41:09.701 --> 41:12.237
I, um, I already got us a table.

41:13.539 --> 41:14.806
So, hey, is there a reason

41:14.840 --> 41:16.207
why you're referring to yourself

41:16.241 --> 41:18.309
as Buck 1 and 2.0?

41:18.343 --> 41:19.878
It's-it's a long story.

41:19.911 --> 41:21.813
MADDIE:
Romeo and Juliet.

41:21.847 --> 41:23.682
Antony and Cleopatra.

41:23.715 --> 41:25.383
Lancelot and Guinevere.

41:25.416 --> 41:28.486
Great love stories
that started with a bang

41:28.520 --> 41:31.122
and ended in tragedy.

41:31.156 --> 41:33.158
*

41:33.191 --> 41:36.995
In the real world,
no one's life is that linear.

41:37.028 --> 41:40.465
We fall in and out of love.

41:40.498 --> 41:43.501
* You gave me more joy
than I ever dreamed of *

41:43.535 --> 41:44.870
* And no one...

41:44.903 --> 41:47.305
We take it for granted.

41:47.338 --> 41:50.375
Or find it
where we least expect it.

41:50.408 --> 41:53.044
* You and me, yes, sirree

41:53.078 --> 41:56.381
Some relationships
can seem easy from the start...

41:56.414 --> 41:58.584
* And kissing and pleasing,
together forever *

41:58.617 --> 42:01.252
-* Through rain or whatever
- ...and others can be faced

42:01.286 --> 42:02.988
with tremendous obstacles.

42:03.021 --> 42:05.223
* So long as I'm living,
true love I'll be giving *

42:05.256 --> 42:08.393
* To you I'll be serving, 'cause
you're so deserving, hey *

42:08.426 --> 42:09.728
* You're so deserving... *

42:09.761 --> 42:11.930
We root for love
to conquer all,

42:11.963 --> 42:14.499
but we also root
for a comeback.

42:14.532 --> 42:16.001
* Oh, love

42:16.034 --> 42:18.403
People who have been
knocked down by life

42:18.436 --> 42:21.106
and get back up on their feet.

42:21.139 --> 42:24.075
Who learn from the mistakes
that they've made

42:24.109 --> 42:28.446
and grow into better,
more complete human beings.

42:28.479 --> 42:29.681
* Love, love

42:29.715 --> 42:31.049
* From now on

42:31.082 --> 42:33.184
So maybe
the greatest love stories

42:33.218 --> 42:36.454
aren't the ones
that end in tragedies.

42:36.487 --> 42:40.759
Maybe they're the ones that
start with a second chance.

42:40.792 --> 42:42.594
* From now on

42:42.628 --> 42:44.763
* From now on, yeah

42:44.796 --> 42:45.931
* From now on

42:45.964 --> 42:48.233
* From now on, from now on.

42:59.577 --> 43:02.914
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

43:29.274 --> 43:31.576
You've answered the call
on 9-1-1.

43:31.609 --> 43:33.845
Now here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

43:36.481 --> 43:37.683
Buckle up, buttercup.

43:40.018 --> 43:42.353
It's real, and it pulls
people together.

43:42.387 --> 43:45.957

43:45.991 --> 43:49.527
* We live for glory
not forever *

43:49.560 --> 43:50.595
MAN: Touchdown!

43:50.628 --> 43:54.165
* Reach out *

43:54.199 --> 43:57.803
* Make this right here
right now *

43:57.836 --> 44:00.739
* Stand up *

44:01.639 --> 44:03.374
* Here right now *

44:03.408 --> 44:05.376
That sounds like fun.
