NARRATOR:
<i>Previously on</i> Hill Street Blues...

00:03.336 --> 00:06.798
Take a deep breath.
Take it easy, take it easy.

00:07.465 --> 00:09.467
Don't do it, Bobby. She's dead.

00:09.551 --> 00:10.969
It's a match with the bullet
that killed Nichols,

00:11.052 --> 00:12.762
but different from the ones
that killed the others.

00:12.846 --> 00:15.473
same caliber, same kind of rifle,
different ballistics.

00:15.557 --> 00:16.391
Copycat.

00:16.474 --> 00:18.018
Hey, why don't you get
some parking lessons, chump?

00:18.101 --> 00:19.602
You gonna give them to me, man?

00:21.354 --> 00:22.313
(explosion)

00:22.397 --> 00:24.274
RAY: Here, this is the one.

00:24.357 --> 00:26.234
-Nolan.
-And Marino.

00:26.317 --> 00:28.278
-What did he tell you?
-Take down the cop.

00:28.361 --> 00:30.196
-Which cop?
-Just, uh...

00:30.280 --> 00:33.241
J.D. said Marty wasn't killed
by the sniper.

00:33.324 --> 00:35.785
It was some kind of hit.
Something with Marino.

00:35.869 --> 00:38.705
I was supposed to have lunch
with Henry today, but he can't.

00:38.788 --> 00:40.040
Would you want to have lunch with me?

00:40.123 --> 00:43.418
I don't have time for lunch.
I don't have time for a hen party.

00:43.501 --> 00:45.962
NARRATOR:
<i>And now, tonight on</i> Hill Street Blues...

00:46.046 --> 00:48.339
Tell me to do it, Annie.
Let me do it to both of us.

00:48.423 --> 00:50.050
Tom, drop the weapon.

00:50.425 --> 00:51.551
-You get away.
-(woman screaming)

00:51.634 --> 00:54.304
I used to have a nice life
and you screwed it all up.

00:54.387 --> 00:57.474
My life, my job,
you screwed up everything.

00:59.184 --> 01:00.769
- [indistinct]
- Piece on the table, Marino.

01:00.852 --> 01:02.729
Hey, what's going on here?

01:02.812 --> 01:03.897
-How bad is this?
-Bad.

01:03.980 --> 01:05.774
-Come on.
-Hey, that's it.

01:05.857 --> 01:08.693
That's it.
Hey, the carving event is over. Drop it.

01:08.777 --> 01:10.862
Officer Nichols, why was she killed?

01:10.945 --> 01:13.656
She was an ambitious chick.
I mean, she got greedy.

01:13.740 --> 01:15.492
-Lieutenant, what is going on?
-The sniper called.

01:15.575 --> 01:16.785
He says he wants to turn himself in.

01:16.868 --> 01:18.036
-Here?
-No, no, the diner.

01:18.119 --> 01:20.163
What's happening, Lieutenant?

01:20.246 --> 01:21.915
Pulling up stakes, Freddie.

01:21.998 --> 01:23.792
-Thanks for the cooperation.
-You're going?

01:24.209 --> 01:26.002
This is Wolf Leader to all units.

01:28.963 --> 01:31.132
Police! Hold it!

01:33.343 --> 01:35.386
(people chattering)

01:37.347 --> 01:38.890
-Item eight.
-RENKO: Item nine.

01:38.973 --> 01:39.808
(chuckling)

01:39.891 --> 01:41.476
When's the sergeant coming back?

01:42.769 --> 01:44.104
He comes home from the hospital today.

01:44.187 --> 01:45.230
Says he'll be in tomorrow morning.

01:45.313 --> 01:47.148
-Thank you very much.
-All right.

01:47.232 --> 01:48.066
HENRY: Item nine.

01:48.149 --> 01:49.859
We're trying to move
on the bingo robberies.

01:49.943 --> 01:51.194
Mick Belker's undercover today

01:51.277 --> 01:53.738
as Beth El Temple on Horn and Sycamore.

01:53.822 --> 01:57.408
Mick, we're gonna use area backup
because of the sniper situation.

01:58.451 --> 02:01.579
Which is the rest of the items. Ten--

02:01.663 --> 02:03.957
Services for Marty Nichols

02:04.749 --> 02:07.794
are 3:00 this afternoon
at First Avenue Baptist.

02:07.877 --> 02:10.505
Her family is receiving at home
after the service.

02:11.047 --> 02:13.049
Address and directions
on the upstairs board.

02:13.133 --> 02:16.678
Mike Jaeger, Marty's partner,
continues to improve.

02:18.304 --> 02:21.391
We're sure Nichols and Jaeger
were shot by a copycat

02:21.474 --> 02:23.351
and the original sniper is still working.

02:23.476 --> 02:26.396
Someone who could be the guy
made three phone calls last night

02:26.479 --> 02:30.275
to Stu Casey,
that columnist for <i>The Tribune.</i>

02:30.358 --> 02:33.611
Phone trace gets it
to a six square block area.

02:34.028 --> 02:36.531
Van Horn, Dekker, 45th and Utica.

02:37.532 --> 02:38.700
Got it, Andy?

02:40.201 --> 02:44.205
Van Horn, Dekker, 45th and East Utica.

02:44.289 --> 02:45.456
Just Utica, right.

02:46.291 --> 02:48.418
That's the area
we'll concentrate our patrols.

02:49.127 --> 02:54.215
Last business is, greetings
the two transfers from Polk Avenue.

02:54.382 --> 02:58.845
Officers Archie Peyser Jr.
and Ann Schwitzer.

02:59.637 --> 03:01.389
Some of date ourselves remembering

03:01.472 --> 03:03.641
Ann did a rookie tour here
seven years ago.

03:03.725 --> 03:05.059
Still know the streets?

03:05.143 --> 03:06.603
I can find my way around.

03:07.937 --> 03:11.065
I put you in a unit with Archie today.
Sarge will make your permanent assignment.

03:11.149 --> 03:13.026
Welcome aboard. Welcome back.

03:13.109 --> 03:14.110
Okay, that's it.

03:16.988 --> 03:18.281
Uh, one more thing.

03:19.532 --> 03:20.366
Guys.

03:20.992 --> 03:21.993
Guys.

03:23.036 --> 03:25.288
An insane person is trying to shoot us.

03:26.164 --> 03:28.708
His MO puts him in a car,
but that could change.

03:29.709 --> 03:31.753
Watch the rooftops. Watch your backs.

03:31.836 --> 03:32.837
Be careful out there.

03:37.508 --> 03:39.135
-Lieutenant.
-Hi, Ann.

03:39.719 --> 03:41.137
That's just for today, am I right?

03:41.221 --> 03:42.680
Where I ride with Peyser?

03:44.057 --> 03:44.891
That a problem?

03:46.309 --> 03:47.185
It's just for today.

03:50.730 --> 03:52.106
You gonna go see Marty's family?

03:52.398 --> 03:55.860
I don't know what I'd say.
I want to find out what she was doing.

03:56.277 --> 04:00.198
-When's the IAD report come back?
-Captain said he was gonna let me know.

04:00.281 --> 04:02.951
Seven years. Is the place any different?

04:03.159 --> 04:04.118
Not so you'd notice.

04:04.202 --> 04:06.329
Hey, what was Goldblume like
as a young punk?

04:06.704 --> 04:07.789
He was shorter.

04:10.124 --> 04:11.501
-Annie.
-Yeah?

04:12.335 --> 04:13.920
Come here, Annie, would you?

04:15.838 --> 04:16.965
What are you doing here?

04:17.674 --> 04:18.549
I...

04:19.634 --> 04:21.719
Stay out of this. Stay out of this.

04:21.803 --> 04:24.180
Tom, I don't think it's a good idea
you coming here.

04:24.264 --> 04:28.434
You're full of good ideas for me, kid.
You've been a great thing for me.

04:29.435 --> 04:30.353
Annie, please!

04:32.230 --> 04:34.774
Let's, uh, go away.

04:35.275 --> 04:36.401
ANNIE: We can't, Tom.

04:36.484 --> 04:37.902
That is not gonna happen.

04:38.027 --> 04:40.780
Annie, let me take us both out of it.

04:43.116 --> 04:44.701
-Come on, Annie.
-What are you talking about?

04:44.784 --> 04:47.328
Please! We're better off dead.

04:48.246 --> 04:50.039
-Oh, my God.
-Man with a gun!

04:50.123 --> 04:51.833
Tom, drop the weapon.

04:51.916 --> 04:53.334
-You get away!
-(woman screams)

04:54.085 --> 04:55.253
You leave us alone!

04:55.962 --> 04:57.046
-Annie.
-Tom.

04:57.547 --> 04:58.423
(gunshot)

05:03.344 --> 05:05.430
(whimpering)

05:09.559 --> 05:12.020
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch, we have a 9-11.</i>

05:12.478 --> 05:14.147
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

05:14.230 --> 05:17.984
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

05:18.067 --> 05:19.736
(sirens wailing)

05:25.199 --> 05:29.120
(theme music playing)

06:45.822 --> 06:47.865
(people chattering)

07:02.380 --> 07:03.548
Are you all right, Frank?

07:04.132 --> 07:04.966
What do we know?

07:06.134 --> 07:07.885
It seems to have been a love triangle.

07:08.970 --> 07:10.179
Isn't the woman Ann Schwitzer?

07:10.638 --> 07:12.265
Yes, she was a rookie with us.

07:12.723 --> 07:15.268
She and Peyser were transferred here.
The young one.

07:15.351 --> 07:17.395
The three of them have been
at Polk Avenue.

07:17.687 --> 07:20.189
-Coordinate for IAD, will you please?
-Of course, Frank.

07:23.901 --> 07:25.570
-Peyser.
-Captain.

07:26.028 --> 07:26.863
My office.

07:34.495 --> 07:35.329
What went on here?

07:35.705 --> 07:37.957
I think that it was a responsible
discharge of my weapon, sir.

07:38.040 --> 07:41.210
I mean, what went on before
you brought your party to my precinct?

07:41.294 --> 07:42.920
This is a complicated situation, Captain.

07:43.004 --> 07:44.255
That's what I understand.

07:46.716 --> 07:48.509
Ann had been seeing Tom Hollister.

07:49.218 --> 07:50.511
And then she began seeing me.

07:51.596 --> 07:52.722
The bottom line is,

07:52.805 --> 07:54.807
she stopped dating both of us
two weeks ago.

07:55.975 --> 07:58.352
She didn't want any of this to happen.
Neither of us did.

07:58.436 --> 07:59.562
So you got transferred together?

07:59.645 --> 08:00.980
We tried not to,

08:01.564 --> 08:04.775
but we requested immediate transfer
so personnel put us here.

08:04.859 --> 08:07.945
You see, the Hill's the only precinct
that's understaffed.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.865
You gonna read me a lesson
in police demographics now?

08:11.449 --> 08:12.867
-No, sir.
-(knocking on door)

08:14.202 --> 08:16.537
-Captain. Officer Peyser?
-Yes, sir.

08:16.621 --> 08:18.122
Lieutenant Shipman, IAD.

08:18.206 --> 08:19.957
-I have to give you my statement?
-Yeah.

08:20.416 --> 08:21.667
Sounds like a hell of a mix up, Peyser.

08:23.127 --> 08:25.379
-Yes, sir.
-I mean downtown, too.

08:33.638 --> 08:34.472
Henry.

08:36.349 --> 08:39.477
What information did you have on Peyser
and Schwitzer prior to roll call?

08:39.560 --> 08:41.646
-Just the transfer material.
-Nothing in their jackets?

08:41.729 --> 08:43.814
-They're being forwarded.
-Damn it, Henry.

08:44.398 --> 08:46.651
You saying that's my fault
that the jackets are in transit?

08:48.194 --> 08:49.862
Guess I'm still feeling aftershocks
from the other night.

08:49.946 --> 08:52.240
-Where is it safe anymore?
-Not here today.

08:52.323 --> 08:54.242
I hope everyone's done
with target practice.

08:54.784 --> 08:56.160
-You ready to move?
-Yeah, on all of them.

08:56.244 --> 08:57.912
Pick up Fox and Goldblum at Midtown Vice.

08:57.995 --> 08:59.580
Take Marino at the Liars Breakfast.

08:59.664 --> 09:01.916
-Want to go in or wait till Marino--
-No, we go in.

09:02.542 --> 09:04.794
That's your end, Frank.
Whatever you think is best.

09:05.294 --> 09:06.128
Whew.

09:06.212 --> 09:08.256
Seventeen degrees outside,
I'm sweating like a pig.

09:09.549 --> 09:11.092
(sighs) I guess nervous is okay.

09:11.884 --> 09:14.262
I guess Eisenhower was nervous on D-Day,
wasn't he?

09:14.554 --> 09:15.471
Let's hit the beach.

09:17.848 --> 09:19.934
I never should have had anything
to do with him.

09:20.017 --> 09:21.686
I never should have gone near him.

09:21.769 --> 09:22.603
Peyser?

09:23.437 --> 09:24.272
(sniffles)

09:24.730 --> 09:27.733
A: he's a rookie assigned to me.

09:27.817 --> 09:29.527
I got a responsibility to train.

09:30.570 --> 09:34.699
But I swear, what's in my heart now
I felt the first I ever saw him.

09:35.199 --> 09:37.118
The first time he ever
walked into the precinct.

09:39.120 --> 09:43.874
So, A: I immediately should request
a different pairing eight months ago.

09:44.709 --> 09:46.669
Ann, you can't live out of some manual.

09:47.795 --> 09:51.048
And B: I was in the other relationship.
I was seeing Hollister.

09:51.591 --> 09:52.425
Were you living with him?

09:52.967 --> 09:54.010
Oh, no.

09:55.886 --> 09:57.305
He used to say
he couldn't live with himself.

09:57.388 --> 09:58.889
How was he going to live with me?

10:00.891 --> 10:05.062
Plus, he'd also say,
"You know why I like you?" (sniffles)

10:05.146 --> 10:07.648
"'Cause you're a sensible broad
and a beer drinker."

10:10.318 --> 10:13.946
So he watches me fall like a ton of bricks
for a kid 12 years younger.

10:14.572 --> 10:16.240
That's some sensible broad.

10:17.408 --> 10:19.660
You know,
Hollister just tried to croak you.

10:19.744 --> 10:23.414
I don't think he should be too high
on your sympathy list.

10:23.497 --> 10:25.499
I tried to end it with him.

10:26.250 --> 10:27.835
I tried to end it with both of them.

10:28.836 --> 10:32.214
These stupid SOBs in personnel,
they put us in the same precinct.

10:32.757 --> 10:34.258
So you put in for another transfer.

10:35.301 --> 10:36.135
Yeah.

10:36.761 --> 10:37.595
I got to.

10:38.763 --> 10:39.639
I got to.

10:41.307 --> 10:43.351
'Cause every time I look
at this kid's face...

10:44.435 --> 10:45.770
And I've worked too hard.

10:48.648 --> 10:51.484
But I look at him,
and I don't care about anything else.

10:52.568 --> 10:53.402
JOE: Hey, Luce.

10:54.362 --> 10:55.196
LUCY: In a minute.

10:56.364 --> 10:57.490
I'm fine. Go on.

10:58.282 --> 10:59.450
-You sure?
-Yeah.

10:59.992 --> 11:00.826
Okay.

11:03.454 --> 11:04.872
(clears throat) Thanks a lot.

11:06.207 --> 11:07.041
No problem.

11:08.167 --> 11:09.460
-I'll see you later.
-Yeah.

11:22.014 --> 11:25.601
Is this something?
Is this how terrible? That is a thief.

11:25.685 --> 11:27.853
-Where?
-Where? In the basement, that's where.

11:27.937 --> 11:29.313
Where they're calling the numbers.

11:29.397 --> 11:31.148
I won the diagonal bingo like this,

11:31.232 --> 11:33.484
and that pisher wouldn't give me
the silver toaster.

11:33.567 --> 11:35.861
I'm very sorry, ma'am. I can't help you.

11:36.821 --> 11:40.116
You shouldn't be too surprised,
but it's Bessie Testaman's nephew.

11:40.199 --> 11:42.576
The apple don't fall too far
from the tree, you know?

11:42.660 --> 11:45.162
I can't help you. You have to go away.

11:45.996 --> 11:48.040
-Can't help?
-That's correct.

11:48.249 --> 11:50.668
Am I correct that you're a policeman?

11:50.751 --> 11:53.003
-Shh, shh, shh.
-Kenton Markovich said-- Don't shush.

11:53.295 --> 11:56.090
You're a policeman,
so you have to enforce the law.

11:56.173 --> 12:00.428
It's game six for the toaster.
I won the diagonal bingo.

12:00.511 --> 12:02.972
Go away. Do you understand?

12:03.055 --> 12:04.849
Go away.

12:07.685 --> 12:09.145
Some cop.

12:13.232 --> 12:15.776
TONY: And it's my great pleasure
to report that Toby Canfield,

12:15.860 --> 12:17.445
last year's Holy Name scholarship

12:17.528 --> 12:21.615
averaged 12 minutes a game, 6.2 rebounds.

12:21.699 --> 12:24.577
(applause)

12:25.202 --> 12:27.830
God willing, maybe someday
he'll locate a jump shot.

12:27.913 --> 12:29.957
(laughing)

12:30.040 --> 12:32.626
Mr. Canfield and the other hoopsters
make their annual appearance

12:32.710 --> 12:35.713
at War Memorial Auditorium
two weeks from Saturday night.

12:35.796 --> 12:38.090
Hope you can make the game
to see your dollars at work.

12:38.174 --> 12:39.341
Thank you.

12:39.425 --> 12:40.968
(applause)

12:46.265 --> 12:47.683
-Good work, Tony.
-Thanks, Captain.

12:47.767 --> 12:49.977
MAN: There's no truth to the rumor
Tony took the chairmanship

12:50.060 --> 12:51.771
for the inside poop
if they'll cover the spread.

12:51.854 --> 12:53.314
(laughing)

12:53.773 --> 12:56.150
Tickets for the annual
St. Patrick's Day soiree

12:56.233 --> 12:58.068
start sales next Monday,

12:58.152 --> 13:00.112
Lt. Harrison's the man at the till.

13:00.613 --> 13:02.490
We've got the ballroom
of the Masonic Hall again

13:02.573 --> 13:04.742
which means they must have made
the repairs from last year.

13:05.701 --> 13:07.995
Who's that? Neal Washington?
You guys trying to integrate us?

13:09.079 --> 13:10.539
Call an unscheduled
committee meeting, Tony?

13:10.623 --> 13:11.624
Let's do this quietly.

13:11.707 --> 13:13.834
-J.D.: Piece on the table, huh?
-What the hell is going on here?

13:13.918 --> 13:15.252
-How bad is this?
-Bad.

13:15.336 --> 13:16.879
Um, let us in on the joke, fellas.

13:18.088 --> 13:19.340
Must be the parking tickets.

13:19.423 --> 13:20.257
Let's go, Tony.

13:29.183 --> 13:30.100
JOE: Is it on yet?

13:30.601 --> 13:31.602
No.

13:32.645 --> 13:34.480
JOE: Do you have this switch turned on?

13:34.605 --> 13:37.817
Yeah, Einstein, I do.
Why don't you check the socket?

13:43.155 --> 13:44.114
-WOMAN: Hello.
-Hi.

13:46.075 --> 13:46.909
Can I help you?

13:46.992 --> 13:49.453
Uh, you were in the donut shop
where I work.

13:50.079 --> 13:53.040
You remember? I recognized you
from your picture in the paper.

13:53.707 --> 13:55.334
I was talking to your partner, Joe.

13:56.168 --> 13:57.002
Oh.

13:57.253 --> 13:58.254
JOE: What about now?

13:58.712 --> 14:00.589
It's on. There's somebody here to see you.

14:05.386 --> 14:06.762
-Hey, Sandy.
-Hi.

14:07.096 --> 14:07.930
How you doing?

14:08.389 --> 14:09.223
Fine.

14:11.767 --> 14:14.562
That plug had an extra prong in it
and it wouldn't fit in the extension cord

14:14.645 --> 14:15.771
so I had to smash it in.

14:16.313 --> 14:18.983
-Great.
-Great piece of safety legislation.

14:19.066 --> 14:21.318
The law requires polarized plugs
that don't fit

14:21.402 --> 14:22.862
in half the extension cords.

14:23.904 --> 14:24.947
No kidding.

14:26.031 --> 14:27.157
I'm in paralegal school.

14:27.616 --> 14:29.618
We just finished doing
some consumer stuff.

14:30.536 --> 14:31.412
Good.

14:33.247 --> 14:34.081
Great.

14:35.666 --> 14:39.253
So, Joey, I brought you
a couple apricot supremes

14:39.336 --> 14:42.590
and a couple of coffees
for the two of youse.

14:42.673 --> 14:44.550
Hey, that's really nice. Thank you.

14:45.301 --> 14:47.052
I felt bad we were out of your faves.

14:48.971 --> 14:51.223
Hey, Luce, I got to compensate her
for these, right?

14:51.307 --> 14:52.266
It's corruption?

14:52.349 --> 14:53.559
Oh, come on.

14:54.184 --> 14:58.355
No, I was thinking maybe
along the lines of lunch sometime.

14:58.439 --> 14:59.940
(car horn honking)

15:00.024 --> 15:02.151
Oh, not again.

15:02.234 --> 15:04.403
-(men arguing)
-Hey!

15:06.655 --> 15:09.074
You got the wrong idea
about my property, man.

15:09.158 --> 15:11.076
Move it! Move!

15:11.160 --> 15:13.495
(indistinct shouting)

15:13.579 --> 15:16.498
-Come on! Come on!
-Hey, that's it. That's it.

15:16.582 --> 15:18.417
Hey, the carving event is over. Drop it.

15:20.502 --> 15:22.463
[foreign language]
...urinated on my car, man.

15:22.546 --> 15:24.924
-You did that?
-I was trying to unfreeze the lock.

15:25.007 --> 15:28.010
(siren blaring)

15:28.093 --> 15:29.345
What's this, toot powder?

15:31.263 --> 15:32.848
Controlled substance, guys.

15:33.807 --> 15:35.142
What's this? What's that?

15:35.392 --> 15:37.394
-Huh? What's that?
-You got the right to remain silent.

15:37.478 --> 15:40.272
If you give up the right to remain silent,
anything you say can and will be used

15:40.356 --> 15:41.607
against you in a court of law.

15:41.690 --> 15:44.485
You have the right to speak
to an attorney...

15:44.568 --> 15:46.236
-You got a match, Luce?
-No.

15:46.737 --> 15:47.905
You got to urinate on it.

15:53.327 --> 15:55.621
That's because I already
softened it up for you.

16:09.343 --> 16:11.178
-You've conferred?
-Thank you.

16:12.346 --> 16:13.847
We allege 27 counts.

16:13.931 --> 16:15.182
Fourteen counts of corruption,

16:15.891 --> 16:17.810
seven counts making
and receiving of bribes,

16:17.893 --> 16:20.312
one count theft, one count of conspiracy

16:20.396 --> 16:22.314
to sell two count sale
of A-class narcotics--

16:22.398 --> 16:23.315
Twenty-seven.

16:24.233 --> 16:26.193
[Irwin] One count attempted murder
of a police officer

16:26.276 --> 16:27.695
while in performance of his duty.

16:27.778 --> 16:29.405
One count of murder of a police officer

16:29.488 --> 16:31.991
while in performance of her duty
which is a capital crime.

16:32.074 --> 16:33.867
Tony, should we talk again?

16:35.244 --> 16:36.370
(sighs) About what?

16:37.496 --> 16:39.248
Am I gonna open my veins?
I'm gonna take poison?

16:41.166 --> 16:44.253
You're busy men, right?
You're not curiosity seekers?

16:44.503 --> 16:45.629
You're here to do business.

16:48.674 --> 16:49.717
You want me to break down and cry?

16:50.718 --> 16:53.637
Everyone pretend I broke down and cried.

16:55.305 --> 16:56.140
What's your deal?

16:57.224 --> 17:01.145
He pleads to the capital crime,
he pleads to one charge of narcotics sale,

17:01.603 --> 17:03.689
and I'll give him immunity
on the murder of Ben Seltzer

17:03.772 --> 17:05.774
if he testifies against Fox and Goldblum.

17:07.109 --> 17:08.736
I want to hear the confession.

17:12.072 --> 17:13.991
(door opens, closes)

17:17.828 --> 17:20.164
What's the shot, Frank?
I need some information.

17:20.914 --> 17:22.750
Frank, my unit's been decimated.

17:23.208 --> 17:25.461
Do you know they busted Fox
and Goldblum at Midtown?

17:25.544 --> 17:28.047
-Yes, I know that, Jerry.
-Well, what the hell is going on?

17:28.130 --> 17:30.090
Look, I can't talk to you about this now.
Maybe later, all right?

17:30.174 --> 17:32.384
-Any news on the sniper, Ray?
-Nothing at all.

17:33.010 --> 17:34.303
Jose Alacan, Leo.

17:34.386 --> 17:36.346
-They got him in lineup.
-Thanks.

17:52.738 --> 17:53.781
I'm taking a day.

17:54.531 --> 17:56.325
Ann, we really need to talk.

17:56.700 --> 17:58.368
-No.
-Annie.

18:00.412 --> 18:01.747
You shouldn't be alone now.

18:03.707 --> 18:06.085
Are you gonna go back now and be with Tom?

18:07.669 --> 18:08.504
No.

18:10.214 --> 18:12.549
Please, can I call you tomorrow?

18:13.425 --> 18:15.427
No. I said no.

18:15.844 --> 18:17.262
Don't do this to me.

18:20.891 --> 18:21.725
Why?

18:22.976 --> 18:24.228
Because you're a kid.

18:25.395 --> 18:27.689
Because you show up with this goofy smile,

18:27.773 --> 18:30.484
and you're too good,
and I let you too far in.

18:30.859 --> 18:32.945
And you make me break all my own rules.

18:34.738 --> 18:36.115
Because I love you.

18:38.534 --> 18:40.828
You know, I used to have a nice life.

18:40.911 --> 18:43.580
It wasn't great,
it wasn't fireworks going off.

18:43.664 --> 18:45.916
But it was all right. It wasn't crazy.

18:46.166 --> 18:48.502
And you screwed it all up,
my life, my job.

18:48.877 --> 18:50.337
You screwed up everything.

18:55.384 --> 18:58.929
It's hard to believe you meet the criteria
for indigents, Mr. Alacan.

18:59.012 --> 19:00.764
Hey, speak English, will you?

19:01.598 --> 19:04.226
Judging by the car you drive,
I don't think you're broke.

19:05.227 --> 19:07.354
You don't think I got expenses?

19:07.437 --> 19:10.899
I got four women working.
Three of them are knocked up.

19:10.983 --> 19:12.317
Three out of four.

19:12.401 --> 19:13.694
-You know how that is?
-Mr. Alacan.

19:13.777 --> 19:18.365
One of them gets pregnant, and then it's,
"Oh, Maria's gonna have Jose's baby.

19:18.448 --> 19:20.117
-She's gonna get close to him."
-You're--

19:20.200 --> 19:21.743
And then they stop taking care
of themselves.

19:21.827 --> 19:24.163
You're not hearing me, Mr. Alacan!

19:24.246 --> 19:26.081
And then people wonder why you get high.

19:26.165 --> 19:28.375
I am saying that if you have money,

19:28.458 --> 19:30.669
you cannot receive
the services of this office.

19:30.752 --> 19:33.964
And I'm telling you that I got expenses!

19:34.047 --> 19:36.049
I got to get those bitches fixed!

19:46.059 --> 19:47.060
Yes, Chief.

19:48.478 --> 19:49.313
Thank you.

19:50.147 --> 19:51.815
Fuchs is here,
but I haven't talked to him.

19:52.858 --> 19:55.402
Yes, will do. Mm-hm.

19:58.363 --> 20:01.325
(sighs) Chief Daniels wants me
to walk into the bathroom,

20:01.408 --> 20:06.163
look myself in the brown eyeball
and give myself a hardy pat on the back.

20:07.122 --> 20:09.291
Man's some kind of motivational genius.

20:09.374 --> 20:12.419
Frank, you've got to wait
for another lawyer on this Jose Alacan.

20:12.502 --> 20:13.629
He's not indigent.

20:13.712 --> 20:16.173
I thought you people represented
right through arraignments, regardless--

20:16.256 --> 20:17.841
Not today, we don't.

20:18.508 --> 20:19.343
I see.

20:19.593 --> 20:21.762
Uh, well, uh,

20:22.638 --> 20:24.181
I'll see if I can
get a court-appointed, and--

20:24.264 --> 20:25.891
He just-- he started talking about

20:25.974 --> 20:28.435
getting his pregnant bitches fixed
and I couldn't...

20:31.813 --> 20:33.106
So I just walked out.

20:33.315 --> 20:34.816
It's okay. It's okay.

20:34.900 --> 20:38.111
-Uh, I'll have Leo make the call.
-No, no, I'll do it.

20:40.405 --> 20:42.032
I just thought I should warn you.

20:42.824 --> 20:45.160
Frank, can we go away
someplace this weekend?

20:45.244 --> 20:46.787
-I need it.
-I'd love it.

20:47.746 --> 20:49.414
I don't know how you stay so even.

20:49.498 --> 20:51.750
(laughs) Oh, ask Henry.

20:52.376 --> 20:55.337
About an hour ago, I was holding him
responsible for the Crimean War.

20:55.420 --> 20:56.838
(laughs) Oh, boy.

20:57.297 --> 20:58.215
I love you.

20:59.174 --> 21:00.259
I love you, Pizza Man.

21:00.717 --> 21:04.221
Uh, now if we can just get to the weekend
without my killing anybody else

21:04.304 --> 21:06.598
and you're not seeing any doctors,
maybe we'll be all right.

21:07.808 --> 21:09.518
Oh, congrats on Marino.

21:10.102 --> 21:11.353
You deserve some pats.

21:11.436 --> 21:13.730
-This weekend?
-If not sooner.

21:20.904 --> 21:21.738
Fay.

21:22.906 --> 21:23.949
Have you got a minute for me?

21:25.284 --> 21:26.118
I guess so.

21:29.746 --> 21:32.916
I think, uh, I owe you a...

21:35.752 --> 21:37.921
I owe you an apology
for my behavior yesterday.

21:38.255 --> 21:39.464
No, no, no, it's all right.

21:40.632 --> 21:42.384
I was just under so much pressure.

21:43.010 --> 21:44.386
I know the feeling, Joyce.

21:46.013 --> 21:47.472
I just couldn't talk to anyone.

21:49.308 --> 21:51.393
Least of all your husband's ex-wife.

21:54.855 --> 21:57.566
I think, uh, maybe most of all.

21:59.109 --> 22:00.610
Fay, it wasn't just the shooting.

22:02.112 --> 22:04.865
I had also just found out
I can't have children.

22:05.657 --> 22:07.826
I'm so sorry for both of you.

22:08.118 --> 22:08.952
Thank you.

22:09.953 --> 22:12.622
Anyway, it wasn't a great a day
all the way around.

22:13.957 --> 22:15.542
And when you asked me out for lunch,

22:17.044 --> 22:18.795
I was suddenly so angry with you.

22:20.839 --> 22:22.090
Because I have children?

22:22.591 --> 22:23.842
Because you have his child.

22:28.180 --> 22:29.056
Joyce...

22:30.891 --> 22:33.518
Frank Jr. has always had
a tremendous crush on you.

22:34.686 --> 22:35.937
And I was very jealous.

22:38.815 --> 22:41.276
You're so beautiful. And so very special.

22:41.360 --> 22:43.487
And when he would go on
and on and on about you,

22:43.570 --> 22:45.781
I'd feel rejected and hurt.

22:47.616 --> 22:49.576
And then I said,
"Put yourself in her shoes."

22:51.078 --> 22:54.956
And what I saw was
that ditzy woman I'd become.

22:55.040 --> 22:56.541
(laughs)

22:56.625 --> 22:59.002
The ex-wife always coming around
bothering her husband

22:59.086 --> 23:00.420
never knowing when to give up.

23:02.547 --> 23:03.673
I swear to you, Joyce,

23:04.800 --> 23:06.218
I didn't want to be like that.

23:08.011 --> 23:09.930
I don't know, maybe I couldn't help it.

23:11.014 --> 23:13.725
The point is that when you got married,

23:14.476 --> 23:17.312
I decided I wasn't going to be a ditz
anymore, not for anything.

23:17.687 --> 23:18.563
And you're not.

23:20.565 --> 23:24.653
Anyhow, Frank Jr. really loves you.

23:25.278 --> 23:27.030
And I'm not threatened by that anymore.

23:28.156 --> 23:30.867
So maybe--
maybe you could be his mother, too.

23:31.868 --> 23:33.745
Not just his father's wife.

23:38.750 --> 23:39.584
Thank you, Fay.

23:46.007 --> 23:47.968
(shouting)

23:48.051 --> 23:50.262
(screams)

23:50.345 --> 23:52.431
You can't.

23:52.514 --> 23:54.182
Somebody-- Does anybody speak Spanish?

23:54.266 --> 23:56.893
(speaking Spanish)

24:01.022 --> 24:03.358
WOMAN: Okay. Okay, all right.

24:05.402 --> 24:07.070
Don't move him. Don't move him.

24:08.155 --> 24:09.865
Joe, go get some blankets inside.

24:09.948 --> 24:10.782
Okay, I got it.

24:10.907 --> 24:13.118
(siren blaring)

24:17.205 --> 24:19.666
(gunshots)

24:24.796 --> 24:27.048
Edgar and Storefront, shots fired.

24:29.593 --> 24:33.221
Officer down.
Request assistance. Officer down.

24:33.763 --> 24:34.598
Joe!

24:37.767 --> 24:39.436
I see it, I see it, I see it.

24:39.728 --> 24:41.563
-It's my arm, it's my--
-Don't move.

24:45.859 --> 24:47.819
Coffey's in surgery. Hit in the shoulder.

24:47.903 --> 24:49.154
Somebody get Bates' statement?

24:49.237 --> 24:51.114
She's still at the hospital.
They're bringing it in.

24:51.198 --> 24:52.908
There's partials on the car.
Nothing conclusive.

24:52.991 --> 24:55.160
-Door to doors?
-We're just finishing. There'll be more--

24:55.243 --> 24:57.162
I want somebody there
when Coffey comes out of surgery.

24:57.245 --> 24:58.330
He may have seen something Lucy didn't.

24:58.413 --> 25:00.373
-Frank, Marino's ready.
-What are we going to give him?

25:00.457 --> 25:02.751
No death penalty,
possible federal incarceration.

25:05.587 --> 25:06.630
Officer Nichols.

25:07.797 --> 25:09.424
-Yeah?
-Why was she killed?

25:11.760 --> 25:12.844
(sighs)

25:14.262 --> 25:15.096
She got greedy.

25:15.722 --> 25:16.890
She was an ambitious chick.

25:16.973 --> 25:18.141
I mean, she started out,

25:19.100 --> 25:21.061
I think she wanted to improve her career.

25:22.103 --> 25:23.813
But then when she saw how things were,

25:24.064 --> 25:27.317
I mean, where she saw no way
you're gonna stop any of this,

25:27.567 --> 25:29.528
that this drugs is a flood,

25:30.195 --> 25:32.781
and everyone gets rich
except the citizens.

25:33.657 --> 25:36.034
Believe it.
You're not gonna stop any of it.

25:36.117 --> 25:39.079
The best is you let them kill themselves
and you take their money.

25:39.579 --> 25:41.373
That's... that's all you can do.

25:41.456 --> 25:42.874
Officer Nichols.

25:42.958 --> 25:47.087
I, uh, believe we
arrested a guy, uh, Joey Bats.

25:47.170 --> 25:49.589
-Joseph Gambatista.
-Yeah.

25:49.673 --> 25:53.385
Which as a first arrest, a new officer,
you'd make available a little rhythm.

25:53.468 --> 25:56.388
Maybe 500 bucks to see
if she was interested.

25:57.389 --> 25:59.808
You'd leave the dough
on the subject's kitchen table

25:59.891 --> 26:02.227
or in his bathroom, and uh...

26:02.310 --> 26:05.855
The arresting officer questions,
"What's the disposition of this?"

26:06.022 --> 26:10.318
They're informed it's theirs.
And you find out they're interested.

26:11.111 --> 26:14.364
And, uh, she demonstrated an interest.

26:15.031 --> 26:16.908
Subsequently, uh...

26:18.034 --> 26:20.912
we, uh, became personally involved.

26:22.914 --> 26:24.249
I became involved with her.

26:25.917 --> 26:26.751
Imagine that.

26:27.752 --> 26:28.878
A Black chick.

26:28.962 --> 26:29.796
(chuckles)

26:31.256 --> 26:33.800
Which, as time went on,
she threatened me with a jackpot.

26:33.883 --> 26:35.635
She don't want to be kept, see?

26:36.386 --> 26:39.139
We're gonna be partners,
or she'll turn me in.

26:41.433 --> 26:42.517
So I had her whacked.

26:42.892 --> 26:43.977
(door opens)

26:47.856 --> 26:49.816
Jerry, this isn't appropriate.

26:50.650 --> 26:53.236
The hell it isn't.
He's my guy, I want to hear what he did.

26:53.320 --> 26:55.488
No, no, no. Let him stay, let him stay.

26:55.572 --> 26:58.992
This is the first time he ever
wanted to know how things are.

26:59.075 --> 27:01.328
You see, this guy is a joke.

27:01.411 --> 27:03.997
People were lined up
trying to get at his command.

27:04.664 --> 27:06.875
Meaning Division Vice?
The entire command was corrupt?

27:06.958 --> 27:09.544
No, not the whole division.
His direct command.

27:09.628 --> 27:14.591
The... Mizell, Sally,
Benedetto, me, Foxy, Donny.

27:14.841 --> 27:17.052
You got under Fuchs, man,
it was Disneyland.

27:17.135 --> 27:19.888
'Cause the guy-- the guy is such a mutt.

27:20.680 --> 27:22.557
His ant farm, see?

27:22.641 --> 27:24.893
That-- that's his big thing.

27:24.976 --> 27:29.481
I mean, right there in the office,
the guy is raising ants.

27:29.564 --> 27:31.191
-(laughs)
-Bastard!

27:31.566 --> 27:34.653
Oh, yeah, you're very brave
with five people in the room, aren't you?

27:35.070 --> 27:37.238
Oh, Captain. Captain, remember--

27:37.322 --> 27:39.908
Remember the last time
you went out with us?

27:39.991 --> 27:41.785
The last time
you actually tried to be a cop?

27:41.868 --> 27:44.746
What, that had to be--
that had to be four of five years ago.

27:45.789 --> 27:48.708
We're, uh-- we're staking out
this shooter's alley.

27:49.626 --> 27:51.002
Things get a little tight.

27:51.086 --> 27:52.754
It's looking like
we might have been set up.

27:52.837 --> 27:56.174
And the brave captain,
well, he's not taking it so well.

27:56.257 --> 27:58.760
I mean, he's shaking.
He's looking a little pasty.

27:59.344 --> 28:01.054
And all of a sudden...

28:01.137 --> 28:02.889
(laughs)

28:02.972 --> 28:05.517
The car doesn't smell so good anymore.

28:05.600 --> 28:07.185
(laughs)

28:09.771 --> 28:12.774
I mean, it happens. You know,
three-year-old's do it all the time.

28:14.651 --> 28:16.861
Since that night,
the captain isn't so interested

28:16.945 --> 28:18.613
in how things are going anymore.

28:21.491 --> 28:22.325
Excuse me.

28:32.085 --> 28:33.920
REPORTER: Mr. Mayor...

28:34.003 --> 28:35.505
Leo, Jerry Fuchs?

28:35.588 --> 28:38.466
He took off out the front door
like the building was on fire.

28:38.550 --> 28:40.844
REPORTER: Mayor Cleveland,
Midtown was your precinct.

28:40.927 --> 28:43.263
Do you care to speculate
on the possibility

28:43.346 --> 28:45.056
that there are more cops involved?

28:45.849 --> 28:48.393
At this point,
I can't say positively that there aren't.

28:49.060 --> 28:50.228
Now, if you'll excuse me.

28:52.439 --> 28:55.692
I would like to stress
that nothing in our investigation

28:55.775 --> 28:58.069
points toward any involvement
on the part of Mayor Cleveland.

28:58.153 --> 29:02.323
Chief, and will this scandal further
the demands for a civilian review board?

29:02.532 --> 29:04.784
-There's no E on that.
-Pardon?

29:05.285 --> 29:07.996
The guy arrested in Midtown is Goldblum.
No E.

29:09.581 --> 29:11.332
This is known as the big fish eat

29:11.416 --> 29:13.334
-what the little fish make.
-Yeah.

29:13.418 --> 29:14.711
-Mr. Casey
-Yeah?

29:14.794 --> 29:17.297
Mr. Casey, there is a phone call
being forwarded from your office.

29:17.380 --> 29:18.506
Oh, great. Excuse me.

29:18.590 --> 29:21.760
Chief, why don't you just give us
the names of all the officers involved?

29:21.843 --> 29:23.178
I think that would be premature.

29:23.261 --> 29:27.474
Suffice it to say, we have ferreted out
a large scale corruption

29:27.557 --> 29:30.351
which we will deal with swiftly
and appropriately.

29:31.060 --> 29:34.105
-Frank, I think we should--
-Frank. Irwin.

29:35.315 --> 29:37.233
I think congratulations
are to both of you.

29:38.026 --> 29:39.319
I'm talking about Marino.

29:40.278 --> 29:44.491
I'm sorry it came so suddenly, Oz,
but we were moving on this pretty quickly.

29:45.533 --> 29:48.161
I wouldn't normally condone secrecy
in this department,

29:48.244 --> 29:51.831
but in this instance, it looks like
your war room was the right idea.

29:56.795 --> 29:59.130
So much for keeping secrets from the king.

29:59.214 --> 30:03.259
Chief, can you comment on the speculated
involvement between Detective Marino

30:03.343 --> 30:05.386
and the female officer
that was killed yesterday?

30:05.470 --> 30:07.138
That investigation is ongoing,

30:07.222 --> 30:10.099
and there'll be no statement at this time
concerning that situation.

30:10.183 --> 30:12.685
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you for your time.

30:12.936 --> 30:14.687
REPORTER: Uh, Chief Daniels!

30:18.733 --> 30:19.818
-Hi.
-Hi.

30:19.901 --> 30:20.860
How's Joe Coffey?

30:21.069 --> 30:22.403
Convinced he's not gonna make it
through the night

30:22.487 --> 30:25.323
without his trashy magazines
and junk food.

30:25.406 --> 30:28.034
-But he's gonna be okay, right?
-Yeah, he's gonna be fine.

30:28.117 --> 30:29.994
-Lieutenant, what is going on?
-The sniper called.

30:30.078 --> 30:31.871
-Says he wants to turn himself in.
-Here?

30:31.955 --> 30:33.081
No, no, no. The diner.

30:36.668 --> 30:37.502
Oh!

30:38.378 --> 30:39.379
Excuse me.

30:48.763 --> 30:51.307
-Good day to you.
-Yeah, same to you.

30:51.391 --> 30:53.518
Oh, you're Sephardic.

30:55.061 --> 30:55.895
Sure.

30:56.521 --> 30:58.356
Sometime a Jew?

31:00.066 --> 31:01.192
Excuse me, please.

31:02.652 --> 31:04.362
There they go! Stop them!

31:04.445 --> 31:05.989
-They robbed the game!
-Wait there.

31:07.615 --> 31:09.617
(Mick shouting)

31:16.833 --> 31:19.377
Police! Hold it!

31:21.254 --> 31:22.338
Stop, you...

31:24.048 --> 31:25.633
Is today some kind of Jewish holiday?

31:25.717 --> 31:27.886
-MAN: Not that I know of.
-Refill?

31:27.969 --> 31:28.803
No, no, thanks.

31:28.887 --> 31:31.139
My kidneys floated out
of here on the last cup.

31:31.890 --> 31:33.516
Hey, what's happening, fellas?

31:33.600 --> 31:36.269
-Man, this is making me crazy.
-Hey, be cool, babe.

31:36.352 --> 31:38.938
Nobody said homicidal maniacs
had to be punctual.

31:40.481 --> 31:43.902
Guy is probably out there somewhere
just laughing at us, Lieutenant.

31:43.985 --> 31:47.530
I'm inclined to think you're correct
in your assumption, Andrew.

31:48.239 --> 31:50.283
What do you say
we write this off to experience?

31:50.366 --> 31:51.242
Let's go home.

31:55.705 --> 31:57.498
Hey, what's happening, Lieutenant?

31:57.582 --> 31:59.292
Pulling up stakes, Freddie.

31:59.375 --> 32:01.085
-Thanks for the cooperation.
-You're going?

32:02.045 --> 32:04.923
This is Wolf Leader to all units.
You may proceed homeward.

32:05.006 --> 32:07.550
I repeat, you may proceed homeward, 10-4.

32:07.634 --> 32:10.011
Uh, maybe you ought to stay
a little while longer, Lieutenant.

32:10.386 --> 32:12.013
Extra coffee is on the house.

32:13.222 --> 32:15.308
I really want to see you get this guy.

32:16.059 --> 32:17.477
Oh! Oh, I'm sorry.

32:19.354 --> 32:22.357
It could be he wants to come,
but somebody's stopping him.

32:22.440 --> 32:24.067
He could turn up later.

32:25.401 --> 32:27.695
(chuckles) I don't think so, Freddie.

32:28.321 --> 32:30.365
-Here.
-Let me change that for you.

32:30.448 --> 32:32.700
-No, no, keep it.
-No, no, not me.

32:32.784 --> 32:34.327
You know, I'll change it.

32:36.412 --> 32:37.789
You know something, Lieutenant?

32:38.206 --> 32:39.832
-What's that?
-There was this, uh--

32:40.333 --> 32:43.628
there was this uniform in here yesterday
and he wanted some orange juice.

32:43.711 --> 32:46.297
And I said,
"Well, we make it fresh squeezed.

32:46.381 --> 32:48.299
So, it's gonna take a little time."

32:48.716 --> 32:51.177
Right away he starts yelling,
"Where's my juice?"

32:54.472 --> 32:58.309
Well, I told him I was-- I was real tired
and he was just gonna have to wait.

32:58.393 --> 33:00.520
And when I got it made,
he wouldn't pay me for it.

33:00.979 --> 33:04.482
Uh, he-he left it right on the counter
and walked out the door.

33:05.358 --> 33:06.985
Oh, some people are rude, Freddie.

33:07.402 --> 33:09.988
Yeah. I wanted to blow his brains out.

33:10.863 --> 33:11.990
I mean, I just wanted to...

33:13.866 --> 33:15.702
like, shoot him in the gut and...

33:17.495 --> 33:18.538
watch him die.

33:23.167 --> 33:24.419
Oh. See you later, buddy.

33:25.169 --> 33:27.922
Don't move, Lieutenant.
This will go right through you.

33:30.466 --> 33:32.385
See, you should have stayed.

33:33.386 --> 33:34.762
He was gonna come.

33:42.520 --> 33:45.565
You-you wouldn't want both of us to die,
would you, Freddie?

33:45.648 --> 33:47.734
Well, I need some sleep. (chuckles)

33:51.946 --> 33:54.782
I can't think no more. I'm so damn tired.

33:55.616 --> 33:58.703
Uh, well, you wanted to give yourself up,
you can do it now.

33:59.954 --> 34:01.164
Nobody's gonna hurt you.

34:01.247 --> 34:02.498
But he won't let me sleep.

34:04.208 --> 34:05.501
I don't want to kill people, but...

34:06.586 --> 34:08.337
He won't let me sleep.

34:08.796 --> 34:10.548
HOWARD: Who, Freddie? Who won't?

34:11.132 --> 34:13.092
He sneaks into my room at night.

34:14.385 --> 34:16.721
After they turn the lights off
over the hotel.

34:17.805 --> 34:20.183
I lock the door. I even--

34:21.392 --> 34:24.228
I even nailed boards
over the window, but...

34:25.688 --> 34:26.731
he keeps getting in.

34:28.483 --> 34:29.484
Who?

34:30.359 --> 34:31.194
The policeman.

34:36.741 --> 34:38.910
He's all bloody.

34:41.037 --> 34:42.830
And his hands are all burned.

34:43.790 --> 34:45.166
He won't let me sleep.

34:48.169 --> 34:49.545
Why won't he leave me alone?

34:51.422 --> 34:53.132
Do I got to kill all of you?

34:53.966 --> 34:56.177
HOWARD: We got him, Freddie.
He's in custody.

34:56.260 --> 34:57.261
He-he's under arrest.

34:57.720 --> 35:00.473
You're lying. No, no, he's one of you.

35:00.556 --> 35:02.225
No, no, he's a bad cop.

35:02.683 --> 35:04.560
Like the one that came in here yesterday.

35:04.936 --> 35:06.479
We've been trying to get him
for a long time.

35:07.021 --> 35:07.980
RENKO: Freddie.

35:08.856 --> 35:09.690
I got him.

35:10.775 --> 35:11.609
I arrested him.

35:12.693 --> 35:13.986
Put the handcuffs on him.

35:15.238 --> 35:16.614
His hands.

35:21.369 --> 35:22.995
You see his hands?

35:23.996 --> 35:24.997
We got him, Freddie.

35:25.832 --> 35:27.208
He can't hurt you anymore.

35:27.959 --> 35:28.960
You know, I...

35:30.628 --> 35:32.672
never wanted to shoot nobody.

35:33.047 --> 35:33.881
No.

35:34.757 --> 35:36.134
No, it's over, Freddie.

35:37.051 --> 35:38.177
You can put the gun down.

35:38.553 --> 35:39.762
You can get some rest now.

35:48.980 --> 35:49.981
[indistinct yelling]

35:50.064 --> 35:51.357
Back up against it! Against there!

35:51.440 --> 35:52.525
Let's get him down to the station.

35:53.442 --> 35:54.277
Come on!

35:54.360 --> 35:56.696
(whimpering)

36:01.033 --> 36:01.993
Go, Andy.

36:10.751 --> 36:13.421
(clamoring)

36:17.425 --> 36:20.303
What's the matter? Haven't you ever seen
a geek like this before?

36:20.970 --> 36:23.055
Get out of the way, fellas.
We got to book this creep.

36:23.764 --> 36:25.349
I wonder if I could ask you a favor.

36:26.058 --> 36:29.312
One of the cops arrested in
the Midtown Vice bust name is Goldblum.

36:29.896 --> 36:31.314
Oh, relative?

36:32.356 --> 36:33.482
No, it's a different spelling.

36:33.900 --> 36:36.319
You want it mentioned in the column
it's two different guys?

36:36.736 --> 36:39.071
Sure appreciate it. So would my folks.

36:39.780 --> 36:40.656
You got it.

36:47.246 --> 36:48.080
FRANK: Howard.

36:48.623 --> 36:50.958
-Frank.
-I just got the full story.

36:51.709 --> 36:54.503
I think you've added something
to the phrase "grace under pressure."

36:54.587 --> 36:57.131
Oh, it's nothing, Frank, really.

36:57.215 --> 36:58.674
Well, just the same, I'm gonna put you in

36:58.758 --> 37:00.468
for a commendation
when the report goes out tonight.

37:00.551 --> 37:02.136
-Thank you.
-Excuse me.

37:27.245 --> 37:28.412
Captain.

37:28.496 --> 37:31.666
I promised you a conversation
when IAD made its report on Marty Nichols.

37:35.002 --> 37:35.836
It's bad?

37:36.170 --> 37:38.714
There's no way to sugarcoat this, Bobby.
She was in it all the way.

37:38.798 --> 37:41.759
She started out taking payoffs.
Then she and Marino became...

37:43.427 --> 37:47.056
involved, and, uh,
she became his accomplice.

37:47.139 --> 37:48.933
What do you mean involved?

37:50.059 --> 37:51.269
-Personally?
-Yeah.

37:51.936 --> 37:53.521
-I don't believe that.
-Comes straight from Marino.

37:53.604 --> 37:55.106
Then he's lying! He's a damn liar!

37:55.189 --> 37:56.899
IAD did all the legwork, Bobby.

37:57.566 --> 38:01.737
They found money, a bank account.
Everything Marino said checks out.

38:02.863 --> 38:03.698
I'm sorry.

38:07.326 --> 38:09.787
How you doing, Captain?
So what's the deal?

38:12.832 --> 38:14.583
Nothing I can talk about. Maybe later.

38:14.667 --> 38:15.501
Okay.

38:19.505 --> 38:20.756
Hey, how's your girlfriend?

38:21.799 --> 38:22.633
(spits)

38:24.176 --> 38:25.136
Get him out of here.

38:40.443 --> 38:41.944
I could use my belt back.

38:43.070 --> 38:44.488
My pants are gonna fall down.

38:45.281 --> 38:51.162
That's too bad.

38:51.245 --> 38:52.621
What-what-what did he do?

38:53.247 --> 38:54.415
That's the cop killer.

38:55.166 --> 38:56.584
Something you got in common.

38:58.294 --> 38:59.378
He don't look like much.

39:00.171 --> 39:01.756
The similarities continue.

39:17.146 --> 39:18.272
(exhales)

39:23.819 --> 39:25.863
I could write a letter to my attorney.

39:27.031 --> 39:28.699
It's as good as a cashier's check.

39:30.409 --> 39:32.036
Ten thousand dollars.

39:33.788 --> 39:36.415
Just give me my belt
and go away for about ten minutes.

39:36.665 --> 39:38.626
No soap, Marino. You got nothing.

39:40.753 --> 39:42.838
MARINO: Maybe I'm just trying to do
the honorable thing.

39:43.172 --> 39:44.965
It's not gonna be that easy for you.

39:45.049 --> 39:46.759
Twenty thousand.

39:47.385 --> 39:48.302
I ain't for sale.

39:52.056 --> 39:52.890
Thirty.

39:53.808 --> 39:57.686
This is a different precinct, Marino.
You don't buy cops here.

40:10.991 --> 40:11.826
(sighs)

40:41.063 --> 40:42.565
(imitates gunshot)

41:01.083 --> 41:02.042
Hi, guys.

41:02.626 --> 41:03.627
LUCY: Hi, Sandy.

41:04.295 --> 41:05.337
JOE: Hey, how you doing?

41:05.671 --> 41:06.755
I'm okay.

41:07.381 --> 41:09.425
I'm not the one who was in a shootout.

41:10.509 --> 41:13.053
Some shootout. One lousy bullet.

41:14.305 --> 41:17.516
A little thing goes in my shoulder
and my whole body ends up hurting.

41:18.601 --> 41:19.685
Even my eyebrows.

41:20.019 --> 41:21.770
I guess there's a bright side, anyway.

41:22.480 --> 41:23.898
Oh, yeah? Explain it to me.

41:24.356 --> 41:28.068
Well, chances of getting shot
once in a career are pretty high.

41:28.360 --> 41:31.071
Chances of getting shot twice,
they're out of sight.

41:31.489 --> 41:34.658
Getting shot three times,
has to be in front of a firing squad.

41:34.742 --> 41:36.160
(laughs) Yeah, thanks.

41:36.952 --> 41:38.996
I'm out of here. I'll see you later.

41:39.079 --> 41:39.914
Okay.

41:42.791 --> 41:43.626
-Bye.
-Bye.

41:48.047 --> 41:50.132
Thought you might need
some taking care of.

41:51.175 --> 41:52.134
Yeah, maybe I do.

41:53.093 --> 41:54.428
Want to take my pulse?

42:12.821 --> 42:17.076
(woman on PA indistinct)

42:17.159 --> 42:17.993
Archie?

42:19.662 --> 42:20.496
Hi.

42:20.955 --> 42:21.914
Who are you seeing here?

42:21.997 --> 42:23.791
Uh, I'm here to see Hollister.

42:24.583 --> 42:25.543
The guy I shot.

42:26.335 --> 42:27.169
How is he?

42:28.546 --> 42:29.880
They said he'd be okay.

42:31.048 --> 42:32.258
He wouldn't see me, though.

42:33.133 --> 42:34.134
No one would.

42:35.344 --> 42:36.887
Annie doesn't want to see me at all.

42:38.013 --> 42:40.933
I understand that, I guess, you know?

42:43.561 --> 42:45.020
But not really.

42:45.104 --> 42:46.564
But if that's what she wants...

42:51.819 --> 42:52.820
Heck of a day.

42:53.195 --> 42:54.029
Yeah.

42:54.572 --> 42:56.991
I really don't think hanging around here
is gonna make it any better.

42:58.075 --> 43:00.119
Yeah, well, I was hoping
maybe she would come and..

43:01.745 --> 43:04.206
Archie, I think that now...

43:05.541 --> 43:07.084
Ann really has to be by herself.

43:10.379 --> 43:13.882
Are you hungry?
I mean, would you like to talk?

43:15.050 --> 43:17.595
Yeah. Yeah, to both of those.

43:17.678 --> 43:19.555
Okay. I'm buying.

43:19.888 --> 43:22.516
We'll get a hamburger.
I don't know, we'll get something.

43:22.600 --> 43:24.393
(music playing)

43:28.480 --> 43:29.315
Frank.

43:30.649 --> 43:31.483
Jerry.

43:33.027 --> 43:34.361
I was just calling you again.

43:35.904 --> 43:36.780
Thanks for coming.

43:37.823 --> 43:39.992
-Come here.
-Why don't we sit at a booth?

43:40.993 --> 43:44.288
What? For privacy?
(chuckles)

43:44.371 --> 43:46.874
I don't have too many secrets
left today, do I, Frank?

43:47.958 --> 43:49.251
I don't have too much hidden.

43:50.586 --> 43:51.420
Come on.

43:55.758 --> 43:57.843
-BARTENDER: Can I help you?
-Have a real drink, huh, Frank?

43:57.926 --> 43:58.761
Club soda.

44:01.096 --> 44:03.098
Nothing worse than
a reformed anything, right, Jimmy?

44:03.182 --> 44:04.475
That's what they say, Captain.

44:04.558 --> 44:05.684
Believe me, Jimmy,

44:06.644 --> 44:09.146
this guy used to really put it away.

44:09.396 --> 44:10.689
(laughs)

44:10.773 --> 44:12.608
Guy put us both under the table.

44:12.775 --> 44:13.776
New subject, Jerry.

44:14.526 --> 44:15.778
It's a good subject.

44:15.861 --> 44:17.655
We used to be buddies, didn't we?

44:19.448 --> 44:21.033
Started out in the same place.

44:22.951 --> 44:24.495
Used to close places together.

44:27.998 --> 44:30.125
They used to carry us out on our shields.

44:33.462 --> 44:35.923
Then you decided to get perfect,
didn't you, Frank?

44:36.006 --> 44:39.051
Perfect cop. Perfect wife.

44:39.885 --> 44:41.679
-Perfect little house.
-Shut up, Jerry.

44:48.060 --> 44:49.728
Frank, what the hell do I do?

44:50.020 --> 44:50.854
I'd quit.

44:55.401 --> 44:57.027
Yeah. Maybe I should.

44:58.904 --> 44:59.822
Maybe I should.

45:01.949 --> 45:05.577
Despite they didn't reveal
one instance I was corrupt.

45:05.661 --> 45:08.997
Not once instance, Frank.
In all the corruption around me.

45:11.667 --> 45:12.668
What? What is it?

45:12.751 --> 45:13.961
Your unit's a sewer.

45:14.044 --> 45:15.754
It was your responsibility,
and you didn't take it.

45:15.838 --> 45:16.839
You didn't do your job.

45:17.381 --> 45:19.133
Come on, Frank. Don't give me that.

45:22.219 --> 45:24.179
You're the only guy who stood beside me.

45:26.390 --> 45:28.267
The only guy who answered the calls.

45:37.067 --> 45:40.112
Come on, fall off the wagon.
Let's get blasted, come on.

45:40.195 --> 45:41.029
I got to get home.

45:42.197 --> 45:43.282
I got scared.

45:44.283 --> 45:46.618
I made it in my pants 'cause I got scared.

45:47.786 --> 45:50.080
And I think that's when I began
to lose interest.

45:50.289 --> 45:52.875
'Cause I hated-- I hated being afraid.

45:53.459 --> 45:56.044
That's what Marino's reference was,
to when I got afraid.

45:56.128 --> 45:57.921
Let go, Jer. Let go.

46:04.595 --> 46:06.138
No excuse, right, Frank?

46:09.600 --> 46:11.268
No excuse for signing off.

46:11.351 --> 46:12.186
None.

46:16.815 --> 46:17.649
You're right.

46:19.443 --> 46:20.569
You're always right.

46:22.196 --> 46:23.238
Okay, well...

46:23.447 --> 46:24.865
That's what I wanted, Frank. I--

46:25.532 --> 46:27.117
I just wanted to get your advice.

46:27.201 --> 46:28.035
Good night.

46:45.260 --> 46:46.094
Pathetic.

46:46.804 --> 46:47.638
Who?

46:48.555 --> 46:49.389
Jerry Fuchs.

46:50.015 --> 46:51.433
He's sitting over at Mahoney's plastered

46:51.517 --> 46:53.769
trying to figure out
whose fault the wreck was.

46:53.852 --> 46:55.562
I made the mistake of telling him.

46:58.857 --> 47:00.776
Is it true what I heard about...

47:01.777 --> 47:03.862
(chuckles) ...the ant farm?

47:04.571 --> 47:05.405
Yeah.

47:06.490 --> 47:09.535
If I bring one home, reserve a room for me
in the laughing academy, would you?

47:13.413 --> 47:14.248
How are you?

47:14.748 --> 47:15.582
Okay.

47:17.584 --> 47:20.462
I made a reservation for us
and Frank Jr. at the Shore.

47:20.546 --> 47:21.672
A family weekend.

47:22.047 --> 47:23.966
Oh, good, I'd like that.
It's okay with Fay?

47:24.633 --> 47:25.467
Yes.

47:26.552 --> 47:27.803
We had a long talk today.

47:28.637 --> 47:29.471
I saw.

47:30.764 --> 47:32.724
-She's a special woman.
-I know.

47:34.351 --> 47:35.185
What?

47:36.395 --> 47:37.688
I'm sorry, Counselor.

47:38.105 --> 47:39.731
-For what?
-About all of it.

47:40.899 --> 47:42.276
About being too much in my work.

47:43.569 --> 47:46.697
About not paying close enough attention
to what's really important.

47:47.698 --> 47:51.368
About maybe taking the marriage
too much for granted.

47:53.787 --> 47:56.039
As long as we don't lose
the romance, Frank.

47:58.083 --> 48:00.460
I don't want to let our marriage
kill our love affair.

48:01.962 --> 48:03.130
Tell me that won't happen.

48:06.758 --> 48:07.593
I'll show you.

48:17.936 --> 48:19.229
JOYCE: <i>Take off your clothes.</i>

48:19.438 --> 48:21.231
(both laugh)

48:23.150 --> 48:26.153
(closing theme playing)
