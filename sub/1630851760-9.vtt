01:07.442 --> 01:08.443
Ms. Dentist?

01:09.194 --> 01:10.904
Your clinic closed hours ago.

01:10.987 --> 01:12.989
You shouldn't be out so late--

02:10.630 --> 02:11.631
Excuse me.

02:12.549 --> 02:13.883
You dropped your phone.

02:16.803 --> 02:18.221
I'll leave it here.

02:20.765 --> 02:23.184
Continue what you were doing.

02:37.448 --> 02:38.825
It didn't break.

02:40.410 --> 02:41.286
Really?

02:41.369 --> 02:44.038
Our country sure makes sturdy phones.

02:44.122 --> 02:47.417
Of course. After all,
we are an IT powerhouse.

02:47.500 --> 02:48.835
-I should go.
-Okay.

03:01.514 --> 03:02.807
Get home safe.

03:03.600 --> 03:05.602
Okay. Thanks.

03:05.685 --> 03:06.811
No problem.

03:19.032 --> 03:20.742
You were just startled.

03:20.825 --> 03:23.036
That's all.

03:24.579 --> 03:25.705
Gosh, it's hot.

03:27.999 --> 03:29.250
Why am I feeling so hot?

04:00.490 --> 04:02.075
Is the feng shui bad here?

05:20.069 --> 05:22.280
Taekwondo!

06:04.947 --> 06:06.783
EPISODE 9

06:08.034 --> 06:12.413
<i>Please touch the anti-static pad
for your safety.</i>

06:12.497 --> 06:16.125
-<i>Please select your method of payment.</i>
-How will you pay? Credit? Cash?

06:16.209 --> 06:17.710
-Credit, please.
-Just press this.

06:17.794 --> 06:19.754
<i>Please select the fuel of your choice.</i>

06:19.837 --> 06:21.798
-It's diesel, so press this.
-Right.

06:21.881 --> 06:23.341
<i>You selected diesel.</i>

06:23.424 --> 06:25.384
-<i>Input the amount of fuel you want.</i>
-How much?

06:25.468 --> 06:28.888
-Fifty thousand won.
-Fifty thousand won. All right.

06:29.889 --> 06:32.934
<i>Please insert your credit card facing up.</i>

06:33.017 --> 06:35.103
-Insert your card.
-Right.

06:37.688 --> 06:40.108
<i>-Checking your fingerprint.</i>
-Press "confirm."

06:40.191 --> 06:41.567
It worked.

06:41.651 --> 06:43.027
You can refuel now.

06:43.111 --> 06:45.655
-Make sure you touch the anti-static pad.
-Right.

06:45.738 --> 06:46.948
Thank you, sir.

06:47.031 --> 06:49.784
Don't mention it. This is a problem.

06:49.867 --> 06:52.537
They're replacing everything
with computers now.

06:52.620 --> 06:55.873
The elderly have no time
to adjust to this change.

06:57.875 --> 06:58.876
Yes?

07:00.211 --> 07:01.212
Right now?

07:02.046 --> 07:03.923
Is it the standard size?

07:04.006 --> 07:05.383
Okay, I'll stop by.

07:05.466 --> 07:06.300
All right.

07:07.426 --> 07:08.928
Are you done?

07:09.011 --> 07:10.555
Yes, almost.

07:10.638 --> 07:12.723
We should've gone
to a regular gas station.

07:12.807 --> 07:17.270
By the way, didn't that guy
speak down to me?

07:17.353 --> 07:18.396
Did he?

07:19.730 --> 07:20.982
I think he did.

07:46.591 --> 07:49.552
Hello, Dr. Yoon.
Working out early in the morning?

07:49.635 --> 07:51.929
Yes. My body felt a bit heavy,
so I went for a run.

07:52.013 --> 07:55.516
I see. Are you sure
it wasn't your heart that was heavy?

07:55.600 --> 07:56.434
Sorry?

07:56.517 --> 07:58.603
I know.

07:59.520 --> 08:02.815
-Know what?
-Mr. Ban told me.

08:04.025 --> 08:08.112
He said you and Chief Hong
passionately embraced last night.

08:08.196 --> 08:09.030
What?

08:09.113 --> 08:11.199
Don't worry. I didn't tell anyone.

08:11.282 --> 08:12.742
That's not what happened.

08:12.825 --> 08:14.785
I understand.

08:14.869 --> 08:18.581
You spent the night with Chief Hong,
but you're also interested in Director Ji.

08:18.664 --> 08:21.626
You're torn between those two. I get it.

08:21.709 --> 08:23.127
You got it all wrong.

08:23.211 --> 08:24.962
Don't worry. I get it.

08:25.046 --> 08:26.964
I totally understand how you feel.

08:27.048 --> 08:29.634
Don't worry. I haven't told a single soul.

08:29.717 --> 08:31.052
I'm rooting for you.

08:32.053 --> 08:33.137
Good luck.

08:35.598 --> 08:39.268
Seriously? She's awfully excited
for someone with a secret.

08:39.352 --> 08:42.104
Don't you worry about a thing!
I won't tell anyone!

08:42.188 --> 08:43.439
-That hurts.
-Trust me!

08:44.440 --> 08:45.650
Gosh.

08:49.904 --> 08:50.738
Dad.

08:56.285 --> 09:00.206
Had you told me you were coming,
I would've cleaned up a bit.

09:00.289 --> 09:02.083
I didn't want to come.

09:02.166 --> 09:03.751
Unbelievable.

09:03.834 --> 09:05.211
He's lying.

09:05.294 --> 09:08.548
We were nearby, and he wanted to stop by.

09:08.631 --> 09:11.050
I told him
we should call you first, but he insisted.

09:11.133 --> 09:12.343
I see.

09:13.219 --> 09:14.387
Where's the bathroom?

09:14.470 --> 09:16.305
It's over there.

09:18.724 --> 09:19.725
-Have a seat.
-Okay.

09:20.977 --> 09:22.019
Goodness!

09:23.229 --> 09:24.313
Chief Hong.

09:24.814 --> 09:27.191
-"Chief Hong"?
-What? Yes.

09:27.817 --> 09:29.193
What are you doing here?

09:29.277 --> 09:31.487
I came to fix your shower.

09:31.571 --> 09:33.990
The showerhead burst,

09:34.073 --> 09:36.784
so I got completely drenched.

09:36.867 --> 09:38.244
The new head is stronger.

09:38.327 --> 09:40.246
Why would you do that in an empty house?

09:40.329 --> 09:41.622
Ms. Pyo just left.

09:41.706 --> 09:43.833
She told me to fix it
since you'd be home soon.

09:43.916 --> 09:45.167
I can't believe her.

09:46.002 --> 09:47.461
Okay, then. You should go.

09:48.671 --> 09:50.131
-Pay me.
-What?

09:50.631 --> 09:51.507
I need to get paid.

09:52.341 --> 09:53.884
Okay. I'll wire it.

09:53.968 --> 09:55.136
-Leave.
-Come on.

09:55.219 --> 09:56.929
Don't push me. My bag's still here.

09:57.013 --> 09:58.639
Fine. I'm leaving.

09:58.723 --> 10:00.016
-Gosh.
-Stop!

10:02.435 --> 10:03.728
Will you pay me instead?

10:03.811 --> 10:05.187
So you're Chief Hong?

10:05.271 --> 10:06.355
That's right.

10:07.857 --> 10:09.108
I'm her father.

10:09.817 --> 10:11.068
I thought so.

10:13.279 --> 10:15.114
Did you refuel your car all right?

10:15.615 --> 10:17.700
Yes, we did. Thank you.

10:17.783 --> 10:20.286
-It was my pleasure.
-You met him?

10:21.370 --> 10:23.623
Yes. I helped him out at the gas station.

10:24.707 --> 10:26.834
Do you frequent her house?

10:27.460 --> 10:30.963
Well… I do come by
more often than every now and then.

10:31.047 --> 10:33.507
Dad. Let me explain--

10:33.591 --> 10:35.635
What's your relationship with her?

10:37.219 --> 10:39.180
-What?
-From what I heard,

10:39.680 --> 10:42.099
you two even spent
the night together. Am I wrong?

10:42.183 --> 10:43.601
Well…

10:43.684 --> 10:47.438
-Dad. Let me--
-I'm afraid I can't answer that

10:47.521 --> 10:49.190
with a simple yes or no.

10:49.273 --> 10:51.942
I also heard you two
embraced each other last night.

10:52.026 --> 10:53.361
There's actually a good reason.

10:53.444 --> 10:55.363
Gosh, will you continue holding…

10:57.365 --> 11:00.785
Right. You have
no intention of letting go of it.

11:02.578 --> 11:04.622
Dad, I can explain. So please let go--

11:04.705 --> 11:06.582
There's no need. I already heard it all.

11:08.084 --> 11:12.088
Besides, I even caught him at your house,
so don't try to make excuses.

11:12.171 --> 11:14.715
-I said I'd explain--
-No, let me.

11:16.300 --> 11:19.387
You're right. I'm Ms. Dentist-- I mean,

11:20.638 --> 11:22.056
Hye-jin's boyfriend.

11:24.600 --> 11:25.434
Goodness.

11:29.021 --> 11:30.773
Oh, dear. Come on, honey.

11:54.380 --> 11:55.589
Why did you say that?

11:55.673 --> 11:56.841
I had to survive.

11:57.716 --> 11:58.717
What?

12:02.054 --> 12:03.764
That's your reason?

12:03.848 --> 12:06.058
Then what? He was about to crush my hand.

12:06.142 --> 12:08.978
And I figured
that this was the simplest way.

12:09.061 --> 12:11.522
He wasn't going to be convinced otherwise.

12:11.605 --> 12:13.441
Explaining myself wouldn't have worked,

12:13.524 --> 12:16.569
so I decided to just pretend
to be your boyfriend for today.

12:16.652 --> 12:17.736
And then?

12:17.820 --> 12:21.031
And then you can say we've broken up.

12:21.115 --> 12:22.658
What can he do about it?

12:24.869 --> 12:26.662
So you're making me clean up the mess.

12:26.745 --> 12:28.622
Consider this a part-time job for me.

12:29.206 --> 12:30.624
I'm your boyfriend for the day.

12:30.708 --> 12:32.376
And you want to get paid?

12:32.460 --> 12:34.503
I'll only charge you for the showerhead.

12:35.296 --> 12:36.338
Unbelievable.

12:36.422 --> 12:38.549
"Unbelievable"? Why? Do you not like it?

12:38.632 --> 12:40.217
Then I'll tell him the truth.

12:41.427 --> 12:42.887
Continue what you were doing.

12:44.680 --> 12:46.974
What is this? A rabbit?

12:47.057 --> 12:50.227
Yes. Isn't it pretty?
I have a fruit plating certificate.

12:50.311 --> 12:52.813
Hop, hop.

12:54.106 --> 12:57.651
Oh, my. You sliced them so well.
It's so pretty.

12:57.735 --> 13:00.029
It's nothing. Enjoy.

13:04.700 --> 13:07.495
Hye-jin, go to your room.

13:07.578 --> 13:08.537
No.

13:10.581 --> 13:13.375
All right, then.
You. Let's talk over there.

13:13.459 --> 13:14.376
No.

13:16.337 --> 13:19.590
-She says no.
-He's quite obedient to her.

13:19.673 --> 13:21.926
Women know what's best, right?

13:23.302 --> 13:26.388
He already knows the truth.
He's better than you.

13:26.472 --> 13:28.057
Be quiet, will you?

13:28.140 --> 13:29.975
Was that an order?

13:31.227 --> 13:33.646
No, it was a question.

13:35.940 --> 13:38.192
What's your name?

13:38.275 --> 13:39.401
I'm Hong Du-sik.

13:39.485 --> 13:41.237
-Sir.
-Age?

13:41.320 --> 13:42.154
Thirty-five.

13:43.197 --> 13:44.198
Sir.

13:44.823 --> 13:46.992
How long have you two been dating?

13:47.910 --> 13:50.037
For about three months.

13:51.539 --> 13:54.291
How could you have gotten
so close in such a short time?

13:55.251 --> 13:58.170
Honey. Calm down and breathe. Okay?

13:58.963 --> 14:01.173
Times have changed.

14:01.257 --> 14:02.716
Don't be so old-fashioned.

14:04.009 --> 14:04.969
Fine.

14:06.053 --> 14:08.055
What do you do for a living?

14:08.138 --> 14:10.307
I just have many part-time jobs.

14:10.391 --> 14:11.267
Are you saying

14:12.142 --> 14:14.687
you're unemployed?

14:14.770 --> 14:18.232
I'm currently experiencing
all the jobs in the world.

14:18.315 --> 14:20.943
But if you want to limit that
to having one specific job…

14:21.026 --> 14:22.319
Then no.

14:24.280 --> 14:27.908
Are you dating an unemployed man?

14:27.992 --> 14:29.535
I guess you could say that.

14:29.618 --> 14:31.036
Well…

14:33.122 --> 14:36.333
Why does it matter
when I make enough money?

14:37.042 --> 14:38.335
He's a good guy.

14:38.419 --> 14:39.420
What did you say?

14:40.212 --> 14:44.216
And he's not the incompetent man
you're making him out to be.

14:44.300 --> 14:47.136
I mean, he's handsome, tall,

14:47.219 --> 14:48.929
and graduated from SNU.

14:50.139 --> 14:51.807
-SNU?
-Yes.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.851
Besides, he got in
with the highest grades.

14:53.934 --> 14:55.227
Was it chemistry?

14:55.311 --> 14:56.937
-Engineering.
-Right.

14:58.147 --> 15:01.775
-I see.
-Anyway, he's just taking a rest

15:01.859 --> 15:03.360
in his hometown.

15:03.444 --> 15:04.403
Right?

15:05.154 --> 15:05.988
Is that true?

15:06.071 --> 15:10.826
Of course, Dad.
I am a good judge of character.

15:10.910 --> 15:14.830
She's right. I'm sure
she picked the right one.

15:14.914 --> 15:18.334
Let's go check out her dental clinic

15:18.417 --> 15:20.127
and look around the neighborhood.

15:20.210 --> 15:21.629
Sure, then.

15:21.712 --> 15:24.214
Then let's let him go first.

15:24.298 --> 15:26.175
-I'll guide you after.
-You should do it.

15:26.258 --> 15:28.302
Me? Sir?

15:28.385 --> 15:29.428
What? No?

15:33.390 --> 15:35.684
Let's go, honey. Come on.

15:39.521 --> 15:42.858
Are you insane?
People will see us together!

15:42.942 --> 15:45.402
Don't worry. I have a plan.

15:46.111 --> 15:46.946
Let's go.

15:50.908 --> 15:52.326
I can't believe this.

15:52.409 --> 15:53.619
Here.

15:54.411 --> 15:56.330
Eat slowly and enjoy.

15:56.413 --> 15:57.873
Eat up.

15:57.957 --> 16:00.209
-Thank you for the meal.
-My pleasure.

16:01.710 --> 16:05.881
<i>This is an announcement
to our dear Gongjin residents.</i>

16:07.758 --> 16:10.511
<i>-Due to some unavoidable situation,</i>
-No way!

16:10.594 --> 16:13.180
<i>-Chief Hong is pretending</i>
-Look at this.

16:13.263 --> 16:15.683
<i>to be Dr. Yoon's boyfriend.</i>

16:16.266 --> 16:21.105
<i>We ask for your cooperation
in this role-playing.</i>

16:21.188 --> 16:23.524
<i>Whoever contributes the most
will be rewarded</i>

16:23.607 --> 16:26.777
<i>a 30-percent discount
at our dental clinic.</i>

16:26.860 --> 16:28.529
-Thirty percent?
-Thirty percent?

16:30.531 --> 16:31.532
Let's go!

16:35.160 --> 16:36.078
Cut.

16:37.162 --> 16:39.039
You're in a food coma, aren't you?

16:39.123 --> 16:41.667
Yes. I'm extremely drowsy.

16:41.750 --> 16:44.128
How about we take a two-hour break?

16:44.211 --> 16:45.379
-Seriously?
-Yes.

16:45.462 --> 16:48.716
I don't want the staff
to get heat stroke in this scorching heat.

16:48.799 --> 16:51.510
We deserve to work in better conditions.

16:53.846 --> 16:56.223
-Awesome.
-But promise me you'll stay inside

16:56.306 --> 16:57.933
and rest up.

16:58.017 --> 16:59.226
-Okay.
-Okay.

16:59.309 --> 17:01.729
Let's take a break

17:01.812 --> 17:03.355
and come back by 2 p.m. Go.

17:03.439 --> 17:05.774
-Okay. Good work.
-Good work.

17:05.858 --> 17:07.401
-See you later.
-Bye.

17:07.484 --> 17:09.778
-Bye.
-Bye.

17:09.862 --> 17:11.071
-Hello.
-Hello.

17:12.406 --> 17:15.159
Goodness, you're going to spill it.

17:15.242 --> 17:16.869
No, I'm fine.

17:16.952 --> 17:18.328
That must be very heavy.

17:18.412 --> 17:20.998
Let me take it.

17:21.498 --> 17:24.126
-Goodness.
-It's nothing much.

17:24.209 --> 17:27.087
We just made some potato rice cakes.

17:27.171 --> 17:29.548
We've worked since early
in the morning to make them.

17:29.631 --> 17:31.383
How could you say that?

17:31.467 --> 17:33.761
My back is about to break in half.

17:33.844 --> 17:36.013
-Goodness.
-Are you not filming now?

17:36.096 --> 17:37.556
We're taking a break.

17:37.639 --> 17:38.724
-I see.
-I see.

17:38.807 --> 17:41.769
Thank you so much for this.
We'll have them later.

17:41.852 --> 17:44.188
Try some now.

17:44.271 --> 17:45.522
-Should I? Okay.
-Yes.

17:46.857 --> 17:47.691
My gosh.

17:48.275 --> 17:49.902
Check out this color.

17:50.444 --> 17:51.445
Here I go.

17:55.199 --> 17:56.241
It's scrumptious!

17:59.495 --> 18:01.288
It's so chewy.

18:01.371 --> 18:02.873
Are they beans inside?

18:02.956 --> 18:03.916
To be exact,

18:03.999 --> 18:06.794
-they're kidney beans.
-I see.

18:06.877 --> 18:08.921
I'm afraid they'll go bad quickly

18:09.004 --> 18:11.423
-in this scorching heat.
-I'll take them indoors.

18:11.507 --> 18:14.218
-Put them in front of the fan.
-Gosh. You fool.

18:14.301 --> 18:17.638
-They'll harden in the fridge.
-Wait.

18:18.222 --> 18:21.266
It's sweet and salty.
And the texture is just perfect.

18:21.350 --> 18:22.518
JUNE, try one.

18:23.435 --> 18:27.898
By the way, are you still on a diet?

18:27.981 --> 18:29.650
No, ma'am. Thank you for this.

18:29.733 --> 18:31.026
Try it.

18:33.695 --> 18:34.530
It's delicious.

18:35.405 --> 18:37.199
-Is it?
-It's so good.

18:37.282 --> 18:38.867
-Have more.
-It's so tasty.

18:39.451 --> 18:40.994
Eat more.

18:41.078 --> 18:42.746
Isn't the ocean beautiful?

18:42.830 --> 18:45.165
-Yes, I love it.
-That's right.

18:48.001 --> 18:50.671
Isn't the neighborhood cozy and nice?

18:50.754 --> 18:52.506
It's nothing special.

18:53.173 --> 18:56.343
Gosh. Hye-jin, why is your dad so boring?

18:56.426 --> 18:57.302
Sorry?

18:57.386 --> 18:59.721
It's impossible to have
a conversation with him

18:59.805 --> 19:01.974
since he's so indifferent
about everything.

19:02.057 --> 19:04.101
I have no idea what's on his mind.

19:04.184 --> 19:07.521
I know how tough it is to deal with people
like him. Does he sulk often?

19:07.604 --> 19:08.605
Of course, I don't.

19:08.689 --> 19:11.108
-He does. He sulks all day long.
-What?

19:11.191 --> 19:12.818
He sulks when his egg yolk breaks,

19:12.901 --> 19:15.487
-when we run out of toilet paper--
-That's not true.

19:15.571 --> 19:16.738
You have it rough.

19:17.489 --> 19:21.660
Then you must've frowned a lot,
but how come you don't have any wrinkles?

19:24.246 --> 19:26.915
Your boyfriend is humorous.

19:26.999 --> 19:28.458
What a lucky girl you are.

19:28.542 --> 19:30.627
-Don't worry.
-Don't go overboard.

19:30.711 --> 19:32.045
Go ahead.

19:32.129 --> 19:33.172
Hello.

19:34.756 --> 19:38.468
Gosh! It's Dr. Yoon and Chief Hong.

19:39.553 --> 19:43.265
No other couple can hold a candle
to them in the neighborhood.

19:43.348 --> 19:44.975
They're the best couple ever.

19:46.935 --> 19:48.270
I agree.

19:48.353 --> 19:53.025
My good friend Du-sik
looks as handsome as always.

19:53.108 --> 19:54.735
I thought you had a plan.

19:54.818 --> 19:57.112
-He can't act to save his life.
-You're so awkward.

19:59.031 --> 20:02.117
Hello, you must be Dr. Yoon's parents.

20:02.201 --> 20:04.244
-I'm Oh Yoon,
-What's up with his voice?

20:04.328 --> 20:07.289
the singer who sang
"Exercising in the Moonlight."

20:07.372 --> 20:09.917
Hello, it's nice to meet you.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.252
I guess you don't recognize me.

20:12.336 --> 20:13.545
That's fine.

20:14.129 --> 20:17.007
Chief Hong and I are pretty much brothers.

20:17.090 --> 20:21.511
And Dr. Yoon and I
often share thoughts on music and culture.

20:21.595 --> 20:24.473
-I see.
-I've prepared a present

20:24.556 --> 20:27.851
for you two. It's my autographed CD.

20:28.602 --> 20:30.020
-Don't!
-Here you go.

20:30.103 --> 20:32.814
And this is my poster.

20:35.734 --> 20:37.444
It may not seem like much right now,

20:37.527 --> 20:41.615
but it could be a remarkable gift
for your future generations.

20:41.698 --> 20:42.908
-Thank you.
-No problem.

20:42.991 --> 20:45.619
Hey, Du-sik.
Wow, have you been working out?

20:46.328 --> 20:47.579
-You're--
-Hello,

20:47.663 --> 20:49.831
sir and ma'am. I'm the zone chief here.

20:49.915 --> 20:51.375
Hello.

20:51.458 --> 20:53.502
Thanks to Dr. Yoon, we finally have

20:53.585 --> 20:56.046
a dental clinic
and can get our teeth treated.

20:56.129 --> 20:57.297
That's right.

20:57.381 --> 20:59.967
She's the owner of both my place

21:00.050 --> 21:01.385
and the clinic building.

21:01.468 --> 21:02.511
-Goodness.
-I see.

21:02.594 --> 21:06.265
I finally get to meet you.
Thank you for your help.

21:06.348 --> 21:08.642
Goodness. I should be
the one thanking you.

21:08.725 --> 21:12.271
You should bring them to our restaurant.
I'll prepare a nice lunch.

21:12.354 --> 21:15.107
No, bring them to my restaurant. I'll--

21:18.318 --> 21:19.903
Okay? Bring them to my place.

21:19.987 --> 21:20.988
Sure.

21:21.071 --> 21:22.781
-That way.
-Come by for some coffee.

21:22.864 --> 21:23.907
That way.

21:23.991 --> 21:25.867
-Goodbye.
-That's okay.

21:25.951 --> 21:27.953
See you, my friend.

21:28.036 --> 21:29.579
-Bye.
-Don't do that.

21:29.663 --> 21:31.540
This neighborhood is a bit odd.

21:32.040 --> 21:34.918
And how do they all know about me?

21:35.002 --> 21:36.878
Let's hurry.

21:36.962 --> 21:38.797
-Goodbye.
-This way.

21:38.880 --> 21:41.341
-Goodbye, Du-sik.
-Good luck!

21:41.425 --> 21:42.801
Goodness.

21:42.884 --> 21:44.761
-That was awkward.
-We did well.

21:44.845 --> 21:45.804
What's with the CD?

21:45.887 --> 21:47.806
-I was most natural.
-Why gave it to them?

21:47.889 --> 21:49.099
Because I'm a singer.

21:49.182 --> 21:51.143
-You were most awkward.
-That's not true.

21:51.226 --> 21:52.728
-I did well. What?
-Unbelievable.

21:57.232 --> 21:59.318
Are you crazy? Tell me you are.

21:59.401 --> 22:01.320
That's our precious cue sheet.

22:01.403 --> 22:03.905
I wanted to see
if it'd make a good paper plane.

22:03.989 --> 22:07.659
Are you kidding me?
Just go take a walk and get it together.

22:07.743 --> 22:09.411
-Fine.
-I ought to smack you.

22:09.494 --> 22:11.747
Gosh, you're so strong.

22:14.791 --> 22:15.792
What?

22:16.793 --> 22:17.627
Looking for JUNE?

22:17.711 --> 22:20.547
No. We Hackers respect our stars' privacy.

22:20.630 --> 22:22.632
Are you seriously not here to see DOS?

22:23.300 --> 22:25.510
Is JUNE in there?

22:26.178 --> 22:28.055
No, he's taking a rest somewhere else.

22:28.138 --> 22:32.017
Darn it. I should've come earlier.
Then I would've seen him leave.

22:32.100 --> 22:33.894
Darn it.

22:34.895 --> 22:36.563
-Hye-jin?
-There's a harbor.

22:36.646 --> 22:38.231
Why is she with Chief Hong?

22:38.315 --> 22:40.358
-There's a fish market too.
-You can't go.

22:40.442 --> 22:42.569
-Why not?
-Dr. Yoon's parents are here,

22:42.652 --> 22:44.821
so he's acting
as her boyfriend. Awesome, right?

22:44.905 --> 22:47.949
What? That can't be. Why?

22:48.617 --> 22:50.285
-I don't know.
-Hye-jin!

22:51.411 --> 22:54.956
Seong-hyeon. Aren't you supposed
to be filming?

22:55.040 --> 22:55.874
Do you know him?

22:57.250 --> 23:00.462
Hello! I'm Ji Seong-hyeon,

23:00.545 --> 23:02.631
Hye-jin's senior from college.

23:02.714 --> 23:04.966
I see. Hello.

23:05.050 --> 23:07.094
Your name sounds familiar.

23:08.053 --> 23:11.598
Goodness. Aren't you that famous director?

23:12.099 --> 23:13.391
Thank you for recognizing me.

23:13.475 --> 23:15.185
Wait. Do you know him?

23:15.268 --> 23:18.897
Of course. He directed
all my favorite shows.

23:18.980 --> 23:21.942
Really? It's nice to meet you.

23:22.484 --> 23:24.945
It's an honor to meet you, Father.

23:25.028 --> 23:26.196
"Father"?

23:27.364 --> 23:29.157
That's wonderful to hear.

23:29.241 --> 23:30.408
How formal.

23:30.492 --> 23:32.536
Aren't you busy? Shouldn't you be filming?

23:32.619 --> 23:35.539
-Filming?
-Sir, we're taking a break right now.

23:35.622 --> 23:38.250
Would you like to come in?
I'll give you a tour.

23:38.333 --> 23:39.709
No, there's no need.

23:39.793 --> 23:41.586
-That's okay.
-May we?

23:41.670 --> 23:43.296
Wouldn't we be a nuisance?

23:43.380 --> 23:45.465
Not at all. Come on in.

23:45.549 --> 23:47.092
-This way.
-Let's go.

23:47.175 --> 23:49.761
I'm actually their crew's guide.

23:49.845 --> 23:50.679
Seong-hyeon.

23:50.762 --> 23:53.849
-Yes?
-Let me explain.

23:53.932 --> 23:55.267
It's okay. I heard.

23:55.350 --> 23:57.811
Don't worry. I won't put you in a pickle.

23:58.895 --> 24:00.689
-Let's go.
-Okay.

24:03.483 --> 24:05.652
-This is the living room.
-I see.

24:05.735 --> 24:10.323
There's another camera here.
Gosh, how many cameras are there?

24:10.407 --> 24:15.078
I saw how these cameras followed
your movement.

24:15.162 --> 24:17.873
-Are they filming us?
-No, we turned them off.

24:17.956 --> 24:19.749
-Please sit down.
-Okay.

24:19.833 --> 24:21.918
Would you like some iced coffee?

24:22.002 --> 24:23.503
That'll be great.

24:23.587 --> 24:24.880
Coffee on an empty stomach?

24:25.797 --> 24:27.716
Then how about some tea?

24:27.799 --> 24:29.759
No, coffee is fine. Thank you.

24:30.760 --> 24:32.846
Why did you have to say that?

24:32.929 --> 24:35.307
Hye-jin, isn't you hot there? Come inside.

24:35.390 --> 24:37.184
No, it's okay. I'll stay here.

24:37.267 --> 24:40.103
Let her be. She works indoors all day.

24:40.187 --> 24:43.190
She needs some sunlight and vitamin D.

24:43.857 --> 24:45.483
I'm already taking supplements.

24:45.567 --> 24:47.652
Why, when you can get it naturally?

24:47.736 --> 24:49.279
Give your liver a break.

24:49.362 --> 24:50.488
Don't worry about me.

24:51.239 --> 24:54.659
-All right. Hye-jin, sit down.
-Gosh.

24:54.743 --> 24:57.662
Here you go.

24:58.872 --> 25:00.123
All right.

25:01.291 --> 25:02.125
Here.

25:02.209 --> 25:03.126
-Hye-jin.
-Thank you.

25:03.210 --> 25:04.419
Cover your legs with this.

25:05.921 --> 25:07.130
Thanks.

25:07.923 --> 25:10.967
I brought these from Seoul. Try some.

25:11.051 --> 25:14.387
Since they're vegan-friendly,
they're not sweet and easy to digest.

25:14.471 --> 25:18.308
Don't vegans refrain from eating meat?

25:18.391 --> 25:20.977
Bread doesn't have meat in it, does it?

25:21.061 --> 25:24.314
Well, you see, the bread--

25:24.397 --> 25:26.483
That's not what he meant.

25:26.566 --> 25:28.318
There are levels to vegetarianism.

25:28.902 --> 25:32.489
Flexitarians occasionally consume meat.

25:32.572 --> 25:34.574
Pescatarians consume fish but not meat.

25:34.658 --> 25:36.952
Vegans are the strictest

25:37.035 --> 25:40.163
and even refrain
from consuming milk or eggs.

25:40.247 --> 25:44.709
So simply put,
this bread doesn't contain milk or eggs.

25:44.793 --> 25:48.255
Please enjoy them.
They're light and tasty.

25:50.674 --> 25:54.344
Dad, let's leave
after eating this. He needs to work.

25:54.427 --> 25:57.055
Right. He must be busy.

25:57.138 --> 25:59.015
That's okay.

25:59.099 --> 26:02.060
She just doesn't want to inconvenience me.

26:02.143 --> 26:03.979
She's been like this ever since college.

26:04.062 --> 26:07.399
By the way,
we met through an elective course.

26:07.482 --> 26:08.900
I see.

26:08.984 --> 26:13.029
She prepared really thoroughly
for our group project

26:13.113 --> 26:14.531
and even did the presentation.

26:14.614 --> 26:18.618
She gave an outstanding presentation.

26:18.702 --> 26:20.620
-She left everyone was speechless.
-Really?

26:20.704 --> 26:23.999
-Did you know she's good at arguing?
-Yes, she's a feisty one.

26:29.087 --> 26:31.006
I was never like that.

26:31.089 --> 26:34.050
Please tell us
what kind of student she was in college.

26:34.134 --> 26:36.136
Let's see.

26:36.219 --> 26:39.931
She was studious
and worked hard for the scholarship.

26:40.724 --> 26:42.642
And she was a terrific dancer.

26:42.726 --> 26:44.352
She was?

26:44.436 --> 26:46.062
How could you tell them that?

26:46.146 --> 26:47.731
I only danced once.

26:48.857 --> 26:51.484
-That's enough.
-You were good at this.

26:53.903 --> 26:55.488
I won first place.

27:00.201 --> 27:04.581
Mother, please visit our TV station
next time. I'll give you a tour.

27:04.664 --> 27:06.374
-Do you mean it?
-Of course.

27:06.458 --> 27:09.085
We shouldn't bother you anymore.

27:09.169 --> 27:12.839
If you want, I can get you tickets
to <i>Gag Big League</i>.

27:12.922 --> 27:15.592
Really? I love that show.

27:19.804 --> 27:22.974
It's so strange
how nobody ever eats the last piece.

27:26.686 --> 27:28.063
-Oh, dear.
-Oh, no.

27:28.146 --> 27:29.981
-Are you okay?
-I'll bring some tissue.

27:30.065 --> 27:31.816
It's okay. I have some wet wipes.

27:31.900 --> 27:34.778
You should've been more careful.

27:35.528 --> 27:37.864
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

27:43.787 --> 27:44.871
Sir.

27:45.622 --> 27:47.624
Sir, we should get back to the shooting.

27:47.707 --> 27:49.959
Sure. I'll be there soon.

27:52.754 --> 27:53.755
Okay.

27:56.633 --> 27:59.511
I'm sorry we have
to make you leave like this.

27:59.594 --> 28:02.222
That's fine. Thank you for the tour.

28:02.305 --> 28:05.725
I'll tell my friends to watch your show.

28:05.809 --> 28:08.395
Thank you, ma'am. Have a safe trip.

28:08.478 --> 28:10.397
I'll officially introduce myself
next time.

28:10.480 --> 28:11.314
-Okay.
-Sure.

28:11.398 --> 28:13.525
-I'll call you later.
-Bye.

28:19.197 --> 28:21.866
I know you're just part-timing,
but treat them well.

28:21.950 --> 28:24.577
Of course. I'm going to be true to my role

28:24.661 --> 28:28.790
as Ms. Dentist's boyfriend today.

28:29.791 --> 28:34.796
That little… God, I never pegged him
as such an annoying type, but he's so…

28:37.132 --> 28:38.842
You surprised me too.

28:38.925 --> 28:41.219
I was wondering where our lucky charm was,

28:41.302 --> 28:42.262
and she has it.

28:44.055 --> 28:46.933
Director Ji, I bought a house
with a 30-year installment plan.

28:48.977 --> 28:51.813
And I need to feed my cats.

28:53.106 --> 28:54.107
Let's do well.

28:54.190 --> 28:55.191
Okay.

28:56.568 --> 28:58.403
-I'll do my best.
-No, do well.

29:00.405 --> 29:01.489
I'll do well.

29:11.708 --> 29:12.709
Ms. Pyo.

29:13.752 --> 29:14.711
Hey!

29:14.794 --> 29:16.087
What are you doing here?

29:16.171 --> 29:19.549
Me? I was just killing time here.

29:19.632 --> 29:22.677
Because I don't think
I should go home right now.

29:22.761 --> 29:24.471
What do you mean?

29:24.554 --> 29:28.183
It's nothing important.
Aren't you working? Where are you headed?

29:28.767 --> 29:30.643
I was just patrolling.

29:30.727 --> 29:33.480
Now, I'm delivering lunch
to the elderly living alone.

29:33.563 --> 29:36.149
Me. I'll help you. Let me volunteer.

29:36.232 --> 29:38.610
What? There's no need for that.

29:38.693 --> 29:42.322
It's okay.
I have nothing better to do anyway.

29:42.405 --> 29:46.034
This is wonderful.
I'm helping those in need.

29:46.117 --> 29:47.327
Can I get in?

29:49.162 --> 29:50.538
What are these?

29:50.622 --> 29:51.748
They're lunch boxes.

29:52.457 --> 29:53.291
I see.

29:54.793 --> 29:58.463
This is my first time riding a police car.

29:59.130 --> 30:02.008
The seat feels different.

30:02.091 --> 30:04.260
It's coated with enamel
to make it waterproof.

30:04.344 --> 30:06.596
Because drunk citizens often throw up

30:06.679 --> 30:08.431
or relieve themselves in the car.

30:09.098 --> 30:10.099
They do what?

30:10.183 --> 30:14.062
Don't worry. There was an incident
last night, but I cleaned up after them.

30:15.605 --> 30:17.816
I see.

30:21.653 --> 30:23.655
-Give me a minute.
-What?

30:39.671 --> 30:42.549
License plate 8736,
you made an illegal U-turn.

30:42.632 --> 30:43.758
Please pull over.

30:48.555 --> 30:50.098
-Wait here.
-Okay.

30:56.938 --> 30:59.315
He looks even more handsome when working.

30:59.399 --> 31:00.316
Thank you.

31:01.818 --> 31:03.695
He's driving me crazy.

31:05.530 --> 31:07.407
-Sorry about that.
-No, it's fine.

31:07.991 --> 31:10.451
Did you just give him a ticket?

31:10.535 --> 31:14.038
He went over the centerline. That's
30 penalty points and a 60,000-won fine.

31:14.122 --> 31:14.956
I see.

31:15.957 --> 31:18.001
You should be penalized too.

31:18.960 --> 31:19.794
Sorry?

31:20.879 --> 31:23.298
You see, you invaded my heart.

31:24.173 --> 31:27.969
As for the penalty, let's call it even
with the chicken you bought.

31:33.057 --> 31:34.392
Let's date.

31:39.689 --> 31:41.733
I think you're being rash.

31:44.027 --> 31:44.861
Sorry?

31:46.905 --> 31:50.450
You still don't know much about me.

31:52.535 --> 31:55.872
I understand that people these days
easily fall for each other

31:55.955 --> 31:57.332
and date casually.

31:57.957 --> 32:01.669
I'm aware of how easy it is
for people to start dating.

32:02.378 --> 32:04.464
However, I'm afraid
I'm a bit old-fashioned.

32:08.301 --> 32:10.219
I hope you understand.

32:10.303 --> 32:11.638
Sure.

32:13.681 --> 32:16.893
Wait. I just remembered

32:16.976 --> 32:20.772
that I have somewhere to be right now.

32:20.855 --> 32:25.068
I promise I'll help you
deliver the lunch boxes next time.

32:30.114 --> 32:31.866
This is driving me insane.

32:33.743 --> 32:36.287
Rear doors of police cars
don't open from the inside.

32:36.371 --> 32:39.540
I see. Darn it.

32:40.875 --> 32:43.586
Okay. Thank you.

33:06.818 --> 33:11.114
Hye-jin, does Seong-hyeon
have a girlfriend?

33:11.197 --> 33:14.450
Seong-hyeon? Probably not.

33:14.534 --> 33:19.789
Really? He seemed like a decent guy.

33:19.872 --> 33:21.624
-I see.
-Over here.

33:21.708 --> 33:23.376
It's nice and cozy.

33:23.459 --> 33:26.170
It's neither too big nor too small.

33:26.254 --> 33:27.088
-Right?
-Really?

33:27.171 --> 33:30.466
I chose this place
and took care of the renovation myself.

33:30.550 --> 33:31.759
What a show-off.

33:31.843 --> 33:34.220
What? Did you say something?

33:34.303 --> 33:37.765
Hye-jin, take good care of the orchids.

33:37.849 --> 33:38.933
I will.

33:39.017 --> 33:43.146
You're one to talk.
You've let a few die yourself.

33:43.229 --> 33:45.023
What kind of orchids did you have?

33:45.106 --> 33:47.233
Oriental orchids. You wouldn't know.

33:47.316 --> 33:49.318
Those are noble orchids.

33:49.402 --> 33:53.614
To make them bloom, you need to maintain
the temperature well during winter.

33:53.698 --> 33:55.324
How did you do it?

33:55.408 --> 33:58.369
What do you take me for?
I kept them in our living room.

33:58.453 --> 34:01.998
Oh, dear. The temperature
must've been too high.

34:02.081 --> 34:06.335
During winter, they should stay
at temperatures between 5°C or 15°C

34:06.419 --> 34:10.631
for 60 consecutive days to bloom.

34:10.715 --> 34:13.468
Is that so? I thought they'd freeze.

34:13.551 --> 34:14.802
I see.

34:14.886 --> 34:19.098
By the way, how do you know
so much about growing orchids?

34:19.182 --> 34:21.017
That was my job in the military.

34:21.517 --> 34:22.852
Sir.

34:22.935 --> 34:24.103
Is that actually a thing?

34:24.187 --> 34:28.316
Yes. I grew trees and flowers
that were used for events.

34:28.399 --> 34:29.525
I see.

34:31.444 --> 34:32.445
Look.

34:35.531 --> 34:38.910
I'm also growing Jeju Island boat orchids.

34:38.993 --> 34:40.495
Boat orchids… Let me think.

34:44.207 --> 34:47.335
Boat orchids live in shaded forests.

34:47.418 --> 34:51.047
The environment needs to be warm.
And give them enough water and fertilizer.

34:51.547 --> 34:54.759
-They shouldn't receive too much sunlight.
-I see.

34:54.842 --> 34:56.719
-Hello.
-Hello.

34:56.803 --> 34:58.221
Do you want to go upstairs?

34:58.304 --> 35:00.223
Sure. It has the best view.

35:00.306 --> 35:01.808
-Okay.
-This way.

35:05.728 --> 35:08.356
Does he like to play go?

35:08.439 --> 35:09.565
I don't know.

35:09.649 --> 35:13.486
He loves it. He spends
his free time looking at game records.

35:15.571 --> 35:16.781
-Hey.
-Hey, Chief Hong.

35:16.864 --> 35:18.950
-Hey. Who won?
-Hey.

35:19.033 --> 35:21.202
It was a close match, but I won.

35:21.285 --> 35:22.745
Is that so?

35:23.746 --> 35:25.164
I'm sorry.

35:27.291 --> 35:29.127
Don't be sorry.

35:30.253 --> 35:32.922
Why are you still here?
Buy him some <i>jjajangmyeon</i>.

35:33.005 --> 35:34.340
Fine. Let's go eat it.

35:34.924 --> 35:36.050
-Well done.
-Okay.

35:36.134 --> 35:37.051
Come.

35:37.760 --> 35:39.929
-Order some <i>tangsuyuk</i> too.
-Got it.

35:40.012 --> 35:41.764
I won't go easy on you next time.

35:41.848 --> 35:43.099
Goodbye.

35:45.643 --> 35:47.061
Care for a game?

35:48.312 --> 35:49.564
Can you even play?

35:49.647 --> 35:51.816
Find out for yourself.

35:52.733 --> 35:55.486
-All right.
-Bring it on, then.

35:57.864 --> 36:00.324
You're going to do that right now?

36:01.409 --> 36:03.703
-Aren't we here to eat?
-Oh, dear.

36:08.457 --> 36:11.502
All right. Let's see.

36:40.364 --> 36:41.365
Here.

36:41.449 --> 36:45.494
We'll order after they're done playing.

36:45.578 --> 36:50.041
Sure. I should've just opened
a board game center instead.

36:52.084 --> 36:54.545
I can't believe
I-jun knows how to play go.

36:54.629 --> 36:56.589
He even does traditional painting.

36:58.466 --> 37:02.345
If he were born during the Joseon Dynasty,
he would've made a name for himself.

37:02.428 --> 37:03.971
I bet he'll be successful.

37:04.055 --> 37:06.224
You're the successful one.

37:06.307 --> 37:09.644
You must be very proud of your daughter.

37:09.727 --> 37:12.271
Right. I am.

37:12.355 --> 37:15.107
By the way, you look very young.

37:21.530 --> 37:23.741
-I'll let you guys be.
-Okay.

37:33.125 --> 37:34.543
Are you feeling unwell?

37:35.711 --> 37:39.298
No, it's nothing. Don't worry about it.

37:39.382 --> 37:41.467
You keep drinking water.

37:42.218 --> 37:43.469
Are you parched?

37:44.053 --> 37:45.596
Actually,

37:46.722 --> 37:48.140
I met with a doctor.

37:48.224 --> 37:50.351
Apparently, I have burning mouth syndrome.

37:50.935 --> 37:51.852
I see.

37:52.895 --> 37:57.483
Then is your mouth feeling hot?
Does it burn?

37:57.566 --> 38:00.444
A bit. I'm sure it'll go away.

38:06.659 --> 38:07.868
Have this.

38:10.746 --> 38:12.248
Thanks.

38:12.331 --> 38:17.128
You need to keep your mouth
hydrated at all times.

38:17.211 --> 38:20.172
Suck on candy or chew gum often.

38:20.256 --> 38:22.216
You should also drink a lot.

38:22.300 --> 38:25.094
Right. I'll get you some warm water.

38:25.177 --> 38:27.305
No, that's okay.

38:42.570 --> 38:46.699
I think you should know that
I've always had free <i>jjajangmyeon</i>.

38:47.491 --> 38:50.786
I was able
to feed myself with my go skills.

38:57.001 --> 38:58.210
Can you take that back?

38:58.294 --> 39:01.130
Come on. What do you take me for?

39:01.213 --> 39:03.257
Old age has been messing with my sight.

39:03.341 --> 39:06.093
Shouldn't you respect your elders?

39:06.177 --> 39:10.306
I believe it's unfair
to mention your age during a match.

39:10.973 --> 39:12.016
Forget it.

39:12.099 --> 39:14.477
Father, are you sulking?

39:14.560 --> 39:16.062
No, I'm not.

39:16.145 --> 39:18.397
And why do you address me that way?

39:18.481 --> 39:21.317
Then what else should I call you?

39:24.362 --> 39:26.155
Fine. I'll take it back.

39:26.238 --> 39:28.866
-But just this once.
-Forget it.

39:28.949 --> 39:32.495
Here. I took it back. It's your turn now.

39:32.578 --> 39:34.830
It's your turn. I took it back.

39:40.961 --> 39:44.548
Oh, dear. So that was your plan.

39:45.132 --> 39:46.675
In that case…

39:57.978 --> 39:58.938
Yeong-guk.

39:59.939 --> 40:01.357
Cho-hui.

40:03.192 --> 40:06.862
I just came by to see
how you were doing. I wanted…

40:06.946 --> 40:08.280
Take this.

40:08.864 --> 40:10.950
Vitamin C is good for your health.

40:11.033 --> 40:12.701
You didn't have to do this.

40:15.371 --> 40:17.623
I don't think I can invite you in,

40:17.706 --> 40:20.418
so can we talk outside?

40:22.169 --> 40:23.462
Just the two of us?

40:26.882 --> 40:28.592
-I'd love that.
-Okay.

40:37.059 --> 40:38.811
I'm bored out of my mind.

40:39.937 --> 40:45.734
How could you say that
when I even grilled that fish for you?

40:45.818 --> 40:47.278
You see,

40:48.654 --> 40:52.032
snacks taste the best
when you're gossiping.

40:52.783 --> 40:54.535
Anything interesting to talk about?

40:54.618 --> 40:56.662
You need to fix that bad habit of yours.

40:57.496 --> 41:01.625
Now, that's interesting.
It's Mr. Chang and Ms. Yu.

41:02.376 --> 41:05.379
Look at that.
This is going to be interesting.

41:05.463 --> 41:07.673
-Hey, you're here.
-Sit down.

41:12.511 --> 41:14.180
Don't do that!

41:17.641 --> 41:20.394
What would you like…

41:20.478 --> 41:22.938
All right. Got it.

41:34.575 --> 41:35.868
All right.

41:37.912 --> 41:39.497
-Are you guys done?
-Yes.

41:39.580 --> 41:41.373
So who won?

41:44.793 --> 41:46.462
Do you want some food?

41:46.545 --> 41:51.050
Sure. Please prepare a feast for us.
I'm counting on you.

41:51.133 --> 41:53.719
Okay. I'll prepare a lavish meal for you.

41:53.802 --> 41:55.763
Thanks. Is there anything you want…

41:57.348 --> 42:00.893
Come on. It's not my fault you lost.
Will you keep sulking like that?

42:00.976 --> 42:03.229
Wait up, Father. Gosh.

42:03.312 --> 42:04.563
Wait for me.

42:05.272 --> 42:06.440
NAM-SUK

42:07.983 --> 42:10.569
<i>-The person you have called…</i>
-Why isn't she picking up?

42:11.070 --> 42:13.113
I can't hear them
since they're too far away.

42:14.031 --> 42:15.491
You see, Cho-hui.

42:16.575 --> 42:19.078
There's something I want to tell you.

42:19.787 --> 42:20.788
Listen carefully.

42:27.503 --> 42:32.466
"To the love of my life.

42:34.885 --> 42:39.056
I will never forget you
until my very last breath.

42:39.640 --> 42:43.018
I know my chance will never come."

42:43.686 --> 42:46.272
-Can you hear them?
-He's reciting a poem.

42:46.355 --> 42:48.482
He's reciting a poem? That lunatic…

42:49.608 --> 42:53.988
"Please stay beautiful as you are."

42:56.115 --> 42:58.909
That's a poem by Yi Sang.

43:01.036 --> 43:05.291
Gosh, Cho-hui. You and I click so well.

43:05.374 --> 43:07.042
I think we're soulmates.

43:09.503 --> 43:10.504
The reason

43:12.089 --> 43:14.091
I recited his poem

43:14.967 --> 43:18.304
is that I still like--

43:18.387 --> 43:19.346
Yeong-guk.

43:20.014 --> 43:21.181
Yes?

43:22.933 --> 43:25.561
He's confessing his love,
but I can't hear that well.

43:25.644 --> 43:26.979
Me neither!

43:27.062 --> 43:28.689
You've been so good to me

43:29.273 --> 43:31.984
ever since we first met.

43:32.067 --> 43:33.819
I'm always grateful for that.

43:36.196 --> 43:37.948
-Don't mention it.
-However…

43:39.825 --> 43:42.328
I've never had any romantic feelings

43:43.579 --> 43:44.496
for you.

43:55.507 --> 43:59.219
I hope we can continue being good friends.

44:03.599 --> 44:05.267
Is this because of Hwa-jeong?

44:07.019 --> 44:08.062
What?

44:08.145 --> 44:10.773
You're turning me down

44:12.024 --> 44:14.026
and drawing the line

44:14.610 --> 44:15.986
because of her, aren't you?

44:16.070 --> 44:19.448
That's not true.
This has nothing to do with her.

44:22.910 --> 44:26.664
I should get going.

44:40.135 --> 44:43.472
Gosh, she has prepared

44:43.555 --> 44:45.307
all kinds of seafood for us.

44:45.391 --> 44:47.559
Father, try this.

44:47.643 --> 44:50.854
These sea squirts are known
for their scrumptious aftertaste.

44:50.938 --> 44:52.272
No, thanks.

44:52.356 --> 44:54.608
Honey, are you upset you lost the game?

44:54.692 --> 44:57.361
Gosh, you're too competitive.

44:57.444 --> 45:01.281
What? Ms. Dentist is the same.
She's also impossibly stubborn.

45:01.365 --> 45:02.616
You take after him.

45:02.699 --> 45:03.784
I'm not like him.

45:04.284 --> 45:06.954
Of course, she does.
Like father, like daughter.

45:07.496 --> 45:10.833
Gosh. I've noticed this
from the beginning,

45:10.916 --> 45:12.626
but you guys aren't close at all.

45:13.669 --> 45:16.839
What does it matter when you're family?

45:16.922 --> 45:19.341
It does matter. It's still a relationship.

45:19.425 --> 45:22.344
Mother, this won't do.
There's this ice breaker game

45:22.428 --> 45:24.471
called <i>Two Truths and One Lie.</i>

45:24.555 --> 45:26.432
They should play that.

45:26.515 --> 45:28.892
-Cut that nonsense.
-They should--

45:30.269 --> 45:32.771
When it's awkward like this,
it's best to just eat.

45:32.855 --> 45:35.607
Father, try some of this.

45:35.691 --> 45:38.110
Here. Open up.

45:38.193 --> 45:40.946
I don't eat anything slimy.

45:42.281 --> 45:44.074
He doesn't eat seafood.

45:44.158 --> 45:47.953
Goodness. You're all about the sauce
when having raw fish, aren't you?

45:48.036 --> 45:50.414
Just trust me and have a bite.

45:50.497 --> 45:53.125
I promise you that
you'll appreciate the taste of seafood.

45:53.208 --> 45:55.252
Why should I trust you?

45:55.919 --> 45:56.795
Because

45:57.921 --> 46:00.215
we played go together.

46:02.301 --> 46:07.097
My grandfather used to say,
"Playing go brings good friends.

46:07.598 --> 46:12.978
Being able to play the game together
means you're already good friends."

46:14.313 --> 46:17.191
What? Does that mean you two are friends?

46:17.274 --> 46:18.358
Don't be ridiculous.

46:18.442 --> 46:21.236
All right, open up. Come on.

46:21.320 --> 46:23.113
Open up.

46:23.197 --> 46:24.364
Good.

46:25.032 --> 46:27.993
Chew well. It'll taste salty at first,

46:28.076 --> 46:31.121
but then you'll get a hint of sourness.

46:31.205 --> 46:33.665
It seems like you like it.

46:33.749 --> 46:35.918
How is it? Doesn't it taste fresh?

46:36.001 --> 46:37.878
Well, it's not bad.

46:39.171 --> 46:42.549
Okay. You've mastered
sea squirts now. Next up are spoon worms.

46:42.633 --> 46:44.343
That's too disgusting to eat.

46:44.426 --> 46:46.011
I know, but the texture--

46:46.094 --> 46:47.262
-No way.
-Come on.

46:47.346 --> 46:49.056
-I don't want to.
-Try it. Come on.

46:49.139 --> 46:51.058
-I don't want to.
-Try it.

46:51.141 --> 46:52.434
-Never!
-Give it a go!

46:52.518 --> 46:55.145
-Come on!
-Try it. It's tasty.

46:55.229 --> 46:56.522
No, I don't want to.

46:56.605 --> 46:57.606
-Please.
-<i>It's strange.</i>

46:57.689 --> 47:00.400
-Try the spoon worm.
-<i>This is their first time meeting.</i>

47:00.484 --> 47:03.529
-If she cans, so can you.
-<i>So how does he seem</i>

47:03.612 --> 47:06.031
<i>to blend in so well?</i>

47:06.532 --> 47:08.116
-How is it?
<i>-How does he make us</i>

47:08.200 --> 47:10.244
-It's not bad.
<i>-feel so comfortable?</i>

47:10.327 --> 47:11.411
Now, the spoon worms.

47:11.495 --> 47:13.163
<i>How does he warm our hearts like so?</i>

47:13.247 --> 47:15.249
-I really can't eat that.
-The texture is--

47:15.332 --> 47:16.959
No. It disgusts me.

47:17.042 --> 47:18.335
I don't like raw food.

47:21.255 --> 47:23.382
Gosh, I can't believe
you finished two bowls.

47:23.465 --> 47:25.926
This is surprising
for someone who eats like a bird.

47:26.009 --> 47:29.513
It's because I'm eating
with my entire family.

47:29.596 --> 47:32.015
The best meal is one
that you have with your family.

47:32.099 --> 47:33.183
You're right.

47:34.685 --> 47:39.439
By the way,
it seems that this is your hometown.

47:39.523 --> 47:41.733
Does that mean you live with your parents?

47:41.817 --> 47:45.612
No, sir. They both passed away
when I was little.

47:46.947 --> 47:48.240
-Is that so?
-Yes.

47:48.323 --> 47:50.158
Then do you have other family members?

47:50.242 --> 47:52.828
Dad, that's a private matter.

47:52.911 --> 47:54.413
It's okay.

47:54.496 --> 47:55.706
My grandfather passed away

47:55.789 --> 47:57.457
when I was in middle school.

47:57.541 --> 47:58.417
Now, it's just me.

47:59.751 --> 48:03.005
Goodness. You must've been lonely.

48:03.714 --> 48:07.676
The people here have treated me
like family and taken great care of me.

48:08.260 --> 48:10.178
Shall we go?

48:10.262 --> 48:11.930
-How about some coffee?
-Sure.

48:12.014 --> 48:13.432
That sounds good.

48:13.515 --> 48:14.516
That's okay.

48:16.184 --> 48:19.146
Why not?
Let's have some coffee before we go.

48:19.229 --> 48:21.481
We should go now
if we want to avoid traffic.

48:21.565 --> 48:23.525
You're right. It's the weekend.

48:23.609 --> 48:26.236
Then I'll get some coffee to go.

48:26.320 --> 48:28.864
-You can drink it on your way--
-No, thanks.

48:29.364 --> 48:30.657
There's no need for that.

48:33.702 --> 48:34.911
Dad.

48:37.080 --> 48:39.583
Let me go to the bathroom.

48:39.666 --> 48:40.876
Okay.

48:49.468 --> 48:53.764
Dad, what is the matter?

48:54.389 --> 48:55.307
Were you aware

48:56.391 --> 48:59.686
that he was an orphan?

48:59.770 --> 49:03.440
"Orphan"? How could you say that?

49:04.066 --> 49:07.694
He had a family as well.
He just lost them when he was little.

49:08.278 --> 49:11.073
-It's not a sin to have no parents.
-It is.

49:12.366 --> 49:13.283
What?

49:13.367 --> 49:15.577
I have nothing personal against him,

49:16.244 --> 49:18.664
-but you shouldn't be seeing him.
-Dad.

49:18.747 --> 49:21.291
No parent in this world
would be supportive

49:21.375 --> 49:23.877
of their child dating an orphan!

49:23.960 --> 49:24.878
Honey!

49:24.961 --> 49:27.464
Break up before it gets any deeper.

49:27.547 --> 49:29.758
You haven't been dating for long.

49:30.550 --> 49:34.429
I don't want someone with a flaw like that
to be my family.

49:37.307 --> 49:41.353
In that case, I have a flaw as well.

49:41.436 --> 49:42.562
What?

49:42.646 --> 49:44.773
I also lost my mom when I was little.

49:44.856 --> 49:47.317
On top of that, I have a stepmom.

49:47.401 --> 49:48.485
Yoon Hye-jin!

49:48.568 --> 49:50.112
I have a flaw too.

49:50.195 --> 49:52.447
So why do you think
he's the only one with a flaw?

50:30.652 --> 50:32.070
Damn it.

50:32.821 --> 50:34.239
You even smoke?

50:35.741 --> 50:37.659
You do everything that's unhealthy.

50:38.702 --> 50:40.579
Even Hye-jin never nags at me.

50:47.586 --> 50:49.004
I'm sorry.

50:50.297 --> 50:51.882
With or without you present,

50:53.216 --> 50:55.594
I shouldn't have said what I said.

50:57.429 --> 50:59.014
She sure does take after you.

51:00.390 --> 51:04.352
She also admits to her mistakes quickly.

51:10.859 --> 51:12.402
This may sound like an excuse,

51:13.528 --> 51:16.031
but she was also lonely growing up.

51:18.492 --> 51:19.993
After her mother died,

51:21.036 --> 51:23.538
I relied on alcohol for a long time.

51:28.043 --> 51:30.086
<i>I was a neglectful father.</i>

51:30.170 --> 51:31.588
JIHYE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

51:31.671 --> 51:34.174
<i>Never once did I pack her backpack.</i>

51:36.593 --> 51:37.803
<i>Thanks to my negligence,</i>

51:39.012 --> 51:41.389
<i>she grew up too fast.</i>

51:42.808 --> 51:45.018
I'm going to school.

51:47.020 --> 51:49.105
<i>I'll carry that guilt with me forever.</i>

51:53.151 --> 51:54.945
It's not that I don't like you.

51:55.821 --> 51:59.241
And I know it's selfish of me to expect
someone else to do what I couldn't.

52:01.076 --> 52:04.162
But I hope she marries into a big family

52:04.913 --> 52:06.915
so that she never gets lonely again.

52:08.083 --> 52:10.710
Finally receiving the love she couldn't.

52:13.922 --> 52:16.341
You got it all wrong.

52:16.925 --> 52:17.801
Hye-jin…

52:19.469 --> 52:21.263
received tons of love growing up.

52:24.850 --> 52:26.810
If not, she wouldn't be able

52:27.394 --> 52:30.146
to give others so much love.

52:37.320 --> 52:38.989
The weather's so nice.

52:45.161 --> 52:47.080
I apologize for what I said earlier.

52:48.248 --> 52:49.833
It was wrong of me.

52:51.126 --> 52:54.838
That's okay.
Your dad crossed the line first.

53:00.886 --> 53:01.887
Hye-jin.

53:02.721 --> 53:04.556
That's just how parents feel.

53:05.891 --> 53:09.311
To be frank,
what he said was downright unfair.

53:09.394 --> 53:14.065
But you see, it's hard
to be objective about your own child.

53:14.858 --> 53:17.527
It's easy to spot other people's flaws,

53:17.611 --> 53:19.362
but not your own child's.

53:19.446 --> 53:22.824
You just want to turn a blind eye to it.

53:24.492 --> 53:27.871
I promise to tell him off big time,

53:27.954 --> 53:29.915
so don't resent him too much.

53:30.999 --> 53:34.753
That'd be too harsh of a punishment
for someone who dotes on you.

53:36.922 --> 53:37.923
He does?

53:39.883 --> 53:41.635
We visited a dozen flower shops

53:41.718 --> 53:45.013
before finally buying those orchids.

53:52.854 --> 53:55.523
I'm looking for something
meaningful and rare.

53:56.274 --> 53:59.069
Something that brings
success, good health,

53:59.152 --> 54:01.112
and luck.

54:01.905 --> 54:04.950
<i>The wallpaper on his phone
is you as a little girl.</i>

54:09.454 --> 54:12.457
I heard it's pouring in Gangwon Province.

54:13.208 --> 54:15.293
I'm worried about Hye-jin.

54:16.086 --> 54:18.338
Give her a call if you're worried.

54:20.674 --> 54:23.593
I heard there will be a typhoon too.

54:28.139 --> 54:31.851
<i>He doesn't care
about the weather back home,</i>

54:31.935 --> 54:35.522
but he always knows
how the weather is down here.

54:36.231 --> 54:37.565
That's not all.

54:37.649 --> 54:39.484
He's quiet at home.

54:39.567 --> 54:42.487
But he becomes chatty
and boasts about you when he goes out.

54:43.029 --> 54:46.032
Soon, he's going to have no friends left.

54:50.954 --> 54:51.871
Hye-jin.

54:53.623 --> 54:57.919
At times, you guys may bicker
because you don't always see eye to eye,

54:58.586 --> 55:02.298
but he always has
nothing but love for you.

55:13.810 --> 55:16.688
Do you like her a lot?

55:21.026 --> 55:21.943
Yes.

55:25.196 --> 55:26.364
But…

55:27.699 --> 55:29.576
I like her as a friend.

55:31.536 --> 55:33.872
What do you mean?

55:35.123 --> 55:37.917
We're actually just friends.

55:39.461 --> 55:42.297
I had no choice but to lie
since there was a misunderstanding.

55:44.215 --> 55:46.009
Nothing you might worry about happened.

55:48.261 --> 55:50.680
-I'm sorry.
-So you're telling me

55:51.514 --> 55:54.476
that you're not my daughter's boyfriend?

55:54.559 --> 55:55.393
Yes.

55:56.352 --> 55:58.271
But I meant what I said.

55:59.439 --> 56:01.441
She's a warmhearted person.

56:01.941 --> 56:03.401
So I…

56:05.445 --> 56:08.281
truly hope that she'll find
someone good that she deserves.

56:10.784 --> 56:11.868
And that…

56:14.204 --> 56:15.830
could be you.

56:25.548 --> 56:30.887
HWAJEONG RAW FISH RESTAURANT

56:35.058 --> 56:37.102
Oh, you came out.

56:39.687 --> 56:41.981
Let's go eat something.

56:43.942 --> 56:45.360
We just did.

56:45.443 --> 56:46.820
Right.

56:46.903 --> 56:49.739
Then how about some coffee?

56:51.366 --> 56:52.742
I prefer tea.

56:54.160 --> 56:55.745
We seriously don't get along.

56:57.497 --> 56:59.666
What an awkward relationship they have.

56:59.749 --> 57:02.001
Really? I think it's nice.

57:03.419 --> 57:04.879
Wait up.

57:08.842 --> 57:11.845
Let me take you
to a place that serves good tea.

57:11.928 --> 57:15.265
But to be frank, I make the best tea.

57:16.599 --> 57:17.851
All right.

57:20.895 --> 57:21.896
Gosh.

57:24.107 --> 57:25.400
Okay.

57:25.483 --> 57:26.484
All right.

57:27.819 --> 57:28.820
Okay.

57:29.863 --> 57:31.573
I can't be late again.

57:36.202 --> 57:37.745
Aren't you tutoring today?

57:37.829 --> 57:38.830
Yes.

57:39.372 --> 57:42.459
They're brother and sister,
and they never listen to me.

57:42.542 --> 57:44.669
Really? Call me if you need help.

57:44.752 --> 57:46.212
I'm good with kids.

57:46.296 --> 57:48.590
I once aspired
to become a preschool teacher.

57:48.673 --> 57:50.091
Don't lie.

57:50.175 --> 57:51.968
I'm serious.

57:52.051 --> 57:53.928
-Really?
-Yes.

57:54.012 --> 57:57.056
Okay. I'm going to the restroom.

57:57.140 --> 57:57.974
Sure.

58:04.314 --> 58:05.899
<i>ROMAGNA</i>

58:08.276 --> 58:11.196
"I have a free ticket.

58:12.030 --> 58:13.448
Would you like…

58:16.284 --> 58:17.911
I heard this musical is fun.

58:17.994 --> 58:20.288
Let's watch it together
if you have time, Hye-jin.

58:20.371 --> 58:21.623
They sing like this."

58:29.255 --> 58:30.089
Hye-jin.

58:30.590 --> 58:32.467
-Gang-uk.
-What are you doing here?

58:32.550 --> 58:35.053
I'm having coffee with my friend.

58:35.136 --> 58:36.054
Hey, Seong-hyeon.

58:36.137 --> 58:37.514
Hey, Gang-uk.

58:37.597 --> 58:38.932
What a small world.

58:39.015 --> 58:41.476
I was going to introduce her
to you next time we met.

58:41.559 --> 58:43.603
Say hi. This is
my girlfriend, Yoon Hye-jin.

58:43.686 --> 58:46.773
Wait. Do you two know each other?

58:46.856 --> 58:48.816
Oh, I see.

58:48.900 --> 58:51.277
He's my high school friend.
Didn't I tell you?

58:51.361 --> 58:52.362
I see.

58:53.029 --> 58:55.490
No way. This is crazy.

58:55.573 --> 58:58.368
-This is amazing.
-You're right.

58:58.451 --> 59:01.496
Gosh. You guys look good together.

59:02.038 --> 59:03.373
I can't believe this.

59:10.213 --> 59:11.339
Here.

59:12.090 --> 59:13.216
-Done?
-Yes.

59:14.050 --> 59:14.884
Gosh.

59:17.011 --> 59:19.180
-Here you go.
-Goodness.

59:25.311 --> 59:27.230
-It doesn't fit.
-Should we make it again?

59:27.313 --> 59:29.482
-No, it's too late.
-It's not too late!

59:38.074 --> 59:40.451
I'm just saying that it's not too late

59:40.535 --> 59:43.121
even though you think it is…

59:43.204 --> 59:45.081
What are you doing? Make it again.

59:45.665 --> 59:46.624
Don't look at me.

59:47.667 --> 59:49.544
-Don't.
-What's wrong with you?

59:52.880 --> 59:54.132
A dog is barking.

59:57.427 --> 59:59.804
We had a blast today thanks to you.

59:59.887 --> 1:00:02.724
It was my pleasure.
I also had fun thanks to you.

1:00:02.807 --> 1:00:07.020
About that coffee stain,
rub it with some baking soda,

1:00:07.103 --> 1:00:09.439
detergent mixed with vinegar,

1:00:09.522 --> 1:00:11.316
or carbonated water.

1:00:11.399 --> 1:00:13.818
You'd make a better housewife than me.

1:00:13.901 --> 1:00:16.029
What do you not know?

1:00:16.779 --> 1:00:18.448
Dad, drive safely.

1:00:18.531 --> 1:00:19.365
All right.

1:00:19.449 --> 1:00:23.119
Father, pull over if you get drowsy.

1:00:23.202 --> 1:00:24.370
It can be dangerous.

1:00:24.454 --> 1:00:26.956
You. Can you come over here?

1:00:27.040 --> 1:00:28.416
Me?

1:00:29.042 --> 1:00:31.794
Goodness. I wonder
what he wants to tell me.

1:00:35.673 --> 1:00:37.967
-Closer.
-What is it?

1:00:38.676 --> 1:00:41.804
Wait. I get ticklish
when someone whispers in my ear.

1:00:42.305 --> 1:00:43.306
Fine.

1:00:47.143 --> 1:00:50.021
Why do you talk casually to me?

1:00:50.104 --> 1:00:53.316
Oh, that? It's sort of
a philosophy of mine.

1:00:54.067 --> 1:00:57.612
Simply put, it sounds
more friendly that way.

1:01:00.615 --> 1:01:02.325
Not to me, you bastard.

1:01:03.326 --> 1:01:06.579
-We'll get going then.
-Okay. Drive safely.

1:01:06.663 --> 1:01:08.081
-Bye.
-Bye.

1:01:15.630 --> 1:01:17.340
-What did he say?
-Pardon?

1:01:17.423 --> 1:01:19.550
-"Pardon"?
-Pardon? I…

1:01:20.635 --> 1:01:22.011
What did…

1:01:24.555 --> 1:01:26.849
What did he say to you?

1:01:33.022 --> 1:01:35.149
You like him, don't you?

1:01:35.733 --> 1:01:36.567
What?

1:01:37.860 --> 1:01:42.490
How about we get some snacks
at a rest area if the traffic gets heavy?

1:01:42.573 --> 1:01:44.867
I know you have a sweet tooth.

1:01:44.951 --> 1:01:47.453
It's okay. I already have a snack.

1:01:48.037 --> 1:01:49.247
What?

1:02:02.427 --> 1:02:05.763
Why did you follow me
all the way here? You're being a nuisance.

1:02:05.847 --> 1:02:09.308
Well, you see,
I tend to be the curious type.

1:02:09.392 --> 1:02:11.102
You're not answering my question.

1:02:12.979 --> 1:02:16.566
I've always been curious.

1:02:17.066 --> 1:02:18.818
Is this your boat?

1:02:18.901 --> 1:02:19.819
Yes.

1:02:19.902 --> 1:02:22.572
Why did you bring it up here?

1:02:23.239 --> 1:02:27.493
I mean, how did you even bring it here?

1:02:27.577 --> 1:02:30.496
I looked for a helicopter
and even rented a truck.

1:02:30.580 --> 1:02:32.373
It was quite difficult.

1:02:32.457 --> 1:02:34.250
But in the end, I succeeded.

1:02:34.333 --> 1:02:36.961
So why did you do such a thing?

1:02:37.044 --> 1:02:38.588
Boats belong in the ocean.

1:02:38.671 --> 1:02:40.798
I wanted it to appreciate a different view

1:02:40.882 --> 1:02:43.217
since it had been sailing all its life.

1:02:43.968 --> 1:02:46.345
To tell you the truth,
this was my grandfather's.

1:02:48.473 --> 1:02:49.474
I see.

1:02:51.684 --> 1:02:54.061
You're definitely not normal.

1:02:55.021 --> 1:02:58.316
You wasted money and time
for such a sentimental reason?

1:02:59.609 --> 1:03:01.986
I was expecting to hear
some grand explanation.

1:03:07.408 --> 1:03:09.702
Why do you live here like this?

1:03:10.495 --> 1:03:12.121
Are you picking a fight with me?

1:03:12.205 --> 1:03:14.165
No, I'm asking out of pure curiosity.

1:03:15.291 --> 1:03:18.711
What did you do
after graduating from college?

1:03:19.378 --> 1:03:21.714
I mean, during those five years.

1:03:25.718 --> 1:03:29.722
Fine. The past is in the past.
What's important is the present.

1:03:31.474 --> 1:03:34.727
You're just taking a break now, right?

1:03:35.728 --> 1:03:37.021
I get it.

1:03:37.104 --> 1:03:40.566
You get tired.
You can't run a marathon forever.

1:03:40.650 --> 1:03:42.068
You came down here

1:03:42.151 --> 1:03:44.570
to refresh yourself
and plan for your future.

1:03:45.154 --> 1:03:46.697
This is temporary, right?

1:03:46.781 --> 1:03:49.700
You're wrong.
I'm going to live like this forever.

1:03:52.662 --> 1:03:54.121
I'm content with this life.

1:03:54.747 --> 1:03:56.415
You must be kidding me.

1:03:56.499 --> 1:03:59.710
That's a total waste of resources.

1:03:59.794 --> 1:04:03.339
It's like playing Minesweeper
on a high-tech computer.

1:04:03.422 --> 1:04:06.676
You're driving a sports car
across the rice paddies

1:04:06.759 --> 1:04:08.511
instead of the highway.

1:04:09.095 --> 1:04:12.765
Don't look down on the beauty
of simplicity Minesweeper has to offer.

1:04:12.849 --> 1:04:15.726
And rice paddies look magnificent
on a summer night.

1:04:15.810 --> 1:04:16.894
You have no idea.

1:04:18.771 --> 1:04:19.897
Right.

1:04:19.981 --> 1:04:22.984
I was crazy to think I could actually
have a conversation with you.

1:04:23.067 --> 1:04:26.195
Do you want a flower in your hair
to look like a pretty lunatic?

1:04:27.029 --> 1:04:28.030
No, thanks.

1:04:32.618 --> 1:04:34.036
It's going to be a long walk.

1:04:35.454 --> 1:04:36.455
Goodbye, then.

1:04:51.012 --> 1:04:52.013
Darn it.

1:04:52.096 --> 1:04:56.475
I'm mortified that I had
some kind of hope even for a moment.

1:04:59.687 --> 1:05:03.816
Mi-seon, why did you call Chief Hong over…

1:05:08.613 --> 1:05:09.614
Why are you crying?

1:05:11.073 --> 1:05:13.492
I asked Eun-cheol out,

1:05:14.243 --> 1:05:15.328
but he said no.

1:05:24.879 --> 1:05:26.380
Don't cry.

1:05:48.194 --> 1:05:51.113
YOON DENTAL CLINIC

1:06:00.581 --> 1:06:02.959
Take the call. I'll take it from here.

1:06:03.042 --> 1:06:04.210
I'm sorry.

1:06:08.923 --> 1:06:10.883
Mom, I'm working.

1:06:13.219 --> 1:06:16.138
What? Is it serious?

1:06:17.306 --> 1:06:19.475
Where did you hurt yourself?

1:06:19.558 --> 1:06:22.687
She put her hand down as she fell.

1:06:22.770 --> 1:06:24.480
Yes, it's a compound fracture.

1:06:25.314 --> 1:06:28.359
Would she be able to have surgery
as soon as possible?

1:06:29.819 --> 1:06:31.612
Okay. Thanks.

1:06:31.696 --> 1:06:32.822
Thank you.

1:06:35.157 --> 1:06:37.284
Fortunately, my friend had
some time today,

1:06:37.368 --> 1:06:38.911
so I scheduled the surgery.

1:06:39.578 --> 1:06:42.039
Don't worry. The surgery will go well.

1:06:42.748 --> 1:06:43.874
Thanks.

1:06:44.375 --> 1:06:46.502
Let's go to Seoul right now.

1:06:47.169 --> 1:06:48.170
You're coming?

1:06:48.254 --> 1:06:51.298
Of course. We should cancel
our afternoon appointments.

1:06:51.382 --> 1:06:53.718
But Ms. Lee Jeong-yeon
is coming by in the evening

1:06:53.801 --> 1:06:55.970
because her makeshift tooth fell out.

1:06:56.053 --> 1:06:57.638
She needs to get that treated.

1:06:58.305 --> 1:07:00.641
You should stay here. I'll go by myself.

1:07:09.400 --> 1:07:11.444
Just go straight to Seoul in this.

1:07:11.527 --> 1:07:14.405
My dad and Hyeon-seon already arrived.

1:07:14.488 --> 1:07:17.241
I can just take the bus
at the terminal. I should get going.

1:07:17.324 --> 1:07:18.909
Call me as soon as you get there.

1:07:18.993 --> 1:07:20.077
-Okay.
-All right.

1:07:25.041 --> 1:07:26.417
Oh, my goodness.

1:07:27.001 --> 1:07:28.627
What are you doing here?

1:07:29.295 --> 1:07:30.796
Is she going somewhere?

1:07:31.505 --> 1:07:32.548
Well…

1:07:45.853 --> 1:07:46.771
Ms. Pyo!

1:07:47.772 --> 1:07:48.689
Officer Choi.

1:07:48.773 --> 1:07:50.483
Get in. I'll drive you to Seoul.

1:07:50.566 --> 1:07:51.817
What?

1:07:51.901 --> 1:07:53.027
Come on.

1:07:56.280 --> 1:07:58.407
Thank you. How did you know?

1:08:05.289 --> 1:08:06.791
You're going back to Seoul today?

1:08:06.874 --> 1:08:09.877
Yes. I'm coming back next week.

1:08:09.960 --> 1:08:13.089
Try to focus more on the subtitles.

1:08:13.756 --> 1:08:16.133
Your show tends to lack in that area

1:08:16.217 --> 1:08:17.760
compared to the other shows.

1:08:19.386 --> 1:08:20.805
Thanks for the advice.

1:08:20.888 --> 1:08:21.931
My pleasure.

1:08:25.017 --> 1:08:27.978
Did Hye-jin's parents go home safely?

1:08:28.062 --> 1:08:29.480
I think so.

1:08:31.273 --> 1:08:33.776
Look, I'm just asking out of curiosity.

1:08:34.360 --> 1:08:36.195
You're done with that job, right?

1:08:40.366 --> 1:08:42.827
Yes. I worked 7 hours and made 61,040 won.

1:08:42.910 --> 1:08:44.245
It was a great success.

1:08:44.829 --> 1:08:48.582
Really? Then why does it seem
the job is still ongoing?

1:08:50.042 --> 1:08:51.544
Then maybe it is.

1:08:53.462 --> 1:08:54.755
Have a safe trip.

1:08:57.675 --> 1:08:59.009
Gosh.

1:09:03.931 --> 1:09:06.851
I came out for a quiet walk.
Why are you tagging along?

1:09:07.518 --> 1:09:08.519
What are you, a leech?

1:09:08.602 --> 1:09:11.105
Hey, I'm also just trying to exercise.

1:09:11.188 --> 1:09:14.608
It's not easy
to maintain this figure, you know?

1:09:15.860 --> 1:09:18.696
Oh, my. Isn't that Yeong-guk?

1:09:18.779 --> 1:09:19.613
Yeong-guk!

1:09:20.531 --> 1:09:22.408
You. Take a detour.

1:09:22.992 --> 1:09:23.909
Why?

1:09:31.375 --> 1:09:34.461
Why are you drink here alone
when you can't even hold your liquor?

1:09:34.545 --> 1:09:36.255
I've only had one sip so far.

1:09:36.338 --> 1:09:38.215
Two sips, and you'll die.

1:09:39.341 --> 1:09:40.593
Just go home and sleep.

1:09:40.676 --> 1:09:42.261
It's all your fault.

1:09:44.513 --> 1:09:48.225
Cho-hui turned me down because of you.

1:09:49.560 --> 1:09:52.479
I'm sorry you failed to win
your first love's heart once again.

1:09:53.063 --> 1:09:56.901
But don't you think
it's so unfair to blame that on me?

1:09:59.778 --> 1:10:01.697
That's rich coming from you.

1:10:02.698 --> 1:10:04.658
Did you forget
what you did three years ago?

1:10:07.119 --> 1:10:12.166
You wanted a divorce just because
I took off my socks inside out.

1:10:12.249 --> 1:10:15.753
I promised that
I wouldn't do that ever again.

1:10:16.295 --> 1:10:21.592
I begged and asked you for forgiveness,
but you kicked me out that day.

1:10:22.509 --> 1:10:25.638
I was downright dumbfounded.

1:10:27.056 --> 1:10:29.099
But I accepted it. Do you know why?

1:10:30.517 --> 1:10:33.938
Because you said
you couldn't live with me anymore.

1:10:37.149 --> 1:10:40.819
I did everything you wanted.

1:10:40.903 --> 1:10:44.448
So why do you keep getting in my way?

1:10:44.531 --> 1:10:49.370
You'll never know why I wanted a divorce.

1:10:50.162 --> 1:10:52.831
Fine. Let's keep it that way forever.

1:10:53.540 --> 1:10:55.084
Just live your life.

1:10:56.794 --> 1:10:58.837
Hey, Hwa-jeong.

1:11:00.297 --> 1:11:02.049
What did you mean by that?

1:11:02.132 --> 1:11:04.885
Why are you insinuating
that there was another reason?

1:11:07.054 --> 1:11:10.266
You can't just leave like this.
Do you want me to suffer forever?

1:11:10.349 --> 1:11:11.433
-Hey!
-Gosh.

1:11:12.017 --> 1:11:15.437
What are you doing?
You can't grab her like that.

1:11:15.521 --> 1:11:16.647
You're a civil servant.

1:11:16.730 --> 1:11:19.441
She may be your ex-wife,
but you have no right to do that.

1:11:19.525 --> 1:11:22.528
I only grabbed her
because I wanted to talk.

1:11:22.611 --> 1:11:24.947
Besides, I've always had a weak grip,

1:11:25.030 --> 1:11:27.658
so she's beaten me
in arm-wrestling every single time.

1:11:27.741 --> 1:11:30.661
-Right?
-Yes. He's weak as a kitten.

1:11:33.622 --> 1:11:36.292
Don't forget that I have eyes everywhere.

1:11:37.042 --> 1:11:37.960
I know.

1:11:38.043 --> 1:11:41.964
And why did you have to mention
Cho-hui to her? You're pathetic.

1:11:42.047 --> 1:11:43.257
Hwa-jeong!

1:11:45.384 --> 1:11:46.218
Gosh.

1:11:46.302 --> 1:11:47.761
Wait up.

1:11:50.806 --> 1:11:52.266
I'll pretend I didn't see that.

1:11:52.850 --> 1:11:53.892
As if.

1:11:54.643 --> 1:11:55.644
Right?

1:11:56.562 --> 1:11:58.188
I can't promise you that.

1:11:59.148 --> 1:12:01.025
It's better to talk about it, you know?

1:12:01.692 --> 1:12:04.653
If you keep bottling up your emotions,

1:12:04.737 --> 1:12:06.196
you'll get sick.

1:12:06.280 --> 1:12:08.574
Talking is like pooping.

1:12:08.657 --> 1:12:11.869
You need to relieve yourself
regularly to stay healthy.

1:12:14.830 --> 1:12:16.457
You're unhealthy right now.

1:12:56.705 --> 1:12:57.956
Hey, Seong-hyeon.

1:12:58.040 --> 1:12:59.833
<i>Hey, where are you?</i>

1:12:59.917 --> 1:13:01.752
I got off work.

1:13:01.835 --> 1:13:03.212
I'm on my way home.

1:13:03.295 --> 1:13:06.882
I see. I'm on my way to Seoul.

1:13:06.965 --> 1:13:10.719
I had to leave right away,
so I couldn't even say bye to you.

1:13:10.803 --> 1:13:14.348
That's fine. You were busy. I understand.

1:13:14.890 --> 1:13:16.266
You're coming back anyway.

1:13:16.350 --> 1:13:17.810
Right.

1:13:20.687 --> 1:13:21.980
Hye-jin.

1:13:22.064 --> 1:13:23.273
<i>Yes?</i>

1:13:24.108 --> 1:13:27.236
When I go back down to Gongjin,
can you meet up with me?

1:13:27.319 --> 1:13:28.612
Meet up?

1:13:29.446 --> 1:13:30.656
Of course, I can.

1:13:31.532 --> 1:13:33.659
I really hope you can.

1:13:34.618 --> 1:13:36.662
I have something to tell you.

1:13:37.162 --> 1:13:37.996
<i>What?</i>

1:13:46.255 --> 1:13:47.881
They fixed the streetlamp.

1:13:51.885 --> 1:13:53.178
It's finally working.

1:13:57.391 --> 1:13:58.684
Are you happy

1:13:59.768 --> 1:14:02.396
that you could fix it today?

1:14:02.479 --> 1:14:04.857
Yes. I feel great.

1:14:04.940 --> 1:14:07.234
You put off such a simple task.

1:14:07.317 --> 1:14:10.696
An IT powerhouse
should always keep the people safe.

1:14:10.779 --> 1:14:11.780
I'll get going.

1:14:11.864 --> 1:14:14.491
Where are you going?
I have a ton of complaints.

1:14:14.575 --> 1:14:17.161
Listen carefully. Number one.

1:14:17.244 --> 1:14:19.955
How could there be
no Wi-Fi at the community center?

1:14:20.038 --> 1:14:22.458
The elderly enjoy watching videos online.

1:14:22.541 --> 1:14:24.835
Number two. The garbage bags…

1:14:26.128 --> 1:14:29.047
<i>Hye-jin, are you there?</i>

1:14:29.131 --> 1:14:30.340
Yes, I am.

1:14:31.633 --> 1:14:34.428
Let me know when you're back.

1:14:34.511 --> 1:14:36.221
I'll treat you to a meal.

1:14:36.305 --> 1:14:38.140
Okay. I'll see you soon.

1:14:38.765 --> 1:14:41.351
<i>Okay. Drive safely.</i>

1:14:41.435 --> 1:14:42.269
I will.

1:14:57.034 --> 1:15:00.078
No. I can't be late again.

1:15:40.452 --> 1:15:42.579
<i>She's a warmhearted person.</i>

1:15:43.163 --> 1:15:44.456
<i>So I…</i>

1:15:46.416 --> 1:15:49.169
<i>truly hope that she'll find
someone good that she deserves.</i>

1:15:50.420 --> 1:15:53.882
<i>And that could be you.</i>

1:16:27.791 --> 1:16:29.376
MEDICAL CHART

1:16:30.544 --> 1:16:33.213
It seems you're sleeping better now.

1:16:33.755 --> 1:16:37.634
At this rate,
I think we can lower the dosage.

1:16:39.136 --> 1:16:40.387
Okay.

1:16:40.470 --> 1:16:41.638
Great.

1:16:42.973 --> 1:16:44.141
Today,

1:16:44.224 --> 1:16:48.770
we're going to get
to the root of your fear.

1:16:50.564 --> 1:16:52.149
Do you still feel that…

1:16:54.276 --> 1:16:56.278
those around you…

1:16:59.865 --> 1:17:03.076
Goodness. What an unfortunate boy.

1:17:03.160 --> 1:17:06.371
As if losing his parents early wasn't
enough, he lost his grandpa too.

1:17:06.955 --> 1:17:08.165
Goodness.

1:17:08.832 --> 1:17:13.128
I guess it's true that some people
bring death to those around them.

1:17:28.602 --> 1:17:30.979
<i>So everyone you loved</i>

1:17:32.522 --> 1:17:35.984
<i>has left you?</i>

1:17:37.819 --> 1:17:38.820
<i>Yes.</i>

1:17:40.197 --> 1:17:41.406
And I'm to blame.

1:17:50.832 --> 1:17:52.167
It's because of me.

1:18:36.211 --> 1:18:37.796
Gosh, I was so scared.

1:18:39.047 --> 1:18:40.465
Chief Hong.

1:18:41.842 --> 1:18:43.677
-<i>Would you like to say hello?</i>
-Hello.

1:18:43.760 --> 1:18:46.555
I'm Yoon Hye-jin.

1:18:46.638 --> 1:18:47.806
Gosh.

1:18:47.889 --> 1:18:51.685
<i>You keep talking about Gongjin
as if all roads lead there.</i>

1:18:51.768 --> 1:18:55.313
Du-sik, life may seem long,

1:18:55.397 --> 1:18:57.357
<i>but it really isn't.</i>

1:18:58.400 --> 1:18:59.317
Chief Hong.

1:18:59.401 --> 1:19:02.904
I've been regretting
not telling you how I felt 14 years ago.

1:19:02.988 --> 1:19:05.782
<i>The conclusion I came to is this.</i>

1:19:05.866 --> 1:19:08.368
I like you.

1:19:09.870 --> 1:19:14.875
