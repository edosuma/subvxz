00:27.913 --> 00:31.508
No one's around. Leave a message.

00:31.913 --> 00:36.145
Hey. It's me, leaving a message.

00:38.073 --> 00:43.101
I haven't heard from you in a while.
Just checkin' in, hoping you're OK.

00:45.233 --> 00:47.463
All right.

00:47.553 --> 00:48.781
Take it easy.

00:56.593 --> 00:59.585
Things are still weird
between you and Logan, huh?

01:01.433 --> 01:03.310
Define "weird".

01:04.233 --> 01:08.511
"Weird" as in he's still upset that the
12-hour window you had to be together

01:08.593 --> 01:11.153
got slammed shut on his fingers.

01:11.233 --> 01:15.351
When you put it that way,
yeah, things are still weird.

01:16.793 --> 01:20.832
Did it occur to you that maybe this cure
worked better than you thought?

01:20.913 --> 01:23.871
That virus bitch could be
out of your system for good.

01:23.953 --> 01:29.823
No. I went to see Delbert, the lab geek.
He said the bug's back full blast.

01:29.913 --> 01:32.427
I touch Logan, he dies.

01:35.513 --> 01:39.108
Hey. This is the part
where you're supposed to say that

01:39.193 --> 01:44.187
Logan and me have been through worse,
and we're gonna get through this.

01:44.273 --> 01:47.948
Straight up. Now, come on.
You're gonna be late to work.

01:48.033 --> 01:51.548
- Tell Normal I'm sick.
- Not again, boo!

01:51.633 --> 01:55.023
- You've gotta get outta this apartment.
- I'm going to.

01:55.113 --> 02:00.471
I'm just gonna get out of town for the day.
You know, take a ride, clear my head.

02:00.553 --> 02:03.704
All right. Sounds like you got a plan.

02:03.793 --> 02:06.261
Yeah. I just need to score some gas.

02:25.113 --> 02:27.991
Hey! Excuse me. We were in front of you.

02:28.073 --> 02:30.268
You snooze, you lose.

02:54.833 --> 02:59.429
- That's it.
- Truck's tapped, people. Everybody go home.

03:01.033 --> 03:06.312
Hey. I got a rally in Portland tomorrow, man.
How am I gonna make it without any gas?

03:06.393 --> 03:11.387
Lots of lonely truckers out there. Pretty boy
like you would have no trouble getting a ride.

03:13.233 --> 03:15.463
I ain't leaving without my gas!

03:24.513 --> 03:26.629
Joey! Joey, stop!

03:26.713 --> 03:29.785
Somebody help us! Somebody help!

03:31.113 --> 03:32.341
Joey!

03:54.313 --> 03:58.989
They designed her to be the perfect soldier,
a human weapon.

03:59.073 --> 04:01.064
Then she escaped.

04:01.153 --> 04:05.544
In a future not far from now,
in a broken world,

04:05.633 --> 04:07.988
she is haunted by her past.

04:08.073 --> 04:13.147
She cannot run.
She must fight to discover her destiny.

05:01.793 --> 05:05.786
Hey! Hey, break it up!
Take your hands off him!

05:13.753 --> 05:17.985
Gunshot wound to the abdomen.
Respirations are shallow. Pulse 135.

05:18.073 --> 05:21.383
- Blood pressure?
- 80 over 40 and dropping. Belly's indurated.

05:21.473 --> 05:24.146
- Bullet might've hit a blood vessel.
- Extremities?

05:24.233 --> 05:28.545
- No indication of a spinal cord injury.
- Let's prep her for surgery.

05:31.233 --> 05:35.829
Hoping you're OK. Anyway, take it easy.

05:48.353 --> 05:52.062
You've reached my pager.
Punch in your number.

05:53.553 --> 05:55.987
Come on, people.

05:56.073 --> 05:58.792
- Hurry it up.
- She's lost a lot of blood.

05:58.873 --> 06:01.751
One, two, three.

06:02.873 --> 06:04.909
- Gotta hurry. Let's do it.
- Where am I?

06:04.993 --> 06:08.065
Harbor Lights Medical.
You've had an accident.

06:10.753 --> 06:13.313
- I can't stay.
- Why not? Your copay too high?

06:13.393 --> 06:16.351
Try to relax.
We're gonna take good care of you.

06:16.433 --> 06:18.867
- Get her typed and cross-matched.
- No tests.

06:18.953 --> 06:20.989
- You'll be OK.
- No tests!

06:21.073 --> 06:24.463
- Just try to relax.
- A little help here?

06:48.313 --> 06:52.067
- Hello?
- Hello. To whom am I speaking?

06:52.153 --> 06:55.463
Well, that depends. To whom am I speaking?

06:55.553 --> 06:59.341
Julie Camby, a nurse at
the emergency room at Harbor Lights.

06:59.433 --> 07:02.982
- And you are...?
- Wondering why you're calling me.

07:03.073 --> 07:06.349
We treated a young woman
this morning for a gunshot wound.

07:06.433 --> 07:12.144
She had no identification, only a pager,
and yours was the last number to call in.

07:13.513 --> 07:18.541
- Still with me, sir?
- Would you mind describing the woman?

07:19.113 --> 07:22.344
Five-six, long brown hair... Pretty.

07:22.433 --> 07:24.822
Bar code tattoo on the back of her neck...

07:24.913 --> 07:28.030
- Is she OK?
- Her doctor tells me she's doing fine.

07:28.113 --> 07:32.709
- Been out of surgery an hour now. Resting.
- Can I see her?

07:32.793 --> 07:35.387
- That depends.
- On what?

07:35.473 --> 07:38.271
Can't issue a guest pass
unless I know your name.

07:38.353 --> 07:40.548
Her name might help, too.

07:41.553 --> 07:43.623
Linda Eastman. Got it.

07:43.713 --> 07:47.626
Room 614. Her attending
is a Dr Colleen Harrington.

07:47.713 --> 07:51.422
I know her. I'll call and explain
that Linda is a patient of mine.

07:51.513 --> 07:53.549
I doubt she'll mind giving me the case.

07:53.633 --> 07:56.864
- How fast can you get to Harbor Lights?
- 15 minutes?

07:56.953 --> 08:00.263
Find out all you can about
the people who treated Max,

08:00.353 --> 08:03.072
see if they noticed
anything unusual about her.

08:03.153 --> 08:05.542
- I will.
- We can't risk that exposure.

08:05.633 --> 08:08.750
We can't let anyone tip to the fact
that she's different.

08:08.833 --> 08:12.030
I know the drill. I won't
let anything happen to her.

08:12.113 --> 08:14.104
All right. I'll see you there.

08:17.073 --> 08:21.783
Surgery came off without a hitch.
She should be up and running in a few days.

08:21.873 --> 08:24.785
- Any tests run?
- The usual. Haven't come back yet.

08:24.873 --> 08:29.628
- Should've had them back hours ago.
- This place. Yesterday we ran out of gloves.

08:29.713 --> 08:33.672
Gloves! You believe that?
That never happens at Crestview, though.

08:33.753 --> 08:35.903
- Thanks again, Colleen.
- No problem.

08:35.993 --> 08:40.783
Hey, listen, Sam. A word of advice:
Keep your distance when she wakes up.

08:40.873 --> 08:44.263
- Why's that?
- Girl's got a grip like a vice.

08:47.153 --> 08:49.826
- Thanks for the warning.
- No problem.

08:53.993 --> 08:55.790
Eastman, Eastman...

08:58.353 --> 09:01.948
- There you go. I was just about to get to it.
- Great.

09:02.033 --> 09:04.786
I'm gonna have it run at a private lab.

09:05.993 --> 09:08.143
No sweat off my back.

09:36.513 --> 09:39.789
Mrs Eastman, you really
shouldn't be out of bed.

09:39.873 --> 09:42.307
Oh... Sorry.

09:43.113 --> 09:43.393
- You have a visitor.
- I do?

09:43.393 --> 09:45.907
- You have a visitor.
- I do?

09:45.993 --> 09:48.632
Your husband's been waiting to see you.

09:51.873 --> 09:52.942
Hello, Linda.

09:55.353 --> 09:57.344
Hey, you.

09:57.433 --> 10:01.824
Visiting hours are over in a couple
of minutes. Try to keep it short.

10:05.353 --> 10:08.663
- Nice haircut.
- Nice gunshot wound.

10:10.993 --> 10:14.702
If I knew this was all it took
to get a visit from Logan Cale,

10:14.793 --> 10:17.830
I would've gotten my ass shot up a while ago.

10:23.633 --> 10:25.908
Brought you a change of clothes.

10:26.353 --> 10:28.344
Thanks.

10:39.873 --> 10:42.865
- So how you feeling?
- Like gettin' outta here.

10:44.113 --> 10:47.105
There's no need.
I got Sam Carr to take over your case.

10:47.193 --> 10:51.232
He's gonna look out for you.
Nobody'll be the wiser.

10:51.313 --> 10:56.148
- Why don't you lie down and relax?
- Yeah... OK.

10:56.233 --> 11:00.465
I guess it would be kind of weird if I just

11:00.553 --> 11:05.422
jumped up and left just a few hours
after I got slugged in the gut.

11:07.433 --> 11:13.030
How'd that happen, anyway? I thought
you were faster than a speeding bullet.

11:13.113 --> 11:14.831
I wish.

11:14.913 --> 11:20.192
I was trying to get this kid out of
the crossfire. Lost track of the shooter.

11:27.993 --> 11:30.985
- Guess you'd better get going.
- Yeah.

11:34.713 --> 11:37.273
If you don't mind,
I was gonna come by tomorrow

11:37.353 --> 11:40.550
just to check on you, see how you're doing.

11:41.553 --> 11:43.544
Yeah.

11:43.633 --> 11:45.749
I'd like that.

11:45.833 --> 11:47.232
OK.

11:49.873 --> 11:51.067
Bye.

11:51.513 --> 11:52.707
Bye.

12:11.873 --> 12:13.864
What the...?

12:21.073 --> 12:24.065
- This is not good.
- I ran it through the PCA.

12:24.153 --> 12:27.862
It came back as a match to that hantavirus
in LA a couple of years ago.

12:27.953 --> 12:31.548
But the protein structure's different.
Must be a mutated strain.

12:31.633 --> 12:34.705
- Is it virulent?
- Sure as hell looks it.

12:34.793 --> 12:38.581
The RNA's replicating like crazy.
Who's the patient?

12:39.593 --> 12:42.744
- Eastwood. L Eastwood.
- That can't be right. He was my patient.

12:42.833 --> 12:48.112
- I released him this morning.
- It says so right there. L Eastwood.

12:48.193 --> 12:49.353
- L Eastman. You mixed them up.
- Oh, my God.

12:49.353 --> 12:52.106
- L Eastman. You mixed them up.
- Oh, my God.

12:52.193 --> 12:54.582
CDC's gonna wanna know about this.

12:54.673 --> 12:57.187
We could be looking at LA all over again.

13:08.473 --> 13:11.624
- This better be important.
- It is, sir.

13:11.713 --> 13:13.465
All right. Hit me, Otto.

13:13.553 --> 13:17.671
Communications intercepted a call to
the CDC from Harbor Lights Medical.

13:17.753 --> 13:21.905
They're treating a patient
contaminated by an unidentified viral agent.

13:22.793 --> 13:26.263
The CDC dispatched a team
to assess the situation.

13:27.193 --> 13:29.991
And I should find this interesting because...?

13:30.073 --> 13:33.952
The patient's only distinguishing mark
was a tattoo on the back of her neck.

13:34.033 --> 13:37.662
A bar code, sir... It's 452.

13:50.433 --> 13:53.743
- Are you still there, sir?
- Still here, Otto.

13:53.833 --> 13:56.870
Assemble the team. We'll rendezvous in 20.

13:56.953 --> 13:58.352
Yes, sir.

14:14.513 --> 14:17.186
- Who are you?
- My name's Dr George.

14:17.273 --> 14:20.265
I'm with the Centers for Disease Control.

14:20.353 --> 14:23.743
- What are they doing here?
- Try to keep calm.

14:23.833 --> 14:27.508
It's just a precaution until we determine
the origin of your infection.

14:27.593 --> 14:28.708
My what?

14:28.793 --> 14:33.344
When you were brought in yesterday, your
blood was run through a special machine.

14:33.433 --> 14:37.711
It detected a virus in your system.
The hospital called us so we could help you.

14:37.793 --> 14:41.069
I'm not contagious.
You don't need any of this crap.

14:41.153 --> 14:44.190
- We just want to be sure.
- I am sure. I'm going home.

14:44.273 --> 14:49.427
We need to run some tests. I promise
we'll do all we can to keep you comfortable.

14:49.513 --> 14:52.550
As long as I'm a comfortable prisoner,
that's fine.

14:52.633 --> 14:55.101
We're sealed up. Ready to decontaminate.

14:56.393 --> 14:57.872
- Come on!
- Go ahead.

14:59.313 --> 15:04.671
I'm gonna have to check you for lesions,
scar tissue, anything out of the ordinary.

15:04.753 --> 15:07.745
- Nice try, perv.
- Mrs Eastman, please.

15:07.833 --> 15:10.513
- Don't make me put you in restraints.
- Out of my way now, or I'm countin' to three.

15:10.513 --> 15:12.265
- Don't make me put you in restraints.
- Out of my way now, or I'm countin' to three.

15:12.353 --> 15:14.662
You know what? No, I'm not.

15:14.753 --> 15:17.631
It's not good to exert yourself
so soon after surgery.

15:17.713 --> 15:19.544
- I'm fine.
- You're not fine.

15:19.633 --> 15:25.503
You've lost a great deal of blood.
If you're not careful, you just might faint.

15:57.553 --> 16:01.148
- This is gonna be a pissing contest.
- Sir?

16:01.233 --> 16:04.782
The CDCs will hardly hand her over
if they think she's a biohazard.

16:04.873 --> 16:08.149
- So what do we do now?
- Now?

16:09.713 --> 16:13.626
Well, now we go home,

16:13.713 --> 16:18.229
and we pray really, really hard
that she doesn't expose

16:18.313 --> 16:23.103
the massive government conspiracy
that we've been assigned to cover up.

16:23.193 --> 16:25.343
Sarcasm. Very good, sir.

16:28.153 --> 16:30.303
No visitors. Check in over there.

16:30.393 --> 16:32.543
Can I help you, sir?

16:32.633 --> 16:36.546
- Yeah, I'm here to see my wife.
- This facility's under CDC quarantine.

16:36.633 --> 16:39.466
- No one goes beyond this point.
- Did something happen?

16:39.553 --> 16:41.748
Lady on the sixth floor has a nasty bug.

16:41.833 --> 16:45.269
- The CDC's here to check it out.
- Bug? What kind of bug?

16:45.353 --> 16:48.106
- Can't let you through.
- Special Agent White. FBI.

16:48.193 --> 16:52.425
- I'm here for Linda Eastman.
- You'll have to talk to one of the CDC guys.

16:52.513 --> 16:56.904
What, are you slow? I'm FBI.
I don't need to talk to anybody.

16:58.153 --> 16:59.825
Out of the way, bub.

16:59.913 --> 17:03.349
I don't care who you are.
No one gets by without clearance.

17:03.433 --> 17:06.584
...and see if you can't get
a more specific match.

17:06.673 --> 17:09.506
- You in charge here?
- I am.

17:10.473 --> 17:12.464
Special Agent Ames White.

17:12.553 --> 17:16.785
I understand that you're treating
a Linda Eastman. Is that correct?

17:16.873 --> 17:20.229
- Correct. What's it to the FBI?
- She tops our most wanted list.

17:20.313 --> 17:24.021
- I need her ready for transport in 15 minutes.
- You're kidding.

17:24.113 --> 17:25.865
I wish I was.

17:25.953 --> 17:29.025
- What did she do?
- That information is classified.

17:29.113 --> 17:31.388
Classified or not,
she's not going anywhere.

17:31.473 --> 17:35.227
I don't think you understand.
I'm not asking you, I'm telling you.

17:35.313 --> 17:38.066
Tell me again.

17:38.153 --> 17:43.102
- This is a matter of national security.
- Until I know what I'm dealing with here,

17:43.193 --> 17:46.902
- I'm keeping her under quarantine.
- I am taking her, now.

17:46.993 --> 17:49.791
The public has a right
to know what's going on.

17:49.873 --> 17:53.104
Doctor, Channel Three News.
Can I get a statement?

17:53.193 --> 17:55.991
Smile, Mr White. You're on Candid Camera.

17:56.073 --> 17:58.587
What's the CDC doing at Harbor Lights?

17:59.633 --> 18:02.227
Unless you want me to tell that reporter

18:02.313 --> 18:07.023
that you're gonna override a CDC quarantine
and expose the public to a health threat,

18:07.113 --> 18:09.673
I think we're done here.

18:12.513 --> 18:13.866
Thought so.

18:33.793 --> 18:36.512
The CDC idiot won't turn her over.
Not willingly.

18:36.593 --> 18:38.902
- Has he figured out what she is yet?
- No.

18:38.993 --> 18:42.622
But it won't be long before
he figures out she's not a regular girl.

18:42.713 --> 18:47.787
If she decides she's got nothing to lose,
she could blow this whole thing wide open.

18:47.873 --> 18:52.469
We have to find a way to get to her,
terminate her before she does.

19:17.473 --> 19:20.112
Hey, Doc. Where's your body condom?

19:21.113 --> 19:23.104
Better hope I don't sneeze.

19:23.193 --> 19:27.391
Your test results just came in.
You're not contagious.

19:27.473 --> 19:30.067
Wow, told you that about a thousand times.

19:30.153 --> 19:33.907
We needed to take every precaution.
I hope you understand.

19:33.993 --> 19:36.826
Yeah. You know,
we could still be best friends.

19:36.913 --> 19:40.542
Why don't you take these off of me
and I can get the hell outta here?

19:40.633 --> 19:43.545
I'm afraid that won't be possible -
at least, not yet.

19:43.633 --> 19:46.705
Question: Did you pay
your malpractice insurance?

19:46.793 --> 19:51.344
I'd prefer a cash settlement
to taking your house and car.

19:51.433 --> 19:57.303
When we ran these tests, we made some
very interesting discoveries about your DNA.

19:59.273 --> 20:01.628
Why don't you look surprised?

20:01.713 --> 20:04.989
- What's wrong with my DNA?
- Nothing.

20:05.073 --> 20:09.510
These are some of the most amazing
samples of genetic material I've ever seen.

20:09.593 --> 20:13.063
Every single matched pair
coded with information.

20:13.153 --> 20:16.702
Not a single speck of junk DNA
in the entire batch.

20:17.073 --> 20:20.702
Could this have something to do with
your enhanced recuperative powers?

20:20.793 --> 20:23.990
So now you're keeping me here
because I'm too healthy.

20:24.073 --> 20:28.464
Would it surprise you to know
that there's a man from the FBI here?

20:28.553 --> 20:34.310
He seems to think you're a national security
threat. Wants me to turn you over to him.

20:35.433 --> 20:37.742
You can't do that.

20:37.833 --> 20:40.745
No, I don't intend to.

20:41.993 --> 20:44.985
I'm taking you to CDC headquarters.

20:45.073 --> 20:49.624
Gonna see if we can't figure out
the mystery of Linda Eastman.

20:49.993 --> 20:54.589
Hey, don't look so down.
Atlanta's very beautiful this time of year.

21:09.073 --> 21:11.064
Who's he talking to?

21:11.153 --> 21:12.825
I didn't ask.

21:13.833 --> 21:15.425
He didn't say.

21:23.473 --> 21:25.429
Come on, come on.

21:26.953 --> 21:27.942
Here we go.

21:28.033 --> 21:31.662
From our ancestors.
For our children's children.

21:31.753 --> 21:35.792
From my father before me. For my sons.

21:35.873 --> 21:38.262
Why have you called me?

21:38.353 --> 21:42.346
I need help. Do we have
a Familiar at Harbor Lights Hospital?

21:42.433 --> 21:46.062
- Elizabeth Blanchard, a nurse.
- I was hoping you'd say that.

21:46.153 --> 21:49.509
I'm always prepared to reciprocate.
You know how to reach me.

21:49.593 --> 21:51.788
We'll be in touch.

21:56.673 --> 21:58.186
Dammit!

22:04.233 --> 22:09.182
Mario, could you check on 604?
The guy's monitor's on the fritz again.

22:11.913 --> 22:13.869
Nurses' station.

22:14.833 --> 22:16.152
- Betty?
- Yeah?

22:16.233 --> 22:18.349
Line two.

22:19.953 --> 22:21.068
Yes?

22:21.153 --> 22:24.225
From my father before me.
For my sons.

22:24.313 --> 22:26.952
From my mother before me.
For my daughters.

22:27.753 --> 22:32.224
- A Familiar needs your help.
- I'm listening.

22:35.233 --> 22:36.222
There you go.

22:41.073 --> 22:44.304
You want me to kill her?

22:44.393 --> 22:46.384
Is that a problem for you?

22:47.593 --> 22:50.107
I could never refuse a Familiar.

22:51.313 --> 22:55.067
Very good. Contact me when it's done.

23:02.113 --> 23:04.388
Sue? Could you cover for me a minute?

23:04.473 --> 23:07.033
- Sure thing.
- Thanks.

23:51.833 --> 23:57.829
Hi there. Dr George wanted me to check
on you, see how his favourite patient's doing.

24:06.953 --> 24:08.466
There we go.

24:09.193 --> 24:10.751
What's that?

24:10.833 --> 24:14.303
This is just a little something
to help you sleep.

24:15.553 --> 24:20.183
I'd sleep fine if people would stop
coming in here every ten minutes.

24:20.273 --> 24:21.786
Doctor's orders.

24:37.673 --> 24:39.948
Come on, Max. Listen.

24:44.833 --> 24:47.301
Why is it doing that? I feel fine.

24:49.833 --> 24:52.586
Probably just a glitch.
Nothing to worry about.

24:52.673 --> 24:55.267
Maybe you should go check it out.

24:57.473 --> 24:59.907
White has

24:59.993 --> 25:03.542
someone inside.

25:06.753 --> 25:10.428
6326.

25:12.913 --> 25:16.826
Now, this might burn a little bit,
and then it's off to dreamland.

25:17.353 --> 25:20.743
You're in...

25:24.473 --> 25:26.065
Danger.

25:37.953 --> 25:40.228
- What are you doing?
- Suddenly I feel better.

25:40.313 --> 25:42.747
You still have to take your medicine.

25:45.793 --> 25:48.068
Transgenic filth.

25:48.153 --> 25:50.348
I was trying to make it painless for you.

25:50.433 --> 25:54.585
- Now it's going to hurt.
- You took the words right out of my mouth.

26:01.433 --> 26:05.745
Let me guess. You're one of
White's breeding-cult psychos.

26:08.273 --> 26:14.382
You'd think after ten generations of selective
reproduction you wouldn't have a fat ass.

26:37.393 --> 26:42.228
Is that supposed to hurt?
I don't feel pain. How about you?

27:19.433 --> 27:21.742
My God. She's alive.

27:22.793 --> 27:26.627
Stay with her. I'm gonna see
if Dr George is ready for some help.

27:26.713 --> 27:28.988
Let's get some help here!

27:52.553 --> 27:57.547
Let me see if I can get this straight.
She has been your patient for over a year.

27:57.633 --> 28:00.272
You noticed nothing unusual
about her blood work?

28:00.353 --> 28:04.028
She's only seen me twice -
once for a cold, once for the stomach flu.

28:04.113 --> 28:06.911
There was never any need for blood work.

28:16.113 --> 28:20.948
This is why you're harassing my patient?
You think she's a mutant?

28:21.033 --> 28:25.709
- Have you ever heard of Manticore, Doctor?
- Can't say that I have.

28:25.793 --> 28:30.389
Rumour has it Manticore was a covertly
funded genetic engineering facility.

28:30.473 --> 28:35.149
Grew babies in test tubes,
and trained them to be super-soldiers.

28:35.233 --> 28:40.023
With all due respect, I think maybe you've
seen one too many science fiction movies.

28:40.113 --> 28:43.389
Doctor? Linda Eastman's escaped.

28:47.993 --> 28:52.589
Dr Robert Houston to Admitting, please.
Dr Robert Houston to Admitting.

28:57.113 --> 29:01.106
Dr Phillips to Radiology, please.
Dr Phillips to Radiology.

29:59.313 --> 30:04.103
I thought we had her, but she's gone.
She couldn't have gone far.

30:09.433 --> 30:13.904
- Hello?
- Linda Eastman. I'm looking for my husband.

30:13.993 --> 30:17.349
- Are you all right?
- Been better.

30:17.433 --> 30:20.505
I take it that was you
on the other end of my EKG.

30:20.593 --> 30:25.189
- It was the best I could do on short notice.
- How'd you know she was coming after me?

30:25.273 --> 30:27.389
I hacked into White's cell.

30:27.473 --> 30:31.182
I heard him call in a favour from
one of his no-pain, no-gain freaks.

30:31.273 --> 30:33.264
Yeah, well, she's hurting now.

30:33.353 --> 30:36.789
Can you get me outta here
before White finds another way in?

30:36.873 --> 30:41.788
Yeah. I'm working on it, but
hospital security's got every exit blocked.

30:41.873 --> 30:44.148
- Dammit!
- What's wrong?

30:44.233 --> 30:48.272
That news team. Every time they broadcast,
it interferes with my signal.

30:48.353 --> 30:52.028
Got a feeling they're interfering
with your cell. I can barely hear you.

30:52.113 --> 30:54.183
I can't hear you either.

30:56.313 --> 30:58.986
Max, get to the roof, as fast as you can.

30:59.553 --> 31:01.464
Then what?

31:01.553 --> 31:04.625
The top floor is closed. It's totally abandoned.

31:04.713 --> 31:08.547
Shouldn't be any security up there.
I need you to get to the roof, Max.

31:08.633 --> 31:10.544
- Logan?
- Get to the roof.

31:10.633 --> 31:12.032
Logan?

31:13.833 --> 31:15.232
Max!

31:15.433 --> 31:16.832
Max?

31:22.073 --> 31:24.462
No sign of the subject.

31:49.233 --> 31:55.024
Hey. I need to get in touch with Artie McKeon,
does your traffic report. He's a friend of mine.

31:55.113 --> 31:57.308
Good for you. I'm busy.

31:58.873 --> 32:01.307
- Hey!
- It's an emergency.

33:09.233 --> 33:11.508
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

33:11.593 --> 33:15.905
Sorry, but we're under strict orders
to keep you in the confines of this facility.

33:15.993 --> 33:18.029
How strict?

33:18.113 --> 33:20.673
Please put your hands up.

33:26.313 --> 33:28.622
Wait! I'm on your side here.

33:30.553 --> 33:33.226
I killed them to protect us.

33:33.313 --> 33:38.103
Do you have any idea what would happen
if the CDC discovered what you really are?

33:38.193 --> 33:40.866
If they told the world what you really are?

33:40.953 --> 33:46.073
I got one for you: What if they find out
about your little "breeding programme"?

33:46.153 --> 33:48.792
I'm trying to help you, 452.

33:48.873 --> 33:52.946
Sure you are. That's why
you sent that nurse to kill me.

33:55.433 --> 33:59.426
I couldn't take the risk
that you might decide to talk.

33:59.993 --> 34:03.827
- It wasn't anything personal.
- That's good to know.

34:08.072 --> 34:10.223
I'm a practical man.

34:11.233 --> 34:13.030
And at this point,

34:13.112 --> 34:18.585
the only way to keep the CDC
from uncovering who you really are

34:18.672 --> 34:21.665
is to help you escape, alive.

34:22.672 --> 34:24.072
Yeah, right.

34:25.473 --> 34:27.384
Come on, 452.

34:28.393 --> 34:31.942
You're only making this
harder on the both of us.

34:32.553 --> 34:35.590
Someone might have heard those gunshots,

34:35.672 --> 34:39.063
and if they did, they'll be here any minute.

34:43.313 --> 34:47.704
Do you wanna go back into quarantine,
or do you wanna go home?

34:58.633 --> 35:00.589
I'm not gonna hurt you.

35:00.673 --> 35:05.872
Have you ever heard the expression
"my enemy's enemy is my friend"?

35:05.953 --> 35:10.822
Well, the CDC,
in their ill-fitting rubber suits,

35:10.913 --> 35:13.222
are your enemies.

35:13.313 --> 35:15.747
They're my enemies, too.

35:15.833 --> 35:18.825
So that makes me your friend.

35:21.273 --> 35:23.025
Come on, 452.

35:24.313 --> 35:29.387
I'll make you a deal.
I'll put my gun down, and you come out.

35:30.953 --> 35:33.103
Deal? Huh?

35:34.233 --> 35:40.069
I'll take that as a yes.
Qui tacet, consentire videtur.

35:41.073 --> 35:43.273
My pronunciation sucks, but that's Latin.

35:43.273 --> 35:44.183
My pronunciation sucks, but that's Latin.

35:45.193 --> 35:50.665
It means "he who is silent
is understood to consent."

35:50.753 --> 35:53.631
It's a legal term. I went to law school.

35:54.633 --> 35:56.828
I bet you didn't know that.

36:00.433 --> 36:02.628
See? We're sharing.

36:03.633 --> 36:06.466
We're getting to know one another.

36:07.793 --> 36:10.785
Now, I've held up my part of the bargain.

36:10.873 --> 36:13.512
I'd say it's time that you held up yours.

36:18.313 --> 36:21.510
Chop chop, 452. Time's a-wastin'.

37:32.273 --> 37:34.468
It's been fun, as always.

37:36.553 --> 37:38.305
Goodbye, 452.

38:10.913 --> 38:13.711
Max! Take my hand!

38:16.553 --> 38:18.623
Now, Max! Take my hand!

38:45.073 --> 38:48.668
- You OK?
- Not even close.

39:01.473 --> 39:03.828
- Better?
- Better. Thanks.

39:04.833 --> 39:08.542
I know you saved her, but couldn't you
bring her back in better condition?

39:08.633 --> 39:09.622
- C!
- What?

39:10.753 --> 39:15.827
You have a hole in your stomach, you got
a sprained ankle, a couple cracked ribs,

39:15.913 --> 39:19.189
not to mention the cuts and bruises
all over the damn place.

39:19.273 --> 39:23.824
Do me a favour. The CDC ever lock me
down in quarantine, leave me there.

39:25.113 --> 39:29.664
- Consider it done.
- Just so long as we understand each other.

39:29.753 --> 39:33.143
Hey, do we have any more of
that soup left? I'm kinda hungry.

39:33.233 --> 39:35.428
I'll go heat some up for you.

39:47.713 --> 39:51.228
Well, looks like you're in pretty good hands.

39:51.313 --> 39:52.507
Looks like.

39:56.193 --> 39:58.753
I got some Eyes Only stuff
to take care of, so...

39:58.833 --> 40:00.949
- Hey.
- What?

40:02.873 --> 40:06.752
Thanks for, you know...

40:12.633 --> 40:14.624
Yeah.

40:16.433 --> 40:18.583
Take care of yourself, Max.

40:39.953 --> 40:42.547
So things are still weird
between you and Logan.

40:42.633 --> 40:44.032
Yeah, I guess.

40:46.633 --> 40:50.626
Man still loves you, you know.
Risked his ass to save your life.

40:51.673 --> 40:52.662
Yeah.

40:54.953 --> 40:58.423
Wasn't for him, the CDC would
have hold of a real live transgenic.

40:58.513 --> 41:01.630
Now all they got's a few funky lab results.

41:01.713 --> 41:03.908
And a whole lot of questions.

41:04.953 --> 41:07.228
And they're gonna want answers.

41:07.313 --> 41:11.067
I got a feeling they won't
stop until they get them.

41:11.153 --> 41:14.111
We can't hide for ever.

41:14.193 --> 41:16.787
Sooner or later, we're gonna run outta luck.

41:20.193 --> 41:24.186
And I don't even wanna think
about what'll happen then.

42:35.993 --> 42:38.746
