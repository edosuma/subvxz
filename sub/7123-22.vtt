08:53.266 --> 08:54.255
Oh!

08:54.333 --> 08:55.994
[Breathing heavily]

08:56.068 --> 08:57.057
Wowzers!

08:57.136 --> 08:57.966
Aw, yeah!

08:58.037 --> 08:59.504
Run, blue piggy!

09:02.408 --> 09:03.397
[Panting]

09:03.476 --> 09:04.568
Take it easy, Wolfy!

09:04.644 --> 09:06.475
I just stomped grapes
on her tummy, all right?

09:06.546 --> 09:07.706
Aah!

09:07.780 --> 09:09.975
Bread balls! Bread balls!
Bread balls!

09:10.049 --> 09:11.846
[Panting]

09:11.918 --> 09:12.850
Eh?

09:12.919 --> 09:14.181
[Roars]

09:15.521 --> 09:16.920
Psych!

09:16.989 --> 09:18.718
Eat it, party puppy!

09:18.791 --> 09:20.019
[Chuckles]

09:20.092 --> 09:22.720
Face it, bro...
my divinity is unassailable!

09:22.795 --> 09:23.819
[Gasps]

09:23.896 --> 09:25.693
You should've stayed
out my business.

09:25.765 --> 09:28.290
She is not your "Bid-ness"!

09:30.036 --> 09:33.062
I can dodge your
"Zyaps" for days...

09:34.273 --> 09:35.103
Uh-oh.

09:36.208 --> 09:37.436
[Inhales sharply]

09:37.510 --> 09:39.535
Hmm.

09:39.612 --> 09:41.546
[As Party God]
Awooooo!

09:41.614 --> 09:42.512
Party God?

09:42.582 --> 09:43.981
Hey, girl.

09:44.050 --> 09:45.779
Did Ice King tell you
to come talk to me?

09:45.851 --> 09:47.716
Uh... maybe.

09:47.787 --> 09:48.913
Oh.

09:48.988 --> 09:51.582
So, is there something
you wanted to tell me?

09:51.657 --> 09:54.023
Uh... nope.
I'm good.

09:54.093 --> 09:57.551
Uh... uh, didn't you get some
good advice from a cool bro

09:57.630 --> 09:59.222
and you want to tell me
something important

09:59.298 --> 10:01.425
that will be difficult but
good for your future life in

10:01.500 --> 10:02.967
the long run?

10:03.035 --> 10:05.230
Well... yes.

10:05.304 --> 10:08.865
You're bad,
and I'm terminating our romance.

10:08.941 --> 10:10.272
Bam!

10:10.343 --> 10:11.810
Get out of my face.

10:11.877 --> 10:13.538
Wow. I would not have been able
to do that without the advice of

10:13.613 --> 10:16.776
my emotionally mature
friend Ice King.

10:16.849 --> 10:17.781
[Normal]
Huh?

10:17.850 --> 10:19.317
[As Party God]
Uh...

10:19.385 --> 10:22.411
Ice King wanted me to tell you
that he's gonna break up with

10:22.488 --> 10:24.080
his girlfriend, too.

10:24.156 --> 10:28.820
And that you were as much an
inspiration to him as he was to you,

10:28.894 --> 10:30.589
if not less so.

10:30.663 --> 10:32.790
Mm. That's nice.

10:32.865 --> 10:34.799
He says he'll be
sure to visit...

10:34.867 --> 10:36.858
I'm going to
outer space now!

10:36.936 --> 10:38.563
Oh, okay.

10:40.339 --> 10:42.239
Whew!

10:42.308 --> 10:43.707
Waah!

10:48.214 --> 10:49.272
Aah!

10:49.348 --> 10:50.315
Fun cakes!

10:50.383 --> 10:51.611
I've come to a decision.

10:51.684 --> 10:52.548
You ready to hear it?

10:52.618 --> 10:53.983
I'm breaking up with you!

10:54.053 --> 10:56.817
You party too much, you never
want to spend time with me,

10:56.889 --> 11:00.689
and you only care about having
fun and other people's stereos!

11:00.760 --> 11:04.628
I'm just a big island you can
come and go from as you please!

11:04.697 --> 11:05.721
Banana guards!

11:05.798 --> 11:07.823
Banana guards yourself,
Princess!

11:11.203 --> 11:12.500
Eh, we'll work it out.
