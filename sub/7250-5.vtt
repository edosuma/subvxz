I'M SORRY. DID I HEAR

05:54.353 --> 05:57.149
YOU MENTION SOMETHING

05:54.353 --> 05:57.149
ABOUT AN AUCTION?

05:57.191 --> 05:59.442
MY MOTHER'S WOMEN'S GROUP IS

05:57.191 --> 05:59.442
HAVING ONE NEXT WEEK.

05:59.484 --> 06:01.736
OH, WELL, YOU KNOW,

05:59.484 --> 06:01.736
I LOVE A GOOD AUCTION --

06:01.778 --> 06:03.197
THE DRAMA, THE STRATEGY.

06:03.238 --> 06:04.739
STRATEGY?

06:03.238 --> 06:04.739
OH, YES.

06:04.781 --> 06:06.533
FIRST, YOU MUSTN'T

06:04.781 --> 06:06.533
BE TOO EAGER,

06:06.574 --> 06:08.327
BECAUSE THAT DRIVES

06:06.574 --> 06:08.327
THE PRICE WAY UP.

06:08.367 --> 06:09.995
DON'T BE TOO EAGER --

06:08.367 --> 06:09.995
GOT IT.

06:10.037 --> 06:13.957
YOU MUST ALWAYS BE EXTREMELY

06:10.037 --> 06:13.957
CAREFUL OF YOUR PADDLE MOVEMENT.

06:13.999 --> 06:15.834
WELL, THAT CERTAINLY CALLS

06:13.999 --> 06:15.834
FOR A "DIRTY."

06:15.876 --> 06:18.628
HOW'S YOUR ARM RAISE, GOOD?

06:15.876 --> 06:18.628
PRETTY GOOD.

06:18.670 --> 06:20.630
I HAVE AN EXCELLENT

06:18.670 --> 06:20.630
ARM RAISE.

06:20.672 --> 06:22.674
THAT'S WHAT IT SAYS

06:20.672 --> 06:22.674
ON THE BATHROOM WALL.

06:22.716 --> 06:25.468
YES, WELL,

06:22.716 --> 06:25.468
IF YOU NEED SOME TIPS...

06:25.510 --> 06:28.013
I'LL GIVE YOU A CALL.

06:25.510 --> 06:28.013
GOOD.

06:28.055 --> 06:30.015
TAKE ME TO THE AUCTION!

06:28.055 --> 06:30.015
MICHEL.

06:30.057 --> 06:33.852
TAKE ME! I INSIST YOU TAKE ME.

06:30.057 --> 06:33.852
YOU DON'T KNOW IF

06:30.057 --> 06:33.852
IT'S GONNA BE GOOD.

06:33.894 --> 06:35.436
IT'S A BUNCH

06:33.894 --> 06:35.436
OF SOCIETY WOMEN.

06:35.478 --> 06:37.480
IF YOUR MOTHER'S INVOLVED,

06:35.478 --> 06:37.480
IT WILL BE IMPECCABLE.

06:37.522 --> 06:39.774
I HAVEN'T BEEN TO

06:37.522 --> 06:39.774
ONE IN OVER A YEAR.

06:39.816 --> 06:42.069
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.

06:39.816 --> 06:42.069
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

06:42.110 --> 06:45.655
I DON'T WANT ANYTHING.

06:42.110 --> 06:45.655
STOP PLAYING COY WITH ME.

06:42.110 --> 06:45.655
I WANT INTO THAT AUCTION.

06:45.697 --> 06:49.034
YOU NAME YOUR PRICE.

06:45.697 --> 06:49.034
OKAY. YOU HAVE TO WORK

06:45.697 --> 06:49.034

06:49.076 --> 06:51.452
DONE.

AND YOU HAVE TO

06:49.076 --> 06:51.452
ANSWER THE PHONE.

06:51.494 --> 06:53.788
DONE.

06:51.494 --> 06:53.788
AND YOU HAVE TO

06:51.494 --> 06:53.788
ANSWER IT IN ENGLISH

06:53.830 --> 06:55.665
UNLESS THE PERSON

06:53.830 --> 06:55.665
IS ACTUALLY FOREIGN.

06:55.707 --> 06:58.752
DONE.

06:55.707 --> 06:58.752
AND YOU HAVE TO OVERSEE

06:55.707 --> 06:58.752
THE NATURE HIKERS NEXT WEEK.

06:58.793 --> 07:01.880
NO.

06:58.793 --> 07:01.880
MICHEL, IF YOU WANT

06:58.793 --> 07:01.880
TO GO TO THIS AUCTION,

07:01.922 --> 07:04.966
YOU HAVE TO BE IN THE LOBBY

07:01.922 --> 07:04.966

07:05.008 --> 07:07.261
YOU HAVE TO HAND OUT TOWELS

07:05.008 --> 07:07.261
AND WATER BOTTLES.

07:07.302 --> 07:11.348
YOU HAVE TO SHOW THEM THE

07:07.302 --> 07:11.348
HIKING TRAILS, AND LET THEM

07:07.302 --> 07:11.348
GIVE YOU A NATURE NAME.

07:11.390 --> 07:13.892
FINE. I WILL LET THEM

07:11.390 --> 07:13.892
GIVE ME A NATURE NAME.

07:13.934 --> 07:16.728
ALRIGHT, THEN,

07:13.934 --> 07:16.728
YOU CAN COME.

07:13.934 --> 07:16.728
THANK YOU.

07:16.770 --> 07:19.522
BUTTERCUP.

07:16.770 --> 07:19.522
YOU CANNOT GIVE THEM

07:16.770 --> 07:19.522
SUGGESTIONS!

07:21.316 --> 07:24.319
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU GOT INTO

07:21.316 --> 07:24.319
A FIGHT WITH PETE.

07:24.361 --> 07:27.655
YOU DO NOT SUDDENLY DECIDE THAT

07:24.361 --> 07:27.655
GARLIC IS AN EXTRA TOPPING --

07:27.697 --> 07:30.200
NOT AFTER FIVE YEARS, NOT

07:27.697 --> 07:30.200
AFTER ALL WE'VE BEEN THROUGH.

07:30.242 --> 07:32.744
WE SINGLE-HANDEDLY HELPED PETE

07:30.242 --> 07:32.744
PAY FOR THAT NEW DELIVERY TRUCK,

07:32.786 --> 07:35.038
I THOUGHT HE NEEDED

07:32.786 --> 07:35.038
TO BE REMINDED OF THAT.

07:35.080 --> 07:36.915
VERY LOUDLY.

07:35.080 --> 07:36.915
NOT THAT LOUDLY.

07:36.957 --> 07:39.459
DOGS STARTED BARKING.

07:36.957 --> 07:39.459
BECAUSE THEY HEARD ABOUT

07:36.957 --> 07:39.459
THE GARLIC INCIDENT.

07:39.500 --> 07:42.296
NO ONE LIKES GETTING SCREWED.

07:39.500 --> 07:42.296
PETE'S A SWINDLER.

07:42.337 --> 07:44.047
HE TAKES ADVANTAGE OF

07:42.337 --> 07:44.047
SINGLE MOTHERS

07:44.089 --> 07:46.591
AND THEIR INNOCENT CHILDREN,

07:44.089 --> 07:46.591
AND FOR THAT, HE MUST PAY.

07:46.633 --> 07:48.218
HE GAVE US

07:46.633 --> 07:48.218
FREE CHEESY BREAD.

07:48.260 --> 07:50.095
HE DID?

07:50.137 --> 07:51.471
OH.

07:50.137 --> 07:51.471
YEAH.

07:51.512 --> 07:53.765
I LOVE THE CHEESY BREAD.

07:51.512 --> 07:53.765
I KNOW YOU DO.

07:53.807 --> 07:56.810
IT'S ALL HOT, TOO.

07:53.807 --> 07:56.810
NOW, DOESN'T SOMEONE FEEL

07:53.807 --> 07:56.810
A LITTLE SILLY?

07:56.851 --> 07:58.812
ME?

07:56.851 --> 07:58.812
SHOULD WE CALL PETE TONIGHT?

07:58.853 --> 08:00.021
OKAY --

07:58.853 --> 08:00.021
AFTER CHEESY BREAD.

08:00.063 --> 08:01.440
FINE, AFTER

08:00.063 --> 08:01.440
THE CHEESY BREAD.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.483
I'M GONNA GO GET THE MAIL.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.483
GO INSIDE.

08:03.524 --> 08:06.527
I'M GONNA GO MELT

08:03.524 --> 08:06.527
SOME MORE CHEESE ON THE PIZZA.

08:03.524 --> 08:06.527
MELT AWAY.

08:07.904 --> 08:10.115
HEY!

08:07.904 --> 08:10.115
HELLO THERE, NEIGHBOR!

08:10.157 --> 08:12.117
HI. I'M SORRY,

08:10.157 --> 08:12.117
ARE WE NEIGHBORS?

08:12.159 --> 08:14.953
YES. YES, WE ARE.

08:12.159 --> 08:14.953
I JUST MOVED IN ACROSS THE WAY.

08:14.995 --> 08:17.705
OH! OH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

08:14.995 --> 08:17.705
BEENIE MORRISON'S OLD PLACE.

08:17.747 --> 08:20.917
THAT'S RIGHT.

08:17.747 --> 08:20.917
BEENIE MORRISON'S OLD PLACE.

08:20.959 --> 08:23.462
I LIVE IN BEENIE MORRISON'S

08:20.959 --> 08:23.462
OLD PLACE. ISN'T THAT GREAT?!

08:23.503 --> 08:26.006
ONLY IF BEENIE MORRISON DIDN'T

08:23.503 --> 08:26.006
WANT TO LIVE THERE ANYMORE.

08:26.047 --> 08:30.093
OH, NO. I PAID HIM A VERY GOOD

08:26.047 --> 08:30.093
PRICE -- OVERPAID, ACTUALLY.

08:26.047 --> 08:30.093
BUT IT WAS WORTH IT.

08:30.135 --> 08:32.387
I'VE BEEN DREAMING ABOUT A PLACE

08:30.135 --> 08:32.387
LIKE BEENIE MORRISON'S.

08:32.429 --> 08:36.266
FOR A<i> LONG</i> TIME,

08:32.429 --> 08:36.266
AND THEN I FOUND IT.

08:36.308 --> 08:39.019
I'M SORRY.

08:36.308 --> 08:39.019
I'M JUST REALLY EXCITED.

08:36.308 --> 08:39.019
THAT'S OKAY. IT'S NICE.

08:39.060 --> 08:40.812
IT'S A GREAT NEIGHBORHOOD.

08:39.060 --> 08:40.812
YES, IT IS.

08:40.854 --> 08:43.190
EVERYONE'S SO FRIENDLY.

08:40.854 --> 08:43.190
BABETTE -- DO YOU KNOW BABETTE?

08:43.231 --> 08:45.984
EVERYBODY KNOWS BABETTE.

08:43.231 --> 08:45.984
OH, SHE'S A GREAT LADY.

08:46.026 --> 08:50.071
OH, UH, ANYHOW, I'M DWIGHT.

08:46.026 --> 08:50.071
I'M LORELAI, AND IF YOU SEE

08:46.026 --> 08:50.071
A TEEN WALKING AROUND

08:50.113 --> 08:52.615
WITH A HALO AND A BOOK,

08:50.113 --> 08:52.615
THAT'S MY DAUGHTER, RORY.

08:52.657 --> 08:56.703
VERY NICE TO MEET YOU, LORELAI.

08:52.657 --> 08:56.703
NICE TO MEET YOU, TOO, DWIGHT.

08:52.657 --> 08:56.703
WELCOME TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

08:56.744 --> 08:59.831
IF THERE'S ANYTHING I CAN DO

08:56.744 --> 08:59.831
TO HELP OUT, LET ME KNOW.

08:59.873 --> 09:02.042
REALLY?

08:59.873 --> 09:02.042
SURE.

09:02.083 --> 09:03.668
WELL, THAT'S GREAT.

09:03.710 --> 09:06.296
ACTUALLY, I HAVE THIS LITTLE

09:03.710 --> 09:06.296
FAVOR I'D LOVE TO ASK.

09:06.338 --> 09:07.630
OH. RIGHT NOW?

09:07.672 --> 09:09.132
WELL, THIS WEEK.

09:09.174 --> 09:11.843
I JUST GOT THIS

09:09.174 --> 09:11.843
BEAUTIFUL LAWN PUT IN --

09:11.885 --> 09:15.222
REALLY AMAZING SHADE OF GREEN,

09:11.885 --> 09:15.222
THE GUY WHO PUT IT IN FOR ME,

09:15.263 --> 09:18.350
HE TOLD ME THAT I HAVE TO KEEP

09:15.263 --> 09:18.350
EACH BLADE OF GRASS

09:18.392 --> 09:21.686
VERY MOIST FOR THE FIRST FEW

09:18.392 --> 09:21.686
DAYS WHILE THE ROOTS TAKE,

09:21.728 --> 09:25.023
BUT I HAVE TO GO ON A BUSINESS

09:21.728 --> 09:25.023
TRIP FOR A FEW DAYS --

09:25.065 --> 09:27.484
LAST MINUTE,

09:25.065 --> 09:27.484
I TRIED TO GET OUT OF IT,

09:27.526 --> 09:29.903
BUT MY BOSS SAID,

09:27.526 --> 09:29.903
"DWIGHT, GET OFF YOUR KEISTER

09:29.944 --> 09:32.739
AND GO MAKE US SOME MONEY,"

09:29.944 --> 09:32.739
SO I GOTTA GO.

09:32.780 --> 09:35.283
WHEN "KEISTER'S" BEING THROWN

09:32.780 --> 09:35.283
AROUND, WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

09:35.325 --> 09:39.746
EXACTLY. SO I WAS WONDERING IF

09:35.325 --> 09:39.746
MAYBE YOU COULD WATER MY LAWN.

09:39.787 --> 09:43.333
OH.

09:39.787 --> 09:43.333
ONLY FOR A FEW DAYS -- YOU KNOW,

09:39.787 --> 09:43.333
A LITTLE IN THE MORNING,

09:43.375 --> 09:45.502
A LITTLE IN THE LATE

09:43.375 --> 09:45.502
AFTERNOON OR EVENING.

09:45.544 --> 09:48.463
DEPENDING ON YOUR SCHEDULE.

09:45.544 --> 09:48.463
IT WOULD BE A REALLY BIG FAVOR.

09:48.505 --> 09:53.009
UH, WELL, I...GUESS I-I COULD

09:48.505 --> 09:53.009
WATER YOUR LAWN, DWIGHT.

09:53.051 --> 09:55.554
SURE.

09:53.051 --> 09:55.554
BOY. THAT IS SOMETHING.

09:55.595 --> 09:59.391
IF I WOULD'VE ASKED SOMEBODY

09:55.595 --> 09:59.391
BACK WHERE I USED TO LIVE

09:55.595 --> 09:59.391
TO WATER MY LAWN

09:59.433 --> 10:02.310
I WOULD'VE GOTTEN A MUCH MORE

09:59.433 --> 10:02.310
"HBO" KIND OF ANSWER.

10:02.352 --> 10:05.439
I LOVE IT HERE!

10:02.352 --> 10:05.439
SO, CAN YOU COME ON OVER NOW?

10:05.480 --> 10:08.525
EXCUSE ME?

10:05.480 --> 10:08.525
SO I CAN SHOW YOU WHERE

10:05.480 --> 10:08.525
THE ON-OFF NOZZLE IS.

10:08.567 --> 10:11.486
IT'LL ONLY TAKE A SECOND.

10:08.567 --> 10:11.486
MY DAUGHTER'S WAITING

10:08.567 --> 10:11.486
INSIDE FOR ME.

10:11.528 --> 10:13.988
WELL, WE CAN DO IT

10:11.528 --> 10:13.988
TOMORROW BEFORE I LEAVE.

10:14.030 --> 10:15.532
GREAT.

10:14.030 --> 10:15.532
WHAT TIME ARE YOU LEAVING?

10:15.574 --> 10:17.409
6:00 A.M.

10:15.574 --> 10:17.409
NOW SOUNDS FINE.

10:17.451 --> 10:19.411
THAT'S SO TERRIFIC.

10:17.451 --> 10:19.411
UH, FOLLOW ME.

10:19.453 --> 10:20.995
OKAY.

10:23.081 --> 10:26.334
WE'RE JUST GONNA GO OVER HERE...

10:23.081 --> 10:26.334
OH, YEAH, I KNOW WHERE IT IS.

10:27.586 --> 10:29.379
WELCOME TO THE OASIS!

10:29.421 --> 10:31.965
THAT'S WHAT I NAMED THIS

10:29.421 --> 10:31.965
PLACE -- THE OASIS.<i> MY</i> OASIS.

10:32.006 --> 10:34.675
A LITTLE SLICE OF HEAVEN

10:32.006 --> 10:34.675
RIGHT HERE ON EARTH.

10:34.717 --> 10:38.638
GOSH, I SWEAR I STILL CAN'T

10:34.717 --> 10:38.638
BELIEVE I'M HERE.

10:38.679 --> 10:41.682
I WAS IN A TERRIBLE MARRIAGE,

10:38.679 --> 10:41.682
YOU KNOW.

10:38.679 --> 10:41.682
ACTUALLY, I DIDN'T.

10:41.724 --> 10:44.018
HORRIBLE -- LIKE A PUNISHMENT

10:41.724 --> 10:44.018
OUT OF GREEK MYTHOLOGY.

10:44.060 --> 10:46.563
THE WOMAN HAD FIVE HEADS --

10:44.060 --> 10:46.563
SUFFERING, AGONY.

10:46.605 --> 10:48.898
I USED TO BE TALLER.

10:46.605 --> 10:48.898
REALLY? SHE SHRUNK YOU?

10:48.940 --> 10:51.692
I USED TO HAVE MORE HAIR, TOO,

10:48.940 --> 10:51.692
AND HIGHER ARCHES.

10:48.940 --> 10:51.692
WELL.

10:51.734 --> 10:55.029
BUT THROUGH ALL THE SCREAMING

10:51.734 --> 10:55.029
AND THE NAME-CALLING,

10:55.071 --> 10:58.866
THE BERATING AND THE

10:55.071 --> 10:58.866
HUMILIATION, SOMEWHERE

10:55.071 --> 10:58.866
IN THE BACK OF MY MIND,

10:58.908 --> 11:01.786
I KNEW SOMEDAY I WOULD

10:58.908 --> 11:01.786
HAVE IT -- MY OASIS.

11:01.828 --> 11:03.704
[ CHUCKLES ]

11:01.828 --> 11:03.704
THAT'S WHAT GOT ME THROUGH.

11:03.746 --> 11:06.791
THAT'S WHAT KEPT ME FROM

11:03.746 --> 11:06.791
STICKING MY HEAD THROUGH

11:03.746 --> 11:06.791
A PLATE-GLASS WINDOW

11:06.833 --> 11:11.212
EVERY NIGHT WHEN I GOT HOME.

11:06.833 --> 11:11.212
WELL, THAT'S A REALLY...NICE...

11:06.833 --> 11:11.212
STORY, DWIGHT.

11:11.254 --> 11:12.964
IT'S VERY INSPIRING

11:11.254 --> 11:12.964
AND --

11:13.006 --> 11:16.468
OH, HEY! THIS LOOKS LIKE

16:56.975 --> 16:59.185
HE MUST HAVE BEEN CUTE.

16:59.226 --> 17:01.228
AND WITTY. YOU DON'T

16:59.226 --> 17:01.228
MEET THAT EVERY DAY.

17:01.270 --> 17:03.272
YOU KNOW WHO WOULD

17:01.270 --> 17:03.272
HAVE HIS NAME? GRANDMA.

17:03.314 --> 17:05.566
SHE ONLY KNOWS THE BIDDIES,

17:03.314 --> 17:05.566
NOT THE YOUNG ONES.

17:05.608 --> 17:07.902
SHE KNOWS EVERYONE

17:05.608 --> 17:07.902
AT THESE KINDS OF THINGS.

17:07.944 --> 17:10.446
I CANNOT ASK HER FOR THIS.

17:07.944 --> 17:10.446
THEN KISS SHAMU GOODBYE.

17:10.488 --> 17:12.114
BUT MAYBE

17:10.488 --> 17:12.114
<i>YOU</i> COULD ASK HER.

17:12.156 --> 17:14.701
WHAT?

17:12.156 --> 17:14.701
COME ON, ASK HER.

17:12.156 --> 17:14.701
DO ME A FAVOR.

17:14.742 --> 17:19.330
YOU WANT ME TO ASK THE NAME OF A

17:14.742 --> 17:19.330
MAN I DIDN'T MEET AT A FUNCTION?

17:19.372 --> 17:22.166
I'LL SHARE MY LOTTERY

17:19.372 --> 17:22.166
WINNINGS WITH YOU.

17:19.372 --> 17:22.166
IT'S RIDICULOUSLY TRANSPARENT.

17:22.208 --> 17:25.670
$14 MILLION.

17:22.208 --> 17:25.670
YOU'RE SHARING HALF WITH HIM,

17:22.208 --> 17:25.670
TAXES WILL TAKE A HUGE CHUNK,

17:25.712 --> 17:27.338
AND -- YOU DIDN'T

17:25.712 --> 17:27.338
WIN THE LOTTERY.

17:27.380 --> 17:29.632
ASK HER YOURSELF.

17:27.380 --> 17:29.632
YOU'RE MEAN!

17:29.674 --> 17:32.134
DID YOU CALL INFORMATION

17:29.674 --> 17:32.134
AND ASK FOR PADDLE 17's LISTING?

17:33.594 --> 17:35.930
WHAT DO YOU THINK

17:33.594 --> 17:35.930
OF THE PORK? RORY?

17:35.972 --> 17:37.223
IT'S GOOD.

17:37.264 --> 17:38.349
I'M NOT SURE.

17:37.264 --> 17:38.349
RICHARD?

17:38.391 --> 17:40.810
IT'S FINE.

17:38.391 --> 17:40.810
I'M NOT SURE.

17:40.852 --> 17:43.312
IT'S REALLY GOOD, MOM.

17:40.852 --> 17:43.312
YES, WELL, I'M NOT SURE.

17:43.354 --> 17:46.983
PORK IS BRED LEANER THESE DAYS.

17:43.354 --> 17:46.983
IT HAS A DIFFERENT TASTE.

17:47.025 --> 17:49.443
LESS FAT EQUALS LESS FLAVOR.

17:49.485 --> 17:52.279
YET ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE GREAT

17:49.485 --> 17:52.279
ADVANCES MAN HAS MADE --

17:52.321 --> 17:53.740
FLAVORLESS PORK.

17:53.781 --> 17:55.742
HURRAH

17:53.781 --> 17:55.742
FOR THE OPPOSABLE THUMBS.

17:55.783 --> 17:58.285
ENOUGH TALK ABOUT PORK. PLEASE,

17:55.783 --> 17:58.285
SOMEONE CHANGE THE SUBJECT.

17:58.327 --> 18:01.455
MOM HAD A REALLY GOOD TIME

17:58.327 --> 18:01.455
AT THE AUCTION THE OTHER DAY.

18:01.497 --> 18:03.457
DID YOU?

18:01.497 --> 18:03.457
YES. YES, I DID.

18:03.499 --> 18:05.501
I'M GLAD.

18:03.499 --> 18:05.501
DID YOU SEE ANYTHING YOU LIKED?

18:05.543 --> 18:07.837
YEAH, MOM.

18:05.543 --> 18:07.837
ANYTHING LOOK GOOD TO YOU THERE?

18:07.879 --> 18:11.131
YES, ACTUALLY, I BOUGHT A COUPLE

18:07.879 --> 18:11.131
OF END TABLES FOR THE INN.

18:11.173 --> 18:13.426
I WAS VERY IMPRESSED

18:11.173 --> 18:13.426
WITH THE SELECTION THIS YEAR.

18:13.467 --> 18:16.220
I EVEN WOUND UP PURCHASING

18:13.467 --> 18:16.220
A COUPLE OF PIECES FOR MYSELF.

18:16.262 --> 18:19.473
YES. HOW NICE TO HAVE YET

18:16.262 --> 18:19.473
ANOTHER CHAIR YOU CAN'T SIT IN.

18:19.515 --> 18:21.183
IT'S 100-YEARS-OLD.

18:21.225 --> 18:23.019
WE CAN PUT IT

18:21.225 --> 18:23.019
NEXT TO THE

18:23.061 --> 18:25.271
200-YEAR-OLD FOOTSTOOL

18:23.061 --> 18:25.271
YOU CAN'T PUT YOUR FOOT ON.

18:25.312 --> 18:27.356
RICHARD, PLEASE.

18:25.312 --> 18:27.356
I'M ONLY TEASING.

18:27.398 --> 18:29.358
IT'S A GREAT PLEASURE TO BE ABLE

18:29.400 --> 18:32.236
TO SURROUND YOU WITH A HOUSE

18:29.400 --> 18:32.236
FULL OF USELESS OBJECTS.

18:32.278 --> 18:36.866
NO, I-I'M NEVER HAPPIER

18:32.278 --> 18:36.866
THAN WHEN WE'RE STANDING IN THE

18:32.278 --> 18:36.866
CORNER STARING AT OUR FURNITURE.

18:36.908 --> 18:40.244
EAT YOUR PORK, PLEASE.

18:36.908 --> 18:40.244
I BELIEVE THERE WAS SOMETHING

18:36.908 --> 18:40.244
AT THE AUCTION

18:40.286 --> 18:44.415
THAT MOM WANTED,

18:40.286 --> 18:44.415
BUT SHE DIDN'T GET.

18:40.286 --> 18:44.415
OH, REALLY? WHAT WAS THAT?

18:44.457 --> 18:48.544
GUESS IT WAS A STEAMER TRUNK

18:44.457 --> 18:48.544
FOR RORY TO TAKE WITH HER TO

18:44.457 --> 18:48.544
MILITARY SCHOOL, RIGHT?

18:48.586 --> 18:53.340
I DON'T REMEMBER IT, BUT I CAN

18:48.586 --> 18:53.340
CHECK ON IT FOR YOU IF YOU LIKE.

18:48.586 --> 18:53.340
THAT'S NOT NECESSARY, MOM.

18:56.176 --> 18:59.973
SO, MOM, IT WAS A VERY NICE

18:56.176 --> 18:59.973
BUNCH OF PEOPLE YOU

18:56.176 --> 18:59.973
HAD AT THAT AUCTION.

19:00.014 --> 19:01.641
YES, VERY NICE.

19:01.682 --> 19:04.727
I WAS SURPRISED AT HOW MANY

19:01.682 --> 19:04.727
YOUNG PEOPLE WERE THERE.

19:04.769 --> 19:07.730
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,

19:04.769 --> 19:07.730
YOUNGER PEOPLE.

19:07.772 --> 19:09.440
UM, IN FACT, LIKE,

19:07.772 --> 19:09.440
FOR INSTANCE,

19:09.482 --> 19:13.611
THIS GUY THAT I TALKED TO FOR

19:09.482 --> 19:13.611
QUITE A WHILE. HE WAS...YOUNGER.

19:13.653 --> 19:17.448
WHAT MAN WAS THAT?

19:13.653 --> 19:17.448
I DIDN'T GET HIS NAME,

19:13.653 --> 19:17.448
BUT HE WAS A NICE-LOOKING GUY.

19:17.490 --> 19:21.243
HE HAD A GRAY SUIT,

19:17.490 --> 19:21.243
AND HE WAS PADDLE NUMBER 17.

19:17.490 --> 19:21.243
HE LIKES MERLOT.

19:21.285 --> 19:22.870
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT

19:21.285 --> 19:22.870
PEYTON SANDERS?

19:22.912 --> 19:23.955
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE.

19:23.997 --> 19:25.748
WAIT ONE SECOND.

19:23.997 --> 19:25.748
I'LL LOOK IT UP.

19:25.790 --> 19:27.834
OH, NO, MOM.

19:25.790 --> 19:27.834
YOU DON'T HAVE TO --

19:27.875 --> 19:30.086
SHE'S LOOKING IT UP.

19:30.128 --> 19:32.296
PADDLE NUMBER 17 --

19:30.128 --> 19:32.296
PEYTON SANDERS.

19:32.338 --> 19:34.423
OH, GREAT.

19:32.338 --> 19:34.423
OH, PEYTON SANDERS.

19:34.465 --> 19:36.342
WELL, THAT'S GREAT

19:34.465 --> 19:36.342
THAT IT'S PEYTON SANDERS

19:36.383 --> 19:41.430
BECAUSE THAT'S...UH...GREAT.

19:36.383 --> 19:41.430
HOW WELL DO YOU KNOW

19:36.383 --> 19:41.430
THIS PEYTON SANDERS?

19:41.472 --> 19:44.892
WHY DO YOU WANT TO KNOW

19:41.472 --> 19:44.892
HOW WELL I KNOW PEYTON SANDERS?

19:41.472 --> 19:44.892
WHAT?

19:44.934 --> 19:48.938
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW.

19:44.934 --> 19:48.938
I WAS JUST MENTIONING THAT

19:44.934 --> 19:48.938
HE WAS, YOU KNOW, SEEMED --

19:48.980 --> 19:51.565
YOUNG.

19:48.980 --> 19:51.565
YES, YOUNG.

19:51.607 --> 19:54.527
OKAY, MOM, UH, PEYTON AND I

19:51.607 --> 19:54.527
KIND OF HIT IT OFF,

19:54.568 --> 19:58.572
AND I WONDERED IF...

19:54.568 --> 19:58.572
YOU POSSIBLY HAD HIS NUMBER.

19:58.614 --> 20:01.241
OKAY, THERE, I SAID IT.

19:58.614 --> 20:01.241
PASS THE FLAVORLESS PORK.

20:01.283 --> 20:04.787
YOU'RE ASKING ME

20:01.283 --> 20:04.787
FOR HIS NUMBER.

20:01.283 --> 20:04.787
IF IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL, YES.

20:04.829 --> 20:09.042
WELL, WELL, WELL.

20:04.829 --> 20:09.042
RICHARD, LORELAI'S ASKING

20:04.829 --> 20:09.042
<i>ME FOR A MAN'S NUMBER.</i>

20:09.083 --> 20:11.752
SO I HEARD.

20:09.083 --> 20:11.752
IF IT'S A BIG DEAL,

20:09.083 --> 20:11.752
FORGET IT.

20:11.794 --> 20:15.589
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL AT ALL.

20:11.794 --> 20:15.589
I DON'T HAVE HIS NUMBER.

20:11.794 --> 20:15.589
OKAY. NEVER MIND.

20:15.631 --> 20:19.093
I CAN<i> GET</i> HIS NUMBER.

20:15.631 --> 20:19.093
YOU WANT ME TO?

20:15.631 --> 20:19.093
IT'S UP TO YOU.

20:19.135 --> 20:22.388
<i>I</i> DIDN'T ASK FOR HIS NUMBER.

20:19.135 --> 20:22.388
<i>YOU</i> ASKED FOR HIS NUMBER.

20:22.429 --> 20:24.807
THEREFORE,

20:22.429 --> 20:24.807
IT HAS TO BE UP TO<i> YOU.</i>

20:24.849 --> 20:27.018
OKAY, MOM.

20:24.849 --> 20:27.018
DO YOU WANT HIS NUMBER?

20:27.060 --> 20:29.353
IF YOU DON'T MIND.

20:27.060 --> 20:29.353
I DON'T MIND AT ALL.

20:29.395 --> 20:32.023
THANK YOU.

20:29.395 --> 20:32.023
YOU'RE WELCOME.

20:32.065 --> 20:34.233
I WASN'T KIDDING ABOUT

20:32.065 --> 20:34.233
THAT MILITARY SCHOOL.

20:36.485 --> 20:39.530
IF WE HURRY, WE STILL

20:36.485 --> 20:39.530
HAVE TIME TO HIT LUKE'S

20:36.485 --> 20:39.530
FOR BREAKFAST.

20:39.572 --> 20:41.323
WHAT DID I FORGET?

20:39.572 --> 20:41.323
PANTS.

20:41.365 --> 20:42.616
DON'T DO THAT.

20:41.365 --> 20:42.616
LET'S GO.

20:42.658 --> 20:44.618
I CAN'T.

20:42.658 --> 20:44.618
YOU GOTTA HAVE BREAKFAST.

20:44.660 --> 20:47.955
THE CLOCK IS WRONG.

20:44.660 --> 20:47.955
I'LL MISS MY BUS.

20:44.660 --> 20:47.955
I'LL DRIVE YOU TO SCHOOL.

20:47.997 --> 20:50.041
YOU WILL?

20:47.997 --> 20:50.041
YES. OH, SHOOT!

20:47.997 --> 20:50.041
DWIGHT'S LAWN.

20:50.083 --> 20:51.584
OH, THERE GOES

20:50.083 --> 20:51.584
THE BREAKFAST SANDWICH.

20:51.625 --> 20:53.627
NO. LET'S HURRY.

20:51.625 --> 20:53.627
WE CAN STILL DO LUKE'S.

20:53.669 --> 20:54.879
MOM!

20:53.669 --> 20:54.879
LET'S GO!

20:54.921 --> 20:57.006
MY SHOES.

20:54.921 --> 20:57.006
YOU DON'T NEED SHOES.

20:57.048 --> 21:01.594
IN MY DAY, WE WALKED

20:57.048 --> 21:01.594
20 MILES IN THE SNOW

20:57.048 --> 21:01.594
JUST TO GET TO OUR SHOES.

21:01.635 --> 21:05.639
OKAY, COME ON.

21:01.635 --> 21:05.639
SPRINKLE.

21:08.768 --> 21:11.020
DRINK UP. WE GOT

21:08.768 --> 21:11.020
A BREAKFAST TO GET TO.

21:11.062 --> 21:12.897
MOM, I THINK

21:11.062 --> 21:12.897
THIS IS FOR YOU.

21:12.939 --> 21:15.066
"LORELAI" -- NO,

21:12.939 --> 21:15.066
MUST BE SOMEONE ELSE.

21:15.108 --> 21:17.110
HEY, DON'T READ THAT.

21:15.108 --> 21:17.110
DO NOT READ THAT.

21:17.151 --> 21:18.694
I'M TELLING YOU,

21:17.151 --> 21:18.694
IT'S NO GOOD.

21:18.736 --> 21:20.613
"DEAR LORELAI" --

21:18.736 --> 21:20.613
AND SHE'S READING IT.

21:20.654 --> 21:23.991
"JUST A FEW THINGS THAT

21:20.654 --> 21:23.991
CAME TO MIND AFTER WE TALKED.

21:20.654 --> 21:23.991
OH, GREAT.

21:24.033 --> 21:25.785
"THANK YOU FOR

21:24.033 --> 21:25.785
THE VERY KIND FAVOR.

21:25.826 --> 21:27.578

21:25.826 --> 21:27.578
THAT ANYBODY WOULD BE

21:27.620 --> 21:29.747
SO KIND TO SOMEONE

21:27.620 --> 21:29.747
THEY JUST MET."

21:29.789 --> 21:33.126
APPARENTLY DWIGHT'S

21:29.789 --> 21:33.126
LAST HOME WAS OZ, AND NOT

21:29.789 --> 21:33.126

21:33.167 --> 21:35.711
"SECOND, SINCE YOU

21:51.144 --> 21:54.563
I'M NOT GOING

21:51.144 --> 21:54.563
IN THAT HOUSE.

21:54.605 --> 21:56.565
RORY, DO NOT

21:54.605 --> 21:56.565
PICK UP THAT KEY.

21:56.607 --> 22:00.027
BUT WE HAVE TO WATER

21:56.607 --> 22:00.027
THE VIOLETS.

21:56.607 --> 22:00.027
NO, HE THREW THE VIOLETS IN

22:00.069 --> 22:02.321
AFTER HE'D ALREADY ROOKED ME

22:00.069 --> 22:02.321
INTO WATERING HIS LAWN.

22:02.362 --> 22:06.159
DON'T YOU AT LEAST WANT TO SEE

22:02.362 --> 22:06.159
WHAT HIS HOUSE LOOKS LIKE?

22:02.362 --> 22:06.159
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

22:06.200 --> 22:08.161
[ SIGHS ] KEY, PLEASE.

22:08.202 --> 22:10.454
LET ME JUST SAY

22:08.202 --> 22:10.454
IF WE WALK IN THERE

22:10.496 --> 22:14.000
AND HIS DEAD MOTHER IS SITTING

22:10.496 --> 22:14.000
IN A ROCKING CHAIR,

22:10.496 --> 22:14.000
NOT A BIT SURPRISED.

22:17.044 --> 22:19.839
OH, YEAH, DWIGHT.

22:17.044 --> 22:19.839
THIS PLACE IS GREAT.

22:19.880 --> 22:22.300
SOMEONE TOOK THE WHOLE

22:19.880 --> 22:22.300
LOUNGE CRAZE VERY SERIOUSLY.

22:22.341 --> 22:25.011
