00:01.560 --> 00:02.811
<i>Marry me, Brooke Davis.</i>

00:02.862 --> 00:03.912
Yes. Okay.

00:03.979 --> 00:05.012
Now I'm redoing
everything,

00:05.064 --> 00:06.648
and the more
that I think about it,

00:06.699 --> 00:07.866
the more frustrated I get.

00:07.950 --> 00:09.651
Okay, you know what?
Out of sight, out of mind.

00:09.702 --> 00:11.236
This book
is only confusing you.

00:11.320 --> 00:13.571
Oh, no, no, no.
What if it rains?

00:13.656 --> 00:15.323
No, my son and
beautiful daughter-in-law

00:15.374 --> 00:17.542
will not be married in a tent
like circus folk.

00:17.626 --> 00:19.911
I booked the banquet room
at The Oaks.

00:19.995 --> 00:21.546
I said I can't afford it.

00:21.630 --> 00:23.715
I told you --
I'm taking care of it.

00:23.799 --> 00:24.966
I don't want to take
your input.

00:25.033 --> 00:26.801
I don't like The Oaks.

00:26.869 --> 00:28.035
I don't really like
any of it.

00:28.087 --> 00:29.804
Good luck
with the backyard hootenanny.

00:29.872 --> 00:34.125
Taking this class is like
entering into a contract.

00:34.193 --> 00:35.093
Mr. Scott?

00:35.177 --> 00:36.544
I've been required to pass

00:36.595 --> 00:38.480
marquee athletes for years.

00:38.547 --> 00:40.849
But I don't have to
pass <i>you.</i>

00:40.900 --> 00:43.568
I intend to hold up my end
of the contract.

00:43.652 --> 00:44.769
I won't hold my breath.

00:48.107 --> 00:50.742
Oh.

00:50.826 --> 00:52.160
Ahh.

00:54.780 --> 00:56.915
Please, God,
get me through this.

00:56.999 --> 00:59.400
I promise I will <i>never</i>
<i>drink again.</i>

00:59.451 --> 01:01.336

Just try not to get so drunk
that you end up puking.

01:21.941 --> 01:23.608
Oh, I can't
guarantee anything.

01:23.692 --> 01:25.894
You know, what happens
at a bachelor party...

01:25.945 --> 01:28.863
That stupid rule
never applies.

01:28.931 --> 01:30.982
Well, you have nothing
to worry about,

01:31.066 --> 01:33.117
especially since
you already helped me

01:33.202 --> 01:35.269
fill my misbehaving quota
for the day --

01:35.321 --> 01:36.538

01:49.218 --> 01:52.053

01:52.120 --> 01:53.471
Mm-hmm.

01:53.556 --> 01:54.939

to wear it for very long.

01:55.007 --> 01:56.841
Oh, really.
What do you girls have planned?

01:56.926 --> 01:59.427
Well, let's just say...

01:59.478 --> 02:01.913
I might have random guys' hands

I just have to read
this entire book by Monday,

02:24.503 --> 02:26.320
and I can't stop
thinking about Kellerman

02:26.372 --> 02:27.672
calling me a nescient jock.
Mm.

02:27.756 --> 02:29.173
I don't even know
what "nescient" means.

02:29.258 --> 02:31.042
It means "uneducated."

02:31.126 --> 02:33.011
Why wouldn't he just
say "uneducated"?

02:33.095 --> 02:34.712
'Cause he's a pompous
college Professor,

02:34.797 --> 02:36.681

02:36.765 --> 02:38.383
I would read that book.

02:38.467 --> 02:40.018
That's all you got?

02:40.102 --> 02:41.335
Just read the book

Professor what's-his-face.

02:42.354 --> 02:43.521
Kellerman.
Who?

02:43.589 --> 02:44.505
Keller--
who?

02:44.556 --> 02:46.641
Okay.
I'll read the book.

02:46.692 --> 02:47.692
Okay.
Thanks, Hales.

03:03.909 --> 03:05.043
His name's August?
Yes.

03:05.127 --> 03:06.694
Ooh,
he even <i>sounds</i> mean.

03:06.745 --> 03:08.029

of summer.

03:08.080 --> 03:09.547
Yeah.

03:09.632 --> 03:11.799
This Kellerman guy made himself
a powerful enemy today,

03:11.867 --> 03:13.384

Who invited Alex?

03:19.475 --> 03:20.892
I did.

03:20.976 --> 03:23.144
You invited her to Thanksgiving.
What's the problem?

03:23.211 --> 03:25.563

03:29.635 --> 03:30.601
Well, let's face it.

03:30.719 --> 03:32.070
She's always
gonna be the girl

03:32.154 --> 03:33.788
who got naked
in front of my boyfriend.

03:33.856 --> 03:34.889
True.

03:34.940 --> 03:36.441
I can uninvite her.

03:36.525 --> 03:38.493
She <i>did</i> get us

I can't have alcohol...

Homeopathic.

exactly?

04:36.085 --> 04:37.385
It's perfectly safe.

04:37.452 --> 04:39.620
I think we're gonna stick
with cucumber water.

04:39.671 --> 04:41.672
Thanks, though.

04:43.142 --> 04:45.126
Wow, Millie.

04:45.177 --> 04:46.978
You really thought
of everything.

04:47.062 --> 04:48.629
Oh! Brooke, you
have to wear this.

04:48.680 --> 04:50.314
Uh, no.

04:50.399 --> 04:51.649
I love you,

04:51.734 --> 04:54.185
but I can't wear anything
made of whatever that is.

Cheers.

05:03.662 --> 05:04.412
Cheers.

05:15.791 --> 05:16.657
Wow.

05:24.349 --> 05:26.601
You want some doughnuts?
Mmm.

05:26.668 --> 05:27.602
No!

05:27.669 --> 05:28.553

Rise and shine.

05:32.391 --> 05:33.975
Oh, my God.

05:34.026 --> 05:35.726
Is that a <i>dog</i> collar?

05:35.811 --> 05:38.696
Ugh.
Is that why my neck is sore?

05:38.781 --> 05:41.616
Ohh.
I think I bit my tongue.

05:41.683 --> 05:44.185
My back hurts.

05:44.236 --> 05:45.787
I feel fine!

05:47.072 --> 05:48.156
What?

05:48.207 --> 05:50.191
You have
a massive black eye.

05:50.242 --> 05:51.192
What?

05:51.243 --> 05:53.828
Ow. Ow.

05:53.879 --> 05:56.197
Why are you talking
like you have your retainer in?

05:56.248 --> 05:57.465
Why are you talking

05:57.532 --> 05:58.549
like you have
your retainer in?

06:00.302 --> 06:01.419
Open your mouth.

06:03.005 --> 06:04.472

06:04.539 --> 06:06.057
Unh!

06:06.141 --> 06:07.391
Come on!

06:07.476 --> 06:08.709
No, I don't want to.
Help me!

Say "please."

06:18.570 --> 06:21.772

were taken.

06:21.840 --> 06:24.992
No. What are you doing
at my party?

06:25.060 --> 06:27.912
The party was last night,
sweetie.

06:27.996 --> 06:30.364
Uh, can you get me
some water?

06:30.415 --> 06:32.066
My mouth is burning.

06:32.117 --> 06:34.285
Yeah.

06:41.409 --> 06:42.627
Huh!

06:42.711 --> 06:44.762
My engagement ring!

06:44.847 --> 06:47.131

I mean, it was insured, right?

08:24.942 --> 08:28.194
Personally, I never really

We're gonna -- we're gonna find

08:31.832 --> 08:34.232
Let's retrace your steps.
What did you guys <i>do</i> last night?

08:34.284 --> 08:36.452
I don't remember.
I don't remember <i>anything.</i>

08:36.535 --> 08:38.404
I don't even remember
Sylvia crashing.

08:38.455 --> 08:40.840
I did <i>not</i> crash.

08:40.907 --> 08:43.376
I came by
to drop off a gift,

08:43.427 --> 08:46.012
and you all insisted
that I stay.

08:46.079 --> 08:47.680
I barely got through the door

08:47.747 --> 08:50.800
before somebody handed me
some -- ugh! --

08:50.884 --> 08:52.301
hippie energy drink.

08:52.386 --> 08:54.603
I <i>loved</i> that drink.

08:54.688 --> 08:56.088
I knew those drinks
were bad news.

08:56.139 --> 08:57.556
What was in those?

08:57.607 --> 08:59.442
I don't know.
Energy?

09:00.978 --> 09:03.112
I will call and find out.

09:03.196 --> 09:04.480
Okay.

09:04.564 --> 09:07.533
Ew! Why is there raw meat
in my purse?

09:07.600 --> 09:08.985
Is my ring in there?!

09:09.069 --> 09:10.369
Sick!

09:10.437 --> 09:11.654
Oh, you know what?
That's a good idea.

09:11.738 --> 09:12.705
Everybody check
their purses.

09:12.772 --> 09:14.623
Uh...

09:14.708 --> 09:17.126
Well, if it makes you feel
any better, Brooke,

09:17.210 --> 09:18.277
I lost my phone.

09:18.328 --> 09:20.997
It doesn't.

09:21.081 --> 09:22.999
Oh, my gosh, you guys,
it's Julian.

09:23.083 --> 09:24.500
What am I gonna say to him?

09:24.584 --> 09:27.837
I will buy us some time.

09:27.921 --> 09:29.305
Okay.

09:31.224 --> 09:32.224
Morning, gorgeous.

09:32.292 --> 09:33.759
If you don't get home soon,

09:33.810 --> 09:35.895
I might have to misbehave
all by myself.

09:35.962 --> 09:38.314
Good morning, honey.

09:39.766 --> 09:41.817
Mom?!
Why are <i>you</i> still there?

09:41.902 --> 09:44.020
Why does everyone
keep asking me that?

09:44.104 --> 09:45.237
Uh, well,
why didn't Brooke answer?

09:45.305 --> 09:46.138
Is she okay?

09:48.608 --> 09:50.026
She's as happy as a baby.

09:50.110 --> 09:51.660
Well, let me talk to her.

09:51.745 --> 09:53.863
Uh, no.
It's -- it's bad luck

09:53.947 --> 09:56.982
to talk to the bride
before the dress rehearsal.

09:57.034 --> 09:58.667
I thought it was bad luck
to <i>see</i> the bride before --

09:58.752 --> 10:00.086
it's all unlucky.

10:00.153 --> 10:02.821
Julian, we're dealing
with pre-wedding stuff

10:02.873 --> 10:05.674
and girl bonding and --

10:05.759 --> 10:07.093
and she'll give you
a ring later.

10:16.136 --> 10:17.970
Any luck?

10:18.021 --> 10:19.805
Well,
somebody got <i>lucky.</i>

10:19.856 --> 10:20.973
At least they were safe.
Ohh.

10:21.024 --> 10:22.475
Okay.

10:22.526 --> 10:24.560
This is one of those
good-news-bad-news things.

10:24.644 --> 10:26.946
The good news is, the drinks
were perfectly healthy...

10:27.013 --> 10:28.464
Unless you mix them
with alcohol.

10:28.532 --> 10:30.349
That was the bad news.

10:30.400 --> 10:31.367
I am gonna --

10:31.451 --> 10:32.851
okay, no, no, no.

10:32.903 --> 10:35.071
You already probably made her
pay for it with the...

10:35.155 --> 10:37.022
Oh! This is good.
A receipt from a tattoo parlor.

10:37.074 --> 10:38.524
One embarrassing
tongue piercing...

10:38.575 --> 10:40.042
That's me.

10:40.127 --> 10:41.827
...One tattoo.

10:43.246 --> 10:45.014
Oh.

10:46.533 --> 10:48.700
It's like an x-rated version
of "where's Waldo?"

10:48.752 --> 10:49.802
No!

10:52.005 --> 10:53.539
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

10:53.590 --> 10:55.057
That looks like henna
or something.

10:55.142 --> 10:55.975
That's got to be,
like --

10:56.042 --> 10:57.726
oh, it's chocolate.

10:57.811 --> 10:59.378
Did you just <i>taste</i> that?

10:59.429 --> 11:00.980
I'm pregnant.

11:01.047 --> 11:02.014
Well, before you eat
the rest of it,

11:02.065 --> 11:03.015
maybe we should call it.

11:03.066 --> 11:03.899
Found it!

11:03.984 --> 11:04.984
My ring?!

11:05.051 --> 11:06.819
Millie's ho tag.

11:08.071 --> 11:10.189
Ho tag?
It's called a tramp stamp.

11:10.240 --> 11:11.524
What is it?!

11:11.575 --> 11:12.558
Oh. Then why don't
<i>you</i> have one?

11:12.609 --> 11:13.776
I have one.

11:13.860 --> 11:15.244
What is it?!

11:20.033 --> 11:21.283
Come on. Come on.

11:21.368 --> 11:22.401
Don't --

11:22.452 --> 11:23.786
okay. Okay.
Don't let it run.

11:23.870 --> 11:25.955
Why would I get <i>boots?</i>

11:26.039 --> 11:28.674
Why? Why?

11:28.741 --> 11:30.092
Um, because
that tattoo kicks <i>ass.</i>

11:31.928 --> 11:34.096
We could always ask
the tattoo artist.

11:34.181 --> 11:35.181
I'm going with.

11:35.248 --> 11:36.915
This is gonna
be awesome!

11:38.751 --> 11:41.103
We're going
to the tattoo parlor.

11:41.188 --> 11:43.139
Maybe they'll have
your ring there.

11:43.223 --> 11:45.257
Oh, can we take the
skateboarding dog with us?

11:45.308 --> 11:47.943
Take him.
He's getting really annoying.

11:48.028 --> 11:50.613
Come on!
Come on!

11:53.266 --> 11:54.900
Come on.

11:54.985 --> 11:57.036
<i>Hey. You know why</i>
<i>I can't come to the phone.</i>

11:57.103 --> 11:59.655
<i>I'm Dave Navarro.</i>
<i>Speak.</i>

11:59.739 --> 12:01.574
It's probably not
<i>the</i> Dave Navarro.

12:01.625 --> 12:04.443
Why do you have a rock star's
phone number on your leg?

12:04.494 --> 12:06.795
<i>You</i> tell <i>me.</i>

12:08.298 --> 12:10.115
Tree Hill, last night!

12:10.167 --> 12:11.550
Oh, my God!

12:11.618 --> 12:13.502
What the hell were you guys
doing with Dave Navarro?!

12:13.587 --> 12:15.304
What the hell
am I wearing?!

12:15.388 --> 12:16.805
What the hell
did we do last night?!

12:28.188 --> 12:29.188
'Stache?

12:30.423 --> 12:32.808
Hey. What's up, boots?

12:32.892 --> 12:34.360
I'll be with you
in a minute.

12:36.062 --> 12:38.314
Did that guy
just call you "boots"?

12:38.398 --> 12:41.116
He must have thought
I was somebody else.

12:41.201 --> 12:42.868
Yeah, you're right.

12:42.935 --> 12:44.269
He probably thought
you were some <i>other</i> girl

12:44.321 --> 12:46.155
with boots tattooed
above your ass.

12:46.239 --> 12:48.390
How could I
be so stupid?

12:48.458 --> 12:50.159
I'm gonna have to
explain this tattoo

12:50.226 --> 12:51.410
for the rest
of my life.

12:51.461 --> 12:53.128
Oh, it's not that bad.

12:53.196 --> 12:54.630
I got this one,

12:54.714 --> 12:56.298
and nobody ever asks me
why I got it.

12:56.383 --> 12:57.299
Why'd you get it?

12:57.384 --> 12:59.718
Until now.

12:59.786 --> 13:01.587
It's no secret
I tried to kill myself.

13:01.638 --> 13:03.222
So I use this tattoo
as a reminder

13:03.289 --> 13:04.640
to believe in something.

13:04.724 --> 13:06.792
I mean, it's the only failure
that I'm proud of.

13:06.843 --> 13:08.594
Besides,
if I hadn't have failed,

13:08.645 --> 13:09.662
I would've missed out
on all of this.

13:09.729 --> 13:10.679
Right, boots?

13:13.566 --> 13:15.801
Millie, check it out!

13:15.852 --> 13:18.654
You're only a few tattoos
behind Dave Navarro!

13:24.744 --> 13:27.646
All right, I'm gonna go
check the box office.

13:29.783 --> 13:32.835
Wow, I haven't been
to a concert in <i>so</i> long.

13:32.919 --> 13:36.922
Melissa and I
used to go all the time.

13:36.989 --> 13:38.674
Who's Melissa?

13:38.758 --> 13:41.093
She was my best friend
growing up.

13:41.160 --> 13:42.711
This one time,

13:42.796 --> 13:45.264
she pretended
to be an A&R rep

13:45.331 --> 13:48.017
so that I could meet
Steven Tyler.

13:48.101 --> 13:49.167
Do you know --

13:49.219 --> 13:50.519
he's with Aerosmith?

13:50.603 --> 13:51.854
Yeah, I know who he is.

13:51.938 --> 13:54.940
Bet you and Haley
have some good...Stories.

13:55.007 --> 13:56.942
We do.

13:57.009 --> 13:58.677
But most of
my concert stories

13:58.728 --> 14:00.362
are with my
best friend, too --

14:00.447 --> 14:01.346
Peyton.

14:01.398 --> 14:03.232
Yeah, I remember Peyton.

14:03.316 --> 14:05.534
Is she coming
to the wedding?

14:05.618 --> 14:06.952
Unfortunately, no.

14:08.354 --> 14:09.371
But don't tell Haley.

14:09.456 --> 14:10.856
I haven't told her yet,
and...

14:10.907 --> 14:14.159
Melissa didn't come
to my wedding, either.

14:14.210 --> 14:15.744
Really?

14:15.829 --> 14:16.962
It's probably
for the best.

14:17.029 --> 14:18.380
I didn't really care
for Peyton.

14:18.465 --> 14:20.198
I thought
you <i>liked</i> her.

14:20.250 --> 14:22.718
No, <i>Paul</i> liked her.

14:22.802 --> 14:25.671
So...No ring.

14:25.722 --> 14:27.506
Sorry.

14:27.557 --> 14:28.841
But I did find out why
the concert was canceled.

14:28.892 --> 14:30.893
Apparently
they lost Dave Navarro.

14:30.977 --> 14:32.511
And the last they heard,

14:32.562 --> 14:35.547
he was riding a bull
with some bachelorette party.

Why'd Millie get a boot tattoo?

15:05.912 --> 15:07.880
'Cause of her nickname.

15:07.931 --> 15:09.715
I thought the nickname
came from the tattoo.

31:27.825 --> 31:29.593
I do not smother him.

31:29.660 --> 31:32.212
You showed up
here unannounced

31:32.296 --> 31:36.499
and then tried to bully your way
into <i>our</i> wedding.

31:36.551 --> 31:38.101
All right, you know what?

31:38.168 --> 31:40.136

Julian moved away from L.A.

32:04.545 --> 32:06.529
No, he just came to be
with a girl

last night?

Nice.

32:36.490 --> 32:39.608
Um, well, they --
they kind of met Kellerman,

32:39.660 --> 32:41.911

Come on, big dog.

33:34.831 --> 33:36.632
Vandalism.

33:36.684 --> 33:38.601

33:38.668 --> 33:40.636
I could have you
arrested, Scott.

33:40.721 --> 33:44.507
I don't think so.
We have a binding contract.

33:44.558 --> 33:46.175
No questions asked.

33:49.947 --> 33:51.397
And according

33:51.482 --> 33:53.015
in Chapter 11

33:53.067 --> 33:55.134
the best thing for you to do
in this situation

33:55.202 --> 33:56.152
is to say "thank you."

33:58.989 --> 34:01.157
It's not bad
for an uneducated jock, huh?

34:04.912 --> 34:07.663
See you in class,
Kellerman.

34:09.049 --> 34:10.382
Come on, Dogust.

is just now ending.

at a bachelorette party...

34:21.678 --> 34:22.812

never applies.

with my mom?

34:28.485 --> 34:30.737
We got into a fight.

34:30.821 --> 34:34.524
Oh, I'm sure it was just
the alcohol talking.

34:34.574 --> 34:37.326
Well, the alcohol said
some really mean things.

34:37.393 --> 34:38.726
She doesn't mean it.

34:38.779 --> 34:41.080
I said some
pretty mean things, too.

34:41.165 --> 34:42.614
Don't worry about it.

34:42.699 --> 34:46.502
You'll -- you'll work it out
at the rehearsal dinner, okay?

34:46.587 --> 34:49.405
We might not need
the rehearsal dinner anymore.

34:52.909 --> 34:56.579
I don't deserve you,
Julian.

34:56.630 --> 34:58.431
I did something
horrible.

35:00.300 --> 35:04.353
Well Two things.

35:04.421 --> 35:07.623
I...Lost
my engagement ring...

35:07.691 --> 35:12.478
And...I kissed some guy.

35:12.563 --> 35:15.598
I promise you
it will never happen again,

35:15.649 --> 35:17.817
and it didn't
mean anything.

35:17.901 --> 35:20.386
I-I don't even remember
who he was.

35:20.454 --> 35:22.438
