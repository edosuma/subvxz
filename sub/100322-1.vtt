<i>The UN's talking about
getting refugees back,</i>

00:23.180 --> 00:26.179
<i>but there's no water,
no electricity, no work.</i>

00:26.180 --> 00:27.869
<i>There's nothing to go home to.</i>

00:27.870 --> 00:31.409
<i>So we should focus on
basic infrastructure.</i>

00:31.410 --> 00:32.710
<i>Yeah.</i>

00:34.210 --> 00:36.620
<i>Jun0537,
London Centre.</i>

00:37.160 --> 00:39.839
Climb and maintain
flight level 130.

00:39.840 --> 00:41.990
Route direct to Ashwood Airfield.

00:49.390 --> 00:50.950
Come on, come on.

01:00.170 --> 01:03.000
<i>- So you want to come see the flight deck?</i>
- Can I, Mum?

01:04.370 --> 01:05.950
Come on, come on.

01:10.040 --> 01:11.890
Right, go.

01:22.430 --> 01:26.180
Jun0537, London Centre.
Radio check.

01:31.060 --> 01:35.419
Jun0537, climb and maintain
flight level 130.

01:35.420 --> 01:37.540
Adjust your altitude,
Jun0537.

01:38.350 --> 01:39.990
Hey. Open up. Come on!

01:45.070 --> 01:47.559
Jun0537, London Centre.
Climb immediately,

01:47.560 --> 01:50.880
repeat, immediately
to flight level 130.

01:55.390 --> 01:56.870
Hey, kiddo.

01:57.580 --> 01:59.530
<i>Dad!
Dad!</i>

02:00.140 --> 02:01.989
Mum's hurt!

02:01.990 --> 02:03.899
- Where is she?
- They couldn't get

02:03.900 --> 02:05.369
through the door!

02:05.370 --> 02:07.359
Jun0537,
London centre.

02:07.360 --> 02:10.770
<i>Dad!</i>
Please, help!

02:11.850 --> 02:13.900
Adjust your altitude,
Juno...

02:14.940 --> 02:16.929
Help us!
Please!

02:16.930 --> 02:18.509

SILENT WITNESS
Season 23 - Episode 01

02:56.590 --> 02:59.610
"Deadhead"
Part 1 of 2

04:05.360 --> 04:06.780
Dr. Alexander?

04:07.090 --> 04:09.759
- Yes.
- I'm Jess Fisher, AAIB.

04:09.760 --> 04:11.069
Hi.

04:11.070 --> 04:13.069
So who was on it?

04:13.070 --> 04:17.819
A couple of pilots -
Alex Vitarnen and Rowan Cole.

04:17.820 --> 04:20.209
Passengers were Miriam Heller,

04:20.209 --> 04:22.179
head of a charity -

04:22.180 --> 04:24.020
the Global Crisis Committee.

04:25.040 --> 04:28.549
Her son, Ezra,
along for the ride.

04:28.550 --> 04:30.270
11 years old.

04:31.010 --> 04:33.750
And Jonathan Kraft.

04:34.070 --> 04:35.909
The Jonathan Kraft?

04:35.910 --> 04:39.019
As in ex-US Ambassador
Jonathan Kraft?

04:39.020 --> 04:40.450
He was onboard?

04:42.010 --> 04:44.029
<i>Hi, this is Matt.
I can't get to the phone.</i>

04:44.030 --> 04:45.609
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

04:45.610 --> 04:47.899
Matt, can you give me a call?

04:47.900 --> 04:50.039
As soon as you get this.

04:50.040 --> 04:51.349
Love you.

04:51.350 --> 04:53.010
The coroner's on her way.

05:03.050 --> 05:05.449
Our priority is body recovery.

05:05.450 --> 05:08.009
Which is for us at The Lyell
and the police to co-ordinate.

05:08.010 --> 05:09.319
Yeah, absolutely.

05:09.320 --> 05:12.119
- Have all the bodies been accounted for?
- Not all.

05:12.120 --> 05:13.999
The captain is still
in the left seat,

05:14.000 --> 05:16.559
and there was a second non-flying
pilot hitching a lift

05:16.560 --> 05:18.649
back from Amsterdam,
the originating airport.

05:18.650 --> 05:21.699
The passengers are
harder to identify.

05:21.700 --> 05:25.749
There was a child on board,
11-year-old Ezra Heller.

05:25.750 --> 05:27.639
We haven't yet identified his body.

05:27.640 --> 05:30.689
Both the adult passengers
were public figures.

05:30.690 --> 05:33.049
Miriam Heller was
the public face of an NGO,

05:33.050 --> 05:35.659
which is why they were in
Amsterdam for a conference,

05:35.660 --> 05:40.079
and Jonathan Kraft, obviously,
so we need to rule out foul play.

05:40.080 --> 05:42.059
So body recovery.

05:42.060 --> 05:44.650
Minimum recoverable
tissue is what?

05:45.010 --> 05:47.479
In the past, we've worked on
five millimetre cubed and up.

05:47.480 --> 05:50.049
New guidelines are
to recover everything we can.

05:50.050 --> 05:52.189
Of course.
We done?

05:52.190 --> 05:56.009
Can I ask that we restrict
the site to UK personnel only?

05:56.010 --> 05:58.169
I don't want a tug-of-war
over bodies.

05:58.170 --> 05:59.470
Thank you.

07:08.070 --> 07:10.550
The Embassy called.
What's happening?

07:12.050 --> 07:13.350
<i>Matt...</i>

07:16.050 --> 07:18.069
Jonathan didn't make it.

07:18.070 --> 07:19.370
<i>No.</i>

07:20.090 --> 07:22.190
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

07:27.710 --> 07:29.319
<i>He was on a target list.</i>

07:29.320 --> 07:31.729
He's been getting terrorist threats
from fascist groups in America.

07:31.730 --> 07:33.179
Do the police know?

07:33.180 --> 07:35.579
<i>- They'll be following that up.</i>
- Not if they don't know,

07:35.580 --> 07:38.299
and they won't know unless somebody
tells them. I'll come down.

07:38.300 --> 07:40.049
Maybe wait.

07:40.050 --> 07:42.770
They're restricting access
at the moment.

07:43.080 --> 07:45.049
<i>What about his family?</i>

07:45.050 --> 07:47.259
I told the Embassy
I'd call Louise.

07:47.260 --> 07:48.750
She's in Washington.

07:50.010 --> 07:51.310
Their son...

07:53.070 --> 07:55.210
..Charlie's at Caltech.

08:01.030 --> 08:02.600
I love you.

08:03.060 --> 08:04.590
I better go...

08:05.480 --> 08:06.890
..make that call.

08:30.720 --> 08:32.328
<i>Yeah,
so we need to make sure</i>

08:32.330 --> 08:34.880
<i>all the markers are
in the right places.</i>

08:51.040 --> 08:53.939
Significant damage
to his head and neck

08:53.940 --> 08:56.140
- from the collapsing roof.
- I'll say.

08:57.470 --> 09:00.250
His hands are still
on the control yoke, too.

09:03.070 --> 09:05.369
Body's relatively intact.

09:05.370 --> 09:06.929
Miraculously.

09:06.930 --> 09:09.290
I think it's because
of the angle of impact.

09:10.080 --> 09:14.519
Plane came down, I think,
nose pointing up.

09:14.520 --> 09:17.079
The tail hit the ground first.

09:17.080 --> 09:19.399
Looks like a straight fuel fire.

09:19.400 --> 09:20.949
First impressions.

09:20.950 --> 09:23.059
Aw, can you take a look, Jack -
see what you think?

09:23.060 --> 09:24.360
Sure.

09:28.030 --> 09:30.109
- Finnish.
- Finished?

09:30.110 --> 09:33.450
No, as in he was a Finn.
It's on the manifest.

10:23.070 --> 10:26.920
The boy's phone.

10:39.040 --> 10:40.490
Mr. Heller.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.499
Mr. Heller.
Look, I know.

10:43.500 --> 10:45.459
I understand,
but it's a restricted area.

10:45.460 --> 10:48.860
I know it's hard, but now you're
here, let's go and talk over here.

10:50.060 --> 10:51.360
OK?

11:03.060 --> 11:04.360
Thanks.

11:15.020 --> 11:17.600
Was he thrown clear
or did he move himself?

11:21.010 --> 11:22.669
Open comminuted fractures

11:22.670 --> 11:26.209
with a traumatic amputation
of the right leg below the knee.

11:26.210 --> 11:29.780
No blood trail, so that would
suggest he was thrown clear.

11:32.570 --> 11:35.859
Hey, Jess? Do you know if
any of your AAIB people

11:35.860 --> 11:37.939
approached the site
from this direction?

11:37.940 --> 11:40.319
Not to my knowledge, no.
We all came in from over there.

11:40.320 --> 11:42.449
What about emergency
services personnel?

11:42.450 --> 11:44.339
They came from the west,
same as us.

11:44.340 --> 11:45.909
You sure no-one came in this way?

11:45.910 --> 11:47.210
Why are you asking?

11:54.010 --> 11:55.459
Hey.
Where are you?

11:55.460 --> 11:57.069
<i>Hi. Edge of the woods
by the nose.</i>

11:57.070 --> 12:00.589
Listen. Someone's accessed the site
from the east, the woodland there.

12:00.590 --> 12:01.949
Can you look in to it, please?

12:01.950 --> 12:03.709
Yeah, I'll check with
the first responders, yeah.

12:03.710 --> 12:05.010
Thank you.

12:07.010 --> 12:10.029
We've got the cockpit voice recorder
and flight data recorder.

12:10.030 --> 12:11.730
They're still in the tail section.

12:17.030 --> 12:19.240
It was a work thing for Miriam.

12:20.020 --> 12:23.219
- I wasn't invited.
- But Ezra was?

12:23.220 --> 12:25.339
We've got friends in Amsterdam.

12:25.340 --> 12:26.939
His best friend, Noor.

12:26.940 --> 12:29.549
He sent a cheeky e-mail
to Jonathan Kraft

12:29.550 --> 12:31.850
to ask if he could
hitch a ride over.

12:33.030 --> 12:34.880
He was really nice about it.

12:38.030 --> 12:40.079
Ezra called me from the plane

12:40.080 --> 12:42.100
when it was in trouble.

12:42.710 --> 12:44.010
OK.

12:45.020 --> 12:46.690
Wanted me to help them.

12:49.890 --> 12:51.199
Michael,

12:51.200 --> 12:54.030
we need to know if
it was a deliberate act.

12:55.030 --> 12:58.710
Did Ezra say anything
about the plane -

12:59.020 --> 13:00.850
about what was happening?

13:03.030 --> 13:05.380
that Miriam was hurt, and...

13:05.990 --> 13:08.200
they couldn't get
through a door.

13:08.810 --> 13:11.400
A door to the flight deck?

13:13.760 --> 13:16.209
There was another pilot
on the plane.

13:16.210 --> 13:18.540
A non-flying pilot.

13:19.040 --> 13:21.999
Did Ezra mention him?

13:22.000 --> 13:24.010
Was he on the flight deck?

13:24.800 --> 13:26.540
I don't know.

13:28.880 --> 13:30.530
I wasn't there.

13:35.680 --> 13:38.630
Is that the black box?
It's orange.

13:56.750 --> 13:58.050
Jess?

14:04.290 --> 14:05.590
Paramedic!

14:06.160 --> 14:07.469
I think it's the boy.

14:07.470 --> 14:09.629
We need a HEMS teams over here
right away, please!

14:09.630 --> 14:12.039
Ezra. Ezra, it's going
to be all right.

14:12.040 --> 14:14.890
- Get some Fire Service down here!
- We need cutters.

14:16.010 --> 14:17.859
Nikki, it's the boy.
Talk to him.

14:17.860 --> 14:19.269
- Ezra.
<i>- Jess, how we doing?</i>

14:19.270 --> 14:21.859
<i>- On their way, Jack.</i>
- It's going to be OK

14:21.860 --> 14:24.359
- We're going to get you out of here.
<i>- Fire, down here!</i>

14:24.360 --> 14:26.409
- Jess, I want to get in here.
- No, Jack, wait!

14:26.410 --> 14:28.139
- They're almost here.
- No. I'm not waiting.

14:28.140 --> 14:29.999
- Get me something! No, I'm not waiting.
- Are you sure?

14:30.000 --> 14:31.300
<i>Can we get Fire in?!</i>

14:45.040 --> 14:46.800
Let them do their job.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.609
11 years of age.
Pulse tachycardic at 140.

14:51.610 --> 14:53.639
Ezra?
He's not responding.

14:53.640 --> 14:56.060
Blood pressure 80 over 50.
Ezra!

14:56.570 --> 14:58.220
Ezra, can you hear me?

15:16.050 --> 15:18.579
What software are you using
for the drone mapping?

15:18.580 --> 15:21.019
- KiteTech.
- Clarissa's recommendation.

15:21.020 --> 15:22.800
Better not slag it off, then.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.529
How did you
get into this AAIB business?

15:26.530 --> 15:29.189
I was a pilot
on commercial airlines

15:29.190 --> 15:31.399
then studied aeronautical
engineering.

15:31.400 --> 15:34.339
Clarissa came and gave a lecture
on aviation forensics.

15:34.340 --> 15:35.640
Did she know?

15:36.030 --> 15:38.189
Any joy with the bootprints,
by the way?

15:38.190 --> 15:39.739
Nothing.

15:39.740 --> 15:41.849
I'll check our
crew again for you.

15:41.850 --> 15:43.159
It may have been one of them.

15:43.160 --> 15:45.289
Stepping on the wreckage?
Why would they do that?

15:45.290 --> 15:47.989
Well, I've asked.
Nobody's owning up to it,

15:47.990 --> 15:50.530
even when I put the screws on them.

16:01.010 --> 16:03.060
- Hi.
- Hi.

16:03.770 --> 16:05.099
Miriam Heller.

16:05.100 --> 16:06.400
Jonathan Kraft.

16:06.800 --> 16:10.029
We've ID'd body parts
as well as we can at this stage.

16:10.030 --> 16:11.419
Dental records?

16:11.420 --> 16:14.710
Got Miriam's, and we're waiting
for Washington to send over Kraft's.

16:15.020 --> 16:17.709
There's a vertical laceration
over the frontal bone,

16:17.710 --> 16:20.269
distal radius fractured
on both arms,

16:20.270 --> 16:21.829
obviously displaced.

16:21.830 --> 16:25.039
That's why I think high-impact
trauma rather than heat damage.

16:25.040 --> 16:28.139
What, some sort of reflex action?

16:28.140 --> 16:31.190
She puts her hands out
when the plane goes into a dive?

16:36.090 --> 16:37.399
Clarissa.

16:37.400 --> 16:39.579
Hi.
I wanted to let you know

16:39.580 --> 16:43.419
that counter terrorism
are gathering prints and DNA

16:43.420 --> 16:45.219
from ground crew for elimination.

16:45.220 --> 16:46.529
Jack's on it.

16:46.530 --> 16:49.670
Dutch police are doing
the same thing their end.

16:50.030 --> 16:52.209
<i>I'm working on Ezra's phone.</i>

16:52.210 --> 16:54.700
OK, great. Anything else,
let me know, yeah?

16:55.010 --> 16:56.630
- OK.
<i>- Thanks. Bye.</i>

17:32.010 --> 17:34.059
I thought maybe...

17:34.060 --> 17:36.589
..I should identify Jonathan's body.

17:36.590 --> 17:38.560
I could come tomorrow.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.550
Surely the Embassy
can take care of that?

17:52.000 --> 17:54.300
It's Louise.

18:05.790 --> 18:08.440
FOUR DEAD IN PLANE CRASH

18:10.050 --> 18:12.699
<i>We're receiving reports
of a business jet</i>

18:12.700 --> 18:16.009
<i>coming down in woodland a couple
of miles east of Ashwood Airport.</i>

18:16.010 --> 18:19.069
<i>Emergency services have been
on the scene since first light,</i>

18:19.070 --> 18:22.019
<i>and we're still waiting for
more news on the crew</i>

18:22.020 --> 18:24.019
<i>and the three passengers
on board,</i>

18:24.020 --> 18:27.129
<i>one of whom, we've been
informed, is a child.</i>

18:27.130 --> 18:29.530
<i>More on that when we have it.</i>

18:32.800 --> 18:35.380
<i>So the plane comes
down</i> nose-high,

18:35.690 --> 18:39.029
hits the tops of the trees there,
and as it hits the ground,

18:39.030 --> 18:42.229
the rear fuselage
breaks away with Ezra inside.

18:42.230 --> 18:44.520
The impact causes
these deep furrows.

18:45.130 --> 18:46.430
Then what?

18:47.690 --> 18:49.400
This section breaks away.

18:50.010 --> 18:52.289
There's aviation fuel everywhere.

18:52.290 --> 18:55.509
The ATC radar shows
it in a steep dive

18:55.510 --> 18:57.089
before it disappeared,

18:57.090 --> 18:59.669
but there must've been an attempt
to pull the nose up

18:59.670 --> 19:02.159
because the tail of the aircraft
hit the ground first.

19:02.160 --> 19:04.909
The rest of the aircraft
slams into the ground.

19:04.910 --> 19:08.699
It slides another
50 metres further west.

19:08.700 --> 19:13.199
The front of the aircraft separates
and rolls further forward.

19:13.200 --> 19:15.899
The plane comes to rest
in three distinct sections -

19:15.900 --> 19:17.339
we've got the cockpit,

19:17.340 --> 19:20.439
passenger cabin and
the rear fuselage,

19:20.440 --> 19:24.029
the rest of it in woodland on
the east side of the debris field.

19:24.030 --> 19:25.519
And the flames?

19:25.520 --> 19:27.059
Fuel tanks,

19:27.060 --> 19:29.919
ignited by sparks from the fuselage
and the wings, most probably.

19:29.920 --> 19:32.539
Or explosives or incendiaries.

19:32.540 --> 19:34.359
The flight data recorder
should help with that.

19:34.360 --> 19:36.269
Absolutely. We're still
trying to download that.

19:36.270 --> 19:38.129
We've seen no evidence
of blast damage.

19:38.130 --> 19:40.659
It all seems consistent
with ground impact and fire.

19:40.660 --> 19:43.139
So possibly not
a deliberate act.

19:43.140 --> 19:44.449
Is that what we're saying?

19:44.450 --> 19:47.259
Some instrument, mechanical
malfunction? An accident?

19:47.260 --> 19:50.099
All to be investigated further,
but that's the initial picture.

19:50.100 --> 19:54.889
The pilot, Alex Vitarnen,
Caucasian male, aged 32.

19:54.890 --> 19:58.339
Soft tissue loss
over both shoulders and clavicles.

19:58.340 --> 20:01.029
Query seat belt abrasions.

20:01.030 --> 20:04.710
Considerable trauma to
the left side of the head and neck.

20:05.020 --> 20:07.929
Blunt force trauma to the torso.

20:07.930 --> 20:11.029
Patterned abrasion on the chest.

20:11.030 --> 20:13.410
Might represent the steering yoke.

20:22.030 --> 20:23.839
<i>From the position of the bodies,</i>

20:23.840 --> 20:28.289
we think Ezra would've been at
the back left-hand side of the plane

20:28.290 --> 20:31.109
or in the toilet
when the plane went down.

20:31.110 --> 20:34.019
Dad! Dad!
Mum's hurt.

20:34.020 --> 20:37.489
Jonathan Kraft would have
been somewhere here.

20:37.490 --> 20:38.880
Mum!

20:39.800 --> 20:41.100
Miriam Heller...

20:42.010 --> 20:43.469
I don't think she's OK!

20:43.470 --> 20:45.879
..and obviously Alex Vitarnen.

20:45.880 --> 20:48.039
So where was the non-flying guy?

20:48.040 --> 20:49.960
- Rowan Cole.
- Rowan Couve.

20:52.890 --> 20:55.159
The child's seat belt.

20:55.160 --> 20:57.569
- Unfastened, is that right?
- Yes.

20:57.570 --> 21:00.029
- Well, did he leave his seat for some reason?
- Possibly.

21:00.030 --> 21:01.700
Dad!
Help us!

21:03.050 --> 21:04.359
Maybe.

21:04.360 --> 21:06.649
When the nose came
sharply up before impact,

21:06.650 --> 21:10.320
he would have been
thrown against the floor
and backwards to the tail
of the aircraft.

21:12.010 --> 21:15.019
Air traffic control says that,
after the initial dive,

21:15.020 --> 21:17.029
it levelled out for 60 seconds.

21:17.030 --> 21:18.339
Really?

21:18.340 --> 21:20.049
Went into a dive again.

21:20.050 --> 21:23.499
An attempt was made
to pull up at 1,000 feet,

21:23.500 --> 21:26.039
but, by then, it was too late
to rescue the aircraft.

21:26.040 --> 21:27.659
Was autopilot ever engaged?

21:27.660 --> 21:30.650
We'll see. The flight data recorder
should tell us.

21:32.020 --> 21:34.370
Hiya.
Anything?

21:35.000 --> 21:37.299
No obvious signs of
a natural cause of death

21:37.300 --> 21:39.009
that would have led to the crash.

21:39.010 --> 21:41.699
Looks like something got spilt
on his hands and clothing.

21:41.700 --> 21:43.219
Maybe coffee or tea?

21:43.220 --> 21:45.279
You find any cups
on the flight deck?

21:45.280 --> 21:47.419
I'll check the AAIB records,

21:47.420 --> 21:49.029
see what they've catalogued.

21:49.030 --> 21:51.159
- Hi.
- I've got another body,

21:51.160 --> 21:53.059
not directly related
to this but...

21:53.060 --> 21:55.719
Does it have to be now? We've
kind of got our work cut out here.

21:55.720 --> 21:57.659
<i>Of course.
I'm just flagging it up.</i>

21:57.660 --> 21:58.969
Because?

21:58.970 --> 22:02.500
Commander Reed
is asking for you specifically.

22:03.080 --> 22:05.589
OK. Text me the address.
I'm on my way.

22:05.590 --> 22:07.909
You OK to hold the fort
for an hour or so?

22:07.910 --> 22:09.469
I'm needed elsewhere.

22:09.470 --> 22:10.770
Sure.

22:17.050 --> 22:18.350
Peter Sachs.

22:19.030 --> 22:22.139
First impressions,
he's tilted his head back

22:22.140 --> 22:24.309
and shot himself
through the roof of the mouth.

22:24.310 --> 22:26.109
Wife didn't see it coming at all.

22:26.110 --> 22:28.709
Was she here when he did this?

22:28.710 --> 22:30.689
No, she was up in town
for the whole day.

22:30.690 --> 22:32.550
Came back and found him.

22:33.060 --> 22:34.699
You do realise, right,

22:34.700 --> 22:37.069
any pathologist could
have handled this?

22:37.070 --> 22:40.150
Thomas, will you
come with me for a sec?

22:57.040 --> 23:01.409
So there are a couple of possible
connections to the air crash.

23:01.410 --> 23:03.609
We found this

23:03.610 --> 23:06.470
in Peter Sach's browser history.

23:09.020 --> 23:12.699
This group have endorsed
far-right terrorism.

23:12.700 --> 23:15.789
Miriam Heller and Jonathan Kraft
both received death threats.

23:15.790 --> 23:18.279
- From this organisation?
- We're not sure.

23:18.280 --> 23:21.090
It could be a coincidence,
except for this.

23:22.070 --> 23:26.680
Peter Sachs was tracking
the flight Jun0537, and...

23:30.010 --> 23:33.600
..he was tracking it in real time.

23:35.810 --> 23:38.069
Obviously,
we need to check it out,

23:38.070 --> 23:40.729
but we want to keep it under wraps
until we know more.

23:40.730 --> 23:42.210
OK, I'm with you now.

23:47.060 --> 23:49.110
Just the one shot,
I think.

23:50.020 --> 23:52.329
I'll confirm that or
otherwise in postmortem.

23:52.330 --> 23:54.699
Well, we found a single bullet.

23:54.700 --> 23:58.429
Passed through his head
and into the wall.

23:58.430 --> 23:59.999
And the weapon?

24:00.000 --> 24:02.259
1980s handgun,
don't know where he got it from.

24:02.260 --> 24:04.779
The serial number's
been scratched off.

24:04.780 --> 24:07.439
Check for gunshot residue.
Right or left-handed, do we know?

24:07.440 --> 24:09.069
I'll check with the wife.

24:09.070 --> 24:11.810
His wedding ring. Where's that?

24:14.050 --> 24:17.239
Right-handed, yeah.
Is that relevant?

24:17.240 --> 24:21.270
- I think, at this stage...
- Yes, anything might be relevant.

24:22.820 --> 24:24.449
I was at work,

24:24.450 --> 24:27.249
and I got back
and he'd locked the garage door

24:27.250 --> 24:30.029
and the door from the kitchen
through to there,

24:30.030 --> 24:32.049
and he'd put a note on
it saying not to come in

24:32.050 --> 24:33.410
but to call the police.

24:36.030 --> 24:39.850
Siobhan, had he been
low in the past?

24:42.800 --> 24:44.690
He got better.

24:46.000 --> 24:49.339
But then when it came back
this time, the melancholy...

24:49.340 --> 24:53.059
We called it melancholy to try
and take the sting out of it.

24:53.060 --> 24:54.909
It was like...

24:54.910 --> 24:59.069
it was like he needed
to get me to love him for it.

24:59.070 --> 25:01.049
Does that make sense?

25:01.050 --> 25:02.350
Yeah.

25:05.030 --> 25:10.019
And what caused this melancholy?
Was there a reason for it?

25:10.020 --> 25:11.700
His mother, she...

25:12.070 --> 25:14.630
I mean, it's all on file, but...

25:16.030 --> 25:19.939
I suppose, put simply,
you'd say she was abusive,

25:19.940 --> 25:23.459
so he struggled to
make relationships with women,

25:23.460 --> 25:27.550
and when he did,
he said he felt trapped.

25:28.080 --> 25:30.039
By you?

25:30.040 --> 25:31.780
By your marriage?

25:33.020 --> 25:35.079
I'm sorry to ask.

25:35.080 --> 25:38.830
I'm not like his mother,
and I think he...

25:42.050 --> 25:43.980
He had an affair.

25:45.040 --> 25:46.850
A couple of years ago.

25:48.030 --> 25:50.489
He wanted to hurt himself back then,

25:50.490 --> 25:53.400
and I think that was
his way of doing it.

25:54.050 --> 25:57.039
- But you worked it out?
- Yeah, yeah.

25:57.040 --> 25:58.890
We did.

25:59.690 --> 26:02.190
Yeah, we got to the heart of it...

26:03.020 --> 26:04.820
..I thought.

26:08.020 --> 26:09.529
Do you mind me asking,

26:09.530 --> 26:11.850
did he always wear
a wedding ring?

26:14.030 --> 26:15.950
Had he taken it off?

26:18.060 --> 26:20.150
He'd taken it off?!

26:30.010 --> 26:32.490
Peter Sachs, presumed suicide.

26:33.090 --> 26:35.430
Face and head.

26:36.070 --> 26:39.540
Exit wound
to the upper occipital region.

26:40.050 --> 26:41.650
Ragged edging.

26:44.060 --> 26:46.479
Bruising to the lips.

26:46.480 --> 26:48.600
Radial tears around the mouth.

26:52.050 --> 26:54.449
We have multiple parallel linear
scarring

26:54.450 --> 26:56.379
to both inner thighs.

26:56.380 --> 26:58.470
More pronounced on the left.

26:59.070 --> 27:02.259
Appearances of differing ages.

27:02.260 --> 27:05.350
Some scars deep enough
to have been sutured.

27:12.050 --> 27:14.650
Top of the left arm also.

27:17.010 --> 27:18.319
Deliberate.

27:18.320 --> 27:20.390
Consistent with self-harm.

27:28.000 --> 27:31.050
Minimal back spatter
to the dominant hand.

27:34.020 --> 27:36.709
Yeah, and to the left hand, too.

27:36.710 --> 27:38.290
Not unusual.

27:40.190 --> 27:43.350
Hm. Fresh scarring
on the inside of the left wrist.

27:44.070 --> 27:46.339
Like a smiley shape.

27:46.340 --> 27:48.009
Two eyes and an upturned mouth

27:48.010 --> 27:49.990
branded into the skin.

28:45.090 --> 28:48.709
The non-flying pilot - Rowan Cole.

28:48.710 --> 28:51.029
Aged 52.

28:51.030 --> 28:52.799
Multiple injuries.

28:52.800 --> 28:57.629
Lacerations and extensive bruising
to the torso and the head.

28:57.630 --> 29:00.319
No marks of external damage
to the neck or shoulders.

29:00.320 --> 29:01.979
No seat belt abrasions,

29:01.980 --> 29:04.179
unlike the pilot Alex Vitarnen.

29:04.180 --> 29:08.010
Right leg, traumatic amputation
below the knee.

29:08.800 --> 29:11.339
No signs of explosive
damage to the body.

29:11.340 --> 29:14.749
Right hand,
fractured thumb and wrist.

29:14.750 --> 29:17.410
Tears to the palms.
Same on the left hand.

29:19.040 --> 29:21.039
We have marks here.

29:21.040 --> 29:22.349
Burns.

29:22.350 --> 29:24.249
Two eyes and a smiley face.

29:24.250 --> 29:27.309
I think made by a cigarette
lighter held to the skin.

29:27.310 --> 29:29.029
Really?

29:29.030 --> 29:31.880
I found the same marks on the
suicide victim - Peter Sachs.

29:35.070 --> 29:36.700
DI Rosen.

29:37.020 --> 29:39.319
Hi.
It's Thomas Chamberlain.

29:39.320 --> 29:41.009
Look,
I thought you should know,

29:41.010 --> 29:43.929
both Peter Sachs and
the non-flying pilot Rowan Cole

29:43.930 --> 29:45.939
have identical cigarette
lighter burns

29:45.940 --> 29:48.869
<i>- to the inside of their left wrists.</i>
- So not a coincidence, then?

29:48.870 --> 29:50.659
It'd be extraordinary if it was.

29:50.660 --> 29:53.419
I don't know what it means, but it's
another connection between them.

29:53.420 --> 29:55.829
<i>- Do you think they knew each other?</i>
- Not that we're aware of.

29:55.830 --> 29:58.329
There's nothing <i>concrete
to confirm tha</i> t.

29:58.330 --> 29:59.920
Maybe there is now.

30:30.110 --> 30:35.010
"Ther was an innocent child.
My doing. Want it to end."

30:38.100 --> 30:40.400
"Where ans when?"

31:26.670 --> 31:28.760
Hi.
What's going on?

31:30.040 --> 31:32.959
Louise can't face
coming over here on her own.

31:32.960 --> 31:35.969
Charlie's flying to Washington
to be with her, so...

31:35.970 --> 31:39.359
She's asked me
to identify Jonathan's body.

31:39.360 --> 31:42.050
- Matt...
- It's what I'd like to do.

31:43.050 --> 31:44.350
No.

31:46.010 --> 31:48.299
- I promised I would.
- And I said no.

31:48.300 --> 31:51.029
This isn't going to be
a straightforward ID.

31:51.030 --> 31:54.140
We're going to have to rely on
dental records and DNA.

31:55.050 --> 31:57.490
It's not for anybody who loved him.

32:03.000 --> 32:05.029
Come on.

32:05.030 --> 32:06.740
Let's get out of here.

32:08.040 --> 32:09.640
I'll get my stuff.

32:22.920 --> 32:25.019
<i>If it wasn't for Jonathan
bringing me over here</i>

32:25.020 --> 32:26.329
<i>to run the Embassy,</i>

32:26.330 --> 32:28.230
<i>you and I never would have met.</i>

32:31.040 --> 32:32.859
Thank you, Jonathan.

32:32.860 --> 32:35.590
Thank you, my friend.

32:41.080 --> 32:42.810
God, this...

32:45.010 --> 32:47.650
..this sort of thing kind of
brings up some stuff, huh?

32:48.010 --> 32:49.310
Like what?

32:55.050 --> 32:57.530
You know, the conference
in Amsterdam...

32:59.030 --> 33:01.119
..Jonathan was talking about Syria,

33:01.120 --> 33:05.079
and we were there for
a couple of years, 2016,

33:05.080 --> 33:07.450
on a diplomatic assignment

33:08.030 --> 33:10.290
cos I know a lot about Syria...

33:11.790 --> 33:13.290
..and...

33:15.490 --> 33:17.600
..that's why I was...

33:20.040 --> 33:21.890
Why you were...?

33:29.020 --> 33:32.659
Let's go somewhere else, no?
I want to go somewhere else.

33:32.660 --> 33:34.360
Let's go.

33:46.020 --> 33:47.459
What else have you got?

33:47.460 --> 33:49.219
London air traffic control

33:49.220 --> 33:50.829
tried to communicate
with the aircraft,

33:50.830 --> 33:52.139
but there was no response.

33:52.140 --> 33:55.039
Is this after the aircraft's
initial dive or before?

33:55.040 --> 33:56.349
Before.

33:56.350 --> 33:58.249
There was no response
from Alex Vitarnen,

33:58.250 --> 33:59.559
so my question is,

33:59.560 --> 34:02.389
is there anything from his
postmortem that could explain that?

34:02.390 --> 34:05.609
We're still waiting on toxicology,
but, so far, no.

34:05.610 --> 34:07.399
What about the Peter Sachs case?

34:07.400 --> 34:09.458
Clarissa,
anything on that gun?

34:09.460 --> 34:12.290
The exhibits officer
is processing it.

34:13.020 --> 34:14.440
Paperwork, eh?

34:41.040 --> 34:43.759
<i>The UN's talking about
getting refugees back,</i>

34:43.760 --> 34:46.549
<i>but there's no water,
no electricity, no work.</i>

34:46.550 --> 34:48.208
<i>There's nothing to go home to.</i>

34:48.210 --> 34:51.659
<i>So we should focus on
basic infrastructure</i>

34:51.659 --> 34:55.708
<i>before we talk about
moving people back in numbers or...</i>

34:55.710 --> 34:57.599
<i>If we can get other countries
to do that, then...</i>

34:57.600 --> 34:59.809
This is before the first
loss of altitude?

34:59.810 --> 35:02.109
Yeah.
I've time-coded it.

35:02.110 --> 35:04.089
<i>So you want to come
see the flight deck?</i>

35:04.090 --> 35:05.430
<i>Can I, Mum?</i>

35:09.030 --> 35:11.719
There are other files,
but they're corrupted,

35:11.720 --> 35:13.400
except...

35:29.070 --> 35:31.590
<i>Ezra!
Ezra, are you OK?!</i>

35:42.050 --> 35:43.650
So...

35:45.010 --> 35:48.369
..where was the non-flying pilot
during that?

35:48.370 --> 35:50.069
Flight deck?

35:50.070 --> 35:53.029
Alex Vitarnen
had seat harness burns,

35:53.030 --> 35:55.409
shoulder and collar bones,
but Rowan Cole didn't.

35:55.410 --> 35:58.469
So Cole was, what, on the flight
deck but not buckled in,

35:58.470 --> 36:00.509
or back in the passenger cabin?

36:00.510 --> 36:03.039
Is his voice on
the cockpit voice recorder?

36:03.040 --> 36:05.459
No, nor Alex Vitarnen's,

36:05.460 --> 36:08.279
not for the last
22 minutes of the flight.

36:08.280 --> 36:11.010
Here.
This is what it picked up.

36:12.080 --> 36:14.670
<i>Hey, everything all right?</i>

36:15.010 --> 36:17.100
<i>Hey!
Open that door!</i>

36:19.090 --> 36:21.069
<i>What's going on?!</i>

36:21.070 --> 36:25.290
<i>100, 500, 1,000, 2,500.</i>

36:26.090 --> 36:29.019
<i>Jun0537, London centre.
Climb immediately.</i>

36:29.020 --> 36:30.329
Repeat, immediately.

36:30.330 --> 36:35.220
Pull up!
Pull up!

36:41.080 --> 36:45.019
I've been running toxicology
on the coffee.

36:45.020 --> 36:48.169
The results, there's caffeine,

36:48.170 --> 36:50.329
and this is what's
really important -

36:50.330 --> 36:52.149
benzodiazepine.

36:52.150 --> 36:54.789
- OK.
- I don't understand.

36:54.790 --> 36:56.409
It's a class of drug

36:56.410 --> 36:59.719
used to treat a variety of
conditions including seizures.

36:59.720 --> 37:01.079
And anxiety.

37:01.080 --> 37:02.990
I'll see if his bloods are in yet.

37:07.060 --> 37:10.319
Yes, it was present
in his blood sample.

37:10.320 --> 37:12.609
0.3 milligrammes per litre.

37:12.610 --> 37:15.219
That's enough to sedate him,
maybe even knock him out.

37:15.220 --> 37:17.119
OK. OK. Thank you.

37:17.120 --> 37:19.709
Alex Vitarnen's not registered
with a GP in the UK,

37:19.710 --> 37:22.169
and his doctor in Finland
has no record of him

37:22.170 --> 37:23.979
being prescribed
anything regularly.

37:23.980 --> 37:25.629
Never a benzodiazepine.

37:25.630 --> 37:27.259
You can buy them on
the street easily enough.

37:27.260 --> 37:30.119
He was anxious so he bought
meds on the street to treat it?

37:30.120 --> 37:32.379
They wouldn't show up
on his medical records that way.

37:32.380 --> 37:35.219
And, what, he took them on
the flight, got the dosage wrong?

37:35.220 --> 37:36.989
Maybe. All we
can say for sure

37:36.990 --> 37:39.279
is that he took
enough medication,

37:39.280 --> 37:41.619
whether by accident or design.

37:41.620 --> 37:42.920
Sorry.

37:45.000 --> 37:46.300
How you feeling?

37:47.020 --> 37:48.990
I have to go back Washington.

37:49.700 --> 37:51.449
- When?
<i>- Today.</i>

37:51.450 --> 37:53.219
My flight's in four hours.

37:53.220 --> 37:56.580
- Really?
- Yeah. I don't want to, but I have to.

37:57.040 --> 37:58.750
Are you OK?

38:01.020 --> 38:02.320
Yeah.

38:03.080 --> 38:06.449
My taxi's here, though.
I better go.

38:06.450 --> 38:08.450
I'll call you when I land.

38:19.000 --> 38:20.379
These came from the galley.

38:20.380 --> 38:22.389
Right. Are these
the same kind of mugs

38:22.390 --> 38:24.699
that the pilot Alex drank from
on the flight deck?

38:24.700 --> 38:26.089
- Yes.
- OK.

38:26.090 --> 38:30.649
He didn't leave the flight deck.
Are we 100% sure of that?

38:30.650 --> 38:32.989
There's nothing
on the CVR to suggest it,

38:32.990 --> 38:35.919
and autopilot
wasn't engaged at any time,

38:35.920 --> 38:38.529
and Rowan Cole wasn't
cleared to fly this trip,

38:38.530 --> 38:41.920
so, yeah, Alex would have
had to stay on deck.

38:44.040 --> 38:45.679
Now, then.

38:45.680 --> 38:47.459
The coffee.

38:47.460 --> 38:50.539
That was stored somewhere
in the passenger cabin, wasn't it?

38:50.540 --> 38:52.899
No, the cups and mugs and coffee
were all stored in the galley

38:52.900 --> 38:55.420
- at the rear of the aircraft.
- I see.

38:56.400 --> 38:59.669
<i>Before we talk about
moving people back in numbers or...</i>

38:59.670 --> 39:02.259
<i>If we can get
other countries to do that,</i>

39:02.260 --> 39:04.619
<i>and that's a big if,
there's this massive tussle</i>

39:04.620 --> 39:07.069
<i>between what's politically
expedient and...</i>

39:07.070 --> 39:09.929
<i>- And what's morally right.
- Absolutely.</i>

39:09.930 --> 39:11.709
<i>So you want to come see
the flight deck?</i>

39:11.710 --> 39:13.010
<i>Can I, Mum?</i>

39:15.010 --> 39:19.029
Right. What if Rowan Cole
laced the drink,

39:19.030 --> 39:22.009
closed and locked the door
of the flight deck,

39:22.010 --> 39:23.660
just him and Alex in there...

39:25.010 --> 39:26.939
..and one drugged coffee.

39:26.940 --> 39:28.640
Now, why would a man do that?

39:36.690 --> 39:38.040
You all right?

39:41.000 --> 39:42.309
Hiya, Mum.

39:42.310 --> 39:43.720
Where've you been?

39:44.080 --> 39:47.289
- You know where we've been.
- I've been worried out my mind.

39:47.290 --> 39:49.209
Don't do this again.

39:49.210 --> 39:51.459
- Every time.
- Go to your room, darling.

39:51.460 --> 39:54.419
Everything I do. You know
I was just taking her climbing.

39:54.420 --> 39:55.729
Not till this time.

39:55.730 --> 39:57.849
Just pick up the phone,
that's all you've got to do.

39:57.850 --> 39:59.719
I can't even walk in my own home
without all this.

39:59.720 --> 40:02.560
Just pick up the phone, Kyle.
Communicate!

40:06.010 --> 40:07.310
Go to your room.

40:08.040 --> 40:10.259
It's all right, darling.
Listen to your mum.

40:10.260 --> 40:11.560
Go to your room.

40:22.070 --> 40:23.370
Say it.

40:25.090 --> 40:27.169
Say it's my fault.

40:27.170 --> 40:28.470
Say it.

40:31.050 --> 40:34.099
Tommy's not here any more
and he's never coming back.

40:34.100 --> 40:36.679
His dad's responsible, yeah?

40:36.680 --> 40:38.200
That's what you think?

40:39.040 --> 40:41.389
You don't even trust me
with Ella any more.

40:41.390 --> 40:43.449
10 minutes late and you're already
pulling out your hair.

40:43.450 --> 40:45.529
What do you think I'm going
to do - hurt her?

40:45.530 --> 40:47.589
Cos I'm a killer?
Is that what you think?

40:47.590 --> 40:48.909
Go on, say it.
Is that what you think?!

40:48.910 --> 40:50.210
Yes.

40:50.640 --> 40:52.130
That's what I think.

40:53.030 --> 40:55.010
It's exactly what I think.

40:56.060 --> 40:58.520
You don't know how right you are.

40:59.070 --> 41:01.579
You don't know the half
of what I've done.

41:01.580 --> 41:03.370
What are you talking about?

41:04.070 --> 41:06.210
You don't want me here, do you?

41:06.700 --> 41:09.459
Just be honest, Kate.
You might as well carry on.

41:09.460 --> 41:12.550
All right.
Do I want you here?

41:14.010 --> 41:15.610
Not like this.

41:16.020 --> 41:17.519
No.

41:17.520 --> 41:18.820
Right.

41:19.810 --> 41:21.410
Then I'll go.

41:25.000 --> 41:26.590
I'll find somewhere else.

41:40.070 --> 41:42.090
What are you looking at, darling?

41:42.700 --> 41:45.320
Nothing.
Just outside.

41:46.060 --> 41:48.530
Why don't you
come downstairs for dinner now?

41:58.010 --> 41:59.419
I'm here.

41:59.420 --> 42:00.899
All right?

42:00.900 --> 42:02.850
Dad'll be OK.

42:54.020 --> 42:56.039
<i>Hi, this is Matt.
I can't get to the phone.</i>

42:56.040 --> 42:57.579
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

42:57.580 --> 43:00.819
Matt, please, will you give me
a call when you get this?

43:00.820 --> 43:02.350
Let me know you're OK.

43:08.770 --> 43:11.009
So none of this can be proved.

43:11.010 --> 43:14.009
All we know is that
Rowan Cole made coffee.

43:14.010 --> 43:17.249
We don't actually know where
he was when the plane came down.

43:17.250 --> 43:20.550
He may have been on the flight deck
or he might not.

43:21.010 --> 43:25.249
Toxicology's confirmed that neither
Alex Vitarnen or Rowan Cole

43:25.250 --> 43:27.389
were affected by an
excess of carbon monoxide

43:27.390 --> 43:28.999
or any other toxic gas,

43:29.000 --> 43:32.959
and no other victim had
benzodiazepine in their systems.

43:32.960 --> 43:36.909
So Alex Vitarnen could've been
in and out of consciousness,

43:36.910 --> 43:40.819
lost control of the aircraft,
then wrestled to get it back.

43:40.820 --> 43:43.029
I don't think Alex
left the flight deck.

43:43.030 --> 43:47.379
But we know the non-flying
pilot Rowan Cole did,

43:47.380 --> 43:49.029
and he brought the coffee with him.

43:49.030 --> 43:53.280
So say for a minute
he spiked the coffee in the kitchen.

43:53.610 --> 43:56.719
He goes through with the kid
to the flight deck,

43:56.720 --> 43:59.549
gives Alex the coffee,
and he returns the kid to his seat.

43:59.550 --> 44:01.959
On his way back...
he closes and locks the door.

44:01.960 --> 44:03.769
- Excuse me.
- Why would he do that?

44:03.770 --> 44:06.370
Because Jonathan Kraft
was a far-right target.

44:08.880 --> 44:11.049
Sorry, that was my team.

44:11.050 --> 44:14.900
Rowan Cole was seeing
a psychotherapist.

44:23.010 --> 44:25.180
I saw reports of the crash online,

44:26.420 --> 44:28.430
but they didn't mention
Rowan's name.

44:30.030 --> 44:32.119
He was a private client.

44:32.120 --> 44:34.010
What was he depressed about?

44:36.010 --> 44:38.499
This is an ongoing investigation.

44:38.500 --> 44:42.089
No need to worry about
patient confidentiality.

44:42.090 --> 44:46.479
Did something trigger
his depression?

44:46.480 --> 44:48.650
No single incident, no.

44:50.000 --> 44:51.800
What can I tell you?

44:52.600 --> 44:54.259
He lived alone.

44:54.260 --> 44:57.339
Was never married,
never had a partner, no children.

44:57.340 --> 45:01.079
He'd spent most of his working life
flying around the world.

45:01.080 --> 45:04.259
Living out of hotels
so he had no roots.

45:04.260 --> 45:06.380
Nowhere he felt he belonged,

45:07.030 --> 45:09.419
and the thing that
he did have, his job,

45:09.420 --> 45:13.050
was under threat
because of his mental health.

45:14.020 --> 45:16.059
He didn't report that.

45:16.060 --> 45:20.200
Did you report the state of his
mental health to the authorities?

45:21.020 --> 45:22.329
No.

45:22.330 --> 45:25.029
I'm not medically trained, so,

45:25.030 --> 45:28.209
unfortunately, they wouldn't
take my word for it if I did.

45:28.210 --> 45:31.350
- So you don't prescribe medication?
- No.

45:32.020 --> 45:33.450
That's a psychiatrist.

45:35.030 --> 45:39.150
Did he express
suicidal thoughts to you?

45:40.070 --> 45:41.880
Not to me.

45:48.090 --> 45:52.670
Rowan was driven
more by anger than despair.

45:53.400 --> 45:56.049
Mostly at live news updates
on his phone

45:56.050 --> 45:59.009
that he'd get just to
have something to rail at,

45:59.010 --> 46:02.439
something other than what he
perceived to be his own inadequacies.

46:02.440 --> 46:04.520
- Friends?
- No.

46:06.060 --> 46:09.450
He was entirely disconnected.

46:10.050 --> 46:11.790
Isolated.

46:13.070 --> 46:15.500
Like I said, news and politics.

46:15.810 --> 46:19.039
That was the limit of
his regular conversation.

46:19.040 --> 46:23.179
And where would you place him
on the political spectrum?

46:23.180 --> 46:24.890
Right-wing.

46:26.020 --> 46:28.489
- Quite definitely.
- Right-wing how?

46:28.490 --> 46:30.660
Attila the Hun right-wing?

46:31.020 --> 46:33.109
Mussolini right-wing?

46:33.110 --> 46:35.029
It's nothing to be flippant about.

46:35.030 --> 46:38.219
I am not being flippant.

46:38.220 --> 46:40.029
No.

46:40.030 --> 46:41.420
I mean...

46:42.030 --> 46:45.250
Some men don't have clear
societal roles any more.

46:47.810 --> 46:50.080
They feel that they're
no longer listened to...

46:51.800 --> 46:56.309
..which leads them sometimes
into extreme associations

46:56.310 --> 46:59.290
or extreme behaviour.

47:00.070 --> 47:02.270
That anger has to go somewhere.

47:03.050 --> 47:06.580
Sometimes it's directed inwards,
an impulse to self-destruct,

47:07.720 --> 47:10.250
and other times
they look for others like them.

47:10.610 --> 47:12.309
They look outwards.

47:12.310 --> 47:14.199
Online, maybe?

47:14.200 --> 47:17.039
- Yes.
- Did Rowan Cole do that?

47:17.040 --> 47:20.619
- Did he look for others online?
- I believe so.

47:20.620 --> 47:24.370
From the things that he said,
groups he associated with, yes.

47:28.030 --> 47:31.880
Men like Rowan can be easy prey
for extremists.

47:32.380 --> 47:34.869
They're the rallying point
for that anger.

47:34.870 --> 47:36.829
They stoke it and
give it direction.

47:36.830 --> 47:40.809
And that anger, specifically
in terms of Rowan Cole

47:40.810 --> 47:43.479
and your sessions with him,

47:43.480 --> 47:46.090
that anger was aimed at...

47:47.040 --> 47:48.860
..politicians?

47:52.070 --> 47:53.370
Yes.

49:49.080 --> 49:52.999
You OK?
You're not knackered?

49:53.000 --> 49:55.650
- We were out late.
- That's not like you.

49:56.070 --> 49:58.189
Matt's struggling a bit.

49:58.190 --> 50:01.039
- Jonathan.
- Yeah.

50:01.040 --> 50:03.170
I can't seem to help him.

50:04.040 --> 50:05.659
Alprazolam.

50:05.660 --> 50:09.740
The type of benzodiazepine in
the coffee Alex Vitarnen drank.

50:10.050 --> 50:11.890
It's Alprazolam.

50:33.080 --> 50:36.350
Rowan Cole.
Let's see.

50:37.070 --> 50:39.730
Browser history deleted.

50:41.030 --> 50:43.800
Shall we check out the slack space?

51:03.010 --> 51:06.369
We've managed to recover some
of Rowan Cole's browsing history.

51:06.370 --> 51:08.250
Sorry.

51:11.260 --> 51:13.280
Hey.
Where are you?

51:14.700 --> 51:17.950
I haven't been
completely honest with you.

51:19.380 --> 51:21.190
About what?

51:21.550 --> 51:23.210
Not honest how?

51:24.910 --> 51:26.979
I don't know. I just feel like
I'm in the way.

51:26.980 --> 51:29.149
What are you talking about?

51:29.150 --> 51:32.099
<i>You know, our thing is supposed
to be fun and easy.</i>

51:32.100 --> 51:34.059
I don't know. Maybe I just need
some time to myself.

51:34.060 --> 51:35.849
I need some time to think...

51:35.850 --> 51:38.029
Look,
I understand you're upset,

51:38.030 --> 51:40.419
but please, don't take
this out on me. On us.

51:40.420 --> 51:41.879
<i>That's not fair.</i>

51:41.880 --> 51:45.029
- I'll call you when I get home.
- What do you mean? Are you...?

51:45.030 --> 51:47.139
They're boarding the plane.
I have to go.

51:47.140 --> 51:49.920
I'II... I'll call you
when I get home.

51:51.560 --> 51:52.860
Matt?

52:14.020 --> 52:16.229
<i>Hi, this is Matt.
I can't get to the phone.</i>

52:16.230 --> 52:17.750
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

52:31.070 --> 52:33.679
So we have a drugged pilot

52:33.680 --> 52:37.229
and a second pilot suspected of
spiking his coffee, hm?

52:37.230 --> 52:39.289
After which he takes control
of the aircraft

52:39.290 --> 52:41.529
in order to murder
a former US Ambassador.

52:41.530 --> 52:43.629
- I don't know.
- Plus, we have online activity

52:43.630 --> 52:44.939
linking the two events

52:44.940 --> 52:47.149
and matching burns,
deliberately administered,

52:47.150 --> 52:49.019
to both Sachs' and Cole's bodies.

52:49.020 --> 52:50.949
OK, but there's this, too.

52:50.950 --> 52:52.999
I think this is
massively significant.

52:53.000 --> 52:55.909
It's also from Rowan Cole's
search history.

52:55.910 --> 52:57.850
Somewhere he spent a lot of time.

53:00.050 --> 53:02.019
It's a chatroom

53:02.020 --> 53:05.069
for people who
struggle with suicidal thoughts.

53:05.070 --> 53:06.379
How many people are on here?

53:06.380 --> 53:09.239
Looks like about a dozen regulars
who come and go.

53:09.240 --> 53:11.009
They talk about
wanting to end their lives.

53:11.010 --> 53:15.089
Not using their real names.
Cole's posting as Ridley33.

53:15.090 --> 53:17.000
So these are all handles?

53:19.010 --> 53:21.899
- Manfred068?
- Yeah.

53:21.900 --> 53:24.500
Manfred is a frequent poster.

53:25.010 --> 53:27.459
"It is not seen as insane

53:27.460 --> 53:30.189
"when a fighter,
under an attack

53:30.190 --> 53:32.649
"that will inevitably
lead to his death,

53:32.650 --> 53:35.269
"chooses to take his own life.

53:35.270 --> 53:37.189
"How is it any different

53:37.190 --> 53:41.069
"when you are under
attack by your own mind?"

53:41.070 --> 53:44.420
So he's not just supporting them.

53:45.030 --> 53:46.729
He's actually encouraging them

53:46.730 --> 53:48.439
to take their
own lives.

53:48.440 --> 53:50.529
Desperate men
looking for someone to trust,

53:50.530 --> 53:53.820
and he's preying on them.

54:24.040 --> 54:26.449
Can we scroll back
to the conversations

54:26.450 --> 54:29.000
- before the plane came down?
- Sure.

54:36.030 --> 54:39.029
Yeah, around here.
It's Rowan Cole.

54:39.030 --> 54:43.600
"I want to knock myself out
and let my aircraft take me."

54:46.030 --> 54:49.880
- "Do it. Stop hurting."
- "With you."

54:51.080 --> 54:53.690
This is incitement to suicide.

54:54.050 --> 54:56.089
Can't the police stop it?

54:56.090 --> 54:58.099
Just shut it down!

54:58.100 --> 55:00.729
We shut one site down
and another one pops up,

55:00.730 --> 55:03.039
and the online filters
just can't catch everything.

55:03.040 --> 55:06.759
And if you close
this chatroom, that's it.

55:06.760 --> 55:08.919
We'll never be able
to trace them, and

55:08.920 --> 55:11.090
we need to track this guy down.

55:11.710 --> 55:14.050
So who is Manfred?

55:17.010 --> 55:19.689
<i>More details have emerged
of the passengers onboard</i>

55:19.690 --> 55:23.199
<i>the Juno Airlines flight which
crashed near Ashwood Airport.</i>

55:23.200 --> 55:24.729
<i>One of them, Jonathan Kraft,</i>

55:24.730 --> 55:26.879
<i>was the US ambassador to the UK</i>

55:26.880 --> 55:28.839
<i>during the time of President Obama.</i>

55:28.840 --> 55:31.229
<i>He and his fellow passenger,
Miriam Heller,</i>

55:31.230 --> 55:33.849
<i>were both killed.
The third passenger,</i>

55:33.850 --> 55:36.709
<i>Mrs. Heller's
11-year-old son, is in hospital.</i>

55:36.710 --> 55:39.650
<i>His condition
is said to be critical.</i>

55:54.110 --> 55:56.290
You think it's a good thing
he killed himself?

56:02.680 --> 56:04.009
Police, please!

56:04.010 --> 56:05.310
<i>Manfred's on the move.</i>

56:06.320 --> 56:10.810
People struggle and people recover.

56:28.380 --> 56:30.649
<i>Hi, this is Matt.
I can't get to the phone.</i>

56:30.650 --> 56:32.129
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

56:32.130 --> 56:35.030
<i>Matt, please let me know
you're OK.</i>
