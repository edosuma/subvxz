WEBVTT

00:07.507 --> 00:10.885
Now, be kind.
I've had this place forever.

00:10.969 --> 00:14.222
Buyers love a classic
old brownstone,

00:14.305 --> 00:16.433
and I can light
a few Diptyques

00:16.516 --> 00:17.851
to cover that classic
old brownstone smell.

00:17.934 --> 00:21.354
Seema, this is
just me showing you

00:21.438 --> 00:23.898
where I've been staying,
since you asked.

00:23.982 --> 00:27.777
-It's not about a sale.
-Seema: Everything is
about a sale.

00:28.862 --> 00:30.530
-Carrie: Ooh.
-What the hell are you doing?

00:30.613 --> 00:32.115
Oh, it's just my lower back.

00:32.198 --> 00:35.702
Sometimes, I need a little
help getting up the stairs.

00:35.785 --> 00:36.870
A little help?

00:36.953 --> 00:39.164
You're using
an umbrella as a cane.

00:40.999 --> 00:45.170
The internet says
I have "old lady back."

00:45.253 --> 00:50.175
The internet is for perverts.
What does your orthopedist say?

00:50.258 --> 00:52.260
Ohh...

00:52.343 --> 00:55.930
-you know I don't
have one of those.
-Well, now you do.

00:56.014 --> 00:57.474
Let me call
my cousin's office,

00:57.557 --> 00:58.391
and get you
an appointment
later today.

00:58.475 --> 00:59.934
Oh, no, no, please
don't go to any trouble

01:00.018 --> 01:03.188
over my completely
common senior condition.

01:03.271 --> 01:07.066
Nonsense. You're not old,
and Vik doesn't have anything

01:07.150 --> 01:09.944
he can't move to get you in.

01:10.028 --> 01:12.113
-Charming.
-Thank you.

01:12.197 --> 01:13.823
I can have a crew here
to take care of that tomorrow.

01:13.907 --> 01:17.577
-Oh.
-Seema: Hi, my darling,
it's Seema.

01:17.660 --> 01:20.121
Does Vikash have any time
in the next couple of hours

01:20.205 --> 01:22.791
to see my friend
about her sore back?

01:22.874 --> 01:24.042
No, it's not an emergency,

01:24.125 --> 01:26.795
but she does need
to be seen immediately,

01:26.878 --> 01:29.005
preferably before 3:00.
I have a showing.

01:29.088 --> 01:30.965
Seema, there is
no urgency to this

01:31.049 --> 01:32.133
'cause, 'cause I,
actually, I,

01:32.217 --> 01:37.263
I bought these very fancy
patches that I saw on TV.

01:37.347 --> 01:38.848
They heat up when
you stick them on.

01:38.932 --> 01:40.183
They're like magic,
back magic.

01:40.266 --> 01:45.563
Thank you so much, Jessie.
We'll see you soon. Bye.

01:45.647 --> 01:48.399
I should hire you to be
in charge of my entire life.

01:48.483 --> 01:49.818
I know you're joking
but, honestly,

01:49.901 --> 01:51.569
you could use some help.

01:51.653 --> 01:53.071
Chop-chop, grandma.
Vik will see you in an hour.

01:58.076 --> 02:00.203
See, it's magic.

02:00.286 --> 02:01.371
(Seema snorts)

02:04.415 --> 02:06.084
Oh, ow, oh wow.

02:07.919 --> 02:10.672
Okay, I'm here.
How we doin'?

02:10.755 --> 02:12.131
What on earth
took you so long?

02:12.215 --> 02:14.801
The technician
took her X-rays like
half an hour ago.

02:14.884 --> 02:16.761
Um... I'm fine.
Thank you for asking.

02:16.845 --> 02:20.306
Hiya, Carrie.
I'm Vikash.

02:20.390 --> 02:22.517
I'm sure Seema gave you
my entire resume,

02:22.600 --> 02:24.018
and dating history
in the car on the way,

02:24.102 --> 02:28.314
so I won't bother you
with a formal introduction.

02:28.398 --> 02:30.149
Well, it's very nice
to meet you, Dr. Patel.

02:30.233 --> 02:33.361
So, my colleague, Dr. Wilson,
and I looked at your films--

02:33.444 --> 02:34.404
It's arthritis, right?

02:34.487 --> 02:35.238
I have old lady disease
in my back.

02:35.321 --> 02:37.031
That's what
the internet told me.

02:37.115 --> 02:39.033
I am sorry if
my medical degree

02:39.117 --> 02:40.910
contradicts
Google's algorithm,

02:40.994 --> 02:42.078
but I think...

02:43.705 --> 02:47.375
Well, I'm not a doctor,
but, uh, that's not my back.

02:47.458 --> 02:48.543
Wait for it.

02:50.420 --> 02:52.505
It's your hip.

02:52.589 --> 02:54.424
You have an undiagnosed
congenital birth defect.

02:54.507 --> 02:56.885
-I do?
-Dr. Patel: But it's something
I can fix surgically,

02:56.968 --> 02:59.053
and get you back
on your feet in no time.

03:01.180 --> 03:01.890
I'm not an old lady!

03:01.973 --> 03:06.060
I have a congenital
hip defect.

03:06.144 --> 03:07.937
But you are having
hip surgery,

03:08.021 --> 03:10.356
so it's, it's
kind of an old thing.

03:10.440 --> 03:11.858
Yeah, hip as
an adjective is young,

03:11.941 --> 03:13.860
but hip as a noun
is kinda old.

03:13.943 --> 03:15.320
If we're being honest,
using hip as an adjective

03:15.403 --> 03:18.698
is knock-knock-knockin'
on the nursin' home door, too.

03:18.781 --> 03:21.910
-I am no longer
paying for lunch.
-Come on.

03:21.993 --> 03:24.579
We are thrilled that you
found an archaeologist

03:24.662 --> 03:26.122
to saw your old
carcass open,

03:26.205 --> 03:28.541
and try to put those
sanded-down fossils

03:28.625 --> 03:29.667
-inside you back together
-Anthony!

03:29.751 --> 03:32.253
What?! She laughed.

03:32.337 --> 03:34.631
And this is my first solo
lunch with you ladies.

03:34.714 --> 03:35.256
I've really gotta bring it.

03:35.340 --> 03:37.342
This calls for champagne.

03:37.425 --> 03:41.930
-Miranda, it, it
isn't even 12:30.
-We're celebrating.

03:42.013 --> 03:45.391
Anthony is here,
and Carrie is not old.

03:45.475 --> 03:45.850
Carrie:
No, I'm not,

03:45.934 --> 03:47.185
and Dr. Patel said

03:47.268 --> 03:50.146
he couldn't believe
I was still up and walking,

03:50.229 --> 03:52.732
and after these last
two months, neither can I.

03:52.815 --> 03:55.318
So, I have started
an Excel spreadsheet,

03:55.401 --> 03:57.153
so that we can all
take turns helping out

03:57.236 --> 03:58.947
with Carrie's recovery
post-surgery.

03:59.030 --> 04:00.782
You guys, this is
so nice, truly,

04:00.865 --> 04:02.617
and if it's too much,
you know, I can,

04:02.700 --> 04:03.910
I can always
hire a nurse.

04:03.993 --> 04:06.287
I just... I just
don't wanna be alone.

04:06.371 --> 04:08.414
-You won't be alone.
-We're here for you.

04:08.498 --> 04:09.332
I'm not changin'
any bedpans.

04:09.415 --> 04:14.087
I would rather die
than show you my pee.

04:14.170 --> 04:16.381
Okay... They say

04:16.464 --> 04:17.966
that Carrie
will be on crutches

04:18.049 --> 04:18.967
for two to three weeks,

04:19.050 --> 04:23.012
and then,
six to eight weeks PT,

04:23.096 --> 04:24.305
and then, full recovery
in a few months.

04:24.389 --> 04:28.059
-But no strenuous exercise.
-Not a problem.

04:28.142 --> 04:30.269
-And no heels.
-Problem.

04:30.353 --> 04:31.062
Do you even
own a flat shoe?

04:31.145 --> 04:37.652
Yes, I bought a pair
of Toms in 2007.

04:37.735 --> 04:42.281
But that was...
just because it made me
feel like a good person.

04:42.365 --> 04:43.825
Miranda: Aw.

04:43.908 --> 04:45.827
So, we're all set
for the entire class

04:45.910 --> 04:48.621
to go to MoMA PS1
to see the James Turrell?

04:48.705 --> 04:50.164
Yes, we are.
I collected all

04:50.248 --> 04:51.749
the permission slips
and fees,

04:51.833 --> 04:54.460
and I think Ainsley took care
of the charter bus.

04:54.544 --> 04:56.838
I did, even got us a discount.

04:56.921 --> 04:58.840
Great!
Does anyone have anything else

04:58.923 --> 05:00.216
before we break for this week?

05:00.299 --> 05:03.052
-Veronica.
-Uh, n-nothing official.

05:03.136 --> 05:05.596
Just wanted to say
how funny Rock was
in the school play.

05:05.680 --> 05:08.975
Oh my goodness.
Yes, Rock, yes!

05:09.058 --> 05:09.726
Oh, Rock was
a total rock star--

05:09.809 --> 05:13.187
Wait, Wait,
who's Rock?

05:13.271 --> 05:14.897
Did-did I somehow
miss a new kid?

05:14.981 --> 05:16.899
No, Rock your--

05:19.777 --> 05:21.529
Charlotte:
Did everyone just freeze?

05:21.612 --> 05:23.573
Okay, ladies,
we're done here, right?
Talk soon.

05:23.656 --> 05:25.616
Charlotte, I'm gonna
call you right now.

05:31.205 --> 05:33.791
-Okay.
-(phone ringing)

05:33.875 --> 05:35.168
-Hello?
-Lisa (on phone): It's me.

05:35.251 --> 05:36.711
I, I assumed you knew.

05:36.794 --> 05:38.379
Wait, what is happening?
Knew what?

05:38.463 --> 05:40.214
Rose told everyone
at school to call her Rock.

05:40.298 --> 05:45.887
Well, is it Rock as in
like a jokey nickname,

05:45.970 --> 05:49.390
or is it Rock as in,
"I don't wanna be
Rose anymore"?

05:49.474 --> 05:52.810
Sorry, sweetie...
I don't know the context.

05:52.894 --> 05:55.104
(chopping loudly)

05:55.188 --> 05:57.065
Are, are you hammering
or something?

05:57.148 --> 06:00.109
No, no, I'm just making snacks.

06:01.652 --> 06:04.197
-Bam! I'm beating you, Dad.
-Oh no! Dude!

06:04.280 --> 06:05.990
You lose, come on!

06:06.074 --> 06:11.329
-Oh!
-Harry, can we please take
a moment from exploding frogs?

06:11.412 --> 06:14.248
I'm confused.
I need information.

06:14.332 --> 06:18.711
Rose, did you change
your name at school to Rock?

06:18.795 --> 06:20.963
-Yeah.
-You changed your name?

06:21.047 --> 06:22.090
And you didn't
want to tell us

06:22.173 --> 06:24.634
before you told
everyone at school?

06:24.717 --> 06:25.134
I did let you know.

06:25.218 --> 06:26.969
I put up a TikTok.

06:27.053 --> 06:29.472
Well, you put up
about 10 TikToks today,

06:29.555 --> 06:31.766
so... I guess I'm behind.

06:31.849 --> 06:33.101
-(electronic music playing)
-Here.

06:35.645 --> 06:37.522
(raps)
♪ Yo, my name is Rock ♪

06:37.605 --> 06:38.898

06:38.981 --> 06:41.651

06:41.734 --> 06:44.445

06:44.529 --> 06:47.156
♪ R-o-c-k, Rock ♪

06:47.240 --> 06:48.491
R-o-c-k, Rock.
We get it.

06:50.868 --> 06:53.079
I'm sorry, what,
wh-what's happenin'?

06:53.162 --> 06:55.289
Are, are you a rapper now?

06:55.373 --> 06:58.084
-Is, is Rock
your rapper name?
-Dad.

06:58.167 --> 07:00.294
Rapper name?
Don't ever say that again.

07:00.378 --> 07:01.629
Charlotte:
Let's stay focused.

07:01.712 --> 07:06.008
Did you do this
because your friend Ellen
changed her name to Eli?

07:06.092 --> 07:09.011
No, it's because
I feel like Rock.

07:09.095 --> 07:11.764
And Eli now
goes by Scout.

07:11.848 --> 07:15.184
Well, good for Scout,
so let me get this straight.

07:15.268 --> 07:18.146
Everyone at school is
now calling you Rock?

07:18.229 --> 07:19.188
Even your teachers?

07:19.272 --> 07:20.815
Yeah, they're cool with it.

07:20.898 --> 07:22.400
Oh, well, as long
as they're cool with it.

07:26.112 --> 07:27.488
-Hey!
-Oh, hey!

07:27.572 --> 07:30.032
-You still up?
-Yeah, just need
to get some water.

07:31.450 --> 07:33.536
Wow, you get a lotta
packages from Amazon.

07:33.619 --> 07:37.957
Yes, I do... too many...
and not all for me.

07:38.040 --> 07:42.461
Uh, tube socks and Astroglide.
(gasps) Strawberry flavor.

07:44.881 --> 07:47.341
Sorry, meant to intercept that.

07:47.425 --> 07:49.135
Miranda:
Next time, please do.

07:51.512 --> 07:53.890
You know, I love how cool
you are about all that stuff.

07:53.973 --> 07:56.601
I mean, if my mom ever
opened my lube in her house,

07:56.684 --> 07:58.352
she would've choked me
to death with a rosary.

08:03.107 --> 08:04.901
Ooh, what book did you order?

08:04.984 --> 08:09.030
Oh, I, uh, I didn't order this.
Must be a mistake.

08:09.113 --> 08:12.992
Yeah, it's, it's a mistake.
That's not for me.

08:13.075 --> 08:14.577
Luisa:
See, that's why I never
order things online.

08:14.660 --> 08:16.579
You never know who has
access to your information.

08:16.662 --> 08:20.583
Well, I'm, uh, I'm definitely
gonna check my account

08:20.666 --> 08:22.210
because I did not order this.

08:27.089 --> 08:29.217
-Receptionist: Name?
-Oh, Carrie Bradshaw
for Dr. Patel.

08:29.300 --> 08:32.845
I, I filled out
all the forms online

08:32.929 --> 08:35.223
during an extremely
productive panic attack.

08:35.306 --> 08:38.267
Excellent.
Well, then, Miss Bradshaw,
take this buzzer,

08:38.351 --> 08:40.478
and when it lights up,
we'll take you back.

08:40.561 --> 08:43.981
-Really? Am I at Applebee's?
-You wish.

08:44.065 --> 08:44.982
Lucky for you,
our knives are sharper.

08:45.066 --> 08:48.069
-(chuckles) Okay, thank you.
-You're welcome.

08:48.152 --> 08:48.486
Ouch.

08:51.822 --> 08:53.491
Ugh.

08:55.993 --> 08:58.579
This is very unsettling.

08:58.663 --> 09:00.248
Well, it is a hospital.

09:00.331 --> 09:02.750
No, I meant
my stocks and socks.

09:02.833 --> 09:05.419
From here down I look
like a Vermont art teacher.

09:05.503 --> 09:07.505
(laughs)

09:07.588 --> 09:09.090
Will I be able
to trade this in

09:09.173 --> 09:10.508
for a free margarita
at the end?

09:12.009 --> 09:12.927
Oh.

09:13.010 --> 09:15.846
Speaking of that,

09:15.930 --> 09:19.684
Charlotte sent me a book
about quitting drinking.

09:19.767 --> 09:20.977
-She did?
-Yeah.

09:21.060 --> 09:22.728
I was unboxing
my teenage son's

09:22.812 --> 09:24.480
artificially
flavored lubricant

09:24.563 --> 09:25.648
and sweat socks,

09:25.731 --> 09:27.567
and I found a package
with a book in it

09:27.650 --> 09:29.860
called "Quit Like a Woman:

09:29.944 --> 09:31.862
How to Make
the Radical Choice
Not to Drink,"

09:31.946 --> 09:33.489
and many more
bullshit words.

09:33.572 --> 09:35.116
Quit like a woman?
What does that even mean?
What?

09:35.199 --> 09:37.994
Curtsy to a bottle of vodka
as it makes double your salary

09:38.077 --> 09:41.497
-for doing the exact same job?
-Exactly!

09:41.580 --> 09:45.167
And she didn't even
have the balls to tell me
she sent it.

09:45.251 --> 09:46.794
She just Amazoned me.

09:46.877 --> 09:47.837
Amazoned me?
Did you just make that up?

09:47.920 --> 09:50.631
I think so.

09:50.715 --> 09:53.467
Sh-She could've at least
included a little gift card.

09:53.551 --> 09:57.930
"Dear Miranda,
I think you're an alcoholic.
Love, Charlotte."

09:58.014 --> 10:01.142
-And you're sure she sent it?
-Who else?

10:01.225 --> 10:04.687
Did you see the face
she made when I wanted
to order champagne at lunch?

10:04.770 --> 10:09.692
And at Che's concert,
she was like, "Miranda,
that's three cocktails."

10:09.775 --> 10:11.902
It was a comedy concert,
for God's sake!

10:11.986 --> 10:16.657
-So, you don't think you
need to quit like a woman?
-What?!

10:16.741 --> 10:19.952
No!
What I need to do
is send her a book,

10:20.036 --> 10:21.579
"How to Get the Stick Outta
Your Ass Like a Woman."

10:25.041 --> 10:29.503
-(Carrie sighs)
-Okay, well... I need caffeine.

10:29.587 --> 10:32.590
You gonna drink
your coffee like a woman?

10:32.673 --> 10:34.342
Yeah, want one?

10:34.425 --> 10:36.719
No, I'm on strict
no food or water

10:36.802 --> 10:40.431
-by mouth before
your procedure orders.
-All right.

10:42.600 --> 10:45.186
How about a little
post-surgical recovery treat?

10:45.269 --> 10:46.937
(gasps)
Oh, yes, please.

10:47.021 --> 10:49.023
A, a diet peach Snapple
and a PayDay?

10:49.106 --> 10:54.278
-Wow, you are kind of
a handful lately.
-Sorry.

10:54.362 --> 10:57.448
(light music playing)

11:04.580 --> 11:06.582
Charlotte:
So, I'll be taking
her home tomorrow.

11:06.665 --> 11:09.627
Charlotte: Great.
And I have her on Thursday.

11:10.836 --> 11:12.588
You were a tomboy when
you were younger, right?

11:12.671 --> 11:16.759
Um, I think that if Luisa
were here, she would say

11:16.842 --> 11:20.888
we're not supposed to use
that word but, yeah, still am.

11:20.971 --> 11:23.599
-Let me ask you something.
-Hm?

11:23.682 --> 11:26.435
Did you ever wish that
you weren't a girl?

11:26.519 --> 11:28.896
Sure... Every time
I have a mammogram.

11:28.979 --> 11:31.440
Why?

11:31.524 --> 11:34.235
I'm just, just going
through somethin' with Rose.

11:36.570 --> 11:37.988
Oh, hey.

11:39.907 --> 11:41.117
How long was I asleep?

11:41.200 --> 11:42.743
Uh, 10 minutes?

11:42.827 --> 11:43.744
Hmm.

11:45.329 --> 11:47.039
I think I have to pee.

11:47.498 --> 11:50.584
Wait... No.

11:51.085 --> 11:52.837
No, yeah.

11:54.130 --> 11:55.589
Yeah, I definitely
have to pee.

11:55.673 --> 11:58.592
Well, uh, I'll,
I'll call the nurse.

11:58.676 --> 12:00.177
Oh no, I don't
think I can wait.

12:00.261 --> 12:03.848
I am, I am really feeling that
entire bucket of ice chips

12:03.931 --> 12:04.515
I just wolfed down.

12:04.598 --> 12:07.935
-Um.
-Yeah, I can't wait.

12:08.018 --> 12:11.313
Okay, um, well,
is there a, a,
like a bedpan?

12:11.397 --> 12:14.150
How dare you.

12:14.233 --> 12:16.610
-(Charlotte laughing)
-Just, just lift me up.

12:16.694 --> 12:19.196
I've done it with the nurses.
I can do it with you two.

12:21.574 --> 12:24.660
-Does this hurt?
-No, I feel nothing.

12:24.743 --> 12:27.413
You know that whole
pain pill addiction thing?

12:27.496 --> 12:30.416
-Yeah.
-I totally get it.

12:32.001 --> 12:35.129
Oh, dang.
When did you
get so strong?

12:35.212 --> 12:36.380
Well, I read in
"Parenting Magazine"

12:36.464 --> 12:38.424
that you should
be strong enough

12:38.507 --> 12:39.884
to lift your
heaviest child

12:39.967 --> 12:41.635
in case of emergency.

12:41.719 --> 12:44.138
-What?
-I've been doing burpees.

12:44.889 --> 12:45.264
(scoffs)

12:45.347 --> 12:46.974
(phone ringing)

12:47.057 --> 12:49.810
Oh... um...

12:52.271 --> 12:54.398
Hello.

12:54.482 --> 12:58.819
No, um, Carrie is, um,
indisposed at the moment.
This is...

12:59.612 --> 13:01.071
Rambo.

13:01.155 --> 13:04.658
-Why'd she call herself Rambo?
-I have no idea.

13:04.742 --> 13:07.786
-Can we please
just get me down?
-Mm-hm, mm-hm.

13:07.870 --> 13:09.330
-Okay...
-Okay.

13:09.413 --> 13:10.789
Miranda:
Oh, that's so lovely.

13:10.873 --> 13:13.876
-Oh, okay.
-Miranda: She'll be thrilled.

13:13.959 --> 13:15.294
Uh, no, you should
come right up.

13:15.377 --> 13:18.339
Um, uh, we're in 1406.

13:18.422 --> 13:20.758
Ooh, wee! Ahh.

13:20.841 --> 13:25.429
Well, this is a very
special episode of "Friends,"

13:25.513 --> 13:27.681
"The One Where They
Lower Her to the Toilet."

13:27.765 --> 13:30.684
Miranda:
Okay, I'll see you in a minute.

13:30.768 --> 13:34.188
-Oh good, more people.
-Miranda: It was your boss.

13:34.271 --> 13:36.482
-Do I have a boss?
-Che.

13:36.565 --> 13:38.692
She's on her way up
with dinner for you.

13:38.776 --> 13:41.654
-How nice is that?
-No, no more people.

13:41.737 --> 13:45.574
And it's not she, it's they.
They are on their way up.

13:45.658 --> 13:47.076
Right, I knew that.
I, I wasn't thinking.

13:47.159 --> 13:50.871
No, you weren't because
I'm in a hospital gown
on a toilet,

13:50.955 --> 13:55.042
and I don't need company,
so please make that
Che visit not happen.

13:55.125 --> 13:57.586
No, go, so I can go.

13:58.671 --> 14:01.215
-Okay.
-Should I go, too?

14:01.298 --> 14:02.550
No, sadly, you have to stay

14:02.633 --> 14:05.511
-to help me back up.
-Sure.

14:06.303 --> 14:08.389
(urinating)

14:08.472 --> 14:12.226
Hmm... think it
was a false alarm.

14:12.309 --> 14:15.479
Oh no, Carrie... you're peeing.

14:15.563 --> 14:17.022
I am?

14:17.106 --> 14:19.400
Yes! See?

14:21.527 --> 14:22.486
-Am I done?
-No, not yet.

14:22.570 --> 14:25.322
(urinating continues)

14:25.406 --> 14:26.907
-I'll let you know.
-(softly): Okay.

14:26.991 --> 14:30.411
And so, the doctor walks
into my hospital room

14:30.494 --> 14:33.622
and he announces,
"Cheryl has diverticulitis,"

14:33.706 --> 14:34.498
and my dad,
who'd fallen asleep

14:34.582 --> 14:37.084
in the empty bed
next to mine,

14:37.167 --> 14:39.878
bolts... upright,
out of a dead sleep,

14:39.962 --> 14:42.214
and shouts,
like he's talkin'
to a complete idiot,

14:42.298 --> 14:45.009
"Yeah, we already know
Cheryl likes girls."

14:45.092 --> 14:46.218
Your father thought--

14:46.302 --> 14:47.886
My father thought
the gastroenterologist

14:47.970 --> 14:49.263
had diagnosed me as a dyke.

14:49.346 --> 14:50.639
(both laughing)

14:50.723 --> 14:53.392
It was hilarious.

14:53.475 --> 14:55.894
And thank God the doc
thought it was funny because

14:55.978 --> 14:58.439
I was basically
in and out of here seeing him
for like two years straight,

14:58.522 --> 15:01.567
and that could've gotten,
uh, real awkward.

15:01.650 --> 15:04.612
So... are y--
Are you okay now?
I mean--

15:04.695 --> 15:07.114
-Yeah, I figured out
how to manage it, yeah.
-Mm-hm.

15:07.197 --> 15:08.782
And even though it's
about watching what I eat,

15:08.866 --> 15:11.619
it's also about
watching what I feel...

15:11.702 --> 15:12.786
what I say, what I do.

15:15.164 --> 15:15.831
-(Che sighs)
-What do you mean?

15:18.167 --> 15:20.419
Cheryl used to hold
everything in...

15:20.502 --> 15:22.463
all that unhappiness,
and, and shame

15:22.546 --> 15:25.466
just twisted up in there,

15:25.549 --> 15:27.176
just, yeah, making her
physically and emotionally
constipated,

15:27.259 --> 15:31.972
just lying to herself
and everyone else,
just feeling so trapped.

15:32.056 --> 15:38.687
(sighs)
But now, now I just--
I let it all out.

15:38.771 --> 15:41.106
I tell the whole truth
on myself on stage, off.

15:41.190 --> 15:43.984
I feel it.
I, I do it. I be it.

15:44.068 --> 15:45.361
So much healthier.

15:45.444 --> 15:47.446
I mean, I-I'm not saying
I got all of me figured out,

15:47.529 --> 15:49.239
but I haven't
shit my pants
in three years.

15:49.323 --> 15:50.741
I'm sorry,
I know we're eating.

15:50.824 --> 15:52.534
Well, I can't
top that win...

15:52.618 --> 15:53.911
(laughs)

15:53.994 --> 15:56.246
but, um...

15:56.330 --> 15:57.748
I was feeling trapped, too,

15:57.831 --> 16:00.751
-at, at my law firm.
-Mm-hm.

16:01.418 --> 16:02.961
So, I finally just quit.

16:05.631 --> 16:07.257
It felt like...

16:08.884 --> 16:11.053
like life's too short,

16:11.136 --> 16:13.097
-you know?
-Oh yeah.

16:15.599 --> 16:17.267
Good for you.

16:17.768 --> 16:19.770
Good for you.

16:23.774 --> 16:25.734
Oh, that's really spicy.

16:25.818 --> 16:27.528
Do you think I'd
bring anything mild?

16:27.611 --> 16:29.405
-No, oh my god.
-(Che laughs)

16:29.488 --> 16:31.031
-Oh no.
-Oh.

16:31.115 --> 16:32.908
♪ ♪

16:36.954 --> 16:39.456
Okay... you get
the wheelchair, Nick.

16:39.540 --> 16:41.375
-I'll get the precious cargo.
-Nick: Alright.

16:43.627 --> 16:45.379
Okay, be right back, Carrie.

16:45.462 --> 16:47.464
And then, I'll put ya
in your wheelchair,

16:47.548 --> 16:50.342
and take ya upstairs
to eat your din-din.

16:52.511 --> 16:55.389
As much as I die
for his Baby Jane Hudson,

16:55.472 --> 16:57.099
this is all
very unnecessary.

16:57.182 --> 16:59.393
I've could've just
taken an ambulette home.

16:59.476 --> 17:00.936
No, it's important
for him to help.

17:01.019 --> 17:02.187
He needs to know that
he's still included.

17:02.271 --> 17:07.359
It's also important
that I don't tumble
out the chair

17:07.443 --> 17:08.819
and kiss all 10 steps.

17:08.902 --> 17:10.779
I'm gonna talk to him
and make sure it's safe.

17:11.238 --> 17:12.865
Please do.

17:12.948 --> 17:15.284
Anthony, Carrie is worried
you're gonna drop her.

17:15.367 --> 17:17.745
I'm not liftin' her.
I'll pop my hernia net.

17:17.828 --> 17:20.372
That's what
Prince Boner here is for.

17:20.456 --> 17:22.458
-Are you ready?
-Ready for what?

17:22.541 --> 17:23.709
For me.

17:25.169 --> 17:25.919
Oh.

17:27.504 --> 17:31.300
Oh, boop-boop.

17:31.383 --> 17:34.219
-Anthony:
This thing's high as a kite.
-Ah, feel like I'm flying.

17:34.303 --> 17:36.263
-Are you okay, Carrie?
-Never better.

17:36.346 --> 17:40.976
In fact, I take it back.
This was totally necessary.

17:41.852 --> 17:43.061
Okay.

17:43.145 --> 17:44.229
Oh, no, no, no, no, Jack.

17:44.313 --> 17:47.941
You cannot say
boundaries and girlfriends

17:48.025 --> 17:50.110
in the same sentence.

17:50.194 --> 17:52.613
My girlfriends are
always there for me,

17:52.696 --> 17:57.493
no... matter... what.

17:57.576 --> 17:59.620
They are there for me.
In fact, you know what?

17:59.703 --> 18:01.622
I remember this time

18:01.705 --> 18:03.999
that my friend, Samantha Jones,

18:04.082 --> 18:09.129
even pulled my diaphragm
out with her bare hand

18:09.213 --> 18:10.422
because it got stuck.

18:10.506 --> 18:12.800
-(laughing)
-Boundaries, Carrie.

18:12.883 --> 18:16.136
And I'm saying
it was really stuck,

18:16.220 --> 18:18.430
like she was up
in there for like

18:18.514 --> 18:21.099
-a minute.
-Oh, a whole minute! Yes!

18:21.183 --> 18:24.770
-I'm sweating.
-Schvitzing like a pig.
Yas, queen!

18:24.853 --> 18:26.980
Uh, well, this podcast

18:27.064 --> 18:29.983
just became everything
I ever wanted it to be,

18:30.067 --> 18:32.319
so I just wanna thank everyone
for making this episode

18:32.402 --> 18:33.695
of "X, Y, and Me" possible,

18:33.779 --> 18:38.367
especially the doctor
who prescribed whatever
painkillers Carrie's on.

18:38.450 --> 18:40.035
-Peace, everybody.
-Leave meeting.

18:40.118 --> 18:44.957
So, back to bed,
or a little walk around?

18:45.040 --> 18:49.211
-Uhh... bed, please.
-Charlotte: Okay. (laughs)

18:49.294 --> 18:56.218
I feel I am, finally...
getting the hang

18:56.301 --> 18:58.720
of this podcasting thing, huh?

18:58.804 --> 19:00.347
Yeah!

19:00.430 --> 19:02.432
-Ooh!
-Ooh, ah, ah!

19:02.516 --> 19:03.725
-Did ya hear me?
-I did, I did.

19:03.809 --> 19:07.020
You sounded
extremely comfortable.

19:07.104 --> 19:09.314
Did, did you hear
what you said?

19:10.440 --> 19:11.024
Well, what did I say?

19:13.193 --> 19:13.986
You told the diaphragm story,

19:14.069 --> 19:16.071
and you mentioned
Samantha by name.

19:18.365 --> 19:20.367
-I did?
-Uh-huh.

19:20.450 --> 19:23.161
Well... there are a lot
of Samanthas out there.

19:23.245 --> 19:26.039
Well, you used
her last name, too.

19:26.123 --> 19:28.292
-Oops.
-Do you think she'll
be okay with that?

19:28.375 --> 19:29.209
Carrie:
Uh...

19:29.293 --> 19:31.712
I think I'm allowed
to tell the story.

19:31.795 --> 19:36.592
It's... my vagina...
my story.

19:36.675 --> 19:38.886
Besides, this podcast
isn't even on her radar.

19:38.969 --> 19:41.930
She's off in... London.

19:42.014 --> 19:45.851
Yeah, but...
I read the "Daily Mail."

19:45.934 --> 19:49.855
Oh, what--
What, you think
she would be upset?

19:49.938 --> 19:53.734
I just think, maybe,
you should let her know.
That's all.

19:53.817 --> 19:56.111
And, that way,
if someone else tells her,

19:56.194 --> 19:57.905
she's not gonna be surprised.

20:02.993 --> 20:05.078
I think what Robin is
trying to say is that

20:05.162 --> 20:07.998
a child at this age
is still developing,

20:08.081 --> 20:10.584
and exploring
who they are.

20:10.667 --> 20:12.920
-Do I have that right, Robin?
-Yes.

20:13.003 --> 20:16.006
-More or less.
-And we, we get all that.

20:16.965 --> 20:19.092
We're just--
We're a little taken aback

20:19.176 --> 20:20.761
that this particular child

20:20.844 --> 20:24.431
was allowed
to adopt a new name

20:24.514 --> 20:26.516
without the parents
being informed.

20:26.600 --> 20:29.728
I honestly had no idea
that you didn't know.

20:29.811 --> 20:31.605
-Did you, Robin?
-I did not, Laura.

20:31.688 --> 20:33.273
Rock never gave
us any clue that

20:33.357 --> 20:34.858
their parents were resistant
to their changing identity.

20:34.942 --> 20:38.779
Their?
D-Did you just say their?

20:38.862 --> 20:41.698
We are not resistant, Robin.

20:41.782 --> 20:45.035
And according to my reading,
Laura, there is a wide range

20:45.118 --> 20:46.578
in this type of exploration,

20:46.662 --> 20:48.080
so we are just
trying to figure out

20:48.163 --> 20:50.249
how seriously we
should take this.

20:50.332 --> 20:53.126
This is a very supportive
environment for all children.

20:53.210 --> 20:58.966
Cisgender, gender fluid,
nonbinary, trans.

20:59.049 --> 21:02.177
Exactly.
This is a journey that
we are all on together.

21:02.260 --> 21:03.136
We're here for you,
and we can recommend

21:03.220 --> 21:06.598
a therapist,
support group,
peer counseling,

21:06.682 --> 21:11.311
-whatever would help.
-Wait. Therapy? Counseling?

21:11.395 --> 21:13.438
What happened to the part
about a child this age

21:13.522 --> 21:14.815
is still growing
and exploring?

21:14.898 --> 21:17.275
That's still true...

21:17.359 --> 21:19.778
but Rock is very clear,

21:19.861 --> 21:23.657
and in matters such as this,
we take our cues
from the children.

21:23.740 --> 21:26.159
We're talkin' about
a 12-year-old here.

21:26.243 --> 21:28.620
Rose would eat
ice cream for every meal
if it was up to her.

21:29.246 --> 21:30.330
Rock.

21:35.335 --> 21:37.587
So, we just have
to accept this now?

21:37.671 --> 21:39.256
This is done.
They made the call.

21:40.257 --> 21:41.842
I don't even
know if I buy it.

21:41.925 --> 21:43.552
Rose is a showoff,
a big ham.

21:43.635 --> 21:46.972
Could just be
for attention...
or to bug us.

21:47.055 --> 21:48.932
She practically
gave us the finger
at her 3D ultrasound.

21:49.016 --> 21:53.020
(student choir singing)

21:53.103 --> 21:57.566
Hearing people who aren't you
talk about your kid to you...

21:57.649 --> 22:01.403
it's the most humbling
experience I've ever had
as a father.

22:03.238 --> 22:05.240
You're a wonderful father.

22:51.828 --> 22:54.414
I was just stopping by
with two things to help Carrie
podcast better from home:

22:54.498 --> 22:57.125
a professional mic
and some aged tequila,

22:57.209 --> 22:59.127
also known as
Keep Carrie Talking.

22:59.211 --> 23:01.922
Oh, come on in.

23:02.005 --> 23:04.549
-Ooh.
-She's, um, taking
a little opioid nap now.

23:04.633 --> 23:07.719
-We gotta keep it down.
-Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I got it.

23:07.803 --> 23:09.387
Got it, so probably
not a great idea to ask

23:09.471 --> 23:11.765
-if she wants
to do a shot then.
-Probably not.

23:13.850 --> 23:14.392
But you could ask me.

34:35.364 --> 34:38.326
and follow her--
their lead.

34:39.327 --> 34:39.952
(sighs)

34:40.036 --> 34:43.039
But every time
I open my mouth,

34:43.122 --> 34:45.500
I just want to say Rose,
not Rock.

34:45.583 --> 34:47.877
(exhales)

34:50.713 --> 34:52.799
I don't know
what's gonna happen.

34:52.882 --> 34:55.051
But I know that kid
is amazing.

34:59.931 --> 35:05.394
And just remember,
a rose by any other name
would smell as sweet.

35:09.565 --> 35:10.691
Carrie.

35:11.901 --> 35:15.655
I'm Travis,
the physical therapist.

35:15.738 --> 35:16.906
Shall we go back?

35:17.406 --> 35:19.367
Yeah.

35:21.160 --> 35:22.161
Shall I help you up?

35:23.412 --> 35:24.580
Yeah.

35:26.999 --> 35:28.251
(grunts)

35:29.627 --> 35:30.962
So, I have the philosophy
that PT works best

35:31.045 --> 35:34.590
when we're working
towards a goal.

35:34.674 --> 35:36.884
Do you have
a long-term
physical goal?

35:36.968 --> 35:39.053
-To get back into heels.
-(laughs)

35:40.805 --> 35:42.014
Oh, uh, any others?

35:42.098 --> 35:46.269
Just the one.
To get back into heels.

35:47.645 --> 35:50.022
Okay, uh, so you change,
and then, I'll be back in

35:50.106 --> 35:53.526
and we'll start with a deep
lower body massage.

35:53.609 --> 35:55.319
-Does that sound good?
-Yeah.

35:56.112 --> 35:56.153
Great.

35:59.115 --> 36:03.077
Yes, I'd like to book
my next session with Travis.

36:03.161 --> 36:06.539
Actually, your insurance
doesn't cover Travis.

36:06.622 --> 36:09.542
The system didn't
catch it before
but we've rectified it,

36:09.625 --> 36:12.295
so all of your future
appointments will be with

36:13.212 --> 36:14.505
Emmett here.

36:17.008 --> 36:19.468
Hi, I'm ready for you,
Miss Johnson.

36:19.552 --> 36:22.513
I'm willing to pay
out of pocket.

36:22.597 --> 36:24.849
Okay... Travis then.

36:24.932 --> 36:26.058
Okay, yeah.
