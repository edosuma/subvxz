15:02.763 --> 15:06.077
You know, one that I thought
would be
resilient enough

15:06.215 --> 15:10.633
to stand up there next
to Madonna and Jackson
and Prince.

15:11.841 --> 15:13.395
Ladies and gentlemen,

15:14.844 --> 15:16.191
George Michael.

15:17.813 --> 15:19.815
MICHAEL: And I guess I did that
pretty effectively,

15:19.953 --> 15:23.957
alongside what was
a very, very commercial record.

15:36.866 --> 15:39.214
♪ Well, I guess
It would be nice

15:39.352 --> 15:41.975
♪ If I could touch your body

15:42.113 --> 15:47.222
♪ I know not everybody
Has got a body like you♪

15:47.360 --> 15:52.641
The attitude, he was creating,
like, a personage
as we call it, you know.

15:52.779 --> 15:54.022
He was very charismatic.

15:54.160 --> 15:57.025
Every video
was a very strong impact.

15:57.163 --> 16:01.719
♪ Oh, but I need some time off
From that...♪

16:01.857 --> 16:06.310
GAULTIER: He is, like,
coming in jeans, you know,
and like tight and sexy.

16:06.448 --> 16:10.728
And like a rock image and moving
with the hips like that.

16:10.866 --> 16:13.524
You know, a little
like Wham! before, you know.

16:13.662 --> 16:16.976
A little like that,
but more, like, sexy.

16:17.114 --> 16:19.564
Check this out then,
modern day Elvis.

16:19.702 --> 16:22.878
♪ Faith, I gotta have...♪

16:23.016 --> 16:27.365
I liked the spirit of "Faith",
because you do have to have it.

16:27.503 --> 16:29.678
I remember his "Baby, ow!"

16:29.816 --> 16:30.955
♪ Baby♪

16:31.093 --> 16:32.888
Yeah, I remember that.

16:33.026 --> 16:35.649
MICHAEL: I didn't realize
that people would look
at the "Faith" image

16:35.787 --> 16:37.099
and go, "Fuck, that's cool."

16:37.237 --> 16:39.377
♪ I'm givin' you the blues♪

16:39.515 --> 16:42.898
I was really, really
overwhelmed by the size
of things, I suppose.

16:43.036 --> 16:44.969
I lived in fucking sunglasses.

16:45.107 --> 16:47.420
I couldn't make eye contact
with people. It was bizarre.

16:47.558 --> 16:50.871
♪ And another who tied me
Down to loverboy rules♪

16:51.010 --> 16:55.186
I still suffered terribly
with insecurity about my looks.

16:55.324 --> 16:58.017
It goes back
to a family background

16:58.155 --> 17:03.677
where conceit of any kind
was considered an absolute sin.

17:03.815 --> 17:06.266
So, no one
was ever praised about
the way they looked.

17:06.404 --> 17:08.303
♪ Well, I need someone
To hold me

17:08.441 --> 17:10.857
♪ But I'll wait
For somethin' more

17:10.994 --> 17:12.617
♪ Yes, I gotta have faith♪

17:12.755 --> 17:18.382
"Faith" was number one
in Britain for one week.

17:18.520 --> 17:21.522
But in America,
number one for 12 weeks.

17:21.661 --> 17:25.078
And then on top of that,
he had four number one singles,

17:25.215 --> 17:28.702
a number two single
and a number five single.

17:28.840 --> 17:33.224
In 1988, he was the biggest
pop star in the world.

17:33.362 --> 17:35.778
♪ Because I gotta have faith
Faith, faith

17:35.916 --> 17:39.368
♪ I gotta have faith,
Faith, faith♪

17:39.506 --> 17:45.443
All I remember is "Faith"
being played 50 times a day
on MTV.

17:45.581 --> 17:49.723
You had to be in heavy
rotation on whatever
pop station you were on.

17:49.861 --> 17:55.384
Duran Duran, David Bowie,
Eurythmics was played
on MTV, like, constantly,

17:55.522 --> 17:57.248
played on all
the video stations.

17:57.386 --> 17:59.595
You really didn't hear
any of those artists,

17:59.733 --> 18:04.773
but you heard George Michael,
on some of the urban stations,
right after Luther Vandross.

18:04.911 --> 18:07.362
His music broke through
to everybody.

18:08.777 --> 18:12.091
MICHAEL: In America,
radio play for me

18:12.229 --> 18:15.197
was substantial
on a lot of R&B stations.

18:15.335 --> 18:19.615
He uniquely achieved recognition
on the R&B soul charts

18:19.753 --> 18:22.308
that very few white performers
ever got.

18:24.586 --> 18:28.003
He obviously had studied
American soul music,

18:28.141 --> 18:30.971
and felt a connection
and a kindred spirit.

18:33.940 --> 18:36.425
We were introduced
to each other,

18:36.563 --> 18:41.465
so, we're going back now
to about '86 maybe.

18:41.603 --> 18:45.676
And it was his thought
that he wanted to

18:45.814 --> 18:49.473
do a duet
with one of my artists.

18:49.611 --> 18:51.164
♪ Like a warrior that fights

18:51.992 --> 18:53.925
♪ And wins the battle♪

18:54.063 --> 18:55.755
MICHAEL:
When I was about six or seven,

18:55.893 --> 18:59.586
I had a wind-up gramophone
that my mum gave me.

18:59.724 --> 19:02.037
I had two Supreme singles,

19:02.175 --> 19:06.214
one wasStop! In the Name
of Love and one
wasBaby Love.

19:06.352 --> 19:09.803
And I hadDelilah by Tom Jones,
which is funny,

19:09.941 --> 19:11.943
because I kind of ended up
somewhere between

19:12.081 --> 19:14.083
the Supremes and Tom Jones
when you think about it.

19:14.222 --> 19:16.569
♪ I know you did

19:37.521 --> 19:39.626
MICHAEL:
It was great that I had my
own voice

19:39.764 --> 19:41.732
and I had worked
with Aretha Franklin,

19:41.870 --> 19:43.423
and everything
had gone so well.

19:43.561 --> 19:47.047
From an artistic point of view,
it just got better and better.

19:48.325 --> 19:51.190
George Michael's voice, to me,
was always very soulful,

19:51.328 --> 19:56.850
and it was very warm,
and sultry and urgent.

19:56.988 --> 19:58.852
He has soul. Period.

19:58.990 --> 20:02.718
Soul is an expression
of the soul, of the heart.

20:04.237 --> 20:06.757
MICHAEL:
It was good to be number one
in the black charts.

20:06.895 --> 20:10.381
It was an amazing
thing to see, obviously.

20:10.519 --> 20:12.349
England has a great love
affair with

20:12.487 --> 20:16.801
American black music and R&B
and a great tradition of

20:16.939 --> 20:20.219
our own interpretation
of soul music and that thing,
but he's...

20:21.496 --> 20:23.360
He's kind of up there,
at the pinnacle of it.

20:23.498 --> 20:26.604

20:46.210 --> 20:51.042

20:53.631 --> 20:57.359
MICHAEL: Making that album,
I'm sure I was incredibly
proud of it,

20:57.497 --> 21:00.638
but I don't think I ever
imagined it would be
bigger than Wham!.

21:00.776 --> 21:03.192
RODGERS:
I imagine that the pressure
on someone like George

21:03.331 --> 21:05.056
must have been insane,

21:05.194 --> 21:09.785
because he was doing stuff
that was just
so phenomenal.

21:09.923 --> 21:12.340
After you have
that kind of success,

21:12.478 --> 21:16.861
like, what do you
go home at night and go,
"Now, what do I do?"

21:19.381 --> 21:22.626
MICHAEL:
I do remember it being
shocking to me

21:22.764 --> 21:26.940
that I could become more
successful than I had
been with Wham!

21:27.078 --> 21:31.566
I suppose the whole
exercise was an effort to
raise my profile

21:31.704 --> 21:34.672
to kind of define what
my solo image
was going to be.

21:34.810 --> 21:37.365
But I really had no idea
how effective
it was going to be,

21:37.503 --> 21:38.849
especially in America.

21:40.437 --> 21:46.235
And I had no idea what
it was like to be that big
in America.

21:46.374 --> 21:48.721
WOMAN: George is really,
really private

21:48.859 --> 21:51.275
and I think, when he was young,
with all that fame,

21:51.413 --> 21:56.176
I just think it came too fast,
and it wasn't actually
what he was expecting.

21:56.315 --> 21:59.145
I was probably
most out of control,

21:59.283 --> 22:02.735
in any kind of sense of that,
during the whole "Faith" thing.

22:05.565 --> 22:10.190
Being caught in the eye
of this storm
is catastrophic.

22:10.329 --> 22:15.782
It's just 24/7 full time
in your face.

22:15.920 --> 22:19.165
I mean, the wind burn
is terrible.

22:19.303 --> 22:24.273
MICHAEL: I can't really explain
how overwhelming

22:24.412 --> 22:29.175
that kind of hysteria can be
if there's only one person
to absorb it.

22:29.313 --> 22:33.731
When I was with Andrew,
it was so easy to keep
one foot in my old life,

22:33.869 --> 22:37.597
the life that I had known
with him before
we'd been famous.

22:37.735 --> 22:39.668
It was so easy
to keep each other grounded,

22:39.806 --> 22:41.360
to take the piss out
of each other,

22:41.498 --> 22:42.982
and be able to look
at each other

22:43.120 --> 22:46.779
and talk about the madness
that was going on around us.

22:46.917 --> 22:49.713
But when you can't do that,
suddenly, it is scary.

22:51.956 --> 22:58.998
I don't know many 24-year-olds
who would not have,
at least subconsciously,

22:59.136 --> 23:02.035
found that frightening enough
to self-destruct.

23:04.452 --> 23:06.039
PAUL RUSSELL:
Now the problem is,
the record came out

23:06.177 --> 23:08.697
everywhere in the world,
pretty much at the same time.

23:08.835 --> 23:14.393
So, everybody wanted
a piece of George
to help promote the album.

23:16.222 --> 23:17.568
Enormous pressure.

23:17.706 --> 23:19.225
Huge, huge pressure.

23:20.882 --> 23:24.748
MICHAEL:
Ten months of that was enough
to really push me to the edge.

23:26.059 --> 23:29.408
And I was terribly lonely,
you know?

23:29.546 --> 23:33.308
Me and my red line
were very lonely.

23:33.446 --> 23:38.486
And the only good part
of my day was playing live.

23:38.624 --> 23:41.350
When I sang
"Careless Whisper"...

23:41.489 --> 23:44.699
I can't remember which
was the last gig
on the American tour,

23:44.837 --> 23:46.390
which would have been
the end of the whole tour.

23:46.528 --> 23:48.668
I think it was Pensacola.

23:48.806 --> 23:51.533
But when I sang
"Careless Whisper" that night,

23:51.671 --> 23:55.295
I remember standing there,
with a tear
in my eye, thinking,

23:55.434 --> 23:58.022
"I really don't know
if I'll ever do this again."

23:59.127 --> 24:02.613
♪ Time can never mend

24:11.208 --> 24:15.108
♪ The careless whispers

24:16.247 --> 24:20.424

In the truth

24:43.896 --> 24:51.075
♪ Pain is all♪

25:15.134 --> 25:21.485
I was intelligent enough
to know I should not be trying
to catch up with

25:21.623 --> 25:24.108
Michael Jackson or Madonna
or whatever,

25:24.246 --> 25:27.353
which was absolutely what
I was intent on doing.

25:27.491 --> 25:34.705
I felt that tired and exhausted
at being the center
of that much attention.

25:34.843 --> 25:38.260
I suppose the way my lack
of mental balance showed itself

25:38.398 --> 25:42.713
was that I actually
really began
to hide away when I got home.

25:44.025 --> 25:46.545
And I did almost nothing
for a year,

25:46.683 --> 25:51.342
but try and reestablish
some idea of the real life.

25:53.413 --> 25:57.763
Music was
my very controlling lover.

25:59.074 --> 26:02.388
I had millions of lovers
that I never saw

26:02.526 --> 26:06.219
other than
in the sense of live work.

26:06.944 --> 26:08.567
But I still deserved one.

26:08.705 --> 26:10.292
Just one of them for me.

26:12.053 --> 26:16.644
And I knew that
the only way I was gonna find
that one person,

26:16.782 --> 26:21.441
that lover,
was to jump off
of the merry-go-round

26:21.580 --> 26:25.135
just for long enough
to catch my breath,

26:25.273 --> 26:30.278
and letting my heart rule
my head, rather than,
you know, the red line.

26:31.624 --> 26:34.834
The red line that goes
up, up, up, up, up, up.

26:36.422 --> 26:39.080
Sometimes you feel like he's...

26:39.218 --> 26:42.670
He's got, like, a layer or two
of skin missing.

26:45.017 --> 26:49.538
Like he just,
like he bruises easier,

26:49.677 --> 26:52.541
and because of that,
he can write
these amazing songs.

26:52.680 --> 26:55.234
I never wanted
to be someone else.

26:55.372 --> 27:00.135
I wanted to be a star,
and I wanted people to love me
and recognize me in the street.

27:00.273 --> 27:01.654
As a child,
that's what I wanted,

27:01.792 --> 27:04.105
but I never really wanted
to be someone else.

27:06.003 --> 27:08.488
I believe I am a writer
much more than I am
anything else.

27:08.627 --> 27:10.698
And I want to leave songs.

27:10.836 --> 27:14.322
I believe I can leave songs
that will be, will mean
something to other generations.

27:18.844 --> 27:21.743
This award is for
favorite soul and R&B album.

27:21.881 --> 27:27.507
And the winner is,
George Michael.

27:28.060 --> 27:29.406
George Michael.

27:40.003 --> 27:42.868
I've been a lover of soul music
since I was a kid.

27:45.525 --> 27:49.357
And I'd just like to thank
everybody who has helped me
this year.

27:49.495 --> 27:53.361
I'd like to thank Black Radio,
I'd like to thank everyone
at CBS Records,

27:54.086 --> 27:55.397
in the R&B department.

27:55.535 --> 27:58.055
And I'd like to thank everyone
who voted for me.

27:58.193 --> 27:59.816
I can't believe it.
Thank you very much.

28:02.888 --> 28:07.444
I won these two awards
that were traditionally
received by black artists.

28:09.964 --> 28:13.174
And I think there
was a perception
that it had gone too far.

28:13.312 --> 28:17.592
The black male artist
works very hard to get his due,

28:17.730 --> 28:20.802
and Bobby Brown
had across the board play.

28:20.940 --> 28:25.773
And he could compete
in the same category
as George Michael competes in.

28:25.911 --> 28:27.429
That would be
a whole another thing.

28:27.567 --> 28:29.535
I didn't ask to be given
those awards,

28:29.673 --> 28:32.987
I'm not going to pretend
I wasn't happy to get them.

28:33.125 --> 28:36.784
But I do understand
what the argument that says,

28:36.922 --> 28:41.685
"This guy is just
an acceptable version
of black music

28:41.823 --> 28:44.239
for White America."

28:44.377 --> 28:47.415
Suddenly, crossover
was not hip.

28:47.553 --> 28:51.005
And I see that point.
I totally saw the point
at the time.

28:51.143 --> 28:52.834
I just felt it was sad,
you know,

28:52.972 --> 28:55.388
that white and black people
recording together,

28:55.526 --> 28:58.115
suddenly was, kind of,
dancing with the enemy.

28:58.840 --> 28:59.841
You mean George is white?

29:01.532 --> 29:02.533
Are you serious?

29:03.017 --> 29:04.018

it outsold Faith,

57:02.453 --> 57:04.490
because I think it
was actually a better album.

57:04.628 --> 57:05.905
But it wasn't about that.

57:06.043 --> 57:10.185
It was about the total and utter
lack of respect

57:10.323 --> 57:13.775
that the minute somebody doesn't
see themselves as a commodity,

57:13.913 --> 57:16.398
that they have the audacity
to think,

57:16.536 --> 57:19.677
"My God, I am actually
creating something

57:19.815 --> 57:23.440
and I must keep myself sane
in order to do that."

57:23.578 --> 57:26.788
The minute somebody does that,
they're over.

57:26.926 --> 57:30.136
We tried very, very hard

57:30.274 --> 57:34.485
to get the American executives
to come over

57:34.623 --> 57:38.765
and listen to why George felt
the way that he did

57:38.903 --> 57:41.665
from George, 'cause there
was no-one better
to put that forward

57:41.803 --> 57:45.462
than George Michael
telling them,
as he had told us.

57:47.049 --> 57:50.397
The reasons how he really
felt deep down.

57:51.606 --> 57:53.021
But they wouldn't come.

57:53.159 --> 57:57.888
MICHAEL:
There were executives that came
to London in 1989

57:58.026 --> 58:00.166
and we played them the record.

58:00.304 --> 58:05.620
I explained to them that
Faith had taken me
to the edge of madness,

58:05.758 --> 58:10.176
that I wanted to be
a long-term player
in this business.

58:10.314 --> 58:13.973
Now, any logical CEO, I think,
would have thought,

58:14.111 --> 58:16.078
"Okay, he's gonna do this.

58:16.216 --> 58:20.497
He'll get it out of his system
and he'll get back on board."

58:21.187 --> 58:22.740
George is very stubborn.

58:22.878 --> 58:26.054
He's incredibly one of the most
stubborn people I've ever met.

58:26.192 --> 58:28.228
But he was right to be stubborn
on this occasion,

58:28.366 --> 58:30.714
and I'm sure the record company
recoiled in horror.

58:30.852 --> 58:33.855
MICHAEL:
It was very much a clash
of cultures, really.

58:33.993 --> 58:36.858
In America,
there was definitely
a door that shut.

There was the track

58:55.290 --> 58:57.913

It was very difficult

It all fell apart,
not for any
of George's reasons.

59:22.179 --> 59:26.390
It just fell apart,

was not going to reinstate
any kind of
relationship with Sony,

59:50.414 --> 59:51.484
then nothing was.

59:54.176 --> 59:55.868
I don't want to pick a fight.

59:56.006 --> 59:59.078
I just wanted to work
with people who wanted
to work with me

59:59.216 --> 1:00:04.911
and who would have
some respect for the fact
that I was growing up.

1:00:05.049 --> 1:00:09.088
It was deeply,
deeply troubling times,

1:00:09.226 --> 1:00:13.851
because you could see this,
it's like trying to watch
a train wreck in slow motion.

1:00:13.989 --> 1:00:15.957
There is nothing you could
do to stop it.

1:00:24.828 --> 1:00:28.107
MICHAEL:
Anselmo and I were in LA when

1:00:29.522 --> 1:00:31.420
he was advised
to go for his test.

1:00:34.838 --> 1:00:36.667
He hadn't been tested
for a while

1:00:36.805 --> 1:00:38.945
and he was absolutely
healthy looking,

1:00:39.083 --> 1:00:41.603
more than healthy looking,
when I first met him.

1:00:41.741 --> 1:00:44.882
Within a month or two
of meeting him,

1:00:45.020 --> 1:00:48.714
he had a flu
that he couldn't get rid of,

1:00:48.852 --> 1:00:53.580
and some red marks
that came up on his chest.

1:00:53.719 --> 1:00:56.825
And I remember the kind
of terror of...

1:00:58.413 --> 1:01:00.864
me understanding
that this was possibly

1:01:02.175 --> 1:01:05.178
the beginning of, you know,
an illness.

1:01:05.316 --> 1:01:08.354
I remember him
leaving the house and...

1:01:11.012 --> 1:01:16.431
To this day, I remember
looking at the sky and saying,

1:01:16.569 --> 1:01:20.297
"Don't you dare do this to me."

1:01:20.435 --> 1:01:24.922
I mean, I was 20...
27 going on 28.

1:01:25.060 --> 1:01:26.752
But at that point in time,
you think,

1:01:26.890 --> 1:01:29.409
like, that's a lifetime
to have waited to be loved.

1:01:32.378 --> 1:01:34.104
Anselmo had the test

1:01:35.864 --> 1:01:36.969
in Brazil.

1:01:38.556 --> 1:01:45.702
I went home
to my family for Christmas
and sat at the Christmas table

1:01:47.807 --> 1:01:51.155
not knowing whether my partner,
whom the people

1:01:51.293 --> 1:01:53.364
sitting around the table
did not know about,

1:01:53.502 --> 1:01:58.024
not knowing whether
this man I was in love with
was terminally ill.

1:01:58.162 --> 1:02:02.719
And, therefore, not knowing
whether I potentially
was terminally ill.

1:02:02.857 --> 1:02:05.618
That Christmas was probably
the darkest,

1:02:06.895 --> 1:02:11.106
darkest, most frightening
time in my life.

1:02:14.903 --> 1:02:19.666
I remember my publicist
calling me to tell me
that Freddie Mercury had died.

1:02:21.668 --> 1:02:23.532
And he died of HIV obviously.

1:02:25.155 --> 1:02:30.022
And I remember I was...
I was crying and

1:02:30.160 --> 1:02:34.267
I actually just thought...
I mean, bless him,
I was really sad

1:02:35.130 --> 1:02:37.063
that Freddie had passed away.

1:02:37.201 --> 1:02:41.447
But, of course, I was crying
about something else entirely,

1:02:41.585 --> 1:02:46.728
which was the fact that both
my partner and possibly myself
were HIV.

1:02:50.490 --> 1:02:54.253
GERVAIS:
It was an incredibly difficult
period for George,

1:02:54.391 --> 1:02:58.913
because it was something that
he had to hold close
to his chest.

1:03:00.017 --> 1:03:01.916
MICHAEL: I was just
absolutely devastated

1:03:03.020 --> 1:03:05.782
to find out that he had
a terminal illness.

1:03:06.644 --> 1:03:08.129
I was just devastated.

1:03:12.098 --> 1:03:15.584
Even by the time
Freddie's tribute
had been put together,

1:03:15.722 --> 1:03:18.001
I was still sworn to secrecy.

1:03:20.866 --> 1:03:22.695
I just wanted perfection.

1:03:24.662 --> 1:03:26.457
Which is what I always wanted.

1:03:29.564 --> 1:03:33.948
So, I went for five days
to rehearse.

1:03:34.086 --> 1:03:36.502
Everyone else went
for an afternoon.

1:03:36.640 --> 1:03:39.954
I went for five days.

1:03:40.092 --> 1:03:42.611
Because it had to be perfect.

1:03:42.749 --> 1:03:43.785
[SINGING]

1:03:53.795 --> 1:04:00.457
Because I had to take
all those years
of standing in a bedroom,

1:04:00.595 --> 1:04:02.390
with I don't think
I had a hairbrush,

1:04:02.528 --> 1:04:05.462
but I would stand
and sing to the mirror.

1:04:06.946 --> 1:04:10.812
And that child
was going to take
all that knowledge

1:04:10.950 --> 1:04:16.645
all that subconscious
easing in
of music from that group

1:04:16.783 --> 1:04:20.477
and sing one
of Freddie Mercury's songs
to the world

1:04:20.615 --> 1:04:24.481
after his passing
in front of my lover.

1:04:31.729 --> 1:04:36.010
In my subconscious view,
this was, very probably

1:04:36.148 --> 1:04:39.185

I had to honor Freddie Mercury

spine-tingling moment for me

where I handed over the mike
to the audience, and they,

1:07:13.546 --> 1:07:17.688
not only sang the note,
but they did the kind of
descending scale

1:08:42.014 --> 1:08:45.362
It's not an accident
that the performance

1:08:45.500 --> 1:08:51.471
probably most well-known
in my career was sung

1:08:53.783 --> 1:08:57.236
to my lover who was dying,

1:09:01.137 --> 1:09:05.657
who was the reason I had
the strength to go
to battle with Sony.

1:09:08.282 --> 1:09:14.149
I saw it as,
if I'm going to do
nothing but love this man

1:09:14.288 --> 1:09:20.085
and care for this man,
if I could do nothing
beneficial as a musician

1:09:20.225 --> 1:09:23.399
because I cannot even think
of a note,

1:09:23.538 --> 1:09:27.473
maybe I have a chance to do
something truly special

1:09:27.611 --> 1:09:31.995
and change the standard
record contract forever.

1:09:32.133 --> 1:09:39.002
I didn't think that it would end
up in court, at the time

1:09:39.139 --> 1:09:42.419
because I really thought
that sanity will prevail.

1:09:42.557 --> 1:09:43.800
Well, I was wrong.

1:09:44.249 --> 1:09:45.491
It didn't.

1:09:45.629 --> 1:09:48.631
Our relationship broke down
because they said,

1:09:48.770 --> 1:09:51.877
"No, you are this kind
of artist.

1:09:52.014 --> 1:09:55.087
This is the kind of artist
that we sell.

1:09:55.225 --> 1:09:57.469
This is the kind of artist
we know how to sell.

1:09:57.607 --> 1:10:00.057
And if you don't want to sell
yourself that way,

1:10:00.196 --> 1:10:01.852
and you want to go off
on this journey

1:10:01.990 --> 1:10:05.925
and find this other audience,
we're not gonna support you."

1:10:06.063 --> 1:10:09.722
The relationship
had completely disintegrated.

1:10:09.860 --> 1:10:12.656
George flew out to New York
with his publisher

1:10:12.794 --> 1:10:15.245
and basically,
it was at that meeting

1:10:15.383 --> 1:10:17.764
that George told
the head people at Sony

1:10:17.903 --> 1:10:21.527
that he'd wanted out
of the deal,
wanted a divorce.

1:10:21.665 --> 1:10:26.601
What he was basically saying is,
"How can I stay
with a company...

1:10:28.224 --> 1:10:32.952
who won't support me in any
way when I feel so strongly?"

1:10:37.405 --> 1:10:39.442
We issued a writ
three days later.

1:10:43.618 --> 1:10:49.866
MICHAEL: I will never know
if Sony and I
would have ended up in court

1:10:50.004 --> 1:10:52.903
had Anselmo not become ill.

1:10:55.803 --> 1:10:58.702
I was absolutely terrified
of losing him

1:10:58.840 --> 1:11:01.947
and the prospect of watching
him die of AIDS.

1:11:07.642 --> 1:11:10.058
I was in LA
and the phone rang,

1:11:10.196 --> 1:11:14.407
and I was told that Anselmo's
best friend in Brazil
was on the phone.

1:11:15.166 --> 1:11:16.202
And...

1:11:18.032 --> 1:11:20.344
...then it all goes blurry
for a long time.

1:11:51.168 --> 1:11:54.482
He still, 23 years later,
brings a tear to my eye.

1:11:54.620 --> 1:11:57.243
He was... He was my savior.

1:11:57.382 --> 1:12:03.457
It's still very hard
for me to explain how
finding a companion

1:12:03.594 --> 1:12:07.978
at that stage in my life
changed me.

1:12:08.116 --> 1:12:13.570
And such
a beautiful companion,
such an amazing person.

1:12:15.400 --> 1:12:18.644
I think, to some degree,
the Sony court case

1:12:18.782 --> 1:12:21.094
was a perfectly good place
to put my anger.

1:12:21.233 --> 1:12:25.513
I used to go and run
on the treadmill everyday
and play squash

1:12:25.651 --> 1:12:28.550
and do everything I could
to get rid of all of this
anger and fear.

1:12:28.689 --> 1:12:32.106
But the best place for it
was court number one, really.

1:12:33.969 --> 1:12:35.316
PRESSPERSON:
George, come on, George.

1:12:37.594 --> 1:12:40.839
MICHAEL: There was the part
of my personality
that could say,

1:12:40.977 --> 1:12:42.565
"Okay, fuck this!

1:12:42.702 --> 1:12:44.981
This can't all be bad.

1:12:45.119 --> 1:12:48.674
I've got to do something good
with this time in my life

1:12:49.779 --> 1:12:54.646
and change the path
of artists' lives."

1:12:54.784 --> 1:12:58.063
One of Britain's most successful
pop singers, George Michael,

1:12:58.201 --> 1:13:00.341
is today asking a High Court
judge to declare

1:13:00.478 --> 1:13:03.171
his recording contract null
and void.

1:13:03.309 --> 1:13:06.382
He says the contract
with Sony Music
is too restrictive

1:13:06.520 --> 1:13:08.901
and that the company takes
too much of the profits.

1:13:09.039 --> 1:13:11.904
MICHAEL: The deal that I
was working from

1:13:12.041 --> 1:13:13.975
was based
upon the original deal

1:13:14.112 --> 1:13:17.358
which I had signed
with Andrew,
under duress.

1:13:17.496 --> 1:13:23.985
And it recorded a demo
of "Careless Whisper",
"Club Tropicana", "Wham Rap".

1:13:24.123 --> 1:13:27.161
The head of the record company
of Innervison

1:13:27.299 --> 1:13:31.889
turns up with these contracts
and we went to this
greasy spoon cafe.

1:13:32.028 --> 1:13:35.100
And he said "Look,
if you don't sign this now,
the deal is going away.

1:13:35.237 --> 1:13:38.034
"You won't have finished demos
to take away,
you won't own them."

1:13:41.037 --> 1:13:44.143
And we were on our own,
we had nobody with us,
and we signed them.

1:13:46.180 --> 1:13:48.803
When you start a career
with a ridiculous contract

1:13:48.941 --> 1:13:53.187
where someone is paying you
nothing on 12" records,

1:13:53.325 --> 1:13:56.052
one and a half per cent
on the records
that you do sell,

1:13:57.329 --> 1:13:58.813
when you start
from that point,

1:13:58.951 --> 1:14:03.922
you know from that day on
not to trust the industry.

1:14:04.059 --> 1:14:10.135
This was a worldwide,
major artist saying
to a record company

1:14:10.273 --> 1:14:15.451
that the basic contract
which record companies used
was invalid.

1:14:15.589 --> 1:14:18.764
RUSSELL:
If you really fall out
with the people

1:14:18.902 --> 1:14:21.871
who control
your professional life,

1:14:23.838 --> 1:14:25.737
you have a right to walk away.

1:14:25.875 --> 1:14:28.360
I think that is the right
of every individual.

1:14:28.498 --> 1:14:34.780
And the music industry
takes away that right
from every artist it signs.

1:14:34.918 --> 1:14:36.230
George is very, very brave.

1:14:36.368 --> 1:14:38.025
He's not afraid of anybody.

1:14:38.163 --> 1:14:40.199
And he thought
he was being wronged

1:14:40.337 --> 1:14:41.822
and he went out
and fought his own corner.

1:14:41.960 --> 1:14:47.655
What we couldn't do was stand up
and say, "Yeah, you're right.

1:14:47.793 --> 1:14:53.143
"These contracts are slavery
and they shouldn't be allowed,
Your Honor."

1:14:53.281 --> 1:14:54.731
We weren't going to do that!

1:14:54.869 --> 1:14:58.494
You would have artist
after artist queuing up

1:14:58.632 --> 1:15:00.219
to take their record company
into court.

1:15:03.119 --> 1:15:05.708
MICHAEL:
I can't think of one artist
that supported me.

1:15:06.260 --> 1:15:08.193
Not one.

1:15:08.331 --> 1:15:13.474
I know of a lot of artists
who sat back
and waited for the result.

1:15:14.958 --> 1:15:16.339
But that's a different thing.

1:15:18.755 --> 1:15:22.966
ANDY STEPHENS:
Artists like George Michael
come along, if you're lucky,

1:15:23.103 --> 1:15:25.003
once-in-a-lifetime.

1:15:25.141 --> 1:15:29.663
My feelings as the court case
went on were
that we'd lost him.

1:15:29.800 --> 1:15:32.079
How could you ever patch
that up?

1:15:32.217 --> 1:15:36.290
I'd never let on to George
of the problems

1:15:36.428 --> 1:15:38.499
until after
he'd been in the witness box.

1:15:38.637 --> 1:15:40.984
And I said,
"It's not going well."

1:15:41.121 --> 1:15:45.610
And, you know, you shouldn't
raise your hopes at this stage.

1:15:59.382 --> 1:16:02.419
The pop star George Michael
loses his High Court battle

1:16:02.558 --> 1:16:05.112
to break away from
his record company, Sony.

1:16:05.250 --> 1:16:08.253
In dismissing the claim,
the judge, Mr. Justice Parker,

1:16:08.391 --> 1:16:12.084
ruled that the contract
was both reasonable and fair.

1:16:12.222 --> 1:16:14.639
The 30-year-old singer
had argued
that the agreement

1:16:14.777 --> 1:16:17.055
was stifling
his artistic development

1:16:17.193 --> 1:16:20.714
and he threatened never
to record for Sony again
if he lost.

1:16:20.852 --> 1:16:23.717
George Michael says
he'll appeal
against the judgment,

1:16:23.855 --> 1:16:26.960
which he said condemned him
to "professional slavery."

1:16:34.279 --> 1:16:38.973
Having received this judgment,
I would like to reiterate
the reasons why

1:16:39.111 --> 1:16:40.871
I embarked
upon these proceedings.

1:16:41.804 --> 1:16:44.392
I have no right to resign.

1:16:44.530 --> 1:16:50.847
In fact, there is no such thing
as resignation for an artist
in the music industry.

1:16:50.985 --> 1:16:55.714
Effectively, you sign a piece
of paper
at the beginning of your career

1:16:55.852 --> 1:16:58.544
and you are expected
to live with that decision,

1:16:58.683 --> 1:17:03.273
good or bad, for the rest
of your professional life.

1:17:03.411 --> 1:17:06.414
I shall obviously take full
advice from my lawyers.

1:17:06.552 --> 1:17:10.073
But the initial view is that
we have very strong grounds
for appeal

1:17:10.210 --> 1:17:13.939
and we hope to have the appeal
heard as quickly as possible.

1:17:14.077 --> 1:17:16.355
Thank you very much for your
time and for all the support

1:17:16.493 --> 1:17:19.358
that I've received since this
action began. Thank you.

1:17:22.085 --> 1:17:23.915
JOURNALIST: George,
will you sing for Sony again?

1:17:33.889 --> 1:17:36.582
After the court case
was finished and I'd lost

1:17:36.721 --> 1:17:39.550
and not just lost,
I lost completely.

1:17:39.689 --> 1:17:41.208
I mean, I lost on everything.

1:17:41.346 --> 1:17:43.175
Every count.

1:17:43.313 --> 1:17:46.005
They then called up and,
you know, kind of said,
"Well, isn't...

1:17:46.144 --> 1:17:47.559
Can't we patch things up?"
kind of thing.

1:17:47.697 --> 1:17:49.803
But I knew in reality
that was like a formality.

1:17:49.941 --> 1:17:51.148
They had to do that.

1:17:52.702 --> 1:17:56.154
But ultimately, the whole thing
was a complete waste of time.

1:17:56.291 --> 1:17:59.260
And I regret it to this day.

1:18:01.297 --> 1:18:05.957
Looking back 25 years on,
my first thought is that
I just think it's sad.

1:18:06.094 --> 1:18:09.512
When you win a court case,
you're normally out there
high-fiving

1:18:09.650 --> 1:18:11.478
and putting the drinks in.

1:18:11.617 --> 1:18:15.621
But I don't think anyone felt,
not on my team anyway,
a sense of euphoria.

1:18:15.760 --> 1:18:17.831
Certainly, there
were no winners.

1:18:17.969 --> 1:18:21.005
I mean, we won the court case,
but we didn't win anything.

1:18:21.144 --> 1:18:25.735
You've actually lost
because you've lost the support
of that artist.

1:18:25.873 --> 1:18:30.947
TONY: George said in passing,
"David Frost wants to do
an interview with me."

1:18:31.085 --> 1:18:32.811
And I said,
"You've got to do it.

1:18:32.949 --> 1:18:35.365
They know you're a man
of principle.

1:18:35.503 --> 1:18:39.680
Now, you've got to be a man
of principle
who's totally obsessed."

1:18:41.958 --> 1:18:43.063
Well...

1:18:44.754 --> 1:18:46.791
What happens now
is that we go to appeal.

1:18:46.929 --> 1:18:49.276
I can't see
any other way around it.

1:18:49.414 --> 1:18:51.243
I mean, of course,
there is the ultimate option

1:18:51.380 --> 1:18:55.489
that an appeal at the House
of Lords,
which would take forever.

1:18:55.627 --> 1:18:57.111
It was all bluff.

1:18:57.249 --> 1:19:02.392
I mean, they intended to take it
to the Court of Appeal
in the UK.

1:19:02.530 --> 1:19:06.431
Never to the House of Lords,
never to the European Court
of Justice.

1:19:06.568 --> 1:19:09.952
They can only lose
by going to appeal.

1:19:10.090 --> 1:19:11.746
Everybody was watching,

1:19:13.438 --> 1:19:15.302
including David Geffen.

1:19:15.440 --> 1:19:18.925
No-one was going to let a talent
like that flounder out there
for very long.

1:19:19.064 --> 1:19:24.690
So, David Geffen
contacts Sony
and said to them,

1:19:24.829 --> 1:19:26.554
"Listen, guys,

1:19:26.692 --> 1:19:32.698
he's never, ever going to make
another piece of music
for you ever."

1:19:32.837 --> 1:19:34.252
"You might as well let him go."

1:19:38.739 --> 1:19:41.327
I flew to New York,
had a very quick
meeting there,

1:19:41.466 --> 1:19:44.987
where basically, you know,
we agreed that the contract
would be sold.

1:19:45.125 --> 1:19:47.644
I was like in seventh heaven.

1:19:47.782 --> 1:19:51.200
TONY: Sony said,
"We want
this transfer fee" and

1:19:51.338 --> 1:19:53.754
it would've bought you
a top class footballer.

1:19:53.892 --> 1:19:56.481
In fact, it most probably
even bought you Lionel Messi
in those days.

1:19:56.619 --> 1:20:01.210
RUSSELL: In the end, he did
whatever he did
with David Geffen and Virgin

1:20:01.348 --> 1:20:04.903
and basically
he bought himself
out of the contract.

1:20:05.041 --> 1:20:07.906
Was it a good decision
in hindsight of history?

1:20:08.044 --> 1:20:09.287
I'm not sure.

1:20:09.425 --> 1:20:14.844
George unquestionably
lost the battle but won the war.

1:20:14.982 --> 1:20:17.088
Because he got the freedom
that he craved for.

1:20:17.226 --> 1:20:18.710
'Cause he felt he had
to get away.

1:20:23.577 --> 1:20:25.130
Peace to George Michael.

1:20:28.168 --> 1:20:29.272
Peace.

1:20:35.139 --> 1:20:40.076
MICHAEL:
I think the whole experience
of losing Anselmo,

1:20:40.214 --> 1:20:42.976
the period of grief,
roughly two years,

1:20:43.114 --> 1:20:44.874
that I didn't write a note
of music...

1:20:45.771 --> 1:20:48.636
And then,
the absolute knowledge

1:20:48.773 --> 1:20:51.156
that the next album
I was going to write

1:20:51.294 --> 1:20:54.159
would be about grief
and recovery.

1:20:56.264 --> 1:21:00.234
Older is my greatest moment.

1:21:00.994 --> 1:21:03.686
♪ Kindness

1:21:03.824 --> 1:21:09.139
♪ In your eyes I guess

1:21:09.278 --> 1:21:11.936

1:21:12.074 --> 1:21:14.835
♪ You smiled at me

1:21:14.973 --> 1:21:19.564
♪ Like Jesus to a child

1:21:22.014 --> 1:21:24.465
I sat at a keyboard,

1:21:28.262 --> 1:21:31.541
played a very simple
string part,

1:21:34.475 --> 1:21:38.617
added a very,
very gentle guitar part.

1:21:38.755 --> 1:21:41.897
And my way of making music
is very strange.

1:21:42.035 --> 1:21:44.037
It's very strange.

1:21:44.175 --> 1:21:47.937
Generally, I put
my backing tracks together
very simply on keyboards.

1:21:51.320 --> 1:21:54.633
In this case, I think,
I've added a little guitar.

1:21:57.188 --> 1:22:00.225
But the moment I think
there is something coming,

1:22:00.362 --> 1:22:02.745
there is something
important coming,

1:22:02.883 --> 1:22:08.061
I shove everybody
out of the room, I go in.

1:22:09.925 --> 1:22:14.999
And then I just sing
on repeat, repeat,
repeat, repeat.

1:22:17.277 --> 1:22:20.073
I sing, and I sing,
and I sing.

1:22:20.210 --> 1:22:24.387
This whole total stream
of consciousness rubbish

1:22:24.525 --> 1:22:29.875
that people would laugh
their heads off if they heard
what I was singing.

1:22:32.671 --> 1:22:37.193
And then, I sang
"Like Jesus to a Child".

1:22:40.196 --> 1:22:41.370
Simple as that.

1:22:44.960 --> 1:22:48.308
And I thought, "Oh, my God.

1:22:48.791 --> 1:22:49.895
That's him.

1:22:50.034 --> 1:22:52.036
That's him and me.

1:22:53.175 --> 1:22:55.004
Like Jesus to a child."

1:23:00.216 --> 1:23:03.840
Then I was so excited
that I'd finally
been able to put my feelings

1:23:03.978 --> 1:23:05.981
about Anselmo into words.

1:23:08.673 --> 1:23:10.639
And within a week
of writing it,

1:23:10.778 --> 1:23:13.228
I was singing it in front
of the Brandenburg Gate,

1:23:13.367 --> 1:23:16.232
playing my first kind
of public tribute
to him there.

1:23:18.476 --> 1:23:21.134
♪ Well, I've been loved

1:23:21.272 --> 1:23:26.862

and their pains
to really help people to heal.

1:24:10.424 --> 1:24:17.017
MICHAEL:
I think I wrote the best,
most healing piece of music.

1:24:17.155 --> 1:24:19.364

And you know,
"Fast Love" makes me laugh,

1:24:48.807 --> 1:24:52.190
