34:46.626 --> 34:49.337
[laughs]

34:50.880 --> 34:53.883
- You're The Ultra-Humanite.

34:53.925 --> 34:57.929
- Well, bingo.

35:00.765 --> 35:02.475
- Where's Sylvester?

35:02.517 --> 35:06.104
- Oh, Dr. McNider was right
about the cosmic energy

35:06.145 --> 35:07.939
preserving the body.

35:07.980 --> 35:12.068
But Sylvester's brain,
mmm, that's long gone.

35:13.027 --> 35:15.321
We had some fun,
didn't we, Pat?

35:15.363 --> 35:18.241
Back in the old days?

35:18.282 --> 35:20.660
Star-Spangled Kid
and Stripesy

35:20.701 --> 35:23.788
alongside
the Seven Soldiers of Victory.

35:23.830 --> 35:25.790
Huzzah!
[chuckling]

35:25.832 --> 35:27.708
- What the hell
are you talking about?

35:27.750 --> 35:30.795
- Oh, you remember.
After Ted gave me the Staff,

35:30.837 --> 35:34.715
it was Starman and the JSA.

35:34.757 --> 35:36.217
Those are the big leagues.

35:36.259 --> 35:40.930
And now,
Starman and S.T.R.I.P.E.

35:40.972 --> 35:45.309
We made a real team again.
These were great times.

35:45.351 --> 35:51.607
I'm sad we won't
have that anymore, 'cause...

35:51.649 --> 35:53.818
you're my friend,

35:53.860 --> 35:56.112
my brother.

35:57.989 --> 36:00.908
I'm sorry it has
to end like this.

36:03.286 --> 36:05.663
- You're not Sylvester.

36:05.705 --> 36:09.167
- Oh...ha. Right.

36:09.208 --> 36:11.377
Yes, of course.

36:11.419 --> 36:14.255
Yeah, sometimes I get lost
in the role.

36:14.297 --> 36:16.841
I just forget.

36:16.883 --> 36:19.051
- Ugh!

36:19.635 --> 36:24.974
Wait a second! Hold on!
Stop it! Hold on a second!

36:25.016 --> 36:29.645
Hold on.
You don't have to do this.

36:32.523 --> 36:35.651
Sylvester...

36:35.693 --> 36:39.363
you're my friend, right?

36:40.406 --> 36:43.326
- That's right, Pat.
- Right.

36:43.367 --> 36:50.249
So--so it's not happening
like this, okay?

36:50.291 --> 36:52.710
Help me outta here.

36:54.795 --> 36:56.422
- Okay.

36:59.884 --> 37:04.597
- Yeah, there you go.
Come on. Yeah.

37:04.639 --> 37:10.228
Just grab on.
Come on, you can do it.

37:17.985 --> 37:19.570
Come on.

37:21.656 --> 37:24.533
- Oh, that was good, Pat.

37:24.575 --> 37:27.870
That was really good.

37:27.912 --> 37:29.997
You almost had me.

37:39.507 --> 37:42.009
- You're insane.

37:43.594 --> 37:45.972
- I know.

37:46.013 --> 37:48.849
- [grunting]

37:51.769 --> 37:55.231
- It's a beautiful night.

37:55.273 --> 38:01.070
For decades, I enjoyed
being in that beast...

38:01.112 --> 38:03.823
that's been
roaming these woods.

38:09.203 --> 38:11.956
And just the raw strength...

38:14.917 --> 38:17.378
Helped me survive
the JSA attacks

38:17.420 --> 38:20.506
one after the other.

38:20.548 --> 38:25.594
But being in that monster,
I had to stay hidden.

38:25.636 --> 38:28.264
I grew tired of hiding.

38:28.306 --> 38:31.767
I missed the adulation
that Dolores Winters got.

38:33.519 --> 38:36.522
I wanted that again.

38:36.564 --> 38:38.524
Like, I know Jordan and
Dr. Ito may have other plans.

38:38.566 --> 38:43.654
But for me,
that's what this is all about.

38:45.781 --> 38:50.578
So after the operation,

38:50.619 --> 38:53.414
I did some traveling.

38:53.456 --> 38:55.708
I did my research.

38:55.750 --> 38:57.168
- [grunts]
Ah--

38:57.209 --> 38:59.503
- I talked
to almost everyone you knew,

38:59.545 --> 39:01.756
from your landlord
in Van Nuys...

39:04.884 --> 39:07.053
To Mike's mom.

39:07.094 --> 39:08.804
When I finally made
my way to you,

39:08.846 --> 39:12.391
I was more than ready
to play that role.

39:12.433 --> 39:15.478
And I was accepted back
so quickly

39:15.519 --> 39:19.065
because everyone
worshipped Starman...

39:19.106 --> 39:21.442
especially you.

39:23.611 --> 39:26.614
But I had to cement
that acceptance.

39:26.655 --> 39:30.826
So I made myself a victim

39:30.868 --> 39:32.995
with the help of some friends.

39:33.037 --> 39:35.456
[snarling]

39:42.797 --> 39:46.675
You brought me into
the circle of trust, Pat.

39:46.717 --> 39:49.345
And you brought me
closer to Courtney.

39:49.387 --> 39:54.600
And more importantly, to my
ultimate prize, the Staff.

39:56.268 --> 39:59.313
So I not only bonded
with all of you,

39:59.355 --> 40:01.065
I bonded with it.

40:01.107 --> 40:03.651
And thanks to Courtney,

40:03.692 --> 40:07.822
the bond with the Staff
is now complete.

40:07.863 --> 40:10.366
At the same time,
I had to make sure

40:10.408 --> 40:12.785
Courtney's friends
stayed out of my way

40:12.827 --> 40:15.663
because if anyone
saw through my disguise,

40:15.704 --> 40:17.957
it would be Cindy Burman.

40:17.998 --> 40:20.543
So I used Yolanda
to push her away.

40:20.584 --> 40:22.878
The way you don't let
Dragon King's kid off the hook,

40:22.920 --> 40:25.631
it's very Ted.
It's good judgment.

40:25.673 --> 40:28.175
And then I urged Beth
to cut off her parents

40:28.217 --> 40:29.927
to keep her distracted.

40:29.969 --> 40:33.139
First rule I have--
protect the family.

40:34.223 --> 40:36.976
And Rick...ha ha.

40:37.017 --> 40:40.396
Rex Tyler's
angry little brute.

40:40.438 --> 40:42.523
I mean, we all know
what Rex went through

40:42.565 --> 40:44.859
before he set a limiter
on that hourglass.

40:44.900 --> 40:49.363
So, oh, I'd hate to be
Rick right now.

40:49.405 --> 40:52.616
He must be in a world of pain.

40:52.658 --> 40:57.455
And finally...your son.

40:57.955 --> 41:00.708
I told Mike to go prove
he could do

41:00.749 --> 41:04.086
what you said he couldn't.

41:04.128 --> 41:06.046
And then I put him
and his inept friend

41:06.088 --> 41:08.716
with the pen in harm's way.

41:10.259 --> 41:12.219
That worked out great.

41:13.471 --> 41:17.808
It all worked out...

41:17.850 --> 41:20.478
and so will
the rest of our plan.

41:23.856 --> 41:26.734
You wanna hear
Jordan's endgame, Pat?

41:29.737 --> 41:31.363
Pat?

41:31.405 --> 41:34.366
[dark music]

41:34.408 --> 41:36.660
Oh.

41:42.791 --> 41:45.294
Bye, Pat.

41:53.177 --> 41:57.890
[intense musical buildup]

42:20.246 --> 42:21.372
- Greg, move your head.
