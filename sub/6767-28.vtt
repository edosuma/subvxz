00:03.294 --> 00:06.881
(phone ringing)

00:06.965 --> 00:07.757
Hello?

00:07.841 --> 00:10.427
Donna, hey, what are you
doing right now?

00:10.510 --> 00:11.428
Hey, you know that project

00:11.511 --> 00:13.054
I had for Langley's class

00:13.138 --> 00:14.431
where I have to create
a business plan

00:14.514 --> 00:15.932
for a new sportswear line?

00:16.015 --> 00:17.434
Yeah, you've been
stressing over it for weeks.

00:17.517 --> 00:19.269
Well, you can congratulate me

00:19.352 --> 00:20.395
because I just finished it,

00:20.478 --> 00:21.438
and I don't even have to

00:21.521 --> 00:22.230
present it in class
till tomorrow.

00:22.313 --> 00:24.065
What? That's great.

00:24.149 --> 00:24.733
That's perfect timing.

00:24.816 --> 00:25.275
Look, I want to take you out

00:25.358 --> 00:26.276
to celebrate tonight.

00:26.359 --> 00:28.445
I have two tickets
to a great club.

00:28.528 --> 00:29.446
Okay, yeah, I'd love to go.

00:29.529 --> 00:30.655
I could really use a night out.

00:30.739 --> 00:31.781
Where are we going?

00:31.865 --> 00:33.283
New Orleans.

00:33.366 --> 00:34.784
Where?

00:34.868 --> 00:36.619
New Orleans, you know?

00:36.703 --> 00:38.121
Jambalaya, crawfish pie,
fillet gumbo?

00:38.204 --> 00:39.789
You must be kidding.

00:39.873 --> 00:41.291
Donna, I swear,
I have two tickets waiting

00:41.374 --> 00:42.459
at the airport right now.

00:42.542 --> 00:44.169
David, I have to present
my project in class tomorrow.

00:44.252 --> 00:46.421
I can't miss that.

00:46.504 --> 00:48.298
Donna, I can have you
back by tomorrow.

00:48.381 --> 00:50.467
Okay, slow down here.

00:50.550 --> 00:51.885
What is this all about?

00:51.968 --> 00:53.970
I booked Monica to perform
at the club next week.

00:54.053 --> 00:55.472
And her people
want to meet with me

00:55.555 --> 00:57.182
to go over last-minute
business stuff.

00:57.265 --> 00:59.267
But they're in New Orleans
for the Jazz Festival.

00:59.350 --> 01:01.436
So, they set me up
with two first class tickets,

01:01.519 --> 01:02.353
dinner, hotel, the whole nine.

01:02.437 --> 01:05.607
Mmm, sounds great, but I can't.

01:05.690 --> 01:07.484
Donna, I can pick you up
today after Langely's class

01:07.567 --> 01:09.277
and have you back in time
for the one tomorrow.

01:09.360 --> 01:10.695
I mean, with
the time difference,

01:10.779 --> 01:12.113
the flight takes no time at all.

01:12.197 --> 01:13.490
Have you ever been
to New Orleans?

01:13.573 --> 01:15.492
Once and it was amazing.

01:15.575 --> 01:16.493
I loved it.

01:16.576 --> 01:17.660
Well, I never have.

01:17.744 --> 01:20.121
And I'd really like
to go with you.

01:20.205 --> 01:23.041
Come on, Donna,
just one great night

01:23.124 --> 01:24.501
in the Big Easy.

01:24.584 --> 01:25.418
Last chance.

01:26.419 --> 01:29.839
What is it that they, uh...

01:29.923 --> 01:31.341
they say in New Orleans?

01:31.424 --> 01:34.344
"Let the <i> bon temps roullez."</i>

01:34.427 --> 01:36.471
Is that a yes?

01:36.554 --> 01:38.306
It sure is.

01:38.389 --> 01:39.933
It's Cajun for
"Let the good times roll."

01:40.016 --> 01:41.309
Great.

01:41.392 --> 01:43.895
Great. Uh, I'll see you later.

01:43.978 --> 01:45.522
I can't wait. Bye!

01:45.605 --> 01:47.106
Bye.

01:48.274 --> 01:49.275

03:46.559 --> 03:48.811
and my head aches

"aloha" to the Hawaiian flu.

What's that?
It's a flu.

{\an3}It's going
around school.

it's short lived.

and make you some tea.

04:08.247 --> 04:10.166
You are?

04:10.249 --> 04:12.168
That's so sweet.

04:12.251 --> 04:14.545

What is <i> The Hartley House?</i>

04:27.558 --> 04:29.018
{\an3}Very good!
You're correct!

04:29.102 --> 04:30.853
{\an1}And what is
the sudden attack

04:30.937 --> 04:32.647
{\an1}of nostalgia
all about, my friend?

04:32.730 --> 04:33.856
{\an3}Oh, you didn't forget
about tonight?

04:33.940 --> 04:36.526
The Institute of Broadcasting's
tribute to my mom's show?

04:36.609 --> 04:37.527
She's flying in.

04:37.610 --> 04:39.654
You're right-- I totally forgot.

04:39.737 --> 04:41.030
Sorry.

04:41.114 --> 04:41.698
Aw, Bran, you're
gonna be there, right?

04:41.781 --> 04:44.075
Yeah. Yeah, I'll be there.

04:44.158 --> 04:46.202
Unfortunately, Kelly's
on the disabled list.

04:46.286 --> 04:47.370
Sick as a dog.

04:47.453 --> 04:48.162
That flu thing?

04:48.246 --> 04:49.330
Yep.

04:49.414 --> 04:50.373
{\an3}Man, that bug's
been going through

04:50.456 --> 04:51.541
the KEG house faster
than last year's midterms.

04:51.624 --> 04:53.501
You know, maybe
I should stay at Clare's house.

04:53.584 --> 04:55.420
If I get sick,
my mother's gonna kill me.

04:55.503 --> 04:57.839
Steve, it's not that contagious.

04:57.922 --> 04:58.673
(sneezes)

04:58.756 --> 05:00.591
VAL (groans):
Good morning.

05:00.675 --> 05:02.510
Yeah. Apparently not.

05:02.593 --> 05:03.553
{\an3}I hope you're
feeling better, Val.

05:03.636 --> 05:06.055
Oh, thanks.

05:06.139 --> 05:08.057
Hey, Val, why
don't you, uh,

05:08.141 --> 05:09.517
go back to bed, I'll
bring you some tea.

05:09.600 --> 05:11.561
{\an3}Are you making tea?
Yeah.

05:11.644 --> 05:13.604
Kelly's got it, too.

05:14.772 --> 05:17.066
Oh, great--
<i>that's</i> who I got it from.

05:17.150 --> 05:18.526
At least now you can't say
she never gave you nothing.

05:18.609 --> 05:21.696
(groans)

05:23.990 --> 05:24.741
...and the percentage of markup

05:24.824 --> 05:26.576
is designed
to be flexible enough

05:26.659 --> 05:30.288
to reflect the requirements
of different retailers.

05:30.371 --> 05:31.330
That's it.

05:31.414 --> 05:33.541
{\an4}PROFESSOR:
So, Ms. Fogarty,
what you're telling me

05:33.624 --> 05:36.085
is that you can't project a
profit margin with any accuracy.

05:36.169 --> 05:38.588
{\an1}And you expect a bank
to finance you on that basis.

05:38.671 --> 05:39.547
Good luck.

05:39.630 --> 05:41.591
I, uh...

05:41.674 --> 05:43.885
I guess I didn't
think about that.

05:43.968 --> 05:45.261
Famous last words.

05:45.970 --> 05:47.263
That's all for today.

05:48.306 --> 05:49.599
{\an3}DONNA:
Hey.

05:49.682 --> 05:52.560
{\an3}I thought the price policy
was a great idea.

05:52.643 --> 05:53.561
Thanks, Donna.

05:53.644 --> 05:55.313
Hold on, everyone.

05:55.396 --> 05:56.898
I must say,
I am very disappointed

05:56.981 --> 05:58.024
with the general level

05:58.107 --> 06:00.109
of presentations
on these projects.

06:00.193 --> 06:01.235
Miss Martin,

06:01.319 --> 06:02.570
you're next, am I right?
Yes.

06:02.653 --> 06:04.906
Then I wouldn't waste time
chattering if I were you.

06:04.989 --> 06:06.741
{\an1}You have to conserve
your energy.

06:06.824 --> 06:09.118
You'll probably be up all night
completing the assignment.

06:09.202 --> 06:10.244
That's if you've even begun.

06:10.328 --> 06:13.122
Actually, Professor Langely,
I've already finished.

06:13.206 --> 06:14.791
I'll be ready for tomorrow.

06:14.874 --> 06:15.625
Good. Looking forward to it.

06:15.708 --> 06:16.626
{\an3}Thanks.

06:16.709 --> 06:19.003
Okay, everybody.
Thank you.

06:20.713 --> 06:22.799
(sighs):
Bye.

06:22.882 --> 06:24.634
{\an3}Good luck tomorrow.
Thanks.

06:24.717 --> 06:26.636
{\an3}Let's go-- we've got
a plane to catch.

06:26.719 --> 06:27.762
(groans)

06:27.845 --> 06:29.180
What's wrong?

06:29.263 --> 06:31.474
Professor Langley--
she is so horrible.

06:31.557 --> 06:32.975
Donna, would you stop

06:33.059 --> 06:34.352
worrying about her?

06:34.435 --> 06:35.645
Come on, we have places
to go and fun to have.

06:35.728 --> 06:38.189
{\an3}Besides, I thought
you said you had

06:38.272 --> 06:40.149
{\an3}everything all together
and finished for tomorrow.

06:40.233 --> 06:41.484
Well, I'm not sure anymore.

06:41.567 --> 06:42.610
{\an1}I mean, she's tough
on everybody--

06:42.693 --> 06:43.653
{\an1}but me, she has
it in for me.

06:43.736 --> 06:46.656
{\an3}How could anybody
not like Donna Martin?

06:46.739 --> 06:48.991
I don't know.

06:49.075 --> 06:50.993
{\an3}I know I'm crazy
about her.

06:51.077 --> 06:52.662
Mm...

06:56.666 --> 06:58.292
Oh, great.

06:58.376 --> 06:59.210
(exhales)

06:59.293 --> 07:01.796
That's why I'm taking you
to New Orleans.

07:01.879 --> 07:03.631
{\an1}Hey, Clare.
Hey.

07:03.714 --> 07:05.508
{\an3}I just dropped my mom
off at the hotel,

07:05.591 --> 07:07.218
and, boy, is she excited!

07:07.301 --> 07:08.344
Well, she should be.

07:08.427 --> 07:11.013
The Institute of TV
and Broadcasting Hall of Fame--

07:11.097 --> 07:12.181
{\an1}it's a big honor.
Yeah.

07:12.265 --> 07:14.517
I mean, you don't see them
celebrating <i> Knight Rider.</i>

07:14.600 --> 07:17.562
Well, they did that
last year. Mm-hmm.

07:17.645 --> 07:19.564
{\an1}My dad is so excited
to see your mom.

07:19.647 --> 07:22.400
{\an1}His happiness level
rises about 300%

07:22.483 --> 07:24.193
every time she comes to town.

07:24.277 --> 07:25.319
{\an3}Well, that's a
Sanders trait, Clare.

07:25.403 --> 07:27.989
{\an3}I notice you get excited
every time I walk in the room.

07:28.072 --> 07:30.491
{\an3}You think I could spend the
next couple days with you

07:30.575 --> 07:32.535
{\an5}over at the
beach house?
Yeah. Why?

07:32.618 --> 07:34.871
Well, it seems Valerie and Kelly
have a little bug.

07:34.954 --> 07:37.707
I don't want to get sick.
Oh. Yeah, no problem.

07:37.790 --> 07:40.334
{\an1}Oh, by the way, my Dad
wants the four of us

07:40.418 --> 07:41.794
to go together tonight.
That's fine by me.

07:42.795 --> 07:45.506
They do make a great couple.

07:45.590 --> 07:47.633
{\an3}Yes, they do make
a great couple.

07:47.717 --> 07:49.135
{\an3}You were against it
at the beginning, too.

07:49.218 --> 07:51.137
I know, I know-- I was wrong.

07:51.220 --> 07:52.889
Mm-hmm.
My dad is so cute.

07:52.972 --> 07:55.558
All he talks about is your mom.
(chuckles)

07:55.641 --> 07:57.685
{\an1}I guess she's the same
about him, huh?

07:57.768 --> 07:59.687
{\an3}Actually, she hasn't
mentioned him.

07:59.770 --> 08:01.689
Really? That's kind of weird.

08:01.772 --> 08:03.566
They haven't seen each other
in, like, weeks.

08:03.649 --> 08:05.693
Yeah, that is kind of odd.

08:05.776 --> 08:06.736
Ah, maybe it's
the excitement of the night.

08:06.819 --> 08:09.030
Yeah, probably.

08:09.113 --> 08:11.115
{\an3}You're not trying to
start trouble, are you?

08:11.199 --> 08:12.533
(sighs):
No.

08:12.617 --> 08:13.701
I'm just looking out
for my daddy.

08:13.784 --> 08:14.744
{\an3}Cool.

08:14.827 --> 08:17.747
KELLY (calls):
Brandon, is that you?

08:17.830 --> 08:18.706
Sure is.

08:18.789 --> 08:21.584
Can you bring me up
some orange juice?

08:21.667 --> 08:23.294
Absolutely.

08:23.377 --> 08:24.712
Brandon,
did you get my juice, too?

08:24.795 --> 08:27.632
Yes, I did. Just a minute.

08:27.715 --> 08:28.758
{\an6}VALERIE:
Well, did you
get grapefruit?

08:28.841 --> 08:32.385
Yes. Will you hold on?

08:36.349 --> 08:38.267
What took you so long?

08:38.351 --> 08:39.727
{\an1}There was a big line
at the pharmacy.

08:39.809 --> 08:42.647
{\an1}Everyone was buying
tissues and cough syrup.

08:42.730 --> 08:45.107
{\an1}(groans)
Feeling better?

08:45.191 --> 08:47.276
{\an3}I wish. You know,
I don't think

08:47.360 --> 08:48.736
there's any way
I'm gonna be able

08:48.819 --> 08:50.780
to drag myself
to Steve's thing tonight.

08:50.863 --> 08:51.781
That's all right, we'll stay
home-- he won't miss us.

08:51.864 --> 08:54.742
No, you should go. I'm fine.

08:54.825 --> 08:55.952
{\an3}You sure?
Yeah.

08:56.035 --> 08:57.954
I'll be in bed by 8:00, anyway.

08:58.037 --> 08:58.788
Did you get me anything to read?

08:58.871 --> 09:00.790
You bet.

09:00.873 --> 09:03.125
{\an3}I don't read
tabloids.

09:03.209 --> 09:04.627
{\an1}Whoa. Those are
for Valerie.

09:04.710 --> 09:05.628
These fashion magazines

09:05.711 --> 09:07.004
{\an1}are for you.
Mm.

09:09.048 --> 09:10.633
I realize that I'm
the second-class patient here,

09:10.716 --> 09:12.593
but can I please get my juice?

09:12.677 --> 09:15.471
You bet. I even got you
your favorite reading material.

09:15.554 --> 09:18.349
{\an3}"Aliens bring intergalactic
dating tips to U.N."

09:18.432 --> 09:20.142
{\an3}Fascinating stuff.
Thank you.

09:20.226 --> 09:21.978
Oh, I ran out of tissues, too.

09:22.061 --> 09:22.812
{\an1}Did you get some more?
Yes.

09:22.895 --> 09:26.190
{\an6}KELLY:
I thought they
were for me.

09:26.274 --> 09:28.150
That's why I got two boxes.

09:28.234 --> 09:29.819
Let go.

09:31.779 --> 09:33.197
{\an1}Thank you.

09:33.281 --> 09:34.240
You're welcome.

09:34.323 --> 09:34.699
{\an1}Kelly, I hope
you feel better.

09:34.782 --> 09:36.951
You, too.

09:43.749 --> 09:45.501
{\an6}(sighs)
Like she cares
about me.

09:45.584 --> 09:45.918
Aw, come on, Kel,

09:46.002 --> 09:46.794
she's trying.

09:46.877 --> 09:49.380
Mm. Only when you're around.

09:52.591 --> 09:54.510
CLARE:
<i>Bathroom's free.</i>

09:54.593 --> 09:56.262
{\an3}Now, that's something
you don't hear very often

09:56.345 --> 09:58.014
in this place.
Yeah. This place is empty.

09:58.097 --> 09:59.140
I can't believe David

09:59.223 --> 10:00.683
and Donna went
to New Orleans

10:00.766 --> 10:01.851
just for one night.
I know.

10:01.934 --> 10:03.853
It's so romantic.

10:03.936 --> 10:05.855
How come we never do
anything like that?

10:05.938 --> 10:08.190
{\an1}Oh, honey, we don't
need romance.

10:08.274 --> 10:09.734
We <i> have</i> sex.

10:09.817 --> 10:10.776
(doorbell rings)
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

10:10.860 --> 10:12.903
It's probably them.

10:16.949 --> 10:20.536
Hello, sw...
Oh, you look wonderful!

10:20.620 --> 10:21.996
{\an3}Thanks. So do you.
Evening, Steve.

10:22.079 --> 10:23.706
Hi, Chancellor. Where's my mom?

10:23.789 --> 10:24.957
{\an1}She, uh... made
other arrangements.

10:27.251 --> 10:29.253
{\an3}I thought we were all
gonna go together.

10:29.337 --> 10:30.546
Change of plans.

10:30.629 --> 10:32.214
{\an1}Uh, the network
sent a limo

10:32.298 --> 10:33.883
{\an3}for her and the
other stars.

10:33.966 --> 10:36.802
{\an1}Apparently, there's
some kind of pre-event

10:36.886 --> 10:39.221
{\an1}publicity they...
had to do. I...

10:39.305 --> 10:41.432
Show business.
Huh, got to love it.

10:41.515 --> 10:43.434
{\an1}It would seem so.
You know what?

10:43.517 --> 10:44.769
I'm gonna use the bathroom
before we leave.

10:44.852 --> 10:45.895
{\an1}Excuse me.

10:45.978 --> 10:47.855
{\an3}You should have
just called--

10:47.938 --> 10:49.732
{\an3}we could've met you
at the institute.

10:49.815 --> 10:52.068
{\an1}I didn't know till
I went to her hotel.

10:52.151 --> 10:52.860
She didn't call?

10:52.943 --> 10:55.404
That's a bit rude.

10:55.488 --> 10:59.825
{\an1}Well, like Steve said:
show biz-- got to love it.

10:59.909 --> 11:01.577
Are you okay?

11:01.660 --> 11:03.079
Oh, yeah, fine.

11:03.162 --> 11:05.790
Everything good
between you two or...?

11:05.873 --> 11:09.251
Yeah, I... (chuckles)
I think so.

11:09.335 --> 11:10.920
I-I really don't have much
experience

11:11.003 --> 11:12.046
at this sort of thing.

11:12.129 --> 11:13.756
So what's bothering you?

11:13.839 --> 11:16.258
Well, I was reading

11:16.342 --> 11:17.551
some soap opera magazines.

11:17.635 --> 11:21.889
There's this hot new leading man
on the set of her soap opera.

11:21.972 --> 11:23.933
And the last few times I talked
to her on the telephone,

11:24.016 --> 11:27.228
she seemed kind of distant.

11:27.311 --> 11:29.230
{\an1}It was nothing
you could put your finger on.

11:29.313 --> 11:31.649
Wait a second. Back up a minute.
Since when

11:31.732 --> 11:32.274
do you read soap
opera magazines?

11:32.358 --> 11:34.110
Well, you have to keep up.

11:34.193 --> 11:35.361
That's what you do
in a relationship.

11:35.444 --> 11:39.824
Yeah, and I'm sure she reads
<i>Chancellor Digest,</i> right?

11:39.907 --> 11:41.617
Well, let's just drop it,
shall we?

11:41.700 --> 11:42.827
Tonight is Samantha's night,

11:42.910 --> 11:45.329
and I for one am not gonna
do anything to tarnish it.

11:45.413 --> 11:45.955
Tarnish what?

11:46.038 --> 11:48.457
Nothing.

11:48.541 --> 11:49.959
You guys ready?
Can we go?

11:50.042 --> 11:51.585
Yeah.
Yeah.

11:52.044 --> 11:54.839
Clare, what's going on?

11:54.922 --> 11:55.965
{\an3}Your mom's being rude
to my dad.

11:56.924 --> 12:02.263
And I don't like it one bit.

12:10.062 --> 12:12.356
(crowd chatter)

12:21.407 --> 12:24.869
Oh, this is beautiful.

12:24.952 --> 12:27.079
Yeah, it's amazing.

12:28.873 --> 12:29.832
{\an1}You know the guy
at the desk,

12:29.915 --> 12:31.417
he said this is the room

12:31.500 --> 12:34.003
where Tennessee Williams wrote
<i>A Streetcar Named Desire.</i>

12:34.086 --> 12:36.338
That's probably the
New Orleans version

12:36.422 --> 12:37.882
{\an5}of <i> George Washington</i>
<i>Slept Here.</i>
(laughs)

12:40.050 --> 12:42.344
Do you smell that?

12:42.428 --> 12:45.973
Mm, night-blooming jasmine.

12:46.056 --> 12:48.767
That's nice.

12:48.851 --> 12:50.352
I love this city.

12:50.436 --> 12:52.354
Thanks for bringing me here.

12:52.438 --> 12:54.190
{\an3}Well, thank you
for coming with me.

12:54.273 --> 12:56.150
You're welcome.

12:57.109 --> 12:59.028
{\an3}Now, Ms. Martin,
I hate to rush you,

12:59.111 --> 13:01.030
{\an3}but we do have dinner
reservations at K-Paul's.

13:01.113 --> 13:03.699
That's right.

13:03.782 --> 13:05.075
{\an3}Just give me
a couple of minutes.

13:05.159 --> 13:07.036
All rightie.

13:07.119 --> 13:10.039
{\an3}It's exciting going places
you've never been, isn't it?

13:10.122 --> 13:13.417
{\an1}Yeah, it is.
It's real exciting.

13:13.501 --> 13:14.543
Donna?

13:14.627 --> 13:16.670
{\an1}Look, um,

13:16.754 --> 13:17.922
I just want
to know that I tried

13:18.005 --> 13:21.050
to get a room with twin beds
in it, but they didn't have any.

13:21.133 --> 13:22.885
That's okay.

13:22.968 --> 13:24.887
The clerk said not too many

13:24.970 --> 13:26.055
people request them.

13:26.138 --> 13:27.890
I guess that's just what type
of city this is.

13:27.973 --> 13:29.391
It'll be fine.

13:29.475 --> 13:31.143
It's not like we haven't
shared a bed before.

14:00.714 --> 14:03.133
(TV playing)

14:03.217 --> 14:05.094
Ugh! You're here.

14:05.177 --> 14:06.095
Very observant.

14:06.178 --> 14:09.223
What are you watching?

14:09.306 --> 14:10.266
{\an1}<i>Heidi.</i>

14:10.349 --> 14:11.892
Is she your hero?

14:11.976 --> 14:14.103
No, I think you have
her confused

14:14.186 --> 14:15.604
with your hero, Heidi Fleiss.

14:15.688 --> 14:18.232
No, I don't admire anybody
who gets caught.

14:18.315 --> 14:19.608
Really?

14:19.692 --> 14:20.985
I would have thought
you'd admire someone

14:21.068 --> 14:22.987
who got paid
for what you give away.

14:23.070 --> 14:24.113
You know what, Kelly,

14:24.196 --> 14:27.449
I'm really sick
of your good girl act, okay?

14:27.533 --> 14:29.994
Everybody knows you that you're
ten times the tramp I was.

14:30.077 --> 14:31.120
Really?

14:31.203 --> 14:32.079
{\an6}Yeah.
All right,
I'm leaving.

14:32.162 --> 14:33.998
You two invalids
play nice, huh?

14:34.081 --> 14:35.874
And try not to kill each other
while I'm gone, huh?

14:35.958 --> 14:37.293
Don't worry about us.

14:37.376 --> 14:38.836
Yeah, we'll be fine.

14:38.919 --> 14:40.296
{\an3}I'm too weak
to fight anyways.

14:40.379 --> 14:41.297
Okay.

14:41.380 --> 14:43.132
{\an3}KELLY:
Have fun.

14:43.215 --> 14:44.925
{\an1}Tell Steve I'm sorry
I can't make it.

14:45.009 --> 14:45.926
{\an3}I will.

14:46.010 --> 14:46.927
{\an1}Bye.

14:47.011 --> 14:48.345
Good night, ladies.

14:50.222 --> 14:52.308
{\an4}(sighs)
You can watch TV
if you want.

14:52.391 --> 14:53.934
I'm not in the mood.

14:54.018 --> 14:55.060
Thank you very much.

14:55.144 --> 14:57.938
It's really gracious of you,
considering it is my house.

14:58.022 --> 15:01.275
Really? I thought
it was Brandon's.

15:09.241 --> 15:10.993
(lively chatter)

15:11.076 --> 15:12.995
{\an1}Good, good. Martin Burns,
this is Donna Martin.

15:13.078 --> 15:13.996
Hi, nice to meet you.

15:14.079 --> 15:14.663
Pleasure's mine.

15:14.747 --> 15:15.331
So, did you like K-Paul's?

15:15.414 --> 15:16.290
{\an1}Oh, yeah,
it was incredible.

15:16.373 --> 15:18.667
{\an3}My mouth's still burning
from the jambalaya.

15:18.751 --> 15:21.337
(chuckles) Hey, everything
in New Orleans is hot.

15:21.420 --> 15:23.213
Yeah, tell me about it.

15:25.090 --> 15:29.720
Oh, thank you. Ah.

15:29.803 --> 15:31.680
Mmm, much better.

15:31.764 --> 15:32.890
Those are called "Hurricanes."

15:32.973 --> 15:33.599
Mmm, they're delicious.

15:33.682 --> 15:36.185
Careful, they'll blow you over.

15:36.268 --> 15:38.187
{\an1}Man, this place
is jumping.

15:38.270 --> 15:39.271
Yeah, it's terrific.

15:39.355 --> 15:42.024
Oh, tell me about
that live radio broadcast thing

15:42.107 --> 15:43.525
you want to do
from the club.

15:43.609 --> 15:48.030
Later, man. We got all night.
Just lay back, let it soak in.

15:48.113 --> 15:50.157
Hey-hey, will you two excuse me
for a second?

15:50.240 --> 15:51.200
I think I see my date.

15:51.283 --> 15:53.369
Okay.

15:53.452 --> 15:56.080
{\an1}Well, you glad
you came?

15:56.163 --> 15:58.207
Mm, definitely.

16:00.918 --> 16:02.586
Mmm.

16:02.670 --> 16:04.380
(giggles)
(clears throat)

16:04.463 --> 16:06.632
CHUCKIE:
Mom, I have a question.

16:06.715 --> 16:08.342
Where did I come from?

16:08.425 --> 16:13.889
Well, sweetheart, your daddy
and I loved each other so much,

16:13.972 --> 16:16.725
and one night
there was so much love

16:16.809 --> 16:19.770
that it made
a whole other person,

16:19.853 --> 16:21.855
and that person was you.

16:21.939 --> 16:22.856
Thanks, Mom.

16:22.940 --> 16:25.401
I love you, Chuckie.

16:25.484 --> 16:28.112
I love you, too.

16:34.201 --> 16:38.414
Now let's finally meet the mom
we all wanted to have...

16:38.497 --> 16:39.623
Samantha Sanders.

16:47.214 --> 16:50.759
Thank you all so much.

16:50.843 --> 16:53.053
You know, when I first heard
about this show,

16:53.137 --> 16:54.263
I wanted the part so badly

16:54.346 --> 16:57.433
that when I went to pick up
the script,

16:57.516 --> 17:00.436
I took all the copies with me,
so nobody else could audition.

17:00.519 --> 17:02.563
(laughter)

17:02.646 --> 17:05.941
Seriously,
I really have to say

17:06.023 --> 17:07.276
that my years
with <i> The Hartley House...</i>

17:07.358 --> 17:08.277
{\an1}You know, Clare's
really been giving me

17:08.359 --> 17:10.279
{\an1}a hard time
about my mother.

17:10.362 --> 17:13.156
{\an3}Not your pig,
not your farm, my friend.

17:13.240 --> 17:15.284
You know, if there's
trouble in paradise,

17:15.367 --> 17:18.412
{\an1}maybe it's <i> his</i> fault,
you know?

17:18.494 --> 17:20.580
{\an3}Steve, you shouldn't get
in the middle of this.

17:20.664 --> 17:22.290
{\an3}You should know better
and so should Clare.

17:22.374 --> 17:25.252
{\an1}I know.
You're right.

17:25.335 --> 17:27.337
Thank you all very much.

17:34.386 --> 17:36.472
Samantha, that was
a wonderful speech!

17:36.555 --> 17:38.474
Thank you, Arnold.
I'm really proud of you, Mom.

17:38.557 --> 17:40.476
That's sweet, honey, thanks.

17:40.559 --> 17:41.602
Samantha, would you care
to dance?

17:41.685 --> 17:43.145
I would love to, but I can't.

17:43.228 --> 17:44.480
There is a major

17:44.563 --> 17:45.522
network powwow at the bar

17:45.606 --> 17:48.317
and they want to talk to me
about a new series.

17:48.400 --> 17:51.278
Well, then of course
you must go.

17:51.361 --> 17:54.198
We'll dance later.
Anyway, I knew you'd understand.

17:55.240 --> 17:56.533
{\an3}Kiss, kiss.

17:59.286 --> 18:00.829
Mom, don't you think

18:00.913 --> 18:03.457
{\an3}you ought to spend a little
more time with your date?

18:03.540 --> 18:06.335
Don't you think you ought to
pay a little more attention

18:06.418 --> 18:08.045
to your own business?

18:12.090 --> 18:14.676
{\an3}(sighs) She's totally
ignoring my Dad.

18:14.760 --> 18:16.011
{\an1}Clare...

18:16.095 --> 18:17.513
She's treating him like dirt.

18:17.596 --> 18:21.475
Clare, maybe you and your dad
need to grow up a little bit.

18:21.558 --> 18:22.476
Look around you.

18:22.559 --> 18:24.520
{\an1}This is
an industry-related function.

18:24.603 --> 18:26.355
{\an1}It's very important
to my mother.

18:26.438 --> 18:27.856
Everyone else in the room
seems to understand that.

18:27.940 --> 18:31.860
I can't believe <i> you</i> are talking
to <i> me</i> about growing up.

18:31.944 --> 18:33.362
And I can't believe

18:33.445 --> 18:35.364
you're turning this
into <i> my</i> relationship problem.

18:35.447 --> 18:38.867
Are we talking about our parents
or are we talking about us?

18:38.951 --> 18:41.453
You tell me.

18:44.039 --> 18:46.500
(sighs)

18:48.627 --> 18:50.587
(knocks)

18:52.089 --> 18:53.549
Do you mind if I come in?

18:53.632 --> 18:55.801
Yes, I do.

18:55.884 --> 19:00.055
Why do you pretend that you
don't know the real reason

19:00.138 --> 19:02.140
why I hate you so much?

19:02.224 --> 19:03.684
Because I don't.

19:03.767 --> 19:06.103
You know, Kel,
it's so insulting.

19:06.186 --> 19:08.564
I mean, do you think I would
forget something like that?

19:08.647 --> 19:09.773
We were both there.

19:09.857 --> 19:11.149
Both where, Valerie?

19:11.233 --> 19:12.276
Right here.

19:12.359 --> 19:13.569
It was two years ago,

19:13.652 --> 19:15.404
we had just gotten back
from Palm Springs.

19:15.487 --> 19:17.364
The night you ruined
my one chance with Brandon.

19:17.447 --> 19:20.409
Oh, and how did I do that?

19:20.492 --> 19:22.369
You really don't remember,
do you?

19:22.452 --> 19:25.080
I remember coming over here
to talk to Brandon

19:25.163 --> 19:26.290
and finding you all over him.

19:26.373 --> 19:28.584
No, Brandon was coming on to me.

19:28.667 --> 19:31.753
And since you claim
to have forgotten,

19:31.837 --> 19:33.922
{\an1}maybe I'll just refresh
your little memory, okay?

19:34.006 --> 19:37.426
Like I said before, we had just
gotten back from Palm Springs

19:37.509 --> 19:40.220
and Brandon and I
were on the couch.

19:40.304 --> 19:42.598
{\an1}Well, I'm glad
you made it home safely.

19:42.681 --> 19:44.391
{\an1}And I hope
you can forgive me.

19:44.474 --> 19:46.602
{\an3}We've got a little
too much history

19:46.685 --> 19:47.936
{\an3}between us
for me not to.

19:48.020 --> 19:51.607
{\an1}Yeah, we can't
let sex and drugs

19:51.690 --> 19:52.316
{\an1}ruin our
longtime friendship.

19:52.399 --> 19:56.612
Friends,
it's all we should be.

19:56.695 --> 19:57.529
Yeah.

20:01.491 --> 20:02.409
{\an3}(sighs)

20:02.492 --> 20:04.328
Well, back to reality.

20:04.411 --> 20:08.832
{\an3}Yep. See that "Sold" sign
on the front yard?

20:08.916 --> 20:11.335
{\an3}We got two weeks
to get out of here.

20:14.046 --> 20:15.672
{\an1}Well, a lot can happen
in two weeks.

20:36.443 --> 20:38.195
(doorbell chimes)

20:39.363 --> 20:40.697
I'd better get that.

20:46.286 --> 20:47.454
Brandon.
Hi.

20:47.537 --> 20:49.122
I need to talk to you.

20:49.206 --> 20:50.457
Can it wait till tomorrow?

20:50.540 --> 20:51.667
No, it can't.
Can I come in?

20:51.750 --> 20:53.961
{\an1}Don't say
I didn't warn you.

20:55.587 --> 20:57.005
Hey, Kel.

20:57.089 --> 20:57.673
Valerie.

20:57.756 --> 21:00.801
Well, if you two
ex-lovebirds

21:00.884 --> 21:04.554
need to be alone,
don't mind me.

21:09.768 --> 21:10.686
So, what is it?

21:10.769 --> 21:11.812
{\an1}Brandon...
Yeah?

21:11.895 --> 21:12.521
Mm!

21:12.604 --> 21:14.815
What are you doing?

21:14.898 --> 21:17.025
Trying to fix the biggest
mistake of my life.

21:17.109 --> 21:17.609
What're you talking about?

21:17.693 --> 21:19.903
{\an3}Brandon,
take me back.

21:19.987 --> 21:21.655
Please, give me one more chance.

21:21.738 --> 21:25.534
I can't. I can't,
I'm in love with Valerie.

21:25.617 --> 21:27.536
{\an1}What?
I'm in love with Valerie.

21:27.619 --> 21:29.371
I have been
ever since we were kids.

21:29.454 --> 21:31.832
Brandon,
you can't sleep with Valerie.

21:31.915 --> 21:34.710
If we ever meant anything
to each other, I'm begging you.

21:34.793 --> 21:36.545
Kel, come on.

21:36.628 --> 21:37.546
No, if anything ever happened
between the two of you,

21:37.629 --> 21:39.923
I don't know how I could live
with myself.

21:40.007 --> 21:41.883
Don't be crazy.
No, I <i> am</i> crazy.

21:41.967 --> 21:43.552
I swear I don't know
what I would do.

21:43.635 --> 21:46.221
Do you want that
on your conscience?

21:49.516 --> 21:52.436
No, no, I don't. Come on.

21:52.519 --> 21:54.479
{\an1}It's okay.

21:54.563 --> 21:57.816
Nothing's gonna happen between
me and Valerie, I promise.

22:00.152 --> 22:02.404
That's what you think happened?
That's why you hate me?

22:02.487 --> 22:03.572
Wouldn't you?

22:03.655 --> 22:05.782
Yes, if it were true,

22:05.866 --> 22:06.575
but that's not what happened.

22:06.658 --> 22:08.243
I didn't say
any of those things.

22:08.326 --> 22:10.954
Oh, come on, Kelly,
you stabbed me in the back.

22:11.038 --> 22:13.248
You couldn't have him,
so you ruined it for me

22:13.331 --> 22:13.749
just like you did Tracy.

22:13.832 --> 22:14.583
You are so wrong.

22:14.666 --> 22:16.460
You weren't even out there,
Valerie.

22:16.543 --> 22:17.711
I can only imagine.

22:17.794 --> 22:21.715
Would you like to know what
really happened on the porch?

22:21.798 --> 22:22.924
Only if you tell me the truth.

22:23.008 --> 22:24.217
{\an3}I promise.

22:24.301 --> 22:25.510
I may hate you,
but my word is still my word.

22:25.594 --> 22:28.096
Okay.

22:28.180 --> 22:29.264
I'm waiting.

22:31.308 --> 22:32.434
I wasn't there
for the first part,

22:32.517 --> 22:34.144
when you and Brandon
were on the couch.

22:34.227 --> 22:35.729
<i>But when I did come over,</i>

22:35.812 --> 22:38.231
<i>it was obvious that you two</i>
<i>had been doing something.</i>

22:38.315 --> 22:39.232
Hey, Kel.

22:39.316 --> 22:40.734
Valerie.

22:40.817 --> 22:42.402
(chuckles)

22:42.486 --> 22:45.113
Uh, well, if you two
ex-lovebirds need to be alone,

22:45.197 --> 22:47.240
don't mind me.

22:50.535 --> 22:53.413
What is it, Kel?

22:53.497 --> 22:55.957
I'm sorry for interrupting,
but I needed to talk to you.

22:56.041 --> 22:57.000
What about?

22:57.084 --> 22:58.794
I know I hurt you

22:58.877 --> 23:00.295
when I turned down
your proposal.

23:00.378 --> 23:00.921
Yes, you did.

23:01.004 --> 23:03.298
And I also understand why

23:03.381 --> 23:05.717
you don't want to go back
to the way things were.

23:07.677 --> 23:09.471
Why are you telling me this?

23:09.554 --> 23:12.390
Because, Brandon,
I still love you.

23:12.474 --> 23:13.225
(wry chuckle)

23:13.308 --> 23:15.185
Yeah, that's not
too painful, thanks.

23:15.268 --> 23:16.603
{\an3}Brandon, let
me finish.

23:16.686 --> 23:20.941
I want you to be happy,
even if it's not with me.

23:21.024 --> 23:23.819
{\an3}Now, I know I gave
you a hard time

23:23.902 --> 23:27.030
about Valerie because I thought
that she was using you.

23:27.114 --> 23:31.159
But if you do really care about
her, I won't stand in the way.

23:31.243 --> 23:32.953
Do you mean that?

23:33.036 --> 23:35.455
I wish we could go back
to the way things were,

23:35.539 --> 23:37.165
but I can't change my decision.

23:37.249 --> 23:40.836
{\an3}I want the best
for you, Brandon.

23:40.919 --> 23:44.339
And if that means
Valerie Malone,

23:44.423 --> 23:47.843
then I guess I'll have to learn
to live with it.

23:47.926 --> 23:50.595
Well, to tell you the truth,

23:50.679 --> 23:52.389
I'm not sure
what's going on right now.

23:52.472 --> 23:55.016
Really?

23:55.100 --> 23:55.684
{\an1}Yeah.

23:55.767 --> 23:59.521
Well, why don't you go home.

23:59.604 --> 24:00.856
I'll, uh, I'll call
you later, okay?

24:00.939 --> 24:03.692
Okay.

24:03.775 --> 24:05.360
Good night, Brandon.

24:05.443 --> 24:07.404
(whispers):
Yeah.

24:10.157 --> 24:13.034
So you're saying that you didn't
try to get between us?

24:13.118 --> 24:14.077
{\an3}That's what
I'm saying.

24:14.161 --> 24:14.703
All this time,
you've been blaming me

24:14.786 --> 24:16.538
for something I didn't do.

24:16.621 --> 24:18.999
Just tell me one thing.

24:19.082 --> 24:21.501
Why do you think I would
believe you for one second?

24:21.585 --> 24:23.879
Because I was there
and you weren't.

24:23.962 --> 24:25.672
You're lying.
I know you're lying.

24:27.674 --> 24:29.009
You know what?

24:29.092 --> 24:30.886
I don't care
if you believe me or not.

24:30.969 --> 24:32.554
But you can always ask Brandon.

24:32.637 --> 24:34.389
Well, maybe I will.

24:47.611 --> 24:49.321
(people laughing, chattering)

24:59.164 --> 24:59.915
You're still here?

24:59.998 --> 25:02.209
{\an1}Man, are you a glutton
for punishment.

25:02.292 --> 25:04.127
It's no better at the
homestead, my friend.

25:04.211 --> 25:07.088
You left those girls alone
by themselves?

25:07.172 --> 25:08.757
{\an3}Yep.
You have house insurance?

25:08.840 --> 25:09.758
I'm heavily insured,
but I got to tell you,

25:09.841 --> 25:12.427
I don't know
how to deal with this one.

25:12.510 --> 25:13.720
Well, just like
you told me, Brandon.

25:13.803 --> 25:14.930
Stay out of the middle of it.

25:15.013 --> 25:16.932
I can't stay out
of the middle, Steve.

25:17.015 --> 25:18.934
I am the middle;
that's the problem.

25:19.017 --> 25:20.143
(Clare sighs)

25:20.227 --> 25:21.603
Looks like the queen bee's

25:21.686 --> 25:22.646
entertaining her drones.

25:22.729 --> 25:25.941
{\an1}Clare, give me a break
with that already, will you?

25:26.024 --> 25:27.567
Long as I'm here,
might as well have a drink.

25:27.651 --> 25:28.777
You know, I think
I'm gonna go home.

25:28.860 --> 25:30.403
Do you want me
to give you guys a ride?

25:30.487 --> 25:32.614
Yeah.
No, that's okay.

25:34.241 --> 25:35.158
Wait, wait, wait.

25:35.242 --> 25:37.786
We have reports of movement.

25:40.205 --> 25:41.122
(gasps)

25:41.206 --> 25:42.958
{\an1}You are such a dear
for waiting.

25:43.041 --> 25:45.126
Don't even think about it.

25:45.210 --> 25:46.086
Uh, shall I get your coat?

25:46.169 --> 25:48.129
Oh, Antonio's
taking care of that.

25:48.213 --> 25:49.965
We're going on to another party.

25:50.048 --> 25:53.635
Didn't I tell you?

25:53.718 --> 25:54.386
Actually, you didn't.

25:55.804 --> 25:57.973
Why don't, uh,
why don't you

25:58.056 --> 25:59.099
go on without me?

25:59.182 --> 26:00.350
I-I have an early seminar.

26:00.433 --> 26:01.476
Didn't I tell you?

26:01.559 --> 26:02.978
You're angry with me.

26:03.061 --> 26:04.145
Yes, I am.

26:04.229 --> 26:05.146
Why are you blowing this

26:05.230 --> 26:06.439
all out of proportion?

26:06.523 --> 26:08.483
{\an1}Are you trying
to pick a fight with me?

26:08.566 --> 26:09.609
On the contrary.

26:09.693 --> 26:11.194
I've been trying not to
all evening.

26:13.238 --> 26:14.823
I knew this would happen.

26:14.906 --> 26:15.991
We come from

26:16.074 --> 26:17.325
two different worlds.

26:17.409 --> 26:19.327
{\an1}You just don't understand
the business.

26:19.411 --> 26:21.997
Samantha, I may not
understand your world,

26:22.080 --> 26:24.499
but I do understand
common courtesy.

26:24.582 --> 26:25.709
Maybe we should face the facts.

26:25.792 --> 26:27.877
The fact is that you are
embarrassing me.

26:29.754 --> 26:31.256
And I won't stand for it.

26:33.925 --> 26:35.343
Your mother just dumped my dad.
Do something.

26:35.427 --> 26:36.845
Do what?

26:36.928 --> 26:39.681
Mom...

26:39.764 --> 26:40.974
Good night, Steve.

26:41.057 --> 26:42.183
I'll call you tomorrow.

26:42.267 --> 26:43.184
Where you going now?

26:43.268 --> 26:44.728
I'm going to the party,

26:44.811 --> 26:46.563
and then I'm going
back to New York.

26:49.899 --> 26:50.859
Clare, where're you going?

26:50.942 --> 26:53.194
Gonna go drive my Dad home.

26:53.278 --> 26:55.238
I don't want him
to be alone right now.

26:58.908 --> 27:01.286
Well, so much for the theory
of non-intervention.

27:03.121 --> 27:05.332
(knocking)

27:05.415 --> 27:07.042
Leave me alone, Kelly.

27:07.125 --> 27:08.043
I'm sleeping.

27:08.126 --> 27:10.253
With the light on?

27:10.337 --> 27:12.213
What is this, round two?

27:12.297 --> 27:14.299
I need to talk to you.

27:16.301 --> 27:17.385
{\an3}(sighs)

27:17.469 --> 27:18.845
{\an3}Do I have
a choice?

27:18.928 --> 27:21.222
Something's still bothering me
about that night.

27:21.306 --> 27:22.724
And what could that be?

27:22.807 --> 27:26.019
Brandon said he would call me,
and he never did.

27:26.102 --> 27:28.897
So?

27:28.980 --> 27:31.191
So, what happened between
the two of you after I left?

27:31.274 --> 27:32.400
What do you think?

27:32.484 --> 27:34.235
I can only imagine.

27:34.319 --> 27:36.237
(chuckles):
Oh, great.

27:36.321 --> 27:37.238
Knock yourself out.

27:37.322 --> 27:38.740
I can't wait to hear this one.

27:38.823 --> 27:42.577
Well, I've played it over in
my mind about a million times.

27:42.660 --> 27:46.331
<i>He came in from the porch,</i>
<i>and you were waiting.</i>

27:46.414 --> 27:48.083
{\an3}So, you all done?
Yep.

27:48.166 --> 27:50.752
Wonder how long it's gonna
take her to get to Dylan's.

27:50.835 --> 27:52.295
Figure that's where she's going?

27:52.379 --> 27:53.296
{\an3}No doubt.

27:53.380 --> 27:54.464
How that blonde scored

27:54.547 --> 27:56.341
the two hottest guys
in Beverly Hills is beyond me.

27:58.426 --> 28:00.303
"Oh, Dylan console me,
take me around the world."

28:02.305 --> 28:03.640
Are you jealous?

28:03.723 --> 28:04.766
No.

28:04.849 --> 28:06.893
She can do whatever she wants.

28:06.976 --> 28:08.436
And after the way

28:08.520 --> 28:09.104
she treated me,
she's got no right

28:09.187 --> 28:11.231
to tell me who I can be with.

28:11.314 --> 28:11.898
And who is that?

28:11.981 --> 28:15.777
Like you don't know.

28:15.860 --> 28:16.861
What are you
waiting for?

28:26.204 --> 28:26.913
(chuckles)

28:26.996 --> 28:28.915
Yeah, that's right.

28:28.998 --> 28:30.458
That's exactly what happened.

28:30.542 --> 28:32.460
{\an3}You're sure?
Word for word.

28:32.544 --> 28:34.462
You must have been
listening at the door.

28:34.546 --> 28:36.756
So then you two just
rode off into the sunset,

28:36.840 --> 28:37.966
had a hot night.

28:38.049 --> 28:38.967
The hottest.

28:39.050 --> 28:40.802
Then why did you tell me

28:40.885 --> 28:42.470
I ruined your big chance
with Brandon?

28:42.554 --> 28:45.265
Okay, Kelly,
good night, all right?

28:45.348 --> 28:46.641
{\an1}Game's over.
No.

28:46.724 --> 28:48.476
I want to know
what it is that I ruined

28:48.560 --> 28:49.310
if you two spent
that night together.

28:49.394 --> 28:51.146
Otherwise,
it was you who blew it.

28:51.229 --> 28:52.147
Come on, Kelly.

28:52.230 --> 28:53.231
You know as well as I do

28:53.314 --> 28:54.983
that nothing ever happened
between me and Brandon.

28:55.066 --> 28:59.279
{\an3}So stop
rubbing it in.

28:59.362 --> 29:02.365
Honestly?

29:02.449 --> 29:03.491
I didn't know that.

29:03.575 --> 29:04.534
But thank you.

29:04.617 --> 29:06.035
You know, I don't
care what you said

29:06.119 --> 29:08.788
or didn't say on the porch,
I know it was your fault.

29:08.872 --> 29:10.331
{\an3}I mean, after
you left,

29:10.415 --> 29:13.001
I tried everything to get
Brandon to sleep with me.

29:13.084 --> 29:14.335
And he wouldn't.

29:14.419 --> 29:16.004
I mean, he said it was because
we were like brother and sister,

29:16.087 --> 29:18.506
but I know it was you.

29:18.590 --> 29:19.591
I mean, he was

29:19.674 --> 29:21.885
the love of my life,
and you screwed it up for me.

29:21.968 --> 29:25.138
See, that's your problem,
Valerie.

29:25.221 --> 29:27.348
First, Tom was
the love of your life,

29:27.432 --> 29:29.517
{\an1}then Colin was the love of
your life, now it's Brandon.

29:29.601 --> 29:31.311
You do so much lying,
you don't even know

29:31.394 --> 29:33.021
what's it's like
to tell the truth anymore.

29:33.104 --> 29:36.691
No, you just can't deal with
how close Brandon and I are.

29:36.774 --> 29:37.984
No, I think you have that
a little backwards.

29:38.067 --> 29:39.527
It's you who can't deal with
me and Brandon.

29:39.611 --> 29:41.654
Then why are you
trying to take away

29:41.738 --> 29:43.031
the only family I have left?

29:43.114 --> 29:46.576
First, he's your lover
and then he's your family.

29:46.659 --> 29:48.578
I think you have that
confused there.

29:48.661 --> 29:49.996
Those two things
don't go together.

29:53.291 --> 29:54.876
Get out.

29:55.919 --> 29:58.171
With pleasure.

30:00.965 --> 30:02.884
(door slams)

30:02.967 --> 30:05.929
(country music playing)

30:06.012 --> 30:07.722
{\an1}(sighs)

30:07.805 --> 30:09.349
{\an1}Aha.

30:09.432 --> 30:11.351
{\an1}Your carriage awaits,
my dear.

30:11.434 --> 30:12.560
Oh.

30:12.644 --> 30:13.561
I love you.

30:13.645 --> 30:14.562
{\an1}(chuckles)

30:14.646 --> 30:16.356
And I love New Orleans.

30:16.439 --> 30:18.566
Yeah, me, too.

30:18.650 --> 30:20.235
The city is so...

30:20.318 --> 30:21.236
What?

30:21.319 --> 30:22.237
What, intoxicating?

30:22.320 --> 30:23.238
(laughs)

30:23.321 --> 30:24.739
Yeah, that, too.

30:24.822 --> 30:28.701
{\an3}But, uh, did you notice
the houses on our way here?

30:28.785 --> 30:29.953
Yeah. What about them?

30:30.036 --> 30:34.249
Well, the owners, they
keep everything inside.

30:34.332 --> 30:36.584
You know, from the outside,
the houses look really plain,

30:36.668 --> 30:39.671
and then on the inside, there's
this whole secret life going on.

30:41.673 --> 30:43.091
Are you trying to get
philosophical on me?

30:43.174 --> 30:47.011
No, but I'm getting hot on you.

30:47.095 --> 30:48.721
(both laugh)

30:48.805 --> 30:51.432
It still stays hot out here,
even after it rains.

30:51.516 --> 30:52.433
{\an1}(sighs):
Yeah.

30:52.517 --> 30:54.269
Well, Martin Burns was right,

30:54.352 --> 30:56.729
everything is hot
in the Big Easy.

30:56.813 --> 30:57.605
Mm-hmm.

30:57.689 --> 30:58.982
Especially you.

30:59.065 --> 31:00.608
Mmm.

31:10.159 --> 31:13.788
(door creaks softly)

31:13.871 --> 31:15.290
{\an3}KELLY:
Hey.

31:15.373 --> 31:16.082
{\an1}Hey.

31:16.165 --> 31:20.044
What are you doing up?

31:20.128 --> 31:21.754
{\an3}Mmm...

31:21.838 --> 31:23.631
{\an3}I was waiting
for you.

31:23.715 --> 31:24.799
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

31:24.882 --> 31:25.883
Are you feeling better?

31:25.967 --> 31:27.760
Much, thank you.

31:27.844 --> 31:29.262
Come here.

31:29.345 --> 31:31.139
(moans softly)

31:31.222 --> 31:32.974
What was that for?

31:33.057 --> 31:34.642
For never sleeping
with Valerie.

31:34.726 --> 31:36.728
Mmm.
Mmm.

31:37.729 --> 31:40.648
(both moan softly)

31:47.905 --> 31:49.115
{\an3}Clare, I'm
kind of bummed

31:49.198 --> 31:50.158
{\an3}it didn't work out well
between our parents tonight.

31:50.241 --> 31:52.660
Your dad's man enough
to deal with it.

31:52.744 --> 31:53.661
He'll be all right.

31:53.745 --> 31:55.663
(grunts softly)

31:55.747 --> 32:00.501
Just dismiss it,
just like she dismissed him?

32:00.585 --> 32:02.128
Clare...

32:02.211 --> 32:04.464
He's devastated, Steve.

32:04.547 --> 32:06.174
She ripped his heart out
tonight.

32:06.257 --> 32:07.967
And you're overdramatizing.

32:08.051 --> 32:09.677
{\an3}And why are
you mad at me?

32:09.761 --> 32:10.470
I didn't do anything.

32:10.553 --> 32:12.347
(sighs):
Right.

32:12.430 --> 32:13.681
That's what important.

32:13.765 --> 32:14.682
That you sleep well,

32:14.766 --> 32:16.976
secure in the knowledge
that you're blameless.

32:17.060 --> 32:17.977
{\an3}Oh, please.

32:18.061 --> 32:19.187
I'm sleeping
on the couch.

32:19.270 --> 32:19.771
{\an3}No, you know what, why don't
you sleep in your bed,

32:19.854 --> 32:21.397
I'll sleep on the couch.

32:25.443 --> 32:27.445
(sighs)

32:40.792 --> 32:42.794
(both breathing heavily)

32:44.712 --> 32:47.340
(grunts)

32:47.423 --> 32:49.425
You're so beautiful.

32:51.427 --> 32:52.220
{\an3}I love you
so much.

32:52.303 --> 32:54.305
(moans softly)

33:02.814 --> 33:04.232
Wait, David.

33:04.315 --> 33:06.192
What?

33:06.275 --> 33:07.318
(sighs)

33:10.113 --> 33:11.531
(sighs)

33:11.614 --> 33:13.074
(sighs)

33:13.157 --> 33:15.076
Great.

33:15.159 --> 33:16.744
You can't go through with it.

33:16.828 --> 33:18.121
I'm sorry.

33:18.204 --> 33:20.915
(sighing):
Donna.

33:20.998 --> 33:22.250
I thought I could.

33:22.333 --> 33:24.085
I really did.

33:24.168 --> 33:26.254
What's wrong?

33:31.300 --> 33:32.635
I'm scared.

33:34.679 --> 33:37.140
It's just that
we've waited so long.

33:37.223 --> 33:39.934
I don't know
what's right anymore.

33:40.017 --> 33:41.936
I thought you wanted to.

33:42.019 --> 33:43.062
{\an3}I did.

33:43.146 --> 33:44.188
I do. I...

33:44.272 --> 33:46.399
Ohh...

33:46.482 --> 33:47.191
I do.

33:50.194 --> 33:50.528
Just not now.

33:50.611 --> 33:53.156
Not this way.

33:53.239 --> 33:55.158
(sighs)

33:55.241 --> 33:57.160
It's okay. It's...

33:57.243 --> 33:59.162
(sighs) It's fine.

33:59.245 --> 34:03.124
Oh, no, it isn't.

34:03.207 --> 34:05.626
Uh... I-It's fine. It's fine.

34:07.545 --> 34:08.963
(sighs)

34:09.047 --> 34:13.801
I just, I just have
to be more patient.

34:13.885 --> 34:15.844
I mean, I'm sure our wedding
night'll be too soon,

34:15.928 --> 34:18.097
but you know, maybe after
a couple years of marriage...

34:18.181 --> 34:20.349
{\an1}(sighing)

34:22.393 --> 34:24.937
I'm sorry.

34:26.230 --> 34:27.273
I know it's not funny.

34:27.356 --> 34:32.195
Believe me, I know.

34:32.277 --> 34:34.280
And I'm sorry.

34:34.362 --> 34:35.364
I really thought that I could.

34:36.407 --> 34:38.826
(sighs)

34:40.077 --> 34:42.163
I just, uh...
I don't know what else

34:42.246 --> 34:43.206
I have to prove
to you, you know?

34:43.289 --> 34:45.500
We love each other.

34:45.583 --> 34:46.501
{\an1}We're in a committed
relationship.

34:46.583 --> 34:51.505
We're in the most
romantic city in America.

34:51.589 --> 34:52.380
And I've got condoms
in the drawer.

34:55.259 --> 34:58.304
Just tell me what I need to do.

34:58.387 --> 35:00.348
Just tell me when.

35:03.935 --> 35:05.895
I wish I knew the answer.

35:31.838 --> 35:33.714
Oh, my God! David!

35:33.798 --> 35:36.717
Mmm... Good morning.

35:36.801 --> 35:38.261
Good morning?
Look at the time!

35:38.344 --> 35:39.679
Why didn't the alarm go off?

35:39.762 --> 35:41.681
What? I set it for 6:00.

35:41.764 --> 35:43.391
Well, it's 8:00.

35:43.474 --> 35:46.519
I must've set it for p.m.
instead of a.m.

35:46.602 --> 35:47.728
My class! My presentation!

35:47.812 --> 35:49.397
We can't miss the plane.
Are we gonna miss the plane?

35:49.480 --> 35:50.898
I don't know.
I don't know, Donna.

35:50.982 --> 35:51.691
Let's see if we can catch it.

35:51.774 --> 35:52.692
Oh, I'm dead.

35:52.775 --> 35:55.027
I am so dead.
All right.

35:55.111 --> 35:59.198
(surf crashing)

35:59.282 --> 36:00.533
Ah, it's 6:00 in the morning.

36:00.616 --> 36:01.617
You sleep at all?

36:01.993 --> 36:02.869
No.

36:02.952 --> 36:06.122
Me either.

36:06.205 --> 36:08.374
You know, Clare,
we're not responsible

36:08.457 --> 36:11.043
for what our parents do...
or what they don't do.

36:11.127 --> 36:13.921
I know.

36:14.005 --> 36:15.756
You're right.

36:15.840 --> 36:17.383
It's just pretty
convenient, you know,

36:17.466 --> 36:18.509
considering my dad
didn't do anything.

36:18.593 --> 36:21.596
Do you hear me talking to you?
That's not the point.

36:21.679 --> 36:24.932
Yeah, that <i> is</i> the point.
(sighs)

36:25.016 --> 36:25.933
{\an1}Okay.

36:26.017 --> 36:27.393
Okay, she dumped him. She was...

36:27.476 --> 36:30.229
she was rude and selfish
and self-absorbed

36:30.313 --> 36:31.772
and all those things.

36:31.856 --> 36:32.940
She <i> was.</i> You're right.

36:33.024 --> 36:34.775
{\an1}You win.

36:34.859 --> 36:36.819
So why did you spend
the whole night defending her?

36:36.903 --> 36:38.905
Because she's my mother, Clare.

36:45.077 --> 36:46.412
(sighs)

36:46.495 --> 36:48.331
She really hurt him.

36:48.414 --> 36:50.291
{\an1}Well, she
can do that.

36:50.374 --> 36:52.001
No one knows that
better than <i> me.</i>

36:52.084 --> 36:55.421
(sighs)

36:55.504 --> 36:58.007
Look, I am sorry, okay.

36:58.090 --> 36:59.008
I'm sorry that you have

36:59.091 --> 37:00.718
a screwed-up relationship
with your parents.

37:02.678 --> 37:05.306
My dad is all I've got.

37:05.389 --> 37:06.474
I'm not gonna let
anyone hurt him,

37:06.557 --> 37:07.475
I don't care

37:07.558 --> 37:08.893
who it is, okay?

37:08.976 --> 37:10.978
Do you understand
that, Steve? Do you?

37:11.062 --> 37:13.064
Yeah, all too clearly.

37:15.066 --> 37:16.359
What?

37:16.442 --> 37:18.444
Well, you're making
me think, Clare,

37:18.527 --> 37:20.446
if your father's all you've got,

37:20.529 --> 37:23.491
then where does that
leave me, huh?

37:27.453 --> 37:29.121
Morning. Feeling better?

37:29.205 --> 37:30.498
{\an3}Yeah.

37:30.581 --> 37:31.499
Isn't it amazing?

37:31.582 --> 37:33.459
Well, I knew confession
was good for the soul.

37:33.542 --> 37:36.671
I didn't know
it was good for the flu.

37:36.754 --> 37:38.339
{\an3}Me neither.

37:38.422 --> 37:41.384
{\an1}Kelly told me
you guys talked last night.

37:41.467 --> 37:42.593
That's good.

37:44.553 --> 37:47.181
{\an3}Yeah, I was kind of worried
that I went too far.

37:47.264 --> 37:48.516
I really lost my temper.

37:48.599 --> 37:51.519
Well, what did you tell her?

37:51.602 --> 37:53.312
Brandon, relax.

37:53.396 --> 37:55.398
I told her nothing ever
happened between us.

37:55.481 --> 37:57.108
That's the truth, isn't it?

37:57.191 --> 37:58.484
Yes, that <i> is</i> the truth.

37:58.567 --> 38:01.904
You want some coffee?

38:01.988 --> 38:05.324
{\an3}No, actually, I, I
gotta get to the club.

38:07.785 --> 38:09.412
Uh, is Kelly still asleep?

38:09.495 --> 38:12.248
Yeah.

38:12.331 --> 38:13.374
You know, Brandon,

38:13.457 --> 38:16.252
{\an3}Kelly and I have had
our ups and downs, but...

38:16.335 --> 38:18.045
{\an3}I think I'm really going
to miss her next year.

38:18.129 --> 38:20.339
What do you mean?

38:20.423 --> 38:22.216
Well, next year. In New York.

38:22.299 --> 38:23.384
You're going to New York?

38:23.467 --> 38:25.678
No, not me, Kelly is.

38:27.930 --> 38:30.558
She applied to grad
school at Columbia.

38:30.641 --> 38:31.767
Didn't you know?

38:36.313 --> 38:37.481
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I knew that.

38:37.565 --> 38:40.943
I just, uh... it just slipped
my mind, that's all.

38:42.028 --> 38:44.363
Right, yeah. Uh...

38:44.447 --> 38:45.531
Well, see ya.

38:47.158 --> 38:48.576
Yeah.

38:57.626 --> 38:59.587
{\an3}Donna, hey.

38:59.670 --> 39:00.588
Where were you?

39:00.671 --> 39:02.423
{\an1}I was in New Orleans
with David.

39:02.506 --> 39:04.592
Ooh. Well, at least
you had fun, right?

39:04.675 --> 39:06.761
Yeah, I wish.

39:06.844 --> 39:08.721
Well, well, Miss Martin.

39:08.804 --> 39:10.723
{\an3}Professor Langely,
I am so sorry.

39:10.806 --> 39:12.099
Well, as far as I'm concerned,

39:12.183 --> 39:13.893
you've outdone yourself.

39:13.976 --> 39:14.977
I mean you've surpassed

39:15.061 --> 39:16.771
even your own usual
meager contribution.

39:16.854 --> 39:18.606
{\an1}Not only did you not
do the assignment,

39:18.689 --> 39:20.441
{\an1}you didn't have
the courtesy to show up?

39:20.524 --> 39:21.776
{\an3}But I-I did do it.
It's right here.

39:21.859 --> 39:22.651
{\an1}Oh, and now
you're gonna tell me

39:22.735 --> 39:24.945
{\an1}the tragic reason
behind your inability

39:25.029 --> 39:25.613
to show me and
your classmates

39:25.696 --> 39:28.407
{\an1}the teeniest
shred of courtesy,

39:28.491 --> 39:29.492
{\an1}not to mention
professional behavior.

39:29.575 --> 39:31.619
It was an accident.

39:31.702 --> 39:32.620
What was an accident?

39:32.703 --> 39:35.581
See... I-I missed my
flight this morning,

39:35.664 --> 39:36.624
and I couldn't get

39:36.707 --> 39:38.793
{\an3}another one until...
Never mind.

39:38.876 --> 39:39.960
I don't want to hear about it.

39:40.044 --> 39:42.463
{\an3}Professor Langely, I am
ready to present my project

39:42.546 --> 39:43.506
any time you want me to.

39:43.589 --> 39:45.132
I'm afraid that's not possible.

39:45.216 --> 39:46.133
But it's all done.

39:46.217 --> 39:46.842
I worked for weeks on this.

39:46.926 --> 39:48.928
{\an1}And that's
no concern to me now.

39:49.011 --> 39:49.804
The real world, Miss Martin,

39:49.887 --> 39:52.723
has deadlines,
and you've blown yours.

39:54.433 --> 39:56.477
Wait. I can't fail this class.

39:56.560 --> 39:57.478
I need it to graduate.

39:57.561 --> 39:58.604
{\an3}Then I suggest you
do well on your final.

39:58.687 --> 40:00.689
That's you last chance.

40:08.739 --> 40:09.657
NAT:
<i>Hey, Val.</i>

40:09.740 --> 40:11.534
This fellow's here
to see you.

40:11.617 --> 40:12.535
Well, you found me.

40:12.618 --> 40:13.619
(chuckling)

40:13.702 --> 40:14.537
I'm glad
you're feeling better.

40:14.620 --> 40:17.665
Thanks, Nat.
See you.

40:17.748 --> 40:20.376
{\an1}I hope you don't mind me
dropping by like this,

40:20.459 --> 40:21.335
but I phoned your home,

40:21.418 --> 40:23.003
{\an1}and they told me that
you would be <i> here,</i>

40:23.087 --> 40:23.671
so I took a chance.

40:23.754 --> 40:26.048
I'm Derek Driscoll.

40:26.132 --> 40:27.967
Uh, do I know you?

40:28.050 --> 40:29.677
From Bill Taylor Investments.

40:29.760 --> 40:31.679
You called us about some capital
investment opportunities.

40:31.762 --> 40:35.057
No, actually,
I called Bill.

40:35.141 --> 40:36.851
And he's in the Far East,

40:36.934 --> 40:37.852
Kuala Lumpur.

40:37.935 --> 40:39.520
So, will I do for now?

40:39.603 --> 40:41.438
You'll do.

40:41.522 --> 40:43.190
Uh, do you want
to take a seat?

40:43.274 --> 40:44.400
Yes. Thank you.

40:44.483 --> 40:45.693
When I told Bill that

40:45.776 --> 40:47.862
I was coming to Los Angeles,

40:47.945 --> 40:48.696
he asked me to look
you up personally.

40:48.779 --> 40:50.990
Are you busy right now?

40:51.073 --> 40:52.533
No, your timing's perfect.

40:52.616 --> 40:53.868
We try.

40:53.951 --> 40:57.204
This is, uh, quite a
place you have here.

40:57.288 --> 40:58.873
Are you the manager?

40:58.956 --> 41:00.875
No, I own it.

41:00.958 --> 41:04.336
I have other investors,
but basically it's mine.

41:04.420 --> 41:05.754
Great.

41:05.838 --> 41:09.425
Valerie, I hope you
don't mind me asking this,

41:09.508 --> 41:11.677
but... how did you come
to select our little operation?

41:11.760 --> 41:15.681
{\an3}Well, Bill's daughter, Kelly,
is one of my good friends.

41:15.764 --> 41:16.682
{\an1}Oh.

41:16.765 --> 41:20.561
{\an1}So you must know
Bill pretty well, then?

41:20.644 --> 41:24.440
Actually, we've never met,
but Kelly talks a lot about him,

41:24.523 --> 41:27.026
and I'm anxious about getting
to know him personally.

41:27.109 --> 41:28.027
{\an1}Are you?

41:28.110 --> 41:30.905
Bill usually
likes me to handle point

41:30.988 --> 41:32.573
on the business end of things.

41:32.656 --> 41:34.617
I don't know how much
you know about how

41:34.700 --> 41:35.409
our company works.

41:35.492 --> 41:37.870
Well, I don't, but
you can tell me.

41:37.953 --> 41:40.247
{\an1}Basically,
we pool money

41:40.331 --> 41:41.582
{\an1}from an elite
group of investors,

41:41.665 --> 41:46.128
use it to finance various
companies and projects overseas.

41:46.212 --> 41:48.714
We have found the foreign market
to be remarkably profitable.

41:48.797 --> 41:51.592
{\an1}Of course, there
are some risks, but,

41:51.675 --> 41:53.552
without risk,
there can be no reward.

41:53.636 --> 41:57.932
Well, I've never been one
to shy away from risk.

41:58.015 --> 41:58.641
When do you think
I can meet Bill?

41:58.724 --> 42:00.643
Very soon.

42:00.726 --> 42:01.727
Great.

42:01.810 --> 42:03.854
Can't wait.

42:08.859 --> 42:12.071
Hey. How's the flu?

42:12.154 --> 42:12.947
Oh, a lot better, but I thought

42:13.030 --> 42:15.699
I should take
one more day, you know.

42:15.783 --> 42:16.951
Sure you can
afford that?

42:17.034 --> 42:19.161
{\an3}I hear Columbia's pretty
tough on attendance.

42:19.245 --> 42:20.538
What?

42:20.621 --> 42:20.955
Columbia University.

42:21.038 --> 42:23.082
New York City.

42:23.165 --> 42:24.750
{\an3}That's where you're going
to graduate school, isn't it?

42:24.833 --> 42:27.127
What are you talking
about, Brandon?

42:27.211 --> 42:27.795
Didn't you apply there?

42:27.878 --> 42:30.589
Yes.

42:30.673 --> 42:31.757
Did you get accepted?

42:31.840 --> 42:32.466
Yes.

42:32.549 --> 42:34.969
So when were you gonna tell me?

42:35.052 --> 42:36.762
There's not really
a lot to tell.

42:36.845 --> 42:38.973
I applied, they accepted me.

42:39.056 --> 42:42.101
{\an1}This was all long
before you and Tracy

42:42.184 --> 42:43.978
ever broke up.

42:44.061 --> 42:46.981
I-I'm not going to New York now.

42:47.064 --> 42:49.108
I'm not going anywhere.

42:51.902 --> 42:53.320
Okay.

42:53.404 --> 42:55.698
How did you know
about this anyway?

42:59.410 --> 43:00.327
Valerie told me,

43:00.411 --> 43:00.828
{\an3}and, uh...
(clearing throat)

43:00.911 --> 43:02.955
I believed her.

43:03.038 --> 43:05.040
She must have read it
in my journal.

43:06.917 --> 43:07.793
How much more proof
do you need, Brandon?

43:07.876 --> 43:10.129
Proof about what?

43:10.212 --> 43:11.839
I have tried every thing I know
to make it work with Valerie,

43:11.922 --> 43:12.756
and it's not working.

43:12.840 --> 43:15.843
So what do you want
me to do about it?

43:15.926 --> 43:16.844
I don't know,

43:16.927 --> 43:21.557
{\an1}but both of us cannot
live in this house.

43:21.640 --> 43:24.351
Kel, come o... Come on.

43:24.435 --> 43:25.352
She's like family to me.

43:25.436 --> 43:26.979
Don't make me do this.

43:29.940 --> 43:32.234
(sighs)
