You look like one of those
non-ethnic burglars

00:38.834 --> 00:40.250
in the home alarm
commercials.

00:40.250 --> 00:42.417
Merely a cunning
disguise, Steve.

00:42.417 --> 00:45.291
I'm going undercover
at the Occupy rally today.

00:45.291 --> 00:47.667
Didn't that Occupy
movement blow over?

00:47.667 --> 00:49.291
But it didn't
blow out.

00:49.291 --> 00:51.625
It's the anniversary rally
celebrating the day

00:51.625 --> 00:53.375
they didn't get
kicked out of that park.

00:53.375 --> 00:56.250
CIA's gotten word that
these anti-Americans

00:56.250 --> 00:57.709
are using this
rally as a cover

00:57.709 --> 00:59.583
to plan a major
terrorist attack.

00:59.583 --> 01:01.750
Come on, Dad, they
aren't anti-American,

01:01.750 --> 01:03.208
they're anti-capitalist.

01:03.208 --> 01:05.750
And, you know, I think
they make a lot of good points

01:05.750 --> 01:07.792
about our culture's
veneration of the super rich.

01:08.834 --> 01:10.041
God, you're
annoying.

01:10.041 --> 01:11.625
Everything you
say is annoying.

01:11.625 --> 01:13.083
You want some
coffee, Stan?

01:13.083 --> 01:15.583
I just got a new grind
from Delayna's Coffee.

01:15.583 --> 01:17.792
Mom, that company is the worst.

01:17.792 --> 01:19.417
The CEO lives in a castle

01:19.417 --> 01:22.667
and doesn't even pay
his employees a living wage.

01:22.667 --> 01:24.208
God, you're annoying.

01:24.208 --> 01:25.959
Everything you
say is annoying.

01:25.959 --> 01:27.458
You know what?
I give up.

01:27.458 --> 01:29.250
How can you expect
to infiltrate a group of people

01:29.250 --> 01:31.375
when you won't even open
your mind to their beliefs?

01:31.375 --> 01:33.667
Hayley, I've seen
Reality Bites, all right?

01:33.667 --> 01:36.208
I think I get the agenda
of this generation.

01:36.208 --> 01:39.333
Oh, and it shows
from your kick-ass disguise.

01:39.333 --> 01:40.750
Hey, you know the only
thing you're missing

01:40.750 --> 01:42.500
are the mirrored shades.

01:42.500 --> 01:44.208
Mirrored shades?
Really?

01:44.208 --> 01:45.792
Oh, definitely.

01:45.792 --> 01:47.792
All the groovy protesters
wear them.

01:47.792 --> 01:50.208
If I leave now,
I can probably hit
that Sunglass Hut

01:50.208 --> 01:53.000
at the mall before it
goes out of business.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.667
- Klaus!
- Jawohl?

01:54.667 --> 01:56.625
Get ready to flip me my
car keys with your tail,

01:56.625 --> 01:58.000
like you do
every morning.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
I've been ready
for three hours.

02:01.417 --> 02:03.041
Stan, you forgot
your coffee.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.542
And your keys.

02:08.208 --> 02:10.250
Was that Stan
coming back for his keys?

02:10.250 --> 02:13.291
Yes, but he let a coyote
in the house when he did.

02:16.500 --> 02:18.834
Open the back
door so it has a way out.

02:22.041 --> 02:24.375
You do realize this
is about climate change.

02:32.333 --> 02:34.959
God, it's worse than I thought.

02:36.041 --> 02:38.250
Hey, man, you want
to go with us?

02:38.250 --> 02:40.250
We're gonna go intimidate
that Verizon store

02:40.250 --> 02:41.709
into letting us
use their bathroom.

02:41.709 --> 02:43.166
Right on.

02:43.166 --> 02:45.667
Wait, don't I recognize
you three from somewhere?

02:46.500 --> 02:47.834
I know.

02:47.834 --> 02:49.333
You used to be
multicultural members

02:49.333 --> 02:50.709
of the Burger King Kids' Club.

02:50.709 --> 02:53.834
A girl, a black kid
and a paraplegic.

02:53.834 --> 02:55.709
All friends, somehow.

02:55.709 --> 02:57.166
Yeah, that's us.

02:57.166 --> 02:59.458
But we took off when
they changed their fries.

02:59.458 --> 03:00.792
Well, let's do it, man.

03:00.792 --> 03:01.875
I'm one of you.

03:01.875 --> 03:03.458
Just looking to agitate.

03:05.291 --> 03:06.750
Okay, you're in.

03:06.750 --> 03:08.750
But first,
douse your bandana

03:08.750 --> 03:10.750
in this tear gas
neutralizer.

03:14.667 --> 03:16.625
Huh. Smells a little like ether.

03:21.959 --> 03:24.083
Where...
where am I?

03:24.083 --> 03:25.333
A foxhole...

03:25.333 --> 03:26.583
on the front line

03:26.583 --> 03:28.709
in the war
for class equality.

03:28.709 --> 03:29.959
Why are you doing this?

03:29.959 --> 03:31.291
I thought we were coolio.

03:31.291 --> 03:33.542
Yeah, we know you
work for the CIA.

03:33.542 --> 03:36.375
Only a narc would wear
those mirrored shades.

03:36.375 --> 03:38.667
But my daughter told me they
would make me look really cool

03:38.667 --> 03:40.959
and oh, I get it,
she set me up, I'm stupid.

03:40.959 --> 03:42.667
Oh, we can fix that.

03:42.667 --> 03:44.458
Let the reeducation begin.

03:44.458 --> 03:47.333
Kristophe, hit
the energy efficient lights.

03:52.250 --> 03:55.834
Aah! The tint of the glow
is slightly off.

03:59.834 --> 04:01.250
Wake up, G-man.

04:01.250 --> 04:02.875
It's time
to hear the truth.

04:02.875 --> 04:05.333
And the most
efficient way to
convey that truth?

04:05.333 --> 04:06.834
Poetry slam.

society's bruise.

04:20.166 --> 04:22.000

04:22.000 --> 04:24.333
Because "pobody's nerfect."

04:28.792 --> 04:30.458
Hello. I'm Ira Glass.

04:31.667 --> 04:32.834
Today, on This American Life,

04:32.834 --> 04:35.500
we have a story about a dog.

04:35.500 --> 04:38.375
And like most dogs...

04:38.375 --> 04:40.333
this dog has an owner.

04:40.333 --> 04:41.542
But here's the thing:

04:41.542 --> 04:43.959
This dog's owner...

04:43.959 --> 04:45.875
also happens to be...

04:45.875 --> 04:47.083
a dog.

04:47.083 --> 04:49.083
Why is he pausing?

04:49.083 --> 04:52.041
Doesn't he know
what he wants to say next?

04:52.041 --> 04:54.667
Doesn't he have it written down
right in front of him?

05:01.000 --> 05:03.125
We've just received
a disturbing report

05:03.125 --> 05:05.000
that a local man
has been kidnapped

05:05.000 --> 05:07.166
by radical Occupy protesters,

05:07.166 --> 05:09.041
and subjected
to Heaven knows what.

05:09.041 --> 05:10.417
Journalistic
ethics prevent us

05:10.417 --> 05:12.000
from releasing
the man's name.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.250
But, between you and
me, it's Stan Smith.

05:14.250 --> 05:15.583
Stan?!
Daddy?!

05:15.583 --> 05:17.583
Dad...?
Ow! Hangnail.

05:17.583 --> 05:21.250
"We are a radical arm
of the Occupy movement.

05:21.250 --> 05:23.125
"We have several demands.

05:23.125 --> 05:26.375
"The rich should give
their money to the poor.

05:26.375 --> 05:30.333
"Then the new rich should give
their money to the new poor.

05:30.333 --> 05:33.375
"And then they should go
round and round like the...

05:33.375 --> 05:34.959
the Sneeches?"

05:34.959 --> 05:36.500
Is that what that is?

05:36.500 --> 05:39.125
"Also, there should be
a one-year waiting period

05:39.125 --> 05:40.709
"to get a gun.

05:40.709 --> 05:44.583
And at the end of that year,
you don't get a gun."

05:44.583 --> 05:46.834
Witnesses report that
the victim stood out

05:46.834 --> 05:49.166
because he was wearing
mirrored narc shades.

05:49.166 --> 05:50.542
Oh, my God.

05:50.542 --> 05:52.792
I told Dad to wear
those sunglasses.

05:52.792 --> 05:54.291
This is all
my fault.

05:54.291 --> 05:55.583
Well, then you
better just hope

05:55.583 --> 05:58.166
he doesn't get out
of there alive.

05:59.834 --> 06:01.041
Roger, what
are you doing?

06:01.041 --> 06:02.792
Well, with your
dad missing,

06:02.792 --> 06:04.750
it's only a matter of time
before hundreds of people

06:04.750 --> 06:06.583
show up for a
candlelight vigil.

06:06.583 --> 06:08.250
20 bucks a candle?

06:08.250 --> 06:09.709
Tha-that seems
a little steep.

06:09.709 --> 06:11.542
Friends and family
get ten for a hundred,

06:11.542 --> 06:13.792
but we're not related
and I don't really
care for you,

06:13.792 --> 06:14.834
so it's 20 bucks.

06:14.834 --> 06:16.041
Oh, my God, Mom,

06:16.041 --> 06:17.333
I'm so worried.

06:17.333 --> 06:19.583
What if... What if Dad
doesn't come back?

06:19.583 --> 06:21.333
Then you'll have
killed your father.

06:21.333 --> 06:23.750
Do I really need
to explain this to you?

06:25.208 --> 06:26.709
Stan?

06:26.709 --> 06:28.542
Oh, Dad, thank God you're okay.

06:28.542 --> 06:29.875
We heard you were
kidnapped.

06:29.875 --> 06:31.000
First, I'm not a kid.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.875
So the term is
"man-napped."

06:32.875 --> 06:36.166
And second, I escaped
my kidnappers.

06:36.166 --> 06:38.333
Oh, God, that's
2,000 more candles.

06:38.333 --> 06:39.959
Nobody sign for that.
Just ignore him.

06:39.959 --> 06:41.625
He'll go away.

06:45.083 --> 06:46.166
Hey, Dad.

06:46.166 --> 06:47.625
What are you doing?

06:47.625 --> 06:50.166
Oh, just listening
to my boy-eeee Glenn Beck.

06:50.166 --> 06:51.750
Did you know
America's dead?

06:51.750 --> 06:53.500
Pulled into the
world garage,

06:53.500 --> 06:54.834
left the engine running,

06:54.834 --> 06:56.500
flipped on some
Roy Orbison and just...

06:56.500 --> 06:58.041
let go.

06:58.041 --> 07:01.083
Dad, I just
came in to say...

07:01.083 --> 07:03.542
Well, I-I'm just really
happy that you're home.

07:03.542 --> 07:05.000
Good night.

07:14.917 --> 07:15.917
Hello.

07:15.917 --> 07:17.709
I'm Ira Glass.

07:17.709 --> 07:20.208
With a $35 pledge...

07:20.208 --> 07:22.125
you can get the feeling...

07:22.125 --> 07:24.166
of paying for radio.

07:25.083 --> 07:27.083
It's an indescribable...

07:27.083 --> 07:28.250
sensation.

07:28.250 --> 07:30.667
Ah, yeah.

07:37.083 --> 07:38.458
Okay, I figured
it out.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.542
We took a big hit on
all those candles.

07:40.542 --> 07:41.583
"We?"

07:41.583 --> 07:43.125
Yeah, it's a family problem.

07:43.125 --> 07:45.250
Every problem in this house
is a family problem.

07:45.250 --> 07:46.458
Except your problems.

07:46.458 --> 07:48.375
Anyway, you each owe me $400.

07:48.375 --> 07:49.542
Mom, can you
spot me?

07:49.542 --> 07:50.834
Steve, you're
not paying him.

07:50.834 --> 07:52.458
None of us are
paying you, Roger.

07:52.458 --> 07:54.458
But I've got 3,500
candles up there.

07:54.458 --> 07:56.417
How the hell
am I supposed
to unload them?

07:56.417 --> 07:58.792
Make wax statues
of Viggo Mortensen?

07:58.792 --> 08:00.458
Ooh, first thought,
best thought.

08:01.208 --> 08:02.458
Hey, everybody.

08:02.458 --> 08:03.750
I'm off to my study

08:03.750 --> 08:05.083
to swaddle myself
in the American flag

08:05.083 --> 08:06.583
and pretend
I'm Baby Jesus.

08:06.583 --> 08:07.792
But, before I go,

08:07.792 --> 08:09.500
I wanted to hand out
your allowances.

08:09.500 --> 08:10.625
We get
allowances?

08:10.625 --> 08:12.208
I know I do
all the work,

08:12.208 --> 08:13.834
but we're not
just a family.

08:13.834 --> 08:16.542
We're a collective.

08:16.542 --> 08:19.792
Oh, my God, don't you guys
realize what just happened?

08:19.792 --> 08:21.333
Your dad cut
one and left?

08:21.333 --> 08:24.083
Yes, but he's also
redistributing his wealth.

08:24.083 --> 08:26.625
The dad I know would
consider that un-American.

08:26.625 --> 08:28.208
Haley, I-I'd think
you'd be happy

08:28.208 --> 08:30.417
that Dad is starting to
think a little like you.

08:30.417 --> 08:33.208
I would if it was real,
but it's so weird.

08:33.208 --> 08:35.834
He's still talking
like he did in that video.

08:35.834 --> 08:37.250
I wonder...

08:37.250 --> 08:38.709
Why I'm listening to you
instead of hustling

08:38.709 --> 08:39.917
down to the
fireworks stand

08:39.917 --> 08:41.583

windfall?

08:42.875 --> 08:44.375

09:58.792 --> 10:00.417
It looks like he's being robbed.

10:02.542 --> 10:04.417
What?!
It's true.

10:04.417 --> 10:06.125
I was robbed
by a homeless.

10:06.125 --> 10:07.250
Haley!

10:07.250 --> 10:08.583
Your father was
getting mugged

10:08.583 --> 10:10.709
and you just sat there,
snapping photos?

10:10.709 --> 10:12.041
Hilarious.

10:12.041 --> 10:14.417
I-I swear,
he didn't have a gun.

10:14.417 --> 10:17.542
Dad, you may be able
to use your CIA tech

10:17.542 --> 10:19.875
to hack my phone
and doctor a photo,

10:19.875 --> 10:22.583
but you can't
doctor real life.

10:24.583 --> 10:26.750
But... that was
a peace sign.

10:26.750 --> 10:28.333
Oh, I see why
you're confused.

10:28.333 --> 10:31.083
Reagan's just at peace
shredding waves.

10:31.083 --> 10:32.000
I'm not crazy.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.083
I know what I saw.

10:34.083 --> 10:35.917
Oh, I've got some
bad news, guys.

10:35.917 --> 10:37.250
I have to sell
the piano.

10:37.250 --> 10:39.625
Aw.

10:45.500 --> 10:48.041
Sorry, I'll be out of
your hair in a minute.

10:48.041 --> 10:49.667
Just looking
for a flashlight.

10:49.667 --> 10:51.375
Oh, here it is.

10:51.375 --> 10:54.750
Shadow puppet
practice, commence!

10:58.083 --> 10:59.458
It's all in the pinky.

10:59.458 --> 11:01.834
What's wrong, little buddy?

11:01.834 --> 11:04.083
I'm ruined!
All these candles!

11:04.083 --> 11:06.166
You can't find
anyone to buy them?

11:06.166 --> 11:07.834
I offered them
to Yankee Candles,

11:07.834 --> 11:09.709
but they said
they had enough candles.

11:09.709 --> 11:11.417
I don't understand
business!

11:11.417 --> 11:12.709
Don't give up, Roger.

11:12.709 --> 11:14.959
You just got to
look on the...

11:14.959 --> 11:16.917
bright side.

11:18.417 --> 11:20.959
Oh, it feels good to laugh.

11:20.959 --> 11:23.875
Thanks for reminding me how.

11:26.792 --> 11:28.250
It's like I'm looking at you

11:28.250 --> 11:30.208
through the eyes
of Vilmos Zsigmond,

11:30.208 --> 11:32.500
cinematographer
of Close Encounters.

11:32.500 --> 11:34.083
I know Vilmos.

11:34.083 --> 11:37.458
I was his favorite extra.

11:38.792 --> 11:42.208
God, there's so much
I don't know about you.

11:42.208 --> 11:44.417
I should probably go.

11:44.417 --> 11:45.667
Why?

11:45.667 --> 11:48.208
Two friends lit
by candlelight.

11:48.208 --> 11:50.208
What could go wrong?

11:50.208 --> 11:52.125
The question is...

11:52.125 --> 11:55.333
what could go right?

11:55.333 --> 11:58.917
How 'bout I light
a few more?

12:11.959 --> 12:14.083
All right, Stan Smith,

12:14.083 --> 12:17.041
let's see what you're hiding.

12:27.834 --> 12:29.875
Sorry, Hayley.

12:29.875 --> 12:33.750
Sorry you picked a fish
for your stupid plan.

12:33.750 --> 12:35.667
No, Dad!

12:35.667 --> 12:38.000
I can't let you do this.
What do you mean?

12:38.000 --> 12:40.834
I saw your computer screen.
I know you were searching

12:40.834 --> 12:43.333
for "Secret Back Roads
to National Monuments."

12:43.333 --> 12:45.834
Oh, Hayley, Hayley, Hayley.

12:45.834 --> 12:48.375
I've been planning a road trip
for the family

12:48.375 --> 12:50.792
to see all of our country's
greatest monuments.

12:50.792 --> 12:53.000
And of course we'll take
the secret back roads.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.208
You always want to enter a park
from behind.

12:55.208 --> 12:58.000
Not many parks will let you,
but if you find one that will,

12:58.000 --> 12:59.959
they'll pretty much
let you do anything.

12:59.959 --> 13:01.250
Dad, one of the Web sites was

13:01.250 --> 13:03.250
"How to Blow Up
National Monuments."

13:03.250 --> 13:05.500
Hayley, Hayley, Hayley.

13:05.500 --> 13:07.375
"Blow Up." It's street jive.

13:07.375 --> 13:09.709
It means
to make something popular.

13:09.709 --> 13:12.208
Attendance at the national
monuments is dwindling,

13:12.208 --> 13:14.417
baby girl, and Daddy's worried.

13:14.417 --> 13:15.625
Okay...

13:15.625 --> 13:17.834
I-I guess
that makes sense.

13:17.834 --> 13:20.208
Um, just
one more question.

13:20.208 --> 13:23.875
Why is there a crate
of missiles tied to your car?

13:23.875 --> 13:27.250
Hayley, Hayley, Hayley.

13:29.208 --> 13:31.792
You just couldn't let it rest,
could you?

13:36.375 --> 13:38.959
Damn, Hayley, how
much do you weigh?

13:41.208 --> 13:43.458
Daddy?

13:43.458 --> 13:44.542
What's going on?

13:44.542 --> 13:45.875
You were right, Hayley.

13:45.875 --> 13:47.959
I'm a warrior now
for the liberal left,

13:47.959 --> 13:50.083
and we're about to move forward
with an attack

13:50.083 --> 13:52.041
that the world's right-wing
puppet masters

13:52.041 --> 13:53.875
will never forget.

13:55.542 --> 13:57.000
Oh, by the way,
these are my friends

13:57.000 --> 13:59.041
who kidnapped
and brainwashed me.

13:59.041 --> 14:00.458
This one's a wheelchair guy,

14:00.458 --> 14:02.542
but he can still talk
and everything.

14:09.959 --> 14:11.667
Dad, what are
you gonna do?

14:11.667 --> 14:12.875
Are you...

14:12.875 --> 14:14.625
are you gonna blow up
Mount Rushmore?

14:14.625 --> 14:15.917
Oh, no. Way cooler.

14:15.917 --> 14:18.083
Artemis, show her.

14:20.291 --> 14:22.208
By precisely targeting
a barrage of missiles

14:22.208 --> 14:24.208
your dad acquired for us,
we'll reshape

14:24.208 --> 14:26.250
the contemptible fascists
of Mount Rushmore

14:26.250 --> 14:28.166
into history's
greatest leftists.

14:28.166 --> 14:31.792
Sean Penn, Michael Moore
and Captain Planet.

14:31.792 --> 14:33.417
Why didn't you change Jefferson?

14:33.417 --> 14:35.083
Well, he freed the slaves, so...

14:35.083 --> 14:36.792
he stays.

14:37.709 --> 14:40.000
I can't believe this.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.291
We're going through
with this, Hayley.

14:41.291 --> 14:43.166
No use trying
to talk me out of it.

14:43.166 --> 14:44.458
I'm not going to.

14:44.458 --> 14:46.041
I think it's awesome.

14:46.041 --> 14:48.500
Really?
Dad, this is exactly
what I've been trying

14:48.500 --> 14:50.625
to get you to embrace
all these years.

14:50.625 --> 14:52.875
Now we can work together
to bring down the...

14:52.875 --> 14:54.333
Plutocratic, patriarchal,

14:54.333 --> 14:56.166
military industrial complex!

14:57.709 --> 15:00.375
I can't wait to help
you guys pull this off,

15:00.375 --> 15:02.583
but, um, can I go
to the bathroom real quick?

15:02.583 --> 15:04.667
I'm going to enjoy
a movement of my own.

15:04.667 --> 15:06.959
Clever!

15:13.333 --> 15:15.208
- Hello?
- Avery, it's Hayley.

15:15.208 --> 15:17.375
I have to talk to you.
I was kidnapped.

15:17.375 --> 15:20.709
Stop right there.
Let me switch to a secure line.

15:20.709 --> 15:22.125
All right.

15:22.125 --> 15:25.667
When you were kidnapped,
what were you wearing?

15:25.667 --> 15:28.333
Do you currently
have access to your nipples?

15:28.333 --> 15:32.375
What? N-No, Avery, I-I was
kidnapped by terrorists.

15:32.375 --> 15:35.542
Oh, my God, you're so bad
at sexy phone calls.

15:35.542 --> 15:37.000
Damn it!

15:37.000 --> 15:38.792
Come on, come on, come on.

15:38.792 --> 15:42.792
Mmm. I don't know where your
back ends and my hands begin.

15:42.792 --> 15:45.750
Oh! The outside world.

15:45.750 --> 15:48.375
- Hello?
- Roger, it's Hayley.

15:48.375 --> 15:50.417
Look, I've been
kidnapped by my dad.

15:50.417 --> 15:51.959
He's working
with terrorists...

15:51.959 --> 15:53.834
Hayley, my hands are dripping
with coconut oil.

15:53.834 --> 15:55.125
I can't talk.

15:56.792 --> 15:59.041
Now, where were we?

15:59.041 --> 16:01.917
Oh... yeah, here.

16:03.792 --> 16:06.291
Steve? Roger?

16:06.291 --> 16:08.458
Are you up there?

16:09.625 --> 16:11.792
What? Wh-What have
we been doing?!

16:11.792 --> 16:14.125
I-It must have been
the candles, right?

16:14.125 --> 16:16.291
Get out.

16:17.750 --> 16:19.917
911, what is your emergency?

16:19.917 --> 16:22.458
Betraitor!

16:24.667 --> 16:26.417
All right, Stan.

16:26.417 --> 16:28.792
Finish setting up the launcher
while we go get high for this.

16:28.792 --> 16:32.500
I want to be as high
as I was during Life of Pi.

16:36.250 --> 16:38.792
Dad, don't do this.
This isn't you.

16:38.792 --> 16:40.375
Hayley, you should be happy.

16:40.375 --> 16:42.625
I'm a leftist radical,
just like you are.

16:42.625 --> 16:44.709
But that's not
who you are.

16:44.709 --> 16:47.000
You've always hated
my liberal ideas.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.667
Remember how mad you got when I
filled your gas tank with sugar

16:49.667 --> 16:52.041
to encourage you
to ride my bike to work?

16:54.250 --> 16:58.375
The chain kept coming off and I
had to ask a weird man for help.

16:59.250 --> 17:01.625
Yeah. Yeah!

17:01.625 --> 17:04.083
It made you really mad,
didn't it?

17:04.083 --> 17:08.083
But, but I did reduce my carbon
footprint for two days, so...

17:08.083 --> 17:09.375
well done.

17:09.375 --> 17:11.458
Okay, but remember
how upset you got

17:11.458 --> 17:13.917
when my fourth grade teacher
asked what you did on Career Day

17:13.917 --> 17:17.000
and I said you introduced crack
and AIDS to the ghetto?

17:17.000 --> 17:20.041
I've told you time and again
that AIDS was the FBI.

17:20.041 --> 17:22.458
But, but it's good
to be sensitive

17:22.458 --> 17:25.667
to the socioeconomically
disadvantaged and their pain.

17:25.667 --> 17:27.542
Yeah? Well, what about your pain

17:27.542 --> 17:30.083
when me and my friends protested
on our front lawn

17:30.083 --> 17:31.667
for four months?

17:34.000 --> 17:35.875
I'd just had that lawn seeded.

17:35.875 --> 17:37.709
All those hippies urinating...

17:37.709 --> 17:40.750
But, but I guess
you did raise awareness for...

17:40.750 --> 17:42.917
for...

17:44.125 --> 17:45.583
...for nothing!

17:45.583 --> 17:47.166
It wasn't even clear
what you were protesting!

17:47.166 --> 17:49.500
Were you against soap?
Getting jobs?

17:49.500 --> 17:51.125
Having sex in private?!

17:51.125 --> 17:53.291
All right, Stan,
we're ready.

17:53.291 --> 17:54.625
Launch the missiles.

17:54.625 --> 17:57.291
Launch? I-I...

17:57.291 --> 17:59.333
I can't.

17:59.333 --> 18:01.291
Why not? Are you all right?

18:01.291 --> 18:02.333
Yes.

18:02.333 --> 18:04.166
You had me all left.

18:04.166 --> 18:06.542
But now I'm all right.

18:06.542 --> 18:09.333
I don't understand.
What's he... Oh, I get it.

18:09.333 --> 18:12.041
He's using "right"
in the political sense.

18:12.041 --> 18:14.458
His brainwashing's
been compromised!

18:14.458 --> 18:16.291
Seize him!

18:30.583 --> 18:33.000
Dude! You wouldn't hurt a guy
in a wheelchair.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.417
Of course not.

18:34.417 --> 18:36.875
But I would hurt a guy
with his wheelchair.

18:42.083 --> 18:44.000
Dad? Are you really back?

18:44.000 --> 18:45.375
Yes, Hayley, I am.

18:45.375 --> 18:47.500
It seems the only
force strong enough

18:47.500 --> 18:49.041
to break their brainwashing

18:49.041 --> 18:51.792
was a lifetime of
disappointment in my daughter.

18:51.792 --> 18:53.291
It is you!

18:53.291 --> 18:55.291
Dad!

18:59.792 --> 19:02.333
Oh, no!
What have I done?

19:19.041 --> 19:21.583
What... what the hell
just happened?

19:23.709 --> 19:25.250
Well done, Smith.

19:25.250 --> 19:27.000
Or should I say, Smiths.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.417
Deputy Director Bullock?

19:28.417 --> 19:29.792
Let me explain.

19:29.792 --> 19:31.625
We needed
to test Mount Rushmore's

19:31.625 --> 19:33.667
new anti-missile
laser defense,

19:33.667 --> 19:36.291
so we figured
the easiest way to do that

19:36.291 --> 19:39.208
would be to brainwash
our most loyal agent

19:39.208 --> 19:40.917
into firing missiles at it.

19:40.917 --> 19:42.458
Really?
That was the easiest way?

19:42.458 --> 19:44.083
No.

19:44.083 --> 19:47.166
But South Dakota had a lot
of Homeland Security funds

19:47.166 --> 19:49.083
just sitting around,
so we figured

19:49.083 --> 19:51.166
we should do
something cool with it.

19:51.166 --> 19:52.792
Are you insane?!

19:52.792 --> 19:55.709
Millions of kids go to bed
hungry every night,

19:55.709 --> 19:59.208
but you waste money making
Abe Lincoln into a Transformer?

19:59.208 --> 20:00.625
God, you're annoying.

20:00.625 --> 20:02.166
Everything you say
is annoying.

20:02.166 --> 20:03.583
This guy gets it.

20:03.583 --> 20:06.375
Smith, let me introduce you
to the CIA agents

20:06.375 --> 20:09.291
who pretended to be
anticapitalist activists

20:09.291 --> 20:11.750
so they could kidnap
and brainwash you.

20:13.125 --> 20:14.333
Duper?!

20:14.333 --> 20:15.667
Jackson?!

20:15.667 --> 20:18.166
Oh, my God,
those disguises are amazing!

20:18.166 --> 20:19.709
That's because
they're made

20:19.709 --> 20:21.792
with real skin
from the Orient.

20:21.792 --> 20:24.000
Wait a minute, then-then
who was playing Artemis?

20:24.000 --> 20:26.500
Oh, he was actually
a dangerous activist.

20:26.500 --> 20:28.166
So good job beating
him to death.

20:28.166 --> 20:30.959
He did have a child that may
come for vengeance someday,

20:30.959 --> 20:32.792
but he's also
in a wheelchair,

20:32.792 --> 20:34.834
so walk halfway
up a staircase

20:34.834 --> 20:37.166
or find a curb,
you'll be fine.

20:40.625 --> 20:43.625
Well, Dad, it really
is good to have you back.

20:43.625 --> 20:45.542
It's good to be back, Hayley.

20:45.542 --> 20:47.500
Come on, let's go home.

20:47.500 --> 20:49.333
Well, we've got a long
drive ahead of us.

20:49.333 --> 20:50.875
What are we gonna
