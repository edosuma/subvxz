00:02.517 --> 00:05.076
- Hello, I'm Millie and
today I'm going to show you

00:05.077 --> 00:06.772
some gymnastics.

00:06.773 --> 00:09.393
The first move is the splits.

00:16.885 --> 00:20.297
And then, they complicate.

00:20.298 --> 00:23.295
And statistics say that
I'll meet the one at 23,

00:23.296 --> 00:25.737
so why bother for the
next seven years?

00:25.738 --> 00:27.998
I don't want to be broken
up with and I don't want

00:27.999 --> 00:30.675
to have to tell some guy I
don't like him anymore.

00:30.676 --> 00:32.777
It will all end in trouble.

00:32.778 --> 00:35.977
Number four, they're messy.

00:37.215 --> 00:38.216
That's it.

00:40.000 --> 00:46.074

00:51.550 --> 00:53.394
And then I do the same
with the other side.

00:53.395 --> 00:55.773
But you want it to
look really neat.

00:55.774 --> 00:59.037
'Cause if it looks neat,
then it looks really pretty!

01:06.268 --> 01:09.586
I know I said I didn't
want a boyfriend,

01:11.229 --> 01:12.566
but...

01:14.076 --> 01:17.031
I met him, tonight.

01:20.999 --> 01:23.845
- My name's Daisy and I can't
wait to pour these baked

01:23.846 --> 01:26.064
beans all over my skin.

01:50.287 --> 01:52.004
- Yeah, yeah!

02:44.119 --> 02:45.323
- Bal?

02:45.324 --> 02:47.435
- Reese, it's...

02:47.436 --> 02:51.083
it's Julia, she's um...

02:51.084 --> 02:52.640
- She's what?

02:52.641 --> 02:54.581
- She looks
like she's dead.

02:54.582 --> 02:56.736
I've just seen her taken
out of her house,

02:56.737 --> 02:58.858
there's an ambulance
and everything.

02:58.859 --> 03:00.298
- What happened?

03:00.299 --> 03:02.315
- I don't know, I'm not sure.

03:04.224 --> 03:05.439
- You're not sure?

03:05.440 --> 03:07.157
How can you not be sure?

03:08.181 --> 03:08.949
Bal?

03:08.950 --> 03:10.548
- Just stay hidden.

03:10.549 --> 03:12.724
After last night the police
will be looking for you.

03:12.725 --> 03:14.143
- Bal, is she okay?

03:14.144 --> 03:17.342
- Okay look, I'll find out what's
happened and where she is.

03:17.343 --> 03:19.668
I'll meet you at 10
under the bridge.

03:19.669 --> 03:22.041
Just don't do anything stupid.

03:24.052 --> 03:25.385
Hello? Reese?

03:25.386 --> 03:27.090
- 10, if you're not there...

03:27.091 --> 03:28.510
- I'll be there.

03:28.511 --> 03:30.004
- Don't be late.

03:31.166 --> 03:32.692
- Ditch your phone.

03:38.412 --> 03:41.224
- So, Ty Chapman and Marc
Mercer, both confirmed dead

03:41.225 --> 03:43.026
from severe head injuries.

03:43.027 --> 03:45.149
Estimated time, midnight.

03:45.150 --> 03:47.889
Balthazar Williams, Reese
Mattson, these two persons of

03:47.890 --> 03:49.537
interest are currently missing.

03:56.477 --> 04:00.006
Reese is our main suspect.

04:00.007 --> 04:03.206
Lead officer O'Rourke
will brief you further.

04:03.207 --> 04:05.307
Now, there's a lot of
attention on this.

04:05.308 --> 04:07.601
They're not gang members,
parents will be worried that

04:07.602 --> 04:09.360
it could happen to them, okay?

04:09.361 --> 04:11.510
Tread lightly, thank you.

04:12.444 --> 04:14.224
- Okay, we've got
eyes on both of their houses.

04:14.225 --> 04:16.464
The search warrants are
about to be issued.

04:16.464 --> 04:18.512
Any questions from
anyone at this stage?

04:43.205 --> 04:44.047
- Yes?

04:44.048 --> 04:45.423
- Balthazar Williams.

04:46.884 --> 04:48.110
I'm detective O'Rourke.

04:48.111 --> 04:49.849
I'm arresting you for aiding
and abetting the murders

04:49.850 --> 04:51.886
of Mark Mercer and Ty Chapman.

04:51.887 --> 04:53.806
Do you understand? - Yes.

04:53.807 --> 04:56.568
- I've also got a warrant
here to search your premises

04:56.569 --> 04:58.808
and seize any items
relevant to these crimes.

04:58.809 --> 05:02.029
Including telephones, computers,
and electronic equipment.

05:02.030 --> 05:03.880
- Hey, be careful with that!

05:07.933 --> 05:09.421
Wait!

05:09.422 --> 05:11.171
I need to feed the cat.

05:11.172 --> 05:12.798
Monty will starve.

05:34.808 --> 05:36.748
- Close that account
today, okay?

05:36.749 --> 05:38.668
You've made yourself
look like...

05:38.669 --> 05:41.185
Yeah, well you've
humiliated me too.

05:41.186 --> 05:43.031
No, I don't trust you
anymore how ca...

05:48.694 --> 05:50.242
Search record.

05:53.718 --> 05:54.593
Did you get it all?

05:54.594 --> 05:56.069
- Yeah.
- Okay.

06:05.238 --> 06:07.829
Listen, I want Hughie
in the room with us,

06:07.830 --> 06:10.746
get a copy, get him to hook
it up to the screen, yeah?

06:15.829 --> 06:17.929
- Is that her? No
wonder she's rabid.

06:17.930 --> 06:19.209
- She's got Dalton's arse.

06:19.210 --> 06:20.617
- Hey!

06:20.618 --> 06:22.111
Back to work.

06:22.112 --> 06:24.148
- The next thing
I'm going to show you...

06:24.149 --> 06:25.951
- Family is off limits!

06:27.733 --> 06:29.386
- Shoes.

06:34.576 --> 06:36.169
Any health issues?

06:42.810 --> 06:44.334
- Balthazar.

06:44.335 --> 06:46.617
My name's Laurence Emerson.

06:46.618 --> 06:48.409
I'm your appropriate adult.

06:48.410 --> 06:51.054
It's my job to make sure
that you know your rights

06:51.055 --> 06:54.490
and to explain anything to you
that you don't understand.

07:02.350 --> 07:03.501
- Do you need to
take five minutes?

07:03.502 --> 07:04.734
- No.

07:06.201 --> 07:08.126
That's not what she posted.

07:08.127 --> 07:10.334
That was some twisted little...

07:10.335 --> 07:12.323
She's just a girl.

07:51.026 --> 07:52.662
- It is relevant.

07:53.809 --> 07:55.248
- I've caught that one before.

07:55.249 --> 07:57.030
- What haven't you seen?

07:57.031 --> 07:58.897
- I get my kicks out of
watching people inflict pain

07:58.898 --> 08:00.818
on themselves, yeah, sue me.

08:01.948 --> 08:02.941
Let's keep our eyes open.

08:02.942 --> 08:05.222
I want to find out the way
that he stages his reality.

08:05.223 --> 08:07.964
- Balthazar's posted thousands.

08:09.500 --> 08:12.534
- Just prioritize his digital
footprints for the past 24 hours.

08:14.246 --> 08:16.581
Mate, can we get
some tea please?

08:16.582 --> 08:18.128
That normal stuff, yeah?

08:18.129 --> 08:20.091
None of that green kumbaya shit.

08:24.838 --> 08:26.837
- This clone is nearly finished.

08:32.187 --> 08:33.438
- Hey.

08:42.767 --> 08:44.275
- Take a seat.

08:56.164 --> 08:59.735
Operating the computer is Mr.
Hughes and you've already

08:59.736 --> 09:03.042
met your appropriate adult, Mr.
Emerson.

09:03.043 --> 09:05.080
- and trained psychologist.

09:07.662 --> 09:10.945
Balthazar, I know this
is a bit scary, but,

09:10.946 --> 09:14.834
Detective Dalton is merely
concerned with the truth.

09:16.461 --> 09:17.874
You okay?

09:18.765 --> 09:19.746
You want something to eat?

09:19.747 --> 09:20.748
Did he have breakfast?

09:20.749 --> 09:22.722
- He's 17, not seven!

09:26.950 --> 09:28.677
- How long will this take?

09:28.678 --> 09:30.555
- You've heard the news.

09:34.545 --> 09:36.053
They're dead.

09:37.808 --> 09:39.274
Murdered.

09:40.741 --> 09:42.725
- What's this got to do with me?

09:44.762 --> 09:46.569
- Marc was your friend?

09:49.076 --> 09:50.771
You don't seem too upset.

09:50.772 --> 09:52.894
- Of course I'm upset.

09:55.529 --> 09:57.624
- You're very good at
hiding your emotions.

10:00.392 --> 10:01.437
Where's Reese?

10:01.438 --> 10:03.656
- I don't know anything.

10:04.851 --> 10:07.933
- Guilty lying boys are
a very easy target.

10:12.445 --> 10:14.786
You need to decide how
helpful you're going to be.

10:16.029 --> 10:18.731
Mr. Hughes, now watch.

10:26.215 --> 10:30.299
This CCTV is from the multi-storey
car park in Peckham. STOREY

10:30.300 --> 10:34.139
It shows Marc being beaten
up and crawling away.

10:34.140 --> 10:37.424
He was found with a
broken neck, dead,

10:37.425 --> 10:39.430
on the other side of the wall.

10:40.514 --> 10:42.956
We found Ty outside
the car park.

10:42.957 --> 10:46.134
He fell, or was pushed,
three stories to his death.

10:46.135 --> 10:48.875
Turns out woolly hats aren't
as good as crash helmets

10:48.876 --> 10:50.977
in a high impact situation.

10:52.033 --> 10:53.947
But you already knew
that, didn't you?

10:57.504 --> 11:00.523
You say you don't know anything,

11:00.524 --> 11:02.518
but I know some things.

11:05.163 --> 11:09.591
The lad being beaten
up, Marc Mercer, dead.

11:11.325 --> 11:15.149
The boy with the woolly
hat, Ty Chapman, also dead.

11:17.821 --> 11:21.020
The boy with the dark hair
who helped chase them away?

11:21.021 --> 11:24.763
Reese Mattson, missing.

11:24.764 --> 11:27.878
And the boy who video
taped it all was you.

11:27.879 --> 11:29.750
I want that camera footage.

11:35.164 --> 11:38.614
- Balthazar, do you
understand what she's saying?

11:45.499 --> 11:47.099
- What?

11:48.635 --> 11:50.565
- My camera dropped.

11:50.566 --> 11:53.888
- So it was you in the footage?

11:55.003 --> 11:56.276
And Reese?

11:57.626 --> 12:00.356
- The card fell out, I lost it.

12:00.357 --> 12:04.164
- We have experts going through
your cameras, computers,

12:04.165 --> 12:05.784
and phone.

12:05.785 --> 12:10.595
If you're lying, Mr. Hughes'
team will find out.

12:10.596 --> 12:13.150
- We always win digital
hide and seek.

12:15.065 --> 12:16.787
- I don't have it, I swear.

12:17.625 --> 12:18.840
It got lost when the
camera dropped.

12:18.841 --> 12:20.035
- Where?

12:20.036 --> 12:20.900
- What?

12:20.901 --> 12:23.096
- Where exactly did it fall out?

12:23.097 --> 12:24.760
- We were running away.

12:24.761 --> 12:27.257
Do you not have the CCTV
from outside the garage?

12:31.187 --> 12:33.751
- Lucky for us you can
tell us all about it.

12:33.752 --> 12:35.831
- I don't know anything.

12:35.832 --> 12:39.670
- We have your testimony
that you witnessed a murder,

12:39.671 --> 12:41.036
but didn't come forward.

12:41.037 --> 12:42.935
That's withholding.

12:42.936 --> 12:46.327
There's another boy dead,
possibly at your hand,

12:46.328 --> 12:48.909
that's murder,
manslaughter, at least.

12:57.684 --> 12:59.121
- Fine.

13:03.585 --> 13:06.891
I'll answer your questions
and tell you what you want

13:06.892 --> 13:08.789
to know, but that's the truth.

13:08.790 --> 13:11.872
I don't know if Ty fell or what.

13:11.873 --> 13:14.090
- So what was the fight about?

13:14.091 --> 13:17.471
- Ty was mad about Julia.
- Julia?

13:17.472 --> 13:19.327
- Yeah.

13:19.328 --> 13:22.964
Julia Coulson,
Reese's girlfriend.

13:22.965 --> 13:24.564
- We need to track
down a Julia Coulson,

13:24.565 --> 13:26.432
we need to question her.

13:28.512 --> 13:31.012
So tell me about Julia,
how did they meet?

13:35.317 --> 13:39.379
- It was about six weeks
ago, we crashed one of Ty's

13:39.380 --> 13:42.792
house parties, that's
where everything started.

14:01.064 --> 14:02.482
- Excuse me, miss?

14:02.483 --> 14:04.060
Do you have a license for that?

14:04.061 --> 14:05.447
- A license for what?

14:05.448 --> 14:07.921
- You must be over 18 to have
alcohol of the peach variety.

14:07.922 --> 14:09.660
- I'll take the risk, thanks.

14:09.661 --> 14:10.663
- I am so sorry.

14:10.664 --> 14:13.425
My friend desperately
needs to see a therapist.

14:13.426 --> 14:14.801
- It's cool.

14:14.802 --> 14:16.689
I'll see you at the party.

14:19.804 --> 14:22.609
- I want to paint you red and
spank you naughty tomato!

14:22.610 --> 14:24.604
- Yeah, you'd be so lucky!

14:27.431 --> 14:28.454
- That's one for the ho pro.

14:28.455 --> 14:29.552
- Her and Reese, maybe.

14:29.553 --> 14:30.981
- Shut up, Balthatard!

14:30.982 --> 14:32.315
At least I know you're
no competition.

14:32.316 --> 14:34.160
- He's going to make
you famous so be nice.

14:34.161 --> 14:35.920
- Guys, do you think we'll
get out before the firemen

14:35.921 --> 14:36.753
get there?

14:36.754 --> 14:38.234
- Yeah, but after Ty
cries like a baby.

14:38.235 --> 14:39.759
Might even wet himself.

14:39.760 --> 14:40.975
- Who is he, anyway?

14:40.976 --> 14:42.095
- Don't you remember?

14:42.096 --> 14:43.994
Your tackle against St. Mary's?

14:43.995 --> 14:45.519
You broke his leg. - Oh, yeah.

15:06.537 --> 15:09.138
- So the three of you went
there to cause trouble?

15:09.139 --> 15:11.816
- No, it was a prank, a joke.

15:11.817 --> 15:15.448
That's what we do, did.

15:16.254 --> 15:18.013
You can see it on my channel.

15:18.014 --> 15:21.554
It's called The Holy Smoke,
got almost 8,000 hits.

15:21.555 --> 15:23.953
- I saw that one, got
good numbers actually.

15:27.970 --> 15:30.156
- Everyone out!

15:36.142 --> 15:37.761
- Fire, fire, fire.

15:38.492 --> 15:40.071
Have you phoned
the fire brigade?

15:41.351 --> 15:43.100
- And that's when
Reese met Julia?

15:44.060 --> 15:45.221
- Yeah, I've got it on file.

15:45.222 --> 15:46.843
I recorded the whole party.

15:46.844 --> 15:48.742
It's on my computer.

15:54.534 --> 15:55.974
Sorry.

15:58.429 --> 16:00.252
- Just as the beans poured
over her and she's got

16:00.253 --> 16:01.713
like 20,000 hits.

16:01.714 --> 16:03.314
- Total social suicide.

16:04.742 --> 16:07.259
- Reese,
are you all set, yeah?

16:07.260 --> 16:08.817
Two minutes you said, right?

16:10.001 --> 16:11.472
Do you think people
will like it?

16:11.473 --> 16:12.485
Do you think we'll
get a lot of hits?

16:12.486 --> 16:14.085
- Listen, Bal, relax.

16:14.086 --> 16:15.909
- Marc, how long?

16:15.910 --> 16:17.531
- Chill, soon, Freakazard.

16:28.910 --> 16:32.082
- Hey, you're Julia, aren't you?

16:32.952 --> 16:35.202
I was just filming everyone
at the party and talking to

16:35.203 --> 16:37.121
friends, that's
what I like to do.

16:37.122 --> 16:39.479
And I saw Julia across the
room so I went to speak

16:39.480 --> 16:44.044
to her and that's
when it happened.

16:45.655 --> 16:48.843
Hey, um, you're
Julia, aren't you?

16:48.844 --> 16:51.298
- Excuse me, I'm showing
her something important.

16:52.385 --> 16:53.953
- I'm Balthazar.

16:54.849 --> 16:58.016
I, um, I watch your blogs.
- Yeah?

16:58.017 --> 17:01.131
- Yeah, I've got a bit of
an online following, too,

17:01.132 --> 17:04.053
stunts, pranks, fails.

17:04.054 --> 17:06.218
I thought we could,
um, you know,

17:06.219 --> 17:08.137
team up and do a joint video?

17:08.138 --> 17:11.050
- I don't know, I
just blurt things out

17:11.050 --> 17:12.874
and that doesn't
really go with pranks.

17:12.875 --> 17:14.015
Nice to meet you, though.

17:14.016 --> 17:15.156
- Wait, no.

17:15.156 --> 17:17.790
I was thinking, your
angle, it's smart.

17:17.791 --> 17:19.156
Pretending you don't
want a boyfriend.

17:19.156 --> 17:20.393
- I don't want a boyfriend.

17:20.394 --> 17:22.888
- Sure, but there's a
gimmick we could try.

17:22.890 --> 17:24.777
- No, people know it's not real.

17:24.778 --> 17:27.039
They'll never trust
you if it's an act.

17:29.940 --> 17:31.955
- So how does this
relate to the deaths?

17:31.956 --> 17:34.611
- 'Cause Ty hated Reese,
he wanted revenge.

17:34.612 --> 17:36.531
- For playing a practical
joke at his house?

17:36.532 --> 17:38.100
- It wasn't just that.

17:39.017 --> 17:40.840
- Was Julia dating Ty?

17:40.841 --> 17:42.419
- No, it was her cousin.

17:42.420 --> 17:43.720
It was all Reese!

17:43.721 --> 17:44.978
- A coincidence?

17:44.979 --> 17:46.664
- They fell in love.

17:46.665 --> 17:48.701
Go to the next clip,
I can prove it!

17:48.702 --> 17:49.842
- Done already.

17:49.843 --> 17:51.298
- You sit!

17:59.859 --> 18:02.641
- Ty doesn’t like that, look
at Reese stealing the show!

18:02.642 --> 18:05.682
My house, my parents, my bed!

18:07.092 --> 18:09.244
- You think you're funny, huh?

18:09.245 --> 18:11.622
I know this was you and
Reese, I'm going to kill you!

18:11.623 --> 18:13.280
Piss off!

18:15.943 --> 18:17.424
- Don't put that
in the final edit.

18:17.425 --> 18:19.889
- Why was this Marc so
keen on being filmed?

18:21.383 --> 18:23.355
- Oh, his parents posted a
video of him riding a dog

18:23.356 --> 18:24.719
when he was a boy.

18:24.720 --> 18:26.331
Got millions of hits.

18:26.332 --> 18:28.404
That was before you
could make money.

18:28.405 --> 18:30.836
- So he's trying to recreate
his moment of glory?

18:30.837 --> 18:31.776
- We do loads of stunts.

18:31.777 --> 18:34.036
There's this one where um
Marc jumps off of a roof

18:34.037 --> 18:35.742
into a pool, but misses.

18:35.743 --> 18:37.534
- Where's the footage?

18:37.535 --> 18:39.124
What's missing?

18:41.364 --> 18:42.910
- That's it, all of it.

18:42.911 --> 18:45.566
- No, why did you stop
filming in the middle of all

18:45.567 --> 18:46.611
the smoke and chaos?

18:46.612 --> 18:48.286
That doesn't seem like you.

18:48.287 --> 18:50.612
What happened after
everyone went outside?

18:51.710 --> 18:52.819
- Nothing.

18:53.897 --> 18:56.910
- Not on your computer,
but I remember something.

19:00.755 --> 19:02.072
Wow.

19:14.386 --> 19:16.412
- I didn't know it was love.

19:16.413 --> 19:18.566
Besides, the HO PRO
was Marc's thing.

19:18.567 --> 19:20.092
He made me post it!

19:20.093 --> 19:23.569
I removed it straight
away, erased all I could.

19:23.570 --> 19:25.691
- I think as we all know, you
can't fully delete anything

19:25.692 --> 19:27.067
from the interverse.

19:27.068 --> 19:28.529
- Did anyone see this?

19:28.530 --> 19:30.268
- Even I saw it.

19:31.324 --> 19:34.150
- No one told me her
parents were religious.

19:35.654 --> 19:37.248
They freaked.

19:38.300 --> 19:39.872
I told Reese I was sorry.

19:40.742 --> 19:42.244
It was just a joke.

19:42.245 --> 19:44.512
I felt really bad.

19:52.507 --> 19:54.778
- Julia Coulson overdosed
early this morning.

19:54.779 --> 19:55.940
- What?

19:55.941 --> 19:57.945
- She's unconscious so there's
no chance of interviewing

19:57.946 --> 19:59.461
her anytime soon.

20:01.261 --> 20:02.807
- That can't be a coincidence.

20:02.808 --> 20:04.018
- On it.

20:12.546 --> 20:14.722
- When did you last see Julia?

20:19.084 --> 20:21.286
- I tried to find
her this morning.

20:27.115 --> 20:28.838
She's dead, isn't she?

20:31.126 --> 20:32.944
- Why did you go there?

20:39.254 --> 20:43.712
- After last night,
Marc was dead!

20:45.248 --> 20:46.842
Reese had disappeared.

20:50.357 --> 20:51.998
I was scared.

20:58.453 --> 21:00.303
She was my friend, too.

21:04.298 --> 21:05.651
Can I go to the toilet, please?

21:05.652 --> 21:07.315
- So who was the last person
to see her before she

21:07.316 --> 21:08.755
overdosed?

21:08.756 --> 21:11.230
- How would I know? Please!

21:11.231 --> 21:13.768
- I'm sorry, he
does need a break.

21:13.769 --> 21:15.849
- You escort him? YOU ESCORT
HIM Julia’s still alive.

22:42.009 --> 22:43.608
- Dalton.

22:43.609 --> 22:45.186
- How's the boy?

22:45.187 --> 22:47.213
- You should take
it easy on him.

22:47.214 --> 22:49.751
A lad can only take so much
before he goes into meltdown.

22:49.752 --> 22:51.533
- Emerson, you're here to
make sure he understands

22:51.534 --> 22:53.250
the questions, that's all.

22:53.251 --> 22:54.397
- Okay.

22:54.398 --> 22:56.215
- Have him put in a cell.

22:57.203 --> 22:59.392
- You're in charge.

22:59.393 --> 23:01.240
- Damn right, I am.

23:24.828 --> 23:26.817
- Good news about
your friend then, eh?

23:29.628 --> 23:32.569
Seen your YouTube channel,
man, really impressive.

23:32.570 --> 23:34.537
Can tell you're
serious by the hours.

23:35.790 --> 23:37.508
Bit of a YouTuber myself.

23:38.927 --> 23:40.952
- Yeah?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:40.953 --> 23:43.757
Look, Dalton's just a
bit of a tough cookie.

23:43.758 --> 23:46.937
She doesn't get with the
technical stuff, you know?

23:47.950 --> 23:49.828
Which gives me a
profession, I suppose.

23:51.081 --> 23:52.867
Which is cool, you know?

23:55.177 --> 23:56.936
- What was that video
of the gymnast you were

23:56.937 --> 23:58.494
watching earlier?

24:00.638 --> 24:02.002
- Oh!

24:02.003 --> 24:04.035
You don't want to go there.

24:38.705 --> 24:41.291
- I won't be long, just
need a quick look.

24:51.120 --> 24:52.512
Bag it.

25:30.638 --> 25:33.719
- Sir, we're able to access
photo and video exchanges

25:33.720 --> 25:35.547
between Julia and Reese.

25:35.548 --> 25:37.040
- What date was it?

25:37.041 --> 25:38.592
- 15th.

25:41.905 --> 25:43.957
- That was the day
of the smoke party.

25:44.923 --> 25:46.287
Right, get them up
on the big screen.

25:46.288 --> 25:48.068
Dalton wants us to
get a head start.

25:48.069 --> 25:53.069
- What's your favourite
colour, animal, and name?

25:55.813 --> 26:00.813
- White, rabbit, and Reese.

26:02.479 --> 26:03.636
You?

26:04.595 --> 26:07.463
- You're beautiful,
you know that?

26:12.606 --> 26:15.949
I can't stop thinking
about you all the time.

26:16.925 --> 26:18.712
I think I might be in lo...

26:20.104 --> 26:21.592
- Tease.

26:22.622 --> 26:24.679
I'm not afraid to say it.

26:24.680 --> 26:26.210
I know I lo...

26:28.541 --> 26:30.349
- I'll get you for that.

26:31.176 --> 26:32.951
- I hope so.

26:39.399 --> 26:41.665
I wish you were here right now.

26:45.116 --> 26:46.774
Are you crazy?

26:46.775 --> 26:48.555
What are you doing?

26:48.556 --> 26:50.027
- It's your fault!

26:50.028 --> 26:51.760
Come to the window!

26:55.190 --> 26:56.805
- Reese!

27:29.353 --> 27:33.053
My parents made me learn,
obviously I didn't.

27:33.054 --> 27:35.870
So what's your secret skill?

27:37.694 --> 27:39.873
- I was a
child model, catalogue.

27:44.861 --> 27:46.436
- Give us a pose.

27:46.437 --> 27:49.678
- You have to jump off sand
dunes and look longingly

27:49.679 --> 27:51.097
at a puppy.

27:51.098 --> 27:52.280
- Do more.

27:52.281 --> 27:53.294
- Fake running.

27:53.295 --> 27:54.255
The hilarious laugh.

27:54.256 --> 27:55.598
The point at the sky.

27:55.599 --> 27:58.345
Is that your drink
coming our your nose?

28:01.156 --> 28:02.466
- Are you okay?

28:02.467 --> 28:05.346
- Yeah, just bashed
my jaw up yesterday.

28:05.347 --> 28:08.051
Just one more car park
thing and then I'm done.

28:08.942 --> 28:10.317
- But you love it.

28:10.318 --> 28:11.757
- But you don't.

28:11.758 --> 28:12.962
Do you want to come with me?

28:12.963 --> 28:15.746
Or are you still grounded?

28:17.422 --> 28:21.245
- My month of house
arrest is up in two days

28:21.246 --> 28:22.962
and three hours.

28:22.963 --> 28:26.619
So what's your passionate
kiss pose like?

28:26.620 --> 28:28.668
Or is your jaw too sore?

28:31.201 --> 28:32.849
- You're blushing.

28:33.899 --> 28:35.674
- Hold on, hold on, go back!

28:39.297 --> 28:41.893
- Ty caught me coming
back last night.

28:44.022 --> 28:45.919
He said he warned you.

28:45.920 --> 28:48.096
- Nah, it was a lucky swipe.

28:49.462 --> 28:51.263
- Your jaw?

28:51.264 --> 28:53.428
- It was nothing, really.

28:53.429 --> 28:55.744
Except he says he
wants to kill me.

28:57.930 --> 29:00.749
- I don't think my mum's
ever going to get over it.

29:01.682 --> 29:04.093
I'm not the same, I'm
such a disappointment.

29:04.094 --> 29:06.355
I'm every other synonym
for disappointment.

29:07.720 --> 29:10.428
It's like they used
an online thesaurus.

29:10.429 --> 29:12.530
- That's so wrong.

29:15.751 --> 29:18.950
- Ty's going to tell them
you're a gang member,

29:18.951 --> 29:23.233
full of STD's, dealing in drugs.

29:24.263 --> 29:28.779
And they'll listen to him,
they already hate you, and me.

29:31.291 --> 29:33.792
And after Ty's finished with it,

29:35.451 --> 29:37.170
we'll be finished.

29:37.171 --> 29:39.626
- You know what I want to do.

29:41.408 --> 29:43.316
- Reese, you can't
joke about that.

29:43.317 --> 29:46.377
- This is going to
happen, trust me.

29:46.378 --> 29:48.574
Ty will be out of
the way forever.

29:48.575 --> 29:52.798
- Two second clip between
manslaughter and murder.

29:52.799 --> 29:55.315
Right, get Balthazar and
Emerson back in the

29:55.316 --> 29:57.082
interview room.

30:04.865 --> 30:06.208
So did you love her?

30:06.209 --> 30:07.669
- No I
didn't love her!

30:07.670 --> 30:09.685
It was always Reese!

30:09.686 --> 30:12.447
And they we... are my friends!

30:12.448 --> 30:14.186
- But you saw her first!

30:14.187 --> 30:17.225
- Any girl who meets me and
Reese will always choose Reese.

30:17.226 --> 30:19.060
- Have you ever
had a girlfriend?

30:19.061 --> 30:20.608
Hmm?

30:28.915 --> 30:31.689
What was the exact nature
of their relationship?

30:31.690 --> 30:34.665
- I don't know, they
were close, you know?

30:34.666 --> 30:36.553
All over each other
all the time.

30:45.193 --> 30:46.493
- Marc's going to hate this one.

30:46.494 --> 30:48.020
- Oh, is he?

30:48.937 --> 30:50.349
- Just ignore him, I do.

30:51.603 --> 30:53.069
- Go on, kiss.

30:54.185 --> 30:55.527
- That is not going online.

30:55.528 --> 30:57.800
- Only delete nine
seconds, please.

31:00.104 --> 31:01.574
- Come on, Marc's going to
launch himself into the

31:01.575 --> 31:02.972
stinging nettles without us.

31:02.973 --> 31:04.961
- Oh yeah, I can't miss that.

31:13.000 --> 31:14.226
- About time!

31:14.227 --> 31:16.076
You guys ready for this?

31:23.079 --> 31:25.335
Oh, there's dog shit in here!

31:27.602 --> 31:29.478
- Parasite.

31:29.479 --> 31:31.707
- They liked having me around.

31:31.708 --> 31:33.766
- You must've been
jealous of Reese.

31:33.767 --> 31:36.166
Not only did the
camera love him,

31:36.167 --> 31:38.597
but he took away the girl
you wanted to team up with.

31:38.598 --> 31:40.421
- I was never...
- Okay, okay!

31:40.422 --> 31:41.840
So you were jealous of Julia?

31:41.841 --> 31:43.162
She took away the guy that
was going to help you

31:43.163 --> 31:44.346
get that million hits!

31:44.347 --> 31:45.818
- What's your point, inspector?

31:45.819 --> 31:48.037
- You tell me!

31:48.038 --> 31:50.458
- I thought they'd
be good together.

31:50.459 --> 31:52.197
They both had something special.

31:52.198 --> 31:54.117
- So what changed a week ago?

31:55.461 --> 31:56.389
Huh?

31:56.390 --> 31:58.703
We have Reese saying,
and I quote,

31:58.704 --> 32:01.327
"Ty will be out of
the way forever."

32:01.328 --> 32:03.609
Ty wanted to break them up
so they planned on killing

32:03.610 --> 32:05.209
him and you were the accomplice.

32:05.210 --> 32:05.946
- What?

32:05.947 --> 32:07.449
- And we can charge
you right now!

32:07.450 --> 32:08.889
- They were talking
about getting married,

32:08.890 --> 32:10.702
or at least a version of it!

32:10.703 --> 32:11.726
- They're not old enough.

32:11.727 --> 32:12.867
- It's true!

32:12.868 --> 32:15.608
I filmed the entire
ceremony yesterday!

32:15.609 --> 32:17.528
I was the only guest!

32:17.529 --> 32:20.195
The only one they
trusted, actually.

32:20.196 --> 32:22.463
- We didn't see anything.

32:34.607 --> 32:36.910
- Are you honestly telling
me that they thought Ty

32:36.911 --> 32:38.851
would back off once
they got married?

32:38.852 --> 32:40.452
- Yes.
- Bullshit.

32:41.802 --> 32:43.299
Getting married could
only have one result,

32:43.300 --> 32:44.723
further antagonism.

32:44.724 --> 32:46.908
Reese got married
to escalate things.

32:46.909 --> 32:48.882
- No, no, Reese
is not like that.

32:48.883 --> 32:50.728
He wanted to be friends
with Ty, they were family.

32:50.729 --> 32:52.446
- Oh, come on!

32:57.342 --> 33:00.306
Why do you think so
highly of Reese?

33:00.307 --> 33:01.852
- I don't.

33:01.853 --> 33:03.931
It's just the camera
that loves him.

33:03.932 --> 33:06.364
- You are the camera, Balthazar.

33:06.365 --> 33:07.272
Hmm?

33:07.273 --> 33:09.649
It's not real, you know?

33:09.650 --> 33:12.369
You just use it to
exploit people.

33:12.370 --> 33:14.203
- You're wrong!

33:14.204 --> 33:17.884
You don't exist if
you're not online.

33:18.983 --> 33:20.432
Look at celebrities, yeah?

33:20.433 --> 33:23.451
The bigger they are, the
more followers they have.

33:23.452 --> 33:26.492
Followers, like a cult.

33:28.273 --> 33:32.058
Yeah, somewhere out there
there's the perfect clip.

33:32.059 --> 33:37.059
With the right drama,
humour, and excitement.

33:39.120 --> 33:40.714
I'll get a million hits.

33:46.405 --> 33:50.131
- Did you not get enough
attention at home, hmm?

33:50.139 --> 33:52.068
Is that why you moved out at 16?

33:52.069 --> 33:54.009
Or not enough from girls?

33:54.010 --> 33:55.875
Friends?

33:55.876 --> 33:57.636
Anyone?

33:59.956 --> 34:01.406
- No.

34:02.404 --> 34:04.942
- People who watch your
manipulated videos,

34:04.943 --> 34:06.520
they're not looking at you,

34:06.521 --> 34:08.460
they're looking at
Marc and Reese.

34:08.462 --> 34:10.596
They're not your friends.

34:12.078 --> 34:16.568
They watch 100
stupid videos a day!

34:16.569 --> 34:18.583
- I'm an artist!

34:18.583 --> 34:21.547
There's a difference between
what I do and some drugged

34:21.549 --> 34:23.362
up kid!

34:27.683 --> 34:31.121
Or how about that
video of the gymnast?

34:32.045 --> 34:34.230
Yeah, you must've seen it.

34:34.231 --> 34:39.231
Some pathetic girl exposes
herself to the internet.

34:40.524 --> 34:43.717
Add some slow-mo and some music,
and there's your million.

34:45.824 --> 34:50.277
She knew exactly
what she was doing.

34:52.065 --> 34:55.793
Pathetic little porn star.

34:55.795 --> 34:57.490
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

34:57.491 --> 34:59.266
Take it easy!

35:10.791 --> 35:13.575
- I thought you were
supposed to protect me.

35:15.015 --> 35:16.830
- I'm going to check on Dalton.

35:21.076 --> 35:22.717
- Through there,
upstairs, turn right.

35:22.718 --> 35:23.572
- What's that?

35:23.573 --> 35:24.936
- The investigation room.

35:24.937 --> 35:26.334
- Right.

35:57.596 --> 35:59.366
You need to cool off a bit.

35:59.367 --> 36:01.531
- Thank you, Detective.

36:01.532 --> 36:03.676
- You just attacked a witness!

36:06.136 --> 36:08.625
- He knew what he was doing.

36:08.626 --> 36:11.632
- Look, it wasn't him
who posted that video

36:11.633 --> 36:13.351
of your daughter.

36:15.633 --> 36:17.718
- You think I lost my temper?

36:18.727 --> 36:20.187
I'm in control.

36:20.188 --> 36:22.972
He wanted me to react, so I did.

36:24.272 --> 36:26.838
Let him think he's
getting to me.

36:28.507 --> 36:30.805
- How old is your daughter?

36:31.771 --> 36:33.280
- 14, why?

36:34.310 --> 36:37.071
- Balthazar is just
three years older.

36:37.072 --> 36:39.589
Until last night he thought
the whole thing was a joke.

36:41.584 --> 36:46.164
He's going through stages
of grief, ease up.

36:47.066 --> 36:49.346
You'll get more
answers that way.

36:49.347 --> 36:50.850
- The kid's not right.

36:50.851 --> 36:52.477
Look at that.

36:59.043 --> 37:01.004
- S-sorry to interrupt you,
but I've got something here

37:01.005 --> 37:02.220
you might want to see.

37:02.221 --> 37:03.170
- Yeah?

37:03.171 --> 37:06.967
- It's buried in his browser
history, suicide help sites.

37:06.968 --> 37:09.741
A forum he was posting
on last night.

37:10.807 --> 37:12.289
- Suicide websites.

37:12.290 --> 37:15.009
- Probably wanted to use
them for entertainment.

37:15.010 --> 37:17.058
- What if it's research?

37:26.828 --> 37:28.368
- Emerson!

37:30.603 --> 37:31.882
Where are you going?

37:31.883 --> 37:36.255
- I'm going to arrange legal
advice for Balthazar.

37:36.256 --> 37:37.621
I think he needs it.

37:37.622 --> 37:39.839
- Alright, okay!

37:39.840 --> 37:41.620
I'll take it easy.

37:41.621 --> 37:44.096
But you need to help
me get the truth!

38:00.020 --> 38:01.657
Okay, ready?

38:06.142 --> 38:09.608
Mr. and Mrs. Coulson, do
you know a boy called

38:09.609 --> 38:11.965
Reese Mattson?

38:11.966 --> 38:15.069
- I told her to
stay away from him!

38:15.070 --> 38:17.169
I thought she had.

38:17.170 --> 38:21.042
Julia humiliated herself at
a party a few weeks ago.

38:21.043 --> 38:23.303
Everyone saw it.

38:23.304 --> 38:25.820
That boy hated our family.

38:25.821 --> 38:30.588
He trashed my sister’s house,
broke my nephew's leg.

38:30.589 --> 38:33.766
- Our nephew Ty, he was
killed last night.

38:33.767 --> 38:35.324
Is Reese responsible?

38:35.325 --> 38:37.809
- No, we're not sure yet.

38:39.666 --> 38:42.736
Did you know that Reese and
Julia were still together?

38:42.737 --> 38:44.496
- That's impossible!

38:44.497 --> 38:46.416
- They were quite serious.

38:46.417 --> 38:50.415
- After that awful video came
out she started disappearing

38:50.416 --> 38:52.475
at all hours.

38:52.476 --> 38:55.055
I took her computer away.

38:55.056 --> 38:57.168
She didn't even mind.

38:57.169 --> 38:59.067
- Do you know where she went?

39:00.027 --> 39:03.025
Do you know anything that
would help us locate Reese?

39:14.231 --> 39:16.012
- You okay?

39:17.452 --> 39:19.082
- No parent deserves that.

39:22.316 --> 39:24.048
Excuse me.

39:25.334 --> 39:26.837
Can you give me a minute?

39:26.838 --> 39:28.437
I'll meet you downstairs.

39:28.438 --> 39:30.267
- I'll get you a coffee.
- Thanks.

39:35.734 --> 39:37.236
Doctor, doctor?

39:37.237 --> 39:37.856
- Yes?

39:37.857 --> 39:39.572
- Do you have those
tox reports yet?

39:39.573 --> 39:43.359
- Yes, we're running further
tests because the paracetamol

39:43.360 --> 39:44.617
just doesn't cover it.

39:44.618 --> 39:47.017
There was something
else in her system.

39:47.018 --> 39:49.876
She's stable for now so we're
in "wait and see" mode.

39:49.877 --> 39:53.395
- Right, I need them ASAP,
so just call me, soon as.

39:53.396 --> 39:54.858
- Alright.
- Thank you.

40:00.447 --> 40:02.883
- Do you think Reese
knows Julia's alive?

40:04.462 --> 40:06.552
- He probably doesn't even
know she hurt herself.

40:09.161 --> 40:11.011
You should focus on you.

40:13.842 --> 40:16.472
I'm sorry Dalton attacked you.

40:17.320 --> 40:19.085
- It's better than
being ignored.

40:20.882 --> 40:22.732
16 bottles of wine.

40:24.179 --> 40:25.799
- What?

40:25.800 --> 40:30.301
- Balthazar, that's
what I was named after.

40:33.095 --> 40:35.468
- Could've been one of
the three wise men.

40:40.604 --> 40:43.296
Some people just aren't
cut out to be parents.

40:45.286 --> 40:48.448
- Mine didn't even notice I'd
moved out for over a month.

40:49.564 --> 40:53.771
They were on a cruise
watching whales or penguins.

40:55.099 --> 40:57.589
- Perhaps you should've
tried to be more lovable.

41:00.080 --> 41:03.092
- My GP says I
have anger issues.

41:03.093 --> 41:04.857
And anxiety.

41:05.674 --> 41:08.523
Well, it's a long list.

41:08.524 --> 41:11.145
- Everyone has their share
SHIT to deal with, Balthazar.

41:11.146 --> 41:12.768
- Not everyone.

41:13.748 --> 41:16.468
Not Julia, not Reese.

41:16.469 --> 41:18.686
Those two have golden
horseshoes shoved up their

41:18.687 --> 41:20.766
perfect bottoms.

41:20.767 --> 41:23.716
- Trust me, everyone has.

41:25.481 --> 41:29.113
Though sometimes it's
buried very deep.

41:33.225 --> 41:35.352
- I didn't do anything.

41:36.606 --> 41:38.157
I just filmed.

41:40.041 --> 41:42.072
The videos help me escape.

41:43.966 --> 41:46.386
- The lure of the internet.

41:46.387 --> 41:49.981
- IT was my best
friend, 'til Reese.

41:55.848 --> 42:00.848
- You know, I've dabbled
in it, the internet.

42:02.354 --> 42:06.513
Online gambling, porn, box
sets from dubious sources,

42:06.514 --> 42:08.517
which is like porn.

42:08.518 --> 42:11.723
The law of diminishing returns.

42:14.257 --> 42:16.640
Thank goodness I
reigned myself in.

42:21.190 --> 42:23.861
I'm going to go check on Dalton.

42:26.288 --> 42:27.904
You want anything?

42:35.909 --> 42:37.460
Sergeant?

42:38.469 --> 42:41.455
Could you help me get hold of
Balthazar's doctor, please?

42:45.690 --> 42:48.862
- Can you locate Balthazar
William's GP for me?

42:50.074 --> 42:51.139
- Guv!

42:51.140 --> 42:52.718
No sign of cut grass
near the car park,

42:52.719 --> 42:54.531
but they did find this.

42:54.532 --> 42:56.813
- That look like it fell to you?

42:56.814 --> 42:58.381
- Smashed, more likely.

42:58.382 --> 43:00.002
- Good work.

43:00.003 --> 43:02.061
Okay, keep looking for Reese
and get that boy back

43:02.062 --> 43:03.277
in the interview room.

43:03.278 --> 43:04.627
- Yeah.

43:09.762 --> 43:10.339
- I need...

43:10.340 --> 43:12.193
- Tons of people, kids mostly,
been sending footage in.

43:12.194 --> 43:13.495
We've not get the man power
to go through all of it,

43:13.496 --> 43:14.540
but there is one Vine.

43:14.541 --> 43:16.099
- No, I need this fixed.

43:17.837 --> 43:19.159
Come on, you're good at this.

43:19.160 --> 43:21.138
- I've got to show
you this Vine.

43:25.666 --> 43:27.521
- Where's that image from?

43:27.522 --> 43:28.847
- Ty's phone.

43:28.848 --> 43:29.808
- When?

43:29.809 --> 43:31.768
- Yesterday, a few hours
before the deaths.

43:31.769 --> 43:34.542
- Can I get a print out of this?

43:34.543 --> 43:36.483
- I've got to show
you this Vine.

43:36.484 --> 43:37.950
- Okay, do.

43:40.623 --> 43:42.697
- Piss off
you videoing fuck!

43:45.465 --> 43:46.986
- Ready?
- Yeah.

43:46.987 --> 43:48.311
- Cool.

43:48.312 --> 43:51.434
You're into this world,
tell me what you think.

43:51.435 --> 43:54.975
- I mean, has he got
some odd posts? Yes.

43:54.976 --> 43:57.951
But, given the volume
of his YouTube channel,

43:57.952 --> 43:59.434
it's bound to happen.

43:59.435 --> 44:01.577
It's the way it works, you've
got to push the boundaries

44:01.578 --> 44:02.496
these days.

44:02.497 --> 44:05.129
These kids get all these clicks,
they become more popular,

44:05.130 --> 44:07.273
everybody likes a bit
of graphic content.

44:07.274 --> 44:08.852
Especially when they
see the warning.

44:08.853 --> 44:10.249
- Not everyone.

44:10.250 --> 44:11.829
- I do.

44:25.513 --> 44:26.962
- You ready to go again, then?

44:26.963 --> 44:28.194
- Yes.

44:29.490 --> 44:33.181
Alright, let's go back through
the CCTV, talk us through it.

44:35.133 --> 44:36.311
Exactly.

44:40.818 --> 44:44.215
That's Marc, that's
you, and there's Ty.

44:45.746 --> 44:49.126
- Yeah, um, Ty wanted to
know where Reese was.

44:49.127 --> 44:51.227
- Why was he late, where
did he come from?

44:51.228 --> 44:53.328
- He got married a
few hours earlier,

44:53.329 --> 44:55.201
he was meeting us.

44:55.202 --> 44:57.020
- Okay, sit down.

45:04.630 --> 45:06.160
What time?

45:09.921 --> 45:11.995
- Four in the afternoon.

45:13.505 --> 45:15.669
- Julia, can
you look this way please?

45:16.683 --> 45:17.838
That's lovely.

45:19.572 --> 45:20.901
- Thanks, mate.

45:20.902 --> 45:23.055
- So, where we going now?

45:23.056 --> 45:25.519
- I actually thought
it was just be us.

45:25.520 --> 45:27.461
Julia's parents are
gone for the afternoon.

45:27.462 --> 45:29.594
Wedding, ironically.

45:29.595 --> 45:31.439
- Oh, yeah, no.

45:31.440 --> 45:33.220
I figured it'd just be you two.

45:33.221 --> 45:34.340
- See you tonight?

45:34.341 --> 45:35.460
- Are you still coming?

45:35.461 --> 45:37.380
- Wouldn't miss
it for the world.

45:37.381 --> 45:38.918
- Thanks for today.

45:53.994 --> 45:55.657
- So Reese was the last
person to see Julia

45:55.658 --> 45:57.758
before her parents found her?

45:57.759 --> 46:00.979
- Don't know, guess so, yeah.

46:00.980 --> 46:02.670
- Hughie.

46:04.116 --> 46:06.270
- Reese tried to calm him down!

46:06.271 --> 46:08.922
It was all a terrible accident.

46:08.923 --> 46:12.276
Ty was devastated, he never
meant for it to happen.

46:15.386 --> 46:16.718
I wasn't fast enough.

46:16.719 --> 46:18.660
I found Reese outside
looking at Ty's body.

46:18.661 --> 46:20.100
Said he fell in the chase.

46:20.101 --> 46:21.945
Then we heard sirens and ran.

46:21.946 --> 46:23.705
That's when I dropped my
camera 'cause it was dark,

46:23.706 --> 46:26.159
then we couldn't find
the chip, did you?

46:29.401 --> 46:31.571
- Why was Ty waiting
there for you?

46:31.572 --> 46:32.733
- I told you before.

46:32.734 --> 46:36.253
- I got it, he was angry
because they got married.

46:36.254 --> 46:37.533
- How would you feel, yeah?

46:37.534 --> 46:39.634
If the guy you hated
married your cousin.

46:39.635 --> 46:41.918
- But how did he know
they were married?

46:47.454 --> 46:48.887
- Balthazar?

46:48.904 --> 46:51.143
- And how did he
know where you were?

46:51.144 --> 46:53.650
It's a random car park, not
the place you'd look for

46:53.651 --> 46:56.125
someone unless you
knew they were there.

46:58.589 --> 47:02.436
Someone sent Ty a photo
of the ceremony.

47:05.546 --> 47:09.032
Two lovers are in it, you were
the only one they invited.

47:09.033 --> 47:11.144
The only one they trusted.

47:11.145 --> 47:13.428
So who could've sent it?

47:15.732 --> 47:16.824
Hmm?

47:22.558 --> 47:23.816
- I did it for Reese.

47:26.984 --> 47:28.983
- You did it for Reese?

47:32.615 --> 47:36.594
- He was always falling in
love so easily, you know?

47:37.853 --> 47:40.243
And Julia, she was unhinged.

47:40.244 --> 47:42.259
I was doing it to protect him!

47:42.260 --> 47:44.723
You know, she was always
posting videos about how

47:44.724 --> 47:47.720
she didn't like guys or
didn't want a boyfriend.

47:47.721 --> 47:51.416
Check out her blog, two
months ago, the third.

47:56.158 --> 47:59.965
- Why do I always
overestimate some guys?

47:59.966 --> 48:01.799
And they significantly
underestimate me,

48:01.800 --> 48:03.037
and my friends an...

48:04.125 --> 48:06.120
- Stop!

48:07.144 --> 48:10.475
No more videos, just talking.

48:13.129 --> 48:15.933
- I was worried she'd
break up with him.

48:15.934 --> 48:18.525
That she'd do something crazy
to herself, and now...

48:18.526 --> 48:20.327
- So her overdose was
to get attention?

48:20.328 --> 48:22.429
- What more proof do you need?

48:23.773 --> 48:28.359
Look, I could tell she was
having those thoughts.

48:28.360 --> 48:30.167
I recognized them!

48:34.578 --> 48:36.444
I've had them.

48:38.044 --> 48:39.899
- Two minutes ago we saw
you trying to make videos

48:39.900 --> 48:42.416
with her and now you're
telling us she was suicidal.

48:42.417 --> 48:44.102
- She was internet gold.

48:44.103 --> 48:47.023
Pure, believable.

48:47.024 --> 48:50.684
People watched her, but she
became so obsessed with Reese.

48:51.857 --> 48:52.944
- You took their wedding video,

48:52.945 --> 48:54.042
you could've stopped it then.

48:54.043 --> 48:57.178
- I don't know, I didn't know
they were getting married!

48:57.179 --> 48:59.141
Reese just told me to be
there and bring my camera!

48:59.142 --> 49:01.858
It was all too late by then.

49:01.859 --> 49:04.599
Look, no one says no to Reese.

49:04.600 --> 49:06.316
- So you filmed it like
you film everything else?

49:06.317 --> 49:08.034
- It had gone too far!

49:08.035 --> 49:09.719
It was only 'til afterwards I
realized I could do something

49:09.720 --> 49:13.196
so, I just, I just sent
that picture to Ty!

49:13.197 --> 49:16.758
I thought he'd speak
to Julia's parents.

49:16.759 --> 49:19.938
They faked the consent so her
parents could just reverse it!

49:26.593 --> 49:28.769
- I think you planned
to stir things up.

49:28.770 --> 49:30.646
Ty's reaction to the
smoke was so good,

49:30.647 --> 49:32.074
it was such a hit!

49:32.075 --> 49:35.274
You wanted more, you wanted
a fight, you wanted drama!

49:35.275 --> 49:37.867
I think you might've planned all
of this from the beginning!

49:37.868 --> 49:39.648
Was it your suggestion
to have the party prank?

49:39.649 --> 49:42.134
- Reese needed my help!

49:43.467 --> 49:44.810
They were my friends!

49:44.811 --> 49:47.552
Marc was my friend
and now he's dead!

49:50.091 --> 49:51.454
What was I supposed to do?

49:51.455 --> 49:55.667
Look, Reese chased after
Ty after he killed Marc.

49:55.668 --> 49:58.205
I didn't know that was
going to happen, did I?

49:58.206 --> 50:00.786
- All you do is
record you friends.

50:00.787 --> 50:03.250
You barely talk to them, you
barely interact with them!

50:03.251 --> 50:06.513
- Inspector Dalton, that's
enough, Balthazar's helping.

50:06.514 --> 50:08.764
- They wanted me to record them!

50:08.765 --> 50:10.332
They told me to!

50:10.333 --> 50:13.117
- I mean it, Hetty, no more.

50:35.409 --> 50:37.369
- We found the SD card.

50:37.370 --> 50:39.225
- Whoa.
- What?

50:39.226 --> 50:40.622
- Put it on.

50:40.623 --> 50:42.153
- I don't think...

51:01.977 --> 51:03.479
- How?

51:03.480 --> 51:06.211
- I'd say telescopic
camera pole.

51:09.432 --> 51:11.800
- You're just a freak with
a camera, aren't you?

51:12.781 --> 51:15.170
Positioning people to
get the best clip.

51:24.834 --> 51:26.539
- I didn't want to.

51:26.540 --> 51:28.550
- Who made you?

51:39.564 --> 51:40.906
- It wasn't my choice.

51:40.907 --> 51:42.597
- So who's pulling the strings?

51:49.003 --> 51:49.984
- Reese did.

51:49.985 --> 51:52.064
- What was that? Speak up!

51:53.781 --> 51:55.627
- Reese told me to do it.

51:57.472 --> 51:59.776
- What else did Reese
make you record?

52:02.943 --> 52:05.460
Come on, now is not the time
to be holding your tongue.

52:05.461 --> 52:06.494
- No, he...

52:06.495 --> 52:08.201
- Don't defend your
friend either.

52:08.202 --> 52:11.178
- Balthazar, just tell the
truth, you'll be okay.

52:12.799 --> 52:14.393
- I need a break.

52:17.204 --> 52:21.614
- The more I look at
Reese the worse he gets.

52:23.102 --> 52:24.419
Hughie.

52:26.003 --> 52:27.832
- Piss off you videoing fuck!

52:30.526 --> 52:32.536
Piss off you videoing fuck!

52:43.512 --> 52:44.903
- You okay?

52:50.648 --> 52:52.176
- Thank you.

52:52.177 --> 52:55.278
Reese has been spotted at a
pharmacy near Julia's house.

52:56.405 --> 52:58.004
We will find him.

52:58.005 --> 53:00.655
Now's the time for you
to tell the truth.

53:02.580 --> 53:05.907
There's a curious thing
about Julia's overdose.

53:05.908 --> 53:08.746
It doesn't appear to
be self-inflicted.

53:17.039 --> 53:19.528
The doctor's say there was
a substance in her system,

53:19.529 --> 53:22.061
but we couldn't find
it in her room.

53:23.091 --> 53:26.834
After he slept with her, he
drugged her, then he met you,

53:26.835 --> 53:28.344
and killed Ty.

53:29.534 --> 53:31.708
This footage was
caught this afternoon.

53:31.709 --> 53:34.108
Reese seems to have a
vendetta against this family.

53:34.109 --> 53:37.276
We need to catch him before
he hurts anyone else.

53:38.792 --> 53:40.791
Tell us what you
know, Balthazar.

53:43.378 --> 53:45.132
- Take a breath.

53:45.146 --> 53:46.548
- Tell us.

53:57.082 --> 53:58.451
- Okay.

54:02.479 --> 54:04.072
Okay, you're right.

54:09.166 --> 54:10.632
I was scared of him.

54:13.443 --> 54:16.119
Whenever I said no to
something he wanted,

54:16.120 --> 54:17.959
he threatened me.

54:27.448 --> 54:30.247
It was like there was
two sides to him.

54:36.076 --> 54:37.596
I didn't think anyone
would believe me

54:38.818 --> 54:40.454
'cause people like him so much.

54:47.905 --> 54:50.011
I was lucky to be his friend.

54:54.145 --> 54:55.931
- He exploited you.

54:58.966 --> 55:00.410
- Go on.

55:08.618 --> 55:11.492
- He killed someone
in front of me.

55:16.565 --> 55:18.734
And I haven't got
anyone to go to.

55:28.884 --> 55:30.808
- I think he's dead.

55:33.001 --> 55:34.942
- What?

55:38.856 --> 55:40.290
It was an accident.

55:42.302 --> 55:43.736
I swear.

55:45.885 --> 55:47.143
- You killed him.

55:47.144 --> 55:49.271
- No, no, no!

55:50.706 --> 55:52.924
No!

56:01.446 --> 56:04.038
- Reese
knew what he was doing.

56:04.039 --> 56:05.520
- Give me the card.

56:05.521 --> 56:07.441
- He knew the
camera could prove it.

56:08.679 --> 56:10.202
- I couldn't stop him.

56:29.206 --> 56:31.897
- We better get our
story straight.

56:40.356 --> 56:45.356
- He killed Ty, but I had
no idea about Julia.

56:48.537 --> 56:50.526
I honestly thought he loved her.

56:53.720 --> 56:55.624
I thought he was my friend.

57:01.294 --> 57:04.029
Can I go home now, please?

57:07.171 --> 57:08.669
- Can I have a word?

57:10.839 --> 57:12.049
- Yeah.

57:34.838 --> 57:36.486
- That boy's had enough.

57:37.515 --> 57:40.512
You've got the CCTV and his
testimony, now let him go.

57:40.513 --> 57:41.813
- Look, I know he's
had a rough time,

57:41.814 --> 57:43.871
but not before we're finished.

57:43.872 --> 57:46.431
- Balthazar has serious
anxiety issues,

57:46.432 --> 57:48.490
as well as numerous
other conditions.

57:48.491 --> 57:50.293
- He told me he had
no medical issues.

57:50.294 --> 57:51.892
- Well he lied.

57:51.893 --> 57:54.687
Now, you keep on pressing
him, his testimony will be

57:54.688 --> 57:55.967
inadmissible.

57:55.968 --> 57:57.056
- Shit!

57:58.591 --> 58:00.660
This is your fault, you
were supposed to sort this!

58:00.661 --> 58:02.713
- I didn't attack him!

58:04.436 --> 58:06.857
- Next time I'll get a
more appropriate adult.

58:06.858 --> 58:08.362
Is he still on medication?

58:09.961 --> 58:11.888
- He'll be on a
cocktail for life.

58:11.889 --> 58:13.461
Let him go.

58:23.045 --> 58:24.383
- Christ!

58:34.213 --> 58:36.953
Yes, hello, this is
Detective Inspector Dalton.

58:38.010 --> 58:38.938
Yes.

58:38.939 --> 58:41.358
Listen, I need you to check
Julia Coulson's system

58:41.359 --> 58:42.712
for a specific substance.

58:42.713 --> 58:47.713
Something like an anti-anxiety
drug or an anti-depressant.

58:48.120 --> 58:49.539
Yes.

58:49.540 --> 58:52.610
Great, thank you, can you
get straight back to me?

58:52.611 --> 58:53.773
Great.

58:53.774 --> 58:55.159
- Ma'am?

58:55.160 --> 58:56.099
- Hmm?

58:56.100 --> 58:58.477
- Balthazar posted about
Lorazepam on one of those

58:58.478 --> 58:59.938
suicide sites, just last night.

58:59.939 --> 59:01.932
He asked how much would be
fatal and how much would

59:01.933 --> 59:04.077
put someone into a coma.

59:08.785 --> 59:10.172
- You're free to go.

59:15.565 --> 59:18.896
- Interview concluded at 1952.

59:28.023 --> 59:29.803
Keep videoing, mate.

59:29.804 --> 59:31.776
Next time you should
do one with your cat.

59:31.777 --> 59:34.053
- Everyone loves a
kitty on a Hoover.

59:37.163 --> 59:38.928
You going to be alright?

59:39.680 --> 59:42.122
We have a number of
programs and people

59:42.123 --> 59:43.797
that can help, we
have youth support...

59:43.798 --> 59:45.345
- Thanks.

59:45.346 --> 59:47.111
For getting me out of here.

59:48.343 --> 59:49.735
- You're welcome.

59:51.383 --> 59:53.282
- How is she?
- Julia?

59:55.063 --> 59:57.256
I hear she's slowly coming
around, silly girl.

59:57.257 --> 59:58.217
- And Reese?

59:58.218 --> 59:59.433
- Still out there.

59:59.434 --> 01:00:01.289
Remember, he's not
a friend of yours.

01:00:01.290 --> 01:00:03.049
- No, he might do
something stupid.

01:00:04.351 --> 01:00:05.630
I need to get to him.

01:00:05.631 --> 01:00:07.001
- Balthazar.

01:00:08.052 --> 01:00:12.691
You need to stop recording
and start participating.

01:00:12.692 --> 01:00:16.504
- I'm on the verge of making a
video the world will watch.

01:00:17.449 --> 01:00:18.909
Remember to share.

01:00:30.472 --> 01:00:32.252
When can I get my equipment?

01:00:32.253 --> 01:00:34.402
- When we're finished with it.

01:00:56.912 --> 01:00:58.928
- Oh, hi, yeah, can I
order some flowers for

01:00:58.929 --> 01:01:01.158
Julia Coulson, please?

01:01:01.159 --> 01:01:03.723
Yeah, can you let me
know her room number?

01:01:06.471 --> 01:01:09.547
Online ordering,
internet never sleeps.

01:01:12.113 --> 01:01:13.589
Great, thanks.

01:01:30.992 --> 01:01:32.628
- Careful, take your time.

01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:36.223
Yeah, just get it
around the borders.

01:01:43.177 --> 01:01:44.814
That's it, keep it up.

01:01:45.918 --> 01:01:47.971
- Yes, what is he up to?

01:01:48.765 --> 01:01:49.938
Really?

01:01:49.939 --> 01:01:51.469
Okay, we're on our way.

01:02:14.049 --> 01:02:15.760
Where is she?

01:02:40.213 --> 01:02:41.646
- See you in a bit.

01:03:57.104 --> 01:03:58.516
- I'm so sorry.

01:04:00.431 --> 01:04:01.876
- She's fine, yeah?

01:04:06.522 --> 01:04:09.160
- They're keeping her
alive for her organs.

01:04:10.670 --> 01:04:12.734
I heard the doctors
saying it earlier.

01:04:30.264 --> 01:04:31.890
- She looks so real.

01:04:36.021 --> 01:04:38.367
- Too bad you
destroyed the card.

01:04:39.701 --> 01:04:41.822
Would've proved you innocent.

01:04:41.823 --> 01:04:44.025
- Two people died.

01:04:44.981 --> 01:04:46.831
Doesn't that mean
anything to you?

01:04:48.095 --> 01:04:49.828
I think you killed him.

01:04:51.082 --> 01:04:52.451
- What?

01:04:57.961 --> 01:04:59.406
- He's dead.

01:05:08.830 --> 01:05:10.616
- It was an accident.

01:05:16.392 --> 01:05:18.061
So sorry, Reese.

01:05:19.645 --> 01:05:22.386
I... I didn't mean it,
I didn't mean it!

01:05:25.255 --> 01:05:27.852
I can't go to prison, I can't.

01:05:30.066 --> 01:05:31.393
- Yeah.

01:05:33.084 --> 01:05:35.830
Ty, no.

01:05:43.505 --> 01:05:45.180
- I'm not a murderer.

01:05:46.342 --> 01:05:47.499
Ty!

01:06:26.404 --> 01:06:28.456
What are you doing?

01:06:30.041 --> 01:06:31.677
- This is...

01:06:35.523 --> 01:06:37.394
- Why didn't you help?

01:06:41.325 --> 01:06:43.015
- This is the million.

01:06:48.706 --> 01:06:50.535
- Give me the card.

01:06:51.863 --> 01:06:53.425
- What?

01:06:53.426 --> 01:06:55.165
The Holy Grail?

01:06:57.266 --> 01:06:58.534
- You can't post it!

01:06:58.535 --> 01:07:00.385
- But it's my footage!

01:07:05.255 --> 01:07:07.179
- You're sick in the head.

01:07:28.229 --> 01:07:30.399
- You're right.

01:07:35.429 --> 01:07:36.820
I'm sorry.

01:07:42.490 --> 01:07:44.292
- I need to go to the police.

01:07:45.682 --> 01:07:48.121
- Your fingerprints
are all over him.

01:07:48.122 --> 01:07:50.626
They'll find out you
hated each other.

01:07:50.627 --> 01:07:52.367
You'll be arrested.

01:07:54.884 --> 01:07:56.702
I'm the only one who
can clear your name.

01:07:57.732 --> 01:07:59.219
I can back you up.

01:08:00.387 --> 01:08:02.545
I saw it all, Reese.

01:08:02.546 --> 01:08:04.667
I can tell the police.

01:08:04.668 --> 01:08:06.951
I'll tell Julia the truth.

01:08:08.391 --> 01:08:09.700
- Julia.

01:08:21.673 --> 01:08:24.024
- You're doing alright,
you're doing alright.

01:08:29.428 --> 01:08:30.723
Yeah, cool.

01:08:40.029 --> 01:08:41.310
It works!

01:08:41.310 --> 01:08:42.884
It bloody works!

01:08:52.937 --> 01:08:54.578
- Yes, Dalton.

01:08:55.658 --> 01:08:58.468
Okay, yeah, thank you doctor.

01:08:59.837 --> 01:09:02.221
There was Lorazapam
in her system, hurry.

01:09:15.314 --> 01:09:16.733
- Where's Dalton?

01:09:16.734 --> 01:09:18.291
- No idea.

01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:24.738
- It's from the broken SD card.

01:09:29.265 --> 01:09:30.743
- Ty!

01:09:31.890 --> 01:09:33.462
- Ty jumped!
- Yeah.

01:09:38.631 --> 01:09:40.481
- Why didn't you help?

01:09:42.908 --> 01:09:44.865
- She was right.

01:09:47.131 --> 01:09:48.725
- Hughie?

01:09:49.649 --> 01:09:51.840
He jumped? No.

01:10:06.768 --> 01:10:08.202
- Reese.

01:10:09.946 --> 01:10:11.562
It's time to let go.

01:10:25.689 --> 01:10:27.784
- Forgive me, Julia.

01:10:36.953 --> 01:10:41.757
- If it wasn't for you,
she'd still be alive.

01:10:44.152 --> 01:10:45.890
- It's your stupid stunts!

01:10:45.891 --> 01:10:47.543
That's why this happened,
why any of it happened!

01:10:47.544 --> 01:10:48.727
- You wanted to be
in these videos!

01:10:48.728 --> 01:10:50.028
- No, you begged me
to do that shit.

01:10:50.029 --> 01:10:51.996
I never went looking for you!

01:11:01.783 --> 01:11:03.398
We took our vows.

01:11:06.348 --> 01:11:08.593
'Til death do us part.

01:11:31.467 --> 01:11:34.692
Here's to you, my love.

01:12:39.868 --> 01:12:41.286
- Hugh, mate?
- Yes?

01:12:59.191 --> 01:13:00.532
No.

01:13:48.073 --> 01:13:49.966
- Hugh, come look at this.

01:13:53.172 --> 01:13:56.594
This is delayed, this
is not a live feed.

01:13:56.595 --> 01:13:58.041
There's a delay.

01:13:58.042 --> 01:13:59.108
- That's two.

01:13:59.109 --> 01:14:00.985
- Leave it with me,
I can do this.

01:14:00.986 --> 01:14:02.899
Two minutes.

01:14:07.663 --> 01:14:08.916
- Come on!

01:14:12.825 --> 01:14:15.525
Try and find every server
within a mile of his address.

01:14:15.526 --> 01:14:17.173
Shit, I knew it!

01:14:21.126 --> 01:14:22.543
- Where are the people
that we left on guard

01:14:22.544 --> 01:14:24.165
outside her room?

01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:26.913
Okay, we have to kill that feed!

01:14:26.914 --> 01:14:28.497
Do you understand?

01:14:29.953 --> 01:14:31.790
Christ, faster.

01:14:49.279 --> 01:14:50.744
- Reese?

01:14:51.699 --> 01:14:52.942
Reese?

01:15:04.830 --> 01:15:07.181
P-please wake up.

01:15:12.092 --> 01:15:13.559
Please wake up!

01:15:18.492 --> 01:15:20.460
Oh God.

01:15:23.346 --> 01:15:24.662
Please!

01:15:28.711 --> 01:15:30.635
Reese? Reese?

01:15:34.011 --> 01:15:36.021
Why won't you wake up?

01:15:41.577 --> 01:15:42.745
Oh!

01:15:43.872 --> 01:15:45.263
Oh, God!

01:15:48.010 --> 01:15:49.903
Oh, God, please!

01:16:04.350 --> 01:16:06.205
- How are we doing downstairs?

01:16:06.206 --> 01:16:09.469
We don't have five minutes,
we don't even have two!

01:16:09.470 --> 01:16:10.792
- Can you try and
help us out, people?

01:16:10.793 --> 01:16:12.072
We're really
struggling, thank you,

01:16:12.073 --> 01:16:13.223
as quickly as possible.

01:16:13.224 --> 01:16:15.369
- Make it half that, cheers.

01:16:15.370 --> 01:16:16.126
How are we doing?

01:16:16.127 --> 01:16:17.309
- Police are
on their way, Hugh!

01:16:17.310 --> 01:16:18.710
- Take
that down, then.

01:18:09.185 --> 01:18:10.758
- I can't watch it.

01:19:33.809 --> 01:19:35.483
- Julia!

01:19:35.484 --> 01:19:37.339
Julia, wake up!

01:19:37.340 --> 01:19:41.104
Julia, open the door!

01:19:41.105 --> 01:19:43.142
Get this open!

01:19:44.443 --> 01:19:45.856
- Out of the way!

01:20:01.508 --> 01:20:02.980
Film me!

01:20:06.543 --> 01:20:07.982
You all watched?

01:20:07.983 --> 01:20:12.665
Yeah, well now it's your
time to redeem yourselves.

01:20:12.666 --> 01:20:14.195
This boy.

01:20:15.801 --> 01:20:18.888
This boy, Balthazar, find him!

01:20:36.077 --> 01:20:39.362
- O'Rourke, get a
move on, come on!

01:20:47.639 --> 01:20:51.929
He said somewhere in
Borough, near the market.

01:20:51.930 --> 01:20:53.822
Hughie's trying to pinpoint him.

01:21:03.374 --> 01:21:04.925
Is that him?

01:21:18.211 --> 01:21:20.124
Shit, you can get
around the back.

01:21:42.625 --> 01:21:43.989
There, there!

01:21:58.144 --> 01:21:59.695
- Balthazar, stop!

01:22:01.525 --> 01:22:02.821
Stop.

01:22:05.024 --> 01:22:06.574
Balthazar.

01:22:09.386 --> 01:22:10.780
Balthazar.

01:22:18.098 --> 01:22:19.628
- Are you filming it?

01:22:21.063 --> 01:22:22.508
- Stop it.

01:22:23.623 --> 01:22:24.763
- I can't believe it's him.

01:22:24.764 --> 01:22:26.343
- Stop filming!

01:22:27.399 --> 01:22:29.291
- Just take it easy.

01:22:32.444 --> 01:22:36.080
- See, how do you like it, huh?

01:22:38.182 --> 01:22:39.845
- Balthazar, come on.

01:22:39.846 --> 01:22:41.904
Just tell me what happened.

01:22:45.627 --> 01:22:47.263
- He owed me!

01:22:49.072 --> 01:22:52.613
I had two deaths on camera
and Reese destroyed them!

01:22:54.192 --> 01:22:57.172
- For what, a million
hits guaranteed?

01:22:59.663 --> 01:23:01.310
- He replaced me!

01:23:02.778 --> 01:23:04.606
Stop filming me, please!

01:23:05.913 --> 01:23:07.230
Stop it!

01:23:08.153 --> 01:23:09.219
- Come on.

01:23:09.220 --> 01:23:12.056
It's alright, come on,
you stop this now,

01:23:12.057 --> 01:23:13.886
it doesn't go on the news.

01:23:24.494 --> 01:23:26.540
- Film this!

01:23:26.541 --> 01:23:27.783
- No.

01:23:30.221 --> 01:23:31.778
- Get off me!

01:24:29.268 --> 01:24:31.321
- I know the truth.

01:24:32.596 --> 01:24:37.539
Balthazar told me what
happened to Marc and Ty.

01:24:42.889 --> 01:24:44.461
I'm here for you.

01:24:46.227 --> 01:24:48.120
You must be so scared.

01:24:53.768 --> 01:24:55.223
But I love you.

01:25:01.213 --> 01:25:04.556
Um, we'll get through
this together.

01:25:06.087 --> 01:25:09.356
Our connection, that's
what's important.

01:25:11.388 --> 01:25:14.102
Not what people post or watch.

01:25:17.948 --> 01:25:20.342
If we're together we'll be okay.

01:25:24.508 --> 01:25:28.757
Um, I'll meet you tomorrow
under the bridge.

01:25:30.491 --> 01:25:34.543
We can go to the police
together, or run away,

01:25:34.544 --> 01:25:36.074
whatever you want.

01:25:38.789 --> 01:25:40.277
We'll be okay.

01:25:45.168 --> 01:25:46.740
I love you.

01:25:48.645 --> 01:25:50.260
It's real.

01:25:51.791 --> 01:25:53.833
Nothing else matters.

01:26:00.111 --> 01:26:01.894
You're sure he's okay?

01:26:01.895 --> 01:26:05.575
- Promise, I'll get
this to him now.

01:26:07.419 --> 01:26:08.677
- Maybe I should go with you.

01:26:08.678 --> 01:26:11.633
- You pack, I'll
be faster alone.

01:26:13.617 --> 01:26:14.997
- Thanks, Bal.

01:26:16.561 --> 01:26:19.392
- Here, take this.

01:26:20.624 --> 01:26:23.141
Should stop you from crashing.

01:26:23.142 --> 01:26:25.290
They're waker-uppers.

01:26:26.405 --> 01:26:28.506
You don't want to miss Reese.

01:26:28.507 --> 01:26:31.001
- I'm so worried,
I'll never sleep.

01:26:31.002 --> 01:26:33.151
- It's not worth risking it.

01:26:35.738 --> 01:26:37.929
They're really mild, trust me.

01:27:31.105 --> 01:27:32.337
Bal?

01:27:34.603 --> 01:27:36.208
Bal, I um...

01:27:40.758 --> 01:27:42.096
Bal?

01:27:45.120 --> 01:27:46.559
Bal?

01:27:59.221 --> 01:28:00.584
- That's one.
