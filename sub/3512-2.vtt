00:00.483 --> 00:01.611
<i>Previously on "Castle"... </i>

00:01.771 --> 00:03.286
Oh, my God. You're proposing!

00:03.448 --> 00:04.584
Okay. You're surprised.

00:04.919 --> 00:06.520
- I got the job.
- In D.C.?

00:07.157 --> 00:09.433
- Is this your case? What's it about?
- It's classified.

00:09.939 --> 00:12.165
- Someone gained access to Cybertech's clean room...
- (Beeps)

00:12.233 --> 00:15.368
And stole a highly classified
hardware security module.

00:15.436 --> 00:16.903
What do we know about our thieves?

00:16.971 --> 00:18.538
- (Richmond) Jack Bronson, 35.
- (Key clicks, computer beeps)

00:18.605 --> 00:20.407
Recently retired marine force recon.

00:20.474 --> 00:21.674
We're gonna walk over to my car together,

00:21.742 --> 00:23.042
and you're gonna get in like you know me.

00:23.109 --> 00:24.944
You were at the golf course with the feds.

00:25.011 --> 00:27.779
(Grunting) Did they... say
anything about Valkyrie?

00:27.847 --> 00:29.614
Hey, man, are you okay? (Grunting)

00:29.682 --> 00:33.218
Going... to Dream... World.

00:33.286 --> 00:35.487
(Tires screech)

00:35.555 --> 00:38.290
Valkyrie? What's Valkyrie?

00:38.358 --> 00:39.590
I don't know about "Valkyrie,"

00:39.658 --> 00:40.925
but "Dreamworld"...

00:40.993 --> 00:43.561
it's a highly classified special
operations base in the Gulf.

00:43.628 --> 00:46.331
Beckett's into something
way bigger than she realizes.

00:46.398 --> 00:49.733
You don't understand.
Jack was being set up.

00:49.801 --> 00:51.202
It turns out that something else was stolen

00:51.270 --> 00:53.371
from another lab in that building.

00:53.439 --> 00:56.373
It was a chemical agent.

00:56.441 --> 01:00.377
That toxin was used to kill Jack Bronson.

01:00.445 --> 01:03.546
It was placed in the
ventilation system of his car.

01:03.614 --> 01:05.114
I was in that car.

01:05.183 --> 01:07.017
Based on the amount found
in your blood stream,

01:07.085 --> 01:09.719
you have less than a day to live.

01:09.787 --> 01:12.321
What about an antidote?
There has to be an antidote.

01:12.479 --> 01:15.914
The only existing vial
was stolen with the toxin.

01:15.982 --> 01:17.283
They can make more, right?

01:17.350 --> 01:18.617
They have to be able to make more.

01:18.685 --> 01:20.152
It would take too long to synthesize.

01:20.220 --> 01:21.487
How long? A week.

01:21.555 --> 01:23.322
That's too long.

01:24.924 --> 01:26.525
Are you sure I was exposed? I mean, I...

01:26.593 --> 01:30.628
I feel fine. Maybe they were... wrong.

01:32.198 --> 01:34.199
Look, there's a doctor
coming in from Walter Reed.

01:34.266 --> 01:37.635
He's gonna be able to answer any
other questions that you might have.

01:37.703 --> 01:39.270
Yeah, well, I think you already did that.

01:39.338 --> 01:41.172
Hey.

01:42.941 --> 01:44.341
We're gonna find whoever's behind this.

01:44.409 --> 01:45.976
And when we do, we're
gonna get that antidote,

01:46.043 --> 01:49.580
'cause I'm not letting you out
of our engagement that easily.

01:49.772 --> 01:52.674
(Exhales) All right.

01:52.742 --> 01:55.344
So where are you in the investigation?

01:55.411 --> 01:57.812
We're looking into every possible lead.

01:57.880 --> 02:00.715
That's what you say when you're nowhere.

02:00.782 --> 02:01.815
Castle...

02:01.883 --> 02:03.317
The guy who abducted me...

02:03.385 --> 02:04.885
- Yeah. Bronson.
- Right.

02:04.953 --> 02:07.388
Was he military? Special ops?

02:07.456 --> 02:09.323
Marine force recon. Why?

02:09.390 --> 02:11.525
Okay, because before he
died, he said something.

02:11.593 --> 02:13.694
Valkyrie. Yeah. We've been looking into it.

02:13.762 --> 02:16.363
- There's nothing in the databases.
- Not that.

02:16.430 --> 02:18.231
He said something about Dreamworld.

02:18.299 --> 02:19.866
Now I didn't think it was anything,

02:19.933 --> 02:21.934
but according to Esposito,

02:22.002 --> 02:24.971
"Dreamworld" is the code name
of a special ops ghost base

02:25.038 --> 02:26.273
somewhere in the Middle East.

02:26.340 --> 02:27.440
And you think that that somehow relates

02:27.508 --> 02:29.075
to the theft of the toxin?

02:29.143 --> 02:31.877
I... think Bronson thought it did.

02:31.944 --> 02:33.379
(Knock on door)

02:34.781 --> 02:36.114
Sorry to interrupt.

02:36.182 --> 02:38.651
I'm Dr. Goldberg, here
to check on Mr. Castle.

02:40.000 --> 02:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:47.959 --> 02:49.694
How's he doing?

02:49.762 --> 02:51.729
Better than I am. Where are we?

02:51.797 --> 02:53.130
Well, we know whoever's behind this

02:53.198 --> 02:54.532
framed Jack Bronson for the break-in

02:54.600 --> 02:56.033
and then used the toxin to kill him.

02:56.101 --> 02:58.202
Which means they would have had
to have crossed paths with him

02:58.270 --> 03:00.438
- in order to deliver it.
- Exactly.

03:00.506 --> 03:02.139
Hendricks and his team are retracing

03:02.207 --> 03:04.541
all of Bronson's movements
to get a who and a when.

03:04.609 --> 03:07.277
It's a needle in a haystack,
but maybe we'll get lucky.

03:07.345 --> 03:09.646
- Anything on Valkyrie?
- Nothing that connects.

03:09.714 --> 03:12.516
Analysts are still working on it, though.

03:12.583 --> 03:15.719
Have you ever heard of
something called Dreamworld?

03:15.787 --> 03:17.621
What's Dreamworld?

03:17.689 --> 03:19.589
The pralidoxime and atropine

03:19.657 --> 03:22.292
will stave off the effect of the toxin

03:22.359 --> 03:24.360
and buy you some more time.

03:24.428 --> 03:25.528
(Syringe clacks on table)

03:25.595 --> 03:27.130
How much more?

03:27.198 --> 03:29.299
An hour, maybe two.

03:29.366 --> 03:31.400
I'll give you another
shot every four hours,

03:31.468 --> 03:35.571
but eventually it won't be effective.

03:35.639 --> 03:37.806
And then what?

03:37.874 --> 03:39.441
(Tape rips)

03:39.508 --> 03:41.977
Towards the end, you'll start to feel weak,

03:42.045 --> 03:43.645
experience shortness of breath.

03:44.981 --> 03:47.449
Why did Bronson die so
quickly, and I'm still alive?

03:47.516 --> 03:48.683
Bronson was in the car for hours,

03:48.751 --> 03:50.485
so he got the mother lode.

03:50.553 --> 03:53.020
You were in the car just for a few minutes.

03:53.088 --> 03:54.989
Ingested in liquid form,
you go down in seconds,

03:55.057 --> 03:57.524
but based on your blood work,

03:57.592 --> 03:59.560
you have at least another 10 to 12 hours.

04:00.896 --> 04:03.364
- (Gloves snap)
- So then...

04:03.431 --> 04:07.501
apart from the fact
that I'm dying, I'm fine?

04:07.569 --> 04:09.970
You're asymptomatic.

04:10.037 --> 04:12.605
I'll try to keep you that
way for as long as possible.

04:15.676 --> 04:18.111
A ghost base in the Middle East?

04:18.178 --> 04:19.745
Look, I know this is a long shot,

04:19.813 --> 04:21.982
but Bronson may have been
trying to communicate a message.

04:22.048 --> 04:23.949
Or it's just the ramblings of a dying man.

04:24.017 --> 04:25.550
Look, we checked the government

04:25.618 --> 04:27.119
and military databases.

04:27.187 --> 04:28.954
There's no official
reference to Dreamworld...

04:29.022 --> 04:30.289
if it even exists.

04:30.357 --> 04:31.757
Uh, I think it exists.

04:31.824 --> 04:33.092
What did you find?

04:33.159 --> 04:35.294
A name just popped in a Pentagon archive.

04:35.362 --> 04:38.163
Brad Parker, a reporter
for "The Washington Union."

04:38.231 --> 04:40.464
(Typing) (Villante) What's a
reporter got to do with this?

04:40.532 --> 04:42.267
Six months ago he tried
to publish an article

04:42.334 --> 04:44.702
called "inside Dreamworld,"

04:44.770 --> 04:48.606
but it was quashed over
national security concerns.

04:48.673 --> 04:50.141
What does the article say?

04:50.209 --> 04:52.043
I don't have the text.
They've classified it.

04:52.111 --> 04:53.311
I have the title.

04:53.379 --> 04:55.113
I'll call my contact at the Pentagon

04:55.180 --> 04:56.513
and see what he can dig up.

04:56.580 --> 04:58.448
In the meanwhile, track down this reporter.

04:58.516 --> 04:59.783
Find out what he knows.

04:59.850 --> 05:01.818
You could also check
Bronson's phone records.

05:01.886 --> 05:03.787
He and this reporter might be connected.

05:03.854 --> 05:05.389
Castle, you should be resting.

05:05.456 --> 05:07.391
There's plenty of time for
that later... apparently.

05:07.458 --> 05:09.393
Um, if it's all the same,
I'd rather be helping.

05:09.460 --> 05:12.362
Mr. Castle, I understand your
desire to be involved, but...

05:12.430 --> 05:14.631
No one is more motivated
than me to solve this,

05:14.698 --> 05:16.098
and if it doesn't work out,

05:16.166 --> 05:18.601
I'll... be out of your
hair by the end of the day.

05:18.669 --> 05:20.603
Y... you know, sir, Castle is the only one

05:20.671 --> 05:22.639
that has firsthand experience with Bronson.

05:22.706 --> 05:23.807
He might be an asset.

05:27.177 --> 05:29.010
Okay.

05:29.078 --> 05:31.012
But, Agent Beckett,
he's your responsibility.

05:31.080 --> 05:32.848
- I know.
- (Computer beeps)

05:32.916 --> 05:35.784
<i>Sir, it looks like Bronson
and the reporter are connected.</i>

05:35.852 --> 05:37.820
His phone records show calls to and from

05:37.887 --> 05:39.254
"The Washington Union"

05:39.322 --> 05:40.689
around the time the article was written.

05:40.757 --> 05:42.858
Bronson must have been
a source for the article.

05:42.926 --> 05:45.460
Go. Find out what he knows.

05:45.527 --> 05:47.094
Uh, Mr. Castle.

05:47.162 --> 05:49.764
You can assist us, but only
from inside this building.

05:49.832 --> 05:51.332
Right. Mm.

06:05.480 --> 06:09.382
Look, uh, thanks for
backing me up with Castle.

06:09.450 --> 06:10.917
Was he always such a character?

06:10.985 --> 06:14.488
Yeah. It's one of the things
that I love about him, too.

06:14.555 --> 06:15.455
(Door opens)

06:17.191 --> 06:18.557
There.

06:20.127 --> 06:21.260
Mr. Parker!

06:21.178 --> 06:23.313
(Car doors close) Mr. Parker, excuse me.

06:23.380 --> 06:24.948
We're from the Attorney General's office.

06:25.015 --> 06:26.316
We need to ask you a few questions

06:26.383 --> 06:29.052
about an article you
wrote... "Inside Dreamworld."

06:29.269 --> 06:31.270
Really? We're gonna do this again?

06:31.338 --> 06:32.905
You people are unbelievable.

06:32.973 --> 06:34.473
Excuse me?

06:34.540 --> 06:36.208
I wouldn't give up my sources
when you killed the article,

06:36.275 --> 06:38.076
why would I give them up now?

06:38.144 --> 06:40.612
Because it looks like one
of your sources was murdered.

06:40.646 --> 06:42.447
Do you recognize him, Mr. Parker?

06:44.417 --> 06:46.551
Bronson.

06:46.619 --> 06:48.387
He was murdered?

06:48.454 --> 06:51.890
Yes, and now other
people's lives are at stake.

06:51.957 --> 06:54.859
Now tell us everything
you know about Dreamworld.

07:02.390 --> 07:05.291
(Parker, whispering) The first time
I heard about Dreamworld was in '03.

07:05.360 --> 07:07.794
I was serving with the 173rd
in Kandahar at the time.

07:07.862 --> 07:10.429
The story stuck with
me, so about a year ago

07:10.497 --> 07:12.197
I started poking around.

07:13.437 --> 07:15.471
Found out it was a forward operating base

07:15.540 --> 07:17.240
in northern Afghanistan,

07:17.307 --> 07:21.011
- launching pad for covert special ops in the region.
- (Door opens)

07:21.078 --> 07:23.479
- (Door closes)
- (Lowered voice) Did Bronson work at that base?

07:23.548 --> 07:25.081
Yeah.

07:24.788 --> 07:26.455
Yeah, I'd heard his name a couple of times,

07:26.523 --> 07:27.656
so I approached him.

07:27.723 --> 07:29.291
And what'd he tell you?

07:29.358 --> 07:31.259
Nothing at all.

07:31.327 --> 07:33.662
In fact, he seemed pretty freaked out

07:33.729 --> 07:35.230
that I knew he was stationed there...

07:36.699 --> 07:38.433
Asking me how much I knew...

07:38.501 --> 07:41.670
about him, Dreamworld...

07:41.737 --> 07:44.071
about what he'd done.

07:44.138 --> 07:46.973
Wait, what... what did he mean by that?

07:47.041 --> 07:48.542
He never told me.

07:48.610 --> 07:50.143
Whatever it was,

07:50.212 --> 07:51.778
he sure as hell didn't want it getting out.

07:54.082 --> 07:57.351
Next thing I know, my
editor's killing the story...

07:58.920 --> 08:02.054
at the personal request
of Defense Secretary Reed.

08:02.122 --> 08:04.757
These conversations that
you had with Bronson...

08:04.825 --> 08:07.760
did he ever mention the word "Valkyrie"?

08:07.828 --> 08:09.629
No. Why? What's Valkyrie?

08:09.697 --> 08:10.863
(Lowered voice) Wait.

08:10.931 --> 08:13.433
The Secretary of Defense himself

08:13.500 --> 08:15.467
called to kill the story?

08:15.535 --> 08:17.336
That's unusual.

08:17.403 --> 08:20.505
Try unheard of. But I'm guessing

08:20.573 --> 08:22.407
that the subject matter struck a nerve.

08:22.475 --> 08:26.077
Look, prior to his appointment
as Secretary of Defense,

08:26.145 --> 08:30.081
General Reed was in
charge of Central Command,

08:30.149 --> 08:32.549
which ran all missions out of Dreamworld.

08:32.618 --> 08:34.784
Are you suggesting that
the Secretary of Defense

08:34.852 --> 08:36.086
is hiding something?

08:36.154 --> 08:38.688
You have another explanation?

08:40.745 --> 08:43.548
(Beckett) So a stolen military toxin

08:43.615 --> 08:45.249
and a secret government base.

08:45.317 --> 08:46.617
I mean, what do you
think this is all about?

08:46.685 --> 08:48.518
I don't know, but I have
a feeling Bronson did.

08:48.586 --> 08:49.852
Where are we headed?

08:49.920 --> 08:51.854
To talk to the one
person who might actually

08:51.922 --> 08:53.890
know what's going on.

08:53.957 --> 08:55.592
Former Commander of Dreamworld...

08:55.660 --> 08:57.260
Defense Secretary Reed.

09:04.234 --> 09:06.468
Mr. Secretary.

09:06.536 --> 09:09.104
(Door closes) This must be damned
important if the Attorney General's

09:09.172 --> 09:11.473
personally asking me to take this meeting.

09:11.541 --> 09:12.741
It is.

09:12.809 --> 09:15.043
Three days ago, a lethal toxin was stolen

09:15.111 --> 09:16.478
from a government lab.

09:16.546 --> 09:18.914
Our investigations led us to the murder

09:18.981 --> 09:21.015
of an ex-marine named Jack Bronson.

09:21.083 --> 09:23.284
- Do you know him?
- It's possible.

09:23.352 --> 09:25.486
A lot of men served under my command.

09:25.554 --> 09:27.855
Why? You think he was
involved in this theft?

09:27.923 --> 09:29.624
No, but he may have known who was.

09:29.692 --> 09:31.326
We believe that this is connected

09:31.393 --> 09:33.127
to a military base named Dreamworld.

09:33.195 --> 09:37.163
Well, I hate to break it to
you, but Dreamworld's a myth.

09:37.232 --> 09:39.466
It's military legend. It doesn't exist.

09:39.534 --> 09:41.401
- Are you kidding me? Are we actually
gonna play this game?
- Sir...

09:41.469 --> 09:43.036
Agent Beckett, was it?

09:43.104 --> 09:44.871
Whoever that toxin, if they use it,

09:44.939 --> 09:46.707
there will be mass casualties,

09:46.774 --> 09:49.075
- so if you know something...
- Sir.

09:49.143 --> 09:51.644
Someone was writing an
article about Dreamworld.

09:51.712 --> 09:55.281
You personally had that story killed. Why?

09:55.349 --> 09:59.619
Why? Because the enemy reads newspapers,

09:59.686 --> 10:03.122
and there's no way in hell
I'm gonna risk American lives

10:03.189 --> 10:05.558
by handing out operational details

10:05.626 --> 10:07.859
about a special ops base...

10:07.926 --> 10:09.761
<i>if such a base existed.</i>

10:09.828 --> 10:11.028
What about Bronson?

10:11.096 --> 10:14.399
What's his connection to that base?

10:14.467 --> 10:17.201
If it indeed does exist.

10:29.381 --> 10:32.783
Everything I'm about
to say is off the books.

10:32.850 --> 10:33.984
Are we clear?

10:34.051 --> 10:35.753
- Yes.
- Yes.

10:37.722 --> 10:41.190
Bronson was an outstanding marine.

10:41.258 --> 10:43.993
But he only worked one
mission out of there...

10:44.060 --> 10:45.961
a high-value air strike in Jalalabad

10:46.029 --> 10:49.499
that took out Anwar Zawari...
Al-Qaeda's number two.

10:49.566 --> 10:51.967
What was Bronson's role?

10:52.035 --> 10:53.603
He was our man on the ground.

10:53.671 --> 10:55.471
Set up in a nearby building.

10:55.539 --> 10:58.440
He reported when Zawari went in the house.

10:58.508 --> 11:01.277
Then, when the air strike was launched,

11:01.344 --> 11:03.712
he painted the house with a
laser to guide the missile.

11:03.780 --> 11:05.247
Did the word "Valkyrie"

11:05.315 --> 11:06.982
have anything to do with this strike?

11:07.050 --> 11:09.685
Was it the name of a
mission or a code name?

11:09.752 --> 11:11.420
No.

11:11.487 --> 11:13.288
It's not familiar.

11:13.355 --> 11:16.657
Look, that operation was a big win for us.

11:16.725 --> 11:20.261
It crippled Al-Qaeda's
entire command structure.

11:20.329 --> 11:23.731
Was there any talk of
Al-Qaeda retaliating?

11:23.799 --> 11:26.334
There was chatter. Always is.

11:26.401 --> 11:28.435
But we took out Zawari a year ago,

11:28.502 --> 11:30.003
and they never hit us back.

11:30.071 --> 11:32.505
Unless they just did.

11:32.573 --> 11:35.843
And this is just the beginning.

11:35.910 --> 11:37.277
I have homeland tightening security

11:37.345 --> 11:38.745
at every likely D.C. target...

11:38.813 --> 11:40.613
government buildings, tourist attractions,

11:40.681 --> 11:43.483
transit hubs. The bad news
is the toxin's versatile.

11:43.551 --> 11:45.117
It can be deployed through
the ventilation system,

11:45.185 --> 11:46.652
it could contaminate a reservoir,

11:46.720 --> 11:48.287
it can be detonated with a bomb

11:48.355 --> 11:51.423
and release a toxic plume
over part of this city.

11:51.491 --> 11:53.259
And if that happens, we'd
be dealing with a lot more

11:53.327 --> 11:54.994
than just a couple of deaths on our hands.

11:55.062 --> 11:57.629
And I am so sorry.

11:57.697 --> 11:59.398
No, it's... your job.

11:59.466 --> 12:02.200
And if we stop the next
attack, it might mean saving me.

12:02.268 --> 12:04.603
But if this is Al-Qaeda retaliation,

12:04.671 --> 12:06.304
how did they know about Bronson?

12:06.373 --> 12:08.073
He was on the ground during the air strike.

12:08.140 --> 12:09.575
He might have been seen by locals

12:09.642 --> 12:11.109
or Zawari family members.

12:11.177 --> 12:13.345
Well, let's check for
any Zawari family members,

12:13.413 --> 12:15.414
friends, or associates in the D.C. area.

12:15.482 --> 12:17.081
If Al-Qaeda is about to strike,

12:17.148 --> 12:19.083
they must have people on the ground.

12:19.150 --> 12:20.752
(Inhales sharply)

12:22.554 --> 12:25.356
I'll be in the tech room.

12:27.659 --> 12:28.559
Look...

12:28.627 --> 12:30.361
I'm okay.

12:30.429 --> 12:33.296
- (Ringtone plays "Toccata and fugue in 'D' minor")
- I... (Sighs)

12:33.364 --> 12:35.499
It's my mother. She's
been calling all morning.

12:35.566 --> 12:37.901
I can't, uh, avoid her forever.

12:37.968 --> 12:39.969
(Beep) Hello, mother.

12:40.037 --> 12:42.238
- To what do I owe the pleasure?
- Richard.

12:42.306 --> 12:43.640
You were ushered out of here last night

12:43.708 --> 12:45.041
like a common criminal.

12:45.109 --> 12:47.110
You don't answer my calls.
What the hell is going on?

12:47.177 --> 12:49.211
No... mother, I'm... I'm fine.

12:49.279 --> 12:50.546
Dad, did they arrest you?

12:50.614 --> 12:51.881
Do you need us to bail you out?

12:51.948 --> 12:54.349
Ooh! What about a lawyer, Mr. C.?

12:54.418 --> 12:55.951
I know a guy at the A.C.L.U.

12:56.019 --> 12:56.952
Oh, please. (Beep)

12:57.020 --> 12:58.387
No.

12:58.455 --> 13:01.557
Uh, I just had some, uh, special knowledge

13:01.625 --> 13:03.258
of a case that Beckett's working on.

13:03.326 --> 13:05.159
She had them send an escort, that's all.

13:05.227 --> 13:07.529
Oh. Well, thank God.

13:07.596 --> 13:09.597
Um... oh, Gina called this morning.

13:09.665 --> 13:11.733
She has, uh, a bunch
of books for you to sign

13:11.801 --> 13:14.135
for some company V.I.Ps.

13:14.202 --> 13:15.703
Right. Um...

13:15.771 --> 13:18.039
they're in my office at
the, uh, back bookcase.

13:18.106 --> 13:20.908
If I'm...

13:20.975 --> 13:22.175
if I'm not there tomorrow,

13:22.243 --> 13:25.011
she can come pick them up.

13:25.079 --> 13:26.947
And, mother...

13:28.215 --> 13:29.316
Thank you.

13:31.252 --> 13:32.519
When's he coming back?

13:32.587 --> 13:34.922
Let me talk to Alexis.

13:34.989 --> 13:37.990
He wants to talk to you, honey.

13:38.058 --> 13:39.659
Uh...

13:41.227 --> 13:42.728
Hey, dad.

13:42.796 --> 13:44.396
Hopefully I'll be back tomorrow morning.

13:44.465 --> 13:47.066
And, um...

13:47.133 --> 13:48.601
you know I love you, right?

13:48.669 --> 13:50.536
Of course.

13:52.505 --> 13:54.238
(Lowered voice) It's
time for your next shot.

13:54.306 --> 13:55.740
Already?

13:55.808 --> 13:59.210
Dad? Everything okay?

13:59.278 --> 14:01.746
Yeah. They're calling me,

14:01.814 --> 14:04.716
so I have to go.

14:04.784 --> 14:06.885
Okay.

14:06.953 --> 14:08.252
See you tomorrow.

14:09.754 --> 14:11.388
Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow.

14:11.456 --> 14:14.925
(Clatter)

14:14.993 --> 14:17.294
(Cell phone beeps)

14:17.362 --> 14:19.229
(Beep)

14:19.297 --> 14:21.565
Did dad sound weird to you?

14:25.235 --> 14:27.269
Sir, we've got something.

14:27.337 --> 14:29.005
Turns out you were right
about Zawari's family.

14:29.072 --> 14:32.876
We identified six members of his
extended family living in the U.S...

14:32.943 --> 14:36.345
Four in California and two
cousins right here in D.C.

14:36.413 --> 14:37.947
We were in the process of running them down

14:38.015 --> 14:39.549
when Hendricks found this.

14:39.617 --> 14:41.750
In reconstructing Bronson's
movements prior to his death,

14:41.818 --> 14:44.152
we were able to track him to here,

14:44.220 --> 14:46.087
a coffee shop in Dupont Circle.

14:46.155 --> 14:48.123
A few seconds after he leaves,

14:48.190 --> 14:51.126
this man follows him out.

14:51.193 --> 14:54.630
We've I.D.'d him as Waqas Rasheed,

14:54.697 --> 14:56.131
second cousin to Zawari.

14:56.198 --> 14:58.298
(Hendricks) And Agent Richmond
is trying to track him down,

14:58.366 --> 14:59.767
but here's what we know...

14:59.835 --> 15:01.802
he has dual U.S./Afghan citizenship,

15:01.870 --> 15:04.271
is a graduate engineering
student at Georgetown.

15:04.339 --> 15:06.140
And, sir, he was in Jalalabad

15:06.207 --> 15:08.275
the night of the Zawari air strike.

15:08.343 --> 15:11.245
Five of his other cousins
were killed in the attack.

15:11.312 --> 15:12.546
Burying that many family members,

15:12.613 --> 15:14.047
that could radicalize anyone.

15:14.114 --> 15:16.115
- (Computer beeps)
- Got him. We got him.

15:16.183 --> 15:17.717
We have a live feed of Rasheed

15:17.785 --> 15:20.403
walking east on 14th
Street between "E" and "F."

15:20.903 --> 15:22.971
- Backpack.
- Could be the toxin.

15:23.039 --> 15:24.940
- And the antidote.
- Let's move!

15:25.007 --> 15:28.609
(Indistinct conversations)

15:32.081 --> 15:34.748
(Tires screech, doors open)

15:34.816 --> 15:36.284
Stop! Stop!

15:38.253 --> 15:40.154
Federal agents! Stop!

15:40.222 --> 15:44.424
(Tires screech, horns honking)

15:44.492 --> 15:46.893
(Grunts) (Grunts)

15:46.961 --> 15:49.696
(Panting)

15:50.936 --> 15:51.515
It's not here.

15:53.332 --> 15:54.066
(Panting) Where's the toxin?

15:54.615 --> 15:56.188
Rasheed! Where's the toxin?

16:00.803 --> 16:02.237
What if he doesn't talk?

16:02.305 --> 16:03.871
He'll talk. They always do.

16:03.939 --> 16:06.607
What if he doesn't talk in time?

16:06.675 --> 16:07.875
We have teams combing his apartment.

16:07.943 --> 16:11.379
If he has the toxin and the
antidote, they'll find 'em.

16:11.447 --> 16:13.381
Thanks...

16:13.449 --> 16:14.615
for letting me be a part of this.

16:16.218 --> 16:17.652
When you write your next novel,

16:17.720 --> 16:19.086
maybe you'll find a place

16:19.154 --> 16:21.588
for a dashing
Colombian-American federal agent.

16:21.656 --> 16:23.457
- Consider it done.
- (Chuckles)

16:23.524 --> 16:25.559
Anything at Rasheed's?

16:25.626 --> 16:27.527
We went over every inch of his place,

16:27.595 --> 16:30.731
and there is no sign of
the antidote or the toxin.

16:30.798 --> 16:32.966
He may have hidden it somewhere.

16:33.033 --> 16:34.835
Either that or it's already out there,

16:34.902 --> 16:36.869
ready to be deployed.

16:43.042 --> 16:43.909
Break him.

16:50.283 --> 16:52.350
So why am I here?

16:52.418 --> 16:53.752
What's this about? Huh?

16:53.819 --> 16:57.455
You're related to Anwar
Zawari. Is that correct?

16:59.191 --> 17:00.725
A man doesn't choose his family.

17:00.793 --> 17:03.628
Okay? I had nothing to do
with Anwar or his beliefs.

17:03.696 --> 17:06.030
Yet you were in Jalalabad
the night that he died.

17:06.098 --> 17:08.732
Yes, but not to see him.
I have relatives there.

17:08.800 --> 17:11.468
I was spending time with them for Ramadan.

17:11.536 --> 17:13.203
I understand that five of your relatives

17:13.271 --> 17:15.105
were killed in that U.S. missile strike.

17:15.172 --> 17:19.041
And for that I blame Anwar,
and them for being with him.

17:19.109 --> 17:20.676
Now why am I here?

17:20.744 --> 17:22.646
You studied engineering.

17:22.714 --> 17:24.414
Specifically, electrical system designs

17:24.481 --> 17:26.382
for commercial buildings.

17:26.450 --> 17:28.550
(Chuckles)

17:28.619 --> 17:31.621
You have a gift for making
every fact sound sinister.

17:31.688 --> 17:34.490
Well, you'd be able to
break into a secure facility.

17:34.558 --> 17:36.659
I didn't break into anything.

17:38.429 --> 17:42.297
I want an attorney. I have
a right to an attorney.

17:42.364 --> 17:44.666
Enemy combatants don't
get attorneys... or trials.

17:44.734 --> 17:46.735
Where is the toxin, Rasheed?

17:46.803 --> 17:48.870
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- I think you do.

17:48.938 --> 17:51.005
In fact, I know you do. (Photo rustles)

17:51.073 --> 17:53.542
This is Jack Bronson, former U.S. marine.

17:53.609 --> 17:56.009
He was in Jalalabad
the night of the strike.

17:56.077 --> 17:57.678
And this...

17:57.746 --> 18:01.381
is you, following him
outside of a coffee shop.

18:01.450 --> 18:03.016
Three hours later, he was dead.

18:03.084 --> 18:04.718
You're not gonna tell me
that that's a coincidence.

18:10.859 --> 18:12.058
This is about him?

18:15.463 --> 18:16.696
Well, you have it wrong.

18:20.601 --> 18:21.901
I wasn't following him.

18:23.203 --> 18:26.439
He was following me.

18:26.507 --> 18:28.807
Why would he be following you?

18:28.875 --> 18:32.077
He wanted to know if I talked to anybody...

18:32.144 --> 18:33.612
about our secret.

18:33.680 --> 18:36.081
Your secret?

18:36.148 --> 18:38.550
What secret?

18:42.154 --> 18:43.554
The night of the missile strike,

18:43.622 --> 18:45.756
I was, uh, at my brother's home.

18:45.824 --> 18:48.025
It's just a block away from Anwar's.

18:48.093 --> 18:50.661
I heard the explosion. I ran out.

18:52.163 --> 18:55.299
The house was destroyed. And
I was the first one there,

18:55.367 --> 18:59.436
so I wanted to see if
there were any survivors.

18:59.504 --> 19:01.771
And that's, uh...

19:01.839 --> 19:03.874
that's when I saw Bronson,

19:03.941 --> 19:06.510
standing there in the
rubble, holding a body.

19:06.577 --> 19:08.945
Whose body?

19:09.013 --> 19:10.413
A young woman.

19:10.481 --> 19:12.582
One of the servants in the house.

19:12.650 --> 19:14.818
And when he saw me, he...

19:14.886 --> 19:18.020
drew his gun.

19:20.056 --> 19:21.957
And I thought for sure I was a dead man.

19:22.025 --> 19:23.826
But then he spoke.

19:25.194 --> 19:26.695
And he knew my name

19:26.763 --> 19:30.265
and where I lived and what I did.

19:30.333 --> 19:33.467
And he told me that if I told
anyone about what I had seen,

19:33.536 --> 19:34.802
he would kill me.

19:37.506 --> 19:40.642
And then he left...

19:40.709 --> 19:42.376
with the body.

19:43.946 --> 19:47.415
He took away a dead servant's body?

19:47.482 --> 19:50.717
I've done my best to forget about it all,

19:50.785 --> 19:52.619
until he found me in the coffee shop,

19:52.687 --> 19:54.487
and he kept asking me, "who did you tell?

19:54.556 --> 19:55.889
Why are they setting me
up?" And I swore to him

19:55.957 --> 19:57.958
I didn't tell anybody.

19:57.991 --> 20:01.292
Okay, whatever is happening
here, whatever is going on,

20:01.360 --> 20:03.528
I swear to you I have
nothing to do with it.

20:03.595 --> 20:06.296
So none of the intelligence
agencies can link Rasheed

20:06.364 --> 20:08.866
to known Al-Qaeda elements.

20:08.934 --> 20:10.835
And... (Folder thuds on table)

20:10.903 --> 20:14.238
He's got a solid alibi for
the night of the break-in.

20:14.305 --> 20:16.440
He could still be involved.

20:16.508 --> 20:18.943
Is there any chatter
about an imminent attack?

20:19.011 --> 20:20.476
No more than usual.

20:20.545 --> 20:22.278
What's your take on Rasheed?

20:22.346 --> 20:26.983
(Sighs) I don't think he's our guy.

20:27.051 --> 20:29.185
His story. I mean, he
said that he saw Bronson

20:29.253 --> 20:31.287
carrying a servant girl's body.

20:31.355 --> 20:32.756
I mean, the only way that he'd come up

20:32.823 --> 20:35.124
with a story like that was if it was true.

20:35.192 --> 20:37.459
So aside from the name "Valkyrie,"

20:37.527 --> 20:40.729
seems to know anything about,

20:40.797 --> 20:44.466
we pretty much have nothing,
which means I'm a dead man.

20:44.534 --> 20:47.002
No, Castle. Not nothing.

20:47.070 --> 20:49.438
We have what Bronson told
you, what Rasheed told us.

20:49.505 --> 20:51.606
We know that this revolves around something

20:51.674 --> 20:53.775
that happened the night Zawari was killed,

20:53.842 --> 20:56.277
something more than just the air strike.

20:56.344 --> 20:58.312
Now what we have to do
is figure out what it was.

20:58.380 --> 21:00.481
(Villante) I'll have D.O.D.
send over the mission documents.

21:00.549 --> 21:02.550
Maybe something in there
will help shed some light.

21:02.618 --> 21:05.252
(Footsteps retreat)

21:10.091 --> 21:12.025
(Beckett) These are the mission documents?

21:12.093 --> 21:14.795
Is there even a sentence
that doesn't have redactions?

21:14.862 --> 21:16.496
Not a complete one.

21:16.564 --> 21:19.265
Somebody is definitely trying
to hide whatever went on here.

21:19.333 --> 21:22.836
I... I'm sorry, Castle. This is pointless.

21:22.904 --> 21:24.637
Can you do a word search for "Valkyrie"?

21:24.705 --> 21:27.573
(Typing, computer beeps)

21:27.641 --> 21:29.174
(Whirring)

21:29.242 --> 21:31.577
(Beep) (Richmond) It doesn't
appear in the document.

21:31.645 --> 21:32.845
Probably because it's redacted.

21:32.913 --> 21:34.647
Right. But what about

21:34.715 --> 21:36.682
a search for blacked-out 8-letter words

21:36.750 --> 21:39.318
the same length as "Valkyrie"?

21:39.385 --> 21:42.320
Aren't all 8-letter words the same length?

21:42.387 --> 21:44.522
Well, not in a proportional
font like Times Roman.

21:44.590 --> 21:48.126
Um... each character will vary in size

21:48.193 --> 21:51.062
from the narrowest... a lowercase "I"...

21:51.130 --> 21:53.197
to the widest... the uppercase "W."

21:53.265 --> 21:55.966
So the combination of
letters in the word "Valkyrie"

21:56.034 --> 21:58.068
will create a very specific length,

21:58.136 --> 22:00.037
not unlike a typographical fingerprint.

22:00.105 --> 22:01.872
I may be able to work with that.

22:01.940 --> 22:03.707
If we can find the blacked-out "Valkyrie,"

22:03.775 --> 22:04.908
we might be able to
figure out what it means

22:04.976 --> 22:06.309
from the words around it.

22:06.377 --> 22:07.645
It's a long shot, I know.

22:07.712 --> 22:09.013
- Not that long. We got some hits.
- (Beeps)

22:09.080 --> 22:11.948
These are thumbnails of the whole document.

22:12.016 --> 22:13.750
It's everywhere, highlighted in red.

22:13.817 --> 22:15.451
The last page seems to have
the largest concentration.

22:15.519 --> 22:16.919
Can you enlarge it?

22:16.987 --> 22:19.055
(Types) (Beep)

22:19.123 --> 22:21.758
"Target acquired." "Missile engaged."

22:21.825 --> 22:23.559
"Target destroyed."

22:23.627 --> 22:26.395
This is the transcript
to the missile strike.

22:26.463 --> 22:28.364
Maybe "Valkyrie" is the
code name for Zawari.

22:28.431 --> 22:29.898
No, it's got to be more than that,

22:29.966 --> 22:32.635
but there's not enough context
to piece this thing together.

22:32.702 --> 22:34.803
What we need is an un-redacted transcript.

22:36.773 --> 22:38.840
Or the original audio recording.

22:38.908 --> 22:41.009
What are you thinking, Richmond?

22:41.077 --> 22:43.312
For a strike in Jalalabad,

22:43.380 --> 22:46.247
they'd probably use an
F-16 out of Bagram air base.

22:46.315 --> 22:49.750
I did a year as Chief
Technical Officer at Bagram.

22:49.818 --> 22:52.619
Part of my job was dumping
the fighter jets' flight data

22:52.687 --> 22:55.189
onto a central server.

22:55.256 --> 22:57.491
If I can access it,

22:57.559 --> 22:59.293
I might be able to get that audio.

22:59.360 --> 23:01.395
(Beckett) What are we waiting for, McCord?

23:01.462 --> 23:04.665
We played by the rules, and
that's what they gave us.

23:09.169 --> 23:10.203
Do it.

23:12.673 --> 23:16.209
(Cell phone rings)

23:16.276 --> 23:18.344
Castle. It's your mom.

23:18.412 --> 23:19.812
What do you want me to tell her?

23:19.879 --> 23:23.148
(Ring)

23:23.216 --> 23:24.949
(Line rings, click, beep)

23:25.017 --> 23:27.419
<i>You've reached the voice-mail
of Special Agent Kate Beckett</i>

23:27.486 --> 23:28.486
<i>at the Attorney General's office.</i>

23:28.554 --> 23:30.054
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

23:30.122 --> 23:32.156
(Beep)

23:32.225 --> 23:33.758
(Elevator bell dings)

23:33.826 --> 23:36.261
I just always thought that you and I

23:36.329 --> 23:37.762
would have kids together.

23:37.830 --> 23:39.664
Really? Well, have you
talked to Jenny about this?

23:39.732 --> 23:41.199
(Sighs) No, you know what I mean.

23:41.266 --> 23:43.167
They'd be on the same
T-ball and pop warner teams.

23:43.235 --> 23:44.802
- We'd co-coach.
- Co-coach?

23:44.870 --> 23:46.237
- You want to be head coach?
- Yeah.

23:46.304 --> 23:47.939
- Try getting a date first.
- Dude.

23:48.006 --> 23:51.575
Hey. Martha. What brings you here?

23:51.643 --> 23:53.410
Look, I know you're busy, but I'm...

23:53.478 --> 23:55.746
- I'm worried about Richard.
- Really? Why?

23:55.813 --> 23:57.447
Last night, he was just whisked away

23:57.514 --> 24:00.016
by a couple of federal agent... thugs.

24:00.084 --> 24:02.085
Then when I talked to him today,

24:02.153 --> 24:05.355
he was nice, sincere, no smart-ass quips.

24:05.422 --> 24:08.324
So... something is definitely wrong.

24:08.392 --> 24:11.128
And Katherine isn't answering my calls.

24:11.195 --> 24:13.929
Well, uh, I'm sure there's an explanation.

24:13.997 --> 24:15.665
And I need you to find out what it is.

24:15.733 --> 24:16.999
(Sighs)

24:17.067 --> 24:18.501
Any trouble breathing?

24:18.569 --> 24:21.337
Yeah, but I... I think that's just anxiety.

24:21.405 --> 24:24.006
- I can get you a sedative.
- No.

24:24.074 --> 24:27.209
I... thank you. I think I'd rather
stay sharp as long as possible.

24:27.278 --> 24:28.244
(Tape rips)

24:28.311 --> 24:29.444
Oh, sorry.

24:29.512 --> 24:31.346
No, no problem. We're all done here.

24:31.414 --> 24:34.516
You want a coffee?

24:34.584 --> 24:37.319
Uh, no, I'd rather die than
drink any more of that sludge.

24:37.387 --> 24:39.554
- Oh.
- Too soon?

24:41.491 --> 24:42.758
(Coffee pouring)

24:42.825 --> 24:45.092
Agent McCord, can I ask you a question?

24:45.160 --> 24:47.094
Yeah.

24:47.162 --> 24:50.464
How is she doing... here?

24:50.532 --> 24:53.734
Beckett? She's good. She
has a lot of potential.

24:53.802 --> 24:56.970
So she'll be okay.

24:57.038 --> 25:01.741
Hey. She's gonna be great.

25:04.178 --> 25:06.713
Hey, McCord. I'm in.

25:06.781 --> 25:08.881
I cross-referenced the
flight recording database

25:08.949 --> 25:12.118
at Bagram with parameters
from the mission documents.

25:12.186 --> 25:13.787
(Beep) If that information was accurate,

25:13.854 --> 25:17.122
this should be audio of the Zawari strike.

25:17.190 --> 25:19.758
<i>(Alarm sounding) (Man) Alpha
one, Eagle's contact target.</i>

25:19.826 --> 25:22.461
<i>(Man) Copy, Eagle. Omaha,
what's your status? Over.</i>

25:22.529 --> 25:24.396
That's Defense Secretary Reed.

25:24.464 --> 25:26.765
As theater commander, he'd
be running the operation.

25:26.833 --> 25:29.635
<i>(Man) Alpha One, Valkyrie
still inside target.</i>

25:29.703 --> 25:32.470
That's Bronson's voice.
So Valkyrie must be Zawari.

25:32.538 --> 25:34.972
<i>Eagle, prepare to engage.</i>

25:35.040 --> 25:36.541
<i>Alpha One, Valkyrie still inside.</i>

25:36.608 --> 25:38.275
<i>Signaling to get her out.</i>

25:38.344 --> 25:40.345
Get "her" out? Valkyrie's not Zawari.

25:40.412 --> 25:41.846
Maybe it's the servant.

25:41.913 --> 25:44.749
<i>Omaha, Valkyrie needs to get out now.</i>

25:44.817 --> 25:48.118
<i>I'm signaling, Alpha One.
No response. Stand by.</i>

25:48.186 --> 25:49.653
<i>We're not missing our window.</i>

25:49.721 --> 25:52.823
<i>Eagle, this is Alpha One. Engage target.</i>

25:52.890 --> 25:55.892
<i>Negative, Eagle. We have an
American intelligence asset</i>

25:55.960 --> 25:57.461
<i>in there, and we need to
wait for her get her out.</i>

25:57.528 --> 25:58.495
An intelligence asset?

25:58.563 --> 25:59.996
<i>Just give me two minutes.</i>

26:00.064 --> 26:03.233
<i>Negative, Omaha. We
can't risk losing Raptor.</i>

26:03.300 --> 26:06.802
<i>On my authority, you are
clear to engage target. Over.</i>

26:06.871 --> 26:08.872
<i>- (Man) Missile engaged.
- (Missile whooshes)</i>

26:08.939 --> 26:11.274
<i>No! Valkyrie's still in there. (Explosion)</i>

26:13.452 --> 26:15.014
<i>Target destroyed. Eagle heading home.</i>

26:15.546 --> 26:17.347
<i>Omaha, retrieve Valkyrie's body</i>

26:17.415 --> 26:19.583
<i>and get her back to Dreamworld.</i>

26:19.650 --> 26:21.917
<i>- Protocol Boomerang. Over.
- Roger.</i>

26:21.984 --> 26:25.187
<i>Valkyrie was the servant.
She was one of ours.</i>

26:25.255 --> 26:28.190
No wonder the transcript
was so heavily redacted.

26:28.258 --> 26:30.859
Secretary Reed killed
an American operative.

26:30.927 --> 26:33.529
And then ordered Bronson to cover it up.

26:35.522 --> 26:37.255
<i>- (Man) Missile engaged.
- (Missile whooshes)</i>

26:37.622 --> 26:40.185
<i>- (Bronson) No! Valkyrie's still in there.
- (Explosion)</i>

26:40.778 --> 26:43.479
<i>Target destroyed. Eagle heading home.</i>

26:43.547 --> 26:46.015
<i>(Reed) Omaha, retrieve Valkyrie's body</i>

26:46.083 --> 26:48.084
<i>and get her back to Dreamworld.</i>

26:48.152 --> 26:49.451
<i>Protocol Boomerang. Over.</i>

26:49.519 --> 26:51.054
<i>Roger.</i>

26:51.121 --> 26:53.056
(Recording stops playing)

26:53.850 --> 26:55.583
So what are we saying here?

26:55.651 --> 26:58.420
That Bronson was murdered
to cover up the death

26:58.487 --> 27:00.021
of an American operative?

27:00.088 --> 27:03.090
With the implication that
General Reed is behind it?

27:03.158 --> 27:05.226
The sitting Secretary of Defense?

27:05.294 --> 27:07.995
A position he got largely
because of his success

27:08.063 --> 27:09.363
in taking out Zawari.

27:09.432 --> 27:10.898
His political star was on the rise.

27:10.965 --> 27:14.501
Maybe he couldn't afford to
have damaging details out there.

27:14.569 --> 27:16.437
But if he wanted to silence Bronson,

27:16.504 --> 27:17.504
why would he go through the trouble

27:17.572 --> 27:19.172
of setting him up first?

27:19.240 --> 27:21.975
And none of this explains
the theft of the toxin.

27:22.043 --> 27:24.845
Sir, he lied to us about
Valkyrie and about Bronson.

27:24.913 --> 27:26.212
Either he's involved,

27:26.280 --> 27:29.248
or he knows a hell of a lot
more than he's telling us.

27:29.316 --> 27:31.283
Only you have no proof.

27:31.351 --> 27:35.354
Listen, Beckett, I know what's at stake

27:35.422 --> 27:36.656
for you and for Castle,

27:36.723 --> 27:38.758
but... I can't let you go at him

27:38.826 --> 27:42.194
without concrete evidence.

27:45.230 --> 27:47.198
Hey. So I'm guessing Villante said "no"

27:47.266 --> 27:49.067
to the idea of water-boarding the truth

27:49.134 --> 27:50.168
out of Secretary Reed.

27:50.235 --> 27:52.637
Yeah. Something like that.

27:52.705 --> 27:54.773
How are you feeling?

27:54.841 --> 27:59.610
Ah. Good. I think I'm
just due for another shot.

28:06.852 --> 28:09.019
(Car door closes)

28:09.087 --> 28:10.855
I'm Agent Beckett from the
Attorney General's office.

28:10.922 --> 28:13.156
- I need to speak with Secretary Reed.
- Do you have an appointment?

28:13.224 --> 28:14.724
No, this is a matter of national security.

28:14.792 --> 28:16.626
I'm sorry. If you don't
have an appointment,

28:16.694 --> 28:18.060
- I have to ask you...
- I... I understand. Just please get to the secretary.

28:18.128 --> 28:19.762
I told you, this is a matter of national...

28:19.830 --> 28:21.097
- Ma'am, you need to step back.
- Secretary Reed?

28:21.164 --> 28:22.064
Secretary Reed, Agent Beckett...

28:22.132 --> 28:23.199
Step back.

28:23.266 --> 28:24.567
From the Attorney General's office.

28:24.635 --> 28:25.835
We met earlier today, sir.

28:25.903 --> 28:27.670
Michael, who is that?

28:27.738 --> 28:29.706
- I'll take care of it.
- (Man) Ma'am, you need to step back

28:29.773 --> 28:31.373
- to your vehicle right now.
- Sir, we just need to speak.

28:31.440 --> 28:33.976
- This is a matter of national security.
- Joseph.

28:37.246 --> 28:39.681
You show up at my home?

28:39.749 --> 28:41.249
Who the hell do you think you are?

28:41.317 --> 28:42.651
I should ask you the same thing.

28:42.719 --> 28:44.553
You lied about Valkyrie.

28:44.621 --> 28:47.488
- (Car door closes)
- You obstructed a federal investigation.

28:47.556 --> 28:49.557
I told you all you need to know.

28:49.625 --> 28:52.126
I need to know everything.
What is going on,

28:52.193 --> 28:53.794
and what are you hiding?

28:53.862 --> 28:56.296
You are barking up the wrong tree, Agent,

28:56.364 --> 28:57.832
and it's gonna cost ya.

28:57.900 --> 29:00.568
There's a deadly toxin out there.

29:00.636 --> 29:04.938
If so much as one person dies
because you won't cooperate,

29:05.006 --> 29:06.439
- then I...
- You'll what?

29:06.507 --> 29:09.976
Look, whatever this is, it
has nothing to do with me.

29:10.044 --> 29:13.413
You might wanna remember
the first rule of combat.

29:13.480 --> 29:16.115
You don't ever start a war you can't win.

29:21.320 --> 29:24.356
(Cell phone rings)

29:24.424 --> 29:26.358
(Door opens and closes)

29:26.426 --> 29:27.626
(Cell phone beeps)

29:27.694 --> 29:28.961
What?

29:29.029 --> 29:31.296
Hey, Beckett. It's, uh, Esposito and Ryan.

29:31.364 --> 29:32.397
Is everything okay?

29:32.465 --> 29:33.732
Fine. Why?

29:33.800 --> 29:38.002
Castle's mom came by,
all worried about him.

29:38.070 --> 29:40.704
Come on, Beckett. What's going on?

29:45.043 --> 29:47.211
Everything's fine.

29:47.279 --> 29:48.212
(Beep)

29:52.384 --> 29:54.318
Keep taking it in through the nose,

29:54.386 --> 29:55.586
out through the mouth.

29:55.653 --> 29:56.687
Like yoga.

29:56.754 --> 29:58.889
What the hell were you thinking?

29:58.957 --> 30:00.390
Sir, I was just following a hunch.

30:00.491 --> 30:01.758
Next time, follow orders.

30:01.826 --> 30:04.695
I had to go to the mat with the
Attorney General to keep your job.

30:04.762 --> 30:07.497
Wait. Secretary Reed complained
to the Attorney General?

30:07.565 --> 30:10.230
If that surprises you, you're
not as smart as I thought.

30:09.959 --> 30:12.548
No, sir, it's just, if
Reed was behind this,

30:12.745 --> 30:13.781
he wouldn't have made that call.

30:13.965 --> 30:16.166
Right, because he wouldn't want
to call attention to himself.

30:18.620 --> 30:19.609
Is that why you went out there?

30:20.503 --> 30:21.774
To force him to show his hand?

30:24.610 --> 30:26.819
(Sighs) I'm impressed.

30:28.048 --> 30:28.783
Yeah, well, don't be.

30:30.131 --> 30:32.281
Looks like I just ruled out our only lead.

30:33.041 --> 30:34.242
(Speaking inaudibly)

30:35.557 --> 30:36.687
(McCord) Guys, I got something.

30:37.401 --> 30:38.601
I was following up on Valkyrie

30:38.669 --> 30:40.203
to see if there was
anything more to the story.

30:41.146 --> 30:43.814
This is a family photo we got from Rasheed.
(Clicks key, beep)

30:44.457 --> 30:46.390
- He identified this woman...
- (Clicks key, whooshing)

30:46.459 --> 30:49.504
As the servant whose body Bronson took

30:49.694 --> 30:50.282
after the air strike.

30:50.350 --> 30:54.020
(Key clicks, beep) And we've
identified her as Farrah Usman.

30:54.088 --> 30:55.287
She's listed as a civilian contractor

30:55.355 --> 30:57.456
working out of the U.S. consulate in Kabul.

30:57.524 --> 31:00.391
It's a typical cover for
an intelligence operative.

31:00.459 --> 31:02.828
Now she was supposedly
killed by a roadside I.E.D.

31:02.895 --> 31:04.162
The same night as the Zawari attack.

31:04.230 --> 31:05.664
Well, that makes sense.

31:05.732 --> 31:08.500
The injuries from an I.E.D. look a
lot like those from an air strike.

31:09.529 --> 31:10.659
That's not the story. Look at this.

31:10.921 --> 31:12.054
So Farrah Usman's body

31:12.123 --> 31:13.889
was shipped back to Dover two days later

31:13.957 --> 31:15.258
and was claimed by this man.

31:15.326 --> 31:16.592
(Keys clicking)

31:16.799 --> 31:18.767
You recognize that name?

31:18.834 --> 31:21.737
Brad Parker? The reporter?

31:21.804 --> 31:23.605
One and the same. (Clicks key)

31:23.673 --> 31:27.242
(Beep) I don't get it. How
is he connected to Valkyrie?

31:27.310 --> 31:29.978
According to the paperwork,
he was her fiancé.

31:31.714 --> 31:34.682
He's involved in this whole thing.

31:37.648 --> 31:39.014
As a combat vet, Brad
Parker would have known

31:39.082 --> 31:40.416
his fiancée's injuries
weren't from an I.E.D.

31:41.572 --> 31:44.006
That's why he was doing
the story on Dreamworld

31:44.074 --> 31:45.440
and why he tracked down Bronson.

31:45.508 --> 31:47.275
He was trying to figure
out how she actually died.

31:47.343 --> 31:49.544
(McCord) And he's ex-military.

31:49.612 --> 31:51.346
He would have had the skills
to pull off that heist.

31:51.414 --> 31:52.748
So what are we saying here?

31:52.815 --> 31:55.316
That Parker stole the toxin
because of his fiancée?

31:55.385 --> 31:56.885
That this is about revenge?

31:56.952 --> 31:58.953
Well, the toxin would be perfect for that.

31:59.021 --> 32:01.655
It's deadly and undetectable via autopsy

32:01.723 --> 32:03.156
unless you're specifically looking for it.

32:03.224 --> 32:04.892
Which is why he tried to hide
the fact that it was stolen

32:04.959 --> 32:07.828
by staging the other theft in
the building and framing Bronson.

32:07.896 --> 32:09.530
Where are we on tracking Parker?

32:09.598 --> 32:11.866
He's not at work. No
one's seen him all day.

32:11.933 --> 32:13.166
I can't get a trace on his cell signal.

32:13.234 --> 32:14.435
He must have turned it off.

32:14.503 --> 32:15.335
Sir, if there's the slightest chance...

32:15.404 --> 32:17.203
Hit his apartment. Go.

32:17.271 --> 32:19.939
Castle.

32:20.007 --> 32:21.508
You stay here.

32:21.575 --> 32:23.276
I was given less than a day to live

32:23.343 --> 32:25.011
just a little less than a day ago.

32:25.078 --> 32:27.947
If Parker has that antidote,
I need to go with them.

32:29.249 --> 32:30.283
Okay.

32:33.185 --> 32:34.553
(Guns cocking)

32:39.692 --> 32:41.092
(Doors opening)

32:41.160 --> 32:42.260
(Man) Clear!

32:42.328 --> 32:44.062
(Hendricks) Bedroom's clear!

32:44.130 --> 32:46.498
Clear. Where the hell is this guy?

32:46.566 --> 32:48.233
(Beckett) All right,
guys, let's get to work.

32:48.301 --> 32:51.069
If that toxin or antidote are
in here, I want them found.

32:57.843 --> 32:59.911
These are blueprints
of the research building

32:59.979 --> 33:01.879
the toxin was stolen from.

33:01.948 --> 33:06.383
And a confidential file on
the toxin. Parker's our guy.

33:06.451 --> 33:07.684
He's got a background on Secretary Reed.

33:07.752 --> 33:08.953
Research materials.

33:09.020 --> 33:10.854
Reed's his next target.

33:10.922 --> 33:12.722
He's going after the
man that gave the order

33:12.790 --> 33:14.325
that killed his fiancée.

33:14.392 --> 33:16.393
And I think I know where.

33:16.461 --> 33:18.762
This is confirmation of
Parker's press credentials

33:18.830 --> 33:20.097
for Reed's address at the Naval Academy.

33:20.165 --> 33:22.332
Reed's talking to new
cadets at 5:00 P.M. today.

33:22.399 --> 33:24.533
- That's in 20 minutes.
- We gotta lock Reed down.

33:24.601 --> 33:26.436
Secure Parker and get that antidote.

33:26.503 --> 33:28.704
(Brakes squeal, gears shift)

33:30.540 --> 33:33.676
(Band playing march in distance)

33:33.743 --> 33:35.678
Thanks for coming, Mr. Secretary.

33:35.745 --> 33:37.712
It's my pleasure, Admiral Johnson.

33:37.780 --> 33:39.781
It's nice to get out of the office.

33:39.849 --> 33:42.317
Hope you don't mind that
we do the press line first.

33:42.385 --> 33:43.718
Oh, that's fine.

33:43.786 --> 33:46.721
(Tires screeching)

33:51.427 --> 33:52.727
Do we want me to get a hold of Dr. Goldberg

33:52.795 --> 33:54.095
and have him meet us there?

33:54.162 --> 33:56.297
He already gave me my last shot.

33:56.365 --> 33:59.967
The only thing that can
help me now is the antidote.

34:00.035 --> 34:02.269
(Static crackles) Naval
academy's press department

34:02.337 --> 34:03.971
says Parker hasn't checked in yet.

34:04.039 --> 34:06.507
Security teams are already
on site looking for him.

34:06.574 --> 34:08.175
Copy that.

34:08.243 --> 34:09.609
Doesn't make any sense.

34:09.676 --> 34:11.643
Why wouldn't Parker be there yet?

34:11.712 --> 34:12.911
There's thousands of people there.

34:12.980 --> 34:14.380
Maybe they just haven't spotted him yet.

34:14.447 --> 34:16.483
Why go through the trouble
of getting press credentials

34:16.550 --> 34:17.783
if you're not gonna use them?

34:17.920 --> 34:19.456
Unless he's pulling another head fake.

34:20.690 --> 34:22.592
Like the encryption system

34:22.659 --> 34:24.293
was a cover for the theft of the toxin.

34:24.360 --> 34:25.860
Military tactics.

34:25.928 --> 34:28.230
Always making sure we're a step behind.

34:28.297 --> 34:30.065
A step behind what?

34:30.132 --> 34:31.533
I mean, this has to be about revenge,

34:31.601 --> 34:33.235
so it has to be about Reed.

34:33.303 --> 34:36.036
Maybe he wants to do to
Reed what Reed did to him...

34:36.106 --> 34:39.274
Take away the person he loves the most.

34:39.342 --> 34:40.775
His wife.

34:45.414 --> 34:49.484
(Tires screeching, engine revving)

34:54.089 --> 34:55.590
(Static crackles) Beckett,
why'd you turn around?

34:55.657 --> 34:57.190
Is it Castle?

34:57.258 --> 34:59.792
(Static crackles) No. We have a hunch.

34:59.860 --> 35:00.994
What kind of hunch?

35:01.061 --> 35:01.928
(Woman) Defense Secretary Reed's office.

35:01.996 --> 35:03.696
This is Agent Beckett

35:03.764 --> 35:04.464
- from the Attorney General's investigative...
- Hold, please.

35:04.532 --> 35:06.099
No, wait. Hello?

35:06.167 --> 35:07.867
Kate...

35:07.935 --> 35:10.370
Castle, just stay with
me. We're almost there.

35:12.140 --> 35:14.640
Hi. Brad Parker. Here for the interview.

35:14.707 --> 35:16.675
Mrs. Reed's expecting you.

35:16.743 --> 35:17.809
Thank you.

35:17.877 --> 35:19.845
(Gate clanks and creaks)

35:26.919 --> 35:28.287
(Engine revving)

35:31.624 --> 35:34.259
Defense Secretary Reed's
office. How can I help you?

35:34.326 --> 35:35.993
Excuse me, Mrs. Reed.

35:36.061 --> 35:37.295
Mr. Parker.

35:37.363 --> 35:38.896
Thanks, Julie.

35:38.964 --> 35:41.399
Please, make yourself
comfortable, Mr. Parker.

35:41.467 --> 35:43.201
Thank you, ma'am. (Briefcase thuds)

35:43.269 --> 35:46.170
Can I pour you some tea?

35:46.237 --> 35:49.239
(Cell phone rings)

35:49.307 --> 35:50.807
(Ring)

35:50.875 --> 35:52.376
Well, only if you're
having some. (Ring, beep)

35:52.443 --> 35:53.644
That's a deal.

35:53.711 --> 35:55.945
(Cell phone clatters) Do you take sugar?

35:56.013 --> 35:57.514
<i>(Beep) (Mrs. Reed's voice)
You've reached the Reeds.</i>

35:57.582 --> 35:59.883
<i>We're not available, so
please leave a message... </i>

35:59.950 --> 36:01.184
<i>- Come on. Damn it.
- And your call will be returned promptly.</i>

36:01.251 --> 36:04.353
- Kate...
- No, Castle, just look at me.

36:04.421 --> 36:05.888
Just hang on, okay?

36:05.955 --> 36:08.057
We're almost there.

36:10.282 --> 36:12.786
(Tires screech, engine revs)

36:19.602 --> 36:20.514
(Car door closes)

36:23.002 --> 36:25.570
Castle. No.

36:25.638 --> 36:29.006
No. Rick, look at me, will you?

36:33.111 --> 36:34.912
(Unholsters gun)

36:50.261 --> 36:52.862
Mrs. Reed?

36:53.020 --> 36:55.756
- She's not responding.
- (Parker) Send an ambulance.

36:55.823 --> 36:58.123
She's not breathing.
Parker, drop the phone.

36:58.191 --> 36:59.625
What are you doing?

36:59.693 --> 37:02.261
- Where's the antidote, Parker?
- (Gun cocks)

37:02.328 --> 37:04.530
- Lower your weapon.
- He poisoned Mrs. Reed.

37:04.598 --> 37:06.198
Stay with her.

37:10.704 --> 37:12.737
It's over, Parker!

37:12.805 --> 37:14.372
We know everything.

37:14.440 --> 37:18.710
Now give us the antidote
before it's too late.

37:28.853 --> 37:31.288
Uhh! Aah!

37:31.355 --> 37:33.657
- No, wait.
- Did Reed wait when he ordered the strike?

37:33.725 --> 37:38.161
- (Panting)
- No. No, now it's his turn to see how it feels.

37:38.229 --> 37:40.697
She's gonna die... just like Farrah.

37:40.765 --> 37:42.132
Please.

37:42.199 --> 37:44.567
Parker, she's not the only
one that you've poisoned.

37:44.635 --> 37:47.202
My fiancé's dying. He needs that antidote.

37:47.270 --> 37:50.072
No, you don't understand.

37:50.140 --> 37:52.975
Too late.

37:53.043 --> 37:54.343
- It's too late.
- (Gun cocks)

37:54.411 --> 37:56.779
You better hope you're wrong.

38:03.052 --> 38:04.619
(Beckett) Castle?

38:04.687 --> 38:07.522
(Monitor beeping steadily)

38:12.995 --> 38:13.895
Mm?

38:15.898 --> 38:17.164
(Whispers) Castle?

38:17.231 --> 38:19.934
Hmm?

38:21.937 --> 38:23.504
Hey.

38:23.572 --> 38:24.772
Hi.

38:24.840 --> 38:27.675
Hi.

38:27.742 --> 38:30.210
I had the strangest
dream, and you were there.

38:30.278 --> 38:32.245
Oh, thank God.

38:32.313 --> 38:33.746
Hi, dad.

38:33.814 --> 38:35.982
Hey, you were there, and you were there.

38:36.049 --> 38:37.550
Hey, Mr. C.

38:37.618 --> 38:40.186
I did some healing reiki on you.

38:40.253 --> 38:41.955
Looks like it worked.

38:42.022 --> 38:44.190
And you were there.

38:44.257 --> 38:46.459
(Laughs) I think he's gonna be all right.

38:46.527 --> 38:49.427
Yeah, thanks to you.

38:51.531 --> 38:53.098
(Sighs) Well, look, look,

38:53.165 --> 38:55.701
why don't we... why don't
we give you guys a moment?

38:55.768 --> 38:57.068
Come on.

38:57.136 --> 38:59.705
- We'll be outside if you need us.
- Okay.

38:59.772 --> 39:01.607
(Kisses) Love you.

39:01.674 --> 39:03.408
Love you, too.

39:03.476 --> 39:04.609
Mm.

39:04.676 --> 39:06.076
Hey.

39:06.144 --> 39:07.578
Hey.

39:07.646 --> 39:09.346
How was your weekend?

39:09.414 --> 39:12.583
Mm. You know, uneventful. Yours?

39:12.651 --> 39:13.784
Hmm.

39:13.852 --> 39:15.319
Same.

39:15.387 --> 39:16.921
Hmm.

39:16.989 --> 39:18.589
But at least I got to see you.

39:22.159 --> 39:23.827
I'm so sorry, Castle.

39:25.796 --> 39:29.432
This wasn't supposed to be this hard.

39:29.500 --> 39:32.201
What, Washington or us?

39:34.304 --> 39:36.572
Sometimes...

39:36.640 --> 39:38.507
the hardest things in life...

39:38.575 --> 39:41.710
are the things most worth doing.

39:43.279 --> 39:44.613
Just because we haven't figured it out yet

39:44.681 --> 39:46.415
doesn't mean we won't.

39:46.482 --> 39:49.885
Tell you what, though.

39:50.603 --> 39:51.736
Next time I say I'm dying to see you,

39:51.804 --> 39:53.904
let's keep it metaphoric.

39:53.971 --> 39:55.872
(Whispers) Deal.

39:55.940 --> 39:58.342
Hmm.

40:04.759 --> 40:06.560
(Telephone rings in distance)

40:06.808 --> 40:08.342
How's he doing?

40:08.410 --> 40:10.610
He's okay, considering.

40:10.678 --> 40:12.812
What about Mrs. Reed?

40:12.879 --> 40:15.415
Uh, she will pull through.

40:15.482 --> 40:17.417
And what about Secretary Reed?

40:17.484 --> 40:19.285
What's gonna happen with him?

40:19.353 --> 40:20.786
What do you mean?

40:20.854 --> 40:24.090
He withheld information
to save his own ass.

40:24.157 --> 40:26.725
People almost died because of it.

40:26.792 --> 40:28.993
Well, we both know it's not that simple.

40:29.061 --> 40:32.197
Well... there's gonna be an investigation,

40:32.265 --> 40:33.432
at least, right?

40:35.501 --> 40:39.538
You... want everything to
be black or white. I get it.

40:39.606 --> 40:42.973
But... in this town,

40:43.041 --> 40:44.975
it rarely is, and to do this job,

40:45.043 --> 40:47.945
you have to make peace with that.

40:48.012 --> 40:50.715
But hey...

40:50.782 --> 40:52.416
that was a hell of a hunch about Mrs. Reed.

40:54.786 --> 40:56.554
You should feel really good about this.

40:56.622 --> 40:58.054
Yeah, well, that was Castle.

40:58.122 --> 41:00.323
But you were smart enough to act on it.

41:00.391 --> 41:01.625
That was your call.

41:01.692 --> 41:05.995
And you backed me up
without even knowing my play.

41:06.063 --> 41:08.531
That's what partners do.

41:16.105 --> 41:18.274
(Under breath) Yeah.

41:18.341 --> 41:20.776
That's what partners do.
