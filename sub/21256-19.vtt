No. ICE can't make a

a recommendation to deny it.

11:39.376 --> 11:42.102
We both know the Sinfuegos got lucky.

11:42.112 --> 11:43.970
Very lucky.

11:43.980 --> 11:46.040
But most people in their situation

11:46.050 --> 11:48.675
don't have access to the
same resources that they did.

11:48.685 --> 11:50.010
You mean you?

11:50.020 --> 11:52.109
Listen, Callie, you've done
so much for them already.

11:52.120 --> 11:55.423
No. No, I meant you and
all the law students.

11:57.527 --> 12:01.587
But the people I wanna help
don't have time on their side.

12:01.597 --> 12:05.758
Like, think about how many families
could be torn apart in a year.

12:05.768 --> 12:08.694
How many kids could
have their lives ruined

12:08.704 --> 12:12.897
because of a legal system that is
completely stacked against them.

12:12.907 --> 12:14.899
Callie...

12:14.909 --> 12:16.809
you really are a force
of nature, you know that?

12:17.992 --> 12:19.438
This world's gonna be a better place

12:19.448 --> 12:21.051
with you out there
fighting for what's right.

12:21.062 --> 12:22.328
There's no doubt about that.

12:23.552 --> 12:27.053
And we would be very lucky to
have you in our law program.

12:28.422 --> 12:29.821
Now that being said,

12:30.857 --> 12:32.558
it's probably not
gonna happen this year.

12:55.659 --> 12:57.651
I'm really not in the
mood for another lecture

12:57.661 --> 12:59.220

12:59.230 --> 13:00.895
Well, I would like to, uh...

13:03.234 --> 13:04.866
I'd like to call a truce, please.

13:06.469 --> 13:08.961
I think that this has gone
on, uh, a little too long.

13:08.971 --> 13:10.296
I almost did something stupid.

13:10.306 --> 13:12.632
I almost put Patrick Molloy's
name on a warrant list

13:12.642 --> 13:14.133
without a judge's order.

13:14.143 --> 13:16.223
- That would have been stupid.
- I'm more than aware.

13:17.547 --> 13:19.046
I cannot afford to lose my job.

13:20.783 --> 13:22.774
So I, uh...

13:22.784 --> 13:25.110
just wanna let this
whole Molloy thing go.

13:25.120 --> 13:26.211
Wise decision.

13:26.221 --> 13:27.812
Thank you.

13:27.822 --> 13:30.257
I do need one thing from you, however.

13:32.026 --> 13:34.219
I need to know that you
will not go to IA on me,

13:34.229 --> 13:37.631
and I need to know that you will
leave Kyle Snow alone, please.

You don't narc on me,
I don't narc on you.

13:45.072 --> 13:46.664
I guess we're good.

13:46.674 --> 13:50.401
But honestly, Gray,
it doesn't bother you that you left

13:50.411 --> 13:52.236
a child molester on the street?

13:52.246 --> 13:53.771
Really?

13:53.781 --> 13:56.994
It would have bothered me a lot more
to leave a murderer on the street.

13:57.784 --> 13:59.049
You have to pick your battles.

14:01.621 --> 14:03.020
Fair enough.

14:04.957 --> 14:06.791
You can't win 'em all, right?

14:20.439 --> 14:22.063
You think that was enough?

14:22.073 --> 14:24.667
With your testimony? Absolutely.

14:24.677 --> 14:26.101
Hey...

14:26.111 --> 14:28.244

14:34.051 --> 14:35.677

14:37.689 --> 14:40.381

27:30.135 --> 27:33.328
I'm human and I'm
allowed to have feelings

27:33.338 --> 27:35.697

30:01.445 --> 30:03.844
Because I've been loved by you, Brandon.

35:31.529 --> 35:33.388
sometimes, what you need.

35:33.398 --> 35:35.423
Which might just be a kick in the ass.

35:35.433 --> 35:37.692
The trick is to enjoy the journey.

35:38.971 --> 35:41.671

depends on who you travel with.

considering she's an undergrad.

40:00.831 --> 40:02.719
Well, it... it's all
good. Don't worry about it.

40:02.730 --> 40:03.809
It's no big deal.

40:03.819 --> 40:06.611
No, it's your graduation.
It's totally a big deal.

40:06.621 --> 40:08.981
Don't you two have a big
deal you wanna talk about?

40:08.991 --> 40:10.950
Mariana, now is not the time.

40:10.960 --> 40:13.093
Come on. How often are we all together?

40:15.697 --> 40:16.697
It's up to you.

40:17.900 --> 40:20.491
Well, I mean, I don't want
to steal Jude's thunder.

40:20.501 --> 40:21.625

I helped Brandon pick it out
when he came to visit me in Boston.

JESUS: That's so cool.

40:39.586 --> 40:40.844
CALLIE: Isn't it beautiful?

40:40.854 --> 40:42.913
So, wh... when is this happening?

40:42.923 --> 40:45.682
I mean, we were thinking
maybe next summer.

40:45.692 --> 40:47.514
- Like a beach thing.

40:47.525 --> 40:49.253
Congratulations.

40:49.263 --> 40:51.529
Oh, my goodness.

STEF: I can't believe it.

40:55.268 --> 40:57.701

41:15.753 --> 41:17.578
Uh, it's Bill.

41:17.588 --> 41:19.614
Uh, the social worker, Bill.

41:19.624 --> 41:22.191
He has a kid who needs a home.

41:23.395 --> 41:25.085
