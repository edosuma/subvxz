Hey, Aud.
Hey...

00:07.925 --> 00:08.801
You.

00:12.429 --> 00:13.597
Jeff, you know Ana.

00:14.849 --> 00:15.933
(MOUTHING)

00:18.602 --> 00:19.311
She's been cleaning
for us for six months.

00:20.395 --> 00:21.313
She sure is dusting off
those cookies.

00:23.774 --> 00:24.399
Hola, Mr. Jeff.

00:25.400 --> 00:26.360
I have to apologize
for my socks.

00:27.152 --> 00:28.487
My feet sweat a lot but.

00:29.404 --> 00:30.781
I, uh... I guess
you knew that.

00:33.158 --> 00:34.201
Anyways, uh...

00:34.618 --> 00:35.285
Cerveza.

00:44.545 --> 00:45.671
We should get you
and that cleaning lady
a maid.

00:49.842 --> 00:50.592
Ana is more than
just a cleaning lady.

00:51.301 --> 00:51.677
She's become a friend.

00:52.260 --> 00:53.303
Oh, here we go.

00:54.137 --> 00:54.763
What?
She's here to work.

00:56.306 --> 00:57.349
If anybody should get pd
to sit and listen
to you yammer,

00:57.766 --> 00:58.684
it's me.

01:01.937 --> 01:02.897
First of all,
if anyone should
be compensated

01:03.772 --> 01:04.398
for this marriage,
it's me.

01:07.568 --> 01:08.360
I should get hazard pay
just for having to share
a bathroom with you.

01:11.030 --> 01:11.780
And honestly,
why do you even care

01:12.656 --> 01:13.574
if I sit and chat
with Ana?

01:15.492 --> 01:17.369
I'm just saying
that you don't have
to be best friends

01:18.328 --> 01:19.246
with everybody
who works for us.

01:19.830 --> 01:20.873
I don't do that.

01:22.123 --> 01:22.875
Then why am I going
to the doorman's weddin?

01:26.045 --> 01:26.921
I can't help it.
I'm a people person.

01:28.589 --> 01:29.297
Plus, Ana and I have
a very good Time togeth.

01:30.382 --> 01:31.174
You don't even speak
the same language.

01:32.718 --> 01:34.011
Oh, my Spanish is
a lot better than
you think it is, Jeff.

01:55.699 --> 01:56.909
What, uh...
what did she say?

01:58.243 --> 01:59.536
It's kind of a private .
It doesn't translate.

02:05.042 --> 02:07.168

Well, luckily, I didn't,
or it would be
all over the floor.

02:44.581 --> 02:45.624
Talk about a wood kille.

02:47.876 --> 02:49.837

03:24.705 --> 03:25.413
We motivate each other.

03:26.165 --> 03:26.748
I'd run pretty fast too,

03:28.083 --> 03:29.626
if I was being chased
by Mahatma Gumby over here.

03:33.547 --> 03:34.798
Okay. And on that note,
we really should get go.

03:37.300 --> 03:37.926
I used to run
a little bit.

03:38.510 --> 03:39.053
(SIGHS HEAVILY)

03:39.469 --> 03:40.054
Really?

03:40.929 --> 03:41.680
Yeah.

03:43.557 --> 03:45.184

03:45.600 --> 03:46.476
(SNIFFS)

03:48.228 --> 03:49.229
You did
an Ironman triathlon?

03:49.771 --> 03:50.647
Well, I, uh...

03:51.606 --> 03:52.066
I hit a theater seat
really hard

03:52.941 --> 03:54.275
when I went to see  Iron Ma.

03:55.986 --> 03:56.444
It was pretty bad.

03:57.278 --> 03:57.905
Hey, what's going on?
Hey.

03:58.906 --> 03:59.698
Ah, Mr. Rhodes.
This is Stephanie.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.075
Oh, hi.
Hi.

04:01.825 --> 04:02.951
Yeah.
Hey, guess what.

04:03.952 --> 04:05.370
I guess she's his
"running buddy."

04:07.497 --> 04:08.832
No air quotes.
That's literally
what she is.

04:11.626 --> 04:12.169
Timmy and I are training
for the marathon.

04:13.962 --> 04:15.380
Yes, completing a marathon
has long since been
a personal goal of mine,

04:16.548 --> 04:18.050
which I have so far been
unable to achieve.

04:19.176 --> 04:19.760
Hmm. Good luck
tottering around Manhatn

04:20.719 --> 04:21.887
on those Slim Jims
you call legs.

04:25.640 --> 04:27.101
Sir, your legs
look like two rolls

04:27.935 --> 04:28.685
of uncooked Pillsbury dough.

04:31.521 --> 04:32.898
Hey, the top-selling
pastry in America.

04:34.649 --> 04:35.901
You can't hurt me, Tim.

04:39.404 --> 04:40.197
Hey. You know, in high
school, I was co-captain
of my cross-country tea,

04:40.906 --> 04:42.116
till I pulled a groin.

04:43.825 --> 04:44.367
Oh, wow.
Whose was it?

04:45.244 --> 04:46.036
Yours or the
other captain's?

04:47.287 --> 04:48.163
Ha, ha.

04:49.330 --> 04:50.457
Nice try embarrassing m,
but it was mine.

04:52.417 --> 04:53.543
I pulled my own groin, .

04:56.755 --> 04:58.173
Well, if you want,
you should join us.

04:58.924 --> 04:59.299
ADAM: You know, I might.

05:00.383 --> 05:00.926
I've been meaning
to get back into it.

05:03.011 --> 05:03.262
Well, it might be
a bit late in the game.

05:04.345 --> 05:05.013
The marathon's
less than a month away.

05:06.140 --> 05:07.933
It doesn't matter.
Running is 90% mental.

05:09.143 --> 05:10.227
Anything you believe
you can do, you can do.

05:10.978 --> 05:11.603
Huh.
Come on, let's go.

05:12.312 --> 05:13.563
Hmm. Cheers.
Bye-bye.

05:15.356 --> 05:15.983
Wow.
Yeah.

05:16.733 --> 05:17.276
She really inspired me.

05:17.818 --> 05:18.359
Yeah, me too.

05:19.153 --> 05:19.569
I'm gonna run a maratho.

05:20.361 --> 05:20.946
I'm gonna nail Stephani.

05:28.078 --> 05:28.787
Oh.

05:31.123 --> 05:32.166
Oh, look at that.
You two are hugging now.

05:35.294 --> 05:36.003
We were just
saying good-bye, Jeff.

05:36.878 --> 05:38.088
Muchas gracias,

05:39.881 --> 05:41.300

05:47.264 --> 05:48.640
I'm not much of a, uh...
Here you go.

05:51.852 --> 05:53.103
All right.
All right, off you go.

05:55.396 --> 05:55.856
(EXHALES HEAVILY)

05:56.439 --> 05:57.191
Adios.
Adios.

05:58.525 --> 05:58.942
JEFF: What's, uh...

06:00.027 --> 06:01.028
What's with all the
"muchas gracias"?

06:03.071 --> 06:04.156
Uh, it means
"thank you very much."

06:05.991 --> 06:06.825
Yes, I knew that,
Rosetta Stone.

06:10.329 --> 06:13.165
What I meant was,
why is she thanking us?

06:15.000 --> 06:16.335
Well, we just did
something very generous.

06:18.212 --> 06:18.712
The second I saw you two
sharing cookies,

06:19.880 --> 06:20.672
I knew it would lead
straight to my wallet.

06:25.677 --> 06:27.221
Look, Ana needs
an operation, okay?

06:28.513 --> 06:29.890
I mean, you saw the way
she limped out of here.

06:31.016 --> 06:31.350
I just thought her leg
had fallen asleep

06:32.559 --> 06:33.601
from sitting around
listening to you  habla.

06:38.065 --> 06:39.649
That, uh...
that means "talk".

06:45.613 --> 06:47.157
Look, we are not gonna y
for the whole operation.

06:47.908 --> 06:49.034
I had a wonderful idea.

06:50.244 --> 06:51.286
She works for other
people in the building,

06:51.328 --> 06:51.870
so I'm gonna ask them
to chip in.

06:53.830 --> 06:55.498
I am bringing
the whole community togethe.

06:57.000 --> 06:57.542
Oh, I get it.
Now you just want
to show off to everyone,

06:58.417 --> 06:59.044
make 'em think
you're a hero.

07:00.712 --> 07:01.296
Oh, well, forgive me.

07:02.923 --> 07:04.674
Unlike you, I actually
like doing good things
for other people.

07:05.050 --> 07:06.260
Well.

07:07.052 --> 07:07.802
This isn't gonna end we.

07:12.515 --> 07:14.101
How is being the leader
of a charitable endeavor

07:14.809 --> 07:15.560
not going to end well?

07:16.103 --> 07:17.437
I don't know,

07:18.521 --> 07:19.356
but I look forward
to you showing me.

07:24.736 --> 07:25.695
Hey, if charity's your ,

07:27.948 --> 07:29.157
why not throw
a little this way, huh?

07:33.412 --> 07:35.122
Hey, I am happy
to contribute.

07:36.415 --> 07:36.998
I think it is so nice
what you're doing for A.

07:38.041 --> 07:39.167
Oh, I've heard
all the adjectives...

07:40.127 --> 07:42.170
Nice, noble,
generous, selfless.

07:43.213 --> 07:44.798
But honestly,
I'm just being Audrey.

07:46.425 --> 07:47.301
(DOOR OPENS)

07:49.219 --> 07:49.636
Hey, guys.
JENNIFER: Hey.

07:51.430 --> 07:52.597
Did you go for a run
or a swim?

07:53.014 --> 07:54.099
(LAUGHS)

07:55.434 --> 07:55.642
Oh, my God,
you guys are not
gonna believe this.

07:56.601 --> 07:57.936
Okay? According
to my pedometer,

07:59.020 --> 08:00.272
I just ran 30 miles
in a half an hour.

08:04.234 --> 08:05.068
Adam, you have it
on clock mode.

08:07.070 --> 08:08.863
You didn't run 30 miles.
You ran for 30 minutes.

08:11.574 --> 08:12.367
Yeah, but in
a half an hour.

08:16.163 --> 08:17.331
You know?
I mean, that's, like,
my personal best.

08:18.206 --> 08:18.999
Whew.

08:19.624 --> 08:21.335
Whoa.
(CHUCKLES)

08:22.377 --> 08:23.044
What's happening
with the band-aids?

08:24.838 --> 08:25.880
He says it's a runner t.

08:26.965 --> 08:27.507
(SIGHS) Yeah,
it prevents nip chafing.

08:30.677 --> 08:31.636
You know how sensitive
they can get.

08:34.973 --> 08:36.308
It's pretty smart, huh?

08:36.891 --> 08:37.725
(SCREAMS)
Oh.

08:39.478 --> 08:41.062
Oh! Ouch-less, my ass!

08:42.939 --> 08:43.731
(GROANS)

08:50.280 --> 08:50.947
So why did you finally agree
to have dinner with me?

08:52.073 --> 08:53.700
Was it the two weeks
of gentle stalking?

08:55.952 --> 08:57.245
Actually, it was you
emailing me as
my friend Caitlin,

08:58.288 --> 08:59.247
saying, "Meet me
at this restaurant."

09:00.957 --> 09:01.333
That was a good one, hu?

09:01.749 --> 09:02.417
(LAUGHS)

09:03.835 --> 09:06.546
Look, you're funny and e
in sort of an ironic wa.

09:08.048 --> 09:08.548
That's what I'm going f.

09:09.341 --> 09:10.217
Well, it's working.
Hmm.

09:11.343 --> 09:12.552
But you and I
are very different peop.

09:13.928 --> 09:16.014
Listen, we both put
our pants on
one leg at a time.

09:17.807 --> 09:19.017
Hopefully, you'll see
for yourself in the mor.

09:21.186 --> 09:22.103
None for me, thanks.
I got the marathon coming u.

09:23.021 --> 09:23.897
Then you need
to be hydrated.

09:24.731 --> 09:25.524
Or, as I like to call i,

09:26.066 --> 09:27.234
"wine-drated".

09:28.193 --> 09:31.196
Look, if this was
two years ago,

09:32.113 --> 09:33.407
it'd be a very
different story.

09:34.449 --> 09:35.783
Really? I'd like
to hear that story.

09:37.369 --> 09:39.329
Well, I used to be
a real party girl.

09:40.914 --> 09:42.332
Drinking,
staying out late...

09:42.957 --> 09:43.958
One-night stands.

09:44.876 --> 09:46.920
Oh, where did it
all go wrong?

09:49.464 --> 09:50.757
I just don't do
anything halfway.

09:52.592 --> 09:54.135
And these days,
I'm all about running
and training.

09:55.303 --> 09:56.471
Hmm.

09:57.514 --> 09:59.474
Well, I understand
and respect that.

10:01.642 --> 10:02.185
In fact,
let's drink to that.

10:09.109 --> 10:09.776
Oh, you going to the gy?

10:11.778 --> 10:13.321
Move over, Mentalist.
There's a new genius in tow.

10:18.701 --> 10:19.660
You can't go yet.
Ana's on her way over.

10:20.703 --> 10:21.162
Oh, good.
Well, it's been two wee.

10:21.871 --> 10:22.539
This place is a dump.

10:24.499 --> 10:25.542
She's not
coming to clean.

10:26.626 --> 10:27.502
She wants to thank us
for her surgery.

10:28.587 --> 10:28.962
She said she's still
a little swollen,

10:29.879 --> 10:30.464
but she sounded
really happy.

10:31.172 --> 10:31.965
Oh.
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

10:32.715 --> 10:33.967
That's probably her now.

10:37.971 --> 10:39.097
Hello, Audrey.
I have my check
for Ana's surgery.

10:40.014 --> 10:40.557
I'm sorry
I'm so late with it.

10:41.433 --> 10:41.849
Oh, no, no, no.
That's fine.

10:42.517 --> 10:43.101
I just went out back

10:44.436 --> 10:45.728
and plucked
a few more bills
off the money tree.

10:47.772 --> 10:48.648
Yeah, well,
I just wanted to say,

10:49.732 --> 10:51.067
I think that it is
so great how you...

10:51.943 --> 10:52.693
Spearheaded
the whole thing?

10:54.070 --> 10:54.821
Well, thank you,
but seriously,
if I hadn't done it,

10:55.989 --> 10:56.615
some other
big-hearted person
would have.

10:57.782 --> 10:59.033
Oh, Ana!

10:59.659 --> 11:01.077
Hola. Como estas?

11:01.786 --> 11:03.037
Muy bien, Miss Audrey.

11:03.371 --> 11:04.164
Oh.

11:06.207 --> 11:07.334
That means
she's doing very well.

11:08.042 --> 11:09.336
I speak Spanish so...

11:09.919 --> 11:10.711
Ana,  por favor.

11:11.129 --> 11:12.088
Ay, si.

11:15.467 --> 11:16.635
What's with the hitch
in her get-along?

11:19.262 --> 11:20.221
Thought we paid
to iron that out.

11:22.849 --> 11:23.933
Maybe it's still healin.

11:24.434 --> 11:25.268
Oh, my God.

11:35.403 --> 11:36.321
I definitely see
some swelling.

11:39.658 --> 11:41.909
Muchas gracias,
Miss Audrey  y Mr. Jeff.

11:42.494 --> 11:43.495
Muchas gracias.

11:46.540 --> 11:47.374
De nada.

11:49.959 --> 11:50.418
Well, you know,
I had my doubts.

11:51.461 --> 11:52.212
But you did good.
Hey. Bring it in.

11:53.463 --> 11:53.963
Bring it in.

12:06.725 --> 12:07.602
Oh, my God.

12:08.769 --> 12:09.770
I am so full.

12:14.192 --> 12:15.360
Here's an idea.
Why don't you stop eati?

12:16.861 --> 12:17.736
I'm carbo-loading.

12:18.613 --> 12:19.531
Got the marathon
in an hour.

12:26.037 --> 12:26.580
Wait, aren't you
supposed to do that
the night before?

12:27.746 --> 12:29.249
Aud, who ran cross-couny
in high school?

12:31.251 --> 12:32.126
I did.

12:33.878 --> 12:34.879
That makes this
a little less dramatic,

12:35.422 --> 12:36.172
but so did I.

12:40.343 --> 12:41.636
Hey, Timmy.
Ready for your race?

12:42.845 --> 12:43.888
Actually, I've run into
a bit of a problem.

12:44.972 --> 12:46.099
I haven't heard from
Stephanie in days.

12:46.933 --> 12:47.601
You try looking
in me bed?

12:51.187 --> 12:52.188
That's the last place
I saw her.

12:54.232 --> 12:55.734
If she's not there,
try me shower.

12:57.652 --> 12:58.069
If she's not there...

12:59.028 --> 12:59.778
Ugh, okay.
We get it, we get it.

13:00.947 --> 13:01.989
Hey, hey, whoa, whoa.
We don't all get it.

13:06.827 --> 13:08.455
I can't believe
you slept with Stephani.

13:09.163 --> 13:10.457
Oh, now we all get it.

13:14.127 --> 13:14.961
I should've known
meeting you would tempt her
back to the dark side.

13:15.920 --> 13:16.713
(CHUCKLES)
You really should've.

13:19.215 --> 13:20.091
Why would you
do this to me, sir?

13:21.342 --> 13:22.510
I don't know, Tim.
Why does anyone do anything?

13:23.844 --> 13:24.679
Why does Audrey want her mad
to have huge boobs?

13:25.221 --> 13:26.139
I don't know.

13:30.017 --> 13:31.060
I didn't want her
to have huge boobs, oka?

13:32.103 --> 13:32.395
I thought I was doing
a good thing.

13:33.354 --> 13:34.481
I thought I was fixing
her limp.

13:35.148 --> 13:35.732
Well, ironically,

13:36.733 --> 13:37.900
with all that extra
weight up top,

13:40.153 --> 13:41.321
that limp is
worse than ever.

13:45.992 --> 13:47.619
Six months of training
down the drain.

13:49.078 --> 13:49.788
Well, why can't you
do it by yourself?

13:51.205 --> 13:52.248
I've tried, Miss Morgan,
many a time.

13:53.792 --> 13:55.126
But without someone
setting the pace,
pushing me forward,

13:57.504 --> 13:58.837
I fear I may never reach
this lifelong goal.

13:59.673 --> 14:00.381
I'll be your running bu.

14:02.008 --> 14:02.676
Well, there's always
next year.

14:05.136 --> 14:06.137
Hey, come on.
Come on, Tim.
You've come this far.

14:08.139 --> 14:08.889
Well, I suppose
I've got nothing to los.

14:09.516 --> 14:10.016
That's the spirit.

14:11.058 --> 14:11.685
Now let's get
some pancakes in you.

14:14.813 --> 14:15.522
Mr. Rhodes,
you do know

14:17.148 --> 14:18.065
that you're supposed
to carbo-load
the night before the ra.

14:18.483 --> 14:19.984
Um, Tim,

14:21.068 --> 14:22.779
who ran cross-country
in high school?

14:23.154 --> 14:23.946
I did.

14:26.491 --> 14:27.492
God, I gotta stop
asking that question.

14:36.793 --> 14:37.544
(EXHALES)

14:38.294 --> 14:39.295
You ready?
You tell me.

14:40.338 --> 14:41.255
Whoa. All right, then.

14:42.215 --> 14:42.923
Feel free to leave,
imagination.

14:43.633 --> 14:44.425
Won't be needing you.

14:46.427 --> 14:47.554
Going to go
and text Stephanie
one more time.

14:48.929 --> 14:49.514
Hey, Timmy, look, I dont
think she's coming, bud.

14:50.682 --> 14:51.057
Okay?
And if we're gonna
win this thing,

14:51.641 --> 14:52.559
you gotta focus.

14:53.267 --> 14:54.060
I'm sorry... Win this?

14:55.895 --> 14:56.396
I'm merely hoping
to finish in under
five hours.

14:57.313 --> 14:58.314
We have no chance
of winning.

14:59.482 --> 15:00.483
Not with that negative
attitude, you don't.

15:01.568 --> 15:01.818
You know what, Timmy?
I'm sorry, man.

15:02.736 --> 15:03.236
But I'm in it to win it,
okay?

15:04.696 --> 15:05.446
And I don't think I canl
with your bring-down 't.

15:06.947 --> 15:08.157
So...run hard.

15:13.747 --> 15:14.497
Hey, whoa, Tim.

15:15.415 --> 15:16.207
Hey.
Sir.

15:18.125 --> 15:18.710
What on Earth
are you doing here?

15:19.836 --> 15:20.754
I found Stephanie.
Really? Where is she?

15:21.796 --> 15:22.922
Okay, she's in Vegas.
Oh, bollocks.

15:23.506 --> 15:24.090
But don't worry.

15:25.383 --> 15:26.050
We're definitely hookinp
when she comes back.

15:26.885 --> 15:27.719
Terrific.
Where you going?

15:30.388 --> 15:31.305
I can't do this
on my own, sir.

15:33.140 --> 15:34.392
I'm giving up.
No, no.

15:35.184 --> 15:36.143
Giving up?
Tim, come on.

15:36.770 --> 15:37.687
You've set a goal.

15:38.897 --> 15:40.106
And if you can dream it,
you can achieve it.

15:40.940 --> 15:41.649
I mean,
look at me, buddy.

15:42.776 --> 15:43.818
My goal was to bang
your running buddy.

15:44.444 --> 15:45.820
Was that easy? No.

15:46.946 --> 15:48.239
Were there times
I thought of giving up?

15:49.407 --> 15:50.991
Sure. But I didn't.
And I reached my goal.

15:51.743 --> 15:52.577
Twice.

15:54.537 --> 15:55.204
And you can too.

15:57.832 --> 15:58.374
Reprehensible...

15:59.834 --> 16:01.127
yet oddly inspiring.

16:01.502 --> 16:02.211
Okay.

16:04.297 --> 16:05.381
Whoa, you're running
on those Tootsie Rolls?

16:06.340 --> 16:07.216
Good luck.

16:12.764 --> 16:13.556
(HUFFING)

16:16.601 --> 16:17.143
What's up, dudes?

16:18.728 --> 16:19.520
Yeah, you guys look
like you're ready
to get your 'thon on.

16:20.313 --> 16:21.147
Hey, mind if I tag alon?

16:22.482 --> 16:23.023
You know,
I ran cross-country
in high school.

16:23.858 --> 16:24.358
I'm sure you guys did, .

16:24.984 --> 16:25.860
(GUNSHOT)
Whoa!

16:27.111 --> 16:27.987
Hey, where's the fire?

16:28.905 --> 16:29.989
You know
it's 26 miles, right?

16:36.621 --> 16:37.455
(SIGHS)
Please calm down,
Mrs. Morris.

16:38.539 --> 16:39.582
I'm going to refund
everyone's money.

16:41.459 --> 16:42.293
(SIGHS)

16:43.586 --> 16:45.254
Wow.
Well, that's some pretty
colorful language

16:45.922 --> 16:46.631
for a gal your age.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.136
Well, you definitely brt
the building together.

16:52.762 --> 16:54.013
Everybody agrees.

16:55.055 --> 16:56.015
They hate you.

17:00.144 --> 17:01.604
I just wanted
to feel appreciated.

17:02.438 --> 17:03.523
Well, maybe this will h.

17:05.149 --> 17:06.359
"Dear Miss Audrey,
I am very sorry
about the misunderstanding,

17:07.861 --> 17:09.403
"but please know
that your generosity
has changed my life.

17:10.196 --> 17:10.571
"I have never been happr

17:11.739 --> 17:12.490
"and can't wait
to wake up each morning"

17:13.825 --> 17:14.826
Ohh.

17:16.202 --> 17:17.328
That's so nice of Ana.

17:18.245 --> 17:19.121
It's from
her husband Carlos.

17:25.503 --> 17:26.128
You know what?
I'll take it.

17:28.255 --> 17:29.048
Now.

17:30.090 --> 17:31.384
If you're still
feeling generous...

17:38.140 --> 17:38.725
ADAM:
Where the hell
did those Kenyans go?

17:39.350 --> 17:40.434
Oh, God.
Cramps!

17:41.435 --> 17:42.311
(GROANING)

17:43.187 --> 17:44.230
Stupid pancakes.

17:45.690 --> 17:46.482
(PEOPLE CHEERING)

17:49.485 --> 17:49.903
TIMMY:
Mr. Dunbar was right.

17:50.444 --> 17:50.987
I can do this.

17:51.988 --> 17:52.947
I've worked hard.
I've prepared.

17:54.073 --> 17:55.282
I am the only thing
standing in my way.

17:55.616 --> 17:56.492
Oh!

17:57.035 --> 17:58.160
(CROWD GASPS)

17:58.661 --> 17:59.245
Oh, my knee!

17:59.954 --> 18:01.080
My knee...
(GROANING)

18:01.831 --> 18:02.498
Hey, Timmy.

18:02.832 --> 18:03.666
Hey.

18:04.751 --> 18:05.501
Don't worry.

18:06.419 --> 18:07.045
I got a band-aid.

18:09.881 --> 18:10.548
(SCREAMS)

18:11.131 --> 18:12.216
(BOTH GROANING)

18:16.971 --> 18:18.180
Hey, don't feel bad.

18:19.682 --> 18:20.767
You haven't run a maratn
in over ten years,
so you know,

18:21.601 --> 18:23.019
1,100 yards isn't that .

18:26.355 --> 18:27.565
Yeah, I guess.

18:28.608 --> 18:29.275
And the Kenyans
finished top three,

18:30.234 --> 18:30.985
so our team had
a good showing.

18:35.155 --> 18:36.156
I would've been happy
just to have finished.

18:37.241 --> 18:38.242
Well, if it makes
you feel any better,

18:39.035 --> 18:40.078
when I was with Stephan,

18:40.578 --> 18:41.454
I finished.

18:44.624 --> 18:45.917
I'm sure she didn't.

18:47.961 --> 18:48.878
That's not really
my business.

18:53.299 --> 18:53.800
You guys got
your food to go?

18:55.426 --> 18:56.594
Uh, yeah,
we're gonna eat upstairs

18:57.386 --> 18:57.804
while we watch somethin.

18:58.554 --> 18:59.388
Yeah.
See you, girls.

18:59.806 --> 19:00.556
Mmm-hmm.

19:08.522 --> 19:09.482
This table,  por favor.

19:18.699 --> 19:19.575
Maybe under there.
