WEBVTT

00:00.300 --> 00:01.567
PREVIOUSLY ON <i>THE SHIELD...</i>

00:01.634 --> 00:04.300
MY DETECTIVE FOUND
12 BODIES HACKED TO PIECES.

00:04.367 --> 00:06.134
MACHETE'S A WEAPON OF CHOICE
FOR THE SALVADORANS.

00:06.200 --> 00:08.467
WHICH SUPPORTS THE TIP
THAT ACEVEDA'S CRONIES

00:08.534 --> 00:11.001
GAVE US THAT THE KILLERS
WERE SALVADORANS.

00:11.068 --> 00:12.634
THE VICTIMS WERE
ALL MEXICAN ILLEGALS.

00:12.701 --> 00:14.333
SOLVING IT QUICKLY
IS THE DIFFERENCE

00:14.400 --> 00:16.934
BETWEEN KEEPING THE BARN
OPEN OR CLOSING IT FOR GOOD.

00:17.200 --> 00:19.251
SALVADORAN BANG HAS
SPONSORED THIS FAIR.

00:19.568 --> 00:22.300
THIS LOOKS LIKE
RETALIATION FOR THE SAN
MARCOS HOUSE MURDERS.

00:22.367 --> 00:23.434
THAT'S HERNAN
IN THE BLUE SHIRT.

00:23.500 --> 00:25.434
I.C.E. HAS AN UNDERCOVER
OPERATIVE HIGH UP

00:25.500 --> 00:28.434
IN THE SALVADORAN FOOD CHAIN
I NEED TO PROTECT.

00:28.500 --> 00:31.001
THERE'S AN OPERATIVE
INSIDE THE SALVADORANS

00:31.068 --> 00:32.667
WHO CAN HELP SOLVE
THE SAN MARCOS
HOUSE MURDERS.

00:32.734 --> 00:34.001
YOU KNOW WHO
THE SALVADORANS WERE

00:34.068 --> 00:36.233
WHO WERE SWINGING
THE MACHETES AT SAN MARCOS?

00:36.300 --> 00:38.267
IT WOULD MEAN
DEATH TO MY COVER
IF I STARTED ASKING.

00:38.333 --> 00:39.734
SALVADORANS
ARE CLOSING RANKS.

00:39.801 --> 00:41.434
IT'S GETTING TOO
DANGEROUS FOR YOU
TO BE OUT THERE.

00:41.500 --> 00:42.384
WHERE'S HERNAN?

00:42.701 --> 00:43.834
WE LOST CONTACT
WITH HIM.

00:43.901 --> 00:45.601
ANYWAY
YOU GUYS COULD HAVE
COMPROMISED HIS COVER?

00:45.867 --> 00:46.801
DID YOU TALK TO SHANE?

00:46.867 --> 00:47.934
HE KILLED LEM.

00:48.001 --> 00:49.834
I DID WHAT I THOUGHT HAD
TO BE DONE AT THE TIME.

00:49.901 --> 00:52.534
I SEE YOU AGAIN,
I WILL KILL YOU.

00:52.600 --> 00:57.034
VIC WANTED TO KNOW
HOW BEN GOT A HOLD
OF CASH DOWN IN MEXICO.

00:57.101 --> 00:58.684
VENDRELL CAME
BY TODAY. HE WANTED
THE SAME INFORMATION.

00:58.950 --> 01:01.068
WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET
YOU GET HURT OVER THIS.

01:01.134 --> 01:02.334
WE GOT TO GET
OUT OF L.A.

01:02.500 --> 01:03.600
I'LL SQUIRREL ENOUGH AWAY

01:03.667 --> 01:04.500
SO WE CAN GET OUT OF HERE.

01:04.667 --> 01:07.801
JUST IMAGINE EVERY WRONG
THING WE HAVE EVER DONE.

01:07.867 --> 01:10.901
ANYTHING HAPPENS TO ME,
OR MY WIFE, OR MY SON...

01:12.168 --> 01:13.400
THAT LANDS
ON I.A.B.'s DOORSTEP.

01:13.917 --> 01:16.150
TELL KESAKIAN
I GOT A BUSINESS
PROPOSITION FOR HIM.

01:16.217 --> 01:17.850
I'M A COP. HE'S GOING
TO NEED TO KNOW.

01:17.917 --> 01:18.767
I'M AN ASSOCIATE.

01:19.734 --> 01:21.132
MAN, I SAID I WANTED
TO SPEAK TO KESAKIAN.

01:21.133 --> 01:22.867
BUT WHY? SINCE WE HAD
THE GOOD RELATIONSHIP

01:22.934 --> 01:23.767
WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT.

01:23.834 --> 01:25.034
THAT'S FUNNY,
I'M A FIXER.

01:25.100 --> 01:26.934
THERE'S
A NEW GAS STATION
ON TALLMADGE.

01:27.001 --> 01:29.068
THE ARMENIANS, DID
THEY PUT YOU UP TO THIS?

01:29.133 --> 01:30.068
AAH!

01:30.133 --> 01:31.400
THE SUPPLIER WILL
BE HERE TOMORROW

01:31.467 --> 01:32.500
TO FILL UP
ALL YOUR TANKS.

01:36.001 --> 01:39.500

02:26.093 --> 02:28.392
P.A.: RESPIRATORY THERAPIST,
CALL C.C.U.

02:29.459 --> 02:31.443
RESPIRATORY THERAPIST,
CALL C.C.U.

02:32.010 --> 02:33.476
THINK YOU COULD...

02:44.976 --> 02:47.560
YOU STAY STRONG, PAPA.

02:53.243 --> 02:55.393
YOU NEED TO FINISH
YOUR ENGLISH LESSONS.

03:00.709 --> 03:02.509
I CAN ONLY STAY
FOR A FEW MINUTES

03:02.576 --> 03:03.577
BUT I BROUGHT
YOU THIS...

03:05.542 --> 03:06.943
TO REMIND YOU
OF THE COLORS

03:07.010 --> 03:09.110
IN THE GARDEN
BACK IN REVIAN.

03:39.276 --> 03:40.343
CAN I HELP YOU?

03:40.410 --> 03:41.843
I NEED TO SPEAK
TO KESAKIAN.

03:41.909 --> 03:43.743
HE'S SUPPOSED TO HAVE
AN OFFICE HERE.

03:43.809 --> 03:45.709
HE'S NOT HERE.

03:45.776 --> 03:47.943
LOOK, I'VE SQUEEZED EVERY
FOOD STAMP COLLECTING,

03:48.010 --> 03:49.943
BENZ DRIVING ARMENIAN
FROM HERE TO GLENDALE.

03:50.010 --> 03:51.743
NOW, THIS IS WHERE
HE WORKS OUT OF

03:51.809 --> 03:53.710
AND I'M NOT LEAVING UNTIL
I GET A LITTLE FACE TIME.

03:54.477 --> 03:56.057
NOW, DO WE UNDERSTAND
EACH OTHER, SWEETIE?

03:58.576 --> 03:59.976
THIS WAY, PLEASE.

04:09.443 --> 04:10.609
TAKE A SEAT.

04:16.875 --> 04:17.942
I'M KESAKIAN.

04:18.010 --> 04:19.377
LOOK, I'VE GOT MY NUTS
IN A RINGER RIGHT NOW

04:19.442 --> 04:22.110
AND I DON'T LIKE
IT WHEN PEOPLE CRANK
THE HANDLE, OK?

04:22.176 --> 04:24.210
I NEED TO SPEAK
TO THE REAL KESAKIAN.

04:24.276 --> 04:26.642
MY FATHER'S OUT OF TOWN,

04:26.709 --> 04:29.043
BUT ANYTHING YOU NEED
TO DISCUSS WITH HIM,

04:29.110 --> 04:30.210
YOU CAN DISCUS WITH ME.

04:30.276 --> 04:31.542
I'M HANDLING HIS AFFAIRS.

04:31.609 --> 04:33.909
WELL, THEN YOU
PASS THIS MESSAGE
ALONG TO POPS, OK.

04:33.976 --> 04:36.477
I DIDN'T SIGN UP
TO BE WALKED INTO
A MURDER JACKPOT,

04:36.542 --> 04:38.642
AND HE BETTER
GODDAMN WELL FIX IT.

04:38.709 --> 04:39.510
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

04:39.527 --> 04:40.560
YOUR OLD MAN WILL.

04:40.827 --> 04:42.743
LOOK, REZIAN HAD ME
RUNNING ERRANDS
FOR YOU PEOPLE

04:42.809 --> 04:44.076
BY ME DRUMMING UP BUSINESS

04:44.143 --> 04:44.965
FOR YOUR GAS DELIVERY
OPERATION.

04:45.276 --> 04:47.210
YES, I MANAGE
THE BOOKS FOR THE--

04:47.276 --> 04:49.343
YEAH, WELL,
THE OWNER WOUND UP DEAD

04:49.410 --> 04:51.076
WITH A GUT FULL
OF SUPER UNLEADED.

04:51.143 --> 04:53.477
THAT SHIT GOES BACK ON ME,
FOR CHRIST'S SAKES.

04:53.542 --> 04:55.076
PLEASE, THIS
IS A HOLY PLACE.

04:55.143 --> 04:56.509
WELL, JESUS CAN KISS MY ASS.

04:56.576 --> 04:57.909
IF THAT FAGGOT REZIAN
NEEDED A GODDAMN PATSY

04:57.976 --> 04:59.038
TO PIN A MURDER ON,

04:59.088 --> 05:01.393
HE JUST FOUND HIMSELF
IN THE BUSINESS END
OF A HOLLOW POINT.

05:01.509 --> 05:03.809
YOU TAKING
MENTAL DICTATION?

05:03.876 --> 05:06.976
WE SHOULD TAKE
THIS CONVERSATION
ACROSS THE STREET.

05:08.377 --> 05:10.576
YOU KNOW WHAT
YOUR DADDY AND HIS CREW
DO FOR A LIVING?

05:10.642 --> 05:12.943
THEY'RE
STONE COLD GANGSTERS.

05:14.410 --> 05:17.053
I KNOW WHAT MY FATHER WAS.

05:17.410 --> 05:19.776
HE CAME HERE
FROM ARMENIA LAST YEAR.

05:19.843 --> 05:22.310
HE ASKED ME TO GIVE UP
MY STUDIES IN BERLIN

05:22.377 --> 05:24.477
TO COME HERE
AND HELP TRANSLATE.

05:24.542 --> 05:28.547
THAT'S HOW I KNOW
THAT ALL OUR TRANSACTIONS
HAS BEEN LEGAL.

05:28.726 --> 05:30.971
JUST BECAUSE PEOPLE
HAVEN'T BEEN GETTING
THEIR FEET CHOPPED OFF LATELY

05:31.126 --> 05:33.843
DOESN'T GET
THE ARMENIAN MOB INTO
THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE.

05:36.609 --> 05:39.076
I'LL SPEAK TO MY FATHER
AND I WILL ASK HIM

05:39.143 --> 05:40.676
TO LOOK INTO WHAT HAPPENED
AT THE GAS STATION.

05:40.743 --> 05:43.043
HEY, YOU TELL
YOUR OLD MAN TO TAKE
CARE OF MY PROBLEM

05:43.110 --> 05:46.060
OR I WILL CREATE A WORLD
OF PROBLEMS FOR HIM.

05:55.576 --> 05:56.326
YOU CALL?

05:58.143 --> 05:58.993
WHAT'S UP?

05:59.010 --> 06:00.743
WHY DON'T
YOU TWO TELL ME?

06:03.276 --> 06:05.976
I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO LOSE SOMEONE CLOSE,

06:06.043 --> 06:07.477
BUT THE DANCE YOU TWO
HAVE BEEN DOING

06:07.542 --> 06:09.327
IS ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE
AND I WANT TO KNOW WHAT.

06:12.010 --> 06:13.809
I'M NOT SURE
I CATCH YOUR DRIFT.

06:13.876 --> 06:17.743
YOU'VE BEEN HOUNDING
NANCY GILROY ABOUT BEN'S
MEXICAN HOOK-UPS

06:18.310 --> 06:19.776
AND I'VE THREATENED
TO CHARGE HER WITH AIDING
AND ABETTING

06:19.843 --> 06:21.243
 IF SHE DOESN'T TELL THE TRUTH.

06:21.310 --> 06:23.243
WHAT'S SO IMPORTANT
ABOUT THESE CONTACTS?

06:23.310 --> 06:24.976
IN A CASE THAT'S BEEN
CLOSED FOR OVER A YEAR.

06:25.743 --> 06:27.143
SHE AND I HAD A CONVERSATION.

06:27.210 --> 06:29.143
I THINK WITH YOUR APPEALS
HEARING COMING UP,

06:29.210 --> 06:32.326
YOU'D BE MORE HELPFUL
IF YOU'RE INTERESTED
IN SAVING YOUR JOB.

06:33.943 --> 06:35.310
WHAT WERE YOU AFTER?

06:35.377 --> 06:37.210
LEM'S KILLER.

06:37.276 --> 06:38.642
LEM WAS ON THE RUN.

06:38.709 --> 06:40.943
HE KNEW ABOUT GILROY'S
UNDERGROUND RAILROAD
TO MARGARITA VILLE.

06:41.010 --> 06:42.943
I THOUGHT SOMETHING
MIGHT HAVE GONE SIDEWAYS
IN THAT REGARD.

06:43.010 --> 06:45.276
COYOTE PULLING
A DOUBLE CROSS,
I DON'T KNOW.

06:46.743 --> 06:47.609
IT'S A BIT
OF A STRETCH.

06:47.676 --> 06:50.677
ACEVEDA'S HAD YOU DETAILED
TO HIS DEAD MEXICAN HAT DANCE.

06:51.443 --> 06:52.642
SOUNDS LIKE YOU
AND DUTCH HAVE DONE

06:52.709 --> 06:54.576
A WHOLE HELL OF A LOT
OF FINDING LEM'S KILLER.

06:54.642 --> 06:57.404
DON'T EVER USE A TONE
LIKE THAT TO ME AGAIN.

06:59.676 --> 07:02.081
TRANSFER COMES THROUGH SOON,
IT WON'T BE AN ISSUE.

07:05.343 --> 07:08.158
MY OPPER'S BEEN DARK
FOR 36 HOURS.

07:08.509 --> 07:11.143
SINCE YOU DEBRIEFED HERNAN
WITHOUT AUTHORIZATION

07:11.210 --> 07:13.719
I HAVE TO ASSUME THAT HIS
COVER'S BEEN COMPROMISED.

07:13.720 --> 07:15.676
WE DON'T KNOW THAT
WITH ANY CERTAINTY.

07:15.743 --> 07:16.976
HE CALLED IN DISTRESSED.

07:17.043 --> 07:18.210
HE DIDN'T SHOW UP TO A MEET.

07:18.276 --> 07:19.876
WHAT ARE YOU PEOPLE
DOING TO LOCATE HIM?

07:19.943 --> 07:23.676
WE'VE BEEN SITTING ON
HIS GIRLFRIEND'S PLACE
FOR THE LAST 24 HOURS.

07:23.743 --> 07:25.559
ALSO WE'RE RUNNING
SURVEILLANCE ON HIS
SALVADORAN ASSOCIATES.

07:26.776 --> 07:29.709
MY STATUS REPORT TO THE
BUREAU CHIEF ASSIGNS
ACCOUNTABILITY

07:29.776 --> 07:31.743
TO YOU AND
YOUR PERSONNEL.

07:31.809 --> 07:33.143
CONSIDER YOURSELF NOTIFIED.

07:33.210 --> 07:35.243
NICE. 10:42 A.M.,

07:35.310 --> 07:38.576
IN CASE YOU
NEED A TIME STAMP
FOR YOUR ASS-COVER MEMO.

07:40.076 --> 07:42.210
IF HERNAN'S STILL IN PLAY,

07:42.276 --> 07:47.659
YOU WILL REPORT ANY
AND ALL CONTACT WITH HIM
TO MY OFFICE IMMEDIATELY.

07:53.876 --> 07:57.843
I SEE NOW WHY HERNAN
REACHES OUT TO US
INSTEAD OF HIS HANDLERS.

07:58.060 --> 07:59.216
SHOULDN'T HAVE
INSERTED OURSELVES

07:59.243 --> 08:01.909
INTO A LONG-TERM
FEDERAL INVESTIGATION
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

08:01.976 --> 08:04.110
HERNAN CAN HELP US BREAK
THESE SAN MARCOS KILLINGS.

08:04.176 --> 08:06.876
WHO ELSE, BESIDES OUR TEAM,
KNEW ABOUT HERNAN'S COVER?

08:06.943 --> 08:09.509
STARCHMY, THAT'S IT.

08:09.576 --> 08:10.609
THAT'S IT?

08:10.676 --> 08:12.310
HERNAN CAN TAKE
CARE OF HIMSELF.

08:12.377 --> 08:14.043
STILL, WE NEED TO BE
ABLE TO THROW HIM

08:14.110 --> 08:17.543
A ROPE IF NECESSARY,
AND RIGHT NOW HE'S M.I.A.

08:19.377 --> 08:20.943
STIR UP THE WATERS
LOOKING FOR HERNAN,

08:21.010 --> 08:22.410
WE RISK PUTTING HIM
IN A WORSE SPOT.

08:22.477 --> 08:23.876
WE GOT RUN
A PASSIVE SEARCH.

08:23.943 --> 08:24.943
MAKE SOME BANK SHOTS;

08:25.010 --> 08:26.110
SEE WHAT BOUNCES
OFF OF WHAT.

08:26.176 --> 08:27.743
ANYTHING TURN UP AT
HERNAN'S GIRLFRIEND'S?

08:27.809 --> 08:29.310
NO. SAT UP AT HER HOUSE
ALL NIGHT AND THIS MORNING.

08:29.377 --> 08:30.377
SHE WAS A NO-SHOW.

08:30.443 --> 08:31.676
IT WASN'T A COMPLETE WASTE
SURVEILLANCE-WISE.

08:31.743 --> 08:33.693
SHE DOES DO
YOGA IN THE NUDE
WITH THE BLINDS OPEN.

08:34.308 --> 08:37.091
AH, THAT REALLY WORRIES ME.
HERNAN NOT SHOWING UP
AT HOME FOR THAT.

08:37.743 --> 08:38.876
I SAY WE WORK
THE OTHER SIDE
OF THE STREET.

08:38.943 --> 08:39.909
TALK TO THE BYZ LATS.

08:39.976 --> 08:41.409
TRUCE ISN'T HOLDING.

08:41.477 --> 08:42.808
IT'S POSSIBLE
HERNAN GOT CAUGHT UP

08:42.876 --> 08:44.076
IN ANOTHER ROUND
OF RETALIATION.

08:44.143 --> 08:45.809
RONNY AND I WILL HAVE
A SIT-DOWN WITH SANTI.

08:45.876 --> 08:46.709
TAKE SHANE
TO BACK YOU UP.

08:46.776 --> 08:47.576
NO, NO.
WE DON'T NEED HIM.

08:48.343 --> 08:51.319
UM, SHANE HAS A HISTORY
WITH THE BYZ LATS.
COULD GET IN THE WAY.

08:52.276 --> 08:54.926
OK, JOEY AND I--WE'LL GO
PESTER THE SALVADORANS,

08:54.993 --> 08:55.760
SPREAD THE LOVE AROUND.

08:56.377 --> 08:57.310
HEY, VIC?

08:57.377 --> 08:59.293
I GOT TO WORRY
ABOUT YOU AND SHANE?

08:59.410 --> 09:00.343
NO.

09:00.410 --> 09:01.693
THANKS FOR YOUR
CONCERN THOUGH.

09:05.843 --> 09:06.976
LOOK, MAN.

09:07.043 --> 09:09.876
I CAN'T FORGIVE SHANE
FOR WHAT HE DID,

09:09.943 --> 09:10.943
BUT TAKING
THIS BEEF PUBLIC?

09:11.010 --> 09:12.443
I KNOW, I KNOW.

09:12.509 --> 09:14.110
JUST TOUGH KEEPING
A POKER FACE WITH SHANE

09:14.176 --> 09:16.377
PLAYING OFF OF LEM'S
MURDER LIKE HE'S
TRYING TO SOLVE IT.

09:16.443 --> 09:18.709
WELL, THEN YOU NEED
TO KEEP YOUR ANGER
IN THE CUT.

09:18.776 --> 09:20.410
WE'RE NOT CLEAN
IN THIS EITHER,

09:20.477 --> 09:22.959
AND I'M NOT SPENDING
THE REST OF MY LIFE
WEARING STATE PROPERTY.

09:23.576 --> 09:25.343
THAT MAKES
TWO OF US.

09:26.510 --> 09:31.210

09:47.676 --> 09:49.035
SANTI IN HIS RAT HOLE?

09:49.378 --> 09:50.609
THOUGHT I SMELLED BACON.

09:51.226 --> 09:53.493
THAT KEEN RODENT
SENSE OF SMELL.

09:54.410 --> 09:56.710
CAME BY TO MAKE SURE
YOU AIN'T MISBEHAVING.

09:57.102 --> 09:59.179
STILL MAKING
GOOD ON THE TRUTH
WITH THE SALVADORANS.

09:59.276 --> 10:01.775
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

10:02.153 --> 10:03.392
ON ACCOUNT OF
YOU TRYING TO PLAY US.

10:03.393 --> 10:04.228
 <i>NO TIENDO.</i>

10:04.680 --> 10:05.614
WE HEARD ABOUT THE RAT

10:05.680 --> 10:06.547
YOU GOT UNDERCOVER
WITH THOSE FOOLS.

10:06.614 --> 10:07.580
I AIN'T STUPID, HOMES.

10:08.897 --> 10:09.814
YOU'RE FULL OF SHIT.

10:10.781 --> 10:12.447
IF WE HAD SOMEONE UNDER
WITH THE SALVADORANS,

10:12.514 --> 10:14.647

19:28.514 --> 19:30.280
HERNAN SAYS
TO LET IT GO DOWN,

19:30.347 --> 19:32.514
BUT TO GET THE INNOCENTS
OUT OF THE WAY.

19:32.580 --> 19:35.113
HOW MUCH OF WHAT HE'S
INTO DO YOU KNOW ABOUT?

19:36.180 --> 19:37.380
JUST THAT HE'S
SOME SORT OF COP

19:37.447 --> 19:40.330
AND THAT HE TRUSTS YOU
TO HAVE HIS BACK.

19:41.347 --> 19:43.492
YOU TOLD ANYBODY ELSE
ABOUT ANY OF THIS?

19:43.580 --> 19:47.213
NO, I--NO, THAT COULD
GET US BOTH KILLED.

19:47.280 --> 19:50.013
LIKE THAT GUY
YOUR BOYFRIEND DUMPED

19:50.080 --> 19:51.680
IN THAT VACANT
ALLEY WITH YOUR CAR?

19:51.747 --> 19:53.847
HERNAN DIDN'T HAVE
NO CHOICE, ALL RIGHT?

19:53.914 --> 19:55.614
THAT GUY WAS A SNITCH.

19:55.680 --> 19:57.847
OTAVIO HAD HIM EXECUTED,
ALL RIGHT?

19:57.914 --> 20:00.596
ORDERED HERNAN
TO GET RID OF THE BODY
TO PROVE HIS LOYALTY.

20:02.447 --> 20:04.647
CAN YOU GET
A MESSAGE TO HERNAN?

20:04.714 --> 20:06.881
ALL RIGHT. YOU TELL HIM
THAT HE'S GIVING

20:06.947 --> 20:08.947
HIS BOSSES IN D.C.
A BAD CASE
OF THE NERVES.

20:09.013 --> 20:10.347
THEY WANT HIM
TO COME IN.

20:10.413 --> 20:12.447
ALSO, LEAVE THE CAR
PARKED WHERE IT IS.

20:14.064 --> 20:16.247
I'LL FIGURE
OUT A PLAN TO DEAL
WITH THIS ROBBERY.

20:16.313 --> 20:18.080
I'LL LEAVE
ANY INSTRUCTIONS

20:18.146 --> 20:22.647
IN THE RIGHT FRONT WHEEL
WELL OF THE CAR BY 4:00.

20:29.013 --> 20:30.080
ALL RIGHT.

20:30.146 --> 20:31.614
I WANT TO SPEAK
TO MY ATTORNEY.

20:31.680 --> 20:33.914
LOOK, I DON'T GIVE
A SHIT IF YOU'VE GOT
AN ILLEGAL FISH MARKET

20:33.981 --> 20:35.380
RUNNING OUT
OF YOUR BEDROOM.

20:35.447 --> 20:37.680
I JUST WANT TO KNOW
WHAT WENT DOWN AT YOUR
CONDO 2 WEEKS AGO

20:37.747 --> 20:39.347
YOU DON'T WANT TO TALK
TO COPS ABOUT.

20:39.413 --> 20:42.180
YOU DO THAT,
YOU STREET WALK OUT
OF HERE A FREE WOMAN.

20:44.713 --> 20:45.447
ALL RIGHT.

20:45.514 --> 20:47.714
YOU JUST BOUGHT
YOU AND YOUR MONEY MAKER
30 DAYS IN COUNTY.

20:47.780 --> 20:50.113
WE GOT JACKED.

20:50.180 --> 20:51.413
HOW MUCH?

20:51.480 --> 20:52.797
2,500.

20:53.963 --> 20:55.547
THIS GUY CALLED
FOR AN APPOINTMENT.

20:55.614 --> 20:56.947
SOUNDED WISE,

20:57.013 --> 20:58.947
LIKE A REGULAR
BUSINESS JOHN.

20:59.013 --> 21:01.347
I ANSWER THE DOOR,
3 BLACK MEN PUSHED
THEIR WAY IN.

21:01.413 --> 21:03.313
THEY MADE US LAY DOWN
FACE DOWN ON THE FLOOR.

21:03.380 --> 21:07.080
SAID IF WE MADE ANY
MOVES OR LOOKED AT THEM,
THEY'D SHOOT US.

21:07.996 --> 21:08.714
WHO ARE YOU
TRICKIN' FOR?

21:08.780 --> 21:10.714
THE DEAL WAS,
I TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED,

21:10.780 --> 21:12.664
YOU FORGET ABOUT
THE REST OF WHAT I DO.

21:20.514 --> 21:21.647
YOUR BOSSES KNOW
ABOUT THE BURGLARY?

21:21.714 --> 21:23.647
ME AND THE GIRLS
BEEN WORKING

21:23.714 --> 21:25.247
DOUBLE SHIFTS
EVER SINCE.

21:25.313 --> 21:28.313
NO DAYS OFF UNTIL
THE MONEY'S PAID BACK.

21:28.380 --> 21:31.514
I NEED YOU TO TRY
AND REMEMBER WHAT
THESE GUYS LOOKED LIKE.

21:32.881 --> 21:34.447
HOW LONG IS THIS
GOING TO TAKE?

21:34.514 --> 21:37.113
I GOT A GOLDEN SHOWER
PLANNED THIS AFTERNOON.

21:37.180 --> 21:38.247
BIG TIPPER.

21:38.313 --> 21:39.747
I GOT TO START
DRINKING ICED TEA

21:39.814 --> 21:41.530
TO GET IT
THE WAY HE LIKES.

21:43.714 --> 21:47.163
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK
WITH THOSE MUG BOOKS
AND A SNAPPLE.

21:49.514 --> 21:51.580
IS HERNAN ALIVE?

21:51.647 --> 21:52.847
ASSUMING
HIS GIRLFRIEND'S TELLING

21:52.914 --> 21:53.914
THE TRUTH
IN ANY OF THIS.

21:53.981 --> 21:55.647
WELL, MY STRONG SENSE
AND HER BROWN PANTIES

21:55.714 --> 21:57.180
LEAD ME TO BELIEVE
SHE'S ON THE LEVEL.

21:57.247 --> 21:58.647
IF WE INTERDICT
THIS ROBBERY,

21:58.714 --> 22:01.447
WE BLOW HERNAN'S COVER
AND WHATEVER BIG ONE
HE'S ABOUT TO HIT.

22:01.514 --> 22:03.013
WE'RE NOT LETTING
THAT KIND OF HEAT

22:03.080 --> 22:04.614
GET INTO THE HANDS
OF THESE THUGS.

22:04.680 --> 22:06.892
THINK OF
THE DAMAGE THEY DID
WITH A COUPLE MACHETES.

22:07.063 --> 22:08.547
THERE'S GOT TO BE A WAY
TO KEEP THOSE GUNS
OFF THE STREET

22:08.747 --> 22:10.013
AND STILL KEEP
HERNAN IN PLAY.

22:10.080 --> 22:11.046
THE LONGER
HE STAYS UNDER,

22:11.113 --> 22:12.180
THE BETTER THE CHANCE
HE'S GOING

22:12.247 --> 22:13.981
TO GIVE US WHO DID
THE SAN MARCOS KILLINGS.

22:14.046 --> 22:15.046
LOOK, SCREW HIS COVER.

22:15.113 --> 22:17.313
OUR INSTRUCTIONS
ARE TO NOTIFY I.C.E.

22:17.380 --> 22:19.046
AS SOON
AS HE MAKES CONTACT.

22:19.113 --> 22:20.514
TECHNICALLY, HE DIDN'T.

22:20.580 --> 22:22.013
THE GIRLFRIEND DID.

22:22.080 --> 22:24.580
CAN WE AT LEAST
HOLD OFF NOTIFYING
I.C.E. UNTIL WE SCOOP HERE?

22:24.647 --> 22:26.814
GETTING THE FEDS INVOLVED
WITH THE SITUATION REPORTS

22:26.881 --> 22:28.680
AND THE BUREAU CHIEFS WILL
FUBAR THE WHOLE THING.

22:28.747 --> 22:30.981
YOUR ORDERS ARE
TO HEAD OFF THIS ROBBERY

22:31.046 --> 22:32.514
AND ARREST
THE PEOPLE INVOLVED.

22:32.580 --> 22:33.881
AND GET SHANE IN ON THIS.

22:33.947 --> 22:35.947
HE'S WITH A HOOKER
IN INTERROGATION.

22:36.013 --> 22:37.614
I DON'T WANT HIM
FREELANCING FOR VICE

22:37.680 --> 22:39.113
WHILE HE'S STILL
UNDER MY COMMAND.

22:46.180 --> 22:48.447
WE GOT
TO PROTECT CLAUDETTE
FROM OURSELF HERE.

22:48.514 --> 22:49.814
THAT FED RAGGING
ON HER THIS MORNING

22:49.881 --> 22:51.780
HAS GOT
HER TAKING THE PATH
OF LEAST RESISTANCE.

22:51.847 --> 22:54.413
REEL IN HERNAN.
TURN HIM OVER TO I.C.E.

22:54.480 --> 22:55.814
COME HERE.

22:59.881 --> 23:01.413
IT'S ONE HELL OF A RISK.

23:01.480 --> 23:03.180
DISOBEYING AN ORDER
AND GOING BEHIND HER BACK

23:03.247 --> 23:04.881
WHEN WE DON'T
EVEN KNOW FOR SURE.

23:04.947 --> 23:06.113
YOU WANT TO STAY
IN THIS JOB?

23:06.180 --> 23:07.447
WENT ON THE STREET,

23:07.514 --> 23:10.247
YOU DON'T DO IT
BY LISTENING
TO UPPER MANAGEMENT.

23:10.313 --> 23:11.413
NOW, WE PULL THIS OFF,

23:11.480 --> 23:12.780
WE KEEP THE GUNS
OUT OF THE WRONG HANDS

23:12.847 --> 23:15.013
AND WE PRESERVE
HERNAN'S COVER

23:15.080 --> 23:17.430
LONG ENOUGH TO FIND OUT
ABOUT SAN MARCOS.

23:21.247 --> 23:22.847
NO GUTS,
NO GLORY, RIGHT?

23:28.413 --> 23:29.965
THESE BOOST JOBS
IN YOUR POP'S BUILDINGS.

23:30.863 --> 23:31.763
IT'S PART OF A STRING

23:31.930 --> 23:33.930
OF A DOZEN OR MORE
OVER THE LAST SIX MONTHS.

23:33.997 --> 23:35.297
INTERESTING THING,

23:35.364 --> 23:36.530
HIS CREW
ONLY TARGETS PLACES

23:36.596 --> 23:38.830
THAT ESCORT SERVICES
OPERATE OUT OF.

23:38.897 --> 23:40.730
A WHOLE GANG
OF RUSSIAN HOOKERS

23:40.797 --> 23:42.231
CALL YOUR POP'S
BUILDINGS HOME.

23:42.496 --> 23:43.897
HE'S NOT INVOLVED
IN THAT KIND OF THING.

23:43.964 --> 23:45.763
WE ARE REAL ESTATE
INVESTORS.

23:45.830 --> 23:46.980
SPECIALIZING
IN COSSACK COOCH.

23:47.797 --> 23:49.930
IT'S CALLED
A NATASHA TRADE.

23:49.997 --> 23:51.130
GIRL GETS A PLACE TO LIVE,

23:51.197 --> 23:53.596
1/3, 2/3 SPLIT
WITH THE BOSS,

23:53.663 --> 23:56.481
WHO ALSO HOLDS
ONTO THEIR PASSPORTS
FOR SAFE KEEPING.

23:58.496 --> 24:00.064
NOW, WHATEVER LEGIT BUSINESS
YOUR FATHER'S GOTTEN INTO,

24:01.130 --> 24:04.830
IT'S JUST WINDOW DRESSING
WRAPPED AROUND THE SAME OLD
SCHOOL GANGSTER SHIT.

24:09.197 --> 24:10.830
AND THE ROBBERS?

24:10.897 --> 24:12.930
I GOT A TENTATIVE
I.D. ON ONE OF THEM.

24:12.997 --> 24:14.115
STILL NEEDS TO BE VERIFIED.

24:16.364 --> 24:18.396
I'LL BE IN TOUCH
WHEN I GET SOMETHING
A LITTLE MORE DEFINITE.

24:18.563 --> 24:19.463
THANK YOU.

24:19.530 --> 24:22.044
AND, UH, I'M SORRY
FOR THE TROUBLES.

24:26.730 --> 24:29.064
THESE GENTLEMEN HAVE AGREED
TO IMMUNITY, ELEANOR.

24:29.130 --> 24:31.064
YOU TELL THEM EVERYTHING
YOU REMEMBER.

24:31.130 --> 24:33.277
I KNOW
THESE GUYS, IT'S OK.

24:34.997 --> 24:36.431
MY BEST FRIEND TOLD ME
ABOUT THIS PLACE.

24:36.496 --> 24:37.997
IT HAS INCREDIBLE REPLICAS.

24:38.064 --> 24:39.230
I BOUGHT 3.

24:39.297 --> 24:41.070
A LITTLE OVERBOARD,
BUT AT THOSE PRICES,
I COULD--

24:41.080 --> 24:43.188
YOU MAKE IT A HABIT
OF ROAMING THE BARRIO
FOR CHEAP HANDBAGS?

24:44.830 --> 24:46.280
NURSES HERE DO
IT ALL THE TIME.

24:46.347 --> 24:49.297
HE KNOCKED
ME DOWN, STABBED ME,
TOOK OFF RUNNING.

24:49.364 --> 24:51.364
THERE WASN'T EVEN TIME
TO GRAB MY MACE.

24:51.431 --> 24:54.463
SO, YOU LOST
THE 3 PURSES YOU BOUGHT,

24:54.530 --> 24:55.463
PLUS THE ONE
YOU HAD WITH YOU.

24:55.530 --> 24:56.596
THEY'RE NOT PURSES.

24:56.663 --> 24:58.264
2 WERE EVENING CLUTCHES,

24:58.331 --> 24:59.730
THE OTHER
WAS A KEEPALL.

24:59.797 --> 25:01.764
AND WHAT DID THIS
KEEPALL BANDIT LOOK LIKE?

25:02.331 --> 25:03.697
MEXICAN, PUERTO RICAN.

25:03.763 --> 25:05.797
SMELLED AWFUL, LIKE
WHEN WE HAD A DEAD RAT

25:05.863 --> 25:07.092
IN THE WALL
AT THE MONTECITO HOUSE.

25:08.197 --> 25:10.230
PROBABLY THOUGHT
THE KNOCK-OFFS WERE
REAL.

25:10.297 --> 25:11.226
FIGURED HE'D STRUCK
A GOLD MINE.

25:11.363 --> 25:13.280
KNOCK-OFFS ARE WHAT
THEY SELL IN TIMES SQUARE.

25:13.797 --> 25:15.230
THESE ARE QUALITY REPLICAS.

25:15.297 --> 25:16.264
THERE'S QUITE A DIFFERENCE.

25:18.730 --> 25:19.830
SHE SAID FOR $60

25:19.897 --> 25:21.413
YOU CAN'T TELL THE DIFFERENCE
FROM THE REAL THING.

25:21.830 --> 25:23.131
THESE REPLICAS
ARE THAT AMAZING.

25:23.397 --> 25:25.431
WELL, IT'S ALL ABOUT
THE QUALITY OF HARDWARE.

25:25.496 --> 25:27.263
EMBOSSED, WELL-SEALED,
GOOD WEIGHT.

25:27.630 --> 25:28.863
MEN HAVE <i>HUSTLER</i> MAGAZINE,

25:28.930 --> 25:31.064
I HAVE THE MARC JACOBS
LOOK BOOK.

25:31.130 --> 25:32.596
I'M A CLASSIC GUCCI GIRL.

25:32.663 --> 25:35.730
MEDIUM HOBO WITH A SINGLE
NONADJUSTABLE BUCKLE STRAP.

25:36.797 --> 25:39.680
I KEEP THINKING SOMEDAY,
BUT NOT AT THESE WAGES.

25:40.497 --> 25:42.714
I GOT MY DIAPER BAG
FROM OLD NAVY.

25:44.997 --> 25:47.264
I'VE SEEN THOSE.
THEY'RE PRETTY STYLISH.

25:50.097 --> 25:52.230
ALL RIGHT.
I'VE COORDINATED
WITH THE UNIS.

25:52.297 --> 25:54.230
HEY.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

25:54.297 --> 25:55.997
THE SALS ARE KNOCKING
OVER A GUN STORE,

25:56.064 --> 25:57.097
WE'RE GOING
TO LET THEM DO IT.

25:57.164 --> 25:58.714
VIC'S WALKING EVERYONE
THROUGH THE DETAILS.

25:58.981 --> 25:59.964
EDDIE AND TINA ARE
GOING TO BE RUNNING

26:00.030 --> 26:01.539
THE CHECKPOINT
OVER ON THE MONITOR.

26:01.580 --> 26:02.913
ARE THEY IN THE LOOP
ON OUR END OF THE PLAN?

26:02.930 --> 26:04.857
NO. WHICH IS WHY
OUR FIRST PRIORITY

26:04.864 --> 26:05.886
NEEDS TO BE
WATCHING THEIR BACKS

26:05.946 --> 26:07.098
IN CASE THIS THING
GOES SIDEWAYS.

26:07.099 --> 26:07.831
THAT'S NOT
GOING TO HAPPEN.

26:07.896 --> 26:08.902
AS LONG
AS HERNAN STICKS

26:08.913 --> 26:10.584
TO THE PLAYBOOK THAT WE
HID ON HIS FRONT WHEEL.

26:10.656 --> 26:12.122
PROBLEM IS, WE'VE BEEN
COMMUNICATING WITH HIM

26:12.140 --> 26:13.953
BY CARRIER PIGEON
ESSENTIALLY,

26:13.957 --> 26:15.990
SO WE'VE GOT TO BE READY
FOR ANYTHING THAT JUMPS UP.

26:15.995 --> 26:17.713
ALL RIGHT, SO,
EVERYONE CLEAR
ON THEIR ASSIGNMENTS?

26:17.724 --> 26:18.724
YEAH.
YEAH.

26:18.790 --> 26:19.657
WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO DO?

26:19.724 --> 26:21.024
I'LL FILL YOU IN
ON THE WAY.

26:26.423 --> 26:28.190
RIGHT ON TIME.

26:28.257 --> 26:30.290
JULIEN.
YOU'RE ABOUT
TO HAVE COMPANY.

26:30.357 --> 26:31.524
Julien: COPY THAT.

26:31.590 --> 26:33.991
ALIVE AND UPRIGHT.

26:34.056 --> 26:35.156
YOU STAKE THE POINT.

26:35.223 --> 26:36.090
GOOD.

26:39.690 --> 26:42.156
HO. HEY!
TAKE IT EASY.

26:42.223 --> 26:43.257
BE COOL, MAN, BE COOL.

26:43.323 --> 26:44.323
KEYS, MAN, KEYS.

26:44.390 --> 26:45.991
IN MY POCKET.

26:50.123 --> 26:51.190
Vic: HERE THEY COME.

27:02.573 --> 27:03.840
JESUS, NICE HAUL.

27:08.991 --> 27:10.690
SUSPECT VEHICLE
IS ON THE MOVE.

27:10.757 --> 27:12.290
JULIEN, YOU OK?

27:12.357 --> 27:14.957
AFFIRMATIVE,
ALL GOOD HERE.

27:17.590 --> 27:18.724
GOT A VISUAL.

27:18.790 --> 27:21.056
EASTBOUND ON SUNSET,
COMING UP ON ECHO PARK.

27:21.123 --> 27:22.290
COPY THAT.

27:23.524 --> 27:26.824
OK. WE'RE MOVING
INTO SECOND POSITION.

27:26.891 --> 27:27.924
WE SEE YOU UP AHEAD.

27:27.991 --> 27:29.690
WE'RE
5 CAR LENGTHS BEHIND.

27:30.657 --> 27:32.223
ALL RIGHT, DON'T GET
TOO CLOSE TO HIM NOW.

27:32.290 --> 27:33.390
HANG BACK.
HANG BACK.

27:33.457 --> 27:35.090
BUCKLE UP, SHANE.

27:35.156 --> 27:37.173
HE'S TURNING
INTO THE CHECKPOINT.

27:40.490 --> 27:41.423
READY, PLEASE.

27:41.490 --> 27:43.090
IT'S JUST
A ROUTINE CHECK.

27:49.490 --> 27:50.957
HAVE YOUR LICENSE,
REGISTRATION,

27:51.023 --> 27:52.407
PROOF OF INSURANCE
READY, PLEASE.

27:57.223 --> 27:59.924
HE'S TELLING
HIS BUDDY HIS CAR
REGISTRATION EXPIRED.

27:59.991 --> 28:01.190
THEY DON'T LOOK TOO HAPPY.

28:01.257 --> 28:02.757
WHAT TO DO?

28:02.824 --> 28:03.790
GO FOR IT.

28:03.857 --> 28:05.457
AND PRAY NOBODY ASKS
TO POP THE TRUNK?

28:05.524 --> 28:07.790
OR RISK GOING AWAY
FOR A FEW DECADES.

28:07.857 --> 28:09.891
IF IT WERE ME,
I'D GO WITH MY FEET.

28:09.957 --> 28:11.891
LET'S HOPE HERNAN
MAKES THE CASE

28:11.957 --> 28:14.357
AND HE'S THE ONLY ONE
WHO PULLS A GUN.

28:16.257 --> 28:17.624
WE'VE GOT RABBITS.

28:17.690 --> 28:19.190
SHANE, GO!

28:20.257 --> 28:22.156
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

28:22.223 --> 28:23.757
EASY, EASY.

28:23.824 --> 28:25.123
WHOA. WHOA. WHOA.

28:25.190 --> 28:26.824
HEY, BUDDY,
TAKE IT EASY, TAKE
IT EASY, ALL RIGHT?

28:28.857 --> 28:30.624
SHANE. YOU OK?

28:31.490 --> 28:33.524
OK, WE'RE CLEAR.
THAT'S GOOD.

28:34.590 --> 28:35.690
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
NO WORRIES.

28:35.757 --> 28:36.757
IT'S OK, DANNY.

28:36.824 --> 28:37.891
WE CAN CALL
THE SURVEILLANCE OFF.

28:37.957 --> 28:40.374
WE GOT WHAT WE WANTED.
IT'S OK.

28:43.056 --> 28:45.524
EXPLORATORY COMMITTEE
ALLOWS YOU TO PUT
A FINGER IN THE AIR

28:45.590 --> 28:47.223
TO FIND OUT WHAT
THE PUBLIC WANTS TO HEAR.

28:47.290 --> 28:48.857
WHY NOT JUST ANNOUNCE
MY CANDIDACY?

28:48.924 --> 28:50.423
LET ME TELL YOU WHY
THAT'S A SHIT AWFUL IDEA.

28:50.490 --> 28:52.190
YOU SAY YOU'RE
RUNNING FOR MAYOR,

28:52.257 --> 28:55.590
YOU IMMEDIATELY TRIGGER
A FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
EVENT UNDER THE STATUTE.

28:55.657 --> 28:57.090
AND OUR SUPPORTERS
AND HOW MUCH
THEY'RE GIVING.

28:57.156 --> 28:59.023
INFORMATION OUR ENEMIES
CAN USE AGAINST US.

28:59.090 --> 29:00.790
EXPLORATORY COMMITTEE
ALSO ALLOWS YOU

29:00.857 --> 29:03.540
TO INVESTIGATE
THE FEASIBILITY OF RUNNING
FOR ANOTHER OFFICE.

29:03.757 --> 29:05.557
STATE ASSEMBLY,
FOR INSTANCE.

29:05.624 --> 29:08.357
WOULD WE EVEN
HAVE A SHOT AT THAT?

29:09.290 --> 29:10.873
WITH SOME MASSAGING.

29:14.924 --> 29:16.690
YOU HAVE A KOREAN PROBLEM.

29:16.757 --> 29:18.023
CONSERVATIVE.

29:18.090 --> 29:20.023
LESS SYMPATHETIC
TO OUR POPULOUS
LATINO PLATFORM.

29:20.090 --> 29:22.757
BUT ANY ELECTION
CAN BE WON BY CRACKING,
STACKING, AND PACKING.

29:22.824 --> 29:24.156
YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT REDISTRICTING.

29:24.223 --> 29:25.957
CRACK THE KOREAN
CONSTITUENCY,

29:26.023 --> 29:27.857
STACK IT OVER 3
OR 4 OTHER DISTRICTS,

29:27.924 --> 29:29.257
YOU NULLIFY
THEIR INFLUENCE,

29:29.323 --> 29:31.357
PACK THE NEW BOUNDARY
WITH LATINOS.

29:31.423 --> 29:32.690
YEAH.

29:32.757 --> 29:34.357
THEN FOCUS
OUR RESOURCES ON GETTING
OUT THE CORE VOTE.

29:34.423 --> 29:36.824
BUT I WOULD ALSO
ANNEX THESE FOLKS HERE.

29:36.891 --> 29:38.724
OUR MESSAGE DOESN'T FLY
WITH BLACK FOLKS EITHER.

29:38.790 --> 29:40.457
DOESN'T MATTER.
THEY DON'T VOTE.

29:40.524 --> 29:41.824
REPRESENT MORE PEOPLE,

29:41.891 --> 29:43.423
THE MORE INFLUENCE
YOU HAVE IN SACRAMENTO

29:43.490 --> 29:45.090
AND EVEN THOUGH
THEY DON'T SUPPORT US...

29:45.156 --> 29:46.357
THEY DON'T
HURT YOU EITHER.

29:46.423 --> 29:48.724
BEST PART OF ALL THIS
IS YOU CAN SPEARHEAD

29:48.790 --> 29:50.123
THE REDISTRICTING
OF YOUR FUTURE OFFICE

29:50.190 --> 29:52.824
RIGHT NOW FROM YOUR
COUNCILMAN'S SEAT

29:52.891 --> 29:57.657
REDRAWING THESE
LINES IS GOING TO COST
A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY.

29:57.724 --> 30:00.257
MOTHER'S MILK
OF POLITICS.

30:01.873 --> 30:03.056
FOR THE EXPLORATORY
COMMITTEE.

30:03.123 --> 30:04.174
THANK YOU.

30:07.056 --> 30:09.290
IT'S ONLY FOR 100,000.

30:09.357 --> 30:11.824
YOU'LL GET THE OTHER
HALF WHEN THE PEOPLE

30:11.891 --> 30:14.824
RESPONSIBLE FOR
THE SAN MARCOS KILLINGS
ARE BROUGHT TO JUSTICE.

30:14.991 --> 30:16.223
THERE WILL BE CLOSURE.

30:16.290 --> 30:17.557
I PROMISE YOU.

30:17.624 --> 30:20.390
BEFORE I PLOW ANY MORE
MONEY INTO A WAR ZONE,

30:20.907 --> 30:22.257
I NEED TO SEE
A DEMONSTRATION

30:22.323 --> 30:23.423
OF THE RULE OF LAW,

30:23.490 --> 30:25.757
NOT THE LAW
OF THE JUNGLE.

30:25.824 --> 30:28.757
SHOULD HAVE DENIED
A REQUEST FOR IMMUNITY
AND BOOKED HER.

30:28.824 --> 30:30.090
YEAH, ESPECIALLY
AFTER SHE SLAMMED DUTCH BOY

30:30.156 --> 30:32.056
FOR BEING TOO
LOW BROW TO APPRECIATE
THE FINER THINGS.

30:32.123 --> 30:34.056
TRADEMARK INFRINGEMENT'S
A SERIOUS DEAL.

30:34.123 --> 30:35.357
SO'S ASSAULT
WITH A DEADLY WEAPON.

30:35.423 --> 30:36.991
FIND THE GUY
WITH THE KNIFE.

30:37.056 --> 30:38.657
AT LEAST EXPEDITE
A SEARCH WARRANT

30:38.724 --> 30:39.790
FOR THE KNOCK-OFF EMPORIUM.

30:39.857 --> 30:41.257
IS THIS REALLY
A PRESSING ISSUE?

30:41.323 --> 30:42.690
AS LONG AS THIS PLACE
STAYS IN BUSINESS,

30:42.757 --> 30:43.924
IT'S GOING TO ATTRACT
UPSCALE CLIENTELE

30:43.991 --> 30:45.190
TO A SHITTY
NEIGHBORHOOD.

30:45.257 --> 30:46.857
WHICH COULD LEAD
TO MORE STABBINGS
OR WORSE.

30:46.924 --> 30:48.657
I'LL GET TO IT
BUT MAKE AN ARREST.

30:48.724 --> 30:52.056
THE LAST THING I NEED
IS A WELL-CONNECTED
PAMPERED SOCIALITE

30:52.123 --> 30:53.657
BREATHING DOWN MY NECK.

30:53.724 --> 30:55.357
THAT'S WHAT
I HAVE ACEVEDA FOR.

30:55.423 --> 30:58.123
IF YOU'RE HARBORING
FOR A SAN MARCOS UPDATE,

30:58.190 --> 30:59.490
NO NEWS TO REPORT.

30:59.557 --> 31:00.857
WELL, I'M SURE YOU'RE
DOING EVERYTHING YOU CAN.

31:00.924 --> 31:03.891
I ACTUALLY CAME DOWN
TO SEE WHAT ELSE YOU NEED

31:03.957 --> 31:07.557
IN THE WAY OF SOURCES,
ADDITIONAL OVERTIME,
TECH SUPPORT.

31:07.624 --> 31:08.957
ALL OF THE ABOVE.

31:09.023 --> 31:12.223
WHAT CAN
YOU TELL ME ABOUT
THIS LATEST HOMICIDE?

31:12.290 --> 31:13.624
IS IT CONNECTED?

31:13.690 --> 31:15.490
I'M ALREADY IN HOT WATER
FOR BRIEFING YOU

31:15.557 --> 31:18.390
ABOUT THE I.C.E. AGENT
WE WENT AFTER
IN THE WARRANT SEARCH,

31:18.457 --> 31:20.223
THEN HE WENT MISSING.

31:20.290 --> 31:21.857
CLAUDETTE, THIS IS ME.

31:21.924 --> 31:23.790
YOU'RE NOT SUGGESTING--

31:23.857 --> 31:25.490
NO, OF COURSE NOT,

31:25.557 --> 31:28.991
BUT I SHOULD NOT
HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING
SECURE INTEL WITH ANYONE.

31:29.056 --> 31:30.056
NOT EVEN YOU.

31:30.123 --> 31:31.624
IT'S NOTE TO SELF.

31:31.690 --> 31:35.056
WELL...PUT TOGETHER
A MEMO DETAILING

31:35.123 --> 31:37.724
THE THINGS YOU NEED
AND I'LL GET RIGHT TO IT.

31:44.557 --> 31:46.590
NEVER HIT THE STREETS
OF FARMINGTON.

31:48.290 --> 31:50.494
BUT HERNAN'S IN THE WIND,
AND THE OTHER PERPS
ARE STILL AT LARGE.

31:50.495 --> 31:50.907
HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?

31:50.924 --> 31:52.257
I CALLED AN AUDIBLE.

31:52.323 --> 31:55.524
THE WISER COURSE
OF ACTION WAS NOT
TO INTERCEPT THEM

31:55.590 --> 31:58.190
AT THE GUN STORE WHERE
THESE COULD HAVE BEEN
USED AGAINST MY TEAM.

31:58.257 --> 31:59.390
SAFER TO WAIT UNTIL
THEY WERE LOCKED

31:59.457 --> 32:00.390
IN THE TRUNK.

32:00.457 --> 32:01.107
AT THE CHECKPOINT,

32:01.200 --> 32:03.423
THE SUSPECTS READ
THE PLAY AND WERE ABLE
TO ELUDE CAPTURE,

32:03.490 --> 32:05.023
BUT WE'LL GET 'EM.

32:05.090 --> 32:07.107
GIVE US A SECOND, WILL YA?

32:10.257 --> 32:11.624
THAT MAN'S IN THE MIX.

32:11.690 --> 32:14.457
YOU THINK
MY BULLSHIT DETECTOR
ISN'T ALREADY ON HIGH?

32:14.524 --> 32:17.190
NOW. LISTEN. I MADE
THIS CALL, OK, NOT HIM.

32:17.257 --> 32:18.190
WERE THE UNIS
IN ON THIS?

32:18.257 --> 32:19.790
IN ON WHAT?
IT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING

32:19.857 --> 32:21.624
THAT THEY WERE
OPERATING A ROUTINE
INSURANCE CHECK.

32:21.690 --> 32:24.123
AUTHORIZED BY WHOM?
BECAUSE IT WASN'T ME.

32:24.190 --> 32:25.724
I GO THROUGH
THAT PAPERWORK,

32:25.790 --> 32:28.624
I BET I'LL
FIND YOUR SIGNATURE
OR VIC'S.

32:29.490 --> 32:31.857
YOU KNOWINGLY PUT
DEPARTMENT PERSONNEL
IN HARM'S WAY

32:31.924 --> 32:33.423
WITHOUT EVEN GIVING
THEM A HEADS UP?

32:33.490 --> 32:36.056
HARM'S WAY IS PART
OF THE JOB DESCRIPTION.

32:37.257 --> 32:38.390
I BROUGHT
YOU IN HERE

32:38.457 --> 32:39.590
BECAUSE I THOUGHT
YOU COULD BE TRUSTED,

32:39.657 --> 32:41.390
BECAUSE YOU'RE
NOT VIC MACKEY.

32:41.457 --> 32:42.624
NOW, YOU'RE LETTING
HIM PULL YOU

32:42.690 --> 32:44.957
BY THE NOSE RIGHT
IN MY CROSS HAIRS.

32:45.023 --> 32:46.957
NO. THIS ENTIRE CITY
IS BREATHING DOWN YOUR NECK

32:47.023 --> 32:48.724
AND MINE OVER
THOSE 12 DEAD MEXICANS.

32:48.790 --> 32:51.223
HERNAN CAN CLOSE
THAT CASE FOR US.

32:51.290 --> 32:52.857
THIS ISN'T ABOUT HERNAN.

32:52.924 --> 32:55.423
YOU WANT TO FOLLOW VIC
OUT THE DOOR, KEEP IT UP.

32:55.490 --> 32:57.557
THE CHOICE IS YOURS.

33:08.224 --> 33:09.691
HEY, JUNETEENTH FREEMAN.

33:09.756 --> 33:11.123
MMM?

33:11.190 --> 33:13.190
PAROLE OFFICER
SAID I'D FIND YOU OUT
HERE BEAUTIFYING AMERICA.

33:13.257 --> 33:15.756
YOU GOT ABOUT
400 HOURS LEFT, RIGHT?

33:15.823 --> 33:17.457
WHAT THE HELL YOU WANT?

33:17.524 --> 33:18.052
HEY, WHO ARE YOU?

33:18.256 --> 33:19.924
COOPERATING
WITH A POLICE INVESTIGATION.

33:19.990 --> 33:21.423
OK.

33:21.490 --> 33:22.857
LOOK, I'M ALL OVER
THE GAME YOU AND YOUR BOYS

33:22.924 --> 33:24.223
HAVE BEEN RUNNING
ON THE WORKING GIRLS.

33:25.246 --> 33:26.829
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT, OFFICER.

33:27.246 --> 33:28.078
YOU PICK UP ENOUGH GARBAGE,

33:28.080 --> 33:30.262
THEY'RE GOING
TO KICK THAT FELONY DOWN
TO MISDEMEANOR POSSESSION.

33:30.379 --> 33:31.946
UNLESS, OF COURSE,
I START COMING AFTER YOU.

33:32.063 --> 33:34.262
A BUNCH OF B AND E's
ADD ASSAULTS AND WHATNOT.

33:34.329 --> 33:36.030
YOU CAN'T PROVE SHIT.

33:36.097 --> 33:37.730
TRY ME.

33:37.796 --> 33:39.629
COURSE YOU COULD
PLAY THIS ANOTHER WAY.

33:39.696 --> 33:41.429
CUT ME IN ON THESE
JOBS YOU'RE DOING.

33:41.496 --> 33:42.663
I RUN INTERFERENCE.

33:42.730 --> 33:44.730
I MONITOR THE DISPATCH SO YOU
DON'T GET ALL GAFFLED UP

33:44.796 --> 33:47.030
LIKE ALMOST HAPPENED
AT THAT CONDO ON WINMORE.

33:47.097 --> 33:49.097
I'M GOING TO NEED
500 UP FRONT,

33:49.163 --> 33:51.396
EARNEST MONEY
AND AN EQUAL SPLIT

33:51.463 --> 33:53.030
BETWEEN YOU
AND THE OTHER 2.

33:54.663 --> 33:56.730
GOT TO ASK MY NIGGS.

33:56.796 --> 33:58.063
YOU MEAN PANCAKE
AND SQUEEZE?

33:59.930 --> 34:00.930
HOW'D YOU KNOW
IT WAS PANCAKE

34:00.996 --> 34:01.963
AND SQUEEZE
DOING THE WOMEN?

34:02.030 --> 34:03.696
SAW YOU HAD
PRIORS TOGETHER,

34:03.763 --> 34:05.796
BUT I DIDN'T KNOW FOR SURE
UNTIL JUST RIGHT NOW.

34:05.863 --> 34:06.896
SO, THANK YOU.

34:08.463 --> 34:10.228
LOOK, IF MY DUDE'S
COOL WITH THIS,

34:10.295 --> 34:11.529
HOW AM I GOING
TO GET WITH YOU?

34:11.596 --> 34:12.728
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

34:22.030 --> 34:23.862
YOU SAID YOUR FATHER
WAS TRAVELING,

34:23.929 --> 34:25.197
I DIDN'T THINK YOU
MEANT HIGHWAY TO HEAVEN.

34:26.262 --> 34:27.097
RAN AN DATA SEARCH.

34:27.163 --> 34:29.295
911 CALL 11 DAYS AGO.

34:29.362 --> 34:31.529
HE WAS TRANSPORTED HERE
ON A FULL CARDIAC ARREST.

34:31.596 --> 34:33.629
MERCIFUL JESUS
HEARD MY PRAYERS.

34:33.696 --> 34:35.362
HE'S DOING
MUCH BETTER NOW.

34:35.429 --> 34:36.529
NO, HE'S NOT.

34:36.596 --> 34:37.830
I CHATTED UP
A NURSE.

34:37.896 --> 34:40.529
THEY DON'T EXPECT HIM
TO LAST THE WEEK.

34:41.830 --> 34:44.030
HOW LONG DO YOU THINK
YOU CAN KEEP THIS A SECRET?

34:45.529 --> 34:47.496
LONG ENOUGH
FOR A MIRACLE.

34:49.413 --> 34:51.030
IN THE MEANTIME,
YOU THINK YOU'RE
RUNNING THE SHOW?

34:54.629 --> 34:55.529
I DON'T KNOW.

34:57.930 --> 35:01.796
I'M NOT GOING TO LET
EVERYTHING MY FATHER SPENT
A LIFETIME BUILDING

35:01.863 --> 35:06.159
GET PICKED APART
BY SNAKES AND VULTURES
WHO SEE A WEAKNESS.

35:08.296 --> 35:10.296
SEEMS LIKE YOU'VE
ALREADY GOT PEOPLE
IN THE ORGANIZATION

35:10.362 --> 35:11.863
FREELANCING
BEHIND YOUR BACK,

35:12.630 --> 35:15.963
RUNNING WHORES OUT
OF YOUR OWN BUILDINGS,
DOING MURDERS.

35:16.030 --> 35:17.863
PEOPLE LOYAL TO MY FATHER.

35:17.930 --> 35:19.996
MANY OF THEM.

35:20.813 --> 35:22.197
I CAN COUNT ON YOU, YES?

35:22.262 --> 35:23.329
WHAT, AFTER
YOU LIED TO ME?

35:23.396 --> 35:24.963
SAID YOU HAD THE GAS STATION
WHACK HANDLED?

35:25.030 --> 35:27.663
THE GUY CAN'T
EVEN OPEN HIS EYES.

35:29.330 --> 35:31.696
LOOK, THE LAST TIME THERE
WAS AN ARMENIAN JUMP-OFF,

35:31.763 --> 35:34.830
AN OLD WORLD HIT MAN, MARGOS,
CRAWLED OUT OF THE WOODWORK.

35:34.896 --> 35:36.696
A NICE CHOIR GIRL
LIKE YOU.

35:36.763 --> 35:38.930
YOU DON'T WANT
ANY PART OF THAT KIND
OF BLOODBATH.

35:38.996 --> 35:39.996
AND IF HE COULD TALK,

35:40.063 --> 35:41.647
HE'D TELL YOU
THE SAME GODDAMN THING.

35:43.696 --> 35:46.097
I WOULD LIKE
THOSE NAMES, PLEASE.

35:48.262 --> 35:49.963
YOU PAID FOR THEM.

35:50.030 --> 35:52.930
YOU'VE GOT MUCH
BIGGER PROBLEMS
THAN THESE IDIOTS.

36:01.063 --> 36:03.863
ELEANOR WASN'T KIDDING
WHEN SHE SAID SHE HAD
AN EYE FOR DETAIL.

36:04.380 --> 36:07.030
SHE DESCRIBED
HER ATTACKER RIGHT DOWN
TO THE POT MARK.

36:07.097 --> 36:09.963
YEAH, RIGHT BEFORE SHE GOT
MEDEVACED TO CEDARS.

36:10.030 --> 36:11.763
YEAH. SAID
THE GUY HAD THE B.O.
OF A CADAVER.

36:11.830 --> 36:15.229
IF YOU TWO CAN STAVE
OFF TINA'S PAPARAZZI,
START ON SKID ROW.

36:15.296 --> 36:16.362
I DON'T GET IT.

36:16.429 --> 36:17.730
THIS WOMAN CAN
HAVE ANYTHING SHE WANTS.

36:17.796 --> 36:20.097
IS SAVING A FEW
BUCKS WORTH A COUPLE
OF STAB WOUNDS?

36:20.163 --> 36:21.696
WHEN IT COMES TO LOUIS,
GUCCI, AND FENDI.

36:21.763 --> 36:23.963
COACH, PRADA, CHANEL.

36:24.030 --> 36:25.563
YOU KNOW, AND
IF YOU'RE ON A BUDGET,
DOONEY AND BOURKE.

36:25.629 --> 36:27.730
AND EVERY TIME
HER BAG PASSES OFF
AS THE REAL THING

36:27.796 --> 36:28.896
WHEN ALL OF HER
FRIENDS ARE PAYING

36:28.963 --> 36:31.296
THROUGH THE NOSE
ON RODEO DRIVE, SHE WINS.

36:31.463 --> 36:33.063
YOU KNOW, IT'S
THE THRILL OF THE KILL.

36:33.130 --> 36:34.429
ARE THEY HEARING
THEMSELVES?

36:34.496 --> 36:35.496
IT'S A GIRL THING.

36:35.563 --> 36:36.763
YOU GUYS JUST DON'T GET IT.

36:36.830 --> 36:38.262
YEAH, IT'D BE LIKE US
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND

36:38.329 --> 36:39.629
WHY YOU GUYS LOVE
YOUR BALLS SO MUCH

36:39.696 --> 36:42.008
THAT YOU GOT TO PLAY
POCKET POOL ALL THE TIME.

36:46.262 --> 36:48.130
HERNAN JUST TEXTED ME.

36:48.197 --> 36:50.262
EVERYTHING WENT
SMOOTH ON HIS END.

36:50.329 --> 36:51.730
GOT PROPS FOR GETTING
HIS PEOPLE OUT.

36:51.796 --> 36:52.696
CALLED FOR A MEET TONIGHT.

36:52.763 --> 36:54.362
HE'S GOT SOME INTEL.

36:54.429 --> 36:57.563
BETTER BE WORTHWHILE
AFTER THE ASS REAMING
I JUST TOOK.

36:58.329 --> 36:59.163
I'LL GET THE TEAM.

36:59.229 --> 37:01.463
NO NEED FOR EVERYONE.
I'LL TAKE RONNIE.

37:02.429 --> 37:03.229
OK.

37:04.663 --> 37:07.362
THE CHECK YOU GAVE
ME ON SHANE TODAY,
I HEARD YOU.

37:08.279 --> 37:09.696
AS LONG AS HE'S
ON YOUR TEAM,

37:09.763 --> 37:11.030
I'LL MAKE IT WORK.

37:11.097 --> 37:14.563
IF IT WAS UP TO ME,
YOU'D BE STAYING, TOO.

37:18.130 --> 37:20.396
YOU'RE OUT OF HERE.

37:20.463 --> 37:22.229
IT'S A DONE DEAL.

37:22.296 --> 37:25.529
CLAUDETTE'S BEEN
PLAYING YOU SINCE
THE DAY I SHOWED UP.

37:25.596 --> 37:26.930
SHE FIGURED YOU'D
BE EASIER TO HANDLE

37:26.996 --> 37:28.696
IF YOU THOUGHT THERE
WAS A FUTURE HERE,

37:28.763 --> 37:31.575
MEANWHILE ORCHESTRATING
THINGS SO THERE WON'T BE.

37:34.529 --> 37:36.163
I'M REALLY SORRY, MAN.

37:36.229 --> 37:37.596
I WISH THERE
WAS SOMETHING I COULD DO.

37:37.663 --> 37:39.030
YOU GAVE
IT TO ME STRAIGHT.

37:39.097 --> 37:40.463
THAT'S BIG.

37:43.030 --> 37:44.929
WE'LL BE
WORKING TOGETHER
FOR A WHILE YET.

37:46.246 --> 37:48.597
CLAUDETTE'S NOT THE ONLY
PLAYER AT THE TABLE.

37:52.863 --> 37:53.963
I JUST DON'T GET IT.

37:54.030 --> 37:55.496
YOU RISK YOUR LIFE
FOR SOMETHING
THAT'S A KNOCK-OFF

37:55.563 --> 37:58.024
OF SOMETHING THAT'S
ALREADY A KNOCK-OFF.

37:58.229 --> 37:58.930
YEAH, TO HOLD WHAT?

37:58.996 --> 38:00.763
TAMPONS
AND THE REST OF THEIR
GIRL SHIT AROUND?

38:00.830 --> 38:02.496
GET A LUNCHBOX.
WHACK A MUGGER
WITH ONE OF THOSE,

38:02.563 --> 38:04.163
AT LEAST YOU'LL
DRAW SOME BLOOD.

38:04.229 --> 38:05.563
CHICKS ARE NUTS.

38:06.629 --> 38:10.477
AFRICAN AMERICAN MALE, 20s,
I.D. JUNETEENTH FREEMAN.

38:10.513 --> 38:11.529
OUT ON PAROLE,

38:11.596 --> 38:13.063
FOUND UNCONSCIOUS
IN AN ALLEYWAY

38:13.130 --> 38:14.963
WITH HIS TESTICLES
CUT OFF.

38:15.030 --> 38:16.963
YEAH, SOME MEX IS
PROBABLY CARTING
HIS DUNDEENS

38:17.030 --> 38:18.663
AROUND IN A KNOCK-OFF
LOUIS VUITTON.

38:18.730 --> 38:19.629
AND PAID FOR IT
WITH HIS MONEY.

38:19.696 --> 38:21.262
IT'S NOT
THE ONLY CASTRATION.

38:21.329 --> 38:23.396
THERE'S ANOTHER ONE
UP AT MISSION CROSS.

38:23.463 --> 38:25.930
AFRICAN-AMERICAN ALSO.
I NEED YOU TO FOLLOW UP.

38:25.996 --> 38:27.063
MISSING BAGS.

38:27.130 --> 38:28.707
MAYBE YOU BOYS
CAN RELATE, TOO.

38:29.930 --> 38:32.197
WOMEN CAN BE
THE COLDEST WINTER EVER.

38:32.262 --> 38:34.529
YEAH, NO SHIT.

38:37.963 --> 38:39.463
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.

38:39.529 --> 38:41.930
JUST ANOTHER DIRTY DAY
AT THE OFFICE.

38:44.830 --> 38:46.996
WHOO-HOO, THAT'S SOME
PERFUME YOU'RE WEARING.

38:47.063 --> 38:48.730
PAPA CHANEL
OVER HERE DECIDED

38:48.796 --> 38:50.596
TO THROW HOMEMADE
SHITBALLS AT US.

38:50.663 --> 38:53.097
YEAH, BUT NOT BEFORE
WE HAD TO HAUL HIM OUT
OF THE SEWER.

38:53.163 --> 38:54.296
I'LL TAKE THEM.
YOU GUYS GET CLEANED UP.

38:54.362 --> 38:55.796
NO, NO, NO.
DON'T DENY ME
THE PLEASURE

38:55.863 --> 38:58.363
OF THROWING HIS SKANKY
ASS IN THE CAGE.

39:04.596 --> 39:07.063
HEY, MAN,
WANNA SWING BY A DIVE
AND TAKE THE EDGE OFF?

39:09.063 --> 39:11.396
WHAT? I EXTEND AN INVITE,
YOU THROW A SHADE?

39:11.463 --> 39:13.563
COME ON, MAN.
WHAT'S THAT ABOUT?

39:21.963 --> 39:24.463
I KNOW WHAT
YOU DID TO LEM,

39:25.429 --> 39:26.663
SO DON'T HANG AT ME.

39:26.730 --> 39:28.163
ALL RIGHT?

39:28.229 --> 39:31.163
VIC HAD TO SPIN WHAT HAPPENED
LIKE I'M THE ANTI-CHRIST?

39:32.229 --> 39:33.563
BECAUSE HE KNOWS THAT
IF IT WASN'T FOR HIM,

39:33.629 --> 39:35.329
LEM WOULD STILL
BE ALIVE TODAY.

39:35.396 --> 39:36.963
AND THAT IS
THE GOD'S HONEST TRUTH.

39:37.030 --> 39:39.197
VIC DIDN'T PULL THE PIN
ON THAT GRENADE, DID HE?

39:39.262 --> 39:40.830
THAT WAS ALL YOU.

39:40.896 --> 39:42.262
WHAT HAPPENED
WAS A TRAGEDY,

39:42.329 --> 39:44.262
BUT IT WAS ALSO
GODDAMN INEVITABLE.

39:44.329 --> 39:45.529
YOU EVEN START
ANY HORSESHIT

39:45.596 --> 39:47.097
ABOUT HOW YOU WERE
PROTECTING ALL OF US,

39:47.163 --> 39:49.229
I WILL THROW DOWN
WITH YOU RIGHT NOW.

39:49.296 --> 39:50.696
I DON'T WANT
TO FIGHT WITH YOU.

39:50.763 --> 39:52.763
MAN, I GOT NO BEEF
WITH YOU AT ALL.

39:52.830 --> 39:53.830
WHAT ABOUT
THIS JOURNAL, HUH?

39:53.896 --> 39:55.262
YOU WRITE
ALL THIS SHIT DOWN,

39:55.329 --> 39:57.463
EVERYTHING ON PAPER
THAT WE HAVE DONE

39:57.529 --> 39:58.763
AND YOU'RE TRYING
TO BLACKMAIL US--

39:58.830 --> 39:59.830
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

39:59.896 --> 40:01.362
WHAT AM I MISSING?

40:01.429 --> 40:03.262
DID VIC TELL YOU
ABOUT IT? HUH?

40:03.329 --> 40:05.329
OR DID YOU
ACTUALLY READ IT?

40:05.396 --> 40:06.963
ARE YOU TELLING ME
HE'S LYING TO ME?

40:07.030 --> 40:09.362
NO. NO.
I WROTE IT DOWN.

40:09.429 --> 40:11.329
ALL 24 PAGES.

40:11.396 --> 40:13.612
EVERY GOD AWFUL THING.

40:15.963 --> 40:19.362
WHY DON'T YOU ASK VIC
TO SHOW YOU PAGE ONE?

40:20.197 --> 40:21.863
HE BURNED IT.

40:23.030 --> 40:24.696
YOU KNOW WHY?

40:24.763 --> 40:28.296
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T
WANT ANYONE READING
THE FIRST PARAGRAPH,

40:28.463 --> 40:30.696
ABOUT HOW HE SHOT
AND KILLED TERRY

40:30.763 --> 40:33.030
WHILE I STOOD THERE
AND WATCHED.

40:33.097 --> 40:37.112
LOOK, I HAVE BEEN
LYING, COVERING UP,

40:37.979 --> 40:40.063
BLEEDING OUT
OF MY GODDAMN ANUS,

40:40.130 --> 40:43.080
MAN, FOR 3 YEARS
TRYING TO PROTECT HIM.

40:45.362 --> 40:48.830
IF YOU EVER GET
TIRED OF VIC WALKING
YOU AROUND ON A LEASH

40:49.646 --> 40:51.713
AND YOU WANT
TO HEAR THE REAL
AND THE RAW...

40:53.630 --> 40:54.596
CALL ME.

41:00.730 --> 41:01.913
THIS BUILDING HERE.

41:04.129 --> 41:04.862
ARE YOU SURE
THIS IS RIGHT?

41:04.929 --> 41:06.763
THE CAPTAIN'S APPLIED
FOR A WARRANT.

41:06.829 --> 41:09.063
THIS PLACE IS GOING
TO GET SHUT DOWN TOMORROW
OR THE NEXT DAY.

41:09.129 --> 41:10.862
IT'S THE LAST CHANCE.

41:14.613 --> 41:15.430
HELLO?

41:15.496 --> 41:16.463
HI.

41:16.530 --> 41:18.029
WHAT YOU LOOK FOR?

41:18.096 --> 41:19.630
MY FRIEND SAID YOU
MIGHT KNOW OF A PLACE

41:19.697 --> 41:21.896
THAT MIGHT
HAVE FRIENDLY CLUTCHES?

41:24.729 --> 41:25.747
YOU COME.

41:34.663 --> 41:36.530
WAIT.

41:40.596 --> 41:41.630
YOU COME.

41:49.013 --> 41:49.996
PLEASE, PLEASE.

41:50.063 --> 41:51.047
OK.

41:57.713 --> 41:58.563
I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THIS.

41:58.630 --> 41:59.697
JUST KEEP
THINKING LOUIS.

41:59.763 --> 42:01.596
BESIDES, I'M PACKING.

42:12.129 --> 42:14.862
LOOK, WE DESERVE IT
AFTER THE DAY WE HAD,
RIGHT?

42:14.929 --> 42:16.063
HELL, YEAH.

42:16.129 --> 42:17.797
WE GOT PELTED
WITH SHITBALLS
THIS AFTERNOON.

42:17.862 --> 42:20.846
I'VE HAD PUKE
ALL OVER ME FIRST
THING THIS MORNING.

42:21.263 --> 42:22.363
WE DESERVE THIS EVERYDAY.

42:23.380 --> 42:25.296
I GET NEW PRADA NEXT WEEK.
YOU COME BACK.

42:25.363 --> 42:26.430
I GIVE YOU GOOD DEAL.

42:26.496 --> 42:28.763
NEXT WEEK MIGHT NOT WORK.

42:43.347 --> 42:44.779
HERNAN WAS A NO-SHOW.

42:46.296 --> 42:47.763
HE PASS ALONG
ANY INTEL TO THE GIRL?

42:47.829 --> 42:50.063
WHY THE SALVAS
ARE LOOKING TO BEEF
UP THEIR FIREPOWER?

42:50.129 --> 42:51.296
NO SPECIFICS.

42:51.363 --> 42:53.630
ONLY THAT
SOMETHING MAJOR
WAS ABOUT TO GO DOWN.

42:53.697 --> 42:54.996
SAW THE CAPTAINS
AND THE BYZ LATS,

42:55.063 --> 42:57.697
SET A MEETING
FOR TOMORROW NIGHT,
NEGOTIATE TERMS.

42:57.763 --> 42:59.896
NOW HERNAN WILL HAVE
A SEAT AT THE TABLE.

42:59.962 --> 43:02.862
NO. HE'S ON A PLANE TO
EL SALVADOR RIGHT NOW.

43:02.929 --> 43:04.896
DON'T KNOW WHEN
HE'S COMING BACK.

43:04.962 --> 43:07.896
WELL, THERE GOES
OUR BEST LEAD
IN THE SAN MARCOS CASE.

43:07.962 --> 43:10.596
WHICH MEANS WE
WENT THROUGH ALL
THAT GUN SHOP BULLSHIT

43:10.663 --> 43:12.330
FOR NO GODDAMN REASON.

43:12.396 --> 43:14.163
HIATT GOT IN A JAM
WITH CLAUDETTE.

43:14.629 --> 43:17.029
WE'RE NO CLOSER TO BREAKING
THE SAN MARCOS MURDERS

43:17.096 --> 43:19.463
OR KNOWING WHAT THE
SALVADORANS ARE GOING
TO DO WITH THOSE GUNS.

43:19.530 --> 43:21.846
WHY WOULD HE JERK
US OFF LIKE THAT?

43:23.229 --> 43:26.896
THEY SENT HIM TO EL SALVADOR
TILL THE HEAT DIES DOWN.

43:26.962 --> 43:28.363
WAY I SEE IT,

43:28.980 --> 43:31.396
HERNAN FIGURED
THAT CHOPPED-UP GUY
IS THE SNITCH.

43:31.463 --> 43:34.730
FRAME THE GUY
TO THROW SUSPENSION
OFF OF HIMSELF.

43:34.797 --> 43:36.697
SALVA BOSSES
HAD HIM KILLED,

43:36.763 --> 43:38.230
MADE HERNAN DUMP THE BODY.

43:38.707 --> 43:40.453
???

43:42.140 --> 43:43.490
????

43:45.512 --> 43:46.520
HE'S IN ALL THE WAY NOW.

43:47.725 --> 43:49.161
NOTHING ELSE
MAKES SENSE.

43:51.246 --> 43:53.430
WELL, THE GUY HE GOT
DEAD CHOSE THE LIFE.

43:53.447 --> 43:54.914
PROBABLY HAD IT COMING.

43:55.496 --> 43:57.946
YEAH, BUT HERNAN'S
GOING TO LIVE WITH WHAT
HE DID NOW.

43:59.663 --> 44:00.880
NO DIFFERENT THAN
WHEN YOU SHOT TERRY.

44:02.447 --> 44:03.763
HAD TO BE DONE, RIGHT?

44:11.430 --> 44:12.446
SHANE TELL YOU THAT?

44:12.647 --> 44:15.422
PAGE ONE OF SHANE'S
MEMOIRS WASN'T EXACTLY
NEW INFORMATION.

44:16.796 --> 44:18.862
IT'S DIFFICULT TO PROVE,
FORTUNATELY FOR YOU.

44:24.130 --> 44:24.996
I WISH YOU'D HAVE BEEN
STRAIGHT WITH ME

44:25.813 --> 44:27.246
INSTEAD OF LIVING
A SECRET EVERY DAY.

44:27.396 --> 44:28.896
I COULD HAVE LOOKED
OUT FOR YOU BETTER.

44:32.646 --> 44:35.663
WHAT I NEED
TO KNOW IS WHEN...

44:37.480 --> 44:39.196
WE CAN FINALLY LEAVE
THIS ALL IN THE PAST...

44:41.063 --> 44:41.929
WHERE IT BELONGS.

45:00.713 --> 45:03.262
IT'S QUITE
A CUT JOB YOU DID ON
THOSE 2 BLACK DUDES.

45:03.263 --> 45:04.727
BET THE OTHER ONE
PANCAKE AND HIS JEWELS

45:04.730 --> 45:06.256
ARE HALFWAY
TO ALASKA BY NOW.

45:06.296 --> 45:07.962
WELL, IT WAS
MAYBE TOO MUCH.

45:10.646 --> 45:12.229
I DIDN'T HAVE TIME
TO MAKE BETTER DECISION.

45:13.696 --> 45:15.896
WELL, I'M
CERTAIN YOU GOT
YOUR POINT ACROSS.

45:19.679 --> 45:21.479
YOU WILL ALSO FIND
THE NAMES AND ADDRESSES

45:21.496 --> 45:23.975
OF THE MEN RESPONSIBLE
FOR WHAT HAPPENED
AT THE GAS STATION.

45:24.446 --> 45:25.597
WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?

45:26.447 --> 45:27.418
IT DOESN'T DO ME MUCH
GOOD WITHOUT EVIDENCE

45:27.446 --> 45:28.705
IMPLICATING THEM
IN THE CRIME.

45:29.513 --> 45:31.662
THEY'RE PREPARED TO PROVIDE
ANY DETAILS YOU NEED.

45:32.379 --> 45:35.329
THEY'RE
GOING TO CONFESS,
JUST LIKE THAT?

45:37.446 --> 45:38.395
NO.

45:38.946 --> 45:40.703
FOR THE SAKE
OF THEIR FAMILIES

45:40.779 --> 45:41.863
AND THEIR CHILDREN
BACK HOME.

45:43.279 --> 45:45.129
THEY KNOW THE ARMENIAN WAY,
THEY SUFFER FIRST.

45:48.379 --> 45:50.697
THAT'S AN HONORABLE FIRST,
GIVING UP YOUR OWN TRIBE.

45:51.213 --> 45:52.997
EVEN IF IT'S
YOUR WORST ENEMY,

45:53.013 --> 45:54.563
DIFFERENCES GET
SETTLED IN THE HOUSE.

45:55.080 --> 45:57.379
YOU WANT TO CURE CANCER,
YOU CUT IT OUT.

45:59.579 --> 46:00.880
IT'S ONLY
A MATTER OF TIME

46:00.946 --> 46:02.680
BEFORE REZIAN
FINDS OUT YOUR FATHER'S
OUT OF THE GAME.

46:03.046 --> 46:05.579
IF HE HADN'T ALREADY,
AND WHEN HE DOES,

46:05.646 --> 46:07.562
HE'S GOING TO COME
AFTER YOU WITH EVERYTHING
HE'S GOT.

46:08.479 --> 46:10.679
AND YOU'RE NOT READY
FOR THAT.

46:10.746 --> 46:12.204
I DON'T CARE HOW MANY
BALLS YOU GOT DANGLING

46:12.246 --> 46:13.396
FROM YOUR REARVIEW MIRROR.

46:13.763 --> 46:15.313
YOU THINK THIS
IS WHAT I WANT?

46:15.480 --> 46:17.146
THIS IS FOR MY FATHER.

46:17.213 --> 46:18.746
OH, COME ON.
JUST BECAUSE YOUR
FATHER WAS IN THE LIFE

46:18.812 --> 46:20.480
DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE TO BE
DADDY'S LITTLE GANGSTER.

46:20.547 --> 46:22.513
MY FATHER'S
NOT A GANGSTER.

46:22.580 --> 46:25.879
HE'S A MAN WHO SURVIVES,
WHO TAUGHT ME HISTORY

46:25.946 --> 46:27.513
AT THE DINNER TABLE
EVERY NIGHT ABOUT ARMENIA,

46:27.580 --> 46:29.213
ABOUT THE PROMISES
OF FREEDOM.

46:29.280 --> 46:31.679
ALL THESE PROMISES
THAT WERE ALWAYS BROKEN.

46:31.746 --> 46:33.314
HE MADE ME UNDERSTAND
THE DIFFERENCE

46:33.380 --> 46:35.209
BETWEEN THE FUTURE
AND THE PAST.

46:35.913 --> 46:38.846
EVERYTHING WAS TAKEN
FROM MY PEOPLE.

46:38.913 --> 46:41.363
HE TAUGHT ME
NEVER TO LET THAT
HAPPEN TO US AGAIN.

46:42.079 --> 46:44.046
SO, I WON'T.

46:44.113 --> 46:45.996
I WON'T LET
THAT HAPPEN TO HIM.

46:46.113 --> 46:49.446
MY FATHER STILL
HAS A LOT OF MEN
LOYAL TO HIM.

46:51.079 --> 46:53.479
AND NOW I HAVE YOU.
