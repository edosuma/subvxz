06:30.431 --> 06:33.060
...before his

06:30.431 --> 06:33.060
parachute accident.

06:34.895 --> 06:36.897
I'm so sorry.

06:34.895 --> 06:36.897
Parachute accident.

06:36.938 --> 06:38.232
What a horrible way to go.

06:38.273 --> 06:40.567
Not really.

06:40.608 --> 06:42.694
He was asleep

06:40.608 --> 06:42.694
in the backyard

06:42.736 --> 06:45.822
and this paratrooper

06:42.736 --> 06:45.822
landed on him.

06:45.864 --> 06:49.201
Oh! He didn't feel a thing.

06:51.703 --> 06:53.372
Maybe now would be

06:51.703 --> 06:53.372
a good time

06:53.412 --> 06:55.665
to take a look at Edna's

06:53.412 --> 06:55.665
most recent bungee adventure.

06:55.707 --> 06:58.126
Oh!

07:01.838 --> 07:05.342
Cowabunga!

07:05.384 --> 07:08.178
(Becky)

07:05.384 --> 07:08.178
'Whoa, that's amazing!'

07:08.220 --> 07:10.305
(Danny)

07:08.220 --> 07:10.305
'I'm thinking you don't need

07:08.220 --> 07:10.305
a big early-bird dinner'

07:10.347 --> 07:12.432
'before doing something

07:10.347 --> 07:12.432
like that, Edna.'

07:13.934 --> 07:15.977
You know, Edna..

07:16.019 --> 07:17.604
I see you do

07:16.019 --> 07:17.604
something like that

07:17.645 --> 07:20.481
and I see you here in person,

07:17.645 --> 07:20.481
and you're so full of life.

07:20.523 --> 07:22.192
I mean,

07:20.523 --> 07:22.192
maybe my husband's right.

07:22.234 --> 07:24.819
Maybe there is something

07:22.234 --> 07:24.819
to this risk-taking thing.

07:26.029 --> 07:28.198
Looks like someone's

07:26.029 --> 07:28.198
seen the light.

07:28.240 --> 07:30.242
I'll tell you.

07:30.284 --> 07:32.953
Why don't you two

07:30.284 --> 07:32.953
come bungee jumping

07:32.994 --> 07:36.456
with me next week?

07:36.497 --> 07:40.210
Well, what

07:36.497 --> 07:40.210
do you say, Stretch?

07:40.252 --> 07:42.296
Well, I'm not

07:40.252 --> 07:42.296
a scaredy-cat

07:42.337 --> 07:43.755
now but when it comes

07:42.337 --> 07:43.755
to bungee jumping

07:43.797 --> 07:46.049
I've got two words

07:43.797 --> 07:46.049
for you.

07:46.091 --> 07:47.508
Me-ow.

07:49.303 --> 07:51.846
What are you scared of?

07:51.888 --> 07:54.182
It's safe, and it's fun!

07:54.224 --> 07:56.143
Well, Edna, I don't know

07:54.224 --> 07:56.143
about Stretch here

07:56.184 --> 07:57.560
but you talked me

07:56.184 --> 07:57.560
into it.

07:57.602 --> 07:58.937
Oh, good.

07:58.979 --> 08:01.648
Next week, you and I

07:58.979 --> 08:01.648
are going bungee jumping.

08:01.689 --> 08:04.525
- Oh, no, you're not.

08:01.689 --> 08:04.525
- Oh, yes, she is.

08:04.567 --> 08:07.446
Didn't you hear her?

08:04.567 --> 08:07.446
I'll turn it up.

08:07.487 --> 08:09.448
[helicopter whirring]

08:14.453 --> 08:17.205
[piano music]

08:18.290 --> 08:20.000
- Hi, honey.

08:18.290 --> 08:20.000
- Hi, sweetheart.

08:20.041 --> 08:21.709
- How was your day?

08:20.041 --> 08:21.709
- Oh, terrific. It was great.

08:21.751 --> 08:22.836
I dropped the boys off

08:21.751 --> 08:22.836
at nursery school

08:22.877 --> 08:24.212
did some grocery shopping..

08:24.254 --> 08:25.880
Oh, by the way,

08:24.254 --> 08:25.880
you're not bungee jumping.

08:25.922 --> 08:27.632
The band came over,

08:25.922 --> 08:27.632
we worked on this little tune--

08:27.674 --> 08:29.092
Wait a second.

08:29.134 --> 08:30.969
Did you just say

08:29.134 --> 08:30.969
I'm not bungee jumping?

08:31.011 --> 08:32.971
Yeah. The band came over,

08:31.011 --> 08:32.971
we did this really cool tune.

08:33.013 --> 08:35.390
It kind of

08:33.013 --> 08:35.390
has a Shaft vibe.

08:35.432 --> 08:37.100
[imitates tune]

08:37.142 --> 08:39.019
That's it? We're not

08:37.142 --> 08:39.019
gonna talk about it?

08:39.060 --> 08:42.272
We just did.

08:39.060 --> 08:42.272
I said it's a Shaft vibe.

08:42.314 --> 08:43.398
I mean the bungee jumping.

08:43.440 --> 08:45.150
Oh, that,

08:43.440 --> 08:45.150
the bungee jumping.

08:45.192 --> 08:47.694
Why, I think we pretty much

08:45.192 --> 08:47.694
talked that out.

08:47.735 --> 08:49.237
No, no, no. Wait a second.

08:47.735 --> 08:49.237
Wait a second.

08:49.279 --> 08:51.739
You've talked it out.

08:49.279 --> 08:51.739
I'm just getting warmed up.

08:51.781 --> 08:53.116
Oh, come on, sweetheart.

08:53.158 --> 08:54.284
Jumping off a bridge

08:54.326 --> 08:55.410
attached to

08:54.326 --> 08:55.410
a little rubber band?

08:55.452 --> 08:56.495
That isn't you.

08:56.536 --> 08:57.787
I mean,

08:56.536 --> 08:57.787
you're a talk show host.

08:57.829 --> 08:59.206
The riskiest thing

08:57.829 --> 08:59.206
you've ever done is

08:59.247 --> 09:02.583
try Ed Asner's carrot cake.

09:02.625 --> 09:04.169
Well, what happened

09:02.625 --> 09:04.169
to taking risks?

09:04.211 --> 09:05.586
Feeling alive.

09:05.628 --> 09:08.048
Taking the everyday-ness

09:05.628 --> 09:08.048
out of the everyday?

09:08.089 --> 09:11.592
Well, that was me.

09:08.089 --> 09:11.592
This is you. You're a mother.

09:11.634 --> 09:13.761
You're a father!

09:13.803 --> 09:15.555
This is a complete

09:13.803 --> 09:15.555
double standard.

09:15.596 --> 09:17.265
Oh, come on. This is not

09:15.596 --> 09:17.265
a double standard.

09:17.307 --> 09:19.476
There are just some things

09:17.307 --> 09:19.476
that I can do that you can't.

09:21.644 --> 09:24.231
Well, this ain't

09:21.644 --> 09:24.231
one of 'em.

09:24.272 --> 09:26.649
I'm bungee jumping.

09:24.272 --> 09:26.649
End of discussion.

09:26.691 --> 09:27.984
No.

09:28.026 --> 09:30.195
No, this discussion

09:28.026 --> 09:30.195
isn't over

09:30.237 --> 09:32.572
until I say it's over.

09:32.613 --> 09:34.199
Now, it's over.

09:36.659 --> 09:38.245
[exhales]

09:42.623 --> 09:45.335
Michelle, how can you

09:42.623 --> 09:45.335
sit there in just a T-shirt?

09:45.377 --> 09:48.088
The furnace broke,

09:45.377 --> 09:48.088
and the house is freezing.

09:48.129 --> 09:50.382
Yeah, you better put this on

09:48.129 --> 09:50.382
before you get sick.

09:50.424 --> 09:52.842
What are you talking about?

09:50.424 --> 09:52.842
I'm boiling.

09:52.884 --> 09:55.095
Boiling?

09:55.136 --> 09:56.388
Ow!

09:55.136 --> 09:56.388
Whoo!

09:56.430 --> 09:59.182
Put another

09:56.430 --> 09:59.182
shrimp on the Barbie.

09:59.224 --> 10:02.018
If only we could

09:59.224 --> 10:02.018
take her temperature.

10:02.060 --> 10:05.439
Hey, we're in luck.

10:02.060 --> 10:05.439
A thermometer in my parka.

10:05.480 --> 10:07.524
What are the odds?

10:07.566 --> 10:09.984
We better get you

10:07.566 --> 10:09.984
into bed immediately.

10:10.026 --> 10:11.319
But I feel fine.

10:11.361 --> 10:15.156
Well, all sick people

10:11.361 --> 10:15.156
start off feeling fine.

10:17.784 --> 10:21.788
Oh, my gosh.

10:17.784 --> 10:21.788
116!

10:21.829 --> 10:23.206
Is that bad?

10:23.248 --> 10:26.293
Not if you're

10:23.248 --> 10:26.293
a rump roast.

10:26.334 --> 10:29.796
Sounds to me like...

10:26.334 --> 10:29.796
Shmedrick's disease.

10:29.837 --> 10:31.423
Shmedrick's disease?

10:31.465 --> 10:34.468
Uh-oh, D.J., the next

10:31.465 --> 10:34.468
sign of Shmedrick's.

10:34.509 --> 10:36.136
She's getting the spots.

10:36.177 --> 10:38.972
Spots? What spots?

10:39.013 --> 10:41.224
These spots.

10:43.017 --> 10:45.895
They're on

10:43.017 --> 10:45.895
my pillow, too!

10:45.937 --> 10:48.273
Whoo! That stuff

10:45.937 --> 10:48.273
spreads fast.

10:48.315 --> 10:50.191
Steph, it's definitely

10:48.315 --> 10:50.191
Shmedrick's.

10:50.233 --> 10:52.110
I mean, she's showing

10:50.233 --> 10:52.110
the first three signs.

10:52.152 --> 10:55.071
Fever, red spots,

10:52.152 --> 10:55.071
vomiting.

10:55.113 --> 10:56.906
I didn't throw up.

10:56.948 --> 11:01.119
Uh-oh. The next sign...

10:56.948 --> 11:01.119
memory loss.

11:01.161 --> 11:03.288
Well, thank God,

11:01.161 --> 11:03.288
you've got two loving sisters

11:03.330 --> 11:05.457
that care for you

11:03.330 --> 11:05.457
and make you comfortable

11:05.499 --> 11:08.418
and nurse you

11:05.499 --> 11:08.418
back to health.

11:08.460 --> 11:09.628
Oh, there you are.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.338
I had to turn down

11:09.669 --> 11:11.338
your thermostat.

11:11.379 --> 11:13.089
Did you know some chucklehead

11:11.379 --> 11:13.089
turned it up to 100--

11:13.131 --> 11:16.301
Kimmy, is there a particular

11:13.131 --> 11:16.301
reason you're over here?

11:16.343 --> 11:18.303
Oh, yeah. I need to borrow

11:16.343 --> 11:18.303
a couple things.

11:18.345 --> 11:19.554
It's my turn

11:18.345 --> 11:19.554
to cook dinner

11:19.596 --> 11:21.222
and my dad wants

11:19.596 --> 11:21.222
Beef Wellington.

11:21.264 --> 11:23.057
Oh. What do you need?

11:23.099 --> 11:25.644
Beef and whatever

11:23.099 --> 11:25.644
the heck Wellington is.

11:27.228 --> 11:29.481
Listen, Kimmy, just take

11:27.228 --> 11:29.481
whatever you want.

11:29.523 --> 11:31.774
Now, if you'll

11:29.523 --> 11:31.774
excuse us..

11:31.816 --> 11:33.943
Hey, Rip Van Runt.

11:33.985 --> 11:35.612
Isn't it a little early

11:33.985 --> 11:35.612
for beddy-bye?

11:35.654 --> 11:38.573
I've got Shmedrick's disease.

11:38.615 --> 11:41.576
Really? I had that

11:38.615 --> 11:41.576
when I was ten.

11:41.618 --> 11:43.286
Somehow I doubt that.

11:43.328 --> 11:46.039
You're right. It was

11:43.328 --> 11:46.039
chicken pox, and I was eight.

11:46.080 --> 11:48.166
No, wait a minute.

11:46.080 --> 11:48.166
It wasn't me it was my cousin--

11:48.208 --> 11:50.251
Goodbye, Kimmy.

11:50.293 --> 11:52.379
Geez, you share

11:50.293 --> 11:52.379
one childhood memory..

11:53.880 --> 11:56.341
When is dad coming home?

11:56.383 --> 11:59.177
Uh, Michelle,

11:56.383 --> 11:59.177
about this disease..

11:59.219 --> 12:01.971
See, it's a minor illness

11:59.219 --> 12:01.971
for people our age.

12:02.013 --> 12:03.264
But if a grown-up gets it

12:03.306 --> 12:05.642
or even hears you

12:03.306 --> 12:05.642
talking about it..

12:05.684 --> 12:07.477
Well, then..

12:07.519 --> 12:09.229
...something happens.

12:09.270 --> 12:11.272
- Right, D.J.?

12:09.270 --> 12:11.272
- Yeah.

12:11.314 --> 12:13.149
Uh, it's terrible.

12:13.191 --> 12:16.194
Um, they go completely bald.

12:16.236 --> 12:20.323
You know that, uh,

12:16.236 --> 12:20.323
Captain Picard on "Star Trek?"

12:20.365 --> 12:22.825
Shmedrick's.

12:22.867 --> 12:24.285
So how do I get better?

12:24.327 --> 12:26.287
Just stay in bed

12:24.327 --> 12:26.287
until tomorrow.

12:26.329 --> 12:29.374
Luckily, you only have

12:26.329 --> 12:29.374
24-hour Shmedrick's.

12:29.416 --> 12:30.625
If I have to stay in bed

12:30.667 --> 12:32.960
that means

12:30.667 --> 12:32.960
I'll miss the concert.

12:34.421 --> 12:36.755
Oh, no.

12:36.797 --> 12:39.300
We didn't even

12:36.797 --> 12:39.300
think of that.

12:39.342 --> 12:41.844
That ticket's gonna

12:39.342 --> 12:41.844
go to waste.

12:41.886 --> 12:43.930
If only you knew someone

12:41.886 --> 12:43.930
who was sitting home tonight

12:43.971 --> 12:47.684
with no plans and already

12:43.971 --> 12:47.684
had her coat on.

12:48.518 --> 12:50.353
Do you wanna go, Steph?

12:50.395 --> 12:53.231
Me? Well, let's see.

12:50.395 --> 12:53.231
No plans.

12:53.273 --> 12:56.610
And look at that,

12:53.273 --> 12:56.610
a coat on.

12:56.651 --> 12:58.027
Dad's home.

12:58.069 --> 12:59.862
Uh, thanks for the ticket,

12:58.069 --> 12:59.862
Michelle. Got to go.

12:59.904 --> 13:02.407
And, uh, just stay in bed.

12:59.904 --> 13:02.407
Don't tell anyone anything.

13:02.449 --> 13:04.284
- Yeah.

13:02.449 --> 13:04.284
- 'Wait.'

13:04.325 --> 13:06.286
You guys have been

13:04.325 --> 13:06.286
so good to me

13:06.327 --> 13:08.622
I've got to

13:06.327 --> 13:08.622
tell you the truth.

13:08.663 --> 13:11.124
I really didn't care

13:08.663 --> 13:11.124
about the Counting Cars.

13:11.165 --> 13:13.126
Crows!

13:13.167 --> 13:16.630
All I wanted to do was something

13:13.167 --> 13:16.630
grown-up with you guys.

13:16.671 --> 13:18.715
You get to do

13:16.671 --> 13:18.715
all kinds of fun stuff

13:18.757 --> 13:21.342
and I always feel

13:18.757 --> 13:21.342
left out.

13:21.384 --> 13:23.219
Really?

13:23.261 --> 13:24.638
You do?

13:24.679 --> 13:26.681
You guys are so cool.

13:26.723 --> 13:30.268
I want to grow up

13:26.723 --> 13:30.268
and be just like you.

13:31.519 --> 13:34.188
Oh, rats!

13:34.230 --> 13:37.066
We were so close.

13:38.025 --> 13:41.362
Michelle, you're fine.

13:41.404 --> 13:42.739
There's nothing

13:41.404 --> 13:42.739
wrong with you.

13:42.781 --> 13:45.533
You mean I don't

13:42.781 --> 13:45.533
have Shmedrick's?

13:45.575 --> 13:48.453
No. Mr. Shmedrick

13:45.575 --> 13:48.453
is my biology teacher.

13:51.623 --> 13:53.416
We made the whole thing up.

13:53.458 --> 13:55.376
We were just mad because

13:53.458 --> 13:55.376
you weaseled that ticket

13:55.418 --> 13:57.086
away from Stephanie.

13:57.128 --> 13:58.755
Yeah. Here.

13:58.797 --> 14:00.965
You go to the concert.

14:01.007 --> 14:02.425
No. You guys go.

14:02.467 --> 14:05.679
You're the one who really

14:02.467 --> 14:05.679
liked Counting Cats.

14:05.720 --> 14:08.181
- Crows!

14:08.222 --> 14:09.599
Thanks, Michelle.

14:09.641 --> 14:11.142
Hey, and we promise

14:09.641 --> 14:11.142
next weekend

14:11.184 --> 14:12.352
the three of us

14:11.184 --> 14:12.352
will go out

14:12.393 --> 14:13.894
and do something

14:12.393 --> 14:13.894
really grown-up.

14:13.936 --> 14:17.398
Get pierced and tattooed?

14:17.440 --> 14:19.359
Uh, how about

14:17.440 --> 14:19.359
a PG movie?

14:19.400 --> 14:23.613
With mature themes

14:19.400 --> 14:23.613
and adult situations?

14:23.655 --> 14:25.198
- Come on out of there.

14:23.655 --> 14:25.198
- Yeah.

14:28.284 --> 14:29.536
Beck. Beck,

14:28.284 --> 14:29.536
I gotta talk to you

14:29.577 --> 14:31.329
before you go out

14:29.577 --> 14:31.329
and do something crazy.

14:31.371 --> 14:32.872
Okay, but make it fast

14:31.371 --> 14:32.872
'cause I have to jump off

14:32.913 --> 14:34.957
a bridge in an hour.

14:34.999 --> 14:36.125
Listen, I know why

14:34.999 --> 14:36.125
you're doing this.

14:36.167 --> 14:37.293
You're trying

14:36.167 --> 14:37.293
to get back at me

14:37.335 --> 14:38.628
for all the times

14:37.335 --> 14:38.628
I made you worry.

14:38.670 --> 14:40.714
Well, you know what?

14:38.670 --> 14:40.714
It worked. I'm worried.

14:40.755 --> 14:43.550
You win. Sit down.

14:40.755 --> 14:43.550
Relax. Have a muffin.

14:44.843 --> 14:48.221
Jess, this has

14:44.843 --> 14:48.221
nothing to do with you.

14:48.262 --> 14:51.182
I'm doing this for that

14:48.262 --> 14:51.182
little girl back in Nebraska.

14:51.224 --> 14:52.975
"Low Board" Donaldson.

14:53.017 --> 14:56.229
Is that your cousin

14:53.017 --> 14:56.229
with one eyebrow?

14:56.270 --> 14:58.272
- That's Celeste.

14:56.270 --> 14:58.272
- Oh oh oh.

14:58.314 --> 15:00.149
I'm Low Board.

15:00.191 --> 15:02.193
When I was ten, I went

15:00.191 --> 15:02.193
to the public swimming pool

15:02.235 --> 15:03.778
with all my friends

15:02.235 --> 15:03.778
and we decided that

15:03.820 --> 15:05.864
we would jump off

15:03.820 --> 15:05.864
the high diving board.

15:05.905 --> 15:07.281
Well, I climbed

15:05.905 --> 15:07.281
all the way to the top

15:07.323 --> 15:09.743
I took one look down

15:07.323 --> 15:09.743
and I chickened out.

15:09.784 --> 15:11.703
By the time I got back

15:09.784 --> 15:11.703
down to the bottom

15:11.745 --> 15:12.871
I had a new nickname.

15:12.912 --> 15:15.122
- "Low Board."

15:12.912 --> 15:15.122
- Hmm.

15:15.164 --> 15:16.624
You know, I can relate

15:15.164 --> 15:16.624
to that actually.

15:16.666 --> 15:18.334
You won't believe this,

15:16.666 --> 15:18.334
I got my nickname

15:18.376 --> 15:19.878
at a swimming pool, too.

15:19.919 --> 15:22.129
"Shallow End" Tanner.

15:24.048 --> 15:26.217
College sophomores

15:24.048 --> 15:26.217
can be so cruel.

15:29.470 --> 15:31.180
I'll, uh..

15:29.470 --> 15:31.180
I'll be in the car.

15:32.932 --> 15:34.934
Beck, think about it,

15:32.932 --> 15:34.934
jumping off a diving board

15:34.975 --> 15:36.728
is not the same

15:34.975 --> 15:36.728
as jumping off a bridge.

15:36.770 --> 15:40.607
One makes a big splash,

15:36.770 --> 15:40.607
the other makes a big splat.

15:40.648 --> 15:42.525
Jess, this is just

15:40.648 --> 15:42.525
something I have to do.

15:42.567 --> 15:43.818
No, breathing is something

15:42.567 --> 15:43.818
you have to do.

15:43.860 --> 15:45.695
Eating is something

15:43.860 --> 15:45.695
you have to do.

15:45.737 --> 15:48.239
Refilling the cream dispenser

15:45.737 --> 15:48.239
is something you have to do.

15:48.281 --> 15:50.784
This is something

15:48.281 --> 15:50.784
that you don't have to do.

15:50.825 --> 15:52.744
Honey, I'm gonna do it.

15:52.786 --> 15:54.036
And if you don't

15:52.786 --> 15:54.036
understand why

15:54.078 --> 15:56.623
then you don't

15:54.078 --> 15:56.623
understand me.

15:59.041 --> 16:01.920
I don't understand it.

15:59.041 --> 16:01.920
Am I wrong here?

16:01.961 --> 16:04.672
- Yes.

16:01.961 --> 16:04.672
- Who asked you?

16:04.714 --> 16:07.300
Jess, now you know how Becky

16:04.714 --> 16:07.300
feels while she's home worrying

16:07.341 --> 16:09.928
while you're out

16:07.341 --> 16:09.928
doing your Motocross stuff.

16:09.969 --> 16:13.180
Why is she worried about me?

16:09.969 --> 16:13.180
I'm not worried about me.

16:13.222 --> 16:15.308
Jess, don't you get it?

16:15.349 --> 16:16.893
Listen,

16:15.349 --> 16:16.893
you're my best friend

16:16.935 --> 16:19.729
so I'm gonna tell you this

16:16.935 --> 16:19.729
from my heart, okay?

16:19.771 --> 16:21.230
She's worried about you

16:19.771 --> 16:21.230
for the same reason

16:21.272 --> 16:23.190
you're worried about her.

16:23.232 --> 16:26.235
You care more about

16:23.232 --> 16:26.235
her life than your own life.

16:26.277 --> 16:28.154
Because, let's face it, buddy

16:28.195 --> 16:30.364
she makes your life

16:28.195 --> 16:30.364
worth living.

16:31.866 --> 16:34.076
Oh, Joseph,

16:31.866 --> 16:34.076
that was mature

16:34.118 --> 16:36.704
insightful,

16:34.118 --> 16:36.704
and very sensitive.

16:36.746 --> 16:37.956
Thank you.

16:37.997 --> 16:40.416
Okay. Now, cartoons.

16:41.584 --> 16:43.544
[imitates Popeye's chuckle]

16:53.471 --> 16:54.806
[sighs]

16:54.848 --> 16:56.557
Well, I can't believe

16:54.848 --> 16:56.557
I'm saying this

16:56.599 --> 16:59.185
but right after

16:56.599 --> 16:59.185
the news break

16:59.226 --> 17:02.355
Edna and I will be

16:59.226 --> 17:02.355
bungee jumping off this bridge.

17:02.396 --> 17:04.732
Yes, that's right,

17:02.396 --> 17:04.732
they're both gonna be helplessly

17:04.774 --> 17:05.942
plummeting hundreds of feet

17:05.984 --> 17:07.652
down, down, down,

17:05.984 --> 17:07.652
off this bridge

17:07.694 --> 17:10.029
toward rock-solid rock,

17:07.694 --> 17:10.029
only to be snapped

17:10.070 --> 17:13.115
from the jaws of death

17:10.070 --> 17:13.115
at the last possible second.

17:13.157 --> 17:14.367
Don't go away.

17:15.159 --> 17:16.995
And we're clear.

17:17.036 --> 17:20.122
Hey, Stilts,

17:17.036 --> 17:20.122
what is this horse hockey

17:20.164 --> 17:22.416
about the jaws of death?

17:22.458 --> 17:24.878
We have a perfect

17:22.458 --> 17:24.878
safety record!

17:24.919 --> 17:27.421
Oh, I'm sorry, Edna.

17:24.919 --> 17:27.421
It was for dramatic effect.

17:27.463 --> 17:29.590
It makes

17:27.463 --> 17:29.590
for great television.

17:29.632 --> 17:31.718
And a terrified co-host.

17:35.638 --> 17:37.181
(Becky)

17:35.638 --> 17:37.181
'Whoa.'

17:39.809 --> 17:41.143
You know..

17:41.185 --> 17:43.396
I'm also the terrified

17:41.185 --> 17:43.396
producer of this show

17:43.437 --> 17:46.273
and I'm gonna make a teensy

17:43.437 --> 17:46.273
little change in this segment.

17:46.315 --> 17:48.735
Edna,

17:46.315 --> 17:48.735
you're flying solo.

17:48.776 --> 17:51.571
Uh, excuse me,

17:48.776 --> 17:51.571
Ms. Producer.

17:51.612 --> 17:54.281
Remember, Edna jumped by herself

17:51.612 --> 17:54.281
on our show just last week.

17:54.323 --> 17:56.993
That's no problem.

17:54.323 --> 17:56.993
I'll, um..

17:57.035 --> 18:00.038
I'll do it

17:57.035 --> 18:00.038
in my bikini!

18:02.540 --> 18:06.210
Well, I'm back to being

18:02.540 --> 18:06.210
"Low Board" Donaldson again.

18:06.252 --> 18:07.420
Oh.

18:07.461 --> 18:10.297
I'd rather be

18:07.461 --> 18:10.297
"Low Board" than..

18:10.339 --> 18:12.258
..."Gunk in a Gorge."

18:12.299 --> 18:13.968
I'm going to get some

18:12.299 --> 18:13.968
Danish and some make-up

18:14.010 --> 18:15.469
and something else.

18:15.511 --> 18:17.013
See ya.

18:19.515 --> 18:21.726
[instrumental music]

18:21.768 --> 18:23.269
[engine revving]

18:30.443 --> 18:33.947
Jess, honey,

18:30.443 --> 18:33.947
what are you doing here?

18:33.988 --> 18:35.823
Listen, Beck..

18:35.865 --> 18:37.033
I totally understand you now.

18:37.075 --> 18:38.701
Joey explained

18:37.075 --> 18:38.701
everything to me.

18:38.743 --> 18:40.119
Honey, you're

18:38.743 --> 18:40.119
listening to a man

18:40.160 --> 18:42.162
who sleeps in

18:40.160 --> 18:42.162
"Power Ranger" pajamas.

18:43.998 --> 18:48.335
The reason I'm so worried is

18:43.998 --> 18:48.335
because I love you so much.

18:48.377 --> 18:50.588
In loving you so much

18:48.377 --> 18:50.588
I realized that

18:50.630 --> 18:52.590
you have the right

18:50.630 --> 18:52.590
to do anything you want.

18:52.632 --> 18:54.926
To live your life as full

18:52.632 --> 18:54.926
and rich as you want.

18:54.968 --> 18:56.176
I mean, if you

18:54.968 --> 18:56.176
wanna take a risk

18:56.218 --> 18:57.386
take a risk.

18:57.428 --> 18:59.346
I have no right

18:57.428 --> 18:59.346
to tell you not to.

18:59.388 --> 19:01.474
Yes, you do.

18:59.388 --> 19:01.474
You have every right.

19:01.515 --> 19:02.892
You're an American.

19:02.934 --> 19:04.351
You have the right

19:02.934 --> 19:04.351
to free assembly.

19:04.393 --> 19:05.770
You have a right

19:04.393 --> 19:05.770
to an attorney

19:05.812 --> 19:07.271
if you choose to have one.

19:07.313 --> 19:08.522
And you have

19:07.313 --> 19:08.522
the right to stop me

19:08.564 --> 19:10.483
from making

19:08.564 --> 19:10.483
a horrible mistake.

19:10.524 --> 19:12.819
So, what you're saying

19:10.524 --> 19:12.819
is you're afraid?

19:12.860 --> 19:15.947
In a word, deathly.

19:15.989 --> 19:18.908
Listen, bottom line is,

19:15.989 --> 19:18.908
do you really want to do this?

19:20.660 --> 19:22.495
Well..

19:22.536 --> 19:24.330
...yes.

19:24.371 --> 19:26.206
I would love to take

19:24.371 --> 19:26.206
a fearless leap

19:26.248 --> 19:28.751
and spread my wings

19:26.248 --> 19:28.751
and fly.

19:28.793 --> 19:32.088
And if I actually had wings,

19:28.793 --> 19:32.088
I would do it.

19:32.130 --> 19:34.381
Well, then it's up to you.

19:34.423 --> 19:38.218
You can stay up here and be

19:34.423 --> 19:38.218
"Low Board" Donaldson forever

19:38.260 --> 19:40.013
or you can put all your

19:38.260 --> 19:40.013
fears behind you

19:40.054 --> 19:43.349
and you can experience

19:40.054 --> 19:43.349
the thrill of a lifetime.

19:45.351 --> 19:46.894
It does look exciting.

19:46.936 --> 19:50.481
If I had the opportunity,

19:46.936 --> 19:50.481
I wouldn't turn it down.

19:53.526 --> 19:54.944
Hey.

19:54.986 --> 19:56.529
Okay, folks. We're on

19:54.986 --> 19:56.529
the air in 20 seconds.

19:56.570 --> 20:00.199
- Off the set, please.

19:56.570 --> 20:00.199
- Alright. So?

20:00.240 --> 20:01.993
Are you gonna jump or

20:00.240 --> 20:01.993
do we we have to go with..

20:02.035 --> 20:04.328
Whoa! Edna's in a thong!

20:04.370 --> 20:05.955
And she's looking

20:04.370 --> 20:05.955
pretty hot.

20:05.997 --> 20:09.667
And we're ready

20:05.997 --> 20:09.667
in 5, 4, 3, 2..

20:09.709 --> 20:11.919
Well, we're back,

20:09.709 --> 20:11.919
San Francisco

20:11.961 --> 20:14.421
and there's been a slight

20:11.961 --> 20:14.421
change of plans.

20:14.463 --> 20:16.841
Instead of me

20:14.463 --> 20:16.841
jumping with Edna

20:16.883 --> 20:18.926
we thought it would

20:16.883 --> 20:18.926
be a fun surprise

20:18.968 --> 20:21.095
if I were to share

20:18.968 --> 20:21.095
the thrill of a lifetime

20:21.137 --> 20:24.015
with my husband

20:21.137 --> 20:24.015
Jesse Katsopolis.

20:24.057 --> 20:25.725
What? Huh? What?

20:25.766 --> 20:28.477
Uh, Beck, I'm not sure

20:25.766 --> 20:28.477
the audience is ready

20:28.519 --> 20:30.938
for such a fun surprise

20:28.519 --> 20:30.938
at this hour in the morning.

20:30.980 --> 20:32.314
I mean, maybe they had

20:30.980 --> 20:32.314
a big breakfast--

20:32.356 --> 20:33.941
I think the audience

20:32.356 --> 20:33.941
is ready for a fun--

20:33.983 --> 20:35.442
- Sausage.

20:33.983 --> 20:35.442
- No. No sausage.

20:35.484 --> 20:36.569
I think they're ready

20:35.484 --> 20:36.569
for a fun surprise.

20:36.610 --> 20:38.112
It is sweeps week.

20:38.154 --> 20:39.822
Just tighten him up

20:38.154 --> 20:39.822
nice and snug. Safe and snug.

20:39.864 --> 20:42.116
What-what are these things

20:39.864 --> 20:42.116
they're putting?

20:42.158 --> 20:43.910
Beck, can't we just

20:42.158 --> 20:43.910
work up to this thing?

20:43.951 --> 20:45.619
You know, like,

20:43.951 --> 20:45.619
jump off something small

20:45.661 --> 20:47.997
and then work our way up,

20:45.661 --> 20:47.997
like, like, like the curb.

20:48.039 --> 20:49.207
Camera, can you get this?

20:49.248 --> 20:51.042
Whoa! That's far down there.

20:51.084 --> 20:53.127
And then we..

20:51.084 --> 20:53.127
And then we go.

20:53.169 --> 20:54.336
Come on, honey,

20:53.169 --> 20:54.336
you were the one that said

20:54.378 --> 20:55.504
this was a thrill

20:54.378 --> 20:55.504
of a lifetime.

20:55.546 --> 20:56.964
Yeah, your lifetime.

20:55.546 --> 20:56.964
Not mine.

20:57.006 --> 20:58.216
Alright, you lovebirds.

20:58.257 --> 21:01.969
Over the railing

20:58.257 --> 21:01.969
and into the gorge.

21:02.011 --> 21:05.098
Ready, honey?

21:02.011 --> 21:05.098
Here we go.

21:05.139 --> 21:07.975
Honey, rubber bands

21:05.139 --> 21:07.975
snap on occasion.

21:08.017 --> 21:09.227
Well..

21:09.268 --> 21:11.062
It's a thrill..

21:11.104 --> 21:13.064
...of a lifetime.

21:13.106 --> 21:14.107
You're not afraid,

21:13.106 --> 21:14.107
are you?

21:14.148 --> 21:16.776
In a word,

21:14.148 --> 21:16.776
deathly.

21:26.535 --> 21:28.246
(Becky)

21:26.535 --> 21:28.246
'Oh, my God.'

21:28.287 --> 21:29.830
(Becky and Jess)

21:28.287 --> 21:29.830
Have mercy!

21:31.457 --> 21:33.000
[both screams]

21:37.630 --> 21:39.506
[Becky screaming]

21:37.630 --> 21:39.506
Oh, my God!

21:43.677 --> 21:46.513
(Becky)

21:43.677 --> 21:46.513
Wow! That was incredible.

21:46.555 --> 21:49.308
What a rush!

21:49.349 --> 21:51.393
Honey, are you okay?

21:51.435 --> 21:53.771
(Jesse)

21:51.435 --> 21:53.771
I don't know.

21:53.813 --> 21:57.191
Yeah. I'll tell you

21:53.813 --> 21:57.191
when my stomach gets here.

21:57.233 --> 22:00.694
Okay, yes.

21:57.233 --> 22:00.694
Good, I'm fine. I'm fine.

22:00.736 --> 22:02.321
(Becky)

22:00.736 --> 22:02.321
Oh, Jess..

22:02.362 --> 22:06.993
I love you so much!

22:02.362 --> 22:06.993
I'm so glad I did this!

22:07.034 --> 22:10.663
- Wanna do it again?

22:07.034 --> 22:10.663
- Do you?

22:11.705 --> 22:13.958
- Nah.

22:24.135 --> 22:25.469
