00:02.036 --> 00:02.203
.

00:02.236 --> 00:03.204
- Hope got into a little bit of
trouble back home.

00:05.073 --> 00:06.440
- I didn't steal any money.

00:06.474 --> 00:08.609
- She explained it all to me.
Small town drama.

00:08.642 --> 00:10.411
- What did HQ say about
those oxygen bottles?

00:10.444 --> 00:12.113
- I called and left
a message this morning,

00:12.146 --> 00:13.581
but I think I might
have the wrong number.

00:13.614 --> 00:16.217
- Yeah, you have an explanation
for all of it.

00:16.250 --> 00:19.120
- Congratulations,
Captain Casey.

00:19.153 --> 00:20.821
[applause]

00:20.854 --> 00:23.157
- Starting immediately Captain
Casey will be your go-to

00:23.191 --> 00:25.359
for all
personnel-related issues.

00:25.393 --> 00:26.794
- Chief told me
he'd back you up

00:26.827 --> 00:30.464
if you wanted to make
captain yourself.

00:30.498 --> 00:32.300
- I'm in no rush.

00:37.105 --> 00:39.107
- Impressive stack of forms
on your desk.

00:39.140 --> 00:40.641
You having a paper drive?

00:40.674 --> 00:43.244
- That's the paperwork I get to
deal with thanks to these.

00:43.277 --> 00:46.447
- I was thinking of giving up
bacon for health reasons,

00:46.480 --> 00:48.849
but Trudy has two rules
for men.

00:48.882 --> 00:51.485
No cats,
and no vegetarians.

00:51.519 --> 00:53.354
- I'd add sandals to that list.

00:53.387 --> 00:55.223
- If we put together a list
like that for women,

00:55.256 --> 00:57.325
you would murder us.

00:57.358 --> 01:00.194
- That's not true.
Try it.

01:01.629 --> 01:03.164
- Do not.

01:03.197 --> 01:05.533
- Oh, no, please.
I'm interested.

01:05.566 --> 01:08.302
[tense music]

01:08.336 --> 01:10.204
- Um...

01:10.238 --> 01:12.140
Maybe just--
- Come on, Otis.

01:12.173 --> 01:13.841
What's on the list?

01:13.874 --> 01:17.345
- No...racists?

01:17.378 --> 01:18.579
[all snickering]

01:18.612 --> 01:19.647
- Is that a question?

01:19.680 --> 01:22.383
You're not sure?

01:22.416 --> 01:25.119
- Never had a chance.
- Mm-mm.

01:25.153 --> 01:26.587
- Hey.

01:26.620 --> 01:29.423
all: Oh!

01:29.457 --> 01:31.325
- What a nice welcome.

01:31.359 --> 01:33.127
- Yeah, nothing cheers up
this crowd like paychecks.

01:33.161 --> 01:34.595
- Sylvie Brett, there you go.
- Thank you.

01:34.628 --> 01:36.864
- Matthew Casey.
- Yep.

01:36.897 --> 01:38.866
- Hey your first
Captain's paycheck.

01:38.899 --> 01:40.668
- Oh, must be nice.

01:40.701 --> 01:43.204
- Christopher Herrmann.

01:43.237 --> 01:46.207
There you go, Kelly.

01:46.240 --> 01:47.441
Happy payday, everyone.

01:47.475 --> 01:48.876
- Thank you.

01:48.909 --> 01:50.611
- Uh...forgot someone.

01:50.644 --> 01:52.546
- Oh, there wasn't a check
in the package for you,

01:52.580 --> 01:54.682
so I figured you must
have direct deposit.

01:54.715 --> 01:58.552
- Nope, I get a check every
week, just like everyone else.

01:58.586 --> 02:00.354
Or at least, I did until today.

02:00.388 --> 02:02.256
- I'm not sure what happened,

02:02.290 --> 02:04.325
but I'll call over
to payroll right now.

02:04.358 --> 02:06.527
I'm really sorry about that.

02:09.363 --> 02:11.665
- Don't worry.
She'll find it.

02:13.567 --> 02:17.271
- Hey, yo, you're blocking
emergency vehicles here!

02:17.305 --> 02:19.940
- Deliveries go around back
to the kitchen door!

02:19.973 --> 02:21.409
- Not this.
It's too big.

02:21.442 --> 02:23.277
- Holy smokes.
What is that?

02:23.311 --> 02:26.914
- Couldn't tell you.
Belongs to a Brian Zvonecek.

02:26.947 --> 02:29.517
- Hey, Cruz.
Go find Otis, would you?

02:29.550 --> 02:32.720
- Hey, Otis!
Get out here!

02:33.954 --> 02:35.589
What'd Otis do now?

02:35.623 --> 02:38.559
- Ordered something
all the way from Osaka.

02:42.363 --> 02:46.334
- Is this what I think it is?

02:46.367 --> 02:47.668
- You tell us.

02:47.701 --> 02:49.570
- What is it, Otis?

02:49.603 --> 02:53.707
- This, gentlemen,
is the future.

02:53.741 --> 02:55.643
[alarm sounds]

02:55.676 --> 02:57.545
- Truck 81, Ambulance 61.
Person injured...

02:57.578 --> 02:59.947
- Hey, Cruz, can you drag
that in for me?

02:59.980 --> 03:02.516
Real gentle.
Thanks, pal.

03:02.550 --> 03:05.519
[sirens wailing]

03:05.553 --> 03:08.522
[dramatic music]

03:08.556 --> 03:15.596
*

03:23.571 --> 03:24.738
- You guys better hurry.

03:24.772 --> 03:26.574
- Where's the victim?

03:26.607 --> 03:27.675
- Right this way with
an attempted break-in.

03:27.708 --> 03:29.009
Didn't work out for the kid.

03:29.042 --> 03:30.311
- Got him real good.

03:30.344 --> 03:33.714
- [screaming]

03:33.747 --> 03:35.649
- Oh, my God.

03:35.683 --> 03:38.486
- [screaming]

03:38.519 --> 03:42.323
- 81 to Main, you better
send out Rescue Squad.

03:42.356 --> 03:45.493
- [screaming]

03:50.364 --> 03:52.400
[sirens wailing]

03:52.433 --> 03:54.468
- All right.
Stop moving, buddy.

03:54.502 --> 03:56.770
The more you move,
the worse it gets.

03:56.804 --> 03:59.507
[siren wailing]

03:59.540 --> 04:02.343
- Watch your backs.

04:02.376 --> 04:05.346
[tense music]

04:05.379 --> 04:07.615
*

04:07.648 --> 04:08.782
- Oh!

04:08.816 --> 04:10.451
- He's losing a lot of blood,

04:10.484 --> 04:11.719
and the medics
can't work on him

04:11.752 --> 04:12.853
until we get him
out of that mess.

04:12.886 --> 04:14.388
Truck can get him down here,

04:14.422 --> 04:15.723
but I want Squad
to cut him free.

04:15.756 --> 04:17.625
- No, let's leave him
where he is.

04:17.658 --> 04:20.361
Cruz, grab a Stokes basket,
a rope, and a pulley.

04:20.394 --> 04:21.495
- Copy that.
- What are you doing?

04:21.529 --> 04:22.763
- Gonna reposition
the aerial.

04:22.796 --> 04:24.398
Make it an overhead
anchor point.

04:24.432 --> 04:25.766
We'll take the Stokes basket,

04:25.799 --> 04:27.601
and we'll raise it up
to the victim,

04:27.635 --> 04:29.370
secure him in it, and then
we'll extract the wires.

04:29.403 --> 04:31.505
Strand by strand.
- That'll take way too long.

04:31.539 --> 04:33.507
I Just want to cut
the whole section free,

04:33.541 --> 04:35.609
and bring him down, you can
disentangle him on the ground.

04:35.643 --> 04:37.845
- Casey, you see where that
wire's digging into his leg?

04:37.878 --> 04:39.547
- Yeah, that's why I want
to bring him down,

04:39.580 --> 04:40.781
so the medics can stop
the bleeding.

04:40.814 --> 04:42.383
- I say we should
keep him stable.

04:42.416 --> 04:45.353
Mouch!
Get that ladder up!

04:45.386 --> 04:47.588
- Mouch, scrub that.
Stay where you are.

04:47.621 --> 04:49.490
I'm making the call.

04:49.523 --> 04:52.826
We bring the victim down,
and work on the ground.

04:52.860 --> 04:54.795
- Stokes basket is ready,
Lieutenant.

04:54.828 --> 04:56.830
- No, we don't need it.

04:56.864 --> 04:58.732
Captain says we're gonna
bring the victim down

04:58.766 --> 05:00.601
right now, wire and all.

05:00.634 --> 05:02.670
Grab the bolt cutters,
and head up on the roof.

05:02.703 --> 05:04.405
- [sighs] Copy.
- Herrmann,

05:04.438 --> 05:06.340
let me up on that ladder.

05:06.374 --> 05:08.809
- All right.

05:08.842 --> 05:12.413
*

05:12.446 --> 05:13.814
- Tony,
let's move this dumpster.

05:13.847 --> 05:16.417
- Yeah.

05:16.450 --> 05:23.491
*

05:26.660 --> 05:28.729
- Ready, Lieutenant?
- Go for it.

05:28.762 --> 05:31.732
[saw whirring]

05:31.765 --> 05:37.571
*

05:37.605 --> 05:40.574
- Let me grab the pole.
- Flip it.

05:40.608 --> 05:43.577
[saw whirring]

05:43.611 --> 05:47.881
*

05:47.915 --> 05:50.484
- You got it, Kidd?
- Yeah.

05:50.518 --> 05:53.754
*

05:53.787 --> 05:56.757
- [grunting]

05:56.790 --> 06:00.494
*

06:00.528 --> 06:01.929
- Whoa, whoa.
Wait.

06:01.962 --> 06:05.866
That's it.
Stop.

06:05.899 --> 06:07.601
Hey, watch the barbs.

06:07.635 --> 06:08.836
Wire's under
a lot of tension.

06:08.869 --> 06:10.638
- Got it.

06:10.671 --> 06:14.575
*

06:14.608 --> 06:15.943
Watch it.

06:15.976 --> 06:18.846
- Okay.
Bring him down.

06:18.879 --> 06:21.982
Pulley.

06:22.015 --> 06:24.485
Okay?
- Got it.

06:24.518 --> 06:25.986
- [groans]

06:26.019 --> 06:28.556
- Got it.

06:28.589 --> 06:29.990
[both grunting]

06:30.023 --> 06:32.560
- Damn it.

06:32.593 --> 06:36.997
*

06:37.030 --> 06:38.932
- We got a bleeder.

06:38.966 --> 06:40.768
- Femoral artery.
We need to transport now.

06:40.801 --> 06:42.770
- Let's go.

06:42.803 --> 06:44.905
*

06:44.938 --> 06:48.776
- Nice work.

06:48.809 --> 06:52.212
[indistinct chatter]

06:52.245 --> 06:57.618
*

06:58.652 --> 07:00.554
- Did things seem a little
hostile back there

07:00.588 --> 07:02.189
between Casey and Severide?

07:02.222 --> 07:03.791
- Yeah, Squad always thinks

07:03.824 --> 07:05.559
they know better than
everyone else.

07:05.593 --> 07:06.960
- Okay, thank you, bye.

07:06.994 --> 07:08.762
Hey, Stella.
- Hi.

07:08.796 --> 07:10.664
- That was payroll, and
according to their system

07:10.698 --> 07:11.732
they did issue a check for you,

07:11.765 --> 07:13.567
but it wasn't in the packet,

07:13.601 --> 07:15.869
so they must have messed up
somewhere along the line.

07:15.903 --> 07:18.806
- Someone did, yeah.
- Oh, mistakes happen.

07:18.839 --> 07:21.241
- I will figure
all of this out, I promise.

07:21.274 --> 07:23.210
Maybe it was in another packet.

07:23.243 --> 07:25.679
I will get your check
to you ASAP.

07:25.713 --> 07:27.715
- Yeah.

07:28.882 --> 07:30.851
- [sighs]
Of course it has to be

07:30.884 --> 07:32.686
Stella's check
that goes missing.

07:32.720 --> 07:33.954
She already hates me.

07:33.987 --> 07:35.689
This is only gonna
make it worse.

07:35.723 --> 07:37.057
- She doesn't hate you.
- Oh, please.

07:37.090 --> 07:40.861
I can tell,
even if I have no idea why.

07:42.863 --> 07:45.699
- No way.

07:45.733 --> 07:48.602
- [chuckles]
Oh, yeah.

07:48.636 --> 07:50.971
I had my mom send a bunch
of stuff from Fowlerton.

07:51.004 --> 07:51.972
This was in the box.

07:52.005 --> 07:53.941
- Oh, my God.

07:53.974 --> 07:56.510
Aww.

07:56.544 --> 07:57.845
- Look at what dorks we were.

07:57.878 --> 08:00.614
- Oh, yeah,
you were never a dork.

08:00.648 --> 08:03.717
Oh, that's the year
I got braces.

08:03.751 --> 08:06.820
- You were such a good girl.
- Mm, you weren't.

08:06.854 --> 08:09.690
- [laughs]
Well...

08:13.060 --> 08:15.696
- Herrmann,
have you seen Severide?

08:15.729 --> 08:17.731
- Nah, but come here, Otis
wants to show us something.

08:17.765 --> 08:20.768
[drill whirring]

08:20.801 --> 08:22.670
- What's in the crate?

08:22.703 --> 08:26.006
- Ah.
- Otis says it's the future.

08:26.039 --> 08:29.643
- Hey, Kidd, come on in.
You're gonna want to see this.

08:29.677 --> 08:32.880
Okay, so, a few months back,
I signed up with a manufacturer

08:32.913 --> 08:34.882
to beta test a new piece
of equipment.

08:34.915 --> 08:37.084
- And you didn't
run it by me first?

08:37.117 --> 08:40.120
- No, but I'm personally
liable for the loaner unit,

08:40.153 --> 08:41.989
so I figured I didn't
need your authorization.

08:42.022 --> 08:43.757
- You did.

08:43.791 --> 08:45.058
- Oh, okay.
I understand that now,

08:45.092 --> 08:47.294
but Casey,
you're gonna love this.

08:47.327 --> 08:52.065
Because we're not talking about
some new tool or piece of gear.

08:52.099 --> 08:56.937
This is a whole new class
of firefighting technology.

08:56.970 --> 08:58.138
- Otis, open the box.

08:58.171 --> 09:00.540
- Tony?

09:02.342 --> 09:05.579
[grunting]

09:09.082 --> 09:11.752
Ta-da.

09:11.785 --> 09:13.754
[rousing music]

09:13.787 --> 09:16.957
This is the Kyujo Nakama 250.

09:16.990 --> 09:18.726
- Did you call it Cujo?

09:18.759 --> 09:22.863
- No, I didn't.
This is the Kyujo Nakama.

09:22.896 --> 09:26.166
Which means "The Rescue Pal."

09:26.199 --> 09:28.035
- [groans]

09:28.068 --> 09:29.937
- Okay.

09:29.970 --> 09:33.707
[all groaning softly]

09:33.741 --> 09:35.776
- With all the new
responsibilities

09:35.809 --> 09:38.078
that Casey's got, you're just
gonna drop that in his lap too?

09:38.111 --> 09:39.947
- He's gonna thank me
for this, okay?

09:39.980 --> 09:42.916
This machine is gonna
change everything.

09:42.950 --> 09:44.985
- Sure, by putting us
out of a job.

09:45.018 --> 09:47.688
- Yeah, machines are taking
over fast enough

09:47.721 --> 09:49.122
without traitors like you,
you know,

09:49.156 --> 09:52.059
rolling out
the red carpet for 'em.

09:52.092 --> 09:54.862
*

09:58.065 --> 10:00.901
- Hey.
Victim's gonna pull through.

10:00.934 --> 10:03.637
Never lost consciousness
the whole way to the hospital.

10:03.671 --> 10:05.138
Thought you'd want to know.

10:05.172 --> 10:07.207
- That's great.

10:08.742 --> 10:10.644
- Everything okay?

10:13.446 --> 10:15.716
- Casey...
- Yeah.

10:15.749 --> 10:19.119
- When you escalate a call--
a routine call--

10:19.152 --> 10:21.755
and bring in Squad,
that generally means

10:21.789 --> 10:24.792
the Squad officer is now
in charge of the scene.

10:24.825 --> 10:27.094
- Generally, yes.
But in this case--

10:27.127 --> 10:29.129
- So what's the point of
asking me for my expertise

10:29.162 --> 10:31.732
if you're just gonna pull rank
and make me do things your way?

10:31.765 --> 10:34.902
- Whoa, I--
I didn't pull rank--

10:34.935 --> 10:36.904
- I've worked under a lot
of chiefs and officers,

10:36.937 --> 10:40.407
and I've never seen a good
leader ignore an expert opinion

10:40.440 --> 10:42.009
just because he could.

10:42.042 --> 10:43.777
- Severide, I wasn't
looking for an assessment

10:43.811 --> 10:45.112
of my leadership abilities.

10:45.145 --> 10:47.447
I just came to tell you
about the victim.

10:47.480 --> 10:49.449
[tense music]

10:49.482 --> 10:51.051

10:51.084 --> 10:54.755
Thanks for the update.

11:08.802 --> 11:09.136
.

11:09.169 --> 11:09.569
- We have a problem.

11:11.404 --> 11:12.472
- What is it?

11:12.505 --> 11:14.141
- Nothing life or death,

11:14.174 --> 11:17.144
just I had a little friction
with Severide

11:17.177 --> 11:18.746
on our last call.

11:18.779 --> 11:21.248
I'll spare you the details.
Suffice it to say,

11:21.281 --> 11:23.450
he didn't want
to follow my command.

11:23.483 --> 11:25.452
Now I get it.
He had his opinion

11:25.485 --> 11:27.420
about the rescue,
as he should,

11:27.454 --> 11:29.122
but he put me in a position

11:29.156 --> 11:30.791
where I had to issue
a direct order.

11:30.824 --> 11:33.426
And now he's all bent
out of shape.

11:35.095 --> 11:37.130
You need to talk to him, Chief.

11:37.164 --> 11:39.266
- Me?
- Yeah, I already tried,

11:39.299 --> 11:41.501
but you know,
we were friends, and...

11:41.534 --> 11:43.303
[sighs]

11:43.336 --> 11:46.106
I think it's hard for him
to accept the new dynamic.

11:46.139 --> 11:48.809
- I thought you said
"we" had a problem, Captain.

11:48.842 --> 11:50.811
- Well, it's my problem,
Chief, but--

11:50.844 --> 11:52.312
- Then you should deal with it.

11:52.345 --> 11:53.814
Otherwise, you make
it my problem,

11:53.847 --> 11:56.884
and you might not like
my solution.

11:58.251 --> 12:01.354
I can't have discord
in my command structure.

12:01.388 --> 12:04.357

12:19.572 --> 12:21.308

12:21.341 --> 12:24.244
- Why did Casey have to
overrule you on that?

12:24.277 --> 12:27.347
- Couldn't tell you.

12:27.380 --> 12:30.483
- I mean,
you know I love Casey.

respect for Rescue Squad.

that compartment

I mean, she got in trouble
for stealing at her old job.

12:53.941 --> 12:56.109
- She did not.

12:56.143 --> 12:58.545

about Hope,

in Fowlerton

13:03.884 --> 13:05.418

Accounting already
stopped payment on it.

what she's up to.

- No.

13:18.231 --> 13:19.900
- No, but that's--

13:19.933 --> 13:22.335
- Seems to me that
she is either messing with me,

13:22.369 --> 13:24.171
or she's incompetent.

13:24.204 --> 13:25.605
And neither one
of those things are good.

backwards trying to help you.

You and I have been working
together a long time.

21:34.093 --> 21:36.463
And developed
a certain dynamic.

21:36.496 --> 21:38.365
But just because
the dynamic has changed--

21:38.398 --> 21:40.533
- My plan was better.

21:40.567 --> 21:41.734
- Can I just finish?

21:41.768 --> 21:43.636
- I know
the kid was bleeding out.

21:43.670 --> 21:45.472
The Stokes basket, it wouldn't
have taken that much longer,

21:45.505 --> 21:47.340
and we could've
kept him stable.

21:47.374 --> 21:49.041
Here's a similar rescue.

21:49.075 --> 21:51.778
Utility worker gets his arm
snagged up on a telephone pole.

21:51.811 --> 21:53.446
That's where I got my idea.

21:53.480 --> 21:55.348
- Severide,
are we talking about

21:55.382 --> 21:57.049
the best way to handle a call,
or are you just miffed

21:57.083 --> 22:00.052
because I got my captain's
bugles before you?

22:00.086 --> 22:01.754
- [scoffs]

22:01.788 --> 22:04.457
The victim's gonna
lose his leg.

22:04.491 --> 22:05.658
- What?

22:05.692 --> 22:07.093
- I talked to Maggie
over at Med.

22:07.126 --> 22:08.461
The femoral artery,
it's ruined.

22:08.495 --> 22:10.029
The nerve damage is too great.

22:10.062 --> 22:12.532
They're gonna amputate
first thing in the morning.

22:12.565 --> 22:15.502
- And your plan could've
saved his leg?

22:15.535 --> 22:18.371
You know that for a fact?
- Casey, it was a better plan.

22:18.405 --> 22:20.507
- You have no idea if it
would've made a difference.

22:20.540 --> 22:23.476
Come on.
Nobody can know that.

22:23.510 --> 22:25.445
- Okay.

22:25.478 --> 22:27.780
Should've kept him stable.

the-first-date kind of girl.

22:52.672 --> 22:57.109
- Oh, okay.
I respect that.

22:57.143 --> 22:58.811
- But the thing
at the ambulance

22:58.845 --> 23:03.450
when you smiled at me,
that was kind of a first date.

23:03.483 --> 23:04.884
- Oh, so this would be
like our second date.

23:04.917 --> 23:07.186
- Right.
- Oh, I respect that even more.

23:07.219 --> 23:10.690
- You're very respectful.

23:10.723 --> 23:13.760
- Which is a good reason
for you to invite me

23:13.793 --> 23:15.528
up to your apartment.

23:15.562 --> 23:17.530
- [giggles]

23:17.564 --> 23:21.434
I have two roommates
who are man-children.

23:21.468 --> 23:23.603
- I can handle that.

[cell phone ringing]

23:30.610 --> 23:32.879
That's the hospital.
One second.

*

23:35.515 --> 23:38.918
Hey...

23:38.951 --> 23:41.921
Okay, yeah, yeah.
Be right there.

23:41.954 --> 23:44.591
I am so sorry.
This is a patient emergency.

23:44.624 --> 23:45.825
I have to go deal with this.

23:45.858 --> 23:47.494
- Oh.

23:47.527 --> 23:48.861
- But I had a really
good time tonight.

23:48.895 --> 23:51.731
Can we do this again soon?
Like imminently?

23:51.764 --> 23:56.569
- I'd like that.

23:56.603 --> 23:57.737
- Okay.
Bye.

23:57.770 --> 24:00.673
- Bye.

24:16.923 --> 24:20.560
And the Blackhawks game is on.

24:21.828 --> 24:23.630
- You just solved
all our problems.

24:23.663 --> 24:25.932
- Mm.

24:27.600 --> 24:29.502
[sighs]

24:29.536 --> 24:33.706
I got into this thing
with Brett at work today, and--

24:33.740 --> 24:34.974
- Mm.

24:35.007 --> 24:36.242
- What?

24:36.275 --> 24:38.911
- How about no firehouse talk?

24:38.945 --> 24:40.780
- Yeah, I like it.

24:40.813 --> 24:43.650
You gotta keep work and
personal life separate.

24:43.683 --> 24:45.818
It's the only way to go.

24:45.852 --> 24:47.787
- It's the only way.

24:51.691 --> 24:55.862
[melancholy music]

24:55.895 --> 25:00.667
- So what happens if
I don't pay rent this month?

25:00.700 --> 25:07.239
*

25:08.708 --> 25:10.810
- You keep plying me
with beer and hockey,

25:10.843 --> 25:13.946
you can stay as
long as you want.

25:13.980 --> 25:18.551
*

25:18.585 --> 25:22.722
- You're a good friend.

- [laughs]

25:25.858 --> 25:29.829
*

25:29.862 --> 25:33.065
- All those years I supervised
200 men in that office,

25:33.099 --> 25:36.703
and now I'm answering
to a kid half my age.

25:36.736 --> 25:38.705
I gotta tell you
the truth, baby.

25:38.738 --> 25:40.072
I couldn't be happier.

25:40.106 --> 25:41.974
- Aww, I'm glad
the job's working out.

25:42.008 --> 25:43.710
- Ah.
Enough about the office.

25:43.743 --> 25:46.312
Now how you doing?
Things are going well, huh?

25:46.345 --> 25:48.615
And Matt,
first with that medal,

25:48.648 --> 25:50.950
and now with the promotion,
it's like--

25:50.983 --> 25:54.253
- Things are good.
I mean this captain thing is--

25:54.286 --> 25:55.855
It's been an adjustment,

25:55.888 --> 25:57.924
but, you know,
I think it's good for him.

25:57.957 --> 26:00.860
- There he is now.
Senor Capitan.

26:00.893 --> 26:02.294
- Hey, baby.

26:02.328 --> 26:04.597
- Ramon.
- You find Severide?

26:04.631 --> 26:06.332
- I found him.

26:06.365 --> 26:11.103
He thought I needed a lecture
on how to be a firefighter.

26:11.137 --> 26:14.741
Guy's got a serious chip on
his shoulder about my new rank.

26:14.774 --> 26:17.009
- Well, you know how he's not
afraid to buck authority.

26:17.043 --> 26:18.611
And now you're the authority.

26:18.645 --> 26:20.379
- Oh. Great.
And if he keeps it up,

26:20.412 --> 26:22.882
Boden decides
the situation is untenable,

26:22.915 --> 26:24.283
maybe one of us has to go.

26:24.316 --> 26:27.353
- Is it untenable?

26:27.386 --> 26:29.355
- It seems like Severide
just had a strong opinion

26:29.388 --> 26:30.657
about the rescue.

26:30.690 --> 26:32.992
- Yeah, so did I.

26:33.025 --> 26:34.927
What, you think he was right?
- No.

26:34.961 --> 26:38.030
- Matthew, I don't think that's
what she's saying at all.

26:38.064 --> 26:39.999
- Oh, here we go.

26:40.032 --> 26:41.734
- I just think that maybe--
- Here's the thing, Ramon.

26:41.768 --> 26:43.135
For months we had to listen
to what you think.

26:43.169 --> 26:46.806
We're over it.
- Matt!

26:50.176 --> 26:54.947
- Uh...this was obviously
the wrong time for a visit.

26:54.981 --> 26:57.016
- Dad.
- No, that's okay, Gabby.

26:57.049 --> 26:59.786

He's not the enemy, Matt.

27:05.357 --> 27:07.059
And neither am I!

27:07.093 --> 27:09.929
- So everyone else is right,
and I'm wrong.

27:09.962 --> 27:13.666
Got it.

27:13.700 --> 27:15.334
[door opens, closes]

27:21.107 --> 27:21.273
.

27:21.307 --> 27:22.041
- And I didn't say
anything to you

27:24.176 --> 27:25.444
since I know how you feel
about doctors,

27:25.477 --> 27:27.213
but it was actually
a lot of fun.

27:27.246 --> 27:30.116
He's really sweet,
and funny, and smart.

27:30.149 --> 27:33.753
He's already called and texted
a bunch of times, which I love.

27:33.786 --> 27:36.956
We're getting together
again next week.

27:38.224 --> 27:40.259
Are you mad at me?
I should've told you--

27:40.292 --> 27:42.061
- No, no, not at all.

27:42.094 --> 27:44.330
It's just, Casey and I really
went at it last night.

27:44.363 --> 27:46.198
- Oh, I'm sorry.

27:46.232 --> 27:48.434
- I think this whole captain
thing has him stressed out.

27:48.467 --> 27:50.269
- Well, it's a lot
of responsibility.

27:50.302 --> 27:53.205
Maybe he just needs
some time to adjust to it.

27:53.239 --> 27:54.707
- I hope so.

27:54.741 --> 27:56.375
- Oh, my God!

27:56.408 --> 27:59.011
No! No!

27:59.045 --> 28:00.246
- What's the matter, Otis?

28:00.279 --> 28:03.182
- Somebody tampered
with the robot.

28:03.215 --> 28:06.018
They vandalized it!

28:07.386 --> 28:09.021
- Are those lollipops?

28:09.055 --> 28:11.157
- Unbelievable!

28:11.190 --> 28:14.493
How did they even do this
from outside the cage?

28:14.526 --> 28:18.230
- Maybe they reached in with
like a pipe pole or something.

28:18.264 --> 28:20.299
- Like building
a ship in a bottle.

28:20.332 --> 28:22.401
You almost have to admire
their persistence.

28:22.434 --> 28:24.436
- Unless...

28:24.470 --> 28:26.438
they knew the combination.

28:26.472 --> 28:30.176
- Otis, if I wanted to mess
with your little robot friend,

28:30.209 --> 28:32.178
I'd just take a Halligan to it.

Ugh.

28:46.292 --> 28:48.460
- Excuse me, Chief.

28:48.494 --> 28:49.762
- Yeah?

28:49.796 --> 28:51.397
- I'm sorry to bother you,

28:51.430 --> 28:54.466
but is it all right if
I take off for an hour?

28:54.500 --> 28:56.002
- In the middle of a shift?

28:56.035 --> 28:57.837
- Yes.
I...

28:57.870 --> 29:00.039
The thing is, accounting
won't return my calls,

29:00.072 --> 29:01.808
because I've sort of
been harassing them

29:01.841 --> 29:04.243
about Kidd's missing checks,
so I was just gonna show up

29:04.276 --> 29:06.112
and stand there until
they cut her a new one.

29:06.145 --> 29:07.213
- Huh.

29:07.246 --> 29:09.148
- If that's okay with you.

29:09.181 --> 29:13.085
- I do appreciate
a healthy dose of tenacity.

29:13.119 --> 29:14.553
You got an hour.
Get it done.

29:14.586 --> 29:17.790
- Will do.
Thank you, Chief, very much.

29:17.824 --> 29:20.126
- You're welcome.

29:22.895 --> 29:25.197
- Three more seconds.

29:25.231 --> 29:27.299
And...time.

29:27.333 --> 29:30.402
Line them up
according to length.

29:34.874 --> 29:37.276
Who's up next?

29:37.309 --> 29:38.510
Where's Otis?

29:38.544 --> 29:41.413
- On a phone call last I saw.

29:41.447 --> 29:43.850
- Otis, I hope that
was an emergency,

29:43.883 --> 29:45.584
because we're drilling
out here.

29:45.617 --> 29:47.486
- Yeah, it was very important.
I did a little sleuthing,

29:47.519 --> 29:50.322
and I'm 98% sure that
it was Boswell on third shift.

29:50.356 --> 29:51.858
- What was Boswell?

29:51.891 --> 29:55.094
- He's the one
who vandalized Kyujo.

29:56.528 --> 29:59.465
- Otis, pick up the jump rope.

29:59.498 --> 30:02.334
- Captain, he got lollipop
juice on the motherboard.

30:02.368 --> 30:04.070
It could've shorted out.

30:04.103 --> 30:06.105
You oversee all three watches.

30:06.138 --> 30:07.406
You gotta do something
about this.

30:07.439 --> 30:09.241
- Done!

30:11.177 --> 30:13.212
- Here's what I'm gonna do.

30:13.245 --> 30:15.214
Put that thing back
in the crate,

30:15.247 --> 30:18.417
and ship it back to China or
wherever the hell it came from.

30:18.450 --> 30:20.252
- What?
- Now, Otis!

30:20.286 --> 30:23.522
Get it done.

30:23.555 --> 30:25.591
- Yes, Captain.

30:28.928 --> 30:30.829
- Again.

30:38.670 --> 30:42.641
- Hey, Casey.
You okay?

30:42.674 --> 30:45.477
All right, look.
Otis...

30:45.511 --> 30:48.180
well, he's an idiot.

30:48.214 --> 30:51.183
But the robot thing,
I mean, could be

30:51.217 --> 30:53.519
he just wants to make
himself useful, you know?

30:53.552 --> 30:56.188
- He is useful.
He's a firefighter.

30:56.222 --> 30:59.358
- Yeah, but think about it.

30:59.391 --> 31:02.628
I mean, he's been low man
on the truck for a long time.

31:02.661 --> 31:05.297
You know,
maybe he's just looking

31:05.331 --> 31:07.433
for more responsibility.

31:07.466 --> 31:10.436
- Tell him it's overrated.

to Lakeshore anymore.

31:17.709 --> 31:20.246
- Yeah, I wanted to
pick up supplies here

31:20.279 --> 31:23.983
'cause I noticed Med's been
running low on...gauze lately.

31:24.016 --> 31:26.518

I didn't notice that.

31:28.387 --> 31:30.356
Do you know if Dr. Pete Calhoun
is working today?

31:30.389 --> 31:32.624
- Yeah, sure, I'll page him.

31:32.658 --> 31:34.693
- Thanks.

31:34.726 --> 31:36.562
- Dr. Calhoun,
come to the front desk.

31:36.595 --> 31:38.197
- Why didn't you just say
you wanted to swing by

31:38.230 --> 31:39.398
and see Dr. Hottie?

31:39.431 --> 31:40.666
- I wasn't sure if
you'd want to.

31:40.699 --> 31:42.434
And there really
wasn't much gauze

31:42.468 --> 31:43.970
at Med last time
we were there, so--

31:44.003 --> 31:45.704
- Mm-hmm.
Oh.

what are you doing here?

picking up supplies,

31:55.982 --> 31:57.383
so I figured I'd say hi.

31:57.416 --> 31:59.451
- Dr. Calhoun, it's your wife.

She says there's
no parking spaces,

32:01.287 --> 32:04.456

out front for you.

32:04.490 --> 32:05.724

and explain, okay?

Not okay.

- What is wrong with you?

32:11.530 --> 32:14.033
- Hey, come on, let's get
the hell out of here.

[dramatic music]

32:18.237 --> 32:20.973
- How could I be so wrong
about that guy?

32:21.007 --> 32:23.675
- Ugh, I'm sorry.
He's a fool.

32:23.709 --> 32:28.514
- It never even occurred to me
that he might be married.

32:28.547 --> 32:30.282
I'm the fool.

32:30.316 --> 32:32.618
- No.
Hey, no, you are not.

32:32.651 --> 32:34.553
You just tend to see
the best in people,

32:34.586 --> 32:36.355
and maybe...

32:36.388 --> 32:39.625
sometimes ignore the rest.

32:39.658 --> 32:42.661
It's something all your friends
know and love about you.

32:47.399 --> 32:51.237
What?

32:51.270 --> 32:54.506
- Nothing.

32:54.540 --> 32:57.043
Let's just go.

[blender powers down]

33:23.202 --> 33:24.370
- How did--

33:24.403 --> 33:25.804
- I stood in front
of Yvonne's desk

33:25.837 --> 33:27.239
whining until
she got so sick of me

33:27.273 --> 33:29.175
that she wrote it out by hand.

33:29.208 --> 33:31.210
I'm an impressive whiner.

33:31.243 --> 33:34.446
- I guess you are.

33:34.480 --> 33:35.714
Thanks, Hope.

33:35.747 --> 33:38.817
- No problem.

33:38.850 --> 33:42.188
- Gotta hand it to your friend.

33:42.221 --> 33:44.390
She pulled it off.

33:44.423 --> 33:47.326
- I'm glad it worked out.

33:51.397 --> 33:53.432
- Wasn't my best apology.

33:53.465 --> 33:56.768
- Pretty sure that's not
what's bothering her.

34:01.740 --> 34:04.110
- If you two are here to gloat,
take it somewhere else.

34:04.143 --> 34:05.411
- We're not here to gloat.

34:05.444 --> 34:06.512
We're here to
deliver great news.

34:06.545 --> 34:09.515
- Okay.
What?

34:09.548 --> 34:12.684
- We told Casey he ought to
give the robot a second chance.

34:12.718 --> 34:15.254
He said you could keep it.

34:15.287 --> 34:16.855
- Seriously?

34:16.888 --> 34:19.791
- Yes, with the caveat
that you can't send it

34:19.825 --> 34:21.460
into a working fire.

34:21.493 --> 34:23.495
- Well if I can't deploy it
in an actual fire,

34:23.529 --> 34:25.197
then what use is it?

34:25.231 --> 34:28.500
- I could think of plenty
of uses for this.

34:36.508 --> 34:38.877
- Oh, hey!

34:38.910 --> 34:40.846
- [chuckles]

34:40.879 --> 34:43.182
- So, I get to keep my robot,

34:43.215 --> 34:44.783
and you get to keep
disrespecting it?

34:44.816 --> 34:46.752
- Yeah.
It's your devil's bargain.

34:46.785 --> 34:49.888
Besides, you're better
at driving this

34:49.921 --> 34:53.325
than you are at driving that.

34:53.359 --> 34:55.261
- You think I'm a good driver?

- Sure.

Can I have a minute
with your lieutenant?

35:20.919 --> 35:22.854

Sure thing, Casey.

35:22.888 --> 35:24.423
No worries.

Here's your article.

35:35.401 --> 35:37.269
I see what
you're talking about.

35:37.303 --> 35:40.339
It made a lot of sense
to try it that way.

35:43.475 --> 35:46.512
You really think
it would've saved his leg?

35:47.946 --> 35:51.917
- The damage was done
long before we got there.

35:54.286 --> 35:56.622
- So here's the thing,
Severide.

35:56.655 --> 35:58.390
We had a victim bleeding out.

35:58.424 --> 36:00.592
And I had to choose between
the fastest rescue,

36:00.626 --> 36:02.394
and the most cautious one.

36:02.428 --> 36:04.463
I chose speed.

36:04.496 --> 36:08.400
But whatever the outcome,
it's on my shoulders.

36:08.434 --> 36:10.502
I can't have you bucking
the chain of command,

36:10.536 --> 36:13.305
whether or not you think
you know better.

36:13.339 --> 36:16.508
I don't expect you
to be thrilled by my rank.

36:16.542 --> 36:20.446
But you need to respect it.

Not sure how well I'd take it

36:40.432 --> 36:41.833
if the shoe was
on the other foot,

36:41.867 --> 36:43.935
and Severide was telling me
what to do.

36:43.969 --> 36:45.637
- But you ironed it all out?

36:45.671 --> 36:48.574
- The work part of it,
at least.

36:48.607 --> 36:51.443
Might be a while before we take
any fishing trips together.

36:51.477 --> 36:53.679
- Hm.

36:53.712 --> 36:56.882
- How do you find a balance
between being a leader

36:56.915 --> 37:00.386
and being a friend?

37:00.419 --> 37:02.454
- You notice I don't have
a lot of friends.

Heavy is the head
that wears the crown, Casey.

The life of a leader is...

it's a minefield.

navigate it, you let me know.

- I saw you with Boden.

38:01.713 --> 38:03.315
Figured you had captain stuff
to deal with.

38:03.349 --> 38:04.383
Paperwork and all that.

38:04.416 --> 38:06.051
- Paperwork can wait.

38:06.084 --> 38:08.387
I thought we could grab
some breakfast at Yolk.

38:08.420 --> 38:10.055
- Yolk, huh?
- Yeah, why not?

38:10.088 --> 38:11.990
Maybe even invite your dad.

38:12.023 --> 38:13.459
- Ha.

38:13.492 --> 38:16.628
Or maybe just the two of us?

- Yeah.
That's better.

- Yeah.
It is.

Stella seemed pretty happy
about the check, huh?

really well for you.

38:35.447 --> 38:37.416
- For me?

- Yeah, I mean, you got to save
the day for the one person

38:40.452 --> 38:44.690
that, like you said,
had a problem with you.

for anyone.

I'm just glad
it turned out okay.

Because I would really hate
to think that you would mess

38:55.033 --> 38:56.535
with any of my friends here

38:56.568 --> 38:58.704
just to make yourself
look better.
