ran the G-Parks pretty well.

I thought your dad
was on the inside.

04:10.917 --> 04:12.168
When'd he get out?

to have two years left

04:15.964 --> 04:19.300

05:00.508 --> 05:03.511
The names are Patrice Allen,

05:03.553 --> 05:05.972
and this is the pastor
of the church, Martin Frank.

05:06.014 --> 05:08.558
Hmm.

05:08.600 --> 05:10.977
Mm, Allen's
a documented shot-caller.

05:11.019 --> 05:12.645
- Yeah, up-and-comer
with the G-Parks.

05:12.687 --> 05:14.397
He's on the short list
for Wright's seat

05:14.439 --> 05:15.815
at the head of the table.

05:15.857 --> 05:17.442
He took the brunt of the
rounds, which makes us think

05:17.484 --> 05:18.985
he was the intended target.

05:19.027 --> 05:22.572
The pastor just had the bad
luck of standing next to him.

05:22.614 --> 05:24.657
- They didn't have
more security on hand?

05:24.699 --> 05:26.201

to go off, Sarge.

05:32.999 --> 05:34.959

it's a tough crowd,

05:35.001 --> 05:36.336
but we can probably
pull something together.

05:36.378 --> 05:38.880
Yeah, well, the easy answer is,
it's a power play,

05:38.922 --> 05:41.257
but we don't know for sure,
so let's just work it wide.

Yeah, he sounds like
he was a real good man.

A lot of people are
telling us that

06:39.315 --> 06:42.235
he was very good to people,
that he loved to help people,

06:42.277 --> 06:44.279
that he was there.

06:44.320 --> 06:46.406
That sound like him to you?

06:46.448 --> 06:48.408

07:00.795 --> 07:03.131
It doesn't make
that much sense, does it?

07:03.173 --> 07:05.800
Right, and that's why
we need your help.

07:05.842 --> 07:08.094
We need your help, man.

07:10.805 --> 07:15.101
I didn't see who shot him.

07:15.143 --> 07:16.770
Okay.

07:16.811 --> 07:20.607
- But I was with Pastor Frank,
well, before the funeral.

07:22.859 --> 07:25.070
The other guy that got shot
was there too.

07:25.111 --> 07:26.571
Other guy?

Patrice Allen?

07:28.323 --> 07:30.408
Yeah.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.619
He got in a fight with someone.

07:32.660 --> 07:35.538
They were shouting.

07:35.580 --> 07:38.291
And the big guy told him
to watch his back.

07:38.333 --> 07:40.794
A big guy? Okay.

07:40.835 --> 07:43.588
Demar, tell us more
about the big guy.

07:47.133 --> 07:50.553
Ernie Reed, shot caller
for the G-Park Lords,

07:50.595 --> 07:52.972
one of two potential heirs
for Wright's spot

07:53.014 --> 07:56.142
as Universal Elite,
the other being Patrice Allen.

07:56.184 --> 07:58.478
- Demar said he saw
Reed and Allen

07:58.520 --> 07:59.479
arguing before the funeral.

07:59.521 --> 08:00.647
Things got hot.

08:00.689 --> 08:01.690
Reed shouted,
"Watch your back,"

08:01.731 --> 08:02.899
and then he left.

08:02.941 --> 08:04.359
We think Reed circled back?

08:04.401 --> 08:06.152
Or he hired someone to.

08:06.194 --> 08:07.654
Well, without Allen,

08:07.696 --> 08:09.781
Reed knows that
he is next in line.

08:09.823 --> 08:12.742
So maybe they had a shouting
match before the funeral.

08:12.784 --> 08:14.661
Reed gets aggravated.
He's had enough.

08:14.703 --> 08:15.829
He goes home,
picks up his piece,

08:15.870 --> 08:17.956
circles back, takes out Allen.

08:17.997 --> 08:20.417
- Okay, we got online beef,
proof of threats?

08:20.458 --> 08:22.210
No, nothing from gang intel.

08:22.252 --> 08:23.837
- He did four years
in Stateville.

08:23.878 --> 08:24.921
He would not leave
a paper trail.

08:24.963 --> 08:26.506
He's smarter than that.

08:26.548 --> 08:29.384
- Patrol found the abandoned
Durango outside Bedford Park.

08:29.426 --> 08:30.593
We got shell casings?

08:30.635 --> 08:32.512
- No, no,
it was stripped, torched.

08:32.554 --> 08:34.264
There's no VIN, no plates.

08:34.305 --> 08:35.807
So nothing tying it to Reed?

08:35.849 --> 08:38.476
- Well, Reed is a good theory,
but that's all it is.

08:38.518 --> 08:40.353
- It's all circumstantial.
- Mm-hmm.

08:40.395 --> 08:42.647

or his shooter

08:42.689 --> 08:45.025

some questions

know the deceased?

12:56.484 --> 12:58.945

I didn't know him well.

Two people are dead.

I need you to cooperate

13:29.684 --> 13:31.519
I can't make an ID for you.

13:35.523 --> 13:36.983

14:08.390 --> 14:09.641
Hmm.

14:15.480 --> 14:21.236
The shooter was a kid,
Black, 20s, thin, tight hair.

And he had a messed up ear,
a fighter's ear.

dehydrated, crying out.

16:55.557 --> 16:56.558
His mom?

She was at work.

16:59.477 --> 17:00.687
Tell me we have something.

17:00.729 --> 17:03.356
- MAC-10 was handed to us
on a silver platter.

17:03.398 --> 17:04.899
This is the gun that
was used at the church

17:04.941 --> 17:06.401
and to kill Grimes.

17:06.443 --> 17:08.987
- No sign of forced entry.
Grimes probably let him in.

17:09.029 --> 17:10.071

close range,

17:10.113 --> 17:11.865
two to the back of the head.

17:11.906 --> 17:14.743
He was dragged to the tub

- We're gonna get nothing
from forensics.

This is Reed covering his ass.

17:20.373 --> 17:23.043
- Okay, but phone, GPS,
witnesses?

17:23.084 --> 17:24.252
No, we got none of that.

17:24.294 --> 17:26.212
No witnesses, no PODs, no cams.

17:26.254 --> 17:27.464
I tried to get an
exigent Title III

17:27.505 --> 17:29.382
and was told an emphatic no.

17:29.424 --> 17:32.469
- Reed gave us our church
suspect, gave us the gun.

17:32.510 --> 17:35.555
Now he's sitting pretty as the
top man on the South Side.

17:35.597 --> 17:37.140
- All right,
so we're gonna use that angle.

17:37.182 --> 17:39.184
Reed's running the G-Parks now.

17:39.225 --> 17:41.102
He's gonna have to start
getting his product out,

17:41.144 --> 17:43.938
keep the troops happy, or he's
gonna end up getting shot.

17:43.980 --> 17:46.566
I mean, we know how to work
a DTO, so we work it.

We get him on drug conspiracy,
then squeeze him for this.

All right, we know where Reed's
running his product out of?

17:53.281 --> 17:54.407

Okay, so we start there.

17:58.161 --> 17:59.329

to install traps, no cameras.

About as fine
as it could go, I guess.

that we've been friends,

18:24.688 --> 18:27.023
you've only really mentioned
that he was in prison,

18:27.065 --> 18:29.359

I drive his kid around.

20:18.468 --> 20:20.845
- How the hell would that man
trust you with his kids?

20:20.887 --> 20:22.514
Reed's paranoid.

20:22.555 --> 20:25.517
He thinks people are gonna come
for him, his kids,

20:25.558 --> 20:29.646
so he has guys like me
driving to school and back.

20:29.688 --> 20:31.022
So you made a car switch?

20:31.064 --> 20:35.193
- Yes, because he makes us
swap them out.

20:35.235 --> 20:37.320
That's all it is.

- Yeah.

20:38.988 --> 20:41.741
- You sure about that?
- It's a debt.

20:41.783 --> 20:44.577
G-Parks provided me
protection in prison.

you wanna pay back

We'll get Reed's number,
do mudds and tolls,

23:03.216 --> 23:04.551

from there.

23:04.592 --> 23:05.885

you can get any more details,

23:36.458 --> 23:37.751
That's your father.

23:39.544 --> 23:42.589
Reed laid down three bodies.

23:42.630 --> 23:44.007
One of them was a man of God

23:44.049 --> 23:45.800
who died on his own
church steps.

23:45.842 --> 23:47.093
The other one was a father
who was killed

23:47.135 --> 23:49.971
in front of his baby boy.

23:50.013 --> 23:51.598
It doesn't have to be
more complicated than that.

23:51.639 --> 23:53.933
I don't think it is.

23:53.975 --> 23:56.061
Lew is an ex-con.

23:56.102 --> 23:57.854
He's knee deep with Reed.

23:57.896 --> 24:01.024
Far as I'm concerned,
he's a damn good lead.

24:01.066 --> 24:03.401
Let's use them.

24:03.443 --> 24:04.986
Okay.

24:05.028 --> 24:07.113
We'll squeeze him.

24:07.155 --> 24:09.282
Have Lew set up
an intro with Reed,

24:09.324 --> 24:11.326
just a meet and greet.

24:11.368 --> 24:12.952
And it can't be you, Kev.

24:12.994 --> 24:15.038
I mean, you were
outside that church.

24:15.080 --> 24:16.998
It's too risky.

24:17.040 --> 24:18.541
You take it.

24:26.675 --> 24:29.636
<i>[tense music]</i>

24:39.187 --> 24:40.689
It'll be fine.

24:44.818 --> 24:47.487
Reed doesn't know me.

24:47.529 --> 24:49.489
He agreed to meet me,
so we good.

24:49.531 --> 24:56.663

25:00.959 --> 25:03.753
<i>Okay, just play it cool.</i>

25:03.795 --> 25:06.631
<i>We got this.</i>

25:06.673 --> 25:09.092
<i>All right, here we go.</i>

25:09.134 --> 25:15.890
<i>* *</i>

25:22.439 --> 25:23.940
So you had to set a meet?

25:23.982 --> 25:27.193
- This is Dante,
a friend of a friend.

25:27.235 --> 25:30.947
His usual men are out,
so he wants to make a purchase.

25:32.615 --> 25:35.910
- So you telling people
my business?

25:35.952 --> 25:38.204
Only that he should meet you.

25:40.040 --> 25:44.669
- Look, what about
"a month and you're gone"?

25:44.711 --> 25:47.088
I'm here now.

25:47.130 --> 25:48.506
Hmm.

25:48.548 --> 25:50.633
Well, what happened to
"I'm gonna pay off my debts

25:50.675 --> 25:52.719
and be all done"?

25:55.305 --> 25:57.140
<i>Come on, Lew.</i>
<i>You ain't in the game.</i>

25:57.182 --> 25:58.558
<i>You never were.</i>

25:58.600 --> 26:00.852
<i>You only went inside</i>
<i>because you took that fall.</i>

26:00.894 --> 26:03.563
<i>So what are we doing here,</i>
<i>Lew, really?</i>

26:03.605 --> 26:06.107
I'm here because I owe him.

26:06.149 --> 26:08.777
Oh, so you owe another man?

26:08.818 --> 26:11.404
- I've been inside
a long time, Reed.

26:11.446 --> 26:13.990
I owe a lot of men.

26:14.032 --> 26:17.077
- But those were
your words, Lew.

26:17.118 --> 26:22.248
You were gonna pay me off,
start over out in Peoria.

26:22.290 --> 26:27.796
Now, call me crazy,
but this ain't starting over.

26:32.467 --> 26:35.053
And it don't make a whole lot
of sense, now, does it?

26:35.095 --> 26:39.724
- Like I said, Reed,
I owe this man.

26:39.766 --> 26:42.686
I ain't sitting here
playing with you, either.

26:42.727 --> 26:45.939
<i>So you can either tell me to</i>
<i>walk, or we can just do this--</i>

26:45.980 --> 26:47.816
- You sure you just
one and done, Lew?

26:47.857 --> 26:49.109
- Hey, I don't want
any part of this.

26:49.150 --> 26:50.443
We can do this nice and easy.

26:50.485 --> 26:51.778
I don't know you.

26:51.820 --> 26:54.280
- Was that you
getting to know me?

26:56.991 --> 27:00.120
Do you even really need to?

27:00.161 --> 27:02.664
- You brought cash?
- Yeah, I brought cash.

27:04.416 --> 27:05.500
Where are you selling?

27:05.542 --> 27:07.585
Humboldt Park, homey.

27:07.627 --> 27:10.130
My guys are out.

27:10.171 --> 27:11.756
How much?

27:11.798 --> 27:14.634
- It's two bricks, bro,
to hold me down.

27:14.676 --> 27:21.850
<i>* *</i>

27:24.644 --> 27:26.813
I'll be in touch.

27:26.855 --> 27:28.940
Get the hell out of my place.

28:04.476 --> 28:04.893
.

28:04.934 --> 28:05.852
- All right,
so we cloned your phone.

28:07.145 --> 28:09.939
As soon as Reed reaches out,
we'll set the deal.

28:09.981 --> 28:11.399
We'll be arresting
both you and Torres,

28:11.441 --> 28:12.984
- make it look nice and clean.
- Yeah.

28:13.026 --> 28:15.737
- Yo, I got him.
Y'all good to go.

28:18.573 --> 28:19.616
Mm-hmm.

28:19.657 --> 28:20.575
- We're upstairs
if you need us.

28:20.617 --> 28:22.911
Yes, ma'am.

28:22.952 --> 28:25.914
So what was Reed talking about

28:25.955 --> 28:28.792
when he said that you weren't
really in the game?

28:28.833 --> 28:32.087
He was talking about nothing.

28:32.128 --> 28:34.422
That was a long time ago.
It doesn't matter.

28:34.464 --> 28:37.467
Ah. Well.

28:37.509 --> 28:41.054
You know, I read the report
when I got on the job.

28:43.306 --> 28:46.434
Armed robbery
with a sawed-off, right?

28:46.476 --> 28:49.229
Yeah.

28:49.270 --> 28:52.232
Then I guess we don't need
to talk about anything.

28:55.610 --> 28:57.862
What do you want from me, huh?

28:57.904 --> 28:59.322
You're asking me questions.

28:59.364 --> 29:02.450
Why?
It's not gonna do nothing but--

29:02.492 --> 29:03.910
[phone buzzing]

29:03.952 --> 29:05.495
That's probably Reed.

29:10.458 --> 29:12.961
- Mm-hmm.

29:13.003 --> 29:15.130
The buy is on.

29:17.549 --> 29:19.050
You should get some rest.

Maybe he's security.

Yo, change of plans.

29:57.339 --> 29:59.299
Reed said he was meeting us.

29:59.341 --> 30:01.593
- He wants a show of sign
of trust first, okay?

30:04.179 --> 30:05.930
You and me are taking
the cash to him.

30:05.972 --> 30:08.308
- Get in.
- No.

- So what?

30:32.707 --> 30:35.001
So trust.

30:35.043 --> 30:36.503
- Wait, Sarge,
we can't front the money

30:36.544 --> 30:37.629
and let them go alone.

30:37.671 --> 30:39.005
<i>It's Torres' call.</i>

30:39.047 --> 30:40.882

Look, if he fronts it,
we go mobile.

32:47.884 --> 32:50.095
- They must have made a switch.
- They played us.

32:50.136 --> 32:52.222
They made a switch with a dummy
car in the parking garage.

32:52.263 --> 32:54.140
Don't have eyes,
and they're in the wind.

32:54.182 --> 32:56.476

sweep of the garage.

you got a signal on Lew's COH?

33:13.868 --> 33:15.412
- I--I can't get one.

33:15.453 --> 33:17.163
Either it's been turned off,
or he's out of range.

33:17.205 --> 33:19.165
I'm working on pinging
Lew's phone now.

33:19.207 --> 33:20.458
Okay, driver was waiting.

33:20.500 --> 33:22.502
They made that switch
in a small window.

33:22.544 --> 33:25.005
This could be the standard
heat run for these guys.

33:25.046 --> 33:26.589
- Or they ripped us,
ripped Lew.

33:26.631 --> 33:28.008
He could be dead by now.

33:28.049 --> 33:29.175
All right, so pull cams.

33:29.217 --> 33:30.677
Run every plate
in and out of here.

33:30.719 --> 33:32.387
- All right,
kiosk had a camera.

33:32.429 --> 33:33.638
Got an image of Lew

35:19.327 --> 35:21.371
Don't look at me.

35:21.413 --> 35:23.331
Come on. Move.

35:23.373 --> 35:24.666
Spread 'em.

35:26.835 --> 35:28.753
- Whoa, we got a runner.
- I got him.

35:33.299 --> 35:34.300
Stop moving.

35:34.342 --> 35:35.385
Put your hands
behind your back.

35:35.427 --> 35:38.138
Hands behind your back now.

35:38.179 --> 35:39.848
Get up.

35:39.889 --> 35:45.854

35:45.895 --> 35:48.314
I got dope.

35:48.356 --> 35:49.899
I don't know that kid.

35:49.941 --> 35:51.985
I ain't never seen him
before in my life.

35:52.027 --> 35:53.862
- Put your hands back on the
hood where I can see them.

35:55.405 --> 35:57.032
[chuckles]

35:57.073 --> 35:58.158
Ain't got nothing
to do with me.

35:58.199 --> 36:00.493
Shut up. Bend over.

36:00.535 --> 36:02.370
I'm just here
to see an old friend.

36:12.213 --> 36:14.466
These things happen.

36:14.507 --> 36:17.260
We lost the signal,
and we had to make a call.

36:17.302 --> 36:19.512
All you had to do was wait.

36:19.554 --> 36:20.930
What the hell were
you guys thinking?

36:20.972 --> 36:22.849
- We was thinking that
you was getting jacked.

36:22.891 --> 36:24.351
Aww.

36:24.392 --> 36:26.436
You shouldn't have.

36:26.478 --> 36:29.439
I handled myself just fine
for the last 20 years.

36:29.481 --> 36:31.232
Bet you did.

36:33.026 --> 36:33.943
I bet.

36:37.822 --> 36:38.907
So what now?

36:40.575 --> 36:41.868
What's all that mean?

36:41.910 --> 36:43.286
- All that means
is that we couldn't

36:43.328 --> 36:44.454
catch him with the dope.

36:44.496 --> 36:47.749
There was no transaction,
so we wait.

36:47.791 --> 36:49.584
And the kid lawyered up quick
'cause he's scared

36:49.626 --> 36:51.461
of getting two holes
in the back of his head.

36:53.630 --> 36:55.382
All we got on Reed
is an unregistered firearm.

36:55.423 --> 36:56.633
That's what that means.

36:58.593 --> 37:00.804
- He'll do less than a year
on that, if that.

37:00.845 --> 37:01.930
I know.

37:04.766 --> 37:06.768
So where does that leave me?

37:10.980 --> 37:11.940
Well...

37:13.817 --> 37:17.028
Far as Reed's concerned,
we were following him.

37:17.070 --> 37:19.948
We arrested you with his guy,
so you should look clean.

37:22.200 --> 37:24.411
I mean, you can go.

37:27.872 --> 37:28.998
Good.

37:32.919 --> 37:34.462
That's a damn shame.

37:36.006 --> 37:37.465
'Cause I was hoping we could
at least have some kind

37:37.507 --> 37:38.633
of conversation first.

37:41.845 --> 37:46.099

37:46.141 --> 37:49.769
I tried for a long-ass time
not to care about this.

37:55.608 --> 37:57.360
I think I'm gonna need
some kind of understanding.

37:57.402 --> 37:58.361
- There's nothing
to understand.

37:58.403 --> 37:59.571
Sure, there is.

37:59.612 --> 38:01.072
There's always something
to understand.

38:06.995 --> 38:10.123
No.

38:10.165 --> 38:13.043
I wasn't a good person.

38:13.084 --> 38:15.295
I'm still not all good.

38:15.337 --> 38:16.755
If you want me to say
that I was...

38:16.796 --> 38:18.757
By myself, I raised them.

38:22.802 --> 38:24.429
So I don't understand
why you feel like

38:24.471 --> 38:28.975
you owe everybody else but me.

38:29.017 --> 38:31.227
- I don't know what
you want from me.

38:31.269 --> 38:32.437
I want the truth.

38:32.479 --> 38:33.563
The truth?

38:33.605 --> 38:35.065
Yes, the truth.

38:35.106 --> 38:37.400
If you got the truth in you,
that's what I need.

38:37.442 --> 38:38.735
The truth.

38:41.363 --> 38:43.031
The truth is...

38:45.283 --> 38:47.494
We weren't doing good.

38:47.535 --> 38:49.120
We never were.

38:51.831 --> 38:54.334
We needed money,

38:54.376 --> 38:56.878
and I found
the wrong way to get it.

38:59.673 --> 39:03.343
You know, I was just a lookout.

39:03.385 --> 39:07.055
But when the police came,
I took it.

39:07.097 --> 39:08.431
I took the rap.

39:10.767 --> 39:14.187
I didn't talk,
didn't give names,

39:14.229 --> 39:16.523
so I went to prison.

39:23.571 --> 39:25.782
Yeah, so what about us?

39:25.824 --> 39:27.075
Us?

39:31.246 --> 39:33.665
You can't just go
to prison and then not expect

39:33.707 --> 39:36.543
for me to wanna see you,
for me to be on the damn list.

39:36.584 --> 39:38.503
You couldn't put me
on the list?

39:42.632 --> 39:45.927
Explain that.

39:45.969 --> 39:49.597
- No one wants their kid
to see him like that.

39:49.639 --> 39:51.182
I didn't want you to.

39:51.224 --> 39:57.188
I wanted you to remember me
different, good.

I wanted you to remember
those midnight walks.

Good as anywhere.

You know, I own a building.

40:54.871 --> 40:57.665
I got an empty unit
you can stay.

41:02.212 --> 41:03.505
I don't deserve that.

41:05.882 --> 41:09.302
You're damn right you don't.
