00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
The following programme contains
strong language and violent scenes.

00:15.000 --> 00:16.960
This is mad.

00:16.960 --> 00:19.360
These animals
took everything from us.

00:19.360 --> 00:21.040
So you gonna kill them
off one by one?

00:21.040 --> 00:22.960
Not gonna mess it up again.

00:22.960 --> 00:25.440
I can't watch you do this...

00:25.440 --> 00:27.720
Dropped off the face of the earth
after she got released.

00:27.720 --> 00:29.760
That woman is Mercy Winters.

00:29.760 --> 00:31.800
The Lords
are planning to settle here.

00:31.800 --> 00:33.680
So you might see me around, kid.

00:33.680 --> 00:36.920
Tomorrow morning
there'll be a boatload of puff
landing on our beach.

00:36.920 --> 00:39.200
Used these trucks before?
Many times.

00:39.200 --> 00:41.280
Gavvs will be on you
if you keep doing the same route.

00:41.280 --> 00:42.360
Sticking to the plan.

00:42.360 --> 00:44.760
You've come along way son
for someone who's just started.

00:44.760 --> 00:47.320
You arrogant-
You wanna see dangerous?

00:47.320 --> 00:48.560
You'll see...

00:48.560 --> 00:50.600
Stay schtum
and let me do the talking.

00:50.600 --> 00:52.160
No, don't try and side door me.

00:52.160 --> 00:54.400
Kelly, shush.

00:54.400 --> 00:56.560
Who do you think you are,
Ronnie Biggs?

00:57.600 --> 00:58.840
Speak from the heart.

00:58.840 --> 01:00.000
"Kell, pick up."

01:00.000 --> 01:02.360
You're nice, Kelly...

01:02.360 --> 01:04.000
But it's your brother I like.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.800
Are you serious?

01:06.880 --> 01:09.200
"Kelly, this is urgent.
Is the coast clear?"

01:09.200 --> 01:10.680
'They won't see me coming.'

01:12.680 --> 01:14.840
'One by one they'll all go.'

01:14.840 --> 01:17.120
It's the cops.

01:17.120 --> 01:19.600

03:36.920 --> 03:38.600
I wanna see my son.

03:38.600 --> 03:41.040
Go home, Miss Carter. Cool off.

03:41.040 --> 03:42.520
He's still a minor!

03:42.520 --> 03:44.760
You got no right
keeping him banged up!

03:44.760 --> 03:46.560
Oh.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.560
I am aware of the law.

03:48.560 --> 03:51.440
The problem is
your son doesn't wanna see you.

03:53.080 --> 03:54.640
He said that?

03:54.640 --> 03:56.800
He used
slightly more colourful language.

03:56.800 --> 04:00.000
Like what?"I never want
to see my fucking mum again."

04:00.000 --> 04:02.320
What? You can't just keep him here.

04:02.320 --> 04:05.400
He's being kept in a holding cell,
until we're ready to charge him.

04:05.400 --> 04:07.160
Ch- Charge him w- with what?

04:07.160 --> 04:08.880
Trafficking. Intent to supply...

04:08.880 --> 04:11.000
He's just a fucking kid!

04:13.160 --> 04:15.120
What?
Don't worry.

I'll have his belongings
packed up and returned to you,

I thought I'd lost you.

06:05.480 --> 06:07.240
Nah.

06:07.240 --> 06:09.600
You won't get shot of me
that easily.

06:12.240 --> 06:14.240
What happened?

06:17.240 --> 06:19.240
Don't remember.

06:23.200 --> 06:25.440
It's just a blur.

06:27.600 --> 06:30.800
Well, looks like you made
a good impression at the gala...

06:31.960 --> 06:34.240

Did he?

06:42.000 --> 06:46.120
is the only thing
that might save us from death."

06:50.040 --> 06:51.800
What does that mean?

06:53.440 --> 06:55.360
No idea.

06:59.840 --> 07:01.280
Well...

07:02.280 --> 07:04.320
Thank God you're OK.

07:07.040 --> 07:10.920
You know I'd die if I lost you too.

07:21.120 --> 07:23.640
Look what he's done
to my fucking motor.

07:23.640 --> 07:25.280
Come on.

07:31.920 --> 07:33.880
Fuck is wrong with you, mush?

07:33.880 --> 07:35.600
Liven yourself up.

07:35.600 --> 07:38.560
You're about as useful
as a fork in a bowl of soup.

07:38.560 --> 07:39.960
Ma?

07:40.800 --> 07:42.360

07:53.280 --> 07:56.880
Boy! What have they done to you?
Carl, fetch the first aid.

07:56.880 --> 07:58.520
Do it now, girl!
You alright, son?

07:58.520 --> 08:00.600
- Oh my God.
- I'm sorry,
I should've listened to you.

08:00.600 --> 08:02.240
We're here,
we'll look after you now...

08:02.240 --> 08:03.760
Listen, no, listen.

08:03.760 --> 08:06.000
They've given us until sunset tomorrow...

08:06.000 --> 08:08.840
Otherwise-Let's just get
on a plane and go home, hey?

08:08.840 --> 08:11.600
No. We're Lords. We stay and fight.
They're gonna kill us, Dad!

08:11.600 --> 08:13.520
The Moroccans
are gonna come back and kill us!

08:13.520 --> 08:16.440
Let's just go back to South London-
Will you please calm down, cunt?

08:16.440 --> 08:18.920
You're not the one lying
on the floor covered in blood!

08:18.920 --> 08:21.280
Where were you Kelly? Hey?!

08:21.280 --> 08:24.560
You should've been on lookout.
The r- The radios were shit.

08:24.560 --> 08:26.160
What?
Fuck the radios!

08:26.160 --> 08:28.520
If we don't get the drugs back,
we'll all be killed!

08:28.520 --> 08:30.360
Don't worry, darling. Ma's here now.

08:30.360 --> 08:32.240
I'll clean him up...

08:49.880 --> 08:52.760
Come on...

08:52.760 --> 08:56.040
I'm gonna get Eddie back
if it's the last thing I ever do.

08:57.400 --> 08:59.640
Fuck!

08:59.640 --> 09:01.160
How?

09:04.320 --> 09:07.640
Why was he even on that
truck in the first place?

09:09.760 --> 09:11.600
It's not your fault, Gene.

09:11.600 --> 09:13.480
It was on my watch.

09:29.440 --> 09:31.760
Alfonso offered me a deal.

09:35.720 --> 09:38.760
If I tell them
what happened at Escobells...

09:38.760 --> 09:41.800
how Ernesto died,
they'll let Eddie go without charge.

09:41.800 --> 09:43.480
Cindy no!
What else am I gonna do?

09:43.480 --> 09:45.080
Is that what you want?

09:45.080 --> 09:47.360
Go to prison
and never see each other again?

09:47.360 --> 09:49.160
What other options do I have?

09:49.160 --> 09:52.440
My child is about to get taken away
to some remand centre in Madrid...

09:54.520 --> 09:57.000
Fuck! Listen. You listen.

09:57.000 --> 10:00.440
You are not gonna hand yourself in.

10:00.440 --> 10:02.960
OK? I'll find a way
of getting Eddie out of there.

10:02.960 --> 10:05.000
We're a family,
and I'm not gonna let you suffer.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.400
Do you hear me?
I won't let you suffer!

10:08.400 --> 10:10.200
OK?

10:15.080 --> 10:17.240
Fuck.

10:55.280 --> 10:58.920
This is your last chance
to make a statement, young man.

10:58.920 --> 11:01.400
Oh! Er, sorry, boss...

11:01.400 --> 11:04.040
Could you make sure
and put theft of a police vehicle

11:04.040 --> 11:06.120
on his rap sheet please? Thank you.

11:06.120 --> 11:08.120
Sorry.

11:08.120 --> 11:10.480
This is DI Lindsey
from the Metropolitan Police.

11:10.480 --> 11:11.960
She's merely an observer...

11:12.800 --> 11:14.160
Well...

11:14.160 --> 11:16.400
She can fuck off then.

11:17.240 --> 11:21.120
So-You see,
what I don't understand, Eddie...

11:21.120 --> 11:24.320
is why your mum came
to be in Spain in the first place.

11:24.320 --> 11:27.280
I mean if you were my son,
beautiful as you are,

11:27.280 --> 11:29.960
I would be counting down the
days down until your release.

11:29.960 --> 11:32.040
Not pissing off
to the Costa del Sol

11:32.040 --> 11:34.480
as soon as I got my cunt
in the till, but you know...

11:34.480 --> 11:36.840
It weren't like that.
Whatever you say.

11:37.680 --> 11:39.320
Where's your old man?

11:39.320 --> 11:41.600
In the ground.
How?

11:42.440 --> 11:44.800
Busy cow, ain't she?
Just answer the question.

11:45.640 --> 11:47.040
Died in a fire.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.480
What has it got to do with this
anyway?

11:52.160 --> 11:53.880
Why are you writing that down?

11:55.120 --> 11:57.440
Think that's gonna
help with your case?

11:58.240 --> 12:01.400
You gotta be up early
to catch my Mum out...

12:01.400 --> 12:03.600
And see, I know what extradition is.

12:03.600 --> 12:06.040
And whatever my mum did
to that gavver back in London,

12:06.040 --> 12:08.320
doesn't mean anything out here.

12:09.120 --> 12:11.960
You can't touch her
as long as she's in Spain.

12:13.640 --> 12:15.680
Ain't that right mate?

12:20.080 --> 12:22.200
Well...

12:25.040 --> 12:27.480
Muchas gracias, Edward.

12:28.320 --> 12:30.800
You have been most helpful...

12:31.640 --> 12:34.600
...in completely fucking your Mum.

12:52.960 --> 12:54.720
This her, then?
Eddie!

12:56.440 --> 12:58.280
Eddie, it's me, remember?

12:59.120 --> 13:01.200
No touching.

13:01.200 --> 13:03.480
Need to speak to Alfonso.

13:03.480 --> 13:05.640

Said she had to meet someone.

But you have to help me.

14:07.960 --> 14:10.160
Of course. Come here, boy.

16:00.840 --> 16:02.320
Fuck you.

16:09.400 --> 16:12.160
You've so much more to offer
than brute force.

16:14.720 --> 16:17.000
I don't see violence in you.

16:18.680 --> 16:20.480
I just see...

16:22.080 --> 16:24.200
...a vulnerable soul.

Kell?

16:52.280 --> 16:55.880
Lola asking if we've seen Manuela
knocking about.

16:55.880 --> 16:58.720
Says she hasn't been seen
since yesterday.

17:00.720 --> 17:02.600
Er, nah...

17:02.600 --> 17:05.080
Nah, sorry. Can't help you.

17:05.920 --> 17:08.040
She liked you, Kell.
What you on about, Carl?

17:08.880 --> 17:12.040
I saw you,
chatting away at the party.

17:14.600 --> 17:17.080
Did she say anything to you?

17:18.600 --> 17:20.960
Erm...

17:20.960 --> 17:23.560
Nah. No, she, er...

17:24.880 --> 17:29.360
She said something about
mates in Marbella, or something.

17:30.240 --> 17:32.520
Dunno. She might've gone there.

17:33.920 --> 17:36.080
Anyway, I'm... heading off...

17:36.080 --> 17:37.760
Hold tight, girl.

17:39.880 --> 17:41.480
Kell...

17:42.560 --> 17:44.560
What's going on?

17:47.240 --> 17:49.600
If you've fucking knocked her up,

17:49.600 --> 17:51.840
I swear I'll-
She's not coming home, Ma.

17:57.800 --> 17:59.840
I lied.

18:00.680 --> 18:02.960
We were at Escobells.

18:03.920 --> 18:05.520
Don't mind me.

18:09.800 --> 18:11.640
I'm merely an observer.

18:13.320 --> 18:15.240
Have we met before?

18:15.240 --> 18:17.680
I'm a long way from home, me, kiddo.

18:19.120 --> 18:22.720
What the fuck's she doing here?
Back to Escobells, Miss Carter.

18:31.840 --> 18:34.200
Tony went there on business.

18:34.200 --> 18:36.240
Ernesto had other ideas.

18:36.240 --> 18:38.040
Such as?

18:38.040 --> 18:40.120
They fell out.

18:40.120 --> 18:42.600
Ernesto had a score to settle.

18:42.600 --> 18:44.640
Tony never stood a chance.

18:48.480 --> 18:51.520
Ernesto put a bullet in his head.
We legged it.

18:51.520 --> 18:54.680
And then you decided
to take the law into your own hands?

18:54.680 --> 18:56.960
No, no. Ernesto was still alive
when we left.

18:56.960 --> 18:58.440
I'm not talking about Escobells.

18:58.440 --> 19:01.400
I'm talking about the hospital
where Ernesto was recovering.

19:02.360 --> 19:03.760
Come on!

19:03.760 --> 19:06.000
Do you really wanna see
your son walk out of here?

19:06.000 --> 19:08.440
If you value him that much,
tell me the truth.

19:12.080 --> 19:14.160
Gene loved his uncle.

19:14.160 --> 19:16.240
I couldn't just let it lie.

19:16.240 --> 19:18.280
So, he put you up to it?

19:20.680 --> 19:22.440
Not good enough.

19:22.440 --> 19:26.680
If you want your son to walk
out of here, I want both of you.

19:38.520 --> 19:40.560
I acted alone.

19:41.520 --> 19:43.160
Yeah.

19:43.160 --> 19:45.440
Gene's a good man.

19:46.960 --> 19:49.080
He'd never hurt anyone.

Showtime.

Get the bag.

Dad...

21:25.560 --> 21:27.840
We're just gonna talk to 'em, yeah?

Que pasa? Que pasa?!

21:50.320 --> 21:51.920
Pipe down.

21:51.920 --> 21:54.200
Do as I say and no one gets hurt.

21:54.200 --> 21:57.120
Shut it, woman! Or I'll give you
something to fucking scream about!

22:00.000 --> 22:01.720
That's exactly what you're gonna do.

22:01.720 --> 22:03.760
Call Alfonso,
tell him you're with the Lords.

22:03.760 --> 22:05.960
We want Eddie and Cindy Carter
released. Comprende?

22:05.960 --> 22:08.680
No! I won't do it! No!
Do you fucking hear what I'm saying!

22:08.680 --> 22:10.400
No!
I said call your son!

22:10.400 --> 22:12.440
Bloody animal.

22:12.440 --> 22:13.880
You make the call.

22:13.880 --> 22:16.280
Or I'll iron your old man out!

22:16.280 --> 22:19.080
Don't do it, my love. Don't do it!

22:19.080 --> 22:20.560
Chuck us the bag, son!

22:20.560 --> 22:22.200
Wake up! Chuck us the bag!

22:26.360 --> 22:28.480
You don't wanna talk...

22:28.480 --> 22:30.640
You'll fucking burn instead!
Dad!

22:30.640 --> 22:33.240
You said you wanted my help.
Just make the fucking call!

22:33.240 --> 22:36.240
No please, don't do it!
No!

22:36.240 --> 22:38.400
Please don't do it.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
What happens now?

22:43.000 --> 22:46.720
Your case will be referred
to the Juzgados de Instruccion.

22:46.720 --> 22:48.960
But I...
I wouldn't make any firm plans

22:48.960 --> 22:51.760
for what? The next 15 years or so?

22:52.840 --> 22:55.160
When will you release Eddie?

22:58.440 --> 23:01.600
Sorry. I have to receive a call.

23:02.440 --> 23:05.600
Don't go anywhere.
Oh, I forgot! You can't.

23:32.640 --> 23:35.360
Gave up three years ago, but...

23:35.360 --> 23:38.320
Ah, fuck it. We're all gonna die
one day, aren't we?

23:39.160 --> 23:42.560
Yeah... Some sooner than others.

23:42.560 --> 23:44.120
I want Eddie and Cindy released.

23:44.120 --> 23:45.880
And I want my trucks
back on the road.

23:45.880 --> 23:48.280
I don't respond to blackmail,
Mr Lord.

23:48.280 --> 23:50.160
"Well, you didn't leave me
with much choice."

23:50.160 --> 23:52.440
Listen to me, you dago bastard.

23:52.440 --> 23:54.080
You release those trucks

23:54.080 --> 23:56.600
Or the next time you see your
family, they'll be in the morgue.

23:56.600 --> 23:58.440
In this country, we respect the law.

23:58.440 --> 24:00.720
I wanna be honest with you, Cindy.

24:01.560 --> 24:03.960
I don't really give a shit
about Escobells,

24:03.960 --> 24:06.000
or Ernesto Alvarez for that matter.

24:06.000 --> 24:10.840
What I'm interested in, is how you
ended up engaged to Gene Lord.

24:10.840 --> 24:14.360
I mean it's quite a spectacular
fall from grace, isn't it?

24:14.360 --> 24:16.680
Even for someone
who's already in the gutter.

24:18.160 --> 24:20.840
I guess you can't choose
who you fall in love with.

24:20.840 --> 24:23.960
Do you hear that?

24:23.960 --> 24:26.320
That's the sound of your old man
about to go up in smoke.

24:26.320 --> 24:29.160
It's your mess son,
you clean it up.

24:29.160 --> 24:32.120
How come, just as you
get your feet under the table,

24:32.120 --> 24:34.600
you do a runner to Spain?
Why's that?

24:35.440 --> 24:38.320
Just fancied a bit of sun.
Suits you.

24:38.320 --> 24:40.160
Last chance!

24:42.320 --> 24:43.600
"Light him up."

24:43.600 --> 24:45.840
Dad, please.
Light him up.

24:45.840 --> 24:47.320
Let's go back to the day

24:47.320 --> 24:49.880
you two love birds
left for the airport, shall we?

24:54.480 --> 24:56.280
Dad, I can't...

24:56.280 --> 24:59.240
Don't say you can't.
You ain't got a choice son.

25:03.840 --> 25:05.560
PC David Russo.

25:05.560 --> 25:07.160
Killed in the line of duty.

25:07.160 --> 25:09.120
Leaves behind a wife and two kids.

25:09.120 --> 25:12.680
That lad was my partner.

25:13.520 --> 25:15.560
Never seen him before.

25:15.560 --> 25:18.600
You wanna Eddie out of jail,
it's time to grow a pair, boy.

25:20.160 --> 25:22.320
"Fucking burn 'em!"

25:23.160 --> 25:24.840
Really?

25:28.480 --> 25:30.400
That's not what your Eddie says.

25:32.200 --> 25:34.240
Go on son, do it.

25:43.960 --> 25:46.600
Go on! Fucking do it!

25:46.600 --> 25:47.960
I'm sorry.

25:47.960 --> 25:49.560
NO! Stop!

25:51.480 --> 25:54.720
I'll do it. I'll do it.
"Good boy."

25:55.600 --> 25:58.800
Right.
You go and get Cindy and the boy.

25:59.640 --> 26:01.880
I'll take care of the trucks.

26:14.200 --> 26:16.000
Size of you.

26:16.000 --> 26:19.240
She never stood a chance,
the poor young thing.

26:21.120 --> 26:23.800
I never meant to hurt her, Ma.

26:29.520 --> 26:31.840
Get a fucking grip of yourself!

26:31.840 --> 26:34.760
Don't just stand there,
full of self-pity.

26:34.760 --> 26:38.360
It's her I feel sorry for.
Not you, you big fucking clot!

26:39.480 --> 26:41.720
Now, you're gonna help me

26:41.720 --> 26:46.040
drag that poor young soul
out of here.

26:46.040 --> 26:48.000
And Kelly...

26:48.000 --> 26:50.760
We NEVER speak of this again.

26:51.640 --> 26:53.920
Right? Never.

26:54.760 --> 26:56.320
We die with this.

26:56.320 --> 26:58.840
This EVER comes to light,

26:58.840 --> 27:01.840
our family will be ruined.

27:02.640 --> 27:04.960
We will ALL go down with you!

27:04.960 --> 27:06.960
All of us.

27:06.960 --> 27:09.000
You hear me, boy?

27:09.960 --> 27:12.800
God damn it!

27:35.320 --> 27:37.400
Eternal rest

27:37.400 --> 27:39.920
grant unto them, O Lord.

27:40.720 --> 27:43.240
And let perpetual light
shine upon them.

27:44.040 --> 27:48.400
May their souls and the souls
of all the faithful departed,

27:48.400 --> 27:50.720
through the mercy of God,

27:50.720 --> 27:52.760
rest in peace.

27:55.880 --> 27:57.800
Fucking him were you?

27:57.800 --> 28:00.120
Your partner...

28:00.120 --> 28:01.880
Eww.

28:01.880 --> 28:04.840
Dread to think what that looks like.

28:05.840 --> 28:08.120
He had a lucky escape.

28:10.600 --> 28:12.880
I heard about the fire...

28:12.880 --> 28:14.600
Yeah, Eddie told me.

28:15.400 --> 28:17.360
It's a terrible thing, that.

28:17.360 --> 28:20.200
What was his name again? Clarence?

28:22.360 --> 28:25.840
The lengths some people will go to
to get away from you.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.520
Miss Carter, you're free to leave.

28:30.520 --> 28:33.080
What?

28:33.080 --> 28:35.800
I've authorised your son's release
as well. Come on, out!

28:35.800 --> 28:37.480
What is going on?

28:37.480 --> 28:39.960
It would appear
love knows no bounds.

28:50.640 --> 28:53.720
See ya, treacle.

29:08.120 --> 29:10.200
Why did you let me sleep?

29:11.680 --> 29:13.920
Because I wanted to watch you.

29:16.360 --> 29:19.160
Well, that's a bit creepy.

29:22.680 --> 29:24.680
Can I see you again?

29:27.120 --> 29:29.320
That's not for me to decide.

29:45.440 --> 29:46.760
Eddie!

29:47.920 --> 29:49.520
Eddie.

30:02.480 --> 30:04.600
What did you do?

30:04.600 --> 30:07.040
I told you, whatever it takes.

30:10.600 --> 30:13.440
Things you do for love, eh?

30:15.560 --> 30:17.640
Welcome home, mate.

30:18.640 --> 30:20.440
Thank you.

30:26.680 --> 30:29.520
And thank you for being there
- for me.

31:38.880 --> 31:41.400
He's young, he'll learn.

31:41.400 --> 31:43.520
I want you two to shake hands.

31:45.320 --> 31:46.840
Well, go on then.

31:54.760 --> 31:56.840
I apologise for what happened.

31:56.840 --> 31:59.320
But I had to incentivise you...

31:59.320 --> 32:02.520
I'm not been funny mate,
it fuckin' worked.

32:02.520 --> 32:04.760
He came of age today.

32:07.600 --> 32:09.680
Now, where were we?

32:09.680 --> 32:12.120
We accept your proposal.

32:12.120 --> 32:14.280
Drop Gene out and deal
directly with me.

32:14.280 --> 32:17.000
I'm your man, alright?
So, a toast...

32:19.320 --> 32:22.040

32:22.840 --> 32:25.080

32:30.880 --> 32:32.280

32:33.480 --> 32:36.160

Good boy.

32:36.160 --> 32:37.960
Cheers.

33:01.040 --> 33:03.040
What's going on in there?

33:03.840 --> 33:07.080
Your dad's giving it
the large with some Moroccan fella.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.160
When did you get discharged?

33:10.160 --> 33:13.280
I could've picked you up.
I wanted to surprise you.

33:16.160 --> 33:18.160
Look at you...

33:23.800 --> 33:25.680
What's that, babe?

33:34.200 --> 33:37.080
I had so many dreams for him, Carl.

33:39.080 --> 33:41.520
Trading in the city.

33:43.200 --> 33:45.240
Playing up front for the Wall...

33:46.080 --> 33:48.080
He loved you...

33:48.080 --> 33:49.960
so much, Len.

33:49.960 --> 33:52.600
And where was I when he needed me?

33:53.680 --> 33:56.960
I let my fucking parents bring him
up and turn him into a little...

33:59.880 --> 34:02.400
And all I did was watch him drown.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.880
I feel like I'm drowning now.

34:10.840 --> 34:13.200
I am so sorry.

34:38.080 --> 34:41.600
Thank you... for what you did.

34:43.800 --> 34:46.520
It's nothing.
I'd do it again if I had to.

34:51.480 --> 34:54.480
When I asked you to marry me, Cind,
I meant it.

34:54.480 --> 34:56.560
Yeah? Through thick and thin.

34:56.560 --> 34:58.960
Until death do us part, as they say.

35:01.760 --> 35:05.480
Yeah, maybe I would've liked to
have known you had a son.

35:06.520 --> 35:09.080
But fuck it, that boy's beautiful.

35:09.080 --> 35:12.880
He's got more soul
than my whole family put together

35:14.000 --> 35:16.960
I know that ain't saying much,
but I mean it.

35:18.920 --> 35:20.560
Fuck!

35:24.520 --> 35:26.920
Just being honest, Cind...

35:26.920 --> 35:29.400
Fucking hell, Gene...

35:33.760 --> 35:35.840
You...

35:37.840 --> 35:40.320
Why the hell did you do this?

35:42.120 --> 35:45.720
Just gone and messed up everything.

35:46.520 --> 35:49.640
I wasn't supposed to feel like this,
I wasn't...

35:54.600 --> 35:56.920
After Eddie's Dad...

36:01.560 --> 36:04.040
...I was scared
to fall in love again.

36:09.560 --> 36:12.400
But there's nothing
I can do about it now...

36:19.360 --> 36:21.360
I can't help it...

36:22.960 --> 36:24.960
I love you.

36:27.200 --> 36:29.520
And I love you.

36:31.520 --> 36:34.080
I love you.

36:52.720 --> 36:54.320
Oi, soft lad!

36:57.280 --> 36:59.200
What the FUCK are you playing at?

37:00.000 --> 37:01.880
You had that stupid bitch
over a barrel,

37:01.880 --> 37:04.800
and you let her stroll out of here!
Are you on their fucking payroll?

37:04.800 --> 37:06.320
Don't you fucking...

37:07.440 --> 37:10.440
I've been in hospital
with my parents

37:10.440 --> 37:13.560
while they recover from the trauma
of nearly getting killed!

37:13.560 --> 37:15.680
Shit...

37:15.680 --> 37:17.720
What happened?

37:20.240 --> 37:22.280
You think you know these people?

37:22.280 --> 37:24.640
They tied my parents up,
doused them in petrol,

37:24.640 --> 37:26.680
and threatened
to burn them to ashes.

37:26.680 --> 37:28.840
These people are fucking animals.

37:29.720 --> 37:33.080
So, do yourself a favour and get the
hell out of Alabasas while you can.

37:33.080 --> 37:34.400
So that's it?

37:34.400 --> 37:36.480
You give up
and they get off scot-free?

37:44.040 --> 37:46.080
Fuck that.

37:57.520 --> 37:59.680
Len, what's this all about?

37:59.680 --> 38:01.320
Fuck knows.

38:03.960 --> 38:06.240
Kelly! Get in here!

38:06.240 --> 38:08.800
Leave him be, Alb.
KELLY!

38:13.520 --> 38:15.800
What have I done now?

38:15.800 --> 38:18.120
Well, you look like death.

38:18.120 --> 38:20.080
Oh, thanks.

38:20.080 --> 38:22.920
You gonna tell us
what's going on, or what?

38:22.920 --> 38:26.400
The Gitanos have got a lead
on that missing girl.

38:26.400 --> 38:28.520
They're organising a search
party in the woods.

38:28.520 --> 38:31.600
That girl's not our problem, Alb.

38:31.600 --> 38:33.560
No. But the Gitanos are.

38:33.560 --> 38:35.680
And if we wanna build anything
on that land,

38:35.680 --> 38:36.960
we gotta keep them sweet.

38:36.960 --> 38:40.520
Our hotel's just a pile of rubble
'til they find that gypsy girl.

38:40.520 --> 38:43.000
We're so close. Wow.

38:43.000 --> 38:44.960
What a kind hearted man you are.

38:44.960 --> 38:47.160
I don't give a fuck.
We're gonna be there.

38:47.160 --> 38:51.000
Front and centre. Blood, sweat,
fucking tears. Whole performance.

38:51.000 --> 38:54.000
And that's all of you...
You understand?

38:54.000 --> 38:55.800
And stick some decent clobber on.

38:55.800 --> 38:58.480
We need to make it
look like we really give a fuck.

I stowed away on the truck?
