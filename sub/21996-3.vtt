They just followed you.
They kept staring at you.

00:05.873 --> 00:07.406
This is a spirit
that is angry.

00:07.508 --> 00:08.674
He said he was
going to kill her.

00:08.776 --> 00:11.043
Listen to that!
Who's up there?

00:11.145 --> 00:13.312

is crazy.

-Whoa! What was that?

00:53.687 --> 00:56.422
I can't give you
an explanation.

01:14.542 --> 01:17.876
ZAK: We're doing a city-wide
investigation of Vicksburg.

01:17.978 --> 01:22.281
This segment, I'm going
to entitle "Abandoned."

01:23.584 --> 01:27.019
We will investigate
two neglected structures

01:27.121 --> 01:32.257
both ringing with dark echoes
of the 1863 Siege of Vicksburg,

01:32.359 --> 01:34.460
a calamitous battle
for control

01:34.562 --> 01:38.664
of a city considered crucial
to winning the Civil War.

01:38.766 --> 01:41.700
We'll explore the Kuhn Memorial
State Hospital,

01:41.802 --> 01:44.303
which was built in 1832

01:44.405 --> 01:48.006
to address a rampaging outbreak
of smallpox

01:48.108 --> 01:49.775
and received wave after wave

01:49.877 --> 01:54.179
of wounded, broken, and dying
Civil War soldiers.

01:55.816 --> 01:58.951
Now it's host to something
extremely hostile.

01:59.053 --> 02:01.787
There's definitely something in
here that's really aggressive.

02:01.889 --> 02:04.490
One spirit said he was
going to kill her.

02:04.592 --> 02:07.192
ZAK: But first we focus
on a structure built

02:07.294 --> 02:10.662
as a private home on land
that had been reduced to rubble

02:10.764 --> 02:14.700
by the lethal bombardment
of the Siege.

02:14.802 --> 02:16.568
It was later used as a lodge

02:16.670 --> 02:19.238
by the Benevolent Order
of the Elks,

02:19.340 --> 02:23.075
but this property
is still plagued by tragedy.

02:23.177 --> 02:25.444
There was an unsolved
brutal murder here.

02:25.546 --> 02:28.213
-There was a what?
-A murder. Cold-blooded murder.

02:28.315 --> 02:31.283
The summer of 2005,

02:31.385 --> 02:33.652
there was a birthday party here,
a happy time.

02:33.754 --> 02:35.621
They were celebrating,
and somebody

02:35.723 --> 02:38.457
just walks up
behind him and pow.

02:38.559 --> 02:41.827
The murder was never solved.

02:41.929 --> 02:43.662
This is not
a spirit at rest.

02:43.764 --> 02:46.598
This is a spirit that is angry,
it is unsettled,

02:46.700 --> 02:48.333
just looking
for some justification.

02:48.435 --> 02:50.002
"Why am I here?
What's going on?"

02:50.104 --> 02:51.803
Exactly. You know,
"What is this?"
You know, "What has happened?"

02:51.906 --> 02:55.040
"I was at a birthday party,
and now I'm seeing this."
Yeah. Right.

02:55.142 --> 02:56.475
"Well, why can't I feel this?
Why can't I touch this?"

02:56.577 --> 02:57.876
Right. Yeah.

02:57.978 --> 02:59.845
"Why can't people hear
my voice?"
Right.

02:59.947 --> 03:01.146
We're here to hear his voice.

03:01.248 --> 03:03.782
¶¶

03:05.252 --> 03:08.387
The house that stood here before
was destroyed in the Siege.

03:08.489 --> 03:11.189
It was wiped out during
the bombardment of the city.

03:11.292 --> 03:13.091
We know that yellow fever
his the city...

03:13.193 --> 03:14.493
Okay.
...in the 1700s.

03:14.595 --> 03:17.095
There are unmarked graves
around this city.

03:17.197 --> 03:20.299
This is a place
full of restless spirits.
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

03:20.401 --> 03:21.633
¶¶

03:21.735 --> 03:23.101
So we know the ingredients
are there

03:23.203 --> 03:24.703
for something
much more darker.

03:24.805 --> 03:27.105
Anything in Vicksburg
is going to have that.
Sure.

03:27.207 --> 03:30.075
But really sparks my interest
is a murder that is so...

03:30.177 --> 03:31.577
Recent.
...recent.

03:32.613 --> 03:36.248
What happens when a person
crosses over in the house

03:36.350 --> 03:38.550
that has already been
stained and marked

03:38.652 --> 03:41.453
by such war...
Right.

03:41.555 --> 03:42.588
...and other atrocities?
Yes.

03:42.690 --> 03:45.023
What does that spirit
enter into?

03:45.125 --> 03:46.959
¶¶

03:47.061 --> 03:49.461
ZAK: Earlier, I asked
the owner of the building,

03:49.563 --> 03:53.465
who wants to repair and sell it,
what is holding him back.

03:53.567 --> 03:54.900
A lot of weird things
are going on.

03:55.002 --> 03:56.935
Like, I fixed the steeple
on the other side,

03:57.037 --> 03:59.237
come back the next day,
everything was

03:59.340 --> 04:02.107
back like it was
before I came.

04:02.209 --> 04:03.609
Leave my tools here,
come back, they're gone.

04:03.711 --> 04:06.378
And I'm the only one that got
a key to the building.

04:06.480 --> 04:09.014
So your tools will
just go missing?

04:09.116 --> 04:10.415
Just disappear.

04:10.517 --> 04:13.051
Your repairs get fixed and then
it's just broken again.

04:13.153 --> 04:14.319
Right.

04:14.421 --> 04:16.888
So something is not wanting you
to fix the building.

04:16.991 --> 04:18.256
Right.

04:18.359 --> 04:21.793
One of my guys that worked
for me had something come up

04:21.895 --> 04:23.028
and touch him
on his shoulder.

04:23.130 --> 04:24.796
Okay, now we're
getting somewhere.

04:24.898 --> 04:26.098
-Right.
-Now we're getting somewhere.

04:26.200 --> 04:29.568
¶¶

04:29.670 --> 04:31.036
Just touched him,
and he hit the door.

04:31.138 --> 04:33.405
He was gone.
He was gone
and won't come back.

04:33.507 --> 04:36.575
And it's a small town
and word travels.

04:36.677 --> 04:39.111
Okay. So now he's spreading
around the town...

04:39.213 --> 04:40.479
Right.
...that something in here

04:40.581 --> 04:42.314
made physical contact
with him,

04:42.416 --> 04:44.716
terrified him enough
to leave the building,

04:44.818 --> 04:47.219
and now you're stuck
with the haunted house...

04:47.321 --> 04:49.254
Right.
...that nobody wants
to go in or buy.

04:49.356 --> 04:51.289
Right.

04:51.392 --> 04:54.793
ZAK: We decide to conduct
a preliminary investigation

04:54.895 --> 04:57.729
hoping to use our expertise
in communication

04:57.831 --> 05:01.233
to help Malcolm get
this building under control,

05:01.335 --> 05:03.602
but also to help free
whatever spirits

05:03.704 --> 05:04.970
may be trapped here.

05:05.072 --> 05:09.408
Okay, right now we're walking in
for the very first time.

05:09.510 --> 05:11.410
We don't know a lot about this.

05:11.512 --> 05:13.412
We don't have a lot
of eyewitnesses

05:13.514 --> 05:17.516
because this place is just
locked up all the time.

05:17.618 --> 05:23.922
So what we're gonna do is
resort to our bodies,

05:24.024 --> 05:25.924
see if we walk
into a cloud of energy

05:26.026 --> 05:28.093
that just stops us
in our tracks.

05:28.195 --> 05:30.796
Then we can resort
to photography

05:30.898 --> 05:33.131
and audio recordings.

05:33.233 --> 05:35.967
Billy takes
full-spectrum photographs

05:36.070 --> 05:38.503
as I attempt to communicate.

05:38.605 --> 05:43.041
If you are the person who was
murdered here...

05:43.143 --> 05:45.644
not too long ago,

05:45.746 --> 05:47.979
we're here to help you.

05:48.082 --> 05:50.916
You were killed very suddenly
and very unexpectedly.

05:51.018 --> 05:52.484
I know that's scary.

05:52.586 --> 05:54.886
We are here to tell you
what happened.

05:54.988 --> 05:57.189

05:57.291 --> 05:59.958
This building has been
standing here a long time.

06:00.060 --> 06:03.228
The foundation has seen
the Siege of Vicksburg.

06:03.330 --> 06:05.230
So while we're calling out
to one spirit,

06:05.332 --> 06:08.600
we will remember that there
are other spirits here

06:08.702 --> 06:10.602
that may come across.

06:12.539 --> 06:14.506
So right now,
I haven't felt anything.

or sixth sense feelings yet.

which sags under the weight
of centuries of human suffering.

10:18.561 --> 10:20.994
It has seen
untold thousands of deaths

to this police officer.

10:42.785 --> 10:45.119
You mind if we pull up
a little bit, and I'll jump out?

10:45.221 --> 10:46.920
Sure.

10:47.022 --> 10:48.922

this place being haunted?

and seeing ghosts
and stuff of that nature.

10:56.699 --> 10:58.799
And what feeling do you get
when you go in there?

10:58.901 --> 11:00.234
It's a strange feeling.

11:00.336 --> 11:03.003
It'll give you a chill up
the back every once in a while.

This is one of those that
is a little on the dark side,

so much fear

We gotta be careful
with this one, guys.

12:08.771 --> 12:10.337
It's been 4 years
since I've been in here,

12:10.439 --> 12:11.972
so it's going to be
a little fuzzy.

12:12.074 --> 12:15.876
John Bullard had such
a terrifying experience

12:15.978 --> 12:16.944
in the hospital

12:17.046 --> 12:18.745
that he hasn't been
able to return.

12:18.848 --> 12:20.614
We were in here
for about 2 or 3 hours

12:20.716 --> 12:25.486
walking around the building,
and as we were in the building,

12:25.588 --> 12:27.721
and my anxiety is kind of up
right now...

12:27.823 --> 12:29.456
It's okay. It's okay.
...a little bit, so...

12:31.827 --> 12:33.060
...there's definitely
something in here.

12:33.162 --> 12:36.530
I feel like it's something
that's really aggressive.

12:36.632 --> 12:39.466
It -- it -- it makes me
very, very anxious.

12:41.670 --> 12:44.771
The more we stayed in here,
the stronger it got.

12:44.874 --> 12:46.540
And the more I felt
like I wasn't welcome,

12:46.642 --> 12:48.442
it felt like somebody was
bowing up on you.

12:48.544 --> 12:50.611
No matter what room you go,
they just followed you,

12:50.713 --> 12:52.579
they kept staring at you.

12:52.681 --> 12:56.450
John, did something here
in the hospital mark you?

12:56.552 --> 12:58.051
Yes, it did.

13:00.689 --> 13:02.523
I never experienced
anything like that.

13:02.625 --> 13:05.158
I makes you kind of rethink
what you're doing

13:05.261 --> 13:06.994
because it's easy to
watch it on TV,

13:07.096 --> 13:08.428
but when you get
in those moments

13:08.531 --> 13:10.664
and something
actually marks you,

13:10.766 --> 13:12.266
it takes it to
a whole nother level.

13:16.138 --> 13:19.139
ZAK: John's anxiety at being
back inside the building

13:19.241 --> 13:23.076
and opening up about his
deeply personal experience here

13:23.178 --> 13:25.846
has built to the point
to where he cannot continue...

13:25.948 --> 13:27.414
I didn't wanna come
back here.

His name was Michael, and every
time we'd mention his name,

he would start
cussing us out, so...

my other investigators,

to kill her.

me mentioning your name?

14:39.421 --> 14:42.656
-That was a hard boom, boom.
-Yep.

14:42.758 --> 14:44.925
Do you think
that's the wind?

14:47.963 --> 14:51.131

swinging in the wind,

14:51.233 --> 14:53.333

are left unexplained.

Do you think
Michael is human?

15:03.278 --> 15:05.245
No.
I think Michael's nonhuman.

Do you think that
he's mimicking a human?
Yeah.

investigations,

15:11.020 --> 15:13.020
we have found
that it is very common

I like that.
That's a good one.

18:10.898 --> 18:12.832
The reason why we called
Bill Chappell in

is we walked away

we wanted to really up

the presence of a spirit.

39:21.919 --> 39:24.953

to have shaken...

39:32.296 --> 39:35.130

compressed down, came back up.

So we saw changes
in X, Y, and Z in movement.

we saw about a 10 point shift.

that this board moved by itself,

abnormal environmental reading.

39:54.451 --> 39:58.353
We saw about a half a percent
increase in humidity,

39:58.455 --> 40:00.889
and that came up
and then went down in about

40:00.991 --> 40:03.225
1 1/2 seconds
through that whole span.

40:03.327 --> 40:05.227
Is that possible for humidity
to change that much?

40:05.329 --> 40:08.397
Well, it certainly is,
but we had a closed environment.

40:08.499 --> 40:10.265
ZAK:
All of the Elks Lodge windows

40:10.367 --> 40:13.602
were closed and sealed
to guard against

40:13.704 --> 40:16.004
any outside contamination
of evidence,

40:16.106 --> 40:18.340
so this sudden change
could not have been caused

40:18.442 --> 40:20.208
by outside factors.

40:20.311 --> 40:23.045
So let's just say
that this 4x4 piece of wood

40:23.147 --> 40:25.180
was moved by a spirit.
Okay.

40:25.282 --> 40:28.784

to build up enough energy,

40:28.886 --> 40:30.986
enough spiritual muscle,

40:31.088 --> 40:34.623
and disperse that energy
through the environment...

40:39.163 --> 40:42.531
onto an inanimate object
that has mass,

40:42.633 --> 40:46.268
could that moment
of manifestation and action

40:46.370 --> 40:49.004
cause these fluctuations
of environmental data?

40:49.106 --> 40:52.207

Yeah. I supposed it could.

may have done to them.

What if you set that up,
they didn't like that?

41:23.407 --> 41:24.506
-Oh, absolutely.
-You'd have been on the ground.

41:24.608 --> 41:26.441
...you would have been
very seriously hurt.

41:26.543 --> 41:28.043
-Mm-hmm.
-You understand that, right?

41:28.145 --> 41:29.211
Oh, absolutely.

41:29.313 --> 41:31.847
After examining the footage
more closely,

41:31.949 --> 41:33.882
we discover that
the 4x4 piece of wood

41:33.984 --> 41:38.553
jumps off the flat axis
of its perfectly square base

41:38.656 --> 41:41.690
and rapidly begins
to twist and spin

41:41.792 --> 41:45.961
as it unexplainably moves
to the ground with strong force.

41:46.063 --> 41:50.232
As a skeptical engineer,
scientist,

41:50.334 --> 41:52.734
you were within feet
of this event happening.

41:52.836 --> 41:54.770
-Correct.
-You saw the footage.

41:54.872 --> 41:56.304
-Mm-hmm.
-You collected data.

41:56.407 --> 41:59.174
-Mm-hmm.
-Can you explain it?

41:59.276 --> 42:00.842
No, I can't.
