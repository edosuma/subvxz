00:02.669 --> 00:04.671
[Crows caw]

00:04.672 --> 00:07.740
Frankie: There were seven
days left in the year of Sue,

00:07.741 --> 00:09.709
and Sue was livin' every minute of 'em.

00:09.710 --> 00:11.711
Aah! I got graduation tickets!

00:11.712 --> 00:14.781
Graduation tickets are here!
I've got 'em! [Screams]

00:14.782 --> 00:16.749
[Exhales] Here. Wait!

00:16.750 --> 00:18.785
Should I give 'em to you
or should I keep 'em?

00:18.786 --> 00:20.019
You. No, wait! Give 'em back.

00:20.020 --> 00:21.721
Because dad always does the
thing where he pretends

00:21.722 --> 00:23.022
he doesn't have 'em,

00:23.023 --> 00:24.724
and that's really funny when
I'm not the one graduating,

00:24.725 --> 00:25.792
but I don't think I could take
it if I'm the one graduating.

00:25.793 --> 00:26.893
[Screams]

00:26.894 --> 00:28.361
I'm the one graduating!

00:28.362 --> 00:30.296
[Screams] I'll keep the tickets.

00:30.297 --> 00:31.898
This year, I have a whole plan.

00:31.899 --> 00:34.133
We're not gonna roll in
late like we always do.

00:34.134 --> 00:35.935
I slipped the janitor a six-pack

00:35.936 --> 00:39.005
and got us front row
seats and a parking spot

00:39.006 --> 00:40.106
right by the exit.

00:40.107 --> 00:41.808
We'll be the first ones out.

00:41.809 --> 00:44.210
Why are you always rushing things?

00:44.211 --> 00:45.378
We haven't even gotten to the graduation,

00:45.379 --> 00:46.746
you're already talking about leaving.

00:46.747 --> 00:48.448
Yeah! We're gonna wanna take pictures,

00:48.449 --> 00:50.783
you're gonna wanna meet my teachers.

00:50.784 --> 00:52.852
Am I? I mean, if I haven't
met 'em to this point...

00:52.853 --> 00:54.354
[Telephone ringing]

00:54.355 --> 00:55.955
[Ring]

00:55.956 --> 00:57.223
- [Phone beeps]
- Hello?

00:57.224 --> 00:59.158
So how is my party planning going?

00:59.159 --> 01:00.960
Are you all ready for my graduation party?

01:00.961 --> 01:02.428
I can't believe I get to
party with my parents

01:02.429 --> 01:04.163
on graduation night!

01:04.164 --> 01:06.299
Oh, I wanna thank you.

01:06.300 --> 01:08.668
You have been my sunshine
ever since you were born.

01:08.669 --> 01:10.937
You were the baby that
would not stop smiling.

01:10.938 --> 01:12.839
I had to ask the nurses
if there was something

01:12.840 --> 01:14.007
wrong with you, but they did tests,

01:14.008 --> 01:15.275
and you were just happy!

01:15.276 --> 01:18.678
And now you're all grown
up and you're graduating,

01:18.679 --> 01:20.947
and you're letting me be involved. Oh.

01:20.948 --> 01:22.682
Oh, mom!

01:22.683 --> 01:25.184
I love you. I so want you involved.

01:25.185 --> 01:27.020
And this isn't just my day.

01:27.021 --> 01:29.822
This is about the whole family's success.

01:29.823 --> 01:30.957
Ha!

01:30.958 --> 01:34.193
I'm graduating! [Chuckles]

01:36.729 --> 01:38.097
So glad we had a girl.

01:38.098 --> 01:40.099
Well, hang on to that feeling,
'cause that was Brick's school.

01:40.100 --> 01:41.668
They want us to come in for a meeting.

01:41.669 --> 01:44.270
[Groans] Stupid boys.

01:44.271 --> 01:47.173
Brad! Brad! The yearbooks are in!

01:47.174 --> 01:49.342
- I know, I know! Gimme, gimme, gimme.
- Here!

01:49.343 --> 01:52.312
Three years of bad pictures, and
it took me till senior year

01:52.313 --> 01:54.080
to finally make sure I got a good one.

01:54.081 --> 01:55.982
Ah! Yes!

01:55.983 --> 01:59.018
In her first decent picture
in four years of high school,

01:59.019 --> 02:00.820
it's...

02:00.821 --> 02:02.689
Ana Hajarajanaan?

02:02.690 --> 02:06.689
Why is the name under my first
good picture Ana Hajarajanaan?

02:07.760 --> 02:09.862
Ugh.

02:09.863 --> 02:11.297
How does this happen, brad?

02:11.298 --> 02:12.799
How does my best friend

02:12.800 --> 02:14.033
on the yearbook committee let this happen?!

02:14.034 --> 02:15.268
I don't know, Sue.

02:15.269 --> 02:16.703
I'm not in charge of that
part of the yearbook.

02:16.704 --> 02:19.005
Somehow, I just ended up
in charge of choosing pics

02:19.006 --> 02:21.874
- for wrestling and the guys swim team.
- Okay.

02:21.875 --> 02:23.810
So it happened.

02:23.811 --> 02:25.311
I'm not gonna let this get me down.

02:25.312 --> 02:26.746
Here, here.

02:26.747 --> 02:30.216
Sign my senior page with
our sombrero pic. Yay.

02:30.217 --> 02:31.851
[Inhales deeply, exhales sharply]

02:34.320 --> 02:36.356
The fold? Seriously?

02:37.724 --> 02:40.059
[School bell rings]

02:40.060 --> 02:43.196
Hello, summer! Goodbye, pants.

02:43.197 --> 02:45.732
I will see you in September.

02:46.124 --> 02:47.667
- There's my "welcome home" sandwich.
- [Door closes]

02:47.668 --> 02:49.836
Ha ha.

02:49.837 --> 02:51.704
[Mouth full] Mmm.

02:51.705 --> 02:54.173
Oh, don't worry. I'll share.

02:54.174 --> 02:56.709
- There you go.
- [Remote clicks, tv turns on]

02:56.710 --> 03:00.813
So for my future reference,
what happens in college?

03:00.814 --> 03:02.682
How exactly does the
whole summer thing work?

03:02.683 --> 03:03.950
What happens to hutch?

03:03.951 --> 03:06.686
Well, he goes back to his house in Chicago.

03:06.687 --> 03:08.755
So what happens to Devin?

03:08.756 --> 03:10.323
Goes back to her house in Idaho.

03:10.324 --> 03:12.959
So you guys aren't dating anymore?

03:12.960 --> 03:15.128
No... well, no, we're... Still together.

03:15.129 --> 03:16.929
Oh, so you talked about it?

03:16.930 --> 03:19.932
No. See, that's what makes Devin so cool.

03:19.933 --> 03:22.769
We don't have to talk everything to death.
It just is.

03:22.770 --> 03:24.103
Some girls will be all over you, like,

03:24.104 --> 03:25.705
"what are we doing?
What's our relationship?"

03:25.706 --> 03:27.940
But Devin's not like that. She's cool.

03:27.941 --> 03:30.777
So she could date other people?

03:30.778 --> 03:33.946
[Scoffs] Yeah, I mean,
technically, she could,

03:33.947 --> 03:35.748
but she's not.

03:35.749 --> 03:37.049
I mean, I could, too, if I wanted to.

03:37.050 --> 03:38.317
But I'm not, but I mean, I could.

03:38.318 --> 03:40.820
So, whatever, it's cool.

03:40.821 --> 03:42.188
Totally cool.

03:42.189 --> 03:44.724
[Sucks lip]

03:44.725 --> 03:48.320
Okay, you're not gonna believe
the school meeting I just had.

03:48.321 --> 03:49.794
Well, the good part is he can't

03:49.795 --> 03:51.297
- be tried as an adult.
- No, no, no.

03:51.298 --> 03:52.832
They think he's so smart,

03:52.833 --> 03:54.167
they want him to skip eighth grade

03:54.168 --> 03:55.935
and go right into high school.

03:55.936 --> 03:58.805
What? That's nuts. Why
would we agree to that?

03:58.806 --> 04:00.039
You should've heard the principal.

04:00.040 --> 04:01.774
He said Brick's extra smart.

04:01.775 --> 04:03.276
His brain is superior to the other kids.

04:03.277 --> 04:04.977
I mean, we don't want him to be bored.

04:04.978 --> 04:06.746
Eh, I don't like the idea.

04:06.747 --> 04:08.114
He's got no friends in middle school,

04:08.115 --> 04:09.849
you think he's gonna make
friends in high school?

04:09.850 --> 04:11.117
Plus all the kids'll be bigger.

04:11.118 --> 04:12.819
You can forget about him making any teams.

04:12.820 --> 04:14.187
Oh, would you give that up already?

04:14.188 --> 04:15.455
That's not happening.

04:15.456 --> 04:17.890
He threw out his shoulder tossing a dart.

04:17.891 --> 04:19.192
Hey, if you let go of thinkin'

04:19.192 --> 04:21.461
we're gonna have bowls of
fresh fruit in the house,

04:21.462 --> 04:23.896
- I'll let go of sports.
- [Sighs heavily]

04:23.897 --> 04:25.164
Oh, I don't know, maybe you're right.

04:25.165 --> 04:27.233
Maybe we should take into
consideration the social stuff.

04:27.234 --> 04:28.835
On the plus side,

04:28.836 --> 04:31.170
in four more years, we'd
have no kids in the house.

04:31.171 --> 04:32.639
One year closer to freedom.

04:32.640 --> 04:35.108
Okay, I'm sorry. There you go again.

04:35.109 --> 04:37.977
Rush, rush, rush. Wishing our lives away.

04:37.978 --> 04:41.080
Sue's graduating. Now you really
wanna push Brick out the door?

04:41.081 --> 04:42.649
Now, wait, aren't you the
one that wanted to do this?

04:42.650 --> 04:44.484
I just said, maybe, you're right.

04:44.485 --> 04:45.918
I know, but now I'm agreeing with you.

04:45.919 --> 04:47.954
I've come over to your point.
You've convinced me.

04:47.955 --> 04:50.056
Are you agreeing with me now
or agreeing with me before?

04:50.057 --> 04:52.025
- What side are you on now?
- I don't know.

04:52.026 --> 04:53.720
Why don't we just ask Brick what he thinks?

04:53.721 --> 04:54.766
- Brick!
- Wait!

04:54.767 --> 04:56.484
Shouldn't we know what we think
before we ask him what he thinks?

04:56.485 --> 04:57.896
Would you stop yelling at me?

04:57.897 --> 05:00.366
Why can't we ever have a normal discussion?

05:00.367 --> 05:02.234
- I'm not yelling!
- What's all the yelling?

05:02.235 --> 05:04.203
- Are you guys fighting?
- We're not fighting. We're fine.

05:04.204 --> 05:05.871
Your father and I are
having a heated agreement.

05:05.872 --> 05:07.272
Look, Brick, here's the deal,

05:07.273 --> 05:09.274
your mom had a meeting with your principal.

05:09.275 --> 05:11.243
I didn't do it. I'm not doing that anymore.

05:11.244 --> 05:13.345
[Clicks teeth]

05:13.346 --> 05:15.314
Well, whatever it was, you
clearly got away with it,

05:15.315 --> 05:17.282
so let us just tell you
what the meeting was about.

05:17.283 --> 05:19.585
They think maybe you're
ready to skip eighth grade

05:19.586 --> 05:21.286
and go straight in high school.

05:21.287 --> 05:22.888
Really? Hmm.

05:22.889 --> 05:24.523
Okay, sounds good.

05:24.524 --> 05:26.258
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

05:26.259 --> 05:28.327
It's kind of a big decision.
Don't you wanna think about it?

05:28.328 --> 05:31.230
Well, the truth is I am kind
of bored in middle school,

05:31.231 --> 05:33.298
and the boys in my class
are really childish.

05:33.299 --> 05:34.800
They draw boobs on everything.

05:34.801 --> 05:36.769
Yeah, I'm not really
sure that's gonna change

05:36.770 --> 05:38.237
in high school.

05:38.238 --> 05:39.938
You know, I was kinda
dreading the eighth grade.

05:39.939 --> 05:41.940
But now I might even look
forward to the fall.

05:41.941 --> 05:43.342
And now it's even less likely

05:43.343 --> 05:45.377
there'll be any repercussions from the...

05:47.246 --> 05:48.580
Well, you said you didn't wanna know.

05:48.581 --> 05:50.916
Nah.

05:50.917 --> 05:54.386
Hey, Carly. Uh, do you know
what happened to my yearbook?

05:54.387 --> 05:57.222
Brad said he might've given it to you.

05:57.223 --> 05:59.291
Yeah, yeah, Ana Hajarajanaan.

05:59.292 --> 06:03.529
I know. Super funny.

06:03.530 --> 06:07.866
- So, okay. Yep, thanks. I'll check. Bye.
- [Telephone beeps]

06:07.867 --> 06:09.020
Sue, will you look at this?

06:09.021 --> 06:11.866
No way, Axl.
I have fallen for that joke too many times.

06:12.438 --> 06:13.839
No, relax, it's not that.

06:13.840 --> 06:16.675
It's a picture on Instagram
of Devin and some dude.

06:16.676 --> 06:20.345
Damn. I didn't know you could
carry a kayak with one arm.

06:20.346 --> 06:22.714
Yeah. I know. But if you saw this guy,

06:22.715 --> 06:24.850
you'd think he was a total tool, right?

06:24.851 --> 06:26.351
Yeah, probably.

06:26.352 --> 06:27.786
A smokin' hot tool

06:27.787 --> 06:29.688
who's kayaking with your girlfriend.

06:29.689 --> 06:31.857
If she even is my girlfriend.

06:31.858 --> 06:34.326
What do you mean? How did
you leave it over summer?

06:34.327 --> 06:36.228
[Sighs heavily] We didn't say anything.

06:36.229 --> 06:39.198
Well, she's cool, okay? I
mean, she's not clingy.

06:39.199 --> 06:40.466
That's why she's awesome. She's like a guy.

06:40.467 --> 06:42.334
We're keepin' it loose. She's cool!

06:42.335 --> 06:43.902
Okay.

06:43.903 --> 06:45.938
Fine. What do you think of this picture?

06:45.939 --> 06:48.841
Ew! Axl, gross!

06:48.842 --> 06:51.343
[Laughs] That is never not funny.

06:51.344 --> 06:54.580
Oh, hi, principal Cameron.
Are you guys still open?

06:54.581 --> 06:59.023
Yes, yes, just faxing my resumée
to TGI Friday's for the summer.

06:59.952 --> 07:01.587
Fingers crossed.

07:01.588 --> 07:03.589
[Chuckles] I actually
just wanted to check in

07:03.590 --> 07:04.590
on my attendance award.

07:04.591 --> 07:06.525
Oh, are you Lynnette Perry?

07:06.526 --> 07:07.726
No. I'm Sue Heck.

07:07.727 --> 07:08.861
Mm.

07:08.862 --> 07:11.330
You might know me as Ana Hajarajanaan?

07:11.331 --> 07:14.266
I'm fairly sure that Lynnette Perry

07:14.267 --> 07:15.534
is getting the attendance award.

07:15.535 --> 07:16.835
- No.
- Ah, yes.

07:16.836 --> 07:18.504
Ah, she only missed a single day.

07:18.505 --> 07:20.506
- But I only missed a single day.
- [Typing]

07:20.507 --> 07:23.675
No. No, it says here that
you've snuck off campus

07:23.676 --> 07:25.310
another day to go to lunch at...

07:25.311 --> 07:28.747
- [Key clicks]
- Arby's, was it?

07:28.748 --> 07:31.250
But I didn't even finish my sandwich.

07:31.251 --> 07:32.684
You don't understand.

07:32.685 --> 07:34.887
Winning this award has been
a goal of mine for years.

07:34.888 --> 07:37.689
I mean, I came to school
against doctor's orders

07:37.690 --> 07:39.258
so many times.

07:39.259 --> 07:41.894
Yes, and then apparently,
you went to Arby's.

07:41.895 --> 07:45.894
But... If you go back, would
you drop this off for me?

07:46.265 --> 07:50.802
And tell them that I have a
degree in higher education?

07:50.803 --> 07:53.338
Did anybody find a yearbook?

07:54.738 --> 07:57.043
Well, my yearbook is
missing, and apparently,

07:57.044 --> 07:58.549
three bites of a roast beef sandwich

07:58.550 --> 08:00.781
robbed me my chance of
the attendance award.

08:00.782 --> 08:03.761
The year of Sue is not ending well, people.

08:03.762 --> 08:05.168
Not ending well at all!

08:05.169 --> 08:06.664
Hey, wait a minute.

08:06.665 --> 08:08.496
If I'm skipping the eighth grade,

08:08.497 --> 08:10.633
technically, that means I'm
graduating this year, too.

08:10.634 --> 08:11.820
Shouldn't I have a party?

08:11.821 --> 08:14.471
[Exhales] Brick, I can barely scrape
the funds together for one party.

08:14.472 --> 08:16.703
I am this close to frosting a loaf of bread

08:16.704 --> 08:17.775
and passing it off as a cake.

08:17.776 --> 08:19.895
No, I totally get that.
We can just have one.

08:19.896 --> 08:22.703
Me and Sue can combine ours.
I'll start texting invites now.

08:22.704 --> 08:26.870
What? No! No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no!

08:26.871 --> 08:28.183
This is my graduation,

08:28.184 --> 08:30.127
and Brick is not just
gonna glom onto my party.

08:30.128 --> 08:32.671
Hey! Excuse me, you cannot stand there.

08:32.672 --> 08:35.572
I got an old shadow and a
dork shadow in my shot.

08:35.573 --> 08:36.839
What are you doing?

08:36.840 --> 08:37.900
What does it look like I'm doing?

08:37.902 --> 08:40.799
I'm trying to take a pretend
selfie in a fake club

08:40.799 --> 08:43.150
- to make my girlfriend jealous.
- [Camera shutter clicks]

08:43.152 --> 08:44.547
Now, should our cakes say,

08:44.548 --> 08:46.687
"Sue and Brick" or "Brick and Sue"?

08:46.688 --> 08:49.217
I don't know. I'm thinking
alphabetical would be the most fair.

08:50.205 --> 08:51.455
Seriously, mom,

08:51.456 --> 08:53.982
you are not seriously thinking
about combining parties?

08:53.983 --> 08:55.749
I mean, this is the year of Sue,

08:55.750 --> 08:57.526
not the year of Sue and Brick.

08:57.527 --> 08:59.240
I thought we landed on Brick and Sue.

08:59.241 --> 09:01.187
You don't wanna combine
parties with her, Brick.

09:01.188 --> 09:02.192
It's gonna be lame.

09:02.193 --> 09:04.545
Ooh, R.S.V.P.s are rollin' in.

09:04.546 --> 09:07.513
All the kids from my social
skills group seem to be free.

09:07.514 --> 09:10.451
He can't have people R.S.V.P.
Into the party.

09:10.452 --> 09:11.981
- This is my party!
- [Door closes]

09:11.982 --> 09:13.753
Okay, got my janitor buddy

09:13.754 --> 09:15.440
to slip me an early copy of the program.

09:15.441 --> 09:17.504
It all starts at 2:00,

09:17.505 --> 09:19.771
but he says as long as we're
in our seats at 1:55,

09:19.772 --> 09:22.923
we'll be good. Uh, Ehlert's
gonna start with the pledge...

09:22.924 --> 09:24.198
Wait. What? What do you mean,

09:24.199 --> 09:25.581
"Ehlert's gonna start with the pledge"?

09:25.582 --> 09:27.839
No, sergeant at arms
always does the pledge.

09:27.840 --> 09:30.872
I am sergeant at arms. I am
supposed to do the pledge.

09:30.873 --> 09:33.600
I guess Ehlert donated a
bunch of money or something.

09:33.601 --> 09:35.144
Says he's gonna repave the parking lot.

09:35.145 --> 09:37.633
Oh, my god!

09:37.634 --> 09:39.832
That's how America works now?

09:39.833 --> 09:42.851
Apparently, anyone who donates
money gets to exert influence?

09:42.852 --> 09:44.867
That is not the America I know!

09:44.868 --> 09:46.636
Axl: Get used to it, Sue.

09:46.637 --> 09:49.294
Deception and dishonesty
are ways people get ahead.

09:49.295 --> 09:51.251
What's real? What's fake? Who knows?

09:51.252 --> 09:52.756
It's like you can't trust anyone anymore.

09:52.757 --> 09:55.315
[Chuckles] Oh! What's that, Kate Upton?

09:55.316 --> 09:56.779
That's hilarious!

10:02.835 --> 10:04.436
- Brick, look at this.
- [Groans]

10:04.437 --> 10:06.105
No way, Axl.

10:06.106 --> 10:07.907
- I've fallen for that joke too many times.
- No, it's not that.

10:07.908 --> 10:10.409
Now she's rock climbing
with some bearded dude.

10:10.410 --> 10:11.944
The kayaking guy?

10:11.945 --> 10:13.078
No, this is a new one. Look.

10:13.079 --> 10:14.780
[Sighs]

10:14.781 --> 10:16.949
Whoa. Damn.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.384
Is that his arm?

10:18.385 --> 10:20.286
So muscular. I thought it was a leg.

10:20.287 --> 10:22.221
I know, Brick, I'm freakin' out here.

10:22.222 --> 10:23.555
I keep texting her,

10:23.556 --> 10:25.925
but she just responds with
these one-word answers.

10:25.926 --> 10:27.459
I say, uh, "what are you doin' today?"

10:27.460 --> 10:28.961
She says, "nothin'."

10:28.962 --> 10:29.962
I say, "you enjoying your summer?"

10:29.963 --> 10:33.866
She says, "ya." "Ya"? What even is that?

10:33.867 --> 10:36.168
I blew it, Brick! And now she's
dating these action dudes,

10:36.169 --> 10:37.903
and I'm in a club in my kitchen!

10:37.904 --> 10:40.039
[Groans]

10:40.040 --> 10:42.341
You know what? I gotta tell her how I feel.

10:42.342 --> 10:44.877
That's it. I'm driving to
Idaho to get my woman back!

10:44.878 --> 10:46.345
You can't drive all the way to Idaho.

10:46.346 --> 10:48.047
You'll miss Sue's graduation.

10:48.048 --> 10:50.182
I'll drive fast. I'll put it in my G.P.S.

10:50.183 --> 10:52.284
Hmm? Here, this look right to you?

10:52.285 --> 10:54.754
Oh, Axl, disgusting!

10:54.755 --> 10:55.821
Never not funny!

10:59.792 --> 11:01.093
Okay, I just gotta run into the party store

11:01.094 --> 11:04.396
and get some cups, plates,
balloons, plastic table covers,

11:04.397 --> 11:07.199
oh, and Sue wants this eagle
banner she saw that says,

11:07.200 --> 11:08.801
"you're soarin' now."

11:08.802 --> 11:09.835
- Hmm.
- [Seat belt clicks]

11:09.836 --> 11:11.203
No, no, no, no.

11:11.204 --> 11:13.172
You stay here. You're
just gonna slow me down.

11:13.173 --> 11:15.207
Oh, okay.

11:15.208 --> 11:17.543
What was the matter with me?

11:17.544 --> 11:19.144
I was gonna let this kid go to high school,

11:19.145 --> 11:20.879
but not run a few errands?

11:20.880 --> 11:24.483
Maybe he's more mature than
I give him credit for.

11:24.484 --> 11:27.219
You know what? I'm gonna
let you take care of this.

11:27.220 --> 11:28.821
Really? Okay.

11:28.822 --> 11:31.423
You wanted cups, plates,
balloons, plastic table covers,

11:31.424 --> 11:33.559
and a "you're soarin' now" banner, right?

11:33.560 --> 11:36.261
[Chuckles] Wow. You're right.

11:36.262 --> 11:39.398
Okay, here's some money to cover it.

11:39.399 --> 11:41.500
I'm on it.

11:44.103 --> 11:46.872
Okay, can everyone who's signing a yearbook

11:46.873 --> 11:48.874
please just check that the
yearbook in your hand

11:48.875 --> 11:51.844
is, indeed, yours? Mine has been misplaced.

11:51.845 --> 11:54.413
It has my name on it in pink puffy pen.

11:54.414 --> 11:57.349
Thank you for your time.

11:57.350 --> 11:58.917
Next.

11:58.918 --> 12:01.320
- [Blows raspberry]
- Hi. Sue Sue Heck.

12:01.321 --> 12:04.089
All righty, and do you
have any honor cords?

12:04.090 --> 12:05.424
I don't know. What are they?

12:05.425 --> 12:06.959
Well, you wear them with your cap and gown

12:06.960 --> 12:08.527
in recognition of your
high school achievements.

12:08.528 --> 12:11.497
Yellow is for honor society,
green is for math club.

12:11.498 --> 12:13.265
Oh, is there one for student council?

12:13.266 --> 12:15.100
Yes, absolutely, are you
on student council?

12:15.101 --> 12:16.869
Yes, I am sergeant at arms.

12:16.870 --> 12:19.905
Darn, so close. It's treasurer and above.

12:19.906 --> 12:23.175
Oh, J.P.L.A.? School mascot?

12:23.176 --> 12:24.843
Hey! I founded wrestlerettes.

12:24.844 --> 12:26.879
Oh! Well, there you go, then.

12:26.880 --> 12:28.480
Red is for varsity athletics.

12:28.481 --> 12:29.915
[Squeals]

12:29.916 --> 12:32.084
Oh, wait, I don't see
wrestlerettes on my clipboard

12:32.085 --> 12:35.020
of cord-sanctioned activities. What?

12:35.021 --> 12:37.489
Looks like it's not really a sport.
I'm sorry.

12:37.490 --> 12:38.924
Yeah, yeah.

12:38.925 --> 12:41.360
So just the cap and gown, then?

12:41.361 --> 12:43.095
Just the cap and gown.

12:43.096 --> 12:45.264
I'm sorry. We're out of medium-sized caps.

12:45.265 --> 12:46.465
We only have large.

12:46.466 --> 12:48.367
Just have your mom stuff it with tissue.

12:48.368 --> 12:52.171
Okay. [Chuckles]

12:52.172 --> 12:55.274
It had been half an hour.

12:55.275 --> 12:57.076
It shouldn't have taken that long.

12:57.077 --> 12:58.911
But if I just marched
in there and took over,

12:58.912 --> 13:01.947
how would I ever give Brick
a chance to prove himself?

13:09.855 --> 13:10.856
Brick?

13:10.857 --> 13:12.424
Oh, hi, mom.

13:12.425 --> 13:13.892
What are you doing?

13:13.893 --> 13:15.094
Why are you dressed like that?

13:15.095 --> 13:16.528
And where's the stuff for the party?

13:16.529 --> 13:18.797
What party?

13:18.798 --> 13:21.834
Yeah, you're not going to high school.

13:21.835 --> 13:24.269
Mm. So it took 20 seconds
to figure that out.

13:24.270 --> 13:26.271
Unfortunately, it took 11 hours of driving

13:26.272 --> 13:28.941
for Axl to figure out what
looked like an inch and a half

13:28.942 --> 13:31.877
on his phone, was actually a little longer.

13:31.878 --> 13:33.545
Female automated voice: Stay on 1-80,

13:33.546 --> 13:37.545
then, turn right in 1,407 miles.

13:38.283 --> 13:40.085
What?

13:40.086 --> 13:42.087
Frankie: And he knew that if he kept going,

13:42.088 --> 13:44.056
he might impress one girl,

13:44.057 --> 13:46.525
but he would definitely crush another.

13:46.526 --> 13:47.793
[Tires squeal]

13:51.263 --> 13:52.765
Unfortunately, Mike's graduation game plan

13:52.766 --> 13:54.233
was off to a bad start...

13:54.234 --> 13:56.702
[Horn honks] What's the holdup?!

13:56.703 --> 13:57.803
[Door squeaks]

13:57.804 --> 14:00.572
Whew.

14:00.573 --> 14:01.674
Oh, wait, I forgot a book.

14:01.675 --> 14:03.008
[Door opens] No, no turning back!

14:03.009 --> 14:05.978
Frankie! One second! She's not ready yet.

14:05.979 --> 14:07.813
He's only holding the seats till 2:00.
[Brakes squeal]

14:07.814 --> 14:11.150
We can kiss the seats goodbye.
[Car door closes]

14:11.151 --> 14:14.820
Oh, good, you're here. Get in.
Where you going?!

14:14.821 --> 14:17.289
I gotta pee! I've been in
the car a zillion hours.

14:17.290 --> 14:18.590
[Door squeaks]

14:18.591 --> 14:20.893
Really, Axl? Idaho?

14:20.894 --> 14:22.194
Sue, what is going on?

14:22.195 --> 14:24.697
I thought you of all people
would be ready to go!

14:24.698 --> 14:28.367
- Out.
- [Horn honks]

14:28.368 --> 14:29.668
Sue?

14:29.669 --> 14:31.603
What's goin' on? Why aren't you ready?

14:31.604 --> 14:33.572
I don't know if I should even go.

14:33.573 --> 14:35.808
I'm not going. What's the point?

14:35.809 --> 14:37.643
What? What are you talking about?

14:37.644 --> 14:39.111
I have no legacy, mom.

14:39.112 --> 14:41.714
[Sighs] It's like I didn't even exist.

14:41.715 --> 14:43.079
- [Horn honks]
- Oh, honey,

14:43.080 --> 14:45.422
is this something we could talk about
on the way to the ceremony?

14:45.423 --> 14:47.319
I don't have a cord or a yearbook

14:47.320 --> 14:49.688
or an attendance plaque.

14:49.689 --> 14:51.223
I won't be saying the pledge,

14:51.224 --> 14:53.592
and I can't go back and
watch wrestlerette practice

14:53.593 --> 14:55.661
because there will be no wrestlerettes.

14:55.662 --> 14:58.630
All I wanted to do was make a difference

14:58.631 --> 15:00.733
and leave a mark, and I didn't.

15:00.734 --> 15:04.636
It's like I wasn't even there.
I just feel insignificant.

15:04.637 --> 15:05.637
[Horn honks]

15:05.638 --> 15:08.107
[Sighs] One second.

15:08.108 --> 15:11.944
Just give me a minute!
She feels insignificant!

15:11.945 --> 15:13.779
Tell her we all do and to get in the car!

15:13.780 --> 15:15.014
I'm working on it!

15:15.015 --> 15:16.048
Well, fix it fast, Frankie!

15:18.784 --> 15:19.885
Okay, you know what, honey?

15:19.886 --> 15:21.754
I think once you get to your graduation,

15:21.755 --> 15:23.856
you'll see all your friends and
you'll feel so much better.

15:23.857 --> 15:24.957
So let's just get up, okay?

15:24.958 --> 15:26.658
Come on, up, up, up, up, up, up, up.

15:26.659 --> 15:28.293
Doesn't matter. No one will miss me.

15:28.294 --> 15:29.762
No one will care. Who will care?

15:29.763 --> 15:31.730
Well, I'll care.

15:31.731 --> 15:34.867
I just wanna see my
little sunshine graduate

15:34.868 --> 15:38.303
from high school and then
go to that awesome party

15:38.304 --> 15:41.640
that we have been planning for months.

15:41.641 --> 15:43.742
[Groans] How do you work
these damn buckles?

15:43.743 --> 15:45.744
It's like I didn't even exist.

15:45.745 --> 15:47.146
It's like I walked on sand

15:47.147 --> 15:49.748
and didn't even leave any footprints.

15:49.749 --> 15:52.051
And not like the Jesus story that was fun.

15:52.052 --> 15:54.753
- [Horn honks]
- [Sighs]

15:57.089 --> 15:58.190
I said I...

15:58.191 --> 16:00.292
What is with this family?

16:00.293 --> 16:03.095
Why can't we get anywhere on time?!

16:03.096 --> 16:05.230
I told you, I'm working on it!

16:06.541 --> 16:08.477
Okay, Sue, seriously, your
dad's not kidding around.

16:08.478 --> 16:09.501
We gotta go!

16:09.502 --> 16:12.771
Okay, I got her.

16:12.772 --> 16:15.874
Nothing matters, dad. What does it matter?

16:15.875 --> 16:18.277
Okay, good conversation for the car.

16:21.713 --> 16:24.016
[Applause]

16:24.017 --> 16:25.617
[Amplified voice] Well,
that was certainly worth

16:25.618 --> 16:27.619
the new blacktop in the
teacher's parking lot, huh?

16:27.620 --> 16:29.054
All right, let's get this started, huh?

16:29.055 --> 16:30.956
What do you say? A to Z this year?

16:30.957 --> 16:32.724
Ah, let's do it. All right. [Mouths words]

16:32.725 --> 16:36.724
Ben Adams, huh?

16:38.163 --> 16:42.067
So Sue sat there with two
shoes on the wrong feet,

16:42.068 --> 16:44.269
no cords, no legacy.

16:44.270 --> 16:47.239
I'd honestly never seen her this low.

16:47.240 --> 16:49.842
But then, an amazing thing happened.

16:49.843 --> 16:52.711

I swear, I never once saw
you in a bad mood...

17:22.876 --> 17:25.644
You made me feel so much better
when I didn't make show choir

to talk all that much,
