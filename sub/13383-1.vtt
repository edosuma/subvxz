00:31.960 --> 00:36.966
Roy Acuff, as you know, has been a big star
at the Opry here for quite some time.

00:37.840 --> 00:40.446
We have a company,
a music publishing company.

00:43.040 --> 00:45.486
But, yeah, I liked Hank right off.

00:46.120 --> 00:50.648
I think it's 'cause he didn't give a darn
if you liked him or not.

00:57.920 --> 01:02.420
I tried so hard, my dear

01:02.520 --> 01:08.766
To show that you're my every dream

01:10.480 --> 01:15.964
Yet you're afraid each thing I do

01:16.720 --> 01:21.123
Is just some evil scheme

01:22.840 --> 01:27.687
A memory from your lonesome past

01:28.640 --> 01:34.170
Keeps us so far apart

01:35.840 --> 01:41.324
Why can't I free your doubtful mind

01:42.680 --> 01:48.847
And melt your cold, cold heart

01:54.600 --> 02:00.323
Another love before my time

02:01.040 --> 02:05.329
Made your heart sad and blue

02:06.880 --> 02:12.603
And so my heart is paying now

02:13.400 --> 02:18.008
For things I didn't do

02:18.720 --> 02:23.965
In anger unkind words are said

02:25.280 --> 02:31.322
That made the teardrops start

02:33.240 --> 02:38.929
Why can't I free your doubtful mind

02:39.440 --> 02:45.482
And melt your cold, cold heart

03:26.240 --> 03:29.180
You know what time
I get up every morning, Hank?

03:29.280 --> 03:31.020
No idea, sir.

03:31.120 --> 03:32.281
4:45.

03:32.720 --> 03:34.848
Sun don't never ever beat me.

03:36.160 --> 03:38.527
Then know what I did at 6:15?

03:38.920 --> 03:40.500
Listen to my radio show?

03:40.600 --> 03:42.020
On WSFA?

03:42.120 --> 03:44.088
Nope. I had my breakfast.

03:45.560 --> 03:47.340
Well, fair enough, I guess.

03:47.440 --> 03:50.140
We ain't that big
or we wouldn't be singin' at that hour.

03:50.240 --> 03:51.700
Nah, I was just kidding around.

03:51.800 --> 03:53.500
I listen to your program
every now and then.

03:53.600 --> 03:54.580
- You do?
- Yeah.

03:54.680 --> 03:56.300
- What do you think?
- That's pretty good stuff.

03:56.400 --> 03:57.970
Well, pretty fair.

03:59.640 --> 04:00.740
All right, now.

04:00.840 --> 04:04.003
Just a couple more
little Justice of the Peace details.

04:04.440 --> 04:07.740
So, this is your license
and divorce decree, Miss Guy?

04:07.840 --> 04:09.020
Well, I'm Miss Sheppard now.

04:09.120 --> 04:10.900
Guy was Erksine's surname.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.420
But these divorce papers
are in order, right?

04:13.520 --> 04:14.700
They definitely are.

04:14.800 --> 04:17.060
Mr. Guy and I took care of that.

04:17.160 --> 04:19.940
You'll take notice that
it's been notarized as well?

04:20.040 --> 04:21.690
Yeah, I see that.

04:22.160 --> 04:25.209
- Just 10 days ago, huh?
- Yeah.

04:25.960 --> 04:28.201
Well, to the business at hand.

04:29.160 --> 04:32.780
Just because these ceilings aren't vaulted
and the windows aren't stained glass

04:32.880 --> 04:35.406
doesn't mean this union
is any less sacred.

04:37.360 --> 04:38.980
Audrey Mae Sheppard,

04:39.080 --> 04:45.740
do you take Hiram King Hank Williams
to love and honor in all duty and service,

04:45.840 --> 04:49.890
to live with him and cherish him
according to the bonds of marriage?

04:50.720 --> 04:52.165
I sure will.

04:52.960 --> 04:55.460
And do you, Hiram King Hank Williams,

04:55.560 --> 04:59.460
have this woman, Audrey Mae Sheppard,
to be your wife?

04:59.560 --> 05:04.740
And will you promise faithfulness in all
love and honor and all duty and service

05:04.840 --> 05:08.128
to live with her
according to the bonds of marriage?

05:09.560 --> 05:10.800
I will.

05:10.960 --> 05:13.060
Then by the authority vested in me,

05:13.160 --> 05:15.891
from the County of Covington
in the state of Alabama,

05:16.000 --> 05:17.923
I declare you husband and wife.

05:18.200 --> 05:21.020
I've tried and I've tried

05:21.120 --> 05:23.340
And all night long I've cried

05:23.440 --> 05:27.286
But I can't get you off of my mind

05:36.040 --> 05:37.540
All right, folks.

05:37.640 --> 05:39.927
Now I'm gonna play a little tune for ya.

05:40.720 --> 05:42.980
It might make sense to y'all.

05:43.080 --> 05:48.450
Tonight or this mornin',
whatever the hell it is.

05:49.080 --> 05:50.730
Don, don't screw it up.

05:51.120 --> 05:53.487
- I'll try not to, bub.
- Let's roll.

06:24.320 --> 06:29.645
When you are sad and lonely
And have no place to go

06:30.480 --> 06:34.804
Come to see me, baby
And bring along some dough

06:34.960 --> 06:39.409
And we'll go honky tonkin', honky tonkin'

06:39.680 --> 06:43.048
Honky tonkin', honey baby

06:43.200 --> 06:47.808
We'll go honky tonkin' 'round this town...

06:48.960 --> 06:51.060
How much you got there, Miss Lillie?

06:51.160 --> 06:53.481
I'm under no obligation to you.

06:54.360 --> 06:55.900
Well, that goes both ways, huh?

06:56.000 --> 07:00.020
Call me up, sweet mama
And we'll go steppin' out...

07:00.120 --> 07:02.521
He's drinking like a fish tonight.

07:03.160 --> 07:04.580
You think so?

07:04.680 --> 07:07.604
Honky tonkin', honey baby

07:08.280 --> 07:12.251
We'll go honky tonkin' 'round this town

07:37.720 --> 07:39.449
Thank y'all, folks.

07:40.240 --> 07:46.407
Now, I'm gonna invite up here
my precious wife, Audrey,

07:47.800 --> 07:48.980
Audrey, get up here.

07:49.080 --> 07:50.220
Don't worry, Lillie.

07:50.320 --> 07:52.482
Hank will hand it over to me
before we even get home.

07:54.240 --> 07:55.685
Get up here.

07:56.880 --> 07:58.260
She is a hell of a singer.

07:58.360 --> 07:59.930
Say hi, Audrey,

08:00.400 --> 08:01.481
Hi.

08:02.480 --> 08:03.561
Hi.

08:04.680 --> 08:08.730
Now we're gonna sing a little song here
called Blues Come Around.

08:09.080 --> 08:10.525
Boys, let's roll.

08:16.680 --> 08:19.300
Once I was happy as I could be

08:19.400 --> 08:21.926
But I let a man make a fool of me

08:22.080 --> 08:24.811
And ever since he let me down

08:24.920 --> 08:28.208
The blues come around
When the sun goes down

08:29.840 --> 08:31.980
As long as the sun is in the sky...

08:32.080 --> 08:33.780
Hey, Williams!

08:33.880 --> 08:35.620
You sound like a billy goat,
and so does she.

08:35.720 --> 08:36.960
Sit down!

08:38.120 --> 08:39.820
Sit down, you horse's ass.

08:39.919 --> 08:41.140
When the sun goes down

08:41.240 --> 08:42.659
Oh, the blues come around...

08:42.760 --> 08:44.444
You skinny little shit!

08:44.920 --> 08:48.260
When my wife wakes up,
she listens to you on the damn radio.

08:48.360 --> 08:51.330
If she's listening tomorrow morning,
I'm gonna beat the hell out of her.

08:56.640 --> 09:00.140
Well, partner, why don't you
just turn the damn thing off?

09:00.240 --> 09:01.730
That's why they put knobs on it.

09:02.960 --> 09:04.246
Wait, no!

09:06.520 --> 09:07.500
Get off him!

09:07.600 --> 09:09.090
- Get off!
- Get off!

09:10.240 --> 09:11.924
Get off! Get off!

09:15.360 --> 09:17.806
You need to control yourself, sir!

09:18.520 --> 09:19.500
Damn.

09:19.600 --> 09:20.660
Are you okay?

09:20.760 --> 09:21.700
I'm fine, I'm fine.

09:21.800 --> 09:22.881
I'm good.

09:41.720 --> 09:43.324
You are late.

09:52.160 --> 09:53.620
No, no, no.

09:53.720 --> 09:54.801
No.

09:59.160 --> 10:01.401
I know I birthed you, Hank.

10:02.440 --> 10:03.965
I was there.

10:05.560 --> 10:10.282
But where you came from
and how you got what you got

10:10.720 --> 10:13.260
and why you got it,

10:13.360 --> 10:15.681
I swear, nobody knows that.

10:16.880 --> 10:18.803
Except maybe the Lord.

10:19.160 --> 10:20.321
Maybe.

10:21.200 --> 10:23.601
She's gonna be pissed about this.

10:23.960 --> 10:25.405
You think I care?

10:25.520 --> 10:28.060
Shoot. I'm doing everybody
at the station a favor.

10:28.160 --> 10:30.980
That woman hasn't got a clue
who the star is around here.

10:31.080 --> 10:34.020
And I haven't been driving you
all over the state for 10 years,

10:34.120 --> 10:35.940
booking joints and schoolhouses,

10:36.040 --> 10:39.601
to see her swoop in
like she is the Queen of England.

10:40.040 --> 10:42.725
Know why you and Audrey don't get along?

10:46.720 --> 10:51.203
One of you is afraid the other's gonna
beat her to my pocket when I get drunk.

10:52.720 --> 10:54.820
That's a hurtful thing to say, son.

10:54.920 --> 10:57.446
Yeah, I'm just whupped, that's all.

10:59.720 --> 11:01.722
I wish that was all.

11:04.080 --> 11:05.844
When's the last time you ate?

11:06.840 --> 11:08.251
Can't recall.

11:10.680 --> 11:12.444
Is your back sore?

11:15.080 --> 11:16.570
It's fine.

11:20.880 --> 11:24.441
If you want to be sure you're getting
the tops in quality when you buy gas...

11:25.880 --> 11:27.020
Hi, Laura.

11:27.120 --> 11:28.406
Hey, Hank.

11:28.840 --> 11:31.100
- How you doing?
- Good. How are you?

11:31.200 --> 11:33.500
Now, you never write, you never call.

11:33.600 --> 11:35.762
- What'd I do?
- Look, Hank, I got to get these to the office.

11:35.880 --> 11:37.460
You got to go? Well, I'll see you soon.

11:37.560 --> 11:38.925
Bye, Hank.

11:39.400 --> 11:40.845
I'll miss you.

11:47.440 --> 11:48.620
Hi, boys.

11:48.720 --> 11:50.140
- Morning, boss.
- Howdy, Hank.

11:50.240 --> 11:51.241
How are y'all?

11:59.840 --> 12:01.683
I am moving slow today.

12:05.960 --> 12:07.849
Well, where's the missus?

12:08.960 --> 12:10.530
She ain't here.

12:13.160 --> 12:14.660
Williams!

12:14.760 --> 12:16.940
Where you get off
wasting 12 minutes of airtime?

12:17.040 --> 12:18.690
That shit ain't gonna work.

12:18.800 --> 12:20.380
And you smell like a damn still.

12:20.480 --> 12:21.980
All of ya.

12:22.080 --> 12:24.100
Why, I'm sorry, Mr. Pill.

12:24.200 --> 12:25.620
Yeah, well, that don't mean nothing to me.

12:25.720 --> 12:27.324
I'll boot you, I swear to God I will.

12:27.520 --> 12:30.000
We're running a business here, asshole.

12:31.240 --> 12:33.481
I surely know that, Mr. Pill.

12:36.680 --> 12:38.409
Count him off.

12:40.520 --> 12:42.682
Three, two, one.

12:43.920 --> 12:47.540
Hey, a fine, very early good morning
to all you friends out there.

12:47.640 --> 12:50.660
This is Hank Williams
and the Drifting Cowboys.

12:50.760 --> 12:53.020
We're awful sorry
we're getting a late jump,

12:53.120 --> 12:58.524
but last night, we got jumped ourselves
out on Highway 31.

13:00.000 --> 13:00.940
Yeah.

13:01.040 --> 13:02.849
There's one more thing.

13:03.760 --> 13:07.700
This looks like it's gonna be
our last program here at WSFA.

13:07.800 --> 13:11.940
So, if any of you out there have enjoyed it,
we'd sure like to hear from ya.

13:12.040 --> 13:13.963
You just write us and let us know.

13:14.960 --> 13:17.691
Hey, Lycrecia, don't you love this book?

13:17.920 --> 13:19.460
That's her cowboy.

13:19.560 --> 13:22.882
I dreamed about you, baby

13:23.360 --> 13:24.780
Even though...

13:24.880 --> 13:25.860
Bless you, honey.

13:25.960 --> 13:26.940
You let me go

13:27.040 --> 13:28.780
- Look at his hat.
- Honey, what you think?

13:28.880 --> 13:30.900
I'd like a hat like that.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.780
How long's it been
since Lycrecia saw her daddy?

13:33.880 --> 13:36.611
Well, he's gonna stop by next week
when she's at Mom and Dad's.

13:38.240 --> 13:43.531
Oh, my heart is oh so heavy

13:44.480 --> 13:46.740
And these tears

13:46.840 --> 13:48.220
No longer glow

13:48.320 --> 13:49.810
Come on. Eat-up time.

13:51.280 --> 13:54.700
I'm done dreaming

13:54.800 --> 13:57.644
About you, baby

13:58.600 --> 14:05.449
All because you let me go

14:08.840 --> 14:09.921
So?

14:12.760 --> 14:14.020
It's fine, baby.

14:14.120 --> 14:15.929
It's fine?

14:17.120 --> 14:18.620
Yeah. Fine.

14:18.720 --> 14:20.006
Well, how's the stew?

14:20.520 --> 14:21.726
It's fine.

14:23.680 --> 14:25.762
Everything's fine, then?

14:26.960 --> 14:28.291
Just fine.

14:30.800 --> 14:33.260
You know, if it's fine,
it doesn't need any ketchup.

14:33.360 --> 14:34.600
But it isn't that fine.

14:36.360 --> 14:37.885
The food or the song?

14:38.640 --> 14:42.042
Well, they both need
a little ketchup, honey.

14:44.400 --> 14:45.860
Screw you, Hank.

14:45.960 --> 14:47.860
- Come on, Auds.
- You come on.

14:47.960 --> 14:49.530
You always do this.

14:50.120 --> 14:51.087
Do what?

14:51.200 --> 14:52.804
Well, you know...

14:53.640 --> 14:55.500
Like you said that I could sing with you
on the program.

14:55.600 --> 14:57.340
And there's been none of that at all.

14:57.440 --> 14:58.601
Okay, fine.

14:59.240 --> 15:01.020
What's that mean?

15:01.120 --> 15:03.487
Geez, just what I said it means, okay?

15:15.320 --> 15:16.367
Hi.

15:17.800 --> 15:19.723
What are you writing, Hank?

15:21.120 --> 15:23.521
Maybe a little poem to the Lord.

15:24.160 --> 15:25.460
Might turn into a song.

15:25.560 --> 15:27.260
Can always use a new one.

15:27.360 --> 15:28.566
Really?

15:29.360 --> 15:31.522
Are you the religious sort?

15:33.280 --> 15:35.580
Well, when I was a boy,

15:35.680 --> 15:39.002
I spent a lot of time in church
listening to gospel.

15:39.640 --> 15:41.483
You still are a boy.

15:45.720 --> 15:47.290
You think so, Ellie?

15:48.400 --> 15:50.323
Why don't you write me a poem?

15:53.800 --> 15:55.131
Well...

15:57.680 --> 16:00.126
I might have to get
to know you a little better.

16:01.200 --> 16:02.804
Get lost, Ellie.

16:08.360 --> 16:09.900
Did you see Howard Pill called?

16:10.000 --> 16:12.082
Hank's got to come back.
He has a contract.

16:12.360 --> 16:14.044
That's true, we do.

16:14.560 --> 16:16.300
And it's a good job right now.

16:16.400 --> 16:18.780
He also said he'd like me
to do some singing on the show.

16:18.880 --> 16:20.530
That is not true.

16:20.800 --> 16:23.406
Geez, I was doing pretty good here.

16:28.600 --> 16:31.780
Few more shows,
I want to be done with him.

16:31.880 --> 16:33.900
It's not so easy to get out of.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.660
Well, he can do what he wants, Lillie.

16:35.760 --> 16:37.060
What is this, a schoolyard?

16:37.160 --> 16:38.140
Where are you going?

16:38.240 --> 16:40.980
Right now, I'm gonna take a piss.

16:41.080 --> 16:44.140
Then the day after tomorrow,
I'm going up to Nashville.

16:44.240 --> 16:46.980
Charlie Holt gave me the name of a guy
who can help me get on the Opry.

16:47.080 --> 16:49.140
Well, I pressed Charlie Holt.
You know that. I told you.

16:49.240 --> 16:50.820
You did. I know, yeah.

16:50.920 --> 16:52.922
That's just swell, Audrey.

16:53.440 --> 16:54.851
Sounds good?

16:55.520 --> 16:57.300
So, when are we going, baby?

16:57.400 --> 16:58.606
Friday.

16:59.440 --> 17:00.780
Friday?

17:00.880 --> 17:03.770
But Mama's bringing Lycrecia back then.

17:04.200 --> 17:05.964
So, there you go.

17:16.560 --> 17:18.339
- Hello, sir.
- Hey there.

17:18.440 --> 17:20.339
- I'm Hank Williams.
- I heard that.

17:20.440 --> 17:22.169
Well, I'll get down to it, then.

17:23.160 --> 17:24.940
Charlie Holt gave me your name.

17:25.040 --> 17:27.180
He said you'd tell me what I have to do
to get on the Opry.

17:27.280 --> 17:29.940
There's only one way to do that,
and that's to audition for Jack Stapp.

17:30.040 --> 17:33.408
Well, I... You know, I sure hate
those auditions, Mr. Collins.

17:33.880 --> 17:35.120
Maybe I could just meet him.

17:35.240 --> 17:37.004
Son, there are no shortcuts to the Opry.

17:39.920 --> 17:41.809
Well, could you tell Mr. Stapp
that I'm here?

17:42.520 --> 17:44.170
Hank, how old are you?

17:45.560 --> 17:47.700
Twenty... Twenty-three
when I last checked, sir.

17:47.800 --> 17:51.220
Well, that's old enough that you
ought to know that's not how it works.

17:51.320 --> 17:53.766
Now, you're gonna make an appointment,

17:54.160 --> 17:58.100
and then you'll play for him, and if he
likes it, you'll play for Judge Hay.

17:58.200 --> 17:59.565
And then what?

18:00.320 --> 18:02.060
And then Judge Hay's likely to tell you
to come back

18:02.160 --> 18:03.321
when you're hot enough to draw flies.

18:04.840 --> 18:07.002
Well, I just might know how to do that.

18:07.840 --> 18:09.808
Hank, you know Fred Rose?

18:12.320 --> 18:13.970
I know of him.

18:14.120 --> 18:15.660
Roy Acuff's partner.

18:15.760 --> 18:17.340
Among other things.

18:17.440 --> 18:19.966
You might want to know of him
a little bit better.

18:20.240 --> 18:23.180
When he first came to see me,
he played some songs he'd written

18:23.280 --> 18:24.850
and some other folks' material.

18:25.280 --> 18:29.842
Well, actually, I believe Audrey, his wife,
had been calling here quite a bit,

18:29.960 --> 18:31.883
pushing me to see him.

18:32.360 --> 18:37.127
And I offered him a contract
right then and there as a songwriter.

18:37.440 --> 18:38.900
Damn publishing deal.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.180
Ten dollars per song, plus royalties.

18:41.280 --> 18:43.521
Officially a paid songwriter.

18:43.640 --> 18:47.725
So I suggest you address me
as Mr. Hiram Williams from now on.

18:49.120 --> 18:51.100
Where the hell'd Hiram come from anyway?

18:51.200 --> 18:52.940
From my old man.

18:53.040 --> 18:55.580
Got it from King Hiram
of the Book of Kings.

18:55.680 --> 18:57.780
Hiram the First of Tyre.

18:57.880 --> 18:59.340
Can we get some strawberries later?

18:59.440 --> 19:03.729
Lillie never mentions your daddy at all,
you know, like he never existed.

19:04.400 --> 19:07.460
Yeah, she put him in
the Veterans Hospital when I was six.

19:07.560 --> 19:09.847
The one down in Pensacola.

19:09.960 --> 19:13.900
I don't know, it was a...
A war injury from France or something.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.620
But a cousin told me
it was from a truck accident

19:16.720 --> 19:19.200
in a lumberyard he was working in.

19:19.760 --> 19:22.570
Anyway, he was all messed up, and...

19:23.920 --> 19:25.604
That was about it for us.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.002
Night-night, little bastard.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.480
Better watch where you put that thing.

19:54.960 --> 19:56.220
Howdy.

19:56.320 --> 19:57.401
Hi.

20:10.240 --> 20:13.084
I think we might have
a little bronco riding tonight.

20:13.920 --> 20:14.980
Says who?

20:15.080 --> 20:16.650
Says ol' Hank.

20:17.520 --> 20:18.980
Well, I look forward to that event.

20:19.080 --> 20:20.491
You should.

20:20.720 --> 20:23.405
Especially since you're not drinking.

20:24.840 --> 20:27.571
Now, darling, that's uncalled for.

20:31.080 --> 20:32.525
You're right.

20:34.320 --> 20:38.370
Well, then come on and climb up, cowboy.

20:40.480 --> 20:41.845
My back.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.685
- It's gone again, baby.
- All right, then.

20:53.800 --> 20:55.211
You love me?

20:57.680 --> 20:59.170
You love me?

20:59.680 --> 21:03.127
Do you really love me, honey?

21:06.160 --> 21:07.844
Most of the time I do.

21:11.720 --> 21:14.620
Came in last night at a half past 10:00

21:14.720 --> 21:17.500
That baby of mine wouldn't let me in

21:17.600 --> 21:19.300
So move it on over

21:19.400 --> 21:21.100
Move it on over

21:21.200 --> 21:23.580
- Move it on over
- Move it on over

21:23.680 --> 21:27.730
Move over, little dog
'Cause the big dog's moving in

21:29.680 --> 21:32.660
She changed the lock on our front door

21:32.760 --> 21:35.460
And my door key don't fit no more

21:35.560 --> 21:37.580
So get it on over

21:37.680 --> 21:40.100
- Move it on over
- Scoot it on over

21:40.200 --> 21:41.460
Move it on over

21:41.560 --> 21:45.360
Move over, skinny dog
'Cause the fat dog's moving in...

21:47.320 --> 21:49.660
Now, why don't you come down here,
and you'll see what I'm talking about.

21:49.760 --> 21:51.091
Come down.

21:51.600 --> 21:54.460
Now, you see that the left
is much higher than the right.

21:54.560 --> 21:55.980
- Can you see it now?
- Sure, yeah. Yeah.

21:56.080 --> 21:58.020
Now, good.
Now, why don't you go back up and fix it?

21:58.120 --> 21:59.180
Yes, ma'am.

21:59.280 --> 22:00.770
And watch your head.

22:00.880 --> 22:02.723
I don't need no blood.

22:22.440 --> 22:23.820
Hey, honey, get in here.

22:23.920 --> 22:25.100
What?

22:25.200 --> 22:26.700
I want to show you something.

22:26.800 --> 22:28.300
What is it?

22:28.400 --> 22:30.846
Well, get in here, and I'll show you.

22:31.920 --> 22:33.604
Well, okay, then.

22:33.920 --> 22:36.207
What do you have to show me?

22:37.840 --> 22:39.444
You see this?

22:40.400 --> 22:41.606
Now...

22:43.520 --> 22:48.447
"Where the inspiration for Move It On Over
came from, Hank couldn't say.

22:49.360 --> 22:51.980
"It surely wasn't his own married life.

22:52.080 --> 22:56.140
"Mr. and Mrs. Hank Williams
lead a model domestic life."

22:56.240 --> 22:57.740
Wait, you think that's funny?

22:57.840 --> 22:59.842
I kind of do. Don't you?

23:03.560 --> 23:06.020
Also says we've sold over 90,000.

23:06.120 --> 23:07.167
My God.

23:07.280 --> 23:11.290
If that's even half true, I wonder
what kind of money that really adds up to.

23:11.720 --> 23:14.540
Adds up to Hiram Williams
is a big damn deal.

23:14.640 --> 23:18.531
Well, big deal, did you see
that note on the counter?

23:19.240 --> 23:22.460
Howard Pill called, making sure
we're at the station tomorrow.

23:22.560 --> 23:25.723
Hell with that show.
I should have never gone back.

23:29.640 --> 23:30.860
All right, folks.

23:30.960 --> 23:32.700
I know it's 6:30 in the morning,

23:32.800 --> 23:35.580
but say you're milking a cow
or just going to the store

23:35.680 --> 23:39.660
for some extra feed or supplies,
we sure appreciate you listening to us.

23:39.760 --> 23:41.140
We really do.

23:41.240 --> 23:44.860
Now, I got a young lady
gonna sing a song for you.

23:44.960 --> 23:46.900
- You here?
- I'm here.

23:47.000 --> 23:48.660
I'm up in here.

23:48.760 --> 23:51.580
She's slowly approaching the microscope.

23:51.680 --> 23:53.045
You good?

23:53.160 --> 23:54.260
I'm fine.

23:54.360 --> 23:55.964
Hey, you don't sound like you mean it.

23:56.080 --> 23:58.048
- Well, I do.
- Well, good.

23:58.160 --> 23:59.820
Now, she's gonna sing a little ol' song

23:59.920 --> 24:02.020
called Pan American,
which some of you will know.

24:02.120 --> 24:07.020
It's the locomotive that highballs it
from Cincinnati all the way to New Orleans

24:07.120 --> 24:08.804
just about every day.

24:09.400 --> 24:11.641
At least turn her mic down,
for God's sake.

24:11.760 --> 24:13.420
Set your clock by it.

24:13.520 --> 24:15.045
All right, Byrd.

24:26.560 --> 24:31.327
I have heard your stories
About your fast trains

24:31.800 --> 24:34.340
And now I'll tell you about one

24:34.440 --> 24:36.900
All the Southern folks have seen

24:37.000 --> 24:39.660
She's the beauty of the Southland

24:39.760 --> 24:42.570
Listen to that whistle scream

24:43.120 --> 24:48.570
It's that Pan American
On her way to New Orleans...

24:53.400 --> 24:54.700
Well, we got through that.

24:54.800 --> 24:55.926
Barely.

24:57.280 --> 24:59.860
Someone's got to do something about her.

24:59.960 --> 25:01.041
Well, well, well.

25:02.000 --> 25:05.004
You boys discussing the weather or Audrey?

25:05.760 --> 25:10.084
Well, Hank, actually
we were discussing her singing.

25:10.440 --> 25:11.540
You were?

25:11.640 --> 25:12.766
Yeah.

25:14.440 --> 25:16.408
Well, Hank,

25:18.560 --> 25:19.780
she's awful.

25:19.880 --> 25:21.660
Hey, you son of a bitch, that's my wife.

25:21.760 --> 25:23.580
Well, now, look, Hank,
you know as well as I do.

25:23.680 --> 25:24.940
- Now, come on.
- Well, maybe I do,

25:25.040 --> 25:26.020
but that don't matter right now.

25:26.120 --> 25:27.963
That's my wife you're talking about.

25:32.960 --> 25:35.167
Well, screw you, my husband.

25:37.480 --> 25:38.940
Hey, darling. Darling, you didn't hear

25:39.040 --> 25:40.740
what I was saying back there.
I was defending you.

25:40.840 --> 25:42.490
You did a hell of a job on that song.

25:42.600 --> 25:43.860
- Just forget about it.
- Baby.

25:43.960 --> 25:45.220
Baby, it's a beautiful morning.

25:45.320 --> 25:46.580
You look beautiful.

25:46.680 --> 25:47.740
We're doing really swell.

25:47.840 --> 25:49.540
Have another drink, Hank.

25:49.640 --> 25:50.620
We're doing shit.

25:50.720 --> 25:51.900
Why'd you got to say that?

25:52.000 --> 25:53.161
You know people like my singing?

25:53.280 --> 25:54.940
They tell me that. But not you.

25:55.040 --> 25:57.500
Every time you get a chance,
you squash me like a bug.

25:57.600 --> 25:59.220
What are you talking about, a bug?

25:59.320 --> 26:00.580
More like a damn queen bee.

26:00.680 --> 26:02.660
I bring you up there.
I stand by your side.

26:02.760 --> 26:04.500
- Yeah, holding your nose!
- Holding my nose? No.

26:04.600 --> 26:06.780
Yeah, I'm sick of feeling bad,
Hank, I'm sick of it!

26:06.880 --> 26:09.020
Hey, we've got a hit record,
in case you don't know.

26:09.120 --> 26:11.220
We got a new house, and you got
a goddamned fur coat.

26:11.320 --> 26:14.220
You think that makes up for all the
drunken whoring around bullshit I take?

26:14.320 --> 26:17.244
- It ought to make up for something!
- Well, it don't!

26:17.760 --> 26:20.620
Not for a second does it make up
for crushing a person's dreams.

26:20.720 --> 26:21.860
What?

26:21.960 --> 26:25.851
Yeah, I'll tell you what,
'cause it's clear as hell right now.

26:26.320 --> 26:29.860
You can take your hit record,
wrap it up in that fur coat

26:29.960 --> 26:32.531
and you answer the phone
when my lawyer calls.

26:36.360 --> 26:37.521
Great.

26:38.000 --> 26:40.321
He can call right fucking now!

27:27.880 --> 27:29.689
"Love each other."

27:42.760 --> 27:47.129
"Hank, I'm opening my heart to you
because I love you like my own son.

27:51.640 --> 27:54.610
"You and Audrey,
you surely love each other.

27:55.040 --> 27:57.611
"But you both want to be the boss.

27:58.560 --> 28:00.528
"Both of you have your pride.

28:00.880 --> 28:04.487
"Pride is one of the most
destructive lies on Earth."

28:41.960 --> 28:43.940
Say, how do I look?

28:44.040 --> 28:47.169
Better than you did
when you came in, Mr. Williams.

28:48.880 --> 28:50.380
Thank you, Miss Warwick.

28:50.480 --> 28:52.420
I ain't coming in again.

28:52.520 --> 28:54.124
I'm pleased to hear that.

29:03.280 --> 29:05.780
- Don. How are ya?
- Pretty good.

29:05.880 --> 29:08.060
- What, you brought me some candy?
- Yeah.

29:08.160 --> 29:09.161
Thank you.

29:11.680 --> 29:13.364
My darling valentine not with you?

29:18.040 --> 29:19.121
Well.

29:22.400 --> 29:24.448
Winner and still champion.

29:35.200 --> 29:39.340
"This day in April, 1948,
my husband, Hank Williams

29:39.440 --> 29:42.683
"has a violent and ungovernable temper.

29:45.520 --> 29:48.620
"He drinks a great deal,
and during the last month,

29:48.720 --> 29:51.121
"he's been drunk most of the time.

29:51.360 --> 29:55.180
"The past few months, he's been engaging
in the wildest extravagances

29:55.280 --> 29:58.124
"and wasting the funds
which come into his hands."

29:58.960 --> 30:00.900
I've been wasting the funds.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.480
Audrey ran up a hell of a tab
at Lowry's Furniture.

30:03.720 --> 30:06.540
The owner says he wants it all
by the end of this week.

30:06.640 --> 30:07.880
Does he now?

30:09.040 --> 30:14.171
Well, you can tell that guy that
every month I put all my bills in a hat

30:15.640 --> 30:18.940
and then I draw one out
and that's the one I pay.

30:19.040 --> 30:21.008
And if he presses me up again

30:21.680 --> 30:24.180
I ain't even gonna put
his damn bill in the hat.

30:24.280 --> 30:25.327
All right.

30:25.760 --> 30:28.820
The house is a push, essentially,
but you're out from under it.

30:28.920 --> 30:31.820
And, well, here's the deposit.

30:31.920 --> 30:33.922
$2,250, in cash.

30:34.920 --> 30:38.208
It's all just a bunch of papers,
some green and some bloody.

30:40.720 --> 30:45.020
I don't see what the problem is
or why it's taking so long or maybe...

30:45.120 --> 30:47.600
You talkin' to that divorcing bitch?

30:50.080 --> 30:52.128
Look, it's the Opry, Fred.

30:52.680 --> 30:54.489
That's what I want.

30:54.960 --> 30:56.620
I always wanted it.

30:56.720 --> 30:59.660
Yeah, I get it, I get it.
But it's not in the cards.

30:59.760 --> 31:03.380
Okay, I'm talking to those boys down there,
but we're gonna have to prove ourselves.

31:03.480 --> 31:06.300
And not just musically, frankly,
but with reliability,

31:06.400 --> 31:08.020
Well, the hell with them then.

31:08.120 --> 31:10.860
They can go screw themselves
if they think they're better 'n me.

31:10.960 --> 31:13.220
That's right. They can kiss your ass.

31:13.320 --> 31:14.560
I'm not the enemy, Hank.

31:14.680 --> 31:19.084
Now, I got things just about set up with
the Hayride down at Shreveport on KWKH.

31:21.440 --> 31:23.408
- Okay.
- Okay?

31:24.280 --> 31:25.860
Yeah, for the time being, yeah.

31:25.960 --> 31:27.200
All right, good.

31:27.320 --> 31:28.924
How's the family? How's Audrey?

31:29.720 --> 31:31.700
- She's just fine.
- Good.

31:31.800 --> 31:33.940
She's a demon, that's what she is.

31:34.040 --> 31:36.327
Women can be vengeful
when they're not on your side.

31:37.120 --> 31:40.060
Don't you worry, Fred. She's on my side.

31:40.160 --> 31:42.367
She's on her own damn side.

31:42.640 --> 31:44.642
We'll get to Nashville, son.

32:16.120 --> 32:19.488
- Crecia, why don't you come back inside?
- Okay, Mommy.

32:20.200 --> 32:21.850
I'll be in in a sec.

32:29.680 --> 32:30.681
Audrey.

32:31.320 --> 32:32.401
Hank.

32:36.800 --> 32:39.485
I'm goin' to Shreveport for the Hayride.

32:42.800 --> 32:44.325
I want you to come with me.

32:46.200 --> 32:47.929
Did you get the papers?

32:48.560 --> 32:49.641
Yep.

32:50.680 --> 32:52.728
You get the house money?

33:02.560 --> 33:04.244
Come on, Auds.

33:04.520 --> 33:06.522
You're always, "Come on."

33:07.400 --> 33:10.370
We're about divorced,
in case you didn't know.

33:12.680 --> 33:14.660
It's too hard, this divorce thing.

33:14.760 --> 33:17.445
Well, you should've thought about that
a long time ago.

33:19.600 --> 33:21.648
Yeah, I probably should have.

33:23.280 --> 33:25.248
I couldn't see that far.

33:27.440 --> 33:29.249
I couldn't see that

33:31.160 --> 33:33.322
fighting with you
was better than being apart.

33:33.680 --> 33:36.251
People do divorce all the time.

33:36.920 --> 33:38.524
Trust me, you can do it.

33:41.440 --> 33:42.646
I know.

33:48.160 --> 33:49.241
But,

33:51.280 --> 33:54.170
I married the right woman
for a man like me,

33:56.600 --> 33:58.648
and I ain't ready to say goodbye.

33:59.200 --> 34:01.202
I don't exactly know what that means.

34:02.480 --> 34:05.131
I need you with me, is what it means.

34:09.520 --> 34:13.764
Besides, don't I look good?

34:18.239 --> 34:19.810
You look okay.

34:20.199 --> 34:21.610
I look okay.

34:24.639 --> 34:25.880
Is Lillie goin'?

34:31.080 --> 34:34.050
You think you could treat me right, then?

34:34.360 --> 34:35.850
Quit drinkin'?

34:38.920 --> 34:40.001
Yes, I do.

34:41.480 --> 34:42.969
But you can't.

34:45.520 --> 34:47.123
I can try.

34:48.800 --> 34:50.609
Come with me, Audrey.

34:52.159 --> 34:53.810
I'm afraid to.

34:56.840 --> 34:58.205
I love you.

34:59.880 --> 35:01.006
Yeah.

35:14.000 --> 35:16.401
You gonna quit fighting me
about singing together?

35:18.120 --> 35:21.010
Well, yeah. Yes, I am.

35:28.800 --> 35:30.211
You mean it.

35:32.720 --> 35:34.051
I mean it.

36:57.120 --> 36:58.201
Hey.

37:00.960 --> 37:02.405
Mornin', darlin'.

37:07.400 --> 37:09.084
How'd the road go?

37:09.920 --> 37:11.126
You all right?

37:11.600 --> 37:13.284
I'm pretty beat.

37:13.600 --> 37:15.364
I'm sorry I woke you.

37:15.560 --> 37:16.925
You didn't.

37:17.200 --> 37:19.726
I haven't been sleeping worth a damn.

37:22.480 --> 37:23.860
I know about that.

37:23.960 --> 37:25.325
Nah, I haven't.

37:40.840 --> 37:41.966
Hank.

37:47.760 --> 37:49.285
You listening?

37:52.520 --> 37:53.681
Kinda.

37:54.520 --> 37:56.522
I'm driftin' off, though.

37:57.040 --> 37:59.520
Well, I was gonna tell you somethin'.

38:05.600 --> 38:07.170
You hearing me?

38:22.040 --> 38:24.008
You're gonna be a daddy.

38:35.720 --> 38:37.085
Audrey Mae.

38:43.160 --> 38:45.925
My God. We're gonna have a baby?

38:49.240 --> 38:50.844
- Really?
- Really.

38:57.840 --> 38:59.220
I can't tell.

38:59.320 --> 39:00.970
Well, you will.

39:04.080 --> 39:06.765
- Audrey, I love you.
- And I love you.

39:13.760 --> 39:15.489
This is gonna be great.

39:17.200 --> 39:19.441
It's gonna be great!

39:20.320 --> 39:22.700
You know, he's gonna have a real dad.

39:22.800 --> 39:23.860
Yeah.

39:23.960 --> 39:26.611
No, not like I had.
Not like it was for me.

39:27.480 --> 39:28.766
He's gonna have family.

39:29.520 --> 39:31.380
Well, how do you know it's a boy?

39:31.480 --> 39:35.724
Well, whatever it is,
he's gonna have a real family.

39:39.760 --> 39:41.967
Fred wants me to head up Cincinnati
for a session.

39:42.120 --> 39:43.380
Yeah, when?

39:43.480 --> 39:44.540
Next week.

39:44.640 --> 39:45.926
I'm good.

39:49.360 --> 39:50.885
Look, thing is,

39:52.640 --> 39:56.380
Fred wants me to try out some other boys
to back me up on this one.

39:56.480 --> 39:58.642
What the hell... What'd you tell the man?

40:00.200 --> 40:01.440
His call.

40:02.720 --> 40:04.420
I don't like that much.

40:04.520 --> 40:08.286
Well, I didn't figure you would,
but, that's the way it's gotta be.

40:08.840 --> 40:10.968
Well, maybe you don't need us at all.

40:11.520 --> 40:12.500
Look, it don't mean nothin'.

40:12.600 --> 40:16.490
It's just that Red Foley's band's already up
there and Fred wants a record right away.

40:16.600 --> 40:18.011
I see. It don't mean nothin'.

40:18.160 --> 40:19.900
I don't need any shit, Shag.

40:20.000 --> 40:21.490
Well, me neither.

40:28.000 --> 40:29.700
What's he got in mind?

40:29.800 --> 40:31.580
I wanna try Lovesick.

40:31.680 --> 40:34.340
He ain't gonna like that.
You didn't even write it.

40:34.440 --> 40:35.851
Well, that's true.

40:38.000 --> 40:39.684
But I made it mine now.

40:39.880 --> 40:41.769
All righty right.

40:42.200 --> 40:45.380
Hey, Fred. We did a couple for you.
I got one for me.

40:45.480 --> 40:48.051
I wanna do Lovesick. Right, boys?

40:50.240 --> 40:52.100
Well, hell, screw you guys.

40:52.200 --> 40:56.300
Hank, that song is painful,
and not in the right way.

40:56.400 --> 40:57.526
It's out of meter.

40:57.640 --> 41:00.246
You hang onto some of those notes
too damn long.

41:00.600 --> 41:03.285
Well, when I find a note I like,
I like holdin' on to it.

41:03.640 --> 41:06.211
Listen to me. I'm on the Hayride.

41:06.560 --> 41:11.487
I sing that song, I walk off the stage,
I throw my hat back on the stage.

41:12.040 --> 41:13.460
The hat gets an encore.

41:13.560 --> 41:15.005
Come on, now.

41:16.800 --> 41:19.406
All right. I'm getting a cup of coffee.
You got 15 minutes.

41:19.680 --> 41:21.020
Thank you, sir.

41:21.120 --> 41:23.580
All right, boys, Lovesick Blues.
Let's keep it simple.

41:23.680 --> 41:26.126
No need to worry, Hank.
Isn't all this shit simple?

41:37.760 --> 41:41.481
I got a feeling called the blues, oh Lord

41:41.600 --> 41:43.762
Since my baby said goodbye

41:45.320 --> 41:48.244
Lord, I don't know what I'll do

41:48.920 --> 41:51.540
All I do is sit and sigh...

41:51.640 --> 41:52.820
I'll tell you somethin'.

41:52.920 --> 41:53.967
I ain't buyin'.

41:56.720 --> 41:59.100
Gonna have a burger there
with the ketchup?

41:59.200 --> 42:00.406
Yes, I am.

42:01.880 --> 42:03.848
- Hey, Sammy, you get there yet?
- No.

42:04.120 --> 42:05.531
I didn't start from the back.

42:05.760 --> 42:09.020
Well, I guess in high school
you still read front to back, huh?

42:09.120 --> 42:10.420
That's funny, Hank.

42:10.520 --> 42:12.020
You ain't that much older, you know.

42:12.120 --> 42:14.327
I was born older than you, Sammy.

42:19.800 --> 42:21.529
Take a look at this.

42:22.640 --> 42:23.971
Look at it.

42:41.160 --> 42:43.561
Now, I'll tell you somethin'.

42:43.920 --> 42:45.540
And this ain't bull.

42:45.640 --> 42:47.961
If this don't get me to the Opry,

42:50.400 --> 42:52.243
I'm gonna give it up.

42:52.560 --> 42:53.721
No shit.

42:53.840 --> 42:56.940
They'll have to come find me on a boat
full of bass and come beggin'!

42:57.040 --> 42:58.020
What they'll have to do.

42:58.120 --> 42:59.121
- Hank.
- Oscar!

42:59.480 --> 43:01.460
What, somebody been chasing you or what?

43:01.560 --> 43:02.660
It's Audrey.

43:02.760 --> 43:05.331
- She all right?
- Yeah, yeah. You comin'?

43:05.680 --> 43:09.605
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Well, okay then! All right!

43:09.880 --> 43:11.140
Hey, I told you I ain't buyin'.

43:11.240 --> 43:14.244
Hey, Sammy, keep a hold
of that magazine, okay?

43:36.920 --> 43:39.321
Doc. Everything all right?

43:39.880 --> 43:41.300
Congratulations.

43:41.400 --> 43:43.100
You have a son, Mr. Williams.

43:43.200 --> 43:45.380
- I... I do?
- You do.

43:45.480 --> 43:48.300
- How's Mama?
- She's good. She's strong.

43:48.400 --> 43:49.460
- She all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

43:49.560 --> 43:51.740
- And the boy, well, he's healthy, and...
- Yeah?

43:51.840 --> 43:52.780
Big.

43:52.880 --> 43:54.700
- He's big?
- Over 10 pounds.

43:54.800 --> 43:56.211
- Well...
- Biggest this year.

43:56.320 --> 43:57.420
He's a hoss, huh?

43:57.520 --> 43:58.646
That's the truth.

43:59.560 --> 44:01.130
Well, thank you, Doc. Thank you so much.

44:01.240 --> 44:02.460
- Absolutely.
- Thank you.

44:02.560 --> 44:04.420
We'll have her ready for you
to see in about 15 minutes.

44:04.520 --> 44:05.500
- Yes, sir. All right.
- All right.

44:05.600 --> 44:07.780
- I'm gonna need my hand back.
- Okay, all right, I'll let you go.

44:07.880 --> 44:09.644
- All right. Sure.
- Okay. Thank you, sir.

44:18.680 --> 44:20.250
All right, now.

44:21.160 --> 44:24.448
Daddy's here. Daddy's here.

44:25.720 --> 44:28.007
It's all right. It's all right.

44:36.480 --> 44:38.340
It's all right.

44:38.440 --> 44:39.965
Daddy's here.

44:41.160 --> 44:46.963
I wouldn't let my dear savior in

44:48.960 --> 44:51.620
Then Jesus came

44:51.720 --> 44:55.167
Like a stranger in the night

44:56.400 --> 44:59.500
Praise the Lord

44:59.600 --> 45:01.967
I saw the light

45:02.600 --> 45:09.051
I saw the light

45:09.720 --> 45:12.690
No more darkness

45:13.120 --> 45:16.124
No more night

45:16.920 --> 45:20.129
Now I'm so happy

45:20.440 --> 45:23.410
No sorrow in sight

45:25.000 --> 45:28.180
Praise the Lord

45:28.280 --> 45:30.965
I saw the light

45:37.120 --> 45:40.124
He was sleeping pretty good there
for a few days.

45:41.320 --> 45:44.130
I guess they finally put the batteries in.

45:48.960 --> 45:51.122
He sure likes his mama.

46:04.800 --> 46:06.882
I'm going to the Opry, Auds.

46:07.840 --> 46:09.842
Of course you are, honey.

46:12.840 --> 46:14.444
I mean now.

46:36.080 --> 46:39.448
Well, how'd he get past
Jack Stapp and that gang?

46:41.360 --> 46:44.409
Oscar and Fred swore
I'd keep my nose clean.

46:45.040 --> 46:46.580
I've been sober.

46:46.680 --> 46:48.603
Well, I ought to be there.

46:50.480 --> 46:52.562
I ought to be there, Hank.

46:54.080 --> 46:55.889
But I can't, can I?

46:57.360 --> 46:59.408
This peanut's too little.

47:02.880 --> 47:04.420
It's not right.

47:04.520 --> 47:06.443
I know. I know, honey.

47:07.560 --> 47:08.846
I know.

47:09.360 --> 47:10.691
I'm sorry.

47:11.560 --> 47:14.211
It suddenly just happened that fast?

47:16.520 --> 47:18.761
Not fast enough for me.

47:20.000 --> 47:24.085
I'm walking the floor over you

47:25.600 --> 47:29.525
I can't sleep a wink, that is true

47:30.000 --> 47:32.340
I'm hoping and I'm praying

47:32.440 --> 47:34.408
As my heart breaks right in two...

47:36.480 --> 47:37.606
Hank.

47:38.680 --> 47:39.761
How you doing, son?

47:40.240 --> 47:42.100
- Pretty fair.
- Don't worry,

47:42.200 --> 47:43.884
they can kill you, but they can't eat you.

47:45.160 --> 47:46.969
Strangely comforting.

47:47.280 --> 47:48.740
I'm real proud of you, Hank.

47:48.840 --> 47:50.604
I say that as a friend.

47:50.720 --> 47:53.140
- Well, I wouldn't be here without you, Pappy.
- Well.

47:53.240 --> 47:55.020
It's everything I ever wanted.

47:55.120 --> 47:59.020
Well, soon as he's done, there's gonna
be three commercials, and then it's you.

47:59.120 --> 48:01.140
Foley's boys are backing you.

48:01.240 --> 48:02.969
They're down the hall.

48:03.680 --> 48:05.420
- Jim.
- Fred.

48:05.520 --> 48:07.860
Hank, Jim Denny, manager of the Opry.

48:07.960 --> 48:09.962
Yes, sir. Thank you.

48:10.520 --> 48:12.329
Sure. Good luck.

48:18.920 --> 48:21.651
...just food and drinks and everything.

48:22.840 --> 48:24.365
- You guys get a little hungry...
- Boys.

48:25.200 --> 48:26.540
- Hey, Hank.
- Hey.

48:26.640 --> 48:27.721
Hank.

48:30.800 --> 48:31.847
Hank.

48:33.720 --> 48:34.881
Jerry.

48:38.720 --> 48:42.220
Ladies and gentlemen, tonight's big-name
guest is making his first appearance

48:42.320 --> 48:44.180
on the Prince Albert Grand Ole Opry.

48:44.280 --> 48:47.540
Let's give a rousing welcome
to the Lovesick Blues boy,

48:47.640 --> 48:49.290
Mr. Hank Williams!

48:56.200 --> 48:58.780
I got a feelin' called the blues

48:58.880 --> 49:01.884
Oh, Lord, since my baby said goodbye

49:03.040 --> 49:06.123
Lord, I don't know what I'll do

49:06.440 --> 49:09.780
All I do is sit and sigh, oh Lord

49:09.880 --> 49:13.646
That last long day she said goodbye

49:14.120 --> 49:17.363
Well, Lord, I thought I would cry

49:18.080 --> 49:21.540
She'll do me, she'll do you
She's got that kind of lovin'

49:21.640 --> 49:23.700
Lord, I love to hear her when she calls me

49:23.800 --> 49:26.700
Sweet daddy

49:26.800 --> 49:28.962
Such a beautiful dream

49:30.080 --> 49:32.845
I hate to think it all over

49:33.040 --> 49:36.601
I lost my heart, it seems

49:36.800 --> 49:40.361
I've grown so used to you somehow

49:40.760 --> 49:44.300
Well, I'm nobody's sugar daddy now

49:44.400 --> 49:46.620
And I'm lonesome

49:46.720 --> 49:48.722
I got the lovesick blues

49:51.160 --> 49:52.940
Well, I'm in love, I'm in love

49:53.040 --> 49:54.929
With a beautiful gal

49:55.360 --> 49:57.727
That's what's the matter with me

49:57.960 --> 49:59.820
Well, I'm in love, I'm in love

49:59.920 --> 50:01.780
With a beautiful gal

50:01.880 --> 50:03.962
But she don't care about me

50:04.920 --> 50:07.180
Lord, I've tried and I've tried

50:07.280 --> 50:08.660
To keep her satisfied

50:08.760 --> 50:11.684
But she just wouldn't stay

50:12.080 --> 50:15.607
So now that she is leavin'

50:15.920 --> 50:19.500
This is all I can say

50:19.600 --> 50:23.060
I got a feelin' called the blues, oh Lord

50:23.160 --> 50:25.527
Since my baby said good-bye

50:26.720 --> 50:29.690
Lord, I don't know what I'll do

50:30.240 --> 50:33.340
I lost my heart, it seems

50:33.440 --> 50:37.604
I've grown so used to you somehow

50:37.720 --> 50:41.100
Well, I'm nobody's sugar daddy now

50:41.200 --> 50:43.620
And I'm lonesome

50:43.720 --> 50:47.566
I got the lovesick blues

51:13.880 --> 51:17.260
Glen Burnie, Maryland, where local law
enforcement and the Air Force have turned up

51:17.360 --> 51:22.011
some unusual evidence, which may shed light
on the recent flying saucer sightings.

51:22.520 --> 51:24.443
Baseball's greatest manager, Connie Mack,

51:24.560 --> 51:27.580
was given a massive
ticker tape parade on Broadway,

51:27.680 --> 51:29.125
Fifty years of managing!

51:31.720 --> 51:34.740
And Grand Ole Opry performers
Roy Acuff, Minnie Pearl

51:34.840 --> 51:37.620
and young heartthrob, Hank Williams,
have been on a tour

51:37.720 --> 51:39.449
of US airbases in Germany,

51:41.000 --> 51:43.900
Here's Hank and his wife, Audrey,
moving into a new house

51:44.000 --> 51:46.844
on Franklin Road in Nashville, Tennessee.

51:48.200 --> 51:50.123
Good luck, young lovers!

52:12.280 --> 52:13.566
Merry Christmas, Fred.

53:07.840 --> 53:10.180
Jesus, Hank, I've been looking for you.

53:10.280 --> 53:11.740
What are you doing out here?

53:11.840 --> 53:13.763
I love this thing. I love it.

53:14.600 --> 53:17.140
- Come over here, push my button.
- No, you're crazy.

53:17.240 --> 53:18.860
I'm gonna go back inside.

53:18.960 --> 53:20.689
All right, well,
bring me a drink, will ya?

53:20.800 --> 53:22.340
Well, no, you don't need one.

53:22.440 --> 53:24.602
Now, can you come back inside
before you get sick?

53:25.520 --> 53:27.363
This is inspirational.

53:27.800 --> 53:30.740
She builds me up, she brings me down...

53:30.840 --> 53:33.660
Baby, I'm so thrilled
that you're inspired now.

53:33.760 --> 53:35.620
Now, could you please
come back in and join the party?

53:35.720 --> 53:36.940
Hey, honey?

53:37.040 --> 53:38.620
Did you like that necklace I got you?

53:38.720 --> 53:40.660
- Yeah, I love it.
- Do ya?

53:40.760 --> 53:41.860
Yeah.

53:41.960 --> 53:43.940
Well, come over here and push my button.

53:44.040 --> 53:46.088
No way. It's freezing, baby.

53:46.200 --> 53:48.540
- Forget it, then!
- What, so now you're gonna be mad?

53:48.640 --> 53:50.620
- No, I'm not mad.
- Okay, well, good,

53:50.720 --> 53:52.500
'cause I'm gonna go back inside,
and you, you just...

53:52.600 --> 53:54.540
You keep on playing
with that button of yours.

53:54.640 --> 53:57.965
- Well, good, 'cause I love my button.
- Well, then you keep on lovin' it!

54:03.320 --> 54:09.123
You'll meet many just like me
Upon life's busy street...

54:10.680 --> 54:11.920
Yeah.

54:12.680 --> 54:15.980
Yeah, Luke the Drifter was a pseudonym

54:16.080 --> 54:19.180
that Hank sometimes used
to record certain songs.

54:19.280 --> 54:23.602
They didn't sell well, but they seemed
to offer some emotional relief for Hank.

54:24.120 --> 54:26.980
Hank's first record for us
was Move It On Over.

54:27.080 --> 54:30.580
And then in our second session,
he recorded I Saw the Light.

54:30.680 --> 54:33.060
And Audrey Williams,
did you work with her?

54:33.160 --> 54:35.049
How should I say this?

54:35.440 --> 54:39.809
We were happy to have
Decca release her material.

54:39.920 --> 54:41.365
Miss Ragland!

54:42.240 --> 54:44.208
Could you take the child?

55:07.640 --> 55:09.620
- Operator.
- Hi, Operator.

55:09.720 --> 55:12.041
Sheraton Hotel, Oklahoma City, please.

55:12.400 --> 55:14.860
Well, I had me a woman

55:14.960 --> 55:17.406
Who done me wrong

55:18.400 --> 55:20.300
I wish I had the words

55:20.400 --> 55:23.722
To fix this song...

55:34.680 --> 55:36.444
Sorry, ma'am, still no answer.

55:36.560 --> 55:37.740
Care to leave a message?

55:37.840 --> 55:41.100
Yes. Could you tell him,

55:41.200 --> 55:44.602
"I need to talk to you,
you son of a bitch"?

55:47.480 --> 55:49.900
- Did you get that?
- Yes, ma'am.

55:50.000 --> 55:51.081
Good.

56:42.000 --> 56:43.525
No, thanks.

57:30.000 --> 57:31.889
Afternoon, Mr. Nowlin.

57:32.160 --> 57:34.100
This ain't gonna cut it, fellas.

57:34.200 --> 57:36.180
Yes, sir. I'm real sorry. I understand.

57:36.280 --> 57:38.700
I... You see, Hank's come down
with something real bad,

57:38.800 --> 57:43.727
and, well, he's just too damn sick
to perform up to our usual standards.

57:44.600 --> 57:46.940
I don't know what's up with you, Williams,

57:47.040 --> 57:51.020
but you're going up on that stage,
and you're gonna give these folks,

57:51.120 --> 57:55.648
who've been waiting hours for your ass,
a fine piece of yourself.

57:56.400 --> 57:58.050
You understand?

57:59.000 --> 58:00.604
Thank you, sir.

58:01.240 --> 58:02.924
That the doctor?

58:03.400 --> 58:06.768
Or whatever he is
that does these kinds of things.

58:08.080 --> 58:09.889
Well, come on in.

58:10.760 --> 58:12.808
Let's get this over with.

58:14.760 --> 58:16.842
I don't want to wait a whole lot longer.

58:25.760 --> 58:27.922
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have an announcement.

58:28.480 --> 58:29.970
Hank Williams is here!

58:33.000 --> 58:36.180
And he is ready to give you the show
you've been hoping for.

58:36.280 --> 58:38.248
Hank Williams, everyone!

58:54.000 --> 58:55.809
Come on, Hank!

59:02.440 --> 59:05.330
Any ofyou folks know
my half-brother, Luke?

59:07.160 --> 59:09.162
My good friend, Luke the Drifter?

59:11.760 --> 59:13.620
Hell, I don't know
where they got the Luke part,

59:13.720 --> 59:17.486
but I can sure tell ya
where they got the Drifter part.

59:23.640 --> 59:25.881
I'd like to tell you a story

59:28.600 --> 59:30.807
About a family I once knew

59:33.000 --> 59:36.891
Why don't we call 'em William and Mary

59:37.680 --> 59:39.967
and their little daughter Sue.

59:42.320 --> 59:46.120
Now, Mary was just a plain mother,

59:47.000 --> 59:49.685
and Bill, well, he was a usual dad.

59:51.840 --> 59:55.020
And they had
their own little family quarrels,

59:55.120 --> 59:58.249
but neither one ever really got mad.

59:59.240 --> 01:00:03.131
And then one day something happened.

01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:07.201
And it was nothing, of course.

01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:14.882
But one word led to another,
and the last word led to a divorce.

01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:24.484
Now, here were two grown-up people
who'd failed to use common sense.

01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:30.762
They strengthened their own selfish pride

01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:35.641
at little Sue's expense.

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:47.850
...eight, nine, 10, 11, 12...

01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:51.083
They sold me 13 roses.

01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:54.928
You know, we'll save one for Hazel.

01:00:57.080 --> 01:00:58.620
Thanks for doing all the driving, Don.

01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:01.200
Sure. You want me to stick around?

01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:03.090
Nah, you're fine.

01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:07.608
Hank, I've been thinking.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:10.740
We've been running pretty hard.

01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:14.481
Maybe I've been too reluctant
to speak up about some things.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.380
You've been fine.

01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:18.925
Whatcha gonna do?

01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:22.410
You know,

01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:25.602
my uncle told me

01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:29.126
Grant was drunk

01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:32.371
every afternoon by 3:00.

01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:36.881
But he still took Vicksburg.

01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:40.282
Yeah, I guess he did.

01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:47.340
I'll see ya, then.

01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:48.965
I'll see ya.

01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:07.846
Hey.

01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:10.644
How long you been here?

01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:13.370
A little bit.

01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:16.208
It took you long enough.

01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:21.162
I just got off the road.

01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:27.404
- How are you?
- How'd you do?

01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:30.369
We made out okay.

01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:32.844
How's my boy?

01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:34.611
He's okay.

01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:36.060
How much?

01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:37.460
Where's he at?

01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:40.404
He's at the house. Where you think?

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.129
Billboard says we did
$11,000 paid last week.

01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:50.011
I heard you and Luke
had some trouble in Texas.

01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:55.887
Yeah.

01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:07.524
What is it, baby?

01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:11.340
You gonna be okay?

01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:13.488
Am I gonna be okay?

01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:17.766
Hell.

01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:24.201
You know, you come home
from God knows wherever you are,

01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:27.964
and then we sleep together.

01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:37.763
You haven't a damn clue.

01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:42.202
You did this to me, Hank.

01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:49.849
You're the bastard
that caused me to suffer like this.

01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:52.930
What are you saying?

01:03:57.600 --> 01:03:59.921
God, you're barely even here.

01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:04.887
You're barely even a father now.

01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:09.329
And, well,

01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:13.603
you couldn't have handled
being more of one.

01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:21.284
What did you do?

01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:26.980
You can't... You can't do that without me.

01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:28.809
Well, it's done.

01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:56.260
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you very much.

01:04:56.360 --> 01:04:57.860
Thank you, friends.

01:04:57.960 --> 01:05:00.088
And that about wraps it up for today,

01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:06.060
All right, all right,
there a little more in store, isn't there?

01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:10.540
I almost forgot about the man
y'all come to say hello to and rightly honor.

01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:12.961
He's my very very good friend.

01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:16.922
One of the finest songwriters
I've ever had the pleasure to know

01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:21.300
So, let's welcome,
at his Montgomery Homecoming Day,

01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:24.643
a great and loyal son of Alabama,

01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:26.685
Hank Williams!

01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:54.245
Hank Williams!

01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:04.725
Hey, buddy.

01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:19.730
Well, hello, Montgomery.

01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:26.180
It's always good to be back here.

01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:27.805
I thank y'all so much.

01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:29.140
I thank you.

01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:33.020
I much appreciate the warm welcome
you've given to me and my family,

01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:34.451
My mother, Lillie.

01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:39.128
My beautiful wife, Audrey,

01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:43.370
My little lady, Lycrecia.

01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:48.288
My big boy, Bocephus!

01:06:57.680 --> 01:07:00.540
Now, right now,
I got a little song for ya.

01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:02.620
It's been awful good to me and the boys.

01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:05.220
It's bought us quite
a few beans and biscuits.

01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:06.500
It's called

01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:09.604
Good Looking, You Got Anything Cooking,
How About Cooking It Up With Me?

01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:21.411
Hey, good lookin'

01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:24.646
Whatcha got cookin'?

01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:29.842
How's about cookin' something up with me?

01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:34.124
Said, hey, sweet baby

01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:37.127
Don't you think maybe

01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:42.805
We could find us a brand-new recipe?

01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:47.220
I got a hot-rod Ford and a two-dollar bill

01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:50.369
And I know a spot right over the hill

01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:52.980
There's soda pop and the dancing's free

01:07:53.080 --> 01:07:56.260
So if you wanna have fun
Come along with me

01:07:56.360 --> 01:07:59.330
Said, hey, good lookin'

01:08:00.040 --> 01:08:02.486
Whatcha got cookin'?

01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:07.563
How's about cookin' something up with me?

01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:09.525
Don Helms.

01:08:21.359 --> 01:08:24.330
I'm free and I'm ready

01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:27.524
So we can go steady

01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:32.801
How's about savin' all your time for me?

01:08:39.479 --> 01:08:41.340
You think all hotels are good.

01:08:41.439 --> 01:08:42.566
Yeah.

01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:46.125
Here we are.

01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:48.260
Where are you gentlemen going?

01:08:48.359 --> 01:08:49.964
Perry Como Show.

01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:52.979
Thank you, sir.

01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:54.241
Thank you.

01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:02.620
- It was a good show, man.
- It was.

01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:05.460
You sure couldn't get
that damn jingle right, could you?

01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:07.859
Don't you know there's 20 smokes
in a pack of Chesterfields?

01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:11.180
I know damn well there's 20 smokes
in a pack of Chesterfields.

01:09:11.279 --> 01:09:12.939
And I'll tell you something else.

01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:15.805
Ol' Hank didn't come all the way
from South Alabama to New York City

01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:19.447
to sing in a damn cigarette commercial,
that's for damn sure.

01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:22.100
Gentlemen want another round,
or have you hit your limit

01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:24.300
- on soda water?
- Yes, ma'am! We do.

01:09:24.399 --> 01:09:25.925
Yeah, I'm good.

01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:27.819
Have a damn drink, boys.

01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:29.859
Babysittin' hour's about up.

01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:31.140
Thank you.

01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:32.580
Yes, please, ma'am.

01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:34.100
Mr. Williams.

01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:35.779
James Dolan from the Tribune.

01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:37.484
Really sorry I'm late.

01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:41.451
You don't like doing this much, do you?

01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:45.127
Well, it comes with the job.

01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:51.242
You know what I don't like

01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:56.088
is people pretending one thing
and they got something else on their mind.

01:09:56.440 --> 01:09:59.967
You do what I do, you get where I am,
you see plenty of that.

01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:05.401
People thinking they'll make a nice pie
with a slice of me.

01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:09.810
Well, I'm only looking to give people
some insight into you.

01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:13.443
Why you write what you write,
sing what you sing.

01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:18.971
I write what I write and I sing what I sing
'cause that's what I do.

01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:22.122
Ain't much choice, really.

01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:24.300
As an artist.

01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:26.084
That's your word.

01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:33.140
You are offering your fans something.

01:10:33.240 --> 01:10:35.322
What would you say that is?

01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:49.844
Mr. Dolan,

01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:54.128
everybody has a little darkness in them.

01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:57.460
Now, they may not like it,

01:10:57.560 --> 01:11:00.100
don't want to know about it,

01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:02.089
but it's there.

01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:06.529
Now, I'm talking about things like anger,

01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:10.681
misery, sorrow, shame.

01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:14.768
And they hear it.

01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:17.129
I show it to 'em.

01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:20.768
And they don't have to take it home.

01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:36.330
You think that's
what they expect from you?

01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:43.371
They expect I can help their troubles.

01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:47.248
Now, the reason I know that
is 'cause they write.

01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:53.007
If their husband dies and they're left
with eight starving kids, they write.

01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:56.683
If their sweetheart's done 'em wrong,
they write.

01:11:56.880 --> 01:11:59.140
I don't know,

01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:02.528
but I reckon they think
I'm some sort of Red Cross.

01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:08.324
You can write this down.

01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:13.049
Folk music, hillbilly,

01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:15.210
it's sincere.

01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:18.607
There ain't nothing phony.

01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:22.620
Man sings a sad song,

01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:24.290
he knows the sad.

01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:31.090
There's, well, a lot of speculation

01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:36.820
about the hard lives
that western or folk singers live.

01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:38.922
What do you mean, "hard"?

01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:42.340
Well, I mean,
more like the women, whiskey.

01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:45.603
If you're getting at something,
then get at it.

01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:49.966
There are a lot of rumors, Mr. Williams,

01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:53.447
that you have struggled with alcohol.

01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:57.180
I didn't know you were
in the rumor business, Mr. Dolan.

01:12:57.280 --> 01:12:58.740
I'm not. I don't mean to offend...

01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:02.500
But since you obviously are,
why don't you say they're all true,

01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:04.489
- every single one of 'em?
- Because that's not what I do.

01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:07.964
You can do whatever you want to do,

01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:10.562
but I'm done doing this.

01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:44.820
Hunt 'em up, now. Hunt 'em up.
There you go, Zeke.

01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:46.285
Hunt 'em up.

01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:49.900
Here we go. Hunt 'em up.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:51.331
Hunt 'em up.

01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:53.766
Sit.

01:13:54.920 --> 01:13:56.843
- Try gettin' birdy.
- Sit.

01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:04.220
- God blessed!
- Birdy.

01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:05.810
- Damn it!
- You're supposed to shoot 'em,

01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:07.540
- not scare 'em off.
- Yeah, I'm trying.

01:14:07.640 --> 01:14:09.085
Whoa, Zeke.

01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:11.884
He's onto something.

01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:20.660
Shit.

01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:22.171
It's a coon.

01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:26.206
Hank?

01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:28.326
Hey, Hank!

01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:29.846
Oh, God.

01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:35.486
What are you doing down there, man?

01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:37.890
- Here.
- No...

01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:39.963
Give me a second, Burr.

01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:43.764
My back is fucked.

01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:50.245
Mr. Williams?

01:14:56.560 --> 01:14:58.403
Your back's not broken.

01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:02.740
Well, I couldn't feel it if it was.

01:15:02.840 --> 01:15:06.242
Yes, you've got quite a bit
of morphine in your system.

01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:10.681
Have to get the recipe from ya.

01:15:12.120 --> 01:15:14.964
How much do you know about your condition?

01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:18.763
Always had that bump.

01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:23.884
Docs early on didn't want to
do much about it.

01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:25.820
Well, there's a name for that.

01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:27.843
It's called spina bifida occulta.

01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:31.123
It means your vertebrae
aren't completely closed.

01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:35.060
Now, people with the mildest form
of this type of spina bifida

01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:36.764
often don't even know they have it.

01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:44.287
Well, now I know it's got a name.

01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:46.940
It's chronic, Mr. Williams.

01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:48.371
It'll never go away.

01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:50.180
Now, we can operate,

01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:53.489
try and alleviate the pain
as much as possible.

01:15:57.080 --> 01:15:59.048
Cure me or kill me, Doc.

01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:04.528
I can't go on like
I've been doing anymore.

01:16:24.240 --> 01:16:25.446
Hey.

01:16:28.520 --> 01:16:30.170
How you doing?

01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:36.611
I suppose you've been out
with your friends?

01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:41.740
At a joint?

01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:43.330
No, I was at a house.

01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:45.440
Drinking?

01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:48.165
Yeah, a little bit.

01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:55.768
Exactly how sick would I have to be

01:16:55.880 --> 01:16:58.531
for you to stick around
and provide a little comfort?

01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:06.651
Well, a little comfort
is something that runs two ways.

01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:11.660
Not in your case.

01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:12.921
Damn.

01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:15.884
Screw you, Hank.

01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:18.660
Come over here and you can.

01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:20.171
Yeah, I doubt that.

01:17:20.760 --> 01:17:24.207
Professional like you,
I'm sure it'd be no problem.

01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:28.971
You son of a bitch.

01:17:29.080 --> 01:17:30.820
All you do is you go out on the road

01:17:30.920 --> 01:17:33.380
and you sleep with
a different woman every night,

01:17:33.480 --> 01:17:36.380
and then you finally get home
and criticize me?

01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:38.881
Well, you want it all, don't you, baby?

01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:43.445
You want to whore around
and still be Mrs. Hank Williams.

01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:47.130
You know what?

01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:50.887
You can keep your great
Mrs. Hank Williams.

01:17:51.640 --> 01:17:53.642
I'll give it back to you.

01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:03.500
Baby, what are you doing up?

01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:05.489
Come here. Let's get you back to bed.

01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:18.180
I know I can't make D.C.
or Baltimore, Jim.

01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:21.220
Now, why can't we just
tell them the truth and live with it?

01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:23.380
I'm sorry, Hank,
but I think we got to do it this way.

01:18:23.480 --> 01:18:25.540
You're not hearing me.
I don't want to do it!

01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:28.380
And I sure as hell don't want
Audrey standing in for me,

01:18:28.480 --> 01:18:30.380
- or anybody else at the show.
- Hank,

01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:32.340
I don't see a way around it.

01:18:32.440 --> 01:18:33.965
It's simple.

01:18:34.480 --> 01:18:37.609
I can't make it 'cause I'm laid up.

01:18:37.960 --> 01:18:40.340
Now, I get the boys as soon as I can.

01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:42.660
I go down there on my own money.

01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:44.020
I'll make it right.

01:18:44.120 --> 01:18:46.740
Connie Gay is putting these shows on.

01:18:46.840 --> 01:18:48.380
Now, he and I go back forever.

01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:50.180
Now, there's nobody else available.

01:18:50.280 --> 01:18:52.740
I mean, I got the Opry spread
all over on New Year's Eve.

01:18:52.840 --> 01:18:54.922
Toledo, Baltimore, Raleigh.

01:19:00.360 --> 01:19:02.522
Says one every three hours.

01:19:05.400 --> 01:19:09.962
I figure three every hour
ought to be that much better.

01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:19.290
You good to go?

01:19:20.080 --> 01:19:21.844
- Hell.
- Yes, sir.

01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:23.900
Look,

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:27.163
you don't show, everybody will think
it's the whiskey talking,

01:19:27.280 --> 01:19:29.460
and Connie Gay will be stuck bad.

01:19:29.560 --> 01:19:32.620
And whether you like it or not,
I represent the Opry.

01:19:32.720 --> 01:19:34.180
And as fond of you as I am,

01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:36.620
if you want to stay a part of this,
you got to do it.

01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:38.740
You need to record this.

01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:40.763
We'll play it that night.

01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:43.565
You always been a son of a bitch, J.D.

01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:47.324
Well, that may be,
but it's 'cause I have to be.

01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:50.407
But I always been solid by you.

01:20:05.520 --> 01:20:07.010
Give me a pen.

01:20:09.240 --> 01:20:12.050
I think I can write my own damn apology.

01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:19.285
I'd really been looking forward to
visiting you folks in Washington today,

01:20:20.240 --> 01:20:23.620
But, well, a couple weeks ago, I...

01:20:23.720 --> 01:20:26.564
I had to have an operation on my back.

01:20:27.160 --> 01:20:30.562
Fact is, I been in bed a couple weeks,

01:20:32.480 --> 01:20:37.884
and, well, I sure am sorry
I couldn't be there tonight.

01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:41.809
I hope y'all enjoy the rest of the show

01:20:43.120 --> 01:20:47.125
And thanks for buying my records.

01:20:49.840 --> 01:20:52.220
Audrey, I should've gone straight home.

01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:56.860
No, it's fine. We'll just have a drink,
and they will just have to deal with it.

01:20:56.960 --> 01:20:58.220
If you say so.

01:20:58.320 --> 01:20:59.446
Yeah.

01:21:04.120 --> 01:21:05.246
Hank?

01:21:08.240 --> 01:21:09.401
Hank?

01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:14.967
Why don't you two wait in here,
and I'll go see where he is.

01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:19.700
Hank?

01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:21.962
Doesn't appear
anyone's here to greet Mommy.

01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:24.201
Yeah.

01:21:26.960 --> 01:21:29.020
Where the hell is he?

01:21:29.120 --> 01:21:30.326
What is he doing?

01:21:47.520 --> 01:21:49.841
What the hell are you doing?

01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:55.940
Killing bottles, waiting for
my loving wife to come home.

01:21:56.040 --> 01:21:57.690
Okay, well, I'm home now.

01:21:58.960 --> 01:22:00.166
Chri...

01:22:02.440 --> 01:22:03.601
Hi, ladies.

01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:05.580
Hello, Hank.

01:22:05.680 --> 01:22:07.220
What are you... Are you drunk?

01:22:07.320 --> 01:22:08.606
Are you?

01:22:09.960 --> 01:22:13.928
Do you think that you could wait till
we're alone before you start acting up?

01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:18.540
You really have no couth, do you?

01:22:18.640 --> 01:22:19.740
You son of a bitch.

01:22:19.840 --> 01:22:21.251
I suppose you're right, dear.

01:22:23.240 --> 01:22:27.245
Now die, you God-awful tiki wiki shit!

01:22:44.200 --> 01:22:46.202
Hank Williams,

01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:50.567
I will never live another day with you.

01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:53.440
Never.

01:23:03.640 --> 01:23:06.300
That's when he moved in with Ray Price.

01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:10.300
Ray was a bit younger,
and innocent in many ways,

01:23:10.400 --> 01:23:14.610
and he really looked up to Hank,
as a lot of the guys did.

01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:20.446
And the house was a nice place
in the Natchez Trace area in Nashville.

01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:29.283
One thing's for sure.

01:23:29.720 --> 01:23:32.610
Ray wasn't ready
for what Hank was bringing.

01:24:19.560 --> 01:24:22.300
Hank, can you believe
I was gonna be a veterinarian?

01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:23.580
- Hey, Ray?
- Look at me now.

01:24:23.680 --> 01:24:25.340
I got the best party on the block.

01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:27.500
- Look at you now!
- I should write a song

01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:29.500
- called Look At Me Now
- You should write...

01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:32.922
Look at me now..

01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:36.731
"His conduct was intolerable.

01:24:37.200 --> 01:24:40.204
"He became abusive, cursing me,

01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:43.530
"and even striking me
on numerous occasions."

01:24:43.640 --> 01:24:45.780
- That's a damn lie, Ray.
- I'm sure it is.

01:24:45.880 --> 01:24:48.020
Why'd she have to go that far?

01:24:48.120 --> 01:24:50.860
Well, Hank, that's divorce
in this country, as far as I can tell.

01:24:50.960 --> 01:24:53.580
This says I made 92 grand last year.

01:24:53.680 --> 01:24:55.460
Hell, I didn't make that.

01:24:55.560 --> 01:24:58.723
House at 55 grand, three Cadillacs.

01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:04.740
"In the past months,
defendant has been enjoying

01:25:04.840 --> 01:25:07.491
"a life of wild extravagance."

01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:10.689
Hey, Bobbie, come here.

01:25:11.160 --> 01:25:12.571
Come on, get a seat.

01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:25.960
I'm rich.

01:25:27.280 --> 01:25:28.964
And I'm dangerous.

01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:37.566
Well, I guess there's worse things
you could be.

01:25:38.840 --> 01:25:40.900
Says that I had an affair
with a highway patrolman

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:42.843
when he was on the road.

01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:45.940
And look at this.

01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:48.060
I insisted on singing with him

01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:51.528
when I had neither a voice
or musical ability.

01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:55.369
How you doing up there, cowboy?

01:25:56.920 --> 01:25:59.651
Just can't believe this place is yours.

01:26:00.800 --> 01:26:02.689
For about another hour.

01:26:03.560 --> 01:26:05.820
Was gonna build a house
over by that pecan grove,

01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:07.922
but that ain't happening now.

01:26:08.520 --> 01:26:11.444
Well, you'll get another one
somewhere else.

01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:14.724
Somewhere else.

01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:17.820
I've been there before.

01:26:17.920 --> 01:26:19.604
And it ain't much better.

01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:26.767
You know, sometimes I wish
I was back at WSFA making $12 a week,

01:26:27.240 --> 01:26:29.686
and knowing who my friends were.

01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:51.340
- Hey, you know this man?
- By telephone only. He's okay.

01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:53.761
I bet he's never heard one song.

01:26:58.800 --> 01:27:00.700
You gentlemen may go in now.

01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:03.406
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Thank you, ma'am.

01:27:04.800 --> 01:27:05.900
Fred!

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:07.300
Sorry to keep you waiting.

01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:08.700
- Welcome, welcome.
- How are you, Dore?

01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:10.325
I'm fine, Fred, you know.

01:27:11.640 --> 01:27:13.290
Hank, how are you?

01:27:16.200 --> 01:27:17.850
I'm all right, Mr. Schary.

01:27:17.960 --> 01:27:19.220
I'm all right.

01:27:19.320 --> 01:27:20.460
Well, take your hat off.

01:27:20.560 --> 01:27:22.528
Sit down. Just relax.

01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:27.940
How was the flight in?

01:27:28.040 --> 01:27:29.565
It was all right.

01:27:29.680 --> 01:27:31.700
A little bumpy over Wichita.

01:27:31.800 --> 01:27:32.860
Yeah?

01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:34.485
Yeah, always is.

01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:40.020
Hank, I'm very sorry to hear about

01:27:40.120 --> 01:27:42.900
you and Audrey having troubles,
I mean, you know.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.651
The business, it's tough on marriage.

01:27:45.960 --> 01:27:48.884
Well, marriage is tough on marriage.

01:27:50.800 --> 01:27:52.450
- Yep.
- Yeah.

01:27:54.560 --> 01:27:55.686
Yeah.

01:27:58.760 --> 01:28:00.740
What do you say we just cut to the chase?

01:28:00.840 --> 01:28:02.100
All right.

01:28:02.200 --> 01:28:04.620
I saw your press release
announcing our deals.

01:28:04.720 --> 01:28:05.860
You fellas played it up nicely.

01:28:05.960 --> 01:28:08.645
We were generally pleased
with the response.

01:28:12.200 --> 01:28:16.683
Well, we're thinking of a part
for Hank in Small Town Girls,

01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:18.740
with Farley Granger and Jane Powell.

01:28:18.840 --> 01:28:20.660
My wife loves Jane Powell.

01:28:20.760 --> 01:28:22.171
Perfect.

01:28:22.520 --> 01:28:24.180
So does America.

01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:25.406
Yeah.

01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:30.620
And as we discussed, Fred,
it would be no more than four weeks' work.

01:28:30.720 --> 01:28:31.660
Right.

01:28:31.760 --> 01:28:34.525
And a salary of $4,500 a week.

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.082
That's quite a lot of money, isn't it?

01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:41.850
Well, it's not as much cash
as I can make on the road.

01:28:42.040 --> 01:28:43.610
Is it, Pappy?

01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:47.820
Well, I'm sure between Fred and I,

01:28:47.920 --> 01:28:51.811
we can come to an arrangement,
if we're all serious.

01:28:52.320 --> 01:28:53.685
So, Hank, how tall are you?

01:28:55.160 --> 01:28:57.128
About the same as my mother.

01:29:00.080 --> 01:29:01.980
Six feet, six-one, thereabout.

01:29:02.080 --> 01:29:04.780
Is that with or without the hat?

01:29:04.880 --> 01:29:06.803
Because I don't think
I've ever seen you without it.

01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:08.761
Well, me neither.

01:29:11.720 --> 01:29:13.404
Would you mind?

01:29:15.320 --> 01:29:17.368
I'd like to see, well,

01:29:18.120 --> 01:29:19.849
your general look.

01:29:20.800 --> 01:29:22.245
Your hair.

01:29:22.960 --> 01:29:24.530
You do have hair, right?

01:29:25.240 --> 01:29:26.571
Yes, sir.

01:29:27.960 --> 01:29:30.611
I got a whole drawer full of it.

01:29:31.640 --> 01:29:33.290
I'm serious, Hank.

01:29:34.360 --> 01:29:35.805
Me, too.

01:29:43.760 --> 01:29:45.569
You know, I read something today.

01:29:45.840 --> 01:29:47.410
It said I was a genius.

01:29:49.600 --> 01:29:52.365
Why do you figure that makes me fearful?

01:29:53.840 --> 01:29:55.808
Probably the load.

01:29:56.400 --> 01:29:58.323
I miss them so much, Mama.

01:29:58.680 --> 01:29:59.966
So damn much.

01:30:00.080 --> 01:30:01.380
I know you do.

01:30:01.480 --> 01:30:02.891
- I know.
- Ladies and gentlemen,

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:04.900
let me just give you the lowdown
on this next fella's...

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.401
But you are better off without her, son.

01:30:08.320 --> 01:30:10.482
She was never worth a half of you.

01:30:12.080 --> 01:30:14.220
I got a little boy I worry about, too.

01:30:14.320 --> 01:30:16.402
...he's got a new song out there
that he wrote for us.

01:30:31.520 --> 01:30:32.580
Yes, sir.

01:30:32.680 --> 01:30:34.500
I got a brand-new song,
ain't never been aired.

01:30:34.600 --> 01:30:36.540
Ain't never been aired?

01:30:36.640 --> 01:30:38.210
No, but it just might need it.

01:30:38.720 --> 01:30:39.926
Doggone it, Hank!

01:30:40.240 --> 01:30:41.730
All right, boys, let it roll.

01:30:47.320 --> 01:30:51.020
Well, why don't you love me
like you used to do?

01:30:51.120 --> 01:30:54.020
How come you treat me
like a worn-out shoe?

01:30:54.120 --> 01:30:57.380
My hair's still curly
and my eyes are still blue

01:30:57.480 --> 01:31:00.529
Why don't you love me like you used to do?

01:31:00.640 --> 01:31:03.620
I ain't had no lovin'
like a-huggin' and a-kissin'

01:31:03.720 --> 01:31:07.100
In a long, long while

01:31:07.200 --> 01:31:10.340
We don't get nearer or further

01:31:10.440 --> 01:31:13.728
Or closer than a country mile

01:31:14.840 --> 01:31:17.900
Why don't you spark me
like you used to do?

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:21.260
And say sweet nothings
like you used to coo

01:31:21.360 --> 01:31:23.140
I'm the same old trouble

01:31:23.240 --> 01:31:24.820
That you've always been through

01:31:24.920 --> 01:31:28.180
Why don't you love me like you used to do?

01:31:28.280 --> 01:31:29.327
Don Helms.

01:31:40.920 --> 01:31:42.046
Burt Hale.

01:32:10.600 --> 01:32:14.340
Well, why don't you be
just like you used to be?

01:32:14.440 --> 01:32:17.820
How come you find so many faults with me?

01:32:17.920 --> 01:32:21.340
Somebody's changed
so let me give you a clue

01:32:21.440 --> 01:32:24.020
Why don't you love me like you used to do?

01:32:24.120 --> 01:32:25.660
I ain't had no lovin'

01:32:25.760 --> 01:32:30.561
Like a-huggin' and a-kissin'
in a long, long while

01:32:32.960 --> 01:32:33.900
I just laughed it off.

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:35.411
I don't know.

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:38.161
Hey, girl.

01:32:41.720 --> 01:32:42.860
You here with anybody?

01:32:42.960 --> 01:32:43.961
Faron Young.

01:32:44.480 --> 01:32:46.220
Boy guesting up in Shreveport?

01:32:46.320 --> 01:32:47.401
That's him.

01:32:48.320 --> 01:32:50.971
And that's him right over there
behind you.

01:32:52.120 --> 01:32:53.060
Hey, Faron.

01:32:53.160 --> 01:32:54.140
Hank.

01:32:54.240 --> 01:32:56.163
- Good to meet you.
- Good to meet you.

01:32:56.840 --> 01:32:58.001
Billie?

01:32:58.800 --> 01:33:00.006
You gonna marry this girl?

01:33:01.600 --> 01:33:02.780
Well, are you?

01:33:02.880 --> 01:33:04.450
Well, not likely.

01:33:05.240 --> 01:33:07.242
She's far too good-looking for a wife.

01:33:08.080 --> 01:33:10.162
Well, if you ain't gonna marry her,

01:33:11.680 --> 01:33:13.330
ol' Hank just might.

01:33:13.840 --> 01:33:15.604
- Is that right?
- That's right.

01:33:17.200 --> 01:33:18.300
Son.

01:33:18.400 --> 01:33:20.402
I hope I ain't causing you any pain.

01:33:21.240 --> 01:33:22.844
Don't worry about it.

01:33:29.400 --> 01:33:31.084
You're like an angel.

01:33:33.440 --> 01:33:34.700
My two boys over there,

01:33:34.800 --> 01:33:37.167
Alton and Sonny, big fans of yours.

01:33:38.040 --> 01:33:39.220
Pregnant at 16.

01:33:39.320 --> 01:33:40.820
So, Jeri Lynn there.

01:33:40.920 --> 01:33:42.809
Married and pregnant, Mr. Jones.

01:33:43.240 --> 01:33:45.300
Well, I'm not selling her short.

01:33:45.400 --> 01:33:46.731
She is pretty tough.

01:33:47.720 --> 01:33:48.980
I bet she is.

01:33:49.080 --> 01:33:51.740
Nineteen years old,
what the hell do you know?

01:33:51.840 --> 01:33:53.620
Yeah, I could barely tie
my own shoes then.

01:33:53.720 --> 01:33:55.609
Well, heck, I wasn't even wearin' them.

01:33:57.400 --> 01:33:59.050
I like children a lot.

01:33:59.360 --> 01:34:01.020
I got one of my own,

01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:02.884
and my former wife had one, too.

01:34:03.600 --> 01:34:06.580
Well, you're handsome,
talented and love kids.

01:34:06.680 --> 01:34:08.045
How about that, Daddy?

01:34:08.840 --> 01:34:10.888
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:34:22.960 --> 01:34:24.564
- Hey, Ray.
- Hank.

01:34:27.280 --> 01:34:28.281
Bobbie.

01:34:28.680 --> 01:34:29.727
Hank.

01:34:33.560 --> 01:34:34.561
You with him?

01:34:35.040 --> 01:34:36.121
Nope.

01:34:36.680 --> 01:34:37.700
You with him?

01:34:37.800 --> 01:34:39.540
Bobbie, what are you doing here?

01:34:39.640 --> 01:34:40.820
What do you think, Hank?

01:34:40.920 --> 01:34:42.660
- That's nice.
- Thank you.

01:34:42.760 --> 01:34:44.540
Billie, let me handle this, please.

01:34:44.640 --> 01:34:45.980
Bobbie, we got to talk.

01:34:46.080 --> 01:34:47.081
Talk?

01:34:47.640 --> 01:34:48.846
Get her out of here.

01:34:49.200 --> 01:34:50.770
I'm sorry, darling.

01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:52.930
But who do you think you are?

01:34:53.320 --> 01:34:54.820
Well, I was the woman he was gonna marry.

01:34:54.920 --> 01:34:56.380
- Really? Lucky him.
- Billie.

01:34:56.480 --> 01:34:58.660
Maybe you should have told some
of your other girls that, Hank.

01:34:58.760 --> 01:35:00.762
- Bobbie.
- Well, you are right about that, honey.

01:35:00.880 --> 01:35:01.881
Bobbie.

01:35:02.160 --> 01:35:03.340
Billie. Billie!

01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:04.441
Billie!

01:35:05.040 --> 01:35:07.020
Billie, there isn't anybody else,
I swear to God!

01:35:07.120 --> 01:35:08.531
She got it wrong about us, okay?

01:35:08.640 --> 01:35:09.820
They get it that way sometimes.

01:35:09.920 --> 01:35:12.321
"They"?

01:35:13.800 --> 01:35:16.644
Boy, you're a real piece of work,
Hank Williams.

01:35:17.120 --> 01:35:19.282
You know, I may just be
a Bossier City kid,

01:35:19.400 --> 01:35:21.380
but I got enough sense
to know you're trouble,

01:35:21.480 --> 01:35:22.891
and you're gonna tear me up.

01:35:24.880 --> 01:35:25.961
Billie.

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.002
Billie!

01:35:31.200 --> 01:35:34.380
We're gonna have a big ol' time
at the Grand Ole Opry tonight!

01:35:34.480 --> 01:35:36.700
That's right. We got quite a lineup.

01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:39.804
We've got Bob Mayfield,
we've got Minnie Pearl,

01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:42.287
and Hank Williams!

01:35:44.040 --> 01:35:45.860
So, let's put our hands together.

01:35:45.960 --> 01:35:48.804
Let's do a live
and lively rousing welcome.

01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:00.681
Hank?

01:36:06.440 --> 01:36:07.487
Hank.

01:36:10.800 --> 01:36:12.529
Hey, Jim.

01:36:12.840 --> 01:36:13.841
Hank.

01:36:17.920 --> 01:36:20.020
You want something? Cup of coffee?

01:36:20.120 --> 01:36:21.167
No, thanks.

01:36:22.560 --> 01:36:23.766
Where's Ray?

01:36:24.680 --> 01:36:25.886
He moved out.

01:36:29.320 --> 01:36:31.940
I don't want to know where you were
or why you weren't at the show.

01:36:32.040 --> 01:36:33.660
- I'm sorry, J.D.
- I'm sure.

01:36:33.760 --> 01:36:34.980
But sorry don't mean shit.

01:36:35.080 --> 01:36:36.140
We're grown men.

01:36:36.240 --> 01:36:37.260
I see.

01:36:37.360 --> 01:36:39.100
Should I be taking notes on this lesson?

01:36:39.200 --> 01:36:41.980
Opry's a brand
and you're pissing on it, Hank.

01:36:42.080 --> 01:36:44.420
It means something to a lot of people.

01:36:44.520 --> 01:36:46.300
Music, family.

01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:47.606
Money?

01:36:48.440 --> 01:36:50.740
You want to play the artist on me?
All right, then.

01:36:50.840 --> 01:36:54.045
An artist like you, a man who can
make folks forget their troubles,

01:36:54.160 --> 01:36:55.571
you have an obligation.

01:36:58.440 --> 01:37:00.460
You been working me pretty hard, J.D.

01:37:00.560 --> 01:37:04.770
I mean, 100 out of 119 days on the road.

01:37:04.880 --> 01:37:06.769
I don't really need any more obligations.

01:37:06.880 --> 01:37:08.086
Nobody does.

01:37:08.840 --> 01:37:10.980
I'm not trying to be disrespectful, Hank.

01:37:11.080 --> 01:37:12.020
I'm not trying to put you down.

01:37:12.120 --> 01:37:13.100
Don't you worry.

01:37:13.200 --> 01:37:16.180
I gave up giving a shit about what
other people think a long time ago.

01:37:16.280 --> 01:37:17.660
All right, then.

01:37:17.760 --> 01:37:18.921
Here's the deal.

01:37:19.560 --> 01:37:22.260
August 9th in your regular Opry spot,

01:37:22.360 --> 01:37:25.569
and August 10th
an Opry-sponsored show in Knoxville.

01:37:30.040 --> 01:37:31.769
Sure, all right, okay.

01:37:33.040 --> 01:37:34.405
I'm imploring you.

01:37:34.760 --> 01:37:36.683
Don't let me down.

01:37:37.080 --> 01:37:39.526
They'll get their money's worth, sir.

01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:41.121
Okay.

01:37:41.320 --> 01:37:45.291
Of course I mean, Cousin Minnie Pearl!

01:37:51.800 --> 01:37:53.609
Howdy!

01:38:03.160 --> 01:38:05.891
Jambalaya hit number one today,
you know that?

01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:10.380
I had to do it, Red.

01:38:10.480 --> 01:38:12.369
I had to let Hank go.

01:38:32.600 --> 01:38:33.601
Hello?

01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:36.607
Hey, it's Hank.

01:38:36.720 --> 01:38:38.060
Hey, Hank, it's Sonny.

01:38:38.160 --> 01:38:39.900
Hey, Sonny,

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:41.331
Is your sister around?

01:38:44.920 --> 01:38:47.526
No, I don't know where she is.

01:38:49.800 --> 01:38:52.167
Hey, Sonny, help me out, will you?

01:38:52.360 --> 01:38:53.407
Sure.

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:56.411
Thanks, man.

01:39:14.200 --> 01:39:15.361
Hello.

01:39:18.360 --> 01:39:20.362
Bobbie, it's me.

01:39:22.800 --> 01:39:24.006
Hey, Hank.

01:39:26.680 --> 01:39:27.886
Hey.

01:39:31.200 --> 01:39:33.580
Listen, I was thinking,
why don't you pack a bag,

01:39:33.680 --> 01:39:36.809
and I'll come by in about a half-hour?

01:39:40.160 --> 01:39:41.525
Where are we going?

01:39:42.800 --> 01:39:44.131
Lake Martin.

01:39:44.520 --> 01:39:46.170
A lodge at Kowaliga Bay.

01:39:46.760 --> 01:39:48.410
It belongs to a pal of mine.

01:39:50.360 --> 01:39:51.441
What do you say?

01:39:57.200 --> 01:39:58.361
Make it an hour.

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:18.445
Bobbie?

01:40:28.120 --> 01:40:29.281
Bobbie.

01:40:30.440 --> 01:40:32.169
You're drunker than ol' Hank.

01:40:33.680 --> 01:40:35.091
Hank...

01:40:35.920 --> 01:40:37.490
I'm not drunk.

01:40:38.360 --> 01:40:40.601
- No?
- No.

01:40:43.840 --> 01:40:45.490
I'm pregnant.

01:40:48.920 --> 01:40:50.126
What?

01:40:53.120 --> 01:40:55.600
What is it with me?

01:40:57.760 --> 01:41:00.366
Every woman in my life has kids.

01:41:01.440 --> 01:41:03.010
Every one of them.

01:41:05.440 --> 01:41:07.580
Before I even got to them.

01:41:07.680 --> 01:41:08.660
Man.

01:41:08.760 --> 01:41:11.809
You're obviously very
attractive to mothers, Hank.

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:26.525
Jesus, Bobbie.

01:41:28.320 --> 01:41:29.401
You're pregnant.

01:41:33.520 --> 01:41:35.045
We could get married.

01:41:37.160 --> 01:41:39.561
Baby, you don't want to marry me.

01:41:41.280 --> 01:41:42.406
I will.

01:41:42.960 --> 01:41:44.246
That's different.

01:41:48.440 --> 01:41:51.683
Boy, I'm a professional
at making a mess of things.

01:41:55.280 --> 01:41:56.361
Hank,

01:41:57.680 --> 01:42:00.580
if we got married, things would be easier.

01:42:00.680 --> 01:42:02.364
They'd be more stable.

01:42:03.400 --> 01:42:05.100
And just think,

01:42:05.200 --> 01:42:07.202
we'd have this little one right here.

01:42:11.200 --> 01:42:12.361
Bobbie.

01:42:14.520 --> 01:42:16.170
I love you.

01:42:20.200 --> 01:42:22.248
But not like that.

01:42:26.760 --> 01:42:27.807
Not...

01:42:28.960 --> 01:42:30.371
Not that way.

01:42:40.960 --> 01:42:43.281
'Sides, I'm gonna marry Billie Jean.

01:42:46.240 --> 01:42:47.401
She know that?

01:42:50.880 --> 01:42:52.450
Not exactly.

01:42:55.880 --> 01:42:57.484
Listen, darlin'.

01:42:59.560 --> 01:43:02.450
I'm gonna look after this little baby.

01:43:05.520 --> 01:43:07.124
I'll send you money,

01:43:08.280 --> 01:43:10.282
and I'll be its papa, even.

01:43:13.600 --> 01:43:15.602
There ain't gonna be no marriage.

01:43:25.440 --> 01:43:28.444
Hank, you are really screwed up.

01:43:30.880 --> 01:43:31.961
I know.

01:43:33.640 --> 01:43:36.220
I pulled every string

01:43:36.320 --> 01:43:38.220
to get him back where he started,

01:43:38.320 --> 01:43:40.380
the Hayride in Louisiana.

01:43:40.480 --> 01:43:42.660
It wouldn't be the same money or exposure,

01:43:42.760 --> 01:43:44.380
but at least he wouldn't be idle.

01:43:44.480 --> 01:43:45.900
Hank idle, damn.

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:49.340
Before long, he had
a Nashville showgirl with child.

01:43:49.440 --> 01:43:52.820
And shortly after that,
he married Billie Jean Jones

01:43:52.920 --> 01:43:55.810
in the City Auditorium, New Orleans.

01:44:19.280 --> 01:44:22.700
It's not just my back, baby.

01:44:22.800 --> 01:44:23.801
I feel...

01:44:25.760 --> 01:44:27.660
I feel like my chest is,

01:44:27.760 --> 01:44:30.445
like, getting jumped on.

01:44:57.040 --> 01:44:58.060
Who are you?

01:44:58.160 --> 01:45:00.481
LeBeau, the promoter.

01:45:02.280 --> 01:45:03.420
And you?

01:45:03.520 --> 01:45:04.965
Dr. Marshall.

01:45:06.400 --> 01:45:08.100
What kind of doctor?

01:45:08.200 --> 01:45:10.248
I specialize in alcoholism.

01:45:11.760 --> 01:45:12.900
What does that mean?

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:14.540
What you got, Doc?

01:45:14.640 --> 01:45:16.244
What's the man have?

01:45:17.240 --> 01:45:19.481
It means I've been there and back, ma'am,

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:23.129
and I will help Mr. Williams
to a speedy recovery.

01:45:25.480 --> 01:45:27.482
Let the man in!

01:45:44.600 --> 01:45:46.602
It will be better, son.

01:45:56.240 --> 01:45:57.460
Chloral hydrate.

01:45:57.560 --> 01:46:01.140
So powerful, they use it
to sedate circus animals.

01:46:01.240 --> 01:46:03.100
It's never supposed to be
administered with alcohol

01:46:03.200 --> 01:46:08.300
or to someone with a heart condition,
which Hank likely had.

01:46:08.400 --> 01:46:10.020
Marshall,

01:46:10.120 --> 01:46:14.460
his diploma was from the Chicago University
of Applied Sciences and Arts.

01:46:14.560 --> 01:46:18.246
He bought it off a salesman
at a gas station for $25.

01:46:20.440 --> 01:46:24.240
And then Hank called me
and told me he was in Marshall's care.

01:46:37.680 --> 01:46:39.409
How you doing, son?

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.162
How long we got left?

01:46:45.600 --> 01:46:46.540
We can be done, Hank.

01:46:46.640 --> 01:46:48.005
Just call it a day.

01:46:57.680 --> 01:46:59.364
I got something

01:47:00.120 --> 01:47:02.009
I want to run past you.

01:47:03.160 --> 01:47:04.571
You sure?

01:47:11.120 --> 01:47:15.762
Your cheatin' heart

01:47:18.200 --> 01:47:21.522
Will make you weep

01:47:24.920 --> 01:47:30.245
You'll cry and cry

01:47:30.960 --> 01:47:34.760
And try to sleep

01:47:36.360 --> 01:47:40.410
But sleep won't come

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:46.085
The whole night through

01:47:47.200 --> 01:47:51.842
Your cheatin' heart

01:47:52.560 --> 01:47:56.485
Will tell on you

01:47:58.040 --> 01:48:03.180
When tears come down

01:48:03.280 --> 01:48:07.444
Like falling rain

01:48:08.680 --> 01:48:14.100
You'll toss around

01:48:14.200 --> 01:48:18.603
And call my name

01:48:19.400 --> 01:48:22.847
You'll walk the floor

01:48:24.880 --> 01:48:29.044
The way I do

01:48:30.360 --> 01:48:35.730
Your cheatin' heart

01:48:38.160 --> 01:48:44.202
Will tell on you

01:48:58.560 --> 01:48:59.900
Hey,

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:01.411
I heard you got a new toy,

01:49:02.160 --> 01:49:03.340
It's a choo-choo train.

01:49:03.440 --> 01:49:05.340
Are you gonna play with me?

01:49:05.440 --> 01:49:08.091
I'll be right there just as soon as I can.

01:49:10.640 --> 01:49:12.900
You know how much I miss you,
don't you, Bocephus?

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.540
Than all the ants on the sidewalks,

01:49:15.640 --> 01:49:18.325
and all the leaves in the trees.

01:49:23.080 --> 01:49:24.047
That's right.

01:49:24.160 --> 01:49:25.780
Hey, baby, can I talk to Daddy?

01:49:25.880 --> 01:49:27.245
Thank you.

01:49:27.640 --> 01:49:29.540
Hey, Hank? We got to go now.

01:49:29.640 --> 01:49:32.246
It's getting past his bedtime,
and I don't want him getting worked up.

01:49:33.120 --> 01:49:35.700
Audrey, why don't you
bring him up to Shreveport this weekend?

01:49:35.800 --> 01:49:37.290
Well, that won't work out.

01:49:37.920 --> 01:49:39.331
Well, why not?

01:49:39.880 --> 01:49:41.980
I mean, it'd just be for the Saturday,

01:49:42.080 --> 01:49:43.570
You could leave him here and,

01:49:43.680 --> 01:49:45.887
you know, we'll bring him back.

01:49:46.240 --> 01:49:48.083
Well, we got plans Saturday.

01:49:48.960 --> 01:49:50.180
Well, how about Sunday, then?

01:49:50.280 --> 01:49:51.691
No, that won't work.

01:49:52.520 --> 01:49:54.522
We're just gonna have to find
a better time, okay?

01:49:55.600 --> 01:49:56.820
So, I'm gonna talk to you later.

01:49:56.920 --> 01:49:58.365
Okay, hon? Bye.

01:50:42.400 --> 01:50:44.420
The first task of the new administration

01:50:44.520 --> 01:50:46.841
will be to review and reexamine...

01:50:51.600 --> 01:50:54.300
...we have a time-out
existing on the playing field

01:50:54.400 --> 01:50:56.402
on the part
of the University of Alabama...

01:51:02.360 --> 01:51:03.566
Do you have to?

01:51:06.560 --> 01:51:08.130
Yeah, I kind of do.

01:51:19.440 --> 01:51:21.044
Well, honey,

01:51:22.880 --> 01:51:25.360
I'm real glad you're skipping
some of them dates.

01:51:26.760 --> 01:51:28.762
Taking some time.

01:51:30.760 --> 01:51:33.331
And I'm real glad
we're getting out of Shreveport.

01:51:34.440 --> 01:51:35.620
But to tell you the truth,

01:51:35.720 --> 01:51:38.200
I don't really want to see your mother.

01:51:38.960 --> 01:51:40.086
I know that.

01:51:41.760 --> 01:51:44.240
Still, at least,
she'll be happy to see me.

01:51:45.120 --> 01:51:47.646
Lately, people see me coming,
they want to cross the street.

01:51:48.120 --> 01:51:49.804
Well, that's just not true.

01:51:55.040 --> 01:51:56.405
I'm sorry, baby.

01:51:58.120 --> 01:51:59.531
For what?

01:52:03.320 --> 01:52:04.765
Everything.

01:52:08.080 --> 01:52:10.082
A.V Bamford had booked Hank

01:52:10.200 --> 01:52:13.647
for two dates at the end of December.

01:52:14.320 --> 01:52:16.740
New Year's Eve in Charleston,
West Virginia,

01:52:16.840 --> 01:52:19.100
New Year's Day in Canton, Ohio.

01:52:19.200 --> 01:52:21.487
Hank looked around

01:52:21.800 --> 01:52:25.168
for someone to drive him in his own car.

01:52:26.120 --> 01:52:30.340
And when he couldn't find any friends
to take him up on that,

01:52:30.440 --> 01:52:34.260
he called a buddy of his at
Lee Street Taxi in Montgomery.

01:52:34.360 --> 01:52:36.169
And that fella

01:52:36.680 --> 01:52:38.500
got his 17-year-old son,

01:52:38.600 --> 01:52:41.700
Charles Carr, to do the job.

01:52:41.800 --> 01:52:45.122
Charles was a freshman
at Auburn on holiday break.

01:53:02.760 --> 01:53:03.940
Can you take care of that for me?

01:53:04.040 --> 01:53:05.246
Yes, sir.

01:53:07.480 --> 01:53:09.289
Be careful with that, Charles.

01:53:22.800 --> 01:53:24.450
Come here, baby.

01:53:31.040 --> 01:53:33.327
I'll call you when I get up to Charleston.

01:53:33.760 --> 01:53:36.127
How come I can't come?

01:53:39.560 --> 01:53:42.260
Go back to Shreveport,
I'll meet you in a couple days.

01:53:42.360 --> 01:53:43.725
You don't have to stay.

01:53:44.960 --> 01:53:47.770
I don't see the big deal, me coming along.

01:53:48.240 --> 01:53:49.526
Well,

01:53:50.960 --> 01:53:52.724
it's a long-ass trip.

01:53:54.080 --> 01:53:55.570
And, truthfully,

01:53:57.760 --> 01:53:59.603
we might get real sick of each other.

01:53:59.960 --> 01:54:01.644
You might end up going at me, right?

01:54:20.520 --> 01:54:22.522
One more for luck, huh?

01:54:27.080 --> 01:54:29.606
- Watch your head, Mr. Williams.
- Thank you, sir.

01:54:38.960 --> 01:54:40.780
What are you smiling about?

01:54:40.880 --> 01:54:44.168
Well, another reason
I think you shouldn't come,

01:54:45.680 --> 01:54:47.330
I could use the leg room.

01:54:49.600 --> 01:54:51.500
Drive safe, Charles.

01:54:51.600 --> 01:54:55.082
He's a real SOB, but I think I love him.

01:54:55.760 --> 01:54:57.330
Yes, ma'am.

01:54:58.800 --> 01:55:00.802
Listen to the boss, Charles.

01:55:08.200 --> 01:55:09.770
I'll see you in Louisiana, darlin'.

01:55:13.840 --> 01:55:15.251
Happy New Year.

01:56:21.240 --> 01:56:22.890
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:56:24.320 --> 01:56:28.086
I've been in show business
for almost 20 years.

01:56:31.320 --> 01:56:32.731
But today,

01:56:33.600 --> 01:56:36.843
will be the most difficult task
I've ever had to perform.

01:56:41.200 --> 01:56:42.804
This morning,

01:56:43.080 --> 01:56:46.607
on his way to Canton to do this show,

01:56:49.120 --> 01:56:51.521
Hank Williams died in his car.

01:57:03.440 --> 01:57:07.968
I wandered so aimless

01:57:08.760 --> 01:57:12.924
Life filled with sin

01:57:13.760 --> 01:57:17.140
I wouldn't let my

01:57:17.240 --> 01:57:20.244
Dear Savior in

01:57:21.920 --> 01:57:24.900
Then Jesus came like

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:28.243
A stranger in the night

01:57:29.080 --> 01:57:32.140
Praise the Lord

01:57:32.240 --> 01:57:35.130
I saw the light

01:57:35.800 --> 01:57:38.849
I saw the light

01:57:39.080 --> 01:57:42.380
I saw the light

01:57:42.480 --> 01:57:45.780
No more darkness

01:57:45.880 --> 01:57:48.804
No more night

01:57:49.320 --> 01:57:52.540
Now I'm so happy

01:57:52.640 --> 01:57:55.700
No sorrow in sight

01:57:55.800 --> 01:57:57.500
Praise the Lord...

01:57:57.600 --> 01:58:00.100
Montgomery Alabama,

01:58:00.200 --> 01:58:02.931
January 4th, 1953.

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.580
Hank Williams laid to rest in Dixie.

01:58:06.680 --> 01:58:09.860
I saw the light...

01:58:09.960 --> 01:58:12.300
The top singer-songwriter died tragically

01:58:12.400 --> 01:58:14.243
of severe heart damage.

01:58:15.120 --> 01:58:17.248
He was 29 years old.

01:58:17.920 --> 01:58:19.940
In only six years of recording,

01:58:20.040 --> 01:58:22.060
he had a remarkable 36 hit songs

01:58:22.160 --> 01:58:25.004
and sold over 11 million records.

01:58:26.560 --> 01:58:31.060
Fans, friends and family
gave the boy from Mount Olive

01:58:31.160 --> 01:58:33.580
the state's largest send-off ever,

01:58:33.680 --> 01:58:35.460
accompanied by the mournful sounds

01:58:35.560 --> 01:58:39.100
of his buddies' steel guitars
and weeping fiddles.

01:58:39.200 --> 01:58:40.900
No more darkness

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:43.765
No more night...
