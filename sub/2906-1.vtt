00:42.180 --> 00:43.847
3, 2, 1.

01:31.297 --> 01:34.698
Well, I’m just paying attention
to you.  I am not hovering.

01:34.700 --> 01:36.100
Okay.

01:36.102 --> 01:37.534
You're always
gonna be my baby.

01:37.536 --> 01:39.536
- Let's go.
- I’m not ready.

01:39.538 --> 01:42.206
- H-how can you not be ready?
- I’m not ready yet.

03:06.092 --> 03:07.591
H-hover?
You think I hover?

03:07.593 --> 03:09.526
You've always been, like,
hovering over me.

03:14.967 --> 03:17.367
Lloyd.

03:17.369 --> 03:19.103
Lloyd.

03:19.105 --> 03:21.271
Lloyd, Lloyd, what are you doing?

03:21.273 --> 03:24.041
Do you love your mommy?
Did you wear your seat belt?

03:27.513 --> 03:28.512
Are we here?

03:28.514 --> 03:29.780
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:29.782 --> 03:31.515
Hang on, hang on.

03:31.517 --> 03:33.217
Stay there.
I’m comin' to get you!

03:35.186 --> 03:36.687
Can I take
the blindfold off yet?

03:36.689 --> 03:38.188
No!
Get out of the car!

03:38.190 --> 03:40.023
Okay, walk.

03:40.025 --> 03:41.558
There's a curb there.
Step back. all right.
oh. all right.

03:41.560 --> 03:44.495
And...and...

03:44.497 --> 03:46.330
Happy birthday!

03:46.332 --> 03:47.498
Yeah.

03:47.500 --> 03:48.966
We're gonna have the best day!

03:48.968 --> 03:51.368
Come on!

03:51.370 --> 03:53.971
Look at this! Isn't this the
best place on earth?

03:53.973 --> 03:55.739
Yeah, it's something.

03:55.741 --> 03:57.708
Come on! oh, Tattoos!
Let's get matching tattoos.

03:57.710 --> 04:00.344
Oh, yes, that's just what
I’ve always wanted.

04:00.346 --> 04:01.345
Really?

04:01.347 --> 04:03.147
No! Not really.

04:05.750 --> 04:07.017
Happy birthday!
Yeah.

04:07.019 --> 04:08.619
Got it.
All right.

04:13.191 --> 04:14.858
Look here.

04:14.860 --> 04:16.827
You've taken enough pictures
to fill a wedding album.

04:16.829 --> 04:18.762
Will you stop?
I have not taken nearly enough.

04:21.499 --> 04:22.699
It smells like a sku--
is there a skunk?

04:22.701 --> 04:24.234
A what?
It smells like a skunk.

04:24.236 --> 04:25.502
Come on.
You don't smell that?

04:25.504 --> 04:26.770
It's just weed.
It's nothing --

04:26.772 --> 04:28.272
Oh, God.
There's nothing wrong with it.

04:33.511 --> 04:35.179
What's left after this?

04:35.181 --> 04:37.948
Prom, then graduation,
and then you're gone!

04:37.950 --> 04:39.416
You're gone!

04:39.418 --> 04:40.584
And all I’m gonna have left
are these photos.

04:40.586 --> 04:41.885
Mom --

04:41.887 --> 04:43.387
Photos that I am gonna
flip through

04:43.389 --> 04:44.788
in that dark house all alone.

04:44.790 --> 04:46.523
It's just college.
I’m going to college.

04:46.525 --> 04:48.292
If I get in
and if I get a scholarship.

04:48.294 --> 04:50.761
I’m not signing up for a tour
of duty in the Middle East.

04:50.763 --> 04:52.563
But then you're gonna
meet a nice girl.

04:52.565 --> 04:53.864
Don't you understand?

04:53.866 --> 04:55.599
You're gonna go get married
in Minnesota.

04:55.601 --> 04:57.401
Mom, I think you're getting
a little bit ahead of yourself.

04:57.403 --> 04:59.303
Then kids!  Ah, then kids.

04:59.305 --> 05:01.405
And then you're not gonna
have time for your mom.

05:01.407 --> 05:03.540
Well, if you're lucky,
I’ll turn out to be gay.

05:10.048 --> 05:11.715
We're gonna take some of these.

05:11.717 --> 05:12.716
What are we doing?

05:12.718 --> 05:13.750
Oh, these are great.

05:13.752 --> 05:15.919
Right?
I can't even...

05:15.921 --> 05:16.987
Oh, yeah.

05:16.989 --> 05:18.722
Oh, what the --  put this on.

05:18.724 --> 05:20.090
This is not --
this is clearly not a man's hat.

05:20.092 --> 05:21.325
This is very good, very good.

05:21.327 --> 05:22.759
I think I look
like Lady Gaga right now.

05:22.761 --> 05:24.294
This is me.
This is  <i>so</i>  me. Look!

05:24.296 --> 05:25.662
This is -- what's this called,
a "selfie"?

05:25.664 --> 05:26.930
Yeah.

05:26.932 --> 05:28.565
And now...
now what?

05:28.567 --> 05:30.500
...It's time to come out.
come out of -- what?

05:30.502 --> 05:32.903
Ooh! okay, all right,
Sorry.

05:32.905 --> 05:34.137
What are you,
too busy playing dress-up

05:34.139 --> 05:35.672
to watch where you're walking...

05:35.674 --> 05:36.940
Sheila?
I’m sorry. It was an accident.

05:36.942 --> 05:38.275
Listen, we were just
kidding around.

05:38.277 --> 05:39.243
We're just hanging out.
It's all right.

05:39.245 --> 05:40.544
Just an accident.
Sorry.

05:40.546 --> 05:42.913
Aw, does your mommy
fight all your battles for ya?

05:44.283 --> 05:47.416
Okay. Why don't you just leave my son
alone, you big loser?

05:47.419 --> 05:49.152
Okay. all right, mom. let's go.
Let's just --

05:49.154 --> 05:50.554
Mom, let's -- let's go.

05:50.556 --> 05:52.923
Hey lady, get your faggot son
and get outta here

05:52.925 --> 05:54.291
before we  <i>make</i>  you
get outta here.

05:54.293 --> 05:55.692
Let's -- let's do that.
Let's go.

05:55.694 --> 05:57.628
You're right.
We should just go.

05:57.630 --> 05:58.662
Mom!

06:02.300 --> 06:03.667
Yeah. Hit a woman.

06:03.669 --> 06:05.402
That always turns out well.

06:10.041 --> 06:11.775
Uh...

06:13.344 --> 06:14.711
Excuse me!

06:14.713 --> 06:16.446
- Go! Go! Go! Go!
- Go! Go! Go! Oh, my God!

06:16.448 --> 06:18.048
- So, you  <i>had</i>  to slap him.
- Oh, my God. Run! Run! Run!

06:18.050 --> 06:19.716
I’m running as fast
as I can, Mom!

06:19.718 --> 06:21.118
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
Gotta go.  Go! Go! Go!

06:23.055 --> 06:25.522
That way! That way!
That way! That way!

06:29.027 --> 06:32.462
Uh...honey, Go! Go!
Come here. Come here. This way.

06:32.464 --> 06:35.132
- This way. Come on. Come on. Come on.
- Okay, okay.

06:36.235 --> 06:37.334
You all right?

06:37.336 --> 06:38.869
Yeah, fine.

06:38.871 --> 06:40.971
- I’m fi--
- Mom? Mom?

06:40.973 --> 06:42.172
I’m fi-- I’m fine.
I’m fine.

06:45.177 --> 06:47.511
Here we go.

06:47.513 --> 06:49.179
You're gonna scare --

06:49.181 --> 06:50.714
- Oh, come on, Mom.
- Look away.

06:50.716 --> 06:52.049
There's nowhere for me to look

06:52.051 --> 06:53.583
that I’m remotely comfortable with.

06:53.585 --> 06:55.919
All right, Miss Cooper.
These are painkillers.

06:55.921 --> 06:59.323
Only take two a day.
- Oh, drugs?

06:59.325 --> 07:01.658
I don't know about drugs.

07:01.660 --> 07:04.261
You know, I try to keep my body in
a harmonious, earthy balance.

07:04.263 --> 07:06.330
That's good to hear,
Miss Cooper.

07:06.332 --> 07:08.565
Every day I make myself
a green smoothie.

07:08.567 --> 07:13.403
Just all the green stuff from
my...organic garden.

07:13.405 --> 07:15.005
I just take that stuff
and I just throw it in there

07:15.007 --> 07:18.342
like pea pods and broccoli
and kale

07:18.344 --> 07:19.443
and quenoah.

07:19.445 --> 07:21.078
- I think that's quinoa.
- Mmm.

07:21.080 --> 07:22.446
Quinoa, too.

07:22.448 --> 07:24.881
- Eating healthy is important.
- Mm-hmm.

07:24.883 --> 07:26.550
You need to make sure
you're balancing it with exercise.

07:26.552 --> 07:27.951
Are you exercising?
- Oh, yeah.

07:27.953 --> 07:30.053
I go to the gym so much
that they're like,

07:30.055 --> 07:31.421
"Maggie Cooper, get out!"

07:31.423 --> 07:34.958
I do yoga and pilates
and yogalates.

07:34.960 --> 07:37.361
You know what else I do?
pole dancing.

07:37.363 --> 07:40.197
I  <i>love</i>  to pole dance.

07:40.200 --> 07:43.367
I go up and down that pole.
I just love it.

07:43.369 --> 07:44.968
Miss Cooper, you need to take
this seriously, okay?

07:44.970 --> 07:46.069
- Oh, yeah.
- Yes.

07:46.071 --> 07:47.437
Mm-hmm.

07:47.439 --> 07:48.972
My mother passed away
last year, okay?

07:48.974 --> 07:50.774
- Ah.
- From a stroke.

07:50.776 --> 07:52.409
She had just a few
anxiety attacks before

07:52.411 --> 07:53.944
for warning signs, okay?

07:53.946 --> 07:55.579
So we need
to take this seriously.

07:55.581 --> 07:56.813
- Okay.
- Okay.

07:56.815 --> 07:57.881
Yeah, all good.

08:01.453 --> 08:03.553
- His mother?
- I, mm, told you not to.

08:03.555 --> 08:05.288
- His damn mother?
- I warned you.

08:05.290 --> 08:07.624
Oh, my God. that was awful.
Get the car.

08:07.626 --> 08:08.925
What?

08:08.927 --> 08:10.460
- Get the car! Let's go!
- All right.

08:10.462 --> 08:12.295
We're out of here.
Give me these.

08:12.297 --> 08:16.066
You know, I think you were
winning him over there at the end.

08:21.906 --> 08:23.140
Ma'am?

08:23.142 --> 08:24.408
Don't call me "ma'am"!

08:24.410 --> 08:26.076
Excuse me!

08:28.012 --> 08:29.913
Always prepared.

08:29.915 --> 08:31.515
What would I do without you?

08:31.517 --> 08:33.116
I don't know.

08:33.118 --> 08:35.619
Aww, you know what?
These pills don't work, though.

08:35.621 --> 08:38.288
They just are...

08:39.691 --> 08:41.491
Okay. Here we go.

08:41.493 --> 08:43.126
You know you're wearing a
hospital gown, right?

09:01.779 --> 09:04.514
Excuse me.

09:04.516 --> 09:05.849
- What up, boy?
- Hey!

09:05.851 --> 09:07.851
Happy birthday, dude!

09:07.853 --> 09:09.319
You know, I almost didn't
recognize you

09:09.321 --> 09:10.520
without the dick in your face.

09:10.522 --> 09:11.988
What up, dude?

09:11.990 --> 09:13.390
Later, douche!

09:14.293 --> 09:16.827
That is great.

09:16.829 --> 09:18.895
Happy birthday!

09:18.897 --> 09:20.564
Oh, thanks, Fitch.
Thanks a lot, man.

09:20.566 --> 09:22.132
Yeah, promise I won't hug you.

09:22.134 --> 09:23.867
She treats me
like I’m 10 years old.

09:23.869 --> 09:25.702
- Yeah, dude, this is a bad one.
- I know.

09:25.704 --> 09:27.070
But at least she cares.

09:27.072 --> 09:28.472
Yeah, she cares
a little bit too much.

09:28.474 --> 09:32.142
There's another dick in my face.
I give up.

09:32.144 --> 09:34.678
I have a question for you.

09:34.680 --> 09:37.147
How in the world
did you find the time

09:37.149 --> 09:40.383
to plaster those awful
pictures of me all over school?

09:40.385 --> 09:42.252
What pictures?

09:42.254 --> 09:43.653
The one -- come on.

09:43.655 --> 09:45.555
Who else was with me
at the dentist?

09:45.557 --> 09:46.823
Nobody.  It was just you.

09:46.825 --> 09:48.325
What happened at the dentist?

09:48.327 --> 09:50.193
They're the pictures of me
when I have the --

09:50.195 --> 09:51.862
the, like, gauze stuffed
in my mouth?

09:51.864 --> 09:53.230
Aren't they great?!

09:53.232 --> 09:54.931
- Yeah, no. They're awful.
- Come on!

09:54.933 --> 09:56.533
- They're embarrassing.
- That -- did everybody laugh?

09:56.535 --> 09:58.168
<i>At</i>  me.
They were laughing  <i>at</i>  me.

09:58.170 --> 10:00.103
Well, it's kind of fun.
That's like a love thing.

10:00.105 --> 10:01.438
No, it was rough.

10:01.440 --> 10:03.240
- Oh, I’m so sorry.
- It was a lot of that.

10:03.242 --> 10:04.741
- On your 17th birthday.
- I know.

10:04.743 --> 10:06.009
This should be a great day.

10:06.011 --> 10:07.277
- It should be, but it wasn't.
- I’m so --

10:07.279 --> 10:08.678
It was -- it was hard.

10:08.680 --> 10:11.248
Let's pause for a moment
and remember the day,

10:11.250 --> 10:13.850
for me, the moment
you popped out of my cooch.

10:13.852 --> 10:15.118
Oh, God!

10:15.120 --> 10:16.386
Wish time.

10:16.388 --> 10:17.687
Okay. all right.

10:17.689 --> 10:18.788
All right.

10:21.025 --> 10:22.392
- Okay.
- Okay.

10:22.394 --> 10:23.426
- One wish.
- Mm-hmm.

10:23.428 --> 10:24.728
And I have to be in it.

10:24.730 --> 10:26.463
You are.  Okay.

10:27.932 --> 10:29.933
Yay! Happy birthday.

10:29.935 --> 10:31.801
Oh, I didn't get it.
I didn't get it!

10:31.803 --> 10:34.771
- Come on, can we be done, please?
- Done?

10:34.773 --> 10:36.806
It's just --
it's too much, Mom.

10:36.808 --> 10:38.275
I love you so much.
Okay, ready?

10:38.277 --> 10:40.043
Happy birthday. Okay. Okay.

10:40.045 --> 10:42.779
- Okay. All right. Okay, you ready?
- Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm.

10:42.781 --> 10:44.481
Three, two, one. Okay.

10:44.483 --> 10:45.782
Okay.

10:45.784 --> 10:48.952
We're still doing that,
but -- okay.

10:53.658 --> 10:56.927
Uh, I think you need to
check the printer.

10:56.929 --> 10:58.128
This --
this printed very light.

10:58.130 --> 10:59.629
Will you check on that?

10:59.631 --> 11:01.097
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks.

11:01.099 --> 11:03.166
Uh, satisfactory, Fitch.

11:03.168 --> 11:05.268
Story of my life.

11:05.270 --> 11:06.903
And that was beautiful,
Lloyd.

11:06.905 --> 11:08.305
Thank you.

11:08.307 --> 11:10.607
- Do you write a lot of poetry?
- No.

11:10.609 --> 11:12.676
You know,
you should do it more often.

11:12.678 --> 11:14.110
Poetry?

11:14.112 --> 11:16.346
Faggot!

11:17.616 --> 11:19.416
At least he can read

11:19.418 --> 11:21.117
<i>and</i>  write, Brad.

11:21.119 --> 11:23.253
Carrie, what do I need
to write for, okay?

11:23.255 --> 11:24.588
Look at me.

11:24.590 --> 11:26.690
I got a body
built for success.

11:26.692 --> 11:29.859
and an I.Q. lower
than the room temperature.

11:29.861 --> 11:31.962
Yeah? well,
that didn't stop Ryan Lochte.

11:33.165 --> 11:36.166
Ew. really?  Gross, Brad.

11:36.168 --> 11:38.602
Lloyd, did you submit anything
to the fine arts assembly?

11:38.604 --> 11:39.769
No.

11:39.771 --> 11:40.971
Well, now you have.

11:40.973 --> 11:42.605
You're going to read  <i>this.</i>
- I Can't.

11:42.607 --> 11:45.942
You've gotta share this
with as many people as possible.

11:45.944 --> 11:47.611
The thing is, uh, is -- is --
is Lloyd can't do crowds.

11:47.613 --> 11:49.045
No.
Really, though.

11:49.047 --> 11:51.314
Just think about it.

11:51.316 --> 11:52.716
Okay, guys,
see you all next time.

11:58.990 --> 12:02.158
So, um, you think I could maybe

12:02.160 --> 12:03.827
read some of
your stuff sometime?

12:03.829 --> 12:05.228
I really like poetry.

12:05.230 --> 12:09.199
Uh, no, no.
No, I-it -- it's not good.

12:09.201 --> 12:13.370
I don't -- I don't like, um,
like showing it to anybody.

12:13.372 --> 12:14.471
Much less reading it out loud.

12:14.473 --> 12:17.841
I ca-- I can't.
- Well, um...

12:17.843 --> 12:21.711
if you change your mind,
let me know.

12:39.397 --> 12:41.231
Thanks, Lloyd.

12:41.233 --> 12:43.900
Yeah, sure, Drew.

12:57.548 --> 12:58.948
Oh. Hey.

12:58.950 --> 13:00.016
Thank you.

13:00.018 --> 13:01.518
Are you seeing anyone?

13:01.520 --> 13:02.419
No.

13:02.421 --> 13:03.620
When was your first kiss?

13:03.622 --> 13:05.855
What -- what is this?

13:05.857 --> 13:06.956
Do you wanna be kissed?

13:06.958 --> 13:08.191
- No.
- Okay.

13:08.293 --> 13:08.925
Okay.

13:08.927 --> 13:10.427
Okay.

13:10.429 --> 13:13.697
Oh, yeah. I get it. Okay.

13:18.636 --> 13:20.637
I am  <i>not</i>  here. Just cleaning.

13:20.639 --> 13:23.440
Just got stuff to do.

13:25.644 --> 13:28.545
What do you think about
when you...

13:30.716 --> 13:32.382
Okay, that's gross.

13:32.384 --> 13:33.650
That is  <i>not</i>  okay to talk about.

13:33.652 --> 13:34.951
We cannot talk about that, okay?

13:34.953 --> 13:36.619
Got it, okay. okay.

13:36.621 --> 13:38.088
- We don't have to talk about it.
- No, we don't.

13:38.090 --> 13:41.458
I’m just gonna ask you, though.
do you...dust?

13:41.460 --> 13:44.427
I’m not gonna --
I don't wanna talk about...

13:44.429 --> 13:45.995
masturbate-- with you.

13:45.997 --> 13:47.163
Okay. got it.
I’m not even gonna...

13:47.165 --> 13:48.598
that is cool.
I am totally out.

13:48.600 --> 13:49.599
...dignify that question
with a response.

13:49.601 --> 13:51.134
Okay.

13:53.238 --> 13:55.905
Too loud.

13:55.907 --> 13:58.842
I’m so sorry. I’m -- I’m so sorry.
It's...

13:58.844 --> 14:01.811
If you like boys,
I’m totally into that.

14:01.813 --> 14:03.847
If I what?
I would support that 100%.

14:03.849 --> 14:05.315
Okay.

14:05.317 --> 14:07.851
In my sophomore year,
I had a thing with a girl.

14:07.853 --> 14:09.185
- I know. Mindy.
- Mindy!

14:09.187 --> 14:10.754
- I know.
- You listened! God.

14:10.756 --> 14:12.188
I’ve heard the story
so many times.

14:12.190 --> 14:14.324
The beautiful thing
about girl-on-girl action,

14:14.326 --> 14:16.760
and boy-on-boy --
they know what they're doing.
- Okay, okay. No.

14:16.762 --> 14:18.461
There wouldn't be, like,
a minute of, like,

14:18.463 --> 14:20.697
"Hey, don't touch that.
that's not a button."

14:20.699 --> 14:21.898
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Mom? Mom? Mom?

14:21.900 --> 14:23.333
Can I just do my homework,
please?

14:23.335 --> 14:26.603
There's nothing wrong with being
a little wild and free in your youth.

14:26.605 --> 14:28.104
I just wanna get to know you
a little bit better.

14:28.106 --> 14:30.640
Okay, then join the PTA
like all the other moms.

14:30.642 --> 14:33.109
Okay! I can do that!

14:33.111 --> 14:34.711
Not really.

14:34.713 --> 14:36.012
God, I love you!
That's a great idea.

14:36.014 --> 14:37.781
No! Mom, no!

14:57.034 --> 14:59.702
Make sure that everybody
is checking --

14:59.704 --> 15:04.274
Hey, ladies! Maggie Cooper.
Sorry I’m late.

15:06.210 --> 15:08.311
As I was saying,

15:08.313 --> 15:10.413
prom will be here sooner
than you can believe!

15:10.415 --> 15:12.015
Clap, clap, clap!

15:12.017 --> 15:14.851
And, of course,
I am keeping track

15:14.853 --> 15:17.687
of your mandatory
volunteer hours.

15:17.689 --> 15:20.690
I’m looking at you, Norma.
you have to build the hours up.

15:20.692 --> 15:23.226
I’ve noticed that your checklist
has been down.

15:25.063 --> 15:27.697
Oh, for goodness sake,

15:27.699 --> 15:30.033
Is that a diaphragm
on our beautiful table?

15:30.035 --> 15:32.502
It's all good.
Just gonna take notes.

15:34.673 --> 15:37.273
I’m looking forward to
everybody's decoration ideas.

15:37.275 --> 15:39.542
I know last year a lot of us
were in a slump,

15:39.544 --> 15:41.778
so I know this year
you are going to wow me,

15:41.780 --> 15:43.446
and I’m very excited.

15:43.448 --> 15:45.515
Now, don't forget
to please make sure

15:45.517 --> 15:47.450
you are on the correct
e-mail lists

15:47.452 --> 15:49.085
for your respective committees.

15:49.087 --> 15:51.221
and if all of you haven't
signed up

15:51.223 --> 15:52.789
as chair of committees

15:52.791 --> 15:56.059
and roped in every single parent
from every single class,

15:56.061 --> 15:59.562
it will be noted by Barbara Wolfe.

15:59.564 --> 16:03.333
Excuse me.
who's Barbara Wolfe?

16:04.769 --> 16:07.804
I am Barbara Wolfe!

16:07.806 --> 16:11.407
Dr. Barbara Sloan-Huntington Wolfe

16:11.409 --> 16:14.143
of the Pasadena Sloan-Huntingtons!

16:14.145 --> 16:16.145
All good.

16:18.382 --> 16:20.483
Namasté.

16:20.485 --> 16:23.453
This meeting is adjourned.

16:23.455 --> 16:26.456
Has Robert completed
his Zimmerman applications?

16:26.458 --> 16:29.092
I hear it is due at the end
of the month.

16:29.094 --> 16:31.895
Yes, and the, uh, Peterson
and the O'Reilly.

16:31.897 --> 16:33.630
Oh! Good for Robert.

16:33.632 --> 16:35.265
Oh, did you
fill out the F.F.E.L.?

16:35.267 --> 16:36.933
Yes, and the L.E.A.P.
and the S.S.I.G.

16:36.935 --> 16:38.601
Oh, my Carrie's in the same boat.

16:38.603 --> 16:40.470
God help me,
it is like pulling teeth

16:40.472 --> 16:42.171
to get her to
finish these things.

16:42.173 --> 16:44.140
Well, hasn't she taken the SATs?

16:44.142 --> 16:45.475
National Merit Scholar.

16:45.477 --> 16:46.843
Barbara!  That's wonderful.

16:46.845 --> 16:49.445
Oh!
I bet you guys didn't know

16:49.447 --> 16:52.148
that her little Melanie had
to file for FAFSA.

16:52.150 --> 16:53.316
No.

16:53.318 --> 16:55.285
Yes.

16:55.287 --> 16:56.920
They aren't doing well?

16:56.922 --> 16:59.522
There's no shame in filing
for financial aid, is there?

16:59.524 --> 17:00.757
No.

17:00.759 --> 17:01.758
No, of course not,
sweetheart.

17:01.760 --> 17:02.759
Well, damn.

17:02.761 --> 17:04.027
Excuse me?

17:04.029 --> 17:06.863
Sorry. I forget
where I am sometimes.

17:06.865 --> 17:08.964
Sorry about that.  Maggie Cooper.

17:08.967 --> 17:10.465
How you guys doin'?

17:10.468 --> 17:13.202
Um, I’m Lloyd's mom.

17:13.204 --> 17:15.305
Our kids are frie--
Maybe you --

17:15.307 --> 17:17.272
your kids are friends
with my son, Lloyd?

17:17.275 --> 17:20.143
What activities does he do?

17:20.145 --> 17:21.644
What activities are there?

17:21.646 --> 17:25.949
Um, clubs, athletics,
extracurriculars --

17:25.951 --> 17:27.717
student government, debate,
mathletes.

17:27.719 --> 17:29.452
He reads a lot.

17:29.454 --> 17:31.788
Well, then he's probably not
friends with our children.

17:31.790 --> 17:34.557
Well, I’m here to change that!
That's what I’m doing!

17:34.559 --> 17:36.459
I am here to volunteer for stuff.

17:36.461 --> 17:37.794
I can be on prom committee.

17:37.796 --> 17:39.329
I just wanna be more involved
in his school

17:39.331 --> 17:41.230
before he leaves
for college, you know?

17:41.232 --> 17:42.999
So, uh, sign me up.
Whatcha got?

17:43.001 --> 17:44.867
If we need something,
I’ll let you know.

17:44.869 --> 17:46.302
So what do you guys
wanna do now?

17:46.304 --> 17:47.804
Wanna go get a drink?

17:48.973 --> 17:51.841
Okay, wh-what you're going to do
is show up next week,

17:51.843 --> 17:55.044
on time, sit down quietly,
preferably by the door,

17:55.046 --> 17:58.314
so I can ask you to leave if
you cause another disturbance.

18:00.184 --> 18:02.151
<i>- Those bitches.
- The nerve.</i.</i>

18:02.153 --> 18:03.853
<i>Just because Lloyd's
a little bookish</i>

18:03.855 --> 18:06.155
doesn't mean their kids are any better.
- Exactly.

18:06.157 --> 18:07.690
But it did get me thinking,
though,

18:07.692 --> 18:09.492
what am I gonna do
about Lloyd's financial aid?

18:09.494 --> 18:10.827
Do you know
how much college is?

18:10.829 --> 18:11.861
A hundred grand.

18:14.099 --> 18:16.532
I thought it was like 30.

18:16.534 --> 18:19.669
What am I gonna do if he gets
into an Ivy League school?

18:19.671 --> 18:22.071
You really want him going
some... far away from home?

18:22.073 --> 18:23.339
No, I do not.

18:23.341 --> 18:25.008
I gotta get creative.

18:25.010 --> 18:26.409
I gotta think.

18:26.411 --> 18:28.444
There are scholarships available,

18:28.446 --> 18:30.346
but the competition is fierce.

18:30.348 --> 18:32.281
It's a shame he's not
a minority.

18:32.283 --> 18:36.052
They have tons of
scholarships for minorities.

18:36.054 --> 18:39.555
Latino, African-American,
women, amputees,

18:39.557 --> 18:42.692
albinos, Pacific Islanders.

18:42.694 --> 18:45.628
Ah, I should've married Ray!
Ugh!

18:45.630 --> 18:47.797
Ray? Who's Ray?

18:47.799 --> 18:51.734
He is a Samoan guy that I dated
in high school.

18:51.736 --> 18:54.904
That dude could bend my legs
over my head.

18:54.906 --> 18:55.972
You are my hero.

18:55.974 --> 18:58.074
Lloyd would be
half Pacific Islander.

18:58.076 --> 18:59.609
Should've married Ray,
not Max.

18:59.611 --> 19:02.412
They even have
scholarships for gays.

19:02.414 --> 19:04.914
Really?

19:04.916 --> 19:07.316
You know, I can't figure out if
Lloyd is gay or straight.

19:07.318 --> 19:09.719
And can you believe he won't
talk to me about it?

19:09.721 --> 19:11.921
Would you have a problem
if he was?

19:11.923 --> 19:14.057
Are you kidding me?
I’d be thrilled!

19:14.059 --> 19:14.724
Why?

19:14.726 --> 19:15.958
Why?

19:15.960 --> 19:17.293
Because he'd be the only man

19:17.295 --> 19:18.561
who never left me for
another woman.

19:18.563 --> 19:20.329
You know how great that would be?

19:20.331 --> 19:22.165
He'd be just with me
all the time.

19:22.167 --> 19:25.802
Oh, my God. my gay son and me
going purse shopping.

19:25.804 --> 19:27.570
How great would that be?

19:27.572 --> 19:29.005
I could be walking down
the street,

19:29.007 --> 19:30.840
going to the theater
with my gay son,

19:30.842 --> 19:32.909
like, "What are you doing?"
"Oh, just going to the theater!

19:32.911 --> 19:34.811
"This is my gay son.
he's taking me to the theater!

19:34.813 --> 19:36.946
He's taking me to the opera!
I’m going to the opera with my gay son!"

19:36.948 --> 19:39.115
Just walkin'--
- I didn't even know you liked the opera.

19:39.117 --> 19:41.484
I have never been to the opera,
and I would hate it,

19:41.486 --> 19:43.152
but I would be there
with my gay son.

19:43.154 --> 19:44.587
And that would be
so great.

19:44.589 --> 19:47.290
My son's not gay.
He doesn't like pesto.

19:47.292 --> 19:49.859
Yeah, he's so not gay.

20:57.395 --> 21:00.563
Relax, man,
you're making  <i>me</i>  nervous.

21:00.565 --> 21:02.165
She's nowhere in sight.
Yeah, not yet.

21:09.274 --> 21:10.673
Lloyd, are you ready?

21:10.675 --> 21:12.441
Um, I’m really nervous.

21:12.443 --> 21:14.377
Well, I’m very proud of you
for doing this.

21:20.818 --> 21:23.186
Let's give them another round
of applause.

21:23.188 --> 21:24.720
Wasn't that amazing?

21:24.722 --> 21:27.456
Who knew we had so much talent
at this school?

21:27.458 --> 21:29.559
Next up,
you know them well --

21:29.561 --> 21:31.394
it's the girls' dance squad.

21:42.372 --> 21:43.773
Just take a breath,
you'll be fine.

21:43.775 --> 21:45.141
Your poem is beautiful.

21:45.143 --> 21:47.109
You got this.

21:47.111 --> 21:49.445
- Oh, Okay.
- Deep breaths.

22:07.731 --> 22:10.633
Okay, um,
next up we've got a poem

22:10.635 --> 22:13.502
from Mrs. Moore's English class.

22:16.674 --> 22:17.840
- You'll be fine.
- I can't.

22:17.842 --> 22:19.642
Come on!

22:22.847 --> 22:24.513
Come out here.

22:24.515 --> 22:25.815
- <i>Douche bag, come out!</i>
- He'll be fine.

22:25.817 --> 22:28.451
Hey, kid, come on.

22:28.453 --> 22:30.152
He's coming.
- <i>Sometime today.</i>

22:32.789 --> 22:34.924
- Seriously.
- Oh!

22:34.926 --> 22:37.426
Sorry! Love you!

22:37.428 --> 22:38.995
Just go up to the mic right there.

22:38.997 --> 22:41.497
<i>Hey, pretty boy!</i>

22:41.499 --> 22:44.600
Okay, okay.

22:48.940 --> 22:50.106
<i>Hey, junior.</i>

22:55.113 --> 22:56.979
- What is he doing?
- Come on, Lloyd.
- <i>Spit it out!</i>

22:56.981 --> 22:59.548
<i>Come on, Shakespeare...
show us what you got!</i>

23:05.222 --> 23:06.656
<i>Get off the stage, queer!</i>

23:11.129 --> 23:12.194
Mom?

23:13.797 --> 23:17.333
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

23:17.335 --> 23:18.834
<i>Now it's a talent show.</i>

23:18.836 --> 23:21.337
Go ahead. just take a breath.
Take a breath.

23:21.339 --> 23:23.071
- Just hold up.Just don't go anywhere.
- <i>Oh, my God, look at her gold shoes!</i>

23:23.073 --> 23:25.474
Everyone, shut up.

23:25.476 --> 23:28.511
My son is going to read a poem.
Go ahead, Lloyd.

23:28.513 --> 23:29.645
<i>Did your mom bring your bottle?!</i>

23:29.647 --> 23:30.913
Who is that?

23:30.915 --> 23:33.482
Who's that? Hmm?

23:33.484 --> 23:35.551
Oh. oh, yeah, it's you.

23:35.553 --> 23:38.187
Yeah, well, you are ruining it
for everyone, okay?

23:38.189 --> 23:39.989
Stand up, show yourself.
Let's see you.

23:39.991 --> 23:42.058
Yeah, you think it's okay
to call people names,

23:42.060 --> 23:43.326
You little turd?

23:45.596 --> 23:47.697
You think it's okay to
call people...

23:47.699 --> 23:49.732
gay?

23:49.734 --> 23:51.701
His poetry is beautiful.

23:51.703 --> 23:53.836
It's not what you people
are writing --

23:53.838 --> 23:55.371
unicorns and boners.

23:57.275 --> 23:59.041
Go to the principal's office.

23:59.043 --> 24:02.244
The principal's office?
You don't even work here.

24:02.246 --> 24:04.046
I can handle this, Mrs. Cooper!

24:04.048 --> 24:06.248
So it's only the teachers who can
give orders around here?

24:06.250 --> 24:07.350
Actually, yes.
That's true.

24:07.352 --> 24:08.851
Oh, uh, okay,
Oh, please.

24:08.853 --> 24:10.453
As if you'd treat  <i>Barbara Wolfe</i>
like this.

24:10.455 --> 24:12.254
Barbara Wolfe would be like,
"Oh, I’m gonna talk."

24:12.256 --> 24:14.190
Barbara Wolfe would not be
on stage right now.

24:14.192 --> 24:15.891
- Security!
- We don't know that for sure.

24:15.893 --> 24:18.928
- I wanna say something about poetry.
- Hey!

24:18.930 --> 24:20.296
Excuse me?
What are you doing?!

24:22.233 --> 24:24.266
Bravo!

24:28.939 --> 24:31.073
Um...

24:34.412 --> 24:37.246
Now, bailing your mother
out of jail, that's a first.

24:37.248 --> 24:39.415
Used to be
the other way around.

24:39.417 --> 24:40.416
Yeah, 17 times.

24:40.418 --> 24:42.151
17 times, what?

24:42.153 --> 24:45.087
Uh, the number of times mom
has bailed you out of jail.

24:45.089 --> 24:45.888
That many times?

24:45.890 --> 24:48.257
Yeah. That I know of.

24:48.259 --> 24:51.594
I was convicted  <i>once.</i>
Public nuisance.

24:51.596 --> 24:53.496
I mean, really, I’m a rock star.

24:53.498 --> 24:57.433
That was a long, long,
long time ago, Max.

24:57.435 --> 25:00.169
I still tour.

25:00.171 --> 25:02.438
Indian casinos.

25:03.841 --> 25:05.341
Things change.

25:05.343 --> 25:07.843
Oh, I know. I went to my first
PTA meeting last week.

25:07.845 --> 25:09.945
All right.

25:09.947 --> 25:11.580
That's pretty funny.

25:11.582 --> 25:15.284
Am I, uh...

25:15.286 --> 25:17.353
Comin' in?

25:17.355 --> 25:18.854
No jail jokes.

25:18.856 --> 25:20.689
I was just about --

25:20.691 --> 25:23.359
Oh, yeah, I saw you forming it!
Don't even!

25:23.361 --> 25:25.795
So I was thinking, like,
blond streak, black streak,

25:25.797 --> 25:27.029
blond streak, black streak.

25:27.031 --> 25:28.297
1987.

25:28.299 --> 25:30.466
What?
You loved it.

25:30.468 --> 25:32.468
- Mm.
- It was hot.

25:32.470 --> 25:34.170
1987.

25:34.172 --> 25:35.704
Doesn't matter. it's my look.
I’m gonna rock it hard.

25:35.706 --> 25:37.173
I might even do it tonight.

25:37.175 --> 25:39.375
I’m gonna do it
with my mustache bleach.

25:39.377 --> 25:41.610
Okay. Mm.
All right. I’m gonna go to bed.

25:41.612 --> 25:44.346
You guys try not to get arrested
while I’m gone, okay?

25:44.348 --> 25:45.881
Yes, Dad.

25:45.883 --> 25:46.949
Ha ha.

25:46.951 --> 25:48.417
I was just gonna say...

26:05.502 --> 26:07.069
<i>We gotta talk about Lloyd.</i>

26:07.071 --> 26:08.204
<i>Why? He's a great kid.</i>

26:08.206 --> 26:09.472
<i>He is a great kid.</i>

26:09.474 --> 26:11.507
<i>I don't know how it happened,
but...</i>

26:11.509 --> 26:14.243
<i>and...</i>

26:14.245 --> 26:16.979
our son's gay.

26:16.981 --> 26:19.882
My son...gay?

26:19.884 --> 26:21.183
Our son.

26:21.185 --> 26:22.852
Yeah, okay.
<i>Our</i>  son, gay?

26:22.854 --> 26:25.187
I don't get
the gay vibe  <i>at all</i>  from him.

26:25.189 --> 26:27.857
Well, see, I think that
is exactly what the problem is.

26:27.859 --> 26:29.859
I think that he doesn't want
to come out

26:29.861 --> 26:32.495
to his super-hetero dad
'cause he'll disappoint you.

26:33.497 --> 26:36.765
I wouldn't --
I wouldn't be disappointed.

26:36.767 --> 26:38.100
Are you sure about that?

26:38.102 --> 26:40.169
Yeah, no,
I just don't think he is.

26:40.171 --> 26:42.438
You gotta trust a mom
on this one, okay?

26:42.440 --> 26:44.039
<i>Whatever you say.</i>

26:44.041 --> 26:47.776
<i>Okay. Talk to him.
Tell him you're okay with it.</i>

26:47.778 --> 26:49.578
For 10 years you've been saying,

26:49.580 --> 26:51.413
"I don't want you to talk to him,

26:51.415 --> 26:52.681
you're a bad influence."

26:52.683 --> 26:54.416
10 years, at least!

26:54.418 --> 26:57.219
Now you want me to talk to him?

26:59.757 --> 27:03.192
Things change, okay?

27:06.062 --> 27:08.764
Okay. Okay.

27:10.200 --> 27:12.902
Now shoo. Go, go, please.

27:12.904 --> 27:14.069
Faster.

27:14.071 --> 27:15.971
Maggie?

27:15.973 --> 27:17.072
Come here, please.

27:17.074 --> 27:19.475
- Right there?
- Yes.

27:19.477 --> 27:21.377
Please.

27:21.379 --> 27:24.280
You know, I’m sorry
that I missed your scene

27:24.282 --> 27:26.715
at the arts festival the other day.

27:26.717 --> 27:28.250
Oh, you heard about me.

27:28.252 --> 27:29.552
Stop right there.
That's fine.

27:29.554 --> 27:30.953
Unfortunately, I did.

27:30.955 --> 27:33.055
It seems that you mentioned me
to Mrs. Moore?

27:33.057 --> 27:36.292
I get worked up sometimes.
Sorry.

27:36.294 --> 27:39.228
That is in the past, it is behind me,

27:39.230 --> 27:41.430
and I’m just turning over
a new leaf,

27:41.432 --> 27:44.266
and let's just move on
and do the prom stuff, okay?

27:44.268 --> 27:46.669
Mrs. Moore told me that your son
seems sensitive.

27:46.671 --> 27:50.105
Yes, he is. Sensitive.

27:50.107 --> 27:52.074
Mm, sensitive-looking.

27:52.076 --> 27:53.809
Is that code?

27:53.811 --> 27:56.312
It seems that this might be
a wonderful time for your son,

27:56.314 --> 27:58.480
who's very sensitive,
to start maybe his own club.

27:58.482 --> 28:00.249
Maybe a sensitive boys' club.

28:00.251 --> 28:01.684
Or a gay club!

28:01.686 --> 28:03.018
A gay club.

28:03.020 --> 28:04.153
What would they do there?

28:04.155 --> 28:05.421
Needlepoint.

28:05.423 --> 28:07.089
Choreography.

28:07.091 --> 28:08.524
Poetry?

28:08.526 --> 28:10.459
Anything that a seamstress
would do.

28:10.461 --> 28:12.094
I mean, sure. Why not?

28:12.096 --> 28:13.596
'Cause all the best fashion
designers are gay men,

28:13.598 --> 28:15.164
so I would love that.

28:15.166 --> 28:17.199
- He could be Marc Jacobs or
the next Michael Kors.
- That's true.

28:17.201 --> 28:18.934
He could be
on  <i>Project Runway</i>  going,

28:18.936 --> 28:20.836
"Hi, guys."
I would love it.

28:20.838 --> 28:23.305
I guess because
I’m a single mom, my son and I,

28:23.307 --> 28:24.974
we hang out a lot

28:24.976 --> 28:27.142
and we just have a really close
relationship which is --

28:27.144 --> 28:29.478
maybe it's just the way it is
with gay sons,

28:29.480 --> 28:31.447
and we're probably
just gonna have, like, a --

28:31.449 --> 28:33.449
just a great life, go off
on cruises,

28:33.451 --> 28:34.883
and I’m sure
he'll take me to Paris,

28:34.885 --> 28:36.185
and I-I’ll tell you
something else, too --

28:36.187 --> 28:37.786
I bet I’ll be
the best dressed mom

28:37.788 --> 28:39.622
in the assisted-living facility
in South Beach.

28:39.624 --> 28:41.657
He'll just park me there.
It'll be great.

28:41.659 --> 28:43.192
Should we talk about the prom,
maybe?

28:43.194 --> 28:44.627
- Yes.
- Yeah.

28:44.629 --> 28:46.028
Barbara Wolfe always feels like

28:46.030 --> 28:47.363
people who are sensitive

28:47.365 --> 28:49.365
maybe should have
their own sensitive prom.

28:49.367 --> 28:54.270
Perhaps your son should have
his own gay prom.

28:54.272 --> 28:55.938
It could be rainbow themed!

28:55.940 --> 28:57.440
- Or sparkles.
- Oh! I love sparkles.

28:57.442 --> 28:58.741
These girls have great ideas
for gays.

28:58.743 --> 29:00.075
My son's coming to this prom.

29:00.077 --> 29:02.378
He's gonna be at this prom.

29:02.380 --> 29:03.812
If he has a date.

29:03.814 --> 29:06.248
He's coming to this prom.
It's all good.

29:06.250 --> 29:08.550
Well, Maggie, good luck
with your gay son

29:08.552 --> 29:10.686
who's going to take you
to Paris.

29:10.695 --> 29:12.087
In the meantime,

29:12.089 --> 29:14.056
maybe he should talk to you
about your hair.

29:14.058 --> 29:15.391
It's so nice.

29:15.393 --> 29:17.426
Well, thank you.

29:17.428 --> 29:18.761
I wasn't complimenting you.
Girls?

29:22.500 --> 29:24.199
Ouch!

29:24.201 --> 29:25.367
Wow!

29:25.369 --> 29:27.936
Okay.

29:27.938 --> 29:30.506
What is up with that?

29:30.508 --> 29:32.174
Unbelievable.

29:32.176 --> 29:34.043
They're out for me, right?

29:34.045 --> 29:36.078
Yeah.
What are you doing?

29:36.080 --> 29:38.047
Oh, Barbara Wolfe
finally gave me a job.

29:38.049 --> 29:39.915
I get to
clean up after the meeting.

29:39.917 --> 29:41.383
Hey, I’ll see you
back at your house, right?

29:41.385 --> 29:44.086
Yes, please.  Bring booze.

29:44.088 --> 29:47.856
And a tranquilizer dart.

30:05.275 --> 30:08.277
"My name is Barbara Wolfe.

30:09.879 --> 30:12.581
"President of the world
and the PTA.

30:12.583 --> 30:14.583
"My name is Barbara Wolfe.

30:14.585 --> 30:17.619
"I do not have any veins
in my body.

30:17.621 --> 30:18.821
"My cooch is an icicle.

30:18.823 --> 30:20.622
"My name is Barbara Wolfe.

30:20.624 --> 30:23.559
I am Barbara Wolfe."
Ahh!

30:24.794 --> 30:27.062
Barbara?

30:48.318 --> 30:50.419
Congratulations.

30:50.421 --> 30:53.122
I mean, I really wish
you would've told me yourself,

30:53.124 --> 30:54.423
seriously, but congrats.

30:54.425 --> 30:55.824
What are you talking about?

30:55.826 --> 30:57.126
Your scholarship application.

30:57.128 --> 30:58.761
They posted the finalists
this morning.

30:58.763 --> 31:00.696
- What application?
- "What application?"

31:00.698 --> 31:02.698
Yeah. Come on, you big queen!

31:02.700 --> 31:04.099
- You don't have to hide
in the closet anymore.
- What?

31:04.101 --> 31:05.667
That's the point, right?

31:05.669 --> 31:07.803
I’m pretty confused by
your whole -- your whole thing.

31:07.805 --> 31:09.204
I don't...

31:09.206 --> 31:10.939
Y-you can't keep
playing it coy, man.

31:10.941 --> 31:12.207
I don't know what this --
what are you talking about?

31:12.209 --> 31:13.609
They posted it.
Posted what?

31:17.114 --> 31:18.981
God, she's trying to get me
killed. Oh, my God.

31:18.983 --> 31:20.449
What?

31:20.451 --> 31:21.950
There he is!

31:21.952 --> 31:23.819
Lloyd, come on up here!
- What?

31:23.821 --> 31:24.720
Come on!

31:24.722 --> 31:25.854
I-I think they want you

31:25.856 --> 31:27.156
to be in -- in Prom Court!

31:27.158 --> 31:28.657
- Let's look at you.
- No, no, no, no, no.

31:28.659 --> 31:29.892
- You look great. This is great.
- Help! No!

31:29.894 --> 31:32.661
It's 2014!
Being gay is cool now!

31:32.663 --> 31:35.030
I am so proud to welcome

31:35.032 --> 31:37.499
our very first
openly gay candidate, Lloyd --

31:37.501 --> 31:38.734
what's your last name?

31:38.736 --> 31:40.035
Uh, C-C-Cooper.

31:40.037 --> 31:41.303
Lloyd Cooper!

32:02.658 --> 32:04.593
Hi.

32:04.595 --> 32:06.762
Hey.
How was your day?

32:06.764 --> 32:08.163
- Seriously, Mom?
- What?

32:08.165 --> 32:11.166
- Don't play innocent.
- I don't know what you mean.

32:11.168 --> 32:13.535
- Prom Courts?
- Yeah.

32:13.537 --> 32:15.537
Mom, most of the people
at this school,

32:15.539 --> 32:16.605
they don't even know who I am.

32:16.607 --> 32:18.207
They do now.

32:18.209 --> 32:20.042
Also, thanks for
telling the whole school I’m gay.

32:20.044 --> 32:22.578
Well, I just figured.
Come on, you and Fitch.

32:22.580 --> 32:24.947
Me and F--
What?! Fitch?!

32:24.949 --> 32:26.215
He's your only friend.

32:26.217 --> 32:28.016
So we're gay?
Yeah?

32:28.018 --> 32:30.786
I don't have a boyfriend.
I don't have a girlfriend.

32:30.788 --> 32:33.121
All I have is this...

32:33.123 --> 32:34.623
crazy mom.

32:34.625 --> 32:36.892
That's all I have.

32:42.066 --> 32:43.298
All right, next?

32:43.600 --> 32:44.933
Hey.

32:44.935 --> 32:46.568
Yes, you, Lloyd.

32:46.570 --> 32:48.237
Oh, come here.

32:48.239 --> 32:49.938
Fix that.

32:49.940 --> 32:51.473
There you go.

32:51.475 --> 32:52.741
Thanks.

32:52.743 --> 32:54.409
Having fun?

32:54.411 --> 32:57.279
No, not really.
This isn't really my thing.

32:57.281 --> 32:59.081
Yeah.
It's a shit show.

32:59.083 --> 33:00.449
Excuse me?

33:00.451 --> 33:01.617
Oh, I mean, come on.

33:01.619 --> 33:03.552
Prom Court, Winter Formal Court,
Sadie's, Morp --

33:03.554 --> 33:05.153
it's all the same
boring pageant.

33:05.155 --> 33:07.589
You're not like the other girls,
if I’m not mistaken.

33:07.591 --> 33:09.124
No.

33:09.126 --> 33:10.993
I can't wait for this one
to be done.

33:10.995 --> 33:13.061
Then finally my crazy mom
might calm down.

33:13.063 --> 33:14.329
I know what you mean there.

33:14.331 --> 33:16.431
My mom had a full-on
anxiety attack,

33:16.433 --> 33:17.499
Wouldn't admit it.

33:17.501 --> 33:19.301
My mom hates your mom.

33:19.303 --> 33:20.936
I can't say I blame her
for that.

33:20.938 --> 33:23.472
My mom has what I like to call
a "polarizing" personality,

33:23.474 --> 33:25.107
which really is just a nice way

33:25.109 --> 33:26.808
of saying she's probably bipolar.

33:26.810 --> 33:28.610
oh.
It's not funny.

33:28.612 --> 33:29.945
No, no, of course not.

33:29.947 --> 33:32.281
But if it makes you feel
any better...

33:32.283 --> 33:35.517
anyone who manages to piss off
my mom is good in my book.

33:35.519 --> 33:36.852
All right.

33:36.854 --> 33:38.287
All right, ladies and gentlemen,

33:38.289 --> 33:39.621
should we get this over with?

33:39.623 --> 33:40.856
Yes, please.

33:40.858 --> 33:42.925
Try not to take this all
so seriously.

33:42.927 --> 33:45.193
I’ll try.

33:45.195 --> 33:47.529
And don't be afraid to say hi
to me on campus.

33:47.531 --> 33:49.698
We're friends now.
Come on.

33:49.700 --> 33:51.433
Great.

33:51.435 --> 33:53.568
Try to look like
you're enjoying yourselves.

34:15.326 --> 34:18.560
Hey.

34:18.562 --> 34:20.862
Hey.
What are you doing here?

34:20.864 --> 34:22.731
You asked me to talk to him.

34:22.733 --> 34:25.467
I like the red!

34:25.469 --> 34:29.204
Right?
I look great, right?

34:29.206 --> 34:30.371
I like it.

34:30.373 --> 34:31.672
What are you doing?
Get --

34:31.675 --> 34:33.641
Wow!
Okay, all ri--

34:33.643 --> 34:35.978
Okay. Oh, don't...

34:35.980 --> 34:37.346
Why not?

34:37.348 --> 34:39.081
Okay, that's good.
That is so good.

34:39.083 --> 34:41.917
Yeah, it is so -- so soft.

34:41.918 --> 34:43.685
Oh, my God.

34:43.687 --> 34:45.587
Okay, all right. come here,
I’m gonna show you something.

34:45.589 --> 34:46.855
Cut it out!

34:46.857 --> 34:48.556
Ready?

34:48.559 --> 34:50.025
Yeah, I’m ready.

34:50.027 --> 34:51.259
This!

34:54.031 --> 34:56.098
It's a nice picture.
Yeah.

34:56.100 --> 34:57.699
Now I need some hobbies so...

34:57.701 --> 34:59.901
so he doesn't seem like
such a nerd.

34:59.903 --> 35:02.037
Like reading and TV,
what else does he --

35:02.039 --> 35:03.672
What are you doing?

35:03.674 --> 35:06.441
I’m creating a profile so he
doesn't go to prom alone.

35:06.443 --> 35:08.610
you're creating a fake profile

35:08.612 --> 35:10.278
to procure young men online
for Lloyd?

35:10.280 --> 35:11.613
Kinda, yeah.

35:11.615 --> 35:13.515
What -- have you seen
<i>To Catch a Predator</i> ?

35:13.517 --> 35:15.884
It's not a fake profile if
you know the person.

35:15.886 --> 35:17.519
I’m just gonna go through
the best ones

35:17.521 --> 35:19.187
and just pick some guys
that could go --

35:19.189 --> 35:22.691
Okay, don't tell him.

35:22.693 --> 35:24.926
It just seems wrong.

35:24.928 --> 35:26.828
Hey, it's not that wrong.

35:29.232 --> 35:31.299
I’m gonna go talk to him.

35:33.537 --> 35:34.636
- Knock Knock!
- Yeah?

35:34.638 --> 35:36.038
Had dinner?

35:36.040 --> 35:37.773
- Yeah.
- Perfect.

35:37.775 --> 35:40.909
Let's go out
for after-dinner drinks.

35:40.911 --> 35:42.778
You know I’m 17, right?

35:42.780 --> 35:45.747
If my son's nearly old enough
to be shipped off to war,

35:45.749 --> 35:47.716
he can have a drink with his dad.

35:47.718 --> 35:49.885
Come on, let's go.
I know a place.

35:54.625 --> 35:57.926
Ah, Christy.
Good evening.

35:57.928 --> 35:59.961
Whiskey for me...

35:59.963 --> 36:01.163
and one for Lloyd.

36:01.165 --> 36:02.431
Ooh.

36:02.433 --> 36:03.598
We gonna do shots?

36:03.600 --> 36:04.966
Yeah.

36:04.968 --> 36:07.335
You know I don't drink, right?

36:07.337 --> 36:08.970
Well, now you will.

36:08.972 --> 36:11.106
Be a naughty boy tonight.

36:11.108 --> 36:14.276
Yeah, this is, uh -- this is
the first one, actually.

36:14.278 --> 36:16.578
This is your first drink?

36:16.580 --> 36:18.447
Yep.

36:18.449 --> 36:19.815
Well, there's always
gotta be a first.

36:19.817 --> 36:21.083
Sure.

36:21.085 --> 36:23.652
- Bottoms up, cowboys!
- All right.

36:23.654 --> 36:25.821
Thank you, cowgirl.

36:25.823 --> 36:27.756
All right.

36:29.992 --> 36:32.194
Mmm!

36:32.196 --> 36:33.662
Ahh.
That's a good start.

36:33.664 --> 36:35.163
Whoo!

36:35.165 --> 36:37.032
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

36:37.034 --> 36:39.000
- You drank the whole thing?
- Come on!

36:39.002 --> 36:41.970
Okay. All right, okay.
All right.

36:41.972 --> 36:45.674
We are not leaving this bar
until you are nice and drunk.

36:45.676 --> 36:47.776
Whoo!

36:47.778 --> 36:49.144
Another one for me.

36:49.146 --> 36:51.279
You're going for another?
Oh, my God!

36:51.281 --> 36:52.714
And we are gonna talk...

36:52.716 --> 36:55.117
and drink,

36:55.119 --> 36:58.620
and you are gonna love it,
God damn it.

36:58.622 --> 37:00.889
Be right back.
All right.

37:00.891 --> 37:04.359
Um...

37:04.361 --> 37:05.627
Uh, excuse me, Miss?

37:05.629 --> 37:08.830
you can call me Christy, darlin'.

37:08.832 --> 37:12.134
Okay, uh, Christy,
when you poor our shots,

37:12.136 --> 37:14.302
can you water mine down?

37:14.304 --> 37:16.004
Aw, okay.

37:16.006 --> 37:19.141
Like, maybe all water?

37:19.143 --> 37:21.042
Okay, honey.
Please?

37:21.044 --> 37:22.811
Thank you.

37:24.314 --> 37:27.415
- So...
- So...

37:27.417 --> 37:29.985
...give Dad the 411.

37:29.987 --> 37:31.887
Nobody says 411 anymore, Dad,

37:31.889 --> 37:34.022
unless they're on Disney Channel.

37:34.024 --> 37:36.925
All right, current events.

37:36.927 --> 37:38.527
Fill me in.

37:38.529 --> 37:41.696
Love, life, pursuit of happiness.

37:41.698 --> 37:45.767
Well, steady as she goes,
I guess.

37:45.769 --> 37:49.371
That's it?
That's all you're giving me?

37:49.373 --> 37:50.906
Come on
you can talk about anything!

37:50.908 --> 37:53.375
You can talk about,
you know...

37:53.377 --> 37:56.545
school, friends, graduation,

37:56.547 --> 37:58.580
love life...

37:58.582 --> 38:00.048
boyfriends.

38:00.050 --> 38:01.383
God, you too?

38:01.385 --> 38:03.351
Did Mom put you up to this
or something?

38:03.353 --> 38:06.188
No. Absolutely no.

38:06.190 --> 38:07.589
Good.

38:07.591 --> 38:08.924
But, if you're uncomfortable...

38:08.926 --> 38:10.525
No, it's n-- I’m not --

38:10.527 --> 38:12.027
Ho, really, you don't have
to talk about it.

38:12.029 --> 38:13.628
I’m not uncomfortable
talking about it,

38:13.630 --> 38:15.130
I just -- I hate everybody trying
to put a label on me.

38:15.132 --> 38:17.032
Can I just be undeclared?

38:17.034 --> 38:21.303
Just you and me.

38:21.305 --> 38:27.876
Just...nothing you say will
ever be repeated.

38:29.111 --> 38:30.545
You do have a question.

38:30.547 --> 38:31.947
Uh...

38:31.949 --> 38:34.616
Spit 'em.

38:34.618 --> 38:37.118
How did you know you were straight?

38:37.120 --> 38:40.055
Well, that's a good question.

38:43.126 --> 38:47.495
I guess I just knew.

38:47.497 --> 38:50.432
Did you ever experiment or anything?

38:50.434 --> 38:53.902
Guys hit on me all the time.
I mean, for years.

38:53.904 --> 38:55.470
- Really?
- Yeah.

38:55.472 --> 38:58.740
I mean, I -- you know,
I kissed a guy once,

38:58.742 --> 39:01.243
and he followed me into the bathroom.
- Really?

39:01.245 --> 39:03.411
I mean, I don't know,
but nothing really happened,

39:03.413 --> 39:04.846
You know?
Nothing really...

39:04.848 --> 39:07.782
but enough to know you
don't like it.

39:07.784 --> 39:09.618
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

39:09.620 --> 39:13.855
I guess I just wasn't really
attracted to guys.

39:13.857 --> 39:16.658
Can I ask you a personal question?

39:16.660 --> 39:18.426
What gives you a boner?

39:18.428 --> 39:22.430
Dad, I’m 17.
Everything gives me a boner.

39:22.432 --> 39:25.433
A slight change in the weather
gives me a boner.

39:25.435 --> 39:27.035
Calculus gives me a boner.

39:27.037 --> 39:29.104
I’m not kidding!

39:29.106 --> 39:31.773
You are my son after all.

39:31.775 --> 39:33.475
- Not really, not quite, no.
- Yes, you are! yes!

39:33.477 --> 39:36.478
- I’m -- I’m a virgin.
- Yeah.

39:36.480 --> 39:38.380
Well, I knew that.
I sort of guessed that.

39:38.382 --> 39:41.816
Never even been kissed --
boy  <i>or</i>  girl.

39:41.818 --> 39:44.019
No.  Nothin'.

39:44.021 --> 39:45.553
Oh, my God.

39:45.555 --> 39:49.624
By your age, I mean, Jesus.

39:49.626 --> 39:51.159
Maybe I’m just young and idealistic,

39:51.161 --> 39:54.362
but I-I think it should mean...
something.

39:54.364 --> 39:57.899
I mean, I th-- there's maybe
three people I can think of

39:57.901 --> 40:00.235
that I would even contemplate
sleeping with

40:00.237 --> 40:04.973
who are ni-- nice people,
attractive physically,

40:04.975 --> 40:06.708
and, yeah, one of them
happens to be a guy,

40:06.710 --> 40:08.076
but that doesn't mean I’m ready

40:08.078 --> 40:09.711
to jump into bed with him
right away.

40:09.713 --> 40:14.983
I don't kno-- I don't know!
I don't know.

40:14.985 --> 40:19.654
All right. cool.

40:19.656 --> 40:21.723
You're fine.

40:21.725 --> 40:25.593
Just relax, take your time.

40:25.595 --> 40:27.362
You'll figure it out.

40:27.364 --> 40:29.931
No matter what you do or say,

40:29.933 --> 40:32.734
You're not gonna change
my feelings about you.

40:32.736 --> 40:36.171
And I’ve done some bad, terrible,

40:36.173 --> 40:39.507
irresponsible things in my life,

40:39.509 --> 40:42.677
and I-I’m not in a position
to judge anyone else,

40:42.679 --> 40:45.880
least of all my son --

40:45.882 --> 40:50.518
of who I am very, very proud,
by the way.

40:50.520 --> 40:55.824
Thanks, Dad.
That's...really good to hear.

41:24.787 --> 41:27.389
Yes! Mom!

41:27.391 --> 41:29.324
- I’m in here!
- Mom, Mom, Mom, come here!

41:29.326 --> 41:30.759
Yahoo!

41:30.761 --> 41:32.060
Look!
Look, look, look, look!

41:32.062 --> 41:33.328
What are you doing?

41:33.330 --> 41:34.462
Look, look, look!
It's here!

41:34.464 --> 41:35.463
What is that?
Read it.

41:35.465 --> 41:36.598
Right?

41:36.600 --> 41:38.566
My God!

41:38.568 --> 41:40.168
Yeah, you did!

41:40.170 --> 41:42.003
We have a good chance
at the scholarship, right?

41:42.005 --> 41:44.773
Of course. yes.
Yeah, we'll make it work.
Yes. oh, God!

41:44.775 --> 41:46.107
Oh, I’m so proud of you!

41:46.109 --> 41:47.409
Oh, I need to get you
some luggage!

41:47.411 --> 41:48.943
I love you! I love you.
All right?

41:48.945 --> 41:50.912
I love you, too.
Oh, I love you so much!

41:50.914 --> 41:52.814
I love you so much! I’m so proud!
Yeah!

41:52.816 --> 41:54.249
So proud!

42:00.756 --> 42:02.357
So that's it.
That's his college,

42:02.359 --> 42:04.526
and you gotta trust me,
and you can't get weird.

42:04.528 --> 42:07.095
just go with what I do.
It's gonna be fun!

42:07.097 --> 42:08.797
Is there booze in here?

42:08.799 --> 42:10.465
Hi! welcome to Tin Horn Flats.
How many?

42:10.467 --> 42:12.000
Oh, table for four, please.

42:12.002 --> 42:13.268
- You got it.
- Three.

42:13.270 --> 42:15.770
- Right this way.
- We're actually four.

42:15.772 --> 42:18.973
What? no. Who?
What? Who's the fourth?

42:18.975 --> 42:21.142
Just...nothin'.
We have four people tonight.

42:21.144 --> 42:22.277
Maggie...

42:22.279 --> 42:24.279
Who's the fourth?

42:24.281 --> 42:25.547
Just a friend.

42:25.549 --> 42:26.714
Who?

42:26.716 --> 42:28.616
They stack onion rings here.

42:28.618 --> 42:30.385
- Hey.
- Hi.

42:30.387 --> 42:32.287
Aww, my future East Coast resident.

42:32.289 --> 42:33.488
- Howdy.
- Hi.

42:33.490 --> 42:35.790
Hi. would you like me
to wait for your whole party

42:35.792 --> 42:37.559
to arrive
before I take your order?

42:37.561 --> 42:38.626
Well, why don't we just get
some onion rings?

42:38.628 --> 42:39.994
The big tall stack of them,

42:39.996 --> 42:42.530
and, um, could you get me
a margarita?

42:42.532 --> 42:43.832
a, just -- do you have,
uh, two sizes?

42:43.834 --> 42:45.300
- Yeah.
- Okay, I’ll have the venti.

42:45.302 --> 42:47.302
The large.
Yeah. Thank you.

42:47.304 --> 42:48.703
Got it, right away.

42:48.705 --> 42:49.904
Is there someone else coming?

42:49.906 --> 42:51.506
Just a friend is coming to join us.

42:51.508 --> 42:52.807
Yeah, and I just wanna say

42:52.809 --> 42:54.409
that I didn't have anything
to do

42:54.411 --> 42:56.377
with orchestrating the events
that are about to occur.

42:56.379 --> 42:59.714
I just came here to celebrate
you getting into NYU.

42:59.716 --> 43:02.217
Maggie, hello, darling.
You must be dad.

43:02.219 --> 43:04.652
And this must be Lloyd.

43:04.654 --> 43:06.654
Hello.
Yeah, hi.

43:06.656 --> 43:07.722
Parker.
Lovely to meet you.

43:07.724 --> 43:09.257
Hi, Parker.

43:09.259 --> 43:11.659
Do you wanna ask, um, Parker

43:11.661 --> 43:14.429
about, uh,
where he goes to school

43:14.431 --> 43:16.831
or, um, who cuts his hair?

43:18.068 --> 43:19.434
well, I go to FiDM,

43:19.436 --> 43:21.836
and I get my hair cut
at Chop Chop Salon.

43:21.838 --> 43:23.404
What about you?

43:23.406 --> 43:24.839
Um...

43:24.841 --> 43:27.342
I cut his hair.

43:27.344 --> 43:29.844
Oh!
That's nice.

43:29.846 --> 43:31.346
On Friday, he did his own bangs.

43:32.849 --> 43:34.349
All right. Um, well,

43:34.351 --> 43:35.750
I think I’m just gonna head over
to the restroom

43:35.752 --> 43:37.385
and wash my hands
before we have dinner.

43:37.387 --> 43:38.453
But you're coming back, right?

43:38.455 --> 43:39.854
Sure, mm-hmm.

43:41.223 --> 43:42.957
Is this some kind of fix-up date?

43:42.959 --> 43:46.294
No, it is just
a gathering of friends.

43:46.296 --> 43:47.462
That's it.

43:47.464 --> 43:48.796
No. I’m out of here.
No!

43:48.798 --> 43:50.298
You can make up whatever
excuse you want,

43:50.300 --> 43:51.699
I’m leaving.
I’ll see you later, Dad.

43:51.701 --> 43:53.101
Lloyd, please, just a second!

43:53.103 --> 43:55.904
Lloyd, scholarship, please!
The scholarship.

43:55.906 --> 43:57.972
Just come here.

43:57.974 --> 43:59.307
Just come here.

43:59.309 --> 44:01.442
The scholarship rep

44:01.444 --> 44:04.212
is going to ask you questions
about your gay experience.

44:04.214 --> 44:07.415
I mean, do you even have
any gay friends?

44:07.417 --> 44:10.585
You've got to know something
about the gay lifestyle.

44:10.587 --> 44:14.589
Parker, I’m sure, is filled
with lots of insights.

44:14.591 --> 44:15.623
Please, will you sit, please?

44:15.625 --> 44:17.125
Just sit down.

44:20.430 --> 44:22.230
All right.

44:24.800 --> 44:27.068
How bad could it get, right?

44:27.070 --> 44:30.738
I have  <i>no</i>  idea what came over
Mitchell the other day.

44:30.740 --> 44:32.740
I mean, it's not like
we're even seriously dating.

44:32.742 --> 44:34.976
It's not my fault he likes
to buy me expensive things, okay?

44:34.978 --> 44:36.644
I mean, I feel like
I’m a pretty chill guy.

44:36.646 --> 44:38.646
so then I just said to myself,
"Parker,

44:38.648 --> 44:40.982
"what are you so afraid of?

44:40.984 --> 44:43.284
"guys are such drama queens.

44:43.286 --> 44:45.820
take a deep breath,"
And I just said,

44:45.822 --> 44:47.288
"chop it all off.

44:47.290 --> 44:48.923
Just chop this nappy weave
right off my head."

44:48.925 --> 44:50.425
I’m really easygoing.

44:50.427 --> 44:52.093
I’m all about
the low-maintenance, you know?

44:52.095 --> 44:53.461
Yeah, you see-- you seem
very low-maintenance.

44:53.463 --> 44:56.164
That is so cute, how awkward he is!

44:56.166 --> 44:57.665
Aw!

44:57.667 --> 44:59.033
If you need any support

44:59.035 --> 45:01.369
or advice,
I’m here for you.

45:01.371 --> 45:03.671
I’m into
really masculine guys,

45:03.673 --> 45:05.473
like,  <i>really</i>  manly guys.

45:05.475 --> 45:07.308
Really manly guys.

45:07.310 --> 45:08.509
Like, if I wanted to date
a girl, I would.

45:08.511 --> 45:10.211
Every once in a while,

45:10.213 --> 45:11.713
I find myself attracted

45:11.715 --> 45:14.515
to somebody a little bit
more... androgynous.

45:14.517 --> 45:16.284
Oh, Jesus!

45:16.286 --> 45:17.385
Dad!
My God!

45:17.387 --> 45:19.554
Really?
I don't know.

45:19.556 --> 45:21.155
I- he better go to the bathroom.

45:21.157 --> 45:22.223
Yeah.

45:22.225 --> 45:24.158
I’ll help him.

45:24.160 --> 45:25.693
Geez.

45:25.695 --> 45:27.061
Oh, my God, I had no idea

45:27.063 --> 45:28.496
how else to get you out
of that thing.

45:28.498 --> 45:30.164
You could've just asked me
to excuse myself.

45:30.166 --> 45:32.800
Well, okay, maybe that would've
been a good idea back then,

45:32.802 --> 45:34.002
but I didn't do that.

45:34.004 --> 45:36.504
So there. Here.
Thanks.

45:36.506 --> 45:39.207
"Hi, Parker." "Who are you?"
"I’m Parker."

45:39.209 --> 45:41.042
Ooh-ooh-ooh!

45:41.044 --> 45:43.211
I feel dumber for having sat
through that whole thing.

45:43.213 --> 45:44.679
My God, she's insane!

45:44.681 --> 45:47.081
This is beautiful.
maybe I should take it.

45:47.083 --> 45:49.350
Come on, be serious.
What are we gonna do?

45:49.352 --> 45:51.085
You wanna get out of here?

45:51.087 --> 45:53.888
Yeah! But if we tried anything,
she'd handcuff us to the booth.

45:53.890 --> 45:57.158
Just how desperately do you
wanna get out of here?

45:59.895 --> 46:01.262
What's going on?

46:01.264 --> 46:02.497
Are you choking?
Are you okay?

46:02.499 --> 46:04.198
Oh, my God.
Need the Heimlich?

46:04.200 --> 46:06.434
- He can speak!
- What?
- The burger?

46:06.436 --> 46:07.268
Pineapple!

46:07.270 --> 46:08.269
Pineapple?
So?

46:08.271 --> 46:10.271
He's allergic to pineapple!

46:10.273 --> 46:11.839
He's not allergic to pineapple!

46:11.841 --> 46:13.207
I better take him to
the hospital.

46:13.209 --> 46:15.343
Oh, man. I’ll rush him to
the hospital.

46:15.345 --> 46:16.744
Right.

46:16.746 --> 46:18.713
This is bad!
I’ll call you.

46:21.351 --> 46:22.950
Oh, my God!

46:26.056 --> 46:27.622
Thanks for getting me out of that.

46:27.624 --> 46:30.291
Don't kid yourself,
you owe me $2.50.

46:30.293 --> 46:31.959
Wh-- for getting me out
of the date?

46:31.961 --> 46:34.462
And interest. You were eyeing
the steak knife.

46:34.464 --> 46:35.797
Yeah, I know. I just --

46:35.799 --> 46:37.398
I thought she knew me better
than that.

46:37.400 --> 46:39.434
Wrong again.

46:39.436 --> 46:40.935
Hey you!
Hey!

46:40.937 --> 46:43.137
Fancy seeing  <i>you</i>  here.

46:43.139 --> 46:45.039
Hey, uh, Carrie,
this is my Dad, Max.

46:45.041 --> 46:46.207
Hi, nice to meet you.

46:46.209 --> 46:47.375
Nice to meet you.

46:47.377 --> 46:48.710
Damn, you got a hot dad, Lloyd.

46:48.712 --> 46:50.478
That's... not weird at all.

46:50.480 --> 46:52.980
I just mean I can see where you
get your good looks from.

46:52.982 --> 46:54.415
Ah.

46:54.417 --> 46:56.317
The girls and I were just
headed to the bar.

46:56.319 --> 46:58.619
Why?
Peggy knows the bartender.

46:58.621 --> 47:00.621
We were gonna flirt with him,
try to get some free drinks.

47:00.623 --> 47:01.789
Does that really work?

47:01.791 --> 47:03.391
Lloyd.
Come on!

47:03.393 --> 47:05.560
A group of pretty girls?
It's not that hard.

47:05.562 --> 47:07.628
Oh, all right.
Do you wanna come with us?

47:07.630 --> 47:09.430
No, I’m actually --

47:09.432 --> 47:11.833
I’m gonna hang out
with my dad tonight.

47:11.835 --> 47:14.268
Oh, okay. well, uh,
if you wanna join,

47:14.270 --> 47:17.472
we'll be over there getting drunk,

47:17.474 --> 47:19.741
so stop by, maybe?

47:19.743 --> 47:21.642
Maybe.

47:21.644 --> 47:23.344
Okay. think about it.
All right.

47:23.346 --> 47:24.812
Bye, Lloyd.
Nice to meet you, dad.

47:24.814 --> 47:25.813
Nice to meet you.

47:25.815 --> 47:27.648
Bye, Carrie.

47:27.650 --> 47:28.950
<i>He's really cute.</i>

47:28.952 --> 47:30.852
You sure?

47:30.854 --> 47:32.787
Yeah, it's fine.
I’ll see her at school.

47:32.789 --> 47:34.155
She's hot.

47:34.157 --> 47:36.157
Dad, come on.
What?

47:36.159 --> 47:38.526
It's a little creepy.

47:38.528 --> 47:41.462
Not -- it's not about me,
it's all about you.

47:41.464 --> 47:43.364
Eyes only for you.

47:43.366 --> 47:45.099
Oh, come on.

47:45.101 --> 47:47.368
Yeah.
No!

47:47.370 --> 47:48.636
The way she looked at you,

47:48.638 --> 47:50.671
she touched you.

47:50.673 --> 47:52.273
Okay, so?

47:52.275 --> 47:54.509
No, a-a casual touch by a girl
is never by accident.

47:54.511 --> 47:56.778
You're crazy.
I am not crazy.

47:56.780 --> 47:59.814
You think I don't know girls?
I’m pretty good with the girls.

47:59.816 --> 48:01.783
Are you trying
to straighten me out?

48:01.785 --> 48:03.985
No.

48:03.987 --> 48:05.787
I’m just, maybe, helping you

48:05.789 --> 48:08.656
become a more complete version
of yourself.

48:08.658 --> 48:10.224
Can we get out of here?

48:10.226 --> 48:12.293
Yeah. You wanna go home?

48:12.295 --> 48:15.062
No! I don't wanna go home,
anywhere but home.

48:24.640 --> 48:27.208
Wow.

48:27.210 --> 48:29.544
I love coming back here, son.

48:29.546 --> 48:31.846
- Mm.
- It's been a long time.

48:31.848 --> 48:35.016
Used to smoke weed back there
in between periods.

48:35.018 --> 48:37.351
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

48:37.353 --> 48:39.086
I’ll ditch class sometimes.

48:39.088 --> 48:41.989
I’ll sit at
the bench by the soccer fields.

48:41.991 --> 48:43.524
You ditch class?

48:43.526 --> 48:45.259
- Yeah.
- I read, but, yeah.

48:45.261 --> 48:46.894
- Really?
- Yeah.

48:46.896 --> 48:49.097
Oh, wow, this is where
your mother would eat lunch

48:49.099 --> 48:50.731
with her friends every day.

48:50.733 --> 48:52.066
Huh.

48:52.068 --> 48:53.935
That, right there, is the tree

48:53.937 --> 48:56.003
you sit under if you wanna get
pooped on by squirrels.

48:56.005 --> 48:58.105
Well, that's kinda what it was like,

48:58.107 --> 48:59.574
Uh, romancing your mother.

49:02.178 --> 49:04.111
What's the meanest thing
you ever did in high school?

49:04.113 --> 49:06.848
Isn't everybody a jerk
in high school?

49:06.850 --> 49:10.284
Being mean, it somehow equates
with being cool.

49:12.387 --> 49:14.922
Everybody's so lost and stupid.

49:14.924 --> 49:17.258
You think we would've been
friends in high school?

49:17.260 --> 49:18.860
You and me?

49:18.862 --> 49:20.895
Yeah. Be honest.

49:20.897 --> 49:22.530
Probably not, huh?

49:22.532 --> 49:23.865
Yeah,
I don't think so, either.

49:23.867 --> 49:25.466
Well, I was just such a jerk,
you know?

49:25.468 --> 49:29.871
I wouldn't even have deserved
to be your friend.

49:29.873 --> 49:31.472
It's okay.

49:31.474 --> 49:33.274
I’m not offended that you
wouldn't have been

49:33.276 --> 49:34.609
my hypothetical friend.

49:34.811 --> 49:38.045
Don't make a joke about it.
I’m serious.

49:38.047 --> 49:41.415
You're a much better person
than I was in high school.

49:41.417 --> 49:44.151
You're more thoughtful.
You're more mature.

49:44.153 --> 49:47.221
Hell, you're a better person
than I am as an adult.

49:47.223 --> 49:50.324
And you really ought to
stop being self-deprecating.

49:50.326 --> 49:52.460
You just use it as armor.

49:52.462 --> 49:54.929
I-I’m sorry. I didn't mean to
get you all worked up.

49:58.501 --> 50:02.136
You know...

50:02.138 --> 50:04.171
Could you do me a favor?

50:04.173 --> 50:09.076
The next time somebody
opens up to you,

50:09.078 --> 50:12.113
don't think about their intentions...

50:12.115 --> 50:17.285
or where it may be going or
how it might end.

50:17.287 --> 50:20.254
Even though you might be
embarrassed by it,

50:20.256 --> 50:24.125
just put yourself out there.

50:24.127 --> 50:27.828
You know, you really
are a person worth knowing.

50:27.830 --> 50:29.797
You really are.

50:29.799 --> 50:31.832
Mm.

50:31.834 --> 50:34.201
Yeah.

50:46.782 --> 50:48.316
He's not here yet, huh?

50:48.318 --> 50:50.217
What?
How did you find me?

50:50.219 --> 50:52.019
What? I’m your mother.
I know where you are at all times.

50:52.021 --> 50:53.220
I’d love to tell you to leave,

50:53.222 --> 50:54.455
but I know that you won't,

50:54.457 --> 50:56.557
so, please,
just stay quiet, okay?

50:56.559 --> 50:58.225
Don't get involved. Please?

50:58.227 --> 50:59.727
- Yes, I will.
- Thank you.

50:59.729 --> 51:01.395
Okay. Don't forget you're 
in the choir,

51:01.397 --> 51:04.899
and you're a huge, essential part of
this entire high school.

51:04.901 --> 51:07.001
And if there's a hell,
I’ll be going there for this.

51:07.003 --> 51:08.502
- Listen to me.
- Huh?

51:08.504 --> 51:11.305
You're in the homestretch, okay?

51:11.307 --> 51:13.140
Your grades got you here.

51:13.142 --> 51:15.843
You just have to convince Derek
of your exemplary character.

51:15.845 --> 51:17.845
Yes, yes.  <i>I do.
I</i>  have to convince him.

51:17.847 --> 51:19.080
- Yes.
- <i>Not we, me.</i>

51:19.082 --> 51:20.748
Okay. All right.
Okay.

51:20.750 --> 51:22.049
So then have you thought about
what you're gonna say

51:22.051 --> 51:23.150
about your experiences
as a gay man?

51:23.152 --> 51:25.586
Lloyd?
Yes!

51:25.588 --> 51:27.521
Yes. Uh, thank you, ma'am,
that's all the help I’ll need.

51:27.523 --> 51:28.255
Don't call me ma'am.

51:28.257 --> 51:29.557
Hi.

51:29.559 --> 51:30.758
Hi, I’m Derek
from the Point Foundation.

51:30.760 --> 51:31.993
Hi, it's nice to meet you.

51:31.995 --> 51:33.228
So, what is it like
growing up

51:33.230 --> 51:36.197
out and gay in Venice?

51:36.199 --> 51:39.066
Uh, sorry, what?

51:39.068 --> 51:40.568
How do kids here treat you

51:40.570 --> 51:43.170
when they know you're gay
and open about it?

51:43.172 --> 51:44.739
Um...

51:44.741 --> 51:47.575
well, I don-- I don't know
if it's just that I’m,

51:47.577 --> 51:48.876
um, a shy personality

51:48.878 --> 51:50.444
or if it's this
defense mechanism

51:50.446 --> 51:53.080
but, uh,
I’ve survived school

51:53.082 --> 51:57.051
by not putting myself
in uncomfortable situations.

51:57.053 --> 51:59.887
Um, it's --
it's only been recently that I’ve,

51:59.889 --> 52:02.356
uh, really let people
get to know me,

52:02.358 --> 52:05.726
You know, p-put myself out there
to be judged.

52:05.728 --> 52:09.797
Um, it's scary, you know,

52:09.799 --> 52:12.099
it's really scary,
but, uh,

52:12.101 --> 52:14.368
I’ve been really surprised

52:14.370 --> 52:17.571
by the inherent kindness
in people.

52:17.573 --> 52:19.140
That's wonderful.

52:19.142 --> 52:21.709
To see a young person who
knows who they are

52:21.711 --> 52:23.611
and can speak proudly
about it.

52:23.613 --> 52:25.379
That's exactly the type
of person

52:25.381 --> 52:27.081
our scholarship is seeking out.

52:27.083 --> 52:29.550
All that's left is a visit to
your administrators,

52:29.552 --> 52:32.053
just to learn about
your leadership skills,

52:32.055 --> 52:33.821
and we'd like to get an idea

52:33.823 --> 52:36.290
of what your fellow students
think of you.

52:36.292 --> 52:37.558
My -- my fellow students?

52:37.560 --> 52:39.060
I shouldn't be telling you this,

52:39.062 --> 52:42.096
but you're looking pretty good
for the scholarship.

52:42.098 --> 52:44.999
That's great.  Thank you.

52:45.001 --> 52:47.134
So, what upcoming events
are there?

52:47.136 --> 52:49.837
Well, um...

52:49.839 --> 52:53.474
I suppose...

52:53.476 --> 52:55.976
prom!

52:59.348 --> 53:00.481
Hello.

53:00.483 --> 53:01.649
Hi.

53:01.651 --> 53:02.983
I’m Lloyd's mom.

53:02.985 --> 53:04.118
Oh!

53:04.120 --> 53:05.586
I’m Maggie.

53:05.588 --> 53:07.021
No, don't come around!
Oh, she's coming around.

53:07.023 --> 53:08.355
Hi, there.
Nice to meet you.

53:08.357 --> 53:09.857
Oh, let's just hug it out.
Am I wrong?

53:09.859 --> 53:12.026
Here's the thing.

53:12.028 --> 53:14.261
Lloyd is too shy to tell you,

53:14.263 --> 53:16.997
but he has been nominated
as Prom King.

53:16.999 --> 53:19.166
And I think he's gonna win.

53:20.636 --> 53:22.436
I-it's all set then, Lloyd.
I’ll see you at prom.

53:22.438 --> 53:23.437
- All right.
- Okay.

53:23.439 --> 53:24.805
- Lloyd's mom?
- Yes.

53:24.807 --> 53:26.307
- It was nice to meet you.
- You too.

53:26.309 --> 53:28.943
You should be very proud
of your son.

53:28.945 --> 53:31.946
Thank you.

53:33.149 --> 53:35.316
- You did it!
- Shh! Shh!

53:35.318 --> 53:37.051
- We're good!
- This is a library.

53:37.053 --> 53:39.186
Okay, okay, sorry.
Oh, but you were perfect.

53:39.188 --> 53:40.821
You spoke from the heart.

53:40.823 --> 53:42.156
Okay, thank you, thank you.
Now please leave.

53:42.158 --> 53:43.290
It was -- okay.
I’m gonna call your dad,

53:43.292 --> 53:44.525
Even though I hate him.

53:44.527 --> 53:46.026
Okay, fine.
Thank you. Bye!

53:46.028 --> 53:47.895
- Bye, I love you. Bye!
- Bye.

53:47.897 --> 53:49.897
Bye.

53:49.899 --> 53:51.532
I refuse to do
our science homework.

53:51.534 --> 53:53.400
I know.

53:58.673 --> 54:01.041
Whoa, hey!
I saw you with him!

54:01.043 --> 54:03.177
Okay, I-I don't know --
you got the wrong guy.

54:03.179 --> 54:04.578
Don't lie to me, you whore!

54:04.580 --> 54:06.046
What?

54:06.048 --> 54:07.581
I was his first, you skanky bitch!
Whose first?

54:07.583 --> 54:10.417
- Parker's!
- Oh, Parker?

54:10.419 --> 54:12.853
You are nothing compared
to my love for Parker!

54:12.855 --> 54:14.655
That self-important
narcissist?

54:14.657 --> 54:16.056
Wait, what's going on?

54:16.058 --> 54:17.391
Oh, my God,
I’m so sorry!

54:17.393 --> 54:18.893
- Break it up!
- He's trying to take my man!

54:18.895 --> 54:20.661
He doesn't go to this school!
Hey!

54:20.663 --> 54:21.896
You're not even a real cop!
Come on with me.

54:21.898 --> 54:24.231
Leave him alone!
Stop it!

54:24.233 --> 54:26.066
Leave me alone!
Ooh, you're strong.

54:26.068 --> 54:27.401
Oh, you're --
are you all right?

54:27.403 --> 54:29.069
Y-yeah, are you?

54:29.071 --> 54:31.872
Yeah, I’m f-- I’m fine.
Let's -- let's go. come on.

54:31.874 --> 54:33.507
How do you even know
that guy?

54:33.509 --> 54:35.109
I  <i>don't</i>  know him.
Really?

54:35.111 --> 54:36.610
Never met him before.
No!

54:36.612 --> 54:37.611
Not a scorned lover?

54:37.613 --> 54:38.746
No, no.

54:38.748 --> 54:39.847
Well, I don't --

54:39.849 --> 54:41.081
Oh.
What?

54:41.083 --> 54:42.283
You've got a little --
it's like --

54:42.285 --> 54:43.517
Where? Is it

54:43.519 --> 54:45.519
all right, there you go.
You're good.

54:45.521 --> 54:48.055
It's a little ticklish.
Yeah.

54:48.057 --> 54:51.725
Uh, oh, here, ready?
Just -- you got a little --

54:51.727 --> 54:53.961
just, um...
What? just...

54:53.963 --> 54:55.462
just...yeah.

54:55.464 --> 54:57.698
How's that?

54:57.700 --> 54:59.066
That -- that's --

54:59.068 --> 55:01.035
Yeah?
Yeah.

55:01.037 --> 55:03.204
I’ve got, like,
rocker-hair goin' on right now, right?

55:03.206 --> 55:05.372
Lloyd Cooper, whoo!
Yeah, that's you.

55:05.374 --> 55:06.974
No. not me.

55:06.976 --> 55:09.143
So, you ready for prom?

55:09.145 --> 55:10.811
No, not in the least.

55:10.813 --> 55:12.613
Me neither.

55:12.615 --> 55:15.482
You're, uh,
goin' with Josh? right?

55:15.484 --> 55:17.785
Why does everyone
assume that?

55:17.787 --> 55:19.720
I mean, just because
I’m a cheerleader

55:19.722 --> 55:21.388
and he's the quarterback,

55:21.390 --> 55:23.490
and, I don't know, we've slept
together 200,000 times

55:23.492 --> 55:25.259
doesn't make it
a foregone conclusion.

55:25.261 --> 55:26.894
Right. Ah. My bad.

55:28.264 --> 55:30.097
Nah, I’m goin' stag this year.

55:30.099 --> 55:31.799
Yeah?

55:31.801 --> 55:34.134
Yeah. The guys at this school
are so dumb.

55:34.136 --> 55:35.936
And as an added bonus,
it'll piss off my mom.

55:35.938 --> 55:37.304
Mm.

55:37.306 --> 55:39.406
Yeah,
I-I’m going by myself, too.

55:39.408 --> 55:41.175
What? Why?

55:41.177 --> 55:44.178
Boys are lining up
to go with you.

55:45.748 --> 55:47.815
I’ll see you later.

55:47.817 --> 55:49.750
Uh, Carrie?

55:49.752 --> 55:53.621
Uh, you, uh...
you wouldn't at all

55:53.623 --> 55:56.690
be interested in
maybe going to prom with me?

55:56.692 --> 55:59.627
Uh, really?

55:59.629 --> 56:03.264
Yeah! Uh, why not?

56:03.266 --> 56:04.999
I thought you liked boys.

56:05.001 --> 56:07.835
Uh, I’m asking you

56:07.837 --> 56:11.005
because I...
want to go with you.

56:11.007 --> 56:14.808
I en-enjoy, um,
spending time with you.

56:14.810 --> 56:18.712
I -- I -- you make me laugh,
easily and often.

56:18.714 --> 56:21.015
When you talk in class,

56:21.017 --> 56:23.017
I actually enjoy
hearing what you have to say,

56:23.019 --> 56:25.519
as opposed to normally when
I just wanna gouge my eyes out.

56:29.191 --> 56:33.560
well...
that just made my day.

56:33.562 --> 56:36.063
And?

56:36.065 --> 56:38.666
Let's do this, it'll be fun.

56:38.668 --> 56:40.534
- Really?
- Really.

56:40.536 --> 56:42.102
Yes.

56:50.245 --> 56:51.745
Dude.

56:51.747 --> 56:53.047
What was that?

56:53.049 --> 56:56.050
Nothin', it was fine.

56:56.052 --> 56:57.885
She just kissed you
on the cheek?!

56:57.887 --> 56:59.153
- Yeah!
- What?!

56:59.155 --> 57:00.521
Yeah!

57:00.523 --> 57:02.656
Yeah, dude!

57:02.658 --> 57:06.093
Okay. Wa-hoo-hoo!

57:06.095 --> 57:08.362
Someone's got a date!

57:08.364 --> 57:10.464
Someone's got a date!

57:14.269 --> 57:16.770
What, do you take all nine
of these mustards

57:16.772 --> 57:18.605
and put them together and eat it?

57:18.607 --> 57:20.741
There's nothing in here!
- There's yogurt.

57:22.445 --> 57:24.545
Mmm!

57:24.547 --> 57:27.247
You're not actually gonna drink
that concoction, are you?

57:27.249 --> 57:29.683
Yeah, I am.
And so are you.

57:29.685 --> 57:30.918
Because you are gonna get
into better shape,

57:30.920 --> 57:32.353
aging rock star.

57:32.355 --> 57:33.620
- What is wrong with me, right?
- Nothing.

57:33.622 --> 57:35.923
Hello, parental units!

57:35.925 --> 57:37.691
- Hey!
- Hey.

57:37.693 --> 57:40.894
Tons of yogurt in there?
Try it.

57:40.896 --> 57:43.430
Well, he looks happy
for a change.

57:43.432 --> 57:46.900
Yeah, maybe it's 'cause he has
a date to the prom.

57:46.902 --> 57:48.736
I would know
if he had a date to the prom.

57:48.738 --> 57:50.771
Maybe you wouldn't.

57:50.773 --> 57:53.874
What?

57:53.876 --> 57:55.943
He has a date to the prom?

57:55.945 --> 57:57.544
He got a date for the prom.
How do you know that?

57:57.546 --> 58:00.114
I guess he told me.

58:00.116 --> 58:01.782
Have you met the guy?

58:01.784 --> 58:04.051
What's his name?
How old is he? Who is he?

58:04.053 --> 58:07.988
Carrie. Aged 17, 18?

58:07.990 --> 58:10.557
Carrie. I’ve never met a boy
"Carrie,"

58:10.559 --> 58:13.394
but it's like Cary Grant.
Is he dashing?

58:13.396 --> 58:14.962
Carrie is not a boy.

58:14.964 --> 58:16.930
What?

58:16.932 --> 58:18.732
Carrie is a girl.

58:18.734 --> 58:20.667
I don't get it.

58:20.669 --> 58:24.438
I don't really know how I could
make that any clearer.

58:24.440 --> 58:26.573
Oh.

58:26.575 --> 58:28.809
Great.

58:28.811 --> 58:29.910
So typical of you.

58:29.912 --> 58:31.779
Oh!

58:31.781 --> 58:33.814
Great, that was good.

58:37.019 --> 58:39.753
You planned this.
I know you did.

58:39.755 --> 58:41.989
You confused him
into asking a girl out.

58:41.991 --> 58:44.091
I did not!
It's what you do.

58:44.093 --> 58:49.530
It is amazing how a great moment
for our son occurs,

58:49.532 --> 58:52.466
and somehow you think it's some
kind of attack on you!

58:52.468 --> 58:53.834
Maybe you're having trouble
accepting this,

58:53.836 --> 58:57.337
but listen to me now --
our son is gay.

58:58.841 --> 59:00.774
And shoving him face first
out of the closet

59:00.776 --> 59:02.042
is what you think is best?

59:02.044 --> 59:03.644
That's not what I’m doing.

59:03.646 --> 59:06.547
And I really don't care
what you think is best for him.

59:06.549 --> 59:08.515
I’m sorry.
I just don't, okay?

59:08.517 --> 59:10.617
'Cause I’ve been here,
<i>here,</i>  for 17 years,

59:10.619 --> 59:12.019
day in and day out.

59:12.021 --> 59:13.954
The amount of time
that you've spent with him

59:13.956 --> 59:16.523
adds up to, I don't know,
a celebrity marriage?

59:16.525 --> 59:19.026
So, you know what?
You just don't get to say.

59:19.028 --> 59:21.495
I’m here! I’m here now!

59:21.497 --> 59:24.364
I’m doing my best, and, you know,
if you keep this up,

59:24.366 --> 59:26.166
Lloyd is going to hate you.

59:26.168 --> 59:29.636
And I wouldn't blame him
one iota.

59:29.638 --> 59:32.172
Yeah, good. I get it now.

59:32.174 --> 59:34.575
You get to be best buds
with him -- fine!

59:34.577 --> 59:36.810
Take him out, get him drunk,
pick up girls,

59:36.812 --> 59:39.246
I don't care, but when the time
comes to pay for shit,

59:39.248 --> 59:41.081
don't come to me
because I’ll be here

59:41.083 --> 59:44.084
trying to figure out a way to pay for
college on the East Coast.

59:44.086 --> 59:45.819
You could never, ever, ever do it,

59:45.821 --> 59:47.721
And I know you can't
because you've never been there for me

59:47.723 --> 59:50.324
because you're
just a deadbeat dad!

59:58.333 --> 01:00:00.300
Sorry, Lloyd.

01:00:09.244 --> 01:00:12.179
Well, what are you doin'
out here?

01:00:17.952 --> 01:00:20.354
Hey,
so, a prom date, huh?

01:00:20.356 --> 01:00:22.556
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

01:00:22.558 --> 01:00:24.791
Is she pretty?

01:00:24.793 --> 01:00:26.326
Uh, yeah.

01:00:35.436 --> 01:00:36.637
Fix that tablecloth!

01:00:36.639 --> 01:00:38.372
Where are those chairs going?

01:00:50.051 --> 01:00:52.452
Less smiling, more working!

01:00:52.454 --> 01:00:56.223
Barbara Wolfe demands this prom
be perfect!

01:01:22.083 --> 01:01:23.750
Hey, Dad.

01:01:26.322 --> 01:01:28.155
You like it?

01:01:28.157 --> 01:01:30.090
You look like a man.

01:01:30.092 --> 01:01:31.658
Thank you.

01:01:31.660 --> 01:01:34.027
Okay, I got it. I got it.
Okay. Here I am.

01:01:34.029 --> 01:01:35.329
So handsome.

01:01:35.331 --> 01:01:38.265
What are you doin' here?

01:01:38.267 --> 01:01:42.536
I thought
I might cook you dinner.

01:01:42.538 --> 01:01:43.637
A little peace offering.

01:01:43.639 --> 01:01:45.005
Mom? Dad?

01:01:45.007 --> 01:01:48.342
Is there, uh, somethin'
you wanna tell me?

01:01:48.344 --> 01:01:51.511
No, I have not forgiven him yet.
Wait, I’m coming down.

01:01:53.182 --> 01:01:54.481
Okay, I want a full shot, full shot!
Okay, all right.

01:01:54.483 --> 01:01:56.450
Okay. Look at me.

01:01:56.452 --> 01:01:58.986
You're so handsome.
- Thank you.

01:01:58.988 --> 01:02:01.822
Oh, my God.  Look at you.

01:02:02.992 --> 01:02:05.025
- Oh, okay. Ready?
- Mm.

01:02:05.027 --> 01:02:06.226
Three...

01:02:06.228 --> 01:02:07.294
two... one.

01:02:07.296 --> 01:02:08.462
There you go.

01:02:08.464 --> 01:02:09.830
Have fun, be safe.

01:02:09.832 --> 01:02:11.131
- Okay, yeah, you too.
- Unh-unh, mm.

01:02:11.133 --> 01:02:12.499
See you, Dad.

01:02:12.501 --> 01:02:13.567
Bye.

01:02:13.569 --> 01:02:16.703
Good night.

01:02:20.742 --> 01:02:23.910
This better be an epic dinner.

01:02:23.912 --> 01:02:26.747
Barbecue.

01:02:49.038 --> 01:02:51.104
Maggie?

01:02:56.177 --> 01:02:58.111
Well, I have no idea
what to expect, but...

01:03:04.452 --> 01:03:08.221
<i>you guys look great.</i>

01:03:08.223 --> 01:03:09.856
<i>Well, thank you. I appreciate it.</i>

01:03:09.858 --> 01:03:12.592
<i>Hey.</i>

01:03:17.199 --> 01:03:19.566
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:03:19.568 --> 01:03:20.967
You look so cute!

01:03:20.969 --> 01:03:22.202
I love your dress.
- It's so glamorous.

01:03:22.204 --> 01:03:24.771
Thank you.
Have fun tonight.

01:03:33.981 --> 01:03:36.283
Freeze!
What are you doin', punk?

01:03:36.285 --> 01:03:39.152
Give me that. Give it to me.

01:03:44.459 --> 01:03:46.259
Hi, guys. how are you?

01:03:50.599 --> 01:03:54.267
Don't you think you're just
a little  <i>old</i>  for the prom?

01:03:54.269 --> 01:03:55.502
Hi.

01:03:55.504 --> 01:03:56.670
Hmm.

01:03:58.339 --> 01:03:59.840
Look at them.

01:04:01.976 --> 01:04:05.078
Come on, let him be.
Let's go.

01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:07.347
Why isn't she dancing?
She seems uptight.

01:04:07.349 --> 01:04:09.116
She's just not right
for him.

01:04:09.118 --> 01:04:11.084
Let 'em have their fun.
Maybe we can have some fun.

01:04:11.086 --> 01:04:12.486
She probably doesn't even
like to dance.

01:04:12.488 --> 01:04:13.987
She just seems like that type
who's like,

01:04:13.989 --> 01:04:15.589
"Ew, I don't
wanna get my dress dirty."

01:04:15.591 --> 01:04:17.424
You've gotta quit bashing Carrie.

01:04:17.426 --> 01:04:20.327
Listen to me, I have somebody
better for Lloyd -- better!

01:04:20.329 --> 01:04:21.862
And he's gonna be here
any minute now,

01:04:21.864 --> 01:04:24.297
and it's just gonna be perfect,
and it has to happen

01:04:24.299 --> 01:04:26.032
because the scholarship rep
is here!

01:04:26.034 --> 01:04:27.601
You gotta be kidding me!

01:04:27.603 --> 01:04:29.770
He arranged this date.
<i>he</i>  did!

01:04:29.772 --> 01:04:31.671
Let him be!

01:04:31.673 --> 01:04:34.341
This could all blow up right now
because of her!

01:04:34.343 --> 01:04:36.143
It is time
to leave him alone.

01:04:36.145 --> 01:04:38.211
So let's go. Now!

01:04:38.213 --> 01:04:39.613
Excuse me.

01:04:39.615 --> 01:04:40.981
You okay?

01:04:40.983 --> 01:04:44.151
Yeah, I’ll be right back.

01:04:44.153 --> 01:04:45.519
Okay.

01:04:45.521 --> 01:04:46.720
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:04:46.722 --> 01:04:47.988
Good.

01:04:47.990 --> 01:04:51.458
What -- no, no, no!

01:04:59.367 --> 01:05:01.868
Okay. Okay.

01:05:21.056 --> 01:05:23.089
Beautiful dress.

01:05:23.091 --> 01:05:25.325
Oh, thank you.
Cool jacket.

01:05:25.327 --> 01:05:26.893
Vintage?
Yeah, yeah.

01:05:26.895 --> 01:05:28.728
I rock the vintage.

01:05:29.765 --> 01:05:31.364
I’m Lloyd's mom.

01:05:31.366 --> 01:05:33.333
Oh! I-it's so nice to
finally meet you!

01:05:33.335 --> 01:05:35.502
I’m -- I’m Carrie.
Oh, I know who you are.

01:05:35.504 --> 01:05:38.538
You're the girl tryin' to steal
my son away from me.

01:05:38.540 --> 01:05:40.106
I’m kidding.

01:05:40.108 --> 01:05:41.875
Oh, my God.

01:05:41.877 --> 01:05:42.943
You should see your face.

01:05:42.945 --> 01:05:44.511
You were like, "What?"

01:05:44.513 --> 01:05:45.712
Yeah.
Pale.

01:05:45.714 --> 01:05:47.447
That was --
that was funny.

01:05:47.449 --> 01:05:49.049
You're Barbara Wolfe's
daughter, right?

01:05:49.051 --> 01:05:51.351
Yeah.

01:05:51.353 --> 01:05:53.053
"I’m Barbara Wolfe."

01:05:53.055 --> 01:05:54.354
She knows everybody.

01:05:54.356 --> 01:05:56.890
Did you know Lloyd
used to dress up

01:05:56.892 --> 01:05:59.392
in my clothes
when he was a kid?

01:05:59.394 --> 01:06:02.462
No,
I-I did not know that.

01:06:02.464 --> 01:06:05.265
Here's the weird thing --
his favorite dress of mine

01:06:05.267 --> 01:06:07.634
was exactly like the dress
you're wearing.

01:06:07.636 --> 01:06:10.437
You don't say.
I-I-I didn't know that.

01:06:10.439 --> 01:06:13.106
Isn't that a coinkidink?

01:06:13.108 --> 01:06:14.407
Um... kinda crazy.

01:06:14.409 --> 01:06:15.542
A huge coinkidink.

01:06:15.544 --> 01:06:16.776
Yeah.

01:06:16.778 --> 01:06:18.612
He used to put on these shows

01:06:18.614 --> 01:06:20.814
and dance and sing around the house.

01:06:20.816 --> 01:06:22.816
It was adorable.
- Well, I’m sure.

01:06:22.818 --> 01:06:24.584
I would've loved to have seen it.

01:06:24.586 --> 01:06:26.219
It sounds hilarious.

01:06:26.221 --> 01:06:28.221
But lately he's not putting on
shows around the house.

01:06:28.223 --> 01:06:31.758
It's just sort of different
at my place.

01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:33.393
Uh...

01:06:33.395 --> 01:06:35.929
It's really as if you came along,

01:06:35.931 --> 01:06:38.064
and now he's confused.

01:06:38.066 --> 01:06:42.068
Uh, I’m sorry, Mrs. Cooper,

01:06:42.070 --> 01:06:44.404
I-I don't think I understand.

01:06:44.406 --> 01:06:48.108
It's like his whole life,
Lloyd was a vegetarian,

01:06:48.110 --> 01:06:50.677
and now suddenly he likes the beef.

01:06:50.679 --> 01:06:53.680
Well, can't he like vegetables
<i>and</i>  beef?

01:06:53.682 --> 01:06:55.348
Okay.

01:06:55.350 --> 01:06:58.451
We both want what's best
for Lloyd, right?

01:06:58.453 --> 01:07:00.153
Well, of course.
Mrs. Cooper,

01:07:00.155 --> 01:07:02.322
I think your son
is a wonderful person.

01:07:02.324 --> 01:07:03.423
I-I like him a lot.

01:07:03.425 --> 01:07:05.792
Okay. so let's do this.

01:07:05.794 --> 01:07:07.627
Let's have a girls' secret.

01:07:07.629 --> 01:07:09.362
A secret?

01:07:09.364 --> 01:07:11.031
- Here's what's gonna happen.
- Mm-hmm?

01:07:11.033 --> 01:07:13.300
You know how some people
go to prom together?

01:07:13.302 --> 01:07:15.268
Uh-huh.

01:07:15.270 --> 01:07:19.873
Sometimes people take
a cab home.

01:07:19.875 --> 01:07:21.541
Okay?

01:07:29.551 --> 01:07:32.352
And you gotta be careful
in New York, like, I don't know.

01:07:32.354 --> 01:07:33.954
You're --
you're pretty cute,

01:07:33.956 --> 01:07:35.422
and New York's pretty hard.

01:07:35.424 --> 01:07:36.923
They're gonna -- they're gonna
eat you up out there, man.

01:07:36.925 --> 01:07:38.091
Come on.

01:07:38.093 --> 01:07:39.159
Yeah, you gotta start
working out or somethin'.

01:07:39.161 --> 01:07:40.593
- I’ll be fine.
- Hey.

01:07:40.595 --> 01:07:43.096
Do you mind if I talk to Lloyd
for just a second?

01:07:43.098 --> 01:07:44.030
Just a second.

01:07:44.032 --> 01:07:45.966
- Sorry.
- What's up?

01:07:45.968 --> 01:07:47.500
Um, your mom
was in the bathroom,

01:07:47.502 --> 01:07:49.135
and she tried to pay me
to get me to leave.

01:07:49.137 --> 01:07:51.571
Are you kidding?
Where is she?

01:07:51.573 --> 01:07:53.740
Okay, first of all,
what are you doing here?

01:07:53.742 --> 01:07:55.475
There are a lot of parents here.

01:07:55.477 --> 01:07:57.577
There are parents here
chaperoning, sure.

01:07:57.579 --> 01:07:59.312
There is nobody else here

01:07:59.314 --> 01:08:01.247
who is sabotaging their kid's
life like you are mine.

01:08:01.249 --> 01:08:02.849
That is not true!

01:08:02.851 --> 01:08:04.084
So you  <i>didn't</i>  just try to pay
Carrie to leave?

01:08:04.086 --> 01:08:06.219
- I-I’m sorry --
- It's okay.

01:08:06.221 --> 01:08:08.188
Apologize to her right now,
and go home.

01:08:08.190 --> 01:08:09.556
Don't talk to me like that.

01:08:09.558 --> 01:08:10.824
I have had it with you!

01:08:10.826 --> 01:08:11.891
I am trying to help you!

01:08:11.893 --> 01:08:13.226
You are  <i>not</i>  helping me!

01:08:13.228 --> 01:08:14.828
I am --
what are you talking about?

01:08:14.830 --> 01:08:16.395
You can't do this on your own.
I have to be here.

01:08:16.398 --> 01:08:17.831
No, I can do this on my own.
I’m fine!

01:08:17.832 --> 01:08:19.666
Dan, Dan! Hey!
Dan. Who is Dan?

01:08:19.667 --> 01:08:22.402
This is my son, Lloyd.

01:08:22.404 --> 01:08:24.237
I’ve heard so much about you.
Nice to meet you.

01:08:24.238 --> 01:08:25.505
Dan loves to read,
he's a Pisces,

01:08:25.506 --> 01:08:26.640
and he loves  <i>Sailor Moon.</i>

01:08:26.642 --> 01:08:28.075
Wasn't that
your favorite show?

01:08:28.077 --> 01:08:29.609
I love  <i>Sailor Moon.</i>
who's your favorite sailor?

01:08:29.611 --> 01:08:31.243
Sailor Mercury.  Dan, I’m sorry.

01:08:31.246 --> 01:08:33.078
Uh, you've been tricked
into coming down here.

01:08:33.081 --> 01:08:34.680
My mom is insane. You need to leave.

01:08:34.683 --> 01:08:37.216
No! my son is trying to teach me
a lesson about meddling,

01:08:37.219 --> 01:08:38.752
- But you should stay.
- Because this is all about you, right?

01:08:38.754 --> 01:08:40.420
- No --
- Do you like Italian food, Dan?

01:08:40.421 --> 01:08:42.756
Yeah,
I love Italian fo--
Come here.

01:08:44.358 --> 01:08:46.559
Wow.

01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:47.627
How was that?

01:08:49.196 --> 01:08:52.599
Good. Come here.

01:09:11.219 --> 01:09:12.986
Uh

01:09:12.988 --> 01:09:16.823
Now, please go home.
You should not be here.

01:09:16.825 --> 01:09:18.058
I --

01:09:18.060 --> 01:09:19.459
No.
Come on, Carrie, let's go.

01:09:19.461 --> 01:09:22.562
Derek, listen.

01:09:22.564 --> 01:09:24.430
I am so sorry.

01:09:24.433 --> 01:09:26.265
I have been lying to you
this whole time.

01:09:26.368 --> 01:09:28.835
My mom submitted me for the
scholarship without my knowledge.

01:09:28.837 --> 01:09:30.270
I do not deserve it.

01:09:30.272 --> 01:09:31.504
You should give it
to somebody who does.

01:09:31.506 --> 01:09:32.772
I’m really sorry.
Wait.

01:09:32.774 --> 01:09:34.240
What?

01:09:34.242 --> 01:09:37.743
Are you telling me...
you're not gay?

01:09:37.746 --> 01:09:39.779
I don't know.
I really don't know.

01:09:39.781 --> 01:09:41.613
Honestly, I--

01:09:41.616 --> 01:09:44.084
Why is everybody so intent
on putting a label on me?

01:09:44.086 --> 01:09:46.519
I have no idea if I’m gay
or straight.

01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:48.287
I’d never even kissed anybody

01:09:48.290 --> 01:09:50.356
until about 30 seconds ago, okay?

01:09:50.358 --> 01:09:52.125
I don't know.
Is that all right?

01:09:52.127 --> 01:09:53.259
Good night.
Come on.

01:10:08.442 --> 01:10:10.310
- Lloyd!
- Yes?

01:10:10.312 --> 01:10:12.112
You can just
kiss New York goodbye,

01:10:12.114 --> 01:10:13.346
because I can't pay
for it.

01:10:13.348 --> 01:10:15.048
I cannot pay for it.

01:10:15.050 --> 01:10:17.784
And you just made it completely
clear you don't want my help.

01:10:17.786 --> 01:10:20.687
I don't want your help.
No, I really don't.

01:10:20.689 --> 01:10:22.455
If I wanna go to NYU,

01:10:22.457 --> 01:10:23.823
I will save up the money
on my own

01:10:23.825 --> 01:10:25.225
and I will get myself there.

01:10:25.227 --> 01:10:27.293
It's not even about NYU.
I don't care about NYU.

01:10:27.295 --> 01:10:30.396
I just wanted to get as far away
from you as I could.

01:10:35.936 --> 01:10:38.171
Well, now you all know me.

01:10:38.173 --> 01:10:42.976
I’m Principal Mackie,
and, uh, well, I’d just like to

01:10:42.978 --> 01:10:45.578
welcome all you
Woodbridge students,

01:10:45.580 --> 01:10:46.813
uh, to our prom.

01:10:46.815 --> 01:10:48.648
and now,

01:10:48.650 --> 01:10:53.586
Barbara Wolfe will
announce the winners of Prom Court!

01:11:00.694 --> 01:11:03.229
I know
that there is something

01:11:03.231 --> 01:11:05.165
that we have all been
waiting for --

01:11:05.167 --> 01:11:08.935
who our prom king and queen
are tonight!

01:11:08.937 --> 01:11:11.871
Here we go.

01:11:11.873 --> 01:11:14.774
Oh, my gosh!

01:11:14.776 --> 01:11:19.245
My own baby, Carrie Wolfe,
is prom queen!

01:11:19.247 --> 01:11:21.548
Oh, I’m so proud of her!

01:11:21.550 --> 01:11:23.716
Carrie Wolfe and...

01:11:23.718 --> 01:11:27.687
prom king is Lloyd Cooper?

01:11:27.689 --> 01:11:31.624
Yeah-ha-ha-hah!
Whoo!

01:11:31.626 --> 01:11:33.793
Carrie?

01:11:33.795 --> 01:11:36.129
<i>They left.</i>

01:11:36.131 --> 01:11:41.434
Son of a mother shh-ackin' son
my mother f-fist in the --

01:11:42.904 --> 01:11:44.571
Oh, it's fine.

01:11:44.573 --> 01:11:46.773
Our winners.

01:11:46.775 --> 01:11:48.608
Oh, it's all...

01:11:51.046 --> 01:11:53.313
Yes. oh, yes.

01:11:53.315 --> 01:11:55.148
Barbara Wolfe says,

01:11:55.150 --> 01:11:59.652
"Enjoy your starry,
starry magical night."

01:11:59.654 --> 01:12:02.555
Dance, shoo, go everyone,
dance!

01:12:23.511 --> 01:12:25.645
<i>What, I’m your mother!</i>

01:12:25.647 --> 01:12:26.846
<i>I know where you are
at all times!</i>

01:12:26.848 --> 01:12:28.248
<i>Let me tie your shoes.</i>

01:12:28.250 --> 01:12:29.682
<i>What do you think about
when you...</i>

01:12:29.684 --> 01:12:31.184
<i>Are you seeing anyone?</i>

01:12:31.186 --> 01:12:32.485
<i>Let me do up that shirt for you.</i>

01:12:32.487 --> 01:12:34.087
<i>When was your first kiss?</i>

01:12:34.089 --> 01:12:35.622
<i>I love you.
I’m never gonna leave you.</i>

01:12:35.624 --> 01:12:36.990
<i>Do you...dust?</i>

01:12:36.992 --> 01:12:40.260
<i>Lloyd, are you gay?</i>

01:13:50.497 --> 01:13:51.764
You ready?

01:13:51.766 --> 01:13:53.666
So ready.

01:13:53.668 --> 01:13:55.835
All right.

01:13:59.841 --> 01:14:02.408
Hey!
What's she doin' here?

01:14:02.410 --> 01:14:04.510
Wow.

01:14:08.849 --> 01:14:12.919
You thought I was just gonna let
you go without saying goodbye?

01:14:12.921 --> 01:14:15.054
Come here.

01:14:15.056 --> 01:14:18.291
Oh, I’m gonna miss you.

01:14:18.293 --> 01:14:19.625
I’m gonna miss you, too.

01:14:19.627 --> 01:14:22.261
Hey, listen, thank you.

01:14:22.263 --> 01:14:23.463
For what?

01:14:23.465 --> 01:14:26.032
For being my friend, really.

01:14:26.034 --> 01:14:28.101
I wish it happened sooner, but...

01:14:28.103 --> 01:14:30.470
- Better late than never, right?
- Yeah.

01:14:31.772 --> 01:14:33.439
I, um --
I got you something.

01:14:33.441 --> 01:14:34.807
Oh!

01:14:34.809 --> 01:14:38.478
Yes.
Little going-away present.

01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:40.880
I’ve, um --
I’ve been saving up.

01:14:40.882 --> 01:14:42.949
N-New York City is, like,
super super expensive.

01:14:42.951 --> 01:14:44.984
Oh, my gosh.
Are you kidding me?

01:14:48.790 --> 01:14:50.723
- I can't -- I can't take this.
- Yes! Yes!

01:14:50.725 --> 01:14:54.961
It's yours. And the next time
I find myself in New York City,

01:14:54.963 --> 01:14:56.996
you can pay me back by letting
me crash at your place,

01:14:56.998 --> 01:14:58.431
for life.

01:14:58.433 --> 01:14:59.799
You know I got the scholarship, right?

01:14:59.801 --> 01:15:03.236
W-what? wait, how?
How did this happen?

01:15:03.238 --> 01:15:05.738
Well, apparently, bisexual
or questioning still qualifies.

01:15:07.308 --> 01:15:09.976
Derek was super-impressed
that he was honest,

01:15:09.978 --> 01:15:11.677
so that clinched the deal.

01:15:11.679 --> 01:15:14.013
Doing the right thing paid off,
who knew?

01:15:14.015 --> 01:15:15.648
Lloyd.

01:15:15.650 --> 01:15:17.183
Oh, my God!
I’m so happy for you.

01:15:17.185 --> 01:15:18.651
Here, here, here, here,
please. come on.

01:15:18.653 --> 01:15:20.953
No, no, you know what?
Take it, you know?

01:15:20.955 --> 01:15:22.688
I-I still want a place
to stay,

01:15:22.690 --> 01:15:24.857
and the scholarship
won't cover everything, so...

01:15:24.859 --> 01:15:26.793
You are just the best.
You're just the best.

01:15:26.795 --> 01:15:28.761
- Come here. Mm.
- Ah.

01:15:28.763 --> 01:15:30.029
All right, get out of here
before I take you with me.

01:15:30.031 --> 01:15:31.764
Mm, I wish you would.

01:15:35.502 --> 01:15:37.837
You all right?

01:15:37.839 --> 01:15:39.038
- Yeah.
- Are you crying?

01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:40.706
Maybe.

01:15:40.708 --> 01:15:43.776
What's wrong with a dad bein'
sad his kid's goin' away?

01:15:43.778 --> 01:15:45.812
- Come here.
- You're goin'.

01:15:45.814 --> 01:15:47.513
You're gonna fly.
I love you.

01:15:47.515 --> 01:15:49.048
I love you, too, Dad.

01:15:49.050 --> 01:15:51.784
You are gonna kick ass
in that town.

01:15:53.555 --> 01:15:55.154
You are just -- you are not
gonna believe it.

01:15:55.156 --> 01:15:57.156
It's such a cool place.
- Can't wait.

01:15:57.158 --> 01:15:59.625
- You are gonna have the most fun.
- I will.

01:15:59.627 --> 01:16:00.860
Wait!

01:16:00.862 --> 01:16:02.862
I’m right here, Mom!

01:16:07.868 --> 01:16:10.336
A couple things.

01:16:10.338 --> 01:16:13.039
- I gotta go 
or I’m gonna miss my flight, okay?
- I know, I know. here.

01:16:13.041 --> 01:16:14.307
Okay.

01:16:14.309 --> 01:16:15.475
- Did you pack your I.D.?
- Yeah.

01:16:15.477 --> 01:16:16.909
- Warm clothes?
- Yes.

01:16:16.911 --> 01:16:18.177
- It's winter there, you know.
- Yeah.

01:16:18.179 --> 01:16:19.178
Okay. I’m good.

01:16:19.180 --> 01:16:21.514
I’m gonna miss you.

01:16:21.516 --> 01:16:23.683
I’m gonna miss you, too.

01:16:23.685 --> 01:16:26.085
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:16:26.087 --> 01:16:28.354
Even all your
wildly inappropriate stories.

01:16:28.356 --> 01:16:31.224
Come here.

01:16:32.926 --> 01:16:34.227
I love you, Mom.

01:16:34.229 --> 01:16:35.928
I love you, too.

01:16:35.930 --> 01:16:37.663
I love you.

01:16:37.665 --> 01:16:40.032
- Okay, we're gonna let go, okay?
- Okay.

01:16:40.034 --> 01:16:42.435
On three, two, one.
Let's do three, two, one, ready?

01:16:42.437 --> 01:16:43.836
Three, two, one.
- Okay.

01:16:43.838 --> 01:16:45.271
Good. good. oh.
Oh, I wasn't ready.

01:16:45.273 --> 01:16:46.873
Okay, that's okay.
Ready?

01:16:46.875 --> 01:16:49.108
Three, two, one.

01:16:50.611 --> 01:16:53.012
See? There you go.

01:16:53.014 --> 01:16:54.413
I love you, Mom.

01:16:54.415 --> 01:16:56.849
Okay.

01:16:58.119 --> 01:17:00.186
- Hey.
- Huh?

01:17:00.188 --> 01:17:02.255
You don't hate me, huh?

01:17:02.257 --> 01:17:04.190
No.

01:17:04.192 --> 01:17:06.192
Okay.
He doesn't hate me.

01:17:06.194 --> 01:17:08.194
Good.

01:17:08.196 --> 01:17:09.629
Keep an eye on her, all right, Carrie?

01:17:09.631 --> 01:17:11.631
Absolutely.

01:17:11.633 --> 01:17:12.899
Bye, Lloyd.

01:17:12.901 --> 01:17:14.867
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:17:34.221 --> 01:17:36.155
Okay.

01:18:31.111 --> 01:18:32.211
Surprise!

01:18:32.213 --> 01:18:33.512
Hey!

01:18:33.514 --> 01:18:35.181
- Hi!
- Hi.

01:18:35.183 --> 01:18:37.116
Happy birthday.

01:18:37.118 --> 01:18:39.685
My birthday's not for another
six months. you know that.

01:18:39.687 --> 01:18:41.621
Yeah,
but the security guard

01:18:41.623 --> 01:18:43.856
I had to bribe downstairs
does not.

01:18:43.858 --> 01:18:45.791
Uh-huh.

01:18:45.793 --> 01:18:47.159
Hi.

01:18:47.161 --> 01:18:49.829
What are you doing
in New York City?

01:18:49.831 --> 01:18:52.565
Well, I had these frequent flyer
miles I had to use,

01:18:52.567 --> 01:18:54.066
so I just thought,
"I’ll come see my son!"

01:18:54.068 --> 01:18:55.701
You don't have
frequent flyer miles, though.

01:18:55.703 --> 01:18:57.903
No, I don't.
No.

01:18:57.905 --> 01:18:59.138
But your dad does.

01:18:59.140 --> 01:19:02.208
And, uh,
he's downstairs.

01:19:02.210 --> 01:19:04.043
- Right now?
- Yeah.

01:19:04.045 --> 01:19:06.579
'Cause, um,
we're here together.

01:19:06.581 --> 01:19:09.215
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:19:09.217 --> 01:19:10.816
Mom, that's so good to hear.

01:19:10.818 --> 01:19:11.884
It's okay, huh?

01:19:11.886 --> 01:19:14.420
That's great, yeah!
Okay.

01:19:14.422 --> 01:19:16.589
Um, so, do you wanna have dinner?

01:19:16.591 --> 01:19:18.224
No, yeah, that'd be great.
Really?

01:19:18.226 --> 01:19:19.425
Yeah, yeah, of course!

01:19:19.427 --> 01:19:20.860
Okay. we made a reservation and --

01:19:20.862 --> 01:19:22.361
Perfect!
Yeah, of course.

01:19:22.363 --> 01:19:25.498
Okay.
It's really great in here.

01:19:25.500 --> 01:19:29.335
Reservations for how many?

01:19:31.371 --> 01:19:33.739
Mom?
