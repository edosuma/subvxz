00:51.200 --> 00:53.668
Hey! Come on.
Let's move!

00:53.760 --> 00:54.795
No!

00:54.880 --> 00:56.438
- Let me see.
- No!

00:56.600 --> 00:58.238
Come on. I made you
a special breakfast.

00:58.400 --> 00:59.549
You can't cook.

00:59.720 --> 01:02.234
Hey, Mary, open up!

01:07.520 --> 01:08.919
You look beautiful.

01:10.200 --> 01:11.792
I look like a Disney character.

01:20.400 --> 01:21.992
Where's the "special"?

01:22.160 --> 01:23.160
The what?

01:23.280 --> 01:25.840
You said you made me
a special breakfast.

01:31.200 --> 01:32.952
Please don't make me go.

01:33.200 --> 01:35.270
You can keep homeschooling me.

01:35.600 --> 01:36.856
I've taught you
everything I know.

01:36.880 --> 01:38.074
But I don't wanna go.

01:38.280 --> 01:40.396
Well, I don't wanna go
to work, but I do.

01:41.400 --> 01:44.437
You don't go to work.
You fix the boats on a dock.

01:45.240 --> 01:47.549
Okay. It's a poor example,
but you're still going.

01:50.080 --> 01:51.308
But what about Fred?

01:51.400 --> 01:52.435
What about him?

01:52.520 --> 01:53.656
You won't
take care of him.

01:53.680 --> 01:54.749
You don't like cats.

01:54.920 --> 01:55.976
I don't like two-eyed cats.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.240
Fred, as you know,
is monocular.

01:57.280 --> 01:58.880
Who's gonna throw him
his ping pong ball?

01:59.040 --> 02:00.800
Fred's gonna be fine.
No more argument, okay?

02:00.960 --> 02:02.393
We've discussed this
ad nauseam.

02:05.760 --> 02:06.909
What's ad nauseam?

02:07.080 --> 02:08.308
Oh, you don't know?

02:08.440 --> 02:09.919
Well, looks like
someone needs school.

02:18.680 --> 02:20.033
This is gonna be fun.

02:20.240 --> 02:21.360
You're gonna meet kids today

02:21.400 --> 02:23.595
you can borrow money from
the rest of your life.

02:26.040 --> 02:27.109
Come on.

02:31.440 --> 02:32.759
You're gonna be great.

02:34.400 --> 02:35.594
You know, just...

02:37.400 --> 02:38.958
I don't know. Try bein' a kid.

02:57.040 --> 02:58.075
Mmm-mmm.

03:01.920 --> 03:02.955
Frank!

03:05.440 --> 03:06.873
Frank, I know you hear me.

03:10.720 --> 03:11.914
Frank!

03:29.240 --> 03:31.959
There's still time
for you to undo this nonsense.

03:32.120 --> 03:34.509
Go get in your car
and go get that child.

03:35.760 --> 03:36.960
Are you technically allowed to

03:37.040 --> 03:38.473
use those keys
whenever you want?

03:38.640 --> 03:40.232
How can you stand there...

03:40.320 --> 03:41.656
acting all calm
and everything, Frank,

03:41.680 --> 03:42.749
and make light of this?

03:43.680 --> 03:45.591
Now go get her back
before it's too late.

03:46.800 --> 03:47.856
She gotta get out
in the world.

03:47.880 --> 03:48.960
She has no friends her age.

03:49.080 --> 03:50.433
No social skills.

03:51.200 --> 03:53.475
She doesn't know
how to be a kid.

03:54.720 --> 03:56.039
Two nights ago,
she told me

03:56.120 --> 03:57.536
that even if Germany
bails out the euro...

03:57.560 --> 03:59.869
there could still be
a worldwide depression.

04:00.920 --> 04:02.680
I was staring at the ceiling
for three hours.

04:05.320 --> 04:06.389
I'm so worried.

04:08.120 --> 04:10.270
Come on, Roberta.

04:10.440 --> 04:11.555
If you start crying,

04:11.640 --> 04:13.280
I'm gonna have to
pretend to start crying.

04:14.480 --> 04:15.754
Hey.

04:16.200 --> 04:18.350
You know, there's something
you could be overlookin'.

04:19.200 --> 04:20.315
This could work out.

04:21.959 --> 04:22.995
Maybe.

04:23.920 --> 04:25.990
But if anybody takes
that baby away...

04:26.200 --> 04:28.430
I'll smother you
in your sleep.

04:28.880 --> 04:30.393
Morning, Fred.

04:36.600 --> 04:38.716
One plus one is two.

04:38.920 --> 04:40.831
That is fact number one
of today.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.356
Who can tell me
what two plus two is?

04:44.520 --> 04:45.714
Who's got it?

04:46.640 --> 04:47.914
- Mmm-hmm?
- Four.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
Excellent, Donna.

04:49.080 --> 04:51.992
It is. Two plus two is,
indeed, four.

04:52.840 --> 04:55.434
Okay, who wants to try
three plus three?

04:57.240 --> 05:00.038
Three plus three? Really?

05:01.800 --> 05:02.869
I beg your pardon?

05:03.680 --> 05:05.511
What kinda school
is this anyway?

05:05.680 --> 05:07.318
It's the kind of school

05:07.400 --> 05:09.595
where students don't speak
without permission.

05:09.760 --> 05:12.513
All right.
But everyone knows it's six.

05:13.240 --> 05:16.118
Nobody in this classroom
speaks...

05:16.280 --> 05:18.669
unless they are called upon.

05:18.880 --> 05:20.950
Okay? Is everybody clear
on that?

05:21.120 --> 05:22.917
Yes, ma'am.

05:23.080 --> 05:25.594
Good. Mary, can you
stand up please?

05:26.680 --> 05:28.511
Stand on up. Stand up, babe.

05:28.960 --> 05:31.554
These questions are for you
because you're so advanced.

05:34.280 --> 05:35.952
What is nine plus eight?

05:36.120 --> 05:37.439
17.

05:37.800 --> 05:40.678
Yeah. Yes, it is.
That's good.

05:41.720 --> 05:42.948
What is...

05:43.120 --> 05:44.348
15 plus 17?

05:44.520 --> 05:45.953
32.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.673
Yeah. That is right.

05:51.400 --> 05:52.400
All right, then.

05:52.560 --> 05:56.439
Well, what is 57 plus 135?

05:57.080 --> 05:59.275
192.

06:03.240 --> 06:04.389
Yeah.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.309
Can you tell me...

06:13.480 --> 06:19.112
what 57 multiplied by 135 is?

06:31.600 --> 06:32.635
Okay.

06:33.880 --> 06:36.917
Who can tell me what four...

06:37.120 --> 06:41.193
7,695.

06:41.920 --> 06:43.592
I don't think
anyone can do that.

06:46.520 --> 06:48.750
The square root is 87.7.

06:50.600 --> 06:51.794
And change.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.797
Now what does ad nauseam mean?

06:57.880 --> 06:59.598
I have a very strange kid.

06:59.760 --> 07:01.239
I have 27 strange kids.

07:01.440 --> 07:02.475
Good morning.

07:02.640 --> 07:03.936
Good morning, good morning,
good morning.

07:03.960 --> 07:05.976
That's great, guys,
but take your seats, okay?

07:06.000 --> 07:08.230
Oh, God. See ya.

07:09.280 --> 07:10.400
Good morning, Ms. Stevenson.

07:10.560 --> 07:11.675
Good morning.

07:11.840 --> 07:13.558
Mind if I sit in?

07:13.720 --> 07:14.720
Not at all!

07:14.800 --> 07:16.358
Okay, class.

07:16.520 --> 07:17.520
I have a treat for you.

07:17.600 --> 07:22.958
I would like to introduce you
to our principal, Mrs. Davis.

07:23.120 --> 07:24.951
Good morning, first graders.

07:25.120 --> 07:28.237
Good morning, Mrs. Davis.

07:28.400 --> 07:30.994
Are you ready
for a great year?

07:31.160 --> 07:32.673
Yes!

07:34.160 --> 07:35.513
Uh... Yes, Mary?

07:35.720 --> 07:36.869
She's the boss?

07:37.760 --> 07:40.320
Mrs. Davis is our principal.
Mm-kay...

07:40.520 --> 07:41.794
Okay. Now I want you

07:41.880 --> 07:43.296
to get on your phone
and call Frank...

07:43.320 --> 07:45.231
and tell him to
get me out of here!

07:49.880 --> 07:52.394
Wait a minute.
That's the dad? I know him.

07:52.560 --> 07:54.630
I see him at Ferg's
almost every Friday night.

07:55.040 --> 07:57.110
He's the quiet,
damaged hot guy.

07:58.560 --> 08:00.994
What are you doing at Ferg's
every Friday night?

08:01.160 --> 08:03.116
Trying to get picked up
by him.

08:09.120 --> 08:10.872
Excuse me? Hi.

08:11.360 --> 08:13.430
Oh. Look, it's my teacher.

08:13.600 --> 08:16.319
Probably wants to remind me
what one plus one is.

08:16.400 --> 08:17.435
Go to the car, okay?

08:18.640 --> 08:19.834
- Hi.
- Hi.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.536
Sorry to yell at you
and then chase you down.

08:21.560 --> 08:22.629
It's okay. Mary's teacher?

08:22.800 --> 08:23.994
Yes. I'm Bonnie Stevenson.

08:24.160 --> 08:25.640
Frank. How are you?
Sorry about today.

08:25.760 --> 08:27.160
I know she got
a little overexcited.

08:27.240 --> 08:28.456
I think
it's just first day jitters.

08:28.480 --> 08:29.515
Sure. Yeah.

08:29.600 --> 08:31.256
We're running a little late
actually. We gotta get going.

08:31.280 --> 08:33.554
Okay. I don't even wanna
talk about that.

08:33.720 --> 08:35.312
- I'll keep you just a minute.
- Okay.

08:37.280 --> 08:38.315
I think your daughter...

08:38.480 --> 08:40.789
I think Mary might be gifted.

08:41.840 --> 08:42.989
What?

08:43.159 --> 08:47.153
Yeah. Today in Math,
she answered some really...

08:47.320 --> 08:49.072
- Oh, no, no, no. That's...
- No, please.

08:49.240 --> 08:50.416
- It's not gifted.
- Really difficult questions.

08:50.440 --> 08:51.475
All right.

08:51.560 --> 08:52.856
Just that
a seven-year-old would...

08:52.880 --> 08:54.074
It's Trachtenberg.

08:55.080 --> 08:57.116
- Jakow Trachtenberg.
- I'm sorry?

08:57.280 --> 08:59.475
Spent seven years
in a Nazi concentration camp.

08:59.680 --> 09:02.513
Developed a system
to rapidly solve problems.

09:03.360 --> 09:04.793
It's the Trachtenberg method.

09:06.040 --> 09:07.314
But she's...

09:07.720 --> 09:09.870
I mean, she's seven though.

09:10.040 --> 09:11.439
I learned it when I was eight.

09:12.040 --> 09:13.393
Do I look gifted to you?

09:15.120 --> 09:16.348
It's kind of gone out of vogue

09:16.440 --> 09:18.635
since the invention
of the calculator...

09:19.000 --> 09:21.195
but, uh, I can still win
a drink at a bar using it.

09:21.760 --> 09:22.829
Sorry for today.

09:23.240 --> 09:25.151
- Won't happen again.
- Okay.

09:25.240 --> 09:27.356
Nice to meet you. Bonnie.

09:27.440 --> 09:28.509
Frank.

09:49.920 --> 09:51.194
Hmm.

09:51.840 --> 09:53.096
For the record,
I didn't wanna go

09:53.120 --> 09:54.712
to the stupid school
in the first place.

09:54.880 --> 09:56.279
And the boy in the next row

09:56.360 --> 09:59.033
acts inappropriately
for someone who's a child.

09:59.320 --> 10:02.312
I'm sorry. I'm still passive
aggressively ignoring you.

10:03.120 --> 10:05.680
Other kids answer questions.
They don't get into trouble.

10:05.920 --> 10:07.990
You didn't get in trouble
for answering questions.

10:08.160 --> 10:09.513
You yelled at the principal.

10:10.600 --> 10:12.830
You know what? You're gonna
find this interesting.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.281
So, I googled "first graders
who yell at the principal..."

10:15.320 --> 10:16.736
and statistically,
you're never gonna

10:16.760 --> 10:18.113
believe how many kids do it.

10:18.240 --> 10:19.275
How many?

10:19.560 --> 10:20.629
None.

10:24.400 --> 10:27.073
Frank, I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.

10:27.240 --> 10:28.468
Yeah, right.

10:29.160 --> 10:31.276
You can't show off
like that at school.

10:31.480 --> 10:32.629
I know.

10:32.800 --> 10:34.680
You promised you wouldn't,
then the first day...

10:34.800 --> 10:36.756
I know, I know. I screwed up.

10:41.560 --> 10:44.313
Do you think maybe
this boat needs a test ride?

10:47.360 --> 10:48.395
Go get Fred.

10:49.680 --> 10:51.079
Don't run.

11:02.080 --> 11:06.631
I listen to the wind
To the wind of my soul

11:10.440 --> 11:12.192
Where I'll end up
Well, I think

11:12.280 --> 11:15.829
Only God really knows

11:19.120 --> 11:21.953
I've sat upon the setting sun

11:23.240 --> 11:27.119
But never, never, never, never

11:27.960 --> 11:31.157
I never wanted water once

11:31.960 --> 11:35.077
No, never, never, never

11:35.240 --> 11:37.800
Fred loves to watch
the sandpipers.

11:38.920 --> 11:40.717
He thinks he'd like to
catch one...

11:40.880 --> 11:42.472
but he'd regret it.

11:43.400 --> 11:45.311
Fred's not a killer.

11:45.480 --> 11:46.959
He's a lover.

11:53.720 --> 11:56.632
Would my mom have wanted me
to go to this school?

11:57.040 --> 11:58.473
I can only guess.

11:59.920 --> 12:00.920
But I'll tell you what,

12:01.000 --> 12:02.718
she would have wanted you
to have friends.

12:03.040 --> 12:04.712
Idiot friends?

12:06.360 --> 12:08.828
And she'd want you to have
compassion for others.

12:10.160 --> 12:12.879
Like a cat can have
for a sandpiper.

12:15.960 --> 12:17.951
But what if
they don't like me?

12:20.080 --> 12:21.274
Then they're idiots.

12:33.040 --> 12:34.268
Good morning, class.

12:34.480 --> 12:38.155
Good morning, Ms. Stevenson.

12:39.040 --> 12:40.155
Good morning, Mary.

12:42.600 --> 12:46.149
Good morning, Ms. Stevenson.

12:46.960 --> 12:48.029
Okay, good morning.

12:52.560 --> 12:53.959
Get a hold of yourself.

12:56.160 --> 12:58.435
For my Show and Tell,
I have...

12:58.600 --> 13:00.909
the most awesome cat
in the history of time.

13:01.480 --> 13:04.517
Not only
is his name Fred, but...

13:08.360 --> 13:11.193
He has just one eye.

13:11.440 --> 13:13.396
Uno. Go ahead and count...

13:13.600 --> 13:16.751
but I promise you,
it's always one.

13:16.920 --> 13:18.433
How did he lose his eye?

13:19.560 --> 13:21.835
I don't know. I wasn't there.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.433
Just found him
inside of a trash can

13:23.520 --> 13:26.512
next to a bottle of alcohol
or something.

13:26.680 --> 13:29.877
He is a smart, smart cat,
but no one realizes that.

13:30.680 --> 13:33.672
No one understands him.
No one.

13:34.000 --> 13:37.595
Put your name
on the top of the paper...

13:37.760 --> 13:40.718
so that I know
who did such good work.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.120
I left my pen with you.

13:42.200 --> 13:43.599
Pass those around, guys.

13:43.800 --> 13:45.279
Okay? I wanna see your work.

13:45.440 --> 13:47.476
Turn around, face the desk.

13:48.240 --> 13:50.276
Think about
how you get to the answer.

13:50.440 --> 13:54.274
It's not just about,
you know, guessing.

13:54.440 --> 13:55.839
Don't be messy.

13:56.760 --> 13:57.795
Done.

14:08.320 --> 14:09.514
Let's see.

14:11.840 --> 14:13.159
Mmm-hmm.

14:13.240 --> 14:16.118
Okay. I thought
you might finish quickly,

14:16.200 --> 14:17.679
so a little something extra.

15:07.440 --> 15:08.509
Done.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.194
Oh...

16:45.200 --> 16:46.315
Do you know who I am?

16:46.520 --> 16:49.956
Hey! Mary's teacher...

16:51.160 --> 16:52.229
Bonnie.

16:52.400 --> 16:53.992
You lied to me.

16:54.960 --> 16:56.075
Okay.

16:56.280 --> 16:58.111
- Can you narrow it down?
- Mmm-hmm.

16:58.280 --> 17:01.511
I'd like to know the truth
about Mary, my student...

17:01.680 --> 17:03.671
your niece.

17:07.119 --> 17:08.314
I was running

17:08.400 --> 17:09.674
ridiculously late for a date...

17:09.880 --> 17:11.915
and my sister showed up
with Mary.

17:12.079 --> 17:13.752
And she never just
showed up unannounced.

17:13.839 --> 17:15.353
She never showed up
with the baby.

17:15.960 --> 17:19.191
She said she wanted to talk.

17:20.440 --> 17:21.998
She said she needed to talk.

17:22.640 --> 17:24.915
I told her I would talk to her
when I got back.

17:25.079 --> 17:27.119
I think I figured showing up
that late to my date...

17:27.240 --> 17:29.037
would hurt my chances
of gettin' laid.

17:31.400 --> 17:33.675
Came home that night
and Mary was on the couch...

17:33.840 --> 17:36.513
and found Diane
on the bathroom floor.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.956
I mean, there's no way
I coulda known...

17:42.000 --> 17:43.592
but I shoulda known.

17:45.200 --> 17:46.474
Six and a half years later,

17:46.560 --> 17:48.073
me and Mary
are still hangin' out.

17:48.720 --> 17:50.676
And what about the father?

17:52.600 --> 17:54.272
Diane was
so socially awkward...

17:54.440 --> 17:57.159
she didn't date enough to know
a good guy from a bad guy.

17:57.320 --> 17:59.788
This particular guy
didn't last a month.

17:59.960 --> 18:01.632
And no grandparents?

18:02.920 --> 18:07.755
- Dad died when I was eight.
- My mom...

18:08.080 --> 18:09.957
Short version is
she turned her back on Diane

18:10.040 --> 18:11.234
when she got pregnant.

18:13.120 --> 18:14.120
Why?

18:16.520 --> 18:18.192
Didn't fit into her plan.

18:19.480 --> 18:22.119
She's an exacting woman,
my mother.

18:22.280 --> 18:24.077
Uncompromising.

18:26.080 --> 18:27.195
Very British.

18:27.360 --> 18:30.113
Do you mean,
British in demeanor or...

18:30.280 --> 18:32.350
- No. Like she's...
- She's from England.

18:32.520 --> 18:34.192
From England. Yeah.

18:39.440 --> 18:42.432
So, Mary is a genius?

19:15.120 --> 19:16.439
Oh!

19:17.680 --> 19:19.113
Look out. Look out.

19:19.280 --> 19:22.033
Your little animals
are escaping, dumbass.

19:22.200 --> 19:25.112
Hey! You should not
be laughing!

19:25.960 --> 19:28.349
You did a mean thing
to a little kid!

19:28.560 --> 19:30.073
What are you gonna do
about it?

19:50.440 --> 19:53.159
Hey. Hey, you okay?

19:53.880 --> 19:56.713
You good? All right.

19:58.240 --> 19:59.798
How do we resolve this?

19:59.880 --> 20:01.472
You know,
she could be expelled.

20:02.080 --> 20:04.355
God. I hope not.

20:04.520 --> 20:06.715
But if every other first-time
offender was expelled,

20:06.800 --> 20:07.869
I guess fair is fair.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.712
Are you gonna
take this seriously?

20:09.880 --> 20:13.475
Sure. You don't bluff me,
I don't bluff you.

20:15.920 --> 20:17.638
Ms. Stevenson believes

20:17.720 --> 20:19.676
that your child
is exceptional...

20:19.840 --> 20:22.434
and has talents
that our curriculum

20:22.520 --> 20:24.033
can't begin to challenge.

20:24.240 --> 20:25.992
It just so happens

20:26.120 --> 20:28.236
that I am good friends
with the headmaster

20:28.400 --> 20:31.119
of the Oaks Academy
for Gifted Education.

20:31.280 --> 20:32.508
He has always said

20:32.600 --> 20:34.556
that if I find
that one in a million...

20:34.720 --> 20:37.712
And the one in a million
has a $30,000 tuition.

20:38.400 --> 20:40.516
Mr. Adler, I can get
your daughter a scholarship.

20:40.680 --> 20:41.749
Full ride.

20:42.080 --> 20:43.911
I wouldn't say it
if I couldn't do it.

20:56.560 --> 20:59.711
I realize, putting that girl
in that setting,

20:59.880 --> 21:02.917
you know, 99 times out of
a 100, that's what you do.

21:03.080 --> 21:04.440
It's the Oaks.
It's a great school.

21:04.520 --> 21:05.669
I looked into it.

21:06.560 --> 21:08.835
But this family has a history
with those schools.

21:10.440 --> 21:12.715
And I think the last thing
that little girl needs

21:12.880 --> 21:15.314
is reinforcement
that she's different.

21:16.280 --> 21:18.271
Trust me, she knows. So...

21:20.560 --> 21:24.235
I think Mary,
I think she's gotta be here.

21:25.760 --> 21:27.671
Today's a bad ending.
You can't hit people.

21:28.200 --> 21:29.952
But a 12-year-old
bullies a seven-year-old

21:30.040 --> 21:31.359
and she stands up?

21:32.000 --> 21:34.136
Do you know how important
it is to me that she did that?

21:34.160 --> 21:36.355
You know how proud I am
of her? Aren't you?

21:36.560 --> 21:38.835
Mr. Adler, your daughter
shattered a young boy's...

21:39.000 --> 21:41.195
I know. You can't hit people.

21:41.400 --> 21:43.311
That will be made very clear.
I get that.

21:43.480 --> 21:46.119
But Mrs. Davis,
if we separate our leaders,

21:46.320 --> 21:49.756
if we segregate them
from people like you and me,

21:49.920 --> 21:51.911
you get congressmen.

21:53.520 --> 21:54.520
So, I'm sorry.

21:54.600 --> 21:56.477
I wish I could take
your offer, but Mary stays.

21:56.640 --> 21:57.709
Unless you kick her out.

21:57.920 --> 22:00.718
This is a mistake. We'll never
be able to raise this child

22:00.920 --> 22:03.514
to the level of scholarship
she deserves.

22:04.920 --> 22:08.799
Well, just dumb her down
into a decent human being.

22:09.320 --> 22:10.389
Everybody wins.

22:15.560 --> 22:18.597
You know what?
Can you excuse me one minute?

22:19.560 --> 22:21.278
Bring me
every piece of paperwork

22:21.400 --> 22:22.753
we have on this girl.

22:24.960 --> 22:25.960
Hey.

22:29.320 --> 22:31.515
Are you sure
you know what you're doing?

22:35.520 --> 22:36.520
No.

22:42.760 --> 22:43.909
Okay. Mary, I think

22:44.000 --> 22:45.656
you have something you'd like
to say to the class.

22:45.680 --> 22:47.910
You wanna hop up and say it?

22:53.640 --> 22:56.632
Okay. I'm supposed to
say something.

22:57.080 --> 23:01.153
Hitting people is wrong
even if they're bad.

23:01.320 --> 23:05.199
I won't do it again,
so don't be afraid of me.

23:07.640 --> 23:09.756
Okay. Thank you.

23:09.920 --> 23:12.354
Now can I say something
I wanna say?

23:13.120 --> 23:14.120
Sure.

23:15.520 --> 23:17.158
Before they ruined it,

23:17.320 --> 23:19.880
Justin's zoo
was the best art project.

23:21.360 --> 23:24.079
By far. It was awesome.

23:26.600 --> 23:29.831
Come on. A little harder.

23:32.000 --> 23:33.035
Okay.

23:34.480 --> 23:37.358
Thank you. Thank you.

23:43.720 --> 23:46.109
There's a lady standing
in front of our door.

23:46.320 --> 23:47.355
Who is it?

23:47.520 --> 23:49.715
How should I know? I'm seven.

23:53.680 --> 23:55.830
That would be
your grandmother.

23:56.560 --> 23:59.313
Holy shit!

24:01.880 --> 24:04.189
An Apple? Whoa.

24:05.600 --> 24:07.431
It's a MacBook, darling.

24:07.600 --> 24:09.989
Top of the line
with the Retina Display.

24:10.160 --> 24:12.993
Hey, you know who else
has a Retina Display?

24:13.080 --> 24:14.115
Fred!

24:14.800 --> 24:18.156
Mary, I understand
you like mathematics.

24:18.320 --> 24:20.117
So, on there,

24:20.280 --> 24:21.349
you'll find a great

24:21.480 --> 24:23.914
out-of-print book
by Charles Zimmer

24:24.200 --> 24:26.668
called Transitions
in Advanced Algebra.

24:27.280 --> 24:29.430
Yeah. Love that book.

24:31.240 --> 24:32.514
You're saying you've read it?

24:32.680 --> 24:35.797
Yeah. I've kind of moved on
to differential equations now.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.116
Don't forget your manners.
Thank your grandma.

24:39.280 --> 24:40.508
Thank you, Grandma.

24:40.680 --> 24:43.399
Grandmother or Evelyn
will do just fine.

24:44.680 --> 24:47.353
There's so much more on there.

24:47.520 --> 24:49.280
Things I know you'll find
really challenging.

24:49.440 --> 24:51.032
Yes. But sadly,
it's a school night

24:51.120 --> 24:52.439
and there's homework to do.

24:52.600 --> 24:54.955
What a surprise though, right?

24:55.120 --> 24:56.951
Say good night
to Grandmother or Evelyn.

24:57.760 --> 24:59.113
Good night.

24:59.680 --> 25:01.716
I'd kill a priest
for a Benadryl.

25:01.880 --> 25:03.199
Still with the allergies?

25:03.360 --> 25:05.191
Why in God's name
have you got a cat?

25:05.280 --> 25:06.429
You don't even like cats.

25:06.600 --> 25:08.192
It's not my cat.
It's Mary's cat.

25:08.280 --> 25:09.679
I'm just along for the ride.

25:09.760 --> 25:10.829
So let me guess.

25:10.920 --> 25:12.558
Our lovely principal,
Ms. Davis.

25:12.720 --> 25:14.950
Never get on the bad side
of small-minded people

25:15.120 --> 25:16.473
who have a little authority.

25:16.640 --> 25:18.278
I thought I taught you that.

25:19.880 --> 25:21.029
What are you doin' here?

25:21.120 --> 25:22.256
You don't think
I have the right

25:22.280 --> 25:23.315
to see my granddaughter?

25:23.400 --> 25:25.755
I do. I'm thrilled your
seven-year exhaustive search

25:25.960 --> 25:28.315
has finally come
to a fruitful conclusion.

25:29.160 --> 25:32.118
I don't think this is
an appropriate time to talk.

25:32.280 --> 25:33.395
Certainly not the setting.

25:33.560 --> 25:35.551
While I was waiting,
a cockroach this big

25:35.640 --> 25:37.437
tried to steal my shoe.

25:37.640 --> 25:39.596
Yeah. They'll take a shoe.

25:41.320 --> 25:43.629
Honestly, this?

25:43.800 --> 25:47.634
This godforsaken mosquito
ranch was a conscious choice?

25:49.360 --> 25:51.749
I could drop you back off
at the airport.

26:13.520 --> 26:16.830
This thing is loaded
with cool problems.

26:25.720 --> 26:27.551
So, are you teaching?

26:27.720 --> 26:28.948
I repair boats.

26:29.280 --> 26:31.669
- Please.
- I'm not bad at it either.

26:31.840 --> 26:33.592
Well, then,
that explains this.

26:33.760 --> 26:35.876
They don't sell
sunscreen here?

26:36.040 --> 26:37.075
I wear sunscreen.

26:37.280 --> 26:39.475
Not enough.
And you need a hat.

26:39.640 --> 26:42.393
A big hat that shades
your face and neck.

26:42.560 --> 26:44.336
You're playing Russian
roulette with your skin.

26:44.360 --> 26:45.679
You look like a porn producer.

26:45.840 --> 26:48.354
Okay. I appreciate the advice.
I do.

26:48.520 --> 26:50.416
But we're not here to talk
about sunscreen, are we?

26:50.440 --> 26:53.193
Oh, so no more small talk?
That's a shame.

26:53.720 --> 26:56.917
Okay. The environment you have
created for that child

26:57.080 --> 26:58.798
where she lives,
the school she attends,

26:58.880 --> 27:00.200
it's substandard,
every bit of it.

27:00.280 --> 27:01.633
I disagree.

27:01.720 --> 27:02.755
We're getting nowhere

27:02.840 --> 27:03.976
if we're not gonna be honest
with each other.

27:04.000 --> 27:05.752
I am being honest.

27:05.920 --> 27:09.310
I see. Fine. Well, I'm not
leaving without her.

27:09.520 --> 27:12.114
Well, welcome to Florida.

27:12.280 --> 27:14.430
Frank, please listen
to reason.

27:14.600 --> 27:16.909
At some point, either you're
gonna come to the conclusion,

27:17.000 --> 27:18.069
or someone in authority

27:18.160 --> 27:19.296
is going to spell it out
for you

27:19.320 --> 27:21.595
that the child's best interest
is all that matters.

27:21.760 --> 27:24.115
You're gonna make me
pull rank, I will.

27:24.280 --> 27:25.679
Diane didn't want you
to have her.

27:26.440 --> 27:27.555
Diane...

27:29.360 --> 27:31.157
Diane didn't always
think things through.

27:31.320 --> 27:33.256
Arguably one of the brightest
minds on the planet.

27:33.280 --> 27:34.480
Good luck
going down that road.

27:34.600 --> 27:35.800
And what do you think
she'd say

27:35.840 --> 27:37.956
if she saw
how her child is living now?

27:38.120 --> 27:40.031
Do you honestly think
she'd be pleased?

27:40.200 --> 27:42.714
That she's living a somewhat
normal life? Yes. I do.

27:42.880 --> 27:44.836
She's not normal.
And treating her as such...

27:45.000 --> 27:46.718
is negligence
on a grand scale.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.389
I know your heart's
in the right place on this.

27:49.960 --> 27:53.111
But you are denying the girl
her potential. You are.

27:54.040 --> 27:56.235
I can provide for her,
I can enrich her life.

27:56.360 --> 27:58.280
Oh, come on, Evelyn.
You're gonna take that girl,

27:58.360 --> 27:59.496
you're gonna bury her
in tutors...

27:59.520 --> 28:01.376
then you're gonna loan her
out to some think tank...

28:01.400 --> 28:02.958
where she can talk
non-trivial zeros...

28:03.160 --> 28:05.136
with a bunch of old Russian
guys for the rest of her life.

28:05.160 --> 28:06.957
And you'd bury her
under a rock.

28:07.160 --> 28:08.640
Look, I don't expect you
to understand

28:08.720 --> 28:10.280
the price you have to pay
for greatness.

28:10.360 --> 28:13.352
Oh, I do. That's why I have
Mary in the first place.

28:13.840 --> 28:15.239
That's uncalled for.

28:15.400 --> 28:17.630
Your sister had
a laundry list of problems.

28:17.720 --> 28:19.016
She could have solved
Navier-Stokes

28:19.040 --> 28:20.120
and gone down in history...

28:20.160 --> 28:22.120
as one of the greatest
mathematicians of all time.

28:22.160 --> 28:24.355
But she didn't because
she couldn't finish.

28:24.520 --> 28:25.953
She was weak.

28:26.040 --> 28:27.917
Weak like her father
and weak like...

28:32.240 --> 28:33.309
Well...

28:33.640 --> 28:35.631
Now, if it's who I think
it is...

28:36.280 --> 28:38.350
Kinda puts a black cloud
over our luncheon.

28:38.520 --> 28:41.318
You're still stubborn
and vindictive.

28:42.360 --> 28:43.634
Careful, Mother.

28:43.800 --> 28:46.189
There's an apple and tree
analogy lurking.

28:46.880 --> 28:48.632
You guys ready to order?

28:49.160 --> 28:50.832
Here's an idea.

28:51.040 --> 28:52.792
Stop thinking about me
and you...

28:53.000 --> 28:55.275
and start thinking about
what's best for the child.

28:55.760 --> 28:58.991
For any reasonable person,
a clear picture will emerge.

28:59.360 --> 29:02.033
If it doesn't, I suggest
you call your attorney.

29:05.040 --> 29:07.190
He'll have the bucket of beer.

29:36.520 --> 29:38.317
Hey, let's go outside.

29:40.400 --> 29:41.469
No.

29:42.880 --> 29:44.598
Come on. It's nice out.

29:44.920 --> 29:47.195
I don't care.

29:53.640 --> 29:56.279
Hey, no more math today.

30:08.800 --> 30:10.233
Is there a God?

30:10.400 --> 30:11.719
I don't know.

30:11.880 --> 30:13.154
Just tell me.

30:13.320 --> 30:15.072
I would if I could.

30:15.240 --> 30:17.834
But I don't know.
And neither does anybody else.

30:18.040 --> 30:19.598
Roberta knows.

30:19.760 --> 30:22.149
No.
Roberta has faith

30:22.320 --> 30:23.833
and that's a great thing
to have.

30:24.000 --> 30:25.831
But faith's about
what you think, feel.

30:25.920 --> 30:27.239
Not what you know.

30:27.720 --> 30:29.392
What about Jesus?

30:29.560 --> 30:31.755
Love that guy.
Do what he says.

30:31.920 --> 30:33.911
But is he God?

30:35.160 --> 30:36.593
I don't know.

30:36.760 --> 30:38.193
I have an opinion.

30:38.360 --> 30:40.510
But that's my opinion.
I could be wrong.

30:40.680 --> 30:42.398
So why would I screw up yours?

30:43.840 --> 30:45.114
Use your head.

30:45.320 --> 30:47.675
But don't be afraid
to believe in things either.

30:51.600 --> 30:53.716
Huh.
There was a guy on TV

30:53.800 --> 30:55.392
who said there was no God.

30:56.800 --> 30:57.949
The only difference

30:58.040 --> 30:59.640
between the atheists on TV
and Roberta...

30:59.680 --> 31:01.910
is that Roberta loves you.
She's trying to help.

31:03.600 --> 31:05.113
Tell you what though.

31:05.800 --> 31:06.835
One way or another,

31:06.920 --> 31:08.956
we all end up back together
in the end.

31:09.600 --> 31:11.352
That's what
you're asking, right?

31:13.280 --> 31:14.349
Yep.

31:14.760 --> 31:15.829
Okay.

31:16.400 --> 31:18.630
Find something else
to worry about, will you?

31:19.240 --> 31:20.434
All right.

31:24.720 --> 31:27.518
Okay. Adler,
grandmother and uncle.

31:28.760 --> 31:29.875
Really?

31:31.840 --> 31:33.280
You sure you folks
don't wanna go out

31:33.360 --> 31:34.560
in the hallway
and settle this?

31:38.320 --> 31:40.231
No? Well, that's a shame.

31:40.800 --> 31:43.030
Mr. Cullen, you are here
for the uncle.

31:43.120 --> 31:44.348
Yes, sir, Your Honor.

31:44.520 --> 31:45.999
Start charging you room
and board.

31:46.160 --> 31:47.195
Mr. Highsmith,

31:47.280 --> 31:49.160
you're on the wrong side
of the bay, aren't you?

31:49.320 --> 31:51.959
I'm very happy
to be here, Your Honor.

31:52.080 --> 31:53.160
For the record,
Mrs. Dibbons

31:53.240 --> 31:54.576
is representing
the State of Florida

31:54.600 --> 31:55.828
Child Welfare Department.

31:56.000 --> 31:57.069
Proceed.

31:57.240 --> 31:58.958
Your Honor,
my client, Mrs. Adler

31:59.040 --> 32:00.640
is the maternal grandmother
of the child.

32:00.760 --> 32:02.079
Her daughter,
the girl's mother,

32:02.160 --> 32:03.195
was a troubled woman...

32:03.280 --> 32:05.510
who seven years ago,
sadly, took her own life.

32:05.680 --> 32:07.636
It was at this time
that Mr. Adler

32:07.720 --> 32:09.153
preemptively and illegally...

32:09.360 --> 32:10.588
took custody of the girl

32:10.680 --> 32:12.016
and spirited her
across state lines...

32:12.040 --> 32:14.395
for the purpose
of denying my client custody.

32:14.880 --> 32:17.080
Now, there is evidence that
the child currently lives...

32:17.160 --> 32:20.038
in unclean
and unwholesome conditions.

32:20.320 --> 32:22.117
We petition the court
to grant my client

32:22.200 --> 32:23.320
full custody of the child...

32:23.480 --> 32:24.560
so that she may be returned

32:24.640 --> 32:25.959
to the state
of Massachusetts...

32:26.120 --> 32:28.475
and given the care
to which she is entitled.

32:30.560 --> 32:34.030
My client took an infant under
his wing for one reason only.

32:34.200 --> 32:37.112
It was his sister's desire
that he do so.

32:37.280 --> 32:39.350
My client has been
her constant caregiver.

32:39.560 --> 32:41.456
And, Your Honor, as far as
the living conditions...

32:41.480 --> 32:43.994
I've been in this home.
It's fine.

32:44.160 --> 32:46.435
I mean, if we adopt standards
based on...

32:46.600 --> 32:48.536
our northern friend's
aversion to palmetto bugs...

32:48.560 --> 32:51.074
we won't have a child left
south of Tallahassee.

32:55.360 --> 32:57.032
All right. Last chance
before this starts

32:57.160 --> 32:58.798
costing a lot more money.

32:58.960 --> 33:00.473
Your Honor,
my client would need

33:00.560 --> 33:01.788
reasonable access
to the child.

33:02.040 --> 33:03.189
So ordered.

33:03.280 --> 33:04.416
Ms. Dibbons,
you'll go over there

33:04.440 --> 33:05.656
and check out
the living conditions?

33:05.680 --> 33:06.715
On the books, Your Honor.

33:06.920 --> 33:08.512
All right, folks.
Drive carefully.

33:10.880 --> 33:12.233
Her lawyer has a nice suit.

33:13.240 --> 33:16.437
Relax, Frank. More weight's
put on the talent competition.

33:17.200 --> 33:18.599
Go have a cocktail, hmm?

33:20.400 --> 33:23.278
Roberta, would you
like to have Mary tonight?

33:23.880 --> 33:26.110
Why wouldn't I like
to have Mary tonight?

33:27.760 --> 33:29.671
I told you something like this
would happen.

33:30.120 --> 33:31.439
Now look where we are.

33:32.760 --> 33:34.416
And I'm supposed to believe
you know what you're doing.

33:34.440 --> 33:35.920
You couldn't even find
a white lawyer.

33:36.880 --> 33:38.757
Wow. Look, just...

33:39.400 --> 33:41.040
- Don't worry, okay?
- Don't tell me that.

33:41.200 --> 33:42.110
There's nothing you can say

33:42.200 --> 33:43.456
that's gonna make me
feel good...

33:43.480 --> 33:45.436
because I have no say
in any of this, Frank.

33:45.600 --> 33:46.715
I'm not a blood relative,

33:46.800 --> 33:48.438
I'm not a legal guardian.
I'm nothing!

33:48.680 --> 33:50.000
Just the lady
who lives next door,

33:50.080 --> 33:51.176
whose opinion means nothing...

33:51.200 --> 33:52.952
whose feelings mean nothing.

33:53.880 --> 33:56.348
Would I like to have
Mary tonight?

33:56.760 --> 33:59.069
I'd like to have Mary
every night.

34:05.320 --> 34:08.391
Can't stop me now
Hear what I say

34:10.199 --> 34:11.757
My feets gotta move, so...

34:11.920 --> 34:13.558
Get out of my way

34:13.719 --> 34:15.790
I'm gonna have my say

34:15.960 --> 34:18.793
I'm going to every discotheque

34:18.960 --> 34:21.838
I'm gonna dance, dance, dance
Whoo!

34:21.920 --> 34:23.114
Till the break of day

34:23.280 --> 34:26.716
Oh, shame, shame, shame, shame

34:26.840 --> 34:27.875
Oh!

34:28.000 --> 34:29.991
Shame on you

34:30.159 --> 34:31.478
If you can't dance too

34:32.600 --> 34:35.751
And I said shame, shame,
shame, shame

34:35.920 --> 34:38.672
Shame, shame, shame
Shame on you

34:48.280 --> 34:49.349
Hi.

34:51.760 --> 34:52.760
Hi.

34:54.920 --> 34:58.390
Um, I heard Davis bragging
about a custody case

34:58.480 --> 34:59.913
and then I found out whose...

35:01.280 --> 35:02.599
I feel terrible.

35:02.680 --> 35:04.760
But I also wanted you to know
that after we talked...

35:04.800 --> 35:06.552
I didn't say anything
to anyone.

35:06.720 --> 35:08.517
I swear.

35:08.680 --> 35:11.911
And it's, um, important to me
that you know that.

35:12.960 --> 35:14.029
I know.

35:16.880 --> 35:17.880
Okay.

35:18.040 --> 35:20.190
My lawyer told me
to get drunk.

35:22.760 --> 35:24.200
And you're trying to do it
with that?

35:29.760 --> 35:31.352
Okay. My turn.

35:32.880 --> 35:34.871
Who was your first
celebrity crush?

35:35.400 --> 35:38.472
Um, I'll go with...

35:38.640 --> 35:40.596
Mona from Who's the Boss?

35:40.680 --> 35:41.715
Oh, wow!

35:41.800 --> 35:42.896
You know
who I'm talking about?

35:42.920 --> 35:44.416
- The sexy grandmother.
- Yeah!

35:44.440 --> 35:45.840
I always felt like
she had a secret.

35:45.880 --> 35:48.110
Yeah, which is that
she loved sexual intercourse.

35:48.200 --> 35:49.200
That was it.

35:49.280 --> 35:50.416
And she wasn't secret
about it.

35:50.440 --> 35:52.829
That's why I liked her.

35:53.320 --> 35:54.878
You know what?
I liked her, too.

35:55.080 --> 35:56.229
See?

35:57.240 --> 35:59.037
All right. Um...

35:59.600 --> 36:02.068
Least favorite student.
And why.

36:02.480 --> 36:03.879
Oh, no!
I love all my students.

36:04.040 --> 36:07.476
I don't believe you.
At all! Not for a second.

36:07.680 --> 36:08.908
No, they're all great.

36:09.080 --> 36:10.798
They're all so great.

36:12.360 --> 36:14.112
I'm gonna go ahead and drink.

36:14.280 --> 36:15.759
Let's keep this honest.

36:15.920 --> 36:17.194
He? She?

36:17.320 --> 36:19.197
Uh, he is Ronnie Middleton.

36:19.800 --> 36:21.313
Sounds like a dick.

36:22.880 --> 36:25.155
- He's a little child, okay?
- I'm sorry.

36:25.320 --> 36:27.959
The point is that he's evil
in his core.

36:30.360 --> 36:32.078
And there's nothing I can do.

36:32.240 --> 36:33.719
Wow.

36:39.800 --> 36:41.279
What's your greatest fear?

36:42.520 --> 36:43.714
Wow!

36:43.880 --> 36:44.915
That's a change of tone.

36:45.080 --> 36:46.832
Yup, I'm a really
serious person.

36:47.000 --> 36:48.319
Okay.

36:49.280 --> 36:51.953
Look, if it's too much, you
can just drink your drink...

36:52.680 --> 36:54.955
and live with the fact
that you're afraid.

36:55.120 --> 36:56.951
No, I can handle this. Um...

37:01.960 --> 37:03.518
That I'll ruin Mary's life.

37:15.800 --> 37:17.472
You're very, um...

37:18.520 --> 37:21.557
surprising, Mary's teacher.

37:21.920 --> 37:23.114
Very much so.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.594
- Okay. Hold on. I'm sorry.
- What?

37:31.760 --> 37:33.239
Just so that...

37:33.400 --> 37:35.356
I feel like
I need to say this...

37:35.560 --> 37:37.437
just so that
there's no misconception.

37:37.600 --> 37:38.669
Oh, God. No, I didn't...

37:38.840 --> 37:39.875
No, hold on!

37:40.040 --> 37:42.873
That this can't,
isn't happening.

37:43.040 --> 37:45.315
I get it. I know.
I'm with you.

37:45.480 --> 37:47.596
- Yeah? Okay.
- 100%. We're on the same page.

37:47.760 --> 37:48.829
Good!

37:49.600 --> 37:52.797
No, that's great. I'm sorry.
That's embarrassing.

37:52.960 --> 37:54.518
It's okay. I get it.

37:58.480 --> 37:59.515
Oh!

37:59.600 --> 38:01.511
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

38:01.600 --> 38:02.635
Okay. Good.

38:03.880 --> 38:05.438
Can you promise
that there's no way?

38:05.600 --> 38:07.272
Yes. Roberta has Mary

38:07.360 --> 38:08.536
every Saturday till noon,
I promise.

38:08.560 --> 38:10.471
- Yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.

38:13.120 --> 38:16.271
Mmm. Mmm-mmm. Sorry.

38:16.480 --> 38:18.675
I can't do this.

38:20.680 --> 38:23.558
Okay.

38:24.640 --> 38:25.755
Okay.

38:27.120 --> 38:28.394
I understand.

38:29.840 --> 38:30.989
I'll take you home.

38:31.200 --> 38:32.918
Yeah.

38:33.120 --> 38:36.078
Sorry, just... One more time.

38:53.560 --> 38:55.790
I can't find my DVD.

38:55.960 --> 38:57.598
It's right there, baby.

38:57.760 --> 38:59.478
No, it isn't.
You come and find it.

38:59.640 --> 39:00.920
I'm doing lady business.

39:01.080 --> 39:02.456
Now, you were the last person
to watch it.

39:02.480 --> 39:03.515
What did you do with it?

39:07.120 --> 39:08.348
Oh...

39:37.160 --> 39:38.275
Oh! Oh, my God!

39:48.440 --> 39:51.557
Good morning, Miss Stevenson.

39:52.800 --> 39:53.994
Hi.

39:55.800 --> 39:56.835
Look, I am...

39:56.920 --> 39:58.536
Oh, you know what?
I'm actually incapable...

39:58.560 --> 40:00.596
of having
this conversation right now.

40:00.760 --> 40:02.955
Good. 'Cause I have no idea
what I was gonna say.

40:04.560 --> 40:06.357
Great! Perfect!

40:06.520 --> 40:09.557
Sir, if you please.
Take me to jail.

40:18.080 --> 40:19.433
Awkward.

40:20.800 --> 40:21.800
Mary...

40:21.960 --> 40:23.029
Stop! Stop!

40:23.200 --> 40:25.270
Stop with the Legos! Listen.

40:25.480 --> 40:27.118
Do we have a rule
about Saturday morning?

40:27.320 --> 40:28.514
What?

40:29.360 --> 40:30.496
Are you allowed
in this apartment this early

40:30.520 --> 40:31.720
on Saturday morning?
Yes or no?

40:31.840 --> 40:33.432
- No.
- No!

40:34.960 --> 40:36.154
Are you allowed to... Hey!

40:36.320 --> 40:38.550
Stop! Enough with the Legos.

40:38.720 --> 40:40.631
Are you allowed to
use Roberta's keys?

40:40.800 --> 40:41.994
- No.
- No!

40:42.760 --> 40:45.149
Hey! Look at me.

40:45.320 --> 40:47.595
Then why are you here, huh?

40:48.200 --> 40:49.349
Can you answer me that?

40:49.600 --> 40:51.397
You broke every rule!

40:52.480 --> 40:54.596
You just embarrassed me.

40:54.800 --> 40:55.915
We have these rules.

40:56.080 --> 40:58.116
We've gone over them
a hundred times! Ahh!

40:59.240 --> 41:00.673
God!

41:00.840 --> 41:02.398
Damn it!

41:02.600 --> 41:04.670
Can I just get five minutes
of my own life?

41:34.120 --> 41:36.270
Nothing that happened today
was your fault.

41:36.440 --> 41:38.032
I got mad at you...

41:38.200 --> 41:39.997
I was really mad at me.

41:40.920 --> 41:42.672
And the manufacturers
of Legos,

41:42.760 --> 41:44.113
they should all be in prison.

41:48.680 --> 41:50.113
I'm sorry.

41:52.080 --> 41:53.433
Do you forgive me?

41:54.640 --> 41:56.119
Sure. Whatever.

41:56.760 --> 41:59.115
Hey, close the laptop.
Come on.

41:59.720 --> 42:02.359
Please. Doesn't count
if it's not eye to eye.

42:03.520 --> 42:05.033
Come on, please.

42:08.200 --> 42:10.430
Do you really have no life
because of me?

42:12.680 --> 42:14.238
That's not what I said.

42:14.480 --> 42:15.879
Hmm.

42:16.960 --> 42:18.473
Did you mean it?

42:21.160 --> 42:22.195
Last month you said I was

42:22.280 --> 42:23.376
the worst uncle
in the world...

42:23.400 --> 42:24.674
and you wished death upon me

42:24.760 --> 42:26.000
'cause I didn't buy you
a piano.

42:26.520 --> 42:27.999
Did you mean that?

42:29.160 --> 42:30.593
No.

42:30.760 --> 42:32.478
Not entirely.

42:35.240 --> 42:36.275
There you go.

42:36.440 --> 42:38.908
We say things all the time
we don't mean. So...

42:40.680 --> 42:42.193
Let's forget it, okay?

42:44.280 --> 42:45.280
Okay.

42:45.920 --> 42:47.353
Okay.

42:50.960 --> 42:52.029
Frank?

42:52.200 --> 42:53.200
Yeah?

42:53.880 --> 42:54.880
Can I have a piano?

42:55.040 --> 42:56.075
No.

42:58.000 --> 42:59.720
Was that really Mary's teacher
this morning?

43:00.200 --> 43:01.360
You know, I got a book called

43:01.440 --> 43:03.078
Fundamentals of
Decision Making.

43:03.320 --> 43:04.389
You can borrow it.

43:13.240 --> 43:14.559
What is it?

43:15.600 --> 43:17.352
It's nothing.

43:17.520 --> 43:20.034
Looks like Mary gets to go
to Boston for a couple days.

43:23.880 --> 43:25.552
It's just two days.

43:26.440 --> 43:27.440
Relax.

43:37.600 --> 43:39.158
So, what do you think?

43:40.040 --> 43:41.393
Cool.

43:54.200 --> 43:56.350
Wow! You and my mom...

43:56.520 --> 43:57.999
were always together.

43:59.320 --> 44:00.355
Always.

44:21.840 --> 44:23.717
Oh, no, you don't want
to look at that one.

44:24.000 --> 44:25.000
Is that you?

44:28.600 --> 44:29.600
Yes.

44:32.160 --> 44:33.354
How old were you?

44:33.880 --> 44:34.880
29.

44:36.400 --> 44:38.311
Where is this?

44:38.480 --> 44:40.550
That's Cambridge University.

44:40.720 --> 44:42.711
In England.

44:47.560 --> 44:48.754
Who are those people?

44:48.920 --> 44:50.717
My research colleagues.

44:51.560 --> 44:52.709
For what?

44:52.880 --> 44:54.677
Mathematics, of course.

44:55.440 --> 44:57.032
Really?

44:58.920 --> 45:00.512
Cool!

45:03.080 --> 45:04.832
So, then you came to work...

45:05.000 --> 45:06.149
at a college in America?

45:06.720 --> 45:07.755
No.

45:07.920 --> 45:10.639
I married your grandfather...

45:10.800 --> 45:13.155
and I came back
to America with him.

45:14.200 --> 45:16.191
And I had children.

45:16.440 --> 45:17.634
Oh.

45:18.760 --> 45:19.909
So, no more math?

45:22.880 --> 45:23.915
It's late.

45:24.120 --> 45:25.838
You've got a big day tomorrow.

45:26.000 --> 45:28.958
Come on. Up, up, up.

45:29.160 --> 45:30.479
Can I play the piano?

45:30.560 --> 45:31.560
No, you can't.

45:31.640 --> 45:33.296
- Now stop dragging those feet.
- But, it's fun!

45:33.320 --> 45:34.320
Come on!

45:35.080 --> 45:38.550
I have had
a series of nightmares...

45:38.720 --> 45:40.995
where I'm fired...

45:42.120 --> 45:44.554
because of what happened.

45:44.800 --> 45:46.199
You get it?

45:46.800 --> 45:48.279
And then I try
to rationalize...

45:48.440 --> 45:52.115
that everything that happened
was just all alcohol.

45:57.160 --> 45:58.991
I have an addiction
to fixer guys.

46:14.040 --> 46:15.951
Dr. Shankland,
this problem is...

46:16.120 --> 46:19.317
I know. Just copy it exactly
as you see it written.

46:19.640 --> 46:20.675
But it's...

46:20.920 --> 46:23.480
Exactly as written. Thank you.

46:28.840 --> 46:31.434
So, what's this problem
I'm supposed to look at?

46:31.520 --> 46:33.317
I don't know.

46:33.480 --> 46:35.755
Is it like the problems
Mom worked on?

46:35.920 --> 46:38.070
Your mother didn't work
on problems.

46:38.240 --> 46:40.390
She worked on
just one problem.

46:40.560 --> 46:42.312
Just one?

46:42.480 --> 46:44.038
Her entire life?

46:44.200 --> 46:45.918
Most of it.

46:46.080 --> 46:47.274
Look.

46:48.960 --> 46:52.032
These are
the Millennium Problems.

46:52.840 --> 46:56.230
Seven great
and meaningful problems.

46:56.400 --> 46:58.470
Some mathematicians
have worked

46:58.560 --> 47:00.437
their entire lives
to prove them.

47:01.200 --> 47:02.758
Who's the dude with the beard?

47:02.960 --> 47:04.359
That's not a dude.

47:04.520 --> 47:06.750
That's Grigori Perelman.

47:06.920 --> 47:09.434
He proved
the Poincaré conjecture.

47:09.600 --> 47:12.672
The only one
of the seven proved.

47:12.840 --> 47:14.432
This...

47:16.320 --> 47:18.515
This is your mother's problem.

47:19.760 --> 47:20.829
Na... vi...

47:21.000 --> 47:23.719
Navier-Stokes.

47:25.440 --> 47:27.237
No picture.

47:27.400 --> 47:29.231
- She didn't solve it?
- No.

47:30.320 --> 47:31.719
She was close.

47:33.120 --> 47:34.997
She would have won
the Fields Medal...

47:35.680 --> 47:37.557
and probably shared a Nobel...

47:37.720 --> 47:40.075
considering what it would have
meant for physics.

47:40.240 --> 47:43.118
Maybe I'll have my picture
up here someday.

47:49.240 --> 47:50.992
If you really desire it...

47:51.160 --> 47:53.879
you can have
your picture there, darling.

47:54.040 --> 47:56.315
I can help you.

47:56.480 --> 48:00.234
It takes focus and hard work,
but if you succeed...

48:01.320 --> 48:04.118
your name will live forever.

48:14.400 --> 48:16.516
Don't be smug, Seymore.

48:16.920 --> 48:18.990
Well, she's had plenty
of time.

48:19.160 --> 48:22.675
She traveled yesterday.
She slept in a strange bed.

48:23.280 --> 48:25.350
Give her a chance.

48:27.880 --> 48:30.189
At six years old,
she read Zimmer.

48:31.440 --> 48:32.589
Outstanding.

48:33.440 --> 48:35.670
How much did she comprehend?

48:37.600 --> 48:38.874
So, Mary...

48:39.920 --> 48:42.718
I see you're looking
at our little problem.

48:43.040 --> 48:45.235
Little? It's big.

48:46.000 --> 48:47.000
Yeah.

48:53.240 --> 48:54.958
Why are you so mad
all of a sudden?

48:55.160 --> 48:57.276
I'm not mad. I'm annoyed.

48:57.440 --> 48:58.475
Not with you, dear.

48:58.560 --> 49:00.835
With that pompous ass,
Shankland.

49:01.040 --> 49:02.758
I knew that guy was gonna
have a beard

49:02.840 --> 49:04.478
before we even went in there.

49:04.640 --> 49:06.631
Math teachers
like to grow beards.

49:06.800 --> 49:09.155
I should never have agreed
to this in the first place.

49:09.320 --> 49:10.673
Did he really expect you

49:10.800 --> 49:12.216
to just walk in
and be able to dissect...

49:12.240 --> 49:14.276
some random, massive problem?

49:14.440 --> 49:17.477
Not much to dissect,
if you ask me.

49:17.680 --> 49:19.033
Why do you say that?

49:19.120 --> 49:20.120
It was wrong.

49:21.120 --> 49:22.189
What?

49:22.360 --> 49:24.510
Well, for starters,

49:24.600 --> 49:26.750
he forgot the negative sign
on the exponent.

49:26.920 --> 49:28.990
It went downhill from there.

49:29.160 --> 49:30.718
The problem was unsolvable.

49:31.920 --> 49:35.196
Maybe this school isn't
as great as you think it is.

50:48.280 --> 50:49.918
Mary, you knew
the problem was incorrect.

50:50.000 --> 50:51.149
Why didn't you say anything?

50:51.360 --> 50:54.193
Frank says I'm not supposed to
correct older people.

50:56.120 --> 50:58.953
Nobody likes a smart-ass.

51:05.880 --> 51:08.030
I'm loaded with swag!

51:16.320 --> 51:17.548
Wanna come inside?

51:19.520 --> 51:20.520
Cat.

51:21.520 --> 51:23.670
Frank,
I think this is stupid.

51:23.840 --> 51:25.876
Why don't we just call Evelyn

51:25.960 --> 51:27.320
and tell her
I don't wanna do this?

51:27.360 --> 51:28.588
Because like I told you,

51:28.680 --> 51:30.240
Evelyn didn't order this.
The court did.

51:30.360 --> 51:31.793
So again,
what are we gonna do?

51:31.920 --> 51:32.955
Tell the truth.

51:33.040 --> 51:34.040
Exactly.

51:34.200 --> 51:35.456
Sooner we answer
these questions,

51:35.480 --> 51:36.549
sooner we get to go home.

51:36.640 --> 51:37.914
So, no attitude, okay?

51:38.080 --> 51:39.672
Okay.

51:41.560 --> 51:43.312
Frank?

51:43.480 --> 51:44.515
Mary.

51:45.840 --> 51:47.398
I like Evelyn.

51:47.560 --> 51:49.152
She looks like my mom.

51:49.320 --> 51:50.799
And she has a piano.

51:55.320 --> 51:57.629
But I don't wanna live
with her.

51:57.840 --> 51:58.989
She's bossy.

52:00.320 --> 52:02.356
I've heard that.

52:02.720 --> 52:04.039
Hey.

52:05.080 --> 52:07.719
Don't worry.
You're not going anywhere.

52:09.840 --> 52:10.840
Promise?

52:13.960 --> 52:15.279
I promise.

52:15.480 --> 52:17.516
Hi, Mary. I'm Pat Golding,

52:17.600 --> 52:19.000
but you can call me Pat
if you like.

52:19.080 --> 52:20.718
Got it.

52:20.880 --> 52:22.632
Do you know why you're here?

52:22.800 --> 52:25.109
I mean has anyone told you
what this is about?

52:25.280 --> 52:26.840
My grandmother wants me
to live with her

52:26.880 --> 52:28.154
and I wanna stay with Frank.

52:28.320 --> 52:30.231
That's correct.

52:30.400 --> 52:32.595
I'm sure this can all be
very scary stuff.

52:32.680 --> 52:34.511
Does any of it worry you?

52:34.680 --> 52:37.638
Nope. Frank says
I'm not goin' anywhere.

52:38.560 --> 52:40.360
Your uncle told you
you're not going anywhere?

52:40.480 --> 52:42.232
Just 15 minutes ago.

52:42.320 --> 52:43.355
So, we done here?

52:44.960 --> 52:46.359
Not quite yet.

52:46.880 --> 52:49.269
My best friend other than
Frank and Fred is Roberta...

52:49.440 --> 52:50.793
who lives
a couple houses away.

52:50.960 --> 52:52.075
Really? What's she like?

52:52.240 --> 52:55.391
She's nice and funny.
And I love her.

52:55.480 --> 52:57.948
That's nice.

52:58.120 --> 53:00.156
Is Roberta your only friend
your age?

53:00.480 --> 53:03.916
Roberta's not my age.
She's like 40, 50...

53:04.080 --> 53:05.718
30-something.

53:05.880 --> 53:07.677
Roberta's a grown woman?

53:07.840 --> 53:10.035
People my age are boring.

53:10.200 --> 53:11.872
Roberta's cool.

53:12.760 --> 53:13.875
Okay.

53:14.080 --> 53:15.195
I don't watch TV.

53:15.360 --> 53:17.510
But I got hooked on SpongeBob.

53:17.680 --> 53:19.636
Mostly because
Roberta loves it.

53:21.560 --> 53:24.597
Oh. And on Saturday nights,
we watch the UFC.

53:24.800 --> 53:26.756
The UFC? Is that...

53:26.920 --> 53:28.069
Is that Ultimate Fighting?

53:28.240 --> 53:30.196
Every Saturday.

53:30.360 --> 53:32.635
You and your uncle watch
Ultimate Fighting?

53:32.800 --> 53:35.075
Well, you don't just watch it.

53:35.440 --> 53:36.839
Frank turns the sound down

53:36.920 --> 53:38.638
and we do the grunting
and voices.

53:39.480 --> 53:40.515
Hmm.

53:40.600 --> 53:42.511
Sometimes I attack Frank
for real.

53:42.680 --> 53:44.671
Which is really fun for me.

53:44.840 --> 53:46.796
I think if you guys
knew Frank,

53:46.880 --> 53:48.359
you'd leave us alone.

53:49.000 --> 53:50.911
He can be pretty annoying...

53:51.120 --> 53:53.759
but he's a good person.

53:53.920 --> 53:55.069
I think.

53:56.280 --> 53:57.599
Why do you say that?

53:59.120 --> 54:01.429
He wanted me
before I was smart.

54:01.880 --> 54:03.233
Mr. Pollard, are you...

54:03.400 --> 54:06.119
the natural father
of Mary Adler?

54:06.280 --> 54:07.759
Yes, I am.

54:07.920 --> 54:09.478
And how can you be
certain of this?

54:09.960 --> 54:13.077
Well, I always knew,
but then you had me...

54:13.240 --> 54:14.719
take a DNA test.

54:14.880 --> 54:16.472
I would offer the test results

54:16.560 --> 54:18.676
as presumptive evidence
that Mr. Pollard...

54:18.840 --> 54:21.877
is the father and natural
guardian of the minor.

54:22.040 --> 54:23.519
As well as an affidavit...

54:23.680 --> 54:25.511
from Mr. Pollard nominating...

54:25.680 --> 54:27.671
Mrs. Adler,
the maternal grandmother,

54:27.760 --> 54:29.591
as the legal guardian
of the minor.

54:30.400 --> 54:31.435
No objections.

54:33.600 --> 54:35.272
Mr. Pollard...

54:35.440 --> 54:38.910
has Mrs. Adler offered you
any monetary reward...

54:39.080 --> 54:41.548
or employment
for coming forward today?

54:42.280 --> 54:44.555
No, sir.
I have a job of my own.

54:44.760 --> 54:45.760
Thank you.

54:45.840 --> 54:47.512
No further questions,
Your Honor.

54:47.720 --> 54:48.835
Mr. Pollard...

54:49.000 --> 54:51.355
when was the last time
you saw Mary?

54:52.640 --> 54:55.108
Uh... I've never seen her.

54:55.200 --> 54:56.474
Oh, why not?

54:56.600 --> 54:58.431
By the time
I heard about Diane...

54:59.320 --> 55:01.072
passing...

55:01.240 --> 55:03.037
the baby was gone already.

55:03.200 --> 55:05.395
Well, did you try
and find her?

55:06.480 --> 55:08.072
Best I could.

55:08.880 --> 55:11.189
I couldn't just go
and search the entire country.

55:11.360 --> 55:13.396
Do you use
a computer at work?

55:13.480 --> 55:14.480
Sure.

55:14.560 --> 55:16.391
You know what? Help me out.

55:17.960 --> 55:19.916
Here, let's google
"Mary Adler"

55:20.000 --> 55:22.355
and, uh, see what we find.

55:32.720 --> 55:34.119
You know what?

55:34.280 --> 55:35.872
Uh, you better add
her middle name.

55:36.400 --> 55:38.152
It'll narrow it down.

55:42.800 --> 55:44.074
Eileen.

55:52.000 --> 55:53.956
Yeah. Hit Enter.

55:54.560 --> 55:55.680
Page 2.

55:56.120 --> 55:57.235
Second hit.

55:58.000 --> 56:00.594
Would you please tell
the court what you see there?

56:00.760 --> 56:02.751
It's a newspaper article
called

56:02.880 --> 56:04.029
"Not So Terrible Twos."

56:04.200 --> 56:07.749
And one of them
is Mary Eileen Adler.

56:07.920 --> 56:09.592
Same name as your daughter.

56:09.800 --> 56:12.439
Born on the same day
as your daughter.

56:12.600 --> 56:14.591
With a photograph.

56:14.760 --> 56:16.416
Um, in your defense,
you'd never recognize it...

56:16.440 --> 56:18.136
- Your Honor, this is...
- Your Honor...

56:18.160 --> 56:20.310
if there's one thing here
that's sadly obvious...

56:20.520 --> 56:23.193
it's that Mr. Pollard
has never been

56:23.280 --> 56:24.918
a genuine guardian
of the minor...

56:25.080 --> 56:26.957
and his nomination
of Mrs. Adler

56:27.040 --> 56:28.598
is no less disingenuous.

56:33.920 --> 56:35.560
While the State of Florida
gives deference

56:35.600 --> 56:37.000
to nomination
by a natural parent...

56:37.200 --> 56:38.936
I'm inclined to side
with Mr. Cullen's laptop...

56:38.960 --> 56:40.188
at this time.

56:40.360 --> 56:41.475
Thank you, Your Honor.

56:53.960 --> 56:55.029
Don't gloat.

56:55.200 --> 56:56.872
Wouldn't dream of it.

56:57.040 --> 56:58.075
Walk you to your car?

56:58.240 --> 57:00.959
We've been so preoccupied,
I'm almost ashamed to ask.

57:01.120 --> 57:02.997
How's Walter?

57:04.120 --> 57:06.111
You wouldn't believe it
if I told you.

57:06.200 --> 57:07.200
Why?

57:07.280 --> 57:10.989
Well, your stepfather
is in Montana.

57:11.160 --> 57:12.957
He bought a ranch.

57:13.040 --> 57:14.040
Bullshit.

57:14.120 --> 57:16.918
Exactly. A man whose idea
of roughing it...

57:17.120 --> 57:19.953
is being too far from the ice
machine at the Ritz-Carlton...

57:20.160 --> 57:23.311
now owns a 1,000 acres
of grass and dung.

57:23.480 --> 57:26.074
Walter Price is a cowboy.

57:26.240 --> 57:28.276
Walter Price puts on
a Brooks Brothers suit

57:28.360 --> 57:29.554
to take out the garbage.

57:29.720 --> 57:32.917
He has a cowboy hat
and cowboy boots...

57:33.080 --> 57:35.355
and a horse
that doesn't know dressage.

57:35.520 --> 57:37.272
Is there some
logical reason for this?

57:37.440 --> 57:40.034
Midlife crisis, apparently.

57:40.640 --> 57:41.640
He's 70.

57:41.800 --> 57:42.949
I know.

57:43.680 --> 57:46.148
Must have been on time delay
or something.

57:46.960 --> 57:48.029
I guess I should be happy

57:48.120 --> 57:50.509
it wasn't a 25-year-old
cocktail waitress.

57:51.440 --> 57:52.668
But then again,

57:52.760 --> 57:54.990
an affair you can explain
to friends in a minute.

57:55.200 --> 57:58.590
For this, you put on
a pot of coffee.

58:00.200 --> 58:01.633
And he's out there right now?

58:01.800 --> 58:02.835
Yessiree!

58:02.920 --> 58:06.196
Ridin' the range.
Punchin' doggies.

58:06.360 --> 58:08.590
He had a six gun on his hip...

58:08.760 --> 58:11.672
and a saddlebag
full of Lipitor.

58:13.040 --> 58:16.191
The fastest asset management
in the West.

58:16.360 --> 58:18.794
The man who shot
Liberty Mutual.

58:19.880 --> 58:21.871
That's what I've been
calling him.

58:24.600 --> 58:27.558
That's really, really funny.

58:36.040 --> 58:37.996
Take her to the airport.

58:40.880 --> 58:42.598
Go home, Evelyn.

58:42.760 --> 58:45.069
Or Montana.
Rustle some cattle.

58:47.200 --> 58:48.200
You know...

58:49.280 --> 58:52.317
I have no desire to hurt you.

58:52.480 --> 58:54.436
I hate it that we're at odds.

58:56.400 --> 58:57.913
We're always at odds.

58:59.120 --> 59:00.235
Yes.

59:01.080 --> 59:02.479
Hotel.

59:06.400 --> 59:08.231
Mary, baby,
come on now.

59:08.320 --> 59:09.320
Stop this now.

59:09.680 --> 59:10.795
No.

59:10.960 --> 59:13.394
- Come on out, honey.
- No.

59:13.480 --> 59:15.376
Why did you have to tell her
that deadbeat was testifying?

59:15.400 --> 59:16.469
Because it's the truth.

59:16.560 --> 59:17.840
And if I didn't,
Evelyn would've.

59:17.960 --> 59:19.951
If I was the dad
of a little girl

59:20.040 --> 59:21.553
and I never saw her...

59:22.720 --> 59:24.950
and I was in the same town...

59:26.120 --> 59:27.439
I would visit her.

59:27.600 --> 59:29.079
Well, I hope you're happy.

59:32.920 --> 59:35.798
He didn't even
need directions.

59:35.960 --> 59:38.713
He could've followed you here.

59:39.480 --> 59:41.550
Speaking of men
who aren't worth a damn.

59:48.040 --> 59:51.237
Doesn't even wanna see
what I look like.

59:55.400 --> 59:56.469
All right.

59:56.560 --> 59:58.437
Hey, put your shoes on.
We're going for a ride.

59:58.560 --> 59:59.560
You too.

01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:01.633
A ride?

01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:04.675
What are we doing here?

01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:06.512
Waiting.

01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:07.749
We can see that.

01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:09.200
Why?

01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:11.552
Because I said so.

01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:16.712
How long do we have to
stay here?

01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:18.672
As long as it takes.

01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:21.952
And keep your voice down.
It's a hospital.

01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:27.235
- Food's here.
- Yeah, food's here.

01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:47.351
It's a boy.

01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:55.360
Way to go!

01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:07.157
That's exactly how it was
when you were born.

01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:10.073
This happy?

01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:11.759
This happy.

01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:22.154
Who came out
and told everybody?

01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:26.079
I did.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.036
Can we stay for another?

01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:30.280
Mrs. Adler, in your earlier
testimony, here today...

01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:32.590
you've painted a pretty dim
picture of your own son.

01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:33.795
Don't you think?

01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:35.518
I'm under oath.

01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:37.432
I take no pleasure in it.

01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:39.838
So, your son's
a failure in life,

01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:41.080
your daughter took her life.

01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:42.240
You know, you're oh for two.

01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:43.833
- Objection!
- Withdrawn.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.639
If I go one for three,
I'm in the Hall of Fame.

01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:49.751
You know baseball.

01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:50.920
Fenway Park.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:52.600
You know, I'd like to go there
some time.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.116
How often in a year

01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:56.838
did you take Diane
to a baseball game?

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.638
Diane wasn't interested
in sports.

01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:00.916
She never wanted to go
to a game? Ever?

01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:03.640
I don't recall her
ever asking.

01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:05.880
Just out of curiosity, Fenway,
that's a tough ticket.

01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:07.075
Where do you get yours?

01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:08.616
My husband has
season tickets.

01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:09.868
And how long has he had them?

01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:11.475
30 years.

01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:13.676
But I've only been
married to him for 20.

01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:15.910
And Diane never went
to one game?

01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:19.875
What color was the dress
Diane wore to prom?

01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:21.638
Diane didn't attend a prom

01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:22.776
because she didn't go
to a high school.

01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:23.800
No prom.

01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:24.989
What sports did she play?

01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:26.309
As I told you earlier,

01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:28.072
she wasn't interested
in sports.

01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:29.376
Did she go to camp
during the summer?

01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:30.435
No.

01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:32.670
- Community swimming pool?
- We had our own pool.

01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:34.119
- Girl Scouts?
- No.

01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:37.829
Then what did she do
with all that time?

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.468
She loved mathematics.
It was her passion.

01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:43.074
She preferred it
to all other things.

01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:44.468
All other?

01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:49.591
Mrs. Adler, who's Paul Riva?

01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:56.919
He was a boy
from the neighborhood.

01:04:57.120 --> 01:04:59.475
Oh, come on.
He was much more than...

01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:01.278
just a boy
from the neighborhood.

01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:02.998
Paul was Diane's first love...

01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:04.195
wasn't he?

01:05:04.280 --> 01:05:06.350
I wouldn't characterize it
that way. No.

01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:08.351
And how would Diane
characterize it?

01:05:08.520 --> 01:05:10.556
Diane was 17 years old
at the time.

01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:12.478
She didn't know anything
about love.

01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:14.309
Mrs. Adler...

01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:16.391
in January of 1998...

01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:19.558
didn't Diane and young
Mr. Riva run away together?

01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:20.720
He coerced her.

01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:22.313
- And where did they go?
- Vermont.

01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:23.880
And you called the police,
didn't you?

01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:25.416
- Because he kidnapped her?
- Yes. Yes.

01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:27.908
And where did the police
find young Mr. Riva and Diane?

01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:29.433
I told you. Vermont.

01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:31.352
Stowe, Vermont. Wasn't it?

01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:32.520
A resort town.

01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:34.670
Stowe Mountain.

01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:36.910
He took her skiing.

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:38.816
You see,
kidnappers don't usually

01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:40.239
take their victims skiing.

01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:44.234
But this is what Paul did...

01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:47.073
because he and Diane
were in love.

01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:48.160
No.

01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:49.468
And when they returned,

01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:51.471
you pressed
kidnapping charges.

01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:54.791
You filed a lawsuit
against his parents...

01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:56.996
until Paul stopped
calling Diane.

01:05:57.160 --> 01:05:58.479
- Didn't you?
- Yes.

01:05:58.680 --> 01:06:02.275
And Diane never heard from
or saw Paul Riva again.

01:06:02.360 --> 01:06:03.360
Did she?

01:06:03.480 --> 01:06:05.198
Not to my knowledge.

01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:09.078
And how did she take it?

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.355
She was upset for a while.

01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:13.669
She lost focus.

01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:16.591
She lost focus.

01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:19.320
Mrs. Adler,
in March of 1999...

01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:22.119
didn't Diane Adler attempt
to take her own life?

01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:24.236
This episode was minor.
It was nothing.

01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:26.789
I have the hospital report
in my hand.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.319
It was nothing.

01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:30.675
Diane was not like
regular people.

01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:32.074
She was extraordinary.

01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:33.559
And extraordinary people

01:06:33.640 --> 01:06:36.234
come with singular issues
and needs.

01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:39.517
You have no idea
the capability she possessed.

01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:41.393
One in a billion.

01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:44.353
And you would say, "Fine,
let's throw that away...

01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:48.599
"so the boy who cuts our yard
can make a sexual conquest."

01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:50.478
Maybe before you make
that decision,

01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:52.073
you stand in my shoes.

01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:54.674
I had responsibilities
which went beyond

01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:56.159
the mother-daughter
relationship.

01:06:56.360 --> 01:06:58.351
The greatest discoveries

01:06:58.440 --> 01:07:00.271
which have improved life
on this planet...

01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:03.671
have come from minds
rarer than radium.

01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:06.479
Without them,
we'd still be crawling in mud.

01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:09.200
And for your information,
counselor...

01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:12.158
a year after this incident
with this boy...

01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:14.550
Diane thanked me
for my intervention.

01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:17.474
She realized she'd made
a mistake and she thanked me.

01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:19.471
You see, Diane understood
she was accountable

01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:20.760
for the gift she'd been given.

01:07:20.920 --> 01:07:22.114
And she didn't shy from it.

01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:25.192
And I think, if she were
here today, Mr. Attorney...

01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:27.828
she would refute
your baseless insinuations...

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.680
that she would give up
her brilliant future

01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:30.829
and take her own life...

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:34.595
just because Mommy didn't
get her a little red wagon.

01:07:37.080 --> 01:07:38.638
No more questions.

01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:15.829
Mr. Adler...

01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:18.716
where are you
currently employed?

01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:19.880
I repair boats.

01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:21.756
Oh, really? At which marina?

01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:23.796
I don't work at a marina.
I freelance.

01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:25.951
So, safe to say,
no health insurance.

01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:27.160
No.

01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:29.376
About a week before
your sister took her life...

01:08:29.399 --> 01:08:30.992
what were you doing
for a living then?

01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:32.749
I was a teacher.

01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:34.576
You're being
modest, aren't you?

01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:36.555
You were a professor
at Boston University...

01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:37.788
isn't that right?

01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:39.836
Yes, well,
Assistant Professor.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:41.399
And what'd you teach?

01:08:41.479 --> 01:08:42.479
Philosophy.

01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:44.470
Truth and logic.
That sort of thing.

01:08:45.439 --> 01:08:47.670
Your attorney said
that the primary reason...

01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:50.308
that you took Mary is because
it was what your sister...

01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:52.828
would have wanted you to do.
Is that the truth?

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:54.000
Yes.

01:08:54.479 --> 01:08:56.200
So Diane had visited
Pinellas County before?

01:08:56.960 --> 01:08:57.960
No.

01:08:58.040 --> 01:08:59.176
Indicated she wanted
her daughter

01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:00.349
uprooted and moved here?

01:09:00.439 --> 01:09:02.192
- No.
- No.

01:09:02.359 --> 01:09:04.669
So, you decided to bring
Mary here, didn't you?

01:09:06.160 --> 01:09:07.388
Did Diane have a problem

01:09:07.479 --> 01:09:09.160
with your health plan
at Boston University?

01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:10.234
Not to my knowledge.

01:09:10.319 --> 01:09:11.416
Do you think she would want
her daughter

01:09:11.439 --> 01:09:12.576
to have access to healthcare?

01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:13.475
Of course.

01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:16.233
So what do you do,
when little Mary gets sick?

01:09:16.399 --> 01:09:17.832
You repair a doctor's boat?

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:19.796
- Objection.
- Sustained.

01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:21.828
Mary has been identified...

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.194
as a math prodigy.

01:09:24.359 --> 01:09:26.555
But her formal math education
under your care...

01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:28.910
she's learning at the
first grade level, isn't she?

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:30.035
Yes.

01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:32.634
And you turned down
a scholarship at the Oaks...

01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:36.029
a school specializing in the
education of gifted children?

01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:37.120
Yes.

01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:39.236
And Diane,
she'd be fine with that?

01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:42.229
I couldn't say.

01:09:42.399 --> 01:09:44.176
Prior to Mrs. Adler
giving her one,

01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:45.269
did Mary have a computer?

01:09:45.359 --> 01:09:46.395
She used mine.

01:09:46.479 --> 01:09:48.630
Mr. Adler, does Diane's
daughter have her own bedroom?

01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:49.755
No.

01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:51.536
Does she sleep
in a bed that you bought...

01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:52.993
- in a secondhand shop?
- Yes.

01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:55.674
So, the truth is, Mr. Adler,

01:09:55.840 --> 01:09:57.319
that you didn't come down here

01:09:57.400 --> 01:09:58.958
because your sister
wanted you to...

01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:00.256
and you certainly
didn't come here

01:10:00.280 --> 01:10:01.440
because it was good for Mary.

01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:03.277
No, it was personal.

01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:05.112
Diane was a star.
You weren't.

01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:06.952
Diane got the attention.
You didn't.

01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:08.519
And over the years,
you got angry.

01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:09.709
And here comes Mary.

01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:11.836
What a great way to get even.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:13.592
You've uprooted
that little girl

01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:15.352
and brought her here
for one reason only.

01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:17.391
To do harm to your mother.

01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:18.680
You blamed her
for your sister.

01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:19.829
No, I don't.

01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:21.576
And Mary to you is just a pawn
in all this. Isn't she?

01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:23.636
Diane wanted Mary...

01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:25.119
to be a kid.

01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:28.596
She wanted her to have a life.

01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:31.878
She wanted her
to have friends...

01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:34.272
and to play...

01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:36.595
and to be happy.

01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:38.910
Do you realize
the consequences

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:40.991
of boredom for a gifted child,
Mr. Adler?

01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:43.276
They become resentful
and sullen.

01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:44.475
Mary's not an angry kid.

01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:45.629
Really?

01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:47.716
Did she not attack a child
on the school bus?

01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:49.560
A 12-year-old tripped

01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:51.016
a 7-year-old
and she came to his defense.

01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:52.951
- Did she break the boy's nose?
- Yes.

01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:57.113
On October 16th of last year
were you arrested for assault?

01:10:57.280 --> 01:10:58.508
Oh, my God.

01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:00.840
You have to answer
the question, Mr. Adler.

01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:06.110
A drunk idiot attacked me
and I defended myself.

01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:07.376
What does that have to do
with anything?

01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:08.640
Did you spend the night
in jail?

01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:10.509
Yeah.

01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:12.636
You are in way
over your head here.

01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:14.233
You're depriving that girl.

01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:15.696
You're gambling
with her future...

01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:17.776
and now you're being presented
with an opportunity...

01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:18.976
to do right by her.
Jump at it.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:20.336
Does counsel
have a question for my client?

01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:21.759
Take the high road,
Mr. Adler...

01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:23.016
before she is
irreparably damaged.

01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:24.136
Does counsel
have a question...

01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:25.176
- for my client or not?
- Yes, sir.

01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:26.838
I do have the question.

01:11:28.520 --> 01:11:30.988
Tell us, is your
continued guardianship...

01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:34.311
really in the best interest
of this little girl?

01:11:41.240 --> 01:11:42.355
Yes.

01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:44.040
Yes, it is.

01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:46.551
I have
no further questions.

01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:55.416
Research
and Development...

01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:57.032
has come up
with a brand new Fred cheer.

01:11:57.200 --> 01:12:00.158
Fred personally asked me
if I would tell you it.

01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:02.197
Let's hear it.

01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:05.557
S-O-C-K I-T
Sock it to me, Freddy...

01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:08.029
Sock it.

01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:11.869
Sock it.

01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:17.158
Tell R and D,
they got a winner.

01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:19.470
That's exactly what I said.

01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:24.116
S-O-C-K I-T
Sock it to me, Freddy

01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:28.636
They wanna cut a deal.

01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:32.791
Highsmith called me
first thing this morning.

01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:34.560
Why would he do that?
I don't understand.

01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:35.953
In the middle of...

01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:38.549
Just listen.
Listen to me, man.

01:12:41.240 --> 01:12:44.596
Mary would be put
in a fostering situation.

01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:45.875
No.

01:12:46.040 --> 01:12:47.256
- Come on, Frank.
- Cullen, I told you no.

01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:48.633
It wouldn't be
a court-appointed

01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:50.034
foster family, Frank.

01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:51.616
- Hey! Drop it!
- We could cherry-pick...

01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:52.755
from the cream of the crop.

01:12:52.840 --> 01:12:54.478
Mutually approved.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:56.638
Just hear me out.

01:12:56.720 --> 01:12:57.755
Tampa.

01:12:57.840 --> 01:12:59.876
I insisted, and they agreed.

01:13:00.040 --> 01:13:02.634
No more than a half an hour
from your front door.

01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:04.711
Now, she would attend
the Oaks.

01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:06.518
It's a great school.

01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:08.320
And visiting rights
for the grandmother...

01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:09.873
but she was gonna
get that anyway.

01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:12.031
Right? And on her
12th birthday, Frank,

01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:13.394
she can go back into court...

01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:14.629
- No.
- and decide then...

01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:15.896
where she wants to live
and with who.

01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:16.796
I don't understand this.

01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:18.216
I thought you were supposed
to be on my team.

01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:19.416
Why are you bringing me
this deal?

01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:21.431
Other than
I'm required to by law?

01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:22.999
You like this deal?

01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:26.153
I love this deal.

01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:45.592
They think they're gonna lose.

01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:47.593
Yeah.

01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:48.875
They do.

01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:51.799
You think we're gonna lose.

01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:53.149
Yes.

01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:55.032
I do, Frank.

01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:05.320
I gotta go put my kids to bed.

01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:09.190
I'll do whatever
you want me to do.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:13.390
But if we leave this
up to that judge, Nichols...

01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:15.551
he's old school, Frank.

01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:17.830
Does he like your mother? No.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:19.319
Does he like her income?

01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:22.517
Does he like her health plan?
Does he like her home?

01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:24.636
You better believe it.

01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:26.518
I've been in his courtroom.

01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:28.238
A hundred times.

01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:31.197
And if it's a coin toss...

01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:32.515
Look at me.

01:14:35.480 --> 01:14:38.233
If it's a coin toss...

01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:42.313
that old boy is going to
side with the money.

01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:45.151
So, do me a favor, Frank.

01:14:45.320 --> 01:14:48.039
Just meet the family.
See how it feels.

01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:49.553
It's all I ask.

01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:09.949
Fly away, little pretty bird

01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:16.550
Fly, fly away...

01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:20.034
Pool. Florida.

01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:23.348
That dock
is on the Intercoastal.

01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:25.272
Which I guess is obvious...

01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:27.431
since we're on
the Intercoastal.

01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:32.270
Added this desk,
so she could do her homework.

01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:33.953
Yeah.

01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:36.435
And this would be her room.

01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:44.388
I see in your eyes a promise

01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:48.112
So, while I'm trying to
sell you on the house...

01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:49.952
and us...

01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:51.678
I just don't want you to think

01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:53.478
that we're
completely insensitive...

01:15:53.640 --> 01:15:55.312
to what you're feeling.

01:16:06.080 --> 01:16:08.548
You guys gonna be okay
with a cat?

01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:12.192
Absolutely.

01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:18.951
Love's own tender flames

01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:21.470
Warm this meeting

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:28.996
And love's tender song
you will sing

01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:34.271
But fly away...

01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:37.676
I've been thinking a lot
about the word "compromise."

01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:41.310
On one hand,
good challenging school...

01:16:41.480 --> 01:16:42.799
on the other...

01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:44.633
foster people.

01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:46.392
They can watch sitcoms
with her.

01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:48.471
Take her to Olive Garden.

01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:51.279
Teach her
to say "irregardless."

01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:53.158
The only saving grace,
I suppose,

01:16:53.240 --> 01:16:55.276
is she's better off
than she was.

01:16:58.160 --> 01:16:59.354
Well...

01:17:01.800 --> 01:17:03.392
Goodbye, Frank.

01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:18.392
Hey...

01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:20.118
come on.

01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:21.958
I'm only 25 minutes away.

01:17:22.120 --> 01:17:24.156
Please don't leave me here.

01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:25.719
- Please.
- No.

01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:28.315
Look, you're going to

01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:29.800
a brand new school,
a better school.

01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:31.712
I don't want to.

01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:33.029
I want my crummy school.

01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:34.428
- And you got Fred.
- Please.

01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:35.936
And once a month
you can come back.

01:17:35.960 --> 01:17:37.096
You can stay with me
and Roberta.

01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:39.156
I want you and Roberta now!

01:17:39.320 --> 01:17:41.072
And in a few years,
if you want...

01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:42.832
you can come back.
You can live with me.

01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:44.673
I wanna stay with you.

01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:46.319
Frank, you promised me.

01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:48.471
- Come on. Don't do this.
- You promised me.

01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:49.795
I know.

01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:51.629
I know.

01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:54.879
Please, Frank.
Why are you leaving me?

01:17:55.040 --> 01:17:57.998
Because the court said
I had to. You know this.

01:17:58.160 --> 01:17:59.991
We've discussed this
ad naus...

01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:05.078
We've discussed this. Come on.

01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:08.558
- Come on, please.
- No!

01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:09.755
- Hey, Mary.
- No!

01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:10.909
Hey, Mary.

01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:12.155
No! No!

01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:13.435
Sweetheart, you know what?

01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:14.669
No!

01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:16.279
There's no easy way
to do this.

01:18:16.440 --> 01:18:18.237
Not gonna be as long
as you think, honey.

01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:19.549
- Frank!
- You're gonna see.

01:18:19.720 --> 01:18:20.994
Frank!

01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:23.191
Don't leave me!

01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:25.430
- I know this is hard.
- Please!

01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:27.989
No! Get your hands off of me!

01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:30.116
- Frank! Please!
- I know it's hard.

01:18:30.280 --> 01:18:32.077
- Come back!
- Mary! I know.

01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:33.434
No!

01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:35.312
Frank!

01:18:35.800 --> 01:18:37.392
Don't go!

01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:40.398
I need you!

01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:42.869
Fred needs you!

01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:44.428
You promised me!

01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:52.235
No!

01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:08.278
Huh.

01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:33.439
Hey, down there.

01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:37.760
I don't know
which mistake is worse.

01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:39.358
Designing a water pump
that leaks...

01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:42.318
or putting it somewhere
no human being can reach.

01:19:46.360 --> 01:19:48.874
How do you design something
you know is gonna fail?

01:19:50.280 --> 01:19:53.272
Gotta be devious
or clueless, right?

01:19:58.640 --> 01:20:00.312
After the first few weeks,
I knew...

01:20:00.520 --> 01:20:02.511
I had to find
a real family for her.

01:20:05.680 --> 01:20:08.114
I was in way over my head.

01:20:11.560 --> 01:20:14.996
And every day, I'd say,
"Today's the day...

01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:17.031
"I'm takin' her
to child services."

01:20:17.200 --> 01:20:19.953
And every day,
she'd do something just...

01:20:23.520 --> 01:20:25.988
so unbelievably cool.

01:20:27.480 --> 01:20:30.153
Her little personality
was exploding.

01:20:32.080 --> 01:20:33.752
She was funny.

01:20:34.720 --> 01:20:37.439
And she was angry, and
she was happy, and she was...

01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:40.033
sad.

01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:42.429
And was cute.

01:20:44.280 --> 01:20:46.430
Just so damn entertaining.

01:20:46.600 --> 01:20:48.431
And so I kept her.

01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:50.113
Not that
that's in her best interest.

01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:52.914
Not that I'm capable
of raising a child.

01:20:53.080 --> 01:20:54.680
A child that might still
have a mother...

01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:57.188
if I had taken the time to
notice that she needed me.

01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:02.597
And now,
six and a half years later...

01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:04.637
I finally got her
to the foster family,

01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:06.039
and you know what?

01:21:06.200 --> 01:21:08.270
It was great. She loved it.

01:21:08.920 --> 01:21:10.956
I thought
it would be a nightmare...

01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:12.599
of abandonment and betrayal.

01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:14.870
But, turns out
it was a huge success.

01:21:16.160 --> 01:21:17.229
I'm a fucking hero.

01:21:23.520 --> 01:21:25.192
- Frank...
- No, Bonnie.

01:21:26.040 --> 01:21:27.792
I appreciate
everything you've done.

01:21:27.960 --> 01:21:29.188
Just...

01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:50.072
- Hey.
- Hi, Frank.

01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:54.356
We're having a little bit
of a problem in there.

01:21:54.720 --> 01:21:55.720
What?

01:21:55.880 --> 01:21:57.836
Uh, Mary's fine...

01:21:58.000 --> 01:21:59.877
but she's having
a little bit of a meltdown.

01:22:00.760 --> 01:22:02.910
Right. Let me talk to her.

01:22:03.080 --> 01:22:04.479
No, hang on.

01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:07.634
That's not a good idea.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:11.117
Your visit here is the reason
for the meltdown.

01:22:11.400 --> 01:22:12.515
What?

01:22:13.880 --> 01:22:15.871
She don't wanna see you.

01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:22.633
I'm sorry, man.

01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:25.038
This is predictable.

01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:27.714
You know, she needs time.

01:22:33.160 --> 01:22:34.798
Just give me five minutes
with her.

01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:36.679
I let you inside...

01:22:36.840 --> 01:22:38.558
then we're gonna
betray her trust

01:22:38.680 --> 01:22:40.159
and we have
an even bigger problem.

01:23:56.480 --> 01:23:57.799
Oh...

01:25:05.720 --> 01:25:07.119
- Hi.
- Hi! Can we help you?

01:25:07.240 --> 01:25:09.754
Yeah. Do you have a one-eyed
orange cat named Fred?

01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:13.159
We have a one-eyed cat,

01:25:13.240 --> 01:25:14.560
but I don't know
what his name is.

01:25:14.680 --> 01:25:15.999
Where?

01:25:16.160 --> 01:25:18.549
I don't know.
Today was his last day.

01:25:21.080 --> 01:25:22.638
Hey, you can't go back there.

01:25:26.280 --> 01:25:27.280
Hey.

01:25:29.720 --> 01:25:32.154
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what are you doing back here?

01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:38.516
I told him he couldn't.

01:25:42.880 --> 01:25:43.880
Hey, Fred.

01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:48.673
Who brought this cat in?

01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:51.195
Some guy. He said
it was an allergy issue.

01:25:54.360 --> 01:25:55.952
Evelyn.

01:26:38.120 --> 01:26:39.394
- Frank!
- Where's Evelyn?

01:26:39.560 --> 01:26:40.913
Evelyn? You mean your mother?

01:26:41.080 --> 01:26:42.638
- Yes.
- Kevin.

01:26:42.840 --> 01:26:44.159
Evelyn is in the guest house.

01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:46.390
Yeah, listen. I'm sorry, man.

01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:47.834
Frank, let me tell you,

01:26:47.920 --> 01:26:49.876
she was so helpful
with the tutors.

01:26:50.040 --> 01:26:51.268
- Mary was so distant.
- Hey!

01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:52.656
Look, we know
what you're up against.

01:26:52.680 --> 01:26:53.696
Do you want your life back?

01:26:53.720 --> 01:26:54.720
Go back inside.

01:26:59.800 --> 01:27:00.994
What are you doing here?

01:27:03.480 --> 01:27:04.833
Come on, Mary.
We're goin' home.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.514
- No.
- You're trespassing!

01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:10.793
You need to look at this.

01:27:11.400 --> 01:27:12.400
Let's go, Mary.

01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:13.589
- Let's move. Come on.
- No!

01:27:13.680 --> 01:27:14.749
- Hey! Mary.
- Mary!

01:27:14.920 --> 01:27:15.989
Mary!

01:27:16.200 --> 01:27:18.475
- It's okay. I got her.
- Uh-uh!

01:27:20.360 --> 01:27:22.510
Think again, lady.

01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:46.315
Mary!

01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:48.630
Mary! Hey, stop it.

01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:50.153
No! Let me go!

01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:51.389
No!

01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:53.232
- No! No!
- Stop, Mary!

01:27:53.400 --> 01:27:54.833
- Stop. Stop.
- No!

01:27:55.040 --> 01:27:56.473
- Come here.
- You lied to me!

01:27:56.640 --> 01:27:57.640
I know!

01:27:57.760 --> 01:28:00.274
- No! No!
- Stop! Stop, stop!

01:28:00.520 --> 01:28:01.794
I'm sorry.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.594
I made a mistake.
I'm so sorry.

01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:05.915
You promised me.

01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:07.149
I know.

01:28:07.320 --> 01:28:08.469
You promised.

01:28:08.560 --> 01:28:10.835
I know. I'm sorry.

01:28:12.160 --> 01:28:13.593
You said
you wouldn't leave me.

01:28:13.880 --> 01:28:15.393
I made a mistake.

01:28:16.440 --> 01:28:18.635
I'm sorry.

01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:23.796
I was so sad!

01:28:25.080 --> 01:28:26.149
I missed you.

01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:27.952
I missed you, too.

01:28:29.160 --> 01:28:30.878
They took Fred.

01:28:31.040 --> 01:28:33.554
No. It's okay.

01:28:33.720 --> 01:28:36.473
- I got him. He's home.
- What?

01:28:36.640 --> 01:28:39.154
He's at the apartment
right now. I got him.

01:28:39.840 --> 01:28:41.034
For real?

01:28:41.160 --> 01:28:44.755
Yeah. He's home kicking around
his ping pong ball.

01:28:45.840 --> 01:28:47.876
Why did you leave me there?

01:28:49.440 --> 01:28:51.670
Because I thought
I was bad for you.

01:28:52.800 --> 01:28:54.313
And then it dawned on me.

01:28:54.480 --> 01:28:56.914
If Mary is this amazing...

01:28:57.080 --> 01:29:00.197
smart, sweet human being...

01:29:00.360 --> 01:29:02.430
then I must be
doing something right.

01:29:10.880 --> 01:29:13.155
You're smiling.

01:29:24.920 --> 01:29:26.638
Roberta!

01:29:27.560 --> 01:29:28.595
Oh, baby.

01:29:28.680 --> 01:29:30.591
Of all the stunts
you could pull.

01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:33.118
- Where are they going?
- Nowhere.

01:29:33.280 --> 01:29:34.349
Not yet.

01:29:35.440 --> 01:29:36.759
You two, out!

01:29:43.160 --> 01:29:44.576
- What is this?
- Do you want to know...

01:29:44.600 --> 01:29:45.696
how Diane told me
she finished?

01:29:45.720 --> 01:29:47.711
What is this
unconscionable lie?

01:29:47.880 --> 01:29:49.108
I walked into her apartment

01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:50.296
and she was sitting
on the floor...

01:29:50.320 --> 01:29:51.360
with that baby in her arms

01:29:51.440 --> 01:29:52.576
and you know
what she said to me?

01:29:52.600 --> 01:29:54.079
Admit it. You made this up.

01:29:54.280 --> 01:29:55.759
- She said, "What do I do now?"
- No.

01:29:55.920 --> 01:29:57.273
It is not a completed proof...

01:29:57.440 --> 01:30:00.079
- It is.
- No! It isn't! It can't be.

01:30:00.240 --> 01:30:01.468
Evelyn, stop!

01:30:03.040 --> 01:30:04.519
I'm taking Mary
and I'm raising her

01:30:04.600 --> 01:30:06.113
how I believe Diane
would've wanted.

01:30:06.280 --> 01:30:07.496
- We'll see about that later.
- I realize...

01:30:07.520 --> 01:30:08.839
she's not normal.

01:30:08.920 --> 01:30:10.956
But if Einstein can
ride a bike, so can she.

01:30:11.120 --> 01:30:13.588
Let's just say Diane didn't
tell me, which is nonsense...

01:30:13.800 --> 01:30:14.994
it's a Millennium Problem.

01:30:15.080 --> 01:30:16.911
She would have shared it
with the world.

01:30:17.080 --> 01:30:18.832
That's where
your charade falls apart.

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:20.956
If she had
completed the proof,

01:30:21.040 --> 01:30:22.439
she would have published it.

01:30:25.480 --> 01:30:27.755
Diane instructed me
very clearly.

01:30:30.400 --> 01:30:32.356
That I was only to publish it
postmortem.

01:30:32.960 --> 01:30:34.598
She died six years ago.

01:30:37.560 --> 01:30:39.471
It wasn't her death
she was talking about.

01:30:59.960 --> 01:31:02.155
I tried to talk her out of it.

01:31:03.720 --> 01:31:05.119
But you know
how Diane could be

01:31:05.200 --> 01:31:07.031
when she made her mind up
about something.

01:31:08.720 --> 01:31:10.438
I called MIT.

01:31:10.520 --> 01:31:11.600
Shankland's out of his mind

01:31:11.680 --> 01:31:13.671
about the possibility
of publishing it with you.

01:31:15.080 --> 01:31:16.513
He's waiting for your call.

01:31:17.440 --> 01:31:19.536
You're gonna be spending the
next few years of your life...

01:31:19.560 --> 01:31:20.993
defending it.

01:31:21.440 --> 01:31:22.953
You won't have time for her.

01:31:29.280 --> 01:31:30.952
What if I say no?

01:31:37.480 --> 01:31:39.232
Back to Plan A.

01:31:43.240 --> 01:31:45.595
Wait for me to die?

01:31:50.200 --> 01:31:53.317
I know Diane was hard.

01:31:56.560 --> 01:31:57.913
I know she was angry.

01:31:59.520 --> 01:32:02.034
But something really good
came out of this, Evelyn.

01:32:05.880 --> 01:32:07.552
She needs you now.

01:32:08.440 --> 01:32:10.510
You're the best woman
for the job.

01:32:11.120 --> 01:32:12.519
Take it.

01:32:17.640 --> 01:32:21.315
It doesn't seem as though
Diane wanted me to have it.

01:32:25.560 --> 01:32:27.676
Diane didn't always
think things through.

01:32:32.640 --> 01:32:33.834
I'll be outside.

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:36.319
Let me know what you wanna do.

01:33:56.800 --> 01:33:57.896
You've reached

01:33:57.920 --> 01:34:00.354
the Department
of Mathematics at MIT.

01:34:00.520 --> 01:34:01.919
If you know
your party's extension,

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.070
you may dial it at any time.

01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:06.872
If you wish to speak
to an operator...

01:34:06.960 --> 01:34:08.029
please stay on the line

01:34:08.160 --> 01:34:10.435
and someone will be with you
as soon as possible.

01:34:17.680 --> 01:34:20.069
Good
afternoon, MIT Mathematics,

01:34:20.160 --> 01:34:21.309
how may I direct your call?

01:34:22.680 --> 01:34:25.069
Hello? I'm sorry.
I can't hear you very well.

01:34:25.240 --> 01:34:27.071
No! No.

01:34:27.840 --> 01:34:29.796
Yeah. There you are.

01:34:29.960 --> 01:34:31.234
Yeah, can I help you?

01:34:31.400 --> 01:34:32.594
Uh, yes.

01:34:35.280 --> 01:34:37.032
Doctor Shankland.

01:34:37.560 --> 01:34:39.710
I'm really sorry.
I can't hear you.

01:34:39.880 --> 01:34:41.711
Could you speak up, please?

01:34:44.760 --> 01:34:45.795
Hello?

01:34:49.680 --> 01:34:52.035
Evelyn Adler...

01:34:52.200 --> 01:34:54.111
for Seymore Shankland, please.

01:34:56.160 --> 01:34:57.416
And what I want you to notice,

01:34:57.440 --> 01:34:58.873
is that when you
compute P of N...

01:34:59.040 --> 01:35:00.951
for N congruent
to four mod five...

01:35:01.120 --> 01:35:03.839
the answer
is a multiple of five.

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:05.877
So, the first person
to notice this

01:35:05.960 --> 01:35:07.075
was Srinivasa Ramanujan.

01:35:07.240 --> 01:35:08.798
In the beginning
of the 20th century...

01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:11.315
he proved that
it was the case for all...

01:35:11.480 --> 01:35:13.357
numbers congruent
to four mod five.

01:35:13.560 --> 01:35:16.518
So, he proved
that P of five N plus four...

01:35:16.680 --> 01:35:18.830
is congruent
to zero mod seven...

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.594
and that P of eleven N
plus six

01:35:21.680 --> 01:35:23.511
is congruent
to zero mod eleven.

01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:28.635
Good?

01:35:33.520 --> 01:35:35.112
You drive
like an old lady.

01:35:35.280 --> 01:35:36.720
It's Florida.
I'm blending in.

01:35:37.720 --> 01:35:39.073
How was school?

01:35:39.440 --> 01:35:41.192
Hmm, fun.

01:35:41.360 --> 01:35:43.828
Not like regular school fun...

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:45.672
but interesting.

01:35:48.840 --> 01:35:50.637
What is this book?

01:35:50.800 --> 01:35:53.758
Discourse on Method.
René Descartes.

01:35:54.360 --> 01:35:55.873
What's it about?

01:35:56.040 --> 01:35:57.553
Existence.

01:35:57.640 --> 01:35:58.755
Existence?

01:35:58.840 --> 01:36:01.877
Yup. "I think,
therefore I am."

01:36:02.440 --> 01:36:03.998
Well, of course you are.

01:36:04.080 --> 01:36:05.559
That's obvious.

01:36:08.480 --> 01:36:12.439
I think about Fred,
therefore, I am.

01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:14.670
Cogito ergo Fred?

01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:18.355
He's a dude and he's a guy.

01:36:18.520 --> 01:36:21.512
And he only has one eye.

01:36:23.160 --> 01:36:25.628
Fred, Fred, Fred!

01:36:26.600 --> 01:36:28.352
Freddy, Fred, Fred!

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:34.513
All right, here we are.

01:36:34.720 --> 01:36:36.551
Hey! Wait till
I come to a stop.

01:36:36.720 --> 01:36:39.075
Then come
to a stop already!

01:37:10.080 --> 01:37:13.959
A new wind is
blowing through these streets

01:37:15.760 --> 01:37:19.150
Those cold days
are history to us

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:25.072
I'm not sayin'
times they won't get tough

01:37:27.960 --> 01:37:31.032
We still got each other
That's enough

01:37:34.160 --> 01:37:37.470
I know life
ain't simple for you, dear

01:37:39.960 --> 01:37:43.111
But I'm here,
and I'm not going anywhere

01:37:46.120 --> 01:37:49.032
I'm not sayin'
I know how you feel

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:55.276
I just know
that I can help you deal

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.434
Don't lose your mind

01:37:59.840 --> 01:38:02.479
Don't lose your good heart

01:38:02.920 --> 01:38:05.036
Just know this time

01:38:05.960 --> 01:38:11.114
That you'll be waking up
in all these better days

01:38:11.560 --> 01:38:14.996
This is how you walk on

01:38:17.640 --> 01:38:20.632
This is where you belong

01:38:23.440 --> 01:38:28.514
I'm not sayin'
this isn't where you 'll stay

01:38:29.560 --> 01:38:32.472
But this is how you walk on

01:38:32.800 --> 01:38:35.598
This is how you walk on

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:46.675
The warm light of the evening
sings so sweet

01:38:49.040 --> 01:38:52.999
Cold grass
underneath your dancin' feet

01:38:54.600 --> 01:38:58.149
These simple things
mean more than I can say

01:39:00.640 --> 01:39:04.872
These moments make up
for our past dark days

01:39:05.960 --> 01:39:08.349
Don't lose your mind

01:39:08.880 --> 01:39:11.030
Don't lose your good heart

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:13.638
Just know this time

01:39:14.960 --> 01:39:20.114
That you'll be waking up
in all these better days

01:39:20.480 --> 01:39:23.756
This how you walk on

01:39:26.560 --> 01:39:29.597
This is where you belong

01:39:32.640 --> 01:39:37.919
I'm not sayin'
this isn't where you'll stay

01:39:38.440 --> 01:39:41.398
But this is how you walk on

01:39:41.480 --> 01:39:44.392
This is how you walk on

01:40:08.480 --> 01:40:11.438
This is how you walk on

01:40:14.480 --> 01:40:17.916
This is where you belong

01:40:20.440 --> 01:40:25.434
I'm not saying
this isn't where you'll stay

01:40:26.560 --> 01:40:29.279
But this is how you walk on

01:40:29.480 --> 01:40:32.472
This is how you walk on

01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:35.832
This is how you walk on

01:40:38.400 --> 01:40:42.313
This is where you belong

01:40:44.320 --> 01:40:49.997
I'm not saying
this isn't where you'll stay

01:40:50.560 --> 01:40:53.632
But this is how you walk on

01:40:53.880 --> 01:40:57.031
This is how you walk on

01:40:58.305 --> 01:41:04.152
