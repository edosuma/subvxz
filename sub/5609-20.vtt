NARRATOR: Previously on
Once Upon A Time...

00:03.295 --> 00:05.035
You want to come
with me to Storybrooke?

00:05.130 --> 00:09.715
All I care about is a future
where we might be a family.

00:09.801 --> 00:11.211
CORA: You were sisters once.

00:11.386 --> 00:13.547
Just promise me
you'll hold on to each other.

00:13.680 --> 00:15.671
I think you have another love to find.

00:15.766 --> 00:17.131
Hades.

00:17.809 --> 00:19.015
Go to him.

00:24.024 --> 00:25.525
You told her what?

00:26.235 --> 00:27.566
To give him a chance.

00:27.653 --> 00:29.644
And you thought
that was a good idea because...

00:29.738 --> 00:34.732
Because we're family.
And I'm trying to trust Zelena.

00:34.826 --> 00:36.691
She thinks she can change Hades.

00:36.787 --> 00:39.028
I'm sorry. Have I missed the part
where Zelena changed?

00:39.122 --> 00:40.908
You'd think the ex-pirate
with a rum habit

00:40.999 --> 00:42.614
would cut my sister some slack.

00:42.709 --> 00:44.370
Well, you'd think that the Evil Queen
would be smarter

00:44.461 --> 00:47.328
than to send the Wicked Witch
to romance the most devious man alive.

00:47.422 --> 00:49.458
Easy, guys, we're not gonna
win the war against Hades

00:49.550 --> 00:51.086
if we use all our ammo on each other.

00:51.176 --> 00:52.507
HADES: The Savior has a point.

00:54.054 --> 00:55.214
What the hell are you doing here?

00:55.305 --> 00:56.841
Get behind me, kid.

00:56.932 --> 00:59.264
Oh, I didn't find you to hurt you.

00:59.351 --> 01:00.807
I came for your...

01:02.229 --> 01:03.594
(SIGHS) Wow.

01:03.897 --> 01:05.762
This is hard.

01:07.150 --> 01:08.310
Help.

01:08.402 --> 01:10.313
What could you possibly
want our help with?

01:10.404 --> 01:11.519
Simple.

01:11.613 --> 01:15.697
I went to meet Zelena for our date
and found this.

01:21.707 --> 01:22.787
No.

01:24.918 --> 01:27.159
Zelena, she's been kidnapped
by Gold and Pan.

01:27.254 --> 01:29.336
They're asking for a meeting
tomorrow morning.

01:29.423 --> 01:31.914
Gold wants you to tear up the contract
for his unborn child.

01:32.009 --> 01:33.124
So do it.

01:33.218 --> 01:34.833
| just got my sister back.

01:34.928 --> 01:36.304
I'm not going to lose her now.

01:36.388 --> 01:37.594
Neither will I.

01:37.681 --> 01:38.796
I'll give them what they want.

01:38.849 --> 01:41.056
But I know the Stiltskins
and their tricks.

01:41.143 --> 01:44.806
They're not going to keep their word.
Not unless I have an ace up my sleeve.

01:44.896 --> 01:47.103
Luckily for you, you got one.

01:47.190 --> 01:51.524
I'm sorry, you've been Zelena's
doting sister for all of, what,

01:51.612 --> 01:52.601
three hours? No.

01:52.696 --> 01:55.438
Who's going to be
more motivated than me?

01:56.033 --> 01:57.022
Emma.

01:57.159 --> 01:58.774
What? Why?

01:58.869 --> 02:04.034
lf Zelena gets out of this alive,
I'm prepared to offer you a deal.

02:04.207 --> 02:05.947
Don't trust a word he says, Emma.

02:06.043 --> 02:07.704
REGINA: Now I agree with the pirate.

02:07.794 --> 02:12.879
You and I both know your family
wouldn't be here if it weren't for you.

02:14.635 --> 02:17.877
If you help me save her,

02:18.013 --> 02:21.881
I'll take everyone's names
off their headstones.

02:23.644 --> 02:26.556
So we can leave the Unden/vorld.

02:26.647 --> 02:29.059
So what do you say, Savior?

02:29.191 --> 02:33.480
Do you want to send
your family home or not?

02:52.005 --> 02:53.916
So, Ijust thought I'd ask,
on the off-chance

02:54.007 --> 02:55.213
that there's someone still working here

02:55.258 --> 02:56.589
who remembers
that baby being brought in.

02:56.677 --> 02:58.588
Twenty-six years ago?

02:58.720 --> 03:00.927
We can't keep a cook for six weeks.

03:01.056 --> 03:02.546
Maybe, like, a long-time customer.

03:02.599 --> 03:04.931
The food ain't good enough
for that kind of loyalty.

03:05.060 --> 03:08.177
Sorry, hon, but you're not gonna find
anyone here who remembers this.

03:19.574 --> 03:20.609
CLEO: Tough break, kid.

03:21.368 --> 03:22.483
What?

03:23.203 --> 03:25.285
Heard what you were asking.
You a reporter or something?

03:26.039 --> 03:27.870
No. Nothing like that.

03:28.792 --> 03:30.077
You're the baby, aren't you?

03:30.961 --> 03:33.543
In the article. You're the baby, right?

03:33.630 --> 03:35.461
Intuition. Mine's usually pretty good.

03:35.590 --> 03:38.548
And I'm sorry. It's hard
not being able to find your family.

03:38.635 --> 03:40.921
It's just a dead end.
I've had a lot of those.

03:40.971 --> 03:42.802
So, thanks for your concern,
but I got this.

03:42.931 --> 03:45.764
Can I say one more thing,
based on my intuition?

03:46.643 --> 03:47.632
Okay.

03:48.395 --> 03:51.478
I look at you, young, pretty...

03:52.149 --> 03:53.559
Okay.

03:53.650 --> 03:56.562
And | see someone who...
Now, stop me if I'm wrong,

03:58.155 --> 03:59.270
but someone who stole money

03:59.322 --> 04:01.108
from a couple convenience stores
in Phoenix,

04:01.158 --> 04:02.989
got arrested, and took off on her bail.

Well, hello there.

04:58.048 --> 04:59.458
Show yourself.

05:03.595 --> 05:06.587
Glad to see you followed instructions
and came alone.

05:06.681 --> 05:08.137
Zelena.

05:08.225 --> 05:09.635
I tried to stop them, but...

05:10.644 --> 05:12.635
It's not your fault. It's theirs.

05:12.729 --> 05:13.889
Oh, is that so?

05:14.815 --> 05:15.895
Because we wouldn't be here

05:16.024 --> 05:18.731
if you'd ripped up that contract
when I asked you to.

05:20.403 --> 05:22.735
You didn't have leverage.

05:23.740 --> 05:25.731
And now I do.

05:25.826 --> 05:28.533
So you stand there and don't move.

05:29.496 --> 05:31.578
Except to rip up that contract.

05:31.706 --> 05:33.742
Then you get the witch.

05:41.091 --> 05:42.752
There.

05:42.843 --> 05:44.253
Now, give her back.

05:44.386 --> 05:46.172
Oh, you can have her back.

05:46.263 --> 05:48.504
But we didn't say anything
about her heart, did we?

05:51.184 --> 05:53.345
See, my body is ready
to walk the earth again,

05:53.436 --> 05:55.051
except for one thing.

05:55.105 --> 05:56.265
A living heart.

05:56.356 --> 05:57.436
So, if you don't mind...

05:57.524 --> 06:00.266
My heart has got a protection spell on it.

06:00.485 --> 06:02.897
You may be good at magic.
But we're better.

06:09.452 --> 06:11.943

you couldn't get in.

06:12.038 --> 06:13.699
Locks don't bother me much.

06:13.790 --> 06:15.451
He ripped up the contract
like you wanted. So leave.

06:15.542 --> 06:17.703
Since when does the Savior
answer to the King of Death?

06:17.794 --> 06:20.080
Since he's the one
getting my family home.

06:20.130 --> 06:21.745
You picked the wrong team
to back, Ms. Swan.

06:21.798 --> 06:23.379
You won't get what you want from him.

06:23.466 --> 06:24.967
Really? Because you just did.

06:25.051 --> 06:27.133
Which is making me wonder
why you're still here.

06:30.974 --> 06:32.464
Yeah, I suppose you have a point.

06:34.895 --> 06:35.930
-Rumple...

06:53.455 --> 06:56.322
You tore up that contract for me.

06:56.416 --> 06:57.826
I didn't think you'd do it.

06:57.918 --> 07:01.786
When will you believe
I'd do anything for you?

07:32.035 --> 07:35.698
My banishment, it's over.

07:35.789 --> 07:38.371
I can finally leave this place for good.

07:39.793 --> 07:42.000
Very soon, at the cemetery,

07:42.045 --> 07:44.878
there will be a fully-formed portal
back to Storybrooke.

07:44.965 --> 07:46.546
But it will close at sunset.

07:46.633 --> 07:47.668
First things first.

07:48.551 --> 07:50.382
I held up my end of the deal.

07:50.470 --> 07:51.801
Now it's your turn.

07:53.556 --> 07:55.717
We're going home
through that portal, too.

07:55.809 --> 07:56.969

DAVID: How'd it get here?

08:08.405 --> 08:10.566
The hands are moving.
Is that a good sign or a bad one?

08:10.699 --> 08:13.486
It's a great one if you want to leave.

08:13.576 --> 08:14.861
When those hands spin fast enough,

08:14.911 --> 08:17.869
in about an hour,
it'll turn into an open portal back.

08:17.914 --> 08:20.576
Which we can't go through
because of those.

08:22.085 --> 08:24.576
So, let's get on with it.

08:24.713 --> 08:25.702
Gladly.

08:31.386 --> 08:33.923
There. As promised.

08:34.055 --> 08:35.716
You're no longer tied to this realm.

08:35.765 --> 08:37.175
I told you love could change him.

08:37.267 --> 08:38.256
I don't buy it.

08:38.393 --> 08:40.349
A man can't change that quickly.

08:40.437 --> 08:42.098
EMMA: We're free to go through
the portal when it opens.

08:42.230 --> 08:45.267
Which means it's time to split my heart
so you can leave with us.

08:46.026 --> 08:47.015
Aye, love.

08:49.362 --> 08:50.442

(GASPS) Why didn't it work?

09:08.965 --> 09:10.421
I told you we couldn't trust him.

09:10.467 --> 09:11.456
That wasn't me.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.792
I'm afraid there are laws of nature

09:19.726 --> 09:21.967
Aha. I didn't think I recalled you
entering this realm.

09:22.103 --> 09:24.640
Your soul never left your body,
that's why it worked for you.

09:24.731 --> 09:26.096
So, Hook's been down here too long?

09:26.149 --> 09:27.935
And his body's rotting away up there.

09:27.984 --> 09:30.225

could stomach the smell.

you have to return without me.

has a file on me. I didn't know that.

11:30.106 --> 11:31.141

They could know the name
of the boy who brought me in.

that was dropped into the file.

11:35.445 --> 11:37.060
Something, anything.
You could take me there.

11:37.113 --> 11:38.273
Why would I do that?

11:38.406 --> 11:39.816
Because I can get out of handcuffs,

11:39.949 --> 11:41.280
and you'll have to track me down
in every city,

11:41.409 --> 11:43.274
in every hotel,
all the way across the country?

11:46.456 --> 11:49.914

I'll go quietly all the way to Phoenix.

She died and he followed her
to the Unden/vorld to get her back.

12:16.986 --> 12:19.147
These are the only two souls
who ever escaped my realm.

12:19.280 --> 12:20.486
But how?

12:20.615 --> 12:21.946
I thought you said
that broke the laws of nature.

12:21.991 --> 12:25.859
Orpheus helped Eurydice escape
by feeding her Ambrosia,

12:25.995 --> 12:27.030
the food of the gods.

12:27.163 --> 12:29.620
And where exactly
do you get some of that?

Because I don't recall seeing it
on the menu at the Blind Witch's.

12:37.799 --> 12:40.131
An elevator?
I'm the Savior. I've got magic.

12:40.176 --> 12:42.633
And I'm the Lord of the UndenNorld.
That should tell you something.

12:42.679 --> 12:44.715
The Ambrosia? It's powerful,

12:44.847 --> 12:48.510
and like a petty spoiled child,
it wants all the power for itself.

12:48.559 --> 12:50.845
Everything else is shut down below.

12:50.895 --> 12:53.352
There's no hopping in and out
in a puff of smoke.

12:53.398 --> 12:55.013
This is the only way.

12:55.066 --> 12:56.727
And once you're down there,
you're on your own.

12:56.859 --> 12:59.350
And then what? We're knee-deep
in a field of Ambrosia?

12:59.404 --> 13:02.066
-It can't be that easy.
-l'm not really sure.

13:02.198 --> 13:04.189
Even I've never ventured that far down.

13:04.242 --> 13:07.700
So we're going to the one place in hell
where even the devil is afraid to go.

13:07.829 --> 13:09.990
Not hell. And not the devil.

13:10.039 --> 13:11.870
And not because I'm afraid.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.207
There's a test to ensure that only those

13:14.335 --> 13:16.872
who are worthy of eating Ambrosia
can reach it.

13:16.921 --> 13:20.834
And it will require offering up
your heart forjudgment.

13:20.883 --> 13:22.214
Without magic, how am I gonna
take out my own...

13:22.302 --> 13:23.291
(GRUNTS)

13:24.512 --> 13:25.877
You're not.

13:26.014 --> 13:29.723
My gift to you.

13:29.851 --> 13:31.512
Take good care of it.

13:31.561 --> 13:33.677
Let's have this be the last time
we do this today, okay?

13:33.730 --> 13:35.436
Just trying to help.

13:35.565 --> 13:39.729
So, failing this test has,
what, fatal consequences?

13:40.153 --> 13:41.438
One would think.

13:41.529 --> 13:43.611
You don't have to do this, Swan.

13:43.740 --> 13:44.900
And you didn't
have to sacrifice your life

13:44.949 --> 13:46.530
to save all of us from the Dark Ones.

13:46.576 --> 13:48.362
We're going.

13:48.411 --> 13:49.901
We'll be right here waiting for you.

13:51.247 --> 13:53.283
-Regina...
-I know the drill.

13:53.416 --> 13:54.747
If you're not back by sunset...

13:54.792 --> 13:56.532
Everybody leaves. Promise me.

13:56.586 --> 13:57.871
You'll be back.

13:57.920 --> 13:59.080
I love you, Mom.

She may not accept you
for who you are, but I will.

14:54.936 --> 14:57.427
Despite your rude
abandonment of me earlier.

14:59.315 --> 15:01.476
Touching, Papa.

15:01.526 --> 15:04.108
Yes, abandonment hurts, doesn't it?

15:06.948 --> 15:09.655
But with the contract gone,
I only care about one thing.

15:10.201 --> 15:12.533
Getting Belle home
so her father can wake her.

15:13.162 --> 15:14.698
I'd love to help you make the journey.

15:15.957 --> 15:17.197
But that's going to be quite difficult,

15:17.333 --> 15:18.948
since I didn't get the heart
you promised me.

15:19.001 --> 15:21.037
(LAUGHS) Oh, there's the man
I remember.

15:22.171 --> 15:24.833
Always thinking about
what's in it for himself.

15:24.882 --> 15:26.838
(CHUCKLES) There's something in it
for you, too.

15:29.846 --> 15:31.336
Pandora's Box.

15:32.014 --> 15:34.346
You can keep her safe in here
in exchange for a heart.

15:34.809 --> 15:38.677
OthenNise, you both might lose out
and miss that portal home.

15:40.356 --> 15:43.519
Opening soon, but only till sunset.

15:43.568 --> 15:46.685
So, do we have a deal?

15:48.239 --> 15:49.820
Tick, tock.

15:57.039 --> 15:59.906
(SIGHS) We can't just sit around
waiting for them to get back.

16:00.042 --> 16:01.703
We don't have a choice, Henry.

16:01.752 --> 16:04.664
The minute Emma and Hook
get off this elevator,

16:04.714 --> 16:06.329
we're going straight through that portal.

16:06.382 --> 16:08.213
What about Operation Firebird?

16:08.259 --> 16:09.374
We can't leave the Unden/vorld

16:09.427 --> 16:11.042
without helping the people trapped here.

16:11.179 --> 16:13.511
They were trapped here
because of Hades.

16:13.556 --> 16:16.389
Who, fortunately for them,
will no longer be a resident.

16:16.517 --> 16:19.008
She's right. The Unden/vorld will
function as it was meant to,

16:19.061 --> 16:21.222
a place for people to deal
with their unfinished business

16:21.272 --> 16:22.887
without anyone getting in their way.

16:23.024 --> 16:24.889
Yeah, but a lot of the people down here

16:25.026 --> 16:27.608
don't even know
what their unfinished business is.

16:27.737 --> 16:30.524
But, maybe,
as the Author I can tell them.

16:35.745 --> 16:36.860
What are they doing here?

16:36.913 --> 16:38.073
Hello to you, too.

16:38.206 --> 16:39.616
Are you just going to stand there,

16:39.749 --> 16:41.740
or are you going to let our
darling daughter see her mummy?

16:41.834 --> 16:42.869
Regina.

16:42.919 --> 16:44.329
It's okay, Robin.

16:44.420 --> 16:47.287
As hard as this is to believe,

16:47.423 --> 16:48.708
they're actually helping us.

16:49.091 --> 16:50.217
(BABY COOS)

16:50.593 --> 16:52.458
We both want the same thing.

16:52.595 --> 16:53.584
To leave this place.

16:53.638 --> 16:56.004
It's true. He took our names
off the tombstones. We can leave.

16:56.098 --> 16:57.804
Well, then what are we still doing here?

16:58.768 --> 17:00.099
Boy Scout's got a point.

17:00.144 --> 17:01.930
We could take the baby
to the cemetery now

17:01.979 --> 17:03.810
and then all walk through
as soon as it opens.

17:03.940 --> 17:05.976
Not without Emma and Hook.

17:06.108 --> 17:07.564
And Henry's right.

17:07.610 --> 17:09.100
We can still help people.

17:10.446 --> 17:12.061
Robin, take the baby to the portal.

17:12.114 --> 17:14.776
No. I'm not leaving you in this place.

17:14.825 --> 17:17.111
He may be playing nice, but there's
still plenty of people down here

17:17.245 --> 17:18.451
that have a grudge against you.

17:18.496 --> 17:19.827
Okay, then give the baby to Zelena.

17:19.956 --> 17:21.287
Are you mad?

17:28.130 --> 17:29.290
We can trust her.

17:30.967 --> 17:32.173
Maybe you can.

17:33.803 --> 17:35.293
Trust me.

to keep them here?

39:53.808 --> 39:58.427
Filled with water
from the River of Souls.

40:00.315 --> 40:01.350
No.

40:02.650 --> 40:04.151
VVhy?

40:04.193 --> 40:06.855
Villains don't get happy endings, Papa.

40:07.697 --> 40:11.656
And I'm here to make sure
you never get yours.

40:16.748 --> 40:17.783
(GROANING)

40:28.384 --> 40:30.841
Goodbye, Papa.

40:30.929 --> 40:32.339
For good this time.

41:21.229 --> 41:24.096
The portal. It's closing! Henry, hurry!

41:24.691 --> 41:25.680
Go!

41:28.569 --> 41:29.729
DAVID: Emma.

41:32.407 --> 41:34.272
I'm sorry there wasn't some other way.

41:36.953 --> 41:39.865
When I bought this jacket,
it was meant to be armor.

41:40.832 --> 41:43.414
To protect me from getting hurt
bythosellove.

41:44.127 --> 41:45.492
But now it's just a reminder.

41:46.713 --> 41:48.795
That I have to protect those I love.

41:49.966 --> 41:51.376
That nothing's more important.

41:52.301 --> 41:53.632
You did your best for Hook.

41:55.972 --> 41:57.678
I don't know.

41:57.765 --> 41:59.141
Did I?

41:59.267 --> 42:00.256
(RUMBLING)

42:00.893 --> 42:02.724
All I know is that
I can't lose anyone else.

42:02.812 --> 42:05.269
Let's go. (SOBS)

42:18.536 --> 42:19.571
(TICKING STOPS)
