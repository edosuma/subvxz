00:04.337 --> 00:06.573
- There's four guys now
to you six women,

00:06.639 --> 00:08.808
and it's like
backing a dog into the corner.

00:08.875 --> 00:10.043
It's not gonna be pretty.

00:17.050 --> 00:19.252

with Jason and Cam.

00:19.319 --> 00:21.121
They're trying to get us three
into the finale.

00:21.187 --> 00:23.723
- Somebody's gonna get a
toothpick to the neck today.

00:23.790 --> 00:26.459
- We have some shit we've
got to get out in the open.

00:26.526 --> 00:27.694
- About what?

00:27.761 --> 00:29.562
- [scoffs] Alliances?
- We get along.

00:29.629 --> 00:31.064
That's it.
But at the end of the day,

00:31.131 --> 00:33.266
I want to see
women at the finale.

00:33.333 --> 00:34.501
- I could give a shit less
about

00:34.567 --> 00:35.869
what you guys
like each other or not.

00:35.935 --> 00:36.870
I just don't like the word
being thrown around.

00:36.936 --> 00:38.238
- Agreed.

00:38.304 --> 00:40.573
<i>announcer: In the</i>

00:42.876 --> 00:44.477

00:44.544 --> 00:45.478

00:45.545 --> 00:46.846
It didn't look unfinished.

00:46.913 --> 00:48.448
I'm gonna vomit.

<i>announcer: In the elimination,</i>

00:51.818 --> 00:53.820
<i>were the bottom three artists.</i>

00:53.887 --> 00:55.255
- Jason.

00:55.321 --> 00:57.157
- The axe disappears
behind the top of the helmet.

00:57.223 --> 00:58.825
It just gets
a little bit confusing.

00:58.892 --> 01:00.326
- Alexis.

01:00.393 --> 01:02.295
- The mallet is not
interacting with the crab.

01:02.362 --> 01:04.164
That's the composition flaw.

01:04.230 --> 01:05.632
- Ash.
- Flags are tough.

01:05.698 --> 01:07.934
The top triangle looks
like you covered something.

01:08.001 --> 01:11.271
Ash, you do not have
what it takes to be Ink Master.

have nine lives.

02:31.251 --> 02:32.552

a player, like,

02:34.621 --> 02:36.589
we won tattoo of the day
two weeks in a row.

02:36.656 --> 02:38.057

They're cocky as [bleep].

03:50.964 --> 03:52.765

03:52.832 --> 03:54.334
Adaptability
is really important,

03:54.400 --> 03:56.970
because sometimes you don't get
to do what you're good at.

03:57.036 --> 03:58.338
<i>Sometimes you have to</i>
<i>do things</i>

03:58.404 --> 04:00.707
{\an8}that are out of

you must be able to tattoo

04:02.875 --> 04:04.711
anything that is thrown at you,

04:04.777 --> 04:06.879
no matter who designs it.

- Ooh.

04:09.782 --> 04:12.719

design for the women.

04:12.785 --> 04:14.721
- [laughs] shit.

04:14.787 --> 04:17.724
- And the women will
design for the men.

04:17.790 --> 04:19.726
{\an8}- These girls are gonna
be ruthless with us.

04:19.791 --> 04:22.161
- Each of you must create a
line drawing.

04:22.228 --> 04:25.031
Each artist will
then choose a line drawing

04:25.098 --> 04:27.734
designed by the opposite sex
to tattoo.

04:27.800 --> 04:29.035
- Oh, damn.

04:29.102 --> 04:31.437
- There is no limit
to the number of times

04:31.504 --> 04:32.739
a design can be chosen.

04:32.805 --> 04:33.740
- Oh.

04:33.806 --> 04:35.541
- Strategy is crucial,

04:35.608 --> 04:36.876
because this is your chance

04:36.943 --> 04:38.745
to take out
a member of the opposite sex.

04:38.811 --> 04:41.748
- This is gonna be interesting.

04:41.814 --> 04:45.685
- You have to use that line
drawing as your stencil.

04:45.752 --> 04:47.220
We are gonna judge these final
tattoos

04:47.286 --> 04:48.955
on the person who
tattooed them.

04:49.022 --> 04:51.257
We're also going to
judge the design

04:51.324 --> 04:53.760
on the person
that did the design.

04:53.826 --> 04:54.761
- Okay.

04:54.827 --> 04:56.062
- Push harder. Push further.

04:56.129 --> 04:58.031
Do a drawing that you would
love to wear,

04:58.097 --> 04:59.766
and then hand
that off today.

04:59.832 --> 05:01.034
- Got it.

05:01.100 --> 05:02.635
- Head to your shops
and start designing,

05:02.702 --> 05:04.203
and after you've
swapped your line drawings,

05:04.270 --> 05:08.775
we'll send in your canvases.
Good luck.

05:08.841 --> 05:10.209
- Get it, man.

05:10.276 --> 05:12.345
{\an8}- Today is gonna test
our artists' adaptability,

05:12.412 --> 05:13.446

05:15.448 --> 05:17.116

<i>all over the world,</i>

05:17.183 --> 05:20.286
and that is take any design and
turn it into your own design.

05:20.353 --> 05:23.389
- I don't know what I'm doing.
- I have ideas, at least.

05:23.456 --> 05:24.390
- All right, so let's think
about

05:24.457 --> 05:25.692
who does what on each team.

05:25.758 --> 05:26.993
We have to figure out what is
going to be

05:27.060 --> 05:29.562
the most difficult thing
for someone to tattoo.

05:29.629 --> 05:30.563
- It doesn't necessarily mean
they're gonna take it, though,

05:30.630 --> 05:31.864
that's the thing.

05:31.931 --> 05:33.332
- Everything needs to be
difficult in its own way,

05:33.399 --> 05:35.034
up to that part of, like, they
don't want to

05:35.101 --> 05:37.070
[bleep] take it,
but also, it's dope.

05:37.136 --> 05:39.072
<i>- I have a feeling</i>
<i>that the guys</i>

05:39.138 --> 05:40.640
<i>are gonna try</i>
<i>and trip us up,</i>

05:40.707 --> 05:44.077
{\an8}and I'm absolutely planning
on trying to trip the guys up.

05:44.143 --> 05:45.778
{\an1}I'm worried nobody's gonna
choose this,

05:45.845 --> 05:47.680
which I think is
gonna count against me.

05:47.747 --> 05:48.748
You've got to remember
the judges

05:48.815 --> 05:50.316
are gonna judge you on this.

05:50.383 --> 05:51.884
They're gonna judge you
on your drawing.

05:51.951 --> 05:54.153
You can trip someone up
with a line drawing

05:54.220 --> 05:57.190
<i>basically by either having</i>
<i>too much information in it</i>

05:57.256 --> 05:59.826
or leaving a lot of information
out of it.

05:59.892 --> 06:02.829
{\an3}- Holli, what do you
think of this?

06:02.895 --> 06:04.464
- I think that that's going to
trip somebody up,

06:04.530 --> 06:06.833
because they're not gonna know
how to shade the hair.

06:06.899 --> 06:08.735
{\an8}- Yeah. I am designing
sort of a witch,

06:08.801 --> 06:11.104
{\an8}and her hair is
turning into, like,

06:11.170 --> 06:13.005
this spacey smoke magic.

06:13.072 --> 06:15.308
I'm trying to do as many
difficult elements as possible

06:15.374 --> 06:17.410
in one tattoo
to really throw somebody.

06:18.945 --> 06:22.482
- All right, artists, your
design time is over.

06:22.548 --> 06:23.850
Swap line drawings.

06:23.916 --> 06:25.852
- Hi, guys.

06:25.918 --> 06:27.453
- Oh, finally.
- What do you got?

06:27.520 --> 06:28.855
Let me see. Let me see.
Let me see.

06:28.921 --> 06:30.089
- There you go. We got--

06:30.156 --> 06:33.860
- A heart with a dagger
and some flowers.

06:33.926 --> 06:35.128
- I did a little spider.

06:35.194 --> 06:37.864
- Oh, I love it.
I want to do the spider now.

06:37.930 --> 06:38.865
- Can I see your robot?

06:38.931 --> 06:41.868
- He's like a happy one.

06:41.934 --> 06:42.902
- These are both
cool as [bleep].

06:42.969 --> 06:44.170
- I got hype
on your sandwich.

06:44.237 --> 06:45.872
- It's so much fun.
- That's so awesome.

06:45.938 --> 06:47.874
- It's Cam with a mustache,
cool.

06:47.940 --> 06:51.878
- You drew a picture of me.
I'm flattered.

06:51.944 --> 06:52.879
{\an3}- So I'm gonna tell you right
now, I'm not doing this.

06:52.945 --> 06:54.180
- That's fine.

06:54.247 --> 06:55.882
{\an1}- I was hoping I could get
you stoked on this one.

06:55.948 --> 06:59.719
- Okay. I'm gonna make your
dragon into a dwarf dragon.

06:59.786 --> 07:00.953
{\an1}- Thanks.

07:01.020 --> 07:02.588
- I don't know why
he gave them these.

07:02.655 --> 07:06.159
{\an3}Like, what the [bleep] is that?
They don't have those.

07:06.225 --> 07:07.894
{\an1}- I'm between sandwich
and robot.

07:07.960 --> 07:09.061
- I really want to
do the sandwich.

07:09.128 --> 07:10.696
- But then they're gonna
compare ours.

07:10.763 --> 07:12.899
I've never done a robot,
so I don't know how to do it.

07:12.965 --> 07:15.535
- I think I could pay this
tattoo some respect.

07:15.601 --> 07:16.903
{\an3}Definitely gonna take
Laura's tattoo.

07:16.969 --> 07:18.237
- I think that's a good choice.

07:18.304 --> 07:20.907
- Just hope you don't get
yourself in a pickle.

07:20.973 --> 07:23.910
- They gave us some
pretty stupid designs.

07:23.976 --> 07:25.311
- There's a wizard,
and there's a spider,

07:25.378 --> 07:27.947
and then there's an
American traditional horse,

07:28.014 --> 07:29.916
and then there's the dragon.

07:29.982 --> 07:31.117
- Do what's calling to you.

07:31.184 --> 07:32.618
- Yeah, I don't know.
All of them suck.

07:32.685 --> 07:34.887
None of them are
calling to me.

07:36.989 --> 07:38.925
- I hope you like
birthday robots.

07:38.991 --> 07:40.092
{\an1}- Oh, wow.

07:40.159 --> 07:41.394
- Doing a cute little
tarantula today.

07:41.460 --> 07:42.929
How precious is he?

07:42.995 --> 07:44.230
- It's adorable.

07:44.297 --> 07:45.965
- Here we are with a sandwich.

07:46.032 --> 07:47.366
{\an3}- Hey, I'm a culinary student,
so a sandwich is great.

07:47.433 --> 07:49.902
- Oh, see, it's like destiny,
bro. That's crazy.

07:49.969 --> 07:51.070
- Hey, can I pick your brain?

07:51.137 --> 07:52.305
- I shouldn't even
be helping you.

07:52.371 --> 07:53.606
{\an1}- I know, but you want me
to do a cool tattoo,

07:53.673 --> 07:54.874
I mean, I'm trying to do you--
- Yes, I do.

07:54.941 --> 07:55.942
{\an3}I want you to do
justice to my little robot.

07:56.008 --> 07:57.777
- And that's my goal here.

07:57.844 --> 08:00.246
I'm, like, debating, like,
doing the trim, like these,

08:00.313 --> 08:02.014
{\an1}and like the joints
and the eyes

08:02.081 --> 08:03.950
{\an1}all in a different
tone metal.

08:04.016 --> 08:04.951
- You could also do rust.

08:05.017 --> 08:06.652
- Oh, man, that's a cool idea.

08:06.719 --> 08:08.454
<i>Instantly, I know what</i>
<i>this thing looks like.</i>

08:08.521 --> 08:09.922
{\an8}I'm not surprised at all

{\an8}<i>is willing to help me out.</i>

08:11.357 --> 08:12.959
{\an8}We both have a lot of respect
for each other.

08:13.025 --> 08:14.227
- You doing my dragon?

08:14.293 --> 08:15.962
- I'm gonna make it
a little bit bigger.

08:16.028 --> 08:16.963
{\an1}- She doesn't just
need to make it bigger.

08:17.029 --> 08:18.130
She's got to fix it.

08:18.197 --> 08:19.966
- What don't you like
about my dragon?

08:20.032 --> 08:20.967
{\an3}- There's a few,
uh, inconsistencies.

08:21.033 --> 08:22.301
- Where?

08:22.368 --> 08:23.970
- The scales.
Get rid of these, too. Those.

08:24.036 --> 08:24.971

24:12.017 --> 24:13.819
Time is up.
No more ink.

24:13.885 --> 24:15.020
- That's it for today.

24:15.086 --> 24:16.822
- Hell yeah.
The colors are awesome.

24:16.888 --> 24:18.089
- That's something to pull off.

24:18.156 --> 24:19.825
I don't know
how you pulled it off.

24:19.891 --> 24:20.826
{\an1}- Magic.

24:20.892 --> 24:21.827
- Your sweet, sweet sandwich.

24:21.893 --> 24:22.828
- You did a really good job.

24:22.894 --> 24:24.129
- Cool, thank you.

24:24.196 --> 24:25.697
- So how'd you do?
- Well, you were right.

24:25.764 --> 24:28.466
I couldn't do the scales that
size, so I did 'em smaller.

24:28.533 --> 24:29.634
- Oh, you did?
- Yes.

24:29.701 --> 24:31.837
Smaller than you did 'em.

24:31.903 --> 24:33.471
{\an1}- I've never seen you do, like,
illustrative Japanese stuff.

24:33.538 --> 24:35.974
- I have never done a black and
grey dragon in my entire life.

24:36.041 --> 24:37.375
I honestly only did that

24:37.442 --> 24:38.410
because I knew
that you would take it.

24:38.476 --> 24:40.045
{\an3}But you did, like,
the opposite

24:40.111 --> 24:41.546
{\an3}of what I wanted
you to do with it.

24:41.613 --> 24:45.317
You simplified it and, like,
made it easier on yourself.

24:45.383 --> 24:46.618
- I don't think
freehanding scales

24:46.685 --> 24:48.854
is making it
easier on myself.

24:48.920 --> 24:49.855
- Yeah, I know.

24:49.921 --> 24:50.856
- How is that easy?

24:50.922 --> 24:52.023
- I didn't say it was easy.

24:52.090 --> 24:53.859
- You literally just
said it was easy.

24:53.925 --> 24:55.293
- I said you
made it easier on yourself.

24:55.360 --> 24:56.862
But like, why would you--
- That's essentially what--

24:56.928 --> 25:00.866
- You can call it
whatever you want.

25:00.932 --> 25:01.967
- At some point you're gonna
have to hit back,

25:02.033 --> 25:03.101
and you've got to hit soon.

25:03.168 --> 25:04.836

- How she would've done it.
- Yeah, extremely.

25:30.295 --> 25:31.429

"Well,

25:31.496 --> 25:32.364

the rust stuff?"

25:32.430 --> 25:33.531

That's a [bleep] great idea,

25:41.206 --> 25:43.375
from someone on what to
do in a tattoo?

25:43.441 --> 25:44.509
- I guess I was thinking
about, like,

25:44.576 --> 25:45.977
if you're in a street shop,

25:46.044 --> 25:47.846

"How do you do this?"

25:50.348 --> 25:51.149
- I worked at a street shop
my whole career.

25:51.216 --> 25:52.450
- Me too.

25:52.517 --> 25:53.518
- My career spans a lot longer
than yours.

25:53.585 --> 25:55.020
I know what a real
street--

25:55.086 --> 25:56.454
- That doesn't mean shit.
We're still in the same boat.

25:56.521 --> 25:57.923
- It does mean shit,
because street shops today

25:57.989 --> 25:59.391
aren't the same as street shops
18 years ago.

25:59.457 --> 26:00.592
- That's-- yeah.

26:00.659 --> 26:01.927
- I've lived it.
I know the difference.

26:01.993 --> 26:03.128
- Okay, great. Good for you.

26:03.194 --> 26:04.396
But I experienced mine.

26:04.462 --> 26:05.897
- But don't discredit
my opinion

26:05.964 --> 26:07.399
just because your
opinion's different.

26:07.465 --> 26:09.367

26:09.434 --> 26:10.669

Every time one of the guys says
something,

26:11.803 --> 26:13.338

26:20.478 --> 26:22.414

was [bleep] shit.

26:22.480 --> 26:24.416
- You're literally making
up bullshit, Janelle.

26:24.482 --> 26:26.051
- You think
my design was shit

26:26.117 --> 26:27.419
because you couldn't
execute it right.

26:27.485 --> 26:28.687
- No, I just didn't like it.

26:28.753 --> 26:30.422
- So then why the [bleep]
did you choose it?

26:30.488 --> 26:32.424
- Because I knew
I could change it.

27:17.535 --> 27:18.837
- Thank you, so much.

27:18.903 --> 27:20.472
- All right, Dani,
you tattooed Jake's design.

27:20.538 --> 27:22.807
- Very simple color palette,
nothing real dynamic,

27:22.874 --> 27:24.075
but I think the way you did it

27:49.367 --> 27:52.504
Let's have a look at
the tattoo that you drew.

27:52.570 --> 27:54.072
- It's not a challenging
tattoo.

27:54.139 --> 27:55.340
That's not
a strong enough design

27:55.407 --> 27:57.509
for you to stand up here

27:57.575 --> 27:58.877

27:58.943 --> 28:01.079
I would expect you to have
a really solid plan

28:01.146 --> 28:02.847
on how to
make this thing super legible,

28:02.914 --> 28:05.050
but the color tones you chose
are very alike.

28:05.116 --> 28:06.451
It just gets muddy, man.

28:06.518 --> 28:07.585
- She did something
very similar

28:07.652 --> 28:08.520
to what I would have
approached,

28:08.586 --> 28:09.954
and so I said [bleep] it

28:10.021 --> 28:11.523
and tried to do something
completely different.

28:11.589 --> 28:12.924
{\an8}- Dani's is definitely
more legible.

28:12.991 --> 28:15.794
{\an8}Leaving the web open
left a little bit more room

28:15.860 --> 28:17.462
{\an8}to see the spots
between each leg.

28:17.529 --> 28:18.763
- I agree.

28:18.830 --> 28:21.533
- Moving on,
you tattooed Alexis's design.

28:21.599 --> 28:24.369
- Pretty funny tattoo, pretty
peculiar design to choose.

28:24.436 --> 28:26.371
Everything in the tattoo is
very legible,

28:26.438 --> 28:28.540
a lot of open skin.
It's very breathable.

28:28.606 --> 28:31.910
- But there's a lot of grey
undertone over pastel colors.

28:31.976 --> 28:34.279
Let certain things be really
bright and vibrant.

28:34.345 --> 28:35.680
You're, like, muffling it.

28:35.747 --> 28:37.215
You're putting a screaming head
under a pillow.

28:37.282 --> 28:38.750
Let it scream.

28:38.817 --> 28:40.085
You know,
you can't stand and fight

28:40.151 --> 28:41.486
like this the whole time,
because

28:41.553 --> 28:42.987
you're not gonna be able

28:43.054 --> 28:44.055
At some point you're
gonna have to hit back,

28:44.122 --> 28:47.425
and you've got to hit soon.

28:47.492 --> 28:49.561
- It was a good sandwich.
Shit looked delicious.

28:49.627 --> 28:52.564
- Alexis.

28:52.630 --> 28:54.132
- The black you put in this
tattoo

28:54.199 --> 28:56.067
really pushes the color
forward and bright,

28:56.134 --> 28:58.169
but, man, that bread is black.

28:58.236 --> 29:00.071
- It does look a little burnt.

29:00.138 --> 29:02.040
And what's doing that for me
is the front,

29:02.107 --> 29:03.575
where you have
that darkness.

29:03.641 --> 29:05.577
- Why would that be black,
the inside of the bread?

29:05.643 --> 29:08.580
- It's just a strong,
strong light source.

29:08.646 --> 29:10.014
- We push for people to put
more black,

29:10.081 --> 29:11.382
{\an8}but you put too much.

29:11.449 --> 29:13.585
{\an8}I like the more open skin
in Jake's.

29:13.651 --> 29:15.086
{\an8}- I like Alexis's color,

29:15.153 --> 29:18.590
{\an8}and I love the fact
that you drew a sandwich.

29:18.656 --> 29:19.791
- Thank you.

29:19.858 --> 29:21.593
- Let's move on
to Jason's line drawing.

29:21.659 --> 29:23.094
- It gets kind of muddy
in the face,

29:23.161 --> 29:24.896
and in the top of the
broccoli itself.

29:24.963 --> 29:27.365
If you could've lightened up
a little bit in the florets

29:27.432 --> 29:29.200
and brought more life to them.

29:29.267 --> 29:30.835
I love the fact that
you're pushing yourself

29:30.902 --> 29:32.370
to do challenging designs.

29:32.437 --> 29:34.405
Just a little bit of
the application gets away.

29:39.444 --> 29:40.478
- Jason.

29:42.680 --> 29:44.115
- We really like this drawing.

29:44.182 --> 29:45.617
It's really creative,
different reach.

29:45.683 --> 29:48.353
Your application on this
is super slick, man.

29:48.419 --> 29:50.722
These smooth, multi-tones of
different green

29:50.788 --> 29:52.624
that kind of blend together
with the open skin

29:52.690 --> 29:54.626
make each one of these stalks
come to life.

29:54.692 --> 29:56.394
- More than anything,
it is crisp and clean.

29:56.461 --> 29:58.796
That solid approach
with letting things breathe

29:58.863 --> 30:01.633
in this competition,
it's what's gonna win.

30:01.699 --> 30:05.236
- Moving on. Jason,
you tattooed Laura's design.

30:05.303 --> 30:07.238
You do a great tattoo here.

30:07.305 --> 30:09.107
And to take it from that
weathered look,

30:09.174 --> 30:11.543
and then go into the clean hat,

30:11.609 --> 30:14.612
which clearly has not
been with it its entire life

30:14.679 --> 30:16.648
is a nice touch of detail.

30:16.714 --> 30:18.349
- Again, you hit it out of the
park in your execution.

30:18.416 --> 30:19.651
You're competing.

30:19.717 --> 30:23.655
- Thanks, guys. Pow.

30:23.721 --> 30:26.658
- Laura.

30:26.724 --> 30:28.259
- This thing is the best.

30:28.326 --> 30:30.428
The style and execution that
you have here,

30:30.495 --> 30:33.498
and the way that you understand
how to capture chrome is great.

30:33.565 --> 30:36.467
What I get excited about is
real soul,

30:36.534 --> 30:38.937
and real coolness
to tattooing.

30:39.003 --> 30:40.672
The thing looks amazing.

30:40.738 --> 30:41.973
- If you choose Creepy Jason,

30:42.040 --> 30:43.575
{\an8}you will not hurt my feelings
whatsoever.

30:43.641 --> 30:44.609
{\an8}- Thank God, I don't have to
choose.

30:44.676 --> 30:46.177
{\an8}So they both win.

30:46.244 --> 30:47.812
- Wow.

30:47.879 --> 30:50.982
- You chose Cam's line drawing.
You changed the line drawing?

30:51.049 --> 30:52.750
- The scales, just to kind of

30:52.817 --> 30:54.519
keep the integrity
of the tattoo

30:54.586 --> 30:55.687
so it would age better.

30:55.753 --> 30:57.288
- It's a great change.

30:57.355 --> 30:59.691
That's what traditional dragon
scales look like.

30:59.757 --> 31:02.093
- But there's a lot of anatomy
on this that's strange.

31:02.160 --> 31:04.829
The horn on the left side
is incredibly huge.

31:04.896 --> 31:07.165
It throws the rhythm of
the dragon off a little bit.

31:07.232 --> 31:08.466
It's tough.

31:08.533 --> 31:09.701
- Man, I thought they
were gonna like it.

31:09.767 --> 31:12.704
- Cam.

31:12.770 --> 31:14.872
- You tattoo it in a way that
makes a lot more sense,

31:14.939 --> 31:17.008
because you understand what it
is that you're doing.

31:17.075 --> 31:19.711
I like the way the belly scales
look on that.

31:19.777 --> 31:20.845
- Laura's,
with the way it's colored,

31:20.912 --> 31:22.780
{\an8}does make some
anatomical things

31:22.847 --> 31:24.048
{\an8}kind of stand out
a little stronger.

31:24.115 --> 31:26.517
{\an8}- Cam's understanding of
what it is that he drew,

31:26.584 --> 31:30.088
he was able to shine with his
own work a little bit brighter.

31:30.154 --> 31:31.189
- Thank you.

31:33.224 --> 31:35.727
- Next up, Cam, you tattooed
Janelle's design.

31:35.793 --> 31:38.630
- Your ability to use different
tones in black and grey

31:38.696 --> 31:40.398
makes it look really strong.

31:40.465 --> 31:42.734
Nothing gets muddied or lost
in this design.

31:42.800 --> 31:43.735
- You are shining.

31:43.801 --> 31:45.737
- Thank you.

31:45.803 --> 31:48.740
- Janelle.

31:48.806 --> 31:50.275
- Both tattoos that got done

31:50.341 --> 31:51.843
with this line drawing came
out really slick.

31:51.909 --> 31:54.612
Your line work in this tattoo
is also very clean.

31:54.679 --> 31:57.282
The thing about your tattoo is,
it's really dark.

31:57.348 --> 31:59.684
You got dark in the gold,
you got dark in the heart,

31:59.751 --> 32:01.552
you got dark in the flower,
dark in the leaves,

32:01.619 --> 32:03.655
so it does get a little bit
harder to read,

32:03.721 --> 32:06.691
when I feel like this tattoo
should be shining bright.

32:06.758 --> 32:07.892
- Cam edges this one out

32:07.959 --> 32:10.061
{\an8}just based on
the play between objects.

32:10.128 --> 32:12.764
{\an8}Everything kind of
separates and stands out.

32:12.830 --> 32:15.767
- Moving on. Janelle,
you tattooed Pon's design.

32:15.833 --> 32:17.902
- Some of the same things are
wrong with this tattoo,

32:17.969 --> 32:19.070
dark and dark and dark.

32:19.137 --> 32:21.039
And I do see
fuzziness around them.

32:21.105 --> 32:23.775
This guy's skin
wasn't taking it as well.

32:23.841 --> 32:25.376
- This is not what I want to do

32:25.443 --> 32:26.778
and want to present to you
guys.

32:26.844 --> 32:29.347
- We know you can do it.
On this person's skin.

32:29.414 --> 32:30.581
We need to know you can do it

32:30.648 --> 32:32.650
no matter what skin
walks in the door.

32:37.188 --> 32:41.793
- Holli. You also chose
Pon's design.

32:41.859 --> 32:44.028
- The eye's going up,
like this weird shape,

32:44.095 --> 32:46.798
and it's throwing the whole
back side of the head off.

32:46.864 --> 32:48.132
- The way you shaded
around the eye,

32:48.199 --> 32:50.802
it pushes the eye
into an awkward place.

32:50.868 --> 32:52.804
- There's a very weird
look to this.

32:52.870 --> 32:55.807
- Let's move to the tattoo
that you designed.

32:55.873 --> 32:57.875
- The black shading you have
in the shorts,

32:57.942 --> 32:59.377
the shading in the back
side of the banners,

32:59.444 --> 33:02.580
it's a rich, solid black,
very smooth pepper fade-out.

33:02.647 --> 33:04.649
It's a complex tattoo
with a lot of stuff,

33:04.716 --> 33:06.818
but you make it look
super simple, super clean.

33:06.884 --> 33:08.086
- The one thing that's glaring

33:08.152 --> 33:09.721
is that red spot behind his
head.

33:09.787 --> 33:14.625
It's not circular.
That got away a little bit.

33:14.692 --> 33:17.829
Pon.

33:17.895 --> 33:21.833
You selected Holli's
line drawing. So clean.

33:21.899 --> 33:23.634
- Your application here is
great,

33:23.701 --> 33:25.803
and I love the colors
that you're reaching for.

33:25.870 --> 33:28.840
The yellow stars against the
turquoise, they stand bright.

33:28.906 --> 33:31.409
- It's a really bold,
standout tattoo.

33:31.476 --> 33:33.044
- Both you guys really
did a nice job

33:33.111 --> 33:34.846
{\an8}on those tattoos
on the figures.

33:34.912 --> 33:37.382
{\an8}- It's like traditional versus
neo-traditional.

33:37.448 --> 33:40.118
{\an8}Holli's is slick, and Pon's
is straightforward.

33:40.184 --> 33:41.285
- They're both great.

33:41.352 --> 33:43.855
Let's move along
to Pon's line drawing.

33:43.921 --> 33:46.891
- There's a much better balance
and understanding here

33:46.958 --> 33:48.860
of how you're playing
with your color.

33:48.926 --> 33:50.695
- Adding a little bit of
robin's egg blue

33:50.762 --> 33:52.797
and light pink
makes this tattoo stronger,

33:52.864 --> 33:53.865
makes it more visible.

33:53.931 --> 33:55.433
And the way you shaded
the horse

33:55.500 --> 33:58.336
makes it not look like
a goofy horse.

33:58.403 --> 34:00.872
{\an8}- We had two other outings
today on this design.

34:00.938 --> 34:03.508
{\an8}- Pon's stands the strongest,
and it's the simplest,

34:03.574 --> 34:05.176
{\an8}and it has the most power
and the most impact.

34:05.243 --> 34:07.412
- Thank you.

34:07.478 --> 34:09.313
Whew.

34:11.382 --> 34:12.449
- All right, guys,
we have to determine

34:12.516 --> 34:14.886
who had the best tattoos
of the day.

34:14.952 --> 34:17.088
- Jason immediately
has two standout tattoos.

34:17.155 --> 34:18.956
He drew for himself,
and he picked something

34:19.023 --> 34:21.826
just like what he would draw.
He found his lane.

34:21.893 --> 34:25.897
Pon also found his lane today.
Your tattoos stand bright.

34:25.963 --> 34:27.899
- Ollie, final decision.

34:27.965 --> 34:29.900
- My vote's for Jason.
- Jason for the win.

34:29.967 --> 34:32.570
- The judges have decided
the best tattoos of the day

34:32.637 --> 34:33.905
go to Jason.

34:33.971 --> 34:36.908
- Thank you, guys.
And thank you, Laura.

34:36.974 --> 34:39.444
- For the rest of you,
based on both of your tattoos,

34:39.510 --> 34:41.112
one of you will be eliminated.

34:41.179 --> 34:43.380
Head back to the loft,
and we'll call you back

34:43.447 --> 34:45.016
when we have a decision.

34:50.987 --> 34:52.389
- I'm kind of pumped
that I was able to do a dragon

34:52.456 --> 34:53.925
and not get totally
ripped apart for it.

34:53.991 --> 34:56.159
- I like my design,
and I like how I did it.

34:56.226 --> 34:57.195
- Yeah, and apparently
you didn't

34:57.261 --> 34:58.930
do a very [bleep] good job.

34:58.996 --> 35:00.531
- When I gave you a critique on
yours

35:00.598 --> 35:02.366
about how I thought yours
was very flat with the colors,

35:02.433 --> 35:03.668
you got mad at me,

35:03.734 --> 35:05.136
and the judges said
the exact same thing.

35:05.203 --> 35:07.472
- I got mad at you when you
discredited my journey,

35:07.538 --> 35:08.940
because you went personal
with things.

35:09.006 --> 35:10.942
- You don't think calling
my design shitty was personal?

35:11.008 --> 35:11.943
- I just said that I didn't
like the design,

35:12.009 --> 35:13.110
so I changed it.

35:13.177 --> 35:14.078
- No, you said it was
a shitty design.

35:14.145 --> 35:15.947
- Yeah, so I changed it.

35:16.013 --> 35:17.949
- That's not personal to you?
Calling my design shitty?

35:18.015 --> 35:19.283
- I didn't say anything about,
like,

35:19.350 --> 35:20.718
how you became
a tattoo artist, or--

35:20.785 --> 35:21.886
- I didn't say anything about

35:21.953 --> 35:23.321
how you became
a tattooer either.

35:23.387 --> 35:25.623
- It's [bleep] hard to go
through what I went through.

35:25.690 --> 35:27.225
I worked in a street shop,

35:27.291 --> 35:31.229
I worked in [bleep] the worst
place you can [bleep] think of

35:31.295 --> 35:32.830
that didn't want me
to work there,

35:32.897 --> 35:35.266
and you discredit me,
immediately.

35:35.333 --> 35:37.001
- I never discredited
your journey.

35:42.039 --> 35:44.475
- A lot of the guys here will
admit that,

35:44.542 --> 35:45.877
yes, it's hard for women.

35:45.943 --> 35:48.679
But, like, they don't get it.
They don't get it.

35:48.746 --> 35:50.081
Pon's saying
that he's been tattooing

35:50.147 --> 35:52.483
as long as me, 18 years.

35:52.550 --> 35:54.418
And 18 years ago,
it was a bad scene.

35:54.485 --> 35:55.686
It's really [bleep]ed up

35:55.753 --> 35:57.655
that it's
this many years later,

35:57.722 --> 36:00.992
and that your apprenticeship
was the same.

36:01.058 --> 36:03.394
- It took me so many years
to actually

36:03.461 --> 36:05.196
just get my foot in the door.

36:05.263 --> 36:08.699
And all through those years,
I've had threats, you know?

36:08.766 --> 36:11.002
- I do. I do.

36:11.068 --> 36:13.004
- So, it's just like
they don't understand.

36:13.070 --> 36:15.373
- They don't understand.

36:15.439 --> 36:19.043
You represent us as, like,
a voice.

36:19.110 --> 36:20.645
Don't ever stop.

36:20.711 --> 36:22.813
- If anything,
I'm definitely gonna say more.

36:28.219 --> 36:30.955
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

36:31.022 --> 36:33.457
<i>♪ ♪</i>

36:33.524 --> 36:35.226
- Today, we're testing
adaptability,

36:35.293 --> 36:37.662
and all the artists did not
one, but two tattoos.

36:37.728 --> 36:39.697
- In my vote, Alexis
loses both tattoos.

36:39.764 --> 36:41.198
- The broccoli?

36:41.265 --> 36:43.467
There's not a line on there
that's a solid black line.

36:43.534 --> 36:46.270
- Alexis did better with her
own line drawing.

36:46.337 --> 36:49.473
However, an artist that
didn't have that luck was Jake.

36:49.540 --> 36:50.808
- There's not a solid attempt
here

36:50.875 --> 36:52.243
at really drawing something and
being, like,

36:52.310 --> 36:53.477
"I'm representing myself."

36:53.544 --> 36:55.479
He didn't come to play
like that.

36:55.546 --> 36:57.481
- Let's look at Janelle.

36:57.548 --> 36:59.717
- It's just dark and hard to
read both tattoos.

36:59.784 --> 37:01.485
It just gets real muddy.

37:01.552 --> 37:03.487
- So, guys, how do we decide
who's gonna go home?

37:03.554 --> 37:05.790
- I see this as we have to find
the law of averages

37:05.856 --> 37:07.491
and average out
the body of work.

37:07.558 --> 37:10.494
- I agree with that.
- Sure, let's dig into this.

37:10.561 --> 37:12.930
- One third of the room is
going to the bottom.

37:12.997 --> 37:14.398
- Everyone always had a buffer,

37:14.465 --> 37:16.100
because they knew someone was
gonna do worse than them.

37:16.167 --> 37:17.201
But if anything,
it's just gonna get

37:17.268 --> 37:18.302
more and more intense.

37:22.139 --> 37:23.441
- All right, guys.

37:23.507 --> 37:29.046
In the bottom, we've got
Janelle, Alexis, and Jake.

37:29.113 --> 37:32.450
We'll see you three, and
everybody else, downstairs.

37:32.516 --> 37:33.918
- I'll do what I've got to do.

37:33.985 --> 37:35.786
You know, whatever you've got
to do today is on you.

37:35.853 --> 37:37.188
- Yeah.

37:37.254 --> 37:38.322
- You know, at this point,
anyone that goes home

37:38.389 --> 37:40.891
is gonna be
a huge hit to the house.

37:40.958 --> 37:41.993
Let's do it.

37:51.602 --> 37:54.672
- This week, your adaptability
was put to the test.

37:54.739 --> 37:58.409
Based on your work, one of you
will be packing your machines.

38:00.611 --> 38:02.647
- Today, we're looking at the
law of averages,

38:02.713 --> 38:04.882
and who was the strongest
between their two tattoos.

38:04.949 --> 38:05.983
That's what
we're trying to decide,

38:06.050 --> 38:07.551
and make the fairest choice.

38:07.618 --> 38:08.953
- I'd just like to say,
time and time again,

38:09.020 --> 38:10.087
Jake has been
brought down here,

38:10.154 --> 38:11.422
I was down here with him once,

38:11.489 --> 38:12.857
but you've never been able
to fault him

38:12.923 --> 38:15.226
for technical application.

38:15.292 --> 38:17.561
- Do I think I did the worst
tattoos here? No.

38:17.628 --> 38:19.430
- You're the one guy in here
that I've seen,

38:19.497 --> 38:21.098
that I'm like, "Okay,
this week he's gonna get it."

38:21.165 --> 38:23.367
If you stay, you've got to
start taking chances

38:23.434 --> 38:25.569
and really make it loud.

38:25.636 --> 38:26.871
- Yeah. If we're going off,
like, technical stuff,

38:26.937 --> 38:28.239
I think Janelle
struggled the most.

38:28.305 --> 38:29.573
- With one tattoo.

38:29.640 --> 38:31.575
But I redeemed myself
with my own design.

38:31.642 --> 38:32.743
- If you look at both tattoos,

38:32.810 --> 38:34.412
your color palettes are very
close.

38:34.478 --> 38:36.614
You've just got to pull
back on your darks

38:36.681 --> 38:38.582
and make this thing
shine again.

38:38.649 --> 38:39.884
- That's right.

38:39.950 --> 38:41.485
- Alexis,
you got a lot of praise

38:41.552 --> 38:43.587
for the out of the box design.

38:43.654 --> 38:46.123
- I love my sandwich tattoo.
I don't-- I just--

38:46.190 --> 38:48.426
- For me, you're in the bottom
for application,

38:48.492 --> 38:51.195
not for drawing.

38:51.262 --> 38:56.600
- All right, guys, time to
determine who is going home.

38:56.667 --> 38:58.202
- We know for
technical application,

38:58.269 --> 38:59.336
Janelle's in the bottom.

38:59.403 --> 39:00.604
- Especially
with the horseshoe.

39:00.671 --> 39:02.807
- And if we look at
Alexis's broccoli,

39:02.873 --> 39:05.609
man, that's not
a smooth application.

39:05.676 --> 39:07.078
- So are you guys saying
that Jake's safe?

39:07.144 --> 39:10.614
- I'm good with that.

39:10.681 --> 39:12.450
- Me and you, kid.

39:12.516 --> 39:13.951
- I mean, I like Janelle's
heart.

39:14.018 --> 39:16.620
It's heavy shaded,
but it's clean.

39:16.687 --> 39:19.056
- Does Janelle's beat either
of Alexis's tattoos?

39:19.123 --> 39:21.726
- I do wish that the inside
of Jake's sandwich

39:21.792 --> 39:23.627
{\an8}looked like the inside
of Alexis's sandwich.

39:23.694 --> 39:26.130
{\an8}- The smoothness
of the darker tattoo,

39:26.197 --> 39:27.798
I'm drawn to that,
because I love black.

39:27.865 --> 39:30.634
So, saying less black is hard
to come out of my mouth.

39:30.701 --> 39:32.837
- But the way that Alexis
colored the bread,

39:32.903 --> 39:35.406
she wasn't thinking about
the fact that it's bread.

39:35.473 --> 39:37.641
Nunez is always going crazy
about light sources.

39:37.708 --> 39:39.310
The front of the bread is just
dark as night,

39:39.376 --> 39:41.078
and then the back of the bread
is also dark as night.

39:41.145 --> 39:42.580
There's no way.

39:42.646 --> 39:44.782
That edge of the bread,
where you cut open the bread,

39:44.849 --> 39:46.417
that should be
the open skin.

39:46.484 --> 39:48.652
- Touché, mi amigo, touché.

39:48.719 --> 39:50.387
- Alexis, I'm sorry.
My vote's for you.

39:53.924 --> 39:57.661
- Alexis.

39:57.728 --> 39:59.196
- The judges have decided.

39:59.263 --> 40:03.667
Alexis, you do not have what
it takes to be Ink Master.

40:03.734 --> 40:05.336
- It's a real hard decision
today,

40:05.402 --> 40:08.506
because your creativity deems a
space in the competition,

40:08.572 --> 40:09.640
and that's what I'm hoping

40:09.707 --> 40:11.308
people rise to
that stay behind.

40:11.375 --> 40:13.344
I really respect what you do,

40:13.410 --> 40:15.446
and we're sure we're gonna
see you again.

40:15.513 --> 40:16.781
- Sounds good.

40:16.847 --> 40:23.454
- Please pack your machines
and close shop.

40:23.521 --> 40:25.456
<i>- I've been tattooing</i>
<i>for so long.</i>

40:25.523 --> 40:28.125
I haven't pushed myself
in a really long time.

40:28.192 --> 40:30.828
The judges have shown me
I can draw,

40:30.895 --> 40:33.097
<i>and I will take that home</i>
<i>and I'm gonna make my tattoos</i>

40:33.164 --> 40:35.199
the most technical,
sound tattoos you've ever seen.

40:35.266 --> 40:38.602
And I'm not gonna stop
tattooing. Ever. Ever.

40:50.414 --> 40:53.150
<i>announcer: On the next</i>
<i>episode of "Ink Master"...</i>

40:53.217 --> 40:55.052
- I want three guys
in the bottom.

40:55.119 --> 40:56.220
- Go at his throat.

40:56.287 --> 40:57.154
- No one's gonna respect
you for that.

40:57.221 --> 40:58.622
Our team strategy right now?

40:58.689 --> 41:00.324
I don't agree with it.
Not at all.

41:00.391 --> 41:02.159
<i>I came here to do</i>
<i>good tattoos.</i>

41:02.226 --> 41:04.161
- How many times are you gonna
shoot yourself in the foot?

41:04.228 --> 41:06.163
- You have a tendency
to self-sabotage.

41:06.230 --> 41:07.298
- I feel bad for you right now,

41:07.364 --> 41:09.166
because no one has faith
in you.

41:09.233 --> 41:10.467
- Your tattoo is a bummer.

41:10.534 --> 41:12.169
- It's out of control.
This thing's a mess.

41:12.236 --> 41:13.838
- Everybody here [bleep]ed up.

41:13.904 --> 41:15.172
- 100%.

41:15.239 --> 41:16.740
- This thing looks
[bleep] jacked.
