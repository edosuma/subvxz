We're here today
seeking $200,000

16:52.245 --> 16:53.246
and your friendship

16:53.246 --> 16:56.482
for 7.5% of the greatest
company ever.

16:56.482 --> 16:58.317
Mm.
Now, Sharks,
what if I told you

16:58.317 --> 17:01.120
that our product could
instantly make you smarter...

17:01.120 --> 17:02.255
More attractive.

17:02.255 --> 17:05.391
Younger.
And even regrow hair?

17:05.391 --> 17:07.193
Well, guess what?

17:07.193 --> 17:08.561
It can't do any
of those things.

17:08.561 --> 17:11.264
[ Laughter ]
Sorry, Mr. Wonderful.

17:11.264 --> 17:13.199
There are just
some things in life

17:13.199 --> 17:14.700
that will never
get any better.

17:14.700 --> 17:17.536
But there are some things
in life that can get better,

17:17.536 --> 17:19.472
like pizza
when you pair it with...

17:19.472 --> 17:20.740
Pie Wine.
Pie Wine.

17:20.740 --> 17:24.577
Pie Wine is a sweet, sparkling,
easy-drinking canned table wine

17:24.577 --> 17:26.612
that goes great
with your favorite slice.

17:26.612 --> 17:31.083
That's why we say Pie Wine
is the OG pizza wine.
AKA...

17:31.083 --> 17:32.451
Pizza's new side piece.
AKA...

17:32.451 --> 17:35.655
It puts
the "ahh" in "pizza."
AKA...

17:35.655 --> 17:37.523
Dude, that's it.
We're out of slogans.

17:37.523 --> 17:40.493
We knew we had to reimagine
and reintroduce to the masses...
[ Laughter ]

17:40.493 --> 17:42.728
...what pizza-loving Italians
have known for generations --

17:42.728 --> 17:46.232
That pizza goes best with
a sweet, slightly bubbly wine,

17:46.232 --> 17:48.334
traditionally known
as a Lambrusco.
Mm.

17:48.334 --> 17:49.969
That's why we say...

17:49.969 --> 17:51.037
"Born in Italy.

17:51.037 --> 17:53.205
Perfected in California."

17:53.205 --> 17:55.107
So, Sharks,
who's ready to meet

17:55.107 --> 17:56.375
the greatest thing
to happen to pizza

17:56.375 --> 17:58.010
since the pepperoni...

17:58.010 --> 18:00.012
And turn any old pizza...

18:00.012 --> 18:01.380
...into a pizza...

18:01.380 --> 18:05.384
Together: ...party,
with Pie Wine!

18:05.384 --> 18:06.419
-Whoo-hoo!
-Good job.

18:06.419 --> 18:08.120
Alright. Salute!
Salute!

18:08.120 --> 18:09.155
Salud.

18:09.155 --> 18:11.424
Wow, you guys understood
the assignment.

18:11.424 --> 18:12.692
Well done. Nice pitch.
Thank you.
We do what we can.

18:12.692 --> 18:14.427
Of course, it'd be rude
if we were drinking alone,

18:14.427 --> 18:17.163
so we brought you
all three of our SKUs to try.
"White."

18:17.163 --> 18:18.731
The red
is our Sweet Za.

18:18.731 --> 18:21.467
The blue is
our White Crisp.
Classic Crisp.

18:21.467 --> 18:24.236
And the black is
our World Famous Red.

18:24.236 --> 18:25.671
Let's stand up.
Nelson: Okay.

18:25.671 --> 18:28.975
Very big tradition for many,
many years here in the Tank.
This is "Shark Tank" tradition.

Un, deux, trois.

18:32.044 --> 18:34.246
All: Chevaliers du Tastevin!

18:34.246 --> 18:36.215
Hey!
Mm.

18:36.215 --> 18:38.651
Ahh!

18:40.019 --> 18:41.487
Mmm!

18:41.487 --> 18:43.255
It's pretty darn good.
It's good!

18:43.255 --> 18:46.058
Thank you. We brought you
some pizza, by the way.

18:46.058 --> 18:47.360
O'Leary:
They're very, very good.

18:47.360 --> 18:50.463
I've never had wine
with pizza,

18:50.463 --> 18:52.531
and I didn't realize
it's so delicious.

18:52.531 --> 18:54.967
We're thinking, there's never
been an official drink of pizza.

18:54.967 --> 18:58.037
Now, they've tried to tell us
to drink beer with pizza.
Some people think it's beer.

18:58.037 --> 18:58.604
Yeah,
but beer with pizza...

18:58.604 --> 19:00.373
It's terrible.
...flavor profiles don't work.

19:00.373 --> 19:02.341
I agree with that. Too filling.
I need something with bubbles,

19:02.341 --> 19:04.443
so I think of a cola...
Exactly.

19:04.443 --> 19:06.212
...and I never
thought that...
But you're a man.

19:06.212 --> 19:07.279
You're a grown man.

19:07.279 --> 19:08.280
Yeah.
So, boom.

19:08.280 --> 19:09.615
There you go.
I like that.
Exactly.

19:09.615 --> 19:11.417
Greiner: Here's what's
confusing for me.

19:11.417 --> 19:14.487
I pick up the can.
I don't understand what this is.

19:14.487 --> 19:20.559
It says "World Famous Red,"
"Pizza & New Side Piece," "Pie."

19:20.559 --> 19:22.528
And I'm looking at this,
and I'm like,

19:22.528 --> 19:24.397
"This has something
to do with pizza,

19:24.397 --> 19:26.198
but I don't know what it is."

19:26.198 --> 19:27.500
I do find it really confusing,

19:27.500 --> 19:28.734
and I think
it's going to hurt you.

19:28.734 --> 19:32.104
Well, why don't we find out
if that issue is valid or not?

19:32.104 --> 19:33.272
What are your sales?
Yeah.

19:33.272 --> 19:34.974
So, we launched
two weeks ago.

19:34.974 --> 19:35.441
-Oh.
-Oh!

19:35.441 --> 19:36.642
Okay.
Two weeks ago.

19:36.642 --> 19:41.080
And here's the good news --
As of -- Early as today...

19:41.080 --> 19:43.315
We have distribution
in eight states.

19:43.315 --> 19:45.151
We've already had
distributor commitments

19:45.151 --> 19:48.220
for between $300,000
and $400,000 already,

19:48.220 --> 19:49.655
and we're talking
to 18 other states.

19:49.655 --> 19:52.358
Nevada --
Well, first of all,
congratulations.

19:52.358 --> 19:54.460
Congratulations.
But no sell-through date, right?

19:54.460 --> 19:57.329
Happy day. What does that mean
for dollars?

19:57.329 --> 19:59.432
$300,000 to $400,000
in wholesale dollars.

19:59.432 --> 20:00.633
Okay.
And we expect that

20:00.633 --> 20:03.402
to be well north of
a half a million in 30 days.

20:03.402 --> 20:05.304
And what we're projecting
for the first six months

20:05.304 --> 20:06.372
is about $1.5 million.

20:06.372 --> 20:09.208
In the end of the year,
about $6.5 million.

20:09.208 --> 20:10.409
Something I'm really
curious about --

20:10.409 --> 20:11.610
You started this
two weeks ago.

20:11.610 --> 20:14.180
This can't possibly be
your full-time job. Is it?

20:14.180 --> 20:15.581
We've been working on this
for two years.

20:15.581 --> 20:19.118
I actually host a morning radio
show on KROQ in Los Angeles.
Oh.

20:19.118 --> 20:20.553
Oh!
I knew you were familiar.

20:20.553 --> 20:23.022
I'm a radio guy.
I'm looking at you,
and I'm like,

20:23.022 --> 20:24.123
"I've seen your face."

the morning radio show.

20:25.291 --> 20:26.559
I've been doing morning radio
for about 20 years.

20:26.559 --> 20:28.160
So, I'm in
the fun business.

20:28.160 --> 20:29.228
-Nice.
-Yes, you are.

20:29.228 --> 20:30.496
This guy's the smart one.
I'm the smart ass.

20:30.496 --> 20:32.431
That's why we kind of
complement each other.

20:32.431 --> 20:34.333
My background is
I went to law school,

20:34.333 --> 20:35.501
got a master's
in accounting.

20:35.501 --> 20:38.137
I worked at bulge bracket
investment banking,

20:38.137 --> 20:40.272
and now I help run
one of the largest

20:40.272 --> 20:43.843

companies in the country.

20:43.843 --> 20:44.310

20:44.310 --> 20:45.444
I'm the CFO
of the company.

20:45.444 --> 20:47.379
I came in to help turn
around the business.

20:47.379 --> 20:49.215
So, guys, this is
a side hustle for you.

20:49.215 --> 20:52.118
No, it's not a side hustle.
I sold my 401(k) to do this.

20:52.118 --> 20:53.419
Like, I wish
I could say --
Oh, wow.

20:53.419 --> 20:55.221
How much have you invested
in the business?

20:55.221 --> 20:56.555
We've invested
over $300,000.

20:56.555 --> 20:58.724
Between the two of you?
So, are you 50/50 partners?
Correct.

20:58.724 --> 21:01.193
We're 50/50 partners.
You put in
the same amount of money?

21:01.193 --> 21:02.361

a little more than me.

21:02.361 --> 21:04.463
What have you done?
[ Scoffs ]
What have I done?

21:04.463 --> 21:08.000
I ended up talking to my wife,
we sold the house...

21:08.000 --> 21:08.701
-Oh.
-Wow.

21:08.701 --> 21:10.402
...so that we could use
some of that money...
Damn!

21:10.402 --> 21:11.537
So you're all in?
Wow.

21:11.537 --> 21:14.006
Green: We're invested.
Yeah, we're all in, big time.

21:14.006 --> 21:15.141
What are their margins?

21:15.141 --> 21:16.675
So, it costs us $1.50
right now to make.

21:16.675 --> 21:20.146
We have a plan to get it down
to $1.25 with more production,

21:20.146 --> 21:22.114
and we'll sell it
to distributors for $3.25.

21:22.114 --> 21:23.382
$3.25 a can.

21:23.382 --> 21:26.986
And then it would sell,
if you were at Ralphs
or Kroger, whatever,

21:26.986 --> 21:28.454
around $5, $5.50.

21:28.454 --> 21:31.157
There are other
canned sparkling wines.

21:31.157 --> 21:32.591
There are.
Who is your biggest competitor?

21:32.591 --> 21:35.628
Because I feel like the market
is really saturated.

21:35.628 --> 21:38.531
Looking at comps, Bev is one of
the comps that came out, and...

21:38.531 --> 21:41.133
Bev just got sold.
...Bev just got sold.

21:41.133 --> 21:42.468
They went out with
a pre-money valuation,

21:42.468 --> 21:44.637
before they had any sales,
at $7 million.

21:44.637 --> 21:47.606
We're doing a discount because
the truth is, we want a Shark.

21:47.606 --> 21:51.310
And I just want to circle back
to, like, what started this.

21:51.310 --> 21:52.545
I've known him since
we were 8 years old.

21:52.545 --> 21:56.048
I love the guy.
He's a big part of my life.

21:56.048 --> 21:57.416
I have
an amazing wife and kids.

21:57.416 --> 21:59.418
The last four years
have been a little challenging

21:59.418 --> 22:02.154
because my wife, unfortunately,
has metastatic cancer...

22:02.154 --> 22:03.055
-Oh, no.
-No.

22:03.055 --> 22:03.622
...and doing something

22:03.622 --> 22:07.226
with your best friend
is really exciting,

22:07.226 --> 22:08.627
and I want
to teach my kids.

22:08.627 --> 22:11.630
Hard work is so important.
Like, nothing's given.

22:11.630 --> 22:14.433
It's not a side hustle.
I zeroed out my 401(k).

22:14.433 --> 22:17.269
I don't think about, like,
oh, saving for the future.

22:17.269 --> 22:18.470
I wanted to do a business
with him

22:18.470 --> 22:21.106
because I love him and
I want to see him successful.

22:21.106 --> 22:22.608
I'm in business.
He hasn't been.

22:22.608 --> 22:25.477
But I want him to see
some of the successes I've had,

22:25.477 --> 22:29.215
and I love the idea, and I
wanted to be a part of it.

22:29.215 --> 22:32.151
Okay, guys,
fantastic presentation.

22:32.151 --> 22:33.686
Good news is,
this category's growing.

22:33.686 --> 22:36.522
For me, I'm launching
my own sparkling line,

22:36.522 --> 22:39.258
so I can't compete with myself,
obviously.

22:39.258 --> 22:41.393
But I hope
you get a deal here.

22:41.393 --> 22:43.329
It can't be me.
I'm out.

22:43.329 --> 22:44.763
Thank you so much for --

22:44.763 --> 22:49.168
We predicted which Shark
would be the first one to
go out, and look at this.

22:49.168 --> 22:51.203
I knew it. I knew it.
[ Laughter ]

22:51.203 --> 22:52.471
Isn't that amazing?
We knew.

22:52.471 --> 22:54.240
Well, you were right.
Well, we really
appreciate it.

22:54.240 --> 22:55.507
We'll be selling that
after the show today.

22:55.507 --> 22:58.110
I gotta keep that.
I look good in that.
Guys, let me go ahead --

Look, I love
what you guys are doing.

22:59.311 --> 23:01.247
The branding makes
perfect sense to me.

23:01.247 --> 23:03.249
This is right on target,
right on trend, right?

23:03.249 --> 23:05.384
Problem for me is
I've got BeatBox Beverages

23:05.384 --> 23:08.320
that's going to do $100 million
in sales this year,

23:08.320 --> 23:10.356
just raised at
a $200 million valuation.

23:10.356 --> 23:11.957
So, for those reasons,
I'm out.

23:11.957 --> 23:16.161
So, guys, I'm trying to think,
where can I add value in this?
Thank you so much, Mark.

23:16.161 --> 23:17.529
Um...

23:17.529 --> 23:19.531
Can I -- Can I make
you guys all an offer?

23:19.531 --> 23:23.402
If you don't like the deal,
we'll buy you out after a year.

23:23.402 --> 23:25.404
No strings attached.
No, you know what?

23:25.404 --> 23:27.439
That is very honorable.
It's not about liking the deal.

23:27.439 --> 23:30.175
It's about,
there's so many big players

23:30.175 --> 23:32.478
coming into this market
that I don't know

23:32.478 --> 23:36.148
if I'm really ready
to take that fight on,

23:36.148 --> 23:37.516
especially when there's
other Sharks right here

23:37.516 --> 23:40.252
that are doing
the same, exact thing.

23:40.252 --> 23:43.355
So, with that being said,
I'm out.

23:43.355 --> 23:44.690
Thank you, Daymond.

23:44.690 --> 23:49.295
Look, for me, there's just a few
boxes that aren't checked yet.

23:49.295 --> 23:51.864
It's just too early to invest.
I don't know enough yet.

good luck, but I'm out.
Thank you so much, Lori.

Nelson: Listen, I think you've
found a hyper niche here.

23:59.138 --> 24:01.507
Right? It's kitschy.
It's fun.

24:01.507 --> 24:05.311
I think it could potentially
have mass appeal.

24:05.311 --> 24:08.380
But it's a little too kitschy
for me.

24:08.380 --> 24:10.582
It's not the space
that I like to play in.

I just don't think
I'm your target market.

24:12.551 --> 24:13.585
And I'm worried --
Before you say it,

24:13.585 --> 24:15.254
I proposed to my wife
with a ring

when my daughter Eddy was 5,

25:56.522 --> 26:00.459
my whole world changed
when we found out she was blind.

26:00.459 --> 26:03.429

with refractive amblyopia,

26:03.429 --> 26:06.698

causes of childhood vision loss.

over the stronger eye

of the weaker eye.

26:19.478 --> 26:21.313

on the market

26:21.313 --> 26:24.249

an 84-acre farm in Alabama,

in summers.

34:38.209 --> 34:39.377

more important

off of that?

41:38.429 --> 41:40.298
I just know that Candace
is going to help

41:40.298 --> 41:42.367
my grandparents' spirit
be carried

41:42.367 --> 41:46.404
throughout my product
to bathrooms across the nation,

41:46.404 --> 41:47.739
which is literally
the best thing ever.

41:47.739 --> 41:52.443
It's such a blessing,
and I'm just so excited to have

41:52.443 --> 41:54.178
walked out of "Shark Tank"
with a deal today.

41:54.178 --> 41:55.246
So, yay!

41:55.246 --> 41:57.248
Kevin, you know,
we know you love money,

41:57.248 --> 42:00.084
but do you love the structures
that you create,

42:00.084 --> 42:01.352
because you will reduce

42:01.352 --> 42:02.920
your vulnerability
or your option to lose?

42:02.920 --> 42:08.559
Daymond, after all these years,
15 years of "Shark Tank"...
Yes. Yes. Yeah.

42:08.559 --> 42:11.129
...look at how much
I've taught you.

42:11.129 --> 42:12.730
Nothing.
You've learned, grasshopper.

42:12.730 --> 42:16.434
I learned more from Candace in
5 minutes than you for 15 years!

42:16.434 --> 42:17.468
Cuban: No, no, no.
Daymond, I love you.

42:17.468 --> 42:20.238
I disagree. Some of
the greatest knowledge

42:20.238 --> 42:21.739
comes from learning
what not to do.

42:21.739 --> 42:25.977
And Kevin has taught us
that every single show.
