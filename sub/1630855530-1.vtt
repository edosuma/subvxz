[man] Zoey, I've loved you
since the moment I saw you.

00:32.266 --> 00:34.602
You knocked me off my feet,
remember?

00:35.303 --> 00:37.871
I knew even then,
and I think you did too,

00:37.971 --> 00:40.808
that what we've got
is something special,

00:40.908 --> 00:42.176
something powerful,

00:42.276 --> 00:43.211
something real.

00:44.145 --> 00:48.082
When I look into your eyes,
I see our whole lives.

00:48.182 --> 00:49.983
The good days, the bad days,

00:50.084 --> 00:51.652

00:51.752 --> 00:54.855
I... I want to do it all, Zoey!

00:55.589 --> 00:57.558
As long as I can do it
with you.

00:58.459 --> 00:59.860
And sure, it won't be perfect,

00:59.960 --> 01:02.796
but nothing in this world
is perfect,

01:02.896 --> 01:04.098
except for you.

I'm ready to build a life,

with one question.

Zoey...

01:17.311 --> 01:18.646
Zoey...

01:19.347 --> 01:21.582

01:23.251 --> 01:24.485

Two perfect dates
that I would like to turn

01:39.032 --> 01:42.170
into forever, so, will you
make me the happiest--

01:42.270 --> 01:44.037
No, no, definitely not,
absolutely not.

01:44.138 --> 01:45.639
Not in a million years, no!

01:45.739 --> 01:47.341
Well, maybe
if you said "yes" now,

01:47.441 --> 01:49.076
and then we could talk
about it later.

01:50.478 --> 01:51.812
Yeah. Hi.

01:53.080 --> 01:55.216
You know this is weird, right?

01:55.316 --> 01:56.750
Yeah, I know it's weird.

01:56.850 --> 02:00.120
Just, I'm 30 and a half
and I live with my mom,

02:00.221 --> 02:02.556
and I'm the lead singer
of a Maroon 5 cover band.

02:02.656 --> 02:05.226
I don't really get
a lot of second dates.

02:05.326 --> 02:08.262
Thank you for your honesty,
Byron.

I'm sure there's someone
out there for you,

02:10.497 --> 02:12.433
it just isn't me.

02:13.201 --> 02:15.035
So I need to leave.

02:15.803 --> 02:17.538
Yeah, that, uh,
that makes sense.

02:17.638 --> 02:18.872
You gonna be all right?

02:18.972 --> 02:21.108
Oh yeah, I'm, uh,
yeah, I'll be fine.

02:21.209 --> 02:22.210
All right.

02:22.310 --> 02:23.211
So I'll call you?

02:23.311 --> 02:24.678
Please don't.

all the girls with their moms?

for the new girl?

07:45.566 --> 07:48.068
Did we ever get permission
to use Pontiac for the car?

07:48.168 --> 07:50.270
We are the number one show
on the network.

07:50.370 --> 07:53.006
We don't ask Pontiac,
we tell them.

07:53.106 --> 07:55.207
In fact, tell Pontiac,
if they don't like it,

07:55.308 --> 07:58.345
they can kiss
my tiny little nuts.

07:58.445 --> 07:59.713

than any of the guys!

I can get you a new one.

I'm fine. I like my car.

09:03.476 --> 09:06.379
Isn't it crazy
that I started as your intern,

09:06.479 --> 09:09.116
and now like, we're...
like, I'm like...

09:09.216 --> 09:11.418
like a little above...
like it's crazy.

09:11.518 --> 09:14.588
What's crazy is that Kelley
lets you take home the show car

09:14.688 --> 09:16.089
but I can't even get him
to look at me.

09:16.189 --> 09:18.626
That's because Kelley
is obsessed with me.

09:18.726 --> 09:19.827
It would be like gross

09:19.927 --> 09:21.561
if it didn't come
with some perks.

I just think
about all the things

09:23.096 --> 09:24.698
I dreamed about
in high school,

09:24.798 --> 09:26.466
and now I'm here,
and it's like,

09:26.566 --> 09:28.068
is this it, is this the dream?

09:28.602 --> 09:31.338
It's really gross how often
you talk about high school.

09:31.438 --> 09:33.674
[soft music playing]

09:33.774 --> 09:36.309
No, but seriously,
just break the rules.

09:36.409 --> 09:38.411
There are two types
of people, right?

09:38.511 --> 09:40.147
Sharks and minnows.

09:41.548 --> 09:43.183
I'm obviously a shark,

09:43.283 --> 09:44.852
and you're-you're a minnow.

09:44.952 --> 09:45.886
I'm not a minnow.

09:45.986 --> 09:47.988
Okay, then prove it.

09:48.088 --> 09:50.891
If you want Kelley's attention,
just do what I did.

09:50.991 --> 09:52.392
What did you do?

09:52.492 --> 09:55.295
I solicited him for nudes
and then I blackmailed him.

09:57.297 --> 09:59.432
[laughing]

09:59.532 --> 10:00.768
I'm joking!

10:00.868 --> 10:02.670
You're crazy!

10:02.770 --> 10:06.874
Um, no, I applied for the job.

10:09.843 --> 10:11.044
If it makes you feel better,

10:11.144 --> 10:13.546
I really thought
the promotion was yours.

10:13.647 --> 10:15.448
You deserve it more than anyone,

10:15.548 --> 10:17.117
including me.

10:17.217 --> 10:19.119
I make way too much money.

10:19.219 --> 10:21.121
-You wanna go to sushi?
-[ding]

10:21.221 --> 10:22.956
Take me to SUGARFISH.

10:23.056 --> 10:24.958
[male voice] Taking you
to SUGARFISH.

10:25.058 --> 10:26.559
-[Zoey] Archer!
-[cars honking]

10:26.660 --> 10:28.028
It's totally fine.

10:28.128 --> 10:29.930
This drives itself,
we can just relax.

10:30.030 --> 10:31.231
Sit back, relax.

10:31.331 --> 10:32.966
[male voice] Door closing.

10:33.066 --> 10:35.068
[soft music playing]

10:35.168 --> 10:37.671
[car beeps to mimic
a wolf whistle]

10:46.513 --> 10:47.614
[keys jingling]

10:53.053 --> 10:54.955
[phone ringing]

11:01.962 --> 11:03.396
-Hey!
-Hi!

11:03.496 --> 11:05.999
-Did you get it?
-The promotion? No.

11:06.099 --> 11:09.402
Sexism is still alive and well
in Hollywood, baby!

11:09.502 --> 11:10.738
What?!

11:10.838 --> 11:12.005
Those idiots.

11:12.105 --> 11:14.407
But no, the package,
I meant the package,

11:14.507 --> 11:16.176
Oh, uh, yeah.

11:16.276 --> 11:18.245
-Five minutes, Ms. Pensky.
-Thank you.

11:18.345 --> 11:20.580
You in London? I thought your
keynote wasn't 'til next week.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.249
We're pre-taping it
for the product launch.

11:22.349 --> 11:24.017
Open it.
I only have a few minutes.

11:25.485 --> 11:28.255
The new TekMate?!
These aren't even out yet!

11:28.355 --> 11:30.290
I guess it pays
to know the inventor!

11:30.390 --> 11:32.425
Don't you want to turn it on?

11:32.525 --> 11:33.493
[whirring]

11:33.593 --> 11:35.595
Wow, the unbreakable
see-through phone.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.865
It's even better in person!

11:37.965 --> 11:39.399
[laughs]
Oh my God.

11:39.499 --> 11:41.969
Did I tell you that I got
proposed to the other night

11:42.069 --> 11:44.037
on a second date?

11:44.137 --> 11:45.505
It's like the second we turn 30,

11:45.605 --> 11:48.275
everybody just
becomes obsessed with...

11:49.309 --> 11:51.344
"Will you be my maid..."

11:51.444 --> 11:52.512
Wait, what is...

11:52.612 --> 11:53.747
No.

11:53.847 --> 11:54.915
Shut up!

11:55.015 --> 11:56.683
Quinn and Logan
are getting married!

11:56.784 --> 11:58.185
-[shushing]
-Sorry.

11:59.419 --> 12:01.354
He met me in London
and surprised me with a trip

12:01.454 --> 12:03.456
to the Netherlands.
He even chartered a plane,

12:03.556 --> 12:05.893
which is so environmentally
irresponsible, but...

12:05.993 --> 12:07.694
-Of course he did!
-Of course he did!

12:07.795 --> 12:09.029
So, I just called Michael,

12:09.129 --> 12:10.898
and he is obsessed
with being the officiant.

12:10.998 --> 12:14.501
And I got off the phone with
Chase, and he is freaking out!

12:14.601 --> 12:17.004
Oh. Hi-hi, Zoey!

12:17.104 --> 12:18.171
So you heard.

12:18.271 --> 12:20.473
-She finally said yes!
-Hey, Logan!

12:20.573 --> 12:23.376
And it only took you 50 times.
Congrats!

12:23.476 --> 12:25.879
Okay, so I know it's
almost like too soon,

12:25.979 --> 12:27.815
but the wedding
has to be August 26th.

12:27.915 --> 12:29.582
Long story short,
product launch,

12:29.682 --> 12:31.919
it's the only time I'm free
for the next two years.

12:32.019 --> 12:34.855
And I don't know what I'd do
without my best friend there.

12:34.955 --> 12:36.289
So what do you say?

12:39.392 --> 12:41.394
You know, I thought
I was gonna have to work,

12:41.494 --> 12:43.263
but looks like I'm totally free!

12:43.696 --> 12:46.699
Thank you. Hey, you wanna get me
a water before I go on?

12:46.800 --> 12:48.568
Anything for my fiancee.

12:50.103 --> 12:52.005
Zo, you know
it's gonna be fine, right?

12:52.105 --> 12:54.241
Chase is gonna be there.
It's gonna be fine.

12:54.341 --> 12:56.343
More than fine,
it's gonna be fun.

12:56.443 --> 12:58.278
No one gets to see you anymore
except me.

12:58.378 --> 12:59.913
It'll be the reunion
we all need.

13:00.013 --> 13:01.181
I gotta go, love you.

13:01.281 --> 13:02.850
[announcer] Please welcome
inventor

13:02.950 --> 13:04.751
Quinn Pensky.

13:04.852 --> 13:07.554
[applause]

13:08.155 --> 13:09.122
[phone beeps]

13:12.725 --> 13:13.927
I need another drink.

13:14.027 --> 13:15.128
* You used to know me... *

13:15.228 --> 13:17.330
"No one sees you anymore."

13:17.430 --> 13:18.966
[sighs]
I see people.

13:19.066 --> 13:20.600
Just because I haven't seen them
in a while

13:20.700 --> 13:22.235
doesn't mean we aren't friends,
right?

13:22.335 --> 13:24.237
I have a lot of friends,
see a lot of people.

13:24.337 --> 13:26.306
Even if I had the option,
I'm too busy.

13:26.406 --> 13:27.975
I'm really busy all the time.

13:28.075 --> 13:32.145
* I used to be your angel,
now I'm walking out your door *

13:32.245 --> 13:34.047
* You say I'm turnin' evil *

13:34.147 --> 13:36.083
* I'll say I'm finally pure *

13:36.183 --> 13:38.185
* Shine bright
in my reflection *

13:38.285 --> 13:40.353
* Think I lost myself before *

13:40.453 --> 13:43.256
* Held me back,
tied me up inside a cage *

13:43.356 --> 13:45.492
* Had to change my life *

13:45.592 --> 13:48.128
* 'Cause I knew
you'd stay the same *

13:48.228 --> 13:51.764
* Couldn't see you were
standing in my way *

13:52.332 --> 13:54.467
* I can see clearly now,
now, now *

13:54.567 --> 13:57.104
* You used to know me,
now you don't *

13:58.471 --> 14:02.242
* You used to hypnotize me,
did it so easy *

14:02.642 --> 14:05.045
* You used to know me,
now you don't *

14:05.145 --> 14:06.980
Of course I had questions.

14:07.447 --> 14:09.216
Who snuck into Sunday school?

14:09.316 --> 14:11.051
Who stole the Subaru?

14:11.451 --> 14:14.021
And who stabbed
Sarabella Samson?

14:14.754 --> 14:19.326
I'm Stacey Dillsen, and this
is My Favorite Slaughters.

14:20.994 --> 14:25.098
* I'm like a flower blooming
since I left you behind *

14:25.198 --> 14:27.034
* Don't know what I was doing *

14:27.134 --> 14:29.436
-Woo!
-Make a wish!

14:29.536 --> 14:33.573
* Knew you were turning evil,
you said I lost my mind *

14:33.673 --> 14:37.144
* No, you ain't gonna do me
like that *

14:37.244 --> 14:40.813
* Held me back,
tied me up inside a cage *

14:40.914 --> 14:42.615
* Had to change my life *

14:42.715 --> 14:45.518
* 'Cause I knew
you'd stay the same... *

14:46.719 --> 14:47.887
[laughter]

14:47.988 --> 14:49.622
Is there shellfish in this?

14:49.722 --> 14:50.924
[all shouting]

14:51.925 --> 14:52.926
No shellfish!

14:53.026 --> 14:54.394
* Now you don't *

14:55.762 --> 14:59.299
* You used to hypnotize me,
did it so easy *

14:59.799 --> 15:02.502
* You used to know me,
now you don't *

15:02.970 --> 15:04.304
[yawns]

15:15.482 --> 15:19.119
* Don't go through
your camera roll *

15:19.652 --> 15:22.055
* So much you don't know *

15:22.522 --> 15:25.825
* That you've forgotten *

15:25.925 --> 15:27.194
* What a trip *

15:27.627 --> 15:29.629
* The way you can flip *

15:29.729 --> 15:32.465
* Through all
the good parts of it *

15:32.565 --> 15:36.303
* I shouldn't have done it *

15:36.403 --> 15:39.039
* Chronological order *

15:39.139 --> 15:41.408
* And nothing but torture *

15:41.508 --> 15:43.443
* Scroll too far back... *

15:43.543 --> 15:45.445
[Zoey]

15:47.014 --> 15:49.482
* I don't want to see 'em *

15:49.582 --> 15:52.085
* But I can't delete 'em... *

15:52.185 --> 15:54.887
What's goin' on?
Yeah, give it to me.

15:55.355 --> 15:58.225
Psh! Nice work.
Yeah? Okay, here we go.

15:59.626 --> 16:01.228
Oh, yeah. You're good at that.

16:01.328 --> 16:03.796
Oh, yeah, you wanna fistbump?
Let's go. All right.

16:07.567 --> 16:09.469
* All the best *

16:10.537 --> 16:12.772
[Zoey]

16:18.178 --> 16:20.613
Chase, I'm really sorry
about Hawaii.

16:20.713 --> 16:23.583
But we were kids.
Can we talk?

16:26.253 --> 16:28.055
[Zoey]

16:28.521 --> 16:30.557
Oh, no, no, no, no.

16:34.427 --> 16:35.928
Oh, no. Oh...

16:43.670 --> 16:44.771
[dings]

16:48.875 --> 16:50.610
[electricity buzzing]

16:50.710 --> 16:53.080
[Archer] You're watching
LOVE: Fully Charged.

16:53.180 --> 16:55.315
No peeking. No peeking.
No peeking.

16:55.415 --> 16:56.983
Okay, hang on. Hang on.

16:57.084 --> 17:00.187
You ready? Three, two, one.

17:00.287 --> 17:02.389
-Ta-da!
-[all cheer]

17:02.489 --> 17:06.193
Jordan B., what's going on?
Did you do all this?

17:06.292 --> 17:07.560
No.

17:08.994 --> 17:10.463
I mean, yes.

17:10.563 --> 17:13.566
Jordyn J., I know it's only
our second date,

17:13.665 --> 17:15.867
but there's something
I want to ask you.

17:15.968 --> 17:17.337
Oh, my God.

17:17.436 --> 17:18.905
Oh my God!

17:20.272 --> 17:21.708
Yeah?

17:22.509 --> 17:23.976
-[music ends]
-[nearby chatter]

17:24.077 --> 17:25.545
Um...

17:25.978 --> 17:27.314
Yes?

17:27.946 --> 17:29.082
Um...

17:29.782 --> 17:30.583
Um...

17:30.683 --> 17:32.051
[Kelley]
What is wrong with him?

17:32.152 --> 17:33.253
[Jordan B.]
Um...

17:33.353 --> 17:34.487
Greg, what is wrong with him?

17:34.587 --> 17:36.123
I don't know.
He's never like this.

17:36.223 --> 17:39.992
Yo, I'm so sorry, but before
I do this, can I talk to Zoey?

17:40.093 --> 17:41.794
Who the hell is Zoey?

17:41.894 --> 17:43.163
Ah!

17:43.663 --> 17:46.966
[inhales and exhales slowly]

17:48.401 --> 17:50.437
Zoey, you embarrassed me.

17:50.537 --> 17:52.805
The network loved Greg's idea
of the proposal,

17:52.905 --> 17:54.941
and then Jordan B. goes
on one knee and is like,

17:55.041 --> 17:58.745
"Uh, I need Zoey. Where's Zoey?
Zoey, where's Zoey?"

18:00.513 --> 18:02.682
Well, where were you, Zoey?

18:03.350 --> 18:05.218
You put me on
submission tape duty.

18:05.785 --> 18:07.887
You are not here to answer.

18:07.987 --> 18:09.956
You are here to listen.

18:10.357 --> 18:13.393
I do not like Jordan B.

18:13.493 --> 18:15.428
He acts like a baby.

18:15.528 --> 18:17.797
But America disagrees.

18:18.165 --> 18:19.199
It's probably the hair.

18:19.299 --> 18:20.967
And if my prediction is right,

18:21.568 --> 18:23.069
he's gonna go to the finals.

18:23.736 --> 18:26.639
And when he does,
I need you...

18:27.407 --> 18:28.641
to be...

18:29.242 --> 18:30.477
his mommy.

18:31.178 --> 18:32.212
Mommy?

18:32.645 --> 18:33.880
-Yes.
-[joints creak]

18:34.381 --> 18:35.815
[yelps]

18:38.551 --> 18:41.288
When he is "hungy,"
you will feed him.

18:41.388 --> 18:44.891
When he is crabby,
you will check his diapey.

18:44.991 --> 18:46.559
And when we go live,

18:46.659 --> 18:50.697
you will be in his ears
telling him exactly what to say,

18:50.797 --> 18:55.368
because I will not
be embarrassed again.

18:55.868 --> 18:57.370
Does this mean
I'm on the live team?

18:57.470 --> 18:59.439
-Yeah, fine, on the live team.
-Yes!

19:00.273 --> 19:01.841
Oh, God.

19:02.809 --> 19:07.347
No, uh, wait, I cannot tell you
how long I waited to do this,

19:07.447 --> 19:08.948
but I don't know if I can accept

19:09.048 --> 19:11.218
because it is the same weekend
as my best friend's wedding--

19:11.318 --> 19:12.852
I was not asking, okay?

19:12.952 --> 19:15.722
Whatever your plans are,
cancel, okay?

19:15.822 --> 19:16.923
You're busy.

19:18.725 --> 19:20.893
-Thank you.
-Thank you so much.

19:22.962 --> 19:23.930
[exhales]

19:24.030 --> 19:25.031
One more.

19:25.131 --> 19:27.500
[sighs] One for the one.
Just a little one.

19:29.369 --> 19:30.337
[groans]

19:30.437 --> 19:32.572
[gentle music playing]

19:38.645 --> 19:41.881
Quinn, it's me,
your maid of honor.

19:42.749 --> 19:44.517
I can't come to your wedding.

19:44.617 --> 19:46.353
I know it's the most
important day of your life,

19:46.453 --> 19:47.820
but I have to work.

19:48.421 --> 19:50.022
Oh, I hate this.

19:50.122 --> 19:51.458
-Zoey!
-[gasps]

19:51.558 --> 19:53.192
-Hi! Oh!
-Hi!

19:53.693 --> 19:55.662
Oh, my God,
I'm so glad you're here.

19:55.762 --> 19:57.430
My family's already
driving me nuts.

19:57.530 --> 19:58.798
Bubbe says I'm too pale.

19:58.898 --> 20:00.467
My mom thinks I should add
a belt to the dress.

20:00.567 --> 20:02.235
-And Logan's sister Lyric is--
-Quinn.

20:02.335 --> 20:03.703
-Lyric. Hi.
-I need to talk to you

20:03.803 --> 20:05.137
-about your wedding present.
-Right now?

20:05.238 --> 20:06.239
Yes.

20:06.339 --> 20:07.274
My gift is an original song.

20:07.374 --> 20:08.475
That is so thoughtful.

20:08.575 --> 20:10.243
That I will be performing

20:10.610 --> 20:12.111
as you walk down the aisle.

20:13.913 --> 20:16.349
Lyric is an up-and-coming
singer/songwriter.

20:16.449 --> 20:18.585
I specialize
in EDM/deep house/country-folk.

20:18.685 --> 20:21.020
-It's like a whole thing.
-Lyric, about the gift--

20:21.120 --> 20:22.789
Shh.

20:23.656 --> 20:25.792
[vocalizing individual notes]

20:28.628 --> 20:30.263
Ooh, that's really good.

20:30.863 --> 20:32.832
Uh, sorry, the melody
just came to me.

20:33.766 --> 20:38.538
I need to lay this down.
Siri, open voice memos.

20:39.105 --> 20:40.573
What I would give
for the confidence

20:40.673 --> 20:42.275
of a trust fund kid.

20:43.543 --> 20:45.177
[sighs]
Um, Quinn,

20:45.278 --> 20:47.714
there is something I really
need to talk to you about.

20:47.814 --> 20:49.382
Ready, Miss Pensky?

20:49.482 --> 20:50.717
Oh.

20:51.351 --> 20:52.819
I'm sorry, I-- I gotta go.

20:52.919 --> 20:55.021
-Talk later? Okay.
-Yeah, okay.

20:55.555 --> 20:56.823
Thank you.

21:00.159 --> 21:02.161
-[sighs]
-[Stacey] I hope she shows up.

21:02.261 --> 21:04.297
[Camille] Zoey? The maid
of honor? Why wouldn't she?

21:04.397 --> 21:05.598
[Stacey] Because she never
shows up.

21:05.698 --> 21:07.066
And it's not like we don't
invite her.

21:07.166 --> 21:09.135
Now that you mention it,
I worked with Quinn five years

21:09.235 --> 21:11.471
-and I still haven't met her.
-[Stacey] My theory is

21:11.571 --> 21:13.272
I think she's still stuck
on her ex, Chase.

21:13.373 --> 21:15.875
-[Camille] The best man?
-[Stacey] From high school.

21:15.975 --> 21:17.877
It's sad. They were supposed
to spend the summer

21:17.977 --> 21:20.813
after senior year together
in Hawaii,

21:20.913 --> 21:22.114
but something
must have happened,

21:22.214 --> 21:23.883
because they broke up,
and I don't think

21:23.983 --> 21:25.452
she's had a relationship since.

21:25.552 --> 21:26.919
[Camille]
Oh, no. Poor thing.

21:27.019 --> 21:29.055
And if she does show,
it's going to be uncomfortable,

21:29.155 --> 21:31.658
because I don't think she knows
Chase has a girlfriend.

21:31.758 --> 21:34.293
A serious one. We had dinner
with them in Baltimore

21:34.394 --> 21:36.095
when I was touring for my pod.

21:36.195 --> 21:37.229
She's a teacher too.

21:37.330 --> 21:38.565
They're so cute together.

21:38.665 --> 21:40.199
[exclaiming]

21:40.667 --> 21:42.435
-Oh, my goodness.
-Zoey?

21:42.535 --> 21:45.171
-Are you okay?
-I'm good. I'm so good.

21:46.939 --> 21:49.108
Your maid of honor
has arrived!

21:49.208 --> 21:50.977
-Hey!
-Hi!

21:51.611 --> 21:53.413
It looks like you could use
a little drink.

21:53.513 --> 21:54.981
Thank you.

21:56.048 --> 21:57.850
[gulping loudly]

22:00.052 --> 22:01.253
[sighs]

22:01.354 --> 22:02.622
[laughs]

22:02.722 --> 22:05.191
Miss Pensky,
you look beautiful!

22:05.291 --> 22:07.059
It is so good to see you, Zoey.

22:07.159 --> 22:09.862
Oh, this is my mom,
Quinn's grandma.

22:09.962 --> 22:12.131
Not grandma. Never grandma.

22:12.231 --> 22:13.232
Bubbe.

22:13.332 --> 22:14.333
Nice to meet you.

22:14.434 --> 22:15.768
Well, how's your family?

22:15.868 --> 22:17.470
What is that little brother
of yours up to?

22:17.570 --> 22:19.406
Not so little anymore.

22:19.506 --> 22:21.908
He has two kids and twins on
the way, if you can believe it.

22:22.008 --> 22:24.243
You all need to stop
growing up.

22:24.343 --> 22:26.112
-Mm-hmm.
-Zoey!

22:26.513 --> 22:29.315
-It's been so long!
-Hi, Stacey!

22:29.416 --> 22:31.083
[Zoey laughs]

22:31.183 --> 22:32.885
And you must be Camille.

22:32.985 --> 22:35.054
Yes, it's so nice
to finally meet you.

22:35.154 --> 22:37.924
We were just wondering whether
or not you were gonna make it.

22:38.024 --> 22:40.760
I know. I'm late, but I was at
my boyfriend's house.

22:40.860 --> 22:42.395
Lost track of time.

22:42.495 --> 22:44.397
Boyfriend? Since when?

22:44.497 --> 22:45.765
It's recent,
but enough about me.

22:45.865 --> 22:48.300
Now, don't make us wait
until the wedding, Zoey.

22:48.401 --> 22:49.702
Come on, give us the deets.

22:49.802 --> 22:51.003
Yeah, yeah. What's his name?

22:51.103 --> 22:54.741
Uh, his... his name is, um...

22:55.374 --> 22:56.375
um...

22:56.476 --> 22:57.477
Hemsworth.

22:57.577 --> 22:59.211
Hugo Hemsworth.

22:59.311 --> 23:01.514
Hemsworth? Is he Australian?

23:01.614 --> 23:02.815
Yeah.

23:03.382 --> 23:05.885
Like Liam and Chris Hemsworth?

23:05.985 --> 23:07.954
They're distant cousins.

23:08.054 --> 23:09.722
-Oh! What does he do?
-What?

23:09.822 --> 23:12.425
He is a doctor.

23:12.525 --> 23:13.893
Surgeon, actually.

23:13.993 --> 23:16.095
-[Stacey] Wow!
-[Camille] Dr. Hemsworth.

23:16.195 --> 23:17.163
She's ready.

23:17.263 --> 23:18.431
Oh, thank God.

23:20.600 --> 23:22.101
[tender music playing]

23:22.201 --> 23:23.736
[all gasp]

23:26.639 --> 23:28.040
She looks great.

23:31.611 --> 23:33.112
You look amazing.

23:37.884 --> 23:39.418
How do you feel?

23:40.086 --> 23:42.221
Like I'd rather be getting
married in a lab coat.

23:42.689 --> 23:44.857
It's perfect. You're perfect.

23:44.957 --> 23:46.493
You're a little pale.

23:46.893 --> 23:48.260
Could use a belt.

23:48.360 --> 23:49.962
[excited chatter]

23:51.898 --> 23:54.166
-I'll see you soon.
-All right. Bye!

23:54.266 --> 23:56.302
-Uh, hey, where's your car?
-Oh, it's in the shop.

23:56.402 --> 23:58.738
-Oh. Do you need a ride?
-That's so sweet,

23:58.838 --> 24:00.139
but my boyfriend's
picking me up.

24:00.239 --> 24:03.142
-Wha-what?
-Actually, his car is.

24:03.810 --> 24:05.077
It drives itself.

24:05.177 --> 24:06.779
Self-driving?

24:06.879 --> 24:08.414
-Fancy!
-Yes.

24:08.515 --> 24:09.682
[laughs]

24:09.782 --> 24:12.985
Uh, excuse me? Boyfriend?
What did I miss?

24:13.085 --> 24:14.386
Is this what you wanted
to talk about?

24:14.487 --> 24:16.455
Oh my God, are you
bringing him to the wedding?

24:16.556 --> 24:17.657
-This is huge!
-No, no, no.

24:17.757 --> 24:19.191
It's way too late
to add a plus-one.

24:19.291 --> 24:22.328
No, it's not. I'm literally
texting our wedding planner.

24:22.428 --> 24:25.331
Which reminds me, would you mind
going to Santa Barbara?

24:25.431 --> 24:27.767
Logan is getting the rings
resized at some fancy place,

24:27.867 --> 24:30.169
and there is no one I trust
more than you.

24:30.269 --> 24:31.671
Do you mind?

24:32.304 --> 24:34.774
-I don't mind. I'll do it.
-Thank you.

24:34.874 --> 24:36.543
Oh! I love you.

24:36.643 --> 24:38.511
-Mwah.
-Love you. Bye!

24:40.980 --> 24:43.482
[Zoey] And that's when
I knew I had to do both:

24:43.583 --> 24:45.284
the wedding and the finale.

24:45.952 --> 24:48.120
* Used to be a baby,
used to be a lady *

24:48.220 --> 24:51.223
* Thought you were
the perfect lover... *

24:51.991 --> 24:53.526
[Zoey] If I was going
to pull this off,

24:53.626 --> 24:54.994
I needed three things:

24:55.094 --> 24:57.697
A boyfriend, a car,
and a plan.

24:58.297 --> 24:59.932
The wedding is happening
at 4:00 p.m.

25:00.032 --> 25:01.868
at Logan's family estate
in Malibu.

25:01.968 --> 25:04.103
The live finale is happening
at 5:00 p.m.

25:04.203 --> 25:05.605
at the LOVE: Fully Charged
stage,

25:05.705 --> 25:07.674
just 2.3 miles up the road.

25:07.774 --> 25:09.075
By the time I'm needed on set,

25:09.175 --> 25:11.043
the wedding reception
will be in full swing.

25:11.143 --> 25:12.378
I'll slip away
to work the finale,

25:12.478 --> 25:14.446
and be back before
anyone notices I'm gone.

25:14.547 --> 25:15.782
It's foolproof.

25:15.882 --> 25:17.717
Next, I needed a car.

25:17.817 --> 25:19.018
A self-driving car.

25:19.118 --> 25:20.519
Securing the keys was easy.

25:20.620 --> 25:23.122
Kelley lets Archer take
the LUV-6 whenever he wants,

25:23.222 --> 25:24.891
and he was happy
to hand them over.

25:24.991 --> 25:26.559
[Archer]
Wait, you're taking the car?

25:26.659 --> 25:28.227
Zoey, get back here!

25:28.327 --> 25:30.196
What? Ugh!

25:30.930 --> 25:32.231
* Time to walk *

25:32.331 --> 25:33.666
Ugh, thank God.

25:33.766 --> 25:35.267
[slurps]

25:35.768 --> 25:38.370
The student
has become the master.

25:38.971 --> 25:41.007
[Zoey] Now, all I needed
was a date.

25:41.107 --> 25:43.475
But where I was supposed
to find a hotshot

25:43.576 --> 25:46.613
Australian ER surgeon
whose name was Hugo Hemsworth?

25:46.713 --> 25:48.514
Yo, what's up?
My name is Dragon.

25:48.615 --> 25:49.982
My real name is Vantarius,

25:50.082 --> 25:51.818
but I'm a really big
Game of Thrones fan,

25:51.918 --> 25:54.286
so I legally changed my name
when I turned 18.

25:54.386 --> 25:56.656
[grunts]

25:56.756 --> 25:58.991
Come on,
who can say no to this?

25:59.425 --> 26:02.595
My name's Spencer,
and I know what women want.

26:03.996 --> 26:05.698
[Zoey]
He probably didn't exist.

26:05.798 --> 26:08.067
What I needed was an actor.

26:08.167 --> 26:10.870
Hello, my name
is Todd E. Schupert.

26:10.970 --> 26:12.171
I'm 28 years old.

26:12.271 --> 26:13.539
I'm an actor from Burbank,
California.

26:13.640 --> 26:16.709
I can also do accents.
I can do Australian.

26:16.809 --> 26:19.511
[in Australian accent] I just
came out from Bondi Beach.

26:19.612 --> 26:21.213
G'day, how are ya?

26:21.313 --> 26:23.282
[Zoey]
And that's where you come in.

26:24.016 --> 26:25.051
Looking at your résumé,

26:25.151 --> 26:27.153
I can see that you have
years of training,

26:27.253 --> 26:29.321
dozens of student films
under your belt.

26:29.421 --> 26:30.757
BFA in Acting.

26:31.290 --> 26:34.694
Oh, and a minor
in Early Childhood Development.

26:34.794 --> 26:36.262
-Cool.
-No, no, no.

26:36.362 --> 26:39.498
I manny for family
on the side.

26:40.066 --> 26:42.201
Okay, I can quit if you need.

26:42.301 --> 26:45.604
No major TV shows or movies.
That's great.

26:46.138 --> 26:48.007
Okay, so, sorry,
what does this have to do

26:48.107 --> 26:50.977
with me getting on
LOVE: Fully Charged ?

26:51.077 --> 26:53.312
Todd, I'm not here
to talk to you

26:53.412 --> 26:55.247
about being on
LOVE: Fully Charged.

26:57.016 --> 26:59.285
I saw your submission tape,

26:59.385 --> 27:01.888
and I used my position of power
to get you here.

27:01.988 --> 27:04.556
That was wrong,
and I'm sorry about that.

27:05.457 --> 27:07.559
Okay, so why am I here?

27:07.660 --> 27:08.961
I need a favor.

27:09.495 --> 27:12.531
I need someone
to play my boyfriend

27:12.631 --> 27:14.566
at my best friend's wedding
next weekend.

27:15.134 --> 27:16.803
I need them to fully commit

27:16.903 --> 27:19.505
the way only a real actor can.

27:22.842 --> 27:25.912
Okay. So, like, method.

27:27.646 --> 27:29.548
Sure. Yeah.

27:32.719 --> 27:34.353
-[sighs]
-I...

27:34.453 --> 27:36.188
I don't know why I thought
this was a good idea.

27:36.288 --> 27:37.990
Forget I asked. I am sorry.

27:38.090 --> 27:40.526
No, no, no.
Okay, if I do this,

27:40.626 --> 27:42.128
can you get me on the show?

27:42.228 --> 27:45.564
I mean, I can certainly try.

27:47.867 --> 27:49.168
That's good enough for me.

27:49.268 --> 27:50.703
* You and me
are through, though *

27:50.803 --> 27:52.071
* Watch me hit it solo *

27:52.171 --> 27:54.774
* I'm gonna do it a cappella,
yeah *

27:54.874 --> 27:56.408
[Zoey]
Is this completely insane?

27:56.508 --> 27:59.545
Which part, hiring a super-hot
actor to play your boyfriend

27:59.645 --> 28:01.513
at your best friend's wedding,
or agreeing to be at work

28:01.613 --> 28:03.682
the same weekend
as your best friend's wedding?

28:03.783 --> 28:05.084
The boyfriend part.

28:05.184 --> 28:06.753
Convincing your friends
you have a hot boyfriend

28:06.853 --> 28:09.722
is the least of your concerns
if he doesn't watch the road.

28:09.822 --> 28:10.990
Does he know what he's doing?

28:11.090 --> 28:12.524
[Zoey]
The car drives itself,

28:12.624 --> 28:15.094
and it performed very well
during the safety testing phase.

28:15.194 --> 28:17.429
It ran over six
crash dummies.

28:18.564 --> 28:20.332
Um, hello? Arch?

28:20.432 --> 28:23.402
I'm losing you
driving through the canyon.

28:23.502 --> 28:24.603
Bad service.

28:24.703 --> 28:26.873
The car will be back
before the show goes live.

28:26.973 --> 28:28.207
Okay, bye!

28:29.641 --> 28:31.110
It's the red button, Zoey.

28:31.210 --> 28:33.679
Big red button. Center.
Yeah, right there. End--

28:37.016 --> 28:38.484
Uh, what are you reading?

28:38.584 --> 28:41.988

the where, and the why.

So who:

28:47.827 --> 28:49.862
Hugo Boss Hemsworth.

28:49.962 --> 28:53.199
What: he is a celebrated
ER surgeon

28:53.299 --> 28:55.701
who is madly in love
with Zoey Brooks.

28:55.802 --> 28:57.169
When: present day.

28:57.269 --> 28:59.772
Where: born in Melbourne.

28:59.872 --> 29:01.707
Raised in West Philly.

29:02.909 --> 29:04.643
You really took
some liberties there.

29:04.743 --> 29:06.345
I just can't crack the why.

29:06.445 --> 29:09.515
You know, my interpretation
is that he's being used

29:09.615 --> 29:12.251
as a tool to make
your ex-boyfriend jealous.

29:12.351 --> 29:13.685
-Is that right?
-Jealous?

29:13.786 --> 29:15.754
No, no, no, absolutely not.

29:16.155 --> 29:17.489
That would be immature.

29:17.589 --> 29:20.459
I just want to show him
and everyone

29:20.559 --> 29:23.963
that I am a very successful,
well-rounded adult

29:24.063 --> 29:28.267
who's moved on and is doing
better than him.

29:28.367 --> 29:29.501

29:55.461 --> 29:56.963
I don't know what to tell you,
Chauncy,

29:57.063 --> 29:58.530
he's just not shucking
fast enough.

29:58.630 --> 30:01.067
Get me another shucker.
No, no, no, get me two.

30:01.167 --> 30:03.269

30:03.669 --> 30:05.171

-I've been looking for you.
-I'm sorry, babe.

30:12.211 --> 30:13.512
I've been putting out fires
left and right.

30:13.612 --> 30:15.047
Isn't that what
the wedding planner's for?

30:15.147 --> 30:17.449
-Yeah, I fired her.
-You what?

30:17.549 --> 30:19.551
Look, she just-- She wasn't
executing the vision.

30:19.651 --> 30:20.953
I thought this weekend
was supposed to be

30:21.053 --> 30:22.088
relaxed and intimate.

30:22.188 --> 30:24.456
250 people is intimate, babe.

30:24.556 --> 30:26.225
Do you know how many
people I didn't invite?

30:26.792 --> 30:28.861
-It's just all a little much.
-A little much?

30:28.961 --> 30:30.262
We got two life-sized cakes

30:30.362 --> 30:31.898

30:35.101 --> 30:37.636

all right?

30:37.736 --> 30:39.205
You work so hard,

30:39.305 --> 30:41.307
you deserve more
than a little much.

30:41.407 --> 30:43.375
You deserve the most much.

30:43.475 --> 30:44.944
I just want to give that to you.

You look amazing!

-These are cakes!

30:52.251 --> 30:54.086
Oh, wait, what?
This is a cake?

30:54.186 --> 30:55.487
-Yes.
-Damn!

30:55.587 --> 30:57.756
Could somebody get
these human cakes out of here,

Oh, speaking of the ceremony,

31:15.374 --> 31:17.309
I want to go over
what I have so far.

31:17.409 --> 31:18.744
I got, like, five drafts.

Mind calling me Hugo?

It just helps me
stay in character.

my moment before.

You almost hit us
with your car!

32:16.735 --> 32:19.371
It's called making an entrance,
Logan.

32:20.606 --> 32:22.841
All right. I'll accept that.

32:23.275 --> 32:25.277
That's a pretty good entrance.

-What's up, Zoey?
-Michael, it's been too long.

32:28.214 --> 32:30.849
Yeah, no shit, we live in the
same city and we barely see you.

who you are.

about you.

in the right direction?

in the guest quarters upstairs.

37:54.005 --> 37:55.941
Perhaps you'd care
to explain...

37:57.343 --> 37:58.610
-this.
-[Zoey gasps]

37:58.710 --> 38:00.779
The thing I love most
about Jordyn J.

38:00.879 --> 38:04.115
is probably her boobs.

38:04.215 --> 38:07.185
Oh, my God. The hair...

38:08.354 --> 38:11.022
looks so...

38:12.458 --> 38:13.392
good.

38:13.492 --> 38:15.461
So you knew about this

38:15.561 --> 38:16.728
and you let it happen?

38:16.828 --> 38:19.765
Because the hair?
That was it.

38:19.865 --> 38:21.333
That was all that he had.

38:21.433 --> 38:22.701
That's exactly why.

38:22.801 --> 38:25.737
He wanted to show Jordyn J.
and America

38:25.837 --> 38:28.374
that he's more
than just his hair.

38:28.474 --> 38:30.141
Uh, he's a trendsetter.

38:30.241 --> 38:31.943
It's called strategy.

38:32.043 --> 38:33.178
Is it?

38:33.278 --> 38:37.616
Kelley, being your first
and only female producer,

38:37.716 --> 38:39.351
you just got to trust me
on this.

38:39.451 --> 38:42.588
I know what our audience wants
because I am our audience.

38:42.688 --> 38:46.992
And I love the hair.

38:49.327 --> 38:50.496
For your own sake,

38:50.596 --> 38:53.599
I hope that you are right.

38:54.600 --> 38:55.867
[Zoey] Okay.

38:56.635 --> 38:57.869
[Kelley] Zoey?

38:58.404 --> 38:59.671
Seriously.

39:00.305 --> 39:01.272
Hot dress.

39:01.373 --> 39:02.741
-Oh.
-[Kelley] Yeah.

39:03.542 --> 39:04.643
Now I take you seriously.

39:04.743 --> 39:06.845
Okay. Thanks.

39:06.945 --> 39:08.179
Greg!

39:09.247 --> 39:10.582
Punch you in the face.

39:11.316 --> 39:14.219
[Todd] Just pumping away,
trying to get a pulse.

39:14.319 --> 39:16.822
Seven-year-old kid
swallowed a ping-pong ball.

39:16.922 --> 39:18.089
[gasps]

39:18.590 --> 39:20.492
-So sad.
-Oh, my God.

39:20.592 --> 39:21.660
No, no, no. Don't worry.

39:21.760 --> 39:23.061
He is fine.

39:23.161 --> 39:24.830
[all laugh]

39:24.930 --> 39:27.298
Nobody has ever died
on my table.

39:27.399 --> 39:28.333
Aw!

39:28.434 --> 39:30.201
Except maybe a couple times.

39:30.301 --> 39:32.203
[laughter]

39:32.303 --> 39:33.539
Who even is this guy?

39:33.639 --> 39:35.774
Shh. He's so sweet.

39:35.874 --> 39:37.643
You know what?
Enough about me.

39:37.743 --> 39:40.546
Stacey, I'm a huge fan
of the pod.

39:40.646 --> 39:41.813
Total Slaughter-head.

39:41.913 --> 39:43.415
-Oh!
-[Todd] Yeah.

39:43.515 --> 39:45.451
Any updates
on the Malibu Murderer?

39:45.551 --> 39:48.420
Oh. Um... you listen?

39:48.520 --> 39:49.755
Ahem. I'm back.

39:49.855 --> 39:52.691
This is Mark, my field producer.

39:52.791 --> 39:53.959
-Husband.
-Uh-huh.

39:54.059 --> 39:55.827
But, yes, also field producer.

39:55.927 --> 39:57.262
Didn't you and Quinn
used to...?

39:57.362 --> 39:58.797
Date. Yes.

39:58.897 --> 40:00.599
Yeah, it was just a fling.

40:00.699 --> 40:02.100
But this, uh...

40:02.868 --> 40:04.570
-This is the real deal.
-Excuse me.

40:04.670 --> 40:06.004
How was it with the witness?

40:06.104 --> 40:08.406
-I got a description...
-Yes, Mark. Great work.

40:08.507 --> 40:09.541
...of his hands.

40:09.641 --> 40:11.009
Damn it, Mark,
that's not enough.

40:11.109 --> 40:11.943
But go on.

40:12.043 --> 40:14.746
She said the hands
were large.

40:16.582 --> 40:17.549
That's it?

40:17.649 --> 40:19.050
[Todd] Not guilty!

40:19.150 --> 40:20.486
[all laugh]

40:21.152 --> 40:23.188
-[woman] They're enormous.
-[Danielle] Oh, so funny!

40:23.288 --> 40:26.257
[Zoey] Jordan B.,
why is your hair orange?

40:26.357 --> 40:28.426
I thought I could fix it
without anyone noticing.

40:28.527 --> 40:30.128
Fix what?

40:31.963 --> 40:34.099
I found a gray hair, okay?

40:34.199 --> 40:35.400
You happy?

40:35.501 --> 40:37.836
I can't have gray hair at 23.
I'm supposed to be hot.

40:37.936 --> 40:40.105
You bleached your whole head
because of one gray hair?

40:40.205 --> 40:42.173
Then it kind of started
falling out, so I had to cut it.

40:42.273 --> 40:44.510
I tried to find you first,
but you weren't here.

40:44.610 --> 40:45.944
I'm sorry. I know.

40:46.044 --> 40:47.946
-It's just...
-[cell phone chimes]

40:48.714 --> 40:50.482
Hang on. One second.

40:52.751 --> 40:54.085
Um...

40:55.120 --> 40:56.788
-I'm gonna have to leave again.
-What?

40:56.888 --> 40:59.491
If you need anything at all,
you call me.

40:59.591 --> 41:01.760
Not Kelley, okay? Me.

41:01.860 --> 41:03.394
You're gonna be fine.

41:07.432 --> 41:08.934
What was I saying?

41:09.034 --> 41:10.468
Oh, yeah. Jordyn's boobs.

41:11.336 --> 41:14.005
[funky, upbeat music playing]

41:15.340 --> 41:17.408
[breathing heavily]

41:18.209 --> 41:21.246
Om...

41:21.346 --> 41:22.480
* Cha cha *

41:23.949 --> 41:26.184
* Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da *

41:27.452 --> 41:28.520
[sighs]

41:28.620 --> 41:29.855
* If you wanna have some fun *

41:29.955 --> 41:31.857
* Come with me
I'll give you some *

41:31.957 --> 41:33.759
* Get back, get back *

41:33.859 --> 41:36.862
[Todd] So, in a way,
I credit Zoey

41:36.962 --> 41:38.630
for saving
that little boy's life.

41:38.730 --> 41:40.398
-[all] Aw!
-[Todd] Yeah, she...

41:41.132 --> 41:42.701
-[woman] So sweet.
-[Todd] Oh, my God.

41:42.801 --> 41:44.570
She inspires me
to be a better surgeon.

41:44.670 --> 41:47.138
-[all] Aw!
-Wow.

41:47.238 --> 41:49.575
Can you take a look at my feet?
Because--

41:49.675 --> 41:50.742
[all yell]

41:50.842 --> 41:52.477
-Whoa!
-What is that?!

41:52.578 --> 41:53.879
[Mark] I'm sorry, it stinks.

41:53.979 --> 41:55.647
[Michael]
Don't smell it. Just fix it.

41:55.747 --> 41:57.148
Quinn?

41:57.783 --> 41:59.484
Quinn?

41:59.585 --> 42:01.386
[cell phone vibrates]

42:03.354 --> 42:05.924
-Jordan B., what do you want?
-[Jordan B.] Zoey. [cries]

42:06.024 --> 42:08.827
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Don't cry. Don't cry.

42:09.795 --> 42:11.162
It's gonna--
It's gonna be okay.

42:11.697 --> 42:14.866
No! A neck tattoo will not fix
what you did to your hair.

42:14.966 --> 42:16.935
[Quinn]
Who's getting a neck tattoo?

42:18.303 --> 42:19.905
I-I have to go.

42:20.772 --> 42:23.041
Quinn, I've been looking
all over for you.

42:23.141 --> 42:25.376
What are you doing
in the bathtub?

42:25.476 --> 42:26.978
I'm unclogging the drain.

42:27.078 --> 42:29.347
Did you know clogged drains can
lead to corrosion and flooding?

42:29.815 --> 42:30.916
Oh no.

42:31.683 --> 42:33.852
Okay, what's wrong?

42:35.186 --> 42:38.690
I never dreamed
of having a wedding.

42:39.591 --> 42:41.827
But then I fell in love
with someone who did.

42:42.393 --> 42:46.064
And I want to do this for him,
but it's all a lot.

42:46.632 --> 42:48.299
Does Logan know that?

42:48.399 --> 42:50.869
We've been together
over a decade. You'd think so.

42:51.569 --> 42:52.771
But he's so totally absorbed,

42:52.871 --> 42:54.239
it's like
he's a different person.

42:54.339 --> 42:56.642
I know he's dreamed of having
an extravagant wedding,

42:56.742 --> 42:58.409
and I'm trying
to be sensitive to that.

42:58.509 --> 43:01.747
But I'm not a rational function.
My limits are not infinite.

43:01.847 --> 43:03.581
If only humans
could have vertical asymptotes,

43:03.682 --> 43:04.916
you know what I'm saying?

43:06.251 --> 43:08.119
Not at all.

43:08.654 --> 43:10.588
But I think I get
the gist of it.

43:11.757 --> 43:13.424
So why don't we just
get out of here.

43:13.524 --> 43:15.426
Leave my own party?

43:15.526 --> 43:17.195
I don't think I'm allowed
to do that.

43:17.295 --> 43:19.564
You're the bride.
You can do whatever you want.

43:20.666 --> 43:22.033
Party's almost over.

43:22.133 --> 43:23.201
Plus, there's a cake down there

43:23.301 --> 43:25.036
that everyone thinks
is you anyway.

43:25.570 --> 43:26.604
[laughs]

43:27.405 --> 43:30.141
-Where would we even go?
-I have ideas.

43:30.241 --> 43:32.410
-[muted club music playing]
-Seriously?

43:32.510 --> 43:33.745
A karaoke bar?

43:33.845 --> 43:35.947
No, no, no, no. It's late.

43:36.047 --> 43:37.749
The rehearsal's tomorrow.

43:37.849 --> 43:40.185
-We gotta be rested.
-[Quinn] Hey!

43:40.752 --> 43:41.920
Look at me.

43:42.020 --> 43:43.388
I love you.

43:44.389 --> 43:45.891
I love you too.

43:45.991 --> 43:47.993
So stop thinking about
the wedding for one second

43:48.093 --> 43:50.428
and have some fun with me,
okay?

43:51.763 --> 43:52.630
[sighs]

43:52.731 --> 43:53.799
Fine.

43:53.899 --> 43:55.300
-Okay. All right.
-[all] Yeah!

43:55.400 --> 43:57.568
But if Michael doesn't sing
Limp Bizkit, I'm leaving.

43:57.669 --> 44:00.338
Cool. Everyone's drinks
are on Logan. Let's go inside.

44:00.438 --> 44:02.607
-[all cheer]
-Let's go. Come on, babe.

44:02.708 --> 44:04.475
-[Michael] That's it, Logan.
-[Stacey] Let's do this.

44:04.910 --> 44:06.111
-You good?
-I'm good. You good?

44:06.211 --> 44:07.578
-Yeah. Great.
-Good.

44:07.679 --> 44:09.147
[Michael yelling]

* Gonna F you up,

44:59.230 --> 45:00.665
* You can't mess
with Limp Bizkit *

45:00.766 --> 45:02.934
* 'Cause we get it on
every day and every night *

45:03.034 --> 45:04.635
Was he always that talented?

45:04.736 --> 45:08.539
Yeah, but in school
it was mostly sad flute music.

45:08.639 --> 45:09.941
Oh, yes!

45:10.041 --> 45:12.778
So you all went
to high school together?

45:12.878 --> 45:14.479
Yeah! PCA, baby!

45:14.579 --> 45:16.481
So sad what happened.

45:17.315 --> 45:20.852
We were the last class
to attend Pacific Coast Academy.

45:20.952 --> 45:23.855
The school closed down in 2009

45:23.955 --> 45:27.525
when multiple parents complained
about poor education standards,

45:27.625 --> 45:30.295
leading the state to launch
a formal investigation,

45:30.395 --> 45:33.198
only to discover the school
wasn't even accredited

45:33.298 --> 45:35.633
and Dean Rivers was stealing
students' tuition

45:35.733 --> 45:38.236
and blowing it
at Morongo Casino and Resort.

45:38.336 --> 45:40.605
Yeah, it wasn't even
a real school.

45:40.705 --> 45:43.174
The student loans were real! Ha!

45:43.274 --> 45:45.710
[laughing]
I have so much debt!

-Woo!

45:54.552 --> 45:57.322
-Let's go!
-Great job, buddy. Great job.

45:57.422 --> 45:59.657
-Let's do it.
-[Logan] That was awesome!

45:59.757 --> 46:01.692
[indistinct shouting]

46:01.793 --> 46:04.830
I'm gonna hit the head.
Does anybody need anything?

46:04.930 --> 46:07.232
Chase? Maybe a water?

46:07.332 --> 46:08.900
Yes.

46:09.000 --> 46:10.601
All right, I'll be right back.

46:11.169 --> 46:13.504
-Consent to a kiss?
-Granted.

46:21.579 --> 46:24.916
All right, next up,
we have Hugo Hemsworth

46:25.016 --> 46:27.618
and Chase Matthews

46:27.718 --> 46:28.786
singing a duet.

46:28.887 --> 46:30.455
No, I'm all set.

46:31.489 --> 46:33.925
Babe, you love karaoke. Go!

46:34.025 --> 46:35.726
[cheers and applause]

46:37.362 --> 46:40.298
[all chanting]
Chase! Chase! Chase! Chase!

46:40.932 --> 46:42.067
-Yes!
-Woo!

46:42.167 --> 46:43.568
[Stacey]
Yes, Chase!

46:43.668 --> 46:44.569
Go, Chase, go!

46:44.669 --> 46:45.871
Hope you're cool
with the high part.

46:45.971 --> 46:46.938
Uh, what song are we even--

46:47.038 --> 46:50.675
* Now I've had *

46:50.775 --> 46:53.244
* The time of my life *

46:53.344 --> 46:56.347
* No, I never felt
like this before *

46:56.447 --> 46:58.216
Damn it, I love this song.

46:58.316 --> 46:59.985
* Yes, I swear *

47:00.085 --> 47:02.087
* It's the truth *

47:02.187 --> 47:04.956
* And I owe it all to you *

47:05.056 --> 47:08.459
* 'Cause I've had *

47:08.559 --> 47:11.096
* The time of my life *

47:11.196 --> 47:14.933
* And I owe it all to you *

47:15.366 --> 47:17.302
-Yo, they're both...
-Pretty good!

47:17.402 --> 47:19.037
-Yeah.
-Let's go, Chase!

47:19.137 --> 47:20.471
Not bad.

47:20.571 --> 47:22.473
Bet you didn't know
I was a high tenor, did you?

47:22.573 --> 47:24.442
* I've been waiting
for so long *

47:24.542 --> 47:27.078
* Now I finally
found someone *

47:27.178 --> 47:29.547
* To stand by me *

47:31.116 --> 47:33.618
* We saw the writing
on the wall *

47:33.718 --> 47:37.889
* As we felt
this magical fantasy *

47:39.790 --> 47:42.393
* Now with passion
in our eyes *

47:42.493 --> 47:46.631
* There's no way
we could disguise it secretly *

47:49.267 --> 47:50.902
* So we take
each others' hand *

47:51.002 --> 47:56.474
* 'Cause we seem to understand
the urgency *

47:57.408 --> 47:59.710
[tender, upbeat music playing]

48:04.115 --> 48:05.816
-Are they...?
-Wasted?

48:05.917 --> 48:07.518
One of them is.

48:07.986 --> 48:10.388
* I've had *

48:10.488 --> 48:12.690
* The time of my life *

48:12.790 --> 48:17.162
* No, I never felt
this way before *

48:17.262 --> 48:19.364
* Yes, I swear *

48:19.464 --> 48:22.200
* It's the truth *

48:22.300 --> 48:26.437
* And I owe it all to you *

48:26.537 --> 48:27.838
[cheering]

48:27.939 --> 48:29.374
[Michael] See that bod?

48:33.811 --> 48:35.113
Yes!

48:35.213 --> 48:36.481
[Mark] Calm down.

48:47.292 --> 48:49.194
[cheering]

48:49.860 --> 48:51.196
Yes!

48:53.431 --> 48:55.766
I can't dance like that.
I can't dance like that.

48:55.866 --> 48:57.935
No, come on! Come on!

48:58.036 --> 48:59.704
Oh, whoa, whoa.
Are you okay?

48:59.804 --> 49:01.172
I am so sorry, dude.

49:01.272 --> 49:02.507
What is this?

49:02.607 --> 49:04.175
What? I thought we were
just having fun.

49:04.275 --> 49:05.710
This is about Zoey, isn't it?

49:05.810 --> 49:07.878
You're mad we dated so you're
trying to make me jealous.

49:07.979 --> 49:10.248
Well, that's not gonna work,
Mr. Sexy Doctor Man,

49:10.348 --> 49:12.250
because I don't care
about Zoey anymore.

49:12.350 --> 49:14.585
-What's happening?
-Looks like they're fighting.

49:14.685 --> 49:16.254
[inaudible]

49:17.388 --> 49:18.556
Let's just chill out.

49:18.656 --> 49:20.958
That's it. I'm over it!
I'm over her!

49:22.393 --> 49:24.795
-Well, doesn't sound like it.
-What'd you say?

49:24.895 --> 49:26.431
I just get the feeling

49:26.531 --> 49:29.234
that maybe you're not
actually over her.

49:32.137 --> 49:33.571
-[screams]
-[all gasp]

49:34.705 --> 49:36.274
[all cheer]

49:38.876 --> 49:40.445
[laughing]

49:41.412 --> 49:43.281
You're getting a bit heavy.

49:44.549 --> 49:46.484
-Ah!
-[all gasp]

49:48.919 --> 49:50.888
-[Mark] What?
-Up! Up!

49:50.988 --> 49:52.190
What is your problem?

49:52.290 --> 49:55.293
Oh, boo-hoo! Time for rehearsal!

49:55.393 --> 49:56.761
Out of bed!

49:59.197 --> 50:01.032
Everybody outside in ten!

50:01.132 --> 50:03.234
[Stacey]
What is the matter with you?

50:03.334 --> 50:05.803
[both continue shouting
indistinctly]

50:10.308 --> 50:12.610
Can't he leave me alone
for one minute?

50:12.710 --> 50:14.312
I'm so sick
of babysitting this guy.

50:14.412 --> 50:15.846
I cannot do this today.

50:15.946 --> 50:16.981
[sighs]

50:21.219 --> 50:23.054
-Todd.
-Hmm?

50:23.154 --> 50:24.522
Aren't you a manny?

50:25.323 --> 50:27.458
It's a side gig, but yeah.

50:28.859 --> 50:30.761
-Hmm?
-No!

50:31.196 --> 50:33.398
-[whimpers]
-[sighs]

50:33.498 --> 50:36.467
No. I'm your fake boyfriend.

50:37.868 --> 50:39.170
Fake hungover boyfriend.

50:39.270 --> 50:40.871
I'm not your babysitter.

50:41.472 --> 50:42.440
Please. Please.

50:42.540 --> 50:44.041
[Logan]
Meet me in the chapel in ten!

50:44.142 --> 50:46.844
I have to go be with my friends.
I really need your help on this.

50:46.944 --> 50:47.912
Please.

50:48.012 --> 50:49.514
The villa is just
right up the street.

50:49.614 --> 50:51.882
You can go up there,
distract him, have fun.

50:51.982 --> 50:55.019
-Please, please, please?
-Wait, so I get to go to set?

50:55.120 --> 50:56.854
Yes. Thank you.

50:59.290 --> 51:01.626
Oh, my God. Finally.

51:02.393 --> 51:04.395
[Logan]
Places! Okay.

51:04.495 --> 51:06.331
So we're gonna start
with Michael

51:06.431 --> 51:09.367
making an announcement
to ask all the guests

51:09.467 --> 51:11.769
to silence their phones.

51:12.337 --> 51:13.604
Cue Michael.

51:14.772 --> 51:16.006
[wheezes]

51:16.507 --> 51:17.908
[Michael gasps weakly]

51:20.178 --> 51:21.579
Cue Michael.

51:22.513 --> 51:24.182
[wheezing]
Silence your phone.

51:24.282 --> 51:25.450
Bro, what is going on?

51:25.550 --> 51:27.752
[Lyric]
"I think I lost my voice."

51:28.453 --> 51:30.087
How do you know
what he's saying?

51:30.188 --> 51:31.922
I'm really good at lip-reading.

51:32.022 --> 51:33.224
From over there?

51:33.324 --> 51:34.792
-Plus, I have 20/20 vision.
-[Logan] Great.

51:34.892 --> 51:37.495
So my officiant
has lost his voice

51:37.595 --> 51:39.497
the day before the wedding!

51:40.431 --> 51:42.333
This is why we can't have fun.

51:42.933 --> 51:44.835
[Lyric]
"Let me show you. Ready?"

51:44.935 --> 51:47.538
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here today

51:47.638 --> 51:50.107
to celebrate this thing
called patriarchy.

51:51.242 --> 51:52.577
Heard of it?

51:52.943 --> 51:55.313
Which has been used
for centuries to oppress women

51:55.413 --> 51:56.881
by buying and selling them.

51:56.981 --> 51:59.417
It's also kept the majority of
wealth in the male minority.

51:59.517 --> 52:00.851
[Logan]
Okay, thank you, Lyric.

52:00.951 --> 52:03.788
Look, I'm sorry, buddy,
but I gotta replace you.

52:03.888 --> 52:05.856
-[Lyric] "Son of a--"
-Fine.

52:06.357 --> 52:07.925
-I'll do it.
-What?

52:08.025 --> 52:11.562
I have the number one
murder podcast in the U.S.

52:11.662 --> 52:13.398
People would literally kill

52:13.498 --> 52:14.965
to have me officiate
their wedding.

52:15.065 --> 52:16.601
Yeah, you make a fair point.

52:16.701 --> 52:18.002
But who's gonna
walk me down the aisle?

52:18.102 --> 52:21.239
-It's a straight line, babe.
-Michael, obviously.

52:21.672 --> 52:23.308
[Lyric]
"Okay, sounds good."

52:23.408 --> 52:24.742
[Logan]
Let's try this again.

52:24.842 --> 52:28.513
Stacey will ask everyone
to silence their phones.

52:28.613 --> 52:30.315
Get out of here, buddy.

52:30.415 --> 52:32.683
-[clears throat]
-Cue Stacey.

52:33.918 --> 52:37.722
[in deep, booming voice]
Silence your phones!

52:38.856 --> 52:40.791
Just a little less creepy
next time, okay?

52:40.891 --> 52:43.461
Yeah, okay.
Lyric's gonna sing us in.

52:45.296 --> 52:46.964
Lyric!

52:49.334 --> 52:50.535
[device chimes]

52:50.635 --> 52:52.537
[vocalizes notes, stops]

52:53.471 --> 52:55.440
[vocalizes notes, stops]

52:55.906 --> 52:58.175
My AI gloves weren't programmed
to deal with that reverb.

52:58.276 --> 52:59.610
Did you hear the echo?

52:59.710 --> 53:01.646
-[vocalizing]
-[distorted audio]

53:01.746 --> 53:03.514
All right, guys, get in places.

53:03.614 --> 53:05.816
Michael, Mark,
Camille and Jared, come on.

53:05.916 --> 53:07.485
-Tighten up.
-How's your nose?

53:07.585 --> 53:08.886
How do you think?

53:08.986 --> 53:11.356
Your boyfriend dropped me
on my face on purpose.

53:11.456 --> 53:13.358
He did not do it on purpose.

53:13.458 --> 53:16.193
Zoey, he's very strong.
His muscles are huge.

53:16.294 --> 53:17.528
He definitely
could have held me.

53:17.628 --> 53:20.097
Classic Chase.
Taking everything so personally.

53:20.197 --> 53:21.832
He said he was sorry.

53:23.401 --> 53:25.169
[Logan] All right,
cue Camille and Jared.

53:25.270 --> 53:27.738
Chase, I know it's awkward,
but for the sake of our friends,

53:27.838 --> 53:29.907
can't we at least just try
to be friends?

53:30.007 --> 53:31.108
[sighs]

53:31.208 --> 53:32.743
I'm sorry, but after
everything that happened,

53:32.843 --> 53:34.445
did you really think
we were gonna be able

53:34.545 --> 53:36.080
to just link arms
and stroll off into the sunset?

53:36.180 --> 53:39.216
All right, now Zoey and Chase
will link arms and stroll.

53:39.317 --> 53:41.085
Okay, the timing of that
was unfair.

53:41.185 --> 53:44.121
[Logan] They're linking.
They're strolling.

53:46.190 --> 53:47.758
You could look happy.

53:48.659 --> 53:50.094
Okay, cue the bride.

53:51.262 --> 53:53.831
[Chase] And, frankly, there is
no amount of philanthropy

53:53.931 --> 53:55.533
that will ever make up
for those mistakes.

53:55.633 --> 53:57.402
-[laughter]
-Lastly,

53:57.502 --> 53:58.936
Quinn, you have come up

53:59.036 --> 54:01.572
with so many wonderful
inventions over the years,

54:01.672 --> 54:03.608
but I think
that your most impressive yet

54:03.708 --> 54:05.876
is actually the reinvention

54:05.976 --> 54:08.112
of this guy right here,
my best friend.

54:08.212 --> 54:10.515
He's become an amazing man
because of you.

54:10.615 --> 54:12.883
And so I think I speak
for all of us

54:12.983 --> 54:15.520
when I say thank you very much,
Quinn.

54:15.620 --> 54:17.788
-[all laugh]
-To Quinn and Logan. Everyone.

54:17.888 --> 54:19.857
[all] To Quinn and Logan!

54:19.957 --> 54:21.158
[glasses clink]

54:23.461 --> 54:25.596
This is nice.
Stace, isn't this nice?

54:25.696 --> 54:27.197
Everyone together,
celebrating?

54:27.298 --> 54:30.968
Mm-hmm. Mark, tell me something.
You're my field producer, right?

54:31.068 --> 54:32.269
And husband.

54:32.370 --> 54:34.505
Then why aren't you
in the field?

54:34.605 --> 54:36.607
I thought we'd take
the night off.

54:36.707 --> 54:38.509
Can the women
who are being murdered

54:38.609 --> 54:39.977
take the night off, Mark?

54:40.077 --> 54:41.111
But...

54:42.246 --> 54:43.280
couldn't he be here?

54:44.114 --> 54:45.149
-What?
-I'm just saying,

54:45.249 --> 54:47.385
technically couldn't
the Malibu Murderer

54:47.752 --> 54:49.253
be at this wedding

54:49.354 --> 54:50.755
in Malibu?

54:52.256 --> 54:53.458
How dare you, Mark?

54:53.558 --> 54:55.292
These are our closest
and dearest friends.

54:55.393 --> 54:57.762
-You're so right.
-Why would there be a murderer

54:57.862 --> 54:59.597
-at this wedding?
-Just forget I said it.

54:59.697 --> 55:00.998
Enjoy your fish.

55:04.669 --> 55:06.303
-Where's Hugo?
-Oh.

55:06.404 --> 55:07.705
Um, uh...

55:08.673 --> 55:10.207
he got called in
for an emergency.

55:10.307 --> 55:12.377
If only there were more
people like him in the world.

55:13.010 --> 55:15.813
Hey, Zoe, your turn.
Like yesterday.

55:15.913 --> 55:17.648
Oh, right. Yeah, okay.

55:18.248 --> 55:19.350
[glass clinking]

55:19.450 --> 55:23.253
I would like to make a toast.

55:24.088 --> 55:28.626
I've known Quinn and Logan
for more than half my life.

55:29.193 --> 55:31.962
During that time,
I've watched Quinn grow,

55:32.062 --> 55:36.501
evolve, and accomplish
almost all of her dreams.

55:37.034 --> 55:39.103
And I've watched Logan
watch her do that.

55:39.203 --> 55:40.605
[all laugh]

55:41.005 --> 55:45.109
Everyone says that high school
love doesn't last,

55:45.209 --> 55:46.977
and they're right.

55:47.077 --> 55:49.847
Most of the time, it doesn't.

55:50.581 --> 55:52.717
Against all odds,

55:52.817 --> 55:55.252
Quinn and Logan
have proved them wrong.

55:57.388 --> 55:59.289
Uh... um...

55:59.390 --> 56:03.093
uh, that's why it's so real

56:03.193 --> 56:05.463
and inspiring.

56:05.563 --> 56:07.798
Just really makes me,

56:07.898 --> 56:11.436
you know, just dance a little
and, um...

56:12.102 --> 56:14.672
[bangs on table]
...just really gets me

56:14.772 --> 56:18.208
so excited, I just want
to sing and drink a lot.

56:18.308 --> 56:19.844
-[all cheer]
-Yeah!

56:19.944 --> 56:22.012
To Quinn and Logan!

56:22.112 --> 56:24.415
-[excited chatter]
-[glasses clink]

56:25.483 --> 56:26.751
[all gasp]

56:26.851 --> 56:29.654
I'm such a klutz.
I'm gonna have to go change.

56:29.754 --> 56:31.188
You missed your mouth
by a lot.

56:31.288 --> 56:33.190
I know. I'm sorry.
I'll be right back, okay?

56:36.360 --> 56:37.628
What is going on?

56:37.728 --> 56:39.764
Why is he here?
And what is on his face?

56:39.864 --> 56:42.767
I'm an ice tiger. Grr!

56:43.468 --> 56:44.735
Todd, what happened?

56:44.835 --> 56:46.504
[in normal voice]
You told me to babysit.

56:46.604 --> 56:47.938
So I took him to the pier.

56:48.038 --> 56:50.441
He wanted to ride
the kiddy coaster, right?

56:50.541 --> 56:53.410
But he's too big, so he hit
his head on the support beam.

56:55.379 --> 56:58.148
Now he can't remember
the last six months of his life.

56:58.248 --> 57:01.586
Including the show,
or Jordyn J.

57:01.686 --> 57:03.420
-What?
-[roars loudly]

57:03.521 --> 57:05.389
-[roaring]
-My God.

57:05.490 --> 57:06.791
Did I just hear a lion?

57:06.891 --> 57:10.060
No. My dad made me get rid
of all my exotic pets.

57:10.160 --> 57:12.262
[Todd]
It's not that big of a deal.

57:12.362 --> 57:13.698
Right? It's okay.

57:13.798 --> 57:16.901
I mean, wasn't Jordan B.
pretty stupid already?

57:17.367 --> 57:19.103
[roars]

57:20.270 --> 57:21.872
You're right, maybe nobody
will even notice.

57:21.972 --> 57:24.308
I mean, I'm gonna be telling him
exactly what to say.

57:24.742 --> 57:26.644
Okay, I need to get back
down there.

57:26.744 --> 57:28.178
So you're gonna sneak him
into the villa,

57:28.278 --> 57:29.747
put him to sleep,
he'll sleep this off,

57:29.847 --> 57:31.982
-and everything will be--

57:32.082 --> 57:33.317
Oh.

57:36.721 --> 57:38.022
[screams]

57:38.122 --> 57:40.424
[bright, upbeat music playing]

57:42.426 --> 57:44.061
[panting]

57:56.841 --> 57:58.743
[male voice]
Door opening.

58:04.549 --> 58:05.950
Door closing.

58:08.919 --> 58:10.320
Zoey, it is show day.

58:10.420 --> 58:12.389
You said you were gonna
have the car back in time,

58:12.489 --> 58:13.958
so where's the car, babe?

58:14.058 --> 58:15.125
Archer, I promise you,

58:15.225 --> 58:17.061
the car is the least
of your worries.

58:17.161 --> 58:20.865
Have you seen Jordan B. today?
Is he acting a little,

58:20.965 --> 58:23.000
um, I don't know, different?

58:24.168 --> 58:25.770
Oh, hey!

58:26.370 --> 58:28.105
-Hi.
-Hey!

58:28.205 --> 58:29.339
Whoa!

58:31.408 --> 58:33.077
[panicked chatter]

58:33.711 --> 58:35.680
Just as dumb as usual. Why?

58:35.780 --> 58:38.348
No reason! Look, I'm on my way
with the car.

58:38.448 --> 58:41.351
I just have to make a little
pit stop in Santa Barbara.

58:41.451 --> 58:44.254
Santa Barbara?
That is not on the way.

58:44.822 --> 58:46.190
Okay, um...

58:47.625 --> 58:49.259
What do I do?

58:50.094 --> 58:51.829
[heavy metal music blares]

58:51.929 --> 58:53.564

58:55.365 --> 58:57.501
[gasps] Oh, my God!
I'm so sorry! I did not mean to!

58:57.602 --> 58:59.203
-[groans]
-Oh, Chase.

58:59.303 --> 59:00.571
It's you.

59:00.671 --> 59:02.072
Zoey!

59:02.940 --> 59:05.175
If my nose wasn't broken before,
I think it might be now.

59:05.275 --> 59:06.944
Why are you even up this early?

59:07.044 --> 59:08.779
I went on a run.
Why are you even up right now?

59:08.879 --> 59:10.414
Is your nose bleeding?

59:10.514 --> 59:11.782
Oh, here, I have some tissues.

59:11.882 --> 59:13.117
[male voice]
Door closing.

59:13.217 --> 59:14.652
-Uh, no...
-Wait, no, no, no!

Wait, wait!

59:16.687 --> 59:18.288

Navigation calculated.

59:18.388 --> 59:21.592
Estimated time:
one hour, 12 minutes.

59:22.559 --> 59:24.494
Zoey? Turn it off.

59:24.595 --> 59:26.063
[Zoey] I don't know how.

59:26.163 --> 59:28.332
[Chase] You don't know
how to work your own car?

59:28.432 --> 59:30.434
-Come on.
-Turn off!

59:31.001 --> 59:33.237
-Door. Stop car.
-[Chase] Uh...

59:34.739 --> 59:36.140
[Zoey] Cancel trip.

59:36.240 --> 59:39.176
[male voice] New drive time:
one hour, 59 minutes.

59:39.276 --> 59:41.111
[Chase]
Why did it just go up?

59:41.211 --> 59:43.513
-Quinn?
-Here comes the bride.

59:43.614 --> 59:47.618
All dressed in really pretty
pink pajamas. Hello?

59:47.718 --> 59:49.754
-Wedding day!
-Good morning!

59:49.854 --> 59:53.090
-You all look so good!
-You do!

59:54.659 --> 59:55.860
Where's Zoey?

59:55.960 --> 59:57.561
-Oh.
-Zoey?

59:57.662 --> 59:58.696
Zoey?

59:58.796 --> 01:00:00.931
-Zoe?
-Zoey?

01:00:01.398 --> 01:00:02.633
-Zoey?
-Zoey?

01:00:12.542 --> 01:00:14.578
It's showtime, baby.

01:00:23.153 --> 01:00:25.289
Can you at least tell me
where we're going?

01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:34.031
Cool, I guess we'll just
sit in silence then.

01:00:35.299 --> 01:00:36.633
Chase, you made it very clear

01:00:36.734 --> 01:00:38.669
that you don't want to hear
what I have to say.

01:00:38.769 --> 01:00:40.170
I thought that maybe
this weekend,

01:00:40.270 --> 01:00:42.106
we could put our past
behind us and act like adults,

01:00:42.206 --> 01:00:43.841
but clearly we cannot.

01:00:43.941 --> 01:00:46.811
So, yes, I think it's best
if we don't speak.

01:00:46.911 --> 01:00:48.679
[male voice]
Playing "Don't Speak."

01:00:49.546 --> 01:00:51.782
* You and me *

01:00:52.449 --> 01:00:55.619
* We used to be together *

01:00:55.720 --> 01:00:58.655
* Every day, together *

01:00:58.756 --> 01:01:01.091
* Always *

01:01:02.159 --> 01:01:05.062
* I really feel *

01:01:05.162 --> 01:01:08.098
* That I'm losing
my best friend *

01:01:08.198 --> 01:01:13.370
* I can't believe
this could be the end *

01:01:14.271 --> 01:01:15.405
* Don't speak *

01:01:15.505 --> 01:01:18.208
* I know just what
you're saying *

01:01:18.308 --> 01:01:21.278
* So please stop explaining *

01:01:21.378 --> 01:01:23.280
* Don't tell me,
'cause it hurts *

[Todd, in Australian accent]
Ladies, are we decent?

01:01:25.382 --> 01:01:26.216
[laughs]

01:01:26.316 --> 01:01:28.585
Hugo, what are you
doing here?

01:01:28.685 --> 01:01:30.620
Zoey's dealing with a little
work emergency,

01:01:30.721 --> 01:01:32.857
-so she sent me.
-Wow.

01:01:32.957 --> 01:01:35.259
-Who wants mimosas?
-[excited chatter]

01:01:35.359 --> 01:01:36.493
[Todd] Yes!

01:01:36.593 --> 01:01:38.863
-Everybody take a glass.
-Is everything okay?

01:01:38.963 --> 01:01:40.831
[Todd] Here you go.
Everything is fine.

01:01:40.931 --> 01:01:43.633
-She's gonna be right back.
-Okay.

[whimsical music playing]

01:01:51.441 --> 01:01:54.611
[Chase] But Logan said
you got the rings already.

01:01:54.711 --> 01:01:55.746
Doors opening.

01:01:55.846 --> 01:01:57.782
Thank God.
Let's get out of here.

01:01:57.882 --> 01:02:00.117
This thing's horrible.
It's like a prison on wheels.

01:02:00.217 --> 01:02:03.220
Doors closing.
Self-park activating.

01:02:04.021 --> 01:02:06.023
Oh. Heh.

01:02:07.691 --> 01:02:10.527
Hey, is that the car
from LOVE: Fully Charged ?

01:02:11.295 --> 01:02:12.062
No.

01:02:12.162 --> 01:02:13.663
I'm pretty sure it is.

01:02:13.764 --> 01:02:15.032
No, it's not.

01:02:21.738 --> 01:02:23.040
[woman]
These are really nice.

01:02:23.140 --> 01:02:25.475
Even I would like for you
to buy me some of these.

01:02:25.575 --> 01:02:27.511
You know, if you want
somebody on the side,

01:02:27.611 --> 01:02:28.779
I am that person.

01:02:31.081 --> 01:02:32.482

01:02:32.582 --> 01:02:33.550
[gasps]

01:02:33.650 --> 01:02:34.718
We are appointment only.

01:02:34.819 --> 01:02:35.820
You have an appointment?

01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:37.822
Um, we're here to pick up.

01:02:37.922 --> 01:02:40.490
-Name?
-Reese. Logan and Quinn.

01:02:41.591 --> 01:02:42.860
Oh, Mr. and Mrs. Reese.

01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:45.662
Stop playing with me. You know
you got no money. Go home.

01:02:46.363 --> 01:02:50.034
Oh! Mr. and Mrs. Reese,
I did not recognize your voice.

01:02:50.134 --> 01:02:51.768
I spoke to y'all over the phone.

01:02:51.869 --> 01:02:53.237
Remember me? Janice.

01:02:53.337 --> 01:02:54.771
-No, that's actually not...
-No. We're not...

01:02:54.872 --> 01:02:57.141
Honestly, it's fine.
My mama say I'm forgettable.

01:02:57.241 --> 01:02:58.876
But you two are late.

01:02:58.976 --> 01:03:00.210
I thought maybe
you was trying to ditch us

01:03:00.310 --> 01:03:01.979
and get your rings
down the street.

01:03:02.079 --> 01:03:03.380
[both laugh nervously]

01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:04.915

The rings will be right out.

01:03:10.754 --> 01:03:11.721

Oh, this is a lot.

01:03:28.272 --> 01:03:29.773
-Uh, no.
-Uh, no. We're fine.

01:03:29.874 --> 01:03:31.775
-Take it.
-[whispering] Take it.

01:03:32.242 --> 01:03:34.111
-Okay.
-[both chuckle nervously]

01:03:34.211 --> 01:03:36.113
We love giving high-paying
customers like yourself

the full VIP treatment.

01:03:37.414 --> 01:03:38.648
We hope you don't mind.

01:03:38.748 --> 01:03:40.450
-We actually have to go.
-Yeah, we need to leave.

01:03:40.550 --> 01:03:43.988
Oh, come on, you're never gonna
be as in love as you are now.

01:03:44.088 --> 01:03:45.622
And it might not even last.

01:03:46.290 --> 01:03:48.058
-Probably won't.
-That's a weird thing to say.

01:03:48.158 --> 01:03:49.359
Okay. Oh!

-[camera shutters click]
-[all] Cheers!

01:03:53.130 --> 01:03:54.831
So, Quinn and Logan,
what's your story?

01:03:54.932 --> 01:03:57.101
-Again, we're actually not...
-We don't want to...

01:03:57.201 --> 01:04:00.304
Oh, come on, don't be
those people, so boring.

01:04:00.404 --> 01:04:02.306
Don't even think
about being those people.

01:04:02.772 --> 01:04:05.575
You're not gonna get these rings
until you spill the tea.

01:04:05.675 --> 01:04:07.177
Now, where did you meet?

01:04:08.345 --> 01:04:10.047
Well, we met in middle school.

01:04:10.147 --> 01:04:12.516
Oh, young love. I love.
Then what?

01:04:12.616 --> 01:04:15.819
He saw me and ran his bike
into a flagpole.

01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:17.321
-No. A flagpole?
-I'm dead.

01:04:17.421 --> 01:04:19.656
-Then we became best friends.
-Study buddies.

01:04:19.756 --> 01:04:21.558
But everybody knew
I had a thing for her.

01:04:21.658 --> 01:04:23.293
And no one knew
I had a thing for him.

01:04:23.393 --> 01:04:24.828
-They knew.
-They did not.

01:04:24.929 --> 01:04:26.964
But every time I tried
to take it to the next level,

01:04:27.064 --> 01:04:29.366
something always got in the way.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.768
-Other boyfriends.
-[all gasp]

01:04:31.868 --> 01:04:34.071
-Other girlfriends.
-Yikes. We don't like that.

01:04:34.171 --> 01:04:35.739
-Distance.
-Mm-hmm.

01:04:35.839 --> 01:04:37.274
-Mistakes.
-Ugh.

01:04:37.374 --> 01:04:39.009
But anyway, here we are
getting married now.

01:04:39.109 --> 01:04:40.677
It's great,
so fast-forward to now.

01:04:40.777 --> 01:04:41.578
We'd love our rings.

01:04:41.678 --> 01:04:43.147

Kiss. Kiss. Kiss.

01:04:43.247 --> 01:04:45.849

-Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

01:04:48.652 --> 01:04:50.820
-We're just gonna...
-Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

01:04:50.921 --> 01:04:55.392
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

01:04:55.492 --> 01:04:57.661
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

-[all cheer]

Guys, seriously?

01:05:02.699 --> 01:05:04.969
-We're actually gonna head.
-We should leave, right?

01:05:05.069 --> 01:05:06.736
This is a lot.
And the champagne was...

* I'm just waiting
for your love *

01:05:09.806 --> 01:05:12.209
* You know you are
the only one *

01:05:12.309 --> 01:05:13.643
* That I think of *

01:05:13.743 --> 01:05:17.147
* And all I want to do
is fuel the fire *

01:05:17.247 --> 01:05:18.648
[all]
Oh.

01:05:19.349 --> 01:05:21.618
-Seriously, these suck.
-Every single one.

01:05:21.718 --> 01:05:23.020
Blurry.

01:05:23.453 --> 01:05:26.256
No, actually,
Zoey's the big spoon

01:05:26.356 --> 01:05:27.757
and I'm the little spoon.

01:05:27.857 --> 01:05:29.026
We're cute like that.

01:05:29.126 --> 01:05:30.160

01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:31.928
Hugo, you are hilarious.

01:05:32.029 --> 01:05:33.297
Where did you grow up again?

01:05:33.397 --> 01:05:34.564
[in normal voice]
Burbank.

01:05:34.664 --> 01:05:36.266
[in Australian accent]
Uh... Brisbane.

01:05:38.602 --> 01:05:39.403
[laughs]

01:05:39.503 --> 01:05:40.904
Australia. Brisbane.

01:05:43.107 --> 01:05:45.675
[Lyric] Sometimes I use an
Australian accent when I go out.

01:05:45.775 --> 01:05:47.611
[in bad Australian accent]
You wouldn't believe

01:05:47.711 --> 01:05:51.748
how many men, women,
and nonbinary people I get

01:05:51.848 --> 01:05:53.217
when I use this voice.

01:05:53.317 --> 01:05:55.585
Hey, Hugo, could you text
Zoey for me?

01:05:55.685 --> 01:05:57.821
I've tried a bunch of times,
but she hasn't responded.

01:05:57.921 --> 01:05:59.323
Yeah, can do.

01:05:59.423 --> 01:06:01.725
I'll get us a bottle
while I'm out.

01:06:03.227 --> 01:06:04.561
[sighs]

01:06:06.396 --> 01:06:07.564
All right, see you soon.

01:06:07.664 --> 01:06:10.700
[in bad accent]
Ugh. Aussies are the best.

01:06:12.036 --> 01:06:14.471
[computerized voice]
Hey, Logan, here's an idea.

01:06:14.571 --> 01:06:16.306
I can still officiate
the wedding

01:06:16.406 --> 01:06:17.907
using text to voice.

01:06:18.008 --> 01:06:19.809
What? No, dude.
Absolutely not.

01:06:19.909 --> 01:06:22.146
Look, I can't find Chase
anywhere. Where is he?

01:06:22.246 --> 01:06:23.580
[wheezing]

01:06:24.448 --> 01:06:26.050
Dude, I can't hear
a single thing you're saying.

01:06:26.150 --> 01:06:27.117
Where is he?

01:06:27.217 --> 01:06:28.718
-I'll text him.
-I'll text him.

01:06:28.818 --> 01:06:29.886
Thank you, Jared.

01:06:32.289 --> 01:06:34.324
[computerized voice]
Jared, you suck.

01:06:34.924 --> 01:06:36.093
Really, Michael?

01:06:36.193 --> 01:06:38.162
[upbeat music playing]

01:06:38.262 --> 01:06:39.596
[Chase and Zoey laughing]

01:06:39.696 --> 01:06:41.265
[Chase] Is that what happens
when you get engaged?

01:06:41.365 --> 01:06:42.866
Free champagne
everywhere you go?

01:06:42.966 --> 01:06:44.401
[Zoey] No, that's what happens
when you drop

01:06:44.501 --> 01:06:46.670
-six figures on a ring.
-[laughs]

01:06:46.770 --> 01:06:49.039
So, um, you think you and Hugo
will get engaged?

01:06:49.139 --> 01:06:50.740
[laughing] No.

01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:52.909
I'm-I'm-- I mean, no.

01:06:53.910 --> 01:06:55.845
Not really thinking
about marriage.

01:06:55.945 --> 01:06:57.714
But what about you?

01:06:57.814 --> 01:06:59.849
Danielle? No.
I mean, she's great.

01:06:59.949 --> 01:07:01.785
Um, for now.

01:07:01.885 --> 01:07:04.321
Uh, you know,
the timing just felt right.

01:07:04.754 --> 01:07:06.856
Timing. Something we never had.

01:07:11.228 --> 01:07:13.630
[somber music playing]

01:07:14.598 --> 01:07:16.900
I'm so sorry about Hawaii.

01:07:17.534 --> 01:07:19.369
I tried to call.
I sent messages.

01:07:19.469 --> 01:07:21.538
And I completely understand
why you didn't respond,

01:07:21.638 --> 01:07:24.141
but I wanted the chance
to explain why I--

01:07:24.241 --> 01:07:27.043
Left me alone on a literal
island and waited weeks to call?

01:07:27.144 --> 01:07:28.778
Yeah, why did you do that?

01:07:31.215 --> 01:07:35.319
I guess I was so used to it
not working out between us

01:07:35.419 --> 01:07:38.555
that I was scared
of what would happen

01:07:38.655 --> 01:07:42.025
if it actually did.
So I just bailed.

01:07:43.327 --> 01:07:46.096
I really, really wish I hadn't.

01:07:46.863 --> 01:07:50.167
I mean, I've tried to move on.
I've tried to forget.

01:07:50.267 --> 01:07:51.868
I threw myself into work.

01:07:51.968 --> 01:07:54.371
Distanced myself
from all of our friends.

01:07:54.471 --> 01:07:56.706
I even downloaded
every dating app on Earth.

01:07:56.806 --> 01:07:59.676
But no matter what I did,
it always came back to you.

01:08:02.412 --> 01:08:05.382
I know that sounds
so ridiculous, but it's why...

01:08:05.482 --> 01:08:08.585
[music brightens, intensifies]

01:08:26.270 --> 01:08:28.071
-[alarm beeping]
-[music fades]

01:08:35.879 --> 01:08:37.814
[Chase]
Why is the car stopping?

01:08:38.415 --> 01:08:40.884
[male voice]
Zero percent charge.

01:08:42.386 --> 01:08:44.720
Oh, my gosh.
You have to charge this car.

01:08:44.821 --> 01:08:46.656
[Chase]
Yeah, that's kind of a thing.

01:08:46.756 --> 01:08:49.593
[dramatic orchestral music
playing]

01:08:52.229 --> 01:08:53.997
You look beautiful.

01:08:55.432 --> 01:08:56.966
Thank you.

01:08:59.102 --> 01:09:00.737
Is that what you're wearing?

01:09:00.837 --> 01:09:02.305
Yeah, why?

01:09:02.406 --> 01:09:03.740
No reason.

01:09:05.408 --> 01:09:06.776
-Anything yet from Zoey?
-No.

01:09:06.876 --> 01:09:08.778
Calls are going
straight to voicemail.

01:09:08.877 --> 01:09:09.946
Why is...

01:09:10.046 --> 01:09:11.648
...nothing going through?

01:09:13.350 --> 01:09:16.085
[Chase] Yeah, I think I had
better over here, actually.

01:09:16.185 --> 01:09:18.721
[Zoey] What am I gonna do?
How could this be the one spot

01:09:18.822 --> 01:09:20.557
that there's absolutely
no service?

01:09:21.258 --> 01:09:22.158
[cell phone beeping]

01:09:22.259 --> 01:09:23.960
Zoey, Zoey, hey, hey.

01:09:24.060 --> 01:09:25.595
I think we can make it,
but we have to go.

01:09:25.694 --> 01:09:27.197
We have to walk now.

01:09:27.997 --> 01:09:29.165
-Okay.
-Come on.

01:09:32.669 --> 01:09:34.738
[Chase] Yeah, it'll be good.
Here we go.

01:09:38.442 --> 01:09:39.843
Have you heard from Chase
this morning?

01:09:39.943 --> 01:09:41.245
Nobody can get
a hold of him.

01:09:41.345 --> 01:09:43.011
No, I haven't.

01:09:43.747 --> 01:09:45.482
Wow, you look so good.

01:09:45.582 --> 01:09:47.451
Thanks. So do you.

01:09:47.551 --> 01:09:50.019
-Have you heard from Zoey?
-No, I haven't.

01:09:50.118 --> 01:09:52.488
Wait. Is this supposed
to be their first look?

01:09:52.589 --> 01:09:54.157
-They're weird like that.
-[Logan] Wait.

01:09:54.258 --> 01:09:57.126
So the maid of honor and
the best man are both missing?

01:09:57.227 --> 01:09:58.595
I can't believe this.

01:10:00.830 --> 01:10:03.767
[Zoey, breathlessly]
How much farther?

01:10:04.268 --> 01:10:05.969
[Chase] Oh. Here.

01:10:06.570 --> 01:10:08.238
Okay. Thank you.

01:10:08.638 --> 01:10:10.474
Here, you wear mine.

01:10:11.275 --> 01:10:12.476
Oh, that's so much better.

01:10:12.576 --> 01:10:13.710
Yeah, this is...

01:10:13.810 --> 01:10:15.612
-This is not better.
-Okay.

01:10:16.346 --> 01:10:17.914
Oh, God.

01:10:18.715 --> 01:10:20.183
[indistinct chatter]

01:10:20.284 --> 01:10:22.619
[music continues]

01:10:28.057 --> 01:10:30.560
[music ends with
an echoing gong note]

01:10:32.862 --> 01:10:34.564
[electronic music playing]

01:10:34.664 --> 01:10:36.866
[vocalizing softly]

01:11:04.093 --> 01:11:05.562
[bell rings]

01:11:06.663 --> 01:11:09.032
So normally I could not
afford Montecito,

01:11:09.132 --> 01:11:13.169
but I can afford Montecito
if the house has had a murder,

01:11:13.269 --> 01:11:15.705
-which this one has.
-Uh-huh.

01:11:15.805 --> 01:11:18.007
-The whole first floor--
-I think that might be wet.

01:11:22.145 --> 01:11:23.513
What is that?

01:11:23.613 --> 01:11:26.282
Uh, it's "White Diamond,"
Mr. Kevyn.

01:11:27.384 --> 01:11:28.585
Benjamin Moore?

01:11:28.685 --> 01:11:29.686
This is a great shade.

01:11:29.786 --> 01:11:30.854
I mean, I love it.

01:11:30.954 --> 01:11:32.489
Will you paint my office
that color?

01:11:32.589 --> 01:11:34.424
-Yeah.
-Great. Now?

01:11:34.524 --> 01:11:35.759
-Oh. Yeah. Yes, sir.
-Now!

01:11:35.859 --> 01:11:37.927
No, in the future. Now!

01:11:38.562 --> 01:11:40.163
-Greg!
-Hi, hi.

01:11:40.263 --> 01:11:41.765
Hey.

01:11:43.567 --> 01:11:46.336
Does anyone have eyes
on the car?

01:11:46.436 --> 01:11:48.838
[dramatic orchestral music
playing]

01:11:52.041 --> 01:11:53.343
[Chase] Oh, God.

01:11:53.943 --> 01:11:55.412
Come on, we gotta go.
We gotta go.

01:11:55.512 --> 01:11:56.813
[Zoey sighs] Okay.

01:11:57.213 --> 01:11:58.848
[cell phone vibrating]

01:12:00.517 --> 01:12:01.985
[phone line ringing]

01:12:06.322 --> 01:12:07.591
-Hello?
-Oh, my God!

01:12:07.691 --> 01:12:09.559
I thought you were dead!
I hoped you were dead!

01:12:09.659 --> 01:12:10.760
I've called you
like a thousand times.

01:12:10.860 --> 01:12:13.229
-Where the hell are you?
-I know, I know.

01:12:13.329 --> 01:12:16.099
So I didn't exactly realize that
the car needed to be charged.

01:12:16.199 --> 01:12:17.934
So it's dead on the side
of the PCH.

01:12:18.034 --> 01:12:19.769
Oh, my God!

01:12:20.404 --> 01:12:21.738
But it's okay.

01:12:21.838 --> 01:12:23.673
The car doesn't even
need to be there...

01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:27.777
because Jordan B. is going
to listen to what I say.

01:12:27.877 --> 01:12:30.146
How are you gonna tell him what
to say if you're not here?

01:12:30.246 --> 01:12:32.416
Archer, you're gonna
have to trust me on this one.

01:12:32.516 --> 01:12:34.384
Well, I actually don't.

01:12:34.484 --> 01:12:36.119
-[sighs]
-Um...

01:12:36.219 --> 01:12:37.954
I didn't mean to eavesdrop,
but it sounds like

01:12:38.054 --> 01:12:40.323
you've gotten yourself into
quite a complicated situation.

01:12:40.424 --> 01:12:42.125
You have no idea.

01:12:42.225 --> 01:12:43.627
[Chase gasping]

01:12:46.162 --> 01:12:47.831

01:12:47.931 --> 01:12:50.299
[electronic music playing]

01:13:04.113 --> 01:13:06.783
Okay, we have waited
as long as we can, all right?

01:13:06.883 --> 01:13:08.117
These guests are gonna leave

01:13:08.217 --> 01:13:09.986
if we have to listen to Lyric
sing anymore.

01:13:10.554 --> 01:13:11.555
[Zoey] Wait.

01:13:11.655 --> 01:13:13.557
We're here.
And we have the rings.

01:13:13.657 --> 01:13:15.258
Quinn, I'm so sorry.
I can explain.

01:13:15.358 --> 01:13:18.695
No. No explanations, all right?
We are late enough as it is.

01:13:18.795 --> 01:13:21.264
Places. Go. Go.

01:13:25.201 --> 01:13:26.235
Cue Lyric.

01:13:30.607 --> 01:13:32.208
[sighs]

01:13:32.308 --> 01:13:33.777
Cue me.

01:13:35.845 --> 01:13:37.714
[vocalizing]

01:13:50.460 --> 01:13:52.128
And cue Michael and Mark.

* This *

01:13:55.131 --> 01:13:58.301
* Is my gift to you *

Cue Camille and Jared.

01:14:02.906 --> 01:14:04.173
* Written *

01:14:05.241 --> 01:14:06.275
* By me *

* For you *

* You together *

* She's in her wedding dress *

01:14:16.185 --> 01:14:20.456
* And he's hoping
she'll say yes... *

01:14:21.157 --> 01:14:22.592
I was really worried
about you.

01:14:22.692 --> 01:14:23.993
I know. I'm so sorry.

01:14:24.093 --> 01:14:25.829
* I wrote it for the both... *

01:14:25.929 --> 01:14:27.597
And Zoey and Chase.

* Ooh *

01:14:30.033 --> 01:14:34.437
* I just want you both
to know *

01:14:34.538 --> 01:14:36.439
* That I wrote this song *

01:14:36.540 --> 01:14:38.474
* Yeah, I wrote this song *

Thirty seconds to showtime.

01:14:40.209 --> 01:14:41.811
[man]
Thirty seconds, everybody.

01:14:41.911 --> 01:14:43.947
Hey, what am I supposed to do?

01:14:44.047 --> 01:14:45.582
Are you seriously
asking me that?

01:14:45.682 --> 01:14:47.817
-Yes.
-If you pick a Pontiac over me

01:14:47.917 --> 01:14:49.118
on live television,

01:14:49.218 --> 01:14:51.921
I will make your life
a living hell, hmm?

01:14:52.488 --> 01:14:53.590
Hey, pal.

01:14:54.157 --> 01:14:56.459
Pre-show jitters
are totally normal, okay?

01:14:56.560 --> 01:15:00.864
Here's what I want you to do.
Just relax and listen to Zoey.

01:15:00.964 --> 01:15:03.166
-Can you do that for me?
-I think so.

01:15:03.967 --> 01:15:05.101
You're gonna be great.

01:15:05.201 --> 01:15:07.571
-Oh, who's Zoey?
-She's not here, dude.

01:15:07.671 --> 01:15:09.372
You'll have to manage this
on your own.

01:15:10.707 --> 01:15:12.208
-Nice hair, by the way.
-Thanks.

01:15:12.308 --> 01:15:15.244
-Fifteen seconds.
-Wow, okay, Joey. Thank you.

01:15:18.514 --> 01:15:20.116
[Kelley]
And paging Zoey.

01:15:22.619 --> 01:15:23.920
Zoey, do you copy?

01:15:25.655 --> 01:15:27.123
Where's the girl?

01:15:27.957 --> 01:15:30.359
[Zoey, on earpiece]
I'm here. I'm here, Jordan.

01:15:30.459 --> 01:15:32.796
You got this, buddy.
Just take a deep breath for me.

01:15:32.896 --> 01:15:34.163
[inhales sharply]

01:15:34.263 --> 01:15:35.531
[sighs loudly]

01:15:35.632 --> 01:15:36.733
This should be fun.

01:15:36.833 --> 01:15:38.434
Please rise.

01:15:39.368 --> 01:15:41.938
[gentle music continues]

01:15:58.855 --> 01:16:00.389
Welcome to
the LOVE: Fully Charged

01:16:00.489 --> 01:16:02.726
season six live finale!

01:16:02.826 --> 01:16:04.193
[applause]

01:16:04.994 --> 01:16:07.631
I'm your host, Archer March.
Three couples remain.

01:16:07.731 --> 01:16:09.198
But only one can win.

01:16:09.298 --> 01:16:11.835
And that couple will soon
be revealed.

01:16:11.935 --> 01:16:13.502
[applause]

01:16:15.438 --> 01:16:16.840
First, let's look
at some highlights

01:16:16.940 --> 01:16:17.907
from this juicy season.

01:16:18.007 --> 01:16:20.844
[gentle music continues]

01:16:24.681 --> 01:16:28.017
[song continues indistinctly]

01:16:29.452 --> 01:16:31.420
[vocalizations continue]

01:16:33.790 --> 01:16:35.191
Love you.

01:16:39.796 --> 01:16:41.631
[in deep, booming voice]
You may be seated.

01:16:43.532 --> 01:16:44.567
No?

01:16:44.668 --> 01:16:46.035
[clears throat]

01:16:46.703 --> 01:16:47.937
Dearly beloved...

01:16:48.037 --> 01:16:49.773
[Archer] Are you ready, America?

01:16:49.873 --> 01:16:51.140
[audience cheers]

01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:53.743
I don't know about you,
but my heart is racing.

01:16:53.843 --> 01:16:56.345
Ugh, I'm sorry.
I just hate their faces.

01:16:56.445 --> 01:16:57.480
Is it just me?

01:16:58.114 --> 01:16:59.983
Don't-- I'd like you
not to answer.

01:17:00.383 --> 01:17:02.686
...of two of my very favorite
people in the world.

01:17:02.786 --> 01:17:06.756
A genius, whose discoveries
will define a generation,

01:17:06.856 --> 01:17:08.591
and my rich friend,
Logan Reese.

01:17:09.425 --> 01:17:14.397
the winners of LOVE:
Fully Charged season six are...

01:17:14.898 --> 01:17:15.999
Jordan B. and Jordyn J.!

01:17:16.099 --> 01:17:17.500
[audience cheering]

01:17:17.967 --> 01:17:19.903
Congratulations, you guys.

01:17:20.003 --> 01:17:22.505
Wow. This is so well-deserved.

01:17:22.605 --> 01:17:24.307
How are you feeling right now?

01:17:24.407 --> 01:17:25.942
Uh...

01:17:26.042 --> 01:17:27.110
Say, "It wouldn't
have been possible

01:17:27.210 --> 01:17:28.778
without this beautiful woman."

01:17:28.878 --> 01:17:31.748
It wouldn't have been possible
without this beautiful woman.

01:17:31.848 --> 01:17:32.882
[audience]
Aw!

01:17:32.982 --> 01:17:35.885
Oh, um, did the maid of honor

01:17:35.985 --> 01:17:37.887
have something
she wanted to say?

01:17:37.987 --> 01:17:39.622
-[feedback squeals]
-Oh, no! God!

01:17:39.723 --> 01:17:40.589
[people murmuring]

01:17:40.690 --> 01:17:42.391
Oh, no! God!

01:17:42.491 --> 01:17:43.659
[Zoey] Sorry.

01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:46.429
I'm just so overwhelmed
with emotion.

01:17:46.830 --> 01:17:49.532
Uh-huh. Um, as I was saying...

01:17:49.632 --> 01:17:52.368
Sorry, I'm just so overwhelmed
with emotion.

01:17:53.569 --> 01:17:55.972
[Archer] Okay, well, um,
don't get too excited,

01:17:56.072 --> 01:17:57.340
because it's not over yet.

01:17:57.440 --> 01:17:59.142
You still have a very big
decision to make.

01:17:59.242 --> 01:18:02.411
Tight on the garage.
Perfect. Very nice.

01:18:02.511 --> 01:18:05.681
Should anyone present
know of any reason

01:18:05.782 --> 01:18:09.285
that this couple should not
be joined in holy matrimony,

01:18:09.385 --> 01:18:13.122
speak now or forever
hold your peace.

01:18:13.723 --> 01:18:15.258
[music fades]

01:18:15.358 --> 01:18:17.326
[deep, rumbling note resonates]

01:18:17.794 --> 01:18:19.028
Stacey.

01:18:25.034 --> 01:18:26.669
[Stacey] You.

01:18:27.737 --> 01:18:28.704
It's you.

01:18:30.673 --> 01:18:31.741
Mark.

01:18:32.375 --> 01:18:33.576
Hugo.

01:18:34.010 --> 01:18:35.611
You were right under my nose.

01:18:35.711 --> 01:18:37.280
How did I not see it sooner?

01:18:37.380 --> 01:18:40.516
First, you came to the welcome
reception in dirty scrubs,

01:18:40.616 --> 01:18:44.353
and no self-respecting ER doctor
would ever leave the hospital

01:18:44.453 --> 01:18:45.855
in dirty scrubs.

01:18:45.955 --> 01:18:48.724
Two, you said you were
from Burbank,

01:18:48.825 --> 01:18:50.693
which is not in Australia.

01:18:50.794 --> 01:18:52.295
And also...

01:18:52.728 --> 01:18:55.464
you have massive hands.

01:18:56.032 --> 01:18:57.033
Hey, look...

01:18:57.133 --> 01:19:01.170
Everyone, this man
is not the charming,

01:19:01.270 --> 01:19:03.439
selfless, hilarious,

01:19:03.539 --> 01:19:08.011
extremely jacked Hemsworth
cousin that we all thought.

01:19:08.111 --> 01:19:11.915
This man is the Malibu Murderer!

01:19:12.015 --> 01:19:14.483
-[all gasp]
-Wait, wait? Murderer?

01:19:14.984 --> 01:19:16.652
No, no, no, no. I...

01:19:18.021 --> 01:19:19.688
[in normal voice]
I'm not a murderer.

01:19:23.592 --> 01:19:24.527
I'm an actor.

01:19:24.627 --> 01:19:25.962
[indistinct murmuring]

01:19:26.662 --> 01:19:29.698
Jordan B., what do you love most
about Jordyn J.?

01:19:29.799 --> 01:19:32.268
-What's going on?
-Nothing, absolutely nothing.

01:19:32.368 --> 01:19:34.570
Nothing, absolutely nothing.

01:19:34.670 --> 01:19:35.839
[audience gasps]

01:19:36.439 --> 01:19:39.375
[Archer] Jordan B.,
we're all a little confused.

01:19:39.475 --> 01:19:41.845
What is it that you really want?

01:19:42.778 --> 01:19:46.149
If it's absolutely nothing,
then why were you late?

01:19:46.249 --> 01:19:47.951
It was the car! The car!

01:19:48.051 --> 01:19:49.785
[gasps]
No, Jordan, not you.

01:19:49.886 --> 01:19:51.855
The car. Oh, the car!

01:19:51.955 --> 01:19:53.556
No, Jordan, not you.

01:19:53.656 --> 01:19:55.424
[audience gasps]

01:19:55.524 --> 01:19:56.725
[mouthing]

01:19:56.826 --> 01:19:58.227
Can you explain all of this?

01:19:58.327 --> 01:19:59.795
Yes. Sorry. Of course.

01:19:59.896 --> 01:20:01.464
Am I hearing you correctly?

01:20:01.564 --> 01:20:03.566
[laughs nervously]
You're choosing the car?

01:20:03.666 --> 01:20:06.335
Yes. Sorry. Of course.

01:20:06.435 --> 01:20:07.937
[crying]

01:20:08.037 --> 01:20:09.805
Open the garage, I guess.

01:20:09.906 --> 01:20:12.808
[tense music playing]

01:20:16.779 --> 01:20:18.314
[Kelley] Where is the car?

01:20:18.714 --> 01:20:21.684
Where is the effing car?

01:20:21.784 --> 01:20:22.952
Greg?

01:20:23.052 --> 01:20:25.521
Are you watching
LOVE: Fully Charged ?

01:20:25.621 --> 01:20:27.123
Oh! Who won?

01:20:28.958 --> 01:20:30.159
What is going on?

01:20:30.259 --> 01:20:32.595
[somber music playing]

01:20:33.629 --> 01:20:34.830
I'm working.

01:20:35.231 --> 01:20:36.565
I'm working during your wedding.

01:20:36.665 --> 01:20:40.269
I got an opportunity,
and I tried to do both.

01:20:40.369 --> 01:20:42.505
If you had to work,
why didn't you just tell me?

01:20:43.239 --> 01:20:46.175
Because this is so important,
and you were so excited.

01:20:46.275 --> 01:20:49.178
So I lied. To myself, to you.

01:20:49.278 --> 01:20:50.746
To everyone.

01:20:52.648 --> 01:20:55.784
What about him?
What is Stacey talking about?

01:20:55.885 --> 01:20:57.386
Hugo is not a murderer.

01:20:57.486 --> 01:21:00.856
I'm not sure how she came
to that conclusion.

01:21:02.825 --> 01:21:04.193
His name is Todd,

01:21:04.293 --> 01:21:07.663
and I hired him to be
my boyfriend for the weekend.

01:21:08.431 --> 01:21:10.633
I knew something
was going on with you.

01:21:11.634 --> 01:21:14.237
You've been distant
and distracted,

01:21:14.837 --> 01:21:17.740
and you completely abandoned me
when I needed you the most.

01:21:18.407 --> 01:21:21.110
To do what? Hang out with Chase?

01:21:21.744 --> 01:21:23.646
Zoey, you should be
ashamed of yourself.

01:21:23.746 --> 01:21:25.381
Logan, don't even start.

01:21:26.015 --> 01:21:28.384
You care more about
making this wedding a spectacle

01:21:28.484 --> 01:21:30.353
than about making it meaningful.

01:21:30.453 --> 01:21:34.257
You completely ignored me
every step of the way.

01:21:35.558 --> 01:21:38.261
None of this is what I wanted.

01:21:42.731 --> 01:21:43.832
Our wedding is off.

01:21:43.933 --> 01:21:45.534
[crowd gasps]

01:21:47.336 --> 01:21:52.175
* If I'm so smart *

01:21:53.109 --> 01:21:56.879
* Why do I feel so dumb? *

01:21:58.281 --> 01:22:00.616
* Why did you take *

01:22:00.716 --> 01:22:03.519
* My heart *

01:22:04.087 --> 01:22:07.957
* Then just cut and run? *

01:22:08.557 --> 01:22:14.063
* And if the pain is real *

01:22:14.497 --> 01:22:19.602
* Why do I feel so numb? *

01:22:21.104 --> 01:22:25.975
* And if I'm so smart... *

01:22:27.043 --> 01:22:29.512
-[audience jeering]
-I don't know what's happening.

01:22:29.612 --> 01:22:31.547
I don't know
what's happening.

01:22:31.647 --> 01:22:34.350
I could do
everyone's job in here

01:22:34.450 --> 01:22:37.386
better than everyone who
is not doing their job in here.

01:22:37.486 --> 01:22:39.322
Everyone's fired. Get out.

01:22:39.422 --> 01:22:41.890
* ...feel so down *

01:22:43.126 --> 01:22:45.094
* Why do I see *

01:22:45.194 --> 01:22:47.096
So I guess this is a wrap
on me then, huh?

01:22:47.930 --> 01:22:50.766
Yeah. Thanks for everything
this weekend.

01:22:51.300 --> 01:22:53.169
I'm so sorry I dragged you
into all this,

01:22:53.269 --> 01:22:54.770
and I can't even
get you on the show.

01:22:55.471 --> 01:22:56.572
I'm an actor in L.A.

01:22:56.672 --> 01:22:59.608
I kind of expect
to be disappointed.

01:23:00.776 --> 01:23:02.345
You got my head shot
and resume?

01:23:02.445 --> 01:23:03.912
-Yeah.
-Okay.

01:23:05.414 --> 01:23:10.719
* If I'm so high *

01:23:11.087 --> 01:23:14.790
* Why do I feel so down? *

01:23:14.890 --> 01:23:16.025
[sighs]

01:23:16.525 --> 01:23:21.030
* And if I'm so brave *

01:23:22.098 --> 01:23:26.001
* Why do I feel so scared? *

01:23:27.336 --> 01:23:32.608
* Why did you tell me stay *

01:23:33.209 --> 01:23:36.545
* Then just disappear *

01:23:37.580 --> 01:23:39.415
* And if it's true *

01:23:39.515 --> 01:23:43.119
* You're going *

01:23:43.219 --> 01:23:48.857
* Why do I still
feel you here? *

01:23:50.993 --> 01:23:54.029
* So long, farewell *

01:23:54.130 --> 01:23:55.998
* Goodbye *

01:23:56.632 --> 01:23:59.802
* So long, farewell *

01:23:59.902 --> 01:24:01.537
* Goodbye *

01:24:05.574 --> 01:24:07.910
* Goodbye *

01:24:08.544 --> 01:24:10.679
-Hey.
-Hey.

01:24:12.014 --> 01:24:15.818
So, did you talk to Danielle?
I mean, I feel awful.

01:24:17.586 --> 01:24:20.022
Zoey, I...
I have a confession.

01:24:21.690 --> 01:24:23.959
Danielle and I actually broke up
two weeks ago.

01:24:25.194 --> 01:24:26.729
She agreed to still
come with me to the wedding

01:24:26.829 --> 01:24:28.464
so I didn't have
to show up alone.

01:24:29.798 --> 01:24:31.600
Well, at least you didn't
hire an actor.

01:24:31.700 --> 01:24:33.802
[laughs]
Yeah, there's that.

01:24:33.902 --> 01:24:36.071
[gentle music playing]

01:24:38.607 --> 01:24:40.976
How did I screw this up so bad,

01:24:41.076 --> 01:24:42.745
and when did life get so messy?

01:24:43.512 --> 01:24:44.780
I know we thought
high school was hard,

01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:48.217
but I would kill
to go back to PCA.

01:24:49.318 --> 01:24:52.155
Yeah, it's too bad Quinn hasn't
invented a time machine yet.

01:24:52.755 --> 01:24:54.390
I'm sure we'd all love
to go back.

01:24:55.391 --> 01:24:56.625
Yeah.

01:25:01.764 --> 01:25:02.731
Go back.

01:25:03.466 --> 01:25:05.234
That's exactly
what we need to do.

01:25:05.334 --> 01:25:06.702
Uh, what?

01:25:06.802 --> 01:25:09.538
[dramatic orchestral music
playing]

01:25:22.851 --> 01:25:24.220
[music fades]

01:25:24.753 --> 01:25:26.989
[Zoey]
This is gonna take a while.

01:25:29.592 --> 01:25:31.394
All right, people,
let's get to work.

01:25:31.494 --> 01:25:32.895
Let's do it.

01:25:34.330 --> 01:25:35.631
[Stacey]
Think there's anything left

01:25:35.731 --> 01:25:37.633
in the old
arts and crafts studio?

01:25:40.203 --> 01:25:41.404
You know, this is great and all,

01:25:41.504 --> 01:25:42.838
but what if I can't
get her here?

01:25:42.938 --> 01:25:45.541
I've tried flower arrangements,
edible arrangements,

01:25:45.641 --> 01:25:47.210
a sky writer, nothing.

01:25:47.310 --> 01:25:49.144
Have you tried talking to her?

01:25:49.245 --> 01:25:51.314
-No!
-Maybe try that.

01:25:51.414 --> 01:25:53.449
-There's so much to do.
-I know. I know.

01:25:53.549 --> 01:25:55.918
Do you mind helping Ms. Reese
with lights over there?

01:25:56.018 --> 01:25:57.052
Thank you.

01:25:57.152 --> 01:25:59.822
[Stacey] I don't know, Mark!
Just be helpful!

01:25:59.922 --> 01:26:01.424
-I'm trying.
-Here, I'll help.

01:26:01.524 --> 01:26:03.025
-Thank you.
-Got it.

01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:06.061
Zoey!

01:26:06.161 --> 01:26:07.596
Look what I found!

01:26:07.696 --> 01:26:10.165
No, no, you're under strict
vocal rest until it's time.

01:26:11.500 --> 01:26:12.901
Is this cake?

01:26:13.736 --> 01:26:16.004
-Yeah.
-I knew it.

01:26:16.705 --> 01:26:17.740
[Chase] Okay, okay.

01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:19.342
Okay, listen,
I know that we thought

01:26:19.442 --> 01:26:20.776
Sushi Rox closed
when the school did,

01:26:20.876 --> 01:26:22.845
but it turns out Kazu's son
started a food truck,

01:26:22.945 --> 01:26:24.547
and they'd be more than happy
to cater.

01:26:24.647 --> 01:26:26.615
Perfect. She loves sushi.

01:26:26.715 --> 01:26:28.417
Cool, I think
that covers everything, right?

01:26:28.517 --> 01:26:29.852
Except for music.

01:26:29.952 --> 01:26:31.654
I know that Quinn was really
excited about the band,

01:26:31.754 --> 01:26:33.456
but unfortunately
they're unavailable today.

01:26:33.556 --> 01:26:34.890
So who are we gonna get
to play the music?

01:26:34.990 --> 01:26:36.024
Me.

01:26:36.625 --> 01:26:37.926
I'm a DJ too.

01:26:39.262 --> 01:26:42.164
* You're welcome *

01:26:42.731 --> 01:26:45.033
Sounds pretty good.
That settles it.

01:26:46.068 --> 01:26:47.470
So, what do we do now?

01:26:48.237 --> 01:26:50.773
Now? We wait.

01:26:55.411 --> 01:26:58.481

[music softens, brightens]

01:27:21.036 --> 01:27:22.738
I'm so sorry, Quinn!

01:27:24.106 --> 01:27:26.241
Maybe this all happened
for a reason.

01:27:26.909 --> 01:27:29.211
Maybe we just want
different things.

01:27:30.078 --> 01:27:32.281
-And maybe that's okay.
-No!

01:27:32.981 --> 01:27:36.685
I don't want different things.
I only want what you want.

01:27:37.920 --> 01:27:40.456
I was trying so hard
to make this wedding perfect

01:27:40.556 --> 01:27:42.658
for me and for you.

01:27:43.492 --> 01:27:45.561
I stopped thinking about us.

01:27:45.994 --> 01:27:46.895
I was an idiot.

01:27:46.995 --> 01:27:49.031
I was worse than an idiot.
I was--

01:27:49.131 --> 01:27:50.265
A groomzilla?

01:27:50.366 --> 01:27:51.767
Yes.

01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:53.736
Is that a thing?

01:27:54.503 --> 01:27:56.972
All I know is I want
to be with you...

01:27:57.773 --> 01:28:00.075
because I love you, Quinn.

01:28:02.244 --> 01:28:04.046
I love you too, Logan.

01:28:04.747 --> 01:28:07.182
I love Quinn Pensky!

01:28:07.282 --> 01:28:10.185
And I love Logan Reese!

01:28:10.285 --> 01:28:12.087
[man] Shut up!

01:28:13.622 --> 01:28:15.257
Hang on, I'll buzz you up.

01:28:15.358 --> 01:28:16.792
Can you come down?

01:28:17.793 --> 01:28:19.562
I was hoping we could go
for a ride.

01:28:19.662 --> 01:28:22.631
Logan, where are we?
What are we doing?

01:28:23.399 --> 01:28:26.402
[music slowly builds]

01:28:50.325 --> 01:28:52.695
[music softens]

01:28:55.931 --> 01:28:57.032
Hi.

01:28:57.466 --> 01:28:58.701
Hi.

01:28:59.468 --> 01:29:00.836
What is all this?

01:29:01.670 --> 01:29:02.638
Did you do this?

01:29:02.738 --> 01:29:04.306
We all did.

01:29:05.574 --> 01:29:08.343
Quinn, I'm so sorry.

01:29:09.445 --> 01:29:11.013
You can't not marry
your best friend

01:29:11.113 --> 01:29:13.281
because your other best friend
ruined it.

01:29:15.384 --> 01:29:16.952
But I'm wearing this.

01:29:17.386 --> 01:29:18.954
Well, you did always say

01:29:19.054 --> 01:29:21.323
that you'd rather get married
in a lab coat.

01:29:26.294 --> 01:29:28.196
-[laughs]
-Here.

01:29:33.135 --> 01:29:35.638
How do you feel?

01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:39.207
Like myself.

01:29:45.748 --> 01:29:47.182
Quinn Pensky...

01:29:47.916 --> 01:29:50.118
will you marry me still?

01:29:51.554 --> 01:29:53.021
-Yes?
-Yeah.

01:29:53.822 --> 01:29:55.558
-Yes! Yes!
-[all laugh]

01:29:56.091 --> 01:29:58.527

[Michael, hoarsely]
Dearly beloved.

01:30:13.208 --> 01:30:16.078
-[in normal voice] Just kidding!
-[all laugh]

01:30:17.646 --> 01:30:19.715
We're gathered here today

01:30:19.815 --> 01:30:21.684
to celebrate this beautiful love

01:30:21.784 --> 01:30:24.953
between Quinn Pensky
and Logan Reese.

[upbeat dance music playing]

01:30:28.957 --> 01:30:31.126
Seriously, best ceremony
I've ever heard.

01:30:31.226 --> 01:30:33.862
I mean, hilarious,
heartbreaking, personal.

01:30:33.962 --> 01:30:35.163
Did you write that yourself?

01:30:35.263 --> 01:30:36.765
I've been writing that
since high school

01:30:36.865 --> 01:30:37.933
when they first fell in love.

01:30:38.033 --> 01:30:39.535
You should do our wedding.

01:30:39.635 --> 01:30:41.837
Oh, I'm down.
Let's do it. Let's go!

01:30:41.937 --> 01:30:43.806
[cell phone vibrating]

01:30:43.906 --> 01:30:44.840
Oh, excuse me.

01:30:44.940 --> 01:30:46.308
I have to take this.

01:30:50.178 --> 01:30:51.747
Kelley, I know
what you're going to say,

01:30:51.847 --> 01:30:53.716
and my stuff will be out
of the office on Monday.

01:30:53.816 --> 01:30:55.417
[Kelley]
I'm promoting you.

01:30:55.518 --> 01:30:56.485
You're what?

01:30:56.585 --> 01:30:57.586
The numbers are in.

01:30:57.686 --> 01:30:59.855

The network is sharting
their brains with happiness.

01:31:06.028 --> 01:31:09.364
They want a spin-off
with both Jordans.

01:31:09.464 --> 01:31:11.466
I want you on my team.

01:31:11.567 --> 01:31:14.402
-I don't know what to say.
-There is so much more to you

01:31:14.503 --> 01:31:15.638
than meets the eye.

01:31:15.738 --> 01:31:16.772
You have so much more
to offer.

01:31:16.872 --> 01:31:19.307
What you did by throwing out

01:31:19.407 --> 01:31:21.476
every reality TV trope,

01:31:21.577 --> 01:31:24.212
by ignoring me at every turn,

01:31:24.312 --> 01:31:26.014
that took balls.

01:31:28.917 --> 01:31:30.485
I respect balls.

01:31:31.654 --> 01:31:33.488
-You're right.
-What?

01:31:33.589 --> 01:31:35.357
I do have a lot to offer.

01:31:35.457 --> 01:31:37.626
And I'm tired of wasting it
on people who don't deserve it,

01:31:37.726 --> 01:31:38.761
like you.

01:31:38.861 --> 01:31:40.529
-I quit.
-I'll double your salary.

01:31:42.430 --> 01:31:44.499
-And give me the corner office?
-Yeah, sure.

01:31:44.600 --> 01:31:46.168
And fire Greg?

01:31:47.435 --> 01:31:48.571
-Hey, Greg?
-What?

01:31:48.671 --> 01:31:49.905
You're fired.

01:31:52.407 --> 01:31:53.375
All right.

01:31:53.876 --> 01:31:56.745
-Yeah, done.
-[Stacey] Oh, there he is! Todd!

01:31:56.845 --> 01:31:58.313

01:31:59.915 --> 01:32:01.116
One more thing.

01:32:04.687 --> 01:32:05.921
Deal.

01:32:08.256 --> 01:32:09.224
Hey, Jordan?

01:32:11.226 --> 01:32:12.260
Go home.

01:32:12.661 --> 01:32:14.362
I don't know where I live!

01:32:14.462 --> 01:32:18.500
I am sorry that I accused you
of being a murderer,

01:32:18.601 --> 01:32:21.069
but you have to understand
it was not my fault.

01:32:21.169 --> 01:32:24.006
It was Mark's.
Mark, what did you do?

01:32:24.106 --> 01:32:26.141
I followed a bad lead.

01:32:26.241 --> 01:32:29.377
That's right. And what do you
have to say to Quinn?

01:32:29.978 --> 01:32:32.648
I am sorry
we ruined your wedding?

01:32:32.748 --> 01:32:33.916

01:32:34.016 --> 01:32:36.184
I'm sorry I ruined your wedding.

01:32:36.284 --> 01:32:37.185
[Stacey] Better.

01:32:37.653 --> 01:32:41.056
Oh, I am also very sorry,
but he does not speak for me.

01:32:41.156 --> 01:32:43.091
-[scoffs]
-No, it's a feminism thing.

01:32:43.191 --> 01:32:45.127
We do that--
Where are you going?

01:32:45.594 --> 01:32:46.829
Todd, you made it.

01:32:46.929 --> 01:32:49.131
I'm so sorry I'm late.

Well, you may not
have to anymore,

01:32:51.166 --> 01:32:53.001
because I got you on the show!

01:32:53.602 --> 01:32:54.837
-No.
-Yes!

it is really cold out there.

and don't quote me,

01:34:13.115 --> 01:34:16.685
but I heard there are schools
in California.

Oh, well...

So great meeting you, Todd.

01:36:42.030 --> 01:36:43.999
Sorry again
about that little mix-up.

01:36:44.099 --> 01:36:45.800
Oh, don't even worry about it.

01:36:45.901 --> 01:36:47.970

Uh-huh, what's the line?
[laughs]

01:37:35.583 --> 01:37:37.986
I'm sorry to this camera
that has to go back and forth.

Are you guys still filming me?
Can I ask an honest question?

01:37:53.401 --> 01:37:55.537
Can you tell that these are
ladies' leggings?

01:37:56.604 --> 01:37:58.873
I don't think you can tell.
Right?
