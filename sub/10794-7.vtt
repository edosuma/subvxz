WEBVTT

00:01.269 --> 00:02.703
RUSH: This is what
 Destiny intended

00:02.735 --> 00:04.838
from the moment it
 entered the star system.

00:04.872 --> 00:08.176
YOUNG:
 That ship is the best chance
 we have of getting home.

00:08.209 --> 00:09.343
Are we done?

00:09.377 --> 00:11.879
We'll never be done.

00:11.912 --> 00:13.314
WRAY:
 You shouldn't have left him
 on the planet.

00:13.347 --> 00:15.249
YOUNG:
 You think I don't know that?

00:15.283 --> 00:16.484
CHLOE:
 Everyone thinks we're safe.

00:16.517 --> 00:19.153
They think that
 they'll never find us again.

00:19.187 --> 00:20.821
Why did you take
 one of our people
 prisoner?

00:20.854 --> 00:22.356
(SNARLS)

00:22.390 --> 00:24.024
CHLOE: We're not safe,
 are we?

00:24.058 --> 00:25.993
TELFORD: They're coming!
 Who's coming?

00:26.026 --> 00:28.229
Lucian Alliance.
They're coming
to take Destiny.

00:28.262 --> 00:29.530
RUSH: There's only one way
 this is going to
 end if we wait.

00:29.563 --> 00:31.532
YOUNG: I'm not
 surrendering this ship.

00:31.565 --> 00:34.868
What if we can increase
the FTL drive's efficiency?

00:34.902 --> 00:36.437
Who's the best?
 RUSH: Amanda Perry.

00:36.470 --> 00:39.207
Nick...
 RUSH: For all her abilities,

00:39.240 --> 00:41.375
there are certain
 disabilities of which
 you should be made aware.

00:41.409 --> 00:43.777
YOUNG: This ship is affecting
 the crew's dreams?

00:43.811 --> 00:45.213
RUSH:
 But what if this is a test?

00:45.246 --> 00:46.180
JOHANSEN:
 A test he's failing.

00:46.214 --> 00:47.848
GINN:
 I'd like to offer my help.

00:47.881 --> 00:51.252
I spent over a year
 studying Ancient systems
 to prepare for the trip.

00:51.285 --> 00:53.020
We can't spend
 the rest of our days

00:53.053 --> 00:54.588
here on this
 ship as prisoners.

00:54.622 --> 00:56.357
YOUNG: Should have
 thought about that
 before you attacked us.

00:56.390 --> 00:58.192
I may be on the verge

00:58.226 --> 01:00.428
of discovering
 the true nature
 of Destiny's mission.

01:12.940 --> 01:14.942
WRAY OVER RADIO:
 Colonel Young.

01:19.113 --> 01:20.414
Yeah.

01:20.448 --> 01:22.316
Morning briefing.
 You're late.

01:33.494 --> 01:37.298
She's been the most
 cooperative of all
 the Lucian Alliance members.

01:37.331 --> 01:40.000
Homeworld Security
 wants to talk to her now.

01:40.033 --> 01:42.102
About the planned
attack on Earth?

01:42.136 --> 01:44.605
Some of Ginn's people,
 a clan from
 her home planet,

01:44.638 --> 01:47.275
are believed to be
the ones behind it.

01:47.308 --> 01:49.577
She may know
 the location
 of their base.

01:49.610 --> 01:52.346
Or at least point
 us to the people
 who do know.

01:59.487 --> 02:00.988
Okay.

02:14.568 --> 02:16.370
Is she in there?

02:16.404 --> 02:18.839
Yeah.
 But you should know she's...

02:20.641 --> 02:23.977
Hello, Ginn.

02:24.011 --> 02:27.181
Our people on Earth
 have asked if you could use
 the communication stones

02:27.215 --> 02:28.982
to come
 and talk with them.

02:29.016 --> 02:32.486
(PANTING) Oh. Um, sure.

02:32.520 --> 02:34.488
I'm sorry,
 did I interrupt something?

02:34.522 --> 02:39.493
No. I,
uh, was just,
um, sleeping.

02:42.896 --> 02:45.866
Anyway, they were hoping
 to talk to you this afternoon,

02:45.899 --> 02:47.034
if that's all right
 with you.

02:47.067 --> 02:49.002
Sure.
 Good.

02:49.036 --> 02:51.339
I'll come by later,
 fill you in on the protocol
 involving the stones.

02:51.372 --> 02:52.306
Of course.

02:52.340 --> 02:53.907
Thank you.

03:07.054 --> 03:09.523
BRODY: Twelve hours
on the countdown clock
but the gate's not dialing.

03:09.557 --> 03:11.659
No planets in range.
 We tried calling Rush.

03:11.692 --> 03:14.194
No response, as usual.

03:15.429 --> 03:16.930
Rush, come in.

03:18.266 --> 03:19.500
(CONSOLE CHIMES)

03:19.533 --> 03:22.236
Wait a minute.

03:22.270 --> 03:24.605
There is something out there,
 straight ahead of us.

03:24.638 --> 03:26.240
VOLKER: What is it?

03:26.274 --> 03:27.575
Some kind of ship.

03:27.608 --> 03:29.577
Definitely not
 a seed ship.

03:29.610 --> 03:32.413
JOHANSEN: It doesn't look
 like the aliens
 we encountered before, either.

03:34.214 --> 03:35.916
New friends.

03:36.550 --> 03:37.985
Yay.

03:57.237 --> 03:58.739
Looks like
 it's been
 through a battle.

03:58.772 --> 04:00.441
And got
 its ass kicked.

04:06.647 --> 04:08.316
(ENGINES POWERING)

04:19.159 --> 04:22.330
BRODY: Looks deserted.
 Whoever was on board
 must have evacuated.

04:24.532 --> 04:25.499
Where the hell were you?

04:25.533 --> 04:27.267
I was working.

04:27.301 --> 04:28.569
I want to know
 what the hell you were doing.

04:28.602 --> 04:31.605
I was busy. I'm here now.
 Can we deal
 with the matter in hand?

04:38.479 --> 04:40.348
VOLKER: We sent over a Kino.

04:40.381 --> 04:41.782
RUSH: Have you found anything?

04:41.815 --> 04:44.318
Ship's empty.

04:44.352 --> 04:46.019
Looks like they
 were in a battle,
 probably abandoned ship.

04:46.053 --> 04:47.788
We should send over
 a boarding party.

04:47.821 --> 04:49.623
We got no shuttle.

04:49.657 --> 04:51.659
We could
 use the space suits.

04:51.692 --> 04:53.126
What, to just jump over?

04:53.160 --> 04:55.663
Yes. Destiny
 stopped here for a reason.

04:55.696 --> 04:58.366
Who knows what kind of data
 or technology
 could be salvaged.

04:58.399 --> 04:59.367
Well, who's going to go?

05:01.201 --> 05:03.371
I'll go.

05:03.404 --> 05:05.005
Kind of risky
 for you to be...

05:05.038 --> 05:06.374
The ship is deserted.

05:06.407 --> 05:09.009
I'm the expert
 in alien technology.
 I should go.

05:14.548 --> 05:17.284
You have just over
 six hours of suit air,

05:17.317 --> 05:20.020
in case you
 can't get the ship's
 life support online.

05:23.524 --> 05:26.326
All right, Colonel,
maybe I should go
with him instead.

05:26.360 --> 05:28.228
You say that now
 that I'm already
 in the suit?

05:28.261 --> 05:30.364
I'm just not sure
 it's such a good idea
 for you to be doing this.

05:30.398 --> 05:31.732
The crew
 needs you here...

05:31.765 --> 05:35.836
I need to keep an eye on him.
 Don't worry, Lieutenant.

05:35.869 --> 05:38.038
I'm not going to
 leave him behind.

05:45.278 --> 05:47.648
Rush and Young
 are going to go over
 and check it out,

05:47.681 --> 05:49.182
see if there's anything
worth salvaging.

05:51.619 --> 05:53.353
What's this?

05:53.387 --> 05:57.057
Oh, some equations
 Rush asked me
 to look at.

05:58.892 --> 06:00.561
You understand all this?

06:05.466 --> 06:09.069
I'm sorry I haven't been by
as much lately.

06:09.570 --> 06:11.071
I've been really...

06:13.741 --> 06:16.376
It's okay.

06:16.410 --> 06:18.579
I heard you and one
 of the Lucian Alliance people

06:18.612 --> 06:21.782
have been
 working together a lot.
 Ginn?

06:21.815 --> 06:23.216
Yeah.

06:24.752 --> 06:26.454
Who told you?

06:26.487 --> 06:27.821
Matt.
 Ah. (CHUCKLES)

06:33.761 --> 06:36.797
See, we were
 working together
 on this thing,

06:36.830 --> 06:40.634
the dialing
 from inside a star,
 and I got to know her.

06:40.668 --> 06:42.803
And she is really...

06:43.904 --> 06:45.439
I don't know.

06:45.473 --> 06:49.242
We became friends,
 and then, out of nowhere...

06:49.276 --> 06:50.444
Hey.

06:51.479 --> 06:53.180
I'm happy for you.

07:06.960 --> 07:08.529
YOUNG OVER RADIO:
 Okay, we're good.
 Open the door.

07:26.980 --> 07:29.149
Looks like
 the bridge is destroyed.

07:42.663 --> 07:45.398
Okay, I'm in.
 Line's secured.
 Come on over.

07:57.745 --> 07:59.547
Destiny,
 we are on board the ship.

07:59.580 --> 08:01.214
Copy that.

08:37.885 --> 08:39.720
YOUNG:
 Bulkhead's sealed.

08:39.753 --> 08:41.655
Is there life support?

08:41.688 --> 08:45.258
Not yet,
 but we have gravity,
 so that is a start.

08:45.292 --> 08:48.662
The place
 is pretty banged up.

08:48.696 --> 08:51.699
Hopefully we can find a way
 to access control of the...

08:55.736 --> 08:57.537
Colonel, you still there?

08:57.571 --> 09:00.540
Yeah, we're here. Is that...

09:00.574 --> 09:02.275
RUSH: It is.

09:02.309 --> 09:03.744
ELI: What? What?
 What is it?

09:03.777 --> 09:05.779
RUSH: Pods.

09:05.813 --> 09:07.948
The aliens we encountered
 on the seed ship.

09:07.981 --> 09:10.851
Maybe you should
 come back,
 not take any chances?

09:10.884 --> 09:12.786
YOUNG: Don't worry,
 the pods are empty.

09:12.820 --> 09:16.289
Well, there could be
 pods elsewhere
 on the ship that aren't empty.

09:16.323 --> 09:17.725
RUSH: If there was
 anything still alive on
 this ship,

09:17.758 --> 09:18.992
the Kino
 would've noticed it.

09:24.064 --> 09:25.498
YOUNG: Is that
 a control panel?

09:40.748 --> 09:42.750
(HUMMING)

09:57.631 --> 09:58.966
Are you getting this?

10:00.133 --> 10:03.103
Uh, yeah, yeah,
 we got it.

10:03.136 --> 10:04.638
What is that,
a control room?

10:04.672 --> 10:06.606
Some kind of
 engineering station.

10:06.640 --> 10:09.777
It appears to only
 have limited control,

10:09.810 --> 10:12.112
but I think I can seal off
 some other bulkheads and...

10:12.145 --> 10:13.714
(POWER SURGES)

10:17.851 --> 10:20.788
We have life support.

10:20.821 --> 10:22.723
Power's coming on
 in other parts
 of the ship as well.

10:27.728 --> 10:29.763
Right.

10:29.797 --> 10:32.332
I'm going to
 try switching over
 to the ship's communications.

10:35.736 --> 10:37.004
Do you read?

10:37.037 --> 10:38.638
BRODY: Loud and clear.

10:38.672 --> 10:40.507
Okay, I'm also going to...

10:47.014 --> 10:49.516
What the hell
 just happened?

10:49.549 --> 10:51.151
I don't know.
 The engines have engaged.

10:51.184 --> 10:52.720
What did you do?
 I didn't do anything!

10:52.753 --> 10:53.987
Turn them off!

10:54.021 --> 10:55.388
I can't from here!

11:02.029 --> 11:03.596
The engines have
 shut off on their own.

11:04.698 --> 11:07.500
The power's nearly drained.

11:07.534 --> 11:11.504
Doesn't matter.
 We're ballistic,
 moving away from Destiny.

11:11.538 --> 11:12.472
Turn us around, Rush.

11:12.505 --> 11:14.374
I can't.

11:14.407 --> 11:15.776
Navigation and propulsion
 cannot be controlled
 from here.

11:27.087 --> 11:28.388
No power at all?

11:28.421 --> 11:30.557
Emergency reserves.

11:30.590 --> 11:32.659
The ship's systems
 took too much damage.

11:32.692 --> 11:33.794
YOUNG: If we can't
 turn this thing around,

11:33.827 --> 11:34.762
we're going to have to
 find another solution.

11:34.795 --> 11:37.397
Well, there's not much
 we can do from here.

11:37.430 --> 11:41.869
Without control
of Destiny core systems,
we can't steer back to you.

11:41.902 --> 11:44.772
Maybe Destiny will realize
there's a problem
and turn around on its own.

11:44.805 --> 11:47.908
We can't take a chance
 on something that
 may or may not happen.

11:53.781 --> 11:55.682
What?
 I don't know.

11:55.715 --> 11:56.784
You tell me.

12:02.655 --> 12:05.225
I've been doing some work,

12:05.258 --> 12:09.429
writing a program which would
 allow me to override
 Destiny' autopilot

12:09.462 --> 12:11.731
and manually fire the ship's
 maneuvering thrusters.

12:11.765 --> 12:14.734
You what?
 Why didn't you tell
 any of us?

12:14.768 --> 12:18.038
Because I haven't been
 successful as yet.
 It's extremely complex.

12:18.071 --> 12:21.208
Destiny's command programming
 is not something that
 can be easily manipulated.

12:21.241 --> 12:24.144
Okay, so fill me in.
 I can help with it.

12:24.177 --> 12:26.613
No! Uh...
 Well, I mean,
 yes, of course.

12:26.646 --> 12:29.783
You and the others can handle
 some of it, but most of it,

12:29.817 --> 12:32.152
that's going to
 require someone
 with a far greater knowledge

12:32.185 --> 12:33.586
of Ancient drive systems.

12:33.620 --> 12:35.122
Someone such as...

12:38.691 --> 12:40.127
Amanda Perry.
 She could do it.

12:42.095 --> 12:45.598
All right,
let's bring her on board.

12:45.632 --> 12:47.600
VOLKER:
 The suits consume power
 while wearing them.

12:47.634 --> 12:49.036
You might want to
 get out of them.

12:53.673 --> 12:54.842
(KNOCKING)

13:01.214 --> 13:03.851
Nice room.
 It's bigger
 than mine.

13:04.885 --> 13:05.953
What do you want?

13:05.986 --> 13:06.820
Can I come in?

13:11.291 --> 13:12.759
I hear you've been
 getting friendly

13:12.792 --> 13:14.027
with some of
 the people on the ship.

13:19.566 --> 13:23.103
The problem is when you get
 close to someone,

13:23.136 --> 13:25.973
you start letting
 your guard down,

13:26.006 --> 13:28.141
and then you say
 things you shouldn't.

13:30.577 --> 13:31.912
You haven't done that,
 have you?

13:34.848 --> 13:36.083
Oh. Excuse me.

13:38.218 --> 13:40.220
Uh, Ginn? We're all set,
 if you're ready.

13:42.589 --> 13:43.690
Ready for what?

13:45.725 --> 13:48.028
Nothing that concerns you.

14:05.946 --> 14:07.047
Are you okay with this?

14:07.080 --> 14:08.181
Yes.

14:08.215 --> 14:09.917
She's given her consent.

14:09.950 --> 14:12.785
She's fully aware of the
 communication stones protocol.

14:14.888 --> 14:17.057
I'm fine, Eli. Really.

14:24.197 --> 14:26.833
We may need you to
 remain on Earth

14:26.866 --> 14:29.336
until Dr. Perry is finished
 helping us with our problem.

14:29.369 --> 14:30.870
Is that all right with you?

14:33.706 --> 14:35.875
Just place
the stone on the device
when you're ready.

14:43.883 --> 14:45.118
See you soon.

14:52.792 --> 14:54.161
(DEVICE CHIMES)

15:04.837 --> 15:06.173
WRAY: Dr. Perry?

15:09.076 --> 15:10.277
Camile.

15:11.844 --> 15:14.081
Welcome aboard Destiny.

15:14.114 --> 15:15.983
Were they able to brief you
on our situation?

15:16.849 --> 15:17.985
Yes.

15:19.252 --> 15:20.120
Hello, Eli.

15:21.654 --> 15:22.655
Hi.

15:26.359 --> 15:28.261
RUSH: How are you getting on
 with those algorithms
 I gave you?

15:28.295 --> 15:29.929
BRODY OVER RADIO: Slow.

15:29.963 --> 15:31.999
And Dr. Park?

15:32.032 --> 15:33.433
She went to the
 engineering control room,
 like you told her.

15:33.466 --> 15:35.635
She'll radio you when
 she's got something,

15:35.668 --> 15:37.637
though she didn't
look too optimistic
when she left.

15:37.670 --> 15:39.639
Okay, how about Eli?

15:39.672 --> 15:42.009
Communications lab.
 He's getting Dr. Perry.

15:51.218 --> 15:54.354
Colonel, it seems
there's another
undamaged area of the ship.

15:54.387 --> 15:56.323
I've pressurized it.

15:56.356 --> 15:58.325
Might be worth
taking a look,

15:58.358 --> 16:00.293
see if there's a shuttle,
 escape pod,
 something like that.

16:02.462 --> 16:04.197
Keep me posted
on your progress.

16:04.231 --> 16:05.665
Of course.

16:18.911 --> 16:19.846
Nicholas?

16:21.048 --> 16:22.449
Mandy?

16:22.482 --> 16:26.319
Yes, I'm here.
 I can see you.
 Tell me what to do.

16:26.353 --> 16:27.987
Good, good.
 Is Eli with you?

16:28.021 --> 16:29.389
Yeah, I'm here.

16:29.422 --> 16:31.691
Good. Go help Dr. Park.

16:33.193 --> 16:34.694
What? Why?

16:34.727 --> 16:37.130
Because she's going to
 need you far more
 than Dr. Perry will.

16:37.164 --> 16:39.866
All right, all right.
 I'm going.

16:44.204 --> 16:45.338
Can you read this?

16:45.372 --> 16:47.974
Yes.

16:48.007 --> 16:51.078
Good. This is the first of
 several heuristic algorithms
 I need you to run.

16:51.111 --> 16:53.012
They're crucial to
 discovering a way

16:53.046 --> 16:54.181
to manually
 program an override

16:54.214 --> 16:56.216
Destiny's
 propulsion systems.

16:56.249 --> 16:58.385
First of several?

16:58.418 --> 17:00.853
And you thought this wasn't
 going to be any fun, huh?

17:00.887 --> 17:03.423
Yeah, very funny, Mr. Brody.
 Time is of the essence.

17:14.467 --> 17:15.968
Did you get it?

17:17.204 --> 17:18.871
Yeah, got it.

17:18.905 --> 17:21.241
Okay. Here's the next one.

17:26.079 --> 17:27.880
Rush, come in.

17:27.914 --> 17:29.449
RUSH OVER RADIO:
 Yes, Colonel.

17:29.482 --> 17:33.052
There's no sign of
 a shuttle or escape pod,

17:33.086 --> 17:36.356
and if there was,
 they probably used it
 to get the hell out of here.

17:36.389 --> 17:39.058
I'm going to check out
 a few more compartments,

17:39.092 --> 17:41.161
then I will head back.
 Young out.

18:14.127 --> 18:15.895
PERRY: Nicholas?

18:15.928 --> 18:17.964
Yes, Mandy?

18:17.997 --> 18:19.266
These heuristics
 you gave me...

18:19.299 --> 18:20.967
Do you understand them?
I think so.

18:23.303 --> 18:25.004
Are you asking me
 to go to...

18:25.037 --> 18:29.276
Yes. Now. Please.

18:37.484 --> 18:39.152
I'll be right back.

18:39.186 --> 18:40.953
BRODY: Need some help
 with something?

18:40.987 --> 18:44.123
No, thanks. I'll be fine.
 I'll let you know.

18:50.963 --> 18:52.031
We need to talk.

18:52.064 --> 18:53.866
I'm sorry?

18:53.900 --> 18:58.205
Oh, I'm not...
 I'm Dr. Amanda Perry.

18:58.238 --> 19:00.440
We used
 the communication stones?

19:00.473 --> 19:02.108
I was brought aboard
 to help with
 the current situation...

19:02.141 --> 19:03.443
Where's Ginn?

19:03.476 --> 19:04.877
She's on Earth.

19:06.246 --> 19:07.980
Look, I'm sorry,
 but I need to...

19:08.014 --> 19:08.948
No, no, no,
 we're not done here.

19:08.981 --> 19:10.016
GREER: Hey!

19:11.584 --> 19:14.020
Is there a problem?

19:14.053 --> 19:16.289
Sergeant,
I'm Dr. Amanda Perry.

19:16.323 --> 19:18.391
I used the stones
 to switch with Ginn.

19:18.425 --> 19:19.892
I heard.

19:21.428 --> 19:23.230
Welcome aboard.

19:23.263 --> 19:26.399
Thank you.
 Look, I've got quite a bit
 of work to do, and, uh...

19:26.433 --> 19:29.502
Then, by all means,
do not let
this man stop you.

19:29.536 --> 19:30.937
Thank you.

19:36.543 --> 19:37.877
Off you go now.

19:41.381 --> 19:43.015
That way.

20:47.580 --> 20:48.615
Nicholas?

20:48.648 --> 20:49.982
Mandy, are you there?

20:50.016 --> 20:51.618
Did you find it?
 Yes.

21:02.028 --> 21:02.762
BRODY OVER RADIO:
 Rush, come in.

21:02.795 --> 21:04.063
Yes, I'm here.

21:04.096 --> 21:05.832
We just lost the Kino feeds.

21:05.865 --> 21:09.669
Yeah, probably out of range.
 It was going to
 happen sooner or later.

21:09.702 --> 21:12.004
Don't worry about it.
 Just keep working.

21:13.540 --> 21:14.674
Mandy, are you still there?

21:14.707 --> 21:16.175
Yes, Nick.

21:16.208 --> 21:18.511
Good.
 This is a discreet channel.

21:18.545 --> 21:20.313
No one else on the ship
 can hear us.

21:21.381 --> 21:25.452
So this is the bridge.

21:25.485 --> 21:28.488
Indeed it is.
 Now we can
 finally get to work.

21:30.523 --> 21:32.124
What's going on
here, Nick?

21:32.158 --> 21:34.193
Oh, Mandy, I'm sorry
 for all the puzzles.

21:34.226 --> 21:36.996
I had to find a way of
 getting you on the bridge
 without anyone else knowing.

21:37.029 --> 21:38.130
Why the secrecy?

21:38.164 --> 21:39.666
Because I've done it.

21:39.699 --> 21:42.635
I've broken
 Destiny's master code.

21:42.669 --> 21:45.104
I now have complete control
 over all its systems.

21:45.137 --> 21:48.307
Wait a minute.
 You have control over
 navigation and propulsion?

21:48.341 --> 21:49.809
Yes, all of it.

21:49.842 --> 21:52.479
Then why do you need me?

21:52.512 --> 21:54.313
You could've had
 any of these people...

21:54.347 --> 21:58.184
I needed you because
 you're the only one
 I can trust.

21:58.217 --> 22:00.319
I can't tell the others.
 Not yet.

22:00.353 --> 22:01.888
Why not?
 Look, I'll explain in time.

22:01.921 --> 22:05.592
Right now, I need you to
 turn Destiny around
 and come and get us.

22:07.226 --> 22:10.029
All right.
Tell me what to do.

22:12.365 --> 22:13.566
We lost the Kino feed.

22:13.600 --> 22:14.667
Yeah, out of range.

22:16.536 --> 22:17.336
Where's Dr. Perry?

22:19.506 --> 22:21.040
I thought she was
 going to your lab.

22:23.275 --> 22:25.845
ELI OVER RADIO: Dr.
 Perry, do you read?

22:25.878 --> 22:28.347
Dr. Perry, please come in.

22:28.381 --> 22:30.316
Where are you?

22:30.349 --> 22:31.584
Nick, your friends
 are calling me.

22:31.618 --> 22:33.052
Don't answer. Not yet.

22:37.524 --> 22:38.691
(SIGHS)

22:38.725 --> 22:40.760
(ENGINES POWERING)

22:45.765 --> 22:49.268
Uh, guys?
 We're changing course.

22:49.301 --> 22:51.738
The Destiny just turned
 in the direction
 of the alien ship.

22:53.740 --> 22:55.408
PERRY: Okay,
 we're on our way.

22:56.743 --> 22:58.277
Well done, well done.

22:58.310 --> 23:00.713
So, what am I supposed
to tell the others?

23:00.747 --> 23:03.416
Tell them I sent you
 to the engine control room.

23:03.450 --> 23:06.553
You were able to enter
 the correct programming

23:06.586 --> 23:08.521
that allowed you to fire
the ship's
maneuvering thrusters.

23:08.555 --> 23:10.557
You're brilliant.
 They'll believe you.

23:10.590 --> 23:12.191
What is going on here, Nick?

23:12.224 --> 23:14.226
Why don't you want me
 to tell anyone the truth?

23:14.260 --> 23:16.463
Look, things have changed
 since you last
 came aboard this ship.

23:17.930 --> 23:19.799
You know me better
 than anyone, Mandy.

23:19.832 --> 23:23.135
Please believe me when I say
 I've got good reasons
 for this secrecy.

23:23.169 --> 23:24.737
ELI OVER RADIO:
 Dr. Perry, please respond.

23:24.771 --> 23:26.439
We really need
 to talk to you.

23:29.476 --> 23:31.277
We just need to know
 that you're okay.

23:37.784 --> 23:40.653
Yes, Eli. I'm fine.

23:40.687 --> 23:43.155
I am in
 the engine control room.

23:43.189 --> 23:48.427
I was able to execute
 Dr. Rush's
 programming override .

23:48.461 --> 23:51.498
Really?
 So you turned
 the ship around?

23:51.531 --> 23:54.834
Yes. I was able to
 manually fire
 the maneuvering thrusters.

23:57.436 --> 23:59.539
Wow. Okay.

24:00.873 --> 24:02.575
Do you need any help?

24:02.609 --> 24:04.577
I can come down, and...
 No, no, it's okay.

24:04.611 --> 24:06.613
I'm, uh,
 almost finished here.

24:06.646 --> 24:08.848
I should be coming back
 to the Control Room shortly.

24:10.650 --> 24:11.818
All right.

24:15.522 --> 24:17.490
What was she doing
 before she left?

24:17.524 --> 24:18.725
Working on the heuristics
 Rush gave her.

24:20.793 --> 24:23.462
She took her work with her.

24:35.474 --> 24:37.276
What?

24:37.309 --> 24:42.348
The Kino feed,
before we lost it?
I always record everything.

24:48.688 --> 24:49.689
Can you read this?

24:49.722 --> 24:51.891
PERRY: Yes.

24:51.924 --> 24:54.360
This is the first of
 several heuristic algorithms
 I need you to run.

24:55.662 --> 24:58.631
PERRY OVER RADIO:
 Well, so far, so good.

24:58.665 --> 25:01.568
My calculations put us
 at your doorstep
 within the hour.

25:01.601 --> 25:04.303
I knew it was a good idea
 getting you on board the ship.

25:04.336 --> 25:06.673
Well, you did say
 you'd find a way
 to bring me back aboard.

25:06.706 --> 25:08.541
(LAUGHS) I did at that.

25:33.766 --> 25:34.967
What the hell?

25:36.302 --> 25:37.870
Mandy, who's that?

25:37.904 --> 25:39.538
Rush?
 ELI: I don't believe this.

25:39.572 --> 25:40.707
You cracked
 Destiny's master code?

25:40.740 --> 25:42.441
RUSH: Eli, listen to me...

25:42.474 --> 25:45.411
You've had
 control of this ship
 the whole time?

25:45.444 --> 25:46.946
Why...
 Why wouldn't you tell any...

25:51.483 --> 25:54.621
Look, Colonel,
 I had every intention of...

25:54.654 --> 25:56.756
You broke the code?

25:56.789 --> 25:58.758
Yes.
 When?

25:58.791 --> 26:00.259
Does it matter?
When?

26:02.929 --> 26:05.698
Shortly after
the Lucian Alliance attack.

26:05.732 --> 26:07.399
I wanted to tell you,
 but I had to
 make sure I knew

26:07.433 --> 26:09.301
everything about this
before I let it... (GRUNTS)

26:09.335 --> 26:11.671
I should've killed you
 when I had the chance.

26:12.772 --> 26:15.341
(BOTH GRUNTING)

26:17.644 --> 26:20.613
Know what, it's your fault
 we lost the shuttle,
 that Riley's dead.

26:20.647 --> 26:21.748
Your fault!

26:34.861 --> 26:36.629
YOUNG: You murdered that boy!

26:43.435 --> 26:44.937
(GROANS)

26:52.645 --> 26:54.814
(BOTH PANTING)

27:20.639 --> 27:22.775
So, that's it?
That was your plan?

27:22.809 --> 27:24.811
Just keep this
 whole thing a secret?

27:24.844 --> 27:26.445
See how long
 you can get away with it?

27:26.478 --> 27:27.513
I had no choice.

27:27.546 --> 27:28.647
Yeah, you did.

27:28.681 --> 27:29.949
You could've told me, Rush.

27:29.982 --> 27:30.817
I couldn't
 trust you.

27:33.019 --> 27:36.488
I'm not the only one
who feels this way.

27:36.522 --> 27:37.656
Several of the crew
 have voiced their...

27:37.690 --> 27:39.391
It's all about control
 with you. Power...

27:39.425 --> 27:40.893
Well, someone's got
 to lead these people.

27:40.927 --> 27:42.661
You think anyone's gonna
 follow you after this?

27:42.695 --> 27:44.063
No, no, no, not me.

27:46.833 --> 27:47.767
But not you, either.

27:52.872 --> 27:55.742
Come on, Colonel,
 look at yourself.

27:55.775 --> 27:57.376
You can hardly
 get out of bed
 in the morning,

27:57.409 --> 27:59.145
never mind make
 command decisions.

27:59.178 --> 28:01.580
Wow, look at that.
 You got me
 all figured out, don't you?

28:01.613 --> 28:03.716
Well, anyone can see it.
 You know it's true.

28:06.853 --> 28:11.423
Look,
 when I unlocked the code,

28:11.457 --> 28:17.029
the amount of information
 it revealed was overwhelming.

28:17.063 --> 28:19.431
I had to make sure
 I had a proper handle
 on this stuff

28:19.465 --> 28:21.834
before letting anyone
 have access to it.

28:21.868 --> 28:24.170
If any one of those systems
 had been improperly handled...

28:24.203 --> 28:25.738
Resulting in
 the shuttle crashing,

28:25.772 --> 28:27.173
one of our best
 young men dying.

28:27.206 --> 28:28.741
You mean
 something like that?

28:34.080 --> 28:35.047
Yeah.

28:37.950 --> 28:39.418
I know I made mistakes.

28:52.832 --> 28:54.934
The simulation the ship
just put me through,

28:55.935 --> 28:57.804
was that
your doing as well?

28:57.837 --> 28:59.972
No, no, no, that was...
 That was the ship.

29:00.006 --> 29:01.007
Except the part at the end.

29:03.275 --> 29:08.447
I had to override the program
 to make Destiny
 jump back into FTL.

29:08.480 --> 29:10.082
Look, with all
 that's happened recently,

29:10.116 --> 29:12.618
the Lucian Alliance
 trying to take the ship,

29:12.651 --> 29:14.653
lives lost as
 a result of that,

29:17.489 --> 29:18.825
Lieutenant Johansen's baby...

29:23.762 --> 29:25.497
It's a heavy burden
 to carry, I know,

29:25.531 --> 29:28.500
but you have to ask
 yourself this question...

29:28.534 --> 29:32.171
"Am I fit to
 lead these people?"

29:32.204 --> 29:36.108
Well, maybe at one time,
 yeah, but not now.

29:38.144 --> 29:40.980
I couldn't tell you
 about the code, Colonel.

29:41.013 --> 29:43.115
How can I trust you
 when you don't even
 trust yourself?

29:50.689 --> 29:53.993
Rush, are you there?
 Rush, come in.

29:55.661 --> 29:56.829
Out of range?

29:57.864 --> 29:59.198
Probably shut off the radio.

30:00.166 --> 30:01.633
Why didn't you tell us?

30:04.036 --> 30:06.906
I'm sorry.
 I should have, I know.

30:08.340 --> 30:10.809
He was just so emphatic
about me keeping quiet.

30:10.843 --> 30:13.880
He said there
 was a good reason.

30:13.913 --> 30:15.514
Well, at least we're heading
 towards them now, right?

30:17.016 --> 30:19.218
If Rush is still alive
 when we get there.

30:22.688 --> 30:24.023
So, what happens now?

30:24.056 --> 30:26.792
Well, Destiny picks us up,
and then you
tell us everything

30:26.825 --> 30:29.295
that you've learned
 since breaking the code.

30:29.328 --> 30:31.830
Come on, you had to know
 that this game wasn't
 going to last forever.

30:31.864 --> 30:33.900
It's not a game, Colonel.

30:33.933 --> 30:36.035
Destiny's mission requires
 a level of commitment

30:36.068 --> 30:38.004
I doubt anyone on that ship
 is prepared to make.

30:38.037 --> 30:39.805
What mission?

30:39.838 --> 30:43.009
There is no mission
other than getting
these people home.

30:43.042 --> 30:45.577
You're wrong.

30:45.611 --> 30:48.014
It was never
 about going home.

30:48.047 --> 30:50.849
It's about getting us
 to where we're going.

30:50.883 --> 30:52.684
What the hell's
 that supposed to mean?

30:54.786 --> 30:56.188
You know,
 these past few weeks,

30:56.222 --> 30:58.857
I've learned so much
 more about the ship,

30:58.891 --> 31:00.826
about its mission.

31:00.859 --> 31:02.929
It's far more important
 than we ever thought.

31:04.396 --> 31:07.099
Okay, let's...
 Let's hear it.

31:07.133 --> 31:10.269
Are you familiar
 with the cosmic microwave
 background radiation?

31:10.302 --> 31:13.039
Noise left over
from the Big Bang.

31:13.072 --> 31:16.208
A long time ago,
 the Ancients made a discovery.

31:17.977 --> 31:20.246
They found evidence
 of a structure

31:20.279 --> 31:23.049
buried deep within
 the background radiation.

31:23.082 --> 31:26.919
They believed that at one time
 this structure had
 genuine complexity...

31:27.753 --> 31:30.289
Coherence.

31:30.322 --> 31:32.858
Therefore, it could not
 have occurred naturally.

31:32.891 --> 31:35.061
How is that
 even possible?

31:35.094 --> 31:38.064
It's not, at least not
 according to our current
 understanding of physics,

31:38.097 --> 31:41.133
nor could we even see
 this structure
 with our technology.

31:41.167 --> 31:45.737
Okay, so,
 what are we talking about,
 some kind of code? A message?

31:45.771 --> 31:49.808
A message, perhaps,
 or a sign of intelligence

31:49.841 --> 31:51.377
from the beginning of time.

31:51.410 --> 31:55.047
Sent by?
 Hmm.

31:55.081 --> 31:58.250
Well, that's the very question
 they sought to answer
 when they launched Destiny.

31:58.284 --> 32:01.753
That is the mission.

32:01.787 --> 32:07.059
We're talking about
 a mystery rooted in
 the foundation of reality.

32:07.093 --> 32:12.064
A puzzle with pieces scattered
 across the length and breadth
 of the universe itself.

32:12.098 --> 32:14.000
I swear to God, Rush,
 if this is another
 one of your hoaxes...

32:14.033 --> 32:18.270
Once I'd broken the code,
 I had access to
 the ship's complete archive.

32:18.304 --> 32:21.273
There are thousands
 of pages devoted to this,

32:21.307 --> 32:23.942
scientific research,
 philosophical debate...

32:23.976 --> 32:26.778
If we don't
have the technology
to see this thing,

32:26.812 --> 32:28.014
how the hell am I
 supposed to believe...

32:28.047 --> 32:30.682
Because Destiny is not
 our technology, Colonel.

32:30.716 --> 32:33.319
The Ancients
 left us their data
 as well as their ship.

32:33.352 --> 32:34.186
And you've seen this data?

32:36.055 --> 32:39.425
I'll show it to you.

32:39.458 --> 32:41.693
I don't promise
 you're going to understand it,
 but it's there.

32:44.063 --> 32:46.332
Someone's got to see
 this mission through.

32:46.365 --> 32:47.866
We're here.
 Why not us?

32:49.501 --> 32:52.438
Stop saying
 we don't belong
 on that ship.

32:52.471 --> 32:55.307
Embrace it. Move forward,
 stop looking behind us.

32:55.341 --> 32:57.443
I just want to get
 these people home.

32:57.476 --> 33:00.179
Well, I'm starting to think
 that seeing this
 mission through

33:00.212 --> 33:02.014
may be our only chance
 of ever doing that.

33:02.048 --> 33:03.315
But what does
that even mean?

33:03.349 --> 33:05.451
We're talking about
 a level of order

33:05.484 --> 33:07.719
present at
 the very beginning
 of space-time

33:07.753 --> 33:10.989
that goes beyond anything
 we ever conceived.

33:11.023 --> 33:12.858
I believe that
 the more we learn,

33:12.891 --> 33:15.394
the more pieces
 Destiny uncovers,

33:15.427 --> 33:18.830
then the greater our power
 to control everything
 around us will be.

33:18.864 --> 33:19.998
So it is about power.

33:20.032 --> 33:21.700
Yes, Colonel.

33:21.733 --> 33:24.236
The power to change things,

33:24.270 --> 33:27.973
control our fate,
 right the wrongs.

33:28.006 --> 33:30.342
To play God?
 No...

33:30.376 --> 33:32.311
To gain greater
 understanding...

33:32.344 --> 33:33.312
What the hell do
 you want from me?

33:33.345 --> 33:36.082
I want you to work with me,

33:36.115 --> 33:39.085
together, side by side,
 for the benefit of everyone.

33:41.019 --> 33:46.358
Well, it'd be
a hell of lot easier if you
stopped keeping secrets.

33:46.392 --> 33:48.927
It's fair to say
 we've had our differences,
 but that ends today.

33:52.098 --> 33:54.166
You have my word.

33:54.200 --> 33:57.469
(LAUGHS) Oh, man,
 you are a lot of work.

34:04.243 --> 34:07.246
Radio. Radio, let's go.

34:09.981 --> 34:10.849
RUSH OVER RADIO: Mandy?

34:10.882 --> 34:13.418
Yes, Nick, we're here.
 What happened?

34:13.452 --> 34:15.387
No, we're fine,
 but your angle
 and speed are off.

34:15.420 --> 34:19.558
I need you to circle back,
 line up Destiny's airlock as
 close to the ship as possible.

34:19.591 --> 34:21.193
Where's Colonel Young?

34:21.226 --> 34:23.195
YOUNG: Eli, I'm here.
 We're going to sort
 all of this out later.

34:23.228 --> 34:25.030
Let's just get us
 back on board first.

34:25.063 --> 34:26.264
We should get
 back in the suits.

34:35.574 --> 34:36.942
Try not to
 come in so sharply.

34:36.975 --> 34:38.310
Yeah, you just want
to pull alongside.

34:38.344 --> 34:39.411
Maybe Brody
 should be driving.
 No offense...

34:39.445 --> 34:40.911
Just shut up!
Okay.

34:49.321 --> 34:51.556
Easy, easy.
 Keep an eye on your starboard.

34:51.590 --> 34:53.259
Watch your angle...
 SCOTT: What the hell's
 going on here?

34:53.292 --> 34:54.893
No time.
 There's no time.

34:54.926 --> 34:56.495
You've got to ease up.
 That's very sensitive.

34:56.527 --> 34:58.096
ELI:
 Back off as you come in...
Is she flying the ship?

34:58.130 --> 34:59.298
Do you know what you're doing?
 Guys!

34:59.331 --> 35:00.332
Not now!

35:05.204 --> 35:07.573
RUSH: Kino's damaged.

35:07.606 --> 35:11.443
I won't be able to use it
 to take us back to the ship.

35:11.477 --> 35:14.580
YOUNG: Well, there's
 another one in search mode
 somewhere still on the ship.

35:14.613 --> 35:16.182
If we can find it.

35:18.150 --> 35:19.185
Reverse! You're too close!

35:19.951 --> 35:20.986
I'm trying!

35:36.168 --> 35:37.035
YOUNG:
 What the hell just happened?

35:38.237 --> 35:40.206
I'm sorry, Colonel.

35:40.239 --> 35:42.641
We came in too close.
 Maybe I should give it a try.

35:42.674 --> 35:44.843
BRODY: No, no, no, we're okay.

35:44.876 --> 35:46.978
We've matched their speed.

35:47.012 --> 35:49.548
Yeah, but how the hell
 are we going to
 get them off of that ship?

35:52.684 --> 35:55.053
PERRY OVER RADIO:
 Nick, are you all right?

35:55.086 --> 35:57.923
RUSH: I'm okay.
 The rotation's slow enough.

36:04.196 --> 36:07.999
YOUNG:
 We've got a bigger problem.
 The Kino is damaged.

36:08.033 --> 36:11.403
We're not going to be able
 to use it to
 get back on the ship.

36:11.437 --> 36:12.471
What about the other one?

36:12.504 --> 36:14.206
RUSH: It's lost...

36:14.240 --> 36:15.507
Somewhere on the ship.

36:15.541 --> 36:17.142
They don't have time
 to go looking for it.

36:17.175 --> 36:19.044
Are you back in
 the space suits?
 Yeah.

36:19.077 --> 36:22.214
ELI: Okay, good.
 So this is easy.

36:22.248 --> 36:23.915
You're just going
 to use the ship's
 centripetal force

36:23.949 --> 36:25.351
to propel you
 the distance.

36:25.384 --> 36:27.653
Easy? That ship's
 just not spinning,
 it's wobbling.

36:27.686 --> 36:29.588
You'll have to calculate
 each jump separately.

36:29.621 --> 36:32.023
The speed of rotation,
 the mass of each person,

36:32.057 --> 36:33.359
the angle of trajectory...
 I'm already on it.

36:33.392 --> 36:35.227
Eli, if they miss the ship...

36:35.261 --> 36:36.462
They won't.

36:42.234 --> 36:44.503
YOUNG: We're making our way
 to the opening in the hull.

36:44.536 --> 36:47.273
RUSH: Eli, how are you coming
 with the calculations?

36:47.306 --> 36:49.608
I've got your jump worked out,
 so you'll go first.

36:49.641 --> 36:51.076
I'm almost done
 with Colonel Young's.

36:51.109 --> 36:52.110
You have to release
 when I say,

36:52.143 --> 36:54.413
the exact moment,
 don't hesitate.

37:00.051 --> 37:01.653
RUSH: Okay, I'm in position.

37:03.054 --> 37:03.989
Tell me when.

37:05.391 --> 37:06.558
Ready?

37:08.394 --> 37:09.428
Now!

37:22.107 --> 37:24.009
ELI: Engage your mag boots!

37:32.351 --> 37:34.252
RUSH: Destiny, I'm on board.

37:34.286 --> 37:37.055
ELI: Okay.
 Okay, I got this.

37:37.088 --> 37:38.990
Colonel, are you ready?

37:39.024 --> 37:40.726
Yeah.
 ELI: Okay.

37:40.759 --> 37:42.193
Get ready to release.

37:45.130 --> 37:45.964
Now!

37:55.307 --> 37:56.975
RUSH: His angle is off!

38:00.612 --> 38:01.980
BRODY: He jumped too early.

38:51.697 --> 38:55.667
ELI: It's ridiculous,
 the amount of
 information here.

38:55.701 --> 38:58.203
Just keep looking
 for that message.

38:58.236 --> 39:00.372
BRODY: Colonel, we've got
 an opportunity ahead.

39:00.406 --> 39:04.743
Several planets in range.
 Looks pretty good.

39:04.776 --> 39:07.746
All right.
 Let's see
 if this works.

39:31.903 --> 39:33.271
Hey.

39:33.304 --> 39:34.773
Hi.

39:34.806 --> 39:36.708
Compliments of
Mr. Brody's still.

39:36.742 --> 39:38.376
(CHUCKLES)

39:38.410 --> 39:42.080
Oh, how I've missed
its lone
redeeming quality.

39:47.653 --> 39:49.588
How's the crew?

39:51.289 --> 39:55.527
Angry, but the truth
 is out now,

39:55.561 --> 39:57.796
so that can only
 be a good thing.

40:00.265 --> 40:03.535
And, uh, Colonel Young?

40:03.569 --> 40:06.805
I know you didn't
 trust him before.
 Can you trust him now?

40:09.407 --> 40:10.442
I've got no choice.

40:13.445 --> 40:14.680
Here, cheers.

40:24.590 --> 40:26.725
I'm sorry, Mandy.

40:26.758 --> 40:28.193
I know I put you in
 a very difficult position.

40:30.195 --> 40:33.431
It's okay.
 In fact, I'm flattered.

40:35.166 --> 40:37.168
Of all people,
 you chose to confide in me.

40:39.204 --> 40:40.338
Well, of course.

40:42.474 --> 40:44.175
You're the finest person
 I know.

40:48.714 --> 40:53.819
I've thought a lot about you,
 about seeing you again.

40:55.654 --> 40:57.523
Me, too.

40:57.556 --> 40:58.890
This time...

41:00.391 --> 41:01.727
This time is different.

41:07.465 --> 41:09.701
Colonel Young wants to
 see you on the bridge.

41:09.735 --> 41:11.469
Can it wait?

41:11.503 --> 41:13.639
No, he said to come now.
 It's urgent.

41:13.672 --> 41:14.840
I'll be back soon.

41:22.848 --> 41:25.817
You know,
 sometimes, with the stones,

41:25.851 --> 41:28.754
it's easy to forget
 you're in
 another person's body.

43:26.805 --> 43:27.773
