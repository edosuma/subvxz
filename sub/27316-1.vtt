00:54.376 --> 00:57.543
(electronic bleeping)

01:09.442 --> 01:10.690
- Are you?

01:10.690 --> 01:13.500
- [Dynastud] Are you my contact?

01:13.500 --> 01:15.963
- Depends on who is asking.

01:17.210 --> 01:18.410
- [Dynastud] I'm asking.

01:20.060 --> 01:21.660
And that's all you need to know.

01:24.700 --> 01:26.190
- My name is--

01:26.190 --> 01:27.290
- Is Fredrich Gerlich.

01:29.340 --> 01:31.190
And I meant what I said on the phone.

01:37.020 --> 01:38.223
I am the best.

01:40.350 --> 01:42.020
- I can see that.

01:42.020 --> 01:44.146
- Leave the money on the table.

01:44.146 --> 01:48.229
(light melodic electronic music)

02:04.098 --> 02:06.681
(wind howling)

02:11.370 --> 02:13.010
Which one do you want?

02:13.010 --> 02:14.900
- And welcome back to the 2024

02:14.900 --> 02:16.740
Republican Presidential Debates,

02:16.740 --> 02:19.150
brought to you by our
sponsor, Crystal Clear,

02:19.150 --> 02:21.413
America's leading coal
refining organization.

02:22.703 --> 02:24.786
(groans)

02:25.704 --> 02:26.537
(softly chuckles)

02:26.537 --> 02:27.886
- Is this your first time?

02:27.886 --> 02:28.970
(speaking foreign language)

02:28.970 --> 02:31.127
- Why would you think that?

02:31.127 --> 02:33.470
My organization has bought many

02:33.470 --> 02:35.980
of your politicians in the past.

02:35.980 --> 02:37.490
- Well, then.

02:37.490 --> 02:39.283
You must have a lot of experience.

02:40.400 --> 02:42.313
And if you don't, that's okay.

02:43.788 --> 02:44.623
I don't judge.

02:45.980 --> 02:46.963
I have my money,

02:47.879 --> 02:51.780
and I can take it nice and slow.

02:51.780 --> 02:54.080
- [Kelly] We are here in one
of Crystal Clear's mines,

02:54.080 --> 02:55.770
800 feet below ground,

02:55.770 --> 02:57.350
with our top three candidates.

02:57.350 --> 03:00.663
And tonight's debate will
decide who will get the nod.

03:01.640 --> 03:03.040
What should we, as a nation, do

03:03.040 --> 03:05.140
about the homosexual menace?

03:05.140 --> 03:07.704
Let's start with Governor Gary McMan.

03:07.704 --> 03:08.810
- In the last eight years,

03:08.810 --> 03:11.040
we have finally moved out of the dark ages

03:11.040 --> 03:13.950
of tolerance and diversity.

03:13.950 --> 03:17.180
Homosexuals are no longer allowed to taint

03:17.180 --> 03:19.650
the sacred bond of marriage,

03:19.650 --> 03:21.190
nor are they allowed to be employed

03:21.190 --> 03:23.940
as teachers or serve in our military.

03:23.940 --> 03:28.430
And now, with Directive 48 in place,

03:28.430 --> 03:32.230
sodomy is now a criminal offense.

03:32.230 --> 03:33.793
Punishable by death.

03:34.750 --> 03:38.493
But because this is a Christian nation,

03:39.380 --> 03:42.560
I believe that's enough
punishment for these poor devils.

03:42.560 --> 03:46.720
So, I say, keep the laws as they stand.

03:46.720 --> 03:48.340
- Neither that one.

03:48.340 --> 03:50.170
He appears to have the intelligence

03:50.170 --> 03:51.993
of a Belgian peanut farmer.

03:52.910 --> 03:55.000
- And same question to
Congressman Kellogg,

03:55.000 --> 03:56.070
and that's a mighty fine hat

03:56.070 --> 03:57.300
you're wearing there, Congressman.

03:57.300 --> 03:58.630
- Well, shoot.

03:58.630 --> 03:59.927
Thank you there, Kelly.

03:59.927 --> 04:01.580
(chuckles)

04:01.580 --> 04:04.793
Now, I must echo the words
of my good friend, Gary.

04:05.690 --> 04:07.420
We are a Christian nation,

04:07.420 --> 04:10.940
so we need to show mercy
on these poor bastards,

04:10.940 --> 04:14.780
but if they obey the law, then maybe,

04:14.780 --> 04:17.760
just maybe we can help
these poor son of a bitches

04:17.760 --> 04:21.070
rejoin society eventually,

04:21.070 --> 04:22.680
but not in my neighborhood.

04:22.680 --> 04:23.513
- No, no.

04:25.270 --> 04:27.563
He reminds too much of my father.

04:29.140 --> 04:31.660
He was a raper of sheep!

04:31.660 --> 04:34.043
- And finally, to Senator Teddy Hightower.

04:36.440 --> 04:39.083
- These two fuckin' guys
are queer for each other.

04:40.885 --> 04:42.891
(gun shot booming)

04:42.891 --> 04:43.724
(gasping)

04:43.724 --> 04:45.500
(gun shot booming)

04:45.500 --> 04:47.510
And that's my answer for what we should do

04:47.510 --> 04:49.910
about the homosexual
menace in this country.

04:49.910 --> 04:51.363
- How about that one?

04:53.370 --> 04:55.470
He looks a reptile!

04:55.470 --> 04:56.513
- Teddy Hightower.

04:58.550 --> 04:59.863
Excellent choice.

05:03.890 --> 05:04.723
Now,

05:05.660 --> 05:06.660
shall we

05:09.040 --> 05:10.063
seal the deal?

05:12.240 --> 05:14.283
- How do we do that?

05:14.283 --> 05:15.228
(intense music)

05:15.228 --> 05:16.130
(gasps)

05:16.130 --> 05:17.490
- Like this.

05:17.490 --> 05:19.310
- How did you do that?

05:23.486 --> 05:25.819
(smooching)

05:28.310 --> 05:29.910
- Now.

05:29.910 --> 05:32.873
I want to see that two
bit tux hit the floor.

05:32.873 --> 05:35.273
(intense melodic rock music)

05:35.273 --> 05:40.273
(belt whipping))

05:41.781 --> 05:44.781
(zipper scratching)

05:50.474 --> 05:52.815
(grunting)

05:52.815 --> 05:54.065
Take it, bitch.

05:54.920 --> 05:55.980
Here I come!

05:57.451 --> 05:58.284
(squishy explosion splattering)

05:58.284 --> 06:01.867
(eerie suspenseful music)

06:20.690 --> 06:22.740
Mission accomplished.

06:22.740 --> 06:24.173
Please send next assignment.

06:30.770 --> 06:32.120
Room service!

06:32.120 --> 06:33.890
Could you please send up a maid?

06:33.890 --> 06:36.270
I know they're not due until morning,

06:36.270 --> 06:39.020
but this one mess, I'm sure,

06:39.020 --> 06:41.534
they're gonna want a headstart on.

09:55.580 --> 09:56.623
It's you.

09:58.560 --> 10:00.240
You want a blue pin.

10:00.240 --> 10:01.073
- That's right.

10:01.073 --> 10:02.583
Please, call me Bart.

10:04.730 --> 10:08.050
- You let me know when
you decide to try red.

10:08.050 --> 10:09.060
Got me?

10:09.060 --> 10:11.878
- Oh, you'll be the first to know, Zelda.

10:11.878 --> 10:13.988
(giggling)

10:13.988 --> 10:16.738
(softly moaning)

10:25.980 --> 10:26.870
- What are ya havin', Bart?

10:26.870 --> 10:28.040
- [Bart] Vodka soda.

10:28.040 --> 10:31.860
- I'll get that for ya, boy.

10:31.860 --> 10:32.760
- Comin' right up.

10:34.810 --> 10:36.350
- Thank you very much, sir.

10:36.350 --> 10:37.293
That's very kind.

10:38.380 --> 10:41.083
- Anything for a cute
little guy like you, sailor.

10:42.730 --> 10:43.693
- My name is Bart.

10:45.740 --> 10:48.160
- I haven't seen you here before.

10:48.160 --> 10:50.923
you come here often, Bart?

10:52.480 --> 10:53.963
- Not as often as I like.

10:58.580 --> 10:59.730
- I've come here often.

11:00.910 --> 11:03.460
You want to join me in the back room?

11:03.460 --> 11:05.193
Help me come again?

11:11.281 --> 11:13.448
(panting)

11:15.080 --> 11:16.391
- You're so hot.

11:16.391 --> 11:18.641
(laughing)

11:21.847 --> 11:22.780
(moaning)

11:22.780 --> 11:24.180
- You want this?

11:24.180 --> 11:25.013
- Yeah.

11:26.390 --> 11:28.113
- [Man] It's all yours, boy.

11:29.128 --> 11:32.295
(moaning and panting)

11:36.812 --> 11:39.062
(laughing)

11:43.478 --> 11:46.040
- Ah, it's just with my daughter.

11:46.040 --> 11:48.010
It is so stupid.

11:48.010 --> 11:50.150
She can't keep her panties on!

11:50.150 --> 11:52.660
She'll fuck any guy that
looks at her cross-eyed.

11:52.660 --> 11:54.580
She has no concept of the reality

11:54.580 --> 11:56.010
that this will make me look bad

11:56.010 --> 11:57.630
right before the election!

11:57.630 --> 12:00.220
- You better lock that
down before she gets prego.

12:00.220 --> 12:02.240
- Don't you think I know that?

12:02.240 --> 12:04.670
I have to find some way
to get Patty married off

12:04.670 --> 12:06.650
before she gets knocked up.

12:06.650 --> 12:08.320
- Is it really that big a deal?

12:08.320 --> 12:10.000
- Yes, it is.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.810
She's fucked two of the gardeners,

12:11.810 --> 12:13.440
done anal with my accountant,

12:13.440 --> 12:15.210
laid the Utah Jazz,

12:15.210 --> 12:17.540
and Friday, she blew the chauffer.

12:17.540 --> 12:19.060
- Blew the chauffer?

12:19.060 --> 12:21.060
That's just bad taste.

12:21.060 --> 12:21.893
- Poor girl.

12:21.893 --> 12:23.850
She's just too easily led.

12:23.850 --> 12:25.890
She can't walk out the
door without accidentally

12:25.890 --> 12:28.430
catching a random panoply of dicks.

12:28.430 --> 12:30.430
And worse, she likes it.

12:30.430 --> 12:32.863
- And honestly, she's
not even that good at it.

12:34.910 --> 12:37.108
- Did you fuck my daughter, too?

12:37.108 --> 12:38.689
(stammering)

12:38.689 --> 12:39.700
- No!

12:39.700 --> 12:43.090
I mean, I thought you knew!

12:44.957 --> 12:47.960
(gun shot booming)

12:47.960 --> 12:50.540
- For God's sakes, you can't trust anyone

12:50.540 --> 12:52.390
not to butter your daughter's muffin.

12:53.490 --> 12:54.387
You didn't fuck her, did you?

12:54.387 --> 12:56.360
- No, no, no, not a chance.

12:56.360 --> 12:57.530
- Good.

12:57.530 --> 12:59.610
Then you can give me some advice.

12:59.610 --> 13:01.830
- Advice?
- Yes.

13:01.830 --> 13:04.460
How do I find a man to marry my daughter?

13:04.460 --> 13:07.080
Someone I can control.

13:07.080 --> 13:08.620
- Why don't you just pay a guy?

13:08.620 --> 13:10.660
- Common gigolo for my daughter?

13:10.660 --> 13:12.050
I don't think so.

13:12.050 --> 13:14.370
Besides, once those guys
get a taste of money,

13:14.370 --> 13:16.180
they won't be stopped.

13:16.180 --> 13:21.113
No, I need someone dumb and unambitious.

13:22.160 --> 13:23.360
- What about a prisoner?

13:24.210 --> 13:26.880
You let them go, they owe you everything.

13:26.880 --> 13:30.760
Plus, built-in blackmail.

13:30.760 --> 13:31.943
- Prisoner, huh?

13:32.850 --> 13:35.603
That idea has promise.

13:37.954 --> 13:40.371
(snickering)

13:41.500 --> 13:42.580
- Yes!

13:42.580 --> 13:43.487
Yes!

13:43.487 --> 13:45.290
Ah, there's the magic!

13:45.290 --> 13:46.692
Yeah!

13:46.692 --> 13:47.940
(raspy panting)

13:47.940 --> 13:49.570
- [Bart] Hey, do you want me to swallow?

13:49.570 --> 13:50.970
- No!

13:50.970 --> 13:52.590
Get it all over your face!

13:52.590 --> 13:54.458
Oh, I'm gonna shoot!

13:54.458 --> 13:56.708
(groaning)

14:00.724 --> 14:02.242
Yeah.

14:02.242 --> 14:03.760
(panting)

14:03.760 --> 14:05.310
- [Bart] Was that good for you?

14:07.330 --> 14:10.370
- Kid, you're under arrest.

14:10.370 --> 14:13.552
The evidence is all over ya.

14:13.552 --> 14:16.112
(laughing)

14:16.112 --> 14:19.612
(camera shutter clicking)

14:21.650 --> 14:22.750
- You want me to what?!

14:22.750 --> 14:25.459
- My daughter needs a husband.

14:25.459 --> 14:26.833
A man to keep her in line.

14:27.860 --> 14:30.973
You're familiar with Ephesians 5:22?

14:32.207 --> 14:35.050
- "Thou shalt not covet
thy neighbor's ass?"

14:35.050 --> 14:36.660
- No.

14:36.660 --> 14:39.537
It's, "Wives, submit
yourselves to your own husbands

14:39.537 --> 14:41.490
"as you do to the Lord."

14:41.490 --> 14:42.930
- Yeah, I'm a flibberty-jibbit.

14:42.930 --> 14:45.610
- Shut your hole, Patty, daddy's talking.

14:45.610 --> 14:48.843
You see, she needs a man's
hand to keep her in line.

14:51.373 --> 14:53.970
(gun shot booming)
(gasping)

14:53.970 --> 14:56.020
(gun shot booming)
(gasping)

14:56.020 --> 14:57.890
Don't flinch!

14:57.890 --> 15:00.890
My daughter is not going
to marry a flincher!

15:00.890 --> 15:03.160
- What Senator Hightower's trying to say

15:03.160 --> 15:04.360
is that he would like you enter

15:04.360 --> 15:07.320
into a marriage contract
with his daughter.

15:07.320 --> 15:10.596
And in return, your criminal
record will be sealed.

15:10.596 --> 15:11.660
- Sealed?

15:11.660 --> 15:14.070
- Yes, legal proceedings
against you would cease

15:14.070 --> 15:16.430
for as long as you remain under contract.

15:16.430 --> 15:19.120
Otherwise, I'm sure you understand.

15:19.120 --> 15:20.230
You will face confinement,

15:20.230 --> 15:21.940
followed by a painful execution

15:21.940 --> 15:24.890
for your salacious crimes
against humanity and God.

15:24.890 --> 15:27.570
- Well, I don't know if I
want to marry a God criminal!

15:27.570 --> 15:30.650
- Silence, Patty, or no pumpkin spice.

15:30.650 --> 15:33.150
- Ah beans, I never get to say nothin'!

15:34.098 --> 15:35.610
(cooing)

15:35.610 --> 15:36.630
Yes!

15:36.630 --> 15:38.710
- The contract will be absolutely binding.

15:38.710 --> 15:40.890
You will remain married
until you produce an heir

15:40.890 --> 15:42.910
and for 11 years after that.

15:42.910 --> 15:46.480
Then you are free to pursue
your own arrangements.

15:46.480 --> 15:49.380
And in the meantime, everything
will be provided for.

15:49.380 --> 15:51.760
You'll live in a fancy
mansion with your new wife,

15:51.760 --> 15:53.520
have people to cook and clean for you.

15:53.520 --> 15:54.620
- I already have that!

15:55.531 --> 15:58.310
- Cram up, pumpkin, this isn't about you.

15:58.310 --> 15:59.530
- What if I leave early?

15:59.530 --> 16:01.390
What if I break my contract?

16:01.390 --> 16:04.810
- Well, the MAGA Police
would pick you back up.

16:04.810 --> 16:07.720
But more than likely, I
would have you killed.

16:07.720 --> 16:08.553
- What?!

16:09.724 --> 16:11.891
(gun shot booming)
(shouts)

16:11.891 --> 16:13.613
(gun shot booming)
(shouts)

16:13.613 --> 16:15.530
You can't just kill me!

16:16.927 --> 16:17.875
(gun shot booming)

16:17.875 --> 16:19.875
(gasps)

16:26.231 --> 16:29.270
(giggling)

16:29.270 --> 16:31.620
- Tonight, I'm gonna fuck you so hard,

16:31.620 --> 16:34.373
I'm gonna break your dick off!

16:34.373 --> 16:36.623
(laughing)

16:43.630 --> 16:44.870
- Senator Hightower.

16:44.870 --> 16:48.220
- Bart, please, you're my son-in-law now.

16:48.220 --> 16:50.870
Call me Senator.

16:50.870 --> 16:53.240
- Alright, then.
- Now, tonight,

16:53.240 --> 16:54.720
I want you to fuck my daughter

16:54.720 --> 16:57.410
until she breaks your dick off.

16:57.410 --> 16:58.920
- Oh, daddy!

16:58.920 --> 17:01.258
- Welcome to the family, Bart!

17:01.258 --> 17:03.508
(laughing)

17:06.615 --> 17:08.948
(screaming)

17:10.574 --> 17:13.824
(gentle dreamy music)

17:19.428 --> 17:20.609
- Bart!

17:20.609 --> 17:22.357
I'm ready for your pecker now!

17:24.980 --> 17:26.220
- I love women.

17:26.220 --> 17:27.619
I love Patty.

17:27.619 --> 17:31.000
I love boobies, not men's
hard, throbbing cocks

17:31.000 --> 17:33.330
and tight butts and...

17:33.330 --> 17:34.650
This has gotta be normal!

17:34.650 --> 17:37.150
This has to be normal,
or I'm gonna be killed!

17:37.150 --> 17:39.890
Please, God, please,
let me get hard for her!

17:39.890 --> 17:40.723
- Bartholomew!

17:41.970 --> 17:45.440
I want you in my tunnel of love!

17:45.440 --> 17:49.530
It's sopping wet like a spongecake!

17:49.530 --> 17:51.716
- Well, now I'm completely flaccid.

17:51.716 --> 17:54.299
(gentle music)

17:57.611 --> 18:00.810
- Pumpkin, what are you doing in there

18:00.810 --> 18:03.093
while I'm out here?!

18:04.949 --> 18:06.040
(sighs)

18:06.040 --> 18:06.943
- I'm gonna die.

18:14.519 --> 18:16.103
(bushes rustling)

18:16.103 --> 18:18.770
(birds calling)

18:27.930 --> 18:29.133
(groans)

18:29.133 --> 18:31.756
Oh, my dick!

18:31.756 --> 18:33.923
(panting)

18:36.030 --> 18:38.280
(groaning)

18:45.482 --> 18:46.623
(gasps)

18:46.623 --> 18:50.040
(eerie electronic music)

18:59.530 --> 19:00.363
Hey.

19:02.710 --> 19:04.560
- Let me ask you a question.

19:04.560 --> 19:05.393
- Okay.

19:06.610 --> 19:07.523
- Can you fly?

19:08.730 --> 19:09.923
- Um, what?

19:11.340 --> 19:13.783
- [Dynastud] I said, can you fly?

19:15.030 --> 19:16.573
- Of course I can't fly.

19:18.890 --> 19:22.010
- Are you Bartholomew James Cooper

19:22.010 --> 19:25.250
of 91 Ridgeway Road,
Portsmouth, New Hampshire?

19:25.250 --> 19:26.930
- I am, but what are you?

19:26.930 --> 19:29.650
- Huh, it says here you can fly.

19:29.650 --> 19:30.773
It's even underlined.

19:32.450 --> 19:36.310
Well, do you have a slick motorcycle,

19:36.310 --> 19:38.420
or a badass muscle car,

19:38.420 --> 19:40.820
or something that we can
take off in style with?

19:41.972 --> 19:44.290
'Cause my car is in the shop.

19:44.290 --> 19:46.650
Well, actually, it was repossessed.

19:46.650 --> 19:48.510
- Look, I'm kinda in a hurry and all,

19:48.510 --> 19:51.590
and wait, did you say take off?

19:51.590 --> 19:53.350
You want me to go with you?

19:53.350 --> 19:54.810
- Indeed.

19:54.810 --> 19:55.890
- Why?

19:55.890 --> 19:57.250
- It's a long story.

19:57.250 --> 20:00.140
But I am an incredibly handsome

20:01.390 --> 20:03.313
and rugged man.

20:04.710 --> 20:06.600
And you are a flightless homosexual

20:07.693 --> 20:09.943
with what appears to be
a rock hard erection.

20:12.390 --> 20:13.890
What other reason do you need?

20:15.820 --> 20:17.970
- I just ate about 20 Viagra.

20:17.970 --> 20:19.220
- Well, point the way, old chum,

20:19.220 --> 20:21.791
'cause it looks like we're
hoofin' it from here.

20:21.791 --> 20:24.291
(light music)

20:25.858 --> 20:28.820
- Bartholomew!

20:28.820 --> 20:30.560
You haven't even been able

20:30.560 --> 20:33.223
to your P in my V yet!

20:42.297 --> 20:44.447
- [Gaydar] Hoo, girl,
there's danger ahead.

20:47.160 --> 20:49.110
- Sir, are you okay?

20:49.110 --> 20:50.670
- My Gaydar, it's going off.

20:50.670 --> 20:51.760
I can't control it.

20:51.760 --> 20:53.870
- [Gaydar] Sugar, we don't
have time for the sex position.

20:53.870 --> 20:55.760
We got bad guys to catch.

20:55.760 --> 20:56.593
- Gaydar?

20:56.593 --> 20:58.300
What's Gaydar?

20:58.300 --> 21:00.200
- It's one of my superpowers.

21:00.200 --> 21:03.110
- Wait, you have superpowers?

21:03.110 --> 21:04.760
- What kind?

21:04.760 --> 21:07.600
- Super hearing, super strength,

21:07.600 --> 21:08.920
among them is Gaydar,

21:08.920 --> 21:10.520
an internalized voice that alerts me

21:10.520 --> 21:12.400
to crimes against our kind.

21:12.400 --> 21:14.556
It's a great defense mechanism.

21:14.556 --> 21:16.060
It can also be bitchy.

21:16.060 --> 21:17.500
And give me migraines.

21:17.500 --> 21:19.060
- [Gaydar] But it can save my life.

21:19.060 --> 21:20.500
- Shut up, Gaydar.

21:20.500 --> 21:21.580
- [Gaydar] Whatevs.

21:21.580 --> 21:23.290
- That's wild.

21:23.290 --> 21:24.950
What other kind of abilities do you have?

21:24.950 --> 21:26.253
Do you have x-ray vision?

21:27.570 --> 21:31.080
(electronic bleeping)

21:31.080 --> 21:32.430
- No.

21:32.430 --> 21:34.180
- Well, can you fly?

21:34.180 --> 21:35.550
- Can't fly.

21:35.550 --> 21:37.493
But I can glide short distances.

21:38.700 --> 21:40.120
- Bitchin'.

21:40.120 --> 21:41.970
I want to help you.

21:41.970 --> 21:43.730
I feel like I'm supposed to be here,

21:43.730 --> 21:44.913
like it's my destiny!

21:47.610 --> 21:50.500
- All will be revealed in time, Bart.

21:50.500 --> 21:53.870
- I feel compelled to drop to my knees

21:53.870 --> 21:56.440
and pleasure you right now.

21:56.440 --> 21:58.313
- That happens, yeah.

21:59.590 --> 22:00.540
- What's your name?

22:02.320 --> 22:03.153
- Call me

22:06.470 --> 22:08.187
Dynastud.

22:08.187 --> 22:10.600
(zipper scratching)

22:10.600 --> 22:12.487
- You got it, Dynastud!

22:15.495 --> 22:16.813
(moaning)

22:16.813 --> 22:19.313
(light music)

22:21.390 --> 22:22.223
- Checkmate!

22:25.501 --> 22:26.857
- Huh.

22:26.857 --> 22:28.360
(laughing)

22:28.360 --> 22:29.399
Checkmate.

22:29.399 --> 22:31.649
(laughing)

22:33.617 --> 22:36.330
(gun shot booming)

22:36.330 --> 22:37.183
Jarvis!

22:38.870 --> 22:40.230
It's time for my tea.

22:40.230 --> 22:41.350
- Yes, sir.

22:41.350 --> 22:44.980
- Oh, and uh, clean this shit up.

22:44.980 --> 22:46.050
- Yes, Senator.

22:46.050 --> 22:48.520
Your daughter just arrived
and wishes to see you.

22:48.520 --> 22:50.020
- Patty?

22:50.020 --> 22:52.310
But it's the first day of her honeymoon!

22:52.310 --> 22:54.350
(sobbing)

22:54.350 --> 22:55.183
- Daddy!

22:56.460 --> 22:58.450
- Princess!

22:58.450 --> 23:01.244
What did that little cocksucker do to you?

23:01.244 --> 23:03.411
(sobbing)

23:05.165 --> 23:06.655
- Don't touch me!

23:06.655 --> 23:08.822
(sobbing)

23:10.870 --> 23:11.920
- Wait.

23:11.920 --> 23:13.000
(bushes rustling)

23:13.000 --> 23:13.870
That's enough.

23:13.870 --> 23:15.990
- Was it something I said?

23:15.990 --> 23:17.580
Did I use too much teeth?

23:17.580 --> 23:20.420
- Yes, but that's besides the point.

23:20.420 --> 23:23.260
I can't come, not like this.

23:23.260 --> 23:24.260
- Why not?

23:24.260 --> 23:26.920
Is it some kind of
kinky tantric sex thing?

23:26.920 --> 23:28.400
- The world as we know it,

23:28.400 --> 23:29.480
it's going to change soon.

23:29.480 --> 23:32.400
- That's hot, now let me
finish what I started.

23:32.400 --> 23:33.390
- No, Bart!

23:33.390 --> 23:34.960
My orgasm is lethal!

23:34.960 --> 23:36.580
It would blow your head clean off!

23:36.580 --> 23:38.420
- I'm startin' to like the sound of that.

23:38.420 --> 23:39.540
- No, Bart, literally.

23:39.540 --> 23:42.200
Your skull would explode
the second I reach orgasm.

23:42.200 --> 23:43.140
- Hot.

23:43.140 --> 23:44.780
- No, Bart!

23:44.780 --> 23:46.110
In a bad way.

23:46.110 --> 23:48.110
It's a superpower I can't control.

23:48.110 --> 23:50.320
The intensity of my orgasm kills people.

23:50.320 --> 23:51.500
Their heads explode!

23:51.500 --> 23:54.593
Men, women, people of the
transgender persuasion,

23:56.040 --> 23:57.812
farm animals.

23:57.812 --> 23:59.610
(gentle melodic music)

23:59.610 --> 24:01.422
You don't know what it's like,

24:01.422 --> 24:04.470
to have to go around with
perpetual blue balls.

24:04.470 --> 24:06.840
It's the burden of my superpowers,

24:06.840 --> 24:10.080
to be eternally sexy,

24:10.080 --> 24:13.833
but unable to get off without
destroying my partner.

24:16.041 --> 24:18.360
(awing)

24:18.360 --> 24:19.603
- Poor Dynastud.

24:20.930 --> 24:21.763
Come here.

24:26.420 --> 24:29.003
(gently sighs)

24:32.538 --> 24:35.480
(moaning and panting)

24:35.480 --> 24:37.750
- No wait, it's too dangerous!

24:37.750 --> 24:39.880
- Can't I just give you a handy?!

24:39.880 --> 24:40.713
- No!

24:40.713 --> 24:43.370
My salty soft serve would
destroy these fine woodlands.

24:43.370 --> 24:45.670
And I am firm believer
in forest conservation.

24:47.540 --> 24:50.183
I must remain pure with you for now.

24:51.380 --> 24:52.780
- Really?!

24:52.780 --> 24:53.613
- Yes.

24:55.120 --> 24:56.800
I need you, Bart.

24:56.800 --> 25:01.093
Your essence, your impact
on me is undeniable.

25:03.680 --> 25:06.553
But I don't need you in
the ways you might expect.

25:08.670 --> 25:11.170
(light music)

25:14.920 --> 25:17.763
(thudding)

25:17.763 --> 25:20.825
(doorbell dinging)

25:20.825 --> 25:24.075
(upbeat melodic music)

25:30.744 --> 25:33.310
- There you go.

25:33.310 --> 25:35.460
This will help calm you down,

25:35.460 --> 25:38.316
stop your crying.

25:38.316 --> 25:39.149
(sighing)

25:39.149 --> 25:40.710
- [Teddy] Will she be alright, doctor?

25:40.710 --> 25:45.410
- Well, like all women who
have been spurned by men,

25:45.410 --> 25:47.270
she's gone a little crazy,

25:47.270 --> 25:50.330
lost her place in the world.

25:50.330 --> 25:53.093
- I feel woozy.

25:54.340 --> 25:55.450
- Senator Hightower,

25:55.450 --> 25:57.970
the two MAGA Agents are here to see you.

25:57.970 --> 26:00.133
- Good, I'll meet them in the dining room.

26:02.550 --> 26:04.590
Are you all finished with her, doctor?

26:04.590 --> 26:06.370
Will this keep her from whining?

26:06.370 --> 26:08.340
- One more item.

26:09.940 --> 26:13.960
Her banana basket needs to be filled,

26:13.960 --> 26:16.300
so I brought these

26:16.300 --> 26:20.790
to help her feel full and satisfied,

26:20.790 --> 26:23.160
until you find her man again.

26:23.160 --> 26:25.480
- Oh my.

26:25.480 --> 26:27.870
- Dr. Chutney, you're a genius!

26:27.870 --> 26:28.920
I'll leave you to it.

26:30.251 --> 26:31.867
(cap popping)

26:31.867 --> 26:35.920
(light elevator music)

26:35.920 --> 26:38.413
Gentlemen, thank you for coming.

26:39.320 --> 26:41.640
I have a problem.

26:41.640 --> 26:44.960
I need you to track down
my daughter's husband.

26:44.960 --> 26:47.640
He left just as he was about to plow Patty

26:47.640 --> 26:49.220
and give me an heir.

26:49.220 --> 26:50.913
I heard you two were the best.

26:52.230 --> 26:55.230
- Is this your daughter
here, in that photo?

26:55.230 --> 26:56.400
- Yes.

26:56.400 --> 26:58.530
That was Patty in happier times.

26:58.530 --> 27:00.800
She used to be quite the equestrian.

27:00.800 --> 27:03.990
Sadly, we had to shoot the horse.

27:03.990 --> 27:08.021
She was becoming too attached.

27:08.021 --> 27:09.040
(slurping)

27:09.040 --> 27:10.173
Ha, memories.

27:11.010 --> 27:13.161
By the way, how is your tea?

27:13.161 --> 27:14.750
(tea splashing)

27:14.750 --> 27:17.030
- Tastes like my Aunt Rosalie's vagina

27:17.030 --> 27:20.173
after an 18 hour shift at
the sauerkraut factory.

27:22.010 --> 27:22.933
- I kinda like it.

27:23.780 --> 27:26.110
- Well, touch my balls!

27:26.110 --> 27:27.630
Sam likes it!

27:27.630 --> 27:30.113
Well, let's thrown a fuckin' parade!

27:33.550 --> 27:36.030
Sorry, I recently quit smoking,

27:36.030 --> 27:37.180
and I'm on the patches.

27:39.070 --> 27:41.020
(groaning)

27:41.020 --> 27:42.300
But enough about me!

27:42.300 --> 27:44.375
This chode we're talking about,

27:44.375 --> 27:45.825
do you have a picture of him?

27:48.543 --> 27:49.710
(groans)

27:49.710 --> 27:51.570
- Glamor shots.

27:51.570 --> 27:53.810
Are you sure this guy's not gay?

27:53.810 --> 27:58.140
- Let me remind you that
homosexuality is illegal.

27:58.140 --> 28:00.803
- I didn't mean to imply anything.

28:01.750 --> 28:04.354
- He does look kind of fruity, though.

28:04.354 --> 28:07.577
- Oh, daddy, I feel much better.

28:08.700 --> 28:10.890
- Glad to hear it, pumpkin.

28:10.890 --> 28:14.740
- These are Agent Sam
and Detective Vargas.

28:14.740 --> 28:16.660
They're going to help track down Bart

28:16.660 --> 28:18.560
and get him to want to fuck you again.

28:19.636 --> 28:22.227
(sobbing)

28:22.227 --> 28:25.800
Oh no, dummy, don't cry over him.

28:25.800 --> 28:27.410
He's worthless!

28:27.410 --> 28:28.850
As you can see, gentlemen,

28:28.850 --> 28:30.520
my daughter is distraught

28:30.520 --> 28:32.420
over her ignominious jilting.

28:32.420 --> 28:33.680
- Left at the altar, huh?

28:33.680 --> 28:34.600
- Worse!

28:34.600 --> 28:36.253
Left in the marriage bed.

28:37.120 --> 28:40.450
Well, you can see the
toll it's taken on her.

28:40.450 --> 28:43.150
Her face distorted by tears,

28:43.150 --> 28:44.900
her once gorgeous knockers,

28:44.900 --> 28:46.323
sagging with humiliation.

28:47.501 --> 28:48.991
(sobbing)

28:48.991 --> 28:50.703
- I'm undesirable!

28:51.795 --> 28:53.580
- No!

28:53.580 --> 28:54.453
- I don't know.

28:55.420 --> 28:57.170
I think you're lookin' pretty good.

28:58.530 --> 29:01.213
I mean, crazy, sad,

29:02.050 --> 29:04.840
and dressed like one of
those girls from Brazzers.

29:04.840 --> 29:07.267
Oh, I fucking love those girls!

29:07.267 --> 29:08.100
(laughing)

29:08.100 --> 29:10.823
And your tears, enticing.

29:11.690 --> 29:15.690
I love a woman with ready
access to her emotions.

29:15.690 --> 29:18.130
And this so-called husband

29:18.130 --> 29:19.957
ran away from this tight package?!

29:21.210 --> 29:24.940
Why, it seems to me like your husband

29:24.940 --> 29:27.120
might be a good old freckle puncher!

29:27.120 --> 29:28.529
- Vargas!
- I'm sorry!

29:28.529 --> 29:29.362
Sorry!

29:30.920 --> 29:31.923
I meant homosexual.

29:33.790 --> 29:36.513
Not you, he's into the
wang is what I'm saying!

29:38.370 --> 29:40.420
- Do you think you could describe the man

29:41.440 --> 29:44.210
that kidnapped your husband?

29:44.210 --> 29:45.750
- Well, I only got a quick look at him

29:45.750 --> 29:47.190
when he ran off with my Bart,

29:47.190 --> 29:48.270
and it was really dark,

29:48.270 --> 29:50.120
so I'm not sure how good
I'm gonna be at this,

29:50.120 --> 29:54.110
but he was tall, like 6'2".

29:54.110 --> 29:55.620
- Good, good.

29:55.620 --> 30:00.100
- And he was beautiful, like a Greek God!

30:00.100 --> 30:02.410
He had one of those torsos that taper down

30:02.410 --> 30:05.390
from broad, muscular
shoulders to a narrow waist,

30:05.390 --> 30:09.020
and he had hands, like
the paws of a great cat!

30:09.020 --> 30:11.823
Like a tiger with fingers!

30:12.750 --> 30:16.283
And his butt rode kinda high and rounded.

30:17.180 --> 30:19.433
- Okay okay, enough!

30:20.330 --> 30:21.233
What do ya got?

30:26.671 --> 30:29.047
Dynastud!

30:29.047 --> 30:30.957
(eerie music)

30:30.957 --> 30:33.707
(water dripping)

30:34.582 --> 30:37.490
- You know, I usually
love a man in uniform.

30:37.490 --> 30:40.053
But you, not so much.

30:41.420 --> 30:44.973
- Well, today is the last
day that I wear this uniform.

30:46.180 --> 30:48.670
I'm sure you didn't hear
the news from your cell,

30:48.670 --> 30:50.970
but starting tomorrow,

30:50.970 --> 30:53.989
I will be a United States Senator!

30:53.989 --> 30:54.822
(chuckles)

30:54.822 --> 30:57.373
I think a congratulations are in order.

30:59.150 --> 31:00.283
- I'm gonna kill you.

31:01.550 --> 31:02.383
(chuckles)

31:02.383 --> 31:03.643
- No, you're not.

31:05.660 --> 31:09.290
In fact, you're going to join the party.

31:09.290 --> 31:11.310
- What are you gonna do?

31:11.310 --> 31:12.410
Lobotomize me?

31:12.410 --> 31:15.310
- I'm going to have the
gay beaten out of you.

31:15.310 --> 31:16.463
Meet Gunther!

31:17.370 --> 31:20.010
Hobbies include stock car racing,

31:20.010 --> 31:25.010
weight training, and busting skulls.

31:25.712 --> 31:26.924
- Yipes!

31:26.924 --> 31:29.861
- Gunther crush Dynastud!

31:29.861 --> 31:31.710
(electronic guitar rock music)

31:31.710 --> 31:36.710
(punches thudding)
(grunting)

31:39.530 --> 31:40.823
- You punch like a fag.

31:41.924 --> 31:43.360
(whooshing)

31:43.360 --> 31:45.145
- Find him, you idiot!

31:45.145 --> 31:48.318
(heavy rock music)

31:48.318 --> 31:53.318
(punch thudding)
(grunting)

31:58.722 --> 32:00.343
(groaning)

32:00.343 --> 32:02.702
(punch thudding)
(grunting)

32:02.702 --> 32:04.952
(clanking)

32:12.977 --> 32:14.605
(whooshing)

32:14.605 --> 32:17.570
(grunting)
(clanking)

32:17.570 --> 32:19.318
(groaning)

32:19.318 --> 32:21.120
(screaming)

32:21.120 --> 32:23.537
(splooshing)

32:30.290 --> 32:32.113
There's the big gun I was expecting.

32:33.112 --> 32:34.821
(gun shot booming)

32:34.821 --> 32:37.821
(suspenseful music)

32:41.034 --> 32:42.802
(shouting)

32:42.802 --> 32:43.690
(grunting)

32:43.690 --> 32:46.850
- This whole place is under surveillance.

32:46.850 --> 32:48.690
If you kill me,

32:48.690 --> 32:52.580
it'll give them reason
to track your kind down.

32:52.580 --> 32:54.560
- I'm gonna keep you alive,

32:54.560 --> 32:57.970
but only because I wanna
see you rot in the cooler.

32:57.970 --> 32:59.337
- That'll be the day.

33:02.220 --> 33:05.763
That man is a dangerous
enemy of the state.

33:06.830 --> 33:09.603
When you find him, kill
him without hesitation.

33:10.600 --> 33:14.190
But be sure and bring Bart back alive.

33:14.190 --> 33:15.280
- Do you really think you'll be able

33:15.280 --> 33:16.933
to find him, Detective Vargas?

33:19.840 --> 33:23.300
- Oh, my sweet vagina galore,

33:23.300 --> 33:26.720
we'll track him down and
bring him back to you.

33:26.720 --> 33:30.197
And he'll be in your arms
and balls deep in your vag

33:30.197 --> 33:32.140
before the next episode

33:32.140 --> 33:34.093
of Who Told You You Could Dance is on.

33:35.414 --> 33:37.014
- Well, I'm glad that's settled.

33:38.503 --> 33:40.901
(ball clanking)

33:40.901 --> 33:42.490
- What was that?

33:42.490 --> 33:46.143
- Uh, one of Dr. Chutney's
balls just dropped.

33:51.659 --> 33:53.920
(smooching)

33:53.920 --> 33:55.470
- [Gaydar] Dynastud, if
you could take a minute

33:55.470 --> 33:57.110
to stop checking out Bart's ass,

33:57.110 --> 33:59.934
we have a red menace that
has to be dealt with.

33:59.934 --> 34:02.600
(insects chirping)

34:02.600 --> 34:03.700
- Why are we stopping?

34:05.570 --> 34:07.963
- Just a little something
I have to take care of.

34:08.870 --> 34:11.300
- Do you think they have
something to drink in there?

34:11.300 --> 34:13.400
I'm getting thirsty from all this walking.

34:14.560 --> 34:19.283
- Inside will be a tall,
cool glass of justice.

34:20.398 --> 34:23.481
(footsteps clanking)

34:25.090 --> 34:26.033
- What's in here?

34:27.170 --> 34:28.670
- Russian bot farm.

34:28.670 --> 34:30.179
- They grow bots?

34:30.179 --> 34:32.870
- No, they grow the seeds of discontent

34:32.870 --> 34:35.513
that poison the fertile
fields of Democracy.

34:36.500 --> 34:38.510
- You know, whenever you talk like that,

34:38.510 --> 34:39.940
I get rock hard.

34:39.940 --> 34:40.973
Why is that?

34:42.460 --> 34:44.030
- I've got a plan.

34:44.030 --> 34:45.053
And it involves you.

34:46.179 --> 34:49.434
But it's gonna require Cracker Jack timing

34:49.434 --> 34:51.793
and a high probability of lethal force.

34:53.760 --> 34:55.159
- Wait.

34:55.159 --> 34:57.823
What is a Russian bot
farm doing in America?

34:58.840 --> 35:01.450
- Bart, they're Russians.

35:01.450 --> 35:03.175
They're sneaky like that.

35:03.175 --> 35:06.258
(keyboards clacking)

35:14.190 --> 35:15.520
- Alexi!

35:15.520 --> 35:16.530
What is good word

35:17.410 --> 35:19.093
rhyme with snowflake?

35:21.124 --> 35:23.029
- Earthquake!

35:23.029 --> 35:26.696
(speaking foreign language)

35:28.003 --> 35:31.130
- Krinkov, what is it you are working on?

35:31.130 --> 35:33.530
- Boris, I work on very funny meme

35:33.530 --> 35:36.450
of Ronald Reagan spanking Hillary Clinton

35:36.450 --> 35:38.436
with a large black dildo!

35:38.436 --> 35:41.450
(laughing)

35:41.450 --> 35:44.040
- Much liberal tears will flow

35:44.040 --> 35:46.948
when they see that, I tell you!

35:46.948 --> 35:48.650
(laughing)

35:48.650 --> 35:49.483
Okay!

35:51.460 --> 35:55.530
- Today I pretend to
be black man on Twitter

35:55.530 --> 35:58.920
who wants to make with the
pregnant of white girls

35:58.920 --> 36:02.036
and leave them on the footsteps!

36:02.036 --> 36:04.286
(laughing)

36:07.416 --> 36:10.117
(doorbell dinging)
(grunts)

36:10.117 --> 36:11.409
(light music)

36:11.409 --> 36:13.842
- Do we know of anyone coming?

36:13.842 --> 36:14.675
(speaking foreign language)

36:14.675 --> 36:15.570
- Do Boris?

36:15.570 --> 36:16.403
- Also (speaking foreign language).

36:19.500 --> 36:20.475
(doorbell ringing)

36:20.475 --> 36:22.475
(sighs)

36:26.182 --> 36:27.820
(suspenseful music)

36:27.820 --> 36:29.020
- Hello!

36:29.020 --> 36:30.220
- [Bart] Pizza delivery!

36:31.907 --> 36:33.130
- What?

36:33.130 --> 36:36.810
- [Bart] Pizza delivery
for 233 Industrial Way.

36:36.810 --> 36:39.283
- Is us, what kind of pizza is being?

36:45.260 --> 36:46.740
- Um, saucy deep dish.

36:46.740 --> 36:47.573
- No!

36:48.532 --> 36:49.890
What is it made of?

36:50.876 --> 36:52.380
(punch whapping)
(grunting)

36:52.380 --> 36:53.213
- Whoa!

36:54.120 --> 36:56.629
You know, I never thought
that was gonna work.

36:56.629 --> 36:57.770
(groaning)

36:57.770 --> 36:59.890
- They're Russians, Bart,
they're not very bright.

36:59.890 --> 37:02.161
- Eating now second amendment.

37:02.161 --> 37:05.161
(gun shots booming)

37:10.680 --> 37:13.741
It's useless, guns don't kill people!

37:13.741 --> 37:15.853
(gun shots booming)

37:15.853 --> 37:19.815
Die (speaking foreign language)!

37:19.815 --> 37:20.648
(whooshing)

37:20.648 --> 37:22.278
- That's cocksucker to you both.

37:22.278 --> 37:24.982
(gun shots booming)

37:24.982 --> 37:28.315
(intense melodic music)

37:33.180 --> 37:34.720
What, are you gonna hack me to death?

37:34.720 --> 37:36.380
- No, you cannot ban me.

37:36.380 --> 37:38.500
I'm having a free speech.

37:38.500 --> 37:39.333
(shouting)

37:39.333 --> 37:41.380
- Do I look like the government?

37:41.380 --> 37:43.000
- Send backup!

37:43.000 --> 37:46.413
Big sexy gay man is
here killing everybody!

37:46.413 --> 37:48.663
(shouting)

37:51.063 --> 37:52.900
- Tell me who is paying you

37:52.900 --> 37:54.450
or I'll give you Borges bell.

37:54.450 --> 37:55.550
- Hightower!

37:55.550 --> 37:57.290
Teddy Hightower!

37:57.290 --> 37:58.520
- I knew it.

37:58.520 --> 38:00.840
Well, I want you to give Teddy
a special message from me.

38:00.840 --> 38:01.673
- Anything!

38:01.673 --> 38:04.193
Just don't kill me, big sexy gay man!

38:05.250 --> 38:07.667
(whispering)

38:09.722 --> 38:11.869
Oh, fuck!

38:11.869 --> 38:14.536
(playful music)

38:21.530 --> 38:23.520
- Clearly this poor girl's husband

38:23.520 --> 38:26.220
has been abducted by Dynastud.

38:26.220 --> 38:28.120
Probably turned him gay already

38:28.120 --> 38:30.343
through the power of his sexual mesmerism!

38:32.606 --> 38:36.230
Oh, it's safe to assume
they're in cahoots!

38:36.230 --> 38:39.170
And clearly, those queers
are armed and dangerous!

38:39.170 --> 38:41.203
But where the hell are they headed?

38:42.217 --> 38:43.380
- Bottom's Up.

38:43.380 --> 38:46.200
- Sam, it's a bit early for day drinking,

38:46.200 --> 38:47.387
but what the hell, what
have you got on ya?

38:47.387 --> 38:49.013
- No, no, Bottom's Up,

38:49.880 --> 38:51.780
the underground bar on the Canadian border

38:51.780 --> 38:54.970
for gays escaping the U.S.
to the Great White North.

38:54.970 --> 38:57.002
They must be headed there.

38:57.002 --> 38:59.502
(eerie music)

39:03.051 --> 39:05.718
(door creaking)

39:08.659 --> 39:11.326
(door clanking)

39:12.770 --> 39:13.649
- Hi, dad!

39:13.649 --> 39:14.482
(gasping)

39:14.482 --> 39:16.203
- Leaping lawn jockeys!

39:17.183 --> 39:19.590
Oh, it's only you, pussycat.

39:19.590 --> 39:21.210
- Daddy, I'm so sad.

39:21.210 --> 39:24.797
- Oh, God damn that Bart.

39:24.797 --> 39:26.430
And Dr. Chutney,

39:26.430 --> 39:28.180
he was supposed to make you better!

39:29.018 --> 39:31.008
(ball clanking)

39:31.008 --> 39:32.163
What the hell was that?

39:33.380 --> 39:34.560
- Oh, it's one of those balls

39:34.560 --> 39:36.023
from Tibet Dr. Chutney gave me,

39:36.023 --> 39:37.690
and now when I'm really sad,

39:37.690 --> 39:40.840
they just come out.

39:40.840 --> 39:42.918
Do you want to go get ice cream with me?

39:42.918 --> 39:44.950
- Oh, sorry, pookie.

39:44.950 --> 39:46.220
I have to check on the progress

39:46.220 --> 39:49.121
of our super weapon development program.

39:49.121 --> 39:50.993
- Oh, (ball clanking), okay.

39:54.760 --> 39:56.133
Daddy, do you miss mommy?

39:57.790 --> 39:59.370
- Not really.

39:59.370 --> 40:01.590
I mean, I was the one who had her killed

40:01.590 --> 40:03.993
after she kept giving me girl babies.

40:04.915 --> 40:07.046
(chuckles)

40:07.046 --> 40:10.590
(footsteps pattering)

40:10.590 --> 40:11.959
- Bye, dad.

40:11.959 --> 40:14.626
(ball clanking)

40:16.677 --> 40:19.844
(electronic bleeping)

40:28.174 --> 40:30.350
- Good afternoon, Senator!

40:30.350 --> 40:31.543
- Dr. Chutney!

40:32.690 --> 40:34.100
Okay, then.

40:34.100 --> 40:35.160
Let's see it.

40:35.160 --> 40:39.320
- The weapon is almost complete.

40:39.320 --> 40:41.258
Behold!

40:41.258 --> 40:42.890
(gasping)

40:42.890 --> 40:44.343
- It's beautiful!

40:46.030 --> 40:47.530
Will it work?

40:47.530 --> 40:49.229
- Will it work?!

40:49.229 --> 40:50.290
(laughing)

40:50.290 --> 40:51.190
Senator!

40:51.190 --> 40:53.310
When the weapon is complete,

40:53.310 --> 40:56.660
all we need to do is fire it,

40:56.660 --> 40:59.950
and any homosexual

40:59.950 --> 41:03.370
will become a heterosexual.

41:03.370 --> 41:05.340
Think about it.

41:05.340 --> 41:08.530
Lesbians touching penises.

41:08.530 --> 41:11.274
Gays munching the rug.

41:11.274 --> 41:13.524
(laughing)

41:14.420 --> 41:17.640
We just point and shoot!

41:17.640 --> 41:18.948
Shoot straight!

41:18.948 --> 41:21.198
(laughing)

41:23.260 --> 41:25.193
- Oh, they won't know what hit them.

41:26.830 --> 41:28.990
And after we capture Bart,

41:28.990 --> 41:30.740
that errant cocksucker will be able

41:30.740 --> 41:33.930
to please my daughter and give me an heir.

41:33.930 --> 41:35.260
(laughing)

41:35.260 --> 41:38.373
Oh, this is mine.

41:40.159 --> 41:42.489
(gasping)

41:42.489 --> 41:44.350
It comes with one of these!

41:44.350 --> 41:46.600
(laughing)

41:49.140 --> 41:52.553
- All this laughing is
making me dehydrated.

41:53.750 --> 41:56.470
- And after we get my daughter's man,

41:56.470 --> 42:00.650
all the gays will drop to their knees.

42:00.650 --> 42:02.210
(laughing)

42:02.210 --> 42:03.290
Get it!

42:03.290 --> 42:04.961
- [Together] Their knees!

42:04.961 --> 42:07.211
(laughing)

42:10.707 --> 42:12.699
(thudding)

42:12.699 --> 42:15.616
(intriguing music)

42:18.071 --> 42:20.821
(birds chirping)

42:25.920 --> 42:26.913
- We piss here.

42:30.536 --> 42:32.260
(zippers scratching)

42:32.260 --> 42:34.270
- Where are you taking me?

42:34.270 --> 42:36.000
- To a compound.

42:36.000 --> 42:38.160
Just over the border in Canada.

42:38.160 --> 42:40.970
A secret gay bar called Bottom's Up.

42:40.970 --> 42:43.070
- And what's in this Bottom's Up?

42:43.070 --> 42:44.240
- A safe passage

42:45.210 --> 42:48.023
that will lead me to the
only man I ever really loved.

42:48.990 --> 42:50.106
- Love.

42:50.106 --> 42:51.790
(urine splashing)

42:51.790 --> 42:53.080
- Hey.

42:53.080 --> 42:54.083
Nice cock, Bart.

42:55.010 --> 42:57.000
I'm a top, myself.

42:57.000 --> 42:59.260
But it's got a really beautiful shape

42:59.260 --> 43:00.553
and an impressive girth.

43:01.490 --> 43:04.040
You'll make a bottom very happy some day.

43:04.040 --> 43:04.873
- Thanks.

43:08.530 --> 43:10.610
By the way, you never told me

43:10.610 --> 43:12.093
how you got your superpowers.

43:13.860 --> 43:15.410
- Do you really need to know?

43:15.410 --> 43:16.740
- Well, yeah.

43:16.740 --> 43:17.763
I'm curious.

43:20.830 --> 43:23.470
- I was bit by a radioactive spider.

43:23.470 --> 43:25.320
- I've heard this one before.

43:25.320 --> 43:27.870
- It was a gay radioactive spider.

43:27.870 --> 43:29.540
Chucked gooey white wads of--

43:29.540 --> 43:32.223
- Yeah, alright, all caught up, thanks.

43:38.010 --> 43:38.843
- Okay.

43:40.230 --> 43:41.303
If you must know,

43:43.123 --> 43:43.956
(light music)

43:43.956 --> 43:46.860
I wasn't always the hunk
of smoldering man flesh

43:46.860 --> 43:48.353
you see before you now.

43:49.750 --> 43:53.700
I was a scrawny nerd,
born on a farm in Vermont.

43:53.700 --> 43:57.074
I had two loving mothers
named May and Martha.

43:57.074 --> 43:59.657
(joyful music)

44:06.840 --> 44:10.373
Well, one night, I was
out catching fireflies,

44:11.710 --> 44:13.753
and I saw something fall from the sky.

44:32.740 --> 44:34.290
- [Orb] Do not be afraid of me.

44:34.290 --> 44:36.320
I have come from a distant star

44:36.320 --> 44:38.870
to bring peace to your waring planet

44:38.870 --> 44:42.451
and wisdom light years beyond your own.

44:42.451 --> 44:44.020
- Awesome!

44:44.020 --> 44:45.590
- [Orb] Uh, um, wait.

44:45.590 --> 44:47.160
What did you say?

44:47.160 --> 44:48.330
- Awesome!

44:48.330 --> 44:50.930
- [Orb] Ah, fuck me sideways!

44:50.930 --> 44:53.260
Is this 51 Pegasus B?

44:53.260 --> 44:55.020
- No, this is Earth.

44:55.020 --> 44:56.480
- [Orb] Sometimes you have to wonder

44:56.480 --> 44:58.140
who's mindin' the storm.

44:58.140 --> 45:00.750
Okay, fine, Earth.

45:00.750 --> 45:04.330
You backwards monkeys have
your troubles, too, I guess.

45:04.330 --> 45:06.080
Now, how do you solve them here?

45:06.080 --> 45:08.564
Hold on, let me check the database.

45:08.564 --> 45:10.040
(electronic bleeping)

45:10.040 --> 45:11.700
Superheroes, huh?

45:11.700 --> 45:13.170
Okay, fine.

45:13.170 --> 45:16.160
You'll be a superhero,
how does that sound?

45:16.160 --> 45:17.460
- Sounds great!

45:17.460 --> 45:19.080
- [Orb] A real quiz kid, huh?

45:19.080 --> 45:21.350
Well listen, there's one problem.

45:21.350 --> 45:23.670
If I change you into a superhero,

45:23.670 --> 45:26.160
you must heed this warning.
- Nah, I'm good.

45:26.160 --> 45:27.960
- [Orb] Goddammit, this is bad!

45:27.960 --> 45:30.400
It will effect your
life, your entire life!

45:30.400 --> 45:31.430
- Let's just do this!

45:31.430 --> 45:33.007
- [Orb] Can't you just wait a second?!

45:33.007 --> 45:34.740
- No, I wanna be big and strong!

45:34.740 --> 45:39.450
- Oy vey, this meshugganah
wants to be a superhero!

45:39.450 --> 45:41.291
Okay, fine.

45:41.291 --> 45:42.760
Here we go!

45:42.760 --> 45:45.760
(suspenseful music)

45:54.380 --> 45:55.233
- Look at me.

45:56.621 --> 45:57.803
I'm beautiful.

45:59.080 --> 46:03.093
I can so seriously get
laid with a bod like this.

46:06.570 --> 46:09.270
No more lonely nights with
the milking machine for me.

46:10.894 --> 46:11.727
(smooching)

46:11.727 --> 46:13.340
- [Orb] Yeah, about that!

46:13.340 --> 46:15.200
- [Dynastud] It made me
into the irresistible

46:15.200 --> 46:16.523
stud I am today.

46:17.400 --> 46:21.838
But great beauty comes
with a terrible price.

46:21.838 --> 46:24.755
(funky club music)

46:38.130 --> 46:39.830
- This is my first time.

46:39.830 --> 46:41.900
Be gentle, Jeremiah.

46:41.900 --> 46:43.350
- This is my first time, too.

46:44.480 --> 46:47.733
And call me Dynastud.

46:48.800 --> 46:51.437
- I'll call you anything
you want me to, Dynastud.

46:59.306 --> 47:01.473
(moaning)

47:04.140 --> 47:06.390
(groaning)

47:07.657 --> 47:09.490
(explosion booming)

47:09.490 --> 47:12.323
(animals calling)

47:16.405 --> 47:19.410
- What have I become?!

47:19.410 --> 47:21.200
My penis was a lethal weapon,

47:21.200 --> 47:23.510
and I had a license to thrill.

47:23.510 --> 47:25.320
Thankfully, no matter what,

47:25.320 --> 47:27.913
I had the unconditional
love of my mothers.

47:29.110 --> 47:31.170
Momma May?
- Mm-hmm?

47:31.170 --> 47:34.396
- Can I ask you about love?

47:34.396 --> 47:35.680
(laughing)

47:35.680 --> 47:38.470
- You're growin' up so fast, aren't you?

47:38.470 --> 47:40.670
- We've had to buy him all new clothes,

47:40.670 --> 47:43.070
just look at those shoulders!

47:43.070 --> 47:45.160
(laughing)

47:45.160 --> 47:47.189
- What's your question, baby boy?

47:47.189 --> 47:48.790
(light music)

47:48.790 --> 47:51.370
- Do you think it's bad to love someone

47:51.370 --> 47:53.420
if you know you're going to destroy them?

47:57.110 --> 47:57.943
- Yes.

47:59.220 --> 48:00.720
Yes, I do.

48:00.720 --> 48:03.340
With powerful love, comes a great duty.

48:03.340 --> 48:06.683
We must never allow those
we love come to harm.

48:08.400 --> 48:13.210
- But what if you really
need to love someone,

48:13.210 --> 48:15.510
but you know they'll be hurt?

48:15.510 --> 48:18.493
- It's such a big
question for a young man.

48:20.400 --> 48:23.683
If your love will hurt someone,

48:24.940 --> 48:27.483
then it really isn't love, is it?

48:29.000 --> 48:29.833
- Guess not.

48:32.790 --> 48:33.630
- That's right.

48:33.630 --> 48:34.930
Now go to sleep, Jeremiah.

48:36.930 --> 48:38.580
- Don't call me Jeremiah anymore.

48:40.010 --> 48:41.543
Call me Dynastud.

48:43.835 --> 48:45.236
(laughing)

48:45.236 --> 48:47.927
- You crazy kids and your nicknames.

48:47.927 --> 48:50.177
(laughing)

48:54.992 --> 48:57.492
(light music)

49:03.437 --> 49:05.770
- Dynastud.

49:08.598 --> 49:10.765
Dynastud.

49:13.620 --> 49:17.500
- [Vargas] Tonight, we head
into the heart of darkness.

49:17.500 --> 49:18.932
- I'm not scared.

49:18.932 --> 49:19.860
(laughing)

49:19.860 --> 49:23.147
- Who knows what horrors
these homos have going on?!

49:24.970 --> 49:26.369
- Gay people don't bother me.

49:26.369 --> 49:28.193
- Well, they should bother you.

49:28.193 --> 49:30.248
Because they bother me, ergo,

49:30.248 --> 49:32.165
they should bother you!

49:33.120 --> 49:36.679
With their glitter and their parades.

49:36.679 --> 49:37.512
(scoffs)

49:37.512 --> 49:42.512
And the Queer as Folk
television series on the BBC.

49:42.860 --> 49:45.320
Well, you better enjoy
that bologna sandwich

49:45.320 --> 49:49.000
'cause tonight, we go undercover.

49:49.000 --> 49:50.096
- What are you talking about?

49:50.096 --> 49:51.460
(laughing)

49:51.460 --> 49:53.960
- We need to understand them, Sam, hm?

49:53.960 --> 49:55.950
We need to think like them,

49:55.950 --> 49:59.420
understand them, become them.

49:59.420 --> 50:00.980
Gay men!

50:00.980 --> 50:02.680
That's right, I'll be the pitcher,

50:02.680 --> 50:03.870
and you'll be the catcher!

50:03.870 --> 50:06.600
On this hardball team of hard balls!

50:06.600 --> 50:09.670
Playin' the ball game, oh yes!

50:09.670 --> 50:11.563
We will play balls.

50:12.660 --> 50:14.463
- Maybe you should take up smoking again.

50:14.463 --> 50:16.718
(laughing)

50:16.718 --> 50:19.710
- Sam, Samwise Gamgee!

50:19.710 --> 50:24.704
Tonight we might be
smoking a big bag of dicks.

50:24.704 --> 50:25.595
(sniffing)

50:25.595 --> 50:27.481
(groaning)

50:27.481 --> 50:28.314
And who knows!

50:28.314 --> 50:29.660
At the end of all this,

50:29.660 --> 50:32.830
you might get a real piece
of bologna in your mouth.

50:32.830 --> 50:34.233
Take it, take it!

50:35.538 --> 50:39.288
(intense melodic rock music)

51:04.580 --> 51:05.413
- This is it?

51:05.413 --> 51:07.740
It doesn't look like much.

51:07.740 --> 51:08.573
- This is it.

51:09.540 --> 51:11.540
We're here to meet my old friend,

51:11.540 --> 51:14.340
the meanest drag queen in all of Canada.

51:14.340 --> 51:15.860
He goes by the nom de guerre

51:15.860 --> 51:18.633
of Lee Van Queef.

51:19.610 --> 51:20.713
- Sounds like a gas.

51:24.910 --> 51:26.918
(knocking)

51:26.918 --> 51:29.060
(door creaking)

51:29.060 --> 51:30.430
- Password?

51:30.430 --> 51:33.859
- To a new world of Gods and monsters.

51:33.859 --> 51:37.026
(club music thumping)

51:51.690 --> 51:53.167
- Who's that man with the ass I just want

51:53.167 --> 51:55.990
to eat a steak and egg breakfast off of?

51:55.990 --> 51:58.990
Burma Zapper, you can still
bounce Loonies off this thing!

51:58.990 --> 52:00.920
- Oh, Lee, you old butt pirate.

52:00.920 --> 52:03.423
- Dynastud, you magnificent
bastard, bring it in!

52:04.630 --> 52:06.460
(slapping)

52:06.460 --> 52:07.610
Who's Peter Pan?

52:07.610 --> 52:08.770
- I'm Bart.

52:08.770 --> 52:10.170
- Pleasure to meet you Bart.

52:10.170 --> 52:12.240
Welcome to Bottom's Up,

52:12.240 --> 52:14.470
the last free zone in America.

52:14.470 --> 52:15.530
We've been the final stop

52:15.530 --> 52:17.750
for the queer underground
railroad for years,

52:17.750 --> 52:19.060
helpin' these wonderful people

52:19.060 --> 52:21.330
get their letters of transit to Canada,

52:21.330 --> 52:22.880
where they can live in freedom.

52:23.720 --> 52:24.940
- I've seen Lee

52:24.940 --> 52:27.250
take down an entire battalion

52:27.250 --> 52:28.900
of MAGA Shock Troops

52:28.900 --> 52:30.450
without even breaking a nail.

52:30.450 --> 52:33.440
- Oh, Dynastud, you always
knew how to flatter a girl.

52:33.440 --> 52:35.150
Now, both of you come with me.

52:35.150 --> 52:38.422
I've got what you need in my office.

52:38.422 --> 52:41.589
(club music thumping)

52:42.730 --> 52:44.463
- This place is like an armory.

52:46.830 --> 52:48.423
- [Lee] Hold that for me, sugar.

52:50.215 --> 52:53.130
(clicking)

52:53.130 --> 52:56.420
- Lee, people would kill for this!

52:56.420 --> 52:58.030
- What is it?

52:58.030 --> 52:59.380
- It's a Canadian passport.

53:00.330 --> 53:02.850
- Operation Neon Cobra has begun.

53:02.850 --> 53:05.113
- What's Operation Neon Cobra?

53:06.450 --> 53:09.170
- Boss, there's an
unidentified car outside.

53:09.170 --> 53:10.920
- Looks like you boys
brought trouble with you.

53:10.920 --> 53:12.470
Bobo, back door.

53:12.470 --> 53:13.303
- Gladly.

53:13.303 --> 53:14.930
- No, take them out the back door!

53:14.930 --> 53:16.525
And use protection!

53:16.525 --> 53:19.130
- I don't know, I'm kind
of a bareback man myself.

53:19.130 --> 53:21.010
- Goddammit, Bobo.

53:21.010 --> 53:22.060
Take this.

53:22.060 --> 53:23.150
- Yes, boss.

53:23.150 --> 53:24.323
Pushy old queen.

53:25.280 --> 53:26.900
- Lee, will you be okay?

53:26.900 --> 53:28.420
- Of course, baby, just
make sure to say hello

53:28.420 --> 53:29.253
to Bruce for me.

53:30.261 --> 53:33.244
(slapping)

53:33.244 --> 53:36.411
(club music thumping)

53:46.830 --> 53:48.050
- Goddammit.

53:48.050 --> 53:50.280
- Oh, stop pouting, Sam.

53:50.280 --> 53:52.310
- I told you I wanted to be the Indian.

53:52.310 --> 53:53.830
- You're not the Indian!

53:53.830 --> 53:55.260
You're the construction worker!

53:55.260 --> 53:57.050
- And I say goddammit!

53:57.050 --> 54:00.610
- I didn't write the song YMCA, Sam.

54:00.610 --> 54:03.530
It takes a man of certain moral character

54:03.530 --> 54:05.300
to be the Indian.

54:05.300 --> 54:07.450
And I'm the goddamn Indian!

54:07.450 --> 54:09.320
- Hey there, cutie.

54:09.320 --> 54:10.690
Nice buskins.

54:10.690 --> 54:13.900
- Hello, fellow gay man!

54:13.900 --> 54:16.170
Now, should I insert my penis

54:16.170 --> 54:19.263
into your mouth now or later?

54:20.207 --> 54:23.430
- I am married, asshole!

54:23.430 --> 54:24.980
Jeez, just take the compliment.

54:26.746 --> 54:29.079
(smooching)

54:30.400 --> 54:33.193
- That guy totally wanted my cock.

54:34.140 --> 54:35.680
- Nope.

54:35.680 --> 54:37.353
- Let's try a new tactic.

54:38.818 --> 54:42.151
(electronic club music)

54:43.730 --> 54:44.563
Hello!

54:45.520 --> 54:47.220
We come in peace,

54:47.220 --> 54:49.263
and we love to fuck butts!

54:50.717 --> 54:51.904
- You fuckin' creep!

54:51.904 --> 54:54.840
(shouting)

54:54.840 --> 54:56.710
- Jesus!
- Pardon me.

54:56.710 --> 55:00.630
Would you like to talk
about RuPaul's Drag Race?

55:00.630 --> 55:02.740
- You know, I'd love to,

55:02.740 --> 55:05.490
but I was just about to leave.

55:05.490 --> 55:09.390
I gotta get to a Gilbert
and Sullivan rehearsal.

55:09.390 --> 55:11.670
- Well, we should get together

55:11.670 --> 55:13.400
and hang out sometime.

55:13.400 --> 55:15.160
- You know, I'd like that.

55:15.160 --> 55:17.860
I feel like there's been a
real connection between us.

55:18.950 --> 55:19.783
Call me.

55:20.710 --> 55:22.230
Bye!

55:22.230 --> 55:24.070
- My God, Sam!

55:24.070 --> 55:26.246
You're like the gay whisperer!

55:26.246 --> 55:28.990
You can think like them, infiltrate them,

55:28.990 --> 55:30.213
penetrate them!

55:30.213 --> 55:33.553
Oh, you're going to lead
us straight to Dynastud!

55:34.580 --> 55:36.196
Let's dance!

55:36.196 --> 55:39.529
(electronic club music)

55:42.982 --> 55:43.990
(shouting)

55:43.990 --> 55:45.610
Why are you all flocking to him?

55:45.610 --> 55:46.750
- [Man] He's hot, dude.

55:46.750 --> 55:47.950
- He's super hot.

55:47.950 --> 55:49.823
- I just love this retro thing.

55:50.750 --> 55:52.887
- Why the fuck are they attracted to you

55:52.887 --> 55:54.220
and not me, Sam?!

55:54.220 --> 55:55.820
- Especially 'cause
you're the Indian, too!

55:55.820 --> 55:58.260
- Oh, fuck you!

55:58.260 --> 55:59.207
- Fuck you!

55:59.207 --> 56:00.540
(record scratching)

56:00.540 --> 56:02.293
- You can't stop the music!

56:03.393 --> 56:06.300
(funky club music)

56:06.300 --> 56:07.752
Sup, sweet tits?

56:07.752 --> 56:08.585
(slapping)
(groaning)

56:08.585 --> 56:10.340
- The name's Lee Van Queef.

56:10.340 --> 56:11.477
- Wow.

56:11.477 --> 56:12.720
(scoffs)

56:12.720 --> 56:14.000
I'd hit that.

56:14.000 --> 56:16.270
I mean, I know you're a dude and all,

56:16.270 --> 56:18.480
but I have tape.

56:18.480 --> 56:20.350
We can tuck it.

56:20.350 --> 56:22.800
- I provide my own tape, copper top.

56:22.800 --> 56:24.160
I am a professional.

56:24.160 --> 56:26.643
- So, Mrs. Van Queef,

56:27.550 --> 56:31.540
we know you're hiding Dynastud and Bart!

56:31.540 --> 56:32.577
So, where are they?!

56:33.550 --> 56:36.010
- Why would I tell a couple
pigs like you anything?

56:36.010 --> 56:37.780
- We're the law.

56:37.780 --> 56:40.180
- Well, I'm the law of
the jungle, motherfucker.

56:41.255 --> 56:45.086
And I would like to introduce
you to the Bear Squad!

56:45.086 --> 56:47.586
(funky music)

56:50.230 --> 56:53.560
- We are gonna mop the
floor with you two oinkers.

56:53.560 --> 56:54.473
- Sam?

56:55.530 --> 56:57.120
Deploy the twink, quick!

56:57.120 --> 56:58.363
Before they kill us!

56:59.329 --> 57:01.662
(whooshing)

57:09.572 --> 57:11.822
(grunting)

57:13.870 --> 57:15.740
- Ain't it always the way.

57:15.740 --> 57:18.480
Fine, let me introduce you to

57:18.480 --> 57:22.442
the Alberta chapter of
the K.D. Lang fan club!

57:22.442 --> 57:24.942
(funky music)

57:35.540 --> 57:37.060
- Dear God.

57:37.060 --> 57:40.390
Sam, I think we're about
to get fucked harder

57:40.390 --> 57:43.800
than a $10 whore during fleet week.

57:43.800 --> 57:45.290
- We're liberals.

57:45.290 --> 57:48.700
We've got kind hearts and
bottomless compassion.

57:48.700 --> 57:52.500
We love everyone, regardless
of their differences.

57:52.500 --> 57:54.070
We show tolerance in the face

57:54.070 --> 57:57.000
of even the most violent opposition.

57:57.000 --> 58:00.130
- Even though you bastards
took everything from us,

58:00.130 --> 58:02.150
and now we've gotta go live in Canada.

58:02.150 --> 58:05.470
- Seriously, I had to leave
my beautiful house in Georgia

58:05.470 --> 58:09.090
to come move to this
moose infested wasteland.

58:09.090 --> 58:12.190
- And everyone's so
goddamn nice all the time.

58:12.190 --> 58:15.010
- So, come to think of it,

58:15.010 --> 58:17.170
we really have no choice

58:17.170 --> 58:18.830
but to beat you to death.

58:18.830 --> 58:21.530
- Vargas, before we die,

58:21.530 --> 58:22.440
I need you to know

58:23.490 --> 58:24.590
I've always loved you.

58:25.594 --> 58:27.594
(awing)

58:29.535 --> 58:30.441
- Fag.

58:30.441 --> 58:31.477
(shouting)

58:31.477 --> 58:32.310
What?!

58:34.556 --> 58:35.389
(grunting)

58:35.389 --> 58:36.509
- Canadians!

58:36.509 --> 58:37.640
(laughing)

58:37.640 --> 58:39.106
- They hit like girls.

58:39.106 --> 58:40.923
(grunting)

58:40.923 --> 58:43.170
(groaning)

58:43.170 --> 58:44.770
- Drinks are the house, bitches!

58:48.643 --> 58:51.659
♪ O Canada ♪

58:51.659 --> 58:55.809
♪ Our home and native land ♪

58:55.809 --> 58:58.726
(insects chirping)

59:00.094 --> 59:02.844
(frogs croaking)

59:13.752 --> 59:16.290
- Penny for your thoughts, Dynastud?

59:16.290 --> 59:17.613
- Eat your s'mores, kid.

59:22.280 --> 59:24.273
- What's Operation Neon Cobra?

59:25.750 --> 59:27.523
- You'll find out soon enough.

59:30.420 --> 59:32.970
- Listen, I'm getting sick of this.

59:32.970 --> 59:34.700
You need to start giving
me some information

59:34.700 --> 59:37.020
because I'm tired of being
in the dark all the time

59:37.020 --> 59:38.830
and it's frustrating me!

59:38.830 --> 59:39.760
- Well, you're gonna have to find a way

59:39.760 --> 59:41.670
to relieve that frustration.

59:41.670 --> 59:43.750
- Well, I have the perfect way to do that,

59:43.750 --> 59:46.120
but it'll cause my head to explode.

59:46.120 --> 59:48.803
Jesus Christ, I'm so horny!

59:50.510 --> 59:52.160
- It's true.

59:52.160 --> 59:53.177
There was only one man

59:53.177 --> 59:56.070
who could survive the
assault of my sperm cannon.

59:56.070 --> 59:57.690
- Lucky him.

59:57.690 --> 59:59.740
Was this that Bruce guy?

59:59.740 --> 01:00:00.573
Who was he?

01:00:02.404 --> 01:00:06.520
- In all my life, I've only
ever truly loved one man.

01:00:07.740 --> 01:00:09.980
And his name is Bruce Li.

01:00:09.980 --> 01:00:13.280
- You mean the late, great
kung-fu master, Bruce Lee?

01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:15.690
- Not to be confused with
that other Bruce guy.

01:00:15.690 --> 01:00:17.090
His last name is spelled Li.

01:00:18.530 --> 01:00:20.158
But all the same.

01:00:20.158 --> 01:00:21.560
He was a great fighter,

01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:24.712
a mighty warrior, and a true hero.

01:00:24.712 --> 01:00:27.962
(funky 80s rock music)

01:00:32.340 --> 01:00:34.703
- Mecha Trump!

01:00:35.997 --> 01:00:39.863
- [Mecha Trump] Terminate, terminate!

01:00:39.863 --> 01:00:42.863
(footsteps booming)

01:00:45.564 --> 01:00:50.564
(zapping)
(screaming)

01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:53.380
- One day Bruce got hurt
while shooting a movie

01:00:53.380 --> 01:00:56.110
in Toronto called Fists of Karma,

01:00:56.110 --> 01:00:58.860
so he was put in cryogenic freeze.

01:00:58.860 --> 01:01:01.800
He healed, but nothing could revive him.

01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:03.780
But then we found the scrolls!

01:01:03.780 --> 01:01:07.240
And they said that only the
seed of one pure of heart

01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:08.963
could awaken the fallen warrior.

01:01:10.330 --> 01:01:11.163
And that seed

01:01:12.870 --> 01:01:13.873
is your semen, Bart.

01:01:14.946 --> 01:01:16.410
(ominous music)

01:01:16.410 --> 01:01:17.660
- I'm sorry, what?

01:01:17.660 --> 01:01:19.490
- Yeah, they were ancient scrolls

01:01:19.490 --> 01:01:20.800
of foretold--
- No, no, no, no, no.

01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:22.883
Fuck the scrolls, the other part.

01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:25.620
- The cryogenic freeze?

01:01:25.620 --> 01:01:28.550
- No, the part about my man jam!

01:01:28.550 --> 01:01:30.400
- Your semen will awaken Bruce Li,

01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:32.040
it is foretold, and so it shall be!

01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:34.140
- Wait, back to my dick snot for a second.

01:01:36.180 --> 01:01:38.860
- It also says when we awakens,

01:01:38.860 --> 01:01:40.780
we will have sex,

01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:42.973
and there will be an explosive orgasm,

01:01:44.130 --> 01:01:47.860
and that orgasm will mark the beginning

01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:49.663
of a new dawn of humanity!

01:01:51.620 --> 01:01:53.080
- I feel really faint right now.

01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:55.423
I think I need a candy bar or something.

01:01:58.320 --> 01:01:59.910
- I need you, Bart.

01:01:59.910 --> 01:02:01.203
Bruce needs you.

01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:04.563
America, what's left of it, needs you.

01:02:06.030 --> 01:02:07.080
You're the lynch pin.

01:02:08.270 --> 01:02:09.900
What do you say?

01:02:09.900 --> 01:02:13.340
- Oh, Dynastud, who can say no to you?

01:02:13.340 --> 01:02:14.500
- No one.

01:02:14.500 --> 01:02:15.513
That's my gift.

01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:17.373
And my curse.

01:02:18.510 --> 01:02:21.612
- I thought your banging dick
was your gift and your curse.

01:02:21.612 --> 01:02:23.330
- I've got a lot of gifts,

01:02:23.330 --> 01:02:24.493
and a lot of curses.

01:02:25.470 --> 01:02:27.170
That's what makes me irresistible.

01:02:28.060 --> 01:02:31.713
That is also my gift and my curse.

01:02:32.654 --> 01:02:35.154
(light music)

01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:41.380
- Can't I just suck you off a little bit?

01:02:41.380 --> 01:02:42.660
- No!

01:02:42.660 --> 01:02:43.763
It's too dangerous!

01:02:45.980 --> 01:02:48.020
Why don't I return the favor?

01:02:48.020 --> 01:02:49.084
- You mean?

01:02:49.084 --> 01:02:49.979
(zipper scratching)

01:02:49.979 --> 01:02:51.513
Damn, your smooth!

01:02:52.655 --> 01:02:56.488
(singing in foreign language)

01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:00.983
- Go fish.

01:03:03.347 --> 01:03:04.714
- Burn in hell.

01:03:04.714 --> 01:03:06.758
(gun shot booming)

01:03:06.758 --> 01:03:09.008
(thudding)

01:03:13.950 --> 01:03:16.720
- Shall I clean that up for you, sir?

01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:18.250
- No!

01:03:18.250 --> 01:03:20.940
Everyone's getting too
complacent around here.

01:03:20.940 --> 01:03:22.890
Leave him there as a warning to others.

01:03:24.090 --> 01:03:25.200
- Did, did you hear?

01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:27.230
Those two MAGA Agents were killed!

01:03:27.230 --> 01:03:28.063
- No!

01:03:29.230 --> 01:03:30.492
No!
(gun shot booming)

01:03:30.492 --> 01:03:31.545
No!

01:03:31.545 --> 01:03:32.696
No!

01:03:32.696 --> 01:03:33.867
No!

01:03:33.867 --> 01:03:37.390
(singing in foreign language)

01:03:37.390 --> 01:03:39.488
Who the fuck did that?

01:03:39.488 --> 01:03:40.460
- You did!

01:03:40.460 --> 01:03:42.350
- I did no such thing!

01:03:42.350 --> 01:03:44.940
- Daddy, I don't mean to criticize,

01:03:44.940 --> 01:03:46.883
but you might be kind of an asshole.

01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:50.040
- Well, nobody's gonna miss those two.

01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:51.960
We'll have 'em buried out in the backyard,

01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:55.053
next to your mother and the horse.

01:03:58.292 --> 01:04:00.459
(moaning)

01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:03.490
- Oh yeah!

01:04:03.490 --> 01:04:06.430
Oh, I've never felt
anything like this before!

01:04:06.430 --> 01:04:09.290
- Bart, your semen, it glows!

01:04:09.290 --> 01:04:10.740
You truly are the chosen one.

01:04:12.010 --> 01:04:13.100
- Hey!

01:04:13.100 --> 01:04:15.000
I feel used!

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:18.873
- Bart, with this seed will
grow a mighty tree of justice.

01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:22.640
- That's it, I've had enough of this.

01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:24.210
You got what you wanted from me,

01:04:24.210 --> 01:04:26.653
so my part of this story is over.

01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:29.580
- It's far from over, Bart.

01:04:29.580 --> 01:04:31.130
You're a hero deep down inside.

01:04:32.070 --> 01:04:34.290
Now, you can either go back to America

01:04:34.290 --> 01:04:36.820
and spend the rest of your life running,

01:04:36.820 --> 01:04:38.540
or you can join me

01:04:38.540 --> 01:04:40.340
and change the world for the better.

01:04:41.700 --> 01:04:42.763
The choice is yours.

01:04:44.190 --> 01:04:45.603
- I'll take my chances.

01:04:46.547 --> 01:04:49.297
(frogs croaking)

01:04:54.122 --> 01:04:56.590
(dark ominous music)

01:04:56.590 --> 01:04:58.663
- I should probably go
wash out my mouth now.

01:05:28.326 --> 01:05:29.820
(crunching)

01:05:29.820 --> 01:05:30.653
- Hello?

01:05:32.279 --> 01:05:33.393
Dynastud, is that you?

01:05:38.281 --> 01:05:41.364
(cell phone ringing)

01:05:47.063 --> 01:05:49.483
Looks like my luck's beginning to change.

01:05:50.368 --> 01:05:53.368
(suspenseful music)

01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:07.767
(gasping)

01:06:11.490 --> 01:06:14.043
- Hello, oneeyedyogurtslinger69.

01:06:14.940 --> 01:06:17.370
- Yeah, that's my username.

01:06:17.370 --> 01:06:19.160
You can call me Bart.

01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:20.680
- I am hot for you?

01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:21.710
- Sure.

01:06:21.710 --> 01:06:23.610
I didn't know this was a cruising spot.

01:06:23.610 --> 01:06:25.330
Seems a little out of the way.

01:06:25.330 --> 01:06:28.000
- I want to be woman for you.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.210
- Um, what?

01:06:29.210 --> 01:06:30.980
You want to?

01:06:30.980 --> 01:06:33.023
- All over my tits.

01:06:34.700 --> 01:06:35.993
- Are you feeling okay?

01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:39.003
- Wait, no.

01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:42.320
I want to be the man.

01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:44.283
You be the woman, right?

01:06:45.300 --> 01:06:47.160
- Are you new at this?

01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:50.462
- I want to submit to
your manly leadership.

01:06:50.462 --> 01:06:51.510
(gasping)

01:06:51.510 --> 01:06:54.177
(intense music)

01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:56.050
That was easy.

01:06:56.050 --> 01:06:58.700
All these guys care about
is getting their rocks off.

01:07:02.017 --> 01:07:04.267
(grunting)

01:07:05.755 --> 01:07:07.755
(thuds)

01:07:08.609 --> 01:07:10.859
(grunting)

01:07:12.203 --> 01:07:14.355
(electricity zapping)

01:07:14.355 --> 01:07:15.460
- Kick his ass, Bart!

01:07:15.460 --> 01:07:17.740
- I can't, I don't believe in violence.

01:07:17.740 --> 01:07:19.680
- Well, it's time to buck up, buckaroo!

01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:20.513
- I won't do it!

01:07:20.513 --> 01:07:23.390
- Time to go home and
fuck your wife, Bart.

01:07:23.390 --> 01:07:25.610
- They're gonna make
you fuck a woman, Bart!

01:07:25.610 --> 01:07:26.830
- It doesn't matter!

01:07:26.830 --> 01:07:27.763
I won't do it!

01:07:36.602 --> 01:07:37.575
(screaming)

01:07:37.575 --> 01:07:41.054
(electricity zapping)

01:07:41.054 --> 01:07:44.721
(squishy explosion popping)

01:07:48.204 --> 01:07:49.360
(rustling)

01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:52.860
- Bart, what's your problem?

01:07:52.860 --> 01:07:54.230
- Violence!

01:07:54.230 --> 01:07:55.430
I don't do that!

01:07:55.430 --> 01:07:57.230
You're the one who said
I was pure of heart,

01:07:57.230 --> 01:07:58.620
I mean, Christ!

01:07:58.620 --> 01:08:00.880
Do you want my semen to turn toxic?

01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:02.610
- I don't think that's how it works.

01:08:02.610 --> 01:08:05.490
- I've been taught to love, not to fight.

01:08:05.490 --> 01:08:07.320
- Well, sometimes fighting is necessary.

01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:09.780
It can actually be a great deal of fun.

01:08:09.780 --> 01:08:13.490
- That's no answer, or even a good excuse.

01:08:13.490 --> 01:08:17.479
- Look, my point is you
need to stop being a pussy,

01:08:17.479 --> 01:08:18.729
or you're gonna get hurt.

01:08:21.740 --> 01:08:24.341
- I think you're the one
who's afraid of being hurt.

01:08:24.341 --> 01:08:26.840
(footsteps crunching)

01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:28.740
- I'm not afraid of anything!

01:08:28.740 --> 01:08:30.529
I'm Dynastud!

01:08:30.529 --> 01:08:32.483
I'm a superhero, for God's sakes!

01:08:34.370 --> 01:08:35.683
I'm every man's nightmare.

01:08:37.330 --> 01:08:38.582
And every woman's dream.

01:08:39.834 --> 01:08:43.370
(frogs croaking)

01:08:43.370 --> 01:08:44.573
- Who the hell is it?

01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:46.790
What?!

01:08:46.790 --> 01:08:48.330
They're what?

01:08:48.330 --> 01:08:49.506
They're both dead?!

01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:52.950
Are you kidding me?

01:08:52.950 --> 01:08:54.823
Well, nice talk, adios.

01:08:56.265 --> 01:08:57.990
(sighs)

01:08:57.990 --> 01:08:59.740
Goddammit.

01:08:59.740 --> 01:09:02.310
I'm gonna have to do this myself.

01:09:02.310 --> 01:09:04.810
(eerie music)

01:09:08.490 --> 01:09:10.120
- Senator Hightower!

01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:11.966
- The fuck is wrong with you?!

01:09:11.966 --> 01:09:12.800
(coughing)

01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:15.359
- I was trying to be mysterious!

01:09:15.359 --> 01:09:17.689
Easy, I bruise, I bruise!

01:09:17.689 --> 01:09:19.109
- I'm here too, dad!

01:09:19.109 --> 01:09:20.600
- Fuck everything!

01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:22.510
(groaning)

01:09:22.510 --> 01:09:24.700
- I'm gonna bleed, I'm gonna bleed.

01:09:24.700 --> 01:09:25.779
- Where are we going?

01:09:25.779 --> 01:09:27.380
- You're not coming.

01:09:27.380 --> 01:09:29.330
- I never get to go anywhere,

01:09:29.330 --> 01:09:31.712
but this time, I am coming!

01:09:31.712 --> 01:09:33.200
(groaning)

01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:35.840
You are not going to leave me

01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:37.955
like you left mom!

01:09:37.955 --> 01:09:38.787
(groaning)

01:09:38.787 --> 01:09:42.229
I will kill this motherfucker

01:09:42.229 --> 01:09:44.417
before I let you do that!

01:09:44.417 --> 01:09:49.010
(banging)
(groaning)

01:09:49.010 --> 01:09:52.763
- I've cracked at least three ribs, Patty.

01:09:54.136 --> 01:09:56.320
And I'm blacking out.

01:09:56.320 --> 01:09:59.780
- Look, Patty, I'm sorry

01:09:59.780 --> 01:10:01.410
I wasn't there for you!

01:10:01.410 --> 01:10:04.820
- Don't you see, it's because
of you I am like this!

01:10:06.330 --> 01:10:08.700
I wanna be in your life, dad!

01:10:08.700 --> 01:10:10.430
Let me in!

01:10:10.430 --> 01:10:13.304
I love you!

01:10:13.304 --> 01:10:14.850
(speaking foreign language)

01:10:14.850 --> 01:10:17.188
- Come here, sugar lamb.

01:10:17.188 --> 01:10:19.771
(gentle music)

01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:25.750
Let's go get your homo husband.

01:10:27.779 --> 01:10:29.724
(whirring)

01:10:29.724 --> 01:10:32.362
- Ooh, it has one of those!
- Yeah!

01:10:32.362 --> 01:10:33.433
(squealing)

01:10:33.433 --> 01:10:34.266
Let's go.

01:10:37.966 --> 01:10:39.149
(thudding)

01:10:39.149 --> 01:10:42.899
(waterfall gently splashing)

01:10:45.290 --> 01:10:47.093
- Why are we stopping?

01:10:48.250 --> 01:10:49.083
- Look.

01:10:50.530 --> 01:10:51.380
- [Bart] Is that?

01:10:52.310 --> 01:10:53.153
- Winnipeg.

01:10:54.060 --> 01:10:55.873
Land of mystery and magic.

01:10:56.930 --> 01:10:59.130
But before we go any further,

01:10:59.130 --> 01:11:00.530
I need you to level with me.

01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:03.320
Why don't you like violence?

01:11:10.380 --> 01:11:12.003
Okay, this is happening.

01:11:13.490 --> 01:11:14.790
- When I was really young,

01:11:15.670 --> 01:11:17.860
my parents, they took
me to a Chuck E. Cheese.

01:11:17.860 --> 01:11:19.500
- Yes, I could see how that would do it.

01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:21.930
- No, that's not the whole story.

01:11:21.930 --> 01:11:22.980
When we were leaving,

01:11:24.230 --> 01:11:27.200
they were robbed and murdered
by a couple of thugs.

01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:28.710
- Hand over your wallet and your purse,

01:11:28.710 --> 01:11:29.543
and nobody gets hurt.

01:11:29.543 --> 01:11:31.090
- I beg your pardon?

01:11:31.090 --> 01:11:32.560
- Listen, we just want the cash.

01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:34.470
Give us the money, you can walk away.

01:11:34.470 --> 01:11:36.490
- This is a Gucci wallet.

01:11:36.490 --> 01:11:40.893
- And this is an Ivanka
Trump signature handbag.

01:11:42.030 --> 01:11:43.440
- I don't think you understand.

01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:44.550
I just want your money.

01:11:44.550 --> 01:11:46.900
Hand it over, or I'm
gonna ventilate your wife.

01:11:48.060 --> 01:11:51.120
- Look, my lobbyist
did not work tirelessly

01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:52.930
to repeal the estate tax laws,

01:11:52.930 --> 01:11:54.970
so I could keep all of
my father's inheritance,

01:11:54.970 --> 01:11:56.830
just to give it to some parasite

01:11:56.830 --> 01:11:58.470
looking for a free handout!

01:11:58.470 --> 01:12:00.832
- Just look at the two of you.

01:12:00.832 --> 01:12:02.950
I mean, I respect your
right to open carry,

01:12:02.950 --> 01:12:03.930
but you should know better

01:12:03.930 --> 01:12:07.113
never to threaten people
of our skin color.

01:12:08.190 --> 01:12:10.750
When you see people this pale,

01:12:10.750 --> 01:12:15.060
think of us like an orange
vest during hunting season.

01:12:15.060 --> 01:12:16.670
- I mean, really, let's talk about

01:12:16.670 --> 01:12:19.440
how trickle-down economics works.

01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:20.430
- Trickle this!

01:12:20.430 --> 01:12:21.263
(gun shot booming)

01:12:21.263 --> 01:12:22.270
- Whoa!

01:12:22.270 --> 01:12:23.990
Well, did you hunt these guys down

01:12:23.990 --> 01:12:26.310
and kill them in a most gruesome fashion?

01:12:26.310 --> 01:12:27.310
- No.

01:12:27.310 --> 01:12:28.730
I followed them home,

01:12:28.730 --> 01:12:31.400
and they kinda took pity
on me and adopted me.

01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:33.250
But they were really nice.

01:12:33.250 --> 01:12:34.560
- Uh.
- And then,

01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:36.400
in an even stranger turn of events,

01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:38.320
when we were leaving Build-A-Bear,

01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:41.060
they were robbed and murdered
by another group of thugs

01:12:41.060 --> 01:12:42.303
who weren't so nice.

01:12:45.140 --> 01:12:47.420
- Is this because of the
radioactive spider thing?

01:12:47.420 --> 01:12:49.840
Because I was just
busting your balls, Bart.

01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:51.803
- No, this actually happened!

01:12:53.780 --> 01:12:55.979
- Alright, we're losing
daylight, let's go.

01:12:55.979 --> 01:13:00.354
(waterfall gently splashing)

01:13:00.354 --> 01:13:03.771
(funky electronic music)

01:13:07.900 --> 01:13:09.263
- My God!

01:13:10.340 --> 01:13:12.480
Is that where Bruce Li is stored?!

01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:13.690
- In that spaceship?

01:13:13.690 --> 01:13:14.930
No, Bart.

01:13:14.930 --> 01:13:16.120
In order to get to Bruce Li,

01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:17.750
we must travel to the outer most reaches

01:13:17.750 --> 01:13:19.710
of our solar system.

01:13:19.710 --> 01:13:21.960
Our mission is just beginning.

01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:22.793
- Bitchin'!

01:13:24.617 --> 01:13:25.718
(spaceship whooshing)

01:13:25.718 --> 01:13:28.230
(intense music)

01:13:28.230 --> 01:13:30.372
- Now I think we should run!

01:13:30.372 --> 01:13:32.622
(cackling)

01:13:33.881 --> 01:13:35.815
(shouting)

01:13:35.815 --> 01:13:37.375
(lasers blasting)

01:13:37.375 --> 01:13:39.625
(laughing)

01:13:41.616 --> 01:13:43.320
(whirring)

01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:46.153
(lasers blasting)

01:13:48.140 --> 01:13:50.785
- Dynastud, we have something
coming up on our tail!

01:13:50.785 --> 01:13:52.550
(whooshing)

01:13:52.550 --> 01:13:53.483
- He found us.

01:13:57.510 --> 01:14:00.450
- Prepare to meet your maker.

01:14:00.450 --> 01:14:01.700
And in this case,

01:14:01.700 --> 01:14:03.783
your maker is me.

01:14:09.165 --> 01:14:12.480
- To the end, I grapple with thee!

01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:16.050
From hell's heart, I stab at thee!

01:14:16.050 --> 01:14:17.080
In the name of hate,

01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:19.723
I spit my last breath at thee!

01:14:20.690 --> 01:14:22.832
- When did you learn to read?

01:14:22.832 --> 01:14:25.048
(intense music)

01:14:25.048 --> 01:14:27.881
(lasers blasting)

01:14:35.535 --> 01:14:36.462
(explosion booming)

01:14:36.462 --> 01:14:38.462
- [Bart] We've been hit!

01:14:40.235 --> 01:14:41.990
- And lost power in the aft engines.

01:14:41.990 --> 01:14:44.950
We'll never make it to
the Canadian mothership.

01:14:44.950 --> 01:14:46.420
Unless.

01:14:46.420 --> 01:14:47.337
- Unless?!

01:14:48.440 --> 01:14:50.800
- You're going to have to blow me, Bart.

01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:51.633
It might kill you,

01:14:51.633 --> 01:14:54.000
but I may be able to redirect the force

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.260
of my orgasm into the ship's main engines,

01:14:56.260 --> 01:14:58.800
allowing us to go into hyper speed.

01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:00.406
- Aye aye, captain!

01:15:00.406 --> 01:15:02.906
(funky music)

01:15:06.070 --> 01:15:09.280
- This next shot will
rob them of their powers.

01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:10.840
Then we'll board the ship,

01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:12.560
kill Dynastud,

01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:14.910
and bring Bart back to Earth.

01:15:14.910 --> 01:15:16.773
And he can finally board you.

01:15:18.430 --> 01:15:20.793
- Glass doors open.

01:15:22.357 --> 01:15:24.370
(whooshing)

01:15:24.370 --> 01:15:25.670
- More tongue, you fucker!

01:15:27.366 --> 01:15:30.449
(missiles whooshing)

01:15:31.465 --> 01:15:32.379
(groaning)

01:15:32.379 --> 01:15:34.150
Ah, he shoots!

01:15:34.150 --> 01:15:35.676
Oh, he scores!

01:15:35.676 --> 01:15:37.843
(moaning)

01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:44.170
- Why is it so salty, why?!

01:15:44.170 --> 01:15:45.503
That can't be healthy!

01:15:48.060 --> 01:15:49.173
- Bart, we're here!

01:15:50.100 --> 01:15:54.040
Emergency Canadian maple
syrup space reserves!

01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:57.010
Billions and billions of
gallons are stored up in there,

01:15:57.010 --> 01:15:59.350
in case of the death of
the world's maple trees.

01:15:59.350 --> 01:16:02.460
- It tastes like liquid beef jerky.

01:16:02.460 --> 01:16:04.143
Is there any water on this ship?

01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:06.050
- Red Maple?

01:16:06.050 --> 01:16:07.020
Red Maple?

01:16:07.020 --> 01:16:08.430
This is Dynastud.

01:16:08.430 --> 01:16:10.170
Requesting permission to board.

01:16:10.170 --> 01:16:11.650
- [Red Maple] Permission granted.

01:16:11.650 --> 01:16:12.860
Welcome to the emergency

01:16:12.860 --> 01:16:15.710
Canadian maple syrup space reserves.

01:16:15.710 --> 01:16:18.072
The syrup must flow.

01:16:18.072 --> 01:16:21.322
(electronic bleeping)

01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:32.460
- Are all these filled with?

01:16:32.460 --> 01:16:34.230
- Pure maple syrup.

01:16:34.230 --> 01:16:37.040
The very lifeblood of
the Canadian economy.

01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:38.417
Welcome to the (speaking
foreign language).

01:16:41.236 --> 01:16:43.250
Ooh, and whatever you do,

01:16:43.250 --> 01:16:47.144
stay away from that big
button on the far wall.

01:16:47.144 --> 01:16:49.811
(ominous music)

01:17:04.330 --> 01:17:07.473
Funny, I never noticed the
naked Asian man until just now.

01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:16.730
- We'll take it from here.

01:17:16.730 --> 01:17:18.870
- Sorry, didn't mean to pry.

01:17:18.870 --> 01:17:21.353
If you need me, I'll be
watching my programs.

01:17:49.570 --> 01:17:51.893
- Welcome, Dynastud, my lover.

01:17:52.870 --> 01:17:54.713
I've returned to the world again.

01:17:56.200 --> 01:17:59.403
The wheel of destiny continues apace.

01:18:00.501 --> 01:18:03.668
(electronic bleeping)

01:18:06.669 --> 01:18:09.070
(sighs)

01:18:09.070 --> 01:18:12.290
- Bruce, this is Bart.

01:18:12.290 --> 01:18:14.560
I believe the one the prophecy's foretold.

01:18:14.560 --> 01:18:17.016
- He is certainly handsome.

01:18:17.016 --> 01:18:17.849
(whooshing)

01:18:17.849 --> 01:18:20.260
- Whoa, what was that?

01:18:20.260 --> 01:18:23.010
- Yes, and his heart is pure.

01:18:23.010 --> 01:18:25.610
- Just as the scrolls foretold.

01:18:25.610 --> 01:18:27.340
- Okay, look.

01:18:27.340 --> 01:18:28.500
I'm getting at pretty annoyed

01:18:28.500 --> 01:18:30.010
at not being told anything

01:18:30.010 --> 01:18:33.120
and just being batted around
like a pawn in your game!

01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:35.620
I want somebody to tell
me what's going (moaning).

01:18:37.820 --> 01:18:39.290
Oh, that felt so good.

01:18:39.290 --> 01:18:40.690
- Calmly, Bart.

01:18:40.690 --> 01:18:42.420
You must be calm.

01:18:42.420 --> 01:18:45.007
You deserve to know if
you're the hero we seek.

01:18:45.007 --> 01:18:46.601
(explosion booming)

01:18:46.601 --> 01:18:48.640
(kung-fu yelling)

01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:51.630
What in the name of the
Buddha is this shit?!

01:18:51.630 --> 01:18:53.148
(door whirring)

01:18:53.148 --> 01:18:55.470
(emergency alarm blaring)

01:18:55.470 --> 01:18:57.463
- We meet again, Dynastud.

01:18:58.650 --> 01:19:00.750
For the last time.

01:19:00.750 --> 01:19:02.220
- Hightower.

01:19:02.220 --> 01:19:06.080
- I'm here because you stole
away my daughter's husband.

01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:07.660
- Bart, you're married?

01:19:07.660 --> 01:19:09.420
- Not on purpose.

01:19:09.420 --> 01:19:10.640
- Okay.

01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:15.640
- Say goodbye to your
perverted ways, Dynastud.

01:19:15.938 --> 01:19:18.771
(lasers blasting)

01:19:19.730 --> 01:19:20.563
Well?

01:19:22.180 --> 01:19:25.573
- I kinda wanna watch football?

01:19:26.950 --> 01:19:29.300
And play video games with my brahs.

01:19:29.300 --> 01:19:30.173
- It worked!

01:19:31.019 --> 01:19:33.450
Dynastud is straight!

01:19:33.450 --> 01:19:35.200
- Dynastud, straight?!

01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:37.250
- What have you done with him, you fiends!

01:19:37.250 --> 01:19:39.560
- Whoa, everyone, just chill!

01:19:39.560 --> 01:19:42.060
- Now, with Dynastud straight,

01:19:42.060 --> 01:19:44.250
we can blast Bart and get him out of here

01:19:44.250 --> 01:19:47.070
and safely brainwashed and back to Patty.

01:19:47.070 --> 01:19:50.040
I've turned you straight, Dynastud.

01:19:50.040 --> 01:19:52.910
Now, you're going to
scratch your balls in public

01:19:53.870 --> 01:19:55.193
and not even care!

01:19:56.040 --> 01:19:59.480
You're not going to notice
other people's feelings,

01:19:59.480 --> 01:20:00.613
especially women.

01:20:01.500 --> 01:20:05.060
You're going to shit and not flush.

01:20:05.060 --> 01:20:08.040
And never do the dishes,

01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:09.987
and think to yourself,

01:20:09.987 --> 01:20:14.280
"Why are there no clean dishes?"

01:20:14.280 --> 01:20:16.643
What do you think of that?

01:20:18.550 --> 01:20:21.853
- I think you're a fucking idiot.

01:20:23.060 --> 01:20:24.530
- Oh yeah?

01:20:24.530 --> 01:20:25.620
Why?

01:20:25.620 --> 01:20:28.150
- Because you just turned me straight.

01:20:28.150 --> 01:20:30.140
You didn't turn me to your side,

01:20:30.140 --> 01:20:32.243
you didn't take away my superpowers.

01:20:33.700 --> 01:20:38.630
If anything, you amplified
them with undo aggression.

01:20:38.630 --> 01:20:39.807
- What are you doing?!

01:20:42.130 --> 01:20:44.853
- 100 billion gallons.

01:20:46.130 --> 01:20:48.343
- All pointed at America!

01:20:52.494 --> 01:20:54.088
Dynastud!

01:20:54.088 --> 01:20:56.350
If you push that button,

01:20:56.350 --> 01:20:59.270
it will flood all of America.

01:20:59.270 --> 01:21:01.100
Everything that we hold dear

01:21:01.100 --> 01:21:04.140
will wash away in a tide of maple.

01:21:04.140 --> 01:21:05.804
Everything!

01:21:05.804 --> 01:21:08.200
A class system nobody questions!

01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:12.190
Empty strip malls and
Starbucks on every corner,

01:21:12.190 --> 01:21:16.203
the biggest perpetual
war machine in the world.

01:21:17.720 --> 01:21:18.863
Come on, Dynastud.

01:21:20.140 --> 01:21:21.711
What do ya say?

01:21:21.711 --> 01:21:24.211
(eerie music)

01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:29.920
- Fuck it.

01:21:29.920 --> 01:21:31.301
I want pancakes.

01:21:31.301 --> 01:21:33.968
(alarm blaring)

01:21:37.402 --> 01:21:40.735
(maple syrup splashing)

01:21:42.155 --> 01:21:44.488
(screaming)

01:21:47.270 --> 01:21:50.380
- Ooh, I'm terribly sorry to
have to tell you about this,

01:21:50.380 --> 01:21:53.167
but everyone in America's dead now, eh?

01:21:54.489 --> 01:21:56.989
(eerie music)

01:22:00.810 --> 01:22:01.823
- Fuck it all.

01:22:07.848 --> 01:22:11.560
(electronic bleeping)

01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:13.513
One last dance.

01:22:14.940 --> 01:22:16.830
But first,

01:22:16.830 --> 01:22:20.291
I'm gonna send this little
faggot to the grave.

01:22:20.291 --> 01:22:21.336
(intense music)

01:22:21.336 --> 01:22:22.652
- No!

01:22:22.652 --> 01:22:24.637
(gun shots booming)

01:22:24.637 --> 01:22:26.960
(whooshing)

01:22:26.960 --> 01:22:28.240
- Gun-fu!

01:22:28.240 --> 01:22:30.635
(kung-fu shouting)

01:22:30.635 --> 01:22:33.627
(sharply exhaling)

01:22:33.627 --> 01:22:35.030
What are you doing?

01:22:35.030 --> 01:22:37.420
- Making America great again.

01:22:37.420 --> 01:22:38.670
- Wait!

01:22:38.670 --> 01:22:40.600
I'll give ya anything you need.

01:22:40.600 --> 01:22:41.793
Come to my side.

01:22:42.640 --> 01:22:44.783
- I'm gonna freeze your nomination.

01:22:45.990 --> 01:22:48.657
(ominous music)

01:22:52.514 --> 01:22:54.830
(door clanking)

01:22:54.830 --> 01:22:57.483
- Fuck your mother, Dynastud!

01:22:59.800 --> 01:23:00.650
- That's mothers!

01:23:01.930 --> 01:23:03.281
Motherfucker!

01:23:03.281 --> 01:23:06.448
(electronic bleeping)

01:23:10.400 --> 01:23:14.363
Hey, I'm very sorry about your dad.

01:23:15.550 --> 01:23:16.770
- No, don't sweat it.

01:23:16.770 --> 01:23:18.593
He was a total douche canoe.

01:23:19.580 --> 01:23:21.523
Anyway, I'm gonna head out.

01:23:23.020 --> 01:23:25.850
- So, remember the prophecy?

01:23:25.850 --> 01:23:27.771
Are we gonna fuck now or what?

01:23:27.771 --> 01:23:30.903
- Ooh, on second thought,
I am going to stay.

01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:33.150
- I can't.

01:23:33.150 --> 01:23:34.393
My Gaydar, gone!

01:23:35.330 --> 01:23:39.923
Instead in my head, a blueprint
of raping and pillaging.

01:23:43.890 --> 01:23:47.140
Come on, wake up, let's do this!

01:23:47.140 --> 01:23:48.053
I'm on top!

01:23:49.939 --> 01:23:51.550
(moaning)

01:23:51.550 --> 01:23:53.730
- Oh, you're so rough!

01:23:53.730 --> 01:23:55.450
And why the fuck do you suddenly smell

01:23:55.450 --> 01:23:56.963
like a bottle of Old Spice?

01:23:58.030 --> 01:23:58.863
- I don't know.

01:24:01.430 --> 01:24:05.663
Come on, let's do this!

01:24:05.663 --> 01:24:07.870
This never happens!

01:24:07.870 --> 01:24:08.740
- What do we do?!

01:24:08.740 --> 01:24:10.397
How do we make you gay again?!

01:24:11.235 --> 01:24:13.170
(funky music)

01:24:13.170 --> 01:24:14.313
- I can't do this.

01:24:18.060 --> 01:24:19.870
It has to be you, Bart.

01:24:19.870 --> 01:24:22.660
The prophecies must've
meant him all along!

01:24:22.660 --> 01:24:24.270
- What do you mean?

01:24:24.270 --> 01:24:25.853
- You've gotta Bruce Li, Bart.

01:24:28.970 --> 01:24:32.210
Bart, I never understood
your pacifist nature.

01:24:32.210 --> 01:24:34.310
But now it all makes sense.

01:24:34.310 --> 01:24:36.663
You see, Bart, you're a lover,

01:24:37.860 --> 01:24:38.693
not a fighter.

01:24:41.270 --> 01:24:44.093
- The world ain't gonna
unfuck itself, Bart.

01:24:45.218 --> 01:24:48.218
(light funky music)

01:24:52.240 --> 01:24:53.620
- Stand back, world!

01:24:53.620 --> 01:24:55.270
Bart's about to enter the dragon!

01:24:56.890 --> 01:25:00.333
- Okay, before we do this, can
I know something about you?

01:25:01.770 --> 01:25:03.450
- Well, I'm really into feet.

01:25:03.450 --> 01:25:05.913
- Yup, okay, we can stop there.

01:25:09.838 --> 01:25:13.005
(electronic bleeping)

01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:16.527
(moaning)

01:25:17.494 --> 01:25:19.740
(spitting)

01:25:19.740 --> 01:25:22.990
(groaning and moaning)

01:25:27.320 --> 01:25:28.830
- It's working!

01:25:28.830 --> 01:25:29.823
It's working!

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:32.730
- What the hell is that?

01:25:32.730 --> 01:25:35.780
- That's a rip forming in
the space time continuum!

01:25:35.780 --> 01:25:37.780
- Are you serious?!

01:25:37.780 --> 01:25:40.294
(whooshing)

01:25:40.294 --> 01:25:41.650
- Uh, Bart, Bruce,

01:25:41.650 --> 01:25:42.883
you're gonna have to work
a little harder at this,

01:25:42.883 --> 01:25:45.290
or else the vortex will
collapse on itself.

01:25:45.290 --> 01:25:47.720
- I'm doing the best I can here!

01:25:47.720 --> 01:25:49.290
- Yeah, he's good,

01:25:49.290 --> 01:25:51.050
but he's not Dyna-good.

01:25:51.050 --> 01:25:52.810
- Thanks a lot!

01:25:52.810 --> 01:25:54.950
- Dynastud, you'll have to join us!

01:25:54.950 --> 01:25:56.430
It's the only way!

01:25:56.430 --> 01:25:59.180
- I can't, I'm no longer gay!

01:25:59.180 --> 01:26:01.690
Besides, all I wanna do is
listen to country western music

01:26:01.690 --> 01:26:03.630
and hunt small animals.

01:26:03.630 --> 01:26:05.993
- All will be lost if you don't join us!

01:26:07.161 --> 01:26:09.110
(whooshing)

01:26:09.110 --> 01:26:11.310
- Well, are you gonna
save the world or not?

01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:16.622
- I want to, but I'm straight now.

01:26:16.622 --> 01:26:18.200
- Dynastud!

01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:19.890
You lovely fool!

01:26:19.890 --> 01:26:24.890
Don't you know, it's not
gay if a girl is watching!

01:26:24.950 --> 01:26:26.280
- Holy shit!

01:26:26.280 --> 01:26:28.330
Yeah, you're right, why
didn't I think of that?!

01:26:28.330 --> 01:26:30.350
- Oh, and if you don't hold their head

01:26:30.350 --> 01:26:31.350
when they're blowing you.

01:26:31.350 --> 01:26:32.190
- Okay, yeah, I get it.

01:26:32.190 --> 01:26:33.750
- And if the balls don't touch.

01:26:33.750 --> 01:26:35.550
- Alright, yeah, moving right along.

01:26:36.467 --> 01:26:37.300
(exhaling)

01:26:37.300 --> 01:26:40.300
(upbeat rock music)

01:26:50.338 --> 01:26:53.005
(belt whipping)

01:26:58.263 --> 01:27:00.513
(slapping)

01:27:11.078 --> 01:27:13.245
(moaning)

01:27:15.140 --> 01:27:17.677
- [Together] It is accomplished!

01:27:19.257 --> 01:27:21.507
(shouting)

01:27:26.320 --> 01:27:28.943
- A portal through time.

01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:33.300
Do you know what this means, Bart?

01:27:34.220 --> 01:27:36.130
- Actually, no.

01:27:36.130 --> 01:27:37.860
I don't know what this means.

01:27:37.860 --> 01:27:39.120
Where are we going to go?

01:27:39.120 --> 01:27:42.260
And when we get there,
what are we going to do?

01:27:42.260 --> 01:27:45.630
- For so long, our future was uncertain.

01:27:45.630 --> 01:27:47.540
But no longer.

01:27:47.540 --> 01:27:50.010
With this portal, we have the ability

01:27:50.010 --> 01:27:52.390
to go to those moments in history

01:27:52.390 --> 01:27:55.450
where our enemies sow the seeds of hate.

01:27:55.450 --> 01:27:59.060
And in their place, offer love.

01:27:59.060 --> 01:28:02.460
We will fight our enemies
across time itself

01:28:02.460 --> 01:28:05.110
to prove our love is valid.

01:28:05.110 --> 01:28:08.010
We will rewrite history,
so that it celebrates all

01:28:08.010 --> 01:28:10.303
and not just a privileged few.

01:28:11.820 --> 01:28:13.170
We will travel through time

01:28:14.010 --> 01:28:16.070
to ensure that humanity's legacy

01:28:16.070 --> 01:28:19.557
isn't a dark cloud, but a rainbow.

01:28:19.557 --> 01:28:21.210
(triumphant music)

01:28:21.210 --> 01:28:22.860
We're going to the past to ensure

01:28:22.860 --> 01:28:24.403
that ignorance stays there.

01:28:25.460 --> 01:28:29.100
This is our purpose.

01:28:29.100 --> 01:28:30.100
This is our mission.

01:28:30.950 --> 01:28:34.643
This is just the beginning.

01:28:34.643 --> 01:28:37.143
(light music)

01:28:40.860 --> 01:28:44.810
- But first, we can have a
six-way with ourselves, right?

01:28:44.810 --> 01:28:46.040
- Damn right.

01:28:46.040 --> 01:28:47.463
Then we can go save history.

01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:50.100
- Well, then.

01:28:50.100 --> 01:28:51.600
Let's do this.

01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:52.783
- I call dibs on me!

01:28:54.499 --> 01:28:57.416
(triumphant music)

01:29:33.803 --> 01:29:37.220

- Shit.

01:32:37.513 --> 01:32:39.800
Don't give me that!

01:32:39.800 --> 01:32:43.170
I'm disappointed in you, all of you!

01:32:43.170 --> 01:32:46.430
Even the ones who didn't
vote for the last asshole,

01:32:46.430 --> 01:32:47.830
and especially those of you

01:32:47.830 --> 01:32:50.060
who decided you had moral objections

01:32:50.060 --> 01:32:53.770
to pulling the lever for
the last asshole's opponent.

01:32:53.770 --> 01:32:55.570
Your high and mighty convictions

01:32:55.570 --> 01:32:58.190
helped put that asshole
in the White House.

01:32:58.190 --> 01:32:59.860
And look what that got you!

01:32:59.860 --> 01:33:02.680
Gave the slimy underbelly of this nation

01:33:02.680 --> 01:33:05.030
a wonderful opportunity to crawl out

01:33:05.030 --> 01:33:07.393
of their holes and be openly awful.

01:33:08.580 --> 01:33:10.030
You know better.

01:33:10.030 --> 01:33:11.703
I know you know better.

01:33:12.790 --> 01:33:16.130
And as for those of you who
did vote for the asshole,

01:33:16.130 --> 01:33:18.820
you need to get that
shit out of your system

01:33:18.820 --> 01:33:20.580
right the hell now!

01:33:20.580 --> 01:33:22.460
There's no room for your hate

01:33:22.460 --> 01:33:24.800
and intolerance and fear.

01:33:24.800 --> 01:33:26.240
Not in America!

01:33:26.240 --> 01:33:28.770
Not on the goddamn planet!

01:33:28.770 --> 01:33:30.580
Don't be awful!

01:33:30.580 --> 01:33:33.250
You got a couple of fellas
livin' next door to you,

01:33:33.250 --> 01:33:36.010
you don't like what they
get up to in their bedroom?

01:33:36.010 --> 01:33:38.800
Get on with your own damn life.

01:33:38.800 --> 01:33:40.230
If it makes you uncomfortable,

01:33:40.230 --> 01:33:42.700
it's because you're
payin' too much attention.

01:33:42.700 --> 01:33:45.800
Stop peepin' in other people's windows!

01:33:45.800 --> 01:33:48.160
Literally and figuratively.

01:33:48.160 --> 01:33:52.090
Those two fellas, what damn
bit of difference does it make

01:33:52.090 --> 01:33:54.090
to your day-to-day life

01:33:54.090 --> 01:33:56.220
if they're living
together next door to you

01:33:56.220 --> 01:33:59.010
or if they're married and
living next door to you.

01:33:59.010 --> 01:34:01.180
We're all just trying to live our lives.

01:34:01.180 --> 01:34:03.440
All of us, gay, straight,

01:34:03.440 --> 01:34:06.350
black, white, whatever the hell.

01:34:06.350 --> 01:34:08.880
We're all just trying to
find a little bit of love,

01:34:08.880 --> 01:34:10.483
a little bit of happiness.

01:34:11.510 --> 01:34:13.623
Don't be awful.

01:34:14.670 --> 01:34:16.510
I swear, it's like none of ya

01:34:16.510 --> 01:34:17.930
have the damn sense ya mommas

01:34:17.930 --> 01:34:20.230
worked so hard to beat into ya!

01:34:20.230 --> 01:34:23.050
We've all gotta live under this one roof.

01:34:23.050 --> 01:34:26.390
And that means we sure as hell
better learn to get along.

01:34:26.390 --> 01:34:28.130
You want the space force to shoot

01:34:28.130 --> 01:34:30.143
the people you don't like into the sun?

01:34:31.041 --> 01:34:32.910
And what happens when the tide turns,

01:34:32.910 --> 01:34:35.983
and suddenly, you're the
people that people don't like?

01:34:37.090 --> 01:34:39.930
Don't be awful.

01:34:39.930 --> 01:34:42.160
That's all it takes.

01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:44.580
And that's all I'm gonna say to you.

01:34:44.580 --> 01:34:47.171
You'd best not make me say it again.

01:34:47.171 --> 01:34:49.305
(light music)

01:34:50.305 --> 01:34:56.252
