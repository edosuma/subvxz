Forces Credit Union.

assigned to this?

You know, the wall is
not even load-bearing.

the United States Navy,

07:13.650 --> 07:15.130
Yeah, I'’d like that.

07:15.173 --> 07:16.827
As I suspected,
the markings

07:16.871 --> 07:18.394
on the chunk of stolen wall
is paint.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.222
More specifically,
spray paint.

07:20.265 --> 07:22.790
You had to test all these
to figure that out?

07:22.833 --> 07:25.706
No, I had to test all these to
figure out which brand was used.

07:25.749 --> 07:27.490
I had a hunch that
it might be important.

07:27.534 --> 07:30.188
Yeah
It was important.

07:30.232 --> 07:32.321
After testing
dozens of brands,

07:32.364 --> 07:34.541
and copping a decent
buzz in the process,

07:34.584 --> 07:36.499
I figured out our winner.

07:36.543 --> 07:39.415
"Kobra"?
Never heard of that.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.852
That'’s because Kobra
isn'’t sold in stores.

07:41.896 --> 07:43.245
It'’s only sold online,

07:43.288 --> 07:45.508
and marketed exclusively
to street artists.

07:45.552 --> 07:48.250

09:29.656 --> 09:31.527
Come take a look.Ritz?

09:31.571 --> 09:34.008
Yeah, he'’s like the
Picasso of street art.

09:34.051 --> 09:35.792
You think he'’s here?

09:35.836 --> 09:37.881
Wouldn'’t know if he was;
he keeps his identity secret.

09:37.925 --> 09:39.056
It'’s part of
his mystique.

09:39.100 --> 09:40.667
He'’s like Batman.

09:40.710 --> 09:42.886
Yeah, but Batman doesn'’t
deface government property.

09:42.930 --> 09:44.714
I didn'’t say
he isBatman.

09:44.758 --> 09:48.109

Yep.

Feel free to look
the piece over.

10:00.164 --> 10:03.994

other interested parties.

Hey, are you guys here
for the feminist urinal?

10:08.477 --> 10:09.913
What are you doing?

10:09.957 --> 10:13.482
Well, Ritz is
known for hiding

10:13.525 --> 10:16.790
secret messages
in his art.

10:19.314 --> 10:21.795

Looking for Ritz'’s message?

What?

10:31.979 --> 10:33.633
What the hell was that?

10:36.418 --> 10:38.681
Ritz embeds QR codes
into all of his art.

10:38.725 --> 10:40.683
It'’s like a
high-tech barcode

10:40.727 --> 10:43.033
that automatically
links to a website.

10:43.077 --> 10:44.644
Today he'’s saving
the whales.

10:44.687 --> 10:47.342
Last month it was
the spotted owl.

10:47.385 --> 10:49.431
So he'’s, like,
an animal rights activist?

10:49.474 --> 10:52.782
Some say activist,
others say extremist.

10:52.826 --> 10:54.436
He'’s street art's bad boy.

10:54.479 --> 10:57.439
Made a lot of enemies.

10:57.482 --> 11:01.138
Bishop, this wall is incredible.

11:08.102 --> 11:10.626
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Don'’t go past the rope, sir.

11:10.670 --> 11:11.758
Sir?

11:11.801 --> 11:13.107
I'’m-I'm sorry.

11:13.150 --> 11:15.413
I'’m just trying
to protect my wall.

11:17.851 --> 11:20.157
Yeah, no.

11:20.201 --> 11:21.681
My wall.

11:23.204 --> 11:25.293
NCIS.

11:25.336 --> 11:28.078
Hey. Ran a search on Ritz.

11:28.122 --> 11:30.472
Got a hit on the Feds'’
criminal watch list.

11:30.515 --> 11:31.821
FBI'’s looking for this guy?

11:31.865 --> 11:33.693
No. Not those Feds.

11:33.736 --> 11:35.825
Then who?

11:35.869 --> 11:38.306
The U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service?

11:38.349 --> 11:40.787
This is why I canceled my lunch
with the assistant secretary?

11:40.830 --> 11:43.311
This street artist targeted
a Navy bank for a reason.

11:43.354 --> 11:44.747
I want to know
why, Leon.

11:44.791 --> 11:46.488
Up.

11:46.531 --> 11:47.968
Director Webb.

11:48.011 --> 11:49.665
Hello. Thank you
for your time.

11:49.709 --> 11:52.146
Anything I can do
to help put Ritz behind bars.

11:52.189 --> 11:54.148
He put our agency through hell.How?

11:54.191 --> 11:56.411
A few months back, he
spray-painted a bloody giraffe

11:56.454 --> 11:58.065
on the front of our building.

11:58.108 --> 12:00.241
And encrypted
in the painting was a...

12:00.284 --> 12:01.372
QR code.

12:01.416 --> 12:02.896
What was the message?

12:02.939 --> 12:04.811
Ritz demanded we cut ties

12:04.854 --> 12:06.726
with the Berry Brothers
Company, or else.

12:07.727 --> 12:09.076
The Berry Brothers?

12:09.119 --> 12:11.078
For a fee,
they let us use their property

12:11.121 --> 12:13.254
to relocate black bears
found near our cities.

12:13.297 --> 12:14.298
Why is that a bad thing?

12:14.342 --> 12:15.647
The money we gave the Berries

12:15.691 --> 12:16.953
helped fund their realbusiness,

12:16.997 --> 12:18.781
escorting the wealthy
to South Africa

12:18.825 --> 12:20.000
to hunt big game.

12:20.043 --> 12:21.871
Like giraffes?

12:21.915 --> 12:24.091
Ritz demanded we cut our ties
with the company.

12:24.134 --> 12:25.222
And when we didn'’t,

12:25.266 --> 12:27.137
he leaked private
e-mails and texts

12:27.181 --> 12:29.270
sent by agency personnel.Well, how did he get '’em?

12:29.313 --> 12:30.575
Wish I knew.

12:30.619 --> 12:32.664
He had us all scared
for our lives.

12:32.708 --> 12:35.319
Did you ever ask the FBI
to figure out who Ritz is?

12:35.363 --> 12:36.581
Didn'’t have to.

12:36.625 --> 12:38.192
We found a digital trail
leading us

12:38.235 --> 12:40.455
right to Ritz, aka Jared Clarke.

12:40.498 --> 12:41.804
And did you have him arrested?

12:41.848 --> 12:44.241
No. Ritz has a platform

12:44.285 --> 12:46.374
to reach millions,
and he'’s ruthless.

12:46.417 --> 12:48.593
We didn'’t want
to throw gasoline on the fire.

12:48.637 --> 12:51.422
And if I were you, I'’d really
think hard before you do.

12:51.466 --> 12:52.815
We'’re gonna be okay.

12:52.859 --> 12:54.643
Give us what you
got on Clarke.

12:54.686 --> 12:56.210
We'’re bringing him in.

12:58.908 --> 13:01.519
You know, I really don'’t
get the appeal of a rave

13:01.563 --> 13:04.740
on a Tuesday afternoon.I don'’t get the appeal
of a rave ever.

13:04.784 --> 13:07.525
Really? You must be going
to the wrong raves.

13:09.789 --> 13:11.834
Federal agents!

13:11.878 --> 13:14.054
Jared Clarke!

13:14.097 --> 13:16.839
Pretty sure this is
the right place.

13:25.805 --> 13:27.589
NCIS.

13:27.632 --> 13:30.026
Jared, show me
your hands.

13:41.472 --> 13:44.214
♪

13:54.485 --> 13:56.487
McGEE:
Jared Clarke, A.K.A. Ritz.

13:56.531 --> 13:58.620
He made an enemy
with every piece he tagged.

13:58.663 --> 14:00.970
No wonder he wanted to keep
his identity a secret.

14:01.014 --> 14:02.798
TORRES: Someone must have
found out who he was.

14:02.842 --> 14:04.626
Who? I want a name.

14:04.669 --> 14:05.975
Well, uh, there'’s been 28 pieces

14:06.019 --> 14:07.455
of street art
attributed to Ritz.

14:07.498 --> 14:10.153
All targeting
multinational corporations,

14:10.197 --> 14:12.547
elected officials,
even some charities.

14:12.590 --> 14:14.810
That is a very long list
of suspects.

14:14.854 --> 14:16.290
Narrow it down.

14:16.333 --> 14:18.292
What about the curator?

14:18.335 --> 14:19.293
McGEE:
His story checks out.

14:19.336 --> 14:20.555
He had just
hired two punks

14:20.598 --> 14:22.470
to steal Ritz'’s art
so he could sell it.

14:22.513 --> 14:23.993
They'’ve all been charged
with vandalism.

14:24.037 --> 14:25.560
TORRES:
But why kill Ritz?

14:25.603 --> 14:26.691
He was his golden goose.

14:26.735 --> 14:27.997
I think I got something.

14:28.041 --> 14:31.044
Former Maryland State Senator
Brady Spencer.

14:31.087 --> 14:32.306
I remember that guy.

14:32.349 --> 14:34.134
He got caught taking payoffs
from gas companies

14:34.177 --> 14:35.657
who wanted offshore drilling.

14:36.876 --> 14:38.878
Ritz is the one who exposed him.

14:38.921 --> 14:40.749
And the QR code
in this painting

14:40.792 --> 14:42.838
is linked
to secret bank transfers.

14:42.882 --> 14:44.971
Pretty much ended
his political career.

14:45.014 --> 14:45.928
Where is he now?

14:49.714 --> 14:52.500
TORRES:
Cemetery.

14:52.543 --> 14:55.459
Killed himself last year,
after the scandal broke open.

14:55.503 --> 14:57.461
Find a suspect.

14:57.505 --> 14:59.289
A live one.

15:02.553 --> 15:04.381
As a fan of fine art,

15:04.425 --> 15:08.255
I can say that his landscape
work is, uh, it'’s untouchable.

15:08.298 --> 15:11.519
Picasso, Warhol, those guys,
th-they get all the love.

15:11.562 --> 15:17.133
But if you ask me, Bob Ross
is in a league of his own.

15:17.177 --> 15:19.570
I'’ll second that.

15:21.137 --> 15:24.227
There is no such thing
as mistakes.

15:24.271 --> 15:25.663
Only happy accidents.

15:25.707 --> 15:28.753
Dr. Mallard,
it has been too long.

15:28.797 --> 15:30.973
Far too long.

15:31.017 --> 15:32.627
How'’s the book tour going?

15:32.670 --> 15:34.846
Oh, it'’s gone.
Over. Finished.

15:34.890 --> 15:36.848
And I can'’t say I'm sorry.

15:36.892 --> 15:39.242
Really? I thought
you'’d be having a blast
out there on the road.

15:39.286 --> 15:43.464
Well, the meeting people, book
signing, that part I enjoyed.

15:43.507 --> 15:46.858
It was the speaking
engagements I found tedious.

15:46.902 --> 15:49.992
Yes, yes, I know there are some
people that crave the stage,

15:50.036 --> 15:54.866
but I'’ve never been one to enjoy
the sound of my own voice.

15:54.910 --> 15:57.521
Of course not, Doctor.So...

15:57.565 --> 16:01.917
this is the fellow
you called me about.

16:01.961 --> 16:05.529
Well, his demise was certainly
not void of flair.

16:05.573 --> 16:07.227
JIMMY:
Yeah, and neither was his life.

16:07.270 --> 16:09.925
This is the famous street artist
known as Ritz.

16:09.969 --> 16:12.797
Or at least he was before he
took five rounds to the chest.

16:12.841 --> 16:14.538
Well, that'’s overkill.

16:14.582 --> 16:16.758
Yeah, just like the copious
amounts of spray paint.

16:16.801 --> 16:18.238
All applied postmortem.

16:18.281 --> 16:22.111
And you summoned me because
you'’re wondering why.

16:22.155 --> 16:24.026
No, no. Uh, my working theory

16:24.070 --> 16:26.594
is that this was
a crime of passion.

16:26.637 --> 16:29.771
The killer doused him in paint
because of some vendetta he had

16:29.814 --> 16:31.425
with Ritz about his art.

16:31.468 --> 16:33.122
Well, that'’s reasonable.

16:33.166 --> 16:37.561
But there is one thing
that has me totally baffled.

16:46.440 --> 16:48.050
Burnt ash?

16:48.094 --> 16:52.272
Possibly from the victim'’s
fireplace, but why?

16:52.315 --> 16:54.404
I haven'’t a clue.

16:54.448 --> 16:57.190
Yet.

16:59.235 --> 17:01.194
GIBBS: Hey, what do
you got this time?

17:01.237 --> 17:03.065
Ugh, disappointment.

17:03.109 --> 17:04.719
What? I thought you
said you had something.

17:04.762 --> 17:06.634
Oh, I do. I'’ve been,
uh, scrubbing through

17:06.677 --> 17:08.070
Jared Clarke'’s laptop,

17:08.114 --> 17:10.203
and I found a ton
that will help our case.

17:10.246 --> 17:13.032
But I'’m bummed because it turns
out the world-famous Ritz

17:13.075 --> 17:15.034
is a world-class jerk.

17:15.077 --> 17:17.079
Rule 73: never
meet your heroes.

17:17.123 --> 17:19.777
Or at least never scroll through
their browser history.

17:19.821 --> 17:21.779
Unless it'’s your job.

17:21.823 --> 17:23.259
The great and powerful Ritz

17:23.303 --> 17:26.088
has been taking advantage
of his loyal fans.

17:26.132 --> 17:30.049
He sets up crowdfunding pages
to fund his art projects.

17:30.092 --> 17:31.659
But then uses the money
to finance

17:31.702 --> 17:33.704
his hipster-trendy lifestyle.

17:33.748 --> 17:36.272
Condo, the clothes,
the beard.

17:36.316 --> 17:38.448
Beggar with a laptop.His fans
donate in droves

17:38.492 --> 17:40.972
expecting the money to
go towards the causes

17:41.016 --> 17:43.975
and the charities
that Ritz champions in his art.

17:44.019 --> 17:45.586
But it doesn'’t.

17:45.629 --> 17:46.848
Beggar and a cheat.

17:46.891 --> 17:49.155
Imagine if a fan found out.

17:49.198 --> 17:50.460
Well, I'’m doing more
than imagining.

17:50.504 --> 17:52.462
Good. Because a fan found out.

17:52.506 --> 17:55.465
A user named mk187
has been sending Ritz

17:55.509 --> 17:57.815
a ton of private messages.

17:57.859 --> 17:59.469
And not the nice kind.

17:59.513 --> 18:01.254
"You better stop, or else."

18:01.297 --> 18:03.169
"You'’re gonna pay for this."

18:03.212 --> 18:04.344
That sounds
like a motive.

18:04.387 --> 18:06.607
This is the last message
that was sent:

18:06.650 --> 18:09.000
"I know exactly
who you are, Jared."

18:09.044 --> 18:11.786
Jared?Oh, mk187 wasn'’t joking

18:11.829 --> 18:13.657
when she said she knew
exactly who he was.

18:13.701 --> 18:14.876
"She"?

18:14.919 --> 18:16.530
Oh, sorry. Spoiler alert.

18:16.573 --> 18:19.359
I traced the I.P. address to
the home of Melanie Keller.

18:19.402 --> 18:21.448
The M.K. in mk187.

18:21.491 --> 18:22.971
Send the address
to Bishop.

18:23.014 --> 18:24.842
I'’m pretty sure the 1-8-7
is in reference

18:24.886 --> 18:26.670
to the police code for...

18:27.932 --> 18:29.325
...murder.

18:29.369 --> 18:31.675
Wow, it'’s been a minute
since I'’ve seen

18:31.719 --> 18:35.375
those plastic flamingo thingies
outside anyone'’s home.

18:35.418 --> 18:36.637
Got a problem
with flamingos?

18:36.680 --> 18:38.378
Eh, no, there'’s
just a lot of them.

18:40.206 --> 18:43.383
Can'’t ever have
too many flamingos.

18:44.732 --> 18:46.690
Go.

18:52.131 --> 18:55.438
[ignition clicking
and sputtering]

18:58.441 --> 19:00.139
Hi, Melanie.

19:02.010 --> 19:04.099
NCIS.

19:04.143 --> 19:05.796
Got any jumper cables?

19:16.459 --> 19:18.505
I didn'’t do it.You didn'’t do what?

19:18.548 --> 19:19.984
Whatever you think I did.

19:20.028 --> 19:22.030
That why you ran?

19:22.073 --> 19:24.685
You know, I heard that they were
having a sale at Walmart,

19:24.728 --> 19:27.122
and I had to pick up
a few things.Really?

19:27.166 --> 19:28.515
More plastic flamingos?

19:28.558 --> 19:31.474
You can never have
too many flamingos.

19:34.695 --> 19:36.958
I like to leave the windows open

19:37.001 --> 19:39.569
so I can hear if I have
uninvited guests.

19:41.745 --> 19:44.052
Gives me a head start.

19:44.095 --> 19:45.836
To a Jeep with a dead battery?

19:49.057 --> 19:51.146
Does he look familiar?

19:52.843 --> 19:55.455
Nope.Okay.

19:55.498 --> 19:58.153
How about now?

20:02.113 --> 20:03.898
No.

20:03.941 --> 20:06.553
Who is he, and what
does he have to do with me?

20:06.596 --> 20:07.902
Jared Clarke.

20:07.945 --> 20:09.991
A.K.A. Ritz.

20:10.034 --> 20:11.688
The artist that you were sending
online threats to

20:11.732 --> 20:13.168
the day before he was killed.

20:13.212 --> 20:15.649
You think I killed Ritz?

20:15.692 --> 20:17.651
That'’s impossible.

20:22.221 --> 20:24.048
I am Ritz.

20:35.843 --> 20:38.672
Anyone can claim to be
the Dread Pirate Roberts.

20:38.715 --> 20:41.065
I mean, that'’s
the whole point, right

20:41.109 --> 20:44.025
Come on, Gibbs.
The Princess Bride?

20:44.068 --> 20:47.289
Yeah. Yeah, I know.
It'’s just been a while.

20:47.333 --> 20:50.597
No one knows who the famous
artist Ritz actually is,

20:50.640 --> 20:53.556
so anyone could claim
to be him, or her.

20:53.600 --> 20:55.689
Look, these pictures
of Melanie standing next

20:55.732 --> 20:57.691
to Ritz'’s artwork
could easily be faked.

20:59.432 --> 21:01.521
Yes.Are they?

21:01.564 --> 21:03.827
No.Oh, you had Kasie run them.

21:03.871 --> 21:08.354
Yes.So you'’re already convinced
that Melanie is the real Ritz.

21:08.397 --> 21:10.356
No.Okay, so how
about we drop

21:10.399 --> 21:11.835
the one-word answers
and talk about

21:11.879 --> 21:13.272
how the hell we'’re
gonna prove a negative.

21:13.315 --> 21:16.187
Yes.
Good talk.

21:16.231 --> 21:18.102
Vapor.

21:18.146 --> 21:20.496
Uh... sorry.
What color?

21:20.540 --> 21:22.759
Vapor.

21:22.803 --> 21:24.761
Okay, and that would be...?

21:24.805 --> 21:26.067
Ugly-ass blue.

21:27.286 --> 21:29.375
Wow. Is that...?

21:29.418 --> 21:31.942
Yes, me and Gibbs.
It'’s so cool, huh?

21:33.074 --> 21:35.119
Thanks.

21:35.163 --> 21:37.208
So what
about you, boss man?

21:37.252 --> 21:38.558
You believe me yet?

21:38.601 --> 21:40.516
BISHOP:
She'’s the real deal, Gibbs.

21:40.560 --> 21:42.344
I mean, this-this is Ritz.
I'’d bet my life on it.

21:42.388 --> 21:44.346
SLOANE: That would
look great in my office.

21:44.390 --> 21:47.393
Or in a courtroom,
as evidence in a murder trial.

21:47.436 --> 21:50.047
I didn'’t kill Jared Clarke.

21:50.091 --> 21:53.355
You said you were going to.It was just a threat. Online.

21:53.399 --> 21:56.097
I found out he was posing
as me for over year,

21:56.140 --> 21:57.707
bilking money from fans--
my fans.

21:57.751 --> 21:59.274
I was pissed, man.

21:59.318 --> 22:01.885
I never actually considered
killing the dude.

22:01.929 --> 22:04.366
And I have a rock-solid alibi
anyway. Ask Bish.

22:04.410 --> 22:06.237
Bish?
Bish, yeah.

22:06.281 --> 22:08.762
That'’s what she's been
calling me. Um...

22:08.805 --> 22:13.375
GPS on her phone confirms
that she was out of town, so...

22:13.419 --> 22:14.898
Didn'’t kill anyone.

22:14.942 --> 22:16.378
But you guys should relax.

22:16.422 --> 22:18.337
I already told Bish who did.

22:20.121 --> 22:22.297
VANCE: Treble Integrated
Defense Systems.

22:22.341 --> 22:24.081
They'’re the Navy's sole supplier

22:24.125 --> 22:25.561
of LFA components.

22:25.605 --> 22:27.128
Low Frequency Active Sonar.

22:27.171 --> 22:29.260
Ever since the Navy got in bed
with Treble,

22:29.304 --> 22:31.393
bad things have been
happening to ocean life.

22:31.437 --> 22:34.222
Cool pics.
I know.

22:34.265 --> 22:36.137
The Treble LFA systems
have been installed

22:36.180 --> 22:38.269
on hundreds
of submarines and ships.

22:38.313 --> 22:41.229
Thousands of marine mammals
have been screwed up ever since.

22:41.272 --> 22:43.274
We'’re talking
altered migration patterns,

22:43.318 --> 22:45.407
low-level birth rates.
Many have died.

22:45.451 --> 22:46.843
How do you feel about that,
Director?

22:46.887 --> 22:48.802
Hey, uh, we'’re trying
to help you here.

22:48.845 --> 22:51.413
I don'’t need help. I didn't
kill anybody. Treble did.

22:51.457 --> 22:53.067
Would you care to explain that,
Miss Keller?

22:53.110 --> 22:57.201
My work. I'’ve exposed
and taken down dozens

22:57.245 --> 22:58.986
of corrupt companies.

22:59.029 --> 23:00.466
I started looking into Treble,
and they panicked.

23:00.509 --> 23:02.032
They tried to off me.

23:02.076 --> 23:03.904
But killed
an imposter instead.

23:03.947 --> 23:06.689
End of story.
No. It'’s not.

23:06.733 --> 23:08.125
And you do need help.

23:08.169 --> 23:09.997
How do you figure?

23:10.040 --> 23:12.521
If we could find the real Ritz,
so could the killer.

23:12.565 --> 23:14.218
Your life is still in danger.

23:16.395 --> 23:19.093
Thank you, Miss Keller.

23:19.136 --> 23:20.486
Here, come on.

23:27.493 --> 23:30.974
I don'’t trust her, but
she'’s not wrong, Gibbs.

23:31.018 --> 23:32.976
Which part?

23:33.020 --> 23:35.762
Marine mammals are dying,
but we don'’t know why.

23:35.805 --> 23:38.329
Treble Systems.

23:38.373 --> 23:40.810
Yeah, Navy did its testing.
Everything checked out.

23:40.854 --> 23:43.422
So, marine life shouldn'’t be
affected, but for some reason,

23:43.465 --> 23:44.814
dolphins and whales are dying.

23:44.858 --> 23:46.337
Are we missing something?

23:46.381 --> 23:47.991
Like a cover

23:48.035 --> 23:50.777
That would be
motive for murder.

23:50.820 --> 23:53.475
We need to check
Treble'’s sonar ourselves.

23:55.042 --> 23:59.089
The USS Laurentis in
dry dock in Norfolk.

23:59.133 --> 24:00.830
I'’ll call the admiral this
afternoon for clearance

24:00.874 --> 24:02.789
to pull its LFA.
He'’ll be happy to help.

24:02.832 --> 24:05.182
Might want to make
that call now, Director.

24:05.226 --> 24:06.923
You sent agents there already.

24:08.534 --> 24:10.187
Of course you did.

24:17.151 --> 24:19.153
I think your pen'’s broken.

24:19.196 --> 24:22.373
"To Bish.

24:22.417 --> 24:24.158
"Thanks for not
putting one in my head.

24:24.201 --> 24:26.116
Your pal, Ritz."

24:26.160 --> 24:27.509
U.V. ink.

24:27.553 --> 24:30.207
Oh, black light, huh?

24:30.251 --> 24:32.688
Yeah, I don'’t... I don't sign my
paintings with anything else.

24:32.732 --> 24:35.212
I don'’t want to distract
from the power of the work.

24:38.259 --> 24:41.697
It'’s about my art,
it'’s not about me.

24:41.741 --> 24:47.094
I think they call that
a humble-brag.

24:47.137 --> 24:51.315
Man, you made me look
like a total badass.

24:51.359 --> 24:54.057
This is pretty awesome. Thanks.

24:54.101 --> 24:56.712
Yeah, it'’s been a long time
since I'’ve painted anything

24:56.756 --> 24:59.280
without fins or fur.

24:59.323 --> 25:04.459
So, what came first, Ritz the
artist or Ritz the activist?

25:04.503 --> 25:08.245
Well, my mom basically raised me
on an anti-whaling ship.

25:08.289 --> 25:11.248
So, thanks to her,
I was born an activist.

25:11.292 --> 25:14.556
I think Uncle Sam has
a different word to describe me.

25:14.600 --> 25:16.471
Extremist.

25:16.515 --> 25:18.560
I think art'’s in the eye
of the beholder.

25:18.604 --> 25:22.259
To my government, I'’m an
aerosol-packing terrorist,

25:22.303 --> 25:25.567
and Icelandic polar bears have
a slightly more favorable view.

25:25.611 --> 25:27.264
They get me.

25:27.308 --> 25:30.616
On behalf of Feds everywhere,
let me just say

25:30.659 --> 25:32.966
I have a lot of respect
for what you do.

25:33.009 --> 25:35.925
That'’s 'cause
you'’re an artist.

25:35.969 --> 25:38.362
I watched your eyes tracking the
painting when you first saw it,

25:38.406 --> 25:39.538
studying the color.

25:41.365 --> 25:43.411
Come on, only an artist
would do that.

25:43.454 --> 25:48.721
Mm, no, I am not much
of an artist anymore.

25:48.764 --> 25:52.899
I mean, I haven'’t picked up
a brush in months, so...

25:52.942 --> 25:54.030
Why'’s that?

25:54.074 --> 25:56.206
Uh, I don'’t know.

25:56.250 --> 25:59.862
Um, this job, I guess.

25:59.906 --> 26:03.213
Life'’s been pretty
crappy recently.

26:03.257 --> 26:07.304
Um, I had a-a really good friend
who died last year,

26:07.348 --> 26:10.525
and... I haven'’t painted since.

26:10.569 --> 26:11.787
Sorry to hear that.

26:11.831 --> 26:15.530
I have a theory
for most artists.

26:17.184 --> 26:20.056
When life is good, paint.

26:20.100 --> 26:22.929
When life goes to hell,
paint more.

26:22.972 --> 26:25.627
No better outlet than art.Even for you?

26:25.671 --> 26:27.890
Eh, for me,
art'’s a means to an end.

26:27.934 --> 26:31.111
Spraying paint is
my humble effort to try

26:31.154 --> 26:33.722
and make this place a little bit
better than I found it.

26:33.766 --> 26:36.246
I don'’t really see myself
tagging walls

26:36.290 --> 26:37.944
to make a difference
anytime soon.

26:37.987 --> 26:39.989
That'’s your tool for that.

26:40.033 --> 26:42.818
Your art...

26:42.862 --> 26:44.951
that'’s just for you.

26:44.994 --> 26:48.432
You'’re right. I should
start up again sometime soon.

26:56.571 --> 26:58.355
Uh...

27:03.709 --> 27:06.363
Carpe diem, Bish.

27:06.407 --> 27:09.889
Wha
Like, in front of you?

27:12.892 --> 27:14.894
I don'’t even know how to tag.

27:14.937 --> 27:17.548
Point. Spray.

27:19.420 --> 27:21.814
Uh... another time.

27:23.250 --> 27:25.382
I appreciate
what you'’re trying to do,

27:25.426 --> 27:27.907
but I have a case
to solve, so...

27:36.089 --> 27:39.527
Okay, ready when you are, McGee.

27:39.570 --> 27:42.443
Yeah, I'’m ready.So, according to Treble,

27:42.486 --> 27:45.794
this sonar system only
operates up to the restricted

27:45.838 --> 27:49.145
decibel level of 235.

27:49.189 --> 27:52.322
Anything above that has the
potential to harm marine life.

27:52.366 --> 27:54.150
Right, McGee?

27:55.630 --> 27:58.981
Okay.
Here goes nothing.

28:04.813 --> 28:06.467
:
Is it working?

28:08.034 --> 28:10.471
Yeah, it'’s working.

28:10.514 --> 28:13.474
The meter on the machine says
that it'’s operating

28:13.517 --> 28:16.390
right at the approved
235 decibels.

28:16.433 --> 28:18.827
No, mine

28:20.307 --> 28:22.309
311

28:22.352 --> 28:24.050
Uh, what'’s 311?

28:24.093 --> 28:26.617
: Bishop, you should be
wearing ear protection!

28:26.661 --> 28:27.880
Whoa, whoa.

28:27.923 --> 28:29.751
Not if you two
stop yelling. Geez.

28:29.795 --> 28:31.361
What'’s 311 mean?

28:31.405 --> 28:34.974
Well, the sonar machine is set
to deliver a maximum output

28:35.017 --> 28:37.846
of 235 decibels;
that'’s standard regulation.

28:37.890 --> 28:39.935
And the readout on the machine
says that it'’s topped off

28:39.979 --> 28:41.110
right at 235.

28:41.154 --> 28:42.546
But according to
our decibel meter,

28:42.590 --> 28:44.635
the output is much higher.

28:44.679 --> 28:46.725
High enough to affect
ocean life?
Oh, yeah.

28:46.768 --> 28:50.467
311 decibels-- everything Ritz
said could likely be true.

28:50.511 --> 28:52.252
Vance said the machine
was tested by the Navy

28:52.295 --> 28:54.123
and was running to spec.

28:54.167 --> 28:56.778
KASIE: The Navy thought it was,
but what they didn'’t know

28:56.822 --> 28:59.302
is that Treble encrypted
a software defeat program

28:59.346 --> 29:01.043
into their operating system.

29:01.087 --> 29:02.784
Do you remember the scandal
that Volkswagen had

29:02.828 --> 29:04.438
with their diesel engines?

29:04.481 --> 29:07.049
Yeah, they rigged the cars so
they could pass the smog test.

29:07.093 --> 29:09.573
Well, Treble did the same thing
with their sonar machines.

29:09.617 --> 29:12.054
But instead of smog,
the pollution is decibels.

29:12.098 --> 29:14.491
And the whales
paid the price.

29:20.323 --> 29:23.631
Hey.Hey.

29:23.674 --> 29:25.328
Who do we have here?

29:25.372 --> 29:28.244
Carrie Lewis, CEO of Treble.

29:28.288 --> 29:31.160
Huh. Head held high,

29:31.204 --> 29:33.597
shoulders back,
tailored pantsuit.

29:33.641 --> 29:36.818
Gibbs will have
his hands full with this one.

29:36.862 --> 29:38.124
You think?

29:38.167 --> 29:40.256
Trust me, it'’s gonna be a grind.

29:44.652 --> 29:47.611
Can you please tell me
what'’s going on?

29:47.655 --> 29:50.397
LFA sonar.

29:52.573 --> 29:54.401
We know what you did.

29:57.360 --> 30:00.929
Treble was in the red
for the last three quarters.

30:00.973 --> 30:04.715
We had to win the Navy'’s bid
or we'’d go under, so...

30:04.759 --> 30:06.848
:
I did a really terrible thing.

30:06.892 --> 30:08.850
Quite a grind.

30:08.894 --> 30:10.852
Pantsuit threw me off.

30:10.896 --> 30:13.376
Guess my job here'’s finished.

30:13.420 --> 30:18.120
We didn'’t think that fudging
the decibel output a little bit

30:18.164 --> 30:20.557
would actually harm
any ocean life.

30:20.601 --> 30:21.732
It did.

30:21.776 --> 30:23.560
Are you sure
it'’s our sonar machines

30:23.604 --> 30:24.735
that are killing those whales?

30:24.779 --> 30:26.476
I am.

30:26.520 --> 30:28.043
Wasn'’t just whales.

30:28.087 --> 30:29.958
Oh, God.

30:30.002 --> 30:32.569
I killed a bunch of baby seals,
didn'’t I?

30:32.613 --> 30:34.136
And a person.

30:37.705 --> 30:39.750
That artist, Ritz?

30:39.794 --> 30:42.405
No, that guy'’s just
posing as Ritz.

30:42.449 --> 30:46.627
But you thought he was the real
deal, and you had him killed.

30:46.670 --> 30:48.455
Why would I do that?

30:48.498 --> 30:52.154
You knew that Ritz was looking
into your company'’s sonar,

30:52.198 --> 30:54.591
and you were worried that
your secrets would be revealed.

30:54.635 --> 30:56.419
Which is why we hired
a private investigator

30:56.463 --> 30:59.422
to find out
who this Ritz person is.

31:02.469 --> 31:05.080
All roads led to Jared Clarke.

31:05.124 --> 31:07.691
So we told our P.I.
to keep an eye on him.

31:07.735 --> 31:11.260
Which is how we learned that
Clarke had his own problems.

31:11.304 --> 31:13.349
Someone else was following him,

31:13.393 --> 31:15.308
so we did
the right thing.

31:15.351 --> 31:18.224
We contacted Clarke
and gave him a heads up.

31:19.834 --> 31:22.532
Why would we try to help him
if we wanted him dead?

31:22.576 --> 31:25.971
How did you contact him?

31:26.014 --> 31:29.800
We sent a direct message to
Ritz'’s verified Twitter account.

31:29.844 --> 31:33.282
Except that Clarke
didn'’t control that account.

31:33.326 --> 31:35.110
So he never got the message.

31:35.154 --> 31:37.112
So, who did?

31:49.559 --> 31:53.955
Bishop, your pal Ritz...
she lied to us.

31:53.999 --> 31:55.957
We don'’t know that for sure.No, she knew

31:56.001 --> 31:57.654
Treble was trying
to help Clarke,

31:57.698 --> 31:59.178
not kill him.

31:59.221 --> 32:00.744
Where is she?She just left.

32:00.788 --> 32:03.051
I don'’t-- she can't be far.
Here, I'’ll call her.

32:04.531 --> 32:06.968
I'’m sure she can explain.

32:16.586 --> 32:18.371
Or not.

32:29.860 --> 32:31.688
McGEE:
Lying to federal officers,

32:31.732 --> 32:34.256
fleeing authorities,
property damage.

32:34.300 --> 32:35.605
Property damage?

32:35.649 --> 32:36.867
Yeah. Spraying graffiti.

32:36.911 --> 32:37.956
It'’s art.

32:37.999 --> 32:39.261
No, it'’s a felony.

32:39.305 --> 32:42.873
Since when
did you become 85 years old?

32:42.917 --> 32:45.006
Look, all I'’m saying is your
friend Ritz here is a criminal.

32:45.050 --> 32:47.617
And a murder target
who needs our help.

32:47.661 --> 32:50.229
Can'’t help her if we can't
find her. Where is she?

32:51.404 --> 32:53.101
I don'’t know.

32:53.145 --> 32:55.190
Well, wherever she is,

32:55.234 --> 32:57.192
she'’s a happy girl.

32:57.236 --> 32:58.280
She took down Treble.

32:58.324 --> 32:59.542
No, we took down Treble.

32:59.586 --> 33:01.544
BISHOP: Thanks to
her information.

33:01.588 --> 33:03.416
Meanwhile, a killer
is still on the loose.

33:03.459 --> 33:05.766
We found a killer.

33:05.809 --> 33:08.943
Of dolphins and whales,
and, in Ritz'’s mind,

33:08.987 --> 33:10.945
a thousand
marine animals'’ lives

33:10.989 --> 33:12.903
are just as important
as one person.

33:12.947 --> 33:14.601
No, more important.

33:14.644 --> 33:16.081
McGee is right.

33:17.430 --> 33:19.780
She bailed out without giving us
any real information.

33:19.823 --> 33:21.956
If Ritz had any information
about the killer,

33:22.000 --> 33:23.958
she would tell us.

33:24.002 --> 33:26.308
She wouldn'’t just
leave us in the lurch.

33:26.352 --> 33:27.788
McGEE:
But she did, Bishop.

33:27.831 --> 33:30.660
She took off without even
bothering to leave a note.

33:32.271 --> 33:37.015
Or maybe we just
haven'’t found it.

33:37.058 --> 33:39.582
TORRES:
Where'’s she going?

33:39.626 --> 33:41.671
Where'’s hegoing?

33:46.894 --> 33:48.635
This painting was
Ritz'’s idea.

33:48.678 --> 33:50.158
What if this wasn'’t
just a test?

33:50.202 --> 33:52.900
I mean, what if she used it
to leave us a message?

33:52.943 --> 33:54.249
QR code.

33:54.293 --> 33:58.079
TORRES: All right,
who wants to do the honors?

34:00.516 --> 34:03.998
Oh, Gibbs. Um...

34:04.042 --> 34:06.044
Yeah, so, like, um...

34:06.087 --> 34:08.481
Boss, QR codes
require an app.

34:08.524 --> 34:10.918
And, uh, well,
you'’re-you're just not equipped.

34:13.355 --> 34:15.183
I mean, your phone
is amazing.

34:15.227 --> 34:17.707
It'’s-it's practical
and it'’s very you.

34:17.751 --> 34:19.796
But, um...TORRES: But what
he'’s trying to say is

34:19.840 --> 34:22.147
that, uh, it belongs in a
museum next to this painting.

34:22.190 --> 34:24.845
Well, somebody take
the damn picture already.

34:24.888 --> 34:27.804
I got it, boss.
Here we go.

34:34.072 --> 34:36.596
Not equipped, McGee?

34:36.639 --> 34:38.119
No, I-I'’m equipped.

34:38.163 --> 34:39.990
Just doesn'’t seem
to be a code on here.

34:41.209 --> 34:43.690
Ritz uses a pre-made stamp

34:43.733 --> 34:45.431
to apply the QR codes.

34:45.474 --> 34:48.260
If she had it on her,
I didn'’t see it.

34:48.303 --> 34:50.131
There'’s got to be
something here.

34:50.175 --> 34:53.178
Something, like,
in the image itself.

34:53.221 --> 34:55.441
Well, art is subjective.

34:55.484 --> 34:59.053
All I see is your long locks
and Gibbs'’ inky black stare.

35:00.489 --> 35:03.057
That'’s it. Ink.

35:04.493 --> 35:06.713
I thought Ritz uses spray paint.

35:06.756 --> 35:11.196
Well, she does,
but she signs her paintings

35:11.239 --> 35:16.070
in black light pen,
which means you can only see it

35:16.114 --> 35:18.812
under ultraviolet light.

35:22.772 --> 35:24.731
Wait, wait, wait. What is that?

35:26.036 --> 35:27.386
That'’s no QR code.

35:27.429 --> 35:29.866
That is a license plate number.

35:31.607 --> 35:33.131
2-B-4-5.

35:34.262 --> 35:36.221
McGEE:
This can'’t be right.

35:36.264 --> 35:38.092
Why

35:38.136 --> 35:39.920
It'’s registered to
Brady Spencer.

35:39.963 --> 35:41.835
That'’s the legislator
who killed himself.

35:41.878 --> 35:44.142
GIBBS: Dead men
don'’t kill people, Torres.

35:44.185 --> 35:46.144
He must have sold it,
or his estate did.

35:46.187 --> 35:48.755
Or the new owner never updated
the registration.

35:48.798 --> 35:50.844
Pardon the interruption,
but this was

35:50.887 --> 35:52.150
too important to call.

35:52.193 --> 35:54.239
So, Kasie tested the ashes
that were stuffed

35:54.282 --> 35:57.155
in the victim'’s mouth; they
were not from the fireplace.

35:57.198 --> 35:59.940
They were from an urn.Human ashes?

35:59.983 --> 36:02.334
It'’s safe to say
this most certainly was

36:02.377 --> 36:04.162
a crime of passion.You get an I.D.?

36:04.205 --> 36:06.207
Uh, no.
The process of cremation

36:06.251 --> 36:07.948
destroys DNA,
but there is a way to

36:07.991 --> 36:09.602
radiocarbon date
human remains

36:09.645 --> 36:12.170
through tooth enamel,
even after pulverization.

36:12.213 --> 36:15.260
We asked Kasie to analyze
the few shavings

36:15.303 --> 36:17.000
that didn'’t burn entirely.

36:17.044 --> 36:20.134
She was able to extract
enough carbonate

36:20.178 --> 36:23.616
to approximate the year
the person was born.

36:23.659 --> 36:26.358
And it was 19...71?

36:26.401 --> 36:27.489
You really stole my thunder.

36:27.533 --> 36:29.361
The senator was born in 1971.

36:29.404 --> 36:30.797
Who is Spencer'’s
next of kin?

36:30.840 --> 36:34.192
Uh, unmarried, no kids;
he has a father who lives

36:34.235 --> 36:35.889
in a nursing home in Florida.GIBBS: What else?

36:35.932 --> 36:37.238
McGEE: Well, boss,
we already know about

36:37.282 --> 36:39.022
the scandal that
led to the suicide.

36:39.066 --> 36:41.155
Job meant everything to Spencer.

36:41.199 --> 36:43.244
Killed himself when he lost it.

36:43.288 --> 36:44.854
State senator has a staff.

36:46.508 --> 36:48.467
All who lost their jobs
because of Ritz.

36:48.510 --> 36:50.730
Wait, Torres. Look.

36:50.773 --> 36:54.299
McGEE: Let'’s see.
That is Luke Green.

36:54.342 --> 36:55.952
Senator'’s former
chief of staff.

36:55.996 --> 36:57.345
That'’s the guy
who was at the gallery.

36:57.389 --> 36:59.173
He knew everything
about Ritz and the QR codes.

36:59.217 --> 37:01.088
Bring him in. Find him.

37:01.131 --> 37:02.220
Just did.

37:06.224 --> 37:08.661
And our low price
of just $99.99 includes

37:08.704 --> 37:10.663
high-speed Internet access
and Wi-Fi.

37:10.706 --> 37:12.230
And you can bundle it
with the landline

37:12.273 --> 37:15.450
for just $6 more

37:15.494 --> 37:19.193
Wow. From a, uh, state
senator'’s chief of staff

37:19.237 --> 37:20.586
to a telemarketing gig.

37:20.629 --> 37:22.109
Well, talk about
a fall from grace.

37:22.152 --> 37:24.067
All right, split up, find him.

37:24.111 --> 37:25.417
Found him.

37:27.680 --> 37:29.247
Hey.

37:30.422 --> 37:32.250
Stop! Federal agents!

37:37.255 --> 37:38.343
TORRES:
Come on, dude.

37:38.386 --> 37:40.649
Come on, just... just drop it.

37:40.693 --> 37:41.694
Where'’s the fire, Luke?

37:41.737 --> 37:44.871
Senator Spencer was a good man.

37:44.914 --> 37:46.873
He was like a father to me.

37:46.916 --> 37:48.875
Ritz ruined his life and mine.

37:48.918 --> 37:50.529
Well, your beloved senator
was caught

37:50.572 --> 37:52.182
taking payoffs
from oil companies.

37:52.226 --> 37:54.881
It'’s politics;
sometimes you get dirty.

37:54.924 --> 37:57.057
And sometimes
you, uh, get caught.

37:57.100 --> 37:58.580
Ritz got what he deserved.

37:58.624 --> 37:59.712
No, she didn'’t.

37:59.755 --> 38:01.235
No, you didn'’t kill
the real Ritz.

38:01.279 --> 38:02.541
You killed an imposter.

38:02.584 --> 38:05.239
What?

38:05.283 --> 38:07.372
Then who'’s the real Ritz?

38:07.415 --> 38:10.636
Better question is:
where'’s the real Ritz?

38:21.386 --> 38:23.562
MELANIE:
Can'’t ever have too many.

38:27.261 --> 38:29.089
Thulian.

38:29.132 --> 38:30.308
Which is?

38:30.351 --> 38:32.222
Ugly-ass pink.

38:33.572 --> 38:35.400
Nice choice.

38:36.705 --> 38:38.228
Nice play.

38:38.272 --> 38:40.753
You guys were working
a murder case.

38:40.796 --> 38:43.408
I had to make you think
Treble was behind the hit.

38:43.451 --> 38:45.758
And you wanted us
to investigate

38:45.801 --> 38:48.717
so we'’d figure out
why their sonar

38:48.761 --> 38:50.240
was harming sea life.

38:50.284 --> 38:51.459
And you did.

38:51.503 --> 38:53.766
Our job was to find a killer.

38:53.809 --> 38:55.594
And you did.

38:57.422 --> 39:00.512
I think it needs another layer
of ugly-ass pink.

39:00.555 --> 39:02.470
Feathers are always
a little tricky.

39:05.952 --> 39:09.912
So... how'’d you know
the license plate number

39:09.956 --> 39:11.784
of the killer'’s car?

39:11.827 --> 39:13.394
When I sent those
threatening messages

39:13.438 --> 39:14.700
to Clarke, he responded.

39:14.743 --> 39:17.006
Said he saw me
in my car

39:17.050 --> 39:18.791
following him; sent me
the license plate number

39:18.834 --> 39:20.053
to prove it.

39:20.096 --> 39:22.534
And instead of giving us
the number,

39:22.577 --> 39:24.884
you took off
because all you care about

39:24.927 --> 39:26.233
is saving the whales.

39:26.276 --> 39:28.191
Don'’t forget the seals
and the dolphins.

39:28.235 --> 39:30.455
I'’m sorry I lied to you,
but, look,

39:30.498 --> 39:32.848
I mean, we did
a good thing here.

39:32.892 --> 39:35.111
You should be proud.I am.

39:35.155 --> 39:36.765
So, are we good?

39:36.809 --> 39:40.029
Good enough.

39:42.597 --> 39:45.252
It'’s kind of cool to be
one of the few people

39:45.295 --> 39:49.648
who know the real identity
of the infamous Ritz.

39:49.691 --> 39:53.042
It'’s rad. I dig it.

39:53.086 --> 39:56.394
Good. Because I
want you to have it.

40:06.534 --> 40:08.841
Well, I have
just the spot for it.

40:10.886 --> 40:12.279
Thanks, Bish.

40:12.322 --> 40:14.542
Take care, Ritz.

40:34.736 --> 40:36.477
It'’s open.

40:38.827 --> 40:40.263
You ready?

40:41.177 --> 40:42.701
Goat yoga.

40:42.744 --> 40:44.703
You'’re actually going back?

40:44.746 --> 40:46.313
Your boy Torres
doesn'’t take an "L"

40:46.356 --> 40:47.619
without getting off
the mat, baby.

40:47.662 --> 40:48.750
What about Jessica?

40:48.794 --> 40:50.404
I'’m looking at Jessica
in the eyes,

40:50.448 --> 40:52.014
and if she gets
rambunctious again,

40:52.058 --> 40:53.494
there will be hell to pay.

40:53.538 --> 40:54.539
I don'’t think
that'’s gonna work.

40:54.582 --> 40:55.540
Yeah, me neither.

40:55.583 --> 40:56.715
That'’s why I brought the helmet

40:56.758 --> 40:58.064
and the Teflon vest;
it'’s in my car.

40:58.107 --> 41:00.066
Okay. I'’ll get my bag.

41:04.113 --> 41:05.898
Um...
What'’s up?

41:05.941 --> 41:10.424
Just got a news alert
about Ritz.

41:10.468 --> 41:12.992
In Australia?That'’s impossible.

41:13.035 --> 41:14.863
Ritz couldn'’t have
tagged a piece

41:14.907 --> 41:18.214
in Sydney last night;
she was with us.

41:18.258 --> 41:21.914
Wasn'’t she?
