WEBVTT

00:01.566 --> 00:03.394
Aah!

00:03.394 --> 00:06.441
This season hasn'’t even started,
and it'’s already a sh---show.

00:06.441 --> 00:10.053
I got my chief and my second
stew stuck in immigration.

00:10.053 --> 00:11.141
In order to save
the charter season,

00:11.141 --> 00:12.316
I'’m starting with some temps.

00:12.316 --> 00:13.578
It'’s a large vessel.

00:13.578 --> 00:16.059
Having four on
the interior is a must.

00:16.059 --> 00:18.105
- But for now, three.
- Yeah.

00:18.105 --> 00:19.454
I need you to take command.

00:19.454 --> 00:20.281
Easy.

00:20.281 --> 00:21.586
When the chief stew comes,

00:21.586 --> 00:23.414
you don'’t have a
problem stepping down?

00:23.414 --> 00:25.025
No, I'’m happy.
I'’m flexible.

00:25.025 --> 00:26.287
Thank you.

00:26.287 --> 00:27.984
It'’s hard coming onto a
yacht knowing

00:27.984 --> 00:29.681
I'’m just filling in a
temp chief'’s stew position.

00:29.681 --> 00:30.987
Personally, I think I'’m going
to do a better job

00:30.987 --> 00:32.858
than anyone that comes in.

00:32.858 --> 00:34.643
Wow.
Beautiful.

00:34.643 --> 00:36.688
I like that you have
this 200-ton yachtmaster.

00:36.688 --> 00:38.125
That'’s good.

00:38.125 --> 00:39.996
I'’ve been bosun for
about three years now.

00:39.996 --> 00:41.171
I ran away from home
super young,

00:41.171 --> 00:42.477
dropped out of school 16,

00:42.477 --> 00:44.348
got myself to where
I am the hard way.

00:44.348 --> 00:46.307
So you'’re only temp helping us,

00:46.307 --> 00:47.656
and then she'’s leaving.

00:47.656 --> 00:48.961
At the moment,
you'’re second stew.

00:48.961 --> 00:50.267
What does that do?

00:50.267 --> 00:52.791
It'’s supposed to
release the wrinkles.

00:52.791 --> 00:55.142
I'’m not a teacher.
I'’m a follower.

00:55.142 --> 00:56.273
I'’ve met someone now.

00:56.273 --> 00:57.883
He wants an open relationship.

00:57.883 --> 00:59.537
Open is dating others?

00:59.537 --> 01:02.105
If you meet another Storm here,
what will you do?

01:02.105 --> 01:03.715
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.

01:03.715 --> 01:04.847
I'’m Luka.

01:04.847 --> 01:06.544
It'’s like the eyes, the smile.

01:06.544 --> 01:09.286
He'’s like a surfer scooter
boy mixed with God.

01:09.286 --> 01:12.028
Kian Karimi, my personal
friend and doctor.

01:12.028 --> 01:13.334
It'’s an all-boys trip.

01:13.334 --> 01:14.857
The couple days we'’ve
been in Italy,

01:14.857 --> 01:17.338
we'’ve had about 20
collective Michelin stars.

01:17.338 --> 01:19.818
I'’m Harry Potter, and
the galley is my Hogwarts.

01:19.818 --> 01:20.993
It was great.

01:20.993 --> 01:22.995
This is not your
average lamb chop.

01:22.995 --> 01:25.172
I feel like I'’ve never even
actually used the chamois.

01:25.172 --> 01:26.477
Is this your first
time on a yacht?

01:26.477 --> 01:27.783
Yeah.

01:27.783 --> 01:29.611
These are all photocopies
of certified copy.

01:29.611 --> 01:31.482
I can try and
get them sent, yeah?

01:31.482 --> 01:33.658
The officer just
had me scan this.

01:37.575 --> 01:39.795
Who is that guy?

01:39.795 --> 01:43.538
- Did you go to a school?
- Pardon? Yeah, yeah.

01:43.538 --> 01:44.887
- You have to be honest with me.
- No, no, I am.

01:44.887 --> 01:46.236
Big red flag.

01:46.236 --> 01:47.629
I can'’t leave the dock
with you on board.

01:47.629 --> 01:49.587
Get your documents.
Let'’s verify this.

01:49.587 --> 01:51.372
Then a tender will
bring you to the boat.

01:51.372 --> 01:53.374
I'’m in a horrible situation.

01:53.374 --> 01:55.027
Hey, Ru.
How are you doing?

01:55.027 --> 01:57.639
<i>I'’m kind of just deciding
to call it quits.</i>

01:57.639 --> 01:59.902
Having to start the first
charter without a chief stew

01:59.902 --> 02:02.252
and now a bosun.

02:02.252 --> 02:04.559
So it'’s us three going
to leave the dock.

02:04.559 --> 02:05.647
Adios, amigo.

02:05.647 --> 02:07.562
So what I need
is an interim bosun.

02:07.562 --> 02:08.867
Whoa.

02:08.867 --> 02:10.391
What?

02:10.391 --> 02:11.827
Yeah, sure I don'’t mind
stepping up and helping out.

02:11.827 --> 02:14.177
This will be my first
time being bosun.

02:14.177 --> 02:17.093
Fingers crossed, someone comes
in and we get another bosun.

02:21.793 --> 02:23.230
Hi, Norma.

02:23.230 --> 02:24.535
You'’re kidding me.

02:24.535 --> 02:26.450
You can'’t get anyone
for two weeks?

02:27.625 --> 02:29.758
Now, what do I do?

02:29.758 --> 02:32.195
Unbelievable.

02:40.508 --> 02:42.249
Okay. All right. Ciao.

02:42.249 --> 02:46.209
Oh, unbelievable.

02:46.209 --> 02:48.429
ing crazy.

02:48.429 --> 02:49.734
This has never happened to me.

02:49.734 --> 02:51.475
I guess I'’ll figure
something out.

02:55.653 --> 02:57.481
- I just set the table.
- I'’ll do a fruit platter.

02:57.481 --> 03:00.267
I'’ll do some berries, cheese.

03:00.267 --> 03:02.225
- Good morning.
- How are you?

03:02.225 --> 03:03.618
I'’m good.
How are you?

03:03.618 --> 03:05.010
Fat, ugly, tired.

03:05.010 --> 03:07.143
Good.

03:07.143 --> 03:08.710
Would anyone like
an omelet

03:08.710 --> 03:10.973
or would they like eggs
in a specific way?

03:10.973 --> 03:12.235
We can do anything.

03:12.235 --> 03:13.323
- I want an over medium.
- Over medium.

03:13.323 --> 03:15.847
- Over easy.
- Over easy.

03:17.327 --> 03:19.460
Copy that.
First one'’s coming down.

03:19.460 --> 03:21.331
- Woo.
- Damn windy.

03:21.331 --> 03:23.420
- Hello.
- Give me the damage.

03:23.420 --> 03:25.422
Two over medium
and two over easy.

03:25.422 --> 03:27.685
Okay.
I think I know what that is.

03:33.735 --> 03:36.128
<i>You'’ll see the jetski
coming around in two seconds.</i>

03:36.128 --> 03:37.826
There you go.
The big toy.

03:37.826 --> 03:39.480
Yep.

03:39.480 --> 03:41.133
Whoa.

03:41.133 --> 03:42.439
Swell.

03:42.439 --> 03:43.527
We need to have
a South Easterly.

03:43.527 --> 03:44.833
There'’s no protection.

03:44.833 --> 03:46.878
It'’s a lot choppier
than last night.

03:46.878 --> 03:47.923
I feel like I might throw up.

03:47.923 --> 03:49.881
There'’s two over mediums.

03:49.881 --> 03:51.361
Just be careful of that line.

03:51.361 --> 03:53.320
This place is chaos.

03:53.320 --> 03:55.147
I don'’t think this
is Jetski weather.

03:55.147 --> 03:56.192
Put it back up.

03:56.192 --> 03:58.977
- Well, practice.
- Yeah.

03:58.977 --> 04:02.242
It'’s very dangerous because
the wind is gushing.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.852
I'’m going to go back up.
You happy?

04:03.852 --> 04:04.853
Yeah.

04:09.249 --> 04:11.860
He'’s just,
everything is just okay.

04:11.860 --> 04:15.646
He'’s beautiful and he has the
greatest qualities about him.

04:15.646 --> 04:17.779
Like, he'’s God's gift.

04:18.910 --> 04:21.348
Oh, it'’s sh--.

04:21.348 --> 04:24.002
<i>Captain Sandy.
Captain Sandy. Luka.</i>

04:24.002 --> 04:25.700
So this is the over medium.

04:25.700 --> 04:28.006
Yeah. That'’s okay.
It'’s not over medium.

04:28.006 --> 04:29.356
- Is yours over medium?
- That'’s not.

04:29.356 --> 04:30.661
What happened to the jetski?

04:30.661 --> 04:32.272
- They'’re bringing it back up.
- No.

04:34.752 --> 04:36.754
Now they'’re putting them
back up, right?

04:36.754 --> 04:38.408
Yeah. It'’s a little choppy.
You can see that.

04:38.408 --> 04:40.018
Give that one just on the table.

04:40.018 --> 04:41.498
Okay.

04:41.498 --> 04:42.586
And then I'’ll actually
walk that one around.

04:42.586 --> 04:44.196
- Okay.
- this thing.

04:44.196 --> 04:46.851
All right, who wants some bacon?

04:46.851 --> 04:49.376
We will not have an
adventurous day today.

04:51.378 --> 04:53.771
<i>Captain Sandy.
Captain Sandy. Luka.</i>

04:53.771 --> 04:55.512
- Go ahead.
<i>- What'’s your location?</i>

04:55.512 --> 04:57.340
On the bridge by
the time you get there.

04:57.340 --> 04:59.386
Perfect.
I'’ll see you soon.

04:59.386 --> 05:00.517
Would you like me
to clear this one?

05:00.517 --> 05:01.518
- Yes, please.
- Sure.

05:01.518 --> 05:02.824
Is that okay, everyone?

05:02.824 --> 05:05.087
Well, we now know
that Jack is mortal.

05:05.087 --> 05:06.349
Yeah.

05:06.349 --> 05:07.568
Oh, [bleep].

05:07.568 --> 05:08.960
- We found his weakness.
- Eggs?

05:08.960 --> 05:10.745
Eggs are his weakness for sure.

05:10.745 --> 05:12.355
He'’s a talented chef, but he
can'’t cook eggs worth a crap.

05:12.355 --> 05:14.183
Would you like the yolks
to be more runny?

05:14.183 --> 05:15.358
- Yeah.
- That was overhard.

05:15.358 --> 05:16.577
In case you have any
more Americans,

05:16.577 --> 05:18.274
maybe just, you know...

05:18.274 --> 05:20.232
- Know that one.
- Have a guide.

05:20.232 --> 05:21.451
Maybe just a picture guide.

05:21.451 --> 05:22.800
Easy-peasy.

05:22.800 --> 05:25.586
Hello.
We tracked one in. Had problems.

05:25.586 --> 05:27.588
- It'’s a bit too rough.
- Yeah.

05:27.588 --> 05:29.503
I agree.
This will pass.

05:29.503 --> 05:31.766
So just have what we
got at the moment.

05:31.766 --> 05:33.333
Yeah.
Maybe they'’ll go ashore.

05:33.333 --> 05:34.943
We could use the tender
on the port side.

05:34.943 --> 05:36.336
Yeah.

05:39.426 --> 05:40.557
What'’s up, buddy?

05:40.557 --> 05:41.602
Welcome to day two.

05:41.602 --> 05:43.604
How you feeling, big guy?

05:48.652 --> 05:49.566
No.

05:52.177 --> 05:54.397
Oh, my God.

05:54.397 --> 05:56.399
Let it all out.
Do you feel better?

06:02.013 --> 06:03.319
- So...
- So?

06:03.319 --> 06:04.625
I think the eggs...

06:04.625 --> 06:06.322
Some people wanted them
a little bit more runny.

06:06.322 --> 06:07.454
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

06:07.454 --> 06:08.977
All they said, no,
they were fine.

06:08.977 --> 06:11.022
- They were like...
- I knew when I was cooking '’em.

06:11.022 --> 06:12.415
I----ing hate eggs.

06:12.415 --> 06:13.677
I'’ll be honest,
I don'’t eat breakfast.

06:21.946 --> 06:23.600
So, I can do all the
fancy things in the world,

06:23.600 --> 06:25.515
but when it comes to egg things,
my head just falls off.

06:25.515 --> 06:27.125
They'’re good eggs, Jack.

06:27.125 --> 06:29.998
The Americans just invent
different egg styles every day.

06:31.216 --> 06:33.044
Can you rinse my asshole?

06:35.699 --> 06:36.657
Thank you, brother.

06:36.657 --> 06:38.006
Let me check in with Sandy.

06:39.703 --> 06:42.314
Okay. So, we can just
free these plates up.

06:42.314 --> 06:43.403
Bread, too?
Just throw that down?

06:43.403 --> 06:44.795
- Yeah.
- I'’m learning.

06:44.795 --> 06:46.101
It'’s soaking in everything.

06:46.101 --> 06:47.407
You'’re doing good.
Don'’t worry.

06:47.407 --> 06:48.843
Knock, knock.
May I enter?

06:48.843 --> 06:49.887
Of course.

06:49.887 --> 06:51.193
A couple of the
guys are pretty...

06:51.193 --> 06:53.717
- Are they really?
- Yeah.

06:53.717 --> 06:55.415
- Tossing their cookies.
- Yeah.

06:55.415 --> 06:56.981
So, if you think it'’s going
to be like this for a while,

06:56.981 --> 06:58.461
maybe we'’ll go to shore
for a little bit.

06:58.461 --> 07:00.158
It will be.
Let'’s get you ashore.

07:00.158 --> 07:02.683
You know, having my friends
on board, I feel bad.

07:02.683 --> 07:04.424
We'’re down team members.

07:04.424 --> 07:06.208
We need to find a
way to give these guys

07:06.208 --> 07:07.514
everything that they paid for.

07:07.514 --> 07:09.516
Because if this
charter doesn'’t go well,

07:09.516 --> 07:11.387
I'’m going to have
to find a new doctor.

07:11.387 --> 07:12.823
They'’re going to feel better.

07:12.823 --> 07:14.564
We can'’t do anything
anyway with this...

07:14.564 --> 07:16.436
All right. I'’ll get
the tender around for you.

07:16.436 --> 07:17.785
Thank you, Sandy.

07:17.785 --> 07:19.439
- Hey, doll.
- Oh, it'’s good to see you.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.223
- How are you?
- I'’m good.

07:21.223 --> 07:22.398
- Are you wet?
- Yeah.

07:22.398 --> 07:24.008
Oh, fresh me up.

07:24.008 --> 07:24.966
Oh, cold shower.

07:24.966 --> 07:27.359
Okay, gropey.
I'’m kidding.

07:27.359 --> 07:28.622
Oh.

07:28.622 --> 07:30.275
- Cop a feel, would you?
- Get out of here.

07:30.275 --> 07:31.886
Kidding.

07:31.886 --> 07:33.540
Me and my boyfriend have been
together for four months.

07:33.540 --> 07:36.238
He wants his open relationship
that I'’m so unsure about.

07:36.238 --> 07:38.196
Like, every guy I'’ve been
with has cheated.

07:38.196 --> 07:39.894
So, like, I'’d rather be
an honest relationship

07:39.894 --> 07:41.025
from the start.

07:41.025 --> 07:43.245
Unfortunately,
I felt the love for him

07:43.245 --> 07:45.421
before I knew that this
is the style he wanted.

07:45.421 --> 07:46.857
So, it wasn'’t like
I knew about it.

07:46.857 --> 07:48.685
And I was like,
oh, that'’s not my type.

07:48.685 --> 07:50.687
Like, I already loved
him before he mentioned

07:50.687 --> 07:52.297
wanting this style
of relationship.

07:52.297 --> 07:54.082
I'’m half okay with it,

07:54.082 --> 07:56.171
and I'’m half working on
trying to be okay with it.

07:56.171 --> 07:58.695
So, with Luka, there'’s no
problem having to flirt.

07:58.695 --> 08:02.090
Looking is fine.
Touching is a no-go.

08:02.090 --> 08:03.918
Well, it is, I think, '’cause
I'’m in an open relationship.

08:03.918 --> 08:05.963
So, does that mean,
like, do I get approval?

08:05.963 --> 08:07.574
Like, do I go up to
the bridge and ask?

08:07.574 --> 08:08.966
Do I, like, what do I do?

08:08.966 --> 08:10.751
Get out of here.

08:10.751 --> 08:12.753
I wonder who this new
chief stew is coming in.

08:12.753 --> 08:15.495
- Luka to the bridge.
- Copy that, I'’m on my way.

08:17.105 --> 08:18.933
So, they'’re sick.
They want to go ashore.

08:18.933 --> 08:21.283
- They'’re sick?
- You'’re gonna have to move.

08:21.283 --> 08:24.112
<i>Lara, Lara, Luka, could you
come to the swim platform?</i>

08:24.112 --> 08:25.940
<i>We'’re gonna take
the guests ashore.</i>

08:25.940 --> 08:27.115
Copy that.

08:27.115 --> 08:28.246
So, you guys can leave.

08:28.246 --> 08:29.857
We'’ll have the tender
on stand by.

08:29.857 --> 08:32.773
- The tender?
- The tender'’s the small boat.

08:32.773 --> 08:35.253
- Oh, okay. Sorry.
- No worries.

08:35.253 --> 08:38.300
The tender in America
is a chicken, isn'’t it?

08:38.300 --> 08:39.519
- Chicken tender.
- Chicken tender.

08:39.519 --> 08:41.956
That'’s funny.

08:41.956 --> 08:42.913
Choppy.

08:42.913 --> 08:44.088
- Oh, it'’s rough.
- All right.

08:50.921 --> 08:52.227
Overboard.

08:54.055 --> 08:56.274
It'’s probably your best bet.

08:56.274 --> 08:58.233
It'’s a tender.
It'’s not an airplane.

08:58.233 --> 09:00.061
You'’re not gonna get a
little bag to throw up in.

09:00.061 --> 09:01.758
You just gotta chuck
it in the sea.

09:01.758 --> 09:03.847
The sickie'’s in the
periphery, please.

09:03.847 --> 09:05.327
The sickie'’s on the back.

09:05.327 --> 09:06.981
One foot there, bro.

09:06.981 --> 09:08.504
Here goes.
It'’s a good time.

09:08.504 --> 09:10.462
It'’s a very good time now.

09:10.462 --> 09:11.638
Yay!

09:11.638 --> 09:14.031
- Yeah, buddy.
- Stabilized.

09:14.031 --> 09:15.642
Yes, we are.

09:15.642 --> 09:17.948
- I don'’t like it.
- Gotta decide.

09:17.948 --> 09:20.690
You'’ll feel better ashore.

09:20.690 --> 09:22.605
Spilling chunks.

09:22.605 --> 09:23.998
- Uh-oh.
- Really?

09:23.998 --> 09:27.175
- Hug me.
- Oh, you got this.

09:27.175 --> 09:29.307
Don'’t you never let go.

09:29.307 --> 09:31.179
The only unfortunate
thing is the tender

09:31.179 --> 09:33.094
moves a lot more
than the big boat.

09:33.094 --> 09:35.662
They'’ve got about 10 minutes
of absolute torture

09:35.662 --> 09:38.795
before they get ashore.

09:38.795 --> 09:39.840
We'’re gonna be all right.

09:39.840 --> 09:41.015
You sure this is a good idea?

09:41.015 --> 09:45.410
Ah!
There'’s so much water!

09:45.410 --> 09:46.760
Coming up...

09:55.725 --> 09:57.727
Nathan is just not feeling good.

09:57.727 --> 09:59.381
- Nice.
- You'’ll feel better ashore.

09:59.381 --> 10:01.644
Gonna get a little worse
before it gets better, boys.

10:01.644 --> 10:04.212
He'’s just cranking, man.

10:04.212 --> 10:05.343
Let'’s do it.

10:09.043 --> 10:11.001
All right, guys.
Have fun.

10:11.001 --> 10:12.481
- Thank you, guys.
- Beautiful.

10:12.481 --> 10:14.657
Amazing vibe.

10:14.657 --> 10:15.919
Portofino,
it'’s----ing beautiful.

10:15.919 --> 10:18.443
Million-dollar boats everywhere.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.273
Portofino means the home
of the dolphins,

10:22.273 --> 10:24.449
so if they'’re lucky, they may
see some dolphins in there.

10:24.449 --> 10:26.800
Hopefully, they don'’t
puke on it.

10:26.800 --> 10:28.671
Get our sea legs back.

10:28.671 --> 10:30.760
- Good morning, Angel.
- Good morning.

10:30.760 --> 10:32.544
So, if you guys focus
on smashing

10:32.544 --> 10:33.981
out housekeeping together,

10:33.981 --> 10:35.373
do the bed together so you
can both pull aside,

10:35.373 --> 10:36.679
you know what it'’s like,

10:36.679 --> 10:37.767
and then bathroom
next, next, next.

10:37.767 --> 10:40.988
- Yeah.
- For sure.

10:40.988 --> 10:43.730
I smell like dick.
I definitely smell like dick.

10:45.688 --> 10:46.776
- I'’m stressed.
- I can'’t.

10:46.776 --> 10:48.082
I'’m stressed.

10:48.082 --> 10:49.518
It'’s definitely gonna
be difficult

10:49.518 --> 10:51.607
stepping down from, like,
a chief stew role

10:51.607 --> 10:53.348
when the new person arrives,

10:53.348 --> 10:54.479
but this first charter,

10:54.479 --> 10:56.351
I'’m sh--ting myself
a little bit.

10:56.351 --> 10:59.180
We are crew members down.
Brooke'’s never worked on a boat.

10:59.180 --> 11:01.530
I also want to impress
Jack, so...

11:01.530 --> 11:03.967
This is a great opportunity
for me to show Captain Sandy

11:03.967 --> 11:05.969
that I can just be an
amazing chief stew.

11:05.969 --> 11:08.406
The guests are off right now.
Why don'’t you go chill?

11:10.887 --> 11:13.411
They want, like,
a Michelin star dinner?

11:18.765 --> 11:20.375
- I know, I know.
- It'’s gonna be a late one.

11:20.375 --> 11:21.506
One more.

11:21.506 --> 11:23.204
Pump it out.

11:26.076 --> 11:28.426
- You good?
- Yeah.

11:28.426 --> 11:29.819
This is Portofino.

11:29.819 --> 11:30.994
Look at the views, amazing.

11:32.735 --> 11:33.823
What do you think?

11:33.823 --> 11:34.824
- Like it?
- It fits you. Yeah.

11:34.824 --> 11:36.217
I'’m gonna get it.

11:36.217 --> 11:37.697
- You feeling better?
- Yeah.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.263
So you'’re gonna go up
around the whole town?

11:39.263 --> 11:40.612
That'’s it, right?
That'’s the yacht?

11:40.612 --> 11:41.918
That'’s it.

11:41.918 --> 11:43.877
- I'’m here to help!
- Whoa!

11:43.877 --> 11:45.574
- Hello!
- Look who it is!

11:45.574 --> 11:46.923
Good morning!

11:50.535 --> 11:52.015
Ow, mother----er.

11:52.015 --> 11:54.191
- You okay?
- I just hit my funny bone.

11:54.191 --> 11:56.019
It wasn'’t that funny.

11:59.806 --> 12:00.807
Okay, that'’s good.

12:00.807 --> 12:02.243
The wind has died down.

12:02.243 --> 12:05.507
Girls, girls, how are you
going in housekeeping?

12:05.507 --> 12:07.422
We'’re in the master
right now, finishing up.

12:07.422 --> 12:08.945
Jess, you can take over.

12:08.945 --> 12:12.079
Brooke, go to the laundry
to swap machines

12:12.079 --> 12:14.255
and then go on
break for two hours, please.

12:14.255 --> 12:15.386
Copy.

12:17.911 --> 12:21.349
Coming up slowly and rotating.

12:23.177 --> 12:26.397
Kinda looks like a hot dog.

12:26.397 --> 12:28.095
Nice. Coming up.

12:28.095 --> 12:30.445
If she blows that up,
I can go pick up the guests.

12:30.445 --> 12:32.099
Okay, good idea.

12:34.449 --> 12:37.060
We can walk through.
the church.

12:37.060 --> 12:38.975
Like a free open museum.

12:38.975 --> 12:40.281
It'’s beautiful.

12:40.281 --> 12:41.673
- Amazing.
- Pretty cool, huh?

12:41.673 --> 12:44.459
Very nice.

12:44.459 --> 12:45.939
You sure you don'’t
want to go on break?

12:45.939 --> 12:48.071
No. I like to get ahead
of everything.

12:48.071 --> 12:49.638
My OCD.
Undiagnosed, but yes.

12:49.638 --> 12:51.118
Undiagnosed.

12:51.118 --> 12:52.467
We don'’t know how many
days and then you and me

12:52.467 --> 12:54.164
are not chief and second.

12:54.164 --> 12:56.079
And then we'’ll be together
in our little housekeeping

12:56.079 --> 12:58.081
Hobbit hole somewhere.

12:59.866 --> 13:00.954
Yeah.

13:00.954 --> 13:01.955
I think Natalya
is stressed that

13:01.955 --> 13:03.783
the new chief stew is coming.

13:03.783 --> 13:04.958
Maybe it'’s for the best.

13:04.958 --> 13:06.568
Did you leave Brooke a list?

13:06.568 --> 13:08.352
She'’s going to get very
overwhelmed with it.

13:08.352 --> 13:10.311
I think you'’re going
too easy on her.

13:10.311 --> 13:14.228
I'’m hoping the new chief stew
has a better way to delegate,

13:14.228 --> 13:17.231
so we'’re all
equally doing work.

13:17.231 --> 13:18.841
Oh, they'’ve all
got a spoon each.

13:18.841 --> 13:21.583
It'’s my favorite toy.

13:21.583 --> 13:22.845
The trampoline in here.

13:22.845 --> 13:24.368
I'’m pretty sure.

13:26.370 --> 13:27.502
Perfect.

13:27.502 --> 13:28.895
I just tied off over here.

13:29.896 --> 13:30.984
- Yeah.
- How was land?

13:30.984 --> 13:32.986
- Beautiful.
- It felt better.

13:32.986 --> 13:34.639
We can have it aired up
by the time they get here.

13:34.639 --> 13:35.597
It'’ll be awesome.

13:37.729 --> 13:41.516
<i>All crew, all crew.
Our tender'’s on its way back.</i>

13:41.516 --> 13:43.170
Here we go.

13:43.170 --> 13:45.302
- Hello, hello.
- All right.

13:45.302 --> 13:46.956
- Thank you, captain.
- Oh, yeah, you'’re welcome.

13:46.956 --> 13:48.566
- Better, right?
- It'’s beautiful.

13:48.566 --> 13:49.567
How was it?

13:49.567 --> 13:50.917
- Good.
- Awesome.

13:50.917 --> 13:52.309
Jump in the water,
you'’ll feel better.

13:52.309 --> 13:54.311
What kind of a Greek
goddess drink is this?

13:54.311 --> 13:56.879
Hibiscus iced tea
with sparkling water.

13:56.879 --> 13:58.185
Nice.

13:58.185 --> 14:00.056
All right, you know the drill.

14:00.056 --> 14:01.536
We'’ll just spin this around?

14:01.536 --> 14:03.886
- This davit is incredible.
- It'’s amazing.

14:03.886 --> 14:05.366
It'’s so easy to use as well.

14:05.366 --> 14:08.369
We'’ll just feed this
out as I spin this.

14:08.369 --> 14:09.892
Good job.

14:09.892 --> 14:11.459
- Oh, thank you.
- Grazie mille.

14:11.459 --> 14:12.634
Good job.

14:12.634 --> 14:14.288
Okay. The water toys.

14:14.288 --> 14:15.724
All right, guys, ready
for some water activities?

14:15.724 --> 14:18.379
You guys going to jump on this?

14:18.379 --> 14:19.554
Wait.

14:23.384 --> 14:24.385
That was a lot.

14:24.385 --> 14:25.603
Oh, good.
Throw on the banana.

14:25.603 --> 14:28.215
Let it rip, bro.

14:28.215 --> 14:29.390
Woo!

14:29.390 --> 14:31.479
- That is bananas.
- No guts, no glory.

14:31.479 --> 14:32.697
Woo!

14:34.395 --> 14:36.658
Whoa!

14:36.658 --> 14:37.702
These are fun.

14:37.702 --> 14:38.921
- Jack?
- Yeah.

14:38.921 --> 14:40.923
- Are you down in the crew area?
- Yeah.

14:40.923 --> 14:43.883
That is such a great
toy for everybody.

14:43.883 --> 14:45.841
This day turned out spectacular.

14:45.841 --> 14:48.365
I'’m really impressed with the
way the deck team are working,

14:48.365 --> 14:50.063
how quickly they'’re
getting the toys out.

14:50.063 --> 14:51.368
It'’s a lot of work.

14:51.368 --> 14:52.935
Within 15 minutes,
the slide is set.

14:52.935 --> 14:54.371
Like, who does that?

14:54.371 --> 14:56.591
But more importantly,
the client'’s having fun,

14:56.591 --> 14:58.245
so I'’m impressed.

14:58.245 --> 15:00.464
Woo!

15:00.464 --> 15:02.162
I'’ve got the girl's
pulling stuff.

15:02.162 --> 15:03.685
I just want to
know your meals courses.

15:03.685 --> 15:05.948
Well, they'’re going to
be appetizers, right?

15:05.948 --> 15:07.254
The first course is going
to be a risotto.

15:07.254 --> 15:09.038
Okay.
But the next course?

15:09.038 --> 15:10.561
The little salmon starter.

15:10.561 --> 15:12.694
- Okay.
- After that'’s a venison dish.

15:12.694 --> 15:13.782
What the hell'’s venison?

15:13.782 --> 15:16.045
- Yeah, Bambi.
- Aw!

15:16.045 --> 15:17.481
By the time I was 19,
I was basically running

15:17.481 --> 15:18.874
a Michelin Star kitchen,

15:18.874 --> 15:20.963
and I wasn'’t emotionally
ready for that position.

15:20.963 --> 15:22.965
I took a big sabbatical
and went to Asia

15:22.965 --> 15:24.575
and just changed
my whole mindset.

15:24.575 --> 15:26.838
I was teaching the locals
how to cook western food

15:26.838 --> 15:28.231
and vice versa.

15:28.231 --> 15:29.929
For the last meal
of the charter,

15:29.929 --> 15:31.887
there'’s a lot of Italian
influence, Asian influence,

15:31.887 --> 15:33.845
in there inspired from
the Michelin Star restaurants

15:33.845 --> 15:35.238
I reckon as well,

15:35.238 --> 15:36.805
so it'’s kind of like
a biography on a plate,

15:36.805 --> 15:38.415
because you can see my
journey throughout the courses

15:38.415 --> 15:40.940
without sounding too cheesy,
but yeah.

15:40.940 --> 15:42.506
After that is sea bass dish.

15:42.506 --> 15:44.421
ing hell.

15:47.207 --> 15:49.383
- Woo!
- Awesome, huh?

15:50.993 --> 15:52.125
You want to take another spin?

15:52.125 --> 15:53.126
Yeah, we'’ll do one more spin.

15:53.126 --> 15:54.997
Look around.

15:54.997 --> 15:56.781
Beautiful, isn'’t it? Woo!

16:11.535 --> 16:13.755
That looks like
a slide now.

16:13.755 --> 16:16.845
Haleigh, Haleigh, please come
to the swim platform.

16:16.845 --> 16:18.064
I need your help.

16:21.067 --> 16:22.416
It'’s a cluster----.

16:22.416 --> 16:24.331
There'’s lines everywhere
and sh-- everywhere.

16:24.331 --> 16:25.854
I am quite a perfectionist.

16:25.854 --> 16:28.248
I hate for something
to go wrong.

16:36.082 --> 16:37.344
you know I'’m there.

16:37.344 --> 16:38.693
Okay.

16:55.057 --> 16:57.190
and cause the prop
not to be able

16:57.190 --> 17:00.236
to maneuver the boat
as we want it to maneuver.

17:00.236 --> 17:02.238
It'’s very dangerous.

17:13.423 --> 17:16.339
It'’s completely around the prop.

17:18.254 --> 17:19.951
What the [bleep]?

17:27.568 --> 17:30.353
- Okay, cool.
- You got it?

17:38.274 --> 17:39.928
, yes.

17:39.928 --> 17:42.757
I handled that sh--
like a boss.

17:42.757 --> 17:44.933
We'’ll put it on the deck.
We don'’t need it in the water

17:44.933 --> 17:46.326
if there'’s nothing
attached to it.

17:50.156 --> 17:51.809
- Good luck.
- Adios.

17:53.289 --> 17:55.422
Okay, everyone'’s gotta go down.

17:55.422 --> 17:58.207
First course.

18:01.471 --> 18:02.820
You all right?

18:05.127 --> 18:06.476
Wow.

18:06.476 --> 18:07.695
Normally you have to
wash plates in between.

18:07.695 --> 18:09.305
Yeah.

18:09.305 --> 18:10.828
So we'’ve got enough plates
to get us through the course.

18:10.828 --> 18:12.047
- Well, that'’s good at least.
- How'’s laundry?

18:12.047 --> 18:13.440
Good.

18:13.440 --> 18:14.702
I'’m gonna do a
tour de cutlery right now.

18:14.702 --> 18:15.964
Alrighty.

18:15.964 --> 18:16.965
You'’re done, eh?

18:16.965 --> 18:17.922
For now?

18:21.665 --> 18:23.014
Frickin'’ dreadlock.

18:26.714 --> 18:28.672
We may have to lift
that in the jetskis.

18:31.675 --> 18:34.069
Okay, that'’s a party box.

18:37.855 --> 18:39.509
Oh, [bleep].

18:40.554 --> 18:41.990
Oh, my God.

18:41.990 --> 18:44.819
, it'’s like those
ships at the fun fair.

18:51.086 --> 18:52.305
It'’s nice.

18:52.305 --> 18:53.828
- All good?
- You'’re on the money.

18:53.828 --> 18:55.525
Thank you.
We smashed it.

18:55.525 --> 18:56.874
- Good day.
- Yeah, it was good.

18:56.874 --> 18:58.702
I'’ll go shower and
put my blacks on.

18:58.702 --> 19:00.095
That'’s all your meals
you'’re gonna be working in.

19:00.095 --> 19:01.401
That'’s ambitious.

19:01.401 --> 19:02.924
- It'’s gonna be a fiesta.
- Wow.

19:02.924 --> 19:05.492
I like Luka being head
of our department.

19:05.492 --> 19:07.972
Yeah. He'’s nice.

19:10.366 --> 19:11.802
Hi, girl.

19:11.802 --> 19:14.196
Uh, do you want me to
do anything else while...

19:14.196 --> 19:16.459
On top of this dinner,
they want a music festival.

19:16.459 --> 19:17.678
I have everything.

19:17.678 --> 19:19.027
Can I get you to start
decorating that?

19:19.027 --> 19:21.334
Should I bring the whole bin
of EDM stuff up?

19:21.334 --> 19:22.813
- Please?
- Okay.

19:22.813 --> 19:24.815
They have an amazing night,
get an amazing tip.

19:24.815 --> 19:26.687
We'’ll all wear wigs and stuff.

19:31.735 --> 19:33.389
All right. Nice.

19:33.389 --> 19:34.651
- Let'’s go, guys.
- Do it.

19:35.522 --> 19:38.002
Phew. Thank God.

19:41.571 --> 19:43.312
Pan fried venison.

19:43.312 --> 19:45.227
Cumin roasted carrot
balsamic sauce.

19:45.227 --> 19:46.750
That'’s what I do.

19:46.750 --> 19:48.839
This is one of these side
effects of being such a wizard.

19:48.839 --> 19:51.755
You'’re doing so much good stuff
that you forget half of it.

19:51.755 --> 19:53.888
With so many courses,
there'’s a lot that can go wrong,

19:53.888 --> 19:56.020
but I'’m fairly confident
because Natalya'’s on

19:56.020 --> 19:57.674
that it should be fine.

19:57.674 --> 19:59.850
Luka, Luka, can you please
come to the bridge?

19:59.850 --> 20:01.243
Is that all the deco right
behind the bar there?

20:01.243 --> 20:02.723
Yes.

20:02.723 --> 20:04.246
I can'’t work with this.
There'’s nothing here.

20:04.246 --> 20:05.856
- What can I do for you?
- How'’s your deck team?

20:05.856 --> 20:07.728
They'’re amazing.
The thing is, they love it.

20:07.728 --> 20:08.946
You know, they'’re
actually into it.

20:08.946 --> 20:10.557
Yeah.

20:10.557 --> 20:12.080
And you were very humble in
the beginning and very helpful.

20:12.080 --> 20:14.387
- Yeah.
- So, thank you.

20:14.387 --> 20:15.736
It'’s been amazing.

20:15.736 --> 20:18.956
So, Ru, he'’s not coming
back to the boat.

20:18.956 --> 20:22.438
So, will you be
the full-time bosun?

20:25.746 --> 20:27.791
- I would love to.
- I would love that.

20:27.791 --> 20:29.228
Amazing.

20:29.228 --> 20:30.751
By our next charter,
you'’ll have a new deckhand.

20:30.751 --> 20:32.753
This whole time,
I'’m thinking,

20:32.753 --> 20:34.276
yeah, sweet, someone else
is going to come in

20:34.276 --> 20:35.582
and take the position back,

20:35.582 --> 20:36.887
but now the
- ing pressure'’s on.

20:36.887 --> 20:38.411
Like, the season'’s
only just begun.

20:38.411 --> 20:42.284
We haven'’t even put
this thing on the dock yet.

20:42.284 --> 20:44.895
- Yeah, well, congratulations.
- Only been a few days.

20:44.895 --> 20:46.114
- Tell the crew.
- Okay.

20:46.114 --> 20:46.941
Yeah.

20:46.941 --> 20:48.116
I have confidence in Luka

20:48.116 --> 20:50.945
because Jason
highly recommended Luka.

20:50.945 --> 20:53.600
He'’s smart. He's quick.
He can call distances.

20:53.600 --> 20:58.213
How far is from this
boat to that barge?

20:58.213 --> 20:59.388
That'’s right.

20:59.388 --> 21:00.998
Does everything
without resistance.

21:00.998 --> 21:04.132
It was all those little
moments that made me go,

21:04.132 --> 21:05.394
wow, he'’s a leader.

21:05.394 --> 21:07.222
All right.
Thank you so much.

21:07.222 --> 21:10.486
Can I please have all
interior and whoever

21:10.486 --> 21:13.489
can assist with service
to the galley, please?

21:15.012 --> 21:16.579
But I figured some of
them are sitting here.

21:16.579 --> 21:17.928
I can crack
at least some of this.

21:17.928 --> 21:19.800
- What did you do?
- I talked to Sandy.

21:19.800 --> 21:22.759
Ru'’s not coming back.
Promoted me to bosun.

21:22.759 --> 21:25.762
You'’re Daddy bosun.
You'’re my, my boss.

21:25.762 --> 21:27.808
Yeah.
Pretty cool, right?

21:27.808 --> 21:29.810
Daddy bosun.
I like it.

21:29.810 --> 21:31.986
- Hey!
- Who'’s ready to take a seat?

21:31.986 --> 21:33.509
Natalya!

21:33.509 --> 21:34.989
- Are you ready for this?
- Ish.

21:34.989 --> 21:36.207
I think you'’re going
to kick ass.

21:36.207 --> 21:37.383
Thanks.

21:37.383 --> 21:39.776
Nat, did you want
me going down?

21:41.822 --> 21:43.345
It'’s a big night ahead of us.

21:43.345 --> 21:45.173
They brought the good
china out.

21:45.173 --> 21:46.783
It is truffle risotto.

21:46.783 --> 21:49.090
Say Italian truffle risotto.

21:49.090 --> 21:51.788
- Oh, there they come.
- Holy crapola.

21:51.788 --> 21:54.530
We have an Italian truffle
risotto with soft herbs.

21:54.530 --> 21:55.662
- You ready?
- Yes.

21:55.662 --> 21:57.316
- All right.
- Foodies.

21:57.316 --> 21:58.317
- You like it?
- Oh yeah, dude.

21:58.317 --> 21:59.753
- Perfect.
- Yeah.

21:59.753 --> 22:01.189
This is exactly how risotto
supposed to be made.

22:01.189 --> 22:02.146
- Yeah.
- Wow.

22:06.542 --> 22:08.196
- Very nice,
- Good?

22:12.853 --> 22:14.985
- My name is Jess.
- Yeah, Jess.

22:14.985 --> 22:16.857
Smoked salmon and
cream cheese Ballantine

22:16.857 --> 22:18.206
- with beetroot coral twill.
- Thank you.

22:18.206 --> 22:19.816
You say the end part.

22:19.816 --> 22:21.644
I'’ll say the smoked salmon
and cream cheese Ballantine .

22:21.644 --> 22:22.993
You got it all, girl.

22:26.040 --> 22:28.085
Okay.
We have a smoked salmon

22:28.085 --> 22:33.700
and cream cheese Ballantine
with beetroot and a coral twine.

22:33.700 --> 22:35.092
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

22:35.092 --> 22:36.398
That was good.

22:36.398 --> 22:38.705
Ugh... no.

22:38.705 --> 22:40.184
That was amazing.
No mistakes yet.

22:40.184 --> 22:42.012
Can you guys speak?

22:42.012 --> 22:43.753
I can'’t even remember
the bosun'’s name anymore.

22:45.320 --> 22:46.626
Luka.

22:46.626 --> 22:48.062
Tell him, instead of
her doing the dishes,

22:48.062 --> 22:50.499
if she can please just
focus on that sundeck.

22:50.499 --> 22:51.500
- Haleigh?
- Haleigh.

22:51.500 --> 22:52.849
- Got it'’
- Mm-hmm.

22:52.849 --> 22:55.199
Luka, if Haleigh can go
up to the sundeck

22:55.199 --> 22:57.376
and help Brooke set up
the EDM party.

22:57.376 --> 22:59.552
I just don'’t know how
to decorate that well.

22:59.552 --> 23:01.075
Pretend it'’s your birthday party

23:01.075 --> 23:02.946
and what you want there,
just boom, boom, boom, boom.

23:02.946 --> 23:04.557
Team work makes the dream work.

23:04.557 --> 23:05.645
Yes, and Brooke will
meet you up there.

23:05.645 --> 23:07.168
All right.

23:07.168 --> 23:09.692
I don'’t think I've ever
decorated for a party.

23:09.692 --> 23:11.433
I went to a rave.

23:11.433 --> 23:16.743
I'’m like, I know it's like beads
and neon lights and ecstasy,

23:16.743 --> 23:19.398
and I had one of the three,

23:19.398 --> 23:23.097
so do I just start
duct taping things?

23:23.097 --> 23:25.273
<i>Brooke, Brooke, can
you square up cabins,</i>

23:25.273 --> 23:27.144
like in the next
five minutes or so,

23:27.144 --> 23:30.409
and just focus on that
decoration on the Sundeck?

23:30.409 --> 23:32.193
Copy.

23:34.891 --> 23:36.806
What is calvados jus?

23:36.806 --> 23:38.895
You know jus
is a fancy word for sauce.

23:38.895 --> 23:41.158
Calvados is apple liqueur.
It goes nice with pork.

23:41.158 --> 23:43.552
- Can I say apple liqueur?
- No, just say calvados jus.

23:43.552 --> 23:45.075
Thank you.

23:49.689 --> 23:52.431
Okay.

23:52.431 --> 23:53.823
Calvados jus.

23:56.347 --> 23:57.740
Thank you.

23:57.740 --> 24:00.482
So we have a braised pork cheek
with calvados jus.

24:00.482 --> 24:01.962
Oh, it just melts in your mouth.

24:01.962 --> 24:04.617
I'’m going to put
this here maybe.

24:06.183 --> 24:08.185
We should probably
check on the Sundeck.

24:09.970 --> 24:11.754
Okay.
Where'’s Brookey Brooke?

24:11.754 --> 24:13.843
She'’s not here, and
I am really trying,

24:13.843 --> 24:15.410
- but the only thing I put out...
- Holy crap.

24:15.410 --> 24:17.586
- Wait, where'’s Brooke?
- Where'’s Brooke?

24:17.586 --> 24:19.153
- Was she ever here?
- Uh-uh.

24:19.153 --> 24:20.763
Oh my God, can you
run for Brooke?

24:20.763 --> 24:22.591
<i>- Brooke, Brooke, Brooke.</i>
- How about this?

24:22.591 --> 24:23.592
<i>What'’s your location?</i>

24:23.592 --> 24:25.507
Heading up to Sundeck now.

24:25.507 --> 24:27.117
I'’ve been a solo stew before.

24:27.117 --> 24:28.597
I'’m used to working late nights.

24:28.597 --> 24:29.859
I'’m used to running off coffee.

24:29.859 --> 24:31.382
My blood is coffee,

24:31.382 --> 24:34.777
so I guess this bitch is
going to have to pull it off.

24:36.649 --> 24:37.780
So...

24:38.651 --> 24:40.000
Coming up...

24:40.000 --> 24:41.131
Cheers.

24:45.745 --> 24:49.270
I'’ve got lust for Luka, but I've
got love for my boyfriend.

24:49.270 --> 24:51.533
The confusion is real.

24:51.533 --> 24:53.056
What?

24:56.843 --> 24:59.323
Brooke, Brooke, Brooke.
We need you on the Sundeck.

24:59.323 --> 25:00.455
Please, hurry.

25:00.455 --> 25:03.893
<i>Heading up now.</i>

25:03.893 --> 25:06.940
Can you lead service for
the next couple of meals?

25:08.158 --> 25:09.290
Yeah.
You'’re the chief stew.

25:09.290 --> 25:11.292
You should be leading service.

25:11.292 --> 25:14.338
I can set up the EDM party.
I'’m a raver.

25:14.338 --> 25:16.253
I'’m just not used
to leading service.

25:16.253 --> 25:17.603
There'’s so much pressure.

25:17.603 --> 25:18.995
Like, don'’t do that to me.

25:18.995 --> 25:20.997
Okay, sounds good.

25:21.998 --> 25:23.130
Why don'’t you ask?

25:23.130 --> 25:25.828
- Natalya.
- This is a nightmare.

25:25.828 --> 25:27.134
We'’ve got 40 minutes.

25:27.134 --> 25:29.266
Let'’s just start
getting sh-- up.

25:29.266 --> 25:31.007
Should I crack
all these glow sticks?

25:31.007 --> 25:32.226
They last a while, don'’t they?

25:32.226 --> 25:34.184
- Oh, my gosh.
- What'’s up?

25:34.184 --> 25:38.275
The Sundeck isn'’t set up,
so I have to lead service now.

25:38.275 --> 25:39.929
We are literally
at the last dinner.

25:39.929 --> 25:41.844
The guests are
ready to be cleared.

25:41.844 --> 25:43.629
Can I get some hands please?

25:43.629 --> 25:45.326
Can you please run down
and help clear?

25:45.326 --> 25:46.936
How does an American flag go?

25:46.936 --> 25:48.851
It'’s not this way, is it?

25:48.851 --> 25:50.287
Yeah, right?

25:55.771 --> 25:57.860
I was tying the string,
but it'’s like a piece of sh--.

25:57.860 --> 25:59.122
Okay, I'’ll take it.

25:59.122 --> 26:00.341
Running around
with your head cut off,

26:00.341 --> 26:02.082
- Training as we go as well.
- Yeah.

26:02.082 --> 26:03.518
Well, it'’s the last day?

26:03.518 --> 26:05.302
That'’s why I wanted to
make sure this was set.

26:05.302 --> 26:07.609
It can'’t be extravaganza
if there'’s nothing.

26:07.609 --> 26:09.002
Oh, that'’s broken now.

26:09.002 --> 26:10.264
Would you like more red wine?

26:10.264 --> 26:11.744
- That'’s the different wine.
- Oh.

26:11.744 --> 26:13.789
- That'’s not the same wine.
- Well, you love blends.

26:13.789 --> 26:15.138
We'’re blending.

26:15.138 --> 26:16.357
Jess told me this one.

26:16.357 --> 26:17.271
No, no.

26:17.271 --> 26:18.402
I will get you a new one then.

26:18.402 --> 26:22.363
Okay.

26:22.363 --> 26:25.322
Please, Nat.
Come back.

26:25.322 --> 26:26.541
God, this is getting random.

26:26.541 --> 26:27.977
Should I throw
them on the floor?

26:27.977 --> 26:29.022
No, that'’s a bit weird.

26:29.022 --> 26:30.763
We serve on the left.

26:30.763 --> 26:35.245
Serve like, don'’t place...
I can'’t. I'm having like...

26:36.856 --> 26:38.553
We all set at the same time.

26:38.553 --> 26:41.034
- Okay, I'’ll look at you.
- Yeah, just look at me.

26:41.034 --> 26:43.036
You got this.

26:43.036 --> 26:45.691
- I'’m just taking three.
- I'’ll take three.

26:45.691 --> 26:47.214
I'’ll take two, though,
in the guide of us.

26:47.214 --> 26:48.432
Once it'’s garnished,
it'’s ready?

26:48.432 --> 26:49.738
Yeah, indeed.

26:49.738 --> 26:53.699
Okay, we have
octopus chorizo saffron aioli.

26:53.699 --> 26:55.570
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

26:55.570 --> 26:57.572
- It'’s good. Very good.
- It'’s really good.

26:57.572 --> 27:00.227
I don'’t know how he's doing all
this by himself in the kitchen.

27:00.227 --> 27:02.185
Apparently, we just
chucked him in the cycle.

27:02.185 --> 27:03.752
Oh, my...
Shut up.

27:03.752 --> 27:05.232
That'’s pretty cool.

27:05.232 --> 27:08.191
Rose branzino, heirloom tomatoes
and burrata cheese.

27:08.191 --> 27:10.237
This is crackhead energy.

27:10.237 --> 27:12.108
Burrata cheese, burrata cheese,
burrata cheese.

27:12.108 --> 27:14.284
There, do you want to go?

27:14.284 --> 27:15.808
This is called
the so random rave cave.

27:15.808 --> 27:17.897
<i>Nat, Nat, we'’re going
to need you down here.</i>

27:17.897 --> 27:19.289
Sure thing.

27:19.289 --> 27:22.641
We have rose branzino
with heirloom tomato

27:22.641 --> 27:25.078
and burrata cheese.

27:25.078 --> 27:26.079
Oh, my God.

27:26.079 --> 27:27.428
It'’s nice.

27:27.428 --> 27:29.343
It'’s been crazy,
but we'’re doing it.

27:29.343 --> 27:30.736
That'’s what it's about,
isn'’t it?

27:30.736 --> 27:33.303
- Do you need her anymore?
- No. Thank you so much.

27:33.303 --> 27:34.827
We got two deck jobs
to do tonight.

27:34.827 --> 27:38.134
No, that'’s amazing.
Shots on me tomorrow.

27:38.134 --> 27:40.397
Literally, on me if you want to.
We'’ll see what happens.

27:43.096 --> 27:44.401
- Oh, my God.
- Saddle of venison.

27:44.401 --> 27:46.839
We have cumin carrots
and balsamic.

27:46.839 --> 27:48.101
They want to kill us with food.

27:48.101 --> 27:50.103
- Let'’s go, ladies.
- Thank you.

27:50.103 --> 27:51.234
What type of meat is this?

27:51.234 --> 27:52.714
Do you know the deer that died?

27:52.714 --> 27:54.150
That'’s on this plate.

27:54.150 --> 27:57.284
EDM night is going to be,
like, in our graves.

27:57.284 --> 27:59.286
Why do I feel more
confident in a wig?

27:59.286 --> 28:00.679
Oh!

28:00.679 --> 28:02.550
So we had a saddle of venison

28:02.550 --> 28:06.815
with cumin carrots
and balsamic glaze.

28:06.815 --> 28:08.121
Yeah, that'’s nice.

28:08.121 --> 28:09.513
His heart and soul
is in this food.

28:09.513 --> 28:11.124
We got to bring Jack
to Los Angeles.

28:11.124 --> 28:12.691
We'’ll invest in
a restaurant for him.

28:12.691 --> 28:13.909
Dude, for sure.

28:13.909 --> 28:15.302
They got it now.
You know what I mean?

28:15.302 --> 28:16.999
You know what I mean?

28:16.999 --> 28:18.566
We can help them, maybe,
now and then,

28:18.566 --> 28:19.785
but if we do it too much,
they'’re just going to...

28:19.785 --> 28:21.438
Yeah, boy.

28:21.438 --> 28:23.136
- I know.
- You see all this sh--?

28:23.136 --> 28:24.877
- Yeah.
- It'’s all just salt.

28:24.877 --> 28:27.488
And you'’ve just got to
soak it real, real good.

28:27.488 --> 28:29.142
This is, like,
my safe side up here.

28:29.142 --> 28:30.665
I feel safer up here.

28:30.665 --> 28:32.319
Come to me.

28:32.319 --> 28:35.670
That sh-- was scary,
but at the same time,

28:35.670 --> 28:37.324
if they'’re happy,
I'’m happy.

28:37.324 --> 28:39.761
And I see that.
I can do it all except exterior.

28:39.761 --> 28:41.154
Don'’t put me out there.

28:41.154 --> 28:43.286
- Where'’s my wig?
- Here. You'’re pink.

28:43.286 --> 28:45.593
I'’m pink. Me?

28:45.593 --> 28:47.987
Let'’s go. Let's go.
Time to party!

28:47.987 --> 28:49.292
Woo!

28:49.292 --> 28:51.642
Welcome to the Ravecave!

28:51.642 --> 28:52.513
Ow, ow, ow!

28:52.513 --> 28:54.950
- All right.
- Woo! Woo!

28:54.950 --> 28:58.084
- Shots!
- Woo!

28:58.084 --> 28:59.825
There'’s big ships
and little ships,

28:59.825 --> 29:02.653
but there'’s no ships
like friendships.

29:02.653 --> 29:05.047
Aw!
Cheers!

29:05.047 --> 29:06.135
I actually want to
lose my dinner

29:06.135 --> 29:07.963
over that corny-ass speech.

29:07.963 --> 29:09.835
Oh!

29:09.835 --> 29:11.227
I'’m not going to lie.

29:11.227 --> 29:12.794
I think I'’m pretty solid
at being chief stew.

29:12.794 --> 29:15.231
Fingers crossed that when
the new chief stew comes on,

29:15.231 --> 29:17.146
we have an actual dream team.

29:17.146 --> 29:18.713
Last year, I thought I had one,

29:18.713 --> 29:20.367
and that just
went crashing down.

29:20.367 --> 29:22.021
I'’ve set the table.
The orange juice is done.

29:22.021 --> 29:23.022
The pantry'’s clear.

29:23.022 --> 29:24.110
You'’re not supposed to...

29:24.110 --> 29:25.415
And I appreciate that so much,

29:25.415 --> 29:26.460
but I don'’t want you
to be extra...

29:26.460 --> 29:27.853
Well, clearly----ing not.

29:27.853 --> 29:29.637
That needs to be managed better.
Can'’t be...

29:29.637 --> 29:30.899
The boat'’s a sh-- show
from the bridge deck down,

29:30.899 --> 29:32.205
and nothing'’s pulled at all.

29:32.205 --> 29:34.468
- I'’m just taking it day-by-day.
- Woo!

29:34.468 --> 29:36.557
- Come on!
- Oh, oh, oh!

29:36.557 --> 29:38.037
Yeah!

29:38.037 --> 29:39.473
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle!

29:39.473 --> 29:40.735
I'’ll be back in a minute.

29:40.735 --> 29:41.997
Can I get you anything
from downstairs?

29:41.997 --> 29:43.390
No, sweetheart.
I'’m good.

29:43.390 --> 29:45.696
Amazing.
I'’ll be back.

29:47.568 --> 29:48.482
Yeah.

29:48.482 --> 29:49.918
- Get up at 8:00.
- Thanks, Nat.

29:49.918 --> 29:51.180
Oh, sh--!

29:51.180 --> 29:53.226
Oh, my God!

29:53.226 --> 29:55.402
My body hurts.

29:55.402 --> 29:57.752
Bedtime.
We had an awesome night.

29:57.752 --> 30:00.189
Thank you for everything.
It was awesome.

30:00.189 --> 30:01.321
Thank you so much.

30:01.321 --> 30:02.757
Have a good night'’s sleep.

30:02.757 --> 30:04.803
Party'’s over.
Time to go to sleep.

30:11.113 --> 30:12.898
Got...

30:12.898 --> 30:14.334
This is tomorrow'’s problem.

30:16.771 --> 30:17.772
Hey, babe.

30:17.772 --> 30:18.947
Oh, my God.
I'’m----ing dead.

30:18.947 --> 30:20.253
I'’m just going to bed now.

30:20.253 --> 30:21.776
I'’ve got to wake up
in four hours.

30:21.776 --> 30:23.473
It'’s chaotic.

30:30.916 --> 30:33.440
I don'’t even want to know
what you'’ve been up to.

30:33.440 --> 30:35.094
Have sex with anyone?

30:36.922 --> 30:39.141
I just don'’t care right now
because I'’m so tired.

30:51.153 --> 30:53.242
I hate my life.

31:14.698 --> 31:16.265
Luka, Luka, Nat.

31:16.265 --> 31:18.833
Could you run me down a bottle
of those small glass waters

31:18.833 --> 31:19.965
from the Sundeck, please?

31:19.965 --> 31:21.444
How many would you like?

31:21.444 --> 31:22.968
I just need to put one
in every person'’s spot

31:22.968 --> 31:24.665
at the breakfast table.

31:24.665 --> 31:26.362
- You all right?
- I'’m like about to pass out.

31:26.362 --> 31:27.668
- You had some coffee?
- Yeah.

31:27.668 --> 31:29.583
- Hey, brother.
- How are you doing?

31:29.583 --> 31:31.628
How do you guys feel
the trip went?

31:31.628 --> 31:33.195
- Pretty happy with it.
- I mean, we nailed it.

31:33.195 --> 31:34.893
Are you guys going
to get someone?

31:34.893 --> 31:36.285
Yeah, we'’re going to get another
deckie for the next trip.

31:36.285 --> 31:37.634
Do you guys...
I might...

31:37.634 --> 31:39.810
I might actually might
swap to the deck.

31:39.810 --> 31:41.595
- Come!
- Should I?

31:48.776 --> 31:50.082
Good morning.

31:50.082 --> 31:51.300
Let me get you a coffee.

31:51.300 --> 31:53.737
Yeah, coffee would be great.

31:53.737 --> 31:55.348
Yesterday, there was a few
hiccups for breakfast.

31:55.348 --> 31:57.219
You know, over easy,
over medium,

31:57.219 --> 31:58.481
like "potayto", "potahto".

31:58.481 --> 31:59.874
So I'’m making a quiche.

31:59.874 --> 32:04.357
A monkey with no eyes
would make a quiche.

32:04.357 --> 32:06.141
I feel like I got
hit by a train.

32:06.141 --> 32:07.360
Good morning.

32:07.360 --> 32:08.839
I'’m good.
How are you?

32:08.839 --> 32:10.972
Okay?

32:10.972 --> 32:12.931
Are you keen to have
a drink with me tonight?

32:12.931 --> 32:16.369
Don'’t threaten me
with a good time.

32:16.369 --> 32:18.153
I can have fun, you know.

32:18.153 --> 32:19.894
All right, I'’m not from Ireland.

32:19.894 --> 32:21.374
Oh, wasn'’t good, was it?
Not a good accent.

32:21.374 --> 32:23.202
Every time someone does it,

32:23.202 --> 32:24.986
it'’s terrible,
but they think it'’s good.

32:24.986 --> 32:26.205
Luka, Luka.

32:26.205 --> 32:28.729
We need to be hauling
anchor at 11:30.

32:28.729 --> 32:30.600
Copy that, and we just got
to pull up the slide.

32:30.600 --> 32:33.038
Would you like some brunch?
Chef made quiches.

32:33.038 --> 32:34.169
Yeah, let'’s do that.

32:34.169 --> 32:35.344
Coming around.

32:35.344 --> 32:37.956
- Is there a faster speed?
- Sorry.

32:39.827 --> 32:43.439
- Coming up with sausages.
- The bacon'’s ready as well.

32:43.439 --> 32:45.615
yeah.
That was all good.

32:45.615 --> 32:48.183
- Yeah.
- Crispy bacon and sausage.

32:48.183 --> 32:50.751
<i>Ah, Luka, Luka. We could
start hauling the anchor.</i>

32:50.751 --> 32:51.970
Ow, my feet.

32:51.970 --> 32:54.624
You have more
French donuts downstairs?

32:54.624 --> 32:55.843
- French donuts?
- Yeah.

32:55.843 --> 32:57.105
- Croissants.
- Croissants, got it.

32:57.105 --> 32:58.628
I can look.

32:58.628 --> 33:00.239
If you yell out, and
I'’ll give you the signal.

33:00.239 --> 33:02.806
Yeah, so I tell you what,
and then you just give, yeah.

33:02.806 --> 33:04.678
I'’ll stand here
so I can see both.

33:04.678 --> 33:06.114
Go ahead and start
hauling the anchor.

33:06.114 --> 33:08.464
Copy, we'’re hauling.

33:08.464 --> 33:10.336
There'’s four shackles on deck.

33:10.336 --> 33:12.903
Just hold up, stop,
stop, stop, stop, stop.

33:12.903 --> 33:15.950
There'’s a whole brick
attached to our anchor.

33:15.950 --> 33:17.038
Oh, God.

33:17.038 --> 33:18.039
Yeah.

33:18.039 --> 33:19.301
Sandy, Sandy, Luka.

33:19.301 --> 33:21.782
There'’s a brick attached
to the anchor.

33:21.782 --> 33:25.351
We need to go down there
and cut it off or something.

33:25.351 --> 33:26.961
What the [bleep]?

33:26.961 --> 33:29.572
I wonder if there was
a body attached to that.

33:33.054 --> 33:35.665
There'’s a whole brick
attached to our anchor.

33:35.665 --> 33:37.450
- See that thing?
- Oh, God.

33:37.450 --> 33:38.451
Yeah.

33:38.451 --> 33:39.756
Sandy, Sandy.

33:39.756 --> 33:42.498
There'’s a brick attached
to the anchor.

33:42.498 --> 33:43.804
We'’re going to have
to get on the tender

33:43.804 --> 33:45.806
- and jump down and cut it off.
- Okay.

33:45.806 --> 33:47.938
Yo, have you got like
an old knife I can use?

33:47.938 --> 33:50.767
Just to cut a
line on the anchor?

33:50.767 --> 33:53.118
There'’s a brick attached to it.

33:53.118 --> 33:56.077
Butterknife, steak knife.
Ah, there it is.

33:56.077 --> 33:57.339
Brick knife.

33:57.339 --> 33:58.558
For the anchor, yeah?

33:59.689 --> 34:01.822
Should we pull it up a bit?

34:01.822 --> 34:02.823
Yeah.

34:04.738 --> 34:07.480
- Got it?
- Yeah.

34:07.480 --> 34:08.481
These can all go.

34:08.481 --> 34:09.699
Copy that.

34:13.529 --> 34:15.270
Okay. Up!

34:19.013 --> 34:20.449
Good job.

34:20.449 --> 34:22.103
Primary.

34:22.103 --> 34:23.844
You can start airing
up your fenders.

34:23.844 --> 34:26.107
So far, the deck team is
a pleasant surprise.

34:26.107 --> 34:28.501
Luka has the
right temperament as a leader.

34:28.501 --> 34:30.068
He is totally chill.

34:30.068 --> 34:32.548
And Haleigh and Lara,
they don'’t seem to get rattled.

34:32.548 --> 34:34.768
Fingers crossed,
this docking goes well.

34:34.768 --> 34:37.292
This is trash, and
it smells like dookie.

34:37.292 --> 34:38.772
Here'’s some quiche.

34:38.772 --> 34:40.165
Do you want me to pop that
just in front of you?

34:40.165 --> 34:41.383
- Veggie quiche.
- Yes.

34:41.383 --> 34:42.732
Good.

34:42.732 --> 34:45.648
- He got the eggs right.
- He got the eggs right.

34:45.648 --> 34:47.346
You guys try the quiche?

34:47.346 --> 34:48.999
Really nice.

34:48.999 --> 34:51.480
That'’s what I was about to do.
Great minds think alike.

34:51.480 --> 34:53.178
I'’m just on your
wavelength today.

34:53.178 --> 34:56.181
ETA to the pilot station
is one hour.

34:56.181 --> 34:57.225
Copy that.

34:57.225 --> 34:59.009
Did he tell you
that he got bosun?

34:59.009 --> 35:00.359
Seriously.

35:00.359 --> 35:01.882
Ru'’s not coming back,
so Sandy made him bosun

35:01.882 --> 35:03.318
and we'’re getting
another deckhand.

35:03.318 --> 35:04.667
ing amazing.

35:04.667 --> 35:06.104
Jeez, Louise.

35:06.104 --> 35:08.715
This is awesome, guys.
Thanks for the invite.

35:08.715 --> 35:12.806
- Yeah.
- When'’s the next one?

35:12.806 --> 35:14.373
You didn'’t tell me that
you'’re bosun, though.

35:14.373 --> 35:15.722
- Oh, I thought I did.
- No.

35:15.722 --> 35:16.766
I just told her, you donkey.

35:16.766 --> 35:18.420
I love that you'’re bosun.

35:18.420 --> 35:20.161
We'’re just going to keep doing
exactly what we'’re doing

35:20.161 --> 35:21.380
- because we'’re smashing it.
- Congratulations.

35:21.380 --> 35:23.033
Thank you.

35:23.033 --> 35:24.905
I'’m definitely impressed
with how Luka'’s handling it.

35:24.905 --> 35:26.820
Like, if we still had Ru,

35:26.820 --> 35:28.735
this would have been
a different deck crew.

35:28.735 --> 35:31.303
He'’s gorgeous to
look at as well.

35:31.303 --> 35:32.347
God, he'’s hot.

35:32.347 --> 35:35.785
It makes me wish I was straight.

35:35.785 --> 35:37.700
- Bye, bosun.
- Bye.

35:37.700 --> 35:38.919
He'’s so sweet.

35:38.919 --> 35:42.052
That is a proper
final breakfast here.

35:42.052 --> 35:43.793
This is a memory of
a lifetime, really.

35:43.793 --> 35:45.317
Yeah, it is.

35:45.317 --> 35:47.101
<i>Fenders going over.
Pilot'’s approaching.</i>

35:47.101 --> 35:49.625
<i>Pilot boat three meters off.</i>

35:49.625 --> 35:51.279
- Hello.
- Hi.

35:51.279 --> 35:53.238
- Thank you. Hello.
<i>- That'’s the pilot on board.</i>

35:53.238 --> 35:54.239
On our way up to the bridge.

35:54.239 --> 35:55.762
- Bon giorno.
- Nice to meet you.

35:55.762 --> 35:57.111
You, too.

35:57.111 --> 35:59.287
First ground line
will be starboard side.

35:59.287 --> 36:00.897
Starboard side.

36:00.897 --> 36:02.464
<i>I'’m taking the bow
from the starboard wing.</i>

36:02.464 --> 36:04.771
<i>Copy that.
Me and Lara are on the stern.</i>

36:04.771 --> 36:05.859
<i>Haleigh'’s up on the bow.</i>

36:05.859 --> 36:07.687
We'’re going in.

36:07.687 --> 36:10.429
<i>It'’s your stern coming in line
with the end of the dock now.</i>

36:10.429 --> 36:11.430
45 meters.

36:11.430 --> 36:13.214
A little bit nervous.

36:13.214 --> 36:16.435
It'’s the first time I've ever
called a yacht to a dock.

36:16.435 --> 36:18.219
I want to make sure
Sandy knows I'’m calm.

36:18.219 --> 36:20.221
Even though inside I'’m like...

36:20.221 --> 36:24.138
Dude, like, we'’re going
to----ing hit the dock.

36:24.138 --> 36:26.358
35 meters to the dock,
starboard quarter.

36:26.358 --> 36:28.011
Sandy'’s backing it up.

36:28.011 --> 36:30.275
25 meters to the dock,
starboard quarter.

36:30.275 --> 36:33.713
15 meters to the dock,
starboard quarter.

36:33.713 --> 36:35.628
<i>Sandy, happy for us
to go with lines?</i>

36:35.628 --> 36:37.195
<i>Yeah, go ahead. Yeah.</i>

36:37.195 --> 36:40.459
Oh, caught another one.
It'’s that knot. Yeah.

36:40.459 --> 36:43.418
- Spring, spring.
- All right.

36:43.418 --> 36:46.116
- Holy hell.
- Two meters to starboard.

36:46.116 --> 36:47.683
Go ahead and tighten
the ground lines.

36:47.683 --> 36:49.424
- Just lock them off here.
- Yeah.

36:49.424 --> 36:50.512
Luka, are you good?

36:50.512 --> 36:52.122
We'’re all good on the stern.

36:52.122 --> 36:53.254
We'’re going to start
getting the passerelle out.

36:55.474 --> 36:56.649
Both headlines are on the winch.

36:56.649 --> 36:59.739
- Luka.
- Yeah. Is that all right?

36:59.739 --> 37:00.740
Incredible.
Great job.

37:00.740 --> 37:02.437
Thank you.

37:02.437 --> 37:04.352
I'’m going to have gray hairs by
the end of this----ing season.

37:04.352 --> 37:06.006
I'’m so stressed.

37:06.006 --> 37:07.877
And they did an awesome
job on the bow.

37:07.877 --> 37:10.402
The girls are smashing it.

37:10.402 --> 37:13.056
All crew, all crew.
In your whites now.

37:15.755 --> 37:18.758
All right.
We you----ing smashed that.

37:18.758 --> 37:20.847
- Yeah, we did.
- The whole trip.

37:20.847 --> 37:22.370
What a team.

37:22.370 --> 37:27.332
<i>All crew, all crew.
Let'’s meet on the dock.</i>

37:27.332 --> 37:29.377
Adios.
Hasta la vista.

37:29.377 --> 37:32.337
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you so much.

37:32.337 --> 37:34.164
- Bye.
- Bye.

37:34.164 --> 37:36.863
We'’re taking you with us.

37:36.863 --> 37:38.430
- What an experience.
- I know. Thank you.

37:38.430 --> 37:40.258
Your crew were incredible.

37:40.258 --> 37:43.826
You are the coolest
captain there ever was.

37:43.826 --> 37:47.700
Jack, I want to recognize you
for your skills in the chef.

37:47.700 --> 37:51.660
Natalya, thank you for really
treating us very, very special.

37:51.660 --> 37:52.748
Thank you for you and your crew.

37:52.748 --> 37:53.836
Thank you.

37:53.836 --> 37:56.099
- Cheers.
- Have a safe trip.

37:56.099 --> 37:57.666
- Bye.
- Bye. Thanks.

37:57.666 --> 38:00.365
All right, everyone. Out of
our whites, into our reds.

38:00.365 --> 38:01.453
Woo!

38:01.453 --> 38:02.932
And well done.

38:02.932 --> 38:04.717
First charter done.

38:04.717 --> 38:06.240
100 more to go.

38:06.240 --> 38:07.197
Ligma.

38:07.197 --> 38:09.591
- What is a lig?
- Oh, ligma bum.

38:09.591 --> 38:11.419
Lick my balls, put close.

38:11.419 --> 38:13.595
All crew. All crew.
Let'’s meet in the sky lounge

38:13.595 --> 38:16.076
for our tip meeting.

38:16.076 --> 38:18.905
- Can we squeeze in?
- Yeah.

38:18.905 --> 38:20.689
Incredible.

38:20.689 --> 38:22.169
Not what I expected.

38:22.169 --> 38:25.259
Everything that we went
through to get off the dock.

38:25.259 --> 38:27.696
Ru, unfortunately, didn'’t
have the correct paperwork.

38:27.696 --> 38:28.871
Yeah.

38:28.871 --> 38:32.179
And then witnessing some things.

38:32.179 --> 38:35.443
Because I pay attention in the
way you called it coming in.

38:35.443 --> 38:37.924
I'’ve always had
to correct people.

38:37.924 --> 38:41.275
I didn'’t have to.
And I knew.

38:41.275 --> 38:44.060
- He is our bosun.
- Thank you.

38:44.060 --> 38:45.758
Amazing support as well.

38:45.758 --> 38:49.457
I am so happy I have women
on deck watching you two.

38:49.457 --> 38:50.763
You just really dug in.

38:50.763 --> 38:53.069
We just worked
very well as a team.

38:53.069 --> 38:54.419
I think all of us.

38:54.419 --> 38:56.377
Jack, you set a bar.

38:56.377 --> 38:59.293
I'’m sorry.
You can'’t go below it. Ever.

38:59.293 --> 39:02.949
Natalya, stepping up,
knowing that we didn'’t have

39:02.949 --> 39:06.300
our chief and Kyle,
but then stepping back.

39:06.300 --> 39:08.128
So I just want to say thank you.

39:08.128 --> 39:09.651
- Don'’t you agree?
- Absolutely.

39:09.651 --> 39:11.697
Thanks, guys.

39:11.697 --> 39:13.002
Being crew members
down and, like,

39:13.002 --> 39:14.134
being thrown straight into it,

39:14.134 --> 39:15.178
I feel like we
actually had a

39:15.178 --> 39:16.658
very successful first charter.

39:16.658 --> 39:17.833
There'’s a couple little hiccups,

39:17.833 --> 39:19.531
but for being a first charter,

39:19.531 --> 39:23.317
smashed out the bull cart,
bull cart, ball park.

39:23.317 --> 39:25.624
Brooke, everything that you
did for us, thank you.

39:25.624 --> 39:27.408
Anytime.

39:27.408 --> 39:28.801
This will be your last night
with Brooke.

39:28.801 --> 39:30.411
Have fun.
Go out for dinner.

39:30.411 --> 39:32.848
Just show her your gratitude
because she helped us out.

39:32.848 --> 39:34.154
Yeah.

39:34.154 --> 39:39.507
So our total is $20,000,
$1,818 per person.

39:39.507 --> 39:41.335
Wow.

39:41.335 --> 39:42.945
Congratulations.
Thank you very much.

39:42.945 --> 39:44.730
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

39:44.730 --> 39:46.471
- Thanks.
- Yeah, boy.

39:46.471 --> 39:48.603
All right.
Let'’s do a top to bottom.

39:48.603 --> 39:49.822
Lovely, lovely.

39:49.822 --> 39:52.302
Oh, my goodness.
This crap everywhere.

39:54.653 --> 39:55.828
We'’ll knock off now.

39:55.828 --> 39:57.351
All right.
I'’m going to shower.

39:57.351 --> 39:58.570
Yeah, go for it.

40:00.659 --> 40:02.182
Where'’s your clothes?

40:02.182 --> 40:04.053
Well, I was about to shower.
Then there was no shampoo.

40:04.053 --> 40:05.403
She works on the interior.

40:05.403 --> 40:07.492
She knows where
the----ing shampoo is.

40:07.492 --> 40:09.407
I'’m free balling.
In the hallway.

40:09.407 --> 40:11.234
If there'’s one thing that gets
me in trouble on yachts,

40:11.234 --> 40:12.845
it'’s definitely the ladies.

40:12.845 --> 40:14.281
At the moment, I'’m single.

40:14.281 --> 40:15.804
I'’m keen to have some fun

40:15.804 --> 40:17.676
and not get into anything
too serious.

40:17.676 --> 40:19.678
Do you know that you guys
made out this night?

40:19.678 --> 40:21.506
Yeah.

40:23.377 --> 40:27.512
Natalya is definitely potential
trouble for myself.

40:27.512 --> 40:29.644
Are you going to try to
hook up with someone tonight?

40:29.644 --> 40:31.037
There'’s only two options.

40:31.037 --> 40:33.082
Unless you go both ways.

40:34.257 --> 40:35.737
If I'’m drunk,
I'’ll kiss a guy.

40:35.737 --> 40:39.349
But I recently decided that
it just makes me unhappy.

40:39.349 --> 40:41.656
In South Africa,
it'’s not very open.

40:41.656 --> 40:43.136
Yeah.

40:43.136 --> 40:44.354
My family is fine with it now.

40:44.354 --> 40:45.878
They are very conservative.

40:45.878 --> 40:47.053
Are they, like, accepting of it?

40:47.053 --> 40:48.620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

40:48.620 --> 40:49.664
They love me.

40:49.664 --> 40:51.231
It was actually in quarantine.

40:51.231 --> 40:54.016
when I realized the first
time that I like women,

40:54.016 --> 40:55.801
I don'’t like men.

40:55.801 --> 40:58.543
As soon as I came out and
really felt comfortable

40:58.543 --> 41:02.242
with that, it was like
I have wings to fly.

41:02.242 --> 41:04.200
Like, I'’m actually okay, Lara.

41:04.200 --> 41:07.377
You can accept yourself,
completely who you are.

41:07.377 --> 41:09.162
When I go home,
I do feel like I need

41:09.162 --> 41:10.903
to hide myself a little bit.

41:10.903 --> 41:12.905
My parents would
never write me off.

41:12.905 --> 41:14.254
They'’re amazing people.

41:14.254 --> 41:18.214
But they were just,
like, you are really

41:18.214 --> 41:20.478
stepping on some eggshells now.

41:20.478 --> 41:22.218
But it is never going
to change with them.

41:23.872 --> 41:26.571
Crew night out tonight.

41:26.571 --> 41:28.834
- Come on, let'’s go.
- Let'’s get----ed.

41:28.834 --> 41:31.097
Yeah, let'’s go.

41:31.097 --> 41:32.141
After you, ladies.

41:32.141 --> 41:34.579
Get in the car.
Get in the car.

41:34.579 --> 41:36.537
I love straight girls.

41:39.279 --> 41:42.848
I love a girly girl with
nails and a handbag.

41:44.240 --> 41:48.114
If you see us back here
on the way home.

41:48.114 --> 41:49.724
- Let'’s roll, mother----ers.
- Let'’s go.

41:51.813 --> 41:53.206
Wow, it'’s a castle.

41:53.206 --> 41:55.251
Oh, I can'’t wait to drink.

41:55.251 --> 41:57.471
I'’m not carrying anyone home.

41:57.471 --> 41:59.125
But someone might have to
carry me.

41:59.995 --> 42:01.606
Lara is a boss.

42:01.606 --> 42:03.564
All right, I need a drink.

42:03.564 --> 42:06.088
- Okiedoke.
- Something to drink?

42:06.088 --> 42:07.220
Can I have a margarita please?

42:07.220 --> 42:09.135
- Two, please.
- Three, please.

42:09.135 --> 42:10.702
Four, please.

42:10.702 --> 42:12.530
We love a tequila.

42:12.530 --> 42:13.792
- Let'’s go. We've got?
- Scouse.

42:13.792 --> 42:15.358
- Kiwi.
- America.

42:15.358 --> 42:16.708
- Americans.
- Afrikaans.

42:16.708 --> 42:18.710
- Australian.
- Hawaiian.

42:18.710 --> 42:19.841
Woo!

42:19.841 --> 42:21.495
What a motley crew.

42:21.495 --> 42:23.192
Margarita.

42:23.192 --> 42:25.804
Guys, that couldn'’t have gotten
any better for a first charter.

42:25.804 --> 42:27.719
I know it could go easily
downhill from here...

42:27.719 --> 42:28.850
- I hope not.
- Easy.

42:28.850 --> 42:30.156
Cheers.

42:30.156 --> 42:31.592
Are you excited for two
new crew members?

42:31.592 --> 42:33.289
I'’m really happy with
the crew right now.

42:33.289 --> 42:35.640
Kyle is, like, you guys
are going to love him.

42:35.640 --> 42:37.598
Can I ask you how do you
feel about being,

42:37.598 --> 42:38.817
you know, demoted?

42:38.817 --> 42:41.080
All I'’m saying is
this new chief stew

42:41.080 --> 42:42.211
best be----ing good now.

42:42.211 --> 42:44.692
Well, guess what?

42:44.692 --> 42:45.693
What does evicted mean?

42:45.693 --> 42:47.173
Evicted means...

42:47.173 --> 42:49.523
You don'’t know a lot of
the words that we use.

42:49.523 --> 42:54.093
I'’ve got a list of words that
I learn every day.

42:54.093 --> 42:56.704
In school,
Afrikaans was the language.

42:56.704 --> 42:58.576
And only when I went to,
like, high school,

42:58.576 --> 43:00.273
English was brought
into my life.

43:00.273 --> 43:03.624
And I tried many times
to improve the way I speak,

43:03.624 --> 43:05.452
to be more articulate.

43:05.452 --> 43:06.584
That'’s a big word for me.

43:06.584 --> 43:08.107
It'’s actually on my word list.

43:08.107 --> 43:10.065
- Let'’s go to the bar.
- Oh, my God.

43:10.892 --> 43:12.590
Let'’s us roll.

43:12.590 --> 43:14.113
Whoo!

43:14.113 --> 43:15.984
Oh, my God.
This is sick.

43:15.984 --> 43:18.508
- Yay!
- Whoo!

43:18.508 --> 43:22.904
Yay!

43:22.904 --> 43:24.645
Okay.

43:24.645 --> 43:26.473
- Love a drink.
- What are we going to do?

43:28.997 --> 43:30.608
Are you excited for your
new chief stew?

43:32.305 --> 43:34.089
What the hell is this?

43:34.089 --> 43:36.614
That'’s Otto.
Rugrats, baby.

43:36.614 --> 43:38.528
God, this is strong.

43:42.881 --> 43:43.795
I wanna see this one.

43:53.413 --> 43:55.067
There'’s lust
and there'’s love.

43:55.067 --> 43:56.503
I'’ve got lust for Luka,

43:56.503 --> 43:58.723
but I'’ve got love for my boyfriend.

43:58.723 --> 44:00.638
The confusion is real.

44:00.638 --> 44:03.858
Every girl has a love
heart on the bum from like 16.

44:04.946 --> 44:06.252
What?

44:06.252 --> 44:09.342
In the jacuzzi when
we have a jacuzzi party.

44:10.996 --> 44:12.214
Coming up...

44:12.214 --> 44:16.088
Where is the bridge?

44:16.088 --> 44:17.219
Hello!

44:17.219 --> 44:20.919
Finally you made it.

44:20.919 --> 44:22.485
I know.

44:22.485 --> 44:24.096
So this is a silverware
we'’ve been using for breakfast,

44:24.096 --> 44:25.358
lunch and dinner.

44:25.358 --> 44:26.881
The organization'’s
a sh---show.

44:26.881 --> 44:28.404
Excuse me?

44:37.892 --> 44:39.285
Tootsie roll.

44:39.285 --> 44:41.853
Shake your tootsie.

44:41.853 --> 44:42.941
You can actually do it.

44:47.946 --> 44:49.295
Whoo!

44:49.295 --> 44:50.470
Yes, queen.

44:54.648 --> 44:56.128
Do you want my titties on it?

44:56.128 --> 44:58.696
- Are you gonna flash me?
- Yeah, I'’m gonna flash you.

44:58.696 --> 45:00.349
I love it.

45:00.349 --> 45:02.830
- Oh, my God!
- Jesus.

45:02.830 --> 45:04.789
Haleigh'’s the most surprising person.

45:04.789 --> 45:06.225
She'’s like, oh, my God,
I'’m so shy.

45:06.225 --> 45:07.356
Do you guys want to see my tits?

45:07.356 --> 45:09.402
Like, it'’s very interesting.

45:09.402 --> 45:11.404
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

45:12.448 --> 45:14.407
- Oh, lonely boy.
- Hey, baby.

45:14.407 --> 45:16.061
Hey, there she is.

45:16.061 --> 45:17.627
Dude, I hate vans.

45:21.501 --> 45:22.763
10 o'’clock on deck.

45:22.763 --> 45:24.156
10 o'’clock as well
on the interior.

45:24.156 --> 45:26.854
- I'’m tired, dude.
- Exhausted.

45:26.854 --> 45:29.161
- Let'’s go, baby.
- Let'’s go, girls.

45:29.161 --> 45:30.336
Wee.

45:33.121 --> 45:34.166
We need sleep.

45:34.166 --> 45:36.298
I'’m kicking off.

45:36.298 --> 45:38.953
Look at this cabin.

45:38.953 --> 45:40.302
Ciao for now.

45:40.302 --> 45:42.522
Yeah, ciao for now.

46:12.117 --> 46:13.814
What'’s up, Paul?

46:15.860 --> 46:18.384
I feel like a walking
bottle of alcohol.

46:20.865 --> 46:22.518
- Captain.
- Hello there.

46:22.518 --> 46:24.129
I wanted to talk
about cabin arrangements.

46:24.129 --> 46:26.827
Do we know if the deck hand
coming is male or female?

46:26.827 --> 46:28.350
Male.

46:28.350 --> 46:30.265
So, you and Kyle are going
to be in the forward cabin.

46:30.265 --> 46:31.658
Yeah.

46:31.658 --> 46:33.094
And chief stew is going
to share with Jess.

46:33.094 --> 46:34.313
And I'’m going to share
with the other deckie.

46:34.313 --> 46:35.662
Great.

46:39.274 --> 46:41.059
How are you doing?
How'’d you sleep?

46:55.551 --> 46:56.857
Hi, officially chief stew.

46:56.857 --> 46:59.512
I'’m so happy you
got your visa.

46:59.512 --> 47:01.993
I'’ll see you this afternoon.

47:01.993 --> 47:03.603
I can'’t wait to
meet you in person.

47:03.603 --> 47:04.691
Terrific.
Bye-bye.

47:04.691 --> 47:05.910
Can you imagine that?

47:05.910 --> 47:07.563
We'’re going to have
two extra hands.

47:10.566 --> 47:12.786
Why do we do this to ourselves?

47:12.786 --> 47:15.702
- Never again.
- Never again.

47:15.702 --> 47:17.269
I'’m sad you're leaving.

47:17.269 --> 47:18.270
I'’m going to miss you guys.

47:18.270 --> 47:20.011
Bye.

47:20.011 --> 47:22.448
It was nice to see what
everyone is like

47:22.448 --> 47:24.145
when they have a
little bit of alcohol.

47:24.145 --> 47:25.538
100%.

47:29.585 --> 47:31.196
Captain Sandy, I'’m headed out.

47:31.196 --> 47:35.287
But I just wanted to thank
you for this opportunity.

47:35.287 --> 47:36.897
It'’s been amazing.

47:36.897 --> 47:39.204
I wish you could
stay as a deckhand.

47:39.204 --> 47:40.901
I just needed someone
with more experience.

47:40.901 --> 47:43.556
- Yeah.
- Nothing but praise.

47:43.556 --> 47:45.384
Oh, thank you.
That means a lot to me.

47:45.384 --> 47:46.776
- Yeah. Give me a hug.
- Sure.

47:46.776 --> 47:48.343
- Thank you so much.
- Stay safe.

47:48.343 --> 47:49.910
Okay, I will.

47:49.910 --> 47:54.175
I definitely think yachting
is the career path for me.

47:54.175 --> 47:55.611
So nice meeting you all.

47:55.611 --> 47:56.874
I'’m sure we can
see each other soon.

47:56.874 --> 47:58.136
I know. Bye.

47:58.136 --> 48:00.399
I want to give credit
to all of the stews

48:00.399 --> 48:03.184
because that is hard-ass work.

48:03.184 --> 48:04.794
Okay.

48:06.535 --> 48:08.102
What?

48:12.759 --> 48:14.587
When are your two coming?

48:14.587 --> 48:15.893
It'’s going to be so strange.

48:15.893 --> 48:16.850
Oh, I know.

48:21.289 --> 48:23.944
Does anybody have
a fitted sheet?

48:23.944 --> 48:26.077
I feel like we actually had a
very successful first charter.

48:26.077 --> 48:27.426
I'’ve established a
good relationship

48:27.426 --> 48:29.080
already with everyone.

48:29.080 --> 48:32.431
And on top of that, I'’ve set up
this yacht close to perfect.

48:32.431 --> 48:34.737
This is huge.

48:34.737 --> 48:36.565
It'’s going to be hard
to hand over the reins.

48:36.565 --> 48:38.132
I'’m just going to meet
her face-to-face

48:38.132 --> 48:40.961
and do face value and
just take it from there.

48:54.975 --> 48:59.240
Oh, it'’s so pretty!

48:59.240 --> 49:02.069
Where is the bridge?

49:05.072 --> 49:07.205
- Hello?
- Hi!

49:07.205 --> 49:08.946
Captain Sandy?

49:08.946 --> 49:11.470
- Hi!
- Hi. Finally!

49:11.470 --> 49:13.559
- I'’m here!
- You made it!

49:13.559 --> 49:15.039
I know.

49:15.039 --> 49:16.997
I feel like I'’ve been
waiting for this promotion

49:16.997 --> 49:19.608
as chief stew
since last charter season.

49:19.608 --> 49:21.741
Oh, the laundry looks amazing.

49:21.741 --> 49:23.569
You did such a good job.

49:23.569 --> 49:27.268
You'’ve been such a busy bee
while I'’ve been away.

49:27.268 --> 49:29.183
I will make you the mix, just
go get frozen strawberries.

49:29.183 --> 49:33.405
Why can'’t we deconstruct
the idea of a fondue bar?

49:33.405 --> 49:35.755
In my opinion, you should
be a chief stew right now.

49:35.755 --> 49:37.757
You are the concrete
of everything.

49:37.757 --> 49:39.193
Can you just kiss already?

49:39.193 --> 49:41.413
Don'’t blush, I know
you'’re getting red.

49:41.413 --> 49:44.329
I'’ve always wanted to work
in the med, and it'’s crazy.

49:44.329 --> 49:45.895
And as chiefy.

49:45.895 --> 49:47.593
Well, we missed you
on the first charter.

49:47.593 --> 49:50.248
Oh, my God, I wish I was here.

49:50.248 --> 49:51.684
And Kyle'’s coming later.

49:51.684 --> 49:53.381
- Yes, he is.
- So, that'’s great.

49:53.381 --> 49:56.471
I'’ve heard great things about
you, and I trust Jason.

49:56.471 --> 49:58.517
Oh, I love him.

49:58.517 --> 49:59.518
Exactly.

49:59.518 --> 50:01.128
I committed to Tumi.

50:01.128 --> 50:03.826
The fact that she was held up
in immigration is not her fault.

50:03.826 --> 50:06.220
Captain Jason highly
recommended Tumi,

50:06.220 --> 50:08.527
and said she'’s ready
for a chief stew role.

50:08.527 --> 50:10.355
She'’s focused, she's determined,

50:10.355 --> 50:13.445
and she works really hard,
and she cares.

50:13.445 --> 50:14.924
I know she can do this.

50:14.924 --> 50:17.144
I don'’t know if
you'’ve seen Kyle's CV.

50:17.144 --> 50:18.015
I haven'’t.

50:18.015 --> 50:20.452
Natalya.
She bailed us out.

50:20.452 --> 50:22.062
- She did a great job.
- Okay.

50:22.062 --> 50:23.977
- She'’s a team player.
- Love it.

50:23.977 --> 50:25.544
I think you'’re going
to really like them.

50:25.544 --> 50:27.067
Yay.

50:30.984 --> 50:32.464
Are you actually
on the top bunk?

50:32.464 --> 50:35.032
I hate the bottom bunk.
I hate people'’s feet on my bed.

50:35.032 --> 50:37.077
- Shall I show you your cabin?
- Yes.

50:37.077 --> 50:38.339
Because you'’ve got a big cabin.

50:38.339 --> 50:39.645
Finally, I always
get the small ones.

50:39.645 --> 50:41.125
I know, but you'’re the chief.

50:41.125 --> 50:43.127
Wait, you'’re moving
next door, aren'’t you?

50:43.127 --> 50:44.432
Yeah.

50:44.432 --> 50:45.651
We can talk to
each other through their valves.

50:45.651 --> 50:47.609
- There she is.
- Hi.

50:47.609 --> 50:49.220
- Hello.
- Hi. How are you?

50:49.220 --> 50:50.656
Nice to meet you.

50:50.656 --> 50:52.788
- I'’m Natalya.
- Natalya, Tumi.

50:52.788 --> 50:54.355
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Jack, nice to meet you.

50:54.355 --> 50:55.617
Nice to meet you, Jack.

50:55.617 --> 50:57.141
- Hello.
- Here'’s your cabin.

50:57.141 --> 50:58.229
Hi, how are you?

50:58.229 --> 50:59.839
- I'’m good. I'm Jess.
- Jess?

50:59.839 --> 51:02.450
I'’m worried
about walking on this boat

51:02.450 --> 51:04.670
and being the new kid in town.

51:04.670 --> 51:06.889
There'’s always this self-doubt,

51:06.889 --> 51:08.674
and I guess that'’s when
you'’re really passionate

51:08.674 --> 51:11.329
about something and you really
don'’t want to [bleep] up.

51:11.329 --> 51:12.852
The unknown just sucks.

51:12.852 --> 51:14.593
Natalya'’s going
to show you the boat.

51:14.593 --> 51:16.464
Yeah, I'’ll take you for
a tour top to bottom.

51:16.464 --> 51:17.987
- Amazing.
- Settle in.

51:17.987 --> 51:20.468
- I'’m here whenever.
- I need to go get my bags.

51:20.468 --> 51:21.513
Okay.

51:21.513 --> 51:23.123
That'’s what I need to do.

51:23.123 --> 51:24.385
Do you need help with your bags?

51:24.385 --> 51:26.518
Yes, please.
I'’ve got this huge one.

51:26.518 --> 51:28.128
Where are you just flying from?

51:28.128 --> 51:29.347
Miami.

51:29.347 --> 51:31.349
- Oh, that'’s where I live.
- You do?

51:31.349 --> 51:32.915
- Yes.
- Oh.

51:32.915 --> 51:35.048
Do you live there?
Were you just passing through?

51:35.048 --> 51:36.180
I would never live there.

51:39.096 --> 51:40.314
Settle in and I'’ll be here.

51:40.314 --> 51:41.446
Thank you.

51:41.446 --> 51:43.883
All right, I'’m just
going to change.

51:43.883 --> 51:45.232
What time are we on deck
tomorrow?

51:45.232 --> 51:46.364
I think seven.

51:46.364 --> 51:48.714
This new deckie
is coming tomorrow.

51:48.714 --> 51:49.758
An extra set of hands.

51:49.758 --> 51:51.020
Exactly.

51:51.020 --> 51:53.240
And maybe his name
will be Steve.

51:53.240 --> 51:54.415
Steve Jobs.

51:58.071 --> 52:02.293
- Natalya!
- Hi, girl. Let'’s go.

52:02.293 --> 52:03.685
Have you done any
of the exterior?

52:03.685 --> 52:04.904
No, just interior.

52:04.904 --> 52:06.732
This area is the
least used of the boat.

52:06.732 --> 52:09.735
I'’ve been in the industry for
a really short amount of time.

52:09.735 --> 52:13.782
One thing that scares me is
would the crew respect me?

52:13.782 --> 52:16.437
Yeah, it'’s all set up and ready.

52:16.437 --> 52:18.483
It'’s really important to
set boundaries in the beginning

52:18.483 --> 52:20.746
because that'’s something
I'’ve always had to deal with

52:20.746 --> 52:22.313
in yachting anyway.

52:22.313 --> 52:24.228
Like, you'’re not capable,
or there'’s not a lot

52:24.228 --> 52:25.577
of people like me,
so it'’s like,

52:25.577 --> 52:26.665
how the hell is she here?

52:26.665 --> 52:29.189
So the master, quite nice.

52:29.189 --> 52:32.453
On the other hand,
I met Kyle at the consulate

52:32.453 --> 52:33.759
when I was getting my visa.

52:33.759 --> 52:35.717
And Kyle obviously told me
that he had

52:35.717 --> 52:37.197
his ups and downs with Natalya.

52:37.197 --> 52:39.417
And I don'’t want
to be disrespected,

52:39.417 --> 52:41.158
but I don'’t want
to demand respect.

52:41.158 --> 52:42.985
That'’s where
my struggle comes in.

52:42.985 --> 52:44.639
So, yeah, of course I'’m worried.

52:44.639 --> 52:46.380
I'’ve just got to fabreeze,
all the beds,

52:46.380 --> 52:47.729
all fresh linen on.

52:47.729 --> 52:49.296
Where do these come from?
Why are they yellow?

52:49.296 --> 52:50.776
- Is it from the boat?
- They just from the boat, yeah.

52:50.776 --> 52:52.212
I think it'’s just a match.

52:52.212 --> 52:54.475
Because, like, a lot of
the linen is just yellow.

52:56.477 --> 52:57.739
When is the rest of
the new crew arriving?

52:57.739 --> 52:59.350
Are they coming today, like?

52:59.350 --> 53:01.178
I just know I'’ve got a
deckhand and he'’s a dude.

53:01.178 --> 53:03.484
We do need more testosterone
to balance it out a little bit.

53:03.484 --> 53:06.618
And is this ours,
this sunscreen basket?

53:06.618 --> 53:07.967
Yeah, so I'’ve set them up.

53:07.967 --> 53:10.230
I think it'’s nice
to keep it in there.

53:10.230 --> 53:11.362
I prefer not to.

53:11.362 --> 53:13.146
But then the guests
know it'’s near.

53:13.146 --> 53:14.669
They don'’t think anyone else
has used the lip balm.

53:14.669 --> 53:16.149
They can open it and they can
check that it'’s new.

53:16.149 --> 53:20.458
Okay.

53:20.458 --> 53:22.155
Down here is how
we'’ve been doing service.

53:22.155 --> 53:23.635
So this is all the silverware

53:23.635 --> 53:25.158
we'’ve been using,
breakfast, slushies, dinner.

53:25.158 --> 53:26.986
I just look at it and
I want to cry.

53:26.986 --> 53:28.683
So these are glasses
that we'’re using.

53:28.683 --> 53:30.163
There'’s all along these sides,
there'’s kind of glasses.

53:30.163 --> 53:31.251
There'’s glasses over here.

53:31.251 --> 53:33.732
But I keep all
the tumblers here.

53:33.732 --> 53:35.299
This is a [bleep].

53:35.299 --> 53:37.475
- All good?
- All Gucci.

53:37.475 --> 53:38.693
Bottom bunk, eh?

53:38.693 --> 53:39.868
Ooh.

53:39.868 --> 53:41.479
Talk about gratitude.

53:41.479 --> 53:43.829
First charter was pretty
wild with two people down.

53:43.829 --> 53:46.962
It was really good and the
chef got amazing feedback.

53:46.962 --> 53:48.616
He'’s really good and
he is so chilled.

53:48.616 --> 53:50.096
- So...
- He is?

53:50.096 --> 53:51.358
Yeah, just the communications,
just like the key.

53:51.358 --> 53:53.317
- It'’s charter one, though.
- Yeah.

53:53.317 --> 53:57.582
Yeah. Charter one. But no, he'’s
got so much experience and...

53:57.582 --> 53:58.800
Good.

53:58.800 --> 54:00.846
So what do you think
of the boat?

54:00.846 --> 54:02.064
It'’s interesting.
It'’s cute.

54:02.064 --> 54:03.327
It reminds me of Harry Potter.

54:03.327 --> 54:04.850
The organization'’s
a sh---show.

54:04.850 --> 54:06.199
Excuse me?

54:06.199 --> 54:07.983
Do you mean, like, from,
like, us organizing

54:07.983 --> 54:09.420
or, like, the boat has set up?

54:09.420 --> 54:11.291
- No, the boat itself.
- I was going to be like...

54:11.291 --> 54:12.684
I was like, I think it'’s been
going pretty bloody well.

54:12.684 --> 54:14.338
No, I mean...
I'’m not talking about you.

54:14.338 --> 54:15.774
I'’m talking about the
actual boat itself,

54:15.774 --> 54:17.732
the way that
it'’s naturally being set up,

54:17.732 --> 54:20.300
- it'’s a sh---show.
- I think it'’s amazing.

54:20.300 --> 54:22.389
They'’ve got a service set
on each level,

54:22.389 --> 54:23.869
glassware on each level,
and everything'’s on one level.

54:23.869 --> 54:25.349
Okay, I'’m giving
my opinion, though.

54:25.349 --> 54:26.785
Yeah. I'’m telling you,
that'’s how I feel.

54:26.785 --> 54:27.873
- Yeah.
- We'’ve got them here.

54:27.873 --> 54:29.353
No, don'’t get defensive.

54:29.353 --> 54:31.355
- All I'’m saying is...
- I'’m not getting...

54:31.355 --> 54:32.878
- I'’m saying this naturally.
- I'’ve got my opinion as well.

54:32.878 --> 54:34.967
You'’re getting offended.
I'’m not offending you.

54:34.967 --> 54:36.534
From your part of organizations,

54:36.534 --> 54:38.710
impeccable for what
you'’ve done in a day.

54:38.710 --> 54:40.102
Before you got on this vessel,

54:40.102 --> 54:42.191
the way that it'’s set up
is not necessarily

54:42.191 --> 54:44.237
the way that I would
want to walk onto a boat,

54:44.237 --> 54:45.238
that'’s what I'm saying.

54:45.238 --> 54:47.196
I think, coming on, yeah,

54:47.196 --> 54:48.502
I'’m just telling you
it'’s been great

54:48.502 --> 54:51.113
- for running, obviously,
- I can give my opinion.

54:52.593 --> 54:54.073
Right, I'’m just
saying it'’s lovely

54:54.073 --> 54:55.466
that we'’ve got a set
on each level.

54:55.466 --> 54:57.032
That'’s it. That's done.
That'’s it.

54:57.032 --> 54:59.121
- Don'’t do this with me.
- That'’s it.

54:59.121 --> 55:01.298
Don'’t put your hands up
at me, please. Thank you.
