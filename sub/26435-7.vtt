30:28.960 --> 30:30.792
before it was overrun by sickos.

30:30.880 --> 30:32.029
[Sighs]

30:32.120 --> 30:33.269
In the kid's room, of all places.

30:33.360 --> 30:35.158
Like the kid was gonna miss it.

30:35.240 --> 30:36.435
-[Chuckles]
- W hat?

30:36.560 --> 30:38.358
Oh, so you've been traveling

30:38.480 --> 30:41.393
with a-- a collection of instruments

30:41.480 --> 30:44.598
all this time?

30:44.680 --> 30:46.159
Why?

30:46.280 --> 30:48.954
It's art.

30:49.040 --> 30:50.394
Here we go.

30:50.480 --> 30:52.596
Look, for a very long time,

30:52.680 --> 30:55.399
historians and archeologists
have wondered

30:55.480 --> 30:57.994
how did ancient humans
survive the Neanderthals?

30:58.080 --> 31:00.833
Okay?

31:00.960 --> 31:03.600
How did we defeat them
when they were bigger

31:03.680 --> 31:07.196
and they were smarter
and they were stronger, faster?

31:07.280 --> 31:08.998
They had better tools than us.

31:09.080 --> 31:12.710
So why are we still here and they're not?

31:12.800 --> 31:14.313
[Inhales sharply]

31:14.400 --> 31:16.994
And then they found a cave.

31:17.080 --> 31:19.196
Okay?

31:19.280 --> 31:21.430
And in that cave,

31:21.520 --> 31:24.990
they found a 40,000-year-old flute.

31:25.080 --> 31:27.720
- A flute?
- Yes.

31:27.800 --> 31:30.314
- A flute.
-[Chuckling] Yeah.

31:30.400 --> 31:31.799
And then they realized

31:31.880 --> 31:36.431
that maybe ancient humans
didn't defeat Neanderthal.

31:36.520 --> 31:40.514
Not in the way that we think
of the word "defeat," okay?

31:40.600 --> 31:42.955
They came together
as an answer to defeat.

31:43.040 --> 31:44.633
They sat around a campfire.

31:44.720 --> 31:46.518
They shared their stories with each other

31:46.600 --> 31:48.432
in the form of music.

31:48.520 --> 31:49.874
And paintings.

31:49.960 --> 31:52.429
And-- And they created
a-- a common identity.

31:52.520 --> 31:53.919
And then they, you know,

31:54.000 --> 31:55.638
they-- they built communities,
and they grew.

31:55.720 --> 32:00.032
And-- And then, as they grew,
Neanderthal retreated,

32:00.120 --> 32:03.511
and then, after a while,
they just died out.

32:03.600 --> 32:04.999
So this, yeah.

32:05.080 --> 32:06.229
This. This.

32:06.360 --> 32:07.634
This is the one thing

32:07.720 --> 32:10.280
that separates us from the animals.

32:10.360 --> 32:13.239
For better or for worse,
it brings us together.

32:13.320 --> 32:15.834
And if we're trying to rebuild something,

32:15.920 --> 32:17.354
you can't ignore that.

32:19.560 --> 32:24.270
After everything you've seen and done,

32:24.360 --> 32:28.354
you still believe that's all it'll take?

32:28.440 --> 32:30.477
Yeah.

32:30.560 --> 32:34.076
It's survival of the fittest.

32:34.160 --> 32:38.677
Sharing with each other...

32:38.760 --> 32:43.038
that's part of what makes us stronger.

32:52.520 --> 32:55.831
Michonne: I'll probably reach Alexandria

32:55.920 --> 32:58.309
before you get back to Hilltop,

32:58.400 --> 33:01.870
so if you need any supplies,
you should take them.

33:02.000 --> 33:04.150
Siddiq: I'd rather have the
company, [Chuckling] honestly.

33:04.240 --> 33:06.231
Come with us.
It's the least you could do

33:06.320 --> 33:10.029
after murdering Luke's violin last night.

33:11.120 --> 33:12.519
[Chuckles]

33:12.600 --> 33:14.830
It's for the best.

33:14.920 --> 33:16.718
You know that.

33:16.800 --> 33:20.236
You don't have to worry about Maggie.

33:20.320 --> 33:22.231
We can't take the risk.

33:22.320 --> 33:25.278
I don't know what she'll do
if she sees me.

33:25.360 --> 33:27.749
Michonne, Maggie's gone.

33:27.840 --> 33:30.559
Took Hershel with her.

33:30.640 --> 33:33.109
Jesus runs Hilltop now.

33:35.440 --> 33:37.909
Where is she?

33:38.000 --> 33:39.718
And how do you know?

33:39.800 --> 33:42.155
Michonne.

33:42.240 --> 33:43.435
What is it?

33:43.520 --> 33:45.033
Walkers! Let's move!

33:45.120 --> 33:46.713

33:46.800 --> 33:48.632
Let's go.

33:50.200 --> 33:52.874
Yumiko: Michonne, DJ needs
to give us our weapons.

33:52.960 --> 33:54.314
DJ: Michonne! Yo, hey!

33:54.400 --> 33:56.391
Kelly: How are we supposed to fight?

33:56.480 --> 33:58.437
Michonne!

33:58.520 --> 34:02.036
We need our weapons!

[Growling continues]

34:46.719 --> 34:48.996
- Shit.
- We can't circle up, so we split up.

34:49.080 --> 34:50.831
Luke, you're with Siddiq and DJ.

34:50.920 --> 34:53.150
- The rest of us follow her.
- Okay.

34:53.239 --> 34:55.038

How do you know?

35:54.320 --> 35:59.030
[Growling]

36:01.120 --> 36:03.236
Oh, my God.

36:25.080 --> 36:27.469
[Thumps softly]

36:36.520 --> 36:38.909
Michonne! Let's go!

36:39.000 --> 36:41.389
We have to go.

36:41.480 --> 36:43.232

Good. You?

37:22.000 --> 37:23.149
Good. Real good.

37:23.240 --> 37:28.269
Good.

Michonne: I know what it's like...

37:58.320 --> 38:00.834
to worry about your family.

38:00.920 --> 38:03.992
To carry the burden of protecting them.

38:04.080 --> 38:06.833
To feel guilt when they suffer.

38:06.920 --> 38:09.514
She'll be fine. [Sniffles]

38:09.640 --> 38:10.835
We all Will.

38:10.920 --> 38:14.276
Because you have to be.

38:15.720 --> 38:17.040
I would know.

38:17.120 --> 38:20.272
I just want us to have a home, you know?

38:20.400 --> 38:21.720
Somewhere safe.

38:21.800 --> 38:24.155
You Will.

38:24.280 --> 38:26.920
This is as far as I go.

38:31.160 --> 38:34.232
I should've told you
about Maggie sooner.

38:34.320 --> 38:35.640
I'm sorry.

38:35.720 --> 38:37.279
Where is she?

38:37.360 --> 38:38.953
With Georgie.

38:39.040 --> 38:40.633
Someplace far.

38:40.720 --> 38:43.439
Helping her with some new community.

38:43.520 --> 38:44.874
That's all I know.

38:44.960 --> 38:46.439
Mm.

38:46.520 --> 38:48.431
I wanted to say something sooner,

38:48.520 --> 38:50.431
but I promised someone I wouldn't.

38:50.520 --> 38:52.670
So I didn't.

38:52.760 --> 38:57.231
This means you can
come with us to Hilltop.

38:57.320 --> 38:59.152
You should.

38:59.240 --> 39:00.435
No.

39:00.520 --> 39:02.875
I'm needed back home.

39:02.960 --> 39:05.634
I kept my promise to Judith.

39:05.720 --> 39:09.270
What about Carl?

39:09.360 --> 39:13.752
What about your promise to him?

It's not that simple.

We're headed there now.

We have a message.

39:39.920 --> 39:43.595
We have one of yours, Rosita Espinosa.

39:43.680 --> 39:46.115
She's been injured.

It's been a while, and I'm taller.

41:05.760 --> 41:07.751
Like, bigger. You know?

41:08.840 --> 41:10.990
You're adorable.

He's taken a stubborn interest
in blacksmithing.

Oh. We might be able
to help with that.

41:34.520 --> 41:36.113

And, uh, Eugene's missing.

41:52.640 --> 41:55.553
We're headed out to go find him.

41:55.640 --> 41:58.029
Could use a good tracker.

41:58.160 --> 42:00.390
Yeah. Of course.

42:00.480 --> 42:02.073
- Go.
- Yeah?

Mm-hmm. Then I'm going, too.

- No.
- Mom, but--

42:20.560 --> 42:22.392
I should go out with you guys.

42:26.520 --> 42:29.194
Well, somebody's got to
make this place run.

42:29.280 --> 42:30.873
So I'll stay.

42:30.960 --> 42:33.713

a complaint about a kazoo--
