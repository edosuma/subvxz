WEBVTT

00:06.600 --> 00:07.840
(cheering)

00:07.920 --> 00:10.000
Ex On The Beach is back.

00:10.080 --> 00:11.480
(cheering)

00:11.560 --> 00:13.640
This time it's all-stars.

00:13.720 --> 00:17.240
Old faces return
for another shot at finding love.

00:17.320 --> 00:18.960
Am I looking for love? Yeah.

00:19.040 --> 00:21.760
They'll have to endure their exes...

00:21.840 --> 00:24.480
I've never felt like this
in my life.

00:24.560 --> 00:27.480
...some will have to deal with
old grudges...

00:27.560 --> 00:31.080
Didn't he finger blast you?Had
more dicks than I've had sun beds.

00:31.160 --> 00:35.040
...and as hard as they try to find
their perfect match...

00:35.120 --> 00:37.160
Right, who wants to finger me?

00:37.240 --> 00:40.720
...standing in their way once again
will be the Tablet Of Terror.

00:40.800 --> 00:44.920
(gasps)
This time it's playing dirty.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.640
Does that tablet wanna get smashed?
I'm cacking myself, big time.

00:48.720 --> 00:51.120
It's going to be hotter
than ever before...

00:51.200 --> 00:52.720
I wanna ride her.
(moaning)

00:52.800 --> 00:53.920
Giddy up, Amy.

00:54.640 --> 00:56.640
...as emotions boil over...

00:56.720 --> 01:00.040
You made me realise there's more
to life than what I was doing.

01:00.120 --> 01:01.680
...tensions run high...

01:01.760 --> 01:03.640
are ya, I fucking dare ya!

01:03.720 --> 01:05.080
Let's fucking go, kid.

01:05.160 --> 01:06.880
...and the claws come out.

01:06.960 --> 01:11.280
To your face, which I'm gonna...
(indistinct arguing/shouting)

01:11.360 --> 01:15.320
They're all two-faced bastards.
As always, they'll never know...

01:16.840 --> 01:19.760
She is the most toxic person
I have ever met.

01:25.280 --> 01:27.880
I did not think that
I was gonna feel like this.

01:29.000 --> 01:35.074

01:46.400 --> 01:50.560
The first returning Ex On The Beach
star needs no introduction.

01:51.640 --> 01:53.720
Why am I back?

01:53.800 --> 01:55.600
Because every beach needs a Bear.

01:55.680 --> 01:57.920
(sound effect "roar")

01:58.000 --> 01:59.320
Rarr!

01:59.400 --> 02:03.240
Unlucky-in-love Bear is back
from series three.

02:03.320 --> 02:05.000
After losing Amy,

02:05.080 --> 02:08.360
Megan and finally Vicky,

02:08.440 --> 02:11.440
this time,
he's hoping for a fairy-tale ending.

02:12.760 --> 02:16.120
I'm still waiting to find Goldilocks
to jump in my bed

02:16.200 --> 02:19.800
and have a little roll around.
That's how the story goes, innit?

02:19.880 --> 02:22.240
Come on, girls.

02:23.720 --> 02:25.520
Fear not, Bear, Jess is here

02:25.600 --> 02:28.480
and she's already riding
a massive banana.

02:31.360 --> 02:33.680
After falling over a lot
in series two,

02:33.760 --> 02:37.600
Jess finally fell for her ex,
the roguish Rogan.

02:37.680 --> 02:40.360
Other girls and Rogan,
there's quite a lot of them.

02:41.160 --> 02:42.600
You look fit.
How are you?

02:42.680 --> 02:44.840
All right?
Last time I was here,

02:44.920 --> 02:47.920
Rogan walked all over me
and I looked like a sap...

02:48.000 --> 02:49.800
Wow, you look nice, you look nice.

02:49.880 --> 02:52.000
...but this time, I'm not having it.

02:52.080 --> 02:53.320
Should we kiss?

02:53.400 --> 02:54.640
No.
Why?

02:54.720 --> 02:57.320
I don't kiss strangers.
But I fancy ya.

02:57.400 --> 03:00.560
My game plan with Jess is,
stick it on her straight away.

03:00.640 --> 03:01.800
(laughs)

03:01.880 --> 03:05.440
Looks like Jess needs
emergency assistance.

03:07.280 --> 03:10.800
Luckily, fire fighter Liam's oiled up
and back on the beach.

03:14.800 --> 03:17.800
Liam came looking for love
in series one.

03:17.880 --> 03:20.040
Ugh!
You got shit craic and nae banter.

03:20.120 --> 03:22.640
Shut up.
But the ladies weren't playing ball.

03:22.720 --> 03:25.760
Why are you so moody?
We're making cheese.

03:25.840 --> 03:27.040
Hello.
Jessica?

03:27.120 --> 03:30.440
This time I'm going in as
a new Liam. Bigger, better...

03:30.520 --> 03:31.720
Just watch the tiger.

03:31.800 --> 03:34.760
I'm looking for the four Fs,
fit, fun, flirty

03:34.840 --> 03:36.520
and fucking massive tits.

03:36.600 --> 03:38.240
Your pants say "fuck".

03:38.320 --> 03:40.640
They do. Well noticed.
On your bum.

03:40.720 --> 03:44.280
Is he here for the boys
or is he here for the girls?

03:44.360 --> 03:46.240
Do you want me to fuck ya?
I'll do it.

03:46.320 --> 03:48.920
It shouldn't say "fuck",
should say "fuck off".

03:49.000 --> 03:50.600
You're getting on my nerves.

03:52.240 --> 03:56.360
Maybe the next arrival is more up
your alley, Bear. It's Olivia.

03:59.720 --> 04:02.880
Last series, Olivia
got straight down to action.

04:02.960 --> 04:05.480
She starts fucking playing us
like a flute.

04:05.560 --> 04:07.000
(tune played on flute)

04:07.080 --> 04:11.080
But the music stopped...
Oh, my God.

04:11.160 --> 04:13.720
...when her ex James
arrived on the beach.

04:13.800 --> 04:17.839
Just to see him with another girl
in front of my face, it's horrible.

04:17.920 --> 04:19.200
Yeah, we've got one.

04:19.279 --> 04:20.279
(squealing) Hi.

04:20.360 --> 04:23.040
Is she the one who was
sucking on Scotty T's knob?

04:23.120 --> 04:25.560
Oh, she's game then, ain't she?
Fucking hell.

04:25.640 --> 04:27.160
I hope that won't happen,

04:27.240 --> 04:30.520
but I do wanna find someone
I can have chemistry with again.

04:30.600 --> 04:32.520
But just maybe not so soon.

04:32.600 --> 04:33.960
Oh, my God!

04:34.040 --> 04:36.280
I think Olivia
could be my type of girl.

04:36.360 --> 04:39.040
I might even get a little treat
before bedtime.

04:40.360 --> 04:42.040
Nice to meet you.
Olivia.

04:42.120 --> 04:46.080
Liam's one of the hottest guys
from all the series.

04:46.160 --> 04:47.360
What's it say?
Fuck.

04:47.440 --> 04:49.920
It says fuck on his arsehole.
I love that.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.920
Easy now, Olivia,
or you'll be playing the flute again.

04:53.920 --> 04:56.720
Are you gonna give us a kiss?
(Olivia laughs)

04:56.800 --> 04:59.920
Olivia's fucking game.
She's getting fucking banged.

05:00.960 --> 05:04.400
Charming, Liam, that smile will be
wiped off your face later,

05:04.480 --> 05:06.960
when the exes start piling in

05:07.040 --> 05:10.960
to destroy this happy little
all-star reunion.

05:11.040 --> 05:13.400
Whose ex will be first?

05:20.440 --> 05:24.880
The next all-star is none other than
Gaz from series two.

05:24.960 --> 05:28.440
A Geordie with a big sexual appetite.

05:30.360 --> 05:32.760
Last time, Gaz shared a villa
with Jess,

05:32.840 --> 05:35.720
got jiggy with Anita...
(moaning)

05:35.800 --> 05:37.640
...but it's Charlotte Crosby

05:37.720 --> 05:40.200
who he's been on and off with
ever since.

05:42.080 --> 05:43.400
(laughing/cheering)

05:43.480 --> 05:46.120
I've came here to test me self,
do I wanna be single?

05:46.200 --> 05:48.080
Or do I wanna be in a relationship?

05:48.160 --> 05:49.160
Whoo!

05:49.240 --> 05:52.840
If I get feelings for someone, me
and Charlotte are not meant to be.

05:52.920 --> 05:54.480
Ah, so good to see you.

05:54.560 --> 05:57.800
He's fucked his hair up,
looks like someone's spunked in it.

05:57.880 --> 05:59.640
It looks like a cheese string.

05:59.720 --> 06:01.120
They might be a bit put out,

06:01.200 --> 06:04.160
Gaz is known for top shagger,
he'll steal their thunder.

06:04.240 --> 06:09.080
There's a lot of fit girls gonna
be here. This is gonna be hard.

06:10.440 --> 06:13.640
It's gonna get positively stiff
in a minute, Gaz.

06:13.720 --> 06:16.600
This is Jemma from series three.

06:16.680 --> 06:20.400
She was the first bisexual
to wash up on the beach.

06:20.480 --> 06:21.640
(girls laughing)

06:21.720 --> 06:26.000
But it was TOWIE's bad boy Kirk
who really tore at her heartstrings.

06:27.520 --> 06:31.160
He'll wind up any girl he can
just to get what he wants.

06:31.240 --> 06:32.840
Jemma!

06:32.920 --> 06:36.600
I'm back this time and nothing or
no-one is getting the better of me.

06:36.680 --> 06:39.920
I'm a completely new Jemma,
and blondes have more fun.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.560
Don't run, you'll get black eyes.
Tits are like spaniel's ears,

06:43.640 --> 06:45.240
fucking bouncing all over.

06:45.320 --> 06:48.640
Look who's here.
She's fit, man. Shit!

06:48.720 --> 06:50.360
Look good, Gaz. Working out?

06:50.440 --> 06:55.040
Obviously, Gaz is looking unreal.
Ripped, shredded, the lot.

06:55.120 --> 06:57.440
I don't wanna be part of
Gaz's checklist,

06:57.520 --> 07:00.200
but he has got a charm
and a girl's got needs.

07:01.200 --> 07:03.640
Maybe the next hunk
can satisfy those.

07:04.280 --> 07:08.240
Not him. Him. It's Jordan.

07:08.320 --> 07:11.240
Back to rule the beach
for the third time.

07:13.200 --> 07:17.280
Jordan spent his last two trips
falling in love with Megan.

07:17.360 --> 07:19.600
It's unbreakable.
Like a Rubik's Cube.

07:20.960 --> 07:24.280
And though he proposed...
Of course I'll fucking marry you.

07:24.360 --> 07:28.840
Come on!...the relationship fell
apart like a cheap Christmas toy.

07:31.560 --> 07:33.240
Why have you got a flag?

07:33.320 --> 07:35.280
Cos I'm the fucking king, baby.

07:35.360 --> 07:38.400
I know Welsh people are thick,
but that's embarrassing.

07:38.480 --> 07:40.280
All right, Jess?
All right?

07:40.360 --> 07:43.840
I'm like Henry the Eighth,
my last queen, I gave her the chop.

07:43.920 --> 07:48.600
I'm back, go through as many women
that come my way. Hold tight!

07:48.680 --> 07:51.720
This is the competition
isn't it, for me, innit, really?

07:51.800 --> 07:54.760
But what if you've got no chance
with any of us?(all) Oh!

07:54.840 --> 07:56.080
Don't be horrible.

07:56.160 --> 07:59.080
Bear and me, last time,
we had a bit of a competition on,

07:59.160 --> 08:03.200
I obviously won. He'll lose again.
I'm the champ, he won't beat me.

08:04.720 --> 08:08.200
Well, you can fight over
the last sexy returnee,

08:08.280 --> 08:10.960
it's Chloe from series one.

08:12.120 --> 08:16.000
Last time, Chloe made a big splash
with the boys.

08:16.080 --> 08:19.240
There was a bit of flanter going on
with me, Ash and Marco.

08:19.320 --> 08:22.520
Not with shit stirrer, Liam...
You've had a fucking howler.

08:22.600 --> 08:24.800
...and definitely not with the girls.

08:25.440 --> 08:28.560
She wants to be loved,
and I don't trust her at all.

08:29.680 --> 08:32.360
Hey!
Fucking hell. Jackpot!

08:32.440 --> 08:34.880
Last time,
everyone thought I was a bitch,

08:34.960 --> 08:37.600
and I can't say much has changed
about me.

08:37.679 --> 08:39.760
I'm here to have fun,
do what I want,

08:39.840 --> 08:43.320
maybe teach the girls to stop
getting their hearts broken.

08:43.400 --> 08:45.240
I got you a welcome present, babe.

08:45.320 --> 08:48.120
I like that Chloe,
I think she's pretty sassy.

08:48.200 --> 08:51.240
I don't fancy any of them yet.
Bear's a shit stirrer,

08:51.320 --> 08:54.360
Liam's a shit stirrer,
Gaz hasn't spoken,

08:54.440 --> 08:56.360
and Jordan was engaged last week.

08:56.440 --> 08:57.760
(all) Yay!

08:57.840 --> 09:00.040
Don't get too excited, guys,

09:00.120 --> 09:04.240
there's one nasty all-star
that's still to make an appearance.

09:04.320 --> 09:06.760
Any second now.

09:06.840 --> 09:08.120
(tablet chimes)

09:08.200 --> 09:10.200
(all groan)

09:10.280 --> 09:12.200
I've not missed that fucking thing.

09:12.280 --> 09:14.360
I even named it Tablet of Terror.

09:15.480 --> 09:19.440
(speaking mock Thai)
That's "Welcome, everyone" in Thai.

09:19.520 --> 09:20.800
"They say love hurts,

09:20.880 --> 09:24.760
and it's going to hurt a whole lot
more this time around. Good luck."

09:24.840 --> 09:27.760
(gasps)
It's date time for Gaz and Jess.

09:27.840 --> 09:29.680
(whooping and laughing)

09:29.760 --> 09:31.720
I'm not gonna argue with that.

09:31.800 --> 09:33.800
I know we're gonna have
a great time.

09:33.880 --> 09:35.720
Have fun, guys.

09:35.800 --> 09:38.120
I'm not bothered
Gaz and Jess are on a date.

09:38.200 --> 09:40.600
When he gets back,
I'll make a beeline for him.

09:40.680 --> 09:42.600
Good luck, guys.
Look after her.

09:42.680 --> 09:45.680
While Gaz and Jess take a stroll
down the beach...

09:46.840 --> 09:51.440
...the rest head straight to
their new blingy all-star love nest.

09:53.880 --> 09:56.800
(Liam) Oh, my God! Look at this.

09:56.880 --> 09:59.200
Are you fucking kidding me?
(squeals)

10:01.480 --> 10:04.200
Thailand, we've arrived.

10:04.280 --> 10:06.480
This villa is fucking unbelievable.

10:06.560 --> 10:10.000
If this doesn't make you
wet and horny, nothing else will.

10:10.080 --> 10:12.640
And there's plenty of beds
to get cosy in.

10:12.720 --> 10:15.920
If you can't shag here,
you don't fucking belong here.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.680
Olivia, come and sample
this bed with me?

10:19.360 --> 10:21.000
And if you're really lucky...

10:21.080 --> 10:23.920
Got the penthouse.
...to take it to the next level.

10:25.200 --> 10:26.560
It could be worse.

10:31.800 --> 10:34.560
Who do you think's the fittest?
It's gotta be Chloe.

10:34.640 --> 10:36.200
I think Chloe is, as well.

10:36.280 --> 10:38.600
We're gonna have
who'll win Chloe Goodman?

10:38.680 --> 10:40.960
What? Same again, is it?
Same again.

10:41.040 --> 10:43.920
How could anyone forget their rivalry
over Megan?

10:44.000 --> 10:46.160
Do you believe in
love at first sight?

10:46.240 --> 10:49.280
That's how I feel.
The way she looks at me is magical.

10:49.360 --> 10:52.160
I've picked Jordan, so...
You little shitter.

10:52.240 --> 10:54.280
Get the fuck over it.

10:54.360 --> 10:56.960
I won Megan first,
am I gonna win Chloe again?

10:57.040 --> 10:59.360
But I took her off you, so.

10:59.440 --> 11:02.560
Sloppy seconds, kissed her first.
Well, I shagged her.

11:02.640 --> 11:04.040
I didn't wanna shag her.

11:04.120 --> 11:06.400
I won Megan first
cos I kissed her first,

11:06.480 --> 11:08.520
and I'm gonna win Chloe again.

11:08.600 --> 11:09.920
Oh, Christ, here we go.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.320
Here we go. Let the games begin.

11:16.200 --> 11:18.520
As the fun and games begin
at the villa,

11:18.600 --> 11:23.360
Gaz is testing his resistance
to temptation on his date with Jess.

11:24.440 --> 11:27.560
What happens if Charlotte came?
It's weird with me and her.

11:27.640 --> 11:30.360
We get on so well and we get
to a point, like a fence.

11:30.440 --> 11:34.160
She's like, "I'm scared."
How long do I wait and sit around?"

11:34.240 --> 11:35.960
I don't know what to do any more.

11:36.040 --> 11:39.080
It's nice talking to Jess,
explaining that I'm not here

11:39.160 --> 11:41.000
just to bang as many birds as I can.

11:41.080 --> 11:43.640
I've got things to sort out
with Charlotte,

11:43.720 --> 11:46.960
and I wanna have a bit of fun,
but not as much as I normally do.

11:47.040 --> 11:50.480
I'm not gonna walk back in and go,
"Right, Jemma is flirting,"

11:50.560 --> 11:53.520
I'm not gonna go in and be like,
"Get in my bed."

11:53.600 --> 11:55.640
That's why I was buzzing it was you,

11:55.720 --> 11:59.200
cos I'd rather someone that's kind
of matured a little bit as well.

11:59.280 --> 12:00.960
Yeah, I'm getting on now, Gaz.

12:01.040 --> 12:02.880
I know, I'm 28.
I'm 27.

12:02.960 --> 12:06.520
I know he's, sort of, with Charlotte
and things are a bit awkward,

12:06.600 --> 12:09.000
but I was really happy to
spend time with him.

12:09.080 --> 12:11.240
So, who knows?

12:11.320 --> 12:14.520
Right, here's to growing up
and moving on.

12:14.600 --> 12:16.960
Cheers.Cheers. Shall we neck it?
Go.

12:17.040 --> 12:18.800
Jess is unbelievable,

12:18.880 --> 12:24.520
she's got the best eyes ever, but it
just doesn't feel right, right now.

12:24.600 --> 12:26.320
Let's go back.
Let's do it.

12:26.400 --> 12:29.360
It's the first night in the
Ex On The Beach villa,

12:29.440 --> 12:32.160
and there's only one way
to kick it off.

12:32.240 --> 12:35.400
What better than spin the bottle,
try and spice things up?

12:35.480 --> 12:38.440
So far, so good.
A couple of cheeky smooches.

12:38.520 --> 12:40.720
Jess and Gaz kiss.

12:40.800 --> 12:42.600
I don't kiss people on first days.

12:42.680 --> 12:44.400
(Bear) Oh, my God.

12:47.040 --> 12:50.680
No, I can't kiss someone
straight away.

12:50.760 --> 12:53.240
She is a fun sponge.

12:55.160 --> 12:57.640
Hang on a minute,
that's not the rule.

12:57.720 --> 13:00.240
I don't wanna kiss everybody
straight away,

13:00.320 --> 13:03.080
thanks very much.
Let's play spin the handshake.

13:03.160 --> 13:04.240
That a better game?

13:04.320 --> 13:07.240
It's all we're gonna fucking do
at this rate, innit?

13:07.320 --> 13:10.960
That's my prerogative to choose
if I want to do that or not.

13:11.040 --> 13:13.600
Last time, I got mugged off
by Rogan constantly.

13:13.680 --> 13:17.160
Do I want that again? Kiss someone
and him go and crack on with an ex?

13:17.240 --> 13:18.800
I'm not gonna be that person.

13:18.880 --> 13:21.160
Don't all want to suck someone off
day one.

13:21.240 --> 13:23.000
We ain't saying suck someone off.

13:23.080 --> 13:25.120
If I don't wanna kiss someone
I won't.

13:25.200 --> 13:26.680
Don't be an egg about it!

13:26.760 --> 13:29.000
Liam is more annoying than thrush.

13:29.080 --> 13:31.800
Stop rolling your eyes,
stop rolling your mouth.

13:31.880 --> 13:35.560
Go and sit on a fucking lilo
and sunbathe in the moon.

13:36.360 --> 13:37.880
You're getting on my nerves.

13:37.960 --> 13:39.480
Chill out.
Dickhead.

13:39.560 --> 13:43.800
At first, I liked Liam. He's turned
into an absolute fuck face.

13:43.880 --> 13:45.080
I'm not a fucking slut.

13:45.160 --> 13:47.440
Not everyone wants...
I didn't last time.

13:47.520 --> 13:50.720
Right, exactly. I didn't,
I wasn't a slut last time either.

13:50.800 --> 13:53.880
Argh! Oh, I'm so angry!

13:53.960 --> 13:55.760
Fucking hell.
It's coming!

13:55.840 --> 14:00.200
I'm not gonna lie, right, she didn't
even wanna kiss him with her lips.

14:00.280 --> 14:02.760
I'd have given him a kiss
with my pussy lips.

14:03.840 --> 14:08.360
Looks like Jemma might be game, but
will play-time come to a dramatic end

14:08.440 --> 14:13.600
when the first ex arrives in
T minus 16 hours?

14:15.640 --> 14:17.520
The bottle might've stopped,

14:17.600 --> 14:20.560
but there's something else
that wants to get involved.

14:20.640 --> 14:22.560
(tablet chimes)

14:22.640 --> 14:24.600
Oh, no!

14:24.680 --> 14:26.480
That Tablet of Terror, shit.

14:26.560 --> 14:31.760
"Hello, All-stars. Tonight it's time
for Jemma to choose her date

14:31.840 --> 14:34.640
for a night of fun in the penthouse.
Choose wisely."

14:34.720 --> 14:35.880
Oh!

14:37.440 --> 14:40.600
I can see that little glistening
in Jemma's eye. Shit.

14:40.680 --> 14:44.840
She is ridiculously fit, I wouldn't
think twice before jumping in bed.

14:44.920 --> 14:48.120
She's got the pick of the bunch,
cos no one else wants 'em.

14:48.200 --> 14:50.640
Gaz, would you like to join me?

14:50.720 --> 14:52.280
Oh, fuck.

14:52.360 --> 14:54.640
My plan now has kind of
gone to shit.

14:54.720 --> 14:58.080
I've gotta spend a night with
the horniest bastard in the house.

14:58.160 --> 15:02.160
Bye, guys.
(Olivia) Have fun, guys.Bye-bye.

15:02.240 --> 15:04.640
I knew I was gonna pick Gaz
straight away,

15:04.720 --> 15:07.800
cos I've heard about all this
and he's got charm.

15:07.880 --> 15:10.760
Oi, do you reckon
she'll clean that long pipe?

15:10.840 --> 15:13.040
She wants to crack Gaz,
she'll crack him.

15:13.120 --> 15:15.960
Cos he's been saying to me
on my date that he was, like,

15:16.040 --> 15:18.160
he's changed and how he...
Really?

15:18.240 --> 15:20.200
Maybe he won't. Maybe they won't.

15:23.280 --> 15:25.240
(Gaz) Ha-ha.

15:25.320 --> 15:28.680
Another bottle of champagne.
Oh, we had one bottle.

15:28.760 --> 15:31.320
Ooh!
Don't try and get me drunk, mind.

15:31.400 --> 15:33.920
Why not?
That is my aim, Gaz. Have a seat.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.440
Tonight we're only cuddling.

15:36.520 --> 15:38.240
Yeah, yeah, just a cuddle.

15:41.040 --> 15:44.840
As Gaz tries to resist
the temptation with Jemma,

15:44.920 --> 15:48.680
Bear thinks the time is right
to make his move on Chloe.

15:48.760 --> 15:50.960
I weren't gonna say anything...
Oh.

15:51.040 --> 15:53.640
...then I thought,
"I'm gonna say something."

15:53.720 --> 15:56.760
Because I strike
when the iron's hot.

15:56.840 --> 15:58.600
Chloe, she's playing hard to get,

15:58.680 --> 16:00.720
but she could be
in the treasure chest.

16:00.800 --> 16:01.840
Go on.

16:01.920 --> 16:05.200
She could be in the box,
the box of Bear.

16:05.280 --> 16:08.640
Like, I fancy ya.
OK.

16:08.720 --> 16:12.440
What, was that the shocking news?
That is, that's it. What?

16:12.520 --> 16:15.040
Do you think I believe
all this shit?

16:15.120 --> 16:17.280
Do I look stupid?

16:17.360 --> 16:18.840
Erm... Great chat.

16:20.280 --> 16:22.360
(laughs)

16:22.440 --> 16:25.240
It's, it's bad times,
but I'm gonna pull it back.

16:25.320 --> 16:27.040
I'm gonna pull it back.

16:27.120 --> 16:28.160
(sighs)

16:28.240 --> 16:30.080
Well, that didn't go quite to plan.

16:31.080 --> 16:35.000
Surely Gaz is doing better resisting
the temptations of the flesh.

16:36.240 --> 16:40.200
(Gaz whispering) I should not be
fucking around.(Jemma) I know.

16:40.280 --> 16:41.680
Maybe not.

16:41.760 --> 16:45.920
If you start going under the clothes
and start spitting on my dick,

16:46.000 --> 16:48.840
there's not a lot a guy can do.

16:49.840 --> 16:51.720
(Jemma moaning pleasurably)

16:54.760 --> 16:59.000
(moaning and breathlessness)

17:00.080 --> 17:02.120
Oh, my God.
That escalated quickly.

17:10.560 --> 17:12.680
Me and Olivia necked on yesterday.

17:12.760 --> 17:14.960
The new Liam is fucking working.

17:15.040 --> 17:18.000
I didn't get the shag,
that'll fucking happen tonight.

17:19.960 --> 17:24.880
I ended up sleeping with Jordan last
night. Pissed off mate, pissed off.

17:24.960 --> 17:28.600
Chloe, she fancies me, but she's
playing really hard to get.

17:28.680 --> 17:29.680
Fuck off!

17:29.760 --> 17:34.080
And I do like hard to get, but not
too hard. A day is long enough.

17:34.160 --> 17:36.680
Bear is the most annoying person
I've ever met.

17:36.760 --> 17:39.400
It's like talking to
a fucking five-year-old.

17:39.480 --> 17:43.680
Surprisingly, me and Bear are
forming a bond over Chloe and Jess.

17:43.760 --> 17:45.040
(Chloe) Jess!

17:45.120 --> 17:47.840
They just don't want a piece of us
for some reason.

17:50.240 --> 17:52.120
Fucking bell-end.

17:52.200 --> 17:54.200
I hate boys that think they're lads.

17:54.280 --> 17:57.280
I can't bear it. The last thing
I'm looking for is a lad.

17:57.360 --> 18:00.720
And unfortunately for me,
that's all I've got at the minute.

18:03.920 --> 18:06.600
I basically got with him last night.
Did you?

18:06.680 --> 18:08.840
Absolutely annihilated.

18:08.920 --> 18:11.720
My ex lasts three seconds,
I was with Gaz all night,

18:11.800 --> 18:15.040
and he made me cum eight times,
which has never happened to me.

18:15.840 --> 18:18.480
Technically,
I've done nothing wrong.

18:18.560 --> 18:19.600
I am single.

18:19.680 --> 18:23.680
Last night, to me, was just sex.
I don't like Jemma like that.

18:23.760 --> 18:26.640
So the main test for me is,
if I don't fall for someone,

18:26.720 --> 18:28.800
I know that I wanna be
with Charlotte.

18:28.880 --> 18:31.480
I think he's into you.

18:31.560 --> 18:33.880
Boys like that,
shag them the first night,

18:33.960 --> 18:36.800
they don't stay around.
I don't think he's like that.

18:38.160 --> 18:40.560
(laughs) How naive of you, Olivia.

18:40.640 --> 18:43.520
And all the exes coming in
will want to hold hands,

18:43.600 --> 18:46.720
make friends
and run off into the sunset together.

18:46.800 --> 18:49.920
First ex, T minus four hours.

18:54.960 --> 18:56.360
(tablet chimes)

18:56.440 --> 18:58.480
(all groaning and complaining)

18:58.560 --> 19:00.920
"Hello, everyone.
Don't choke on your food,

19:01.000 --> 19:03.760
but the first ex is almost here."

19:03.840 --> 19:06.200
"Can Chloe..."

19:06.280 --> 19:08.600
Shitting myself.
"...Bear..."

19:08.680 --> 19:12.040
I've got a lot of mad exes
and I've been a bit of a rascal.

19:12.120 --> 19:15.280
"...and Jess..."
Fuck me, this isn't good news.

19:15.360 --> 19:18.200
"...go down the beach to meet him."

19:18.280 --> 19:19.960
Shut up.
I mean "them".

19:20.040 --> 19:22.000
Oh, fucking don't do that to me.

19:22.080 --> 19:25.320
I am praying it's Bear's ex,
cos I'm gonna show these girls

19:25.400 --> 19:28.200
what they're missing out on
when I'm fucking her.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.720
The tablet's got a soft spot too,

19:33.800 --> 19:37.840
and has sent Liam and Olivia
on a hands-on date.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.040
If Liam wants to impress me,

19:41.120 --> 19:43.840
he needs to just make me laugh
and not be cringe.

19:43.920 --> 19:46.360
Sorry about that.
That was, er, it was...

19:46.440 --> 19:49.280
Ever since I've seen
Olivia's peach of an ass,

19:49.360 --> 19:51.200
I was dying to get me hands on it.

19:51.280 --> 19:53.960
Right.
This better be good.

19:54.040 --> 19:56.040
You've got a few knots around here.

19:56.120 --> 19:58.400
How convenient. (giggles)

19:58.480 --> 20:00.680
The massage
was actually pretty decent.

20:00.760 --> 20:04.600
I thought he was gonna be a bit
rubbish, but he's pretty good.

20:04.680 --> 20:06.720
He's really, like, getting in here.

20:07.840 --> 20:10.000
You've got it.
No, not quite yet.

20:10.080 --> 20:14.080
What a date, Olivia's already
dripping like an egg sarnie.

20:14.160 --> 20:16.760
Some fucker
get the "wet floor" signs out.

20:16.840 --> 20:21.040
With poetry like that, Liam,
how could Olivia possibly resist?

20:22.400 --> 20:26.320
For the time being, Liam's great.
We're getting on, he's fun, fit.

20:26.400 --> 20:29.720
But there's something
I'm not quite 100% sure on,

20:29.800 --> 20:32.400
so I'm not gonna put
all my eggs into one basket.

20:32.480 --> 20:34.840
You just never know
who's gonna come in.

20:36.880 --> 20:38.720
Talking of which, the first ex

20:38.800 --> 20:41.560
is about to wash up
on the Beach of Doom.

20:43.560 --> 20:44.840
(Bear) I'm so nervous.

20:44.920 --> 20:47.440
No, you're not.
You don't care who comes out.

20:47.520 --> 20:49.200
You only care about yourself.

20:50.920 --> 20:53.760
I've got a feeling it's a girl
and I hate her.

20:53.840 --> 20:57.040
I think I can handle anything,
until I get to this beach.

20:57.120 --> 20:59.120
How would you feel
about an ex coming?

20:59.200 --> 21:01.840
I hate them all.
Do you still like yours?

21:01.920 --> 21:03.960
I've still got feelings for some...

21:04.040 --> 21:07.360
You have feelings? Shit.
Yeah.

21:07.440 --> 21:10.560
I'm scared and I have got a semi.
Scared, because who it is,

21:10.640 --> 21:15.280
but a semi because I've been
through 'em. Good memories.

21:16.240 --> 21:20.440
I'm questioning my mental stability,
that I decided to come back.

21:20.520 --> 21:23.880
I've had some absolute
rotten turds of exes.

21:23.960 --> 21:27.520
I'd say about 95 per cent of them
are all fully-fledged turds.

21:28.800 --> 21:31.600
I'll make a promise that
whoever comes out of the sea,

21:31.680 --> 21:33.320
we've got each other's backs.

21:33.400 --> 21:36.120
Bear, you are so full of shit.

21:36.200 --> 21:39.560
I've only been here one day
and I've had a bit of a meltdown.

21:39.640 --> 21:42.080
Really hoping that won't
happen again today.

21:43.480 --> 21:45.040
(I think they're coming.)

21:45.120 --> 21:47.280
Stop it.
They're coming.

21:51.040 --> 21:52.600
Oh, for God's sake.

22:05.720 --> 22:07.520
(gasps) Oh, shit.

22:07.600 --> 22:09.120
Hi.

22:12.960 --> 22:14.720
(laughs)
This is Kayleigh.

22:14.800 --> 22:15.800
We know.

22:15.880 --> 22:17.080
Argh!

22:17.160 --> 22:18.520
What's wrong, guys?

22:18.600 --> 22:20.120
I see them both glaring at me.

22:20.200 --> 22:21.520
What's their beef?

22:21.600 --> 22:22.960
Nasty little bitch.

22:29.840 --> 22:31.960
(Kayleigh laughs)
This is Kayleigh.

22:32.040 --> 22:34.520
We had the best night together.

22:34.600 --> 22:38.040
We spun each other round
and it was all night.

22:38.120 --> 22:39.320
I'm happy.

22:40.440 --> 22:44.000
Back in series two,
Kayleigh had a terrible time.

22:44.080 --> 22:46.360
Her ex, Adam, played the field.

22:47.800 --> 22:50.680
Go and hang yourself. Fuck off.

22:50.760 --> 22:54.880
After she hooked up with Ashleigh,
her bessie, Melissa, betrayed her.

22:54.960 --> 22:57.760
You've managed to be
the biggest bitch here.

22:58.880 --> 23:02.520
Now she's back on the beach because
of a one-night stand with Bear.

23:02.600 --> 23:05.000
This time, I'm gonna be the player.

23:05.840 --> 23:08.240
Do you guys know each other?
I know 'em both.

23:08.320 --> 23:10.040
She's fucked all my exes.

23:10.120 --> 23:14.200
I can only think of one.
So she's a bit tapped, ain't she?

23:14.280 --> 23:16.880
How about you, Jess?
She just got quite rude to me.

23:16.960 --> 23:20.240
You think everything's about you.
Kayleigh, you're deluded.

23:20.320 --> 23:22.520
The things you fucking write!
Are you mad?

23:22.600 --> 23:25.280
I'm happy as Larry,
then it got all fucking weird.

23:25.360 --> 23:27.080
The girls started bitching

23:27.160 --> 23:30.760
and I was in the middle
thinking, "I want an orgy."

23:30.840 --> 23:34.000
What do you mean?It's not OK,
the way you talk to people.

23:34.080 --> 23:35.600
Started calling me a psycho.

23:35.680 --> 23:38.280
She's one of them
social media bullies.

23:38.360 --> 23:40.480
No, you are a bit of
a keyboard warrior.

23:40.560 --> 23:43.400
What's your problem?
Last time I saw you, you was fine.

23:43.480 --> 23:45.480
I had it out with you.
Calm down.

23:45.560 --> 23:49.280
Are you joking? You're deluded.
Oh, you're all of this now.

23:49.360 --> 23:51.920
Bear, you don't need to be
on my side, I'm fine.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.120
Got our backs. Wah!

23:54.200 --> 23:56.680
What did Kayleigh do
that was so wrong?

23:56.760 --> 23:58.840
Kayleigh went up to an ex of mine,

23:58.920 --> 24:01.040
and you knew it really
fucking hurt me,

24:01.120 --> 24:03.720
you decided to fucking
go and say shit about me.

24:03.800 --> 24:06.520
I told her things
when she was my friend,

24:06.600 --> 24:09.240
sacred about my past,
I had a shitty upbringing.

24:09.320 --> 24:12.720
She completely betrayed my trust
and basically backstabbed me.

24:12.800 --> 24:16.440
You should be very careful, cos
you haven't got many friends here.

24:16.520 --> 24:18.520
I'm her friend.
Everyone's friend.

24:18.600 --> 24:22.160
None of you cunts were my friends.
Do you think I wanna make friends?

24:22.240 --> 24:24.880
These bitches are jealous.
They see I look sick.

24:24.960 --> 24:26.480
They look shit.

24:26.560 --> 24:27.720
Who's in the villa?

24:27.800 --> 24:32.760
Jemma Lucy, Olivia.
Oh, wow, confetti condom gone wrong.

24:32.840 --> 24:36.800
What the fuck?
Er, come again?

24:39.680 --> 24:42.040
I've never met Jemma Lucy before
in my life,

24:42.120 --> 24:46.320
but she slated me on social media.
Like, she's a tramp.

24:46.400 --> 24:48.240
Why don't you just fuck off?!

24:48.320 --> 24:50.080
Where am I gonna go?

24:50.160 --> 24:54.080
Kayleigh coming in will change the
villa. I don't think I'm gonna stay.

24:54.160 --> 24:57.120
She is the most toxic person
I have ever met.

24:57.200 --> 24:59.160
(tablet chimes)

25:00.040 --> 25:05.160
Come on, then. Here we go.
"Welcome to the beach, Kayleigh.

25:05.240 --> 25:08.640
"After that greeting, it's date time
for you and your ex, Bear."

25:08.720 --> 25:10.080
Oh, thank God.

25:10.160 --> 25:14.040
"This situation calls for
a lesson in cocktail making

25:14.120 --> 25:16.080
to fuel the passions."

25:16.160 --> 25:18.640
I could schmooze her again
to like me,

25:18.720 --> 25:20.600
and I can get some hanky-panky.

25:20.680 --> 25:22.520
(laughs)
See you, girls.

25:22.600 --> 25:25.760
I don't give a fuck about
these bitches. Put me on a date,

25:25.840 --> 25:28.440
and I'll wind them the fuck up
when I get back.

25:28.520 --> 25:30.360
(whoops)
(laughs)

25:30.440 --> 25:34.360
Kayleigh wants to be a wind-up,
but who will be spun into a frenzy

25:34.440 --> 25:39.840
when the next ex sweeps into
the villa with unfinished business?

25:47.240 --> 25:48.840
Oi-oi.

25:48.920 --> 25:50.040
Awful.

25:50.120 --> 25:51.760
Oh, this doesn't sound good.

25:51.840 --> 25:54.120
I'm gonna go home.
It's really bad.

25:54.200 --> 25:56.600
First thing I noticed is
Jess has been crying,

25:56.680 --> 25:59.480
so I know that shit has gone down
and it's serious.

25:59.560 --> 26:02.640
Who is this?
Shit, we didn't tell you. Kayleigh.

26:02.720 --> 26:05.280
She said, "Who's here?"
You said, "Jemma Lucy."

26:05.360 --> 26:08.320
She goes "Dirty tattooed
condom bucket,"

26:08.400 --> 26:12.280
Is she fucking serious?No,
she went, "Saggy tattooed condom."

26:12.360 --> 26:17.040
Why would somebody, such an opinion
on somebody they don't even know,

26:17.120 --> 26:20.600
they haven't even met? Like,
who the fuck do you think you are?

26:20.680 --> 26:23.760
Let's all fucking stick together.
Just, fuck her shit up.

26:23.840 --> 26:26.480
Yeah.
No, do you know what we should do?

26:26.560 --> 26:28.560
Just ignore her, don't speak to her.

26:28.640 --> 26:31.320
Kayleigh, you have no friends.
Zero, none.

26:33.120 --> 26:36.240
As the villa plans
a frosty reception for Kayleigh,

26:36.320 --> 26:39.200
Bear plans to get her juices
flowing again.

26:40.680 --> 26:44.320
It's called a Bearsy surprise.
(laughs)Ready?

26:44.400 --> 26:46.360
Here we go. Hold on, babe.

26:46.440 --> 26:47.640
Oh, yeah!

26:47.720 --> 26:50.960
We're cocktail making and it
looks like it's gonna get messy.

26:51.040 --> 26:52.040
Oh, God!

26:52.120 --> 26:54.680
So, time in the villa so far
has been pretty pony,

26:54.760 --> 26:59.320
now Kayleigh's arrived, I'm gonna
start having a fucking sick time.

26:59.400 --> 27:02.200
I'm not gonna kiss no one
cos I fancy you, all right?

27:02.280 --> 27:05.360
You know I'm the hottest girl.
Hottest girl in the world.

27:05.440 --> 27:07.360
What do you reckon's gonna happen?

27:07.440 --> 27:11.400
Erm, I think they're gonna start
shouting again. Give me a headache.

27:11.480 --> 27:14.320
The game plan tonight is this,
take Kayleigh back,

27:14.400 --> 27:16.800
protect her like a guard.

27:16.880 --> 27:18.320
I've got your back.

27:18.400 --> 27:20.760
Get her into bed,
give her the one-two,

27:20.840 --> 27:23.960
then make her coffee
in the morning. Ta-da.

27:24.040 --> 27:26.920
Let's have a cheers
to sticking together.

27:27.000 --> 27:30.040
So we made a little pact
that he was gonna stick by me,

27:30.120 --> 27:31.280
I would stick by him.

27:32.560 --> 27:36.640
He did add a little bit extra that
he wasn't gonna get with anyone,

27:36.720 --> 27:38.600
but I never made that promise.

27:41.960 --> 27:44.960
All the girls have my back,
I know they'll look out for me,

27:45.040 --> 27:47.400
but I still don't want to be
a part of this.

27:48.400 --> 27:50.880
I don't want anything to do
with Kayleigh.

27:50.960 --> 27:54.600
I can't be around this because
I'm gonna get in some serious shit.

27:55.600 --> 27:59.960
Apparently, shit can be avoided
by moving 20 yards down the patio.

28:02.680 --> 28:04.480
Yo, yo, yo! What's going on?

28:04.560 --> 28:07.440
(sighing)
We're back!

28:07.520 --> 28:08.800
King and queen.

28:08.880 --> 28:12.200
She's there. I don't wanna see her,
cos I'll knock her out.

28:12.280 --> 28:13.400
You all right?

28:13.480 --> 28:16.280
This is Kayleigh.
Where's everyone else?

28:16.360 --> 28:18.000
(Gaz) In the bedroom.

28:18.080 --> 28:20.480
What happened
when everyone was like,

28:20.560 --> 28:23.720
"Fuck her, we'll all ignore her."
That's going well.

28:23.800 --> 28:25.480
Jem, you all right?

28:26.400 --> 28:28.760
I think me and you
need to chat before...

28:28.840 --> 28:30.240
We need a chat about what?

28:30.320 --> 28:32.360
Well, you slated me in Ibiza.

28:32.440 --> 28:34.720
"Discount cunts", you called me.

28:34.800 --> 28:37.200
I didn't, but whoever did
is probably right.

28:37.280 --> 28:41.080
She's come in here giving it all,
"My mate said you said this."

28:41.160 --> 28:44.440
Say it to my face, bitch,
and I'll say it back.

28:44.520 --> 28:47.240
I was like,
"She doesn't even know me."

28:47.320 --> 28:51.640
Massive game of bad Chinese whispers.
"Haven't met you, but you said this."

28:51.720 --> 28:53.040
Well, bitch...

28:53.120 --> 28:56.200
"I heard you said this."
Fucking sit down, have a chat.

28:56.280 --> 28:58.480
We've heard what you've said.

28:58.560 --> 29:00.800
Whatever I've said,
I'd say it to you.

29:00.880 --> 29:02.680
Fucking say it to me then,
what?

29:02.760 --> 29:04.600
You look like a used condom.
Do I?

29:04.680 --> 29:07.800
Why the fuck do I look like a
condom?(shouts indistinctly)

29:09.000 --> 29:12.560
Are you off your head? Do you know
this villa's full of my friends?

29:12.640 --> 29:14.480
Sort your nose out and fuck off.

29:14.560 --> 29:18.000
Your nose, it goes that way,
it's like fucking off to the left.

29:18.080 --> 29:21.200
You look like a pizza face.
Do I? Do I?

29:21.280 --> 29:23.480
I would chuck her
straight in that pool.

29:23.560 --> 29:26.520
Right, Kayleigh, do you
wanna come and speak to me?

29:26.600 --> 29:28.920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Seriously.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.880
I think World War Three
might've erupted.

29:31.960 --> 29:35.400
Why are you calling me a used
condom, and tattooed slaggy shit?

29:35.480 --> 29:36.960
Cos you slated me in Ibiza.

29:37.040 --> 29:41.080
Jemma's going for her.
If someone said you slagged me off,

29:41.160 --> 29:44.160
I would speak to you to your face,
which I'm doing now.

29:44.240 --> 29:46.880
(Jemma and Kayleigh argue)
(Jordan) Stop it! Oi.

29:46.960 --> 29:51.080
Fucking joking me.
Leave it, leave it, leave it.

29:51.160 --> 29:53.840
Fucking joking?
You fucking trash bag.

29:53.920 --> 29:57.320
Stop it, just leave it.
You fucking trash bag!

29:57.400 --> 30:01.240
I've then broke it up and thought,
"Keep Kayleigh on her own."

30:01.320 --> 30:03.520
I'm fucking annoyed,
she grabbed my hair.

30:03.600 --> 30:06.560
The moral, mature thing.
Go for the girl you wanna fuck.

30:06.640 --> 30:10.040
Just chill, sit down now.
Why are you so big? (laughs)

30:10.120 --> 30:12.400
I know you fancy me,
we'll leave it at that.

30:13.400 --> 30:16.000
Jordan saved Kayleigh
from Jemma's grasp,

30:16.080 --> 30:20.040
but who will need extra security
when the next ex arrives

30:20.120 --> 30:23.040
in T minus 16 hours?

30:26.560 --> 30:30.040
After Jemma and Kayleigh get
a warning from the producers,

30:30.120 --> 30:32.960
it's time for everyone to cool down.

30:34.760 --> 30:37.680
It's not nice to come in
and everyone being horrible.

30:37.760 --> 30:39.480
No, I totally agree.
No, no, no.

30:39.560 --> 30:42.680
Would you like to walk into a place
with everyone shouting?

30:42.760 --> 30:46.480
If I'd been slating girls
I'd never met, I'd expect it.

30:46.560 --> 30:50.400
You're right, mate. It's not nice
for someone to walk into a villa.

30:50.480 --> 30:53.720
Liam, like, what are you doing?
Why are you taking her side?

30:53.800 --> 30:58.600
He knows I don't like her.
He has fucked it now.

31:01.080 --> 31:04.720
I tell you what if I fall out
with a friend, it's like, "Bye."

31:04.800 --> 31:09.280
Don't speak, I don't do that.
You hold yourself.

31:09.360 --> 31:11.480
When I'm fired up,
that's what happens.

31:11.560 --> 31:16.360
Your first night, and you're
starting shit. Are you a dickhead?

31:16.440 --> 31:18.520
Tick. Yes, you fucking are.

31:22.040 --> 31:25.360
What's going on with fucking Bear?
Tell me, how did the date go?

31:25.440 --> 31:28.640
Did you kiss him?
I did kiss him, obviously, cos...

31:28.720 --> 31:31.160
Who do you think's fitter?
Me or Bear?

31:31.240 --> 31:33.000
Be honest. Who's fitter?

31:33.080 --> 31:35.600
I am feeling a little bit of Jordan.

31:35.680 --> 31:37.720
(laughs)

31:37.800 --> 31:40.400
You never know,
it could be an eventful night.

31:40.480 --> 31:41.920
(laughs)

31:42.000 --> 31:45.080
If it's Bear, choose Bear.
If you think it's me, it's me.

31:45.160 --> 31:47.360
You've known Bear,
shagged him before,

31:47.440 --> 31:49.440
you ain't fucking seen
what I've got.

31:49.520 --> 31:50.520
(laughs)

31:50.600 --> 31:52.960
I've got Jordan giving her the eyes.

31:53.040 --> 31:56.640
No, mate, it's not on.

31:56.720 --> 31:58.960
You gonna sack Bear off for me?
Oh, my God.

31:59.040 --> 32:01.360
No, I don't sack anyone off, anyway.

32:01.440 --> 32:04.720
Me and Bear have been getting along,
but obviously, until...

32:04.800 --> 32:07.240
You're his ex, so I'm gonna go,

32:07.320 --> 32:09.800
obviously I wanna get on you
to piss him off.

32:09.880 --> 32:11.360
Is that your only reason?

32:11.440 --> 32:14.920
No, you're fit, anyway, you know...
You're fit, I know you're fit.

32:18.760 --> 32:20.920
After an eventful night in the villa,

32:21.000 --> 32:23.600
Kayleigh only has one more question
to answer.

32:24.960 --> 32:27.080
Kayleigh,
you staying in Jordan's bed?

32:27.160 --> 32:28.560
Yeah.
Are ya?

32:28.640 --> 32:31.040
Yeah, we're just
sharing a bed tonight.

32:37.600 --> 32:40.520
Jordan is a shitter!

32:41.840 --> 32:43.240
Shitter!

32:45.640 --> 32:49.320
Tonight is the night.
Chief Smash is finally back.

32:49.400 --> 32:51.920
Welcome to J-Town.

32:52.560 --> 32:55.280
Let's see if he proves himself
to be a man tonight.

32:55.360 --> 32:58.080
If he doesn't,
then I'll just hop beds. (laughs)

33:06.600 --> 33:09.200
I woke up this morning with Jordan.

33:09.280 --> 33:11.520
I didn't touch him,
nothing happened.

33:12.680 --> 33:14.480
He gave me a boner in the back.

33:14.560 --> 33:16.840
And I have to specify the little.

33:17.920 --> 33:21.720
I just wanted to prove to Bear
that I can get the spoon.

33:21.800 --> 33:25.560
It's one-nil Jordan and it will go
two-nil Jordan, three-nil Jordan,

33:25.640 --> 33:27.960
four-nil Jordan,
until Bear's going home.

33:29.440 --> 33:32.360
Shock, horror,
another night of carnage.

33:32.440 --> 33:35.880
There was a lot of shouting,
a lot of crying, a lot of screaming.

33:35.960 --> 33:39.440
I've just woke up and I'd rather
stay in bed. It's gonna be awkward.

33:47.280 --> 33:50.120
I fucking hope that A&E here
isn't too rammed,

33:50.200 --> 33:54.240
cos Kayleigh's gonna be there
every fucking night.

33:56.720 --> 33:58.400
Oh, my God, no.

33:58.480 --> 34:02.840
I'm hoping that tonight we can
get on. If we can't, round two.

34:02.920 --> 34:04.000
Ding-ding!

34:05.760 --> 34:07.600
I fucked it with Kayleigh.

34:07.680 --> 34:11.800
Jordan pops up like a praying mantis
and swoops her away.

34:11.880 --> 34:13.360
I'll get him back.

34:13.440 --> 34:14.639
The plan is this...

34:14.719 --> 34:16.880
Flower. Flower.

34:16.960 --> 34:19.080
Chloe is the fittest bird in here.

34:19.159 --> 34:20.239
Leave it for you.

34:20.320 --> 34:21.679
I'll be nice to her.

34:21.760 --> 34:23.920
I don't care if she
keeps batting me away,

34:24.000 --> 34:28.480
"Go away, Bear, go away!" No, I'm
gonna keep going cos I fancy ya.

34:28.560 --> 34:32.239
Sometimes Bear is funny and most of
the time he's fucking irritating.

34:32.320 --> 34:36.880
When somebody says "no",
it's a fucking no. Leave me alone.

34:36.960 --> 34:38.440
How many more times?

34:39.239 --> 34:41.000
How can I make Chloe be my friend?

34:41.080 --> 34:43.040
She won't be any more.
Ever again?No.

34:43.120 --> 34:44.760
I think I can win her round.
No.

34:44.840 --> 34:46.239
God loves a trier.

34:46.320 --> 34:49.000
But Chloe doesn't love a trier,
so leave her alone.

34:49.880 --> 34:54.520
I genuinely think Bear has got
more chance of meeting the pope

34:54.600 --> 34:56.880
than ever having Chloe Goodman
kiss him.

34:57.960 --> 35:01.560
They might be rolling out the red
carpet at the Vatican for Bear,

35:01.640 --> 35:05.600
but who will need divine intervention
when the next ex arrives,

35:05.680 --> 35:08.120
walking on water?

35:15.360 --> 35:18.560
I can't picture my ex sitting here
and chilling with me.

35:18.640 --> 35:21.720
I just can't picture it.
Cos you don't get on?Yeah.

35:21.800 --> 35:24.680
Oh, that could be fucking anyone
for me, like.

35:24.760 --> 35:27.960
(tablet chimes)
Oh, for fuck's sake!

35:28.040 --> 35:30.880
All I'm thinking is,
"Fuck, am I going to the beach

35:30.960 --> 35:33.680
and yet again
have another shit fucking day?"

35:33.760 --> 35:36.920
"Hello, everyone.
No rest for the wicked."

35:37.000 --> 35:39.960
"The second ex is on their way."
What? Whoa.

35:40.040 --> 35:44.160
"Can Olivia, Jemma and Kayleigh
go down to the beach immediately?"

35:44.240 --> 35:46.600
Fuck, I've only been
in this villa two days

35:46.680 --> 35:49.000
and I've come eight times,
thanks to Gaz.

35:49.080 --> 35:51.120
But that fucking tablet
had to go off.

35:51.200 --> 35:54.640
It's gonna fuck shit up.
Oh, whoa-whoa!

35:54.720 --> 35:56.160
Jemma's kicking off.

35:56.680 --> 35:59.440
Jemma and Kayleigh
have both gone down to the beach,

35:59.520 --> 36:02.640
and I think the forecast for today
is awkward.

36:08.800 --> 36:11.480
You go in the middle,
I'm going away from Kayleigh.

36:11.560 --> 36:14.440
Kayleigh's not the girl
we want to be at the beach with.

36:14.520 --> 36:18.200
If my ex comes out, they'll probably
end up having sex on the beach.

36:18.280 --> 36:19.560
She's a massive whore.

36:20.480 --> 36:22.440
What ex would it be,
if it was yours?

36:22.520 --> 36:24.720
According to you, I've got many.

36:24.800 --> 36:26.560
That's true. That's a fact.

36:26.640 --> 36:29.080
I'm stronger than ever,
so whoever comes out,

36:29.160 --> 36:30.640
throw it at me, I don't care.

36:30.720 --> 36:32.680
If it's your ex, what ex is it?

36:32.760 --> 36:36.320
Hawley, who I was expecting
last time, who didn't turn up.

36:36.400 --> 36:39.560
The worst person that could
possibly come out is Hawley.

36:40.720 --> 36:42.880
He brought a girl
back to his apartment

36:42.960 --> 36:47.000
while I was still in his bed.
You don't fucking do that.

36:47.080 --> 36:48.080
(sniggers)

36:48.160 --> 36:50.280
If he comes here,
I'll end up in prison.

36:51.200 --> 36:53.160
Seriously, fuck.

37:04.560 --> 37:07.520
While the girls wait for
the next unwanted arrival,

37:07.600 --> 37:09.960
the lads are feeling philosophical.

37:10.040 --> 37:11.560
What are we thinking, boys?

37:11.640 --> 37:13.800
It's gonna be a lad, innit?
Yeah.

37:13.880 --> 37:16.320
I don't want another lad to come in,
though.

37:16.400 --> 37:20.040
We need more girls.
I think the lads are struggling.

37:20.120 --> 37:22.640
They get girls in bed
and do nothing.

37:22.720 --> 37:25.520
I'm not even trying,
and I'm getting more action.

37:25.600 --> 37:28.720
To be honest, I think
I'll call it a day with Olivia,

37:28.800 --> 37:30.040
full stop, because...

37:30.120 --> 37:33.040
I mean, you're not...
I'm fucking nowhere.

37:33.120 --> 37:36.840
To be honest, she's got a nice arse,
but she's not fucking that fit.

37:37.920 --> 37:41.040
Hey, Liam, I think she was
already over you, mate.

37:41.120 --> 37:44.440
You should crack on with Kayleigh,
she means nothing to me.

37:44.520 --> 37:46.280
I only did that to annoy Bear.

37:46.360 --> 37:49.640
That's why I didn't try it on.
Too much kicking off.

37:49.720 --> 37:52.280
I probably will crack on
with Kayleigh tonight.

37:52.360 --> 37:54.720
She's fit, she's got
a cracking set of tits,

37:54.800 --> 37:58.520
Olivia, move over.
I'm sliding into Kayleigh's DMs.

38:05.760 --> 38:10.680
Even if it's your ex, I feel sick
for you and I don't really like you.

38:12.080 --> 38:15.320
I have the sickest feeling
in my stomach about today.

38:15.400 --> 38:17.160
How will you react if it is him?

38:17.240 --> 38:20.040
I don't know, babe!
I don't fucking know.

38:20.120 --> 38:22.560
Jemma is shitting herself.

38:22.640 --> 38:26.760
Her ex-boyfriend, I've heard
he's done a lot of horrible things.

38:26.840 --> 38:30.120
I still love him, I hate him
as well, that's the problem.

38:30.200 --> 38:34.760
My feelings towards Hawley are so
extreme, anger, upset, everything.

38:34.840 --> 38:39.520
I have never ever felt like this
in my life. I'm telling you now.

38:39.600 --> 38:43.360
I'll just get my popcorn out
and enjoy the entertainment.

38:47.000 --> 38:48.560
I'm gonna projectile vomit.

39:00.920 --> 39:03.000
What's happening, Jemma?
Oh, my God.

39:06.200 --> 39:09.160
I knew that if Hawley came
I was gonna feel bad,

39:09.240 --> 39:12.560
but not as bad as this.
(crying) I can't deal with it.

39:17.360 --> 39:17.560
