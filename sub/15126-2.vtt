00:01.480 --> 00:04.640
This programme contains
some violent scenes and

00:04.641 --> 00:07.799
scenes which some viewers
may find upsetting.

00:07.800 --> 00:11.479
All you young soldiers,
next week, we shall have cavalry.

00:11.480 --> 00:14.120
Horses which will run
and cannon which will fire!

00:17.480 --> 00:21.359
We at the Manby Emporium,
we never shall rest

00:21.360 --> 00:22.920
to bring you children joy.

00:28.520 --> 00:29.640
Nice and tight now.

00:31.360 --> 00:34.239
They will not deny us
their patent this time.

00:34.240 --> 00:39.000
Oh, no, not for you, my beauty.

00:41.000 --> 00:47.074

00:51.640 --> 00:53.679
Let's see how this one does, eh?

00:55.560 --> 00:56.560
You'll see.

01:01.200 --> 01:03.440
Come on, out me way. Go on, go on.

01:11.520 --> 01:12.880
Wish me luck, boy.

02:50.880 --> 02:54.319
Toymaker. Found this morning
in an alley off the High Road.

02:54.320 --> 02:56.720
Dead man in Whitechapel -
the world chokes on its breakfast.

02:56.721 --> 02:58.359
It is our work, Captain.

02:58.360 --> 03:01.079
It is yours, Reid. Me, I have
other matters to attend to.

03:01.080 --> 03:03.119
Hanging off a tart's tit?

03:03.120 --> 03:05.159
Don't knock it
till you've tried it, Sergeant.

03:05.160 --> 03:07.520
Reid, I'm serious, I'm not...

03:12.800 --> 03:14.000
Reid, what is this?

03:16.080 --> 03:17.479
A 63-year-old man.

03:17.480 --> 03:19.560
Series of wounds and fractures
to the skull and jaw.

03:19.561 --> 03:21.640
No. I mean this.

03:23.160 --> 03:24.320
This is your new dead room.

03:26.960 --> 03:28.319
Now, look here.

03:28.320 --> 03:32.000
Curved indentations to the cheek
and to the forehead.

03:34.800 --> 03:36.719
Belt buckle.

03:36.720 --> 03:38.279
Belt buckl-...

03:38.280 --> 03:40.359
You see,
now this is why I send for you.

03:40.360 --> 03:41.959
What do you mean "mine"?

03:41.960 --> 03:45.800
These are to the specification
you described, is it not?

03:46.840 --> 03:50.680
Now would you look here. Jaw
flattened and the skull stoved in.

03:53.440 --> 03:54.999
Hot water, too.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.879
Your description was very precise.

03:56.880 --> 03:59.320
It may well have been, Reid,
but I was talking about

03:59.321 --> 04:02.240
the John Hopkins in Baltimore,
not a cop shop in East London.

04:06.160 --> 04:08.840
Should we not aspire so high,
you and I?

04:22.079 --> 04:24.360
The mortis is set in.
You'll have to wait to get in there.

04:26.640 --> 04:27.680
This, though...

04:30.440 --> 04:33.000
Drake, a measuring tape.
Ah, drawer, top.

04:35.360 --> 04:39.519
He has a name, this man. It's Manby.

04:39.520 --> 04:42.359
And he has served the good children
of this borough

04:42.360 --> 04:44.439
a sight longer
than you have whored through it.

04:44.440 --> 04:45.920
Thank you, nurse.

04:51.960 --> 04:53.599
It's a small boot. How small?

04:53.600 --> 04:59.880
Small. Mr Reid, sir. The
Vigilance Committee marches on us.

05:05.840 --> 05:10.359
Reid, now, this room, I'm flattered,

05:10.360 --> 05:12.759
but I have made no call
to be deputised.

05:12.760 --> 05:14.999
You would sooner return to your...

05:15.000 --> 05:17.719
in-growing toenails
and hawking snake oil?

05:17.720 --> 05:20.079
Toenails and snake oil
mean bread and whisky.

05:20.080 --> 05:23.439
And how exactly do you intend
to compensate for monies

05:23.440 --> 05:26.200
left unearned, whilst I lead you
from ignorance here?

05:30.360 --> 05:31.240
Reid.

05:45.360 --> 05:50.240
What's this, George Lusk? Finally
decided on applying for uniform?

05:51.360 --> 05:54.440
If matters weren't so grave, I'd
be inclined to enjoy your comedy.

05:55.880 --> 05:56.879
No, Inspector.

05:56.880 --> 06:00.519
The men of Whitechapel do your job
for you once more.

06:06.440 --> 06:11.559
Thomas Gower. The lad what robbed
and killed our toy seller.

06:15.320 --> 06:18.519
The Emergency Patrols
were disbanded three month ago.

06:18.520 --> 06:21.159
You vigilantes were stood down.

06:21.160 --> 06:22.599
On whose say?

06:22.600 --> 06:23.800
It's not for you to tell us

06:23.801 --> 06:26.959
when we may organise,
in defence of our community.

06:26.960 --> 06:28.759
Better still, you thank us...

06:28.760 --> 06:31.679
and consider yourself fortunate
we bring a culprit across to ya.

06:31.680 --> 06:34.599
I consider myself nothing of the
kind when it comes to your presence

06:34.600 --> 06:36.159
in this world, Lusk.

06:36.160 --> 06:39.879
Now, this boy has done what you say,
he will feel my outrage.

06:39.880 --> 06:43.399
But I will not simply take <i>your</i> word
for it. Not you, Lusk.

06:43.400 --> 06:45.678
Your own offences
are as bad as the felons you hunt.

06:45.679 --> 06:46.840
I don't ask you to.

06:49.760 --> 06:51.480
These were found on the boy.

06:52.920 --> 06:55.040
It's got its maker's mark on it.

06:56.480 --> 06:58.759
And I have five witnesses saw him

06:58.760 --> 07:01.999
leave the alleyway not two minutes
before old Manby was come upon.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.560
Names. Sworn statements.

07:10.680 --> 07:12.439
That boy is to feel punishment.

07:12.440 --> 07:17.799
He does not and we will string up
every street Arab in the quarter

07:17.800 --> 07:20.319
from the gaslights of the High Road!

07:24.760 --> 07:26.880
Get up!

07:31.560 --> 07:33.160
Look at me, boy.

07:34.560 --> 07:37.879
There's an army out there
ready to roast you on their spit.

07:37.880 --> 07:38.920
Look at him!

07:40.320 --> 07:43.560
You see how a story emerges here
that fits you for this crime?

07:54.120 --> 07:56.399
I would be wary of this silence.

07:56.400 --> 07:58.479
It may oblige me
to send you to trial.

08:18.200 --> 08:19.760
Quiet in court.

08:20.920 --> 08:23.560
The jury return with their verdict.

08:27.520 --> 08:30.520
Boy's lawyer. Churches with my wife.

08:33.960 --> 08:35.440
All rise!

08:44.480 --> 08:46.520
How do you find the boy?

08:49.480 --> 08:50.839
Guilty, your honour.

08:52.400 --> 08:53.879
That'll teach ya!

08:53.880 --> 08:56.879
My thanks to our jury
for the speedy delivery

08:56.880 --> 08:59.319
of sound verdict.

08:59.320 --> 09:03.679
However, given the boy's
barely comprehensible

09:03.680 --> 09:05.919
and continued silence,

09:05.920 --> 09:07.879
does counsel wish to speak for him

09:07.880 --> 09:10.280
before I pass sentence on his guilt?

09:11.400 --> 09:12.840
My Lord, I do.

09:14.920 --> 09:17.399
This is a child stood here.

09:17.400 --> 09:20.799
I would hope that you might
recognise that as an opportunity

09:20.800 --> 09:24.959
to assert the sanctity of that
childhood and to be merciful.

09:24.960 --> 09:26.999
This boy and the others like him

09:27.000 --> 09:29.599
who we would blame
for the violence on our streets,

09:29.600 --> 09:31.560
it is not they who we should punish,

09:31.561 --> 09:34.879
but the Fagins who stand behind
them, directing that violence.

09:34.880 --> 09:37.079
These innocents, we should protect.

09:37.080 --> 09:40.959
You would urge
an attempt at reformation?

09:40.960 --> 09:42.159
I would.

09:42.160 --> 09:44.880
Reformation be damned, Mr Eagles.

09:46.120 --> 09:49.440
This child,
we shall make an example of him.

09:53.400 --> 09:54.879
No, my Lord, please!

09:54.880 --> 09:57.760
He is 14 years old
and admits nothing of this crime.

09:59.400 --> 10:01.520
Yeah!

10:04.800 --> 10:06.080
Thomas Gower.

10:07.360 --> 10:10.559
Three days hence, you will be taken
to the gallows at Newgate,

10:10.560 --> 10:13.799
where Mr Berry will deliver you

10:13.800 --> 10:16.559
from this life and into the next.

10:27.200 --> 10:28.479
Mrs Manby.

10:28.480 --> 10:32.319
Inspector. I would thank
you for your diligence and speed.

10:32.320 --> 10:35.239
You and Mr Lusk, here.

10:35.240 --> 10:38.039
You serve my husband
and his memory well.

10:38.040 --> 10:39.679
Inspector?

10:39.680 --> 10:42.960
The boy is of tender years.
The sentence...

10:44.280 --> 10:46.039
immoderate or apt?

10:46.040 --> 10:47.959
My duty was to fetch the lad here.

10:47.960 --> 10:50.199
All else is for greater men
than I to settle.

10:50.200 --> 10:52.680
Shame! Shame on you!
You fetch a child to his murder,

10:52.681 --> 10:55.879
wash your hands of him
and call your duty served?

10:55.880 --> 10:57.879
Shame on you! Shame!
Get out of here, Miss.

10:59.320 --> 11:00.920
Justice may not make friends, Reid.

11:00.921 --> 11:02.680
I will not be silent! I will not!

11:03.960 --> 11:06.039
Is the Jewess on your ticket,
is she?

11:06.040 --> 11:08.839
I know her not,
though she is of my mind.

11:08.840 --> 11:11.279
Then shall I ask my Sergeant
to return her,

11:11.280 --> 11:13.479
so I may remind you both
of the facts here?

11:13.480 --> 11:16.959
That this condemned boy was brought
to you beaten blue by his captor?

11:16.960 --> 11:20.479
No, Mr Eagles. That the victim's
belongings were about him,

11:20.480 --> 11:22.460
that five men saw him
depart the scene at some

11:22.461 --> 11:24.439
speed soon after... Though
none saw the act...

11:24.440 --> 11:27.199
that this boy
is no stranger to violence.

11:27.200 --> 11:29.999
And that finally,
when presented with the opportunity,

11:30.000 --> 11:32.319
he even now refuses to deny it.

11:32.320 --> 11:34.999
Lusk and his hamheads have served
an entire hymnal of guilt

11:35.000 --> 11:36.599
and the world has sung from it.

11:36.600 --> 11:39.639
Mr Reid, you are no stranger
to the horrors of our city.

11:39.640 --> 11:41.679
But have they poisoned your heart

11:41.680 --> 11:45.199
so completely that you truly believe
this boy - this boy alone...

11:45.200 --> 11:47.959
capable of the savagery
brought down on that man?

11:47.960 --> 11:51.239
It's finding this boy's master
that will bring true peace

11:51.240 --> 11:52.879
to our streets, Inspector.

11:52.880 --> 11:55.520
I will do what I can still,
but Thomas Gower will hang.

11:56.680 --> 11:59.400
Would you look me in the eye
and say you rest easy with that?

12:25.800 --> 12:27.160
Get out of here. Get out of here!

12:37.600 --> 12:40.319
These young that riot here,
Lusk will use their violence

12:40.320 --> 12:42.040
to justify his place on our streets.

12:42.041 --> 12:44.800
And respect for badge
and uniform suffer further, sir.

12:47.040 --> 12:49.959
Oi!

12:55.680 --> 12:57.240
Oi!

12:59.360 --> 13:01.959
Not so fast now, are ya? Eh?

13:01.960 --> 13:05.119
Wait. This name on your knuckles,
what does that stand for?

13:05.120 --> 13:06.440
Do you know Thomas Gower?

13:06.441 --> 13:09.959
Tom Gower? Of course I do and he'll
never squeal on us, neither!

13:09.960 --> 13:11.279
Aargh!

13:12.680 --> 13:14.000
Vicious little runt!

13:16.000 --> 13:18.478
What do you make of those markings?
What is that?

13:18.479 --> 13:19.720
A brotherhood? A gang?

13:20.880 --> 13:23.999
Been gangs on these streets as long
as there's been horse muck on them.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.399
They're not near
as young and savage as these.

13:26.400 --> 13:28.760
Then their hands
must be guided by another.

13:30.760 --> 13:33.719
I would not tell him so,
but there is something in Mr Eagles'

13:33.720 --> 13:35.440
position I might lean toward.

13:36.480 --> 13:39.239
We are to choke this boy now.
But before we do,

13:39.240 --> 13:42.199
I would have a broader picture
painted as to what and why.

13:42.200 --> 13:45.080
Find Captain Jackson. Bring him
back to the dead room. Tell him...

13:46.360 --> 13:49.400
Tell him I would have a more
intimate study of our fellow, Manby.

14:00.560 --> 14:02.839
Good evening to you.

14:02.840 --> 14:07.200
God sends his confections for the
poor boys what's incarcerated here.

14:14.800 --> 14:16.400
This way, sir.

14:28.120 --> 14:31.839
Now, you tell me should
any other come visit my boy.

14:31.840 --> 14:33.120
I will, sir.

14:42.320 --> 14:43.520
All right, Tom.

14:44.760 --> 14:47.040
You must be strong
in your silence, lad.

15:08.440 --> 15:09.839
Rose, what...

15:09.840 --> 15:11.400
Sergeant Drake bid me wake you.

15:12.520 --> 15:14.599
I've been looking for you all night.

15:14.600 --> 15:18.080
I should have thought to search
the gutters. Where you been?

15:38.080 --> 15:39.399
I don't know.

15:39.400 --> 15:40.400
Get up!

15:52.720 --> 15:54.240
We cannot open it.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.079
Thoughts?

15:58.080 --> 16:00.039
Cigarettes? Vanity case?

16:00.040 --> 16:03.400
Murdered for that
and tuppence ha'penny. No.

16:04.720 --> 16:06.920
We're getting inside there
any time soon?

16:08.160 --> 16:10.559
We must be thorough, I suppose.

16:10.560 --> 16:11.760
Drink this.

16:18.840 --> 16:20.000
What's in that, Reid?

16:20.001 --> 16:22.399
Various. Magnesia for the heartburn.

16:22.400 --> 16:24.079
Rum. Sugar syrup. Cocaine.

16:24.080 --> 16:25.238
Well, thank you.

16:25.239 --> 16:27.080
I'd have you happy
in your workplace.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.279
You have a bite-block, Reid?
I do. I do.

16:34.280 --> 16:35.919
Ratcheted.

16:35.920 --> 16:37.240
Well, look at you.

16:46.280 --> 16:47.439
Huh.

16:47.440 --> 16:49.919
What? What is it?

16:49.920 --> 16:51.200
Take a look for yourself.

16:52.720 --> 16:54.200
His tongue is cut out!

16:55.320 --> 16:57.840
There's more in there
than that, Reid.

17:00.480 --> 17:02.559
Dental restorations.

17:02.560 --> 17:04.599
Gold dental restorations.

17:05.599 --> 17:08.200
We're told the boy's motive
was theft, are we not?

17:09.560 --> 17:12.598
He cuts the man's tongue out,
yet disdains a year's worth

17:12.599 --> 17:14.960
of picked pockets
sat right in his face.

17:16.440 --> 17:18.319
This was no smash and grab.

17:18.319 --> 17:20.358
There is a wider purpose here.

17:20.359 --> 17:21.960
Make good what you have done.

17:23.319 --> 17:24.680
Whatever you say, Reid.

17:33.040 --> 17:35.920
This matter of being dead -
tell me it ain't all bad.

17:41.240 --> 17:43.319
Always been a Manby on this street?

17:43.320 --> 17:45.399
My day, it was her old man.

17:45.400 --> 17:47.799
He didn't want
the shop front changed.

17:47.800 --> 17:49.999
She kept her name,
husband took hers.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.399
Took both daughter
and business for his own.

17:52.400 --> 17:54.039
What do you recall of the father?

17:54.040 --> 17:57.519
Only that he'd see me and my kind
off, if we loitered too near.

17:57.520 --> 17:59.959
A version of Gower's luck
was yours, too?

17:59.960 --> 18:02.759
Well, his ill manner
and ignorance, certainly.

18:02.760 --> 18:04.839
Drew the line at murder, however.

18:04.840 --> 18:08.439
Perhaps the recruiting sergeants
were the saving of you, Bennett.

18:08.440 --> 18:09.680
Perhaps they were, sir.

18:14.360 --> 18:17.439
Early in the day to be disturbing
so recent a widow, Inspector.

18:17.440 --> 18:19.999
Early in the day to have
stopped with her, Lusk.

18:20.000 --> 18:23.239
Should those sewer rats
seek reprisal,

18:23.240 --> 18:25.600
the widow knows she cannot
rely on you for protection.

18:25.601 --> 18:28.560
She can look to us for questions,
however, and provide answers.

18:29.800 --> 18:33.840
Your part in this matter is played,
yet still you investigate?

18:35.040 --> 18:39.319
What questions
would those be, Mr Reid?

18:39.320 --> 18:40.719
Excuse us, Ma'am.

18:40.720 --> 18:43.559
As to what connected
your husband with this child.

18:43.560 --> 18:46.679
Her loved husband's murder
connected them, Reid!

18:46.680 --> 18:48.840
And that boy is under key
and condemned for it.

18:50.080 --> 18:52.600
Mrs Manby,
do you know what these are?

18:53.720 --> 18:55.679
They are patent applications.

18:55.680 --> 18:57.319
Such matters are costly.

18:57.320 --> 19:00.959
They are four pounds for every
filing and there are many.

19:00.960 --> 19:03.399
I'm not sure your profits,
given the volume,

19:03.400 --> 19:05.079
would have stretched sufficiently.

19:05.080 --> 19:07.200
Where do you suppose
he found the wherewithal?

19:08.920 --> 19:11.800
He wouldn't take from
my daddy's till. Not never.

19:13.440 --> 19:14.720
Then, do you see?

19:14.721 --> 19:18.439
I must ask myself from whom
he took the loan of it.

19:18.440 --> 19:21.880
If he'd only speak,
that boy could tell us, I'm sure.

19:53.920 --> 19:57.719
Have you lost
the last of your Scotched brains?

19:57.720 --> 19:59.319
No.

19:59.320 --> 20:01.639
I forensicate myself.

20:01.640 --> 20:03.359
May a woman ask why?

20:03.360 --> 20:05.440
If she swears to serenity.

20:06.920 --> 20:09.599
You wait all morning
to tell me that!

20:09.600 --> 20:11.279
Why would you do that?

20:11.280 --> 20:14.119
Because I knew how you'd react.

20:14.120 --> 20:17.079
I told you when we sailed.
I begged it of you.

20:17.080 --> 20:18.479
Put it in the ocean.

20:18.480 --> 20:21.279
How, now, would you
prefer me to react?

20:21.280 --> 20:23.999
Maybe as if the world
has not, in fact, just ended.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.160
An interested party
gets their hands on that ring,

20:26.161 --> 20:28.839
the end of the world's exactly
what we are looking at, you and I.

20:28.840 --> 20:30.400
Our life here? Finished.

20:40.080 --> 20:42.680
All right, boys,
let's see how we're doing. Jack?

20:46.880 --> 20:49.799
Edmund. You are alive.

20:49.800 --> 20:53.159
You are here so often these days,
I have forgot how you look.

20:53.160 --> 20:55.400
Then you come to remind yourself,
do you?

20:57.720 --> 20:59.440
Wanted a word with Mr Eagles.

21:00.800 --> 21:02.040
Two minutes, Mr Reid.

21:05.240 --> 21:06.840
I should... Emily.

21:08.960 --> 21:12.440
These, er, places,
will ever make me think of you.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.840
The bells clanging,
the faithful falling to their knees.

21:18.880 --> 21:20.839
And you and I at home,

21:20.840 --> 21:23.519
careless of God,
abed in our sweat.

21:23.520 --> 21:25.440
I would have those Sundays back.

21:27.240 --> 21:29.200
Well, we live
in different times now.

21:32.960 --> 21:34.759
Once I had no need of church.

21:34.760 --> 21:38.120
But now - coming here, speaking
with Mr Eagles - I see that I do.

21:39.200 --> 21:42.599
So do you, Edmund, if you'd
only accept that she is dead.

21:42.600 --> 21:45.120
What, Emily?
What have you spoken to him of?

21:48.560 --> 21:51.559
Mr Reid. Should I find you a ladle?

21:51.560 --> 21:53.439
No!

21:53.440 --> 21:54.560
No, Eagles. Not today.

21:55.800 --> 21:58.759
I've a theory I would put to you...

21:58.760 --> 22:00.600
how your boy might
recover his voice.

22:00.601 --> 22:04.359
I believe that tongue was taken
as proof of the death itself.

22:04.360 --> 22:06.959
It was Manby himself
who was the aim of the assault,

22:06.960 --> 22:08.759
not what was on his person.

22:08.760 --> 22:10.919
We have enjoyed welcoming
Mrs Reid at worship

22:10.920 --> 22:13.039
and hope that the comfort
she has found there

22:13.040 --> 22:14.959
might be extended to yourself.

22:14.960 --> 22:17.319
Stay away from my wife, Eagles.
I simply...

22:17.320 --> 22:20.360
Take as fact that God's law
holds no fear for me.

22:32.480 --> 22:33.960
Oh, my God.

22:35.160 --> 22:37.439
They say it is a painless process.

22:37.440 --> 22:40.440
Now, the executioner,
Mr Berry, is a very clever man.

22:41.600 --> 22:43.799
It takes a person's weight
to establish

22:43.800 --> 22:46.080
what length of rope they require.

22:47.640 --> 22:50.079
Too long, they fall too far too fast

22:50.080 --> 22:51.839
and the head comes clean off.

22:51.840 --> 22:55.760
Too short and the neck is strangled,
instead of dislocated.

22:57.320 --> 22:59.240
I say more than they...

23:00.440 --> 23:02.120
There's not much of you, is there?

23:03.320 --> 23:06.760
Wouldn't have thought you'd need
much more than... ten foot.

23:14.160 --> 23:17.879
Now, if it was you that ended
that old man's life, I cannot say.

23:17.880 --> 23:20.000
But this brotherhood you run with...

23:21.120 --> 23:22.719
you make a practice of cutting

23:22.720 --> 23:24.480
men's tongues
from their throats, do you?

23:24.481 --> 23:26.040
What, boy?

23:28.680 --> 23:30.719
It wasn't what he had on him,
was it?

23:30.720 --> 23:32.040
Manby himself was the target.

23:32.041 --> 23:33.840
You must tell us who made him so.

23:35.760 --> 23:37.319
Two days, Thomas.

23:37.320 --> 23:40.079
I will stay beside you
every hour until.

23:40.080 --> 23:42.239
But this end awaits you...

23:42.240 --> 23:44.160
unless you talk to us.

24:47.920 --> 24:49.240
I have you.

24:52.520 --> 24:55.239
What ring is it that you've lost?

24:55.240 --> 24:57.120
Was it the one
you wear about your neck?

24:57.121 --> 25:00.920
I weren't eavesdropping. Promise.
The whole house heard her.

25:02.880 --> 25:04.680
Is it very valuable to you?

25:08.520 --> 25:10.880
It belonged to a man that I knew.

25:11.880 --> 25:13.440
A good friend. A, er...

25:15.000 --> 25:15.840
brother.

25:17.240 --> 25:18.240
Dead now.

25:26.320 --> 25:27.760
Mr Eagles!

25:32.320 --> 25:33.679
Thomas?

25:33.680 --> 25:35.759
Shh! It ain't safe here.

25:35.760 --> 25:37.279
What do you mean?

25:37.280 --> 25:38.640
Please. It ain't.

25:39.640 --> 25:41.480
If you want me
to tell you what I know,

25:41.481 --> 25:44.119
you get that bluebottle
and fetch me out of here.

25:44.120 --> 25:45.400
You understand?

25:46.480 --> 25:50.039
I go to send word. Mr Eagles,
will I go to hell for this?

25:50.040 --> 25:53.479
Your bravery will save you
and all others who serve this man.

25:53.480 --> 25:55.040
I will be back. And soon.

26:10.360 --> 26:11.560
Ready them.

26:25.720 --> 26:26.760
Mr Reid, sir!

26:27.800 --> 26:29.200
From Mr Eagles, sir.

26:33.120 --> 26:36.039
Have a Maria readied
and despatched for Newgate.

26:36.040 --> 26:38.720
Hobbs, you travel with them.
You tell no-one, you keep him hid.

27:32.120 --> 27:33.479
Whoa!

27:40.960 --> 27:43.240
The way's... The way's barricaded.

27:44.240 --> 27:45.919
You, man! Stop!

27:45.920 --> 27:47.160
Wait there, Thomas.

27:48.200 --> 27:50.200
No, Thomas. You're to wait inside.

27:52.600 --> 27:53.960
Thomas Gower!

27:57.040 --> 27:59.440
The love we bear you.
Does that not mean nothing to you?

28:00.560 --> 28:01.760
Squeal, would ya?

28:02.840 --> 28:04.320
Me and your brothers?

28:05.440 --> 28:08.080
You know we cannot
let you live now, Tom.

28:09.200 --> 28:10.519
Hey?

28:10.520 --> 28:12.479
You shall not take him.

28:12.480 --> 28:14.000
You shall not!

28:16.400 --> 28:17.800
Who is this man that stops me?

28:19.360 --> 28:20.920
My name is Patrick Eagles.

28:24.560 --> 28:26.360
You pass through me first.

28:27.880 --> 28:29.319
You, run.

28:29.320 --> 28:30.759
Mr Eagles, no!

28:30.760 --> 28:32.120
Run. Thomas, run!

28:35.040 --> 28:36.599
I'd know your name, sir,

28:36.600 --> 28:37.880
before I crack your skull.

28:38.840 --> 28:40.319
Now, Thomas. Go!

28:40.320 --> 28:41.320
Go on.

28:42.360 --> 28:43.758
I said I'd know your name.

28:43.759 --> 28:46.200
Or do you give it only to
the farm animals you lie with?

29:11.480 --> 29:13.200
Inspector! Inspector!

29:14.960 --> 29:16.160
Inspector Reid!

29:16.161 --> 29:18.679
The streets sing
with rumours of your folly.

29:18.680 --> 29:20.599
Can it be true you've lost him?

29:20.600 --> 29:22.759
Remember, Reid. Boys from gaslights.

29:22.760 --> 29:25.959
Are you here on this earth
to bring me to murder?

29:25.960 --> 29:27.399
You keep the peace!

29:27.400 --> 29:30.679
See how he loses command
of the streets and now of himself?

29:30.680 --> 29:32.119
Get your hands off me!

29:32.120 --> 29:34.040
These children run riot over him.

29:42.080 --> 29:43.800
The lawyer.

29:45.080 --> 29:47.159
Signs signature - belt buckle.

29:47.160 --> 29:48.760
Signs less so.

29:50.480 --> 29:52.199
It's a ring.

29:52.200 --> 29:53.840
Sir.

29:59.840 --> 30:01.160
Look at me, Constable.

30:02.080 --> 30:05.239
It is a fool who joins a fight
he cannot win.

30:05.240 --> 30:08.799
I would far rather have you here,
alive talking to me, than otherwise.

30:08.800 --> 30:11.359
Have you seen this man before?

30:11.360 --> 30:13.399
Some kind of Scouser, I think.

30:13.400 --> 30:14.599
Scouse!?

30:14.600 --> 30:17.520
And he had these tattoos, Sir,
all about his hands.

30:18.840 --> 30:22.480
You know, picture cards. Like the
youth has and a hundred more.

30:23.480 --> 30:28.279
Who is this that brings his way
of life to my streets? A usurer?

30:28.280 --> 30:30.520
Who kills for monies left unpaid,
then gulls and fits

30:30.521 --> 30:32.199
young boys for his own violence.

30:32.200 --> 30:35.039
And now hunts one such,
before he'd tell us what he knows.

30:35.040 --> 30:37.919
Then we must hunt Thomas Gower
also, but faster and smarter.

30:37.920 --> 30:39.559
Hobbs, you go to records.

30:39.560 --> 30:42.599
We need to find somewhere that he
might consider safe, as home.

30:42.600 --> 30:45.359
You search every record and
birth certificate of every family

30:45.360 --> 30:47.479
that might match his name. Yes, sir.

30:47.480 --> 30:48.878
Sergeant, get yourself to Newgate.

30:48.879 --> 30:50.518
My guess is
that ship's sprung a leak.

30:50.519 --> 30:51.840
And I think I know where.

30:59.280 --> 31:02.319
He's your brother.

31:02.320 --> 31:07.560
His world - it starts and ends
in the same place as yours does.

31:09.760 --> 31:11.640
And yet you still can't find him.

31:18.040 --> 31:19.040
Now...

31:20.760 --> 31:22.080
you get back out there,

31:22.081 --> 31:26.040
and you return only should you have
something of value to report.

31:28.800 --> 31:32.480
Gower. Thomas. Years 1872 to '78.

31:35.560 --> 31:37.680
You, there, I want a word with you!

31:47.480 --> 31:50.960
Who is he? Who'd you tell?

31:52.080 --> 31:54.519
Just a man. Like you.

31:54.520 --> 31:56.440
Come to me
with threats and violence.

31:56.441 --> 31:59.040
Name! He never gave it.

32:00.520 --> 32:03.799
Honest. See me for the coward I am.

32:03.800 --> 32:05.120
I'd tell you if I knew.

32:10.000 --> 32:13.239
I don't know why you all care
so much about one boy.

32:13.240 --> 32:14.880
One little Christ-killer.

32:16.920 --> 32:19.279
What d'you call him?

32:19.280 --> 32:22.440
Saw his little prick
when we scrubbed him. He's cut.

32:23.680 --> 32:25.320
It's a Jewboy you fight for.

32:31.880 --> 32:32.920
Well? Nothing, sir.

32:32.921 --> 32:35.999
Keep looking.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.399
Throw out the Gentiles.

32:38.400 --> 32:39.720
Jewish?

32:45.400 --> 32:47.400
Mr Reid, sir.

32:48.560 --> 32:49.560
I have him!

32:54.200 --> 32:55.800
The orphanage off Castlemaine.

33:20.600 --> 33:21.880
I have not seen him

33:21.881 --> 33:24.799
since the day you delivered him
to the hangman.

33:24.800 --> 33:27.759
I don't know why you believe
he would return.

33:27.760 --> 33:30.040
Because he owes his name to you.

33:32.560 --> 33:33.760
An English name.

33:36.120 --> 33:39.959
It was an English world
in which he hoped to survive.

33:39.960 --> 33:41.400
He had none he was born with?

33:42.680 --> 33:43.880
He might have.

33:44.960 --> 33:49.520
The cruelty men found him, trapping
rats for food in a railway yard.

33:50.840 --> 33:53.959
He was eight
and knew no parent to tell him it.

33:53.960 --> 33:55.840
And you became that parent...

33:57.600 --> 33:59.200
that person to whom
he may now turn.

34:01.240 --> 34:02.880
Miss Goren, you will get word to me

34:02.881 --> 34:04.920
should he come to you for refuge,
will you not?

34:06.160 --> 34:07.840
I will, Inspector.

34:11.159 --> 34:12.600
Then I thank you.

34:21.040 --> 34:23.918
She lies. Or she is soon to.

34:23.920 --> 34:25.120
We wait.

34:53.080 --> 34:54.400
No girls. Are you sure?

34:55.760 --> 35:01.199
If there was,
I would have enjoyed one. I checked.

35:01.200 --> 35:03.039
I did not.

35:03.040 --> 35:04.759
Listen to me!

35:04.760 --> 35:06.279
That ring was on his fist

35:06.280 --> 35:08.480
when he beat a man to death with it
only last night.

35:08.481 --> 35:10.759
He's an evil one.

35:10.760 --> 35:12.119
You be wary.

35:12.120 --> 35:14.760
You forget who we are?
What we have done?

36:02.960 --> 36:06.120
Get out! Get out! Don't come
back here, till you have him!

36:22.120 --> 36:24.520
Who is this that intrudes here?

36:25.960 --> 36:28.520
Woman,
how do you know where to find me?

36:31.280 --> 36:32.520
I know many things.

36:32.521 --> 36:35.279
How to make a man rich, for example.

36:35.280 --> 36:37.399
You would serve me well.

36:37.400 --> 36:40.040
Serve you? Indeed.

36:44.520 --> 36:49.039
You make me equity partner
in this here enterprise of yours,

36:49.040 --> 36:50.800
you will feel our benefit.

36:53.560 --> 36:57.400
You're touched or you're drunk...

36:59.640 --> 37:00.840
or you're both.

37:01.920 --> 37:04.159
No, sir, I'm neither.

37:04.160 --> 37:06.159
Imagine...

37:06.160 --> 37:09.319
I bring my girls into your service.

37:09.320 --> 37:11.359
Their, erm, encouragements,

37:11.360 --> 37:14.040
inflame men to greater
exploits at your tables.

37:16.120 --> 37:19.599
Any losses you suffer will be
recouped by way of the pointed

37:19.600 --> 37:22.759
lust your briefly-enriched patrons
exert upon the girls

37:22.760 --> 37:23.920
who've aroused them so.

37:27.760 --> 37:29.320
You are indeed...

37:32.720 --> 37:33.920
a woman.

37:45.240 --> 37:46.560
And you're indeed a man.

37:50.600 --> 37:53.559
Will you show me your tables?

37:53.560 --> 37:54.880
Place a bet?

37:56.120 --> 37:59.120
Perhaps we may rehearse
our intentions a little.

38:43.600 --> 38:46.560
The woman! Stop her! Stop her!

38:58.680 --> 38:59.720
No, stop!

39:03.200 --> 39:05.479
Steal from me, would you?

39:05.480 --> 39:09.079
Let me think of what
I shall take from you in return.

39:09.080 --> 39:11.439
This pretty nose, perhaps?

39:15.760 --> 39:18.200
Drop that. Drop her.

39:20.200 --> 39:22.040
That ring is ours and she's mine.

39:27.400 --> 39:28.600
This I give to you.

39:29.680 --> 39:31.200
That's not enough. Not near.

39:35.720 --> 39:37.560
Well, I guess we're at a pass,
you and me.

39:37.561 --> 39:39.200
We are.

39:42.960 --> 39:45.800
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!

39:46.760 --> 39:50.959
I have more to trade.
I have, erm, information.

39:50.960 --> 39:52.360
Valuable information about...

39:54.960 --> 39:56.760
Thomas Gower.

40:03.400 --> 40:05.240
See, Sergeant, she goes to him.

40:09.920 --> 40:14.279
Thomas, this will always be your
home, but we must find an answer...

40:14.280 --> 40:15.920
The answer may have found you.

40:17.280 --> 40:18.400
You will not take him...

40:18.401 --> 40:20.959
I can keep him safe, Miss Goren.
The street cannot.

40:20.960 --> 40:24.599
How is he called, this Scouse
you hide from? Please... Carmichael.

40:24.600 --> 40:26.558
don't be rough with him,
he's only a boy!

40:26.559 --> 40:28.040
And you collect his debt for him?

40:28.041 --> 40:31.559
Debt, my arse. Then what, Thomas?
What work does he set you to?

40:33.520 --> 40:35.599
It's him!

40:36.681 --> 40:38.199
Upstairs.

40:51.160 --> 40:52.240
Keep him hid.

40:55.960 --> 40:57.240
Come now. Come.

40:57.241 --> 40:59.280
Inspector!

41:04.600 --> 41:05.680
A parlay, sir.

41:09.040 --> 41:11.840
You have nowhere to go!

41:23.600 --> 41:24.960
What is your aim here?

41:27.560 --> 41:30.039
To have my boy
returned where he belong

41:30.040 --> 41:35.119
and then we can all go home,
safe and warm.

41:35.120 --> 41:37.040
If I choose to deny you this?

41:42.120 --> 41:44.640
Do you have children, Inspector?

41:46.400 --> 41:50.439
But if you do not, I pity you.

41:50.440 --> 41:54.920
The love they bear you.
You see this youth here?

41:56.680 --> 41:59.000
No idea what that youth
will do for me, do ya?

42:01.080 --> 42:04.000
Own a grown man's savagery,
for example.

42:05.640 --> 42:09.599
I tell him to tear this place
apart and everybody...

42:09.600 --> 42:13.480
young and old - inside and they'll
do it and they'll thank me.

42:16.560 --> 42:23.040
Now, what manner of atrocity
do you wish to be served here?

42:24.040 --> 42:25.320
Will you give him up or no?

42:30.480 --> 42:31.519
I will not.

42:31.520 --> 42:33.719
His word will send you to the rope.

42:33.720 --> 42:36.520
He is my prisoner
and in my protection.

42:38.520 --> 42:41.720
Then, at the time of my choosing,
Inspector...

42:43.080 --> 42:45.879
we will end you all this night!

42:45.880 --> 42:49.919
There will be nothing left
to indicate who or what

42:49.920 --> 42:51.879
took place here.

42:51.880 --> 42:53.920
It will be my Passover!

42:56.800 --> 42:58.240
And it will be on your head.

43:09.080 --> 43:11.840
These walls and doors
are sturdy enough. We are secure.

43:12.960 --> 43:17.080
They are still not many, cannot stay
outside for ever. All will be well.

43:18.320 --> 43:22.159
Did you hear what the Inspector
said? All will be well.

43:22.160 --> 43:26.599
Perhaps if we ask him nicely,
he may put you to your beds.

43:26.600 --> 43:27.600
What do you think?

43:48.280 --> 43:49.840
Which one is yours?

44:23.680 --> 44:24.720
Head up, lad.

44:25.760 --> 44:27.400
No good ever came from moping.

44:44.560 --> 44:46.040
This one, Mr Lusk.

44:47.480 --> 44:49.040
Thomas Gower.

44:57.680 --> 44:59.519
You. To what end do you bother me?

44:59.520 --> 45:00.959
I bring you news.

45:00.960 --> 45:03.840
Which, if acted on,
will bring you all you seek.

45:10.240 --> 45:13.640
These children? Do you know
where they have come from?

45:14.960 --> 45:16.160
Not all, no.

45:20.480 --> 45:25.839
If a girl, say, was brought to you
and had perhaps lost

45:25.840 --> 45:28.960
the memory of her home and her name,
would you take her in?

45:30.400 --> 45:32.479
I would, yes.

45:32.480 --> 45:34.759
And I would hope that, in time,

45:34.760 --> 45:37.400
her name, her memory,
would return to her.

45:40.720 --> 45:44.719
Men say some are born evil,
others blameless.

45:44.720 --> 45:48.799
The truth, in my experience,
is simpler. They are mirrors...

45:48.800 --> 45:52.039
as evil, or as innocent as
the world that gives life to them.

45:52.040 --> 45:54.080
And this world

45:54.081 --> 45:56.119
- I need not to tell you this, sir
- This world is a wicked one.

45:56.120 --> 45:58.120
Then why, why do you take on
this burden of care?

45:58.121 --> 46:00.279
I am a secular woman, Inspector.

46:00.280 --> 46:03.679
I have seen too much of the truth
of things to be otherwise.

46:03.680 --> 46:06.959
But this of my faith I hold onto...

46:06.960 --> 46:10.400
"Save but one life
and you save the world entire."

46:20.120 --> 46:23.000
What does this stand for, anyway?

46:26.040 --> 46:28.320
I got some of me own, you know.

46:35.480 --> 46:36.799
Came by it in Egypt.

46:36.800 --> 46:38.840
In the army?

46:39.760 --> 46:43.039
Holy man painted it - made
offerings and prayers for me,

46:43.040 --> 46:44.560
in his tent, in the desert.

46:46.320 --> 46:48.200
Said it would let me sleep.

46:49.600 --> 46:50.960
What d'you need 'em for?

46:53.080 --> 46:55.120
Things I kept seeing.

46:56.360 --> 46:58.000
Things I didn't want to see.

47:00.480 --> 47:03.280
Fair dos, then. Your go.

47:08.760 --> 47:10.680
Pictures mean different things.

47:12.520 --> 47:14.119
King's a mugging,

47:14.120 --> 47:15.520
Knave's a house-break.

47:25.200 --> 47:26.480
No Queens?

47:27.760 --> 47:29.079
Queen's a rape.

47:29.080 --> 47:31.680
And Manby? Which is he?

47:53.000 --> 47:55.599
We ain't supposed
to take none their belongings.

47:55.600 --> 47:57.320
Save for their tongues.

47:58.560 --> 47:59.520
Save that.

48:18.080 --> 48:22.839
He was ruining her. His inventions
and his patent applications.

48:22.840 --> 48:25.639
Had his hands
in her Daddy's till, after all.

48:25.640 --> 48:28.079
It wasn't a debt
you were collecting, was it?

48:28.080 --> 48:32.919
Carmichael is paid
to have men killed... correct?

48:32.920 --> 48:35.679
And he instructs you
in the killing of them.

48:35.680 --> 48:38.400
Their tongue cut clean to prove it.

48:43.440 --> 48:46.480
The wife paid.
All I knew, she wanted him gone.

49:05.960 --> 49:09.320
Out of your beds! Out of your beds!
Get in the corner!

49:15.160 --> 49:16.760
Down. Down.

49:18.280 --> 49:19.680
Sergeant. Oi!

49:33.280 --> 49:34.360
At them!

49:35.440 --> 49:36.880
Get at them!

49:48.680 --> 49:49.719
Inspector!

49:49.720 --> 49:50.919
How about it?

49:50.920 --> 49:52.200
Me and you?

50:34.280 --> 50:36.280
Woman, you are dead!

50:40.280 --> 50:41.799
Oi, Liverpool!

50:41.800 --> 50:43.880
Stand aside for the Vigilance Men.

50:49.040 --> 50:50.400
Thomas Gower?!

50:53.560 --> 50:55.400
Where are you, boy?

50:59.560 --> 51:01.160
It's time you came home, lad.

51:24.000 --> 51:26.080
Grab 'em. Quick!

51:37.560 --> 51:39.599
I'll take that boy, now...

51:39.600 --> 51:41.920
as recompense for my actions here.

51:44.080 --> 51:46.920
And I will tell you
what I told this man...

51:47.920 --> 51:50.360
that he is my prisoner
and in my protection.

51:55.080 --> 51:59.240
You think yourself above the law,
you'd best start acting as such.

52:09.880 --> 52:11.200
Come on, out!

52:16.480 --> 52:18.960
Now, whatever has passed here,
whatever we say of you,

52:18.961 --> 52:21.080
that you were Carmichael's
creature in all of this.

52:21.081 --> 52:23.199
We cannot be certain
the courts will agree.

52:23.200 --> 52:24.800
You get him away. Far away.

52:26.360 --> 52:27.520
Go with him, Thomas.

52:48.160 --> 52:51.760
Thank you, sir,
he'll make a great little soldier.

52:59.160 --> 53:02.160
His name's Sergeant Randall
and you do as he says.

53:03.160 --> 53:05.119
Now, I've told him you are 18.

53:05.120 --> 53:07.480
The ship leaves
Gravesend in the morning.

53:08.600 --> 53:10.159
You're saving me?

53:10.160 --> 53:12.919
No. I do no such thing.

53:12.920 --> 53:17.359
Where you go to, all you've
yet known will seem no more

53:17.360 --> 53:19.080
than a Sunday fair.

53:23.480 --> 53:24.520
Here.

53:35.080 --> 53:36.519
In you get, lad.

53:36.520 --> 53:37.560
Look sharp.

53:42.720 --> 53:44.080
Carmichael's ring.

53:47.000 --> 53:48.960
So I see.

53:51.840 --> 53:53.919
And what perplexes me...

53:53.920 --> 53:57.319
is that two years previous,
there was a wire

53:57.320 --> 53:59.840
from your Pinkerton brothers
in Chicago.

54:01.200 --> 54:05.159
The name sent to the
constabularies of the known world...

54:05.160 --> 54:08.079
"Search for a man, alive or dead,"

54:08.080 --> 54:10.839
and if you look here...

54:10.840 --> 54:15.400
engraved in the inner
is the very same name...

54:17.320 --> 54:18.640
Matthew Judge.

54:22.400 --> 54:23.479
Tell me,

54:23.480 --> 54:27.400
did you chance upon that name during
your time with the Pinkertons?

54:30.000 --> 54:31.000
No.

54:31.960 --> 54:34.560
No, Reid.
I can't really say that I have.

54:36.920 --> 54:40.040
I thought it worth asking.
Always worth that.

54:43.080 --> 54:45.120
A sergeant's rate. Computed daily.

54:48.400 --> 54:51.440
What I shall pay you
for your services. Does it wash?

54:54.680 --> 54:59.839
Do not dicker with me, Captain.
You are of great service to me.

54:59.840 --> 55:02.119
You have saved souls
this past night.

55:02.120 --> 55:05.799
But... do not think my curiosity,
as to how you knew I needed such,

55:05.800 --> 55:07.280
is easily put to bed.

55:09.960 --> 55:11.640
Well, then, it washes.

55:18.480 --> 55:19.760
Did you return that wire?

55:21.560 --> 55:25.399
From the Pinks. Oh, I did. I did.

55:25.400 --> 55:29.239
Told them the ring was recovered
from a murderous kidsman.

55:29.240 --> 55:32.520
And that if their Matthew Judge
was anything, he was dead.

55:51.320 --> 55:57.320
You! I will haunt you
and drag you to hell with me!

55:59.600 --> 56:01.480
Go home, Sergeant.

56:04.680 --> 56:06.040
Thank you, sir.

56:42.560 --> 56:43.960
You pray for Mr Eagles.

56:46.520 --> 56:50.439
It is a waste... A terrible waste.

56:50.440 --> 56:51.440
It is not.

56:53.000 --> 56:54.999
A child breathes
that would not have.

56:55.000 --> 56:58.040
Had Mr Eagles lived, many more
would have come to thank him.

57:00.760 --> 57:04.360
"Whoever saves one life,
saves the world entire."

57:09.480 --> 57:12.680
It is from the Talmud, I believe.

57:21.440 --> 57:25.600
Emily, I know what you told Mr Eagles.
You had no business doing so.

57:27.560 --> 57:29.040
What am I to do, Edmund?

57:31.880 --> 57:32.880
I mourn her.

57:34.600 --> 57:37.960
And because you will not,
I must do so alone.

57:39.640 --> 57:41.879
Mr Eagles was kind to me.

57:41.880 --> 57:44.360
He allowed me to speak of her.

57:46.400 --> 57:48.079
To imagine her in heaven.

57:48.080 --> 57:52.040
To imagine a life...
beyond this pain.

57:54.720 --> 57:57.200
Would you deny me that?
I would take your pain.

57:58.240 --> 58:00.760
I would amplify it a
hundredfold and bear it

58:00.761 --> 58:03.279
for you every day of
what remains of my life.

58:03.280 --> 58:06.640
But... I cannot do what you ask.

58:14.560 --> 58:17.519
You listen to me. You stay with me.

58:17.520 --> 58:19.000
You stay alive. Stay alive.

58:19.001 --> 58:20.599
You live.

58:20.600 --> 58:22.639
You stay with me.

58:22.640 --> 58:23.800
Please.

58:27.040 --> 58:28.920
I will do anything.
