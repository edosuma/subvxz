01:49.776 --> 01:52.112
- Today, you'll have to

01:52.112 --> 01:55.240

01:55.240 --> 01:57.284
You will have three hours

handles to your blades

fully functional weapons

02:15.469 --> 02:18.513

for strength and durability

02:18.513 --> 02:22.309

04:26.850 --> 04:28.685
If they've been coated,

05:47.597 --> 05:49.558
I'm not cutting

Damascus and, you know,

05:51.268 --> 05:52.769
the whole thing

05:52.769 --> 05:54.646

you wanna get the can off.

05:54.646 --> 05:56.857
But if you're trying to make
a knife in three hours,

05:56.857 --> 05:59.651
you're only really required to
take it away from the very edge

05:59.651 --> 06:01.069

<i>motorcycle handlebars,</i>

<i>which is extremely tough.</i>

06:15.458 --> 06:17.127
I need to make a thick,
heavy blade

06:17.127 --> 06:19.254
<i>that can take that abuse.</i>

06:19.254 --> 06:20.755
- Remember,
he's got the springs,

06:20.755 --> 06:22.215
so he's got a lot
more voids in there

06:22.215 --> 06:24.342
than the chain's gonna do.

06:24.342 --> 06:27.095
We really need to fold it a
few times to get all that out.

06:27.095 --> 06:29.139
When you have time,
it's not an issue.

06:29.139 --> 06:31.808

<i>until I get there.</i>

06:47.157 --> 06:50.660

<i>making me happy.</i>

06:53.622 --> 06:55.290

07:05.967 --> 07:08.345
that's gonna give me
high-carbon steel.

- So, Ed has abandoned
it looks like the rotor

07:10.847 --> 07:12.390

to the chain there.

I have no experience

It takes a lot of time.

08:16.079 --> 08:18.415

moving some steel over here.

Like, he left the can on,

I am looking at solid steel

08:32.470 --> 08:35.348
I'm getting a little
more confident now.

08:37.600 --> 08:40.311

steel of canister.

08:40.311 --> 08:42.731

the can off already.

09:27.195 --> 09:28.780

- Very nice.

09:28.780 --> 09:30.073

<i>All I gotta do is run down</i>

09:42.502 --> 09:45.463
And I'm noticing these bits

09:45.463 --> 09:48.758
<i>were square tubings</i>
<i>stuck to the sides.</i>

09:48.758 --> 09:50.927
They're that inner core

09:50.927 --> 09:53.096
- Look at Ed's steel right now.
Tiny.

09:53.096 --> 09:55.473
- He drew that all out
into that long billet.

09:55.473 --> 09:57.183
Then removed the can.

09:57.183 --> 09:58.601

the narrow-y thing?

09:58.601 --> 10:00.436

60 minutes remaining

So, I've gotta come up

10:10.029 --> 10:12.949

10:12.949 --> 10:14.701
- He's going for the
other part of that disc.

10:14.701 --> 10:15.993
- Looks like
he's starting from scratch.

10:15.993 --> 10:18.287
- Oh.
- Wow.

10:18.287 --> 10:20.707
Well, misery loves company.

10:20.707 --> 10:23.710
<i>- So, I start drawing out</i>
<i>my blade shape.</i>

10:23.710 --> 10:26.379
<i>And I'm actually making up</i>
<i>some of the time I lost.</i>

10:26.379 --> 10:30.341

piece of steel very quickly.

10:30.341 --> 10:31.718
<i>- I look down, and that</i>
<i>knife doesn't look like</i>

10:31.718 --> 10:34.053

<i>And I don't know if it'll</i>
<i>actually harden at the quench.</i>

10:37.098 --> 10:39.267
- I'm feeling pretty
good about this knife,

10:39.267 --> 10:41.436
but I know I still got this
critical thing I gotta do

10:41.436 --> 10:44.063
<i>and that's to quench it.</i>

10:44.063 --> 10:46.357
Immediately. File check it.

<i>This blade's hard enough.</i>

10:48.276 --> 10:50.653
About as good

10:50.653 --> 10:52.905
- Ay-yi-yi, what a mess.

I don't have anything
I can work with here.

Ed has abandoned his steel,

11:03.374 --> 11:05.501
grabbed that last chunk
of brake rotor,

11:05.501 --> 11:07.837

11:19.474 --> 11:20.933

11:20.933 --> 11:22.685
<i>[tense music]</i>

11:22.685 --> 11:24.687

- Nope.

11:26.355 --> 11:28.107
- It's not even
close to being hard.

11:28.107 --> 11:30.109
<i>I'm gonna risk doing</i>
<i>the water quench.</i>

11:30.109 --> 11:32.445
<i>Quenching in water</i>
<i>is a lot more risky.</i>

11:32.445 --> 11:34.781
It cools the blade down
a lot faster.

11:34.781 --> 11:37.408
<i>And when you do that,</i>
<i>it causes cracks.</i>

11:37.408 --> 11:38.868
- Is Jordan in the water
over there?

11:38.868 --> 11:40.244
- He's in the water.

11:40.244 --> 11:41.746

11:41.746 --> 11:43.831
<i>- It's still dead soft.</i>

11:43.831 --> 11:45.249
- It's as hard

11:45.249 --> 11:46.876
- Just let it be.
- Don't do it--oh.

11:46.876 --> 11:48.961
- Jordan's back in the forge.
Three minutes.

11:48.961 --> 11:50.880
They have three minutes
left on the clock.

11:50.880 --> 11:53.132
It's ice cold and he's got
three minutes to warm it up.

11:53.132 --> 11:55.259
We only have
one quenched blade.

11:55.259 --> 11:56.803
- If the smith doesn't turn in
a quenched and hardened blade,

11:56.803 --> 11:58.054
he's going home.

11:58.054 --> 11:59.347
