I wanna express, first,
my total outrage that, at this hour...

01:53.697 --> 01:56.533
the city of New York
is still without power.

01:59.620 --> 02:03.165
<i>In eight weeks, when you</i>
<i>go to the polls to choose a mayor,</i>

02:03.248 --> 02:04.875
<i>tell Beame to take a hike.</i>

02:04.958 --> 02:08.336
<i>New York, we have a right to express</i>
<i>our moral outrage.</i>

02:08.419 --> 02:11.006
You're outraged, aren't you, ma'am?
You're outraged.

02:11.089 --> 02:15.677
You should be. And if you're not, frankly,
you might wanna have your head examined.

02:16.345 --> 02:22.392
The city we love has become
a dangerous, dirty and lawless place.

02:22.476 --> 02:24.019
This is a city with a mayor

02:24.102 --> 02:28.523
<i>who lets teenage graffiti vandals</i>
<i>walk all over him.</i>

02:28.607 --> 02:32.402
Stop giving these hoodlums
slaps on the wrists. Arrest them.

02:32.944 --> 02:36.198
And let them do their art
from behind bars.

02:36.406 --> 02:37.866
That's right, folks.

02:37.949 --> 02:41.703
- Tough times require tough leadership.
- Yes.

02:41.787 --> 02:44.122
On September 8th...

02:44.206 --> 02:46.625
vote Ed Koch for mayor.

02:46.708 --> 02:49.211
- And let's take our city back. Thank you.
- That's right.

02:49.294 --> 02:50.837
Thank you. Get to work safely.

02:50.921 --> 02:53.799
I don't know how you're gonna get there,
but get to work.

02:53.882 --> 02:56.718
<i>- Who you gonna vote for? Ed Koch, right?</i>

Anybody in need of shelter,
please proceed to the basement.

03:10.315 --> 03:13.860
If you're needing medical attention,
we have Señor Rivera here.

03:13.944 --> 03:15.904
Finally, anybody who needs food or water,

03:15.987 --> 03:19.032

<i>Levanta la mano, nena.</i>

Patience, please.
We'll get through this. <i>Gracias</i>.

03:24.287 --> 03:26.540
When my parents get back from upstate,

03:26.623 --> 03:28.583
my brothers wanna tell them
the salon got looted.

03:28.667 --> 03:30.961
It's messed up,
but I think I might go with it.

03:31.044 --> 03:33.380
You for sure not gonna tell them
about the party.

03:33.463 --> 03:36.842
I think it's crazy, the way people
be stealing the way they do.

03:36.925 --> 03:39.594
No, it ain't. Lots of people around here
ain't got nothing.

03:39.678 --> 03:43.223
Nobody cares if we fucking struggling.
I mean, besides your <i>tío</i>.

03:43.306 --> 03:44.141

<i>- Gracias.</i>

03:44.224 --> 03:46.226

03:46.309 --> 03:47.561
Hello, Mr. Carleno.

03:47.644 --> 03:51.106
- At least someone had a good night.
- Shit. How'd it go at the studio?

03:51.189 --> 03:53.942
We didn't get to record
because of the blackout,

03:54.025 --> 03:55.736
but I think I really impressed Jackie

03:55.819 --> 03:57.696
because he wants to write me
a whole new song.

03:57.779 --> 04:00.073
Hold up. You're gonna be famous.

04:00.157 --> 04:01.742
She's gonna be famous.

04:01.825 --> 04:04.119
And tell her what else.

04:04.202 --> 04:06.204
Okay.

04:06.288 --> 04:07.789
- I had sex.
- With who?

04:08.582 --> 04:09.708
Ezekiel.

04:09.791 --> 04:10.709
You fucked Ezekiel?

04:10.792 --> 04:12.085
-Shut up.
-Who else she fuck?

04:12.169 --> 04:15.964
And besides... they made love.

04:16.047 --> 04:18.091
My God.

04:18.175 --> 04:21.636
-Our little church girl is a woman.
-Shut up.

04:21.720 --> 04:24.055
Boss, Stanley Kelly called.

04:24.139 --> 04:26.391
Urgent message from Mayor Beame.

04:26.475 --> 04:29.227
-Something good, I hope.
-He didn't say.

04:29.936 --> 04:33.940
All right. Tell him to meet us
at Charlotte Street like in an hour.

It's time to pick up where we left off.

06:12.622 --> 06:13.832
Yo, we gotta tell Shao.

06:13.915 --> 06:15.542
We ain't telling him about that tape.

06:19.754 --> 06:23.800
Are you absolutely, positively sure
it was Shao and his crew?

06:23.883 --> 06:24.884
It was them.

06:25.510 --> 06:28.763
They was perpetrating your secret cuts
like it was being spun by them.

06:28.847 --> 06:30.473
They had a fake rig set up.

06:30.557 --> 06:33.268
Pretending to scratch and spin,
charging at the door.

06:33.351 --> 06:34.603
Fools was falling for it, too.

06:34.686 --> 06:36.438
It was straight up blasphemy, son.
Word up.

06:36.521 --> 06:40.108
-You think Shao made this tape?
-No. They got it from a store.

06:40.191 --> 06:43.486
We went to the spot, store guy
just said he got it from somebody black.

06:43.570 --> 06:44.696
"Somebody black." All right.

06:44.779 --> 06:47.824
I need you to find me
that bootlegger today.

06:47.907 --> 06:51.244
Look, man... No offense,
but we ain't got time for that.

06:51.328 --> 06:52.996

No. No, you don't get it.

06:54.998 --> 06:57.709
Y'all get paid 'cause I put on shows.

06:57.792 --> 07:01.338
Now if anybody can buy
a fucking bootleg of my show then...

07:01.963 --> 07:03.965
they don't need to pay
no admission no more.

07:04.049 --> 07:05.634
Or come to no show.

07:05.717 --> 07:09.387
Now, find me that bootlegger,
or y'all can go fuck yourselves.

07:14.768 --> 07:16.853
They call themselves
the Get Down Brothers,

07:16.937 --> 07:18.355
or something stupid.

07:18.438 --> 07:21.858
And like, Zeke, he was raised right, <i>tío</i>.
Now his friend, Shaolin--

07:21.942 --> 07:24.152
-That's the leader, right?
<i>-Sí,</i> but he's a <i>cafre</i>.

07:24.235 --> 07:26.696
He is a bad influence, Mr. Fuerte.

07:26.780 --> 07:31.576
But this kid, Ezekiel, he's the one that
used to play the piano in the church.

07:31.660 --> 07:34.120
<i>-Sí.</i>
-The skinny quiet one with the...

07:35.538 --> 07:37.958
-You like him?
<i>-Sí.</i>

07:38.625 --> 07:40.710
-I mean like that?
-No.

07:41.419 --> 07:43.588
I don't know. Maybe.

07:43.672 --> 07:45.924
He'd never try to lay a finger on you,
right? 'Cause--

07:46.007 --> 07:49.135
No,<i> Tío, claro, claro.</i>
No, he-- He got manners.

07:49.928 --> 07:51.221
Let's keep it that way?

07:52.222 --> 07:53.932
But he's smart, too.

07:54.015 --> 07:56.226
You know Ms. Green, right?

07:56.309 --> 07:57.644
She thinks he's gifted.

07:57.769 --> 07:59.729
Gifted.

07:59.813 --> 08:00.897
Okay. I think about it.

08:00.981 --> 08:03.984
I try to find something for him
to keep him out of trouble.

08:04.067 --> 08:05.902
<i>-¿Está bien?</i>
<i>-Está bien.</i>

08:06.027 --> 08:09.614
All I'm saying is,
if we don't tell Shao the truth ourselves,

08:09.698 --> 08:11.491
there's plenty of other crews
who are gonna snitch.

08:11.574 --> 08:13.076
So, you tell him. Whoa.

08:13.284 --> 08:15.412
Well, excuse me, fake-ass nigga.

-Find Shao, get the hell out of here.

10:04.229 --> 10:05.688

10:09.484 --> 10:11.694
-Fuck.
-Over here this way. Come on.

10:11.778 --> 10:14.405
No. It's not just a cane.

10:14.489 --> 10:16.241
It's what's inside that counts.

10:17.200 --> 10:18.118

Yo, church girl.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.971
Look. It's the criminal.

10:38.054 --> 10:41.099
You know I've known Zeke almost
my whole life, and he's a good person.

10:41.182 --> 10:44.144
-Yeah. He cool.
-Don't think for a minute

10:44.227 --> 10:46.771
that you're gonna
drag Ezekiel down with you.

10:46.855 --> 10:51.401
Why you talking about this motherfucker
like he some sort of saint or some shit?

10:51.484 --> 10:54.946
-Like he don't steal like the rest of us.
-Ezekiel would never steal.

10:55.029 --> 10:56.156
You sure?

10:59.284 --> 11:01.619
Everybody here is stealing. Even you.

11:01.744 --> 11:07.333
How about maybe you ask Zeke whose idea
it was to rob Les Inferno last night.

11:09.836 --> 11:12.422
So you telling me
that because of the blackout,

11:12.505 --> 11:15.216
Mayor Beame is not gonna deliver
on the $10 million

11:15.300 --> 11:17.427

for my people here?

11:17.510 --> 11:19.387
Hey, don't shoot the messenger.

11:19.470 --> 11:21.431
The messenger can be shot, Stanley.

11:21.514 --> 11:24.017
-There were promises--
-I got this Pierre Cardin suit, man.

11:24.100 --> 11:26.394
- It's brand-new. It's your size.
- I'm talking here?

11:26.477 --> 11:28.980
<i>-¿Qué te pasa? </i> Whoa, whoa, whoa.
-No disrespect intended.

11:29.063 --> 11:30.899
-That's real Pierre Cardin?
-Check the label.

11:30.982 --> 11:33.109
-Boosted it from Gimbels in the blackout.
-How much?

11:33.192 --> 11:34.819
-Give me 12.
-Ten.

11:34.903 --> 11:37.280
This is exactly the thing
that'll get us in trouble.

11:37.363 --> 11:38.990
-What?
-You supporting the black market,

11:39.073 --> 11:39.908
post-blackout.

11:39.991 --> 11:42.827
At a time like this,
the mayor simply cannot afford

11:42.911 --> 11:45.914
to be associated with an extremely
colorful character like yourself.

11:45.997 --> 11:48.708
-Hold this for me, bro. How about this?
-It's an election year.

11:49.208 --> 11:50.627
Stanley, you told me

11:50.710 --> 11:53.713
Beame would promise me funds
if I deliver votes for him, right?

11:53.796 --> 11:56.966
Yeah, but who could predict we're gonna
have a blackout? Look at this mess.

11:57.050 --> 11:58.384
-"This mess"?
-Hey.

11:58.468 --> 12:00.720
This mess is why the dream
is so important, man.

12:00.803 --> 12:01.930
-Hey.
-Promises, Stanley.

12:02.013 --> 12:02.847
Cisco, hey!

12:04.307 --> 12:05.767
Fuck you.

12:05.850 --> 12:07.268
Fuck Beame.

12:08.478 --> 12:09.604
Yo, Shao.

12:10.229 --> 12:12.565
Yo, just come here a second, please.

12:13.232 --> 12:16.277
Hey, let's get out of here.
We gotta tell you something.

12:16.361 --> 12:18.655
Hope it's the reason
you ain't got no records.

12:18.738 --> 12:21.032
- Well, not exactly.
- Let's just get out of here.

12:21.115 --> 12:22.909
I'll tell you why you got nothing.

12:22.992 --> 12:26.204
-I think you should know--
-Y'all can't spot a good record yet.

12:26.329 --> 12:29.624
- Man, we couldn't get anything good, man.
- Well, well, well. Look at this.

12:29.707 --> 12:31.918
Well, if it ain't the lame-ass, wack-ass,

12:32.001 --> 12:34.671
-bootleg-wannabe counterfeit niggas.
-Hold my shit.

12:34.754 --> 12:37.215
Fucking fake phony bitches.
Get this nigga, man.

12:37.298 --> 12:38.716
- Back up.
- Yo, Shao, Shao.

12:38.800 --> 12:40.843
-Back up, back up.
-Shut the fuck up.

12:40.927 --> 12:42.553
-Come on, come on.
-Back up, toy.

12:42.637 --> 12:44.681
"Toy"? What part of town
you think you in, nigga?

12:44.764 --> 12:46.599
Y'all the Notorious Three
from Sedgwick, right?

12:46.683 --> 12:49.185
From the home of the best DJ
on the planet, Kool Herc.

12:49.268 --> 12:50.144
Right, yeah.

12:50.228 --> 12:52.814
Nigga, this is Flash territory.
Watch your fucking step.

12:52.897 --> 12:54.732
Nigga, we step wherever we wanna step.

12:54.816 --> 12:57.902
-You gonna step back.
-Get the fuck out of here with that shit.

12:57.986 --> 13:00.321
What's the Herculoids doing outside
of Herc territory?

13:00.405 --> 13:04.534
Just 'cause you on Flash's dick don't
mean we gotta be. Maytag motherfucker.

13:04.993 --> 13:08.413
Right? I got a good mind to fuck you up.
Faking a funk like that.

13:08.496 --> 13:09.872
Disrespecting the art form.

13:09.956 --> 13:11.416
Wait, what? Disrespecting?

13:11.499 --> 13:13.501
-Yeah. Disrespecting your own Grandmaster.
-Wait.

13:13.584 --> 13:16.004
-Yeah, that's right.
-Disrespecting the Grandmaster?

13:16.087 --> 13:18.715
Grandmaster Flash is family to me.
I was his record boy.

13:18.840 --> 13:21.551
He put me on.
What the fuck are you talking about?

13:21.634 --> 13:24.178
- I bet you he don't know.
- Shit! He don't know!

13:24.262 --> 13:26.723
Y'all didn't tell your motherfucking DJ
what y'all done?

13:27.432 --> 13:30.643
-He fucked up. Tell him, nigga.
-What the fuck y'all did?

13:30.727 --> 13:32.311
Yo, Shao. We didn't mean nothing.

13:32.395 --> 13:34.647
They used a bootleg Flash tape
to throw a party.

13:35.648 --> 13:38.026
After the fire, after our fight,
we just wanted to make money

13:38.109 --> 13:40.403
- so we could get new gear--
- Look, Shao, look...

13:40.486 --> 13:41.487
It was my idea.

13:41.612 --> 13:45.199
So, we went to Jack Knife E-Z credit,
but we couldn't get a line of credit.

13:45.283 --> 13:46.784
But they had a bootleg tape.

13:46.868 --> 13:49.954
And this motherfucker pretended that
he was a DJ to play to it.

13:50.038 --> 13:52.165
-I gotta tell Flash before he finds out.
-Wait, Shao.

13:52.248 --> 13:54.834
-You can't, man. It's--
-Flash already knows.

13:54.917 --> 13:56.002
What?

13:57.628 --> 14:01.674
You know, 'cause Caesars showed up,
and he took the motherfucking tape, nigga.

14:01.758 --> 14:03.176
Y'all know.

14:03.259 --> 14:04.260
Look, the Caesers' words exactly,

14:04.343 --> 14:07.055
they said the Fantastic Four Plus One
is dead to the Grandmaster.

14:07.889 --> 14:09.807
Forever.

14:12.393 --> 14:15.313
You niggas be coming at me
all high and mighty and shit.

14:15.396 --> 14:18.357
Talking about I'm doing shit
the wrong way. That I'm bad.

14:18.441 --> 14:21.611
Yeah, nigga. I got my problems,
but at least I have a fucking code.

14:21.694 --> 14:23.696
We was just trying to get
some gear for us.

14:23.780 --> 14:24.947
Get some...?

14:25.573 --> 14:27.450
By pretending to be somebody you're not?

14:29.452 --> 14:32.372
-What we gonna do, Shao?
-I'm gonna go see the Grandmaster.

14:32.455 --> 14:33.956
Later for y'all.

14:34.040 --> 14:35.333
No, wait. What we gonna do?

14:35.416 --> 14:37.752
What we gonna do?

14:38.961 --> 14:41.839
- You fucked up now.
- Y'all done fucked up?

-No. No more calls. Take a message.

15:48.072 --> 15:51.325
-You mean fucking Herbert Gunns?
-Yeah. I think so.

15:51.409 --> 15:53.286
Herbert Gunns wants to talk to me?
What for?

15:53.870 --> 15:55.496
He said it's about cock.

15:55.580 --> 15:57.582
Cock?
What the fuck are you talking about?

15:57.665 --> 16:00.376
-Cock. Ed Cock.

16:04.839 --> 16:06.007

-Koch.
<i>-¡Sí! </i> Koch.

16:10.303 --> 16:12.472

-When?

16:14.599 --> 16:15.808
Now. Tonight.

16:15.892 --> 16:17.768
He said that Percy Sutton said,

16:17.852 --> 16:20.062
Fuerte's the only guy who could
deliver the Bronx.

16:20.146 --> 16:21.272

16:21.939 --> 16:24.567

16:25.443 --> 16:27.153
Okay. They wanna meet me tonight?

16:27.236 --> 16:29.655

they gotta come here to my office.

16:29.739 --> 16:32.533
Go, go. Tell them. Hey, Lopez.

16:33.117 --> 16:35.786
Do me a favor. Go upstairs,
see if you can get my shirt pressed

16:35.870 --> 16:38.915
and get my jacket and some socks
and <i>un poquito de</i> scotch.

16:39.040 --> 16:41.334
<i>-Está bien.</i>
-And a jelly donut.

16:50.301 --> 16:51.511

16:51.594 --> 16:53.763

the Caesars will be there.

16:53.846 --> 16:56.057
Set your gear up in the alley,

17:52.488 --> 17:54.865
The one about your parents

Amidst all this madness that's going on,

18:01.664 --> 18:03.958
you were the one person
I thought about the most.

18:04.667 --> 18:08.170

18:12.091 --> 18:15.886

help you with scholarships for colleges.

you're a perfect candidate.

18:18.472 --> 18:22.268
You're poor, you're from the South Bronx,
you're half black, half Puerto Rican...

18:22.768 --> 18:23.811
and you're smart.

what happened to Adele's shop?

18:40.703 --> 18:42.204
It got busted up last night.

18:42.288 --> 18:44.123
- Some people just stupid.
- Yeah.

18:44.248 --> 18:45.458

-We threw a little party.
-You see, I--

20:12.795 --> 20:15.923
It was just to raise money for our

we never met, and things got out of hand.

22:13.791 --> 22:16.877
I can't believe I'm standing here
with <i>the</i> Rumi.

22:19.255 --> 22:21.966
-What do you write?
-Me? I'm nobody.

22:22.049 --> 22:23.467
Aw, come on.

22:24.677 --> 22:25.553
I write Thor.

22:26.887 --> 22:28.305
My...

22:28.389 --> 22:30.099
You're Thor?

22:30.849 --> 22:32.393
Wow.

22:33.185 --> 22:37.648
I'm telling you, Ed.
All these things that you said here...

22:37.731 --> 22:40.859
I gotta say... I'm very impressed.

22:40.943 --> 22:41.819
Very impressed.

22:41.902 --> 22:45.364
Frankly, I wish I could say
the same thing about you.

22:47.199 --> 22:49.743
-Excuse me?
-Look...

22:50.286 --> 22:54.456
Mayor Beame dumped you today.
You think my people don't have ears?

22:54.540 --> 23:00.004
So, all due respect, if you wanna ride
with Team Koch... then number one:

23:00.921 --> 23:04.550
lower yourself just a little bit
off of that high horse.

23:04.633 --> 23:07.595
Number two:
you need to clean up your act here.

23:07.678 --> 23:10.097
My...act? What act is that?

23:10.180 --> 23:11.599
Come on. You're a poverty pimp.

23:11.724 --> 23:13.934
Yeah?

23:14.518 --> 23:16.061
Is that who I am?

23:16.770 --> 23:20.232
Well, who are you, Ed?
And I'm not speaking rhetorically here.

23:20.316 --> 23:22.860
I'm really asking. Who the fuck are you?

23:25.070 --> 23:28.907
<i>You see my streets out there? You even</i>
<i>bother to take a look on your way in?</i>

23:28.991 --> 23:30.826
<i>You people downtown.</i>

23:30.909 --> 23:35.956
You are perpetrating a cold,
calculated, well-organized

23:36.040 --> 23:38.667
urban genocide on all of my people up here

23:38.751 --> 23:42.338
and then you got the balls
to come walking in here

23:42.421 --> 23:45.633
and tell me that I need
to get my act together--

23:45.716 --> 23:47.259
Sorry I'm late.

23:47.343 --> 23:48.594
What did I miss?

23:51.472 --> 23:54.099
Happy to finally meet you in person,
Francisco.

23:54.183 --> 23:56.477
-Your reputation precedes you.
-Exactly.

23:56.560 --> 23:58.812
-And that's the problem.
-Settle down, Ed.

23:59.355 --> 24:00.689
Herbert Gunns. Now.

24:00.773 --> 24:03.275
I realize you are wondering
who the hell I am.

24:03.359 --> 24:07.071
No, I know exactly who you are.
I do my homework.

24:07.237 --> 24:08.656
And...

24:09.323 --> 24:12.451
I gotta say... I admire you.

24:12.534 --> 24:14.787
You came up under Robert Moses.

24:14.870 --> 24:17.956
And then from there,
you left the public sector

24:18.040 --> 24:21.460
and went into private "construction."

24:22.336 --> 24:25.047
You made yourself
a billion and a half or...

24:25.130 --> 24:28.592
And now, you are one of six kings

24:28.676 --> 24:31.512
who sit on the city
Fiscal Control Committee,

24:31.595 --> 24:33.722
and you guys run everything.

24:33.806 --> 24:36.058
You run everything
and you don't answer to nobody.

24:36.141 --> 24:39.228
No mayors, no governors,
not even God Almighty.

24:39.311 --> 24:40.604
<i>¿Correcto?</i>

24:40.688 --> 24:43.315
Well, I do have a wife
and a teenage daughter,

24:43.399 --> 24:46.694
and believe me...
I answer to them for everything.

24:49.154 --> 24:51.699
Now, if I may, Francisco.

24:51.782 --> 24:53.909
Let's just cut right to the chase.

24:54.493 --> 24:56.495
Deliver the vote for Ed.

24:56.578 --> 25:00.499
One month after he's sworn in,
you'll have your $10 million carve-out

25:00.582 --> 25:02.251
to build affordable housing in the Bronx.

25:02.876 --> 25:05.754
Not "housing," Herbert.

25:05.838 --> 25:07.214
"Houses."

25:09.425 --> 25:11.051
I got the model right here.

25:11.135 --> 25:13.804
-And I'd like to tell you--
-You don't have to sell to me.

25:13.887 --> 25:17.975
You give the people... ownership
of something, they'll thrive.

25:18.058 --> 25:22.771
Warehouse them in ill-conceived projects,
and the result is vandalism,

25:22.855 --> 25:25.691
-graffiti, drugs, murder.
-At least you agree on something.

25:26.233 --> 25:29.069
-Now my partner, David Rockefeller.
-I know him.

25:29.153 --> 25:32.239
Yeah, he's a good man.
Now he's put together a group

25:32.322 --> 25:35.659
to revitalize Wall Street
and develop Battery Park.

25:35.743 --> 25:38.203
He's got a billion bucks in grants
from the state.

25:38.287 --> 25:40.789
And your $10 million for the Bronx
comes from that.

25:41.665 --> 25:43.083
And...

25:44.042 --> 25:45.335
what you said...

25:46.003 --> 25:48.589
you're willing to put that part of it
down on paper?

25:48.672 --> 25:49.757
Absolutely.

25:49.840 --> 25:52.217
Now, understand me.

25:52.301 --> 25:55.137
In order for Ed and I to make
the changes this city needs,

25:55.220 --> 25:56.764
we need a mandate.

25:56.847 --> 26:00.684
And to get that mandate, Ed here needs
to win by at least ten points in November.

26:00.768 --> 26:03.437
So, I'm not just asking you
to deliver the Bronx.

26:04.229 --> 26:06.190
I'm asking you, Francisco,

26:06.273 --> 26:09.443
for you and your people
to tear down the competition...

26:09.985 --> 26:11.987
wherever you find it.

26:12.070 --> 26:13.405
This is war.

26:13.530 --> 26:16.742
Well, as long as Ed here has my back...

26:17.284 --> 26:19.870
believe me... I got his.

26:20.871 --> 26:22.372
Then we have a deal.

26:22.956 --> 26:24.875
-Right, Ed?
-Mazel tov!

26:26.418 --> 26:29.880
Yeah,
and I wanna hold a rally up here.

26:29.963 --> 26:33.801
Now, obviously, not every kid
in the South Bronx is a criminal.

26:33.884 --> 26:36.011
Find me a good one to stand onstage with.

26:36.094 --> 26:37.679
- Like a poster boy.
- Exactly.

26:38.263 --> 26:40.182
We'll do a little event up here.

26:40.265 --> 26:42.684
You'll announce your support
for my candidacy.

26:42.768 --> 26:44.353
The kid says a few words, too.

26:44.436 --> 26:47.314
And represents the positive image
of the new South Bronx.

26:47.397 --> 26:49.274
I got the perfect kid for you.

26:49.900 --> 26:50.776
And one other thing.

26:50.859 --> 26:54.822
Now, I know this may not be
our most pressing concern,

26:54.905 --> 26:56.448
but graffiti.

26:57.074 --> 27:00.118
The plebeians, the average Joes,
they hate it.

27:00.202 --> 27:02.496
And they love it when I rail against it.

27:02.579 --> 27:05.999
And we need you, as a minority,
to champion the cause.

27:06.083 --> 27:09.503
If you want me to do
a little anti-graffiti dance...

27:11.129 --> 27:12.673
you give me that money.

27:12.756 --> 27:15.342
You help me achieve my vision.

27:15.425 --> 27:20.097
And I will get those graffiti writers
flogged in a public square if you want.

27:20.180 --> 27:21.390
Flogging.

27:21.473 --> 27:24.518
Well, that works for me. Excellent.

27:32.776 --> 27:36.154
You got Daze, Crash, Butch,
Blade and Tracy?

27:36.238 --> 27:37.698
Stayhigh.

27:37.781 --> 27:39.157
Voice of the Ghetto.

27:39.867 --> 27:41.034
Yo...

27:42.703 --> 27:44.913
is this really Shao 007?

27:44.997 --> 27:46.164
It's the real thing.

27:46.248 --> 27:48.458
Talented, crazy free.

27:48.542 --> 27:50.627
Yeah, man, but what happened to him?

27:50.711 --> 27:52.045
He went all-city.

27:52.129 --> 27:54.464
Did that Clan of the Dragon Fist joint.

27:54.548 --> 27:56.133
Turned ghost?

27:56.216 --> 27:57.634
He's still around.

27:57.718 --> 27:59.511
He's a DJ now.

27:59.595 --> 28:02.055
-Like-- Like clubs? Like disco?
-No.

28:02.139 --> 28:03.307
Not like clubs.

28:03.390 --> 28:05.893
-Haven't heard of the get down, have you?
-The what?

28:05.976 --> 28:07.853
This music thing we're trying to do.

28:07.936 --> 28:10.772
-Could I check it out?
-Not yet. We're still decoding it.

28:12.232 --> 28:14.067
This next stop is me.

28:14.151 --> 28:15.861
Whoa, hey, let's exchange books.

28:16.403 --> 28:17.905
Make something beautiful. Go wild.

28:17.988 --> 28:20.449
Make the craziest, nastiest, freest,

28:20.532 --> 28:22.743
most revolutionary piece
you ever did in it.

28:22.826 --> 28:24.870
Thanks.

28:29.791 --> 28:32.419
-You do the same in mine?
-You bet.

28:32.502 --> 28:35.005
I'll meet you back
at the writer's bench this weekend.

29:10.249 --> 29:13.669
I'm telling you, everybody in the
South Bronx knows the Caesars' rep.

29:13.752 --> 29:15.587
And most of us ain't got no death wish,

29:15.671 --> 29:19.341
so, no, I don't know nothing about nobody
selling no bootleg tape like that.

29:28.100 --> 29:31.186

for bootlegs from the Grandmaster?

29:53.375 --> 29:56.378
Straight from Brooklyn,
Grandmaster Flowers.

29:56.461 --> 29:59.464
Brooklyn?
Give a fuck about this shit.

30:00.173 --> 30:01.466
I need Grandmaster Flash.

30:10.434 --> 30:13.895
If I don't find this bootlegger,
I'm not spinning no more.

30:13.979 --> 30:17.107
-I might as well die.
-Don't talk like that, Shao. Come on.

30:17.190 --> 30:20.027
You a hustler, not a DJ.

30:20.110 --> 30:23.238
E, you ain't got one of these
Flash bootleg tapes, do you?

30:23.322 --> 30:25.949
No fucking way, man. Flash is king.

30:26.033 --> 30:28.869
I respect the source.
Come on. You know me.

30:28.952 --> 30:31.455
Fuck, man. I'm fucked.

-Yo. That's my face.
-That's his face.

31:46.279 --> 31:47.489
For real, Shao.

31:47.572 --> 31:50.409
You know how many people request
my ride 'cause I got these tapes?

31:50.492 --> 31:53.328
I'm gonna just tell the Caesars,
and they'll straight off your ass.

-They call him King of Cassettes.

<i>- Hi.</i>

32:26.987 --> 32:29.281
Hey. Who's Dave?

32:29.865 --> 32:32.325
Dave is my florist.

32:33.869 --> 32:34.995

32:35.078 --> 32:37.664
<i>-I'm into flowers, you know?</i>
-Okay. Um...

32:37.747 --> 32:40.083
Well... Jackie, you know, my <i>tío</i>,

32:40.167 --> 32:42.043
he's been asking
when the song's gonna be ready,

32:42.127 --> 32:44.713
and I've been lying to him,
but I think he's getting suspicious.

32:44.796 --> 32:46.715
Tell him it's finished.

32:46.798 --> 32:49.259
It's finishing-- I'm finishing it.

32:49.342 --> 32:50.510
Finishing touches.

32:50.594 --> 32:53.138
<i>-Jackie, you all right?</i>
-Okay. You tell him that.

32:53.221 --> 32:55.348
You know, maybe I should
come down there and help out.

<i>Fuck!</i>

-He's here to exterminate.
<i>-Jackie?</i>

33:01.813 --> 33:03.356
-I gotta go.
<i>-Hello?</i>

33:04.357 --> 33:06.526
What the--?
He just, like, hung up.

33:06.610 --> 33:07.944
For real?

33:08.069 --> 33:10.322
- Yo, where he live at?
- I don't know.

33:10.405 --> 33:14.117
-The Chelsea. I think it's a hotel.
-March down to that fancy-ass hotel

33:14.201 --> 33:16.411
and you're gonna beat his punk ass.
Right now.

33:16.495 --> 33:19.414
Regina, I can't. I have to go with Zeke
to his internship interview

33:19.498 --> 33:21.249
with my <i>tío</i> today...

33:21.333 --> 33:24.252
and shit, there's no way he's not
gonna be asking about the song.

33:24.336 --> 33:26.796
Which he's paying for.
I'm gonna have to lie to him again.

33:26.880 --> 33:28.715
Tell him everything's great,
everything's fine.

33:28.798 --> 33:31.593
The song is great, which it clearly ain't.

33:32.928 --> 33:35.805
<i>Coño,</i> man, I think Jackie's a <i>tocado.</i>
What if my <i>tío</i> finds out?

33:35.889 --> 33:38.183
So, get Zeke to go with you after.

33:38.975 --> 33:40.727
She right. He owe you.

33:40.810 --> 33:42.103
I mean, shit. He been blessed,

33:42.187 --> 33:44.397
the fact that you let him
between your long-ass legs,

33:44.481 --> 33:46.900
and now this whole intern-whatever?

33:46.983 --> 33:48.944
Damn, girl. He owe you.

33:49.486 --> 33:50.403
For life.

33:51.613 --> 33:52.697
Yeah.

33:55.116 --> 33:57.827
Why you hiding from me, Jacquito?

33:58.411 --> 34:01.164
If Jackie Moreno fucks with
my niece's dream, Lopez...

34:01.831 --> 34:03.166
God help him.

34:03.250 --> 34:06.253
You're the guy who's read more
books than all of our friends combined.

34:06.336 --> 34:09.089
- Come on. You even read the newspaper.
- Don't tell nobody that.

34:09.172 --> 34:12.007
-You clever as hell. So, why you nervous?
-I ain't nervous.

34:12.092 --> 34:13.717
Then why your palms sweaty?

34:14.344 --> 34:16.471
'Cause you hot.

34:17.681 --> 34:19.891
Also, your uncle does kind of scare me.

34:19.975 --> 34:22.936
You want me to get my lucky bat,
go knocky-knocky at the Chelsea?

34:23.018 --> 34:24.646
Not yet.

34:26.565 --> 34:28.650
-Myle.
<i>-Tío.</i>

34:28.733 --> 34:30.777
<i>-Dios te bendiga.</i>
<i>-Bendición.</i>

34:30.860 --> 34:32.279
Come on in.

34:45.917 --> 34:47.127
Shit.

34:47.210 --> 34:49.045
Yo, yo, yo. It's Shao, man.

34:49.963 --> 34:51.422
I gotta lock the fucking door.

34:51.505 --> 34:53.592
No, wait a minute.
But if we lock the fucking door

34:53.675 --> 34:55.010
it's gonna look like we soft.

34:56.303 --> 34:57.804
Soft, man--

34:59.681 --> 35:01.182
So, this the scene of the crime?

35:03.685 --> 35:05.478
- Where's Zeke at?
- Look, Shao.

35:05.562 --> 35:07.647
It wasn't Zeke's fault,
the whole bootleg-tape shit.

35:07.731 --> 35:10.650
I ask you whose fault it is,
or I ask you where he be at?

35:11.359 --> 35:13.403
Look, look, look.
Dizzee's just trying to say

35:13.486 --> 35:15.113
don't take it all out on Zeke, man.

35:15.822 --> 35:18.450
- Really?
- Yo, gun! Gun!

35:19.159 --> 35:21.119
I found the bootlegger.

35:21.202 --> 35:23.288
Y'all some fucking faggots, man.

35:23.371 --> 35:25.248
Yeah. I ain't no faggot.

35:26.124 --> 35:28.835
And Zeke at Papa Fuerte's volunteering.

35:28.918 --> 35:32.130
He went out for this internship interview.

35:32.213 --> 35:34.758
-What's an internship?
-Internship is when you go downtown

35:34.841 --> 35:36.843
and you work for the white man
but never get paid.

35:36.926 --> 35:39.220
- Are you serious?
- Yeah. That's what he told us.

35:39.304 --> 35:41.848
That's really fucked up.

35:41.931 --> 35:45.310
That bitch Mylene
put him up to some shit like that, right?

35:45.393 --> 35:47.937
- Look, they in love, man.
- What?

35:48.021 --> 35:50.315
She's church trash. A holy fucking ho.

35:50.398 --> 35:53.276
And Books is trying to tap that,
and she ain't giving it up.

35:53.360 --> 35:55.445
-Gave it to him the other night.
-What?

35:55.528 --> 35:58.365
Homeboy tapped it on our roof. I heard it.

35:58.448 --> 35:59.949
Yeah. I thought it was cats.

36:00.033 --> 36:01.534
So, how much longer we gotta wait

36:01.618 --> 36:04.371
before you knock that Misty Holloway
to the number two spot?

36:04.454 --> 36:06.915
The new song? It's fly, <i>tío.</i>

36:06.998 --> 36:10.085
Good. Well maybe you can debut it
at my fundraiser tonight.

36:10.168 --> 36:12.504
I'd love to,
but it's not quite ready yet.

36:12.587 --> 36:15.215
Well, you tell Jackie
to come and see me tonight.

36:15.298 --> 36:16.716
He's just trying to impress you
with a great song.

36:16.800 --> 36:18.218
Tell him to bring whatever he's got.

36:18.760 --> 36:22.097
I will. Now, <i>tío,</i> this is Ezekiel.

36:22.180 --> 36:24.349
I know exactly who this is.

36:24.432 --> 36:27.644
Come have a seat... Mr. Figuero.

36:29.688 --> 36:35.360
Yo. Y'all see Books before me... y'all
tell him I need his ass for a mission.

36:35.443 --> 36:36.403
Hey, hey.

36:36.486 --> 36:37.737
We can come.

36:38.405 --> 36:39.739
Whatever it is, we down.

36:39.823 --> 36:44.202
We going deep into Herc territory...
to fix the damage that y'all caused.

36:45.412 --> 36:50.500
I got banned, man. From spinning.
For fucking life.

36:50.583 --> 36:55.088
So, y'all gonna stay here
and clean up Mama's fucking store!

36:57.090 --> 36:58.883
Y'all fucking lucky!

37:00.593 --> 37:01.511
Thank Books.

37:04.222 --> 37:06.558
- So, you dating my niece?
- No, sir.

37:06.641 --> 37:09.144
Well, she seems to think
that you're really special.

37:09.227 --> 37:11.521
So, you what,
running some kind of game, son?

37:12.230 --> 37:14.190
-Nod and smile, son.
-What?

37:14.274 --> 37:19.237
Mylene, she's eyeballing us right now.
Just smile and nod. Yeah.

37:20.405 --> 37:21.531
Smile, nod.

37:22.282 --> 37:25.243
See now, you're gonna have to
prove yourself in my eyes

37:25.326 --> 37:27.871
'cause I know a little street hustler
when I see one

37:27.954 --> 37:30.331
'cause I used to be one, too.?

37:32.250 --> 37:34.294
But I believe in second chances.

37:35.253 --> 37:38.673
I appreciate that, but what did I do wrong
to have to need a second chance?

37:38.757 --> 37:41.050
What I'm saying is don't fuck this up.

37:43.094 --> 37:45.472
Smile and nod.

37:45.555 --> 37:49.184
And of course it should go without saying,
do not mess with my niece.

37:49.267 --> 37:51.352
<i>-¿Estamos claro con eso?</i>
<i>-Sí.</i>

37:51.978 --> 37:55.106
Good. Congratulations.
You got yourself the internship.

37:56.608 --> 37:59.027
<i>¿Qué te pasa?</i>

38:01.988 --> 38:03.990
-Nothing.
-No, don't "nothing" me.

38:04.073 --> 38:06.701
-Come on, son. Spit it out.
-Here's the thing.

38:06.785 --> 38:12.540
And no offense, Mr. Papa Fuerte,
but... I'm not sure I want an internship.

38:12.624 --> 38:13.583
You don't what?

38:13.666 --> 38:16.920
No disrespect, but the Fiscal Control
Committee, I looked it up,

38:17.003 --> 38:19.714
the guy I'd be working for,
Mr. Gunns, that place?

38:19.798 --> 38:22.217
That's where they do
the planned-shrinkage stuff, right?

38:22.300 --> 38:24.219
Those are the guys that cut our services.

38:24.302 --> 38:25.386
Who burn down our buildings

38:25.470 --> 38:28.097
and can't wait till
we all dead or in jail.

38:28.181 --> 38:31.017
Or on drugs or, you know,
on the first bus out of their city.

38:31.100 --> 38:34.145
-It's not just their city.
-Yeah. Try telling them that.

38:34.229 --> 38:35.814
I do. Every day.

38:36.356 --> 38:37.857
But I can't do it alone.

38:38.441 --> 38:39.984
I need help.

38:40.735 --> 38:44.489
Our people,
all of our people... need help.

38:44.572 --> 38:46.866
This internship's
in the World Trade Center.

38:46.950 --> 38:50.119
-Twin Towers. <i>Tranquilo, tranquilo.</i>
-But, sir--

38:50.203 --> 38:51.579
Come here, son.

38:53.623 --> 38:56.960
There's a whole lot a kids out there
with no hope.

38:57.043 --> 38:58.753
And it's contagious.

38:59.754 --> 39:02.423
Crabs in the barrel, in the ghetto.

39:08.429 --> 39:11.224
Got a bunch of crabs in a barrel,
one's trying to climb out.

39:11.975 --> 39:16.354
All the other crabs just claw him
until he goes right back down again.

39:16.437 --> 39:18.648
One man fall, we all fall.

39:23.653 --> 39:25.697
That's the reality of what you face, son.

39:27.365 --> 39:28.491
See, you're afraid...

39:29.117 --> 39:31.578
you're afraid
what you're meant to be...

39:31.661 --> 39:34.747
is gonna take you away
from what's familiar.

39:34.831 --> 39:36.541
But look at that familiar.

39:36.624 --> 39:38.001
Until we change it...

39:39.419 --> 39:40.628
It's true.

39:43.339 --> 39:45.174
I'll tell you a little secret.

39:45.258 --> 39:46.759
Fear?

39:47.010 --> 39:48.052
Fear's your friend.

39:48.136 --> 39:50.638
You take this internship,
you excel with it.

39:50.722 --> 39:52.765
You're gonna be out there
looking out for me.

39:52.849 --> 39:54.893
I, in turn,
I'll look out for you and yours.

39:54.976 --> 39:56.603
But do it right.

39:56.686 --> 39:58.104
You do it right.

39:58.771 --> 40:01.065
<i>-¿Tú me entiendes? </i> You understand?
<i>-Sí.</i>

40:08.740 --> 40:11.534
So, you want this internship?

40:11.618 --> 40:15.079
-Yes, sir.
-Good. Good. Hit me.

40:16.205 --> 40:18.249
Go out to Third Avenue,
and go buy yourself a suit.

40:18.333 --> 40:21.044
Get yourself some pencils.
You start at 9 a.m. tomorrow.

40:21.127 --> 40:22.420
Okay.

40:23.296 --> 40:24.923
Be early?

40:25.006 --> 40:26.758
You gonna be on <i>blanquito</i> time now.

40:26.841 --> 40:28.134
You ain't early, you late.

40:28.801 --> 40:30.219
Don't be late.

40:30.303 --> 40:32.096
All right. Thank you, sir.

40:36.100 --> 40:38.770
I like your <i>tío</i> a lot, Mylene.
Folks got him all wrong.

40:39.896 --> 40:41.856
I went in not even wanting the internship,

40:41.940 --> 40:45.026
and by the time I finished talking
with your <i>tío, </i> I feel like...

40:45.818 --> 40:47.403
you know, he's sharp, you know?

40:47.487 --> 40:50.448
This is the right thing for me,
it really is. Yeah.

40:51.866 --> 40:54.535
Will you come down to the city with me
right now?

40:55.203 --> 40:57.664
Because I really need to go see Jackie.

40:57.747 --> 40:58.915
It's really important.

40:58.998 --> 41:01.501
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. Whatever you want.
-Yeah?

41:01.584 --> 41:04.295
Yeah. Sure. Wherever you wanna go.

41:04.379 --> 41:08.466
-Well, well, well. Look at you.
-Hey, Shao.

41:08.549 --> 41:10.593
No. No, no.

41:10.677 --> 41:14.472
No way am I gonna let my <i>tío</i>
see you with this criminal.

41:14.555 --> 41:16.766
So, I'm the fucking criminal.

41:16.849 --> 41:18.685
You and your boys faked the funk.

41:18.768 --> 41:22.480
Get me banned for life from doing the one
thing that makes me wanna fucking live.

41:22.563 --> 41:25.566
You over here kissing on your bitch
in the pussy-whipped land of lovey-dovey.

41:25.650 --> 41:28.736
-Hey, it ain't like that.
-Listen, you stay away from us, okay?

41:28.820 --> 41:31.864
Because he told me all about you.
I know everything. Okay?

41:31.948 --> 41:34.117
<i>-Todo, ¿entiendes?</i>
-Fuck she talking about, Zeke?

41:34.200 --> 41:35.868
-Told?
-Nothing, she--

41:35.952 --> 41:38.579
-What'd you tell her?
-She's emotional. She got emotional.

41:38.663 --> 41:40.748
- I'm emotional?
- You know what? Fuck you.

41:42.250 --> 41:44.085
Shao, hey!

41:44.585 --> 41:48.131
Hey, I know you don't like him,
but he's done good to me. Please.

41:48.214 --> 41:51.175
- Make it quick.
- Hold up!

41:51.259 --> 41:52.552
Hey, let me explain.

41:52.635 --> 41:56.264
Yo, I found the dude who's bootlegging
these Flash shows, man.

Yo, hurry up.

We bring this dude in for justice...

42:03.563 --> 42:05.106
Flash will give me a pass.

42:05.898 --> 42:07.942
He'll give you one, too,
if you still wanna be a MC.

42:08.026 --> 42:10.236
-Come on, bro. You know I do.
-Prove it.

42:10.319 --> 42:11.904

42:11.988 --> 42:15.867
This is my fucking life I'm talking about.
Shit can't wait.

42:15.950 --> 42:18.578
So, whatever. Be with your bitch.
I'm about to go get this thief.

Hey, hey, hey. Wait, whoa,
I'll come with you. Just give me a second.

42:27.378 --> 42:29.630
Shao needs me.
It's about a music thing.

42:29.714 --> 42:31.340
Hell, no.

42:31.424 --> 42:32.633
Hell, no. Are you kidding me?

42:32.717 --> 42:35.261
-Just for tonight.

you'd done me like this.

- Fifteen-20.

45:22.219 --> 45:25.306
-Fifteen-20?
-1520 Sedgwick.

45:25.389 --> 45:29.185
1520 Sedgwick Avenue.
Yo, yo, that's where Kool Herc be at.

45:29.268 --> 45:32.229
And that's where Shao and Zeke are
gonna try to track down that bootlegger.

45:32.313 --> 45:35.024
Hell, no. After all this shit

45:35.107 --> 45:37.026
now you want us to run off to Sedgwick?

45:37.109 --> 45:40.446
If the Herculoids don't kill us then
Mom and Dad will as soon as we get back.

45:40.529 --> 45:42.073
I'll go.

45:42.156 --> 45:43.282
But how we gonna get there?

45:43.366 --> 45:44.909
I don't know, but let's go. All right?

45:44.992 --> 45:46.702
Look, them boys is gonna need us, man.

45:46.786 --> 45:48.955
Haven't you been over to Sedgwick,
right, Dizz?

45:49.038 --> 45:51.666
Only Ninja style with spray cans.
That's enemy turf over there.

45:51.749 --> 45:55.169
Come on, Dizz. We a crew.
Them boys is gonna need us.

45:55.252 --> 45:57.755
-And I thought you was a rebel.
-I am a rebel.

45:57.838 --> 45:59.799
But you can't be a rebel
if you don't rebel.

46:00.591 --> 46:02.009
Fuck.

46:04.053 --> 46:05.179
True.

46:05.930 --> 46:07.223
True.

46:08.474 --> 46:13.479
Let's do this like Brutus not Judas
'cause y'all knew this!

46:14.397 --> 46:16.649
<i>♪ You can't hide from yourself ♪</i>

46:16.732 --> 46:18.109
<i>♪ No ♪</i>

46:18.192 --> 46:21.904
Why you think Bambaataa
is building the Zulu Nation?

46:21.988 --> 46:23.781
Flash, Bam, Herc.

46:24.573 --> 46:27.076
'Cause they're kings
with their own kingdoms.

46:27.159 --> 46:29.954
We redeem ourselves,
we can have our own kingdom.

46:30.037 --> 46:32.456
All right. So, what's the plan?
Where we headed?

46:32.832 --> 46:34.291
Mecca.

46:34.375 --> 46:37.086
According to E, Kool Herc
is having an anniversary show.

46:37.169 --> 46:38.504
Bootlegger's gonna be there.

46:38.587 --> 46:41.007
Dude that bootlegged Flash
is gonna be there to bootleg Herc.

46:41.090 --> 46:42.341
-Right, E?
-Right.

46:42.425 --> 46:44.969
E's gonna get a Flash bootleg,
we ID this motherfucker,

46:45.052 --> 46:46.762
get that Flash tape back,

46:46.846 --> 46:49.265
and the Get Down Brothers kingdom
is within reach.

46:49.348 --> 46:53.436
MC Books and DJ Shaolin Fantastic
are on their way to being kings.

46:53.519 --> 46:56.188
-What you think about that?
-I think...

46:56.647 --> 46:58.065
<i>♪ You can't hide from yourself ♪</i>

47:02.153 --> 47:03.696

47:03.779 --> 47:06.824
I'm just trying to understand how you
could be with a dude who acts like that.

47:06.907 --> 47:08.576
What happens next time?

47:08.659 --> 47:10.995
When he does hit you
'cause there will be a next time.

47:11.078 --> 47:12.747
She'll stab his ass.

47:13.581 --> 47:14.665
That ain't love.

47:14.749 --> 47:17.084
And we all ain't you, Mylene.

47:17.168 --> 47:19.211
We all don't have pastors for a father

47:19.295 --> 47:23.340
and fucking players for an uncle
and a voice like an angel.

47:23.424 --> 47:27.011
I'm just saying, do you wanna
be living like this all your life?

47:27.094 --> 47:30.806
-I don't know. I kind of like my life.
-But why settle for that?

47:30.890 --> 47:32.558
I wanna love mine.

47:32.641 --> 47:36.353
I wanna live on Fifth Avenue
and sip champagne with Misty Holloway

47:36.437 --> 47:40.149
-and go shopping in, like, Europe.
-For real?

47:40.232 --> 47:41.067
Shoot, I'm down.

47:41.150 --> 47:43.694
We can't do any of that
if we're stuck with messed-up dudes

47:43.778 --> 47:46.405
-who could give a shit about us.
-Mylene, please.

47:46.489 --> 47:49.450
Stop acting like you're gonna save me.

47:49.533 --> 47:52.578
Last time I checked,
we on this damn train crossing the river

47:52.661 --> 47:55.081

48:12.765 --> 48:14.850
Founder started it all right here.

48:14.934 --> 48:17.853
1520 Sedgwick, the birthplace.

48:17.937 --> 48:19.230
Shit. Notorious Three.

48:20.856 --> 48:21.941
Let's go around back.

48:22.024 --> 48:24.026
Come on. Come on. Come on.

48:45.923 --> 48:47.800
So, yo.

48:47.883 --> 48:51.178
Sun goes down, E's gonna meet
this bootlegger around back.

48:57.226 --> 48:58.435
Bang on that shit.

49:13.659 --> 49:14.910
Jackie?

49:15.661 --> 49:17.413
It's me, Mylene.

49:18.747 --> 49:22.126
...my... God.

49:22.751 --> 49:25.379
You talking to me about messed up dudes.

49:26.213 --> 49:27.590
He's brilliant.

49:27.673 --> 49:28.883
Okay?

49:28.966 --> 49:32.595
He's just got like...
one or two little problems.

49:32.678 --> 49:34.054
Shit.

49:46.233 --> 49:47.610
Yo, that's the Founder.

49:47.693 --> 49:49.111
DJ Kool Herc.

49:55.367 --> 49:56.911
That's the Big Bang right there.

50:05.961 --> 50:08.464
- Is he dead?
- What's wrong with him?

50:08.547 --> 50:11.425
- He's overdosing!
- Man. He's turning blue.

50:11.508 --> 50:12.927
Just listen to me.
We've gotta shock his system.

50:13.010 --> 50:14.678
Mylene, get ice from the freezer.

50:14.762 --> 50:18.140
Mylene-- Shit. Yolanda, get ice, now!

50:23.896 --> 50:26.607
- Yo, what you doing?
- Hand me the ice, quick!

50:28.567 --> 50:30.069
Come on.

50:30.527 --> 50:34.865
Come on, come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on... Come on.

50:37.284 --> 50:40.204
- We gotta call 911.
- Hold up. Just give him a minute.

50:42.206 --> 50:44.917
Hey, honey.

50:45.000 --> 50:47.294
I was meaning to call you.

50:54.385 --> 50:56.345
Yo, let's get in there.

51:06.355 --> 51:07.815
Holy shit.

51:08.524 --> 51:10.442
Yo, don't look now.

51:10.526 --> 51:12.903
That must be the King of Cassettes
right there.

51:21.620 --> 51:23.706
All right.
He's gonna meet E to do the deal.

51:23.789 --> 51:25.708
Yo, you sure you're ready to do this?

51:25.791 --> 51:29.169
Don't you gotta wake up early in the
morning, do that 9-to-5 internship thing?

51:29.253 --> 51:31.338
I don't wanna keep a working man
out too late.

51:31.422 --> 51:33.716
All right. Forget you then.
Where's the subway at?

51:33.799 --> 51:37.094
No, I'm playing with you.
We on Get Down Brothers time. Let's go.

51:38.637 --> 51:40.973
Is this all that's left
of my uncle's money, Jackie?

51:41.056 --> 51:43.934
I had to--
I had some background to pay,

51:44.018 --> 51:47.187
-and I put the rest of it in the bank.
-Is he gonna live?

51:47.271 --> 51:49.356
-Yeah.
-All right. Let's go then.

51:51.108 --> 51:52.276
- Mylene.
- No.

51:52.359 --> 51:55.738
-Fuck you, Jackie.
-Wait, man. Wait, Mylene. Mylene.

51:55.821 --> 51:58.282
I got it. I got it. I got it.
I got the song.

51:58.365 --> 51:59.533
I got the tune. I got it.

51:59.616 --> 52:03.037
Just, please, I swear to God.
I have the tune. I swear on my life.

52:03.120 --> 52:04.038
Please don't leave.

52:04.121 --> 52:07.082
Here. Listen.

52:18.927 --> 52:21.764
It's a terrific song.
You kids are gonna love this tune.

52:21.847 --> 52:25.142
It's like, this-- Forget about all this.
This is nothing.

52:25.225 --> 52:28.395
This is just nerves.
It's just nerves of creation. It's just--

52:28.479 --> 52:30.064
You know, it's not pretty, it's real.

52:31.231 --> 52:33.650
But you know, who said art was easy?

52:33.734 --> 52:34.943
Okay.

52:38.739 --> 52:41.867
Yeah, but how's the rest go?

52:43.285 --> 52:44.828
How does the rest go?

52:45.913 --> 52:48.415
-You're a tough cookie. What's your name?
-Regina.

52:48.499 --> 52:51.418
Well, Regina,
I'm like Paul Masson, all right?

52:51.502 --> 52:55.381
I will serve no song before its time.

52:55.464 --> 52:58.634
Okay? This-- I'm just putting
the finishing touches on this.

52:59.385 --> 53:02.346
Right, well if you got it,
then we gotta go up to <i>Hijos Boricuas</i>

53:02.429 --> 53:04.139
and you gotta show it to my uncle.

53:17.528 --> 53:19.363
I don't want you to go tonight.

53:20.697 --> 53:23.200
But it's your brother's fundraiser
for the church.

53:23.283 --> 53:24.493
One of us has to go.

53:25.411 --> 53:29.164
And this is for the church as well
I suppose? Yeah.

53:29.248 --> 53:32.292
I found it in the cupboard...
behind a can of beans.

53:32.376 --> 53:34.420
-Ramon, I can explain.
-No, no. No need to.

53:34.503 --> 53:36.964
No, no, no.
No, it's all very clear to me now.

53:37.047 --> 53:39.758
Francisco said you wouldn't accept
the money from him.

53:39.842 --> 53:43.846
And... we need the money, Ramon.

53:43.929 --> 53:46.473
He said I should put it
in the collection a little at a time.

53:46.557 --> 53:49.601
And this happened the night
that you were alone with him?

53:49.685 --> 53:52.396
-The night of the blackout?
-We weren't alone.

53:52.479 --> 53:54.356
It just-- No one else was there.

53:54.440 --> 53:58.444
I went to confront him about Mylene
and the mess in the church.

53:58.527 --> 54:00.237
Because he was behind it.

54:00.320 --> 54:02.322
Mylene, acting out like that.

54:02.406 --> 54:04.116
She just wants to sing.

54:05.033 --> 54:07.911
-And I want her home.
-And she will be.

54:07.995 --> 54:10.164
My brother, for the time being,

54:10.247 --> 54:13.959
he is not welcome in this house
or at the church.

54:14.042 --> 54:15.627
Are we clear about that, my dear?

54:15.711 --> 54:17.754
Without your brother,
we'd have no church.

54:17.838 --> 54:20.674
Better a failed church than a soiled nest.

54:20.757 --> 54:23.886
-What's that supposed to mean?
-It means get your things,

54:23.969 --> 54:26.346
and then you and I are gonna
return this money to my brother,

54:26.430 --> 54:29.725
and then... I am going
to lay down the law to him.

54:29.808 --> 54:33.145
Your brother loves you very much,
Ramon.

54:33.228 --> 54:35.981
He should love me less
and respect me more.

54:43.489 --> 54:45.616
I thought that was pretty good.

54:45.699 --> 54:48.827
I think that's all his broke ass got.

54:48.911 --> 54:50.537
What you think, Mylene?

54:51.121 --> 54:52.915
I think I'm an idiot.

54:52.998 --> 54:55.125
He was my only chance,
and look at him.

54:56.418 --> 55:00.172
And, Regina, how did you even know
how to do all that back there?

55:02.508 --> 55:04.718
My mom used to do that for my dad.

55:05.260 --> 55:07.804
-I'm sorry.
-Don't be sorry.

55:09.306 --> 55:13.769
I just learned, sometimes,
you gotta take some bad with the good.

55:13.852 --> 55:15.270
<i>¿Tú sabes?</i>

55:15.979 --> 55:18.190

55:18.273 --> 55:19.816
No, you couldn't.

55:20.859 --> 55:23.153
And whether or not Jackie has a song...

-I've been deep in the creative process.

57:44.169 --> 57:46.380
- That's what you calling it?
- Yeah.

57:46.463 --> 57:48.924
You do have a song for my niece, right?

57:49.007 --> 57:52.094
'Cause you got a lot of my money.

57:52.177 --> 57:55.013
Yes, I got a song. Yeah, I got it.

57:55.097 --> 57:57.015
- Two hundred.
- Two hundred?

57:57.099 --> 58:00.394
I ain't never heard no one paying more
than 100 for a bootleg Flash tape.

58:00.477 --> 58:03.689
-Let me hear it first.
-It's the same one you got last time.

58:06.274 --> 58:07.776
Now what?

58:09.069 --> 58:11.029
Now we fuck his face up.

58:12.114 --> 58:13.532
The fuck is that?

58:13.615 --> 58:15.993
A sword. So, look.
I'm gonna go in and mark him up.

58:16.076 --> 58:18.286
Let him know what he can
and can't do to the Grandmaster.

58:18.370 --> 58:21.331
Then I need you to come in
and get the tape on my count.

58:23.583 --> 58:24.584
No.

58:25.711 --> 58:28.130
-Yo, what you mean "no"?
-I'm not doing this.

58:28.213 --> 58:31.925
We are in the streets, bro.
What we do is in the street.

58:32.009 --> 58:34.428
And in the street, shit happens.

58:35.012 --> 58:38.140
Now, you gonna be a little pussy-whipped,
punk-ass internship bitch,

-No. Put that fucking thing away.

58:51.653 --> 58:54.573
- My passengers call me Turtle.
- Turtle?

58:54.656 --> 58:57.659
Turtle, because I drive
my OJ too fast, man. Get it?

59:18.138 --> 59:20.515
We go from the East to the West,
from the West to the East,

59:20.599 --> 59:22.768
Little Zip's car service
is the best you'll see.

59:22.851 --> 59:26.271
From the East to the West, we'll charge
you less if you sell that tape to me.

59:26.354 --> 59:28.148
Hell, no. It's mine.

59:28.648 --> 59:30.734
- Hey,<i> mi gente. </i> We wanna hear this song.
- Yeah, man.

59:30.817 --> 59:32.819
It's not fair for me
to play the song right now

59:32.903 --> 59:34.780
- 'cause I don't have my band with me.
- Well,

59:34.863 --> 59:36.698
what about my boys here?
They're pretty good.

59:36.782 --> 59:39.659
<i>Luisito, no te quiero ofender pero,</i>
didn't you do a whole studio session

59:39.743 --> 59:42.037
with Jackie here? For Tito, right?

59:42.120 --> 59:43.538
- Luis.
- What's up, man?

59:43.622 --> 59:45.749
<i>-¿Qué pasó? </i> How you doing?
-Hey, how long ago was that?

59:45.832 --> 59:47.709
-That was 1965.
-1965, man.

59:47.793 --> 59:49.169
-You still married?
-Yeah.

59:49.252 --> 59:51.213
Jackie, Jackie, piano's right here.

59:52.923 --> 59:56.802
-Is this piano in tune?
-I would say it's in tune. Yeah.

59:56.885 --> 59:59.763
Excuse me, could I get a J&B
on the rocks, please.

59:59.846 --> 01:00:01.932
And then, um... And then...

01:00:04.101 --> 01:00:07.062
So... So... So...

01:00:08.563 --> 01:00:10.315
Um, I need an ashtray.

01:00:12.150 --> 01:00:14.528
Play the fucking song, Jackie.

01:00:14.611 --> 01:00:16.363
-I got $150.
-Fuck off.

01:00:16.446 --> 01:00:18.782
This shit is mine.
I got your money right here.

01:00:19.533 --> 01:00:22.953
- Three hundred! Three hundred!
- And I got 50.

01:00:23.036 --> 01:00:26.373
Yo, yo, gentlemen.
I can see that emotions are running high.

01:00:26.456 --> 01:00:28.416
But check it out.
My associates here and I,

01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:30.627
belong to a socially-minded consortium
of OJ drivers concerned

01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:33.713
with the ass-poor working conditions in
the typical Bronx-based hire limousine.

01:00:33.797 --> 01:00:36.174
But also with the skyrocketing cost
of living that's forced

01:00:36.258 --> 01:00:39.594
the typical OJ driver to now resort
to bootlegging the venerated DJ kings.

01:00:41.054 --> 01:00:42.848
- What the fuck?!
- Fuck.

01:00:43.390 --> 01:00:45.725
- Run!
- Come on! Go, go, go!

01:00:46.351 --> 01:00:47.435
Go!

01:00:49.020 --> 01:00:50.730
I'm gonna get you, motherfucker!

01:00:50.814 --> 01:00:52.566
Yo, Zeke, over here, let's go.

01:01:31.021 --> 01:01:32.814
Shit!

01:01:32.898 --> 01:01:34.482
- Yo, come on!
- Move! Go!

01:01:39.696 --> 01:01:40.530
Come here!

01:01:54.711 --> 01:01:57.214
-Hey, look. It's the fake-down bitches.
-What the fuck?

01:01:58.256 --> 01:01:59.549
Get 'em!

01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:27.702
Boy... you must not know where you at.
