WEBVTT

01:48.483 --> 01:49.484
No!

02:58.094 --> 03:00.221
Christ, Helen.

03:00.263 --> 03:02.974
How many times
do I have to tell you
to take it easy on the brakes?

03:03.016 --> 03:04.434
She came from nowhere.

03:04.475 --> 03:05.435
What was it?

03:05.476 --> 03:06.895
It was a naked woman.

03:06.936 --> 03:08.521
I said you should drive.

03:08.563 --> 03:10.440
- Oh, you didn't--
- I told you she's underneath.

03:10.481 --> 03:12.692
You didn't say that.

03:12.734 --> 03:13.818
Here, hold Molly.

03:19.908 --> 03:21.993
Christ. Bring a blanket.

03:27.207 --> 03:28.833
- Alright.
- Is she dead?

03:28.875 --> 03:30.376
No.
But if we don't get her

03:30.418 --> 03:31.794
to the hospital right now,
she will be.

03:31.836 --> 03:33.671
We gotta get her in the van.
Come on.

03:49.812 --> 03:52.315
Come on, let's get her in.
She's lost a lot of blood.

04:21.803 --> 04:23.304
Alright, what have we got?

04:23.346 --> 04:25.056
- I can't find a vein.
- Sheesh.

04:25.098 --> 04:27.684
All these needle marks,
all these veins are flat.

04:27.725 --> 04:28.977
Ah, shit.

04:29.894 --> 04:32.146
I really don't wanna have
to do a carotid.

04:32.689 --> 04:33.856
There's nothing.

04:36.067 --> 04:37.193
Do it.

04:46.160 --> 04:47.620
It's okay.

04:47.662 --> 04:49.289
Okay, hold her down.

04:49.330 --> 04:51.541
Hold her down, hold her down.

04:51.582 --> 04:53.418
- It's okay.
- He's coming!

04:53.459 --> 04:55.336
- Sweetie...
- Nobody's coming. No.

04:55.378 --> 04:57.171
No, no, no, no, no, no.
What's your name?

04:57.213 --> 04:59.215
- Oh, he's coming!
- It's okay. It's okay.

05:00.425 --> 05:02.760
You're alright,
you're gonna be okay.

05:04.220 --> 05:06.514
What other drugs
have you taken?

05:08.891 --> 05:11.769
Oh, lord... Alright.

05:12.854 --> 05:16.316
Let's keep her sedated
and let's get a look
at these lacerations.

05:16.357 --> 05:18.651
Looks like she's gone
through a meat grinder.

05:18.693 --> 05:21.988
Draw some blood
and get it back to me
as quick as possible.

05:36.377 --> 05:38.546
Nice ass. Give me
a grab, will you?

05:38.588 --> 05:40.340
Fuck off!

05:48.348 --> 05:49.766
- Hey!
- I really admire

05:49.807 --> 05:51.851
- them bodacious jugs.
- Go find

05:51.893 --> 05:53.561
- some fucking other ones.
- Hey, punk!

05:53.603 --> 05:55.188
You feeling lucky? Are ya?

05:55.229 --> 05:56.522
Go ahead,
touch her again.

05:56.564 --> 05:57.899
- Do it.
- Wha--?

05:57.940 --> 05:59.817
Damn, Lisa, what's gotten
into you?

05:59.859 --> 06:01.361
Yeah, what kind of hooker
are you anyway, lady?

06:01.402 --> 06:02.820
Not one you can afford.

06:02.862 --> 06:05.073
Hey, hey, back off. Come on.

06:05.114 --> 06:06.199
Do you see what I deal with?

06:06.240 --> 06:07.492
Oh, come on,

06:07.533 --> 06:08.868
just a little titty.

06:09.369 --> 06:10.620
I got money.

06:11.162 --> 06:12.663
How much
will ten bucks get me?

06:13.331 --> 06:15.583
You can get fucked,
but not by us.

06:15.625 --> 06:17.877
Oh!

06:17.919 --> 06:20.004
- How do you deal
with that all the time?
- Take me to Titty Town!

06:20.046 --> 06:21.714
- Okay.
-  - Come on, pull those girls out.

06:21.756 --> 06:23.299
- Sadie. Hey, hey, hey!
- Ow!

06:23.341 --> 06:24.550
- No, no, no.
Come here. Come here.
- Ahh!

06:24.592 --> 06:26.552
Hey, hey, hey, come,
come, come. Come on.

06:26.594 --> 06:29.597
Every fucking time.

06:32.183 --> 06:36.479
It was just off a country road
near some tracks, I think.

06:39.065 --> 06:40.775
How fast were you going?

06:40.817 --> 06:42.652
Well, I was going
the speed limit.

06:42.693 --> 06:44.862
Why was she driving?
Were you drinking?

06:44.904 --> 06:47.573
- No. Just--
- Okay, was she drinking?

06:47.615 --> 06:48.908
No.

06:48.950 --> 06:50.284
So what meds are you on?

06:50.326 --> 06:52.120
- What?
- Excuse me?

06:52.662 --> 06:54.455
Oh, honey.

06:55.164 --> 06:58.167
I think I have some concealer
in here that'll help with that.

06:58.209 --> 06:59.710
Yeah, right.

06:59.752 --> 07:01.587
Oh, what about
a smoke instead?

07:01.629 --> 07:03.673
- Oh, yeah, here.
- Ugh.

07:07.677 --> 07:08.845
Actually...

07:09.720 --> 07:10.847
take the whole pack.

07:11.973 --> 07:12.932
Really?

07:12.974 --> 07:14.308
- Mm-hmm.
- You sure?

07:15.852 --> 07:16.853
Yeah.

07:17.478 --> 07:19.856
No time like the present.

07:26.612 --> 07:28.906
Hey, have you thought
about my offer?

07:29.615 --> 07:31.200
I can see you tomorrow.

07:33.244 --> 07:35.455
I don't know. I...

07:36.164 --> 07:38.708
I wouldn't even have
anything proper to wear.

07:38.749 --> 07:40.710
Mm. You're about my size.

07:40.751 --> 07:43.504
Why don't you stop by
my place tomorrow
and you can borrow something?

07:43.546 --> 07:45.214
You're not gonna make me wear
something like this, are you?

07:45.256 --> 07:47.925
No, actually,
I have something perfect.

07:47.967 --> 07:50.928
And then if you get the job,
it'll fit you for a uniform.

07:51.429 --> 07:52.597
Uniform?

07:52.638 --> 07:54.557
God, Lisa.

07:54.599 --> 07:57.185
The only uniform I've ever worn
is an orange jumpsuit.

07:57.226 --> 07:59.270
Hey, opportunities like this,

07:59.312 --> 08:00.897
they don't come around
every day.

08:00.938 --> 08:03.024
I know you don't wanna be
walking the streets like this

08:03.065 --> 08:04.609
when you're 50.

08:06.402 --> 08:08.029
Lucky if I make it to 35.

08:12.241 --> 08:13.993
- Ugh.
- Here comes the party pooper.

08:14.035 --> 08:15.578
- Hmm.
- Uh...

08:15.620 --> 08:18.164
I-I really don't know.
I mean, it happened so fast.

08:18.206 --> 08:20.416
- We're not from around here.
- And she came out of nowhere.

08:30.843 --> 08:32.094
Evening, ladies.

08:34.180 --> 08:36.724
Sadie, what happened here?

08:37.433 --> 08:38.684
Nothing.

08:38.726 --> 08:40.269
One day, it's not
gonna be nothing.

08:40.311 --> 08:41.771
There's some bad dudes
out there.

08:41.812 --> 08:43.105
I hate to see you get hurt.

08:43.689 --> 08:44.857
Thank you.

08:45.775 --> 08:47.693
You. You know the drill.
Get in the back.

08:48.236 --> 08:49.237
Seriously?

08:49.737 --> 08:51.155
Don't make me
get out of this car.

08:54.158 --> 08:55.159
Ah...

08:56.744 --> 08:59.121
- You don't have anything sharp?
- Are you kidding me right now?

09:00.081 --> 09:01.666
You are kidding me, right?

09:01.707 --> 09:03.292
- With anything back here?
- Hey! Hey!

09:03.334 --> 09:05.336
- Hey, you do that again...
- Watch your hands.

09:05.378 --> 09:06.879
...and I'm gonna throw
the cuffs on you.

09:06.921 --> 09:08.839
- Oh, my God. Ouch!
- Watch your head.

09:08.881 --> 09:10.091
Hey, Officer Jack.

09:11.050 --> 09:12.718
Want some extra company?

09:12.760 --> 09:14.387
We're offering
a two-for-one
special tonight.

09:14.428 --> 09:17.098
Ah, this one's
all I can handle,
thank you.

09:17.807 --> 09:18.933
Your loss.

09:35.783 --> 09:38.077
Will you let me
out of this car right now?

09:38.786 --> 09:40.663
If you give me
a kiss, I will.

09:40.705 --> 09:42.498
How about I give you
a punch in the mouth?

09:45.459 --> 09:48.671
- Oh. Oh, you're so not funny.
- I'm hilarious.

09:48.713 --> 09:50.464
Oh, I'm glad
you think you are.

09:50.506 --> 09:52.258
Everyone else thinks
you're a bore.

09:52.300 --> 09:54.302
You mind telling me
what you're doing out here

09:54.343 --> 09:55.928
dressed as a mariachi woman?

09:55.970 --> 09:57.805
It's my hooker look.

09:58.222 --> 10:01.267
You think dudes wanna
hook up with women
that are dressed as mariachis?

10:01.309 --> 10:02.560
It's not--

10:03.102 --> 10:04.812
It's not mariachi, I--

10:04.854 --> 10:06.772
I came to talk to Sadie
and try to get her to go

10:06.814 --> 10:08.190
to that interview for tomorrow.

10:09.400 --> 10:11.402
I still don't get it.

10:11.444 --> 10:13.362
I feel like
I'm more relatable
to the girls

10:13.404 --> 10:16.324
if I don't look like
a soccer mom.

10:19.243 --> 10:20.745
No!

10:24.248 --> 10:26.292
Please, no.

10:26.334 --> 10:28.210
Now you just keep
an eye on her.

10:30.796 --> 10:31.839
Please...

10:34.008 --> 10:35.926
I think soccer mom's hot.

10:37.178 --> 10:38.554
So, how about that kiss?

10:38.596 --> 10:40.931
Oh, pfft. You got
a one-track mind.

10:40.973 --> 10:44.226
Well, goddamn, Lisa,
it's been two months.

10:45.144 --> 10:46.520
Speaking of which,

10:47.396 --> 10:48.939
you coming back home or not?

10:49.732 --> 10:50.858
Mmm.

10:52.360 --> 10:53.444
That's it?

10:54.070 --> 10:55.446
You're not gonna say anything?

10:56.322 --> 10:57.907
Normally, I can't
get you to shut up.

10:57.948 --> 10:59.867
And...
Now you're going
all silent on me?

10:59.909 --> 11:01.869
Oh, whoa, okay.

11:01.911 --> 11:03.954
Well, oh, now I'm really not
gonna say anything.

11:03.996 --> 11:05.915
I'll just sit back here
with my mouth shut.

11:05.956 --> 11:07.416
I'm not gonna say a word.

11:07.458 --> 11:10.252
Nothing, nada, zip.

11:10.294 --> 11:12.129
Won't even say anything
about your hair.

11:12.630 --> 11:14.131
What the fuck about my hair?

11:14.173 --> 11:16.092
Is that Just For Men?

11:16.133 --> 11:17.760
No, but my--

11:17.802 --> 11:19.428
I mean, I did a little, but...

11:19.470 --> 11:21.430
Shut up.

11:23.391 --> 11:25.101
Shoot, I gotta go. That's Joe.

11:25.142 --> 11:27.311
- Gotta get to work.
- Absolute nonsense.

11:27.812 --> 11:29.230
Hey, let me out.

11:30.523 --> 11:31.774
- I'm serious.
- Alright.

11:31.816 --> 11:33.984
I gotta go. Thank you.

11:35.820 --> 11:37.905
Looks like it did when I was 20.

11:38.489 --> 11:40.491
Okay, let's not make
this difficult.

11:40.533 --> 11:43.661
Just put one foot
in front of the other
and walk the line.

11:43.703 --> 11:46.414
Alright, just do
what he says, Helen.
Let's get this done with.

11:47.832 --> 11:48.916
Jesus Christ.

11:56.173 --> 11:57.842
She's a lost cause.

11:58.426 --> 12:02.596
Sadly, I see these type
of situations every time
I'm out here.

12:02.638 --> 12:03.889
Shame on you.

12:03.931 --> 12:05.766
She's somebody's daughter.

12:05.808 --> 12:07.643
Well, I'm sure
she used to be.

12:22.950 --> 12:24.785
Hey, thanks for coming.
We brought her in.

12:24.827 --> 12:26.954
She's had multiple lacerations.

12:26.996 --> 12:29.790
She's high
as a kite, with no ID,

12:29.832 --> 12:32.334
and had this real
acrid smell to her.

12:32.376 --> 12:33.586
And she's, uh...

12:34.545 --> 12:36.589
- She's really freaked out.
- Okay.

12:38.632 --> 12:40.426
- Doing some role-playing
or what?

12:40.468 --> 12:43.345
Well, uh, kind of.
Helps to fit in
when you look the part.

12:46.390 --> 12:48.392
Oh, shit. Oh.

12:52.188 --> 12:53.355
Oh, it's...

13:01.822 --> 13:03.199
Hi. It's okay.

13:03.824 --> 13:04.909
You're okay.

13:06.368 --> 13:08.954
My name's Lisa.
I'm with Social Services.

13:08.996 --> 13:11.248
I'm not gonna hurt you, okay?
I'm here to help you.

13:11.290 --> 13:12.708
Can you tell me your name?

13:14.210 --> 13:17.379
It's okay. How about...
Can you just nod
your head for me?

13:18.255 --> 13:20.382
You know... Do you know
who did this to you?

13:20.424 --> 13:23.260
No, no, no, it's okay.
Shh, shh, shh.

13:23.302 --> 13:25.888
You are so safe here.
You can trust me, okay?

13:25.930 --> 13:28.599
Take my hand. We're gonna
come out nice and slow.

13:28.641 --> 13:30.851
Gotta get you back
into bed, okay?

13:30.893 --> 13:33.437
You're okay. You're safe.
Let's go, nice and easy.

13:33.479 --> 13:36.065
- Nice and easy. It's okay.
- It's okay. It's okay.

13:36.106 --> 13:38.776
You're safe.
You're safe. You're fine.

13:43.113 --> 13:45.407
- Oh, my God!
- Somebody sound Code One!

13:54.416 --> 13:55.835
No.

14:15.396 --> 14:17.565
Oh, Jesus Christ.

14:18.274 --> 14:19.567
Come on. You don't have
to see this.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.235
- Oh, my God.
- You don't have
to see this. Don't look.

14:21.694 --> 14:22.945
Just don't look. Come on.

14:23.696 --> 14:24.947
Come on.

14:26.407 --> 14:27.449
Come on.

15:06.780 --> 15:08.741
Wait, what?

15:08.782 --> 15:10.784
- Right?
- What a nice surprise.

15:11.493 --> 15:13.454
I was wondering
if there was
any information

15:13.495 --> 15:14.872
on last night's stabbing.

15:14.914 --> 15:16.498
- Uh, we're on it.
- Lisa.

15:16.540 --> 15:18.500
Chief, hi.

15:19.460 --> 15:22.004
Ray of sunshine
in our dingy little office.

15:22.046 --> 15:23.672
Anything on that girl
last night?

15:23.714 --> 15:26.467
Street rat,
clearly drugged up,

15:26.508 --> 15:28.594
gets killed
by traffic accident.

15:28.636 --> 15:30.512
With multiple knife wounds?

15:32.348 --> 15:33.557
Lisa.

15:34.058 --> 15:36.185
We're on it. Let us do our jobs.

15:36.226 --> 15:37.519
Did you know her?

15:37.561 --> 15:39.980
Yeah, she had
a familiar face, but, uh...

15:40.898 --> 15:43.943
I don't know. These, uh,
these girls are kind of
tough nuts to crack.

15:43.984 --> 15:46.612
Maybe I'll go over
to Star's tonight.
I can ask around.

15:46.654 --> 15:48.530
Don't go nuts.
You're drawing me, Lisa.

15:48.572 --> 15:50.157
A single vehicle incident

15:50.199 --> 15:53.160
involving an unidentified
female pedestrian

15:53.202 --> 15:56.455
resulted in a tragic
and horrific accident
late last night.

15:59.750 --> 16:02.962
Oh, my God, you look amazing.

16:03.003 --> 16:04.838
Ugh, what if they don't like me?

16:04.880 --> 16:06.924
- I don't want you
to be disappointed.
- No, no, shh, shh, stop.

16:06.966 --> 16:09.176
Don't be nervous, okay?
These are friends of mine.

16:09.218 --> 16:11.971
You just go in there,
just be yourself.
That's all you have to do.

16:12.513 --> 16:14.223
- You got it.
- Okay. Okay.

16:15.140 --> 16:17.309
Okay, but what if
they do like me?
I mean, Lisa,

16:17.351 --> 16:19.103
- I don't know.
- Hey, I already told you.

16:19.144 --> 16:20.813
Don't worry about anything.
You can stay with me

16:20.854 --> 16:22.231
until you get
your first paycheck.

16:22.272 --> 16:23.482
Okay?

16:23.524 --> 16:24.900
Nothing to be nervous about.

16:24.942 --> 16:26.235
Go knock 'em dead.

16:26.276 --> 16:27.903
Yes.

16:27.945 --> 16:30.114
Thank you.

16:31.532 --> 16:33.742
- Good luck.
- If anyone has any information

16:33.784 --> 16:37.913
on her identity, please call
the police department
at 555-71...

16:52.261 --> 16:54.263
- Hey, Jack.
- Hey.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.557
So you're working late again?

16:56.598 --> 16:58.976
Yeah, I got
a lot of paperwork.

16:59.018 --> 17:00.978
Is there anything
I can help you with?

17:01.020 --> 17:02.646
Nah. It's all in my head.

17:02.688 --> 17:04.732
I just got to get it out
on the computer.

17:04.773 --> 17:06.817
I can help you clear
your head.

17:07.901 --> 17:09.403
I heard you guys split.

17:10.237 --> 17:11.739
She must have been crazy

17:11.780 --> 17:14.033
to let a good man
like you get away.

17:14.074 --> 17:16.326
Not exactly. We, uh...

17:16.368 --> 17:18.037
We're trying to work it out.

17:18.078 --> 17:19.413
Hmm.

17:19.913 --> 17:21.957
Well, if you ever need
a shoulder to cry on...

17:23.292 --> 17:24.877
Thank you, Silvia.

17:24.918 --> 17:27.588
That shoulder
could be in uniform.

17:28.505 --> 17:30.883
Or it could be
in absolutely nothing...

17:30.924 --> 17:32.426
...but Chanel No. 5.

17:34.386 --> 17:37.806
Well, that is certainly
an intoxicating offer,

17:37.848 --> 17:40.267
but I'm not ready--
Oh, oh, oh, no.

17:42.186 --> 17:44.313
I'm not ready to give up
on her just yet.

17:47.316 --> 17:49.276
Okay. Well...

17:50.736 --> 17:52.112
if you change your mind...

17:53.655 --> 17:55.115
offer still stands.

18:00.829 --> 18:02.664
It's not the only thing
standing.

18:26.146 --> 18:27.523
Hey, girls.

18:27.564 --> 18:29.525
- Hey.
- Hi, Lisa.

18:29.566 --> 18:32.444
We heard about that girl
that got sliced up and run down.

18:33.237 --> 18:34.905
- Fucking terrifying.
- Mm-hmm.

18:34.947 --> 18:36.281
What's your old man's
take on it?

18:36.323 --> 18:38.033
- Yeah?
- I'm getting the blow off.

18:38.075 --> 18:39.368
Did any of you girls know her?

18:39.409 --> 18:40.869
She wasn't one of us.

18:40.911 --> 18:43.372
Must have rolled in
from some other gutter.

18:43.413 --> 18:45.499
- Unlucky gutter.
- What's it gonna be, ladies?

18:45.541 --> 18:48.627
If you're sitting at my table,
you gotta crack open
those coin purses.

18:48.669 --> 18:50.337
- Star!
- Come on, Star!

18:50.379 --> 18:52.840
Hey, lay off, Star.
You know that we keep
this place running.

18:52.881 --> 18:54.258
- Uh-huh.
- Amen!

18:54.299 --> 18:55.843
Hey, it's alright, Star.
This round's on me.

18:55.884 --> 18:57.052
Whatever they normally get.

18:57.094 --> 19:00.097
Yay! Lisa!

19:00.139 --> 19:01.640
What they always get
when you're paying,

19:01.682 --> 19:03.475
or what they sometimes get
when you're not here?

19:03.517 --> 19:05.185
Come on!

19:05.227 --> 19:06.562
What they usually get.

19:06.603 --> 19:07.688
How about for you?

19:07.729 --> 19:09.106
I heard you had
a hell of a night.

19:09.148 --> 19:10.983
How about a double?

19:11.024 --> 19:13.777
- Damn, Star!
What's wrong with you?
- Seriously?

19:14.403 --> 19:15.612
- For real?
- Oh!

19:15.654 --> 19:18.490
Sorry, Lisa. I run a bar. Habit.

19:18.532 --> 19:20.075
No, no, no sweat.

19:20.701 --> 19:22.703
So, anything on the girl?

19:23.829 --> 19:26.248
Come on, any of you guys
see her last night?

19:26.748 --> 19:28.250
Know where she might
have gotten picked up?

19:28.292 --> 19:29.626
Who she partied with?

19:33.672 --> 19:35.174
Nothing? Come on, girls.

19:35.215 --> 19:37.384
I know you're not always
on the up and up with me,

19:37.426 --> 19:38.552
and I get it.

19:39.261 --> 19:40.929
I'm not here to cause
any trouble.

19:40.971 --> 19:43.599
Or bore us
with your AA antidotes.

19:43.640 --> 19:45.434
- Shawanda!
- Fair enough. Alright, fine.

19:45.475 --> 19:47.394
I just wanted to find
out what happened

19:47.436 --> 19:49.563
so it doesn't happen again
to any of you.

19:49.605 --> 19:50.689
You see?

19:52.065 --> 19:53.567
So, anything?

19:56.862 --> 19:59.031
Hey, how about you?

19:59.990 --> 20:02.534
You know anything
about that girl
that got killed last night?

20:02.576 --> 20:03.660
Me?

20:09.833 --> 20:11.585
That one? Fucking nutcase.

20:11.627 --> 20:13.545
I wouldn't believe a word
that comes out of her mouth.

20:13.587 --> 20:14.838
She's a tweaker.

20:27.643 --> 20:29.561
Welcome. Hell, yeah.

20:52.501 --> 20:53.752
Hi. How are you?

20:53.794 --> 20:55.170
Listen, girl.

20:55.212 --> 20:56.922
We appreciate your concern,

20:56.964 --> 20:59.049
but she's not the first

20:59.091 --> 21:01.426
- and she won't be the last.
- Mm?

21:01.468 --> 21:03.428
Girls have been
disappearing around here

21:03.470 --> 21:05.722
- for years.
- Yep.

21:06.974 --> 21:08.809
And nobody gives a damn.

21:09.476 --> 21:11.937
Are you telling me
that other girls
have been killed?

21:11.979 --> 21:13.480
We have been talking
to the cops

21:13.522 --> 21:15.274
- till we're blue in the face.
- Mm-hmm.

21:15.315 --> 21:18.568
- They don't care.
- All we get at best is a shrug.

21:18.610 --> 21:22.447
Listen, they don't give
a shit about us.
They think we got it coming

21:22.489 --> 21:23.699
- or something.
- Mm-hmm.

22:19.796 --> 22:21.548
Oh, hell, yeah, man.

22:22.215 --> 22:24.968
You got more of this?
I'm your girl.

22:36.688 --> 22:38.607
Whatever you want, Daddy.

22:39.775 --> 22:41.109
That's my game.

22:41.860 --> 22:44.196
"Anything Kate," they call me.

22:46.615 --> 22:48.992
Could you move over
just a little bit, please?

22:49.034 --> 22:50.702
What the fuck?

22:51.828 --> 22:53.497
I said I would do
whatever you want.

22:53.538 --> 22:54.956
You just gotta ask.

23:00.045 --> 23:02.714
Sorry, I'm a little bit
of a clean freak.

23:04.549 --> 23:05.759
Clean freak.

23:06.635 --> 23:07.969
That's funny.

23:22.317 --> 23:23.819
You're a funny...

23:24.736 --> 23:27.072
funny fucking guy.
You know that?

23:28.698 --> 23:31.493
Fuckin' serious?
You're fuckin' nuts.

23:33.328 --> 23:35.080
Oh, my pretty
little piggy.

23:35.997 --> 23:37.332
I'm dead serious.

23:39.209 --> 23:40.377
Shit.

23:45.048 --> 23:46.550
This stuff's good.

23:49.302 --> 23:50.429
It's good.

23:56.893 --> 23:58.228
What the fuck are you doing?

23:58.687 --> 24:00.105
What?

24:00.147 --> 24:01.773
W-what-- what's the fucking
knife in your hand?

24:01.815 --> 24:03.567
- What knife?
- Fucking knife.

24:04.985 --> 24:07.696
Darling, this isn't a knife.

24:07.737 --> 24:09.072
This is your salvation.

24:09.114 --> 24:11.491
No, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no, please.

24:11.533 --> 24:12.909
Please, look-- I'll get you off.

24:12.951 --> 24:14.995
Let me do anything.
Stop, please.

24:16.496 --> 24:18.081
You already have.

25:38.620 --> 25:39.913
Thank you.

26:06.273 --> 26:07.732
Okay.

26:09.526 --> 26:11.695
We got 50 links...

26:12.654 --> 26:13.822
forty pork...

26:15.865 --> 26:17.659
two Squealer's specials.

26:20.203 --> 26:22.289
Fresh killer sausages.

26:24.541 --> 26:26.543
This place never disappoints.

26:32.716 --> 26:33.925
Thank you.

26:36.803 --> 26:38.722
You know, it's all in the cut.

26:53.945 --> 26:56.281
Women get reported
missing all the time

26:56.323 --> 26:58.074
and most of them
turn out to be nothing.

26:58.575 --> 27:01.661
These girls on the street,
they're mostly just drifters.

27:01.703 --> 27:03.788
Well, that doesn't mean
that we should just ignore them.

27:03.830 --> 27:07.459
We need to put
our energy into people
who really deserve it, Lisa.

27:07.500 --> 27:09.169
Not people who choose

27:09.210 --> 27:11.046
a certain way of life
and then end up dead
in a ditch...

27:11.087 --> 27:12.547
- "Choose a way of life..."
- ...because of their
life choices.

27:12.589 --> 27:13.673
- Oh, shit.
-  - Not people who choose...

27:13.715 --> 27:14.883
I'm sorry but that's
the harsh truth.

27:14.924 --> 27:17.218
That is not only heartless.

27:17.260 --> 27:19.429
It's incredibly ignorant.
What, seriously?

27:19.471 --> 27:21.765
You think these women
on-on school career day decided,

27:21.806 --> 27:25.185
"Hey, I just think
I'll be a cheap hooker
and stand on a street corner

27:25.226 --> 27:27.103
where somebody might come along
and kill me."

27:27.145 --> 27:29.773
- Lisa--
- And if they do,
no one will give a damn,

27:29.814 --> 27:31.149
not even the police.

27:32.525 --> 27:34.736
Lisa, calm down. Goddamn you.

27:34.778 --> 27:36.613
Come on, man.

27:36.655 --> 27:39.658
Do-- Please tell me
that you don't agree with her.

27:39.699 --> 27:42.077
Is that why you
haven't done enough
to find this poor girl?

27:42.118 --> 27:44.245
Lisa, I know
that this is personal for you,

27:44.287 --> 27:46.623
but we don't have the manpower
on the force,

27:46.665 --> 27:48.792
and we're all just trying
to do our best.

27:48.833 --> 27:50.377
Really?

27:50.418 --> 27:53.380
Well, in the words
of Winston Churchill,

27:53.421 --> 27:55.548
"It is not enough
that we do our best.

27:55.590 --> 27:58.843
Sometimes we have to do
what is fucking required."

28:12.649 --> 28:15.985
That language is a little blunt,
even for Churchill.

28:16.027 --> 28:17.570
Alright, well,
so I embellished.

28:17.612 --> 28:18.947
Yeah, you did.

28:19.739 --> 28:21.741
There's no need
to take it out on Silvia.

28:21.783 --> 28:22.992
She didn't do anything.

28:23.827 --> 28:26.413
Right. She didn't do anything.

28:26.454 --> 28:27.789
That's the problem.

28:27.831 --> 28:29.791
None of you
are doing anything.

28:29.833 --> 28:30.834
Lisa,

28:31.543 --> 28:32.961
is this what you do? You...

28:36.673 --> 28:38.550
Uh, we have an APB out

28:38.591 --> 28:42.137
on two pink puppies
trying to escape. Do you copy?

28:42.178 --> 28:44.055
What the fuck
did you just say to me?

28:44.556 --> 28:46.641
Wanna say it a little louder
for the guys in the back?

28:46.683 --> 28:47.976
Go ahead.

28:48.017 --> 28:49.018
See,

28:49.978 --> 28:52.021
my mama told me
about your type.

28:52.063 --> 28:53.273
And what'd she say?

28:53.314 --> 28:55.692
You do whatever it takes
to get attention.

28:55.734 --> 28:57.652
And when you get
the attention you want,

28:57.694 --> 29:00.113
"What are you doing?
What are you--?" Like, come on.

29:00.155 --> 29:02.490
You see what you're doing
wearing this shit every day.

29:02.532 --> 29:04.993
I'm giving you
what you want, attention.

29:05.034 --> 29:07.871
Did your mama also ever tell you
that you got a big fucking mouth

29:07.912 --> 29:09.581
that should stay shut?

29:09.622 --> 29:11.207
'Cause let me tell you
something right now.

29:11.249 --> 29:14.294
You ever speak to me
or even about me again,

29:14.335 --> 29:17.380
I will rip your pathetic
little man-child nuts off

29:17.422 --> 29:19.799
and shove them
down your throat.

29:19.841 --> 29:21.176
You got it?

29:23.011 --> 29:24.137
All good.

29:24.888 --> 29:27.140
I got this killer sausage
here too.

29:28.141 --> 29:29.726
It's all for me.

30:33.498 --> 30:36.292
Oh, shit. No, no, no, no, no.

30:55.186 --> 30:56.479
It's so beautiful.

30:56.521 --> 30:57.814
You hear the music?

30:57.856 --> 30:58.982
- Do you hear it?
- Mm-hmm.

31:39.939 --> 31:41.190
Mind if I come in?

31:42.317 --> 31:44.277
Oh, you must have read my mind.

31:44.319 --> 31:45.778
Need something
to wake me up

31:45.820 --> 31:47.864
from this episode
of The Twilight Zone.

31:47.906 --> 31:50.909
Yeah, well, glad to see
there's one vice

31:50.950 --> 31:52.660
- that you haven't given up.
- Hmm.

31:52.702 --> 31:54.829
Besides, who else can I call

31:54.871 --> 31:57.457
at three in the morning
when I can't sleep?

31:57.498 --> 31:58.708
This is insane.

31:58.750 --> 32:00.877
There's literally dozens
of missing women

32:00.919 --> 32:03.671
and zero action
from the Dickless Tracys.

32:03.713 --> 32:05.006
Are you alright?

32:05.840 --> 32:08.801
I haven't seen you this wound up
since, uh, you know.

32:10.637 --> 32:11.721
I'm fine.

32:13.473 --> 32:15.600
When's the last time
you talked to your sponsor?

32:16.184 --> 32:18.353
Hey, I said I'm fine.

32:22.398 --> 32:25.693
Lisa, I know you care
about these girls,
but you gotta see Jack's point.

32:25.735 --> 32:29.656
A lot of them are transient,
and they don't wanna be found.

32:29.697 --> 32:31.908
I know the stats,
Joe. I'm just...

32:32.825 --> 32:34.827
telling you something
does not feel right.

32:34.869 --> 32:36.287
You saw a woman die,

32:36.329 --> 32:37.956
that's what doesn't feel right.

32:38.873 --> 32:42.627
Seeing something like that
could mess with anybody

32:42.669 --> 32:44.170
as sensitive as you.

32:45.713 --> 32:46.881
Yeah.

32:48.508 --> 32:49.717
You're probably right.

32:50.468 --> 32:51.469
Yeah.

32:53.096 --> 32:55.014
I'm sorry. I can't stop thinking

32:55.056 --> 32:57.016
about that crazy girl
with the red hair.

32:57.058 --> 32:59.352
'Cause you're swimming
on this pretty deep water here.

32:59.394 --> 33:01.062
Why don't you let
Jack handle this?

33:01.104 --> 33:02.689
It's 'cause it's like
he's brainwashed.

33:02.730 --> 33:05.775
What if there really is
someone out there killing

33:05.817 --> 33:08.361
not just one woman,
but lots of them.

33:08.403 --> 33:12.657
Okay, okay, what you got here
is a serial killer, hmm?

33:12.699 --> 33:15.451
A female serial killer
with red hair.

33:16.160 --> 33:20.081
Girl that died was a drug addict
and a hooker.

33:20.832 --> 33:25.086
And her end, God rest her soul,
is no big surprise.

33:25.712 --> 33:28.756
The wounds she suffered
were unlikely related

33:28.798 --> 33:30.216
to the other missing women.

33:30.717 --> 33:31.718
Maybe.

33:32.343 --> 33:34.929
Maybe not.
I just have a feeling.

33:36.472 --> 33:37.890
I've got a feeling too,

33:40.059 --> 33:41.394
but not a good one.

33:43.563 --> 33:45.273
Oh, uh...

33:45.314 --> 33:48.776
By the way, that acrid smell
I was telling you about?

33:48.818 --> 33:49.819
Mm-hmm.

33:50.319 --> 33:51.904
It's a farm smell.

33:51.946 --> 33:53.281
You know what's
really interesting?

33:53.322 --> 33:54.782
That couple that found her said

33:54.824 --> 33:56.951
that they were on the west side
of the city.

33:56.993 --> 33:58.327
That's farm country.

33:59.996 --> 34:01.873
You know, there's a lot
of farms out there.

34:01.914 --> 34:03.916
But you, you stay
the hell away from there.

34:03.958 --> 34:05.710
There's a lot
of weird people out there.

34:05.752 --> 34:06.753
Mm-hmm.

34:07.462 --> 34:10.590
I should know it,
I treat them every damn day.

34:10.631 --> 34:12.216
See you later, pumpkin.

34:13.468 --> 34:14.719
Bye.

34:54.300 --> 34:55.885
Sugar?

34:57.512 --> 34:59.305
It's, uh, for all my friends.

34:59.347 --> 35:03.893
Hmm. And I put
some extra in for you.

35:04.977 --> 35:06.479
- Extra?
- Mm-hmm.

35:07.647 --> 35:08.731
What for?

35:10.108 --> 35:11.818
I need you to dump
some trash for me.

35:23.663 --> 35:25.706
- Oh, wow.
- Mm-hmm.

35:25.748 --> 35:26.874
Oh.

35:27.917 --> 35:30.002
That is a big son of a bitch.

35:32.004 --> 35:33.297
Goodness gracious.

35:34.257 --> 35:35.550
What happened to him?

35:36.050 --> 35:37.135
You know.

35:38.719 --> 35:40.930
Fat guys. Their hearts give.

35:42.598 --> 35:43.891
Yeah.

35:43.933 --> 35:46.561
- Gotta imagine
this didn't help.
- Mm.

35:48.646 --> 35:49.730
Give me a sec.

36:17.133 --> 36:20.428
Okay... let's figure
this out here.

36:44.744 --> 36:47.872
Hey, buddy, could you give me--
give me a hand?

36:49.790 --> 36:51.542
Ah, you can have the whole body.

36:56.756 --> 36:59.383
You said "give me a hand."
You get it?

37:00.551 --> 37:01.552
No.

37:03.095 --> 37:05.306
Okay.

37:09.060 --> 37:10.895
Oh, come on.

37:12.396 --> 37:14.774
Okay, okay.

37:22.281 --> 37:24.450
What the hell happened
to his shoe?

37:24.492 --> 37:25.660
He bled all over it.

37:27.578 --> 37:29.497
Bled all over his shoe?

37:30.831 --> 37:31.832
How?

37:32.541 --> 37:35.586
I used it to slap
his fat face.

37:37.421 --> 37:40.675
You slapped this man in the face
with his shoe? Why?

37:41.342 --> 37:44.262
What--? What is this?
Twenty fucking questions?

37:44.303 --> 37:46.764
Yes, I used his shoe
to slap him

37:46.806 --> 37:48.182
in his fat fucking face.

37:48.224 --> 37:49.433
What does it matter?
What else was I gonna use?

37:50.518 --> 37:53.062
Well, you'd use a mallet.
You'd use a baseball bat.

37:53.104 --> 37:54.522
Maybe...

37:54.563 --> 37:56.357
A meat tenderizer. I don't know.

37:58.025 --> 38:00.236
A meat-- a meat tenderizer?

38:01.112 --> 38:05.491
Where am I going to get
a meat tenderizer, hm?

38:12.456 --> 38:13.749
Meat tenderizer.

38:16.002 --> 38:17.670
Right this way, Daniel.

38:34.979 --> 38:36.105
Okay.

38:37.148 --> 38:38.441
Oof.

38:39.775 --> 38:40.860
Oh.

38:42.611 --> 38:44.196
I thought these places
were, um...

38:44.238 --> 38:46.240
Oh.

38:46.282 --> 38:48.492
I thought these places
were supposed to be,
um...

38:49.076 --> 38:50.745
...sterile, like hospitals.

38:54.498 --> 38:56.000
If the place is too clean,

38:57.043 --> 38:58.961
the meat don't taste as good.

38:59.003 --> 39:00.421
Too clean?

39:01.213 --> 39:02.673
Fuck me.

39:02.715 --> 39:04.633
I feel like I need
a tetanus shot in my face.

39:06.344 --> 39:08.721
Mm.

40:05.903 --> 40:09.990
You want the blood
to bleed out real nice.

40:10.866 --> 40:14.078
The femoral artery
will bleed you dry in no time.

40:15.996 --> 40:17.790
You know, this might
take some time.

40:18.374 --> 40:19.458
If you want,

40:20.501 --> 40:22.753
I could brew us up
a pot of coffee

40:22.795 --> 40:26.132
and maybe fry us up
some sausage sandwiches.

40:28.426 --> 40:30.886
I'm good. I'm super good.

40:30.928 --> 40:32.221
Thank you. Uh...

40:33.389 --> 40:35.516
I'm gonna be outside. Alright?

40:38.519 --> 40:39.937
Suit yourself.

40:59.999 --> 41:02.334
Oh, shit. Um,
I'm gonna be on my way.

41:02.376 --> 41:03.836
Hey, Tammy,
I need to ask you
a few questions.

41:03.878 --> 41:05.296
I'm not working.
I was just cruising by,

41:05.337 --> 41:06.922
- saying hi to some friends.
- Come here.

41:08.716 --> 41:10.551
I'm not here
to give you a hard time.

41:10.593 --> 41:12.011
I just need to ask you
a few questions.

41:15.097 --> 41:16.390
Get over here.

41:28.903 --> 41:31.113
- What's up?
- Did you know that poor girl

41:31.155 --> 41:32.448
that got hit by the truck?

41:32.990 --> 41:34.116
Personally?

41:34.158 --> 41:36.285
No, I've seen her
around, though.

41:37.369 --> 41:39.371
Did you hear any stories
about anybody unusual

41:39.413 --> 41:41.415
coming around with her
or any other other girls?

41:42.458 --> 41:44.335
No one new.

41:45.127 --> 41:46.837
You didn't hear anything
from the other girls,

41:46.879 --> 41:49.173
some of the people
you work with, anything?

41:49.215 --> 41:51.550
No. Can I go home now?

41:52.384 --> 41:54.595
Okay. Alright, thank you.

42:07.107 --> 42:08.192
All done?

42:11.445 --> 42:12.530
We're good.

42:15.866 --> 42:16.951
You know...

42:17.910 --> 42:19.870
if you cleaned
yourself up, you know,

42:19.912 --> 42:22.498
you know, shaved your beard,
you know, put on some cologne,

42:22.540 --> 42:25.626
maybe got some new
threads, right?
A nice whip, nice ride.

42:25.668 --> 42:28.754
You can have some fine
classy ass coming in
and out of here all day, right?

42:28.796 --> 42:30.089
Fuck knows you can afford it.

42:30.130 --> 42:32.007
You got more money
than God, huh?

42:32.049 --> 42:33.342
This land alone's got
to be worth what?

42:33.384 --> 42:35.636
Millions. Millions.

42:37.137 --> 42:38.389
I don't work alone.

42:38.430 --> 42:40.683
Oh, yeah, I'm well aware.

42:40.724 --> 42:44.645
I heard you got,
uh, seven million
for your uncle's spot.

42:46.522 --> 42:48.774
- That's not true.
- Whatever.

42:48.816 --> 42:50.401
It's irrelevant, right?

42:50.442 --> 42:51.860
Whatever money you have,

42:51.902 --> 42:54.405
you can get a fucking tail train
coming through here.

42:55.197 --> 42:56.448
It was eight and a half million.

42:58.200 --> 42:59.618
Eight and a half
million dollars?

42:59.660 --> 43:01.829
- That's right.
- And you still live here?

43:02.371 --> 43:04.707
Well, this is my home.

43:13.799 --> 43:15.217
What the fuck was that?

43:16.885 --> 43:18.095
It's feeding time.

43:23.225 --> 43:24.310
Come see.

43:32.985 --> 43:35.529
- Come on.
- Oh, what the fuck is this?

43:36.905 --> 43:38.324
- Come on.
- It's wind.

43:39.617 --> 43:41.160
- I know what it is.
- Here you go.

43:42.745 --> 43:44.622
Come on.

43:47.166 --> 43:49.793
I know, I know, I know.
Here you go, here you go.

43:52.338 --> 43:53.922
Come on.

44:02.222 --> 44:05.142
- What are you
feeding them? Meat?
- Come here. Oh, no.

44:06.018 --> 44:07.561
These babies...

44:08.228 --> 44:09.688
...they'll eat anything.

44:11.899 --> 44:14.318
So don't ever stick
your hand or your foot...

44:16.153 --> 44:17.488
or that tiny dick of yours

44:17.529 --> 44:19.365
through that fence here,
'cause if you do...

44:24.703 --> 44:26.538
...guaranteed they're
gonna eat your ass.

44:26.580 --> 44:28.207
Maybe I should feed you to them.

44:28.248 --> 44:29.541
Oh, yeah, you promise?

44:35.422 --> 44:37.216
Is that a fucking hand?

44:38.092 --> 44:39.760
Hey, Squee, um...

44:40.302 --> 44:42.096
There was some
Lisa bitch at Star's

44:42.137 --> 44:44.723
and she's asking
just a lot of questions.

44:44.765 --> 44:46.100
Who the fuck is Lisa?

44:46.141 --> 44:47.267
I don't know
who the fuck Lisa is.

44:47.309 --> 44:48.602
You tell me who Lisa is.

44:49.812 --> 44:50.979
Did I miss something?

44:56.610 --> 44:58.696
Yeah, mind your fucking
business, eggplant.

45:00.114 --> 45:02.700
Did you bring that blow
you promised me last time?

45:02.741 --> 45:04.326
Do I look like
I'm running a charity?

45:04.368 --> 45:06.078
Well, you know
I'll work for it, right?

45:07.037 --> 45:08.330
In your dreams.

45:08.372 --> 45:10.874
Yeah? You wanna walk
into the sunset with me?

45:10.916 --> 45:12.793
My dreams are this way. Come on.

45:24.471 --> 45:25.806
- Get away from that. Get away.
- What?

45:25.848 --> 45:27.683
Don't touch that. Okay?

45:29.268 --> 45:32.020
- It's deadly.
- That thing will kill you?

45:33.605 --> 45:34.690
Just leave it alone.

45:35.774 --> 45:38.610
Huh. Do you have
a little Indian outfit

45:38.652 --> 45:40.696
you like to dress it up in
for Christmas?

45:42.656 --> 45:46.076
This is the highest-powered,
carbon-fiber

45:46.118 --> 45:48.954
compound bow
on the planet.

45:51.832 --> 45:54.251
I do like it
when you talk dirty to me.

45:54.293 --> 45:56.336
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

46:07.264 --> 46:08.640
Hey, Paul,
you got a sec?

46:09.725 --> 46:11.602
- What up?
- When you get a chance,

46:11.643 --> 46:13.061
I'd like to take a look
at that report

46:13.103 --> 46:14.605
you took from the couple
in the RV.

46:15.355 --> 46:17.065
- For what?
- I just wanna

46:17.107 --> 46:18.692
comb through and see
if we missed anything.

46:20.819 --> 46:22.154
I see what you're doing.

46:23.155 --> 46:25.240
You're trying to get back
with your ex, ain't you?

46:26.742 --> 46:30.746
I understand, man.
She got a nice,
tight little booty.

46:30.788 --> 46:31.872
What the fuck did you say to me?

46:33.123 --> 46:35.375
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
- What are you doing, Jack?

46:36.251 --> 46:37.753
You know he's not worth it.

46:48.096 --> 46:50.516
She's married to a cop
so don't go fucking with her.

46:51.183 --> 46:53.101
Oh, come on, Star.

46:53.143 --> 46:56.897
Why you gotta act
like I'm aggressive
or something? I'm just...

46:58.273 --> 47:00.984
I'm making small talk
'cause I've never
seen her before.

47:01.026 --> 47:03.320
Well, that's all I got,
and I gotta work.

47:05.072 --> 47:06.490
I know something about it.

47:07.491 --> 47:08.992
Oh, yeah, what do you know?

47:11.245 --> 47:12.246
Huh?

47:16.083 --> 47:17.167
Hey.

47:19.044 --> 47:20.128
Yeah, you.

47:21.672 --> 47:24.007
Spare a couple of smokes
for a couple of pretty girls?

47:27.928 --> 47:29.346
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yeah?

47:29.388 --> 47:30.389
Yeah.

47:30.973 --> 47:32.057
Come and get them.

47:33.183 --> 47:34.601
- Alright. Come on.
- Uh-huh.

47:35.519 --> 47:36.603
Thanks a lot.

47:41.733 --> 47:43.360
Yeah? What?

47:54.872 --> 47:56.123
Oh, well, well,
well, well, well,

47:56.164 --> 47:58.250
now that looks like
a whole lot of fun.

48:00.419 --> 48:01.503
You got a light?

48:06.216 --> 48:08.051
Hey!

48:08.552 --> 48:10.178
- What?
- Not in here.

48:10.220 --> 48:12.180
- You know that!
- Oh, come on, Star.

48:12.222 --> 48:14.433
- Really?
- Out back.

48:15.225 --> 48:16.226
Fuck.

48:16.810 --> 48:18.812
I'm taking these.
You wanna come outside?

48:18.854 --> 48:20.814
Come on, Mister.
Come on, girl.

48:20.856 --> 48:22.441
Are you sure it's unlocked?

48:22.482 --> 48:23.901
- Go. Yes.
- Thank you.

48:34.161 --> 48:35.162
Well...

48:46.214 --> 48:49.134
You ladies have a good evening.

48:49.176 --> 48:51.053
I got something better
waiting for me at home.

48:51.094 --> 48:52.179
What's that?

48:56.433 --> 48:59.019
Oh. What's your pleasure?

49:00.395 --> 49:01.480
Mm.

49:02.564 --> 49:05.943
I do like me some
Scooby snacks. Right?

49:09.613 --> 49:10.822
What about you, Miss?

49:11.949 --> 49:13.450
Well,
that's the best way

49:13.492 --> 49:15.577
to spend a Saturday morning.

49:15.619 --> 49:17.245
- Hey.
- Hey.

49:17.329 --> 49:19.498
I'm looking
for that crazy girl
with the red hair.

49:19.539 --> 49:21.291
Not you, obviously.

49:21.333 --> 49:22.793
Earline, yeah, why?

49:22.834 --> 49:24.711
'Cause she's just been in here
asking about you.

49:24.753 --> 49:27.381
Really? Is she here now?

49:27.422 --> 49:30.342
- Might as well start now.
- Girl, Scooby-Dooby-Doo,
you know it.

49:39.017 --> 49:41.269
That meth head better not be
bringing trouble to my bar.

49:41.311 --> 49:42.604
No, no, no trouble, Star.

49:42.646 --> 49:44.314
I just wanna ask her
a couple questions.

49:49.069 --> 49:50.654
You got a ride or what?

49:51.947 --> 49:53.240
I got a ride.

49:53.281 --> 49:55.117
Well, you're in luck.
She just went out back.

49:55.158 --> 49:56.451
Ah. Thanks.

50:04.876 --> 50:07.754
Hey, Star, she's not out there.
Did she come back through here?

50:07.796 --> 50:09.631
- No, love, sorry.
- Any idea where
she might've gone?

50:09.673 --> 50:11.967
Yo, Star, this drink
ain't gonna refill itself, hon.

50:12.009 --> 50:14.594
Hold your ass, Mickey.
It's coming.

50:14.636 --> 50:16.596
I'm sorry, Lisa.
I got no idea.

50:25.647 --> 50:28.692
Would you do me a favor
and take off your shoes, please?

50:29.317 --> 50:30.360
Seriously?

50:30.944 --> 50:32.029
Thank you.

50:32.612 --> 50:35.532
- This place is a--
- We are a guest
in this man's house.

50:36.241 --> 50:37.492
Take off your shoes.

50:49.296 --> 50:51.548
Yeah, girl, get it. Get it.

50:57.179 --> 50:58.680
Get it.

51:19.993 --> 51:21.745
Mm.

51:26.833 --> 51:29.127
Alright. Mm.

51:44.559 --> 51:46.978
Alright, that's my cue
to leave.

51:47.020 --> 51:49.231
What do you mean?
The party's just getting started.

51:49.272 --> 51:52.484
- I don't wanna leave yet.
- Oh, I know, doll. Trust me.

51:55.904 --> 51:57.197
You're not leaving.

52:04.246 --> 52:06.706
Hey, Squee, can I have
the keys to the truck?

52:09.126 --> 52:10.127
Sure.

52:14.214 --> 52:15.715
Oh, you know,
if you pick up
some eggs,

52:15.757 --> 52:17.843
I can make our favorite
sausage sandwiches.

52:19.845 --> 52:22.556
- Yeah.
- Go easy tonight, okay?

52:23.140 --> 52:25.559
If you puke in the truck,
you're cleaning it up.

52:25.600 --> 52:27.227
Right, yeah. Uh...

52:27.269 --> 52:29.312
You guys married or something?

52:30.105 --> 52:32.607
Oh, well, yeah.

52:34.776 --> 52:38.655
Oh, well, there's that.
But look, don't you
worry, honey.

52:38.697 --> 52:40.657
You just enjoy
your chicken flippin', alright?

52:40.699 --> 52:42.159
- Okay.
- Mm.

52:42.200 --> 52:44.202
Yeah.

52:44.244 --> 52:46.580
Are you ready?

52:58.300 --> 52:59.759
What's all this?

53:00.260 --> 53:01.928
Oh, you know, I just got a...

53:02.721 --> 53:05.390
little bit of a thing
for clear plastic.

53:05.432 --> 53:07.642
You're fuckin' weird.

53:08.143 --> 53:10.187
Hmm. "Weird"?

53:11.271 --> 53:12.397
Weird how?

53:12.439 --> 53:15.108
Just in every way.

53:15.150 --> 53:17.569
Well, that's a little vague.
Where are you going?

53:18.862 --> 53:20.488
I'm thirsty.
I'm gonna get a beer

53:20.530 --> 53:22.032
before we consummate
the evening.

53:22.073 --> 53:23.825
Oh, no, no, please.

53:23.867 --> 53:25.785
You're my guest.
Sit down. I can get it.

53:26.578 --> 53:28.705
Well, aren't you a gentleman?

53:28.747 --> 53:31.583
Here, I can go grab you one,
and you can open it for me.

53:46.723 --> 53:47.807
I can explain.

53:53.772 --> 53:55.774
Oh, you looking
for Officer Jack?

53:55.815 --> 53:57.734
He's in an investigation
right now

53:57.776 --> 53:59.027
with one of your sisters.

54:00.362 --> 54:01.947
- You'd do the work for me?
-  - Yeah.

54:02.197 --> 54:04.449
- Is that what we're doing?
- Only if I can sit
in this chair.

54:04.491 --> 54:06.993
You can sit in that chair.
That's the captain's chair.

54:07.035 --> 54:08.912
Oh, hey.

54:09.579 --> 54:11.623
I didn't-- I didn't know
you were coming by.

54:12.374 --> 54:14.542
- Clearly.
- Normally, you text first.

54:14.584 --> 54:17.796
I did text.
I guess you were busy

54:17.837 --> 54:19.673
looking down
your partner's shirt.

54:19.714 --> 54:21.633
Lisa, don't.

54:22.259 --> 54:24.219
- Oh, it's okay.
- I wasn't looking down
anybody's shirt.

54:24.261 --> 54:25.887
I'll see myself out.

54:25.929 --> 54:27.013
Have fun.

54:30.517 --> 54:32.519
Um...

54:32.560 --> 54:36.314
So I... I came because
I heard you were talking
to some of the girls,

54:36.356 --> 54:39.109
so I wanted to see
if you heard anything,
but I've...

54:39.150 --> 54:41.069
You've clearly moved on
to another investigation...

54:41.111 --> 54:42.779
- No.
- ...so I'm gonna...

54:42.821 --> 54:44.447
- I'm gonna just go.
- No, Lisa, I have
been following up.

54:44.489 --> 54:46.700
I-- Lisa.

54:46.741 --> 54:49.077
Lisa, you shouldn't
walk out like this.

54:49.119 --> 54:51.788
We at least need to have
a conversation about this.

54:55.709 --> 54:57.210
- Ugh.
- Hey!

55:01.381 --> 55:03.508
You were acting
like a crazy person.

55:03.550 --> 55:06.136
- What the hell
is wrong with you?
- What is wrong with me?

55:06.177 --> 55:07.762
Every time I walk
into your office,

55:07.804 --> 55:10.724
that strippergram
is all over you.

55:10.765 --> 55:12.767
You walked out on me.
You don't get to say

55:12.809 --> 55:14.519
who I talk to or what I do.

55:15.145 --> 55:17.397
I guess it's true that a tiger
doesn't change his stripes.

55:20.233 --> 55:23.028
You promised me
to never bring that up again.

55:23.069 --> 55:24.404
We are past that.

55:24.446 --> 55:26.531
You were so caught up
in your own bullshit,

55:26.573 --> 55:28.325
you haven't given any thought
to think about

55:28.366 --> 55:30.368
how hard these past two months
have been for me.

55:30.869 --> 55:33.121
You're falling apart,
and you're taking us with you.

55:33.163 --> 55:35.790
- You still haven't
fixed this roof.
- Fuck.

55:35.832 --> 55:37.500
Your whole life
is falling apart,

55:37.542 --> 55:39.294
and you'd rather freeze
to death than fix it.

55:41.504 --> 55:42.589
Whoa.

55:43.298 --> 55:45.008
What is it that you
wanna say, Jack?

55:45.050 --> 55:46.384
- I didn't mean to say that.
- Just say it. You've been dying

55:46.426 --> 55:48.053
to say it this whole time,
so just say it.

55:48.094 --> 55:50.221
- You wanna say
that I'm selfish?
- All I'm trying to do

55:50.263 --> 55:51.431
is win you back.

55:55.226 --> 55:56.227
Hey.

56:01.483 --> 56:02.734
I'm sorry, okay?

56:04.110 --> 56:05.195
Me too.

56:06.154 --> 56:09.366
- Not about the tart, though.
-  I'm not sorry about that.

56:15.497 --> 56:16.956
Okay, you're not gonna
like this, but...

56:18.083 --> 56:19.667
Joe was saying that the woman
at the hospital

56:19.709 --> 56:21.252
had manure all over her,

56:21.294 --> 56:23.296
and an old couple is saying
that they were on the side

56:23.338 --> 56:25.090
- of the farms by the track.
- Are you--

56:25.131 --> 56:26.424
- Fucking right now?
- There's only three farms
with livestock.

56:26.466 --> 56:28.676
You're talking about
this shit right now?

56:29.177 --> 56:31.054
Stay the fuck out of my job.

56:31.096 --> 56:33.473
This is becoming
your new addiction

56:33.515 --> 56:35.767
and I don't wanna be
around you when you slide.

56:39.062 --> 56:40.146
Fuck.

57:06.047 --> 57:07.132
You know...

57:10.009 --> 57:12.137
I'm always up
for the hunt, but...

57:13.138 --> 57:14.431
I'm thinking...

57:17.100 --> 57:18.977
maybe it's time
you take a break.

57:23.356 --> 57:24.774
For fuck's sake, Earline.

57:25.525 --> 57:29.070
You're the last person
I ever expected to be
talking me down off of crazy.

57:30.321 --> 57:32.157
Well, what are you trying
to say, Squee?

57:32.782 --> 57:35.201
I'm saying you're nuttier
than squirrel shit.

57:40.165 --> 57:42.667
I think that's actually
the nicest thing
you ever said to me.

57:46.463 --> 57:47.547
It's just...

57:49.591 --> 57:51.885
It's just that I care, and...

57:55.722 --> 57:56.806
I just...

57:57.932 --> 58:00.185
Even sounds kind of weird
to say out loud.

58:02.979 --> 58:04.063
Yeah, me too.

58:07.442 --> 58:08.818
And you always said,

58:09.986 --> 58:11.321
"never too close together."

58:11.362 --> 58:13.448
Ain't never done 'em
too close together.

58:15.950 --> 58:17.660
Yeah, well, things change.

58:20.955 --> 58:22.499
Know what I think?

58:23.500 --> 58:24.834
No.

58:26.002 --> 58:27.086
I think...

58:28.171 --> 58:30.256
that Lisa bitch
is making you hard.

58:30.757 --> 58:32.634
- Oh, come on, Earline.
- Mm-hmm.

58:32.675 --> 58:35.053
- You know that ain't it.
- Mm-hmm.

58:35.887 --> 58:37.472
But she is out there still,

58:38.264 --> 58:40.058
and I am keen on finding her.

58:41.643 --> 58:44.646
All I'm saying is,
if you get caught,

58:46.147 --> 58:48.066
don't you get me fucked
in the process.

58:56.366 --> 58:57.492
Speaking of...

58:59.160 --> 59:01.371
Look at this pretty
little piggy right here.

59:01.871 --> 59:02.872
Now?

59:04.415 --> 59:05.708
It ain't dark yet.

59:06.251 --> 59:09.420
- Oh, I don't see
the difference.

59:10.380 --> 59:11.923
Come on, Squee.

59:13.216 --> 59:14.217
Go.

59:17.262 --> 59:18.263
Please?

59:19.722 --> 59:22.267
- Hi.
- What do you guys want?

59:22.308 --> 59:25.103
Ah, hold on, hold on.
No, no, no.
Don't get...

59:25.144 --> 59:26.896
Don't get hostile.
I'm just being friendly.

59:26.938 --> 59:28.356
Actually, we're, uh...

59:28.398 --> 59:30.984
We're going to a party,
and my friend here thought

59:31.025 --> 59:33.903
it might be fun
to invite you along.

59:33.945 --> 59:35.154
I ain't a hooker.

59:36.406 --> 59:37.949
I-I know that.

59:38.741 --> 59:41.035
And, look, he's not...
he's not looking to bone.

59:42.412 --> 59:43.830
Now, listen,
I know these...

59:43.871 --> 59:45.248
I know these looks
are deceiving,

59:45.290 --> 59:47.125
but I'm telling you,
this guy is rich.

59:48.126 --> 59:49.794
So if he wanted to get laid,

59:49.836 --> 59:51.754
- he can just get
a top-shelf girl.

59:52.380 --> 59:53.673
He don't look rich.

59:55.675 --> 59:56.759
Okay, look.

59:57.635 --> 59:59.345
Do you wanna go
to a party or not?

01:00:00.013 --> 01:00:02.140
This guy is my friend.

01:00:03.057 --> 01:00:04.976
He has the best party favors,
and he likes to share them

01:00:05.018 --> 01:00:06.477
with pretty girls, and...

01:00:07.937 --> 01:00:10.565
he thinks you're pretty,
but he's shy,

01:00:11.149 --> 01:00:13.276
which is why I'm here
talking to you, so...

01:00:13.860 --> 01:00:15.403
- Will you say something?
- Excuse me, ma'am.

01:00:18.698 --> 01:00:21.284
You know you have
real kind eyes.

01:00:23.661 --> 01:00:24.787
Are they green?

01:00:25.997 --> 01:00:27.332
Yeah.

01:00:28.374 --> 01:00:29.876
I've always wanted green eyes.

01:00:33.338 --> 01:00:34.547
What's your name?

01:00:35.632 --> 01:00:37.216
Lulu. And yours?

01:00:40.303 --> 01:00:41.638
Molly Ringwald?

01:00:43.598 --> 01:00:44.891
You're funny.

01:00:47.101 --> 01:00:48.269
But are you rich?

01:00:52.106 --> 01:00:53.191
Come join us.

01:00:54.150 --> 01:00:56.069
What's the worst
that could happen?

01:01:02.283 --> 01:01:03.576
What's the worst
that could happen?

01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:06.746
Okey-dokey.

01:01:18.508 --> 01:01:19.884
Peace offering.

01:01:23.054 --> 01:01:24.138
Come in.

01:01:53.084 --> 01:01:54.502
I just need
a little more time.

01:01:57.213 --> 01:01:58.381
A little more time.

01:02:09.684 --> 01:02:11.310
Oh...

01:02:13.896 --> 01:02:15.565
Oh. Mm.

01:02:27.410 --> 01:02:29.328
- Oh...
- What's so funny?

01:02:30.913 --> 01:02:35.126
That's it. I have
no fucking idea
what's so funny. It just is.

01:02:39.213 --> 01:02:41.591
Mm.

01:02:41.632 --> 01:02:42.717
I get it.

01:02:44.594 --> 01:02:46.179
I like to laugh too.

01:02:49.766 --> 01:02:52.435
I think I'm gonna need you
to take your clothes off.

01:02:53.686 --> 01:02:56.105
What the fuck, dude?
I thought you said no sex.

01:03:06.699 --> 01:03:08.701
What the fuck is it with you
letting these bitches get away?

01:03:08.743 --> 01:03:11.329
Hey! If she gets away,
it's your ass too!

01:03:11.370 --> 01:03:12.914
Get off your ass and help!

01:03:13.873 --> 01:03:15.458
Well, you better go
find her, then.

01:03:46.405 --> 01:03:49.283
Here you are! Fuck you, pussy!

01:03:50.952 --> 01:03:52.203
I told you,

01:03:52.245 --> 01:03:55.122
they are not little pets,
you pussy!

01:03:55.164 --> 01:03:57.166
Oh, no, no. Please.

01:03:57.208 --> 01:03:59.877
I should have slit
your throat at birth!

01:03:59.919 --> 01:04:02.421
He'll make good eats.

01:04:02.463 --> 01:04:04.757
So tender when they're little.

01:04:08.427 --> 01:04:10.012
Please...

01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:24.360
Out comes the baby.

01:05:38.225 --> 01:05:40.144
I promise it'll only be
for a couple of weeks.

01:05:40.186 --> 01:05:42.521
No, I told you,
you're welcome to stay
until the end of the month

01:05:42.563 --> 01:05:45.316
and then, you know,
you'll get settled
in your new job,

01:05:45.358 --> 01:05:47.109
and I'll help you find
a place of your own.

01:05:57.244 --> 01:05:59.664
Um, I, uh...

01:06:00.873 --> 01:06:02.959
I wanna start clean with you.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:04.460
Please don't be mad.

01:06:05.670 --> 01:06:09.090
I haven't done any in two weeks.
I was keeping this...

01:06:10.257 --> 01:06:11.550
...just in case.

01:06:19.266 --> 01:06:20.685
But I-I, I don't wanna hide

01:06:20.726 --> 01:06:22.186
anything from you, and I...

01:06:23.479 --> 01:06:25.106
I don't want that anymore.

01:06:31.195 --> 01:06:32.363
Are you mad?

01:06:33.906 --> 01:06:35.241
I'm not mad.

01:06:35.783 --> 01:06:38.619
Okay, because
this might sound silly, but...

01:06:39.912 --> 01:06:41.622
no one's ever been
this nice to me.

01:06:42.373 --> 01:06:45.459
I mean, no one even really knew
I existed, but...

01:06:46.919 --> 01:06:48.713
for some reason,
you believe in me.

01:06:50.297 --> 01:06:51.382
And I...

01:06:52.049 --> 01:06:54.093
wanna make you proud,
or whatever.

01:06:56.387 --> 01:06:58.764
I am-- I am proud
of you, Sadie.

01:06:59.390 --> 01:07:01.642
It doesn't sound silly.
This is...

01:07:01.684 --> 01:07:04.854
This took a lot of courage.
Thank you for trusting me.

01:07:11.277 --> 01:07:12.486
Where'd you get it?

01:07:14.321 --> 01:07:16.615
- Please, Lisa.
- No, come on, seriously.

01:07:16.657 --> 01:07:18.492
It's really important, Sadie.

01:07:18.534 --> 01:07:21.620
N-no, no, no, no.
I-it was just
from some random kid

01:07:21.662 --> 01:07:23.956
- on the other side of town.
- What did he look like?

01:07:24.915 --> 01:07:27.168
I don't know.
A kid with a hoodie?

01:07:27.209 --> 01:07:29.336
- I mean, it could
have been anybody.

01:07:29.378 --> 01:07:31.047
- Lisa, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- No, it's--

01:07:31.088 --> 01:07:32.465
No, no, no,
don't be sorry. It's okay.

01:07:32.506 --> 01:07:33.924
But I-I gotta take this
to the station.

01:07:33.966 --> 01:07:35.718
- What? No. No.
- No, seriously, you're--

01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:37.261
I promise you,
you're not in any trouble.

01:07:37.303 --> 01:07:39.638
I don't want you
to worry, okay?
I got you, girl.

01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:41.015
- Lisa.
- This is our secret,

01:07:41.057 --> 01:07:43.309
but this might be
a good lead on the case.

01:07:43.350 --> 01:07:44.769
- "Secret"? But you're...
- They may be able to find out

01:07:44.810 --> 01:07:46.103
where it came from.

01:07:47.188 --> 01:07:49.315
Don't worry.
I'll be back in a flash.

01:07:49.356 --> 01:07:50.649
Please don't.

01:07:50.691 --> 01:07:51.942
Lisa, please.

01:07:51.984 --> 01:07:53.819
Fuck me, huh?

01:08:01.118 --> 01:08:02.328
- Hello?
- Hey.

01:08:02.369 --> 01:08:03.954
You at the station?

01:08:04.580 --> 01:08:06.832
No, I'm just finishing up
with some asshole.

01:08:06.874 --> 01:08:09.335
- What's up?
- You were right, Jack.

01:08:09.376 --> 01:08:11.295
Oh, good. I love it
when I'm right.

01:08:11.337 --> 01:08:12.588
What was I right about?

01:08:12.630 --> 01:08:14.090
I think it's time I let you in.

01:08:15.466 --> 01:08:17.968
I was hoping you'd come
to that conclusion.

01:08:18.010 --> 01:08:19.303
Can you come over later?

01:08:19.345 --> 01:08:20.846
Sadie's going to work soon.

01:08:20.888 --> 01:08:22.556
I thought we can talk some more

01:08:22.598 --> 01:08:25.309
and make up for lost time.
What do you think?

01:08:25.351 --> 01:08:27.186
I think I'll be
hightailing it over there

01:08:27.228 --> 01:08:28.979
just as soon
as I'm finished up here.

01:08:29.021 --> 01:08:30.272
I'll see you soon.

01:08:34.110 --> 01:08:37.029
Hey, hey. Good timing.

01:08:37.071 --> 01:08:39.073
- You wanna take
the collar on this one?
- Okay.

01:08:39.115 --> 01:08:40.658
Okay, good. The perp's
in the back.

01:08:40.699 --> 01:08:42.409
My cruise is a little
worse for the wear.

01:08:42.451 --> 01:08:44.286
Do you mind if I take yours?
Ah, that's...

01:08:44.328 --> 01:08:45.996
You'll get a promotion for this.

01:09:26.537 --> 01:09:27.746
Thank you.

01:09:28.873 --> 01:09:30.040
No worries.

01:09:47.224 --> 01:09:48.309
Do you live here?

01:09:49.143 --> 01:09:52.521
No, ma'am, just, uh, here
to see a business colleague.

01:09:54.398 --> 01:09:55.482
After you.

01:10:02.489 --> 01:10:04.200
I don't live here either.

01:10:04.241 --> 01:10:05.826
Just staying with a friend.

01:10:05.868 --> 01:10:06.869
Oh.

01:10:13.751 --> 01:10:16.003
So, what kind of business
are you in?

01:10:16.045 --> 01:10:18.631
Meat. Fresh meat.

01:10:18.672 --> 01:10:19.924
Like a butcher?

01:10:19.965 --> 01:10:23.093
Yeah. Just slicing
and dicing meat.

01:10:23.969 --> 01:10:25.554
Isn't that kind of weird?

01:10:25.596 --> 01:10:27.681
Killing? Chopping up animals?

01:10:28.557 --> 01:10:30.059
You know, you get used to it.

01:10:30.684 --> 01:10:32.478
Creatures don't even
see it coming.

01:10:33.938 --> 01:10:35.731
Killing part's over in seconds.

01:10:37.233 --> 01:10:39.860
Well, that's good, I guess,
that they don't see it coming.

01:10:46.283 --> 01:10:47.409
What about you?

01:10:48.911 --> 01:10:52.122
Um, actually, I just
started a new job.

01:10:52.164 --> 01:10:54.959
I'm officially the receptionist
at the Lincoln Hotel.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:56.001
Really?

01:10:56.877 --> 01:11:00.965
Wow. You know, I think
that you'll make
a fantastic receptionist.

01:11:01.757 --> 01:11:02.967
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:11:04.802 --> 01:11:07.554
You know, you look
so familiar to me.
Have we met?

01:11:08.472 --> 01:11:09.598
I don't think so.

01:11:10.266 --> 01:11:12.184
I mean,
it's a small town, but...

01:11:13.978 --> 01:11:15.813
I'd never forget
eyes like yours.

01:11:17.398 --> 01:11:20.109
Okay, well,
this is my stop.

01:11:21.652 --> 01:11:23.570
You're staying with Lisa?

01:11:25.030 --> 01:11:26.365
Yes.

01:11:26.407 --> 01:11:28.117
That's who I'm here to see.

01:11:28.158 --> 01:11:29.660
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:11:29.702 --> 01:11:31.578
That must be
why I recognize you.

01:11:31.620 --> 01:11:33.163
What did you say
your name was?

01:11:34.540 --> 01:11:35.916
Theodore.

01:11:35.958 --> 01:11:37.751
Most people call me Squealer.

01:11:38.335 --> 01:11:39.670
Okay.

01:11:39.712 --> 01:11:41.422
Um, Lisa just ran out
for a minute,

01:11:41.463 --> 01:11:44.550
but you are welcome to wait
with me if you'd like.

01:11:49.555 --> 01:11:52.182
No. You know, I...
I don't wanna be an imposition.

01:11:52.224 --> 01:11:54.643
I could just wait out here.

01:11:54.685 --> 01:11:55.978
It's no imposition at all.

01:11:56.020 --> 01:11:57.730
Please, come in.

01:11:59.273 --> 01:12:01.775
- Okay, then.
- Do you mind
if I call you Theo?

01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:06.697
My mama used to call me Theo.

01:13:22.481 --> 01:13:25.025
Come on, pick up
for Christ's sakes.

01:13:28.404 --> 01:13:29.947
Hey, Joe.

01:13:32.491 --> 01:13:34.618
Well, what the fuck
does he want?

01:13:34.660 --> 01:13:38.414
Listen, I think I found
your, uh, mysterious
red-haired girl.

01:13:38.455 --> 01:13:41.792
They pulled into this pig farm
out here on the county road

01:13:41.834 --> 01:13:43.710
called, uh, Squealer's.

01:13:43.752 --> 01:13:45.671
Oh, my God, that's got
to be the farm.

01:13:45.712 --> 01:13:48.674
Focus. You're gonna take
my truck, okay?

01:13:48.715 --> 01:13:50.551
- Okay.
- Okay. No, wait.

01:13:50.592 --> 01:13:51.844
We're gonna see
if he follows you.

01:13:51.885 --> 01:13:53.262
- Okay.
- If it's the farm he wants,

01:13:53.303 --> 01:13:54.388
- I'll deal with it.
- Okay.

01:13:55.597 --> 01:13:57.474
Hang tight and don't do
anything stupid.

01:13:57.516 --> 01:13:59.643
Me don't do anything stupid.
You don't do anything stupid,

01:13:59.685 --> 01:14:01.228
- for Christ's sake.
- No, no, no.

01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:03.063
I'm-I'm gonna call Jack
right now, okay?

01:14:03.105 --> 01:14:04.481
I'll let him handle it.

01:14:04.523 --> 01:14:06.859
Put it down. Put it down.

01:14:08.110 --> 01:14:10.863
Okay, look, just don't touch
anything, okay?

01:14:10.904 --> 01:14:13.031
Just don't--
You do know
how to drive, right?

01:14:13.907 --> 01:14:16.743
I have stolen nicer cars
like this since I was 12.

01:14:16.785 --> 01:14:19.121
- Do not insult me.
- And don't mess with my seat.

01:14:19.163 --> 01:14:20.581
Oh, come on.

01:14:20.622 --> 01:14:22.332
- Hello, this is
Detective Jackson.
- No...

01:14:22.374 --> 01:14:23.542
Leave a message,
and I'll get back to you

01:14:23.584 --> 01:14:24.668
- as soon as I can.
- Ugh.

01:14:25.836 --> 01:14:28.255
Don't touch the temperature.
Don't touch the rearview mirror.

01:14:28.297 --> 01:14:29.715
And don't touch the radio.

01:14:29.756 --> 01:14:31.633
- Leave it on the opera.
- Uh-huh.

01:14:32.676 --> 01:14:34.011
Don't touch it!

01:14:36.054 --> 01:14:37.514
Hey, um, Jack.

01:14:37.556 --> 01:14:40.267
Okay, um, you're not
gonna like this, but...

01:14:40.309 --> 01:14:43.270
Joe just found that crazy girl
that I've been
telling you about,

01:14:43.312 --> 01:14:45.522
and guess where she is?

01:14:45.564 --> 01:14:49.276
There is a pig farm
and it's called Squealer's,
okay?

01:14:49.318 --> 01:14:51.361
I'm gonna head
in that direction right now.

01:14:51.403 --> 01:14:53.071
But don't worry.
I'll wait for you.

01:14:53.655 --> 01:14:55.115
That fucking bitch.

01:15:12.883 --> 01:15:14.843
Uh, yeah, he's gone.

01:15:14.885 --> 01:15:17.346
Okay, get your ass
back here. Now.

01:15:17.387 --> 01:15:20.474
- And go gentle on my truck.
- Mm-hmm.

01:15:29.816 --> 01:15:30.817
Lisa?

01:15:39.910 --> 01:15:41.995
Please leave a message
after the tone.

01:15:43.330 --> 01:15:45.582
Hey, Joe,
can you call me back?

01:15:45.624 --> 01:15:48.335
I tried to take a shortcut,
but I think I got
turned around,

01:15:48.377 --> 01:15:50.504
even my GPS doesn't know
where I am.

01:16:04.393 --> 01:16:05.686
Oh...

01:16:07.479 --> 01:16:09.606
I missed you so much.

01:16:12.359 --> 01:16:13.735
You're so cold.

01:16:18.156 --> 01:16:20.242
Jesus Christ!

01:16:34.339 --> 01:16:36.383
Thanks. I'm alright.

01:16:36.425 --> 01:16:38.176
Just get here
as soon as you can.

01:16:40.846 --> 01:16:42.472
Hey, um, Jack.

01:16:42.514 --> 01:16:44.516
Okay, um,
you're not gonna like this,

01:16:44.558 --> 01:16:46.184
but Joe just found

01:16:46.226 --> 01:16:48.228
that crazy girl that
I've been telling you about,

01:16:48.270 --> 01:16:49.938
and guess where she is?

01:16:53.525 --> 01:16:55.861
No, no, no!

01:16:55.902 --> 01:16:57.321
No!

01:17:02.701 --> 01:17:03.869
Nothing. Oh, my God.

01:17:08.582 --> 01:17:10.208
- Hello, this is
Detective Jackson.
- Ugh!

01:17:10.334 --> 01:17:11.918
- Jack, come on.
- Leave a message,
and I'll get back to you

01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:13.253
as soon as I can.

01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:23.430
Ah, there you are.

01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:31.021
Joe, where are you?

01:17:31.063 --> 01:17:33.023
I'm only a few miles
away from the farm,

01:17:33.065 --> 01:17:35.067
but I really need someone
to come get me.

01:17:35.108 --> 01:17:36.526
Call me, please.

01:17:43.825 --> 01:17:46.745
But I know what it is.
You're pretty, right?
So you want somebody

01:17:46.787 --> 01:17:48.330
to cut you in line...

01:17:48.372 --> 01:17:51.083
...to make your stolen car
a priority over theirs.

01:17:51.124 --> 01:17:52.501
Their car matters.

01:17:52.542 --> 01:17:54.544
We even got--

01:17:54.586 --> 01:17:57.130
We take every call.
You know what I mean?

01:17:59.049 --> 01:18:00.884
Our clients
are a priority. We--

01:18:00.926 --> 01:18:03.053
- That's how
we've been in business.

01:18:03.095 --> 01:18:05.013
That's how we've been
in business this long.
You know what I mean?

01:18:05.055 --> 01:18:06.348
Oh, God.

01:18:34.710 --> 01:18:35.919
What the fuck are you doing?

01:18:36.503 --> 01:18:39.673
You should probably check
on your friend, Danny. He's a...

01:18:39.715 --> 01:18:41.550
He's a real mental case.

01:18:42.592 --> 01:18:43.677
Well, yeah.

01:18:44.636 --> 01:18:46.430
- Something happened?
- Probably.

01:18:49.558 --> 01:18:51.059
Earline, I don't know
what that means.

01:18:51.101 --> 01:18:53.478
It means that things
are getting too hot around here.

01:18:56.773 --> 01:18:57.858
You're leaving?

01:19:01.319 --> 01:19:02.529
You know me, man.

01:19:03.321 --> 01:19:04.740
I'm like the wind.

01:19:05.282 --> 01:19:06.783
I'll either see you around...

01:19:08.785 --> 01:19:09.953
or I won't.

01:19:15.876 --> 01:19:17.085
Okay.

01:19:48.867 --> 01:19:50.577
Did you see that bitch
who took my car?

01:19:51.787 --> 01:19:53.330
Why'd you give her your car?

01:19:53.830 --> 01:19:55.457
I didn't give her my car.

01:19:57.375 --> 01:19:58.502
She's gone.

01:20:00.003 --> 01:20:02.506
You better call your fucking
psycho sidekick cunt bitch

01:20:02.547 --> 01:20:04.049
and get her back here right now.

01:20:05.342 --> 01:20:07.135
Now!

01:20:07.511 --> 01:20:09.638
Whoo-hoo-hoo! Easy now!

01:20:09.679 --> 01:20:11.681
Put that fucking bow down.

01:20:11.723 --> 01:20:14.017
- Put my bow down!
- You motherfucker.

01:20:14.601 --> 01:20:16.978
Don't fuck with me.

01:20:22.275 --> 01:20:23.276
Fuck!

01:20:36.081 --> 01:20:38.375
You want a shoot-out
with me? Huh, pig boy?

01:20:38.416 --> 01:20:40.794
Is that what you want?

01:20:40.836 --> 01:20:43.630
- Let's go!
- Who the fuck
are you shooting at?

01:20:47.342 --> 01:20:50.971
Drop your weapon,
or the next shot
will not be a warning.

01:20:52.764 --> 01:20:55.350
Fuck, yeah. Let's go.

01:20:55.392 --> 01:20:57.811
Drop your fucking weapon.

01:20:58.353 --> 01:21:00.647
Who the fuck are you?

01:21:00.689 --> 01:21:02.440
Why would I drop my weapon?

01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:05.277
You need to drop
your fucking weapon.

01:21:06.361 --> 01:21:09.072
Ow, fuck!

01:21:11.616 --> 01:21:13.243
Ow!

01:21:16.997 --> 01:21:18.832
Drop your fucking weapon!

01:21:18.874 --> 01:21:21.668
I do not wanna kill you.
I don't even know
who the fuck you are.

01:21:21.710 --> 01:21:25.005
I'm fucking Danny Diamond,
you fucking cunt.

01:21:25.630 --> 01:21:27.757
It's your call,
but I got the drop on you.

01:21:27.799 --> 01:21:29.426
If you don't tie that leg off,

01:21:29.467 --> 01:21:31.052
you're gonna bleed out
pretty goddamn soon.

01:21:31.094 --> 01:21:32.596
Ha-ha-ha!

01:21:32.637 --> 01:21:33.847
Fuck you.

01:21:33.889 --> 01:21:35.932
Are you fucking
Nurse Ratched now?

01:21:35.974 --> 01:21:37.893
You can't fucking beat me.

01:21:38.643 --> 01:21:40.645
Ow!

01:22:01.958 --> 01:22:03.335
Oh, shit.

01:22:12.052 --> 01:22:13.803
You dirty little piggy.

01:22:21.186 --> 01:22:22.354
Okay...

01:22:23.021 --> 01:22:25.106
Ooh, Officer Jack,

01:22:25.774 --> 01:22:29.653
do you know what I do
to trespassing little pigs?

01:22:39.496 --> 01:22:40.580
Like a zipper.

01:22:48.505 --> 01:22:50.840
Oh.

01:22:54.970 --> 01:22:57.639
Oh. Oh, shh...

01:22:57.681 --> 01:23:00.266
Look at that.
It's your darlin', Lisa.

01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:03.645
You know what...

01:23:04.938 --> 01:23:07.732
Know what I think we'll do?
Maybe call her later

01:23:07.774 --> 01:23:10.610
and give her
a heartfelt goodbye. Huh?

01:23:12.112 --> 01:23:13.113
Yeah.

01:23:26.334 --> 01:23:27.335
Oh.

01:23:28.044 --> 01:23:29.504
Thank God.

01:23:37.762 --> 01:23:39.472
Oh, my God.

01:24:22.223 --> 01:24:23.308
What's wrong?

01:24:24.642 --> 01:24:26.061
No, no, no.

01:24:26.102 --> 01:24:27.437
You had one slip.

01:24:31.900 --> 01:24:35.236
I've forgiven you.
You need to forgive yourself.

01:25:29.415 --> 01:25:30.792
You must be Lisa.

01:25:33.503 --> 01:25:35.964
You think you can come
into my fucking house!?

01:25:42.095 --> 01:25:44.097
You know we have friends
in common, right?

01:25:44.764 --> 01:25:45.932
Sadie...

01:25:47.934 --> 01:25:50.103
...is a sweet little thing.

01:25:51.437 --> 01:25:53.481
And Jack? Oof.

01:25:53.523 --> 01:25:55.567
He's a tough son of a bitch

01:25:55.608 --> 01:25:57.068
and a heart of fucking gold.

01:27:45.134 --> 01:27:46.344
That's lucky for me.

01:27:47.512 --> 01:27:48.596
Unlucky for you.

01:27:49.889 --> 01:27:52.141
I used most of the charge
on your lover

01:27:52.183 --> 01:27:54.269
before I ripped
his fucking heart out!

01:28:10.702 --> 01:28:12.078
Hear that?

01:28:15.957 --> 01:28:17.625
This is called a bullnose.

01:28:19.585 --> 01:28:21.838
It's an instrument for savages,

01:28:23.006 --> 01:28:24.007
amateurs.

01:28:27.552 --> 01:28:29.470
It has utility, but...

01:28:31.097 --> 01:28:32.932
it lacks artistry,

01:28:35.518 --> 01:28:36.686
nuance,

01:28:38.062 --> 01:28:39.230
finesse.

01:28:42.692 --> 01:28:43.776
What's the point?

01:28:49.282 --> 01:28:51.284
This one, on the other hand...

01:28:51.993 --> 01:28:52.952
Oof.

01:28:52.994 --> 01:28:54.120
This one...

01:28:57.165 --> 01:28:58.875
...isn't a medium skinner.

01:28:59.625 --> 01:29:01.586
Now, some butchers call this

01:29:01.627 --> 01:29:03.713
a throat cutter
or a gut slasher,

01:29:03.755 --> 01:29:06.007
but that's just naive.

01:29:06.716 --> 01:29:08.217
This instrument here

01:29:08.259 --> 01:29:12.305
is used for slicing
thin-skinned animals,

01:29:12.347 --> 01:29:13.431
like yourself.

01:29:18.019 --> 01:29:19.145
Ahh!

01:29:28.946 --> 01:29:32.617
Whoo!

01:29:37.997 --> 01:29:39.457
Damn, look at that leg.

01:29:40.166 --> 01:29:41.334
I know that hurt.

01:29:43.044 --> 01:29:45.004
Tough little shit.

01:29:45.046 --> 01:29:46.798
It's a shame
this didn't work out.

01:29:48.633 --> 01:29:50.760
I think you and I
would make good friends.

01:29:56.391 --> 01:29:57.558
Fuck you.

01:29:58.101 --> 01:29:59.644
Fucking is not really my game.

01:30:00.561 --> 01:30:03.064
Slicin' and dicin',
that's more my thing.

01:30:03.648 --> 01:30:05.316
Seriously,
what is wrong with you?

01:30:08.111 --> 01:30:11.447
I chalked it up to a cornflake
deficiency as a kid.

01:30:12.990 --> 01:30:14.158
Why the fuck do you do this?

01:30:14.200 --> 01:30:15.827
You wanna be famous
or something?

01:30:16.619 --> 01:30:18.371
I don't much care
for the limelight.

01:30:19.330 --> 01:30:21.874
I spend most of my time
in the darkness.

01:30:22.375 --> 01:30:24.252
But I am gonna think of you

01:30:24.293 --> 01:30:26.879
every single fucking time
I turn on my light.

01:30:26.921 --> 01:30:28.423
You wanna know why?

01:30:28.464 --> 01:30:30.133
'Cause I'm gonna
make a lampshade

01:30:30.174 --> 01:30:33.678
out of your nice, smooth hide.

01:30:35.471 --> 01:30:37.432
Fuck!

01:30:37.473 --> 01:30:38.891
You're dead, you fucking...

01:30:50.027 --> 01:30:51.404
Is that the best you got?

01:31:01.622 --> 01:31:02.874
Goddamn, girl.

01:31:02.915 --> 01:31:04.959
You do have heart.

01:31:12.216 --> 01:31:15.178
I see why your entire
pathetic career

01:31:15.219 --> 01:31:19.724
has been with helpless animals
and unconscious women,

01:31:19.765 --> 01:31:21.642
you fucking pussy.

01:31:23.853 --> 01:31:25.271
You fucking pussy!

01:31:28.483 --> 01:31:30.401
Fucking pussy!

01:31:37.158 --> 01:31:39.243
Goddamn! Ahh!

01:31:47.960 --> 01:31:50.671
No, no, no, no, no! Ah, fuck!

01:31:53.841 --> 01:31:55.009
No, no, no!

01:32:00.515 --> 01:32:02.225
Tit for fucking tat!

01:32:02.808 --> 01:32:04.185
No! No!

01:32:15.655 --> 01:32:17.907
Help me!

01:32:42.723 --> 01:32:43.891
What the fuck?

01:32:45.434 --> 01:32:47.478
Jesus, you got yourself
in a real mess this time,

01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:48.688
haven't you?

01:32:48.729 --> 01:32:51.357
Oh, that's definitely broken.

01:32:53.109 --> 01:32:55.486
You just couldn't leave it
alone, could ya? Huh?

01:32:56.028 --> 01:32:58.239
Hey. You got a smoke?

01:33:00.908 --> 01:33:03.286
You shouldn't be doing this.

01:33:03.327 --> 01:33:04.495
I thought you quit.

01:33:04.537 --> 01:33:06.205
If he couldn't kill me,

01:33:06.247 --> 01:33:08.833
I figure one smoke
is not gonna do it.

01:33:08.874 --> 01:33:09.875
Huh.

01:33:10.835 --> 01:33:12.086
- Where is he?
- Oh.

01:33:16.424 --> 01:33:18.134
Couldn't handle the grind.

01:33:18.175 --> 01:33:19.468
Huh.

01:33:22.013 --> 01:33:23.347
Okay.

01:33:24.807 --> 01:33:26.642
There's the ambulance.
I'll be right back.

01:33:31.105 --> 01:33:32.481
Oh, it's good.
