WEBVTT

00:42.415 --> 00:45.548
Okay. Manuel, right?

00:45.583 --> 00:47.550
This for you.

00:47.585 --> 00:51.488
It's 25 for the vehicle
and 30 for the transport
of the livestock.

00:51.523 --> 00:54.590
Just put down "one horse"
and your signature right there.

00:55.494 --> 00:57.087
You said "one horse"?

00:57.122 --> 00:58.792
Yeah, it's only one, right?

00:58.827 --> 01:00.398
No, it's an elephant.

01:02.633 --> 01:04.930
You mean "really big horse"?

01:04.965 --> 01:07.933
No. I mean an elephant.

01:07.968 --> 01:09.605
Look, sir...

01:09.640 --> 01:11.178
The call said "one..."

01:13.281 --> 01:14.742
What the fuck is that?

01:17.846 --> 01:20.385
Holy shit!
Is that a fucking elephant?
Señor, señor, señor.

01:20.420 --> 01:22.783
<i>Probablemente</i> it was some kind
of bad communication.

01:22.818 --> 01:25.753
Bad communication?
This is a truck
for fucking horses, man!

01:25.788 --> 01:28.624
What do I look like,
a goddamn maharaja?
All right.

01:28.659 --> 01:30.725
And you're invited to the party.

02:07.698 --> 02:08.829
More gas!

02:08.864 --> 02:10.600
Come on. Come on!

02:11.636 --> 02:13.669
Give me...

02:18.170 --> 02:20.280
Fuck! Fuck!

02:35.007 --> 02:37.049
What the fuck are you doing???

02:41.028 --> 02:42.731
Goddamn it!

02:48.233 --> 02:49.474
Motherfucker!

03:22.377 --> 03:25.070
Good evening, officer.
What exactly
is going on here?

03:26.315 --> 03:29.547
Um, well, we're...
I work for Don wallach,

03:29.582 --> 03:32.142
and we're transporting
the entertainment
for a party at his house.

03:33.421 --> 03:35.520
That's an elephant.

03:35.555 --> 03:37.247
Yes, sir.
You got a permit?

03:37.282 --> 03:39.788
Um, I didn't know we needed one.

03:39.823 --> 03:42.021
Can't drive an elephant
without a permit.

03:42.056 --> 03:43.924
Could you make an exception?

03:47.094 --> 03:49.061
How's the guest list
looking for tonight?

03:53.133 --> 03:54.506
It's impressive.

03:54.541 --> 03:56.134
What kind of stars
are we talking about?

03:58.776 --> 04:01.205
Someone said garbo,
I think.
Oh, yeah?

04:01.240 --> 04:02.811
Yeah. I mean,
that's what I heard.

04:02.846 --> 04:04.747
So, we're talking an elephant,
plus garbo,

04:04.782 --> 04:06.793
plus others tonight
at Don wallach's house,
is that right?

04:06.817 --> 04:09.213
That's right.
Sounds like
the best party in town.

04:09.248 --> 04:12.623
My cousin Benny lives in reseda
with his wife and kids.
I'll see if they're free.

04:16.255 --> 04:18.596
Who the fuck are all these people?

04:19.551 --> 04:21.192
Don't ask.

04:48.661 --> 04:50.463
Does piggy like that?

04:50.498 --> 04:52.663
It tickles.

04:54.062 --> 04:56.898
Playtime with potty time!

04:56.933 --> 04:59.670
José! José!

04:59.705 --> 05:04.136
Can you ask wallach
to give us more king bubbly,
<i>por favor?</i>

05:04.171 --> 05:07.271
Okay.

06:35.394 --> 06:38.428
Would you mind showing me
to the upstairs powder room,
my dear boy?

06:38.463 --> 06:40.067
Sure. Uh, it's here
down the hall.

06:40.102 --> 06:42.102
No!
No, no, upstairs.

06:42.137 --> 06:45.072
The stairs are very steep,
I think.
I can be carried.

06:45.107 --> 06:48.779
Evening, madame.
Lovely to see you.
I have to steal him, I'm afraid.

06:48.814 --> 06:50.781
What did you say to Elinor?
Who?

06:50.816 --> 06:53.113
Elinor St. John.
Never speak to her.

06:53.148 --> 06:55.962
If she ever talks to you again,
pretend like you don't
understand English.

06:55.986 --> 06:59.284
The chicken
stole my fucking coke!
Go fucking get it! Get it!

06:59.319 --> 07:01.286
Give it to me!

07:02.960 --> 07:06.225
So, upstairs is where Don keeps
his underage girls, then?

07:06.260 --> 07:07.719
I don't speak English!

07:46.234 --> 07:48.773
Well, that came out
of fucking nowhere.

07:48.808 --> 07:51.842
You'll have to pay
for that, ma'am.
Oh. Okay.

07:51.877 --> 07:53.877
Uh, who are you?
I'm security.

07:54.979 --> 07:56.946
You're kind of shitty at your job.

07:56.981 --> 07:59.487
You have statues
coming out of nowhere,
everywhere you fucking turn.

07:59.511 --> 08:01.478
You're very lucky I don't report you.

08:01.513 --> 08:04.085
Where do you think
you're going, ma'am?
I'm going inside.

08:04.120 --> 08:05.856
I'm Nellie laroy, dummy.

08:05.891 --> 08:07.726
There's no "Nellie laroy" on the list.

08:07.761 --> 08:09.860
Okay, well, I think... come here.

08:09.895 --> 08:13.325
I think what's happened
is my assistant has put me
under my stage name,

08:13.360 --> 08:15.129
Billie dove.
You're not Billie dove.

08:15.164 --> 08:17.527
Okay,
what the fuck is your prob...
What is your name?

08:17.562 --> 08:19.870
What is your precinct?
I'm a security guard.

08:19.905 --> 08:22.246
We don't have precincts, ma'am.
You're about
to not have a job, fucko!

08:22.270 --> 08:24.017
Listen, I know you wish
you were Billie dove...

08:24.041 --> 08:26.371
I think you wish
you were eating my asshole!
Nellie laroy?

08:26.406 --> 08:27.977
They're waiting for you.

08:39.023 --> 08:40.054
I'm Manuel.

08:41.861 --> 08:43.222
I'm Manuel.

08:43.258 --> 08:44.356
I heard ya.

08:46.767 --> 08:48.327
Oh, I didn't need your help.

08:48.362 --> 08:49.801
Oh, no?
Nope.

08:49.836 --> 08:51.770
Billie dove?
Why not?

08:52.806 --> 08:54.399
She's kind of a big star.

08:54.434 --> 08:57.072
Well, in 30 years
she won't be a big star anymore

08:57.107 --> 09:00.372
and she can tell her grandkids
Nellie laroy once used her name.

09:00.407 --> 09:02.748
Besides, I'm already a star.

09:02.783 --> 09:05.245
Ah, you are?
Yeah.

09:05.280 --> 09:07.511
What have you been in?
Nothing yet.

09:07.546 --> 09:09.480
Who's your contract with?
Don't have one.

09:09.515 --> 09:11.724
Okay, I think you want
to become a star.

09:11.759 --> 09:14.991
Honey, you don't become a star.
You either are one or you ain't.

09:15.026 --> 09:16.058
I am.

09:19.393 --> 09:20.524
Oh, great.

09:23.529 --> 09:25.430
Do you know where
I can find some drugs?

09:35.607 --> 09:38.212
We're supposed
to just keep playing?
That's the idea.

09:38.247 --> 09:40.885
It's gonna come
through the front and
just kind of stomp around.

09:40.920 --> 09:43.085
Are you serious?
Just stay
out of its way.

09:43.120 --> 09:44.735
You know I can't afford
to get injured, Joe.

09:44.759 --> 09:46.693
Will you shut the fuck up?
What?

09:46.728 --> 09:48.387
You heard me,
you whiny bitch.
Excuse me?

09:48.422 --> 09:50.389
Come on, you guys.
You see how
he just talks to me?

09:50.424 --> 09:52.633
I talk to you like this
because every time we play
in these,

09:52.657 --> 09:54.261
you playing fucking flat.

09:54.296 --> 09:56.769
If that elephant
drop its elephant ass
on your face,

09:56.804 --> 09:59.068
maybe you'd be home long enough
to fucking practice.

09:59.103 --> 10:00.938
I practice nine hours a day, you fuck.

10:00.973 --> 10:03.567
Yeah, yeah,
but I mean on saxophone,
not cocksucking.

10:05.109 --> 10:06.812
I don't have fucking time for this!

10:06.847 --> 10:08.748
Wake up, wake up, wake up!

10:08.783 --> 10:09.914
What a goddamn mess.

10:09.949 --> 10:12.048
We were just having fun!

10:12.083 --> 10:14.248
Tell it to wallach.
Wake up, wake up.

10:14.283 --> 10:17.350
Where's the Mexican?
Wake up, wake up.

10:18.452 --> 10:20.991
Morphine, opium, ether, heroin, coke.

10:21.026 --> 10:22.663
And Louis xiv sat on that.

10:25.063 --> 10:29.593
Pretend
that everything's fine inside
when all I feel is this void.

10:29.628 --> 10:31.463
And all I do is I give
and I give!
Pedro!

10:31.498 --> 10:33.938
And you, I don't even know,
where are you?
Where are you?

10:33.973 --> 10:37.073
Stop speaking fucking Italian!

10:39.176 --> 10:41.176
No. No, it's not.

10:41.211 --> 10:43.519
I'm trying to have
a serious conversation with you.
Do you understand?

10:43.543 --> 10:46.951
Our marriage is in trouble.
I am unhappy!

10:46.986 --> 10:49.382
Stop it!
You are not fucking Italian!

10:49.417 --> 10:51.923
You are from
fucking shawnee,
you goddamn fraud!

10:51.958 --> 10:53.683
Say one more word.

10:53.718 --> 10:55.993
Say one more word in Italian,
and I will divorce you.

10:56.028 --> 10:58.699
One more.
Okay. Okay.

11:03.596 --> 11:06.300
Get the fuck out!

11:06.335 --> 11:09.039
Get the fuck
out of the car! Go!
Ah! Hey!

11:09.074 --> 11:12.339
Get out! Go!

11:14.013 --> 11:15.177
I want a divorce.

11:32.262 --> 11:34.130
Morning, Dale.
Evening, Mr. Conrad.

11:34.165 --> 11:35.230
Evening.

11:41.975 --> 11:43.634
- Jack! Jack!
- Oh, my god! J.C.!

11:43.669 --> 11:45.471
Natalie!
It's been forever!

11:45.506 --> 11:47.913
Yeah.
I've been saying it
since Wally Reid.

11:47.948 --> 11:49.816
Who needs royalty anymore?
Madame.

11:49.851 --> 11:52.577
Dearest jacky boy,
we need to talk!
I have a good story for you.

11:52.612 --> 11:54.854
I have your face
tattooed on my back.
Well, look at that.

11:54.889 --> 11:56.625
Jack, for fuck's sake,
I've been trying you all week.

11:56.649 --> 11:58.858
Will you just fucking call me back?

11:58.893 --> 12:04.996
Come here, you moola-minting
money machine motherfucker!

12:05.031 --> 12:07.658
Jack, is it okay to grab one?
Hey, Charlie.
How's the missus?

12:07.693 --> 12:10.034
I think she left me.
Hey, me too! Congrats!

12:10.069 --> 12:12.003
Are you okay with march 17th
for the premiere?

12:12.038 --> 12:13.939
No, 18th. Thursdays
are always classier.

12:13.974 --> 12:16.876
Hey, send Charlie
a bottle of bourbon
and get ahold of his negative

12:16.911 --> 12:19.439
and make sure I don't
look too shiny.
Yes, Mr. Conrad.

12:21.949 --> 12:23.377
No Mrs. Conrad tonight?

12:33.785 --> 12:35.158
I'm sorry.

12:36.227 --> 12:37.490
I think we have a problem.

12:39.494 --> 12:41.296
We do?
Yep.

12:41.331 --> 12:44.233
This table only has one bottle,
and we're gonna need eight.

12:44.268 --> 12:45.971
We're also gonna need two gin rickeys,

12:46.006 --> 12:48.908
an orange blossom with Brandy,
three French 75s.

12:48.943 --> 12:51.042
Can you do a corpse reviver?

12:51.077 --> 12:55.805
Gin, lemon,
triple sec and Kina lillet
with a dash of absinthe.

12:55.840 --> 12:57.444
Two of those.
Two of those.

12:57.479 --> 12:59.985
Okay. Two gin rickeys,
uh, three French...

13:00.020 --> 13:02.449
You didn't have to do that,
you know, to get my attention.

13:06.125 --> 13:07.718
I am so sorry,
Mr. Conrad.

13:07.753 --> 13:08.833
I want... what's your name?

13:09.854 --> 13:13.295
Jen. I just wanted you
to look my way.

13:15.035 --> 13:17.035
Jen, I'd always look your way.

13:20.205 --> 13:23.107
Sir, George won't come out of the car.

13:23.142 --> 13:26.374
He's insisting I drive him
off the nearest cliff.

13:27.740 --> 13:28.805
Right.

13:29.544 --> 13:30.642
Be right back.

13:33.152 --> 13:35.152
She said no, huh?

13:35.187 --> 13:37.550
After all we've been through.

13:37.585 --> 13:41.059
Well, to be fair, George,
you did just meet her
a week ago.

13:42.260 --> 13:44.326
What we had was special, goddamn it.

13:44.361 --> 13:47.868
I know, buddy,
but you're not gonna
kill yourself over it.

13:48.893 --> 13:51.366
Save the ring and come on inside.

13:51.401 --> 13:53.401
There's a girl asking after ya.

13:55.636 --> 13:56.668
Yeah?

13:57.341 --> 13:59.044
That's right.

14:02.775 --> 14:04.577
There you go, buddy.

14:07.846 --> 14:10.220
Who's the girl?
A goddess.

14:13.522 --> 14:14.719
No Paris for me.

14:14.754 --> 14:16.226
I'm good.
What?

14:17.130 --> 14:18.426
You've never done cocaine?

14:19.726 --> 14:22.166
Of course I've done cocaine.

14:22.201 --> 14:25.037
Well?
I do cocaine all the time.
I just, uh...

14:25.072 --> 14:26.940
Don't make me do it alone.

14:28.867 --> 14:31.373
Okay, I'll do a little.
Whatever.

14:31.408 --> 14:32.671
I don't care.

14:32.706 --> 14:34.211
I don't know, maybe Niagara Falls.

14:34.246 --> 14:36.950
You know, "Roy," actually,
in French, means "king."

14:36.985 --> 14:39.744
And I added the "la,"
so it's "Nellie the king."

14:39.779 --> 14:41.284
I made that up.

14:41.319 --> 14:43.913
What about you?
Where would you go?
Sorry?

14:43.948 --> 14:47.521
If you could go
anywhere in the whole world,
where would you go?

14:48.854 --> 14:51.393
Uh, anywhere.

14:52.198 --> 14:53.593
I don't know. Um...

14:53.628 --> 14:55.595
I always wanted to go on a movie set.

14:55.630 --> 14:57.696
Yeah?
Yeah. A movie set.

14:57.731 --> 14:59.731
Tell me why.

14:59.766 --> 15:01.766
Why?
Yeah, tell me why.

15:01.801 --> 15:03.537
All right, um...

15:03.572 --> 15:05.979
I don't know why.
I wanna go on a movie set too.

15:06.014 --> 15:10.214
Why? I just want to be part
of something bigger, I guess.

15:10.249 --> 15:11.413
Bigger than what?

15:12.251 --> 15:13.910
Bigger than this.

15:13.945 --> 15:16.517
Bigger than my life.
Bigger than scooping
elephant shit.

15:16.552 --> 15:18.552
Bigger. Better. Important.

15:18.587 --> 15:21.258
Something important.
To be part
of something important.

15:21.293 --> 15:23.425
Something that lasts,
that means something.

15:23.460 --> 15:24.954
I love that answer.

15:24.989 --> 15:27.132
Making movies.
I want to go
on a movie set too.

15:27.167 --> 15:30.927
Or at least I want to be there,
work there, learn there.
I don't know.

15:30.962 --> 15:33.105
I just love watching movies, you know?

15:33.140 --> 15:34.799
I love watching movies too.
You sit there.

15:34.834 --> 15:37.736
And you're watching
the movie and...
And you escape.

15:37.771 --> 15:40.013
You don't have to be
in your own shitty fucking life.

15:40.048 --> 15:42.543
Exactly! Exactly!
You can be in their life.

15:42.578 --> 15:44.446
Or wherever!
Or wherever!

15:44.481 --> 15:46.624
You can be
in the fucking wild west!
You can be in fucking space!

15:46.648 --> 15:48.483
You can be like a gangster.

15:48.518 --> 15:51.255
And people dance in movies
and people die in movies.

15:51.290 --> 15:53.587
And they're not really dead.
It's fucking amazing.

15:53.622 --> 15:55.996
They're not really dead.
Like literally, kill me.

15:56.823 --> 15:58.460
Pow!

15:58.495 --> 16:01.628
And nothing happened, for real,
but at the same time,

16:01.663 --> 16:04.730
it's something
even more important than life.

16:04.765 --> 16:08.767
You can feel it.
Like... I don't know.
Movies are sad sometimes.

16:08.802 --> 16:10.615
Movies are fucking happy.
They make you feel something.

16:10.639 --> 16:14.113
One day, you and me,
we're gonna be on a movie set.

16:14.148 --> 16:16.247
We can have lunch together.
Yeah, for sure.

16:16.282 --> 16:18.491
I don't know what
I'm going to do yet.
It'll be just you and me.

16:18.515 --> 16:20.350
Yeah, you and me.
Yeah.

16:20.385 --> 16:21.978
You know, you're not bad-looking.

16:23.322 --> 16:24.585
Thank you.

16:24.620 --> 16:27.159
And now, the Rose petal...

16:27.194 --> 16:29.260
Of the rising sun...

16:29.295 --> 16:33.462

18:46.531 --> 18:50.632
Fine. Didn't get the part,
but writing the titles on it.

18:50.667 --> 18:53.800
I'm stuck doing
another costume picture,
and my wife's divorcing me.

18:53.835 --> 18:55.472
Want to trade?

18:55.507 --> 18:56.803
No.
Eh...

19:00.138 --> 19:01.775
That woman is something, you know?

19:01.810 --> 19:04.349
She was completely honest with me.

19:04.384 --> 19:05.779
Your wife?

19:05.814 --> 19:07.143
God, no. My...

19:09.884 --> 19:12.390
Jen. The, uh...

19:14.119 --> 19:17.087
Ah.
Listen, I need a favor.

19:17.122 --> 19:20.024
You know my old friend
George over there?

19:20.059 --> 19:22.191
I wonder if you'd go talk to him.

19:22.226 --> 19:25.436
Tell him you were asking after him.

19:25.471 --> 19:27.339
That sad man over there?

19:27.374 --> 19:28.736
Yeah.

19:28.771 --> 19:30.342
Listen, I'm not asking you
to fuck him.

19:30.377 --> 19:32.168
Just, you know, make him...

19:33.072 --> 19:35.215
Feel special.

19:40.486 --> 19:41.980
Okay.

19:44.017 --> 19:46.457
Don't speak cantonese to me.
All right.

19:46.492 --> 19:48.525
Oh, I love this song!

22:09.437 --> 22:11.866
You! I've been looking
all over for you.

22:11.901 --> 22:14.000
We got a serious fucking situation.

22:14.035 --> 22:16.673
There's no exit except
down the main staircase.

22:16.708 --> 22:18.411
Nothing in the back?
No.

22:18.446 --> 22:20.842
You gotta go
through the ballroom.
Everyone will see her.

22:20.877 --> 22:23.042
Is there a doctor?
No.

22:23.077 --> 22:25.275
They're all high down there.
Maybe they won't care.

22:25.310 --> 22:27.981
If we take her out now...
Somebody will care!

22:28.016 --> 22:30.753
She's a fucking kid,
and she looks like she's dead.

22:36.695 --> 22:37.991
We use the elephant.

22:42.096 --> 22:43.667
We bring him through the front.

22:43.702 --> 22:46.868
Everyone will look at him.
No one will look at her.

22:50.335 --> 22:52.269
It's only 2:00.
Don wanted to save the elephant.

22:54.438 --> 22:56.405
Fine. Get the wrangler.

22:56.440 --> 22:59.914
Jimmy, you carry the girl
with me. Then you drive her
to the hospital.

22:59.949 --> 23:02.587
Doubt she'll be able
to work tomorrow.
That's her fucking problem.

23:02.622 --> 23:04.721
No. She's in the bar scene
in <i> maid's off.</i>

23:09.761 --> 23:12.256
Yeah.
Jane Thornton, that's her.

23:12.291 --> 23:13.961
Bar shoots tomorrow, doesn't it?

23:14.700 --> 23:15.732
Yes.

23:17.461 --> 23:20.132
Who the fuck invited her?

23:23.368 --> 23:24.873
I did.

23:24.908 --> 23:27.238
You blimp motherfucker,
piece of fat fucking shit!

23:27.273 --> 23:29.372
It was her first film.
She wanted to celebrate.

23:29.407 --> 23:31.242
I'll fucking... you doughboy!

23:31.277 --> 23:33.585
You fuckhead
motherfucking humpty dumpty!

23:33.620 --> 23:35.785
Bob, come on! Bob!
I'm gonna cut you up!

23:35.820 --> 23:38.381
No, Bob! Don't leave me!
Fuck!

23:49.900 --> 23:51.196
Her.

23:51.231 --> 23:53.638
Whoever she is.
We go with her tomorrow.

24:03.815 --> 24:05.276
What the fuck?

24:18.863 --> 24:21.259
Come on! Come on, baby!

24:32.338 --> 24:34.470
Right here!
I'm right here!

25:20.188 --> 25:23.189
Yeah. All right,<i> kapitän.</i>

25:24.731 --> 25:27.864
Just one more drink
for old time's sake.

25:27.899 --> 25:28.997
Sir?

25:30.231 --> 25:33.331
I just want to say
thank you for the work.

25:33.366 --> 25:37.170
And I was wondering
if perhaps, next time,

25:37.205 --> 25:41.746
you or Mr. Wallach
might have something
for me on a set?

25:43.178 --> 25:44.749
I'll do anything.

25:44.784 --> 25:47.246
I can paint, I can cook,
I can clean, I can do coffee...

25:47.281 --> 25:49.215
You're where you belong.

25:53.617 --> 25:55.056
Okay. Thank you.

25:56.290 --> 25:58.796
Ooh. I'm gonna raise you.

26:00.624 --> 26:03.735
You need to be on set in three hours.
You'd better get some sleep.

26:06.597 --> 26:08.773
Gentlemen.
You have a good night, Nellie.

26:08.808 --> 26:10.038
Congratulations.

26:11.272 --> 26:12.678
Manny!

26:13.714 --> 26:15.010
Ain't life grand?

26:25.253 --> 26:27.616
Oh, if they could see me now!

26:27.651 --> 26:33.259
All the cunts in Lafayette
called me the ugliest mutt
in the neighborhood.

26:33.294 --> 26:35.932
Well, let them see me now!

26:35.967 --> 26:38.000
Can you believe this, Manny?

26:39.135 --> 26:42.037
Hey, Josie! Hey, Nana!

26:42.072 --> 26:46.877
Why don't you kiss
my royal angeleno hooch?

26:46.912 --> 26:48.076
Nellie.

26:52.376 --> 26:54.260
I think I'm in love with you.

27:05.194 --> 27:06.424
Night night, honey.

27:09.594 --> 27:11.099
Don't worry about that.

27:11.134 --> 27:12.804
The car is not mine.

27:26.710 --> 27:28.886
Chico. Hey, chico!

27:30.483 --> 27:32.120
Jack Conrad's passed out.

27:32.155 --> 27:34.155
Use one of wallach's cars
to take him home.

27:52.142 --> 27:55.539
Señor? Sir?
Uh, do you have keys?

27:55.574 --> 27:58.311
Yeah. I have keys.

28:15.803 --> 28:17.198
Damn it.

28:17.233 --> 28:19.464
Ah,<i> musica. Musica?</i>

28:20.533 --> 28:21.873
<i>Sì. Sì.</i>

28:28.574 --> 28:32.312
Imagine me at the opera?
That would've made
ina's folks happy.

28:36.780 --> 28:38.516
Well, if you'll excuse me...

28:46.625 --> 28:48.559
See my point? Come on.

28:52.103 --> 28:53.938
Ina's mom always said,

28:53.973 --> 28:56.501
"I don't see
how you can marry someone
who paints his face."

29:05.116 --> 29:06.709
You know what we gotta do?

29:08.955 --> 29:12.121
We gotta redefine the form.

29:12.156 --> 29:17.027
The man who puts gasoline
in your tank goes
to the movies why?

29:17.062 --> 29:18.963
Why? Why?

29:18.998 --> 29:21.559
Because he feels less alone there.

29:22.969 --> 29:25.761
Don't we owe him more
than the same old shit?

29:25.796 --> 29:28.401
You got the guys in Europe
with the twelve-tone.

29:28.436 --> 29:31.701
You got bauhaus architecture.
Fucking bauhaus, you know?

29:31.736 --> 29:34.440
And we're still doing
costume pictures?

29:36.477 --> 29:38.147
It's the dinosaurs, kid.

29:39.348 --> 29:41.216
It's the ones who go to Beverly Hills

29:41.251 --> 29:43.317
for meatballs and mint juleps

29:43.352 --> 29:45.583
to reminisce about the old days,

29:45.618 --> 29:49.323
when they can't see
there's so much more to be done!

29:52.790 --> 29:55.967
We've got to innovate.
We've got to inspire.

29:56.002 --> 29:59.663
We got to dream beyond
these pesky shells
of flesh and bone.

29:59.698 --> 30:03.667
Map those dreams onto celluloid
and print them into history.

30:03.702 --> 30:07.341
Turn today into tomorrow
so that tomorrow's lonely man

30:07.376 --> 30:09.442
may look up at that flickering screen

30:09.477 --> 30:12.181
and say for the very first time,

30:12.216 --> 30:15.151
"Eureka! I am not alone!"

30:18.354 --> 30:19.419
Yeah.

30:36.768 --> 30:39.406
And I'm going to bed.

31:01.232 --> 31:02.858
Hey, where'd you go?

31:02.893 --> 31:04.530
You need something?

31:04.565 --> 31:07.368
Yeah, I like you.
I want you to take me
to set today.

31:07.403 --> 31:08.864
I want you by my side.

31:11.077 --> 31:13.704
You okay with that?

31:13.739 --> 31:14.804
<i>Sí.</i>

31:16.709 --> 31:19.182
You ever been on a movie set before?

31:20.746 --> 31:21.844
No.

31:23.122 --> 31:24.583
You'll see.

31:25.883 --> 31:28.719
It's the most magical place
in the world.

31:32.593 --> 31:34.168
I've heard.

32:17.885 --> 32:20.560
Liu. We could use your help.

32:20.585 --> 32:22.218
Ok, I'll be right there.

32:27.615 --> 32:28.647
Liu?

32:33.494 --> 32:35.829
Dad got last week's check?

32:36.789 --> 32:40.329
Yes. It was more this time. Thank you.

32:40.364 --> 32:41.924
Hole in shirt before.

32:41.959 --> 32:43.838
No, hole not
in shirt before,
you fucking coolie!

32:43.862 --> 32:45.796
I don't want
a fucking discount! I...

32:53.212 --> 32:54.244
Are you...

32:55.742 --> 32:56.972
I am.

33:36.013 --> 33:37.485
Morning!

33:39.621 --> 33:42.358
Time to go make a movie.

34:11.752 --> 34:13.047
<i>Maid's off?</i>
Yeah.

34:13.083 --> 34:14.554
Come with me.

34:16.757 --> 34:19.230
Higher! More!

34:31.969 --> 34:35.213
Now go over, put it in the pot.
Scream like a big, fat pig.

34:35.248 --> 34:37.039
All right. All right,
all right! Yes!

34:37.074 --> 34:38.150
Go!

34:56.467 --> 34:58.896
More whiskey! More whiskey!

34:58.931 --> 35:01.932
Well, don't just
fucking stand there!
Get the fuck out of the shot!

35:10.943 --> 35:14.681
Peanuts! Good for hangovers!

35:14.716 --> 35:16.947
You. You're new?
You're new here?

35:16.982 --> 35:18.784
Your first bag is free.

35:22.823 --> 35:26.198
One bag or two? One.
And you're paying this time?
Thank you.

35:26.233 --> 35:27.661
Hurry the fuck up!

35:27.696 --> 35:29.993
Can you stop drinking?
We are not shooting yet!

35:30.028 --> 35:31.830
Put down the fucking glasses!

35:34.197 --> 35:36.351
Who the fuck is this?
I asked for the girl
with the tits.

35:36.375 --> 35:37.968
This is who they found.

35:39.136 --> 35:40.938
What happened to the tits part?

35:40.973 --> 35:42.511
She od'd.

35:51.324 --> 35:54.149
Just go. Just go.
Get her made up.

35:54.987 --> 35:56.327
Max!
Yes.

35:56.362 --> 35:57.735
Just, uh, shoot the men or something.

35:57.759 --> 35:59.462
No tits?
No tits.

35:59.497 --> 36:02.025
All right, no tits, everybody!
We're shooting the men.

36:02.060 --> 36:04.863
<i>Diese scheißen</i> fucks!
They are ruining my movie!

36:05.998 --> 36:08.031
I want them on camera in five minutes!

36:08.066 --> 36:09.868
Otto, please, please.
Jack's arriving.

36:11.740 --> 36:13.641
What about pancakes?

36:13.676 --> 36:16.138
Do you heat the syrup
or do you let the pancake
do the warming?

36:16.173 --> 36:19.581
Heat the syrup?
I agree!

36:19.616 --> 36:21.583
Ha. That there
is George munn,

36:21.618 --> 36:25.048
best producer in the biz
and my oldest pal.

36:25.083 --> 36:27.182
Set patrol over there is Jim kidd.

36:27.217 --> 36:30.658
Legend of the wild west
who made his name
killing apaches.

36:30.693 --> 36:32.594
- Lives in brentwood now.
- This is bullshit!

36:32.629 --> 36:35.630
Georgie, what's up
Von cheeseburger's ass today?

36:35.665 --> 36:38.699
The extras want to
renegotiate their pay.
You motherfucker!

36:38.734 --> 36:40.899
Huh.
I do not care
if the extras are revolting!

36:40.934 --> 36:43.066
Well, put the kid on it.

36:43.101 --> 36:45.409
The kid?
Yeah, the kid.
The Mexican I brought.

36:45.444 --> 36:47.312
He's great.
What's your name?

36:47.347 --> 36:49.545
- Me? Manuel.
- Bullshit!

36:49.580 --> 36:52.482
Right, Manuel.
Manuel's great!
Put Manuel on it.

36:52.517 --> 36:54.550
You have experience with strikes?

36:54.585 --> 36:57.014
Um... yes.

36:57.621 --> 36:59.016
Okay, good.

36:59.051 --> 37:00.820
Well, these are all junkies
from skid row,

37:00.855 --> 37:03.015
- so they're pretty violent.
- You fucking assholes!

37:03.759 --> 37:05.220
Who are you?

37:05.255 --> 37:07.728
That's the cocksucker
they sent to screw us!

37:07.763 --> 37:11.369
Gentlemen, I believe
you all agreed to a day's work.

37:11.404 --> 37:14.999
And I believe I agreed
to ram this knife
up the asshole

37:15.034 --> 37:17.408
of the first faggot they sent over!

37:19.742 --> 37:22.512
This is where you kiss
the apparition,<i> ja?</i>

37:22.547 --> 37:24.041
<i>Ja.</i>

37:24.076 --> 37:26.010
She has led you
to your destiny
through fate,

37:26.045 --> 37:28.749
through your lifetime
to this moment,<i> ja?</i>
Mm-hmm.

37:28.784 --> 37:30.245
Very good,<i> ja?</i>
<i>Ja.</i>

37:30.280 --> 37:32.555
I'm gonna play it adagio.

37:32.590 --> 37:36.086
You know, for the music
and the poetry.

37:36.121 --> 37:38.055
All art aspires to music.

37:38.090 --> 37:39.595
I like it.
Yeah.

37:39.630 --> 37:41.289
Sandwich!

37:41.324 --> 37:43.093
What is this Dolly doing here?

37:46.164 --> 37:48.736
Sir! Sir, sir!
Sir, can I borrow that?

37:48.771 --> 37:51.442
All right, you motherfuckers!

37:51.477 --> 37:55.611
Any of you don't work
gets a bullet
in the fucking skull!

37:56.911 --> 37:59.175
Get back to work!
Get back to work!

37:59.210 --> 38:01.144
Get back to work!

38:01.179 --> 38:02.585
Manuel's great!

38:02.620 --> 38:04.279
How's that for camera?
Much better, Ruth.

38:04.314 --> 38:05.654
Jesus Christ!

38:05.689 --> 38:07.821
Is somebody gonna fix her face?

38:07.856 --> 38:09.658
Get her out of here!
Fuck's sake.

38:09.693 --> 38:11.836
Do you not know
how to do makeup?
You, what's your name?

38:11.860 --> 38:13.431
Tim.
Tim, you're fired.

38:13.466 --> 38:15.266
What?
You heard her!
Get the fuck off this set!

38:16.359 --> 38:18.062
Action!

39:00.934 --> 39:05.385
Faster! Faster! Faster! Faster!

39:05.469 --> 39:07.226
Faster, motherfuckers!

39:37.814 --> 39:41.079
"Marbled meadows metamorphose

39:41.114 --> 39:43.719
into the medieval plains of iberia.

39:43.754 --> 39:45.490
Soldiers swarm the fields

39:45.525 --> 39:48.922
like flecks of paint
from a madman's brush

39:48.957 --> 39:51.760
as your humble servant bears witness

39:51.795 --> 39:55.324
to the latest
of the moving picture's
magic tricks."

39:58.098 --> 40:00.296
Oh, why do I bother?

40:00.331 --> 40:02.837
Look at these idiots!

40:07.613 --> 40:09.910
I knew proust, you know.

40:36.939 --> 40:38.070
H-He's dead.

40:39.106 --> 40:41.238
He did have a drinking problem.

40:41.977 --> 40:43.647
That's true.

40:43.682 --> 40:46.111
Probably ran into it himself, huh?

40:46.817 --> 40:48.410
It's a disease.

41:01.491 --> 41:03.326
Your coffee,
Mr. Thalberg.

41:03.361 --> 41:04.635
<i>Gracias.</i>

41:06.298 --> 41:09.332
Close with Swanson
and the fireworks. The end!

41:09.367 --> 41:11.103
Irv!
For the Clayton movie...

41:11.138 --> 41:13.270
Sir, I-I think your tent's
in the line of fire.

41:13.305 --> 41:15.778
They'll edit it out in post.
But I think
we could get hurt...

41:15.813 --> 41:18.143
Jack, every time you wear
a prosthetic, we lose money.

41:18.178 --> 41:20.288
Don't be a pussy, Irv.
The fireworks shot
is too expensive.

41:20.312 --> 41:22.312
And you'll never
get Gloria Swanson.
Why no Swanson?

41:22.347 --> 41:23.962
She only does leads.
She's on the phone, sir.

41:23.986 --> 41:25.084
Thanks, Abby.
Who?

41:25.119 --> 41:26.624
Gloria Swanson.
What?

41:26.659 --> 41:29.759
Gloria? Jack Conrad.
Listen, I need some advice.

41:29.794 --> 41:31.926
You know all the young up-and-comers.

41:31.961 --> 41:35.457
Well, I need a real discovery
for the part in my movie.
Who do you suggest?

41:35.492 --> 41:38.031
Why discovery?
Well, this role requires
real range.

41:38.066 --> 41:41.001
A range I just don't see
in any of today's stars...

41:41.036 --> 41:42.838
Excuse me.

41:42.873 --> 41:47.205
Props needs
better aging, goddamn it!
We talked about this!

41:47.240 --> 41:49.405
Sorry, what... no, I didn't...

41:49.440 --> 41:51.407
Gloria, you have buckets of charm.

41:51.442 --> 41:54.817
This is real drama
we're talking about.
Shakespeare-level stuff.

41:54.852 --> 41:57.347
Hmm. Of course
you could do Shakespeare.

41:57.382 --> 42:00.658
You would be spectacular
in one of his fluffier plays.

42:01.793 --> 42:04.629
Gloria, you're taking this
the wrong way.

42:04.664 --> 42:07.489
Well, I'd like to work with you too.

42:07.524 --> 42:10.228
No, I'm afraid it's impossible.
It's gotta be a discovery.

42:10.263 --> 42:14.166
We couldn't afford star fees
even if we wanted to.

42:14.201 --> 42:16.003
Really? Huh.

42:16.038 --> 42:19.171
Well, how about
I talk it over with the studio?

42:19.206 --> 42:22.746
I can't speak for them,
of course, but I'll do my best.

42:22.781 --> 42:25.177
Okay, then. Bye now.

42:26.411 --> 42:28.510
She'll do it for cheap.

42:28.545 --> 42:32.085
Now take the money I saved you
and put it towards
the goddamn fireworks shot.

42:33.253 --> 42:34.923
Cut!

42:34.958 --> 42:37.420
These fucking horses!

42:37.455 --> 42:38.663
Motherfuckers!

42:38.698 --> 42:39.928
Is that the last one?

42:39.963 --> 42:42.062
What happened?
We lost all ten cameras.

42:42.097 --> 42:44.526
But what about Jack's scene?
We make a camera run
right now!

42:44.561 --> 42:46.198
It's too far!
Sun sets in three hours!

42:46.233 --> 42:47.716
Send Joey now.
Tell him to speed.
In the meantime...

42:47.740 --> 42:49.872
Joey has a flag sticking
through his chest, Larry.

42:49.907 --> 42:51.709
A flag?
He ran into it himself.

42:51.744 --> 42:53.612
Right. Um, send Miguel then.

42:59.147 --> 43:01.378
Here. 1312 cahuenga.

43:01.413 --> 43:04.315
You give 'em that card,
you tell 'em you work for munn.

43:04.922 --> 43:05.922
And hurry!

43:05.956 --> 43:07.516
Okay, here's the shot.

43:09.124 --> 43:11.927
Flirt with the men. Dance.
Get up on the table
and that's it.

43:11.962 --> 43:14.490
Just, uh, don't look
at the fucking camera.
Places!

43:14.525 --> 43:16.734
And camera!

43:27.780 --> 43:29.043
And music!

43:34.149 --> 43:35.445
Action!

43:35.480 --> 43:36.787
Hi, boys.

43:38.956 --> 43:40.692
Santa, get me wet.

43:49.296 --> 43:50.933
Another, please.

43:56.941 --> 43:59.942
That one's for you, snuggle pup.

43:59.977 --> 44:01.339
Hey, baby grand.

44:05.378 --> 44:07.114
Where are you going?

44:10.086 --> 44:12.284
Uh... okay,
start dancing, please.

44:20.393 --> 44:21.931
Bauhaus.

44:21.966 --> 44:23.933
You know what I mean
by bauhaus, don't you?

44:23.968 --> 44:26.133
Not as it relates to this, sir, no.

44:46.353 --> 44:49.552
And then he says,
<i>"hasta la vista,</i> motherfucker."

44:49.587 --> 44:50.685
Type it.

45:15.514 --> 45:18.449
And then he says,
"frankly, Scarlett,
you're a cunt."

45:18.484 --> 45:19.549
Type it.

45:31.266 --> 45:32.364
Cut!

45:35.402 --> 45:37.435
Man number three,
I can see your erection.

45:37.470 --> 45:39.041
All right, tuck it.
Just tuck it up.

45:52.991 --> 45:55.156
Hi. I work
for Mr. George munn.

45:55.191 --> 45:56.960
We need a camera
for strassberger's show.

45:56.995 --> 45:58.962
Oh, yeah?
What kind of camera?

45:58.997 --> 46:00.931
Bell and howell 35 millimeter.

46:02.363 --> 46:06.431
Uh-huh.
Is it a 2708 model or 2709?

46:08.270 --> 46:10.842
I-I'm not sure.
Is there a big difference?

46:15.079 --> 46:16.771
Um, yeah.

46:17.312 --> 46:19.081
Hey, Donny!

46:19.116 --> 46:21.644
What?
There's a guy up here
wants to know

46:21.679 --> 46:25.747
if there's a big difference
between a 2708 and a 2709.

46:25.782 --> 46:27.925
Okay.

46:27.960 --> 46:30.323
Do you have either?
Nope.

46:30.358 --> 46:32.523
Every camera's
been loaned out.
Fuck.

46:32.558 --> 46:34.932
One's coming back
in half an hour though.

46:34.967 --> 46:35.999
Half hour?

46:36.034 --> 46:38.100
But it's a 2709.

46:38.135 --> 46:39.266
Yeah. Okay.

46:39.301 --> 46:40.828
Thirty minutes.

46:40.863 --> 46:43.600
For the 2709.
I can do that.
Thirty minutes.

46:43.635 --> 46:45.437
Two-seven...
Okay.

46:45.472 --> 46:47.142
Zero-nine.

47:07.560 --> 47:09.395
Are you married?

47:09.430 --> 47:12.365
My wife died.
Oh, I'm dreadfully sorry.

47:15.040 --> 47:17.040
Hey! Next part.
Miss Moore'll come in.

47:17.075 --> 47:19.702
She saved you from prostitution,
so when you see her,
cry in shame.

47:19.737 --> 47:22.375
I need big tears!
Big! You got it?
Okay, yeah.

47:23.411 --> 47:25.477
Is that gum?

47:25.512 --> 47:27.545
Are you fucking kidding me?
What's wrong with you?

47:27.580 --> 47:29.954
Five-minute warning for miss Moore!

47:45.433 --> 47:46.828
That's mine!

47:46.863 --> 47:49.006
I have 20 minutes
to be in simi valley.

47:49.041 --> 47:52.801
Which road do I take?
Uh, you're gonna look
at least 90 in this traffic.

47:52.836 --> 47:57.146
We've got an eight-part
sign-out process.
Let me go try to find a pen.

48:01.515 --> 48:03.185
Action!

48:03.220 --> 48:05.352
And action, miss Moore.

48:05.387 --> 48:07.255
Hand on chest. Aghast!

48:07.290 --> 48:08.850
My goodness, what is going on here?

48:08.885 --> 48:10.588
Girl on bar, look at miss Moore.

48:10.623 --> 48:11.996
And tears!

48:14.264 --> 48:15.857
Okay, glycerin.

48:15.892 --> 48:18.167
Um, we seem to be out.
What? We haven't used any.

48:18.202 --> 48:19.597
Porky thought it was lube.

48:19.632 --> 48:21.038
He thought it was lube?
Yes.

48:21.073 --> 48:22.930
Are you fucking... she can't cry.

48:22.965 --> 48:24.925
She's just some random whore
from wallach's house!

48:44.624 --> 48:45.953
Cut.

48:48.034 --> 48:50.595
Hiya. I'm Nellie laroy.

48:51.433 --> 48:53.103
So we going again?

48:53.138 --> 48:54.500
Fucking motherfucker.

48:54.535 --> 48:56.106
I'm so sorry, god.

48:56.141 --> 48:58.570
You gave us the beautiful light,
and I squandered it.

48:58.605 --> 49:00.308
I won't have any fucking light now.

49:00.343 --> 49:03.212
Otto, you should have fought
for 20 cameras, you idiot!

49:05.810 --> 49:07.117
What is this bullshit?

49:15.358 --> 49:17.589
Camera! Camera!

49:17.624 --> 49:18.953
Camera!
Yeah.

49:18.988 --> 49:20.790
Camera! Camera!
Yeah.

49:20.825 --> 49:23.133
My camera's here!
My camera's here!

49:23.168 --> 49:25.135
We roll, we roll!
We are losing the light!

49:25.170 --> 49:27.104
Take two! Action!

49:27.139 --> 49:28.633
And cry.

49:30.307 --> 49:32.670
Cut! Okay, I want
to try something.

49:32.705 --> 49:35.178
Think you could
hold for two beats
for tears gushing?

49:35.213 --> 49:37.488
Eyes water for two,
on the third beat,
I'm gonna do a light effect.

49:37.512 --> 49:39.842
That's when you gush.
Water for two, gush on three.
Yep.

49:39.877 --> 49:42.350
Yes. Okay, let's do it!
Ruth, any notes on my entrance?

49:45.014 --> 49:46.090
You're fine.

49:54.133 --> 49:55.891
Ready for you, Mr. Conrad.

49:59.204 --> 50:00.962
Action!

50:00.997 --> 50:02.964
Eyes water.

50:02.999 --> 50:04.999
Light. And tears!

50:06.541 --> 50:07.541
Cut!

50:13.075 --> 50:14.943
Okay. Forgive the ask.
This is nuts.

50:14.978 --> 50:17.814
But could you, by any chance,
try the same thing
with less tears?

50:17.849 --> 50:19.123
One tear or two?

50:31.401 --> 50:33.665
Let's do this.

50:33.700 --> 50:37.339
'Twas brillig
and the slithy toves were...

50:39.409 --> 50:42.476
Oh, hey. Come with.

50:42.511 --> 50:45.182
Camera's up the hill,
Mr. Conrad.
Over here?

50:45.217 --> 50:46.678
There? Yeah.

50:47.879 --> 50:48.977
We'd better hurry.

51:04.632 --> 51:06.698
There? Okay.

51:06.733 --> 51:08.700
Ah, my beautiful baby boy.

51:08.735 --> 51:10.405
Come, come.
Okay, right here.

51:10.440 --> 51:13.507
Now remember,
you are sad and lonely man.
Right here.

51:13.542 --> 51:16.741
No one will ever love you
but her, and she's only
in your head, okay?

51:16.776 --> 51:18.611
Last looks!
Do I know her?

51:19.482 --> 51:22.318
No. She's in your head!

51:22.353 --> 51:24.551
No, no! No last looks!
No last looks!

51:24.586 --> 51:27.455
Get the fuck out!
I'll fucking kill you!
We are losing the light!

51:27.490 --> 51:29.017
We roll now! We roll!

51:29.052 --> 51:31.085
Roll, roll, roll, roll.

51:40.800 --> 51:41.832
Music!

51:44.408 --> 51:45.638
And action.

52:07.926 --> 52:09.299
Action!

52:10.192 --> 52:11.796
Oh, my god, it's a fire!

52:11.831 --> 52:13.666
Everyone, run!
Run!

52:13.701 --> 52:16.768
Don't stop the camera!
Keep rolling! Keep rolling!

52:16.803 --> 52:18.473
Single tear!

52:21.137 --> 52:23.137
Cannon!
Cannon!

52:27.385 --> 52:28.813
More crying!

52:28.848 --> 52:31.684
Now laugh in embarrassment.

52:31.719 --> 52:34.181
Now look at miss Moore.

52:34.216 --> 52:36.524
You're trying to hide the shame.

52:37.626 --> 52:39.153
Hold steady.
What the...

52:39.188 --> 52:41.694
You're trying to be strong.

52:41.729 --> 52:44.796
You're trying to Bury the pain.

52:44.831 --> 52:50.703
But you can't hold back
that one final tear!

53:49.434 --> 53:50.961
And cut.
Cut.

53:58.410 --> 53:59.442
We got it.

54:14.316 --> 54:15.788
Who the fuck is that?

54:15.823 --> 54:18.692
Camera boy! The camera boy!
You saved my movie!

54:18.727 --> 54:22.091
I love you! I love you!
Yes! Did you see that?

54:22.126 --> 54:23.763
Did you see the butterfly?

54:23.798 --> 54:25.061
That was a butterfly.

54:26.603 --> 54:28.339
Who's writing the titles on this?

54:32.510 --> 54:34.939
I gotta ask you something.
Yeah? Was it okay?

54:34.974 --> 54:38.107
It was incredible!
I just... how do you do it?

54:38.142 --> 54:40.813
Just tear up over and over
like it's nothing?

54:42.212 --> 54:43.981
I just think of home.

54:48.185 --> 54:50.625
So, jacky boy,
how do you think it turned out?

54:50.660 --> 54:53.430
Ah, people want the kiss,
we give them the kiss.

54:53.465 --> 54:56.059
But, madame, I can't help but wonder,

54:56.094 --> 54:58.127
don't we have a higher calling?

54:58.162 --> 54:59.997
We got a lot of great stuff.

55:00.032 --> 55:02.373
We're really excited
about our new discovery,
Nellie laroy.

55:02.408 --> 55:04.837
Is she here tonight?
Can you point her out to me?
Uh...

55:09.008 --> 55:11.679
Yeah, she's the one having sex
with the ice sculpture.

55:11.714 --> 55:13.582
We're all very fond of her.

55:20.349 --> 55:23.790
It needs more punch.
Take two frames off the tail
and three more off the head.

55:23.825 --> 55:25.495
Manuel.
Yes?

55:25.530 --> 55:28.322
I saw Olga putti sing
to herself in Hungarian,

55:28.357 --> 55:30.258
and I think I'm in love.

55:30.293 --> 55:32.645
Send two dozen roses
to her dressing room
every morning this week.

55:32.669 --> 55:34.966
You know she doesn't
speak English?
Neither does love.

55:36.706 --> 55:38.299
Let's do a title here.

55:38.334 --> 55:40.136
"I've been in fashion shows too.

55:40.171 --> 55:42.204
They voted me
the 'least dressed woman'
in Paris."

55:42.239 --> 55:44.239
And when it looks like the guy
asks her something,

55:44.274 --> 55:46.450
have him ask her name
and have her reply,

55:46.485 --> 55:49.915
"no names.
Just call me the wild child."

55:54.757 --> 55:56.823
Do you think she swings both ways?

56:21.949 --> 56:25.049
You're not on the list.
Okay, listen to me.
My name is Nellie laroy.

56:25.084 --> 56:27.282
Still not on the list.
Lady, I'm in the movie.

56:27.317 --> 56:30.021
They clearly cut you, baby.
Is that snakeskin?

56:30.056 --> 56:32.155
Oh, my god! Nellie laroy!
Can I have an autograph?

56:32.190 --> 56:34.465
I once fought a rattlesnake,

56:34.500 --> 56:36.269
and it's against the law to
even deal with a rattlesnake.
Gorgeous! Gorgeous!

56:36.293 --> 56:38.865
There are laws now
because I fought
the rattlesnake and lived.

56:38.900 --> 56:40.768
Okay. You can go in.

56:40.803 --> 56:42.704
Why, thank you.

57:59.475 --> 58:01.651
Naturally, I always knew
my daughter had it in her.

58:01.686 --> 58:03.917
We're gonna do great things
together, she and I.

58:03.952 --> 58:06.447
By the way, the name is Robert Roy.

58:06.482 --> 58:08.284
She added the "la."

58:11.421 --> 58:13.663
<i>It's celebration time for Jack Conrad.</i>

58:13.698 --> 58:15.357
<i>The epic</i> blood & gold
<i>has confirmed Jack</i>

58:15.392 --> 58:17.425
<i>as the highest-grossing
leading man in the world.</i>

58:17.460 --> 58:19.163
<i>And now he's got his nuptials
to toast,</i>

58:19.198 --> 58:21.935
<i>this time</i>
<i>with the Hungarian Vixen,</i>
<i>Olga putti.</i>

58:21.970 --> 58:23.981
<i>One unlucky girl who did not
attend the festivities:</i>

58:24.005 --> 58:27.138
<i>A Kansas teenager who,
overcome by the combined effect</i>

58:27.173 --> 58:29.712
<i>of Valentino's death
and Conrad's fifth betrothal,</i>

58:29.747 --> 58:31.175
<i>slit her wrists at home.</i>

58:31.716 --> 58:33.441
<i>How sad.</i>

58:33.476 --> 58:35.509
<i>Meanwhile, that new favorite,
Nellie laroy,</i>

58:35.544 --> 58:40.019
<i>is making other girls</i>
<i>with California dreams</i>
<i>Roy-ally jealous!</i>

58:40.054 --> 58:42.516
<i>Kinoscope's reteaming
the firecracker from Jersey</i>

58:42.551 --> 58:44.056
<i>with constance Moore.</i>

58:44.091 --> 58:45.794
<i>And you know what that means:</i>

58:45.829 --> 58:49.699
<i>"Moore" delightful chemistry
with constance and Nellie!</i>

58:49.734 --> 58:52.229
This goddamn bitch
is stealing the scene
right from under me!

58:52.264 --> 58:54.165
She's changing the blocking
with every take.

58:54.200 --> 58:56.497
She's icing her nipples
so they perk up
through her dress.

58:56.532 --> 58:58.906
Fuck you.
I ain't icing my nipples.
This is natural.

58:58.941 --> 59:01.205
You're just sore because
yours look like fucking latkes.

59:01.240 --> 59:04.076
And she placed this
in my dressing room.

59:05.574 --> 59:07.816
I don't even know
what that is.
Oh!

59:07.851 --> 59:11.017
Guys, let's just try
a take, okay? I don't think
she meant anything by it.

59:11.052 --> 59:13.019
Let's go back
to our ones.
I need a drink. Whore!

59:13.054 --> 59:15.087
Nellie, back to your one.
Guys, back to your one.

59:15.122 --> 59:16.924
I'll give you something to cry about!

59:16.959 --> 59:18.695
All right, we're going again!

59:21.557 --> 59:23.293
Action!

59:27.035 --> 59:29.706
Stop! She's changed
the blocking again!

59:29.741 --> 59:31.565
Fine. Grab a close-up.
No! No close-up.

59:31.600 --> 59:34.337
To match-cut with yours.
I'm the star!
I get the close-up.

59:34.372 --> 59:38.143
This is my money.
My company's writing the checks.
I decide!

59:39.575 --> 59:41.575
Fine.
Close-up on constance.

59:41.610 --> 59:43.313
Close-up on constance!

59:48.760 --> 59:50.221
Hi, Dr. Lubin.

59:50.256 --> 59:52.696
I think I want to get
that operation we discussed.

59:53.589 --> 59:54.665
Tonight.

59:56.592 --> 59:58.097
Oh, my god.

59:59.969 --> 01:00:03.135
How long will that take to heal?

01:00:12.146 --> 01:00:14.751
What do you say we come in
for my close-up now?

01:00:14.786 --> 01:00:17.116
"Common and uncouth though she may be,

01:00:17.151 --> 01:00:20.548
there's something about her
that speaks to us in a language

01:00:20.583 --> 01:00:23.221
as vital and as bracing
as life itself."

01:00:23.256 --> 01:00:26.488
All right, you heard her.
Close-up on Nellie.

01:00:26.523 --> 01:00:30.965
<i>"Never have I seen</i>
<i>such a maelstrom of bad taste</i>
<i>and sheer magic.</i>

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.132
<i>Your humble servant bears witness.</i>

01:00:34.267 --> 01:00:35.805
<i>She has killed our grandmothers,</i>

01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:37.499
<i>and we thank her for it!"</i>

01:00:52.417 --> 01:00:54.153
How much?

01:01:03.802 --> 01:01:05.131
Jack!

01:01:05.166 --> 01:01:07.133
It's Billy. Remember?

01:01:07.168 --> 01:01:09.036
Yeah. Hi.

01:01:15.781 --> 01:01:18.210
You should come by the warners lot.

01:01:18.245 --> 01:01:19.717
Haven't seen you there in a while.

01:01:20.819 --> 01:01:22.478
Yeah.

01:01:22.513 --> 01:01:25.052
Jolson's sound picture's real good.

01:01:27.683 --> 01:01:29.353
Sound picture?

01:01:29.388 --> 01:01:30.486
Yeah.

01:01:31.192 --> 01:01:32.587
Like <i> Don Juan?</i>

01:01:32.622 --> 01:01:35.062
No, no, no, no. Singing.

01:01:35.097 --> 01:01:37.834
Talking pictures.
Like you're there.

01:01:37.869 --> 01:01:40.364
Not like the shorts.

01:01:40.399 --> 01:01:43.433
Really?
Yeah. It's wild.

01:01:43.468 --> 01:01:46.876
We did a screening
on the lot last week.
People went nuts.

01:01:48.814 --> 01:01:52.607
You, uh, think people
want that, though?
Sound in their movies?

01:01:55.579 --> 01:01:57.183
Yeah, why wouldn't they?

01:01:57.218 --> 01:01:59.020
<i>This is what we've been looking for!</i>

01:01:59.055 --> 01:02:01.825
Sound is how
we redefine the form.
Sound!

01:02:01.860 --> 01:02:04.190
Sweetie, I don't...

01:02:04.225 --> 01:02:07.160
I don't know
what you're upset about.
I don't understand Hungarian.

01:02:07.195 --> 01:02:09.800
I heard warners'
screening last week
was a train wreck.

01:02:09.835 --> 01:02:12.341
Manuel, what's she saying?
I got him learning Hungarian
'cause he's good with languages.

01:02:12.365 --> 01:02:15.080
Something about "getting fucked
by a wheelbarrow of monkeys."
Hiccups are normal.

01:02:15.104 --> 01:02:17.104
Geez Louise!

01:02:17.139 --> 01:02:21.174
Olga? Does this mean you
don't like the rain machine
I made you?

01:02:21.209 --> 01:02:24.144
She missed the rain in Budapest
so I built a rain machine
in the garden.

01:02:24.179 --> 01:02:26.443
Hiccups that last ten years?
Manuel?

01:02:26.478 --> 01:02:28.720
Something about...
Took ten years for
the wrights' airplane to work.

01:02:28.744 --> 01:02:31.118
A horse's cock
and your anus.
Didn't it?

01:02:31.153 --> 01:02:34.253
That's not the same thing.
That's not the same.
Didn't it? Aha! Why not?

01:02:34.288 --> 01:02:35.749
Progress comes in fits.

01:02:35.784 --> 01:02:37.520
Hello?
Spurts and fits.

01:02:37.555 --> 01:02:40.292
Thalberg.
People go to movies
not to listen to the noise.

01:02:40.327 --> 01:02:41.491
Irv?
<i>Jack.</i>

01:02:43.462 --> 01:02:46.364
I wanna know about
the al jolson movie.
Get Manuel to New York.

01:02:46.399 --> 01:02:50.104
Send him to the warners' theatre
to see the premiere
and have him report back.

01:02:50.139 --> 01:02:52.238
<i>Jolson? All right.
Who is that screaming?</i>

01:02:52.273 --> 01:02:54.273
That's just Olga.

01:02:54.308 --> 01:02:56.616
Look, don't stand
in the way of progress, Irv.
Sound is the future.

01:02:56.640 --> 01:02:58.849
Whoa! Hey! Holy shit!
Send Manuel to New York.

01:02:58.884 --> 01:03:02.083
- Jack! Jack, get down!
- Sweetie, sweetie.

01:03:02.118 --> 01:03:04.679
Is this about Greta?
You know she's just a friend.

01:03:04.714 --> 01:03:07.451
Get down! Jack!

01:03:08.784 --> 01:03:11.257

I got the ticket

Nellie! Nellie, I love you!

01:03:27.704 --> 01:03:30.045
I know.
I'll let you know how it is.

01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:31.574
Nellie! Nellie!

01:03:35.316 --> 01:03:37.184
Yes, Jack.

01:03:37.219 --> 01:03:38.812
Yeah, okay. Bye.

01:03:42.092 --> 01:03:43.355
Please, Nellie!

01:03:44.996 --> 01:03:47.029
Nellie, please
can I have your autograph?

01:03:47.064 --> 01:03:49.130
Nellie! Nellie!

Manny!

01:03:59.604 --> 01:04:01.604
Show me your tits, you fucking bitch!

01:04:04.114 --> 01:04:05.410
Right here!
Stop, stop, stop!

01:04:05.445 --> 01:04:07.478
You fucking whore!
I love you.

01:04:07.513 --> 01:04:11.614
No, no, no!
Back off,<i> cabrones!</i>
Back off now!

01:04:11.649 --> 01:04:13.484
Nellie!

01:04:20.757 --> 01:04:21.888
Tony, go, go!

01:04:21.923 --> 01:04:24.396
How you been?

01:04:25.399 --> 01:04:28.367
Eh, good, good.
Ah! Look at you!

01:04:28.402 --> 01:04:30.006
Wow.
You remember me.

01:04:30.041 --> 01:04:32.404
Yeah, of course
I remember you.
How could I forget?

01:04:32.439 --> 01:04:35.704
And you're a star now.
I was always a star,
remember?

01:04:35.739 --> 01:04:37.541
Right, right.

01:04:37.576 --> 01:04:40.544
And, um,
what are you doing here?
Are you here for a movie or...

01:04:40.579 --> 01:04:42.777
No, I had to get out of town
for a few days.

01:04:42.812 --> 01:04:46.088
Some shit came up with a guy
saying I owed him money
in a game of craps.

01:04:46.123 --> 01:04:48.090
Then wallach got pissed.
He straightened him out.

01:04:48.125 --> 01:04:50.257
But he thinks
I have a gambling problem,
which I don't.

01:04:50.292 --> 01:04:53.095
I only gamble if i'm,
you know, pissed or drunk
or having a great night.

01:04:53.130 --> 01:04:54.327
What about you?

01:04:55.627 --> 01:04:57.330
Um, Jack Conrad sent me.

01:04:57.365 --> 01:04:59.068
Jack Conrad?
Yeah, I'm working
with him.

01:04:59.103 --> 01:05:02.863
Oh! I would fuck him.

01:05:02.898 --> 01:05:05.668
Why would Conrad
send you here? God.

01:05:05.703 --> 01:05:08.044
I got out of this place
first chance I got.

01:05:08.079 --> 01:05:10.046
Took nothing with me but my dad.

01:05:10.081 --> 01:05:11.674
He's actually my business manager now.

01:05:11.709 --> 01:05:14.479
He is?
Yeah. He's so bad at it.

01:05:14.514 --> 01:05:17.812
Cannot add, cannot spell.
Why don't you hire
someone else?

01:05:17.847 --> 01:05:20.452
He's my dad.
What else is he gonna do?

01:05:20.487 --> 01:05:22.553
Oh, shit, we're here.
Hey, Tony?

01:05:22.588 --> 01:05:25.490
Can you hang onto this
for me, please? Thanks.

01:05:25.525 --> 01:05:27.459
I'm just gonna be a minute, okay?

01:05:30.629 --> 01:05:32.970
Actually, uh, do you wanna
come in with me?

01:05:33.467 --> 01:05:34.763
Yeah.

01:05:43.180 --> 01:05:45.246
May I help you?
Yes. Nellie laroy.

01:06:07.996 --> 01:06:09.105
Hi.

01:06:16.807 --> 01:06:18.609
Seems okay here.

01:06:20.613 --> 01:06:22.877
It's pretty nice.

01:06:25.321 --> 01:06:26.683
This is Manny.

01:06:28.522 --> 01:06:31.094
He works in the movies too.

01:06:36.563 --> 01:06:38.332
Okay. Thank you.

01:06:42.998 --> 01:06:45.141
That was a waste of time.

01:06:45.176 --> 01:06:46.241
Let's go.

01:06:52.073 --> 01:06:56.812
I hate when people
put fucking toppings
on ice cream.

01:06:57.683 --> 01:06:59.089
Doesn't need it.

01:06:59.124 --> 01:07:01.520
It messes up a good thing.
You know what I mean?

01:07:02.226 --> 01:07:03.819
I fucking hate that.

01:07:05.724 --> 01:07:10.562
God, I've never done nothing
except disappoint people
my whole life.

01:07:10.597 --> 01:07:13.367
Teachers told me I was no good.
Boys told me I was no good.

01:07:13.402 --> 01:07:16.238
Every fucking casting director
in the city told me

01:07:16.273 --> 01:07:18.735
I was too short or I was too fat.

01:07:18.770 --> 01:07:20.374
Usually I was too fat.

01:07:21.707 --> 01:07:23.674
You know, my mama actually
had some fat years too.

01:07:23.709 --> 01:07:26.578
You wouldn't know it now,
looking at her, but she did.

01:07:28.109 --> 01:07:30.615
They fucked up with me, Manny.
They really fucked up with me.

01:07:30.650 --> 01:07:32.650
'Cause I make 'em squirm.

01:07:33.620 --> 01:07:35.422
And I like making 'em squirm.

01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:42.088
Let 'em know that I got here
on my terms, not theirs.

01:07:42.123 --> 01:07:45.729
And when I'm done,
I'm gonna dance my ass off
into the night.

01:07:45.764 --> 01:07:47.731
And they'll know...
Everyone will fucking know

01:07:47.766 --> 01:07:51.438
that they could never control
one goddamn fucking thing.

01:08:07.115 --> 01:08:08.521
Do you like ice cream?

01:08:11.361 --> 01:08:13.163
Of course.

01:08:21.536 --> 01:08:23.305
My family lives in la, you know.

01:08:25.870 --> 01:08:27.100
Really?

01:08:29.774 --> 01:08:32.072
I thought they were in Mexico.

01:08:32.107 --> 01:08:34.041
We crossed the border when I was 12.

01:08:36.947 --> 01:08:38.584
They're not far.

01:08:38.618 --> 01:08:41.147
I could take a car,
drive for 30 minutes

01:08:41.182 --> 01:08:44.953
and just say hi.

01:08:49.696 --> 01:08:51.201
But you never do.

01:08:51.236 --> 01:08:52.301
<i>Sí.</i>

01:08:55.196 --> 01:08:57.470
It's just easier to be on my own.

01:09:01.202 --> 01:09:02.904
I've always been on my own.

01:09:10.585 --> 01:09:14.685
Um, Tony, take Manny
wherever he needs to go.

01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:17.920
Oh, no, it's okay.
No, no, no.
I insist. I insist.

01:09:19.296 --> 01:09:21.187
I'm gonna see you back in la, okay?

01:10:58.396 --> 01:11:01.430
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

01:11:28.426 --> 01:11:32.923
Jack? It's Manny.
Everything's about to change.

01:12:17.068 --> 01:12:19.068
Nell, how you feeling?

01:12:20.203 --> 01:12:21.477
I'm ready.

01:12:21.512 --> 01:12:23.446
Yeah, you gonna
try a take?
Yeah.

01:12:23.481 --> 01:12:25.217
Okay, so we're
gonna pre-roll first.
I'll cue your entrance.

01:12:25.241 --> 01:12:27.219
First Mark is where
you say the line,
"hello, college,"

01:12:27.243 --> 01:12:29.848
and then you head to the phone,
do the rest of the dialogue.

01:12:29.883 --> 01:12:31.718
Sounds easy.
I think it will be.

01:12:31.753 --> 01:12:34.149
Lloyd, any direction on voice?

01:12:34.184 --> 01:12:37.152
Uh, no, we're good
up here, Ruth.
Okay, great.

01:12:37.187 --> 01:12:40.188
Uh, Mark,
can we fix her makeup?
Mark.

01:12:40.223 --> 01:12:43.059
No air conditioning?
It's too loud.

01:12:47.395 --> 01:12:49.230
Okay.

01:12:49.265 --> 01:12:50.935
Just be natural.
You'll be fine.

01:12:50.970 --> 01:12:52.706
All right, places, everyone!

01:12:56.943 --> 01:12:59.680
Uh, hey, whoa, what is that?

01:13:02.652 --> 01:13:05.246
Harry, what kind of shoes are those?

01:13:06.315 --> 01:13:09.690
Uh...
Come on, guys,
rubber soles!

01:13:09.725 --> 01:13:12.352
Okay, everyone, a reminder.

01:13:12.387 --> 01:13:15.388
Rubber soles only from now on!

01:13:15.423 --> 01:13:16.664
Okay.

01:13:17.601 --> 01:13:21.031
And camera! And sound!

01:13:21.066 --> 01:13:24.705
"It's joanne
from 31 grimes hall.
I just..."

01:13:24.740 --> 01:13:27.675
Fuck! "31 grays hall."
Grays hall, grays hall.

01:13:27.710 --> 01:13:29.369
"Hiya, this is joanne
from 31 grays hall.

01:13:29.404 --> 01:13:31.173
I just wanted to see
if the phone worked."

01:13:31.208 --> 01:13:33.549
"Just wanted to see
if the phone worked.
Who is this?"

01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:37.784
- Scene 17, take one.
- Mark.

01:13:41.988 --> 01:13:44.758
Come on. Come on, come on.
You know it.

01:13:44.793 --> 01:13:47.464
And action!

01:14:30.069 --> 01:14:31.607
Hello, college!

01:14:31.642 --> 01:14:33.136
Jesus, fuck! Cut!

01:14:34.502 --> 01:14:36.172
What happened?
She blew the valves.

01:14:36.207 --> 01:14:38.581
- I just need a minute.
- All right, well, hurry.

01:14:39.881 --> 01:14:41.683
Give me one sec.
Christ,
it's hot in there.

01:14:41.718 --> 01:14:43.982
Okay, are we still in places?

01:14:44.017 --> 01:14:45.687
Okay.

01:14:47.955 --> 01:14:50.087
Okay, all set here.
Miss laroy?
Yeah.

01:14:50.122 --> 01:14:53.530
What would really help us
would be if you said the line
a little more quietly.

01:14:56.293 --> 01:14:58.832
- Okay.
- All right, places, everyone!

01:14:59.527 --> 01:15:01.461
And camera!

01:15:01.496 --> 01:15:03.166
And sound!

01:15:04.334 --> 01:15:05.872
Close that!

01:15:05.907 --> 01:15:07.500
Don't you know what a red light means?

01:15:07.535 --> 01:15:09.678
Scene 17, take two.

01:15:09.713 --> 01:15:10.811
Mark.

01:15:11.682 --> 01:15:12.747
Action.

01:15:19.657 --> 01:15:21.052
Cut.
Missed your Mark, Nell.

01:15:22.253 --> 01:15:24.187
- Oh.
- It's...

01:15:24.222 --> 01:15:26.222
Yeah, I, uh...

01:15:26.257 --> 01:15:29.159
I don't know, I felt,
like, a little lighter
on my feet that time.

01:15:29.194 --> 01:15:32.228
I feel I should come
further into the room.
Right, but the microphone is...

01:15:33.935 --> 01:15:35.528
All right. Hey, Lloyd?
Yeah.

01:15:35.563 --> 01:15:38.465
Can we just move the mic
a little deeper in the room?

01:15:39.743 --> 01:15:42.007
Why?

01:15:42.042 --> 01:15:44.075
Because Nellie felt
lighter on her feet that time.

01:15:44.110 --> 01:15:46.748
I was just saying
I think I should come
further into the room.

01:15:46.783 --> 01:15:49.685
Oh, okay. Yeah, sure,
I mean, if you have
half an hour to spare.

01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:52.347
Half an hour?
Well, I can't just move the mic.

01:15:52.382 --> 01:15:54.217
I have to redo all the wires.

01:15:54.252 --> 01:15:56.791
We'll have to reset the rafters,
then find the new position.

01:15:56.826 --> 01:15:59.431
Then I'm gonna have to
recalibrate the whole room.
Okay, okay. Okay.

01:15:59.455 --> 01:16:01.422
Nell, why don't we just...
Is it okay...

01:16:01.457 --> 01:16:04.062
Let's just try one
on the Mark, okay?
You can do it.

01:16:04.097 --> 01:16:07.098
And camera! And sound!

01:16:08.464 --> 01:16:10.772
Scene 17, take three.
Mark.

01:16:10.807 --> 01:16:11.807
Action.

01:16:19.310 --> 01:16:22.245
Well, hello, college.
Cut! No good for sound.

01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:24.698
Well, fucking hell, Lloyd.
Could you just let us
get through one take?

01:16:24.722 --> 01:16:27.701
Why would I do that
if you won't be able to use it?
You told me to do it quiet.

01:16:27.725 --> 01:16:30.924
That's why I did it quiet.
Quiet, not inarticulate.
You can't mumble.

01:16:30.959 --> 01:16:33.124
This is bullshit.

01:16:33.159 --> 01:16:35.709
Are we going again or what?
I can't breathe in here!
We're going again!

01:16:35.733 --> 01:16:37.766
And camera and sound!

01:16:37.801 --> 01:16:40.296
Scene 17, take four.
Mark.

01:16:40.331 --> 01:16:41.968
Action.

01:16:48.174 --> 01:16:50.009
Well, hello, college!

01:16:50.044 --> 01:16:51.571
Motherfucker!
Who opened the door?

01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:54.508
All right, everybody, eyes on me!

01:16:54.543 --> 01:16:56.290
Any other faggots
who ignore that red light...

01:16:56.314 --> 01:16:58.380
You're alternating
the pitch of your voice
too much.

01:16:58.415 --> 01:17:01.152
Okay, can you just...
Lloyd, Lloyd, fuck off.

01:17:01.187 --> 01:17:05.156
Fuck off.
I listen to my fucking director,
not the fucking sound guy!

01:17:05.686 --> 01:17:07.125
Who the fu...

01:17:08.458 --> 01:17:10.964
Mr. Wallach, so happy
you're joining us. Come on.

01:17:21.779 --> 01:17:23.207
Maybe try staying more monotone.

01:17:24.243 --> 01:17:25.473
Okay.

01:17:25.508 --> 01:17:27.508
And camera and sound!
Yeah, okay.

01:17:27.543 --> 01:17:29.147
Scene 17, take five.

01:17:29.182 --> 01:17:30.643
Mark.
Action.

01:17:36.860 --> 01:17:38.189
Well, hello, college.

01:17:47.398 --> 01:17:49.662
Hiya, this is joanne
from gray...
Cut!

01:17:49.697 --> 01:17:53.204
Motherfucking shit!
Cocksucking... what the fuck?

01:17:53.239 --> 01:17:55.041
What the fuck happened now?

01:17:55.076 --> 01:17:57.021
I'm hearing
a high-pitched noise.
Yeah, it's her voice.

01:17:57.045 --> 01:17:58.748
- Do you hear that?
- For fuck's sake.

01:17:58.783 --> 01:18:00.508
Do you hear? That squeak?

01:18:02.446 --> 01:18:04.182
Is anybody wearing a watch?

01:18:04.217 --> 01:18:06.217
No.
No.

01:18:06.252 --> 01:18:08.648
I'm telling you,
I can't stay in there
that long.

01:18:08.683 --> 01:18:10.485
It's a fucking hotbox!
I get it, bill.

01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:12.861
Nobody is comfortable
in here.
Quiet!

01:18:12.896 --> 01:18:14.830
What is that fucking sound?

01:18:14.865 --> 01:18:17.195
We gotta move this along.
I'm so sorry, Mr. Wallach.

01:18:17.230 --> 01:18:18.950
We'll get this under control,
I promise you.

01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:22.871
"Hiya, this is joanne
from 31 grimes hall."

01:18:22.906 --> 01:18:26.072
Fuck! Grays hall.
"I just wanted to see...
Who is this?"

01:18:34.544 --> 01:18:38.150
Hey, count? Count?

01:18:38.185 --> 01:18:39.679
I need a red one.
Yeah, yeah.

01:18:39.714 --> 01:18:41.923
"The" count.
It's just the count.

01:18:41.958 --> 01:18:43.584
Just next time
say, "the count."

01:18:43.619 --> 01:18:45.124
Now's not really "the" fucking time.

01:18:45.159 --> 01:18:47.654
Found it!
It's a pin in Ruth's ankle.

01:18:47.689 --> 01:18:49.524
Did you have surgery?

01:18:49.559 --> 01:18:52.868
If you can just
keep your right leg
absolutely still.

01:18:52.903 --> 01:18:56.036
And camera and sound!

01:18:57.204 --> 01:18:58.599
Scene 17, take six.
Mark.

01:18:59.437 --> 01:19:01.404
Action.

01:19:04.915 --> 01:19:06.376
Well, hello, college.

01:19:06.411 --> 01:19:10.512
Who sneezed?
Who the fuck sneezed?

01:19:10.547 --> 01:19:14.450
Kike-nosed, hymie-hole
piece of mongoloid shit!
I see you.

01:19:14.485 --> 01:19:17.156
Oh, I see you right there,
you little shylock dickface.

01:19:17.191 --> 01:19:21.589
Wipe your nose again!
Wipe your little hook nose,
you menorah motherfucker!

01:19:21.624 --> 01:19:25.395
Now, does anyone else here
need to sneeze? Huh?

01:19:25.430 --> 01:19:28.662
Does anyone else here need
to fuck this scene in the ass?

01:19:29.368 --> 01:19:31.632
Camera! And sound!

01:19:31.667 --> 01:19:33.436
Scene 17, take seven.
Mark.

01:19:33.471 --> 01:19:35.812
Action.

01:19:39.081 --> 01:19:40.641
Hello, college.
Nell, your Mark!

01:19:40.676 --> 01:19:42.709
Fuck this shit!

01:19:42.744 --> 01:19:44.920
Fuck. Lloyd.
It's a million
fucking degrees!

01:19:44.955 --> 01:19:47.824
We gotta move the mic.
Or you could fucking direct her
to hit her fucking Mark.

01:19:47.848 --> 01:19:49.925
But why is it so fucking hard?
You're right!

01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:52.422
I didn't realize
we were making <i> Ben-hur!</i>

01:19:52.457 --> 01:19:55.095
I can move it right now.
My whole year is wide open.

01:19:55.130 --> 01:19:57.427
We could shoot this thing
through fucking new year's.

01:19:57.462 --> 01:20:00.342
Wherever the fuck those
little feet of hers want to go,
I can move the mic for them!

01:20:00.366 --> 01:20:03.499
Okay, calm down!
Get off of me! I dare you!
I fucking dare you!

01:20:03.534 --> 01:20:05.501
Get off the set!
You're good.

01:20:05.536 --> 01:20:07.404
UN-fucking-professional!

01:20:07.439 --> 01:20:09.307
Okay. Okay, Lloyd,
ready to go again?

01:20:09.342 --> 01:20:12.277
You want me to use this chalk?
Make the Mark bigger for you?

01:20:12.312 --> 01:20:14.444
Okay, we're gonna go again.
It's fine. No, it's fine.

01:20:14.479 --> 01:20:16.611
The Mark's right here.
I'm gonna kick
your fucking ass!

01:20:16.646 --> 01:20:19.185
Oh, yeah! Come on! Come on!

01:20:21.057 --> 01:20:24.289
Can we go?
I'm gonna have a fucking
heart attack in here.

01:20:24.324 --> 01:20:27.193
Get back in your fucking box, bill!

01:20:27.228 --> 01:20:28.524
I can't even believe this.

01:20:28.559 --> 01:20:30.658
Everyone, shut up!
Shut the fuck up!

01:20:30.693 --> 01:20:33.936
That's not how we make movies.
Shut the fuck up!

01:20:33.971 --> 01:20:37.940
Shut up! Shut up!
Shut the fuck up!

01:20:37.975 --> 01:20:40.404
Shut the fuck up!

01:20:40.439 --> 01:20:44.507
Now, if anyone
stops this scene again,
I will shit on you!

01:20:44.542 --> 01:20:48.247
I will shit in your mouth,
I promise you!

01:20:50.878 --> 01:20:55.386
Is that clear, Lloyd?
Is that good for fucking sound?

01:20:55.421 --> 01:20:59.258
Now, we are going again!

01:20:59.293 --> 01:21:03.493
Camera!
And motherfucking sound!

01:21:18.114 --> 01:21:20.675
- Scene 17, take eight.
- Mark.

01:21:21.612 --> 01:21:23.381
Action.

01:21:34.130 --> 01:21:36.064
Hello, college.

01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:43.863
Hello?

01:21:43.898 --> 01:21:45.865
Hiya, this is joanne
from 31 grays hall.

01:21:45.900 --> 01:21:48.241
I was just gonna see
if the phone worked.

01:21:48.276 --> 01:21:50.012
Who is this?

01:21:50.047 --> 01:21:53.312
You don't say. The Dean!
Well, how you doin'?

01:21:54.876 --> 01:21:56.843
It's a nice campus you got here.

01:21:56.878 --> 01:21:58.548
So, uh,

01:21:58.583 --> 01:22:01.452
what's a girl supposed to do
once she's here?

01:22:01.487 --> 01:22:03.289
Sure, classes.

01:22:03.324 --> 01:22:05.555
But ain't you got any parties?

01:22:05.590 --> 01:22:07.656
Not till the evening, huh?

01:22:08.956 --> 01:22:11.396
All right, I can handle that.

01:22:11.431 --> 01:22:14.366
I'm from granville, Ohio,
so I know quiet.

01:22:15.666 --> 01:22:18.007
Thanks a bunch, Dean.
See you later.

01:22:21.001 --> 01:22:24.112
Nice fella.
Wonder if he's single.

01:22:32.452 --> 01:22:33.946
Cut! Cut!

01:22:33.981 --> 01:22:36.949
We did it!

01:22:38.953 --> 01:22:42.163
Yes, we did it!

01:22:44.299 --> 01:22:47.135
- Okay, check the gate!
- Billy, check the gate!

01:22:51.504 --> 01:22:53.735
Billy!

01:22:53.770 --> 01:22:54.835
Bill!

01:22:56.377 --> 01:22:57.904
Billy, come on.

01:22:57.939 --> 01:23:00.412
Bill... let's get a crowbar.
Come on. Hurry up.

01:23:03.186 --> 01:23:04.317
Bill!

01:23:04.352 --> 01:23:05.978
Oh, my god.

01:23:10.556 --> 01:23:11.885
He's dead.

01:23:20.995 --> 01:23:22.071
Manuel!

01:23:23.063 --> 01:23:24.601
Meet estelle.

01:23:24.636 --> 01:23:27.406
She's from Broadway.
She's a real actor.

01:23:27.441 --> 01:23:32.048
We got engaged yesterday.
Now she's trying to explain
to me that movies are a low art.

01:23:33.073 --> 01:23:34.446
<i>Mucho gusto.</i> Drinks?

01:23:34.481 --> 01:23:36.514
Double shot of Tequila.
Water, darling.

01:23:39.255 --> 01:23:40.980
<i>Hola,</i> jacky!

01:23:41.015 --> 01:23:42.619
<i>Hola,</i> carmelita.

01:23:43.688 --> 01:23:45.754
I have no idea who that is.

01:23:49.991 --> 01:23:54.059
The point is, darling,
I believe movies are
every bit as profound.

01:23:54.094 --> 01:23:57.029
And with sync sound, which, who knows,

01:23:57.064 --> 01:24:00.032
could be what
the discovery of perspective
was for painting,

01:24:00.067 --> 01:24:03.508
I think what we have here
in Hollywood is high art.

01:24:03.543 --> 01:24:06.214
It's...
Party time, sparkle cocks!

01:24:09.076 --> 01:24:10.845
Hot damn!

01:24:10.880 --> 01:24:13.254
Jack Conrad?

01:24:13.289 --> 01:24:17.654
You are even more fuckable in person.

01:24:17.689 --> 01:24:20.085
Thank you.
This is estelle.

01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:22.087
His fiancée.
Fiancée?

01:24:22.122 --> 01:24:24.364
Hey, I'm not actually gonna fuck him.

01:24:24.399 --> 01:24:26.806
I beat the whole
usc football team at a game
of craps when we wrapped,

01:24:26.830 --> 01:24:29.171
so now they have to be
my slaves for the night.

01:24:29.206 --> 01:24:31.503
Jack, can you say hi
to my dad, please?
Sure.

01:24:31.538 --> 01:24:34.187
He wanted to meet you.
He's also my manager.
It's a good thing we met, Jack.

01:24:34.211 --> 01:24:36.244
I got a business proposition
just for you.

01:24:36.279 --> 01:24:38.543
A Nellie-themed diner.

01:24:38.578 --> 01:24:41.150
I'm gonna call it
"the wild child grill."

01:24:41.185 --> 01:24:44.582
I'm gonna serve sandwiches
shaped like her face.

01:24:47.290 --> 01:24:49.048
It's not a threat,
it's just what it is.

01:24:49.083 --> 01:24:51.490
If you keep playing flat,
I'm gonna fucking headbutt you,

01:24:51.525 --> 01:24:53.690
and it's just gonna be
what it's gonna be.

01:24:53.725 --> 01:24:55.560
You need to play better.
You embarrassing us.

01:24:55.595 --> 01:24:58.068
Joe, you hear what
he just said to me?
Listen to this psychopath.

01:24:58.092 --> 01:25:00.004
When you gonna do something?
Why you worried about Joe?

01:25:00.028 --> 01:25:01.544
Nigga, when are you
gonna do something?

01:25:01.568 --> 01:25:03.139
Have you ever heard
of Alexander scriabin?

01:25:03.163 --> 01:25:05.372
Why the fuck do I care
about Alexander scriabin?

01:25:05.407 --> 01:25:07.605
Alexander scriabin
was a Russian pianist.

01:25:07.640 --> 01:25:10.454
Broke his hands
just so his fingers could
stretch across the keys better.

01:25:10.478 --> 01:25:13.908
I'm saying if I fucking
headbutt you across them
funky-ass lips of yours,

01:25:13.943 --> 01:25:15.712
you might start playing
a little better.

01:25:15.747 --> 01:25:17.648
We can hope.
You're fucking deranged,
Sidney.

01:25:17.683 --> 01:25:20.354
Elinor's trying to
civilize me for talkies.
Ain't that nice?

01:25:20.389 --> 01:25:22.048
"Isn't that nice?"

01:25:22.083 --> 01:25:24.358
Isn't.
And more attire next time.

01:25:24.393 --> 01:25:26.195
A little more attire's
always in the way.

01:25:26.230 --> 01:25:28.230
Nellie dresses low
'cause Nellie is low.

01:25:28.265 --> 01:25:31.123
Now, let me tell you
about the time I fought
a rattlesnake.

01:25:31.158 --> 01:25:33.125
It was death valley.
April.

01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:35.600
Jack? It's George.

01:25:37.373 --> 01:25:38.834
Aw, Georgie.

01:25:39.804 --> 01:25:42.244
Who was it this time?

01:25:42.279 --> 01:25:43.938
Claire.

01:25:43.973 --> 01:25:45.775
Claire.
Well, Claire's a lesbian.

01:25:45.810 --> 01:25:47.810
That's an uphill battle for anyone.

01:25:47.845 --> 01:25:50.329
Come on, buddy,
get your head out of there.
Let's go get a drink.

01:25:50.353 --> 01:25:52.012
Okay, okay, I'll stop.

01:25:54.984 --> 01:25:55.984
I'm stuck.

01:25:56.018 --> 01:25:58.183
What?
I'm stuck.

01:25:58.218 --> 01:25:59.888
Get me the fuck out of here!

01:25:59.923 --> 01:26:02.528
Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention, please!

01:26:02.563 --> 01:26:04.596
For your entertainment this evening,

01:26:04.631 --> 01:26:08.534
miss lady fay zhu
will now choose a partner.

01:26:25.179 --> 01:26:26.222
Hi.

01:26:27.456 --> 01:26:29.588
I'm Nellie laroy's dad.

01:26:31.724 --> 01:26:33.152
What's your name?

01:27:44.665 --> 01:27:46.258
Cannonball!

01:28:20.668 --> 01:28:22.536
You're great, man.

01:28:22.571 --> 01:28:26.166
You call my office
'cause we're gonna
need more musicians.

01:28:26.201 --> 01:28:27.640
And you're talented, man.

01:28:27.675 --> 01:28:29.268
Mr. Thalberg,
it's an honor to meet...

01:28:29.303 --> 01:28:31.380
Yeah, I'm gonna go throw up now.

01:28:34.374 --> 01:28:37.276
Spoke to my friend at kinoscope.
He said the movie's a disaster.

01:28:37.311 --> 01:28:39.454
- Laroy's?
- Yeah.

01:28:39.489 --> 01:28:41.698
They went double the budget
'cause she could never hit
her fucking Mark

01:28:41.722 --> 01:28:44.459
and her voice sounds like a dying pig.

01:28:44.494 --> 01:28:46.758
No, seriously, apparently
the footage is so awful,

01:28:46.793 --> 01:28:48.595
wallach's already thinking
about dumping her.

01:28:48.630 --> 01:28:51.158
I'm not surprised.
She never had any talent anyway.

01:28:51.193 --> 01:28:53.160
Oh, my god. Zero.

01:28:53.195 --> 01:28:57.164
Filthy, slutty piece
of fucking trash
with a nasty voice.

01:28:59.168 --> 01:29:01.036
You meet her dad?
Oh, my god.

01:29:01.071 --> 01:29:04.006
He's even more embarrassing
than she is. Fucking idiot.

01:29:05.977 --> 01:29:07.449
Goodbye!

01:29:08.749 --> 01:29:11.211
Don't come back!

01:29:11.246 --> 01:29:14.313
It's the end, I'm telling you.
It's the end for all of 'em.

01:29:14.348 --> 01:29:15.391
All the frogs.

01:29:45.621 --> 01:29:48.215
Don't be a fucking baby.

01:30:02.638 --> 01:30:05.540
And that, that
is when I grabbed the snake
by the head.

01:30:05.575 --> 01:30:08.510
The big fucking man!
There he is!
What?

01:30:08.545 --> 01:30:11.040
What's he telling you?
What was he saying to you?

01:30:11.075 --> 01:30:12.547
The snake story.
The snake story.

01:30:12.582 --> 01:30:15.341
Come on, buddy.
You got it, yeah.

01:30:15.376 --> 01:30:17.079
Dad, I have an idea.

01:30:17.114 --> 01:30:22.018
Why don't you fight a snake...
A real one... right now?

01:30:22.053 --> 01:30:24.020
Come on.
Okay,<i> no problemo.</i>

01:30:24.055 --> 01:30:26.319
Let's go fight a snake.
Okay!

01:30:26.354 --> 01:30:30.598
Fucking listen up,
all you big-dick mister men!

01:30:30.633 --> 01:30:35.834
Who wants to see my dad
fight a fucking snake?

01:30:37.937 --> 01:30:39.101
Fuck yeah!

01:30:43.547 --> 01:30:45.778
A snake's getting fought!

01:30:45.813 --> 01:30:47.516
A snake's getting fought!

01:30:54.118 --> 01:30:56.250
Yeah, I mean,
chaplin is hung for sure,

01:30:56.285 --> 01:30:59.451
but Gary Cooper...
Gary Cooper is a fucking horse!

01:30:59.486 --> 01:31:03.422
He's also a fucking pussy.
All that cock...
No balls.

01:31:03.457 --> 01:31:05.127
A shame.

01:31:05.162 --> 01:31:07.602
What are the schlongs
like on Broadway?
You want some?

01:31:07.637 --> 01:31:11.001
No, thank you.
Doesn't look that bad, buddy.

01:31:11.036 --> 01:31:12.299
Stop!

01:31:23.785 --> 01:31:25.653
Sweetie, come on.
Please don't...

01:31:27.316 --> 01:31:29.151
Thank you.

01:31:29.186 --> 01:31:30.350
Please, hurry!

01:31:34.554 --> 01:31:37.126
This can't be where we...
Where are we?

01:31:39.229 --> 01:31:41.537
Where'd he go?

01:31:43.299 --> 01:31:45.167
Holy fuck!

01:31:45.202 --> 01:31:48.203
Out of my way!

01:31:48.238 --> 01:31:51.140
No! Stand...
Stand... stand back.

01:31:52.044 --> 01:31:53.373
Back!

01:31:53.408 --> 01:31:55.342
I'm gonna fight a snake.

01:31:58.281 --> 01:32:02.657
Look, sweetie,
he's gonna fight a snake.
Isn't this great?

01:32:02.692 --> 01:32:04.417
Here we go.

01:32:08.764 --> 01:32:11.732
See that snake?
See this man?

01:32:12.735 --> 01:32:13.965
Watch this.

01:32:18.532 --> 01:32:20.906
So, first,

01:32:20.941 --> 01:32:25.845
one must assume
the <i> position</i> of a mongoose!

01:32:31.688 --> 01:32:33.919
I'm not... I'm just gonna...

01:32:35.483 --> 01:32:38.154
Tell me that...

01:32:38.189 --> 01:32:41.696
If I could just've
done the whole thing
over and over and over!

01:32:41.731 --> 01:32:44.831
If I could just
fucking defend...
Yeah... fighting...

01:32:44.866 --> 01:32:48.032
If I could just...

01:32:48.562 --> 01:32:49.605
I...

01:32:57.109 --> 01:33:00.077
Motherfucker!

01:33:00.948 --> 01:33:02.178
Who is gonna fight it?

01:33:03.819 --> 01:33:05.951
No, I'm not onboard.
I'm scared.

01:33:05.986 --> 01:33:07.447
I got practice.
I'm allergic.

01:33:07.482 --> 01:33:11.924
Goddamn it, you fucking pussies!

01:33:11.959 --> 01:33:16.621
You fucking piece-of-shit,
fucking bullshit,
fucking pussies!

01:33:16.656 --> 01:33:20.361
The night is almost over.
I got a 10:00 A.M. call time.

01:33:20.396 --> 01:33:24.431
I just want to see
a motherfucking snake fight!

01:33:24.466 --> 01:33:27.632
Nellie, babe...
Don't "Nellie, babe" me,
you six-foot vagina!

01:33:30.340 --> 01:33:31.746
I will fight it!

01:33:31.781 --> 01:33:33.506
- No, no, no!
- Yes!

01:33:33.541 --> 01:33:35.574
I'm more man
than any of you.
Nellie, Nellie.

01:33:35.609 --> 01:33:37.884
I ain't a fucking pussy!
Nellie...

01:33:47.929 --> 01:33:50.655
See? You see that?

01:33:50.690 --> 01:33:52.459
It's that fucking easy!

01:33:52.494 --> 01:33:54.098
You chickenshit...

01:33:55.167 --> 01:33:56.496
Nellie!

01:34:00.876 --> 01:34:03.272
It's not letting go!

01:34:03.307 --> 01:34:04.570
Nellie! Nellie!

01:34:04.605 --> 01:34:06.473
Let it go. Let it...
Hey! Hey, I got it!

01:34:19.389 --> 01:34:21.829
Help me! Help me!

01:34:22.491 --> 01:34:23.897
Jack!

01:34:24.801 --> 01:34:26.031
Jack!

01:35:02.531 --> 01:35:03.739
Jack!

01:35:04.467 --> 01:35:06.038
Jack!

01:35:06.073 --> 01:35:07.974
Jack, do something!

01:35:08.009 --> 01:35:12.110
Right. Once more
into the breach, dear friends!

01:35:12.145 --> 01:35:13.980
Once more!

01:35:25.092 --> 01:35:27.587
Jacky!

01:35:29.789 --> 01:35:32.757
Help us!

01:35:32.792 --> 01:35:34.264
For fuck's sake.

01:37:01.089 --> 01:37:04.651
Welcome to the wonderful
world of sound!

01:37:22.770 --> 01:37:24.341
I have to do this?

01:37:24.376 --> 01:37:26.046
What do you mean?
It's gonna be great!

01:37:26.081 --> 01:37:28.477
Just stand there and sing?
Exactly.

01:37:28.512 --> 01:37:30.182
While it's raining.
Yeah.

01:37:30.217 --> 01:37:32.349
And that's Noah's ark?

01:37:33.253 --> 01:37:35.550
Uh, I believe so, yeah.

01:37:35.585 --> 01:37:38.058
Because it's raining so much?

01:37:38.093 --> 01:37:40.588
To be honest with you,
I don't really know
why it's Noah's ark.

01:37:40.623 --> 01:37:42.326
Georgie.
Come on, come on.

01:37:42.361 --> 01:37:44.130
No. No.
What? This is...

01:37:44.165 --> 01:37:46.825
Norma's here.
Buster Keaton's here.
George, no. No.

01:37:46.860 --> 01:37:48.761
The song's a hit.

01:37:48.796 --> 01:37:50.367
You love to sing.

01:37:50.402 --> 01:37:54.107
Oh, I hate you.
I hate you.
Come on.

01:37:54.142 --> 01:37:56.538
Just don't
let Olga shoot me.
Okay.

01:38:28.242 --> 01:38:30.341
Cut! Cut!

01:38:30.376 --> 01:38:33.377
Musicians, you're on a break.
I wanna work with my actors
for a second.

01:38:33.412 --> 01:38:35.984
The head bobbing,
it's very mechanical right now.

01:38:36.019 --> 01:38:39.548
Think of something
that makes it personal
to you. Okay?

01:38:39.583 --> 01:38:42.221
That's a little too much, Mary.
That's too personal. Okay?

01:38:42.256 --> 01:38:44.553
So just bobbing, all right?
Let's work on that.

01:38:44.588 --> 01:38:47.028
Up. Up. Rest of the body
doesn't move.

01:38:47.063 --> 01:38:49.756
Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up.

01:38:49.791 --> 01:38:53.760
Very good, Mary.
Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up.

01:38:53.795 --> 01:38:56.433
Oh, I like this.
Isolate the shoulders.
What do you think?

01:38:56.468 --> 01:38:59.139
Up. Up. Up.
Up. Up. Up.

01:38:59.174 --> 01:39:00.965
You're asking me what I think?

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:02.373
Okay.
Yeah.

01:39:02.408 --> 01:39:04.144
This looks so much better.

01:39:04.179 --> 01:39:06.157
I think you got
those cameras pointed
in the wrong direction.

01:39:06.181 --> 01:39:08.016
Do the rainbow, remember?
Big arms!

01:39:08.051 --> 01:39:10.392
That's what I think.
Take this one more time.
Everybody ready?

01:39:10.416 --> 01:39:12.548
Musicians are ready?
And action!

01:39:20.360 --> 01:39:22.327
Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up.

01:39:22.362 --> 01:39:24.131
Up. Up.

01:39:24.166 --> 01:39:26.727
Bob. Bob. Bob.
Bob. Bob. That's better.

01:39:30.271 --> 01:39:32.799
Good. Good, good, Candace.
Very good.

01:39:34.869 --> 01:39:38.970
Yeah, it's coming together.
This is much better.
Remember that energy.

01:39:54.955 --> 01:39:57.065
Cut!

01:40:03.172 --> 01:40:04.534
Good idea.

01:40:24.853 --> 01:40:26.391
Manuel torres.

01:40:28.230 --> 01:40:29.724
How have you been?

01:40:30.496 --> 01:40:32.760
Uh, well, sir. And you?

01:40:35.171 --> 01:40:37.061
Y-You want to talk
with Mr. Thalberg?

01:40:37.096 --> 01:40:39.206
Were these sid Palmer shorts
your idea?

01:40:41.540 --> 01:40:44.904
They're more
like a collaboration
between Sidney and me.

01:40:44.939 --> 01:40:47.412
Uh-huh.
How'd you like to leave mgm,

01:40:47.447 --> 01:40:49.040
come be sound chief at kinoscope?

01:40:50.879 --> 01:40:52.780
What?

01:40:52.815 --> 01:40:55.585
We need
Spanish-language pictures.
We're taking new directions.

01:40:55.620 --> 01:40:57.851
It's changing times, Manny.
I'm honored, sir, but...

01:40:57.886 --> 01:41:00.260
And we need to do something
about Nellie laroy.

01:41:01.494 --> 01:41:02.790
Oh, yeah.

01:41:03.661 --> 01:41:05.364
You know her, don't you?

01:41:06.598 --> 01:41:09.060
The Jersey thing doesn't work anymore.

01:41:09.095 --> 01:41:11.799
Today's audiences
find her pornographic.

01:41:11.834 --> 01:41:14.802
She's been hanging around
Jim McKay's casinos
like a half-wit.

01:41:14.837 --> 01:41:17.574
She owes gambling debts all over town.

01:41:17.609 --> 01:41:19.477
And she sounds like a donkey.

01:41:20.216 --> 01:41:21.248
I mean...

01:41:23.219 --> 01:41:24.284
Anyways...

01:41:25.485 --> 01:41:26.781
Think about it.

01:41:35.154 --> 01:41:36.890
<i>Gentlemen, here's the plan.</i>

01:41:36.925 --> 01:41:40.465
We turn Nellie laroy into a lady.

01:41:40.500 --> 01:41:43.534
We change her parts.
We fix her voice.

01:41:43.569 --> 01:41:45.701
No more drugs.
No more gambling.

01:41:45.736 --> 01:41:49.738
Elinor St. John
writes a story about
her amazing transformation.

01:41:49.773 --> 01:41:52.444
With the right endorsements,
and with Elinor as an ally,

01:41:52.479 --> 01:41:57.141
we can remake miss laroy
into an actress
of sophistication.

01:41:57.176 --> 01:41:58.648
Like the ladies of mgm.

01:41:58.683 --> 01:42:00.815
Next, Sidney Palmer.
Today's white audiences

01:42:00.850 --> 01:42:02.322
want negroes in their pictures.

01:42:02.357 --> 01:42:03.917
Negro music, negro voices.

01:42:03.952 --> 01:42:06.524
So we bring Sidney to kinoscope,
whatever he costs.

01:42:10.365 --> 01:42:11.958
One moment, gentlemen.
One moment.

01:42:11.993 --> 01:42:14.367
Um, Sidney Palmer, okay?
Sidney Palmer.

01:42:34.147 --> 01:42:36.653
I was hoping I could introduce
the two of you.

01:42:36.688 --> 01:42:39.150
Miss laroy, meet Mr. Torres.

01:42:39.185 --> 01:42:40.855
Mr. Torres,
meet miss laroy.

01:42:40.890 --> 01:42:44.089
Mr. Torres is gonna be
working for us
here at kinoscope.

01:42:48.667 --> 01:42:50.194
Hi, Mr. Torres.

01:42:50.229 --> 01:42:51.712
Just want you to know
that I'm ready to change,

01:42:51.736 --> 01:42:53.703
and I'll do whatever you need.

01:42:57.071 --> 01:42:58.312
Call me Manny.

01:42:59.040 --> 01:43:00.248
<i>Cut!</i>

01:43:00.283 --> 01:43:02.382
Beautiful.
<i>Bellísimo, bellísimo.</i>

01:43:02.417 --> 01:43:04.615
Next time, try softer, okay?

01:43:04.650 --> 01:43:07.486
"But why, my darling Pierre?
Why?"

01:43:07.521 --> 01:43:09.213
Walt! Walt, hey!

01:43:09.248 --> 01:43:11.424
Move that microphone 45 degrees, okay?

01:43:11.459 --> 01:43:14.559
That one near her, okay?

01:43:14.594 --> 01:43:16.891
<i>- Amigo,</i> no, no, no.
- Hey...<i> Amigo!</i>

01:43:16.926 --> 01:43:19.498
It's not "Manuel,"
it's "Manny."
Manny torres.

01:43:19.533 --> 01:43:21.335
- Not Manuel, okay?
- Phone for you, sir!

01:43:21.370 --> 01:43:22.963
Yeah.

01:43:22.998 --> 01:43:24.338
- Manny torres.
<i>- Manuel.</i>

01:43:24.373 --> 01:43:27.231
<i>Moving up fast.</i>
Jack? I'm sorry.

01:43:27.266 --> 01:43:29.167
I meant to call you.
The reds chill her out.

01:43:29.202 --> 01:43:31.147
Blues keep her skinny.
<i>Don't say a word.</i>
<i>I'm happy for you.</i>

01:43:31.171 --> 01:43:33.391
<i>You deserve this.
</i> Did you see my screen test yet, Manny?

01:43:33.415 --> 01:43:35.877
<i>Now go show</i>
<i>those fat fucks</i>
<i>how it's done.</i>

01:43:39.179 --> 01:43:41.619
Okay! Okay!

01:43:41.654 --> 01:43:44.754
Let's roll, people!
Let's go! Take two!

01:43:44.789 --> 01:43:48.659
"Pierre, who is the fella
to whom you are speaking?"

01:43:48.694 --> 01:43:50.892
"Who is the fellow..."
Fellow.

01:43:50.927 --> 01:43:52.597
Fellow. Fuck.
Fellow.

01:43:52.632 --> 01:43:54.632
Welcome to your new home,
Mr. Palmer.

01:44:03.940 --> 01:44:05.808
And your car.

01:44:07.075 --> 01:44:08.745
A gift from
Mr. Wallach.

01:44:13.950 --> 01:44:16.786
And that finishes at 5:30,
leaving you enough time
to make the gala.

01:44:16.821 --> 01:44:18.502
And a hearst invite
has come in
for miss laroy.

01:44:18.526 --> 01:44:20.790
Only question is,
what do we do about fay zhu?

01:44:23.597 --> 01:44:25.630
It won't help Nellie
with the hearst crowd.

01:44:38.942 --> 01:44:41.272
"Listen to me, Catherine.
I don't care if they find us.

01:44:41.307 --> 01:44:44.385
They could strip me of my rank
and it wouldn't change
how I feel."

01:44:44.420 --> 01:44:47.311
Latest voice tests:
Conrad nagel, rich tone.

01:44:47.346 --> 01:44:49.049
William Haines, good consonants.

01:44:49.084 --> 01:44:51.084
You're messing with Nellie's career,

01:44:51.119 --> 01:44:54.593
and we're trying so hard
to get it back on track.

01:44:54.628 --> 01:44:57.288
There's a new sensibility now.

01:44:57.323 --> 01:44:59.664
People care about morals.

01:44:59.699 --> 01:45:03.437
"I've known loss.
I've known pain.
You're what gives me life."

01:45:03.472 --> 01:45:05.637
Try accenting "you"
a little more,
darling.

01:45:05.672 --> 01:45:07.507
"You are what gives me life."

01:45:08.136 --> 01:45:10.004
Just a suggestion.

01:45:10.039 --> 01:45:13.271
Marion Davies stutters a bit.
Maybe supporting roles
from now on?

01:45:13.306 --> 01:45:15.141
This sort of thing
is no longer acceptable.

01:45:15.176 --> 01:45:18.485
"You are what gives me life."
Maybe try it slower.

01:45:18.520 --> 01:45:21.554
Ramon novarro can play guitar,
but south-of-the-border accent.

01:45:23.756 --> 01:45:27.824
What I'm trying to say
is kinoscope can no longer
employ you.

01:45:31.533 --> 01:45:35.029
Your image is not helpful,
and we don't
need titles anymore.

01:45:37.968 --> 01:45:39.330
That's it.

01:45:42.071 --> 01:45:43.510
I'm sorry.

01:45:54.721 --> 01:45:58.624
<i>Jack Conrad has a good voice,
is our biggest asset.</i>

01:45:58.659 --> 01:46:00.461
Also the most expensive.

01:46:00.496 --> 01:46:03.354
- Yeah?
<i>- "You are what gives me life.</i>

01:46:03.389 --> 01:46:05.224
<i>I love you."</i>

01:46:05.259 --> 01:46:07.963
Then what I'd suggest there
would be to...

01:46:09.703 --> 01:46:11.329
Hello?
<i>Jack, it's Irv.</i>

01:46:11.364 --> 01:46:13.474
<i>Listen, there's no good way
to say this...</i>

01:46:13.509 --> 01:46:15.333
<i>They found George in his home
this morning.</i>

01:46:15.368 --> 01:46:18.006
<i>Looks like he struck out
with a girl he was seeing.</i>

01:46:18.041 --> 01:46:19.447
<i>He shot himself.</i>

01:46:22.045 --> 01:46:23.110
<i>Jack?</i>

01:46:25.411 --> 01:46:26.520
Thank you.

01:46:33.287 --> 01:46:38.158
So, what I would suggest there
would be to play subtext
rather than...

01:46:41.031 --> 01:46:42.393
Honey?

01:46:42.428 --> 01:46:44.131
Are you okay?

01:46:45.673 --> 01:46:48.333
He was the first one
to say I have talent.

01:46:49.941 --> 01:46:51.578
He saved my life.

01:46:52.438 --> 01:46:53.547
Who?

01:46:58.444 --> 01:47:00.851
It's not a low art, you know.

01:47:00.886 --> 01:47:02.787
I want you to know that.

01:47:04.593 --> 01:47:07.660
What I do means something
to millions of people.

01:47:07.695 --> 01:47:11.961
My folks didn't have the money
or the education
to go to the theater,

01:47:11.996 --> 01:47:14.997
so they went
to the vaudeville houses,
and then the nickelodeons.

01:47:15.032 --> 01:47:18.198
And you know what?
There's beauty there.

01:47:19.641 --> 01:47:22.906
What happens up on that screen
means something.

01:47:22.941 --> 01:47:26.107
Maybe not to you in your ivory tower.

01:47:26.142 --> 01:47:30.485
But for real people
on the ground,
it means something.

01:47:32.786 --> 01:47:35.985
Jack, I-I have no idea
what you're talking about.

01:47:36.020 --> 01:47:37.525
Of course you don't.

01:47:37.560 --> 01:47:39.890
Of course you don't!

01:47:39.925 --> 01:47:42.728
A hundred thousand people
see you on Broadway,

01:47:42.763 --> 01:47:45.324
and it's the smash
of the century, right?

01:47:46.162 --> 01:47:47.700
Well, here it's a flop!

01:47:49.033 --> 01:47:50.802
A fucking flop!

01:47:50.837 --> 01:47:54.135
So do me a favor, darling.
Save your subtext
recommendations

01:47:54.170 --> 01:47:57.842
for your pretentious
Eugene O'Neill-Henrik ibsen
jerk-offs

01:47:57.877 --> 01:48:01.373
that only a handful
of rich geriatrics
give two fucks about,

01:48:01.408 --> 01:48:04.145
and I'll do what I do
without your help!

01:48:30.239 --> 01:48:32.943
<i>Listen, Catherine.
I don't care if they find us.</i>

01:48:32.978 --> 01:48:36.144
<i>They could strip me of my rank</i>
<i>and it wouldn't change</i>
<i>how I feel.</i>

01:48:36.179 --> 01:48:38.586
<i>I've known loss.
I've known pain.</i>

01:48:40.018 --> 01:48:42.282
<i>It's you who gives me life.</i>

01:48:43.857 --> 01:48:45.219
<i>I love you.</i>

01:48:53.262 --> 01:48:55.493
You think it works?
It's great.

01:48:56.166 --> 01:48:57.528
It's a winner, Jack.

01:48:57.563 --> 01:48:59.200
You think it works?

01:49:06.011 --> 01:49:07.912
I wish George could've seen it.

01:49:08.882 --> 01:49:10.112
Yes.

01:49:13.216 --> 01:49:15.821
Mr. Conrad,
you're gonna miss your train.

01:49:15.856 --> 01:49:16.921
Christ!

01:49:17.583 --> 01:49:19.583
Ah, fuck.

01:49:19.618 --> 01:49:22.927
I'm off to repair my marriage.
I'll see you bastards
in a month.

01:49:22.962 --> 01:49:24.456
Good luck with that.

01:49:27.527 --> 01:49:29.395
Okay, don't forget.

01:49:29.430 --> 01:49:32.299
Your friend Manuel
pulled a lot of strings
to get you in here.

01:49:32.334 --> 01:49:34.598
These people choose
who stays and who goes.

01:49:34.633 --> 01:49:36.600
So show them that you're
a lady of sophistication

01:49:36.635 --> 01:49:38.206
and you'll be back on top.

01:49:38.241 --> 01:49:39.944
So, now what did we discuss?

01:49:39.979 --> 01:49:42.408
"-Ing" not "-in."

01:49:42.443 --> 01:49:44.179
"Isn't" not "ain't."

01:49:44.214 --> 01:49:46.445
And when in doubt,
say somethin' French.

01:49:46.480 --> 01:49:47.952
Perfection!

01:49:47.987 --> 01:49:51.186
Also, no drinking,
and try not to eat too much.

01:49:52.156 --> 01:49:54.090
Billy! Marion!

01:49:54.125 --> 01:49:56.092
Oh, Elinor!
Hello.

01:49:56.127 --> 01:50:00.162
May I please present to you
miss Nellie laroy.

01:50:00.197 --> 01:50:02.736
How do you do?
<i>Enchantée.</i>

01:50:02.771 --> 01:50:04.265
Good evening, miss laroy.

01:50:07.776 --> 01:50:09.644
Nell, I'd like you
to also meet Mildred yates.

01:50:10.273 --> 01:50:11.811
Sir delmer lunny.

01:50:12.814 --> 01:50:15.474
And Jonathan and Harriet rothschild.

01:50:15.509 --> 01:50:17.443
Pleasure.

01:50:17.478 --> 01:50:19.852
Gerald,
have you heard about
the new Ellis engel picture?

01:50:19.887 --> 01:50:21.579
It sounds just awful.

01:50:21.614 --> 01:50:24.153
Yes, I've spoken
to l.B. About it already.

01:50:24.188 --> 01:50:26.826
There'll be no more
of that kind of thing,
I can assure you.

01:50:26.861 --> 01:50:31.589
Here we have a <i> pâté de campagne</i>
designed by krümt
with a takagei bubble.

01:50:31.624 --> 01:50:36.363
I hear it's strindberg season
in New York.
Do you like <i> miss Julie?</i>

01:50:37.432 --> 01:50:41.467
Yes, she is lovely and very talented.

01:51:03.326 --> 01:51:05.062
Sidney.
Manny.

01:51:14.777 --> 01:51:16.304
All right.

01:51:16.339 --> 01:51:19.813
Billy, is your new rug really a klikó?

01:51:19.848 --> 01:51:22.816
I got it last spring.
One of a kind.

01:51:22.851 --> 01:51:24.114
Mr. Palmer.

01:51:24.149 --> 01:51:26.314
It is truly an honor to meet you.

01:51:26.349 --> 01:51:28.822
Teddy and I
saw <i> cottage blues</i> last week.

01:51:28.857 --> 01:51:30.384
Genius!

01:51:31.189 --> 01:51:32.254
Thanks.

01:51:36.581 --> 01:51:38.922
Do you play bridge, miss laroy?

01:51:41.694 --> 01:51:45.785
The bread speaks
English with the dog young.

01:51:55.675 --> 01:51:57.213
You're from Mexico, then?

01:51:57.248 --> 01:51:59.248
Uh, Spain. Madrid.

01:52:00.020 --> 01:52:02.185
Spain. Madrid.

01:52:02.220 --> 01:52:04.220
How did you get into music,
Mr. Palmer?

01:52:04.255 --> 01:52:07.256
Uh, I taught myself, mostly.

01:52:07.291 --> 01:52:10.996
Incredible.
Who are your influences?

01:52:11.031 --> 01:52:13.526
Uh, scriabin.

01:52:13.561 --> 01:52:15.099
I like rachmaninoff.

01:52:20.139 --> 01:52:25.109
Do you think George eliot
was better as a novelist
or a poet, Nell?

01:52:27.245 --> 01:52:30.378
I think he was marvelous,
marvelous at both.

01:52:30.413 --> 01:52:36.087
Now I do apologize,
but I must resign briefly
to the powder room.

01:52:36.122 --> 01:52:38.452
I shan't be long. Ta-ta!

01:52:38.487 --> 01:52:41.895
Everything you need,
you know, right here.
It's got the restaurants and...

01:52:41.930 --> 01:52:45.261
Of course,
now you can't gamble in la.
You been to Cal-neva?

01:52:45.296 --> 01:52:48.066
This one guy McKay
owns a few joints,
but he's a little scary, so...

01:52:48.101 --> 01:52:50.167
One moment, please.
Oh, sure.

01:52:52.732 --> 01:52:55.403
Jack! Didn't think
you'd get in in time.
How was Europe?

01:52:55.438 --> 01:52:57.911
Inspiring! Di...
And congrats
on the new film.

01:52:57.946 --> 01:52:59.671
Opens tonight,
right?
Correct.

01:52:59.706 --> 01:53:02.740
Did you know
Michelangelo painted
the entire sistine chapel

01:53:02.775 --> 01:53:03.950
on his back?

01:53:03.985 --> 01:53:06.150
Manny! How's our girl doing?

01:53:06.185 --> 01:53:09.219
Oh, she's doing great.
Perfect.
Okay, good.

01:53:11.960 --> 01:53:13.289
Manny, I need to go home.

01:53:13.324 --> 01:53:15.093
You cannot go home.
I can't do this.

01:53:15.128 --> 01:53:16.666
You're going back out there.
I'm having a heart attack.

01:53:16.690 --> 01:53:18.899
Elinor and I worked so hard
to get you into this.

01:53:18.934 --> 01:53:21.198
Manny,
I am dying out there.
Okay, okay.

01:53:21.233 --> 01:53:23.530
They're a bunch of...
They're awful.

01:53:23.565 --> 01:53:27.006
Mildred's got a fucking rabbit
on her shoulders
that's probably still alive.

01:53:27.041 --> 01:53:28.502
Hey.
The ass-pincher!

01:53:28.537 --> 01:53:30.020
They can save your career.
They don't like me!

01:53:30.044 --> 01:53:32.011
If they like you...
They don't!

01:53:32.046 --> 01:53:34.156
We get the right director,
the right publicity...
What about Ruth?

01:53:34.180 --> 01:53:36.125
I need Ruth back.
Ruth doesn't fucking cut it
anymore!

01:53:36.149 --> 01:53:38.380
Listen to me,
I'm here for you.
It's you and me.

01:53:38.415 --> 01:53:41.449
You could be a star again,
Nellie. Again.
It's you and me.

01:53:43.519 --> 01:53:45.288
You look beautiful, okay?

01:53:45.323 --> 01:53:47.961
I look fucking ridiculous.
What's your name?

01:53:47.996 --> 01:53:50.557
Nellie laroy.
Perfect. Once again.

01:53:50.592 --> 01:53:53.461
Nellie laroy.
In French.

01:53:53.496 --> 01:53:56.904
It is French already!
Okay, let's go.

01:53:56.939 --> 01:53:58.565
"Roy" means "king," remember?

01:54:01.834 --> 01:54:02.910
Beautiful.

01:54:04.045 --> 01:54:06.672
Jack.
It's great to see you.

01:54:06.707 --> 01:54:08.311
You, too.<i> Salud.</i>

01:54:09.380 --> 01:54:10.984
Are you holding up?

01:54:14.715 --> 01:54:16.484
Well, I do miss him.

01:54:18.554 --> 01:54:19.784
Miss him?

01:54:20.490 --> 01:54:21.621
George.

01:54:22.591 --> 01:54:24.723
What were you referring to?

01:54:24.758 --> 01:54:28.067
Uh...
Jack.
How was Europe?

01:54:28.102 --> 01:54:30.234
Great!
And good to be home.

01:54:30.269 --> 01:54:31.862
That's the attitude.

01:54:32.436 --> 01:54:33.864
Staying strong.

01:54:37.111 --> 01:54:39.012
Where have you been?
She's fine.

01:54:39.047 --> 01:54:42.147
And what do you think
of the new wave
of race films, Mr. Palmer?

01:54:42.182 --> 01:54:46.679
I find the studios' committees
for the casting of negroes
inspiring, don't you?

01:54:46.714 --> 01:54:50.056
And he replies,
"do they need an electrician?"

01:54:51.323 --> 01:54:52.993
Do you know any good jokes, Nellie?

01:54:53.028 --> 01:54:54.687
Yeah, I...

01:54:54.722 --> 01:54:57.327
Nell prefers listening to jokes
rather than telling them.

01:54:57.362 --> 01:54:59.263
Come on, tell us a joke.
I have a joke.

01:54:59.298 --> 01:55:01.100
Harold Lloyd and I were in France...

01:55:01.135 --> 01:55:02.893
Hey, how you holding up?

01:55:03.731 --> 01:55:05.368
You, too?

01:55:05.403 --> 01:55:08.173
Well, I guess the movie isn't a hit.

01:55:08.208 --> 01:55:09.669
So be it.

01:55:09.704 --> 01:55:11.979
I'm sure you'll get another chance.

01:55:13.477 --> 01:55:15.444
Why wouldn't I get another chance?

01:55:16.249 --> 01:55:18.051
No, it just... what I mean...

01:55:18.086 --> 01:55:21.813
Would someone kindly tell me
what the fuck is going on?

01:55:31.957 --> 01:55:33.891
He shows up with a mime.

01:55:33.926 --> 01:55:38.236
I go,
"Harold, my croque monsieur is
worth a lot more than a mime!"

01:55:40.108 --> 01:55:43.373
Nell, you must have
some good ones.
Well, i-i...

01:55:43.408 --> 01:55:45.672
I am not the best joke teller.

01:55:45.707 --> 01:55:48.147
Come on, Nellie.
Isn't being funny what you do?

01:55:48.182 --> 01:55:49.940
Yeah, I believe that films like yours

01:55:49.975 --> 01:55:52.811
are gentle
but virile olive branches
in these divided times.

01:55:52.846 --> 01:55:56.023
That is my cue.
I should be going.
Please, you must play for us.

01:55:58.687 --> 01:56:00.984
Come on, Nellie.
We'll approve your next picture.

01:56:01.019 --> 01:56:04.196
- Yes, Nellie, be funny.
- You know, I just thought of one.

01:56:04.231 --> 01:56:05.791
Two fish are on their honeymoon...

01:56:05.826 --> 01:56:07.496
Actually, I got one.

01:56:07.531 --> 01:56:10.235
A bear and a rabbit are
shittin' in the woods one day.

01:56:10.270 --> 01:56:12.336
And the bear says to the rabbit,

01:56:12.371 --> 01:56:15.273
"hey, do ya ever have a problem
with the shit
stickin' to your fur?"

01:56:15.308 --> 01:56:19.541
And the rabbit finishes shittin'
and he says,
"no, I never do. Why?"

01:56:19.576 --> 01:56:22.445
And the bear says,
"fan-fuckin'-tastic!"

01:56:22.480 --> 01:56:25.151
And he grabs the rabbit
behind the ears

01:56:25.186 --> 01:56:26.416
and...

01:56:30.653 --> 01:56:32.752
I can't believe you just...

01:56:32.787 --> 01:56:34.292
Why not?

01:56:34.327 --> 01:56:36.855
Why? Haven't you heard
what they say about me?

01:56:36.890 --> 01:56:39.022
I'm a degenerate fucking animal.

01:56:39.057 --> 01:56:41.167
"Oh, Nellie!" Look at them.

01:56:41.202 --> 01:56:45.765
"Who knows what she might do?
She's from Jersey, you know."

01:56:45.800 --> 01:56:49.175
This is what
a degenerate fucking animal
from Jersey does.

01:57:02.883 --> 01:57:07.325
That's what
the degenerate fuckin' animal
from Jersey does.

01:57:07.360 --> 01:57:08.986
So you know what?

01:57:09.021 --> 01:57:11.527
I'm gonna let you all go on
fucking your cousins,

01:57:11.562 --> 01:57:13.595
polishing your guest lists,

01:57:13.630 --> 01:57:16.829
plying your underaged
fuckin' mistresses
with fuckin' beaujolais,

01:57:16.864 --> 01:57:18.402
you sick fucks!

01:57:18.437 --> 01:57:20.767
I'm the animal?
What is this shit?

01:57:20.802 --> 01:57:22.439
What is this shit?

01:57:22.474 --> 01:57:25.343
I'm the sick one!
I'm the fuckin' crazy one!

01:57:25.378 --> 01:57:27.576
You people make me fucking sick!

01:57:28.282 --> 01:57:30.216
You're not better than me!

01:57:30.251 --> 01:57:33.648
You're not!
You're not fucking better
than me.

01:57:33.683 --> 01:57:35.914
I don't need this shit.

01:57:37.720 --> 01:57:41.051
You know what?
I'm gonna go home, I'm gonna
stick some coke up my pussy,

01:57:41.086 --> 01:57:44.758
and you all can stick
your champagne flutes

01:57:44.793 --> 01:57:48.025
up your Rose-smellin', candy-tastin',

01:57:48.060 --> 01:57:51.105
snow-white fuckin' assholes!

01:58:18.299 --> 01:58:19.760
My rug!

01:58:19.795 --> 01:58:21.597
You puked on my rug!

01:58:46.624 --> 01:58:50.054
<i>Please, before it's too late.</i>

01:58:50.089 --> 01:58:53.200
<i>You can't stay here.
They'll find you.</i>

01:58:54.027 --> 01:58:56.093
<i>They'll find us.</i>

01:58:56.128 --> 01:58:59.338
<i>Listen, Catherine.
I don't care if they find us.</i>

01:58:59.373 --> 01:59:02.671
<i>They could strip me of my rank</i>
<i>and it wouldn't change</i>
<i>how I feel.</i>

01:59:02.706 --> 01:59:05.245
<i>I've known loss.
I've known pain.</i>

01:59:06.974 --> 01:59:09.315
<i>It's you who gives me life.</i>

01:59:10.516 --> 01:59:11.845
<i>Catherine...</i>

01:59:14.146 --> 01:59:16.080
<i>I love you.</i>

01:59:16.115 --> 01:59:19.116
<i>I love you, I love you, I love you.</i>

01:59:27.060 --> 01:59:31.062
"I love you, I love you!"
"I love you!"

01:59:51.920 --> 01:59:53.458
Jack Conrad.

01:59:55.022 --> 01:59:57.891
What are your thoughts for the future?

01:59:59.598 --> 02:00:03.732
Well, my last two movies
didn't work,
but I learned a lot from 'em.

02:00:03.767 --> 02:00:06.229
There were things
I'd taken for granted...

02:00:06.264 --> 02:00:08.275
That maybe I shouldn't have.

02:00:10.169 --> 02:00:13.709
Well, you're still
mgm's biggest asset.

02:00:13.744 --> 02:00:15.876
You still command
the biggest paycheck.

02:00:15.911 --> 02:00:17.680
And I'd like to earn it.

02:00:17.715 --> 02:00:19.880
I'm still learning this new language.

02:00:21.015 --> 02:00:22.817
Is it true that you've quit drinking?

02:00:22.852 --> 02:00:24.918
Yeah.
It was getting in the way.

02:00:24.953 --> 02:00:27.426
I'm not gonna let that happen anymore.

02:00:27.461 --> 02:00:31.254
There's a lot of acting talent
coming in from the theater now.

02:00:31.289 --> 02:00:35.500
Might you go to the stage
to gain more experience?

02:00:35.535 --> 02:00:38.899
Elinor, I will master
the talking film on film.

02:00:40.903 --> 02:00:42.540
Do you miss the silents?

02:00:47.778 --> 02:00:48.778
No.

02:00:49.945 --> 02:00:52.110
We shouldn't stand
in the way of progress.

02:00:56.985 --> 02:00:59.282
Okay.
Thanks, Jack.

02:00:59.317 --> 02:01:02.395
You're still the kid
I met 20 years ago,
you know.

02:01:02.430 --> 02:01:06.124
You haven't changed...
A bit.

02:01:06.159 --> 02:01:08.401
Thank you, Elinor.
Neither have you.

02:01:30.821 --> 02:01:32.788
We're ready for you on set,
Mr. Palmer.

02:01:51.446 --> 02:01:53.611
She's not gonna
fuck this up again, is she?

02:01:53.646 --> 02:01:55.976
I guarantee you,
she's going to blow you away.

02:01:56.011 --> 02:01:58.616
- Is she ready? Hurry.
- I'll check.

02:01:58.651 --> 02:02:01.344
You good with the money?
Looks realistic.
Yeah. What about the gun?

02:02:01.379 --> 02:02:04.457
We're still having a problem
with the firing mechanism.

02:02:04.492 --> 02:02:06.756
<i>¡No, carajo!</i>
It still sounds like that?

02:02:06.791 --> 02:02:09.396
Hi there.
It's Jack calling for Irving.

02:02:10.190 --> 02:02:11.190
Jack Conrad.

02:02:12.731 --> 02:02:15.226
One o'clock. All right, fine.
I'll call back then. Thanks.

02:02:17.065 --> 02:02:18.504
There you are.

02:02:18.539 --> 02:02:20.968
We have a serious
fucking problem.
What?

02:02:21.003 --> 02:02:23.036
The band looks mixed.
What do you mean?

02:02:23.071 --> 02:02:26.303
I mean, the other players
are a lot darker than sid.
So?

02:02:26.338 --> 02:02:29.482
Manny, do you think
I could say a line?
No! Get back to the shot!

02:02:29.517 --> 02:02:31.649
In your wide, next to them,
Sidney looks white.

02:02:31.684 --> 02:02:34.113
But he's black.
They won't think that
in the south.

02:02:34.148 --> 02:02:36.566
To them, this'll look
like a mixed band. We won't
be able to book the movie there.

02:02:36.590 --> 02:02:38.326
The south is big money.
That's half the revenue lost.

02:02:38.350 --> 02:02:40.471
No, that's not possible.
Nellie needs this movie to work.

02:02:40.495 --> 02:02:43.221
Forget working,
it's not even worth
finishing at that rate.

02:02:43.256 --> 02:02:45.498
Wallach'll just pull the plug.

02:02:51.473 --> 02:02:53.770
What do you suggest?

02:02:53.805 --> 02:02:58.005
Oh, he did, did he?
Okay, then I'll call back
at 4:00. Thanks.

02:03:00.713 --> 02:03:02.240
Sidney?
Yeah.

02:03:06.917 --> 02:03:08.818
Why?
For the lighting.

02:03:08.853 --> 02:03:11.084
Just to match the other players.

02:03:18.896 --> 02:03:20.390
For the lighting.

02:03:22.097 --> 02:03:23.129
<i>Sí.</i>

02:03:25.298 --> 02:03:26.363
I know.

02:03:27.069 --> 02:03:28.574
But look around.

02:03:28.609 --> 02:03:31.368
Your fellow players,
if we don't get the shot,

02:03:31.403 --> 02:03:33.711
the studio will shut the picture down

02:03:34.615 --> 02:03:36.274
and they won't get paid.

02:03:37.145 --> 02:03:39.519
You're an actor now, Sidney.

02:03:39.554 --> 02:03:42.720
Actors change
their appearance
for roles.

02:03:42.755 --> 02:03:44.150
It's normal.

02:03:59.772 --> 02:04:01.970
It's going to be on you, Sidney.

02:04:02.005 --> 02:04:07.173
You are risking
all these guys' ability to
feed their families over makeup.

02:04:21.288 --> 02:04:22.793
<i>Gracias.</i>

02:04:31.804 --> 02:04:33.001
We all good?

02:05:03.737 --> 02:05:07.904
Left for the day. Huh.
Well, here's what I'm gonna do.

02:05:07.939 --> 02:05:10.467
I'm gonna come down there
and see for myself.

02:05:10.502 --> 02:05:13.679
No, that's exactly
what I'm gonna do.
Thank you.

02:05:17.883 --> 02:05:20.653
I'm sorry,
I just can't have you in here
right now.

02:05:20.688 --> 02:05:22.259
He left for the day,
but I can take a message
for you...

02:05:22.283 --> 02:05:23.283
Thank you.

02:06:43.430 --> 02:06:44.803
Cut!

02:06:44.838 --> 02:06:46.739
That is a wrap on sid.

02:06:51.372 --> 02:06:54.439
Uh, Mr. Torres?
We can't find miss laroy.

02:06:54.980 --> 02:06:56.309
Yeah?

02:06:56.344 --> 02:06:57.607
She's gone.

02:07:09.192 --> 02:07:10.862
Going over to stage 4!

02:07:13.493 --> 02:07:16.164
You'll need that
to come back.
It's okay. I won't be back.

02:07:17.805 --> 02:07:19.431
Madame? Let's chat.

02:07:19.466 --> 02:07:21.004
I'm on a deadline, darling.

02:07:21.039 --> 02:07:23.270
You know, when I first moved to la,

02:07:23.305 --> 02:07:25.536
you know what the signs
on all the doors read?

02:07:25.571 --> 02:07:28.143
"No actors or dogs allowed."

02:07:28.178 --> 02:07:30.409
Yeah, I changed that.

02:07:30.444 --> 02:07:33.445
I helped build this place
you call home.

02:07:33.480 --> 02:07:37.647
I've never had any illusions
about us. I've never pretended
we're friends.

02:07:38.155 --> 02:07:40.023
We're friendly.

02:07:40.058 --> 02:07:42.157
I scratch yours, you scratch mine.

02:07:43.028 --> 02:07:44.225
That's our work.

02:07:45.657 --> 02:07:47.228
But this?

02:07:47.263 --> 02:07:48.900
This is something else.

02:07:54.567 --> 02:07:57.304
What do you want, Jack?
I want to know
why you wrote it.

02:07:57.339 --> 02:07:59.669
No, you want to know why they laughed.

02:08:03.378 --> 02:08:05.015
Would you like me to tell you?

02:08:08.647 --> 02:08:10.416
Why they laughed.

02:08:13.058 --> 02:08:14.926
Sure, Elinor. Why?

02:08:15.522 --> 02:08:17.159
There is no why.

02:08:18.393 --> 02:08:21.933
It wasn't your voice.
It wasn't a conspiracy.

02:08:21.968 --> 02:08:24.430
And it certainly
wasn't anything I wrote.

02:08:25.972 --> 02:08:28.731
There's nothing
you could have done differently.

02:08:28.766 --> 02:08:30.876
There's nothing you can do.

02:08:30.911 --> 02:08:34.748
Your time has run out.
There is no why.
Stop questioning it.

02:08:40.184 --> 02:08:41.887
I'm on a dry spell.
No.

02:08:42.923 --> 02:08:44.285
It's over.

02:08:44.320 --> 02:08:46.925
It's been over for a while.
I'm sorry.

02:08:48.995 --> 02:08:51.556
Elinor, you peddle gossip.

02:08:53.296 --> 02:08:54.933
You don't make anything.

02:08:54.968 --> 02:08:57.661
You don't know what it is
to put yourself out there.

02:08:57.696 --> 02:08:59.465
You're just a cockroach.

02:09:00.875 --> 02:09:02.743
I've been counted out before.
This isn't new to me.

02:09:02.767 --> 02:09:05.845
Have you ever stopped
to think why,
when there's a house fire,

02:09:05.880 --> 02:09:08.243
the people die
and the cockroaches all survive?

02:09:08.278 --> 02:09:09.882
Jesus Christ.

02:09:09.917 --> 02:09:13.182
What happened was you thought
the house needed you.

02:09:14.086 --> 02:09:15.118
It doesn't.

02:09:16.550 --> 02:09:19.287
Doesn't need you any more
than it needs the roaches.

02:09:19.322 --> 02:09:21.553
And the roaches, knowing this,

02:09:21.588 --> 02:09:25.161
crawl back into the dark,
lay low, and make it through.

02:09:27.759 --> 02:09:29.330
See, but you,

02:09:29.365 --> 02:09:31.596
you held the spotlight.

02:09:33.633 --> 02:09:38.603
It's those of us in the dark,
the ones who just watch,
who survive.

02:09:43.478 --> 02:09:45.247
A house fire.

02:09:45.282 --> 02:09:48.349
And there'll be
hundreds more like it, too.

02:09:48.384 --> 02:09:51.220
An earthquake could
wipe this town off the map

02:09:51.255 --> 02:09:53.321
and wouldn't make a difference.

02:09:55.259 --> 02:09:57.391
It's the idea that sticks.

02:10:00.264 --> 02:10:03.199
There'll be a hundred more
Jack conrads.

02:10:04.037 --> 02:10:05.465
Hundred more me's.

02:10:05.500 --> 02:10:07.533
Hundred more conversations
just like this one,

02:10:07.568 --> 02:10:10.503
over and over again,
until god knows when.

02:10:14.916 --> 02:10:16.806
Because it's bigger than you.

02:10:25.388 --> 02:10:27.927
I know it hurts.

02:10:29.227 --> 02:10:31.557
No one asks to be left behind.

02:10:33.759 --> 02:10:37.134
But in a hundred years,
when you and I
are both long gone,

02:10:38.698 --> 02:10:42.975
any time someone
threads a frame of yours
through a sprocket,

02:10:44.110 --> 02:10:45.802
you will be alive again.

02:10:46.706 --> 02:10:48.211
You see what that means?

02:10:49.874 --> 02:10:53.843
One day, every person
on every film
shot this year will be dead.

02:10:53.878 --> 02:10:57.682
And one day, all those films
will be pulled from the vaults,

02:10:57.717 --> 02:11:00.685
and all their ghosts
will dine together,

02:11:00.720 --> 02:11:04.227
and adventure together,
go to the jungle,
to war together.

02:11:05.296 --> 02:11:09.001
A child born in 50 years

02:11:09.036 --> 02:11:11.564
will stumble across your image
flickering on a screen

02:11:11.599 --> 02:11:15.601
and feel he knows you,
like... like a friend,

02:11:15.636 --> 02:11:19.077
though you breathed your last
before he breathed his first.

02:11:21.576 --> 02:11:24.577
You've been given a gift.
Be grateful.

02:11:26.416 --> 02:11:28.020
Your time today is through,

02:11:29.353 --> 02:11:33.223
but you'll spend eternity
with angels and ghosts.

02:11:51.276 --> 02:11:52.770
Thank you for that.

02:12:26.311 --> 02:12:27.970
Manny!
I need your help.

02:12:28.005 --> 02:12:30.544
I'm in so much trouble
and I really need your help.

02:12:30.579 --> 02:12:32.876
Calm down and tell me what happened.

02:12:32.911 --> 02:12:35.417
I fucked up, Manny.
I fucked up, Manny.

02:12:35.452 --> 02:12:38.618
And I know you've
been trying to help me,
and I've kept fucking up.

02:12:38.653 --> 02:12:40.620
Now I really need your help,
and I hate to ask...

02:12:40.655 --> 02:12:42.094
Calm down.

02:12:42.129 --> 02:12:44.261
<i>Cálmate.</i>
okay, yeah,
I was in Cal-neva,

02:12:44.296 --> 02:12:47.165
and I was playing cards
and there was...

02:12:47.200 --> 02:12:50.795
This guy, McKay,
runs the place and, he's...
Like, you don't fuck with...

02:12:50.830 --> 02:12:52.170
How much?
He's...

02:12:57.672 --> 02:12:59.804
It's a lot. It's a lot.
How much do you owe?

02:13:02.974 --> 02:13:04.479
Eighty-five grand.

02:13:05.878 --> 02:13:07.680
They took me...
<i>¿como?</i> How?

02:13:07.715 --> 02:13:10.188
He took me back into a room,
Manny, and they said

02:13:10.223 --> 02:13:12.421
if I don't have the money
by the end of the week,

02:13:12.456 --> 02:13:15.160
they're gonna pour acid on my pussy.

02:13:15.195 --> 02:13:16.953
And they're not kidding.

02:13:16.988 --> 02:13:19.032
They will fucking kill you.
These people are killers.

02:13:19.056 --> 02:13:21.023
Pay them, okay?
I can't.

02:13:21.058 --> 02:13:23.432
You don't fuck
with these kind of people.
You just pay them.

02:13:25.535 --> 02:13:27.799
I can't pay them.
What do you mean?

02:13:27.834 --> 02:13:30.637
I don't have the money
to pay them. I don't have...

02:13:30.672 --> 02:13:33.178
You're Nellie laroy.
Of course you have the money.

02:13:33.213 --> 02:13:35.345
No, I don't. It's...

02:13:37.151 --> 02:13:40.042
It's gone.

02:13:40.077 --> 02:13:42.682
My dad's diner and the...

02:13:42.717 --> 02:13:45.355
We don't own the house.

02:13:45.390 --> 02:13:48.853
I don't have that...
I don't have that money.

02:14:09.942 --> 02:14:11.249
Fucking help!

02:14:11.284 --> 02:14:14.549
Please be nice to me, Manny.

02:14:16.113 --> 02:14:18.520
Please.

02:14:18.555 --> 02:14:20.324
You fucked my life!

02:14:20.359 --> 02:14:23.426
I have nowhere else to go.

02:14:23.461 --> 02:14:26.022
You're my only friend.

02:14:26.057 --> 02:14:28.629
You're the only one, Manny!

02:14:28.664 --> 02:14:30.763
You're the only one
who's ever been nice to me.

02:14:30.798 --> 02:14:34.140
You're the only one who's ever cared.

02:14:34.175 --> 02:14:37.770
I've always helped you,
and all you've done
is break my heart!

02:14:37.805 --> 02:14:39.376
Please.

02:14:41.776 --> 02:14:43.941
They're gonna kill me.

02:14:57.528 --> 02:14:59.462
I tried.

02:14:59.497 --> 02:15:02.729
Manny, I did everything you said.

02:15:02.764 --> 02:15:05.468
I tried.

02:15:12.774 --> 02:15:13.806
Don't go home.

02:15:15.744 --> 02:15:17.381
Stay here for a couple of days.

02:15:19.748 --> 02:15:20.879
I'm gonna fix it.

02:15:27.327 --> 02:15:28.425
Thank you.

02:15:32.794 --> 02:15:34.629
I'll fix it.

02:16:10.766 --> 02:16:13.239
<i>Jack! It's Irv.</i>

02:16:14.033 --> 02:16:16.132
<i>Jack?</i>

02:16:16.167 --> 02:16:19.135
<i>Listen, I've been trying you</i>
<i>for a while.</i>
<i>I got some great news.</i>

02:16:19.170 --> 02:16:21.973
<i>I got a job for you.
Prestige one.</i>

02:16:22.008 --> 02:16:25.350
<i>Lead got sick mid-shoot.
Quick start, quick wrap.</i>

02:16:25.385 --> 02:16:26.747
<i>Need you, Jack.</i>

02:16:28.179 --> 02:16:30.047
<i>Jack?</i>
Yeah.

02:16:30.082 --> 02:16:32.786
<i>Hear what I said?</i>
Yeah, I heard.

02:16:32.821 --> 02:16:35.921
<i>Okay? So?
What do you think?</i>

02:16:37.693 --> 02:16:40.563
Yeah. I just have
one question.

02:16:41.599 --> 02:16:43.269
It's a piece of shit, isn't it?

02:16:44.536 --> 02:16:45.996
<i>What?</i>

02:16:46.031 --> 02:16:48.031
And I'd be
bailing you out,
wouldn't I?

02:16:48.066 --> 02:16:49.934
<i>No. No. Of course not.</i>

02:16:49.969 --> 02:16:53.972
Irv, let's just call it
for what it is.
That's all I ask.

02:16:54.007 --> 02:16:57.008
I'll do your movie.
I'll bail you out.

02:16:57.043 --> 02:17:00.385
All I want in return
is a little honesty.

02:17:01.751 --> 02:17:03.112
Can you do that, Irv?

02:17:03.147 --> 02:17:06.049
Can you be honest with me
for ten seconds or so?

02:17:10.089 --> 02:17:12.155
I'd be bailing you out, wouldn't I?

02:17:14.467 --> 02:17:15.960
<i>Yeah, you'd be bailing me out.</i>

02:17:15.995 --> 02:17:17.930
And it's a piece of shit, isn't it?

02:17:20.736 --> 02:17:22.539
<i>Yeah, it's a piece of shit.</i>

02:17:28.139 --> 02:17:30.646
Okay, Irv.
I'll see you on set.

02:17:34.982 --> 02:17:36.146
Mr. Conrad?

02:17:43.495 --> 02:17:47.564
Harold, how you doing?
I'm doing good, Jack.
How about you?

02:17:47.599 --> 02:17:49.368
I'm doing okay.

02:17:51.228 --> 02:17:53.768
How many movies
have we done together now?

02:17:53.803 --> 02:17:55.440
This makes 82.

02:17:57.477 --> 02:18:00.412
Eighty-two.
That's right.

02:18:02.108 --> 02:18:03.811
Beautiful, isn't she?

02:18:03.846 --> 02:18:06.143
The great wide ocean.

02:18:06.178 --> 02:18:08.353
You remember your first time at sea?

02:18:10.248 --> 02:18:13.281
Kid, I'll never forget it.

02:18:14.626 --> 02:18:16.758
Cut! Fantastic!

02:18:16.793 --> 02:18:18.924
Not a dry eye in the house.

02:18:18.959 --> 02:18:20.959
Great. For this next take...
Yeah.

02:18:20.995 --> 02:18:24.094
I want to see more of
that real emotion.

02:18:24.129 --> 02:18:26.327
Okay.
You know?
Really dig into it.

02:18:26.362 --> 02:18:28.132
Yeah.
Find it out here.

02:18:29.299 --> 02:18:31.509
Find it on that horizon.
Yeah.

02:18:31.544 --> 02:18:33.643
A never-ending horizon

02:18:33.678 --> 02:18:36.745
that has brought you
all the way to this point.

02:18:36.780 --> 02:18:39.484
Brought you so far in life.
You know?

02:18:40.013 --> 02:18:41.111
Jack?

02:18:44.424 --> 02:18:46.523
You good to go again?
Sure.

02:18:53.995 --> 02:18:55.290
Nellie?
Manny!

02:18:55.325 --> 02:18:57.227
Manny, I got it all figured out.

02:18:57.262 --> 02:18:59.371
Because I know that
you've been trying to
get my career going.

02:18:59.396 --> 02:19:02.133
I've had an idea.
I was thinking I can dance.

02:19:02.168 --> 02:19:03.870
If I can dance, I bet I can sing.

02:19:03.906 --> 02:19:06.016
'Cause you can do anything
if you set your mind to it.

02:19:06.040 --> 02:19:08.513
Nellie, you have to
stop this, okay?
You really have to stop.

02:19:08.548 --> 02:19:09.921
I'm figuring out how to get the money.

02:19:09.945 --> 02:19:11.977
Exactly! This is how
we make the money back.

02:19:12.013 --> 02:19:13.825
I'm gonna tell wallach
that we're gonna
finish the movie, okay?

02:19:13.850 --> 02:19:16.180
And first, all this,
all this fucking mess

02:19:16.215 --> 02:19:18.391
that you are doing
every fucking day
is part of your process.

02:19:18.415 --> 02:19:21.184
Manny, it's gonna be like
nothing anyone's ever seen.

02:19:22.254 --> 02:19:23.990
Hello?
Manny, it's done.

02:19:24.025 --> 02:19:26.036
I got the money
and I know a guy
who will set the meet.

02:19:26.059 --> 02:19:28.698
You got it?
Okay, but... but you're going to
be there, right?

02:19:28.733 --> 02:19:32.228
Don't worry,
I'll be there the whole time.
See you Friday.

02:19:34.431 --> 02:19:36.540
Nellie, we did it, okay?

02:19:36.575 --> 02:19:39.202
Fuck Don wallach!
Fuck all of this shit, okay?

02:19:39.237 --> 02:19:41.546
Fuck him, Manny! Yes!
Fuck it! Fuck it!

02:19:47.554 --> 02:19:51.149
How did you
get the money so fast?
I have my ways. Don't worry.

02:19:51.184 --> 02:19:53.426
And it's all in here?
Yes.

02:19:54.660 --> 02:19:56.253
How do you know the guy?

02:19:56.288 --> 02:19:59.025
I sold him keys
a while back.
He works for McKay.

02:19:59.060 --> 02:20:02.765
So, we give him the bag,
he calls McKay, and the threat
against Nellie is off.

02:20:02.800 --> 02:20:04.096
Okay, okay.

02:20:05.737 --> 02:20:07.506
I'm not used to this kind of people.

02:20:07.541 --> 02:20:09.332
They're no worse than movie people.

02:20:11.006 --> 02:20:12.236
You good?

02:20:12.942 --> 02:20:14.876
Yeah, yeah. Let's go.

02:20:16.044 --> 02:20:19.012
Remember. A monologue
in the next picture.

02:20:26.054 --> 02:20:27.988
Wilson.
Been a while.

02:20:28.023 --> 02:20:30.254
Good to see you.
Meet Manny.

02:20:35.800 --> 02:20:37.426
Nice to meet you, Manny.

02:20:37.461 --> 02:20:39.637
And nice to meet you, sir.

02:20:39.672 --> 02:20:41.837
I believe this belongs to you.

02:20:49.847 --> 02:20:50.978
You're a producer?

02:20:51.684 --> 02:20:53.816
Um, a studio executive.

02:20:53.851 --> 02:20:56.753
Jim heard you were a big producer.

02:20:56.788 --> 02:20:59.822
He's here now.
He'd love to
buy you guys a drink.

02:21:01.485 --> 02:21:04.387
That's very kind of him,
but...
Sounds great. Yeah.

02:21:05.126 --> 02:21:06.499
Great. Follow me.

02:21:09.900 --> 02:21:12.329
Gotta be polite.
One drink.

02:21:13.497 --> 02:21:14.540
Fuck.

02:21:32.659 --> 02:21:33.691
Jim.

02:21:34.452 --> 02:21:36.694
This is Manny and the count.

02:21:38.192 --> 02:21:40.489
How do you boys do?

02:21:41.162 --> 02:21:42.491
I'm James McKay.

02:21:43.527 --> 02:21:45.131
How do you do, sir?
Hello.

02:21:45.639 --> 02:21:46.671
Sit down.

02:21:47.608 --> 02:21:48.608
Thank you.

02:21:52.569 --> 02:21:53.810
- Hey.
- Hi.

02:21:53.845 --> 02:21:55.405
Do you want a drink?

02:21:55.440 --> 02:21:57.341
It's Brandy mixed with ether.

02:21:57.376 --> 02:21:58.782
Yes.
Sure.

02:21:58.817 --> 02:22:00.817
Wilson, will you
get us some drinks, please?

02:22:03.250 --> 02:22:07.516
Sir, I... I just wanted to say
how sorry I am
that things got out of hand.

02:22:07.551 --> 02:22:09.727
Nonsense.
You came through.

02:22:09.762 --> 02:22:10.893
That's what counts.

02:22:13.161 --> 02:22:16.701
So, you boys are friends
with Nellie laroy?

02:22:16.736 --> 02:22:18.098
Um, yeah.

02:22:19.805 --> 02:22:22.234
Too bad what happened
to her career, huh?

02:22:22.269 --> 02:22:24.709
Such a shame, yeah.
It's sad.

02:22:24.744 --> 02:22:26.007
Her new movie will work.

02:22:27.109 --> 02:22:29.010
So you're the movie producer.

02:22:29.980 --> 02:22:31.716
Uh, studio executive.

02:22:31.751 --> 02:22:35.148
I got some movie ideas myself.
You wanna hear them?

02:22:37.086 --> 02:22:38.415
Yes.

02:22:39.121 --> 02:22:40.121
Please.

02:22:43.224 --> 02:22:45.125
Okay.

02:22:48.834 --> 02:22:51.934
Okay, so,

02:22:51.969 --> 02:22:56.202
there's a 10-year-old kid
and he's a prodigy
at all these adult things.

02:22:56.237 --> 02:22:58.402
He's supersmart with words.

02:22:58.437 --> 02:23:03.473
He can play the piano
and recite Lincoln
and all this stuff.

02:23:04.718 --> 02:23:06.344
Here's the twist:

02:23:07.413 --> 02:23:10.513
Turns out he's a 50-year-old midget.

02:23:10.548 --> 02:23:14.319
He only looks like he's a kid.
The joke's on us.

02:23:17.126 --> 02:23:19.588
That's really good. Wow.

02:23:19.623 --> 02:23:21.590
It's very good.
It's great, yeah.

02:23:21.625 --> 02:23:24.098
Very good.
I am sorry.

02:23:24.133 --> 02:23:26.903
I'm gonna check on the drinks.
I don't know where Wilson went.

02:23:32.537 --> 02:23:34.570
Stupid...

02:23:34.605 --> 02:23:36.979
One drink and we leave.
Right after this we leave.

02:23:37.014 --> 02:23:38.981
Calm down.
I am calm,<i> cabrón.</i>

02:23:39.016 --> 02:23:41.247
No, you're not.
You're very nervous.

02:23:41.282 --> 02:23:44.382
I'm not here for drinks
and fun, okay?
I'm in your debt.

02:23:44.417 --> 02:23:47.088
You're not in my debt.
Whose money it is?

02:23:47.123 --> 02:23:49.794
The guy makes it
by the kilo.
It's not a big deal.

02:23:49.829 --> 02:23:51.928
What guy?
You never told me
how you got it.

02:23:51.963 --> 02:23:54.656
Tony. The prop guy.

02:23:54.691 --> 02:23:56.999
I thought I told you that.
It's the prop guy's money?

02:23:57.034 --> 02:23:59.034
No, it's the money that he makes.

02:24:00.169 --> 02:24:02.499
What do you mean?
Like, uh, his income?

02:24:03.139 --> 02:24:04.941
No, it's his...

02:24:04.976 --> 02:24:08.472
It's from your
bank heist picture.
It's movie money.

02:24:08.507 --> 02:24:10.177
It's prop money.

02:24:14.821 --> 02:24:18.482
The money in the bag is prop money?

02:24:18.517 --> 02:24:22.024
Well, where was I
gonna get 85 grand
in two days?

02:24:22.059 --> 02:24:24.455
We have to go now, <i>pendejo cabrón!</i>

02:24:24.490 --> 02:24:25.797
Calm.

02:24:25.832 --> 02:24:28.657
Um, have I, uh, interrupted something?

02:24:28.692 --> 02:24:30.296
No, no.

02:24:30.331 --> 02:24:32.496
Oh, thank you.

02:24:36.370 --> 02:24:38.436
I got more ideas.

02:24:38.471 --> 02:24:40.603
You ever heard of Wyatt earp?

02:24:40.638 --> 02:24:43.177
He died a couple of years ago.
I met him once.

02:24:43.212 --> 02:24:44.849
Little known fact:

02:24:44.884 --> 02:24:49.513
The greatest hero
of the wild west
couldn't count.

02:24:49.548 --> 02:24:50.987
No?
No.

02:24:51.022 --> 02:24:53.022
So I was thinking,
you make a movie about him,

02:24:53.057 --> 02:24:56.025
and in it,
you make him
full-fledged retard.

02:24:56.060 --> 02:24:58.863
What?

02:25:00.031 --> 02:25:01.096
You okay?

02:25:02.396 --> 02:25:04.737
What?
You're sweating.

02:25:08.435 --> 02:25:10.534
It's probably the ether.
It's...

02:25:12.109 --> 02:25:14.307
I thought you were just
excited about the idea.

02:25:22.823 --> 02:25:24.680
My next idea's my best:

02:25:24.715 --> 02:25:27.089
The world's most fearless warrior.

02:25:27.124 --> 02:25:30.356
I know just the guy to play him.
You just build the movie
around him.

02:25:30.391 --> 02:25:32.094
He is sensational.

02:25:32.591 --> 02:25:33.722
He is?

02:25:36.100 --> 02:25:37.561
Would you like to meet him?

02:25:39.906 --> 02:25:42.269
Sure. Um, I...
I can have the studio set...

02:25:42.304 --> 02:25:45.470
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm going to see him now.
He's at the blockhouse.

02:25:47.309 --> 02:25:50.772
Where is that?
It's just over the hill.

02:25:50.807 --> 02:25:54.281
A few minutes' drive.
Wilson and I can
take you there and back.

02:25:54.316 --> 02:25:56.580
It's the best party in town.

02:26:00.586 --> 02:26:04.258
It's, uh... it's very late
and we have to go.
Oh, no, no, it's worth it.

02:26:04.293 --> 02:26:05.897
I promise you.

02:26:05.932 --> 02:26:09.868
I mean, I appreciate it,
but we have to go.
Trust me.

02:26:09.903 --> 02:26:12.068
You'll never forget it.

02:26:36.160 --> 02:26:38.820
Um, what's this?

02:26:38.855 --> 02:26:41.493
It's la's last real party.

02:26:41.528 --> 02:26:44.496
Wilson, bring that cash.

02:26:44.531 --> 02:26:46.498
This town has gotten so repressed.

02:26:46.533 --> 02:26:49.435
This is the only place left
where you can have
any fun these days.

02:26:52.473 --> 02:26:57.014
Welcome to the asshole of Los Angeles.

02:27:34.416 --> 02:27:37.153
He's two floors down!
Follow me!

02:27:53.864 --> 02:27:58.372
This city used to know
how to have a good time.
It's such a drag now.

02:27:58.413 --> 02:28:00.776
They still know
how to party here, though.

02:28:12.718 --> 02:28:14.421
One more floor.

02:28:18.525 --> 02:28:20.756
This is
the kind of thing
your industry needs.

02:28:22.563 --> 02:28:25.564
Hollywood has just
become so stale.
Don't you agree?

02:28:29.570 --> 02:28:32.802
Not this floor, either.

02:28:34.575 --> 02:28:37.543
- Wilson, isn't he on tonight?
- Thought he was.

02:28:38.249 --> 02:28:40.183
Sir?

02:28:40.218 --> 02:28:44.385
It... it's very late.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I promised you a sight.

02:28:44.420 --> 02:28:47.124
You're getting a sight.
Let's try one more floor.

02:28:58.929 --> 02:29:01.798
Bear with me, fellas.
Wait till you see this guy.

02:29:01.833 --> 02:29:04.570
I think we can make millions together!

02:29:19.422 --> 02:29:21.752
Oh, shit!

02:29:23.789 --> 02:29:25.657
That was so good!

02:29:25.692 --> 02:29:28.462
Oh, come on, boys,
it's just on the other side.

02:29:28.497 --> 02:29:30.035
It's worth it, I promise.

02:29:33.304 --> 02:29:34.633
Okay.

02:29:39.673 --> 02:29:43.015
Oh, yes. This is it.

02:29:44.942 --> 02:29:46.150
Yeah.

02:29:52.356 --> 02:29:54.686
Yes. I think I can hear him.

02:29:54.721 --> 02:29:55.786
Come on.

02:30:00.529 --> 02:30:01.693
Yes.

02:30:08.174 --> 02:30:11.637
I'm so excited for you.
You're gonna love him!

02:30:11.672 --> 02:30:15.113
Yes! Yes!
He's the next big thing!

02:30:20.747 --> 02:30:22.285
Incredible, isn't he?

02:30:22.320 --> 02:30:25.189
You either are a star
or you aren't.
And he is!

02:30:27.721 --> 02:30:30.689
Watch what he does.
It has to be seen
to be believed.

02:30:51.448 --> 02:30:53.349
Keep watching.

02:31:06.628 --> 02:31:10.630
Yes! Whoo!

02:31:10.665 --> 02:31:13.270
He's just made
for the movies, isn't he?

02:31:13.305 --> 02:31:15.272
They found him in a forest in Oregon.

02:31:15.307 --> 02:31:18.209
He will do anything for cash.

02:31:19.036 --> 02:31:21.036
Wilson, quick, give me a 20.

02:31:28.947 --> 02:31:32.289
More! Eat another rat!

02:31:32.324 --> 02:31:34.423
Give me another one.

02:31:50.001 --> 02:31:51.242
It's fake.

02:31:52.641 --> 02:31:53.739
No.

02:31:54.280 --> 02:31:55.939
No, come on.

02:31:55.974 --> 02:31:58.777
Let... let me explain...
We were gonna
make movies together.

02:31:58.812 --> 02:32:00.746
Let-let-let me explain.
Please.

02:32:00.781 --> 02:32:03.749
No, no, no, no, no!

02:32:03.784 --> 02:32:04.915
Hey, no, no, no, no!

02:32:17.633 --> 02:32:19.996
What the fuck?

02:32:22.308 --> 02:32:23.637
Back off! Back off!

02:33:09.080 --> 02:33:12.488
Oh, shit! Go! God!

02:33:19.189 --> 02:33:22.190
You have to see dresden.
It's the most beautiful city in Germany.

02:33:22.225 --> 02:33:24.665
- Jack said he was gonna take me to Greece.
- Greece?

02:33:24.700 --> 02:33:26.535
Isn't that right, honey?
That's right.

02:33:26.570 --> 02:33:28.702
The architecture is amazing.
You'll love it.

02:33:28.737 --> 02:33:30.935
- Santoríni.
- I hear it's so beautiful.

02:33:31.542 --> 02:33:33.410
Fay!
Jack.

02:33:35.612 --> 02:33:38.811
Folks, I'd like to introduce you
to the wild and wonderful
lady fay.

02:33:38.846 --> 02:33:40.813
This is Rebecca.
This is Lewis.

02:33:40.848 --> 02:33:42.485
- How do you do?
- Hello.

02:33:42.520 --> 02:33:44.080
- How do you do?
- What's your excuse?

02:33:44.115 --> 02:33:45.686
Just wandering through?

02:33:45.721 --> 02:33:48.326
Mmm. Something like that.
Let me get you a drink.

02:33:48.361 --> 02:33:50.394
Were you shooting?
No.

02:33:50.429 --> 02:33:52.253
Just wanted some air.

02:33:52.288 --> 02:33:53.727
What's next?

02:33:53.762 --> 02:33:56.092
I'm going to Europe,
actually.
Are you?

02:33:56.127 --> 02:33:57.632
Yeah, pathé wants me.

02:33:57.667 --> 02:34:01.372
That's great!
Pathé's got really good taste.

02:34:01.407 --> 02:34:02.439
Thank you.

02:34:02.474 --> 02:34:04.001
Jack's back!

02:34:04.509 --> 02:34:06.377
Way to go, Jack!

02:34:09.415 --> 02:34:11.745
So how's your movie?
It's shit.

02:34:13.419 --> 02:34:16.145
Another giant swing at mediocrity.

02:34:17.280 --> 02:34:19.753
Well, the girl seems nice.

02:34:21.460 --> 02:34:22.492
She is.

02:34:24.595 --> 02:34:28.124
And she has no idea
it'll end like all the others.

02:34:28.159 --> 02:34:29.994
You like her?

02:34:30.029 --> 02:34:31.094
No.

02:34:33.967 --> 02:34:35.637
You might want to save her.

02:34:45.616 --> 02:34:47.682
You okay, sweetie?

02:34:57.122 --> 02:34:59.958
It was the most magical place
in the world, wasn't it?

02:35:02.897 --> 02:35:03.929
It was.

02:35:03.964 --> 02:35:06.866
Another set, another review.

02:35:07.836 --> 02:35:10.166
Another romance, another breakup.

02:35:12.544 --> 02:35:14.302
I'm tired, fay.

02:35:24.182 --> 02:35:25.555
It's okay.

02:35:27.350 --> 02:35:30.791
It's okay. I've been the
luckiest bastard in the world.

02:35:33.323 --> 02:35:36.698
I had a good run, didn't I?
Hmm?
You sure did.

02:35:37.360 --> 02:35:39.063
Yeah. I enjoyed that.

02:35:41.034 --> 02:35:43.199
I gotta run, sweetie.
Yep.

02:35:43.234 --> 02:35:47.302
It was so good to see you, fay.
You're gonna do great things
in Europe.

02:35:47.337 --> 02:35:49.843
You were always
one of the good ones.
Thank you.

02:35:56.247 --> 02:35:58.313
Ciao, my love.
Ciao.

02:36:01.021 --> 02:36:03.692
- See you in venice.
- See you in Prague.

02:36:35.627 --> 02:36:37.726
I'm gonna go get those cigars.

02:36:46.704 --> 02:36:51.575
Hey, you do a great job.
What's the best tip
you've ever received?

02:36:51.610 --> 02:36:53.203
Fifty dollars.

02:36:53.238 --> 02:36:54.710
Who gave you that?

02:36:54.745 --> 02:36:56.745
You did, Mr. Conrad.

02:36:58.782 --> 02:37:02.146
It's on you now, kid.
The future's yours.

02:38:36.913 --> 02:38:39.474
They're looking for us.
Get up.
I don't feel good.

02:38:39.509 --> 02:38:41.619
We are going to Mexico,
Nellie.
Mexico?

02:38:41.654 --> 02:38:44.655
Get dressed. We are going now.
I'm not going to Mexico.
Are you crazy?

02:38:44.690 --> 02:38:46.316
They are going to
fucking kill us, okay?

02:38:46.351 --> 02:38:47.999
I fucked up.
Go hit a <i> piñata</i>
if you're homesick.

02:38:48.023 --> 02:38:50.694
Nellie, get dressed
and get in the fucking car, now!

02:38:50.729 --> 02:38:53.928
Manny, you're scaring me.
I need another hit.

02:38:54.898 --> 02:38:56.898
Okay, I feel better.

02:38:56.933 --> 02:38:58.669
Oh, hi. Do you have any coke?

02:38:58.704 --> 02:39:00.231
Yeah, I've actually got...

02:39:00.266 --> 02:39:01.881
Don't give her anything,
<i>pendejo.</i> Anything!

02:39:01.905 --> 02:39:03.498
Fine, I won't!

02:39:06.877 --> 02:39:08.569
Get everything you need.
We get gas.

02:39:08.604 --> 02:39:10.648
See you in ten minutes,<i> cabrón.</i>
Ten minutes.

02:39:10.683 --> 02:39:12.716
And some pills, please?

02:39:16.216 --> 02:39:17.886
Stop it.
Stop messing with the...

02:39:17.921 --> 02:39:20.449
Suck a dick, señor avocado.

02:39:20.484 --> 02:39:23.584
We need a fucking
gas station, now.
"We need a gas station, now."

02:39:23.619 --> 02:39:27.258
Yeah, we fucking need...
"Blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah."

02:39:27.293 --> 02:39:28.732
There!
There's gas.

02:39:28.767 --> 02:39:30.327
Fuck!<i> ¡puta madre!</i>

02:39:30.362 --> 02:39:33.297
It's closed.
I know it's closed!

02:39:33.332 --> 02:39:37.301
You know what we should do?
We should go dancing!
Manny! Oh, my...

02:39:38.205 --> 02:39:39.908
We could dance up here.

02:39:41.604 --> 02:39:44.077
Manny! Manny, come up here.

02:39:44.112 --> 02:39:46.948
Manny! Come on, it's fun.

02:39:46.983 --> 02:39:48.785
No, it's not fun.
Yes, it is.

02:39:48.820 --> 02:39:50.787
It's not fun.
We can have fun.

02:39:59.765 --> 02:40:00.995
Nellie?

02:40:01.866 --> 02:40:03.261
Nellie!

02:40:04.968 --> 02:40:07.705
Maybe they got dancing here!
Come on!

02:40:15.847 --> 02:40:17.539
Nellie.

02:40:17.574 --> 02:40:19.277
Nellie!

02:40:19.312 --> 02:40:20.949
Manny!

02:40:41.980 --> 02:40:44.442
Nellie, we have to leave now!

02:40:44.469 --> 02:40:46.281
We're going!

02:40:46.306 --> 02:40:48.746
I'm staying, Manny.
I'm not moving.
No, no, no, no.

02:40:48.781 --> 02:40:50.946
You know what happen if they find us.

02:40:50.981 --> 02:40:53.718
Why are you doing this,
<i>carajo?</i> Why?

02:40:55.046 --> 02:40:56.637
Tell me!

02:40:57.106 --> 02:40:59.525
Don't you know they're going to kill us?

02:41:01.069 --> 02:41:02.429
Wake up!

02:41:02.454 --> 02:41:04.190
Manny, I shouldn't...

02:41:04.225 --> 02:41:06.192
I shouldn't have asked you to help me.

02:41:06.227 --> 02:41:08.194
Let me help. I want to help.

02:41:08.229 --> 02:41:11.296
We can go to Mexico, Nellie.
And we can be happy.

02:41:11.331 --> 02:41:13.903
But we have to leave now.
Manny. Manny.

02:41:16.842 --> 02:41:19.942
It's the end of the road for me.
This is it for me.

02:41:19.977 --> 02:41:22.010
<i>Cállate.</i>

02:41:22.045 --> 02:41:23.143
It's not.

02:41:24.377 --> 02:41:26.311
I'm at peace with that.

02:41:28.348 --> 02:41:31.283
I'm not mad anymore.
Manny...

02:41:31.318 --> 02:41:34.550
Nellie,<i> cállate.</i>
You go to Mexico without me.

02:41:34.585 --> 02:41:38.686
What the fuck I'm gonna do
without you? I'm not going
anywhere without you!

02:41:42.868 --> 02:41:43.999
Manny...

02:41:44.034 --> 02:41:45.264
<i>Te amo.</i>

02:41:46.531 --> 02:41:48.003
<i>Te amo,</i> Nellie.

02:41:54.077 --> 02:41:55.780
What have I done?

02:41:56.849 --> 02:41:59.212
I don't think I'm good for you.

02:42:01.447 --> 02:42:03.546
I don't think I'm very good for you.

02:42:03.581 --> 02:42:05.416
Nellie, I want to marry you.

02:42:05.451 --> 02:42:07.891
I want to make you so happy every day.

02:42:07.926 --> 02:42:10.388
Okay, it's my only job.
From now on.

02:42:10.423 --> 02:42:12.060
But we have to leave now.

02:42:20.939 --> 02:42:22.367
Okay.

02:42:22.402 --> 02:42:24.875
I just want to be with you.
Okay.

02:42:26.076 --> 02:42:27.603
Okay, we'll...

02:42:28.243 --> 02:42:29.814
Okay, we'll...

02:42:29.849 --> 02:42:32.476
We'll go to Mexico.
We'll go...

02:42:32.511 --> 02:42:34.412
We'll go to the border
and we'll go down south

02:42:34.447 --> 02:42:37.921
and we'll get married
and we'll have kids and...

02:42:37.956 --> 02:42:39.582
It'll be you and me, okay?

02:42:43.896 --> 02:42:44.928
Okay.

02:42:46.195 --> 02:42:48.393
Okay.

02:42:48.428 --> 02:42:50.901
<i>Te amo,</i> Nellie.

02:42:50.936 --> 02:42:52.430
I love you, Manny.

02:42:59.945 --> 02:43:02.979
Hey, you two with the camera!
Do you know who I am?

02:43:03.014 --> 02:43:05.344
I'm Nellie laroy, bitches.

02:43:05.379 --> 02:43:09.414
Holy shit, that is Nellie laroy.
That's Nellie fucking laroy.
Come here.

02:43:09.449 --> 02:43:12.087
This is my husband-to-be,
Manny torres.

02:43:12.683 --> 02:43:14.353
Wait. Sorry?

02:43:14.388 --> 02:43:16.157
We're gonna get married.

02:43:16.929 --> 02:43:18.621
We're gonna get married?

02:43:18.656 --> 02:43:20.359
Are... are you really
gonna be her husband?

02:43:23.166 --> 02:43:24.792
Yes. Yeah.

02:43:24.827 --> 02:43:27.630
Congratulations!
Get a shot.
Get it, get it, get it.

02:43:58.938 --> 02:44:01.301
Do you need anything?

02:44:01.336 --> 02:44:03.600
You go grab him.
I'm good.

02:44:04.735 --> 02:44:06.339
<i>Te amo,</i> Nellie.

02:44:06.374 --> 02:44:08.176
I love you, Manny.

02:44:27.032 --> 02:44:28.856
Ain't life grand.

02:45:34.594 --> 02:45:36.858
I'm sorry.
It was hard to find gas.

02:45:36.893 --> 02:45:40.466
Yeah, well,
I got everything we need.
This is my roommate, Kyle.

02:45:41.172 --> 02:45:42.798
- Hey.
- Hi.

02:45:42.833 --> 02:45:44.712
You need anything?
I'm gonna fill this
real quick.

02:45:44.736 --> 02:45:46.934
No,<i> gracias.</i> Let's go.

02:46:10.025 --> 02:46:13.499
No. No, no, no, no.
No. No, no.

02:46:13.534 --> 02:46:14.632
Don't kill me.

02:46:21.212 --> 02:46:22.937
Please don't kill me.

02:46:22.972 --> 02:46:27.150
I'm nobody. I'm nobody.
<i>Que soy mexicano.</i>

02:46:27.185 --> 02:46:30.681
I can leave. Please, please.

02:46:33.389 --> 02:46:35.818
I'm sorry.

02:46:35.853 --> 02:46:37.127
I'm sorry.

02:46:40.891 --> 02:46:42.627
Get the fuck out of la.

02:46:46.501 --> 02:46:47.566
Disappear.

02:47:01.351 --> 02:47:02.647
Nellie. Nellie?

02:47:05.157 --> 02:47:06.255
Nellie?

02:47:07.192 --> 02:47:08.257
Nellie!

02:47:09.524 --> 02:47:12.019
Nellie! Nellie!

02:47:17.862 --> 02:47:19.730
Oh, fuck!

02:47:33.218 --> 02:47:35.845
<i>And introducing tonight,</i>

02:47:35.880 --> 02:47:39.079
<i>a new addition to the hart café band.</i>

02:47:39.114 --> 02:47:43.919
<i>Fresh from pictures,</i>
<i>Mr. Sidney Palmer</i>
<i>on the trumpet.</i>

02:47:52.061 --> 02:47:56.338
Hey, sid.
You want to say a few words?

02:47:56.373 --> 02:48:01.101
Thank you, Tom. Um,
I just would like to say to you
how happy I am to be here.

02:48:01.136 --> 02:48:03.246
You all are such
a beautiful, lovely crowd.

02:48:03.281 --> 02:48:05.105
So thank you.

02:48:05.140 --> 02:48:08.152
If I can, I'd like to, uh,
play something
that I used to play

02:48:08.821 --> 02:48:10.781
back in... back in the days.

02:48:11.784 --> 02:48:13.256
I hope you all enjoy it.

02:50:27.718 --> 02:50:29.084
This is it.

02:50:29.803 --> 02:50:30.934
What do you think?

02:50:31.505 --> 02:50:33.176
That's where I used to work.

02:50:35.400 --> 02:50:36.531
Passes, sir?

02:50:36.566 --> 02:50:38.126
We're just looking.
Thank you.

02:50:39.404 --> 02:50:41.063
<i>Hola.</i> hi.

02:50:41.673 --> 02:50:43.248
I used to work here.

02:50:44.484 --> 02:50:45.944
A long time ago.

02:50:46.804 --> 02:50:48.372
I started here last year.

02:50:48.397 --> 02:50:49.565
You like it?

02:50:50.125 --> 02:50:51.927
It's okay.
Yeah?

02:50:52.159 --> 02:50:53.744
They make anything good these days?

02:50:53.769 --> 02:50:55.730
- You don't go to the movies?
- Not much anymore.

02:50:55.755 --> 02:50:59.050
I own an audio shop in New York.
Radios, that kind of thing.

02:50:59.249 --> 02:51:00.334
New York?

02:51:01.877 --> 02:51:03.837
It's her first time in L.A.

02:51:03.921 --> 02:51:05.005
Oh yeah?

02:51:05.547 --> 02:51:06.924
Nice talking to you.

02:51:07.007 --> 02:51:08.300
You too.

02:51:08.982 --> 02:51:10.502
I'm bored.

02:51:11.862 --> 02:51:12.946
Really?

02:51:15.050 --> 02:51:16.475
So early?

02:51:16.633 --> 02:51:18.108
- Let's go.
- No, you stay.

02:51:18.133 --> 02:51:20.646
I'll take her to the hotel.

02:51:20.729 --> 02:51:22.064
We'll eat some ice cream.

02:51:34.151 --> 02:51:35.491
Adios.
Bye.

02:52:24.168 --> 02:52:25.233
Fifty cents.

02:52:29.811 --> 02:52:30.876
Thank you.

02:57:52.727 --> 02:57:54.265
<i>Tell me why.</i>

02:57:54.300 --> 02:57:56.531
<i>- Why?
- Yeah, tell me why.</i>

02:57:56.566 --> 02:57:58.973
<i>I don't know, uh, why.</i>

02:57:59.008 --> 02:58:01.536
<i>I just want to be part
of something bigger.</i>

02:58:01.571 --> 02:58:03.175
<i>To be part of something important,</i>

02:58:03.210 --> 02:58:04.913
<i>something that lasts,
that means something.</i>
