01:43.142 --> 01:44.575
Help me.

03:21.441 --> 03:23.375
And so, as the sun rose...

03:23.443 --> 03:26.606
over the island of Cheese...

03:26.679 --> 03:29.671
casting long shadows
through the sausage bushes...

03:29.749 --> 03:33.651
illuminating the tops
of the honey trees...

03:33.719 --> 03:37.382
and warming the fields
of smoked salmon...

03:37.457 --> 03:39.687
I, Baron Munchausen...

03:39.759 --> 03:44.059
who am renowned first and foremost
for telling the truth...

03:44.130 --> 03:47.964
the whole truth
and nothing but the truth.

03:50.169 --> 03:52.569
For while it has been
my privilege...

03:54.240 --> 03:57.403
- Tighter! Tighter!
- Hold steady!

03:57.477 --> 03:59.707
How can you become
a great actress like me...

03:59.779 --> 04:02.213
poor darling,
if you get blown to pieces?

04:02.281 --> 04:05.307
- Come on!
- Native land.

04:05.384 --> 04:06.976
Oh, yeah!

04:10.957 --> 04:13.892
There to attempt the education...

04:13.960 --> 04:16.690
of their provincial
and narrow-minded...

04:16.762 --> 04:20.562
and stupidly incredulous
fellow countrymen...

04:20.632 --> 04:23.193
we heaved anchor
and set sail.

04:31.711 --> 04:35.169
We heaved anchor
and set sail!

04:36.983 --> 04:39.144
The waves!

04:39.218 --> 04:42.745
- Oh, bugger!
- We heaved anchor.

04:42.822 --> 04:45.086
- We are actors!
- And set sail.

04:45.157 --> 04:46.988
Where the devil
are the stagehands?

04:47.059 --> 04:49.220
- Dead!
- They can't all have been killed!

04:49.295 --> 04:50.762
Not killed, ducky.
Suicide!

04:50.830 --> 04:53.264
Nothing to do
with your acting.

04:54.600 --> 04:56.932
We heaved anchor...

04:58.771 --> 05:00.966
But ill luck pursued me...

05:01.040 --> 05:03.975
and I was blown towards
the waiting jaws...

05:04.043 --> 05:07.774
of a whale of such prodigious size
and length...

05:07.847 --> 05:12.716
that I could not,
even with a telescope...

05:12.785 --> 05:14.719
see the end of him.

05:17.857 --> 05:21.088
What will become
of the baron

05:21.160 --> 05:24.493
Surely this time
there is no escape

05:24.564 --> 05:27.897
What will become
of the baron

05:27.967 --> 05:31.095
Surely this time there

05:31.170 --> 05:33.434
Is no escape

05:35.975 --> 05:38.307
I have learned
from experience...

05:38.377 --> 05:40.402
that a modicum of snuff...

05:40.479 --> 05:42.811
can be most efficacious.

06:03.135 --> 06:04.602
Hells bells...

06:04.670 --> 06:06.501
and buckets of blood!

06:06.572 --> 06:08.938
Where were the waves?

06:09.008 --> 06:12.603
The waves!
You've stabbed my vitals!

06:12.678 --> 06:16.273
- You incompetent imbecile!
- It wasn't me!

06:16.349 --> 06:18.146
It was her!

06:18.217 --> 06:22.119
It wasn't me!
It was him! You big pintle!

06:23.089 --> 06:25.683
We are supposed
to be professionals!

06:25.758 --> 06:29.717
And we're trying
to stay alive!

06:29.795 --> 06:31.854
- Sally!
- All right.

06:33.933 --> 06:37.767
Now stay in here
or I shall lock you up.

06:37.837 --> 06:39.668
- Where's my brother?
- What?

06:39.739 --> 06:41.639
You haven't got a brother.

06:41.707 --> 06:46.838
Then you just tell me why it says,
"Henry Salt and Son."

06:46.912 --> 06:49.779
- I'm your daughter.
- I shouldn't have taught you to read.

06:49.849 --> 06:53.876
"And Son" is traditional.
That's the way it's supposed to be.

07:11.170 --> 07:15.607
No. The sultan's demands
are still not sufficiently rational.

07:15.675 --> 07:19.304
The only lasting peace is one based
on reason and scientific principle.

07:19.378 --> 07:22.006
I'm terribly sorry,
Mr. Jackson.

07:22.081 --> 07:24.311
The first act didn't go
quite as we would have liked.

07:24.383 --> 07:26.874
One or two little
technical problems.

07:26.952 --> 07:30.911
Oh, please don't apologize, Mr. Salt.
I'm sure you're doing your best...

07:30.990 --> 07:33.049
in very trying circumstances.

07:34.794 --> 07:37.388
- Your attention.
- Hmm? Ah, excuse me.

07:39.732 --> 07:41.632
The officer
who risked his life...

07:41.701 --> 07:45.068
by single-handedly destroying
six enemy cannon...

07:45.137 --> 07:48.937
and rescuing ten of our men
held captive by the Turk.

07:49.008 --> 07:50.441
Yes, sir.

07:51.177 --> 07:55.113
- The officer we've heard so much about.
- I suppose so, sir.

07:55.181 --> 07:58.207
Always taking risks
far beyond the call of duty.

07:58.284 --> 08:00.218
I only did my best, sir.

08:01.220 --> 08:02.653
Have him executed at once.

08:02.722 --> 08:05.987
- Yes, sir.
- Come along.

08:06.058 --> 08:09.550
This sort of behavior is demoralizing
for ordinary soldiers and citizens...

08:09.628 --> 08:13.689
who are trying to lead normal,
simple, unexceptional lives.

08:13.766 --> 08:17.759
Things are difficult as it is without
emotional people rocking the boat.

08:42.227 --> 08:43.751
Constantinople.

08:44.463 --> 08:47.523
The court of the grand Turk.

08:47.600 --> 08:49.795
What a surprise...

08:49.869 --> 08:54.101
that a passing zephyr
should waft me here.

08:54.173 --> 08:55.697
Perhaps fate wishes me...

08:55.775 --> 08:59.108
to teach the sultan
a lesson or two.

09:03.415 --> 09:06.714
His highness the sultan
loved a good wine...

09:06.786 --> 09:10.244
and could never
resist a wager.

09:10.322 --> 09:13.553
Characteristics
that were to cost him dear.

09:13.626 --> 09:15.321
Lies!

09:15.394 --> 09:17.692
Those scoundrels!
I won't put up with it!

09:17.763 --> 09:19.492
It's intolerable!

09:19.565 --> 09:21.328
Stop this travesty!
Stop it!

09:22.768 --> 09:25.236
It's an insult!
An indignity!

09:25.304 --> 09:29.297
I've never seen so much rubbish
in all my life!

09:29.375 --> 09:31.969
You don't know
what you're talking about!

09:32.044 --> 09:34.342
One day,
after a sumptuous dinner...

09:34.413 --> 09:38.975
- Is this supposed to happen?
- The sultan bade me to accompany him...

09:39.051 --> 09:40.518
to his private apartments.

09:40.586 --> 09:43.384
Uh, please. No, don't.
Please.

09:43.455 --> 09:45.685
This blackguard's an impostor!

09:45.758 --> 09:49.489
I am the Baron Munchausen,
and I won't be made a fool of!

09:49.562 --> 09:51.655
- Please! You cannot come up here!
- No, no!

09:51.730 --> 09:56.190
- We are presenting a performance!
- You are presenting a mockery.

09:56.268 --> 10:00.068
You present me as if I were
ridiculous fiction. A joke!

10:00.139 --> 10:01.572
I won't have it!

10:07.980 --> 10:09.572
What the devil's going on?

10:20.092 --> 10:22.526
Curtains!

10:22.595 --> 10:24.426
Boo!

10:24.496 --> 10:25.963
Get him off!

10:27.566 --> 10:29.932
Old fool!
You're ruining the show!

10:30.002 --> 10:31.492
Quick! Jeremy, Bill,
do something!

10:31.570 --> 10:34.198
I must talk with my audience.

10:36.208 --> 10:38.506
Ladies and gentlemen, I must...

10:38.577 --> 10:42.445
I must apologize
for this most dreadful occurrence.

10:42.514 --> 10:43.947
I can assure you that...

10:50.422 --> 10:52.617
- Hello.
- Hello.

10:52.691 --> 10:54.659
Beautiful ladies.

10:57.830 --> 10:59.263
Hello.

10:59.331 --> 11:02.300
Beautiful ladies.

11:03.302 --> 11:06.430
You have really
great taste, sir.

11:06.505 --> 11:08.871
Otherwise,
it's all quite wrong!

11:08.941 --> 11:11.671
Listen, cocky.
We've got a show to do.

11:11.744 --> 11:14.645
Good lord! Berthold!

11:14.713 --> 11:16.806
Who's Berthold?

11:16.882 --> 11:20.682
How on earth?
It's marvelous to see you!

11:20.753 --> 11:23.586
How are you?
Where've you been?

11:23.656 --> 11:25.954
How are your legs?

11:26.025 --> 11:28.357
Where are the others?
Albrecht!

11:29.762 --> 11:33.129
Adolphus!
Gustavus!

11:33.198 --> 11:35.826
I can't believe it!
This is miraculous!

11:36.702 --> 11:39.671
- I'm Bill.
- He's Bill.

11:39.738 --> 11:42.468
Is he still here? Will you get rid
of him, for goodness sake!

11:44.109 --> 11:46.737
- What is the matter?
- I'm terribly sorry, sir.

11:46.812 --> 11:50.270
- We were about to start the second act.
- Who is this?

11:51.183 --> 11:52.946
I've no idea.
Some old lunatic.

11:53.018 --> 11:55.612
He's Baron Munchausen.

11:55.688 --> 11:57.656
Oh, I see.

11:57.723 --> 12:00.521
The real Baron Munchausen.

12:04.029 --> 12:08.762
Yes, indeed.
And who, sir, may I ask are you?

12:08.834 --> 12:10.597
A public servant.

12:10.669 --> 12:12.694
I am responsible for,
among other things...

12:12.771 --> 12:14.705
the licensing of this theatre.

12:15.407 --> 12:20.037
This, sir, is the Right Ordinary
Horatio Jackson who just happens...

12:20.112 --> 12:22.444
to be winning the war
and saving the city.

12:23.749 --> 12:25.910
Now please leave us!

12:25.985 --> 12:32.515
- He's an ass. Only I can end this war.
- Explain yourself.

12:32.591 --> 12:34.923
I can end it
because I began it.

12:35.661 --> 12:37.788
I am the cause.

12:37.863 --> 12:43.028
I'm afraid, sir, you have
rather a weak grasp of reality.

12:43.102 --> 12:48.039
Your reality, sir,
is lies and balderdash...

12:48.107 --> 12:52.601
and I'm delighted to say
that I have no grasp of it whatsoever!

13:00.652 --> 13:02.586
This man obviously
needs a doctor.

13:02.654 --> 13:04.952
A doctor?

13:06.692 --> 13:08.421
We will continue
with the show.

13:08.494 --> 13:11.930
Thank you very much,
Your Ordinaryness. Off!

13:11.997 --> 13:15.091
Please be reasonable.

13:15.167 --> 13:18.432
If we don't get on with it,
he'll throw us to the Turks

13:18.504 --> 13:21.166
I'll get on with it!

13:21.740 --> 13:23.537
Show them how it should be!

13:28.647 --> 13:30.080
My lords...

13:30.149 --> 13:32.674
ladies and gentlemen...

13:32.751 --> 13:35.777
Baron Munchausen,
at your service.

13:35.854 --> 13:37.822
Pruned any noses recently?

13:39.758 --> 13:42.454
- Give us a song!
- No. Please.

13:42.528 --> 13:46.396
Most of you won't remember me
or my adventures...

13:46.465 --> 13:49.332
but I assure you...

13:49.401 --> 13:51.801
they are true.

13:51.870 --> 13:53.303
The truth is...

13:53.372 --> 13:56.170
I am the cause of this siege.

13:56.241 --> 13:58.436
- Don't be stupid!
- What about the Turks then?

13:58.510 --> 14:01.172
You're the cause
of the border dispute, are you?

14:01.246 --> 14:03.373
What? It's the sea routes
we're fighting for!

14:03.449 --> 14:05.007
No, it isn't!

14:05.084 --> 14:07.143
That was last time!

14:07.219 --> 14:11.155
You poor deluded fools!

14:11.223 --> 14:13.589
If you'll only
do me the courtesy...

14:13.659 --> 14:16.753
of accepting the word
of a gentleman...

14:16.829 --> 14:20.230
I will reveal the true cause...

14:20.299 --> 14:22.233
of this war.

14:25.137 --> 14:26.570
After my...

14:27.372 --> 14:28.805
Oh, dear.

14:29.007 --> 14:32.033
After my return from Egypt...

14:32.111 --> 14:34.602
I was most warmly welcomed...

14:34.680 --> 14:37.376
by the grand Turk...

14:38.550 --> 14:40.882
his highness, the sultan...

14:40.953 --> 14:43.854
who knew of my reputation...

14:43.922 --> 14:47.050
and held me in high esteem.

14:48.227 --> 14:51.822
In fact, so delighted
was he with my company...

14:51.897 --> 14:54.957
that he offered me access
to his harem.

14:57.202 --> 14:58.794
- One day...
- Go on!

14:58.871 --> 15:03.308
The sultan brought me a bottle
of his favorite Tokay.

15:32.104 --> 15:34.038
What do you think of that, eh?

15:34.106 --> 15:36.040
Not bad.

15:36.108 --> 15:38.542
Not bad?
My dear Munchausen...

15:38.610 --> 15:40.578
it's impossible
to find better.

15:40.646 --> 15:43.547
Humbug, Your Majesty.

15:43.615 --> 15:45.742
What do you wager
that I won't procure...

15:45.817 --> 15:50.117
within the hour, a bottle of Tokay
far superior to this...

15:50.189 --> 15:53.124
from the imperial cellar
in Vienna...

15:53.192 --> 15:55.422
a mere thousand odd miles away?

15:56.094 --> 15:57.618
Accept my challenge.

15:57.696 --> 16:00.722
If I don't succeed,
you may cut off my head.

16:00.799 --> 16:03.359
These are my stakes.
What are yours?

16:03.435 --> 16:04.959
I accept.

16:05.037 --> 16:06.732
And if you succeed...

16:06.805 --> 16:11.765
you may take as much treasure
as the strongest man can carry.

16:11.843 --> 16:16.576
Agreed. Give me pen and ink, and I
will write to the empress immediately.

16:23.522 --> 16:25.080
Berthold!

16:28.860 --> 16:30.418
Coming!

16:30.495 --> 16:32.554
Oh, blast!
Sorry, chaps.

16:32.631 --> 16:34.394
I've got to go.

16:56.722 --> 16:59.987
Take this to Vienna,
to the empress.

17:00.058 --> 17:03.585
She will give you a bottle of wine.
Bring it straight to me.

17:03.662 --> 17:05.095
Right-o.

17:53.979 --> 17:57.415
Perhaps you would care for a little
light entertainment while you wait.

18:09.861 --> 18:12.352
I have been composing
a short opera.

18:12.431 --> 18:14.763
- Would you like to hear a song or two?
- No, thank you.

18:14.833 --> 18:17.563
Oh, you'll love it.
It's a comedy.

18:17.636 --> 18:19.570
It's called,
"The Torturer's Apprentice."

18:23.008 --> 18:24.600
Here's the overture.

18:45.731 --> 18:47.164
The curtain...

18:49.468 --> 18:53.234
The curtain rises on a typical
everyday torture chamber.

18:53.305 --> 18:57.241
Yosrick, the young apprentice,
sings of his joy in his job.

18:58.276 --> 19:04.306
A torturer's apprentice
went his merry way to work one day

19:04.383 --> 19:08.376
I bend and stretch and ply my trade

19:08.453 --> 19:10.318
Making people all afraid

19:10.389 --> 19:13.256
But things look black
Business is slack

19:13.325 --> 19:16.624
There's no one on the rack but me

19:19.898 --> 19:21.889
Act four
is set in an abattoir.

19:23.301 --> 19:25.428
I see a lot of slapstick.

19:25.504 --> 19:28.667
We begin with the arrival
of the eunuchs' chorus who sing...

19:28.740 --> 19:30.332
"Cut Off in My Prime."

19:35.547 --> 19:37.708
Cut off in my prime

19:37.783 --> 19:39.751
Surrounded

19:39.818 --> 19:44.152
By beautiful women
all the time

19:44.222 --> 19:47.783
A eunuch's life is hard

19:56.301 --> 20:01.762
And nothing else

20:01.840 --> 20:03.273
Excuse me a moment.

20:03.341 --> 20:05.571
Oh, you won't want
to miss this aria.

20:05.644 --> 20:08.442
It reminds me
of my school days in England.

20:16.154 --> 20:19.885
Life is rather like a game

20:19.958 --> 20:23.621
It's important that you win

20:24.396 --> 20:28.492
And though it seem
a terrible shame

20:28.567 --> 20:30.831
If you lie and cheat

20:30.902 --> 20:33.370
And sin

20:33.438 --> 20:34.905
Lay up and win

20:34.973 --> 20:36.873
The game

20:36.942 --> 20:38.375
Steady.

20:39.377 --> 20:41.311
Where the hell's Berthold?

20:41.379 --> 20:43.438
- Don't know.
- I though he was with you.

20:43.515 --> 20:45.107
Well, if he's not here
in three and a half minutes...

20:45.183 --> 20:47.344
the sultan
will cut off my head!

20:47.419 --> 20:50.718
- And?
- And?

20:50.789 --> 20:53.121
Is that all?

20:53.191 --> 20:55.352
I'm sorry,
I don't find that funny. Do you?

20:55.427 --> 20:58.863
This isn't a joke!
It's a wager!

20:58.930 --> 21:00.363
A wager!

21:02.400 --> 21:04.698
He's asleep.
I can hear him snoring.

21:04.769 --> 21:07.203
- About 900 miles away.
- Come on.

21:14.679 --> 21:17.409
He's under a tree!
Near Belgrade.

21:17.482 --> 21:20.576
- What?
- There's a bottle beside him.

21:20.652 --> 21:23.280
- Hope he hasn't been at it.
- So do I.

21:25.323 --> 21:27.723
What's the wind speed, Gus?

21:27.792 --> 21:29.225
Three knots.

22:00.825 --> 22:02.622
I'm a modern man

22:02.694 --> 22:05.993
These days I find
you have to be

22:06.064 --> 22:07.964
Awfully cruel to be kind

22:08.033 --> 22:10.433
I'm a modern man

22:10.502 --> 22:13.164
You will agree

22:13.238 --> 22:15.832
It's either you or me

22:17.742 --> 22:19.300
Well!

22:20.378 --> 22:23.074
Time's nearly up, I think.

22:36.928 --> 22:38.589
Ready.

22:50.308 --> 22:51.536
Now!

23:06.958 --> 23:08.949
- Not late, am I?
- No.

23:09.027 --> 23:11.222
Not late,
thank you very much.

23:13.932 --> 23:16.059
Thanks.
I needed a trim.

23:19.270 --> 23:22.205
- Much obliged.
- From the empress.

23:38.657 --> 23:41.023
Delicious!

23:41.092 --> 23:42.525
You win.

23:42.594 --> 23:46.052
Treasurer, allow my friend here
to take from the treasury...

23:46.131 --> 23:49.862
as much as the strongest man
can carry.

23:49.934 --> 23:51.663
Yes.

24:19.731 --> 24:21.164
That's it.

24:57.502 --> 24:58.935
Thanks, squire.

25:22.160 --> 25:24.094
I must speak
with the sultan.

25:25.063 --> 25:28.191
- What is it?
- Excellency! They've taken everything!

25:28.266 --> 25:29.961
What?

25:56.227 --> 25:57.660
Gustavus!

26:00.231 --> 26:01.789
Stop them!

26:13.311 --> 26:15.302
Bring them back!

26:15.380 --> 26:17.644
Gustavus! Again!

26:29.794 --> 26:31.261
Fire!

26:33.765 --> 26:35.824
Don't shoot!

26:37.335 --> 26:40.202
- Stand firm!
- Take cover, my friends.

26:44.309 --> 26:46.368
Regroup!

26:57.355 --> 26:59.152
Let me in!

27:01.492 --> 27:02.925
And so...

27:02.994 --> 27:06.794
as you can see,
the sultan is still after my head.

27:12.971 --> 27:15.804
Hey, wait!
Stop! Don't go!

27:15.874 --> 27:18.536
Come back!
There's more!

27:20.879 --> 27:23.439
I haven't finished!
Don't leave now!

27:32.824 --> 27:35.315
We're about to make off
with the sultan's treasure.

27:35.393 --> 27:37.258
You can't just stop.

27:38.696 --> 27:40.630
The name's Desmond, mate.

27:40.698 --> 27:45.032
We're actors, not figments
of your imagination! Now get a grip!

27:45.103 --> 27:48.766
Oh, come back!

27:54.979 --> 27:58.676
What the devil is the sultan playing at?
It's Wednesday, isn't it?

27:58.750 --> 28:02.550
I'm terribly sorry about the show.
One or two minor setbacks here, sir.

28:02.620 --> 28:05.851
This theatre's closed. I want you
and your company out of the city.

28:05.924 --> 28:07.983
Oh, no, sir! No!
No, sir. Please!

28:08.059 --> 28:12.325
Give us a say! Sir, look at these
favorable endorsements from Europe.

28:12.397 --> 28:16.527
"Mr. Salt's company holds a mirror
up to nature." "Vienna Clarion."

28:16.601 --> 28:18.865
"Great value for money."
"Paris Echo."

28:18.937 --> 28:22.270
"A good night out." "Glasgow Herald."
Just give us one second.

28:37.689 --> 28:40.419
Here, boy.
Good boy. It's all right.

28:44.929 --> 28:46.362
Here, boy!

30:13.718 --> 30:15.652
Are you all right?

30:24.462 --> 30:26.794
Am I dead?

30:26.864 --> 30:28.661
No.

30:29.400 --> 30:30.833
Blast!

30:31.803 --> 30:33.737
Who are you really?

30:35.339 --> 30:37.705
Baron Munchausen isn't real.

30:37.775 --> 30:42.405
- He's only in stories.
- Go away! I'm trying to die.

30:42.480 --> 30:43.970
Why?

30:44.048 --> 30:47.916
Because I'm tired
of the world.

30:49.220 --> 30:52.519
And the world
is evidently tired of me.

30:52.590 --> 30:55.491
But why? Why?

30:58.729 --> 31:04.031
Because it's all logic
and reason now.

31:04.102 --> 31:07.094
Science. Progress.

31:09.540 --> 31:11.974
Laws of hydraulics. Laws...

31:12.043 --> 31:14.807
of social dynamics.

31:14.879 --> 31:17.040
Laws of this, that...

31:17.115 --> 31:18.548
and the other.

31:19.450 --> 31:22.977
No place
for three-legged cyclops...

31:23.054 --> 31:26.023
in the South Seas.

31:26.090 --> 31:27.523
No place...

31:27.592 --> 31:30.857
for cucumber trees...

31:30.928 --> 31:34.022
and oceans of wine.

31:34.098 --> 31:36.225
No place for me.

31:36.300 --> 31:39.133
- What happened in the story?
- What?

31:39.203 --> 31:42.229
In the sultan's palace.
Did you escape?

31:42.306 --> 31:44.536
- Were you killed?
- I don't know.

31:44.609 --> 31:49.205
It was all a long time ago.
Who cares?

31:50.481 --> 31:52.005
I do.

31:53.551 --> 31:57.920
I'm very tired. Good-bye!

31:57.989 --> 32:00.924
- Please tell me.
- No.

32:00.992 --> 32:03.153
- Go on.
- Buzz off!

32:03.227 --> 32:05.195
Tell me!

32:08.966 --> 32:10.399
Please.

32:12.203 --> 32:17.004
You really want to know,
don't you?

32:20.011 --> 32:21.444
Stop it!

32:24.582 --> 32:27.244
We'll all be killed!

32:27.318 --> 32:29.752
And then I'll never know
the end of the story!

32:29.820 --> 32:32.414
Wait! Where are you going?
Come back!

32:35.560 --> 32:37.221
Stop it!

32:38.829 --> 32:40.763
Wait! Come back!

32:43.367 --> 32:45.801
Take cover!

32:50.007 --> 32:52.271
Wretched child!

33:11.696 --> 33:13.891
Get that powder under cover!

33:13.965 --> 33:15.398
Yes, sir!

33:26.644 --> 33:28.077
No!

33:29.981 --> 33:31.414
Stop it!

33:35.519 --> 33:36.952
Get away!

33:37.021 --> 33:38.682
Stop it!

33:38.756 --> 33:40.189
Head down!

33:41.692 --> 33:45.184
- No!
- You'll get us both killed.

33:45.263 --> 33:47.663
I thought you wanted to die.

33:47.732 --> 33:51.190
Yes, but I'm old enough.
Gentlemen!

33:52.536 --> 33:56.802
Don't you think it would be a good idea
to silence those enemy cannons?

33:58.576 --> 34:01.010
- No, sir.
- No?

34:01.746 --> 34:03.680
It's Wednesday.

34:03.748 --> 34:07.047
Oh, my... Wednesday!

34:29.639 --> 34:31.197
Oh, no!

35:36.640 --> 35:39.473
The Turks are about
to storm the walls.

35:40.277 --> 35:43.144
You really are Baron Munchausen.

35:57.828 --> 36:02.128
That's it. The end.
It's all over.

36:02.199 --> 36:06.636
Generations of theatrical expertise
snuffed out...

36:06.704 --> 36:09.070
in the twinkling of an eye.

36:10.741 --> 36:12.231
Sally?

36:14.812 --> 36:16.245
Get off!

36:18.449 --> 36:20.178
Come here.

36:20.251 --> 36:23.584
You cretinous, senile
old fart!

36:26.056 --> 36:29.355
Thanks to you,
we're to be thrown to the Turks!

36:29.427 --> 36:32.294
But he is Baron Munchausen!

36:32.363 --> 36:34.297
The real one!

36:34.365 --> 36:37.664
- You must believe me!
- Hurry!

36:37.735 --> 36:40.602
No, honestly! He is!

36:41.672 --> 36:44.539
- Shut up!
- But he is!

36:44.608 --> 36:46.769
And he can save us!

36:46.844 --> 36:49.108
Can't you?

36:49.180 --> 36:52.775
He jumped onto a cannonball.

36:52.850 --> 36:56.251
He really did!
And he flew miles up into the sky!

36:56.320 --> 36:59.915
- Above the elephants and soldiers...
- God! Stop lying!

36:59.990 --> 37:03.323
I'm not lying! Am I?

37:04.295 --> 37:05.728
As a matter of fact, you are.

37:07.064 --> 37:08.497
But he did.

37:09.533 --> 37:11.626
And those soldiers saw him too!

37:12.503 --> 37:14.698
They'll tell you!

37:14.772 --> 37:17.297
Oh, they're dead.

37:18.742 --> 37:22.143
- But he did!
- No, I didn't.

37:22.213 --> 37:24.044
Now you're lying!

37:25.483 --> 37:27.713
I never lie!

37:35.125 --> 37:37.355
Stay here!
What's got into you?

37:41.265 --> 37:44.132
I didn't fly miles.

37:45.469 --> 37:47.403
It was more like
a mile and a half.

37:48.472 --> 37:50.736
And I didn't precisely fly.

37:50.808 --> 37:55.575
I merely held on to a mortar shell
in the first instance...

37:55.646 --> 37:58.376
and then a cannonball
on the way back.

37:58.449 --> 38:02.579
You maniac!
You've done for us!

38:02.653 --> 38:05.713
Actually, it doesn't matter
whether you're thrown out or stay here.

38:05.789 --> 38:08.383
The Turks
are about to take the town.

38:08.459 --> 38:10.518
Quickly!
Bring those guns out!

38:14.098 --> 38:16.794
I'm just coming
into my prime!

38:16.867 --> 38:20.803
I'm just on the cusp
between Romeo and King Lear.

38:20.871 --> 38:24.967
My public will kill me
for dying at a time like this.

38:25.809 --> 38:27.743
- Save us!
- Yes.

38:28.612 --> 38:30.045
Save us!

38:31.382 --> 38:35.716
- Don't disappoint me!
- Please, Baron. Please.

38:35.786 --> 38:40.120
- You are a baron, aren't you?
- You're our only hope!

38:40.190 --> 38:42.556
You are my only hope.

38:42.626 --> 38:45.060
Ladies! Please!

38:48.365 --> 38:50.492
I swear that as long as I...

38:50.568 --> 38:55.403
Heronomous Carl Frederick,
Baron von Munchausen live and breathe...

38:55.472 --> 38:58.635
you shall come to no harm.

38:58.709 --> 39:02.645
You so remind me
of Catherine the Great...

39:02.713 --> 39:05.341
empress of all the Russia's...

39:05.416 --> 39:08.817
whose hand in marriage
I once had the honor to decline.

39:08.886 --> 39:10.581
They all remind you?

39:11.689 --> 39:13.850
Yes, why not?

39:13.924 --> 39:17.826
Some bits here, some bits there.
I have a plan!

39:18.562 --> 39:20.427
I will set forth immediately...

39:25.069 --> 39:28.470
find my extraordinary servants...

39:30.040 --> 39:34.943
with their help,
raze the siege and save the town.

39:35.012 --> 39:37.003
Oh, brilliant.
Oh, very good. Bravo!

39:37.081 --> 39:41.609
- How?
- Ladies, I'll require your assistance.

39:41.685 --> 39:43.118
Of course.

39:43.187 --> 39:46.315
- Anything!
- Just tell us what to do.

39:47.224 --> 39:51.524
Kindly be so good
as to remove your knickers.

40:23.127 --> 40:25.061
Yes, well done there.

40:26.063 --> 40:28.122
Look at all that underwear.

40:28.198 --> 40:32.601
Isn't it beautiful?
It's like a dream come true.

40:33.404 --> 40:36.134
It's the dawning of the age...

40:36.206 --> 40:39.141
of lovely, intimate things.

40:39.209 --> 40:42.610
But it's madness.
He'll kill himself.

40:42.680 --> 40:45.649
- Yeah, but well worth it, eh?
- What are you doing?

40:45.716 --> 40:48.150
Enough nattering.
Keep pumping!

41:03.901 --> 41:06.096
Hey.
Better report this.

41:06.170 --> 41:07.637
You're right.

41:23.654 --> 41:27.385
We need a very simple plan.
These are far too complicated.

41:27.458 --> 41:30.427
- Simplicity is of the essence.
- Sir.

41:30.494 --> 41:32.724
Those actors
have made an air balloon.

41:32.796 --> 41:34.491
They're trying to escape.

41:35.799 --> 41:38.290
Arrest them at once.

41:38.368 --> 41:40.302
Thrown them
out of the town.

41:40.370 --> 41:42.895
We can't open the gates, sir.

41:44.074 --> 41:46.634
Well, throw them
over the walls, then.

41:46.710 --> 41:48.644
Yes, sir.

41:49.813 --> 41:52.179
We can't start escaping
at a time like this.

41:52.249 --> 41:54.911
What would future generations
think of us?

42:02.960 --> 42:04.894
Right.
Follow me!

42:28.385 --> 42:31.320
Just hold it!
Don't let it go!

42:34.191 --> 42:36.318
Hold it, Adolphus!

42:36.393 --> 42:38.122
Bring it down.

42:38.195 --> 42:40.891
Yes.
Bring the ladder over here.

42:42.633 --> 42:44.567
Take care!

42:47.571 --> 42:49.505
Baron!

42:51.842 --> 42:55.437
- Oi! Have you seen Sally?
- No!

42:56.713 --> 42:59.739
- Oh, thank you, my dear.
- Stop!

43:00.450 --> 43:03.078
- You're under arrest!
- Let go!

43:06.256 --> 43:08.053
Quickly!

43:09.760 --> 43:11.990
Quickly! Let go!

43:14.331 --> 43:16.595
Take aim!

43:16.667 --> 43:18.100
Fire!

43:22.940 --> 43:25.238
Ladies and gentlemen...

43:25.309 --> 43:28.904
I shall shortly return
with reinforcements.

43:28.979 --> 43:30.606
Don't lose heart.

43:30.681 --> 43:32.581
And for all those ladies...

43:32.649 --> 43:35.413
to whom I am indebted
for half a ton...

43:35.485 --> 43:38.318
of frilly silk
and lacey linen:

43:38.388 --> 43:41.448
Don't catch cold!
Au revoir.

43:43.026 --> 43:45.859
Stay, Argus!
I'll soon be back.

43:46.430 --> 43:49.058
I will wait for you!

43:51.501 --> 43:52.934
Come back soon!

44:02.913 --> 44:05.541
He won't get far
on hot air and fantasy.

44:19.663 --> 44:21.426
Blast!

44:23.901 --> 44:25.334
Hang on!

44:26.904 --> 44:28.337
Keep...

44:38.715 --> 44:42.173
- Thanks.
- Now you've ruined everything!

44:42.252 --> 44:45.119
I'll have to douse the fire
to let you down.

44:46.123 --> 44:49.456
- I'll never get off again!
- I'm going with you.

44:49.526 --> 44:53.519
I absolutely utterly refuse!

44:53.597 --> 44:56.623
If we go down now,
we'll land on the Turks.

45:58.095 --> 46:00.393
We've got to find
your servants...

46:00.464 --> 46:02.398
and get back here quickly.

46:02.466 --> 46:04.900
That is what I had in mind.

46:36.433 --> 46:39.596
- Where are we going?
- To the moon.

46:39.669 --> 46:42.900
What? That'll take ages!

46:42.973 --> 46:46.409
- No, it won't.
- Of course it will.

46:47.244 --> 46:52.238
- Why are we going there?
- That's where I last saw Berthold.

46:52.315 --> 46:54.749
Have you ever been
to the moon?

46:54.818 --> 46:58.845
- No.
- Ah! Interesting place.

46:58.922 --> 47:01.982
The king and queen
are charming.

47:02.059 --> 47:04.994
You know
about their detachable heads...

47:05.062 --> 47:06.495
don't you?

47:06.563 --> 47:08.428
No.

47:08.498 --> 47:11.626
Their heads go off
for intellectual pursuits...

47:11.701 --> 47:15.000
while their bodies engage
in more...

47:15.072 --> 47:16.937
bodily activities.

47:17.507 --> 47:22.171
The trouble is their heads and bodies
don't always see eye to eye.

47:26.583 --> 47:29.017
You do believe me,
don't you?

47:30.387 --> 47:32.651
I'm doing my best.

47:48.738 --> 47:50.467
Are you scared?

47:51.942 --> 47:53.876
Certainly not!

47:57.013 --> 47:58.810
- You?
- Certainly not!

48:22.873 --> 48:24.500
Grab the rope!

49:39.649 --> 49:41.913
We're here!

49:43.386 --> 49:46.913
You look different.
Younger.

49:46.990 --> 49:50.824
I always feel rejuvenated
by a touch of adventure.

49:50.894 --> 49:55.661
Heaven's sake. Don't you get any younger
or I'll have to find a wet nurse.

49:56.733 --> 49:58.166
Look!

50:07.344 --> 50:10.677
You'll find that I'm one
of the king's special favorites.

50:12.315 --> 50:14.681
We shall receive
a right royal welcome.

50:54.724 --> 50:56.157
Now what?

50:59.229 --> 51:01.322
I got you at last.

51:04.434 --> 51:08.962
Your Majesty, what a great pleasure
it is to see you again.

51:09.039 --> 51:11.667
May I introduce
my friend Sally?

51:11.741 --> 51:16.508
Sally, King of the Moon.
Well, his head at any rate.

51:16.579 --> 51:19.514
I'm sorry, you must refer to me
by my complete title...

51:19.582 --> 51:21.015
King of Everything...

51:21.084 --> 51:23.450
Re di Tutto,
but you may call me "Ray."

51:23.520 --> 51:27.047
The moon is a very insignificant
part of my domain now.

51:27.123 --> 51:30.058
There is so much, much more.

51:32.128 --> 51:35.359
My old friend, you seem to be
in some discomfort.

51:35.432 --> 51:37.024
What ails you?

51:37.100 --> 51:42.163
Nothing ails me. Can you not see
that I am at one with the cosmos?

51:45.442 --> 51:47.569
I tell you that,
and all you can say is, "ah"?

51:47.644 --> 51:49.942
What are you blind?

51:50.013 --> 51:52.208
Baron, let me explain it to you.

51:52.282 --> 51:56.685
Since you were last here, I, that is
my head, that which is left of me...

51:56.753 --> 51:58.983
where the brilliant
and important parts are located...

51:59.055 --> 52:02.320
is now ruling and governing
the known universe.

52:02.392 --> 52:05.327
And that which I don't know,
I create.

52:08.498 --> 52:10.432
I just created spring.

52:10.500 --> 52:15.267
But seriously, without me,
there would be nothing. Not even you.

52:16.840 --> 52:19.035
I think, therefore you is.

52:21.411 --> 52:23.777
Your old friend's a lunatic.

52:23.847 --> 52:25.815
So it would seem.

52:25.882 --> 52:29.215
Certainly fallen prey
to delusions of grandeur.

52:29.285 --> 52:33.016
Being in tune with every molecule
in the universe...

52:33.089 --> 52:36.081
requires a great deal
of concentration.

52:36.159 --> 52:39.424
That is why having you on the loose,
Baron, does not help.

52:39.496 --> 52:43.227
You see, your little stories
are somewhat of a distraction to me.

52:43.299 --> 52:46.462
You are like a mosquito
in the Taj Mahal.

52:48.037 --> 52:53.100
I must inform you, My Liege, without
my adventures, you wouldn't be here.

52:53.176 --> 52:57.476
Well, so I am now part
of your adventures.

52:58.314 --> 53:00.646
Well, we shall see
about that, huh?

53:18.535 --> 53:21.129
Now, Baron.
Who created who?

53:21.204 --> 53:24.173
I hope you'll be
very comfortable. Ciao.

53:24.240 --> 53:26.708
There goes my revolting body
with the queen.

53:27.677 --> 53:31.443
Oh, stop it!
Oh, I'm tired!

53:31.514 --> 53:34.381
- I'm exhausted!
- Go away! Damn it. He can't hear me.

53:34.451 --> 53:38.285
Please, oh!
Oh, you stinking horrible man!

53:38.354 --> 53:40.618
Oh, it's so embarrassing.

53:40.690 --> 53:44.285
Please don't look.
Maybe he will go away.

53:44.360 --> 53:46.954
It is hard to believe
my body and I were ever attached.

53:47.030 --> 53:48.463
We are totally incompatible.

53:48.531 --> 53:51.796
He is dangling from the food chain,
and I am in the stars.

53:51.868 --> 53:55.326
It is so unmetaphysical.
No! No, go away!

53:56.573 --> 53:59.201
I despise you!
Let me go!

54:11.354 --> 54:12.787
I'm back!

54:12.856 --> 54:16.815
I got lips again,
and I'm going to use them, baby!

54:17.894 --> 54:20.920
It's me!
I'm your elephant of joy!

54:24.834 --> 54:28.861
- Give me bacio, baby!
- Yes, but eat first, darling!

54:30.206 --> 54:34.302
That's right.
You've got to mangia before bacio!

54:39.716 --> 54:42.810
You can't do that
when you don't got no mouth!

54:42.886 --> 54:44.751
Baron!

54:44.821 --> 54:46.755
I'm back in business.

54:47.891 --> 54:49.324
Oh, yeah.

54:50.226 --> 54:51.818
You don't go nowhere.

54:58.034 --> 55:02.562
- Baron.
- Oh, most wondrous Majesty.

55:02.639 --> 55:04.072
Hey, I know you.

55:04.140 --> 55:08.270
You're the little guy tried to make off
with my queen the last time.

55:08.344 --> 55:09.606
- Huh?
- Moi?

55:09.679 --> 55:13.274
We have no more of that,
piccolo Casanova.

55:14.350 --> 55:16.284
What are you looking at?

55:22.292 --> 55:23.987
There you go, lovebirds.

55:24.060 --> 55:26.585
I'm sure you'll be
very uncomfortable.

55:39.409 --> 55:42.572
I am free again.
Free to concentrate on higher things.

55:47.684 --> 55:50.812
Why don't you go back
and amuse yourself with this slime?

55:50.887 --> 55:52.479
Oh, you missed me!

55:52.555 --> 55:55.991
I'm blind! Wait! My kingdom
for a handkerchief! Wait!

55:57.527 --> 56:01.657
Let me go! I've got tides to regulate!
Comets to direct!

56:01.731 --> 56:03.790
I don't have time
for flatulence and orgasms!

56:03.866 --> 56:05.800
I hate that face
you make me make. That...

56:05.868 --> 56:09.304
Please. Please, no!
I don't want any more bodily functions!

56:10.607 --> 56:13.201
Oh, no.
Please let me go!

56:13.276 --> 56:16.211
- I don't have time for this!
- Farewell, Baron.

56:28.791 --> 56:30.349
One of the king's favorites?

56:31.561 --> 56:34.291
This cage isn't real.

56:34.364 --> 56:37.333
It's just part
of the king's lunacy.

56:37.400 --> 56:40.392
It seems solid enough to me.

56:40.470 --> 56:43.439
I see we're not in a very helpful
frame of mind.

56:43.506 --> 56:46.532
How are we supposed
to save the town from here?

56:46.609 --> 56:49.737
The town is perfectly all right.

56:49.812 --> 56:52.474
The peasant assault is over.
Everyone is quite safe.

56:52.548 --> 56:54.413
How do you know?

56:55.685 --> 56:57.653
I just know.

57:07.397 --> 57:08.830
What the devil?

57:08.898 --> 57:11.025
All right. I'm coming.

57:12.068 --> 57:13.501
My hand!

57:15.071 --> 57:17.301
Come out.
Come out of there.

57:22.945 --> 57:25.880
- Come out of there!
- Ow! Stop that!

57:26.683 --> 57:30.175
- What did you do that for?
- I thought you might be unfriendly.

57:30.253 --> 57:32.778
Of course I'm unfriendly.

57:32.855 --> 57:36.291
- You'd be unfriendly if I prodded you.
- Who are you?

57:39.362 --> 57:40.795
I can't remember.

57:40.863 --> 57:43.354
- I've been here so long.
- We'll be like that...

57:43.433 --> 57:45.458
if we don't escape.

57:45.535 --> 57:47.230
Why are you here?

57:47.303 --> 57:49.635
Oh, I'm a very wicked criminal.

57:50.606 --> 57:54.440
- What have you done?
- I can't remember.

57:54.510 --> 57:56.307
How do you know you're wicked?

57:57.346 --> 57:59.940
Well, for one thing...

58:00.016 --> 58:01.881
I'm in here.

58:01.951 --> 58:04.317
And for another...

58:05.722 --> 58:07.713
I've got these shackles on.

58:07.790 --> 58:10.588
- Berthold!
- Eh?

58:10.660 --> 58:12.321
It's Berthold!

58:15.031 --> 58:17.761
It's me! The baron!

58:17.834 --> 58:20.064
I knew I'd find you
on the moon.

58:20.136 --> 58:22.900
I'm going to take you back to Earth
to help us fight the sultan!

58:22.972 --> 58:24.940
Get off me!

58:25.007 --> 58:27.908
You're Berthold!
My old servant.

58:27.977 --> 58:32.607
Those leg irons are to slow you down.
Stop you tearing off all over the place.

58:32.682 --> 58:36.311
- You must be joking.
- You always wore them. Remember?

58:36.385 --> 58:39.286
- You're crackers!
- I'm Baron Munchausen.

58:39.355 --> 58:42.518
Hmm. That sounds nasty.
Is it contagious?

58:42.592 --> 58:46.028
We're wasting time!

58:52.769 --> 58:55.033
Darling Baron!

58:55.104 --> 58:57.504
Ariadne.

58:58.341 --> 59:01.742
I'm sorry I couldn't
speak with you before...

59:01.811 --> 59:05.713
but Roger's so difficult.

59:05.782 --> 59:09.377
Where exactly is Roger?

59:09.452 --> 59:11.852
In bed with my body, of course.

59:14.056 --> 59:17.423
Stop it!

59:17.493 --> 59:20.257
If he discovers my head's with you...

59:21.230 --> 59:22.925
Quickly!

59:22.999 --> 59:25.194
Climb into my hair.

59:27.503 --> 59:30.768
Why is she making those funny noises?

59:32.542 --> 59:35.978
Her body is with the king...

59:36.045 --> 59:37.979
and he is...

59:39.115 --> 59:41.811
tickling her feet.

59:41.884 --> 59:44.250
- Oh, no!
- Berthold.

59:44.320 --> 59:46.083
- Come on!
- Let go of me!

59:46.155 --> 59:48.123
- You're coming with us.
- No chance.

59:48.191 --> 59:50.955
- Why not?
- I can't remember.

59:51.027 --> 59:52.824
- Are you frightened?
- That's it!

59:52.895 --> 59:55.455
- Come on. Help me.
- Stop it!

59:57.300 --> 59:58.824
Quickly.

59:58.901 --> 01:00:02.803
Climb aboard.
Give me your hand.

01:00:04.507 --> 01:00:07.442
- Hold tight.
- I don't want to escape!

01:00:11.948 --> 01:00:15.577
- Here we go!
- Gosh! I can't hold on!

01:00:25.528 --> 01:00:29.089
I love these!
I tickle you till dawn, darling.

01:00:29.165 --> 01:00:30.962
There we go!

01:00:32.335 --> 01:00:35.532
There! I wipe everything away.
There! Tickley! Tickley!

01:00:37.340 --> 01:00:39.274
Darling, you love this!
I know you do!

01:00:39.342 --> 01:00:42.971
But you don't say anything!
Why you don't say anything?

01:00:43.045 --> 01:00:44.740
You are a pillow biter!

01:00:44.814 --> 01:00:46.304
Hey! Tickley! Tickley!

01:00:53.890 --> 01:00:59.157
Baron, I must get back to Roger
before he notices I am headless!

01:00:59.228 --> 01:01:01.059
I quite understand.

01:01:01.130 --> 01:01:05.499
Darling. Take me with you.

01:01:05.568 --> 01:01:09.800
- Back to Earth?
- Oh, yes!

01:01:11.407 --> 01:01:12.897
Without your body?

01:01:15.411 --> 01:01:17.879
I thought you loved me
for myself!

01:01:17.947 --> 01:01:20.040
I did.

01:01:20.116 --> 01:01:22.448
I mean, I do!
Of course, I do.

01:01:22.518 --> 01:01:24.383
- It's just...
- We have to go!

01:01:24.453 --> 01:01:28.981
I think you're right, aren't you?
It's impossible.

01:01:29.058 --> 01:01:31.993
Oh! Take a lock of my hair.

01:01:35.331 --> 01:01:39.267
Just a lock, cocky.
Not the whole carpet.

01:01:39.335 --> 01:01:40.893
I'll treasure it.

01:01:42.471 --> 01:01:45.031
The king! I must go!

01:01:45.942 --> 01:01:48.911
Au revoir, my dear Baron.

01:01:53.482 --> 01:01:57.612
Yes! I'm coming, Roger!

01:01:59.522 --> 01:02:02.355
Darling, I'm going to drive you
to China!

01:02:02.425 --> 01:02:03.756
Let it out!

01:02:03.826 --> 01:02:06.920
Oh, my God! Where is your head?

01:02:06.996 --> 01:02:09.396
No wonder you're so quiet.

01:02:09.465 --> 01:02:12.593
I'm too rough. I knock it off?
It's around here.

01:02:12.668 --> 01:02:14.636
I find it. We play "head and seek."

01:02:14.704 --> 01:02:17.798
Hold on! Oh, you play a trick?

01:02:17.873 --> 01:02:19.568
Darling, come out!

01:02:21.744 --> 01:02:23.871
You're not here!

01:02:23.946 --> 01:02:25.413
Where you...

01:02:26.482 --> 01:02:28.973
You are with the baron.

01:02:29.051 --> 01:02:32.179
You are with that little man.

01:02:32.254 --> 01:02:34.620
You told me
size don't make a difference!

01:02:34.690 --> 01:02:37.181
You puttana!

01:02:37.259 --> 01:02:38.726
No head to hit!

01:02:38.794 --> 01:02:42.389
I'll find you, Baron!
And then I kill you!

01:02:42.465 --> 01:02:45.434
Fetch me my radish club!

01:02:48.004 --> 01:02:50.438
Faster!

01:02:50.506 --> 01:02:53.600
I make a baron brochette! Sybil!

01:03:01.117 --> 01:03:03.108
Come on! Faster!

01:03:03.185 --> 01:03:06.780
But he can't! Berthold can hardly move!

01:03:06.856 --> 01:03:08.517
Take his weights off.

01:03:08.591 --> 01:03:11.355
- I have!
- What?

01:03:11.427 --> 01:03:15.625
- He's old! He can't run anymore.
- Nonsense!

01:03:15.698 --> 01:03:18.189
He's just out of practice.

01:03:22.938 --> 01:03:24.872
Come on, Berthold!

01:03:27.543 --> 01:03:28.976
Look for him!

01:03:29.045 --> 01:03:32.845
Nowhere to run to!
Nowhere to hide for you, Baron!

01:03:32.915 --> 01:03:35.315
What are you looking at?
Look down there!

01:03:35.384 --> 01:03:38.114
Come on!

01:03:38.187 --> 01:03:40.212
There he is, Sybil.

01:03:40.289 --> 01:03:42.120
Down there.

01:03:42.191 --> 01:03:44.318
I got you now, Baron!

01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:52.833
Wait, Sybil!

01:04:00.776 --> 01:04:02.266
Whoa!

01:04:04.713 --> 01:04:07.011
Wait! There they are!

01:04:07.083 --> 01:04:09.051
Are you hungry, my darling?

01:04:10.119 --> 01:04:12.178
All right. You take the baron.

01:04:12.254 --> 01:04:14.154
You take the bald one.
And for you, my sweet...

01:04:14.223 --> 01:04:16.191
the little girl
because you're my favorite.

01:04:16.258 --> 01:04:18.590
All right! Dinner is served!

01:04:21.831 --> 01:04:24.493
- Teamwork, Sybil!
- You go that way. I'll go this way.

01:04:24.567 --> 01:04:26.933
- You're the last of your species!
- Go on!

01:04:27.002 --> 01:04:28.697
Work with me! Stay together!

01:04:32.408 --> 01:04:34.774
No, girls! Don't split up on me now!

01:04:36.779 --> 01:04:38.440
Mayday!

01:04:38.514 --> 01:04:41.176
We're going down! Mayday!

01:04:45.087 --> 01:04:48.853
Sybil! Don't desert me now!

01:04:49.725 --> 01:04:51.556
I love you!

01:05:00.436 --> 01:05:01.767
I'm free!

01:05:01.837 --> 01:05:04.965
I'm free at last!
The body is dead!

01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:08.942
The body is dead! Long live the head!
It's finished!

01:05:09.011 --> 01:05:10.911
Bye, body!

01:05:10.980 --> 01:05:14.575
I shall prove a head
does not need a body to survive!

01:05:14.650 --> 01:05:16.811
I am omnipotent!

01:05:16.886 --> 01:05:19.719
Yes! Oh, no! I got an itch.

01:05:32.401 --> 01:05:34.266
Well done, Sally!

01:05:35.671 --> 01:05:37.195
Thanks!

01:05:41.277 --> 01:05:44.440
How great to see you!
What are you doing here?

01:05:44.513 --> 01:05:46.447
- Get off me!
- It's me!

01:05:46.515 --> 01:05:49.211
Berthold, your old servant! Remember?

01:05:49.285 --> 01:05:54.018
- Yes! We've been through all that.
- Where are we?

01:05:54.089 --> 01:05:56.523
On the Moon.

01:05:56.592 --> 01:05:59.789
Oh, yeah. Same old baron!

01:05:59.862 --> 01:06:03.093
- Can we go now?
- Get weaving.

01:06:03.165 --> 01:06:04.598
Hang on.

01:06:05.935 --> 01:06:08.529
It's all coming back.

01:06:08.604 --> 01:06:12.131
I've been stuck here
for over 20 years!

01:06:12.208 --> 01:06:15.109
Ever since you were last here
on the moon!

01:06:15.177 --> 01:06:18.476
You abandoned me here!
You swine!

01:06:18.547 --> 01:06:20.913
You toddled off
with that old queen of tarts...

01:06:20.983 --> 01:06:24.111
and left me to rot
in that parrot cage, didn't you?

01:06:24.186 --> 01:06:26.984
And now you come back,
just because it suits you...

01:06:27.056 --> 01:06:28.990
after wasting half my life...

01:06:29.058 --> 01:06:32.323
and expect me to follow you
to the ends of the Earth!

01:06:32.394 --> 01:06:33.986
Yes!

01:06:35.064 --> 01:06:36.224
All right.

01:06:55.651 --> 01:06:59.644
Do you know where
the rest of the gang are?

01:07:00.723 --> 01:07:02.213
Not a clue.

01:07:11.767 --> 01:07:16.227
This is precisely the sort of thing
that no one ever believes.

01:07:17.072 --> 01:07:19.006
Right, Berthold.

01:07:23.445 --> 01:07:25.379
You go first.

01:07:26.215 --> 01:07:28.149
Then Sally.

01:07:34.957 --> 01:07:36.390
Careful.

01:07:40.596 --> 01:07:42.530
Off you go.

01:07:54.476 --> 01:07:56.376
That's it!

01:07:57.813 --> 01:08:00.373
There's no more rope.

01:08:00.449 --> 01:08:03.816
- Mind now. I'm going back up.
- Wait a moment.

01:08:04.753 --> 01:08:07.551
Here! Tie this to the end of it.

01:08:08.324 --> 01:08:10.155
Where'd you get this?

01:08:10.225 --> 01:08:12.216
I cut it from the top.

01:08:13.862 --> 01:08:15.921
Naturally!
Where else would I get it?

01:08:15.998 --> 01:08:18.125
- But...
- Yes, yes!

01:08:19.201 --> 01:08:22.295
Splice it to the ends
so that we may continue our descent.

01:08:23.772 --> 01:08:26.138
Very clever. Great.

01:08:26.207 --> 01:08:28.301
Why didn't I think of that?

01:08:28.377 --> 01:08:31.868
That's why he's a baron
and I'm a prole.

01:08:37.986 --> 01:08:40.750
We'll never rescue them now!

01:08:49.264 --> 01:08:51.663
21/2% on the basic rate!

01:08:51.734 --> 01:08:54.532
- That's not enough!
- That's what I got to offer!

01:08:54.603 --> 01:08:57.935
And a separate agreement for overtime!

01:08:58.006 --> 01:08:59.303
Six percent!

01:09:03.578 --> 01:09:06.479
21/2%! Take it or leave it!

01:09:06.548 --> 01:09:09.984
Five percent or no increased production!

01:09:13.622 --> 01:09:15.953
We want more!

01:09:25.701 --> 01:09:28.225
I'm still in one piece!

01:09:28.303 --> 01:09:31.932
- I think.
- I can't imagine why.

01:09:32.006 --> 01:09:36.671
Our descent, in what I take to be
the volcano of Mount Etna...

01:09:36.745 --> 01:09:40.841
should have been slowed
by a rising cushion of warm air.

01:09:41.984 --> 01:09:43.917
Damn thing seems to have gone out.

01:09:45.254 --> 01:09:48.917
Oh, no! Not more giants!

01:09:52.060 --> 01:09:54.756
Can I help you tiny mortals?

01:09:56.031 --> 01:09:58.522
I sincerely hope so.

01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:00.693
I'm Baron Munchausen.

01:10:02.504 --> 01:10:04.495
You may have heard of me.

01:10:04.573 --> 01:10:06.438
My friends and I are looking
for three men:

01:10:06.508 --> 01:10:09.204
One with exceptional eyesight.

01:10:09.278 --> 01:10:12.679
One with superb hearing
and powerful lungs.

01:10:12.748 --> 01:10:14.909
One who is extremely large and strong.

01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:22.279
We're all extremely large
and strong here!

01:10:32.100 --> 01:10:35.763
I am Vulcan, the god.

01:10:36.839 --> 01:10:38.807
And these...

01:10:38.874 --> 01:10:42.708
are my giant employees...

01:10:42.778 --> 01:10:45.747
the cyclops...

01:10:45.814 --> 01:10:49.614
who even now are going back to work!

01:10:49.685 --> 01:10:51.619
Go slow!

01:10:53.856 --> 01:10:59.522
I'm willing to supply arms and equipment
to anyone prepared to pay the price!

01:10:59.595 --> 01:11:03.861
Greeks, Trojans, Romans, Huns.

01:11:03.932 --> 01:11:07.925
It's not my fault if they're
crazy enough to slaughter each other!

01:11:09.738 --> 01:11:12.764
You mankey crew!

01:11:12.841 --> 01:11:15.901
You go-slowers don't impress me!
I'm God.

01:11:15.978 --> 01:11:20.142
I've got all the time in the universe!
You hear that?

01:11:20.215 --> 01:11:21.944
All the time! Me!

01:11:22.017 --> 01:11:23.780
You know, in the old days...

01:11:23.852 --> 01:11:27.015
the staff used to get paid on the dot
every thousand years.

01:11:27.089 --> 01:11:29.683
This lot expect them every century.

01:11:29.758 --> 01:11:31.988
That is outrageous!

01:11:33.061 --> 01:11:35.154
What's this?

01:11:35.230 --> 01:11:37.698
This is our prototype.

01:11:37.766 --> 01:11:41.702
RX Intercontinental...

01:11:41.770 --> 01:11:43.761
Radar Sneaky...

01:11:43.839 --> 01:11:46.103
Multiwarheaded Nuclear Missile.

01:11:49.745 --> 01:11:52.373
- What does it do?
- Do?

01:11:52.447 --> 01:11:54.847
Kills the enemy.

01:11:54.917 --> 01:11:57.852
- All the enemy?
- Aye. All of them.

01:11:57.920 --> 01:12:01.515
All their wives,
children, sheep, cattle.

01:12:01.590 --> 01:12:03.854
And all their cats and dogs.

01:12:03.926 --> 01:12:07.054
All of them gone for good.

01:12:07.129 --> 01:12:08.619
That's horrible!

01:12:12.935 --> 01:12:17.269
Well, you see, the advantage is...

01:12:17.339 --> 01:12:21.799
you don't have to see
one single one of them die.

01:12:21.877 --> 01:12:24.402
You just sit comfortably...

01:12:24.479 --> 01:12:27.710
thousands of miles away
from the battlefield...

01:12:27.783 --> 01:12:30.775
and simply press the button.

01:12:31.853 --> 01:12:33.844
Well, where's the fun in that?

01:12:37.292 --> 01:12:40.819
We cater to all sorts here.

01:12:40.896 --> 01:12:43.524
You'd be surprised.

01:12:43.599 --> 01:12:47.501
Would you care for
a little fodder, perhaps?

01:13:00.048 --> 01:13:04.781
- Delicious!
- It's not a bad drop of tea...

01:13:04.853 --> 01:13:08.186
as far as nectar of the gods go.

01:13:08.256 --> 01:13:11.692
You can stay as long as you like.
It's nice to have company for tea.

01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:14.752
Thank you. It'll be a pleasure.

01:13:14.830 --> 01:13:18.596
I'm sorry, but we have to go soon.

01:13:18.667 --> 01:13:20.601
We're in a hurry.

01:13:25.107 --> 01:13:28.508
Here comes my midget manservant...

01:13:28.577 --> 01:13:30.602
with the petit fours.

01:13:32.481 --> 01:13:33.914
Albrecht!

01:13:36.351 --> 01:13:40.583
- Berthold! What are you doing here?
- Looking for you!

01:13:40.656 --> 01:13:43.454
I haven't got the treasure anymore!
I spent it!

01:13:43.525 --> 01:13:45.652
I mean, I gave it all to charity.

01:13:45.727 --> 01:13:47.661
I don't want the treasure.

01:13:47.729 --> 01:13:50.755
Albrecht, this is Sally.
Sally, Albrecht.

01:13:50.832 --> 01:13:51.958
Hello.

01:13:53.468 --> 01:13:56.266
I want you to help us
fight the Turk again.

01:13:57.139 --> 01:13:58.834
No. I couldn't do that.

01:13:58.907 --> 01:14:01.239
Not since I found myself.

01:14:01.309 --> 01:14:05.268
I never really wanted to be
big and strong...

01:14:05.347 --> 01:14:07.281
and lug heavy things about.

01:14:07.349 --> 01:14:11.342
I now know I want to be dainty
and sensitive.

01:14:11.420 --> 01:14:15.652
They call me their midget down here.
I love it. It's bliss.

01:14:16.391 --> 01:14:17.858
He's gone funny.

01:15:13.582 --> 01:15:15.379
Hello.

01:16:01.163 --> 01:16:03.529
My darling.

01:16:03.598 --> 01:16:05.657
My dearest.

01:16:13.375 --> 01:16:17.573
Excuse me. May I introduce you
to Baron Munchausen...

01:16:17.646 --> 01:16:20.945
and his little friend over there...
Sally.

01:16:23.485 --> 01:16:25.578
And Berthold.

01:16:28.490 --> 01:16:31.482
This is Venus.

01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:33.551
The goddess.

01:16:33.628 --> 01:16:35.289
My wife.

01:16:36.598 --> 01:16:38.657
Madam.

01:16:38.733 --> 01:16:40.792
I am overwhelmed.

01:16:45.006 --> 01:16:46.837
Oh, my love!

01:16:46.908 --> 01:16:48.671
My life.

01:16:48.743 --> 01:16:51.610
The alpha and the omega
of my existence.

01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:53.910
I've got something here for you.

01:17:15.570 --> 01:17:18.004
A diamond.

01:17:18.073 --> 01:17:21.065
For you, my precious.

01:17:21.142 --> 01:17:26.205
You're so sweet.
Another diamond.

01:17:34.122 --> 01:17:35.612
Madam...

01:17:35.690 --> 01:17:40.821
I am, alas, unable to offer you
so splendid a gift.

01:17:40.896 --> 01:17:44.161
But allow me to say
that you excel in beauty...

01:17:44.232 --> 01:17:47.326
even the magnificent
Catherine the Great of Russia...

01:17:47.402 --> 01:17:49.700
Here we go.

01:17:49.771 --> 01:17:53.798
Who's hand in marriage
I once had the honor of declining.

01:17:53.875 --> 01:17:57.641
- Baron, you flatter me.
- Not one jot, madam.

01:17:57.712 --> 01:17:59.646
Not one tittle.

01:18:10.792 --> 01:18:13.852
What a handsome...

01:18:13.929 --> 01:18:15.362
moustache.

01:18:18.733 --> 01:18:22.328
Shall we dance?

01:18:51.967 --> 01:18:54.435
Come and see the ballroom.

01:19:26.501 --> 01:19:28.765
Nice, isn't it?

01:19:28.837 --> 01:19:31.067
We've just had it done!

01:19:31.139 --> 01:19:33.073
You know that?

01:19:43.885 --> 01:19:46.183
I can dance.

01:19:46.254 --> 01:19:48.654
Here. Watch this.

01:20:38.807 --> 01:20:40.741
Sally, you can dance, can't you?

01:20:40.809 --> 01:20:42.902
No.

01:20:42.977 --> 01:20:44.911
Thanks a lot!

01:20:55.723 --> 01:20:57.156
Stop!

01:21:03.932 --> 01:21:06.457
Can we go now?

01:21:07.802 --> 01:21:09.235
Hello!

01:21:15.910 --> 01:21:19.107
Stop it! Come down!

01:21:20.048 --> 01:21:22.539
We've got to get back!

01:21:22.617 --> 01:21:26.849
We've got to get back
and save the town!

01:21:27.789 --> 01:21:29.586
Please, Baron!

01:21:29.657 --> 01:21:31.591
Please!

01:21:31.659 --> 01:21:34.628
Don't fret!
The town is in no immediate danger.

01:21:59.487 --> 01:22:01.887
The baron's kissing your wife.

01:22:03.024 --> 01:22:04.116
What?

01:22:07.829 --> 01:22:09.763
I mean... What?

01:22:39.127 --> 01:22:41.789
You're a harlot!

01:22:41.863 --> 01:22:45.264
Whore! Did you hear? Whore!

01:22:48.736 --> 01:22:53.833
That's enough of that!
You stop it!

01:22:55.610 --> 01:22:57.134
Wait. Please!

01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:03.010
- But darling!
- Don't you "darling" me!

01:23:07.155 --> 01:23:10.454
Do something! Save him!

01:23:12.527 --> 01:23:14.495
Darling, don't be jealous!

01:23:14.562 --> 01:23:18.658
Jealous! I'm not jealous!

01:23:20.201 --> 01:23:23.693
- Give him back to me!
- Excuse me.

01:23:25.473 --> 01:23:27.134
You never let me have any friends!

01:23:27.208 --> 01:23:31.144
I won't have you wiggling
at philanderers, you floozy!

01:23:32.280 --> 01:23:34.874
- Sir, I must assure you...
- Floozy!

01:23:34.949 --> 01:23:37.509
I am a goddess!
I can do what I like!

01:23:37.585 --> 01:23:41.248
And I am the god, so shut up!

01:23:44.926 --> 01:23:48.089
- Excuse me...
- Put him down, you brute!

01:23:49.597 --> 01:23:52.532
- Ungrateful mortal!
- Please don't!

01:23:53.268 --> 01:23:54.929
You'll pay for this!

01:23:55.003 --> 01:23:58.461
- You hear me?
- I insist that the lady is blameless.

01:24:02.910 --> 01:24:04.707
Please! Put the baron down!

01:24:04.779 --> 01:24:08.180
- Let's not be too hasty!
- He's always like that!

01:24:16.958 --> 01:24:21.759
- What have you done to them?
- You small-minded, petty, bourgeoise...

01:24:21.829 --> 01:24:24.696
Shut up, you trollop!

01:24:25.767 --> 01:24:29.897
- What have you done to the baron?
- You want the baron?

01:24:29.971 --> 01:24:31.939
You can have the baron!

01:24:33.041 --> 01:24:35.874
No, thanks. It's okay!
I don't need him!

01:24:47.322 --> 01:24:49.449
Did you enjoy that?

01:24:53.161 --> 01:24:55.186
Did I...

01:24:55.263 --> 01:24:57.197
excite you?

01:26:21.916 --> 01:26:24.043
I can't swim!

01:26:29.924 --> 01:26:33.758
What's happening?
You've got old again.

01:26:33.828 --> 01:26:35.887
What do you expect?

01:26:35.963 --> 01:26:38.523
I've just been expelled
from a state of bliss.

01:26:38.599 --> 01:26:42.535
- It's all your fault!
- Where are we?

01:26:42.603 --> 01:26:45.367
Answer me!

01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:49.672
The most probable explanation...
if you're not a sceptic...

01:26:49.744 --> 01:26:53.703
is we've dropped through the center of
the world and come out the other side...

01:26:53.781 --> 01:26:55.646
somewhere in the South Seas.

01:26:55.716 --> 01:26:57.775
That's miles away.

01:26:57.852 --> 01:27:00.446
Oh! Well done.

01:27:00.521 --> 01:27:03.684
- I was happy in my volcano.
- So was I.

01:27:03.758 --> 01:27:06.249
Look! An island!

01:27:09.597 --> 01:27:13.089
- Is there a volcano in it?
- Shut up about your poxy volcano!

01:27:17.238 --> 01:27:20.867
I think there is a volcano on it.

01:27:27.014 --> 01:27:28.572
It's moving!

01:27:28.649 --> 01:27:31.447
I spy with my little eye...

01:27:31.519 --> 01:27:33.453
something beginning with "M."

01:27:34.489 --> 01:27:36.389
It's the demon of the deep!

01:27:36.457 --> 01:27:39.358
That begins with "D," you klutz!

01:27:39.427 --> 01:27:41.987
It's "M" for monster!

01:27:47.835 --> 01:27:49.598
Will it eat us?

01:27:49.670 --> 01:27:51.433
With any luck.

01:29:08.215 --> 01:29:09.682
Baron!

01:29:18.259 --> 01:29:20.193
Give me a hand.

01:29:21.429 --> 01:29:23.522
He looks dead to me.

01:29:23.598 --> 01:29:26.032
He can't be dead!

01:29:26.100 --> 01:29:27.863
Go ahead.

01:29:27.935 --> 01:29:29.869
Let's put him there.

01:29:32.974 --> 01:29:35.875
He doesn't look very perky, does he?

01:29:37.778 --> 01:29:39.439
Is there a doctor in the fish?

01:29:42.416 --> 01:29:44.884
No doctors.

01:29:48.556 --> 01:29:52.219
We've got to get him warm and dry.

01:29:52.293 --> 01:29:54.261
What's that noise?

01:29:54.996 --> 01:29:57.521
It's music.

01:29:58.833 --> 01:30:00.767
That's not music.

01:30:01.669 --> 01:30:02.601
Look!

01:30:04.538 --> 01:30:06.267
There's a light.

01:30:06.340 --> 01:30:08.274
Come on!

01:30:15.216 --> 01:30:17.150
This way.

01:30:17.218 --> 01:30:18.651
Careful.

01:30:54.188 --> 01:30:57.123
Once I had a sweetheart

01:30:57.191 --> 01:30:59.352
A sweetheart, once I had

01:30:59.427 --> 01:31:02.624
She was the truest

01:31:02.697 --> 01:31:04.358
Excuse me!

01:31:04.432 --> 01:31:05.865
Hello!

01:31:07.768 --> 01:31:09.929
We need some help.

01:31:11.138 --> 01:31:12.867
Excuse me!

01:31:16.177 --> 01:31:18.873
- We need some help.
- No doctors.

01:31:22.183 --> 01:31:24.515
Once I had a sweetheart

01:31:24.585 --> 01:31:28.385
Do I hear the baron?

01:31:28.456 --> 01:31:29.889
Eh?

01:31:31.559 --> 01:31:33.493
Do I hear the baron?

01:31:34.495 --> 01:31:36.622
No doctors.

01:31:36.697 --> 01:31:38.927
Do I hear the baron?

01:31:38.999 --> 01:31:40.933
I just said that!

01:31:41.001 --> 01:31:43.936
Use your trumpet!

01:31:48.209 --> 01:31:50.803
Adolphus! Gustavus!

01:31:50.878 --> 01:31:53.073
Is it really you?

01:31:53.147 --> 01:31:55.172
Baron! Berthold!

01:31:55.249 --> 01:31:59.185
- Albrecht!
- I don't believe it!

01:31:59.253 --> 01:32:00.982
It's Berthold!

01:32:03.891 --> 01:32:08.123
Sally, this is Adolphus, who used
to be able to hit a bull's eye...

01:32:08.195 --> 01:32:10.527
from halfway 'round the world.

01:32:10.598 --> 01:32:12.725
And this is Gustavus...

01:32:12.800 --> 01:32:15.997
who could blow over a whole forest
with just one breath!

01:32:16.070 --> 01:32:19.198
Those were the days! Aye?

01:32:19.273 --> 01:32:24.176
When we were young and alive!

01:32:25.412 --> 01:32:26.936
How do you mean?

01:32:27.014 --> 01:32:29.505
It's no good fighting it.

01:32:29.583 --> 01:32:32.609
- We're not dead!
- You have to accept it.

01:32:32.686 --> 01:32:37.089
We're all dead here.
This is hell!

01:32:37.158 --> 01:32:39.388
- Heaven.
- Hell!

01:32:39.460 --> 01:32:40.791
Heaven!

01:32:40.861 --> 01:32:43.022
Don't be stupid.

01:32:45.699 --> 01:32:49.567
Well, sit down. Relax.
Have a game.

01:32:49.637 --> 01:32:54.734
You're dead for a very long time.

01:32:55.643 --> 01:32:57.804
Come on. Sit down.

01:32:57.878 --> 01:33:00.346
Let's have a nice game.

01:33:00.414 --> 01:33:02.575
What are you doing?

01:33:04.885 --> 01:33:06.853
You're giving up, aren't you?

01:33:07.922 --> 01:33:10.891
You can't give up!
I won't let you!

01:33:10.958 --> 01:33:12.858
Go away. Clear off.

01:33:16.931 --> 01:33:20.423
What about Rose and Daisy
and my father...

01:33:20.501 --> 01:33:22.298
and all the others?

01:33:22.369 --> 01:33:26.430
- You promised to help them!
- They are perfectly safe.

01:33:33.447 --> 01:33:36.075
They can look after themselves.

01:33:40.754 --> 01:33:45.282
Besides, there are
more important things.

01:33:45.359 --> 01:33:47.520
Such as?

01:33:47.595 --> 01:33:49.028
Well...

01:34:05.112 --> 01:34:07.046
You horrible little brat!

01:34:12.219 --> 01:34:16.656
Can't you let me die in peace
once in a while?

01:34:44.251 --> 01:34:45.741
Bucephalus!

01:34:45.819 --> 01:34:49.550
My Bucephalus!

01:34:51.258 --> 01:34:53.886
You must have heard me shouting.

01:34:54.828 --> 01:34:57.661
This is a good omen, what?

01:34:57.731 --> 01:34:59.323
Oh, yeah.

01:35:02.303 --> 01:35:04.897
Prepare a rowing boat
and be ready to leave.

01:35:06.640 --> 01:35:09.370
Come on, boy.

01:35:09.443 --> 01:35:11.911
I have learned from experience...

01:35:11.979 --> 01:35:16.712
that a modicum of snuff
can be most efficacious.

01:36:22.716 --> 01:36:25.014
I'll never eat fish again.

01:36:27.654 --> 01:36:29.645
Where's the baron?

01:36:45.439 --> 01:36:47.373
Baron, where are you?

01:36:58.085 --> 01:37:00.451
It's the baron!

01:37:07.094 --> 01:37:08.288
Come on.

01:37:10.130 --> 01:37:12.291
I can't keep this up forever!

01:37:35.255 --> 01:37:38.053
Look! The town!

01:37:38.125 --> 01:37:40.059
We're here!

01:37:42.496 --> 01:37:43.929
Look!

01:37:45.499 --> 01:37:47.729
The flag's still flying!

01:37:47.801 --> 01:37:50.702
I told you there was nothing
to worry about.

01:37:52.906 --> 01:37:53.838
Fire!

01:37:55.576 --> 01:37:57.441
Oh, my God!

01:37:57.511 --> 01:37:59.376
It's the sultan's army!

01:37:59.446 --> 01:38:01.846
Quick! Back in the fish!

01:38:04.651 --> 01:38:07.017
They're inviting us to defeat them.

01:38:07.087 --> 01:38:10.352
We must oblige them.
On the count of three!

01:38:13.660 --> 01:38:17.357
Gustavus! Blow them back to Asia Minor.

01:38:17.431 --> 01:38:20.696
Adolphus, find the sultan
and shoot him!

01:38:20.767 --> 01:38:23.065
Albrecht, row for the shore!

01:38:23.137 --> 01:38:26.766
Berthold, make yourself useful!

01:38:26.840 --> 01:38:28.603
One, two, three!

01:38:28.675 --> 01:38:30.233
Could you make that four?

01:38:33.013 --> 01:38:34.913
We're going down!

01:38:37.317 --> 01:38:38.944
Abandon ship!

01:38:41.522 --> 01:38:43.581
I think the ship's
abandoning us, mate!

01:38:48.295 --> 01:38:50.160
Jump!

01:38:54.067 --> 01:38:55.125
Attack!

01:39:04.044 --> 01:39:05.978
I still can't swim.

01:39:16.190 --> 01:39:19.523
- This is absolutely dreadful!
- It's hopeless.

01:39:19.593 --> 01:39:23.188
I've never before been
in such a disastrous rout!

01:39:23.263 --> 01:39:25.527
I'm usually on the winning side!

01:39:25.599 --> 01:39:28.693
If you weren't so competitive,
you wouldn't get so upset!

01:39:28.769 --> 01:39:31.101
Albrecht's useless!

01:39:31.171 --> 01:39:34.106
We might as well give up now.

01:39:35.375 --> 01:39:39.004
You mustn't say that! Not you!

01:39:44.818 --> 01:39:47.946
If we begin attacking
in two directions simultaneously...

01:39:48.021 --> 01:39:50.649
we confound surprise with confusion.

01:39:50.724 --> 01:39:54.717
Albrecht and Gustavus will provide
the major themes to the battle...

01:39:54.795 --> 01:39:56.990
- while Adolphus and...
- Baron.

01:39:57.064 --> 01:40:00.329
Don't interrupt. What is it?

01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:02.630
This isn't going to work.

01:40:02.703 --> 01:40:07.333
- What do you mean?
- They're all old and tired now.

01:40:07.407 --> 01:40:09.466
It isn't like it used to be.

01:40:10.744 --> 01:40:12.371
Don't you see?

01:40:20.087 --> 01:40:22.681
Where are you going?

01:40:22.756 --> 01:40:25.350
- To give myself up.
- What?

01:40:25.425 --> 01:40:29.361
I gave my word I'd raze the siege
and save the town.

01:40:29.429 --> 01:40:31.226
I gathered you for that purpose.

01:40:35.769 --> 01:40:38.636
If you want to see
Baron Munchausen again...

01:40:38.705 --> 01:40:41.071
you'd better do something about it.

01:40:44.678 --> 01:40:46.543
You can't give yourself up!

01:40:46.613 --> 01:40:49.013
They might kill you!

01:40:49.082 --> 01:40:53.246
We'll have spent all that time
in that smelly fish for nothing.

01:40:53.320 --> 01:40:54.753
Well!

01:41:25.819 --> 01:41:29.084
So it's agreed.
Friday, the 28th...

01:41:29.156 --> 01:41:32.148
you surrender...
that's three weeks from tomorrow.

01:41:32.225 --> 01:41:34.455
We can fix the details later.

01:41:34.528 --> 01:41:39.261
- No. You surrender.
- We've been through all this.

01:41:39.333 --> 01:41:42.131
- You surrender.
- But we're winning.

01:41:42.202 --> 01:41:44.636
- We surrendered last time.
- So?

01:41:44.705 --> 01:41:46.400
Now it's your turn.

01:41:46.473 --> 01:41:49.340
Oh. What about the virgins?

01:41:49.409 --> 01:41:52.469
Please. Forget the virgins.

01:41:52.546 --> 01:41:54.776
We're out of virgins.

01:41:54.848 --> 01:41:57.612
Let us, instead, concentrate
on reaching a rational...

01:41:57.684 --> 01:41:59.618
sensible, civilized agreement...

01:41:59.686 --> 01:42:03.452
which will guarantee a world
fit for science, progress and...

01:42:03.523 --> 01:42:05.286
But not Baron Munchausen!

01:42:07.361 --> 01:42:11.161
- You! You old lunatic!
- I'm afraid so.

01:42:11.231 --> 01:42:13.722
Help! Guards! Murder!

01:42:14.868 --> 01:42:17.496
- Who let this man into my tent?
- Sultan!

01:42:17.571 --> 01:42:22.440
If you are still interested
in my head, it's yours.

01:42:22.509 --> 01:42:24.443
I'm tired of it.

01:42:24.511 --> 01:42:26.809
Send for the executioner!

01:42:26.880 --> 01:42:28.313
So, Mr. Jackson.

01:42:28.382 --> 01:42:31.146
Still the rational man?

01:42:31.218 --> 01:42:35.587
How many people have perished
in your logical little war?

01:42:35.655 --> 01:42:39.386
There are certain rules
to the proper conduct of living.

01:42:39.459 --> 01:42:43.327
We cannot fly to the moon.
We cannot defy death.

01:42:43.397 --> 01:42:45.228
We must face the facts.

01:42:45.298 --> 01:42:50.167
Not the folly of fantasists like you
who don't live in the real world...

01:42:50.237 --> 01:42:54.173
and who consequently come
to a very sticky end.

01:43:32.112 --> 01:43:34.876
Have you any famous last words?

01:43:34.948 --> 01:43:36.939
Not yet.

01:43:37.684 --> 01:43:40.551
"Not yet"?
Is that famous?

01:43:42.289 --> 01:43:44.018
The man's a buffoon.

01:43:45.959 --> 01:43:47.017
Executioner...

01:43:48.528 --> 01:43:49.688
execute.

01:44:11.685 --> 01:44:12.811
Now!

01:44:20.393 --> 01:44:22.384
He did it!

01:44:29.336 --> 01:44:30.803
Bring him back!

01:44:34.441 --> 01:44:36.739
- Stop that man!
- Hey!

01:44:58.498 --> 01:45:00.864
I knew we could do it!
All together now!

01:45:22.722 --> 01:45:24.553
Steady!

01:45:27.561 --> 01:45:29.358
Well blown, Gustavus!

01:45:46.246 --> 01:45:48.908
- They're coming!
- Go on!

01:45:48.982 --> 01:45:51.473
Hurry!
Quickly now!

01:46:22.115 --> 01:46:23.673
Come on!

01:46:35.862 --> 01:46:37.796
Berthold, run!

01:47:38.091 --> 01:47:41.527
Damn it, man! Make yourself useful!
I can't do everything!

01:47:46.866 --> 01:47:49.926
- This way!
- Careful!

01:48:01.381 --> 01:48:03.713
That's the way.

01:49:03.977 --> 01:49:05.945
Watch it!

01:49:16.689 --> 01:49:18.623
Gently this time.

01:49:20.794 --> 01:49:22.227
Gently.

01:50:01.067 --> 01:50:02.500
Help!

01:51:15.074 --> 01:51:16.666
We did it!

01:51:32.792 --> 01:51:35.625
Hurray!

01:51:35.695 --> 01:51:37.822
Look! They don't believe it!

01:51:37.897 --> 01:51:40.229
We've won!

01:51:40.300 --> 01:51:42.860
We beat them!

01:51:49.475 --> 01:51:52.137
Yipee! Thank God!

01:51:52.211 --> 01:51:55.442
- Good riddance! And don't come back!
- We won!

01:51:55.515 --> 01:51:58.382
But of course!

01:52:28.681 --> 01:52:31.775
We won! Oh, the joy!

01:53:05.685 --> 01:53:07.949
Get me down!

01:53:16.195 --> 01:53:17.924
Oh, my goodness!

01:53:20.533 --> 01:53:22.364
- In the church tower!
- He's dying!

01:53:36.215 --> 01:53:37.978
- There he is!
- Shoot him!

01:53:38.751 --> 01:53:40.548
Oh! Damn!

01:53:40.620 --> 01:53:44.818
Bring a doctor! Quickly!
Fetch a doctor!

01:53:44.891 --> 01:53:47.189
Don't leave me, Baron. Please!

01:53:47.260 --> 01:53:51.959
- Don't leave me!
- Get off him! Give him some air!

01:53:55.368 --> 01:53:58.997
- Here is a doctor.
- Sally!

01:54:02.375 --> 01:54:04.809
Take care of Sally.

01:54:04.877 --> 01:54:07.869
No doctors.

01:54:29.135 --> 01:54:31.535
- Get away!
- Stop!

01:54:31.604 --> 01:54:33.071
Leave him alone!

01:54:36.075 --> 01:54:39.408
- She's having a fit!
- Go away!

01:54:44.951 --> 01:54:46.509
Stop it!

01:54:59.132 --> 01:55:00.929
He's dead.

01:56:07.066 --> 01:56:12.026
And that was only one of the many
occasions where I met my death.

01:56:12.104 --> 01:56:16.837
An experience which I don't
hesitate strongly...

01:56:16.909 --> 01:56:18.740
to recommend.

01:56:18.811 --> 01:56:23.475
And so, with the help of my
inestimable servants...

01:56:23.549 --> 01:56:27.645
I defeated the Turks
and saved the day.

01:56:27.720 --> 01:56:29.847
And from that time forth...

01:56:29.922 --> 01:56:33.483
everyone who had a talent for it...

01:56:33.559 --> 01:56:36.687
lived happily ever after.

01:56:36.762 --> 01:56:40.664
Stop this nonsense at once!

01:56:40.733 --> 01:56:42.758
You, sir, are under arrest...

01:56:42.835 --> 01:56:47.272
for spreading ridiculous tales
at a time of great danger.

01:56:47.340 --> 01:56:49.740
When the enemy is at the gate.
Arrest him.

01:56:50.943 --> 01:56:53.036
Open the gates.

01:56:55.414 --> 01:56:57.882
I order you to arrest that man
at once!

01:56:59.652 --> 01:57:03.748
Am I or am I not
the elected representative?

01:57:03.823 --> 01:57:06.223
- Arrest him!
- Open the gates!

01:57:10.096 --> 01:57:11.358
This way!

01:57:13.432 --> 01:57:14.922
Come on!

01:57:16.068 --> 01:57:18.593
Do not open the gate!

01:57:18.671 --> 01:57:22.129
The Turk is outside,
and we are not about to surrender.

01:57:23.376 --> 01:57:25.310
Open the gates!

01:57:28.047 --> 01:57:32.916
Come on, dear ladies!
Forward, the players!

01:57:32.985 --> 01:57:35.112
Do not open the gate!

01:57:36.956 --> 01:57:39.220
Keep up! Steady as you go.

01:57:39.292 --> 01:57:42.591
Get back! I'm warning you!
Do not open those gates!

01:57:43.596 --> 01:57:45.530
- This way!
- Anyone who opens those gates...

01:57:45.598 --> 01:57:47.259
is guilty of treason!

01:57:49.001 --> 01:57:51.663
Follow me!

01:57:52.805 --> 01:57:55.740
This way, my friends!

01:57:59.312 --> 01:58:01.644
The gates will remain closed.

01:58:01.714 --> 01:58:03.648
Open the gates!

01:58:05.251 --> 01:58:08.982
- Shoot anyone who disobeys my orders!
- Ready!

01:58:09.055 --> 01:58:10.317
Aim!

01:58:13.192 --> 01:58:15.592
Hold your ground!

01:58:15.661 --> 01:58:17.424
Open the gates, dear friends...

01:58:17.496 --> 01:58:20.363
and let's seize the day!

01:58:20.433 --> 01:58:24.267
Or close our minds up
with inventions, death and fear.

01:58:24.337 --> 01:58:26.328
There's nothing so
destroys a man...

01:58:26.405 --> 01:58:28.532
as ignorance and conformity!

01:58:28.607 --> 01:58:30.768
Grasp for the mantle!

01:58:30.843 --> 01:58:33.778
- Grasp the...
- No!

01:58:33.846 --> 01:58:35.609
Quite wrong!

01:58:35.681 --> 01:58:38.047
Open the gates!

01:58:39.752 --> 01:58:41.310
Shoot them!

01:58:45.191 --> 01:58:47.716
Shoot these people at once!

01:58:56.902 --> 01:59:00.998
Aye! So! It's treason, is it?

01:59:01.073 --> 01:59:03.098
Treason!

01:59:03.175 --> 01:59:04.870
Right!

01:59:04.944 --> 01:59:07.606
You're all under arrest!
All of you!

01:59:07.680 --> 01:59:09.477
This is all your fault!

01:59:09.548 --> 01:59:11.243
Get inside my office now!

01:59:40.579 --> 01:59:42.911
Cheers for the baron!

01:59:42.982 --> 01:59:45.382
Hooray!

01:59:59.932 --> 02:00:02.196
My Bucephalus.

02:00:02.268 --> 02:00:04.202
Good boy.

02:00:10.109 --> 02:00:11.770
Come on.

02:00:16.615 --> 02:00:19.743
Beautiful ladies.

02:00:40.639 --> 02:00:43.574
It wasn't just a story, was it?
