WEBVTT

00:01.200 --> 00:03.733
Narrator: In a classic display
of macaque power dynamics,

00:03.733 --> 00:06.566
the alpha male bears his
teeth at the interloper...

00:06.566 --> 00:08.133
Hey, sleepy.

00:08.133 --> 00:10.033
You should
go to bed.

00:10.033 --> 00:11.200
(yawning)

00:11.200 --> 00:12.066
Yeah.

00:13.033 --> 00:15.466
I should, I am
exhausted.

00:15.466 --> 00:17.333
Narrator: The encounter
between the two macaques

00:17.333 --> 00:18.533
reaches a
fevered pitch.

00:18.533 --> 00:19.333
(macaques screech)

00:19.333 --> 00:20.333
Wow.

00:21.600 --> 00:23.333
Monkeys,
get a room.

00:23.333 --> 00:26.000
(inhales through teeth,
clears throat)

00:26.000 --> 00:26.466
Are you coming?

00:26.466 --> 00:27.133
(sighs)

00:27.133 --> 00:28.466
I can't.

00:28.466 --> 00:30.100
I left all this weekend's
marking to the last minute.

00:30.100 --> 00:32.433
You know, I shouldn't
even be watching this.

00:32.433 --> 00:33.500
Okay, good night.

00:33.500 --> 00:34.300
(kiss)

00:34.300 --> 00:35.566
Don't stay up
too late.

00:35.566 --> 00:37.033
Okay.

00:37.033 --> 00:40.333
Erica: Our partner. We
see them as a refuge;

00:40.333 --> 00:44.033
the one person we can truly
reveal ourselves to.

00:44.033 --> 00:45.466
They see us when
we're crazy,

00:45.466 --> 00:47.000
when we're
moody,

00:47.000 --> 00:50.500
when we're tired -
they see it all.

00:50.500 --> 00:53.000
But do our partners
really know us

00:53.000 --> 00:55.033
as well as we
think they do?

00:55.033 --> 00:58.233
Or is the truth that we hide
more than we'd like to admit;

00:58.233 --> 01:00.033
that there are some
parts of ourselves

01:00.033 --> 01:02.000
that we never
reveal,

01:02.000 --> 01:05.099
that we'd rather
they'd not see?

01:06.400 --> 01:10.366
And what would happen
if one day they did?

01:10.366 --> 01:13.333
(woman moans,
Ethan grunts quietly)

01:13.333 --> 01:14.400
(glass shatters)

01:14.400 --> 01:16.200
(awkward gasps
and grunts)

01:16.200 --> 01:18.133
Erica:
Oh, um...

01:18.133 --> 01:19.666
I was just... sorry.

01:21.266 --> 01:23.666
Uh... um...

01:23.666 --> 01:24.700

Morning.

02:19.166 --> 02:20.100
Morning.

02:27.166 --> 02:29.100
So, about
last night...

02:29.100 --> 02:30.700
We don't have to
talk about it.

02:30.700 --> 02:33.333
No, I know that we
don't have to, but I...

02:33.333 --> 02:35.166
I just wanna say that,
honestly,

02:35.166 --> 02:37.700
it's fine if you...

02:38.333 --> 02:39.500
'cause everyone does...

02:39.500 --> 02:40.733
And I do.

02:40.733 --> 02:42.366
And you live
here now, so...

02:42.366 --> 02:45.066
Can we just drop it?

02:45.066 --> 02:47.400
Please?

02:47.400 --> 02:48.466
Sure. yeah.

02:49.466 --> 02:50.766
Okay, bye.

02:50.766 --> 02:52.333
Oh, yeah.
Well...

02:52.333 --> 02:53.033
(awkwardly)

02:53.033 --> 02:54.600
'Kay. okay.

03:01.533 --> 03:03.600
So our first
real meeting

03:03.600 --> 03:05.600
with the author of
"The Sex Scoop."

03:05.600 --> 03:07.000
Welcome, Alexis.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.200
I'd like to make sure
that this book is 50-50:

03:09.200 --> 03:12.300
50 percent female sexuality,
50 percent male.

03:12.300 --> 03:13.466
Absolutely.

03:13.466 --> 03:15.100
Also, I'd like to see some
case studies in here.

03:15.100 --> 03:17.200
Mm-hm. I think where
we're going with this

03:17.200 --> 03:19.300
is real couples,
real problems,

03:19.300 --> 03:20.766
told from both
points of view.

03:20.766 --> 03:22.366
Got it.

03:23.366 --> 03:24.500
For example:

03:24.500 --> 03:26.633
I have a friend in a
committed relationship,

03:26.633 --> 03:28.233
who is in love,

03:28.233 --> 03:30.666
who told me, that the
other night, she...

03:30.666 --> 03:32.600
She caught her
boyfriend--

03:32.600 --> 03:33.766
Masturbating.

03:33.766 --> 03:34.766
No.

03:34.766 --> 03:38.300
Yeah. to really bad
computer porn.

03:38.300 --> 03:39.566
Alexis and Julianne:
(tight inhale)

03:39.566 --> 03:41.566
Okay, so she caught
him and...?

03:41.566 --> 03:43.100
Uh, her question
for me

03:43.100 --> 03:46.266
was if he can do it
with her for real

03:46.266 --> 03:47.733
then why would he...

03:47.733 --> 03:50.600
Julianne: why would he feel the
need to "engage" his auto pilot?

03:50.600 --> 03:51.633
Erica: Yes.

03:51.633 --> 03:54.566
Relatable,
I like that.

03:54.566 --> 03:56.000
Alexis: Excuse
me, but...

03:56.000 --> 03:57.233
Kai: Mm-hmm.

03:57.233 --> 03:59.200
We're looking for a man's
point of view here.

03:59.200 --> 04:01.000
Oh, Alexis...

04:01.000 --> 04:03.200
I'm a sex therapist.
And if you don't mind,

04:03.200 --> 04:05.233
I'd like to ask you
a personal question.

04:05.233 --> 04:06.266
Yeah, I don't mind.

04:07.600 --> 04:09.200
Why do men
masturbate?

04:09.200 --> 04:11.566
Erica: Oh, is this
really necessary?

04:11.566 --> 04:13.766
Uh, when you're by yourself,
it's all about you.

04:13.766 --> 04:15.566
It's simple,
it's primal,

04:15.566 --> 04:17.500
and, in a pinch,
it's quick.

04:17.500 --> 04:19.300
(Alexis laughs)

04:19.300 --> 04:21.000
I couldn't have
put it better.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.533
Love your
honesty.

04:22.533 --> 04:26.066
And I'd love to interview you
for a, a case study, yes?

04:26.066 --> 04:27.066
Call me.

04:28.666 --> 04:31.400
That should help
demystify things

04:31.400 --> 04:33.333
for your friend.

04:33.333 --> 04:36.400
Julianne: Okay, we need to
have more meetings here.

04:36.400 --> 04:37.400
(Alexis chuckles)

04:40.633 --> 04:42.166
Erica's just
doing her job.

04:42.166 --> 04:44.033
She's not in league
with Julianne.

04:44.033 --> 04:45.433
Right, Erica's all
sugar and spice.

04:45.433 --> 04:47.033
Come on, inside,
she's a tiger

04:47.033 --> 04:48.633
and she's eclipsed you
in record time.

04:48.633 --> 04:49.600
Scott:
Thomas.

04:49.600 --> 04:51.466
Thomas Friedken,
in the flesh!

04:51.466 --> 04:52.566
How goes it, buddy?

04:52.566 --> 04:54.200
Great.
Thank you.

04:54.200 --> 04:55.466
You remember
Scott Galvin?

04:55.466 --> 04:57.500
He's taken the reigns
while his father is away.

04:57.500 --> 04:58.500
Yeah, dad's off,

04:58.500 --> 05:00.566
big-game hunting
for talent in India.

05:00.566 --> 05:02.433
It's like a gold rush
over there,

05:02.433 --> 05:03.400
ever since slumdog.

05:03.400 --> 05:04.466
I'll bet.

05:04.466 --> 05:06.566
Meantime, I'm holding
down the fort.

05:06.566 --> 05:08.666
So, how can
I help you?

05:09.733 --> 05:12.233
To be perfectly honest,
I'm not sure you can.

05:12.233 --> 05:13.533
(chuckles)

05:13.533 --> 05:14.633
Come on, let's talk.

05:15.666 --> 05:17.200
(telephone rings)

05:20.066 --> 05:21.333
Erica Strange.

05:21.333 --> 05:22.200
Samantha:
Hey.

05:22.200 --> 05:23.733
Hey, Sam!

05:23.733 --> 05:25.733
How's jolly
old England?

05:25.733 --> 05:28.700
Uh, I don't know.
I'm here.

05:28.700 --> 05:30.133
Here like
Toronto here?

05:30.133 --> 05:31.433
Samantha:
Yeah.

05:31.433 --> 05:33.400
Listen, would it be okay
if I crashed on your couch

05:33.400 --> 05:34.600
for a couple
of days?

05:34.600 --> 05:37.333
You and Josh wanna crash
on my crappy old couch?

05:37.333 --> 05:39.200
Um... Josh
didn't come.

05:40.200 --> 05:41.733
What?

05:41.733 --> 05:43.600
Sam, what's
going on?

05:43.600 --> 05:46.600
Look, can we talk about it
when I get to your place?

05:46.600 --> 05:47.600
Of course.
Yeah, um...

05:47.600 --> 05:49.533
I'll see you soon then.

05:57.233 --> 05:59.300
Once again, what does
a closed door mean?

05:59.300 --> 06:01.600
I'm stuck using
the handle?

06:01.600 --> 06:03.233
Oh, Scott!

06:03.233 --> 06:05.166
What a wonderful
surprise!

06:05.166 --> 06:06.500
Muah, muah.

06:06.500 --> 06:08.200
What, I need
to call first

06:08.200 --> 06:09.700
to see my favourite
department head?

06:09.700 --> 06:12.633
No! No, no, no. I have
an open door policy.

06:12.633 --> 06:15.633
Except for when it's closed -
which it never is to you.

06:15.633 --> 06:16.533
Please, sit.

06:16.533 --> 06:17.633
So, Friedken paid me

06:17.633 --> 06:19.433
a little "hello,
how do you do?"

06:19.433 --> 06:21.233
earlier today.

06:21.233 --> 06:22.166
Oh.

06:22.166 --> 06:23.633
He's pissed.

06:23.633 --> 06:26.100
Says you
humiliated him.

06:26.100 --> 06:28.066
I humiliated
him, hmm?

06:28.066 --> 06:31.100
Yeah, apparently,
you castrated him.

06:31.100 --> 06:32.366
Publicly.

06:32.366 --> 06:34.266
And since no man likes
having his nuts torn off,

06:34.266 --> 06:38.000
he's decided to pull
"The Mystery of Tomorrow."

06:38.000 --> 06:40.066
He can't.
He signed a contract.

06:40.066 --> 06:41.000
(exhales)

06:41.000 --> 06:42.633
You pooched it,
Julie-Jack,

06:42.633 --> 06:45.500
and now you
gotta fix it.

06:45.500 --> 06:47.500
Whatever it takes.

06:55.533 --> 06:57.300
(elevator door dings)

07:03.266 --> 07:05.000
(emergency button dings,
door whirs shut)

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
Uh, is
everything okay?

07:08.000 --> 07:09.200
Friedken got to
Scott Galvin

07:09.200 --> 07:11.433
and he told him he's
gonna pull the book

07:11.433 --> 07:13.666
because I
"castrated" him.

07:13.666 --> 07:15.000
Oh my god!

07:15.000 --> 07:17.233
And now they're saying
that I have to fix it.

07:17.233 --> 07:20.333
I have to do
whatever it takes.

07:20.333 --> 07:22.266
Damn it!
This is not happening!

07:22.266 --> 07:22.766
(crying)

07:22.766 --> 07:23.700
It's not!

07:23.700 --> 07:24.366
(stammering)

07:24.366 --> 07:25.300
'Kay, listen...

07:25.300 --> 07:27.133
We just need to
calm down, okay?

07:27.133 --> 07:30.000
And you need to get
yourself together here!

07:30.000 --> 07:32.566
I mean, you
commissioned this book.

07:32.566 --> 07:36.533
W-what does secret
number 26 say? Hm?

07:36.533 --> 07:38.400
"Never show weakness."

07:38.400 --> 07:40.466
Never show weakness.

07:40.466 --> 07:42.600
You know, use Friedken's
tactics against him.

07:42.600 --> 07:46.166
You do not give up
the power here.

07:46.166 --> 07:47.766
You know, you're right.

07:47.766 --> 07:50.500
You're right!
I need to be professional.

07:50.500 --> 07:52.266
I need to be,
uh, clear,

07:52.266 --> 07:53.066
Mm-hmm.

07:53.066 --> 07:54.700
And I need to
be firm.

07:54.700 --> 07:57.533
And Frank will understand
that even if Scott won't,

07:57.533 --> 07:59.733
because this is not
how he does business -

07:59.733 --> 08:01.466
at gunpoint.

08:01.466 --> 08:04.500
And...
And you're the boss.

08:04.500 --> 08:05.500
Yes.

08:07.466 --> 08:08.566
Yes I am.

08:08.566 --> 08:10.600
(button dings loudly)

08:10.600 --> 08:12.300
(relaxed breaths)

08:13.300 --> 08:14.366
Thank you.

08:14.366 --> 08:16.366
That was exactly
what I needed to hear.

08:17.600 --> 08:26.233
♪

08:26.233 --> 08:29.300
Welcome home!

08:29.300 --> 08:30.300
Uh...

08:32.466 --> 08:34.700
(Erica murmurs to herself)

08:34.700 --> 08:36.133
(exhales)

08:36.133 --> 08:37.733
Sam.

08:37.733 --> 08:38.533
Erica.

08:38.533 --> 08:39.333
(startled murmer)

08:39.333 --> 08:41.200
Dr. Fred.
Oh my god.

08:41.200 --> 08:42.033
(chuckles)

08:42.033 --> 08:43.400
Just thought I'd
check in,

08:43.400 --> 08:45.100
see how you like
the future.

08:45.100 --> 08:47.633
Oh, god, can we please talk
about that another time?

08:47.633 --> 08:48.633
Busy day?

08:48.633 --> 08:49.666
Oh, let's see...

08:49.666 --> 08:51.233
My boss is having
a nervous breakdown,

08:51.233 --> 08:53.433
and my sister just mysteriously
flew in from London

08:53.433 --> 08:55.433
without her husband and
she's clearly in crisis,

08:55.433 --> 08:56.433
and my boyfriend-

08:56.433 --> 08:58.700
Really likes his porn.

09:00.366 --> 09:02.300
What exactly
do you want from me?

09:02.300 --> 09:04.300
I wanna talk to you
about Kai -

09:04.300 --> 09:06.766
what you're gonna do and say,
now that you know.

09:06.766 --> 09:08.133
Look, I know that...

09:08.133 --> 09:09.366
That you're concerned
about your patient,

09:09.366 --> 09:11.766
but this really
isn't my area.

09:11.766 --> 09:13.233
So therapy for
you is...

09:13.233 --> 09:15.766
Get up, go see Tom,
redo a regret?

09:15.766 --> 09:17.066
Wash, rinse, repeat?

09:17.066 --> 09:18.066
(laughs)

09:18.066 --> 09:20.066
Not exactly how
I'd put it. no.

09:20.066 --> 09:21.733
And how exactly
would you put it?

09:24.100 --> 09:28.233
Yeah, you know what?
I, I really need to go.

09:29.100 --> 09:30.100
(frustrated sigh)

09:44.233 --> 09:45.633
As therapists, Fred,

09:45.633 --> 09:49.100
you and I are bound
by a protocol.

09:49.566 --> 09:53.166
You get my permission
before talking to Erica.

09:53.166 --> 09:55.600
Look, if you brought me
in here for a fight,

09:55.600 --> 09:57.433
You win, okay?

09:57.433 --> 09:59.200
I don't have the
patience for it.

09:59.200 --> 10:01.400
And I don't have the
patience to watch you

10:01.400 --> 10:02.400
take Erica
off course.

10:02.400 --> 10:03.533
Off course?!

10:03.533 --> 10:05.466
Oh, that girl is so
strictly on course,

10:05.466 --> 10:08.666
you'd be lucky if you'll
ever wean her off it.

10:08.666 --> 10:10.066
And what does
that mean?

10:10.066 --> 10:14.000
Have you even told
Erica what comes next?

10:16.200 --> 10:17.366
She's not ready.

10:17.366 --> 10:20.433
Maybe it's you
who isn't ready.

10:22.300 --> 10:24.333
Who the hell do
you think you are?

10:24.333 --> 10:26.333
I'm just calling
it like I see it.

10:26.333 --> 10:29.166
Well, how about if I
call it like I see it?

10:29.166 --> 10:31.233
You can't help Kai,

10:31.233 --> 10:34.500
and so you're dragging
my patient into your mess.

10:34.500 --> 10:36.766
Or maybe Aesop
was right.

10:36.766 --> 10:39.766
"familiarity
breeds contempt."

10:44.766 --> 10:45.766
(soft chuckle)

10:50.766 --> 10:51.766
Sam!

10:53.500 --> 10:55.600
Oh my god, what
is going on?

10:55.600 --> 10:56.700
I left Josh.

10:56.700 --> 10:58.100
(exhales)

10:58.100 --> 10:59.466
You left Josh?

11:00.466 --> 11:03.733
This morning I just
woke up and...

11:05.133 --> 11:07.700
Bought a ticket
and got on a plane.

11:07.700 --> 11:10.400
Sounds so dramatic.
I just...

11:10.400 --> 11:12.333
I had to leave.

11:12.333 --> 11:13.366
I had to.

11:13.366 --> 11:15.133
And he didn't even
try to stop you?

11:15.133 --> 11:16.100
Josh doesn't know.

11:16.100 --> 11:17.266
(half laughs
in disbelief)

11:17.266 --> 11:19.100
He probably hasn't even
noticed that I'm gone.

11:19.100 --> 11:20.233
It's just...

11:22.100 --> 11:23.000
Oh, god.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.233
Ever since we
moved to London,

11:24.233 --> 11:26.500
he's always
working.

11:26.500 --> 11:30.100
And last night was supposed
to be our night together

11:30.100 --> 11:34.266
and I waited at Claridges
for two hours.

11:34.266 --> 11:36.666
And I got home
and found him...

11:36.666 --> 11:38.266
In front of the tv.

11:39.666 --> 11:40.633
He forgot.

11:40.633 --> 11:41.300
(crying)

11:41.300 --> 11:42.700
Oh, Sammy.

11:45.200 --> 11:47.433
How much more can I
possibly put up with?

11:47.433 --> 11:49.066
I just woke up
this morning

11:49.066 --> 11:51.266
and felt like I
couldn't breathe.

11:51.266 --> 11:53.700
Erica: Shhh, shhh...
Sammy... Sam.

11:54.700 --> 11:56.266
Hey, it's gonna
be okay.

11:58.533 --> 12:01.000
I'm just gonna get
some more of these.

12:07.233 --> 12:09.233
Erica: (relieved sigh)
oh...

12:09.233 --> 12:10.233
Thank god.

12:12.366 --> 12:15.266
Today has been
the worst day.

12:15.266 --> 12:16.733
First of all,
Julianne,

12:16.733 --> 12:18.733
She has a nervous
breakdown in the elevator,

12:18.733 --> 12:20.733
and then Sam follows
suit in my apartment.

12:20.733 --> 12:22.533
And then Dr. Fred,
he somehow thinks

12:22.533 --> 12:24.533
that I can do
his job for him.

12:24.533 --> 12:27.333
And on top it all off, I
am having major anxiety

12:27.333 --> 12:29.333
over Ethan's and my...
Well, our sex life.

12:29.333 --> 12:30.100
Erica.

12:30.100 --> 12:31.166
Yes.

12:31.166 --> 12:32.533
Take a breath.

12:32.533 --> 12:34.733
(inhales and exhales)

12:36.666 --> 12:40.766
Sorry, it's just it's all
getting to be a bit much.

12:40.766 --> 12:42.533
So, where're we
going today?

12:42.533 --> 12:43.566
Spa would be nice.

12:43.566 --> 12:48.100
(chuckles)

12:48.100 --> 12:51.566
Why? Is that how you
see this therapy?

12:51.566 --> 12:54.466
As a vacation
from your life?

12:54.466 --> 12:57.400
No, I was...
I was just joking.

12:57.400 --> 13:00.166
Please, send me
wherever you want.

13:00.166 --> 13:04.300
'cause anywhere is better
than my day today.

13:09.333 --> 13:13.200
You know, Erica,
uh, this office is...

13:13.200 --> 13:14.733
It's not a refuge,
right?

13:14.733 --> 13:17.766
I mean, this is not meant
to be like an escape hatch

13:17.766 --> 13:18.600
(chuckles)

13:18.600 --> 13:19.600
From your life.

13:19.600 --> 13:21.200
No, I know.
You're my therapist,

13:21.200 --> 13:23.600
and I come here
and I tell you my problems

13:23.600 --> 13:25.400
and then...
You help me solve them.

13:25.400 --> 13:27.333
I mean isn't that
the whole point?

13:27.333 --> 13:28.200
No.

13:28.200 --> 13:29.700
No, it's not.

13:30.700 --> 13:33.766
The point, Erica,
is for you, ultimately,

13:33.766 --> 13:36.066
to do all of this
on your own.

13:36.066 --> 13:38.500
And if you honestly see
what we do in here

13:38.500 --> 13:39.700
as the solution,

13:39.700 --> 13:42.633
then... well,
I'm failing.

13:43.633 --> 13:45.133
Dr. Tom...

13:45.133 --> 13:49.500
Think it might be time
to rip away the safety net.

13:49.500 --> 13:53.766
Erica, today you're gonna
solve your problems

13:53.766 --> 13:57.500
like the other 6 billion
souls on this planet:

13:57.500 --> 13:58.333
all on your own.

13:58.333 --> 13:59.033
(stammers)

13:59.033 --> 14:00.466
Uh, d...

14:01.633 --> 14:02.633
(boxes clatter)

14:04.033 --> 14:05.666
Erica, what are
you doing?

14:05.666 --> 14:09.100
Um...

14:09.100 --> 14:10.100
Tissue?

14:11.666 --> 14:14.100

14:28.600 --> 14:30.333
Thank you.

14:30.333 --> 14:33.200
For not rubbing it
in my face.

14:33.200 --> 14:34.600
You were right
all along and...

14:34.600 --> 14:35.433
(sigh of disgust)

14:35.433 --> 14:37.100
I was so
awful to you.

14:37.100 --> 14:38.533
No, Sam,

14:38.533 --> 14:40.766
don't even worry
about that.

14:40.766 --> 14:44.266
Look, I'm just really
proud of you,

14:44.266 --> 14:47.533
and I can't even imagine
how hard this is.

14:47.533 --> 14:49.700
Kai: Next up, a fine
bottle of Gamay.

14:49.700 --> 14:51.566
It's got a cat
on the label,

14:51.566 --> 14:53.366
so you know
it's the good stuff.

14:53.366 --> 14:56.066
Sam and Erica:
(chuckle politely)

14:56.300 --> 14:58.166
Oh, Erica,
you're exhausted.

14:58.166 --> 14:59.100
Mm-mm.

14:59.100 --> 15:00.400
I show up on
your doorstep,

15:00.400 --> 15:02.766
and interrupt your work,
and your romantic evening.

15:02.766 --> 15:05.200
Mm, no romantic
evening.

15:05.200 --> 15:06.533
No?

15:06.533 --> 15:08.400
Okay, you should have seen
what Ethan wasn't wearing

15:08.400 --> 15:10.266
when I showed up.

15:10.266 --> 15:11.233
Really?!

15:11.233 --> 15:12.500
Yeah.

15:13.266 --> 15:16.500
Things have been...
A little awkward between us.

15:16.500 --> 15:18.000
Then you should
go home.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.033
I'm not gonna abandon
you in a bar.

15:20.033 --> 15:22.300
Erica, you have done
enough for me.

15:22.300 --> 15:24.600
If there's something
going on there with Ethan,

15:24.600 --> 15:25.733
go fix it.

15:25.733 --> 15:29.533
No, really, you know,
it's no big thing.

15:29.533 --> 15:32.333
It never is
at the start.

15:32.333 --> 15:35.066
Kai: Hey, part of my
job description's

15:35.066 --> 15:36.133
showing the
broken-hearted

15:36.133 --> 15:39.133
how the goblins staff
likes to party.

15:39.133 --> 15:41.700
I... I don't think
that Sam is in any state

15:41.700 --> 15:43.666
to keep up
with you, Kai.

15:43.666 --> 15:45.333
Sam: Erica,
just go.

15:46.333 --> 15:47.533
And don't
wait up.

15:47.533 --> 15:49.233
I won't.

15:49.233 --> 15:50.033
Thank you.

15:50.033 --> 15:51.033
There you go.

15:51.033 --> 15:52.066
I'll be fine.

15:52.066 --> 15:53.400
Okay.

15:53.400 --> 15:55.066
Call any time.

15:56.066 --> 15:58.300
So what, you don't trust
me with your sister?

16:00.166 --> 16:01.533
Look, it's just...

16:01.533 --> 16:05.133
I mean, Sam, she's really
fragile right now.

16:05.133 --> 16:08.500
Look, just...
Don't let her get drunk,

16:08.500 --> 16:10.333
and keep the
gross guys away.

16:10.333 --> 16:12.100
Just please take
care of her.

16:12.100 --> 16:13.333
She'll be fine.

16:13.333 --> 16:14.600
Really.

16:14.600 --> 16:15.600
Go.

16:17.066 --> 16:19.233
Okay. Good night.
Thank you.

16:19.233 --> 16:20.233
Good night.

16:23.233 --> 16:25.033
(elevator dings open)

16:35.233 --> 16:37.166
Jules.

16:37.166 --> 16:38.400
Thomas.

16:38.400 --> 16:40.266
Please take
a seat.

16:40.466 --> 16:42.500
I kinda feel like
I've been sent down

16:42.500 --> 16:44.433
to the principal's
office.

16:44.433 --> 16:46.300
Like you're gonna pull
out your yardstick

16:46.300 --> 16:48.466
and spank me.

16:49.533 --> 16:52.266
I'm gonna just cut
to the chase.

16:52.266 --> 16:54.733
I think we both know
that we work well together.

16:54.733 --> 16:56.666
As lovers?

16:56.666 --> 16:58.600
But the past
is the past

16:58.600 --> 17:01.333
and I am willing
to move on.

17:01.333 --> 17:03.366
Focus, as you would
say, on the now.

17:03.366 --> 17:06.700
Mm, so, we just pretend
like it never happened?

17:06.700 --> 17:09.133
We pretend like you
didn't rip my balls off

17:09.133 --> 17:10.766
in front of your
entire staff?

17:10.766 --> 17:13.466
Yes, and we pretend you
didn't go behind my back,

17:13.466 --> 17:15.466
like a weasel,
to Scott Galvin.

17:15.466 --> 17:17.099
Not to mention
Meeri.

17:17.099 --> 17:18.099
And that's it?

17:18.099 --> 17:19.099
That's it.

17:20.633 --> 17:21.633
Deal.

17:25.466 --> 17:27.033
Oh.

17:27.033 --> 17:29.466
Provided I get
one thing.

17:29.466 --> 17:31.466
What's that,
your typeface?

17:31.466 --> 17:32.666
No.

17:32.666 --> 17:35.400
I want an apology
from you.

17:36.400 --> 17:37.200
For what?

17:37.200 --> 17:39.266
For disrespecting me,

17:39.266 --> 17:41.333
for wounding
my male pride.

17:41.333 --> 17:43.433
Hell, just for
the fun of it.

17:43.433 --> 17:45.633
And I want you to
beg for forgiveness

17:45.633 --> 17:48.300
in front of everyone.

17:48.300 --> 17:50.400
You show me the
respect I deserve,

17:50.400 --> 17:52.466
and you can keep
riding my coattails.

17:52.466 --> 17:53.166
Don't,

17:53.166 --> 17:54.100
(inhales)

17:54.100 --> 17:56.400
and some other
vampire will.

18:09.466 --> 18:10.466
Hey.

18:10.466 --> 18:11.400
Hey. I, uh,

18:11.400 --> 18:13.133
I made up the
couch for Sam.

18:13.133 --> 18:14.133
Oh, thank you.

18:15.233 --> 18:17.000
So, how is she?

18:17.000 --> 18:18.666
You know what,
she's...

18:18.666 --> 18:20.000
Better.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.233
All things considered.

18:22.233 --> 18:23.533
So...

18:23.533 --> 18:25.533
Sam said she found
you half-naked,

18:25.533 --> 18:27.066
lighting candles.

18:27.066 --> 18:29.133
Well, if your sister wasn't
having a marital crisis,

18:29.133 --> 18:31.733
you could've spent the evening
with me as your slave.

18:33.166 --> 18:34.166
Really?

18:38.166 --> 18:40.566
Is that what
you'd like?

18:40.566 --> 18:43.166
Oh, um, if you would.
I mean, sure.

18:43.166 --> 18:45.200
We could take out
a bottle of wine

18:45.200 --> 18:47.333
and have a bath.

18:47.333 --> 18:49.066
We could, or...

18:51.300 --> 18:52.300
(exhales)

18:54.566 --> 18:56.566
You could
show me.

18:59.700 --> 19:00.433
(uncomfortable)

19:00.433 --> 19:01.300
No.

19:01.300 --> 19:02.433
Why?

19:02.433 --> 19:05.033
Because that would
just be weird.

19:05.033 --> 19:08.133
Or it could be
really hot, Ethan.

19:09.133 --> 19:10.133
Please?

19:11.733 --> 19:13.200
Please?

we think we're supposed to,

30:30.400 --> 30:32.733

we really want to.

30:32.733 --> 30:34.166

30:34.166 --> 30:36.066
I don't... I don't know
what you're talking about.

30:36.066 --> 30:37.100

back, Ethan.

let yourself go,

30:47.700 --> 30:49.266

30:49.266 --> 30:50.466
and, and I want to.

30:50.466 --> 30:53.266

get out of your head

30:53.266 --> 30:55.266

whatever you wanna do.

30:55.266 --> 30:57.066

be a man!

31:28.566 --> 31:31.200
You have experience
with women, right?

31:31.200 --> 31:32.166
I do.

31:32.166 --> 31:34.000
Do you ever just...

31:34.000 --> 31:36.300
Go after what
you want?

31:38.300 --> 31:39.766
Erica, that's not
how it was.

31:39.766 --> 31:42.500
I mean,
it wasn't just me.

31:43.566 --> 31:46.766
Sam wanted it too.
She initiated.

31:47.600 --> 31:50.733
Wow, here I am asking
you for advice

31:50.733 --> 31:52.633
about my
boyfriend and...

31:52.633 --> 31:55.000
You haven't
changed at all.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.300
What does
that mean?

31:56.300 --> 31:57.066
(half laughs)

31:57.066 --> 31:58.400
I'm such an idiot.

31:58.400 --> 32:00.666
I was willing to give you
the benefit of the doubt,

32:00.666 --> 32:02.266
but you're still
the same guy

32:02.266 --> 32:04.100
you will be 10
years from now.

32:04.100 --> 32:05.566
Of course,
Fred told you.

32:05.566 --> 32:08.700
No, he sent me there,
to 2019, to see you.

32:08.700 --> 32:10.000
And you
know what?

32:10.000 --> 32:11.200
You're still
the same selfish,

32:11.200 --> 32:12.633
inconsiderate
asshole!

32:12.633 --> 32:13.633
Erica!

32:17.466 --> 32:19.066
Scott:
Giacomelli.

32:19.733 --> 32:20.733
What's the word?

32:20.733 --> 32:23.400
The word is "gold."
Pure gold.

32:24.433 --> 32:26.666
It's our next
bestseller.

32:26.666 --> 32:28.633
The author is this
fresh new voice.

32:28.633 --> 32:30.233
She's a pagan
shaman

32:30.233 --> 32:31.400
from Nowheresville,
Saskatchewan,

32:31.400 --> 32:33.633
who has uncovered
the true secret of now.

32:33.633 --> 32:35.433
I'm talking past lives,

32:35.433 --> 32:38.066
celestial messages,
spirit animals.

32:38.066 --> 32:39.066
Beauty.

32:39.066 --> 32:40.366
Maybe we can publish
it concurrently

32:40.366 --> 32:42.366
with Friedken's book.

32:42.366 --> 32:44.366
Well, that's the thing,
we don't need Friedken.

32:44.366 --> 32:46.766
We can get her for one
quarter of the price.

32:46.766 --> 32:47.766
Whoa, back it up.

32:47.766 --> 32:48.700
(inhales and exhales)

32:48.700 --> 32:51.366
You talked to
Friedken, yes?

32:51.366 --> 32:53.233
Yes.

32:53.233 --> 32:54.233
And?

32:55.733 --> 32:58.666
And I can't, in
good conscience,

32:58.666 --> 33:01.100
do what he wants
me to do

33:01.100 --> 33:02.533
to make
him happy.

33:03.533 --> 33:05.366
(exhales)

33:05.366 --> 33:07.466
Okay, listen up.

33:07.466 --> 33:09.400
We're not gonna
lose Friedken.

33:09.400 --> 33:11.500
He's not
replaceable.

33:11.500 --> 33:12.733
You are.

33:12.733 --> 33:14.033
Scott.

33:14.033 --> 33:16.333
So, if you wanna keep
my father happy,

33:16.333 --> 33:18.500
if you wanna
keep your job,

33:18.500 --> 33:21.100
you keep
Friedken happy.

33:23.266 --> 33:25.666
You know, my dad told me
that you were slipping;

33:25.666 --> 33:27.466
that your staff
is starting to talk.

33:27.466 --> 33:28.666
I didn't believe it,
but...

33:28.666 --> 33:30.166
(inhales and exhales)

33:30.166 --> 33:32.133
Looks like he's right.

33:33.133 --> 33:34.133
Okay.

33:35.700 --> 33:37.433
(incredulous sigh)

33:37.433 --> 33:39.433
Erica: For the sake of
the sex book,

33:39.433 --> 33:42.166
on average, how
many times a day?

33:42.166 --> 33:43.200
Six to eight.

33:43.200 --> 33:44.566
What?

33:44.566 --> 33:45.233
Mm.

33:46.033 --> 33:48.200
So sorry to
just drop in.

33:48.200 --> 33:49.366
That's okay,

33:49.366 --> 33:52.000
you seem to be doing
a lot of that these days.

33:53.433 --> 33:55.566
Well, hitting the
midday doldrums;

33:55.566 --> 33:57.333
time for a
caffeine fix.

33:57.333 --> 33:58.700
What's this?

33:58.700 --> 34:01.466
This is to thank you
for everything.

34:02.466 --> 34:03.700
Josh came
to get me

34:03.700 --> 34:05.700
and we're going back
to London...

34:05.700 --> 34:08.300
To give it
another shot.

34:08.699 --> 34:10.366
Look, I know what
you're thinking.

34:10.366 --> 34:14.166
Good. then I don't
have to say anything.

34:14.166 --> 34:15.633
I made a mistake -

34:15.633 --> 34:18.033
getting on that plane,
running out on Josh.

34:18.033 --> 34:20.166
Having sex
with Kai.

34:21.033 --> 34:23.033
Look, Sammy, how...

34:23.033 --> 34:25.466
How's this gonna
change anything?

34:25.466 --> 34:27.633
Josh promises
he's gonna try.

34:27.633 --> 34:29.066
Okay, and if
he doesn't?

34:29.066 --> 34:31.333
What, are you just gonna
jump on another plane,

34:31.333 --> 34:32.600
go find another Kai?

34:32.600 --> 34:33.600
Erica.

34:33.600 --> 34:36.199
Sam, please, just...

34:36.199 --> 34:39.066
For once, listen
to your gut.

34:39.066 --> 34:40.133
Listen to
your heart

34:40.133 --> 34:44.333
because they are all
telling you to stop.

34:44.333 --> 34:46.333
Let go of
the fantasy.

34:47.333 --> 34:48.600
Julianne: (intercom)
Important editorial meeting

34:48.600 --> 34:50.199
in the board
room in five.

34:51.699 --> 34:53.766
You seem
really busy...

34:53.766 --> 34:55.333
And my flight.

34:56.333 --> 34:57.333
So...

34:59.166 --> 35:00.333
Bye.

35:00.333 --> 35:01.333
Bye, Sam.

35:05.466 --> 35:06.466
(defeated sigh)

35:07.566 --> 35:09.700
Well, thank you
all for coming.

35:10.733 --> 35:13.000
I stand here
in front of you,

35:14.000 --> 35:17.600
ashamed of my conduct
in the past few months,

35:19.066 --> 35:22.766
of having let you all down
by virtue of being very...

35:22.766 --> 35:24.466
Very unprofessional.

35:25.333 --> 35:26.100
Um...

35:26.100 --> 35:26.600
(clears throat)

35:26.600 --> 35:28.300
Most of all,

35:28.300 --> 35:31.500
I have to apologize
to Thomas Friedken,

35:33.000 --> 35:37.200
the most valuable author
River Rock has ever known.

35:37.200 --> 35:39.500
A brilliant talent,

35:39.500 --> 35:42.366
who, who deserves to be treated
with much more respect

35:42.366 --> 35:43.766
than I have shown.

35:49.066 --> 35:49.566
Um...

35:49.566 --> 35:51.266
(clears throat)

35:51.266 --> 35:55.700
Allow me to quote from his
upcoming manuscript,

35:55.700 --> 35:58.033
"The Mystery
of Tomorrow."

35:59.533 --> 36:01.466
(flat, sarcastic,
half laugh)

36:01.466 --> 36:05.666
"When we recognize genius,
we increase our own power."

36:19.600 --> 36:20.666
(keys jingle)

36:31.766 --> 36:35.700
Erica: What? So now
you're not talking to me?

36:35.700 --> 36:37.500
That's great.

36:37.500 --> 36:39.200
You know what?
That's fine.

36:39.200 --> 36:42.266
Talking doesn't seem to be
getting us anywhere, so...

36:42.266 --> 36:43.266
Hey.

36:45.433 --> 36:50.533
Okay, sorry,
not interested.

36:50.533 --> 36:55.766

Julianne:
Do you mind?

37:37.100 --> 37:38.400
Not at all.

37:43.233 --> 37:45.266
So what do
you want?

37:45.266 --> 37:47.633
Wanted to give
you these.

37:47.633 --> 37:52.300
First three chapters of
"The Mystery of Tomorrow."

37:52.300 --> 37:54.400
Oh, you could've
emailed them.

37:54.400 --> 37:57.166
But thank you, I'll

37:57.166 --> 37:58.766
Yeah, hmm...

37:58.766 --> 38:01.200
I wanted to talk to
you about that.

38:01.200 --> 38:05.033
Uh, I'm not sure you're
cut out for this title.

38:05.033 --> 38:06.233
What are you
talking about?

38:06.233 --> 38:08.433
You're keeping the book
here at River Rock.

38:08.433 --> 38:12.466
Yes, but... doesn't mean
it has to be with you.

38:12.466 --> 38:13.700
Friedken.

38:43.333 --> 38:44.333
Hey.

38:44.333 --> 38:47.033
I hope we don't
miss our flight.

38:49.500 --> 38:53.066
I just booked us a
whole week at a spa.

38:53.066 --> 38:54.300
Really?

38:54.300 --> 38:56.266
Yeah, you can spend all day
getting your pedicures

38:56.266 --> 38:57.766
and your manicures
and your facial-whatevers.

38:57.766 --> 39:00.300
I'll be on the
golf course.

39:00.300 --> 39:02.266
But we'll see each
other in the evenings.

39:02.266 --> 39:04.466
And Maurice and his wife
Grace will be there,

39:04.466 --> 39:07.066
so we can have
dinner with them.

39:07.066 --> 39:08.600
Your boss is
gonna be there?

39:08.600 --> 39:09.566
Mm-hmm.

39:11.166 --> 39:14.033
So, this is a
business trip?

39:15.066 --> 39:18.300
Yeah, it's a business trip
and, uh, an escape for us.

39:18.300 --> 39:20.200
With your boss
and his wife.

39:20.200 --> 39:22.166
Sam, I'm doing something
good here.

39:22.166 --> 39:25.700
No, you're doing
something convenient.

39:27.366 --> 39:28.766
Why do you wanna
be together?

39:28.766 --> 39:32.100
Jesus.
I told you.

39:32.100 --> 39:33.433
I love you,
we're married.

39:33.433 --> 39:36.133
But why?
Why do you love me?

39:36.133 --> 39:38.100
Why did you want
to marry me?

39:38.100 --> 39:39.100
Sam.

39:40.300 --> 39:41.500
Just get in the car.

39:41.500 --> 39:42.600
No.

39:42.600 --> 39:43.600
Tell me.

39:44.600 --> 39:47.200
Unless you don't
know why.

39:48.200 --> 39:49.666
I-I love you.

39:51.100 --> 39:52.500
I-I don't know,
I don't know...

39:52.500 --> 39:54.100
I just do.

39:55.000 --> 39:56.000
Really?

39:57.100 --> 39:59.100
'cause most of the
time I feel like...

39:59.100 --> 40:00.733
You don't even
like me.

40:00.733 --> 40:02.000
Sam.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.433
There's a difference
between what you say

40:04.433 --> 40:08.133
and what is actually
happening between us.

40:09.133 --> 40:11.666
We can't keep
ignoring it.

40:13.266 --> 40:15.266
We need to
take a break.

40:15.266 --> 40:17.766
I need some
time to think.

40:18.766 --> 40:21.766
I-I'm not leaving
without you.

40:27.266 --> 40:28.266
Sam...

40:29.733 --> 40:30.733
Sam!

40:40.666 --> 40:42.333
Ah, sushi, great.

40:45.333 --> 40:47.066
So?

40:47.066 --> 40:48.100
How do you feel?

40:48.100 --> 40:49.166
Fine. hungry.

40:50.166 --> 40:51.566
Yeah, I bet.

40:56.533 --> 40:59.133
Am I such a girl for
wanting talk about it?

40:59.133 --> 41:00.066
(stammers)

41:00.066 --> 41:02.100
What's there to
talk about?

41:02.100 --> 41:05.333
Ethan, I thought
it was incredible.

41:06.333 --> 41:08.266
Well, that's great.

41:09.266 --> 41:11.033
What did
you think?

41:11.033 --> 41:11.566
It was fun.

41:11.566 --> 41:12.266
(laughs)

41:12.266 --> 41:13.433
Ethan.

41:13.433 --> 41:15.033
What, we're about
to have dinner.

41:15.033 --> 41:18.100
I don't wanna deconstruct
the sex we just had.

41:18.100 --> 41:21.200
Can we talk about
something else?

41:21.200 --> 41:22.300
What, did you...

41:22.300 --> 41:24.766
I mean, did you
not like it?

41:24.766 --> 41:27.633
I... I liked it.

41:27.633 --> 41:30.433
Are you sure? Because your face
is saying that you didn't

41:30.733 --> 41:32.733
can you just
drop it, please?

41:36.733 --> 41:39.600
It's not me, okay?
Being like that.

41:39.600 --> 41:42.466
I just, I liked our sex
life the way it was.

41:45.600 --> 41:46.600
Oh.

41:47.633 --> 41:48.633
You're upset.

41:48.633 --> 41:49.766
No.

41:49.766 --> 41:51.666
No, I mean if you don't
feel comfortable,

41:51.666 --> 41:53.666
then we shouldn't.

41:57.433 --> 42:00.433
Do you want the spicy tuna
roll or can I have it?

42:00.433 --> 42:02.566
Hey, it's all yours.

42:04.400 --> 42:08.366
Erica: Most of us think we
know ourselves pretty well -

42:08.366 --> 42:13.400
our hopes,
dreams, desires.

42:13.400 --> 42:14.566
We cling
so tightly

42:14.566 --> 42:16.633

we tell ourselves,
