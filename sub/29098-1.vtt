00:38.206 --> 00:41.789
Man needs to love
the world some more.

00:44.700 --> 00:47.418
Because the earth,
the wind, you know,

00:47.420 --> 00:51.133
the water, it's all
gonna fade away.

00:53.341 --> 00:55.037
It's coming, man.

01:02.269 --> 01:05.853
I mean, your average
Joe on the street now

01:06.781 --> 01:10.588
he doesn't care about
the environment, okay,

01:10.590 --> 01:12.508
or pollution.

01:12.510 --> 01:15.806
I mean, your politicians,
they're printing.

01:16.607 --> 01:19.548
George, you know,
on the dollar bill.

01:19.550 --> 01:24.060
Man, they've got the
pyramid, man, you know?

01:24.062 --> 01:26.461
- You know, the eye.
- Yeah, the eye.

01:26.463 --> 01:27.645
The eye of Horus, man.

01:28.254 --> 01:31.965
The all-seeing thing, you
know, it's on the bill.

01:31.967 --> 01:32.796
You know?

01:32.798 --> 01:34.079
And this is like they're saying,

01:34.910 --> 01:38.556
this is new God,
worship this, man, yeah.

01:38.558 --> 01:40.062
Worship the money, you know.

01:40.830 --> 01:41.726
You know?

01:42.847 --> 01:44.287
But it doesn't exist.

01:45.982 --> 01:47.294
It doesn't exist, you know?

01:48.479 --> 01:51.710
The world, she's gonna die.

01:53.279 --> 01:54.942
Do we exist?

01:56.542 --> 02:00.029
We are beyond existence.

02:02.879 --> 02:06.847
<i>I stand amid the
roar of a surf-tormented shore</i>

02:07.615 --> 02:12.511
<i>and I hold within my hand
grains of the golden sand.</i>

02:13.119 --> 02:16.253
<i>How few, yet how
they creep through</i>

02:16.255 --> 02:19.647
<i>my fingers to the
deep while I weep.</i>

02:20.447 --> 02:22.077
<i>While I weep.</i>

02:22.079 --> 02:26.237
<i>Oh God, can I not grasp
them with a tighter clasp?</i>

02:26.239 --> 02:30.015
<i>Oh God, can I not save one
from the pitiless wave?</i>

02:30.528 --> 02:35.903
<i>Is all that we see or seem
but a dream within a dream?</i>

02:51.041 --> 02:51.776
Jay!

03:39.809 --> 03:42.784
- Please, please!
- Don't move.

03:42.786 --> 03:44.191
Please, please!

03:44.193 --> 03:46.879
I have no
mercy for you, bitch!

03:46.881 --> 03:48.354
Please!

03:52.194 --> 03:54.114
You can stop.

03:55.585 --> 03:57.505
You already killed me.

03:59.842 --> 04:01.474
Who the fuck
do you think you are?

04:03.105 --> 04:04.962
I am the devil.

04:05.826 --> 04:08.386
And I'm here to do
the devil's business.

04:10.690 --> 04:13.026
Fuck, fuck!

04:14.146 --> 04:15.424
Fucker!

04:22.818 --> 04:24.290
You're a fucker!

04:25.154 --> 04:26.434
Motherfucker!

04:43.971 --> 04:45.953
<i>Persons,

The reason I started
using drugs was a simple one.

06:14.213 --> 06:17.860
I, uh, couldn't deal with
the world I was presented.

06:19.076 --> 06:22.499
Or, to
be more specific,

06:22.501 --> 06:24.964
I couldn't deal with how I felt

06:24.966 --> 06:26.500
about the world I was presented.

06:27.686 --> 06:30.147
I think when we come
into the world we're told

06:30.149 --> 06:33.508
this is how it works
and this is what you do.

06:33.510 --> 06:34.788
And, uh...

06:37.030 --> 06:38.626
I guess I couldn't
make sense of that.

06:38.628 --> 06:42.150
I just felt different than
everyone else, more sensitive.

06:43.814 --> 06:44.645
Um...

06:46.854 --> 06:52.102
So, I did whatever I could
to suppress my emotions.

06:53.125 --> 06:54.918
My drug of choice was heroin.

06:59.494 --> 07:01.285
Now that I'm clean
and sober I'm learning

07:01.287 --> 07:03.622
to touch my emotions
in a healthy way.

07:06.183 --> 07:10.309
So yeah, if I keep doing
this, then I'll be okay.

07:11.878 --> 07:14.052
And, if not, then
I'll just be clinging

07:14.054 --> 07:15.142
to that roller coaster,

07:16.263 --> 07:18.150
hoping I don't fly
off the handle.

07:20.326 --> 07:24.743
But yeah, six months
today, so... thanks.

07:26.086 --> 07:27.879
- Good job.
- Thanks.

07:30.630 --> 07:35.364
So, you all moved in
up on Cielo Drive?

07:35.366 --> 07:36.390
Yeah.

07:37.542 --> 07:39.206
Freaked out yet?

07:39.848 --> 07:41.030
Not yet.

07:42.568 --> 07:44.229
Do you think it's
such a good idea

07:44.231 --> 07:46.439
to live in a place
with such dark history?

07:47.143 --> 07:48.743
I'm working the steps.

07:50.439 --> 07:51.717
I'm in a good place.

07:51.719 --> 07:54.310
Yeah, but the first
year of recovery

07:54.312 --> 07:57.032
is a particularly fragile time.

07:58.504 --> 07:59.910
If you put yourself
in a position where

07:59.912 --> 08:02.469
you're surrounded with
a lot of dark energy,

08:02.471 --> 08:03.815
you could get affected by it.

08:04.936 --> 08:07.623
Come on, Ann, that's not
the big book talking.

08:09.991 --> 08:12.902
Okay, I admit, I have
a passing interest

08:12.904 --> 08:14.471
in the supernatural.

08:14.473 --> 08:16.294
But it doesn't bother you?

08:16.296 --> 08:18.216
Living in a place where
so many people died?

08:19.048 --> 08:20.645
We live in a
country that's built

08:20.647 --> 08:22.886
on the deaths of countless
Native Americans.

08:22.888 --> 08:24.549
You could throw a
stone and land on

08:24.551 --> 08:26.440
an ancient Indian burial ground.

08:34.217 --> 08:37.193
You know, I've seen it
all moving around, man.

08:37.576 --> 08:39.113
God does not exist!

08:40.585 --> 08:41.864
I'm the devil!

08:44.425 --> 08:45.641
But I'm no one.

08:46.601 --> 08:48.392
<i>I'm the universe, man.</i>

08:50.312 --> 08:51.657
<i>I'm in my mind.</i>

08:53.930 --> 08:56.072
<i>The mind is everything, man.</i>

08:56.681 --> 08:59.338
<i>It moves and it flows.</i>

09:00.521 --> 09:02.154
<i>It flows like water.</i>

09:02.952 --> 09:04.518
<i>It was the whole world.</i>

09:04.520 --> 09:08.616
<i>It was moving and converging
to one point of time.</i>

09:10.280 --> 09:12.520
<i>It was an altar, that's
what it was, man.</i>

09:12.522 --> 09:14.888
Shit!

09:14.890 --> 09:16.266
<i>It was an altar.</i>

09:17.257 --> 09:20.202
The world was
changing and moving.

10:12.556 --> 10:16.648
So, what's the main inspiration

10:16.650 --> 10:18.602
behind the new album then, eh?

10:19.915 --> 10:21.835
Oh, hold on.

10:24.011 --> 10:25.416
Hello?

10:25.418 --> 10:27.593
Is that Charlie Manson?

10:27.595 --> 10:30.411
Yes, yes, it is, she's here.

10:30.986 --> 10:33.289
Yes, she's very
interested and she wants

10:33.291 --> 10:36.489
to know all about the
apocalyptic messages

10:36.491 --> 10:39.500
in your songs so she can
write her next album.

10:39.755 --> 10:41.225
You know, if you read
a book once in a while

10:41.227 --> 10:42.889
you would know
that quite a number

10:42.891 --> 10:45.067
of people dispute the
Helter Skelter motive.

10:45.900 --> 10:48.233
Oh, I'm very well-read,
I'll have you know.

10:48.235 --> 10:51.404
Yeah, nudie mags and cereal
boxes don't count, really.

10:52.107 --> 10:55.499
Some of my best
songs were written

10:55.501 --> 10:58.986
and inspired by nudie
mags and cereal packets.

10:58.988 --> 11:00.396
Well, I am shocked.

11:01.165 --> 11:02.475
But I'm with you, I'm with you.

11:02.477 --> 11:04.076
Are we going for it?

11:05.228 --> 11:07.050
Well, the whole
"rich people must die

11:07.052 --> 11:10.026
because the lyrics warned
of a race war" thing

11:10.028 --> 11:13.962
doesn't really fly with me,
so I'm gonna do some research.

11:13.964 --> 11:15.563
Hold on.

11:15.565 --> 11:17.450
I've gotta have a wizz, alright?

11:17.452 --> 11:20.811
I should be back in
two shakes of my snake.

11:20.813 --> 11:21.804
Hopefully.

11:31.341 --> 11:33.901
I sense a
great sadness in you.

11:34.540 --> 11:36.076
Uh, excuse me?

11:36.078 --> 11:39.851
Sorry, I didn't mean to be rude.

11:39.853 --> 11:41.004
My name's Annabelle.

11:41.933 --> 11:44.141
I sense you have questions.

11:45.197 --> 11:47.275
Are you psychic or something?

11:47.277 --> 11:50.765
You could say I see
beyond the physical realm.

11:53.933 --> 11:57.195
Um, look, my friend's gonna
be back in a minute, so...

11:57.197 --> 12:01.805
I'm sorry, I understand if
you'd prefer to be left alone.

12:02.349 --> 12:03.405
Thank you.

12:04.653 --> 12:06.925
Can I just leave
you with one thing?

12:08.429 --> 12:09.261
What?

12:11.566 --> 12:12.909
It wasn't a dream.

12:31.374 --> 12:32.813
<i>And a large force of more</i>

12:32.815 --> 12:34.796
<i>than 8,000 men today
tightened its hold</i>

12:34.798 --> 12:38.156
<i>on the Bataan Peninsula on
South Vietnam's central coast,</i>

12:38.158 --> 12:39.820
<i>trapping an
undetermined number of...</i>

12:39.822 --> 12:43.438
Crowe, man, what is happening?

12:45.390 --> 12:46.861
Take a seat.

12:46.863 --> 12:49.260
Hey, Rosina, get these
guys a drink will ya?

12:49.262 --> 12:50.190
Sure.

12:54.479 --> 12:58.125
So, you got some business
you wanna throw my way?

12:58.127 --> 13:00.748
I got a guy who wants
to shift 10 keys.

13:00.750 --> 13:01.773
What's this cat's name?

13:02.927 --> 13:05.260
Come on, man, I
can't tell you that.

13:05.262 --> 13:08.173
He's a friend of mine who
just got into this shit.

13:08.175 --> 13:09.517
He ain't no dealer.

13:09.519 --> 13:11.980
He's all panicked, wants
to move the stuff quick.

13:11.982 --> 13:14.477
How did he just
get into this shit?

13:14.479 --> 13:16.780
Look, he's a friend
of mine from Texas.

13:16.782 --> 13:20.557
He hooked up with this whore
who scammed her pimp back home.

13:20.559 --> 13:22.125
She stole the 10 keys.

13:22.127 --> 13:23.981
He rang me up all
panicked so I told him

13:23.983 --> 13:27.823
to come to L.A. and I'll
take it off his hands.

13:28.527 --> 13:29.424
Where is he now?

13:30.064 --> 13:32.974
I set him up in a
place on Coconut Grove.

13:32.976 --> 13:35.054
He don't wanna know anything
about who's buying it.

13:35.056 --> 13:36.686
He just wants me to
give him the money

13:36.688 --> 13:39.214
so he can get the
fuck outta Dodge.

13:39.984 --> 13:42.160
Okay, so why you
telling us this?

13:46.128 --> 13:48.526
'Cause I ain't got the money.

13:49.872 --> 13:53.742
Wait, so you want me
to put up my money

13:53.744 --> 13:56.368
so you can go buy 10
keys off of your friend?

13:59.057 --> 14:00.017
About right.

14:00.656 --> 14:02.255
You don't want a piece
of the action of this?

14:03.088 --> 14:05.648
Look, man, I'm just
the middle man.

14:06.928 --> 14:08.112
You give me the money,

14:08.721 --> 14:11.888
I go pay this guy and
I give you the 10 keys.

14:12.752 --> 14:14.896
I just wanna
help the guy out.

14:16.881 --> 14:19.025
Well, aren't you the
good fucking Samaritan?

14:24.144 --> 14:25.296
Thanks, baby.

14:34.896 --> 14:39.569
Well, if it's as easy as you
say it is, I'm interested.

14:42.066 --> 14:44.018
But let me fly
straight with you.

14:44.689 --> 14:46.672
I don't trust you honkies.

14:48.082 --> 14:49.936
Especially not some
honky motherfuckers

14:49.938 --> 14:52.785
be out here in the
desert ripping off cars.

14:53.842 --> 14:55.089
I smell a rat.

14:55.889 --> 14:56.816
You smell a rat?

14:56.818 --> 14:58.833
A big old white rat.

15:03.634 --> 15:08.911
Well, look, if
you got the money,

15:08.913 --> 15:11.954
we can go over there
right now, get it done.

15:12.882 --> 15:14.290
It'll take five minutes.

15:15.762 --> 15:20.337
I'm offering you the most easy
deal you've ever done, man.

15:25.459 --> 15:28.018
Okay, honky, I'll play ball.

15:29.299 --> 15:30.896
But if something don't sit right

15:30.898 --> 15:32.497
with me when we
get there, I walk.

15:33.330 --> 15:36.787
My man right here, he'll make
sure that you never do again.

15:38.322 --> 15:39.282
Can you dig it?

15:41.939 --> 15:43.474
Yeah, I dig it.

15:52.851 --> 15:54.931
Okay, okay, hang on, hang on.

15:55.284 --> 15:56.496
What?

15:56.498 --> 15:57.809
I told you, this
guy don't wanna know

15:57.811 --> 15:59.696
anything about who's
buying this shit.

15:59.698 --> 16:01.042
Are you fucking kidding me?

16:01.044 --> 16:03.858
Look, this guy ain't
from our world, man.

16:03.860 --> 16:06.450
The less he knows
about you, the better.

16:06.452 --> 16:08.785
It's a wise move not
to show him your face.

16:08.787 --> 16:10.386
You want us to wait out here

16:10.388 --> 16:12.306
while you go inside
there with my money?

16:12.308 --> 16:14.418
I'll be back in five minutes.

16:14.420 --> 16:16.692
If I ain't, knock the door, huh?

16:19.028 --> 16:21.394
- I got a better idea.
- Yeah?

16:21.396 --> 16:25.682
Your girl here's gonna stay
with us 'til you get back.

16:25.684 --> 16:28.818
You don't come back, or
something don't sit right,

16:28.820 --> 16:30.578
this pretty little thing,

16:30.580 --> 16:32.243
she ain't gonna be
so pretty no more.

16:32.468 --> 16:34.353
No, Tex, don't leave me here!

16:34.355 --> 16:35.794
It's fine, baby.

16:35.796 --> 16:37.396
Crowe, man, that's no problem.

16:38.868 --> 16:40.786
I'll be five minutes, baby.

16:40.788 --> 16:42.739
There's nothing to
worry about here.

16:43.668 --> 16:46.226
Well, for her sake...

16:46.228 --> 16:49.171
there better not be, white boy.

16:50.131 --> 16:51.219
It's fine, baby.

16:52.308 --> 16:54.036
I'll be back in five minutes.

17:12.628 --> 17:13.234
Yeah?

17:13.237 --> 17:14.292
That Charles?

17:15.156 --> 17:17.106
This is Charles.

17:17.108 --> 17:19.508
That dope-dealing
motherfucker from Texas?

17:19.510 --> 17:23.666
No, man, this is
the other Charlie.

17:23.669 --> 17:25.042
Where's Tex at?

17:25.045 --> 17:26.165
I ain't seen him.

17:27.094 --> 17:30.291
Okay, well, his problem
becomes your problem.

17:30.293 --> 17:31.126
Listen to this.

17:37.205 --> 17:41.619
Man, that girl don't sound
like she's having a good time.

17:41.621 --> 17:44.372
Oh, she is having
far from a good time.

17:44.374 --> 17:45.716
And it ain't gonna
get any better,

17:45.718 --> 17:47.190
you hippie piece of shit.

17:47.542 --> 17:49.525
What you want me to do about it?

17:49.527 --> 17:51.894
Listen, I want my fucking money!

17:52.533 --> 17:53.972
Alright?

17:53.974 --> 17:55.923
Or I'm gonna come up to
that ranch and kill you

17:55.925 --> 17:58.547
and every other hippie
jive talkin' motherfucker.

17:58.549 --> 17:59.956
You understand me?

17:59.958 --> 18:02.580
I don't know nothin'
about this, okay?

18:02.582 --> 18:05.718
But here's what we're gonna do.

18:06.295 --> 18:09.270
You and I, we'll
resolve this thing.

18:11.703 --> 18:12.630
That's wonderful.

18:13.430 --> 18:18.518
6933 Franklin Avenue,
you've got an hour.

18:19.254 --> 18:20.087
Motherfucker!

18:29.719 --> 18:32.661
Oh yeah, he got
the girl over here.

18:32.663 --> 18:33.399
That's cool.

18:34.135 --> 18:36.726
Hey, man, you know, yeah.

18:38.678 --> 18:40.534
That's a real nice shirt.

18:41.719 --> 18:43.349
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

18:43.351 --> 18:44.663
You are welcome!

18:47.095 --> 18:48.278
Hi, honey.

18:49.431 --> 18:51.318
I'm here, I'm here.

18:51.320 --> 18:52.949
I'm here, look at me.

18:52.951 --> 18:54.581
Look at me, just look at me.

18:54.583 --> 18:56.374
I'm here, okay?

18:56.376 --> 18:58.421
Okay, I'm here and I love you.

18:58.423 --> 19:00.373
I'm just gonna untie
this girl here...

19:00.375 --> 19:01.461
What the fuck you doin'?

19:01.463 --> 19:03.063
I'm here to have a
meeting, you know.

19:03.927 --> 19:05.014
Get out of my way.

19:05.016 --> 19:06.678
So, what I want you to do.

19:06.680 --> 19:08.629
Just take that, take it, okay.

19:08.631 --> 19:10.902
What I want you to
do now is I want you

19:10.904 --> 19:13.974
to get that cute little
ass of yours, okay.

19:13.976 --> 19:15.830
Okay, yeah, yeah, okay?

19:15.832 --> 19:18.902
Run along to the kitchen and
just make us some coffee.

19:18.904 --> 19:22.007
Just get out of here, okay?

19:23.544 --> 19:27.414
Okay, yeah, well,
wow, look at that.

19:27.416 --> 19:28.599
Wow, what a view you've got.

19:29.624 --> 19:33.590
You're the man, the guy I
was talking to on the phone?

19:33.592 --> 19:34.614
Nice gentleman.

19:34.616 --> 19:35.608
No, he'll be right in.

19:35.928 --> 19:40.278
Oh, yeah, you gotta
wait for him, huh?

19:40.280 --> 19:42.968
I bet he's always making
you do that small shit.

19:46.168 --> 19:49.175
Oh yeah, I kind of
thought you were the boss.

19:49.177 --> 19:52.311
That's what I naturally
assumed, you know?

19:52.313 --> 19:54.454
- I mean, look at the...
- Hey, man!

19:54.456 --> 19:56.406
What the fuck is she doing up
and walking around, nigger?

19:56.408 --> 19:57.687
I told you to keep
that bitch tied!

19:57.689 --> 19:59.318
Sit on down.

19:59.320 --> 20:00.278
Oh, you.

20:00.280 --> 20:01.527
Yeah.

20:01.529 --> 20:02.903
You fucking wise-ass
motherfucker!

20:02.905 --> 20:03.769
You got my money?

20:04.281 --> 20:05.591
Whoo-wee-wee-wee!

20:05.593 --> 20:08.087
Wee-wee-wee, five
grand, motherfucker!

20:08.089 --> 20:10.457
That's a lot of
beans, motherfucker!

20:11.353 --> 20:13.655
I want my fucking money today!

20:13.657 --> 20:15.063
Uh-huh.

20:15.065 --> 20:16.247
Or I'm gonna ice this
little bitch of yours.

20:16.249 --> 20:17.113
You dig?

20:19.386 --> 20:21.144
Um, yeah, yeah.

20:21.146 --> 20:23.833
Hey, no problem, yeah.

20:25.273 --> 20:26.455
Sorry about that.

20:26.457 --> 20:28.024
- Fuck!
- Oh, I don't think so, you.

20:28.026 --> 20:29.720
Get the fuck away
from me, go on, fuck off!

20:29.722 --> 20:30.554
Sit down!

20:30.937 --> 20:33.688
- Man, take the gun.
- Don't move.

20:33.690 --> 20:34.999
Okay, take the gun.

20:35.001 --> 20:38.170
Okay, now, here's what
I want you to do, okay?

20:39.130 --> 20:39.898
Look at me, man.

20:40.922 --> 20:43.992
I'm really sorry
that I offended you.

20:43.994 --> 20:47.352
So, what I want you
to do, I want you...

20:47.354 --> 20:48.824
Hey, hey, man.

20:48.826 --> 20:50.040
- Kill me, come on.
- Hey, hey.

20:50.042 --> 20:51.416
Oh no, you wanna do it here.

20:51.418 --> 20:52.440
Is that where you wanna do it?

20:52.442 --> 20:54.328
Yeah, right in there, you know.

20:55.994 --> 20:58.745
You fucking idiot!

20:58.747 --> 21:00.665
- You little fuck!
- Sit down!

21:00.667 --> 21:02.232
I'm down, I'm sitting down.

21:02.234 --> 21:05.720
You fuckers are all
the same, you know!

21:05.722 --> 21:07.065
Oh, you see me
coming in you think

21:07.067 --> 21:09.402
I'm some kind of
dope smoking hippie!

21:10.747 --> 21:13.017
I ain't no fucking hippie, man!

21:13.019 --> 21:14.745
That's not my trip!

21:14.747 --> 21:16.667
You know who I am, huh?
You know who I am?

21:18.875 --> 21:20.729
Do you know who I am?

21:20.731 --> 21:22.585
Fuck what you're gonna do!

21:22.587 --> 21:24.537
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do!

21:24.539 --> 21:27.769
Before I leave you will be dead

21:27.771 --> 21:30.105
and I'm gonna take
the fucking girl!

21:30.107 --> 21:32.379
You're fucking
mine man, huh, huh?

21:34.555 --> 21:35.642
Okay, white boy.

21:36.571 --> 21:40.186
You might get away
today, but someday,

21:40.892 --> 21:43.064
me and my boy we're
comin' up to that ranch

21:43.066 --> 21:45.177
and we're gonna kill
you and every other

21:45.179 --> 21:48.506
hippie motherfucker that
we see up in that bitch!

21:48.508 --> 21:49.659
You dig?

21:49.979 --> 21:53.436
I told you, I ain't no
fucking hippie, motherfucker!

22:06.780 --> 22:07.836
Motherfucker!

22:08.539 --> 22:11.036
Look what you made
me do, motherfucker!

22:11.580 --> 22:12.475
Alright?

22:13.020 --> 22:13.980
That's the way, Charlie.

22:14.268 --> 22:15.228
You know
why I came here?

22:15.516 --> 22:16.827
That's a nice shirt there, man.

22:17.309 --> 22:18.460
Fuck this!

22:20.349 --> 22:22.364
I'm the guy who owns your life.

22:26.076 --> 22:27.516
Death don't mean shit.

22:29.564 --> 22:30.300
Take it off.

22:30.781 --> 22:31.674
The shirt?

22:31.676 --> 22:33.211
You want the shirt?

22:33.213 --> 22:34.778
Shirt's coming off, man.

22:34.780 --> 22:36.059
You can have the shirt.

22:36.061 --> 22:37.115
I don't give a fuck
about the shirt.

22:37.117 --> 22:39.004
Alright? Just take the shirt.

22:44.349 --> 22:45.724
Here, I don't need it.

22:46.492 --> 22:47.515
I don't need it.

22:47.517 --> 22:49.019
It's yours, man, take the shirt.

22:49.021 --> 22:50.268
Take the shirt and go.

22:54.301 --> 22:57.404
Mmm, you smell good.

22:59.229 --> 23:02.334
Just like a guy I
knew when I was 17.

23:04.158 --> 23:06.045
Pleasure doing
business with you.

23:09.150 --> 23:10.557
Let's go.

23:22.269 --> 23:25.532
I'll tell you what, it's
like a morgue in here, man.

23:25.534 --> 23:27.003
I mean, I know you're off it.

23:27.005 --> 23:29.246
I know that and
I'm glad for you.

23:30.302 --> 23:31.391
But I'm not.

23:32.126 --> 23:33.852
- Go on and play me something.
- Yeah, you're not, I know.

23:33.854 --> 23:35.356
- Play me something.
- What are you on right now?

23:35.358 --> 23:36.796
- Deep and interesting.
- Something deep

23:36.798 --> 23:38.076
and interesting.

23:38.078 --> 23:39.420
Fuck, I don't.

23:39.422 --> 23:40.893
- Expensive.
- Okay, seriously, seriously.

23:40.895 --> 23:42.075
I've been working on something.

23:42.077 --> 23:43.387
Ah, alright.

23:43.389 --> 23:46.524
But I need you to
play for me so just,

23:46.526 --> 23:48.284
I don't know I've
got a couple chords...

23:48.286 --> 23:51.135
But I can't play
the fucking REM shit.

23:52.382 --> 23:55.133
It's about as deep as Danzig.

23:55.135 --> 23:56.861
- T.J.?
- Yeah?

23:56.863 --> 23:59.004
- No, I'm listening.
- No, I know, but I've known

23:59.006 --> 24:00.893
you for a long
time and you just...

24:00.895 --> 24:01.724
Oh, God!

24:01.726 --> 24:03.292
That's yesterday's tea,

24:03.294 --> 24:04.637
- you don't wanna drink that.
- No, I don't.

24:04.639 --> 24:05.917
Look, I haven't
been sleeping very well.

24:05.919 --> 24:07.263
- Can you just...
- Oh, no!

24:08.415 --> 24:10.556
You've got this fucking, like,

24:10.558 --> 24:12.796
Manson shit going on in
your head all the time!

24:12.798 --> 24:13.885
Manson shit?

24:13.887 --> 24:14.941
- No.
- Yeah!

24:14.943 --> 24:16.861
No, I'm just...

24:16.863 --> 24:18.270
So what you waiting for?

24:18.272 --> 24:19.901
I'm just trying to go
a different direction

24:19.903 --> 24:21.724
and I need your support,
like actual, real support.

24:21.726 --> 24:23.967
Can you just come down to
earth for a second, please?

24:24.543 --> 24:25.854
- Dark.
- Dark.

24:25.856 --> 24:27.549
Okay, you
want something dark?

24:27.551 --> 24:29.950
Let's do something different,
give us a new thing.

24:34.910 --> 24:36.127
Okay, I'm digging.

24:39.711 --> 24:41.151
I'm kind of still drunk.

24:41.824 --> 24:43.517
Okay, you and the booze, man.

24:43.519 --> 24:46.271
It's fine, cool,
just, there's coffee,

24:46.273 --> 24:47.326
you can sober up after.

24:47.328 --> 24:48.800
Yes, this is good, keep going.

a landlord is supposed to
provide full disclosure

27:00.834 --> 27:02.690
to a tenant renting a property?

27:04.131 --> 27:05.091
Yeah.

27:05.602 --> 27:07.619
Is there anything
else I should know?

27:08.260 --> 27:09.475
Like what?

27:11.587 --> 27:15.713
Like have you ever
had any reports

27:15.715 --> 27:18.947
of ghostly sightings
or anything like that?

27:21.251 --> 27:22.915
Have you seen something?

27:27.268 --> 27:28.035
Yeah.

27:31.332 --> 27:36.483
Well, uh, I guess you
know what happened in '69?

27:36.676 --> 27:38.403
Yeah, that's not what I've seen.

27:39.908 --> 27:41.153
Did anything else ever happen

27:41.155 --> 27:43.011
in the house before
or after '69?

27:45.444 --> 27:47.364
Actually, there was something.

27:48.804 --> 27:49.796
What happened?

27:50.276 --> 27:51.970
One of the first
couples to occupy

27:51.972 --> 27:55.426
the house back in the
'50s, they were newlyweds.

27:55.428 --> 27:58.884
The bride found out that the
groom had cheated on her.

27:59.844 --> 28:04.739
So the story goes after the
marriage was consummated

28:04.741 --> 28:09.699
and he fell asleep,
she stabbed him in bed

28:09.701 --> 28:11.812
with a knife from the kitchen.

28:16.453 --> 28:20.035
The whole story was hushed
up and never talked about.

28:20.037 --> 28:22.083
Would have sent the real
estate value plummeting.

28:22.085 --> 28:24.483
Some of my girlfriends
who occupied the house

28:24.485 --> 28:27.493
over the years have
said they saw a woman.

28:29.477 --> 28:32.515
A woman dressed in a
black wedding dress.

28:32.517 --> 28:35.365
"The bride in black"
they called her.

28:36.069 --> 28:39.173
But I gotta tell you,
Margot, as a friend,

28:39.909 --> 28:42.406
I wouldn't go too far
down that rabbit hole.

28:43.206 --> 28:46.757
Some crazy shit goes
on up in these hills.

28:47.269 --> 28:49.253
Why do you think they
call it <i>Hollyweird?</i>

28:50.277 --> 28:54.021
Some people think it's best
to let sleeping dogs lie.

30:08.967 --> 30:11.111
So what can I do for
you, Miss Lavigne?

30:11.878 --> 30:14.405
Right, so I'm actually,
this might seem strange.

30:14.407 --> 30:18.950
Uh, I'm here about a
famous case from 1969.

30:18.952 --> 30:21.512
Yeah, it's a little
bit before my time.

30:22.408 --> 30:23.432
I figured.

30:24.967 --> 30:27.749
It's the Tate murders
at Cielo Drive.

30:27.751 --> 30:28.807
You're familiar?

30:29.192 --> 30:31.558
You'd have to have lived under
a rock for years not to be.

30:31.560 --> 30:32.488
What about it?

30:32.680 --> 30:34.821
The case files, the
public case files,

30:34.823 --> 30:38.345
say the LAPD took rolls of film
from the attic at the house.

30:38.632 --> 30:39.592
Okay.

30:40.104 --> 30:42.855
I'm living at that
house now and I, uh,

30:43.784 --> 30:45.735
I guess I have a
personal interest.

30:46.568 --> 30:48.073
So I was just wondering whether

30:48.968 --> 30:51.015
they're still in
evidence or, if not,

30:51.017 --> 30:54.313
if anyone knew what was
on the rolls of film.

30:55.401 --> 30:57.353
I've never heard of that before.

30:58.441 --> 31:00.486
I'll tell you what, if
you leave me your number,

31:00.488 --> 31:03.270
I can check up on it for you
and maybe give you a call

31:03.272 --> 31:05.385
in the morning and let
you know what I find.

31:05.577 --> 31:06.887
That'd be great.

31:06.889 --> 31:08.455
- Can I use your pen?
- Yeah, of course.

31:08.457 --> 31:09.417
Thanks.

31:10.282 --> 31:11.721
This is my number at the house.

31:20.361 --> 31:23.015
Right, so, I can
expect your call?

31:23.017 --> 31:25.161
I'll give you a call.

31:26.760 --> 31:30.919
♪ Hearts in the night ♪

31:30.921 --> 31:35.398
♪ Fear by her side ♪

31:35.400 --> 31:37.768
♪ Every girl must hide ♪

31:37.770 --> 31:39.911
♪ From the bride in black ♪

31:43.978 --> 31:44.938
Hello?

31:45.194 --> 31:46.825
<i>Margot Lavigne?</i>

31:47.466 --> 31:48.839
Yeah.

31:48.841 --> 31:50.794
<i>It's Detective
David O'Halloran.</i>

31:51.689 --> 31:52.872
Oh, hi.

31:52.874 --> 31:54.216
<i>Listen, so I checked up on</i>

31:54.218 --> 31:56.008
<i>those rolls of film
you asked about</i>

31:56.010 --> 31:58.248
<i>and they're no longer
here at the station,</i>

31:58.250 --> 32:01.801
<i>but apparently they were booked
into evidence at one point.</i>

32:01.803 --> 32:03.112
<i>I don't know what
happened to them,</i>

32:03.114 --> 32:04.424
<i>perhaps they were returned to</i>

32:04.426 --> 32:06.571
<i>the house or the former owners.</i>

32:06.827 --> 32:08.362
No, they're not at the house.

32:10.186 --> 32:12.392
Does it say who logged them
in and out of evidence?

32:12.394 --> 32:15.432
<i>Sure, same guy
did both, actually.</i>

32:15.434 --> 32:18.795
<i>His name's Randone, Ted Randone.</i>

32:20.875 --> 32:23.753
Thank you, that is great.

32:23.755 --> 32:25.162
I really appreciate that.

32:25.164 --> 32:27.369
<i>Hey, I know
this is kind of forward,</i>

32:27.371 --> 32:31.275
<i>but, uh, would you like to go
for a drink with me sometime?</i>

32:34.026 --> 32:38.187
I, uh, I don't drink.

32:40.524 --> 32:41.931
<i>You drink coffee?</i>

32:44.939 --> 32:45.739
Sure.

32:46.763 --> 32:48.779
<i>Wanna grab
a coffee with me?</i>

32:51.306 --> 32:52.267
Yeah, okay.

32:53.452 --> 32:54.986
You find dating difficult?

32:56.523 --> 32:58.537
Usually as soon
as I tell someone

32:58.539 --> 33:00.971
I don't drink or do
drugs they just tune out.

33:01.645 --> 33:02.667
Really?

33:04.108 --> 33:04.876
Yeah.

33:07.309 --> 33:11.436
Most people are, for the social
life, they don't really...

33:13.676 --> 33:17.227
It makes them uncomfortable
when you're not into that.

33:21.100 --> 33:24.268
You know, um, I once
dated an addict.

33:25.740 --> 33:26.957
Oh.

33:29.356 --> 33:30.891
Well, I'd ask you how that went,

33:30.893 --> 33:33.517
but seeing as you're here
I'm guessing not so well.

33:34.797 --> 33:36.811
Well, I met her at the
tail end of her addiction.

33:36.813 --> 33:40.139
So I kind of helped
her get into recovery.

33:40.141 --> 33:41.898
Well, I mean, she
did it, of course,

33:41.900 --> 33:45.580
but I'd like to think
I helped a little bit.

33:46.637 --> 33:47.946
I'm sure you did.

33:47.948 --> 33:51.180
Then when she got clean
we kind of grew apart.

33:53.197 --> 33:55.083
It got a little
scary at times, but,

33:55.085 --> 33:57.612
you know, I gotta give
her a break on that.

33:58.925 --> 34:01.709
I know recovery is like
learning to live all over again.

34:02.188 --> 34:05.387
She seemed to be quite a
resentful person, though.

34:05.389 --> 34:07.469
I think she really
struggled with that.

34:10.158 --> 34:12.013
Well, in recovery they say that

34:12.909 --> 34:15.596
resentment is a
number one offender.

34:16.525 --> 34:18.027
People can be sober for years,

34:18.029 --> 34:19.659
but if they harbor resentments,

34:19.661 --> 34:21.676
one day the house of
cards comes tumbling down.

34:21.678 --> 34:25.262
So, it is a tough
thing to go through.

34:28.558 --> 34:31.534
Well, you certainly don't make
it any easier on yourself.

34:32.237 --> 34:33.580
What do you mean?

34:33.581 --> 34:35.563
Living in the
Manson murder house?

34:35.565 --> 34:37.388
I mean, come on.

34:37.389 --> 34:38.607
It's a creative thing.

34:39.373 --> 34:40.908
I don't know, the
music I'm writing,

34:40.909 --> 34:43.759
the themes I'm circling,
it just...

34:46.126 --> 34:47.855
feels right.

34:48.590 --> 34:49.931
There's something there.

34:49.934 --> 34:52.141
I don't know what it
is, but I can sense it.

34:53.838 --> 34:55.022
Yeah.

34:56.143 --> 34:58.478
Well, it takes a
lot of bravery to do that.

35:49.360 --> 35:50.224
Hello?

35:50.416 --> 35:51.855
<i>This Margot?</i>

35:52.655 --> 35:53.615
It is, yeah.

35:54.224 --> 35:56.621
<i>You left a message
with my wife.</i>

35:56.623 --> 35:57.934
<i>Name's Randone.</i>

35:57.936 --> 36:01.293
Oh, thank you for
calling me back.

36:01.295 --> 36:02.734
<i>Yeah, right, listen,</i>

36:02.736 --> 36:04.910
<i>let's get something
straight from the off,</i>

36:04.912 --> 36:06.638
<i>so no one wastes anyone's time.</i>

36:06.640 --> 36:08.014
Okay.

36:08.016 --> 36:10.414
<i>I'll talk to anyone,
but I don't talk for free.</i>

36:10.416 --> 36:14.128
<i>You want information you better
be prepared to pay for it.</i>

36:14.832 --> 36:16.016
How much?

36:16.656 --> 36:17.776
<i>Five grand.</i>

36:22.193 --> 36:23.374
That's pretty steep.

36:23.376 --> 36:25.358
<i>Risk versus reward.</i>

36:25.360 --> 36:28.590
<i>Time may have passed, but
the shit I could tell you</i>

36:28.592 --> 36:31.601
<i>about those tapes might
still get me clipped.</i>

36:34.160 --> 36:35.152
Can you meet tomorrow morning?

36:36.752 --> 36:41.233
<i>Yeah, Franklin Park,
tennis court, 7 a.m.</i>

36:42.033 --> 36:45.007
<i>I'll be the guy in
the red button-up.</i>

36:45.009 --> 36:47.344
<i>Oh, and I don't take checks.</i>

37:01.265 --> 37:02.223
Margot?

37:02.225 --> 37:03.057
Randone.

37:03.857 --> 37:05.009
You got the money?

37:20.562 --> 37:21.298
You're that singer.

37:21.841 --> 37:24.402
Pay me five grand and I'll
answer your questions.

37:26.482 --> 37:27.666
Alright.

37:29.297 --> 37:31.215
You wanna know what
was on those rolls

37:31.217 --> 37:33.904
of film we seized
from Cielo Drive?

37:33.906 --> 37:34.866
Yeah.

37:35.602 --> 37:37.746
Sex stuff, mostly.

37:38.867 --> 37:40.336
Between who?

37:40.338 --> 37:43.635
Mostly it's a bunch of
celebrities, orgies, whatnot.

37:44.178 --> 37:46.064
You still own the rolls of film?

37:46.066 --> 37:47.952
No, a couple of those
actors who were in

37:47.954 --> 37:50.864
that film bought 'em
from me for a hell

37:50.866 --> 37:53.265
of a lot more than five
grand, I can tell you.

37:53.267 --> 37:56.786
A couple of those guys had reps
for being tough leading men.

37:57.715 --> 37:59.025
They weren't so
tough or leading,

37:59.027 --> 38:01.969
in those films, if
you get what I mean.

38:03.731 --> 38:05.747
So it was just
sex stuff, mostly?

38:06.835 --> 38:08.465
No, not quite.

38:08.467 --> 38:12.467
There's, uh, there's one film
that's real fucking strange.

38:13.362 --> 38:14.131
How so?

38:15.923 --> 38:19.763
It's a ritual, like a
black mass kind of thing.

38:20.627 --> 38:22.001
I have no idea who
the people are in it.

38:22.003 --> 38:25.841
They're all wearing
dark robes with hoods.

38:25.843 --> 38:27.857
You can't see their
faces, but basically,

38:27.859 --> 38:31.442
they're doing some
kind of satanic service

38:31.444 --> 38:33.556
or some shit, right
there in the house.

38:34.035 --> 38:35.282
Do you
think it was shot

38:35.284 --> 38:37.236
at the same time
as the sex stuff?

38:37.747 --> 38:39.954
Sit down, for fuck's sake.

38:39.956 --> 38:42.450
Was it filmed the same
time as the sex party?

38:42.452 --> 38:43.443
I don't know.

38:44.372 --> 38:46.322
The house looks different.

38:46.324 --> 38:48.178
The film stock is a lot older.

38:48.180 --> 38:49.522
It could have been filmed years

38:49.524 --> 38:51.761
before the Manson
family went up there.

38:51.763 --> 38:54.452
A lot of people have lived
there over the years.

38:55.603 --> 38:59.026
Do you think that
the Manson family

38:59.028 --> 39:00.724
was into that cult shit?

39:01.811 --> 39:03.826
I know the District
Attorney liked to peddle

39:03.828 --> 39:07.893
all that cult crap,
but I gotta tell you,

39:09.173 --> 39:14.004
anyone who was around in '69
knew what really went down.

39:14.741 --> 39:18.771
Yeah, there was a hell of
a lot of innocents caught

39:18.773 --> 39:21.587
in the crossfire,
but the main players

39:21.589 --> 39:26.451
in that whole circle, well,
let's put it this way:

39:26.453 --> 39:29.685
you live freaky, you die freaky.

39:31.381 --> 39:32.788
Nice doing business with you.

39:53.973 --> 39:57.429
I'm organizing this huge
party and I'm after some LSD.

39:58.838 --> 39:59.798
How much?

40:00.373 --> 40:01.589
A thousand tabs.

40:02.805 --> 40:04.213
Shit, that's a lot, man.

40:04.885 --> 40:06.133
More than we got here.

40:08.438 --> 40:10.837
You know anyone else
who sells in bulk?

40:12.213 --> 40:14.868
Yeah, a guy I know
called Hinman.

40:14.870 --> 40:16.439
He helps us out
from time to time.

40:16.917 --> 40:19.061
He's got his own lab.

40:19.063 --> 40:20.628
Can turn shit
around pretty quick.

40:20.630 --> 40:22.390
What kind of price we talking?

40:23.477 --> 40:25.013
A thousand bucks.

40:27.703 --> 40:31.091
If the turnaround is gonna be
quick, I'm happy with that.

40:31.093 --> 40:32.439
I'll give him a call.

40:42.518 --> 40:46.903
You can move somewhere but
there ain't nowhere you can go.

40:47.894 --> 40:52.341
The universe, man, is
just spinning around and...

40:53.271 --> 40:55.060
Your buddy sold me shit!

40:55.062 --> 40:55.989
What the fuck are
you talking about?

40:55.991 --> 40:57.589
It was fucking shit!

40:57.591 --> 40:59.860
A couple of my guys keeled
over on that fucking stuff!

40:59.862 --> 41:01.525
Why the fuck you comin' to me?

41:01.527 --> 41:03.381
The guy's usually okay!

41:03.383 --> 41:04.917
You think I'm a
fucking idiot, huh?

41:04.919 --> 41:05.845
Uh, man...

41:05.847 --> 41:07.254
Back off, pal!

41:07.256 --> 41:11.414
Man, man, look, look,
okay, okay, alright?

41:12.760 --> 41:14.646
You're being really
negative, man.

41:14.648 --> 41:16.084
Alright, don't be
negative, okay?

41:16.086 --> 41:17.526
It's a beautiful day.

41:17.528 --> 41:19.093
There's a load of beautiful
girls around here.

41:19.095 --> 41:21.589
We got some wine
and stuff, you know.

41:21.591 --> 41:24.309
I'm not in the mood
for socializing, pal.

41:24.311 --> 41:25.111
Right.

41:25.912 --> 41:27.446
- Okay.
- Back the fuck off.

41:27.448 --> 41:29.750
Alright, okay, okay.

41:29.752 --> 41:31.670
If this guy, you know,
he agrees with you.

41:31.672 --> 41:33.911
If he agrees with
you and he says that

41:34.905 --> 41:38.839
it's really bad shit, it's
a bad trip, whatever, okay?

41:38.841 --> 41:39.670
Mm-hmm.

41:39.672 --> 41:42.935
He, him, will make it up to you.

41:42.937 --> 41:45.910
- Yeah?
- I'll give you one week.

41:45.912 --> 41:47.446
One week.

41:47.448 --> 41:50.455
To get me the good shit I
paid for or my money back.

41:50.457 --> 41:51.321
You got that?

41:53.784 --> 41:55.447
Right, two days.

41:58.041 --> 41:59.032
I got it.

41:59.961 --> 42:02.745
Come on, you, my soul.

42:04.409 --> 42:05.558
One
week, motherfucker,

42:05.560 --> 42:07.062
- one fucking week!
- Come on!

42:07.064 --> 42:08.568
- Fucking crazy motherfucker.
- Come on!

42:09.528 --> 42:10.936
Yeah, huh?

42:18.297 --> 42:19.480
Bobby.

42:20.473 --> 42:22.393
Guess I better go
see Hinman, huh?

42:24.376 --> 42:27.897
Look Gary, you sold me bunk!

42:28.793 --> 42:30.807
And now I gotta
get the money back.

42:30.809 --> 42:32.727
There's no two ways about it.

42:32.729 --> 42:35.321
It's a really bad scene.

42:36.025 --> 42:37.751
Look Bobby, I can appreciate

42:37.753 --> 42:39.801
you're in a right
tight spot, dude.

42:40.921 --> 42:43.865
But, I never had complaints
about my shit before.

42:44.761 --> 42:47.415
And plus, those
guys didn't give me

42:47.417 --> 42:48.920
any of the tabs
back to check out.

42:48.922 --> 42:50.519
So, why?

42:50.521 --> 42:52.343
It looks like they're trying
to fucking rip me off.

42:52.345 --> 42:53.754
I ain't giving them shit.

42:55.321 --> 42:58.552
And anyway, I spent
all the money, Bobby.

42:58.554 --> 43:01.178
I got, like, $20
dollars to my name, man.

43:02.171 --> 43:04.344
So you're just gonna let
them fucking kill me?

43:04.346 --> 43:06.778
'Cause that's what
they're gonna do, Gary!

43:08.635 --> 43:10.201
What can I say, Bobby?

43:10.203 --> 43:13.402
It's a real fucking tough
business out there, pal!

43:15.802 --> 43:16.794
Fuck!

43:19.642 --> 43:20.857
Bobby, Bobby!

43:20.859 --> 43:23.192
Fuck!

43:23.194 --> 43:25.880
Sadie, hold the gun
on this motherfucker!

43:25.882 --> 43:26.968
Don't do it, Bobby!

43:26.970 --> 43:28.056
I'm gonna tear this house apart

43:28.058 --> 43:29.880
and get that fucking money!

43:29.882 --> 43:32.217
What the fuck you doing?

43:32.219 --> 43:33.593
You crazy fuck!

43:33.595 --> 43:36.217
What the fuck you
doing to my head, man?

43:36.219 --> 43:37.881
- Fuck, Sadie!
- Bobby, Bobby!

43:37.883 --> 43:39.067
Bobby, he's got the gun!

43:43.355 --> 43:44.825
Goddamn it, Gary!

43:44.827 --> 43:46.073
Be cool, man!

43:46.075 --> 43:47.609
Just be
quiet, you stop it!

43:47.611 --> 43:48.633
Be cool, man!

43:48.635 --> 43:50.393
Get the fuck up right now, Gary!

43:50.395 --> 43:51.227
Get up!

43:52.507 --> 43:54.267
Come on, come on.

43:57.435 --> 43:58.236
Come on, Gary.

43:58.651 --> 44:01.403
Bruce, it's Sadie.

44:02.491 --> 44:04.858
We need your help
over at Hinman's.

44:04.860 --> 44:06.748
Things are getting out of hand.

44:06.971 --> 44:09.370
Come on, come on.

44:09.372 --> 44:10.714
Goddamn it, Gary, you gotta have

44:10.716 --> 44:12.793
something here worth
some fucking money!

44:12.795 --> 44:14.073
What are you doing?

44:14.075 --> 44:15.386
Where the fuck you going?

44:15.388 --> 44:16.412
What are you doing?
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

44:16.635 --> 44:18.042
I got a car out front, man.

44:18.044 --> 44:19.770
It's easily worth
a thousand bucks.

44:19.772 --> 44:22.012
You fucking take that car
and you fucking fly, dude!

44:25.148 --> 44:26.812
Just fuck off, man!

44:36.476 --> 44:37.308
Look, man...

44:40.220 --> 44:42.333
Get your fucking
hands off me, man.

44:42.684 --> 44:45.051
I'm sorry I had to be this way.

44:45.053 --> 44:47.037
Those guys are gonna
fucking kill me.

44:55.068 --> 44:56.381
Are you expecting someone?

44:58.685 --> 45:00.027
No, man.

45:00.029 --> 45:01.786
Look, Gary, we're
gonna be leaving soon.

45:01.788 --> 45:04.219
So just make your excuses

45:04.221 --> 45:06.173
and get rid of
whoever it is, okay?

45:06.813 --> 45:08.797
What the fuck you doing, Bobby?

45:10.045 --> 45:11.931
I swear, I'm gonna
be out of your hair.

45:11.933 --> 45:14.429
You're never gonna have
to see me again, okay?

45:17.597 --> 45:18.653
Oh, shit!

45:20.638 --> 45:21.820
Motherfucker!

45:21.822 --> 45:22.716
- Huh, huh?
- What the fuck, man?

45:22.718 --> 45:23.773
I got something for you!

45:24.702 --> 45:26.139
What the fuck is that, man?

45:26.141 --> 45:28.254
- Huh, huh?
- No, no, no!

45:36.830 --> 45:39.804
He's just given us a car
to pay the money back!

45:39.806 --> 45:42.077
Shut the fuck up!

45:43.582 --> 45:45.979
I should kill you right
now, motherfucker,

45:45.981 --> 45:49.694
and show you that death,
it ain't no thing, man!

45:50.462 --> 45:51.964
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

45:51.966 --> 45:53.307
It's nothing, you know?

45:53.309 --> 45:58.494
Death is just, you walk
into another bridge.

45:59.294 --> 46:01.055
You're going to
another dimension.

46:01.694 --> 46:02.973
You're just lying there like

46:02.975 --> 46:05.374
a scared motherfucker
full of fear!

46:08.703 --> 46:11.359
You don't need to be
frightened of death.

46:13.343 --> 46:16.895
Living, that's what you
wanna be frightened of.

46:18.111 --> 46:19.903
You wanna be
frightened of living.

46:25.311 --> 46:27.839
Beautiful thing, it's beautiful.

46:28.863 --> 46:31.039
It's a beautiful thing.

46:35.295 --> 46:36.735
Have a nice day.

46:41.791 --> 46:42.749
Shit!

46:42.751 --> 46:45.756
Fuck, Bobby.

46:45.758 --> 46:47.102
I need a fucking ambulance, man.

46:47.104 --> 46:48.832
Get some towels!

46:49.056 --> 46:51.295
I need a fucking ambulance, man!

46:51.968 --> 46:53.277
What's it look like, man?

46:53.279 --> 46:54.749
- How bad is it, man?
- It's fine.

46:54.751 --> 46:57.150
Come on, put some
pressure on this, okay?

46:57.152 --> 46:58.622
Put some pressure on it.

46:58.624 --> 47:00.446
Bobby, I need an ambulance, man.

47:00.448 --> 47:02.335
I can't do that, Gary.

47:03.039 --> 47:05.246
The cops are gonna come and
we're all gonna get busted.

47:05.248 --> 47:08.030
Fuck, fuck, Bobby!

47:08.032 --> 47:09.886
I swear I won't
say anything, man.

47:09.888 --> 47:11.806
I'll just say I
was in a bar fight.

47:11.808 --> 47:13.855
- I'm sorry, Gary.
- Bobby, please.

47:26.336 --> 47:28.321
I'm really sorry, Gary.

47:29.376 --> 47:31.136
I didn't want it to be this way.

47:32.737 --> 47:34.624
Fuck, what, Bobby, Bobby!

47:36.352 --> 47:39.807
You fuck...

48:14.145 --> 48:17.023
I gave them something
that they didn't have.

48:17.025 --> 48:19.135
These are all rejects
of your society, man.

48:19.137 --> 48:22.208
You wanna throw 'em
away, all over the place.

48:22.210 --> 48:23.520
I just picked them up.

48:23.522 --> 48:25.376
I gave them freedom, you know?

48:25.378 --> 48:27.583
<i>Freedom, that's what I am,</i>

48:27.585 --> 48:29.025
<i>that's what I represent.</i>

48:29.027 --> 48:30.657
<i>So, you wanna ask me?</i>

48:32.162 --> 48:34.401
<i>You know nothing.</i>

48:35.298 --> 48:38.338
<i>But in here, man, in here.</i>

48:40.418 --> 48:41.984
<i>Put me in a darkened room.</i>

48:41.986 --> 48:44.035
<i>To you it's the end.</i>

48:46.594 --> 48:48.351
<i>To me it's just
the beginning, man.</i>

48:48.353 --> 48:52.642
<i>I'm swirling around the midsts
of time and I am in my mind!</i>

48:55.170 --> 48:56.259
<i>And I'm free.</i>

48:57.379 --> 49:00.832
<i>I won't die, I'm immortal.</i>

49:32.099 --> 49:33.090
Jesus!

49:33.092 --> 49:34.883
Sorry, I didn't
mean to scare you.

49:37.411 --> 49:40.322
I'm sorry, don't I know
you from somewhere?

49:40.324 --> 49:42.209
We met at the cafe.

49:42.211 --> 49:43.233
Right, yeah.

49:43.235 --> 49:45.218
Sorry, I didn't mean to intrude.

49:45.220 --> 49:47.811
I just felt like there's
something you should know.

49:49.187 --> 49:50.659
Do you wanna come in?

49:52.549 --> 49:55.298
Maybe we could go elsewhere.

49:55.300 --> 49:56.771
Perhaps the cafe?

49:57.507 --> 49:59.491
Sure, yeah, let me grab my keys.

50:09.700 --> 50:11.010
I've been thinking a lot about

50:11.012 --> 50:13.157
what you said, that
it wasn't a dream.

50:14.885 --> 50:16.324
What did you mean by that?

50:28.228 --> 50:33.412
The Big Bang did not happen
once but many, many times.

50:34.341 --> 50:36.643
It was an event of such
extraordinary magnitude

50:36.645 --> 50:39.427
that it caused echoes
of itself to occur

50:39.429 --> 50:43.076
on slightly different
planes of existence.

50:43.078 --> 50:47.426
Each universe is created
slightly differently.

50:47.428 --> 50:50.019
So, when they grew and evolved,

50:50.021 --> 50:52.227
they would gradually grow apart.

50:52.229 --> 50:56.357
Sometimes in subtle ways and
sometimes in drastic ways.

50:57.349 --> 51:01.957
We all have our own
personal timeline.

51:04.581 --> 51:09.413
But when we make a decision
we create a parallel timeline.

51:10.662 --> 51:13.828
So you could choose
to turn right

51:13.830 --> 51:15.491
but then you make
a decision later

51:15.493 --> 51:18.019
on which takes you to the left.

51:18.021 --> 51:19.141
Do you follow?

51:21.126 --> 51:22.180
What does this have to do with

51:22.182 --> 51:24.100
what's happening in the house?

51:24.102 --> 51:27.300
Ghosts aren't the
spirit of dead people.

51:27.302 --> 51:29.571
They are inter-dimensional
projections

51:29.573 --> 51:33.574
of people who are very much
alive in another timeline.

51:34.950 --> 51:39.910
You see, time is not linear,
even though we pretend it is.

51:40.583 --> 51:44.388
Time does not, in fact, exist.

51:44.390 --> 51:47.268
You see, these
timelines and visions

51:47.270 --> 51:50.052
that we see are other timelines

51:50.054 --> 51:52.231
moving into our
present timeline.

51:53.319 --> 51:56.614
We are catching a glimpse
of the other side.

51:59.911 --> 52:02.823
I've never experienced
these things before, so...

52:03.591 --> 52:07.367
Why are they happening
now on Cielo Drive, why?

52:08.135 --> 52:10.439
Have you heard of ley lines?

52:11.527 --> 52:12.359
No.

52:14.535 --> 52:20.743
You see, there are energy
ley lines and true ley lines.

52:21.288 --> 52:25.605
Energy ley lines are fractures
in the Earth's crust.

52:25.607 --> 52:29.542
But true ley lines, they are
straight trader's tracks.

52:29.544 --> 52:34.085
You see, there are
five pre-aligned,

52:34.087 --> 52:37.160
pre-Reformation
sacred sites on them.

52:39.687 --> 52:45.254
One of these lines runs below
that house on Cielo Drive.

52:45.256 --> 52:49.958
When two ley lines
cross, or intersect,

52:49.960 --> 52:53.576
a vortex of negative
energy is created.

52:55.913 --> 52:58.374
Energy's entities can feed off

52:58.376 --> 53:02.344
this lower vibrational
spirit and begin to manifest.

53:03.497 --> 53:09.670
10050 Cielo Drive is a place
where two such ley lines cross,

53:09.672 --> 53:13.480
an intersect, a vortex
of negative energy.

53:15.240 --> 53:17.320
They can also affect people.

53:22.537 --> 53:25.415
So why me?

53:25.417 --> 53:27.143
Am I attracting this?

53:27.145 --> 53:30.023
The lore of
attraction states that

53:30.025 --> 53:33.031
we are attracting what
we are sending out.

53:33.033 --> 53:36.007
So, positive energies
attract positive

53:36.009 --> 53:39.145
and negative energies
attract negative.

53:39.914 --> 53:42.281
Am I attracting these entities?

53:43.433 --> 53:47.912
Fate and destiny are palpable
elements in the universe.

53:49.226 --> 53:52.072
Our timelines are predetermined.

53:52.074 --> 53:54.727
You need to look at
yourself and consider

53:54.729 --> 53:58.568
whether staying in that
house is a good idea.

53:58.570 --> 54:02.696
There are always signs
given to us about our fate.

54:02.698 --> 54:05.705
The key is to see those signs.

54:19.275 --> 54:20.616
Hello?

54:20.618 --> 54:21.546
<i>Hey, how's it going?</i>

54:23.402 --> 54:24.971
Earlier, I saw you.

54:26.538 --> 54:27.817
You were on the driveway,
you were crying.

54:27.819 --> 54:30.120
I came out to see
you, you took off.

54:30.122 --> 54:32.297
<i>I didn't come
to your place earlier.</i>

54:32.299 --> 54:33.866
Quit pulling my
chain, I saw you.

54:34.219 --> 54:35.784
<i>Whoever you
saw, it wasn't me.</i>

54:35.786 --> 54:37.735

<i>And leave a sign behind,

56:01.932 --> 56:04.365
Roman won't
be happy about this.

56:05.196 --> 56:06.445
You gonna tell him?

56:07.436 --> 56:11.787
No, but as soon as I have the
baby this all stops, right?

56:11.789 --> 56:12.813
Of course!

56:21.038 --> 56:25.516
You know, it could
have been so different.

56:26.766 --> 56:28.298
It could have been
my baby inside there.

56:28.300 --> 56:29.613
Not again, Jay.

56:31.310 --> 56:34.029
We've been through this,
we tried, it didn't work.

56:41.325 --> 56:43.086
Can you honestly say
you're happier now?

56:43.342 --> 56:45.900
I don't want to go
through this again.

56:45.902 --> 56:48.397
I've made my choice and
I'm sticking with it.

56:49.550 --> 56:51.214
You told me he lies!

56:52.174 --> 56:54.061
And you pretend to believe him.

56:55.694 --> 56:57.357
It isn't always easy.

56:58.478 --> 57:01.644
But I don't regret it because
he's given me this baby.

57:01.646 --> 57:03.183
Some things are just fated.

57:05.390 --> 57:07.659
Oh, friends from Chatsworth.

57:07.661 --> 57:09.678
Come in, come in.

57:11.758 --> 57:12.974
Jay's in the living room.

57:25.423 --> 57:26.477
Good evening, all.

57:26.479 --> 57:27.247
How are we?

57:29.103 --> 57:31.278
I'll be in my
room if you need me.

57:31.280 --> 57:32.430
Okay.

57:43.727 --> 57:46.924
I thought you said
she was gonna be in Europe?

57:46.926 --> 57:48.047
Her husband is.

57:49.072 --> 57:50.638
But don't worry, she's cool.

57:50.640 --> 57:52.143
We've got an understanding.

57:53.103 --> 57:54.128
Uh-huh.

57:59.120 --> 58:01.679
Anyone in the guest house?

58:03.472 --> 58:05.773
Some kid's been
hanging out with Bill.

58:05.775 --> 58:07.631
Why, you wanna party?

58:08.911 --> 58:10.288
Not tonight, man.

58:11.183 --> 58:14.510
We gotta get back.

58:14.512 --> 58:16.209
So, how much do you want?

58:18.767 --> 58:20.049
All of it.

58:21.265 --> 58:22.672
Tex, what the fuck, man?

58:26.640 --> 58:29.840
Just bag it all
up and shut the fuck up.

58:30.576 --> 58:32.175
Katie, come on,
there's no need for this!

58:32.177 --> 58:33.935
Shut up and do what he says!

58:33.937 --> 58:35.759
You guys are in
real trouble here.

58:35.761 --> 58:37.071
You know who we
are connected to?

58:37.073 --> 58:39.249
Shut up, you Polack
piece of shit!

58:41.426 --> 58:42.704
What's going on?

58:46.226 --> 58:47.376
Tex!

58:47.568 --> 58:49.999
I'll go after her,
you watch these three.

59:14.353 --> 59:15.665
Please.

59:16.721 --> 59:17.743
Please help us.

59:34.481 --> 59:35.473
Inside.

59:38.770 --> 59:39.602
Now!

59:40.786 --> 59:41.778
Move!

59:45.009 --> 59:46.033
Move!

59:48.979 --> 59:49.970
Sit down!

59:51.730 --> 59:53.168
Were those gunshots?

59:53.170 --> 59:54.130
Shut up!

59:55.922 --> 59:56.882
Alright.

59:57.714 --> 59:58.833
We're gonna take a
trip to that place

59:58.835 --> 01:00:01.328
you got up on Easton Drive.

01:00:01.330 --> 01:00:02.673
Just take me, you
don't need her!

01:00:02.675 --> 01:00:05.779
Don't dictate to me,
you fucking maggot!

01:00:06.931 --> 01:00:09.459
I'm the one who's holding
all the cards here.

01:00:10.194 --> 01:00:12.210
Who the fuck do
you think you are?

01:00:20.979 --> 01:00:22.386
I am the devil.

01:00:23.763 --> 01:00:26.643
And I'm here to do
the devil's business.

01:00:34.227 --> 01:00:35.859
Watch her and the Polack.

01:00:37.203 --> 01:00:40.372
These two are coming
on a little ride.

01:00:41.235 --> 01:00:42.195
Move!

01:00:50.996 --> 01:00:51.796
Move!

01:01:11.285 --> 01:01:12.530
What was that?

01:01:12.532 --> 01:01:13.684
I'll go find out.

01:01:14.868 --> 01:01:15.860
Watch him.

01:01:26.772 --> 01:01:27.700
Don't move!

01:01:28.405 --> 01:01:30.005
Please, please.

01:01:30.612 --> 01:01:33.460
I have no mercy for you, bitch.

01:01:44.309 --> 01:01:46.227
Look, why don't
we take it easy...

01:01:46.229 --> 01:01:47.987
Hey, sit the fuck down!

01:01:47.989 --> 01:01:50.037
Sit down, sit the, fuck!

01:01:54.486 --> 01:01:56.053
Please, please.

01:01:56.981 --> 01:02:01.813
Please.

01:02:02.166 --> 01:02:02.902
Please, please.

01:02:06.101 --> 01:02:08.021
- Shh, shh.
- No!

01:02:20.150 --> 01:02:21.142
You can stop.

01:02:23.286 --> 01:02:25.525
You've already killed me.

01:02:37.782 --> 01:02:39.381
Fuck you!

01:02:45.078 --> 01:02:46.485
Go find the Polack.

01:03:14.711 --> 01:03:15.479
Fuck.

01:03:16.919 --> 01:03:18.199
You gonna die.

01:03:19.190 --> 01:03:21.110
You're gonna fucking
die, motherfucker.

01:03:26.359 --> 01:03:28.181
You fucker!

01:03:28.183 --> 01:03:30.230
You fuck!

01:03:30.232 --> 01:03:31.063
You're a fucker!

01:04:09.401 --> 01:04:11.062
What happened after you left?

01:04:11.064 --> 01:04:13.494
So, we, uh, we
showered off using

01:04:13.496 --> 01:04:17.721
the neighbor's hose pipes
and changed clothes.

01:04:20.568 --> 01:04:22.294
Neighbors see you?

01:04:22.296 --> 01:04:24.281
Uh-huh, but it was fine, man.

01:04:25.497 --> 01:04:26.838
We got out of there quick

01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:29.559
and he had no idea
where we'd been, man.

01:04:29.561 --> 01:04:31.511
And then we dropped the clothes

01:04:31.513 --> 01:04:33.046
and the bloody weapons down that

01:04:33.048 --> 01:04:35.190
sheer drop at Benedict Canyon.

01:04:38.521 --> 01:04:39.321
Fuck, man!

01:04:39.928 --> 01:04:41.082
What the fuck?

01:04:41.561 --> 01:04:43.862
Motherfucker, you trying to
stick me the fuck back inside?

01:04:43.864 --> 01:04:46.007
I don't wanna go in
the joint anymore, man!

01:04:46.009 --> 01:04:47.543
You know what I did
to get out here?

01:04:47.545 --> 01:04:49.912
Everything we've done to
crawl up from the shit?

01:04:49.914 --> 01:04:50.905
Motherfucker!

01:04:53.050 --> 01:04:54.745
I'm sorry, man, look.

01:04:55.674 --> 01:04:57.527
I know I fucked up.

01:04:57.529 --> 01:05:01.978
Soon as I get on the crank
shit just escalate's you know?

01:05:04.571 --> 01:05:05.945
I'm sorry, man, come on.

01:05:09.371 --> 01:05:10.426
I love you, man.

01:05:13.051 --> 01:05:13.915
I love you too, man.

01:05:15.674 --> 01:05:16.442
I do.

01:05:17.978 --> 01:05:19.546
I'm sorry, man, I am.

01:05:21.562 --> 01:05:22.839
I'm real sorry.

01:05:22.841 --> 01:05:24.855
This is what we're gonna do.

01:05:24.857 --> 01:05:25.880
What, man?

01:05:25.882 --> 01:05:28.219
Old Charlie, he's gonna rise up

01:05:29.689 --> 01:05:30.843
and clean your shit.

01:05:34.843 --> 01:05:36.536
We're gonna go back there.

01:05:36.538 --> 01:05:38.808
Yeah, okay.

01:05:38.810 --> 01:05:41.114
- Clean everything up.
- Uh-huh.

01:05:54.459 --> 01:05:56.123
Oh, shit.

01:05:58.299 --> 01:05:59.867
You motherfucker.

01:06:00.795 --> 01:06:03.290
This is fucked
up is what it is, man.

01:06:08.154 --> 01:06:09.976
No man,
this is the end.

01:06:09.978 --> 01:06:14.394
Mankind, he's gonna
kill himself.

01:06:28.379 --> 01:06:30.364
Hey, I got
you some coffee.

01:06:31.677 --> 01:06:32.541
Thanks.

01:06:41.148 --> 01:06:41.980
Are you hungry?

01:06:43.068 --> 01:06:43.868
Not really.

01:06:50.781 --> 01:06:53.532
I know, but will you
try eating for me?

01:06:55.933 --> 01:06:56.924
Yeah.

01:07:00.444 --> 01:07:01.341
Thank you.

01:07:02.428 --> 01:07:05.658
I'll head to the grocery store
and I'll pick up a few things

01:07:05.660 --> 01:07:08.187
and I'll come back and
I'll make us something.

01:07:08.189 --> 01:07:09.404
Okay?

01:08:15.774 --> 01:08:17.660
Annie, what...

01:08:20.670 --> 01:08:25.180
There are always signs
given to us about our fate.

01:08:25.183 --> 01:08:27.871
The key is to see those signs.

01:08:35.551 --> 01:08:36.764
I once dated an addict.

01:08:36.765 --> 01:08:38.269
It got a little scary at times.

01:08:38.270 --> 01:08:41.372
She seemed to be quite a
resentful person, though.

01:08:41.375 --> 01:08:44.029
It wasn't a dream.

01:09:02.432 --> 01:09:06.719
<i>The thing about
freedom is, real freedom,</i>

01:09:08.095 --> 01:09:10.559
<i>it's something they
wanna take away from you.</i>

01:09:11.808 --> 01:09:14.301
<i>Now, the way they take
that away from you,</i>

01:09:14.303 --> 01:09:19.071
<i>okay, is by creating fear.</i>

01:09:20.031 --> 01:09:21.822
- <i>Oh.</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

01:09:21.823 --> 01:09:23.551
<i>The confusion...</i>

01:09:24.479 --> 01:09:28.573
<i>and the chaos and your
fractured realities</i>

01:09:28.576 --> 01:09:31.613
<i>and your subdivisions,
you know, all that.</i>

01:09:31.615 --> 01:09:32.448
<i>Yeah</i>.

01:09:33.345 --> 01:09:34.816
<i>It's more
than they can handle.</i>

01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:38.113
<i>You can take a pile of rocks</i>

01:09:39.073 --> 01:09:41.279
<i>and you can choose
to build a house.</i>

01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:45.535
<i>Or you can take that
same pile of rocks</i>

01:09:45.537 --> 01:09:48.511
<i>and you can choose
to make a war.</i>

01:09:48.513 --> 01:09:49.345
<i>Alright?</i>

01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:53.183
<i>And the government,
they're telling the kids,</i>

01:09:53.185 --> 01:09:56.319
<i>don't throw any rocks,
and they're making</i>

01:09:56.321 --> 01:09:58.943
<i>all these rules and
these regulations.</i>

01:09:58.945 --> 01:10:02.721
<i>But what they're doing, they're
driving the people crazy.</i>

01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:10.337
<i>For all of us, the conventional
world hasn't worked.</i>

01:10:12.385 --> 01:10:15.616
<i>Death is the biggest
trip of all, right, Charlie?</i>

01:10:15.618 --> 01:10:18.015
<i>There is no death.</i>

01:10:18.017 --> 01:10:21.154
<i>Death is just an
extension, you know?</i>

01:10:22.114 --> 01:10:23.969
<i>You're just going
to another place.</i>

01:10:25.441 --> 01:10:26.882
<i>Your eyes are an ocean.</i>

01:10:28.898 --> 01:10:29.794
<i>And your soul...</i>

01:10:32.546 --> 01:10:34.177
<i>is my universe.</i>

01:10:36.386 --> 01:10:40.960
<i>This is a
song about something</i>

01:10:40.962 --> 01:10:43.106
<i>that I'm not even
thinking about.</i>

01:10:44.322 --> 01:10:46.946
<i>It's a song I'm not
even thinking about</i>

01:10:47.682 --> 01:10:53.538
