WEBVTT

00:12.560 --> 00:15.400
Mate, what am I going to say? Just
say the police were there before us.

00:15.400 --> 00:17.920
Also, we should tell him we took one
of the rucksacks. No way!

00:17.920 --> 00:19.680
They'll string us up!

00:19.680 --> 00:21.120
What if we just turned up?

00:21.120 --> 00:22.920
Turned up?
Like we found it.

00:22.920 --> 00:24.640
They wouldn't believe us!
They'd know.

00:24.640 --> 00:27.960
Someone gave it to us
in Elland, near the flat.

00:27.960 --> 00:31.040
Someone near the flats, in the
flats, found it, gave it to us,

00:31.040 --> 00:33.440
realised it belonged to us. When?
When did this happen?

00:33.440 --> 00:34.640
Yesterday. This morning.

00:34.640 --> 00:36.960
So why are we only telling him now?
Why weren't we telling

00:36.960 --> 00:39.360
Viktor when he come round and asked
about the rucksacks?

00:39.360 --> 00:41.360
Look, we can't tell him
about the rucksack.

00:41.360 --> 00:43.800
We have to stick to the story that
we never saw any rucksacks

00:43.800 --> 00:45.760
or we're even more dead
than we already are.

00:45.760 --> 00:47.880
Look, if Josip talks...
Say he's lying!

00:47.880 --> 00:50.000
Look, we get rid of it.
We just...

00:50.000 --> 00:52.680
We go back to our house,
get the rucksack, ditch it.

00:52.680 --> 00:54.560
Maybe keep a few pounds
each.

00:54.560 --> 00:57.280
Maybe.
A few hundred pounds each.

00:57.280 --> 00:59.040
Or we run.

00:59.040 --> 01:01.720
We take the money, all of it,
and then we just disappear.

01:01.720 --> 01:04.080
I'm getting married
on Wednesday!

01:04.080 --> 01:06.840
I can't just disappear.
We ditch it.

01:06.840 --> 01:09.120
We fetch it from the house,
we keep a few hundred quid

01:09.120 --> 01:11.960
and we ditch it. We should have
handed it over when we could have.

01:11.960 --> 01:14.240
Yes. Yeah, but we didn't.

01:16.680 --> 01:19.360
Viktor. Viktor, the police
have got Josip.

01:19.360 --> 01:21.480
They were already there
when we turned up.

01:52.720 --> 01:53.760
I'm off, love.

01:55.040 --> 01:56.880
I don't get it.
I sat in a meeting

01:56.880 --> 01:59.840
about this interview strategy
with this Josip lad,

01:59.840 --> 02:02.880
and all they're going to do him
for is false imprisonment

02:02.880 --> 02:04.360
and money-laundering.

02:04.360 --> 02:06.480
What about rape,
for God's sake?

02:06.480 --> 02:07.560
And murder?

02:07.560 --> 02:08.600
Yeah. Well...

02:09.640 --> 02:12.520
That's a minefield,
accusing him of rape.

02:12.520 --> 02:14.680
If she consented to sex
at the time, assuming

02:14.680 --> 02:17.320
they had sex at all, which, of
course, we don't know...

02:17.320 --> 02:18.840
She thought he was
her boyfriend.

02:18.840 --> 02:21.520
That's what the neighbour said.
What, you think they were

02:21.520 --> 02:23.240
just holding hands?
How must she have felt

02:23.240 --> 02:24.920
when she realised
what was going on?

02:24.920 --> 02:26.520
As I say,
nobody can prove that...

02:26.520 --> 02:29.280
And how is it not manslaughter at
the very least?

02:29.280 --> 02:31.880
Well, the thing is...
I know. I've heard it all before.

02:31.880 --> 02:33.840
He didn't intend
that she should die.

02:33.840 --> 02:37.560
So what? She died. Because they were
up to no good in her flat.

02:37.560 --> 02:41.960
OK. So our job is to make
the law work as best we can

02:41.960 --> 02:44.800
in whatever circumstances we find
ourselves dealing with.

02:44.800 --> 02:47.720
And, yeah...it don't always fit the
bill.

02:47.720 --> 02:50.040
How can you not know
that if you imprison someone,

02:50.040 --> 02:52.880
they might try and escape, and if
you're on the fourth floor

02:52.880 --> 02:56.120
of a building, it might prove fatal?
How can you not know that?

02:56.120 --> 02:59.800
I agree. I'm right there with you.
But the reality is,

02:59.800 --> 03:01.880
there's no point charging him
with something

03:01.880 --> 03:04.240
we know the defence are just
going to bat away, is there?

03:04.240 --> 03:06.160
They've got to charge him
with something

03:06.160 --> 03:08.840
where we know there's a chance of
making it stick... Yeah, I know.

03:08.840 --> 03:11.720
..and getting a
conviction out of it. You know.

03:11.720 --> 03:14.200
Is this the wrong time,
the wrong case

03:14.200 --> 03:16.680
for you to be starting
your attachment to CID with?

03:16.680 --> 03:18.480
No.

03:21.680 --> 03:23.400
I'll see you tomorrow.

03:23.400 --> 03:25.040
Oh, and then,

03:25.040 --> 03:27.360
all they're going to do about
her falling out the window

03:27.360 --> 03:29.480
is get the Health and Safety
Executive involved.

03:29.480 --> 03:31.400
Yeah, well...
What are they going to do?

03:31.400 --> 03:33.880
Fill in some forms, open and
close a few filing cabinets?

03:33.880 --> 03:36.160
No, the Health and Safety
Exec are very powerful.

03:36.160 --> 03:38.360
They can get people sent
to prison the same as we can.

03:38.360 --> 03:40.640
Yeah, well, they need to get
their fingers out

03:40.640 --> 03:42.120
and get on with it.

03:42.120 --> 03:44.080
Did you give him
that registration number

03:44.080 --> 03:45.880
of that little grey Honda
we spotted?

03:47.040 --> 03:48.120
No, not yet.

03:48.120 --> 03:49.760
Are you shitting me?

03:49.760 --> 03:51.000
No.

03:52.400 --> 03:56.440
I thought... Wouldn't it just be
people rubbernecking? Right. What?

03:57.840 --> 03:59.400
Catherine, what?

03:59.400 --> 04:01.440
I had an instinct it was more,
but 'twas ever thus.

04:02.600 --> 04:05.600
Five minutes with CID,
you know more than I do.

04:05.600 --> 04:06.800
Good luck.

04:10.080 --> 04:11.680
Sarcastic bitch.

04:13.320 --> 04:14.720
Dozy sod.

04:39.880 --> 04:42.320
# There's a tower block overhead

04:42.320 --> 04:46.120
# And all you got's your benefits
and you're barely scraping by

04:49.480 --> 04:51.760
# In this trouble town

04:51.760 --> 04:54.880
# Troubles I've found

05:00.040 --> 05:02.280
# Stuck in speed bump city

05:02.280 --> 05:06.720
# Where the only thing that's pretty
is the thought of getting out. #

05:23.600 --> 05:25.440
Hey, down here. Down here.

05:37.200 --> 05:38.360
Shit.

05:38.360 --> 05:39.920
What is it? Shit!

05:39.920 --> 05:41.920
Don't answer it.

05:44.440 --> 05:47.000
Answer it. Go.

05:52.200 --> 05:53.640
Viktor.

05:53.640 --> 05:57.600
I've spoken to Darius.
I've told him what happened.

05:57.600 --> 05:59.280
He wants to see you.
Darius? When?

06:00.640 --> 06:02.040
This evening. Both of you.

06:03.480 --> 06:06.120
I'll pick you both up at the
top of your road in two hours.

06:07.240 --> 06:08.800
All right?
Right.

06:12.280 --> 06:13.480
What?!

06:13.480 --> 06:15.000
What?

06:17.240 --> 06:18.680
Eh?

06:18.680 --> 06:20.120
Come on, we're burying this.

06:21.160 --> 06:22.680
Fuck.

06:46.200 --> 06:47.560
Come on.

07:00.560 --> 07:01.720
Joanna?

07:16.440 --> 07:19.480
I'm telling you, Colonel,
the baron's up to something...

07:31.600 --> 07:34.280
Don't look at me like that.

07:34.280 --> 07:35.360
Go in there.

07:37.280 --> 07:39.840
And for goodness' sake,
take your coat off.

08:01.640 --> 08:03.680
Thank you.

08:15.600 --> 08:17.800
Er, that's £4.12, please.

08:20.840 --> 08:22.440
Thank you. See you.

08:28.040 --> 08:29.600
There you go.

08:31.560 --> 08:32.760
Thank you.

08:41.240 --> 08:44.440
That's £5.22, please.

08:45.920 --> 08:47.240
Have a good day. Ta-ta.

08:51.600 --> 08:53.360
How do?

08:53.360 --> 08:55.680
Have you been in a fight?

08:55.680 --> 08:57.040
Several.

08:58.960 --> 09:01.520
I know you're cross.
Really?

09:01.520 --> 09:03.720
Give me a packet of paracetamol.

09:10.480 --> 09:13.440
I don't want you and Clare
falling out.

09:17.800 --> 09:19.680
Do you know what he did
to Becky?

09:19.680 --> 09:22.120
That vacuous thug
that you go and sit with?

09:23.680 --> 09:25.160
Yeah, I know that...

09:25.160 --> 09:26.600
Well, I know that...

09:26.600 --> 09:29.600
You know what Clare's told
you. Yeah, and Daniel.

09:29.600 --> 09:31.080
Well, Clare don't know everything,

09:31.080 --> 09:32.880
and Daniel certainly doesn't.

09:32.880 --> 09:35.240
He wasn't much more than a
kid himself when it happened,

09:35.240 --> 09:37.920
so they have their version
and I have mine.

09:37.920 --> 09:40.480
And there are certain facts
and details

09:40.480 --> 09:42.360
that only me and Richard ever knew,

09:42.360 --> 09:44.840
and it was worse than
any of you will ever know,

09:44.840 --> 09:46.520
what he did to her, all right?

09:46.520 --> 09:49.680
And I'm not going to tell you how,
but I'm asking you very sincerely

09:49.680 --> 09:52.680
to trust what I'm telling you
when I say

09:52.680 --> 09:55.400
that that thing is not human.

09:55.400 --> 09:58.640
And I'm asking you not to take
Ryan to see him again, Neil.

09:59.640 --> 10:02.520
Right.
He's a black hole.

10:02.520 --> 10:04.920
He's a nasty, negative
nothing who sucks the life

10:04.920 --> 10:07.080
and anything good out of
anything he touches.

10:09.440 --> 10:10.520
I know.

10:11.640 --> 10:13.000
I think I know that now.

10:16.080 --> 10:18.720
Did Ryan bully you
into taking him? No.

10:19.840 --> 10:21.880
No.

10:21.880 --> 10:24.560
But he went on and on.

10:24.560 --> 10:27.400
For weeks.
Just wouldn't let it drop.

10:27.400 --> 10:29.440
And I did say no at the start.

10:29.440 --> 10:31.760
I said no God knows
how many times.

10:31.760 --> 10:33.800
Yeah, so he wore you down.
That's bullying.

10:33.800 --> 10:37.680
Pushing somebody into doing
something they've made it plain

10:37.680 --> 10:39.440
they don't want to do. It wasn't...

10:39.440 --> 10:41.320
It weren't nasty.

10:42.880 --> 10:44.960
The thing is, Catherine...

10:46.440 --> 10:47.800
..he'd have gone anyway.

10:49.200 --> 10:50.960
He'd have found a way.

10:50.960 --> 10:52.880
He's that determined.

10:55.080 --> 10:57.440
At least this way
I could keep an eye on it.

10:57.440 --> 10:59.040
Will you stop?

11:00.120 --> 11:01.480
Promise me you'll stop.

11:01.480 --> 11:03.480
I'll deal with the fallout.
He can come home

11:03.480 --> 11:06.320
if he wants to come home. I'll say
anything that needs saying.

11:06.320 --> 11:08.880
But will you promise me
that you won't facilitate

11:08.880 --> 11:10.360
him going there again?

11:11.800 --> 11:13.040
Yeah.

11:19.640 --> 11:22.880
I've already said I'm not
taking him tomorrow.

11:22.880 --> 11:24.320
What's tomorrow?

11:25.640 --> 11:27.720
Tommy Lee Royce is in court,

11:27.720 --> 11:33.360
in Leeds, for sentencing for that
Gary Gackowski business.

11:33.360 --> 11:36.880
He wanted Ryan to go.
Did he? Why?

11:36.880 --> 11:38.440
To see him. Why?

11:38.440 --> 11:40.600
In court, being sentenced? Why?

11:40.600 --> 11:42.240
Just to see him.

11:42.240 --> 11:44.200
But I told him, I said,

11:44.200 --> 11:46.320
"There's no way you'll
get out of school for that.

11:46.320 --> 11:47.960
"Nobody's going to
agree to that."

11:47.960 --> 11:50.000
And Ryan understood that.

11:51.080 --> 11:52.400
Would you please call Clare?

11:52.400 --> 11:54.680
She's been trying to get hold
of you all day. She...

11:54.680 --> 11:56.720
She's upset.

11:56.720 --> 11:59.560
I don't have much to say
to her, to be honest.

12:04.680 --> 12:11.000
# My girl, my girl
Where will you go?

12:11.000 --> 12:15.640
# I'm going
where the cold wind blows

12:17.680 --> 12:20.800
# In the pines, in the pines

12:20.800 --> 12:24.240
# Where the sun don't ever shine

12:24.240 --> 12:28.600
# I would shiver
the whole night through

12:31.120 --> 12:37.360
# My girl, my girl
Don't lie to me

12:37.360 --> 12:42.160
# Tell me where did you sleep
last night?

12:44.760 --> 12:47.480
# In the pines, in the pines

12:47.480 --> 12:50.880
# Where the sun don't ever shine

12:50.880 --> 12:57.400
# I would shiver
the whole night through

12:57.400 --> 13:04.280
# My girl, my girl
Where will you go?

13:04.280 --> 13:07.480
# I'm going where the
cold wind blows... #

13:20.160 --> 13:22.000
Yeah, looking good.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.280
Have a look.

13:33.360 --> 13:34.440
Yeah.

13:36.640 --> 13:38.000
Yeah, sound.

13:41.840 --> 13:44.560
Yeah, man.
Nice, geezer.

13:44.560 --> 13:46.160
Here. Sure?

13:46.160 --> 13:48.120
Yeah. Nice.

14:01.240 --> 14:03.880
Why's Tommy Lee Royce asked Ryan to
go and see him

14:03.880 --> 14:05.400
in court tomorrow? Has he?

14:05.400 --> 14:07.080
Well, apparently - I've just seen
Neil.

14:07.080 --> 14:08.480
What have you done to your face?

14:08.480 --> 14:11.280
Yeah, well, it's nothing. Why would
you want your kid - a kid -

14:11.280 --> 14:13.640
to go into court to watch you
being sentenced

14:13.640 --> 14:16.360
for God knows how long on top of
what you're already serving

14:16.360 --> 14:19.040
for murder? Do you know
there's a woman outside

14:19.040 --> 14:20.680
doing something
to your Land Rover?

14:20.680 --> 14:22.280
Yeah, it'll be Alison.

14:22.280 --> 14:24.720
She said she'd fit me that
new alternator I got on eBay.

14:24.720 --> 14:26.160
Does she know what she's doing?

14:26.160 --> 14:28.160
Yes, of course.
She's a farmer. Well, she was

14:28.160 --> 14:30.400
until I arrested her.
What for? Manslaughter.

14:30.400 --> 14:32.200
Are you
listening to what I'm saying?

14:33.200 --> 14:35.120
Well, is Ryan going?

14:35.120 --> 14:36.920
God knows.
Neil said he's made it clear

14:36.920 --> 14:39.000
that he's not taking him,
but it's not that anyway.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.120
He can go or not go, he can
do what the fuck he likes.

14:41.120 --> 14:42.880
It's the why. It's the why
would he ask him

14:42.880 --> 14:44.480
to go? It just...

14:44.480 --> 14:46.760
Hiya!
Hiya.

14:46.760 --> 14:48.680
Do you want some tea?
Sure.

14:52.280 --> 14:53.720
Well, I don't know. To see him.

14:53.720 --> 14:55.920
He sees him when he visits him.

14:55.920 --> 14:57.640
Did you not offer her a cup of tea?

14:57.640 --> 14:59.200
To see him
in a different context.

14:59.200 --> 15:01.440
In a suit.
I didn't know who she was.

15:02.600 --> 15:04.760
Manslaughter?
Who did she kill?

15:04.760 --> 15:07.280
Her son. He'll be wanting
to show off, won't he?

15:07.280 --> 15:09.280
To show off what a hard man
he is,

15:09.280 --> 15:11.040
sticking two fingers up
at authority,

15:11.040 --> 15:12.440
reckoning he doesn't care.

15:13.680 --> 15:16.080
I tell you what, though.
You should go.

15:17.360 --> 15:20.880
If this rumour
that he's...he's fibbing

15:20.880 --> 15:23.200
to protect Darius Knezevic

15:23.200 --> 15:25.880
over that Gary Gackowski
murder's true, you should go.

15:28.480 --> 15:29.720
Thanks.

15:37.560 --> 15:39.480
Is it true Chris Oxley
alibied himself

15:39.480 --> 15:40.840
for the date Gary was murdered?

15:40.840 --> 15:42.520
Of course he did.
It was all bollocks.

15:42.520 --> 15:45.600
It's just Royce trying to
waste police time,

15:45.600 --> 15:47.240
like the wankertron he is.

15:47.240 --> 15:49.760
No, you're right. I should.
I should go. And it's tomorrow?

15:49.760 --> 15:51.760
Yeah. I'm not going.

15:51.760 --> 15:53.480
No, you don't need to go.

15:54.480 --> 15:55.920
Why did she kill her son?

15:55.920 --> 15:58.160
I went to his mother's funeral.

15:58.160 --> 16:00.480
Tommy Lee Royce's mother's
funeral. That was...

16:00.480 --> 16:03.800
Did you? Yeah. Well, I found her
body, so he decided

16:03.800 --> 16:05.720
that must mean I'd murdered
her. Went berserk

16:05.720 --> 16:07.960
when he saw me. They had to
carry him out screaming.

16:07.960 --> 16:10.520
Why did you go?
To look at him. I don't know.

16:10.520 --> 16:14.080
To be there if he tried to
escape, I don't know.

16:14.080 --> 16:15.960
It's Alison Garrs.

16:17.920 --> 16:20.960
She killed her son
because he was Daryl Garrs.

16:20.960 --> 16:22.640
Wow. Yeah.

16:22.640 --> 16:24.280
You hungry?

16:24.280 --> 16:26.760
Yeah, I've got to
go and get changed.

16:26.760 --> 16:28.760
Is there enough for Alison?

16:29.760 --> 16:31.120
Sure. Sure.

16:31.120 --> 16:33.160
She don't bite.
No, just shoots people...

16:33.160 --> 16:34.600
Yeah, well, she won't shoot you.

16:34.600 --> 16:37.360
I've found out
all sorts of stuff about him.

16:38.360 --> 16:39.480
About who?

16:39.480 --> 16:41.680
Darius Knezevic.
And his brother,

16:41.680 --> 16:43.800
Zeljko. There's two of them.

16:43.800 --> 16:45.920
Now, Zeljko's the eldest,
and he's smart enough,

16:45.920 --> 16:48.440
but he's also big,
like a brick shithouse.

16:48.440 --> 16:50.400
And Darius, well, he just...

16:50.400 --> 16:52.320
Just takes everything
to the next level.

16:52.320 --> 16:53.400
Everything he touches.

16:53.400 --> 16:56.000
And between them, that's how
they've become this legend

16:56.000 --> 16:57.760
in their own lunchtimes.

16:57.760 --> 16:59.720
You know, somebody I spoke to

16:59.720 --> 17:01.600
reckons it was Zeljko and Darius

17:01.600 --> 17:04.320
that were on that motorbike when
Ashley Cowgill were shot.

17:04.320 --> 17:07.200
Do you remember,
there were reports of two men

17:07.200 --> 17:08.960
on a motorbike? Well...

17:08.960 --> 17:11.040
Yeah. After they pulled that off,

17:11.040 --> 17:12.440
they became proper contenders.

17:12.440 --> 17:14.160
And Darius has something
like tripled,

17:14.160 --> 17:18.160
quadrupled his activities and
simultaneously endeavoured,

17:18.160 --> 17:22.200
and to some not insignificant
degree succeeded,

17:22.200 --> 17:24.120
in cleaning up his image.

17:24.120 --> 17:25.560
I hate it.

17:25.560 --> 17:28.280
I left a message for him. He's
agreed to an interview with me

17:28.280 --> 17:31.360
in his capacity as
a prospective local councillor.

17:31.360 --> 17:33.280
You want to be careful.

17:33.280 --> 17:36.520
I should definitely go to that
sentencing thing in Leeds tomorrow.

17:50.920 --> 17:52.640
What do you think?

17:52.640 --> 17:53.880
Do you like it?

17:55.360 --> 17:56.560
Just bought it.

17:58.760 --> 18:00.920
Nice. Nice.
It's very nice.

18:03.480 --> 18:05.440
It's been on the market
for years.

18:05.440 --> 18:07.560
Probably because of the roof.

18:07.560 --> 18:10.320
Two and a half acres
of asbestos.

18:12.720 --> 18:14.360
Zeljko's here.

18:15.440 --> 18:18.680
Hey, Zeljko. Hey, Zeljko. Idiots.

18:18.680 --> 18:20.080
Hi, Viktor.

18:20.080 --> 18:23.680
15 acres, the whole plot.

18:26.960 --> 18:28.560
What would you do with it?

18:33.880 --> 18:36.000
C-Car park? Car park?

18:36.000 --> 18:37.080
Yeah.

18:41.360 --> 18:44.080
What would you do with it?

18:46.120 --> 18:49.440
I... I'm...
Yeah, I can't decide either.

18:50.600 --> 18:52.160
Flats is the obvious one.

18:52.160 --> 18:54.040
Nice flats, classy flats -

18:54.040 --> 18:57.600
swimming pool in the basement,
garden on the rooftop.

18:57.600 --> 19:00.280
But I think, what I think...
Darius, we...

19:03.200 --> 19:05.280
Fucking irritating

19:05.280 --> 19:07.440
fucking fuckwit!

19:33.920 --> 19:36.080
Josip won't talk, Darius.

19:37.240 --> 19:38.760
He wouldn't dare talk.

19:40.920 --> 19:45.640
Mr Clement's with him.
I know he won't talk.

19:45.640 --> 19:49.200
But things should never have
got this far.

19:49.200 --> 19:51.240
Have you any idea

19:51.240 --> 19:53.920
how much a lawyer like
Mr Clement costs?

19:53.920 --> 19:55.920
Have you? No, no! They...

19:55.920 --> 19:59.200
We made mistake with Josip.

19:59.200 --> 20:01.200
Huh? They are sorry.

20:01.200 --> 20:05.040
I am so... Why was there
so much money in the flat?

20:05.040 --> 20:06.760
We couldn't move it fast enough.

20:06.760 --> 20:09.440
As soon as we moved one lot
out, even more came in.

20:09.440 --> 20:13.040
It was crazy busy. So you moved some
shit-for-brains in to sit on it?

20:13.040 --> 20:14.480
We thought he was ready to step up.

20:14.480 --> 20:17.120
But we made a mistake with him.

20:21.640 --> 20:23.160
Help him up.

20:40.280 --> 20:43.600
I need to know that you are
going to be smarter than this

20:43.600 --> 20:44.760
in the future.

20:45.800 --> 20:47.440
Yeah, we are. We are, Darius.

20:47.440 --> 20:48.840
What about him?

20:48.840 --> 20:50.200
What about you, Ivan? Huh?

20:50.200 --> 20:53.880
Yeah. I'll... I'll be smarter than
this in the future.

20:54.920 --> 20:56.200
Right.

20:56.200 --> 20:58.160
Well...

20:58.160 --> 21:00.080
..I've got a job for you...

21:00.080 --> 21:02.680
..tomorrow,
and it's not difficult,

21:02.680 --> 21:06.600
but it needs doing properly,
at exactly the right time.

21:06.600 --> 21:08.120
What do you think?

21:08.120 --> 21:11.560
Do you think you can rise
to the occasion? Yes. Yes. Yes.

21:12.600 --> 21:15.360
So tomorrow,
you put your best suits on,

21:15.360 --> 21:18.600
and Guzim, not Viktor,
will pick you up

21:18.600 --> 21:20.040
at half past eight.

21:20.040 --> 21:23.000
But then, after the thing,
you'll come back separately,

21:23.000 --> 21:25.880
you on the train,
you on the bus.

21:26.960 --> 21:29.440
Where are we going?

21:29.440 --> 21:31.400
Leeds.

21:39.880 --> 21:41.240
Morning.

21:59.840 --> 22:01.280
Sit down there.

22:26.560 --> 22:28.640
Saw your granny last night.

22:28.640 --> 22:30.000
She came into the shop.

22:31.680 --> 22:32.720
And, er...

22:34.240 --> 22:37.040
..me and your Auntie Clare
was wondering that...

22:37.040 --> 22:39.800
..maybe we made a mistake
taking you to see him.

22:43.680 --> 22:45.480
Not a mistake, exactly.

22:45.480 --> 22:48.880
But perhaps...you know.

22:51.680 --> 22:55.280
It was something
you needed to do.

22:55.280 --> 22:57.520
And you have had a chance
now to get to know him a bit.

22:58.800 --> 22:59.840
But...

23:03.560 --> 23:05.360
I don't know.

23:12.120 --> 23:13.840
Perhaps...

23:13.840 --> 23:16.120
..we were wondering
that maybe it's a mistake...

23:16.120 --> 23:19.640
..for you to keep going.

23:19.640 --> 23:20.840
Now.

23:20.840 --> 23:24.320
Now that she does know. How do you
feel about not going again, Ryan?

23:26.280 --> 23:28.120
Do you want to keep seeing him?

23:32.400 --> 23:34.920
How important is it,
do you think?

23:34.920 --> 23:37.240
That you keep seeing him.
I don't know.

23:37.240 --> 23:41.440
She wants you to go home.
She did say that.

23:44.960 --> 23:46.600
But she does want you
to stop going to see him.

23:50.120 --> 23:52.320
And she did say
that there were things...

23:53.640 --> 23:55.000
..other folk never knew about.

23:57.400 --> 23:58.840
Before your mum died.

24:00.200 --> 24:01.560
The way he behaved, and that...

24:04.120 --> 24:05.640
..it's not very nice, Ryan.

24:10.120 --> 24:13.560
So how would you feel
about that? Mm?

24:13.560 --> 24:15.000
About going home.

24:17.080 --> 24:19.440
Not going to Sheffield any more.

24:29.320 --> 24:30.600
Dwell on it, love.

24:40.120 --> 24:42.280
The thing is, Mum, I might need
you to pick them up

24:42.280 --> 24:44.240
for most of this week,
depending on, you know,

24:44.240 --> 24:45.640
when she chooses to resurface.

24:45.640 --> 24:46.920
Have you rung her mum and dad?

24:46.920 --> 24:49.280
Yes, I've rung her mum and
dad, I've rung her sister,

24:49.280 --> 24:51.760
I've rung her friends,
in inverted commas. ..Teeth!

24:51.760 --> 24:54.000
Teeth, come on. Bathroom.

24:54.000 --> 24:57.360
So today... Which other days?
Er, yeah, definitely today

24:57.360 --> 24:59.840
cos I've got after-school
stuff. And...

24:59.840 --> 25:02.680
..tomorrow and Thursday.

25:02.680 --> 25:05.440
Well, I'll have to shift a few
things round in my diary.

25:05.440 --> 25:07.440
Yeah, well, if you could...

25:07.440 --> 25:09.000
..I'd be very grateful.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.680
OK.

25:10.680 --> 25:12.760
All right. Right.
And I'll phone you later.

25:12.760 --> 25:16.040
I mean, she'll probably turn up,
but, you know... All right.

25:16.040 --> 25:18.520
Bye. OK, bye. Bye-bye.

25:34.840 --> 25:39.840
You have one new voice
message and no saved messages.

25:39.840 --> 25:41.680
First new message.

25:43.720 --> 25:46.440
Hiya, Joanna.
It's Catherine Cawood

25:46.440 --> 25:48.520
from Skircoat Road
Police Station in Halifax.

25:48.520 --> 25:51.120
Er, just to say I've had the
forensic analysis report back

25:51.120 --> 25:52.560
on the pills I took from you,

25:52.560 --> 25:54.640
and I know you're not due
to answer bail

25:54.640 --> 25:56.520
for another two weeks,
but if you want to get it

25:56.520 --> 25:58.800
over and done with, I'm on
duty today until six o'clock,

25:58.800 --> 26:01.200
so...give us a ring
when you get this call,

26:01.200 --> 26:03.720
let me know how you're
fixed, OK, love? Bye-bye.

26:29.480 --> 26:32.920
Hi, it's Joanna. Please
leave your name and number...

26:40.080 --> 26:42.680
We need to be out of this door
in five minutes!

26:55.760 --> 26:58.720
Not more bloody roadworks.

26:58.720 --> 27:01.240
Daddy, I haven't got
my reading book.

27:01.240 --> 27:04.360
Well, we're not going back
now. You can do without it.

27:04.360 --> 27:07.120
I've told you before, you need to
pack your own bag properly.

27:08.440 --> 27:10.400
Shit!

27:10.400 --> 27:12.880
Oh, my God.
What the hell was that?

27:14.880 --> 27:15.960
Dad?

27:18.760 --> 27:20.960
Dad, don't get out.

27:23.240 --> 27:24.880
Stay in the car, ladies.

27:24.880 --> 27:27.120
What? Who's he calling ladies?

27:27.120 --> 27:29.000
What you playing at?
I had right of way.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.040
What are you playing at?

27:30.040 --> 27:32.800
I thought you were letting me in.
I'm on the road. You're on a drive.

27:32.800 --> 27:34.120
You wait for a space to clear!

27:34.120 --> 27:35.960
And you've gone into the
back of my vehicle,

27:35.960 --> 27:38.680
which, strictly speaking...
We have rules in this country, pal.

27:39.920 --> 27:41.560
We should exchange details.

27:41.560 --> 27:43.360
Driving off like shit off a shovel.

27:43.360 --> 27:44.480
Look at...

27:44.480 --> 27:46.000
Oh, my God. Look at this!

27:46.000 --> 27:47.480
We should take photographs.

27:47.480 --> 27:48.560
Look at it!

27:48.560 --> 27:51.640
I don't like this.
Oh, you want to see my licence?

27:51.640 --> 27:53.160
I'm happy to show you mine.

27:53.160 --> 27:55.560
Oh, my God, that guy
is going to lamp him one.

27:55.560 --> 27:57.240
I need your details.

27:57.240 --> 27:58.920
Yeah, and I need yours. Correct.

27:58.920 --> 28:01.040
Moron! Well, I'm not a moron,

28:01.040 --> 28:03.320
but you need to calm down.
Are you calling me a moron?

28:03.320 --> 28:06.720
No. No, that isn't
what just happened.

28:06.720 --> 28:09.160
Accidents happen. And the best way
to deal with them...

28:09.160 --> 28:13.080
Yeah. Accidents wouldn't happen if
morons obeyed the rules of the road

28:13.080 --> 28:15.200
and didn't drive like
they're trying to break

28:15.200 --> 28:18.200
the land-speed record
just to prove some shit.

28:18.200 --> 28:20.400
As I say, you went into
the back of me,

28:20.400 --> 28:22.000
so... You better be insured, pal.

28:23.360 --> 28:24.440
Are you all right?

28:26.320 --> 28:28.240
Are your little girls all right?

28:28.240 --> 28:30.600
The little girls in the car.

28:30.600 --> 28:34.600
We could show them that this can be
dealt with amicably, properly,

28:34.600 --> 28:35.680
without aggression.

28:36.880 --> 28:39.120
This isn't that bad.
It really isn't.

28:39.120 --> 28:40.400
At worst, it's inconvenient,

28:40.400 --> 28:43.520
and it may affect
your insurance premiums,

28:43.520 --> 28:45.240
but we can deal with it.

28:47.600 --> 28:49.520
Is something else upsetting you?

29:09.520 --> 29:10.960
Hello.

29:12.120 --> 29:13.240
Are you...?

29:13.240 --> 29:14.880
Are you all right?

29:14.880 --> 29:17.200
Neil said you'd been beaten up.

29:17.200 --> 29:20.080
Yeah, well, you should see
the other fella.

29:20.080 --> 29:23.160
He spent the night in a cell
facing false imprisonment

29:23.160 --> 29:24.880
and money-laundering charges, so...

29:26.400 --> 29:27.880
As long as you're all right.

29:27.880 --> 29:29.880
I were just ringing because

29:29.880 --> 29:31.600
I was thinking about
that woman, you know,

29:31.600 --> 29:32.720
that wife of that Hepworth

29:32.720 --> 29:35.200
that you arrested for illegal
possession of, what were it,

29:35.200 --> 29:39.520
diazepam? Anyway, I've got a group
session today at the mission,

29:39.520 --> 29:43.240
so I just thought about her and
thought it was worth mentioning.

29:43.240 --> 29:46.440
If you happened to see her
or you wanted to ring her.

29:46.440 --> 29:48.880
If she wanted to get in touch,
you could give her the number,

29:48.880 --> 29:50.480
or give her my number.

29:50.480 --> 29:54.400
Or just tell her to pop in,
maybe. Yeah.

29:54.400 --> 29:57.160
Or alternatively, you could shove
your misplaced do-gooding

29:57.160 --> 29:58.560
up your arse.

30:02.440 --> 30:06.400
Well... I hope... That's what I
wanted to talk to you about...

30:06.400 --> 30:07.920
..also. In fact, er...

30:09.320 --> 30:10.560
Neil got back last night,

30:10.560 --> 30:12.960
and obviously you and him
had had a conversation,

30:12.960 --> 30:14.720
and he said that you said

30:14.720 --> 30:16.920
there were things that I never knew

30:16.920 --> 30:20.280
about what happened

30:20.280 --> 30:22.040
before Becky died. Er...

30:22.040 --> 30:23.800
Anyway, we've made it...

30:23.800 --> 30:27.040
We've made it clear to Ryan
this morning that we are not...

30:27.040 --> 30:29.560
We're not happy taking him
any more.

30:29.560 --> 30:32.360
And I am sorry, Catherine.

30:32.360 --> 30:34.880
I can't stand it
when we're not friends.

30:34.880 --> 30:37.720
I hate it. And I'm sorry.
Hang on. I am sorry.

30:37.720 --> 30:40.240
Have you been standing there
all night?

30:40.240 --> 30:42.840
What have you got in there?
Body parts?

30:42.840 --> 30:45.400
Oh, spare uniform,
all to be handed in.

30:45.400 --> 30:48.440
Then, come Wednesday, I'm
having tea with the Chief Con,

30:48.440 --> 30:52.000
and Thursday, you can all
kiss my ample arse goodbye.

30:55.720 --> 30:57.120
Right. Well...

30:58.480 --> 31:00.560
..if and when I speak
to that Joanna, I'll tell her.

31:01.960 --> 31:04.840
Have you heard what I've said?

31:04.840 --> 31:06.560
Yeah.

31:06.560 --> 31:08.960
I love you, and I'm sorry.

31:12.960 --> 31:14.640
Has he gone to school all right?

31:14.640 --> 31:16.280
Has he definitely gone to school?

31:16.280 --> 31:17.600
Yeah. What...

31:17.600 --> 31:19.080
What do you mean?

31:19.080 --> 31:20.960
He's not secretly heading to Leeds

31:20.960 --> 31:24.400
to see that wanker in court?
Oh, right. No, no. Er...

31:24.400 --> 31:25.520
No...

31:25.520 --> 31:28.000
He set off on his bike.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.120
He left the flat same time as me.

31:30.120 --> 31:31.480
Right.

31:33.120 --> 31:35.600
I just thought it sounded odd,
the twisted fuck

31:35.600 --> 31:38.600
asking him to go and see him
in court. I did. I did!

31:38.600 --> 31:40.200
And the bungee-jumping.

31:40.200 --> 31:42.040
What bungee-jumping?

31:54.240 --> 31:57.160
The train now
approaching Platform 1

31:57.160 --> 32:01.880
is the 08.33 service to York
via Leeds.

32:42.400 --> 32:45.280
Start again. You think Tommy
Lee Royce is planning to escape

32:45.280 --> 32:47.800
because he told Ryan that they're
going bungee-jumping?

32:47.800 --> 32:50.480
Yeah. So why'd he say that?

32:50.480 --> 32:52.080
He's not supposed to be
going anywhere

32:52.080 --> 32:54.080
for the next 500 years.
So why would he say that?

32:54.080 --> 32:55.720
And he wanted Ryan in court.

32:55.720 --> 32:58.400
Not that he's gone.
He's gone to school, allegedly.

32:58.400 --> 33:00.760
But why? Why?
Why would he want him there

33:00.760 --> 33:03.000
just to see him sentenced?
No, no.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.560
He wants him there so that
when he doesn't turn up,

33:05.560 --> 33:08.160
he's there to witness
the fallout, the disarray.

33:08.160 --> 33:11.360
The big man sticking
two fingers up at the Crown.

33:12.720 --> 33:14.800
And what about me?
I need protection.

33:14.800 --> 33:16.840
Because if he gets out,
he's coming for me.

33:16.840 --> 33:19.600
You need to find out
what sort of escort he's got,

33:19.600 --> 33:22.800
and whatever it is,
they need to triple it.

33:22.800 --> 33:25.000
Do you think you're making
too much of

33:25.000 --> 33:27.120
what sounds like a few
glib comments he's dropped?

33:27.120 --> 33:29.280
Yeah, if it was anyone else,
I might, but it's not.

33:29.280 --> 33:31.040
You do know they'll have done

33:31.040 --> 33:33.520
a risk assessment
at the prison, don't you? Yeah.

33:33.520 --> 33:35.360
But I know more than they do,
don't I?

33:36.680 --> 33:40.200
Sarge. Fella on the phone
asking to talk to you.

33:40.200 --> 33:42.720
He says he knows you.
Rob Hepworth.

33:42.720 --> 33:44.320
Oh, yeah. Right.

33:44.320 --> 33:45.720
I'll make a phone call.

33:45.720 --> 33:48.640
All right? No. You need to do more
than that, because they could have

33:48.640 --> 33:51.520
someone blowing the doors off
the bloody paddy wagon as we speak.

33:56.480 --> 33:58.680
Ta.

33:58.680 --> 34:00.240
Sergeant Cawood.

34:00.240 --> 34:02.200
Did Joanna come and see
you yesterday?

34:02.200 --> 34:04.280
Er, morning, Mr Hepworth.

34:04.280 --> 34:06.200
Where is she? Joanna?

34:06.200 --> 34:08.760
Have you put her in
some shelter, some refuge?

34:09.840 --> 34:12.400
I don't have the power
to put people in shelters.

34:12.400 --> 34:14.360
They have to go there
of their own volition.

34:14.360 --> 34:16.320
Why would you think that,
Mr Hepworth?

34:18.640 --> 34:19.760
Hello?

34:21.560 --> 34:26.120
Because I know what you think,
and you're wrong. So...hang on.

34:26.120 --> 34:28.760
Are you telling me that
she's missing?

34:28.760 --> 34:30.440
You left a message!

34:30.440 --> 34:33.800
Yeah, I did leave a message asking
her to contact me, but she didn't.

34:33.800 --> 34:35.360
So when did you last see her?

34:35.360 --> 34:37.720
Yesterday. Morning.

34:37.720 --> 34:41.080
Look, I have a lot to put up
with her, you know.

34:41.080 --> 34:44.000
I know what you think,
but she's...

34:44.000 --> 34:45.360
..hard work.

34:45.360 --> 34:47.120
She's not normal.

34:47.120 --> 34:49.720
And I do do my best with her.

34:49.720 --> 34:52.520
Have you rung around her family
and friends? Yes.

34:52.520 --> 34:54.680
Have you rung the hospital?
No, no, no. She's...

34:54.680 --> 34:58.120
She's done it before.
Done what? Gone AWOL.

34:58.120 --> 34:59.720
And where was she last time?

34:59.720 --> 35:01.160
Her mother's.

35:01.160 --> 35:02.400
But she's not there now.

35:02.400 --> 35:05.360
Well, they say not,
but, you know, who knows?

35:05.360 --> 35:06.720
I bet she is.

35:06.720 --> 35:08.640
And why would they lie?

35:11.160 --> 35:12.360
It's complicated.

35:12.360 --> 35:15.160
And you last saw her
yesterday morning?

35:15.160 --> 35:18.160
Yes. And where was that?
Er, at home, in bed.

35:18.160 --> 35:20.600
She didn't get up.
She didn't get up to help with

35:20.600 --> 35:23.560
the breakfasts and the lunchboxes
and to see them off to school.

35:23.560 --> 35:26.520
You see, that's another thing...
So the children didn't see her

35:26.520 --> 35:29.520
yesterday morning, but you did?
I took her some tea.

35:31.000 --> 35:34.240
Right. So I think you should ring
around the hospitals, and if you

35:34.240 --> 35:36.480
draw a blank from that, then
you need to come back to me

35:36.480 --> 35:39.600
and we'll report her missing.
No, I haven't time! I'm at work!

35:39.600 --> 35:40.840
Right.

35:41.920 --> 35:43.240
Well, would you like me to do it?

35:43.240 --> 35:46.640
Huh! You'd be wasting your time.
She'll be hiding somewhere.

35:46.640 --> 35:47.800
Why?

35:47.800 --> 35:49.080
Oh, dramatic effect?

35:51.680 --> 35:54.160
She's a vulnerable person,
Mr Hepworth.

35:54.160 --> 35:55.880
Why is she vulnerable?

35:55.880 --> 35:58.920
Because she's possibly addicted
to prescription drugs.

35:58.920 --> 36:00.320
And, as you've outlined,

36:00.320 --> 36:03.080
her behaviour is often erratic
to the point where

36:03.080 --> 36:05.960
she's not taking care of
her own children.

36:05.960 --> 36:08.840
Plus, she failed to respond
to my phone calls yesterday.

36:08.840 --> 36:12.720
I left messages on her mobile
and on your landline.

36:12.720 --> 36:15.320
And so that's enough
to have me worried.

36:38.600 --> 36:41.800
I've got to go. Bye, love.

37:15.040 --> 37:16.360
Ah! Can I help you?

37:16.360 --> 37:17.520
I hope so.

37:17.520 --> 37:19.640
I hope we're not overreacting,
but we're worried

37:19.640 --> 37:21.920
we might need to report
someone missing.

37:21.920 --> 37:24.160
Oh. Can I take some details?

37:24.160 --> 37:26.440
We're not sure how long it's
been since anyone saw her,

37:26.440 --> 37:30.680
but... Yeah. Can I take your name?
My name? Tim. Fielding.

37:30.680 --> 37:34.480
We think it's been at least
two days and possibly a lot more.

37:34.480 --> 37:36.520
It's our daughter.
And what's your address?

37:36.520 --> 37:41.320
She's 26.
76 Hockmore Road.

37:41.320 --> 37:43.000
That's Copley.

37:45.400 --> 37:46.680
But she doesn't live with us.

37:46.680 --> 37:50.360
She lives with her...husband.
Er, contact number?

37:50.360 --> 37:51.400
I'll give you my mobile.

37:51.400 --> 37:56.040
It's 07700 900 143.

37:56.040 --> 37:58.120
We've rung her sister,
her friends.

37:58.120 --> 38:00.640
Her sister's rung round
a few other people.

38:00.640 --> 38:02.720
We've been to Calderdale
Royal and nothing.

38:02.720 --> 38:06.200
And what's her name? We've rung
the GP surgery, but of course

38:06.200 --> 38:08.120
they won't tell us anything.
Joanna.

38:09.440 --> 38:10.480
Hepworth.

38:11.640 --> 38:14.040
When did he ring you?
The husband?

38:14.040 --> 38:16.720
Er, last night.
Gone half past eight.

38:16.720 --> 38:18.600
And he was odd.

38:18.600 --> 38:20.600
Odd?
On the phone.

38:20.600 --> 38:23.080
He's always odd.
In what way?

38:23.080 --> 38:25.560
Just like... "I don't know why
I'm bothering ringing,

38:25.560 --> 38:27.800
"she's probably
just messing about."

38:27.800 --> 38:30.320
I don't think he believed me
that she wasn't with us.

38:30.320 --> 38:33.520
Anyway, I passed him on to Tim
because I can't be doing with him.

38:33.520 --> 38:36.640
He talks to me like something he's
trodden in. Yeah. He's... He's...

38:36.640 --> 38:37.680
You see...

38:38.840 --> 38:41.240
..they got married
when she was very young.

38:41.240 --> 38:44.320
He was a teacher at the school

38:44.320 --> 38:47.560
and she'd just started
her A-levels. Anyway,

38:47.560 --> 38:50.040
next thing, he's wanting her
to give it all up

38:50.040 --> 38:51.680
so that they can get married.
Which...

38:54.280 --> 38:57.680
I mean, we hoped
she'd get in at university.

38:57.680 --> 39:00.040
Well, they were very
persuasive, weren't they,

39:00.040 --> 39:01.480
that it was what they wanted.

39:01.480 --> 39:02.640
Yeah.

39:02.640 --> 39:04.520
Well, she was smitten with him.

39:04.520 --> 39:07.160
And of course, what we've
realised since is...

39:08.400 --> 39:09.800
..that he's a control freak.

39:10.880 --> 39:13.600
We've been cut from the
picture completely.

39:14.760 --> 39:17.080
We've hardly seen those
two little girls, have we?

39:17.080 --> 39:19.800
Since Poppy was born.

39:19.800 --> 39:22.320
And then she's had...

39:22.320 --> 39:24.880
..mental problems.

39:28.440 --> 39:30.640
Has she been on any medication?

39:30.640 --> 39:35.920
Yeah, she was on medication
for anxiety - diazepam.

39:35.920 --> 39:38.080
Only he wouldn't let her take 'em.

39:39.240 --> 39:44.640
What do you mean? Well, she'd ring,
once a flood, usually in tears.

39:44.640 --> 39:45.840
And, yeah, he'd...

39:47.160 --> 39:48.760
He'd flushed them down the toilet.

39:50.680 --> 39:54.040
If anything bad has happened to her,

39:54.040 --> 39:55.240
it's him that's done it.

40:01.000 --> 40:02.960
Do you think
that's a possibility?

40:04.120 --> 40:08.200
I'd just be amazed, you know,
for all her...her problems...

40:09.680 --> 40:12.920
..I'd be amazed if
she left them two little girls.

40:12.920 --> 40:17.000
This is a fella that keeps
a padlock on the fridge.

40:22.360 --> 40:24.680
I just have one more question,

40:24.680 --> 40:26.800
and I'm sorry
if this seems insensitive.

40:26.800 --> 40:30.080
But do you know if it's possible

40:30.080 --> 40:32.000
that she may be seeing someone else?

40:33.920 --> 40:36.120
No. I don't...

40:36.120 --> 40:37.400
No. No.

40:38.320 --> 40:40.040
Not that I'm aware of.

40:46.520 --> 40:48.040
Don't look at me like that.

40:48.040 --> 40:50.160
Am I misunderstanding
the problem?

40:50.160 --> 40:52.400
No, I doubt it.
It's not complicated.

40:52.400 --> 40:54.600
It's the solution
that's complicated.

40:54.600 --> 40:58.000
She said... She said
she don't want a leaving do,

40:58.000 --> 41:01.000
but you're worried that if you don't
organise something, she'll sulk?

41:01.000 --> 41:04.640
Well, no. I mean, she can sulk
till the cows come home

41:04.640 --> 41:07.040
as far as I'm concerned,
because I have tried.

41:07.040 --> 41:10.120
The problem, if you'll pin back
your Jodrells, is

41:10.120 --> 41:12.520
I have been doing a whip-round

41:12.520 --> 41:15.560
and I've been doing it
for weeks, and I have raised

41:15.560 --> 41:18.080
£2,000.
How much?

41:18.080 --> 41:21.560
£2,175 and sixpence.

41:21.560 --> 41:23.400
For her? Yeah.

41:23.400 --> 41:24.880
Who's given you sixpence?

41:24.880 --> 41:27.320
Well, I don't know, folk have
just put their loose change in.

41:27.320 --> 41:29.880
I've had a little box
on the counter on reception.

41:29.880 --> 41:32.720
You've done what?
Well, she's very popular.

41:32.720 --> 41:35.800
People she's arrested
have been in donating.

41:35.800 --> 41:38.120
Well, not all of them, obviously,

41:38.120 --> 41:39.640
cos some of them
are still in prison.

41:39.640 --> 41:42.880
What are you going to buy her?
An island in the Caribbean?

41:42.880 --> 41:44.800
Well, this is the thing.

41:46.000 --> 41:49.240
Do I just slip her an envelope
with the cash in,

41:49.240 --> 41:51.480
like nudge, nudge, wink,
wink, like I'm buying

41:51.480 --> 41:53.040
some skunk off her?

41:53.040 --> 41:56.240
Or do we buy something nice

41:56.240 --> 41:59.840
and have, like, a low-key
presentation on Thursday,

41:59.840 --> 42:03.200
and, like, a few well-chosen
words from you,

42:03.200 --> 42:05.360
in here, and happen a cake?

42:05.360 --> 42:08.840
Or do we organise
a big proper do?

42:10.040 --> 42:11.560
And if she doesn't turn up,

42:11.560 --> 42:13.600
then we just get pissed
without her

42:13.600 --> 42:16.200
and I'll drop the money off
at a later date

42:16.200 --> 42:18.280
when I've recovered
from the hangover.

42:18.280 --> 42:20.680
I don't know. Ask someone
else. Ask Ann Gallagher.

42:20.680 --> 42:22.160
She's thick as thieves with her.

42:22.160 --> 42:24.000
Well, I've asked everyone else,
but...

42:25.840 --> 42:27.240
Er, woman I nicked

42:27.240 --> 42:29.720
for possession of controlled
drugs last week

42:29.720 --> 42:31.720
has just been reported
missing by her parents.

42:31.720 --> 42:34.200
They're downstairs and they've got
the same suspicions

42:34.200 --> 42:36.920
about the husband as I had when I
nicked her. What suspicions?

42:36.920 --> 42:39.000
Coercive control,
psychological abuse.

42:39.000 --> 42:41.520
She's only been missing
since yesterday morning,

42:41.520 --> 42:43.640
but we only have the husband's word
for that.

42:43.640 --> 42:44.920
It was him that rang earlier.

42:44.920 --> 42:47.120
They think she could have
been missing a lot longer.

42:47.120 --> 42:49.280
So I'd like to elevate it
to the Mispers unit.

42:49.280 --> 42:52.120
Bit soon to regard her
as missing if it's only been...

42:52.120 --> 42:54.480
She's an addict.
She's vulnerable.

42:54.480 --> 42:57.000
Her mum and dad have rung
around family and friends.

42:57.000 --> 42:59.240
I can double-check with
the hospitals and her GP,

42:59.240 --> 43:02.360
but she has also failed to answer
a number of phone calls

43:02.360 --> 43:04.080
from me regarding her bail.

43:04.080 --> 43:07.200
And she's got two little girls
that she's abandoned,

43:07.200 --> 43:09.360
which her mother insists
she would never do.

43:09.360 --> 43:11.240
Can I send Sledge
knocking on a few doors

43:11.240 --> 43:13.960
down their road? And then I'd
like to be submitting a report

43:13.960 --> 43:17.640
to Mispers with the enquiries
that we've already made.

43:18.640 --> 43:21.120
I know this fella.
It's Ryan's games teacher.

43:21.120 --> 43:23.920
There's definitely something
funny about him. Sorry.

43:23.920 --> 43:26.520
This is the fella that rang you
just before?

43:26.520 --> 43:28.680
Yeah, but only because
he heard a message

43:28.680 --> 43:30.960
I left yesterday on their
answer machine at home,

43:30.960 --> 43:33.520
asking for the wife to come in
to see me. So suddenly...

43:33.520 --> 43:35.400
..he realises the police

43:35.400 --> 43:36.720
might be knocking on his door,

43:36.720 --> 43:40.400
so he thinks he better start
looking like he's interested.

43:40.400 --> 43:42.120
Mike Taylor.

43:42.120 --> 43:43.760
Oh, yeah.

43:43.760 --> 43:46.520
Fantastic. Thank you.

43:46.520 --> 43:48.240
Cheers. Ta-ta.

43:48.240 --> 43:51.000
Tommy Lee Royce safely delivered
to Leeds Crown Court.

43:51.000 --> 43:53.440
His convoy has just arrived
and he's inside the building.

45:08.040 --> 45:10.080
Court 3. Quarter past 11.

45:13.240 --> 45:15.400
Come on.

45:32.640 --> 45:34.640
Ah.

45:34.640 --> 45:36.160
I'd better take this.

45:41.960 --> 45:44.360
- Hello?
- Is that Mr Hepworth?

45:44.360 --> 45:49.120
Rob Hepworth? It is. This is DC
Chris Hayes from Yorkshire Police

45:49.120 --> 45:50.840
Missing Persons Unit.

45:50.840 --> 45:53.480
I've just received a missing
persons report from Division

45:53.480 --> 45:55.520
regarding a Joanna May Hepworth.

45:55.520 --> 45:58.280
Are you her husband?
I am, yes.

45:58.280 --> 46:00.960
I need to speak to you
as soon as, Mr Hepworth.

46:02.120 --> 46:04.600
Could I meet you at your
address in half an hour?

46:04.600 --> 46:07.520
Half an hour? I'm at work.
Well, time is of the essence

46:07.520 --> 46:10.040
when someone's reported
missing, Mr Hepworth.

46:10.040 --> 46:13.440
Er, who's reported her
missing, anyway? Because I haven't.

46:13.440 --> 46:15.200
Do you know where she is?

46:15.200 --> 46:17.760
Well, no, but she's not missing.

46:17.760 --> 46:19.320
She's just...

46:19.320 --> 46:20.480
..gone off somewhere.

46:21.600 --> 46:23.720
But you don't know where?

46:23.720 --> 46:26.320
So I'd like to speak to you
at your address

46:26.320 --> 46:28.280
in half an hour.

46:28.280 --> 46:30.000
I believe you're
a schoolteacher?

46:30.000 --> 46:32.160
Would it help if I spoke
to your head teacher

46:32.160 --> 46:35.360
if you're worried
about leaving work? No, no.

46:35.360 --> 46:37.920
No, I can...
I'll sort something out.

46:37.920 --> 46:40.360
What was your name again?

47:47.040 --> 47:48.680
The court will rise.

48:59.760 --> 49:03.320
You know, I hope when she turns up
tomorrow or the day after,

49:03.320 --> 49:05.280
or probably just even
later on this afternoon,

49:05.280 --> 49:07.440
nobody's going to accuse me
of wasting police time.

49:12.640 --> 49:14.840
Come in!
Thank you.

49:16.080 --> 49:20.440
It's true that I thought she
didn't need to see a doctor.

49:20.440 --> 49:23.560
I didn't think she really
needed medication.

49:24.680 --> 49:26.320
I think too many people
take medication

49:26.320 --> 49:28.080
for self-diagnosed
mental health issues

49:28.080 --> 49:30.800
when all they really need to do is
get out the door and go for a run.

49:32.080 --> 49:35.080
But...having said that...

49:36.200 --> 49:37.480
..more recently...

49:39.920 --> 49:42.080
..I have started to wonder
if there was something

49:42.080 --> 49:43.560
more serious going on with her.

49:44.800 --> 49:49.160
You know, like, it's not just
anxiety or depression, but...

49:49.160 --> 49:51.560
..some kind of...

49:53.320 --> 49:56.040
..borderline personality disorder?

49:56.040 --> 50:00.960
It's like she just can't engage
with the real world.

50:00.960 --> 50:03.360
Is it all right with you
if I take a look around?

50:05.200 --> 50:06.840
What would you do if I said no?

50:06.840 --> 50:08.640
I'd have to come back with
a warrant.

50:08.640 --> 50:11.360
Help yourself. If you tell me
what you're looking for,

50:11.360 --> 50:14.360
I might be able to help you.
Oh, anything - notes, receipts,

50:14.360 --> 50:18.640
anything that could indicate that
she was planning to leave.

50:18.640 --> 50:21.080
You won't find anything.
I've looked.

50:22.280 --> 50:25.360
Also, she hasn't taken
her charger.

50:25.360 --> 50:26.960
For her mobile.

50:27.960 --> 50:30.840
She hasn't taken
her toothbrush either.

50:30.840 --> 50:32.560
But her mobile phone's gone?

50:32.560 --> 50:34.520
Well, certainly, I've not
come across it.

50:34.520 --> 50:36.800
Do you know if any of
her clothes are missing?

50:40.240 --> 50:42.640
There might be things
missing, but I wouldn't know.

50:42.640 --> 50:44.640
What was she wearing when
you last saw her?

50:46.120 --> 50:47.600
T-shirt and knickers.

50:47.600 --> 50:48.960
She was in bed.

50:48.960 --> 50:50.440
And where are those items now?

50:59.320 --> 51:00.720
She was wearing this.

51:04.160 --> 51:07.080
Your Honour, had this case
been known at the time

51:07.080 --> 51:10.920
my client's earlier sentence
was passed in 2014,

51:10.920 --> 51:14.120
then it may be that the court
would have been persuaded

51:14.120 --> 51:15.840
to order it to run concurrently

51:15.840 --> 51:18.360
with the sentences imposed
on that occasion.

51:19.680 --> 51:22.040
So I would ask that, bearing
in mind that the offences

51:22.040 --> 51:24.400
were committed around
the same time

51:24.400 --> 51:27.880
and whilst the defendant was under
the same influences,

51:27.880 --> 51:31.000
that Your Honour takes
a similar view

51:31.000 --> 51:33.320
in light of the totality of sentence

51:33.320 --> 51:34.760
that he already has to serve...

51:37.600 --> 51:40.080
So this afternoon,

51:40.080 --> 51:42.520
I'll access her mobile account
and look for any activity

51:42.520 --> 51:44.600
on her phone. I'll look at
her bank account

51:44.600 --> 51:47.040
and see if there's been
any activity there,

51:47.040 --> 51:49.800
and I'll look at her
Facebook account, too.

51:49.800 --> 51:51.720
What about, er, Twitter?

51:51.720 --> 51:54.120
Anything like that?
Any WhatsApp groups?

51:54.120 --> 51:56.680
No, just Facebook,
as far as I know.

51:56.680 --> 51:59.000
And I'm not sure
she keeps up with that.

51:59.000 --> 52:00.680
Ah, OK.

52:00.680 --> 52:03.800
One last one. Can I have a look
in the garage?

52:21.480 --> 52:24.480
Do you have any luggage,
suitcases, backpacks missing?

52:24.480 --> 52:26.880
No, not that I've noticed.

52:26.880 --> 52:30.520
Does Joanna use the gym stuff?
Er, no, that's me.

52:40.320 --> 52:42.960
What you looking at?
Looking at me?

52:42.960 --> 52:45.000
What? No.

52:45.000 --> 52:46.320
I know you.

52:46.320 --> 52:47.840
No, you don't. Yeah.

52:48.920 --> 52:51.480
You're the nonce
that fucks his own sister.

52:51.480 --> 52:53.040
You what?

53:45.800 --> 53:47.200
Hey! Come on!

53:56.720 --> 53:57.920
What's that?

53:57.920 --> 53:59.280
Go take a look.

54:02.840 --> 54:05.160
We need more security in here!

54:17.520 --> 54:19.600
Somebody stop him!
Do something!

54:22.600 --> 54:25.200
Lock down.
Lock down the building.

54:26.840 --> 54:29.920
Stop him!
Stop him!

54:31.960 --> 54:33.680
Christ's sake, Ryan.

54:36.040 --> 54:37.520
Police!

54:37.520 --> 54:39.800
Police, move!

54:47.200 --> 54:48.280
Unlock the doors!

54:55.360 --> 54:57.520
All units, send backup now!

55:32.040 --> 55:33.800
Come on.

56:14.920 --> 56:16.600
..Escaped from the dock.

56:16.600 --> 56:19.360
Suspect is Tommy Lee Royce,
36 years old...

56:26.720 --> 56:28.640
All units apply
maximum caution.

56:28.640 --> 56:31.880
Royce is extremely violent,
possible access to firearms.

56:33.600 --> 56:36.160
# In this trouble town

56:36.160 --> 56:38.880
# Troubles I've found

56:42.240 --> 56:44.840
# In this trouble town

56:44.840 --> 56:47.720
# Word soon gets 'round

56:54.200 --> 56:56.400
# Stuck in speed bump city

56:56.400 --> 57:01.200
# Where the only thing that's pretty
is the thought of getting out. #
