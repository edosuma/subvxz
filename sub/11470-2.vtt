00:00.100 --> 00:01.823
Frank: Previously on "Manhattan"...

00:01.843 --> 00:04.797
- We're waging a war of ideas.
- You're building an atomic bomb.

00:04.817 --> 00:06.379
We prefer to call it a gadget.

00:06.399 --> 00:09.358
Liza: We made a deal when we came here.
You would never lie to me.

00:09.378 --> 00:11.793
- I'm protecting our family.
- From what?

00:11.813 --> 00:14.616
- They are reading our mail.
- What?

00:14.636 --> 00:17.996
Dot: The children have head lice
and they are reading our mail.

00:18.016 --> 00:20.151
Everything is a secret!

00:20.186 --> 00:23.204
Glen: The army still hasn't decided
which design they're gonna back yet.

00:23.224 --> 00:25.790
Before they do,
we need to prove how much time

00:25.824 --> 00:28.126
our model is gonna save them.

00:28.161 --> 00:29.776
- 12 days?
- 12 weeks!

00:29.796 --> 00:31.265
Your group's going to be dissolved, Frank.

00:31.285 --> 00:33.297
I just handed you 8,000 lives.

00:33.317 --> 00:34.678
The army believes in the thin man.

00:34.698 --> 00:37.102
- Are you familiar with the espionage act?
- Espionage?

00:37.136 --> 00:39.487
- Frank, I screwed up.
- What the hell did you do?

00:39.507 --> 00:42.107
Cox: One of your boys stole
classified files. I'd like a name.

00:42.141 --> 00:44.609
You think I'd horse- trade
a member of my own team?

00:44.643 --> 00:46.841
We sacrifice the few to save the many.

00:46.861 --> 00:48.567
(Screaming)

00:51.383 --> 00:54.452
(Wind howling)

01:21.404 --> 01:23.948
Be... be just a minute.

01:29.222 --> 01:31.269
(Knocking)

01:47.706 --> 01:49.333
Sorry.

01:49.659 --> 01:52.808
- (Music playing on radio)
- (Sizzling)

02:01.590 --> 02:03.762
Man: You taking a bubble bath in there?

02:07.128 --> 02:10.959
"Population: 531,818.

02:10.979 --> 02:15.433
Official state nickname:
The land of enchantment.

02:17.977 --> 02:21.339
We'll take a small check, sweetheart.

02:27.880 --> 02:29.861
(Vehicle approaches)

02:29.881 --> 02:31.582
Let me ask you something.

02:31.617 --> 02:33.618
What kind of grown man

02:33.652 --> 02:35.797
can't drive a car?

02:36.622 --> 02:39.123
Are you amish or something?

02:40.226 --> 02:43.295
- I'm from Brooklyn.
- Oh, yeah?

02:43.329 --> 02:45.162
Do the Dodgers go the distance this year

02:45.197 --> 02:47.499
with Reiser overseas killing japs?

02:47.533 --> 02:51.168
(Music continues on radio)

02:59.078 --> 03:01.546
You know,
they ought to put you on the radio.

03:02.173 --> 03:04.267
You're a regular Jack Benny.

03:04.287 --> 03:07.285
I'll have a better conversation
driving home by myself.

03:10.789 --> 03:13.558
I'm riding back with you.

03:13.592 --> 03:16.228
We're just making a delivery.

03:23.726 --> 03:26.472
Them must be some oranges.

03:26.492 --> 03:29.474
(Music playing on radio)

03:45.858 --> 03:47.892
Cabby: So, uh...

03:47.926 --> 03:51.195
That crate of yours...
must be money, huh?

03:51.229 --> 03:54.432
- Or diamonds?
- Man #2: Pull over.

03:59.771 --> 04:00.945
(Music stops)

04:00.965 --> 04:04.644
You got a nervous bladder or something?
We just stopped 30 minutes ago.

04:04.664 --> 04:09.146
- I'll be back in a couple of hours.
- You've gotta be kidding me.

04:12.221 --> 04:13.485
Here.

04:14.529 --> 04:16.216
Collateral.

04:17.607 --> 04:19.656
Hey...

04:19.690 --> 04:22.294
We've been riding together for two days.

04:22.328 --> 04:24.862
You're really not gonna tell
me what you got in there?

04:26.465 --> 04:28.966
You ever hear of Pandora's box?

04:32.667 --> 04:35.173
Keep the meter running.

04:45.306 --> 04:47.676

04:51.585 --> 04:53.625
- (Applause)
- Much obliged for the grease.

04:53.659 --> 04:54.726
(Laughter)

04:54.760 --> 04:56.802
I wasn't always made of tin.

04:56.822 --> 05:00.131
Once I was flesh and blood as you are.

05:00.910 --> 05:02.767
Dorothy: How did it happen?

05:02.801 --> 05:05.076
(Giggles) Ahem.

05:05.504 --> 05:07.072
Shh.

05:07.694 --> 05:09.395
Tin man: And...

05:10.238 --> 05:14.045
The wi... wicked witch enchanted my axe

05:14.079 --> 05:17.248
so that it slipped and cut off my leg.

05:17.283 --> 05:20.618
I went to the tinsmith
and had a new one made.

05:20.653 --> 05:22.830
- Where's Liao?
- Mmm.

05:22.850 --> 05:26.454
One by one, I lost my arms,
my head, and my body.

05:26.474 --> 05:29.383
But the tinsmith replaced
each missing member.

05:29.403 --> 05:30.363
(Audience giggles)

05:30.383 --> 05:33.540
I was happy, notwithstanding,
until I discovered

05:33.560 --> 05:36.519
that I no longer loved my Cynthia.

05:36.539 --> 05:40.238
The tinsmith had forgotten
to give me a heart.

05:40.272 --> 05:43.174
Are you a man or a hardware store?

05:43.209 --> 05:45.423
Why do you stand so still?

05:45.443 --> 05:47.626
- I am rusting.
- Where?

05:47.646 --> 05:49.529
In my joints.

05:49.549 --> 05:51.398
(Play continues muffled)

06:02.258 --> 06:05.129
- I prefer the original.
- That was the original.

06:05.163 --> 06:06.998
The picture came... Charlie!

06:07.033 --> 06:09.734
Well, Phyllis plotzer ain't no
Judy Garland.

06:11.203 --> 06:14.038
You know,
Judy Garland ain't no Judy Garland.

06:14.072 --> 06:16.341
Her real name is frances Ethel Gumm.

06:16.375 --> 06:18.509
You ought to work for J. Edgar Hoover.

06:18.544 --> 06:21.813
Maybe then I'd know all your deep,
dark secrets.

06:21.847 --> 06:24.114
You remember that night you dragged me

06:24.149 --> 06:26.884
to that dance at your country club?

06:26.918 --> 06:29.220
I remember I couldn't get the grass stains

06:29.255 --> 06:31.122
out of my Schiaparelli dress.

06:31.157 --> 06:33.224
- Charl...
- Oh, yeah?

06:33.258 --> 06:35.326
No grass in the desert.

06:45.103 --> 06:47.138
Liza: Sid Liao must be in sorry shape

06:47.172 --> 06:50.074
to miss meeks's Broadway debut.

06:50.108 --> 06:53.711
He drank more than I did at the party.

06:53.981 --> 06:55.680
Helen.

06:57.883 --> 06:59.350
Good night.

07:01.026 --> 07:04.556
I just got back from the tech area.

07:05.580 --> 07:07.225
We're not getting any.

07:13.770 --> 07:16.723
Man: Last evening in Dr. Oppenheimer's
absence,

07:16.743 --> 07:21.138
I took possession of a care
package from the med lab at Chicago.

07:21.172 --> 07:24.208
The package travelled
1,200 miles to be here.

07:24.242 --> 07:27.419
Its contents had a
somewhat longer journey.

07:27.439 --> 07:31.849
It waited six billion years
to be midwifed into existence.

07:31.883 --> 07:33.518
And, for my American colleagues,

07:33.552 --> 07:36.687
it was named after the God of the dead,

07:36.722 --> 07:39.189
not Mickey Mouse's dog.

07:39.224 --> 07:44.629
It's the most valuable
substance on the planet.

07:46.693 --> 07:48.699
Behold, gentlemen.

07:49.391 --> 07:52.637
150 micrograms

07:52.671 --> 07:56.006
of Plutonium-239

07:56.041 --> 07:59.032
right here in our humble laboratory.

07:59.052 --> 08:02.693
One one-hundredth the mass of an eyelash.

08:02.713 --> 08:06.825
This sample is at Dr. Akley's disposal.

08:07.135 --> 08:09.821
Although our colleagues at
Chicago expect it returned,

08:09.855 --> 08:12.924
so don't dispose of it.

08:13.233 --> 08:15.460
The Phoenix rises from the ashes.

08:15.494 --> 08:17.695
But not early enough to
make an 8:00 a.m. meeting.

08:17.730 --> 08:21.499
I wasn't invited.
(Briefcase thuds)

08:21.533 --> 08:23.868
Thin man is our priority.

08:23.902 --> 08:26.634
What's the point of keeping my group alive
if you're just gonna starve us to death?

08:26.654 --> 08:29.153
10 micrograms, that's all I'm asking.
It's nothing.

08:29.173 --> 08:31.902
- The kingdom fell for want of a nail.
- What the hell does that mean?

08:31.922 --> 08:33.778
For want of a nail, the shoe was lost.

08:33.812 --> 08:35.246
For want of a shoe, the horse was lost.

08:35.280 --> 08:36.748
- For want of a horse...
- All right.

08:36.782 --> 08:38.582
Then the horseman.
Then the battle. It's a problem.

08:38.616 --> 08:40.251
Respectfully, Dr. barath, I need plutonium,

08:40.285 --> 08:42.219
not Hungarian folk wisdom.

08:42.254 --> 08:44.889
American. Your Benjamin Franklin.

08:44.923 --> 08:46.524
He has another.

08:46.559 --> 08:49.160
Necessity never made a good bargain.

08:49.195 --> 08:52.297
Dr. Oppenheimer dismantled
your implosion group, Frank,

08:52.331 --> 08:54.799
but evidently you reached some
sort of arrangement with the army.

08:54.833 --> 08:57.435
- Alek...
- the army is a powerful ally.

08:57.469 --> 09:00.070
It controls the money, the guns,
and the only road out of here.

09:00.105 --> 09:02.807
What the army does not control

09:02.841 --> 09:05.577
is 150 micrograms of a substance

09:05.611 --> 09:08.946
they had never heard of until
we told them it existed.

09:08.980 --> 09:11.254
That belongs to Robert Oppenheimer.

09:18.356 --> 09:20.758
(Music playing)

09:27.265 --> 09:30.935
(Woman singing in Portuguese)

09:43.849 --> 09:47.084
(Fire crackling)

09:53.091 --> 09:55.993
(Coughing)

10:04.339 --> 10:06.671
(Screams) No!

10:08.641 --> 10:10.108
No, no, no, no.

10:10.142 --> 10:11.909
(Abby screams)

10:11.943 --> 10:15.012
Fritz: It's 10:00 a.m., Crosley.
You ever heard of cirrhosis?

10:15.046 --> 10:16.914
My ancestors were Scottish kings.

10:16.948 --> 10:18.516
I have the liver of a Clydesdale.

10:18.550 --> 10:20.485
Amongst other vital organs.

10:20.519 --> 10:23.020
Maybe you'll break a leg. We can shoot you.

10:23.055 --> 10:25.090
- Ooh.
- It doesn't make any sense.

10:25.124 --> 10:27.358
First they fire us, then they rehire us?

10:27.392 --> 10:28.926
All except Liao, who's probably halfway

10:28.960 --> 10:30.761
to the university of Peking by now,
lucky bugger.

10:30.796 --> 10:32.830
No, he wouldn't leave without
saying good- bye.

10:32.898 --> 10:34.765
Look, Liao or no Liao,
we spent three months

10:34.800 --> 10:36.200
playing pin the tail on the neutron.

10:36.234 --> 10:38.469
The project finally gets its hands on...
how much?

10:38.504 --> 10:40.238
150 micrograms.

10:40.272 --> 10:42.840
Enough to prove that we're in the
right hemisphere and we get zero?

10:42.875 --> 10:45.209
(Conversation continues indistinctly)

10:45.880 --> 10:47.257
Sid?

10:51.617 --> 10:53.551
Thank you.

10:59.570 --> 11:01.526
No, that's not what I'm saying.

11:01.560 --> 11:03.764
I didn't realize today was a holiday.

11:16.808 --> 11:19.906
The coordinates of the secret facility
we're being transferred to now?

11:19.926 --> 11:23.326
American war dead as of this morning.

11:25.857 --> 11:29.520
Look, we can crunch numbers
until pigs join the Luftwaffe.

11:29.555 --> 11:31.856
- If we don't have any plutonium...
- We'll get it.

11:31.890 --> 11:34.125
From whom, Montgomery ward?

11:34.160 --> 11:36.193
Akley's gonna hand it over.

11:37.146 --> 11:39.305
He just doesn't know it yet.

11:51.476 --> 11:53.110
I think you killed it.

11:53.145 --> 11:54.976
(Sniffling)

11:59.050 --> 12:01.619
My grandmother tatted these curtains.

12:01.654 --> 12:03.921
They survived all the way from Russia.

12:03.956 --> 12:06.724
Well, that's no match for your
average Monday on the hill.

12:06.758 --> 12:08.292
Is this average?

12:08.326 --> 12:09.994
I put a pot of coffee on,

12:10.028 --> 12:12.829
the next thing I know,
the house is on fire.

12:13.151 --> 12:15.241
Let me help with that.

12:15.261 --> 12:16.734
Thank you.

12:20.069 --> 12:23.107
Dick Tracy just sat there watching, huh?

12:23.966 --> 12:25.643
The black coupe.

12:25.678 --> 12:27.428
He's G-2.

12:27.911 --> 12:31.683
Oh, don't worry.
They'll lose interest in a couple of weeks.

12:31.717 --> 12:34.586
Unless you slash their tires like I did.

12:35.183 --> 12:38.556
Someone should have warned
you about the stoves. They're lethal.

12:38.590 --> 12:41.231
We ought to ship them to Berlin.

12:44.329 --> 12:46.598
Does it get any easier?

12:49.167 --> 12:53.805
My father always said that
everything easy was hard first.

12:56.840 --> 12:59.421
We never got to the second part with him.

12:59.843 --> 13:01.912
You're gonna be fine.

13:01.947 --> 13:04.549
I'm not so sure about your curtains.

13:05.812 --> 13:07.051
Liza.

13:07.085 --> 13:10.355
Oh, Abigail. Abby Isaacs.

13:11.061 --> 13:12.302
Um...

13:12.322 --> 13:14.659
If we can't use the stove,

13:14.693 --> 13:17.228
how are we supposed to eat?

13:24.736 --> 13:26.604
What the hell are you doing?

13:26.638 --> 13:29.206
Putting my tax dollars to work.

13:29.241 --> 13:31.609
Your mom will be back in an hour.

13:33.344 --> 13:35.091
Oh!

13:48.393 --> 13:50.427
Where is he? Laundering shirts?

13:53.131 --> 13:55.166
The chinaman. Missing in action.

13:55.200 --> 13:57.167
Sid's under the weather.

14:10.048 --> 14:12.016
It's not good.

14:12.050 --> 14:13.685
The army is still holding him?

14:13.719 --> 14:16.654
They sent over some suit from Washington.

14:16.689 --> 14:18.956
Probably justice department.

14:18.990 --> 14:20.791
(Sighs)

14:21.997 --> 14:25.663
- They're gonna charge him with treason.
- Sid Liao is not a traitor.

14:25.698 --> 14:27.664
Just a stupid kid who made a mistake.

14:27.699 --> 14:31.086
Well, around here,
that's a distinction without a difference.

14:32.463 --> 14:34.806
I know that look.

14:36.248 --> 14:39.643
48 hours ago,
our group was on the chopping block.

14:39.677 --> 14:41.779
Now we're back in this office

14:41.813 --> 14:43.955
and sid Liao isn't.

14:45.350 --> 14:47.051
I'm not looking for an explanation.

14:47.085 --> 14:48.552
I'm just telling you how it is.

14:48.586 --> 14:50.555
You can't solve Sid's problem.

14:50.589 --> 14:52.657
They can't go around
picking off scientists.

14:52.691 --> 14:55.325
Frank, this thing is poison.

14:55.474 --> 14:58.378
You got to think about
the rest of the group.

15:46.578 --> 15:48.846
Sorry to keep you waiting.

15:55.318 --> 15:57.167
Who are you?

15:57.639 --> 16:00.865
Who I am is inconsequential.

16:00.885 --> 16:02.876
The question is who are you?

16:02.896 --> 16:04.568
I wanna talk to an attorney.

16:05.736 --> 16:07.237
Have you eaten?

16:08.483 --> 16:09.811
Okay, there are laws.

16:09.831 --> 16:11.858
This isn't Moscow. This is new Mexico.

16:11.878 --> 16:14.610
It's my constitutional
right as a citizen...

16:14.645 --> 16:16.980
Actually, it isn't new Mexico.

16:17.014 --> 16:19.749
Within the confines of these fences,

16:19.783 --> 16:22.685
you are no longer in the United States

16:22.720 --> 16:25.313
or the purview of its constitution.

16:25.333 --> 16:29.025
Technically,
you are nowhere talking to no one.

16:30.342 --> 16:32.104
Now, how about a sandwich?

16:32.124 --> 16:35.698
Look, there's been a mix- up.
I took some papers, I admit that,

16:35.718 --> 16:37.696
but they pose no threat to security.

16:37.716 --> 16:40.696
They involve x-rays,
high-speed photography.

16:40.716 --> 16:42.473
It was my own research.

16:42.507 --> 16:45.175
I thought I could license the findings.

16:45.209 --> 16:47.174
- It was stupid.
- To whom?

16:47.509 --> 16:50.146
You were planning to sell military secrets.

16:51.158 --> 16:52.883
I'm not a spy.

16:52.917 --> 16:55.519
Jesus, I was gonna call eastman Kodak.

16:55.553 --> 16:57.469
(Laughs)

16:57.489 --> 16:59.856
You physicists...
you have a natural talent

16:59.891 --> 17:02.759
for splitting hairs.

17:02.794 --> 17:05.829
The world I live in is
much more black and white.

17:07.064 --> 17:08.699
Pss, pss, pss, pss.

17:08.733 --> 17:11.534
(Clicking tongue) Poor thing.

17:11.569 --> 17:14.104
Stranded in the desert.

17:15.193 --> 17:17.272
Remind me which one of you wunderkinds

17:17.308 --> 17:19.797
came up with the theory of the cat.

17:22.079 --> 17:23.646
Uh, Erwin Schrodinger.

17:23.681 --> 17:25.115
Schrodinger, yes.

17:25.148 --> 17:26.883
I read about him in "Popular Science."

17:26.917 --> 17:29.319
A cat is locked in a steel chamber

17:29.353 --> 17:31.121
with a bottle of cyanide.

17:31.155 --> 17:33.757
It's either been poisoned or it hasn't.

17:33.792 --> 17:35.726
But...(Laughs)

17:35.760 --> 17:38.394
...until you look inside the chamber,

17:38.429 --> 17:42.366
the cat is both dead and
alive simultaneously.

17:43.635 --> 17:45.235
How do you explain that?

17:47.285 --> 17:49.406
- It's complicated.
- Is it?

17:50.808 --> 17:52.843
The question seems simple enough to me.

17:52.877 --> 17:54.945
Is he alive or is he dead?

17:55.564 --> 17:58.882
Maybe it depends on what the cat does next.

18:08.359 --> 18:11.928
Soldier: "You are the best and
bravest son a mother could hope for.

18:11.963 --> 18:15.666
I think of your valor on that beachhead

18:15.700 --> 18:18.135
and my heart fills to bursting.

18:18.469 --> 18:20.503
When you're down in the trenches

18:20.538 --> 18:22.539
and the bullets are flying..."

18:22.574 --> 18:24.475
(music playing on radio)

18:24.509 --> 18:27.210
(Men laughing)

18:27.495 --> 18:29.721
Lying to your own mother?

18:29.741 --> 18:31.381
What am I supposed to say?

18:31.415 --> 18:33.617
Today I held the door for some egghead?

18:33.651 --> 18:36.052
I haven't fired a gun
since we left Fort Dix.

18:36.087 --> 18:38.855
War is hell.

18:39.021 --> 18:40.357
Frank: We had an arrangement.

18:40.377 --> 18:41.892
You said you would protect Sid Liao.

18:41.926 --> 18:44.594
I said I'd put in a good word
with the powers that be and I did.

18:44.628 --> 18:46.964
- I want to see him now.
- That's not possible.

18:46.998 --> 18:49.466
Your group is intact.
You got what you asked for.

18:49.500 --> 18:51.369
Now you've got a guilty conscience?

18:52.804 --> 18:55.472
Outside parties have taken
an interest in your man.

18:55.506 --> 18:57.174
The department of justice?

18:57.208 --> 18:59.042
It's no longer my concern.

18:59.077 --> 19:01.177
Is that a piece of costume
jewelry on your chest?

19:01.212 --> 19:03.280
- Excuse me?
- You're the high-ranking military officer

19:03.314 --> 19:04.915
on this base...
O-6.

19:04.949 --> 19:07.017
If you weren't here,
you'd be in a tent in the pacific

19:07.051 --> 19:08.651
with 4,000 lives at your command.

19:08.686 --> 19:10.220
We all have to make sacrifices.

19:10.254 --> 19:12.389
On this hill you are the powers that be,

19:12.424 --> 19:15.559
so stop acting like a guest
in your own goddamn house.

19:18.963 --> 19:20.964
So that's our girl.

19:20.998 --> 19:23.533
The isotope that launched 1,000 ships.

19:23.567 --> 19:25.769
Hope the brits have good umbrellas.

19:25.803 --> 19:28.194
It's gonna be raining
Nazis in piccadilly circus.

19:29.207 --> 19:30.941
Hi, Charlie.

19:30.975 --> 19:33.210
Settling in all right?

19:34.412 --> 19:36.046
Some of the boys have been telling me

19:36.080 --> 19:38.957
you've been talking a blue
streak about civilian casualties.

19:39.884 --> 19:41.517
You know, you got anything on your mind,

19:41.552 --> 19:43.187
my door is always open.

19:45.657 --> 19:48.337
Well, sir, respectfully,

19:49.093 --> 19:52.501
we got some of the best minds in
America here, maybe the world.

19:52.521 --> 19:56.033
If we redirected our efforts
towards particle beams

19:56.067 --> 19:58.501
or sonar, anti- submarine technology,
we could potentially...

19:58.536 --> 20:00.398
- Charlie.
- Yeah?

20:00.418 --> 20:02.405
I want you to be happy here.

20:02.595 --> 20:05.408
- Thank you.
- But I need you to be helpful.

20:07.335 --> 20:09.513
You are a gear in a complex machine

20:09.547 --> 20:11.014
with 1,000 moving parts.

20:11.049 --> 20:12.741
- I understand that.
- We cherish life.

20:12.761 --> 20:14.789
It's in our nature.

20:15.434 --> 20:17.620
Unfortunately, our enemies do not.

20:19.281 --> 20:23.960
Doubt is a luxury we cannot afford.

20:32.536 --> 20:36.206
Sorry, how are sanitary
napkins gonna fix my stove?

20:36.598 --> 20:39.276
Okay, stay here.

20:39.310 --> 20:41.612
Keep an eye out for MP's.

20:44.702 --> 20:46.737
Liza: Hey, Nana.

20:53.490 --> 20:54.992
Liza: Muchas gracias.

20:58.149 --> 21:00.063
Okay, let's go.

21:00.097 --> 21:03.088
Now, this is Lophophora Williamsii.

21:04.102 --> 21:07.470
The natives say it glistens,
so they call it Peyote.

21:07.505 --> 21:09.472
It's a drug.

21:09.507 --> 21:12.776
- Oh, I don't even smoke.
- It's not for you.

21:12.810 --> 21:16.310
It's for tiny,
the fry cook at the mess hall.

21:16.580 --> 21:19.349
Abby, you need a hot plate.

21:19.383 --> 21:21.051
If you order it from the commissary,

21:21.085 --> 21:22.652
you'll get it after V-day.

21:22.686 --> 21:25.221
Tiny can give you one today.

21:26.457 --> 21:28.698
Just don't eat the change.

21:35.833 --> 21:37.541
Shit.

21:37.769 --> 21:40.403
Shit, shit, shit, shit.

21:40.437 --> 21:42.673
- Shit!
- You all right?

21:43.796 --> 21:45.609
Uh, yeah.

21:47.911 --> 21:49.267
Shit.

21:49.287 --> 21:51.910
You know, Einstein said the
definition of insanity is...

21:51.930 --> 21:55.941
Doing the same thing over and over again
expecting a different result, yeah.

21:56.511 --> 21:57.988
It wasn't Einstein, though.

21:58.022 --> 22:00.523
It was alcoholics anonymous.

22:02.626 --> 22:04.838
Anyway, you want insane?

22:05.049 --> 22:06.930
You should talk to me when I lose my job

22:06.965 --> 22:09.806
and I have to move back to
Perryville to live with my mother.

22:09.826 --> 22:11.377
Perryville?

22:11.397 --> 22:15.038
- Mm- hmm.
- I'm from Missouri.

22:15.385 --> 22:16.973
- Really?
- Yeah.

22:17.008 --> 22:21.077
Well, you, me, and the Pony Express.

22:22.262 --> 22:24.681
He's not coming back, is he?

22:24.716 --> 22:27.584
Lancefield? No, never works past 7:00.

22:27.619 --> 22:29.786
Protestant work ethic.

22:31.956 --> 22:35.369
I was supposed to pick
up the plutonium sample.

22:35.692 --> 22:38.594
Now I have to explain to my group
that we lost a good night's work

22:38.629 --> 22:41.317
because I was trying to
get a call through to my...

22:41.337 --> 22:43.399
my boyfriend.

22:43.695 --> 22:45.702
Let's be honest, my...

22:47.840 --> 22:49.706
my ex-boyfriend.

22:51.776 --> 22:55.212
They already think I'm a circus
act around here, you know?

22:55.540 --> 22:57.313
A girl with a PhD.

22:57.348 --> 23:01.118
That's like a monkey with a harmonica.

23:12.396 --> 23:13.563
(Sighs)

23:13.597 --> 23:15.632
There was a girl in my graduate class.

23:15.667 --> 23:18.234
She could solve lagrange
equations in her head.

23:18.269 --> 23:21.071
Really?
(Lighter clicks)

23:26.277 --> 23:29.279
- And where is she now?
- I don't know. Married.

23:31.149 --> 23:33.116
Right.

23:37.655 --> 23:39.690
You're not as...

23:39.724 --> 23:42.559
you're not as loathsome as
the rest of Akley's drones.

23:42.593 --> 23:45.328
- Oh, thank you.
- No, I mean, I...

23:45.709 --> 23:47.730
I read your paper.

23:48.116 --> 23:50.500
No offense, but...

23:50.534 --> 23:53.103
I thought you'd be an arrogant horse's ass.

24:03.013 --> 24:05.081
I'll give Missouri your best.

24:06.784 --> 24:08.790
Hey.

24:09.253 --> 24:11.979
I got keys to the lab. I can let you in.

24:12.103 --> 24:13.856
Really?

24:16.035 --> 24:17.487
(Clinking)

24:17.507 --> 24:20.663
First we precipitate plutonium fluoride.

24:21.383 --> 24:23.933
And then we fire up the cyclotron
and count the neutrons per fission.

24:23.967 --> 24:26.169
Meeks, what are you talking about?

24:26.203 --> 24:28.338
You know even less about chemistry
than you do about acting.

24:28.372 --> 24:31.108
It has no known effects
on human physiology.

24:31.142 --> 24:33.576
It was just discovered.
We don't know anything about it yet.

24:33.611 --> 24:36.446
We know plenty. It's a transuranic
radioactive chemical element

24:36.480 --> 24:39.149
with a high boiling point and
a half-life of 240,000 years.

24:39.183 --> 24:40.883
You mean 24,000.

24:40.918 --> 24:42.585
- What?
- Plutonium.

24:42.620 --> 24:44.921
- No, Kryptonite.
- Kryptonite.

24:46.057 --> 24:49.126
Fritz, Meeks, Charlie Isaacs.

24:49.160 --> 24:52.095
Oh. Let me ask you something.

24:52.130 --> 24:55.631
Suppose you had to estimate the
force of gravity on Krypton.

24:55.666 --> 24:57.667
Krypton, the fictitious planet?

24:57.701 --> 25:00.470
- Yeah.
- Yeah, just a ballpark figure.

25:05.476 --> 25:08.011
Okay. Um...

25:09.819 --> 25:12.615
They say Superman can leap a
tall building in a single bound.

25:12.650 --> 25:16.586
Yes, and you figure, what, the Chicago
board of trade building is 500 feet tall?

25:16.620 --> 25:19.956
And let's say an adult male in peak
physical condition can jump five feet.

25:19.991 --> 25:24.260
Stands to reason Krypton's gravity
is 100 times that of earth's.

25:24.295 --> 25:28.031
978 meters per seconds squared!

25:28.065 --> 25:30.700
- Thank you, Charlie.
- No, impossible.

25:30.734 --> 25:32.068
You know what's impossible?

25:32.103 --> 25:35.005
Either of you two ever
having sex with a woman.

25:35.039 --> 25:37.202
What the hell is going on in here?

25:51.291 --> 25:52.649
Would you like to explain yourself?

25:52.669 --> 25:54.793
What I would like is my
share of the plutonium.

25:54.827 --> 25:56.997
Your share. What, do you think
we're running a commune here?

25:57.017 --> 25:58.831
Perhaps I was insufficiently
clear yesterday.

25:58.866 --> 26:01.500
You refused to help me get the
resources I need to do my job.

26:01.534 --> 26:03.392
- So I helped myself.
- If there's so much

26:03.412 --> 26:05.652
- as a microgram missing...
- Dr. Akley is a competent manager.

26:05.672 --> 26:07.239
He may even deliver a working bomb.

26:07.274 --> 26:09.108
- I appreciate the vote of confidence.
- But that won't matter,

26:09.142 --> 26:13.211
because by the time he does,
New York will already be an ashtray.

26:13.524 --> 26:15.949
You studied with Heisenberg at Leipzig.

26:15.969 --> 26:19.324
Do you think we even have a prayer
of beating him with thin man?

26:19.521 --> 26:22.054
The implosion model is more efficient.

26:22.088 --> 26:23.256
It will save us time.

26:23.290 --> 26:25.090
We are building a better mousetrap.

26:25.124 --> 26:28.427
Let me ask you a question.
Did you study axial chemistry at Leipzig?

26:28.461 --> 26:30.962
No? What about the Clark effect?

26:32.208 --> 26:34.558
It's because they've never been proven.

26:34.578 --> 26:38.004
These are Frank Winter's contributions
to science... pipe dreams.

26:38.038 --> 26:40.406
Implosion is a fascinating theory,

26:40.440 --> 26:42.508
but you cannot drop a theory

26:42.542 --> 26:44.858
out of a lockheed B-29 Superfortress.

26:44.878 --> 26:46.478
Boeing.

26:46.936 --> 26:50.316
If Frank could prove that implosion
was more than a fairy tale

26:50.350 --> 26:52.084
even at the most rudimentary level,

26:52.118 --> 26:53.785
I'd give him all the plutonium he wants.

26:53.820 --> 26:55.287
He could have the keys to my Buick.

26:55.307 --> 26:57.756
He could sleep with my wife.

26:59.667 --> 27:01.159
Fine.

27:01.194 --> 27:02.995
- Fine what?
- I'll prove it.

27:04.643 --> 27:05.898
How?

27:14.241 --> 27:15.651
(Door slams)

27:15.775 --> 27:17.686
Get up.

27:20.547 --> 27:22.348
I want you to get the group together.

27:22.382 --> 27:24.228
Winter.

27:25.719 --> 27:27.765
I'm talking to you, asshole!

27:34.627 --> 27:36.795
Barath gave us 24 hours.

27:36.829 --> 27:39.965
They'll give us the plutonium if we
can prove that our design will work.

27:39.999 --> 27:41.534
We can't prove it'll
work without plutonium.

27:41.568 --> 27:43.034
Yes, we can.

27:43.069 --> 27:44.903
Jim: Well, we can walk them through
the math,

27:44.938 --> 27:46.572
but it doesn't actually prove anything.

27:46.606 --> 27:48.240
Before the Wright brothers
built their first plane,

27:48.275 --> 27:51.076
they flew kites off the
dunes of kitty hawk.

27:51.110 --> 27:52.745
This is a kite.

27:52.779 --> 27:54.480
I assume we're gonna blow
that up and not fly it.

27:54.514 --> 27:56.815
No, no, not up. In.

27:56.849 --> 27:59.818
Mechanically,
it is no different than the implosion bomb.

27:59.852 --> 28:03.322
It's just that we're gonna turn this...

28:04.591 --> 28:05.724
Into this.

28:05.758 --> 28:07.760
Oh, we're gonna turn it into a cigar.

28:10.096 --> 28:12.598
We're going to implode a pipe

28:12.632 --> 28:15.734
into a solid mass same size as that cigar.

28:15.769 --> 28:17.669
Wait, by tomorrow? That's absurd.

28:17.704 --> 28:19.705
What's the rush?

28:30.817 --> 28:32.902
Our friend from Washington,

28:32.922 --> 28:34.820
he's not department of justice.

28:34.854 --> 28:36.455
What is he, OSS?

28:36.489 --> 28:39.091
FBI? G-2?

28:39.125 --> 28:41.960
It's the ones that don't have a
name you have to look out for.

28:41.995 --> 28:43.896
We got a real problem here.

28:43.930 --> 28:46.131
I thought it was Liao's problem.

28:46.165 --> 28:48.367
There are dark corners in this war, Frank.

28:48.401 --> 28:51.237
Men like him,
they don't have an office or a title.

28:51.271 --> 28:53.639
He is just a line item on a budget.

28:53.673 --> 28:56.208
He makes problems disappear.

28:57.444 --> 28:59.445
He makes people disappear.

29:13.326 --> 29:15.561
I don't feel good.

29:15.595 --> 29:18.664
You want to hear it again,
put a nickel in the jukebox.

29:22.401 --> 29:24.436
You ever hear the expression

29:24.471 --> 29:27.430
"man is as sick as his secrets"?
(Handcuffs unlock)

29:28.875 --> 29:31.009
Look, I've already told you.

29:31.043 --> 29:34.613
Three weeks ago,
I took the papers back to the dorm room.

29:34.647 --> 29:36.982
I stuck them down the front of my pants.

29:37.016 --> 29:39.318
It was easy. They don't search you

29:39.352 --> 29:41.599
when you're leaving the tech area.

29:44.491 --> 29:46.992
I hid the papers under my mattress.

29:47.026 --> 29:50.062
I was going to sell the patents.
I'm not a spy.

29:50.097 --> 29:52.895
I've got a five-year-old kid.
She's got myeloma.

29:54.545 --> 29:57.156
I wish I could take it back, but I can't.

29:57.176 --> 29:59.745
You want me to put it in writing?

30:01.708 --> 30:03.809
Why don't we start from the beginning?

30:03.843 --> 30:07.291
Jesus Christ. It was three weeks ago...

30:07.911 --> 30:09.682
that's not the beginning. That's the end.

30:09.716 --> 30:11.817
What?! You want to know where I
was conceived?

30:11.851 --> 30:13.385
I assume it was in Bloomington, Indiana.

30:13.419 --> 30:14.720
That's where your parents met, right?

30:14.754 --> 30:17.089
Your mother was born Mary Agnes Costello.

30:17.124 --> 30:19.758
She died in 1938 in her bedroom, a stroke.

30:19.792 --> 30:23.061
Your father taught mathematics
at Shanghai University.

30:23.096 --> 30:25.764
Now he's washing dishes
at the Foxhead Steakhouse.

30:25.798 --> 30:28.667
He was raised in Soochow.

30:30.759 --> 30:33.067
But you've never been there, have you?

30:33.191 --> 30:34.842
No.

30:35.842 --> 30:38.177
They have the most marvelous gardens.

30:38.211 --> 30:41.347
Something to see before you die.

30:44.018 --> 30:46.611
Why are we here?

30:47.021 --> 30:50.098
Whatever you want to know, just ask me.

30:53.560 --> 30:56.428
You probably know from talking
to your daughter's oncologist,

30:56.463 --> 31:00.933
some cancers you can treat
with a course of radiation.

31:01.238 --> 31:04.870
Others you have to cut out at the source.

31:05.560 --> 31:07.105
You want to talk about my kid?

31:07.139 --> 31:10.802
I want to talk about your
colleagues in the tech area.

31:10.822 --> 31:12.525
You were recruited by Frank Winter.

31:12.545 --> 31:14.012
Let's talk about him.

31:14.047 --> 31:16.982
In 1936, he took a leave of absence

31:17.016 --> 31:18.316
from the university of Chicago.

31:18.351 --> 31:21.353
Do you know where he spent that year?

31:23.156 --> 31:26.058
- Why don't you ask Frank?
- Because I'm asking you.

31:29.596 --> 31:33.369
Three weeks ago,
I took the papers out of the tech area

31:33.389 --> 31:35.033
and hid them in my dorm room.

31:35.068 --> 31:38.253
I was going to sell the patents.
I am not a spy.

31:39.271 --> 31:41.430
If you want to charge me, have at it.

31:51.426 --> 31:53.895
I'll come back when you're feeling better.

31:56.946 --> 31:58.490
(Knocks)

31:58.524 --> 32:00.759
Try to get some rest.

32:21.950 --> 32:24.655
(Whooping, whistling)

32:26.085 --> 32:29.187
Yeah, boys, look at it.
I got Joseph Goebbels, boys.

32:29.222 --> 32:31.373
(Cheering)

32:35.428 --> 32:39.264
Sergeant, sir. Did you get my request?

32:39.298 --> 32:40.666
I put in for transfer, sir.

32:40.700 --> 32:42.148
For deployment overseas...
the pacific theater,

32:42.168 --> 32:43.769
europe, wherever I'm needed, sir.

32:43.803 --> 32:47.539
Gate C, 2200 hours.
You have the graveyard shift, private.

32:47.574 --> 32:50.743
Sir, due respect,
I want to see some action.

32:50.777 --> 32:53.545
Sergeant: So watch the RKO newsreel.

32:53.580 --> 32:56.749
At great expense,
your president gathered...

33:00.194 --> 33:02.688
It's all filled out. Sign the bottom line.

33:02.722 --> 33:04.103
Prove you're still in charge here.

33:04.123 --> 33:06.592
- What is this?
- It's what sid Liao deserves...

33:06.626 --> 33:08.744
a fighting chance.

33:17.611 --> 33:18.523
Who was the man?

33:18.543 --> 33:21.146
I could not recognize his voice,
so I connected the call.

33:21.389 --> 33:23.603
***

33:23.623 --> 33:25.338
(Laughs)

33:25.648 --> 33:27.415
- See you tomorrow.
- Bye.

33:27.435 --> 33:29.004
(Kisses) Bonsoir.

33:29.024 --> 33:30.652
(Abby shrieks)

33:30.686 --> 33:32.153
Abby: Are you ready to go?

33:32.188 --> 33:34.223
(Conversation continues indistinctly)

33:34.257 --> 33:36.675
(Abby giggles)
That tickles.

33:36.695 --> 33:38.767
- You need this, honey.
- Okay.

33:43.733 --> 33:46.374
No, no, no, no. We have to go. Yes.

33:46.394 --> 33:48.569
Charlie, please.

33:49.112 --> 33:51.177
You need to calm down.

33:51.197 --> 33:52.889
I told her we'd be there at 7:30.

33:52.909 --> 33:54.403
- Reschedule.
- No.

33:54.423 --> 33:56.377
After the day I had, all I want to do

33:56.412 --> 33:59.518
- is get into bed with my wife.
- Shh!

33:59.643 --> 34:00.815
I'll do that thing you like.

34:00.850 --> 34:02.717
Two nights in a row?
You'll sprain your back.

34:02.752 --> 34:06.120
- Besides, you have to eat.
- I'm not hungry.

34:06.652 --> 34:07.769
(Knocking)

34:07.789 --> 34:10.058
- Charlie: Who's that?
- The sitter.

34:11.060 --> 34:13.681
Look, just tell your new friend
or who ever she is...

34:13.701 --> 34:16.456
You met her the other
night at the barbecue.

34:17.304 --> 34:18.935
Hello. Come in.

34:18.955 --> 34:21.065
Charlie, this is Callie Winter.

34:23.224 --> 34:26.541
You're Frank Winter's daughter?

34:27.322 --> 34:30.246
- Ostensibly.
- Let me introduce you to Joey.

34:30.266 --> 34:32.347
Callie was sweet enough
to offer her services

34:32.380 --> 34:34.416
while we have dinner with her parents.

34:34.449 --> 34:38.409
You know what?
I am developing a bit of an appetite.

34:39.353 --> 34:41.690
(Music playing)

34:43.192 --> 34:45.893
Oh, and they have Tommy Dorsey.

34:45.928 --> 34:48.996
Oh, you might have to take me for a spin.

34:50.833 --> 34:53.668
We were just about to call a search party.

34:53.703 --> 34:57.138
- Hello.
- Frank, this is Abby Isaacs

34:57.172 --> 34:58.740
and her husband Charlie.

34:58.775 --> 35:02.110
- We've crossed paths at the office.
- Have we?

35:02.144 --> 35:04.437
Liza: They're staying for dinner.

35:10.107 --> 35:11.452
Who needs a drink?

35:11.472 --> 35:13.988
(Music blaring)

36:02.048 --> 36:04.853
I have all his albums back at home.

36:05.498 --> 36:07.595
He does have a lovely voice.

36:19.557 --> 36:21.389
Are you a jazz fan?

36:23.789 --> 36:25.651
I prefer silence.

36:26.085 --> 36:27.326
Mmm.

36:29.870 --> 36:32.333
Frank is very sensitive to noise.

36:32.368 --> 36:34.135
Is that right?

36:40.109 --> 36:41.776
Would anybody like dessert?

36:41.811 --> 36:43.873
I'll help you.

36:46.699 --> 36:48.895
- I can take this.
- Thank you.

36:56.369 --> 36:59.427
So what's your problem anyway?

37:00.067 --> 37:03.071
Just bulldoze anyone in your
path to get what you want?

37:10.358 --> 37:12.040
I figured it out.

37:12.074 --> 37:14.801
Why you were the one guy
that rejected my paper.

37:14.975 --> 37:16.611
I doubt that.

37:16.646 --> 37:19.711
You're afraid I'm the meteor
that'll make you go extinct.

37:22.863 --> 37:26.425
What is it with little boys and dinosaurs?

37:37.967 --> 37:40.068
Charlie's usually more fun.

37:40.515 --> 37:43.137
Physicists need to sniff each other out,

37:43.172 --> 37:44.906
mark their territory.

37:44.940 --> 37:47.508
You'd think there'd be
enough universe to go around.

37:47.543 --> 37:49.744
I don't know what's gotten
into him since we got here.

37:49.779 --> 37:52.489
Half the time he's brooding
and the other half...

37:55.790 --> 37:58.192
Honestly, it's like our honeymoon.

37:58.212 --> 38:01.252
He can't keep his hands to himself.

38:02.291 --> 38:04.756
They're all like that at first.

38:04.776 --> 38:07.469
They find it easier than talking.

38:08.230 --> 38:10.933
Eventually, they stop doing either.

38:21.710 --> 38:24.405
You know, when I was a kid...

38:24.425 --> 38:26.005
you mind?

38:26.025 --> 38:29.250
My father used to drag me with him

38:29.284 --> 38:32.251
when he played Mississippi stud.

38:32.271 --> 38:35.738
And sometime after dawn,
the guy would scoop me up off the sofa

38:35.758 --> 38:37.692
in the back of some delicatessen

38:37.727 --> 38:40.194
and he'd tell me that what mattered

38:40.229 --> 38:42.656
was that he had balls.

38:42.676 --> 38:46.503
See, because whatever kind of
beating he took at the table,

38:46.523 --> 38:48.536
he still thought he was a Maverick.

38:48.570 --> 38:49.871
Even after we'd lost the house,

38:49.906 --> 38:52.574
in his mind he was always
a genius card shark

38:52.608 --> 38:57.112
just waiting for that one lucky river card.

38:57.298 --> 39:01.082
But the most pathetic part isn't
that my father doubled down

39:01.116 --> 39:05.730
on the wrong bets over and over again,

39:05.750 --> 39:08.957
it's that he was never man
enough to admit to himself

39:08.991 --> 39:11.492
that he was a sinking ship.

39:15.412 --> 39:17.621
I don't feel bad for you.

39:18.738 --> 39:21.609
I feel bad for those suckers in your group

39:21.629 --> 39:23.938
that you're taking down with you.

39:25.544 --> 39:28.224
Come tomorrow, they'll be a punch line.

39:28.733 --> 39:30.358
Just like you.

39:52.899 --> 39:55.003
Get home safe.

39:58.173 --> 39:59.508
Abby!

40:02.466 --> 40:03.930
(Door opens)

40:03.950 --> 40:05.755
(Footsteps)

40:09.839 --> 40:12.006
It was one dinner.

40:14.376 --> 40:16.177
They've gone. Are you happy?

40:16.211 --> 40:18.814
- They're not our friends.
- We don't have friends.

40:20.149 --> 40:21.983
You have work. What do I have?

40:22.018 --> 40:25.186
You have Callie.
I don't want those people in our house.

40:25.220 --> 40:28.982
Maybe you should just write me a
list of who I can and can't talk to.

40:38.171 --> 40:40.035
I understand.

40:42.872 --> 40:46.574
There's some kind of crisis at work.

40:49.556 --> 40:51.694
You have no idea.

40:52.302 --> 40:54.623
But this is our life.

40:58.220 --> 41:00.789
There'll always be a crisis.

41:38.592 --> 41:40.294
Callie.

41:44.233 --> 41:46.067
Callie, sweetheart.

41:48.594 --> 41:50.538
Cal...
(Gasps)

41:51.361 --> 41:53.619
Thank you very much, Callie.

41:57.593 --> 42:01.282
You look like a goddess.

42:02.551 --> 42:04.152
Thank you.

42:07.071 --> 42:08.756
Good night.

42:09.892 --> 42:11.892
I have no clue how those two lunatics

42:11.927 --> 42:14.219
produced such a well- behaved child.

42:16.105 --> 42:18.267
Honestly, that was not my fault.

42:18.287 --> 42:21.002
The man's burned bridges at half
the schools in the Ivy league.

42:21.036 --> 42:22.804
They should arrest him for arson.

42:22.838 --> 42:25.406
You ought to hear the things they
say about him in the tech area.

42:25.440 --> 42:27.876
I mean, it's outrageous, but spot-on.

42:27.910 --> 42:29.910
I don't want to talk.

42:38.553 --> 42:40.555
- (Wind blowing)
- Check the stand.

42:40.589 --> 42:43.357
(Chattering)

42:45.461 --> 42:48.529
- What is the PSI yield?
- 300,000.

42:48.564 --> 42:50.431
Jim: How come I have to carry the TNT?

42:50.465 --> 42:52.633
- You don't have any children.
- Neither do you.

42:52.668 --> 42:54.944
No, but there's a chance I will.

42:54.964 --> 42:57.984
***

42:58.004 --> 43:00.554
***

43:01.944 --> 43:04.512
Oh, great. It's a tailgate party.

43:06.473 --> 43:08.037
(Laughing)

43:08.558 --> 43:10.518
Here, give it to me.

43:10.552 --> 43:12.787
What, now you get stage fright? Come on.

43:12.822 --> 43:15.690
Three-inch diameter,
quarter-inch wall, half-inch charge.

43:15.725 --> 43:19.160
- Three quarter-inch charge.
- What? Right. Right.

43:19.195 --> 43:21.162
Three quarter-inch charge.

43:21.196 --> 43:23.564
Frank Winter?

43:24.667 --> 43:26.634
From the colonel.

43:28.872 --> 43:30.225
Frank: Can this not wait an hour?

43:30.245 --> 43:32.907
No, train's leaving the station.

43:43.740 --> 43:45.319
Here.

43:45.354 --> 43:47.455
We want uniform pressure.

43:48.071 --> 43:49.585
Four detonation points

43:49.605 --> 43:52.526
evenly spaced around the circumference.

43:52.561 --> 43:54.663
But Barath is gonna be here in 45 minutes!

43:54.697 --> 43:57.065
I will be back in 40.

44:01.603 --> 44:03.938
Check the connections.

44:03.973 --> 44:05.973
(Overlapping chatter)

44:10.946 --> 44:13.081
(Music blaring)

44:16.518 --> 44:18.010
(Music stops)

44:18.620 --> 44:20.306
Sid.

44:21.824 --> 44:23.491
Frank?

44:23.525 --> 44:25.393
Oh, Jesus Christ.

44:29.231 --> 44:31.532
Five minutes. I need you to focus.

44:31.566 --> 44:33.000
What the hell is going on?

44:33.034 --> 44:34.869
There's a transport bus
leaving the hill in one hour.

44:34.904 --> 44:37.330
- You're gonna be on it.
- A transport to where?

44:37.350 --> 44:40.308
Texas and then the pacific theater.

44:40.342 --> 44:42.009
You mean as a soldier?

44:42.043 --> 44:44.678
I convinced the colonel
to sign your draft papers.

44:44.713 --> 44:45.980
What?

44:46.015 --> 44:48.350
Trust me, this is the best you're gonna do.

44:48.370 --> 44:50.728
It's a fighting chance.

44:51.787 --> 44:53.537
I'm not gonna last one day.

44:53.557 --> 44:55.656
They're gonna push you
through basic training.

44:55.691 --> 44:57.515
And when your boots hit the ground,

44:57.535 --> 44:59.560
look for the company headquarters tent

44:59.594 --> 45:01.595
and you find a man with this rank.

45:01.630 --> 45:03.164
Now listen to me.

45:03.198 --> 45:05.799
You tell him that you are a scientist.

45:05.834 --> 45:07.882
You know more about sound
waves than Westinghouse.

45:07.902 --> 45:10.004
Transmissions, frequencies.
You can build a wireless

45:10.039 --> 45:11.686
from a steno pencil and copper thread.

45:11.706 --> 45:14.042
Maybe even show him some trigonometry.

45:14.076 --> 45:16.329
Most of these doughboys can't
put two and two together.

45:17.212 --> 45:18.537
I... I don't...

45:18.557 --> 45:20.948
They're gonna make you a radio operator.

45:20.982 --> 45:24.786
You'll ride out the war in a HQ
tent a mile from the front lines.

45:24.820 --> 45:26.720
You'll come home dreaming
of a night's sleep

45:26.755 --> 45:29.657
on a cardboard mattress and a hot meal,

45:29.691 --> 45:31.892
but you will come home.

45:37.133 --> 45:38.675
(Sighs)

45:38.948 --> 45:41.035
You arranged all this?

45:41.070 --> 45:42.956
For me?

45:45.507 --> 45:47.337
I have to get back.

45:47.357 --> 45:49.610
You keep your head down and you'll be fine.

45:49.644 --> 45:52.446
Was it crosley who sold me out?

45:52.481 --> 45:54.949
Whole group is on your side, Sid.

45:54.984 --> 45:57.151
I thought the group was disbanded.

45:57.186 --> 45:59.320
We've been reinstated.

46:00.143 --> 46:01.819
How?

46:04.559 --> 46:06.995
Army changed its mind.

46:16.338 --> 46:18.773
You saved your baby, Frank.

46:19.469 --> 46:21.789
I told them you would.

46:22.013 --> 46:24.011
Told them Frank always finds a way.

46:25.680 --> 46:27.348
- Sid...
- You said it yourself.

46:27.382 --> 46:29.517
I can put two and two together.

46:35.832 --> 46:37.656
(Pounds)

46:51.139 --> 46:52.881
(Door locks)

46:59.814 --> 47:02.083
Fritz: 53-yard radius. Is that right?

47:02.117 --> 47:03.536
I think so. I don't know.

47:03.556 --> 47:05.919
- Where the hell is he?
- Gentlemen.

47:05.954 --> 47:08.889
Lost time is never found again

47:08.923 --> 47:11.925
and you are wasting mine.

47:11.960 --> 47:14.295
The plutonium will remain
with Dr. Akley's group.

47:14.329 --> 47:15.828
No, wait.

47:16.262 --> 47:17.975
Let's do it.

47:31.447 --> 47:33.186
- What?
- That asshole in the suit,

47:33.206 --> 47:34.629
get him back here.

47:34.649 --> 47:37.045
I'm ready to talk.

47:49.050 --> 47:51.131
(Explosion)

47:51.166 --> 47:53.234
Stop!

48:30.079 --> 48:31.939
It's not your fault.

49:09.979 --> 49:11.912
(Pounding)

49:14.183 --> 49:16.117
(Pounding)

49:24.382 --> 49:27.385
We should have brought foot- longs,
make it a weenie roast.

49:27.708 --> 49:30.230
Barbecued Franks? You coming?

50:08.083 --> 50:10.552
At least you got the kid out.

50:13.142 --> 50:16.377
Without plutonium, we're useless.

50:19.653 --> 50:22.483
Live to fight another day.

50:27.923 --> 50:30.623
Could have been any one
of a hundred things...

50:30.643 --> 50:32.293
rusty cylinder,

50:32.327 --> 50:34.295
moisture on the blasting caps.

50:36.097 --> 50:38.966
Maybe they couldn't read
your lousy handwriting.

50:44.673 --> 50:47.041
What do you think it was?

50:51.710 --> 50:53.748
I got distracted.

51:01.823 --> 51:05.125
(Pounding)

51:07.274 --> 51:09.329
He's got my sidearm.

51:10.666 --> 51:12.800
Get me a telephone.

51:31.587 --> 51:34.622
Let's go. That's all you need, thanks.

51:42.531 --> 51:44.875
Get me both gates. Both gates, please.

51:48.870 --> 51:50.786
(Music playing on radio)

51:50.806 --> 51:52.809
Hey, let's go.

51:55.977 --> 51:58.012
Whoa, whoa, whoa, buddy.

52:00.682 --> 52:03.100
- This ain't the Indy 500.
- Sorry.

52:03.120 --> 52:05.185
Got to see your pass.

52:05.220 --> 52:08.132
Sir, could you please just open the gate?

52:08.152 --> 52:11.258
Look, no tickee, no washee.

52:16.965 --> 52:19.774
Sir, if you could please just
open the gate.

52:19.794 --> 52:21.822
(Phone ringing)

52:27.269 --> 52:30.930
Look, just show me your
pass and I'll open the gate.

52:30.950 --> 52:33.614
Sir, I don't have my pass on me right now.

52:33.648 --> 52:36.450
I left it in my dorm room, okay?

52:36.484 --> 52:39.753
- Please, sir?
- All right, just...

52:39.788 --> 52:41.655
Could you please just open the gate,
please?

52:41.690 --> 52:44.191
- Sit tight a minute.
- Sir, please. Sir.

52:44.225 --> 52:46.484
(Ringing continues)

52:49.998 --> 52:52.066
(Gunshot)

53:06.648 --> 53:10.017
(Alarm sounding)

53:12.621 --> 53:14.422
What did I do?

53:29.871 --> 53:33.240
(Alarm sounding)
(Men shouting)
