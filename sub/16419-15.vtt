00:07.172 --> 00:09.619
Previously, on "Game Shakers"...

00:09.620 --> 00:13.240
- I'm looking to
spend about ten million

00:13.241 --> 00:15.516
on some clever way
to promote our grand opening.

00:15.517 --> 00:18.412
- Is that food
from Clam Jumper!? Oh!

00:18.413 --> 00:21.205
- My dad has a problem with
food from The Clam Jumper.

00:21.206 --> 00:23.171
He loves it too much.

00:23.172 --> 00:24.930
- Mmmm...
Oh Clam Burger!

00:24.931 --> 00:26.447
- Oh my god!

00:26.448 --> 00:29.240
We could add your
Clam Burger Character

00:29.241 --> 00:30.930
to our game,
Llama Llama Spit Spit...

00:30.931 --> 00:32.205
- I love it!
- Ohhhh!

00:32.206 --> 00:34.240
- And then on your
grand opening night

00:34.241 --> 00:37.550
we live stream the game,
right to that billboard.

00:37.551 --> 00:39.067
- Well if you're
a good enough deal maker

00:39.068 --> 00:40.240
to get us that billboard...

00:40.241 --> 00:43.136
- Then we absolutely
have a deal!

00:43.137 --> 00:44.516
We wanna talk with you

00:44.517 --> 00:46.343
about renting your
billboard in Midtown.

00:46.344 --> 00:48.481
- No chance!
Uh-uh...

00:48.482 --> 00:51.412
- What if we hack his billboard?

00:51.413 --> 00:52.895
- Do you seriously think
you could do that?

00:52.896 --> 00:55.205
- Watch!

00:55.206 --> 00:57.033
All I have to do
is get this thing

00:57.034 --> 00:58.309
really close to the billboard

00:58.310 --> 01:00.136
and then I can sync to it

01:00.137 --> 01:02.343
and make whatever I want
appear on the billboard.

01:02.344 --> 01:03.585
- Hey!
I can't find my Pear Pad!

01:03.586 --> 01:04.619
- What's so important

01:04.620 --> 01:06.067
about your Pear Pad?

01:06.068 --> 01:08.033
- That video of my dad
was on it!

01:08.034 --> 01:09.757
- And I've seen that video.

01:09.758 --> 01:11.205
- You have my Pear Pad?

01:11.206 --> 01:12.343
- And you think that'll get this

01:12.344 --> 01:13.688
all the way over
to the billboard?

01:13.689 --> 01:15.033
- That's what Bobby Dong said.

01:15.034 --> 01:16.343
- If those Clam Jumper people

01:16.344 --> 01:17.895
see that video of my dad,

01:17.896 --> 01:19.895
it could blow up the deal!

01:19.896 --> 01:21.310
- Bang!

01:30.241 --> 01:31.723
- No, no, listen...

01:31.724 --> 01:36.516
I need to talk to Bobby Dong.
Thank you.

01:36.517 --> 01:38.550
Hey, did you finish
making the new wifi bridge?

01:38.551 --> 01:40.930
- Not yet.
- Well hurry 'cuz w... Bobby?

01:40.931 --> 01:43.309
Yeah hey, it's Babe
at Game Shakers.

01:43.310 --> 01:45.619
Listen, your launcher
shot our wifi bridge

01:45.620 --> 01:46.940
all the way through
the billboard.

01:48.241 --> 01:52.585
- Yeah, right through
a fat baby's face.

01:52.586 --> 01:54.274
- Ahh... hahahahah!

01:54.275 --> 01:55.999
- What?
Hey, it's not funny, man!

01:56.000 --> 01:57.895
C'mon, we got a ten million
dollar deal on the line here,

01:57.896 --> 02:01.654
so what else ya got?
Look, I don't care, as long as

02:01.655 --> 02:04.102
it'll get our wifi bridge
from the Clam Jumper

02:04.103 --> 02:07.412
all the way over
to that billboard!

02:07.413 --> 02:08.723
Yeah, come by Game Shakers
as soon as you can.

02:08.724 --> 02:10.034
- Okeey smokeey!

02:12.413 --> 02:13.481
- I'm back!

02:13.482 --> 02:16.240
- Tell me you have good news.
- Yep.

02:16.241 --> 02:17.274
They still have those
giant Statue of Liberty

02:17.275 --> 02:19.964
ice cream cones in Times Square.

02:19.965 --> 02:21.412
- Okay...

02:21.413 --> 02:24.930
I didn't ask you to lick
The Statue of Liberty!

02:24.931 --> 02:26.688
I asked you to check
on the billboard!

02:26.689 --> 02:28.723
- I did!
They got it fixed.

02:28.724 --> 02:31.757
- Great. Then it's ready for us
to try to hack again.

02:37.655 --> 02:39.551
- Ooo.
Unknown caller.

02:41.482 --> 02:43.688
Oh man! It's that guy who's
holdin' my Pear Pad hostage.

02:43.689 --> 02:46.654
- Say hello.
- 'Kay.

02:46.655 --> 02:48.447
- Hello.
- Hey!

02:48.448 --> 02:51.999
Unless you want the whole world
to see this video...

02:52.000 --> 02:55.033
Mmmmmm... Oh Clamburger!

02:55.034 --> 02:58.102
- you better bring me $12,000.

02:58.103 --> 02:59.895
- $12,000?

02:59.896 --> 03:01.585
- Yes.
That's right.

03:01.586 --> 03:03.102
- Okay, ugh...

03:03.103 --> 03:04.792
Where am I supposed
to bring you the money?

03:04.793 --> 03:06.861
- Tomorrow night,
right after dark,

03:06.862 --> 03:09.861
meet me in the alley,
right behind Fooders restaurant.

03:09.862 --> 03:12.310
Goodbye!
- Bye.

03:13.310 --> 03:14.723
- All right. Good job.

03:14.724 --> 03:16.861
Now go get $12,000.

03:16.862 --> 03:19.240
- What? I can't get that
much money by tomorrow night!

03:19.241 --> 03:21.274
- Why don't you just
ask your dad for the money?

03:21.275 --> 03:23.999
- 'Cuz he'll start
asking questions...

03:24.000 --> 03:25.723
and then he'll find out
I lost the video

03:25.724 --> 03:26.964
of him eatin' that Clamburger...

03:26.965 --> 03:28.481
and then you know
what he'll say?

03:28.482 --> 03:31.240
- No.

03:31.241 --> 03:34.102
- He'll go,
"Trip! Pack your bags, son!

03:34.103 --> 03:37.274
You're goin' to Utah!"

03:37.275 --> 03:39.757
- Heeeey everybody!

03:41.344 --> 03:43.723
- That's not a manly sound.

03:43.724 --> 03:44.757
- Babe! Dub's here...

03:44.758 --> 03:46.757
Throw the Clam Jumper food away!

03:46.758 --> 03:48.343
- Nah nah nah nah...

03:48.344 --> 03:50.826
no need to hide the food.

03:50.827 --> 03:53.344
I'm wearin' a clam patch!

03:54.896 --> 03:56.240
- What is a "clam patch"?

03:56.241 --> 03:59.033
- A clam patch contains
the same kinda chemicals

03:59.034 --> 04:01.654
you find in real clams!

04:01.655 --> 04:02.964
- And see, every hour,

04:02.965 --> 04:04.999
the patch releases
some of those chemicals

04:05.000 --> 04:06.274
into Dub's blood stream.

04:06.275 --> 04:07.309
- Which helps me control my urge

04:07.310 --> 04:09.171
to eat any Clam Jumper food.

04:09.172 --> 04:11.619
- Now Dub can go to the party
tomorrow night!

04:11.620 --> 04:14.688
- No no no no no,
Dub's not going to the party.

04:14.689 --> 04:17.585
- Yes I can go to the party.

04:17.586 --> 04:20.619
- Nooo! You'd be surrounded
by Clam Jumper food.

04:20.620 --> 04:22.585
- And we can't risk you
goin' nuts at the party

04:22.586 --> 04:23.723
and ruining our deal.

04:23.724 --> 04:25.205
- No problem.

04:25.206 --> 04:26.724
That's why I had
my doctor give me...

04:29.172 --> 04:33.757
- Extra clam patches!!!

04:33.758 --> 04:35.309
- And, if things get really bad,

04:35.310 --> 04:38.619
I'll just have Trip
to show me the video again.

04:38.620 --> 04:41.205
- Oh yeah... Trip,
you got that video?

04:41.206 --> 04:44.171
- Yeah yeah yeah, sure,
I got the video.

04:44.172 --> 04:47.171
Ha... Hey uh Dad,

04:47.172 --> 04:49.102
can I have $12,000.

04:49.103 --> 04:51.344
- All right.

04:53.172 --> 04:54.861
Let me see... Mmhuuhh...
Here you go...

04:54.862 --> 04:56.136
Ah wait wait wait.

04:56.137 --> 04:57.516
You clean your room
this mornin'?

04:57.517 --> 04:58.964
- Well no, not this
mornin', but...

04:58.965 --> 05:01.792
- No $12,000 for you.

05:01.793 --> 05:03.895
- D'awww, Dad,

05:03.896 --> 05:04.964

Bring it over here.

05:54.931 --> 05:56.481
- Mmhmm...

05:56.482 --> 05:58.481
- Whoa, where'd you
get 450 bucks?

05:58.482 --> 06:00.964
- I cashed in my tokens
from Funky Festers.

06:00.965 --> 06:02.309
- Awww, but you love that place.

06:02.310 --> 06:05.516
- Not after what I found
in the ball pit.

06:05.517 --> 06:07.033
- What'd you find
in the ball pit?

06:07.034 --> 06:08.447
- I'm not sure,

06:08.448 --> 06:10.517
but I think it was
a piece of some kid.

06:11.448 --> 06:13.619
- Hey guys.
I got something

06:13.620 --> 06:16.413
we can sell for a lotta money.
Look it...

06:17.758 --> 06:20.550
- Whoa.
- Is that a solid gold watch?!?

06:20.551 --> 06:22.309
- Yep... I got it from my Gammy.

06:22.310 --> 06:25.240
- Oh noooo,
did your Gammy pass away?

06:25.241 --> 06:27.067
- Nah, she fell asleep
in the bathtub

06:27.068 --> 06:29.378
and I just took it
off her wrist.

06:29.379 --> 06:32.619
- Okay, we're not selling your
wet Gammy's stolen watch.

06:32.620 --> 06:34.171
- We don't need to.

06:34.172 --> 06:37.171
Kenzie's $450
gets us to 12 grand.

06:37.172 --> 06:39.412
- Okay awesome.
- Yay I helped.

06:44.172 --> 06:46.067
- Hey hey, look who it is.

06:46.068 --> 06:50.310
MMM-BOBBY DOONNNNGGG.

06:52.517 --> 06:54.999
- So Bobby, did you
come up with another way

06:55.000 --> 06:56.378
for us to get the wifi bridge

06:56.379 --> 06:57.516
from the Clam Jumper
to the billboard?

06:57.517 --> 06:59.758
SHABOOM!!!

07:03.551 --> 07:07.482
- Ballooffakay...
Hehehe...

07:11.068 --> 07:13.205
- Oh, cool, a drone.
- Not just a drone!!!

07:13.206 --> 07:15.516
- Ahhhh!!!

07:15.517 --> 07:18.136
- How can that thing fly
without propellers?

07:18.137 --> 07:20.723
- Electromagnetic levitation.

07:20.724 --> 07:22.757
- Oooooooo.

07:22.758 --> 07:25.585
- Much more powerful
than a regular drone.

07:25.586 --> 07:26.688
- How powerful?

07:26.689 --> 07:28.413
- Chooba-loo.

07:42.517 --> 07:45.102
- Shut up!
- Ooo, so powerful!

07:45.103 --> 07:47.931
- What is that, a drone?

07:53.068 --> 07:55.585
- Wow... a drone you can sit on.

07:55.586 --> 07:57.861
That's progress.

07:57.862 --> 07:59.654
- But wait...
but...

07:59.655 --> 08:02.171
how will this thing
carry the wifi bridge?

08:02.172 --> 08:04.205
- Ah!
Chigipoo.

08:04.206 --> 08:05.999
Ijun gi gi han!

08:21.068 --> 08:23.378
- Oh, okay.
- Ooo, perfect.

08:23.379 --> 08:24.344
- Okay, this is perfect.

08:24.345 --> 08:25.378
At the Clam Jumper party,

08:25.379 --> 08:26.654
when no one's looking,

08:26.655 --> 08:27.861
we'll use this to fly
the wifi bridge

08:27.862 --> 08:28.862
over to the billboard...

08:28.863 --> 08:30.136
- I'll work the remote.

08:30.137 --> 08:31.274
- Yep.
And once we get it over there,

08:31.275 --> 08:32.481
you take over the billboard,

08:32.482 --> 08:33.861
and stream
Llama Llama Spit Spit.

08:33.862 --> 08:35.447
- Got it.
- And what do I do?

08:35.448 --> 08:38.136
- Nothing.
- Uh, not one thing.

08:38.137 --> 08:40.240
- Hey, it's almost dark out.

08:40.241 --> 08:42.067
Hudson c'mon,
we gotta go get my Pear Pad.

08:42.068 --> 08:44.964
- Be careful.
- We will.

08:44.965 --> 08:47.274
- Hey...
where'd Bobby Dong go?

08:53.172 --> 08:54.654
- Oh there he is...

08:57.827 --> 09:01.378
- When did he put on pajamas?!?

09:01.379 --> 09:03.827
- Bobby Dooooong...

09:14.965 --> 09:16.792
- Whoa, creepy alley.

09:16.793 --> 09:19.274
- Yeah.

09:19.275 --> 09:20.757
All right...
I still don't get

09:20.758 --> 09:22.171
why you're wearin'
that purple mustache.

09:22.172 --> 09:23.999
- It matches my boots.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.861
- Ulch, all right.
Wear the mustache.

09:25.862 --> 09:27.447
I don't care.

09:27.448 --> 09:30.861
- So, where's the jerk
who kidnapped your Pear Pad?

09:30.862 --> 09:32.136
- Hey!
I'm not a jerk!

09:32.137 --> 09:33.447
Did you bring the money?

09:33.448 --> 09:35.550
'Cuz the only thing
I care about...

09:35.551 --> 09:36.999
What the? D'ah!

09:37.000 --> 09:38.136
Ah! No!
Leave me alone!!!

09:38.137 --> 09:39.620
D'oh! Ah!
Get away!

09:45.103 --> 09:48.930
- Hey you!
Did you bring the $12,000.

09:48.931 --> 09:51.274
- Wait... Wait a second...
I think I know your voice.

09:51.275 --> 09:52.757
- No you don't.
