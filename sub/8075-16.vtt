[music playing]

00:03.704 --> 00:06.507
[theme music]

00:07.508 --> 00:09.143
Hi, can I borrow some sugar?

00:09.177 --> 00:13.314
No, I only have 21
and a half bags left.

00:13.347 --> 00:15.383
Well, we can't stay long
anyway 'cause we're off

00:15.416 --> 00:17.685
to see the P-E-D-I-A--

00:25.926 --> 00:26.827
attrition.

00:29.330 --> 00:30.498
Why are you going
to the foot doctor?

00:33.134 --> 00:35.936
We're gonna have a little
talk about Andy's verbal skills.

00:35.969 --> 00:37.071
Oh.

00:37.105 --> 00:39.840
Why, is he still tanking
all his job interviews?

00:39.873 --> 00:42.310
I'm just worried about the
way he's saying his words.

00:42.343 --> 00:46.580
Like, he won't say triangle,
he says tri-ane-gle.

00:46.614 --> 00:47.581
Or, hel-lo.

00:50.984 --> 00:53.487
Pauly Shore makes millions
of dollars saying that.

00:58.792 --> 01:01.129
So, they're just gonna
run some tests, you know.

01:01.162 --> 01:03.364
Check his palette, make sure
his hearing's all right and--

01:03.397 --> 01:05.466
Um, I'm going to borrow your
book on child development.

01:05.499 --> 01:06.367
OK?

01:06.400 --> 01:07.701
Yeah, but it's really old.

01:07.735 --> 01:09.303
You probably should
ignore that chapter

01:09.337 --> 01:10.404
on the heartbreak of polio.

01:14.308 --> 01:15.276
Hi, Andy.

01:15.309 --> 01:16.310
What you got here?

01:16.344 --> 01:17.211
This is cool.

01:17.245 --> 01:18.912
You push this thing in here.

01:18.946 --> 01:20.414
TOY: Heh-lo.

01:20.448 --> 01:23.251
Can you find the tri-ane-gle?

01:31.792 --> 01:32.760
[music playing]

01:32.793 --> 01:33.594
Jackie.

02:17.037 --> 02:18.506
[laughing]

02:19.507 --> 02:22.476
[music playing]

02:23.711 --> 02:27.948
A toast, my dear, to
my six-month schedule,

02:27.981 --> 02:31.485
cost of living $0.50
an hour pay increase.

02:31.519 --> 02:32.686
Dink.

02:32.720 --> 02:34.622
The joke's on them
'cause your cost of living

02:34.655 --> 02:37.958
only went up $0.40 an hour.

02:37.991 --> 02:39.092
Proud of me?

02:39.126 --> 02:42.996
What a man, what a man,
what a mighty good man.

02:43.030 --> 02:43.864
[knocking on door]

02:44.865 --> 02:46.099
Hey, Dan.

02:46.133 --> 02:48.502
Chuck, Bob.

02:48.536 --> 02:49.503
What are you two guys up to?

02:49.537 --> 02:54.575
Uh, you know, nothing.

02:54.608 --> 02:59.713
Um, just some, you know--

02:59.747 --> 03:02.350
Well, now that we caught up,
I guess we'll see you later.

03:05.052 --> 03:06.754
We kinda wanted to talk
to Dan about something--

03:06.787 --> 03:07.655
Yeah.

03:07.688 --> 03:08.556
--Rosie.

03:08.589 --> 03:10.891
It's a-- kind of a guy thing.

03:10.924 --> 03:12.826
Oh, really?

03:12.860 --> 03:18.966
Oh, no wonder I'm starting
to feel all shy and giggly.

03:18.999 --> 03:23.404
Uh, Dan, have you heard about
the minimum security prison

03:23.437 --> 03:24.505
they're building outside town?

03:24.538 --> 03:27.608
They're building
a prison in Lanford?

03:27.641 --> 03:30.110
No wonder the beauty parlor's
been so crowded lately.

03:35.683 --> 03:37.985
Um, well they're--
they're spending

03:38.018 --> 03:39.753
millions on this thing.

03:39.787 --> 03:42.456
And, uh, we were
wondering if maybe you'd

03:42.490 --> 03:44.425
be interested in getting the
old crew together and putting

03:44.458 --> 03:45.993
a bid in on the drywalling?

03:46.026 --> 03:48.028
Now look, I-- I know you
got it good at the garage,

03:48.061 --> 03:51.265
but this'd be a chance to make
a pretty good chunk of dough.

03:51.299 --> 03:52.466
[sighing]

03:52.500 --> 03:54.268
Well look guys, I
appreciate you thinking of me,

03:54.302 --> 03:56.003
but I'm pretty happy where I am.

03:56.036 --> 03:58.872
And he's not kidding,
that couch under him

03:58.906 --> 04:02.009
is hardly even faded.

04:02.042 --> 04:02.910
Are you sure, Dan?

04:02.943 --> 04:06.079
I mean, it's gonna be a bundle.

04:06.113 --> 04:08.048
Everyone in this
town's gonna get rich.

04:08.081 --> 04:09.116
Really?

04:09.149 --> 04:12.920
Great, that gives us
an excuse to leave.

04:12.953 --> 04:14.322
Look guys, I'm sorry.

04:14.355 --> 04:15.789
Hey, man, it's all
right, it's all right.

04:15.823 --> 04:16.890
Yeah.

04:16.924 --> 04:18.992
Maybe I'll apply to be a guard.

04:19.026 --> 04:19.827
Picture me as a guard?

04:22.930 --> 04:23.997
I can picture
you as a hostage.

04:28.369 --> 04:30.404
Uh, well, if you change
your mind, let us know, OK?

04:30.438 --> 04:31.305
Come on, Bob.

04:31.339 --> 04:32.540
Uh, yeah, OK.

04:32.573 --> 04:35.643
Uh, well, you know,
always wondered what

04:35.676 --> 04:38.211
that Canadian beer tastes like.

04:38.245 --> 04:39.112
Really?

04:39.146 --> 04:39.947
Yeah.

04:42.450 --> 04:43.351
It's really good.

04:50.358 --> 04:51.158
Thanks.

04:54.261 --> 04:55.996
One less thing to wonder about.

04:56.029 --> 04:59.400
[music playing]

05:02.936 --> 05:04.705
OK, I've got you
all set up here.

05:04.738 --> 05:06.974
All right, well, just show
me the instruction pamphlet

05:07.007 --> 05:07.808
and away I go.

05:13.280 --> 05:17.284
Dear god, what have I done?

05:17.317 --> 05:18.251
It's not that hard.

05:18.285 --> 05:19.687
You can do this,
don't be frightened.

05:19.720 --> 05:20.621
Oh.

05:20.654 --> 05:22.456
Come here, little man.

05:22.490 --> 05:25.225
Now are-- aren't
these supposed to give

05:25.258 --> 05:28.662
out some sort of a death ray?

05:28.696 --> 05:31.965
Not unless you press
control-alt-death ray.

05:31.999 --> 05:35.035
Take it back.

05:35.068 --> 05:36.537
It's not that hard.

05:36.570 --> 05:38.539
Look, here's that ABC software
I was telling you about.

05:38.572 --> 05:39.840
[beep]

05:39.873 --> 05:42.476
And this one here will teach
little Andy how to count.

05:42.510 --> 05:44.177
Is that Big Bird?

05:44.211 --> 05:45.446
That's him.

05:45.479 --> 05:47.114
Well that-- well, OK.

05:47.147 --> 05:50.050
This can't be that bad, huh?

05:50.083 --> 05:52.620
I also set you up
on America Online.

05:52.653 --> 05:54.955
Just click, click, and
you're on the internet.

05:54.988 --> 05:57.958
[dial up tone]

05:58.959 --> 06:01.328
[laughing]

06:03.931 --> 06:06.467
You can get news, you can talk
to people, it's really cool.

06:06.500 --> 06:07.535
Hey, can thing play Pong?

06:11.739 --> 06:15.776
OK, uh, I gotta get
going to work, so have fun

06:15.809 --> 06:17.377
and if you have any problems,
just give me a call.

06:22.950 --> 06:24.418
COMPUTER: Welcome.

06:24.452 --> 06:25.853
You've got mail.

06:31.459 --> 06:33.260
Hello?

06:33.293 --> 06:36.564
[music playing]

06:43.471 --> 06:44.805
[sighing]

06:47.374 --> 06:48.776
Doh!

06:48.809 --> 06:50.010
Who put that there?

06:50.043 --> 06:51.378
[clattering]

06:52.446 --> 06:53.413
Put that there?

06:53.447 --> 06:55.282
[clattering]

06:57.818 --> 07:01.221
Why don't you just
turn on the light?

07:01.254 --> 07:04.324
I didn't wanna wake you.

07:04.357 --> 07:06.393
It's this whole
prison drywall thing,

07:06.426 --> 07:07.628
I can't get it out of my mind.

07:07.661 --> 07:09.797
Am I crazy, Roseanne?

07:09.830 --> 07:10.931
Should I go for it?

07:10.964 --> 07:12.132
Yes.

07:12.165 --> 07:14.334
You gave that
no thought at all.

07:14.367 --> 07:15.903
Now, should I do it?

07:15.936 --> 07:17.104
No.

07:17.137 --> 07:18.806
Roseanne.

07:18.839 --> 07:21.842
Do you think we could
talk about this later, Dan?

07:21.875 --> 07:26.213
Come on now, you're ruining
our quality time together.

07:26.246 --> 07:28.616
I'm serious, honey.

07:28.649 --> 07:31.018
Well, you already told 'em no.

07:31.051 --> 07:34.855
What happened to the I've got a
great job at the garage thing?

07:34.888 --> 07:37.124
I-- is it such a great job?

07:37.157 --> 07:40.460
Well, yeah, I mean, it's the
first steady money we've ever

07:40.494 --> 07:45.666
had coming in, except for that
coupon scam we ran in the '70s.

07:45.699 --> 07:48.435
Well, let's just look
at the pros and cons.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.838
Now, it's true, the
garage is steady.

07:50.871 --> 07:52.806
And even if I got
this prison job,

07:52.840 --> 07:55.709
that doesn't mean there's
another job around the corner.

07:55.743 --> 07:57.911
So, work slow.

07:57.945 --> 07:59.346
But the grudge is boring.

07:59.379 --> 08:00.748
[roseanne sighing]

08:00.781 --> 08:04.317
It fries my mind, I come home
every night, I'm like a zombie.

08:04.351 --> 08:05.686
Yeah.

08:05.719 --> 08:08.556
Not like when you were doing
the drywall and you came home

08:08.589 --> 08:11.124
and you put on all
those puppet shows,

08:11.158 --> 08:15.596
you'd wear those straw hats
and strum that ukulele.

08:15.629 --> 08:17.030
[knocking on door]

08:17.064 --> 08:18.465
What?

08:18.498 --> 08:19.466
Yes we know.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.835
Your bedroom is beneath ours.

08:21.869 --> 08:22.803
No, not that.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.071
I was getting
something to drink and

08:24.104 --> 08:25.573
the word ukulele caught my ear.

08:25.606 --> 08:28.441
I love the ukulele,
do you have a ukulele?

08:28.475 --> 08:29.442
Night.

08:29.476 --> 08:31.411
Night.

08:31.444 --> 08:32.345
Goodnight.

08:35.883 --> 08:38.986
And I'll lose all my
city benefits if I quit.

08:39.019 --> 08:42.422
But I'll be making twice as much
money working for the prison.

08:42.455 --> 08:47.127
But it's a gamble, and should
we be gambling with a new baby?

08:47.160 --> 08:53.133
Yeah, Dan, you know when
Conners gamble, Conners lose.

08:53.166 --> 08:57.304
Of course, there was that
time at the state fair

08:57.337 --> 09:01.208
where you made that frog
land on that lily pad.

09:01.241 --> 09:02.509
No.

09:02.542 --> 09:06.580
Plus, we got the diner,
we got two mortgages.

09:06.614 --> 09:09.650
Yeah, and the diner needs
new wallpaper, and appliances,

09:09.683 --> 09:14.121
and some of them golden arches.

09:14.154 --> 09:16.489
OK, well, it's
settled, that's it.

09:16.523 --> 09:18.191
I'm sticking where I am.

09:18.225 --> 09:19.192
Hallelujah.

09:28.101 --> 09:30.037
Hey, Dan?

09:30.070 --> 09:32.505
Yeah?

09:32.539 --> 09:33.907
Well since you
woke me up, I just

09:33.941 --> 09:36.009
want you to know that I'm gonna
have some trouble getting back

09:36.043 --> 09:37.377
to sleep.

09:37.410 --> 09:38.278
So?

09:38.311 --> 09:40.013
So, that means you are too.

09:42.950 --> 09:43.784
I knew that.

09:47.888 --> 09:48.756
Dan?

09:48.789 --> 09:51.191
Yeah?

09:51.224 --> 09:52.693
Just checking.

09:52.726 --> 09:53.994
[music playing]

09:55.929 --> 10:00.500
My name is Mommy and I will
be your waitress tonight.

10:00.533 --> 10:03.003
We have specials on
the menu, including

10:03.036 --> 10:09.509
tender sweet peas, turkey in
its own broth, and peaches.

10:09.542 --> 10:11.244
And I know these
are good 'cause me

10:11.278 --> 10:13.647
and your dad make peach
daiquiris out of 'em.

10:17.617 --> 10:19.119
How long have I been a waitress?

10:19.152 --> 10:21.488
Well, not very long.

10:21.521 --> 10:26.827
And I'm just doing it 'til
an acting job opens up.

10:26.860 --> 10:29.296
And your dad fixes
trucks for the city,

10:29.329 --> 10:33.066
and he's only doing that
'till, uh, another one breaks.

10:36.203 --> 10:39.506
Best thing about your dad's
job is that it's secure.

10:39.539 --> 10:40.808
You know?

10:40.841 --> 10:44.477
Because, uh, the last big
risk we took was having you.

10:44.511 --> 10:46.814
And that was a very
big risk, but that's

10:46.847 --> 10:50.383
just the kind of people we are.

10:50.417 --> 10:51.218
Or, were.

10:54.121 --> 10:56.056
I know what you're thinking,
you're thinking well,

10:56.089 --> 11:01.995
since you took such
a big risk with me,

11:02.029 --> 11:03.931
and that turned out
so good, how come

11:03.964 --> 11:05.065
you're playing it safe now?

11:07.868 --> 11:08.702
Quit grilling me.

11:12.005 --> 11:20.247
Because, see, risks are
for younger people, not us.

11:23.550 --> 11:25.385
See, when you get to be
me and your dad's age,

11:25.418 --> 11:27.654
you wanna to know that you can
do the same thing over and over

11:27.687 --> 11:31.324
again, you know, 'till you die.

11:37.998 --> 11:40.467
OK, so, let's just
hypothetically say

11:40.500 --> 11:43.136
that your dad does take this
job at the prison, right?

11:43.170 --> 11:47.941
And what about when that job's
over, then what is he gonna do?

11:47.975 --> 11:51.511
Course, the way this
country's going now,

11:51.544 --> 11:55.783
I think they're always gonna
be building new prisons.

11:55.816 --> 11:58.518
Yeah, 'cause, you know,
the way people hardly

11:58.551 --> 12:00.553
have to pay for
what they do at all,

12:00.587 --> 12:03.590
it kinda makes crime look like
a really good thing to get into,

12:03.623 --> 12:06.026
so a lot more people are gonna
to be doing it, you know?

12:06.059 --> 12:08.061
And just by the sheer
odds, a lot more of 'em

12:08.095 --> 12:10.697
are gonna get caught, so
I think they're gonna be

12:10.730 --> 12:12.299
building a lot of prisons, man.

12:12.332 --> 12:13.600
I think those things
are gonna start

12:13.633 --> 12:15.468
going up faster than Starbucks.

12:18.205 --> 12:21.174
Yeah, and then, like, the
people in these prisons,

12:21.208 --> 12:22.475
you know, they're
gonna to need to eat.

12:22.509 --> 12:24.677
So, me and Jackie, maybe
we get in on the ground

12:24.711 --> 12:27.848
floor with some catering
kind of business, you know?

12:27.881 --> 12:30.383
And pretty soon, convicts
from all over the world

12:30.417 --> 12:32.886
will be coming to eat loose
meat in Lanford, Illinois.

12:36.056 --> 12:37.390
Dan?

12:37.424 --> 12:38.491
That's it.

12:38.525 --> 12:40.527
You're quitting that
boring job with the city

12:40.560 --> 12:42.229
and you're gonna apply
for that construction bid.

12:42.262 --> 12:45.065

woah, woah, woah, what?

12:45.098 --> 12:47.901

about this for, you know,

12:47.935 --> 12:49.269

12:49.302 --> 12:52.906
And, uh, this is a
big opportunity, here,

12:52.940 --> 12:54.808
and I think we should take it.

12:54.842 --> 12:56.109
Roseanne, is this
your way of telling

12:56.143 --> 12:59.612
me that you drank all my beer?

12:59.646 --> 13:02.249
No, I was just sitting here
and I was talking to the baby--

13:02.282 --> 13:06.086
OK, this sounds
pretty grounded already.

13:06.119 --> 13:09.689
No, Dan, he made me realize
that, uh, the thing that

13:09.722 --> 13:12.893
was always so great about us is
that we always took a chance,

13:12.926 --> 13:13.793
you know?

13:13.827 --> 13:17.130
And this is a chance.

13:17.164 --> 13:19.299

going awful fast here,

13:19.332 --> 13:21.101

13:21.134 --> 13:22.702
You know you want to do this.

13:22.735 --> 13:25.805
Let's take the risk.

13:25.839 --> 13:27.007
Look at him, Dan.

13:27.040 --> 13:31.578
He is just the greatest
success we have ever had.

13:31.611 --> 13:33.180
Something's in the air.

Darling gets offered

13:34.647 --> 13:38.085

Becky's applying to colleges.

13:38.118 --> 13:40.387
Everything's changing,
Dan, it's like we're

13:40.420 --> 13:42.890
on some huge cosmic roll now.

13:42.923 --> 13:45.092
Yeah, I guess.

13:45.125 --> 13:46.426
Maybe we should go for it.

13:46.459 --> 13:47.627
All right, let's go for it.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.296

14:24.597 --> 14:26.900
Jackie aren't those the same
clothes you had on yesterday?

14:29.602 --> 14:32.940
I don't know, maybe, clothes
are clothes, what's your point?

14:32.973 --> 14:35.008
Are you all right?

14:35.042 --> 14:37.044

thing since I last saw you?

14:37.077 --> 14:38.111
David, I'm fine.
