Somebody must have followed.

00:17.014 --> 00:18.681

00:18.749 --> 00:20.217
Why would she want
an artifact?

00:20.284 --> 00:22.162
She's a sworn FBI Agent.

00:33.763 --> 00:34.998
Since the days

the Regents have been
its protectors.

00:36.905 --> 00:39.243
Its first field agents,

00:39.310 --> 00:42.250
they were responsible
for instituting

00:42.318 --> 00:43.851
the artifact collection
procedures

00:43.919 --> 00:47.025
that we carry on today.

00:47.092 --> 00:50.030
Over time, as more and more
artifacts were amassed,

00:50.098 --> 00:53.100
the Regents became
not only its governors,

00:53.167 --> 00:54.969
but also the keepers
of its secrets.

the warehouses' survival

01:17.424 --> 01:19.426

01:33.378 --> 01:35.848
the triangle shirtwaist

01:35.915 --> 01:38.016
I began tracking

01:38.084 --> 01:39.418
Which, in addition
to artifact heisting,

01:39.485 --> 01:41.519
also includes kidnapping and,
if my calcs are right,

01:41.587 --> 01:42.654
murder.

01:42.722 --> 01:44.122
Four Regents have suffered

And now a fifth regent,
Theodora Stanton,

02:01.340 --> 02:03.708
has been reported missing.

02:03.776 --> 02:05.209

09:32.914 --> 09:35.115
Mr. Jackson is the head
of regent security.

09:35.183 --> 09:36.483
This is Philip Petrov

09:37.685 --> 09:39.085
Jane.

09:39.153 --> 09:41.054
You were about to explain
the reason

09:41.122 --> 09:42.121
for this intrusion.

09:42.189 --> 09:43.456
Sally Stukowski--

09:43.524 --> 09:46.225
this is the woman
who has been picking off

09:46.293 --> 09:47.759
your fellow Regents--

09:47.827 --> 09:49.328
was in this building
earlier today

09:49.395 --> 09:50.495
with an accomplice.

09:50.563 --> 09:52.297
Now, we have her in custody,
but--

09:52.365 --> 09:53.831
Thank you.
You might've started with that.

09:53.899 --> 09:56.267

has been compromised.

09:56.335 --> 09:57.669

Now.

09:57.737 --> 10:00.805
Oh, what a good idea.

10:06.712 --> 10:08.679

do you copy?

10:16.055 --> 10:17.288
Why didn't you bring
more men?

10:17.356 --> 10:19.156
The Regents do not travel
with an army.

10:19.224 --> 10:21.092

10:21.160 --> 10:22.127

10:26.299 --> 10:28.935
This location was chosen
only three hours ago.

10:29.002 --> 10:30.703
Then how did Stukowski
find you?

10:30.771 --> 10:32.439
She's obviously more
resourceful than you realized.

10:32.506 --> 10:33.473
Wait, no, the--
the stairs are safer.

10:33.541 --> 10:34.741
Elevator's faster.

10:34.809 --> 10:36.709
40 flights of stairs will take
way too long.

10:36.777 --> 10:38.444
- Yes, but it--
- With all due respect,

10:38.512 --> 10:39.512
Agent Bering,
we had this building secure

10:39.580 --> 10:42.014
until your team showed up.

11:03.602 --> 11:04.703
What is happening?

11:04.770 --> 11:06.938
The automatic brake
is engaged.

11:07.006 --> 11:10.008
That only happens
in case of...

11:10.076 --> 11:12.911
Emergency.

11:16.982 --> 11:19.550
What is that noise?

11:19.618 --> 11:22.386
Give me a boost.

11:34.497 --> 11:37.767
That's why you don't take
the elevator.

11:37.834 --> 11:39.602
What'd you see up there?

11:39.670 --> 11:41.004
The cables are gone.

11:41.071 --> 11:42.372
There's a corrosive energy
eating away

11:42.440 --> 11:44.274
at the emergency brakes.

11:44.342 --> 11:45.676
We don't have much time.

11:48.881 --> 11:50.748
Artie, did you bring
the grappler?

11:50.816 --> 11:53.551
Of course.

11:53.619 --> 11:55.453
Well, that's not standard
warehouse issue.

11:55.521 --> 11:57.789
It was in 1890.

12:00.192 --> 12:01.626
Okay.
Tie it off.

12:01.694 --> 12:04.528
Okay.

12:04.596 --> 12:05.830
Open the doors, quick.

12:07.766 --> 12:09.566
All right, everybody out.
Out, quick!

12:09.634 --> 12:11.167
Go, go, go!

12:12.836 --> 12:14.637
Whoa!
Go, Artie, out!

12:19.309 --> 12:21.210
Agh!

12:23.447 --> 12:24.781
- Are you all right?
- Uh--

12:24.848 --> 12:26.049
Oh!

12:26.116 --> 12:29.385
Oh.

12:44.401 --> 12:47.502
Stukowksi's got
another artifact.

12:54.054 --> 12:54.987
Well!

12:55.555 --> 12:58.390
Irene Frederic herself.

12:58.457 --> 12:59.825
I am honored.

12:59.892 --> 13:00.925
Drop it, Sally.

13:00.993 --> 13:03.995
You're from Connecticut.

13:04.063 --> 13:05.630
Wow.

13:05.698 --> 13:07.598
Very good.

13:07.666 --> 13:10.235
That's right, boy wonder.

13:10.302 --> 13:11.636
Even the human lie detector

13:11.704 --> 13:13.405
can't hear
a phony accent.

13:13.472 --> 13:15.707
So...

13:15.775 --> 13:17.910
What?
I'm supposed to be scared?

13:17.978 --> 13:21.814
Fear is a powerful motivator,
Ms. Stukowski.

13:21.882 --> 13:25.452
But we both know
what really motivates people

13:25.520 --> 13:29.156
is pain.

13:29.224 --> 13:30.758
All those people
you tortured and killed

13:30.826 --> 13:33.795
were more
than just Regents.

13:33.863 --> 13:35.263
They were my friends.

13:35.331 --> 13:37.798
Those friends are the ones
that started this, lady.

13:37.866 --> 13:39.767
Started what?
What did you do?

13:39.835 --> 13:42.669
You'll see soon enough.

13:48.208 --> 13:50.543
We're terribly sorry
to be losing

13:50.611 --> 13:52.145
such a valued customer,
Mr. Aquino.

13:52.212 --> 13:54.447
Isn't there anything I can do
to change your mind?

13:54.514 --> 13:55.581
No, no, no.

13:55.649 --> 13:56.816
Just transfer the funds
to this account

13:56.883 --> 14:01.087
at Grand Cayman Federal, hm?

14:02.489 --> 14:03.789
Okay, Stukowski's partner.

14:03.857 --> 14:07.893
What's the 411 on this guy?

14:07.961 --> 14:09.028
According to Interpol,

14:09.096 --> 14:10.063
James Aquino
is a demolitions expert

14:10.130 --> 14:11.698
and wanted in nine countries.

14:11.765 --> 14:12.865
He enjoys
hand-to-hand combat,

14:12.933 --> 14:14.700
mixing molotov cocktails,

14:14.768 --> 14:16.102
and instigating regime change
in foreign lands.

14:16.170 --> 14:17.470
Well, Sally has
some high-class friends.

14:17.538 --> 14:18.571
So if she's going all

14:18.639 --> 14:20.140
ten-little-Indians
on the Regents,

14:20.208 --> 14:22.008
shouldn't one of us be minding
the reservation?

14:22.076 --> 14:23.143
Well, there's no safer place
on Earth

14:23.211 --> 14:24.544
than the warehouse.

14:24.612 --> 14:26.513
Artie says its contingencies
have contingencies.

14:29.083 --> 14:30.851
All right, I'm going in.

14:30.919 --> 14:33.487
We're hot on the bad guy's
trail now, Artie--what's up?

14:33.554 --> 14:35.255
Stukowski took out the
elevators in this building

14:35.322 --> 14:38.391
using some kind
of corrosive artifact.

14:38.459 --> 14:40.360
Now, her associate
may still have it.

14:40.428 --> 14:42.929
Be careful.

15:00.915 --> 15:02.182
Okay, Mr. Aquino.

15:02.250 --> 15:04.117
You're all set to go.

15:04.185 --> 15:08.655
Thank you very much.

15:08.723 --> 15:10.323
Hold on there, Jimmy boy.

15:10.391 --> 15:11.758
I just have a few questions.

15:11.826 --> 15:14.961
Like: You realize
that's not a gun, right?

15:15.029 --> 15:17.664
You have no idea
what this can do.

15:20.301 --> 15:22.068
I'm on fire!

15:31.946 --> 15:35.081
He's out the door.

15:41.189 --> 15:42.689
Artie says he may have
an artifact.

15:42.756 --> 15:44.223
I would have to agree.

15:47.027 --> 15:48.561
Okay, so there's two sets
of stairs.

15:48.629 --> 15:49.996
There's one on the east corner
and one on the west.

15:50.063 --> 15:51.430
- We should split up.
- I'll take the east corner.

15:51.498 --> 15:53.366
Wait.

15:53.434 --> 15:55.535
My men downstairs
just broke out of that closet

15:55.603 --> 15:57.537
you locked them in.

15:57.605 --> 15:58.805
They're going to meet us
on the east stairwell.

15:58.872 --> 16:00.006
No, no, no.
There may be other traps.

16:00.073 --> 16:01.541
You tell them to get out
of the building

16:01.608 --> 16:02.708
and to call
emergency services.

16:02.776 --> 16:04.042
Mr. Kosan--
- We'll wait here

16:04.110 --> 16:05.411
while you and Agent Bering
check things out.

16:05.478 --> 16:07.012
Agent Bering,
I'm going with you.

16:07.080 --> 16:08.513
No, ma'am.
It's too risky.

16:08.581 --> 16:10.014
What, you mean like taking
the elevator?

16:10.082 --> 16:11.182
That kind of risky?

16:11.250 --> 16:12.683
Well, if you hadn't zapped
my men,

16:12.751 --> 16:14.151
we might've known that the
elevators had been compromised.

16:14.219 --> 16:15.586
Or you still might all be up
on the 40th floor,

16:15.654 --> 16:17.388
waiting to die.

16:17.456 --> 16:18.756
Or being alerted to danger.

16:18.824 --> 16:21.559
I'm going.
End of discussion.

16:25.897 --> 16:27.898
If this is a typical
snag, bag, and tag,

16:27.966 --> 16:29.366
I'd hate to see
what it's like

16:29.434 --> 16:31.101
when things
are all fubar.

16:31.169 --> 16:32.235
Well, I've been doing this
long enough

16:32.303 --> 16:33.570
to always expect
the unexpected.

16:33.638 --> 16:35.873
Oh, I stay well apprised

16:35.940 --> 16:38.775
of you and your partners'
exploits.

17:01.665 --> 17:03.433
The west stairway
has been compromised

17:03.501 --> 17:04.601
up to the 11th floor.

17:04.669 --> 17:06.770
Same thing in the east.

17:06.838 --> 17:08.305
Yeah, Stukowksi's cut off
all the exits.

17:08.373 --> 17:09.940
Which leaves us
with no way down.

17:10.008 --> 17:12.142
Well, when you cannot
go down,

17:12.210 --> 17:15.646
it would appear there's only
one direction left, no?

17:21.987 --> 17:23.988
Emergency services
are on their way,

17:24.055 --> 17:25.689
but they won't be much help
this high up.

17:25.757 --> 17:27.223
There's a helicopter on its way.
E.T.A. 30 minutes.

17:27.291 --> 17:28.726
- Excellent.
- Thank God.

17:28.793 --> 17:30.093
I don't like that look.
I've seen that look before.

17:30.161 --> 17:31.495
Yeah, I know.
There's something not right.

17:31.563 --> 17:33.797
We got up here too easily,
way too...

17:33.865 --> 17:35.366
easily.

17:35.434 --> 17:37.835
Wait here.

17:40.106 --> 17:43.441
That's a reflection
of our building.

17:43.509 --> 17:46.144
- That is coming fast.
- Yeah.

17:46.212 --> 17:49.048
We don't have 30 minutes.

17:56.580 --> 17:58.380
What do you mean
he got away?

17:58.448 --> 18:00.382
Aquino used some kind
of wacky spray-paint can

18:00.450 --> 18:02.851
that disintegrated
the bank manager's jacket.

18:02.918 --> 18:04.319
That explains
the anarchy symbol.

18:04.386 --> 18:05.653
What anarchy symbol?

18:05.721 --> 18:06.821
The one that is destroying

18:06.888 --> 18:08.122
the structure
of this building.

18:08.190 --> 18:10.958
Look.
Look at this reflection.

18:11.026 --> 18:12.526
What are you wasting time
talking to us for?

18:12.594 --> 18:13.461
You get the hell out
of there.

18:13.528 --> 18:15.229
Listen.

18:15.297 --> 18:16.430
The elevators are gone.

18:16.498 --> 18:17.898
The stairs are a death trap.

18:17.966 --> 18:19.233
We are stuck on this roof
until a helicopter arrives

18:19.301 --> 18:20.435
or the building disintegrates.

18:20.502 --> 18:22.036
I'm pulling
for the helicopter.

18:22.104 --> 18:23.538
All right,
we'll snag and bag the can.

18:23.605 --> 18:24.805
Maybe that'll stop it.

18:24.873 --> 18:26.707
Let's do that quickly,
shall we?

18:26.775 --> 18:28.943
Aquino could be anywhere
by now.

18:29.011 --> 18:31.513
How are we supposed
to find him?

18:31.580 --> 18:33.782
Hey, big brother's watching.

18:33.849 --> 18:35.884
Yes, yes.

18:35.951 --> 18:39.554
And so can little sister.

18:39.622 --> 18:44.193
I understand, Mr. Kosan.

18:44.261 --> 18:45.595
I will do whatever it takes

18:45.662 --> 18:47.864
to get the information
from her.

18:47.931 --> 18:50.266
Godspeed.

18:50.334 --> 18:51.300
Will the helicopter make it?

18:51.368 --> 18:54.169
It would appear unlikely.

18:54.237 --> 18:55.137
More innocent people,
Stukowski.

18:55.205 --> 18:57.305
Not so innocent, Jinksy.

18:57.373 --> 18:59.207
Now.

18:59.275 --> 19:02.176
You're going to tell us
about that spray can

19:02.244 --> 19:03.411
and what we can do
to stop it.

19:03.478 --> 19:05.046
Oh, I never was much
of an artist,

19:05.113 --> 19:06.414
but I always loved
to paint--

19:06.481 --> 19:10.317
Don't test me,
Ms. Stukowski.

19:10.385 --> 19:15.357
You used the triangle shirtwaist
factory doorknob

19:15.424 --> 19:19.128
to torture and then immolate
Theodora Stanton.

19:19.195 --> 19:21.764
But you're not the only one
who has access

19:21.832 --> 19:25.301
to those kinds of artifacts.

19:25.369 --> 19:28.639
Ma'am?

19:28.707 --> 19:30.041
This is not the doorknob,

19:30.108 --> 19:32.943
but when it's finished
with you,

19:33.011 --> 19:34.178
you're going to wish it was.

19:34.246 --> 19:35.879
That's from Unit 731.

19:35.947 --> 19:37.481
You're very well informed.

19:37.549 --> 19:39.349
What's Unit 731?

19:39.417 --> 19:43.453
Special Japanese military unit
during World War II

19:43.520 --> 19:45.788
that performed
human experimentation

19:45.856 --> 19:48.091
and biological warfare research.

19:48.158 --> 19:51.427
It's the medal
from Shiro Ishii's coat.

19:51.494 --> 19:55.165
The commander of Unit 731.

19:55.233 --> 19:57.334
This can achieve
in a few seconds

19:57.402 --> 20:01.772
what would take even the most
experienced interrogator days.

20:01.840 --> 20:03.274
You're bluffing.

20:03.342 --> 20:04.609
Artie said you don't torture.

20:04.677 --> 20:07.346
I'm not Artie.

20:10.584 --> 20:12.718
Oh--oh, n--

20:12.786 --> 20:14.453
No.

20:16.924 --> 20:18.524
You see?

20:18.593 --> 20:21.161
It can simulate drowning.

20:21.228 --> 20:24.865
You understand now,
don't you?

20:28.068 --> 20:29.168
You really think
you can find him?

20:29.236 --> 20:30.736
Aquino's on the run.

20:30.804 --> 20:32.538
I highly doubt he's gonna let
a red light stop him.

20:32.606 --> 20:34.574
What I can do is tap into
Atlanta's traffic cameras,

20:34.641 --> 20:36.476
which will flag
moving violations.

20:36.543 --> 20:37.944
Yeah, got him.

20:38.011 --> 20:39.812
Told ya.

20:39.880 --> 20:41.280
Well, he's got an offshore
account in the Caymans.

20:41.348 --> 20:42.715
I'll bet he's headed
for one of the airports.

20:42.783 --> 20:44.584
Well, he's not on any
commercial--wait.

20:44.652 --> 20:46.619
He booked a charter
out of Cassaday.

20:46.687 --> 20:47.987
That's private jets only.

20:48.055 --> 20:49.722
If he gets wheels up,
we're done.

20:49.790 --> 20:52.458
All right,
he was at this intersection.

20:52.525 --> 20:54.927
Here's the airport.

20:54.995 --> 20:56.962
No, there's no way
we'll catch him in time.

20:57.030 --> 20:58.297
Not necessarily.

20:58.365 --> 20:59.665
The Highlander nav system's
off the hook,

20:59.733 --> 21:02.034
but Aquino's car has
a notoriously lousy one.

21:02.102 --> 21:03.369
Yeah, well, he doesn't have
satellite radio,

21:03.437 --> 21:05.037
a backup camera,
and ten cup holders, either,

21:05.105 --> 21:06.939
but that doesn't help us
stop him

21:07.007 --> 21:09.876
from getting on a plane.

21:09.943 --> 21:12.711
Claudia, what is that?

21:15.082 --> 21:17.616
Just a little something
I whipped up.

21:17.684 --> 21:19.285
Prepare to have your mind blown.

21:19.352 --> 21:23.056
'Cause you did not see
this coming.

21:28.628 --> 21:29.795
Left turn ahead.

21:31.231 --> 21:34.900
Proceed west 0.23 miles.

21:38.371 --> 21:41.005
Next right and then--

21:41.073 --> 21:43.040
traffic alert.

21:43.108 --> 21:46.343
Alternate route advised.

21:46.411 --> 21:47.444
Take the next left.

21:47.512 --> 21:51.548
Then proceed east
1.5 miles.

21:51.616 --> 21:53.417
Talk to me, Sally.

21:53.485 --> 21:54.752
You can make this stop.

21:55.888 --> 21:57.856
Mrs. Frederic,
a word?

21:57.924 --> 21:59.658
What is it, Agent Jinks?

21:59.726 --> 22:02.261
We don't torture people.

22:02.329 --> 22:04.297
Need I remind you
of the lives

22:04.365 --> 22:05.899
Ms. Stukowski
has already taken?

22:05.966 --> 22:07.300
And she will pay
for her crimes,

22:07.368 --> 22:09.136
but in a court of law,
not like this.

22:09.204 --> 22:11.972
This is not a democracy,
Agent Jinks.

22:12.040 --> 22:13.574
Mrs. Frederic,
no form of torture

22:13.641 --> 22:15.543
has ever yielded
credible intel.

22:15.611 --> 22:16.977
It's been statistically proven.

22:17.045 --> 22:19.579
Agent Jinks, I have people
who are about to die,

22:19.647 --> 22:21.981
and that woman has
the information I need

22:22.049 --> 22:23.783
to free them.

22:23.851 --> 22:25.184
Now, if this is the way
I have to extract it,

22:25.252 --> 22:28.121
so be it.

22:32.058 --> 22:33.926
Now, then.

22:33.993 --> 22:36.462
Where were we?

22:42.036 --> 22:45.538
Myka.

22:45.605 --> 22:47.807
What?

22:47.874 --> 22:49.508
There's a window-washing rig
down on the 15th floor.

22:49.576 --> 22:50.676
That could be our ticket
out of here.

22:50.744 --> 22:51.778
Can we get to it?

22:51.845 --> 22:52.745
A window-washing rig,
seriously?

22:52.813 --> 22:53.913
You have a better idea?

22:53.981 --> 22:55.048
How do you propose
we get there?

22:55.116 --> 22:55.949
Maybe the corrosion
hasn't reached

22:56.017 --> 22:56.950
the 15th floor yet.

22:57.018 --> 22:57.951
A chance not worth taking.

22:58.019 --> 22:59.352
Oh, for God's sake.

22:59.420 --> 23:00.887
Look, I know that you are
the head of security

23:00.955 --> 23:01.855
for the Regents.

23:01.923 --> 23:02.990
Their lives are in your hands.

23:03.058 --> 23:04.358
I get that.
I-I do.

23:04.426 --> 23:05.960
But our window
of opportunity here

23:06.028 --> 23:07.595
is closing every second.

23:07.663 --> 23:08.830
Now, we can either take
this one shot

23:08.898 --> 23:09.964
or watch it close.

23:10.032 --> 23:13.434
Which would you prefer?

23:13.502 --> 23:16.237
- Let's move.
- Oh, brilliant.

23:21.910 --> 23:24.677
I'd heard you could be
rather persuasive, Agent Bering.

23:24.745 --> 23:26.579
My dad used to call it
bossy.

23:26.647 --> 23:28.481
The curse
of a natural-born leader.

23:28.548 --> 23:30.249
I wouldn't say
that I'm a natural-born leader.

23:30.316 --> 23:31.684
That's why you were
reinstated.

23:31.752 --> 23:32.752
You know about that?

23:34.854 --> 23:36.756
Of course I do.
You're meant to be here, Myka.

23:36.823 --> 23:38.391
We all are.

23:38.459 --> 23:40.860
I'm not sure I believe
in destiny.

23:40.928 --> 23:42.529
At a time when
we may have felt

23:42.597 --> 23:43.997
the least prepared
to accept a challenge,

23:44.065 --> 23:45.866
the warehouse called
upon each of us.

23:45.934 --> 23:48.769
You, Artie, me.

23:48.837 --> 23:51.872
And we answered that call.

23:51.940 --> 23:54.208
If that isn't destiny,
what is?

24:01.482 --> 24:03.450
Mr. Jackson,

24:03.518 --> 24:06.252
what's the status
of your men downstairs?

24:06.320 --> 24:10.722
Miller, Stentz.

24:10.790 --> 24:12.991
Oh!

24:13.059 --> 24:14.726
- Everybody out.
- Everybody up here.

24:14.794 --> 24:15.961
Upstairs, come on.

24:16.029 --> 24:17.362
Come on, go!

24:17.430 --> 24:19.665
Jane, give me your hand.

24:20.900 --> 24:22.334
Oh.

24:22.402 --> 24:24.336
Jackson.

24:24.404 --> 24:25.437
Give it here.

24:25.505 --> 24:26.739
Here.
I got you.

24:26.806 --> 24:28.774
Agh!

24:28.842 --> 24:31.177
Whatever it takes,
you save Philip.

24:31.245 --> 24:32.779
Just hold on.

24:32.846 --> 24:35.748
You have to save Philip.

24:39.820 --> 24:40.920
What are you doing?

24:40.987 --> 24:43.055
Saving you.

24:43.123 --> 24:45.858
No!

25:05.953 --> 25:07.220
It's eating
through the structure.

25:07.288 --> 25:09.022
We've got to get to that
window-washing rig now.

25:14.430 --> 25:16.698
Mr. Jackson understood
the hazards of this job,

25:16.766 --> 25:20.268
Agent Bering,
as do you.

25:20.336 --> 25:23.939
But we're not out of Dodge yet,
so cowboy up.

25:28.912 --> 25:32.714
Time is running out.

25:32.782 --> 25:35.083
How do I stop the paint?

25:39.754 --> 25:42.122
Go to hell.

25:45.292 --> 25:46.226
Mrs. Frederic, please.

25:46.294 --> 25:47.294
There's gotta be another way.

25:47.362 --> 25:49.263
The Berlin Wall.

25:49.331 --> 25:50.832
From the Berlin Wall.

25:50.899 --> 25:52.200
Tell me how to stop it.

25:52.267 --> 25:53.267
No, I don't know.

25:53.335 --> 25:54.569
Tell me how.

25:54.637 --> 25:55.804
I don't--
I don't know any--

25:55.871 --> 25:56.838
Please, I ca--

25:56.906 --> 25:57.973
Please, you're killing--

25:58.040 --> 25:59.508
Please, I can't.

25:59.576 --> 26:00.842
I ca--I can--I--

26:00.910 --> 26:04.113
I'm sorry, ma'am.

26:04.180 --> 26:06.549
But I can't let you
do this.

26:08.719 --> 26:10.353
Stand down, Agent Jinks.

26:10.421 --> 26:13.323
No.

26:15.293 --> 26:17.896
I may be new,
but I know this is wrong,

26:17.964 --> 26:19.298
and this is not what we do.

26:19.365 --> 26:21.400
Protecting the warehouse
is what we do.

26:21.468 --> 26:23.235
If you are not up to the task--

26:23.303 --> 26:25.037
Actions have consequences,

26:25.105 --> 26:27.740
and this will come back
to bite us.

26:37.618 --> 26:40.820
Now, Mr. Jinks,
we must address the consequences

26:40.888 --> 26:43.723
of your actions.

26:46.026 --> 26:47.627
Well, it's not
in our database.

26:47.695 --> 26:49.095
I mean, I searched Berlin Wall
and spray-paint can,

26:49.163 --> 26:50.329
and all I got were a bunch
of photos of east Germany.

26:50.397 --> 26:52.865
Let me see it.

26:52.933 --> 26:54.867
Of course.

26:54.935 --> 26:56.703
- What?
- For nearly 30 years,

26:56.771 --> 26:58.304
the wall was a symbol
of oppression.

26:58.372 --> 26:59.639
For young East Berliners,

26:59.707 --> 27:01.775
the anarchy sign
was the ultimate expression

27:01.842 --> 27:03.743
of the rebellious spirit.

27:03.811 --> 27:06.212
And somehow that spirit gave
an ordinary spray-paint can

27:06.280 --> 27:08.214
the ability to tear down
more than just walls.

27:08.282 --> 27:10.217
All right, so you think
if we find the can,

27:10.284 --> 27:11.518
we can reverse it?

27:11.586 --> 27:13.353
Artie and Myka
are still trapped inside.

27:13.421 --> 27:15.322
This is bigger than the lives
of our people,

27:15.390 --> 27:16.557
Agent Lattimer.

27:16.624 --> 27:20.460
Get that can,
and get back there ASAP.

27:20.528 --> 27:22.062
Well, you heard the lady.

27:22.130 --> 27:23.430
Reel him in.

27:24.966 --> 27:26.566
Take the next left.

27:26.634 --> 27:28.935
Proceed ahead 100 feet,

27:29.003 --> 27:30.837
and then...

27:37.844 --> 27:40.011
Prepare to be captured.

27:45.450 --> 27:46.951
- Cover me, Claude.
- On it.

27:49.822 --> 27:51.790
Hey, hey, hey!
Jimbo! It's over, man.

27:51.857 --> 27:53.391
Stay back.

27:53.459 --> 27:55.527
Just give me the spray can,
and tell me how it works.

27:55.594 --> 27:57.462
Forget it, pal.
We're both caught.

27:57.529 --> 28:00.365
No, look,
we can figure something out.

28:00.433 --> 28:01.967
Okay? Just--
just tell me how it works

28:02.034 --> 28:03.268
and how we can stop it.

28:03.336 --> 28:05.003
I have no idea.

28:05.071 --> 28:07.373
Anyway, you kill me or--
or he does.

28:07.441 --> 28:09.909
Who?
Who are you working for?

28:09.977 --> 28:11.278
Man, we can--
we can protect you.

28:11.345 --> 28:13.213
You can't even protect
yourselves.

28:13.281 --> 28:17.017
Either way, I'm dead.

28:17.085 --> 28:19.520
No, no, no!

28:19.588 --> 28:21.556
No, no, !

28:22.891 --> 28:26.059
Claudia, get the bag.

28:29.297 --> 28:30.631
You think that stopped it?

28:30.698 --> 28:33.967
I don't know. Call Artie.
See if it worked.

28:34.035 --> 28:35.836
The window-washing rig
should be

28:35.903 --> 28:37.704
just two floors below us.

28:37.772 --> 28:39.673
Yeah.

28:39.741 --> 28:40.841
Any luck?

28:40.909 --> 28:41.775
The can is snagged
and bagged.

28:41.843 --> 28:43.077
Is it--is it over?

28:43.145 --> 28:44.679
No, the building's still
coming down.

28:44.746 --> 28:46.147
We're running out of time.

28:46.215 --> 28:47.749
I don't know, maybe we need
to be closer to it.

28:47.816 --> 28:48.817
- Yeah.
- Okay, guys, just hold on.

28:48.885 --> 28:49.851
We're on our way.

28:49.919 --> 28:51.453
- Pete?
- Yeah?

28:51.521 --> 28:52.555
Hurry.

28:52.622 --> 28:54.690
We're already there.

29:01.066 --> 29:03.467
- Sir?
- Agh!

29:03.535 --> 29:05.102
- You all right?
- All right.

29:05.169 --> 29:06.236
Philip--
where is Philip?

29:06.304 --> 29:08.338
Agh!

29:08.406 --> 29:09.773
Pull it off.

29:09.840 --> 29:11.407
- Phil.
- Here, Artie, Artie.

29:11.475 --> 29:14.577
Don't touch that!

29:14.645 --> 29:16.278
- Philip, here.
Let--

29:16.346 --> 29:18.914
- Don't. There's no time.

29:18.982 --> 29:22.083
Jane, we must make transfer
quickly.

29:27.023 --> 29:28.056
What--what--
what are you doing?

29:28.124 --> 29:30.292
- What is that?
- Remati shackle.

29:30.360 --> 29:32.162
Genghis Khan went
to great and terrible lengths

29:32.229 --> 29:33.663
to create it,

29:33.731 --> 29:36.367
to make sure that Mongols
kept control of Warehouse 7.

29:36.434 --> 29:39.003
It can't be destroyed
by conventional means.

29:39.071 --> 29:40.839
No warehouse agent
has seen

29:40.906 --> 29:43.775
what you are
about to witness.

30:02.426 --> 30:03.626
The transfer is complete.

30:04.961 --> 30:06.962
Mr. Kosan,
we have to get out of here now.

30:07.030 --> 30:09.198
Let's go, then. Now.
Jane!

30:09.266 --> 30:10.632
We can't just leave
Philip here.

30:10.700 --> 30:13.235
Jane, you must.

30:13.303 --> 30:15.570
Or all this will be
for nothing.

30:15.638 --> 30:17.906
My time is over.

30:17.974 --> 30:21.176
You are the guardian now.

30:33.421 --> 30:37.391
The window-washing rig is...

30:37.458 --> 30:38.658
it's still there.

30:38.726 --> 30:40.794
Oh, thank God.

30:40.861 --> 30:44.531
Jane.

30:44.598 --> 30:46.399
Jane, we have to go, okay?

30:46.467 --> 30:48.902
Yeah.

30:48.970 --> 30:51.705
All right.

30:56.511 --> 31:00.247
Hope you have a ladder
in there.

31:00.314 --> 31:02.049
Lloyd Wright's pickup sticks.

31:02.116 --> 31:03.584
Yeah, Frank's son
used to play with these

31:03.651 --> 31:04.718
while watching
his father work.

31:04.786 --> 31:06.587
He would often copy
his designs.

31:06.654 --> 31:09.256
This got me out of a bad scrape
in Bangkok in '94.

31:13.061 --> 31:14.995
Except that was
a few pounds ago.

31:15.063 --> 31:17.497
I think I'd better
get down there and see

31:17.565 --> 31:18.498
if this thing holds.

31:18.566 --> 31:20.267
Good luck.

31:20.334 --> 31:21.635
Okay, let's do it.
God.

31:25.240 --> 31:27.808
Oh, God.

31:27.876 --> 31:30.411
All right.

31:40.824 --> 31:43.225
Look, he knew the risks.

31:43.293 --> 31:45.161
Okay? And so do you.

31:45.228 --> 31:47.429
So cowboy up, lady.

31:47.497 --> 31:49.131
'Cause we're getting the hell
out of Dodge.

31:49.198 --> 31:50.098
Come on.

31:54.870 --> 31:57.905
Now you, Jane.

31:57.973 --> 31:59.673
Adwin, get down that ladder
before you pass out.

31:59.741 --> 32:01.408
Jane, I'm fine.
You really must--

32:01.476 --> 32:04.010
Go.

32:04.078 --> 32:05.778
Hurry.

32:12.052 --> 32:14.887
Just be careful.

32:23.964 --> 32:25.699
Come down!

32:36.344 --> 32:37.744
We've gotta--

32:37.812 --> 32:42.249
we've gotta get this rig up--
up there.

32:42.317 --> 32:43.884
It's no use.

32:43.952 --> 32:46.120
Without power,
this rig will only go down.

32:46.187 --> 32:49.556
Myka, I'm coming up for you.

32:49.624 --> 32:51.892
No, Artie, listen!
There's not enough time!

32:51.960 --> 32:54.361
Artie, the ladder is
already corrupted.

32:58.533 --> 33:00.234
I'm not leaving you!

33:00.302 --> 33:01.535
Go, Artie!
We'll--

33:01.603 --> 33:04.271
we'll find
another way down.

33:34.177 --> 33:36.018
What's going on up there?
What the hell is that?

33:36.019 --> 33:37.585
Toxic chemical spill.

33:37.653 --> 33:39.588
There are people trapped
on 17.

33:39.656 --> 33:41.657
Chemicals?
Joe, get downtown on the phone.

33:41.724 --> 33:43.359
We're not equipped to handle
a situation this big.

33:43.426 --> 33:44.527
There's nothing you can do.

33:44.594 --> 33:45.728
I got a team coming.

33:45.795 --> 33:46.829
Just get out of here!

33:46.897 --> 33:48.397
Let's go,
everybody back.

33:52.069 --> 33:53.303
What if Jane doesn't make it?

33:53.371 --> 33:55.539
That is a possibility
we cannot entertain.

33:55.607 --> 33:56.807
She is the guardian now.

33:56.875 --> 33:58.576
She must be rescued.
She has to be rescued.

33:58.643 --> 34:00.478
No, no, no.
Get him to a medic.

34:00.545 --> 34:02.780
- She has to be--
- Get him to a medic.

34:02.848 --> 34:05.483
Everybody get out of here!

34:13.726 --> 34:14.893
There must be something
we can use

34:14.960 --> 34:16.161
to lower ourselves down.

34:16.228 --> 34:17.661
What would they do
if there was a fire?

34:17.730 --> 34:20.031
Fire.

34:20.099 --> 34:22.867
Myka, get those
elevator doors open.

34:29.507 --> 34:32.009
The shaft is clear.

34:32.077 --> 34:36.080
Tell me that you're not
suggesting that we jump.

34:36.147 --> 34:37.581
There's two of these
on every floor.

34:37.649 --> 34:39.116
We can go four floors
at a time,

34:39.183 --> 34:41.217
all the way down
to the basement exit.

34:41.286 --> 34:42.985
I'm impressed.

34:43.054 --> 34:44.688
Little trick
my husband taught me.

34:44.755 --> 34:45.989
What, was he in <i>Die Hard?</i>

34:46.056 --> 34:48.259
Hope you're not afraid
of heights.

34:51.797 --> 34:53.831
How did you know?

34:53.900 --> 34:56.835
Okay, I'm coming!

35:11.050 --> 35:11.983
Artie!

35:12.051 --> 35:13.184
We made it.

35:13.252 --> 35:14.419
Artie, where's Myka?

35:14.487 --> 35:16.488
She and a regent
are still up there.

35:16.556 --> 35:18.424
You--you left her in there?
How could you just leave--

35:18.491 --> 35:20.226
No, no, Pete, no.
There's nothing you can do.

35:20.293 --> 35:22.428
Look.

35:22.496 --> 35:23.929
The anarchy symbol.
Where's the spray can?

35:23.997 --> 35:25.063
It's right here.

35:25.131 --> 35:26.398
What, you think we can
reverse it?

35:26.466 --> 35:28.167
An artifact that is born
of extreme emotion

35:28.234 --> 35:30.736
sometimes requires
extreme emotion to be triggered,

35:30.804 --> 35:31.937
to be neutralized,
so I thought if we--

35:32.005 --> 35:33.338
Graffiti.
Those German taggers

35:33.406 --> 35:35.307
were constantly spraying over
each other's messages.

35:35.374 --> 35:36.675
All right, so we spray over
Stukowski's symbol.

35:36.742 --> 35:37.809
You think that'll work?

35:37.877 --> 35:39.744
It's worth a try.

35:39.812 --> 35:42.614
The anarchy symbol represents
chaos and destruction.

35:42.682 --> 35:43.849
- So paint the opposite.
- All right.

35:43.916 --> 35:46.618
Well, I'm in extreme emotion
right now.

36:08.107 --> 36:09.407
Oh! Oh.

36:09.475 --> 36:11.710
Yes.

36:11.777 --> 36:15.581
Oh, thank God I didn't wear
my good shoes.

36:15.649 --> 36:17.082
- Just, uh--
- Oh, yeah.

36:17.150 --> 36:18.884
- Help me open this door.
- Yeah.

36:18.952 --> 36:20.118
Okay, if we can get
through the basement,

36:20.186 --> 36:23.889
there are often
underground tunnels that--

36:23.957 --> 36:28.694
Oh, no.

36:28.761 --> 36:29.994
Oh.

36:30.062 --> 36:33.064
Not exactly
the Butch and Sundance moment

36:33.132 --> 36:35.799
I was hoping for.

36:35.867 --> 36:37.434
More like Thelma and Louise.

36:38.803 --> 36:40.237
Oh.

36:43.140 --> 36:46.543
Come on, come on!

36:46.610 --> 36:49.345
Keep going, Pete.
It's working.

37:07.165 --> 37:09.667
Nice!

37:12.805 --> 37:14.973
Yes, okay.

37:15.040 --> 37:17.776
Come on, let's go get Myka.
Come on!

37:28.255 --> 37:29.388
- Ha!
- Oh, my God.

37:33.059 --> 37:34.660
Oh.

37:34.728 --> 37:36.862
For some reason,
I think--

37:36.930 --> 37:39.965
I think that Pete
had something to do with this.

37:40.033 --> 37:41.099
He's a good partner.

37:41.167 --> 37:43.034
Yes.

37:53.879 --> 37:56.213
Sally, Sally, Sally.

37:57.949 --> 37:59.783
What was unclear

37:59.851 --> 38:02.620
about "Destroy that building
and everyone in it"?

38:02.687 --> 38:03.820
I'm sorry.

38:03.888 --> 38:06.057
They had more resources
than we thought.

38:06.124 --> 38:07.425
And Mrs. Frederic
has no trouble

38:07.493 --> 38:08.893
crossing the line.

38:08.961 --> 38:10.962
Never underestimate
the denizens

38:11.029 --> 38:13.931
of Warehouse 13, Sally.

38:13.999 --> 38:15.967
You know,
they are dangerous people.

38:16.035 --> 38:18.069
There is a silver lining,
though.

38:18.137 --> 38:20.072
You were right
about Agent Jinks.

38:20.139 --> 38:21.273
He hasn't drunk
the kool-aid yet,

38:21.341 --> 38:23.141
and I've already started
working on him.

38:23.209 --> 38:24.810
That won't be necessary.

38:25.878 --> 38:27.045
Oh!

38:27.113 --> 38:31.216
I'm sorry.

38:31.284 --> 38:32.952
Hmmm.

38:33.019 --> 38:39.058
I'm sorry, too, Sally.

38:39.126 --> 38:42.494
It'll look like
an undetected heart defect.

38:42.562 --> 38:46.364
Mm.

38:46.431 --> 38:49.233
Marcus, you were right.

38:49.301 --> 38:52.970
She wasn't up to it.

38:53.038 --> 38:56.540
I'll make sure
someone finds her.

38:56.607 --> 38:59.476
You're a good friend.

39:14.703 --> 39:15.870
Where, where, where?
Where's Myka?

39:16.400 --> 39:17.733
Myka!

39:17.801 --> 39:20.168
Myka!

39:20.236 --> 39:21.370
Hey, Pete.
I'm--

39:21.437 --> 39:23.572
Hey.

39:23.640 --> 39:25.107
I'm okay.

39:25.175 --> 39:27.042
I'm fine.

39:27.110 --> 39:28.977
Hey, I'm fine.

39:29.045 --> 39:32.113
Claudia traced
a routing number

39:32.181 --> 39:34.148
back to the people we believe
hired James Aquino.

39:34.216 --> 39:36.851
It's a company called
A to Z Technologies.

39:36.918 --> 39:38.119
Whoever they are,
they know far more about us

39:38.187 --> 39:39.487
than we know about them.

39:39.555 --> 39:42.357
An enemy with an arsenal
of artifact weapons

39:42.425 --> 39:44.159
would not only be dangerous.

39:44.227 --> 39:45.494
No, they could be
unstoppable.

39:45.562 --> 39:47.463
Until we can identify
these people

39:47.531 --> 39:49.999
behind this
A to Z Technologies,

39:50.067 --> 39:51.701
we must fortify our defenses.

39:51.769 --> 39:53.703
And once we identify them?

39:53.771 --> 39:57.607
Strike.
And strike hard.

39:57.675 --> 39:58.741
Come on.

39:58.809 --> 40:00.543
This was no
assassination attempt.

40:00.611 --> 40:02.445
The Remati shackle,
that was the real target.

40:02.513 --> 40:04.447
I'm afraid so.
They were trying to destroy it.

40:04.514 --> 40:05.581
Why? What's its power?

40:05.649 --> 40:06.882
Protection.

40:06.950 --> 40:08.084
In an emergency,

40:08.151 --> 40:09.618
that shackle is
the last line of defense

40:09.686 --> 40:13.755
for Warehouse 13.

40:13.822 --> 40:16.557
Well, that was a crappy day
at the office, huh?

40:20.128 --> 40:21.696
What's going on?

40:21.763 --> 40:24.432
You look like you put down
Old Yeller yourself

40:24.500 --> 40:29.137
or something.

40:29.204 --> 40:30.505
You know, Claude,
there is no one

40:30.572 --> 40:34.675
that I would rather
chase artifacts with than you.

40:34.743 --> 40:39.847
Why am I sensing
an ugly subtext here?

40:39.915 --> 40:42.783
I was...

40:42.851 --> 40:45.652
T...

40:45.720 --> 40:47.354
insubordinate today.

40:47.422 --> 40:49.756
Oh, please.
Welcome to my world.

40:49.824 --> 40:54.027
No, I'm serious.

40:54.094 --> 40:58.297
It's complicated.
I--

40:58.365 --> 41:02.535
I drew my gun
on Mrs. Frederic.

41:02.602 --> 41:05.705
And, uh,
and she fired me.

41:05.773 --> 41:09.009
What?

41:09.076 --> 41:11.212
No.

41:11.279 --> 41:12.746
N-no.
No, no, no.

41:12.814 --> 41:15.016
That's ridiculous.
I'm gonna go talk to her.

41:15.083 --> 41:16.417
I'll just explain to her
it was just a misunderstanding.

41:16.485 --> 41:17.618
No, don't.

41:17.686 --> 41:20.655
Please don't.

41:20.722 --> 41:23.491
I'm sorry, Claude,
but I can't do what she want--

41:28.964 --> 41:31.799
I'm sorry.

41:43.846 --> 41:46.014
You know,
you're really not allowed

41:46.081 --> 41:49.151
to face death without me.

41:49.219 --> 41:52.788
Next time, I promise.

41:52.856 --> 41:55.692
And I heard you had to babysit
one of the Regents.

41:55.760 --> 41:58.862
That must've been a pain.

41:58.929 --> 42:01.998
Actually,
she's kind of kick-ass.

42:02.066 --> 42:03.566
Come on,
I want to introduce you.

42:03.634 --> 42:05.635
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

42:05.703 --> 42:09.104
Uh, Jane?

42:09.172 --> 42:10.605
Jane?

42:10.673 --> 42:12.007
Hey, I-I want you to meet
my partner.

42:12.075 --> 42:14.843
This is Agent Pete Lattimer.

42:19.381 --> 42:20.882
Mom.
