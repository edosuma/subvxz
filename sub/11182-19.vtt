* We finally got

00:23.457 --> 00:26.026
* Fish don't fry

00:26.094 --> 00:28.662
* Beans don't burn

00:28.729 --> 00:31.265
* Took a whole lot of tryin'

00:31.332 --> 00:33.867

* We finally got

01:11.872 --> 01:13.341
There.

01:13.407 --> 01:15.476
This is what you learned
in your first aid class?

01:15.543 --> 01:18.011
Yeah. If your arm
was really broken,

01:18.078 --> 01:21.515
you can make
an emergency splint
with this magazine.

01:21.582 --> 01:23.984
Well, wouldn't it be easier
to use a phone book?

01:24.051 --> 01:26.687
-A phone book?
-Yeah. To call a doctor.

01:28.989 --> 01:31.859
(WHISTLING)
What's going on?

01:31.925 --> 01:34.595
Oh, Florence is pretending
she has a broken arm.

01:34.662 --> 01:37.064
Ha. She's been doing
that ever since
the day we hired her.

01:38.932 --> 01:40.701
I hope you never get
a broken mouth.

01:40.768 --> 01:42.703
They don't make
magazines that big.

01:44.405 --> 01:46.106
How would you like
to go into the kitchen?

01:46.174 --> 01:48.209
If you're staying in here,
I'd love to.

01:50.077 --> 01:53.314
Well, how's my lovely,
charming bride
this beautiful day?

01:54.982 --> 01:57.551
I'm fine.
What are you
so happy about?

01:57.618 --> 01:59.753
I'm always happy
when I'm about to make
a lot of money.

01:59.820 --> 02:02.089
-(LAUGHS)
-A lot of money?

02:02.156 --> 02:07.295
That's right. Tomorrow,
I will be the proud owner
of six cleaning stores.

02:07.361 --> 02:09.863
Oh, George, that's wonderful.

02:11.699 --> 02:12.833
Wait a minute.

02:12.900 --> 02:15.469
Did you say
six cleaning stores?

02:15.536 --> 02:16.570
That's right.

02:16.637 --> 02:19.173
But you already own
seven stores.

02:19.240 --> 02:22.276
How can you make
a lot of money
by owning one less?

02:22.343 --> 02:24.745
Because I'm selling my store
in Queens.

02:24.812 --> 02:26.280
And I'm getting double
what it's worth.

02:27.147 --> 02:28.816
-Double?
-That's right.

02:28.882 --> 02:31.084
I'm having a meeting
at the store today
to close the deal.

02:31.151 --> 02:33.153
Leroy's over there now
waiting for me.

02:33.221 --> 02:34.655
What is he doing there?

02:34.722 --> 02:36.657
Well, because the manager's
on vacation

02:36.724 --> 02:38.626
and Leroy's filling in
for him.

02:38.692 --> 02:41.462
But, George,
that was your first store.

02:41.529 --> 02:43.664
You always said
it's your good luck charm.

02:43.731 --> 02:45.733
Right. And it's still
giving me good luck.

02:45.799 --> 02:47.968
I mean, I'm gonna make
a killing on this deal.

02:48.035 --> 02:52.005
Oh, but that store has
so much sentimental value.

02:52.072 --> 02:54.742
I still remember
the first day you opened it.

02:54.808 --> 02:58.145
Yep, and I picked you up
and carried you
across the threshold.

02:58.212 --> 03:01.682
And put me down behind
the cash register,

03:02.850 --> 03:05.653
-where I worked for two years.
-(LAUGHS)

03:05.719 --> 03:08.656
I remember the time
that dude asked you
if you cleaned rabbit fur.

03:08.722 --> 03:10.291
And you said,
"Not if it's still on
the rabbit."

03:10.358 --> 03:12.260
(BOTH LAUGHING)

03:12.326 --> 03:13.727
Boy, oh...

03:13.794 --> 03:17.331
Oh, that store
is so full of memories.

03:17.398 --> 03:19.300
-Yeah...
-I hate to see you sell it.

03:19.367 --> 03:23.203
Well, I have to, Weezy.
They made me an offer
I can't refuse.

03:23.271 --> 03:25.172
You mean
the Mafia's buying it?

03:25.239 --> 03:26.807
-No.
-(PHONE RINGING)

03:28.075 --> 03:30.143
Some company called Wymac.

03:32.079 --> 03:33.981
Hello.

03:34.047 --> 03:35.182
Hey, Leroy, what's happening?

03:35.249 --> 03:37.285
Mr. Jefferson,
I need help down here.

03:37.351 --> 03:38.519
Help? For what?

03:38.586 --> 03:40.954
A whole bunch of people
came by, all at once.

03:41.021 --> 03:43.391
Well, you're the manager.
Can't you handle it yourself?

03:43.457 --> 03:45.058
Well, there's a lot of them.

03:45.125 --> 03:47.027
-Well, are you
waiting on them?
-No, sir.

03:47.094 --> 03:49.630
-Why not?
-They're outside.

03:49.697 --> 03:52.300
Outside? Well, do they have
dirty clothes with them?

03:54.234 --> 03:55.436
Some do.

03:57.170 --> 04:00.073
-Well, let 'em in, dummy.
-Let 'em in?

04:00.140 --> 04:02.710
Right. And have them line up
in single file.

04:02.776 --> 04:04.778
Line up? Yes, sir.

04:05.746 --> 04:06.947
And then what?

04:07.014 --> 04:09.283
Then take their clothes
from them.

04:11.452 --> 04:12.820
Some of them are women.

04:12.886 --> 04:15.589
Well, take their clothes, too.

04:15.656 --> 04:17.958
I don't think
they're gonna like that.

04:18.025 --> 04:20.227
Sure they will.
Customers don't like to wait.

04:20.294 --> 04:23.096
But these ain't customers.
They're picketers.

04:23.931 --> 04:25.766
Who are they striking?

04:25.833 --> 04:27.368
They ain't hitting nobody yet.

04:30.304 --> 04:31.972
But they look pretty mad.

04:32.039 --> 04:33.774
Okay, I'll be there
right away.

04:33.841 --> 04:35.843
Damn! Be right back, Weezy.

04:35.909 --> 04:37.945
Where you going?

04:38.011 --> 04:39.880
Down to the store.
I gotta show Leroy how
to take care of business.

04:39.947 --> 04:41.615
Oh. (SIGHS)

04:43.751 --> 04:45.386
(WHISTLING)

04:45.453 --> 04:46.520
There he is!

(ALL SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY)

04:54.328 --> 04:57.064
-Wait. Hold it, hold it.
-How can you do this to us?

04:57.130 --> 04:59.467
I was born
in this neighborhood.

04:59.533 --> 05:01.369
You're not gonna
get away with it.

05:01.435 --> 05:03.136
Well, would somebody
mind telling me
what's happening?

05:03.203 --> 05:06.039
(SPEAKS SPANISH)

05:07.675 --> 05:08.976
She says she's mad.

05:09.843 --> 05:11.278
-You speak Spanish?
-No.

05:11.345 --> 05:14.247
But that's mad
in any language.

05:14.314 --> 05:17.050
Okay, look, if you don't
get out of here right now,
I'm gonna call the police.

05:17.117 --> 05:19.720
Oh, well, you go ahead
and call the police,
Jefferson.

05:19.787 --> 05:22.089
-If we get arrested,
it might help our cause.
-(TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

05:22.155 --> 05:24.558
Oh yeah?
Would you mind telling me
what your "cause" is?

05:24.625 --> 05:27.895
Oh, come on,
you know why
we're here, Shorty.

05:30.297 --> 05:31.932
Now, don't play dumb with us.

05:31.999 --> 05:33.801
-Oh, he ain't playing.
-Leroy...

05:36.136 --> 05:38.071
What I meant was that...

05:38.138 --> 05:40.574
Look, Leroy, would you mind
getting behind the counter
and waiting on some customers?

05:41.409 --> 05:43.176
There ain't no customers here.

05:43.243 --> 05:45.613
That's because
there's nobody here
to wait on them.

05:52.720 --> 05:54.988
So, are you gonna
sell your store?

05:55.055 --> 05:57.124
-That ain't none
of your business!
-It sure is!

05:57.190 --> 06:00.461
If you sell your store,
we won't have
any place to live.

06:00.528 --> 06:02.630
What are you
talking about, man?
You don't live in my store.

06:02.696 --> 06:05.165
Yeah, but if you sell
your store, that means
they got the whole block.

06:05.232 --> 06:08.201
-Who's they?
-Wymac, Shorty!

06:08.268 --> 06:09.970
Will you stop
calling me Shorty?

06:10.037 --> 06:11.505
Okay, Sonny.

06:13.807 --> 06:16.977
-You, uh, really don't know
what's going on, do you?
-No, I don't.

06:17.044 --> 06:19.947
-Look, Wymac wants to buy
every building on this block.
-For what?

06:20.013 --> 06:23.250
So they can tear
them down and build
expensive apartments.

06:23.316 --> 06:25.052
And we've got to move.

06:25.118 --> 06:28.221
I've got a good mind
to punch those people
in the nose!

06:28.288 --> 06:31.525
-But, ma'am...
-(SPEAKS SPANISH)

06:31.592 --> 06:33.627
(CLAMORING)

06:36.129 --> 06:38.666
What do you expect me to do?
I'm only one little guy.

06:38.732 --> 06:40.834
-Yeah, but you're
their last one.
-Huh?

06:40.901 --> 06:43.203
All the other owners
on the block
have agreed to sell.

06:43.270 --> 06:46.373
Now it's all up to you.
If you sell, it's all over.

06:47.508 --> 06:48.842
Oh.

06:48.909 --> 06:50.811
-I'm the last one, huh?
-That's right.

06:50.878 --> 06:53.647
You're the only thing
standing in Wymac's way.

06:53.714 --> 06:56.817
Oh, ain't that something.
That sure changes things.

06:56.884 --> 06:58.852
-(LAUGHS)
-GERALD: Excuse me.

06:58.919 --> 07:00.353
Oh, oh, I'll take care
of that for you.

07:00.420 --> 07:02.490
-But, um...
-Oh, you can
pick it up Friday.

07:02.556 --> 07:05.058
-But I don't want it cleaned.
-Why? It sure could use it.

07:05.125 --> 07:08.028
-(LAUGHS)
-I'm looking
for Mr. Jefferson.

07:08.095 --> 07:09.897
My name is Gerald Woodley.

07:09.963 --> 07:11.899
Mr. Woodley from Wymac!

07:11.965 --> 07:13.734
Hey, great looking coat
you got here.

07:15.068 --> 07:16.904
Oh, how you doing?
I'm George Jefferson.

07:16.970 --> 07:19.206
Is there someplace
we can talk over the deal?

07:19.272 --> 07:21.842
-Oh.
-Deal? Then you
are going to sell.

07:21.909 --> 07:24.411
Oh, you can't trust
short people!

07:25.879 --> 07:27.915
Wait a minute.
I never said I was gonna sell.

07:27.981 --> 07:29.517
But you said
it was a good offer.

07:29.583 --> 07:32.285
We should have known
you wouldn't listen to us.

07:32.352 --> 07:34.688
Yeah, you were planning
on selling all along.

07:34.755 --> 07:37.457
But that was before
I found out what was going on.

07:37.525 --> 07:40.027
Don't try to con us, Shorty!

07:40.093 --> 07:41.695
But I'm telling you the truth.

07:41.762 --> 07:43.230
-(TALKING INDISTINCTLY)
-Oh, come on...

07:43.296 --> 07:45.165
Okay, okay,
I'll prove it to you.

07:46.700 --> 07:49.436
Now, tell these folks.

07:49.503 --> 07:54.708
Did you, a duly appointed
representative of
Wymac Corporation,

07:54.775 --> 07:58.546
make a financial proposal
to me, George Jefferson,

07:58.612 --> 08:01.014
for the sale of this property
to Wymac Corporation?

08:01.081 --> 08:03.917
-Of course, I did.
-And did I accept this offer?

08:03.984 --> 08:05.085
Well, you said you would be...

08:05.152 --> 08:06.654
Did I accept it, yes or no?

08:06.720 --> 08:08.756
-Well, no, but...
-Well, then I don't accept it.

08:08.822 --> 08:10.658
(ALL CHEERING)

-Oh, man, Mr. Jefferson,
you're all right.
-Thank you.

08:12.292 --> 08:14.762
Yeah, we were wrong about you.

08:14.828 --> 08:16.163
Thank you, thank you.

(SPEAKS SPANISH)

08:23.003 --> 08:24.772
Oh, merci beaucoup.

08:26.807 --> 08:29.142
Okay, come on, let's go.

08:29.209 --> 08:32.846
I can hardly wait to tell
the good news
to Mom and Dad!

08:32.913 --> 08:34.214
Oh...

08:35.382 --> 08:37.885
Bye.

08:37.951 --> 08:41.321
-That was very clever,
Mr. Jefferson.
-Huh?

08:41.388 --> 08:43.591
Getting rid of those people
by telling them
you weren't selling.

08:43.657 --> 08:45.525
(LAUGHS)
Of course it was clever.

08:45.593 --> 08:46.994
Especially since
it's the truth.

08:47.060 --> 08:48.796
Are you serious?
You're not going to sell?

08:48.862 --> 08:50.664
That's right.
Not at the price
you're offering.

08:50.731 --> 08:52.600
But the other owners
have agreed to sell.

08:52.666 --> 08:55.736
That's their problem.
I can't help it
if I'm smarter than they are.

08:55.803 --> 08:57.104
Oh, I see.

08:57.170 --> 08:59.607
The price on your store
just went up, huh?

08:59.673 --> 09:01.842
-You got it.
-Okay.

09:01.909 --> 09:05.178
Now, I offered you
double what your store
is worth. Right?

09:05.245 --> 09:07.214
Right.

09:07.280 --> 09:11.619
Well, I have the power
to make that three times
what it's worth.

09:11.685 --> 09:13.253
Really? Okay.

09:13.320 --> 09:15.623
When you get more power
than that, come and see me,

09:18.225 --> 09:19.727
and we'll talk business.

I was just thinking
about dinner tonight.

09:33.941 --> 09:35.776
Good. What were you
thinking of making?

09:39.880 --> 09:43.316
I was thinking about
what you could make.

09:43.383 --> 09:44.652
Okay, what did you
have in mind?

09:45.485 --> 09:46.854
Oh, I don't know.

09:46.920 --> 09:49.723
I've got a taste
for something
out of the ordinary.

09:49.790 --> 09:52.492
Something exotic and oriental.

09:52.559 --> 09:54.695
Hey, how about
Lobster Cantonese?

09:54.762 --> 09:56.764
Yeah.
That sounds great.

09:56.830 --> 09:59.232
Good. Why don't you call
Ming Lo's and see when
they can deliver?

10:01.434 --> 10:02.903
Forget it, Florence.

10:02.970 --> 10:04.537

10:12.445 --> 10:14.882
Well, my goodness,
I have to do
all the work around here.

10:19.052 --> 10:20.287
Hi, Florence.

10:20.353 --> 10:23.691
Louise, have you seen
page 14 in The Globe?

10:23.757 --> 10:25.492
-No.
-I have.

10:25.558 --> 10:29.262
The saddest Dear Abby letter
I ever read.

10:29.329 --> 10:35.068
"Dear Abby. My husband uses
my electric toothbrush
to clean his shoes.

10:35.135 --> 10:36.737
"What should I do?"

10:39.306 --> 10:41.541
Tell him to use
fluoride shoe polish.

10:41.608 --> 10:43.076
(LAUGHING)

10:49.516 --> 10:51.418
No. No, no.

10:51.484 --> 10:54.554
I'm talking about this story
about George's store
in Queens.

10:54.621 --> 10:57.858
Was that in
Dear Abby's column, too?

10:57.925 --> 11:01.194
Florence, I'm talking about
these people who are being
thrown out of their homes.

11:01.261 --> 11:04.597
What people?
And what does it have
to do with George?

11:04.664 --> 11:07.801
The Wymac Corporation
is buying up the whole block,

11:07.868 --> 11:10.037
and then they're gonna build
luxury apartments.

11:10.103 --> 11:13.406
Well, no wonder
Mr. Jefferson got such
a good price for his store.

11:13.473 --> 11:17.344
Florence, I'm sure George
didn't know anything
about this scheme.

11:17.410 --> 11:21.181
Child, Mr. Jefferson
is down at his Queens store
right now making a deal.

11:21.248 --> 11:25.418
I better call him
and tell him what
Wymac is planning to do.

11:25.485 --> 11:28.521
* I said we're in the money

11:28.588 --> 11:30.958
Oh, George,
I was just gonna call you.

11:31.024 --> 11:33.160
Well, good.
I just saved us a dime.
(LAUGHING)

11:34.261 --> 11:35.929
Did you accept Wymac's offer?

11:35.996 --> 11:37.530
-No. Why?
-Are you sure?

11:37.597 --> 11:39.599
Sure, I'm sure. Why?

11:39.666 --> 11:41.969
Then you heard about
the people
in the neighborhood.

11:42.035 --> 11:43.303
What about them?

11:43.370 --> 11:45.238
Wymac is building
luxury apartments

11:45.305 --> 11:47.808
and forcing the people
who live there now to move.

11:47.875 --> 11:50.677
Oh, yeah,
I found out about that.
The pickets told me about it.

11:50.744 --> 11:52.445
And they talked you
out of selling?

11:52.512 --> 11:53.947
Well, let me
tell you something.

11:54.014 --> 11:55.816
After talking to those people
who live on that block,

11:55.883 --> 11:58.886
ain't no way that Wymac
can make me accept
that crummy offer.

11:58.952 --> 12:01.922
Oh, George, you're wonderful!

12:01.989 --> 12:04.191
Oh, we're really proud
of you for turning it down.

12:04.257 --> 12:05.859
Well, it ain't no big thing.

12:05.926 --> 12:08.461
Oh, George,
don't be so modest.

12:08.528 --> 12:10.730
Just think when you go down
to that store,

12:10.798 --> 12:13.366
all those people can look
at you and say,

12:13.433 --> 12:16.669
"There's that wonderful man
who saved our home."

12:26.847 --> 12:29.382
I can't believe this.

12:29.449 --> 12:31.651
Read it out loud.

12:31.718 --> 12:36.990
"George Jefferson,
owner of Jefferson's Cleaners,
has become a local hero.

12:37.057 --> 12:38.225
(LAUGHING)

12:38.291 --> 12:41.661
"By resisting the pressure
from Wymac Corporation,

12:41.728 --> 12:44.998
"he is the lone man
responsible for holding off

12:45.065 --> 12:47.567
"the destruction
of the neighborhood."

12:47.634 --> 12:49.469
How'd you get the story
on the front page?

12:49.536 --> 12:52.873
It was easy. The editor is
a friend of mine.

12:52.940 --> 12:54.207
Since when?

12:54.274 --> 12:56.209
Well, since I gave him
a year's free cleaning.

12:58.311 --> 13:01.414
Besides, newspapers
are always looking
for good scoops.

13:01.481 --> 13:03.583
Scoop? For you,
they'd need a shovel.

13:06.086 --> 13:08.455
Is this all the copies
of the paper you could get?

13:08.521 --> 13:10.423
I bought every one
the man had.

13:10.490 --> 13:12.826
He asked me if
I was gonna line a bird cage
for an ostrich.

13:15.362 --> 13:18.331
Oh, I'm so proud of the way
you're holding your ground,

13:18.398 --> 13:20.767
in spite of all the money
Wymac offered you.

13:20.834 --> 13:22.970
Well...

13:23.036 --> 13:26.673
I never thought I'd see
the day George Jefferson
turning down money. Ooh!

13:26.739 --> 13:30.010
Yeah, that's like a moth
turning down a closet
full of wool sweaters.

13:32.112 --> 13:33.446
You know something, Florence?

13:33.513 --> 13:37.050
Your trouble is you don't know
how generous I really am.

13:37.117 --> 13:38.485
I guess not.

13:38.551 --> 13:41.188
I've been judging you
by the size of my paycheck.

13:43.523 --> 13:48.195
I've heard that these battles
with corporations
can drag on and on.

13:48.261 --> 13:51.932
I know. That's why we need
a lot of publicity to
bring them to their knees.

13:51.999 --> 13:54.467
Yeah, that way you could look
them right in the eye.

13:57.204 --> 14:00.607
You know, some people
would hold out just
to drive up the price.

14:00.673 --> 14:03.076
-You're kidding?
-(PHONE RINGS)

14:03.143 --> 14:04.811
Hey, hold it, I'll get it.

14:05.645 --> 14:06.746
Hello...

14:06.813 --> 14:09.182
Oh, Leroy, what? What?

14:10.750 --> 14:14.387
Property Owners Association
want me? Huh?

14:14.454 --> 14:17.724
Oh, okay, okay.
I'll be right there.

14:17.790 --> 14:20.693
-(CLEARS THROAT)
-What's wrong, George?

14:20.760 --> 14:24.564
The other owners on the block
are angry because
I ain't selling. Damn.

14:24.631 --> 14:28.268
This being a hero is turning
into a full time job. Huh!

14:35.008 --> 14:37.744
He said he was gonna be here
in 30 minutes.
Now, where is he?

14:37.810 --> 14:39.579
Yeah, I bet he doesn't show.

14:39.646 --> 14:40.780
He's probably yellow.

14:40.847 --> 14:43.583
Mr. Jefferson?
Oh, no, he's black.

14:47.988 --> 14:49.489
Hey, Leroy, what's going on?

14:49.556 --> 14:52.092
Oh, Mr. Jefferson.
Man, I'm glad you're here.

14:52.159 --> 14:53.526
It's okay.
I'll handle this.

14:53.593 --> 14:56.096
Jefferson, we've been
waiting here an hour for you.

14:56.163 --> 14:58.831
Oh, really?
You should have had
your suits cleaned.

14:58.898 --> 15:01.534
You're already taking us
to the cleaners.

15:01.601 --> 15:03.971
I'm Jim Baker. I own
the Triple A Supermarkets.

15:04.037 --> 15:07.107
Hey, no kidding?
We got three of your
shopping carts out back.

15:07.174 --> 15:09.309
(CLEARS THROAT)

15:09.376 --> 15:12.679
I use them to haul around
the dirty clothes.

15:12.745 --> 15:14.881
Leroy, I said,
I'd handle this.

15:14.948 --> 15:17.250
I'm Bill Walters, Jefferson.
I own the apartment
building on the corner.

15:17.317 --> 15:20.220
We represent
all of the property owners
on this block.

15:20.287 --> 15:22.489
Well, you don't represent me.

15:22.555 --> 15:25.392
Well, that's why we're here.
Now, why aren't you with us
in this Wymac deal?

15:25.458 --> 15:27.794
Yeah, Jefferson,
there's a lot of money
to be made here.

15:27.860 --> 15:29.562
Ha! You can say that again.

15:29.629 --> 15:32.565
-So why are you lousing it up?
-I'm not lousing it up.

15:32.632 --> 15:34.767
Oh, you're not, huh?
Then what you call
what you're doing?

15:34.834 --> 15:36.836
It's called being a hero.

15:36.903 --> 15:38.471
Ain't you read the front page?

15:38.538 --> 15:40.373
Leroy, stick to the comics.

15:40.440 --> 15:42.375
Jefferson, what have you
got to say about
that article?

15:42.442 --> 15:44.611
I call it a smart
business move.

15:44.677 --> 15:47.480
Now, what is so smart
about turning down
a big profit?

15:47.547 --> 15:49.616
Holding out
for bigger profits.

15:49.682 --> 15:51.651
Jefferson, what's your game?

15:51.718 --> 15:54.921
Monopoly.
And I'm holding Boardwalk.

15:54.988 --> 15:56.523
And if Wymac wants it
bad enough,

15:56.589 --> 15:58.225
they're gonna have
to pay me for it.

15:58.291 --> 16:00.027
And I'm not talking
about play money.

16:00.093 --> 16:02.829
And what are we supposed
to be doing while
you're trying to up the ante?

16:02.895 --> 16:05.732
Look, we're all gonna
make money on this deal.

16:05.798 --> 16:07.667
Only I'm gonna make
more than you guys.

16:09.369 --> 16:12.805
Which is only fair
since I'm smarter
than you are.

16:12.872 --> 16:15.608
Now, if you guys don't mind,
I got business
to take care of.

16:15.675 --> 16:17.977
All right, Jefferson,
all right.
But just remember this.

16:18.045 --> 16:20.947
While you're holding
up Boardwalk,
none of us can pass go.

16:21.014 --> 16:22.949
Oh, oh, oh.

16:25.218 --> 16:26.886
* We're in the money...

16:26.953 --> 16:30.323
Mr. Jefferson,
I don't understand
all of this.

16:30.390 --> 16:32.292
Why? Ain't you never
played Monopoly?

16:32.359 --> 16:35.895
I mean, why did you tell
those guys you're gonna sell
when it says here you're not.

16:35.962 --> 16:38.165
Leroy, look,
don't believe everything
you read in the paper.

16:38.231 --> 16:40.067
You mean,
you're gonna take
Wymac's offer?

16:40.133 --> 16:42.102
No, I'm not gonna
take Wymac's offer.

16:42.169 --> 16:43.603
Then you're not gonna sell?

16:43.670 --> 16:45.605
Of course,
I'm gonna sell, dummy.

16:45.672 --> 16:47.740
But what about this article?

16:47.807 --> 16:49.142
Great publicity.

16:49.209 --> 16:51.644
The bigger hero I am,
the more Wymac has to pay.

16:52.212 --> 16:54.081
Oh, I get it.

16:54.147 --> 16:55.282
I think.

16:56.716 --> 16:59.286
It's called holding out.

16:59.352 --> 17:01.221
Didn't anybody ever
hold out on you before?

17:01.288 --> 17:03.923
Sure. Mary Lou Parker.

17:05.692 --> 17:08.661
She held out
all through high school.

17:08.728 --> 17:10.763
I'm talking about
holding out for money.

17:11.364 --> 17:13.533
So am I.

17:13.600 --> 17:16.603
Look, Leroy,
you are looking at a man

17:16.669 --> 17:21.174
who has one of the richest
corporations in the city
right where he wants them.

17:21.241 --> 17:24.511
-Where's that?
-In the palm of my hand.

17:24.577 --> 17:27.380
They already called me twice
and raised the offer
each time.

17:27.447 --> 17:30.083
Are you sure this idea
of yours is gonna work?

17:30.150 --> 17:32.819
Positive. Look,
let me tell you something.

17:32.885 --> 17:35.288
I'll bet you that before
this week is out,

17:35.355 --> 17:39.726
a man from Wymac is
gonna walk through that door
and make me a rich man.

17:39.792 --> 17:42.329
You're saying Mr. Woodley's
gonna come back here?

17:42.395 --> 17:45.265
-Yeah.
-Okay.

17:45.332 --> 17:48.000
-I bet you a dollar.
-Okay.

17:49.001 --> 17:51.371
You got yourself a bet.
(LAUGHING)

17:51.438 --> 17:55.308
George, you won't believe
who called the house.

17:55.375 --> 17:56.776
Sterling James!

17:58.044 --> 17:59.612
Who's Sterling James?

17:59.679 --> 18:01.948
Sterling James
is the newscaster.

18:02.014 --> 18:04.184
He's coming out here
to interview you.

18:04.251 --> 18:05.752
You're kidding?

18:05.818 --> 18:07.654
That means I'm gonna be
on television like Kojak.

18:07.720 --> 18:09.322
And Daffy Duck.

18:14.794 --> 18:16.529
Wait till Wymac sees me
on television.

18:16.596 --> 18:18.097
Then they'll know
who they're dealing with.

18:18.765 --> 18:20.867
Jefferson and Wymac.

18:20.933 --> 18:22.969
It's like David and Goliath.

18:23.035 --> 18:25.972
Oh, come on, Weezy,
Wymac is bigger than Goliath.

18:26.038 --> 18:28.775
And they also got more money,
right, Mr. Jefferson?

18:28.841 --> 18:30.777
Oh, what do you mean, Leroy?

18:30.843 --> 18:35.215
Oh, well what he means
is big corporations can
afford a big legal staffs.

18:35.282 --> 18:38.585
Oh, but George
isn't afraid of that.
Right, George?

18:38.651 --> 18:41.654
Well, Weezy, you never know
how things are gonna turn out.
(CHUCKLES)

18:41.721 --> 18:43.723
You're not afraid of
losing, are you?

18:43.790 --> 18:46.859
Well, you know how it is
in the business world.
It's dog eat dog.

18:46.926 --> 18:48.361
My dog eats liver.

18:53.233 --> 18:56.303
George, are you saying
Wymac could win?

18:56.369 --> 18:59.038
Well look, anything can happen
in business.

18:59.572 --> 19:01.374
But if they do,

19:01.441 --> 19:03.410
nobody can say that
George Jefferson
didn't put up a good fight.

19:03.476 --> 19:05.612
Oh, you're right, George.

19:05.678 --> 19:08.415
And I'm proud
to be in your corner.

19:08.481 --> 19:10.116
-Oh.
-(CHUCKLES)

19:12.051 --> 19:13.820
Excuse me, I'm looking
for Mr. Jefferson.

19:13.886 --> 19:15.222
That's me.

19:15.288 --> 19:16.756
Sterling James,
On The Spot News.

19:16.823 --> 19:19.025
But of course,
I'm sure you recognize me.

19:19.091 --> 19:22.161
Of course! Channel five
is the only channel I watch.

19:22.229 --> 19:24.931
-I'm on channel six.
-Oh.

19:24.997 --> 19:26.866
(CLEARS THROAT)
Yeah, what I mean is,

19:26.933 --> 19:29.436
channel five is
the only channel I watch,
when I'm not watching you.

19:29.502 --> 19:31.103
(LAUGHING)

19:31.170 --> 19:33.640
Oh, this is my lovely
wonderful wife, Louise.

19:33.706 --> 19:34.807
-How do you do?
-Hello.

19:34.874 --> 19:38.211
-(COUGHS)
-Oh yeah, and this is Leroy.

19:38.278 --> 19:41.147
I'd like to interview you
and your wife
for tonight's newscast.

19:41.214 --> 19:42.582
-Us?
-If you don't mind.

19:42.649 --> 19:45.585
Really? What a surprise.

19:45.652 --> 19:46.953
Well, sure,
I guess we have time.

19:47.019 --> 19:49.322
Great. Why don't you
just come right over here?

19:51.558 --> 19:54.694
Make sure you get
my good side, son.
(CLEARS THROAT)

19:56.896 --> 19:59.466
All right,
I think we're ready.
(CLEARS THROAT)

19:59.532 --> 20:01.568
Rolling.

20:01.634 --> 20:04.471
This is Sterling James,
coming to you from
a small store in Queens.

20:04.537 --> 20:06.005
It's not that small.

20:06.072 --> 20:09.609
I am speaking
with George Jefferson,
who owns this store,

20:09.676 --> 20:12.312
and who, in order
to prevent the destruction
of a neighborhood,

20:12.379 --> 20:15.548
has refused to sell his store
to a large corporation.

20:15.615 --> 20:19.185
Tell me, Mr. Jefferson,
how does it feel to be a hero?

20:19.252 --> 20:22.655
Well, you know, I guess
it's not much different
from any other hero.

20:22.722 --> 20:25.258
-Like, take Reggie Jackson,
for instance, now...
-(LAUGHS)

20:25.325 --> 20:28.428
Are you saying they're gonna
name a candy bar after you?

20:33.065 --> 20:36.035
Yes, well, Mrs. Jefferson,

20:36.102 --> 20:38.104
do you have any doubt
that your husband

20:38.170 --> 20:41.240
will have any problem
in holding out against Wymac

20:41.308 --> 20:43.976
and the lure of their
glittering pot of gold?

20:44.043 --> 20:45.244
Not for...

20:45.312 --> 20:47.013
Not for a moment.

20:47.079 --> 20:48.848
Hit it strong, Weez.

20:48.915 --> 20:52.852
My husband wouldn't sell
if they offered him
a million dollars.

20:52.919 --> 20:54.321
Not that strong.

20:56.823 --> 21:01.160
The Wymac Corporation
offered my husband
a lot of money to sell out.

21:01.227 --> 21:03.162
The pressure is terrible.

21:03.229 --> 21:04.364
How's he been handling it?

21:04.431 --> 21:07.066
Oh, he's laughing
at their offer.

21:09.268 --> 21:13.105
-Well, the offer is laughable.
-Yeah.

21:13.172 --> 21:17.844
Mrs. Jefferson, you're proof
that behind every successful
man, there's a woman.

21:17.910 --> 21:22.749
Won't you share with us
your feelings during this time
of mighty struggle?

21:22.815 --> 21:24.216
-Well, I feel...
-Mr. Jefferson...

21:24.283 --> 21:25.652
Not now.
We're on television.

21:25.718 --> 21:29.722
Mr. Jefferson,
I just wanted to
pay you your dollar.

21:29.789 --> 21:31.123
What dollar?

21:31.190 --> 21:33.793
Well, we bet a dollar
Mr. Woodley would come in.

21:33.860 --> 21:36.563
-Well, he did.
-Mr. Jefferson.

21:36.629 --> 21:39.265
Oh, excuse me.
(LAUGHING)

21:39.332 --> 21:42.335
That must be
an important customer.

21:42.402 --> 21:45.505
Oh, that ain't no customer.
That's Mr. Woodley
from Wymac.

21:45.572 --> 21:48.808
I'm Leroy Coffin.
I'm appearing
in my church in...

21:51.711 --> 21:53.546
Look, I can't talk about
business right now!

21:53.613 --> 21:55.582
I don't want everybody
to find out what
I've been doing!

21:55.648 --> 21:57.484
-Mr. Jefferson...
-Here we have,
here we have Mr. Woodley.

21:57.550 --> 22:01.087
A representative
of the company that
Mr. Jefferson is fighting.

22:01.153 --> 22:03.456
What are your feelings
about what Mr. Jefferson
is doing?

22:03.523 --> 22:05.191
He has no feelings
about it at all.

22:05.257 --> 22:07.627
Oh, but I do. Excuse me.

22:07.694 --> 22:09.962
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm Gerald Woodley,

22:10.029 --> 22:12.231
representative
of the Wymac Corporation.

22:12.298 --> 22:16.636
And I want to say that
we are proud of our devotion
to progress and humanity.

22:16.703 --> 22:18.304
Those are my exact feelings.

22:18.371 --> 22:20.907
And we at Wymac realize that
some people think of us

22:20.973 --> 22:22.975
as a large
and powerful corporation.

22:23.042 --> 22:24.977
One that can
roll over anybody.

22:25.044 --> 22:27.313
That's right.
But I'm just a small guy.

22:27.380 --> 22:30.983
I know when I've been licked.
Sorry, Weez.

22:31.050 --> 22:34.286
But once Mr. Jefferson
brought the plight
of the residents of this block

22:34.353 --> 22:38.357
to our attention
we knew we were doing
the wrong thing.

22:38.425 --> 22:39.792
Right... Say what?

22:41.961 --> 22:45.097
Are you saying that Wymac
is no longer interested
in this property?

22:45.164 --> 22:46.799
That is correct.

22:46.866 --> 22:49.936
Well, there you have it,
ladies and gentlemen.

22:50.002 --> 22:53.272
George Jefferson
has done it. He's won.

22:53.339 --> 22:56.876
This man has beaten
the corporation.
Congratulations.

22:59.746 --> 23:01.948
Uh, uh, uh...
Hey, wait, wait,
wait a minute.

23:02.014 --> 23:03.483
-I'll accept your offer.
-I'm sorry, Jefferson.

23:03.550 --> 23:05.718
-Okay, I'll accept
half the offer.
-Too late.

23:05.785 --> 23:07.253
-Why?
-All that publicity.

23:07.319 --> 23:09.822
-Publicity?
-Our company likes
to keep a low profile.

23:09.889 --> 23:11.991
All this notoriety
isn't good for our image.

23:12.058 --> 23:13.860
-Damn!
-I'm sorry we couldn't
do business.

23:13.926 --> 23:15.795
But, wait, wait.
How about one-quarter?

23:19.432 --> 23:21.067
And don't you ever come back!

23:24.504 --> 23:28.941
Oh, George,
I'm so proud of you.

23:29.008 --> 23:31.744
Indeed, Mr. Jefferson.
You are a real hero.

23:31.811 --> 23:33.846
Do you have anything
to say to our

23:33.913 --> 23:36.849
millions of people watching
this newscast tonight?

23:38.250 --> 23:40.352
Oh, yeah, I sure do.
(CLEARS THROAT)

23:41.788 --> 23:43.690
I'd like to announce

23:43.756 --> 23:47.426
a great Jefferson Cleaners
Hold Out Sale
at all seven locations.

23:47.494 --> 23:50.229
-Mr. Jefferson.
-Seven convenient locations
throughout the city.

23:50.296 --> 23:52.098
-Mr. Jefferson.
-One in Manhattan
on East Eighty...

23:52.164 --> 23:55.535
I'm Leroy Coffin.
I'm appearing
in my church in...

23:55.602 --> 23:58.004
-One in Harlem,
on 130th Street.
-Mr. Jefferson...

23:58.070 --> 24:01.373
And our really new redecorated
store in Staten Island.

24:01.440 --> 24:03.610
Come out, and I'll...

24:34.941 --> 24:39.746
LOUISE: The Jeffersons was
videotaped in front of
a studio audience.

24:39.812 --> 24:43.282
* Movin', movin' on up
