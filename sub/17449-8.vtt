WEBVTT

00:01.500 --> 00:03.583
Ohh. What a week.

00:03.667 --> 00:06.375
We traveled to another planet,
saved Skylar's life,

00:06.458 --> 00:08.792
and almost died
like five times.

00:08.875 --> 00:11.583
(sighs) It's nice to be back,
safe and sound.

00:13.083 --> 00:15.542
I'm bored.

00:15.625 --> 00:17.375
Don't distract me.

00:17.458 --> 00:20.458
I'm using a cheat code to get the
high score on this video game.

00:20.542 --> 00:21.709
(device chiming)

00:21.792 --> 00:23.709
Huh. I did it!

00:23.792 --> 00:26.959
The high score...
I achieved my life's goal!

00:28.417 --> 00:30.750
I'm bored.

00:32.041 --> 00:34.917
Kaz, you can't use a cheat code
to get the high score.

00:35.000 --> 00:36.458
That's cheating.

00:36.542 --> 00:40.667
Yeah. That's what
cheat codes are for... to cheat.

00:40.750 --> 00:42.625
Otherwise they'd have
a different name,

00:42.709 --> 00:45.834
like "honesty codes"
or...Larry Finkle.

00:45.917 --> 00:48.291
You need to be careful,
Kaz.

00:48.375 --> 00:51.583
Everything you do in life determines
what kind of a person you become.

00:51.667 --> 00:53.500
Today it's cheating
on a video game,

00:53.583 --> 00:55.000
tomorrow you cheat
on a test,

00:55.083 --> 00:58.208
next thing you know,
you're a homicidal maniac.

00:59.625 --> 01:02.792
Wow. That story took
a really dark turn.

01:02.875 --> 01:05.208
Look at me.
I do good deeds all the time,

01:05.291 --> 01:08.625
so who knows? I may grow up
to be president one day.

01:08.709 --> 01:11.750
I do have the perfect face
for being on money.

01:11.834 --> 01:13.834
Which looks better...
wig or no wig?

01:21.125 --> 01:24.500
Um... what the heck?

01:26.959 --> 01:29.166
-Who are you?
-I'm you. Kaz.

01:29.250 --> 01:30.875
From the future.

01:30.959 --> 01:32.166
'Sup.

01:32.250 --> 01:34.250
I'm here on
an important mission.

01:34.333 --> 01:36.083
Wh-Who are you really?

01:36.166 --> 01:38.166
I mean, sure,
you kind of look like Kaz,

01:38.250 --> 01:40.583
and you do look like
you're from the future,

01:40.667 --> 01:42.500
and you did just appear
out of nowhere...

01:42.583 --> 01:45.000
Okay, I buy it.

01:45.083 --> 01:47.333
No, no. I don't.

01:47.417 --> 01:49.125
How do I know
you're really me?

01:49.208 --> 01:51.250
I can do a terrible
impression of a robot.

01:51.333 --> 01:54.834
(mechanically) I am a robot.
Beep boop boop bramp bromp.

01:56.083 --> 01:58.041
You are me!

01:58.125 --> 01:59.625
This is so cool!

01:59.709 --> 02:02.333
And I am so glad
I'm not bald.

02:02.417 --> 02:05.041
That was a real concern.

02:05.125 --> 02:07.792
This is so weird.
I have so many questions.

02:07.875 --> 02:09.500
What's the future like?

02:09.583 --> 02:11.625
Pretty much exactly
the same as now.

02:11.709 --> 02:13.917
Except we're ruled
by giant insects.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.709
You know what, though?
They're actually doing a pretty good job.

02:17.792 --> 02:20.083
Anyway, I was sent here
to stop someone

02:20.166 --> 02:23.834
from turning into a villain in the future
and destroying the world.

02:23.917 --> 02:25.583
Cool!
So who's the villain?

02:25.667 --> 02:26.875
You are.

02:27.792 --> 02:29.083
Uh, what?

02:29.166 --> 02:30.875
Th-That's impossible.

02:30.959 --> 02:33.709
I-I have fancy
return address labels.

02:33.792 --> 02:36.083
What kind of villain has
fancy return address labels?

02:36.166 --> 02:38.583
-Slaughter Master?
-Slaughter Master?

02:38.667 --> 02:40.917
Fine. Other than Slaughter Master.

See this news report?

03:31.291 --> 03:33.542
This is Oliver
twenty-five years from now

03:33.625 --> 03:37.000
using a human body
as a canoe.

03:37.083 --> 03:39.458
(Kaz) Check out this headline:

03:39.542 --> 03:43.625
"Approval rating at all-time high
for George W. Bug."

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
So I really do
become a villain.

03:47.083 --> 03:48.583
Don't worry, Oliver.

03:48.667 --> 03:50.250
I work for the League of Heroes,

03:50.333 --> 03:53.208
and they sent me here to stop you
from doing the one thing

03:53.291 --> 03:55.208
that triggers the events
that turns you evil.

03:55.291 --> 03:58.333
Oh. Good.
S-So what's the one thing?

03:58.417 --> 03:59.792
Huh.

03:59.875 --> 04:02.667
Probably shoulda asked that
before I left.

04:02.750 --> 04:05.500
He is me.
I so would have done that.

04:05.583 --> 04:07.500
(both chuckle)

04:07.583 --> 04:09.667
Doesn't your computer
have the information?

04:09.750 --> 04:11.250
It doesn't give
all the details.

04:11.333 --> 04:13.542
It only confirms
if I've changed the future.

04:13.625 --> 04:15.291
Oh, and it also levitates!

04:15.375 --> 04:16.333
Watch.

04:19.333 --> 04:22.000
It doesn't always work.

04:22.083 --> 04:24.667
So how will you know
what to stop me from doing?

04:24.750 --> 04:26.542
I'll just use
my common sense.

04:26.625 --> 04:29.083
We're doomed.

04:29.166 --> 04:31.583
Wait. Since this thing I do

04:31.667 --> 04:33.917
that's supposed to turn me evil
happens today,

04:34.000 --> 04:36.333
I can just sit here
and do nothing,

04:36.417 --> 04:38.500
and it'll never happen.

04:38.583 --> 04:40.291
-(ding)
-It just happened.

04:40.375 --> 04:43.291
-What?
-Sitting on the gurney was the thing.

04:43.375 --> 04:45.667
You become a villain now.

04:45.750 --> 04:49.166
What?! No, that can't be. How could
that possibly make him a villain?

04:49.250 --> 04:52.166
Well, sitting on the gurney was only the
first link in a chain of events

04:52.250 --> 04:54.000
that leads to a life
of crime and destruction.

04:54.083 --> 04:55.375
Well, what's the next link?

04:55.458 --> 04:57.500
That. Asking that question.

04:58.875 --> 05:00.959
Pffft.
Followed by scoffing like that.

05:02.792 --> 05:05.208
So that's it?
M-My fate is sealed?

05:05.291 --> 05:06.959
I grow up to become a villain?

05:07.041 --> 05:09.500
Of course not!

05:09.583 --> 05:11.041
You won't grow up at all.

05:12.458 --> 05:14.500
See, if I wasn't able to stop you
from becoming a villain,

05:14.583 --> 05:17.083
Plan B of my mission
is to terminate you.

05:17.166 --> 05:18.500
(Kaz) Wow.

05:19.500 --> 05:20.792
I can't believe this.

05:20.875 --> 05:23.959
How did I get such a cool job
in the future?

05:27.500 --> 05:29.917
Uh...uh, hey, look!
Something shiny!

05:30.000 --> 05:31.375
-Ooh! Where?
-Ooh! Where?

05:34.125 --> 05:37.625
Okay, I don't see
anything shiny...

05:37.709 --> 05:39.333
-I do see a cockroach.
-(gasps)

05:39.417 --> 05:42.417
What are you doing?!
He could be president one day.

05:48.750 --> 05:51.083
It's so nice to
not be evil anymore.

05:51.166 --> 05:54.208
It's really freed up time
in my schedule to do my scrapbooking.

05:55.417 --> 05:57.542
I guess you don't have time
in your schedule to come up with

05:57.625 --> 05:59.208
more interesting stories.

06:01.583 --> 06:03.959
Hey, Mesmera!
How are you?

06:10.709 --> 06:12.959
Surge. Up top!

06:16.125 --> 06:18.417
Ohh!

06:18.500 --> 06:21.709
Philip, why is everyone mad at me?

06:21.792 --> 06:24.417
Well, you did try to annihilate
half the staff here...

06:24.500 --> 06:28.333
and succeeded in
annihilating the other half.

06:28.417 --> 06:32.333
Now our softball team
has no left side of the infield!

06:34.250 --> 06:36.417
Skylar, why are you so upset?

06:36.500 --> 06:37.750
This is great news!

06:37.834 --> 06:40.250
You're the most hated person
in all of Mighty Med now.

06:40.333 --> 06:42.041
Why is that great news?

06:42.125 --> 06:43.875
Because it used to be me.

06:59.792 --> 07:01.875
Oliver, why would we come
to The Domain?

07:01.959 --> 07:04.208
It's such an obvious place
for Future Me to look for us.

07:04.291 --> 07:06.917
No, it's so obvious that Future You

07:07.000 --> 07:09.291
would think that we would think
it was way too obvious,

07:09.375 --> 07:11.125
and that we'd never be
stupid enough to come here.

07:11.208 --> 07:13.291
I knew you'd come here.

07:13.375 --> 07:15.291
It was so obvious!

07:17.000 --> 07:19.041
You have three options
of what can happen next.

07:19.125 --> 07:20.750
You can be sucked
into a black hole,

07:20.834 --> 07:23.500
you can be hurled into a black hole,
or I can release you.

07:23.583 --> 07:25.083
Release me!

07:25.166 --> 07:26.834
Okay, I'll release you.

07:26.917 --> 07:28.375
Into a black hole.

07:29.750 --> 07:32.041
You paused on purpose!

07:32.125 --> 07:34.333
Kaz, please!
Talk to yourself!

07:34.417 --> 07:36.375
Convince Future You
not to terminate me!

07:36.458 --> 07:37.667
Okay, I'll do my best,

07:37.750 --> 07:40.792
but as you know, my best
is, like, D-plus, C-minus.

07:44.125 --> 07:46.583
(no audible dialogue)

07:54.041 --> 07:56.542
So he's not gonna
send me into a black hole?

07:56.625 --> 07:59.750
Ya know, actually
I forgot to ask about that.

07:59.834 --> 08:03.166
Then what was that
whole conversation about?

08:03.250 --> 08:07.375
Ah, well, he was upset that I
pointed my finger angrily like this.

08:07.458 --> 08:09.792
Said people in the future
do it like this.

08:09.875 --> 08:11.625
And I agreed.
I like his way better.

08:13.333 --> 08:16.375
Future Kaz, please!
Y-You don't want to do this!

08:16.458 --> 08:20.458
It's me! Oliver! Your best friend!
Your partner in crime!

08:20.542 --> 08:23.291
Actually, we haven't been best friends
since you became evil.

08:23.375 --> 08:27.083
And your partner in crime
is the villain Skullface.

08:27.166 --> 08:28.625
You're hilariously
mismatched.

08:28.709 --> 08:30.917
You like things to be neat,
and he...

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
has a skull for a face.

08:40.208 --> 08:41.625
Hey, Gamma Girl.

08:41.709 --> 08:42.583
Uhh!

08:45.208 --> 08:47.375
Wow! She only shoved me!

08:47.458 --> 08:50.375
She used to scramble
my insides with gamma rays.

08:50.458 --> 08:52.333
I'm so popular now!

08:55.542 --> 08:58.583
Skylar, what are you doing?

08:58.667 --> 09:02.083
I paid the Human Blade to make
free smoothies for everyone.

09:02.166 --> 09:05.583
That way, I won't be the most
hated person in Mighty Med anymore!

09:05.667 --> 09:07.500
What?! No!!!

09:07.583 --> 09:09.875
Uh, you can't!

09:09.959 --> 09:13.792
I mean, I wouldn't give everyone
free smoothies if I were you.

09:13.875 --> 09:17.083
Yeah, because you're stingy
and hate happiness.

09:17.166 --> 09:19.208
True...

09:19.291 --> 09:21.875
but the bigger issue is...

09:21.959 --> 09:23.667
people hate smoothies.

09:23.750 --> 09:26.417
They're too smooth
and too delicious,

09:26.500 --> 09:29.125
and people hate things
that are too much of anything.

09:29.208 --> 09:30.625
You're crazy.

09:30.709 --> 09:34.291
I'm too crazy,
and that's why people hate me.

09:34.375 --> 09:36.583
Or...used to.

09:38.709 --> 09:40.083
All right, everyone,

09:40.166 --> 09:43.291
the Human Blade will make you
all fresh smoothies! My treat!

09:43.375 --> 09:45.208
(approving chatter)

09:51.083 --> 09:52.542
-(whoosh)
-Uhh!

09:54.709 --> 09:57.291
(grunting, screaming)

10:02.125 --> 10:04.834
Skylar,
look what you did!

10:04.917 --> 10:06.875
Why did you push Surge like that?

10:06.959 --> 10:08.917
Someone could have lost
a body part...

10:09.000 --> 10:10.500
that doesn't grow back.

10:12.750 --> 10:14.750
No, no, no!
I didn't push Surge.

10:14.834 --> 10:18.917
I saw you. And you cut off
Solar Flare's ponytail!

10:19.000 --> 10:21.458
Now she looks like
a pony with no tail!

10:21.542 --> 10:23.000
That's standing on two legs!

10:23.083 --> 10:25.333
And wearing
a Solar Flare costume!

10:27.250 --> 10:29.792
(angry chatter)

10:37.917 --> 10:39.500
Please! Don't do this!

10:39.583 --> 10:41.125
I'll give you anything you want!

10:41.208 --> 10:42.333
You want money?

10:42.417 --> 10:43.959
Wig or no wig.

10:46.500 --> 10:48.542
You do look good
in a wig.

10:48.625 --> 10:49.875
But this is useless to me.

10:49.959 --> 10:51.750
We don't have money
in the future.

10:51.834 --> 10:54.375
It's a purely
pollen-based economy.

11:01.959 --> 11:04.083
-Hey! That was my...
-Hey! That was my...

11:04.166 --> 11:07.208
-second-favorite shirt!
-third-favorite shirt!

11:07.291 --> 11:08.291
Third-favorite shirt?

11:08.375 --> 11:10.333
Yeah, we get a really cool shirt
in eleventh grade.

11:10.417 --> 11:12.834
Cool! Something
to look forward to.

11:15.208 --> 11:17.709
-(beeping)
-Ah.

11:17.792 --> 11:20.083
Looks like spraying that shirt
has altered the future.

11:20.166 --> 11:22.458
Oliver doesn't grow up
to be a villain anymore!

11:22.542 --> 11:23.875
Ha! That's great!

11:23.959 --> 11:27.166
But now I'm a villain!

11:28.208 --> 11:29.500
Now if you'll excuse me,

11:29.583 --> 11:32.166
I have some unfinished business
to attend to.

11:32.250 --> 11:34.583
Starting with...

11:34.667 --> 11:36.917
buying this action figure!

11:42.667 --> 11:46.166
Now to wreak havoc
on the city!

11:50.250 --> 11:52.542
-(door slams)
-I'm a villain?

11:52.625 --> 11:53.875
This is terrible!

11:53.959 --> 11:55.208
I know.

11:55.291 --> 11:58.125
On the bright side,
you're gonna be rich.

11:58.208 --> 12:00.083
I bet in the future
that action figure

12:00.166 --> 12:02.542
is worth ten times
as much pollen.

12:07.792 --> 12:09.041
This is bad.

12:09.125 --> 12:10.834
I don't want to grow up
to be a villain!

12:10.917 --> 12:12.667
I want to grow up to be
one of those wacky guys

12:12.750 --> 12:14.792
who stands outside
car dealerships doing this!

12:17.750 --> 12:20.291
Those are just dancing
balloon men.

12:20.375 --> 12:21.291
They are?

12:23.375 --> 12:25.750
Man, this is the worst day ever.

12:27.291 --> 12:30.083
Um, Kaz. Your chin.

12:32.500 --> 12:33.875
You know what
this means?

12:33.959 --> 12:36.208
Yes. I have stubble.

12:36.291 --> 12:39.875
I have stubble.
This is the best day ever!

12:41.583 --> 12:45.041
But my shirt's still wet.
This is the worst day ever!

12:46.375 --> 12:48.542
Future You said
he had a score to settle.

12:48.625 --> 12:50.625
So where did he go?

12:50.709 --> 12:53.375
Kaz. Quick, think of
everything you hate.

12:53.458 --> 12:57.625
Do I have to?
You know I hate thinking.

12:57.709 --> 13:01.583
Right. And what place
makes you think?

13:02.917 --> 13:04.375
School!

13:09.542 --> 13:12.125
What are you doing?

13:12.208 --> 13:14.041
This place brought me
so much misery

13:14.125 --> 13:18.291
that I'm gonna tear down every Spirit Week
and pep rally poster in here!

13:19.709 --> 13:21.792
-That's it?
-And then send the entire school

13:21.875 --> 13:25.208
into a black hole and erase it
from the face of the Earth!

13:26.834 --> 13:29.333
Wow, we really do pause a lot.

13:31.083 --> 13:32.792
You can't destroy the school.

13:32.875 --> 13:35.333
There's a basketball game in the gym.
There're students here.

13:35.417 --> 13:38.875
I don't care. That's the Number Two trait
of being a villain:

13:38.959 --> 13:40.583
Not caring.

13:40.667 --> 13:42.792
I don't care
what Number One is.

13:51.834 --> 13:53.542
(yawns)

13:55.375 --> 13:57.083
You can't beat me.

13:57.166 --> 14:00.625
I'm you! I know every move
you've got.

14:02.291 --> 14:05.333
Yeah? Well, I know
your every weakness.

14:05.417 --> 14:06.917
(both grunting)

14:07.000 --> 14:09.750
-Ow! Watch the hair!
-Ow! Watch the hair!

14:13.125 --> 14:15.125
Hey, Lizard Man.
Hey, Surge.

14:19.625 --> 14:22.417
Wow! He only flicked
my forehead.

14:22.500 --> 14:26.458
He used to zap me with electricity
until my gums bled.

14:26.542 --> 14:28.125
Life is good.

14:28.208 --> 14:29.625
(growling)

14:31.625 --> 14:34.750
Skylar. What is that?

14:34.834 --> 14:38.375
I'm going to give presents to all the
superheroes and staff at Mighty Med.

14:38.458 --> 14:41.667
What?!
You can't do that!

14:41.750 --> 14:44.875
I mean, because it's impossible
to buy friends.

14:44.959 --> 14:47.458
Trust me. I've tried.

14:47.542 --> 14:50.667
Oh ho.
These aren't nice presents.

14:50.750 --> 14:53.667
I got people the most hurtful
gifts I could think of.

14:53.750 --> 14:55.834
For Horace...

14:55.917 --> 14:59.542
a video of bridges
being demolished.

14:59.625 --> 15:01.667
For Philip, a huge hat

15:01.750 --> 15:04.750
that'll make him think
his head is even tinier.

15:06.250 --> 15:10.000
But then people will hate you
more than they already do.

15:10.083 --> 15:11.458
I don't care.

15:11.542 --> 15:14.458
I had so much bad stuff
happen to me this year...

15:14.542 --> 15:17.291
losing my powers,
becoming evil,

15:17.375 --> 15:19.875
almost kissing Oliver...

15:19.959 --> 15:22.875
The only good thing in my life

15:22.959 --> 15:25.417
was all my friends
here at Mighty Med.

15:25.500 --> 15:28.458
And now I don't even have that.

15:28.542 --> 15:32.041
So if everyone's going
to hate me for no reason,

15:32.125 --> 15:34.750
I might as well give them
a real reason to hate me.

15:42.709 --> 15:45.834
She's miserable,
and it's all my fault.

15:45.917 --> 15:48.542
So this is what
guilt feels like.

15:48.625 --> 15:50.667
I don't like it!

15:55.542 --> 15:58.083
(both grunting)

15:58.166 --> 15:59.250
Oooh!

15:59.333 --> 16:00.667
Oh ho!

16:04.291 --> 16:05.500
Aha!
Aha!

16:12.166 --> 16:13.709
-Oh, nice.
-I know, right?

16:13.792 --> 16:14.959
Yes!

16:16.959 --> 16:18.041
Yaaaah!

16:25.041 --> 16:26.041
Kaz!

16:31.750 --> 16:34.417
This thing's fully charged.
Stay back or I'll use it!

16:34.500 --> 16:37.291
I have seen the future...

16:37.375 --> 16:41.500
and we're a villain.
Just accept it!

16:41.583 --> 16:44.667
Well, maybe I can't change you,
but I can stop you from hurting anyone.

16:48.709 --> 16:51.667
-What are you doing?
-I'm gonna send myself into a black hole.

16:51.750 --> 16:54.375
That way I won't exist anymore
in the present,

16:54.458 --> 16:56.041
and I won't become a villain
in the future.

16:56.125 --> 16:57.250
Kaz, don't!

16:57.333 --> 17:00.208
Oliver, he's threatening to destroy
the entire school.

17:00.291 --> 17:02.250
Do you know what's in that gym?

17:02.333 --> 17:04.625
Cheerleaders!

17:04.709 --> 17:07.667
Really hot cheerleaders!
I can't let that happen.

17:13.500 --> 17:15.375
-(whirring, beeping)
-Wait!

17:15.458 --> 17:16.792
There's news from the future.

17:20.500 --> 17:24.500
Ah. President George W. Bug
got reelected.

17:24.583 --> 17:26.583
Oh! And Kaz is no longer a villain.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.500
-I'm not?
-I'm not?

17:29.583 --> 17:33.500
-That is awesome!
-That is awesome!

17:33.583 --> 17:35.792
Wait. I don't understand.
What changed?

17:35.875 --> 17:38.083
Remember this morning
I told you everything you do

17:38.166 --> 17:40.250
determines what kind
of person you become?

17:40.333 --> 17:42.041
Well, you're not a villain anymore

17:42.125 --> 17:46.000
because you were willing
to sacrifice yourself to save others.

17:46.083 --> 17:47.458
Well, mostly cheerleaders.

17:49.417 --> 17:54.417
Okay, my work is done here.
I guess.

17:54.500 --> 17:57.917
I was never totally sure
what I was supposed to do.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.166
I'm so glad I got to meet you.

18:02.250 --> 18:04.000
Can't wait to grow up to be you.

18:04.083 --> 18:07.583
Thanks.
Can you do me one favor?

18:07.667 --> 18:11.750
Start flossing your teeth. You can't
imagine how much dental work we need.

18:13.333 --> 18:15.458
I can't make any promises.

18:17.750 --> 18:19.500
Well, there's my ride.

18:19.583 --> 18:22.750
Wait. Before you go,
I have one question.

18:22.834 --> 18:24.792
Now that I'm not a villain in the future,

18:24.875 --> 18:27.959
-what am I?
-I don't know...

18:28.041 --> 18:31.917
but it turns out your face is
actually on a five dollar bill.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.834
-Cool!
-Which we use to wipe our butts.

18:36.625 --> 18:39.500
Again with the pauses!

18:44.667 --> 18:47.709
Wow! What a day.
That was insane!

18:47.792 --> 18:51.250
I know. Just when I thought
our lives couldn't get any crazier.

18:53.625 --> 18:55.667
-I'm bored.
-I'm bored.

18:57.709 --> 19:00.166
Attention, everyone!

19:00.250 --> 19:02.917
I've called you all together
for this meeting because...

19:03.000 --> 19:05.834
Because I'm a maniac
and I must be stopped!

19:13.959 --> 19:15.166
-Aah...
-(glass breaking)

19:15.250 --> 19:17.667
Alan, what is wrong with you?

19:17.750 --> 19:21.375
I told you. I'm a maniac
and I must be stopped!

19:21.458 --> 19:24.917
No! I got everyone together
to give them those presents!

19:25.000 --> 19:26.750
Hey, don't try to stop me!

19:26.834 --> 19:28.000
But you just said,

19:28.083 --> 19:31.834
"I'm a maniac and
I must be stopped!"

19:31.917 --> 19:33.917
Well, I misspoke!

19:36.125 --> 19:37.291
(whoosh)

19:38.500 --> 19:40.000
Aaah!

19:44.667 --> 19:46.667
Argghh!

19:46.750 --> 19:49.041
What is wrong with you?!

19:49.125 --> 19:51.000
You didn't just
destroy our presents...

19:51.083 --> 19:53.750
you ruined all this
lovely wrapping paper!

19:53.834 --> 19:55.875
And these bows!

19:55.959 --> 19:58.417
You, sir, are a monster!

20:17.667 --> 20:19.750
Alan, I know what you did.

20:19.834 --> 20:24.041
The elevator smelled that way
when I got on. I swear!

20:24.125 --> 20:26.125
I know you didn't want
everyone to keep hating me

20:26.208 --> 20:30.000
so you took the bullet yourself.
And the darts.

20:30.083 --> 20:31.750
And whatever
that guy is throwing.

20:35.583 --> 20:37.542
I know you like to act
all mean and tough,

20:37.625 --> 20:41.291
but deep down, you're
kind of a sweetheart.

20:41.375 --> 20:43.166
(scoffs)
I'm not a sweetheart.

20:43.250 --> 20:46.333
I said "kind of" a sweetheart!

20:46.417 --> 20:48.458
I don't know what
you're talking about.

20:48.542 --> 20:50.458
I did this because...

20:50.542 --> 20:53.750
people should do what they're good at,
and I'm good at being hated.

20:53.834 --> 20:58.625
Well, just know that even if now you're
the most hated person here,

20:58.709 --> 21:00.333
not everybody hates you.

21:07.542 --> 21:09.458
Uhh! Uhh! Oohh!

21:09.542 --> 21:11.417
Aaah! Uhh!

21:12.875 --> 21:15.625
Huh. I did kind of miss that.

21:18.792 --> 21:21.792
(theme music playing)

21:41.875 --> 21:43.291
(boing)
