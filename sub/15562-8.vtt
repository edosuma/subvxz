WEBVTT

00:02.121 --> 00:03.656
Oh hey Adam.

00:03.859 --> 00:05.401
- How ya doing? Jonah. 
- Hey!

00:05.580 --> 00:06.930
It's cool. Bring it on in!

00:06.931 --> 00:08.071
Okay, watch the tin.

00:08.073 --> 00:09.620
Oh, I didn't mean to...

00:09.621 --> 00:11.489
I stumbled on the ladder
and I fell into your hair.

00:11.523 --> 00:12.724
- I wasn't trying to kiss you.
- Oh, yeah.

00:12.791 --> 00:14.525
- I didn't think it was a kiss.
- Cool.

00:14.560 --> 00:16.327
Yeah. I'm here to pick up Amy.

00:16.361 --> 00:18.696
All right. Husband picking up the wife.

00:18.731 --> 00:21.499
Classic.

00:21.533 --> 00:23.916
Uh, how's your, uh,
barbecue business going?

00:23.917 --> 00:25.384
Oh, it didn't work out.

00:25.418 --> 00:27.519
- Oh. I'm sorry, buddy.
- Yeah.

00:27.554 --> 00:30.856
Hey, you know, uh,
we... we might still be looking

00:30.890 --> 00:32.256
for some seasonal help if you're...

00:32.292 --> 00:33.959
you're looking for a gig, you know?

00:34.027 --> 00:36.762
Wow. Yeah. That's not a bad idea.

00:36.796 --> 00:38.197
What's not a bad idea?

00:38.231 --> 00:39.531
Uh, working here.

00:39.566 --> 00:41.767
Jonah says you're hiring.

00:41.801 --> 00:44.436
Oh, um...

00:44.486 --> 00:46.768
- That is not a bad idea.
- Mm-hmm.

00:46.769 --> 00:48.903
But I think we're all full up.

00:50.105 --> 00:52.040
Yeah. Yep.

00:52.074 --> 00:53.908
- Yes, we are all full.
- Yeah...

00:53.943 --> 00:55.743
Uh, but you just said... Full of what?

00:55.778 --> 00:57.712
- Seasonal help.
- But we're not hiring.

00:57.746 --> 00:58.478
- Hey, Glenn?
- Hmm?

00:58.479 --> 01:00.612
- We hiring seasonals?
- No, we're all full.

01:00.647 --> 01:02.482
God, I'm so pissed, Glenn.

01:02.516 --> 01:03.683
I mean, I've been here so long

01:03.750 --> 01:05.585
and you can't even make
an exception for me?

01:05.619 --> 01:07.787
I can't. I'm... I'm sorry.

01:07.821 --> 01:08.788
Come on, Glenn!

01:08.822 --> 01:10.523
- No exceptions.
- Oh, it's okay.

01:10.591 --> 01:12.258
It's just the way they do things here.

01:12.292 --> 01:15.428
No, no, you're right.
I should make an exception.

01:15.462 --> 01:17.196
Yeah, but you're all full up and that...

01:17.264 --> 01:18.598
- Welcome aboard.
- Thank you.

01:18.632 --> 01:19.632
Glad to have you.

01:19.666 --> 01:21.173
Amy, you owe me one.

01:22.603 --> 01:24.604
Awesome! This'll be fun!

01:24.638 --> 01:27.469
- Ultra cool!
- I'm so excited about this.

01:28.488 --> 01:31.767
- Synced and corrected by hawken45 -
- www.addic7ed.com -

01:32.439 --> 01:34.107
It has always been the manager's spot.

01:34.141 --> 01:35.375
I want you to stop parking in it.

01:35.409 --> 01:36.643
There is no such thing
as the manager's spot...

01:36.710 --> 01:38.578
There is.

01:38.612 --> 01:42.048
The manager's spot is the one
that says "The Manager."

01:42.082 --> 01:43.216
Are you done?

01:43.250 --> 01:44.550
Excuse me. All right, thank you.

01:44.585 --> 01:47.387
I'm just trying to get away
from that guy's boner.

01:47.421 --> 01:50.256
Okay, everyone. Good morning!

01:50.291 --> 01:53.419
Let's settle down. Um, 'tis the season.

01:53.420 --> 01:56.022
And I'd like to give a permanent welcome

01:56.091 --> 01:59.793
to all our new temporary workers
in the light blue vests.

01:59.828 --> 02:02.296
Now, I haven't put all the
faces to the names yet,

02:02.330 --> 02:04.856
but I do know that you are Reggie

02:04.857 --> 02:07.359
and... and we now have a Black Todd.

02:07.393 --> 02:08.860
Nope, you'll just be Todd.

02:08.895 --> 02:10.862
Uh, you'll be White Todd? Thank you.

02:10.896 --> 02:14.633
And, uh, oh, and this
sweetheart here is Opal,

02:14.667 --> 02:16.568
who, at 90 years old, I think is

02:16.636 --> 02:18.704
the oldest employee we've ever had.

02:21.365 --> 02:24.334
Oh, and lastly, let's give
a big Cloud 9 welcome

02:24.368 --> 02:27.604
to Amy's better half, Adam Dubanowski.

02:29.540 --> 02:30.840
Yeah?

02:30.875 --> 02:32.609
No, babe, nobody else gave a speech.

02:32.676 --> 02:34.544
No, it's cool, babe. It's cool.

02:34.578 --> 02:36.846
Um, I just wanted to tell
you all not to treat me

02:36.881 --> 02:39.382
any differently just 'cause
I'm sleeping with the boss.

02:41.585 --> 02:43.678
He means Amy, not me. I'm not gay.

02:45.053 --> 02:47.112
Anyway, if you have
any questions about Amy,

02:47.113 --> 02:47.922
come see me.

02:47.956 --> 02:48.956
I've got all the dirt.

02:49.024 --> 02:50.224
Seriously?

02:50.259 --> 02:52.226
Oh, right. Sorry, Bean.

02:52.261 --> 02:54.128
All right, uh, moving on.
Tornado safety...

02:54.196 --> 02:55.429
Whoa, whoa, whoa, not moving on.

02:55.464 --> 02:57.231
I want to know why
you just called her Bean.

02:57.266 --> 02:58.599
No, it's nothing.

02:58.634 --> 03:00.825
Is it because you like to eat beans?

03:00.987 --> 03:02.387
Is it because you fart a lot?

03:02.388 --> 03:04.055
Like this gentleman sitting next to me?

03:04.056 --> 03:06.190
It's 'cause I'm small, okay?

03:06.191 --> 03:08.003
When we first got together,
it was so cute,

03:08.003 --> 03:08.991
the way she'd sleep.

03:08.992 --> 03:10.624
Just like my little naked bean.

03:11.660 --> 03:12.760
Stop. Please, can you stop?

03:12.794 --> 03:13.794
They like it.

03:13.829 --> 03:15.596
Okay, well, any more questions?

03:17.000 --> 03:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:30.246 --> 03:32.848
Oh, don't worry.
I'll clean that up for you.

03:33.135 --> 03:34.836
Ugh, what is the point of these people?

03:34.904 --> 03:37.005
They're so bad, they make
Jonah look competent.

03:37.073 --> 03:38.174
I know.

03:38.241 --> 03:39.453
This is the grimmest year ever.

03:39.454 --> 03:40.655
I got a buck that says Pornstache

03:40.690 --> 03:42.357
is gone before lunch.

03:42.425 --> 03:44.292
No way, my money's on Ladybutt.

03:44.327 --> 03:45.460
You want in on this action?

03:45.495 --> 03:47.462
Uh, nope, I will not be betting

03:47.497 --> 03:49.431
on people losing their jobs.

03:49.465 --> 03:50.799
Quitting their jobs.
And they're not people.

03:50.833 --> 03:52.100
- They're temps.
- Come on.

03:52.135 --> 03:53.802
I mean, we always lose a
few on the first day.

03:53.836 --> 03:55.871
It's good, clean fun,
like the Myrtle death pool.

03:55.938 --> 03:57.639
That thing's been going on for 20 years.

03:57.673 --> 03:59.674
Yeah, I...

03:59.709 --> 04:01.643
I shouldn't gamble.

04:01.677 --> 04:03.575
I used to get a little carried away.

04:03.576 --> 04:05.408
Oh, I'm Jonah.

04:05.443 --> 04:07.177
I'm too proper to gamble.

04:07.211 --> 04:09.045
- Where's me monocle?
- Mm-kay.

04:09.080 --> 04:10.380
Oh, Hi, I'm Jonah.

04:10.414 --> 04:12.215
I eat macadamia nuts out of jar

04:12.250 --> 04:14.117
inside of other jar.

04:14.185 --> 04:15.585
Right?

04:15.620 --> 04:17.601
No, what? No, not "right."
What was that?

04:17.601 --> 04:19.435
Okay, all right,
I'll take the... the one

04:19.475 --> 04:21.576
with the dermatological...

04:21.603 --> 04:22.311
Rashface?

04:22.312 --> 04:24.478
Rashface. I'll take
one buck on Rashface.

04:24.513 --> 04:27.016
Da! One ruble from fur hat

04:27.032 --> 04:28.884
for glory of Soviet Union!

04:28.980 --> 04:30.548
What are you doing? He's not Russian.

04:30.552 --> 04:33.437
Yeah, well, he's not British either.

04:36.058 --> 04:37.792
Would you mind helping out?

04:39.528 --> 04:42.530
Just finishing this chapter.

04:45.701 --> 04:49.136
Sorry, she just...
she loves that book, so...

04:50.922 --> 04:52.356
- Hey.
- Hi.

04:52.507 --> 04:54.842
Can you maybe not tell
any more personal things

04:54.876 --> 04:56.510
about me to my coworkers?

04:56.545 --> 04:59.065
It just kind of makes it hard
for me to be the boss.

04:59.065 --> 05:01.267
Yeah, sure. No problem.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.269
- Okay, thank you. Thanks.
- Okay. You're welcome.

05:03.303 --> 05:04.937
I really appreciate it.

05:11.645 --> 05:15.314
Hey, Adam, why don't you
maybe move these boxes closer...

05:15.382 --> 05:18.317
- Please don't criticize me.
- What? I'm not criticizing you.

05:18.385 --> 05:19.718
- It sounds like criti...
- What are you talking about?

05:19.753 --> 05:21.387
You can't just say that...
Telling me what to do.

05:21.421 --> 05:22.721
Every time I open my mouth...

05:22.756 --> 05:24.456
You're taking advantage
of me as an underling.

05:25.725 --> 05:27.660
This is the first year that we're having

05:27.727 --> 05:29.685
an in-store Santa, so I am taking

05:29.686 --> 05:32.587
the selection process very seriously.

05:32.656 --> 05:34.824
Well, I've had a lot of experience.

05:34.858 --> 05:36.592
- Good.
- I've Claused a number

05:36.660 --> 05:38.094
- of department stores.
- Okay.

05:38.161 --> 05:41.530
And I-I was trained by Wayne Gunderson.

05:41.565 --> 05:43.432
- Way...
- Uh, he's a Santa Claus

05:43.500 --> 05:45.000
at the Chicago Macy's.

05:45.035 --> 05:46.102
Oh, wow!

05:46.169 --> 05:47.570
He's a legend.

05:47.604 --> 05:50.039
You sound really qualified.

05:50.073 --> 05:51.874
Well...

05:51.908 --> 05:53.743
Is that it? Is that the laugh?

05:53.777 --> 05:56.779
That's it, yeah.

05:56.847 --> 05:58.848
Oh, my God. Oh, wow.

05:58.882 --> 06:00.950
Well, so I have the job?

06:01.017 --> 06:04.186
Well, not yet, my fat red friend.

06:13.376 --> 06:15.043
'Ello, 'ello, 'ello, Mr. Jonah.

06:15.077 --> 06:16.711
- Hey.
- Looks like you won.

06:16.746 --> 06:19.047
- What?
- Your buddy Rashface?

06:19.081 --> 06:20.682
He found a used condom
in the dressing room

06:20.716 --> 06:22.135
and just walked out the store.

06:22.136 --> 06:24.537
- Congratulations.
- Wow, that's great. That's...

06:24.604 --> 06:26.472
I mean, that's really... that's too bad

06:26.506 --> 06:28.841
about his job, but, uh,
I had a feeling about that guy.

06:28.875 --> 06:31.377
You know, just...
just, like, a really...

06:31.444 --> 06:33.145
a really good feeling.

06:33.180 --> 06:34.900
Okay, well, enjoy that two bucks.

06:34.900 --> 06:37.701
Oh, yeah, I'm gonna.

06:37.735 --> 06:38.768
Hey, uh, you know what?

06:38.836 --> 06:40.003
We should... we should do another round.

06:40.037 --> 06:41.538
- What do you say?
- Okay, sure.

06:41.572 --> 06:43.006
Yeah, yeah, just, like, uh...

06:43.040 --> 06:44.040
just get some more people involved,

06:44.074 --> 06:45.275
you know, raise the stakes.

06:45.342 --> 06:48.344
Oh! Oh, hey! Uh, we should do a pool.

06:50.080 --> 06:51.080
I won.

06:51.115 --> 06:52.582
Congratulations.

06:52.616 --> 06:55.285
Out of over a dozen applicants,

06:55.352 --> 06:57.720
you're the super six who made it past

06:57.755 --> 07:00.290
the grueling yet simple
Megan's Law search.

07:00.364 --> 07:02.417
So let's get...

07:02.460 --> 07:04.577
Oops, sorry. Excuse me. One sec.

07:06.141 --> 07:09.543
Richard, I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to ask you to leave.

07:14.453 --> 07:15.968
Look, why don't you just try

07:15.969 --> 07:17.396
to move the boxes closer to the shelf

07:17.396 --> 07:18.796
and see if that doesn't make it easier?

07:18.831 --> 07:20.598
You mean do it your way.

07:20.632 --> 07:23.134
No, I mean do it the way
literally anybody

07:23.168 --> 07:24.602
older than 12 would do this.

07:24.636 --> 07:25.837
Is this about the dishes?

07:25.904 --> 07:27.079
This has nothing to do with the dishes.

07:27.079 --> 07:31.015
- I was letting them soak, I...
- You can't soak cast iron!

07:31.051 --> 07:34.189
Well, stop buying pans
that I can't get wet!

07:35.088 --> 07:38.323
Uh, it's a...
it's a professional dispute.

07:38.358 --> 07:40.325
Bean to customer service.

07:40.360 --> 07:42.728
Bean, you are wanted
in customer service...

07:42.762 --> 07:44.656
preferably with your clothes on.

07:45.832 --> 07:47.866
Thank you for that.

07:48.949 --> 07:51.162
Ignore me. Just doing some research.

07:51.660 --> 07:55.863
Okay, smiling.
You're not going anywhere.

07:55.898 --> 07:56.899
Excuse me, sir?

07:56.900 --> 07:58.100
Uh, just out of curiosity,

07:58.134 --> 08:00.936
how long were you at your previous job?

08:00.970 --> 08:02.577
- Uh, 25 years.
- Oh.

08:02.577 --> 08:04.911
You know, it's an interesting
story, actually.

08:04.946 --> 08:06.746
My father started out
as a baker, so I...

08:06.781 --> 08:09.082
- It is interesting.
- Oh, my God.

08:09.116 --> 08:13.053
Are you kidding me?
Are you out of your mind?

08:13.087 --> 08:16.456
- Stupid bitch.
- Excuse me, sir?

08:16.524 --> 08:17.436
Yeah, what?

08:17.437 --> 08:18.703
I just couldn't help but notice

08:18.737 --> 08:20.538
you're getting a little
frustrated over here.

08:20.572 --> 08:23.408
Oh, a little? How about
I'm this close to quitting?

08:23.442 --> 08:27.545
Oh, well, we will be
sorry to lose you...

08:27.579 --> 08:28.613
Isaac.

08:28.681 --> 08:31.549
20 bucks on Isaac the Ginger Giant.

08:31.583 --> 08:33.551
Man, this is intense.

08:33.585 --> 08:35.787
I didn't even know we sold
dry erase boards this big.

08:35.854 --> 08:36.888
Bought it at a different store.

08:36.922 --> 08:38.890
- Who's next?
- So we just pick one?

08:38.924 --> 08:41.390
It's a pari-mutuel
betting pool with live odds,

08:41.390 --> 08:43.791
no rake, and I'm open
to exotic bets, okay?

08:43.859 --> 08:47.428
You know, exactas, trifectas,
quadrellas, or "quaddies."

08:47.463 --> 08:49.697
Or we could all just pick one.

08:49.732 --> 08:51.566
- Oh, yes.
- Pick one, nice.

08:51.600 --> 08:54.202
Fine, so whoever's temp
quits first takes the pot?

08:54.236 --> 08:55.570
Okay, cool. I mean, I...

08:55.604 --> 08:57.105
I worked out all the odds,
I guess, for nothing.

08:57.139 --> 08:59.107
But I had fun doing it, so good times.

08:59.141 --> 09:00.141
Who's next?

09:00.142 --> 09:01.809
Hey, Glenn. Excuse me.

09:01.810 --> 09:03.553
Um, do you have a sec to talk?

09:03.554 --> 09:04.854
Oh, yeah, sure.

09:04.888 --> 09:06.389
Now's a good time.

09:06.456 --> 09:07.673
Um, here?

09:09.459 --> 09:11.294
- You're hurting my leg.
- Okay, look.

09:11.328 --> 09:12.628
You're gonna have to get used to that.

09:12.663 --> 09:14.819
We get a lot of little porkers up here.

09:15.735 --> 09:17.068
Yeah, go on.

09:17.198 --> 09:19.299
Well, I was just wondering

09:19.300 --> 09:20.834
if there was any way
that we could switch around

09:20.835 --> 09:23.103
Adam's schedule just so that
we're not on the same shifts.

09:23.104 --> 09:24.805
You know, just 'cause I feel like it...

09:24.806 --> 09:26.107
Okay. Say no more.

09:26.577 --> 09:27.995
I totally get it, okay?

09:27.996 --> 09:30.892
I-I was actually surprised
you wanted him to work here,

09:30.892 --> 09:32.893
seeing how things are
with your marriage.

09:32.927 --> 09:34.228
How things are with my marriage?

09:34.262 --> 09:36.263
- How things are with your...
- What does that mean?

09:36.297 --> 09:37.898
Not that things are bad.

09:37.932 --> 09:40.567
You know, just that you've been
married a long time,

09:40.602 --> 09:43.937
- so maybe the spark is gone, or...
- What?

09:43.972 --> 09:45.372
No, no, I mean
maybe you hit a rough patch.

09:45.407 --> 09:46.974
Okay, no, no, Glenn. That's worse.

09:47.042 --> 09:49.001
Okay, um, you know what?
Don't listen to me.

09:49.001 --> 09:50.535
I don't know what I'm
talking about, you know.

09:50.602 --> 09:53.371
But I do know I got to
get back to sitting.

09:54.339 --> 09:56.340
Um... okay.

09:56.375 --> 09:58.676
- Well, thank you.
- Yeah.

10:04.049 --> 10:06.717
Well, you were absolutely no help there.

10:06.785 --> 10:08.186
Amy's husband.

10:08.220 --> 10:11.656
- Who else?
- I got $20 on the old bitch.

10:11.690 --> 10:13.157
I got her listed as "Old Lady,"

10:13.192 --> 10:14.692
but I got you, Myrtle.

10:14.726 --> 10:16.661
- Who else is left?
- Uh, let's see.

10:16.687 --> 10:19.322
We have Unibrow, Unibrow 2,

10:19.364 --> 10:21.968
Short Guy Tall Hair, and Booklady.

10:21.969 --> 10:22.935
Oh, I'll take Booklady.

10:22.970 --> 10:25.600
No, I wanted her. I hate her.

10:25.601 --> 10:27.306
I hate her too. Splitsies.

10:27.374 --> 10:28.808
- Yes.
- All right!

10:28.876 --> 10:31.778
The joy of sport,
bringing people together.

10:32.207 --> 10:34.881
Which temp will quit next?

10:43.791 --> 10:46.259
And that's it next to
a golf ball just for scale.

10:46.293 --> 10:48.761
- Oh.
- That polyp is huge, right?

10:48.796 --> 10:50.329
Glenn said the weirdest thing to me.

10:50.397 --> 10:52.098
Okay, I guess it's Amy time now.

10:52.132 --> 10:53.266
- She does that.
- Yeah.

10:53.300 --> 10:55.101
He was like, "I'm surprised you wanted

10:55.135 --> 10:58.337
Adam to work here, given 'how things are

10:58.405 --> 11:00.273
in your marriage."

11:02.943 --> 11:06.145
Crazy.

11:06.180 --> 11:07.814
- Shh.
- I know.

11:07.848 --> 11:08.915
It's crazy.

11:11.224 --> 11:12.658
Right?

11:12.692 --> 11:15.361
- Shh.
- Ow.

11:15.395 --> 11:16.729
I'm not uncomfortable.

11:16.796 --> 11:19.698
I just keep thinking of funny things.

11:19.733 --> 11:22.635
Anyways, uh, I... I'm gonna go.

11:23.837 --> 11:26.538
- I'll come too.
- Sorry.

11:26.573 --> 11:29.408
Oh, no. There's no one
to make an announcement.

11:32.245 --> 11:34.213
Why are there all these chairs?

11:34.247 --> 11:36.682
Stupid temps.

11:39.183 --> 11:40.851
Look, the reason
they're all eager to get away

11:40.885 --> 11:42.853
is because they all agree with Glenn.

11:42.887 --> 11:45.489
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

11:45.523 --> 11:47.124
Good girl talk.

11:53.287 --> 11:55.355
I was just opening up
some shampoo boxes,

11:55.389 --> 11:57.390
and I think I extended
my box cutter too much.

11:57.425 --> 12:00.260
So it's kind of a mess.
Who do I call to clean that up?

12:00.294 --> 12:02.562
You. You call you.

12:02.594 --> 12:03.481
Okay.

12:03.482 --> 12:05.585
Well, sorry I don't know
how everything works here,

12:05.586 --> 12:07.151
considering I just started, and the...

12:07.185 --> 12:10.488
I mean, I-I haven't even been
trained on the box cutter, so...

12:12.858 --> 12:14.225
- What was that for?
- Nothing.

12:14.293 --> 12:15.559
Just felt like kissing you.

12:15.627 --> 12:19.397
Oh, I guess I should
start using this shampoo, huh?

12:24.036 --> 12:26.203
That's... you're so funny.

12:26.238 --> 12:27.471
I am from the future.

12:29.174 --> 12:32.678
I am Shampoo Man. I'm coming to get you.

12:32.678 --> 12:33.711
- I...
- Okay.

12:33.779 --> 12:35.179
I don't get it, but it's great.

12:35.214 --> 12:37.849
It's a shampoo... he's a Shampoo Man.

12:37.883 --> 12:39.183
Love you.

12:39.218 --> 12:41.052
Shampoo Man!

12:47.492 --> 12:50.327
Oh, well, that looks like absolute crap.

12:50.362 --> 12:52.396
- Hey. Hey.
- Yeah?

12:52.464 --> 12:54.365
- How's it going?
- Not good.

12:54.399 --> 12:55.633
Listen, so, um,

12:55.667 --> 12:57.234
I'm not supposed to tell you this,

12:57.302 --> 12:58.836
but it's actually after 3:00,

12:58.870 --> 13:02.406
so if you quit now, they got
to pay you for a full day.

13:02.474 --> 13:03.541
- Okay.
- Huh?

13:03.575 --> 13:05.009
Yeah, thanks, but, uh, I need to stop

13:05.043 --> 13:07.028
quitting everything
just because it's hard.

13:07.029 --> 13:08.028
Right, right, right.

13:08.062 --> 13:09.362
But you... you said you were gonna quit,

13:09.397 --> 13:11.398
so now... now is the time.

13:11.466 --> 13:12.966
- Whatever.
- No, no, no, no!

13:13.000 --> 13:14.913
Not whatever. Not whatever!

13:15.007 --> 13:16.236
No, you... you made a promise,

13:16.304 --> 13:19.483
and, uh, I personally would rather

13:19.640 --> 13:22.209
be a quitter than a liar, so...

13:22.243 --> 13:23.643
Maybe I'm just crazy.

13:23.678 --> 13:25.245
Maybe.

13:29.565 --> 13:30.665
Hey.

13:30.685 --> 13:31.702
My name's Jonah.

13:31.702 --> 13:34.838
I couldn't possibly wager
on people quitting their jobs.

13:34.872 --> 13:36.673
Well, you started it, so...

13:36.707 --> 13:38.174
No, what I started

13:38.209 --> 13:39.843
was a simple wager
where no one got hurt.

13:40.094 --> 13:42.062
You were trying to make him quit,

13:42.196 --> 13:43.712
which is so much more awesome.

13:43.780 --> 13:45.614
I wish I would have
thought of it sooner.

13:45.648 --> 13:47.683
I wasted a lot of good years.

13:47.717 --> 13:49.551
So the bet's still on?

13:49.619 --> 13:51.220
It's on like Kublai Khan.

13:51.287 --> 13:53.431
You have to be ready for anything

13:53.431 --> 13:57.935
because the questions are gonna
be coming fast and furious.

13:57.969 --> 14:00.504
Like, "How can you deliver presents

14:00.538 --> 14:02.439
to billions of children in one night?"

14:02.473 --> 14:04.508
- Santa One.
- Elves.

14:04.542 --> 14:07.110
Elves? No. Elves make the presents.

14:07.145 --> 14:09.947
- By Christmas, their job's done.
- Whoo! Whoo!

14:09.981 --> 14:12.015
Hi, Glenn! He's a horse!

14:12.050 --> 14:14.885
- I'm a horse!
- Go! Go!

14:16.797 --> 14:20.633
Okay, uh, let's talk about
dealing with the Jewish kids.

14:20.667 --> 14:22.075
Hey, man, what you into?

14:22.075 --> 14:23.309
What do you love? What do you hate?

14:23.344 --> 14:24.477
Let's do hate first.

14:24.512 --> 14:27.013
Uh, I hate war.

14:27.081 --> 14:30.584
Ooh, well, that's a bold stance.

14:30.618 --> 14:32.519
How about more like...
how about this place?

14:32.587 --> 14:34.421
What's the worst part
about working here?

14:34.455 --> 14:36.397
I guess not seeing my son all day.

14:37.293 --> 14:38.527
That'll work.

14:43.264 --> 14:44.361
Mm, hey, white girl.

14:44.361 --> 14:47.530
You looking real good today.

14:49.719 --> 14:51.120
I want this whole floor sparkling.

14:51.189 --> 14:52.889
The floor? You mean the ground?

14:52.924 --> 14:53.890
Heck yeah, I do.

14:53.925 --> 14:55.592
Or if you don't like it,

14:55.626 --> 14:57.627
you're also welcome to quit.

15:03.401 --> 15:04.940
You're actually doing it.

15:06.804 --> 15:07.301
Wow.

15:08.590 --> 15:09.991
I just got sexually harassed.

15:10.059 --> 15:12.927
Oh, my gosh. I'm so sorry.

15:12.961 --> 15:14.937
I really hope you're okay.

15:16.098 --> 15:19.767
- Because you feel great.
- Okay.

15:25.571 --> 15:26.804
Come in, come in, quick.

15:26.839 --> 15:29.474
Oh, oh, I remember this place.

15:29.508 --> 15:31.676
Yeah, remember we used to...

15:32.411 --> 15:33.745
Whoa, whoa.

15:33.779 --> 15:35.947
What's making you so hot
and heavy all of a sudden?

15:36.015 --> 15:37.048
It's not all of a sudden.

15:37.083 --> 15:38.950
You just look really cute in this vest.

15:42.588 --> 15:44.122
- Ow. Ow!
- What?

15:44.190 --> 15:45.590
What's wrong? What's wrong?
What-something's...

15:45.625 --> 15:47.388
- It's stabbing me in the back.
- Okay.

15:47.426 --> 15:48.544
Oh, I think I found it.

15:48.544 --> 15:49.877
You know what?
That's my hand. Let me do it.

15:49.912 --> 15:50.878
- Oh, yeah.
- Okay.

15:50.913 --> 15:52.080
Hey, I thought you guys didn't have

15:52.114 --> 15:53.781
a large-format printer.

15:53.849 --> 15:55.883
Yeah, I guess we have
a large-format printer.

15:55.918 --> 15:56.951
- Found it.
- All right.

15:57.019 --> 15:58.186
- Metal thing.
- 'Cause when I need

15:58.220 --> 16:00.054
to print out banners
for my travel agency,

16:00.089 --> 16:01.856
you said you didn't have one, so...

16:01.890 --> 16:03.858
- Who cares?
- I care.

16:03.892 --> 16:05.696
We didn't have banners,
and my business failed.

16:05.697 --> 16:06.929
No, Adam, your business failed

16:06.997 --> 16:08.898
because nobody uses
travel agencies anymore

16:08.932 --> 16:10.702
due to a little thing
called the Internet.

16:10.703 --> 16:12.636
Oh, here we go with
the Internet again, huh?

16:12.670 --> 16:13.870
Yeah, because it exists.

16:13.905 --> 16:15.138
Look, do you want to fight
about this printer,

16:15.173 --> 16:16.139
or do you want to have sex?

16:16.174 --> 16:17.541
I mean, I want... yeah, sex.

16:17.575 --> 16:19.343
- Okay, so shut up.
- Okay, yeah.

16:23.181 --> 16:26.383
This next song is very
near and dear to my heart

16:26.417 --> 16:28.885
because it reminds me of my father.

16:33.858 --> 16:35.455
You should be ashamed of yourself.

16:35.455 --> 16:38.657
You started it. I'm just finishing it.

16:38.691 --> 16:40.359
Oh, I don't know about that.

16:40.393 --> 16:43.362
All it's gonna take
is for this tower to fall over

16:43.396 --> 16:44.897
and my guy's walking out the door.

16:44.964 --> 16:46.231
Looks pretty steady to me.

16:46.299 --> 16:48.534
No, no, that thing is way too narrow.

16:48.568 --> 16:49.594
Come on, baby.

16:50.469 --> 16:52.470
Come on, baby, come on, come on.

16:52.504 --> 16:54.439
Give it to Daddy. Give it to Daddy.

16:54.473 --> 16:57.809
Give Daddy what he wants!
Give it to Daddy!

16:57.843 --> 16:59.177
Give Daddy that sugar.

17:00.713 --> 17:03.381
Yeah! Yes!

17:03.449 --> 17:07.115
Oh, [Bleep] you,
you [Bleep] [Bleep]hole.

17:07.853 --> 17:08.819
Come on, baby.

17:08.854 --> 17:10.424
I quit, all right?

17:10.425 --> 17:12.193
- Yes! Yes.
- I quit.

17:12.227 --> 17:13.928
Come on, baby, yeah!

17:13.962 --> 17:16.097
Told you, I get carried
away when I gamble.

17:16.131 --> 17:17.464
You should have seen me last time.

17:17.531 --> 17:19.233
What happened last time?

17:19.267 --> 17:21.769
It was nothing, just a little
online poker thing in college.

17:21.803 --> 17:23.537
I had to sell my brother's Camry.

17:23.571 --> 17:25.539
- It's not a big deal.
- Wait, what?

17:28.627 --> 17:30.143
Keep smiling!

17:35.785 --> 17:38.053
Is that opera?

17:38.087 --> 17:39.988
- No.
- No?

17:40.056 --> 17:42.624
- You all right, Glenn?
- Mm? Oh.

17:42.658 --> 17:45.059
One of the temporary workers quit.

17:45.093 --> 17:47.829
- Oh, oh, that's a shame.
- Mm.

17:47.896 --> 17:50.528
But, you know, it happens
all the time, right?

17:50.529 --> 17:52.667
- These guys quit early.
- Yeah, I know. It's...

17:52.734 --> 17:54.302
I'm just disappointed

17:55.560 --> 17:58.866
'cause I hired them from my
church's Last Chances program.

17:59.741 --> 18:01.943
- But I guess, you know...
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

18:01.977 --> 18:03.578
- Last Chances?
- Yeah, yeah.

18:03.612 --> 18:05.980
You know, they're sort of
former drug addicts

18:06.014 --> 18:08.316
or kids with criminal records

18:08.350 --> 18:10.541
who can't find work anywhere else.

18:11.954 --> 18:13.287
So...

18:13.322 --> 18:16.257
Come on, Santa Three.
Jesus gave you knees.

18:16.291 --> 18:17.959
Pick them up.

18:17.993 --> 18:20.161
These poor souls are
just looking for a break

18:20.195 --> 18:21.829
and you turned this into Thunderdome.

18:21.864 --> 18:23.197
Yeah, I feel terrible.

18:23.265 --> 18:25.666
I didn't realize they were Last Chances.

18:25.701 --> 18:28.603
I did. I thought that was why
we were betting on them.

18:28.637 --> 18:31.873
Whoo! Is it hot in here today?

18:31.940 --> 18:33.274
Do I look flushed to you?

18:33.308 --> 18:35.643
What do you mean by flushed?
Do you mean tired?

18:35.677 --> 18:36.604
Because you always look tired.

18:36.605 --> 18:38.426
Oh, my back hurts.

18:38.427 --> 18:42.776
That table in the photo lab
is really uncomfortable.

18:42.810 --> 18:44.378
The photo lab?

18:44.412 --> 18:45.646
Oops.

18:45.713 --> 18:46.980
Busted!

18:48.983 --> 18:51.652
No, me and Adam...

18:56.591 --> 18:57.824
Oh.

18:58.283 --> 18:59.383
Se... sex.

18:59.384 --> 19:00.884
- Yeah, no, we got it.
- Yeah, yeah, mm-hmm.

19:00.919 --> 19:01.986
- For sure.
- Yeah, yeah.

19:02.053 --> 19:03.387
Yeah, no, loud and clear.

19:05.877 --> 19:07.812
After careful consideration,

19:07.879 --> 19:10.614
I've decided to go with
the applicant I pretty much

19:10.649 --> 19:12.750
knew I was gonna go with
from the beginning.

19:12.784 --> 19:15.619
Uh, Santa number one. Congratulations.

19:15.654 --> 19:17.488
Ho, ho, ho.

19:17.556 --> 19:18.823
- Thank you so much.
- Well...

19:18.890 --> 19:22.226
Oh, uh, what did you say this pays?

19:22.260 --> 19:24.261
- Pays?
- Yeah, how much is the pay?

19:24.296 --> 19:27.231
Well, no... no, you get to be Santa.

19:27.265 --> 19:28.499
I get to be.

19:28.567 --> 19:29.500
Yeah, it... it pays

19:29.568 --> 19:31.235
in a thousand smiles.

19:31.269 --> 19:33.003
It pays in the wonder

19:33.071 --> 19:36.073
on a little kid's face.

19:36.107 --> 19:37.808
What...

19:42.080 --> 19:43.781
Well, I guess it's you.

19:43.815 --> 19:45.249
Congratulations, Cody.

19:45.283 --> 19:46.851
You're Santa Claus.

19:46.918 --> 19:49.587
I'm gonna be the best [Bleep] Santa.

19:49.621 --> 19:51.188
O-okay.

19:59.364 --> 20:01.532
- Hey!
- Hey. Hi.

20:01.600 --> 20:03.767
- Hey.
- Hi.

20:03.802 --> 20:06.203
We have a good marriage, right?

20:06.271 --> 20:07.838
Uh, yeah.

20:07.873 --> 20:09.707
We just did it at work,

20:09.774 --> 20:11.942
so yeah.

20:11.977 --> 20:15.279
Yeah. I think so too.

20:18.149 --> 20:21.051
Hey! Isaac. Hey, hey.

20:21.119 --> 20:23.721
Oh, good, I was hoping
I was gonna catch you.

20:23.788 --> 20:25.122
Yeah, well I can't go home till 7:00,

20:25.156 --> 20:28.225
or my mom will know I quit another job.

20:28.293 --> 20:29.994
I wanted to give you this.

20:34.633 --> 20:37.234
- Really? I-I can't...
- No, please.

20:37.302 --> 20:39.303
It... it belongs in your hands

20:39.337 --> 20:40.591
way more than mine.

20:41.640 --> 20:42.973
Thank you.

20:43.008 --> 20:45.009
Merry Christmas.

20:47.012 --> 20:48.412
You too.

20:50.715 --> 20:51.916
Hey, it's me.

20:51.983 --> 20:56.020
How much crystal can I buy for $200?

20:56.054 --> 20:58.722
Great, I'll see you in
an hour, Uncle Kevin.

21:00.725 --> 21:02.226
Gonna get so [Bleep] high.

21:41.032 --> 21:42.833
I hate Black Friday.

21:49.442 --> 21:50.808
Here we go.

21:50.810 --> 21:55.212
This is the Super Bowl of retail.

21:55.214 --> 21:57.247
There's a buzz in the air,

21:57.249 --> 22:00.918
a charge that probably
doesn't read on camera.

22:00.920 --> 22:04.722
Uh, but over here we have
the pre-opening potluck.

22:04.724 --> 22:07.257
Every employee brings a dish,

22:07.259 --> 22:09.393
much in the spirit of sharing.

22:09.395 --> 22:11.195
Isn't that a delightful tradition, Amy?

22:11.197 --> 22:12.763
Yeah, I love waking up at 3:00 a.m.
