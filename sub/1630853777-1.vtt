01:09.570 --> 01:11.572
Marsh is not swamp.

01:13.574 --> 01:15.660
Marsh is a space of light...

01:18.621 --> 01:20.122
Where grass grows in water...

01:21.749 --> 01:23.793
And water flows into the sky.

02:08.044 --> 02:10.715
Then within the marsh, here and there...

02:13.092 --> 02:14.302
True swamp.

02:54.550 --> 02:56.469
A swamp knows all about death...

02:57.845 --> 03:00.348
And doesn't necessarily
define it as tragedy.

03:01.390 --> 03:02.808
Certainly not a sin.

03:05.478 --> 03:08.147
I thought chase Andrews
would have more common sense.

03:08.939 --> 03:11.067
Best quarterback this town ever had.

03:14.737 --> 03:17.490
Boys, are these your footprints here?

03:17.573 --> 03:18.574
Yes, sir.

03:25.706 --> 03:27.124
Where's his footprints?

03:34.757 --> 03:37.968
Yeah, some kids
just get crazy ideas in their heads

03:38.052 --> 03:40.805
and drink and think they're invincible.

03:41.389 --> 03:43.766
That chase Andrews was no kid.

03:56.612 --> 03:58.864
Hey. Look at this.

04:08.374 --> 04:11.669
- He open the grate himself?
- Could've been an accident, all the same.

04:12.169 --> 04:15.506
Time of death,
between midnight and 2 am.

04:15.589 --> 04:19.510
Cause of death,
sudden impact from the 63-foot drop.

04:20.094 --> 04:23.681
Since you found that blood
and hair on the support beam,

04:24.265 --> 04:27.601
I would deduce that was
the cause of the primary injury.

04:28.269 --> 04:32.648
Laymen's terms, he banged
the back of his head on the way down.

04:32.731 --> 04:34.525
To hit the back of his head on the beam,

04:34.608 --> 04:36.861
he would've needed
to fall backwards, is that right?

04:36.944 --> 04:40.072
- I'd say yes.
- 80 he might have been pushed.

04:40.156 --> 04:42.908
There's no fingerprints on the railing,
the grates, nothing.

04:42.992 --> 04:46.036
No fingerprints? Not from chase either?

04:47.621 --> 04:49.790
No fingerprints, no tracks.

04:49.874 --> 04:54.086
We do have those red fibers
found on the jacket.

04:54.670 --> 04:57.548
I just got the lab report
back from Atlanta.

04:58.048 --> 05:01.385
They did not come
from any of his other clothing.

05:01.469 --> 05:05.931
Wool, it says.
That could be a sweater, scarf.

05:06.015 --> 05:07.641
Hell, it could be anything.

05:07.725 --> 05:09.185
And we gotta find it.

05:09.268 --> 05:13.272
A beautiful wife, good family. Can't think
of anyone who'd want to kill chase.

05:13.355 --> 05:15.149
Come on. You know how chase was.

05:15.232 --> 05:17.902
Tomcattin', ruttin' around
like a penned-up bull let out.

05:17.985 --> 05:19.695
Don't speak ill of the dead, frank.

05:19.778 --> 05:22.948
I'm just saying
I could think of a few guys up to it.

05:23.032 --> 05:24.909
- Mr. Milton.
- Hi, Sandy.

05:24.992 --> 05:27.119
- The usual? Brunswick stew?
- How'd you guess.

05:28.454 --> 05:31.040
What do you make
of the chase Andrews case, Tom?

05:31.123 --> 05:34.084
Oh, I'm retired.
That's none of my business anymore.

05:34.168 --> 05:36.795
- Fair enough.
- Could've been that woman in the marsh.

05:36.879 --> 05:40.174
She's crazy enough for the loony bin.
I bet she'd be up to something like this.

05:40.257 --> 05:42.843
My brother's told me
that marsh girl's the missing link.

05:42.927 --> 05:45.846
You know poor chase Andrews had
something going on down in that marsh.

05:45.930 --> 05:49.308
Chase Andrews and the marsh girl?
Now if that ain't asking for trouble.

05:52.102 --> 05:54.021
What do you think
really happened, frank?

05:54.104 --> 05:55.940
You think that marsh girl killed chase?

05:56.023 --> 05:58.442
Hell, I don't know.
Truth will come out.

06:22.466 --> 06:25.844
Look at all these feathers and whatnot.

06:27.638 --> 06:30.808
She a scientist or a witch?

06:33.894 --> 06:35.271
Miss Clark?

06:39.108 --> 06:41.110
- Sheriff's department.
- Sheriff.

06:44.446 --> 06:45.948
Could get a warrant.

06:46.657 --> 06:49.118
Plain view. Probable cause, sheriff.

06:51.662 --> 06:53.581
Bet that door isn't even locked.

07:44.298 --> 07:45.382
There she is.

07:47.051 --> 07:50.471
This is the sheriff's department.
Shut down your engine.

07:58.771 --> 08:01.607
Go straight, go straight. Follow her in!

08:40.895 --> 08:43.249
- You're guilty!
- You killed chase Andrews!

08:43.273 --> 08:45.609
- You'll pay for this!
- Rot in jail!

09:03.085 --> 09:06.338
Sunday justice.
Where you gone, kitty?

09:07.464 --> 09:09.007
Please stay.

09:09.091 --> 09:10.634
Here, kitty, kitty.

09:27.609 --> 09:28.861
Miss Clark?

09:30.696 --> 09:32.573
I'm Tom Milton.

09:32.656 --> 09:36.118
I'm a lawyer. May I come in?

09:41.248 --> 09:42.750
Thank you, Mr. Frazier.

09:42.833 --> 09:48.046
You probably know that you're being held
for the murder of chase Andrews.

09:48.130 --> 09:52.509
And I have taken the Liberty of putting
myself foward to defend you.

09:52.593 --> 09:54.970
I know you've never been
in trouble before,

09:55.053 --> 10:00.392
so I can explain the courtroom
and the trial and who is who and whatnot.

10:03.812 --> 10:07.316
Uh, do you have family
that you might want to come be with you?

10:14.948 --> 10:19.661
Miss Clark, I don't quite know
how to put this, but, uh...

10:21.330 --> 10:25.709
Well, I know you
as Catherine Danielle Clark,

10:25.793 --> 10:29.588
but here in barkley cove
they don't call you by that name.

10:29.671 --> 10:31.298
They call you marsh girl.

10:32.424 --> 10:35.260
And when you stand trial,

10:35.344 --> 10:38.013
you will be judged by a jury of your peers

10:38.096 --> 10:41.183
from barkley cove,
who only know you as such.

10:41.266 --> 10:45.395
They are going to judge you
whether they know you or not.

10:47.231 --> 10:52.694
But I can't help you unless I know you.

10:52.778 --> 10:54.988
Even just a little bit.

10:59.034 --> 11:00.619
Well, all right, then. Um...

11:02.079 --> 11:06.083
I'll come back in a while
when you've had time to consider.

11:08.293 --> 11:12.589
Oh, and I brought you this
just in the meantime.

11:20.013 --> 11:21.348
Mr. Frazier.

11:25.686 --> 11:29.189
People forget about the creatures
who live in shells.

11:32.568 --> 11:34.027
I had a family once.

11:36.488 --> 11:38.031
They called me kya.

11:44.788 --> 11:45.831
Kya!

11:45.914 --> 11:48.876
Kya! You'd better not get too far out.

11:50.669 --> 11:51.669
Get it, get it!

12:08.687 --> 12:12.232
Now this little piggy went
to market. Now you hold still.

12:14.026 --> 12:15.861
This little piggy stayed home.

12:16.653 --> 12:18.989
This little piggy ate roast beef.

12:19.656 --> 12:22.034
This little piggy had none.

12:22.117 --> 12:28.165
And this little piggy went
wee-wee-wee-wee all the way home.

12:32.085 --> 12:34.004
That's my special girl.

12:38.425 --> 12:39.635
Hey, Jodie!

12:41.553 --> 12:42.971
Hey, Tate!

12:43.055 --> 12:45.098
Wanna come fishing?

12:46.516 --> 12:49.770
- I ain't got too much time.
- "Ain't" isn't a real word.

12:51.813 --> 12:55.692
Hey, how many times I told you
not to mess in my goddamn boat?!

12:57.653 --> 12:59.821
Get in the house! Are you stupid?!

13:02.574 --> 13:05.327
Come here! Now you've done it.

13:06.495 --> 13:08.705
You gotta learn respect. You hear me?

13:10.248 --> 13:13.001
- Stop it! You're hurting her!
- Hey, you leave my pa alone!

13:13.085 --> 13:15.337
Come back on my land,
I'll shoot you! You hear me?!

13:15.420 --> 13:17.547
- Calm down now.
- Shut up!

13:19.216 --> 13:20.216
Shut up!

13:24.096 --> 13:25.740
- Leave me alone!
- I'll show you!

13:25.764 --> 13:27.140
Please just stop!

14:20.944 --> 14:22.112
Ma never came back.

14:24.364 --> 14:26.992
And everybody else was quick
to get out the same way.

14:27.868 --> 14:29.745
Murph was the first to leave.

14:31.538 --> 14:34.499
A few months later, Mandy and missy.

14:37.711 --> 14:40.505
Then, finally, Jodie.

14:43.884 --> 14:44.885
Kya, listen.

14:45.927 --> 14:49.264
I have to go, kya.
I can't live here no longer.

14:52.100 --> 14:54.561
Kya, you be careful, hear?

14:54.644 --> 14:55.854
If you're in trouble,

14:55.937 --> 14:59.357
run and hide deep in the marsh
way out where the crawdads sing.

15:01.151 --> 15:02.569
Like ma always says.

15:21.588 --> 15:22.714
Run!

15:24.341 --> 15:25.342
Jodie!

15:26.802 --> 15:29.805
I learned from the mistakes
of the others how to live with him.

15:33.016 --> 15:35.227
Just keep out of the way.

15:35.310 --> 15:36.686
Don't let him see you.

15:37.646 --> 15:38.939
Fend for yourself.

16:31.366 --> 16:35.620
I had been out in the marsh plenty
of times with Jodie, but never alone.

16:37.247 --> 16:38.790
I didn't know which way was home.

16:39.499 --> 16:42.127
Damn you for leaving me here, Jodie!

16:44.546 --> 16:45.547
Damn you.

16:55.891 --> 16:57.350
You okay?

17:00.103 --> 17:01.730
You're Jodie Clark's sister.

17:02.439 --> 17:04.523
Used to be. He's gone.

17:07.777 --> 17:09.945
- You know your way home?
- Yeah.

17:17.369 --> 17:20.040
It's okay. I get lost all the time.

17:29.799 --> 17:32.135
My name's Tate, in case you see me again.

17:35.013 --> 17:38.934
There was something about that boy
that eased the tightness in my chest.

17:40.185 --> 17:42.520
For the first time
since ma and Jodie left,

17:42.604 --> 17:44.606
I felt something other than hurt.

17:47.192 --> 17:48.693
I felt brave.

17:51.071 --> 17:52.072
I'm hungry.

18:05.877 --> 18:08.922
Morning, Mr. Clark. How you doing?

18:09.005 --> 18:13.051
Well, jumpin',
I woke up on the right side of dirt.

18:14.719 --> 18:18.390
Oh, this is my daughter, miss kya Clark.

18:18.473 --> 18:20.809
Well, I'm mighty proud
to know you, miss kya.

18:21.726 --> 18:25.021
Oh, don't mind her.
I tell her, uh, stay away from everybody.

18:25.105 --> 18:28.692
- It's a dangerous world, isn't it?
- It is. But the fishing's good.

18:28.775 --> 18:30.860
Could I get a bag of grits?

18:30.944 --> 18:33.405
And some of that Jim beam?

18:34.030 --> 18:36.449
- And maybe you fill her up for me?
- It's okay.

18:37.575 --> 18:39.244
- Mabel.
- Mm-hm.

18:43.039 --> 18:44.791
You wait for our change, you hear?

18:47.794 --> 18:50.130
Helping out your pa
while your ma's gone, huh?

18:50.880 --> 18:52.966
I ain't seen her in a while.

18:54.092 --> 18:56.928
- She's doing chores at home.
- Mm-hm.

19:00.974 --> 19:02.559
Grits ain't much to go on.

19:05.520 --> 19:07.147
All right. Let's see here.

19:07.230 --> 19:09.733
Your pa left $2 here.

19:09.816 --> 19:15.030
And the bill is $1.50.

19:15.739 --> 19:17.282
How much does that leave for gas?

19:23.872 --> 19:25.081
Don't worry about that.

19:25.165 --> 19:27.042
I got another question for you.

19:27.751 --> 19:28.918
You go to school, honey?

19:31.796 --> 19:34.591
Do you know that they publish
the school lunch menu in the paper?

19:35.342 --> 19:36.843
Today's is...

19:38.178 --> 19:39.888
Salisbury steak.

19:39.971 --> 19:43.641
You could get a nice, hot meal,
make some friends.

19:44.351 --> 19:46.603
Plenty of kids go to school without shoes.

19:47.228 --> 19:50.106
But you will need a skirt.

19:50.190 --> 19:51.274
Ask your mama for one.

19:52.609 --> 19:53.610
There you go.

19:54.277 --> 19:57.572
And the change is 50 cents.

20:42.826 --> 20:43.827
Boys!

20:43.910 --> 20:46.079
Chase Andrews,
what you got to say for yourself?

20:46.162 --> 20:47.705
Sorry, miss pansy.

20:47.789 --> 20:49.958
We didn't see you
'cause that girl got in the way.

20:52.544 --> 20:53.544
Hello there.

20:54.796 --> 20:58.216
I think you've got yourself
turned around the wrong way, little lady.

20:58.299 --> 20:59.968
Isn't school that way?

21:00.051 --> 21:01.886
- So dirty.
- Gross.

21:02.971 --> 21:05.306
You have just as much of a right
to be there.

21:05.390 --> 21:07.809
Go along now. It's all right.

21:13.815 --> 21:18.236
Miss Catherine Danielle Clark,
are you reading and writing already?

21:20.655 --> 21:22.323
Can you spell "dog," honey?

21:26.786 --> 21:28.079
Who is that?

21:28.663 --> 21:32.333
G-o-d.

21:34.502 --> 21:37.380
Well, we can all use practice, can't we?

21:37.464 --> 21:41.259
You can go ahead and sit down,
miss Catherine Danielle Clark.

21:43.845 --> 21:45.388
Where you been, marsh hen?

21:45.472 --> 21:47.515
Where's your hat, swamp rat?

21:47.599 --> 21:51.936
Now, boys and girls, settle down.
Just an hour until lunch.

21:52.020 --> 21:54.439
Please, try to pay attention
to our lesson.

21:54.522 --> 21:57.650
Who can tell me a word
that has a long vowel sound?

21:57.734 --> 22:00.945
- She probably lives in the mud.
- Someone's got cooties.

22:01.029 --> 22:03.740
That stink in the room.

22:04.741 --> 22:05.742
Excuse me.

22:08.161 --> 22:10.288
That was the only day
I ever spent in school.

22:11.539 --> 22:13.875
Reckoned I was better off learning
from the wild.

22:16.544 --> 22:18.505
Hi, Tate!

22:20.340 --> 22:21.340
Mm-mm.

22:34.687 --> 22:37.065
Need you to be careful out here.
You hear me?

22:38.191 --> 22:39.609
You can't trust nobody.

22:40.443 --> 22:41.778
You protect yourself.

22:58.086 --> 22:59.754
Great horned owl, probably.

23:01.923 --> 23:04.676
For a while, pa was good to me.

23:12.642 --> 23:17.981
Ahem. I thought you could use this
for your feathers, bird nests.

23:18.064 --> 23:19.566
Other stuff you collect.

23:22.652 --> 23:24.404
- Oh, thank you.
- Yeah.

23:31.703 --> 23:33.871
- It was my old army...
- Mail!

23:35.290 --> 23:36.874
It's my old army knapsack.

23:45.091 --> 23:47.427
It's from ma! It's from ma!

23:48.136 --> 23:50.138
It's ma's handwriting!

23:50.221 --> 23:52.473
- Ma's alive!
- Give it to me.

23:53.224 --> 23:54.309
Give it to me.

24:00.481 --> 24:02.442
- When's she coming home?
- Wait.

24:03.151 --> 24:04.235
What does she say?

24:08.573 --> 24:10.241
- No!
- Quiet.

24:10.825 --> 24:13.244
Pa! Pa, stop!

24:13.328 --> 24:15.997
Stop it! Stop that!

24:16.080 --> 24:17.749
- Stop!
- Quiet. Quiet!

24:21.544 --> 24:22.545
Now you listen to me.

24:23.463 --> 24:24.964
She ain't never coming back.

24:26.090 --> 24:27.090
You hear me?

24:34.599 --> 24:35.892
That isn't true.

24:39.395 --> 24:41.481
"Ain't" isn't even a real word!

24:52.367 --> 24:54.035
Goddamn bitch!

24:57.830 --> 24:58.830
Useless.

24:59.582 --> 25:02.043
Pa took to burning any trace of ma.

25:03.211 --> 25:05.046
Get your shit out of my house.

25:09.967 --> 25:11.135
And then one day...

25:12.470 --> 25:13.554
He was gone.

25:16.182 --> 25:18.059
Wasn't like the pain when ma left.

25:18.142 --> 25:22.855
But being completely alone
was a feeling so vast, it echoed.

25:43.626 --> 25:45.920
And there was the small matter
of surviving.

25:50.091 --> 25:52.719
I didn't know
how to do life without grits.

26:21.247 --> 26:22.874
Well, hello, miss kya.

26:27.128 --> 26:29.046
You want something?

26:29.130 --> 26:30.465
Mr. Jumpin'...

26:31.841 --> 26:33.968
I hear tell y'all buy mussels.

26:34.844 --> 26:36.304
I got some here.

26:38.431 --> 26:41.058
- They fresh?
- Dug them before dawn.

26:41.142 --> 26:42.142
Just now.

26:42.727 --> 26:44.812
Your pa sent you out with these?

26:50.485 --> 26:53.905
Look, I tell you what,
I'll give you 50 cent for the one bag

26:53.988 --> 26:55.907
and a full tank of gas for the other.

26:55.990 --> 26:57.617
How many bags y'all need a week?

26:58.159 --> 26:59.911
Are we striking up a business deal?

27:02.413 --> 27:06.000
I buy about 40 pound
every two, three days.

27:06.584 --> 27:08.127
Mind you, others bring them too.

27:08.211 --> 27:11.380
So if you bring them,
and I already got some,

27:11.464 --> 27:13.090
why, you'd just be out.

27:13.174 --> 27:16.594
It's first come, first served.
Ain't no other way of doing it.

27:16.677 --> 27:19.096
That's fine. Thank you.

27:21.516 --> 27:22.558
Can I, uh...?

27:23.810 --> 27:24.977
Oh, yeah.

27:37.240 --> 27:39.450
You sure are growing up fast, huh?

27:40.660 --> 27:43.120
Why don't you come by next week,
I'll measure your feet.

27:43.204 --> 27:46.749
I got some shoes in the church
donation bin just collecting dust.

27:47.500 --> 27:49.293
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Sure.

28:01.097 --> 28:02.181
Poor child.

28:03.516 --> 28:07.353
Her ma's gone,
and now her pa's gone too, I bet.

28:08.354 --> 28:09.438
What?

28:09.522 --> 28:12.859
We ought to be careful,
messing in folk business.

28:12.942 --> 28:14.777
It don't say that in the Bible.

28:14.861 --> 28:16.070
"Be careful."

28:17.071 --> 28:20.283
"And the king shall answer
and say unto them,

28:20.366 --> 28:24.537
verily I say unto thee,
inasmuch as ye hath done it

28:24.620 --> 28:28.583
unto the least of these,
my brethren, ye have done it unto me."

28:28.666 --> 28:29.792
All right, Mabel.

28:30.877 --> 28:32.295
Don't say about "be careful."

28:45.391 --> 28:47.310
- Let's see.
- [Kya giggles}

28:51.314 --> 28:53.065
one, two, three. That's all.

29:08.581 --> 29:10.082
They're from miss Mabel.

29:24.013 --> 29:28.142
Catherine Danielle Clark,
of barkley county, north Carolina,

29:28.225 --> 29:30.770
is charged with the murder
in the first degree

29:30.853 --> 29:33.397
of chase Lawrence Andrews,

29:33.481 --> 29:35.858
formerly of barkley cove.

29:35.942 --> 29:39.612
In such cases, the state is allowed
to seek the death penalty.

29:39.695 --> 29:41.572
The prosecution has announced
it will do so

29:41.656 --> 29:44.450
if the defendant is found guilty.

29:44.533 --> 29:47.036
Guilty! We all know she's guilty.

29:47.119 --> 29:50.206
She's guilty.

29:50.289 --> 29:52.333
We will now begin jury selection.

29:52.416 --> 29:54.585
Will our prospective jurors
in the first two rows...

29:54.669 --> 29:59.131
There is an option.
It's what's called a plea bargain.

30:00.049 --> 30:03.552
And it means
that if you are willing to say

30:03.636 --> 30:08.599
that you did go to the tower that night
and met chase Andrews there

30:09.308 --> 30:13.980
and you had a disagreement,
and in a horrible accident

30:14.063 --> 30:16.148
he stepped backwards through the grate,

30:16.232 --> 30:20.111
you'd get ten years,
but you'd be out in six.

30:20.194 --> 30:21.237
No.

30:22.029 --> 30:24.115
If we lose, we lose big.

30:24.198 --> 30:27.034
It's life in prison, or the other.

30:27.118 --> 30:30.663
Mr. Milton, I won't say anything
that implies guilt.

30:32.081 --> 30:33.874
I will not go to prison.

30:33.958 --> 30:35.209
Please call me Tom.

30:35.292 --> 30:37.586
And promise me
that you will think about this.

30:37.670 --> 30:38.796
I have to get out of here.

30:40.464 --> 30:41.465
One way...

30:42.591 --> 30:43.426
Or the other.

30:43.509 --> 30:46.971
Between midnight and 2 am.
On October 30th...

30:48.389 --> 30:54.186
The defendant lured chase Andrews
to the tower and pushed him to his death.

30:54.270 --> 30:56.564
She then covered up her tracks
and fingerprints.

30:56.647 --> 30:59.900
Now, you're gonna hear she had the time,
she had the motivation,

30:59.984 --> 31:01.652
but most importantly...

31:04.071 --> 31:08.242
She has the weakness of character
to murder chase Andrews.

31:13.914 --> 31:19.253
Ladies and gentlemen, the state is going
to throw a lot of words at you

31:19.336 --> 31:22.381
about miss Catherine Danielle Clark.

31:23.841 --> 31:26.844
But I am asking you
to look at the evidence

31:26.927 --> 31:30.473
that the state will be offering
to back up those words.

31:31.307 --> 31:33.768
You'll find that there is none.

31:33.851 --> 31:36.937
Furthermore, you are going to hear
that there's a good chance

31:37.021 --> 31:42.568
no one murdered chase Andrews
and that the defendant, miss Clark,

31:42.651 --> 31:47.907
finds herself here because it is easier
to lay blame on an outsider

31:47.990 --> 31:51.285
than it is to rely on facts.

31:51.368 --> 31:57.374
And although she was born and grew up
not five miles from this courtroom,

31:58.334 --> 32:00.211
miss Clark is an outsider.

34:01.749 --> 34:03.959
It's me. Tate.

34:26.649 --> 34:27.815
Tundra swan.

34:29.318 --> 34:32.737
- How do you know birds?
- My ma liked birds.

34:36.742 --> 34:37.952
I can't read your note.

34:42.873 --> 34:47.085
Oh, all I said was I'd seen you
a couple times when I was out fishing,

34:47.168 --> 34:51.090
and it got me thinking that maybe
you could use some seeds and a spark plug.

34:51.172 --> 34:54.717
I had extra.
Thought it might save you a trip to town.

34:55.636 --> 34:59.139
And, uh, I don't know,
I figured you'd like the feathers.

35:03.102 --> 35:04.353
All right, then.

35:09.066 --> 35:10.234
All right, then.

35:15.239 --> 35:17.199
Well, I better be going, so...

35:24.873 --> 35:26.417
I could teach you to read.

35:30.796 --> 35:33.215
I thought you may as well learn
to write at the same time.

35:33.299 --> 35:34.925
Oh, yeah.

35:35.009 --> 35:37.678
Good. Okay, so we start with a.

35:38.887 --> 35:40.889
Just go ahead
and draw that shape right there.

35:52.318 --> 35:53.319
Don't tell me.

35:54.153 --> 35:55.321
You're getting there.

35:55.404 --> 35:58.407
- Don't help me.
- Sure. I got all day.

35:58.490 --> 36:02.661
"There are some who can live

36:03.454 --> 36:07.583
without wild things, comma,

36:08.208 --> 36:10.961
and some who cannot."

36:13.797 --> 36:17.051
That's what I'm talking about, kya. Whoo!

36:17.134 --> 36:19.970
And there will never be a time again
where you can't read, ever.

36:20.054 --> 36:22.723
I didn't know words could hold so much.

36:22.806 --> 36:24.558
Not all words hold that much.

36:29.438 --> 36:31.231
We could read at my house sometime.

37:02.388 --> 37:04.264
We went through the whole library.

37:04.765 --> 37:07.601
Three times a week, summer into fall.

37:10.687 --> 37:13.065
Read how plants
and animals change over time

37:13.148 --> 37:15.067
to adjust to the ever-shifting earth.

37:18.112 --> 37:22.116
How birds sing mostly at dawn
because the cool, moist air of morning

37:22.199 --> 37:24.785
carries their songs
and their meanings much farther.

37:28.080 --> 37:32.626
How some cells divide
and specialize into lungs or hearts

37:33.502 --> 37:36.213
while others remain uncommitted
as stem cells

37:36.296 --> 37:37.798
in case they're needed later.

37:39.675 --> 37:41.802
Within all the worlds of biology...

37:43.178 --> 37:47.015
I searched for an explanation of why
a mother would leave her offspring.

37:51.770 --> 37:54.273
"Mr. Jackson Henry Clark

37:54.356 --> 37:59.987
married miss julienne Maria Jacques,
June 12, 1933."

38:01.238 --> 38:04.366
That means these are my parents.

38:05.284 --> 38:08.912
"Master Jeremy Andrew Clark, January 2."

38:08.996 --> 38:10.122
That's Jodie.

38:10.956 --> 38:16.462
"Master napier Murphy Clark,
miss Mary Helen Clark,

38:16.545 --> 38:18.964
miss Catherine Danielle Clark."

38:27.055 --> 38:28.140
I miss them.

38:31.268 --> 38:32.269
I had, um...

38:34.771 --> 38:36.273
I had forgot how much...

38:37.858 --> 38:39.401
I feel them not here.

38:45.115 --> 38:47.367
I feel them not here right now.

38:47.451 --> 38:48.577
I mean...

38:51.663 --> 38:53.749
Sometimes I feel so invisible...

38:55.459 --> 38:57.127
I wonder if I'm here at all.

38:58.462 --> 38:59.462
You are.

39:11.308 --> 39:13.602
- Sorry I'm late.
- Come on. Give me a hand.

39:15.062 --> 39:17.314
Son, you know I don't listen to idle talk.

39:18.524 --> 39:21.235
But there is a regular riptide
of gossip going around

39:21.318 --> 39:23.320
you got something going on
with that marsh girl.

39:25.113 --> 39:26.823
Hey, you know you can tell me anything.

39:27.658 --> 39:29.618
- She your girlfriend?
- She's my friend.

39:29.701 --> 39:32.871
I bring her books 'cause people are
so nasty to her, she can't go to school.

39:34.039 --> 39:35.290
She doesn't have any family.

39:37.084 --> 39:41.213
Hey. Come on. There's no need to be huffy.

39:42.256 --> 39:45.175
It's my job to say all the things
that we don't like to talk about,

39:45.259 --> 39:48.762
and I can't give you a lot of things
those other dads can give their sons.

39:48.845 --> 39:50.055
So I'm asking you.

39:50.973 --> 39:52.057
Just be careful.

39:53.058 --> 39:56.436
Everything you've worked so hard for,
your dreams of going to chapel hill...

39:57.312 --> 39:58.981
Life can change in a second.

40:01.525 --> 40:02.943
You understand that?

40:04.403 --> 40:07.948
Now turn up my music, would you? Come on.

40:11.201 --> 40:13.287
It's puccini, in case you're wondering.

40:33.307 --> 40:37.811
A young girl living on her own
like that looks immoral, don't you think?

40:37.894 --> 40:40.814
No, sir. I don't. Think, that is.

40:40.897 --> 40:43.525
At least not enough. Just ask my wife.

40:45.569 --> 40:49.448
There are some fine group homes
that would help keep a young woman

40:49.531 --> 40:50.532
out of trouble.

40:52.534 --> 40:54.786
They say she comes in here
from time to time.

40:54.870 --> 40:57.414
I do see her from time to time.

40:58.081 --> 41:00.500
She's not alone.
She's got her father with her.

41:00.584 --> 41:03.587
Well, I've never seen anybody home
all the times I've been by.

41:04.504 --> 41:06.423
When does she usually come around?

41:06.506 --> 41:09.134
I never know
just when she'll boat in here.

41:09.760 --> 41:12.471
Have her call me next time she comes in.

41:15.932 --> 41:19.019
You don't have any reason
to lie to me, do you, boy?

41:19.102 --> 41:20.979
No reason at all, sir.

41:37.621 --> 41:40.749
- We gotta meet somewhere else.
- Hi, kya. Good to see you too.

41:40.832 --> 41:42.626
Social services are looking for me again.

41:42.709 --> 41:44.920
They're gonna pull me in,
put me in some group home.

41:45.003 --> 41:47.005
It's polite to greet people
when you see them.

41:53.428 --> 41:56.765
You know, a group home
might not be the worst thing.

41:57.557 --> 42:00.519
What? No, no. You'd have
someone cooking you warm meals.

42:00.602 --> 42:02.688
- Real bed.
- I got a real bed.

42:03.563 --> 42:06.983
'Sides, I'd never leave the marsh
to go live with a bunch of strangers.

42:07.067 --> 42:09.569
It's "besides," not sides."

42:10.237 --> 42:12.197
And you can't live alone
in the marsh forever.

42:12.280 --> 42:13.281
Watch me.

42:14.658 --> 42:15.659
All right.

42:37.806 --> 42:40.934
I appreciate you teaching me to read

42:41.518 --> 42:43.770
and all the things you gave me.

42:44.813 --> 42:46.106
But why do you do it?

42:46.940 --> 42:49.443
Don't you have a girlfriend or something?

42:50.610 --> 42:51.778
Sometimes I do.

42:52.612 --> 42:53.612
Sometimes?

42:54.781 --> 42:57.284
I mean, I've had one.

42:58.994 --> 43:00.370
Uh, but not now...

43:01.621 --> 43:03.457
Idont, so...

43:08.253 --> 43:09.880
Uh, ahnght

43:09.963 --> 43:10.964
I, uh...

43:12.549 --> 43:15.135
I saw you on your pa's boat the other day.

43:17.345 --> 43:18.597
He seems real nice, your dad.

43:18.680 --> 43:20.515
Yeah. Yeah, he is.

43:21.224 --> 43:23.393
You never talk about your ma.

43:25.645 --> 43:26.730
What's she like?

43:32.611 --> 43:35.405
Uh, you don't have to say nothing.

43:36.656 --> 43:40.702
My mother and little sister died
in a car wreck over in asheville.

43:44.206 --> 43:46.416
My little sister's name was carianne.

43:49.544 --> 43:50.796
It was, uh...

43:56.301 --> 43:57.469
What, Tate?

43:58.970 --> 44:00.597
You can say anything to me.

44:06.603 --> 44:09.689
I think they went to asheville
to buy me my birthday present.

44:11.483 --> 44:14.027
There was this bike I wanted,

44:14.611 --> 44:16.738
and western auto didn't carry it...

44:19.115 --> 44:21.868
So I think they went into asheville
to get that bike for me.

44:22.911 --> 44:23.912
Oh.

44:24.746 --> 44:27.165
And I don't even remember
what kind of bike it was.

44:31.503 --> 44:32.963
It wasn't your fault.

44:44.599 --> 44:45.599
Oh!

44:48.395 --> 44:49.896
Oh, my gosh!

45:13.253 --> 45:14.754
Am I your girlfriend now?

45:14.838 --> 45:16.006
Do you wanna be?

45:17.299 --> 45:18.341
I know feathers.

45:20.176 --> 45:22.345
Bet the other girls don't know feathers.

45:24.389 --> 45:25.390
All right, then.

45:26.766 --> 45:27.767
All right, then.

46:40.507 --> 46:43.218
- I've never been out this way.
- It's worth the trip.

46:43.760 --> 46:44.760
You'll see.

46:46.096 --> 46:47.097
Happy birthday, kya.

46:50.517 --> 46:51.977
How'd you know it was my birthday?

46:52.060 --> 46:53.645
Oh, I read it in your Bible.

46:56.314 --> 46:58.066
Did you know it was your birthday?

46:59.359 --> 47:00.694
Don't have a calendar.

47:04.447 --> 47:06.408
Oh, um, not my name.

47:06.491 --> 47:07.575
Don't cut my name.

47:07.659 --> 47:08.785
Yes, ma'am.

47:20.839 --> 47:22.507
- Mm!
- Pretty good, huh?

47:25.135 --> 47:26.219
What's that?

47:27.387 --> 47:28.680
Here they come.

47:38.565 --> 47:39.566
Oh, wow.

47:40.984 --> 47:42.318
Snow geese.

48:17.103 --> 48:18.104
Kya, look at me.

49:09.197 --> 49:11.324
Kya, I'm sorry.

49:12.033 --> 49:13.034
I'm sorry.

49:14.702 --> 49:15.703
Jeez.

49:18.373 --> 49:20.500
No, Tate, I want to.

49:21.918 --> 49:22.918
Why not?

49:24.295 --> 49:25.295
Because I...

49:27.298 --> 49:28.967
I care about you too much.

49:29.884 --> 49:35.765
Look, kya. I want you more than anything,
but I can't be damaged as easily.

49:35.849 --> 49:38.434
It's more dangerous for you.
You understand?

49:51.781 --> 49:53.658
Fall gave way to winter.

49:54.409 --> 49:55.869
Winter to spring.

49:57.412 --> 50:00.248
The only constant in nature is change.

50:00.331 --> 50:01.499
Dad, I got in!

50:24.189 --> 50:25.356
Why are you quiet?

50:27.400 --> 50:29.110
You know I'm going away soon.

50:30.028 --> 50:31.029
To college.

50:33.406 --> 50:34.616
You talked about it.

50:36.743 --> 50:37.743
When?

50:38.870 --> 50:40.288
Not right away.

50:43.124 --> 50:44.125
Soon.

50:45.418 --> 50:47.253
I got a job at the biology lab.

50:48.213 --> 50:49.714
Starts next week, so...

51:01.643 --> 51:02.644
Stay here.

51:03.561 --> 51:04.771
And do what?

51:08.399 --> 51:10.735
No, look. I just mean
there's no work for me here.

51:10.818 --> 51:13.613
What am I gonna do?
I don't want to be a shrimper like my dad.

51:14.280 --> 51:16.282
I'm going to get a degree
and be something, kya.

51:16.366 --> 51:18.701
- So could you.
- What do you want me to be?

51:20.203 --> 51:22.705
- That's not what I meant.
- You're never gonna come back.

51:22.789 --> 51:25.833
Yes, I will. I won't leave you, kya.
I promise.

51:25.917 --> 51:27.252
I'm gonna come back to you.

51:28.294 --> 51:30.964
Kya! Kya, stop! Ky—-

51:32.131 --> 51:34.550
you can't run away from every whipstitch!

51:55.363 --> 51:57.907
- One more night.
- One more night.

52:23.099 --> 52:24.100
What's this?

52:26.311 --> 52:28.604
It's a list of publishers.

52:29.605 --> 52:31.149
For all your drawings and notes.

52:31.232 --> 52:33.443
There's nothing like them out there, kya.

52:33.860 --> 52:35.653
There's enough for a book.

52:35.737 --> 52:37.113
Lots of books.

52:38.823 --> 52:40.992
And, you know,
you wouldn't have to leave home.

52:41.701 --> 52:44.162
You could just mail your samples
into a publisher.

52:44.871 --> 52:46.414
You know, bring some money in.

52:47.832 --> 52:50.168
You know, probably not a huge amount...

52:51.169 --> 52:54.380
But maybe you wouldn't have
to dig mussels the rest of your life.

52:56.007 --> 52:57.258
Just give it a try, kya.

52:59.469 --> 53:00.803
Come on. What can it hurt?

53:04.640 --> 53:06.392
You're gonna forget about me.

53:08.811 --> 53:10.938
When you get busy
with all that college stuff,

53:11.522 --> 53:12.815
all those pretty girls.

53:12.899 --> 53:14.692
I could never forget you, kya.

53:15.568 --> 53:16.568
Even

53:18.988 --> 53:22.784
I'll be home in a month. I promise.
For the fourth of July. Okay?

53:24.702 --> 53:26.120
I'll be back before you know it.

53:26.704 --> 53:29.499
We'll meet on your beach
and watch fireworks together.

53:30.041 --> 53:32.168
Just write those publishers, all right?

53:53.731 --> 53:54.732
Good bye, kya.

53:55.858 --> 53:56.943
Goodbye, Tate.

54:25.304 --> 54:27.473
Seabirds of the eastern seaboard.

54:28.766 --> 54:30.184
Starring you, big red.

56:31.722 --> 56:32.723
No.

56:40.106 --> 56:41.148
No, Tate.

56:44.986 --> 56:46.028
No, no.

56:55.413 --> 56:58.082
No, no, no.

57:12.597 --> 57:15.891
Tate and life
and love had been the same thing.

57:17.226 --> 57:18.436
They were all gone.

57:22.064 --> 57:23.065
And then...

57:45.713 --> 57:49.634
Whenever I stumbled, the marsh caught me.

57:57.183 --> 57:58.851
At some unclaimed moment,

57:58.934 --> 58:01.395
at last, the heart pain seeped away,

58:01.479 --> 58:03.439
like water into sand.

58:03.522 --> 58:05.274
Still there, but deep.

58:07.526 --> 58:11.155
There were no footprints
around the body or on the fire tower.

58:11.238 --> 58:13.032
And no fresh fingerprints either.

58:13.115 --> 58:15.993
Not even on the grate,
which somebody had to open.

58:16.077 --> 58:18.537
All this indicated
that someone had destroyed evidence.

58:18.621 --> 58:19.747
No more questions.

58:21.290 --> 58:22.583
Your witness.

58:29.423 --> 58:33.052
Sheriff,
I'm handing you the tide table

58:33.135 --> 58:37.890
for the night of October 29
and the morning of October 30.

58:37.973 --> 58:43.270
Now, this shows here
that low tide was around midnight.

58:43.771 --> 58:47.775
So at the time
chase Andrews arrived at the tower

58:47.858 --> 58:51.779
and walked to the steps,
he would have made tracks in the wet mud.

58:51.862 --> 58:57.118
And then as the groundwater Rose,
those tracks would have been wiped out.

58:57.201 --> 59:00.037
- Do you agree that this is possible?
- Well...

59:00.121 --> 59:03.666
And then you'd agree
that if he had any friends with him,

59:03.749 --> 59:06.711
their footprints would be
washed away as well.

59:06.794 --> 59:09.088
Under these circumstances,

59:09.171 --> 59:15.177
the absence of footprints in
and of itself does not suggest a crime.

59:15.845 --> 59:16.846
Correct?

59:19.932 --> 59:20.932
Shenfi?

59:23.477 --> 59:28.315
The absence of footprints does not,
by itself, prove there was a crime.

59:28.399 --> 59:31.444
You also testified
that there were no fingerprints

59:31.527 --> 59:35.698
found anywhere in the fire tower,
including on the open grate.

59:36.449 --> 59:41.662
So this led you to conclude
that someone must have opened the grate

59:41.746 --> 59:44.165
and wiped away
their fingerprints aftennards.

59:44.248 --> 59:45.249
Correct.

59:46.333 --> 59:50.963
Now, in fact, isn't it true
that these grates were left open

59:51.046 --> 59:53.758
so often and considered so dangerous

59:53.841 --> 59:56.469
that your office submitted
a written request

59:56.552 --> 59:58.179
to the us. Forest service

59:58.262 --> 01:00:03.517
to remedy the situation
on July 18 of last year?

01:00:06.312 --> 01:00:08.856
This is a copy of that request.

01:00:09.982 --> 01:00:12.234
Who wrote this, sheriff?

01:00:13.819 --> 01:00:14.862
I did it myself.

01:00:14.945 --> 01:00:18.657
Would you read to the court
the last sentence of this document

01:00:18.741 --> 01:00:20.910
that you sent to the forest service?

01:00:21.452 --> 01:00:23.078
Just the last sentence.

01:00:23.788 --> 01:00:26.582
"I must repeat,
these grates are very dangerous,

01:00:26.665 --> 01:00:28.375
and if action is not taken...

01:00:31.587 --> 01:00:35.216
If action is not taken,
a serious injury or death will occur."

01:00:37.510 --> 01:00:39.053
Thank you, sheriff.

01:01:26.183 --> 01:01:28.769
Somebody's been taking pictures
round my house.

01:01:28.853 --> 01:01:30.521
What do you think they want?

01:01:31.272 --> 01:01:32.273
Developers.

01:01:33.482 --> 01:01:36.277
They've been all up and down
the marsh last few weeks,

01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:39.196
wanting to drain the "murky swamp."
Build hotels.

01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:40.656
Yeah, I saw them last year.

01:01:41.365 --> 01:01:44.201
Cutting oak and digging channels
down the way.

01:01:44.952 --> 01:01:45.953
They want my house?

01:01:46.036 --> 01:01:47.496
Maybe not the house,

01:01:47.580 --> 01:01:49.740
but I bet they offer you
a heap of money for that land.

01:01:49.790 --> 01:01:50.791
Jumpin'!

01:01:50.875 --> 01:01:53.294
There ain't nothing wrong
with some money going to kya.

01:01:56.005 --> 01:01:59.133
You do own that land, don't you?
You own that house?

01:02:02.177 --> 01:02:03.470
Pa said so.

01:02:03.554 --> 01:02:05.472
Well, you're gonna need some proof.

01:02:05.556 --> 01:02:07.725
A deed, title.

01:02:12.438 --> 01:02:13.439
Hey.

01:02:13.522 --> 01:02:16.191
Sorry to startle you.
Can I carry that for ya?

01:02:16.984 --> 01:02:19.945
- I got it.
- Please. Let me get it.

01:02:21.405 --> 01:02:22.990
Oh, I'm chase Andrews.

01:02:24.366 --> 01:02:25.826
Your name's kya, right?

01:02:27.494 --> 01:02:31.373
Yeah. Yeah. It's a nice name.
I like it. It's different but nice.

01:02:34.209 --> 01:02:35.336
This is yours right here.

01:02:37.338 --> 01:02:38.464
There we go.

01:02:41.258 --> 01:02:44.094
You wanna go for a picnic
in my boat this Sunday?

01:02:50.184 --> 01:02:51.310
Okay.

01:02:51.393 --> 01:02:53.979
I'll pick you up at noon
from point beach. Does that work?

01:02:55.189 --> 01:02:57.191
All right. Well, I'll see ya, kya.

01:03:08.869 --> 01:03:09.995
Well, here we are.

01:03:10.079 --> 01:03:14.291
Mr. Napier Clark, looks like,
bought it in 1897.

01:03:14.875 --> 01:03:17.169
Yeah, uh, that's my grandpa.

01:03:18.003 --> 01:03:19.088
Yes, ma'am.

01:03:19.797 --> 01:03:24.802
It's never been sold, so, yes sirree,
I reckon it belongs to you.

01:03:25.427 --> 01:03:29.098
Looks like you gotta pay some back taxes
if you wanna keep it, miss Clark.

01:03:29.682 --> 01:03:32.017
In fact, ma'am, the way the law reads, uh,

01:03:32.101 --> 01:03:35.729
whoever comes along and pays
those back taxes owns the land,

01:03:35.813 --> 01:03:37.523
even if they don't got no deed.

01:03:38.482 --> 01:03:39.608
Well, how much?

01:03:39.692 --> 01:03:41.485
Looks like about...

01:03:46.031 --> 01:03:47.741
Eight hundred dollars total.

01:04:05.259 --> 01:04:06.760
Five years.

01:04:08.053 --> 01:04:11.306
It had been five years
since Tate showed me this path.

01:04:12.141 --> 01:04:13.684
Dear sir or madam,

01:04:14.768 --> 01:04:19.648
I am sending you the following pages
on the shells of the Carolina marsh

01:04:20.107 --> 01:04:21.608
for your consideration.

01:04:24.486 --> 01:04:27.364
Five years for my heart
to open its shell again.

01:04:39.001 --> 01:04:41.336
How's it feel to bask
in the presence of musical genius?

01:04:48.510 --> 01:04:49.636
Hey, look.

01:04:52.306 --> 01:04:55.350
Oh. Oh! That's an ornate scallop.

01:04:56.226 --> 01:04:57.478
Pecten ornatus.

01:04:57.561 --> 01:04:58.729
All right.

01:05:00.105 --> 01:05:03.233
- Well, it's unusual to find one here.
- Really?

01:05:04.026 --> 01:05:07.321
Yeah. This particular species usually
inhabits regions south of here

01:05:07.404 --> 01:05:10.032
'cause these waters are too cool for them.

01:05:12.409 --> 01:05:13.409
What?

01:05:14.078 --> 01:05:18.248
Oh, no, it's just, the marsh girl knows
the Latin name for shells

01:05:18.874 --> 01:05:21.502
and where they inhabit and why,
for Christ sakes.

01:05:23.045 --> 01:05:24.129
Here. You keep it.

01:05:27.132 --> 01:05:28.133
Thank you.

01:05:33.263 --> 01:05:34.765
You're something else, ain't ya?

01:05:59.289 --> 01:06:01.834
I know you think I'm trash,
but I'm worth more than a picnic.

01:06:01.917 --> 01:06:03.210
Oh, no, kya. Come on.

01:06:03.293 --> 01:06:06.255
I'm sorry. No. Hey, come on.
I've never thought you were trash.

01:06:07.422 --> 01:06:08.507
Please. I'm sorry.

01:06:08.590 --> 01:06:11.510
I understand if you wanna go,
but you can't walk from here.

01:06:11.593 --> 01:06:12.593
It's too far.

01:06:13.262 --> 01:06:14.680
Can I make it up to you?

01:06:17.266 --> 01:06:19.268
Please, can I make it up to you?

01:06:21.937 --> 01:06:24.148
I can't believe
you never been up the fire tower.

01:06:24.231 --> 01:06:27.484
Come here when my family's
all in my business. You know?

01:06:29.027 --> 01:06:31.530
It's a great way to see
the whole marsh from above.

01:06:36.994 --> 01:06:37.994
Here.

01:07:03.437 --> 01:07:04.479
What is it?

01:07:06.273 --> 01:07:08.525
You can tell me. I won't laugh at you.

01:07:09.818 --> 01:07:14.698
It's like having a friend your whole life,
but you never saw their full face.

01:07:17.242 --> 01:07:18.243
Now I see it.

01:07:24.374 --> 01:07:26.335
Your house is over there, ain't it?

01:07:30.589 --> 01:07:31.632
Take me there.

01:07:32.382 --> 01:07:33.383
Oh, um...

01:07:34.551 --> 01:07:36.929
- It's far.
- Hey, I like far.

01:07:38.639 --> 01:07:41.433
I don't care what it's like,
if that's what you're worried about.

01:07:48.106 --> 01:07:49.483
Is this it right here?

01:07:52.527 --> 01:07:54.696
How long you lived out here by yourself?

01:07:54.780 --> 01:07:56.490
Uh, about ten years, I think.

01:07:59.201 --> 01:08:01.745
Living out here with no parents
telling you what to do?

01:08:04.456 --> 01:08:06.750
There's really nothing to see inside.

01:08:09.878 --> 01:08:11.922
- Wow, what you got on the porch?
- What?

01:08:12.506 --> 01:08:14.341
Oh, um, nothing.

01:08:25.269 --> 01:08:26.645
What is all this?

01:08:27.813 --> 01:08:28.854
Nothing.

01:08:35.404 --> 01:08:37.948
What, you writing a book or something?

01:08:39.366 --> 01:08:40.367
Sort of.

01:08:41.493 --> 01:08:44.037
These look straight out
of an encyclopedia.

01:08:47.165 --> 01:08:48.792
You're the real deal, ain't ya?

01:08:52.421 --> 01:08:53.462
Ah, swanee.

01:08:54.131 --> 01:08:55.881
You got a water pump.

01:08:57.801 --> 01:08:59.219
I wasn't ready for guests.

01:08:59.303 --> 01:09:00.511
Hey, don't worry.

01:09:04.015 --> 01:09:07.060
Hey, there's nobody I know
who could live out here alone like this.

01:09:07.935 --> 01:09:10.229
I mean, most guys would be too scared.

01:09:13.692 --> 01:09:14.776
What do you want with me?

01:09:19.823 --> 01:09:23.243
Okay. Look, I'm real sorry
I came on like that.

01:09:23.327 --> 01:09:25.996
I wanna get to know you better. All right?

01:09:26.078 --> 01:09:27.581
I think you're gorgeous.

01:09:28.999 --> 01:09:33.045
I do. I think you're free as a dang Gale
and smart as a whip.

01:09:34.962 --> 01:09:37.256
But I won't do anything
unless you want me to.

01:09:38.591 --> 01:09:39.591
How's that?

01:09:42.929 --> 01:09:43.930
That's fine.

01:09:45.557 --> 01:09:46.725
All right.

01:09:58.070 --> 01:10:00.781
I didn't know
exactly how I felt about chase.

01:10:01.531 --> 01:10:03.283
But I was no longer lonely.

01:10:04.159 --> 01:10:05.452
That seemed enough.

01:10:07.662 --> 01:10:09.081
Is that for your book?

01:10:11.958 --> 01:10:14.294
Anyway, who knows if anyone will read it.

01:10:17.214 --> 01:10:18.882
The marsh was our secret.

01:10:29.101 --> 01:10:30.811
Tell me about your friends.

01:10:31.019 --> 01:10:32.938
Oh, I don't really have any friends.

01:10:35.190 --> 01:10:38.235
You always seem to be having
a good time when you're with them.

01:10:38.318 --> 01:10:39.319
You spying on me?

01:10:44.449 --> 01:10:46.034
It's funny. My dad told me once,

01:10:46.118 --> 01:10:49.913
he'd had something to drink
and a fight with my mom.

01:10:51.331 --> 01:10:54.960
He told me if my friends really knew me,
they wouldn't be my friends.

01:10:56.878 --> 01:11:02.342
I don't know if anyone really knows me,
is what I'm saying, I guess.

01:11:06.847 --> 01:11:08.682
I wonder what makes the sky blue.

01:11:10.642 --> 01:11:12.978
Blue and Violet wavelengths from sunlight.

01:11:14.271 --> 01:11:19.151
They, uh, bounce off the gas particles
in the atmosphere and scatter.

01:11:26.616 --> 01:11:27.826
Is it okay if I...

01:11:29.369 --> 01:11:30.370
Kiss you now?

01:11:42.299 --> 01:11:44.843
Let's turn
to the red wool fibers found

01:11:44.926 --> 01:11:46.720
on chase Andrews' denim jacket

01:11:46.803 --> 01:11:48.054
the night he died.

01:11:49.014 --> 01:11:52.225
Did you compare those samples
to this red ski cap?

01:11:52.309 --> 01:11:53.310
Exhibit c.

01:11:53.393 --> 01:11:57.439
Yes. The fibers from the cap
and the jacket matched exactly.

01:11:57.522 --> 01:11:59.274
And where was that cap found?

01:11:59.357 --> 01:12:01.902
It was found
in miss Clark's residence.

01:12:03.612 --> 01:12:07.199
Now, about these red fibers,
is there any way, doctor,

01:12:07.282 --> 01:12:10.160
to determine how long
the fibers had been on the jacket?

01:12:10.243 --> 01:12:13.872
No. We can tell
where they came from, not when.

01:12:13.955 --> 01:12:16.082
And if someone wore this hat often,

01:12:16.166 --> 01:12:19.753
is it possible the fibers would be
in their hair and on their clothes?

01:12:19.836 --> 01:12:23.131
Yes. I would suppose they could.

01:12:23.215 --> 01:12:26.843
So would you agree
that at any time during the years

01:12:26.927 --> 01:12:29.554
that the defendant, miss Clark,
knew chase Andrews,

01:12:29.638 --> 01:12:33.266
the fibers of the hat could have been
transferred onto chase's jacket?

01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:35.894
From what I've seen, yes.

01:12:35.977 --> 01:12:39.314
- At any time they met.
- Yes.

01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:59.000
"Dear miss Clark,
we were fascinated by your manuscript.

01:12:59.751 --> 01:13:02.879
If, as you say,
your materials are already complete,

01:13:03.505 --> 01:13:06.550
we hope to edit
and publish in record time."

01:13:12.430 --> 01:13:15.850
Hey. You're looking
at the new manager of western auto.

01:13:17.936 --> 01:13:19.145
Oh, chase, that's...

01:13:20.105 --> 01:13:22.232
- That's great news.
- Come on. Let's celebrate.

01:13:34.369 --> 01:13:38.164
So they're gonna, uh,
pay you for those drawings?

01:13:40.625 --> 01:13:41.710
Ooh!

01:13:45.255 --> 01:13:47.340
Just don't get too full of yourself,
I guess.

01:13:48.550 --> 01:13:49.551
I wouldn't.

01:13:53.638 --> 01:13:55.849
I know people have disappointed you.

01:13:57.267 --> 01:13:58.810
And I'm sorry for that.

01:14:00.228 --> 01:14:02.355
Getting left by your own family. I mean...

01:14:03.648 --> 01:14:07.193
God, my family's a pain in the ass,
but I don't think I could take that.

01:14:07.777 --> 01:14:10.196
But I want you to know
that I'm gonna take care of you.

01:14:12.073 --> 01:14:13.325
Now I've been promoted,

01:14:13.408 --> 01:14:15.452
I can get you a nice house
when we're married.

01:14:15.535 --> 01:14:17.037
- "Married"?
- Yeah.

01:14:17.662 --> 01:14:20.915
A nice two-story on the beach
with a wraparound veranda.

01:14:26.671 --> 01:14:28.298
What about your parents?

01:14:28.381 --> 01:14:29.841
Have you told them about me?

01:14:30.550 --> 01:14:32.302
What you gotta understand about my folks

01:14:32.385 --> 01:14:35.347
is that if I say you're my choice,
that'd be that.

01:14:35.972 --> 01:14:38.224
They'll fall in love with you
when they get to know ya.

01:14:42.854 --> 01:14:43.855
Come here.

01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:54.783
Oh, by the way, I have to drive over
to asheville in a few days

01:14:54.866 --> 01:14:56.868
to buy goods for my dad's store.

01:14:56.951 --> 01:14:58.787
I was thinking you could come.

01:14:59.579 --> 01:15:01.414
- Celebrate your book and all.
- Oh...

01:15:02.874 --> 01:15:04.834
- There'd be lots of people.
- It doesn't matter.

01:15:04.918 --> 01:15:06.711
You'd be with me. I know everything.

01:15:07.504 --> 01:15:10.256
Hell, you don't have to talk to one soul
if you don't want to.

01:15:11.132 --> 01:15:14.469
Come on. If we're gonna get married,
you need to get out in the world a bit.

01:15:15.637 --> 01:15:17.639
Spread those long wings of yours.

01:15:20.058 --> 01:15:21.601
Come on. It'll be fun.

01:15:29.901 --> 01:15:33.446
It's a two-day job,
so we'll stay the night.

01:15:38.535 --> 01:15:40.328
J“ ...Hold my head up high j“

01:15:42.622 --> 01:15:43.915
incredible, huh?

01:15:45.083 --> 01:15:47.585
J“ makes me feel sweet inside j“

01:16:03.893 --> 01:16:06.396
Hey. It's an adventure. Come on.

01:17:29.229 --> 01:17:33.733
It'll feel better for you later,
the more you do it.

01:17:42.450 --> 01:17:44.160
Hey, I never wanna lose you.

01:17:48.164 --> 01:17:49.958
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:17:51.292 --> 01:17:52.669
I think about it a lot.

01:17:54.295 --> 01:17:56.589
Sneaking out at night to come see you.

01:17:58.550 --> 01:17:59.551
My marsh girl.

01:18:03.555 --> 01:18:05.640
J“ nobody knows j“

01:18:06.641 --> 01:18:08.268
j“ nobody sees j”

01:18:09.227 --> 01:18:11.771
j“ nobody knows but me j“

01:18:15.441 --> 01:18:19.237
hey, you don't have to prove yourself
to anyone. You understand?

01:18:20.738 --> 01:18:22.407
You have me, and I love you.

01:18:26.244 --> 01:18:27.495
I made you something.

01:18:42.427 --> 01:18:44.220
It was a single shell,

01:18:44.304 --> 01:18:47.932
hung on a piece of rawhide,
tied in a tight knot, and it was missing.

01:18:48.016 --> 01:18:52.353
So to be clear, what you're
saying is that the shell necklace

01:18:52.437 --> 01:18:56.274
that chase wore every day
was missing from these items

01:18:56.357 --> 01:19:00.486
that law enforcement recovered
from his body the day that he was found.

01:19:00.987 --> 01:19:02.238
Is that correct?

01:19:02.322 --> 01:19:04.699
- I think it's important.
- Yes.

01:19:05.450 --> 01:19:08.703
He had that necklace on
when he had dinner with us that night.

01:19:09.996 --> 01:19:12.790
And it was gone from his body.

01:19:14.208 --> 01:19:16.210
And what I'm saying is
he never took it off.

01:19:16.711 --> 01:19:18.755
Whoever killed him took it.

01:19:18.838 --> 01:19:21.966
Objection, your honor. It's speculation.

01:19:22.050 --> 01:19:23.176
Sustained.

01:19:23.676 --> 01:19:25.178
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

01:19:25.261 --> 01:19:29.057
you will disregard
that last remark by Mrs. Andrews.

01:19:29.140 --> 01:19:33.603
Mrs. Andrews,
where did chase get this necklace?

01:19:33.686 --> 01:19:37.398
It's from that marsh girl.
Miss Clark.

01:19:38.066 --> 01:19:40.944
I didn't even know her name
or if she even had one.

01:19:42.403 --> 01:19:43.905
I can't see why chase...

01:19:45.073 --> 01:19:46.449
But what I'm saying is,

01:19:47.033 --> 01:19:51.204
she's the only one who'd have
any interest in taking the thing.

01:19:51.287 --> 01:19:52.830
Mrs. Andrews...

01:19:55.083 --> 01:19:58.002
Were chase and miss Clark
romantically involved?

01:19:58.086 --> 01:20:01.047
You could say.
I saw him sneaking out at night.

01:20:01.714 --> 01:20:04.968
When I finally asked him
where he was going, he told me the truth.

01:20:06.177 --> 01:20:08.888
I thought: What would people say?

01:20:10.348 --> 01:20:13.893
I was a silly woman
to be worried about that next to...

01:20:19.607 --> 01:20:23.194
But he told me he broke it off with her.

01:20:24.070 --> 01:20:27.740
She knew she couldn't have him anymore,
so she killed him

01:20:27.824 --> 01:20:30.344
- and took back her ugly necklace!
- Objection, your honor.

01:20:33.871 --> 01:20:34.706
Sustained.

01:20:34.789 --> 01:20:36.589
No further questions,
your honor.

01:20:40.253 --> 01:20:44.298
Um, Mrs. Andrews, you have
my deepest sympathy for your loss.

01:20:44.924 --> 01:20:47.010
With all due respect,

01:20:47.093 --> 01:20:51.806
you are aware that miss Clark's house
was thoroughly searched.

01:20:52.765 --> 01:20:56.394
And that the police did not find
the necklace there.

01:20:56.477 --> 01:20:58.896
- Did they?
- No.

01:21:21.169 --> 01:21:22.170
Hey.

01:21:23.087 --> 01:21:24.464
- I got it.
- Hey.

01:21:25.298 --> 01:21:27.967
- Almost got you.
- Almost knocked me out.

01:21:28.051 --> 01:21:30.011
Just trying to show off.

01:21:31.679 --> 01:21:34.348
What's that marsh girl like
in bed, man? Is she an animal?

01:21:34.432 --> 01:21:37.143
Wild as a bobcat and worth
every bit of the gas money.

01:21:37.685 --> 01:21:39.020
Tell me her eyes glow.

01:21:39.145 --> 01:21:42.265
- Only for me and only when I make them.
- Hey, don't talk about her like that.

01:21:43.858 --> 01:21:46.736
- What's that?
- I said don't talk about her like that.

01:21:46.819 --> 01:21:48.613
Oh, the college boy.

01:21:50.740 --> 01:21:53.326
- He taught the marsh girl her abcs.
- Oh.

01:21:53.409 --> 01:21:55.203
- Mmm.
- You're a waste of her time.

01:21:57.205 --> 01:21:59.373
Go ahead, college boy. What you gonna do?

01:21:59.457 --> 01:22:02.710
- Come on, you're tough, right?
- Come on, let's do something.

01:22:02.794 --> 01:22:06.089
- You wanna hit me?
- Hey, y'all settle down now.

01:22:06.172 --> 01:22:07.173
That's enough.

01:22:09.258 --> 01:22:11.427
Settle down before someone get hurt.

01:22:12.428 --> 01:22:13.721
There's better ways than this.

01:22:34.033 --> 01:22:35.118
Hey, kya.

01:22:38.079 --> 01:22:39.079
Hey, what the hell?

01:22:39.831 --> 01:22:41.999
Wait! Kya, wait! Please.

01:22:42.083 --> 01:22:43.167
Look, I just wanna talk.

01:22:43.251 --> 01:22:45.128
Get out of my lagoon, you dirty creep!

01:22:45.211 --> 01:22:47.046
Kya, please! I just need to talk to you!

01:22:47.130 --> 01:22:48.756
I don't care what you want!

01:22:49.465 --> 01:22:52.051
I never wanna see you again. Ever.

01:22:52.135 --> 01:22:54.053
Kya, I need to talk to you
about chase, okay?

01:22:54.137 --> 01:22:56.889
- About chase?
- He's not good enough for you.

01:22:58.558 --> 01:23:01.352
You're the one who left me.

01:23:03.187 --> 01:23:06.941
Who didn't come back when you promised.
Who never came back.

01:23:09.485 --> 01:23:13.698
You didn't even write to explain
or even to say if you were alive or dead.

01:23:13.781 --> 01:23:14.991
You just disappeared.

01:23:15.074 --> 01:23:18.411
I know. And I'm so sorry, kya,
you have no idea.

01:23:18.494 --> 01:23:21.914
You weren't man enough to face me.

01:23:23.166 --> 01:23:24.292
You're right, kya.

01:23:25.585 --> 01:23:27.211
Everything you say is true.

01:23:28.087 --> 01:23:30.548
Leaving you like that was
the worst thing I've ever done,

01:23:30.631 --> 01:23:32.341
the worst thing I'll ever do in my life.

01:23:33.009 --> 01:23:37.305
I knew how badly I'd hurt you,
and I couldn't face you, like you said.

01:23:40.016 --> 01:23:44.645
I thought you wouldn't be able to leave
the marsh and live in any other world.

01:23:45.479 --> 01:23:49.525
You know, I thought I had to choose
between you and everything else.

01:23:49.609 --> 01:23:52.278
But the truth is, kya,
everything else that I thought mattered,

01:23:52.361 --> 01:23:55.531
the scholarships, the grants, the jobs,
it means nothing without you.

01:23:58.159 --> 01:23:59.368
I was so wrong.

01:24:00.411 --> 01:24:01.996
I've been sorry for years.

01:24:04.582 --> 01:24:06.834
And I'll be sorry for the rest of my life.

01:24:17.803 --> 01:24:18.803
You look...

01:24:31.025 --> 01:24:32.443
I brought you something.

01:24:50.253 --> 01:24:53.422
You know, I'm working
at the new lab near town.

01:24:54.715 --> 01:24:56.342
You'd love it, kya.

01:24:56.425 --> 01:24:58.594
I get to study all this
under a microscope.

01:25:01.931 --> 01:25:03.057
So I'm here now.

01:25:05.476 --> 01:25:06.602
I'm back for good.

01:25:16.654 --> 01:25:18.698
Kya, I would do anything to...

01:25:21.867 --> 01:25:24.078
I would've done
so many things differently.

01:25:32.753 --> 01:25:34.672
What do you want now, Tate?

01:25:34.755 --> 01:25:37.508
Is there any way
that you could possibly forgive me, kya?

01:25:39.927 --> 01:25:40.927
Please?

01:25:43.931 --> 01:25:45.308
I don't know how.

01:26:08.581 --> 01:26:12.668
Kya, I trust you would tell me
if you knew of anyone else

01:26:12.752 --> 01:26:15.338
who had reason to harm chase Andrews.

01:26:20.009 --> 01:26:21.761
Well, all right, then.

01:26:22.511 --> 01:26:23.929
Try and get some rest.

01:26:30.478 --> 01:26:32.188
Oh. Hi.

01:26:32.271 --> 01:26:34.398
Hey. What you doing in town?

01:26:34.482 --> 01:26:38.402
I had some good news from the publisher,
so I thought we could celebrate.

01:26:38.694 --> 01:26:40.414
- I was gonna make...
- There he is.

01:26:47.912 --> 01:26:49.914
Kya, you know Brian, Tina, Pearl.

01:26:50.748 --> 01:26:53.334
- You guys know kya.
- Sure, yeah, the marsh girl.

01:26:54.001 --> 01:26:55.753
Pleased to meet you, kya.

01:26:56.379 --> 01:26:58.214
I'm chase's fiancée.

01:27:00.508 --> 01:27:02.843
All right. Well, I'll see you around, kya.

01:27:45.886 --> 01:27:47.596
Hey, kya. I can explain.

01:27:50.683 --> 01:27:51.767
Are you in there?

01:27:53.853 --> 01:27:55.271
Hey, I just wanna talk.

01:28:01.569 --> 01:28:02.862
I know you're here, damn it!

01:29:04.632 --> 01:29:06.258
Lhad to do life alone.

01:29:08.636 --> 01:29:09.720
But I knew that.

01:29:11.388 --> 01:29:13.057
I'd known for a long time.

01:29:15.226 --> 01:29:16.435
People don't stay.

01:29:28.864 --> 01:29:29.949
"Dear miss Clark,

01:29:30.574 --> 01:29:33.536
enclosed is the final copy
of your beautiful book,

01:29:34.119 --> 01:29:36.455
along with the initial check for delivery,

01:29:36.539 --> 01:29:38.415
with royalties to follow, I'm sure.

01:29:39.917 --> 01:29:42.211
I'm attending a conference
in Greenville next month

01:29:42.294 --> 01:29:45.422
and would love for you to join us
and celebrate this great accomplishment."

01:29:54.181 --> 01:29:56.934
"A full deed for Catherine Danielle Clark

01:29:57.017 --> 01:30:02.314
for 310 acres of lagoons,
marsh, oak forests and beach.

01:30:02.898 --> 01:30:05.985
Wasteland category: Murky swamp."

01:30:27.506 --> 01:30:28.424
Jodie?

01:30:28.507 --> 01:30:31.844
There I am in asheville,
and I see your book in a shop:

01:30:32.595 --> 01:30:34.054
Catherine Danielle Clark.

01:30:34.138 --> 01:30:38.934
And my heart just broke
and leapt forjoy all at once.

01:30:39.018 --> 01:30:40.853
I knew I had to find you.

01:30:41.687 --> 01:30:43.480
I just didn't think you'd still be here.

01:30:44.565 --> 01:30:45.899
What about the others?

01:30:46.734 --> 01:30:49.194
I don't know a thing
about murph, Mandy or missy.

01:30:49.820 --> 01:30:52.239
I wouldn't know them
if I passed them in the street.

01:30:52.865 --> 01:30:53.866
And, um...

01:30:55.868 --> 01:30:56.952
What about ma?

01:31:00.080 --> 01:31:01.915
Ma passed, kya.

01:31:10.257 --> 01:31:12.593
Ma had a sister, Rosemary.

01:31:12.676 --> 01:31:15.554
She found me in the army
and told me what happened.

01:31:15.638 --> 01:31:18.849
Showed up at Rosemary's door
in her alligator shoes.

01:31:18.932 --> 01:31:21.560
Rosemary said she didn't talk for months.

01:31:21.644 --> 01:31:24.521
And then about a year later,
she remembered she had children.

01:31:24.605 --> 01:31:28.150
Rosemary helped her write a letter to pa,
asking if she could come get us.

01:31:29.693 --> 01:31:32.237
And he told her
if she ever so much as contacted us again,

01:31:32.321 --> 01:31:34.031
he'd beat us unrecognizable.

01:31:35.532 --> 01:31:37.117
Yeah, sounds like pa.

01:31:37.201 --> 01:31:39.620
She saved up for lawyers and everything,

01:31:40.371 --> 01:31:41.872
but then she got sick.

01:31:41.955 --> 01:31:42.956
Leukemia.

01:31:43.874 --> 01:31:44.875
She tried, but...

01:31:44.958 --> 01:31:46.377
She never had a chance.

01:31:49.046 --> 01:31:50.381
I've been waiting...

01:31:51.924 --> 01:31:54.093
All these years
for her to walk down the Lane.

01:31:55.928 --> 01:31:58.347
You didn't have a family your whole life,

01:31:59.181 --> 01:32:01.642
and there's nothing I can do
to give you that back.

01:32:02.643 --> 01:32:06.397
But I'd like to come see you
as much as I can get up here.

01:32:11.527 --> 01:32:12.945
Yeah, I'd like that.

01:32:50.315 --> 01:32:51.942
Mabel's gonna be so proud.

01:32:52.025 --> 01:32:53.402
Just one more thing.

01:32:56.071 --> 01:32:57.823
I'll be sure he gets it.

01:32:59.158 --> 01:33:00.325
Thank you, jumpin'.

01:33:05.330 --> 01:33:06.582
How y'all doing?

01:33:06.665 --> 01:33:09.501
One pack of your finest, please, sir.

01:33:09.585 --> 01:33:11.086
And give me some matches.

01:33:11.170 --> 01:33:13.172
- Sure thing.
- "Sure thing."

01:33:14.798 --> 01:33:16.383
Kya Clark.

01:33:17.009 --> 01:33:18.761
Miss Catherine Danielle Clark.

01:33:18.844 --> 01:33:20.721
You wrote a damn book. Come here.

01:33:20.804 --> 01:33:22.723
Wait, wait, wait. I wanna talk to you.

01:33:22.806 --> 01:33:24.725
Don't act like that. Come on.

01:33:25.601 --> 01:33:26.769
Leave me alone.

01:33:29.730 --> 01:33:32.441
Damn, the marsh girl thinks
she's too good for you now.

01:33:33.066 --> 01:33:34.067
Shut up!

01:33:34.151 --> 01:33:36.403
Here you go, sir. It's on the house.

01:33:45.871 --> 01:33:47.456
Thought I might find you here.

01:33:48.832 --> 01:33:50.209
I told you to leave me alone.

01:33:50.292 --> 01:33:53.712
No, I know, but I just...
Listen, I wanted to say I'm sorry.

01:33:53.796 --> 01:33:57.216
Really. I feel bad about
how things turned out.

01:33:58.425 --> 01:33:59.885
"How things turned out"?

01:34:01.345 --> 01:34:02.971
What, you mean how it turned out

01:34:03.055 --> 01:34:05.390
you were engaged
the whole time we were together?

01:34:06.433 --> 01:34:10.020
How it turned out
that you lie to everybody?

01:34:10.103 --> 01:34:12.606
Kya, I have to do things
I don't wanna do. You know that.

01:34:12.689 --> 01:34:15.776
No, I have to get married
to someone like Pearl. I had to.

01:34:15.859 --> 01:34:17.653
But you're the one I really want.

01:34:21.990 --> 01:34:24.243
You know any other man
would have tried to change you?

01:34:25.035 --> 01:34:26.161
To fix you?

01:34:27.496 --> 01:34:28.747
I never did.

01:34:30.249 --> 01:34:33.001
No, no. Please, please, wait.
I need you. I really need you.

01:34:34.586 --> 01:34:36.505
Don't leave me all alone in that place.

01:34:37.339 --> 01:34:38.674
You know, nobody else knows me.

01:34:43.220 --> 01:34:45.055
You know, I feel sorry for you.

01:34:47.224 --> 01:34:49.393
But I want nothing to do with any of that.

01:35:03.615 --> 01:35:04.783
Wilder than ever.

01:35:08.954 --> 01:35:10.455
I know you want this too.

01:35:10.539 --> 01:35:12.416
- Stop!
- I know you want this too.

01:35:18.463 --> 01:35:21.341
You're mine, kya. You belong to me.
I'm not letting you go this time.

01:35:42.154 --> 01:35:44.323
Leave me alone, you bastard!

01:35:45.699 --> 01:35:48.702
You bother me again and I'll kill you!

01:35:49.494 --> 01:35:51.622
She shouted it real loud, sir.

01:35:51.705 --> 01:35:53.749
I heard a commotion, and I come closer,

01:35:53.832 --> 01:35:56.960
see if anybody was in trouble,
and there she was.

01:35:57.044 --> 01:35:59.004
And do you recognize the woman?

01:35:59.796 --> 01:36:03.300
Is she in the courtroom today?

01:36:03.383 --> 01:36:05.677
Yes, that one there. The defendant.

01:36:05.761 --> 01:36:08.263
The one folks call marsh girl.

01:36:13.685 --> 01:36:16.480
I finally understood why
ma had to leave.

01:37:23.338 --> 01:37:25.007
One thing I learned from pa,

01:37:25.674 --> 01:37:27.926
these men have to have the last punch.

01:37:55.829 --> 01:37:57.622
Being isolated was one thing.

01:37:58.790 --> 01:38:01.668
Living in fear, quite another.

01:38:03.670 --> 01:38:05.589
I will never live like that.

01:38:06.798 --> 01:38:10.677
A life wondering
when the next fist will fall.

01:38:32.699 --> 01:38:33.950
Tate, you can't be here.

01:38:34.576 --> 01:38:36.036
I just wanted to check on you.

01:38:36.119 --> 01:38:38.622
- Jumpin' said he hadn't seen you since...
- Not now.

01:38:40.290 --> 01:38:41.875
Kya, what happened to your face?

01:38:42.667 --> 01:38:45.170
Was it chase?
Tell me, kya. Did he do this?

01:38:45.253 --> 01:38:46.880
I need you to stay out of it.

01:38:46.963 --> 01:38:48.298
That son of a bitch.

01:38:49.091 --> 01:38:51.843
- That son of a bitch.
- Tate, I need you to go.

01:38:59.768 --> 01:39:01.853
You know, I was gonna go
to Greenville next week.

01:39:05.107 --> 01:39:06.733
Finally meet my publishers.

01:39:08.944 --> 01:39:10.529
Talk about the next book.

01:39:11.154 --> 01:39:12.489
I was feeling brave enough.

01:39:12.989 --> 01:39:14.616
Well, you can still go.

01:39:14.699 --> 01:39:16.284
Looking like this?

01:39:16.368 --> 01:39:18.120
Don't let him ruin this for you.

01:39:19.329 --> 01:39:20.413
Go to Greenville.

01:39:21.331 --> 01:39:22.916
Okay? There's a bus.

01:39:22.999 --> 01:39:24.793
It's easy. Jumpin's got the schedule.

01:39:25.710 --> 01:39:27.504
Let them put you up in a nice hotel,

01:39:28.171 --> 01:39:30.382
eat some hot restaurant food
you didn't have to make.

01:39:30.465 --> 01:39:32.342
Stay a week, if you can.

01:39:33.343 --> 01:39:36.221
And I'll come see you
when you're back. Okay?

01:39:37.264 --> 01:39:39.057
Hear how it all went with the publishers.

01:39:39.891 --> 01:39:41.017
All right.

01:39:48.525 --> 01:39:49.526
Hey, you cold?

01:39:51.361 --> 01:39:54.281
I'm fine. I don't need you
to take care of me.

01:39:54.364 --> 01:39:56.241
I know, but just take my hat.

01:39:56.867 --> 01:39:58.994
- I said I don't need your help.
- Just take it.

01:40:27.856 --> 01:40:30.400
You wanna tell me
what happened to your eye?

01:40:31.735 --> 01:40:33.820
I need to write down the bus schedule.

01:40:33.904 --> 01:40:35.405
You have a copy, right?

01:40:40.869 --> 01:40:43.663
It was that chase, wasn't it?

01:40:46.208 --> 01:40:47.626
Kya, look at me.

01:40:50.629 --> 01:40:52.547
Now you tell me what he did.

01:40:54.841 --> 01:40:56.092
I can't say it.

01:40:57.719 --> 01:40:58.803
It's over now.

01:40:59.596 --> 01:41:01.389
I just want it out of my life.

01:41:01.473 --> 01:41:03.725
And how you know
he ain't coming after you again?

01:41:05.018 --> 01:41:07.729
- You're all by your lonesome out there.
- Jumpin', please.

01:41:09.022 --> 01:41:10.815
You can't tell anybody.

01:41:11.441 --> 01:41:12.651
You know how it is.

01:41:12.734 --> 01:41:17.948
They'd drag me into the sheriff's office
and make me describe it to a bunch of men.

01:41:19.199 --> 01:41:22.619
And then write me up in the papers,
accusing me of whoring.

01:41:23.703 --> 01:41:25.789
Or trying to get money out of his parents.

01:41:26.665 --> 01:41:28.333
Okay? They'd do nothing about it.

01:41:28.416 --> 01:41:29.459
You're right, kya.

01:41:32.045 --> 01:41:34.506
And I ain't gonna do anything
to make this thing worse.

01:41:36.758 --> 01:41:40.011
But you let me know
when you're coming and going.

01:41:40.095 --> 01:41:41.137
You hear?

01:41:41.972 --> 01:41:43.848
I gotta know if you're out of town.

01:41:47.269 --> 01:41:50.438
'Cause if I don't see you for a while...

01:41:55.819 --> 01:41:57.153
Thank you, jumpin'.

01:41:58.238 --> 01:41:59.906
I'm leaving in a few days.

01:42:01.616 --> 01:42:03.243
I'll come see you as soon as I'm back.

01:42:05.578 --> 01:42:06.663
Okay, that's good.

01:42:07.622 --> 01:42:08.623
That's good.

01:42:12.544 --> 01:42:16.840
Miss price, would you tell us
what you saw on the morning of October 29?

01:42:16.923 --> 01:42:18.883
I saw the marsh girl...

01:42:18.967 --> 01:42:20.635
Miss Clark, that is. Pardon me.

01:42:20.719 --> 01:42:23.763
- Get on the 9:00 bus.
- You've got quite a good memory.

01:42:23.847 --> 01:42:24.889
We all talked about it.

01:42:24.973 --> 01:42:27.434
We 'd never seen her
all cleaned up like that.

01:42:27.517 --> 01:42:28.852
Hair combed, makeup.

01:42:29.686 --> 01:42:34.024
Just to be clear,
on the morning of October 29,

01:42:34.107 --> 01:42:38.903
you and several others saw
miss Clark board the 9 am. Bus

01:42:38.987 --> 01:42:40.822
and leave barkley cove.

01:42:40.905 --> 01:42:42.866
- Yes, that's right.
- Thank you, miss price.

01:42:42.949 --> 01:42:44.576
No further questions, your honor.

01:42:44.659 --> 01:42:49.164
Miss price, is the piggly wiggly open
at 1:30 in the morning?

01:42:49.789 --> 01:42:50.957
No, sir.

01:42:52.042 --> 01:42:53.668
Well, the reason I ask is,

01:42:54.252 --> 01:42:57.422
you couldn't have seen who got off
the night bus from Greenville,

01:42:57.964 --> 01:43:00.675
nor could you have seen
who got on the 2:30 am. Bus

01:43:00.759 --> 01:43:04.304
from barkley cove
back to Greenville, could you?

01:43:04.387 --> 01:43:06.056
Well, no. Of course not.

01:43:06.139 --> 01:43:10.977
So after you saw miss Clark board
that morning bus to Greenville...

01:43:12.729 --> 01:43:15.523
She could have returned
to barkley cove that night

01:43:15.607 --> 01:43:19.527
and been back in Greenville for breakfast,
all without you taking notice.

01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:21.821
My name is Robert foster.

01:43:21.905 --> 01:43:25.116
I'm a senior editor
at Harrison Morris publishing company

01:43:25.200 --> 01:43:26.284
in Boston, Massachusetts.

01:43:26.368 --> 01:43:30.663
Mr. Foster, you sat down
for dinner with miss Clark at 7 pm.

01:43:30.747 --> 01:43:32.791
On the night of October 29.

01:43:32.874 --> 01:43:34.125
- Correct?
- Yes.

01:43:34.209 --> 01:43:36.252
What was your first impression of her?

01:43:37.754 --> 01:43:43.385
My first impression was, uh, that she was
very shy, very gentle, very smart.

01:43:44.344 --> 01:43:46.137
I knew that she was something
of a recluse,

01:43:46.221 --> 01:43:49.099
but I also knew
that she was a gifted naturalist.

01:43:49.182 --> 01:43:52.143
- How long did that dinner go on?
- At least a few hours.

01:43:52.227 --> 01:43:53.987
Some female insects do eat
their mates.

01:43:54.020 --> 01:43:56.815
Fireflies, in fact,
have two different light signals.

01:43:57.315 --> 01:43:58.441
One for mating,

01:43:58.525 --> 01:44:01.528
and one to attract a male
in order to make him her next meal.

01:44:01.611 --> 01:44:03.422
- So she eats him?
- How gruesome.

01:44:03.446 --> 01:44:06.116
- Oh, dear.
- I must spend less time with insects.

01:44:06.199 --> 01:44:08.535
- It's quite amoral.
- Amoral, indeed.

01:44:08.618 --> 01:44:10.954
I don't know
if there is a dark side to nature.

01:44:12.705 --> 01:44:14.499
Just inventive ways to endure.

01:44:15.792 --> 01:44:16.876
Against all odds.

01:44:16.960 --> 01:44:21.548
And when you met with miss Clark
the following morning, October 30th,

01:44:21.631 --> 01:44:25.593
was there anything unusual
about her appearance or her demeanor?

01:44:25.677 --> 01:44:26.845
Not at all.

01:44:27.470 --> 01:44:29.139
No further questions, your honor.

01:44:29.222 --> 01:44:31.724
Mr. Foster, did miss Clark stay

01:44:31.808 --> 01:44:34.394
at the same hotel
as you and your colleagues?

01:44:34.477 --> 01:44:37.105
No. She preferred a smaller hotel.

01:44:37.188 --> 01:44:39.732
The, uh, mountain something.

01:44:39.816 --> 01:44:43.069
Could you look at this map
of Greenville for me, please?

01:44:43.153 --> 01:44:47.740
I think you'll see the piedmont,
where you and your colleagues stayed,

01:44:47.824 --> 01:44:51.828
and then the three mountains hotel,
where miss Clark stayed.

01:44:51.911 --> 01:44:55.415
Could you tell me
which one is closest to the bus station?

01:44:57.083 --> 01:44:59.502
The three mountains hotel is closer.

01:44:59.586 --> 01:45:03.214
In fact, the three mountains is
the closest hotel

01:45:03.298 --> 01:45:05.508
to the Greenville bus station.
Is that correct?

01:45:06.801 --> 01:45:07.927
Looks that way.

01:45:08.803 --> 01:45:10.430
No further questions.

01:45:10.513 --> 01:45:14.017
I don't think a good lawyer ever puts
their client on the stand,

01:45:14.100 --> 01:45:15.685
but this might help you.

01:45:16.394 --> 01:45:20.690
For the jury to be able
to hear from you, directly.

01:45:21.941 --> 01:45:25.028
For them to be able to see you...

01:45:26.404 --> 01:45:28.990
As the kind
and thoughtful person you truly are.

01:45:29.073 --> 01:45:30.700
They're never gonna see me like that.

01:45:30.783 --> 01:45:34.204
Listen. I know you have a world
of reasons to hate these people...

01:45:34.287 --> 01:45:35.705
No, I never hated them.

01:45:35.788 --> 01:45:37.290
They hated me.

01:45:38.625 --> 01:45:41.794
They laughed at me. They left me.

01:45:42.378 --> 01:45:44.756
They harassed me. They attacked me.

01:45:44.839 --> 01:45:47.717
You... you want me to beg for my life?

01:45:48.885 --> 01:45:50.094
I don't have it in me.

01:45:50.720 --> 01:45:51.721
I won't.

01:45:53.556 --> 01:45:56.142
I will not offer myself up.

01:45:56.226 --> 01:45:57.685
They can make their decision.

01:46:00.230 --> 01:46:03.900
But they're not deciding
anything about me.

01:46:05.902 --> 01:46:06.903
It's them.

01:46:08.821 --> 01:46:10.281
They're judging themselves.

01:46:13.034 --> 01:46:14.160
All right, then.

01:46:21.543 --> 01:46:24.712
Mr. Milton,
you have always been kind to me.

01:46:26.214 --> 01:46:27.465
Even as a child.

01:46:29.259 --> 01:46:30.468
I never forgot.

01:46:40.645 --> 01:46:44.357
His life was cut short
by the jilted lover

01:46:44.440 --> 01:46:47.652
who could not accept
that he had returned to the fold.

01:46:48.194 --> 01:46:52.657
A witness saw miss Clark
and chase in the marsh.

01:46:52.740 --> 01:46:55.493
Heard her say the words "I'll kill you."

01:46:56.077 --> 01:46:57.412
And what's more,

01:46:57.495 --> 01:47:01.791
is there's physical evidence
from that night connecting them.

01:47:02.500 --> 01:47:05.461
Fibers from her red wool cap

01:47:05.962 --> 01:47:07.839
left on his denim jacket.

01:47:07.922 --> 01:47:09.465
Dad, I'm going over to deal with it.

01:47:09.549 --> 01:47:12.510
Who else would have motive
to take that shell neck/ace?

01:47:14.512 --> 01:47:17.015
You can, and you must,

01:47:17.098 --> 01:47:21.686
find that the defendant is guilty
of first-degree murder.

01:47:31.487 --> 01:47:32.614
Mr. Milton.

01:47:48.379 --> 01:47:52.592
I have lived in barkley cove
my whole life.

01:47:53.760 --> 01:47:57.764
And like you, I heard the tall tales

01:47:57.847 --> 01:47:59.766
told about the marsh girl.

01:48:00.308 --> 01:48:02.602
That she was part wolf.

01:48:02.685 --> 01:48:06.356
A missing link between ape and man.

01:48:06.856 --> 01:48:09.317
That her eyes glowed in the dark.

01:48:11.069 --> 01:48:13.780
Well, here she is.

01:48:14.656 --> 01:48:18.576
The reality is that she was
an abandoned child.

01:48:18.660 --> 01:48:23.164
A little girl surviving out there
in the marsh on her own,

01:48:23.247 --> 01:48:25.875
reviled and shunned.

01:48:28.836 --> 01:48:32.256
Mr. James Madison and his wife, Mabel,

01:48:32.340 --> 01:48:34.592
they are sitting here
in the courtroom today.

01:48:34.676 --> 01:48:38.596
They're about the only people
in this town who showed her any care.

01:48:38.680 --> 01:48:40.056
The rest of us...

01:48:42.517 --> 01:48:44.394
Well, I'm ashamed to say

01:48:45.561 --> 01:48:51.150
that we labeled her and rejected her
because we thought she was different.

01:48:51.859 --> 01:48:53.152
And now...

01:48:55.071 --> 01:48:58.825
The job ofjudging this shy
and rejected young woman

01:48:58.908 --> 01:49:01.494
has fallen on your shoulders.

01:49:01.577 --> 01:49:06.999
But you must base your judgment
on the facts presented in this courtroom,

01:49:07.083 --> 01:49:13.172
and not on the rumors and feelings
from the past 25 years.

01:49:13.256 --> 01:49:16.175
Miss Clark has a solid alibi.

01:49:16.259 --> 01:49:19.595
She was in Greenville
the night chase Andrews died.

01:49:19.679 --> 01:49:24.517
And what facts, exactly,
stand against her?

01:49:26.352 --> 01:49:31.315
The state has not proven
that this incident was indeed a murder,

01:49:31.399 --> 01:49:34.485
and not just some tragic accident.

01:49:35.528 --> 01:49:39.198
The state wants you to believe
that at 11:30 at night,

01:49:39.282 --> 01:49:41.826
without a single witness seeing her,

01:49:41.909 --> 01:49:45.288
she caught the last bus
from Greenville to barkley cove,

01:49:45.371 --> 01:49:47.999
and rode that bus disguised,

01:49:48.082 --> 01:49:51.419
since neither of the bus drivers
that night could identify her

01:49:51.502 --> 01:49:54.630
as a passenger,
all the way back to barkley cove.

01:49:54.714 --> 01:49:58.468
And then, in less than an hour...

01:50:00.178 --> 01:50:03.014
She tracks down chase Andrews
in the middle of the night,

01:50:03.097 --> 01:50:05.600
lures him to the tower, murders him,

01:50:05.683 --> 01:50:07.769
wipes away all physical evidence,

01:50:07.852 --> 01:50:12.732
and somehow catches
the 2:30 am. Bus back to Greenville.

01:50:12.815 --> 01:50:15.318
Again,
without a single witness seeing her.

01:50:15.401 --> 01:50:18.321
And after doing all that,

01:50:19.572 --> 01:50:23.034
she meets with her publishers
the next morning, unruffled.

01:50:23.117 --> 01:50:25.036
Now, these are not facts.

01:50:25.953 --> 01:50:28.790
These are just more of the rumors

01:50:28.873 --> 01:50:34.253
and tall tales that we have been spreading
about miss Clark her entire life.

01:50:35.087 --> 01:50:39.050
I believe you will come
to a judgment based on the facts,

01:50:39.133 --> 01:50:42.512
and not the gossip
that you have heard for years.

01:50:43.554 --> 01:50:45.848
It's time, at last,

01:50:46.933 --> 01:50:51.020
for all of us to be fair
to the marsh girl.

01:50:53.231 --> 01:50:55.483
Maybe you should go home
and do your waiting there.

01:50:55.566 --> 01:50:58.152
Six hours already.
How long do you think they'll take?

01:50:58.236 --> 01:51:00.613
Well, let's hope
they take a good long while.

01:51:00.696 --> 01:51:04.575
If a fewjurors have doubts,
we got a chance.

01:51:19.298 --> 01:51:22.677
Mr. Foreman, is it correct
that the jury has reached a verdict?

01:51:23.177 --> 01:51:24.387
We have, your honor.

01:51:38.609 --> 01:51:42.530
The defendant will please rise
for the reading of the verdict.

01:51:47.618 --> 01:51:48.619
Stand up.

01:51:58.588 --> 01:52:02.925
"We, the jury, find the defendant,
Catherine Danielle Clark...

01:52:04.218 --> 01:52:09.599
Not guilty of first-degree murder
of Mr. Chase Andrews."

01:52:15.897 --> 01:52:18.274
Miss Clark, you are free to go.

01:52:18.357 --> 01:52:22.278
And I apologize, on behalf of the state,
for the time that you have served.

01:52:22.361 --> 01:52:24.113
This court is dismissed.

01:52:28.367 --> 01:52:29.368
Thank you.

01:52:35.499 --> 01:52:36.500
Come here.

01:52:39.045 --> 01:52:41.672
You're okay. You're all right.

01:52:43.382 --> 01:52:46.719
You just forget about this nonsense.
We're looking foward to the next book.

01:53:02.026 --> 01:53:03.361
Can you take me home?

01:53:51.742 --> 01:53:53.703
Now I can finally admit.

01:53:54.829 --> 01:53:59.208
All the months in isolation,
yearning to be back in the marsh,

01:53:59.875 --> 01:54:02.712
it was knowing
how much was left to explore,

01:54:03.671 --> 01:54:06.132
how much life to uncover in the wild,

01:54:06.215 --> 01:54:07.383
that kept me going.

01:54:09.635 --> 01:54:10.886
And the hope,

01:54:11.721 --> 01:54:13.097
always that hope...

01:54:14.682 --> 01:54:16.642
That one day I could share it...

01:54:19.020 --> 01:54:21.856
With the only person
I had ever truly loved.

01:55:11.947 --> 01:55:12.947
Hey.

01:55:13.657 --> 01:55:15.034
You know I love you, right?

01:56:19.723 --> 01:56:20.723
What?

01:56:21.433 --> 01:56:24.270
Will you, uh...? Sorry. I'm sorry.

01:56:27.064 --> 01:56:28.232
Will you marry me?

01:56:29.900 --> 01:56:31.152
I mean, do you want to?

01:56:34.864 --> 01:56:36.282
Well, aren't we already?

01:56:38.033 --> 01:56:39.034
Like geese?

01:56:42.163 --> 01:56:43.831
I can live with that, I guess.

01:56:46.500 --> 01:56:47.501
Come here.

01:56:59.638 --> 01:57:01.640
Oh, here we go.

01:57:01.724 --> 01:57:02.641
Hey.

01:57:02.725 --> 01:57:04.768
Hey, you. Hi, there.

01:57:10.816 --> 01:57:12.443
Come here, baby girl.

01:57:14.445 --> 01:57:16.488
He loved you so much.

01:57:26.957 --> 01:57:28.876
Kya. Look at that.

01:57:28.959 --> 01:57:31.545
You see that up there?
On the elbow of that branch?

01:57:33.589 --> 01:57:35.799
When's the last time we saw one of those?

01:57:36.884 --> 01:57:37.885
I know.

01:57:42.348 --> 01:57:45.392
This book's pretty good.
This guy's still talking about...

01:57:59.490 --> 01:58:01.450
I hope when it is time
for me to leave,

01:58:01.533 --> 01:58:04.703
I will go quick and easy,
without making too much noise.

01:58:36.277 --> 01:58:37.277
Kya?

01:59:17.026 --> 01:59:18.736
It has always been enough...

01:59:19.820 --> 01:59:22.448
To be part of the natural sequence
of things.

01:59:23.866 --> 01:59:25.159
Sure as the tides.

01:59:25.993 --> 01:59:27.369
Nature my guide.

01:59:31.999 --> 01:59:34.043
The marsh knows all about death...

01:59:37.046 --> 01:59:39.673
And doesn't necessarily
define it as tragedy.

01:59:40.841 --> 01:59:42.259
Certainly not a sin.

01:59:44.011 --> 01:59:48.057
It understands that every creature
does what it must to survive.

01:59:50.726 --> 01:59:53.896
And that sometimes, for prey to live...

01:59:55.105 --> 01:59:56.857
Its predator must die.

02:00:25.135 --> 02:00:26.470
I am the marsh now.

02:00:28.555 --> 02:00:30.140
I am the feather of an egret.

02:00:31.433 --> 02:00:33.936
I am every shell washed upon the shore.

02:00:37.731 --> 02:00:39.108
I am a firefly.

02:00:40.150 --> 02:00:43.612
You'll see hundreds beckoning far
into the dark reaches of the marsh.

02:00:44.738 --> 02:00:46.782
And that's where you will always find me.

02:00:47.991 --> 02:00:49.243
Way out yonder.

02:00:49.952 --> 02:00:51.412
Where the crawdads sing.

02:00:59.962 --> 02:01:05.551
J“ oh, Carolina creeks running j“
