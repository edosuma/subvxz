01:34.500 --> 01:36.548
The scream of that whistle is saying,

01:36.648 --> 01:39.155
"Clear the track,
give us the right of way."

01:39.255 --> 01:43.059
This is a special train, roaring
through the California countryside.

01:43.426 --> 01:48.573
Its destination: The scene of the
latest outbreak by gun runners.

01:48.890 --> 01:51.864
A mystified man
is Sheriff Ted Osbourne.

01:52.185 --> 01:56.005
30 years in office with an
outstanding record behind him.

01:56.105 --> 02:00.635
Faced now with finding a train
which is 3 hours and 32 minutes...

02:00.735 --> 02:02.036
overdue.

02:02.278 --> 02:04.764
Three hours and
thirty two minutes late.

02:04.864 --> 02:08.589
Hope we don't find her piled up
like the other one.

02:31.057 --> 02:33.626
It's Schmidt, the brakeman
from the missing train.

02:33.726 --> 02:34.877
Sheriff.

02:34.977 --> 02:36.278
Over here.

02:37.480 --> 02:39.782
It's the engineer and fireman.

02:42.485 --> 02:44.178
Search every inch of the
ground, and bring in

02:44.278 --> 02:46.205
anything that'll give
us some information.

02:46.322 --> 02:49.091
We've got to find that missing train.

02:49.408 --> 02:50.709
Murderers.

02:51.410 --> 02:53.178
I can't understand it.

02:53.663 --> 02:57.593
What could they gain by killing these
boys and emptying out the cars?

02:57.875 --> 02:59.427
Just this, Sheriff.

02:59.669 --> 03:03.865
That hijacked train is three hours
and thirty two minutes ahead of you.

03:03.965 --> 03:06.166
When that poll links
was thrown of the car,

03:06.266 --> 03:08.220
it was replaced with guns.

03:08.427 --> 03:10.121
To be smuggled
out of the country

03:10.222 --> 03:13.233
along a lonely stretch of track
on the border.

04:43.147 --> 04:45.449
Move on through there, fellas.

04:54.242 --> 04:55.885
Hey, here she comes.

05:01.082 --> 05:03.601
Roy, that train isn't going to stop.

05:07.588 --> 05:09.031
Well, that's funny.

05:09.131 --> 05:10.825
Maybe they didn't get the orders.

05:10.925 --> 05:12.041
Listen, I'll cut over the hill.

05:12.141 --> 05:14.245
Maybe I can stop them
before they get to the crossing.

05:14.345 --> 05:16.067
Hold the cattle here.

06:39.847 --> 06:41.239
Hi, Roy!

06:41.849 --> 06:43.150
Hi, Splinters.

06:43.309 --> 06:45.828
Go on down to the depot, fellas.
I'll meet you there.

06:46.687 --> 06:48.965
That was an old friend of mine, Roy Rogers.

06:49.065 --> 06:53.290
We used to be deputies together
under Sheriff Tad Osbourne.

06:55.363 --> 06:57.390
Got the hiccups again, Splinters?

06:57.490 --> 06:59.934
Yeah, I always get 'em
when I get excited.

07:00.034 --> 07:02.019
Must've been over seeing
my old friend, Roy.

07:02.119 --> 07:03.762
Never mind the shave.

07:03.996 --> 07:07.800
Oh, have a haircut, Mr. Bathernaby,
I mean Mr. Abernathy.

07:08.417 --> 07:10.945
Oh, alright, but make it fast.
I'm in a hurry.

07:11.045 --> 07:13.347
Oh, I'll have you out of here in no time.

07:26.852 --> 07:30.326
Now, that didn't take long.
Did it Mr. Abernathy?

07:32.441 --> 07:33.444
Yes, sir.

07:33.544 --> 07:34.544
That'll be 50 cents.

07:34.652 --> 07:35.953
Put in on my...

07:40.449 --> 07:42.751
Take him in the station there.

07:51.669 --> 07:53.095
They're all dead.

07:53.629 --> 07:55.781
Because the Sheriff didn't protect them.

07:55.881 --> 07:57.783
Yeah, what we need is a new Sheriff!

07:57.883 --> 08:00.036
Why don't you get out and
let your deputies have a chance!

08:00.136 --> 08:01.454
You're too long in office!

08:01.554 --> 08:03.606
When do we get
some action around here?

08:14.775 --> 08:17.544
- What is it Roy?
- Tad just brought in some bodies.

08:38.883 --> 08:40.400
Excuse me, please.

08:46.974 --> 08:48.484
Ladies and gentlemen!

08:48.584 --> 08:49.602
Who's he?

08:49.702 --> 08:52.338
Oh, that's Gordon McKnight.
He lives on the outskirts of town.

08:52.438 --> 08:53.535
He's a retired lawyer.

08:53.636 --> 08:54.965
Lived in border town
about six months.

08:55.065 --> 08:56.065
Ladies and gentlemen.

08:56.166 --> 08:58.636
As a citizen of this community,
I feel your unjustly

08:58.736 --> 09:00.388
accusing your Sheriff and mine.

09:00.488 --> 09:02.848
Aw, he may be your Sheriff,
but not ours.

09:02.948 --> 09:06.102
And you'll find out in four days
when the election comes up.

09:06.202 --> 09:08.971
I'm going around to the side door
and have a talk with the Sheriff.

09:12.666 --> 09:15.139
Uncle Tad, you don't
have to stand for that.

09:15.377 --> 09:17.780
Oh, you can't blame them, I guess.

09:17.880 --> 09:19.490
I couldn't find a thing.

09:19.590 --> 09:22.618
No clues. Nothing.
Not even a trail to follow.

09:22.718 --> 09:24.816
But, that isn't your fault.

09:25.513 --> 09:27.065
Maybe I am too old.

09:28.224 --> 09:30.401
Like poor old Sherlock here.

09:32.561 --> 09:35.410
It'd serve them right if you did quit.

09:46.992 --> 09:48.018
You get out of here.

09:48.118 --> 09:49.520
Oh, I just wanted to see the Sheriff.

09:49.620 --> 09:51.797
How'd you get in? That door was locked.

09:52.581 --> 09:53.973
- Was it?
- Look.

09:54.166 --> 09:55.901
Everybody's been bothering my uncle.

09:56.001 --> 09:57.445
He doesn't want to talk to anyone.

09:57.545 --> 09:58.846
I think he'll talk to me.

10:01.632 --> 10:04.135
Now, you get out of here or
I'll sic this dog on you.

10:05.219 --> 10:06.228
Hey.

10:06.328 --> 10:07.435
He looks ferocious.

10:07.555 --> 10:09.707
He'd probably tear me to ribbons.

10:09.807 --> 10:10.849
Sherlock, no!

10:10.949 --> 10:12.150
Hi, Sherlock!

10:16.230 --> 10:17.715
That a boy, Sherlock.

10:17.815 --> 10:20.217
That's the way to greet
the best deputy I ever had.

10:20.317 --> 10:22.011
I didn't know he'd be this glad to see me.

10:22.111 --> 10:23.929
Of course he is and so am I.

10:24.029 --> 10:25.264
Hiya, Tad.

10:25.364 --> 10:27.183
This is my favorite niece.

10:27.283 --> 10:29.685
Dixie, I don't think
you've ever met Roy Rogers.

10:29.785 --> 10:30.803
How you do?

10:30.903 --> 10:33.063
I'm sorry. I didn't realize
you were such good friends.

10:33.163 --> 10:34.190
You been too long in office!

10:34.290 --> 10:35.774
Why don't you quit you!

10:35.874 --> 10:38.444
Why don't you get out!
What we need's a new sheriff!

10:38.544 --> 10:40.437
I'm going to step out, Roy.

10:40.629 --> 10:43.307
If they want a new sheriff,
they can have one.

10:45.217 --> 10:46.517
Hey, Tad.

10:47.344 --> 10:50.122
That's not like you,
running away from trouble.

10:50.222 --> 10:51.990
A man's got his pride.

10:54.643 --> 10:57.287
My term's up anyhow
in another four days.

10:57.479 --> 10:59.122
Four more days, huh?

10:59.398 --> 11:01.621
Well, I guess you know what you're doing.

11:01.942 --> 11:04.165
Sherlock, you're getting old.

11:05.154 --> 11:08.253
I guess you're going to have
to turn in your badge, too.

11:08.824 --> 11:11.852
Your boss can't take it
on the chin any longer.

11:11.952 --> 11:13.854
I guess he's forgotten
a lot of things.

11:13.954 --> 11:16.687
Like when that border gang
was rustling cattle.

11:16.788 --> 11:18.225
We were stumped then, too.

11:18.417 --> 11:20.621
The whole county was riding us.

11:21.211 --> 11:22.988
But, Tad figured it out.

11:23.088 --> 11:25.991
He didn't quit because a crowd
of people was yapping at him.

11:26.091 --> 11:28.439
Seemed like that was always happening.

11:28.552 --> 11:31.105
I could name you
at least a dozen times.

11:31.263 --> 11:33.791
Too bad Tad didn't quit
when he was on top.

11:33.891 --> 11:37.035
When he could walk down the
street and hold his head up.

11:37.311 --> 11:41.661
30 years in office and he runs out
four days before his term is up.

11:41.857 --> 11:45.878
It isn't much time to work, but at
least we could've gone out trying.

11:47.237 --> 11:49.431
Did you say, “We could have?"

11:49.531 --> 11:52.017
Yes, Tad. I'd like to have my badge back.

11:52.117 --> 11:53.717
You know that train that
was wrecked this morning?

11:53.820 --> 11:54.820
Yeah.

11:54.920 --> 11:56.622
Well, I was on it for a minute.

11:56.789 --> 11:59.091
You see, I've got a personal score
to settle in this town,

11:59.192 --> 12:00.250
if it's alright with you.

12:00.350 --> 12:02.018
All right with me?

12:02.461 --> 12:05.864
We've always been able to get a
job done, Roy, working together.

12:05.964 --> 12:08.450
Maybe it'll be like... like old times.

12:08.550 --> 12:10.744
- Uncle Tad!
- Roy said what I should have.

12:10.844 --> 12:12.329
At least I can go out trying.

12:12.429 --> 12:14.823
Now what was this about
you being on that train?

12:15.916 --> 12:16.917
Wait a minute.

12:17.017 --> 12:20.412
You talk about that train later.
I've got a job to do.

12:28.570 --> 12:30.417
All of ya! On your way!

12:30.906 --> 12:34.018
I am declaring this a mob
and unlawful assembly.

12:34.118 --> 12:37.271
Now, you'll either go on about
your business, or you'll all go to jail!

12:37.371 --> 12:39.201
I've got four more days in office,

12:39.302 --> 12:41.191
and until that's over,
I'm still sheriff here!

12:41.291 --> 12:43.434
Now, go on home, all of ya!

12:45.629 --> 12:47.556
Go on your way now!

12:56.557 --> 12:57.833
That's the spirit, Sheriff.

12:57.933 --> 13:00.461
Thanks. We'll get things done now.

13:00.561 --> 13:02.921
I've got my old deputy back.
I want you to meet Roy Rogers.

13:03.021 --> 13:04.994
- How are ya?
- How ya do?

13:08.402 --> 13:10.262
I have to go send a telegram.
I'll see you later.

13:10.362 --> 13:11.663
All right, Roy.

13:12.322 --> 13:14.058
Here's the guy that broke
the window, Sheriff.

13:14.158 --> 13:16.310
Do you want me
to put him behind bars?

13:16.410 --> 13:17.711
No, let him go.

13:18.036 --> 13:19.679
You're pretty lucky.

13:19.997 --> 13:22.232
Well, if you need me any more,
I'll be in my barber shop.

13:22.332 --> 13:23.633
Just a minute.

13:24.835 --> 13:26.945
What are you doing, Tad?

13:27.045 --> 13:28.322
I need a shave.

13:28.422 --> 13:31.521
But, I want to scare
the hiccups outta ya first.

13:32.134 --> 13:33.435
They gone?

13:34.720 --> 13:37.148
Yeah, yeah! Come on!

13:44.188 --> 13:46.454
Sherlock, I knew
you'd stick by Tad

13:46.555 --> 13:48.593
no matter what anybody
thought of him.

13:49.109 --> 13:52.288
So, you might as well
have your badge back.

13:59.369 --> 14:00.876
Hey, Johnny.

14:01.246 --> 14:02.247
How about it?

14:02.347 --> 14:03.548
Yeah, why not?

14:33.445 --> 14:35.013
Fielders, how are you?

14:35.113 --> 14:36.348
What's your pleasure?
What are you having?

14:36.448 --> 14:38.642
- Give us your best poison.
- Make it two.

14:38.742 --> 14:40.043
Juanes.

14:46.166 --> 14:47.943
Here, you could use a little
bit of this, too. You've

14:48.043 --> 14:49.737
been rolling around in
that skunk cabbage again.

14:49.837 --> 14:50.838
Splinters.

14:50.938 --> 14:53.699
How many times
do I have to tell you

14:53.799 --> 14:55.743
when you're making a report
to call me Chief.

14:55.843 --> 14:58.287
Ok, Chief. I have a little tip for you.

14:58.387 --> 15:00.372
Thatta girl, let's have it.

15:00.472 --> 15:02.166
We split the reward 50/50?

15:02.266 --> 15:04.076
Sure, sure, sure.
What's the tip?

15:04.176 --> 15:06.798
Two strangers in town.
Very suspicious.

15:06.899 --> 15:08.772
They are in the Cantina now.

15:09.272 --> 15:11.859
Thanks, Carmelita.
We'll find out who they are.

15:11.959 --> 15:13.160
Ok, chief.

15:13.652 --> 15:15.954
I'll be right back.
I gotta see the Sheriff.

15:18.282 --> 15:21.018
Hey, Sheriff, I got
some hot info for ya.

15:21.118 --> 15:23.604
Are you sure this isn't
another one of your brainstorms?

15:23.704 --> 15:26.440
No. There are two big time
criminals in the cantina.

15:26.540 --> 15:28.692
Probably armed to the teeth.

15:30.085 --> 15:31.978
Well, I better look-see.

15:32.337 --> 15:33.614
Who told you about this?

15:33.714 --> 15:36.241
Never divulge the source of
your information, Sheriff.

15:36.341 --> 15:38.660
But, I got operators spotted all over town.

15:40.262 --> 15:43.332
There's always the chance that
just once you might be right.

15:43.432 --> 15:45.284
Now, wait for me, Sheriff.

15:48.737 --> 15:50.706
"Taking short vacation." Stop

15:50.807 --> 15:52.750
"Explanation will arrive with cattle."

15:52.850 --> 15:54.050
Signed, Roy Rogers.

15:54.151 --> 15:56.553
I'll get this right off the
packing house, Mr. Rogers.

15:56.653 --> 15:58.375
That'll be four bits.

15:59.156 --> 16:00.891
When do you think
you can pick up those cattle?

16:00.991 --> 16:03.727
I don't know. You know,
this is the second wreck we had?

16:03.827 --> 16:06.522
Maybe in a couple of days
I'll get back on schedule.

16:06.622 --> 16:07.923
Thanks.

16:08.457 --> 16:09.608
Foy.

16:09.708 --> 16:12.194
I'll help you load those cattle
when he fixes us up with a train.

16:12.294 --> 16:13.821
Then you better take over for me.

16:13.921 --> 16:15.781
I'm going to stick around a few
days and help the Sheriff.

16:15.881 --> 16:17.182
Ok, Roy.

16:18.175 --> 16:19.475
Roy!

16:26.600 --> 16:28.585
Two suspicious characters in the cantina.

16:28.685 --> 16:31.338
According to Splinters,
we may have our first hot lead.

16:31.438 --> 16:33.131
You better come along with us, too, Foy.

16:33.231 --> 16:34.436
We'll go in separately,

16:34.537 --> 16:36.555
so if they see us,
they won't get suspicious.

16:40.781 --> 16:43.550
Take it easy, Sherlock. Take it easy.

17:05.388 --> 17:07.316
Muy bueno los taritos, eh Señor?

17:07.683 --> 17:09.656
Diez centavos, por favor.

17:10.644 --> 17:11.944
Can't you read?

17:12.396 --> 17:15.369
Tepo de Sheriff?
Oh, Si, Si, Señor.

17:15.857 --> 17:18.010
Hey! Hora vey as de cuan dinado.

17:18.109 --> 17:19.094
Hey, wait a minute!

17:19.194 --> 17:21.262
- He's a deputy, too!
- Es deputy, too?

17:21.363 --> 17:24.666
Well, why don't you tell
me these things? Ok!

17:52.310 --> 17:53.587
Hey, what's going on here?

17:53.687 --> 17:54.880
Dangerous business.

17:54.980 --> 17:56.548
- You want to help?
- Yeah, sure.

17:56.648 --> 17:57.949
Here, hold him.

17:58.442 --> 18:00.335
Sherlock, you hold that.

19:59.980 --> 20:01.339
- Did you get it?
- Yeah.

20:01.439 --> 20:03.508
Just like taking candy away from a baby.

20:03.608 --> 20:05.660
Well, let's split it here.

20:13.201 --> 20:15.270
Look at those two guys
cutting up all that money.

20:15.370 --> 20:16.855
Probably robbed a bank.

20:16.955 --> 20:18.677
They must be the two.

20:19.124 --> 20:21.193
- Hey, Chief?
- Yeah?

20:21.293 --> 20:22.936
Your slip's showing.

20:24.588 --> 20:27.266
Oh, drop in for a little
excitement, Sheriff?

20:27.465 --> 20:28.617
Yeah, it looks like it.

20:28.717 --> 20:31.078
A hundred for me and 50 for you.

20:31.178 --> 20:33.276
Yeah, that's alright, but remember...

20:33.388 --> 20:36.567
I win the championship back tomorrow night.

20:36.808 --> 20:38.109
Oh, that's ok.

20:42.606 --> 20:44.174
Where'd you get all that money?

20:44.274 --> 20:45.717
We got paid, see?

20:45.817 --> 20:46.760
For wrestling.

20:46.860 --> 20:48.707
You mean you held up a bank.

20:50.947 --> 20:52.590
You're under arrest!

20:55.911 --> 20:59.272
Get your hands off me
or I'll punch you right in the nose.

20:59.372 --> 21:01.049
Oh yeah?

21:04.544 --> 21:05.845
Just a minute.

21:16.640 --> 21:17.941
Por Que pasa?

22:18.493 --> 22:20.466
Sherlock, come back here!

22:21.246 --> 22:23.389
Please be careful of my china!

22:25.542 --> 22:27.685
Horatio, they're breaking up the joint!

22:29.671 --> 22:31.063
What? You again?

22:34.175 --> 22:35.476
Hey, Chief!

22:36.011 --> 22:36.995
Chief!

22:37.095 --> 22:40.540
Those guys, they're wrestlers!
They are not fighters!

22:40.640 --> 22:42.237
- Wrestlers?
- You know?

22:44.352 --> 22:45.653
Stand back.

22:46.062 --> 22:48.160
So, you want to wrestle, huh?

22:49.691 --> 22:50.992
Help!

26:21.945 --> 26:23.246
Easy, boy.

26:27.575 --> 26:28.876
C'mon, fella.

26:38.586 --> 26:39.887
Sherlock!

26:41.756 --> 26:44.284
Take it easy with him, Tad.
He's hurt pretty badly.

26:44.384 --> 26:45.452
Dixie.

26:45.552 --> 26:47.162
Run and get the veterinarian.

26:47.262 --> 26:49.360
- Tell him to hurry.
- Yeah sure, Roy.

27:00.316 --> 27:02.051
Are you responsible for this!

27:02.151 --> 27:04.345
Now, look, I ain't done nothing.

27:04.445 --> 27:06.097
You got nothing to hold me on.

27:06.197 --> 27:09.476
Nothing except shooting at me
and trying to kill Sherlock.

27:09.576 --> 27:11.276
He and his partner
slipped out of the cantina

27:11.376 --> 27:12.437
when the fight was going on.

27:12.537 --> 27:14.965
Got nothing to hold you on, huh?

27:16.457 --> 27:18.309
What are you running from?

27:19.377 --> 27:21.946
I just don't like trouble, that's all.

27:22.046 --> 27:24.144
We'll find out who you are.

27:24.299 --> 27:25.942
Where you came from.

27:26.718 --> 27:29.112
He may have something to do
with these train wrecks.

27:29.679 --> 27:32.983
If that dog dies, you
better hide these keys.

27:33.099 --> 27:35.527
Keep me from busting into his cell.

27:35.685 --> 27:36.920
Say. Tad?

27:37.020 --> 27:38.671
When you found that train...

27:38.771 --> 27:41.299
did you pick up anything that
might help solve these murders?

27:41.399 --> 27:42.467
Not a thing.

27:42.567 --> 27:45.553
Just a lot of spilt milk
and produce thrown all around.

27:45.653 --> 27:48.765
They must've unloaded the produce
to make room for something else.

27:48.865 --> 27:50.850
But, Roy, the cars were all
empty when we found the

27:50.950 --> 27:53.344
wreckage at the end of the
other end of the line.

27:55.872 --> 27:57.173
Mr. Rogers?

27:57.707 --> 27:59.008
Yeah?

27:59.584 --> 28:02.362
I came over to tell you we were
ready to pick up your cattle.

28:02.462 --> 28:04.864
The train will be down at the
loading pins in a couple of hours.

28:04.964 --> 28:08.108
All right. I'll round up my boys and
be there to help get them aboard.

28:08.760 --> 28:10.277
See ya later, Tad.

28:36.110 --> 28:37.113
Que pasa?

28:37.213 --> 28:38.458
All right, Felicia,
I'll take care of it.

28:38.559 --> 28:39.615
Tell my guests I'll be right in.

28:39.715 --> 28:40.716
Si, Señor.

28:42.126 --> 28:44.654
I came over to tell you that Rogers
is working with the Sheriff again.

28:44.754 --> 28:47.615
Yes, I know. But, he won't be here long.
He's in the cattle business.

28:47.715 --> 28:50.234
I'm going to show you
a copy of a telegram he sent.

28:50.718 --> 28:53.496
Oh, so he's going to stay
in border town, eh?

28:53.596 --> 28:55.373
You better watch it, Mr. McKnight.

28:55.473 --> 28:59.198
- He's plenty smart.
- Good boy, Blinky. Come on in.

28:59.769 --> 29:01.254
Señor McKnight will be right here.

29:01.354 --> 29:03.965
Oh, I suppose nobody minds
my looking at these guns, huh?

29:04.065 --> 29:05.235
Oh no, Señor.

29:05.336 --> 29:07.343
He's always so proud
to show them.

29:07.443 --> 29:09.637
That one is what you call
a pepper pot.

29:09.737 --> 29:11.806
I think it could pepper
you pretty good, huh?

29:11.906 --> 29:13.975
That was very popular
in the 17th century.

29:14.075 --> 29:16.142
That is if you don't mind me
giving the two dollar lecture

29:16.243 --> 29:17.245
that goes with the guns?

29:17.345 --> 29:19.146
- Pardon, Señor.
- That's alright, Felicia.

29:19.247 --> 29:20.940
Just close the door and see
we're not disturbed.

29:21.040 --> 29:22.942
Si, Señor, and
I'll guard it with my life.

29:23.042 --> 29:24.819
You got enough guns here
to start our own war.

29:24.919 --> 29:27.989
I'm afraid we'd lose.
These guns are a little out of date.

29:28.089 --> 29:30.074
I suppose you know
my brother's in jail.

29:30.174 --> 29:32.660
Well, there's no charge against him.
No one knows who he is.

29:32.760 --> 29:34.871
I doubt if they'll connect
him with the gun running.

29:34.971 --> 29:36.539
What do you mean?
You going to leave him there?

29:36.639 --> 29:39.417
I know a little something about the law.
They'll hold him on an open charge for

29:39.517 --> 29:41.836
24 hours, then they'll have to release him.

29:41.936 --> 29:44.380
Yeah, I guess that's smarter
than trying to spring him.

29:44.480 --> 29:48.000
That was my thought, but
not my words precisely.

29:48.109 --> 29:49.661
How about the guns.

29:50.445 --> 29:53.348
We picked them up in the Middle West
over half a million dollars worth.

29:53.448 --> 29:55.642
Have that refrigerator, Carl,
on the siding tonight.

29:55.742 --> 29:57.518
What about the vegetables and things in it?

29:57.618 --> 30:00.480
We'll can 'em away. Don't worry about it.

30:00.580 --> 30:01.881
It'll be there.

30:09.756 --> 30:11.824
Hey, Splinters. I'll talk to
the engineer and have him

30:11.924 --> 30:14.160
let us off at that wrecked
train so we can look it over.

30:14.260 --> 30:16.858
Foy, you and the boys load
your horses on that empty car.

30:16.971 --> 30:19.707
We'll need some transportation home.
Look after Trigger for me, will ya?

30:19.807 --> 30:21.984
I'll see he gets water, Roy.

30:45.792 --> 30:47.568
What's the matter Splinter?
You got the hiccups, again?

30:47.668 --> 30:49.153
Yeah, I guess I'm a little excited.

30:49.253 --> 30:51.698
I got just the cure for it.
Try standing on your head.

30:51.798 --> 30:53.950
You have just the head for it, too.

30:54.050 --> 30:57.229
I never heard of that cure,
but I'll try anything.

33:20.029 --> 33:22.306
This is sure a lonesome stretch of track.

33:22.406 --> 33:24.517
Yeah, the nearest road's ten miles away.

33:24.617 --> 33:28.217
Hey, it looks like Splinters is
about to get rid of his hiccups!

33:41.175 --> 33:42.977
Hey, it worked!

33:43.260 --> 33:45.938
Sure felt nice and cool there for a minute.

33:49.433 --> 33:51.127
Oh, we're coming to the wreck.

33:51.227 --> 33:53.074
You boys get the horses up.

34:17.168 --> 34:18.362
Hi, Dixie.

34:18.462 --> 34:20.447
How's Sherlock coming along?

34:20.547 --> 34:21.616
We don't know yet.

34:21.716 --> 34:23.784
Doc Jones can't tell us anything.

34:23.884 --> 34:25.731
He's afraid to operate.

34:28.723 --> 34:29.956
Hi, Sheriff.

34:30.056 --> 34:31.292
Did you find out who he is, yet?

34:31.391 --> 34:35.295
Yeah, says his name is John Smith.

34:35.396 --> 34:36.697
John Smith?

34:36.897 --> 34:39.425
Oh, that'd make his partner Pocahontas.

34:39.525 --> 34:41.668
Yeah, that's right.

34:44.655 --> 34:45.815
Sheriff?

34:46.114 --> 34:47.712
What do you think that is?

34:48.951 --> 34:50.252
It's grease.

34:50.870 --> 34:52.396
Got a lot of graphite in it.

34:52.496 --> 34:54.264
Probably off a train.

34:54.373 --> 34:55.733
I don't think so.

34:55.833 --> 34:58.986
Looks like that grease they pack
guns in to keep 'em from rusting.

34:59.086 --> 34:59.987
Look.

35:00.087 --> 35:03.106
I think those are
serial numbers from guns.

35:03.382 --> 35:05.480
1626.

35:06.218 --> 35:08.316
There's ten rifles in a case.

35:12.308 --> 35:13.609
Gun runners.

35:13.768 --> 35:15.069
Yeah.

35:15.436 --> 35:18.422
That's why they emptied those cars.
To make room for the guns.

35:18.522 --> 35:20.967
But, why would they put
the guns in the train?

35:21.067 --> 35:23.665
It's the only way they can get 'em
to that lonely stretch of beach.

35:26.447 --> 35:29.091
Sheriff's office. Osborne speaking.

35:30.493 --> 35:31.919
It's Judge Reedy.

35:33.245 --> 35:34.438
Listen, Tad.

35:34.538 --> 35:35.580
You've got a prisoner there,

35:35.681 --> 35:37.233
but you're not going
to be able to hold him.

35:37.333 --> 35:39.777
I just signed a court order
releasing him.

35:39.877 --> 35:41.599
- Stall him.
- Yeah.

35:41.837 --> 35:44.310
Uh, Judge, can you hold it up a while?

35:44.548 --> 35:45.974
Can't do it, Tad.

35:46.175 --> 35:50.480
I set bail for $5,000 and it came up.
Cash on the barrel head.

35:51.263 --> 35:52.748
Who put it up, Judge?

35:52.848 --> 35:54.458
Wouldn't do any good to tell ya.

35:54.558 --> 35:56.210
He'll be there in three minutes.

35:57.353 --> 36:00.247
Oh, alright Judge, I'll do as you say.

36:02.505 --> 36:03.509
Three minutes.

36:03.609 --> 36:04.635
Three minutes?

36:04.735 --> 36:07.129
That doesn't give us much time.

36:07.279 --> 36:10.182
Somebody sure is anxious to get
that prisoner out of there.

36:10.282 --> 36:13.256
At least we're going to find out
who's putting up the money.

36:14.370 --> 36:15.813
What are you doing, Dixie?

36:15.913 --> 36:18.716
Well, we want to find out who
the prisoner is, don't we?

36:21.544 --> 36:23.687
Hey, that's a pretty good idea.

36:25.923 --> 36:28.317
No, this guy's too good looking.

36:30.427 --> 36:32.821
Give me one that looks like an Airedale.

36:34.306 --> 36:36.529
You know, I studied art once.

36:37.143 --> 36:40.004
Oh, those models. But, I had to give it up.

36:40.104 --> 36:42.623
- I couldn't keep my mind on my work.
- I couldn't keep my mind on my work.

36:43.691 --> 36:46.085
Hey, maybe Dixie's got an idea.

36:46.402 --> 36:48.471
Only we can use it in reverse.

36:48.571 --> 36:49.597
Use your keys.

36:49.697 --> 36:50.973
Now what?

36:51.073 --> 36:53.876
Let's see what he looks like
with those whiskers off.

36:54.368 --> 36:56.812
C'mon, Splinters. You've got a
customer who wants a shave.

36:56.912 --> 36:58.814
Oh, this is going to be
a real pleasure.

36:58.914 --> 37:00.517
You can't take me outta here.

37:00.618 --> 37:02.224
Not until I'm bailed out!

37:04.170 --> 37:07.144
Now, don't worry.
I'm the best barber in East Park.

37:07.381 --> 37:09.200
You can't do this! It ain't legal!

37:09.300 --> 37:12.399
Yeah, and neither is pistol
whipping a hound dog.

37:13.721 --> 37:15.998
Sheriff, who ever's bringing
that court order, stall 'em.

37:16.098 --> 37:17.374
- We'll need a little more time.
- All right.

37:17.474 --> 37:18.775
C'mon, boys.

37:36.452 --> 37:37.753
Here, get busy.

37:37.995 --> 37:39.296
Oh, yeah.

37:57.014 --> 38:00.944
Jesus, Sheriff, get up!

38:38.931 --> 38:40.325
Viva, viva! Bravo, Señorita.

38:40.426 --> 38:41.959
Come to my cantina,
we'll give you a job.

38:42.059 --> 38:44.920
- Now, Sheriff, let's get down to business.
- Here, have a cigar.

38:45.020 --> 38:46.788
Oh, gracias, Señorita.

38:46.981 --> 38:50.342
Nick has big surprise for you.
Going to have a coming out party.

38:50.442 --> 38:51.677
Coming out of where?

38:51.777 --> 38:54.889
Coming out from the cell,
like cuckoo from the cocoons.

38:54.989 --> 38:56.265
Taking off like...

38:56.365 --> 38:57.665
butterflies.

38:59.159 --> 39:00.881
Eh, court order, huh?

39:01.287 --> 39:02.563
That looks legal, alright.

39:02.663 --> 39:04.356
I'll have him out for you in a half hour.

39:04.456 --> 39:06.442
What's the... what's the matter with you?
Can't you read?

39:06.542 --> 39:09.516
The paper says
"immediate release." Now!

39:09.628 --> 39:13.182
O.K., kid. I got the fix
for you to fly the coop.

39:19.722 --> 39:23.447
So, the butterfly take a
bothersome place, huh?

39:24.310 --> 39:25.836
What you do with him?
He was here a few minutes

39:25.936 --> 39:28.159
ago when the judge called here.
Where is he?

39:29.481 --> 39:30.907
Yeah, he is gone.

39:31.525 --> 39:32.801
How about that.

39:32.901 --> 39:33.969
Jail break.

39:34.069 --> 39:35.763
Right under your nose.

39:35.863 --> 39:37.681
Another blot on your record, Sheriff.

39:37.781 --> 39:38.988
Jail break.

39:40.242 --> 39:42.465
Who you think you're kidding?

39:42.995 --> 39:44.230
You hiding him.

39:44.330 --> 39:46.565
We fine the prison,
you release him to me.

39:46.665 --> 39:49.969
If we turn this town
upside down on its head!

39:56.091 --> 39:59.495
There's one thing I can't stand,
it's a fella going around without shaving.

39:59.595 --> 40:01.243
You get the idea
he's hiding from something...

40:01.343 --> 40:02.348
Listen you!

40:02.448 --> 40:03.958
And he doesn't want honest folks
to recognize him.

40:04.258 --> 40:05.359
I...

40:12.179 --> 40:13.179
What do you know!

40:13.281 --> 40:16.270
I'm going to break a shaving
speed record on this guy!

40:18.489 --> 40:19.723
Watch it!
Take it easy, Splinter!

40:19.823 --> 40:21.412
Oh, now, don't worry, fellas.

40:21.513 --> 40:23.568
I'm going to wait
until the next hiccup.

40:25.037 --> 40:27.106
I'll be back in this town.
You'll pay for this!

40:27.206 --> 40:29.149
Any last words before the next hiccup?

40:29.249 --> 40:30.651
You missed him, Splinters!

40:30.751 --> 40:32.598
I did?
Shake your head.

40:34.088 --> 40:36.365
- Hey, wait a minute!
- I'm not through, yet!

40:36.465 --> 40:39.518
Listen, let me out of here! I'm a
private citizen, I know my rights!

40:40.052 --> 40:41.537
Let me go, do ya hear?

40:41.637 --> 40:43.122
There, anybody recognize him?

40:43.222 --> 40:45.165
- No, I've never seen him.
- You, Roy?

40:45.265 --> 40:46.557
No, not yet.

40:46.767 --> 40:47.861
Let this man go.

40:47.962 --> 40:49.795
He's not from the calabus,
release on bail!

40:49.895 --> 40:51.196
That's right.

40:51.355 --> 40:53.650
Nick put up the bail money.
$5,000.

40:53.751 --> 40:55.560
Judge Reedy signed the order.

40:56.819 --> 40:58.971
You haven't heard
the last of this, Rogers.

40:59.071 --> 41:00.372
I'll be back.

41:00.572 --> 41:03.091
Always like a satisfied customer.

41:05.869 --> 41:08.188
Put your guns on the floor
and get in the back room!

41:08.288 --> 41:10.261
You better do it, fellas.

41:16.088 --> 41:17.480
Not you, Rogers.

41:17.881 --> 41:19.199
You're coming with me.

41:19.299 --> 41:20.942
Nick, lock the door.

41:26.348 --> 41:27.549
C'mon!

42:25.866 --> 42:28.690
Turn around and go back
where you come from!

42:32.830 --> 42:33.830
What will we do?

42:33.930 --> 42:34.930
We can't do anything.

42:35.040 --> 42:36.240
If we shoot now,
we'll hit Roy.

42:36.340 --> 42:37.640
If we don't hit him,
Kimball will.

42:37.794 --> 42:39.220
We going on back.

42:49.640 --> 42:53.365
Looks like your friends
think a lot of you, Rogers.

42:59.358 --> 43:03.208
Five grand on the line to bail me out,
and you don't even know me.

43:03.445 --> 43:05.597
I'm still trying to figure
that one out.

43:05.697 --> 43:07.599
That's pin money, chicken's feet.

43:07.699 --> 43:09.351
You want to make a deal for guns?

43:09.451 --> 43:10.978
Nick Corella's your man.

43:11.078 --> 43:16.179
Ok, ok, when it's dark I'll let
you talk to a couple of friends of mine.

43:27.386 --> 43:28.996
- C'mon, let's go!
- Wait a minute, Splinters.

43:29.096 --> 43:32.149
We can't just stand here.
They'll get to big a start on us.

43:32.391 --> 43:34.113
Nobody's stopping me!

43:36.728 --> 43:38.922
You want to endanger Roy's life?

43:39.022 --> 43:40.574
Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.

43:41.113 --> 43:42.020
It's getting dark.

43:42.120 --> 43:43.635
We'll never be able
to trail them at night.

43:43.735 --> 43:46.129
Well, we'll do the best we can.

44:00.669 --> 44:01.970
Take cover.

44:14.516 --> 44:15.876
Hey, Johnny!

44:15.976 --> 44:17.277
Hiya, Walt.

44:17.853 --> 44:19.154
It's ok

44:24.443 --> 44:26.428
I hope you didn't miss me.

44:26.528 --> 44:27.513
How'd you get out?

44:27.613 --> 44:31.258
I got friends. Nick sprung me.
He didn't let me sit there.

44:31.700 --> 44:33.616
I suppose you know
there's a government post

44:33.717 --> 44:34.811
out on us for smuggling.

44:34.911 --> 44:37.481
No, I didn't know that.
Oh, that's why he's here, huh?

44:37.581 --> 44:41.151
Yeah, recognize me from the poster
after shaving off my beard.

44:41.251 --> 44:44.054
Yeah, well put it back on.
You look better.

44:44.212 --> 44:45.864
How did you cut in on this deal?

44:45.964 --> 44:47.783
Well, I find out we are
all in the same business.

44:47.883 --> 44:49.409
If we are partners, we
make lots of money.

44:49.509 --> 44:50.577
You got good merchandise.

44:50.677 --> 44:52.371
Yeah, we don't need any new partners.

44:52.471 --> 44:54.569
What do you want
to talk like that for?

44:54.931 --> 44:57.167
I got connections.
Good ones.

44:57.267 --> 44:58.669
I got money to spend for guns.

44:58.769 --> 45:00.837
We're supposed to take
your word for that, huh?

45:00.937 --> 45:04.036
Well, I take your word for things, too.
Got your brother out of jail tonight.

45:04.524 --> 45:07.386
You tell me about the guns, we could've
worked together a long time ago.

45:07.486 --> 45:10.414
I don't like this. Let's take
him around to see the boss.

45:11.490 --> 45:14.213
As soon as you're finished, reseal
the doors and clear out of here.

45:34.846 --> 45:36.957
Just how long ago did he
ask you to send this?

45:37.057 --> 45:38.950
Oh, about two hours ago.

45:39.142 --> 45:42.629
You know, that singer that works in
this place brought it over. Carmelita.

45:42.729 --> 45:44.155
You know the one.

45:54.616 --> 45:55.917
Wait here.

46:03.041 --> 46:06.390
Things don't look so good for you, Rogers.
You're in a tough spot.

46:06.503 --> 46:09.477
Don't look like you get out of this one.

46:10.966 --> 46:13.394
You know what they plan for you.

46:17.180 --> 46:19.278
Don't tell me, I can guess.

46:22.185 --> 46:23.211
C'mon in, Nick.

46:23.311 --> 46:24.612
Ok, ok

46:33.363 --> 46:34.931
Ah, Señor McKnight!

46:35.031 --> 46:38.060
Hello, Nick. I was just going to send
for you. This saves me the trouble.

46:38.160 --> 46:40.020
Well, you want to see me, huh?

46:40.120 --> 46:42.105
Kimball just told that you
want to cut in on our deal.

46:42.205 --> 46:44.107
- That's right.
- Yeah?

46:44.207 --> 46:46.276
Well, sit down, Nick. I want
to ask you a few questions.

46:46.376 --> 46:48.820
Si, seguro, ask me any
questions you want to know.

46:48.920 --> 46:50.030
Tell me, Nick.

46:50.130 --> 46:51.907
How long have you had the cantina?

46:52.007 --> 46:54.826
Oh, about five, six weeks.

46:54.926 --> 46:56.286
Who are you working for?

46:56.386 --> 46:59.081
Me? I work for Nick Corella.

46:59.181 --> 47:02.280
But, there's not big money in cantina.

47:02.893 --> 47:05.116
You sent this telegram, Nick.

47:05.562 --> 47:07.547
Too bad you had to make
a mistake like that.

47:07.647 --> 47:10.634
Mistake? This is a mistake.
That's to my brother.

47:10.734 --> 47:12.035
Oh no it isn't.

47:12.861 --> 47:15.038
Careless for a federal agent.

47:18.408 --> 47:19.960
That's a good joke!

47:20.160 --> 47:22.679
Nick Corella work for government!

47:23.038 --> 47:25.011
This telegram is in code.

47:25.749 --> 47:28.402
You arranged it so Walter Kimball
would have to be released on bail.

47:28.502 --> 47:32.239
Now, no one but a government man
could've done that in so short a time.

47:32.339 --> 47:35.563
You made it appear that this
message was to your brother.

47:35.717 --> 47:38.611
But, you see, we're very
well organized, Nick.

47:38.720 --> 47:41.273
Even to the man who routes our trains.

47:42.224 --> 47:46.779
The government's been looking for the
head of the gun runners for a long time.

47:46.895 --> 47:49.323
And now one of its agents knows.

47:49.940 --> 47:52.584
But, you won't be able to tell anybody.

47:52.776 --> 47:55.499
This is the end of the road for you.

47:57.155 --> 47:58.849
That won't help you any, McKnight.

47:58.949 --> 48:00.016
If anything happens to me,
there'll be government

48:00.116 --> 48:02.352
agents swarming all over here
inside of an hour.

48:02.452 --> 48:05.801
I'm gambling it won't happen
quite that soon.

48:20.262 --> 48:23.749
You know, this hasn't killed a man
since the days of Napoleon.

48:23.849 --> 48:25.292
What are you going to do with Rogers?

48:25.392 --> 48:26.693
What can we do?

48:26.852 --> 48:28.404
The same treatment.

48:28.562 --> 48:29.880
I'll get rid of Nick.

48:29.980 --> 48:33.033
- You and Walt take care of Rogers.
- Ok

48:36.319 --> 48:38.246
- Nick.
- Yeah.

48:40.824 --> 48:42.125
Yeah.

48:43.743 --> 48:45.044
C'mon, Rogers.

49:28.997 --> 49:32.221
Well, this looks like it ought
to be a good spot, huh?

49:32.375 --> 49:34.598
C'mon, Rogers, keep walking.

49:35.211 --> 49:37.104
Yeah, it is a good spot.

49:37.213 --> 49:40.158
All right, Rogers, what's the matter?
You afraid of walking off a cliff?

49:40.258 --> 49:42.526
Might be your last step.

50:49.327 --> 50:52.506
Oh, it's a cinch we can't
follow him into town.

50:59.254 --> 51:00.555
It's Roy!

51:01.965 --> 51:04.451
- Tad, where are the boys?
- Well, they're all out looking for you.

51:04.551 --> 51:06.124
Dixie, run over to the cantina

51:06.225 --> 51:08.496
and if Nick Corella shows up,
bring him back here.

51:08.596 --> 51:09.996
He just did me a big favor.

51:10.096 --> 51:11.115
Where'd they take you, Roy?

51:11.216 --> 51:12.751
I'll get a posse together
and we'll go out and...

51:12.851 --> 51:14.127
Wait a minute, Tad.

51:14.227 --> 51:15.795
I can't tell you
where they took me.

51:15.895 --> 51:17.788
They had me blindfolded.

51:28.783 --> 51:30.481
C'mon, you gotta get up.

51:31.327 --> 51:32.723
Oh, I know it hurts.

51:32.824 --> 51:35.197
Yes, that's all now.
C'mon, boy.

51:35.457 --> 51:37.100
That's alright, boy.

51:37.375 --> 51:40.362
C'mon now, we're going for a walk.
That's a boy.

51:40.462 --> 51:42.139
That's a boy.

51:47.677 --> 51:49.162
You've got Sherlock.

51:49.262 --> 51:50.563
Yeah.

51:50.805 --> 51:52.448
Doc Jones just left.

51:53.475 --> 51:56.028
Says he can't do anything for him.

51:56.519 --> 51:59.368
Wants me to put him out of his misery.

52:06.613 --> 52:09.211
Guess I might as well get it over with.

52:09.491 --> 52:11.259
C'mon, old timer.

52:17.165 --> 52:19.859
Did you hear the citizen's committee
wants to call in the militia?

52:19.959 --> 52:21.111
Yeah.

52:21.211 --> 52:22.779
All we need's a little more time.

52:22.879 --> 52:26.683
With election day tomorrow
it sure looks bad for Tad.

52:32.722 --> 52:34.374
Hey, I wonder where Sherlock is?

52:34.474 --> 52:35.775
Tad!

52:35.975 --> 52:36.876
Roy!

52:36.976 --> 52:39.170
Uncle Tad just left to put
Sherlock out of his misery.

52:39.270 --> 52:40.964
- Well, you should've stopped him.
- I tried to, but I...

52:41.064 --> 52:42.365
C'mon.

52:55.245 --> 52:58.845
Oughta be some good hunting here, boy.

53:08.591 --> 53:11.895
Only that's the tree that
I spent the night under.

53:12.178 --> 53:14.230
The time my leg was broke.

53:14.430 --> 53:17.074
Chasing those two escaped convicts.

53:17.851 --> 53:19.152
Yeah.

53:20.145 --> 53:22.322
I'd still be there, I guess.

53:22.730 --> 53:24.031
My bones would.

53:24.357 --> 53:27.410
If you hadn't gone
barking and yelping.

53:28.069 --> 53:30.121
The folks came to help me.

54:09.444 --> 54:11.805
Uncle Tad, why couldn't you have waited?

54:11.905 --> 54:13.098
You mean that shot?

54:13.198 --> 54:16.217
I saw you ride up. I was just
trying to call you over.

54:16.409 --> 54:17.710
Sherlock.

54:19.495 --> 54:21.593
Uncle Tad you didn't.

54:22.832 --> 54:24.429
No, I couldn't.

54:24.584 --> 54:26.152
Did you say you were trying
to get our attention?

54:26.252 --> 54:28.029
Yeah, Sherlock found a body.

54:28.129 --> 54:29.430
Nick Corella.

54:29.964 --> 54:32.016
Don't touch anything, Roy.

54:32.508 --> 54:34.202
Dead about 24 hours.

54:34.302 --> 54:35.703
Shot in the back.

54:35.803 --> 54:38.206
His body was brought here
after he was killed.

54:38.306 --> 54:40.208
I'll send the coroner out from town.

54:40.308 --> 54:43.128
Splinters, you stay here with the body.
Don't let anybody touch anything.

54:43.228 --> 54:44.529
C'mon, Dixie.

54:45.396 --> 54:46.840
Hey, hey, Sherlock.

54:46.940 --> 54:49.092
You stay here with me and keep me company.

54:49.192 --> 54:52.595
Why, getting back into action is the
best thing that ever happened to you.

54:52.695 --> 54:55.265
You're not going to let
anybody get near that body.

54:55.365 --> 54:56.599
Not even me.

54:56.699 --> 54:58.000
Are we?

54:58.576 --> 54:59.877
Yeah.

55:03.915 --> 55:05.942
Now that Rogers knows who you are...

55:06.042 --> 55:08.194
and with a federal man missing...

55:08.294 --> 55:11.447
this town will be swarming with
government men by tomorrow night.

55:11.547 --> 55:15.285
I'll make the contact. We'll run
those guns as soon as possible.

55:15.385 --> 55:17.107
Then we'll clear out.

55:17.553 --> 55:22.458
Get in touch with Blinky and have him send
an engine to pick up that refrigerator car.

55:22.558 --> 55:25.587
Nick left this for you in case
something happened to him.

55:25.687 --> 55:27.964
The last time I saw him
was yesterday when he

55:28.064 --> 55:30.833
told me to send a telegram
to him at the dipper.

55:31.943 --> 55:34.721
He was working for the government, Roy.

55:34.821 --> 55:36.848
That's why he slipped me that knife.

55:36.948 --> 55:39.642
It also explains why he
got Kimball out of jail.

55:39.742 --> 55:41.510
So he could trail him.

55:42.245 --> 55:45.815
"If my plans miss, this message
will be placed in your hands."

55:45.915 --> 55:48.151
"The enclosed identification will explain."

55:48.251 --> 55:51.654
"Please notify the Department
of Justice immediately. Nick."

55:51.754 --> 55:54.365
Do you think you can find out
who killed him, Sheriff?

55:54.465 --> 55:56.659
If I don't, the next Sheriff will.

55:56.759 --> 55:58.453
Hey Roy, this is something.

55:58.553 --> 56:01.122
I waited at the coroner's office
like you said.

56:01.222 --> 56:03.945
There's the bullet that killed Nick.

56:05.310 --> 56:07.795
This is from an old-type muzzle loader.

56:07.895 --> 56:09.589
Must be over a hundred years old.

56:09.689 --> 56:11.799
Wonder who'd own a gun like that?

56:11.899 --> 56:13.384
I don't know, Roy.

56:13.484 --> 56:15.970
The only gun collector around
here that I know is McKnight.

56:16.070 --> 56:16.971
McKnight?

56:17.071 --> 56:18.223
Yeah.

56:18.323 --> 56:20.058
Let's go and have a little talk with him.

56:20.158 --> 56:22.185
Splinters. Round up the boys.

56:22.285 --> 56:25.313
We'll go over and see if McKnight
owns a gun that'll match this bullet.

56:25.413 --> 56:28.262
- See ya later, Carmelita.
- Ok, Roy.

56:44.599 --> 56:46.668
- Buenos Dias, Sheriff.
- Where's McKnight?

56:46.768 --> 56:49.321
- He's not here. He's gone.
- Yeah?

56:57.737 --> 56:59.438
This is the gun room
I was telling you about.

56:59.539 --> 57:00.890
He's very proud of his collection.

57:00.990 --> 57:02.058
Quite an arsenal.

57:02.158 --> 57:04.310
We better see
if we can find that gun.

57:04.410 --> 57:05.853
Hey, here's an old one.

57:05.953 --> 57:08.426
I'll bet this thing hasn't been
fired in over a hundred...

57:12.460 --> 57:13.987
You know, on him it looks good.

57:14.087 --> 57:15.388
Definitely.

57:25.640 --> 57:26.791
Hey!

57:26.891 --> 57:28.793
When I was blindfolded last night

57:28.893 --> 57:32.538
I heard a bird chirp right
after the shot that killed Nick.

57:36.567 --> 57:38.119
I been here before.

57:38.486 --> 57:41.306
McKnight knew Nick was a
government agent and he killed him.

57:41.406 --> 57:43.933
But, how could he know that?
Nick didn't even tell me.

57:44.033 --> 57:46.394
That telegram Carmelita sent for Nick...

57:46.494 --> 57:48.021
never went through.

57:48.121 --> 57:50.315
It must've been stopped at the depot.

57:50.415 --> 57:51.941
But, had it gone through...

57:52.041 --> 57:54.986
the government agents would
have contacted us by now.

57:55.086 --> 57:56.808
Let's pick up Blinky-

58:01.342 --> 58:04.691
Hey, Tim, you better stick around and
pick up McKnight when he comes back.

58:34.292 --> 58:35.593
Hold it, Elroy.

58:39.505 --> 58:41.866
- Rogers and the sheriff are at my place.
- Oh, they are, huh?

58:41.966 --> 58:43.659
Well, we better get moving.
There's over a half million

58:43.759 --> 58:45.828
dollars worth of guns and
ammunition riding in that car.

58:45.928 --> 58:47.288
And I don't want to get
caught and strung up

58:47.388 --> 58:49.235
in this crummy town. Not
even for you, McKnight.

59:11.537 --> 59:14.774
Well, I've done my share, Mr. McKnight.
I'll see you for my cut later.

59:14.874 --> 59:16.668
Wait a minute, Blinky.
This is our last run,

59:16.769 --> 59:18.111
you'd be better off
staying with us.

59:18.211 --> 59:19.715
Get this thing rolling.

59:44.904 --> 59:47.098
Spread out and search the town.
See if you can pick up Blinky.

59:47.198 --> 59:48.875
We'll wait here for him.

59:56.374 --> 59:57.483
That's funny.

59:57.583 --> 01:00:00.386
There's no train leaving here
'til five o'clock tonight.

01:00:00.628 --> 01:00:02.822
If that was a scheduled
train, it'd be on that board.

01:00:02.922 --> 01:00:04.157
We'll have to check up on that.

01:00:04.257 --> 01:00:06.492
But, there's no road along the
track 'til Willett Crossing.

01:00:06.592 --> 01:00:08.940
- We'll form a posse.
- I'll meet you back here.

01:00:50.970 --> 01:00:54.114
Slow down at the next turn. The
boats will be waiting there.

01:01:16.078 --> 01:01:18.314
Get the guns in those boats. Hurry!

01:01:18.414 --> 01:01:20.842
C'mon, Blinky, you can help 'em.

01:01:47.777 --> 01:01:48.678
- McKnight?
- Yes.

01:01:48.778 --> 01:01:50.763
I've got a message for
you from the captain.

01:01:50.863 --> 01:01:53.307
He says he's afraid to bring the
ship in any closer than ten miles.

01:01:53.407 --> 01:01:56.561
Well, I can't says I blame him. This
is the last shipment for some time.

01:01:56.661 --> 01:01:58.563
We've got to find a new contact point.

01:01:58.663 --> 01:02:00.731
Tell him he'll hear from me in a few days.

01:02:00.831 --> 01:02:03.099
C'mon boys,
you can help with the guns.
