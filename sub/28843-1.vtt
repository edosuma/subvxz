00:32.433 --> 00:33.699
Professor!

00:34.602 --> 00:36.368
<i> Jesus, Sanjay,</i>
<i>it's like 3...</i>

00:36.370 --> 00:39.238
They miscataloged it! They
didn't know what they had.

00:39.240 --> 00:41.306
<i>Can we just-- Can we
talk in the morning?</i>

00:41.308 --> 00:44.376
The Hermopolis dig,
my requisition went through.

00:44.378 --> 00:46.211
I have <i> The Alchemical Manuscript</i>

00:46.213 --> 00:48.480
of the cult of
Hermes Trismegistus.

00:48.482 --> 00:50.282
<i>- Good Christ!</i>
- It's ours, professor.

00:50.284 --> 00:52.051
They
thought I was asking

00:52.053 --> 00:53.652
for some old grave robber's
journal or something.

00:53.654 --> 00:55.154
<i>I'm on my way.</i>

00:55.156 --> 00:57.322
I can't wait to
see what they say

00:57.324 --> 01:00.259
when Ellen and Osama outshine
the rest of the department.

01:01.462 --> 01:02.694
Us against the world, right?

01:02.696 --> 01:05.129
<i>- Always. I'll see you soon.</i>
- Okay.

01:37.765 --> 01:39.131
Professor!

01:42.503 --> 01:44.503
Hello? Professor?

01:52.346 --> 01:55.514
What the fuck? Where did it go?

01:55.516 --> 01:56.715
What?

01:56.717 --> 01:57.883
No, no, no, no, no.

02:20.441 --> 02:21.673
What the--

02:23.444 --> 02:25.177
How did that get--

02:43.264 --> 02:45.197
Sanjay? It's Sam.

02:51.338 --> 02:52.404
Sanjay?

02:52.406 --> 02:53.739
Are you here?

03:18.399 --> 03:19.598
Sanjay?

03:39.353 --> 03:40.652
Professor Rand.

03:42.456 --> 03:44.957
Ha. You can't be serious.

03:44.959 --> 03:48.293
No foul play? Are
you blind? Did--

03:50.664 --> 03:53.298
Yes, yes, I'm calm.

03:54.335 --> 03:56.802
Listen, he didn't just
get up and run off

03:56.804 --> 03:58.737
in the 20 minutes
it took me to--

03:59.640 --> 04:00.872
What about his phone?

04:03.310 --> 04:04.843
Mm-hm.

04:04.845 --> 04:05.911
Mm-hm.

04:10.317 --> 04:12.584
Okay, fine.

04:12.586 --> 04:14.286
Case closed.

04:14.288 --> 04:16.988
God forbid you do any
actual fucking police work.

06:21.982 --> 06:23.298
Yeah?

06:23.299 --> 06:24.615
What the hell are you
doing here, Rand?

06:24.618 --> 06:26.985
Oh, just sampling the
fine academic vintages

06:26.987 --> 06:29.488
of tomorrow's gas
station attendants.

06:29.490 --> 06:32.023
- You care to join?
- You're grading papers here.

06:32.025 --> 06:34.025
You know we had a
faculty meeting?

06:34.027 --> 06:36.728
Oh... damn it?

06:36.730 --> 06:40.665
Since we moved to three a week,
I just get them all mixed up.

06:40.667 --> 06:42.734
What the hell you're talking
about? We just have the two.

06:42.736 --> 06:44.453
Come to think of it,

06:44.454 --> 06:46.171
you have missed every
single Friday meeting.

06:46.173 --> 06:47.672
Get a damn TA.

06:47.674 --> 06:49.007
Jesus, it's been years.

06:49.009 --> 06:52.043
Kid probably got himself
deported or something.

07:23.744 --> 07:24.943
Hello?

07:36.890 --> 07:39.458
Hello? Dawn?

08:10.057 --> 08:12.123
Surprise!

08:12.125 --> 08:15.260
- What's with the knife, Sam?
- I just--

08:15.262 --> 08:17.829
You and the cupcake
agreed to a clean fight.

08:17.831 --> 08:21.032
I-- It's just I called you
and you didn't answer.

08:21.034 --> 08:22.868
That's how surprises
work, honey.

08:23.770 --> 08:25.770
Happy anniversary!

08:25.772 --> 08:26.905
Aw...

08:28.642 --> 08:31.576
You are so good and I was--

08:31.578 --> 08:33.578
I was at the office
and I didn't remember.

08:33.580 --> 08:36.280
Hush, hush, it's totally fine.

08:36.283 --> 08:38.817
You're just going to have
to make it up to me later.

08:39.820 --> 08:41.152
That is a deal.

08:45.993 --> 08:48.126
- Are you expecting someone?
- No.

09:05.312 --> 09:08.179
- Ooh.
- Sign here, please.

09:08.181 --> 09:11.016
Ooh.

09:11.018 --> 09:13.285
You ordered a whole
bunch of lead, right?

09:13.287 --> 09:15.053
This thing is so frickin' heavy.

09:15.055 --> 09:17.188
- Oh!
- Ooh.

09:17.190 --> 09:18.557
Oh, no.

09:20.561 --> 09:21.993
It's addressed to you, babe!

09:38.812 --> 09:41.246
What is this? A
subscription box?

09:41.248 --> 09:44.082
You're doing Indiana
Jones stuff now?

09:44.084 --> 09:45.817
It's from Sanjay.

09:45.819 --> 09:46.952
Sanjay?

09:48.822 --> 09:50.855
That-- that's crazy.

09:51.758 --> 09:53.325
He's been gone all these years,

09:53.327 --> 09:55.026
scares the shit out of everyone

09:55.028 --> 09:56.328
and then sends you
a box of junk?

09:56.330 --> 09:57.862
There's no mistaking it.

09:57.864 --> 10:01.666
This... This is the
text that Sanjay found.

10:01.668 --> 10:05.837
It's thousands of years old
and he wrote all over it.

10:05.839 --> 10:07.138
Let's call the police.

10:07.140 --> 10:09.307
And let them confiscate it? No.

10:09.309 --> 10:11.910
They wouldn't even know
what they are looking at.

10:11.912 --> 10:13.078
No, we--

10:13.080 --> 10:15.146
No, I, I need to help Sanjay.

10:15.148 --> 10:17.282
- He would do the same for me.
- I know.

10:18.185 --> 10:19.351
I know...

10:20.921 --> 10:22.053
I have faith in you.

10:22.055 --> 10:28.059
But can you fit some anniversary
dinner in your schedule first?

11:13.907 --> 11:15.173
Still at it?

11:15.175 --> 11:17.709
Just getting started.

11:35.796 --> 11:37.062
You have class early.

11:37.064 --> 11:38.797
Mm-hm.

11:42.102 --> 11:44.436
Happy anniversary!

11:44.438 --> 11:46.738
Thank you. You too.

11:54.081 --> 11:56.815
Well, don't stay up too late.

11:58.218 --> 12:00.218
- I love you.
- Love you too.

12:04.958 --> 12:06.157
Well, okay.

12:17.170 --> 12:21.272
Okay, Sanjay, what
does all of this mean?

13:08.855 --> 13:12.457
Help me,
help me, help me! Help me!

13:43.390 --> 13:46.157
Please, tell me you
didn't stay up all night.

13:46.159 --> 13:48.026
No, I slept, I just--

13:48.028 --> 13:50.195
You never quite made
it to bed, huh?

13:50.197 --> 13:53.231
God, and on our anniversary.

13:53.233 --> 13:55.333
God, I'm sorry I'm
such a shitty wife.

13:55.335 --> 13:57.202
It's not a big deal.

13:57.204 --> 14:00.271
I'm late for yoga. Make
sure you eat before class.

14:00.273 --> 14:03.007
Lecturing on low blood sugar is
against the rules, remember?

14:03.009 --> 14:04.943
- Mm-hm.
- Dispense some knowledge.

14:04.945 --> 14:06.344
Yeah, the ghost of Socrates

14:06.346 --> 14:08.613
is going to be so jealous
he could not have courses.

14:10.283 --> 14:12.884
- I love you.
- I love you too.

14:27.868 --> 14:29.968
Something museums.

14:38.111 --> 14:41.145
Grand, grand museums. Sure.

16:25.018 --> 16:27.151
I'm sorry, can I help you?

16:27.153 --> 16:30.521
I wasn't sure if that was
you or not, professor.

16:30.523 --> 16:33.725
We missed you in class, thought
maybe you were sick, but--

16:34.661 --> 16:36.427
Your Anthro 220 class.

16:36.429 --> 16:38.696
We sat there for like
15 minutes, but...

16:38.698 --> 16:42.700
Oh, my God! I was focused on
some other work and I just--

16:42.702 --> 16:44.135
No, it's cool.

16:44.137 --> 16:47.138
We'll just see you
next time, right?

16:50.043 --> 16:51.109
Okay...

16:55.448 --> 16:58.316
Wait, are you the one
that's been posting these?

16:58.318 --> 16:59.717
Yeah.

16:59.719 --> 17:01.219
Was he a student of yours?

17:03.156 --> 17:04.188
Grad student.

17:07.093 --> 17:08.559
Do you mind if I take this?

17:09.561 --> 17:10.494
Sure.

17:12.031 --> 17:12.797
Okay.

17:58.711 --> 17:59.644
Hey!

18:01.281 --> 18:03.114
It was you!

18:03.116 --> 18:04.649
You sent me the package.

18:04.651 --> 18:06.751
You left me the trail to follow.

18:07.854 --> 18:09.654
No-- I don't know what
you're talking about.

18:09.656 --> 18:11.089
I'm here to give you this.

18:13.760 --> 18:16.828
My mail box was out
of order, I take it?

18:16.830 --> 18:19.397
The door was unlocked.

18:19.399 --> 18:23.234
Aft-- after we talked
in the library,

18:23.236 --> 18:25.336
I asked around and
heard you needed a TA.

18:25.338 --> 18:27.271
And I was hoping that
you might consider--

18:27.273 --> 18:28.573
I don't need one.

18:28.575 --> 18:30.174
The department head said
that you did though--

18:30.176 --> 18:31.776
I don't care what he said.

18:31.778 --> 18:33.211
Are you--

18:34.147 --> 18:36.447
Are you even a grad student?

18:36.449 --> 18:37.381
No.

18:38.284 --> 18:39.617
It's just after I--

18:41.521 --> 18:44.755
After I saw the poster, I
wanted to help you find him.

18:49.662 --> 18:52.730
You can't just find him, okay?

18:52.732 --> 18:54.532
He's been gone for a long time.

18:54.534 --> 18:56.634
I've tried everything.
He's just--

18:57.470 --> 18:58.736
He's just gone.

18:59.739 --> 19:02.273
Then why are you posting those?

19:03.209 --> 19:06.277
Okay, I'm not clear on
why you would care.

19:07.447 --> 19:09.814
I've made posters
like those before.

19:11.551 --> 19:13.351
For my sister.

19:13.353 --> 19:15.720
She disappeared a few years ago.

19:17.190 --> 19:19.524
I'm sorry. I'm sorry that
you went through that.

19:19.526 --> 19:21.826
But it has nothing
to do with Sanjay.

19:21.828 --> 19:23.361
Did you even know him?

19:24.797 --> 19:25.763
No.

19:27.534 --> 19:29.700
Look, I'm sorry. I just--

19:30.603 --> 19:33.171
I saw the poster and...

19:33.173 --> 19:36.474
it was like it was
happening all over again

19:36.476 --> 19:38.376
and I don't know, it
might sound irrational,

19:38.378 --> 19:41.345
but I thought that maybe, if I
helped you find him, I could--

19:41.347 --> 19:43.314
Look, you're just a student.

19:43.316 --> 19:45.683
You have enough to worry about.

19:45.685 --> 19:49.854
I'm sorry, professor, but
that is not how this works.

19:49.856 --> 19:52.890
I never get to stop
worrying about my sister,

19:52.892 --> 19:55.660
just like you don't get to
stop looking for your student.

19:56.763 --> 19:57.695
Okay.

20:00.400 --> 20:03.267
God, this must be what it's
like to argue with me.

20:05.805 --> 20:07.405
So, what is your name?

20:07.407 --> 20:09.840
It's Chloe Bishop.

20:09.842 --> 20:11.309
Samantha Rand,

20:11.311 --> 20:13.644
Professor, I guess.

20:15.748 --> 20:18.783
Look, the majority of the search

20:18.785 --> 20:23.554
is back at my house if you want
to come help me go through it.

20:25.592 --> 20:27.291
Okay.

20:27.293 --> 20:30.528
And, if you prove to be helpful,

20:30.530 --> 20:34.999
I might consider bringing
you on as my TA, maybe.

20:48.648 --> 20:50.815
Hey, I'm home.

20:50.816 --> 20:52.983
It's about time.
What took you so long?

20:54.020 --> 20:56.687
When you said you left
something at the office,

20:56.689 --> 20:58.689
this wasn't exactly
what I imagined.

20:59.726 --> 21:00.992
No, I imagine not.

21:00.994 --> 21:03.394
Chloe, this is my wife,
Dawn. Dawn, Chloe.

21:03.396 --> 21:06.330
Um, Chloe's going to help
me with the project.

21:06.332 --> 21:07.832
She has a personal
interest in it.

21:07.834 --> 21:09.400
Well, it's been a long time

21:09.402 --> 21:11.502
since your last late-night
research party.

21:12.338 --> 21:14.505
- I'll whip up something.
- Thank you.

21:18.645 --> 21:22.747
When you were looking for
the person that you lost,

21:22.749 --> 21:24.849
you didn't happen to get
a random box of artifacts

21:24.851 --> 21:26.651
in the mail, just
on the off chance?

21:27.687 --> 21:29.687
No.

21:29.688 --> 21:31.688
You think this is all related
to Sanjay's disappearance?

21:31.691 --> 21:33.808
I do.

21:33.809 --> 21:35.926
Why don't you dig in and
see what you can find out?

21:56.883 --> 21:59.350
I think I found something.

21:59.352 --> 22:00.418
Maybe.

22:03.389 --> 22:06.557
It's just a drawing and it's only
appeared on the internet once.

22:07.527 --> 22:10.328
- How on the earth did you find--
- Reverse image lookup.

22:11.731 --> 22:13.614
Where's it from?

22:13.615 --> 22:15.498
It was published in a
psych study in 2015.

22:15.501 --> 22:16.867
This shrink was studying cases

22:16.869 --> 22:19.770
of extreme schizophrenia
and disassociation.

22:19.772 --> 22:23.674
It doesn't say what
the image is of,

22:23.676 --> 22:26.911
but maybe we can call
the doctor tomorrow.

22:26.913 --> 22:28.446
We can do one better than that.

22:28.448 --> 22:30.581
It's only a couple
of hours drive away.

22:33.753 --> 22:37.421
But first, I'm probably
going to take you home.

22:37.423 --> 22:38.923
I've kept you too long as it is.

22:38.925 --> 22:40.775
No, don't worry about it.

22:40.776 --> 22:42.626
It's-- I feel like I'm actually
doing something, you know?

22:42.628 --> 22:43.594
It feels good.

22:43.596 --> 22:44.862
Calling it a night?

22:44.864 --> 22:46.897
And you look wiped.

22:46.899 --> 22:49.467
I'll be taking the young
lady home this evening.

22:49.469 --> 22:50.401
Thank you.

22:51.504 --> 22:52.703
Thank you.

23:15.461 --> 23:16.594
Okay.

23:16.596 --> 23:17.561
Chloe.

23:17.563 --> 23:20.931
I really want to thank
you for helping Sam.

23:20.933 --> 23:24.135
This Sanjay thing has
been really hard on her.

23:24.137 --> 23:25.803
It's fine, I um--

23:26.639 --> 23:29.807
I am not really being
entirely selfless either.

23:29.809 --> 23:31.976
Well, I know Sam

23:33.012 --> 23:35.446
and, when she's
set on something,

23:35.448 --> 23:37.948
she's going to keep
going until it's done.

23:37.950 --> 23:39.984
And I'm not in that
world with her,

23:41.487 --> 23:42.420
but you are.

23:45.191 --> 23:46.657
Would you look out for her?

23:50.596 --> 23:52.196
She means the world to me.

23:58.671 --> 23:59.870
Yeah, yeah.

24:03.609 --> 24:05.042
Thank you.

25:29.195 --> 25:32.696
Ah, wife, come join us.

25:32.698 --> 25:33.864
We're about to play around.

25:34.700 --> 25:36.600
What do you say?

25:36.602 --> 25:39.803
Ah, she's too timid
for these stakes,

25:39.805 --> 25:42.540
too frightened to even speak.

25:42.542 --> 25:44.542
I hardly know her, yet I can see

25:44.544 --> 25:47.945
she's not clever enough to
understand what's going on.

25:48.881 --> 25:50.548
There are rules.

25:50.550 --> 25:52.049
She gets a chance.

25:52.051 --> 25:53.050
Sit.

26:04.630 --> 26:05.596
She consents.

26:11.971 --> 26:13.837
She's not equal to the task.

26:13.839 --> 26:16.040
The truth is too large for her.

26:16.042 --> 26:18.709
This is not good, professor.

26:19.612 --> 26:21.178
She is lost.

26:58.751 --> 26:59.917
You okay?

26:59.919 --> 27:01.385
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

27:01.387 --> 27:04.188
It's probably just my
sinuses or something.

27:04.190 --> 27:05.389
Sorry, I woke you.

27:05.391 --> 27:07.825
No, it's okay. Do
you want some water?

27:07.827 --> 27:09.860
No, just go back to sleep.

27:10.997 --> 27:13.797
Actually, I'm going to get up.

27:13.799 --> 27:15.132
I'm going to get an early start.

27:15.134 --> 27:16.333
What do you mean?

27:16.335 --> 27:18.035
Nothing.

27:18.037 --> 27:19.003
Um...

27:19.939 --> 27:22.623
Chloe found something last night

27:22.624 --> 27:25.308
and it's few hours up north
and I just want to follow up.

27:25.311 --> 27:26.944
But what about class?

27:28.414 --> 27:30.080
Um...

27:30.082 --> 27:32.883
I'll check in with Thomas.
There's no way he'll say no.

27:32.885 --> 27:35.352
Oh, come on!
Thomas is the worst.

27:35.354 --> 27:36.854
Don't lose your job over this.

27:38.124 --> 27:39.056
I know.

27:40.292 --> 27:42.059
I'll call him, okay?

27:42.061 --> 27:43.727
I love you.

27:43.729 --> 27:44.928
I love you too.

28:07.019 --> 28:09.453
I wasn't expecting
something quite so homey

28:09.455 --> 28:12.389
for someone who specializes
in the tough cases.

28:12.391 --> 28:14.324
It's useful for people
to feel comfortable

28:14.326 --> 28:16.193
when chatting with me.

28:16.195 --> 28:19.229
I'm not sure candy works on an
anthropology professor though.

28:25.204 --> 28:27.771
Look, um...

28:27.773 --> 28:30.107
I'm interested in a drawing.

28:30.109 --> 28:33.877
Uh, does this look
familiar to you?

28:39.351 --> 28:40.751
It does.

28:41.854 --> 28:43.120
Do you mind me asking

28:43.122 --> 28:45.723
what the significance is
to an anthropologist?

28:47.093 --> 28:48.425
That's what I'm
trying to find out.

28:48.427 --> 28:50.227
Well, I'm not sure
you'll have much luck.

28:50.229 --> 28:53.197
The patient who drew that
isn't very communicative.

28:53.199 --> 28:55.499
Well, maybe I could
speak with them.

28:55.501 --> 28:59.970
That would be against policy
and most certainly pointless.

29:02.241 --> 29:04.141
Look, what could happen?

29:04.143 --> 29:05.976
It's either no harm, no foul

29:05.978 --> 29:09.313
or your unresponsive patient
becomes responsive, right?

29:09.315 --> 29:13.951
I'm sorry. The policy stands,
immediate family only.

29:19.191 --> 29:21.425
Just out of curiosity,

29:21.427 --> 29:25.062
does your patient do other
drawings of symbols?

29:25.064 --> 29:28.065
Any chance they drew this one?

29:29.401 --> 29:31.368
Or maybe this one?

29:42.181 --> 29:43.113
Colton,

29:44.216 --> 29:45.449
you have a visitor.

29:47.219 --> 29:49.086
It should be okay
to approach him.

29:55.861 --> 29:58.028
Hey, Colton.

29:59.064 --> 30:01.999
I was wondering if you could
help me with something.

30:07.439 --> 30:09.940
Can you tell me
about your drawing?

30:11.076 --> 30:12.075
Yeah?

30:27.426 --> 30:28.559
What about these?

30:32.064 --> 30:33.597
These are his.

30:33.599 --> 30:35.532
His!

30:35.533 --> 30:37.466
You should not have these.
Someone's a thief.

30:40.973 --> 30:45.209
Roll the bones, oldest
trick in the book.

30:46.312 --> 30:48.111
You want to know
what happens next?

30:52.551 --> 30:54.885
I bet you didn't win.

30:56.989 --> 30:58.021
Colton!

31:01.060 --> 31:02.159
Ah.

31:03.095 --> 31:05.596
Someone lost the game.

31:05.598 --> 31:07.464
Tell me about the dice.

31:07.466 --> 31:09.032
Tell me what the drawings mean.

31:09.034 --> 31:10.434
Shouldn't have them!

31:11.370 --> 31:13.103
Someone's a thief.

31:14.273 --> 31:16.106
Stole from museum!

31:16.942 --> 31:19.343
Museum, Grand Museum?

31:24.149 --> 31:26.416
He's watching you,
watching your heart.

31:27.586 --> 31:29.453
He wants to know
if you're scared.

31:30.489 --> 31:33.891
I'm scared, you
should be scared.

31:33.893 --> 31:36.126
Oh, God! Oh, you should run.

31:36.128 --> 31:37.127
You should run.

31:37.129 --> 31:38.262
Oh, fuck that!

31:38.264 --> 31:40.264
You should die.
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

31:40.266 --> 31:42.366
You should die. Fucking,
kill yourself now

31:42.368 --> 31:44.034
before it's all--

31:44.036 --> 31:45.402
It burns in here!

31:45.404 --> 31:48.272
Burns and scathes
and no room for you!

31:49.475 --> 31:53.110
Oh, my God, it burns--
There's no room in here.

31:53.112 --> 31:56.013
But they'll give
you a room in here!

31:56.015 --> 31:57.414
They'll give you a room in here!

31:57.416 --> 31:59.483
Colton! Orderly!

31:59.485 --> 32:01.685
Professor Rand, out now!

32:01.687 --> 32:04.021
But the drawing,
it will lead you

32:04.023 --> 32:05.122
like it led me.

32:05.124 --> 32:06.990
Fear and lead.

32:06.992 --> 32:09.059
Like lead, you know, so heavy!

32:09.061 --> 32:10.928
It's okay. It's okay.

32:10.930 --> 32:12.329
You should die!

32:12.331 --> 32:13.630
You should die!

32:13.632 --> 32:15.666
- I wish I did.
- Settle down.

32:15.668 --> 32:18.035
- I wish I did!
- Settle down.

32:18.037 --> 32:19.269
Just settle.

32:26.578 --> 32:28.512
Oh, Chloe, come on in.

32:28.514 --> 32:29.479
Who's Chloe?

32:29.481 --> 32:32.549
Just one of my students. I
guess you got my voice mail.

32:32.551 --> 32:34.835
I did.

32:34.836 --> 32:37.120
But an interesting lead is no
excuse for missing meetings.

32:37.122 --> 32:39.957
And I heard you missed a
class out of the blue.

32:39.959 --> 32:43.593
Okay, circumstances have
been a little abnormal,

32:43.595 --> 32:45.963
but this isn't just a lead.

32:45.965 --> 32:48.098
This is the kind of research
that can make headlines.

32:48.100 --> 32:51.335
Regardless, it's no excuse
for missing meetings.

32:51.337 --> 32:52.970
Do your job.

33:00.546 --> 33:02.579
Is now a bad time?

33:02.581 --> 33:03.647
Um...

33:04.483 --> 33:05.582
Ignore him.

33:08.354 --> 33:09.553
So, uh...

33:11.590 --> 33:12.589
lead.

33:13.425 --> 33:16.126
It means "to lead".

33:16.128 --> 33:18.161
You went to see
the psychiatrist?

33:18.163 --> 33:19.646
Oh, yeah.

33:19.647 --> 33:21.130
I met the patient
who did the drawing.

33:21.133 --> 33:24.001
He was, um... interesting.

33:26.705 --> 33:31.708
Well, I could come by later
tonight, if that's okay.

33:31.710 --> 33:33.176
Great.

33:33.178 --> 33:34.411
Okay.

33:44.023 --> 33:47.657
Where are you leading me to?

34:05.344 --> 34:08.078
CT scans and symptoms

34:08.080 --> 34:11.514
consistent with exposure
to unfiltered reality.

34:11.516 --> 34:13.183
You did this to me, Sam.

34:13.185 --> 34:14.818
How will you protect me, Sam?

34:14.820 --> 34:16.152
I suspect the patient--

34:16.155 --> 34:18.522
I've seen the naked
face of truth.

34:18.524 --> 34:21.491
Unable to grasp what
she's just witnessed.

34:21.493 --> 34:25.429
She's attempting to process the
experience in a perpetual level.

34:25.431 --> 34:29.699
Perpetual level.

34:29.701 --> 34:31.768
A self-imposed hell.

34:31.770 --> 34:34.471
Worried that, incessantly--

34:34.473 --> 34:36.806
a rotting tooth of the mind.

34:36.809 --> 34:39.376
The situation recalls
an expression

34:39.378 --> 34:42.245
about omelets and eggs.

34:42.246 --> 34:44.214
We were going
to prove them wrong,

34:44.216 --> 34:45.815
it's us against the world.

34:45.818 --> 34:49.585
Not everyone can walk in
the light of truth, Sam.

34:49.588 --> 34:51.855
Some will merely burn.

34:53.792 --> 34:57.160
There, see? I'm done.

34:57.162 --> 35:01.231
I need you to learn all
of it, you understand?

35:01.233 --> 35:05.469
See, I've lead you
exactly how he led me.

35:07.272 --> 35:11.174
Now, the great work will not be
stopped for our convenience.

35:11.176 --> 35:13.760
There's not a lot of time.

35:13.761 --> 35:16.345
We are going to need
you to take notes.

35:16.348 --> 35:17.614
There'll be a test.

35:17.616 --> 35:19.850
Wait, wait, I don't have
anything to write with.

35:22.154 --> 35:23.820
Speaking from experience,

35:23.822 --> 35:27.124
I'm quite confident that
you're wrong there.

35:27.860 --> 35:30.327
Take it, you
hesitate, it's gone.

35:30.329 --> 35:32.295
You wake up, all
of this is gone!

35:32.297 --> 35:34.831
Do it. Do it!

35:34.833 --> 35:36.466
Do it!

35:36.468 --> 35:39.202
Come on, professor! Do it!

35:39.204 --> 35:40.437
Do it!

35:40.439 --> 35:41.771
Do it!

36:35.294 --> 36:38.728
So, Thomas was in
her room yelling at her?

36:40.232 --> 36:42.232
He's always had it out for her.

36:42.234 --> 36:44.201
And now he has a better excuse

36:44.203 --> 36:46.436
than disapproving of
our lifestyle choice.

36:46.438 --> 36:49.539
Shitty old white guys, best
part of academia, right?

36:49.541 --> 36:50.974
I'll drink to that.

36:52.477 --> 36:53.443
Sam.

36:54.346 --> 36:56.513
Hon, are you okay?

36:56.515 --> 36:59.382
- Fine!
- You look a mess.

36:59.384 --> 37:01.918
I'm just-- I'm just
eager to get to it.

37:01.920 --> 37:04.788
No, you're going to go rest.

37:04.790 --> 37:08.425
No, I gotta--
I gotta do this, please.

37:15.934 --> 37:18.235
I thought you'd be
home a few hours ago,

37:18.237 --> 37:20.337
so I've been working
on this for a while.

37:20.339 --> 37:22.772
I don't think it's
an actual language.

37:22.774 --> 37:25.575
There's nothing on the internet
that's like it and I--

37:26.845 --> 37:28.678
- What?
- I can read it.

37:29.581 --> 37:30.914
All of it.

37:30.916 --> 37:32.616
You're kidding.

37:33.652 --> 37:36.720
No, it's an ancient
lost language.

37:36.722 --> 37:38.455
Proto-Sino-Tibetan.

37:38.457 --> 37:40.390
It led to Chinese
and other languages

37:40.392 --> 37:42.025
from that region, but...

37:43.829 --> 37:45.462
it's pictographic.

37:45.464 --> 37:46.563
Here.

37:52.437 --> 37:53.637
God...

37:54.973 --> 37:57.707
Wait, how long did
this take you?

37:57.709 --> 37:59.309
This afternoon.

38:25.470 --> 38:27.037
Uh, here's what I've got.

38:28.874 --> 38:31.708
"Winter, sleep, ground, you,
flame, men, naked, summer, sun."

38:33.645 --> 38:34.944
Some more nonsense.

38:36.548 --> 38:38.448
Okay, maybe this language
is just too old.

38:38.450 --> 38:41.451
No, no, that's ridiculous.

38:41.453 --> 38:44.087
Winter, sleep, ground,
you, flame, men--

38:44.089 --> 38:46.056
Doesn't that sound familiar?

38:47.459 --> 38:52.495
Winter, sleep,
winter, sleep, winter, sleep.

38:52.497 --> 38:53.596
Oh, God...

38:56.568 --> 38:57.600
This.

39:01.640 --> 39:02.572
Yes!

39:02.574 --> 39:05.342
"In the winter, he
sleeps on the floor

39:05.344 --> 39:07.577
in front of the
fire with the men

39:07.579 --> 39:10.613
and goes about all in
rags, but, in summer..."

39:10.615 --> 39:12.682
Ah, that is it!
It's <i> The Odyssey.</i>

39:12.684 --> 39:15.051
No, that's insane, it's
not even in Greek.

39:15.053 --> 39:16.686
How could you possibly
figure that out?

39:16.688 --> 39:18.521
It's because I teach it.

39:18.523 --> 39:21.558
I mean, hell, you just
took an exam on it, right?

39:22.794 --> 39:23.760
My God...

39:23.762 --> 39:27.864
Wait, this was--
this was purposeful.

39:28.800 --> 39:30.383
Only a handful of people

39:30.384 --> 39:31.967
could have ever possibly
figured that out.

39:31.970 --> 39:33.937
This was meant for you.

39:33.939 --> 39:35.472
Can I see the book?

39:43.048 --> 39:45.582
Winter he sleeps
on the ground...

39:47.085 --> 39:48.785
This "you" is wrong.

39:48.787 --> 39:52.088
Winter sleeps, ground, you--

39:54.793 --> 39:56.493
This "you" is a mistake.

39:56.495 --> 39:57.794
No way! Someone goes
through this much effort,

39:57.796 --> 40:00.630
they're not going to make
a mistake like that.

40:00.632 --> 40:03.900
Wait a minute, what
else doesn't match?

40:04.903 --> 40:06.436
Okay, this "are".

40:07.472 --> 40:09.606
"You are...

40:11.042 --> 40:14.677
asleep and awake."

40:18.717 --> 40:22.085
Okay, uh, it's a dream guide.

40:22.087 --> 40:25.422
Grand museums, leads,

40:25.424 --> 40:30.527
"You are asleep... and awake."

40:30.529 --> 40:31.494
You.

40:32.531 --> 40:34.664
This doesn't make
any fucking sense!

40:34.666 --> 40:37.434
I mean, what the fuck am I
supposed to do with that?

40:38.136 --> 40:39.869
Um, we're just exhausted.

40:39.871 --> 40:43.473
This will all make
sense tomorrow.

40:44.476 --> 40:45.708
What was that?

40:50.549 --> 40:51.881
I dropped a book.

40:55.153 --> 40:56.553
I'm going to head out.

40:58.023 --> 40:59.022
Good night.

41:04.796 --> 41:06.729
- Did you throw a book at her?
- No, I just--

41:06.731 --> 41:08.164
What was that?

41:08.165 --> 41:09.598
Look, no one gives a
shit about my hand.

41:09.601 --> 41:10.700
- I just--
- Sh.

41:11.670 --> 41:12.836
I give a shit.

41:14.172 --> 41:16.673
What the fuck is going on?

41:16.675 --> 41:19.843
You're throwing shit,
your hand's all cut up

41:19.845 --> 41:21.177
and you're lying to me.

41:23.215 --> 41:24.547
Sam,

41:26.685 --> 41:28.184
when have we ever
lied to each other?

41:35.794 --> 41:37.026
I'm going to bed.

41:51.009 --> 41:52.842
Are you coming too?

41:53.912 --> 41:54.878
No.

41:58.183 --> 42:00.149
I'm going to stay
up for a while.

42:04.089 --> 42:05.255
Get some rest.

43:33.745 --> 43:34.911
What's going on?

43:34.913 --> 43:36.179
Come on, open!

43:38.116 --> 43:39.782
Dawn? Dawn?

43:39.784 --> 43:42.251
You are
not permitted passage.

43:42.253 --> 43:45.221
You are yet to make
yourself worthy.

43:45.223 --> 43:48.257
You lack the
conviction to proceed.

43:48.259 --> 43:50.660
Where's Dawn? Where's my wife?

43:50.662 --> 43:53.963
It would be better,
easier to choose death.

43:56.001 --> 43:59.402
<i>The price of knowing
is always the same.</i>

44:00.805 --> 44:03.306
<i>Your offering is accepted.</i>

44:03.308 --> 44:07.677
She shall sleep among the
in their millions.

44:07.679 --> 44:10.947
<i> You shall</i>
<i>sleep. You shall sleep...</i>

45:04.836 --> 45:06.069
You're okay.

45:13.845 --> 45:16.979
Baby, why wouldn't I be?

45:16.981 --> 45:18.114
No reason.

45:19.084 --> 45:20.483
I'm so sorry.

45:27.325 --> 45:31.828
Oh, I just cut myself when
I put my necklace on.

45:31.830 --> 45:33.029
It's no big deal.

45:35.033 --> 45:38.468
Wait, what's in the bag?

45:38.470 --> 45:41.070
Nothing, just go back to bed.

45:41.072 --> 45:43.473
No, wait, what's going
on? What are you doing?

45:43.475 --> 45:45.808
What are you doing with those?

45:45.810 --> 45:48.845
- What are you doing?
- Those aren't good for you!

45:48.847 --> 45:51.948
I don't know, but something
in them is making you sick.

45:52.784 --> 45:54.817
- That's ridiculous.
- Really?

45:54.819 --> 45:56.152
You're sleeping like shit,

45:56.154 --> 45:58.521
you could lose your job and
you're hurting yourself.

45:58.523 --> 46:01.958
I'm fine. I'm just under
a little bit of stress.

46:01.960 --> 46:03.760
Stress? Come on, Sam!

46:03.762 --> 46:06.262
We've been together long enough.
This is something else.

46:07.465 --> 46:09.365
- Give me the bag!
- No!

46:09.367 --> 46:12.101
You got to know I'm doing
this for your own good.

46:16.207 --> 46:17.907
I can't--

46:17.909 --> 46:20.009
I can't believe

46:20.011 --> 46:22.145
that the person I trusted
the most in the world

46:22.147 --> 46:24.113
would steal from me.

46:24.115 --> 46:26.015
When all I'm trying to do,

46:26.017 --> 46:29.986
the only thing I am trying
to do is to find Sanjay.

46:29.988 --> 46:31.320
Sanjay?

46:31.322 --> 46:33.823
You're killing
yourself over Sanjay?

46:33.825 --> 46:35.825
You don't even know
that he's involved!

46:40.932 --> 46:42.865
Sam?

46:42.867 --> 46:45.835
Sam, don't go like
this! Do not go.

46:45.837 --> 46:47.537
Sam, look, I'll give
them back to you.

46:47.539 --> 46:48.805
I'll give them back to you.

46:57.115 --> 46:59.148
Sam, don't leave.

46:59.150 --> 47:01.350
Don't. Come on, we
can figure this out.

47:02.854 --> 47:04.320
Just talk to me.

47:05.890 --> 47:07.423
Talk to me.

47:09.294 --> 47:10.359
I'm sorry.

47:13.898 --> 47:15.464
I love you.

49:12.417 --> 49:14.650
Okay, I'm inside.

49:17.722 --> 49:19.655
<i> We need a place</i>
<i>she won't look at every day</i>

49:19.657 --> 49:21.958
<i>and so that no one else
will stumble across it.</i>

49:22.727 --> 49:23.960
I got it.

49:27.465 --> 49:29.131
Holy shit!

49:29.133 --> 49:31.500
You know? This would be
a hundred times easier

49:31.502 --> 49:33.319
if we just asked her to help.

49:33.320 --> 49:35.137
<i> Your professor,</i>
<i>you really care for her?</i>

49:36.274 --> 49:37.206
Yeah.

49:38.209 --> 49:39.475
Of course, she's...

49:41.079 --> 49:42.845
She's my best friend.

49:42.846 --> 49:44.612
<i>You'd like for her to be able
to pass another night in peace?</i>

49:45.616 --> 49:49.251
<i>Then keep that damn
foolishness out of your mouth.</i>

49:49.253 --> 49:52.121
<i>It's likely that you and
I will die doing this.</i>

49:52.123 --> 49:54.590
<i>This is our contingency, Sanjay.</i>

49:54.592 --> 49:57.326
<i>A signpost on the path for
your professor should we fail.</i>

49:57.328 --> 49:59.846
I just--

49:59.847 --> 50:02.365
<i> To become the map for</i>
<i>mankind's journey to light...</i>

50:02.367 --> 50:04.333
<i>any price is a bargain.</i>

50:08.473 --> 50:11.073
Isn't
that right, Samantha?

50:13.111 --> 50:16.545
You're already thinking
about it, aren't you?

50:17.682 --> 50:22.184
Weighing, whether or not,
you could live with yourself

50:23.021 --> 50:25.621
if you sacrificed everyone.

50:26.791 --> 50:29.625
You're such an eager
student, aren't you?

51:28.086 --> 51:30.386
- Hey!
- Oh, my God!

51:31.556 --> 51:33.722
Thank you so
much for coming.

51:33.724 --> 51:35.524
Absolutely.

51:35.526 --> 51:37.259
I just didn't know what to do.

51:37.261 --> 51:39.862
So, she just left-- in
the middle of the night?

51:41.399 --> 51:42.531
We had a fight

51:44.769 --> 51:48.304
and she just wouldn't
let go of those things.

51:48.306 --> 51:49.638
I didn't want her
to leave, but--

51:49.640 --> 51:51.340
No, of course not.

51:51.342 --> 51:53.676
Look, I know I hardly know her,

51:53.678 --> 51:56.312
but this stuff is getting
to her, I can tell.

51:56.314 --> 51:59.181
It's like our life just
got turned inside out

51:59.183 --> 52:00.816
all of a sudden.

52:00.818 --> 52:02.685
But I'm going to do
something about it.

52:11.562 --> 52:12.395
Okay, she's gone.

52:12.396 --> 52:13.229
Class is still for
another 50 minutes,

52:13.231 --> 52:15.231
so we should have some time.

52:15.233 --> 52:17.800
Wait, shouldn't you be in class

52:17.802 --> 52:19.468
not breaking and
entering with me?

52:19.470 --> 52:21.454
No.

52:21.455 --> 52:23.439
Keeping your wife from
retiring to a padded cell

52:23.441 --> 52:25.374
is way more important right now.

52:46.430 --> 52:48.731
Hold on, this is new.

52:53.237 --> 52:54.703
Um...

52:54.705 --> 53:00.209
"Only when the young crescent
moon's light alone shines."

53:01.312 --> 53:02.711
Does that mean something?

53:03.614 --> 53:06.215
Could be part of the
message we're working on.

53:06.951 --> 53:09.785
Crescent, crescent...

53:09.787 --> 53:12.454
I'm getting an awful
feeling about this.

53:29.307 --> 53:31.941
Yes. Okay, so there was a
new moon five days ago.

53:31.943 --> 53:35.411
So, this young crescent moon
is either tonight or tomorrow.

53:43.654 --> 53:45.387
Whoa, wait, wait!
What are you doing?

53:45.389 --> 53:46.956
What? You take that and
she's going to know

53:46.958 --> 53:48.791
that you came in here
and stole this stuff.

53:48.793 --> 53:51.594
So? This is my wife
we're talking about.

53:51.596 --> 53:53.862
There's no way Sam's not
going to resent you for that.

53:53.864 --> 53:56.565
And right now she's probably
just blowing off steam.

53:57.602 --> 54:00.002
So what? We just wait?

54:00.004 --> 54:01.904
And we just let her go
down this rabbit hole?

54:01.906 --> 54:06.575
Dawn, we know exactly
what she knows.

54:06.577 --> 54:08.611
So we're going to keep
a close eye on her

54:08.613 --> 54:10.012
and, when nothing
happens tonight

54:10.014 --> 54:12.414
and nothing happens tomorrow,

54:12.416 --> 54:14.650
she's going to realize
this was all in her head.

54:17.488 --> 54:18.520
Okay.

54:21.025 --> 54:21.957
All right.

54:39.744 --> 54:43.812
"Only when the young crescent
moon's light alone shines,

54:45.650 --> 54:47.516
the dream guide leads.

54:49.353 --> 54:51.854
You are asleep and awake,

54:52.890 --> 54:55.057
grand museums?"

54:55.059 --> 54:57.559
Where the fuck is it? Ah!

54:59.463 --> 55:02.998
"You are asleep and awake."

55:05.803 --> 55:06.769
Oh.

55:08.673 --> 55:11.740
"You are asleep and awake."

55:13.544 --> 55:15.544
"You are asleep and awake."

55:27.591 --> 55:29.758
"You are asleep and awake."

57:34.718 --> 57:35.651
You.

57:40.458 --> 57:42.858
You are foolish too.

57:42.860 --> 57:45.160
Found your way here

57:45.162 --> 57:47.596
to this hypnagogic state

57:48.499 --> 57:50.532
or is it hypnopompic?

57:52.670 --> 57:55.137
It's both.

57:55.139 --> 57:58.073
Place liminal to sleep
and wakefulness.

57:58.075 --> 58:00.609
I'm trying to help you.

58:00.611 --> 58:02.044
Tell me how to find you.

58:03.514 --> 58:06.548
Your journey won't
be a pleasant one,

58:06.550 --> 58:10.619
especially with that
failing liver of yours.

58:12.490 --> 58:16.825
So desperate, you
poisoned yourself.

58:16.827 --> 58:18.827
Even I didn't go that far.

58:19.730 --> 58:22.764
I suppose one could argue.

58:27.571 --> 58:29.605
It means you're ready.

58:29.606 --> 58:31.640
I gave you everything you
needed, Sam, to bring you here.

58:32.776 --> 58:37.513
Within the voice of wisdom.

59:03.941 --> 59:06.708
<i> I gave you</i>
<i>everything you needed, Sam.</i>

59:16.320 --> 59:20.188
<i>Within the voice of wisdom.</i>

01:00:15.713 --> 01:00:16.979
Oh, dear God!

01:00:21.685 --> 01:00:23.018
I'm calling help.

01:00:26.657 --> 01:00:27.856
Please, come.

01:00:47.011 --> 01:00:48.010
Sam!

01:00:49.380 --> 01:00:50.712
Sam!

01:00:52.082 --> 01:00:54.716
You okay? How are you feeling?

01:00:54.718 --> 01:00:56.351
Oh, you're awake.

01:00:56.352 --> 01:00:57.985
Hold on, hold on. I'll
get the doctor, okay?

01:00:57.988 --> 01:01:00.122
Wait, wait.

01:01:01.258 --> 01:01:02.691
What happened?

01:01:08.766 --> 01:01:11.266
Thomas found you in
your office last night.

01:01:14.171 --> 01:01:16.138
You were sick.

01:01:16.140 --> 01:01:17.105
Um...

01:01:19.343 --> 01:01:21.243
They said you overdosed.

01:01:22.813 --> 01:01:26.181
That you did some
damage to your liver.

01:01:26.183 --> 01:01:28.316
And you could have
gone in a coma...

01:01:29.186 --> 01:01:30.252
or died.

01:01:40.264 --> 01:01:41.963
I love you so much.

01:01:45.369 --> 01:01:46.935
Why would you do that?

01:01:49.740 --> 01:01:51.239
I'm here for you.

01:01:52.109 --> 01:01:53.709
You could have talked to me.

01:01:56.413 --> 01:01:58.747
Just go get the doctor, please.

01:02:00.884 --> 01:02:04.286
- Sam...
- Dawn, go get the doctor!

01:02:09.059 --> 01:02:10.125
Just go.

01:02:56.340 --> 01:02:58.340
Hey, Chloe, I was just
about to text you.

01:02:58.342 --> 01:03:00.342
<i>- I think I found something.</i>
- She left.

01:03:01.912 --> 01:03:03.411
She left? What happened?

01:03:03.413 --> 01:03:05.330
I tried to stop her,

01:03:05.331 --> 01:03:07.248
but then she shoved me up against
the wall and she was screaming and...

01:03:07.251 --> 01:03:09.384
Okay, is she still
in the hospital?

01:03:09.386 --> 01:03:10.919
I don't know. Maybe.

01:03:10.921 --> 01:03:12.187
- I'm sorry, Chloe.
<i>- No.</i>

01:03:12.189 --> 01:03:13.221
I should have stopped her.

01:03:13.223 --> 01:03:16.258
<i>Dawn, she was out of control.</i>

01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:18.227
Look, why don't you
come back here?

01:03:18.228 --> 01:03:20.195
No, no. If she's in the
hospital, they'll find her.

01:03:20.197 --> 01:03:23.899
If not, I might know
where she's going.

01:03:23.901 --> 01:03:26.968
I think I've finally found what
she's been obsessing over.

01:03:42.052 --> 01:03:44.586
- Hey, thanks for the tip!
- Yeah, you bet.

01:04:23.227 --> 01:04:25.627
Hello? Anyone here?

01:04:48.118 --> 01:04:49.317
Holy shit!

01:04:51.088 --> 01:04:52.287
Sam...

01:05:02.266 --> 01:05:04.199
I need full compliance,

01:05:04.201 --> 01:05:07.102
otherwise, I get to change
the date on the placard.

01:05:08.205 --> 01:05:09.571
Why are you here?

01:05:10.607 --> 01:05:12.374
Did the little lamb get lost?

01:05:12.376 --> 01:05:14.476
No, no. I was led here.

01:05:14.478 --> 01:05:15.878
Explain!

01:05:15.879 --> 01:05:17.279
In my dreams, my
student, Sanjay...

01:05:17.281 --> 01:05:19.447
Mr. Ramdas, mm.

01:05:19.449 --> 01:05:21.082
I'm sorry, no exceptions.

01:05:21.084 --> 01:05:23.551
The museum is for
ticket holders only.

01:05:23.553 --> 01:05:26.688
I choose what happens
to intruders.

01:05:26.690 --> 01:05:28.957
I have-- in my pocket
I have my ticket.

01:05:28.959 --> 01:05:31.660
I'm not sure that I care.

01:05:31.662 --> 01:05:34.963
<i>Security, we talked about this.</i>

01:05:34.965 --> 01:05:38.033
<i>Check our guest for a ticket
before you have your laughs.</i>

01:05:38.035 --> 01:05:39.501
You're no fun.

01:05:40.704 --> 01:05:43.405
<i>It's not my job to be fun, pet.</i>

01:05:43.407 --> 01:05:47.309
<i>Shouldn't be my job to
babysit you either.</i>

01:05:47.311 --> 01:05:48.677
I have my ticket.

01:05:51.114 --> 01:05:52.681
Wait! Where's Sanjay?

01:05:52.683 --> 01:05:55.116
My job is to keep
out undesirables.

01:05:55.118 --> 01:05:56.484
I don't have to help you.

01:05:57.354 --> 01:06:00.055
Good luck finding your way.

01:06:00.057 --> 01:06:03.024
Be careful of the
hungrier exhibits.

01:08:46.189 --> 01:08:47.589
Hey!

01:08:47.591 --> 01:08:49.174
Oh!

01:08:49.175 --> 01:08:50.758
Oh,
what the hell are you doing with that?

01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:53.728
That's a bloody priceless
relic you're tossing.

01:08:54.564 --> 01:08:57.198
Were you planning on clubbing
me the thing, were you?

01:08:57.200 --> 01:08:58.867
Ugh, rude!

01:08:59.803 --> 01:09:03.203
A saint used that cross
in the 13th century,

01:09:03.206 --> 01:09:04.471
Edmund of Canterbury.

01:09:06.877 --> 01:09:09.176
Here's the fibular taken
from his left leg

01:09:09.179 --> 01:09:12.147
and it healed people
that touched it.

01:09:12.149 --> 01:09:13.814
Well, actually the healing
part is a little bullocks,

01:09:13.817 --> 01:09:15.850
but they did make his
leg burn the relic.

01:09:16.853 --> 01:09:20.755
And that's not in my collection
yet, if I'm being honest.

01:09:21.691 --> 01:09:24.626
What do you have that
stupid look on your face for?

01:09:26.630 --> 01:09:28.328
Who are you?

01:09:29.232 --> 01:09:31.799
My darling, I'm a docent.

01:09:31.801 --> 01:09:36.371
You are in a museum. Are
you that easily confused?

01:09:36.372 --> 01:09:38.872
What kind of museum exactly?

01:09:38.875 --> 01:09:40.859
<i>The</i> museum--

01:09:40.859 --> 01:09:42.844
Well, not the museum
of this or that,

01:09:42.845 --> 01:09:46.613
but rather "The Museum".

01:09:47.817 --> 01:09:49.484
Why would Sanjay bring me here?

01:09:49.486 --> 01:09:51.386
Why does anyone come here?

01:09:52.923 --> 01:09:57.258
They were led here either
by donating something or...

01:09:59.329 --> 01:10:00.695
just going mad.

01:10:00.697 --> 01:10:01.629
Oh, mad?

01:10:01.631 --> 01:10:03.565
Yes, dear.

01:10:03.567 --> 01:10:06.801
Ooh, you've been quite a
long ways now, haven't you?

01:10:06.803 --> 01:10:07.936
Rough trip here?

01:10:09.940 --> 01:10:12.440
I'm looking for my student.

01:10:12.442 --> 01:10:13.675
His name is Sanjay.

01:10:13.677 --> 01:10:14.976
Hmm, yes, I know him.

01:10:14.978 --> 01:10:16.544
If you just follow me.

01:10:31.228 --> 01:10:32.460
Uh--

01:10:32.462 --> 01:10:34.362
I, uh--

01:10:34.364 --> 01:10:35.964
I don't go in there.

01:10:35.966 --> 01:10:37.498
Uh, well...

01:10:38.401 --> 01:10:40.001
Thank you for your
patronage, dear,

01:10:40.003 --> 01:10:42.537
and do take care to keep
off the carpeted areas

01:10:42.539 --> 01:10:44.606
in case you decide to, uh--

01:10:47.244 --> 01:10:47.976
Well...

01:11:08.431 --> 01:11:10.498
Dear, dear, dear.

01:11:24.047 --> 01:11:25.747
Magnificent, isn't it?

01:11:29.352 --> 01:11:30.785
Sanjay!

01:11:32.422 --> 01:11:35.790
I've been looking for you and
you've been here the whole time?

01:11:35.792 --> 01:11:37.308
I know.

01:11:37.309 --> 01:11:38.825
That's what gave me hope
you'd actually make it here.

01:11:40.397 --> 01:11:42.430
What is here?

01:11:42.431 --> 01:11:44.464
My marriage is on the rocks,
I probably lost my job.

01:11:44.467 --> 01:11:48.369
Please, tell me...
that this is worth it.

01:11:48.371 --> 01:11:50.071
Most certainly, professor.

01:11:50.073 --> 01:11:53.308
This is the noblest of causes.

01:11:53.310 --> 01:11:56.711
For people like us,
this is the Holy Grail.

01:11:58.548 --> 01:12:01.716
Uh, well, bad analogy.

01:12:01.718 --> 01:12:04.485
That old trinket is lying on
a shelf in here somewhere.

01:12:05.689 --> 01:12:07.755
I've spent the last decade

01:12:07.757 --> 01:12:10.525
unlocking the secrets
of this place,

01:12:10.527 --> 01:12:14.629
but, with your help, we'll
finally finish what I started.

01:12:14.631 --> 01:12:15.863
Not a decade.

01:12:16.900 --> 01:12:18.900
It's only been three years.

01:12:21.671 --> 01:12:24.806
Hmm, I always wondered
what would happen to time.

01:12:32.916 --> 01:12:34.015
Feel that?

01:12:34.017 --> 01:12:38.920
That's the power of real
change, real alchemy.

01:12:39.923 --> 01:12:42.357
Alchemy, really?

01:12:42.359 --> 01:12:44.792
All those references
to affirmative action

01:12:44.794 --> 01:12:45.960
will seem so quaint

01:12:45.962 --> 01:12:49.964
after we quite literally
change the world.

01:12:50.867 --> 01:12:54.802
I think we're beyond
departmental bullshit, don't you?

01:12:56.005 --> 01:12:59.440
When you said it was us against
the world, you weren't wrong.

01:13:00.377 --> 01:13:03.611
We stuck together and
now we have this.

01:13:03.613 --> 01:13:04.979
Oh...

01:13:04.981 --> 01:13:07.548
<i>The Alchemical</i>
<i>Manuscript</i> -- you--

01:13:07.550 --> 01:13:08.816
Oh, my!

01:13:08.818 --> 01:13:10.485
You translated it.

01:13:11.855 --> 01:13:13.554
Funny story about that--

01:13:14.891 --> 01:13:17.091
When I said it was
a stroke of luck

01:13:17.093 --> 01:13:20.495
that whoever dug it up
didn't know what they had...

01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:25.666
It was a trap.

01:13:25.668 --> 01:13:27.635
Someone on the same
road as you and I

01:13:27.637 --> 01:13:31.439
just waiting to see
who'd take the bait.

01:13:32.475 --> 01:13:33.641
Someone--

01:13:35.645 --> 01:13:36.744
Colton!

01:13:37.981 --> 01:13:39.714
You know the bastard?

01:13:39.716 --> 01:13:41.616
He's not rotting in hell?

01:13:42.485 --> 01:13:43.751
Close enough though.

01:13:43.753 --> 01:13:45.653
He's in an asylum.

01:13:45.655 --> 01:13:46.988
He's not doing very well.

01:13:51.494 --> 01:13:52.693
He's lucky.

01:13:55.432 --> 01:13:59.667
I've translated every word
in here a hundred times.

01:13:59.669 --> 01:14:02.670
I'm ready to take
the final step,

01:14:03.807 --> 01:14:06.607
but you-- you were
always stronger at this.

01:14:06.609 --> 01:14:08.509
That's why I brought
you here, professor.

01:14:08.511 --> 01:14:09.844
I'm guessing at some
of the meanings,

01:14:09.846 --> 01:14:11.879
but we only get one chance.

01:14:11.881 --> 01:14:13.581
At what? What's the point?

01:14:13.583 --> 01:14:14.949
Read it.

01:14:15.885 --> 01:14:19.120
If you can perfect my
translations, then you'll see.

01:14:19.122 --> 01:14:20.955
And so will everybody else.

01:14:23.660 --> 01:14:25.893
We have a situation, Mr. Ramdas.

01:14:34.003 --> 01:14:35.069
Hmm.

01:14:37.507 --> 01:14:40.241
I'll let you get to work.

01:14:42.879 --> 01:14:44.846
We're so close, my old friend.

01:15:06.536 --> 01:15:08.970
My God! Dawn!

01:15:10.039 --> 01:15:11.939
I never thought
I'd see you again.

01:15:11.941 --> 01:15:15.743
Sanjay, untie me before that
woman comes back again.

01:15:18.147 --> 01:15:19.514
What is happening?

01:15:23.686 --> 01:15:25.620
Don't worry about her.

01:15:25.622 --> 01:15:28.556
- But--
- Dawn, you are safe.

01:15:28.558 --> 01:15:31.192
I promise you. And so is Sam.

01:15:31.194 --> 01:15:32.660
She's working on
something right now.

01:15:32.662 --> 01:15:34.228
It's very important.

01:15:34.230 --> 01:15:35.830
Take me to her. I
need to talk to her.

01:15:35.832 --> 01:15:36.998
She's really busy, Dawn.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:38.699
I don't think it's
the right time.

01:15:40.003 --> 01:15:42.136
She hurt someone
in the hospital.

01:15:42.138 --> 01:15:44.705
I need to speak to her.

01:15:44.707 --> 01:15:45.740
Dawn,

01:15:45.742 --> 01:15:51.245
I really think you should
come back at another time.

01:15:57.053 --> 01:15:58.252
Take me to her.

01:16:04.060 --> 01:16:04.992
Yeah.

01:16:06.863 --> 01:16:07.795
Of course.

01:16:09.766 --> 01:16:10.865
Right this way.

01:16:25.048 --> 01:16:29.183
I see why you never told me
what you were doing here.

01:16:29.185 --> 01:16:31.152
Would you have done all this
if you would have known?

01:16:32.822 --> 01:16:35.056
I don't think we were
meant to do this, Sanjay.

01:16:35.058 --> 01:16:37.858
It was locked in there
for a reason, right?

01:16:37.860 --> 01:16:39.126
This entity thought--

01:16:39.128 --> 01:16:43.297
You speak of our God, professor.

01:16:43.299 --> 01:16:45.800
This is literally
infinite knowledge.

01:16:45.802 --> 01:16:48.603
All the world's problems could
be solved in an instant.

01:16:48.605 --> 01:16:51.939
All we have to do is let that
knowledge into our world,

01:16:51.941 --> 01:16:56.844
to allow humanity to evolve in
the footsteps of the scribe.

01:16:56.846 --> 01:16:59.013
But we don't know what it means.

01:16:59.015 --> 01:17:01.382
We don't have any idea
what the costs might be.

01:17:01.384 --> 01:17:03.784
Professor, we could
achieve world peace,

01:17:04.621 --> 01:17:05.786
an end to disease,

01:17:05.788 --> 01:17:09.090
anything we can imagine

01:17:09.092 --> 01:17:10.825
and much more that we can't.

01:17:11.694 --> 01:17:16.864
This is the patron of
science and wisdom.

01:17:16.866 --> 01:17:20.668
It's a God, Sanjay, your words.

01:17:21.871 --> 01:17:24.672
We don't know what this entails.

01:17:24.674 --> 01:17:26.641
What happened to
careful scholarship?

01:17:28.277 --> 01:17:31.278
Science harnessed the
power of the atom,

01:17:34.917 --> 01:17:38.653
but science brought us to
the brink of nuclear war.

01:17:38.655 --> 01:17:40.354
- How is that any different?
- Did you read this?

01:17:42.091 --> 01:17:43.157
All of it?

01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:46.227
Did anything in there scare you?

01:17:48.197 --> 01:17:52.767
This is our chance to advance
human society into a golden egg.

01:17:59.409 --> 01:18:00.408
You--

01:18:02.078 --> 01:18:03.778
You finished the translation.

01:18:06.382 --> 01:18:08.916
It was the only way to
know what it meant.

01:18:08.918 --> 01:18:10.184
I had to finish it.

01:18:10.186 --> 01:18:12.186
My God, professor.

01:18:12.188 --> 01:18:14.155
You've given the
world a great gift.

01:18:15.358 --> 01:18:16.290
Sanjay,

01:18:17.226 --> 01:18:18.759
you're hurt.

01:18:18.761 --> 01:18:19.960
It's nothing.

01:18:20.997 --> 01:18:22.830
Just a little blood.

01:18:22.832 --> 01:18:24.398
That's a lot of blood.

01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:25.833
No time.

01:18:27.804 --> 01:18:28.936
Let's begin.

01:18:30.106 --> 01:18:31.739
What are you not telling me?

01:18:34.310 --> 01:18:36.243
That woman that came in...

01:18:36.245 --> 01:18:37.378
What happened?

01:18:40.983 --> 01:18:42.483
What did you do?

01:18:53.930 --> 01:18:55.496
What happened to you?

01:19:14.350 --> 01:19:16.317
Ah, professor!

01:19:17.353 --> 01:19:19.186
You should return
to the theatre.

01:19:19.188 --> 01:19:20.154
What happened?

01:19:20.156 --> 01:19:24.492
What was the situation that
you mentioned to Sanjay?

01:19:24.494 --> 01:19:26.927
Return to the theatre, now!

01:19:26.929 --> 01:19:28.529
Answer my fucking question!

01:19:30.166 --> 01:19:32.533
Very well then, right this way.

01:20:25.288 --> 01:20:27.488
Oh, you're not supposed
to be in here.

01:20:27.490 --> 01:20:29.957
Get back! Get the fuck back!

01:20:29.959 --> 01:20:33.093
Get back! Stay away!

01:20:33.095 --> 01:20:34.461
Oh, my God!

01:20:34.463 --> 01:20:36.297
Oh, my God! No... You!

01:20:36.299 --> 01:20:40.201
What did you do?
What did you do?

01:20:40.203 --> 01:20:41.435
Oh, my God!

01:20:41.437 --> 01:20:43.304
Oh, my God!

01:20:44.473 --> 01:20:46.240
No, no...

01:20:50.112 --> 01:20:51.212
Why?

01:20:52.114 --> 01:20:54.415
Oh, God!

01:20:55.985 --> 01:20:57.218
No!

01:20:57.220 --> 01:20:59.854
No... No...

01:21:01.324 --> 01:21:04.058
Wake up. Please, wake up.

01:21:05.161 --> 01:21:07.161
I love you.

01:21:08.097 --> 01:21:10.097
Wake up, just wake up.

01:21:10.099 --> 01:21:11.565
Please, baby, wake up.

01:21:11.567 --> 01:21:13.467
No!

01:21:19.475 --> 01:21:21.008
I'm sorry.

01:21:21.878 --> 01:21:23.010
I'm so sorry.

01:21:27.183 --> 01:21:28.115
You!

01:21:30.586 --> 01:21:32.987
You! You!

01:21:32.989 --> 01:21:34.655
Did you do this?

01:21:34.657 --> 01:21:36.156
No, no, no, no.

01:21:36.158 --> 01:21:38.592
Who did this? Tell me now.

01:21:38.594 --> 01:21:41.629
Your student was in here
and he came out of...

01:21:41.631 --> 01:21:43.030
If you--

01:21:43.966 --> 01:21:45.900
If you touch her body,

01:21:45.902 --> 01:21:47.902
if you start

01:21:47.903 --> 01:21:49.903
whatever the fucking hell
ritual you were doing,

01:21:49.906 --> 01:21:51.906
if you start it again,

01:21:51.908 --> 01:21:53.140
I'm going to come up here

01:21:54.443 --> 01:21:56.577
and I am going to
do worse to you

01:21:56.579 --> 01:21:59.380
than I did to the
guard downstairs.

01:21:59.382 --> 01:22:00.948
Do you understand?

01:22:00.950 --> 01:22:02.917
What did you do to the guard?

01:22:02.919 --> 01:22:03.918
What did you do to her?

01:22:06.589 --> 01:22:07.554
Go look.

01:22:10.326 --> 01:22:11.258
Go look.

01:22:27.076 --> 01:22:28.242
I love you.

01:22:36.352 --> 01:22:37.618
Oh, God!

01:22:53.970 --> 01:22:55.536
Oh, Dawn...

01:22:57.440 --> 01:22:59.073
I'm sorry.

01:23:00.643 --> 01:23:02.042
I'm sorry.

01:23:24.266 --> 01:23:25.699
You killed her!

01:23:25.701 --> 01:23:27.001
How could you?

01:23:27.003 --> 01:23:29.203
How could you do that to her?

01:23:29.205 --> 01:23:30.270
To me?

01:23:30.272 --> 01:23:34.008
Dawn, she cared for you.

01:23:34.010 --> 01:23:39.513
She cared for you and
you killed her for what?

01:23:46.088 --> 01:23:48.422
My
students, come and drink

01:23:48.424 --> 01:23:52.059
the sweetest nectar
which is true knowledge.

01:23:52.061 --> 01:23:55.362
Yes, we humbly offer
ourselves to you,

01:23:55.364 --> 01:23:56.663
who knows the two lands.

01:23:56.665 --> 01:23:58.532
The machinery of this reality

01:23:58.534 --> 01:24:01.735
lies rusted and
choked with dust.

01:24:01.737 --> 01:24:04.772
We shall reawaken
it to its purpose.

01:24:04.774 --> 01:24:06.440
Sanjay, you can't
let this happen.

01:24:06.442 --> 01:24:07.541
You have to stop it.

01:24:07.543 --> 01:24:09.276
Do you know nothing?

01:24:09.278 --> 01:24:11.445
We are before the--

01:24:11.447 --> 01:24:15.049
Let the become my,

01:24:15.051 --> 01:24:16.583
oh, self-begotten.

01:24:16.585 --> 01:24:19.787
Into this
land of shadows and smoke,

01:24:19.789 --> 01:24:24.324
we shall pour the
cold light of truth.

01:24:27.163 --> 01:24:28.362
No!

01:24:29.565 --> 01:24:30.497
No.

01:24:34.203 --> 01:24:36.737
No! No!

01:24:38.307 --> 01:24:39.406
Sanjay...

01:24:42.645 --> 01:24:45.779
Sanjay, this isn't you!

01:24:45.781 --> 01:24:49.817
No, why would you do it?

01:24:49.819 --> 01:24:53.287
No, what happened to you?

01:24:53.289 --> 01:24:55.789
What happened to the
guy who talked Dawn

01:24:55.791 --> 01:24:58.158
into making donuts at 3 a.m.

01:24:58.160 --> 01:25:01.428
while we were translating
some stupid pointless books?

01:25:01.430 --> 01:25:03.630
Remember, remember when those--

01:25:03.632 --> 01:25:06.834
when those stupid racist
fucks jumped you?

01:25:06.836 --> 01:25:09.470
And I maced them? I maced them.

01:25:10.372 --> 01:25:12.606
And when they came up and said

01:25:12.608 --> 01:25:16.110
that they were really
going to fuck me straight

01:25:16.112 --> 01:25:19.780
and you stopped them?

01:25:19.782 --> 01:25:21.882
And then you walked me home

01:25:21.884 --> 01:25:25.619
and you stayed with
me until I was okay?

01:25:26.689 --> 01:25:29.289
Please, remember...

01:25:30.793 --> 01:25:35.496
"Us against the world," right?

01:25:45.307 --> 01:25:46.373
Sam!

01:25:49.912 --> 01:25:50.911
Sam!

01:25:53.749 --> 01:25:54.748
I'm sorry!

01:25:55.851 --> 01:25:56.783
I--

01:25:58.254 --> 01:25:59.219
I--

01:26:00.856 --> 01:26:02.289
I killed them.

01:26:05.594 --> 01:26:09.429
So many people died.

01:26:11.300 --> 01:26:12.900
It's inside me.

01:26:17.940 --> 01:26:19.239
I can't.

01:26:21.477 --> 01:26:25.546
No! No!

01:26:25.548 --> 01:26:28.649
No! Oh, God!

01:26:30.452 --> 01:26:31.952
I'm sorry.

01:26:32.821 --> 01:26:36.323
No! No!

01:26:36.325 --> 01:26:38.926
No! No!

01:26:38.928 --> 01:26:40.194
It's okay.

01:26:48.370 --> 01:26:49.536
I'm sorry.

01:26:53.409 --> 01:26:55.209
I love you, old friend.

01:27:15.998 --> 01:27:18.532
Thank you, Sam.

01:27:21.870 --> 01:27:22.803
You...

01:27:25.007 --> 01:27:26.306
are always...

01:27:28.744 --> 01:27:29.977
Smarter.

01:28:46.689 --> 01:28:47.888
Ah, Miss Bishop!

01:28:48.757 --> 01:28:50.490
Please, come in.

01:28:50.492 --> 01:28:52.926
I'll just grab my keys.

01:28:52.927 --> 01:28:55.361
Actually, um, I'm here
to see Samantha Rand.

01:28:55.364 --> 01:28:56.663
Professor Rand?

01:28:57.499 --> 01:29:02.035
Ah, yes, well, she's not
in the best of conditions.

01:29:02.037 --> 01:29:03.403
I, uh--

01:29:08.977 --> 01:29:10.711
Of course.

01:29:10.713 --> 01:29:12.112
If you'll just follow me.

01:29:16.518 --> 01:29:17.818
Oh, my God...

01:29:20.489 --> 01:29:21.888
Professor?

01:29:21.890 --> 01:29:24.591
It takes everything

01:29:24.593 --> 01:29:26.393
for a bit of knowledge.

01:29:27.463 --> 01:29:30.697
It takes everything, everything

01:29:30.699 --> 01:29:32.933
for a bit of knowledge.
Everything.

01:29:32.935 --> 01:29:34.534
That's
about all she says.

01:29:35.771 --> 01:29:37.471
Compulsive repetition.

01:29:42.044 --> 01:29:44.711
It takes everything for
a bit of knowledge.

01:29:44.713 --> 01:29:47.881
Everything, everything.

01:29:47.883 --> 01:29:49.916
Professor, can you hear me?

01:29:49.918 --> 01:29:52.085
Is there anything that
I can do for you?

01:29:58.594 --> 01:29:59.693
I'm so sorry.

01:30:20.783 --> 01:30:24.785
It takes everything, everything.

01:30:24.787 --> 01:30:28.054
Takes, takes, takes, everything.

01:30:30.426 --> 01:30:33.827
Takes everything for
a bit of knowledge.

01:30:36.598 --> 01:30:37.998

He's been more
animated, more lucid.

01:33:13.255 --> 01:33:16.222
It's too early to hope for
a breakthrough, but...

01:33:16.224 --> 01:33:18.758
I stopped hoping for
that a long time ago.

01:33:23.298 --> 01:33:24.864
You're a real bastard,
you know that?

01:33:24.866 --> 01:33:27.968
Chloe, you were raised better
than to speak that way.

01:33:27.970 --> 01:33:30.804
Her wife is dead and she's now
in a padded cell down the hall.

01:33:30.806 --> 01:33:32.706
Does that even matter to you?
Does that even register?

01:33:32.708 --> 01:33:34.207
Yes.

01:33:34.209 --> 01:33:35.709
Look, I feel...

01:33:36.678 --> 01:33:40.180
deep gratitude for both
of them and for you.

01:33:40.182 --> 01:33:42.749
I cannot be more proud of you.

01:33:43.652 --> 01:33:47.087
Chloe, you've done
a good thing here.

01:33:47.089 --> 01:33:49.022
Do you understand me?

01:33:49.024 --> 01:33:51.291
We've laid one more stone on
the path to enlightenment.

01:33:51.293 --> 01:33:55.028
To expect anything
else would be hubris.

01:33:55.030 --> 01:33:55.996
Chloe...

01:33:58.233 --> 01:33:59.232
Look at me.

01:34:02.037 --> 01:34:04.337
Don't mourn too long.

01:34:04.339 --> 01:34:08.008
This falls on you, to send the
next seeker on their path.
