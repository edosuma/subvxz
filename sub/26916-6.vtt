WEBVTT

00:14.120 --> 00:16.560
[Uhtred] I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred.

00:16.640 --> 00:19.640
Brida told me of my brother's murder.

00:19.720 --> 00:20.880
Ragnar is dead!

00:20.960 --> 00:22.800
He doesn't feast in Valhalla!

00:22.880 --> 00:26.320
Instead, he lies under a pile of stones
at the lake near Loidis!

00:26.920 --> 00:29.800
[Uhtred] He died because
I remain cursed by Skade.

00:31.920 --> 00:33.760
[Finan] Death comes to us all.

00:34.240 --> 00:35.320
It is her.

00:35.400 --> 00:38.480
[Uhtred] To help him cross the bridge
from Hel to Valhalla,

00:39.040 --> 00:40.840
I must first be rid of her.

00:41.400 --> 00:44.320
To fight Haesten's army,
you will need an army.

00:44.400 --> 00:46.920
My father is to join the Mercians
at Aegelesburg.

00:47.000 --> 00:51.280
[Uhtred] So, with Aethelflaed, I journeyed
to King Alfred, to plead for help.

00:51.360 --> 00:53.920
One thousand men
and I will give you Beamfleot.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.400
I do not need Beamfleot.

00:55.480 --> 00:57.200
[Uhtred] When Alfred denied me,

00:57.280 --> 01:01.000
his son, the aetheling Edward,
promised soldiers.

01:01.080 --> 01:03.320
Set a day for the attack
and I will be there.

01:03.400 --> 01:05.360
You shall have the men.

01:05.440 --> 01:08.720
[Uhtred] With that assurance,
I drew Haesten to the battlefield...

01:08.800 --> 01:09.640
Run!

01:09.720 --> 01:12.040
...and into our trap, where we expected

01:12.120 --> 01:15.440
the king and his men,
who lay in wait, to strike.

01:15.520 --> 01:16.360
We wait.

01:18.280 --> 01:21.520
-Lord, where is Alfred's army?
-[men shouting]

01:21.600 --> 01:23.440
They're being slaughtered!

01:23.520 --> 01:25.160
We hold our position.

01:25.240 --> 01:26.440
[all grunting]

01:32.200 --> 01:35.320
We cannot just stand by
and watch them die!

01:35.400 --> 01:37.920
-I gave him my word!
-Then what will you do, boy?

01:38.000 --> 01:40.680
You can either bleat
or you can make a decision!

01:41.800 --> 01:42.760
What will you do?

01:43.800 --> 01:45.520
[Uhtred] Destiny is all!

01:50.080 --> 01:50.920
[sighs]

01:52.920 --> 01:55.920
Lord King, we cannot wait any longer!

01:57.280 --> 01:58.480
Lord King!

02:00.560 --> 02:01.720
[exhales deeply]

02:05.360 --> 02:06.440
[grunting]

02:08.720 --> 02:09.919
[men shouting]

02:13.080 --> 02:15.520
Father! We cannot wait!

02:15.600 --> 02:16.520
We cannot!

02:24.160 --> 02:25.640
For Wessex!

02:25.720 --> 02:29.200
And for the king!

02:29.280 --> 02:30.800
For the king!

02:30.880 --> 02:31.960
[soldiers yelling]

02:37.960 --> 02:39.640
[yelling]

02:43.680 --> 02:46.000
Edward! It's Edward and his army!

02:46.080 --> 02:47.040
[screams]

03:00.880 --> 03:03.920
Stand! Every man is to stand!

03:06.520 --> 03:08.760
Dagfinn! Every man is to stand!

03:14.040 --> 03:14.880
[Skade] It's Alfred.

03:15.600 --> 03:16.640
He lives.

03:19.200 --> 03:24.120
Stand! Every man is to stand!

03:28.720 --> 03:30.120
Stand!

03:30.200 --> 03:32.480
She's why we're here, Lord! Take her!

03:36.760 --> 03:37.960
[screams]

03:42.640 --> 03:44.320
[all grunting]

03:55.240 --> 03:56.880
-[horse neighs]
-No!

04:10.880 --> 04:12.480
No!

04:23.640 --> 04:25.600
[yelling]

04:29.040 --> 04:31.040
[theme music playing]

05:09.040 --> 05:09.880
[caws]

05:12.400 --> 05:13.560
[men grunting]

05:24.400 --> 05:25.560
[Sihtric] Lord!

05:27.440 --> 05:28.440
It's Osferth.

05:30.560 --> 05:31.920
[coughing]

05:36.280 --> 05:37.320
Osferth?

05:37.400 --> 05:41.280
He's alive, Lord.
Maybe next time we'll be lucky, eh?

05:41.360 --> 05:45.160
-Did you see me fighting, Lord?
-I did.

05:45.240 --> 05:46.520
It was a sight to behold.

05:46.600 --> 05:48.400
I hope I killed no man. [grunts]

05:48.480 --> 05:50.240
You gave many a sore head.

05:51.640 --> 05:52.800
I feel cold.

05:52.880 --> 05:54.920
Because it's winter, you fool.

05:57.720 --> 06:00.080
You were a warrior today, Osferth.

06:00.640 --> 06:01.760
Am I to die, Lord?

06:02.440 --> 06:03.600
I do not fear it.

06:03.680 --> 06:04.720
I forbid it.

06:05.280 --> 06:08.240
You dare die, baby monk,
and I'll kill you myself.

06:09.360 --> 06:10.960
Right. I'll try not to, then.

06:12.960 --> 06:16.080
We will return to Aethelflaed's estate.
You will recover there.

06:16.720 --> 06:17.840
Yes, Lord.

06:17.920 --> 06:19.120
What of Skade?

06:20.520 --> 06:22.120
She's been taken by Haesten.

06:24.120 --> 06:26.880
Then nothing has changed.
We remain cursed still.

06:27.560 --> 06:28.720
I am cursed.

06:29.880 --> 06:31.160
It touches us all, Lord.

06:33.640 --> 06:34.680
It continues.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.240
[door opens]

06:50.440 --> 06:52.600
[Steapa] Uhtred, Lord. As you ordered.

06:54.440 --> 06:56.080
[Alfred] Thank you, Steapa.

06:58.640 --> 07:01.960
I assume your vengeance included
reclaiming the seer, Skade?

07:02.040 --> 07:03.680
She is why you are here?

07:03.760 --> 07:05.880
Instead, I reclaimed your fortress, Lord.

07:05.960 --> 07:08.560
The victory was decisive.
You have my thanks.

07:09.160 --> 07:11.120
I feared you would not join the battle.

07:11.200 --> 07:13.320
I was tempted to wait a little longer.

07:13.400 --> 07:17.120
I would've seen victory without you.
It would have been all you deserved.

07:21.640 --> 07:24.640
It was Edward who ordered the attack.
It needed to be Edward.

07:25.480 --> 07:26.720
You owe him your thanks.

07:27.920 --> 07:29.240
He fought with courage.

07:33.720 --> 07:35.720
If I were his father, I would be proud.

07:42.240 --> 07:46.320
When I spoke with Skade, she foretold
I should not live to see another summer.

07:47.640 --> 07:49.760
Skade preys on men's fears, Lord.

07:49.840 --> 07:51.640
Nevertheless, I know it to be true.

07:52.680 --> 07:55.920
I know how my body weakens daily.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.960
In a matter of months,
weeks even, I shall be gone,

07:59.720 --> 08:01.560
and Edward shall be king.

08:02.760 --> 08:04.040
He has proven himself.

08:04.120 --> 08:05.920
He has proven that he has courage...

08:07.480 --> 08:09.480
but also that he can be manipulated.

08:09.560 --> 08:12.520
You used him to serve your own purpose.

08:12.600 --> 08:15.000
No, Lord, he saw a way to weaken an enemy.

08:15.080 --> 08:18.200
The Danes' march was halted.
They will not attack this winter.

08:20.200 --> 08:23.960
You do your son a disservice,
all to accuse me of manipulation!

08:28.560 --> 08:32.240
For one reason or another, you have,
it seems, earned Edward's favor.

08:32.320 --> 08:33.600
He kept his word.

08:34.240 --> 08:35.080
Yes.

08:35.159 --> 08:38.760
All that I ask is that
you do not forget what he has done.

08:39.320 --> 08:40.720
Oh, I will not forget.

08:41.840 --> 08:46.040
Nor will I forget that his father has
taken from me everything that was mine.

08:46.120 --> 08:50.040
You are free to go anywhere but Wessex,
Bebbanburg should you choose,

08:50.720 --> 08:53.720
but those lands are as distant as ever.

08:57.760 --> 08:59.440
As is England, Lord.

09:03.040 --> 09:05.400
The Danes will never leave these shores.

09:06.320 --> 09:07.320
Never.

09:10.960 --> 09:13.320
I will go to
the Lady Aethelflaed's estate.

09:14.120 --> 09:16.000
She remains in danger, I believe.

09:18.440 --> 09:19.920
Lord King.

09:36.680 --> 09:37.680
[indistinct chatter]

09:45.000 --> 09:47.080
Fetch me Cnut. He needs to see this.

10:08.360 --> 10:10.640
Haesten looks a broken man.

10:10.720 --> 10:12.640
[Bloodhair] He looks like shit.

10:12.720 --> 10:14.520
He brings my woman.

10:26.240 --> 10:27.120
[Skade grunting]

10:30.280 --> 10:32.360
-Lord Haesten, my friend.
-[Haesten] Cnut.

10:36.120 --> 10:36.960
[sighs]

10:37.040 --> 10:39.600
[Haesten] Point your cock
somewhere else, Bloodhair.

10:39.680 --> 10:41.840
The woman is mine, make no mistake.

10:44.320 --> 10:45.280
What has happened?

10:45.360 --> 10:48.640
[sighs] I have lost everything,
bar what you see.

10:49.360 --> 10:51.160
You've lost more than half your men.

10:51.240 --> 10:52.920
-And my man, Dagfinn.
-How?

10:53.000 --> 10:57.080
Alfred lives, that is how.
They came at night in their thousands.

10:57.160 --> 10:59.400
-He lives?
-And Uhtred is with him.

10:59.480 --> 11:00.720
Who says Alfred lives?

11:00.800 --> 11:02.280
I say.

11:02.360 --> 11:05.280
I saw him on horseback,
as strong as he has ever been.

11:05.360 --> 11:07.080
That is a nonsense. It must be.

11:07.160 --> 11:08.520
He lives!

11:10.240 --> 11:11.840
And half my men do not!

11:11.920 --> 11:15.280
If Uhtred is with Alfred,
then it is over before it has begun.

11:15.360 --> 11:19.560
Nothing is over. Nothing is over!
We are strong still!

11:19.640 --> 11:22.080
-How'd you come by Skade?
-Skade's not important.

11:22.160 --> 11:23.600
Haesten spared Uhtred.

11:23.680 --> 11:24.960
You will shut your mouth!

11:25.040 --> 11:25.920
It's true.

11:26.600 --> 11:28.000
We do not care.

11:28.080 --> 11:30.560
He could've easily killed Uhtred
and the princess,

11:30.640 --> 11:32.640
but instead, he desired me.

11:32.720 --> 11:34.960
He thinks with his cock.

11:35.040 --> 11:36.960
-[chuckles]
-You find that amusing?

11:37.040 --> 11:38.920
I've missed her sharp tongue.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.640
She is mine. I will lose nothing more!

11:41.720 --> 11:44.000
We are meant to be one army.

11:44.560 --> 11:45.680
Haesten, rest.

11:45.760 --> 11:49.440
Then the three of us shall sit and decide
how we are to proceed.

11:49.520 --> 11:51.040
A war council.

11:51.120 --> 11:52.160
You mean four of us?

11:52.240 --> 11:55.440
Aethelwold, another word from you
and I shall take your head.

11:55.520 --> 11:56.760
Very well.

11:58.040 --> 11:59.760
[softly] Not another word.

12:09.400 --> 12:10.560
[Osferth coughing]

12:21.080 --> 12:23.080
[indistinct chatter and laughter]

12:52.880 --> 12:54.480
You have no appetite?

12:56.080 --> 12:58.080
No appetite for celebration.

12:58.160 --> 13:00.000
What is it you are holding?

13:00.680 --> 13:01.640
Thor's hammer.

13:03.600 --> 13:04.440
Yes.

13:05.520 --> 13:06.840
From Ragnar the Fearless.

13:07.840 --> 13:08.760
I have told you?

13:09.840 --> 13:11.000
Once or twice.

13:14.840 --> 13:16.440
They will be together now...

13:17.640 --> 13:19.400
father and son, in Valhalla.

13:19.480 --> 13:21.760
That is what you believe, isn't it?

13:24.720 --> 13:25.960
I must go to him.

13:26.560 --> 13:28.040
My men will remain here.

13:33.120 --> 13:36.800
Uhtred, I know what you have
sacrificed to come to my aid.

13:38.080 --> 13:39.680
I know how much it has cost you.

13:40.200 --> 13:42.200
It was my choice, Lady.

13:43.280 --> 13:44.880
It is what I wanted to do.

13:49.560 --> 13:51.760
I would like you
to have Mercia as your home,

13:51.840 --> 13:53.440
to live here with your men.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.600
I can identify land--

13:57.680 --> 14:00.280
Thank you, Lady,
but say nothing more. Please.

14:02.960 --> 14:03.800
[man shouting]

14:06.520 --> 14:08.320
Where are the prisoners being taken?

14:08.400 --> 14:10.600
To the hall, to be fed upon my orders.

14:11.240 --> 14:13.200
Come join us, Lady Aethelflaed--

14:13.280 --> 14:16.160
Hold your tongue, Dagfinn,
or I will cut it out!

14:17.360 --> 14:20.880
I do not like my enemies within my walls.

14:22.160 --> 14:23.720
I will leave you to your peace.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
[door opens]

14:35.080 --> 14:36.640
How's Osferth?

14:37.200 --> 14:40.040
Sleeping. As we should all be.

14:44.000 --> 14:47.920
Just as soon as he's recovered,
we should attempt to recover Skade.

14:48.000 --> 14:48.840
Once again.

14:48.920 --> 14:52.280
So long as she is free, Lord,
you are cursed.

14:52.360 --> 14:54.960
Skade is with the Danes.
We cannot reach her.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.800
We will not chase her to our deaths.

14:59.400 --> 15:00.960
Death will find us regardless.

15:03.720 --> 15:06.520
-Do you have something to say, Sihtric?
-He does not.

15:06.600 --> 15:08.720
Except that enough of us
have died already.

15:08.800 --> 15:11.080
[Finan] You are a warrior.
Death is a hazard.

15:16.200 --> 15:19.520
I've decided to go to Ragnar.
I must help him find peace.

15:19.600 --> 15:22.280
All you will find
at Ragnar's graveside is ghosts.

15:30.080 --> 15:32.680
You will keep watch of Aethelflaed
and you will rest.

15:37.760 --> 15:42.120
No man who serves Uhtred can rest,
not until Skade is reclaimed.

15:42.200 --> 15:44.520
[Finan] Sihtric, you are drunk and tired.

15:44.600 --> 15:46.280
Yes, I am tired...

15:46.880 --> 15:49.720
of marching north and then south,
being called a traitor,

15:49.800 --> 15:51.240
of abandoning my wife!

15:51.320 --> 15:52.360
For what?

15:53.000 --> 15:55.120
-Then leave.
-[Finan] You don't mean that.

15:55.200 --> 15:57.680
If you are unhappy in my service, leave!

15:57.760 --> 15:59.240
I have fought for you!

16:00.240 --> 16:02.080
You fight because you enjoy it.

16:02.160 --> 16:03.680
You'd dismiss me this easily?

16:03.760 --> 16:05.240
Stay or go, I do not care.

16:05.320 --> 16:10.120
He does not mean that. He does care.
Now, let us all sit.

16:11.760 --> 16:15.040
Stay or go, Sihtric Kjartanson.
It is your choice.

16:16.040 --> 16:16.880
Make it!

16:20.320 --> 16:23.880
If you wish to make the square,
Uhtred of Bebbanburg, let us do it.

16:23.960 --> 16:27.160
No, there'll be no squares made,
no fighting, just sleep!

16:28.560 --> 16:29.760
Sleep!

16:32.320 --> 16:33.280
Jesus!

16:34.160 --> 16:36.960
Get the prisoners back
with the pigs, bound.

16:37.040 --> 16:38.120
Sihtric!

16:41.160 --> 16:42.640
I will leave first light...

16:44.000 --> 16:45.560
but I will return.

16:45.640 --> 16:47.240
And if you are here still...

16:49.120 --> 16:50.760
then I will kill you.

17:04.319 --> 17:05.160
Why?

17:06.359 --> 17:08.040
-[grunts]
-[clatters]

17:08.119 --> 17:09.839
He has cursed us all!

17:14.040 --> 17:17.760
She has cursed you all
and Uhtred allows it.

17:17.839 --> 17:19.040
Shut your mouth.

17:20.359 --> 17:22.800
Abandon him, boy.
It's your only chance.

17:23.359 --> 17:26.599
You're a Dane first and last.

17:26.680 --> 17:28.240
-[soldier] Quiet!
-[grunts]

17:29.920 --> 17:30.760
[groans]

17:36.040 --> 17:39.040
You abandoned your fortress
and your men abandoned you.

17:40.880 --> 17:41.840
Some.

17:42.520 --> 17:43.920
You fell into Alfred's trap.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.080
I was told that Alfred was dead.

17:46.960 --> 17:48.080
By your messenger.

17:48.160 --> 17:49.560
The trap was Uhtred's.

17:52.000 --> 17:55.960
Alfred brought his armies to Beamfleot
because that is what Uhtred asked of him.

17:57.200 --> 17:59.800
Alfred will die soon enough,
but Uhtred we want dead.

17:59.880 --> 18:02.520
He should have died at Dunholm,
but Ragnar was weak.

18:02.600 --> 18:06.200
If we are to make Wessex ours,
we must rid it of its talisman.

18:06.280 --> 18:08.320
Uhtred of Bebbanburg must die.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.080
The days are short.

18:10.960 --> 18:14.200
We've been weakened,
and Ragnar's death is an omen.

18:14.280 --> 18:15.840
Wessex must wait.

18:20.760 --> 18:22.880
Aethelwold, you will return to Winchester.

18:24.240 --> 18:25.600
I cannot.

18:25.680 --> 18:26.680
I will not.

18:28.200 --> 18:29.080
For what reason?

18:29.160 --> 18:32.240
It's time to deliver us
your long-promised Saxon army.

18:32.320 --> 18:33.840
Once Alfred is dead, yes.

18:34.520 --> 18:37.400
Aethelred is ripe for betrayal,
as are many men of Wessex,

18:37.480 --> 18:39.520
but as a corpse, I can do nothing.

18:39.600 --> 18:40.680
Alfred would kill me.

18:40.760 --> 18:43.040
-Ask for forgiveness.
-I would be ignored.

18:43.120 --> 18:44.480
Then you will beg!

18:47.320 --> 18:49.000
You will deliver me a Saxon army,

18:49.080 --> 18:51.680
and if Uhtred has joined
Alfred at Winchester,

18:51.760 --> 18:53.000
you will kill him.

18:53.720 --> 18:55.360
I will kill him, how?

18:55.440 --> 18:56.920
As you killed Ragnar.

18:58.800 --> 19:00.000
Lord... [chuckles]

19:05.560 --> 19:07.520
[Haesten] He wouldn't have the balls.

19:09.080 --> 19:11.800
Lord Cnut, you must learn
to hold your tongue.

19:14.200 --> 19:15.880
This fool killed Ragnar?

19:16.720 --> 19:18.360
Cnut is joking with you.

19:18.440 --> 19:19.640
While he slept.

19:20.280 --> 19:21.960
He was not sleeping.

19:26.640 --> 19:28.640
It was either he died or I died.

19:29.600 --> 19:30.640
I am no fool.

19:32.240 --> 19:34.880
This fact goes no further than this table.

19:34.960 --> 19:36.600
Are you part of this?

19:37.200 --> 19:39.080
I'm no longer concerned by his death.

19:39.720 --> 19:41.000
You wish to lead?

19:41.080 --> 19:44.200
Ragnar should never have allowed
Uhtred to live.

19:44.280 --> 19:47.360
He should never have allowed him
to leave with your woman.

19:48.320 --> 19:50.160
Who is now my woman.

19:52.240 --> 19:53.680
Who will take Ragnar's men?

19:55.240 --> 19:57.640
Ragnar's men belong to Brida.

19:58.320 --> 20:00.120
They merely await her return.

20:02.640 --> 20:05.800
Aethelwold, you will leave tomorrow.

20:08.560 --> 20:11.600
So, I am journeying to Wessex
to become a corpse,

20:11.680 --> 20:15.880
and from my grave, I am to raise an army
and kill the greatest warrior in the land.

20:17.160 --> 20:18.000
Hmm.

20:20.240 --> 20:21.160
[Haesten chuckles]

20:35.760 --> 20:37.400
Ale, Lord?

20:39.000 --> 20:39.840
Always.

20:42.600 --> 20:45.920
And thank you for reminding me
I am a lord, Offa...

20:47.880 --> 20:49.280
my faithful servant.

20:53.320 --> 20:55.040
You and I are to make a journey.

20:56.800 --> 21:02.360
I shall return to Winchester, whereas,
you will travel from peasant to lord.

21:05.080 --> 21:06.160
I do not understand.

21:08.200 --> 21:09.960
Of course you don't. You're stupid.

21:13.640 --> 21:14.880
As I have been stupid.

21:17.920 --> 21:18.880
However...

21:20.160 --> 21:22.160
complete this next task,

21:23.680 --> 21:28.000
and your reward will be land and title,
Ealdorman Offa.

21:37.760 --> 21:38.760
[snoring]

22:06.040 --> 22:09.200
I will get you out of here,
but you will take me to your camp.

22:10.880 --> 22:13.840
You're no longer sworn to Uhtred, boy?

22:13.920 --> 22:16.280
Uhtred is cursed and has lost his mind.

22:17.120 --> 22:19.640
I am at the mercy of gods
and this is their will.

22:20.160 --> 22:21.760
Are you with me or not?

22:36.840 --> 22:38.400
[horse whinnies]

23:28.040 --> 23:29.640
[Brida] I knew you would come.

23:48.400 --> 23:49.960
He calls to me in my dreams.

23:55.040 --> 23:56.440
From Niflheim.

24:01.720 --> 24:04.280
Asking me to help him cross
from Hel into Valhalla.

24:07.160 --> 24:10.160
If there is one thing I could do,
it would be that.

24:15.040 --> 24:16.840
You're here for forgiveness.

24:18.600 --> 24:20.480
You abandoned him three times over.

24:22.200 --> 24:24.320
That was through fate, not choice.

24:26.400 --> 24:27.240
[scoffs]

24:33.840 --> 24:36.200
What are you doing? We will freeze!

24:37.760 --> 24:40.040
Niflheim is much colder
than you will ever be.

24:41.040 --> 24:42.880
If Ragnar suffers, then so shall we.

24:44.080 --> 24:46.000
There will be no comfort for you here.

24:51.680 --> 24:52.720
I'm going to sleep.

24:52.800 --> 24:54.280
Wrapped in fur?

25:31.400 --> 25:33.040
Give me your strength...

25:35.320 --> 25:37.320
your heart and your wisdom.

25:42.320 --> 25:43.800
Give me your love, brother.

25:46.640 --> 25:48.160
[inhales deeply]

25:56.000 --> 25:56.840
[sighs]

25:56.920 --> 25:58.920
[softly] You shall always have mine.

26:38.120 --> 26:38.960
Edward.

26:41.040 --> 26:44.600
You look very clean today,
apart from this mark here.

26:44.680 --> 26:45.520
Mother, please.

26:46.280 --> 26:47.600
-She teases you.
-Stop.

26:53.840 --> 26:55.720
Lord, I do not mean to disturb.

27:00.960 --> 27:03.080
There was a matter
I thought we might discuss.

27:06.360 --> 27:09.840
Speak your mind, Edward.
The king appreciates honesty.

27:13.800 --> 27:15.600
I do not regret what was done,

27:16.680 --> 27:18.320
giving my word to Uhtred,

27:18.400 --> 27:22.120
honoring my word and the battle
that followed, the victory...

27:23.160 --> 27:27.560
but I acknowledge
I went beyond what is my right.

27:28.120 --> 27:29.560
I went against you, even.

27:31.080 --> 27:33.800
I shall accept any punishment
you think necessary.

27:33.880 --> 27:37.520
Without my permission,
you swore my men to a traitor.

27:38.960 --> 27:42.040
You led my armies
into a battle I did not sanction.

27:42.120 --> 27:44.560
Your actions were not worthy
of an aetheling.

27:49.440 --> 27:51.560
They were worthy of a king.

28:10.920 --> 28:12.760
Wessex shall soon be yours.

28:13.640 --> 28:16.920
For now, it is strong,
but England remains fragile.

28:18.080 --> 28:21.560
Its future will not only be secured
with battles and with men,

28:21.640 --> 28:22.920
but with unions.

28:24.800 --> 28:27.120
We should like you to meet
the Lady Aelflaed.

28:29.080 --> 28:30.160
It is time.

28:31.840 --> 28:35.560
It is a match that will strengthen Wessex
and the crown.

28:36.360 --> 28:37.760
Your crown.

28:40.360 --> 28:42.200
I will do my utmost, Lord...

28:43.880 --> 28:46.920
for Wessex and for my king.

29:08.360 --> 29:09.200
[horse snorts]

29:26.600 --> 29:27.920
[Uhtred] Do you know them?

29:29.440 --> 29:30.920
[Brida] They look like Danes.

29:31.840 --> 29:34.200
-Yes, but do you know them?
-No.

29:36.840 --> 29:39.200
[Uhtred] We should leave.
We can eat later.

29:39.280 --> 29:40.240
And go where?

29:40.720 --> 29:43.520
To a shithole village
on the road to Legaceaster.

29:48.640 --> 29:51.480
I do not know how we can help
Ragnar escape Niflheim,

29:52.160 --> 29:55.000
but I will not return
to my own life until I've tried.

29:57.360 --> 29:58.560
What is at this village?

30:00.960 --> 30:01.960
A seer.

30:03.960 --> 30:05.160
Do you remember Storri?

30:06.840 --> 30:10.480
-Storri is a piece of shit.
-He is, but he was Ubba's seer...

30:11.800 --> 30:12.920
a Sword Dane's seer.

30:13.000 --> 30:16.080
If any man will know
how to reach a lost warrior, it is him.

30:21.600 --> 30:22.600
They have gone.

30:25.600 --> 30:27.560
We can be at the village in two days.

30:31.520 --> 30:32.360
Yeah.

30:42.760 --> 30:45.360
One more arrow and I will take your eyes!

30:45.440 --> 30:47.280
I know who sent you!

30:47.880 --> 30:48.880
You do?

30:49.880 --> 30:52.200
Tell Cnut I will return when I'm ready!

30:52.280 --> 30:54.760
Cnut will want the Dane-Slayer dead.

30:57.200 --> 30:58.200
He's with me!

30:59.320 --> 31:00.600
He has my protection!

31:01.680 --> 31:04.240
His head will be worth its weight
in silver.

31:04.320 --> 31:05.680
I have a very small head.

31:09.280 --> 31:10.160
Come out!

31:18.320 --> 31:21.080
Uhtred is mine to kill... when I'm ready.

31:22.600 --> 31:25.200
Now go, while you still have your balls.

31:25.280 --> 31:27.720
Cnut will hear that
you are protecting him.

31:28.360 --> 31:31.320
Tell Cnut I will return,
and when I do, he will have my men.

31:32.480 --> 31:33.960
He will know what that means.

31:34.040 --> 31:35.120
Now, go.

31:37.400 --> 31:38.560
Go!

31:51.240 --> 31:52.520
You do not change, woman.

31:56.280 --> 31:57.640
I spared you for Ragnar.

32:10.200 --> 32:13.480
I am told that Uhtred has ridden north
to Ragnar's grave.

32:14.120 --> 32:15.800
Alone or with his men?

32:16.880 --> 32:17.880
Alone.

32:19.360 --> 32:22.000
His men remain with Aethelflaed.

32:22.080 --> 32:22.920
I see.

32:28.400 --> 32:31.440
He is a man in great need
of the guidance of God.

32:32.320 --> 32:35.520
Lord, I could place Uhtred
in the waters a thousand times

32:35.600 --> 32:38.560
and he would not find God,
only fish. [chuckles]

32:44.280 --> 32:45.760
My son will need him.

32:47.920 --> 32:51.120
It pains me greatly to say it,
but it is true.

32:53.120 --> 32:54.560
Edward will need Uhtred.

32:57.640 --> 33:01.720
But he is an outlaw. He must remain
an outlaw until I am gone.

33:03.280 --> 33:04.520
That is your wish, Lord?

33:04.600 --> 33:07.160
That is what I wish,
but I can say it only to you.

33:07.760 --> 33:09.320
It cannot become a command.

33:11.560 --> 33:16.120
My wife is sure to oppose any bond
between Edward and Uhtred.

33:18.200 --> 33:20.560
But Edward must make his own decision...

33:22.160 --> 33:24.360
with your counsel, Father Beocca.

33:25.680 --> 33:27.280
Yes, Lord.

33:42.800 --> 33:44.600
You plan to give your men to Cnut?

33:48.280 --> 33:49.280
They're my men.

33:49.960 --> 33:51.440
Will you become Cnut's woman?

33:53.160 --> 33:54.640
It's none of your business.

33:55.800 --> 33:56.680
Will you?

33:59.960 --> 34:00.840
I must survive.

34:00.920 --> 34:03.640
Men won't follow a woman for long.
They're too stupid.

34:04.320 --> 34:05.560
But Cnut?

34:06.120 --> 34:07.120
He's a weasel.

34:07.840 --> 34:09.159
Well, what do you suggest?

34:09.760 --> 34:12.639
That I give my men to you,
we attack Bebbanburg?

34:13.360 --> 34:16.560
Because that's something
you'll never do because you're a Saxon.

34:16.639 --> 34:17.639
He's a weasel.

34:18.360 --> 34:20.719
You deserve better than Cnut
is what I'm saying.

34:22.199 --> 34:23.560
It's your turn to shit.

34:24.480 --> 34:25.880
I do not need to shit.

34:26.600 --> 34:29.639
Then let's go and find this turd, Storri.

34:38.040 --> 34:40.920
This is the second time
we have gone in search of Storri.

34:42.320 --> 34:45.320
The last time, you dispatched him
with a stick up his arse.

34:45.840 --> 34:46.719
I remember.

34:47.520 --> 34:48.560
Never forgotten.

34:50.880 --> 34:52.159
We were so young then.

34:53.120 --> 34:54.679
We were Danes then.

34:57.120 --> 34:58.600
Race you over the hill?

34:58.680 --> 35:00.640
-Why?
-Why not?

35:01.360 --> 35:02.200
Child.

35:02.960 --> 35:04.320
Afraid of losing?

35:05.360 --> 35:06.360
Child.

35:09.200 --> 35:10.640
[Uhtred laughs]

35:20.000 --> 35:21.240
[sighs]

35:21.320 --> 35:26.080
I think of Gisela every morning
I wake and every night before I sleep.

35:28.880 --> 35:29.960
I understand.

35:40.760 --> 35:43.040
I should despise Ragnar for whoring...

35:44.240 --> 35:45.400
but I can't.

35:46.120 --> 35:47.200
You loved him.

35:47.920 --> 35:49.120
More than he knew.

35:52.960 --> 35:55.600
The thought of him in Hel
is not one I can bear.

36:03.240 --> 36:04.200
[Uhtred sniffles]

36:05.480 --> 36:09.880
I swear I will not leave your side
until we have found a way to help him.

36:17.680 --> 36:19.360
Or until you have killed me.

36:19.440 --> 36:21.640
[sniffles] Then we must find a way quickly

36:22.240 --> 36:24.120
because I'm sure to kill you soon.

36:34.280 --> 36:35.840
I can't forgive you, Uhtred...

36:37.840 --> 36:39.040
for failing him.

36:40.960 --> 36:42.840
-One time.
-Three times.

36:42.920 --> 36:43.800
Once.

36:43.880 --> 36:47.320
I made one mistake.
I gave one year's service to Alfred.

36:48.600 --> 36:49.880
You gave your life.

36:52.200 --> 36:54.320
I swore an oath to Alfred
for a second time

36:54.400 --> 36:55.680
because I had no choice.

36:56.480 --> 36:58.160
A man always has a choice.

37:06.600 --> 37:12.240
After the Battle of Ethandun,
when Ragnar became Alfred's hostage,

37:12.320 --> 37:15.880
he was sent north by Alfred
to free me from my slavers.

37:16.440 --> 37:17.440
I was there.

37:20.200 --> 37:21.200
Ragnar saved me...

37:24.560 --> 37:26.920
and then we rode to save Gisela...

37:31.000 --> 37:32.440
whereupon I killed a priest.

37:33.640 --> 37:34.600
Good.

37:39.760 --> 37:41.760
And because Ragnar did not prevent it...

37:43.480 --> 37:44.520
because...

37:45.400 --> 37:49.760
I was in Ragnar's charge,
Alfred did blame Ragnar.

37:51.320 --> 37:54.040
He was going to have him
put on trial and then killed.

37:55.600 --> 37:58.960
The options given to me
were to swear a second oath to Alfred,

37:59.040 --> 38:00.520
or my brother's life.

38:04.200 --> 38:05.480
You didn't tell Ragnar.

38:24.240 --> 38:25.440
From Ragnar...

38:28.120 --> 38:29.280
and from me.

38:34.600 --> 38:36.000
I have always loved you.

38:38.520 --> 38:39.520
[sobbing]

38:46.320 --> 38:47.400
Not as a wife.

38:47.480 --> 38:48.360
[laughing]

38:52.520 --> 38:54.040
No longer as a wife.

38:55.400 --> 38:56.560
[sighs]

38:57.280 --> 38:59.320
But you will always be half my life.

39:00.040 --> 39:02.160
And all of your madness, is what you said.

39:02.240 --> 39:03.120
[both laugh]

39:03.200 --> 39:04.240
It's true.

39:22.160 --> 39:23.560
This is it?

39:23.640 --> 39:25.120
This is where we find Storri?

39:26.080 --> 39:27.480
-I see him.
-Huh?

39:27.560 --> 39:28.840
The gods are with us.

39:29.680 --> 39:31.680
[indistinct chatter]

39:35.800 --> 39:37.720
And this is from your wife?

40:02.280 --> 40:03.120
[sighs]

40:04.080 --> 40:05.080
What is it?

40:05.160 --> 40:06.520
It's bad.

40:06.600 --> 40:08.000
The ale?

40:08.560 --> 40:10.640
Your wife, she will bear many children...

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
but none shall be born living.

40:16.640 --> 40:18.640
I'm sorry, the gods can be cruel.

40:19.280 --> 40:21.560
There must be something you can do.

40:21.640 --> 40:23.680
I suggest you find a new wife.

40:24.360 --> 40:25.800
[men laughing]

40:35.560 --> 40:36.640
I despise him.

40:38.480 --> 40:39.480
We need him.

40:43.240 --> 40:44.240
[wind howling]

40:59.080 --> 41:00.240
[chickens clucking]

41:15.520 --> 41:16.400
[gasps]

41:17.720 --> 41:18.760
Come no closer.

41:20.120 --> 41:21.200
I have skill!

41:23.040 --> 41:26.000
Storri, you have chickens,
a goat and a bad smell.

41:27.360 --> 41:28.440
That is all.

41:31.080 --> 41:33.480
Uhtred Ragnarson.

41:34.080 --> 41:36.120
And you, I know you, too.

41:36.200 --> 41:37.360
Oh, I remember.

41:38.000 --> 41:39.880
All we want is your knowledge.

41:39.960 --> 41:41.520
In exchange for your life.

41:42.840 --> 41:44.280
She shamed me.

41:44.360 --> 41:46.120
You shamed me, with a branch!

41:46.200 --> 41:47.640
I shat blood for days!

41:47.720 --> 41:49.040
Storri! We will pay.

41:49.120 --> 41:50.080
We will not!

41:50.760 --> 41:52.800
We mean you no harm and we will pay.

41:54.120 --> 41:58.120
She is to come nowhere near my arse.
You understand?

41:58.200 --> 41:59.320
[chuckles]

41:59.400 --> 42:00.480
You swear it!

42:01.120 --> 42:03.520
She will come nowhere near your arse.

42:07.000 --> 42:12.160
[Storri exhales] I liked Young Ragnar
and his father, the Fearless.

42:12.240 --> 42:13.080
[chuckles]

42:14.000 --> 42:17.320
For him to be lost
in the cold of Niflheim,

42:17.400 --> 42:19.360
no true warrior deserves such a fate.

42:19.480 --> 42:20.880
Then you will help us?

42:21.600 --> 42:23.120
I would like to.

42:23.200 --> 42:26.080
But that would mean walking with the gods,

42:26.160 --> 42:29.440
asking for a solution,
perhaps time and time again.

42:30.280 --> 42:32.520
And each time would require payment.

42:32.600 --> 42:34.000
We're not here to be robbed.

42:34.080 --> 42:35.080
No.

42:36.160 --> 42:37.920
You're here to save Young Ragnar.

42:38.880 --> 42:39.720
Right?

42:41.000 --> 42:44.080
You will give us the answer tonight.
Or you will die tonight.

42:44.400 --> 42:46.400
Is she allowed to speak to me like that?

42:47.440 --> 42:51.280
Help us and you will be paid,
but it must be tonight.

42:56.360 --> 42:59.400
Well, then,
you should allow me to prepare.

42:59.480 --> 43:00.640
You're in luck, though.

43:01.240 --> 43:06.800
I have everything I need and Young Ragnar
will share in that good luck.

43:08.840 --> 43:11.560
We need to kill a chicken.

43:12.720 --> 43:15.640
But not the small one. She has a name.

43:17.760 --> 43:19.360
What is she called?

43:20.400 --> 43:23.000
-I wouldn't be surprised if he humps it.
-[clucking]

43:24.320 --> 43:25.320
Storri?

43:37.120 --> 43:37.960
[Brida] Uhtred?

43:38.040 --> 43:40.600
[Uhtred] He's gone. He's gone!

43:49.600 --> 43:51.960
I swear I did not mean to run.

43:52.040 --> 43:53.320
Just habit.

43:58.520 --> 43:59.560
My curse,

44:00.760 --> 44:02.360
I'm assuming it worked.

44:03.320 --> 44:04.360
It did.

44:06.200 --> 44:09.000
It cost me a family and my husband.

44:10.000 --> 44:12.440
I... I can make amends.

44:12.520 --> 44:15.160
I can help you reach Ragnar.

44:15.240 --> 44:16.840
-I liked him.
-[scoffs]

44:18.000 --> 44:19.280
Please, don't kill me.

44:21.960 --> 44:23.440
Don't let her kill me.

44:24.080 --> 44:25.560
I can see she'd like to.

44:26.360 --> 44:28.640
-He says he can help us.
-I heard.

44:36.800 --> 44:40.040
You might think I'm afraid of death.
I'm not.

44:41.600 --> 44:45.080
I think there are times
I would even welcome it.

44:50.120 --> 44:51.800
Almost finished.

44:51.880 --> 44:53.640
What is it you are using?

44:54.440 --> 44:56.840
Don't you need mushrooms
to walk with the gods?

44:56.920 --> 45:00.160
Oh, yes, mushrooms are vital.

45:00.240 --> 45:02.440
This is a mixture for something else.

45:02.520 --> 45:03.520
What?

45:04.360 --> 45:07.000
This is to help me... shit.

45:07.080 --> 45:08.480
You are playing with us.

45:09.600 --> 45:10.440
No.

45:15.640 --> 45:16.600
[groans]

45:17.520 --> 45:18.800
[coughs]

45:22.160 --> 45:23.320
Perhaps I am.

45:24.840 --> 45:28.000
And perhaps this was poison
to help me end my life.

45:29.440 --> 45:30.840
[retching]

45:31.640 --> 45:33.080
[laughing]

45:34.800 --> 45:36.800
I am playing with you.

45:38.760 --> 45:40.120
But it does help me shit.

45:40.200 --> 45:45.240
You will tell us how to help Ragnar
or I swear I will cut you cock to throat.

45:45.320 --> 45:47.240
I know exactly how to help him.

45:47.320 --> 45:49.640
-Then say it!
-And nothing more.

45:50.520 --> 45:51.560
Very well.

46:02.920 --> 46:04.800
[Storri breathing heavily]

46:09.800 --> 46:11.440
The Goddess Hel...

46:13.720 --> 46:16.680
will surrender your brother's soul,

46:17.520 --> 46:19.800
but only in return for another.

46:20.640 --> 46:22.680
You must kill the man who killed Ragnar.

46:23.760 --> 46:25.480
The man who denied him.

46:26.120 --> 46:28.760
You will wet the blade
with the blood of Ragnar,

46:28.840 --> 46:33.000
and with that blade only must you kill
the man who sent him to Hel.

46:33.600 --> 46:38.000
Only that way will he be free to enter
the feast halls of Valhalla.

46:40.640 --> 46:41.680
[exhales sharply]

46:43.240 --> 46:44.200
Ragnar is dead.

46:45.240 --> 46:47.840
His blood is black. It's dust, almost.

46:47.920 --> 46:50.000
Might his blood be in others?

46:51.680 --> 46:52.520
Thyra.

46:53.720 --> 46:54.800
Who's Thyra?

46:55.400 --> 46:57.440
Ragnar's sister. Blood sister.

46:59.720 --> 47:01.040
Then, you have it.

47:05.000 --> 47:08.160
Now, pay me well and leave me in peace.

47:08.240 --> 47:09.200
Thank you.

47:14.400 --> 47:15.920
I have one more thing to ask.

47:17.720 --> 47:18.680
I will pay.

47:18.760 --> 47:19.800
Ask.

47:22.480 --> 47:23.760
How do you kill a curse?

47:24.840 --> 47:26.120
I knew it.

47:27.000 --> 47:29.520
I saw the darkness on your shoulder.

47:30.320 --> 47:31.280
It's yours.

47:40.560 --> 47:43.360
[Storri] Do you have something for me,
Uhtred?

47:44.280 --> 47:46.040
-[Brida grunting]
-[Storri choking]

47:46.120 --> 47:47.080
[Uhtred] Brida, no!

47:47.160 --> 47:50.440
Yes! Trust me!
Don't touch him! Don't touch him!

47:50.520 --> 47:52.520
Trust me! Don't do anything!

47:55.120 --> 47:56.280
Don't!

48:00.760 --> 48:02.560
-[Brida screaming]
-[Storri choking]

48:12.080 --> 48:13.240
[Brida panting]

48:26.960 --> 48:28.240
[crying]

48:38.120 --> 48:39.000
Brida?

48:47.080 --> 48:50.520
[stuttering] I just did what one has to do
to break a curse.

48:50.600 --> 48:53.320
You have to kill the sorcerer
without breaking the skin

48:53.400 --> 48:55.760
and without shedding one drop of blood.

48:55.840 --> 48:57.680
You've got to do the same to Skade.

48:59.360 --> 49:01.480
If you can't, you can make her your woman.

49:10.160 --> 49:11.920
He cursed you when?

49:12.840 --> 49:15.160
A long time ago.
We were young. [chuckles]

49:22.040 --> 49:23.320
He threw a curse,

49:23.400 --> 49:25.960
I stuck a branch up his arse.
It was that day.

49:29.920 --> 49:31.920
I've been a barren bitch ever since.

49:52.280 --> 49:54.080
You have lifted your own curse.

49:54.840 --> 49:57.240
Yes. For what it's worth.

49:58.400 --> 49:59.800
Why not sooner?

50:01.360 --> 50:03.040
Because I was a warrior first.

50:05.840 --> 50:06.960
Because I'm a fool.

50:08.560 --> 50:09.680
You are no fool.

50:09.760 --> 50:12.160
But you are the bravest warrior.

50:13.520 --> 50:16.640
I knew how to kill a curse
since before you arrived at Dunholm.

50:16.720 --> 50:18.240
I chose not to tell you...

50:19.600 --> 50:21.400
because I knew you wouldn't stay.

50:23.000 --> 50:24.960
So, I wanted to see you suffer.

50:27.840 --> 50:30.000
I did love you, Uhtred,
but that has passed.

50:33.000 --> 50:34.760
I do not believe you.

50:36.240 --> 50:37.840
We are one, you and I.

50:48.080 --> 50:51.960
From the moment I took your hand on
the steps of the great hall of Eoferwic,

50:52.040 --> 50:53.120
we were bound as one.

50:58.520 --> 50:59.880
You may dislike me,

51:00.720 --> 51:03.800
hate me if you wish, despise me at times.

51:03.880 --> 51:05.080
[laughs]

51:07.560 --> 51:09.160
But love is immortal.

51:11.920 --> 51:13.480
It goes on.

51:15.920 --> 51:18.800
I will find Skade
and I must kill this curse.

51:19.560 --> 51:21.240
Then I will go to Thyra.

51:23.760 --> 51:25.560
I will discover who killed Ragnar.

51:27.000 --> 51:28.920
We send him on his way to Valhalla?

51:33.080 --> 51:35.560
At some point,
I'll see you on the battlefield.

51:36.280 --> 51:37.760
I won't hesitate to kill you.

51:39.040 --> 51:41.200
That does not mean you do not love me.

51:41.280 --> 51:42.400
[laughs]
