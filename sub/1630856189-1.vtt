00:07.862 --> 00:11.467
Ladies.

00:11.551 --> 00:15.916
Are there any beautiful ladies
in the house?

00:16.000 --> 00:19.916
Let me hear you scream.

00:33.724 --> 00:37.260
♪ Oh, baby ♪

00:37.344 --> 00:40.984

00:47.241 --> 00:50.674

00:50.758 --> 00:54.502

01:05.931 --> 01:08.122
- Hey, Jeremiah.
- Hey, wassup?

01:08.206 --> 01:09.709
Here are your credentials and info

01:09.793 --> 01:10.847
for the hotel at our next stop.

01:10.931 --> 01:12.467
All right. Thanks.

01:12.551 --> 01:14.709
Hey, has Dante heard my new arrangement?

01:14.793 --> 01:16.743
He's not interested in changing
up the show right now.

01:16.827 --> 01:18.812
We've been playing
the same set for months.

01:18.896 --> 01:20.950
We've been all over the country
with that same set.

01:21.034 --> 01:23.122
That's my point.

01:23.206 --> 01:24.984
Look, the fans aren't complaining.

01:25.068 --> 01:26.398
It's what they expect?

01:26.482 --> 01:29.467
Look, music is supposed
to make you feel something.

01:29.551 --> 01:30.950
He needs a new sound.

01:31.034 --> 01:32.103
Him or you?

01:32.965 --> 01:35.743
Look, Jay, you're really talented.

01:35.827 --> 01:38.881
And Dante is lucky to have
a guy like you on his team.

01:38.965 --> 01:41.674
But this is the music he wants to make.

01:41.758 --> 01:43.709
If that's not what you wanna do anymore,

01:43.793 --> 01:44.984
maybe it's time to move on.

01:45.068 --> 01:46.191
And go where?

01:46.275 --> 01:48.295
My contract's not up
for another two years.

01:48.379 --> 01:49.206
I don't know.

01:50.034 --> 01:51.605
But when we get to Pennsylvania,

01:51.689 --> 01:52.881
try talking to him again.

01:52.965 --> 01:54.157
Wait, Pennsylvania?

01:54.241 --> 01:56.241
Yeah. Some small town no one's heard of.

01:57.310 --> 01:59.295
Okay.
We're not doing the majors?

01:59.379 --> 02:01.088
Ticket sales weren't great
in the bigger cities

02:01.172 --> 02:03.295
so the label have to try
in the burbs for a few nights.

02:03.379 --> 02:04.743
And Dante went along with that?

02:04.827 --> 02:06.122
He doesn't have a choice.

02:06.206 --> 02:07.467
Unless he has a tantrum,

02:07.551 --> 02:08.916
we'll be there through Christmas.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.709
You know the name of the town?

02:10.793 --> 02:12.709
Uh, Adventures or something.

02:12.793 --> 02:16.068
Advent... Wait, Adventure?

02:17.482 --> 02:19.053
We're playing Adventura for the holidays?

02:19.137 --> 02:20.398
Yeah, you know it?

02:20.482 --> 02:21.743
It's where I grew up.

02:21.827 --> 02:22.689
Oh.

02:23.551 --> 02:24.950
Could you drop me at my parent's house

02:25.034 --> 02:26.467
instead of the hotel?

02:26.551 --> 02:28.088
Yeah. I'll, uh, talk to driver.

02:28.172 --> 02:29.778
See you in a bit.

02:29.862 --> 02:31.019

Willow?

03:05.034 --> 03:06.433
Hmm, okay.

03:06.517 --> 03:07.689
My daughter.

03:08.482 --> 03:10.157

03:16.586 --> 03:18.950

a choir rehearsal worship.

03:23.827 --> 03:25.295

04:01.793 --> 04:03.916
Willow, how was your audition?

04:04.000 --> 04:05.088
I think it went okay

04:05.172 --> 04:06.398
but I don't think they love the fact

04:06.482 --> 04:08.226
that I chose a gospel song to audition.

04:08.310 --> 04:10.743
Maybe you should've done
your Toni Braxton voice.

04:10.827 --> 04:14.088
Oh, like,

04:14.172 --> 04:16.329
Oh, no. You should have done Beyoncé.

04:16.413 --> 04:19.088
Oh, baby, you don't know
how much I need this.

04:19.172 --> 04:20.881
I just...

04:20.965 --> 04:22.398
I need something different, you know.

04:22.482 --> 04:23.640
I need some excitement.

04:23.724 --> 04:25.916
What you need is a date.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.640
Is a date gonna take my voice further

04:27.724 --> 04:29.088
than the pews of Trinity?

04:29.172 --> 04:30.881
Well, it depends on who it's with.

04:30.965 --> 04:33.191
No. I don't need a date.

04:33.275 --> 04:35.157
What I need is a chance to sing somewhere

04:35.241 --> 04:36.137
other than Trinity.

04:37.344 --> 04:39.674
Well, um, maybe another
opportunity will come up.

04:39.758 --> 04:41.329
In Adventura?

04:41.413 --> 04:43.364
Nothing exciting ever happens here.

04:43.448 --> 04:45.241
Dante?

04:48.310 --> 04:50.103
Do you think he's actually on the bus?

05:07.586 --> 05:09.379
Home sweet home.

05:16.655 --> 05:17.743
Cute house.

05:17.827 --> 05:19.000
Thanks.

05:22.586 --> 05:24.088
I think that house is missing a gnome.

05:25.206 --> 05:27.122
Our bishop and his daughter live there.

05:27.206 --> 05:28.827
Gnomes are new though.

05:30.172 --> 05:33.310
So, how does it feel to be
back after all these years?

05:36.137 --> 05:38.172
Like I'm back where I belong.

06:16.620 --> 06:18.329
Stan, call 911.

06:18.413 --> 06:20.689
Ma, it's me, Jeremiah.

06:22.137 --> 06:23.191
What's going on?

06:23.275 --> 06:25.053
Child, you almost gave me a heart attack.

06:25.137 --> 06:27.068
Oh, my goodness.

06:27.965 --> 06:29.364
Wassup, Pop?

06:29.448 --> 06:30.847
What are you doing here?

06:30.931 --> 06:33.019
You ain't been here in years.

06:33.103 --> 06:34.881
I know it's been a minute
since I've been back

06:34.965 --> 06:37.847
but, you know, work here has been busy.

06:37.931 --> 06:39.103
Busy.

06:42.103 --> 06:43.329
Same old pop.

06:43.413 --> 06:44.984
Don't mind him.

06:45.068 --> 06:46.950
You're always welcome
to come home, sweetie.

06:47.034 --> 06:48.674
In fact, I know someone

06:48.758 --> 06:50.950
who's gonna be more than
excited to see you.

06:51.034 --> 06:52.191
Who would that be?

06:52.275 --> 06:54.191
Hmm, pretty girl

06:54.275 --> 06:55.778
that was supposed to be my daughter-in-law

06:55.862 --> 06:57.502
until you screwed it up.

06:57.586 --> 06:59.778
- Goes to my church.
- Momma, please.

06:59.862 --> 07:02.053
- Oh--
- Willow does not wanna see me.

07:02.137 --> 07:03.950
It's been almost three years
since we've seen each other.

07:04.034 --> 07:06.053
Well, if it's not Willow,
then who's the lucky lady

07:06.137 --> 07:07.536
who's gonna make me a grandmother?

07:07.620 --> 07:09.433
- Ma--
- Oh, don't momma me.

07:09.517 --> 07:11.709
I told you I do not have time for dating

07:11.793 --> 07:12.709
while I'm on the road.

07:12.793 --> 07:14.364
Music is my girlfriend.

07:14.448 --> 07:15.778
I'd like to see the day

07:15.862 --> 07:16.847
when music keeps you warm at night.

07:16.931 --> 07:17.881
Oh, my God.

07:17.965 --> 07:19.536
Can we please?

07:19.620 --> 07:20.916
- I won't say nothing else.
- Thank you.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.536
- You hungry?
- I am.

07:22.620 --> 07:24.260
I got a chicken pot pie in the fridge

07:24.344 --> 07:25.502
if you want some.

07:25.586 --> 07:27.260
- Yes.
- Okay.

07:27.344 --> 07:28.605
Made it from scratch.
Let's go.

07:28.689 --> 07:30.226
Okay. Well, let me...
Let me get your weapon.

07:30.310 --> 07:31.881
Thank you.

07:31.965 --> 07:33.103
It's good to have you home.

07:37.793 --> 07:39.847
There you go. Okay.
You keep it right there.

07:39.931 --> 07:42.433
And then it's you coming
along the same time

07:42.517 --> 07:43.571
that I come in...

07:43.655 --> 07:44.931
Let's get it started.

07:47.206 --> 07:48.881
Bro, you're, like, an hour late.

07:48.965 --> 07:51.620
I know.
I ain't here for no lecture.

07:52.310 --> 07:53.536
Okay.

07:53.620 --> 07:55.950
- Can we talk about the music?
- What about it?

07:56.034 --> 07:58.053
I've sent several new arrangements to you

07:58.137 --> 07:59.743
that I think will take the show

07:59.827 --> 08:01.019
to the next level musically.

08:01.103 --> 08:03.019
It's not my sound.

08:03.103 --> 08:04.379
Did you listen to them?

08:05.379 --> 08:06.950
Just no. It's not my sound.

08:07.034 --> 08:08.758
Not your...

08:09.827 --> 08:11.260
So, what is your sound?

08:11.344 --> 08:12.862
Whatever I say it's gonna be.

08:14.172 --> 08:16.088
Don't trip, you work for me, all right?

08:16.172 --> 08:18.433
And that means you play what I tell you.

08:18.517 --> 08:21.068
- Okay.
- Now, let's get back to work.

08:29.689 --> 08:31.329
Did you find anything?

08:31.413 --> 08:33.088
No. Not yet.

08:33.172 --> 08:35.536
What's Dante even doing here.

08:35.620 --> 08:39.467
With his entire band.
In a tour bus.

08:39.551 --> 08:41.984
Willow, a tour bus?

08:42.068 --> 08:44.329
There has to be a performance
or maybe he's--

08:44.413 --> 08:45.724
Found it.

08:46.620 --> 08:50.088
Five nights at the Apache Music Hall.

08:50.172 --> 08:53.088
Oh, my gosh.

08:53.172 --> 08:56.122
This could be it.
This could be your big break.

08:56.206 --> 08:59.019
Look, one of his background singers

08:59.103 --> 09:01.709
is going home to be with their
family for the holidays.

09:01.793 --> 09:03.571
Dante's ranting about it on his live.

09:03.655 --> 09:05.157
That's what I was saying.

09:05.241 --> 09:06.329
Folks needs to be professional

09:06.413 --> 09:08.226
and work with integrity.

09:08.310 --> 09:10.260
I can't do two-part harmonies
without two girls.

09:10.344 --> 09:12.364
So look, if there are any singers

09:12.448 --> 09:14.364
in the Pittsburgh or surrounding areas,

09:14.448 --> 09:17.467
meet me at the studio
for an audition as a DT girl.

09:17.551 --> 09:19.019
This is it.

09:19.103 --> 09:21.226
This is your sign from God.

09:21.310 --> 09:24.137
Sign? What's the sign?

09:27.068 --> 09:30.743
Well, Willow has an audition
to be a DT girl.

09:30.827 --> 09:33.847
Grace. Grace.

09:33.931 --> 09:35.467
I'm so sorry, Willow.

09:35.551 --> 09:37.000
But this is a man of God.

09:38.310 --> 09:40.364
Uh, have a blessed day everyone.

09:40.448 --> 09:42.482
Grace and peace.

09:43.896 --> 09:46.310
Judas.

09:47.827 --> 09:49.260
What's a DT girl?

09:49.344 --> 09:51.157
Um, it's just an audition.

09:51.241 --> 09:55.364
I probably won't even make it
in time or even get it.

09:55.448 --> 09:57.984
An audition for what?
You still haven't said.

09:58.068 --> 10:02.241
To sing background for Dante.

10:03.103 --> 10:04.364
Is he a gospel singer?

10:04.448 --> 10:06.329
Because as the worship leader
of this church--

10:06.413 --> 10:08.881
- Okay. That again.
- Yes. That again.

10:08.965 --> 10:11.019
You made a commitment.

10:11.103 --> 10:13.157
When I was nine years old.

10:13.241 --> 10:14.965
So you wanna be removed
from the worship team?

10:16.310 --> 10:18.502
Because members of the worship
team at this church

10:18.586 --> 10:20.640
singing anything other than gospel music

10:20.724 --> 10:22.827
would mean immediate dismissal.

10:23.758 --> 10:25.329
How would that look?

10:25.413 --> 10:27.019
Pastor's daughter

10:27.103 --> 10:29.019
singing in nightclubs
Saturday night

10:29.103 --> 10:31.068
and the pulpit Sunday morning?

10:32.517 --> 10:35.724
Fine, Daddy.
I won't go the audition.

10:37.448 --> 10:38.448
Good.

10:41.172 --> 10:43.758
And tell you about it.

10:51.310 --> 10:52.103
Hello?

10:53.620 --> 10:54.896
Dante?

10:57.724 --> 11:00.536
Hi. I, uh, I'm Willow Terry.

11:00.620 --> 11:03.310
I saw a post looking for
a background singer.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
Jeremiah?

11:06.689 --> 11:08.344
Hello, Willow.

11:09.448 --> 11:10.517
Long time.

11:11.862 --> 11:13.034
Not long enough.

11:22.068 --> 11:23.812
So where is he?

11:23.896 --> 11:26.793
Dante is not the type
to stick around this late.

11:28.379 --> 11:29.709
You look good.

11:29.793 --> 11:31.122
You look terrible.

11:31.206 --> 11:34.260
Same old Willow.

11:34.344 --> 11:36.226
What's that supposed to mean?

11:36.310 --> 11:40.674
Just that, it's really good
to see a familiar face.

11:40.758 --> 11:42.965
Well, I wish
I could say the same.

12:02.137 --> 12:05.502
♪ Away in a manger ♪

12:05.586 --> 12:09.053
♪ No crib for a bed ♪

12:09.137 --> 12:10.536
I couldn't believe it.

12:10.620 --> 12:13.295
He had this stupid smirk on his face.

12:13.379 --> 12:14.847
So what did you say?

12:14.931 --> 12:16.984
Well, I didn't even get to sing
for Dante, let alone meet him.

12:17.068 --> 12:18.226
To Jeremiah.

12:18.310 --> 12:21.122
Oh, there was nothing to say.

12:21.206 --> 12:23.536
Hey, you guys are doing so amazing.

12:23.620 --> 12:26.053
Really good. You can go
ahead and take five.

12:26.137 --> 12:27.157
- Really?
- Yeah.

12:28.206 --> 12:29.502
So you're telling lies in church now.

12:29.586 --> 12:31.674
I like to call it positive reinforcement.

12:31.758 --> 12:34.502
Hmm. And what do you mean
there was nothing to say?

12:34.586 --> 12:36.640
You dated that man for five years

12:36.724 --> 12:38.950
and that same man promised
to love you forever

12:39.034 --> 12:40.536
and then broke your heart,
Willow.

12:40.620 --> 12:42.674
He didn't break anything.

12:42.758 --> 12:44.467
He was the one itching
to get out of Adventura

12:44.551 --> 12:45.709
since we were kids.

12:45.793 --> 12:48.950
And... And we both agreed

12:49.034 --> 12:50.295
he was a terrible person

12:50.379 --> 12:52.502
and I was better off by myself.

12:52.586 --> 12:53.881
Right.

12:53.965 --> 12:55.191
And if I never saw him again,

12:55.275 --> 12:57.019
it wouldn't be soon enough.

12:57.103 --> 12:58.778
I just wish I knew how long
he'd be here this time.

12:58.862 --> 13:01.640
Well, they changed venues last-minute.

13:01.724 --> 13:03.965
And they'll be here through Christmas.

13:05.517 --> 13:07.950
Or so I've heard.

13:08.034 --> 13:10.088
So are you going back to the audition?

13:10.172 --> 13:12.536
- No. No thanks.
- Willow.

13:12.620 --> 13:15.019
Bishop doesn't want me
singing secular music.

13:15.103 --> 13:17.191
And now that I know Jeremiah
is gonna be there,

13:17.275 --> 13:18.743
I do not need the headache.

13:18.827 --> 13:20.640
It can't be that bad.

13:20.724 --> 13:24.088
Jeremiah White and I
are like oil and water.

13:24.172 --> 13:26.536
What is it about him that
gets you so turned around?

13:26.620 --> 13:27.536
Have you seen him?

13:27.620 --> 13:30.433
Yes, I have.

13:30.517 --> 13:32.191
And he is beautiful.

13:32.275 --> 13:34.467
Oh, he is the most annoying,

13:34.551 --> 13:37.398
most know-it-all, most my way
or the highway human being

13:37.482 --> 13:39.743
I have ever met in my life.

13:39.827 --> 13:41.344
Girl, have you ever met anyone like that?

13:44.000 --> 13:46.172
You two may have more
in common than you think.

13:47.965 --> 13:49.103
Just saying.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.502
Please tell your parents the jubilee

13:55.586 --> 13:57.260
is only a few days away.

13:57.344 --> 13:59.881
And we have rehearsal
every day until then.

13:59.965 --> 14:02.433
The dress rehearsal
will be the night before.

14:02.517 --> 14:03.950
And you have to be here.

14:04.034 --> 14:05.709
Now, I know it sounds like a lot.

14:05.793 --> 14:06.778
But if you want something,

14:06.862 --> 14:09.053
you can't let anything get in your way.

14:09.137 --> 14:11.157
If you're not here
for the dress rehearsal,

14:11.241 --> 14:13.536
you do not minister on Christmas Eve.

14:13.620 --> 14:14.709
Does everyone understand?

14:14.793 --> 14:16.226
Yes, Minister Terry.

14:16.310 --> 14:17.724
Okay, go ahead.
Get out of here.

14:20.724 --> 14:21.605
Hey, hey.

14:21.689 --> 14:23.433
Hey.

14:23.517 --> 14:25.605
Are you sure

14:25.689 --> 14:27.640
you want those kids
to sing at the jubilee.

14:27.724 --> 14:29.984
What are you talking about?

14:30.068 --> 14:32.226
It's a trinity tradition.

14:32.310 --> 14:34.310
I know, but when we were kids
we could actually sing.

14:35.758 --> 14:38.157
The kids have been singing at
the jubilee for over 30 years.

14:38.241 --> 14:39.950
Don't remind me. I know.

14:40.034 --> 14:41.433
It's the biggest event of the year.

14:41.517 --> 14:42.778
And the one your mother created.

14:42.862 --> 14:45.088
I know, but...

14:45.172 --> 14:50.433
What about if this Christmas jubilee,
we have the kids mime.

14:50.517 --> 14:52.812
Hear me out.

14:52.896 --> 14:55.881
Do you see the vision?

14:55.965 --> 14:57.812
Yeah.

14:57.896 --> 14:59.984
The bible says make a joyful noise.

15:00.068 --> 15:02.364
Uh, they might make a noise, all right.

15:06.275 --> 15:08.053
Bishop Terry.

15:08.137 --> 15:11.226
Maybe we could move it to
Easter because, that way,

15:11.310 --> 15:13.551
I could definitely get them
on key by then.

15:21.793 --> 15:23.467
Oh, no.

15:23.551 --> 15:26.364
Okay. I'll be right there.

15:26.448 --> 15:28.881
Uh, what happened?

15:28.965 --> 15:31.605
Minister Eddie slipped on ice.

15:31.689 --> 15:33.019
He's in the hospital

15:33.103 --> 15:34.881
So we don't have a minister of music?

15:34.965 --> 15:35.881
Nope.

15:35.965 --> 15:37.571
Oh, no, that's so terrible.
Is he okay?

15:37.655 --> 15:39.984
I don't know, baby.
I'm gonna find out.

15:40.068 --> 15:41.709
Okay, well, I'm just gonna
work on some, uh,

15:41.793 --> 15:44.157
song changes and ideas for the jubilee.

15:44.241 --> 15:45.586
Okay.

15:46.793 --> 15:47.674
I gotta go.

15:47.758 --> 15:49.620
Oh, all right.

15:50.482 --> 15:51.605
- I hope he's okay.
- Me too.

15:51.689 --> 15:53.000
Terrible timing.

15:54.275 --> 15:55.674
What a shame.

15:55.758 --> 15:58.206
It's this close to the jubilee.

16:02.793 --> 16:04.433
Jeremiah.

16:04.517 --> 16:05.743
Bishop.

16:05.827 --> 16:06.827
Jeremiah.

16:08.379 --> 16:09.536
Long day for you.

16:09.620 --> 16:11.295
Uh, hospital visit.

16:11.379 --> 16:12.950
One of our members
hurt himself pretty bad.

16:13.034 --> 16:14.709
Oh. I'm sorry to hear that.

16:14.793 --> 16:16.226
You here to visit your folks?

16:16.310 --> 16:18.709
Yes, sir. I've got a gig coming up and I--

16:18.793 --> 16:20.364
- Oh, you're still playing?
- Yes, sir.

16:20.448 --> 16:21.413
For the Lord?

16:22.620 --> 16:25.571
- Well--
- I'm just messin'.

16:25.655 --> 16:27.655
Your momma says you're traveling
the world with your gift.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.364
It's amazing, son.

16:30.448 --> 16:32.467
- You make us proud.
- Thank you.

16:32.551 --> 16:34.916
Listen, I am around
for the next couple of weeks,

16:35.000 --> 16:38.088
so if you need any help with snow
or anything, let me know.

16:38.172 --> 16:41.793
Well, I may not need your help
with the snow...

16:43.206 --> 16:46.241
but there is something
you could help me with.

16:47.448 --> 16:49.605
Thank you, Grace.

16:49.689 --> 16:52.364
Now I'm sure all of you
have heard Minister Eddie

16:52.448 --> 16:54.674
suffered a nasty fall

16:54.758 --> 16:56.709
and he may be out for a while.

16:56.793 --> 16:58.088
I thought he just sprained his wrist?

16:58.172 --> 16:59.517
Silence.

17:01.172 --> 17:03.467
There's a new sheriff in town.

17:03.551 --> 17:05.743
A new general on the front lines,

17:05.827 --> 17:09.467
a new queen up in this castle.

17:09.551 --> 17:11.640
Now, there's a lot of work to
be done in the next few days.

17:11.724 --> 17:12.847
If we're gonna be ready for the jubilee

17:12.931 --> 17:16.467
and we will be ready.

17:16.551 --> 17:18.778
There will be no talking.

17:18.862 --> 17:21.088
All choreography must be approved by me.

17:21.172 --> 17:24.191
So Sister Patterson, girl,
that little dance that you do,

17:24.275 --> 17:25.743
- that little rock.
- Mm-hmm.

17:25.827 --> 17:27.260
It's got to go.

17:27.344 --> 17:28.984
- You know, the one I'm talking about--
- Hello.

17:29.068 --> 17:32.502
Ha, "Praise God,
from whom all blessings flow."

17:32.586 --> 17:34.019
Bishop.

17:34.103 --> 17:35.778
Great news, everyone.

17:35.862 --> 17:37.778
I found our new interim minister of music

17:37.862 --> 17:39.433
until the Christmas jubilee.

17:39.517 --> 17:41.502
Oh, Daddy, you don't need to do a speech.

17:41.586 --> 17:43.122
- I'm kind of--
- A true son of this church.

17:43.206 --> 17:44.329
Huh?

17:44.413 --> 17:46.019
Although he hasn't been here for a while.

17:46.103 --> 17:48.295
He's been traveling the world
with his gifts.

17:48.379 --> 17:51.241
I give you Mr. Jeremiah White.

18:12.068 --> 18:13.984
- Hey.
- Get out.

18:14.068 --> 18:15.743
I see you haven't changed a bit.

18:15.827 --> 18:18.088
Why do you keep saying that?
Why would I change?

18:18.172 --> 18:20.433
- I am amazing.
- Yes, you are.

18:20.517 --> 18:21.571
What are you doing here?

18:21.655 --> 18:22.881
Bishop asked me to come.

18:22.965 --> 18:23.984
And you could say no.

18:24.068 --> 18:25.502
I can't tell bishop no.

18:25.586 --> 18:27.536
- He's known me since I was 10.
- Fine.

18:27.620 --> 18:29.329
You already have a job,
so just go back to it.

18:29.413 --> 18:30.640
Look, if this is about the other night.

18:30.724 --> 18:32.674
We don't talk about that here.

18:32.758 --> 18:34.088
Willow, listen, I--

18:34.172 --> 18:35.743
Why can't you just stay in your lane

18:35.827 --> 18:37.157
and then you just let me stay in mine?

18:37.241 --> 18:38.571
I am in my lane.

18:38.655 --> 18:40.536
No, your a crashed car swerving,
spinning directly into my lane.

18:40.620 --> 18:43.157
- You always--
- Hey, young people.

18:43.241 --> 18:44.709
- Hey, Daddy.
- Bishop.

18:44.793 --> 18:46.605
I believe this is a divine connection.

18:46.689 --> 18:49.433
I'm excited to see what God
is gonna do with his union.

18:49.517 --> 18:52.053
You two have always
had an incredible chemistry

18:52.137 --> 18:53.536
ministering together.

18:53.620 --> 18:55.191
- Jeremiah?
- Yes.

18:55.275 --> 18:57.502
Willow is gonna walk you
through everything

18:57.586 --> 18:59.053
we've been doing and done

18:59.137 --> 19:01.433
for the past few years with the jubilee.

19:01.517 --> 19:02.793
Ain't that right, pumpkin?

19:04.034 --> 19:05.467
Yes. Yes, I am.

19:05.551 --> 19:06.950
But, um, Daddy, you know,

19:07.034 --> 19:09.295
Jeremiah is not a gospel singer.

19:09.379 --> 19:11.295
- He's not a singer?
- No, he's not.

19:11.379 --> 19:14.088
Well, you know what's written,

19:14.172 --> 19:15.812
"When the devil goes to messin',

19:15.896 --> 19:18.398
God goes to blessin'."

19:18.482 --> 19:19.329
Better praise him.

19:21.137 --> 19:22.881
I don't think
that's in the bible, but okay.

19:22.965 --> 19:24.984
Anyway, I'm gonna get outta your way.

19:25.068 --> 19:27.778
The whole church is counting on you
two to pull this thing together,

19:27.862 --> 19:30.571
but I know you won't let me down.

19:30.655 --> 19:32.812
Mm.

19:35.482 --> 19:36.433
See you later, Bishop.

19:36.517 --> 19:38.137
See you later, Bishop.

19:39.896 --> 19:40.950
Really?

19:41.034 --> 19:42.053
Yeah. Really.

19:42.137 --> 19:43.482
Get out of my office.

19:51.413 --> 19:53.295
Why does he do this every year?

19:53.379 --> 19:55.157
Every year it's the same thing.

19:55.241 --> 19:58.157
Because it's his home and that's
what he chooses to do.

19:58.241 --> 19:59.950
Yeah, but we gotta look at it.

20:00.034 --> 20:01.950
It's his expression of holiday cheer.

20:02.034 --> 20:04.226
And it shouldn't affect you
so much, you old Grinch.

20:04.310 --> 20:06.605
You're only saying that
because he's your pastor.

20:06.689 --> 20:08.467
Well, he used to be your pastor too.

20:08.551 --> 20:11.571
And he could be again, if you came down
to the church every once in a while.

20:13.206 --> 20:14.862
I'm not doing this with you, Dolores.

20:16.551 --> 20:17.950
Stop stealing my cookies.

20:18.034 --> 20:19.896
You can eat cookies at church.

20:37.344 --> 20:38.571
Morning, neighbor.

20:38.655 --> 20:40.551
Morning, neighbor.

20:42.344 --> 20:44.260
Could I help you with something?

20:44.344 --> 20:46.122
As a matter of fact,

20:46.206 --> 20:47.881
I was hoping you could be neighborly

20:47.965 --> 20:49.881
and not put as many of your ugly,

20:49.965 --> 20:52.896
creepy-looking gnomes
out this year, neighbor.

20:53.827 --> 20:56.275
Oh, you mean like...

20:58.000 --> 20:59.433
like this gnome?

20:59.517 --> 21:02.000
Yes. Just like that one.

21:03.103 --> 21:04.620
No can do, neighbor.

21:06.793 --> 21:10.329
You put out your holiday decorations
before Thanksgiving.

21:10.413 --> 21:12.984
And I didn't have a lick
to say about it now, did I?

21:13.068 --> 21:15.536
My decorations are tasteful.

21:15.620 --> 21:18.157
Not some creatures from beyond.

21:18.241 --> 21:19.467
You wouldn't happen to be afraid

21:19.551 --> 21:20.724
of gnomes now, would you, Stan?

21:21.275 --> 21:22.206
Afraid?

21:23.931 --> 21:27.103
I think they're an eyesore to the neighborhood
and we can do without them.

21:28.275 --> 21:29.448
They're traditional.

21:30.034 --> 21:31.674
They're ugly.

21:31.758 --> 21:34.709
Isn't it interesting that back in the day,

21:34.793 --> 21:37.191
gnomes were used to protect children

21:37.275 --> 21:39.896
and animals from evil?

21:40.758 --> 21:43.226
Are you calling me evil, Bishop?

21:43.310 --> 21:45.226
No.

21:45.310 --> 21:48.241
Just an interesting fact, neighbor.

21:49.655 --> 21:52.295
But my gnomes are staying
right where they are

21:52.379 --> 21:54.896
and there ain't nothing
you can do about it.

21:58.206 --> 21:59.517
We'll see about that.

22:15.931 --> 22:17.295
Hello everybody.

22:17.379 --> 22:19.881
Um, we...

22:19.965 --> 22:21.931
Hello, everyone.

22:22.827 --> 22:24.502
Can I have everyone's attention?

22:24.586 --> 22:26.122
Hey, does anyone have any gum?

22:26.206 --> 22:27.068
Gum.

22:28.448 --> 22:33.000
If everyone could just,
you know, if everyone...

22:34.275 --> 22:36.502
All right, let's, uh, let's go
ahead and get started.

22:36.586 --> 22:38.984
I know I have some somewhere in here.

22:39.068 --> 22:40.088
I know I packed gum.

22:40.172 --> 22:41.226
I thought we could start

22:41.310 --> 22:42.467
with "Joy to the World."

22:42.551 --> 22:43.827
Oh, I found it.

22:45.551 --> 22:47.743
- Willow. Willow.
- Yeah.

22:47.827 --> 22:49.379
Can you help me get everyone's attention?

22:50.551 --> 22:51.482
Um...

22:52.482 --> 22:53.586
No.

22:57.655 --> 22:59.034
Okay.

22:59.896 --> 23:01.000
Great.

23:02.448 --> 23:03.724
Thanks.

23:10.620 --> 23:12.260
Ow! What was that for?

23:12.344 --> 23:14.295
You saw how hard he was trying to connect.

23:14.379 --> 23:15.502
Okay. Well, maybe
they don't want him to be

23:15.586 --> 23:17.122
the minister of music.
It's not my fault.

23:17.206 --> 23:18.605
You're just jealous that Bishop made him

23:18.689 --> 23:20.260
the minister of music and not you.

23:20.344 --> 23:21.571
No, I am not.

23:21.655 --> 23:22.950
Ow!

23:23.034 --> 23:24.571
Don't lie in God's house.

23:24.655 --> 23:28.916
Fine. My feelings are a little hurt.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.812
Bishop didn't even consider me for the job

23:30.896 --> 23:32.571
and I have been hinting at it for years.

23:32.655 --> 23:34.778
Willow, you're not the minister of music.

23:34.862 --> 23:36.467
Jeremiah is,

23:36.551 --> 23:38.467
and he could use your help.

23:38.551 --> 23:40.260
You're still a member of this worship team

23:40.344 --> 23:44.157
and you should want it to be the best
that it could be at all times.

23:44.241 --> 23:48.950
And if you help him,
maybe he can help you, too.

23:49.034 --> 23:51.655
Isn't there someone
he can talk to for you?

23:52.689 --> 23:54.344
Maybe get you an audition.

23:56.344 --> 23:57.433
That's a good idea.

23:57.517 --> 23:58.433
I know.

23:58.517 --> 23:59.433
So play smarter.

23:59.517 --> 24:00.640
Mmm-hmm.

24:00.724 --> 24:01.847
That's why you're my girl.

24:01.931 --> 24:02.847
- Okay.
- That's right.

24:02.931 --> 24:03.862
Okay.

24:07.758 --> 24:09.689
I guess it's not going
as well as you hoped.

24:11.034 --> 24:13.571
If you don't learn how
to speak up for yourself,

24:13.655 --> 24:16.275
then no one is ever
going to listen to you.

24:17.413 --> 24:18.502
I did.

24:18.586 --> 24:19.881
No, you didn't.

24:19.965 --> 24:21.640
You said, "Hello, I'm Jeremiah.

24:21.724 --> 24:23.571
I'd really love if you listen to me."

24:23.655 --> 24:25.157
Whatever.
I don't sound like that

24:25.241 --> 24:26.551
Well, you did before puberty.

24:28.931 --> 24:31.157
Look, I'm not saying
you have to do it like Eddie,

24:31.241 --> 24:32.847
you definitely don't have
to do it like me.

24:32.931 --> 24:35.916
But you have to speak with confidence.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.019
You gotta talk like
you have something to say.

24:38.103 --> 24:39.674
Why are you helping me now?

24:39.758 --> 24:41.344
Because I need a favor.

24:42.551 --> 24:44.191
Oh, the feeling is mutual, brother.

24:44.275 --> 24:46.019
Look, I'll go in there and help you,

24:46.103 --> 24:47.467
like Bishop wants me to,

24:47.551 --> 24:49.950
but I need you to talk to Dante

24:50.034 --> 24:51.536
and convince him to let me audition

24:51.620 --> 24:52.847
to be one of his background singers.

24:52.931 --> 24:53.984
Now, don't look at me like that.

24:54.068 --> 24:55.329
You know why I was there the other night.

24:55.413 --> 24:57.226
Okay. I thought we couldn't
talk about that here.

24:57.310 --> 24:58.413
You can't.

24:59.586 --> 25:00.827
So do we have a deal?

25:04.206 --> 25:06.103
I can't guarantee that he'll say yes.

25:07.620 --> 25:09.295
I just need you to talk to him.

25:09.379 --> 25:11.605
My voice will do the rest.

25:11.689 --> 25:13.586
Now, come on.
I'll show you how it's done.

25:14.310 --> 25:15.482

Uh, yeah.

Yeah. He, um...

26:29.896 --> 26:31.896
He said someone like you
wouldn't be a good fit.

I guess it's not even good enough

26:46.689 --> 26:48.137

Willow, can I talk to you for a second?

28:18.206 --> 28:19.433
This feels serious.

28:19.517 --> 28:21.896
No. I mean, no. Come on.

28:24.172 --> 28:26.172
It's just, um...

28:27.482 --> 28:28.724
It's just...

28:30.655 --> 28:33.517
How do you want the audience
to feel when you perform?

28:35.482 --> 28:36.689
I don't wanna perform.

28:37.448 --> 28:38.793
I wanna minister.

28:40.172 --> 28:43.950
When I open my mouth,
I want people's lives to change.

28:44.034 --> 28:46.881
You know they come in here
with heavy spirits

28:46.965 --> 28:48.467
and stressed,

28:48.551 --> 28:50.448
unsure what to do next.

28:52.068 --> 28:54.950
I just don't think a performance
can change that.

28:55.034 --> 28:57.916
You know, only the presence of God can.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.743
Okay. And do you think we're doing that

29:00.827 --> 29:04.344
with the jubilee, with how
you're singing right now?

29:05.206 --> 29:06.502
No.

29:06.586 --> 29:08.191
But I think we could.

29:08.275 --> 29:10.019
If we involved all the creative ministries

29:10.103 --> 29:11.551
not just the choir.

29:12.137 --> 29:14.053
You know, the step team,

29:14.137 --> 29:17.053
the dancers, sign language ministry.

29:17.137 --> 29:18.984
Wait, we have all that here?

29:19.068 --> 29:21.053
Yeah. And I think this could be

29:21.137 --> 29:22.950
a great time of year
to get everyone involved.

29:23.034 --> 29:26.053
Okay. So why don't we?

29:26.137 --> 29:28.984
Bishop won't let it happen.
He hates change.

29:29.068 --> 29:31.812
Everything in Trinity has to
and will stay the same.

29:31.896 --> 29:33.536
Okay. Well, he said that I was free to do

29:33.620 --> 29:35.053
whatever I wanted this year.

29:35.137 --> 29:36.965
And I think that is a great idea.

29:38.724 --> 29:40.413
- He said that to you?
- Mmm-hmm.

29:41.103 --> 29:42.620
Yeah, so let's do it.

29:45.793 --> 29:48.931
You know, as long as I've been here...

29:50.620 --> 29:52.812
As long as I've pleaded with him

29:52.896 --> 29:55.226
to make some changes,

29:55.310 --> 29:58.019
Bishop has never granted me one inch

29:58.103 --> 29:59.413
of what I wanted to do.

30:03.482 --> 30:05.724
I guess it really is your choir now, huh?

30:06.551 --> 30:07.709
You can do whatever you want

30:07.793 --> 30:10.275
and I'll sing whatever you want me to.

30:11.724 --> 30:13.172
I see how it is now.

30:27.310 --> 30:28.379
Hi.

30:29.275 --> 30:31.191
- What's up, Tre?
- Ms. Tee,

30:31.275 --> 30:33.536
I wanna audition for a solo in jubilee.

30:33.620 --> 30:36.847
Well, there are no solos
in the children's choir, Tre.

30:36.931 --> 30:38.916
I know, but there should be.

30:39.000 --> 30:39.931
And I should do it.

30:40.517 --> 30:41.605
And why you?

30:41.689 --> 30:43.329
'Cause I can really sing.

30:43.413 --> 30:45.689
Well, let's hear what you got.

30:47.379 --> 30:51.950
♪ Hark!
The herald angels sing ♪

30:52.034 --> 30:55.881
♪ Glory to
The new born King ♪

30:55.965 --> 31:00.191
♪ Peace on Earth
And mercy mild ♪

31:00.275 --> 31:05.275
♪ God and sinners
Reconciled ♪

31:06.413 --> 31:07.881
Who knew you had pipes like that, Tre?

31:07.965 --> 31:09.536
I didn't know you could sing like that?

31:09.620 --> 31:11.640
I never got the chance to show you.

31:11.724 --> 31:13.433
But you said last Sunday,

31:13.517 --> 31:15.743
if you want something,
don't let anyone or anything

31:15.827 --> 31:18.191
stand in your way and go for it.

31:18.275 --> 31:19.847
Hmm.

31:19.931 --> 31:21.724
I guess I did say that, huh?

31:22.551 --> 31:23.674
Well, I don't know.

31:23.758 --> 31:25.881
It looks like you just turned
yourself a solo, Tre.

31:25.965 --> 31:27.984
Oh, yes. Thanks, Ms. Tee.

31:28.068 --> 31:29.206
You're the best!

31:34.448 --> 31:36.605
That's all wrong!

31:36.689 --> 31:38.413
Y'all not keeping up with me, man.

31:39.620 --> 31:41.000
Let's take it from the top.

31:43.482 --> 31:46.053
Dante. Mr. Dante, hi.

31:46.137 --> 31:48.260
My name is Willow,
Willow Terry.

31:48.344 --> 31:50.191
And I wanna be one
of your background singers

31:50.275 --> 31:51.640
if you will just give me a chance.

31:51.724 --> 31:53.379
- I--
- Slow down.

31:54.241 --> 31:56.674
- Wait. What?
- Well, Jeremiah said

31:56.758 --> 31:58.433
you didn't think I'd be
a good fit for the band,

31:58.517 --> 32:00.571
but I will not let down,
I promise.

32:00.655 --> 32:01.724
I didn't say that.

32:02.517 --> 32:03.379
Wait, you know her?

32:04.517 --> 32:06.157
Yeah, we grew up together

32:06.241 --> 32:07.467

What is your name again?

32:37.172 --> 32:38.689
Willow, sir.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
Hmm, show's in two days, sweetheart.

32:42.689 --> 32:44.310
Welcome to Dante's world.

32:48.517 --> 32:51.122
Willow.
Wi... Willow.

32:51.206 --> 32:53.088
- Willow. Willow. Will you wait--
- You lied to me.

32:53.172 --> 32:54.398
I didn't mean it like that, okay?

32:54.482 --> 32:55.502
I did it to protect you.

32:55.586 --> 32:57.157
Who are you to protect me?

32:57.241 --> 32:58.881
Who are you to take
an opportunity from me?

32:58.965 --> 33:00.088
I didn't mean it like that.

33:00.172 --> 33:01.502
Well, then, how did you mean it?

33:01.586 --> 33:03.329
Hmm? You either think I'm good enough

33:03.413 --> 33:05.984
to be in the band or you don't?

33:06.068 --> 33:07.674
Oh, what? You think you're
the only talented person

33:07.758 --> 33:09.329
- from Adventura?
- Willow, listen--

33:09.413 --> 33:11.034
Look, you may not see my talent,

33:12.517 --> 33:13.605
but Dante does.

33:13.689 --> 33:14.950
And I'm gonna sing for him.

33:15.034 --> 33:16.778
You're not the only one
with dreams, Jeremiah.

33:16.862 --> 33:18.053
Let me explain.

33:18.137 --> 33:19.984
I don't wanna hear it.

33:20.068 --> 33:21.502
It's just like when we were kids.

33:21.586 --> 33:23.364
You waltz into my town and my church

33:23.448 --> 33:25.191
and you take everything
like it belongs to you.

33:25.275 --> 33:28.709
And then you just bounce when
you've created enough chaos.

33:28.793 --> 33:31.758
Well, look, I said it then,
and I mean it now.

33:32.689 --> 33:34.984
You don't belong here.

33:35.068 --> 33:36.847
So you might as well
just go back on the road

33:36.931 --> 33:38.758
and this time, stay gone.

33:50.896 --> 33:52.502
I caught you.

33:52.586 --> 33:54.122
What? You're crazy.

33:54.206 --> 33:55.778
Give me back my gnomes, Stan,

33:55.862 --> 33:57.709
and all will be forgiven.

33:57.793 --> 34:00.157
You get off my property
before I call the police.

34:00.241 --> 34:02.778
- Bishop, what's going on?
- What's going on?

34:02.862 --> 34:04.950
Your husband's a thief.
That's what is going on!

34:05.034 --> 34:06.605
You ain't gonna stand on my porch

34:06.689 --> 34:08.191
and call me no thief.

34:08.275 --> 34:10.122
I call it as I see it.

34:10.206 --> 34:11.295
- Pa. Pa.
- Now, stop. Stop.

34:11.379 --> 34:12.467
I ain't no thief.

34:12.551 --> 34:13.881
And I never been no thief.

34:13.965 --> 34:15.103
Oh, really?

34:19.827 --> 34:21.172
- Oh, my Lord.
- Dad.

34:23.931 --> 34:25.689
Pa. Pop, you...

34:27.344 --> 34:28.950
I'm sorry about all of this, Bishop.

34:29.034 --> 34:31.088
Okay, I'll find your gnomes
and return them.

34:31.172 --> 34:32.620
So sorry, Bishop.

34:36.827 --> 34:39.295
I can't believe you stole
that man's gnomes.

34:39.379 --> 34:40.502
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

34:40.586 --> 34:42.433
I did no such thing.

34:42.517 --> 34:44.586
You two have got to stop this foolishness.

34:50.172 --> 34:51.275
And what are you looking at?

34:52.448 --> 34:53.605
What's going on with you, Pop?

34:53.689 --> 34:55.433
I didn't steal his gnomes.

34:55.517 --> 34:56.793
I didn't ask that.

35:00.724 --> 35:02.088
Look.

35:02.172 --> 35:04.157
I know things have been
different between us lately

35:04.241 --> 35:06.812
but you know you can talk to me, right?

35:06.896 --> 35:09.743
Hmm, when you don't even bother to visit

35:09.827 --> 35:11.709
because you're so busy on the road?

35:11.793 --> 35:14.433
Pop, we did two tours, back to back.

35:14.517 --> 35:16.364
So that means forget
about your old man, right?

35:16.448 --> 35:18.517
The phone works both ways.

35:24.586 --> 35:27.916
Look, son,
I know you've moved on.

35:28.000 --> 35:31.295
You've got your own life
and your dreams to go to

35:31.379 --> 35:34.088
but I just wonder,
have you stopped to think

35:34.172 --> 35:36.000
about the people you're leaving behind?

35:37.413 --> 35:39.344
And I'm not the only one
that feels this way.

35:48.896 --> 35:50.295
Hey.

35:50.379 --> 35:52.088
You got a sec?

35:52.172 --> 35:54.743
Won't ever have time for people
who lie to my face.

35:54.827 --> 35:57.122
Look, Willow,
I wanna apologize.

35:57.206 --> 35:59.068
- Oh, that's nice.
- No, I mean it.

36:00.413 --> 36:02.812
Look, I know you don't believe it

36:02.896 --> 36:04.847
but the first time
I heard you singing,

36:04.931 --> 36:06.191
I knew you were the best singer

36:06.275 --> 36:07.674
that I'd ever heard in my life.

36:07.758 --> 36:09.605
- You were 10.
- And you are still

36:09.689 --> 36:12.137
the best singer
I have ever heard in my life.

36:13.137 --> 36:14.551
You'll always be.

36:17.620 --> 36:19.433
Look, I couldn't tell
Dante about you

36:19.517 --> 36:21.655
not because you're not talented enough,

36:22.482 --> 36:24.000
but because I just...

36:25.586 --> 36:29.053
Look, Dante, he is one of...
Life on the road is...

36:29.137 --> 36:32.329
I'm not trying to go on the road with you.

36:32.413 --> 36:34.916
- You're not?
- No, I just wanna sing,

36:35.000 --> 36:36.709
somewhere outside of Trinity for a change.

36:36.793 --> 36:38.965
Why is that so important to you?

36:55.758 --> 36:58.103
My mom was happiest when she'd sing.

37:00.793 --> 37:03.344
And it wasn't always in my daddy's pulpit.

37:05.758 --> 37:08.103
Don't you remember she'd sing everywhere?

37:10.689 --> 37:12.379
You know when she got sick,

37:15.793 --> 37:17.551
she told me, I should too,

37:18.655 --> 37:19.965
but, uh...

37:21.068 --> 37:24.000
Bishop doesn't want me
singing secular music.

37:25.172 --> 37:27.655
He says that's what took her from us.

37:28.827 --> 37:31.379
But I wanna find true happiness too.

37:33.517 --> 37:36.103
So I will sing anywhere

37:38.206 --> 37:41.847
even if that means
singing backup for Dante.

37:41.931 --> 37:45.433
I'm sorry I didn't help you
get the gig with Dante

37:45.517 --> 37:47.310
and told you that I did,

37:48.206 --> 37:50.709
but now you know your talent

37:50.793 --> 37:52.467
was enough to get you there

37:52.551 --> 37:54.724
and you didn't need any help from me.

37:56.068 --> 37:57.379
Well, duh.

37:58.137 --> 38:00.122
I'm the bomb.

38:00.206 --> 38:01.433
- You're so--
- You knew that.

38:01.517 --> 38:02.674
Whatever.

38:06.310 --> 38:08.000
Do you accept my apology?

38:10.137 --> 38:11.517
Can I ask you a question?

38:12.103 --> 38:13.206
Sure.

38:14.655 --> 38:17.793
Why did it take you so many
years to come back here?

38:21.758 --> 38:24.847
Because I asked you to come with me

38:24.931 --> 38:25.965
and you said no.

38:28.379 --> 38:30.847
And so, it was just easier
for me to stay away

38:30.931 --> 38:34.724
than to admit
I was still in love with you.

38:39.758 --> 38:41.812
You didn't need a girlfriend
where you were headed.

38:41.896 --> 38:43.019
Yeah.

38:43.103 --> 38:44.068
I did.

38:46.827 --> 38:49.068
And you still didn't answer my question.

38:51.413 --> 38:53.329
Yeah.

38:53.413 --> 38:55.862
I accept your apology,
Jeremiah.

38:57.137 --> 38:58.586
Thank you.

38:59.620 --> 39:01.068
You're welcome.

39:07.620 --> 39:09.502
All right.
All right, all right.

39:09.586 --> 39:11.536
Looking good, looking good, Big D.

39:11.620 --> 39:12.674
Can I get that mic packed?

39:12.758 --> 39:13.984
Yeah.

39:15.965 --> 39:17.743
Hey, Willow. You good?

39:17.827 --> 39:19.103
Little nervous.

39:24.000 --> 39:25.674
- You sure?
- Yeah.

39:25.758 --> 39:26.655
All right.

39:27.758 --> 39:29.758
I know you all see the snow outside,

39:30.448 --> 39:32.260
but, baby, I promise,

39:32.344 --> 39:33.827

just to make a fool--

40:12.655 --> 40:14.467
- Where is she?
- It doesn't matter.

40:14.551 --> 40:15.743
Where is she?

40:15.827 --> 40:16.709
- Hey.
- Where is she?

40:16.793 --> 40:17.778
Hey, whoa, whoa.
Give her a second, okay?

40:17.862 --> 40:19.019
- This is her first--
- Look, I'm really sorry.

40:19.103 --> 40:20.916
- You should be.
- Dante--

40:21.000 --> 40:22.433
I know,
I shouldn't have hired

40:22.517 --> 40:24.586
some country bumpkin singer wannabe.

40:25.586 --> 40:26.793
You're fired.

40:28.103 --> 40:29.398
Wait. Wait.

40:29.482 --> 40:31.482
Wait, no... Willow.

40:37.758 --> 40:39.413
Who do you think you're talking to?

40:40.620 --> 40:41.758
What did you say to me?

40:45.241 --> 40:47.310
I said, who do you think
you're talking to?

40:50.241 --> 40:52.053
I ain't got time for this drama.

40:52.137 --> 40:53.398
I'm out.

40:53.482 --> 40:55.000
Let's go.

41:01.896 --> 41:03.448
Sorry, Jeremiah.

41:13.551 --> 41:16.157
Whoa. Come here, girl.
It's freezing out here.

41:16.241 --> 41:18.812
Well, it's better out here than in there.

41:18.896 --> 41:21.605
Look, it wasn't that bad, okay?

41:21.689 --> 41:23.034
Are you still lying to me?

41:23.965 --> 41:26.551
Okay. You're right.
It was that bad.

41:27.413 --> 41:29.571
But we've all had those moments.

41:29.655 --> 41:31.088
I doubt that.

41:31.172 --> 41:34.122
Okay. So, one time when I was rushing,

41:34.206 --> 41:36.743
setting up my keyboard stand
for a concert,

41:36.827 --> 41:38.502
I guess I didn't secure it
right or something

41:38.586 --> 41:40.605
and the entire thing came crashing down

41:40.689 --> 41:42.053
right in the middle of our set.

41:42.137 --> 41:44.226
- No.
- Worse, I broke my amp

41:44.310 --> 41:45.571
so no one could hear a single thing

41:45.655 --> 41:47.103
the entire concert.

41:49.137 --> 41:50.260
That's not a real story.

41:51.862 --> 41:55.571
No, but I thought it might cheer you up.

41:55.655 --> 41:57.571
It kind of did.

41:57.655 --> 41:59.398
There you go. Good.

41:59.482 --> 42:01.226
Just...

42:01.310 --> 42:02.812
I never thought
I'd get stage fright

42:02.896 --> 42:05.502
if I wasn't singing gospel music.

42:05.586 --> 42:09.172
I am so, so proud of you
for at least trying.

42:11.137 --> 42:12.586
You wanna get out of here?

42:13.206 --> 42:14.984
And go where?

42:15.068 --> 42:18.689
I know a place that has
great music, and hot cocoa.

42:20.103 --> 42:22.275
- Okay.
- Come on. Let's go.

42:46.689 --> 42:48.862
Jay, what is that?

42:50.275 --> 42:52.812
That is not finished.

42:52.896 --> 42:53.758
I've heard it before.

42:55.413 --> 42:57.502
You were playing that
at the studio when I came in.

42:59.103 --> 43:02.517
You know, it's kind of sad,
but it's beautiful.

43:03.206 --> 43:04.916
It can get lonely on the road,

43:05.000 --> 43:08.310
and sometimes I get a little
depressed about it.

43:09.448 --> 43:11.709
Yeah.
This song came out of that.

43:11.793 --> 43:14.137
Are there lyrics to go with that melody?

43:15.689 --> 43:17.019
Yeah.

43:17.103 --> 43:20.398
And, uh, will you sing it for me?

43:20.482 --> 43:22.088
- No, it's--
- Please?

43:22.172 --> 43:23.448
Ah.

43:24.620 --> 43:25.655
Okay.

43:39.862 --> 43:44.965
♪ This year is gone ♪

43:46.206 --> 43:51.689
♪ But my pain has grown ♪

43:53.758 --> 44:00.068
♪ Where do I go from here ♪

44:01.896 --> 44:04.674
♪ When the way back home ♪

44:04.758 --> 44:10.896
♪ Seems unclear? ♪

44:18.724 --> 44:20.743
Something like that.

44:20.827 --> 44:22.655
That was beautiful.

44:23.793 --> 44:28.517
And why is this not out in the world?

44:29.379 --> 44:31.191
'Cause it's missing something.

44:31.275 --> 44:33.551
I'm sure a lot of people
could relate to it.

44:35.034 --> 44:37.640
I always miss my mom around
this time of year.

44:37.724 --> 44:42.812
And I always miss being home
around this time of year.

44:42.896 --> 44:45.950
Well, you should finish it and record it.

44:47.103 --> 44:49.172
Yeah, well, maybe you're right.

44:51.275 --> 44:52.984
Mmm.

44:53.068 --> 44:56.137
"For I know the plans I have
for you," says the Lord.

44:57.068 --> 45:00.984
Plans to prosper you, not to harm you.

45:01.068 --> 45:04.674
Plans to give you hope and a future.

45:04.758 --> 45:06.931
Jeremiah 29:11.

45:07.620 --> 45:08.881
Your favorite scripture.

45:08.965 --> 45:10.551
Yeah.

45:11.965 --> 45:13.709
Hey.
About what you said earlier--

45:13.793 --> 45:15.364
Yeah, well, we don't have
to go back there.

45:15.448 --> 45:16.502
No, we do.

45:16.586 --> 45:17.655
It's important.

45:19.413 --> 45:20.620
Look, um...

45:22.103 --> 45:25.103
I said I wouldn't leave
Adventura with you because...

45:26.448 --> 45:29.157
I couldn't leave Bishop
to deal with my mom's death

45:29.241 --> 45:30.310
all by himself.

45:31.586 --> 45:32.778
You could've told me that.

45:32.862 --> 45:36.053
Yeah, I know, but I didn't
want you to feel guilty

45:36.137 --> 45:37.674
or sorry for me.

45:37.758 --> 45:40.241
Or even worse, stay for the wrong reason.

45:41.827 --> 45:45.275
And I know you came back
to play at her funeral, and...

45:48.793 --> 45:50.551
I just want you to know...

45:52.482 --> 45:54.655
my feelings for you never changed.

46:00.000 --> 46:01.709
What was that?

46:01.793 --> 46:02.984
Well, sometimes

46:03.068 --> 46:05.502
when there's freezing
temperatures and high winds,

46:05.586 --> 46:07.260
- the power goes out.
- Don't worry.

46:07.344 --> 46:08.571
The generator will kick in.

46:10.000 --> 46:12.053
Okay.

46:13.482 --> 46:15.881
And that is probably my dad.

46:15.965 --> 46:17.122
Come on in, Bishop.

46:17.206 --> 46:19.019
What's your dad doing here?

46:19.103 --> 46:20.881
For the past few years,
every time the power goes out,

46:20.965 --> 46:22.137
we come over to your parents'.

46:23.344 --> 46:25.640
Couple hours, couple days.

46:25.724 --> 46:27.157
Doesn't matter.

46:27.241 --> 46:28.984
The generator keeps the lights on

46:29.068 --> 46:32.689
and the fireplace keeps
the house and us warm.

46:33.517 --> 46:36.260
Okay. Okay.

46:36.344 --> 46:38.398
I told you to get that generator.

46:38.482 --> 46:40.260
I got the generator last March.

46:40.344 --> 46:42.103
It just broke down.

46:48.482 --> 46:49.862
Hey, kids.

46:56.379 --> 46:57.881
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

46:57.965 --> 47:00.689
- Morning.
- Wait. I have it.

47:01.793 --> 47:03.260
Such a gentleman now.

47:03.344 --> 47:04.862
Of course.

47:05.965 --> 47:08.191
Uh, I made coffee for you.

47:08.275 --> 47:09.413
Thanks.

47:12.413 --> 47:13.689
How'd you sleep?

47:14.413 --> 47:15.847
- Uh, great. Great.
- Okay.

47:15.931 --> 47:16.984
- Yeah.
- Okay.

47:17.068 --> 47:18.034
How did you sleep?

47:18.896 --> 47:20.295
Also great.

47:20.379 --> 47:21.502
Great.

47:21.586 --> 47:23.122
Nice. Sleeping great.

47:23.206 --> 47:24.433
Mmm-hmm.

47:30.482 --> 47:32.172
- Ooh. Thank you.
- Of course.

47:32.965 --> 47:34.379
- Got it.
- All right.

47:37.379 --> 47:39.053
Mmm. Smells good.

47:39.137 --> 47:40.275
Just like you.

47:45.896 --> 47:47.260
Cheers.

47:47.344 --> 47:48.433
Cheers.

47:50.068 --> 47:51.157
I didn't steal your gnome.

47:51.241 --> 47:52.640
Yes, you did.

47:52.724 --> 47:54.295
Is that...

47:54.379 --> 47:55.536
I don't know what you're talking about.

47:55.620 --> 47:56.812
I think so.
Yes, you do. It was you.

47:56.896 --> 47:57.896
No, I don't.

47:58.724 --> 48:01.053
I knew it.

48:01.137 --> 48:02.260
Get that trash out of my face.

48:02.344 --> 48:03.778
How can you still deny it?

48:03.862 --> 48:06.295
I have the video proof and the gnomes.

48:06.379 --> 48:08.364
Anybody could have put those in my closet.

48:08.448 --> 48:09.571
Aha!

48:09.655 --> 48:12.019
How did you know
I got this from your closet?

48:12.103 --> 48:14.536
Only the thief would know
where he hid the evidence.

48:14.620 --> 48:16.364
I let you stay in my house

48:16.448 --> 48:18.467
and you go snooping around my closet?

48:18.551 --> 48:20.398
Stay in your own house next time.

48:20.482 --> 48:21.743
- Okay, Pop. Listen.
- Just admit it.

48:21.827 --> 48:23.743
Fine. I took it.

48:23.827 --> 48:25.088
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

48:25.172 --> 48:26.122
Yeah.
No, I'm way ahead of you.

48:26.206 --> 48:27.812
Okay. Let's do this.

48:27.896 --> 48:28.965
Why it took you so long to find them?

48:33.758 --> 48:35.191
Move!

48:35.275 --> 48:36.586
Run! Go inside.

48:55.448 --> 48:57.398
Ah. There you are.

48:57.482 --> 48:58.620
I need a favor.

48:59.620 --> 49:01.019
Hello.

49:01.103 --> 49:03.122
Hello. I need a favor.

49:03.206 --> 49:04.502
Okay, what?

49:04.586 --> 49:05.916
I finished the song.

49:06.000 --> 49:08.295
I realized what was missing.

49:08.379 --> 49:09.379
You.

49:10.896 --> 49:12.640
What?

49:12.724 --> 49:13.778
No.

49:13.862 --> 49:15.916
You didn't say who needed to record it.

49:16.000 --> 49:18.329
Obviously, I meant you should record it.

49:18.413 --> 49:20.605
You said it yourself
the world needs to hear it,

49:20.689 --> 49:23.000
and I think the world needs to hear you.

49:35.551 --> 49:36.482
Hey, Willow.

49:37.724 --> 49:39.122
Don't forget to breathe.

49:40.724 --> 49:42.000
You got this.

52:07.620 --> 52:09.364
Whoa. Wow. Whoo!

52:09.448 --> 52:11.571
So, what are you gonna do with the demo

52:11.655 --> 52:12.847
now that it's done?

52:12.931 --> 52:14.226
I sent it over to our label,

52:14.310 --> 52:16.398
see if they had any artists
they can send it to.

52:16.482 --> 52:18.088
- That's exciting.
- Yeah.

52:18.172 --> 52:20.053
Well, waiting on Dante
to give me permission

52:20.137 --> 52:23.344
to pen something meaningful
is a complete waste of time.

52:24.344 --> 52:26.467
I haven't felt this creative in a while.

52:26.551 --> 52:29.260
I'm shocked you stayed with him this long.

52:29.344 --> 52:31.088
I signed a bad contract,

52:31.172 --> 52:33.778
but Dante wasn't always this guy.

52:33.862 --> 52:36.122
The bigger he got, the bigger his ego got.

52:36.206 --> 52:38.226
He changed.
I didn't.

52:38.310 --> 52:39.881
And that's when the issues started.

52:39.965 --> 52:41.260
Are you gonna stay with him?

52:41.344 --> 52:43.778
Feels like
I'm starting to make the music

52:43.862 --> 52:45.709
that I really wanna make.

52:45.793 --> 52:47.295
Don't know how
I'll give that up

52:47.379 --> 52:49.862
to play the same songs every night again.

52:51.793 --> 52:55.088
Why don't we do a duet for the jubilee?

52:55.172 --> 52:57.122
I mean, you said
I have a beautiful voice

52:57.206 --> 52:58.950
and you're not too bad yourself.

53:00.137 --> 53:02.260
I think we can make some
beautiful harmonies.

53:02.344 --> 53:04.329
What would you wanna do?

53:04.413 --> 53:07.896
"Alone at Christmas Time", but together.

53:08.724 --> 53:10.157
That could work.

53:10.241 --> 53:11.364
I know it could work.

53:11.448 --> 53:13.122
That's why I said it.

53:13.206 --> 53:14.413
Okay.

53:19.413 --> 53:20.743
- Hey, Ma.
- Hey.

53:20.827 --> 53:22.536
Oh. Thank God. Y'all are home.

53:22.620 --> 53:24.984
They're moving Minister Eddie
out of the hospital.

53:25.068 --> 53:27.502
And Brenda needs me
to take the kids to see Santa,

53:27.586 --> 53:29.329
and I gotta get these cookies done

53:29.413 --> 53:30.571
and take them down to the church.

53:30.655 --> 53:31.778
Well, I'm sure it'll be okay.

53:31.862 --> 53:33.000
Yeah, Ma. We can do it.

53:33.724 --> 53:35.226
Oh, thank you.

53:35.310 --> 53:36.482
We can?

53:37.172 --> 53:38.260
Unless you're scared

53:38.344 --> 53:40.295
my cookies are gonna look
better than yours.

53:40.379 --> 53:42.329
Didn't you almost burn down
our high school

53:42.413 --> 53:43.950
by starting a fire in Home Ec?

53:44.034 --> 53:46.640
Only after you gave us food poisoning.

53:46.724 --> 53:48.191
Oh, you are so wrong.

53:48.275 --> 53:49.605
- Okay.
- Okay. What do we need to do?

53:49.689 --> 53:51.122
Just don't burn the cookies.

53:51.206 --> 53:52.329
Uh-huh.

53:52.413 --> 53:53.640
I love you, Ma.

53:53.724 --> 53:54.984
All right. Let's do it.

53:55.068 --> 53:56.502
Yeah. Let's go.

53:56.586 --> 53:59.482
Uh, here we go. And...

54:00.724 --> 54:01.709
Bow!

54:01.793 --> 54:03.502
How you like me now?

54:03.586 --> 54:05.398
Ooh, I don't.

54:05.482 --> 54:07.260
- Uh-uh.
- Hater.

54:07.344 --> 54:08.329
- Huh?
- Hater.

54:08.413 --> 54:09.743
How am I a hater?

54:09.827 --> 54:11.398
You know what that looks like?

54:11.482 --> 54:13.034
- What?
- One of my dad's gnomes.

54:14.586 --> 54:16.088
I'm so done with you.

54:16.172 --> 54:18.000
Mmm-hmm.

54:19.413 --> 54:21.847
You know, I've always wondered

54:21.931 --> 54:23.088
what made your dad start putting out

54:23.172 --> 54:24.605
all those gnomes each year.

54:24.689 --> 54:26.709
Those things are scary at nighttime.

54:26.793 --> 54:28.640
Yeah, they are a little scary, huh?

54:28.724 --> 54:30.226
- A lot of scary.
- A lot of scary.

54:32.103 --> 54:35.413
Well, he started right after
my mom passed.

54:36.517 --> 54:39.226
She used to put some out around the house,

54:39.310 --> 54:41.053
you know, just a few.

54:41.137 --> 54:43.019
And he definitely has gone overboard,

54:43.103 --> 54:45.605
and he knows it, but...

54:45.689 --> 54:48.433
I don't know, I guess it helps
with his grief, you know?

54:48.517 --> 54:50.467
He needs somewhere to put it.

54:50.551 --> 54:52.053
That makes sense.

54:52.137 --> 54:53.502
You know, I can always tell

54:53.586 --> 54:54.743
how badly he's missing her

54:54.827 --> 54:57.053
by how many gnomes he puts
out that Christmas.

54:58.655 --> 55:01.344
- Oh. Hey, Pop.
- Hey.

55:02.448 --> 55:04.398
Uh, want a cookie?

56:08.896 --> 56:11.157
I thought you were finished with all
your Christmas wrapping this year.

56:11.241 --> 56:12.536
Oh.

56:12.620 --> 56:14.295
I'm wrapping these for Willow.

56:14.379 --> 56:15.605
Ah.

56:15.689 --> 56:17.896
She could never get her bows to lie right,

56:18.758 --> 56:19.812
so I've taken over.

56:21.931 --> 56:23.157
There.

56:23.241 --> 56:24.482
It calms me.

56:27.689 --> 56:30.502
So, how are things going with you two?

56:30.586 --> 56:31.862
Honestly?

56:33.206 --> 56:34.467
We've been getting along great.

56:34.551 --> 56:35.502
Mmm-hmm.

56:35.586 --> 56:36.916
I mean, we've revamped the show,

56:37.000 --> 56:38.847
gotten some of the other
ministries involved,

56:38.931 --> 56:41.812
which has amplified both of our workloads,

56:41.896 --> 56:44.000
but, overall,

56:44.827 --> 56:46.295
she's a dream to work with.

56:46.379 --> 56:48.847
I've always liked that girl.

56:48.931 --> 56:51.398
I know you mean you've always
liked her more than me.

56:51.482 --> 56:53.088
Oh, hush.

56:53.172 --> 56:54.605
Willow is my daughter.

56:54.689 --> 56:56.467
Now, I may not have birthed her,

56:56.551 --> 56:58.260
but I love her just the same.

56:58.344 --> 56:59.916
Well, I can definitely see

57:00.000 --> 57:02.398
where she gets
some of her mean streak from.

57:02.482 --> 57:04.916
Well, she may be prickly around the edges.

57:05.000 --> 57:06.778
Most people are,

57:06.862 --> 57:09.191
when they have as big a heart as she does.

57:09.275 --> 57:11.433
Speaking of prickly,

57:11.517 --> 57:13.551
Pops seems a little more...

57:14.620 --> 57:16.502
What's the word
I'm looking for?

57:16.586 --> 57:18.379
I'll accept prickly.

57:19.344 --> 57:20.482
What's going on with him?

57:21.275 --> 57:22.709
I don't know, Jeremiah.

57:22.793 --> 57:24.793
What do you think is going on with him?

57:25.758 --> 57:27.088
I don't know.

57:27.172 --> 57:29.984
I can't put my finger on it.

57:30.068 --> 57:32.433
He's been so distant since I've been home,

57:32.517 --> 57:34.502
and it's like I can't ever

57:34.586 --> 57:35.536
do anything right

57:35.620 --> 57:36.709
to make him happy.

57:36.793 --> 57:38.827
Have you told him how you feel?

57:41.896 --> 57:43.827
I'll take that as a no.

57:45.586 --> 57:47.226
Now, I would never think
that I could speak

57:47.310 --> 57:49.433
on behalf of your father,

57:49.517 --> 57:50.984
but if I was a gambling woman,

57:51.068 --> 57:52.157
which I am not,

57:52.241 --> 57:54.812
because that would be a sin before God.

57:54.896 --> 57:59.379
But, your father loves you.

58:00.482 --> 58:03.310
And he's very proud
of the man that you've become.

58:05.034 --> 58:07.398
I think that he wishes
that you would've let him

58:07.482 --> 58:10.103
be a part of it, just a little bit more.

58:17.310 --> 58:18.778
Talk to your father.

58:27.034 --> 58:29.053
Why would anyone post these?

58:29.137 --> 58:30.655
I don't know what happened.

58:31.689 --> 58:33.467
Someone commented,

58:33.551 --> 58:36.640
"Why does her face looks like a screw?"

58:36.724 --> 58:38.260
That's just cruel.

58:38.344 --> 58:40.674
Well, I couldn't see out of my eyelashes

58:40.758 --> 58:42.743
because they were massive,
and my heels were dangerous--

58:42.827 --> 58:44.295
But those legs,

58:44.379 --> 58:45.950
- look good, girl.
- They do.

58:46.034 --> 58:47.398
I'm sure Jeremiah thought so, too.

58:47.482 --> 58:48.724
Hey, you.

58:50.896 --> 58:52.640
- Hi.
- Hi.

58:52.724 --> 58:54.467
Um, are you ready?

58:54.551 --> 58:55.950
Dress rehearsal is about to start.

58:56.034 --> 58:58.655
- Yeah. I will be right there.
- Okay.

58:59.689 --> 59:01.000
Bye.

59:02.241 --> 59:04.157
He is so fine.

59:04.241 --> 59:05.812
Well, he is kind of cute.

59:05.896 --> 59:07.172
Mmm-hmm.

59:14.034 --> 59:15.172
Grace.

59:17.620 --> 59:18.536
What is this?

59:18.620 --> 59:20.984
Uh, hmm.

59:21.068 --> 59:22.275
Is that Willow?

59:23.413 --> 59:25.019
Well, sir, I--

59:25.103 --> 59:26.517
When was this taken?

59:27.206 --> 59:30.674
Um, just, uh--

59:30.758 --> 59:32.758
So, this is Dante?

59:35.448 --> 59:37.743
And, Lord, we pray that tomorrow,

59:37.827 --> 59:40.191
our voices glorify your name.
Amen.

59:40.275 --> 59:41.950
- Amen. Amen.
- Amen.

59:42.034 --> 59:43.881
Hey, let me just say you,
worked your ass--

59:43.965 --> 59:45.329
- Church. Church, baby. Church.
- I...

59:45.413 --> 59:47.536
What I meant to say was,

59:47.620 --> 59:49.916
I am so very proud of each of you

59:50.000 --> 59:51.329
- and proud to be a part of--
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

59:51.413 --> 59:52.571
Okay, that's great.
But listen,

59:52.655 --> 59:54.605
your call time tomorrow
is 10:00 a.m., okay?

59:54.689 --> 59:56.467
You need to be here, on time.

59:56.551 --> 59:57.709
The doors will open at 3:00,

59:57.793 --> 59:59.019
the show starts at 4:00 on the dot.

59:59.103 --> 01:00:00.467
We will start without you.

01:00:00.551 --> 01:00:02.674
So be here. Okay?
Have a good night.

01:00:02.758 --> 01:00:05.467
- Grace and peace, y'all.
- Yeah. Grace and peace.

01:00:05.551 --> 01:00:06.502
- Hey.
- Yeah?

01:00:06.586 --> 01:00:07.881
We did it. Oh, we did it.

01:00:07.965 --> 01:00:09.122
- Okay.
- No, you did good.

01:00:09.206 --> 01:00:12.896
The congregation is in
for a treat tomorrow.

01:00:14.206 --> 01:00:15.295
Daddy, what's wrong?

01:00:15.379 --> 01:00:16.517
Close the door, Willow.

01:00:20.931 --> 01:00:22.398
Is everything okay?

01:00:22.482 --> 01:00:25.226
I saw Grace looking at pictures of you

01:00:25.310 --> 01:00:27.034
performing at Dante's concert.

01:00:28.620 --> 01:00:30.448
- Daddy, I can explain.
- Can you?

01:00:31.896 --> 01:00:33.536
Because I distinctly remember us

01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:35.467
having a conversation
about what would happen

01:00:35.551 --> 01:00:38.620
if you started singing
in nightclubs, did we not?

01:00:39.862 --> 01:00:41.620
Answer the question, Willow!

01:00:42.413 --> 01:00:43.709
I made a mistake.

01:00:43.793 --> 01:00:45.881
A mistake!

01:00:45.965 --> 01:00:47.640
You gave me your word you wouldn't do it,

01:00:47.724 --> 01:00:49.984
and you did it anyway.

01:00:50.068 --> 01:00:52.103
- And I am sorry.
- Me, too.

01:00:53.965 --> 01:00:55.536
Minister Terry,

01:00:55.620 --> 01:00:57.191
you are relieved of your duties

01:00:57.275 --> 01:00:59.709
at Trinity Church effective immediately.

01:00:59.793 --> 01:01:02.605
Turn in your badge and keys
before you leave tonight.

01:01:02.689 --> 01:01:04.812
Daddy, that is not fair.
I didn't even--

01:01:04.896 --> 01:01:07.689
Go do whatever music
you wanna go do, Willow.

01:01:20.172 --> 01:01:21.433
I can talk to him.

01:01:21.517 --> 01:01:22.743
He's not gonna change his mind.

01:01:22.827 --> 01:01:24.364
We have to at least try.

01:01:24.448 --> 01:01:25.916
He's too stubborn for that.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.743
Where do you think
I get it from?

01:01:27.827 --> 01:01:30.502
I did exactly what he asked me
not to do, right?

01:01:30.586 --> 01:01:31.916
I deserve to get fired.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.984
Willow, you're a gospel artist.

01:01:35.068 --> 01:01:37.398
Performing in that show
only confirmed it even more,

01:01:37.482 --> 01:01:38.847
that is where your heart is.

01:01:38.931 --> 01:01:41.398
But I still performed in the show,

01:01:41.482 --> 01:01:43.413
when I told him
I wouldn't even audition.

01:01:44.344 --> 01:01:45.467
What are you all doing here?

01:01:45.551 --> 01:01:47.088
Now is not a good time, Dante.

01:01:47.172 --> 01:01:49.226
Whatever. Oh.

01:01:49.310 --> 01:01:51.433
We got a show tomorrow night
in Atlantic City.

01:01:51.517 --> 01:01:53.467
- On Christmas Eve?
- Yup.

01:01:53.551 --> 01:01:55.467
Buses roll out at 8:00 a.m.

01:01:55.551 --> 01:01:57.743
I'm not leaving this close to Christmas.

01:01:57.827 --> 01:01:59.295
Yes, you are.

01:01:59.379 --> 01:02:01.034
I guess you didn't read your contract.

01:02:04.103 --> 01:02:06.019
The jubilee is tomorrow night

01:02:06.103 --> 01:02:08.088
and the entire church will be there.

01:02:08.172 --> 01:02:09.329
I know.

01:02:09.413 --> 01:02:11.950
And the show must go on,
but the show cannot go on

01:02:12.034 --> 01:02:13.743
without me and you.

01:02:13.827 --> 01:02:15.000
I know.

01:02:22.724 --> 01:02:25.467
- I just--
- I know.

01:02:25.551 --> 01:02:26.950
I know, Ma. I know. I know.

01:02:27.034 --> 01:02:28.709
Look, I promise

01:02:28.793 --> 01:02:31.743
I won't stay away that long ever again.

01:02:31.827 --> 01:02:34.260
Well, I packed you a small lunch

01:02:34.344 --> 01:02:36.916
just for the bus today
when you get a chance.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.260
- You didn't have to do that.
- Oh, it's nothing,

01:02:39.344 --> 01:02:41.605
just some turkey and macaroni cheese,

01:02:41.689 --> 01:02:43.364
mashed potatoes, black eyed peas,

01:02:43.448 --> 01:02:44.812
collard greens, that's all.

01:02:44.896 --> 01:02:46.758
Uh, what, no dessert?

01:02:48.689 --> 01:02:50.295
I forgot the dessert.
I'll be right back.

01:02:50.379 --> 01:02:52.310
No, wait. Ma. No.
I was just kid...

01:02:59.724 --> 01:03:01.068
Um...

01:03:02.758 --> 01:03:05.000
Well,
I'll see you around, then.

01:03:05.965 --> 01:03:07.068
Next time.

01:03:08.344 --> 01:03:10.000
Yeah. Next time.

01:03:15.241 --> 01:03:16.793
Pop, you think, um...

01:03:18.965 --> 01:03:21.226
You think we could ever get things back

01:03:21.310 --> 01:03:23.536
to the way they were between us

01:03:23.620 --> 01:03:26.433
before I went on the road with...

01:03:26.517 --> 01:03:28.191
Without all this awkwardness?

01:03:28.275 --> 01:03:29.620
I hope so.

01:03:30.827 --> 01:03:32.827
I don't like feeling like
my son is a stranger.

01:03:33.724 --> 01:03:34.931
Well, if you would...

01:03:39.689 --> 01:03:41.896
I wish I could have been
a better son to you.

01:03:43.931 --> 01:03:45.984
And I'm sorry that
I stayed away for so long

01:03:46.068 --> 01:03:48.812
and made you feel like we couldn't talk

01:03:48.896 --> 01:03:51.571
or that I didn't want talk to you,

01:03:51.655 --> 01:03:53.482
because that wasn't the case.

01:03:55.586 --> 01:03:56.827
I just...

01:03:58.448 --> 01:04:01.053
Sometimes I feel like
you wanted me to fail.

01:04:01.137 --> 01:04:02.916
Why would I ever want you to fail?

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:06.724
When I wanted to pursue
music full on, you just...

01:04:11.034 --> 01:04:14.862
I just wanted you to be
proud of me. That's all.

01:04:17.896 --> 01:04:19.950
You don't think
I'm proud of you?

01:04:20.034 --> 01:04:21.275
Huh?

01:04:32.827 --> 01:04:33.965
Open it.

01:04:35.655 --> 01:04:37.275
Go on. Open it.

01:04:50.241 --> 01:04:51.379
Wait.

01:04:55.655 --> 01:04:58.206
There's a few more upstairs
just like this.

01:04:59.482 --> 01:05:02.103
I made one from when you were a baby and...

01:05:06.965 --> 01:05:09.674
When the doctors told us that we may never

01:05:09.758 --> 01:05:11.275
be able to have kids

01:05:12.586 --> 01:05:14.536
from the time your mama told me

01:05:14.620 --> 01:05:16.448
that she was having my baby boy

01:05:17.896 --> 01:05:20.172
until they bury me in the ground.

01:05:22.793 --> 01:05:25.103
I will always be proud of you.

01:05:32.862 --> 01:05:35.329
I packed three pieces of peach cobbler.

01:05:35.413 --> 01:05:36.586
I hope it's enough.

01:05:38.689 --> 01:05:40.344
This is more than enough.

01:05:42.103 --> 01:05:45.793
Don't stay gone for so long
next time, okay?

01:05:50.448 --> 01:05:51.689
I won't, Pop.

01:06:06.793 --> 01:06:08.847
I thought we said our goodbyes last night.

01:06:08.931 --> 01:06:11.433
Well, I wanted to bring you
your Christmas presents

01:06:11.517 --> 01:06:13.709
since you won't be around
the open them tomorrow.

01:06:13.793 --> 01:06:15.433
Uh, but don't open it yet.

01:06:15.517 --> 01:06:18.620
Just wait till you're at least
in Philly or something.

01:06:21.275 --> 01:06:22.743
You gotta save the jubilee,
Willow.

01:06:22.827 --> 01:06:24.640
Talk to Bishop.

01:06:24.724 --> 01:06:27.655
You got to at least try.
Please?

01:06:28.827 --> 01:06:31.191
You put in a lot of work
for this performance,

01:06:31.275 --> 01:06:32.379
and you...

01:06:34.310 --> 01:06:35.448
Ministry.

01:06:36.965 --> 01:06:38.275
Don't let it be in vain.

01:06:40.620 --> 01:06:42.053
Do it for me?

01:06:42.137 --> 01:06:43.241
For you?

01:06:44.517 --> 01:06:46.605
Hmm, I don't know about that,
but I might do it for me.

01:06:49.103 --> 01:06:50.984
Thank you for the push.

01:06:51.068 --> 01:06:52.137
Of course.

01:07:10.379 --> 01:07:11.551
Goodbye, Willow.

01:07:29.310 --> 01:07:31.157
I'm so sorry, Willow.
Are you okay?

01:07:31.241 --> 01:07:32.743
Grace, I'm fine, okay?

01:07:32.827 --> 01:07:34.329
I panicked.
I didn't know what to say.

01:07:34.413 --> 01:07:36.226
You know I can't lie to a man
of God on holy grounds.

01:07:36.310 --> 01:07:37.709
Grace, we're good, okay?

01:07:37.793 --> 01:07:39.295
- Just stop.
- I can fix it.

01:07:39.379 --> 01:07:41.674
I will just march up to him right now and...

01:07:41.758 --> 01:07:44.088
Oh, gosh. He's still
contemplating my raise.

01:07:44.172 --> 01:07:45.295
Uh, what do you want me to say?

01:07:45.379 --> 01:07:46.709
Grace, just stop.

01:07:46.793 --> 01:07:48.000
Where's my father?

01:07:49.344 --> 01:07:50.965
- He's in his office.
- Thank you.

01:07:55.310 --> 01:07:56.482
Yes, Brenda.

01:07:58.172 --> 01:08:00.206
Yes, I agree.

01:08:01.413 --> 01:08:02.812
He would never slip on ice again

01:08:02.896 --> 01:08:04.433
if you all move to Georgia.

01:08:04.517 --> 01:08:05.517
Yeah.

01:08:08.931 --> 01:08:10.275
Uh, Brenda...

01:08:12.620 --> 01:08:15.275
Br... Brenda.
Brenda, I gotta go.

01:08:15.931 --> 01:08:17.241
My daughter just walked in.

01:08:19.137 --> 01:08:20.157
Hey, Daddy.

01:08:20.241 --> 01:08:21.275
Willow.

01:08:23.793 --> 01:08:25.000
I know I messed up.

01:08:26.068 --> 01:08:27.571
I defied you

01:08:27.655 --> 01:08:29.862
and went to that audition
behind your back.

01:08:31.206 --> 01:08:34.881
But I am not a little girl anymore.

01:08:34.965 --> 01:08:37.191
And the way that you see me and treat me

01:08:37.275 --> 01:08:39.122
like I'm some puppet that you can control

01:08:39.206 --> 01:08:40.881
and dispose of,

01:08:40.965 --> 01:08:42.536
it has to stop.

01:08:42.620 --> 01:08:44.502
- Willow, I--
- Daddy, hear me out.

01:08:44.586 --> 01:08:47.709
All my life,
I have done what you say,

01:08:47.793 --> 01:08:49.502
when you say, and how you say it,

01:08:49.586 --> 01:08:52.571
and I don't make a fuss
because I love what I do.

01:08:52.655 --> 01:08:56.000
I would sing into a tin can in a
parking lot just to make music.

01:08:58.241 --> 01:08:59.758
But you're suffocating me.

01:09:01.862 --> 01:09:04.778
And, yes,
I went to the audition

01:09:04.862 --> 01:09:06.950
because I wanted to know
what it would feel like

01:09:07.034 --> 01:09:09.122
to be free enough to make my own decisions

01:09:09.206 --> 01:09:10.743
without having you in the back of my head

01:09:10.827 --> 01:09:13.448
telling me when and where I can sing.

01:09:14.482 --> 01:09:16.000
And do you know what I decided?

01:09:17.103 --> 01:09:18.965
Did you bothered to ask me?

01:09:20.655 --> 01:09:23.241
Is that that's not the kind
of music I wanna sing.

01:09:25.379 --> 01:09:28.536
I wanna make music
that lifts up Jesus' name,

01:09:28.620 --> 01:09:30.295
that breaks depression of His people,

01:09:30.379 --> 01:09:32.000
that gives them hope.

01:09:33.103 --> 01:09:35.310
And not because you've chosen that for me,

01:09:36.551 --> 01:09:40.000
but because I had a choice, and I chose.

01:09:45.103 --> 01:09:45.965
You're right.

01:09:47.310 --> 01:09:48.827
Say what?
Tell me more about that.

01:09:49.827 --> 01:09:50.965
You're right.

01:09:54.103 --> 01:09:57.620
I will always see you as my little girl,

01:10:00.689 --> 01:10:02.793
but you get to make your own decisions.

01:10:04.896 --> 01:10:07.413
I'm sorry it's taken me
so long to see that.

01:10:09.275 --> 01:10:10.881
It's okay.

01:10:10.965 --> 01:10:13.709
I forgive you because I know you're old.

01:10:22.793 --> 01:10:25.950
Now, about this jubilee.

01:10:26.034 --> 01:10:28.019
Willow, you can have your job back.

01:10:28.103 --> 01:10:30.019
No, yeah. I knew that.
Of course, I knew that.

01:10:30.103 --> 01:10:33.226
But, um,
I'm gonna need a favor.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.433
We need to go back
to playing the major venues.

01:10:39.517 --> 01:10:40.984
I'm tired of these small towns.

01:10:41.068 --> 01:10:42.916
I couldn't even find a decent
restaurant out there.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:44.364
I hear you loud and clear.

01:10:44.448 --> 01:10:45.571
I'm working on it.

01:10:45.655 --> 01:10:47.191
This next show is going to help.

01:10:47.275 --> 01:10:48.862
- I hope so.
- I'm on it.

01:10:52.137 --> 01:10:54.191
- Yes.
- All right.

01:10:54.275 --> 01:10:55.536
We get off the bus,

01:10:55.620 --> 01:10:57.295
you'd better have my barber on standby.

01:10:57.379 --> 01:10:58.916
Don't worry about a thing.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:00.088
This next show is going to be great

01:11:00.172 --> 01:11:02.812
I'll have the barber
standing by as soon as...

01:11:02.896 --> 01:11:03.847
Yeah.

01:11:11.689 --> 01:11:13.502
Hey. Hey.

01:11:13.586 --> 01:11:14.605
I need to get off.

01:11:14.689 --> 01:11:15.605
I need to go back home.

01:11:15.689 --> 01:11:16.950
What?

01:11:17.034 --> 01:11:18.571
In case there was any confusion,

01:11:18.655 --> 01:11:19.640
I just quit.

01:11:19.724 --> 01:11:21.019
Are you sure about that?

01:11:21.103 --> 01:11:22.674
I'm definitely sure.

01:11:22.758 --> 01:11:24.157
I have never been more sure about anything

01:11:24.241 --> 01:11:25.413
in my entire life.

01:11:26.379 --> 01:11:27.536
- Hey, Peter.
- Yeah.

01:11:27.620 --> 01:11:28.984
Drop me off at the next town.

01:11:35.896 --> 01:11:37.172
Great. No service.

01:11:52.413 --> 01:11:53.551
You look beautiful.

01:11:54.655 --> 01:11:55.950
Don't forget to breathe.

01:11:56.034 --> 01:11:57.000
Okay.

01:12:06.896 --> 01:12:09.379
Merry Christmas to you and your families.

01:12:10.655 --> 01:12:14.364
I want to welcome you to Trinity Church's

01:12:14.448 --> 01:12:17.413
annual Christmas jubilee.

01:12:19.517 --> 01:12:21.329
I wanna thank everyone that's had a hand

01:12:21.413 --> 01:12:22.502
in tonight's production.

01:12:22.586 --> 01:12:23.674
What in the world?

01:12:23.758 --> 01:12:24.724
To Minister Eddie.

01:12:26.620 --> 01:12:29.433
- Jeremiah White.
- My son worked hard on this.

01:12:29.517 --> 01:12:31.019
- My assistant...
- I couldn't miss it.

01:12:31.103 --> 01:12:32.674
- Grace.
- And you promised me cookies

01:12:32.758 --> 01:12:35.881
if I came to church, so I came to collect.

01:12:35.965 --> 01:12:38.053
- Thank you, sweetheart.
- But I'd also like to acknowledge

01:12:38.137 --> 01:12:40.019
the contributions and sacrifices

01:12:40.103 --> 01:12:43.103
to this house of a special individual,

01:12:43.931 --> 01:12:44.931
and to thank her.

01:12:47.103 --> 01:12:50.206
I don't always get it right.

01:12:52.103 --> 01:12:54.433
And it's come to my attention
that I can be

01:12:54.517 --> 01:12:57.398
too suffocating to those I love.

01:12:57.482 --> 01:12:59.413
I hold onto them too tight.

01:13:01.241 --> 01:13:02.517
But tonight,

01:13:04.172 --> 01:13:06.172
I would like you to watch...

01:13:07.689 --> 01:13:11.724
my daughter, my baby,

01:13:12.482 --> 01:13:19.172
Willow Denise Terry Swords.

01:13:24.517 --> 01:13:25.793
Thank you, Daddy.

01:13:27.206 --> 01:13:30.793
We put blood, sweat, and tears
into this production.

01:13:31.689 --> 01:13:33.448
And we pray that you are blessed,

01:13:34.310 --> 01:13:35.847
that your families are blessed,

01:13:35.931 --> 01:13:38.916
that your children are blessed
and their children.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:40.295
Daddy, I could use
a little help on this one,

01:13:40.379 --> 01:13:41.295
if you don't mind.

01:13:41.379 --> 01:13:42.379

He gave me a seven percent
salary increase.

01:15:30.517 --> 01:15:31.916
Okay, well, praise God.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:33.812
Won't he do it?

01:15:40.275 --> 01:15:41.379
Willow.

01:15:54.827 --> 01:15:57.398
What in the world are you doing here?

01:15:57.482 --> 01:16:00.137

I'd sing a song with her.

Okay.

01:19:02.241 --> 01:19:03.068
This is for you.

01:19:09.344 --> 01:19:10.482
It won't bite.

01:19:17.896 --> 01:19:20.295
That was good.
That was a good one.

01:19:20.379 --> 01:19:22.847
I realized those mean a lot to you.

01:19:22.931 --> 01:19:25.812
And I'll stop taking them from now on

01:19:25.896 --> 01:19:28.172
so you can continue your long tradition.

01:19:28.931 --> 01:19:31.310
And I'm sorry.

01:19:32.068 --> 01:19:33.034
Come here.

01:19:38.758 --> 01:19:40.847
Thank you, neighbor.

01:19:40.931 --> 01:19:42.605
You're welcome, neighbor.

01:19:42.689 --> 01:19:44.847
- Oh, let's see it again.
- Yeah. I know.

01:19:44.931 --> 01:19:47.122
Oh.

01:19:47.206 --> 01:19:50.019
That is the ugliest thing
I've ever seen.

01:19:50.103 --> 01:19:51.019
Yay.

01:19:54.862 --> 01:19:56.743
Oh, sweetheart,
I'm so proud of you.

01:19:56.827 --> 01:19:58.605
Okay. All right.

01:19:58.689 --> 01:20:00.068
I have...

01:20:01.551 --> 01:20:03.000
something for you, Willow.

01:20:04.517 --> 01:20:07.467
So, um, I sent your song
to a friend of mine

01:20:07.551 --> 01:20:10.000
and this was her response.

01:20:11.206 --> 01:20:12.172
Open it.

01:20:13.551 --> 01:20:14.551
Ooh.

01:20:15.655 --> 01:20:17.413
- Ooh.
- Okay.

01:20:21.241 --> 01:20:23.088
"Dear Willow,

01:20:23.172 --> 01:20:25.778
Jeremiah was kind enough
to send us your record

01:20:25.862 --> 01:20:28.916
and I just wanted to say you blew us away.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:30.916
God gave you something
special in those pipes,

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:32.551
you truly have a gift.

01:20:35.517 --> 01:20:37.758
Please have your lawyer...

01:20:39.206 --> 01:20:41.743
look over the attached
contract and follow up

01:20:41.827 --> 01:20:43.172
if you have any questions.

01:20:45.172 --> 01:20:46.605
We'd love to get started

01:20:46.689 --> 01:20:48.655
on recording your gospel album soon.

01:20:49.896 --> 01:20:51.344
Merry Christmas."

01:20:54.379 --> 01:20:56.605
Is this...
Is this what I think it is?

01:20:56.689 --> 01:20:57.586
Yes.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:00.605
Willow, they're asking you

01:21:00.689 --> 01:21:03.984
to be a gospel recording
artist on their label.

01:21:04.068 --> 01:21:05.034
Mmm-hmm.

01:21:07.965 --> 01:21:08.965
So...

01:21:09.931 --> 01:21:11.103
is that a yes?

01:21:11.931 --> 01:21:13.034
Uh...

01:21:14.448 --> 01:21:15.467
Yes.

01:21:15.551 --> 01:21:16.640
- Yes. Yes.
- Yes?

01:21:16.724 --> 01:21:17.640
- Yes.
- This is a...

01:21:17.724 --> 01:21:19.260
- Yes, yes.
- Okay.

01:21:19.344 --> 01:21:21.329
Oh, my gosh. Yes, yes, yes.

01:21:21.413 --> 01:21:22.226
Y'all heard me.

01:21:22.310 --> 01:21:23.709
Yes, yes, yes.

01:21:24.965 --> 01:21:27.571
Willow, you are an official

01:21:27.655 --> 01:21:29.157
gospel recording artist.

01:21:29.241 --> 01:21:31.295
- Mmm-hmm.
- Thank you.

01:21:31.379 --> 01:21:32.398
Come here.

01:21:32.482 --> 01:21:33.674
- Thank you.
- Oh.

01:21:33.758 --> 01:21:35.053
You're the best. Thank you.

01:21:35.137 --> 01:21:36.571
- I know. Tell me again.
- No, no, no.

01:21:36.655 --> 01:21:39.191
Just one time. Just one time.

01:21:39.275 --> 01:21:40.847
Jeremiah.

01:21:40.931 --> 01:21:44.068
We have so much
to celebrate this Christmas.

01:21:45.103 --> 01:21:46.502
Willow's making a album

01:21:46.586 --> 01:21:48.191
and Jeremiah's...

01:21:48.275 --> 01:21:51.053
Is unemployed, but home.
Yes, I am.

01:21:51.137 --> 01:21:52.812
Well...

01:21:52.896 --> 01:21:55.812
seems my minister of music

01:21:55.896 --> 01:21:58.433
has relocated to Georgia

01:21:58.517 --> 01:22:02.605
and my daughter is now officially

01:22:02.689 --> 01:22:05.467
a gospel music recording artist.

01:22:05.551 --> 01:22:08.088
So, she's unavailable,

01:22:08.172 --> 01:22:09.620
but I still need a new one.

01:22:11.137 --> 01:22:12.344
Job is yours if you want it, son.

01:22:14.206 --> 01:22:16.571
I... I'd love to.

01:22:16.655 --> 01:22:17.881
I'd be honored, Bishop.

01:22:17.965 --> 01:22:19.536
Yes, of course. Thank you.

01:22:19.620 --> 01:22:20.778
Thank you.

01:22:20.862 --> 01:22:22.536
Oh, oh. But, um,

01:22:22.620 --> 01:22:24.329
there is a new artist

01:22:24.413 --> 01:22:28.260
who's gonna need your help with her music.

01:22:28.344 --> 01:22:30.226
So, uh, he needs to be able to make music

01:22:30.310 --> 01:22:31.295
outside of Trinity.

01:22:31.379 --> 01:22:32.640
What she said.

01:22:34.448 --> 01:22:35.536
That's fair.

01:22:35.620 --> 01:22:36.551
Seems fair.

01:22:38.068 --> 01:22:41.122
Go make whatever music
you need to make, son.

01:22:41.206 --> 01:22:42.433
Thank you.

01:22:45.172 --> 01:22:46.812
Seems like I'll be seeing

01:22:46.896 --> 01:22:49.088
a lot more of you now,
Minister Jeremiah.

01:22:49.172 --> 01:22:51.916
Uh-uh. No, I'll just still go
by Jeremiah, okay?

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.724
But it does seem that way.

01:22:56.034 --> 01:22:58.984
And, uh, maybe we could,

01:22:59.068 --> 01:23:00.881
I don't know, intentionally start

01:23:00.965 --> 01:23:02.448
spending some time together.

01:23:03.862 --> 01:23:05.502
- Maybe we could.
- Uh-huh.

01:23:05.586 --> 01:23:06.674
Yeah.

01:23:06.758 --> 01:23:09.122
Maybe we could, uh, a movie?

01:23:09.206 --> 01:23:10.517
- The park?
- Ah.

01:23:11.586 --> 01:23:13.847
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah, yeah, ice skating?

01:23:13.931 --> 01:23:16.640
Yeah. Just nowhere
that involves a tour bus.

01:23:16.724 --> 01:23:18.191
Or a church.

01:23:18.275 --> 01:23:19.275
Oof.

01:23:20.103 --> 01:23:21.122
- Deal.
- Deal.

01:23:21.206 --> 01:23:24.000
Oh, just go ahead and kiss
her already, sweetheart.

01:23:32.068 --> 01:23:36.364
Could we please, please,

01:23:36.448 --> 01:23:37.620
open the presents.
It's Christmas.

01:23:38.551 --> 01:23:40.640
Let's do it.
Open the presents.

01:23:40.724 --> 01:23:41.812
All right.

01:23:43.034 --> 01:23:44.467
Let's do this.

01:23:44.551 --> 01:23:45.812
This recording artist.

01:23:45.896 --> 01:23:47.019
Oh, my gosh. Okay.

01:23:48.275 --> 01:23:49.413
I have something.
