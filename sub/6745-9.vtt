I can relate
to some of that.

is officially single,

our divorce settlement,

[Inhales] big, deep breaths.

20:48.848 --> 20:50.114
Count to 10.

We need you
to try and pull it together.

20:52.819 --> 20:55.953
Using a GPS tracker
to follow your husband?

20:55.955 --> 20:57.321
Is no one safe?

20:57.323 --> 20:58.422
It's not GPS.

20:58.424 --> 21:00.958
It's a Bluetooth
crowdsourcing locator.

21:00.960 --> 21:04.262
Well, what the hell is a
Bluetooth crowd control locator?

21:04.264 --> 21:06.564
Not crowd control.
Crowdsourcing.

21:06.566 --> 21:07.965
Bluetooth has
a limited range,

21:07.967 --> 21:09.600
so it has to hop
on to other apps.

21:09.602 --> 21:11.202
Before I go on,

21:11.204 --> 21:12.970
do you really care
about this answer?

21:12.972 --> 21:16.641
Excellent point.
I'm very good at crowd control.

21:16.643 --> 21:18.175
Crowdsourcing.
Whatever.

21:18.177 --> 21:22.280
<i> Okay.</i>
<i> Let's get this over with.</i>

21:22.282 --> 21:25.583

ever introduced you to this man?

21:25.585 --> 21:27.051
No. Why?

21:27.053 --> 21:28.686
Because the vehicle
in which we found

21:28.688 --> 21:30.121
your husband's body
belonged to him.

21:30.123 --> 21:31.856
And we have reason
to believe

21:31.858 --> 21:35.660
Max may have met up with
this man at an area motel.

21:35.662 --> 21:38.629

21:42.001 --> 21:43.901
Is that even
a possibility?

21:43.903 --> 21:46.470
I don't think so, no.

21:46.472 --> 21:48.873
Max wasn't gay.

21:48.875 --> 21:51.175
He loved women.

21:51.177 --> 21:53.811
Just not me.

21:53.813 --> 21:57.481
Unless Max's wife
is confessing,

21:57.483 --> 21:59.750
maybe you should see
what else was in the Tahoe.

21:59.752 --> 22:01.285
What'd you find?

22:01.287 --> 22:03.287
In addition to the hockey bag
with Max Riley's body,

22:03.289 --> 22:05.523
the original bloody sheets
from the motel.

22:05.525 --> 22:08.826
John price was so disorganized
that the contents of his Tahoe

22:08.828 --> 22:10.995
created a picture
of who he was.

22:10.997 --> 22:14.465
Does this picture
include an address?

22:14.467 --> 22:16.901
Well, not exactly,
but starting over here,

22:16.903 --> 22:18.936
we have a collection
of used appliance parts,

22:18.938 --> 22:20.771
motors,
gas connectors.

22:20.773 --> 22:24.942
A pair of coveralls, a tool set,
several screwdrivers, ma'am.

this card supposed to be

22:26.913 --> 22:28.279

written on it?

22:28.281 --> 22:29.814
Oh, that was taped
to the sun visor

22:29.816 --> 22:31.315
on the driver's side
of the Tahoe.

22:31.317 --> 22:33.484
81329084.

22:33.486 --> 22:35.953
Could be a password
or an access code to something.

22:35.955 --> 22:37.388
Hmm, either/or.

22:37.390 --> 22:39.056
But what it gives us access to,
I'm not sure.

22:39.058 --> 22:42.159
Maybe the garage to his
apartment building or office.

22:42.161 --> 22:44.395
Everything
that we're looking at here

22:44.397 --> 22:48.132
suggests that price worked
in some kind of repair shop,

22:48.134 --> 22:50.935
and there are hundreds of those
in Los Angeles.

22:50.937 --> 22:53.270
Which brings us
over here.

22:53.272 --> 22:55.806
Fast food to-go bags,
tao?

22:55.808 --> 22:57.408
Well,
not just to-go bags.

22:57.410 --> 23:01.479
To-go receipts --
approximately 125 of them.

23:01.481 --> 23:03.481
Now, this is
where it gets interesting.

23:03.483 --> 23:06.050
Oh. This is the moment
I've been waiting for.

23:06.052 --> 23:08.419
The majority of the receipts --
87 of them --

23:08.421 --> 23:10.354
belonged to Pedro's
panini truck.

23:10.356 --> 23:14.024
And they're time-stamped
from 11:45 A.M. to 12:30 P.M.

23:14.026 --> 23:15.760
John price ate
from the same food truck

23:15.762 --> 23:17.094
every day
around the same time?

23:17.096 --> 23:18.396
And food trucks
drive around.

23:18.398 --> 23:20.030
Well, maybe Mr. price
lived or worked

23:20.032 --> 23:21.499
on Pedro's route,
ma'am.

23:21.501 --> 23:23.401
Which I have marked
on this map here

23:23.403 --> 23:26.003
with these tiny, little flags,
each one indicating a stop

23:26.005 --> 23:30.875
on Pedro's route between
11:15 A.M. and 2:45 P.M.

and a couple of patrol cars

23:33.513 --> 23:36.380
and search the area
where the food truck stopped,

23:36.382 --> 23:39.083
and let's hope
that the number on this card

23:39.085 --> 23:41.852
corresponds to an access code
of something.

23:42.955 --> 23:46.257
[ Sighs ]
Doctor, what a surprise.

23:46.259 --> 23:48.626
Isn't it? I was across the
street testifying at a trial,

23:48.628 --> 23:51.028
and I figured I'd bring
the good news to you in person.

23:51.030 --> 23:52.830
Good news?
What good news?

23:52.832 --> 23:54.231
As you suspected,

23:54.233 --> 23:56.500
your second victim
was killed like your first --

23:56.502 --> 23:59.103
a Phillips head screwdriver
to the base of the skull.

23:59.105 --> 24:03.207
But when the screwdriver
entered Max Riley's neck,

24:03.209 --> 24:05.509
it severed the segment
of his upper spinal cord

24:05.511 --> 24:07.912
connecting his brain
to the rest of his body,

24:07.914 --> 24:10.548
stopped his autonomic
nervous system cold.

24:10.550 --> 24:12.917
Do you think
the killer was aiming

24:12.919 --> 24:15.386
for that segment
of the spinal cord?

24:15.388 --> 24:16.754
I don't know.

24:16.756 --> 24:18.789
But an inch to the left or right
and you'd miss it altogether,

24:18.791 --> 24:21.859
which might explain why the
first victim was left behind.

24:21.861 --> 24:23.861
Killer was assuming
he couldn't move.

24:23.863 --> 24:24.995
Exactly.

24:24.997 --> 24:26.497
So the killer
took Max out,

24:26.499 --> 24:28.866
planning on returning
for the second victim.

24:28.868 --> 24:30.401
But the killer
didn't return

24:30.403 --> 24:34.004
because maybe he saw
that victim on the YouTube

<i> And I'm not making excuses,</i>

32:04.089 --> 32:05.622
Here come the excuses.

32:05.624 --> 32:09.026
...I was young, I was immature,
and Gretchen was --

32:09.028 --> 32:10.127
available?

32:10.129 --> 32:11.495
More than available.

32:11.497 --> 32:13.196
I was working
for her dad.

32:13.198 --> 32:16.366
She'd come by a couple times a
week just to have lunch with me,

32:16.368 --> 32:18.902
and she was --
she was really hot, you know?

32:18.904 --> 32:21.705
Then we started renting
motel rooms now and then --

32:21.707 --> 32:25.375
until Ms. Tucker
tried to kill you.

32:26.378 --> 32:28.512
She asked if I loved her.

32:28.514 --> 32:30.714
I thought
she was kidding.

32:30.716 --> 32:32.215

<i> I was married.</i>

32:32.217 --> 32:33.850

<i> several times.</i>

<i> I mean, it was just</i>
<i> fun and games,</i>

32:35.421 --> 32:37.321
so when she asked
if I loved her...

32:37.323 --> 32:39.022
You said no.

32:39.024 --> 32:40.257
Apparently.

32:40.259 --> 32:41.558
<i> I couldn't see her face</i>

32:41.560 --> 32:43.193

where the screwdriver came from.

32:46.465 --> 32:47.965
And it wasn't just
the fact

32:47.967 --> 32:50.033
that she tried to stab me
in the head.

32:50.035 --> 32:52.803
It was the screaming,
that I lied to her, I used her.

32:52.805 --> 32:55.205
I had to punch her
in the face

32:55.207 --> 32:58.375
just to get out of there and
drive myself to the hospital.

32:58.377 --> 33:00.811
So you made up the story
about the homeless guy.

33:00.813 --> 33:02.946
Look, I-I didn't want my wife
to find out.

33:02.948 --> 33:05.415
But more than that,
Gretchen...

She was Tucker's daughter.

I could either be arrested

33:09.922 --> 33:11.688

or I could quit

recommendation.

have done?

Doug Martin said,

35:07.206 --> 35:08.505
you murdered
these gentlemen

35:08.507 --> 35:09.906
when they wouldn't say
they loved you.

No, her ex-husband loved her
very much.

35:13.345 --> 35:14.878

No.

35:25.057 --> 35:26.957
After you murdered
these three men,

35:26.959 --> 35:29.826
your ex-husband disposed of
their bodies and the evidence.

35:29.828 --> 35:31.728
He loved you enough
to do all that,

35:31.730 --> 35:34.097
and you killed him anyway --
why?

35:34.099 --> 35:37.634
I'm gonna guess that
it's because your ex-husband

35:37.636 --> 35:39.870
kept all your former boyfriends
on ice

35:39.872 --> 35:42.539
so he could blackmail you
with their bodies.
