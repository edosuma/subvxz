<i>In the last 50 years,
we've doubled our population,</i>

01:23.420 --> 01:26.254
<i>tripled the amount of food and water we use,</i>

01:26.337 --> 01:30.379
<i>and we have quadrupled
the use of fossil fuels.</i>

01:31.670 --> 01:34.338
<i>Every four days, there's a million
more people on the planet.</i>

01:35.462 --> 01:38.879
<i>How is the world gonna cope
with this explosion in population?</i>

01:38.962 --> 01:41.379
<i>The UN predicts
that, by the end of the decade,</i>

01:41.462 --> 01:44.296
<i>we will have a population of ten billion.</i>

01:44.378 --> 01:46.879
<i>I am a firm believer
that climate change is real,</i>

01:47.462 --> 01:50.129
<i>that it is impacted by human behavior.</i>

01:50.212 --> 01:53.838
<i>The government has declared
most of South America a disaster zone.</i>

01:53.920 --> 01:56.588
<i>Extreme drought and massive dust storms</i>

01:56.670 --> 01:59.754
<i>have shut down
the Earth's entire agricultural system.</i>

01:59.837 --> 02:02.463
<i>Too many people, not enough food.</i>

02:02.545 --> 02:04.921
<i>In an effort to combat the food shortage,</i>

02:05.003 --> 02:08.588
<i>the European Federation has placed
the world's future in the hands of science.</i>

02:08.669 --> 02:11.213
<i>The development
of more resilient, high-yield,</i>

02:11.295 --> 02:15.296
<i>genetically modified crops
is being fast-tracked around the globe.</i>

02:16.420 --> 02:18.838
<i>Shelves once empty are now fully-stocked.</i>

02:20.003 --> 02:23.963
<i>But the tinkering with nature
has created long-term consequences.</i>

02:24.712 --> 02:27.713
<i>Across the world,
we are witnessing a staggering spike</i>

02:27.795 --> 02:31.004
<i>in multiple births and genetic defects.</i>

02:31.087 --> 02:34.004
<i>The solution is now feeding the problem.</i>

02:34.087 --> 02:36.296
<i>It is the biggest crisis in human history.</i>

02:36.378 --> 02:39.379
<i>Political activist
and renowned conservation biologist</i>

02:39.462 --> 02:42.379
Dr. Nicolette Cayman
has prompted the Federation

02:42.462 --> 02:45.629
<i>to institute a "one child per family" policy</i>

02:45.712 --> 02:48.879
<i>called the "Child Allocation Act."</i>

02:49.670 --> 02:53.171
We are one human family sharing this Earth.

02:53.253 --> 02:56.379
Today, together, we make history.

02:56.962 --> 03:01.171
The Child Allocation Act
is the first vital step

03:01.253 --> 03:03.463
towards preserving our planet

03:03.545 --> 03:06.838
and making a better future for our children.

03:06.920 --> 03:08.713
<i>New legislation has been swift.</i>

03:08.795 --> 03:11.088
<i>Check points have been
erected across the nation.</i>

03:11.170 --> 03:15.088
<i>All citizens are required to wear
a Bureau-issued identity bracelet.</i>

03:15.170 --> 03:18.754
<i>And, from this day forth,
illegally conceived siblings</i>

03:18.837 --> 03:21.754
<i>will be remanded
to Bureau-enforced cryosleep.</i>

03:21.837 --> 03:25.879
Children are more than just children.
They are the future.

03:25.962 --> 03:29.504
<i>With cryosleep, we'll make sure
your child rests peacefully,</i>

03:29.587 --> 03:33.296
humanely, free from hunger, safe from harm,

03:33.378 --> 03:36.671
<i>while we work to build
a better, brighter future.</i>

03:36.753 --> 03:37.963
<i>Cryosleep.</i>

03:39.253 --> 03:41.588
Awake to a better world.

03:41.670 --> 03:42.838
I know there's...

03:44.003 --> 03:47.254
maybe a little resistance,
but, with the "one child" policy...

03:48.670 --> 03:49.838
it may give us some time.

04:14.337 --> 04:18.171
I'm so sorry, Mr. Settman.
We did everything we could.

04:19.128 --> 04:20.838
If we were better equipped,

04:20.920 --> 04:22.963
there's a chance
we might've been able to saved her.

04:23.045 --> 04:24.129
She knew the risks.

04:27.253 --> 04:29.338
She knew you wouldn't report her.

04:32.128 --> 04:34.296
- And the father?
- Who knows?

04:34.962 --> 04:35.963
My daughter...

04:38.378 --> 04:39.838
We haven't spoken in years.

04:45.003 --> 04:47.213
How do you plan on hiding this?

04:48.753 --> 04:49.754
How will you cope?

04:51.087 --> 04:52.088
I'll manage.

04:53.712 --> 04:54.713
I'll have to.

04:57.420 --> 04:58.588
Have you thought about names?

05:05.628 --> 05:07.046
Well...

05:11.337 --> 05:12.338
There are seven.

05:14.795 --> 05:15.796
So...

05:16.462 --> 05:19.671
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,

05:19.753 --> 05:25.463
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.

05:52.920 --> 05:55.504
<i>Free from hunger, safe from harm,</i>

05:55.587 --> 05:58.421
<i>while we work to build
a better, brighter future.</i>

05:59.545 --> 06:02.296
<i>Cryosleep. Awake to a better world.</i>

06:02.837 --> 06:06.504
<i>Children are more than just children.
They are the future.</i>

06:06.587 --> 06:11.546
<i>With cryosleep, we'll make sure
your child rests peacefully, humanely.</i>

06:11.628 --> 06:14.421
<i>Please have your wristbands
ready for inspection.</i>

06:15.003 --> 06:17.879
<i>No unauthorized persons
are allowed to enter the sector.</i>

06:17.962 --> 06:20.921
<i>The following items may not be taken
through checkpoints</i>

06:21.003 --> 06:22.504
<i>without prior permission:</i>

06:22.587 --> 06:26.421
<i>any sharp objects, flammables, or chemicals.</i>

06:26.503 --> 06:27.744
<i>For your safety and security...</i>

06:50.387 --> 06:52.004
My baby!

07:00.295 --> 07:05.129
Don't take her, please! Please!
She's my child! She's my child!

07:18.587 --> 07:21.713
This sibling is now listed

07:21.795 --> 07:24.921
and will be processed under authority
of the Child Allocation Act.

07:25.003 --> 07:28.629
No! No! My baby!

07:33.003 --> 07:35.129
- My baby!
- She's my sister!

07:49.503 --> 07:50.588
Can I have that one?

08:24.753 --> 08:27.254
<i>"What happens to a dream deferred?</i>

08:27.337 --> 08:32.421
Does it dry up like a raisin in the sun,
or fester like a sore and then run?

08:32.503 --> 08:37.546
Maybe it just sags like a heavy load.
Or does it explode?"

08:37.628 --> 08:39.879
I like it. Did you write that?

08:39.962 --> 08:41.337
No, ma'am.

08:41.419 --> 08:44.713
That's the great Langston Hughes,
jazz king of Harlem.

08:45.837 --> 08:48.046
Haven't I already told you that?

08:49.170 --> 08:50.463
Must have slipped my mind.

08:52.253 --> 08:55.046
Tell me, Miss Settman, what's your secret?

08:55.128 --> 09:00.838
Last night, you're puking in the planter,
but, today, you're looking fresh as a daisy.

09:43.295 --> 09:44.296
Dinner is served.

09:45.587 --> 09:48.296
- That's interesting.
- Spreadsheets for tomorrow.

09:48.378 --> 09:50.504
I'm starving.

09:50.587 --> 09:53.671
- You are always starving.
- I think you might have worms.

09:54.053 --> 09:56.179
Oh, come on, Saturday.

09:56.795 --> 09:59.963
I hope I have worms.
We can cook them next week.

10:02.545 --> 10:04.963
- Ugh, that's gross.
- It's delicious.

10:05.712 --> 10:07.588
It's kind of beautiful.

10:07.670 --> 10:10.838
- It's a fucking rat.
- It's actually quite good.

10:10.920 --> 10:14.546
At least, it tastes like something,
unlike that engineered shit you're eating.

10:14.628 --> 10:16.963
Oh, come on, Wednesday. You'd eat anything.

10:17.628 --> 10:22.796
Deep-fried pig dick on a stick.

10:22.878 --> 10:24.796
You'd buy it and you'd eat it.

10:37.087 --> 10:38.088
Are you okay?

10:39.087 --> 10:40.504
- I'm fine.
- You seem...

10:40.587 --> 10:41.713
I know. It's just...

10:43.003 --> 10:45.088
my big presentation is tomorrow.

10:45.170 --> 10:46.338
You mean "our" presentation.

10:46.420 --> 10:48.588
No thanks to you
getting shitfaced last night.

10:49.170 --> 10:51.588
Yeah, Eddie said you threw up in the planter.

10:51.670 --> 10:54.338
I didn't know what to say.
I felt really embarrassed.

10:54.420 --> 10:56.588
I was entertaining one of our clients.

10:56.670 --> 11:00.671
I might have overdone it
on the martinis. Shoot me.

11:00.753 --> 11:04.504
You have to tell us everything, Saturday.
How can you be so stupid?

11:08.403 --> 11:12.046
I'm just tired. Tomorrow's a big day.

11:14.795 --> 11:18.254
If we get this promotion,
it's all thanks to Friday.

11:20.253 --> 11:22.421
She makes us all look like a genius.

11:23.303 --> 11:24.546
It's a team effort.

11:25.587 --> 11:29.129
You guys did the legwork.
I just crunch numbers.

11:31.128 --> 11:33.254
Seven minds are better than one.

11:36.753 --> 11:38.034
<i>You must work collectively.</i>

11:39.295 --> 11:41.963
You're stronger together than you are alone.

11:42.670 --> 11:48.046
In time, we will select a career
that capitalizes on your joint skills.

11:49.462 --> 11:52.963
What are you waiting for?
Go on, go on. Solve the problem.

12:09.587 --> 12:10.629
May I see?

12:16.587 --> 12:17.588
Very good.

13:05.045 --> 13:07.254
Go, go, go, go, go!

14:06.320 --> 14:08.404
Pay attention, girls.

14:09.087 --> 14:11.546
Tomorrow... is a big day.

14:13.587 --> 14:15.921
You know how there are
seven days in the week.

14:17.253 --> 14:19.338
Well, starting tomorrow,

14:19.420 --> 14:23.463
you will each get to go outside
on the day of the week that is your name.

14:25.337 --> 14:29.046
That means Sunday will get
to go outside on Sunday,

14:29.128 --> 14:32.213
Monday on Monday,
Tuesday on Tuesday, and so on.

14:35.628 --> 14:41.546
In here, I want you to be who you are,
dress the way you wish.

14:42.587 --> 14:45.213
I want you to be creative
and express yourself.

14:46.295 --> 14:47.921
But, outside of these walls,

14:48.503 --> 14:54.796
you will all take on the singular identity
of Karen Settman, named after your mother.

14:55.795 --> 15:00.129
- Can I play outside?
- Yes, you can, as long as it's your day.

15:00.212 --> 15:04.421
But you can never go outside together
at the same time, ever.

15:04.503 --> 15:06.296
Even with your bracelet.

15:06.378 --> 15:09.004
And, wherever you are
and whatever you're doing...

15:09.878 --> 15:12.171
you can never tell a soul
that you're a sibling.

15:12.253 --> 15:14.921
That's very important. You understand?

15:17.795 --> 15:21.629
Okay. Well, we begin tomorrow.

15:22.878 --> 15:24.629
Starting with you, Thursday.

15:38.128 --> 15:39.921
You ready to do this?

15:45.545 --> 15:46.546
Okay.

16:40.753 --> 16:43.590
<i>The following items may not be
taken through checkpoints</i>

16:43.670 --> 16:45.296
<i>without prior permission:</i>

16:45.378 --> 16:48.629
<i>any sharp objects, flammables, or chemicals.</i>

16:48.712 --> 16:50.671
<i>For your safety and security,</i>

16:50.753 --> 16:54.463
<i>have your bags ready for inspection
by an enforcement officer.</i>

16:55.212 --> 16:57.879
<i>Please have your wristbands
ready for inspection.</i>

16:58.462 --> 17:01.296
<i>No unauthorized persons
are allowed to enter the sector.</i>

17:19.502 --> 17:22.963
Don't forget, you're the one
and only Karen Settman.

17:41.920 --> 17:45.546
The end of the day meeting
is the most important part of your day.

17:45.628 --> 17:48.629
It's the time to share
every detail with your siblings.

17:50.503 --> 17:51.963
Okay?

18:05.337 --> 18:06.338
Mm...

18:22.670 --> 18:26.546
- Oh, God.
- Poor kid. Straight to the cryobank.

18:26.628 --> 18:29.754
With Cayman running for Parliament,
security's getting tighter.

18:29.837 --> 18:31.588
I fucking hate that bitch.

18:32.170 --> 18:35.629
I don't know.
Maybe cryosleep isn't such a bad idea.

18:36.587 --> 18:38.671
We turn ourselves in, get frozen,

18:39.128 --> 18:42.379
play <i>Sleeping Beauty</i>
until the population drops.

18:42.462 --> 18:45.713
I heard you still dream,
like, horrible nightmares

18:45.795 --> 18:46.963
for hundreds of years.

18:47.045 --> 18:50.838
By the time you wake up,
everyone you know and love will be gone.

18:50.920 --> 18:53.921
Well, we go to sleep together,
we wake up together.

18:54.795 --> 18:57.254
The Child Allocation Act
will be a thing of the past,

18:57.337 --> 18:58.715
and we can finally live our own lives.

18:58.795 --> 19:00.716
Are we really gonna have
this conversation again?

19:00.837 --> 19:03.171
Why can't you just accept
that this is your family?

19:03.253 --> 19:06.088
This isn't a family.
It's a repressive regime.

19:06.920 --> 19:08.796
I didn't pick this life
any more than you did.

19:08.878 --> 19:10.671
Yet you live it so perfectly.

19:10.753 --> 19:13.296
Karen Settman from cradle to grave.

19:13.378 --> 19:15.546
- It's disgusting.
- What do you care?

19:16.545 --> 19:19.129
Your only ambition was to be
a total loser, which you are.

19:19.212 --> 19:20.796
Fuck you, Monday.

19:21.587 --> 19:25.629
Just because I have my own personality and
dreams, and I want to have a relationship

19:25.712 --> 19:29.171
that is more than just a random fuck
with someone that I will never see again?

19:30.170 --> 19:33.796
I'm sick to death
of Miss Karen fucking Settman.

19:33.878 --> 19:36.879
Karen Settman is the foundation
we built our lives on.

19:36.962 --> 19:41.671
No, she's a mask,
a mask we put on one day a week.

19:42.253 --> 19:45.298
One day a week we can go out into the real
world, and we can't even be ourselves.

19:45.378 --> 19:48.254
- We have to be a fake person.
- Oh, shut up, both of you!

19:49.587 --> 19:54.296
- You're driving us all crazy.
- Yeah, this is our life. It is what it is.

19:55.378 --> 19:58.004
Being trapped in this prison
six days a week isn't a life.

19:58.753 --> 20:01.796
It's a slow, agonizing, soul-sucking death.

20:18.378 --> 20:19.713
Move over!

20:19.878 --> 20:23.213
Saturday, let's go.
Or you'll be late for your recital.

20:41.003 --> 20:43.754
So... you didn't see her leave...

20:45.170 --> 20:49.546
and you don't have any idea
where she might be.

20:52.503 --> 20:53.504
Well...

20:56.420 --> 20:58.463
When did you see her last?

21:42.003 --> 21:45.046
I was just skating and I fell! I did!

21:58.837 --> 22:00.921
Oh, Thursday...

22:04.837 --> 22:06.588
What if the Bureau caught you?

22:06.670 --> 22:10.254
One mistake is all it takes
to put all your lives at risk.

22:10.337 --> 22:13.254
I hate Karen Settman!
I wish I had never been born!

22:13.337 --> 22:14.338
Enough!

22:17.337 --> 22:18.671
You want to get taken away?

22:18.753 --> 22:21.421
Get frozen for all eternity
in that god-awful machine

22:21.503 --> 22:23.713
and never see me or your sisters again?

22:28.378 --> 22:29.379
Go.

22:30.420 --> 22:31.963
Monday.

22:35.128 --> 22:38.963
I warned you.
Everything you do affects each other.

22:46.253 --> 22:49.338
- What's that for?
- Keep still.

23:04.253 --> 23:05.879
What happens to one of you...

23:07.212 --> 23:08.879
happens to you all.

23:14.253 --> 23:15.379
Monday...

23:20.212 --> 23:21.629
I need you to be brave.

23:22.962 --> 23:24.671
Set an example for your sisters.

23:29.753 --> 23:31.088
Will it hurt?

23:35.128 --> 23:36.129
Yes.

23:39.170 --> 23:40.171
Don't move.

24:12.612 --> 24:14.779
I bet that rat tasted better going down.

24:16.528 --> 24:18.154
Shut up.

24:19.820 --> 24:22.821
You're burning up. You running a fever?

24:23.778 --> 24:24.779
No.

24:27.070 --> 24:29.113
- You sure?
- I'm fine.

24:33.820 --> 24:36.488
- Maybe you should switch days.
- I can do Monday.

24:38.487 --> 24:42.279
Success does not come
without sacrifice and struggle.

24:44.578 --> 24:46.454
Shut the fuck up.

25:28.812 --> 25:33.646
"Beneath the tall tree, while night
comes on gently, dark like me."

25:33.728 --> 25:35.104
Langston Hughes again, Eddie.

25:35.187 --> 25:38.354
- You sound like a broken record.
- And a good day to you, too.

25:45.020 --> 25:47.940
<i>The following items may not be
taken through checkpoints</i>

25:48.020 --> 25:49.479
<i>without prior permission:</i>

25:49.562 --> 25:52.979
<i>any sharp objects, flammables, or chemicals.</i>

25:53.062 --> 25:54.979
<i>For your safety and security...</i>

26:06.270 --> 26:09.354
<i>The following items may not
be taken through checkpoints</i>

26:09.437 --> 26:10.979
<i>without prior permission:</i>

26:11.062 --> 26:14.521
<i>any sharp objects, flammables, or chemicals.</i>

26:14.603 --> 26:17.521
<i>For your safety and security,
have your bags ready for inspection...</i>

26:17.603 --> 26:19.815
- Someone's in a rush, huh?
- <i>By an enforcement officer.</i>

26:19.895 --> 26:20.896
Big day at work.

26:22.478 --> 26:23.813
These lines are getting worse.

26:26.103 --> 26:28.898
Last week, a woman gave birth right here
because she couldn't get through.

26:28.978 --> 26:31.813
- No kidding.
- Of course, it had to happen on my day.

26:32.978 --> 26:35.521
Mondays are the worst.
I hate checkpoint duty.

26:36.145 --> 26:37.604
Except I get to see you.

26:41.895 --> 26:43.938
I'm afraid I have to ask you
a couple of questions.

26:44.020 --> 26:46.101
The Bureau's a stickler for protocol.
You understand.

26:47.187 --> 26:49.688
- What's your name?
- Karen Settman.

26:49.770 --> 26:52.688
- Karen, do you have any siblings?
- No.

26:52.770 --> 26:55.188
You carrying any contraband?

26:55.770 --> 26:57.021
No.

26:57.403 --> 26:58.604
Are you sure?

26:59.878 --> 27:01.479
Do I have to body search you?

27:07.437 --> 27:08.479
You may proceed.

27:45.062 --> 27:47.313
- Karen.
- Jerry.

27:54.228 --> 27:55.229
So...

27:56.270 --> 27:59.813
Today's the big day, huh?
We'll see who gets the promotion.

28:01.603 --> 28:03.979
All these years, I've been trying
to figure out your angle.

28:05.687 --> 28:09.813
I always thought, with a body like that,
you'd fuck your way to the top.

28:12.103 --> 28:14.229
But then it turns out, you're a frigid bitch.

28:17.478 --> 28:20.146
Just because I find you repulsive?

28:24.520 --> 28:25.896
You're not interested in anyone.

28:29.103 --> 28:33.354
Working here, night after night,
like a fucking robot.

28:36.312 --> 28:38.271
You think you have us all fooled, don't you?

28:38.353 --> 28:41.646
I have no idea what you're talking about.

28:42.603 --> 28:43.646
Yes, you do.

28:47.937 --> 28:48.938
Karen.

28:51.187 --> 28:52.188
I'm onto you.

29:26.145 --> 29:27.354
Where the hell is she?

29:30.478 --> 29:33.896
- Did you try her again?
- Yeah. Straight to voicemail.

29:34.478 --> 29:36.604
- Maybe she got held up.
- She would have called.

29:38.478 --> 29:39.479
Ping her bracelet.

29:48.812 --> 29:51.271
- That's weird.
- What?

29:51.353 --> 29:52.688
Her GPS locator is off.

29:54.437 --> 29:56.229
She's not showing up on the grid.

29:57.687 --> 30:02.313
- She can't just vanish.
- Oh, yes, you can... if you want to.

30:02.395 --> 30:04.104
Maybe she was in an accident.

30:04.187 --> 30:07.313
Run a search. Um, hospitals, police records.

30:08.937 --> 30:11.354
What if Monday's hurt? Or dead?

30:12.270 --> 30:15.688
And the authorities find her before we do?

30:16.978 --> 30:20.729
Then... Karen Settman no longer exists.

30:21.770 --> 30:23.563
And our lives are over.

30:23.645 --> 30:26.063
Jeez, she's only a few minutes late.

30:27.853 --> 30:30.563
Monday's never been late
for an end of day meeting.

30:36.562 --> 30:37.563
Ever.

31:15.145 --> 31:19.604
"Eyes bloodshot from excessive drug use
and emotional distress.

31:21.353 --> 31:23.729
<i>Dark circles under the eyes..."</i>

31:52.145 --> 31:53.271
- Ow!
- Stay still.

31:58.187 --> 32:00.396
Really? Pot brownie?

32:01.103 --> 32:04.646
It's medicinal.
You know it's good for my nerves.

32:08.145 --> 32:10.104
I have a bad feeling about this.

32:10.687 --> 32:13.288
Remember what happened last time
two of us were out there at once.

32:15.353 --> 32:16.354
That was bad.

32:18.728 --> 32:22.604
We gotta figure out where Monday is.
You gotta act as if everything is normal.

32:23.187 --> 32:28.188
Easy for you to say. It's not your day.
What if we've been listed?

32:29.478 --> 32:31.938
Listen to me. If Karen Settman's been listed,

32:32.020 --> 32:34.901
the Bureau would've kicked in the door,
and we'd all be processed by now.

32:35.895 --> 32:36.896
Well...

32:38.312 --> 32:40.896
technically speaking,
one of us would get to live.

32:53.437 --> 32:56.063
- Good morning, Miss Settman.
- Good morning, Eddie.

32:57.020 --> 32:58.938
I didn't see you come home yesterday.

33:02.003 --> 33:05.521
After hours. Let myself in.

33:29.645 --> 33:33.146
<i>may not be taken through checkpoints

33:33.228 --> 33:36.438
<i>any sharp objects, flammables, or chemicals.</i>

33:36.520 --> 33:38.313
<i>For your safety and security,</i>

33:38.395 --> 33:41.896
<i>have your bag ready for inspection
by an enforcement officer.</i>

33:44.145 --> 33:45.146
She's through.

34:10.145 --> 34:11.853
So, we got our promotion.

34:11.937 --> 34:13.478
Stay focused, Tuesday.

34:13.562 --> 34:17.063
Check the calendar, desktop,
anything that might give us a clue.

34:20.020 --> 34:22.978
I've got the brief for your conference call.

34:23.062 --> 34:25.396
Vicky, when was the last time
you synched my tablet?

34:25.478 --> 34:28.646
9:03 this morning. Why?

34:29.353 --> 34:31.853
Um, I forgot to log out last night.

34:32.562 --> 34:34.396
You left early to celebrate.

34:35.553 --> 34:37.429
Yes, of course.

34:37.687 --> 34:38.688
Um...

34:41.003 --> 34:43.148
Where did I go again?

34:43.228 --> 34:46.353
Your favorite bar. Harry's.

34:47.237 --> 34:50.188
Yes, of course. Harry's. Thanks.

34:50.270 --> 34:51.271
You're welcome.

35:34.453 --> 35:36.546
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

35:42.978 --> 35:45.521
Last night, um... do you remember what...

35:45.603 --> 35:46.854
what time I left?

35:47.437 --> 35:50.396
You only stayed for one drink.
You barely touched it.

35:50.478 --> 35:52.479
I think that colleague of yours put you off.

35:53.270 --> 35:54.271
Yeah.

35:55.145 --> 35:57.438
God, yeah. Which one of them?

35:58.770 --> 36:01.146
You know, that douchebag in the suspenders.

36:02.145 --> 36:05.021
- Jerry, I think?
- Yeah.

36:07.812 --> 36:10.438
Monday and Jerry argued
just before she left the bar.

36:12.120 --> 36:13.646
He's onto us.

36:14.603 --> 36:17.146
- I knew it.
- Fucking dick sold us out.

36:17.228 --> 36:20.688
Then why aren't we listed?
You've got to corner him, Tuesday.

36:20.770 --> 36:24.438
- Find out what he knows.
- Are you nuts?

36:24.520 --> 36:26.979
He could be the last person who saw Monday.

36:28.145 --> 36:30.771
- <i>He's our only lead.</i>
- Yeah, okay.

36:41.062 --> 36:42.063
Miss Settman.

36:44.937 --> 36:45.938
Yes?

36:46.437 --> 36:48.313
Step into the van, please.

36:49.520 --> 36:50.521
Is there a problem?

36:51.853 --> 36:53.813
I don't understand. Who are you?

37:03.270 --> 37:04.396
Step into the fucking van.

37:19.395 --> 37:20.563
Wha...?

37:20.645 --> 37:23.604
That's weird. I lost her.

37:49.478 --> 37:50.854
There's obviously been a mistake.

37:51.562 --> 37:53.479
Can you please tell me what I'm doing here?

38:21.395 --> 38:22.396
Miss Settman.

38:26.228 --> 38:28.479
What a pleasure to meet you.

38:43.478 --> 38:44.979
Nicolette Cayman.

38:48.437 --> 38:50.521
I know who you are. Uh...

38:54.853 --> 38:57.146
Can you please tell me why I'm here?

39:00.395 --> 39:01.646
You poor child.

39:04.312 --> 39:07.271
I am amazed you made it this far.

39:09.562 --> 39:12.896
This is... This is all a big mistake.

39:13.478 --> 39:15.063
Seven children.

39:17.020 --> 39:18.854
What was your grandfather thinking?

39:20.645 --> 39:23.604
Do you have any idea how much food and water

39:23.687 --> 39:26.813
was taken out of others' mouths
so you could be here today?

39:26.895 --> 39:31.813
If everyone were as cruel and selfish
as Terrence Settman,

39:31.895 --> 39:33.438
the world would end tomorrow.

39:38.728 --> 39:40.771
I am an only child.

39:43.478 --> 39:45.396
For your sake, I wish that were true.

39:47.312 --> 39:48.433
There are five of them left.

39:50.770 --> 39:52.979
All the rotten eggs in one basket.

39:55.312 --> 39:57.813
- Is there another way?
- Not if you want to keep it quiet.

40:03.187 --> 40:05.146
What are you doing? Um...

40:07.687 --> 40:10.854
I-I work in a bank!
I can get you money! Please! Please!

40:10.937 --> 40:12.896
We can make some kind of deal! Please!

40:14.353 --> 40:15.354
Funny.

40:17.895 --> 40:19.604
That's what the last one said.

40:24.978 --> 40:29.979
No, wait! No! No, please, no! No, no, no, no!

41:05.270 --> 41:07.188
I can't believe this is happening.

41:08.770 --> 41:10.354
We can't just sit here.

41:11.395 --> 41:14.438
We gotta help her. We gotta...
We gotta go out there.

41:17.812 --> 41:19.604
We gotta do something!

41:26.045 --> 41:27.229
Thursday...

41:41.812 --> 41:42.813
Oh, my God.

41:45.187 --> 41:46.479
What the...

41:56.228 --> 41:58.021
Residents or visitors?

42:00.812 --> 42:01.813
Visitors.

43:28.927 --> 43:30.094
Step out.

43:30.760 --> 43:31.803
All of you.

43:34.218 --> 43:35.303
Now!

43:42.885 --> 43:43.886
That's it.

43:44.677 --> 43:46.094
Nice and slow.

43:46.843 --> 43:48.511
Nice and slow.

43:51.135 --> 43:52.553
This way.

44:11.010 --> 44:12.011
Look at them.

44:12.968 --> 44:14.261
Hiding like rats.

44:23.843 --> 44:24.844
So...

44:27.260 --> 44:28.303
Where's the last one?

44:30.843 --> 44:31.844
Fuck you.

45:26.093 --> 45:27.844
You fucking cunt!

45:56.968 --> 45:58.344
Fucking cu...

47:39.468 --> 47:40.469
Is it bad?

47:42.552 --> 47:44.428
It's okay. Look at me.

47:51.843 --> 47:55.678
I don't want to die. I don't want to die.

47:56.260 --> 47:59.761
You're gonna be okay. I'm here. It's okay.

48:07.968 --> 48:08.969
I'm sorry.

48:10.718 --> 48:12.136
I'm so sorry.

48:13.343 --> 48:15.553
No. You're Sunday.

48:18.343 --> 48:20.053
You're supposed to be the believer.

48:30.802 --> 48:32.678
I don't know what I believe.

48:36.093 --> 48:37.511
I don't...

48:42.927 --> 48:44.303
I don't know who I am.

49:11.552 --> 49:13.053
No!

49:16.760 --> 49:19.594
No! No!

49:22.677 --> 49:24.178
No!

49:32.843 --> 49:34.553
Goddamn it!

50:04.468 --> 50:05.553
They won't suffer.

50:06.968 --> 50:08.886
- Excuse me?
- I'm assured of that.

50:11.343 --> 50:12.344
Um...

50:13.510 --> 50:15.053
We may have a containment problem.

50:15.635 --> 50:18.303
We still haven't heard back
from the Settman team.

50:23.635 --> 50:28.844
Last night, I dreamed this whole building
erupted and spewed out all the siblings.

50:31.052 --> 50:32.469
There were so many of them.

50:33.677 --> 50:35.719
A sea of little bodies...

50:37.635 --> 50:39.261
scorched by flames.

50:40.260 --> 50:42.219
I know what you feel for these children.

50:43.552 --> 50:46.553
But this is on their parents, not you.

50:47.260 --> 50:49.094
Sometimes, I think, "To hell with it."

50:50.760 --> 50:52.053
To hell with everybody.

50:53.802 --> 50:55.594
Humans will never learn.

50:56.177 --> 50:58.678
You're our last chance, Dr. Cayman.

51:00.843 --> 51:02.303
Our only hope.

51:06.302 --> 51:09.053
I need you, Joe. Be careful.

51:10.802 --> 51:13.844
Do not underestimate the Settmans.

51:14.677 --> 51:17.430
If we officially list them,
they'll be flagged at the first checkpoint

51:17.510 --> 51:18.928
and processed within hours.

51:19.010 --> 51:23.969
Seven siblings surviving to adulthood?
It would destroy my credibility. No.

51:24.843 --> 51:26.594
We have to keep this localized.

51:27.177 --> 51:29.553
They are trapped inside that apartment
and they know it.

51:30.677 --> 51:33.886
Besides... we have another issue.

51:35.593 --> 51:36.886
A complication.

51:37.718 --> 51:39.344
Make that a priority.

51:40.093 --> 51:43.303
Then deal with the Settmans.

52:18.677 --> 52:20.353
It's Tuesday's.

52:21.537 --> 52:22.594
No...

52:49.102 --> 52:51.136
What the fuck are we doing? Huh?

52:51.218 --> 52:53.094
We gotta get out of here now.

52:54.010 --> 52:56.719
They know about us.
They're gonna send more people.

52:56.802 --> 52:59.886
Let them come. I'll fucking kill them all.

52:59.968 --> 53:01.386
Calm down.

53:02.010 --> 53:03.719
Just think for a second.

53:05.218 --> 53:07.636
Four of us out there at once?
With all the Bureau agents

53:07.718 --> 53:09.094
and checkpoints and sensors?

53:09.577 --> 53:11.553
We won't last for two minutes.

53:11.635 --> 53:16.303
We always work best as a team...
in an environment we can control.

53:16.385 --> 53:18.053
Those guys, they weren't Bureau.

53:18.968 --> 53:22.386
Or we'd be listed by now, and this place
would be crawling with agents.

53:22.468 --> 53:24.886
Somebody wants us to disappear.

53:34.343 --> 53:36.261
The question is why.

53:50.293 --> 53:51.386
Fuck it.

53:54.010 --> 53:56.928
Every Wednesday,
I wear a stupid dress and high heels.

53:57.010 --> 53:58.428
Not today.

54:00.843 --> 54:03.344
- What's that?
- Something I wish I thought of yesterday.

54:03.427 --> 54:06.803
I customized it,
so we'll see and hear everything you do.

54:08.927 --> 54:10.511
It's a user-locked grip.

54:12.368 --> 54:14.844
- Can you unlock it?
- If I had more time.

54:16.010 --> 54:17.428
For now, it's not gonna fire.

54:17.510 --> 54:22.219
- Doesn't make it any less intimidating.
- This isn't a game, Wednesday.

54:22.302 --> 54:26.511
Go to Jerry's. Find out what he knows.
Don't lose your head out there.

54:29.677 --> 54:30.678
I won't.

54:31.552 --> 54:36.178
<i>Cryosleep. Awake to a better world.</i>

54:58.760 --> 55:03.011
Hello, Karen.
You're cutting it close. Aren't you?

55:08.760 --> 55:09.761
Please.

55:12.177 --> 55:13.469
Rough night?

55:19.718 --> 55:21.594
<i>Well, I did say you had until this morning,</i>

55:21.677 --> 55:24.886
<i>and it's still morning, I guess,
technically, so...</i>

55:33.177 --> 55:34.219
What's it gonna be?

55:38.843 --> 55:40.678
What's what gonna be?

55:41.718 --> 55:43.928
Do we have a deal or not?

55:45.510 --> 55:46.511
Deal...

55:47.760 --> 55:49.178
What deal?

55:49.260 --> 55:51.469
Playing dumb doesn't suit ya, Settman.

55:53.052 --> 55:54.053
This is very simple.

55:55.302 --> 55:57.053
You pass on the promotion.

55:57.635 --> 55:58.678
It goes to me.

55:59.343 --> 56:02.303
And I keep my mouth shut
about your little secret.

56:08.343 --> 56:09.678
You motherfucker!

56:18.760 --> 56:20.344
How long have you known?

56:24.843 --> 56:28.803
You should be glad it was me
who found that contract,

56:29.510 --> 56:31.344
or you'd be in jail by now.

56:33.177 --> 56:34.678
<i>What contract?</i>

56:36.135 --> 56:38.428
- Are you serious?
- What fucking contract?

56:38.510 --> 56:41.469
407-C funds transfer.

56:43.093 --> 56:44.761
Your contract with Cayman.

56:46.510 --> 56:47.553
Cayman.

56:51.427 --> 56:52.928
Nicolette Cayman.

56:54.177 --> 56:57.386
Yeah. Your new VIP client.

56:58.802 --> 57:00.178
Do you guys know about this?

57:19.177 --> 57:20.011
Wow.

57:21.010 --> 57:24.344
This, um... This contract, wh... where is it?

57:24.427 --> 57:26.094
On my tablet.

57:26.677 --> 57:27.678
Show it to me.

57:30.718 --> 57:31.719
Yeah.

57:40.177 --> 57:41.178
Get out of there!

58:02.968 --> 58:04.678
Lost sight of the target.

58:07.593 --> 58:09.854
Going in. Hold position.

58:33.302 --> 58:35.053
Guys? You there?

58:36.718 --> 58:38.553
Which way? Where do I go?

58:43.885 --> 58:45.386
Best option is front door.

58:49.843 --> 58:52.261
- Spread out.
- That's not an option.

01:00:21.552 --> 01:00:22.678
Oh, shit.

01:00:27.427 --> 01:00:28.428
Erickson?

01:00:31.010 --> 01:00:32.011
Erickson, copy.

01:00:32.593 --> 01:00:33.594
<i>Erickson.</i>

01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:01.966
<i>Sir?</i>

01:02:02.548 --> 01:02:03.549
Sir, do you copy?

01:02:04.382 --> 01:02:06.424
What's going on up there? Do you need backup?

01:02:18.215 --> 01:02:19.674
Guess so.

01:02:20.257 --> 01:02:23.091
Move it! Take the sibling down.

01:02:31.173 --> 01:02:33.633
Girls? I need a way out, now.

01:02:37.257 --> 01:02:40.424
There, a dumpster, below the bedroom window.

01:02:41.132 --> 01:02:43.758
- Come on.
- <i>It's a three-story drop,</i>

01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:45.302
but the trash will soften the impact.

01:02:48.007 --> 01:02:49.216
You better be right, sis.

01:03:05.965 --> 01:03:06.966
Fuck!

01:03:08.257 --> 01:03:09.341
It's empty.

01:03:09.423 --> 01:03:14.091
The trash collection
is every Wednesday morning. Sorry.

01:03:15.757 --> 01:03:16.924
Are you okay?

01:03:17.007 --> 01:03:19.633
- <i>Can you run?</i>
- I think so.

01:03:22.298 --> 01:03:23.299
Then run.

01:03:38.382 --> 01:03:39.799
Go, go, go!

01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:42.258
Guys, where am I going?

01:03:43.590 --> 01:03:46.258
Next left. There's a door
at the end of the alley.

01:04:52.548 --> 01:04:53.549
Come on.

01:04:55.840 --> 01:04:57.924
What are you waiting for? Go get her!

01:05:05.590 --> 01:05:06.841
Everybody move!

01:05:18.423 --> 01:05:19.424
Move!

01:05:21.215 --> 01:05:22.466
Get out of the fucking way!

01:05:22.548 --> 01:05:24.258
- Get out of the way!
- Move!

01:05:47.423 --> 01:05:48.549
<i>What do I do?</i>

01:05:48.632 --> 01:05:52.216
We need to get you on the roof.
I can get you home from there.

01:05:52.298 --> 01:05:53.299
Hold tight.

01:06:03.798 --> 01:06:05.758
- Oh, shit.
- It's the Bureau.

01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:08.424
- I thought you said we're not listed.
- We're not.

01:06:08.507 --> 01:06:12.299
- Then what the fuck is he doing here?
- Friday? Friday!

01:06:18.173 --> 01:06:20.258
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Wait!

01:06:22.048 --> 01:06:24.049
- What are you gonna do?
- Find out what he wants.

01:06:25.882 --> 01:06:26.883
And get rid of him.

01:06:31.382 --> 01:06:32.383
I got this.

01:06:36.173 --> 01:06:38.008
Hey, open up!

01:06:48.423 --> 01:06:50.216
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:06:52.798 --> 01:06:53.799
New look?

01:06:57.132 --> 01:06:58.258
Y-Yeah.

01:06:59.173 --> 01:07:02.716
Yeah, I wanted to, um... try something new.

01:07:02.798 --> 01:07:04.383
Nice.

01:07:06.965 --> 01:07:10.466
Um, I called your... your office.
They said you were out sick.

01:07:11.382 --> 01:07:12.927
I know. I know I'm not supposed to call,

01:07:13.007 --> 01:07:16.924
- but when I saw you at the Bureau, I was...
- The... The Bureau?

01:07:19.465 --> 01:07:20.466
Yeah.

01:07:21.465 --> 01:07:23.299
Yeah, yeah, I had to go and, um...

01:07:25.382 --> 01:07:26.508
drop off some stuff.

01:07:28.548 --> 01:07:29.924
Boring bank stuff.

01:07:34.757 --> 01:07:36.424
Aren't you going to invite me in?

01:07:37.340 --> 01:07:39.633
I was only joking about the forced entry.

01:07:45.090 --> 01:07:46.091
<i>Friday?</i>

01:07:47.465 --> 01:07:49.508
Hold on. We've got a situation.

01:07:49.590 --> 01:07:50.966
You've got a situation?

01:07:58.590 --> 01:07:59.591
It's a nice place.

01:08:00.298 --> 01:08:02.883
Friday? You there?

01:08:42.423 --> 01:08:44.258
Who the fuck is this guy?

01:08:55.048 --> 01:08:56.091
Please don't do that.

01:08:57.381 --> 01:08:58.383
What?

01:08:59.923 --> 01:09:02.008
Are you... Are you serious?

01:09:03.298 --> 01:09:05.549
Sorry, I thought you liked that stuff. I'm...

01:09:07.215 --> 01:09:08.216
Just, um...

01:09:09.381 --> 01:09:12.424
Just... give me a sec.

01:09:13.006 --> 01:09:15.258
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

01:09:34.006 --> 01:09:37.049
- What the hell is going on?
- You tell me. Who is that guy?

01:09:37.131 --> 01:09:38.966
Don't bullshit me. Have you been seeing him?

01:09:39.048 --> 01:09:40.383
What? No.

01:09:40.465 --> 01:09:43.008
He's a Bureau agent.
Do you think I'm fucking stupid?

01:09:43.090 --> 01:09:46.466
- You two seemed very familiar.
- It's called acting.

01:09:46.548 --> 01:09:49.466
How do I know you're not acting now
and you've been seeing him all along?

01:09:50.881 --> 01:09:54.258
I've never seen him in my life,
I swear to God.

01:09:59.673 --> 01:10:02.299
You need to... to get him
to take you to his place

01:10:02.382 --> 01:10:04.549
and find out which one of us
he's been seeing.

01:10:04.632 --> 01:10:07.549
- What?
- Yeah, find out what he knows.

01:10:07.632 --> 01:10:10.383
Have you lost it completely?
You want me to go with him?

01:10:11.548 --> 01:10:14.174
- Yeah.
- I think he wants to fuck me.

01:10:14.257 --> 01:10:15.924
Well, no shit.

01:10:21.132 --> 01:10:23.258
- Show me your bracelet.
- Why?

01:10:23.340 --> 01:10:26.133
It's a coupling device
from the dead guy's bracelet.

01:10:26.923 --> 01:10:29.049
All you need to do is get yours close to his.

01:10:30.590 --> 01:10:32.133
Wait. What?

01:10:32.715 --> 01:10:36.383
Just activate your bracelet
and connect it to that guy's,

01:10:36.465 --> 01:10:38.674
and we get a gateway
into the Bureau's servers.

01:10:46.798 --> 01:10:48.258
What if he catches me?

01:10:48.340 --> 01:10:51.633
Well, I'm sure you know
a few tricks to distract him.

01:10:52.340 --> 01:10:54.799
Well, I don't know any tricks.

01:10:56.673 --> 01:10:58.174
What do you mean?

01:11:04.798 --> 01:11:06.091
All your big talk...

01:11:08.173 --> 01:11:09.883
You've never been with anyone?

01:11:14.298 --> 01:11:15.341
I'll be right there!

01:11:39.423 --> 01:11:41.091
Oh, God! Wednesday!

01:11:42.132 --> 01:11:43.133
Oh, shit!

01:11:49.798 --> 01:11:52.049
- We're back.
- <i>About time.</i>

01:11:52.582 --> 01:11:54.624
There's, uh, roof access.

01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:56.758
The last door, southwest corner.

01:12:22.548 --> 01:12:23.549
Guys...

01:12:24.673 --> 01:12:26.549
There is no way I can clear this.

01:12:27.132 --> 01:12:28.966
There's only two ways out of this, Wednesday.

01:12:29.048 --> 01:12:32.591
You make that jump or you catch a bullet.
At least, this way, you stand a chance.

01:12:47.965 --> 01:12:49.799
You've been training for this
your whole life.

01:12:50.507 --> 01:12:51.508
You can do it.

01:12:52.548 --> 01:12:53.549
Move! Move!

01:12:56.165 --> 01:12:57.966
You can make that jump.

01:14:09.798 --> 01:14:11.320
Get her to the processing center.

01:14:12.090 --> 01:14:13.924
They'll know what to do.

01:14:15.007 --> 01:14:16.008
I'll call it in.

01:14:24.357 --> 01:14:26.108
What do you want to drink?

01:14:27.423 --> 01:14:29.466
- A shot of vodka.
- Oh.

01:15:51.007 --> 01:15:52.216
The file from Wednesday.

01:15:52.298 --> 01:15:56.383
It's a 407-C funds transfer,
just like Jerry said.

01:16:01.090 --> 01:16:02.591
Why would Karen Settman

01:16:02.673 --> 01:16:07.883
illegally transfer millions of euros
into Nicolette Cayman's campaign fund?

01:16:11.090 --> 01:16:15.049
This contract was executed the same day
as we got our promotion.

01:16:18.965 --> 01:16:20.383
A transfer that big...

01:16:21.298 --> 01:16:22.299
Hm...

01:16:25.507 --> 01:16:29.049
Karen Settman really needed that promotion.

01:16:33.215 --> 01:16:34.258
That's weird.

01:16:36.090 --> 01:16:37.841
There's no signature.

01:18:00.632 --> 01:18:01.799
We're in.

01:18:03.423 --> 01:18:05.633
- She did it.
- Yeah.

01:18:29.007 --> 01:18:30.008
Fuck me.

01:19:07.798 --> 01:19:09.258
Wh-Where are the cells?

01:19:10.173 --> 01:19:12.174
You know, where they keep people.

01:19:13.090 --> 01:19:14.091
Oh, uh...

01:19:14.173 --> 01:19:16.883
- The processing center.
- Can you get in there?

01:19:17.548 --> 01:19:20.216
I think so. Hold on.

01:19:43.757 --> 01:19:44.758
Stop.

01:19:50.923 --> 01:19:53.424
- Is this feed real time?
- Yeah.

01:20:05.507 --> 01:20:07.591
I-I think it's Monday.

01:20:35.090 --> 01:20:36.341
Oh, shit.

01:20:38.090 --> 01:20:39.091
I'm late.

01:20:39.798 --> 01:20:41.224
Don't go.

01:20:43.007 --> 01:20:44.633
I gotta go.

01:20:50.340 --> 01:20:52.466
There's this big event at the Bureau tonight.

01:20:53.340 --> 01:20:55.022
Cayman's starting her push for Parliament.

01:21:02.257 --> 01:21:03.633
Why are you working for them?

01:21:05.007 --> 01:21:07.674
The Bureau? Why not?

01:21:09.590 --> 01:21:11.383
Well, couldn't you get another job?

01:21:12.090 --> 01:21:13.716
Why would I want another job?

01:21:13.798 --> 01:21:17.216
Don't you think it's wrong
to be rounding up siblings?

01:21:17.298 --> 01:21:19.674
Have you ever set foot in the lower sectors?

01:21:20.465 --> 01:21:24.841
I mean, most of these kids that we pick up,
they live in really shitty conditions.

01:21:25.823 --> 01:21:27.841
Trust me, we're doing them a favor.

01:21:27.923 --> 01:21:30.008
By sending them off to the cryobank?

01:21:33.090 --> 01:21:35.383
Yeah. For now.

01:21:35.965 --> 01:21:37.258
Until we see better days.

01:21:44.132 --> 01:21:45.133
See you later?

01:21:48.215 --> 01:21:51.758
I have some... work stuff to catch up on.

01:21:56.840 --> 01:21:59.799
- Let's meet on our usual day.
- We talked about this, right?

01:22:01.715 --> 01:22:03.424
I just wanna be with you every day.

01:22:05.298 --> 01:22:06.758
Not just Monday.

01:22:10.340 --> 01:22:11.341
See you, babe.

01:22:32.840 --> 01:22:35.299
<i>So, Monday's been seeing Adrian for months.</i>

01:22:35.382 --> 01:22:38.008
Miss Perfect likes to be choked during sex.

01:22:38.090 --> 01:22:39.466
<i>Can you believe it?</i>

01:22:40.465 --> 01:22:41.966
Cayman is holding her hostage.

01:22:42.548 --> 01:22:45.299
What? Monday's alive?

01:22:45.382 --> 01:22:46.466
Yeah.

01:22:46.548 --> 01:22:50.424
Be careful, Saturday.
This Bureau agent could be playing us.

01:22:55.007 --> 01:22:57.508
I... I don't know.

01:23:02.298 --> 01:23:05.674
<i>I don't think so. I'm scared, Thursday.</i>

01:23:06.673 --> 01:23:09.258
- What are we gonna do?
- We're gonna get through this.

01:23:10.298 --> 01:23:12.549
Every day we set foot outside,
we beat the odds.

01:23:14.007 --> 01:23:17.799
We're gonna get Monday out, and we're gonna
show the world who Cayman really is.

01:24:03.590 --> 01:24:04.591
<i>I love...</i>

01:24:35.673 --> 01:24:38.758
- We gotta go!
- No! It's everything.

01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:41.508
- Our whole life is in here.
- There's no time.

01:24:41.590 --> 01:24:43.841
This is the only proof we ever existed.

01:24:43.923 --> 01:24:47.508
Come on. Forget it. We gotta go. Okay?

01:24:49.548 --> 01:24:50.383
Okay.

01:24:53.423 --> 01:24:54.841
Here, put it over your face.

01:25:00.382 --> 01:25:01.383
Come on!

01:25:09.590 --> 01:25:11.191
Come on!

01:25:25.215 --> 01:25:26.716
Come on, Friday.

01:25:37.965 --> 01:25:40.049
Friday, what are you doing?

01:25:42.673 --> 01:25:43.716
Friday!

01:25:46.715 --> 01:25:48.091
Friday, what the fuck?

01:25:53.090 --> 01:25:55.299
Friday, get down here now! Please!

01:26:00.215 --> 01:26:01.591
Friday!

01:26:41.632 --> 01:26:43.174
Friday, get down, please.

01:26:45.715 --> 01:26:48.091
I synched everything to your bracelet.

01:26:48.173 --> 01:26:49.091
What?

01:26:49.873 --> 01:26:51.133
Go and get Monday.

01:26:51.215 --> 01:26:54.966
<i>Show Cayman who Karen Settman really is.</i>

01:26:55.048 --> 01:26:57.258
What are you talking about?
Please, there's still time!

01:27:00.757 --> 01:27:04.299
It's okay. I'm not like the rest of you.

01:27:07.382 --> 01:27:09.633
As crazy and dysfunctional as our family was,

01:27:09.715 --> 01:27:11.466
<i>I needed it to survive.</i>

01:27:12.048 --> 01:27:13.466
I couldn't make it out there.

01:27:14.548 --> 01:27:15.716
Not without you guys.

01:27:15.798 --> 01:27:18.133
Friday, get down here now! Please!

01:27:25.423 --> 01:27:26.758
Friday!

01:27:27.340 --> 01:27:28.841
It's time to unplug, big sis.

01:27:42.090 --> 01:27:43.216
I love you.

01:28:52.590 --> 01:28:54.468
<i>Zulu Victor One to Bravo Delta.</i>

01:28:54.548 --> 01:28:56.341
<i>Zulu Victor One to Bravo Delta.</i>

01:28:56.423 --> 01:29:00.924
<i>Reports of an explosion.
25 Alexander Plaza. Multiple causalities.</i>

01:29:01.007 --> 01:29:04.841
<i>I repeat, 25 Alexander Plaza.
Multiple casualties. Please respond.</i>

01:29:35.257 --> 01:29:36.758
Move! Move!

01:29:40.740 --> 01:29:42.299
Another one coming your way.

01:29:42.382 --> 01:29:44.591
- <i>Authorization?</i>
- Full clearance.

01:29:45.507 --> 01:29:46.883
- You know the drill.
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

01:29:56.840 --> 01:29:57.674
Karen?

01:29:57.757 --> 01:29:59.427
- Step back, please.
- Get him out of here.

01:29:59.507 --> 01:30:02.674
Is it Karen? Let me see her.
Let me see her! Let me see her!

01:30:02.757 --> 01:30:05.133
Let me see her! Karen!

01:30:06.007 --> 01:30:07.008
Ka...

01:30:27.132 --> 01:30:28.424
Don't move!

01:30:30.840 --> 01:30:31.841
Don't move!

01:30:33.757 --> 01:30:34.758
What the fuck?

01:30:36.007 --> 01:30:37.591
You sold us out.

01:30:39.382 --> 01:30:40.841
You son of a bitch!

01:30:42.507 --> 01:30:43.508
Karen?

01:30:45.090 --> 01:30:46.633
K-Karen?

01:30:46.715 --> 01:30:49.174
Who are you? Who are you?

01:30:49.257 --> 01:30:53.508
Stop your fucking games! You know who I am.

01:30:59.382 --> 01:31:01.258
Jesus Christ, you're a sibling.

01:31:03.757 --> 01:31:04.758
Yeah.

01:31:06.007 --> 01:31:07.091
One of seven.

01:31:08.298 --> 01:31:10.299
Identical in every way.

01:31:13.465 --> 01:31:14.466
Well...

01:31:16.215 --> 01:31:17.341
not in every way.

01:31:18.548 --> 01:31:19.549
Karen...

01:31:20.757 --> 01:31:22.258
I saw her in a body bag.

01:31:22.340 --> 01:31:24.633
- Not her.
- She was in my apartment last night.

01:31:24.715 --> 01:31:26.883
- She was in my apartment. I saw her.
- Not her.

01:31:26.965 --> 01:31:29.633
- She was in my apartment!
- It wasn't her! She's not dead.

01:31:31.882 --> 01:31:32.883
She's alive.

01:31:47.257 --> 01:31:48.258
<i>I love...</i>

01:31:55.507 --> 01:31:59.299
I have nothing to do with it.
You have to trust me. I love Karen.

01:32:11.257 --> 01:32:12.966
Cayman is holding her hostage.

01:32:14.548 --> 01:32:15.549
If you love her...

01:32:17.215 --> 01:32:18.508
if you really love her...

01:32:19.673 --> 01:32:21.091
you gotta help me.

01:32:27.840 --> 01:32:28.841
You have a plan?

01:32:32.632 --> 01:32:33.716
I am the plan.

01:32:54.548 --> 01:32:56.109
Yeah, they're expecting you downstairs.

01:33:53.298 --> 01:33:54.466
I'll take it from here.

01:34:31.173 --> 01:34:32.174
Will it hurt?

01:34:34.048 --> 01:34:35.049
No.

01:36:07.298 --> 01:36:08.591
I thought there was a fire.

01:36:15.257 --> 01:36:16.258
Fuck.

01:36:23.882 --> 01:36:24.883
No, no! No! No!

01:36:32.298 --> 01:36:34.591
No! No, no! No!

01:36:34.673 --> 01:36:39.466
Help me! Let me out!
Help me! Please let me out!

01:36:54.592 --> 01:36:55.843
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:37:20.925 --> 01:37:22.843
It was all a lie.

01:37:26.175 --> 01:37:27.718
Cayman killed them all.

01:37:33.675 --> 01:37:34.926
Every sibling.

01:38:18.092 --> 01:38:19.093
Okay.

01:38:38.802 --> 01:38:40.334
Hey.

01:38:43.342 --> 01:38:44.343
Karen.

01:38:44.425 --> 01:38:45.634
Tuesday.

01:38:46.425 --> 01:38:48.509
- No, please! Please, no, please!
- It's me. It's me.

01:38:48.592 --> 01:38:50.676
- Please, no, please!
- It's not her.

01:39:00.800 --> 01:39:02.426
It's okay.

01:39:06.300 --> 01:39:08.593
We're gonna get you out. Okay?

01:39:08.675 --> 01:39:11.884
Where's Karen?
Is she still alive? Where's Karen?

01:39:14.425 --> 01:39:15.634
What happened to Monday?

01:39:21.758 --> 01:39:22.759
Ah...

01:39:24.050 --> 01:39:25.051
Karen.

01:39:25.550 --> 01:39:29.843
How are you enjoying your stay?
I trust we've made you comfortable.

01:39:31.217 --> 01:39:32.259
More than comfortable.

01:39:33.883 --> 01:39:37.259
We failed miserably
as a species on this planet.

01:39:37.842 --> 01:39:39.884
Masterminding our own extinction.

01:39:41.258 --> 01:39:46.134
But, through it all, through your donation
and my push for Parliament,

01:39:46.217 --> 01:39:49.718
we might just still have another chance.

01:39:59.092 --> 01:40:00.093
Take your wig off.

01:40:04.175 --> 01:40:05.176
Take it off!

01:40:10.217 --> 01:40:12.718
If you're beginning to have second thoughts,

01:40:12.800 --> 01:40:16.301
you should know that I've kept
one of your siblings alive as collateral.

01:40:17.300 --> 01:40:18.759
And, after all...

01:40:19.342 --> 01:40:23.134
anyone who's willing to sacrifice
their own flesh and blood...

01:40:23.967 --> 01:40:25.801
can never be fully trusted.

01:40:36.842 --> 01:40:37.843
So...

01:40:39.092 --> 01:40:43.218
how does it feel to be the one
and only Karen Settman?

01:40:50.383 --> 01:40:53.759
When you get into the main server,
use the code Friday wrote.

01:40:53.842 --> 01:40:55.551
Cayman's speech starts in 15 minutes.

01:40:57.717 --> 01:41:01.134
- Let's go.
- Let's take this bitch down.

01:41:48.342 --> 01:41:49.343
Fuck.

01:41:53.300 --> 01:41:55.259
Nobody moves!

01:41:58.883 --> 01:42:00.176
Show me your hands!

01:42:01.800 --> 01:42:02.801
Open the door!

01:42:04.383 --> 01:42:07.801
- Open the fucking now or I'll shoot him!
- Do it! Do it.

01:43:35.217 --> 01:43:36.218
Monday.

01:43:40.508 --> 01:43:41.551
I'm impressed.

01:43:42.883 --> 01:43:45.384
You've never worn Karen Settman so well.

01:43:49.717 --> 01:43:53.343
- You think you own her. You don't.
- I do her justice.

01:43:55.092 --> 01:43:56.093
You only pretend.

01:44:03.425 --> 01:44:07.926
<i>Thank you for coming this evening.
I'm deeply honored and grateful.</i>

01:44:12.592 --> 01:44:15.926
I gotta get to Cayman.
Get her away from the servers.

01:44:29.133 --> 01:44:30.343
You sold us out.

01:44:31.717 --> 01:44:32.926
How could you?

01:44:33.758 --> 01:44:36.593
I thought you, of all people,
would understand.

01:44:37.258 --> 01:44:40.093
Understand? We were your family.

01:44:40.175 --> 01:44:41.926
What do you know about family?

01:44:45.133 --> 01:44:49.051
All these years of endless lectures
on responsibility and sacrifice?

01:44:49.550 --> 01:44:52.343
I never saw you do any of it, not once.

01:44:55.467 --> 01:44:57.384
I did everything I was told.

01:44:58.258 --> 01:44:59.551
Everything right.

01:44:59.633 --> 01:45:01.968
I did everything I could
to protect our family.

01:45:04.300 --> 01:45:06.009
You have a funny way of showing it.

01:45:11.925 --> 01:45:14.218
Sunday died in my arms.

01:45:17.842 --> 01:45:19.634
Wednesday fell to her death.

01:45:19.717 --> 01:45:22.634
Saturday was shot in the head, and Friday...

01:45:30.633 --> 01:45:32.218
I didn't plan this.

01:45:36.133 --> 01:45:38.134
I met Adrian and I fell in love.

01:45:40.342 --> 01:45:41.634
And things changed.

01:45:43.383 --> 01:45:47.218
I made a deal with Cayman, and...
it got out of my control.

01:45:50.675 --> 01:45:51.676
I'm sorry.

01:45:57.467 --> 01:46:00.593
I'm sorry you...
you lost your finger because of me.

01:46:02.342 --> 01:46:04.843
I was a... I was a total fuck-up.

01:46:06.883 --> 01:46:09.593
If I could go back
and change it all, I would.

01:46:14.133 --> 01:46:15.551
Karen Settman...

01:46:16.800 --> 01:46:19.093
was so much more than any one of us.

01:46:21.592 --> 01:46:22.843
She was all of us.

01:46:26.800 --> 01:46:28.009
She was our family.

01:46:33.717 --> 01:46:35.468
I was the firstborn.

01:46:37.175 --> 01:46:39.134
Karen Settman was always mine.

01:46:40.717 --> 01:46:41.718
The rest of you?

01:46:42.758 --> 01:46:44.593
You were just afterbirth.

01:46:54.800 --> 01:46:59.759
For three decades,
the Child Allocation Bureau has combatted

01:46:59.842 --> 01:47:04.384
the most serious crisis
our world has ever faced.

01:47:04.467 --> 01:47:06.926
Catastrophic overpopulation.

01:47:11.550 --> 01:47:14.218
Critics may chastise our methods,

01:47:14.842 --> 01:47:17.509
but the numbers don't lie.

01:47:31.883 --> 01:47:38.093
In a perfect world,
every child has the right to live.

01:47:47.842 --> 01:47:50.634
That's why I'm running for office.

01:47:51.383 --> 01:47:53.634
So I can reform the law.

01:48:22.425 --> 01:48:26.051
<i>Anyone who wants to bring a child
into this world</i>

01:48:26.133 --> 01:48:30.134
must be able to prove financial stability...

01:48:33.842 --> 01:48:35.218
<i>and be able to guarantee</i>

01:48:35.300 --> 01:48:39.676
the emotional and physical
well-being of that child.

01:48:46.925 --> 01:48:49.551
<i>There may even be room for siblings...</i>

01:48:51.133 --> 01:48:53.134
if the data measures up.

01:49:06.092 --> 01:49:07.884
<i>So I commend you for your vision</i>

01:49:08.467 --> 01:49:13.343
as we continue to take positive action
to build a sustainable future

01:49:13.425 --> 01:49:15.676
full of hope and possibility.

01:49:21.800 --> 01:49:22.884
Together...

01:49:27.050 --> 01:49:28.051
<i>we will...</i>

01:49:32.633 --> 01:49:33.509
survive.

01:50:04.258 --> 01:50:05.259
Are you okay?

01:50:22.592 --> 01:50:23.593
Hit it.

01:51:20.883 --> 01:51:22.259
They didn't suffer.

01:51:23.633 --> 01:51:24.801
No, they didn't suffer.

01:51:25.592 --> 01:51:29.801
They didn't suffer. They didn't suffer!

01:51:47.675 --> 01:51:48.843
What have you done?

01:51:50.675 --> 01:51:51.968
What have you done?

01:52:48.842 --> 01:52:49.843
<i>Monday.</i>

01:52:52.092 --> 01:52:53.634
I need you to be brave.

01:52:54.008 --> 01:52:56.051
Set an example for your sisters.

01:53:36.883 --> 01:53:38.426
I'm just trying to protect you.

01:53:45.508 --> 01:53:47.176
I'm so sorry.

01:54:26.133 --> 01:54:27.134
Promise me...

01:54:33.467 --> 01:54:35.384
Don't let them take them.

01:54:43.633 --> 01:54:45.176
Don't let them take them.

01:55:15.217 --> 01:55:17.593
Hey, baby. Hey, baby.

01:55:18.592 --> 01:55:19.593
Stay with me, okay?

01:55:22.008 --> 01:55:23.009
Oh...

01:55:27.258 --> 01:55:31.134
Baby, you're okay. Baby. Baby.

01:55:50.758 --> 01:55:55.259
Federation-wide rioting has forced
the repeal of the Child Allocation Act.

01:55:55.800 --> 01:55:59.509
Hundreds of siblings held
in processing centers have been released.

01:56:00.217 --> 01:56:02.968
Pregnant women
are coming out of hiding in droves,

01:56:03.050 --> 01:56:05.176
the majority from poorest districts.

01:56:05.633 --> 01:56:06.801
Without this repeal,

01:56:06.883 --> 01:56:10.218
many of these children would
have been discarded or processed

01:56:10.300 --> 01:56:12.176
the minute they were born.

01:56:18.050 --> 01:56:20.968
This planet is the only home
you will ever know.

01:56:23.633 --> 01:56:24.634
So, look around.

01:56:25.925 --> 01:56:27.093
Ask yourselves.

01:56:30.050 --> 01:56:33.593
Who will continue to make
the difficult decisions

01:56:33.675 --> 01:56:35.301
that will ensure your survival?

01:56:38.758 --> 01:56:39.759
My regret...

01:56:43.675 --> 01:56:46.759
My regret is that your children
will never know

01:56:46.842 --> 01:56:49.259
the world we could have built together.

01:56:51.133 --> 01:56:52.926
That hope is gone forever.

01:57:04.317 --> 01:57:06.009
I like your new eye, Tuesday.

01:57:09.300 --> 01:57:11.593
- They did a good job.
- Thank you.

01:57:14.467 --> 01:57:17.593
Oh, it's not Tuesday anymore. It's Terry.

01:57:18.275 --> 01:57:20.426
Okay. Terry.

01:57:26.508 --> 01:57:27.509
So...

01:57:29.717 --> 01:57:30.718
what should I call you?

01:57:34.175 --> 01:57:35.176
Karen.

01:57:37.800 --> 01:57:38.801
Karen Settman.

01:57:49.633 --> 01:57:51.634
Monday did it all for them.

01:57:52.883 --> 01:57:54.384
She wanted them to be safe.

01:57:57.800 --> 01:57:59.218
Well...

01:58:00.633 --> 01:58:02.051
they will be.

01:58:03.305 --> 01:58:09.299
