That's me comin' over.
I was merely doing my job.

00:07.939 --> 00:09.808
What did you say to this man?

00:09.874 --> 00:12.076
Well, I don't remember
my exact words,
but I told him...

00:12.143 --> 00:15.146
he couldn't leave the store
until I checked
the contents of his bag.

00:15.213 --> 00:18.081
When I asked to look in his bag,
he got all belligerent.

00:18.148 --> 00:21.117

Who?

00:21.184 --> 00:24.086

00:24.153 --> 00:26.888
[ Man ] He started hasslin' me,
and I explained to him
it was none of his business.

00:26.955 --> 00:29.658

But he continued.
I asked him to step back again.

And that's when
this kid with the gym bag
slams me into the display case.

00:34.261 --> 00:37.997
I regained my balance.
Then suddenly, there's these
other kids that joined him.

00:38.064 --> 00:40.399

They throw me to the ground.

00:40.466 --> 00:42.435

The guard pulls him off.

01:05.888 --> 01:08.557
He throws him into a table.

to detain him and-- Here.

was a sub-compact,
not a sedan.

And she told us we were in
a romantic, adults-only hotel,

04:19.415 --> 04:21.281

most definitely not.

it can be very difficult
to sue travel agencies.

"On this occasion."

05:17.128 --> 05:21.299
- Mr. Robinson, how long have
you worked at SaveWorld Drugs?
- Five and a half years.

05:21.366 --> 05:24.869
[ Eugene ] And in that time,
it was your job to manage
the store, hire employees,

05:24.935 --> 05:28.238
interact with the
customer base, correct?
Correct.

05:28.305 --> 05:31.975
About what percentage of that
base would you say were from
the African-American community?

05:32.041 --> 05:33.909
Fifty percent?

05:33.976 --> 05:39.447
Fifty percent? Actually,
SaveWorld's own figures
show that, uh,

05:39.514 --> 05:42.383
56% of your customer base
were African-American.

05:42.449 --> 05:45.186
Well, then I guess
that's the case.

05:45.252 --> 05:49.022
Is anyone besides you
empowered to stop
suspected shoplifters?

05:49.089 --> 05:50.956
No. Just me.

05:51.023 --> 05:53.258
And how often do you stop
customers for shoplifting?

05:53.325 --> 05:55.727
Probably once or twice a day.

05:55.794 --> 05:58.963
[ Eugene ]
So with the average month
being 30 days,

05:59.030 --> 06:02.266
and you being open
seven days a week,
that would be...

06:02.333 --> 06:05.002
60-some odd
customers stopped.

06:05.068 --> 06:07.137
- Uh, sound right?
- Yes.

06:07.204 --> 06:10.239
And in the last month,
how many customers have
you stopped that were white?

06:10.306 --> 06:12.508
I know what
you're trying to do.

06:12.574 --> 06:14.410

06:14.476 --> 06:17.278
I don't recall.

06:17.345 --> 06:20.848

You don't recall stopping
any white customers?

06:20.915 --> 06:23.283
Or you don't recall
stopping any white customers
in the last month?

06:23.350 --> 06:25.019
Or you just don't
recall anything?

06:25.085 --> 06:27.454
I don't recall stopping
any white customers.

06:27.521 --> 06:29.956
So even though 44%
of your customers are white,

06:30.023 --> 06:32.024
zero percent were
stopped for shoplifting?

06:32.090 --> 06:36.661
That would mean 100%
of suspected shoplifters
were African-American.

06:41.198 --> 06:46.102

I think-- I think Oren
has a tennis racquet.

11:45.384 --> 11:47.285
How about bicycling?

11:47.351 --> 11:50.621
Irritates.
I get a yeast flare-up.
Is this really necessary?

11:50.688 --> 11:53.123
I'm just trying
to establish your expectations
for the honeymoon.

11:53.190 --> 11:56.058
It would be very helpful
if you could just
write a list of things...

you know, hobbies or--

11:58.227 --> 12:00.762
Okay, I've only
been with the guy
four and a half months.

12:00.829 --> 12:03.398
It's not like I know him
inside out, okay?
All right.

12:03.465 --> 12:06.701
Oh! Mush.

12:09.169 --> 12:12.006
We can't just switch
from assault to homicide
in the middle of a trial.

12:12.072 --> 12:15.274
We put them on notice
from the start.
This should be a mistrial.

12:15.341 --> 12:18.511
- Same facts, same case.
- Except now,
you're switching to homicide.

12:18.577 --> 12:21.479
- It's either
new trial or mistrial.
- I'm afraid it's neither.

12:21.546 --> 12:23.815
You're not prejudiced by this.
It doesn't affect the evidence.

12:23.881 --> 12:25.783
And you knew
they might do this.

12:25.850 --> 12:29.420
You can't just add a charge
in the middle of a trial.
That's unprecedented.

12:29.486 --> 12:33.223
It's not unprecedented.
It might be irregular, but you
take that up with appeals.

12:33.289 --> 12:35.225
Now, this case goes on
with the manslaughter charge.

12:38.493 --> 12:42.531
Can you describe
the scene for us when
you first arrived at 4:15?

12:42.597 --> 12:46.534
There were people
running out of the store
carrying merchandise.

12:46.600 --> 12:49.803
Other people from the street
were rushing back inside
at the same time.

12:49.870 --> 12:53.573
That's when I saw the body
crash through the front window.

12:53.640 --> 12:57.176
And that would be
the body of the deceased,
Mr. Roman Rosemont?

12:57.243 --> 13:00.912
-Yes, ma'am.
-Did you see who actually hurled
the body through the window?

13:00.979 --> 13:03.514
<i>Objection. Counsel</i>
<i>has not established...</i>

13:03.581 --> 13:07.517
that Mr. Rosemont
was "hurled"
or otherwise acted upon.

13:07.585 --> 13:11.321
- Overruled.
- What did you see, Officer?

13:11.388 --> 13:14.690
I saw the defendant,
Mr. Wilton, standing on
the other side of the window.

13:14.757 --> 13:16.692
And did he see you?

13:16.759 --> 13:19.494
Did he say anything to you?
[ Whispering ]

13:19.561 --> 13:21.329
Objection.
Leading the witness.

13:21.396 --> 13:25.399
I'll rephrase, Your Honor.
Officer Tedesco,

13:25.466 --> 13:29.069
when you saw Mr. Wilton
standing in the window
of the SaveWorld Drugs,

13:29.135 --> 13:30.737
what did he do?

13:30.804 --> 13:34.240
- Object to the form.
- What happened when
Mr. Wilton saw you?

13:34.307 --> 13:38.143
He said,
"Whose side are you on,
brother?

13:38.210 --> 13:40.312
You should be helping us
to burn this place down."

13:40.379 --> 13:43.647
[ Woman ]
And what do you think
he meant by that remark?

13:43.714 --> 13:45.416
- Objection.
- Overruled.

13:47.418 --> 13:50.753
He wanted me to join him and
the others destroying the store.

13:52.422 --> 13:54.423
<i>[ Woman ]</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

14:01.562 --> 14:03.798
We're in trouble.
We took a hit.
We can recover.

14:03.864 --> 14:05.866
We gotta buy some time.
We're still okay.

14:05.933 --> 14:07.934
We start with the customers
in the store.

14:08.002 --> 14:10.437
Diandra Jackson,
Ty Mallone--

14:10.504 --> 14:13.206
The ones who will swear
it was the store manager
who provoked Aaron.

14:13.272 --> 14:15.474
It's still
justified defense of others,
and we just keep goin'--

14:15.541 --> 14:19.777
<i>Eugene.</i>
<i>The jury just heard</i>
<i>intent to commit.</i>

14:19.844 --> 14:22.480
Whatever liberal sympathy
we had, it's gone now.

14:22.547 --> 14:26.417
He's the angry
black killer now.
Let's not kid ourselves.

14:28.852 --> 14:32.121
- Maybe we should go with that.
- What?

14:32.188 --> 14:35.858
The Reginald Denny beating.
Remember after the L.A. riots?

14:35.925 --> 14:38.293
<i>That's how they got</i>
<i>those guys off.</i>

14:38.360 --> 14:43.164
- How?
- It was called
a social deviance defense.

14:43.231 --> 14:46.033
As angry black men,
they had this right to explode.

14:46.099 --> 14:48.435
<i>The jury bought it.</i>

14:52.438 --> 14:55.941
It's not my theory.
I'm just sayin'
that's what they used.

14:56.007 --> 14:59.610
Look it up.
Dr. Troub, Alvin,
whatever his name was.

14:59.677 --> 15:02.012
He was the expert
on the Hilburn case.

15:02.079 --> 15:03.714
[ Lindsay ]
We don't have a Reginald Denny
situation here.

15:03.781 --> 15:06.816
We have
an upper-middle-class defendant,
college-educated--

15:06.883 --> 15:10.053
Not only that, we spent
the last two weeks buildin' up
that he's an upstanding citizen.

15:10.119 --> 15:13.322
Now we're gonna chuck all of
that and make him a poster boy
for Negro inferiority?

15:13.389 --> 15:16.024
It's an option.
Maybe the only one
we have left.

15:16.091 --> 15:17.792
He won't do it.
He's too proud.

15:17.859 --> 15:21.195
Well, 15 years to life
is a high price for pride.

15:29.169 --> 15:31.904
Jimmy, see if we can still
argue diminished capacity.

15:31.971 --> 15:34.106
We should be able to
since they added homicide.

15:37.175 --> 15:39.243
I think we gotta
at least take it to him.

15:46.716 --> 15:49.719
Please, tell me
you're not serious.

15:49.786 --> 15:53.189
I'm not necessarily
recommending it, Aaron.

15:53.255 --> 15:55.557
You're talking about
humiliating me...

15:55.624 --> 15:58.859
in front of my friends,
my family, the whole world.

15:58.926 --> 16:01.428
How the hell is that
supposed to help me?

16:01.495 --> 16:04.564
It helps by maybe
keeping you out of jail.

16:04.631 --> 16:07.834
Explain this to me again.

16:07.901 --> 16:10.269
You argue
that he's a deviant?

16:10.336 --> 16:13.638
We would argue that he has
a pathological tendency
towards violence.

16:13.706 --> 16:17.074
Like a wild monkey defense?

16:17.141 --> 16:20.211
Like I said,
I'm not recommending it.

16:20.277 --> 16:23.179
Then why are you even
presenting it, man?

16:23.246 --> 16:25.581
Because you're staring at
a possible homicide conviction.

16:25.648 --> 16:29.351
Even if we get it chopped down
to involuntary manslaughter,
you're lookin' at five.

16:29.419 --> 16:33.155
[ Woman ]
I still don't understand...

16:33.222 --> 16:35.757
the "group contagion" part.

16:35.824 --> 16:41.529
Basically, instead of tryin'
to argue defense of others,
we argue that...

16:41.595 --> 16:44.831
once the people started fightin'
around you, you kind of
went on automatic pilot.

16:44.897 --> 16:49.001
That's where the
"social deviant" thing comes in.

16:49.068 --> 16:52.003
We say you lacked the power
to stay out of it.

16:52.070 --> 16:54.873
You really expect me
to testify to that?

16:54.940 --> 16:57.708
Something to that effect.

16:57.775 --> 17:00.344
But if he testifies,
doesn't the previous
conviction come in?

17:00.410 --> 17:02.379
We want it in.
It works for us now.

17:02.446 --> 17:05.348
Oh.
Oh, it works <i>for</i> us now?
I see.

17:05.414 --> 17:08.117
The strategy has changed, Aaron.
That's what I'm tryin'
to tell you, man.

17:08.184 --> 17:11.553
Before, we were arguing
you were justified.

17:11.618 --> 17:16.924
Now, it's more like insanity.
You got this pathological thing
that makes you violent.

17:23.628 --> 17:25.565
No.

17:27.633 --> 17:31.336
- Aaron--
- Baby, no!

17:33.905 --> 17:38.976
I mean, how am I--
How am I supposed
to walk back into work...

17:39.042 --> 17:43.180
<i>after I say I'm some kind</i>
<i>of pathological,</i>
<i>violent animal?</i>

17:43.246 --> 17:47.916
You don't get to walk back
into work if you're in prison.

17:47.984 --> 17:50.085
What about our son?

17:52.020 --> 17:55.823
Our home?
Our life together?

17:55.890 --> 17:57.958
What about all that?

17:59.459 --> 18:02.295
Baby, you're suggesting
that I pretend to be
a social deviant?

18:02.361 --> 18:05.664
I don't know!
[ Sobbing ]

18:09.334 --> 18:11.336
I don't know.

18:17.608 --> 18:21.945
It's not a strong case,
but it's makable.

18:22.012 --> 18:25.481
With just two crimes?
Two assault crimes.

18:25.548 --> 18:30.184
Together with his past history--
getting pulled over,
falsely accused--

18:30.251 --> 18:33.054
Every black man in America
has that history.

18:33.121 --> 18:35.456
As I said,
it's not a strong case.

18:35.523 --> 18:37.725
But all you need
is reasonable doubt.

18:37.791 --> 18:41.261
Doctor, we're in the middle
of the trial. Could you
possibly testify tomorrow?

18:41.328 --> 18:45.797
No problem.
All I need to do
is interview Mr. Wilton.

18:45.864 --> 18:49.000
And I would need
$10,000 in advance.

18:52.137 --> 18:54.572
And, uh,
if you could think...

18:54.639 --> 18:59.008
of any other
horrible things you've done,
it would be helpful.

19:08.450 --> 19:12.386
So basically,
we're betting everything
on this <i>theory.</i>

19:12.453 --> 19:15.989
Bobby will question the doctor.
It'll be better coming from him.

19:16.056 --> 19:20.293
He'll do you as well,
and I'll do the closing.

19:20.360 --> 19:22.695
You don't feel
a little funny about this?

19:22.762 --> 19:27.232
Funny? It makes me sick.
But let's get
the acquittal first.

19:27.299 --> 19:29.400
[ Bobby ]
Yeah, let's get the acquittal.

19:29.467 --> 19:33.404
Now, come on.
We do what we have to do.

19:33.471 --> 19:36.739
We're not losing here.
We're not losing.

19:43.045 --> 19:46.882
Mrs. Kramer,
I really appreciate you
coming down here today.

19:46.948 --> 19:49.750
I've advised Mrs. Kramer
not to say anything
at this time until we can--

19:49.817 --> 19:52.119
Listen, young lady,
I've been in this business
for 30 years,

19:52.186 --> 19:54.621
and I've never carried
liability insurance.

19:54.688 --> 19:56.756
Who ever heard of suing
your travel agent?

19:56.823 --> 19:59.959
Well, Myra Glenn
feels that her damages
are very real.

20:00.026 --> 20:03.161
Our position remains, however,
until we have--
Damages? Name them.

20:03.228 --> 20:05.864
Uh, inconvenience,

20:05.931 --> 20:08.900
fraudulent representations,
and, um,

20:08.966 --> 20:11.235
impediment to, uh,
sexual satisfaction.

20:11.302 --> 20:15.772
I can't promise you anything,
but there may still be room
in all of this for a settlement.

20:15.839 --> 20:18.908
We might look
very favorably upon--
Not the skinniest of a chance.

20:18.974 --> 20:22.311
Mrs. Kramer, you can't deny
that there were foul-ups
on the honeymoon.

20:22.377 --> 20:24.646
Can I tell you something?

20:24.713 --> 20:28.249
When I went on my honeymoon,
my husband Hershel--
may he rest in peace--

20:28.316 --> 20:30.484
never made a big deal
of the sex.

20:30.551 --> 20:34.187
Gracie--
We talked. We played canasta.
We'd go for a stroll.

20:34.254 --> 20:37.056
We really got
to know each other.

20:37.123 --> 20:40.192
There was still time for love,
but it wasn't
the be-all and end-all...

20:40.259 --> 20:42.528
that these kids
make it out to be.

20:42.594 --> 20:45.463
No. No settlement.

20:45.530 --> 20:47.532
And if you're their adviser,
Ms. Frutt,

20:47.598 --> 20:50.501
you tell them
what really matters
in a relationship.

20:56.973 --> 21:01.276
<i>[ Door Opens, Closes ]</i>
Maybe we could work this out.

21:01.343 --> 21:05.513
Yeah.
That would be nice.

21:08.082 --> 21:12.553
Could you explain to the court
the science of
urban anthropology?

21:12.619 --> 21:16.422
Urban anthropology is
the study of human interaction
in the inner cities.

21:16.489 --> 21:19.859
And in all your years
as an urban anthropologist,

21:19.925 --> 21:24.095
have you ever studied situations
like the riot that occurred
in Brighton, Massachusetts?

21:24.162 --> 21:28.766
Many times. In fact, I authored
a paper published in the
Journal of Urban Studies...

21:28.832 --> 21:31.168
<i>entitled</i>
<i>"Group Contagion</i>
<i>and Racial Violence."</i>

21:31.234 --> 21:33.503
Is this the journal?
<i>Yes.</i>

21:33.570 --> 21:39.341
If you would read
from your article
this paragraph right here.

21:42.611 --> 21:45.113
"It is the finding of this study
that group violence...

21:45.180 --> 21:47.214
"often triggers
a contagious behavior...

21:47.281 --> 21:51.485
"within the African-American
community which aggravates
in African-American males...

21:51.551 --> 21:56.455
an innate pathological tendency
to commit acts of violence."

21:56.522 --> 22:01.193
Well, that is
a pretty bold statement,
don't you think, Doctor?

22:01.259 --> 22:03.261
Aren't you concerned
with being labeled a racist?

22:03.328 --> 22:05.697
[ Troub ]
My concern is scientific study.

22:05.763 --> 22:07.464
Racism plays no part in it.

22:07.531 --> 22:09.833
I see.
If you would read...

22:09.900 --> 22:13.869
the rest of
the outlined portion aloud,
right here.

22:13.937 --> 22:17.707
"This frenzy of aggression
precludes the individual
African-American male...

22:17.773 --> 22:21.276
from forming a specific intent
to hurt or commit mayhem."

22:21.343 --> 22:24.045
- Oh, give me a break.
- Ms. Hart.

22:24.112 --> 22:26.547
In simpler language, Doctor?

22:26.614 --> 22:30.717
We found that black men
cannot be held psychologically
accountable for their actions...

22:30.783 --> 22:33.820
when taken over by this form
of temporary insanity.

22:33.886 --> 22:38.124
It's not unlike pack behavior
you see among many
animal groups.

22:38.190 --> 22:41.192
Objection, Your Honor!
Are we supposed to allow
this racist quackery...

22:41.259 --> 22:43.428
to be passed off
as legitimate science?

22:43.494 --> 22:49.166
The court's position is not
to judge scientific validity,
Ms. Hart. Only relevancy.

22:49.233 --> 22:52.736
- <i>Overruled.</i>
- Doctor, help us out here.

22:52.802 --> 22:56.872
How do you account for this--
this tendency among black males?

22:56.939 --> 23:00.875
The group contagion comes
from commonly shared
emotions of frustration,

23:00.942 --> 23:05.512
<i>from feeling locked out</i>
<i>from full participation</i>
<i>in society.</i>

23:05.579 --> 23:07.681
<i>And when a situation</i>
<i>presents itself...</i>

23:07.748 --> 23:11.317
that gives them a way
to release that
powerful frustration,

23:11.384 --> 23:13.753
it's like lighting a spark
to an explosive.

23:13.819 --> 23:16.922
- It can't help but blow up.
- And this impulse--

23:16.989 --> 23:19.624
this tendency to violence--
you don't find among whites?

23:19.691 --> 23:21.726
No.
Hispanics?

23:21.793 --> 23:23.661
No.
Asians?

23:23.727 --> 23:25.929
No.
Only African-American males
in a group setting...

23:25.996 --> 23:29.932
may be incapable
of resisting
this contagious violence,

23:29.999 --> 23:31.768
like victims of a disease.

23:31.834 --> 23:36.172
So black men
just can't lay off violence?

23:36.238 --> 23:39.707
What I said was
in some situations--
I heard what you said.

23:39.775 --> 23:44.144
Blacks are subject
to group contagion,
which is basically mob violence.

23:44.211 --> 23:47.047
I said
in some situations,

23:47.114 --> 23:52.651
depending upon the underlying
sociological history,
that pathology can develop, yes.

23:52.718 --> 23:55.654
And I'm certainly not
the only doctor or professor
to make this claim.

23:55.721 --> 23:58.623
But you're the one
making it today, Doctor.

23:58.690 --> 24:01.192
I sit here saying
that it is possible.

24:01.258 --> 24:04.228
Possible...
when the price is right.

24:04.295 --> 24:07.598
<i>[ Bobby ] Objection.</i>
How much are you charging
for today's testimony?

24:07.664 --> 24:09.699
Objection.
<i>[ Judge ]</i>
<i>Overruled.</i>

24:09.765 --> 24:13.168
- I'm interested to know myself.
- How much, Doctor?

24:13.235 --> 24:16.938
$10,000.

24:17.005 --> 24:21.542
Plus expenses.
You charge for mileage?
Yes.

24:21.609 --> 24:25.278
And in preparation
for today's expert testimony,

24:25.345 --> 24:27.247
how much time did you spend
with the defendant...

Well, because I've been stopped

than the fact that I'm black.

[ Bobby ] Your Honor,
this case today revolves around
the issue of group contagion.

28:36.720 --> 28:39.322
As we have already established
by Dr. Alvin Troub,

28:39.388 --> 28:44.460
"tendency to violence" pathology
may not be limited
to single incidents.

28:44.527 --> 28:47.162

beat up this man.

Now he's testifying.
- Withdrawn.

28:50.932 --> 28:54.635
Did you and your friends
assault Samuel Baxter?

28:54.701 --> 28:57.137
Okay, look, that happened
such a long time ago--

28:57.203 --> 28:59.705
- You were drinking?
- Yes.

28:59.772 --> 29:03.809
And this man, a custodian,
asked you to pick up
some bottles?

29:03.876 --> 29:05.777
- Yes.
- And you beat him up.

29:05.844 --> 29:08.747
Things just
got out of control.

29:08.813 --> 29:12.283
- The four of you beat him up.
- A fight ensued.

29:12.350 --> 29:15.853
This man asked you
to pick up some bottles,
and you beat him half to death.

29:15.919 --> 29:19.489
I read the police report.
Why'd you do that?

29:19.556 --> 29:21.457
I don't know.
Couldn't help yourself?

29:21.523 --> 29:23.425
I said I don't know.

29:23.492 --> 29:27.162
<i>At the time of the incident</i>
<i>in question today,</i>
<i>did you know that...</i>

by the surveillance camera?

29:31.165 --> 29:33.200
Yes.

29:33.267 --> 29:35.535
Well, if you knew that you'd be
identified and arrested,

why didn't you alter
your behavior?

- You don't know?

29:39.038 --> 29:41.807
I don't know!

29:47.379 --> 29:50.547
Could it be that
you lost control?

29:55.185 --> 29:57.687
You look like you're ready
to lose it now, Aaron.

30:01.924 --> 30:05.560
Legal experts acknowledge
that the strategy
is an enormous risk,

30:05.627 --> 30:09.130
but one that
Wilton's defense attorneys
must think is necessary.

30:09.197 --> 30:13.433
It's as if with an
all-white jury, they figure
race will be a factor.

30:13.500 --> 30:17.537
So rather than beat
the potential racism, why not
use it to your advantage?

30:17.604 --> 30:20.639
<i>This is Melanie Morris--</i>
I'd say that nail
got hit on the head.

30:20.706 --> 30:24.309
It isn't that simple.
Really?

30:24.375 --> 30:30.147
Look. I'm not gonna pretend
that I am proud of this defense.

30:30.214 --> 30:32.649
But how is that different
from what we did
in the Braun case?

30:32.716 --> 30:35.852
We argued that the guy
had a Jewish right to revenge.

30:35.919 --> 30:38.554
- This is a lot different.
- Why?

30:38.621 --> 30:40.188
Gerald Braun
avenged the death
of his daughter.

30:40.255 --> 30:43.225
We argued that he was acting out
of some kind of moral outrage,
and he was.

30:43.291 --> 30:46.861
There's nothing moral about
the arguments we're making now,
and you know it.

30:46.928 --> 30:49.530
I know you are angry,
and Rebecca's out
with the blue flu.

30:49.596 --> 30:53.800
You don't think
I know what that's about?
But this is what we do, Eugene!

30:53.867 --> 30:57.036
Sometimes we--
Hey! I know what we do!

30:57.102 --> 30:59.939
We get people off!
We're good lawyers. We come up
with the best defenses.

31:00.005 --> 31:04.743
There's nothin'
we won't stoop to.
We're the best!

31:04.809 --> 31:06.877
I know what we do.

31:23.925 --> 31:26.260
Eugene, are you ready?
Ready.

31:26.327 --> 31:29.763
Eugene, for us to have
any chance, you gotta
go all out in there.

31:29.829 --> 31:31.798
I know.
I'm ready.

31:31.865 --> 31:36.035
And also,
how difficult this is--

31:36.102 --> 31:38.070
I do understand.

31:45.843 --> 31:48.179
<i>It was successful</i>
<i>in Los Angeles.</i>

31:48.245 --> 31:50.380
If you remember, after
the Reginald Denny beating,

31:50.446 --> 31:52.415
lawyers got acquittals
by arguing--

31:52.482 --> 31:56.686

the group contagion theory
of mob violence.

Emotional outpouring
of violence.

31:59.021 --> 32:00.989
Now basically,
the argument is that...

32:01.055 --> 32:04.658

the specific intent
to commit mayhem.

32:04.725 --> 32:06.660
It ain't dull here.

Nope. Fun place.

32:11.364 --> 32:13.332
What we thought,
given the nature of the suit,

32:13.399 --> 32:15.567
you might want to submit
to binding arbitration.

32:15.634 --> 32:18.637
I don't--
I don't want arbitration.
I want my day in court.

32:18.704 --> 32:21.206

you might be spending a dollar
to save 50 cents.

32:21.272 --> 32:24.742
I don't want arbitration.
I want my day in court.

32:24.809 --> 32:28.378
I'm not afraid of a trial.
Why are you?
I am not af--

32:28.445 --> 32:30.747
All right.
Would you consider
small claims court?

32:30.814 --> 32:34.017
Small claims court?
Don't you wanna handle this?

32:34.083 --> 32:37.585
Well, to be perfectly honest,
Myra, I think this case
is a bit of a nuisance suit.

32:37.653 --> 32:40.655
- Tell me about it.
- Let's not inflame
the situation.

32:40.722 --> 32:44.458
Oh, quiet. You fight fire
with fire. And don't
tell me not to inflame!

32:44.525 --> 32:46.893
Okay, this doesn't have
to be a fight.

32:46.960 --> 32:49.595
Yes, of course
it is a fight!
Why do you think we hired you,

32:49.662 --> 32:51.531
to lick opposing counsel's
earlobes?

32:51.597 --> 32:55.067
Okay. You know what?
I'm gonna need a little time

<i>Do you mind?</i>
No, that's fine.

33:01.906 --> 33:05.976

I know this now means you have
to be alone with yours.

33:06.043 --> 33:07.978
Thank you.

33:14.650 --> 33:20.088
This... isn't a case

I've been falsely accused
of shoplifting...
three times.

33:24.491 --> 33:27.827

<i>followed around in stores.</i>

33:32.231 --> 33:35.467

33:35.533 --> 33:39.203
But the answer isn't a riot.

33:39.271 --> 33:44.308
And the answer most certainly
is not throwing somebody
through a window.

33:44.375 --> 33:49.145
Basically, they're
asking you to accept...

33:49.212 --> 33:53.682
that when black angry men
are in a group,

33:53.748 --> 33:56.184
it's an excuse
to kill somebody.

33:58.286 --> 34:02.890
And that should offend you
as civic-minded people.

34:03.991 --> 34:06.026
<i>And the suggestion...</i>

34:06.093 --> 34:09.295
that blacks should be given
some special exception...

34:09.360 --> 34:14.966
because we, as a race,
are just less able
to resist violence--

34:16.501 --> 34:18.402
That's obscene.

34:20.571 --> 34:23.306
And as a black woman, you--

I'll tell you.

"Group contagion."

35:21.655 --> 35:23.523
Our evidence was uncontested.

35:23.590 --> 35:26.759
We put the leading
urban anthropologist
on the stand here,

35:26.825 --> 35:30.996

cannot be held
psychologically accountable...

35:31.063 --> 35:33.231
for his actions
when he's in a pack.

35:33.298 --> 35:37.334
He has a susceptibility
to group violence.
Something animal takes over.

35:37.401 --> 35:40.504

- I'm doing my closing!

See, what happened here
is that...

35:58.419 --> 36:02.422
this man got frustrated,
and he fought back.

36:02.489 --> 36:05.424
He was justified.
But as a legal strategy,

36:05.491 --> 36:08.694
we didn't think
we could get you to believe
he was justified.

36:08.760 --> 36:13.331
We thought we'd have a better
chance of convincing a white
jury that he was an animal.

36:13.398 --> 36:17.768
<i>So it became</i>
<i>good legal strategy</i>
<i>to argue that our client...</i>

36:17.835 --> 36:21.771
was like some pack animal,
a social deviant,
and it's crap.

36:21.838 --> 36:25.641

He is a very good man.

36:36.550 --> 36:38.419
He just finally had had it.

36:38.485 --> 36:41.387
Seeing somebody
being falsely accused,
he sticks up for him.

<i>This thing breaks out.</i>
<i>Security officers</i>
<i>are jumpin' on him.</i>

36:44.189 --> 36:47.459
He had damn well had it.
And if you don't understand...

36:47.526 --> 36:52.797
how this man could
impulsively lash out,
well, all you prove...

36:52.864 --> 36:54.932
is that you don't understand.

36:54.998 --> 37:00.403
Oh, I know you can sympathize,
but until you've been
yanked out of your car,

37:00.470 --> 37:03.305
until you've been searched
just because of how you look,

37:03.372 --> 37:06.942
until you see the look of fear
in somebody else's eyes...
