WEBVTT

00:09.910 --> 00:12.346
And Bonnie here
is a bromeliad.

00:12.446 --> 00:13.814
Please don't ask
me to spell that.

00:13.914 --> 00:16.784
And so she needs
to be kept moist,

00:16.884 --> 00:18.186
but not soggy.

00:18.286 --> 00:19.953
Also...

00:20.054 --> 00:22.523
she likes to be whispered to.

00:23.857 --> 00:25.259
Full disclosure.

00:25.359 --> 00:27.595
I probably won't
do that last part.

00:27.695 --> 00:29.297
I appreciate your honesty.

00:29.397 --> 00:30.698
And your excellent note-taking.

00:30.798 --> 00:32.566
Don't sound so surprised,
Mr. Harding.

00:32.666 --> 00:34.068
I am surprised, Libby.

00:34.168 --> 00:35.769
Why? Because I'm young

00:35.869 --> 00:37.605
and people my age are
usually cynical?

00:37.705 --> 00:39.607
No. Because you agreed
to apartment sit

00:39.707 --> 00:41.642
and people my age
don't usually pay well.

00:41.742 --> 00:44.044
Picking ten albums
from your record collection

00:44.145 --> 00:45.713
does seem fair to me.

00:45.813 --> 00:48.316
Just not the Manilow, okay?

00:48.416 --> 00:50.318
Okay. Boomer.

00:51.752 --> 00:53.187
I guess I asked for that one.

00:53.287 --> 00:56.290
Okay, so we still have to go
over the living room plants.

00:56.390 --> 00:57.725
Wait.

00:57.825 --> 01:00.294
You didn't say your vacation
was someplace warm.

01:00.394 --> 01:01.962
My price just went up.
Jealousy tax.

01:02.062 --> 01:05.566
What? I always wear that shirt
whenever I visit...

01:06.467 --> 01:07.901
...Idaho.

01:08.001 --> 01:09.303
12 albums.

01:09.403 --> 01:10.638
Or your plants can slowly die

01:10.738 --> 01:12.273
along with
the rest of the planet.

01:14.275 --> 01:15.476
I'll let you think about it.

01:15.576 --> 01:16.677
Be back later.

01:16.777 --> 01:19.012
Oh, Libby.

01:22.116 --> 01:24.318
Hello?

01:24.418 --> 01:27.355
How did you get this number?

01:29.290 --> 01:31.492
Don't try to find me.

01:37.831 --> 01:39.767
Libby?

01:39.867 --> 01:41.269
Is that you?

02:38.526 --> 02:40.761
You know, this is the third time

02:40.861 --> 02:42.996
Kasie has sent us out
for a supply run.

02:43.096 --> 02:45.233
Yeah. She either needs
to stop throwing parties

02:45.333 --> 02:48.035
or we need to stop agreeing
to be her gophers.

02:49.237 --> 02:52.172
First it was Ducky's birthday,
then it was Susan in HR

02:52.273 --> 02:54.242
with a housewarming.
And then...

02:54.342 --> 02:56.076
now it's a-it's
a retirement party

02:56.176 --> 02:57.878
for a guy I don't even like.

02:57.978 --> 03:00.248
Oh, come on, everybody
likes the professor.

03:00.348 --> 03:01.682
Not everybody.

03:01.782 --> 03:03.584
He was my favorite
instructor at FLETC.

03:03.684 --> 03:06.754
Kind of a cross between Robin
Williams from <i>Dead Poets Society</i>

03:06.854 --> 03:08.489
and, uh, the professor
on <i>Gilligan's Island.</i>

03:08.589 --> 03:10.391
What? No way.

03:10.491 --> 03:12.260
More like the dude
from <i>Whiplash.</i>

03:13.193 --> 03:15.095
If the professor were
a pathological hard-ass,

03:15.195 --> 03:16.664
why would federal agents
from around the world

03:16.764 --> 03:17.931
come to his party?

03:18.031 --> 03:20.668
I don't know.
Maybe you should ask them.

03:25.339 --> 03:27.007
Can we help you?

03:28.942 --> 03:30.378
Yes.

03:30.478 --> 03:32.346
Where do you keep
your extra staples?

03:32.446 --> 03:35.716
Hey.
I don't.

03:36.817 --> 03:39.687
I've got them in my upper
right drawer, Agent Boone.

03:39.787 --> 03:41.822
Thanks, Jess.
Sorry about the invasion

03:41.922 --> 03:44.692
of privacy, but we were
given direct orders.

03:44.792 --> 03:46.360
Uh, by General Hines?

03:46.460 --> 03:49.663
Yes. We got here a day early
for the retirement party, and

03:49.763 --> 03:51.265
Kasie put us on decorating duty.

03:51.365 --> 03:54.101
Well, she's hard to say no to.
Yeah, tell us about it.

03:54.201 --> 03:56.236
Hey, look, it's the least we
can do for the professor--

03:56.337 --> 03:57.605
after all, his classes

03:57.705 --> 03:59.039
on threat response
have saved me more than once.

03:59.139 --> 04:01.241
Hey, he was the one
who suggested I switch

04:01.342 --> 04:05.045
from D.C. Homicide to NCIS.
The man changed my life.

04:05.145 --> 04:06.380
You're not the only one.

04:06.480 --> 04:07.715
Yeah, that's for sure.

04:07.815 --> 04:09.617
Listen to this.
Over the last 30 years,

04:09.717 --> 04:10.751
the professor has taught

04:10.851 --> 04:13.721
47,410 federal trainees

04:13.821 --> 04:18.058
and recertified
60,902 active personnel.

04:18.158 --> 04:20.728
That's, uh,
wildly specific, McGee.

04:20.828 --> 04:22.229
Kasie asked me
to crunch the numbers.

04:22.330 --> 04:23.931
She's giving a toast later,
and she knows

04:24.031 --> 04:25.933
the professor can be
a real stickler for details.

04:26.033 --> 04:28.369
He always used to say, "You
can't spell details without..."

04:28.469 --> 04:31.872
"Dotting the I's
and crossing the T's."

04:31.972 --> 04:34.742
Well, FLETC will, uh,
miss his mantras.

04:34.842 --> 04:37.411
I never thought the cockroach
would actually retire.

04:37.511 --> 04:38.946
The cockroach?
Mm-hmm.

04:39.046 --> 04:40.381
See? I'm not the only one
who hates the guy.

04:40.481 --> 04:43.150
No, that was his nickname
at the FBI. We loved him.

04:43.250 --> 04:44.818
Well, whatever you called him,
we, uh...

04:44.918 --> 04:46.454
we had lunch last week,
and he, uh,

04:46.554 --> 04:48.456
definitely seems happy
to be hanging up his spurs.

04:48.556 --> 04:50.891
Wow, happy? Like
Gibbs is in Alaska?

04:50.991 --> 04:53.160
Speaking of-- he
probably knew the professor.

04:53.260 --> 04:55.496
Any chance of Gibbs
showing up to the party?

04:55.596 --> 04:56.697
I doubt it.

04:56.797 --> 04:58.932
Although, you know what?
The professor

04:59.032 --> 05:00.934
did mention
that Gibbs and him went

05:01.034 --> 05:02.770
on a few fishing trips
back in the day.

05:02.870 --> 05:05.272
So you're saying
there's a chance?

05:05.373 --> 05:07.608
No, there's not.

05:07.708 --> 05:09.610
Because the party's off.

05:09.710 --> 05:11.779
I'm... I'm very sorry

05:11.879 --> 05:14.214
to have to report
Professor Dale Harding

05:14.314 --> 05:17.117
was found dead this morning
in his apartment.

05:21.489 --> 05:22.890
What happened, Director?

05:22.990 --> 05:25.826
The initial report suggests
that he died by suicide.

05:25.926 --> 05:28.562
Suicide? That-that...
that can't be right.

05:28.662 --> 05:30.931
No, it can't.

05:31.765 --> 05:34.167
Then I guess we got work to do.

05:46.313 --> 05:47.981
Well, this is awkward.

05:48.982 --> 05:51.251
But I think
you all forgot something.

05:51.351 --> 05:52.853
Like what?

06:01.662 --> 06:03.263
It was a joke.
I thought

06:03.363 --> 06:05.065
you were gonna take
the next elevator.

06:05.165 --> 06:07.468
You're obviously welcome
to any of our crime scenes.

06:07.568 --> 06:09.903
Your crime scenes?
Interesting.

06:10.003 --> 06:12.873
She's special agent in charge
of the entire Pacific Rim, Nick.

06:12.973 --> 06:14.942
I'd choose your next words
very carefully.

06:15.042 --> 06:16.477
No words is
also a choice.

06:16.577 --> 06:17.978
Very true. Amen.

06:18.078 --> 06:19.447
All right, all
I'm saying is that

06:19.547 --> 06:22.750
this is not the Pacific,
this is D.C., and, uh,

06:22.850 --> 06:26.086
we do things a certain way here.

06:26.186 --> 06:27.788
Mm.

06:27.888 --> 06:29.823
Does that way
include moving the body

06:29.923 --> 06:31.825
before you process the scene?

06:31.925 --> 06:33.427
Oh. Hi, guys.

06:33.527 --> 06:34.795
Uh, Jimmy,
what are you doing?

06:34.895 --> 06:37.064
Yeah. Who authorized you
to release the body?

06:37.164 --> 06:38.832
We did.

06:42.570 --> 06:44.505
Agents Callen and Hanna.

06:44.605 --> 06:46.373
Agent Tennant.

06:47.908 --> 06:50.444
McGee!
Oh, it's been a while.

06:51.479 --> 06:54.347
Yeah. What the hell
are you guys doing here?

06:55.248 --> 06:57.885
I guess it hasn't
been long enough.

07:09.262 --> 07:11.532
Still using the
old DSLRs, huh?

07:12.332 --> 07:15.969
Standard-issue equipment.
Unlike, uh, color-dye gloves.

07:16.069 --> 07:18.005
Well, you know,
they work the same as yours.

07:18.105 --> 07:19.707
Well, until the dye rubs off

07:19.807 --> 07:21.609
and contaminates
the evidence.

07:21.709 --> 07:23.410
Look, we're not trying to step
on anyone's toes coming here.

07:23.511 --> 07:25.412
We were in D.C.
for the professor's party.

07:25.513 --> 07:27.981
We heard the bad news
when we landed.

07:28.081 --> 07:29.883
We had to find out
if it was true.

07:29.983 --> 07:31.485
And was it?

07:31.585 --> 07:33.186
We never got to see the body.

07:33.286 --> 07:34.454
It was true.

07:34.555 --> 07:36.356
And it was not pretty.

07:36.456 --> 07:38.225
Single gunshot
under the chin.

07:38.325 --> 07:40.894
Fresh GSR,
consistent blood spatter.

07:40.994 --> 07:42.796
It was suicide.

07:42.896 --> 07:44.464
I had lunch with the professor
a few days ago,

07:44.565 --> 07:46.266
and he seemed fine.

07:46.366 --> 07:49.202
Talking big
about retirement plans.

07:49.302 --> 07:50.638
Like a trip to Cabo.

07:50.738 --> 07:52.405
He had a ticket to leave
at the end of the week.

07:52.506 --> 07:54.241
Yeah, suicide
doesn't make sense.

07:54.341 --> 07:56.143
Not for the cockroach.

07:56.243 --> 07:57.945
Your class called him that, too?

07:58.045 --> 07:59.412
Out of respect.

07:59.513 --> 08:01.649
You and Parker have high
opinions of primitive insects.

08:01.749 --> 08:05.318
They're survivors.
And so was Dale Harding.

08:05.418 --> 08:07.721
The man taught
incident preparedness

08:07.821 --> 08:10.891
and threat response, and one
of his many mantras was "Adapt

08:10.991 --> 08:12.192
and overcome."

08:12.292 --> 08:13.794
Well, I guess
he forgot his mantra.

08:13.894 --> 08:15.162
He didn't forget.

08:15.262 --> 08:17.130
He had to have had
a good reason.

08:17.230 --> 08:19.032
That means we're
missing something.

08:19.132 --> 08:20.400
Yeah, like a cell phone.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.570
Someone call
<i>The Guinness Book of Records.</i>

08:22.670 --> 08:24.004
I think we have
the most senior

08:24.104 --> 08:25.438
field agents
at a crime scene.

08:25.539 --> 08:27.374
Yeah, I heard
the NCIS Great Lakes office is

08:27.474 --> 08:29.042
on their way, too.

08:31.812 --> 08:33.380
I'm kidding.

08:33.480 --> 08:35.015
You, uh, said something
about a cell phone?

08:35.115 --> 08:38.151
Yes. We were talking
to the next door neighbor Libby.

08:38.251 --> 08:39.386
And she said she
heard the gunshot

08:39.486 --> 08:40.821
at 7:40 a.m.

08:40.921 --> 08:42.723
Said she knocked,
but no answer.

08:42.823 --> 08:44.958
Building manager unlocked
the door ten minutes later

08:45.058 --> 08:47.628
and they found the body.
Libby know the professor?

08:47.728 --> 08:49.930
Yeah. She was with him
moments before the gunshot.

08:50.030 --> 08:51.231
Said he was alone and cheerful

08:51.331 --> 08:52.966
when he got a call
on his cell phone.

08:53.901 --> 08:56.937
Except I didn't see
a cell phone here.

08:57.037 --> 08:58.438
Anyone else?

08:59.372 --> 09:00.641
Then where the hell is it?

09:00.741 --> 09:03.343
I might have an answer.
According to the access log,

09:03.443 --> 09:06.013
this computer was last used
at 7:45 a.m.

09:06.113 --> 09:07.948
That's five minutes
after the gunshot.

09:08.048 --> 09:10.050
Five minutes before
the body was found.

09:10.150 --> 09:12.686
Yeah, means someone else
was in this apartment.

09:15.222 --> 09:17.991
<i>Are you sure it was a suicide?</i>

09:18.091 --> 09:21.595
Because, rule number three:
always double-check.

09:21.695 --> 09:23.196
I did double-check,
and you don't have

09:23.296 --> 09:25.198
to quote Gibbs' rules to me.

09:25.298 --> 09:26.767
He and I go way back.

09:26.867 --> 09:29.269
Look, if there was somebody
else in that apartment,

09:29.369 --> 09:30.671
maybe they pulled
the trigger.

09:30.771 --> 09:32.673
Well, the evidence says suicide.

09:32.773 --> 09:34.441
Well, that is until
Jimmy says otherwise.

09:34.541 --> 09:35.542
You want to bet?

09:35.643 --> 09:36.877
No rules against that.

09:36.977 --> 09:38.612
Actually, there is.

09:40.480 --> 09:42.415
Number 15.
15? We're not dating.

09:42.515 --> 09:44.618
No, 15 is about lawyers. Oh.

09:44.718 --> 09:47.020
Okay, never mind. Look,
the point is that even if

09:47.120 --> 09:48.555
the professor
took his own life...
Which he did.

09:48.656 --> 09:50.624
...he could have been coerced.

09:50.724 --> 09:52.726
I'm guessing that has to do
with his last call.

09:52.826 --> 09:55.763
Phone records show a
blocked number at 7:38 a.m.

09:55.863 --> 09:58.666
And two minutes later
the professor shot himself. Exactly.

09:58.766 --> 10:01.134
We need to find out
what was said on that call.

10:01.234 --> 10:03.603
And who said it.
Well, that might be a problem.

10:03.704 --> 10:05.505
The blocked number was bounced
through a signal relay

10:05.605 --> 10:07.574
and the professor's missing cell
has been turned off.

10:07.675 --> 10:09.810
No back trace, no GPS.

10:09.910 --> 10:12.646
It's okay. We will
adapt and overcome,

10:12.746 --> 10:14.648
just like
the professor used to say.

10:14.748 --> 10:16.116
I think we owe that to him.

10:16.216 --> 10:18.919
I think that is something
that we can all agree on.

10:19.019 --> 10:21.922
Yeah, the man tried
to kick me out of FLETC, but...

10:24.324 --> 10:26.026
...he does deserve justice.

10:32.900 --> 10:35.302
Oh, hey, Tim.
Hey, Jimmy.

10:35.402 --> 10:36.469
You alone?

10:36.569 --> 10:38.005
Yeah. Why, what's wrong?

10:38.105 --> 10:40.107
Ah, nothing, aside
from the fact that you're alone.

10:40.207 --> 10:42.242
There are so many fresh faces
in the building,

10:42.342 --> 10:44.311
I was kind of hoping that one
of 'em might want to stop by.

10:44.411 --> 10:47.748
Or you could talk to my face
since it's already here.

10:47.848 --> 10:50.417
And it is a lovely face, Tim,
but it can't invite me

10:50.517 --> 10:51.752
to Hawai'i or Los Angeles.

10:51.852 --> 10:53.987
I've never been
to either NCIS office.

10:54.087 --> 10:56.356
Yeah, me, neither.
Least not since OSP moved

10:56.456 --> 10:57.691
into that old
Mexican restaurant.

10:57.791 --> 10:59.392
I thought
it was a Spanish mission.

10:59.492 --> 11:00.560
I don't know.

11:00.660 --> 11:01.762
What's with the towel?

11:01.862 --> 11:03.363
Oh, right.
This is a courtesy

11:03.463 --> 11:05.532
to those of you
who knew Dale Harding.

11:05.632 --> 11:08.668
When fired into a skull,
a small-caliber bullet

11:08.769 --> 11:10.237
has a tendency
to ricochet around,

11:10.337 --> 11:12.806
shattering the facial bones.
It's not a good look.

11:12.906 --> 11:14.241
You confirmed it was a suicide?

11:14.341 --> 11:17.210
Agent Callen was right.
This man took his own life.

11:17.310 --> 11:18.445
Question is why.

11:18.545 --> 11:19.847
That's not the only question.

11:19.947 --> 11:22.582
I mean, aside from
the obvious gunshot to the head,

11:22.682 --> 11:24.551
take a look
at the rest of his body.

11:24.651 --> 11:26.386
Some old
bullet wounds.

11:26.486 --> 11:28.989
Yeah, and burns and cuts.

11:29.089 --> 11:31.859
Based on the tissue buildup,
I'd say that these are all

11:31.959 --> 11:33.360
decades old.

11:33.460 --> 11:35.562
Before he taught at FLETC?

11:35.662 --> 11:37.197
He always talked
about his time in the Marines.

11:37.297 --> 11:39.699
As a gunnery sergeant, yes.
Yeah, maybe he saw action.

11:39.800 --> 11:42.502
That's what I thought
at first, as well.

11:42.602 --> 11:44.671
But according to
his service records

11:44.772 --> 11:48.608
and his medical records,
Dale Harding was never wounded.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.110
So where'd the scars come from?

11:50.210 --> 11:52.545
Whatever happened
in this man's past,

11:52.645 --> 11:55.215
he kept it secret.

11:57.217 --> 11:59.419
I don't know about
these cupcakes, Kasie.

11:59.519 --> 12:00.453
Doesn't feel right.

12:00.553 --> 12:01.855
Someone has to eat them.

12:01.955 --> 12:03.590
Otherwise, they go to waste.

12:03.690 --> 12:06.559
Maybe if we just
take the toppers off?

12:06.659 --> 12:08.428
No. That wouldn't feel right,

12:08.528 --> 12:11.264
like we were giving up
on the professor.

12:11.364 --> 12:12.833
No, he was a noble man

12:12.933 --> 12:14.868
and would not have done
something so drastic

12:14.968 --> 12:17.070
unless someone made him do it.

12:17.170 --> 12:20.207
You have proof of that, right?
No.

12:20.307 --> 12:21.775
Whoever entered the apartment

12:21.875 --> 12:23.476
and used the professor's
computer knew how

12:23.576 --> 12:24.945
to cover their tracks.

12:25.045 --> 12:28.715
Hmm. Well... they knew
what they were doing.

12:28.816 --> 12:30.383
Wait a minute.

12:30.483 --> 12:33.653
This computer wasn't just
used after he shot himself.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.488
It was also used before.

12:35.588 --> 12:37.124
How long before?

12:37.224 --> 12:39.092
Less than a minute.

12:39.192 --> 12:41.194
It looks like
the professor typed something

12:41.294 --> 12:42.562
in a text program.

12:42.662 --> 12:44.564
Maybe it was a suicide note.

12:44.664 --> 12:47.935
Uh, if it was,
it was a short one.

12:48.035 --> 12:52.539
The professor's last words were
"extra homework"?

12:52.639 --> 12:54.374
That is every student's
worst nightmare.

12:54.474 --> 12:56.243
It must mean something, right?

12:56.343 --> 12:58.678
He had to have known
we were gonna find it.

13:00.080 --> 13:02.883
I think there's something
on here the professor

13:02.983 --> 13:04.417
didn't want
us to find.

13:04.517 --> 13:05.752
These are
government files.

13:05.853 --> 13:07.087
How can you tell?

13:07.187 --> 13:08.889
Each agency
has their own

13:08.989 --> 13:10.657
unique file-naming system.

13:10.757 --> 13:13.160
See how these all have
the same DOD suffix?

13:13.260 --> 13:14.727
Department of Defense.

13:14.828 --> 13:15.963
But what's the big deal?
I mean,

13:16.063 --> 13:17.530
the professor was
a government employee.

13:17.630 --> 13:20.300
They all also have
the same prefix:

13:20.400 --> 13:22.635
T.S.S.C.I.

13:22.735 --> 13:26.840
Top secret sensitive
compartmented information.

13:26.940 --> 13:28.842
A civilian FLETC instructor

13:28.942 --> 13:30.978
shouldn't have these files
on his personal computer.

13:31.078 --> 13:33.213
He shouldn't have them at all.

13:33.313 --> 13:34.982
So how'd he get them?

13:36.083 --> 13:38.118
I have no idea because

13:38.218 --> 13:40.720
the last thing the professor did
before he killed himself

13:40.820 --> 13:43.891
was delete these files
to hide the evidence.

13:43.991 --> 13:48.395
Well, not exactly the actions...

13:48.495 --> 13:50.363
of a noble man.

13:59.272 --> 14:01.408
Yes.
We are looking into it,

14:01.508 --> 14:02.943
I assure you.

14:03.043 --> 14:04.711
Yes, I will. Thank you.

14:05.512 --> 14:08.648
Well, that was the head
of cybersecurity at DoD.

14:08.748 --> 14:11.919
Not only did Dale Harding not
have clearance for those files,

14:12.019 --> 14:13.486
the Pentagon didn't even know

14:13.586 --> 14:15.288
that the intel was missing
from their servers.

14:15.388 --> 14:16.823
So it was stolen?

14:16.924 --> 14:18.325
What was in the files?

14:18.425 --> 14:20.060
DoD claims that's need-to-know.

14:20.160 --> 14:21.694
I agree.
We need to know.

14:21.794 --> 14:23.630
Well, right now,
they seem more concerned

14:23.730 --> 14:25.665
with why a humble
FLETC instructor

14:25.765 --> 14:27.734
hacked their system.
Good question.

14:27.834 --> 14:29.136
Yeah, for them and for us.

14:29.236 --> 14:30.870
We don't know
what the professor was planning

14:30.971 --> 14:32.405
to do with that intel.

14:32.505 --> 14:34.774
Well, clearly nothing good.
He committed treason.

14:34.874 --> 14:37.577
Then shot himself, so maybe
he had a change of heart.

14:37.677 --> 14:39.046
Look, I don't want to believe

14:39.146 --> 14:40.647
that the man was a criminal
any more than you,

14:40.747 --> 14:42.449
but the evidence
is the evidence.

14:42.549 --> 14:44.617
And so we follow the evidence
till we find the truth.

14:44.717 --> 14:46.519
Something I expect to
happen sooner than later,

14:46.619 --> 14:47.988
considering how
many resources

14:48.088 --> 14:50.457
NCIS currently has
dedicated to this case.

14:50.557 --> 14:53.593
Multiple senior field agents
from multiple field offices.

14:53.693 --> 14:55.262
All being put
to good use, Director.

14:55.362 --> 14:56.796
I would certainly hope so.

14:56.896 --> 14:59.599
If the professor
stole valuable intel,

14:59.699 --> 15:01.668
I doubt he did it
just for kicks.

15:01.768 --> 15:03.570
Or maybe he had a buyer.
I don't know.

15:03.670 --> 15:04.904
I've got agents looking

15:05.005 --> 15:06.974
into every corner
of Dale Harding's life,

15:07.074 --> 15:09.176
starting with where
he was currently stationed.

15:09.276 --> 15:11.778
FLETC's Maryland campus.

15:11.878 --> 15:15.048
You sent NCIS's
best and brightest

15:15.148 --> 15:16.316
back to school?

15:16.416 --> 15:18.551
Never too late
to learn new things.

15:19.852 --> 15:21.955
This is a Blue Line
Metro train. Next stop,

15:22.055 --> 15:25.292
Foggy Bottom-GWU Kennedy Center.

15:25.392 --> 15:27.027
Stand clear of the door, please.

15:35.302 --> 15:37.470
Get the doors open!

15:40.507 --> 15:42.509
Okay.

15:42.609 --> 15:45.912
Who can tell me how to stop
a public panic such as this?

15:46.013 --> 15:48.015
You can't.

15:51.051 --> 15:53.553
That's, uh... that's correct.

15:53.653 --> 15:56.223
Which begs the question, in
the event of a public threat,

15:56.323 --> 15:57.490
what is our best
course of action

15:57.590 --> 15:59.026
as trained federal agents?

15:59.126 --> 16:00.960
Identify the source
of the threat.

16:01.061 --> 16:02.895
And neutralize the threat.

16:02.996 --> 16:04.797
Uh, exactly.

16:04.897 --> 16:07.600
Wh-Which is why we
determine if the gas is

16:07.700 --> 16:09.936
a chemical attack or...

16:10.037 --> 16:13.306
Chemical attack, or...

16:15.042 --> 16:18.611
...some little skater kid's
harmless smoke bomb, huh?

16:18.711 --> 16:21.281
Class is concluded for
today. Thanks, folks.

16:21.381 --> 16:24.217
Um, actually, we have three more
hours of simulator training.

16:24.317 --> 16:25.918
Yeah, that's not
gonna happen.

16:26.019 --> 16:27.054
NCIS.

16:27.154 --> 16:29.322
And this is not a drill.

16:30.657 --> 16:33.560
We need access
to Dale Harding's office.

16:34.361 --> 16:38.265
Notice how each agent focuses on
a separate quadrant of the room.

16:38.365 --> 16:40.500
Protects evidence
and maximizes resources.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.202
It's textbook police work.

16:42.302 --> 16:43.670
Show's over, folks.

16:43.770 --> 16:45.238
Yeah.

16:45.338 --> 16:48.141
So attentive. Maybe we should
let 'em watch, huh?

16:48.241 --> 16:49.509
We are worth studying.

16:49.609 --> 16:52.379
Yeah, some of us
more than others.

16:53.480 --> 16:56.616
What is this?

16:56.716 --> 16:58.918
Oh, wow. Check it out.

16:59.018 --> 17:02.622
The professor kept a scrapbook
of his former students. Hmm.

17:02.722 --> 17:05.225
Uh, promotions, news clippings.

17:05.325 --> 17:06.459
Yeah? Am I in there?

17:06.559 --> 17:09.096
No.

17:09.196 --> 17:11.431
But I am.

17:13.600 --> 17:15.602
Thought you and the
professor didn't get along.

17:15.702 --> 17:17.337
Oh, yeah.
No, he hated me.

17:17.437 --> 17:19.506
No, the professor
didn't hate anybody,

17:19.606 --> 17:21.241
especially not his students.

17:21.341 --> 17:24.177
Then why did he pull me aside
during the last week of training

17:24.277 --> 17:25.578
and tell me to quit?

17:25.678 --> 17:27.147
Those were his
exact words?

17:27.247 --> 17:29.015
No. His exact words were,

17:29.116 --> 17:31.351
"You are a lone wolf,
not a team player."

17:31.451 --> 17:32.885
Was he wrong?

17:32.985 --> 17:34.921
My dad used to say
after practice,

17:35.021 --> 17:36.989
"If the coach is yelling,
it's a good thing."

17:37.090 --> 17:38.358
Yeah, it means he cares.

17:38.458 --> 17:40.227
It's when
the coach stops riding you.

17:40.327 --> 17:41.894
Then you should be worried.

17:43.663 --> 17:45.865
Look at this.

17:45.965 --> 17:48.501
Haven't seen one of these
in a minute.

17:48.601 --> 17:50.370
Wow.
The guy who hacks the Pentagon

17:50.470 --> 17:52.038
still keeps floppy disks?

17:53.039 --> 17:54.307
Complicated man.

17:54.407 --> 17:56.243
More complicated than we knew.

17:57.210 --> 18:00.680
Either of you ever know
the professor to miss a class?

18:01.714 --> 18:03.216
Unfortunately, no.

18:03.316 --> 18:05.718
No, me, neither.
But according to this schedule,

18:05.818 --> 18:07.387
a substitute teacher
was scheduled

18:07.487 --> 18:09.322
to teach his
final class.

18:09.422 --> 18:11.658
Who gets a sub
on their last day?

18:11.758 --> 18:14.427
Better question: why?

18:48.795 --> 18:51.431
That evasive maneuvering was

18:51.531 --> 18:53.566
inspired, Agent Tennant.

18:53.666 --> 18:56.269
And, Agent Knight,
that pit technique--

18:56.369 --> 18:58.070
it's a beautiful thing.

18:58.171 --> 18:59.739
Never saw it coming.

19:01.341 --> 19:02.709
All right.

19:02.809 --> 19:04.711
Burn that demonstration
into your retinas,

19:04.811 --> 19:06.179
my little ducklings.

19:06.279 --> 19:09.582
The road is a battlefield.
You want to survive?

19:09.682 --> 19:13.720
Then you have
to play offense and defense.

19:14.454 --> 19:17.156
Write it down.

19:19.759 --> 19:21.428
Thanks for the practice,
Instructor Ford.

19:21.528 --> 19:23.396
Oh, please, call me Greta.

19:23.496 --> 19:27.534
And my two favorite students
can audit my class anytime.

19:27.634 --> 19:29.636
Except we're not
really here to drive.

19:29.736 --> 19:32.171
You're here about Dale Harding.

19:33.172 --> 19:36.976
All right, everybody back to
the garage for video analysis.

19:37.076 --> 19:38.678
Double time.

19:38.778 --> 19:41.914
Don't make me say it twice!
Oh, yes, sir. Yes, ma'am.

19:44.517 --> 19:47.787
I was so sad to hear
what happened to the professor.

19:47.887 --> 19:49.456
Ask me, it doesn't
make any sense.

19:49.556 --> 19:52.359
Neither does the fact that
you subbed his class yesterday.

19:52.459 --> 19:53.793
His last class.

19:53.893 --> 19:55.962
I was just as shocked as anyone.

19:56.062 --> 19:58.064
Dale and I are like
oil and water

19:58.164 --> 20:00.733
when it comes
to teaching styles.

20:00.833 --> 20:02.735
But he begged me to cover
for him at the last second.

20:02.835 --> 20:05.104
What could I do?
Did he give a reason?

20:05.204 --> 20:07.374
Sure.
Can't say as I blamed him.

20:07.474 --> 20:09.309
Said he wanted

20:09.409 --> 20:13.380
to move up his post-retirement
vacation a few days.

20:13.480 --> 20:14.481
His trip to Cabo.

20:14.581 --> 20:15.615
Cabo?

20:15.715 --> 20:17.817
No, he was going to Hawai'i.

20:17.917 --> 20:19.185
Hawai'i?

20:20.253 --> 20:21.354
You sure about that?

20:21.454 --> 20:23.155
My hearing ain't that bad.

20:23.256 --> 20:25.525
Dale said he was
meeting an old friend.

20:27.560 --> 20:30.129
I have everything
from Dale's FLETC office.

20:30.229 --> 20:32.198
I understand.

20:32.299 --> 20:35.167
Yes. Thank you.

20:35.268 --> 20:37.704
I'm sorry. Who are you?

20:37.804 --> 20:39.806
Agent Sam Hanna.

20:41.140 --> 20:42.875
Los Angeles?

20:44.411 --> 20:46.679
OSP?

20:46.779 --> 20:49.582
Oh, right.
The agents that didn't RSVP

20:49.682 --> 20:52.118
for the retirement party
but showed up anyway.

20:52.218 --> 20:55.688
That's us. I'm sorry about that.
I was...

20:55.788 --> 20:57.724
Office, evidence.
Yes, I got it.

20:57.824 --> 20:59.426
What I don't get is why

20:59.526 --> 21:02.362
the professor changed
his vacation plans two days ago,

21:02.462 --> 21:04.931
'cause that was the airline
I was talking to.

21:05.031 --> 21:06.699
He switched from Cabo
to Hawai'i.

21:06.799 --> 21:08.200
Not only that.

21:08.301 --> 21:10.803
He changed his ticket
to leave this morning.

21:10.903 --> 21:13.473
His retirement party was
supposed to be today, right?

21:13.573 --> 21:14.807
Yes, I know.

21:14.907 --> 21:16.309
What I didn't know is

21:16.409 --> 21:18.411
the guest of honor was
planning on missing it.

21:18.511 --> 21:20.246
That is pretty cold.

21:20.347 --> 21:23.149
It's also pretty strange.
It's not like him.

21:23.249 --> 21:25.418
Not to mention, there was
nothing on his computer

21:25.518 --> 21:29.322
or in his apartment about
any old friend in Hawai'i.

21:29.422 --> 21:31.190
Well, he could have made it up.

21:32.024 --> 21:34.561
Just an excuse to skip town
with the stolen files.

21:34.661 --> 21:36.095
And do what with them?

21:36.195 --> 21:39.065
Sell them,
pad his retirement account.

21:39.165 --> 21:40.867
Until someone
caught him here first.

21:40.967 --> 21:42.969
You really think
the professor was a crook?

21:43.069 --> 21:45.137
You don't?
We don't know

21:45.237 --> 21:47.273
that he's the one
that stole those files.

21:47.374 --> 21:50.009
You're a positive thinker.
I respect that.

21:56.082 --> 21:58.618
Looks like
my positive thinking paid off.

21:58.718 --> 22:01.621
This is a security alert
from DoD.

22:01.721 --> 22:05.592
They no longer think
Dale Harding was the hacker.

22:05.692 --> 22:08.628
That's good news. Hmm.

22:08.728 --> 22:12.164
No, it's not.
Because they have a new suspect.

22:20.673 --> 22:22.609
Weird.

22:22.709 --> 22:23.976
Having trouble, McGee?

22:24.076 --> 22:25.945
Yeah. No, my scan isn't working.

22:26.045 --> 22:27.547
I have no idea why.

22:27.647 --> 22:28.948
We do.

22:29.048 --> 22:30.917
You're under arrest for treason.

22:31.851 --> 22:34.086
Is this some kind of joke?

22:45.331 --> 22:48.568
I can't believe this. You guys
are accusing me of treason?

22:48.668 --> 22:50.737
In my own house?
It is nothing personal.

22:50.837 --> 22:53.440
Really? Then why aren't we doing
this in the conference room?

22:53.540 --> 22:54.741
We didn't know where that was.

22:54.841 --> 22:56.175
You didn't know
where this room was.

22:56.275 --> 22:57.343
I had to show you.

22:57.444 --> 22:58.911
And we appreciate
your cooperation.

22:59.011 --> 23:01.781
But we still need an explanation
for a few things.

23:08.455 --> 23:10.690
Got to say, Director,
this feels wrong.

23:10.790 --> 23:13.860
Why is there an outside team
in our interrogation room?

23:13.960 --> 23:16.929
Because it's better
than the alternative.
Which is?

23:17.029 --> 23:19.799
Letting DoD question McGee
in their interrogation room.

23:19.899 --> 23:22.535
They traced the server hack
back to his credentials.

23:22.635 --> 23:23.770
And they're out for blood.

23:23.870 --> 23:25.638
And you agreed
to give it to 'em?

23:25.738 --> 23:29.241
No. I agreed to have Agent McGee
questioned by a neutral party.

23:29.341 --> 23:30.810
Neutral?
It's two against one in there.

23:30.910 --> 23:32.912
And the one on the right is,
like, 300 pounds of muscle.

23:33.012 --> 23:35.147
McGEE:
This would appear my login data

23:35.247 --> 23:36.616
was used to create a back door

23:36.716 --> 23:38.818
and launch a blind SQL injection
that allowed

23:38.918 --> 23:39.952
top secret files

23:40.052 --> 23:41.053
to be removed undetected.

23:41.153 --> 23:42.188
That's smart.

23:42.288 --> 23:43.790
It's exactly what I would do.

23:44.624 --> 23:45.725
Maybe you did do it.

23:45.825 --> 23:47.827
You don't really believe that.

23:47.927 --> 23:49.228
No.

23:49.328 --> 23:50.863
We don't.

23:50.963 --> 23:52.331
But DoD does.

23:52.431 --> 23:53.866
Help us help you.

23:53.966 --> 23:55.802
Who else has access
to your login info?

23:55.902 --> 23:57.336
Nobody.
It was obviously stolen.

23:57.436 --> 23:58.738
You expect us
to believe

23:58.838 --> 24:00.372
the computer guy
lost his password?

24:00.473 --> 24:02.842
Says the car guy
who once lost his favorite car.

24:02.942 --> 24:04.877
Charlene, right?

24:05.778 --> 24:07.146
He knows the name of my car.

24:07.246 --> 24:09.315
It's impressive.

24:09.415 --> 24:10.717
Yeah, and Agent Callen,
didn't you get

24:10.817 --> 24:13.419
your entire identity
stolen last year?

24:15.755 --> 24:18.991
So let's not get too judgy
about lost login info.

24:19.091 --> 24:20.259
Point taken.

24:20.359 --> 24:21.427
Thank you.

24:21.528 --> 24:22.895
But we still need an explanation

24:22.995 --> 24:24.831
for how someone
got access to your info.

24:24.931 --> 24:27.399
No, I know, especially
since I use two-factor

24:27.500 --> 24:28.901
security on my laptop

24:29.001 --> 24:31.704
and a six-digit alphanumeric
unlock code on my...

24:33.105 --> 24:34.941
...on my phone.

24:35.041 --> 24:37.009
Everything okay?

24:37.109 --> 24:38.511
No.

24:38.611 --> 24:40.713
I had lunch with the
professor a few days ago.

24:40.813 --> 24:43.482
Got up to use the restroom.
I left my phone on the table.

24:43.583 --> 24:45.384
Did he have your six-digit code?

24:45.484 --> 24:47.453
No, he didn't need to.
I unlocked it

24:47.554 --> 24:49.922
when he asked
to see photos of my kids.

24:51.791 --> 24:53.492
He wasn't looking
at your photos.

24:53.593 --> 24:56.996
No, he was looking
at my login data.

25:00.199 --> 25:01.934
This just keeps getting worse.

25:02.034 --> 25:04.336
Not only did
the professor commit treason,

25:04.436 --> 25:06.405
he exploited a former student
to do it.

25:06.505 --> 25:08.174
Afraid I got more bad news.

25:08.274 --> 25:09.642
Are you gonna tell me

25:09.742 --> 25:11.410
the professor was actually
a Cylon this whole time?

25:11.510 --> 25:12.945
No, but I still
haven't found any sign

25:13.045 --> 25:15.481
of a missing cell phone
or the person who took it.

25:15.582 --> 25:17.016
There's nothing
in this apartment.

25:17.116 --> 25:18.317
Frak!

25:18.417 --> 25:20.119
Yeah, so say we all.

25:20.219 --> 25:21.921
Oh, a fellow <i>Battlestar</i> fan?

25:22.021 --> 25:24.323
Well, I knew I liked you better
than Agent Hanna.

25:24.423 --> 25:26.092
He's not a fan of sci-fi?

25:26.192 --> 25:28.260
He's not a fan of subtlety.

25:28.360 --> 25:30.362
I show him one email from DoD

25:30.462 --> 25:32.364
and he storms out of here
and arrests McGee,

25:32.464 --> 25:34.166
no questions asked.

25:34.266 --> 25:36.235
I'm pretty sure
a lot of questions were asked.

25:36.335 --> 25:37.570
It was an interrogation.

25:37.670 --> 25:40.006
Of a fellow agent?

25:40.106 --> 25:42.008
Look, Agent Hanna
was doing his job.

25:42.108 --> 25:44.210
Well, he can do it
someplace else,

25:44.310 --> 25:46.012
because Sam Hanna is not allowed

25:46.112 --> 25:48.247
to step foot
in this lab ever again.

25:48.347 --> 25:49.982
That's gonna be a problem.

25:53.653 --> 25:54.887
Let me call you back.

25:54.987 --> 25:57.724
Copy.

25:57.824 --> 25:59.058
Agent Hanna.

25:59.158 --> 26:01.260
Are you here to apologize
for arresting McGee?

26:01.360 --> 26:03.930
No. Because I didn't.

26:04.030 --> 26:06.132
But if it helps,
I never actually thought

26:06.232 --> 26:07.533
McGee was a criminal.

26:07.634 --> 26:09.669
It helps. A little.

26:09.769 --> 26:11.738
Mainly 'cause I am dying

26:11.838 --> 26:15.207
to show someone what I found
on the professor's floppy disks.

26:15.307 --> 26:17.376
Other than a copy
of the original <i>Doom?</i>

26:17.476 --> 26:20.012
Oh, actually, I prefer
O.G. <i>Oregon Trail.</i>

26:20.112 --> 26:23.082
But you are right.
All of the files on these disks

26:23.182 --> 26:25.284
are decades old, except

26:25.384 --> 26:27.119
one text file

26:27.219 --> 26:28.955
that was created last week.

26:30.957 --> 26:32.659
Extra homework.

26:32.759 --> 26:35.094
The same words the professor
typed before he died.

26:35.194 --> 26:37.163
Which means he wanted us
to find this disk.

26:37.263 --> 26:39.331
Yes. It is like
<i>The Da Vinci Code.</i>

26:39.431 --> 26:43.135
A clue trail he knew we'd follow
in the event of his death.

26:43.235 --> 26:44.536
So what does it mean?

26:44.637 --> 26:47.339
Well, that's the problem.

26:47.439 --> 26:49.709
I have no idea.

26:49.809 --> 26:52.111
Because there's nothing else
on this disk.

26:52.211 --> 26:54.480
How about in it?

26:54.580 --> 26:56.082
What do you mean?

26:56.182 --> 26:58.050
Well, back in the days,
in homeroom, I had a girl--

26:58.150 --> 27:00.720
she tried hitting on me
using a floppy disk.

27:01.620 --> 27:03.555
Heather Richardson.

27:03.656 --> 27:05.792
How did that work?
Eh, it didn't.

27:05.892 --> 27:07.894
She wasn't my type.
No. I mean,

27:07.994 --> 27:10.196
how did she use floppy disks
to hit on you?

27:10.296 --> 27:14.233
Oh, she, uh, pulled them apart
and hid love notes inside.

27:14.333 --> 27:16.568
Huh.

27:22.074 --> 27:24.543
Oh...

27:24.643 --> 27:27.680
Heather Richardson is a genius.

27:29.115 --> 27:31.283
That's exactly why
she wasn't my type.

27:31.383 --> 27:32.819
Okay.

27:32.919 --> 27:35.354
"The answer is in the files."

27:35.454 --> 27:37.857
Ah. That doesn't make sense.

27:37.957 --> 27:40.592
The professor deleted
all the stolen files.

27:40.693 --> 27:42.729
Right. Unless he made a copy.

27:42.829 --> 27:46.098
A copy he hid someplace safe.

27:46.198 --> 27:51.203
Is it just me, or does that
fireplace look very familiar?

27:53.072 --> 27:55.574
It's just you.

28:00.713 --> 28:03.015
The famous Gibbs cabin.

28:03.115 --> 28:06.953
I can't believe you guys
have his fireplaces memorized.

28:07.053 --> 28:09.956
Hard not to.
It's kind of his thing.

28:10.857 --> 28:12.424
Looks like, uh,

28:12.524 --> 28:13.960
nobody's been here in a while.

28:14.060 --> 28:16.428
Mm. Well, the professor
knew that Gibbs was gone.

28:16.528 --> 28:19.398
A deserted cabin is a perfect
place to hide stolen data.

28:19.498 --> 28:22.735
Yeah, data that the professor
wanted us to find.

28:22.835 --> 28:25.237
Well, so maybe
he did have good intentions.

28:26.572 --> 28:28.074
Who else knew about this place?

28:28.174 --> 28:30.242
Short list.

28:33.712 --> 28:35.547
You good?

28:35.647 --> 28:37.149
I thought I, uh...

28:41.620 --> 28:43.823
Think Gibbs came back from
Alaska and doesn't know it's us?

28:43.923 --> 28:46.826
If it was Gibbs shooting at us,
we'd be dead right now.

28:55.935 --> 28:57.203
You think we hit him?

28:57.303 --> 28:59.305
I don't know about you,
but I did.

29:12.751 --> 29:15.221
Yeah, we got blood.

29:15.321 --> 29:18.190
Think you hit him.

29:18.290 --> 29:20.126
Think we both did.

29:23.863 --> 29:26.799
I count at least three hits,
with one to the chest.

29:26.899 --> 29:28.801
He should be dead.

29:28.901 --> 29:31.137
Why isn't he?

29:32.104 --> 29:33.806
Because of this.

29:33.906 --> 29:35.574
His phone saved his life.

29:35.674 --> 29:37.709
Well, not for long.

29:37.810 --> 29:40.212
He's wounded
and he's on foot.

29:44.483 --> 29:46.886
Well, he's not on foot anymore.

29:46.986 --> 29:48.687
I'm gonna need roadblocks
in every direction

29:48.787 --> 29:50.289
in and out of Brossard County.

29:50.389 --> 29:54.060
Suspect is wounded, armed
and likely on a motorcycle.

29:55.261 --> 29:57.263
Appreciate that, Sheriff. Thanks.

29:57.363 --> 29:59.098
Knight and Tennant
are leading the search?

29:59.198 --> 30:01.901
Yeah. Agent, uh, Boone
is on his way

30:02.001 --> 30:03.870
to coordinate
with county police now,

30:03.970 --> 30:05.537
but so far, nothing.

30:05.637 --> 30:06.772
And the professor's
hidden files?

30:06.873 --> 30:08.240
Well, Torres searched the cabin.

30:08.340 --> 30:11.978
Looks like our mystery shooter
beat us to 'em.

30:12.078 --> 30:13.712
So, where you, uh,
where you headed?

30:13.812 --> 30:15.814
Malibu.
Kasie got a hit on bank records.

30:15.915 --> 30:17.850
Turns out the, uh,
professor was receiving

30:17.950 --> 30:19.651
anonymous wire transfers

30:19.751 --> 30:21.087
from a Western Union
along the PCH.

30:21.187 --> 30:22.989
Payment for the stolen files?

30:23.089 --> 30:25.491
Well, that's what Sam and I
are gonna try and find out.

30:25.591 --> 30:27.326
I'll keep you updated.
Same here.

30:27.426 --> 30:29.361
Yup.
Right.

30:30.129 --> 30:33.232
Did... did Agent Callen tell you
about the wire transfers?

30:33.332 --> 30:34.867
Yeah.
You ran up here for nothing.

30:34.967 --> 30:37.669
I didn't run for that.
I ran for this.

30:40.239 --> 30:41.974
Our mystery shooter's
cell phone.

30:42.074 --> 30:44.944
He's the one that left it
behind, but it's not his.

30:45.044 --> 30:47.546
I was able to access
the SSD memory.

30:47.646 --> 30:48.847
Well, who does it belong to?

30:48.948 --> 30:50.416
The professor.

30:50.516 --> 30:52.484
It's the phone that was stolen
from the crime scene.

30:52.584 --> 30:54.921
Our mystery shooter was the one
who was at the apartment.

30:55.021 --> 30:56.889
And we might have a name.
Turns out

30:56.989 --> 30:58.925
the professor used
an app to record

30:59.025 --> 31:01.660
all his calls,
including his last one.

31:01.760 --> 31:03.963
I'm trying to
repair the damaged

31:04.063 --> 31:06.065
audio file, but it sounds like

31:06.165 --> 31:08.800
the caller identifies himself.

31:08.901 --> 31:10.369
Hello, Professor.

31:10.469 --> 31:11.737
This is Simon Williams.

31:11.837 --> 31:15.041
Wait a second.
Did he say Simon Williams?

31:15.141 --> 31:18.410
I think so. I haven't run
the name through the system yet.

31:18.510 --> 31:19.912
There's no need to.

31:20.012 --> 31:22.014
He's on our wall.

31:35.527 --> 31:37.229
Hello, Professor.

31:37.329 --> 31:39.565
This is Simon Williams.
You remember.

31:39.665 --> 31:41.067
How did you get this number?

31:41.167 --> 31:42.234
You stole those files

31:42.334 --> 31:43.602
to keep them from me.

31:43.702 --> 31:46.138
But I have ways
of getting them from you.

31:46.238 --> 31:47.839
Don't try to find me.

31:47.940 --> 31:49.175
Too late.

31:49.275 --> 31:50.709
We know what happens next.

31:50.809 --> 31:52.811
Simon showed up
to make good on his threat.

31:52.911 --> 31:54.813
And rather than risk
being taken alive,

31:54.913 --> 31:56.949
the professor deleted
those files,

31:57.049 --> 31:58.517
took his own life.

31:58.617 --> 32:00.819
So what was in those files
that was worth dying for?

32:00.919 --> 32:02.521
DoD still won't say.

32:02.621 --> 32:04.490
Sounds to me like
they're keeping secrets.

32:04.590 --> 32:05.992
Yeah, secrets the
professor was trying

32:06.092 --> 32:07.693
to protect from Simon Williams.

32:07.793 --> 32:09.028
Didn't work.

32:09.128 --> 32:10.762
There's a reason
he's on our Most Wanted wall.

32:10.862 --> 32:13.132
Simon Williams
is on everyone's wall.

32:13.865 --> 32:16.502
He's a rogue operative
wanted for everything

32:16.602 --> 32:19.138
from espionage
to murder for hire.

32:19.238 --> 32:21.840
Committing crimes all over
the world going back 30 years.

32:21.940 --> 32:24.776
I guess career criminals
don't have a retirement age.

32:24.876 --> 32:28.580
Why retire? No one's ever
come close to catching the guy.

32:28.680 --> 32:32.118
Until now. We wounded him
outside of Gibbs' cabin.

32:32.218 --> 32:33.419
Tennant, Knight and Boone

32:33.519 --> 32:35.421
are currently
heading the manhunt

32:35.521 --> 32:37.923
with the Brossard
County sheriff. Good.

32:38.024 --> 32:39.425
But none of this explains

32:39.525 --> 32:41.827
the professor's involvement
in the first place.

32:41.927 --> 32:44.463
What's the connection
between a wanted hit man

32:44.563 --> 32:45.864
and a FLETC instructor?

32:45.964 --> 32:47.766
They knew each other.

32:47.866 --> 32:51.870
30 years ago, Simon Williams
was a FLETC trainee.

32:51.970 --> 32:54.306
He was a federal agent?
Never made it that far.

32:54.406 --> 32:56.275
The professor cut him
from the program.

32:56.375 --> 32:58.010
Did the professor give a reason?

32:58.110 --> 33:00.546
He said that Simon
showed a lone wolf

33:00.646 --> 33:03.215
mentality and was not
a team player.

33:03.315 --> 33:06.052
I guess the professor was right.

33:06.152 --> 33:07.586
These two had history.

33:07.686 --> 33:09.655
Yeah, and if we
want to know more,

33:09.755 --> 33:11.623
we need to find those files.

33:11.723 --> 33:14.826
Which means, uh,
we need to find our hit man.

33:14.926 --> 33:16.695
Go.

33:21.967 --> 33:23.202
Come on, fellas.

33:23.302 --> 33:25.337
We need to know where
you already have roadblocks

33:25.437 --> 33:26.972
and where we still need them.

33:27.806 --> 33:30.142
We are all
on the same team here.

33:33.812 --> 33:36.282
Hope things are going
better for you.

33:36.382 --> 33:37.516
That bad, huh?

33:37.616 --> 33:39.451
After the initial
blood trail went cold,

33:39.551 --> 33:41.053
there's been no sign
of Simon Williams.

33:41.153 --> 33:42.388
It's like he disappeared.

33:42.488 --> 33:44.823
Any leads from county police?
No.

33:44.923 --> 33:47.693
They're claiming jurisdiction
and keeping us in the dark.

33:47.793 --> 33:50.562
Apparently, they do things
a certain way.

33:50.662 --> 33:52.398
Sound familiar?

33:52.498 --> 33:54.032
Yeah, for a couple reasons.

33:54.133 --> 33:57.069
Had a feeling the county
wasn't gonna play nice, so, um,

33:57.169 --> 33:59.438
I'm here with Kasie.
We're monitoring all their radio

33:59.538 --> 34:01.039
transmissions.
Hi, Jess.

34:01.140 --> 34:02.774
Get anything useful yet?

34:02.874 --> 34:04.710
Ah, it's mostly idle chatter
and some crosstalk.

34:04.810 --> 34:06.845
A few dirty cop jokes,
but nothing original.

34:06.945 --> 34:08.380
Yeah, we'll let you know
if we hear

34:08.480 --> 34:10.082
about a wounded hit man
on a motorcycle.

34:10.182 --> 34:12.451
Wait. Hold up.

34:12.551 --> 34:13.685
What? You got something, Kase?

34:13.785 --> 34:17.656
Uh, yeah,
but it's not a motorcycle.

34:17.756 --> 34:19.658
County sheriff
just did a roll call

34:19.758 --> 34:22.161
and one squad car
failed to check in.

34:22.261 --> 34:23.362
Which one?

34:23.462 --> 34:24.530
Unit 117.

34:24.630 --> 34:28.467
Hey, I need a location
on Unit 117.

34:30.802 --> 34:34.573
Guys, 117.

34:36.675 --> 34:38.910
Anybody have eyes on Unit 117?

34:39.010 --> 34:41.012
117.

34:44.049 --> 34:46.518
Uh, that's a negative.

34:46.618 --> 34:48.920
You hear that? Sounds like
we have a missing squad car.

34:49.020 --> 34:50.556
McGEE:
Yeah, Kase is already
doing her thing.

34:50.656 --> 34:54.260
Pulling up the GPS locator
on Unit 117.

34:54.360 --> 34:55.594
I have a bad feeling whoever was

34:55.694 --> 34:56.928
in that squad car
is already dead.

34:57.028 --> 34:58.497
Yeah, and now Simon Williams is

34:58.597 --> 35:00.098
on four wheels instead of two.

35:03.369 --> 35:04.703
I think you're both right.

35:04.803 --> 35:08.140
The squad car is already
40 miles away

35:08.240 --> 35:11.343
on a stretch of farmland
outside of Madison.

35:11.443 --> 35:12.511
And it's not moving.

35:12.611 --> 35:14.180
So, Simon had time

35:14.280 --> 35:15.947
to dump the car and escape.

35:16.047 --> 35:17.316
Are we too late?

35:17.416 --> 35:18.950
One way to find out.

35:25.591 --> 35:28.026
Got eyes
on our missing squad car.

35:28.126 --> 35:30.028
Yeah, no sign of movement.

35:30.128 --> 35:32.798
Move in. Carefully.

35:32.898 --> 35:34.933
Roger that.

35:39.871 --> 35:41.973
Found fresh blood here.

35:45.377 --> 35:47.145
And a fresh body.

35:47.246 --> 35:49.348
Simon was here.

35:52.918 --> 35:55.521
Looks like
he tried to stop the bleeding.

35:58.089 --> 36:00.892
And it looks like
it didn't work.

36:20.912 --> 36:23.949
Federal agents.
Don't move.

36:24.049 --> 36:26.084
It's over, Simon.

36:28.687 --> 36:31.056
McGee, this is not
the guy on our wall.

36:32.190 --> 36:33.725
Who are you?

36:33.825 --> 36:35.927
I'm... Simon...

36:36.027 --> 36:37.963
Williams.

36:38.063 --> 36:41.132
Yeah? Then who the hell is this?

36:42.334 --> 36:43.769
That's...

36:43.869 --> 36:46.572
Simon Williams.

36:48.507 --> 36:51.777
We're all Simon Williams.

36:56.448 --> 36:58.049
No, no, no, no, no.

37:04.690 --> 37:06.758
He's gone.

37:11.062 --> 37:13.231
My best guess--
this man is at least

37:13.332 --> 37:15.567
30 years too young
to be the real Simon Williams.

37:15.667 --> 37:17.102
So who is he?

37:17.202 --> 37:18.870
I have no idea.
Facial recognition

37:18.970 --> 37:20.839
came back negative, as did DNA.

37:20.939 --> 37:23.509
And fingerprints?
He doesn't have any.

37:23.609 --> 37:26.111
They've been burned off
using acid.

37:26.211 --> 37:27.879
So, this may not be
Simon Williams,

37:27.979 --> 37:29.981
but he sure did act
like a wanted hitman.

37:30.081 --> 37:32.183
Maybe a copycat?
Or an employee.

37:32.284 --> 37:34.019
One of many, it seems.

37:34.986 --> 37:38.290
"We're all Simon Williams."

37:39.725 --> 37:42.127
This isn't over.

37:46.865 --> 37:48.967
You know,
it's been a really long day.

37:50.402 --> 37:52.538
It's getting late. Maybe
we should all take a break,

37:52.638 --> 37:53.839
you know?
Start fresh in the morning.

37:53.939 --> 37:55.974
No, we're good.

37:56.074 --> 37:58.043
And Jesse and I have to catch
a late flight out tonight.

37:58.143 --> 37:59.578
Okay, well, then,
when was the last time

37:59.678 --> 38:00.946
either of you
had something to eat?

38:01.046 --> 38:03.014
Hmm.
He does make a good point there.

38:03.114 --> 38:06.518
All right. I could go for
something before the flight.

38:06.618 --> 38:08.654
Do you know where I can get
blueberry pancakes?

38:08.754 --> 38:10.389
As a matter of fact, I do.

38:10.489 --> 38:13.024
Let's just finish up our work
here, we'll meet up later.

38:13.124 --> 38:15.226
I'll text Torres.
We can make it a double date.

38:17.963 --> 38:19.431
Or you know what?
We can actually

38:19.531 --> 38:22.200
just make it a professional meal
amongst colleagues.

38:26.271 --> 38:28.173
Right. I'm not asking
for the world.

38:28.273 --> 38:31.377
I just want to look at the FBI's
file on Simon Williams.

38:33.479 --> 38:35.180
Because he's a bad guy

38:35.280 --> 38:37.349
and we're all
on the same team, right?

38:39.685 --> 38:41.987
Sweeney.
He still hates me.

38:42.087 --> 38:44.790
What? Didn't you save his ass
a few months ago?

38:44.890 --> 38:46.324
I think that
made it worse.

38:46.425 --> 38:48.527
Yeah, yeah, I'm still here.

38:48.627 --> 38:50.662
That-that's all we need.

38:51.730 --> 38:55.601
Well, hey, no, I got no problem
with calling us even.

38:55.701 --> 38:57.769
Okay, good.

38:57.869 --> 38:59.805
Yeah, give Doreen my best.

38:59.905 --> 39:01.473
Hmm. That sounds like good news.

39:01.573 --> 39:02.941
He agreed to send the file.

39:03.041 --> 39:04.976
Redacted, but, uh,
I'll take what I can get.

39:05.076 --> 39:06.712
What about you?
You got something?

39:06.812 --> 39:08.079
Yeah, I mean, not-so-good news.

39:08.179 --> 39:09.848
Kasie processed,
uh, the contents

39:09.948 --> 39:12.050
of our dead guy's,
uh, burn bucket.

39:12.150 --> 39:13.785
And, uh, well,
he destroyed everything

39:13.885 --> 39:15.387
that would help us
identify him.

39:15.487 --> 39:17.689
His wallet, uh, SIM card,

39:17.789 --> 39:20.191
a USB thumb drive.

39:21.292 --> 39:23.228
The files that were stashed
at Gibbs' cabin.

39:23.328 --> 39:26.865
Yeah, she tried to recover
the data, but it's gone.

39:26.965 --> 39:28.800
Yeah, along with
the real Simon Williams.

39:28.900 --> 39:31.903
Yup. Dead end.

39:35.273 --> 39:38.376
Did you come all the way
over here just to tell me that?

39:40.345 --> 39:43.381
What's on your mind, Nick?

39:44.382 --> 39:47.118
The professor, man.

39:52.991 --> 39:56.327
He told me to quit FLETC,
just like he did Simon Williams.

39:56.428 --> 39:58.697
He give a reason?

39:58.797 --> 40:00.532
The same one he gave Simon.

40:01.600 --> 40:05.403
The professor saw the same thing
in both of us.

40:05.504 --> 40:09.908
Nick, you and Simon Williams
are nothing alike.

40:10.709 --> 40:12.911
I'm not so sure.

40:13.011 --> 40:15.781
He went to work
for himself.

40:15.881 --> 40:17.883
You would never do that, right?

40:18.684 --> 40:20.251
Right.

40:24.956 --> 40:26.758
Sweeney sent the file.

40:26.858 --> 40:28.527
Well, that was fast.

40:28.627 --> 40:31.196
Yeah.

40:31.296 --> 40:32.698
The FBI is
already tracking

40:32.798 --> 40:35.133
one of Simon Williams'
known associates.

40:35.233 --> 40:36.301
In D.C.?

40:36.401 --> 40:37.869
No.

40:38.637 --> 40:40.371
Hawai'i.

40:40.472 --> 40:42.908
That's where
the professor was headed.

40:50.849 --> 40:53.151
Hey, sorry I'm late.

40:54.119 --> 40:56.221
Is Jimmy and Tennant
inside already?

40:56.321 --> 40:58.089
No, which is odd.

40:58.189 --> 40:59.525
What do you mean?
Well, I saw them both

40:59.625 --> 41:00.959
leave NCIS before I did,

41:01.059 --> 41:02.360
so they should be here by now,

41:02.460 --> 41:04.262
but neither one
is answering my text.

41:04.362 --> 41:06.397
What the hell?

41:09.835 --> 41:13.104
Isn't that Jimmy's dad-mobile?

41:21.212 --> 41:24.349
Uh... should I call him again?

41:24.449 --> 41:26.017
Yeah, for sure.

41:33.191 --> 41:36.094
It's Jimmy's
ringtone for me.

41:41.900 --> 41:44.736
Right here.

41:50.175 --> 41:51.843
I'm calling Tennant.

41:59.384 --> 42:01.186
Hey, Knight.

42:02.988 --> 42:04.923
She ain't gonna answer.

42:08.026 --> 42:09.795
Nick?

42:09.895 --> 42:12.330
I know.

42:31.482 --> 42:33.985
Take it easy, Agent Tennant...

42:34.920 --> 42:36.988
...or somebody might get hurt.
