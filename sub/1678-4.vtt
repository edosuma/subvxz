OLDER TED: Kids, when you're single,
all you're looking for is happily-ever-after,

00:19.586 --> 00:21.918
but only one of your stories
can end that way.

00:22.155 --> 00:26.455
The rest end with someone getting hurt.
This is one of those stories.

00:26.726 --> 00:30.093
- And it starts with a shirt.
- A shirt?

00:30.196 --> 00:31.185
Just listen.

00:31.664 --> 00:33.063
<i>OLDER TED; Because none of this</i>
<i>would have happened</i>

00:33.166 --> 00:34.724
<i>if it hadn't have been for that shirt,</i>

00:37.704 --> 00:38.898
<i>(MUSIC PLA YING ON STEREO)</i>

00:39.005 --> 00:41.530
- Nice shirt.
- Right? Right?

00:41.641 --> 00:44.838
Look at those colors.
Green and brown, together at last.

00:44.944 --> 00:48.107
- Hot top, bro. Is it new?
- That's the crazy part.

00:48.214 --> 00:51.843
I've had this shirt for, like, six years.
Until this morning, I wasn't into it at all,

00:51.951 --> 00:54.146
but now it's like my tastes have changed.

00:54.254 --> 00:56.620
- Booger.
- Yes, hello, Barney.

00:56.723 --> 01:00.625
Barney's offered me 50 bucks to say
some stupid word on a live news report.

01:00.727 --> 01:03.127
Not some stupid word. "Booger."

01:04.129 --> 01:07.497
- But I'm not doing it. I am a journalist.
- What? Journalist?

01:07.600 --> 01:10.296
You do the little fluff pieces
at the end of the news.

01:10.403 --> 01:14.066
Old people, babies, monkeys.
That's not journalism.

01:14.174 --> 01:16.233
That's just things in a diaper.

01:16.709 --> 01:20.270
For your information,
my boss is about to bump me up

01:20.613 --> 01:24.743
- to the City Hall beat.
- City Hall. Miss Thing!

01:24.918 --> 01:28.445
So I'm not gonna jeopardize my promotion
by saying "booger" for 50 bucks.

01:28.555 --> 01:29.613
Of course not.

01:30.190 --> 01:34.149
'Cause now you're saying "nipple"
and it's $100.

01:34.294 --> 01:36.762
(WHISPERING) Step into my web.

01:39.365 --> 01:40.491
Whose bourbon is this?

01:40.600 --> 01:42.431
I don't know.
It was here when we sat down.

01:44.037 --> 01:46.767
The point is, I seem to like bourbon now.

01:46.873 --> 01:48.534
I could have sworn I hated bourbon.

01:48.641 --> 01:50.632
First the shirt, now bourbon.

01:50.743 --> 01:53.473
I spent 27 years making up my mind
about things, right?

01:53.580 --> 01:55.241
The movie I saw once and hated,

01:55.348 --> 01:58.181
the city I'll never go back to
'cause it was raining the day I visited.

01:58.284 --> 02:01.082
Maybe it's time to start forming
some second impressions.

02:01.187 --> 02:03.587
You're finally gonna watch <i>Goonies</i> again.

02:03.790 --> 02:05.621
"Sloth love Chunk."

02:07.026 --> 02:09.050
Not <i>Goonies,</i> Girls.

02:09.162 --> 02:10.686
What if there's someone from my past

02:10.797 --> 02:12.856
who I thought was wrong for me
at the time,

02:12.966 --> 02:17.062
when, in fact, she, like this shirt,
is actually a perfect fit?

02:17.170 --> 02:20.936
Hold up. There are only two reasons
to ever date a girl you've already dated.

02:21.040 --> 02:22.701
Breast implants.

02:23.710 --> 02:25.268
This isn't a bad idea.

02:25.378 --> 02:27.972
Let's think. Ted's greatest hits.

02:28.748 --> 02:32.047
- What about that girl, Steph?
- Steph.

02:32.485 --> 02:34.316
Okay, this is difficult to say.

02:34.420 --> 02:37.321
Back when I lived in LA,
I was pretty broke,

02:37.423 --> 02:40.950
so I spent a month making adult films.

02:42.428 --> 02:45.761
Wow! Okay. How many did you make?

02:45.965 --> 02:47.057
175.

02:50.136 --> 02:54.038
Say what you will about the porn industry,
they're hard workers.

02:54.140 --> 02:56.836
What about that chick, Jackie?

02:57.510 --> 03:00.104
...and my bathing suit
had fallen completely off.

03:01.114 --> 03:03.878
I know the feeling. Once, when I was 16,

03:03.983 --> 03:07.043
I was driving and I hit this hitchhiker.

03:07.420 --> 03:10.116
Don't know what happened to him.
Just kept driving.

03:13.059 --> 03:14.048
No.

03:14.627 --> 03:16.652
What about Natalie?

03:17.430 --> 03:19.694
- Natalie!
- Natalie!

03:19.799 --> 03:21.266
Who's Natalie?

03:21.434 --> 03:24.767
<i>Natalie, I had so many</i>
<i>fond memories of her,</i>

03:25.672 --> 03:27.936
<i>The tea candles on her dresser,</i>

03:28.074 --> 03:30.167
<i>The sock monkey collection on her bed,</i>

03:30.376 --> 03:33.641
<i>That one Belle and Sebastian song</i>
<i>she always listened to,</i>

03:34.080 --> 03:35.741
<i>Her smile,</i>

03:36.616 --> 03:39.084
Man, I haven't seen her in,
like, three years.

03:39.185 --> 03:40.345
Well, why did you guys break up?

03:40.453 --> 03:42.284
I just wasn't looking
for a big commitment at the time.

03:42.388 --> 03:44.652
Course, now a big commitment
doesn't seem so bad.

03:44.757 --> 03:46.952
Maybe I should call her.
What do you guys think?

03:47.093 --> 03:49.618
You dumped a porn star?

03:50.430 --> 03:52.125
Friendship over.

03:52.398 --> 03:54.628
Friendship over!

03:56.402 --> 03:57.270
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

03:57.470 --> 04:00.132
Come in. All right, get back to me then.

04:00.607 --> 04:03.235
- You wanted to see me, Mr. Adams?
- Yes, I did.

04:03.343 --> 04:07.040
I need you to cover a story.
It's down at City Hall.

04:07.280 --> 04:10.306
City Hall? Oh, my God.

04:12.018 --> 04:14.578
So next time you're passing City Hall,

04:14.687 --> 04:17.952
make sure and stop by
New York's oldest hot dog cart.

04:18.057 --> 04:21.026
Today, a delicious hot dog
will cost you $2.50,

04:21.127 --> 04:24.585
but back when the stand
first opened in 1955,

04:24.697 --> 04:26.995
you could get one for only a nipple.

04:27.100 --> 04:30.934
Reporting live, Robin Scherbatsky,
Metro News 1.

04:31.204 --> 04:34.173
I said "nipple" on the news.
That was so unprofessional.

04:34.274 --> 04:36.242
I said "nipple" on the news.

04:36.342 --> 04:38.367
At least it's better than "booger."

04:39.279 --> 04:40.541
Booger.

04:42.649 --> 04:43.946
There she is.

04:44.717 --> 04:47.652
Hey, is it cold in here?
'Cause I can kind of see Robin's nickels.

04:50.089 --> 04:52.250
Now, for your next challenge.

04:52.358 --> 04:55.589
There is not going to be another challenge.
I don't care how much you offer me.

04:55.695 --> 04:58.095
Oh, search your soul, Robin.

04:58.231 --> 05:00.096
You and I both know
this wasn't about the money.

05:00.199 --> 05:02.793
Sure, Metro News 1 pays you jack.

05:02.902 --> 05:07.703
And, hey, a little green salad on the side
is good for you, me, and Mr. McGee.

05:08.007 --> 05:09.736
Seriously, who talks like that?

05:10.176 --> 05:13.339
What baby really likes
is the thrill of pulling one over

05:13.446 --> 05:16.244
on those bean counters
who under-appreciate you

05:16.416 --> 05:18.281
and still haven't promoted you.

05:18.618 --> 05:22.748
And, so, for two more hundy-sticks,
baby's gonna look in the camera

05:22.889 --> 05:24.481

05:32.699 --> 05:33.893
- See you.
- Bye.

05:34.167 --> 05:35.862
Baby's gonna think about it.

05:38.971 --> 05:41.599

Is it yesterday already?

05:45.478 --> 05:46.604
Thank you.

05:46.713 --> 05:51.082
I am calling her. This is crazy.
I haven't talked to her in, like, three years.

05:51.784 --> 05:53.376
I wonder if she even remembers me.

05:53.519 --> 05:54.952
(TELEPHONE RINGING)

05:56.356 --> 05:57.983

- Natalie.

- Go to hell!

06:05.298 --> 06:06.890
She remembers me.

06:11.437 --> 06:14.429
- Why would Natalie hang up on you?
- I don't know.

06:14.540 --> 06:16.974
- Did you sleep with her sister?
- No.

06:17.110 --> 06:19.101
- Did you sleep with her mom?
- No.

06:19.212 --> 06:20.474
I'm losing interest in your story.

06:22.281 --> 06:25.546
Well, you must have done something.
Why did you guys break up?

06:25.885 --> 06:27.682
He wasn't ready for a commitment.

06:30.089 --> 06:32.216
And her birthday
might have been coming up.

06:33.760 --> 06:35.853
Okay, so I didn't want to get
a boyfriend-level gift

06:35.962 --> 06:37.793
for a girl I was just about to break up with.

06:37.897 --> 06:39.956
So you dumped her
right before her birthday?

06:40.066 --> 06:43.331
No! I didn't dump her
right before her birthday.

06:47.006 --> 06:49.839
Natalie! Hey, happy birthday!

06:51.244 --> 06:52.336
Listen...

06:52.445 --> 06:55.539
Never break up with a girl on her birthday!

I know! It was a mistake.

06:59.552 --> 07:02.544
- Well, did she cry her eyes out?
- I don't know.

07:02.755 --> 07:03.847
How do you not...

07:05.758 --> 07:07.282
You didn't.

07:07.460 --> 07:10.088
Natalie! Hey, happy birthday!

07:11.664 --> 07:12.722
Listen,

07:15.034 --> 07:16.331
you're awesome.

07:16.736 --> 07:19.500
You really are awesome.

07:20.039 --> 07:22.064
I'm just, like, super busy right now,

07:22.175 --> 07:25.941
so maybe we should just call it a day.

07:27.513 --> 07:29.105
But you're awesome.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.883
- On her answering machine!
- Okay.

07:31.984 --> 07:33.884
- And on her birthday!
- Lily, come on.

07:34.454 --> 07:37.389
Who breaks up with somebody
on their answering machine

07:37.490 --> 07:40.425
- on their birthday?
- Yeah, dude, e-mail.

07:41.027 --> 07:44.053
Not exactly the point
I was trying to make, Marshall.

07:44.597 --> 07:46.895
That is a terrible way
to break up with someone.

07:46.999 --> 07:48.762
Okay, in my client's defense,

07:48.868 --> 07:51.666
is there an un-terrible way to break up
with somebody? No.

07:51.871 --> 07:54.567
Personally, I'd rather hear the bad news
on an answering machine

07:54.674 --> 07:58.110
than face the humiliation in person.
It's the least painful way you can do it.

07:58.411 --> 08:00.538
- Who are you calling?
- Hi, Marshall, it's Lily.

08:00.646 --> 08:02.773

for at least a month,

08:02.882 --> 08:04.975
but you're awesome. Okay, bye-bye.

08:06.152 --> 08:09.178
No, that was a big mistake, Ted.
You should have done it in person.

08:09.288 --> 08:10.346
Thank you.

08:10.456 --> 08:13.584
Desperate, please-don't-leave-me sex
is amazing.

08:14.560 --> 08:18.462
Okay, it was childish and stupid.
I just... I didn't want to see her cry.

08:18.631 --> 08:21.065
Well, guess what? She cried.

08:21.334 --> 08:23.859
You just didn't have the sack
to face those tears.

08:23.970 --> 08:25.528
That was me then, okay?

This is the new, old-shirt-wearing,
sack-having Ted.

08:28.941 --> 08:30.738
- I'm gonna make this right.
- You know what else?

"My younger sister just got married
and I'm about to turn 30" sex.

11:54.080 --> 11:56.514
<i>OLDER TED; So Natalie and I</i>
<i>started dating again,</i>

11:56.615 --> 11:58.810
<i>And, just like that, it all came back,</i>

11:58.918 --> 12:00.317
<i>The tea candles,</i>

12:00.553 --> 12:01.952
<i>The sock monkeys,</i>

12:02.054 --> 12:04.454
<i>Belle and Sebastian, All of it,</i>

12:04.657 --> 12:07.387
<i>It seemed like happily-ever-after</i>
<i>wasn't far off,</i>

12:08.127 --> 12:10.994
Well, I better run.
I have my Krav Maga class in half an hour.

12:11.097 --> 12:14.066
Krav Maga.
How cool is it that she does Krav Maga?

12:14.500 --> 12:16.195
Thanks, honey.

12:17.169 --> 12:18.227
- Bye, guys.
- Bye.

12:18.337 --> 12:19.304
- Bye.
- Take it easy.

12:20.673 --> 12:22.140
Dude, what's Krav Maga?

12:22.241 --> 12:24.732
I have no idea. Some kind of yoga?

12:25.678 --> 12:27.475
You know, that Natalie, she's good times.

12:27.580 --> 12:29.445
Yeah, she's, like, the best girl
you've dated in years.

12:29.548 --> 12:32.073
- Yeah, Ted, hold on to that one.
- Yeah.

12:32.218 --> 12:34.243
I have to break up with her.

12:38.891 --> 12:41.223
I don't get it, man. Natalie's awesome.

12:41.327 --> 12:44.490
I know. She's terrific,
but I have to break up with her.

12:45.831 --> 12:49.062
Why couldn't you leave
that poor girl alone?

12:49.168 --> 12:50.897
I know. I hate this.

12:51.003 --> 12:53.665
These past three weeks have been great.
I should be in love with her,

12:53.773 --> 12:55.900
but I'm not feeling that thing.

12:56.008 --> 12:57.805
It's ineffable.

12:57.910 --> 13:00.071
Ineffable. Good word.

13:00.946 --> 13:02.379
So when are you gonna do it?

13:02.481 --> 13:05.109
She's probably on the subway by now.
You could call her voicemail.

13:05.217 --> 13:07.981
Beep. Dumped. Click. Done.

13:08.788 --> 13:12.280
I have to do this face-to-face. I just...
I don't know what I'm gonna say.

13:12.391 --> 13:15.519
- "I'm not ready for a commitment."
- Oh, that's such a cliché.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.858
It's not a cliché. It's a classic.

13:18.063 --> 13:20.554
It's the <i>Stairway to Heaven</i>
of break-up lines.

13:20.833 --> 13:23.768
- Well, I think Natalie deserves better.
- Better.

13:23.903 --> 13:27.236
There's no "better" in breaking up.
There's only less awful.

13:27.339 --> 13:30.672
A cliché is a cliché for a reason.
It's comforting.

13:30.776 --> 13:33.939
It doesn't matter. I already told her
I am ready for a commitment so...

13:34.380 --> 13:37.144
Oh, my God, there's no way out.
I'm gonna have to marry her.

13:37.249 --> 13:39.877
No, no. We're gonna get you
out of this. Okay.

13:40.286 --> 13:43.187
How about, "It's not you. It's me"?

13:44.390 --> 13:45.550
Six words.

13:45.658 --> 13:48.149
"You look fat in those jeans."
You're free to go.

13:49.595 --> 13:52.621
Ted, have you considered
telling her the truth?

13:54.900 --> 13:56.458
Seriously, honey, men are working here.

13:57.903 --> 14:01.066
Ted, what is the truth?
Why do you wanna break up with her?

14:01.273 --> 14:03.571
The truth? She's not the one.

14:03.909 --> 14:07.276
- So tell her that.
- Oh, you can't tell her that. That's horrible.

14:07.379 --> 14:10.075
Why? What is so horrible about that?

14:10.282 --> 14:13.877
Yeah, what is so horrible about that?
She's not the one.

14:13.986 --> 14:16.045
Why is that such a heart-breaking thing
to hear?

14:16.155 --> 14:18.749
The chances of one person
being another person's "the one"

14:18.858 --> 14:20.416
are, like, six billion-to-one.

14:20.526 --> 14:22.960
Yeah, you have better chances
of winning the lottery.

14:23.062 --> 14:26.088
Exactly. You wouldn't take it personally
if you lost the lottery.

14:26.198 --> 14:29.599
All right, man, tell her the truth.
She's gonna cry.

14:29.702 --> 14:33.035
Yeah, and he's gonna sit there,
and he's gonna take it like a man.

14:33.138 --> 14:36.232
- I have to do the mature thing.
- Wanna talk mature?

14:36.342 --> 14:39.971
I just wrapped up a live newscast
by honking my own boobs.

14:41.080 --> 14:43.173
And great TV was had by all.

14:45.150 --> 14:46.845
All right, Scherbatsky, new challenge.

14:46.952 --> 14:50.046
And this one's big,
but so is the cash reward.

14:50.155 --> 14:53.249
For $1,000... You heard me.

14:53.359 --> 14:56.692
All you have to do is get up there
on the news and do one of these.

15:04.470 --> 15:06.870
- What the hell is that?
- ALL: The Ickey Shuffle.

15:06.972 --> 15:09.566
Then, as you do it, you say this,

15:09.675 --> 15:13.839
"Elbert 'Ickey' Woods,
the Bengals were fools to cut you in '91.

15:13.946 --> 15:16.176
"Your 1,525 rushing yards

15:16.282 --> 15:18.546
"and your 27 touchdowns
will not be forgotten.

15:18.651 --> 15:23.247
"So, Coach Dave Shula, screw you
and your crappy steakhouse."

15:24.757 --> 15:26.554
Just write it down for me.

15:27.326 --> 15:30.295
What do I care? It's not like
anyone's watching anyway, right?

15:32.364 --> 15:34.696
And she's gonna cry.

15:36.502 --> 15:38.800
Sloth love Chunk.

15:39.838 --> 15:41.271
Thanks, Lil.

15:42.141 --> 15:44.939
<i>So the next night,</i>
<i>I took Natalie out to dinner</i>

15:45.044 --> 15:46.602
<i>to do the mature thing,</i>

15:47.413 --> 15:49.506
Look, Natalie, there's something
I have to say.

15:49.615 --> 15:51.708
Oh, wait, wait.
There's something I have to say first.

15:51.817 --> 15:56.413
Today at work I had not one, not two,
but three birthday cakes.

15:56.522 --> 15:59.013
So, tonight, can we just skip the cake?

15:59.825 --> 16:01.725
- Today is your birthday?
- Yeah.

16:01.827 --> 16:03.727
No, it's okay.
I wasn't telling anyone about it.

16:03.829 --> 16:05.694
Today is your birthday!

16:09.201 --> 16:12.364
- I didn't get you anything.
- Oh, it's okay.

16:13.172 --> 16:15.936
You know, you've already given me
the best present of all.

16:17.309 --> 16:19.174
I can trust again.

16:22.114 --> 16:23.445
You're welcome.

16:28.921 --> 16:30.752
Oh, so much more wine.

16:37.963 --> 16:40.989
Henry, as New York's oldest
hansom-cab driver,

16:41.100 --> 16:42.260
you've seen quite a lot.

16:42.668 --> 16:46.536
<i>In your past 60 years on the job,</i>
<i>what is your most exciting memory?</i>

16:47.239 --> 16:48.706
<i>Well,,,</i>

16:48.807 --> 16:51.435
- This is it.
- Oh, boy, here we go.

16:51.543 --> 16:54.239
Everyone, everyone, if I may
direct your attention to the television.

16:54.346 --> 16:56.678
You are about to see something amazing.

16:56.782 --> 16:59.342
<i>And then in '72,</i>

16:59.885 --> 17:04.788
<i>Mickey Mantle rode in my cab</i>
<i>for the fourth time,</i>

17:04.990 --> 17:07.117
Come on, baby, bring it home.

17:07.226 --> 17:10.023
<i>But the most exciting moment,</i>

17:10.462 --> 17:13.829
<i>that would have to be this one, right now,</i>

17:14.733 --> 17:18.669
<i>- What?</i>
<i>- Look at me, I'm on TV,</i>

17:19.338 --> 17:22.364
<i>I never thought I'd have my story told,</i>

17:23.409 --> 17:25.843
<i>Thank you, Miss Robin Scherbatsky,</i>

17:26.545 --> 17:27.671
<i>Thank you,</i>

17:27.780 --> 17:31.910
<i>OLDER TED; And, right then, Aunt Robin</i>
<i>realized how important her job truly was,</i>

17:32.017 --> 17:34.508
<i>It's an honor to tell your story, Henry,</i>

17:35.854 --> 17:39.517
<i>You know, Metro News 1</i>
<i>may not be number one in viewership,</i>

17:39.625 --> 17:41.752
<i>but this reporter takes pride in,,,</i>

17:41.860 --> 17:43.054
<i>(EX CLAIMS)</i>

17:43.162 --> 17:46.325
<i>ROBIN; Oh, my God,</i>
<i>I'm covered in horse crap!</i>

17:46.832 --> 17:48.857
<i>And it's in my hair!</i>

17:49.001 --> 17:51.333
- You planned that?
<i>- My knee!</i>

17:51.470 --> 17:55.236
No, Marshall.
That was beyond my wildest dreams.

17:57.409 --> 17:59.434
So if you ever come to Alabama,

17:59.545 --> 18:02.309
my mom throws
these huge crawfish boils,

18:02.414 --> 18:04.780
and she's just dying
to meet you, by the way.

18:04.883 --> 18:06.578
Look, Natalie,
there's something I have to say,

18:06.685 --> 18:08.516
and there's no good way to say it.

18:09.755 --> 18:11.245
I wanna break up.

18:12.291 --> 18:14.225
I don't think you're the one for me.

18:14.960 --> 18:18.020
I don't wanna waste your time,
because I really like you.

18:18.964 --> 18:21.626
I wanna do right by you,
and I think the best way for me to do that

18:21.733 --> 18:24.827
is just to be honest. I'm sorry.

18:28.373 --> 18:29.840
Just let it out.

18:31.076 --> 18:32.475
They're only tears.

18:36.215 --> 18:37.273
(GRUNTS)

18:37.649 --> 18:39.742
I'm not the one for you!

18:40.252 --> 18:42.652
I'm sorry. I just... I thought
the mature thing to do would be...

18:42.754 --> 18:45.154
- It's my birthday.
- Yes, I know. I didn't realize that it was...

18:45.257 --> 18:48.749
It's my birthday, and you're telling me
I'm not the one for you?

18:48.861 --> 18:51.694
It's really not such a big deal.
I mean, it's the odds.

18:51.797 --> 18:53.560
It's like you lost the lottery.

18:54.032 --> 18:55.863
Oh, so dating you is like
winning the lottery?

18:55.968 --> 18:59.460
- No, no, no. I didn't mean that.
- Okay, so what's the problem?

19:00.506 --> 19:02.667
- I can't explain it.
- Try.

19:02.774 --> 19:06.642
- It's ineffable.
- I'm not F-able?

19:07.279 --> 19:11.147
No, no, no, no, ineffable.
"Ineffable" means it can't be explained.

19:11.250 --> 19:13.616
- Oh, so I'm stupid?
- Oh, God, what's going on?

19:13.719 --> 19:16.916
Okay, what's going on is
you broke my heart

19:17.022 --> 19:20.116
over my answering machine,
on my birthday,

19:20.225 --> 19:22.853
waited three years for me to get over you,

19:22.961 --> 19:25.156
tracked me down,
begged me to go out with you again,

19:25.264 --> 19:28.461
only so you could dump me
three weeks later,

19:28.567 --> 19:30.660
again on my birthday!

19:30.769 --> 19:33.533
No, it's not like that. I'm just...

19:33.639 --> 19:35.573
- (STAMMERING) It's...
- What?

19:35.674 --> 19:38.165
I'm just, like, super busy right now.

19:39.411 --> 19:40.878
<i>OLDER TED; Remember when Natalie said,,,</i>

19:40.979 --> 19:43.447
I have my Krav Maga class in half an hour.

19:43.849 --> 19:46.682
<i>Turns out Krav Maga is not a kind of yoga,</i>

19:46.785 --> 19:50.186
<i>It's a form of guerrilla street-fighting</i>
<i>developed by the Israeli army,</i>

19:50.923 --> 19:52.117
(GRUNTING)

19:55.093 --> 19:55.227
This is compliments
of those two gentlemen at the bar.

19:55.227 --> 19:58.492
This is compliments
of those two gentlemen at the bar.

19:59.064 --> 20:03.023
- "My knee!"
- "It's in my hair!"

20:05.404 --> 20:07.372
But isn't it nice to know
people are watching?

20:11.577 --> 20:15.536
- Oh, my God! Are you all right?
- What happened to you?

20:16.381 --> 20:17.609
Told the truth.

20:17.716 --> 20:20.378
Turns out the truth has
a mean roundhouse kick.

20:21.019 --> 20:22.179
Oh, man.

20:22.287 --> 20:24.983
Oh, well, you did the right thing.
I'm proud of you.

20:25.090 --> 20:26.614
I'm bleeding internally.

20:27.092 --> 20:29.117
Hey, Ted, you know what always
picks me up when I'm down?

20:29.228 --> 20:31.753
Other people's misfortune.
You missed something so amazing.

20:31.863 --> 20:34.889
Please, can we just have one person
in this whole bar who didn't see it?

20:35.000 --> 20:36.399
Fine.

20:36.935 --> 20:38.368
Are you okay?

20:38.770 --> 20:41.398
I really thought I was doing it
the good way this time.

20:41.573 --> 20:43.404
I guess there is no good way.

20:43.508 --> 20:46.136
Sometimes, no matter how hard
you try to do the right thing,

20:46.245 --> 20:50.477
you just end up flat on your back,
flailing around in a big pile of horse crap.

20:50.582 --> 20:53.881
- You saw it?
- My phone gets the Internet now.

20:54.086 --> 20:55.815
(BARNEY LAUGHING)

20:55.921 --> 20:57.684
It's okay.

20:58.490 --> 21:00.549
<i>And that's how it ended with Natalie,</i>

21:00.659 --> 21:03.457
