00:15.040 --> 00:17.200
At this precise moment,

00:18.920 --> 00:21.920
on a planet far, far away...

00:43.000 --> 00:46.720
an alien sunrise ushers in a new day.

00:59.880 --> 01:02.480
But will alien eyes gaze upon it?

01:16.800 --> 01:18.400
Or will it go unseen?

01:23.360 --> 01:27.680
Just another moment
in a vast sterile universe.

01:36.840 --> 01:39.520
The hunt is on for the answer.

01:48.680 --> 01:50.320
Magnificent desolation.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.160
- Beautiful view!
- Isn't that something?

02:18.800 --> 02:20.240
The Milky Way.

02:21.200 --> 02:23.760
Hundreds of billions of stars...

02:31.640 --> 02:35.520
spread across
100,000 light years of space.

02:41.800 --> 02:43.880
Among them the Sun,

02:48.480 --> 02:53.000
with eight planets orbiting around it,
including our home.

02:56.080 --> 02:59.960
Until very recently, these were
the only worlds we knew of.

03:00.720 --> 03:03.760
The only planets
we could hope to explore

03:03.840 --> 03:05.880
for signs of life beyond Earth.

03:16.360 --> 03:19.320
When I first got into astronomy
back in the 1970s,

03:19.400 --> 03:23.240
we knew of no planets
beyond our solar system.

03:23.320 --> 03:26.600
We didn't have the technology
to detect them, even if they were there.

03:28.120 --> 03:31.640
Our neighbourhood was the only place
we could look for life.

03:35.680 --> 03:39.400
And so the hunt for life began
in our own backyard.

03:46.440 --> 03:48.000
Over the last few decades,

03:48.080 --> 03:51.440
multiple missions have explored
our solar system's planets.

03:58.520 --> 04:00.200
And even some of their moons.

04:07.840 --> 04:10.920
But to date,
even as we continue to look,

04:12.080 --> 04:16.480
no convincing evidence of life has
been found on any of these worlds.

04:24.480 --> 04:27.000
Earth remains one of a kind.

04:32.440 --> 04:35.480
The only living world around the Sun.

04:45.120 --> 04:48.120
But as the exploration
of the solar system continued,

04:49.120 --> 04:50.680
another search had begun...

04:53.000 --> 04:56.040
for worlds that lie
far beyond these shores.

04:58.080 --> 05:00.040
You know, the wonderful thing
about astronomy is

05:00.120 --> 05:02.880
that as we develop better
and better technology

05:02.960 --> 05:06.800
and accumulate more and more knowledge
about our universe,

05:06.880 --> 05:12.360
we turn more and more of these points
of light in the sky into worlds.

05:12.960 --> 05:17.640
I mean, that we've known is
a world for a long time,

05:17.720 --> 05:19.840
because that is the planet Mars.

05:19.920 --> 05:24.200
But just above Mars tonight is
a constellation called Pegasus.

05:24.280 --> 05:27.200
This is the square of Pegasus.

05:27.280 --> 05:31.360
And we now know that around there is

05:31.440 --> 05:34.520
a star called 51 Pegasi,

05:35.040 --> 05:40.800
which has a planet orbiting around it,
a gas giant about the size of Jupiter,

05:40.880 --> 05:45.880
that goes round that faint point
of light every four days.

05:46.720 --> 05:49.000
It is wonderful to think

05:49.080 --> 05:51.640
that, in my lifetime,
in fact in my adult lifetime,

05:51.720 --> 05:53.200
in the last 25 years,

05:53.280 --> 05:56.800
we've gone from a universe
that could have been

05:56.880 --> 05:59.480
devoid of planets beyond
our solar system,

05:59.560 --> 06:04.520
to a universe that we know
is teeming with places

06:04.600 --> 06:06.280
that we can search for life.

06:16.360 --> 06:18.000
Over the last three decades,

06:18.080 --> 06:21.440
some of the most powerful telescopes
on Earth have joined the hunt,

06:29.440 --> 06:32.960
searching for planets
unimaginably far away,

06:36.320 --> 06:38.400
hiding in the dark.

06:44.880 --> 06:47.680
Planets like 57 Pegasi b.

06:53.440 --> 06:58.840
The first world outside our solar system
to be detected around a Sun-like star.

07:09.200 --> 07:12.360
57 Pegasi b is a gas giant,

07:13.280 --> 07:15.440
around half the mass of Jupiter,

07:18.320 --> 07:20.800
but far closer to its star.

07:25.680 --> 07:29.320
Just imagine what that world
might be like.

07:36.240 --> 07:39.760
A world with skies torn
by titanic winds,

07:46.360 --> 07:51.680
where its hot interior is
bathed in rain of sapphires.

07:57.480 --> 08:02.360
In every sense,
57 Pegasi b is an alien world.

08:05.160 --> 08:08.480
And we soon discovered that the galaxy
is full of planets

08:08.560 --> 08:11.760
unlike anything seen
in our solar system.

08:22.120 --> 08:25.200
Planets enveloped by fierce radiation.

08:30.880 --> 08:33.280
Their surfaces battered and stripped

08:33.360 --> 08:37.320
by the high energy strobing light
of their star.

08:44.120 --> 08:48.520
Worlds so cold
their atmospheres are frozen solid.

09:08.760 --> 09:11.280
Or great swollen planets,

09:15.760 --> 09:18.240
with the density of Styrofoam.

09:23.240 --> 09:25.320
And fathomless atmospheres.

09:30.200 --> 09:33.400
These discoveries prove
that in one sense

09:33.480 --> 09:35.800
we really are not alone.

09:36.880 --> 09:41.960
There are other worlds out there
waiting to be explored.

09:51.640 --> 09:54.440
We estimate
that in the Milky Way Galaxy,

09:54.520 --> 09:57.360
there are more planets than stars.

09:57.440 --> 09:59.600
Hundreds of billions of them.

10:01.960 --> 10:06.240
That's hundreds of billions
of places to look for life.

10:09.160 --> 10:10.720
But there's a catch.

10:10.800 --> 10:13.720
Because not all worlds,
by a long stretch,

10:14.360 --> 10:15.720
are like this one.

10:28.200 --> 10:31.640
The first planets we found appeared
too bizarre,

10:31.720 --> 10:32.880
too large,

10:32.960 --> 10:37.360
and often too close to their stars
for living things to survive.

10:47.240 --> 10:50.360
To find worlds where life could exist,

10:50.440 --> 10:53.400
we needed to look
for smaller, rocky planets

10:53.480 --> 10:55.960
in orbits further from their stars.

10:58.640 --> 11:02.040
T-minus ten,
nine, eight, seven...

11:02.120 --> 11:05.440
We needed to look
for another earth.

11:05.960 --> 11:10.360
...three, two,
engine start, one, zero,

11:10.440 --> 11:13.800
and lift off
of the Delta II rocket with Kepler

11:13.880 --> 11:17.400
on a search for planets
in some way like our own.

11:20.040 --> 11:22.520
So the hunt moved to space

11:22.600 --> 11:25.720
with the launch
of NASA's Kepler space telescope...

11:27.960 --> 11:29.080
And we have separation.

11:33.880 --> 11:36.960
...searching for Earth-like worlds

11:37.040 --> 11:38.840
in the galaxy beyond.

11:48.080 --> 11:51.720
Kepler crossed 94 million miles
of space,

11:56.360 --> 11:59.760
until it arrived in a steady orbit
around the Sun,

12:09.400 --> 12:13.600
from where it looked out
with a fixed and clear gaze,

12:17.600 --> 12:21.760
to a single patch of sky
in the constellation of Cygnus.

12:34.640 --> 12:37.280
Exposing its sensitive light meter

12:43.120 --> 12:46.840
to the light of 150,000 stars,

12:54.040 --> 12:58.360
it began to look
for Earth-like alien worlds.

13:18.960 --> 13:23.240
Kepler doesn't detect planets directly.
They are far too small.

13:23.320 --> 13:26.840
They're just specks of dust
relative to their parent star.

13:28.640 --> 13:30.120
They're also very faint.

13:30.240 --> 13:31.800
They don't emit light of their own,

13:31.880 --> 13:34.640
so they just glow very dimly

13:34.720 --> 13:38.000
in the reflective ambient light
of their stars.

13:38.080 --> 13:41.440
So Kepler has
to detect planets indirectly.

13:41.520 --> 13:45.080
Imagine that a moth just flew

13:45.160 --> 13:48.280
across the beam of light
from the lighthouse.

13:48.360 --> 13:52.160
And I wouldn't see the moth.
But if I had a sensitive enough detector

13:52.240 --> 13:55.640
and everything was lined up properly,
I might just see

13:55.720 --> 13:58.840
the brightness of the light dim.

13:58.920 --> 14:01.680
And that is how Kepler detects planets.

14:01.760 --> 14:04.800
Imagine there's an alien astronomer
in some distant solar system

14:04.920 --> 14:07.640
looking back at the Sun,
and everything's lined up

14:07.720 --> 14:12.000
so they see the Earth trace across
the face of our star.

14:12.080 --> 14:14.600
They would see
the light from the sun dim

14:14.680 --> 14:17.520
by one hundredth of one percent.

14:17.640 --> 14:20.760
It's a tiny amount, but it's enough.

14:20.840 --> 14:23.840
And if they saw
that dimming was regular,

14:23.920 --> 14:27.040
if they saw the star dim
once every year in this case,

14:27.440 --> 14:28.800
then they would infer

14:28.880 --> 14:32.880
that there's a planet orbiting
around the star.

14:51.440 --> 14:54.200
With its exquisitely sensitive
light meter,

14:59.040 --> 15:02.880
Kepler sees only
the regular dimming of pixels.

15:07.360 --> 15:09.640
Just a few bits of information.

15:13.840 --> 15:18.120
But from those bits, astronomers can
begin to build a picture

15:18.200 --> 15:20.880
of the worlds that dim the starlight.

15:28.880 --> 15:33.640
Worlds that might, in some way,
resemble our own.

15:42.280 --> 15:45.400
Worlds like Kepler-36b.

15:55.120 --> 15:57.960
The planet was
one of Kepler's earliest discoveries.

16:06.520 --> 16:08.880
Orbiting a star similar to our own,

16:10.000 --> 16:14.640
we'd found a world that at first glance,
might seem familiar.

16:20.320 --> 16:24.080
Weighing in at around four times
the mass of our own planet,

16:24.720 --> 16:29.880
Kepler-36b was one of the first
of a new class of planet,

16:29.960 --> 16:31.400
a Super-Earth.

16:41.440 --> 16:43.320
The Kepler data doesn't
just allow us to say

16:43.400 --> 16:45.600
there's a planet around that star.

16:45.680 --> 16:49.480
It allows us to characterise
those planets.

16:49.560 --> 16:53.240
So, by looking at the precise way
that the light fades

16:53.320 --> 16:57.000
and then rises again,
and the timing between the dips,

16:57.400 --> 17:00.360
we can measure the orbit of the planets.

17:00.440 --> 17:02.480
And if there are multiple planets
in the system,

17:02.560 --> 17:05.000
we can even estimate their masses.

17:05.080 --> 17:07.680
So, the Kepler data allows astronomers

17:07.760 --> 17:11.080
to paint a picture
of the worlds it discovers.

17:24.720 --> 17:28.880
But the more detailed our picture
of Kepler-36b became,

17:30.440 --> 17:34.880
the less Earth-like
this super-Earth appeared to be.

17:42.920 --> 17:48.760
It orbits very close to its star,
circling once every 14 days.

17:56.200 --> 17:58.360
And, it has company.

18:01.920 --> 18:04.520
A gigantic gaseous companion

18:05.960 --> 18:09.840
with an orbit unusually close
to its smaller sibling.

18:11.560 --> 18:15.520
The proximity of both its star
and sister planet,

18:15.600 --> 18:18.760
allows us to imagine
the bizarre conditions

18:18.840 --> 18:22.640
that may exist
on the surface of Kepler-36b.

18:33.800 --> 18:36.480
The planet may be tidally-locked,

18:36.560 --> 18:40.560
which would mean that one hemisphere
always faces the star.

18:48.200 --> 18:53.760
On this side, the punishing heat could
turn the ground molten,

18:58.080 --> 19:02.400
creating rivers of lava that would
criss-cross the surface.

19:12.280 --> 19:15.640
The planet could experience
violent eruptions

19:16.920 --> 19:19.920
as the gravitational pull
of the gas giant triggers

19:20.000 --> 19:21.880
intense volcanism,

19:29.720 --> 19:32.520
each time it passes by.

19:56.920 --> 20:02.560
But Kepler-36b could
also be a planet of ice.

20:11.080 --> 20:13.320
Because if it's tidally-locked,

20:13.400 --> 20:17.760
the far side would face permanently
away from the star.

20:21.200 --> 20:24.440
And we could imagine
a freezing, cold hemisphere

20:24.520 --> 20:27.280
shrouded in eternal darkness.

20:41.720 --> 20:45.440
For now, this is all
Just informed speculation.

20:48.240 --> 20:51.920
But we are beginning to build
a picture of these worlds.

20:52.720 --> 20:54.200
I mean, imagine a world

20:54.280 --> 20:59.440
where the sun stays at the same point
in the sky forever.

20:59.520 --> 21:02.520
So, one side of the planet is
in eternal night

21:02.600 --> 21:04.920
and the other side in eternal day.

21:05.000 --> 21:09.440
And even the twilight strip
between day and night,

21:09.520 --> 21:12.720
we think, would suffer
from extreme conditions.

21:17.680 --> 21:22.200
So, Kepler-36b just goes to show
there's so much more

21:22.280 --> 21:27.600
to having a habitable world
than just the composition of the planet.

21:27.680 --> 21:29.520
There's the details of its orbit,

21:29.600 --> 21:34.600
and also the nature of the other objects
in the solar system

21:34.680 --> 21:37.160
that are orbiting
around the star with it.

21:52.360 --> 21:56.080
Kepler-36b is just one
of thousands of planets

21:56.200 --> 21:57.880
that Kepler has discovered.

22:05.040 --> 22:07.120
We now know beyond doubt

22:07.640 --> 22:13.080
that our galaxy is home
to a diverse collection of alien worlds.

22:20.680 --> 22:24.960
Each one of the over 4,000 planets
that we've discovered to date,

22:25.040 --> 22:26.640
is different from all the others.

22:26.720 --> 22:29.480
They really are an alien
and exotic bunch,

22:29.560 --> 22:32.640
and there's certainly no planet
that's identical to the planets

22:32.720 --> 22:34.480
that we know of in our solar system.

22:36.720 --> 22:40.280
And I think that reveals a deep truth
about the universe.

22:40.360 --> 22:44.840
Because although the laws of nature
that form the planets are simple

22:44.920 --> 22:46.360
and the same everywhere,

22:46.440 --> 22:50.080
and the fundamental ingredients
out of which the planets are made,

22:50.160 --> 22:52.760
are simple and the same everywhere,

22:52.840 --> 22:57.400
the nature of a planet also depends
on the history of its formation,

22:57.480 --> 23:00.120
and the environment
around its parent star,

23:00.200 --> 23:02.200
out of which the planet formed.

23:02.320 --> 23:05.400
And those are all radically different.

23:07.400 --> 23:10.080
So, each planet has
a different story to tell.

23:10.160 --> 23:13.280
I suppose in that sense,
planets are like human beings.

23:13.360 --> 23:17.480
And this wholly unexpected
but exciting discovery

23:17.560 --> 23:20.640
certainly complicates
the search for life.

23:27.840 --> 23:30.120
We needed to narrow the search

23:31.400 --> 23:33.040
for planets further,

23:33.120 --> 23:36.640
but not too far away
from their parent stars.

23:41.160 --> 23:43.400
Planets at just the right distance

23:44.120 --> 23:47.880
for their surfaces
potentially to be habitable.

23:50.840 --> 23:54.440
Alien worlds
with one precious ingredient

23:54.520 --> 23:57.160
that makes Earth a living planet.

24:18.280 --> 24:22.240
Now, you might legitimately ask
can we transfer all the knowledge

24:22.320 --> 24:27.080
we have of life here on earth
to planets elsewhere in the universe?

24:27.160 --> 24:30.560
Well, I would answer emphatically
"Yes, we can,”

24:30.640 --> 24:32.800
because the laws
of nature are universal.

24:32.880 --> 24:35.800
So, the laws of physics
and chemistry that underpin biology

24:35.880 --> 24:37.920
here, on this planet,

24:38.000 --> 24:41.960
will apply to every planet
out there in the universe,

24:42.040 --> 24:44.600
whether we've discovered it or not.

24:51.520 --> 24:54.760
The chemistry of life requires
a few basic ingredients.

24:54.840 --> 24:57.640
Carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, iron.

24:59.800 --> 25:03.160
And it also requires a ready supply
of high quality energy

25:03.280 --> 25:07.120
from heat within the planets
or perhaps from starlight.

25:11.880 --> 25:14.040
But life here on earth also requires

25:14.120 --> 25:20.120
one very important fundamental
extra ingredient, which is liquid water.

25:20.200 --> 25:23.480
Liquid water is
a deceptively complicated substance.

25:23.560 --> 25:27.000
It's a very powerful solvent.
But it also has structures

25:27.080 --> 25:30.160
which are constantly forming
and disappearing within it,

25:30.240 --> 25:34.280
which act as a kind of scaffolding
around which biology happens.

25:39.000 --> 25:42.440
Organic molecules are
orientated by that scaffolding

25:42.520 --> 25:44.640
so they can react together.

25:46.400 --> 25:49.760
Now, it is certain
that every living thing

25:49.840 --> 25:54.280
here on Earth requires
liquid water to survive.

25:54.360 --> 25:57.200
And I would say it is
a very good assumption

25:57.280 --> 26:01.280
that every living thing anywhere
out there in the universe

26:01.360 --> 26:03.240
will require it, too.

26:25.080 --> 26:27.840
The universe is filled with water.

26:28.960 --> 26:32.680
Great reservoirs have been detected
throughout the galaxy,

26:32.760 --> 26:35.600
amongst the gas clouds of giant nebulae.

26:40.240 --> 26:42.480
But just because water is plentiful,

26:43.120 --> 26:46.400
that doesn't mean
that it necessarily ends up

26:46.480 --> 26:49.080
in oceans on planetary surfaces.

26:56.440 --> 26:59.200
Of the eight planets
in our solar system,

26:59.280 --> 27:04.560
only one has liquid water flowing
permanently on its surface today.

27:10.000 --> 27:14.640
An ocean world where,
long ago, life began.

27:34.240 --> 27:37.920
Around four billion years ago,
life on Earth would have begun

27:38.000 --> 27:41.600
probably in places
not dissimilar to this,

27:41.680 --> 27:45.880
where there's geothermal activity,
a source of energy,

27:45.960 --> 27:49.920
in contact with rich concentrations
of reactive chemical elements

27:50.000 --> 27:54.760
and minerals, but also crucially, that.

27:54.840 --> 27:58.160
The magical solvent, liquid water.

27:58.240 --> 28:04.640
Now, many rocky planets out there
in the galaxy will probably have this,

28:04.720 --> 28:08.440
but far fewer, we think, will have that.

28:08.520 --> 28:12.160
Large bodies of liquid water
on the surface.

28:12.240 --> 28:14.480
So, that's why
there's a kind of a catchphrase

28:14.560 --> 28:16.200
in the astro-biology community,

28:16.320 --> 28:19.440
which is if you want to search for life,

28:20.560 --> 28:22.000
follow the water.

28:35.800 --> 28:37.960
Whilst life on Earth was evolving,

28:45.120 --> 28:47.600
124 light years away,

28:48.640 --> 28:52.680
amidst a collapsing cloud
of gas, dust and ice,

28:57.680 --> 28:59.720
a small star was born.

29:06.520 --> 29:10.080
And the cloud's
swirling leftovers condensed

29:10.160 --> 29:12.560
to form a brand new world.

29:19.640 --> 29:24.200
In 2015, Kepler found a planet
orbiting comfortably

29:24.280 --> 29:26.200
within its star's habitable zone.

29:41.680 --> 29:44.440
More than eight times
the mass of the Earth,

29:44.520 --> 29:47.000
K2-18b is a giant,

29:57.200 --> 29:59.960
with a powerful gravitational pull.

30:10.040 --> 30:11.840
If the planet is rocky,

30:11.920 --> 30:15.240
this may have allowed it to hang on
to a thick atmosphere.

30:18.320 --> 30:22.760
K2-18b might have
all the makings of a water world.

30:28.920 --> 30:34.360
And a legendary space telescope had
Kepler's new discovery in its sights.

30:40.840 --> 30:44.200
The most powerful space telescope
of them all

30:44.280 --> 30:45.400
had joined the hunt.

30:51.640 --> 30:56.440
Hubble examined the light
from K2-18b's parent star,

30:56.520 --> 30:58.520
as the planet passed in front of it,

31:00.840 --> 31:05.160
and detected, what may be,
a faint signature...

31:06.880 --> 31:08.360
of water vapour.

31:13.600 --> 31:16.320
124 light years from Earth,

31:17.760 --> 31:21.840
we may have, at last, found
the evidence of water

31:21.920 --> 31:23.600
on an alien world.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.440
This was the first observation

31:27.520 --> 31:29.400
of water vapour in the atmosphere

31:29.480 --> 31:33.800
of a planet orbiting
in the habitable zone around its star.

31:33.880 --> 31:36.360
Now, admittedly, measurements
of the amount of water vapour

31:36.440 --> 31:37.880
in the atmosphere is pretty wide.

31:37.960 --> 31:42.320
It's somewhere between 0.01 percent
and 50 percent.

31:42.400 --> 31:44.560
I mean, this is a planet
that's a long way away.

31:44.640 --> 31:45.920
But, for comparison,

31:46.000 --> 31:51.520
our planet has a few percent
water vapour in its atmosphere.

31:51.640 --> 31:54.240
So, that observation is important
for two reasons.

31:54.320 --> 31:56.480
One is, it is not zero.

31:56.560 --> 31:58.880
There is water vapour in the atmosphere.

31:58.960 --> 32:02.560
But, secondly, if the measurement
is at the lower end,

32:02.640 --> 32:05.440
a few percent of water vapour
in the atmosphere,

32:05.520 --> 32:10.360
then that is consistent
with this world being a planet

32:10.440 --> 32:14.200
with oceans on its surface.

32:20.160 --> 32:22.920
The nature of this planet is
currently the subject

32:23.000 --> 32:25.360
of intense scientific debate.

32:27.000 --> 32:30.120
The planet may be
more like a mini-Neptune,

32:31.560 --> 32:33.160
a gas planet.

32:36.920 --> 32:40.960
But, it is possible to dream
of a rocky alien world

32:41.040 --> 32:43.320
with skies full of clouds,

32:47.640 --> 32:50.240
where water droplets collect,

32:52.080 --> 32:53.680
and eventually fall,

32:58.720 --> 33:00.960
feeding vast oceans...

33:03.520 --> 33:07.680
that cover the surface
of a massive planet.

33:10.640 --> 33:12.280
A water world,

33:21.040 --> 33:23.160
where the elixir of life...

33:25.000 --> 33:26.800
is in plentiful supply.

33:34.120 --> 33:35.840
K218-b is exciting

33:35.920 --> 33:38.360
because it's the smallest world

33:38.440 --> 33:41.000
with an atmosphere
that we've been able to analyse.

33:41.080 --> 33:43.840
And we've found
that its mass and density,

33:43.920 --> 33:45.960
and composition of its atmosphere,

33:46.040 --> 33:50.080
and it's orbit are consistent
with it being a world with water.

33:51.920 --> 33:56.040
And it might be a world
with oceans on its surface.

33:56.120 --> 33:58.200
We don't know for sure,

33:58.280 --> 34:02.360
but just imagine
what that small, faraway world

34:02.440 --> 34:06.080
around a faint red star might be like.

34:13.560 --> 34:16.400
Kepler went on to make
many more discoveries...

34:28.200 --> 34:31.400
until, in October 2018,

34:31.480 --> 34:33.960
it finally ran out of fuel.

34:40.640 --> 34:46.720
After nine years, it had found
over 2500 alien worlds...

34:53.760 --> 34:59.400
showing us just how common
potentially Earth-like planets might be.

35:12.560 --> 35:16.280
We estimate that there may
be around 20 billion

35:16.360 --> 35:18.680
potentially Earth-like worlds,

35:18.760 --> 35:22.320
that's rocky planets
in the habitable zone around a star

35:22.400 --> 35:27.120
that may support liquid water
on the surface, in our galaxy.

35:27.200 --> 35:31.400
That is 20 billion
potential homes for life.

35:42.160 --> 35:44.440
Now, we don't know the probability

35:44.520 --> 35:48.560
that given the right conditions,
life will begin on a planet.

35:48.960 --> 35:51.960
But we do have evidence, from our world.

35:52.040 --> 35:54.160
What we know is that here on Earth,

35:54.240 --> 35:56.960
life began pretty much
as soon as it could

35:57.040 --> 35:59.360
after the Earth had formed
and cooled down,

35:59.440 --> 36:01.920
and the oceans formed on its surface.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.280
So that might suggest
that whilst there isn't

36:04.360 --> 36:06.680
a sense of inevitability
about the origin of life

36:06.760 --> 36:08.360
given the right conditions,

36:08.440 --> 36:12.000
it might, at least,
be reasonably probable.

36:12.080 --> 36:15.040
So, I think that there is
at least a chance

36:15.120 --> 36:19.320
that life may have begun
on some, perhaps many,

36:19.400 --> 36:23.120
of those 20 billion Earth-like worlds
out there in our galaxy.

36:25.400 --> 36:29.400
But I think there are
two questions about life.

36:29.480 --> 36:33.080
One question is about the origin,
and the existence of microbes,

36:33.160 --> 36:35.440
but often, when we speak about aliens,

36:35.520 --> 36:40.480
what we really mean is not microbes,
but complex creatures.

36:40.560 --> 36:44.320
Indeed, things that we can
speak to, civilisations.

36:44.400 --> 36:47.640
What is the probability there will be
other civilisations out there

36:47.720 --> 36:49.000
in the Milky Way?

36:49.360 --> 36:52.800
Well, again, the answer is,
we don't know.

36:52.880 --> 36:55.680
But there are observations we can make.

36:55.760 --> 36:58.640
Patterns we can see in the Milky Way

36:58.720 --> 37:01.920
that might allow us
to make an educated guess.

37:40.240 --> 37:42.200
We don't know precisely

37:42.280 --> 37:46.400
how we highly-intelligent
complex creatures came to be here.

37:56.560 --> 37:58.920
But we do know, for certain,

37:59.000 --> 38:01.440
that life on Earth didn't
begin this way.

38:04.960 --> 38:08.080
We are the product of a story
that has been playing out

38:08.160 --> 38:11.480
for over a quarter
of the age of the Universe.

38:14.720 --> 38:16.280
From microbes...

38:17.400 --> 38:23.000
to a global technological civilisation,
reaching out for others.

38:24.920 --> 38:28.840
For now, at least,
we remain surrounded by silence.

38:28.920 --> 38:32.560
The messages we've sent out
into the cosmos remain unanswered,

38:32.640 --> 38:35.440
and the telescopes we use
to scan the skies

38:35.520 --> 38:38.480
for alien signals remain quiet.

38:38.560 --> 38:40.080
Now, that's not to say, of course,

38:40.160 --> 38:42.680
that there aren't
other civilisations out there.

38:42.760 --> 38:46.720
We may have been looking
for the wrong thing, in the wrong place.

38:46.840 --> 38:51.560
But I think the answer to the question
of the great silence can be found here,

38:51.640 --> 38:52.720
on Earth.

38:52.800 --> 38:56.960
Because, here, it took
four billion years of stability

38:57.040 --> 38:58.600
for a civilisation to emerge.

38:58.680 --> 39:01.320
That is a vast amount of time.

39:01.400 --> 39:04.520
And when we look to the other worlds
out there in the Milky Way,

39:04.600 --> 39:08.560
it's those two things,
stability and time,

39:08.640 --> 39:12.160
that appear to be
very rare commodities indeed.

39:21.840 --> 39:27.080
In 2013, the European Space Agency
launched the Gaia Space Telescope.

39:30.320 --> 39:35.560
Its mission, to survey the stars
of our galaxy, the Milky Way.

39:37.840 --> 39:40.640
Billions of stars have been mapped.

39:44.920 --> 39:49.880
Each star, a potential host
for alien worlds.

39:54.160 --> 39:57.960
And patterns are
already beginning to emerge.

40:11.960 --> 40:14.840
Not all stars exist alone.

40:20.240 --> 40:22.520
Some have company.

40:30.840 --> 40:32.760
And, bizarre as they seem,

40:32.840 --> 40:35.400
Gaia has discovered around a million

40:35.480 --> 40:38.960
of these binary
or multiple star systems.

40:43.560 --> 40:46.120
We've known for a long time
that binary star systems,

40:46.200 --> 40:49.280
and indeed, multiple star systems exist,

40:49.360 --> 40:52.880
but we didn't know
precisely how common they are.

40:55.040 --> 40:58.120
But now, we have
a huge amount of high-precision data,

40:58.200 --> 41:00.760
including the Gaia data, which tells us

41:00.840 --> 41:05.080
that around 50 percent
of all sun-like stars are

41:05.160 --> 41:06.680
in multiple star systems.

41:06.760 --> 41:10.760
And for more massive stars,
that number is 80 percent.

41:15.640 --> 41:20.160
So, how does the prevalence
of multiple star systems in the galaxy

41:20.240 --> 41:23.800
shift the odds in the hunt
for another Earth?

41:25.880 --> 41:30.960
Could Earth-like planets exist
in multiple star systems?

41:31.040 --> 41:34.520
And, if so, what might their fate be?

41:40.440 --> 41:43.880
In 2020, we may have found a clue.

41:44.920 --> 41:50.280
A planet the size of Mars, floating
freely through the galaxy.

41:52.000 --> 41:54.440
A so-called rogue world.

41:56.360 --> 41:59.960
But planets can't form alone
in interstellar space.

42:00.840 --> 42:02.680
So, where did it come from?

42:19.360 --> 42:20.920
Dawn...

42:28.200 --> 42:30.880
ushered in not by one star...

42:35.560 --> 42:36.760
but two.

42:46.320 --> 42:50.280
Perhaps the rogue world grew up
in a close binary system.

43:04.360 --> 43:07.800
Subject to the gravitational pull
of two stars...

43:15.600 --> 43:18.000
its orbit may have been unstable...

43:26.480 --> 43:30.680
as its parent stars fought
to control its destiny.

43:44.480 --> 43:46.920
But, even in single star systems,

43:47.000 --> 43:50.240
the weak gravitational interactions
between the planets

43:50.320 --> 43:51.960
can change their orbits.

43:52.040 --> 43:55.680
Now, in a double star system,
the planets are not only subjected

43:55.760 --> 43:57.960
to the gravitational pulls
of each other,

43:58.040 --> 44:00.840
they're subjected
to the stronger gravitational pull

44:00.920 --> 44:02.560
of another star.

44:02.640 --> 44:06.000
So, even if a planet gets
into a stable orbit,

44:06.080 --> 44:10.440
it's very likely that it won't
stay in that orbit for long.

44:10.520 --> 44:11.840
So, in double star systems,

44:11.920 --> 44:16.440
the line between order
and chaos is very thin indeed.

44:21.920 --> 44:25.040
Even subtle changes
in a planet's orbit can lead

44:25.120 --> 44:27.560
to dramatic changes in climate.

44:28.600 --> 44:33.680
And that's why the surface conditions
on planets in double star systems may

44:33.760 --> 44:37.920
be unlikely to remain
stable enough for long enough

44:38.000 --> 44:40.520
for intelligent life to evolve.

44:48.680 --> 44:51.640
And the changes
in the orbits of planets can

44:51.720 --> 44:55.480
sometimes be anything but subtle.

45:14.640 --> 45:16.760
A close encounter...

45:18.840 --> 45:22.920
may have given the rogue world
a final gravitational Kick...

45:43.840 --> 45:45.600
flinging it outwards...

45:49.480 --> 45:53.600
and releasing it
from the grip of its parent stars,

45:59.280 --> 46:01.200
setting it loose...

46:06.600 --> 46:09.080
on a journey through the galaxy.

46:24.080 --> 46:26.640
Far from the warmth of its stars,

46:28.240 --> 46:32.320
any liquid water the rogue world
might once have had...

46:36.840 --> 46:38.520
Would have frozen solid.

46:44.000 --> 46:47.040
Any atmosphere that once protected it...

46:55.000 --> 46:58.320
would have frozen out onto the surface.

47:02.360 --> 47:04.760
The rogue would have become a world...

47:07.400 --> 47:12.240
with conditions
that no living thing could endure.

47:15.160 --> 47:19.440
An entire planet alone and adrift,

47:26.280 --> 47:31.080
only to be detected by us,
millions of years later.

47:32.920 --> 47:36.560
A small Earth-like rogue planet...

47:38.360 --> 47:40.760
roaming the darkness of space

47:41.560 --> 47:43.040
for eternity.

47:53.840 --> 47:57.920
This lonely, wandering planet is
not a unique world.

47:58.000 --> 48:00.320
Although rogue planets are
very difficult to detect,

48:00.400 --> 48:05.360
it's estimated that there may be
over 100 billion of them in our galaxy.

48:05.440 --> 48:08.600
Rogue planets might be
the most common type of planet

48:08.680 --> 48:09.680
in the Milky Way.

48:11.080 --> 48:13.080
And, although we think
most of them were torn away

48:13.160 --> 48:15.880
from their star soon after formation,

48:16.480 --> 48:21.240
this does suggest that star systems are
not always stable places,

48:21.320 --> 48:25.120
where complex life could evolve
over billions of years.

48:37.680 --> 48:41.400
Our hunt for another living planet has
only just begun.

48:45.400 --> 48:47.880
Yet, we've already learnt so much.

48:54.920 --> 48:57.920
We found our first rocky worlds.

49:00.040 --> 49:03.880
Some in the habitable zone
around their stars.

49:12.240 --> 49:17.440
Some, potentially,
with liquid water on the surface.

49:18.760 --> 49:23.880
Candidate worlds for future missions
to search for evidence of life.

49:29.080 --> 49:33.280
But we've also found hordes
of bizarre, tortured worlds,

49:35.760 --> 49:38.000
orbiting around violent stars,

49:46.600 --> 49:49.600
and a multitude of rogue planets...

49:51.560 --> 49:56.200
where complex life,
as we understand it seems impossible.

50:04.640 --> 50:08.920
Perhaps it's these worlds
that hint at the reason why,

50:10.560 --> 50:14.440
for now, one planet stands apart...

50:20.160 --> 50:21.440
alone.

50:34.160 --> 50:37.560
Our planet seems to have
largely escaped the violence,

50:37.640 --> 50:40.000
the chaos, and the constant change

50:40.080 --> 50:42.720
that seems to characterise
a galaxy like the Milky Way.

50:43.320 --> 50:46.160
Yes, there's been
the odd mass extinction,

50:46.240 --> 50:49.360
but there's been
an unbroken chain of life here on Earth,

50:49.440 --> 50:52.440
stretching back four billion years.

50:52.520 --> 50:54.040
And if that's what you need

50:54.120 --> 50:57.000
to go from the origin of life
to a civilisation,

50:57.080 --> 51:01.440
then, although there may be billions
of worlds out there where life began,

51:01.520 --> 51:04.880
there may be very few civilisations.

51:04.960 --> 51:09.480
But that's just an opinion.
It's an educated guess.

51:09.560 --> 51:12.240
And, given the profound nature
of the question,

51:12.320 --> 51:15.240
no matter how educated the guess,

51:15.320 --> 51:18.800
I think it would be ridiculous
for us to stop looking

51:18.880 --> 51:22.360
both inside our galaxy and beyond.

51:25.720 --> 51:29.080
For, we may have just received
the first glimpse...

51:30.440 --> 51:33.600
of a world beyond the Milky Way...

51:41.760 --> 51:44.760
around 30 million light years away,

51:44.880 --> 51:48.960
nestled in the spiral arms
of the Whirlpool Galaxy.

51:53.560 --> 51:56.120
A world the size of Saturn.

52:04.600 --> 52:08.040
A find that marks
an expansion of our horizons.

52:13.200 --> 52:17.440
The beginning of the hunt
for extra-galactic planets.

52:21.120 --> 52:24.480
The potential discovery
of a planet orbiting around a star,

52:24.560 --> 52:28.600
in another galaxy is something
that I never thought I'd see.

52:28.680 --> 52:31.560
And it opens up
the intriguing possibility

52:31.640 --> 52:34.160
that we might be able to explore
not only the question,

52:34.240 --> 52:39.040
"Are we alone in our galaxy?"
but, "Are we alone in the universe?"”

52:42.240 --> 52:46.960
And the answer to that question
may lie far in the future.

52:47.040 --> 52:49.520
We might never answer that question.

52:49.600 --> 52:53.840
But I said, the question
"Are we alone?" is profound,

52:53.920 --> 52:55.720
because answering it would teach us

52:55.800 --> 52:58.640
much more
about what it means to be human.

53:02.760 --> 53:06.120
Well, I think we become
a little bit more human

53:06.200 --> 53:08.920
with every world that we explore,

53:09.000 --> 53:12.800
because that ability
to lay the foundations,

53:12.880 --> 53:17.840
to explore questions to which we may
never receive answers in our lifetime,

53:17.920 --> 53:21.800
questions for our children
or our grandchildren to answer,

53:21.880 --> 53:25.360
Is a fundamental part
of what it means to be human.

53:25.440 --> 53:30.080
It's a fundamental part
of what makes us so special,

53:30.160 --> 53:32.560
here on this little world,

53:32.640 --> 53:37.760
looking up at the stars,
whether we're alone or not.

53:53.960 --> 53:58.440
Five. Four. Three. Two.

53:58.520 --> 54:00.520
Engines start. One. Zero.

54:00.600 --> 54:04.000
And, lift off
of the Delta II rocket with Kepler,

54:04.080 --> 54:05.760
on a search for planets,

54:05.840 --> 54:09.400
in some way, like our own.

54:09.480 --> 54:12.360
We had worked together, thousands
of people worked together,

54:12.440 --> 54:14.880
and it's all coming together.

54:15.960 --> 54:17.520
And we have separation.

54:19.200 --> 54:22.120
It was so emotional to see
the project they had worked on

54:22.200 --> 54:25.400
for so many years or decades
finally go to space,

54:25.480 --> 54:29.440
and all that hope and promise,
all bundled up in the machinery.

54:37.080 --> 54:39.440
Kepler was an immediate success,

54:39.520 --> 54:44.280
discovering over 2,000 new planets
in its first four years of operation.

54:50.160 --> 54:52.360
But in the summer of 2012,

54:52.440 --> 54:55.840
the team faced a challenge
that threatened the entire mission.

55:00.000 --> 55:02.560
One of the things that
the Kepler Mission needs to operate

55:02.640 --> 55:04.960
are reaction wheels
that spin and hold it on target.

55:07.600 --> 55:11.200
So, it always points
at the same stars, and doesn't jiggle.

55:11.280 --> 55:13.200
Well, we had four wheels that did that.

55:15.400 --> 55:18.360
And we knew that we only
had a couple of spare gyroscopes,

55:18.440 --> 55:22.200
and we knew that spacecraft tend
to have gyros fail.

55:27.080 --> 55:28.920
And, after a while, it failed.

55:29.000 --> 55:31.520
Three months later,
the second one failed.

55:31.600 --> 55:32.800
And, since we needed three,

55:32.880 --> 55:36.160
we could no longer look
at the Kepler field of view.

55:38.800 --> 55:41.880
I had hope that they'll figure out
a way to work with two gyros,

55:41.960 --> 55:43.240
and, indeed, they did.

55:47.560 --> 55:50.920
So, the very clever people,
the engineers and scientists said,

55:51.000 --> 55:55.680
"What we can use, is we'll use
the sunshine for the third wheel.

55:55.760 --> 55:58.000
"We'll make this thing
reflect sunlight off it,

55:58.080 --> 56:01.000
"we'll use the other two wheels,
and now, we can point in the sky.”

56:03.880 --> 56:08.600
The faint pressure of sunlight
helped stabilise the telescope.

56:09.080 --> 56:11.080
That was, kind of,
good news, actually,

56:11.160 --> 56:15.080
because it meant Kepler was gonna
have to go off the Kepler field now,

56:15.160 --> 56:18.520
and we could get all kinds
of other stars and observe them,

56:18.600 --> 56:21.720
and so, it actually was a boon
for stellar astronomy.

56:24.360 --> 56:27.200
After another four years
of discoveries,

56:27.280 --> 56:32.120
in total it had found
over 2,600 planets,

56:32.200 --> 56:37.080
making it, by far, our most successful
planet-hunter to date.

56:40.040 --> 56:44.040
It was sad when they sent
the command to shut everything down.

56:44.120 --> 56:45.760
You know, it's asleep now.

56:45.840 --> 56:49.720
It's in orbit around the sun.
It will continue that orbit.

56:49.800 --> 56:52.880
But since it launched from Earth,
it will come back to Earth.

56:52.960 --> 56:56.720
It will come and visit us again
in about 40 years,

56:56.800 --> 56:58.960
and my hope is people will say,

56:59.040 --> 57:02.600
"This is a historic telescope.
It told us about all these planets”,

57:02.680 --> 57:05.080
and they will go up
and pick up this telescope

57:05.160 --> 57:06.280
and bring it back to Earth,

57:06.360 --> 57:10.440
and put in the Air and Space Museum
for us all to admire.
