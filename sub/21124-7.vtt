00:06.673 --> 00:11.010
[Jenny] <i>Hey, everyone!</i>
<i>This Friday, women's wrestling!</i>

00:11.094 --> 00:12.595
-[horn honks]
-[Jenny screaming]

00:12.679 --> 00:14.681
Free! Free!

00:14.764 --> 00:15.849
Free sports!

00:17.976 --> 00:19.185
-Guys, great news.
-What?

00:19.269 --> 00:23.148
This is Rob, and he's coming.
And he's bringing his entire coven.

00:24.691 --> 00:27.569
Butts in seats, right? Come on, Rob!

00:27.652 --> 00:29.487
-Hey, Rob.
-[Sheila] Come on!

00:34.034 --> 00:35.535
Hot damn, I made the list!

00:35.618 --> 00:37.746
Everyone made the list, TammÃ©.
It's a lineup.

00:37.829 --> 00:41.541
Our names are together,
fighting the Beatdown Biddies. [chuckles]

00:41.624 --> 00:43.460
I guess that means we're a team now.

00:44.169 --> 00:45.336
I wonder why.

00:45.420 --> 00:49.215
Oh, mine has got a star next to it.
'Cause I'm bright, like a star.

00:49.299 --> 00:50.258
[giggles]

00:50.341 --> 00:52.677
That means you're supposed
to win the match.

00:52.761 --> 00:55.096
Oh, so, I'm a star and a winner.
[chuckles]

00:55.180 --> 00:56.264
Oh, yep.

00:56.347 --> 00:58.349
[indistinct chatter]

01:01.853 --> 01:03.855
Well, guess it's official.

01:04.439 --> 01:05.273
Yeah.

01:05.815 --> 01:07.358
They spelled your name wrong.

01:10.570 --> 01:12.238
So, first live match coming up.

01:12.322 --> 01:15.992
We got what's his name coming, right?
Glen Clitface?

01:16.076 --> 01:17.702
It's Klitnick. It's Glen Klitnick.

01:17.786 --> 01:19.788
Don't say it that way.
Then it gets in your head.

01:19.871 --> 01:20.872
Yeah, he's confirmed.

01:20.955 --> 01:25.043
Suit's in. So, I guess that makes this
our first official production meeting.

01:25.126 --> 01:27.045
Yes! Sam?

01:27.128 --> 01:28.338
Yeah.

01:28.421 --> 01:29.839
-I'm here for you, okay?
-Okay.

01:29.923 --> 01:30.965
-Let's do it.
-Okay.

01:31.049 --> 01:32.675
-Okay?
-Fine. Personnel.

01:32.759 --> 01:33.593
Yes.

01:33.676 --> 01:35.261
We're gonna need-- You don't smoke.

01:35.345 --> 01:36.679
-It's okay.
-All right.

01:36.763 --> 01:40.016
We're gonna need a cameraman,
gonna need sound, lighting.

01:40.099 --> 01:42.477
Need a ref, gonna need an announcer.

01:42.560 --> 01:44.896
You're gonna need
all these things by Friday?

01:44.979 --> 01:46.481
In a few weeks, we shoot the pilot.

01:46.564 --> 01:49.776
Be nice to get them in early
while we have time to, you know,

01:49.859 --> 01:51.194
work out the kinks.

01:51.277 --> 01:52.237
Here. Here's a pen.

01:52.320 --> 01:53.863
Oh, okay. All right.

01:56.282 --> 01:58.743
So, the girls can do their own hair
and makeup for now.

01:58.827 --> 01:59.828
Sure.

01:59.911 --> 02:02.330
Probably gonna have to make
a budget for costumes.

02:02.413 --> 02:04.124
I'm sure you got ideas about that.

02:04.874 --> 02:06.251
-I do.
-Okay.

02:06.334 --> 02:10.046
And also that video camera
you got me got stolen,

02:10.130 --> 02:11.589
so I'm gonna need another one.

02:11.673 --> 02:14.592
Wait, wait, wait.
What, you just lost it?

02:14.676 --> 02:19.180
No, I didn't-- I didn't just lose it.
It was here, and then it was not here.

02:20.140 --> 02:21.724
[scoffs] Did you try to look for it?

02:21.808 --> 02:24.727
Are you my mother?
Yeah, I tried to look for it.

02:24.811 --> 02:27.188
If we need a new camera,
it's coming out of your salary.

02:27.272 --> 02:29.566
My salary?
You're supposed to be the rich guy.

02:29.649 --> 02:30.817
It's not Monopoly money.

02:30.900 --> 02:33.736
This is about accountability, Sam.
And trust and thrift.

02:33.820 --> 02:36.114
Oh, my God. You sound like a Protestant.

02:36.197 --> 02:37.323
Is that a bad thing?

02:39.200 --> 02:41.411
-Hey! Hey!
-[women grunting]

02:42.579 --> 02:47.125
If any of you have any information
about the whereabouts of my video camera,

02:47.208 --> 02:52.463
or if any of you happened to steal it,
bring it the fuck back now.

02:52.547 --> 02:53.548
Now!

02:54.883 --> 02:58.511
No questions asked,
except you'll be immediately fired.

02:59.679 --> 03:01.639
There's too fucking many of you anyways.

03:07.020 --> 03:09.022
All right, so you start with the lockup.

03:11.274 --> 03:14.027
-Then we go into the arm twist.
-Ah!

03:14.110 --> 03:15.737
Then we go into the headlock.

03:17.405 --> 03:20.158
And then... hammer lock.

03:22.243 --> 03:26.289
-You guys think you can handle that?
-Sure, seems manageable. Right, Debbie?

03:26.372 --> 03:30.793
Or maybe we could open
with a bit more panache.

03:31.044 --> 03:34.005
I picked this sequence because
it's something you actually can do.

03:34.088 --> 03:35.381
Yeah, it's all real simple.

03:35.465 --> 03:36.883
And all really boring.

03:36.966 --> 03:38.801
It's just essentially the same three moves

03:38.885 --> 03:42.180
you taught to Melrose and Sheila,
only in a different order.

03:42.263 --> 03:43.723
The audience won't know.

03:43.806 --> 03:46.893
Well, let's just try it, right?
We can always add on.

03:47.352 --> 03:48.770
Fine, let's try it.

03:50.813 --> 03:54.108
[man on TV] "Tete de veau"<i> is this part</i>
<i>of a calf. Fran.</i>

03:54.192 --> 03:55.568
-<i>What is its head?</i>
-[man] <i>Yes.</i>

03:55.652 --> 03:57.237
[Fran] <i>"French Cuisine" for 600.</i>

03:57.320 --> 04:00.406
[man] <i>If your </i>canard<i>, or duck,</i>
<i>is </i>sauvage<i>, it's this.</i>

04:00.490 --> 04:03.451
It's missing something.
Maybe I could find an ushanka?

04:03.534 --> 04:05.828
You know, one of those big fur hats?

04:05.912 --> 04:08.206
[Sheila] If you need fur, I know a guy.

04:08.289 --> 04:09.666
We could also hunt it.

04:10.333 --> 04:13.503
There's a feral cat colony
in that empty lot down the street.

04:13.962 --> 04:15.213
Who is Jules Feiffer?

04:15.296 --> 04:16.839
-[man] <i>Elizabeth.</i>
<i>-Who is Jules Feiffer?</i>

04:16.923 --> 04:18.299
-[man] <i>That is the Jules.</i>
-Yes.

04:18.383 --> 04:20.677
-<i>You pick now.</i>
-[Elizabeth] <i>Let's go "Broadway" for 400.</i>

04:20.760 --> 04:23.805
<i>-Answer there is: in the '84-'85 season,</i>
-Hey.

04:23.888 --> 04:25.306
<i>only three new shows...</i>

04:25.390 --> 04:26.391
Hey.

04:26.474 --> 04:27.934
I was gonna wear red.

04:28.017 --> 04:29.560
I can wear something else.

04:29.644 --> 04:31.020
What is <i>The</i> <i>King and I?</i>

04:31.104 --> 04:32.355
<i>What is </i>The<i> </i>King and I?

04:32.438 --> 04:34.357
Could you, um, give us one minute?

04:34.983 --> 04:35.900
No.

04:35.984 --> 04:37.986
[man] <i>...a musical with songs</i>
<i>by Roger Miller...</i>

04:38.069 --> 04:39.362
[softly] Okay.

04:39.445 --> 04:41.406
<i>...is based on</i>
<i>this classic American novel.</i>

04:41.489 --> 04:44.117
So, I don't wanna look like
an asshole on Friday.

04:44.200 --> 04:48.496
Oh, don't be so hard on yourself.
Your wrestling has really improved.

04:48.579 --> 04:50.623
Oh, no, we're both gonna look
like assholes.

04:50.707 --> 04:52.792
I mean, Cherry's moves are amateur hour.

04:52.875 --> 04:54.794
There's no impact, and it's not exciting.

04:55.461 --> 04:57.797
At the men's match,
Steel Horse rode in on a motorcycle

04:57.880 --> 05:00.842
and did, like, I don't--
backflips and shit.

05:00.925 --> 05:02.510
You went to a wrestling match?

05:02.593 --> 05:05.179
Yeah, you're not the only one
who does research.

05:06.264 --> 05:07.098
[beeping on TV]

05:07.181 --> 05:08.808
[man] <i>Who are Hume Cronyn</i>
<i>and Jessica Tandy?</i>

05:08.891 --> 05:10.393
Well...

05:10.476 --> 05:12.478
I'll put in extra time, happily.

05:12.562 --> 05:14.689
Whatever you want.
We can work around your schedule.

05:14.772 --> 05:18.609
Randy, whatever else
you have going on with... life.

05:19.694 --> 05:21.779
I'm not interested
in getting coffee with you,

05:21.863 --> 05:24.073
or talking to you
about my life, but, uh...

05:25.366 --> 05:26.909
we need to step it up,

05:26.993 --> 05:29.162
and Shaft's mom isn't gonna get us there.

05:30.288 --> 05:31.831
[both] What is a brioche?

05:32.915 --> 05:35.209
[man] <i>Correct response is,</i>
<i>"What is a brioche?"</i>

05:35.293 --> 05:38.880
Man, that Debbie.
You can't tell that girl anything.

05:43.676 --> 05:45.053
[clears throat]

05:47.680 --> 05:49.348
You going to a costume party?

05:49.432 --> 05:52.018
Oh, that producer guy stopped by
this afternoon.

05:52.268 --> 05:55.354
He said he heard I was available.
Meet your new ref.

05:55.438 --> 05:56.856
-What?! [laughing]
-Yeah.

05:56.939 --> 05:58.191
-Yeah.
-Yes!

05:58.274 --> 05:59.734
[both laugh]

06:00.651 --> 06:02.362
I'mma call every match for you.

06:02.445 --> 06:05.114
I only have one,
and it's a tag-team match.

06:05.239 --> 06:06.449
I don't get my own fight.

06:06.532 --> 06:11.287
So, so, so? You will shine, no matter
how many people are in that ring, okay?

06:11.370 --> 06:13.664
Just, you know,
add a little extra something-something.

06:13.748 --> 06:16.000
-A little something?
-Yeah, like a little... [exhales]

06:16.084 --> 06:18.252
-Like a little-- Like this?
-Yeah. A little...

06:18.336 --> 06:19.212
A sprinkle like this?

06:19.295 --> 06:22.173
-[Keith yelling]
-[Cherry laughing]

06:22.256 --> 06:23.424
Slam 'em down!

06:23.508 --> 06:25.885
I'mma come in, like,
"One, two, three! Out!"

06:26.969 --> 06:29.639
-We do not say "out."
-You sure?

06:37.230 --> 06:40.316
So, this is it, huh?
House at the top of the beanstalk.

06:41.067 --> 06:42.068
It's gonna be great.

06:42.860 --> 06:43.778
[chuckles]

06:44.070 --> 06:45.613
Look who came crawling back.

06:45.696 --> 06:47.949
-Hey, Tommy.
-[Tommy] You're lucky Dad's on the road.

06:48.032 --> 06:49.826
I'm not here to apologize to him.

06:50.201 --> 06:52.370
-What's going on?
-[Ruth] We need your help.

06:52.453 --> 06:56.833
We came to train with you,
the Lumberjacksons. [chuckles]

07:00.962 --> 07:02.505
[sighs] We're busy.

07:02.588 --> 07:04.340
You're sitting on the porch
eating Pringles.

07:08.761 --> 07:09.637
They'll do it.

07:09.720 --> 07:15.143
Well, we're playing the US versus Russia
as a sort of Cold War ballet.

07:15.226 --> 07:16.310
You guys, I wanna fly.

07:16.394 --> 07:20.106
I wanna literally leave the ground
and do some badass aerial shit.

07:20.189 --> 07:23.401
The audience is like, "Aah!" Slack-jawed.
Maybe they shit their pants.

07:24.110 --> 07:25.653
[Ruth] I want the whole room to boo me.

07:25.736 --> 07:28.239
Like, that's how much they hate me.

07:28.322 --> 07:30.825
But still make it about her.
But she's gotta win the match.

07:32.034 --> 07:33.744
[both grunting]

07:36.456 --> 07:38.249
How about a shoulder tackle?
That's strong.

07:39.750 --> 07:41.169
-Yeah.
-Yeah, well--

07:41.252 --> 07:43.296
How about a drop kick, huh?
Like this. [grunts]

07:46.382 --> 07:48.134
-Ha! How about a headbutt?
-Oh!

07:49.177 --> 07:51.304
No? Need more? Okay. Turnbuckle.

07:54.098 --> 07:57.435
-That's kind of exciting.
-It's kind of cool. Maybe, but--

07:57.518 --> 07:59.729
[Kurt] How about something
with a jump, like this?

08:03.858 --> 08:05.109
Something like that, maybe?

08:05.193 --> 08:07.069
Yes. That. I wanna-- I wanna do that.

08:09.280 --> 08:10.323
Seriously?

08:10.406 --> 08:13.034
In the six weeks you've known me,
you ever hear me tell a joke?

08:13.117 --> 08:14.619
Not on purpose.

08:15.119 --> 08:16.245
What did Sam say?

08:16.329 --> 08:18.915
Sam wants us
to fight two old white ladies.

08:18.998 --> 08:20.291
Think how that's gonna look.

08:20.374 --> 08:23.336
A rapper and a welfare queen
abusing the elderly?

08:24.212 --> 08:27.590
-When you put it that way...
-We do my version, we're empowered.

08:27.673 --> 08:30.301
We're the heroes.
We're like Pam Grier times two.

08:30.384 --> 08:32.720
And I used to double her,
so I'd know, okay?

08:33.596 --> 08:35.765
Unless you wanna spend
the next three weeks in a La-Z-Boy

08:35.848 --> 08:37.475
hollering about some food stamps.

08:38.434 --> 08:39.685
Do you think they'll do it?

08:40.478 --> 08:42.021
Do you not see what I see?

08:42.104 --> 08:44.106
-[grunting]
-[laughing]

08:49.028 --> 08:50.488
-[Stacey] Oh, no.
-[Dawn] Hey.

08:50.571 --> 08:51.781
You doing great, girls.

08:52.281 --> 08:53.324
[screams]

08:53.407 --> 08:56.285
So, do I grab onto a specific body part?

08:56.369 --> 08:58.412
You sort of grab everything
and fall backwards.

09:00.748 --> 09:03.334
Okay. You're not gonna drop me, right?

09:03.417 --> 09:05.378
No, I swear. I got you.

09:05.461 --> 09:07.838
It's like a fucking trust fall,
only I stare at your face

09:07.922 --> 09:10.132
and remember all the reasons
I don't trust you.

09:10.216 --> 09:13.302
Look, if you miss, my body will break
the fall. I'll take the hit.

09:14.011 --> 09:14.929
Okay.

09:16.264 --> 09:17.265
[grunting]

09:19.350 --> 09:20.434
How'd that look?

09:21.227 --> 09:22.228
So great.

09:26.440 --> 09:27.358
Let's do it again.

09:27.441 --> 09:29.235
[Stan Bush's "Dare" playing]

09:30.194 --> 09:31.571
[grunting]

09:35.116 --> 09:36.367
[Tommy] No, no.

09:36.826 --> 09:37.827
I was early.

09:37.910 --> 09:39.620
Let her jump on you.

09:39.704 --> 09:40.580
Okay.

09:41.330 --> 09:44.292
<i>âª Sometimes when your hopes</i>
<i>Have all been shattered âª</i>

09:44.375 --> 09:46.460

Ow.

09:48.796 --> 09:51.132
-âª <i>You wonder how you keep going</i> âª
-And...

09:53.467 --> 09:55.511
-[grunts] Watch it, handsy.
-[Tommy] That was good.

I don't know what to say.

21:47.264 --> 21:48.223
[woman] Oh, my God!

21:52.019 --> 21:55.647
Someone needs to teach these
Casper-looking racist idiots a lesson.

21:55.731 --> 21:56.565
[crowd cheers]

21:56.648 --> 22:00.193
Yeah, I might be a Welfare Queen,
but I don't tolerate no bigots!

22:03.613 --> 22:05.157
Save it for the match. Come on. Save it.

22:05.240 --> 22:08.744
[Sam] All right, well, this is
definitely not a match for children.

22:09.619 --> 22:10.829
Or may-- Or maybe it is.

22:10.912 --> 22:13.081
Maybe you're--
You're really never too young

22:13.165 --> 22:16.084
to know about
this country's racial history.

22:16.168 --> 22:19.379
-You guys got somebody over here for me?
-[Dawn] Come at me. Come at me.

22:19.463 --> 22:21.882
Over here, who we got? All right.
Let's go.

22:21.965 --> 22:24.509
[Dawn] Yeah, get her! [laughs]

22:25.135 --> 22:26.178
[Dawn] You stink!

22:26.261 --> 22:27.721
Can they see?

22:30.599 --> 22:31.850
[grunting]

22:38.857 --> 22:40.400
[audience booing and yelling]

22:42.027 --> 22:44.446
-Ho! Ref, that's not legal. Get in there.
-Come on, now.

22:44.529 --> 22:46.323
[Dawn] Ref! What is it, ref?
Let's do it!

22:46.406 --> 22:47.407
I get in your face?

22:48.450 --> 22:49.785
-I got this.
-I know you do.

22:49.868 --> 22:50.744
Let's go, cracker.

22:52.204 --> 22:54.539
[Sam] This isn't as awful as I thought.

22:55.248 --> 22:57.459
Looks like the blacks have the upper hand.

22:57.834 --> 22:59.503
Helter-skelter, here we come.

23:00.504 --> 23:01.505
Tag, corner.

23:02.547 --> 23:04.549
Not looking good
for the white supremacists.

23:07.761 --> 23:08.970

23:09.054 --> 23:10.972

23:15.310 --> 23:16.728
[audience cheering]

23:17.562 --> 23:19.564
[Stacey] Grab! Grab and let go!

23:23.652 --> 23:25.403
Yeah!

23:25.487 --> 23:26.488
Yeah!

23:36.164 --> 23:37.916
[all laughing]

23:48.468 --> 23:50.387
[Stacey] We weren't supposed
to show our faces!

23:52.180 --> 23:54.141
[Keith] Oh, we got some winners.
Let's go, ladies.

23:54.224 --> 23:56.560
Welfare Queen and Junk Chain!

23:57.519 --> 23:59.521
[all cheering]

24:01.356 --> 24:03.525
[woman 1] Shake that booty, Welfare Queen!

24:03.608 --> 24:05.152
[woman 2] Welfare Queen!

24:05.235 --> 24:07.404
[Sam] All right,
it looks like the Black Panthers,

24:07.487 --> 24:09.906
or whatever they're supposed to be,
have won.

24:10.240 --> 24:11.992
Justice has been served.

24:12.409 --> 24:15.245
Jesse Jackson will be our next president.

24:16.121 --> 24:18.498
Blood pressure's normal, ECG is fine.

24:18.582 --> 24:22.043
The fainting was an extreme response
to emotional distress.

24:22.544 --> 24:23.378
But my heart?

24:23.462 --> 24:26.173
If you're worried about your heart,
give Weight Watchers a try.

24:26.673 --> 24:27.966
[Bash] Whoa.

24:29.593 --> 24:30.552
That guy's a jerk.

24:31.511 --> 24:32.679
Please don't tell anyone.

24:32.762 --> 24:35.891
Tell them what, that you're
emotionally distressed? Who isn't?

24:36.391 --> 24:38.852
I've been waiting my whole life
to do this.

24:38.935 --> 24:41.938
It should be in my DNA,
but I didn't even make it into the ring.

24:42.647 --> 24:44.733
You don't wanna let people down. I get it.

24:45.859 --> 24:47.068
[sighs]

24:47.611 --> 24:50.238
I feel like I'm disappointing a lot
of people right now.

24:50.322 --> 24:51.323
What?

24:51.823 --> 24:54.367
Everyone loves you.
You're like Santa Claus.

24:56.912 --> 24:57.913
My mom cut me off.

25:00.123 --> 25:01.374
What are you talking about?

25:02.167 --> 25:05.420
I guess she figured out how much money
I was spending on all this.

25:05.545 --> 25:07.589
-How much money were you spending?
-[sighs]

25:07.672 --> 25:09.716
Six hundred thousand-ish.

25:10.300 --> 25:11.885
How did you spend that much money?

25:11.968 --> 25:16.181
I don't know, between renting the motel
and all your salaries. Buying the gym.

25:16.264 --> 25:17.265
You bought that place?

25:17.349 --> 25:19.893
It's easier than trying to figure out
all the fucking paperwork.

25:21.019 --> 25:21.978
[sighs]

25:22.896 --> 25:24.105
Is the show off?

25:24.689 --> 25:27.275
No. No, no, no. The show is on.

25:27.359 --> 25:32.030
No, I just-- I just--
I gotta figure out a couple of things.

25:32.989 --> 25:34.115
[exhales]

25:36.952 --> 25:39.037
[Sam] And now the moment
you've been waiting for.

25:39.120 --> 25:41.539
The final match of the night.

25:42.290 --> 25:43.333
You're gonna be great.

25:43.416 --> 25:44.626
[Sam] Introducing...

25:47.170 --> 25:49.839
Liberty Belle.

25:49.923 --> 25:51.258
[playing "Exodus"]

25:51.341 --> 25:52.384
Stop it.

25:52.467 --> 25:54.427
[audience cheering]

25:56.596 --> 26:00.809
[all chanting] USA! USA! USA!

26:00.892 --> 26:02.852
USA! USA!

26:02.936 --> 26:06.731
I'd like to call on the power
of my three favorite Americans:

26:06.815 --> 26:10.527
Ronald Reagan, Larry Bird
and Jesus Christ himself.

26:10.610 --> 26:12.279
[audience cheering]

26:13.780 --> 26:16.283
[Sam] And straight from Moscow.

26:16.366 --> 26:18.868
The commissariat for the proletariat.

26:18.952 --> 26:21.621
Here to destroy our American way of life.

26:21.705 --> 26:25.166
The Cold War never looked hotter...

26:25.250 --> 26:29.004
-Zoya the Destroyer.
-[Russian music playing on boom box]

26:29.671 --> 26:31.673

26:36.636 --> 26:37.929

26:41.725 --> 26:42.726
Commie!

26:54.654 --> 26:56.489
-Very nice.
-[music stops]

26:59.534 --> 27:01.244
You've lost, Zoya.

27:01.328 --> 27:04.664
Americans will never give up
their freedom!

27:04.748 --> 27:06.583
[all cheering]

27:06.666 --> 27:08.752
[Ruth] Capitalist pig!

27:08.835 --> 27:13.089
I will neuter all your pet dogs

27:13.173 --> 27:16.634
and fill your swimming pools with borscht!

27:16.718 --> 27:18.762
[audience booing]

27:19.846 --> 27:23.266
One last time. Defect or die.

27:23.350 --> 27:24.476
Nyet!

27:25.268 --> 27:29.981
Prepare yourself
for mutually-assured destruction!

27:30.065 --> 27:31.066
All right, ladies...

27:31.941 --> 27:33.943
I want a good clean fight, all right?

27:34.027 --> 27:36.529
No dirty business, no funny business.
Let's keep it--

27:44.162 --> 27:45.372
Zoya!

27:45.455 --> 27:47.749
Oh, a dirty move by a dirty Russian.

27:47.832 --> 27:49.834
Zoya is a dirty, dirty girl.

27:49.918 --> 27:50.752
[Keith] Count one!

27:50.835 --> 27:52.212
Come on.

27:52.295 --> 27:54.506
[gasping] Ref... My voice...

27:59.052 --> 28:00.637

28:13.983 --> 28:18.196
So sad. So sad, Miss America!

28:18.905 --> 28:21.408
-Get up!
-[whimpers]

28:21.491 --> 28:23.034
Come with me.

28:27.789 --> 28:33.336
Is it over for the American dream?
Is this bye-bye Miss American Pie?

28:33.420 --> 28:36.506
No one can defeat Soviet Union!

28:37.507 --> 28:38.508
Hey.

28:39.175 --> 28:41.136
You guys are doing great.

28:41.219 --> 28:43.471
Do you know what happens next?
'Cause I don't!

28:43.555 --> 28:45.682
-[speaking Russian]
-Okay, go ahead. All right.

28:45.765 --> 28:50.770
Please. Don't-- I surrender.
Let's talk this out like adults.

28:50.854 --> 28:52.522
-What's that, princess?
-Come here.

28:57.777 --> 28:58.611

29:08.747 --> 29:10.123
[screams]

29:20.884 --> 29:22.927
[chanting] USA! USA!

29:26.181 --> 29:29.726

How do you spell "freedom"?

29:31.060 --> 29:34.189
U... S... A!

30:18.399 --> 30:21.820
You think elbow to face will stop me?

Let's go! Yeah! Come on!

30:30.537 --> 30:31.996

30:32.080 --> 30:33.915

30:40.755 --> 30:45.635
Classic American! You run away. Bye-bye.

30:45.718 --> 30:47.595
This is insane. It's fucking insane.

30:47.679 --> 30:49.305
It's not insane. It's a job.

30:49.389 --> 30:51.724
I mean, you won't even talk to me.
But Ruth?

30:51.808 --> 30:52.851
We're working together.

30:52.934 --> 30:54.936
Is this some sort of elaborate ploy?

30:55.019 --> 30:56.229
You sound crazy.

30:56.312 --> 30:59.566
I sound crazy?
You joined a wrestling television show.

31:01.276 --> 31:04.529
Yeah, I guess you can take the girl out
of the trailer park, but you can't...

31:05.196 --> 31:06.447
Put-- Fuck.

31:06.531 --> 31:08.283
It wasn't a fucking trailer park.

31:08.366 --> 31:11.953
I was watching you and I was like,
"I don't even know who this woman is.

31:12.662 --> 31:13.955
Truly, she's a stranger."

31:16.165 --> 31:17.375
How did you even find me?

31:19.836 --> 31:22.255
I followed your parents
when they dropped off Randy last week.

31:22.338 --> 31:23.172
Like a stalker.

31:23.256 --> 31:26.509
No, like a man who's sick of wondering
where the fuck his wife and child are.

31:27.844 --> 31:30.305
And then the Russian guy at the desk
was kind enough

31:30.388 --> 31:33.516
to invite me
to the live girl-on-girl wrestling match

31:33.600 --> 31:36.811
starring daytime television's
former Laura Morgan.

31:36.895 --> 31:39.439
Which is also mind-blowing.
You put your name on this trash?

31:39.522 --> 31:40.398
Fuck you, Mark!

31:43.276 --> 31:45.695
You always fucking do this.
Whatever success I have,

31:45.778 --> 31:49.115
whatever good thing that I have built,
you wanna piss all over it.

31:50.325 --> 31:51.326
Fine, here.

31:53.870 --> 31:55.997
What, are these fucking divorce papers?

31:56.372 --> 31:58.207
