WEBVTT

00:07.775 --> 00:10.209
Any idea what we're
dealing with here?

00:10.211 --> 00:11.443
Hey, you know as much as I do.

00:11.445 --> 00:13.779
Robbery in progress at
a Stark lab facility.

00:13.781 --> 00:15.748
Suspected super-powered
perpetrators.

00:15.750 --> 00:18.450
Stark facility... Why
isn't Iron man here?

00:18.452 --> 00:21.186
You seriously expect Tony
to clean up his own messes?

00:21.212 --> 00:23.565
So, we're the only two
that answered the alert?

00:23.591 --> 00:25.457
- Yup.
- Weird.

00:25.459 --> 00:27.259
Yup.

00:28.362 --> 00:30.192
- Gotcha.
- Thanks.

00:30.193 --> 00:32.531
Main operations lab entrance
is about 50 yards forward.

00:32.533 --> 00:33.766
It's gotta be their target.

00:33.768 --> 00:35.734
Stark makes high-output
fuel cells here.

00:35.736 --> 00:39.538
Since when do you pay attention
to what Tony builds and where?

00:39.540 --> 00:42.174
Let's just say, I may
have been here before.

00:42.176 --> 00:43.742
Previous Avengers mission?

00:43.744 --> 00:45.444
Let's just not say.

00:48.449 --> 00:51.887
If I didn't know better, I'd say that
sounds like our angry green guy.

01:00.949 --> 01:03.262
Isn't it a little late for
"punk the new Avenger"?

01:03.264 --> 01:05.096
It's no joke. Move.

01:05.099 --> 01:07.161
Uh, what's going on?

01:08.302 --> 01:10.069
Wrong question.

01:10.071 --> 01:13.138
Right question... where
is our fearless leader?

01:13.140 --> 01:16.675
Good evening, creeps.
It's showtime.

01:16.677 --> 01:17.776
Now, I'm freaked out.

01:21.308 --> 01:25.753
Sync and corrections by masaca.
- www.addic7ed.com -

01:37.131 --> 01:38.864
Hit the birdie, win a prize.

01:42.403 --> 01:43.769
They're mind controlled.

01:52.279 --> 01:54.780
Who has the power to mind
control the Avengers?

01:54.782 --> 01:57.182
And who's sick enough to
dress them like that?

01:57.184 --> 02:00.486
Someone who's desperate to nab
experimental Stark tech for upgrades.

02:00.488 --> 02:04.656
Hold up. I've been on a S.H.I.E.L.D.
satellite for the past 48 hours.

02:04.658 --> 02:07.292
But how did you avoid getting
stuffed into a clown suit?

02:07.294 --> 02:09.794
Look, Iron man doesn't
have his helmet.

02:09.797 --> 02:11.263
That head ring is
the mind device.

02:11.265 --> 02:12.798
They all have 'em.

02:12.800 --> 02:15.638
Little precision shooting ought
to knock that tiara right off.

02:19.140 --> 02:20.945
- Hey.
- Take 'em off without knowing

02:20.957 --> 02:22.774
the code, and you'll
fry their brains.

02:22.776 --> 02:24.476
How do you know that exactly?

02:24.478 --> 02:26.378
Just a ...Hunch.

02:30.751 --> 02:35.315
Let's make a deal. Explain how you got so
good at hunches, and I don't drop you.

02:41.562 --> 02:43.562
Straight up, Hawkeye.
What is this?

02:43.564 --> 02:45.645
It's the Circus of Crime.

02:51.472 --> 02:54.339
Circus of Crime? You
just make that up?

02:54.341 --> 02:57.643
Show yourself, Ringmaster.

02:57.645 --> 02:59.115
Hope you know what you're doing.

03:00.915 --> 03:04.601
Got special seats for
you, right down front.

03:06.253 --> 03:08.220
Welcome to the show.

03:08.222 --> 03:10.619
I am Ringmaster.

03:14.828 --> 03:16.929
Hawkeye, you know this clown?

03:16.931 --> 03:19.698
Hawkeye hasn't told
you about us yet?

03:19.700 --> 03:22.139
Where are your manners, archer?

03:23.704 --> 03:26.271
We are the new Circus of Crime.

03:26.273 --> 03:29.274
High-tech acts for a modern age.

03:31.879 --> 03:33.946
The Human Cannonball.

03:33.948 --> 03:36.815
Cannot be stopped
by man or beast!

03:37.952 --> 03:40.419
- Leave him alone!
- Pipe down, bird,

03:40.421 --> 03:42.433
or I'll clip your feathers.

03:42.434 --> 03:46.959
The Gambonno Twins, capable
of amazing acrobatic feats!

03:46.961 --> 03:47.961
Huh?

03:57.905 --> 04:00.472
Bruto, the strong man!

04:00.498 --> 04:03.502
More powerful than a Hulk!

04:04.912 --> 04:07.346
I... doubt... that.

04:07.348 --> 04:09.738
Doubt this, backstabber.

04:10.884 --> 04:14.620
And an old favorite. Trick Shot!

04:15.896 --> 04:18.805
I bet you weren't expecting
to see him, were you?

04:19.392 --> 04:21.360
Trick Shot?

04:21.362 --> 04:24.563
Who cares? Whoever you
freaks are, you're toast!

04:24.565 --> 04:26.265
You defending him?

04:26.267 --> 04:29.268
'Cause he sure won't
do the same for you.

04:29.270 --> 04:30.836
S.H.I.E.L.D. is right behind us.

04:30.838 --> 04:33.305
Well, that won't do at all.

04:33.307 --> 04:36.556
I need a little time to
implement these new toys,

04:36.557 --> 04:40.479
Mr. Stark was kind enough to
donate to our performances.

04:40.481 --> 04:41.913
Iron Man...

04:41.915 --> 04:46.918
Let them feel what it's like
to be betrayed by a friend!

04:48.455 --> 04:50.389
The next time you see us...

04:50.391 --> 04:53.058
the Circus of Crime
will launch the careers

04:53.060 --> 04:55.527
of the biggest
criminals on Earth!

04:55.529 --> 04:57.496
The Avengers!

04:57.498 --> 04:59.031
Enjoy the show...

04:59.033 --> 05:01.677
as it breaks you, Clint!

05:04.905 --> 05:06.576
He called you by name.

05:06.577 --> 05:07.806
How do you know these people?

05:07.808 --> 05:09.574
This is personal, isn't it?

05:09.576 --> 05:11.334
What is this, 20 questions?

05:12.880 --> 05:15.447
Tri-carrier. I don't
have time for this!

05:15.449 --> 05:17.716
Where are you going? S.H.I.E.L.D.
just got here!

05:17.718 --> 05:19.468
Great! Give them my love.

05:20.487 --> 05:23.244
Fury's not going to
like this one bit.

05:25.826 --> 05:26.925
Whoa!

05:26.927 --> 05:28.794
Okay.

05:28.796 --> 05:32.898
Here's a good idea. I'll ask
questions that you actually answer.

05:32.900 --> 05:34.900
Uh, I hate that plan.

05:34.902 --> 05:38.503
Hawkeye, sometimes I think you're
the coolest guy on the team.

05:38.505 --> 05:40.539
And other days, I
can't stand you.

05:40.541 --> 05:42.774
So I'm an enigma, let it go.

05:42.776 --> 05:43.942
Happy to.

05:43.944 --> 05:45.377
No, no!

05:45.379 --> 05:47.646
Hey, come on, man!

05:51.752 --> 05:55.365
Take two. Why don't you want S.H.I.E.L.D.
or me involved in this?

05:55.366 --> 05:58.090
Because it's my fault.
All of this.

05:58.092 --> 06:01.393
That's all I'm gonna say about
it until I set things right.

06:01.395 --> 06:02.503
Alone.

06:02.504 --> 06:05.464
Mind-controlled Avengers should
be handled by S.H.I.E.L.D.

06:05.466 --> 06:08.214
At least respect that I know
that much and come with me.

06:12.840 --> 06:14.573
Falcon to tri-carrier bridge.

06:14.575 --> 06:16.365
Request permission
to come aboard.

06:20.714 --> 06:23.014
I do respect you, kid.

06:23.016 --> 06:25.021
It's me I'm not so sure about.

07:14.568 --> 07:17.936
You never did learn to check
your six, Princess Python.

07:17.938 --> 07:21.940
I never expected you to show your
face again after what you did.

07:21.942 --> 07:24.976
To you and the Circus...
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got it.

07:24.978 --> 07:25.977
Are you still with them?

07:25.979 --> 07:28.146
I'm a solo act for the moment.

07:28.148 --> 07:29.614
As if you care.

07:29.616 --> 07:31.049
Believe it or not, I do.

07:31.051 --> 07:33.718
Ringmaster took my team. Do
you know where they are?

07:33.720 --> 07:36.488
Oh, now you care
about your team?

07:36.490 --> 07:39.758
Uh...

07:39.760 --> 07:42.861
That looks a whole lot
bigger than I remember.

07:44.108 --> 07:46.131
There seems to be a lot
you don't remember.

07:46.133 --> 07:48.130
Let me remind you!

07:53.707 --> 07:55.907
Whatever they gave you
that snake upgrade for,

07:55.909 --> 07:58.643
think about what you're doing
before you go back to them.

07:58.645 --> 08:02.113
You have good in you. You could have
made a different choice that day.

08:02.115 --> 08:04.983
We don't all get
second chances, Clint.

08:04.985 --> 08:09.298
It's not too late to put this overgrown
worm back in its cage, princess.

08:09.748 --> 08:11.443
She's a princess?

08:11.444 --> 08:13.825
My snake and I don't
like an ambush!

08:13.827 --> 08:16.995
If you hadn't followed me, I would
have taken care of this, Falcon.

08:16.997 --> 08:19.446
Yeah, I can see you've
got it handled.

08:26.039 --> 08:27.906
Circus is in town.

08:33.714 --> 08:37.474
Ringmaster wants you to run away with us.
And come back home.

08:45.893 --> 08:47.275
Where am I?

08:50.097 --> 08:52.587
<i>The Circus of Crime!</i>

08:52.966 --> 08:55.901
<i>Welcome back! It's been so long,</i>

08:55.903 --> 08:57.135
<i>we'd almost forgotten you.</i>

08:57.137 --> 08:59.971
<i>But then, we never
forget a face.</i>

08:59.973 --> 09:02.674
<i>Especially yours.</i>

09:02.676 --> 09:04.780
And me without my bow.

09:09.816 --> 09:12.530
Yet another reason
I hate the circus.

09:22.930 --> 09:26.097
Always knew you were a
coward, Ringmaster.

09:26.099 --> 09:27.832
Uh-oh.

09:27.834 --> 09:31.525
Hiding behind other people
and other people's tech.

09:34.074 --> 09:36.822
But I don't think you know
who you're up against.

09:38.745 --> 09:41.062
Whoa!

09:44.618 --> 09:45.917
<i>That's the beauty of it,</i>

09:45.919 --> 09:48.687
<i>I know exactly who
I'm up against.</i>

09:48.689 --> 09:53.246
<i>And I have both his friends and
their technology on my side.</i>

09:53.247 --> 09:54.292
What do you want from me?

09:54.294 --> 09:55.860
<i>Isn't it obvious?</i>

09:55.862 --> 09:57.596
<i>I want revenge.</i>

09:57.598 --> 09:59.831
<i>I want a show!</i>

09:59.833 --> 10:03.001
<i>And all of us in the Circus
want to see your turncoat hide.</i>

10:03.003 --> 10:05.971
<i>Ripped apart by your own team!</i>

10:05.973 --> 10:08.304
Okay. Maybe I do
need some back up.

10:19.620 --> 10:23.986
Then I guess you won't be mad I
dropped a tracer in your quiver.

10:26.026 --> 10:28.927
This is where you thank me and
admit you've been a jerk.

10:28.929 --> 10:30.028
Thank you.

10:30.030 --> 10:32.720
That was only half.
No more running?

10:32.721 --> 10:34.399
<i>Oh, but that's what
he does best, flyboy.</i>

10:34.401 --> 10:36.701
<i>Leave his teammates behind.</i>

10:41.642 --> 10:44.275
So, let history repeat
itself, archer.

10:44.277 --> 10:46.945
Walk out on your
so-called "friends"

10:46.947 --> 10:49.349
while we enjoy the show.

11:02.663 --> 11:03.722
Cap first?

11:03.723 --> 11:06.117
Unless he suddenly learned
how to breathe under water.

11:10.070 --> 11:12.871
Trick Shot... I hate that guy.

11:12.873 --> 11:14.967
- Falcon?
- On it!

11:20.881 --> 11:25.312
Clever. Your wing man is much more
talented than you were at his age.

11:26.353 --> 11:29.099
Hulk and Thor next.
We need the muscle.

11:29.100 --> 11:31.823
Actually, a little humility is
probably good for Goldilocks.

11:36.263 --> 11:37.696
Falcon, 12 o'clock!

11:37.698 --> 11:38.698
Busy!

11:43.403 --> 11:44.703
Widow!

11:48.308 --> 11:50.188
Whew! Close call.

11:51.011 --> 11:54.446
Only the Circus can remove
my control rings, traitor.

11:54.448 --> 11:56.637
And that won't happen.

12:05.892 --> 12:08.026
Hawkeye, what's plan B?

12:08.028 --> 12:09.930
We're still on plan A, kid.

12:10.897 --> 12:12.013
Boom!

12:19.005 --> 12:20.905
The show must go on.

12:20.907 --> 12:21.947
Get 'em.

12:25.045 --> 12:27.045
Regretting your decision
to back me up, Beak?

12:27.047 --> 12:29.814
Never. Whatever happened
is in the past.

12:29.816 --> 12:32.217
Here and now, we're a team.

12:32.219 --> 12:33.761
I'll always have your back.

12:33.787 --> 12:34.511
Well, thanks.

12:34.512 --> 12:37.252
Looks like it won't be a commitment
you'll have to keep much longer.

12:46.133 --> 12:49.195
I will have thee yet!
Hold still!

12:49.402 --> 12:53.217
Sorry, Thor. All that training
against you at the tower paid off.

12:54.908 --> 12:56.516
More training needed.

13:06.086 --> 13:08.920
Pew, pew! Pew, pew, pew!

13:11.925 --> 13:14.292
Step aside! It is
not your battle.

13:14.294 --> 13:17.162
I'm an Avenger. That
makes this my fight.

13:17.164 --> 13:19.291
Wrong answer!

13:23.937 --> 13:26.050
- Hang on to this for me.
- Huh?

13:28.441 --> 13:30.008
Come on, green bean,

13:30.010 --> 13:32.043
the one time I actually
want you to lose control,

13:32.045 --> 13:34.530
and you're busy playing
purple pants puppet.

13:36.449 --> 13:37.949
Perfect, isn't it?

13:37.951 --> 13:40.919
With my control rings,
I'll make your new team.

13:40.921 --> 13:43.054
Bigger criminals
than we ever were.

13:43.056 --> 13:46.036
New team? Who was his old team?

13:48.061 --> 13:50.458
Trick Shot, end it.

13:51.898 --> 13:53.331
With pleasure.

13:57.937 --> 13:59.413
Penny for your thoughts?

14:00.073 --> 14:01.876
Yeah, that's what I figured.

14:04.110 --> 14:07.045
Nice shot, for an amateur.

14:07.047 --> 14:08.613
Joke all you want.

14:08.615 --> 14:10.548
Short of the cavalry
charging in,

14:10.550 --> 14:14.120
but you and your Tweety little
friend are done, bowman.

14:14.988 --> 14:16.937
Huh? Can't be!

14:21.361 --> 14:23.561
Oh, yes, it is.

14:25.899 --> 14:27.329
Princess Python!

14:27.330 --> 14:30.134
She's a princess. She
fights with a big snake.

14:30.136 --> 14:31.936
Uh, never mind.

14:31.938 --> 14:34.501
This is called doing
what's right.

14:38.979 --> 14:40.511
Welcome back.

14:40.513 --> 14:42.113
Couldn't resist me, huh?

14:42.115 --> 14:44.405
More like, you need my help.

14:49.556 --> 14:52.126
Falcon, wing up!

15:07.540 --> 15:10.002
The snake won't hold them
more than a few seconds.

15:10.577 --> 15:12.361
It's all I need.

15:13.914 --> 15:16.233
The encryption cell
is the blue light.

15:25.058 --> 15:26.058
Hello.

15:26.359 --> 15:28.059
I never knew you were that good.

15:28.061 --> 15:29.627
I have a lot of secrets.

15:29.629 --> 15:30.919
Do tell.

15:32.098 --> 15:34.365
All right. Everyone
back to normal?

15:34.367 --> 15:37.402
I hate clowns!

15:37.404 --> 15:39.504
Take that as a "yes."
Now, assemble us

15:39.506 --> 15:41.572
and let's shut this circus down.

15:41.574 --> 15:43.174
Thanks for the assist.

15:43.176 --> 15:44.976
I take it you've switched sides.

15:44.978 --> 15:47.078
Depends on who wins
today, I guess.

15:47.080 --> 15:48.680
Bet on the good guys.

15:48.682 --> 15:50.448
Better yet, be one.

15:53.186 --> 15:55.620
That was just my opening act.

15:55.622 --> 15:57.032
Strike!

16:07.167 --> 16:08.383
Python!

16:12.505 --> 16:15.306
Would have been fun to watch
your team destroy you,

16:15.308 --> 16:19.729
but the Circus of Crime is happy
to destroy you ourselves.

16:21.281 --> 16:24.683
Circus Maximus, attack!

16:41.101 --> 16:43.332
You can flip, but
you can't hide.

16:46.172 --> 16:49.366
Stronger than you look.
Uglier, too.

16:49.367 --> 16:52.220
Only room for one
strong man here.

16:54.681 --> 16:56.629
Bad news for you.

17:01.421 --> 17:03.054
Yo, Trick Shot, over here!

17:03.056 --> 17:04.454
Don't be jealous.

17:04.457 --> 17:08.736
The Circus recruited a
bowman every bit your match.

17:09.496 --> 17:12.438
Imitation is the highest
form of flattery.

17:34.554 --> 17:36.682
You know the worst thing
about cannonballs?

17:37.490 --> 17:38.731
All power...

17:39.592 --> 17:40.834
no steering.

17:45.131 --> 17:46.298
Ouch!

18:00.080 --> 18:01.300
What sorcery!

18:01.781 --> 18:03.533
It's a-science!

18:04.217 --> 18:05.217
Ha!

18:10.490 --> 18:12.841
Hey, look who just drop in.

18:13.560 --> 18:14.736
Ha!

18:15.195 --> 18:16.195
Widow!

18:17.764 --> 18:22.432
Time for your
farewell performance!

18:29.476 --> 18:31.175
How you like-a the
boots from Italy?

18:31.177 --> 18:33.355
I prefer American made.

18:35.215 --> 18:36.395
Ha!

18:41.287 --> 18:42.595
With the greatest of ease.

18:45.892 --> 18:48.869
Guess we know who's
the strongest.

18:50.897 --> 18:52.196
I had him.

18:52.198 --> 18:55.629
And I finished him.

19:09.849 --> 19:11.631
This is three-ring chaos.

19:12.519 --> 19:15.336
If you're gonna be a hero,
princess, now's the time.

19:15.788 --> 19:16.854
Hawkeye?

19:16.856 --> 19:18.256
Guess again.

19:18.258 --> 19:19.857
Back inside.

19:19.859 --> 19:24.860
This battle stops now, or
I finish this traitor.

19:29.936 --> 19:33.504
I guess you proved who
the master archer is.

19:33.506 --> 19:37.608
Python, you can keep playing
hero and share their fate,

19:37.610 --> 19:39.377
or you can rejoin us.

19:39.379 --> 19:40.811
Choice is yours.

19:40.813 --> 19:42.914
I already chose my side.

19:42.916 --> 19:44.815
I'm not a Circus act anymore.

19:44.817 --> 19:48.106
All I needed to hear.

20:01.834 --> 20:03.775
Trick Shot, what are you doing?

20:06.239 --> 20:07.599
Teamwork.

20:10.977 --> 20:12.810
No.

20:12.812 --> 20:14.471
Show's over.

20:14.948 --> 20:17.848
For good this time.

20:23.856 --> 20:25.723
Hey, Princess, want
you to meet someone.

20:25.725 --> 20:27.358
Name's Nick Fury.

20:27.360 --> 20:28.926
He's not so big on pets,

20:28.928 --> 20:33.357
but he's really good
with second chances.

20:35.702 --> 20:37.758
Something you wanna say
about all this, Hawkeye?

20:38.705 --> 20:41.339
I guess I do owe you
guys an explanation.

20:41.341 --> 20:43.874
<i>See, back in the day, I worked
the Circus as Trick Shot,</i>

20:43.876 --> 20:46.277
<i>but I never felt good about it,</i>

20:46.279 --> 20:49.981
<i>so during our biggest heist ever,
I decided to trigger the alarm.</i>

20:51.438 --> 20:55.129
<i>Of course we all got captured,
but Fury saw something in me.</i>

20:55.755 --> 20:57.488
Gave me a chance to
walk the right path,

20:57.490 --> 21:00.520
and I never had to
look back, until now.

21:01.761 --> 21:03.736
I thought you guys
wouldn't accept my past.

21:04.998 --> 21:06.376
Hate me much?

21:06.933 --> 21:07.765
Never.

21:07.767 --> 21:12.837
But keeping secrets, even tough
ones, doesn't do anyone any good.

21:12.839 --> 21:14.639
I know. And, ugh,

21:14.641 --> 21:18.457
it makes my lips itch to
say this, but I'm sorry.

21:18.778 --> 21:20.945
Hey, it's in the past.
All of it.

21:20.947 --> 21:23.633
What matters is the
Hawkeye you are today...

21:24.017 --> 21:25.921
good parts and bad.

21:26.052 --> 21:28.519
Thanks, Sam. I'm an Avenger now,

21:28.521 --> 21:30.588
and I wouldn't have
it any other way.
