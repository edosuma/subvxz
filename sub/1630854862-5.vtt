01:26.587 --> 01:28.088
I'm sorry.

01:28.172 --> 01:29.173
Jesus.

01:33.385 --> 01:34.887
You're breathing on me.

01:36.138 --> 01:38.223
No, you don't have to stop.

01:40.350 --> 01:42.436
Thank you for allowing me
to keep breathing.

01:46.982 --> 01:49.151
I'm so glad we're on the same team again.

02:08.169 --> 02:09.670
I wanna try the chair.

02:09.755 --> 02:12.674
Are you sure?
You want me to get Bev and Bobbie?

02:12.758 --> 02:14.760
What, do you think I'm too heavy for you?

02:15.344 --> 02:16.637
No.

02:16.720 --> 02:18.263
I just don't wanna hurt you.

02:18.347 --> 02:21.475
I once had a male yoga teacher
who told me pain is a gift.

02:21.975 --> 02:23.519
He sounds like an asshole.

02:27.564 --> 02:28.857
- Okay, I'm ready.
- Okay.

02:31.193 --> 02:32.528
Oh, my God.

02:49.419 --> 02:50.420
Okay.

02:57.302 --> 02:58.929
There's a new sheriff in town.

03:01.348 --> 03:05.477
It's perfectly safe.
All the users gave it five stars.

03:12.109 --> 03:13.110
What are you doing?

03:13.694 --> 03:15.779
Could you give us a minute, Leanne?
Please.

03:15.863 --> 03:18.448
She's not ready for this.
She's gonna hurt herself again.

03:20.158 --> 03:21.159
We got this.

03:46.059 --> 03:47.060
Race ya.

03:49.563 --> 03:50.981
Bev? Bobbie?

03:51.064 --> 03:52.316
We're coming.

03:52.399 --> 03:55.485
Bev's just trying something different
with her eyebrows.

03:56.320 --> 03:58.363
I forget your meds. I'll be right back.

04:14.421 --> 04:15.422
Dorothy?

04:20.344 --> 04:21.345
Dorothy.

04:24.640 --> 04:25.641
Dorothy?

04:27.434 --> 04:28.435
Here.

04:31.313 --> 04:32.314
Are you okay?

04:36.485 --> 04:38.779
I can't believe
that he let you use this stupid thing.

04:38.862 --> 04:41.031
- What did you do to her?
- Nothing.

04:41.865 --> 04:42.866
Sean.

04:43.742 --> 04:45.118
- What the fuck happened?
- I'm fine.

04:45.202 --> 04:46.828
I told you she wasn't ready.

04:46.912 --> 04:49.873
- She nearly fell out of it.
- I'm fine, I promise.

04:49.957 --> 04:53.627
Just please, all of you,
just give us a second.

04:54.503 --> 04:55.712
Give us a second.

05:13.939 --> 05:14.940
God.

05:16.942 --> 05:22.531
"CLS has laid claim to a nearby sanctuary.
We want our Wayward Flower back.

05:23.156 --> 05:25.576
Give us the opportunity
this Thursday after dark,

05:25.659 --> 05:27.578
and your family shall be left in peace."

05:27.661 --> 05:28.662
It's them.

05:29.663 --> 05:31.290
Are you ready for us, honeybun?

05:31.957 --> 05:34.751
Just a minute, Bev.
Sean's changing in here.

05:35.627 --> 05:38.213
- You think it's the new neighbors?
- It has to be.

05:38.297 --> 05:39.298
Yeah.

05:39.381 --> 05:41.675
All those houses selling at the same time?

05:41.758 --> 05:44.678
They want her back.
This is a dream come true.

05:44.761 --> 05:47.848
Yeah. But they've tried this before.

05:47.931 --> 05:50.350
Well, they'll be better prepared
this time.

05:50.976 --> 05:54.021
And maybe this time, we can help.

05:54.104 --> 05:56.523
I don't think it's safe
to get too involved.

05:56.607 --> 06:02.738
I don't mean "help" them, help them.
I just mean help pave the way.

06:03.280 --> 06:06.408
It says right here,
"Give us the opportunity."

06:08.410 --> 06:10.954
We can have a party.
We can have a cocktail party

06:11.038 --> 06:13.415
to welcome all the new neighbors
to Spruce Street.

06:13.498 --> 06:16.251
Okay, we have to be careful.
More careful than we've ever been.

06:16.335 --> 06:19.296
We can't let Jericho out of our sight,
not even for one second.

06:19.379 --> 06:21.965
Yeah, we'll keep him downstairs
in the Pack 'n Play.

06:22.049 --> 06:25.093
And as for Leanne, we'll just have Bev
and Bobbie distract her.

06:25.177 --> 06:26.887
- I mean, that's their specialty.
- Right.

06:27.638 --> 06:32.476
God, Sean, does this make us monsters?

06:34.394 --> 06:35.854
Are we already monsters?

06:40.901 --> 06:41.902
Party?

06:42.486 --> 06:44.154
To welcome the new neighbors.

06:44.738 --> 06:49.284
And we know that's not really your thing,
so we got you a ticket to the Sixers game.

06:49.368 --> 06:51.995
One ticket? I'm supposed to go by myself?

06:53.497 --> 06:56.166
Well, we'll need Leanne here. To help.

06:56.250 --> 06:58.544
Because honestly,
this thing you have with her, it's…

07:00.462 --> 07:01.380
not healthy.

07:02.089 --> 07:05.050
Some changes must be made around here.

07:05.801 --> 07:08.262
And I need to know what side you're on.

07:09.471 --> 07:10.681
Keep the ticket.

07:11.306 --> 07:12.683
I don't know what you are plotting,

07:12.766 --> 07:16.144
but I'm not up for some cosmic reassessing
of my life situation.

07:16.728 --> 07:19.606
This is Leanne's home now.
She belongs here.

07:20.315 --> 07:23.068
Actually, she doesn't.

07:23.735 --> 07:26.405
Are you seriously gonna try
and get rid of her again?

07:26.989 --> 07:29.241
Do I need to remind you every time
you have tried that in the past,

07:29.324 --> 07:30.367
you have failed miserably?

07:30.450 --> 07:33.704
How did you manage
to pick the worst person imaginable

07:33.787 --> 07:35.497
to be your girlfriend?

07:36.790 --> 07:37.791
She picked me.

07:43.046 --> 07:44.131
I'll go get him.

07:48.677 --> 07:51.013
Just once it'd be great
if you could uphold the bro code

07:51.096 --> 07:52.931
and defend me
when Dorothy attacks my girlfriend.

07:53.015 --> 07:54.099
This isn't about you.

07:54.183 --> 07:56.476
We all know Leanne's weird,
but it's more than that.

07:56.560 --> 08:02.065
She has unusual fucking abilities, Julian.
She can make things happen.

08:02.149 --> 08:05.569
There's like a supernatural link between
her mind and the rest of the world.

08:06.236 --> 08:08.071
She's fucking dangerous, Julian.

08:09.907 --> 08:12.034
- Why aren't you being medicated?
- Un-fucking-believable.

08:12.117 --> 08:14.286
You're acting like
she's a Stephen King creation.

08:14.369 --> 08:15.829
- You sound insane.
- Okay.

08:15.913 --> 08:19.041
I challenge you to watch what's happening
around her over the next few days.

08:19.124 --> 08:22.544
If you still feel like there isn't
something fundamentally wrong with her,

08:22.628 --> 08:23.837
you may medicate me.

08:28.383 --> 08:29.676
You should be on set.

08:30.802 --> 08:32.304
Last-minute schedule shift.

08:33.472 --> 08:34.556
What are you doing?

08:35.307 --> 08:37.893
Dorothy and I thought it might be nice
to have a small party

08:37.976 --> 08:40.437
to meet the new neighbors.
So I'm on my way to meet them.

08:41.313 --> 08:42.313
I see.

08:44.316 --> 08:47.444
You know, you really shouldn't try
and keep things from me, Sean.

09:05.754 --> 09:08.298
- Hello.
- Hi. I'm Sean Turner from down the street.

09:08.382 --> 09:10.634
We're having a get-together,
and I wanted to invite you.

09:12.594 --> 09:14.137
- Well, thank you.
- Sure.

09:14.221 --> 09:16.265
- When?
- Thursday, 7:00-ish.

09:16.348 --> 09:18.267
- Well, I'll tell my wife.
- Wonderful.

09:19.643 --> 09:20.686
Take care.

09:21.478 --> 09:23.063
Could I bring something?

09:23.146 --> 09:25.440
My chocolate-covered strawberries
would make you cry.

09:25.941 --> 09:28.652
No, just yourselves.

09:30.320 --> 09:31.238
Hi.

09:31.321 --> 09:33.198
- Hi, I'm--
- Having a party?

09:33.282 --> 09:35.075
We may have overheard.

09:35.158 --> 09:36.368
Yeah.

09:37.286 --> 09:39.496
Are you guys preparing
for the end of times?

09:41.915 --> 09:43.333
No. Just some comfort food.

09:44.501 --> 09:47.045
Ash says I shouldn't be allowed
to shop at Costco.

09:51.133 --> 09:52.843
So you were saying there's a party?

09:54.136 --> 09:56.763
Uh-huh. Yeah. Thursday, 7:00-ish.

09:57.347 --> 09:58.682
We'll be there.

09:58.765 --> 10:01.560
Great. All right. Well, have a good day.

10:01.643 --> 10:02.936
- Thanks.
- You too.

10:05.981 --> 10:09.026
I might be wrong about the young couple,
but it doesn't matter.

10:09.109 --> 10:11.570
They all said they're coming,
so we'll figure it out at the party.

10:12.362 --> 10:15.199
As far as I'm concerned,
once they're here, our job is done.

10:15.282 --> 10:16.366
Not really.

10:16.450 --> 10:18.702
We gotta figure out who it is
and help 'em out.

10:18.785 --> 10:20.120
You're right.

10:20.204 --> 10:21.830
We'll just ask them some questions

10:21.914 --> 10:24.041
and find out if they feel
like the kind of people

10:24.124 --> 10:26.168
who would buy in this neighborhood or if…

10:26.251 --> 10:28.045
- They're faking it.
- Exactly.

10:29.087 --> 10:31.423
They live lives in ignorance,

10:32.674 --> 10:34.635
plastic smiles upon their faces…

10:40.057 --> 10:42.392
You have to take what you want
for yourselves.

10:44.228 --> 10:45.312
And you can do it.

10:49.066 --> 10:50.150
I'll show you how.

10:58.534 --> 10:59.785
These are mine.

11:02.788 --> 11:04.998
Everything in this book happened
in some way.

11:08.836 --> 11:10.045
When you want something…

11:12.256 --> 11:13.465
put it down on paper.

11:15.467 --> 11:16.343
Sean!

11:17.970 --> 11:19.429
And the answer will come to you.

11:21.932 --> 11:22.850
You just have to believe

11:22.933 --> 11:24.768
- that you deserve it.
- I'll take one.

11:25.435 --> 11:26.937
What is happening out there?

11:29.064 --> 11:31.400
What, do these people live
in the park now?

11:33.151 --> 11:35.320
Why didn't you tell me things
had gotten this crazy?

11:35.904 --> 11:37.781
Well, you weren't exactly talking to me.

11:39.658 --> 11:41.076
Who are these people?

11:43.078 --> 11:45.372
Former members
of the Church of Lesser Saints.

11:45.455 --> 11:47.749
They're all defectors.
They left to follow Leanne.

11:55.257 --> 11:57.176
This madness has to end.

11:58.135 --> 12:00.012
Tomorrow she is gone.

12:00.095 --> 12:02.139
We cannot fail. Not this time.

12:29.625 --> 12:31.001
So sharp.

12:32.753 --> 12:35.839
Isn't it funny how something so useful
can be so deadly

12:35.923 --> 12:37.674
when it's in the wrong hands?

12:47.142 --> 12:48.143
Yeah.

12:49.186 --> 12:50.562
I should lock them up.

12:51.939 --> 12:53.941
Why are you having this party, Sean?

12:57.319 --> 13:00.489
Dorothy's been on her back for months.
She needs social interaction.

13:01.573 --> 13:03.575
And I want my wife to be happy.

13:04.284 --> 13:05.285
Fine.

13:06.245 --> 13:07.579
You keep your secrets.

13:10.916 --> 13:12.543
But I love this family.

13:14.294 --> 13:16.129
And nothing is going to change that.

13:18.465 --> 13:19.466
Nothing.

13:31.061 --> 13:33.480
Sean's cake looks amazing.

13:33.564 --> 13:37.150
I can't believe I'm actually
in Dorothy Turner's house.

13:38.151 --> 13:39.653
- May I?
- Here, let me.

13:39.736 --> 13:41.238
- Thank you.
- Of course.

13:48.078 --> 13:49.788
Hey. You set up camp here.

13:49.872 --> 13:52.416
I need you to keep an eye on this guy,
while I work the room.

13:52.916 --> 13:55.294
No problem. I'd rather be singing
"The Wheels on the Bus"

13:55.377 --> 13:57.838
than have your neighbors ask me
what I do for a living.

13:57.921 --> 13:59.590
What do you do for a living?

13:59.673 --> 14:00.841
Fuck you.

14:01.967 --> 14:05.429
You know, we've seen almost
every episode of your show.

14:07.472 --> 14:08.932
Every episode?

14:09.016 --> 14:10.851
I haven't seen all of them, I'm afraid.

14:10.934 --> 14:11.935
But my wife--

14:13.270 --> 14:14.771
Would you sign this for me, doll?

14:15.480 --> 14:16.481
You got it.

14:19.568 --> 14:21.737
I've seen every episode
of Gourmet Gauntlet,

14:21.820 --> 14:24.239
and you're the sexiest host
they've ever had.

14:25.199 --> 14:26.742
Every episode, huh?

14:27.326 --> 14:29.369
What was the surprise ingredient
last week?

14:30.412 --> 14:31.663
Your tight jeans?

14:32.539 --> 14:34.291
My wife's never been shy.

14:36.210 --> 14:39.421
I have to check on something
in the kitchen. If you'll excuse me.

14:43.800 --> 14:46.303
- I love Helen Beard.
- Oh, y-- Now she's a genius.

14:46.386 --> 14:47.387
Excuse me.

14:47.471 --> 14:49.973
I have no patience for the philistines
who say her work is porn.

14:50.057 --> 14:54.269
You're art lovers? Fabulous.
Who's your favorite Impressionist?

14:54.353 --> 14:55.729
Degas.

14:56.313 --> 14:57.314
Good choice.

14:57.397 --> 14:59.358
I've always been partial to Manet.

14:59.441 --> 15:00.484
What about you?

15:02.986 --> 15:06.907
Suzy's the artsy one.
I kind of like all of 'em.

15:08.492 --> 15:10.577
Curious, what are your thoughts on God?

15:10.661 --> 15:11.870
Really?

15:11.954 --> 15:15.874
If she exists,
I think she has a cruel sense of humor.

15:15.958 --> 15:18.043
Good. Great, thanks. Very helpful.

15:21.296 --> 15:22.297
What?

15:24.424 --> 15:27.761
Wow. Sean's cake looks amazing.

15:32.599 --> 15:33.642
Here you go.

15:33.725 --> 15:37.104
So, important question
since you're new to the neighborhood:

15:38.063 --> 15:39.565
Where'd you buy your fine wine?

15:40.315 --> 15:42.109
We actually make our own wine.

15:43.777 --> 15:45.737
Yeah, all organic.

15:46.321 --> 15:48.323
We have a vineyard out in Bucks County.

15:50.701 --> 15:51.952
We would've brought a bottle.

15:52.035 --> 15:54.830
We just-- We didn't want people
to feel pressure to drink it.

15:56.915 --> 15:58.959
Why? Don't you like it?

15:59.668 --> 16:00.669
Well…

16:03.922 --> 16:04.965
yes.

16:05.924 --> 16:07.885
Sorry, that was weird.

16:10.137 --> 16:13.265
Would you excuse me for a second? I--

16:17.936 --> 16:20.439
You and your wife must be so proud.

16:20.522 --> 16:23.025
We are. It's relaxing
to have boring adult children.

16:23.567 --> 16:25.360
Why did you decide to move here?

16:26.278 --> 16:28.947
Yvonne and I fell in love
with Philly years ago,

16:29.031 --> 16:30.657
and thought, "Why not?"

16:31.742 --> 16:34.244
I got a job offer at Bryn Mawr Hospital.

16:36.413 --> 16:41.210
I didn't mean to Philly, I meant here.
To this street.

16:42.920 --> 16:44.713
Crime's out of control.

16:46.006 --> 16:47.591
I've been assaulted more than once,

16:47.674 --> 16:50.636
and I survived a home invasion
when I was all alone.

16:52.095 --> 16:55.641
God, I can't imagine
what that must have been like.

16:56.683 --> 16:58.477
I'm not asking for your sympathy.

16:59.102 --> 17:01.855
I'm merely pointing out your bravery
in moving here.

17:03.273 --> 17:04.942
Or maybe it's just stupidity.

17:06.734 --> 17:09.445
This is a lovely party, isn't it?

17:28.590 --> 17:30.592
Look for anything from the church.

17:38.141 --> 17:39.309
Next house.

18:26.148 --> 18:28.233
Are any of you churchgoers?

18:29.735 --> 18:30.903
Overrated.

18:32.112 --> 18:34.072
Did any of you ever live on a farm?

18:37.284 --> 18:39.119
What did you think of
that NXIVM documentary?

18:39.620 --> 18:41.914
The Bible, thumbs up or thumbs down?

18:42.497 --> 18:44.416
What's your favorite flavor of Kool-Aid?

18:45.250 --> 18:46.877
When do you think the world will end?

18:47.461 --> 18:49.129
We are terrible detectives.

19:02.935 --> 19:04.478
Are you enjoying yourself?

19:06.355 --> 19:09.900
Indeed. You have a beautiful home.

19:10.609 --> 19:13.654
Thank you. Have you seen the kitchen yet?

19:18.075 --> 19:19.076
Stunning.

19:20.327 --> 19:23.080
Sean must feel like he's in heaven here.

19:25.624 --> 19:27.751
The patio is our pride and joy.

19:28.293 --> 19:30.963
Feel free to step out
and take some night air if you like.

19:45.102 --> 19:46.103
Leanne?

19:47.855 --> 19:50.732
Go check the patio gate,
make sure it's locked.

19:52.943 --> 19:54.278
So you're talking to me now?

19:54.361 --> 19:56.947
Can you do it?
Or do I need to ask someone more capable?

20:10.210 --> 20:14.131
You have such a French New Wave quality.

20:16.175 --> 20:18.135
I'm a photography professor,

20:18.218 --> 20:20.470
and I'm always on the lookout
for new models.

20:20.554 --> 20:22.139
- No.
- You sure?

20:22.764 --> 20:24.224
My rates are competitive.

20:24.308 --> 20:28.562
And just so you know,
my wife and I have an open marriage.

20:28.645 --> 20:30.147
Go away.

20:30.647 --> 20:32.024
Everything all right?

20:36.987 --> 20:37.988
I'm sorry, I…

20:40.199 --> 20:41.366
I thought I felt a vibe.

20:50.667 --> 20:52.044
Thank you for that.

20:52.628 --> 20:54.588
That wasn't to help you.

20:55.756 --> 20:58.050
Why can't you just be nice to me?

20:59.343 --> 21:01.470
Listen and hear me.

21:02.554 --> 21:05.349
We do not have a relationship
that needs mending.

21:05.974 --> 21:07.226
We have nothing.

21:08.393 --> 21:10.854
I've tolerated your presence
only because I've had to,

21:10.938 --> 21:12.814
but I'm not an invalid anymore.

21:13.565 --> 21:16.735
I'm under no obligation to care about you,
and I don't.

21:32.876 --> 21:34.461
This is a disaster.

21:34.962 --> 21:36.964
We need to accept
that our plan has failed.

21:37.047 --> 21:40.050
I will not accept that.
I need her out of here tonight.

21:40.133 --> 21:41.134
How?

21:41.218 --> 21:44.054
We just haven't given them
the perfect opportunity yet.

21:44.137 --> 21:45.597
Everyone's watching.

21:46.139 --> 21:48.183
There's nothing we can do about that.

21:48.267 --> 21:49.268
Isn't there?

21:49.893 --> 21:52.354
Go down to the cellar
and cut the circuit breaker.

21:53.647 --> 21:54.982
Go ahead. Go.

22:14.293 --> 22:15.294
Everyone?

22:17.546 --> 22:18.547
Everyone.

22:19.381 --> 22:22.467
Well,
I thought maybe we could all play a game.

22:22.551 --> 22:24.720
It's a good one. Okay.

22:24.803 --> 22:27.431
So, someone chooses a quote,

22:27.931 --> 22:29.808
and then someone else jumps in
to finish it.

22:29.892 --> 22:33.312
It's-- It can be from a book, or a song,
or a film,

22:33.395 --> 22:36.023
but just so long as someone
can actually recognize it.

22:36.607 --> 22:40.777
Actually, our family used to
play this on trips.

22:41.403 --> 22:43.280
Julian? You wanna give us an example?

22:43.363 --> 22:45.032
I don't really wanna participate.

22:45.115 --> 22:47.034
Oh, God, don't be difficult.

22:48.869 --> 22:51.246
"I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me."

22:51.872 --> 22:54.583
<i>He's just a poor boy
From a poor family</i>

22:57.920 --> 23:00.297
Okay. Well, then I'll go. Okay.

23:00.881 --> 23:02.799
"It was the spring of hope."

23:04.801 --> 23:06.762
"It was the winter of despair."

23:09.765 --> 23:10.766
You go.

23:12.267 --> 23:15.812
Nobody panic.
It's just an old house. Probably a fuse.

23:15.896 --> 23:17.231
Sean!

23:17.314 --> 23:19.358
On it! Hold tight.

23:20.859 --> 23:21.860
Here we go.

23:22.361 --> 23:25.072
- Party favors for everyone.
- Thank you, darling.

23:25.155 --> 23:28.116
- Grab a light. Grab one.
- Thank you.

23:31.453 --> 23:32.913
- Thank you.
- Grab a light.

23:34.873 --> 23:39.294
We also have coffee and aperitifs,
but be careful on your way to the kitchen…

23:41.046 --> 23:42.047
everyone.

23:55.394 --> 23:59.106
What's taking them so long?
We can't make it any darker.

23:59.189 --> 24:01.275
Just have faith, we're so close.

24:01.817 --> 24:04.319
- How do you know?
- Because we did everything right.

24:04.403 --> 24:06.655
They want her. This is nearly over.

24:06.738 --> 24:08.532
It has to be, Sean.

24:09.157 --> 24:11.994
I cannot take another day with her.

24:12.077 --> 24:14.329
If it doesn't work,
we'll try something else.

24:14.413 --> 24:19.084
We won't stop. Not until it's just you
and me and the little guy.

24:21.253 --> 24:22.880
That's all that matters.

24:55.954 --> 24:57.289
What is that?

25:08.008 --> 25:09.051
Jericho.

25:21.772 --> 25:22.814
Lock the cot!

25:23.398 --> 25:24.691
This way. Come on.

25:25.442 --> 25:27.194
Get out. Go. Move!

25:27.277 --> 25:28.987
Oh, my God.

25:49.967 --> 25:51.093
We're a family.

25:54.763 --> 25:57.391
What is it going to take
to make you understand that?

26:51.904 --> 26:52.905
Leanne.

26:58.952 --> 26:59.995
Leanne.
