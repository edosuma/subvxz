WEBVTT

00:01.333 --> 00:03.333
No, we broke out
of your little game.

00:03.458 --> 00:07.666
Wrong. Every step you took to get here,

00:07.916 --> 00:11.000
I paved the road.

00:13.833 --> 00:16.250
HUNTER B-15: People have lives
on the timeline.

00:16.250 --> 00:18.708
They should have the chance
to live those lives.

00:18.708 --> 00:21.125
Jet Skis, Sea-Doos.

00:21.125 --> 00:24.958
- One of these calling your name, Mobius?
- I don't know about calling,

00:24.958 --> 00:26.416
maybe gently whispering.

00:28.708 --> 00:32.458
- That! That's what's been happening.
- Wow. Time slipping.

00:32.458 --> 00:34.916
The branching is overloading
the Temporal Loom.

00:34.916 --> 00:36.000
Temporal Loom?

00:36.000 --> 00:38.708
The Temporal Loom
is the heart of the TVA.

00:38.708 --> 00:41.791
<i>And it's not constructed to weave together
so many new branches.</i>

00:41.791 --> 00:45.041
We need to make the rings bigger.

00:45.041 --> 00:49.458
One of us will have to take our
Throughput Multiplier down the gangway.

00:49.458 --> 00:51.458
And launch it towards the Loom.

00:51.458 --> 00:54.041
I mean, Loki's really gonna
have to hoof it then, right?

00:54.041 --> 00:56.125
Wait. It should be me.

01:00.666 --> 01:03.375
The Temporal Radiation is just too high.

01:03.375 --> 01:05.125
HUNTER B-15: What did we do wrong?

03:04.833 --> 03:08.291
<i>TVA code 1229.</i>

03:08.291 --> 03:10.458
<i>Fail Safe Mode initiated.</i>

03:10.458 --> 03:12.791
<i>Thank you for your service.</i>

03:13.750 --> 03:16.041
No, no, no.

03:16.041 --> 03:17.875
This is not happening again!

03:17.875 --> 03:20.541
<i>TVA code 1229.</i>

03:23.125 --> 03:25.000
<i>Thank you for your service.</i>

03:38.041 --> 03:39.083
Hello?

03:46.416 --> 03:49.666
<i>TVA code 1229.</i>

03:49.666 --> 03:51.916
<i>Fail Safe Mode initiated.</i>

03:51.916 --> 03:53.958
<i>Thank you for your service.</i>

04:26.875 --> 04:27.958
Hello?

04:35.625 --> 04:36.750
Hello?

06:19.875 --> 06:21.875
Is this everything?
- This is everything.

06:21.875 --> 06:24.291
Shh!

06:27.333 --> 06:28.791
Come on.

06:33.333 --> 06:34.333
Come on.

06:56.458 --> 06:58.208
Come on, bro. Come on.

07:07.041 --> 07:08.708
Let's go! Hurry up!

07:08.708 --> 07:11.208
If they catch us,
they're gonna gut us like fish.

07:11.791 --> 07:13.625
Casey? Okay.

07:15.291 --> 07:16.458
Casey.

07:16.458 --> 07:18.000
Thank God you're here.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.250
Is everyone here?

07:19.250 --> 07:20.375
Who are you?

07:21.250 --> 07:22.416
Not again.

07:22.833 --> 07:24.875
Who am I? Casey, it's me.

07:24.875 --> 07:26.291
Tell me you know who I am.

07:26.291 --> 07:28.291
With the boat? You're in the wrong place.

07:28.291 --> 07:30.916
You're not supposed to be here.
Is that the boat guy?

07:30.916 --> 07:32.458
- Do you have a boat?
- A boat?

07:32.458 --> 07:34.333
I don't know anything about a boat.

07:34.333 --> 07:36.500
- How'd you get here?
- How did I get where?

07:37.458 --> 07:39.208
- Alcatraz.
- What?

07:40.000 --> 07:42.083
I don't know how I got here.

07:42.250 --> 07:44.916
That's the problem.
I don't know what's happening, Casey.

07:45.041 --> 07:47.750
Frank, why is this guy calling you Casey?

07:47.750 --> 07:50.125
- I've been calling you Frank.
- Frank?

07:50.250 --> 07:52.166
- You said your name was Frank.
- It is.

07:52.166 --> 07:54.708
- His name's Casey.
- I don't know this guy.

07:54.833 --> 07:56.041
Come on.

07:56.041 --> 07:58.250
You gotta find your own way off this rock.

07:58.250 --> 07:59.333
Sorry, pal.

08:06.916 --> 08:08.250
Come on.

08:38.791 --> 08:41.875
Okay, so we got a good cast
on here for you.

08:42.125 --> 08:45.208
It's gonna help you heal,
but you'll have to wear it for six weeks.

08:46.125 --> 08:47.333
Does it still hurt?

08:47.333 --> 08:51.166
That's good, but do you remember
how bad it hurt when you came in?

08:52.083 --> 08:53.291
That's good too.

08:54.125 --> 08:57.958
But you might forget how bad it hurt
over the next six weeks,

08:57.958 --> 09:01.458
so I'm gonna write a little reminder
on here for you.

09:01.833 --> 09:04.500
Climb... Trees.

09:07.833 --> 09:09.541
That's not gonna stop you, is it?

09:13.666 --> 09:14.833
I tried.

09:14.833 --> 09:16.083
All right, be good.

09:37.833 --> 09:42.375
<i>Wind in the hair,
little mist slapping you in the face.</i>

09:42.375 --> 09:45.541
<i>And nothing but open water
in front of you.</i>

09:45.541 --> 09:48.125
Don? Don?
Your son's calling on line three.

09:48.125 --> 09:49.708
Tell him I'll call him back.

09:51.291 --> 09:53.500
So talk to me. What are you thinking?

09:53.500 --> 09:57.125
Sorry. I, uh...
was more interested in a dirt bike.

09:58.583 --> 10:03.041
Well, they say the personal watercraft
is kind of the thinking man's dirt bike.

10:03.458 --> 10:05.625
Come on,
you ready for your Poseidon moment?

10:05.625 --> 10:07.291
Jump up on this bad boy.

10:07.291 --> 10:09.083
I'm good. Sorry.

10:09.708 --> 10:10.833
It's okay.

10:10.833 --> 10:14.333
Call me if you change your mind
or if you want another donut.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.541
Great donuts today, Dale.

10:26.333 --> 10:27.750
...pay me to put on a helmet

10:27.750 --> 10:29.791
- and ride around in the mud.
- Thank God.

10:30.166 --> 10:31.333
Hello.

10:32.833 --> 10:36.833
- How could he not get up here, Dale?
- Crazy. I don't get it.

10:37.708 --> 10:40.208
You're here?
Oh, yes.

10:40.208 --> 10:43.083
Every day of the week except Sunday,
9:00 to 5:00.

10:45.958 --> 10:48.750
The TVA is gone.

10:48.750 --> 10:52.333
I think you mean ATV, and no,
you're in luck.

10:52.333 --> 10:54.541
We got in two of 'em last week.
They're upstairs.

10:54.541 --> 10:55.666
You don't remember me either?

10:55.666 --> 10:59.125
No, no, I do. You were...
You were in just the other day, right?

10:59.125 --> 11:00.875
Your son's on line three.

11:00.875 --> 11:03.500
I'm sorry, single dad, give me a second.

11:03.500 --> 11:06.000
- Told you I'll call him back.
- Your other son.

11:06.500 --> 11:08.375
Tell him I'll call him back too.

11:24.125 --> 11:25.791
<i>The Zartan Contingent.</i>

11:25.791 --> 11:28.083
I don't think
I've ever seen this one before.

11:28.083 --> 11:30.541
It's really good.
He's one of the greats.

11:30.541 --> 11:31.750
I read everything he does.

11:31.875 --> 11:33.375
Hmm. I'll have to check it out.

11:33.375 --> 11:35.833
I'd hurry. There's only
a few left on the shelf.

11:36.125 --> 11:37.250
Hmm.

11:38.125 --> 11:39.416
It's not reading the barcode.

11:39.416 --> 11:41.916
I can give you cash.
I don't need a receipt or anything.

11:41.916 --> 11:44.000
Yeah, but I have to ring it up or...

11:46.333 --> 11:47.875
Are you buying your own book?

11:48.625 --> 11:49.625
You...

11:50.666 --> 11:53.958
I told you to stop putting
your sci-fi books on our shelves.

11:54.708 --> 11:58.000
Science fiction is a well-respected
and thought-provoking genre.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.125
Nobody buys it here.

12:54.083 --> 12:55.875
What I'm about to tell you...

12:57.083 --> 12:58.791
is going to be hard to believe.

13:00.833 --> 13:04.166
Of course I believe you.
It's a dream come true.

13:04.166 --> 13:07.208
One of my characters has come to life
and needs my help.

13:07.208 --> 13:09.916
This reminds me of
what happens in <i>The Sons of Yoren.</i>

13:09.916 --> 13:12.375
- What's that?
- Just, you know,

13:12.375 --> 13:14.125
my most popular book of all time.

13:14.125 --> 13:16.666
I'm sure I can find you a copy
somewhere around here.

13:18.041 --> 13:19.083
Wait.

13:20.416 --> 13:21.416
You're a writer?

13:21.416 --> 13:23.875
- Yes. Science fiction.
- I'm doomed.

13:25.083 --> 13:27.583
But, and this is kind of embarrassing,

13:27.583 --> 13:32.541
I have to get a PhD to keep my day job
teaching theoretical physics at Caltech.

13:32.541 --> 13:34.708
Wait, you're a scientist as well.
That's great.

13:34.708 --> 13:37.250
Yeah, until I can quit
and write full time.

13:37.250 --> 13:40.666
You have no idea how hard it is
to break... Hey, look at this.

13:40.666 --> 13:42.750
There's a copy. You're one lucky man.

13:42.750 --> 13:45.708
I'm so sorry. Can we just stay on track?

13:45.708 --> 13:50.166
Of course. So, uh, what exactly
are you trying to do?

13:50.166 --> 13:54.333
I need to go back to before
the Temporal Loom melted down.

13:54.333 --> 13:56.375
You can't. It's impossible.

13:56.375 --> 13:58.416
But don't let that stop you.

13:59.333 --> 14:02.541
I don't understand what you've just said.

14:02.541 --> 14:05.041
Well, you time-traveled

14:05.041 --> 14:07.500
- in a place that has no time, right?
- Right.

14:08.041 --> 14:10.333
- That's not possible.
- I know.

14:10.333 --> 14:13.291
So you're traveling to a place
that doesn't exist anymore.

14:13.291 --> 14:17.041
It's equally impossible, and therefore
it's something you might be able to do.

14:17.041 --> 14:19.500
Sure, excellent.

14:19.625 --> 14:21.541
Yeah. Makes total sense.

14:21.541 --> 14:24.541
- Doesn't sound like science.
- No, but it does sound like fiction.

14:27.083 --> 14:29.333
You need to learn
how to control your time slipping.

14:30.875 --> 14:34.000
I can't control it. I can't just...

14:35.291 --> 14:37.875
make it happen. It's, it's random.

14:38.791 --> 14:41.625
But it isn't random
because you keep ending up

14:41.625 --> 14:44.500
around exactly the people
you're looking for,

14:44.500 --> 14:46.000
and it's evolving

14:46.708 --> 14:49.125
because you're not just slipping in time,

14:49.833 --> 14:52.083
you're also moving around in space.

14:52.083 --> 14:55.333
It's like you're a better version
of one of those TemPads.

14:56.208 --> 14:58.250
You make it sound like it's a good thing.

14:58.250 --> 15:01.958
With science, it's all what and how.

15:03.166 --> 15:05.625
But with fiction, it's why.

15:06.666 --> 15:08.791
So, why do you need to do this?

15:10.416 --> 15:12.041
Why do I need to do this?

15:13.458 --> 15:14.583
I'll tell you why.

15:18.333 --> 15:21.625
Because if I can't save the TVA
from being destroyed,

15:22.708 --> 15:24.541
there will be nothing

15:24.541 --> 15:26.541
to protect against what's coming.

15:27.083 --> 15:30.541
Well, if that's the real why
that's guiding you,

15:30.541 --> 15:33.208
you should be able to control it.
So, go ahead.

15:35.041 --> 15:36.958
- Now?
- Yeah, yeah, just do it.

15:38.916 --> 15:40.625
All right.

15:41.666 --> 15:43.583
- Here we go.
- Cool.

15:47.250 --> 15:48.750
Focus in on that why.

15:48.750 --> 15:51.083
- You need to save the TVA.
- All right.

15:54.750 --> 15:56.666
You need to save the TVA.

16:07.500 --> 16:08.500
Anything?

16:11.041 --> 16:12.250
I'm trying.

16:14.375 --> 16:16.541
Maybe you need to try harder.

16:17.291 --> 16:18.833
I'm trying as hard as I can.

16:28.458 --> 16:30.000
You must be doing something wrong

16:30.000 --> 16:32.791
because it really feels like
the time slipping is the answer.

16:32.791 --> 16:35.708
- Maybe we focus on the science.
- Okay.

16:35.708 --> 16:38.875
So this equation proposes that... Argh!

16:39.041 --> 16:40.958
- What are you doing?
- Science.

16:40.958 --> 16:45.625
Now we know that electrical pulses
don't initiate time slipping.

16:46.750 --> 16:49.875
For God's sake.

16:49.875 --> 16:53.416
Ah. Not fight or flight induced...

16:53.416 --> 16:56.625
Okay, let's forget about
the time slipping, all right?

16:56.625 --> 16:59.750
How does science help us

17:00.875 --> 17:03.583
get to a place that doesn't exist?

17:04.541 --> 17:07.041
- Well, maybe it does exist.
- It doesn't.

17:07.041 --> 17:08.958
I saw it disappear with my own eyes.

17:08.958 --> 17:13.250
But then you said you also time-traveled
in a place at the TVA, right?

17:13.250 --> 17:14.500
The Time Theater, yes.

17:14.500 --> 17:18.291
If that's the case, then maybe the place
and time you're looking for still exists,

17:18.291 --> 17:19.958
but you don't know where to look.

17:21.083 --> 17:22.375
Let's try this.

17:27.625 --> 17:28.833
- Hold this.
- Yeah?

17:30.458 --> 17:32.208
We get the band back together.

17:34.166 --> 17:35.625
That doesn't seem very scientific.

17:36.291 --> 17:40.083
You said everyone,
every one of your friends

17:40.875 --> 17:43.333
- has a temporal aura, right?
- Right.

17:43.333 --> 17:47.291
Well, that means a group of people

17:47.291 --> 17:51.833
would have a collective aura
unique to that moment in time.

17:52.458 --> 17:55.416
If we can get everyone together
in one place,

17:56.250 --> 17:57.916
we can read that aura.

17:57.916 --> 17:59.416
It will be like coordinates.

17:59.541 --> 18:02.000
We can use these coordinates
to get back to that moment.

18:03.125 --> 18:05.375
- No.
- Why?

18:05.375 --> 18:08.041
We don't have one of those TemPads
you talked about.

18:08.041 --> 18:10.291
Well, can you build one?
You can build one.

18:10.291 --> 18:13.458
Maybe, but without any of the knowledge
of how it works,

18:14.250 --> 18:16.083
I would have to invent it from scratch.

18:16.083 --> 18:18.291
It could take a whole lifetime.

18:33.916 --> 18:35.500
What if you had that knowledge?

18:36.708 --> 18:38.791
- What's that?
- You tell me, you wrote it.

18:39.541 --> 18:41.583
I did?
- You did.

18:41.583 --> 18:43.625
There's one on every desk at the TVA.

18:44.708 --> 18:47.333
So I am going to write a bestseller.

18:48.791 --> 18:52.458
Yeah, sort of. Let's, um,
let's get to work...

18:55.500 --> 18:57.208
Oh, that's a problem.

19:10.083 --> 19:12.791
Okay, guys,
we're gonna have a new rule,

19:12.791 --> 19:17.250
and that is any toy
found outside your room

19:17.250 --> 19:20.541
is gonna be classified
as garbage, all right?

19:20.541 --> 19:21.791
Trash, okay?

19:21.791 --> 19:23.666
'Cause I'm tired of coming home,

19:24.208 --> 19:29.083
having it look like some lunatic
garage sale that... Is he burnt?

19:30.208 --> 19:31.583
Yeah, he's burnt.

19:32.583 --> 19:34.625
How did he get burnt?

19:35.916 --> 19:38.500
Kevin, who gave you the matches?

19:38.500 --> 19:40.541
- I stole 'em.
- No, you...

19:40.541 --> 19:43.083
Give 'em to me. Come on. Hand 'em over.

19:43.083 --> 19:46.166
Don't run. Kevin. Kevin.
Kev... Kevin! Get...

19:47.041 --> 19:50.250
Sean, go get him! Come on, hurry!

19:50.250 --> 19:53.291
If you keep him from burning down
the house, I'll get you a puppy.

19:53.291 --> 19:54.791
- Come on.
- And a snake!

19:54.791 --> 19:57.625
That... We'll negotiate later. Run! Hurry!

20:00.791 --> 20:02.208
Small victories.

20:02.208 --> 20:03.375
Hello.

20:04.458 --> 20:05.541
- Hello.
- Hi.

20:06.583 --> 20:09.708
Hey. Oh, you were at the shop earlier.

20:09.708 --> 20:12.708
- That's right.
- Yeah. You live around here,

20:12.708 --> 20:14.541
or did you follow me home?

20:14.541 --> 20:20.083
Oh, no. No, no. I was,
I was actually on my way to the...

20:20.708 --> 20:23.291
and I happened to see you so I just...

20:23.291 --> 20:25.208
I just thought I'd just come and say

20:25.208 --> 20:27.500
that I'm sorry I couldn't stick around
back there.

20:27.500 --> 20:30.208
I was, I was in a bit of a time crunch.

20:30.208 --> 20:32.875
Yeah. You were looking for ATVs.

20:32.875 --> 20:35.916
- The TVA.
- Yeah.

20:36.833 --> 20:39.416
You know, are you still in the market?

20:39.416 --> 20:40.750
'Cause I have something...

20:40.750 --> 20:42.791
I got something I wanna show you.
Come here.

20:46.416 --> 20:51.583
Now, ordinarily, I wouldn't dream of
parting with one of these beauties.

20:51.583 --> 20:55.625
But wife is long gone
and I can't ride two of 'em.

20:55.625 --> 20:58.416
Plus, the boys are probably gonna need
braces and math tutors

20:58.416 --> 21:00.666
and God knows what else.

21:00.666 --> 21:04.250
A beautiful union of form and function.

21:04.250 --> 21:07.416
Oh, that's lovely, yeah.

21:07.416 --> 21:10.291
Yeah, they really are
and it breaks my heart,

21:11.000 --> 21:12.250
but what are you going to do?

21:12.250 --> 21:14.166
Hey, you want a drink?
Can I get you a beer?

21:14.166 --> 21:15.958
No, no, no, no. I'm fine. Thank you.

21:16.833 --> 21:20.583
I'm afraid I'm not here to buy a jet ski.

21:20.583 --> 21:23.583
- Oh, what are you here for?
- Listen.

21:24.125 --> 21:27.166
I'm going to tell you something
that's hard to understand, Mobius.

21:28.083 --> 21:30.083
- Mobius?
- Mobius, that's your name.

21:32.083 --> 21:33.291
Okay, I...

21:33.791 --> 21:37.083
- I think you have me mixed up.
- No, you see, the thing is, I don't.

21:37.083 --> 21:41.916
Mobius is your real name
and you belong in a place called the TVA.

21:41.916 --> 21:44.458
Is that right? Huh.

21:44.458 --> 21:46.916
Okay, hold that thought.
I'm gonna go check on...

21:46.916 --> 21:50.375
- It's okay. It's okay.
- I don't want any trouble.

21:50.375 --> 21:53.916
- It's all right. I'm a friend.
- I know you are. I'm a friend too.

21:56.291 --> 21:59.458
What? How did you build a TemPad so fast?

21:59.458 --> 22:03.833
I don't know if I'd say 18 months is fast.
Well, 19 months.

22:03.833 --> 22:07.833
I had to take a break and move out
when I lost my job and my wife left me.

22:09.375 --> 22:11.416
- So what now?
- What's happening?

22:11.416 --> 22:13.250
I promise you this will make sense.

22:23.333 --> 22:25.583
Like... How did you...

22:25.583 --> 22:28.583
Reality isn't what you think it is.

22:30.833 --> 22:33.000
And this isn't the life of the man I know.

22:33.125 --> 22:36.833
I don't know who you know.
I don't understand.

22:36.833 --> 22:39.916
- I know you from a place called...
- No, you don't.

22:39.916 --> 22:42.208
...the Time Variance Authority.

22:42.791 --> 22:45.416
You saved my life when I first arrived.

22:45.416 --> 22:49.625
You saw something in me
that I hadn't seen in myself.

22:51.125 --> 22:52.583
Are you really my friend?

22:54.041 --> 22:55.125
I am.

22:56.166 --> 22:57.250
Who's he?

22:58.916 --> 23:01.416
- Is he my friend?
- He will be.

23:03.041 --> 23:06.291
Why don't I remember that?
- It's too complicated to explain it to you

23:06.291 --> 23:10.958
but I need your help
to save this place, the TVA.

23:11.541 --> 23:15.750
You once told me it was the only life
you'd ever known.

23:17.416 --> 23:19.791
I sell jet skis, man.

23:19.791 --> 23:21.125
Trust me.

23:24.083 --> 23:26.583
- What about my boys?
- They'll be fine.

23:26.583 --> 23:28.125
I can't leave them.

23:28.125 --> 23:30.625
- What do you mean they'll be fine?
- I understand. Listen.

23:31.125 --> 23:34.666
Look, you can come back anytime.

23:36.541 --> 23:40.333
Oh, you were at the shop earlier.
That's right.

23:40.333 --> 23:44.458
Yeah, you live around here
or did you follow me home...

23:44.458 --> 23:47.208
I can bring you back to any point in time.

23:48.208 --> 23:49.916
It'll be like you never left.

23:50.541 --> 23:52.375
Your boys won't even know you're gone.

23:52.375 --> 23:53.916
Yeah, but I will.

23:54.833 --> 23:57.458
All of existence is in grave danger.

23:57.458 --> 24:01.000
- I don't care.
- And your boys are in danger too.

24:03.541 --> 24:07.333
I can't keep them safe unless you help me.

24:11.666 --> 24:16.291
You know, are you still in the market?
'Cause I... Come here.

24:17.875 --> 24:19.250
What were you calling me?

24:20.875 --> 24:22.458
Mobius.

24:25.333 --> 24:27.333
It's a pretty cool name.

24:41.208 --> 24:43.458
This is going to sound strange.

25:49.208 --> 25:51.750
How you doing? I'm Don.

25:52.416 --> 25:55.166
I guess Mobius is my space name.

25:56.208 --> 25:58.583
Are you part of this whole...

25:59.625 --> 26:02.583
saving the... Is this room safe?

26:02.583 --> 26:04.875
- I wonder, for the wormhole or the...
- Yeah.

26:04.875 --> 26:08.583
This whole area is totally abandoned.
No one's around for miles.

26:10.041 --> 26:12.208
So, is this everyone?

26:15.500 --> 26:16.750
No.

26:18.791 --> 26:20.333
There's one more.

27:01.500 --> 27:03.583
This is gonna sound strange.

27:03.583 --> 27:05.375
- I know you don't know who I am.
- Loki.

27:05.375 --> 27:07.458
- Of course I know who you are.
- What?

27:14.833 --> 27:16.916
- You do?
- Why wouldn't I?

27:16.916 --> 27:19.291
Nobody else did. Their lives were reset...

27:19.291 --> 27:20.833
Yeah. I know. I was there.

27:22.708 --> 27:24.625
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

27:25.625 --> 27:28.000
This isn't how I thought
the scene was gonna play out.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.458
No? What exactly were you expect...

27:34.791 --> 27:37.166
Okay, get in the car.

27:37.875 --> 27:40.250
- I'm buying you a drink.
- Okay.

27:42.041 --> 27:44.875
<i>Zaniac craves blood.</i>

27:44.875 --> 27:47.958
However, Mobius's life at the TVA
was taken from him.

27:47.958 --> 27:50.666
So was B-15's, O.B. Casey was a prisoner.

27:50.666 --> 27:52.541
They don't remember who they are.

27:52.541 --> 27:55.208
Their lives matter. They matter.

27:55.583 --> 27:58.833
Yeah, and they're finally back
in their real lives.

27:58.833 --> 28:00.291
That's a good thing.

28:01.541 --> 28:05.041
- Eric, can we get a drink?
- But how many,

28:06.000 --> 28:09.000
if they had a choice,
would have chosen to stay?

28:10.083 --> 28:14.000
Mobius always said the TVA
was the only life he'd ever known,

28:14.000 --> 28:15.250
and he liked it.

28:15.708 --> 28:17.333
It gave him purpose.

28:17.333 --> 28:19.625
It was never his choice
to begin with, Loki.

28:19.625 --> 28:20.916
He Who Remains did that.

28:20.916 --> 28:24.750
But Mobius should have a choice now, no?

28:24.750 --> 28:26.250
Shouldn't they all?

28:26.250 --> 28:28.583
To return to the TVA if they want.

28:28.583 --> 28:31.083
No, you would be ripping people
from their lives,

28:31.083 --> 28:33.458
showing them something
that they cannot unsee.

28:34.375 --> 28:35.583
What kind of choice is that?

28:35.583 --> 28:38.000
But they didn't get a choice in this

28:39.125 --> 28:42.250
and I can't give it to them without you.

28:46.166 --> 28:47.166
You don't care?

28:49.250 --> 28:50.375
I guess not.

28:50.375 --> 28:52.750
I guess this all worked out
the way you wanted it to

28:52.750 --> 28:54.541
and you're fine just walking away.

28:54.541 --> 28:56.708
- It's so selfish.
- Of course I'm selfish.

28:57.458 --> 28:58.583
I want a life.

28:59.375 --> 29:00.666
I want to live.

29:02.958 --> 29:05.166
What's wrong with wanting something, Loki?

29:06.375 --> 29:07.625
What do you want?

29:08.291 --> 29:11.958
- I want to stop He Who Remains.
- No. Wrong. Try again.

29:11.958 --> 29:16.250
- What is it that you really want? Come on.
- I want to save this.

29:16.750 --> 29:19.500
I want to save everything. All of it.

29:19.500 --> 29:21.791
Is it really that hard?
Come on, keep trying.

29:21.791 --> 29:23.416
- I want to save the TVA.
- Why?

29:23.416 --> 29:25.833
- I want the TVA back.
- And?

29:25.833 --> 29:28.000
- What do you want?
- I want my friends back.

29:31.375 --> 29:32.708
Two bourbons, please.

29:33.458 --> 29:35.041
Excellent choice, Sylvie.

29:37.791 --> 29:39.208
I want my friends back.

29:41.791 --> 29:43.125
I don't wanna be alone.

29:45.416 --> 29:47.875
See? We're both selfish.

29:51.958 --> 29:53.125
Cheers.

29:56.333 --> 29:57.750
I know this is hard.

29:58.708 --> 30:00.666
But your friends are back
where they belong.

30:02.500 --> 30:03.875
But without them...

30:07.125 --> 30:08.250
Where do I belong?

30:11.500 --> 30:13.583
We're all writing our own stories now.

30:18.958 --> 30:20.125
Go write yours.

30:33.166 --> 30:35.000
How much longer are we going to be?

30:35.000 --> 30:38.166
Some of us have
time-sensitive activities going on.

30:38.166 --> 30:40.708
Don't worry. We can get you right back
where we got you.

30:41.291 --> 30:42.291
Yeah?

30:43.958 --> 30:46.916
So, that doodad just takes you
wherever you wanna go?

30:47.625 --> 30:49.250
Within time and space, yeah.

30:50.375 --> 30:52.291
- So like a park?
- Yeah.

30:53.291 --> 30:55.208
- Grand Canyon?
- Yeah.

30:58.166 --> 30:59.250
Bank vault?

31:00.500 --> 31:02.375
Do you get out on the water much?

31:03.625 --> 31:06.500
Swimming?
- Yeah, or personal watercraft?

31:07.458 --> 31:10.750
No. I live in the city.
There's not much opportunity, you know?

31:10.875 --> 31:14.291
Well, if you live on a river,
it could be an exciting way to commute.

31:14.291 --> 31:19.583
Or, by the way, it's also nice just to
get out on a pond and unplug.

31:19.583 --> 31:21.333
Hit that reset button.

31:21.333 --> 31:23.958
- Well, I'll keep that in mind.
- Yeah.

31:23.958 --> 31:27.083
Some good financing options available too.

31:27.791 --> 31:30.875
Hey, listen,
if we're all gonna have to wait,

31:30.875 --> 31:33.750
I'm gonna borrow this thing for a bit.

31:38.500 --> 31:39.583
Don't bother.

31:43.000 --> 31:44.000
You should all go home.

32:02.250 --> 32:06.125
- Hey, Lyle.
- Hey. How's my only regular doing?

32:06.125 --> 32:09.083
Oh, yeah, fine. Don't you ever go home?

32:09.833 --> 32:11.166
Well, I like it here more.

32:12.291 --> 32:14.333
Well, I'm glad of the company tonight.

32:17.958 --> 32:20.291
- Rough day?
- Had better.

32:22.041 --> 32:23.291
I got just the thing.

32:28.833 --> 32:30.208
This...

32:31.333 --> 32:35.666
will either cure what's ailing you,
or make it a whole lot worse.

32:36.625 --> 32:39.583
We really need to work on
your sales technique. Thank you.

34:15.666 --> 34:16.833
Sylvie!

35:14.083 --> 35:18.375
You showed up and told each of us that
we're the key to saving all of existence.

35:18.375 --> 35:20.708
And now, what? We're not?

35:20.708 --> 35:21.833
I'm sorry.

35:22.666 --> 35:24.000
I got it wrong. All right?

35:25.083 --> 35:27.791
It was more about what I wanted.

35:30.500 --> 35:31.916
You should go back to your sons.

35:31.916 --> 35:34.833
I know, but that's just it.
You said they were in danger.

35:35.375 --> 35:37.458
So, now they're okay?
You should all just...

35:39.916 --> 35:42.250
go back to your lives.
That's where you belong.

35:42.250 --> 35:45.125
But do I need to go back
to exactly where I was?

35:45.125 --> 35:48.083
What about the TVA?
The TVA.

35:51.791 --> 35:53.083
You're fine without it.

35:55.583 --> 35:58.833
You're all just fine without it.

35:59.083 --> 36:00.833
No, they aren't.

36:03.916 --> 36:05.541
Everything's falling apart.

36:07.583 --> 36:09.416
The branches are dying.

36:09.416 --> 36:11.125
What does that mean?
I don't know.

36:11.291 --> 36:14.416
I don't know what's happening,
but there must be something we can do.

36:14.416 --> 36:16.958
We can go back.

36:18.000 --> 36:19.958
We can stop the Loom from melting down.

36:20.875 --> 36:24.458
O.B., we're all here.

36:25.416 --> 36:26.458
The pens...

36:28.041 --> 36:30.625
We have all the pens.

36:31.125 --> 36:33.083
The mug, the coordinates.

36:33.083 --> 36:38.416
Ah. Okay. First, we need to read
the collective temporal aura

36:38.416 --> 36:41.333
of everyone in this room on the TemPad...

36:42.458 --> 36:44.750
Where did it go?
Hey.

36:44.916 --> 36:46.208
I didn't take it.

36:46.458 --> 36:49.333
Listen, you can rob every bank
you like when this is done.

36:49.333 --> 36:50.875
We need that TemPad now.

36:50.875 --> 36:52.791
Great. But I still didn't take it.

37:03.666 --> 37:04.916
What do we do?

37:09.583 --> 37:11.250
It was a fiction problem.

37:18.791 --> 37:22.333
No, no. I have to go back
to see my boys. I...

37:28.500 --> 37:29.916
Is this it?

37:31.541 --> 37:34.083
We...

37:37.166 --> 37:38.833
There's nowhere left to go.

37:43.666 --> 37:46.333
No. No!

37:47.416 --> 37:50.708
<i>It was a fiction problem.
Everything's falling apart.</i>

37:50.708 --> 37:53.833
<i>No. I have to go back to see my boys.</i>

37:53.833 --> 37:56.208
<i>What's wrong
with wanting something?</i>

37:56.208 --> 37:59.458
<i>If I could go anywhere...</i>
HUNTER B-15: <i>I looked happy.</i>

37:59.458 --> 38:03.166
<i>Wherever it is I'm really from.
The TVA...</i>

38:03.166 --> 38:05.916
<i>Do you think that
what makes a Loki a Loki</i>

38:05.916 --> 38:07.833
<i>is the fact that we're destined to lose?</i>

38:15.083 --> 38:16.458
There's nowhere left to go.

38:27.583 --> 38:29.083
No, they aren't.

38:29.666 --> 38:31.083
Everything's falling apart.

38:31.083 --> 38:32.500
The branches are dying.

38:32.500 --> 38:34.458
What does that mean?
I don't know.

38:34.458 --> 38:37.666
I don't know what's happening,
but there must be something we can do.

38:39.041 --> 38:40.791
I did it.
What?

38:43.291 --> 38:45.458
I did it.
Did what?

38:52.625 --> 38:54.041
I controlled it.

38:56.583 --> 38:58.833
You learned
to control your time slipping.

39:01.708 --> 39:02.708
Yes.

39:04.250 --> 39:08.333
It's not about where, when, or why.

39:19.291 --> 39:20.541
It's about who.

39:28.541 --> 39:30.416
I can rewrite the story.

44:28.458 --> 44:31.500
<i>You died. Insert your coin, loser.</i>
