00:11.300 --> 00:15.350
<i>Long ago, the four nations
lived together in harmony.</i>

00:15.430 --> 00:18.730
<i>Then everything changed
when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

00:19.770 --> 00:23.690
<i>Only the Avatar, master of all

Wow!

01:08.490 --> 01:10.660
We don't have cities like this
in the South Pole.

They have buildings here
that don't melt.

The real fun is inside the city!

01:17.830 --> 01:19.330
Wait, Aang.

01:19.420 --> 01:20.590
It could be dangerous

01:20.670 --> 01:22.170
if people find out you're the Avatar.

01:22.250 --> 01:23.630
You need a disguise.

So, what am I supposed to do,

01:25.670 --> 01:26.930

to bend you over my knee

Hi. June Pippenpadlopsicopolis.

02:53.600 --> 02:54.600
Nice to meet you.

02:56.260 --> 02:58.850
You seem like
a responsible young lady.

02:58.930 --> 03:01.230
See that your grandfather
stays out of trouble.

03:01.310 --> 03:02.310
Enjoy Omashu.

03:02.400 --> 03:03.610
We will.

Good idea.

AANG: This is
the Omashu delivery system...

03:49.110 --> 03:51.360
Miles and miles of tubes and chutes.

03:53.740 --> 03:56.370
Earthbending brings the packages up,

03:56.450 --> 03:58.370
and gravity brings them down.

03:59.370 --> 04:01.370
Great, so they get their mail on time.

04:01.450 --> 04:03.080
They do get their mail on time.

04:03.160 --> 04:06.670
But my friend Bumi
found a better use for these chutes.

04:10.260 --> 04:11.460
Look around you!

04:11.550 --> 04:12.550
What do you see?!

04:12.630 --> 04:15.260
Um... The mail system.

04:15.340 --> 04:17.300
Instead of seeing
what they want you to see,

04:17.390 --> 04:20.390
you gotta open your brain
to the possibilities.

04:20.470 --> 04:22.810
A package-sending system?

04:22.890 --> 04:25.900

the good chamber or the bad chamber?

the bad chamber...

09:47.220 --> 09:49.800
Until the recent refurbishing,
that is.

09:49.890 --> 09:52.010
Of course, we've been calling it
the new chamber,

number them.

14:03.260 --> 14:04.270
Huh?

14:05.310 --> 14:07.060
AANG: There! Enjoy your lunch!

14:07.270 --> 14:09.150
I want my friends back now!

14:09.310 --> 14:10.730
Uh, not yet.

14:10.810 --> 14:12.940
I need help with another matter.

14:13.020 --> 14:16.190
It seems I've lost my pet Flopsy.

14:17.740 --> 14:18.900
Ok, found him.

14:18.990 --> 14:20.030
Bring him to me.

14:20.360 --> 14:22.700
Daddy wants a kiss from Flopsy.

14:22.870 --> 14:24.290
Come here, Flopsy.

14:25.950 --> 14:27.290
Heh heh.

14:27.500 --> 14:28.710
( SNARLING )

14:32.330 --> 14:33.710
Flopsy, wait!

14:33.790 --> 14:34.960
Flopsy!

14:36.050 --> 14:37.260
( LAUGHING )

14:38.840 --> 14:40.010
Flopsy!

14:51.270 --> 14:52.730
Wait a minute.

14:56.400 --> 14:57.400
Flopsy?

14:59.280 --> 15:00.450
( SCREAMING )

15:03.240 --> 15:04.410
Flopsy!

15:11.710 --> 15:14.000
Oh, that's a good boy.

15:14.090 --> 15:16.420
Yes! Who has a soft belly?

15:19.050 --> 15:20.380
Guys, are you ok?

15:20.670 --> 15:23.180
Other than the crystal slowly
encasing my entire body,

15:23.260 --> 15:24.430
doing great.

15:28.850 --> 15:30.480
Oh, yes.

15:30.850 --> 15:33.730
Come on. I'm ready
for the next challenge.

15:33.810 --> 15:36.320
Ah! Ha ha ha ha ha!

15:39.400 --> 15:42.070
Your final test is a duel.

15:42.150 --> 15:44.280
And, as a special treat,

15:44.370 --> 15:46.410
you may choose your opponent.

15:55.420 --> 15:56.590
Point and choose.

15:57.380 --> 16:00.420
So, you're saying
whoever I point to...

16:00.510 --> 16:02.010
That's the person I get to fight?

16:03.180 --> 16:04.760
Choose wisely.

16:06.680 --> 16:07.970
AANG: I...

16:08.720 --> 16:10.220
Choose...

16:10.310 --> 16:11.430
You.

16:11.520 --> 16:13.980
Ha ha. Wrong choice.

16:16.480 --> 16:17.690
( GRUNTING )

16:24.200 --> 16:25.610
Whoa!

16:26.910 --> 16:27.990
Oof!

16:32.790 --> 16:33.910
( LAUGHING )

16:40.840 --> 16:43.630
You thought I was a frail old man,

16:43.720 --> 16:47.430
but I'm the most powerful earthbender
you'll ever see.

16:47.510 --> 16:50.100
Can I fight the guy
with the ax instead?

16:50.180 --> 16:53.980
There are no take-backsies
in my kingdom.

16:54.060 --> 16:55.690
You might need this.

17:02.230 --> 17:04.400
Typical airbender tactic...

17:04.490 --> 17:06.200
Avoid and evade.

17:06.280 --> 17:08.990
I'd hoped the Avatar
would be less predictable.

17:11.580 --> 17:13.790
Don't you have any surprises for me?

17:13.870 --> 17:16.960
Sooner or later,
you'll have to strike back.

17:32.390 --> 17:35.430
Oh, you'll have to be
a little more creative than that.

17:46.320 --> 17:49.200
Did someone leave the windows open?

17:49.280 --> 17:51.780
It feels a little drafty in here.

17:51.870 --> 17:54.540
Are you hoping I'll catch a cold?

18:08.720 --> 18:12.220
How are you going to get me
from way over there?

18:30.990 --> 18:32.780
( YELLING )

18:34.030 --> 18:35.040
Oof!

18:58.600 --> 18:59.850
( SCREAMS )

19:15.660 --> 19:16.660
( SCREAMS )

19:19.120 --> 19:20.370
Aah!

19:23.380 --> 19:24.380
Huh.

19:28.460 --> 19:31.340
Ha ha. Well done, Avatar.

19:31.430 --> 19:34.550
You fight with much fire
in your heart.

19:38.560 --> 19:39.640
Huh?

19:46.360 --> 19:49.110
You've passed all my tests.

19:49.190 --> 19:52.240
Now, you must answer one question.

19:52.320 --> 19:53.610
That's not fair.

19:53.700 --> 19:56.240
You said you would release my friends
if I finish your tests.

19:56.330 --> 20:00.120
Oh, but what's the point of tests
if you don't learn anything?

20:00.200 --> 20:01.830
Oh, come on!

20:01.910 --> 20:03.870
Answer this one question

20:03.960 --> 20:06.920
and I will set your friends free.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.800
What is my name?

20:11.010 --> 20:12.630
From the looks of your friends,

20:12.720 --> 20:15.340
I'd say you only have a few minutes.

20:16.260 --> 20:17.890
How am I supposed to know his name?

20:18.180 --> 20:19.600
Think about the challenges.

20:19.680 --> 20:21.140
Maybe it's some kind of riddle.

20:21.230 --> 20:22.230
- I got it!
- Yeah?

20:22.310 --> 20:24.100
He's an earthbender, right?

20:24.190 --> 20:25.270
Rocky...

20:25.350 --> 20:26.610
( MAN COUGHS )

20:26.690 --> 20:28.230
You know, because of all the rocks.

20:28.400 --> 20:29.440
We're gonna keep trying,

20:29.530 --> 20:30.690
but that is a good backup.

20:30.900 --> 20:33.110
Ok, so back to the challenges.

20:33.200 --> 20:35.070
I got a key from a waterfall,

20:35.160 --> 20:37.570
I saved his pet, and I had a duel.

20:37.700 --> 20:38.700
And what did you learn?

20:38.990 --> 20:42.410
Well, everything was different
than I expected.

20:42.830 --> 20:44.540
And...

20:44.920 --> 20:46.040
Well...

20:46.130 --> 20:49.090
They weren't straightforward.
To solve each test,

20:49.170 --> 20:52.550
I had to think differently
than I usually would.

20:52.630 --> 20:54.130
I know his name.

20:56.300 --> 20:59.970
I solved the question
the same way I solved the challenges.

21:00.060 --> 21:02.140
As you said a long time ago,

21:02.220 --> 21:04.980
I had to open my brain
to the possibilities.

21:05.600 --> 21:08.150
( LAUGHS, SNORTS )

21:08.230 --> 21:10.770
Bumi, you're a mad genius.

21:12.690 --> 21:15.650
Oh, Aang, it's good to see you.

21:15.740 --> 21:18.450
You haven't changed a bit...

21:18.530 --> 21:19.620
Literally.

21:20.370 --> 21:21.660
Uh, over here.

21:21.740 --> 21:22.740
A little help.

21:26.670 --> 21:28.670
Genomite is made of rock candy.

21:28.750 --> 21:29.750
( CRUNCH )

21:29.840 --> 21:30.840
Delicious!

21:31.210 --> 21:34.800
So, this crazy king
is your old friend Bumi?

21:34.880 --> 21:36.300
Who you calling old?

21:36.970 --> 21:38.590
Ok, I'm old.

21:38.800 --> 21:40.260
Why did you do all this

21:40.350 --> 21:42.430
instead of just telling Aang
who you were?

21:42.600 --> 21:43.640
First of all,

21:43.720 --> 21:45.640
it's pretty fun messing with people.

21:45.730 --> 21:46.810
Ha ha.

21:46.890 --> 21:48.310
But I do have a reason.

21:48.690 --> 21:51.650
Aang, you have a difficult task ahead.

21:51.730 --> 21:54.940
The world has changed in the 100 years
you've been gone.

21:55.030 --> 21:58.240
It's the duty of the Avatar
to restore balance to the world

21:58.320 --> 22:00.740
by defeating Fire Lord Ozai.

22:00.820 --> 22:01.950
You have much to learn.

22:02.240 --> 22:04.330
You must master the four elements

22:04.410 --> 22:06.080
and confront the Fire Lord.

22:06.160 --> 22:07.620
And when you do,

22:07.710 --> 22:10.290
I hope you will think
like a mad genius.

22:13.920 --> 22:16.970
And it looks like
you're in good hands.

22:17.050 --> 22:20.510
You'll need your friends
to help you defeat the Fire Nation.

22:22.350 --> 22:24.390
And you'll need Momo, too.

22:24.640 --> 22:26.180
Thank you for your wisdom.

22:26.270 --> 22:27.890
But before we leave,

22:27.980 --> 22:29.850
I have a challenge for you.

22:31.900 --> 22:33.440
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

22:33.520 --> 22:35.320
( LAUGHING )

22:35.650 --> 22:37.070
( CRASH )

22:37.490 --> 22:39.030
MAN: My cabbages!
