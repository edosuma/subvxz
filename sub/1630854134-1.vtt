14:42.299 --> 14:45.802
Good evening.
/'n7 Donna doom/e y, with breaking news.

14:46.344 --> 14:50.057
Transylvania's favorite funnyman,
shecky I/on rathbone, has died.

14:50.140 --> 14:54.853
Shecky was eaten alive last night
by an irate heckler.

14:54.936 --> 14:59.191
Your mama is so stupid, uh, she stared
at a cup of orange juice for 72 hours

14:59.274 --> 15:01.109
because it said, ”concentrate."

15:01.193 --> 15:04.196
You call thatjokes?
The guy got what he deserved.

15:04.279 --> 15:05.405
I gotta get a job.

15:05.489 --> 15:09.743
I mean, working at a mirror factory is
something I can totally see myself doing.

15:09.826 --> 15:10.827
Sexy

15:10.911 --> 15:14.706
the remains of shecky were taken
to the dew drop in funeral home.

15:14.790 --> 15:16.666
- [Chuckles]
- Shecky's death comes

15:16.750 --> 15:19.461
just hours
after the passmg of his brother,

15:19.544 --> 15:23.215
Shelly I/on rathbone,
world-Reno wned astrophysicist,

15:23.298 --> 15:27.135
sometimes referred to as
”the smartest man on earth.”

15:27.219 --> 15:30.806
Silicon carbide grains are present
in refractory inclusions.

15:30.889 --> 15:33.767
A mere child could trace its origins...

15:33.850 --> 15:38.438
Shelly's body also lies in state
at the dew drop in funeral home.

15:38.522 --> 15:41.983
Although, it is unlikely that anyone
but a complete moron...

15:42.067 --> 15:46.488
And I do mean complete moron...
Would ever confuse these two men.

15:46.571 --> 15:51.326
I'm Donna doom/e y, and/ will continue
to bring you the news as it breaks.

15:52.911 --> 15:54.830
I'll stand guard from across the way,

15:54.913 --> 15:58.375
while you steal the second-most
brilliant brain of our time.

15:59.334 --> 16:00.502
Question.

16:03.547 --> 16:06.267
And I know what you're gonna say,
leave the "science-y" stuff to you,

16:06.341 --> 16:11.304
but why don't we steal the first-most
brilliant brain of our time?

16:11.388 --> 16:15.642
Because, my dear floop,
I'm still using it.

16:16.226 --> 16:18.353
Geez. Conceited much?

16:18.436 --> 16:21.273
No. Not conceited at all.

16:21.356 --> 16:24.693
Simply dropping ice-cold facts.

16:28.029 --> 16:30.407
Well, giddyap, little dogie.

16:34.202 --> 16:37.998
And remember, Shelly Von rathbone.

16:38.081 --> 16:40.584
No other brain shall do.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.419
What do I look like, a moron?

16:43.628 --> 16:46.131
Don't answer that. I wrote it on my hand.

16:49.092 --> 16:50.427
Oh, god.

16:51.428 --> 16:53.221
[Electricity crackling]

16:53.305 --> 16:54.431
[Bones clattering]

17:17.662 --> 17:18.747
Nope.

17:21.625 --> 17:22.626
Nope.

17:25.502 --> 17:26.922
Bingo.

17:27.631 --> 17:30.884
Well, hello, Mr. Von rathbone.

17:33.136 --> 17:36.848
Sorry, old boy,
but I'm gonna be needing that melon.

17:38.266 --> 17:40.227
[Sawing]

17:42.562 --> 17:43.647
[Bones crack]

17:43.730 --> 17:45.815

18:09.422 --> 18:12.092
[Melancholic music playing]

19:35.759 --> 19:36.801
[Thunderclap]

19:39.721 --> 19:41.556
[Electricity humming]

19:48.438 --> 19:51.566
Think of it. The brain of a supergenius

19:51.649 --> 19:57.364
transplanted into the body
of a perfect physical specimen.

19:57.447 --> 19:59.532
[Laughs]

19:59.616 --> 20:00.992
So, what are you gonna call him?

20:02.243 --> 20:05.121
Well, I hadn't given much thought
to such trivial matters.

20:05.205 --> 20:07.207
But now that you mention it,

20:07.290 --> 20:12.212
project 27—x-67-h-54 is a bit dry.

20:14.798 --> 20:16.299
Ah!

20:16.383 --> 20:20.136
As I stride this unholy planet
as a modern-day prometheus,

20:20.220 --> 20:24.724
perhaps uranus, god of the sky.

20:26.393 --> 20:29.521
Seriously? Sure making his life
a lot harder than it has to be

20:29.604 --> 20:31.689
with a name like uranus.

20:32.482 --> 20:35.735
Well, I suppose you have a better idea?

20:35.819 --> 20:37.862
Okay, go on. Out with it.

20:39.364 --> 20:40.490
[Sighs]

20:43.284 --> 20:44.911
I don't know. Herman?

20:45.995 --> 20:46.996
Herman?

20:47.080 --> 20:50.708
Yeah. I had a pet spider named Herman.
He was a swell guy.

20:51.292 --> 20:53.336
Hmm. He's gonna need a last name too.

20:54.879 --> 20:58.049
How about munster?

20:58.675 --> 21:02.345
Do you really think
I would call the greatest creation

21:02.429 --> 21:05.890
in the history of mankind Herman monster?

21:05.974 --> 21:10.645
Not Herman monster.
Herman munster, like the cheese.

21:11.271 --> 21:12.856
[Mocking] Like the cheese?

21:12.939 --> 21:16.484
Out of my way, you simpleton.
I've got work to do.

21:21.364 --> 21:26.161
Let's make history, floop! Are you ready?

21:26.244 --> 21:29.789
Three, two, one.

21:29.873 --> 21:32.167
And away we go!

21:32.250 --> 21:34.627
- [Electricity crackles]
- [Dr. Wolfgang laughs]

21:35.920 --> 21:37.881
[Instruments whirring, beeping]

21:41.718 --> 21:45.305
Oh! Oh! I want more volts!

21:45.388 --> 21:47.682
[Shouting, exclaiming]

21:49.893 --> 21:54.189
We need it! We need more power!

21:59.068 --> 22:01.905
Don't do it! You'll kill us both!

22:01.988 --> 22:03.031
[Shouts]

22:03.114 --> 22:04.616
[Alarm system] Warning. Warning.

22:04.699 --> 22:07.076
Give me more power!

22:07.785 --> 22:09.287
Are you insane?

22:09.370 --> 22:10.914
[Laughing]

22:12.373 --> 22:15.376
[Exclaiming, laughing]

22:15.460 --> 22:17.962
Live, I tell you!

22:18.463 --> 22:21.424
Live!

22:22.926 --> 22:24.344
[Laughing continues]

22:27.180 --> 22:30.183
Cut the power, floop!

22:33.937 --> 22:35.980
[Machine powers down]

22:36.064 --> 22:37.857
And done!

22:37.941 --> 22:43.112
My creation is born.

22:50.036 --> 22:51.579
I'm no expert.

22:53.039 --> 22:57.835
In fact, you yourself called me a...
What was that again?

22:57.919 --> 22:58.919
Simpleton.

22:58.962 --> 23:00.171
Right, a simpleton.

23:00.255 --> 23:05.051
So, take this
in the proper spirit, but, uh,

23:06.177 --> 23:08.096
shouldn't he be moving or something?

23:16.229 --> 23:18.481
Interesting.

23:18.565 --> 23:19.732
Anything going on in there?

23:32.328 --> 23:34.872
[Crying]

23:45.550 --> 23:47.677
[Crying continues]

23:51.222 --> 23:53.182
Well, what are you gonna do?

23:55.643 --> 23:57.145
[Floop] It's alive!

23:58.062 --> 23:59.772
Alive!

24:01.608 --> 24:06.613
Ooh, no. Uh, I was talking about
my pet cockroach, Ernie.

24:06.696 --> 24:09.616
You see, I thought he was dead.
But look, he's fine.

24:11.784 --> 24:14.120
- [Squelches, chirps]
- Ernie!

24:14.203 --> 24:16.706
Oh, no, he's still fine.
Tough little bugger.

24:17.540 --> 24:21.336
You have no idea
what this failure means to humanity.

24:22.086 --> 24:25.590
I could have changed the course of life
as we know it.

24:25.673 --> 24:30.553
I could have altered mankind's place
in the universe.

24:30.637 --> 24:34.349
- I could have...
- [Yawns]

24:34.432 --> 24:36.768
Oh, I'm sorry. Am I boring you?

24:36.851 --> 24:38.478
[Groaning]

24:38.561 --> 24:40.313
Well, am I?

24:45.526 --> 24:47.862
[Muffled shouting]

24:49.072 --> 24:52.408
Hey, don't speak, my dear creation.

24:52.492 --> 24:53.993
Don't speak.

24:54.077 --> 24:58.748
Save your words of wisdom
for the grand unveiling. [Laughs]

24:58.831 --> 25:01.250
The world will be watching. [Laughing]

25:02.669 --> 25:06.047
[Host] Live from the beautiful
carpathian mountains,

25:06.130 --> 25:08.132
it's good morning transylvania.

25:08.216 --> 25:12.345
With your host,
the one and only Ezra ll/losher.

25:12.428 --> 25:16.391
Ladies and gentlemen, here's Ezra!

25:16.474 --> 25:18.142
[Ezra] Oh, hello, everybody

25:18.226 --> 25:20.603
welcome back to good morning transylvania.

25:20.687 --> 25:22.355
I'm your host, Ezra masher,

25:22.438 --> 25:24.649
and we are coming to you live from...

25:24.732 --> 25:27.568
So, I really thought you and old orlock
were gonna hit it off.

25:28.820 --> 25:31.155
Maybe you should give him another shot.

25:31.239 --> 25:33.700
All right, so he's a little obsessed
with the black plague.

25:33.783 --> 25:35.326
A man needs his hobbies.

25:35.410 --> 25:37.829
It's not just that.

25:37.912 --> 25:41.207
I want a man that makes my blood run cold.

25:41.290 --> 25:44.460
A man that every time he enters my crypt,

25:44.544 --> 25:48.840
it's like a stake
through my dead, black heart.

25:48.923 --> 25:51.467
I could whip you up a hubby
down in the lab.

25:51.551 --> 25:53.386
Oh, no. Remember what happened last time?

25:53.469 --> 25:55.596
It took us a month
to get him off the roof.

25:55.680 --> 25:58.224
He was batty, but he sure had charisma.

25:58.307 --> 25:59.726
Eh. [Scoffs]

25:59.809 --> 26:02.353
Now, can we change the subject
of my love life?

26:03.438 --> 26:06.691
So, your idiot brother, Lester,
called last night.

26:06.774 --> 26:10.069
Mmm. Let me guess, he's broke again.

26:10.153 --> 26:13.531
He wants me to sell our castle
and cut him in on the deal.

26:13.614 --> 26:17.160
Well, at least he dreams big.

26:17.243 --> 26:20.455
Yeah. His dreams
are my bank account's worst nightmare.

26:20.538 --> 26:22.874
- [Lily] Hmm.
- [Ezra] But before we do that...

26:22.957 --> 26:26.544
Oh, my goodness. We've got
a great treat rn store for everyone.

Dr. Wolfgang,

27:14.175 --> 27:16.844

And kiss my rosy, little [cuckoo].

27:36.364 --> 27:38.491
now that we got that out of the way,

27:38.574 --> 27:41.702
why don't you show us what you've got?

I... I got the situation under control.

31:11.537 --> 31:13.831
I've been working on
some really keen magic tricks.

31:13.914 --> 31:15.332
- Magic tricks?
- Juggling?

31:15.416 --> 31:16.417
[Laughing] Juggling?

31:16.500 --> 31:18.169
Impressions?

31:18.836 --> 31:20.755
Wait till you get a load of this one.

31:22.757 --> 31:25.092
You gotta ask yourself one question.

31:25.760 --> 31:27.094
Do you feel lucky?

31:27.845 --> 31:29.597
Well, do you, punk?

31:29.680 --> 31:31.640
Ooh. I get chills every time I hear it.

31:31.724 --> 31:33.017
I've heard enough!

31:35.227 --> 31:38.773
Oh, farewell, comrades.

31:38.856 --> 31:41.859
Away I must go

31:41.942 --> 31:45.988
to live amongst the beasts and the lepers

31:46.697 --> 31:49.408
of darkest Zanzibar.

31:52.411 --> 31:55.039
The old doc sure isn't cut out
for show business.

31:55.623 --> 31:59.210
Well, it's a little more complicated
than that.

31:59.293 --> 32:03.005
You see, there are unfounded rumors

32:03.089 --> 32:09.136
that I might have accidentally
switched brains in...

32:10.554 --> 32:12.056
Ah, forget it! It's old news.

32:13.516 --> 32:16.477
Floopy, old boy,
I've been meaning to ask you something.

32:16.560 --> 32:18.062
What's that, big guy?

32:20.064 --> 32:23.984
For some strange reason,
I can't seem to remember my name.

32:24.985 --> 32:26.278
Well...

32:27.988 --> 32:30.658
Picture it in lights.

32:31.617 --> 32:38.624
The greatest name in all of show business.

I was assuming he was here
to deliver good news.

34:20.391 --> 34:21.393
You own this joint?

I guess I should have figured that.

Well, I'm close.

with a little more time,

Maybe I should return
to my vaudeville roots.

[Scoffs] No way, man.
This is the wave of the future.

35:08.774 --> 35:10.835

- Yeah. They don't know nothing.

Three lei? Wow! Prices are going up.

42:11.613 --> 42:15.033
You know, that reminds me.
I bought a balloon yesterday.

Good evening, my dear Lily.

42:40.600 --> 42:41.935
That's too uptight.

Yo, what's up?

42:44.438 --> 42:47.607

Don't wanna seem glib. Glib is no good.

Hey, baby doll. What's shaking?

What?

43:08.879 --> 43:11.757
I said, "hey, numbskull!"

43:12.632 --> 43:14.843
Excuse me, sir. Can you speak up?

43:16.052 --> 43:20.223
I assume you are
the Herman munster character

43:23.310 --> 43:25.645
Yeah, I think I'm the only one!

With you in it, I presume?

43:33.278 --> 43:36.490
No! I think I was out by that point!

43:36.573 --> 43:39.159
Wait there! I'm gonna come right...

43:39.242 --> 43:40.368
Down.

43:41.912 --> 43:43.205
Are you gonna come inside,

43:43.288 --> 43:46.458
or do you want to stand out here,
swiveling your hips

43:46.541 --> 43:50.003
like a rabid baboon in heat
for the whole neighborhood to see?

43:50.796 --> 43:52.088
I'll come in!

43:54.549 --> 43:55.675
Why are you shouting?

43:56.259 --> 43:57.719
I thought you liked it!

43:57.803 --> 43:59.346
Why don't you come inside?

44:06.311 --> 44:07.312
After you.

44:07.395 --> 44:08.772
[Shouts] Thank you!

44:08.855 --> 44:10.232
[Normal voice] I mean, thank you.

44:13.068 --> 44:14.194
[Sighs]

44:15.445 --> 44:17.405
- This is for you.
- Oh, yeah? What is it?

44:17.489 --> 44:19.324
It's a bottle of o negative.

44:19.407 --> 44:21.701
The blood lady said
it was a very good year.

44:21.785 --> 44:23.829
- Well, you're very kind.
- Thank you.

44:23.912 --> 44:25.330
The kind I don't need.

44:39.094 --> 44:41.972
Hermie, thank you so much for coming.

44:42.055 --> 44:44.724
I hope you like
curried scorpion casserole.

44:44.808 --> 44:46.434
I made it especially for tonight.

44:46.518 --> 44:49.312
If you made it, I know I'm gonna love it.

44:49.396 --> 44:50.313
[Chuckles]

44:50.397 --> 44:52.983
A matter of fact,
I saved a special spot for it right here.

44:53.066 --> 44:54.442
[Metallic clanging]

44:54.526 --> 44:57.028
- I mean, right here. [Laughs]
- Oh, you.

44:57.112 --> 44:58.238
Oh, these are for you.

44:58.321 --> 45:01.408
[Gasps] Thank you so much.

45:01.491 --> 45:02.993
Lilies are my favorite.

45:03.076 --> 45:05.453
He gives her lilies
because her name is Lily.

45:05.537 --> 45:08.540
We're dealing with
some serious brainpower here.

45:08.623 --> 45:10.750
Father, that's quite enough.

45:11.585 --> 45:13.020
Come on, hermie. I'll show you around.

45:13.044 --> 45:14.671
Yes, Lily.

45:17.507 --> 45:21.094
I beg her to make curried scorpion
casserole, and I get nothing.

45:21.177 --> 45:23.346
All of a sudden,
Mr. Herman munster comes over,

45:23.430 --> 45:26.099
and it's raining
curried scorpion casserole.

45:28.268 --> 45:30.729
[Herman] J” ow! Be-bop-a-luba j”

45:30.812 --> 45:32.647
how low can you go?

45:32.731 --> 45:33.982
[Laughing]

45:34.065 --> 45:36.109
I mean, the songs
just come to me. [Chuckles]

45:36.192 --> 45:37.360
I got a million of them.

45:37.444 --> 45:39.589
I mean, I don't even know
where they come from exactly.

45:39.613 --> 45:41.907
But I got a lot of hot tracks
up in this noggin.

45:43.199 --> 45:44.993
[Gurgling]

45:48.496 --> 45:51.958
You know, father,
Herman isn't just another pretty face.

45:52.042 --> 45:54.753
He's also very, very funny.

45:54.836 --> 45:55.921
Stop.

45:56.004 --> 45:57.923
[Grandpa] Oh, yeah. That's right.

45:58.006 --> 46:01.217
Flattop here fancies himself a comedian.

46:01.301 --> 46:04.721
All right.
Dazzle me with your sidesplitting wit.

46:04.804 --> 46:05.805
[Herman] Okay.

46:07.057 --> 46:09.517
Here's one I know you're gonna love.

46:11.561 --> 46:15.023
How do you keep a grouchy, old,

46:15.106 --> 46:18.568
broken-down vampire in suspense?

46:26.660 --> 46:28.036
[Sighs]

46:29.120 --> 46:30.121
I don't know.

46:30.205 --> 46:35.085
How do you keep a grouchy, old,
broken-down vampire in suspense?

46:38.254 --> 46:39.422
I'll tell you later.

46:39.506 --> 46:41.508
[Sighs]

46:42.842 --> 46:44.803
[Guffawing]

46:49.975 --> 46:51.309
Oh, you.

46:54.270 --> 46:56.523
Okay.
What exactly are your intentions here?

46:56.606 --> 47:00.694
Because, as you can see, I've been around
the cemetery a few times myself,

47:00.777 --> 47:04.864
and you are not going to bamboozle me
with your fancy showbiz fast-talk.

47:05.573 --> 47:07.409
[Chair creaks]

47:09.285 --> 47:10.537
[Sighs]

47:13.206 --> 47:16.626
I assure you, my good man...

47:16.710 --> 47:17.544
[Grunts]

47:17.627 --> 47:21.423
My intentions are nothing but honorable.

47:22.465 --> 47:27.721
Deep inside beats the heart
of a simple country boy.

47:27.804 --> 47:29.472
- [Sighs]
- In fact...

47:30.890 --> 47:34.519
Most of my parts
come straight from the dirt.

47:35.478 --> 47:36.855
Oh!

47:36.938 --> 47:40.942
Did you hear that?
You can't get more grounded than that.

47:41.609 --> 47:44.946
A simple country boy,
straight from the dirt.

47:45.697 --> 47:46.698
Preach it, sister.

47:46.781 --> 47:47.781
[Grunts]

47:50.326 --> 47:52.662
This is a bunch of cornball hooey.

47:52.746 --> 47:54.205
Listen, Herman.

47:54.289 --> 47:57.459
You may have hoodwinked Lily
with your folksy gibberish,

47:57.542 --> 47:59.836
but it ain't working on me.

47:59.919 --> 48:02.297
Okay. We're done here.

48:02.380 --> 48:04.716
Enjoy your scorpion, father.

48:04.799 --> 48:07.177
Come on, hermie. Let's go for a walk.
[Chuckles]

48:07.260 --> 48:11.556
Well, it... it was so nice to meet you
and I hope to see you again soon.

48:11.639 --> 48:13.141
Over my dead body.

48:14.851 --> 48:17.228
- That would be delightful.
- Oh, ignore him.

48:17.312 --> 48:19.564
Come on, hermie. Come on, let's go.

48:20.148 --> 48:21.149
Okay, Lily.

48:21.232 --> 48:23.568
[Lily, Herman laughing]

48:25.070 --> 48:28.281
Hey, by the way.
Your scorpion is undercooked.

48:33.369 --> 48:34.746
Igor.

48:34.829 --> 48:36.164
Sir?

48:36.247 --> 48:39.334
We have to do something
about this situation.

48:41.252 --> 48:43.963
- [Wolf howls]
- [Crickets chirping]

48:47.133 --> 48:48.551
[Both chuckle]

48:50.386 --> 48:51.679
What's that?

48:51.763 --> 48:53.640
Oh, that's one of my gravestones.

48:53.723 --> 48:55.850
Wow! [Chuckles]

48:55.934 --> 48:58.478
Oh, I hope you don't take the things
my father says to heart.

48:58.561 --> 49:00.105
- No.
- He's a bit old-fashioned

49:00.188 --> 49:02.816
and has a tendency
to go straight for the jugular.

49:02.899 --> 49:04.668
Let's hope it doesn't come to that.
[Chuckles]

49:04.692 --> 49:07.028
Oh, I didn't mean it literally. [Chuckles]

49:07.112 --> 49:08.321
Although, to be safe,

49:08.404 --> 49:11.004
wear high-collared shirts
while you're getting to know each other.

49:11.074 --> 49:11.908
-Hmm.

49:11.991 --> 49:15.912
Lily, it-it shall be my mission in life
to get that man to like me.

49:15.995 --> 49:18.748
And when Herman munster
puts his head to something,

49:18.832 --> 49:21.417
Herman munster puts his head to it.

49:21.501 --> 49:24.087
Unless, of course, it falls off. [Laughs]

49:24.170 --> 49:25.880
- Can I confess something?
- Please do.

49:25.964 --> 49:29.467
I knew the moment I laid eyes on you
that you were special.

49:30.093 --> 49:32.428
I understand if you don't feel the same.

49:32.512 --> 49:36.474
I'm just a regular gal
living a boring, normal life.

49:36.558 --> 49:39.686
No, when I first saw you,
my heart leapt from my chest.

49:40.937 --> 49:42.397
If there's one thing I know,

49:42.480 --> 49:47.652
it's that the rest of the world melted
away soon as you appeared in my life.

49:47.735 --> 49:49.154
Oh, hermie.

49:52.866 --> 49:55.326
- After you, my dear.
- [Chuckles, gasps]

[Laughs]

52:20.805 --> 52:23.641
Oh, hermie, it's so romantic here,

52:23.725 --> 52:27.979
with the soft, gentle screech
of the vultures circling overhead.

52:28.062 --> 52:29.522
It sure is, dear.

52:29.605 --> 52:33.234
Unfortunately, the clouds are clearing up
and the sun's coming out.

52:33.318 --> 52:34.318
[Lily scoffs]

52:34.986 --> 52:40.366
Pussycat, this last week has been the most
wonderful time of all of my lives.

52:44.495 --> 52:47.248
Lily?
I've been meaning to ask you something.

52:47.332 --> 52:49.000
Oh, yes, pookie bear?

52:51.336 --> 52:52.587
[Breathing heavily]

52:52.670 --> 52:54.380
Okay, keep it together, big guy.

52:54.464 --> 52:55.548
You're Herman munster.

52:55.631 --> 52:58.593
You got this. You practiced it.
Let's do it.

53:01.679 --> 53:03.348
Lily? I...

53:03.431 --> 53:05.224
What is it? Is something wrong?

53:06.434 --> 53:08.603
Will you m...

53:08.686 --> 53:10.146
[Stammering]

53:10.229 --> 53:11.773
Marry me?

53:13.608 --> 53:15.401
Oh, hermie!

53:15.485 --> 53:20.156
You've made me
the happiest ghoul in the world!

53:22.367 --> 53:25.244
[Grand pa] Everything you ever
wanted to know about magic spells

53:25.328 --> 53:26.788
but were afraid to ask

53:27.455 --> 53:30.792
Igor, there's gotta be a husband spell
in here somewhere.

53:31.626 --> 53:36.381
Are you sure about this?
It seems Ms. Lily is truly in love.

53:36.464 --> 53:38.508
Oh, come on! You know and I know

53:38.591 --> 53:41.135
that we gotta get rid of that bozo,
Herman munster.

53:41.219 --> 53:43.179
- He's got no class.
- Class?

53:43.971 --> 53:47.141
Yeah, class. He's a stitch job
from the wrong side of the cemetery.

53:47.225 --> 53:51.312
He's not the type of person
I want my Lily hooking up with.

53:52.021 --> 53:54.190
- Hamster. Hmm.
- Oh.

53:54.273 --> 53:55.900
Hippopotamus.

53:56.567 --> 53:59.028
Let's see. Husband! [Laughs]

53:59.112 --> 54:01.155
There's a husband spell. [Chuckles]

54:01.239 --> 54:03.991
I really think you should reconsider.

54:04.075 --> 54:06.119
Whose side are you on, anyway?

54:06.202 --> 54:08.663
M/ne's the best one.
It's the most gruesome.

54:08.746 --> 54:10.998
It is not. Mine is uglier.

54:11.082 --> 54:13.918
Oh, yeah .7 I've got the ugliest face.

54:14.001 --> 54:16.295
Whitey,
we 're talking about the sweatshirt.

54:18.131 --> 54:21.467
Sorry things didn't work out for you
so great at the leper colony.

54:23.094 --> 54:25.012
I don't want to talk about it.

54:26.180 --> 54:28.766
Well, at least you came home
with that cool new t-shirt.

54:28.850 --> 54:31.477
They gave it to me
when they lost my luggage.

54:34.730 --> 54:35.773
[Door opens]

54:35.857 --> 54:38.651
Hey, you're back! [Laughs]

54:38.734 --> 54:42.029
It's not a crime to go on holiday,
now, is it?

54:42.113 --> 54:45.241
Huh. You look good. You look good.

54:46.367 --> 54:47.368
Something different?

54:49.829 --> 54:51.080
New hairdo?

54:51.664 --> 54:54.292
Yeah. New hairdo.

54:54.375 --> 54:55.376
Spray tan.

54:57.128 --> 55:00.006
So? How'd it go?

55:00.882 --> 55:02.675
I'm assuming she said yes?

55:05.052 --> 55:06.762
Oh, god.

55:06.846 --> 55:09.307
Oh, I knew it! I knew she was a phony.

55:09.390 --> 55:14.145
Vampire chicks are all the same.
One bite and it's, so long, sucker!

55:14.228 --> 55:17.315
There is always somebody
that spoils everything by chickening out.

55:17.398 --> 55:18.691
She said yes.

55:18.774 --> 55:21.319
That no-good fangbanger...
Wait, wait, wait, what?

55:21.402 --> 55:22.945
She said yes.

55:23.029 --> 55:24.173
- She said yes!
- She said yes!

55:24.197 --> 55:28.367
- She said yes! She said yes! [Laughs]
- [Stomping]

55:30.369 --> 55:32.288
[Grandpa] Let's begin. [Chuckles]

55:32.371 --> 55:33.414
All righty.

55:33.498 --> 55:37.210
We'll start with the chest hair of Tarzan

55:37.835 --> 55:39.253
for that swinging vibe.

55:39.337 --> 55:40.713
There you go.

55:40.796 --> 55:42.757
[Laughs] Oh!

55:42.840 --> 55:45.801
And of course she'll want him
to have some special moves,

55:45.885 --> 55:48.137
so how about a pair of dancing shoes?

55:48.221 --> 55:52.558
One from Fred Astaire
and one from gene Kelly. [Laughs]

55:52.642 --> 55:55.645
And to top it all off
with a little swagger,

55:56.354 --> 55:59.815
a cowboy hat
of the one and only John Wayne.

55:59.899 --> 56:00.900
[Horse whinnies]

56:00.983 --> 56:03.736
Well, how about that?
The Duke did wear a toupee. Huh.

56:03.819 --> 56:05.029
[Laughs]

56:05.112 --> 56:07.114
And now some wizarding words.

56:07.198 --> 56:10.952
Herman munster, dum-dum, will be no more

56:11.035 --> 56:16.499
when you bring the perfect marrying man
to my sweet Lily's door.

56:16.582 --> 56:18.960
[Cackling]

56:23.422 --> 56:24.674
What? What?

56:25.341 --> 56:29.595
[Sighs] Always forget one ingredient.
One simple ingredient.

56:30.096 --> 56:33.266
Here we go. Perfect husband coming up.

56:33.349 --> 56:35.560
[Cackling]

56:36.435 --> 56:37.562
[Shouts]

56:38.396 --> 56:41.649

56:41.732 --> 56:43.732
- All righty, what went wrong?
- [Monkey shrieking]

56:44.068 --> 56:45.069
Hold on.

56:48.781 --> 56:49.865
[Grunts]

This isn't the hair of Tarzan,
it's the hair of cheeta.

56:53.369 --> 56:56.163
- Okay, time to shuffle off to buffalo.
- [Screeching]

56:56.247 --> 56:58.249
Keep going. All right.

57:12.847 --> 57:14.098
[Chuckles]

57:14.181 --> 57:16.309
Wow, hey, you're in a good mood.

57:16.392 --> 57:18.603
Everybody's in a dancing mood tonight.

57:18.686 --> 57:20.062
Is that a victory dance

57:20.146 --> 57:23.065
because you finally got rid of that burn,
Herman munster?

57:23.149 --> 57:24.984
[Lily vocalizing]

57:26.319 --> 57:28.779
Wait a minute, what exactly
is going on here? Are you drunk?

57:28.863 --> 57:30.823
Did that good-for-nothing give you wine?

57:30.906 --> 57:34.452
No, silly. You know I never drink wine.

57:34.535 --> 57:35.661
It's this.

57:36.370 --> 57:37.913
Is that what I think it is?

57:37.997 --> 57:39.832
Yes, it is.

57:40.750 --> 57:41.876
Oh, brother.

57:43.127 --> 57:45.379

[Lester howls]

58:21.082 --> 58:24.001
Herman munster. How's it going, man?

58:24.085 --> 58:26.003
Man, it's going great.

58:26.712 --> 58:27.755
And you are?

58:27.838 --> 58:28.964
I'm Lester, baby.

58:29.048 --> 58:31.133
Ah, Lester baby.

58:31.217 --> 58:32.968
Your future brother-in-law.

58:33.469 --> 58:36.055
I'm the one who pointed Lily
directly to your door.

58:36.138 --> 58:40.518
If not for me,
who knows if love would have bloomed?

58:41.143 --> 58:43.938
[Laughs] It is so great to meet you.

58:44.021 --> 58:45.272
So, listen, Herman.

58:45.356 --> 58:47.358
Now that you and I
are practically blood-related,

58:47.441 --> 58:51.278
I think it's only right that I tell you
about this sweetheart real estate deal.

58:52.154 --> 58:54.865
That sounds boss, man. [Laughs]

58:54.949 --> 58:58.703
But I think it's best
if Lily handles the finances.

58:58.786 --> 59:00.663
'Cause I don't have a head for numbers.

59:00.746 --> 59:02.498
Come on, Herman. Get with it.

59:02.581 --> 59:05.918
You gotta get ahead of the curve
if you wanna swerve.

59:06.001 --> 59:08.295
[Laughing] Oh, yeah.

59:09.213 --> 59:10.214
What do you mean?

59:10.297 --> 59:13.008
Now that you and my lovely sister
are tying the knot,

59:13.092 --> 59:15.594
what's hers is yours, right?

59:16.679 --> 59:17.847
Well, you do have a point.

59:22.685 --> 59:24.854
I assume you are the man of the house,
right?

59:24.937 --> 59:27.189
Yeah, well, I guess I am.

59:27.273 --> 59:29.233
You guess? Come on, brother, man.

59:29.316 --> 59:31.068
Stick that chest straight out.

59:31.152 --> 59:33.070
- I am the man of the house.
- [Stomping]

59:33.154 --> 59:34.154
That's the spirit.

59:34.196 --> 59:35.823
Just sign on the dotted line,

59:35.906 --> 59:39.994
and you and your lovely bride
will be residing on easy street.

59:40.077 --> 59:42.997
[Laughing] Goody.

59:43.080 --> 59:47.543

Please proceed with the vows.

01:00:49.063 --> 01:00:50.606
Dearest Lily,

01:00:51.398 --> 01:00:53.984
you're the hemlock in my veins.

01:00:54.068 --> 01:00:55.653
The cobweb in my brains.

01:00:56.695 --> 01:01:00.282
I wanna boogie oogie oogie
till we just can't boogie no more.

01:01:02.159 --> 01:01:04.453

[Joints crack]

01:01:07.331 --> 01:01:11.168
I knew from the moment
I saw your flat head

01:01:11.252 --> 01:01:13.754
and that cute, little scar,

01:01:14.463 --> 01:01:19.677
that I wanted to spend every moment
tightening those neck bolts.

01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:20.803
- [Joints crack]
- [Moans]

01:01:20.886 --> 01:01:24.431
All I ask is that we spend
the rest of my lives

01:01:24.515 --> 01:01:27.518
growing disgracefully old together.

01:01:28.102 --> 01:01:29.102
[Chuckles]

01:01:30.104 --> 01:01:32.481

Here. [Chuckles]

01:01:40.030 --> 01:01:42.157
- Yo-yo. [Chuckles]
- Yo-yo.

01:01:43.117 --> 01:01:46.370
Oh, there they are. [Chuckles]

01:01:46.453 --> 01:01:47.454
Oh!

01:01:47.538 --> 01:01:51.584
Herman, do you take Lily crucilla
to be your lawfully wedded wife,

01:01:51.667 --> 01:01:54.712
- until a stake to the heart do you part?
- [Sniffles]

01:01:55.754 --> 01:01:57.256
What a cream puff.

01:01:58.549 --> 01:02:01.176
- [I do. Uaughs]
- Oh.

01:02:07.725 --> 01:02:11.270
Lily cru... crucilla, do you take Herman...
Herman munster as your...

01:02:11.353 --> 01:02:14.690
Your husband,
until a loss of electricity do you part?

01:02:14.773 --> 01:02:17.067
I do.

01:02:20.195 --> 01:02:23.866
If anyone objects to the marriage
of these two wretched souls,

01:02:23.949 --> 01:02:27.036
- speak now or forever hold your peace.
- Yeah...

01:02:29.788 --> 01:02:32.833
I... I was just gonna say good luck.
[Chuckles]

01:02:32.917 --> 01:02:35.336

Pardon me. Can someone please call 911?

01:03:03.697 --> 01:03:04.698
Come on, hermie.

01:03:04.782 --> 01:03:07.409
Mrs. Munster wants to start her new life.

01:03:07.493 --> 01:03:09.828
- Mrs. Munster.

[Howls]

01:04:01.338 --> 01:04:03.215
[Burps] Did I miss the wedding?

01:04:03.298 --> 01:04:05.551
As a matter of fact, you did.

01:04:05.634 --> 01:04:10.222
Well, then let me take this opportunity

01:04:10.305 --> 01:04:13.809
to congratulate my baby sister.

01:04:14.393 --> 01:04:16.770
And, um, my new partner.

01:04:17.354 --> 01:04:18.355
Scram.

01:04:18.439 --> 01:04:20.107

[Burps]

01:04:27.614 --> 01:04:30.492
That Lester. What a character.
Gotta love him.

01:04:30.576 --> 01:04:33.871
Hmm. What exactly
was Lester talking about?

01:04:33.954 --> 01:04:35.581
You didn't give him money, did you?

01:04:35.664 --> 01:04:37.708
Money? No. He's just tipsy.

01:04:37.791 --> 01:04:39.991
You know how wolves get
after a few too many. [Chuckles]

01:04:40.044 --> 01:04:42.755
I know my sweet, adorable hermie baby

01:04:42.838 --> 01:04:46.675
wouldn't be dumb enough to get into
a lamebrain business scheme with Lester.

01:04:46.759 --> 01:04:50.721
[Laughing] Business? With Lester?
Don't be ridiculous.

01:04:51.346 --> 01:04:56.268
Good. I would hate to think I just
threw my life away marrying a blockhead.

01:04:58.479 --> 01:05:02.524
The castle is now officially yours.

01:05:02.608 --> 01:05:03.609

[Howling]

01:05:08.155 --> 01:05:12.576
Ah, it appears your brother-in-law
is as stupid in the brain as you.

01:05:12.659 --> 01:05:14.953
[Laughs]

01:05:15.037 --> 01:05:16.580
What about my green?

01:05:21.293 --> 01:05:22.503
That's it?

01:05:22.586 --> 01:05:25.422
That is what is left for you
after our cut.

01:05:25.506 --> 01:05:30.052
My advice to you:
Don't borrow money from zoya.

01:05:30.135 --> 01:05:33.555
Trust me, you ain't never seeing me again.

01:05:33.639 --> 01:05:36.266
Next time we won't be so hospitable.

01:05:36.350 --> 01:05:37.476
Won't be no next time!

01:05:37.559 --> 01:05:39.228
I'm going straight to Las Vegas.

01:05:39.311 --> 01:05:42.064
So I can quadruple my pitiful stack.

01:05:42.147 --> 01:05:43.732
[Chuckles]

01:05:43.816 --> 01:05:46.735
- Wolf never learn.
- Wolf is stupid.

01:05:58.747 --> 01:05:59.748
Merci!

01:06:01.667 --> 01:06:02.668
Oh, look up there.

01:06:03.627 --> 01:06:04.962
Tre's magnifl'que.

01:06:05.045 --> 01:06:06.964

01:06:07.047 --> 01:06:09.299
[Laughing]

01:06:15.264 --> 01:06:19.268
I hate to say it,
but old Paris is overrated.

01:06:21.478 --> 01:06:25.315
These are some of the homeliest people
I've ever seen. [Chuckles]

01:06:25.399 --> 01:06:27.234
I noticed that too.

01:06:27.317 --> 01:06:30.028
And they sure have a funny way
of reacting to foreigners.

01:06:30.737 --> 01:06:32.739
Some of these customs seem downright rude.

01:06:32.823 --> 01:06:35.159
Well, wait a second.

01:06:36.368 --> 01:06:40.080
I almost forgot.
I think this will solve our problem.

01:06:41.707 --> 01:06:42.791
[Chuckles]

01:06:42.875 --> 01:06:45.502
We'll have no trouble blending in.

01:06:45.586 --> 01:06:51.592
[Gasps] Oh, pookie!
You look so continental and suave.

01:06:52.217 --> 01:06:55.804
I hope they don't confuse me
for Maurice chevalier.

01:07:37.137 --> 01:07:38.263
Hey, look, a mime.

01:07:40.307 --> 01:07:42.434
That's the height of French culture.
Very classy.

01:07:42.517 --> 01:07:45.395
Well, right about now
I think I could use some culture.

01:07:51.109 --> 01:07:53.362

01:08:17.051 --> 01:08:18.095
I don't get it.

01:08:18.761 --> 01:08:20.471
That's the loudest mime I've ever seen.

01:08:20.555 --> 01:08:23.600
Must be that new modern mime
I was reading about.

01:08:23.684 --> 01:08:25.310
[Chuckles]

01:08:25.394 --> 01:08:26.603
Oh, hermie, look!

01:08:30.607 --> 01:08:33.527
Oh, he's so cute! What a sweetie!

01:08:34.152 --> 01:08:35.404
What's it say?

[Speaks French]

01:08:37.613 --> 01:08:38.740
Huh?

Monster haunts the sewers of Paris.

01:08:41.285 --> 01:08:42.286
Oh. [Chuckles]

01:08:42.368 --> 01:08:44.412
Oh, goody! Let's go!

01:08:44.496 --> 01:08:46.331
What a fun town!

01:08:46.415 --> 01:08:47.749

01:08:49.167 --> 01:08:50.794
[Herman laughs]

01:09:11.064 --> 01:09:12.691
This is so romantic.

01:09:13.442 --> 01:09:15.152
It reminds me of the old neighborhood.

01:09:15.777 --> 01:09:17.988
I'm surprised it's so empty.

01:09:18.071 --> 01:09:20.282
I thought it would be crawling
with tourists.

01:09:22.451 --> 01:09:24.243
Well, this is why it's empty.

01:09:25.287 --> 01:09:26.287
It's closed.

01:09:27.788 --> 01:09:30.334
I so wanted to find that little cutie.

01:09:32.877 --> 01:09:33.879

01:09:41.261 --> 01:09:42.470
[Joints crack]

01:09:44.014 --> 01:09:45.974
[Grunting]

01:09:52.731 --> 01:09:53.899
[Sighs]

01:09:56.777 --> 01:10:00.155
Oh, hermie, you're so manly.

01:10:02.741 --> 01:10:04.368
[Chuckles]

01:10:04.451 --> 01:10:06.411
After you. [Chuckles]

01:10:09.289 --> 01:10:11.124
[Both chuckling]

01:10:17.089 --> 01:10:18.840
Oh, I think I hear something.

01:10:23.428 --> 01:10:25.013
[Creature snarls]

01:10:25.097 --> 01:10:26.890
There it goes!

01:10:26.973 --> 01:10:28.183
[Lily gasps]

01:10:32.437 --> 01:10:34.481
- [Herman laughing]
- [Creature growls]

01:10:37.943 --> 01:10:39.361
[Laughing] He looks hungry.

01:10:39.444 --> 01:10:40.487
Herman?

01:10:41.238 --> 01:10:42.739
[Growling continues]

01:10:42.823 --> 01:10:43.824
Herman?

01:10:45.826 --> 01:10:47.536
[Herman laughing]

01:10:51.706 --> 01:10:53.375
- He's a cutie.
- [Creature growling]

01:10:55.627 --> 01:10:57.963
Oh, he's adorable!

01:10:58.046 --> 01:11:00.215
- [Herman laughs]
- [Creature growls]

01:11:00.924 --> 01:11:03.593
[Bell tolling]

01:11:04.302 --> 01:11:06.513
[Grandpa] Wow. Boy, oh, boy.

01:11:07.389 --> 01:11:11.017
Boy, that is nice.
That is very, very nice.

01:11:12.102 --> 01:11:13.228
How?

01:11:13.311 --> 01:11:15.772
Look at this neck.
It's completely natural.

01:11:16.523 --> 01:11:18.275
Yeah, boy. Look at that.

01:11:18.358 --> 01:11:19.568
[Wolf whistle]

01:11:19.651 --> 01:11:23.029
- That's what I say.
- I'm really a leg man myself.

01:11:23.613 --> 01:11:25.991
Preferably two, if p-possible.

01:11:28.702 --> 01:11:31.079
- What's that?
- Special delivery, my lord.

01:11:31.872 --> 01:11:33.999
From zoya krupp-p-p.

01:11:35.250 --> 01:11:36.250
Zoya krupp?

01:11:37.043 --> 01:11:38.837
Why does that name sound familiar?

01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:40.755
I believe you were once married.

01:11:40.839 --> 01:11:43.550
You know what, Igor?
You're right. I was married.

01:11:43.633 --> 01:11:46.887
Let me tell you something.
I really dodged a stake with this one.

01:11:46.970 --> 01:11:49.014
Yeah, she was a little wacky.

01:11:49.097 --> 01:11:51.850
And she swore she would get revenge on me.

01:11:51.933 --> 01:11:55.353
But, you know, they all say that. [Laughs]

01:11:57.272 --> 01:11:59.065
My dear count,

01:11:59.691 --> 01:12:04.738
as you once broke zoya's heart,
I now return the favor.

01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:08.742
Enjoy being a peasant. [Chuckles]

01:12:08.825 --> 01:12:10.494
[Screams]

01:12:10.577 --> 01:12:11.786
Good news?

01:12:11.870 --> 01:12:13.079
We're being evicted!

01:12:13.163 --> 01:12:16.124
How is this p-p-possible?

01:12:16.208 --> 01:12:21.796
Because I have a complete numbskull
for a son-in-law!

01:12:23.048 --> 01:12:25.050
[Speaking French]

01:12:27.761 --> 01:12:30.096
[French continues]

01:12:32.724 --> 01:12:33.724
Huh?

01:12:35.644 --> 01:12:37.729
[Singsongy] Lily!

01:12:38.355 --> 01:12:44.277
Your lover boy, Herman, is getting lonely!

01:12:44.361 --> 01:12:47.113
Almost ready, pookie bear!

01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:02.712
How's the newest member
of our family doing?

01:13:04.506 --> 01:13:07.467
He's being just as cute as can be.

01:13:07.551 --> 01:13:09.302
[Gasps] What should we name him?

01:13:09.386 --> 01:13:11.721
I was thinking spot.

01:13:11.805 --> 01:13:14.516
[Gasps] You know, he looks like a spot.

01:13:23.441 --> 01:13:24.859
[Knocking]

01:13:24.943 --> 01:13:28.154
Oh. Oh, goody.
That's the champagne I ordered.

01:13:28.738 --> 01:13:31.408
Room service at this hotel is terrible.

01:13:31.491 --> 01:13:34.578
Every time I order something, they just
throw it at me from across the hall.

01:13:34.661 --> 01:13:38.665
Oh, Herman. You have to remember,
we're not in transylvania anymore.

01:13:38.748 --> 01:13:40.500
They do things differently over here.

01:13:40.584 --> 01:13:42.002
Tell me about it.

01:13:42.502 --> 01:13:47.007
I can't follow the plot to this
Woody woodpecker cartoon to save my life.

01:13:48.341 --> 01:13:49.342
[Chuckles]

01:13:49.426 --> 01:13:51.344
[Speaking French]

01:13:52.679 --> 01:13:54.472
[Knocks on door]

01:13:59.019 --> 01:14:00.353
Bonjour, mademoiselle.

01:14:03.607 --> 01:14:05.317
[Knocks slowly]

01:14:11.489 --> 01:14:12.532
Merci beaucoup.

01:14:26.087 --> 01:14:28.006
Sweetie, I'm ready.

01:14:29.716 --> 01:14:31.468
[Gasps] Father!

01:14:32.719 --> 01:14:33.720
What's going on?

01:14:34.387 --> 01:14:37.974
This half-wit, blockhead dummy you married

01:14:38.058 --> 01:14:41.978
just signed over our castle
to my crazy ex, zoya.

01:14:42.062 --> 01:14:43.104
{gasps}

01:14:44.814 --> 01:14:47.567
well, let's just say
that if I didn't swerve then...

01:14:47.651 --> 01:14:51.821
No, wait.
If I don't curve, then I don't swerve.

01:14:51.905 --> 01:14:55.659
Oh, Herman. How could you let Lester
drag you into this?

01:14:55.742 --> 01:14:59.996
Yeah, now thanks to swervy-curvy here,
we are effectively homeless!

01:15:02.332 --> 01:15:04.125
Well, there's only one thing left to do.

01:15:05.126 --> 01:15:06.127
What's that?

01:15:07.003 --> 01:15:09.798
I'm gonna hold my breath
until we get the castle back.

01:15:11.549 --> 01:15:13.218
[Grunting]

01:15:13.301 --> 01:15:14.552
What are we going to do?

01:15:15.845 --> 01:15:18.056
Who's that lawyer
that's always advertising

01:15:18.139 --> 01:15:19.808
in the back of the transylvania gazette?

01:15:19.891 --> 01:15:22.519
The one that says he can win any case.

01:15:22.602 --> 01:15:24.938
Shady magoon. I know him.

01:15:25.021 --> 01:15:29.901
There's not an honest bone in his body.
He's untrustworthy, unethical and immoral.

01:15:29.984 --> 01:15:33.029
Good. I will give him a call
when we get back.

01:15:33.863 --> 01:15:35.532
[Groans]

01:15:36.825 --> 01:15:38.910
[Laughing]

01:15:46.418 --> 01:15:48.378
[Wolf howls]

01:15:49.170 --> 01:15:51.923

01:16:02.183 --> 01:16:03.977
[laughs]

01:16:05.395 --> 01:16:07.939
[Indistinct shouting on phone]

01:16:08.022 --> 01:16:09.482
So you've looked at our case.

01:16:12.193 --> 01:16:13.027
[Chuckles]

01:16:13.111 --> 01:16:15.113
[Speaking Hungarian]

01:16:15.905 --> 01:16:18.032
Right. Okay, lightning.

01:16:23.705 --> 01:16:25.457
Yes, I understand. Shark.

01:16:25.540 --> 01:16:26.583
Oh!

01:16:28.376 --> 01:16:29.419
Right.

01:16:30.003 --> 01:16:32.589
Lunar eclipse.

01:16:32.672 --> 01:16:33.798
[Shouting continues]

01:16:35.508 --> 01:16:37.761
Well, thank you.

01:16:37.844 --> 01:16:40.180
Hey, that sounded promising.
What did they say?

01:16:40.263 --> 01:16:42.682
We have a better chance
of being struck by lightning

01:16:42.766 --> 01:16:45.351
while being attacked by a shark
during a lunar eclipse.

01:16:45.435 --> 01:16:49.147
In other words, we have no case.
What are we going to do?

01:16:49.230 --> 01:16:52.025
[Chuckles] Why don't you ask
magna-cum-dum-dum over there

01:16:52.108 --> 01:16:53.193
what we're gonna do?

01:16:53.276 --> 01:16:55.904
He's the one who got us into this mess.

01:16:55.987 --> 01:16:57.489
For / am zombo.

01:16:57.572 --> 01:17:01.576
The most handsome man
in Hollywood, California.

01:17:01.659 --> 01:17:03.661
- Herman?
- [Laughing]

01:17:03.745 --> 01:17:05.413
Herman munster.

01:17:06.456 --> 01:17:07.457
Did you hear that?

01:17:08.041 --> 01:17:09.042
Hear what?

01:17:09.125 --> 01:17:10.543
Hollywood, California.

01:17:11.586 --> 01:17:13.004
I was thinking.

01:17:13.087 --> 01:17:17.133
Please, please, please, do us a favor.
No more thinking.

01:17:17.217 --> 01:17:20.261
As I was saying
before I was so rudely interrupted,

01:17:21.095 --> 01:17:25.725
if that guy's a star, imagine what'll
happen when they get a look at me.

01:17:26.309 --> 01:17:29.145
I'm a ten. Zombo's a seven, at best.

01:17:29.229 --> 01:17:31.815
That man on the boob tube
has actual talent.

01:17:31.898 --> 01:17:34.609
Oh, Herman, you can't be serious.

01:17:34.692 --> 01:17:38.154
I don't wanna leave our beloved
home country and move to tinseltown.

01:17:38.238 --> 01:17:40.073
Crumble creature crackers.

01:17:40.156 --> 01:17:42.116
As head of this household, I've decided.

01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:44.118
Take it out of the box like this.

01:17:44.202 --> 01:17:46.454
The munsters have outgrown transylvania.

01:17:46.538 --> 01:17:48.998
And then you destroy it in the bowl.

01:17:49.082 --> 01:17:51.626
- Uh... [clears throat] What about me?
- What about you?

01:17:52.627 --> 01:17:56.339
Lily. You're not gonna let
your lamebrain husband

01:17:56.422 --> 01:18:00.510
abandon your poor,
old, broken-down father.

01:18:00.593 --> 01:18:02.303
Oh, of course not.

01:18:03.137 --> 01:18:04.347
Herman.

01:18:04.430 --> 01:18:06.224
- Okay, you can come too.
- [Laughs]

01:18:06.307 --> 01:18:08.393
But all yourjunk stays here
in transylvania.

01:18:08.476 --> 01:18:10.937
Including that freeloading Igor.

01:18:11.020 --> 01:18:12.105
[Plays notes]

01:18:12.188 --> 01:18:13.189
No offense.

01:18:13.273 --> 01:18:14.440
None taken.

01:18:14.524 --> 01:18:15.358
[Whimpers]

01:18:15.441 --> 01:18:16.651
This is a fresh start.

01:18:17.277 --> 01:18:18.945
All you get is one box.

01:18:19.028 --> 01:18:21.030
One box is all I need.

01:18:22.991 --> 01:18:26.536
[All laughing]

01:18:31.624 --> 01:18:34.460
[Wolf howling]

01:18:34.544 --> 01:18:37.005
[Grandpa] Perfect. Perfect.

01:18:37.088 --> 01:18:41.593
Well, Igor. This is gonna put
a little flutter in your wings.

01:18:41.676 --> 01:18:43.553
[Laughs]

01:18:44.596 --> 01:18:46.472
Are you sure about this, sir?

01:18:46.556 --> 01:18:48.433
I'm getting on a bit in age,

01:18:48.516 --> 01:18:53.521
and I could suffer from the side effects
of the transformation.

01:18:53.605 --> 01:18:56.316
Oh, come on. What's a couple side effects?

01:18:56.399 --> 01:18:59.027
Um... perhaps I should stay.

01:18:59.110 --> 01:19:03.865
I noticed lord grimsby
is canvassing for a new pool boy.

01:19:03.948 --> 01:19:07.410
Trust me, grimsby manor has no pool.

01:19:07.493 --> 01:19:08.912
Then why would he...

01:19:08.995 --> 01:19:11.205
Look, do you wanna go to america
with me or not?

01:19:11.289 --> 01:19:14.500
Well... yeah.

01:19:14.584 --> 01:19:15.668
[Chuckles]

01:19:15.752 --> 01:19:16.961
Bottoms up.

01:19:17.045 --> 01:19:19.923
Oh, that's what lord grimsby said.
[Chuckles]

01:19:24.636 --> 01:19:26.262
[Coughing]

01:19:27.430 --> 01:19:28.890
[Blowing rapidly]

01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:32.518
[Grunting, blows raspberry]

01:19:32.602 --> 01:19:33.895
[Babbling]

01:19:35.438 --> 01:19:36.648
It's not working.

01:19:39.275 --> 01:19:40.276
[Sq uawks]

01:19:42.987 --> 01:19:46.449
Something homey, with an old-world flair.

01:19:46.532 --> 01:19:49.702
Preferably a tomb with a view.
That would be nice.

01:19:49.786 --> 01:19:53.539
Tell her nothing too showy. We don't
wanna be the talk of the neighborhood.

01:19:54.123 --> 01:19:56.292
It'll be bad enough
once they get a look at me.

01:19:56.918 --> 01:19:58.586
Paparazzi will be everywhere.

01:19:58.670 --> 01:20:00.088
Oh, I agree.

01:20:00.171 --> 01:20:04.217
Yes, nothing too showy. We're just
your typical family looking to blend in.

01:20:04.300 --> 01:20:05.301
Yeah. Yeah.

01:20:05.385 --> 01:20:09.180
I believe I have
just what you're looking for.

01:20:09.263 --> 01:20:13.601
It's a beautiful property
on a very quiet street.

01:20:13.685 --> 01:20:17.855
I do love quiet.
I just can't take a noisy tomb anymore.

01:20:20.024 --> 01:20:21.901
The market in that area is booming,

01:20:21.985 --> 01:20:25.196
but if we move quick,
we can snatch up that last unit.

01:20:25.822 --> 01:20:28.199
If it's booming,
why is there still a house available?

01:20:28.282 --> 01:20:33.579
Well, there is a situation on the street
that needs to be relocated.

01:20:33.663 --> 01:20:36.207
But once it goes, so will the last house.

01:20:36.290 --> 01:20:40.003
We'll be arriving tomorrow
on air transylvania, flight 666.

01:20:40.086 --> 01:20:42.547
Oh, Mrs. Munster, I must warn you,

01:20:42.630 --> 01:20:45.008
I'm going to be heading straight
to a Halloween party

01:20:45.091 --> 01:20:46.384
after we visit the property.

01:20:46.467 --> 01:20:49.637
So don't be shocked by my appearance.

01:20:49.721 --> 01:20:52.223
Um... okay.

01:20:52.306 --> 01:20:55.727
- Well, we'll see you tomorrow. Goodbye.
- Okay. Bye-bye.

01:20:55.810 --> 01:20:57.311
Hmm.

01:20:57.395 --> 01:20:58.396
That was strange.

01:20:58.479 --> 01:20:59.605
What was strange?

01:20:59.689 --> 01:21:03.693
For some reason, the poor woman was
afraid we'd be shocked by her appearance.

01:21:03.776 --> 01:21:07.321
Women. They're always
so concerned about their looks.

01:21:07.822 --> 01:21:10.074
Not everyone
can be as beautiful as you, my dear.

01:21:10.158 --> 01:21:11.743
No, I guess not. [Chuckles]

01:21:13.745 --> 01:21:17.790
[Flight announcer] Good afternoon
and welcome to air transylvania,

01:21:17.874 --> 01:21:19.417
f/I'g/ir 666.

01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:26.007
We have a flying time of 22 hours
and 47 minutes to Los Angeles today.

01:21:26.716 --> 01:21:30.219
Oh, it sure was nice of that flight
attendant to bump us up to first class.

01:21:30.303 --> 01:21:32.305
First class, baby. [Laughs]

01:21:32.388 --> 01:21:35.308
Although it was a bit strange
when all the other first-class passengers

01:21:35.391 --> 01:21:37.101
moved to the back of the plane.

01:21:37.185 --> 01:21:40.438
Lily, my darling,
how many times must I remind you.

01:21:40.521 --> 01:21:42.607
The average person isn't accustomed

01:21:42.690 --> 01:21:46.402
to being around people
of such fine breeding

01:21:46.486 --> 01:21:48.154
up close and... [burps]

01:21:48.237 --> 01:21:49.655
Personal.

01:21:49.739 --> 01:21:51.574
Oh, I suppose you're right.

01:21:51.657 --> 01:21:54.619
But still, the way she was pushing
and shoving everyone.

01:21:54.702 --> 01:21:56.162
It was a bit aggressive.

01:21:56.245 --> 01:21:57.663
Where is she? You know what,

01:21:57.747 --> 01:21:59.665
I could go for another one.

01:21:59.749 --> 01:22:01.250
Hey. Yoo-hoo.

01:22:01.334 --> 01:22:03.795
I could go for another one
of these drinky-poos.

01:22:06.214 --> 01:22:09.258
Over here. Hi. [Chuckles]

01:22:09.342 --> 01:22:10.718
C-Can I... can I help you?

01:22:10.802 --> 01:22:14.013
I would like another one
of these delightful drinks.

01:22:14.639 --> 01:22:17.225
- What do you call this?
- Shirley temple.

01:22:17.308 --> 01:22:20.186
It's very strong. [Laughs]

01:22:20.269 --> 01:22:21.270
Okay.

01:22:41.624 --> 01:22:42.625
Here you go.

01:22:42.708 --> 01:22:43.835
Thank you, dear.

01:22:45.253 --> 01:22:49.006
You know, statistically,
flying is the safest way to travel.

01:22:58.683 --> 01:23:00.977
- [Air lock opens]
- [Wind howling]

01:23:01.060 --> 01:23:03.312
[Flight attendant screams]

01:23:07.275 --> 01:23:10.444
[Flight announcer on pa]
Welcome to beautiful Los Angeles.

01:23:10.528 --> 01:23:15.950
The local time here is 72:47,
and it's a balmy 79 degrees.

01:23:16.033 --> 01:23:18.828
Thanks for flying air transylvania.

01:23:18.911 --> 01:23:21.247
Oh, here comes our luggage. [Chuckles]

01:23:21.330 --> 01:23:23.583
Talk about service. [Chuckles]

01:23:23.666 --> 01:23:25.042
[Warning system beeping]

01:23:28.212 --> 01:23:31.757
Um, where's Herman? Herman!

01:23:35.845 --> 01:23:37.054
Here he comes.

01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:50.484
I'll never drink another Shirley temple

01:23:51.485 --> 01:23:53.112
for as long as I live.

01:23:54.947 --> 01:23:58.701
How do I know where they are?
Maybe they got wise to the situation.

01:23:58.784 --> 01:24:00.095
[High-pitched voice babbling on phone]

01:24:00.119 --> 01:24:02.496
That's true. They are from transylvania.
[Chuckles]

01:24:02.580 --> 01:24:04.832
- [Knocks on door]
- Oh, wait! Wait a minute.

01:24:04.916 --> 01:24:07.043
I think this is them. Okay, I gotta go.

01:24:07.126 --> 01:24:09.670
Time for me to work my magic.

01:24:16.219 --> 01:24:18.095
Greetings from transylvania.

01:24:29.690 --> 01:24:31.335
[Herman]
That's a strange way of saying hello.

01:24:31.359 --> 01:24:33.861
Oh, I guess we're gonna
have to get used to it.

01:24:33.945 --> 01:24:35.696
It ain't easy being beautiful. [Chuckles]

01:24:35.780 --> 01:24:37.615
Tell me about it. [Chuckles]

01:24:38.908 --> 01:24:42.828
- [Herman] Miss? Miss? Miss, wake up.
- [Groans]

01:24:45.831 --> 01:24:50.002
I assume you're the m-munsters?

01:24:50.086 --> 01:24:51.379
I'm Herman.

01:24:51.963 --> 01:24:54.090
And this is my darling better half, Lily.

01:24:54.173 --> 01:24:55.174
Hello.

01:24:55.967 --> 01:25:00.304
Oh, and that thing over there
is my father-in-law, the count.

01:25:00.388 --> 01:25:01.430
Pleased to meet you.

01:25:01.514 --> 01:25:02.932
[Groans]

01:25:03.015 --> 01:25:04.475
- Here you go.
- Here you go.

01:25:04.558 --> 01:25:05.559
[Grunts]

01:25:07.228 --> 01:25:09.272
So nice to meet you in person.

01:25:09.355 --> 01:25:11.941
Those costumes really threw me for a loop.

01:25:12.817 --> 01:25:15.695
And I thought I was taking it
to an extreme.

01:25:15.778 --> 01:25:18.489
Uh, well, way to get in the spirit
of the day!

01:25:19.407 --> 01:25:20.908
Thank you!

01:25:20.992 --> 01:25:22.618
Ooh, what spirit is that, exactly?

01:25:24.245 --> 01:25:26.163
[Laughing] Oh, you!

01:25:26.747 --> 01:25:29.333
Okay, my car is parked right out front.

01:25:29.417 --> 01:25:32.586
Uh, I'm just gonna grab my keys. Okay.

01:25:33.796 --> 01:25:37.383
I think when she said shocking
she meant gorgeous, huh?

01:25:37.466 --> 01:25:39.760
Ba-chicka-wow-wow. [Chuckles]

01:25:39.844 --> 01:25:42.179
Father,
please keep your fangs to yourself.

01:25:42.263 --> 01:25:43.514
Yeah, don't blow this.

01:25:43.597 --> 01:25:44.597
Follow me.

01:25:46.392 --> 01:25:47.560
[Horn honking]

01:25:47.643 --> 01:25:49.478
- Hi, hi, hi.
- Hi, hi.

01:25:50.938 --> 01:25:51.938
[Tires squeal]

01:25:54.442 --> 01:25:56.235
[Siren wailing]

01:25:56.319 --> 01:25:57.987
Lily, I want a picture of you.

01:26:00.614 --> 01:26:02.158
Idontfeelgood.

01:26:09.749 --> 01:26:12.626
[Children laughing]

01:26:26.057 --> 01:26:28.851
[Children laughing, chattering]

01:26:37.485 --> 01:26:38.736
[Cackling]

01:26:38.819 --> 01:26:42.281
Just in case you're wondering,
this is the party I'm all gussied up for.

01:26:42.365 --> 01:26:45.910
The residents throw
a big Halloween bash every year.

01:26:47.286 --> 01:26:49.622
Boy, we sure picked a happening area.

01:26:49.705 --> 01:26:54.168
I'm getting a little worried we might be
too boring for this hipster neighborhood.

01:26:54.251 --> 01:26:55.753
Speak for yourself.

01:26:55.836 --> 01:27:00.132
I'm always the first on the dance floor
at every funeral.

01:27:00.216 --> 01:27:02.051
- I bet you are.
- [Chuckles]

01:27:02.134 --> 01:27:03.052
[Tires screech]

01:27:03.135 --> 01:27:04.762
[Child] You look so good!

01:27:05.888 --> 01:27:07.348
Happy Halloween.

01:27:07.431 --> 01:27:10.601
Oh, my! What beautiful children.

01:27:10.684 --> 01:27:12.120
[Barbara] Are you planning on having kids?

01:27:12.144 --> 01:27:15.564
Well, I'm a little young for children.
I'm only 150.

01:27:16.315 --> 01:27:18.109
Although you know what they say.

01:27:18.192 --> 01:27:19.193
What... what's that?

01:27:19.276 --> 01:27:21.570
150 is the new 100.

01:27:22.446 --> 01:27:25.366
Oh. Oh! [Laughs]

01:27:27.743 --> 01:27:29.078
You are a trip.

01:27:29.829 --> 01:27:31.372
[Herman guffaws]

01:27:32.415 --> 01:27:33.457
A trip?

01:27:34.250 --> 01:27:35.876
- Hollywood lingo.
- Oh!

01:27:39.463 --> 01:27:42.091
Well, what do you think? Cute, right?

01:27:42.174 --> 01:27:43.551
Oh, my!

01:27:44.468 --> 01:27:45.594
Herman?

01:27:46.846 --> 01:27:49.140
I know. It's perfect.

01:27:49.223 --> 01:27:52.977
It's more than perfect, it's breathtaking.

01:27:54.103 --> 01:27:57.857
I've always wanted to be featured
in better tombs and gardens.

01:28:03.112 --> 01:28:07.116
Uh, okay, you crazy jokesters.
Uh, follow me.

01:28:08.826 --> 01:28:13.038
Herman, why is she walking towards
that hideous monstrosity?

01:28:13.706 --> 01:28:18.461
I think Barbara is trying to swindle us
into buying that abomination.

01:28:18.544 --> 01:28:21.797
She must think we're yokels
straight off the garlic wagon.

01:28:21.881 --> 01:28:26.302
[Groans] Herman, deal with this!
Show her who you're made of.

01:28:26.385 --> 01:28:28.095
Yeah, you're the man of the house.

01:28:29.388 --> 01:28:32.016
Look, Barbara.

01:28:36.270 --> 01:28:41.317
I must inform you
that we munsters were not born yesterday.

01:28:41.942 --> 01:28:45.946
I mean, some of my parts were,
of course... but that's besides the point.

01:28:46.947 --> 01:28:48.240
I want this house.

01:28:48.324 --> 01:28:49.658
[Thunder rumbling]

01:28:49.742 --> 01:28:52.036
- And I'm not gonna pay more than...
- Sold.

01:28:52.953 --> 01:28:55.414
Please, please. Don't argue with me.

01:28:55.498 --> 01:28:56.749
You'll only embarrass yourself.

01:28:56.832 --> 01:28:58.250
Let's be civilized.

01:28:58.334 --> 01:29:01.003
Whatever you say. The house is yours.

01:29:02.421 --> 01:29:05.633
Now, now, you don't want me to get tough.

01:29:06.926 --> 01:29:07.968
What?

01:29:08.594 --> 01:29:11.138
Wait. What'd you just say?

01:29:11.222 --> 01:29:13.057
The house is yours.

01:29:13.140 --> 01:29:16.435
This place has been a Thorn in my butt
for the past two years.

01:29:16.519 --> 01:29:19.897
If you wanna buy it
and restore it to its former glory,

01:29:19.980 --> 01:29:22.316
then you just go for it, honey!

01:29:22.399 --> 01:29:25.986
And another thing,
we don't want one grave moved.

01:29:26.070 --> 01:29:27.988
We're very sociable people.

01:29:29.073 --> 01:29:31.450
Um, okay. No problem.

01:29:31.534 --> 01:29:36.413
If you think it looks wonderful now,
just wait until we get finished with it.

01:29:36.497 --> 01:29:38.916
I can't wait to start poking around
the backyard.

01:29:38.999 --> 01:29:41.669
- Who knows who I might find?
- [Chuckling]

01:29:42.294 --> 01:29:44.755
So, when do you wanna move in?

[All] Right now!

01:30:06.610 --> 01:30:09.029
Well, now what?

01:30:09.530 --> 01:30:13.867
We've got the house of our dreams,
but we are flat broke.

01:30:15.786 --> 01:30:17.788
I guess we all have to get jobs.

01:30:18.789 --> 01:30:20.124
No, no, no, no.

01:30:21.292 --> 01:30:23.586
I mean, I'm the man of the house.

01:30:25.296 --> 01:30:28.382
Tomorrow I'll go out and get a job.

01:30:29.550 --> 01:30:30.926
Doing what, exactly?

01:30:33.012 --> 01:30:36.682
I don't know. I mean,
I'm pretty sure any business

01:30:36.765 --> 01:30:39.268
would wanna have me around the office
as eye candy.

01:31:16.055 --> 01:31:18.307
to go out and introduce ourselves
to the neighbors.

01:31:18.390 --> 01:31:21.935
That's a grand idea. We don't want them
thinking that the munsters are snobs.

01:31:22.019 --> 01:31:23.270
Speak for yourself.

Much like the icy touch
of the grim reaper.

01:32:48.981 --> 01:32:50.023
[Chuckles]

01:32:50.607 --> 01:32:52.025
That was a joke.

01:32:52.109 --> 01:32:54.278
[Herman laughs]

01:32:54.361 --> 01:32:56.405
The winner is...

01:32:56.488 --> 01:32:58.532
Mmmmm

01:32:58.615 --> 01:33:00.951
the munster family!

01:33:01.034 --> 01:33:03.579
- [Grandpa] Oh!
- [Applause]

01:33:12.838 --> 01:33:15.674
Herman, why is everyone staring at us?

01:33:15.758 --> 01:33:16.884
I think we just won.

01:33:17.676 --> 01:33:18.886
What did we win?

01:33:18.969 --> 01:33:21.346
Well, it's obviously
a beauty contest. [Chuckles]

01:33:21.430 --> 01:33:24.767
I say we grab the dough and get out
of here before they change their mind.

01:33:25.726 --> 01:33:29.021
Gaze upon these glorious rags of horror.

01:33:29.104 --> 01:33:31.398
- [Applause]
- [Audience exclaiming]

01:33:35.569 --> 01:33:39.072
Well, uh, this is quite the welcome.

01:33:39.156 --> 01:33:43.368
Uh, you see, um... uh, my family and I
just moved to this neighborhood

01:33:43.452 --> 01:33:44.912
only one hour ago.

01:33:45.621 --> 01:33:50.918
We are now the proud owner
of that beautiful little number, 1313.

01:33:51.001 --> 01:33:52.878
[Audience laughing]

01:33:55.255 --> 01:33:58.217
This is my beautiful wife, Lily.
She's dressed to kill.

01:33:58.759 --> 01:34:02.221
Unfortunately,
she cooks the same way. [Laughs]

01:34:05.724 --> 01:34:07.768
Okay, I think that's quite enough.

01:34:08.977 --> 01:34:12.105
Okay, okay. Hey, everybody,
thanks so much for the moola.

01:34:12.189 --> 01:34:15.818
And if anyone's hiring,
my dopey son-in-law's looking for a job.

01:34:15.901 --> 01:34:17.736
Okay, thank you! Come on.

01:34:17.820 --> 01:34:19.530
- We're number one!
- Okay.

01:34:19.613 --> 01:34:20.656
We're number one!

01:34:20.739 --> 01:34:22.449
[Cheering]

01:34:24.409 --> 01:34:27.037
Oh, my goodness.
Well, I'll have to visit you. Thank you.

01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:29.957
A ghost walks into the bar
and orders a shot of vodka.

01:34:30.040 --> 01:34:33.919
Listen, there's no blood in this.
I don't know, someone's playing a joke.

01:34:34.002 --> 01:34:36.213
Well, yes. You know...

01:34:36.296 --> 01:34:39.550
And the bartender says,
"sorry, we don't serve spirits here."

01:34:39.633 --> 01:34:40.884
[Laughs]

01:34:44.096 --> 01:34:46.765
Excuse me! Uh, lin! Oh, hi!

01:34:46.849 --> 01:34:49.309
Uh, why don't we, uh, go over here?

01:34:49.393 --> 01:34:50.936
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:34:51.019 --> 01:34:54.147
I got a million, believe me.
Fellas, you're gonna love it.

01:34:55.232 --> 01:34:58.694
Is it true you are looking
for gainful employment?

01:34:58.777 --> 01:35:03.240
Uh, because if it is, we might have
something of interest to you.

01:35:03.323 --> 01:35:06.785
Well, I hope it's
in the entertainment business.

01:35:06.869 --> 01:35:08.996
No, we're in the business of death.

01:35:09.580 --> 01:35:13.083
The finest funeral parlor
in all of mockingbird heights.

01:35:13.166 --> 01:35:15.002
I am Mr. Gateman.

01:35:15.085 --> 01:35:16.461
I am Mr. Goodbury.

01:35:16.545 --> 01:35:19.089
And I am Mr. Graves.

01:35:19.172 --> 01:35:20.382
Funeral parlor.

01:35:21.675 --> 01:35:22.885
I think I can dig that.

01:35:22.968 --> 01:35:28.807
We need a man to move some
of our larger clients from box to box.

01:35:29.558 --> 01:35:30.976
I've got experience in that.

01:35:31.059 --> 01:35:36.315
We don't like to leave the stiffs
lying around for more than 48 hours or so.

01:35:36.398 --> 01:35:38.734
They, uh, tend to ferment.

01:35:38.817 --> 01:35:41.445
Have you fellas heard
about the new glass coffins?

01:35:41.528 --> 01:35:44.615
We have not. Are they successful?

01:35:44.698 --> 01:35:47.784
Remains to be seen, Mr. Gateman.

01:35:47.868 --> 01:35:49.953
Remains to be seen.

01:35:50.037 --> 01:35:52.205
[Laughing]

01:35:57.377 --> 01:36:00.172
[Laughing] After you, my dear.

01:36:05.761 --> 01:36:07.971
Boy, what a fun group!

01:36:08.722 --> 01:36:12.935
I have to admit, I haven't had
that much fun since storming the bastille.

01:36:13.644 --> 01:36:17.272
Well, I don't know about you two,
but I'm exhausted.

01:36:17.356 --> 01:36:19.441
Those neighbors
sure can talk your ears off.

01:36:20.817 --> 01:36:22.152
Oh, what's wrong?

01:36:22.235 --> 01:36:24.655
I'm just checking to see
if my ears are still there.

01:36:24.738 --> 01:36:27.449
I'd hate to lose one.
Makes my reading glasses hang funny.

01:36:27.532 --> 01:36:29.242
[Laughs]

01:36:29.326 --> 01:36:32.621
Okay, I'm gonna hit the slab.

01:36:32.704 --> 01:36:34.623
- Good nightmare!

01:36:34.706 --> 01:36:40.504

01:36:40.587 --> 01:36:42.464
[shouts] Darn, darn, darn!

01:36:43.298 --> 01:36:46.259
Oh, hermie, you're so talented.

01:36:49.930 --> 01:36:52.849
[Actor 1 on TV] I loved you once,
but now you belong with the dead

01:36:53.433 --> 01:36:55.560
I want to live.
Even in this strange, new world.

01:36:55.644 --> 01:36:58.522
Oh, yeah!

01:36:59.106 --> 01:37:00.983
Herman, what're you doing?

01:37:01.066 --> 01:37:02.818
Just practicing a few moves.

01:37:03.986 --> 01:37:06.405
Thursday night
is league night at the parlor.

01:37:06.488 --> 01:37:08.365
I thought you hated bowling.

01:37:08.448 --> 01:37:11.159
Besides, you haven't even started
your new job yet.

01:37:11.243 --> 01:37:13.745
Trying to get ready.
Can't let the fellas down.

01:37:13.829 --> 01:37:16.665
I know, but let's not get carried away.

01:37:21.336 --> 01:37:22.504
[Actor 2 on TV] It's deadl

01:37:22.587 --> 01:37:24.881
[actor 3]
For thy sake, / was buried alive.

01:37:24.965 --> 01:37:25.966
Come to bed, dear.

01:37:26.049 --> 01:37:28.218
You don't wanna be tired
for your first day of work.

01:37:28.301 --> 01:37:30.095
I really like that Mr. Gateman.

01:37:30.762 --> 01:37:32.347
He paid me the nicest compliment.

01:37:32.431 --> 01:37:33.849
Oh, what was it?

01:37:33.932 --> 01:37:38.020
He said,
"munster, you have a face for funerals."

01:37:38.103 --> 01:37:40.564
How sweet. And how true.

01:37:40.647 --> 01:37:44.568
[Actor 1 on TV]
Let me go! Let me go! Don't k/ll me!

01:37:45.485 --> 01:37:46.862
Still got it.

01:37:57.039 --> 01:37:58.999
[Chuckles]

01:38:00.751 --> 01:38:02.335
So what do you have planned for today?

01:38:02.419 --> 01:38:05.672
Oh, I was gonna hang around the house
for a little while,

01:38:05.756 --> 01:38:09.634
see if I can figure out a way
to turn Igor back into his old self.

01:38:09.718 --> 01:38:13.055
Oh, I kind of like the new Igor.
He's got a lot more pep.

01:38:13.138 --> 01:38:14.181
Yeah.

01:38:15.474 --> 01:38:16.933
[Sq uawks]

01:38:17.017 --> 01:38:21.313
The time is get-to-work,
you big dummy. Nevermore.

01:38:21.396 --> 01:38:24.191
Oh, golly. I'm gonna be late.

01:38:27.736 --> 01:38:29.237
Don't forget your lunch.

01:38:29.321 --> 01:38:31.990
I made you a special surprise
for your first day.

01:38:32.074 --> 01:38:34.659
Chocolate chip cookies
shaped like Mickey mouse?

01:38:35.452 --> 01:38:37.079
You'll find out at lunch.

01:38:39.247 --> 01:38:40.247
Gotta boogie.

01:38:41.208 --> 01:38:42.209
Knock 'em dead.

01:38:43.293 --> 01:38:44.669
I'm pretty sure they already are.

01:38:44.753 --> 01:38:46.963
But it's always good to double-check.

01:38:47.047 --> 01:38:48.173
[Laughs]

01:38:49.674 --> 01:38:50.675
Have fun.

- [Slurps, burps]

01:39:08.318 --> 01:39:11.279
Bummer. What a crummy day.

01:39:26.378 --> 01:39:28.088
[Children laughing]

911 emergency.

01:40:01.329 --> 01:40:03.915
Car 54, where are you?

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:06.877
Herman, what is the matter?

01:40:06.960 --> 01:40:08.587
It's a freak show out there.

01:40:09.171 --> 01:40:12.924
Everywhere you look,
it's more horrible than the next.

01:40:13.592 --> 01:40:17.262
I think we've been invaded
by outer space mutants.

01:40:18.263 --> 01:40:19.931
What are you talking about?

01:40:20.015 --> 01:40:22.058
All the beautiful people from last night

01:40:22.142 --> 01:40:26.062
have been replaced
by these hideous creatures.

01:40:26.146 --> 01:40:29.065
Oh, Herman. Don't be so dramatic.

01:40:29.149 --> 01:40:32.277
Everybody looks different
in the daylight. Let me take a look.

01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:34.362
No, don't. Don't, don't!

01:40:41.453 --> 01:40:42.621
Icantlook.

01:40:47.250 --> 01:40:48.335
The horror.

01:40:53.965 --> 01:40:57.052
[People chattering, laughing]

01:40:57.135 --> 01:41:00.388
- I, for one, just don't understand it.
- Neither do I.

01:41:00.472 --> 01:41:03.058
What happened to all the hotties
from last night?

01:41:03.141 --> 01:41:04.476
What are we gonna do?

01:41:04.559 --> 01:41:06.937
We can't live like this,
with people that look like that.

01:41:07.020 --> 01:41:08.897
I agree with my favorite son-in-law.

01:41:08.980 --> 01:41:10.690
- It's a disgrace!
- Yeah.

01:41:10.774 --> 01:41:13.568
Herman munster.
I can't believe what I'm hearing.

01:41:13.652 --> 01:41:15.695
I expect this from my father, but you?

01:41:16.446 --> 01:41:18.406
Everyone can't be as fortunate as us.

01:41:18.490 --> 01:41:21.034
It's what's inside a person that counts.

01:41:26.498 --> 01:41:28.541
Well then,
I'm gonna need a pair of X-ray glasses

01:41:28.625 --> 01:41:30.293
because I can't handle the outside.

01:41:30.377 --> 01:41:34.172
He's right. I haven't seen anything
that gruesome in all of my lives.

01:41:34.256 --> 01:41:37.425
- [Banging on door]
- Oh, no! It's one of those freaks.

01:41:38.385 --> 01:41:39.552
Don't answer it.

01:41:40.220 --> 01:41:42.222
We are going to answer that door
as a family

01:41:42.305 --> 01:41:45.058
and greet whoever is there as our equal.

01:41:45.141 --> 01:41:46.184
[Breathes heavily]

01:41:46.268 --> 01:41:50.689
Okay, but I hope this lessens the shock.

01:41:54.109 --> 01:41:55.110
Follow me.

01:41:58.905 --> 01:42:00.490

You got a lot of nerve coming here,

01:42:18.842 --> 01:42:22.721
After what you pulled,
I oughta belt you right in the kisser.

01:42:22.804 --> 01:42:26.725
Herman, baby. Before you go
all ape on me, I got a surprise.

01:42:26.808 --> 01:42:29.728
I made a killing in Vegas
after that castle deal.

01:42:29.811 --> 01:42:31.146
And here's your share!
