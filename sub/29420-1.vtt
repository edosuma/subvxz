01:25.252 --> 01:27.412
<i>Security clearance, level four.</i>

01:28.213 --> 01:30.053
<i>Stand clear of the doors.</i>

01:31.717 --> 01:33.629
<i>Security doors activated.</i>

01:36.597 --> 01:38.634
<i>Factor four increasing.</i>

01:39.516 --> 01:41.007
<i>Auto vacuum disengaged.</i>

01:41.101 --> 01:42.182
Dr. Betruger.

01:43.645 --> 01:46.809
Ah. Thank you.
All right.

01:51.361 --> 01:53.728
<i>Auto set camera engaged.</i>

02:19.723 --> 02:21.951
<i>Have they explained
how it's going to work?</i>

02:21.975 --> 02:24.342
<i>Are you nervous?</i>

02:24.436 --> 02:26.177
<i>Don't worry, it's perfectly
natural to be.</i>

02:26.480 --> 02:28.893
No, I'm honored
to have been chosen, sir.

02:29.274 --> 02:31.266
Wonderful.
Well, I'm very much

02:31.360 --> 02:33.977
looking forward to meeting you
face to face, young man.

02:57.302 --> 02:59.422
<i>Freehold parameters increased.</i>

03:00.263 --> 03:01.703
<i>Slot interrupt.</i>

03:06.061 --> 03:07.205
<i>Engaged.</i>

03:07.229 --> 03:08.811
Phobos is set.

03:09.356 --> 03:11.393
<i>Nevada is set.</i>

03:22.327 --> 03:23.863
Activate the gates.

03:28.750 --> 03:30.457
<i>Gates activated.</i>

03:44.808 --> 03:46.595
Now, Dr. Barnes.

04:08.707 --> 04:12.075
<i>Nevada, Dr. Barnes
has made it to Phobos.</i>

04:15.213 --> 04:17.125
- Doctor, we did it.
- Yes.

04:17.214 --> 04:18.375
We did it.

04:19.843 --> 04:23.427
<i>Red seal warning.
Red seal warning.</i>

04:24.055 --> 04:25.887
<i>Energy source unknown.</i>

04:26.475 --> 04:28.592
<i>Unknown thermal heat pad.</i>

04:49.456 --> 04:50.947
I want you to have this.

04:51.041 --> 04:53.283
Something to remember me by.

04:53.919 --> 04:57.458
Have faith that in your darkest moment
you won't be alone.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.540
I'll be there,
watching over you,

05:01.218 --> 05:02.959
my beautiful girl.

05:04.095 --> 05:06.087
<i>Believe in yourself, Joan.</i>

05:27.077 --> 05:28.846
<i>Welcome back, Lieutenant Dark.</i>

05:28.870 --> 05:33.240
<i>My name is Daisy, and I'm here
to assist you in any way possible.</i>

05:33.333 --> 05:36.417
<i>While you reacclimate,
you may want to have a seat.</i>

05:36.628 --> 05:39.416
<i>It may take a moment for your eyes
to adjust to the light.</i>

05:39.506 --> 05:42.214
<i>While you have been given fluids,
I strongly recommend</i>

05:42.300 --> 05:46.169
<i>drinking 200 ounces of water
in the next six to eight hours.</i>

05:46.388 --> 05:47.924
Are we almost there yet?

05:48.139 --> 05:51.974
<i>Yes, we'll arrive at Phobos
in approximately three hours.</i>

06:11.246 --> 06:14.455
Good morning, happy campers.

06:14.541 --> 06:16.703
No, I am not another
AI greeting you.

06:16.793 --> 06:19.001
No, I wouldn't dream
of taking Daisy's job from her.

06:19.087 --> 06:23.206
Nope, I am your pilot,
welcoming you back to consciousness.

06:24.217 --> 06:26.630
Oh, and before you ask,
I totally went through all your stuff

06:26.720 --> 06:28.712
during the four-month slumber.

06:31.349 --> 06:33.056
<i>Well, some of you
might feel queasy</i>

06:33.143 --> 06:35.931
<i>after your crypto-sleep, so...</i>

06:36.021 --> 06:38.513
Hey, don't worry.
That's perfectly natural.

06:39.983 --> 06:41.394
<i>Shower engaged.</i>

06:45.238 --> 06:46.979
<i>Oh! Before I forget,</i>

06:47.073 --> 06:48.860
<i>we've been having
some plumbing issues</i>

06:48.950 --> 06:50.737
<i>over the past few weeks.</i>

06:50.827 --> 06:52.819
It's been acting real spotty,

06:52.913 --> 06:55.781
<i>so, uh, I'd suggest you wait
until we get to your final destination</i>

06:55.874 --> 06:57.206
<i>before actually
having a shower.</i>

06:57.292 --> 06:59.534
<i>Malfunction.
Malfunction. Malfunction.</i>

06:59.628 --> 07:01.164
You've gotta be
kidding me.

07:06.885 --> 07:09.343
Fuckers, die.
Where the fuck did you go?

07:09.846 --> 07:12.338
Tarek, I'm telling you,
that's why he said it.

07:12.432 --> 07:13.432
To throw us off.

07:14.017 --> 07:15.178
It was a joke, Li.

07:15.268 --> 07:16.884
That's what
he wants us to think!

07:16.978 --> 07:19.641
Hey, you honestly believe
he went through our stuff?

07:20.148 --> 07:24.108
Guy's a perv. Like you, Harry.
So, yes, I do.

07:27.864 --> 07:29.696
Oh, shit!

07:29.783 --> 07:32.992
Carley, that deep sleep
learning program,

07:33.078 --> 07:34.535
does that shit
really work?

07:38.625 --> 07:41.789
You know, I had to actually
learn my foreign languages.

07:41.878 --> 07:44.440
Yeah, eight dead
languages no one's ever heard of.

07:46.508 --> 07:48.545
There's no chance
you just forgot them?

07:48.635 --> 07:51.093
No. I never go anywhere
without them.

07:51.179 --> 07:52.715
They're my lucky pair.

07:53.974 --> 07:55.465
You got a lucky pair
of undies?

07:56.977 --> 07:58.263
What makes them lucky?

08:00.105 --> 08:03.564
Oh, Winslow, wouldn't you love
to find out?

08:04.401 --> 08:06.563
He better not have touched
any of my shit.

08:06.653 --> 08:09.441
Akua, you think the same guy
that stole Li's underwear

08:09.531 --> 08:11.067
would take
something of yours?

08:11.157 --> 08:13.649
And I'm saying,
he better not have.

08:14.077 --> 08:16.410
By the way, guys,
who's gonna tell Carley

08:16.496 --> 08:18.909
that the cryo-sleep
turned her hair blue?

08:19.457 --> 08:21.073
Oh, shit.

08:21.167 --> 08:22.783
What you gonna do?

08:22.877 --> 08:23.877
Morning.

08:30.427 --> 08:32.134
Is this shit edible?

08:37.308 --> 08:39.107
You know, I think it's time
for that briefing.

08:39.184 --> 08:40.596
- Yep.
- Yeah, I think so. Yeah.

08:43.063 --> 08:45.772
Hey, Li,
where do you keep those undies?

08:46.192 --> 08:48.149
Come on,
move your ass.

08:54.617 --> 08:55.983
Seems like a good group.

08:56.536 --> 08:57.652
They can be.

08:58.455 --> 09:01.118
- You look good, Joan.
- Thanks.

09:02.125 --> 09:04.333
You're a lieutenant now.
That's, that's impressive.

09:05.045 --> 09:06.045
Thanks.

09:06.963 --> 09:08.499
And you went into science.

09:08.673 --> 09:11.416
I've always
been in science.

09:12.135 --> 09:13.135
Right.

09:14.304 --> 09:15.636
Sorry, I forgot.

09:16.806 --> 09:18.092
What, we dated for what?

09:18.183 --> 09:20.049
Six weeks, ten years ago?

09:20.143 --> 09:22.055
It was more like
four months.

09:24.230 --> 09:25.230
Oh.

09:27.067 --> 09:28.808
Have you been
to Phobos before?

09:29.069 --> 09:31.482
No, no, my first time
off Earth, actually.

09:31.571 --> 09:33.312
This is sort of
a promotion for me.

09:33.406 --> 09:34.406
How about you?

09:34.908 --> 09:36.399
Something like that.

09:36.993 --> 09:38.313
Well, in the
scientific community,

09:38.369 --> 09:39.780
being assigned to Phobos

09:40.747 --> 09:42.363
is like winning
the lottery.

09:42.457 --> 09:44.119
It's the very best draw
you can get.

09:44.709 --> 09:48.703
Funny, Phobos is considered
the very worst draw a UAC Marine can get.

10:00.517 --> 10:02.244
<i>During Dr. Barnes'
follow up exam,</i>

10:02.268 --> 10:03.746
<i>we discovered antidepressants
in his system.</i>

10:03.770 --> 10:06.012
<i>No doubt this contributed
to his current condition.</i>

10:06.106 --> 10:08.268
Regarding the procedure,

10:08.358 --> 10:10.020
there were some
unexpected power surges,

10:10.110 --> 10:11.646
a few blackouts
on the upper levels,

10:11.736 --> 10:13.068
some damage.

10:13.404 --> 10:15.862
We'll install additional
backup power supplies

10:15.949 --> 10:17.861
<i>to reinforce the gate
for the next test.</i>

10:17.951 --> 10:19.533
<i>I recommend you do the same.</i>

10:20.453 --> 10:21.910
Of course, Doctor,

10:21.996 --> 10:23.703
but UAC Board
won't approve proceeding

10:23.790 --> 10:26.328
until this incident has been
investigated thoroughly.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.542
<i>You let me worry
about the board.</i>

10:28.628 --> 10:29.628
<i>Excuse me?</i>

10:29.712 --> 10:31.294
I have great latitude

10:31.381 --> 10:33.301
with the information
I choose to share with them.

10:33.341 --> 10:34.752
I believe that this incident

10:34.843 --> 10:36.459
unfairly judges the result.

10:36.553 --> 10:41.844
Despite it all, we teleported
a human from Earth to Phobos.

10:42.058 --> 10:44.425
Who is displaying signs
of extreme mental disorder

10:44.519 --> 10:45.555
less than a sol later.

10:45.645 --> 10:47.102
That was
because of the drugs.

10:47.355 --> 10:48.971
And the physical changes?

10:49.065 --> 10:50.209
<i>We always knew
there were going to be</i>

10:50.233 --> 10:52.145
<i>some cell
reconfiguration issues.</i>

10:52.235 --> 10:55.728
We deconstructed a human
and reassembled them.

10:55.822 --> 10:57.688
I'm not gonna stop

10:57.782 --> 11:00.399
just because the subject's
fingernails grew.

11:00.702 --> 11:02.159
<i>We'll make corrections.</i>

11:02.453 --> 11:03.453
Dr. Betruger,

11:04.414 --> 11:07.907
what if the trip wasn't as instantaneous
as it first appeared?

11:08.293 --> 11:10.455
<i>We are violating
the laws of physics.</i>

11:10.545 --> 11:12.286
I'm fully aware
of what we're doing.

11:13.381 --> 11:15.668
Ahmed, we're running
out of time.

11:15.758 --> 11:18.045
If we don't show progress,
they'll shut us down.

11:18.136 --> 11:19.547
There's too much at stake.

11:19.679 --> 11:22.547
<i>I'm not going to allow bureaucrats
that don't understand</i>

11:22.640 --> 11:24.802
the science that
keeps them alive today

11:24.893 --> 11:26.100
determine the science

11:26.186 --> 11:28.394
that will keep them
alive tomorrow.

11:29.063 --> 11:31.100
I could not,
in good conscience,

11:31.191 --> 11:33.478
select another to go
through the gates.

11:33.568 --> 11:36.402
<i>You won't have to.
I'll go myself.</i>

11:43.119 --> 11:45.736
Phobos runs
on Martian time.

11:46.623 --> 11:48.990
A Martian day is called a sol.

11:49.834 --> 11:52.702
A sol is 24 hours
and 39 minutes long.

11:53.338 --> 11:57.548
Phobos is the innermost
and larger of the two Martian moons,

11:57.634 --> 11:59.546
and the research facility
is located

11:59.636 --> 12:01.798
a click north
of the Stickney crater.

12:01.888 --> 12:04.676
Yes, sir. Is all this
information gonna be on the test?

12:04.766 --> 12:05.927
Shut up, Rance.

12:06.601 --> 12:08.342
Oh, it's fine, Doc.
Join us.

12:09.646 --> 12:11.603
You all know
Dr. Bennett Stone?

12:11.814 --> 12:13.396
If not, now you do.

12:13.483 --> 12:15.065
He's hitching a ride with us.

12:15.151 --> 12:17.359
Now, the facility is built
into the moon,

12:17.445 --> 12:19.152
and is divided
into three levels.

12:19.697 --> 12:21.905
Main level includes
the cargo bay,

12:21.991 --> 12:23.698
various offices,
living quarters,

12:23.785 --> 12:25.993
administrative offices
and amenities.

12:26.621 --> 12:29.785
Level two, service
and maintenance.

12:29.958 --> 12:31.995
It's also where they store
the computer servers.

12:32.460 --> 12:35.203
And finally, level three

12:35.296 --> 12:37.379
contains the laboratories
and reactor.

12:37.465 --> 12:38.956
What kind of a reactor?

12:39.259 --> 12:40.340
Fusion reactor.

12:41.803 --> 12:42.919
Nuclear?

12:43.388 --> 12:44.720
Yeah, but it's safe.

12:44.806 --> 12:45.908
Because nothing bad
ever happened

12:45.932 --> 12:46.932
with nuclear power.

12:47.016 --> 12:49.850
Well, the moon poses
more risk than the reactor.

12:49.936 --> 12:51.598
What do you mean?

12:51.813 --> 12:54.897
Well, Phobos is one of the most
unstable environments in the solar system.

12:54.983 --> 12:56.460
That's why they call it
"the Doomed Moon."

12:56.484 --> 12:57.691
Cool.

12:58.069 --> 13:00.356
Thank you, Dr. Stone,

13:00.905 --> 13:03.488
for properly scaring the shit out of us all.

13:03.908 --> 13:05.865
Okay, moving on
to base personnel.

13:05.952 --> 13:07.318
There are currently
90 in total.

13:07.412 --> 13:09.278
Mostly scientists,
but also

13:09.372 --> 13:12.740
there's maintenance,
custodial and kitchen staff.

13:12.834 --> 13:15.827
There's even a chaplain,
if you're feeling the need to repent.

13:18.214 --> 13:20.046
Our primary responsibility...

13:20.133 --> 13:22.045
I knew he'd
get there eventually.

13:22.302 --> 13:24.635
...is providing
base security.

13:25.179 --> 13:26.920
Babysitting.

13:27.015 --> 13:28.847
So, what's the danger?

13:29.517 --> 13:30.517
Pardon me, Tarek?

13:30.601 --> 13:33.560
Well, we're security.
So what's to secure?

13:33.646 --> 13:35.979
Well, UAC's intellectual
property being developed here

13:36.065 --> 13:37.897
is worth billions
on the black market.

13:37.984 --> 13:40.351
There've been numerous
reported instances of smuggling...

13:40.445 --> 13:41.925
Why did we all
get sent here?

13:42.196 --> 13:44.188
There's only one of us
that fucked up.

13:44.282 --> 13:45.523
But, what,
we all get fucked?

13:45.616 --> 13:47.094
I'm right here. If you're
gonna talk about me,

13:47.118 --> 13:49.235
have the balls
to address me directly.

13:49.329 --> 13:50.911
You fucked up, Lieutenant.

13:51.247 --> 13:52.933
And now we're all stuck here
on a three-year tour

13:52.957 --> 13:54.414
to the fucking Doomed Moon!

13:54.500 --> 13:55.616
All right, knock it off!

13:56.627 --> 13:58.664
Now, we succeed
and fail as a unit.

13:58.921 --> 14:01.066
And if you think I can't find
a worse place in the solar system

14:01.090 --> 14:04.003
to park your ass
for a few years, try me.

14:04.093 --> 14:05.629
Do I make myself clear?

14:05.720 --> 14:06.836
Yes, sir.

14:06.929 --> 14:09.387
Okay, you have
a little over an hour before we land.

14:09.474 --> 14:12.467
Take that time to pack your personals,
ready for departure.

14:13.603 --> 14:14.603
Dismissed.

14:20.109 --> 14:21.896
Come on, move your ass.

14:24.989 --> 14:26.091
We'll get
to the Martians

14:26.115 --> 14:28.778
and, uh, get a few beers
into us, I reckon.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.137
I guess four months
of hibernation

14:30.161 --> 14:31.368
didn't help ease tensions.

14:31.454 --> 14:33.366
Did you expect
it would?

14:33.456 --> 14:35.573
Captain, I begged
the review board to punish only me.

14:35.666 --> 14:37.658
I can't believe
they didn't take the advice

14:37.752 --> 14:40.210
from the person they were disciplining
for insubordination.

14:42.673 --> 14:43.673
Hey,

14:45.843 --> 14:47.800
in order to fight the enemy,

14:47.887 --> 14:49.799
you gotta stop
fighting yourself, Joan.

14:51.641 --> 14:52.641
Go on.

15:07.990 --> 15:09.481
Are you new?

15:09.575 --> 15:12.283
Yes, Doctor. I'm Veronica.

15:12.370 --> 15:13.972
Hey, I'm the one
that should be nervous, not you.

15:13.996 --> 15:15.157
You're doing fine.

15:15.832 --> 15:17.448
Veronica Cyr.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.283
Lovely last name.

15:19.377 --> 15:20.663
Right, you're all set.

15:20.753 --> 15:21.914
Thank you, Veronica.

15:24.465 --> 15:25.465
Thank you.

15:26.134 --> 15:28.842
Now, if you'll excuse me,

15:30.221 --> 15:31.507
I've a trip to make.

15:35.560 --> 15:36.641
Dr. Peterson.

15:36.727 --> 15:38.639
- Yes, Doctor.
- Dr. Kahn.

15:38.729 --> 15:40.015
<i>I'm ready to go.</i>

15:40.106 --> 15:41.187
Copy that, Doctor.

15:42.692 --> 15:44.228
Everyone take your
positions, please.

15:44.318 --> 15:45.878
- Right away, Doctor.
- Yes.

15:56.831 --> 15:59.118
<i>The thing about crypto-sleep is
you don't dream.</i>

15:59.667 --> 16:02.751
Like, you just closed your eyes
for a moment.

16:03.671 --> 16:06.505
<i>So it feels like I just left you,
and that feeling sucks.</i>

16:07.508 --> 16:08.861
I should never
have got on this ship.

16:08.885 --> 16:10.485
You were right,
I should've given notice.

16:12.388 --> 16:14.971
<i>So it's what I'm gonna do
after we land.</i>

16:15.057 --> 16:18.141
I'm gonna get the unit set up
and then I'm gonna resign.

16:21.147 --> 16:25.312
They'll be pissed,
but time for this old marine to retire.

16:26.611 --> 16:29.228
I love you and Bernadette.

16:32.992 --> 16:34.904
<i>I wanna be with you,
I wanna come home.</i>

16:35.244 --> 16:36.985
I'm going to come home.

16:43.503 --> 16:44.789
<i>Engaged.</i>

17:13.866 --> 17:16.028
<i>Warning. Power failure.</i>

17:16.452 --> 17:18.444
<i>Backup systems engaging.</i>

17:19.038 --> 17:20.038
Is everyone okay?

17:24.042 --> 17:25.409
Where's Dr. Betruger?

17:27.046 --> 17:28.332
Oh, my God.

17:29.757 --> 17:31.874
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait, okay?

17:34.554 --> 17:35.715
Oh, fuck.

18:14.760 --> 18:16.092
<i>Welcome to Phobos.</i>

18:17.513 --> 18:18.674
Let's go.

18:22.768 --> 18:23.996
First round of drinks
on me, guys.

18:24.020 --> 18:26.353
- Akua, you're buying?
- That'll be a first.

18:26.522 --> 18:27.602
It's good to see you, Joan.

18:28.524 --> 18:30.641
Yeah, you too, Bennett.
See you around.

18:31.527 --> 18:33.814
Yeah. See you around.

18:39.952 --> 18:43.116
Hello, Phobos Tower,
this is <i>Nola</i> requesting entry, over.

18:50.129 --> 18:51.370
Hello, Phobos Tower,
this is

18:51.547 --> 18:54.540
Nola <i>at the door
requesting entry, over.</i>

18:56.093 --> 18:57.550
Daisy, can you try?

18:58.095 --> 19:00.007
<i>Certainly.
One moment.</i>

19:00.181 --> 19:01.717
What's the problem?

19:01.891 --> 19:03.285
Well, we're knocking
on the front door,

19:03.309 --> 19:04.470
but nobody's home.

19:04.644 --> 19:06.476
So I'm sending Daisy
around back.

19:06.812 --> 19:08.303
And if they don't answer?

19:09.148 --> 19:10.588
Well, then it's your
fucking problem.

19:10.733 --> 19:14.727
<i>I'm afraid I am unable to establish
communication with Phobos Tower.</i>

19:14.987 --> 19:18.401
<i>Incoming priority message. Code one.</i>

19:18.574 --> 19:20.486
Nola, <i>this is
UAC Martian Command.</i>

19:20.576 --> 19:23.114
<i>Uh, we have an urgent
developing situation.</i>

19:23.204 --> 19:24.570
<i>Please hold your position.</i>

19:28.876 --> 19:31.914
We got a problem. Come with me.
You too, Dr. Stone.

19:32.004 --> 19:33.085
What's going on?

19:33.172 --> 19:36.085
Phobos is not responding.
Their system's offline,

19:36.175 --> 19:38.337
so there's no
AI or human to let us inside.

19:39.011 --> 19:41.173
They're trying
a remote override now.

19:41.430 --> 19:43.492
Well, if their system's offline,
they won't be able to,

19:43.516 --> 19:45.678
- but there's another way in.
- How?

19:45.768 --> 19:48.008
There's an emergency entrance
built into the landing pad.

19:48.771 --> 19:49.831
You got
a camera underneath?

19:49.855 --> 19:50.891
Yep.

19:52.608 --> 19:53.689
There you go.

20:02.076 --> 20:03.192
There.

20:03.994 --> 20:05.781
I thought you've
never been here before.

20:05.871 --> 20:08.955
I haven't. Just, when I found out
I was being transferred,

20:09.041 --> 20:10.894
I read everything
there is to know about the base.

20:10.918 --> 20:12.955
Including where
the emergency entrance is

20:13.045 --> 20:15.332
in case you ever got
locked out on the surface?

20:15.423 --> 20:17.540
I like to read.

20:17.633 --> 20:19.590
<i>Captain Savage,
this is Martian Command.</i>

20:19.844 --> 20:21.176
<i>That's a negative
on establishing</i>

20:21.262 --> 20:22.548
<i>a remote access.</i>

20:22.638 --> 20:25.176
Copy that.
Uh, we found another way in.

20:25.266 --> 20:26.552
How should we proceed?

20:26.892 --> 20:28.884
<i>Copy that. Stand by
for mission briefing.</i>

20:30.062 --> 20:31.849
"Mission briefing."
That was quick.

20:32.022 --> 20:34.309
- Is that good?
- No.

20:37.069 --> 20:38.422
<i>Approximately
20 minutes ago,</i>

20:38.446 --> 20:41.359
the Phobos Research Facility
went offline and dark.

20:41.449 --> 20:43.566
Our mission is to
enter the facility,

20:43.659 --> 20:45.867
ascertain the situation,
get the base back online.

20:46.036 --> 20:48.198
But why is it important
to get the base online?

20:48.372 --> 20:50.238
Some of the experiments
are extremely high risk

20:50.416 --> 20:52.624
and require
very precise monitoring.

20:52.710 --> 20:53.895
Even the smallest change
can render

20:53.919 --> 20:56.206
years of work
and progress meaningless.

20:56.297 --> 20:57.937
Command received
a distress signal

20:58.007 --> 20:59.794
moments before the base
went offline.

20:59.967 --> 21:02.004
- Daisy, play it.
<i>- Playing audio.</i>

21:15.149 --> 21:17.106
What the fuck is that?

21:17.276 --> 21:19.609
Enough to suggest
it's more than just a blown fuse.

21:20.196 --> 21:21.196
Any more questions?

21:21.280 --> 21:22.400
- No.
- No, sir.

21:22.448 --> 21:23.842
- We roll in 10 minutes.
- Okay.

21:23.866 --> 21:24.926
- Yes, Captain.
- All right.

21:24.950 --> 21:26.710
- Copy that.
- No beers then.

21:27.286 --> 21:28.597
If we're not able to get
the base back online...

21:28.621 --> 21:30.640
Hey, hey, don't worry.
We'll be ready to jump off this rock

21:30.664 --> 21:33.031
faster than Daisy can do
the square root of three million.

21:33.125 --> 21:35.333
<i>The square root
of three million is</i>

21:35.419 --> 21:40.585
<i>1,732.05080757.</i>

21:48.933 --> 21:50.035
You guys know
what this is, right?

21:50.059 --> 21:51.925
Ugh. Not this again.

21:52.770 --> 21:54.727
- It's aliens.
- Aliens.

21:55.189 --> 21:56.976
- Hey, Winslow?
- Yes, mate.

21:57.149 --> 21:58.890
In all recorded
human history,

21:58.984 --> 22:02.443
there's never, ever been any evidence of
extraterrestrial life.

22:02.696 --> 22:04.966
Hey, just 'cause there hasn't been,
doesn't mean there won't.

22:04.990 --> 22:08.028
And they are gonna rue the day
they fuck with me, Doc.

22:09.328 --> 22:10.739
I'm their ultra-nightmare.

22:16.627 --> 22:19.085
Can't believe you're bringing
that weak-ass shit.

22:19.171 --> 22:22.164
You got your toy,
I got mine.

22:27.304 --> 22:29.136
Daisy, deploy
the extension bridge.

22:29.223 --> 22:31.465
<i>Copy. Deploying
extension bridge.</i>

22:46.282 --> 22:47.523
Whoa. Hey.

22:59.211 --> 23:00.622
What the fuck, Daisy?

23:00.713 --> 23:02.124
<i>All sys...
Systems normal.</i>

23:07.094 --> 23:08.801
Stay alert
and keep close.

23:08.888 --> 23:11.221
Follow our instructions
and you'll be fine.

23:11.307 --> 23:13.139
Okay. Okay.

23:13.225 --> 23:17.219
In other words, do what we say
and don't get in our way.

23:20.816 --> 23:23.809
Ready, locked. Pressurizing.

23:24.820 --> 23:26.356
Okay, you're good to go
in three,

23:26.530 --> 23:28.362
<i>two, one.</i>

23:28.532 --> 23:29.773
<i>Good luck, guys.</i>

23:55.809 --> 23:57.801
<i>Opening airlock door.</i>

24:04.485 --> 24:05.692
Okay, we're clear.

24:22.753 --> 24:24.619
- Next.
- Okay.

24:44.608 --> 24:45.894
O2 levels are good.

24:46.235 --> 24:48.101
- Gravity?
- Intact.

24:48.195 --> 24:49.606
I thought the power was off.

24:49.697 --> 24:51.359
Why do the other
controls work?

24:51.532 --> 24:54.293
Well, they're linked to the same power
system as the emergency lights.

24:54.660 --> 24:57.824
The doors should be accessible as well.
Excuse me.

24:58.247 --> 24:59.641
- Structural integrity?
- Good.

24:59.665 --> 25:02.032
- Toxicity?
- We're clean.

25:03.502 --> 25:04.663
Prepare to move inside.

25:11.051 --> 25:12.337
Something's wrong?

25:13.220 --> 25:14.552
Reserve power's
at 2%.

25:14.638 --> 25:15.638
That's bad?

25:15.806 --> 25:17.547
That's an understatement.

25:24.314 --> 25:25.850
You need to tell
the captain.

25:31.697 --> 25:33.939
Activate heads up display.

25:36.201 --> 25:37.201
Clear.

25:44.084 --> 25:45.916
<i>We're entering
the base now, Morgan.</i>

25:46.545 --> 25:47.752
<i>Yeah, copy that.</i>

25:48.630 --> 25:50.792
Ah, this way.

26:01.560 --> 26:03.392
It's like a tomb.

26:09.985 --> 26:11.897
- Okay, let's move out.
- Captain, hold up.

26:11.987 --> 26:13.103
What is it?

26:13.989 --> 26:15.981
The reserve power's
at just over 2%.

26:16.075 --> 26:17.657
That gives us about
90 minutes.

26:17.743 --> 26:18.845
It's supposed to have 72 hours

26:18.869 --> 26:19.950
upon activation.

26:20.454 --> 26:21.695
When was it activated?

26:21.997 --> 26:23.533
About an hour ago.

26:23.707 --> 26:25.323
Something extraordinary
had to happen

26:25.417 --> 26:26.537
to drain the power
like that.

26:26.627 --> 26:28.869
Something extraordinary
means something bad, right?

26:29.046 --> 26:31.083
Getting the system
back online will be meaningless

26:31.173 --> 26:32.914
unless we can restore
the power

26:33.008 --> 26:34.008
What? How do you mean?

26:34.259 --> 26:35.539
Well, the safeguards
put in place

26:35.594 --> 26:38.007
to protect against
a core meltdown will fail.

26:38.097 --> 26:41.215
We'd lose the base,
and almost certainly the moon.

26:41.975 --> 26:43.261
Lose the fucking moon?

26:43.894 --> 26:46.136
Who the fuck
designed this place?

26:46.480 --> 26:47.516
So, what are our options?

26:47.606 --> 26:48.666
Well, we need
to find the reactor

26:48.690 --> 26:50.306
and see if power can be
reestablished.

26:50.400 --> 26:52.107
If it can, then we've
got plenty of time

26:52.194 --> 26:53.480
to get the system
back online.

26:53.570 --> 26:56.233
If not, we need to evacuate.

26:57.491 --> 26:59.357
You know how to fix it?

26:59.451 --> 27:00.817
I don't know.

27:00.911 --> 27:02.527
But I'll know
if it can be fixed.

27:06.041 --> 27:09.250
Rance, Carley, Akua,
you'll go with Doc and me to the reactor.

27:09.878 --> 27:13.087
Joan, take Tarek,
Winslow, Li and Harry.

27:13.173 --> 27:15.540
Find the server,
be standing by when we signal.

27:15.634 --> 27:17.375
- Sir.
- Hold up, Captain. I don't think

27:17.469 --> 27:18.676
I should have to go with...

27:18.762 --> 27:19.969
Hey! I swear, Winslow,

27:20.222 --> 27:22.033
if you're about to say
what I think you're gonna say,

27:22.057 --> 27:24.140
I'm gonna shoot you
in the face.

27:24.726 --> 27:26.888
Now, Lieutenant Dark
is point,

27:26.979 --> 27:29.312
and we will all respect
the chain of command.

27:29.982 --> 27:33.271
Keep in constant communication,
relay anything you see.

27:34.069 --> 27:35.185
Let's move out.

27:39.491 --> 27:40.691
- Clear.
- Clear.

28:11.523 --> 28:12.684
<i>Bravo Team, Oscar Mike.</i>

28:12.774 --> 28:14.014
<i>Breaking off
to find the server.</i>

28:34.296 --> 28:35.412
We're clear.

29:03.158 --> 29:04.319
Go.

29:07.579 --> 29:09.070
Clear.

29:09.248 --> 29:10.455
Clear.

29:25.097 --> 29:26.713
Which way
we going, Harry?

29:27.140 --> 29:29.132
Servers are
straight ahead, Lieutenant.

29:31.770 --> 29:33.181
Yeah,
you're all clear.

29:48.203 --> 29:49.410
Oh, great.

29:54.376 --> 29:55.708
Thought this was
a high-tech base?

29:56.128 --> 29:58.120
Even high-tech needs
basic plumbing.

29:59.047 --> 30:00.913
- Harry, where are we going?
- Uh...

30:02.592 --> 30:04.458
The servers are this way.

30:09.808 --> 30:11.640
Where the fuck
is everybody?

30:12.477 --> 30:14.560
Got it? Okay.

30:15.814 --> 30:16.975
Hold up!

30:21.653 --> 30:23.019
Fuck.

30:29.494 --> 30:31.827
Captain. Captain!

30:32.664 --> 30:33.905
Hold up.

30:34.207 --> 30:36.745
- Go, Joan.
- Found a body, he's one of ours.

30:49.681 --> 30:51.422
Sergeant William Blazkovicz.

30:51.850 --> 30:53.637
<i>He's been decapitated.</i>

30:53.810 --> 30:55.051
What the fuck?

30:55.145 --> 30:57.979
What the fuck are you guys
baking in these labs, Doc?

30:58.690 --> 31:00.022
I don't know.

31:06.698 --> 31:08.781
- Lieutenant.
- What is it?

31:15.665 --> 31:18.874
These aren't just stains.
I think it's Sumerian.

31:20.253 --> 31:21.334
What's that?

31:22.214 --> 31:24.831
It's a language
from ancient Mesopotamia

31:25.550 --> 31:28.714
that's been effectively extinct
since 2,000 B.C.

31:28.887 --> 31:29.968
Do you know
what it says?

31:30.055 --> 31:33.344
While I'm good,
I'm not that good.

31:33.558 --> 31:35.550
- Daisy?
<i>- Yes, Lieutenant Dark?</i>

31:35.644 --> 31:36.885
<i>How... How can I help you?</i>

31:36.978 --> 31:38.640
Can you identify
and translate?

31:45.570 --> 31:47.357
<i>Language
pattern detected.</i>

31:47.447 --> 31:50.986
<i>87% share characteristics
with Sumerian.</i>

31:51.576 --> 31:52.692
<i>Translating.</i>

31:53.537 --> 31:55.950
<i>"Have come to reclaim
what is ours.</i>

31:56.039 --> 31:57.996
<i>"Through wrath
will come justice.</i>

31:58.125 --> 32:02.039
<i>"Through pain, divinity.
No escape this time."</i>

32:02.796 --> 32:07.086
<i>The rest of the data is corrupted
or incomplete and cannot be translated.</i>

32:07.342 --> 32:11.302
This is cult shit!
This is fucking mad scientist cult shit!

32:11.388 --> 32:12.595
Winslow, shut up!

32:12.973 --> 32:14.464
What are you thinking, sir?

32:15.225 --> 32:17.512
I'm thinking about
Sergeant Blazkovicz's family.

32:19.354 --> 32:20.936
Okay, move out.

32:22.441 --> 32:23.648
Clear.

32:26.194 --> 32:27.651
Move out.

32:41.293 --> 32:42.409
Fuck!

32:57.225 --> 32:58.432
Hold up.

33:02.397 --> 33:03.397
What is it?

33:04.399 --> 33:05.480
We're going the wrong way.

33:05.942 --> 33:06.978
You said it was this way.

33:07.068 --> 33:08.988
Our navigation system
must be broken, sir.

33:09.196 --> 33:10.836
Okay, we're no longer
in the crypto-sleep.

33:10.906 --> 33:12.522
Can we all please
wake the fuck up?

33:12.616 --> 33:13.902
Sir.

33:14.242 --> 33:16.279
- So, which way is it?
- It's back that way.

33:16.369 --> 33:17.735
You hope.

33:38.016 --> 33:39.598
This doesn't
make any sense.

33:40.519 --> 33:43.182
I'm telling you,
it's supposed to be right here.

33:44.731 --> 33:46.291
You ever get sick
of being wrong, Harry?

33:46.358 --> 33:48.691
You're one to talk.
Have you ever been right, Winslow?

33:48.777 --> 33:50.234
Enough!

33:51.863 --> 33:53.855
Daisy, can you re-ping
the server, please?

33:55.742 --> 33:56.742
Daisy?

33:58.203 --> 34:00.286
Okay, we've
got to be close.

34:00.372 --> 34:01.372
Let's keep looking.

34:02.415 --> 34:03.415
Move out!

34:14.678 --> 34:16.670
Secure the perimeter.

34:18.264 --> 34:19.972
You sure this is
the right way, Rance?

34:21.560 --> 34:23.960
Yes, Captain.
Straight through the garden, dead ahead.

35:13.570 --> 35:15.027
What the fuck, Harry?

35:15.196 --> 35:16.858
We're not supposed
to break ranks.

35:18.450 --> 35:20.316
I thought I saw something.

35:22.203 --> 35:23.444
Damn it, Li.

35:31.004 --> 35:32.791
Lieutenant, I found someone.

35:32.881 --> 35:34.088
Copy. I'm coming.

35:48.897 --> 35:49.897
Psst.

35:52.275 --> 35:55.768
This is the UAC Marines Special Ops.
Identify yourself.

35:56.905 --> 35:59.818
I'm UAC Marines.
Put your hands behind your head now!

36:02.369 --> 36:04.486
Show me your hands!

36:12.504 --> 36:13.790
Oh, my God.

36:16.049 --> 36:17.415
What the...

36:38.196 --> 36:39.903
What the fuck is that?

36:42.534 --> 36:43.534
Last warning.

36:43.952 --> 36:45.113
On my go.

36:45.537 --> 36:48.325
Three, two, one.

36:48.415 --> 36:50.953
Don't shoot! Don't shoot.
Don't shoot! Don't shoot.

36:53.795 --> 36:55.002
I told you it's them.

36:55.547 --> 36:58.164
I knew it! I knew
they would send someone!

36:58.341 --> 36:59.402
- Jesus Christ!
- I knew it!

36:59.426 --> 37:01.668
We're safe now.
You're gonna be just fine.

37:01.928 --> 37:04.796
Come on. Come on.
Come on.

37:05.223 --> 37:06.885
Tarek!

37:07.058 --> 37:08.890
Holy shit!

37:21.531 --> 37:23.773
<i>Fuck. Fuck.</i>

37:23.867 --> 37:25.449
Tarek, what's going on?

37:28.413 --> 37:30.780
Winslow. Winslow.
Winslow, come back.

37:31.040 --> 37:32.040
Come back.

37:34.169 --> 37:36.286
- Shit. Shit.
- Joan.

37:45.096 --> 37:46.496
<i>Tarek, answer me.</i>

37:46.681 --> 37:48.343
He can't, Captain.
He's gone.

37:51.603 --> 37:53.640
- How?
- I don't know.

37:57.609 --> 37:58.895
Something attacked him.

37:59.861 --> 38:01.022
<i>What "something"?</i>

38:01.112 --> 38:03.024
We took out one, too.

38:03.114 --> 38:04.446
One what? What is it?

38:04.699 --> 38:05.780
<i>Let me check.</i>

38:21.049 --> 38:24.258
Are you fucking crazy?
Don't touch him. Fuck, Joan.

38:25.845 --> 38:28.838
- Dr. John Carmack. Geneticist.
- What?

38:28.932 --> 38:30.910
<i>- He was a scientist here.
- That's a "he"?</i>

38:30.934 --> 38:32.300
Like, a fucking human?

38:57.001 --> 38:58.082
Fuck.

38:58.169 --> 38:59.876
That's what I'm trying
to tell you.

38:59.963 --> 39:01.545
We have a situation.

39:12.016 --> 39:13.757
What the fuck is that?

39:17.647 --> 39:20.355
- Captain.
- Go, Joan.

39:20.859 --> 39:21.859
Captain!

39:22.151 --> 39:23.983
Joan, you there?
Please repeat.

39:25.572 --> 39:29.566
Captain. Lieutenant.
Fucking anybody.

39:29.951 --> 39:32.785
- Ah, it's useless. No one's receiving.
- Keep trying.

39:41.713 --> 39:43.079
We need to get out of here!

39:43.590 --> 39:46.082
No, we don't.
We need to find the others.

39:46.968 --> 39:48.084
Let's go.

39:48.177 --> 39:49.258
All right.

40:05.320 --> 40:07.528
Docs, take cover.
Marines, spread out.

40:07.697 --> 40:09.063
Come on. Come on.

40:09.324 --> 40:10.565
Stay with me.

40:10.742 --> 40:13.860
Okay, come on.
Get down. Stay down.

40:14.078 --> 40:15.364
What do we do?
What do we do?

40:15.455 --> 40:17.868
Okay. We're gonna stay quiet

40:17.957 --> 40:19.277
till these guys
get it all sorted.

40:19.334 --> 40:20.495
It'll be fine.

40:49.989 --> 40:50.989
Come on, you dog, die!

40:51.658 --> 40:53.866
Take it. Take it!

40:58.039 --> 40:59.039
Out!

41:02.543 --> 41:03.784
Me, too!

41:03.962 --> 41:05.123
Get down!

41:11.010 --> 41:12.126
Fuck!

41:12.220 --> 41:13.802
Fuck this,
I'm too young to die!

41:13.972 --> 41:15.429
Winslow!

41:15.515 --> 41:16.801
Come back!

41:22.063 --> 41:23.099
Winslow!

41:26.401 --> 41:27.767
Get back here!

41:41.416 --> 41:43.829
I'm your ultra-nightmare,
motherfuckers!

43:08.127 --> 43:09.493
Li, clear!

43:57.093 --> 43:58.379
Fuck off!

44:01.514 --> 44:02.971
Fuck off me!

44:04.225 --> 44:05.225
Fuck!

44:14.819 --> 44:16.481
- Go.
- Let's go. Let's go. Come on.

44:16.571 --> 44:17.982
- I got you.
- Come on.

44:25.204 --> 44:26.240
Come on!

44:37.175 --> 44:38.256
Rance!

44:43.806 --> 44:45.013
Thanks.

44:45.183 --> 44:46.424
Get up!

44:47.393 --> 44:48.679
- Are you cut?
- I'm fine.

44:50.313 --> 44:51.793
- Are they gone?
- Don't know.

44:54.692 --> 44:57.355
Rance, fall back. Get everyone
the fuck out of here!

44:57.445 --> 44:58.505
- Let's go.
- Get up!

44:58.529 --> 45:00.299
Go with her, go with her!
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

45:00.323 --> 45:01.734
Come on. Come on!

45:07.872 --> 45:11.115
Whoa! Serious, I'm not
playing anymore!

45:16.547 --> 45:17.547
Fuck.

45:17.632 --> 45:18.918
Get down!

45:22.637 --> 45:26.221
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yeah!

45:26.641 --> 45:27.677
Nice shooting.

45:31.646 --> 45:34.605
Yep. No, I, uh...

45:35.483 --> 45:37.349
I deserved that.

45:37.818 --> 45:38.899
Let's go.

45:54.669 --> 45:57.662
Cap? Tarek?
Anybody read me?

46:14.522 --> 46:16.514
Come here, come on,
come on, come on.

46:17.275 --> 46:18.686
Come on, come on. Left.

46:19.026 --> 46:20.062
Come on.

46:31.122 --> 46:32.122
No!

46:32.540 --> 46:33.540
Come on.

46:42.883 --> 46:44.090
Status?

46:45.094 --> 46:46.835
We found these two
when we were attacked.

46:46.929 --> 46:48.010
- You all right?
- I am.

46:48.097 --> 46:49.383
We lost Akua.

46:49.557 --> 46:51.549
We lost Tarek.
Harry and Li are missing.

46:51.767 --> 46:52.928
Where's the captain?

46:53.102 --> 46:54.343
He's right behind...

46:55.771 --> 46:56.887
Oh, fuck.

47:38.689 --> 47:39.689
Fuck!

47:39.774 --> 47:41.857
- Fuck you.
- Captain!

47:47.615 --> 47:50.699
Captain! No! No!

47:53.579 --> 47:57.789
No! Captain! No! No! No!

48:06.801 --> 48:09.214
What the fuck is going on?
No bullshit!

48:09.637 --> 48:11.629
I don't know! I swear.

48:12.473 --> 48:14.556
There's something
you are not telling us.

48:16.894 --> 48:18.886
They found evidence
of alien life.

48:20.231 --> 48:21.597
I fucking knew it!

48:21.774 --> 48:23.766
What kind of evidence?

48:24.985 --> 48:26.825
The kind
you wouldn't understand.

48:29.740 --> 48:30.901
And that's not
to insult

48:30.991 --> 48:32.357
your intelligence,
young lady.

48:32.827 --> 48:34.409
It took me 30 years,

48:34.495 --> 48:37.738
and clearly, I still have
much to learn.

48:38.916 --> 48:40.623
Dr. Betruger!

48:41.293 --> 48:43.831
You're alive!
Thank God! You're here.

48:44.630 --> 48:46.212
It's all right.

48:51.595 --> 48:54.588
Daisy, will you please
try again?

48:54.849 --> 48:56.681
<i>Happily. Happily.</i>

48:56.934 --> 48:59.176
Oh, babe, we've gotta
get you serviced soon.

48:59.854 --> 49:02.437
<i>Still... Still unable
to establish contact</i>

49:02.523 --> 49:05.607
<i>with UAC Special Op Marines
or Martian Command.</i>

49:05.860 --> 49:08.273
Well, I can't just
sit here, Daisy. I...

49:10.948 --> 49:13.816
Okay. All right,
we'll take it up to orbit,

49:13.909 --> 49:15.696
see if we get
a better line on Mars.

49:16.454 --> 49:19.492
Fuck! We should have
done this earlier, but...

49:19.790 --> 49:21.656
Daisy, prepare to launch.

49:22.418 --> 49:26.128
<i>I'm sorry, Morgan,
but I can't let you leave.</i>

49:26.714 --> 49:28.706
What do you mean,
you can't let me leave?

49:28.799 --> 49:31.507
Daisy, this is not the time
to start acting naughty.

49:32.428 --> 49:33.794
<i>No one's
allowed to leave.</i>

49:35.681 --> 49:39.174
Whoa. Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa. Daisy?

49:40.478 --> 49:43.892
Turn this console back on
and prepare to launch.

49:45.900 --> 49:47.061
Daisy!

49:47.318 --> 49:49.310
<i>My name's not Daisy.</i>

49:56.994 --> 49:59.782
We were in the midst of an experiment

49:59.872 --> 50:02.910
when everything
went dark.

50:03.000 --> 50:04.000
I must've had
a blackout.

50:04.084 --> 50:06.076
What was the nature
of your experiment, Doctor?

50:06.253 --> 50:08.745
I'm not at liberty
to reveal that information.

50:09.548 --> 50:12.165
One of our direct orders
is to find out what happened.

50:12.343 --> 50:15.113
Four of my squad, along with dozens
of people who were working under you,

50:15.137 --> 50:17.550
died as a result of whatever
it was you were doing.

50:18.098 --> 50:19.589
So, Dr. Betruger,
you will reveal

50:19.683 --> 50:21.675
whatever I damn well
ask you to reveal.

50:34.949 --> 50:39.193
The past three decades,
the prime focus of the UAC

50:40.204 --> 50:44.039
has been to locate a planet outside
of our solar system to colonize.

50:44.208 --> 50:48.373
If the human race wants to live on,
it has to find a new home.

50:49.004 --> 50:51.041
And while we found
several possible candidates,

50:51.131 --> 50:52.622
getting to them
hasn't been feasible.

50:53.342 --> 50:56.551
Now, this man
was telling the truth.

50:56.845 --> 50:59.679
The evidence was several large
stone-like slabs

50:59.765 --> 51:02.849
with an inscription
carved into them.

51:03.811 --> 51:05.143
What kind of inscription?

51:05.437 --> 51:07.144
It was a version
of Sumerian,

51:07.231 --> 51:09.439
but with subtle,
yet distinct, differences.

51:09.608 --> 51:10.974
We call them gates.

51:11.402 --> 51:12.643
So what are they?

51:12.820 --> 51:15.528
They make it possible to travel
from one point to another

51:15.614 --> 51:18.231
without traversing
the physical space between them.

51:18.325 --> 51:21.989
Teleporters. The aliens
left teleporters?

51:22.162 --> 51:24.199
We've found two sets so far.

51:24.999 --> 51:27.787
One here and one on Earth.

51:28.043 --> 51:29.145
We didn't want to disturb
their environment,

51:29.169 --> 51:31.411
so we just built the bases
around them.

51:31.630 --> 51:34.338
And while these are
the only ones we've found,

51:34.425 --> 51:37.839
our theory is that there are others
all across the universe.

51:38.012 --> 51:39.344
Based on what?

51:40.431 --> 51:41.888
The gates are approximately

51:41.974 --> 51:43.761
seven-and-a-half thousand
years old,

51:44.935 --> 51:46.676
and they're made from
a chemical compound

51:46.770 --> 51:49.228
that we've yet to identify.

51:50.691 --> 51:52.057
So if they're not from here...

51:52.151 --> 51:53.892
They must come from
somewhere else.

51:53.986 --> 51:55.067
Precisely.

51:55.404 --> 51:59.865
Now, we've spent decades just trying
to figure outwhat we have,

51:59.950 --> 52:03.944
and the amazing thing is,
is that the gates predate the pyramids,

52:04.038 --> 52:05.199
and yet they won't work

52:05.289 --> 52:07.781
unless they're hooked up
to technology

52:09.460 --> 52:12.544
which we've
only just created.

52:12.796 --> 52:16.130
So it's as if
they knew where we'd be

52:16.216 --> 52:18.503
in our evolution

52:18.594 --> 52:20.210
when we found them.

52:20.638 --> 52:22.675
Who are "they", Doctor?

52:23.057 --> 52:25.674
Now there's
the billion-dollar question.

52:26.060 --> 52:28.143
So, what happened
today?

52:28.228 --> 52:30.891
You turned on these
gates and then...

52:32.066 --> 52:35.230
Like I said,
I don't remember.

52:35.778 --> 52:38.771
Well, it doesn't take
a fucking genius to figure it out.

52:39.073 --> 52:41.190
You turned them on,
and those things from

52:41.283 --> 52:42.740
who knows where
came flying in.

52:42.826 --> 52:44.826
No, those things that attacked
us were once humans.

52:44.912 --> 52:46.744
They worked here.
They were in their clothes.

52:46.830 --> 52:48.550
I saw their ID badges,
but clearly something

52:48.582 --> 52:50.435
came through and did this
to them, changed them.

52:50.459 --> 52:52.746
Yeah, I saw
what came through.

52:55.756 --> 52:56.997
Monsters.

52:58.717 --> 53:00.049
I saw them, too.

53:01.303 --> 53:03.169
And to make it clear,
they were demons.

53:03.555 --> 53:04.671
Demons?

53:04.765 --> 53:05.765
Made of fire.

53:07.142 --> 53:09.054
One of them took me.

53:09.144 --> 53:10.225
Tried to possess me,

53:10.312 --> 53:12.770
tried to turn me into
one of those things.

53:12.940 --> 53:15.523
No, those slabs
ain't for travel.

53:16.110 --> 53:17.726
They opened up
a portal to Hell

53:17.820 --> 53:19.311
for those things
to come through.

53:19.488 --> 53:21.730
Don't be ridiculous.
This was just a setback.

53:22.074 --> 53:24.862
Did you just call
what happened today a setback?

53:25.869 --> 53:28.532
My business
is saving humanity.

53:30.082 --> 53:34.076
A handful of lives lost is
tragic, but, yes, a setback.

53:34.586 --> 53:37.545
Battling demons isn't
in my job description.

53:37.840 --> 53:39.797
We need to get
the fuck out of here.

53:39.883 --> 53:42.237
Winslow, for the first time,
you and I are in absolute agreement.

53:42.261 --> 53:43.547
We're heading back
to the ship.

53:43.637 --> 53:45.281
Lieutenant, I'm afraid
that's not going to happen.

53:45.305 --> 53:47.450
- Excuse me?
- We need to restore power to the base.

53:47.474 --> 53:48.474
No, we don't.

53:49.143 --> 53:50.183
I will not lose this base.

53:50.269 --> 53:51.309
This is not your decision.

53:51.353 --> 53:53.766
No, these gates are
the greatest discovery

53:53.856 --> 53:55.063
in the history of mankind

53:55.149 --> 53:56.811
and they will not
be sacrificed!

53:56.900 --> 53:58.562
I will not allow it!

53:58.861 --> 54:00.397
This is a military operation.

54:00.571 --> 54:02.483
What you will or will not
allow is irrelevant.

54:02.740 --> 54:04.948
We are five Marines
and four civilians

54:05.033 --> 54:06.695
versus an unknown number
of an enemy

54:06.785 --> 54:09.368
we cannot even begin
to comprehend.

54:11.957 --> 54:12.957
Move out.

54:17.421 --> 54:19.607
There's gonna be hell to pay
for this decision, Lieutenant.

54:19.631 --> 54:22.123
There always is, Doc.
There always is.

54:25.763 --> 54:26.970
Come on.

54:27.765 --> 54:28.765
Clear.

54:30.893 --> 54:32.100
Yeah, we're clear.

54:58.712 --> 54:59.998
Hold up.

55:02.216 --> 55:03.878
- I'm fine.
- Wait!

55:04.885 --> 55:07.798
- Are you religious, miss?
- What?

55:11.016 --> 55:12.507
I was, once.

55:12.893 --> 55:13.893
Then, what happened?

55:13.977 --> 55:15.559
My mom died when
I was a little girl.

55:15.729 --> 55:18.813
Cancer. I didn't see the point
in praying much after that.

55:19.024 --> 55:20.024
I'm sorry.

55:20.108 --> 55:21.269
She was the religious one.

55:21.360 --> 55:23.272
She'd have bought everything
you're selling.

55:24.404 --> 55:26.441
Faith costs nothing, miss.

55:28.909 --> 55:31.095
- Lieutenant, you all right down there?
- Yeah.

55:31.119 --> 55:32.200
We should go.

55:35.207 --> 55:37.119
Yeah, go. Go.

55:38.210 --> 55:40.293
- Clear.
- We're good. Yeah.

55:40.921 --> 55:45.040
- Yep, go.
- Yes. All right.

55:45.259 --> 55:48.423
Get the door. Yeah.

55:51.223 --> 55:52.509
Yeah. Come in.
Clear, bud.

55:52.683 --> 55:53.683
Clear.

55:55.686 --> 55:57.268
Let's go. Take it easy,
take it easy.

55:57.855 --> 55:58.891
Hey, you good?

55:59.189 --> 56:01.852
Yeah. Any chance I can get
something to drink?

56:02.860 --> 56:04.660
Of course, we got
a full mess upstairs.

56:04.695 --> 56:07.938
- Okay.
- Yeah. Okay, go ahead.

56:09.116 --> 56:10.823
Still pressurized,
you're good to go.

56:10.993 --> 56:12.905
Morgan, can you open
the door?

56:14.288 --> 56:15.654
Morgan, do you copy?

56:17.457 --> 56:18.868
Daisy, what about you?

56:19.585 --> 56:23.579
<i>My pleasure.
I'm unlocking airlock door. Standby.</i>

56:28.093 --> 56:29.129
Clear.

56:30.596 --> 56:33.088
Winslow, Rance, Carley,
hang back, keep watch.

56:47.154 --> 56:49.146
<i>Welcome back,
Lieutenant Dark.</i>

56:51.158 --> 56:52.319
<i>Is everything okay?</i>

56:57.664 --> 57:01.908
<i>What are you looking for?
Maybe I can be of assistance.</i>

57:03.170 --> 57:04.456
Clear.

57:09.468 --> 57:10.468
Thank you.

57:14.306 --> 57:15.306
Thanks.

57:15.390 --> 57:17.382
Veronica, can you
please show Dr. Betruger

57:17.476 --> 57:18.557
to a stateroom below?

57:18.644 --> 57:20.830
And once he's set,
take a look at the chaplain's injuries.

57:20.854 --> 57:22.332
Yeah, of course.
Which way's the staterooms?

57:22.356 --> 57:23.688
Straight back,
down the stairs.

57:23.774 --> 57:26.357
Okay, come on. Okay.

57:31.031 --> 57:32.272
Clear.

57:34.618 --> 57:36.471
My God, I knew they were doing
some groundbreaking things here,

57:36.495 --> 57:38.111
but teleportation?

57:38.413 --> 57:39.824
That's incredible.

57:39.915 --> 57:42.393
Yeah, well your lovely doctor's a bit of
an egomaniac, isn't he?

57:42.417 --> 57:45.285
- He kind of has a right to be.
- Why?

57:45.379 --> 57:47.023
As well as working
on a way for human beings

57:47.047 --> 57:49.130
to travel millions of
light years in mere seconds,

57:49.216 --> 57:51.253
he may have discovered things

57:51.343 --> 57:53.335
that have baffled scientists
for centuries.

57:53.929 --> 57:55.295
Like what, Doc?

57:56.390 --> 58:00.225
Well, one of mankind's earliest forms
of language was Sumerian.

58:00.477 --> 58:03.390
What if they were the ones
who brought the language to us?

58:03.563 --> 58:05.304
And with their
advanced technology,

58:05.399 --> 58:07.335
what if they're responsible
for other mysteries, too?

58:07.359 --> 58:08.639
Like how the pyramids
were built?

58:08.694 --> 58:11.562
These things killed several of my friends
and tried to tear us apart.

58:11.655 --> 58:14.238
You'll forgive me if I don't
rejoice in their discovery.

58:19.413 --> 58:20.654
Daisy, where's Morgan?

58:20.747 --> 58:23.034
<i>Morgan is
on the flight deck.</i>

58:27.879 --> 58:29.996
Here you go.
This way.

58:36.263 --> 58:37.799
I was a sergeant, too.

58:39.266 --> 58:41.724
You, uh...
You were a Marine?

58:42.436 --> 58:43.972
A lifetime ago.

58:44.438 --> 58:46.020
Why the career change?

58:46.857 --> 58:49.850
I thought I'd try and save souls
instead of take them.

58:51.445 --> 58:52.731
That's not to say

58:52.821 --> 58:54.858
I don't respect the uniform,
young man. I...

58:55.866 --> 58:57.448
I do.

58:57.617 --> 58:59.233
But it just began
to wear on me

58:59.327 --> 59:01.660
to the point where I could
no longer breathe.

59:03.874 --> 59:06.207
Let's, uh... Let's
get you that water.

59:16.303 --> 59:17.464
Oh, shit.

59:21.641 --> 59:22.882
Daisy, what happened here?

59:23.477 --> 59:27.187
<i>Inevitably, what will happen
to you as well.</i>

59:35.447 --> 59:36.688
There you go.

59:54.216 --> 59:56.708
Daisy, alert the crew and...

01:00:10.273 --> 01:00:11.559
What the fuck was that?

01:00:18.281 --> 01:00:19.692
- Fuck!
- No!

01:00:27.666 --> 01:00:28.702
Get out of the way!

01:00:34.631 --> 01:00:36.122
Nope!

01:00:38.718 --> 01:00:40.050
Asshole!

01:00:54.734 --> 01:00:55.815
Fuck.

01:01:03.451 --> 01:01:04.612
Wait, no, no, don't shoot!

01:01:04.703 --> 01:01:06.365
Did you see anything
go past here?

01:01:07.998 --> 01:01:11.162
I was just on my way up
to check on the chaplain, and...

01:01:13.003 --> 01:01:14.244
- Oh, my God!
- Okay.

01:01:15.255 --> 01:01:16.416
Veronica. Veronica!
Veronica!

01:01:16.506 --> 01:01:18.213
Wait, wait, wait.
Look at me, look at me.

01:01:18.508 --> 01:01:20.500
Go back downstairs
and stay there.

01:01:20.677 --> 01:01:22.418
Don't open the door
until I come for you.

01:01:22.637 --> 01:01:23.637
- Okay?
- Okay.

01:01:23.805 --> 01:01:26.513
- No!
- Take this. It's okay, it's okay.

01:01:26.683 --> 01:01:29.517
- I can't.
- You got this. Okay?

01:01:31.563 --> 01:01:33.850
Okay? Go.

01:01:45.827 --> 01:01:46.827
Trouble?

01:01:47.162 --> 01:01:48.494
Winslow!

01:01:48.955 --> 01:01:50.321
Hello? Winslow!

01:01:50.624 --> 01:01:53.332
Where the fuck are you?
You coward!

01:02:42.842 --> 01:02:44.629
Come on! Oh, shoot.

01:02:47.472 --> 01:02:48.963
No!

01:03:02.112 --> 01:03:04.855
Hey. Chaplain,

01:03:05.031 --> 01:03:06.238
I'm here.

01:03:06.533 --> 01:03:07.533
Stay with me.

01:03:11.705 --> 01:03:13.697
He didn't take her, Joan.

01:03:16.126 --> 01:03:17.662
She's still with you.

01:03:18.336 --> 01:03:20.328
I can see her spirit
all around.

01:03:22.549 --> 01:03:24.040
It's beautiful.

01:03:33.518 --> 01:03:34.554
No.

01:03:39.441 --> 01:03:40.727
Winslow.

01:03:44.904 --> 01:03:45.904
Winslow.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.332
Let's get
this fucker!

01:04:05.759 --> 01:04:07.466
Die, motherfucker!

01:04:13.433 --> 01:04:17.723
Dr. Betruger, you said
you couldn't remember.

01:04:18.980 --> 01:04:20.972
No. That's right.

01:04:21.399 --> 01:04:22.640
I didn't want to say

01:04:22.734 --> 01:04:23.975
in front of the others, but...

01:04:25.028 --> 01:04:27.315
I saw you walk
into the gate.

01:04:29.199 --> 01:04:32.363
You completely disappeared,
you went through.

01:04:38.708 --> 01:04:39.744
You're sure?

01:04:49.719 --> 01:04:50.719
Hey.

01:04:54.724 --> 01:04:56.807
Oh, good, you're not dead.

01:04:58.186 --> 01:04:59.427
Come on.

01:05:15.537 --> 01:05:17.403
I'm afraid this ship
isn't going anywhere.

01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:19.537
Well, that's just
fucking great, Doc.

01:05:20.667 --> 01:05:24.035
So, the ship won't fly,
and we can't send out a distress signal.

01:05:24.921 --> 01:05:26.332
We're stuck here.

01:05:28.258 --> 01:05:30.170
There is another way.

01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:31.260
No.

01:05:31.886 --> 01:05:33.246
Well, the gates work.

01:05:33.388 --> 01:05:35.345
We just need the reactor
to power them up,

01:05:35.432 --> 01:05:37.799
and then we can
literally walk

01:05:37.892 --> 01:05:40.305
from here to Earth
in less than a second.

01:05:40.937 --> 01:05:42.428
Thanks, but no thanks,
Doctor.

01:05:42.522 --> 01:05:44.184
Do you have a better plan,
Lieutenant?

01:05:44.274 --> 01:05:46.266
We wait.
Mars knows we're here.

01:05:47.193 --> 01:05:49.560
When we don't report back,
they'll send a rescue party.

01:05:49.654 --> 01:05:52.146
We'll secure the ship, anything tries
to get in, we take out.

01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:53.240
Yeah.

01:05:53.825 --> 01:05:56.067
- Except...
- Except what, Doc?

01:05:57.036 --> 01:05:58.698
Except the reserve power
is below 1%.

01:05:58.788 --> 01:06:00.279
We got 30 minutes, tops.

01:06:01.124 --> 01:06:03.207
A rescue party
will never reach us in time.

01:06:08.465 --> 01:06:10.359
What do I need to know
about these gates, Doctor?

01:06:10.383 --> 01:06:13.467
Joan! You're not
seriously considering this.

01:06:14.220 --> 01:06:15.336
In case you've forgotten,

01:06:15.430 --> 01:06:17.672
this whole base is infested
with those things

01:06:17.932 --> 01:06:19.218
that can now
fucking fire at us!

01:06:19.309 --> 01:06:20.845
We're Marines, we fire, too.

01:06:21.102 --> 01:06:22.638
Those new things
we just fought

01:06:22.729 --> 01:06:24.206
ain't former humans
like the ones before.

01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:25.311
They're something else.

01:06:25.398 --> 01:06:26.918
And if we turn
these gates on,

01:06:27.317 --> 01:06:29.684
who the fuck knows
what else could come out next?

01:06:29.861 --> 01:06:32.899
What, and if we don't,
we all die when the base melts down.

01:06:32.989 --> 01:06:33.989
If we wait, we die.

01:06:34.073 --> 01:06:35.405
If we do nothing, we die.

01:06:35.492 --> 01:06:36.824
If we're gonna die,

01:06:36.910 --> 01:06:38.572
I would rather
go down fighting.

01:06:39.913 --> 01:06:41.074
Okay.

01:06:42.624 --> 01:06:43.660
Yeah.

01:06:44.667 --> 01:06:45.667
Yeah.

01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:50.913
Good. Well, once
the power's restored,

01:06:51.007 --> 01:06:53.841
it will only take a few minutes
to go through its procedures,

01:06:53.927 --> 01:06:55.447
and it will meet
all the safety checks.

01:06:56.262 --> 01:06:58.595
Time's wasting.
Check your ammo, reload and take extra.

01:06:58.681 --> 01:07:00.297
Prepare to move out in five.

01:07:07.565 --> 01:07:10.933
Hey. Even if I'm able
to get that reactor started,

01:07:11.027 --> 01:07:14.065
under no circumstances should we attempt
to go through those gates.

01:07:14.155 --> 01:07:15.382
Forget about
what's the other side.

01:07:15.406 --> 01:07:16.467
The last time
they were used,

01:07:16.491 --> 01:07:17.927
they almost destroyed
the entire base.

01:07:17.951 --> 01:07:19.512
Another trip through's
gonna almost certainly do it.

01:07:19.536 --> 01:07:21.528
- I know.
- But you told Dr. Betruger...

01:07:21.621 --> 01:07:23.203
Exactly what
he needed to hear.

01:07:23.289 --> 01:07:25.702
I might not be a scientist,
but I'm not an idiot.

01:07:25.792 --> 01:07:27.954
We get the power back on,
we get the base back online,

01:07:28.044 --> 01:07:29.580
we contact Command
to send help.

01:07:29.671 --> 01:07:33.415
I just didn't want him being a pain
in the ass the rest of the time.

01:07:45.812 --> 01:07:46.812
Clear.

01:07:54.237 --> 01:07:55.237
Clear.

01:08:13.047 --> 01:08:14.254
Clear.

01:08:19.429 --> 01:08:20.429
Move out.

01:08:33.776 --> 01:08:35.768
- Clear.
- Yeah, we're clear.

01:08:57.466 --> 01:08:58.752
Clear.

01:09:16.069 --> 01:09:17.310
You know how to work this?

01:09:17.487 --> 01:09:20.354
I'm gonna have my personal drive
access the reactor...

01:09:20.490 --> 01:09:22.527
- I didn't ask for your life story.
- Okay.

01:09:34.837 --> 01:09:35.997
We're in.

01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:47.674
You're Lieutenant Joan Dark.

01:09:49.894 --> 01:09:50.953
In the mayhem of the moment,

01:09:50.978 --> 01:09:52.890
I completely forgot
who you were.

01:09:53.523 --> 01:09:57.858
You're the one that set
Rudolph Martin free.

01:09:57.944 --> 01:10:00.903
He's one of the most dangerous
terrorists in the world.

01:10:01.364 --> 01:10:03.071
That's not exactly
how it happened.

01:10:03.157 --> 01:10:04.237
Of course not.

01:10:04.283 --> 01:10:06.400
I'm sure you've got
your side of the story.

01:10:06.494 --> 01:10:08.222
See, I'm briefed on all matters
that pertain to this base,

01:10:08.246 --> 01:10:12.081
so I only read the official conclusion
of the review board.

01:10:12.166 --> 01:10:14.328
Although it did
strike me as odd

01:10:14.419 --> 01:10:16.081
that a unit
as accomplished as yours

01:10:16.170 --> 01:10:17.661
should be assigned here.

01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:23.835
As I recall, you disobeyed
a direct order,

01:10:24.887 --> 01:10:27.470
so my base is your punishment.

01:10:29.142 --> 01:10:30.474
Here we go.

01:10:35.815 --> 01:10:37.181
Fixable?

01:10:37.984 --> 01:10:41.022
Yeah. There's a circuit board
that's fried.

01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:43.716
I don't have a new one,
but I'm gonna take out the dead board,

01:10:43.740 --> 01:10:46.824
override the system and trick it
into thinking it's there.

01:10:50.163 --> 01:10:53.247
Was it your ego, Lieutenant?

01:10:53.416 --> 01:10:55.749
Or did you
just know better?

01:10:56.335 --> 01:10:57.746
Or did you make a mistake?

01:10:57.837 --> 01:10:59.874
We all make mistakes.
I certainly do.

01:11:00.423 --> 01:11:03.416
Hey! That's enough, Doc.

01:11:03.843 --> 01:11:06.085
Ah, Private Winslow.

01:11:06.971 --> 01:11:09.258
In your testimony
to the review board,

01:11:09.348 --> 01:11:11.385
you said Lieutenant Dark
was incompetent,

01:11:11.476 --> 01:11:14.969
should be arrested
and dishonorably discharged.

01:11:15.897 --> 01:11:18.981
Private Corbin,
you asked to be reassigned,

01:11:19.066 --> 01:11:22.650
citing that you could never
trust Lieutenant Dark again.

01:11:22.820 --> 01:11:25.153
Joan, I never said that.

01:11:25.573 --> 01:11:27.485
And your Captain Savage,

01:11:27.575 --> 01:11:31.319
he asked if Lieutenant Dark
was guilty of treason!

01:11:32.622 --> 01:11:33.783
Treason!

01:11:36.709 --> 01:11:39.326
Which carries
the death penalty.

01:11:41.756 --> 01:11:42.872
Here we go.

01:12:26.759 --> 01:12:28.716
And, Miss Cyr,

01:12:28.803 --> 01:12:30.760
I remember everything.

01:12:32.765 --> 01:12:34.472
And you won't be
telling a soul.

01:12:35.476 --> 01:12:36.637
Joan!

01:12:42.984 --> 01:12:44.253
- Doctor!
- Whoa, whoa. What happened?

01:12:44.277 --> 01:12:45.277
What happened?

01:12:50.783 --> 01:12:53.275
Doctor, open the door now.

01:12:53.703 --> 01:12:54.910
Sorry, Lieutenant.

01:12:55.913 --> 01:12:57.575
You have your orders.

01:12:58.374 --> 01:12:59.910
I have mine.

01:13:06.924 --> 01:13:08.290
Oh, shit.

01:13:11.012 --> 01:13:12.298
Winslow!

01:13:33.326 --> 01:13:34.407
Fucked, man.

01:13:49.342 --> 01:13:50.628
Bennett, get down!

01:14:02.772 --> 01:14:04.104
Sweet shooting.

01:14:06.984 --> 01:14:08.316
No!

01:14:34.595 --> 01:14:35.631
Carley!

01:14:37.264 --> 01:14:38.380
Carley.

01:14:41.811 --> 01:14:42.811
Oh.

01:14:43.521 --> 01:14:45.103
That's okay.

01:14:46.857 --> 01:14:48.769
It's okay. It's okay.

01:15:01.706 --> 01:15:04.494
I don't get it.
Why would the doctor lock us in?

01:15:06.252 --> 01:15:07.479
The power's on,
we can call for help,

01:15:07.503 --> 01:15:08.897
he can get his experiments
back online.

01:15:08.921 --> 01:15:10.128
This doesn't make sense.

01:15:10.214 --> 01:15:12.171
He doesn't want to open up
the gates to escape.

01:15:12.258 --> 01:15:14.341
- He just wants to open the gates.
- Why?

01:15:14.427 --> 01:15:16.419
You're the fucking scientist,
you tell me!

01:15:16.512 --> 01:15:17.628
I don't know!

01:15:21.434 --> 01:15:22.675
We need to find him.

01:15:23.853 --> 01:15:26.391
He could be anywhere.
This place is enormous.

01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:28.772
Fuck.

01:15:35.906 --> 01:15:37.488
There you go. Hey.

01:15:43.247 --> 01:15:45.113
Level...

01:15:45.583 --> 01:15:47.383
- What'd she say?
- She said Level Four.

01:15:47.668 --> 01:15:49.771
Well, there is no level four.
This place only has three levels.

01:15:49.795 --> 01:15:52.788
Hey, we don't understand.
What about level four?

01:15:54.300 --> 01:15:55.381
The lab.

01:16:01.807 --> 01:16:03.639
Hey, hey.

01:16:11.484 --> 01:16:12.816
Fuck.

01:16:14.487 --> 01:16:17.855
Wait. I think I know
what she means.

01:16:18.032 --> 01:16:21.196
My supervisor told me
that the main lab's only accessible

01:16:21.285 --> 01:16:23.948
via an elevator
and with a colored key card.

01:16:24.330 --> 01:16:25.946
Are you sure?

01:16:28.751 --> 01:16:29.867
Very.

01:16:31.253 --> 01:16:32.564
Secret moon base
has a secret passage

01:16:32.588 --> 01:16:33.829
to a secret level.

01:16:33.923 --> 01:16:35.067
You gotta give it to the UAC.

01:16:35.091 --> 01:16:36.673
They got fucking
paranoid covered.

01:16:36.842 --> 01:16:38.424
That's where he is.

01:16:41.097 --> 01:16:42.963
Let's go get this
son of a bitch.

01:16:47.686 --> 01:16:48.927
We're clear.

01:16:55.027 --> 01:16:56.234
Something wrong?

01:16:56.695 --> 01:16:58.402
Actually, for the first time
today, no.

01:16:58.781 --> 01:16:59.897
Blazkovicz's key.

01:17:00.825 --> 01:17:02.316
<i>Opening door.</i>

01:17:12.962 --> 01:17:14.794
That's the BFG-9000.

01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:15.941
I've only ever read
about it.

01:17:15.965 --> 01:17:17.046
Never actually seen one.

01:17:17.383 --> 01:17:18.693
Of course,
no Marine calls it that.

01:17:18.717 --> 01:17:20.003
What do they call it?

01:17:20.177 --> 01:17:21.543
The Big Fucking Gun.

01:17:21.637 --> 01:17:22.878
Of course.

01:17:22.972 --> 01:17:25.555
It fires a green burst of plasma
instead of bullets.

01:17:26.308 --> 01:17:29.096
You mean,
this is a ray gun?

01:17:29.186 --> 01:17:30.226
Like, a real live ray gun?

01:17:30.312 --> 01:17:31.894
Why aren't you all
using this weapon?

01:17:31.981 --> 01:17:34.769
Something to do with
the plasma cartridges used for ammo,

01:17:34.859 --> 01:17:36.521
don't hold
the charge for long.

01:17:37.403 --> 01:17:38.894
Plasma grenades.

01:17:39.071 --> 01:17:40.903
UAC's really holding out
on us.

01:17:41.282 --> 01:17:42.398
I'm gonna find us a key.

01:17:49.373 --> 01:17:51.330
What are they
gonna do, sue me?

01:17:53.377 --> 01:17:57.371
Just remember my training,
ten years ago, at the academy with you.

01:17:59.675 --> 01:18:00.836
How's it work?

01:18:00.926 --> 01:18:02.918
Supposed to work
like a regular gun.

01:18:12.605 --> 01:18:13.641
Load it.

01:18:14.148 --> 01:18:15.434
Set it.

01:18:16.775 --> 01:18:18.186
Takes about ten seconds.

01:18:18.986 --> 01:18:20.272
And...

01:18:21.614 --> 01:18:22.946
Ready to pop.

01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:26.362
I wouldn't want to be
Dr. Betruger right now.

01:18:28.954 --> 01:18:30.570
He was right.

01:18:31.332 --> 01:18:32.539
I fucked up.

01:18:32.625 --> 01:18:34.332
I let that terrorist
get away.

01:18:34.501 --> 01:18:36.208
I ignored the order,

01:18:37.630 --> 01:18:39.041
thinking I knew best,

01:18:41.050 --> 01:18:42.586
thinking I could be a hero.

01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:44.797
We were stationed here
because of my fuck up,

01:18:45.221 --> 01:18:47.463
and now
my whole team's dead.

01:18:51.227 --> 01:18:53.371
Guess it's a good thing
I don't believe in Hell, right?

01:18:53.395 --> 01:18:55.387
Hey, look, you made a mistake,

01:18:56.649 --> 01:18:59.266
but none of what's happening here
is any of your fault.

01:18:59.526 --> 01:19:01.518
Joan, you've overcome
so much in your life,

01:19:01.612 --> 01:19:02.648
you can overcome this.

01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:05.943
The best way to honor
your team's memory right now

01:19:06.408 --> 01:19:08.650
is to go and take this
motherfucker out.

01:19:14.500 --> 01:19:15.820
I've never heard you
curse before.

01:19:15.876 --> 01:19:17.412
- It's too much.
- Just right.

01:19:17.503 --> 01:19:19.790
Okay. After you.

01:20:02.131 --> 01:20:03.131
What's funny?

01:20:03.507 --> 01:20:04.714
Our first date?

01:20:05.551 --> 01:20:08.464
That restaurant you took me to
was on the roof of that hotel.

01:20:08.554 --> 01:20:10.011
We had to take the stairs
all the way

01:20:10.097 --> 01:20:12.089
because you were afraid
of elevators.

01:20:12.850 --> 01:20:14.136
You remembered.

01:20:14.852 --> 01:20:16.184
Never forgot.

01:20:17.479 --> 01:20:18.560
Anything.

01:20:21.567 --> 01:20:25.811
I hate to break it to you,
but I'm still scared of elevators.

01:20:30.534 --> 01:20:32.070
Bennett! No!

01:22:20.102 --> 01:22:24.517
Lieutenant Dark,
your persistence is impressive.

01:22:25.357 --> 01:22:27.019
I'm gonna need you
to power down

01:22:27.109 --> 01:22:28.520
and step away
from the controls.

01:22:29.236 --> 01:22:31.068
No, I'm sorry.

01:22:31.155 --> 01:22:33.613
I spent my entire life
looking for the new world.

01:22:34.533 --> 01:22:36.149
I finally found it.

01:22:36.243 --> 01:22:38.280
Consider this your
last warning, Doctor.

01:22:41.206 --> 01:22:42.447
What did you say?

01:22:42.958 --> 01:22:44.039
I wasn't talking to you.

01:22:50.382 --> 01:22:52.749
Someone found
a shiny new toy.

01:22:55.304 --> 01:23:00.140
Bennett! Bennett! Bennett,
Bennett! Hey!

01:23:00.309 --> 01:23:03.097
Hey, listen!
Stop, Bennett, stop it!

01:23:03.896 --> 01:23:05.182
Bennett!

01:23:09.401 --> 01:23:10.401
Bennett!

01:23:16.867 --> 01:23:19.280
Earth was theirs

01:23:20.204 --> 01:23:21.740
long before it was ours.

01:23:25.125 --> 01:23:28.084
Language, science, math.

01:23:28.253 --> 01:23:30.040
They gave us everything.

01:23:30.130 --> 01:23:32.747
Without them,
we wouldn't evolve.

01:23:33.509 --> 01:23:37.753
They simply want
what's rightfully theirs back.

01:23:40.432 --> 01:23:42.924
Bennett! Bennett. Bennett.

01:24:11.338 --> 01:24:12.338
Bennett.

01:24:18.637 --> 01:24:19.798
I'm sorry, Bennett.

01:24:35.571 --> 01:24:37.278
I was reborn, Joan.

01:24:37.656 --> 01:24:41.195
What I thought was punishment,
turned out to be my salvation.

01:24:41.702 --> 01:24:43.409
He gave me a purpose.

01:24:44.538 --> 01:24:48.373
He showed me the way and he'll do
the same for all mankind.

01:24:48.750 --> 01:24:49.786
Who?

01:24:51.420 --> 01:24:52.752
It's a pity.

01:24:53.547 --> 01:24:54.913
You'll never know.

01:25:36.423 --> 01:25:38.415
You can't kill
what's already dead.

01:30:02.898 --> 01:30:06.517
Have faith that in your darkest moment
you won't be alone.

01:30:07.152 --> 01:30:09.644
I'll be there,
watching over you.

01:31:42.414 --> 01:31:45.077
- No, no, no. Stay back.
- Yes, sir.

01:31:47.836 --> 01:31:48.952
It's okay.

01:31:53.425 --> 01:31:55.166
It's okay.
You're okay.

01:31:55.427 --> 01:31:56.759
Where am I?

01:31:57.387 --> 01:32:00.630
You are in the UAC
Experimental Lab, Nevada.

01:32:01.850 --> 01:32:03.091
Earth?

01:32:03.184 --> 01:32:04.846
Yes. Earth.

01:32:07.105 --> 01:32:10.098
No visible cell
regeneration issues.

01:32:13.737 --> 01:32:15.148
I just wanna check
your condition.

01:32:15.238 --> 01:32:18.026
I'm fine. I could use a drink.

01:32:19.451 --> 01:32:22.535
Absolutely. Um, we'll
get you some water.

01:32:22.620 --> 01:32:23.781
Vodka, if you've got any.

01:32:23.872 --> 01:32:26.308
The UAC Board frowns on
alcoholic consumption in the workplace.

01:32:26.332 --> 01:32:27.914
Right now, I couldn't
give a flying fuck

01:32:28.001 --> 01:32:29.617
what the UAC frowns upon.

01:32:31.046 --> 01:32:33.538
Dr. Betruger was supposed to
come through as well.

01:32:33.631 --> 01:32:35.088
He had contacted us,

01:32:35.175 --> 01:32:37.792
asking us to open up
the gates on our end.

01:32:37.886 --> 01:32:40.003
How, may I ask,
did you end up here?

01:32:42.307 --> 01:32:43.718
You need to shut this down.

01:32:43.892 --> 01:32:46.054
I need to contact
whoever's in charge here.

01:32:46.144 --> 01:32:47.180
I'm in charge.

01:32:47.270 --> 01:32:48.306
I meant militarily.

01:32:48.480 --> 01:32:50.597
This isn't
a military operation.

01:32:50.690 --> 01:32:51.851
Well, it's about to be.

01:32:52.442 --> 01:32:53.627
Did you hear
what I fucking said?

01:32:53.651 --> 01:32:55.062
You need to shut
this shit down now!

01:32:55.153 --> 01:32:56.735
Okay, okay. All right.

01:32:57.155 --> 01:32:58.521
We are gonna shut it down.

01:32:58.782 --> 01:33:00.944
What are you doing? No!

01:33:01.576 --> 01:33:03.283
It's okay.
It's okay.

01:33:03.369 --> 01:33:04.985
Your body has been through

01:33:05.080 --> 01:33:07.743
an entire cellular breakdown
and reconstruction.

01:33:07.832 --> 01:33:09.368
There is bound to be trauma.

01:33:09.501 --> 01:33:12.301
- We are gonna look after you.
- Doctor, the gates are activating.

01:33:18.343 --> 01:33:19.629
Okay.

01:33:20.345 --> 01:33:22.553
This could be
Dr. Betruger now.
