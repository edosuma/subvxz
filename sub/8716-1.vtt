[men yelling]

00:41.291 --> 00:43.250
[man whistles]

00:47.250 --> 00:49.625
- COME ON! COME ON, NOW!

00:53.667 --> 00:56.458
[horse whinnying]

01:08.625 --> 01:11.834
[horse whinnying]

01:23.500 --> 01:26.000
- [man yelling]

01:26.000 --> 01:28.166
- HO! HO! HO, HO!

01:42.083 --> 01:44.667
- IT'S BEEN ALMOST A YEAR
SINCE I LEFT MY HOME IN THE EAST

01:44.667 --> 01:48.208
AND TRAVELED WEST
WITH THE MAN I LOVED.

01:48.208 --> 01:50.417
I WAS POSITIVE ABOUT MY FUTURE--

01:50.417 --> 01:52.542
FULL OF HOPES AND DREAMS.

01:52.542 --> 01:53.542
OUR EYES WERE ALWAYS
ON THE END OF THE TRAIL,

01:53.542 --> 01:54.250
AS IF LIFE AS I

01:54.250 --> 01:58.500
VISI
WOULD BE JUST THAT.

01:58.500 --> 01:59.667
IN FACT, IF SOMEONE HAD TOLD ME

01:59.667 --> 02:02.750
THAT I WOULD FIND MYSELF HERE
TODAY,

02:02.750 --> 02:05.250
I WOULD HAVE CALLED THEM CRAZY.

02:05.250 --> 02:08.542
I WAS SURE OF MYSELF
AND WHERE I WAS HEADED,

02:08.542 --> 02:11.875
STUBBORN, FULL OF PRIDE.

02:11.875 --> 02:14.166
I WAS IN CONTROL.

02:14.166 --> 02:15.458
OR SO I THOUGHT.

02:15.458 --> 02:18.083
- QUIT ACTING LIKE A KID, MARTY.
GET BACK HERE.

02:18.083 --> 02:19.291
- NO.

02:19.291 --> 02:20.875
NOT UNTIL YOU ADMIT
THAT I AM RIGHT

02:20.875 --> 02:22.125
AND HEAD THIS WAY.

02:22.125 --> 02:23.875
- WE'RE GOING
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

02:23.875 --> 02:25.208
- WE'RE GOING NORTH!

02:25.208 --> 02:27.208
- MR. GRAHAM SAID TO GO NORTH.

02:27.208 --> 02:29.500
- HE SAID TO GO NORTHWEST.

02:29.500 --> 02:32.083
DON'T YOU THINK IT'S STRANGE
WE HAVEN'T COME UPON IT YET?

02:34.083 --> 02:35.750
- WELL, WE'D BE THERE ALREADY

02:35.750 --> 02:38.291
IF THE WEIGHT OF THESE BOOKS
HADN'T SLOWED US DOWN!

02:38.291 --> 02:40.250
- THOSE BOOKS WILL PROVIDE US
WITH A LITTLE CULTURE

02:40.250 --> 02:41.583
ONCE WE GET SETTLED.

02:41.583 --> 02:42.750
- OH, WELL, IT'S JUST TOO BAD

02:42.750 --> 02:44.041
WE CAN'T EAT
ANY OF THAT CULTURE.

02:44.041 --> 02:45.083
- UGH!

02:45.083 --> 02:46.417
- THAT 200 POUNDS
OF BEANS AND RICE

02:46.417 --> 02:48.458
THAT WE HAD TO TOSS OFF
THE WAGON TO LESSEN THE WEIGHT

02:48.458 --> 02:50.375
WOULD TASTE A WHOLE LOT BETTER
RIGHT NOW

02:50.375 --> 02:52.625
THAN THE 200 POUNDS OF BOOKS
WE GOT!

02:52.625 --> 02:54.291
- NONE OF THIS
WOULD HAVE HAPPENED

02:54.291 --> 02:55.959
IF YOU HADN'T TALKED ME INTO
COMING OUT HERE

02:55.959 --> 02:58.709
TO THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE,
AARON CLARIDGE!

02:58.709 --> 03:00.125
- [laughing] WE BOTH KNOW

03:00.125 --> 03:02.375
THAT YOU DON'T DO ANYTHING
YOU DON'T WANT TO DO.

03:02.375 --> 03:03.417
- [sighs]

03:06.625 --> 03:09.750
- FOR ONCE IN YOUR LIFE,
BE REASONABLE!

03:09.750 --> 03:11.625
- I'M TIRED.

03:11.625 --> 03:13.959
SICK AND TIRED OF THE DIRT

03:13.959 --> 03:16.375
AND MILES
THAT SEEM TO LEAD NOWHERE

03:16.375 --> 03:19.250
AND THE LAYERS OF DUST
ON MY SKIN.

03:19.250 --> 03:20.917
ACHING FEET, ACHING BACK.

03:20.917 --> 03:22.792
IF I NEVER SIT IN THAT WAGON
AGAIN,

03:22.792 --> 03:24.583
IT WILL BE ALL RIGHT BY ME.

03:24.583 --> 03:26.291
[horse snorts and whinnies]

03:29.291 --> 03:31.125
- MARTY.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.291
- I SEE.

03:55.917 --> 03:57.000
[giggles]

03:59.458 --> 04:02.041
- IT'S EXACTLY LIKE
I PICTURED IT.

04:04.208 --> 04:06.542
CAN YOU SEE IT?
JUST OVER THERE.

04:06.542 --> 04:07.750
- A CABIN.

04:07.750 --> 04:09.208
WITH CURTAINS IN THE WINDOWS.

04:09.208 --> 04:11.750
- A-A-AND OVER HERE,
A BARN!

04:11.750 --> 04:14.834
- AND A GARDEN, WHERE WE'LL GROW
OUR OWN FOOD.

04:14.834 --> 04:17.875
- THOSE TREES ARE JUST MADE
FOR SWINGS FOR ALL THOSE KIDS

04:17.875 --> 04:19.709
WHO ARE GONNA LOOK
JUST LIKE THEIR MOMMA.

04:19.709 --> 04:23.041
- I DON'T MIND
IF THEY LOOK LIKE THEIR FATHER.

04:23.041 --> 04:25.417
- WE DID IT.
[laughs]

04:25.417 --> 04:27.875
WE ACTUALLY DID IT, MARTY.

04:27.875 --> 04:29.875
THIS JUST FEELS RIGHT,
DOESN'T IT?

04:29.875 --> 04:32.208
THIS WILL BE THE PERFECT PLACE
TO RAISE A FAMILY.

04:32.208 --> 04:33.625
PASS DOWN THE LAND
TO OUR CHILDREN

04:33.625 --> 04:35.750
AND GIVE THEM OPPORTUNITIES
THAT ARE LIMITLESS.

04:37.208 --> 04:39.041
- WE CAN DO ANYTHING,

04:39.041 --> 04:41.125
AS LONG AS WE'RE TOGETHER.

04:52.000 --> 04:56.625
- [laughing]
- OH! [laughing]

04:56.625 --> 04:57.875
- PROMISE ME...

04:57.875 --> 04:59.875
THAT EVEN IF THINGS GET ROUGH,

04:59.875 --> 05:02.792
WE'LL REMIND EACH OTHER OF THAT,
OK?

05:02.792 --> 05:05.250
- I PROMISE.

05:13.750 --> 05:16.792
- DADBLAMEIT!

05:17.834 --> 05:18.917
MARTY.

05:20.709 --> 05:22.333
ONE OF THE HORSES GOT AWAY.

05:22.333 --> 05:23.834
- OH NO, AARON.

05:23.834 --> 05:25.959
- I'M TAKING THE OTHER HORSE,
AND I'M GOING AFTER HIM.

05:25.959 --> 05:27.417
SHOULDN'T BE GONE TOO LONG.

05:27.417 --> 05:29.709
HE'S PROBABLY JUST A WAYS
DOWN THE STREAM.

05:35.417 --> 05:37.250
- I'M COMING WITH YOU.

05:37.250 --> 05:38.583
- NO NEED.

05:38.583 --> 05:41.083
I'LL BE BACK WITH THAT HORSE
BEFORE BREAKFAST.

05:41.083 --> 05:44.250
MAKE UP A LOT OF PANCAKES.
I'LL BE HUNGRY.

06:06.583 --> 06:08.625
[horse whinnies]

06:08.625 --> 06:09.667
GOT YA.

06:09.667 --> 06:11.458
[horse whinnying]

06:11.458 --> 06:13.125
HYA!

06:17.792 --> 06:19.208
COME ON!

06:23.917 --> 06:26.125
HYA, COME ON! LET'S GO!

06:34.333 --> 06:35.417
HYA!

06:36.250 --> 06:38.125
COME ON!

06:38.125 --> 06:39.166
COME ON, LET'S GO!

06:44.834 --> 06:46.250
HYA, HYA!

06:48.792 --> 06:51.667
[horse neighing]
UH!

07:41.667 --> 07:43.291
[softly] MARTY.

08:04.542 --> 08:06.250
[horse whinnies]

08:32.917 --> 08:35.375
- HO! WHOA.

08:40.875 --> 08:44.542
MRS. CLARIDGE, BEN.
BEN GRAHAM, MA'AM?

08:44.542 --> 08:46.208
MET YOU A COUPLE DAYS BACK.

08:53.041 --> 08:55.709
FOUND HIM ABOUT AN HOUR AGO.

09:13.792 --> 09:17.166
- [Marty breathes shakily]

09:41.500 --> 09:43.083
- MRS. CLARIDGE.

09:43.083 --> 09:45.083
CAN I GET YOU SOME WATER?

09:45.083 --> 09:46.208
MA'AM!

09:51.000 --> 09:53.834
[stifled crying]

09:53.834 --> 09:55.917
MRS. CLARIDGE?

09:59.166 --> 10:02.166
I GUESS YOU'LL BE NEEDING
TIME TO...

10:02.166 --> 10:03.709
TO THINK, UH...

10:03.709 --> 10:06.542
MY WIFE WILL SEE
TO YOUR HUSBAND.

10:06.542 --> 10:09.875
THE PREACHER'S LEAVING TOMORROW.

10:09.875 --> 10:12.083
I CAN BRING HIM BACK HERE
FIRST THING IN THE MORNING,

10:12.083 --> 10:14.709
SAY A FEW WORDS.

10:19.542 --> 10:21.083
OH.

10:24.041 --> 10:28.500
[wind blowing]

10:29.667 --> 10:32.291
- WE'RE FINE.

10:32.291 --> 10:38.458
WE'RE FINE.
WE'RE FINE.

10:38.458 --> 10:42.125
WE'RE FINE. WE'RE FINE.

10:42.125 --> 10:44.917
[howling]

10:47.375 --> 10:49.417
WE'RE FINE.

10:52.834 --> 10:55.250
- [clearing throat] HELLO?

10:56.750 --> 10:58.291
MRS. CLARIDGE?

11:00.208 --> 11:01.709
MARTY?

11:02.500 --> 11:03.917
IT'S ME...

11:03.917 --> 11:06.417
SARAH GRAHAM, BEN'S WIFE.

11:06.417 --> 11:09.375
YOU MET ME A COUPLE DAYS AGO.

11:09.375 --> 11:12.000
[people talking indistinctly]

11:15.208 --> 11:16.417
MARTY.

11:18.083 --> 11:20.583
IT'S TIME.

11:20.583 --> 11:24.417
WE NEED TO START
YOUR HUSBAND'S FUNERAL.

11:24.417 --> 11:27.083
WE DON'T WANT TO BE STARTING IT
WITHOUT YA.

11:43.458 --> 11:45.625
- [whimpers]

11:54.709 --> 11:57.041
I CAN'T DO THIS.

12:02.208 --> 12:04.041
- YOU HAVE TO DO THIS.

12:07.959 --> 12:10.125
- I WOULD--

12:10.125 --> 12:14.667
I WOULD APPRECIATE JUST--
JUST A MOMENT, PLEASE.

12:16.125 --> 12:18.333
- WE'LL WAIT.

12:30.166 --> 12:33.500
- [whimpers]

12:48.500 --> 12:50.875
- AARON CLARIDGE

12:50.875 --> 12:54.542
JOURNEYED WEST
IN SEARCH OF A DREAM.

12:54.542 --> 12:58.500
HIS UNTIMELY DEATH MEANS
THAT ONE JOURNEY IS OVER

12:58.500 --> 13:01.083
AND ANOTHER HAS JUST BEGUN.

13:04.208 --> 13:09.709
[low chatter]

13:09.709 --> 13:12.000
- [sighs]

13:18.375 --> 13:19.875
- WINTER'S COMING,

13:19.875 --> 13:22.375
AND THERE'S NO WAGON TRAIN
HEADING EAST 'TIL SPRING.

13:23.917 --> 13:26.834
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU'RE FIXED
FOR MONEY TO BOARD IN TOWN,

13:26.834 --> 13:28.458
BUT...

13:28.458 --> 13:32.041
[sighs] YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
MAKE A DECISION, AND SOON.

13:34.792 --> 13:37.750
[sighs] WELL...

13:37.750 --> 13:39.291
YOU TAKE TONIGHT
AND THINK ON IT,

13:39.291 --> 13:42.917
AND BEN WILL COME CHECK ON YOU
TOMORROW.

13:44.250 --> 13:46.083
- THANK YOU.

14:06.417 --> 14:10.750
[thunder rumbling]

14:28.000 --> 14:29.542
- EXCUSE ME, MA'AM.

14:31.750 --> 14:34.166
I'M CLARK DAVIS...

14:34.166 --> 14:36.208
AND I'M TRULY SORRY
ABOUT YOUR LOSS.

14:40.333 --> 14:42.417
I HAVE A PROPOSITION FOR YOU.

14:50.250 --> 14:52.792
I KNOW IT'S NOT THE RIGHT PLACE
OR THE RIGHT TIME.

14:55.959 --> 14:58.250
BUT I FIGURE IF WE MARRY,

14:58.250 --> 15:00.291
IT'LL HELP SOLVE
BOTH OUR PROBLEMS.

15:00.291 --> 15:03.583
YOU'LL HAVE A ROOF
OVER YOUR HEAD,

15:03.583 --> 15:05.166
AND ALL YOUR NEEDS WILL BE MET.

15:05.166 --> 15:08.333
AND MY MISSIE?
WELL, SHE'LL HAVE A MAMA.

15:08.333 --> 15:11.250
I KNOW IT SOUNDS-- CRAZY.

15:12.500 --> 15:15.834
AND THE TIMING'S UNLIKELY.

15:15.834 --> 15:17.166
BUT YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND,

15:17.166 --> 15:18.959
THE PREACHER'S LEAVING THE AREA
TODAY,

15:18.959 --> 15:21.166
AND HE'S NOT GONNA BE BACK
UNTIL SPRING.

15:22.458 --> 15:24.125
AND I ASK THIS...

15:24.125 --> 15:26.041
ONLY FOR MY DAUGHTER.

15:27.208 --> 15:30.166
I'M THINKING...

15:30.166 --> 15:33.166
THAT SHE NEEDS A WOMAN'S HAND...

15:33.166 --> 15:35.709
IN PARTS OF HER LIFE.

15:35.709 --> 15:38.875
I KNOW IT'S NOT
THE PERFECT SOLUTION,

15:38.875 --> 15:42.750
BUT WHEN THE WAGON TRAIN
HEADS BACK EAST IN THE SPRING...

15:45.291 --> 15:47.709
I'LL PAY THE PASSAGE
SO YOU CAN GO HOME.

15:51.208 --> 15:52.917
- YOU'LL HELP ME GET HOME?

15:52.917 --> 15:55.000
- IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT.

15:58.667 --> 16:01.041
I'LL LEAVE YOU TO THINK ON IT,
MA'AM.

16:25.208 --> 16:27.667
[kids yelling]

16:29.208 --> 16:31.583
[men talking indistinctly]

16:31.583 --> 16:32.917
- COME ON, GET UP!
- HEY!

16:32.917 --> 16:36.875
- PA, I TRIED TO STOP THEM.
- HEY, HEY!

16:36.875 --> 16:38.083
MISSIE!

16:38.083 --> 16:39.583
HEY! HEY, COME HERE!

16:39.583 --> 16:43.250
- [panting]
HE STARTED IT, PA.

16:43.250 --> 16:44.792
- COME HERE, YOU GET UP.
GET UP!

16:44.792 --> 16:46.917
- CLINT SAYS I GOT A NEW MA.

16:46.917 --> 16:48.458
HE'S LYIN' TO ME.

16:48.458 --> 16:50.959
- IS THAT TRUE, CLINT?
- NO, SIR.

16:50.959 --> 16:53.667
SHE POKED ME RIGHT IN THE NOSE
FOR NO GOOD REASON.

16:53.667 --> 16:55.959
- YOU'RE A LIAR!
THAT IS SO A GOOD REASON.

16:55.959 --> 16:58.000
- HEY! WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GOING?

16:58.000 --> 17:00.083
- UH!

17:00.083 --> 17:02.250
- APOLOGIZE.

17:04.458 --> 17:06.333
- SORRY.

17:09.583 --> 17:12.165
- SORRY.

17:12.165 --> 17:14.959
- WHAT DID I TELL YOU
ABOUT FIGHTING WITH GIRLS?

17:14.959 --> 17:16.875
- I AIN'T FIGHTIN' WITH NO GIRL.

17:16.875 --> 17:18.290
IT'S JUST MISSIE.

17:18.290 --> 17:20.458
- [sighs] GET INSIDE. GO ON.

17:21.709 --> 17:23.125
NO WORRIES.

17:23.125 --> 17:24.750
- COME ON, MISSIE.

17:25.500 --> 17:26.959
WE NEED TO TALK.

17:29.834 --> 17:32.250
WHAT ARE YOU UPSET ABOUT?

17:32.250 --> 17:33.625
YOU ALL RIGHT? HUH?

17:33.625 --> 17:36.375
- I DON'T WANT TO DO THIS.

17:36.375 --> 17:38.208
I JUST WANT TO GO HOME.

17:38.208 --> 17:40.667
- NOW, YOU LISTEN TO ME.

17:40.667 --> 17:43.291
THERE'S NO PLACE
IN THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY

17:43.291 --> 17:46.125
TO WASTE YOUR TIME
CRYIN' OVER WANTS.

17:47.166 --> 17:49.500
YOUR LIFE'S ABOUT NEEDS NOW.

17:49.500 --> 17:53.792
YOU NEED A ROOF OVER YOUR HEAD
FOR THE WINTER.

17:53.792 --> 17:56.834
NOW, THAT'S
WHAT YOU BARGAINED FOR.

17:56.834 --> 17:59.750
- WE ARE HERE TODAY,
GATHERED IN THE LORD'S NAME,

17:59.750 --> 18:02.250
TO JOIN THIS MAN AND THIS WOMAN
IN MARRIAGE.

18:03.500 --> 18:04.583
PLEASE JOIN HANDS.

18:10.500 --> 18:12.667
WILL YOU, CLARK DAVIS,

18:12.667 --> 18:15.500
TAKE MARTY CLARIDGE TO BE
YOUR LAWFUL WEDDED WIFE?

18:15.500 --> 18:17.458
- I WILL.

18:17.458 --> 18:20.583
- [whimpering]

18:20.583 --> 18:22.542
- AND WILL YOU, MARTY CLARIDGE,

18:22.542 --> 18:26.375
TAKE CLARK DAVIS TO BE
YOUR HUSBAND?

18:30.083 --> 18:32.041
- COME ON, NOW, LET'S GO.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.750
- JUST ANSWER "I WILL."

18:36.750 --> 18:39.417
- I WILL.

18:39.417 --> 18:43.041
- THEN I PRONOUNCE YOU
MAN AND WIFE.

19:03.750 --> 19:05.583
- [dog barking]

19:05.583 --> 19:07.875
- BUDDY. COME HERE, BUDDY.

19:07.875 --> 19:11.083

19:11.083 --> 19:13.166
[chicken clucking]

19:24.542 --> 19:25.917
[clears throat]

19:25.917 --> 19:28.542
THIS IS THE BEDROOM
YOU AND MISSIE WILL BE SHARING.

19:28.542 --> 19:30.750
I'LL GET MY THINGS
MOVED INTO THE LEAN-TO.

20:14.333 --> 20:17.125
[crickets chirping]

20:20.625 --> 20:23.625
[owl hooting]

21:02.500 --> 21:04.125
- MORNING.
[clears throat]

21:05.750 --> 21:07.417
SAVED YOU SOME HAM.

21:07.417 --> 21:12.166
I'M--I'M NOT MUCH OF A COOK,
BUT IT'S USUALLY PRETTY FILLING.

21:14.333 --> 21:17.208
- I'VE NEVER SEEN NOBODY
SLEEP SO LONG.

21:17.208 --> 21:19.125
I THOUGHT SHE MIGHT BE DEAD.

21:19.125 --> 21:20.625
- MISSIE...

21:20.625 --> 21:23.500
GO AND WAIT FOR ME
IN THE WAGON.

21:27.041 --> 21:29.917
[sighs]

21:29.917 --> 21:32.166
GOT SOME THINGS
I NEED TO TEND TO.

21:32.166 --> 21:34.583
I'LL BE TAKING MISSIE WITH ME.

21:34.583 --> 21:37.834
[clears throat]

21:37.834 --> 21:39.542
I WON'T BE BACK 'TIL SUPPER.

21:42.041 --> 21:44.875
BYE.

21:49.417 --> 21:52.625
HYA! HYA!

22:40.542 --> 22:46.125
- [crying]

23:08.625 --> 23:13.500
[crying]

23:23.041 --> 23:24.667
[door squeaks]

23:24.667 --> 23:26.750
[footsteps]

23:26.750 --> 23:30.208
- SHE'S SLEEPING AGAIN.

23:30.208 --> 23:32.291
- MM-HMM.

23:32.291 --> 23:33.875
LET'S GO HAVE OUR SUPPER.

23:33.875 --> 23:36.000
- PA...

23:36.000 --> 23:37.458
IS SHE ALL RIGHT?

23:37.458 --> 23:40.417
- NO.

23:40.417 --> 23:42.333
BUT SHE WILL BE.

23:45.500 --> 23:46.667
COME ON.

23:51.834 --> 23:56.041
- [sighs]

23:56.041 --> 23:57.750
[horse whinnying]
- [gasps]

24:04.959 --> 24:09.083
[horse neighs]

24:10.250 --> 24:12.375
- COME ON!

24:12.375 --> 24:15.041
COME ON! COME ON!

24:15.041 --> 24:18.041
COME ON!

24:26.166 --> 24:28.250
AND BLESS THIS DEAR CHILD

24:28.250 --> 24:29.959
IN HER TIME OF GRIEF.

24:29.959 --> 24:31.709
AND BLESS THIS FOOD BEFORE US,

24:31.709 --> 24:35.333
AND WE THANK YOU FOR
THE FINE DAY AHEAD OF US, AMEN.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.583
- YOU GOT AN AWFUL LOT
OF PRETTY DRESSES.

24:52.417 --> 24:55.500
SEEMS LIKE YOU GOT
AN AWFUL LOT OF FANCY THINGS

24:55.500 --> 24:56.875
THAT AREN'T GOOD FOR
MUCH ANYTHING AT ALL.

24:56.875 --> 24:58.542
- WE FETCHED YOUR WAGON
FOR YOU YESTERDAY,

24:58.542 --> 25:01.542
AND WE BROUGHT IT INTO THE BARN.

25:01.542 --> 25:05.083
- WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO
WITH ALL THEM BOOKS?

25:11.959 --> 25:15.041
- I CHECKED TO SEE IF THERE WAS
ANY FOOD THAT WOULD SPOIL

25:15.041 --> 25:16.750
WHEN I WAS STACKING UP
YOUR THINGS.

25:16.750 --> 25:20.125
- WE PLANNED ON BUYING SUPPLIES
AS SOON AS WE FOUND OUR LAND.

25:20.125 --> 25:22.709
- THE BOOKS MUST BE
PRETTY IMPORTANT TO YOU.

25:22.709 --> 25:25.875
I'LL SEE IF WE CAN FIND
SPACE FOR THEM IN THE CABIN.

25:27.959 --> 25:31.125
- [sighs] I'M NOT SURE
WHAT YOU'RE EXPECTING FROM ME.

25:32.834 --> 25:34.083
- COME WITH ME.

25:36.125 --> 25:38.291
[cow mooing]

25:38.291 --> 25:40.500
MISSIE'S 9 YEARS OLD.

25:40.500 --> 25:44.208
SHE WORKS ALMOST AS HARD
AS I DO, SUN UP TO SUN DOWN.

25:44.208 --> 25:47.792
HAS BEEN
FOR THE LAST COUPLE YEARS.

25:47.792 --> 25:49.041
SHE NEVER COMPLAINS.

25:49.041 --> 25:52.917
BUT THE WORK IS STEALING
HER CHILDHOOD.

25:52.917 --> 25:56.000
SHE DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT SHE'S MISSING.

25:57.750 --> 25:59.166
BUT I DO.

26:01.291 --> 26:04.375
MAYBE IF SOMEBODY'S THERE
TO SHARE THE CHORES,

26:04.375 --> 26:07.542
SHE'D HAVE TIME TO LEARN

26:07.542 --> 26:11.166
SOME OF THE THINGS
I THINK YOU COULD TEACH HER...

26:12.834 --> 26:15.500
THINGS SHE'D LEARN
FROM HER MOTHER.

26:15.500 --> 26:18.792
- AND WHEN I GO HOME
IN THE SPRING?

26:18.792 --> 26:21.834
- [sighs]

26:21.834 --> 26:24.667
I FIGURE I'LL CROSS THAT BRIDGE
WHEN I COME TO IT.

26:27.542 --> 26:29.834
- THE BOOKS.

26:29.834 --> 26:33.625
HOW DID YOU KNOW THEY WERE MINE
AND NOT AARON'S?

26:33.625 --> 26:36.041
- OH, WELL, A MAN WOULD HAVE
THROWN THEM OFF THE WAGON

26:36.041 --> 26:37.959
AT THE FIRST BIG HILL

26:37.959 --> 26:42.000
UNLESS HE WAS TRYING TO PLEASE
A STUBBORN WOMAN.

26:46.417 --> 26:49.834
[chicken clucking]

26:53.125 --> 26:54.333
- WHY ARE YOU HERE?

26:54.333 --> 26:56.834
- [sighs]

26:56.834 --> 26:58.875
I THOUGHT YOU COULD USE
SOME HELP.

26:58.875 --> 27:00.750
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO DO?

27:00.750 --> 27:03.375
- YOU MAY NEED A PLACE TO STAY,
BUT I DON'T NEED A MOTHER.

27:03.375 --> 27:04.875
PA AND ME BEEN DOING JUST FINE.

27:08.375 --> 27:12.208
- I'M A LITTLE UNSURE
ABOUT WHAT TO DO.

27:12.208 --> 27:13.709
WHY DON'T YOU SHOW ME

27:13.709 --> 27:16.834
HOW TO GET THOSE EGGS OUT
FROM UNDERNEATH THEIR...

27:16.834 --> 27:18.375
YOU KNOW.

27:18.375 --> 27:20.291
- THEIR REARS?

27:22.417 --> 27:23.792
[sighs]

27:27.917 --> 27:29.542
- SPELL "COW."

27:29.542 --> 27:32.583
- K-A...

27:32.583 --> 27:34.875
- CLOSE. IT'S C-O-W.

27:34.875 --> 27:37.667
- GERTIE DON'T CARE IF I KNOW
HOW TO SPELL "COW" OR NOT.

27:37.667 --> 27:40.417
- GERTIE DOESN'T CARE,
BUT I DO.

27:40.417 --> 27:41.959
AND SO DOES YOUR PA.

27:41.959 --> 27:44.083
SO, LET'S TRY ANOTHER ONE.

27:44.083 --> 27:46.291
SPELL "FUN."

27:46.291 --> 27:48.375
- F...

27:48.375 --> 27:49.959
[cow moos]

27:49.959 --> 27:51.750
[sighs]

27:51.750 --> 27:53.458
HOW DO YOU SPELL "WARM"?

27:53.458 --> 27:55.583
- WARM? W-A-R-M.

27:55.583 --> 27:58.375
- I THINK YOU BETTER
W-A-R-M YOUR HANDS.

27:58.375 --> 27:59.375
- WHAT?

27:59.375 --> 28:00.834
- WELL, HOW DO YOU EXPECT GERTIE

28:00.834 --> 28:02.083
TO GIVE YOU GOOD MILK

28:02.083 --> 28:03.709
WHEN YOU'RE FREEZING HER
LIKE THAT?

28:03.709 --> 28:08.750
CAN PROBABLY SPELL "MILKING,"
BUT YOU SURE CAN'T DO IT.

28:18.083 --> 28:19.375
HOW'D YOU GET TO BE SO OLD

28:19.375 --> 28:21.667
WITHOUT NOT KNOWING
HOW TO DO NOTHIN'?

28:28.542 --> 28:32.250
- [breathing heavily]

28:48.625 --> 28:50.959
[Marty straining]

28:58.375 --> 29:00.417
[gasps]

29:00.417 --> 29:02.750
[grunts]

29:04.000 --> 29:06.834
- OOPS! I REALLY DIDN'T MEAN TO.

29:06.834 --> 29:08.792
- I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE
MEANING TO DO, MISSIE!

29:08.792 --> 29:11.166
NOW, YOU LISTEN TO ME!

29:11.166 --> 29:14.125
- YOU'RE NOT MY MOTHER, AND I
DON'T HAVE TO LISTEN TO YOU!

29:14.125 --> 29:15.959
- AS LONG AS I AM HERE--
- I DON'T WANT YOU HERE!

29:15.959 --> 29:18.792
- I'VE GOT NEWS FOR YOU!
I DON'T WANT TO BE HERE EITHER.

29:18.792 --> 29:20.375
BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS

29:20.375 --> 29:22.000
I MADE A BARGAIN
WITH YOUR FATHER,

29:22.000 --> 29:24.166
AND I INTEND TO KEEP
MY END OF THAT BARGAIN,

29:24.166 --> 29:25.834
EVEN IF YOU DO EVERYTHING
SHORT OF TRYING

29:25.834 --> 29:28.291
TO KILL ME IN THE PROCESS.

29:28.291 --> 29:30.291
SO, THE WAY I SEE IT,

29:30.291 --> 29:33.625
IF I CAN SURVIVE TRAVELING
FOR MONTHS IN A COVERED WAGON,

29:33.625 --> 29:36.709
LOSING MY HUSBAND,
MARRYING A COMPLETE STRANGER,

29:36.709 --> 29:39.709
I CAN SURVIVE YOU.

29:43.709 --> 29:45.291
- SO, HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

29:45.291 --> 29:47.542
- FINE.
- YEAH, FINE.

29:49.333 --> 29:51.083
- [clears throat]

29:51.083 --> 29:54.417
I RAN INTO BEN AND SARAH GRAHAM
IN TOWN TODAY,

29:54.417 --> 29:55.875
AND THEY WERE ASKING AFTER YOU.

29:55.875 --> 29:57.875
- THAT WAS KIND OF THEM.

29:57.875 --> 30:01.291
- ACTUALLY, THEY INVITED US ALL
TO THEIR ANNUAL GET-TOGETHER.

30:01.291 --> 30:02.583
- IS IT ALREADY TIME?

30:02.583 --> 30:04.166
- IT IS.

30:04.166 --> 30:08.000
YOU SEE, THE GRAHAMS
HAVE A PARTY THIS TIME OF YEAR

30:08.000 --> 30:10.709
SO FOLKS CAN GET TOGETHER

30:10.709 --> 30:13.333
BEFORE THEY'RE STUCK INSIDE
FOR THE WINTER.

30:15.166 --> 30:19.083
WE'D UNDERSTAND IT IF, YOU KNOW,
YOU WEREN'T UP FOR A PARTY.

30:19.083 --> 30:21.375
BUT IT'S UP TO YOU.

30:21.375 --> 30:23.125
- YEAH. YOU PROBABLY
WOULDN'T LIKE IT.

30:23.125 --> 30:25.041
THERE'S TONS OF PEOPLE
YOU WON'T KNOW.

30:25.041 --> 30:27.083
YOU'D PROBABLY JUST LIKE
STAYING HOME BETTER.

30:27.083 --> 30:28.875
DON'T YOU THINK, PA?

30:28.875 --> 30:31.458
- I THINK I WILL GO.

30:31.458 --> 30:33.000
- GOOD.

30:38.792 --> 30:40.709
[knocking]

30:43.083 --> 30:44.083
- WHAT IS IT?

30:44.083 --> 30:45.917
- I JUST NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

30:47.208 --> 30:49.083
- MISSIE'S ASLEEP,
AND I'M READY FOR BED.

30:49.083 --> 30:50.208
CAN'T WE TALK TOMORROW?

30:50.208 --> 30:51.583
- WELL, THAT'S JUST IT.

30:51.583 --> 30:53.709
I WON'T BE HERE TOMORROW.

30:53.709 --> 30:56.500
I'M-- I'M LEAVING BEFORE SUN-UP.

30:56.500 --> 30:57.750
GOING TO HELP OUR NEIGHBOR.

30:57.750 --> 30:59.291
- FINE.

30:59.291 --> 31:01.208
- WAIT, IT'S--

31:01.208 --> 31:03.083
- WHAT ELSE?

31:04.417 --> 31:06.792
- I'LL BE LEAVING MISSIE
HERE WITH YOU.

31:06.792 --> 31:08.792
- THAT IS WHY I'M HERE.

31:08.792 --> 31:11.083
- YEAH, I, YOU KNOW,

31:11.083 --> 31:12.834
I JUST WASN'T SURE
IF YOU WERE UP TO DEALING

31:12.834 --> 31:14.125
WITH A SPIRITED--

31:14.125 --> 31:16.208
- I'M FINE.
SOMETHING ELSE?

31:16.208 --> 31:18.625
- NO-- YEAH.

31:18.625 --> 31:20.125
I'LL BE BACK BY SUPPER.

31:20.125 --> 31:21.458
- FINE. GOODNIGHT.

31:21.458 --> 31:23.625
- GOOD-- NIGHT.

31:31.041 --> 31:33.625

31:49.500 --> 31:52.125

31:52.125 --> 31:56.166
[sighs]

31:59.166 --> 32:00.583
MISSIE!

32:02.625 --> 32:04.500
- YOU BETTER GET OUT OF HERE.

32:04.500 --> 32:06.250
- [sighs]

32:06.250 --> 32:08.667
WHY DON'T YOU COME DOWN
SO WE CAN GET TO WORK.

32:08.667 --> 32:11.166
- OK.

32:11.166 --> 32:13.333
JUST AS SOON AS HE LEAVES.

32:13.333 --> 32:14.583

JUST COME DOWN SLOWLY.

32:24.667 --> 32:28.041
I'VE READ THAT THEY WON'T SPRAY
UNLESS THEY FEEL THREATENED.

32:28.041 --> 32:30.041
- YOU READ THAT
IN ONE OF YOUR BOOKS?

32:30.041 --> 32:32.250
- UH-HUH.

32:32.250 --> 32:33.875
- AND YOU BELIEVE IT?

32:33.875 --> 32:36.000
- I DO.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.750
- WELL, NOT ME.

32:38.750 --> 32:42.542
I'M STARVING, AND I GOTTA USE

33:06.917 --> 33:10.166
UGH!

33:10.166 --> 33:13.792
ARE YOU SURE THIS IS GOING
TO TAKE THE SMELL AWAY?

33:13.792 --> 33:15.375
- MORE OR LESS.

33:15.375 --> 33:17.250
SOME OF IT'S JUST GOING TO
HAVE TO WEAR OFF.

33:17.250 --> 33:20.041
- MMM. MMM.

33:23.250 --> 33:26.417

I COULD BURN MYSELF.

33:31.750 --> 33:33.375
- [sighs]

33:37.542 --> 33:39.834
- SOMETHING'S BURNING.

33:42.333 --> 33:43.667

33:56.083 --> 33:57.208

SOME OF THE STING OUT.

34:13.000 --> 34:14.375

34:21.458 --> 34:24.125
IT JUST TAKES
A LITTLE PRACTICE, THAT'S ALL.

34:25.667 --> 34:27.667
[clears throat]

34:27.667 --> 34:29.500
SO, WHERE'D THE SKUNK FIND YOU?

34:32.083 --> 34:33.458

34:44.958 --> 34:47.833
MISSIE, WHY DON'T YOU GO AHEAD
AND STOKE THAT FIRE.

34:57.166 --> 34:59.667
I'LL TRY TO GET ALL THE THINGS
ON YOUR LIST FOR YOU

34:59.667 --> 35:02.000
WHILE I'M IN TOWN.

35:02.000 --> 35:03.917
YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT
TO GO WITH US?

35:03.917 --> 35:06.458

35:06.458 --> 35:09.917
SHE SAID SHE DON'T.

35:09.917 --> 35:11.375
- DOESN'T.

35:13.166 --> 35:16.959
- HOPE YOU CAN MAKE SOMETHING
BETTER THAN BURNT PANCAKES.

35:16.959 --> 35:18.291
TOO BAD I'LL BE GONE,

SOME REAL GOOD FRIED CHICKEN.

35:22.166 --> 35:23.834

37:34.208 --> 37:37.291
- SURE WON'T WANT TO
HAVE TO WASH ALL THAT.

37:37.291 --> 37:39.500
- I LEFT HALF MY THINGS AT HOME.

37:39.500 --> 37:41.375
- IT'S KIND OF WASTEFUL,
DON'T YOU THINK?

37:41.375 --> 37:42.875

ONE DRESS AT A TIME.

37:45.792 --> 37:49.333

SOME DRESSES OF YOUR OWN.

37:49.333 --> 37:51.291
- ONE FOR WHEN THE REVEREND
PASSES THIS WAY

37:51.291 --> 37:53.000
AND HOLDS A SERVICE.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.667

YOU CAN ONLY WEAR ONE DRESS--

37:55.667 --> 37:58.208

38:00.875 --> 38:03.792

38:03.792 --> 38:07.792

THIS HERE PATTERN TO SHAME.

38:07.792 --> 38:10.125

FOR ALL THE NEIGHBORS

38:10.125 --> 38:11.625
WHEN THEY HAD THEIR BABIES.

38:11.625 --> 38:14.208
- I'M SURE
THEY APPRECIATED THAT.

38:16.583 --> 38:18.208
ESPECIALLY MY PA.

38:20.291 --> 38:24.250
THAT'S WHY HIS EYES AIN'T
SPARKLY LIKE THEY USED TO BE.

38:25.917 --> 38:28.208

38:28.208 --> 38:31.959

YOU EVER SAW.

38:31.959 --> 38:33.959

40:07.125 --> 40:10.166
IT'S HIS TIME TO BE ALONE
AND TALK TO THE LORD.

40:10.166 --> 40:12.542

TALK TO HIM ABOUT THIS MORNING.

40:12.542 --> 40:13.667

40:13.667 --> 40:14.667

40:14.667 --> 40:16.000
A LITTLE WALK OF MY OWN.

40:16.000 --> 40:17.333
YOU ALL RIGHT HERE BY YOURSELF?

41:09.583 --> 41:10.792
- I PICKED THIS DRESS

41:10.792 --> 41:14.208
BECAUSE I KNOW PINK IS
YOUR FAVORITE COLOR.

41:15.959 --> 41:19.125
I LOVE IT WHEN YOU WEAR PINK,
MAMA.

41:19.125 --> 41:21.041
YOU ALWAYS LOOK SO PRETTY.

41:28.125 --> 41:32.625

WILL MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER.

41:38.750 --> 41:41.709
[sighs]

41:41.709 --> 41:47.792
I-- I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY DIDN'T
LET ME COME HERE, MAMA,

41:47.792 --> 41:51.083
BECAUSE I WOULD HAVE SAT HERE
JUST LIKE THIS.

41:53.250 --> 42:00.291
AND I WOULDN'T HAVE MADE YOU
TIRED OR SAD.

42:00.291 --> 42:05.625
I JUST WANTED TO TELL YOU
THAT I LOVED YOU.

42:08.458 --> 42:10.750
AND I MISS YOU.

42:10.750 --> 42:12.458

42:18.875 --> 42:22.125
- YOU WERE SPYING ON ME!

42:22.125 --> 42:23.583
- NO.

42:23.583 --> 42:25.792
- YOU'RE LYING, I SAW YOU.

42:25.792 --> 42:28.291
YOU WERE WATCHING.
HOW COULD YOU DO THAT?

42:28.291 --> 42:32.417
- MISSIE, I DIDN'T MEAN
TO BE THERE.

42:32.417 --> 42:34.500
BUT I DO KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE FEELING.

42:34.500 --> 42:37.458
- DON'T SAY THAT!
YOU DON'T KNOW NOTHIN'!

42:37.458 --> 42:39.583

42:39.583 --> 42:41.458

42:41.458 --> 42:43.875
I HATE IT THAT YOU'RE HERE.

42:43.875 --> 42:46.041
I WAS FINE BEFORE YOU CAME.

42:46.041 --> 42:50.834
I WISH IT WAS SPRING
SO YOU WOULD LEAVE.

43:15.333 --> 43:17.792
- I DIDN'T MEAN TO. I--

43:17.792 --> 43:19.125
I WAS COLD. I--

43:19.125 --> 43:21.333
I DIDN'T MEAN TO WALK IN ON HER
LIKE THAT.

43:21.333 --> 43:24.917
- I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.
I MEAN, ABOUT LAST NIGHT, I...

43:24.917 --> 43:26.542
I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO WALK--

43:26.542 --> 43:28.500
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I WAS THINKING.

43:28.500 --> 43:29.583
I CAN'T STAY HERE.

43:29.583 --> 43:31.917
- WHY?
- WHY?

43:31.917 --> 43:33.667
THAT LITTLE GIRL HATES ME.

43:33.667 --> 43:36.041
YOU WERE RIGHT.

43:36.041 --> 43:37.709
SHE DOES NEED A MOTHER,

43:37.709 --> 43:40.291
BUT I'M NOT THE RIGHT PERSON.

43:40.291 --> 43:43.375
SHE DOESN'T KNOW IT,
BUT SHE'S STILL GRIEVING.

43:43.375 --> 43:45.000
- THAT'S WHY YOU'RE
THE RIGHT PERSON.

43:45.000 --> 43:47.333
- IT'S JUST NOT GOING WELL.

43:47.333 --> 43:49.250
- IT'S GOING JUST THE WAY
I THOUGHT IT WOULD.

43:49.250 --> 43:50.959
I MEAN, I KNEW
SHE WOULDN'T LIKE IT AT FIRST.

43:50.959 --> 43:53.041
- THEN WHY PUT HER THROUGH THIS?

43:53.041 --> 43:54.834
- BECAUSE I LOVE HER.

43:54.834 --> 43:57.208
AND SHE NEEDS MORE
THAN I CAN GIVE HER.

43:57.208 --> 43:59.750
- SEEMS LIKE AN AWFUL LOT
OF TROUBLE TO GO THROUGH

43:59.750 --> 44:03.041
FOR JUST A FEW MONTHS OF LESSONS
AND LETTERS AND SEWING.

44:03.041 --> 44:04.500
- NOTHING'S A WASTE OF TIME

44:04.500 --> 44:06.375
THAT ADDS TO THE PERSON
THAT YOU ARE.

44:06.375 --> 44:09.500
AND I'M COUNTING ON THE FACT
THAT KNOWING YOU IS GOING TO ADD

44:09.500 --> 44:12.583
TO THE PERSON
THAT MISSIE WILL BECOME.

44:12.583 --> 44:16.083
I KNOW YOU CAN FIND A WAY
TO GET THROUGH TO HER.

44:17.583 --> 44:19.417
- HOW DO YOU KNOW?

44:19.417 --> 44:21.583
- BECAUSE THAT'S
WHAT I PRAYED FOR.

44:27.208 --> 44:30.166
- [sighs]

44:36.625 --> 44:39.083

47:58.166 --> 48:00.417

48:00.417 --> 48:04.417

WAS EXPECTING MISSIE,

48:04.417 --> 48:07.792
SHE'D HOLD ONTO HER BELLY,
LIKE YOU JUST DID.

48:07.792 --> 48:09.667

48:12.041 --> 48:13.792

48:13.792 --> 48:15.500
THE BABY WON'T BE A PROBLEM,

48:15.500 --> 48:17.000
AND I'M SURE
IT WON'T CHANGE THE FARE

48:17.000 --> 48:19.291
FOR WHEN I GO HOME
IN THE SPRING.

48:21.083 --> 48:24.208

I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU.

48:25.750 --> 48:27.250

I'M GLAD

48:27.250 --> 48:29.667
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
A LITTLE ONE.

49:03.750 --> 49:06.000

ADVENTURES.

56:12.166 --> 56:15.125
[birds tweeting]

56:19.959 --> 56:23.583
- HE SHOULD NEVER HAVE GONE
AFTER THAT HORSE.

56:28.250 --> 56:30.083
IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT.

56:46.250 --> 56:48.291
[turkey gobbling]

56:56.083 --> 56:58.083
- THANK YOU, FATHER,
FOR THIS FOOD

56:58.083 --> 57:00.417
AND THIS SHELTER
AND THIS COMPANIONSHIP.

57:00.417 --> 57:03.458
AND AS WE COME INTO THE SEASON
OF THE BIRTH OF YOUR SON,

57:03.458 --> 57:08.750
PLEASE MAKE OUR HEARTS
THANKFUL THAT HE CAME, AMEN.

57:08.750 --> 57:10.208
- [sighs]

57:10.208 --> 57:12.333
I LOVE CHRISTMAS.

57:12.333 --> 57:14.166
AND I ALREADY KNOW
WHAT I'M GOING TO MAKE YOU, PA.

57:14.166 --> 57:16.083
- IS IT SOMETHING I CAN WEAR?

57:16.083 --> 57:18.417
- [sighs]
HE'S ALWAYS TRYING TO TRICK ME

57:18.417 --> 57:19.667
INTO TELLING HIM.

57:19.667 --> 57:21.041
BUT I'M SMARTER THAN THAT.

57:21.041 --> 57:23.542
- YES.

57:23.542 --> 57:25.834
- SO WHAT DO YOU DO TO GET READY
FOR CHRISTMAS AT YOUR HOUSE?

57:25.834 --> 57:29.333
- WELL, ABOUT A WEEK
BEFORE CHRISTMAS,

57:29.333 --> 57:31.792
WE GO TO FRANKLIN'S
AND PICK OUT A NICE PINE TREE.

57:31.792 --> 57:34.208
- THERE'S PINE TREES
GROWING IN THE CITY?

57:34.208 --> 57:37.375
- NO. IT'S A TREE LOT.

57:37.375 --> 57:38.875
SOMEONE HAS ALREADY
CUT THEM DOWN.

57:38.875 --> 57:41.709
- YOU DON'T GET TO PICK
YOUR OWN TREE

57:41.709 --> 57:43.875
AND SEE WHICH ONE
SMELLS THE BEST,

57:43.875 --> 57:45.625
WHICH ONE LOOKS
THE PRETTIEST IN THE SNOW?

57:45.625 --> 57:47.208
- NOT EXACTLY.

57:47.208 --> 57:48.667
BUT WE FIND ONE WE LIKE,

57:48.667 --> 57:51.208
THEN SOMEONE DELIVERS IT TO US.

57:51.208 --> 57:53.208
THEN WE ADD TO
OUR ORNAMENT COLLECTION

57:53.208 --> 57:55.041
BY GOING TO PURCELL'S STORE.

57:55.041 --> 57:57.041
THEY HAVE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
GLASS BALLS

57:57.041 --> 57:59.709
AND RED RIBBONS
TO PUT ON THE TREE.

57:59.709 --> 58:02.125
WE MAKE HOT COCOA,
DRINK IT BY THE FIRE.

58:02.125 --> 58:04.583
- AND THEN YOUR PA
READS YOU A CHRISTMAS STORY?

58:04.583 --> 58:07.625
- UM, NO.
- WHY NOT?

58:07.625 --> 58:11.166
- WELL, IT JUST WASN'T
SOMETHING THAT WE DID.

58:11.166 --> 58:14.917
- CHRISTMAS WITHOUT
A CHRISTMAS STORY.

58:14.917 --> 58:16.709
WELL, WHEN YOU GET BACK,

58:16.709 --> 58:18.291
YOU HAVE TO TELL HIM
TO READ IT TO YOU.

58:19.583 --> 58:22.000
- MY FATHER PASSED AWAY
A COUPLE YEARS AGO.

58:22.000 --> 58:24.250
- WHAT ABOUT YOUR MAMA?

58:25.959 --> 58:30.583
- ACTUALLY, SHE'S...
GONE TOO.

58:30.583 --> 58:33.875
- SO WHO WILL YOU SPEND
CHRISTMAS WITH

58:33.875 --> 58:35.250
WHEN YOU GET BACK HOME?

58:35.250 --> 58:40.500
- WELL, I USED TO HAVE IT
WITH AARON, OF COURSE.

58:42.583 --> 58:45.959
I HAVE AN AUNT
THAT I'M CLOSE TO.

58:45.959 --> 58:48.792
AND I HAVE FRIENDS THERE,

58:48.792 --> 58:51.667
YOU KNOW, BACK HOME.

58:51.667 --> 58:54.625
YOU CAN CERTAINLY HAVE CHRISTMAS
WITH YOUR FRIENDS, CAN'T YOU?

58:54.625 --> 58:56.959
I MEAN,
THERE'S NO HARD, FAST RULE

58:56.959 --> 58:59.583
THAT IT HAS TO BE WITH FAMILY.

59:01.208 --> 59:03.792
- WELL, YOU'LL HAVE
YOUR BABY NOW.

59:03.792 --> 59:05.458
YOU COULD SPEND CHRISTMAS
WITH IT AND--

59:05.458 --> 59:08.458
- MISSIE, [clears throat]
SUPPER'S GETTING COLD.

59:08.458 --> 59:10.875
HOW ABOUT A LITTLE LESS TALKING
AND A LITTLE MORE EATING?

59:12.458 --> 59:15.834
ANYWAY, THE JOY OF THE SEASON
IS-- IT'S A GIFT.

59:15.834 --> 59:18.291
IT'S RIGHT THERE FOR EVERYBODY,
RIGHT FOR THE TAKING.

59:18.291 --> 59:21.333
DOESN'T MATTER
WHERE YOU SPEND IT

59:21.333 --> 59:23.917
OR-- OR WHO YOU SPEND IT WITH.

59:44.834 --> 59:46.083
- [laughs]

59:46.083 --> 59:48.333
- OH! [laughs]

59:48.333 --> 59:51.792
- 1, 2, 3. WE GOT IT.
WE GOT IT.

01:00:03.208 --> 01:00:06.000
- THEN SHE SAID, "YOUR MAJESTY,

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:09.208
PLEASE TELL ME, YOUR MAJESTY,
WOULD YOU LIKE TO EAT SOME?"

01:00:09.208 --> 01:00:10.917
- [laughs]

01:00:10.917 --> 01:00:13.375
- PUT IT AROUND.
- THIS?

01:00:13.375 --> 01:00:16.667
- THAT'S RIGHT. OK, GOOD.
GOOD.

01:00:26.208 --> 01:00:30.542
AND AS YOU PROBABLY CAN GUESS
RIGHT ABOUT NOW...

01:00:45.208 --> 01:00:47.458
- MERRY CHRISTMAS, PA.

01:00:47.458 --> 01:00:49.166
- MERRY CHRISTMAS.

01:00:51.208 --> 01:00:52.250
- OH!

01:00:52.250 --> 01:00:54.667
[laughs]
- MERRY CHRISTMAS.

01:00:54.667 --> 01:00:57.083
- THANKS, PA.

01:00:57.083 --> 01:01:00.542
- I LOVE YOU.
- [gasps]

01:01:08.750 --> 01:01:12.917
- "THERE CAME WISE MEN
FROM THE EAST TO JERUSALEM.

01:01:12.917 --> 01:01:15.959
"WHERE IS HE THAT IS BORN
THE KING OF JEWS?

01:01:15.959 --> 01:01:18.542
"FOR WE HAVE SEEN HIS STAR GAZED

01:01:18.542 --> 01:01:21.542
"AND HAVE COME TO WORSHIP HIM.

01:01:21.542 --> 01:01:25.500
WHEN HEROD THE KING
HEARD THESE THINGS..."

01:01:41.792 --> 01:01:44.875
- MARTY?
- HMM?

01:01:44.875 --> 01:01:47.000
- WHERE DID THIS BABY COME FROM?

01:01:48.542 --> 01:01:51.875
- WELL, YOU KNOW, FROM--

01:01:51.875 --> 01:01:54.166
HASN'T YOUR PA EVER TOLD YOU?

01:01:54.166 --> 01:01:56.041
- NO.

01:01:57.583 --> 01:01:59.291
- MAYBE YOU SHOULD ASK HIM.

01:01:59.291 --> 01:02:01.208
- DON'T YOU KNOW
WHERE YOUR OWN BABY COME FROM?

01:02:01.208 --> 01:02:04.583
- "CAME FROM."
AND, YES, OF COURSE I DO.

01:02:11.125 --> 01:02:16.667
[sighs]
WELL, IT'S THE SAME AS YOU.

01:02:16.667 --> 01:02:20.291
MY HUSBAND AARON
LOVED ME SO MUCH,

01:02:20.291 --> 01:02:22.375
IT SPILLED OVER
AND MADE A BABY.

01:02:22.375 --> 01:02:23.834
- WHAT SPILLED OVER?

01:02:23.834 --> 01:02:25.792
- IT.
- WHAT'S IT?

01:02:25.792 --> 01:02:27.542
- THE LOVE.

01:02:27.542 --> 01:02:29.458
I THINK THAT BUTTON
IS STILL LOOSE.

01:02:29.458 --> 01:02:30.500
- WOW.

01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:31.750
- WHAT?

01:02:31.750 --> 01:02:33.166
- JUST THINKING ABOUT

01:02:33.166 --> 01:02:36.083
ALL THE BROTHERS AND SISTERS
CLINT HAS,

01:02:36.083 --> 01:02:38.375
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF LOVE
SPILLING OVER AT THE GRAHAMS'.

01:02:38.375 --> 01:02:40.041
- INDEED.

01:02:44.417 --> 01:02:46.667
- I WONDER IF MY PA
COULD EVER FEEL THAT WAY

01:02:46.667 --> 01:02:48.000
ABOUT SOMEONE AGAIN.

01:02:49.959 --> 01:02:51.458
- HE COULD, I GUESS.

01:02:54.709 --> 01:02:56.375
GIVE ME YOUR HAND.

01:02:56.375 --> 01:02:57.417
FEEL.

01:02:58.625 --> 01:02:59.917
- WHAT'S THAT?

01:02:59.917 --> 01:03:02.375
- THAT IS SOMEONE WHO'S GETTING
PRETTY IMPATIENT

01:03:02.375 --> 01:03:04.291
TO GET OUT AND MEET YOU.

01:03:16.875 --> 01:03:18.667
- MARTY?

01:03:19.917 --> 01:03:23.000
- I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST
BACK PAIN THAT I WAS HAVING,

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.542
BUT NOW I'M NOT SO SURE.

01:03:25.542 --> 01:03:27.667
[sighs]

01:03:27.667 --> 01:03:30.208
- ARE YOU HAVING REGULAR PAINS?
- JUST STARTING TO.

01:03:30.208 --> 01:03:32.834
- OH.
- I THINK IT'S TIME.

01:03:32.834 --> 01:03:35.375
- I'M GOING TO GO GET MISSIE.

01:03:42.083 --> 01:03:45.000
- THERE IS NO WAY
I AM LETTING YOU BE MY--

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:46.041
MY MIDWIFE!

01:03:46.041 --> 01:03:47.083
FIND SOMEONE ELSE!

01:03:47.083 --> 01:03:48.667
- THERE AIN'T NO TIME FOR THAT.

01:03:48.667 --> 01:03:49.959
- "ISN'T"!

01:03:49.959 --> 01:03:52.542
AND IT'S OK.
I'LL MAKE TIME.

01:03:52.542 --> 01:03:53.917
DID YOU DELIVER MISSIE?

01:03:53.917 --> 01:03:55.583
- NO, NO. THERE WAS SARAH.

01:03:55.583 --> 01:03:57.625
- BUT PA'S DELIVERED
PLENTY OF COWS.

01:03:57.625 --> 01:03:59.709
- THAT'S GOOD.
I FEEL SO MUCH BETTER.

01:03:59.709 --> 01:04:00.917
- I'M GOING TO NEED
PLENTY OF HOT WATER.

01:04:00.917 --> 01:04:02.709
NOW, YOU RUN OUT TO THE BARN
AND GET MY SHEARS.

01:04:02.709 --> 01:04:04.834
WE'LL NEED TO STERILIZE THEM.
- NO, MISSIE, MISSIE!

01:04:04.834 --> 01:04:05.834
DON'T YOU DARE!

01:04:05.834 --> 01:04:07.041
- GO ON.

01:04:08.667 --> 01:04:11.250
- I WOULD RATHER GIVE BIRTH
IN A FIELD

01:04:11.250 --> 01:04:12.792
THAN HAVE YOU IN HERE!

01:04:12.792 --> 01:04:15.166
- BIRTH IS A--
IS A NATURAL EVENT, MARTY.

01:04:15.166 --> 01:04:17.417
- OH, YOU FEEL WHAT I'M FEELING

01:04:17.417 --> 01:04:18.625
AND TELL ME HOW NATURAL IT IS!

01:04:18.625 --> 01:04:20.125
NOW, GET OUT!

01:04:22.458 --> 01:04:24.959
[gasps] OH GOD,
I CAN'T DO THIS ALONE.

01:04:24.959 --> 01:04:29.000
PLEASE HELP ME.
PLEASE, PLEASE, HELP ME.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:32.792
[distant moaning]

01:04:32.792 --> 01:04:34.792
- PUSH. YOU'RE DOING FINE.
YOU'RE DOING FINE.

01:04:34.792 --> 01:04:37.375
PUSH, PUSH.
- OH!

01:04:37.375 --> 01:04:38.834
- COME ON, PUSH.
- [screams]

01:04:38.834 --> 01:04:39.875
- YOU'RE DOING FINE.

01:04:39.875 --> 01:04:41.333
YOU'RE DOING FINE, MARTY.
COME ON.

01:04:45.583 --> 01:04:51.542
[baby crying]

01:04:59.250 --> 01:05:01.542
- IT'S A BOY.
COME HERE.

01:05:05.834 --> 01:05:08.166
- YOU WERE MORE LOUDER
THAN GERTIE

01:05:08.166 --> 01:05:09.458
WHEN HER BABY CAME OUT.

01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:13.166
- [laughs]

01:05:13.166 --> 01:05:15.125
- HAVE YOU GOT A NAME?

01:05:15.125 --> 01:05:17.542
- AARON LUKE.

01:05:17.542 --> 01:05:21.500
AARON AFTER HIS FATHER.
LUKE AFTER MINE.

01:05:27.208 --> 01:05:30.208
IT'S AMAZING, ISN'T IT?
- WHAT'S THAT?

01:05:30.208 --> 01:05:32.709
- THIS.

01:05:32.709 --> 01:05:35.667
A POWERFUL LOVE
THAT JUST SWEEPS OVER YOU.

01:05:37.166 --> 01:05:38.917
- IT'S AMAZING.

01:05:38.917 --> 01:05:40.917
[baby gurgling]

01:05:46.917 --> 01:05:49.917
[birds chirping]

01:05:52.291 --> 01:05:54.291
WEATHER'S MIGHTY TEMPTING.

01:05:54.291 --> 01:05:57.125
- I THOUGHT THE FRESH AIR
MIGHT DO US BOTH SOME GOOD.

01:05:57.125 --> 01:06:00.500
- YEAH. YOU WARM ENOUGH?
- MM.

01:06:03.250 --> 01:06:06.125
- HE SEEMS TO BE ENJOYING IT.
- [laughs]

01:06:06.125 --> 01:06:08.333
- HEY.

01:06:08.333 --> 01:06:10.792
[horse whinnies]

01:06:10.792 --> 01:06:12.875
IT LOOKS LIKE
WE HAVE COMPANY COMING.

01:06:12.875 --> 01:06:14.709
- PA?

01:06:14.709 --> 01:06:17.208
- GO AHEAD.
YOU CAN DO YOUR CHORES LATER.

01:06:17.208 --> 01:06:19.583
- WHOA, WHOA.

01:06:19.583 --> 01:06:22.709
- HI, CLINT.
LET'S GO PLAY.

01:06:22.709 --> 01:06:24.083
- HO!

01:06:25.917 --> 01:06:28.500
- HOWDY.
- BEN, SARAH. WELCOME.

01:06:28.500 --> 01:06:30.083
- YOU'RE LOOKING
A LITTLE MORE RESTED

01:06:30.083 --> 01:06:32.709
SINCE THE LAST TIME
I PAID A VISIT.

01:06:32.709 --> 01:06:35.041
- I CAN HARDLY BELIEVE
HE'S ALREADY A MONTH OLD.

01:06:35.041 --> 01:06:36.417
IT JUST DOESN'T SEEM POSSIBLE.

01:06:36.417 --> 01:06:39.875
- [laughs] YEAH, THEY GROW
WHEN YOU'RE NOT LOOKING.

01:06:39.875 --> 01:06:42.417
BLINK, AND YOU JUST MIGHT
MISS IT.

01:06:42.417 --> 01:06:44.709
- THAT'S WHAT CLARK SAID
ABOUT MISSIE.

01:06:44.709 --> 01:06:47.834
- CLARK UNDERSTANDS
AND APPRECIATES THAT.

01:06:47.834 --> 01:06:50.667
HE SEEMS TO BE RIGHT FOND
OF LITTLE AARON.

01:06:50.667 --> 01:06:52.375
- I THINK HE IS.

01:06:52.375 --> 01:06:57.000
- [sighs]

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.625
I BET LITTLE AARON
HAS YOU THINKING ON HIS PA

01:07:03.625 --> 01:07:05.125
A LOT LATELY, HUH?

01:07:07.291 --> 01:07:10.917
- HE WOULD HAVE BEEN SO HAPPY

01:07:10.917 --> 01:07:12.250
AND PROUD TO HAVE A SON.

01:07:12.250 --> 01:07:15.959
- BABIES ARE
A TESTAMENT TO LOVE.

01:07:15.959 --> 01:07:18.667
THEY'RE LIVING PROOF
OF WHAT YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND

01:07:18.667 --> 01:07:20.959
SHARE TOGETHER.

01:07:20.959 --> 01:07:21.291
NOBODY CAN E

01:07:21.291 --> 01:07:24.625
R CHANGE THAT.

01:07:24.625 --> 01:07:26.875
[chuckles]

01:07:26.875 --> 01:07:28.291
I STILL SEE LAURA'S DAD

01:07:28.291 --> 01:07:31.792
EVERY TIME HER CURLS
ARE BOUNCING IN THE WAGON.

01:07:31.792 --> 01:07:34.208
- BEN HAD BLONDE CURLS?

01:07:34.208 --> 01:07:36.458
- NOT BEN, MARTY.

01:07:36.458 --> 01:07:38.041
LAURA'S DADDY.

01:07:38.041 --> 01:07:40.625
HE WAS MY FIRST HUSBAND,
THORNTON.

01:07:42.625 --> 01:07:46.625
I WAS A WIDOW.
I HAD TWO LITTLE ONES.

01:07:46.625 --> 01:07:52.083
WHEN I MET BEN GRAHAM,
HE HAD 2 YOUNG'UNS OF HIS OWN.

01:07:52.083 --> 01:07:53.166
I GUESS YOU MIGHT SAY

01:07:53.166 --> 01:07:55.041
WE JOINED FORCES
OUT OF SHEER NEED.

01:07:55.041 --> 01:07:58.667
- BUT, SARAH, I...

01:07:58.667 --> 01:08:01.959
YOU AND BEN, I JUST ASSUMED
YOU LOVED EACH OTHER.

01:08:01.959 --> 01:08:04.500
- OH, WE DO...

01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:06.792
NOW.

01:08:06.792 --> 01:08:09.208
