00:13.297 --> 00:15.213

00:15.213 --> 00:16.380

00:16.380 --> 00:17.963
it's just like chicken skin.

00:17.963 --> 00:20.213

Yours are okay.

00:20.213 --> 00:22.380
- Look, they're not winning
any blue ribbons, okay,

00:22.380 --> 00:24.547
but they stuck in there.

00:24.547 --> 00:25.838
You know, they may be
a little deflated,

00:25.838 --> 00:28.588
but they're not throwing
in the towel.

00:28.588 --> 00:30.380
I like 'em.
- I'm with you.

00:30.380 --> 00:32.672
I mean, I'm not starring
in a porno anytime soon,

00:32.672 --> 00:35.130
but I breast fed my first
for five months.

00:35.130 --> 00:37.213
This is where they landed.

00:42.838 --> 00:44.172
I mean, it could be worse,
right?

00:44.172 --> 00:45.463
No, you know what,
it could be better.

00:45.463 --> 00:48.005

00:53.547 --> 00:56.130
I think it's best
that you put yourselves away.

00:57.380 --> 00:59.088
- I wasn't even breastfeeding.

00:59.088 --> 01:00.255
It just looked refreshing.

01:00.255 --> 01:02.547
- That's weird.
- You're weird, Alicia,

01:02.547 --> 01:04.297
with your homemade diaper bag.

01:04.297 --> 01:05.547
- Baby Mabel likes her bag.

01:05.547 --> 01:07.213
Baby Mabel does not
like that bag.

01:07.213 --> 01:09.213
She doesn't like anything yet
'cause she's a baby.

01:09.213 --> 01:11.255
- She's a baby.
- Okay!

01:11.255 --> 01:12.922
Today, I thought
we'd talk about

01:12.922 --> 01:14.547
how many of you are coming up

01:14.547 --> 01:16.880
on the end of your maternity
leave.

01:16.880 --> 01:19.713
Kate, I overheard
you're going back to work.

01:19.713 --> 01:21.338
Are you excited?

01:21.338 --> 01:23.213
- Uh... Yeah.

01:23.213 --> 01:25.547
A little intimidated, I guess.

01:25.547 --> 01:28.213
What's the trick
to making all this work?

01:28.213 --> 01:31.005
I'm trying to stay positive,
it's just...

01:31.005 --> 01:33.630
having it all seems a little...

01:34.672 --> 01:36.297
impossible.
(Nervous chuckle)

01:36.297 --> 01:39.505
- I find the key is setting
boundaries for yourself.

01:39.505 --> 01:40.922
A good place to start

01:40.922 --> 01:44.130
is committing to being home
for the evening routine.

01:44.130 --> 01:45.630
- Okay.
- Anyone else feeling

01:45.630 --> 01:47.422
any back-to-work jitters?

01:47.422 --> 01:48.838
This is a safe place.

01:48.838 --> 01:51.297
- Yeah. I've got my first open
house today.

01:51.297 --> 01:53.922
I'm not totally solid about it.

01:53.922 --> 01:56.047
I think I might just have
the teensiest

01:56.047 --> 01:58.797
little drop of postpartum.

01:58.797 --> 02:01.963
I was driving this morning
and...

02:01.963 --> 02:05.088
I fantasized that a car
would just hit me, you know?

02:05.088 --> 02:08.672
Just like...
(Imitates tires screeching)

02:08.672 --> 02:10.963
(Crash sound)

02:10.963 --> 02:12.380

02:12.380 --> 02:14.255
- Take me away from
all of this, you know?

02:16.588 --> 02:18.380
Not kill me.
I'm not suicidal.

02:18.380 --> 02:19.547
- No.
- Just...

02:19.547 --> 02:20.838
(Laughing)

02:21.838 --> 02:23.630
No. Sorry, guys, sorry.

02:23.630 --> 02:26.172
Just leave me brain dead
for like a week, you know?

02:26.172 --> 02:27.588
Ten days, actually.

02:27.588 --> 02:29.005
It just felt easier.

02:29.005 --> 02:30.338
- She's talking about
a vacation.

02:30.338 --> 02:31.797
- Yes! Yes.

02:33.880 --> 02:36.547

unlike your husband,

12:47.297 --> 12:49.255
were raised on a farm.

12:49.255 --> 12:51.880

the company.

company from his grandfather.

allowed in a meeting like this.
