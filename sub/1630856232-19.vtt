00:07.257 --> 00:09.634
I am so nervous going
into the playoffs right now!

00:09.676 --> 00:11.344
This is the biggest moment
of my life.

Team Reba and Gwen playoffs

00:19.310 --> 00:21.479

Team Gwen is full of threats.

00:24.399 --> 00:26.359
Gwen:
Each coach can only bring

00:26.401 --> 00:28.778
three artists to the lives.

00:28.820 --> 00:30.572
I mean, how brutal is that?

00:30.613 --> 00:33.491
Oh, my God. I think
I'm having a heart attack.

00:33.533 --> 00:36.202
Reba: I have wonderfully
talented people,

00:36.244 --> 00:38.538
but Tom had to leave
for personal reasons,

00:38.580 --> 00:41.166
so I only have
five artists tonight.

00:41.207 --> 00:43.710
My team is gonna
light the stage on fire.

You better watch.

Well, it's an early morning here
at "The Voice."

I'm so excited.
It's the playoff rounds.

00:53.470 --> 00:56.056
My motto is, "If you're
not first, you're last."

I need emotional support.

01:31.299 --> 01:33.510
Because you and I are
doing the playoff rounds.

They don't. They don't.

01:51.319 --> 01:52.946
They don't understand
a word I say, either.

01:52.987 --> 01:54.489
Jordan is a force of nature.

01:54.531 --> 01:57.534
She is a great singer,
great performer, great musician.

01:57.575 --> 02:01.705
And she brings this persona
that nobody else has.

02:01.746 --> 02:04.124

"Boondocks."

02:05.667 --> 02:06.751

Love that song.

02:06.793 --> 02:08.420
I've always loved
that song.

02:08.461 --> 02:10.714
Like, I love swampy music,
you know?
Me too.

02:10.755 --> 02:12.757
Anything that kind of starts
with a four on the floor

02:12.799 --> 02:15.135

man, I just love that.
Yeah.

* I feel no shame *

* I was born and raised
in the boondocks, hah *

02:24.978 --> 02:27.814
Coming from where I come from,
Atoka, Oklahoma,

02:27.856 --> 02:29.149
that's red-dirt country.

02:29.190 --> 02:30.817
I grew up
down a little dirt road

02:30.859 --> 02:33.653
in the boondocks around horses
and coyotes and snakes

02:33.695 --> 02:35.822
and all those kind of things
in a little log house.

02:35.864 --> 02:37.574
When you're a little kid,
you're taught, like,

02:37.615 --> 02:39.284
"Hey, you don't go outside
without your boots on

02:39.325 --> 02:41.745
'cause if the grass is a little
too tall, you get snake bit."

02:41.786 --> 02:43.580
There's a lyric
in that song that says,

02:43.621 --> 02:46.041
"I can feel that muddy water
running through my veins."

02:46.082 --> 02:47.375
I was born on the Red River.

02:47.417 --> 02:49.627
That Red River mud
is thick in my bones.

02:49.669 --> 02:54.799
* No matter where I go,
I keep my heart and soul *

02:54.841 --> 02:56.843
I'm gonna have to sing
like I've never sung before,

02:56.885 --> 02:58.678
and I'm gonna have to
show those four coaches

02:58.720 --> 03:00.555
that I can deliver
when the pressure's on.

03:00.597 --> 03:06.436

gonna do about that end part.

[ Laughs ]
It'll be magical.

03:14.235 --> 03:16.488
And I love you're
playing the banjo.
Oh, thank you.

03:16.529 --> 03:19.157
Can you play right
before the modulation?

03:19.199 --> 03:22.369
And then when you go back
into it, the band drops out,

03:22.410 --> 03:24.621
it might be a good idea
for you to go a cappella

03:24.662 --> 03:26.498
and not play
the banjo there.

03:26.539 --> 03:28.291
You're right.
Absolutely.

03:28.333 --> 03:31.419
I was really grateful for Reba's
feedback on the arrangement

03:31.461 --> 03:33.421
and the structure
because there's not a better

03:33.463 --> 03:35.423
female entertainer in the world,
in my opinion.

03:35.465 --> 03:37.884
It's something that'll be
with me the rest of my life.

03:37.926 --> 03:40.095
I think you're ready.
I'm looking forward to it.

03:40.136 --> 03:43.181
Not only are you a good singer
and a performer and entertainer,

03:43.223 --> 03:45.058
you're totally different
from anything

03:45.100 --> 03:47.519
I've ever seen
on "The Voice."

what she wants

03:49.437 --> 03:50.855

03:50.897 --> 03:53.400
She's witty.
She's got a different look.

03:53.441 --> 03:55.318
And we need her
in country music.

If there's ever a time
for me, it's now.
Yep. Absolutely.

So hopefully America
feels the same way.

be loving you.

a background singer,

09:28.651 --> 09:29.944
harmony singer
for how long?

09:29.986 --> 09:32.739
Man, I've been singing
background professionally

09:32.781 --> 09:34.074
for over 30-some years.

09:34.115 --> 09:37.118
Boz Scaggs, Michael McDonald,
Queen Latifah.

09:37.160 --> 09:39.162
Yeah, but you got
any bignames?

09:39.204 --> 09:41.623
Well, you know, I haven't
sung for Reba McIntyre yet.

09:41.664 --> 09:43.208
Ha! Got to
make that happen.

09:43.249 --> 09:46.628
* Though you don't
call me anymore *

09:46.670 --> 09:48.088
* I sit and wait *

09:48.129 --> 09:49.839
I'm singing
"Until You Come Back to Me"

09:49.881 --> 09:52.842
by the amazing queen,
Ms. Aretha Franklin.

09:52.884 --> 09:54.219
We're gonna have fun
with this one.

09:54.260 --> 09:56.888
* 'Til you come back
to me *

09:56.930 --> 09:58.723
Reba:
I think it's the perfect song.

09:58.765 --> 10:00.975
It's got range.
It's got attitude.

10:01.017 --> 10:02.852
And that's what she has.

10:02.894 --> 10:06.981
* I've got to make you see
that I-I-I-I *

10:07.023 --> 10:09.401
Ms. Monét: My personal goal
was to get to the lives.

10:09.442 --> 10:12.612
And so here I am,
a step away from that.

10:12.654 --> 10:16.324
I know what it's gonna take
for me to meet my goal.

10:16.366 --> 10:19.953
Whoo! Amazing. Amazing.
Thank you so much.

10:19.994 --> 10:21.746
That's a true performer.

10:21.788 --> 10:24.582

10:32.841 --> 10:35.218

is what the deal is.

10:35.260 --> 10:38.596
One performance before
live shows for the playoffs,

10:38.638 --> 10:41.808
so I think what Ms. Monét
needs to do is to get out there

10:41.850 --> 10:43.768
and communicate
with that audience

10:43.810 --> 10:45.520
and bring something
that they want.

10:45.562 --> 10:48.023
Glad to have you back.
My Super Save.
Thank you.

Thank God you're back.

Whoo!
Thanks to the Super Save.

13:08.538 --> 13:09.789
Great performance.

13:09.831 --> 13:12.917
Ms. Monét, you've been
such a gift to this show.

13:12.959 --> 13:14.669
My only concern
with this performance --

13:14.711 --> 13:16.838
it felt like you were doing
a lot of things.

13:16.880 --> 13:20.133
But I felt like if you
dialed it back a little bit,

13:20.175 --> 13:22.761
it would have been
a little more true to the song.

13:22.802 --> 13:25.847
But you're so good,
and you wanted to show everybody

13:25.889 --> 13:27.974
how good you were,
and you did.

13:28.016 --> 13:29.851
Thank you.
Daly: Niall.

13:29.893 --> 13:32.103
Niall: I'm such
a huge fan of yours.

13:32.145 --> 13:34.064
It was such an amazing way
to pay homage to Aretha,

13:34.105 --> 13:35.899
but also stick a bit
of Ms. Monét on it.

13:35.940 --> 13:39.861
I think you took a lot of
confidence from the Super Save,

13:39.903 --> 13:41.154
and you were like,

13:41.196 --> 13:43.031
"Now I realize why I'm here."
Exactly.

13:43.073 --> 13:45.283
Because that was the most
confident I've seen you.

13:45.325 --> 13:47.160
That was an amazing
performance.
Thank you.

13:47.202 --> 13:48.953
Alright, Coach.
Thank you.

13:48.995 --> 13:50.872
Reba, how could you have
too much of a good thing?

13:50.914 --> 13:52.248
What'd you think?

13:52.290 --> 13:54.751
Ms. Monét, to watch you
walk on the stage,

13:54.793 --> 13:57.837
I was just so proud
to know you.

13:57.879 --> 13:59.130
Thank you.

13:59.172 --> 14:00.757
You have so much
to teach all of us.

I'm just so tickled to pieces
you're back and on my team.

14:04.511 --> 14:06.137

your performance.

14:06.179 --> 14:08.056
It was just
absolutely beautiful.

14:08.098 --> 14:09.432
That was for you.

How about another big hand for
Ms. Monét, ladies and gentlemen?

14:13.269 --> 14:14.813
John: Reba's already
so emotional.

14:14.854 --> 14:16.231
There's gonna be
a lot of crying.

14:16.272 --> 14:17.941
Niall: I'm so glad
that Reba had a Super Save

14:17.982 --> 14:19.567
and brought back Ms. Monét.

14:19.609 --> 14:22.570
Every time she steps out there,
she just gives so much.

14:22.612 --> 14:25.323
And tonight she really looked
like she was fighting for it.

You go, girl. Love ya.
John: Yes, Ms. Monét.

14:27.409 --> 14:30.328
I had to make this decision
last week, and it's not easy,

14:30.370 --> 14:31.996
so I'm definitely
feeling for Reba

14:32.038 --> 14:34.666
'cause she's got one heck
of a decision coming up.

14:34.708 --> 14:36.084

Yeah.

14:36.126 --> 14:37.919
It's kind of like
first night out on tour.

14:37.961 --> 14:39.129
You're pushing.
Oh, my God.

14:39.170 --> 14:40.588
And about the fourth song,
you're like,

14:40.630 --> 14:42.090
"Would you just
take a breath?"

14:42.132 --> 14:43.216
She can sing, man.

14:43.258 --> 14:45.343

of all time coming up next.

14:59.024 --> 15:00.150
Oh, yeah.

15:00.191 --> 15:01.359
I've had artists
sing this song.

15:01.401 --> 15:02.777
I love when artists
do this song.

15:02.819 --> 15:04.070
Me too.

15:04.112 --> 15:05.822
Guess what song
I'm gonna be singing.

15:05.864 --> 15:07.282
Um, I don't know.

15:07.323 --> 15:10.160
I'm gonna be singing
Fleetwood Mac, "The Chain."

win the whole thing.

You look
so pretty today.

15:26.634 --> 15:28.386
Thanks. My mom
bought this for me.

15:28.428 --> 15:30.513
Mamas know best,
don't they?
I know.

15:30.555 --> 15:33.933
I like Jacquie's enthusiasm.

15:33.975 --> 15:35.977
She's got great stage presence.

15:36.019 --> 15:37.979
She's a strong woman singer,

15:38.021 --> 15:40.065
and she's very confident
on stage.

15:40.106 --> 15:42.609
You're gonna do
a Stevie Nicks song,

15:42.650 --> 15:44.694
but you're gonna do it
a little different.

15:44.736 --> 15:48.198
I am. I really heavily want
to pursue rock country.

15:48.239 --> 15:50.867
I started singing just
national anthems everywhere.

15:50.909 --> 15:52.369
Like you.
Yeah. Yeah.

15:52.410 --> 15:54.037
One day, I was like, "You know
what? I need to get a band."

15:54.079 --> 15:55.622
My boyfriend was like,
"Go get one."

15:55.663 --> 15:58.458
And we put together a band, and
I used to sing this with them.

15:58.500 --> 16:01.336
Eventually the band dissolved
and I decided to go solo.

16:01.378 --> 16:03.546
So I'm doing
the solo version of this.

16:03.588 --> 16:04.839
This is me.

16:04.881 --> 16:06.925
This is not Lace and Thorn.
This is Jacquie Roar.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.760
Lace and Thorn
was the name of your band?

16:08.802 --> 16:10.095
Yes.
Love that!

16:10.136 --> 16:11.554
I know. It was a really cool
band, actually.

16:11.596 --> 16:13.181
It was very
Fleetwood Mac-ish.

16:13.223 --> 16:16.184
* And if you don't love me now *

16:16.226 --> 16:19.396
* You will never love me again *

16:19.437 --> 16:21.398
Lace and Thorn
opened up the door for me.

16:21.439 --> 16:25.193
It opened my eyes to what kind
of a performer I really am.

16:25.235 --> 16:27.737
Now here I am,
right before playoffs.

16:27.779 --> 16:29.781
I can't believe
I've made it this far,

16:29.823 --> 16:32.033
and I have
so much confidence in me now

16:32.075 --> 16:33.576
that I've never had before.

16:33.618 --> 16:36.413
And it's off stage.
It's, like, mind-blowing to me.

an incredible experience.

real explosive, you know?

16:50.635 --> 16:51.845
Yeah, yeah.

16:51.886 --> 16:54.431
So, what are you thinking,
choreography-wise?

16:54.472 --> 16:57.434
I usually just let the stage
take me somewhere.

16:57.475 --> 16:59.644
The only thing
I would know to use.

16:59.686 --> 17:03.273
On that --
* You don't love me now *

17:03.314 --> 17:06.026
That is giving you
a good march.

17:06.067 --> 17:09.487
And it's a firm,
strong gesture.

17:09.529 --> 17:10.572

* Whoa, oh-oh *

19:09.607 --> 19:14.779
* Ch-a-a-a-ain *

19:14.821 --> 19:18.116
* And if you don't love me now *

19:18.158 --> 19:21.327
* You will never love me again *

19:21.369 --> 19:24.581
* I can still hear you saying *

19:24.622 --> 19:26.624
* You would never break *

19:26.666 --> 19:31.254
* Never break the chain *

19:31.296 --> 19:34.674
Jacquie!
Yo!

19:34.716 --> 19:36.551
Daly:
That is Jacquie Roar...

19:36.593 --> 19:38.178
Yes!
...for Team Reba!

19:38.219 --> 19:40.638
[ Cheers and applause ]

19:40.680 --> 19:41.931
Whoo!

19:41.973 --> 19:43.183
John, talk to us.

19:43.224 --> 19:45.268
This is my favorite
Jackie performance so far.

19:45.310 --> 19:47.228
Easy. Easily.
It was so good.

19:47.270 --> 19:48.772
[ Cheers and applause ]

19:48.813 --> 19:52.567
You made such an emphatic
statement on your behalf

19:52.609 --> 19:54.527
with this performance.
You were so tasteful

19:54.569 --> 19:56.446
in everything you did
with the arrangement.

19:56.488 --> 19:58.990
I absolutely
loved it.

19:59.032 --> 20:01.576
Thank you!
[ Laughs ]

20:01.618 --> 20:03.453
Daly: You remember your
former coach, Gwen Stefani?

20:03.495 --> 20:04.954
Gwen?
Yes, Miss Gwen.

20:04.996 --> 20:06.498
John: Ohh.

20:06.539 --> 20:09.918
I'm, like, sitting here going,
"Who are you, Gwen Stefani?

20:09.959 --> 20:12.379
Like, how could you
let her go to Reba?

20:12.420 --> 20:14.130
Like, you're so dumb."

20:14.172 --> 20:16.257
Thank you, thank you.

20:16.299 --> 20:18.301
You just never seem
to look nervous.

20:18.343 --> 20:20.011
You know exactly
what you're doing.

20:20.053 --> 20:22.722
To be able to take that song
and make it into, like,

20:22.764 --> 20:25.767
the perfect "Voice"
competition moment...

20:25.809 --> 20:29.062
And you kept turning up
the gears higher and higher

20:29.104 --> 20:30.605
and louder and stronger.

20:30.647 --> 20:33.149
And it was amazing.
And you look beautiful tonight.

20:33.191 --> 20:35.860
Absolutely beautiful.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

20:35.902 --> 20:37.487
Yes, Jacquie.

20:37.529 --> 20:39.572
Alright.
Now your coach, Reba.

20:39.614 --> 20:41.491
Jacquie, I was drawed up
in a knot

20:41.533 --> 20:43.743
when you started
walking up those stairs

20:43.785 --> 20:46.579
and then singing that
one part right on pitch.

20:46.621 --> 20:50.000
You went from that big,
big note back to this,

20:50.041 --> 20:52.002
which is very hard to do.

20:52.043 --> 20:53.211
Nailed it.

20:53.253 --> 20:55.005
Thank you so much.
Wow!

20:55.046 --> 20:57.966
Daly: Give it up one more time
for Jacquie Roar

20:58.008 --> 20:59.009
from Team Reba.

20:59.050 --> 21:00.343
[ Cheers and applause ]
Thank you!

21:00.385 --> 21:02.262
Yes!

21:02.303 --> 21:03.763
Jacquie has grown so much.

21:03.805 --> 21:07.308
Oh, my gosh. I was so proud
of her performance.

21:07.350 --> 21:08.852
She brought her "A"-game.

21:08.893 --> 21:10.520
When you're confident
in who you are,

21:10.562 --> 21:12.605
you know who you are
as an artist.

21:12.647 --> 21:16.693
And that's who will be going on
to the live shows.

21:16.735 --> 21:19.863
But with Jordan, Ms. Monét,
and then Jacquie --

21:19.904 --> 21:24.034
three different performers,
different styles.

21:24.075 --> 21:25.452
Y'all pray for me.

21:25.493 --> 21:26.911
That was crazy.

21:26.953 --> 21:28.371
Best arrangement of the season.
That was crazy.

21:28.413 --> 21:29.914
Wow!
Geez. That was good.

21:29.956 --> 21:32.792
That was by far her best
performance of the whole season.

21:32.834 --> 21:34.669
Just earning it
on the stage.

21:34.711 --> 21:36.963
Yeah. She's a show dog.
Mm-hmm.

21:43.261 --> 21:44.512
* This is "The Voice" *

21:44.554 --> 21:45.764
Daly:
Welcome back to the playoffs

21:45.805 --> 21:47.599
at Universal Studios Hollywood.

21:47.640 --> 21:49.934
Man, it is so nice
to just chill

21:49.976 --> 21:53.021
and watch Gwen and Reba
agonize over today.

21:53.063 --> 21:55.815
We get to just relax, man.
I know. Totally.

21:55.857 --> 21:59.361
You think they think they have
better teams than us?

21:59.402 --> 22:00.904
Reba: Yeah.

22:00.945 --> 22:03.907
[Chuckling] Gwen actually thinks
that she can win this thing.

22:03.948 --> 22:05.241
[ Laughs ]

22:05.283 --> 22:08.203
Well, she is an icon.
She has won the show before.

22:08.244 --> 22:10.121
Yeah. That's true.

22:10.163 --> 22:12.874
And Reba's -- I mean,
she is the queen of country.

22:12.916 --> 22:15.627
So many hits.
A massive audience.

22:15.669 --> 22:17.212
It's pretty undeniable.

22:21.049 --> 22:22.384
Are you worried?

Nah. Pfft.

Ha! Ha!

22:32.185 --> 22:34.479
They have no chance, man!
They have no chance.

22:34.521 --> 22:37.023
No chance, buddy. Ha.
Not a chance.

22:37.065 --> 22:39.275
Should we just go on and
pretend they're not threats?

22:39.317 --> 22:41.695
Yeah, yeah.
They're not threats.
Let's just do that.

22:41.736 --> 22:44.406
We got this.
Let's go!

22:44.447 --> 22:47.534
Reba: I love Noah because
I love his vocal range.

22:47.575 --> 22:50.161
His tone
is in the country realm,

22:50.203 --> 22:52.997
but he's more folksy
than real country.

22:53.039 --> 22:54.541
You're just too good
to go home.

22:54.582 --> 22:55.875
Oh. Thank you.
I appreciate that.

22:55.917 --> 22:57.711
And I was thrilled
to get to steal you.

22:57.752 --> 22:59.629
I thought for sure
I was headed home.

22:59.671 --> 23:01.047

23:01.089 --> 23:03.049
Reba turned around,
then John turned around.

23:03.091 --> 23:05.677
I got to make the hometown
proud. I'm going with Reba here.

23:05.719 --> 23:08.304
Queen Reba
steals Noah!

23:08.346 --> 23:10.682
I'm coming here representing
Richlands, Virginia.

23:10.724 --> 23:12.684
I stepped on an airplane
for the first time.

23:12.726 --> 23:14.519
Now, having been here
and working with

23:14.561 --> 23:15.979
Niall Horan and Reba,

23:16.021 --> 23:18.314
it's just more than I ever
could have imagined.

23:18.356 --> 23:21.860
When I saw this song, "Jolene,"
that you wanted to do today,

23:21.901 --> 23:23.945
I thought, "You're gonna
do Dolly's 'Jolene'?"

23:23.987 --> 23:25.280
And it's totally different.

23:25.321 --> 23:26.698
No, not quite
the same one.

23:26.740 --> 23:30.535
* Jolene *

23:30.577 --> 23:36.207
* I ain't about to
go straight *

23:36.249 --> 23:37.876
For playoffs,
I'll be singing "Jolene"

23:37.917 --> 23:39.210
by Ray LaMontagne.

23:39.252 --> 23:41.713
Coming from a small town,
about 5,000 people,

23:41.755 --> 23:43.673
growing up,
I never really saw people

23:43.715 --> 23:45.175
pursuing careers in music,

23:45.216 --> 23:47.093
and I knew it was always
something that I wanted to do,

23:47.135 --> 23:49.054
and I've never really had
an idea how to do it.

23:49.095 --> 23:52.807
* I, I still don't know *

23:52.849 --> 23:55.018
* I still don't know
what love means *

23:55.060 --> 23:56.644
And the fact
that I am here now

23:56.686 --> 23:59.272
makes me want to keep pushing
and make it as far as I can,

23:59.314 --> 24:01.691
so hopefully you all see me
at the lives.

24:01.733 --> 24:04.235
Very nice.

24:04.277 --> 24:07.405
Now, this is the first time
we get to work together.

24:07.447 --> 24:08.782
Yep.
You've got a great voice.

24:08.823 --> 24:11.451
Your eyes are
another communicator.

24:11.493 --> 24:13.036
I'm your audience.

24:13.078 --> 24:16.748
You looked everywhere
in this room except here.

24:16.790 --> 24:19.417
And you're telling a story
to your audience.

24:19.459 --> 24:21.544
And so you look at me.
You tell me a line.

24:21.586 --> 24:23.505
You tell her a line
or him a line.

24:23.546 --> 24:25.757
And when it's sad,
you're sad.

24:25.799 --> 24:27.926
When it's uplifting,
smile about it

24:27.967 --> 24:30.220
and let that smile
show in your eyes.

24:30.261 --> 24:32.347
And when you smile when
you sing, I can hear it.

24:32.389 --> 24:36.976
It's a great song for him to do.
It's right in his wheelhouse.

24:37.018 --> 24:40.105
I think what Noah needs to do to
make it to the live performance

24:40.146 --> 24:44.275
is really bring out
that inner self and give more.

24:44.317 --> 24:46.903
It was nice to finally
get to meet you and stuff.
I know.

24:46.945 --> 24:48.446
And I've seen you up
on the stage.

24:48.488 --> 24:50.281
Noah: There is a lot more to me
than meets the eye.

24:50.323 --> 24:51.825
There's a lot more artistry
inside of me

24:51.866 --> 24:53.284
that I haven't shown yet
on this show.

24:53.326 --> 24:54.953
Us coaches, you're
just standing there

24:54.994 --> 24:57.706
waiting on somebody
to come by and say hi.

24:57.747 --> 24:59.124
I appreciate you.
Thank you.

24:59.165 --> 25:01.126
I'm gonna go out there
and do what I can,

25:01.167 --> 25:03.586
and we're gonna see
what happens.

because you're such
an amazing talent.

27:22.142 --> 27:24.477
Your voice is so unique
in this competition,

27:24.519 --> 27:27.230
and I love that song on you.
I thought you were able to show

27:27.272 --> 27:29.107
all the different parts
of your voice,

27:29.149 --> 27:31.192
that kind of raspy edge
that we like

27:31.234 --> 27:33.319
and then also the softer side
there towards the end.

27:33.361 --> 27:36.656
It was a really, really
super-impressive performance.

Thank you.

saying anything,

but there's just energy,
but when you're performing,

27:50.170 --> 27:52.297
I feel like I get to know you
a little bit more.

She is so smart
for a 16-year-old, so talented.

a true fan of country music.

I will be singing

29:49.873 --> 29:51.416
"Long Long Time"

29:51.458 --> 29:53.251
I don't know if I can
really connect to it

29:53.293 --> 29:55.337
because, you know, I haven't
been in a relationship.

29:55.378 --> 29:57.505
I haven't been through
any struggles like that.

29:57.547 --> 29:59.215
But I connect
with Linda Ronstadt

29:59.257 --> 30:00.592
because she started young,

30:00.633 --> 30:02.969
and I started singing
when I was 9 and a half.

30:03.011 --> 30:05.305
So being a girl, you know,
and being thrown

30:05.347 --> 30:08.308

a wonderful country singer.

so much breath

30:36.211 --> 30:37.671

through her vocals

30:41.508 --> 30:43.343

so powerfully,

30:59.109 --> 31:00.527
That way,
you've got breath

31:00.568 --> 31:02.529
instead of trying
to hold it all out,

31:02.570 --> 31:04.698

if you chop it up.

38:35.815 --> 38:38.401
I mean, to have three women

38:38.443 --> 38:40.487
going to lives
on Reba's team.
That's right.

38:40.528 --> 38:41.863
That's freaking awesome.

38:41.905 --> 38:45.200
I've got my first
live-show team.

38:45.241 --> 38:48.036
They're all three country,
but they're all three different.

38:48.078 --> 38:51.664
You could put those three,
package them on a concert tour.

38:51.706 --> 38:53.249
They'd each blow
the audience away.

38:53.291 --> 38:56.336
We're gonna go kick some butt
and win this sucker.

38:56.378 --> 38:58.672
Whoo!
That's right.
Team Reba, y'all!

38:58.713 --> 39:00.131
We're gonna win.
We're winning.

39:00.173 --> 39:01.383
Playoffs, baby.

39:01.424 --> 39:04.135
Now I can sit back and relax.
Thank you, Lord.

39:04.177 --> 39:06.888
And now I'm gonna watch
Gwen choose her team.

39:06.930 --> 39:08.556
Praying for her, too.

39:08.598 --> 39:09.891
Alright, Gwennie.
Yeah.

39:09.933 --> 39:12.602
You're up.
Oh, no!

39:20.402 --> 39:21.945
* This is "The Voice" *

39:21.986 --> 39:25.156
Daly:
Welcome back to "The Voice."

39:25.198 --> 39:27.367
Woman: You doknow
how to tie your shoe!

39:27.409 --> 39:28.785
A callback.

39:28.827 --> 39:31.746
I couldn't even
tie my shoelaces at 13.

39:31.788 --> 39:33.039
And I still haven't learned.

39:33.081 --> 39:35.333
That's a you problem,
Niall.

39:35.375 --> 39:37.210
Look at me now.

39:37.252 --> 39:39.170
Woman: We're so proud
of you, Niall!

39:39.212 --> 39:40.672
Thank you.

39:40.714 --> 39:43.091
* He's a big boy now *

39:43.133 --> 39:46.011
[ Laughter ]

39:46.052 --> 39:48.346
Gwen: Welcome to my team!
Stee: Gwen!

39:48.388 --> 39:51.391
Gosh. You're, like, one
of the greatest singers
of this entire show.

39:51.433 --> 39:53.101
Oh. Thank you so much.

39:53.143 --> 39:54.060
It's the truth!

39:54.102 --> 39:56.438
Stee is my steal
from John Legend.

39:56.479 --> 40:00.275
Daly: Wow! Immediately!
A steal from Gwen Stefani!

40:00.316 --> 40:02.193
Gwen: I've been eyeing him
since the blinds.

40:02.235 --> 40:05.613
He is one of the best singers
on this season,

40:05.655 --> 40:07.615
so he brings a lot to my team.

40:07.657 --> 40:09.993
You know what I was, like,
trying to think about this song?

40:10.035 --> 40:11.619
Because at first,
I was kind of like...

40:11.661 --> 40:12.787
Why this song?
Yeah.

40:12.829 --> 40:14.122
So, I'm in a band,

40:14.164 --> 40:15.874
and we do this song
all the time.
Yeah.

40:15.915 --> 40:18.626
When people hear that...
[Imitates song intro]

40:18.668 --> 40:20.962
It's like
they lose their minds!

40:21.004 --> 40:24.174
And, for me, it's always been
my dream to have a song

40:24.215 --> 40:26.217
that moves people
in that way.
Yeah. Yeah.

40:26.259 --> 40:28.720
I'm doing "Shut Up and Dance"
by Walk the Moon.

40:28.762 --> 40:31.139
* Shut up
and dance with me *

40:31.181 --> 40:33.224
This is a song
that I do with my band,

40:33.266 --> 40:36.394
but a lot of the gigs that we do
are black-tie events,

40:36.436 --> 40:38.271
your weddings, your banquets.

40:38.313 --> 40:40.398
You know, you want to
keep it very corporate

40:40.440 --> 40:41.775
and very professional.

40:41.816 --> 40:45.236
And as an artist,
I want to be Stee

40:45.278 --> 40:49.366
and be more free and
more relaxed in my expression.

40:49.407 --> 40:51.034
* Ooh-ooh-ohh *

40:51.076 --> 40:57.707
* Shut up
and dance with m-e-e-e-e *

40:57.749 --> 40:59.167
Yeah!
Yes!

40:59.209 --> 41:00.168
That felt great!

41:00.210 --> 41:02.379
[ Laughs ]
Oh, my God.

41:02.420 --> 41:06.174
The way you perform is
quite, like, professional.

41:06.216 --> 41:08.093
I would be curious to see
if you added in

41:08.134 --> 41:10.011
a little bit more,
like, edge

41:10.053 --> 41:12.013
so it's a little less
theatrical.

41:12.055 --> 41:13.807
Yes.
You can take it two ways.

41:13.848 --> 41:15.517
Like --
* Shut Up and dance *

41:15.558 --> 41:18.353
Or you can be like --
"Shut up and dance with me *

41:18.395 --> 41:19.813
Boom, boom, boom.
Hey!

41:19.854 --> 41:21.356
You get a little bit
more like...

41:21.398 --> 41:23.441
I love it.
Just a little more,
like, edge to it.

41:23.483 --> 41:24.567
Got you.

41:24.609 --> 41:26.319
Gwen is extremely insightful.

41:26.361 --> 41:29.739
If you can bring that other
side that no one's seen yet,

41:29.781 --> 41:31.241
it's gonna make
all the difference.

41:31.282 --> 41:33.451
I'm gonna focus on the notes
that Gwen gave me

41:33.493 --> 41:34.994
and just deliver on that.

41:35.036 --> 41:36.329
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

41:36.371 --> 41:38.039
Gwen: This song
is a smart choice,

41:38.081 --> 41:40.500
but it's more about
the stage presence

41:40.542 --> 41:41.835
and making it believable.

41:41.876 --> 41:43.294
See you later, Stee.
Have a good one!

41:43.336 --> 41:45.922
But he's very skilled
and he can do anything.

41:45.964 --> 41:47.882
[ Cheers and applause ]

41:47.924 --> 41:49.884
Good luck, Gwen.
Thank you.

Let's go!

44:20.118 --> 44:22.912
You've done such a diverse
spectrum of songs.

44:22.954 --> 44:25.415
What you've shown is that
you can really do anything,

44:25.457 --> 44:28.209
and you come up on the stage
with such a level

44:28.251 --> 44:30.211
of polish
and professionalism.

we've heard from those coaches,

45:12.462 --> 45:14.005
but there's only one opinion
that matters,

45:14.047 --> 45:15.423
and that's Gwen Stefani.
Hi, Gwen.

45:15.465 --> 45:16.925
No pressure.

45:16.966 --> 45:19.511
I can't believe I got you.
I stole you from John Legend.

I mean, I was -- It was like
I was in shock when it happened.

45:22.597 --> 45:25.350
This song, it's harder to do
than a ballad.

45:25.392 --> 45:28.269
It's harder to do than, like,
even, like, a rock song.

45:28.311 --> 45:29.771
I thought you did a great job.

45:29.813 --> 45:32.357
We worked on trying
to maybe unpolish you

45:32.399 --> 45:34.651
a little bit to make you
just a little bit more, "Oh!"

45:34.693 --> 45:37.278
That other side of you,
the little more edgier side.

45:37.320 --> 45:39.280
And I saw that
in that performance tonight.

45:39.322 --> 45:41.825
I've really loved
working with you and...

I think Stee did great.

45:50.625 --> 45:53.753

is he has, like, a lot of range.

I need in the live show,

for his performance.

Because like you said,
everything's really slick.

and I loved it.

46:10.103 --> 46:12.480
Going into the lives,
I'd really love

46:12.522 --> 46:14.566

that's just unique

of who they are as an artist,

on Team Gwen.

some tough decisions.

do this tomorrow, so...

in your little cowboy hat.

What are you gonna do?

46:49.642 --> 46:50.852
I know

46:50.894 --> 46:52.562
I think that BIAS --
he's a really good singer

46:52.604 --> 46:56.066
'cause he is kind of soulful
on top of his stage presence

46:56.107 --> 46:57.609
and that "it" factor
that he has.

46:57.650 --> 47:00.070
You just want to keep
knowing more about him

47:00.111 --> 47:02.697
because he's just unique.

47:02.739 --> 47:05.283
This is my last chance
to get to, like, choose,

47:05.325 --> 47:07.410
and then it goes
to America.
I know.

47:07.452 --> 47:09.329
There's just
something about you.

47:09.371 --> 47:12.332
Like, just the way
you're able to be so honest

47:12.374 --> 47:14.834
and so you, it's rare.
Thank you.

47:14.876 --> 47:17.712
* That night
I hit rock bottom *

47:17.754 --> 47:19.422
BIAS: For the playoffs,
I'm gonna be singing

47:19.464 --> 47:21.800
"Where I Find God"
by Larry Fleet.

47:21.841 --> 47:24.260
* He paid my tab
and put me in a cab *

47:24.302 --> 47:25.762
This song is perfect for me

47:25.804 --> 47:28.515
because I get a chance
to show who I am.

47:28.556 --> 47:29.933
* And he could see... *

47:29.974 --> 47:32.185
I'm always one that's
bouncing around on stage,

47:32.227 --> 47:34.354
but this one, I'm reserved.

47:34.396 --> 47:36.564
I just want this to be a moment,

47:36.606 --> 47:38.608
and I just want to
resonate with people.

47:38.650 --> 47:42.862
* 'Cause I didn't feel
worth savin', no *

47:42.904 --> 47:45.281
I think you're gonna see
the really redneck

47:45.323 --> 47:46.700
side of BIAS this time around.

47:46.741 --> 47:49.536
* Sunday mornin'
in a church pew *

47:49.577 --> 47:51.538
My home is
Chattanooga, Tennessee.

47:51.579 --> 47:53.790
There's about a couple cows
and a lot of grass.

47:53.832 --> 47:55.417
Mile two.

47:55.458 --> 47:57.961
So country music
is a huge influence on my life.

47:58.003 --> 48:00.964
But I'm a little bit of soul.
I'm a little bit of funk.

48:01.006 --> 48:02.382
I'm a little bit
of all that stuff

48:02.424 --> 48:03.967
just combined into one.

48:04.009 --> 48:07.637
* I do that a lot *

48:07.679 --> 48:09.681
Oh, my God.
You're making me get chills.

48:09.723 --> 48:13.727
Maybe you should go back
to being a worship leader.

48:13.768 --> 48:16.438
One thing is, you had
your eyes shut a lot.

48:16.479 --> 48:17.772
I didn't really mind it.

48:17.814 --> 48:19.524
It is sort of a prayer
and a confession.

48:19.566 --> 48:23.319
So just finding those
perfect moments in the song

48:23.361 --> 48:25.030
to deliver those moments.
Right.

48:25.071 --> 48:26.406
Gwen had some great notes.

48:26.448 --> 48:27.866
I want to take in
everything she says

48:27.907 --> 48:29.909
so that I make her proud
on playoff day.

48:29.951 --> 48:32.912
It's just such a simple kind
of story, but so relatable,

48:32.954 --> 48:34.998
and I think you can
deliver it really well.

48:35.040 --> 48:36.332
Okay.
And then at the end,

48:36.374 --> 48:38.168
just getting a little bit
more emotional

48:38.209 --> 48:40.503
with the soulful part
of your voice.

48:40.545 --> 48:42.505
I think that's gonna be
a win right there.
Sweet.

48:42.547 --> 48:44.632
BIAS is my only
country person on my team,

48:44.674 --> 48:46.509
and that's really
important to me.

48:46.551 --> 48:50.430
I'm so proud of myself that
I pressed my button for you.

48:50.472 --> 48:51.973
I'mproud of you.

48:52.015 --> 48:54.267
I'm hoping that what he'll show
in this next performance

48:54.309 --> 48:56.144
is that he can really
connect to a lyric.

48:56.186 --> 48:59.022
I think if he does that,
he has a really good chance

48:59.064 --> 49:00.815
of going through to the lives.

49:00.857 --> 49:04.361
BIAS! Yee-haw!

49:04.402 --> 49:05.487
He looks good.

49:05.528 --> 49:06.905
He looks like
a bullfighter.

49:06.946 --> 49:08.281
Gwen: I know!

49:08.323 --> 49:10.909
Singing "Where I Find God,"
here is BIAS.

Everybody in Tennessee,
in that region there,

It was really nice to see

51:48.066 --> 51:50.694
the more toned-back side
of you this time.

51:50.735 --> 51:53.196
That run you did towards the end
was beautiful,

I would put BIAS through.

in the air.

and the exact right delivery.

what you needed to do.

there you go, BIAS.

you'd be through, no problem.

it's all about right there.

it catches on now.

53:19.491 --> 53:22.410
He sings with this
really cool soulfulness,

53:22.452 --> 53:23.953
and he has this individuality.

53:23.995 --> 53:26.414
This was his best performance,
and it was in a moment

53:26.456 --> 53:29.751
that really counted
when he had to convince Gwen

53:29.793 --> 53:32.962
to pick him
for the live shows.

53:33.004 --> 53:35.298
BIAS: We've got a bunch
of great people on this team,

how it's gonna go down.

53:37.550 --> 53:39.177

53:39.219 --> 53:40.720
That was the best so far.
That gave me chills.

is beautiful.

54:20.593 --> 54:22.679
She has so much swag.

54:22.721 --> 54:27.142
But she did a song that was
challenging in the knockouts.

The winner of this knockout
is gonna be Tanner.

staying with Gwen.

54:54.669 --> 54:56.421
I did not mean
to scare you like that.

54:56.463 --> 54:59.132
I think that there's more to her
than just that moment,

54:59.174 --> 55:02.260
and I wanted to save her and see
what else she could give me.

55:02.302 --> 55:04.095
You knew that I was
gonna pick you.

55:04.137 --> 55:06.973

to where she was like,

55:34.334 --> 55:35.794
"I can't. No more."

I do wish I had another

She's singing it
in English and Spanish,

Spanish, I do feel it.
I got chills.

56:40.984 --> 56:43.820
Just don't let it be
only about the vocal.
Yeah.

56:43.862 --> 56:46.865
Let it be the lyric
and your heart.

56:46.906 --> 56:49.117
I'm thankful
for Gwen Stefani.

56:49.159 --> 56:51.870
I know she wants me to just
go and connect with this song

56:51.911 --> 56:54.164
as much as possible,
sing the crap out of it.

56:54.205 --> 56:56.374
So I just need to
get my mind together,

and do what I know I can do.

what'd you think?

59:28.151 --> 59:29.486
That was really,
really special.

59:29.527 --> 59:31.196
You did such
a beautiful job on it.

59:31.237 --> 59:32.864
In your case, the longer
the song goes on,

59:32.906 --> 59:35.450
the better you get, and
just there towards the end,

59:35.492 --> 59:37.535
it's like you've done
the hard graft at the start,

59:37.577 --> 59:39.704
and you were just like,
"Alright, let me take off now

59:39.746 --> 59:41.164
and show you what I can do."

59:41.206 --> 59:42.999
Every time you come out here,
you always smash it.

59:43.041 --> 59:45.418
Thank you.
And I thought it was a really
special performance today.

59:45.460 --> 59:47.879
Thank you so much.
It was really good.

59:47.921 --> 59:49.047
Daly: John?

59:49.089 --> 59:51.466
What a challenging song.

59:51.508 --> 59:52.676
Niall: Yeah.

59:52.717 --> 59:54.219
Every time, she chooses
a challenging one.

59:54.260 --> 59:55.637
I was like, "Wow.
This is hard."

59:55.679 --> 59:58.223
And I think maybe with
the breathing at the beginning,

59:58.264 --> 01:00:01.351
it might be a matter of slowing
the tempo down a little bit.

01:00:01.393 --> 01:00:04.521
You just felt like you
were trying to catch up
with it all the time.

01:00:04.562 --> 01:00:05.730
Yeah.

01:00:05.772 --> 01:00:07.482
Taking on Mariah Carey,
like, it's difficult.

01:00:07.524 --> 01:00:09.359
Yeah.
And you're such
a gifted singer.

01:00:09.401 --> 01:00:11.778

challenging yourself like that.

I could imagine you
on a record.

Your style of singing,
because it's so intricate --

01:00:41.307 --> 01:00:44.728
Like, you do so many
little things with your voice.

01:00:44.769 --> 01:00:46.604
And your gift
to be able

01:00:46.646 --> 01:00:49.399
to interpret lyrics
and your emotion.

a lot of tenderness

and details to her voice.

I think she could be really
great for my live-show team,

but I don't know
what I'm gonna do

01:01:13.340 --> 01:01:16.301
because she's up against people
like Stee and BIAS.

01:01:16.343 --> 01:01:17.469
She's a great singer.

kind of everything that you
would want in a new artist.

that it's his story.

My parents could not come with,
which is really weird

01:02:17.862 --> 01:02:19.406
'cause I had to, like,
come out here by myself.

anything like that,

are with me, so...

My parents supporting me
this entire time

than they know.

I don't tell them enough,

01:02:30.458 --> 01:02:32.711

every single time they call,

every single time
that they're worried about me.

Tanner is singing "Impossible"
by Shontelle.

01:02:49.144 --> 01:02:51.354
The song actually
fits Tanner perfectly.

01:02:51.396 --> 01:02:54.024
He has a little bit
of an alternative edge,

01:02:54.065 --> 01:02:56.317
but he also feels quite pop.

I got to be honest.

01:03:00.655 --> 01:03:02.490
I think that Tanner,
out of everybody on my team,

01:03:02.532 --> 01:03:06.453
has a really good chance of
making it outside of the show.

01:03:06.494 --> 01:03:10.206
Each time he performs, he's
seeing his gift even clearer.

01:03:10.248 --> 01:03:11.583
I think he just needs to now,

01:03:11.624 --> 01:03:13.793

and write songs.

You have
such good instincts.

01:03:21.593 --> 01:03:22.761
The only thing I can think of

01:03:22.802 --> 01:03:24.679
to maybe work with
on your vocals

01:03:24.721 --> 01:03:27.557
is sometimes it feels like
it's getting a little pinched.

01:03:27.599 --> 01:03:29.392
There was a couple parts
where I think

01:03:29.434 --> 01:03:31.644
you could not crunch down
so hard on your voice.

01:03:31.686 --> 01:03:33.355
You know what I mean?
Just --
Right.

01:03:33.396 --> 01:03:35.190
Just a little bit more open.
The tension for sure.

01:03:35.231 --> 01:03:36.524
Yeah.
As far as, like, lyrically,

01:03:36.566 --> 01:03:38.234
I think it's just be real.

01:03:38.276 --> 01:03:39.778
When you just listen
to what the song is,

01:03:39.819 --> 01:03:42.989
it will lead you to the truth
of what that lyric is.

01:03:43.031 --> 01:03:44.616
You know what I mean?
Yeah.

01:03:44.657 --> 01:03:46.493
And that's what I think people
are gonna love about you,

01:03:46.534 --> 01:03:49.329
is that I see that come through
in the way that you sing.

01:03:49.371 --> 01:03:50.413
And that's all you want.

01:03:50.455 --> 01:03:51.873
Awesome.
Right?

01:03:51.915 --> 01:03:53.750

has to make me forget

that he's 19 years old

01:04:01.633 --> 01:04:05.553
and he needs to sing this song
like it's his story.

01:04:05.595 --> 01:04:06.763
I'm gonna make you proud.
I swear.

01:04:06.805 --> 01:04:07.972

Daly: That is Tanner Massey
giving it all he's got

01:06:22.273 --> 01:06:25.985
in the playoffs for Team Gwen.

01:06:26.027 --> 01:06:27.529
Tanner, we all love you.

01:06:27.570 --> 01:06:29.072
I feel like the beginning,
I wasn't sure

01:06:29.114 --> 01:06:30.657
if you were hearing
the key exactly.

01:06:30.699 --> 01:06:31.908
Yeah.
Ohh.

01:06:31.950 --> 01:06:32.992
But then once everything

01:06:33.034 --> 01:06:36.413
kind of came together,
it felt so good.

01:06:36.454 --> 01:06:38.790
And you hit a note
so unexpected,

01:06:38.832 --> 01:06:40.667
we all just looked
at each other like, "Ooh!"

01:06:40.709 --> 01:06:42.168
Yeah.
[ Laughter ]

01:06:42.210 --> 01:06:43.670
And what I absolutely loved

01:06:43.712 --> 01:06:46.631
is just how much passion
you were showing.

01:06:46.673 --> 01:06:48.800
And I think our audience is
gonna connect with that, too.

01:06:48.842 --> 01:06:50.885
Thank you.
Thank you, Coach.
Reba.

01:06:50.927 --> 01:06:53.680
Oh, I agree 100%.
You did have a lot of passion.

01:06:53.722 --> 01:06:56.182
And have I told you today
that you're cute as a button?

01:06:56.224 --> 01:06:57.183
[ Laughter ]

01:06:57.225 --> 01:06:58.727
You know,
I think you did.

01:06:58.768 --> 01:07:00.645
Well, you know, I say that
every time I see you,

01:07:00.687 --> 01:07:02.105
so I just wanted to know.

01:07:02.147 --> 01:07:03.481
I loved your performance.

01:07:03.523 --> 01:07:06.151
I think your voice
is really, really good.

01:07:06.192 --> 01:07:07.485
Thank you so much.

01:07:07.527 --> 01:07:09.487
You got a great chance
of going to the top.

01:07:09.529 --> 01:07:10.989
I appreciate that.
Niall.

01:07:11.031 --> 01:07:14.034
My man, Tanner.
Every time, dude.

01:07:14.075 --> 01:07:15.285
I'm just really happy

01:07:15.326 --> 01:07:17.495
how this competition
has progressed for you,

01:07:17.537 --> 01:07:19.247
even though,
like, I had to lose you.

01:07:19.289 --> 01:07:21.249
And you remind me of me
when I was younger,

01:07:21.291 --> 01:07:22.709
like, just the will to learn.

01:07:22.751 --> 01:07:24.210
That was a really
passionate performance.

01:07:24.252 --> 01:07:26.171
I've spoken way too much.
I'm just a big fan.

Have we told you
you're cute as a button?

01:07:31.217 --> 01:07:32.552
Have we told you?

01:07:32.594 --> 01:07:34.929
And as Reba would say,
I was tickled to pieces.

[ Laughter ]

01:07:36.139 --> 01:07:37.724
Alright, Gwen,
give us some thoughts

01:07:37.766 --> 01:07:39.059
on Tanner's performance.

01:07:39.100 --> 01:07:40.727
Well, I wanted to work
with you so bad

01:07:40.769 --> 01:07:42.979
because I actually really enjoy

01:07:43.021 --> 01:07:45.940
working with the younger people
like you because --

01:07:45.982 --> 01:07:48.360
especially a boy.
I have three boys of my own.

01:07:48.401 --> 01:07:49.903
And you're 19 years old.

01:07:49.944 --> 01:07:51.488
I mean, it's crazy.
Thank you.

01:07:51.529 --> 01:07:53.865
I'm sad about the beginning,
but I understand.

01:07:53.907 --> 01:07:55.533
It happens to me all the time.

01:07:55.575 --> 01:07:58.411
I actually have cues in my ears
on stage for certain songs.

01:07:58.453 --> 01:08:00.038
Yes.
Literally on stage it's like,

01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:02.582
"Turn left. Smile."
[ Laughter ]

01:08:02.624 --> 01:08:03.917
It's true.

01:08:03.958 --> 01:08:05.835
We get all these
little things in our ears.

01:08:05.877 --> 01:08:07.921
Say "Hollaback Girl."
Okay.

01:08:07.962 --> 01:08:08.713
[ Laughter ]

01:08:08.755 --> 01:08:10.048
It's true. We do it.

01:08:10.090 --> 01:08:12.258
You've grown a lot
just before my eyes

01:08:12.300 --> 01:08:13.677
in a short amount of time.

01:08:13.718 --> 01:08:16.304
And I'm just super proud,
super proud of you.

01:08:16.346 --> 01:08:17.639
Thank you so much.

01:08:17.681 --> 01:08:19.599
Daly: Give it up
for Tanner Massey one more time.

01:08:19.641 --> 01:08:20.767
Thank you, everyone.

01:08:20.809 --> 01:08:22.602
Tanner's performance
was amazing.

01:08:22.644 --> 01:08:25.271
I'm so proud of him.
He's the real deal.

01:08:25.313 --> 01:08:26.940
Really regret letting Tanner go.

01:08:26.981 --> 01:08:28.817
I have a feeling it's gonna
come back to bite me

01:08:28.858 --> 01:08:31.027
if he gets through to the lives.

Alright, Gwen tell us about
your Super Save

01:08:44.374 --> 01:08:45.959
and why you saved this artist.

01:08:46.001 --> 01:08:49.170
Well, my Super Save
was for an artist

01:08:49.212 --> 01:08:50.922
that I feel
is just so unique.

01:08:50.964 --> 01:08:52.841
I needed to bring him back
to Team Gwen.

01:08:52.882 --> 01:08:54.509
Who is he?
Who is it, you guys?

01:08:54.551 --> 01:08:55.844
Who could it be?

01:08:55.885 --> 01:08:58.096
They basically said
that we could choose,

01:08:58.138 --> 01:09:02.225
like, anybody out of any team --
right? -- to bring back.

01:09:02.267 --> 01:09:04.019
And I was like, "Hmm.

01:09:04.060 --> 01:09:06.646
I'm gonna call Lennon and see
if he wants to come back."

01:09:06.688 --> 01:09:08.773
Would you like that?
Wow, like...

01:09:08.815 --> 01:09:10.233
Thank you so much.
I'm ready.

01:09:10.275 --> 01:09:12.027
Let's do it.
Alright. Let's do it.

* Just like those old stars *

01:09:15.905 --> 01:09:17.699
Gwen:
Lennon is a singer-songwriter

01:09:17.741 --> 01:09:19.367
that has this very unique tone.

01:09:19.409 --> 01:09:21.619
* I see that you have
come so far *

01:09:21.661 --> 01:09:23.913

says it all.

01:09:23.955 --> 01:09:25.999
And there's no steals
or saves left.

01:09:26.041 --> 01:09:28.209
Gwen:
Lennon was one of our favorites.

01:09:28.251 --> 01:09:30.462
As coaches
we loved his singing,

01:09:30.503 --> 01:09:31.921
his unique style of voice.

01:09:31.963 --> 01:09:33.965
If there was gonna be anyone
that I brought back,

01:09:34.007 --> 01:09:35.717
I want to bring back,
like, a real artist

01:09:35.759 --> 01:09:38.053
that has a point of view,
that knows who they are.

01:09:38.094 --> 01:09:39.721
You know,
I always wanted Lennon,

01:09:39.763 --> 01:09:41.389
and now he's on my team.

01:09:41.431 --> 01:09:44.559
* I don't know you *

01:09:44.601 --> 01:09:46.394
* But I... *

01:09:46.436 --> 01:09:47.979
I'm singing "Falling Slowly"

01:09:48.021 --> 01:09:50.899
by Glen Hansard
and Markéta Irglová.

01:09:50.940 --> 01:09:53.276
This song really represents
what my journey

01:09:53.318 --> 01:09:54.569
has been on this show.

01:09:54.611 --> 01:09:56.112
As somebody that's the underdog

01:09:56.154 --> 01:09:57.947
and all the emotion
that comes from that,

01:09:57.989 --> 01:10:00.617
there just couldn't have been
a more perfect song.

01:10:00.658 --> 01:10:05.455
* Ahh, ahh, ahh *

01:10:05.497 --> 01:10:06.539
I love it.

01:10:06.581 --> 01:10:07.832
It's feeling good.
Yeah.

01:10:07.874 --> 01:10:10.502
One thing was just,
when you get to,

01:10:10.543 --> 01:10:12.212
"Well, you have suffered enough

01:10:12.253 --> 01:10:15.048
and you warred with yourself,
it's time that you won,"

01:10:15.090 --> 01:10:17.342
make sure that we can hear
the lyric.
Yeah.

01:10:17.384 --> 01:10:18.927
'Cause, like, right now
you're kind of...

01:10:18.968 --> 01:10:20.595
It's getting lost.
...falling off a little bit.

01:10:20.637 --> 01:10:22.389
It's just
such a great lyric.

01:10:22.430 --> 01:10:23.807
Yeah.
If you don't get it,

01:10:23.848 --> 01:10:25.433
then you're not gonna get
the story as much.

01:10:25.475 --> 01:10:27.435
Definitely got to make sure
that I get that, yep.
Yeah.

01:10:27.477 --> 01:10:28.561
I'm super excited.

01:10:28.603 --> 01:10:30.146
I think it sounds amazing.

01:10:30.188 --> 01:10:32.899
It feels like now
my team is, like,

01:10:32.941 --> 01:10:35.944
all over the map 'cause
I don't have anybody like you.

01:10:35.985 --> 01:10:37.487
Thank you for letting me
be here -- again.

01:10:37.529 --> 01:10:38.738
Yay!
If I haven't said that enough.

01:10:38.780 --> 01:10:40.740
Like, this is so fun.
[ Chuckles ] No.

01:10:40.782 --> 01:10:41.950
Lennon:
Gwen could have picked anyone,

01:10:41.991 --> 01:10:43.493
and she chose me to come back.

01:10:43.535 --> 01:10:45.954
So I feel a lot of pressure
in this performance.

01:10:45.995 --> 01:10:49.124
Because so many good people
didn't get this chance,

01:10:49.165 --> 01:10:50.834
I'm just gonna give it
everything I have

01:10:50.875 --> 01:10:53.420

to be there.

Hello, Lennon.

I am so glad
that Gwen chose you

01:13:19.524 --> 01:13:22.235
because what you did
in that knockout performance --

01:13:22.277 --> 01:13:24.696

you made John Legend cry.

the chance to come back

01:13:34.414 --> 01:13:36.791
and put in another stellar
performance on your part.

01:13:36.833 --> 01:13:40.378
You're just a proper artist,
and that's what I'm here for.

01:13:40.420 --> 01:13:42.005
Thank you, man.
Means the world.

01:13:42.047 --> 01:13:43.298
Means the world.
Thank you.

01:13:43.340 --> 01:13:44.883
John, what'd you think
about tonight?

01:13:44.924 --> 01:13:47.052
It was truly beautiful.

01:13:47.093 --> 01:13:49.054
You've just been, honestly,
very consistent.

01:13:49.095 --> 01:13:50.597
We can tell
who you want to be,

01:13:50.638 --> 01:13:52.891
and you're coming out here
and executing it on stage

01:13:52.932 --> 01:13:54.851
really beautifully
every single time.

01:13:54.893 --> 01:13:56.728
And you did it again.

01:13:56.770 --> 01:13:59.272
Thank you, John.
Reba.

01:13:59.314 --> 01:14:01.691
There's nobody like you
on this competition.

01:14:01.733 --> 01:14:03.318
And when I listen
to the radio,

01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:06.988
I like to be able to identify
the singer immediately.

01:14:07.030 --> 01:14:08.656
It's a little game
I play with myself.

01:14:08.698 --> 01:14:10.909
And when you start
recording your records,

01:14:10.950 --> 01:14:12.494
when you have
your own music out,

01:14:12.535 --> 01:14:14.662
I know that I will be able
to say,

01:14:14.704 --> 01:14:16.706
"I know who that is."

01:14:16.748 --> 01:14:18.166
Wow. Thank you.

01:14:18.208 --> 01:14:20.794
Alright, Coach,
this all comes down to you.

01:14:20.835 --> 01:14:23.713
I mean, I Super Saved you.

01:14:23.755 --> 01:14:25.006
You didn't let me down.

01:14:25.048 --> 01:14:26.424
The whole performance
was beautiful.

01:14:26.466 --> 01:14:28.510
I really liked getting
to know you in rehearsals

01:14:28.551 --> 01:14:31.179
and watching you work
your way through this song.

01:14:31.221 --> 01:14:33.181
Yeah.
You did just, again,

01:14:33.223 --> 01:14:36.309
an amazing, beautiful,
artistic performance.

01:14:36.351 --> 01:14:37.644
Really beautiful.
Thank you so much, Gwen.

01:14:37.686 --> 01:14:39.854
Thank you
for bringing me back.
Yes.

01:14:39.896 --> 01:14:41.856
Lennon --
he's coming in and doing

01:14:41.898 --> 01:14:44.776
a perfect song for his voice

01:14:44.818 --> 01:14:47.320
and doing
a perfect version of it.

01:14:47.362 --> 01:14:49.906
How do I compare
a singer-songwriter on my team

01:14:49.948 --> 01:14:51.866
to all these other genres?

01:14:51.908 --> 01:14:53.868
It is nearly impossible to do.

01:14:53.910 --> 01:14:56.079
Great job!
Thank you.

01:14:56.121 --> 01:14:57.622
I got one more performance
to see,

01:14:57.664 --> 01:14:59.082
and my stomach is in knots.

01:14:59.124 --> 01:15:02.127
I am agonizing.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

01:15:08.925 --> 01:15:10.260
* This is "The Voice" *

01:15:10.301 --> 01:15:12.137
Daly:
Welcome back to the playoffs.

01:15:12.178 --> 01:15:14.931
* Bah bah bah bah bah bah bah *

01:15:14.973 --> 01:15:16.599
That's my jam.

01:15:16.641 --> 01:15:18.393
I love SWV.

01:15:18.435 --> 01:15:20.478
* Bah bah bah bah
bah bah bah *

01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:22.647
* Bah dah dah *
* Bah dah dah *

01:15:22.689 --> 01:15:24.691
[ Cheers and applause ]
Taking me back.

01:15:24.733 --> 01:15:26.151
**

01:15:26.192 --> 01:15:28.028
Gwen: Kara --
she's one of those artists

01:15:28.069 --> 01:15:30.155
that, once she gets on stage
with the lights,

01:15:30.196 --> 01:15:31.948
the outfit, the audience,

01:15:31.990 --> 01:15:33.825
the real Kara comes out.

01:15:33.867 --> 01:15:36.453
During the knockouts,
you seized the moment.

01:15:36.494 --> 01:15:38.246
Just, like, add the lights
and the cameras,

01:15:38.288 --> 01:15:40.415
and you turn into
another version of yourself.

01:15:40.457 --> 01:15:42.042
I love to perform.
Yeah.

01:15:42.083 --> 01:15:43.460
It's just --
I'm so passionate about it.

01:15:43.501 --> 01:15:45.295
How are you feeling
about this song?

01:15:45.337 --> 01:15:47.464
This is one of my
favorite songs ever

01:15:47.505 --> 01:15:49.632
by one of my favorite groups
of all time.

01:15:49.674 --> 01:15:53.762
* Rain on me *

01:15:53.803 --> 01:15:57.766
I am singing "Rain" by SWV.

01:15:57.807 --> 01:15:59.142
* Rain down on me *

01:15:59.184 --> 01:16:00.477
I just love
everything about them.

01:16:00.518 --> 01:16:02.395
They're just three girls
from the neighborhood

01:16:02.437 --> 01:16:05.357
that just got together
and did big things.

01:16:05.398 --> 01:16:08.068
They just represent all
the young girls from the block,

01:16:08.109 --> 01:16:09.527
like, all the round-the-way
girls, you know,

01:16:09.569 --> 01:16:11.404
and I grew up
from round the way.

01:16:11.446 --> 01:16:14.783
So that's one thing
that I really appreciate.

01:16:14.824 --> 01:16:16.159
They have inspired me.

01:16:16.201 --> 01:16:18.453
Wow. That sounds so good
on your voice.

01:16:18.495 --> 01:16:19.996
Thank you.
But, like, that line,

01:16:20.038 --> 01:16:21.623
* Let your love just -- *

01:16:21.664 --> 01:16:23.833
It needs to be a little bit
more intentional and rhythmic.

01:16:23.875 --> 01:16:26.252
Okay.
* Let your love,
dun, dun, dun, dun *

01:16:26.294 --> 01:16:27.420
Yeah.
A little more like, "Mm!"

01:16:27.462 --> 01:16:28.588
You know what I mean?
Yeah.

01:16:28.630 --> 01:16:30.465
* Let your love just shower *

01:16:30.507 --> 01:16:34.219
Before I came here,
I was working as a caregiver

01:16:34.260 --> 01:16:37.180
for developmental disabled
and the elderly,

01:16:37.222 --> 01:16:38.515
doing gigs on the side,

01:16:38.556 --> 01:16:41.351
but still having to work
that 9-to-5.

01:16:41.393 --> 01:16:45.188
But to be here, like, sometimes
I have to pinch myself.

01:16:45.230 --> 01:16:46.523
Like, I always get
a little nervous

01:16:46.564 --> 01:16:48.441
in front of you because --
Me?!

01:16:48.483 --> 01:16:50.276
Yes!
You're Gwen Stefani. Like --
Oh, my gosh. No, I'm not!

01:16:50.318 --> 01:16:52.070
I'm supposed to be,
like, your safe zone,

01:16:52.112 --> 01:16:53.613
like your coach,
like your cheerleader.

01:16:53.655 --> 01:16:58.952
Yes, but I just have so much
respect and love for you.

01:16:58.993 --> 01:17:00.286
You're so good.

01:17:00.328 --> 01:17:01.746
You don't ever need
to be nervous around me.

01:17:01.788 --> 01:17:03.039
Thank you so much.

01:17:03.081 --> 01:17:04.290
Do you know what
you're wearing yet?

01:17:04.332 --> 01:17:05.542
Yeah. It's gonna be fly.
[ Laughs ]

01:17:05.583 --> 01:17:07.002
I think
you'll approve of it.

01:17:07.043 --> 01:17:09.754
You look so good every time.
Thank you.

01:17:09.796 --> 01:17:11.548
I can't even put into words

01:17:11.589 --> 01:17:14.217
how thankful I am
for this opportunity.

01:17:14.259 --> 01:17:15.802
I'm putting it out there
right now.

01:17:15.844 --> 01:17:17.345
You gonna see me in lives.

01:17:17.387 --> 01:17:18.847
I think you're doing it.
I'm not worried.

01:17:18.888 --> 01:17:20.390
Oh, thank you, Gwen!

01:17:20.432 --> 01:17:22.183
Gwen: Kara's definitely grown
every single round,

01:17:22.225 --> 01:17:24.060
and she keeps showing me,
like, a little bit more.

01:17:24.102 --> 01:17:26.187
This is, like, another
one of those hard decisions

01:17:26.229 --> 01:17:27.772
'cause I have
this amazing artist.

01:17:27.814 --> 01:17:31.067
I just don't even know
how I'm gonna choose.

01:17:31.109 --> 01:17:33.945
With "Rain,"
here's Kara Tenae.

that burns in me *

Oh, Kara, that was my favorite
performance you've done.

01:19:49.414 --> 01:19:50.874
It was so good.

01:19:50.915 --> 01:19:52.459
You never over-perform.

a song like that

Yeah.

But you always perform
the song

01:19:58.256 --> 01:19:59.632
like it's meant to be performed.

01:19:59.674 --> 01:20:01.384
That was really, really good.

so nostalgic.

I absolutely loved this song,

and it was so good
for your voice.

01:20:10.060 --> 01:20:11.603
You sounded magical.

01:20:11.644 --> 01:20:14.439
You just look like a star
on stage.

01:20:14.481 --> 01:20:16.900
And you control your movements

01:20:16.941 --> 01:20:19.569
in a way
that's so savvy and beautiful.

01:20:19.611 --> 01:20:21.905

of yours, as well.

This has been so fun
working with Kara

because she's really humble
and just eager to learn.

01:20:30.997 --> 01:20:33.917
Even vocally,
your voice has gotten warmer.

01:20:33.958 --> 01:20:35.710
You have, like,
a little bit of rasp.

01:20:35.752 --> 01:20:38.797
I don't think people understand
how hard it is

01:20:38.838 --> 01:20:41.424
to be that in control
of your voice

01:20:41.466 --> 01:20:43.551
and move on stage
at the same time.

01:20:43.593 --> 01:20:45.553
Yes.
And that is pro stuff.

01:20:45.595 --> 01:20:46.763

Real pro stuff.

only three of these artists

01:21:35.228 --> 01:21:38.773
can represent you
in our live shows in the Top 12.

01:21:38.815 --> 01:21:41.234
I just want to say
that you already won

01:21:41.276 --> 01:21:42.819
by doing what you've done.

01:21:42.861 --> 01:21:44.654
[ Cheers and applause ]
Let's go, guys.
Let's go, guys.

01:21:44.696 --> 01:21:46.573
But I have to choose
three people right now.

01:21:46.614 --> 01:21:47.991
Okay, I think
you're stalling now.

01:21:48.033 --> 01:21:50.827
And it's really hard.
[ Laughter ]

01:21:50.869 --> 01:21:51.786
You're so pushy.

01:21:51.828 --> 01:21:53.663
Don't pressure her,
Carson!

01:21:53.705 --> 01:21:55.874
It's my job.
[ Laughter ]

01:21:55.915 --> 01:21:58.293
Gwen, who is the
first artist moving on?

01:21:58.335 --> 01:22:01.713
**

01:22:01.755 --> 01:22:06.009
Alright, the first artist
moving on to the live shows...

01:22:06.051 --> 01:22:08.553
**

01:22:08.595 --> 01:22:10.013
...is Bias.

01:22:10.055 --> 01:22:13.683
Bias advancing to the
Top 12 for Team Gwen!

01:22:13.725 --> 01:22:16.978
I think that Bias is so
authentic and knows who he is.

01:22:17.020 --> 01:22:18.104
Thank you so much.

01:22:18.146 --> 01:22:19.606
He's an amazing singer.

01:22:19.647 --> 01:22:22.192
I think he's country
and country and country.

01:22:22.233 --> 01:22:25.070
Alright, Gwen, who is
the next artist moving on?

01:22:25.111 --> 01:22:27.447
**

01:22:27.489 --> 01:22:29.074
The next artist...
John: [ Chuckles ]

01:22:29.115 --> 01:22:32.035
...[chuckling] moving on --
[ Laughter ]

01:22:32.077 --> 01:22:35.121
It's, like, so stressful!

01:22:35.163 --> 01:22:37.916
The next artist
going to the live shows...

01:22:37.957 --> 01:22:40.835
**

01:22:40.877 --> 01:22:41.961
...is Kara.

01:22:42.003 --> 01:22:44.464
[ Cheers and applause ]
Yes, Kara!

01:22:44.506 --> 01:22:47.884
I picked Kara because she really
knows how to handle the stage.

01:22:47.926 --> 01:22:48.885
You're amazing.

01:22:48.927 --> 01:22:50.512
She knows what songs suit her.

01:22:50.553 --> 01:22:51.930
Yes, Kara!

01:22:51.971 --> 01:22:54.265
And she just seems
super ready for that moment.

01:22:54.307 --> 01:22:56.559
Ahh.
Well, and it's gonna
get harder here.

01:22:56.601 --> 01:22:58.061
We got four
just incredible artists.

01:22:58.103 --> 01:23:00.397
One more can move on
to fulfill the Top 12.

01:23:00.438 --> 01:23:02.857
The rest, unfortunately,
will leave "The Voice" tonight.

01:23:02.899 --> 01:23:05.443
Who is the last artist
moving on, Gwen?

01:23:05.485 --> 01:23:08.405
I love you guys so much.

01:23:08.446 --> 01:23:13.952
The third person moving on
to the live shows is...

01:23:15.495 --> 01:23:16.913
Tanner.

01:23:16.955 --> 01:23:19.082
[ Cheers and applause ]
Tanner, also stunned,

01:23:19.124 --> 01:23:21.001
moves on
to the live shows!

01:23:21.042 --> 01:23:24.170
Tanner has so much range,
and he has so much power.

01:23:24.212 --> 01:23:27.841
Being able to help him grow
as an artist is something

01:23:27.882 --> 01:23:29.884
that I just thrive off of.
Niall: Yes, Tanner!

01:23:29.926 --> 01:23:33.179
I had to put him into the lives
and see what he could do.

01:23:33.221 --> 01:23:35.181
Ladies and gentlemen,
how about a big hand...

01:23:35.223 --> 01:23:36.641
Ahh.
...for these three

01:23:36.683 --> 01:23:39.019
incredible artists
that are leaving us tonight?

01:23:39.060 --> 01:23:41.855
I think I have one of
the strongest live show teams.

01:23:41.896 --> 01:23:45.442
I have country. I have pop.
I have soul-R&B.

01:23:45.483 --> 01:23:47.318
Team Gwen is amazing.

01:23:47.360 --> 01:23:48.611
America, get ready.

01:23:48.653 --> 01:23:52.615
[ All cheering ]

01:23:52.657 --> 01:23:55.285
You know, we've seen
each of our coaches

01:23:55.326 --> 01:23:56.828
make some tough decisions.

01:23:56.870 --> 01:23:59.622
We've seen their teams
give some great performances.

01:23:59.664 --> 01:24:01.416
But you know what they say --

01:24:01.458 --> 01:24:04.753
you save the best for last.

01:24:04.794 --> 01:24:07.213
Team Legend is tomorrow night.

01:24:07.255 --> 01:24:16.973
**

01:24:17.015 --> 01:24:26.566

01:24:26.608 --> 01:24:36.576
