WEBVTT

00:00.320 --> 00:02.680
Wow, Hyde. I can't believe it.
Your own set of wheels.

00:02.752 --> 00:05.818
Yep. She is the best thing
that ever happened to me.

00:05.888 --> 00:08.757
Oh, except for that one time
Kelso swallowed that fishhook.

00:08.831 --> 00:11.962
[Chuckling]
That was pretty cool too.

00:12.031 --> 00:14.333
Yeah, that was one magic trick
I could never get right.

00:15.840 --> 00:18.393
All right, Hyde,
this car is fine...

00:18.464 --> 00:21.181
but, I mean,
it's no Vista Cruiser.

00:21.248 --> 00:23.103
How many miles
you gettin' to the gallon?

00:23.168 --> 00:26.168
- Oh, about 11.
- Damn! Okay, fine.

00:26.240 --> 00:29.371
But, you know,
the Vista Cruiser can seat eight-

00:29.440 --> 00:31.295
nine if someone
sits on the stain.

00:32.607 --> 00:34.462
Yeah, okay, Forman,
but do you have any idea...

00:34.528 --> 00:37.342
how many chicks
I can fit in the flatbed?

00:37.408 --> 00:39.350
Thirty-two.
And that's with Big Rhonda.

00:41.631 --> 00:43.289
Damn!

00:43.359 --> 00:45.367
[Gasps]
Eww!

00:49.344 --> 00:51.711
Oh, hello.

00:51.775 --> 00:53.630
What are you doing
back there, Fez?

00:53.695 --> 00:55.582
L- I was-

00:55.648 --> 00:58.844
I was just showing Caroline
the back of my new car and my tongue.

01:00.415 --> 01:02.619
Fez, this isn't your car.

01:02.687 --> 01:05.786
Yeah. Foreigners can't
drive here unless it's a cab.

01:08.640 --> 01:10.680
Shut up.

01:10.752 --> 01:14.810
Isn't he cute? Fezzie, I told you.
You don't have to try and impress me anymore.

01:14.879 --> 01:16.734
I'm your girlfriend now.

01:16.799 --> 01:19.734
I'm sorry, Caroline.
From now on, I will be totally honest.

01:19.808 --> 01:22.263
- Good. Now, come on, walk me home.
- Ah, yes.

01:22.336 --> 01:25.369
And on the way, I can tell you
about the time I killed a shark with a coconut.

01:27.840 --> 01:29.695
[Clears Throat]

01:29.760 --> 01:33.688
All right, Kelso, let's go out cruising
for hot chicks with self-esteem problems.

01:35.647 --> 01:37.949
Yeah. No, thanks, man.
I don't do that stuff anymore.

01:38.015 --> 01:40.252
Shut up and come on.

01:40.320 --> 01:42.621
No, man, I mean it.
I've matured.

01:44.416 --> 01:46.271
Hey, Donna,
wanna go to the mall?

01:46.336 --> 01:49.685
Rerun from What's HaPPening is
opening up the new Dairy Queen.

01:51.072 --> 01:54.268
Actually, Jackie,
as fun as that sounds, um, no.

01:56.159 --> 01:59.640
What? "Hey, hey, hey."

01:59.712 --> 02:01.883
- I'm in.
- Okay.

02:01.952 --> 02:04.123
Well, let me get my beret
and some Certs with Retsyn.

02:05.472 --> 02:07.326
Cool.

02:07.392 --> 02:11.254
Wait a second. You're too mature to go cruising
with me, but you go to the mall with Jackie?

02:11.327 --> 02:14.077
Yeah. It's this new thing we're trying, man.
We're friends.

02:14.143 --> 02:18.650
See, I did some reflecting, and I realized
thatJackie is the only girl I want to be with.

02:19.776 --> 02:22.558
Today?

02:22.623 --> 02:24.827
No, every day.

02:24.895 --> 02:29.019
See, we were meant to be together.
She just doesn't know it yet.

02:29.087 --> 02:31.323
Yeah, but I have a plan.

02:31.391 --> 02:34.653
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yeah.

02:34.719 --> 02:37.469
See, she wants to be
just friends, right?

02:37.535 --> 02:41.975
Okay, so I'll be her friend.
But what she doesn't realize is that I'm also a boy.

02:43.903 --> 02:48.857
Yeah, and sooner or later,
friend is gonna lead down the path to boy.

02:48.928 --> 02:51.294
And then
I'll be her friend-boy.

02:52.607 --> 02:54.462
That is a great plan.

02:55.967 --> 02:57.974
- Okay, I'm ready.
- Hey. Let's go, friend.

02:58.047 --> 02:59.902
Okay.

03:02.239 --> 03:05.054
That is such a bad plan.

03:05.119 --> 03:07.126
Yeah, but, you know,
on the bright side...

03:07.199 --> 03:10.941
maybe we'll be there
when it all blows up in his face.

03:13.888 --> 03:16.506
Hangin'out

03:17.728 --> 03:19.582
Down the street

03:21.376 --> 03:23.230
The same old thing

03:24.991 --> 03:26.846
We did last week

03:28.063 --> 03:32.406
Not a thing to do

03:32.479 --> 03:35.741
But talk to you

03:35.807 --> 03:37.466
We're all all right

03:37.536 --> 03:39.324
We're all all right

03:39.391 --> 03:42.009
Hello, Wisconsin.!

03:50.719 --> 03:53.108
Hey, Mrs. Forman.
Happy birthday.

03:54.880 --> 03:56.854
Ohh.

03:57.856 --> 03:59.743
I can't believe
you remembered.

03:59.807 --> 04:02.939
You are the first person
to say anything all day.

04:06.783 --> 04:10.712
And how did you know
I needed more flashbulbs?

04:10.784 --> 04:12.638
Thank you.

04:14.463 --> 04:16.601
- So, do you wanna stay for dinner?
- Oh, no, thanks.

04:16.671 --> 04:18.973
- I'm just gonna grab a sandwich.
- A sandwich!

04:19.039 --> 04:22.137
Steven, a sandwich is a sandwich,
but a Manwich is a meal.

04:23.520 --> 04:26.302
- Oh, well, thanks, Mrs. Forman.
- Uh-huh.

04:27.679 --> 04:30.908
Hey, Mom, what's for dinner?
I'm starving.

04:30.975 --> 04:34.488
- Manwiches.
- Again?

04:34.559 --> 04:36.948
Ahh, we just had those.

04:37.023 --> 04:39.838
Kitty, I left my shirt on the bed.
It needs to be ironed for tomorrow.

04:39.903 --> 04:42.936
- Okay.
- Oh, and, uh...

04:43.007 --> 04:46.619
I know you think I forgot,
but I didn't.

04:46.687 --> 04:50.582
[Chuckling]
Oh, Red, I knew you'd remember.

04:50.656 --> 04:53.655
Yep, the check for the plumber
is on the dresser.

04:55.487 --> 04:57.342
Oh.

04:58.623 --> 05:00.990
Good.

05:02.528 --> 05:05.048
Um...

05:05.119 --> 05:06.974
is there
anything else to eat?

05:09.887 --> 05:12.124
Well, you know what, honey?

05:14.495 --> 05:17.529
I don't give a good gosh darn
what you eat!

05:25.631 --> 05:28.380
Wow, she's really upset.

05:28.448 --> 05:31.677
Yeah. Nice goin'.

05:33.248 --> 05:36.892
See, the boatneck adds
dimension to your shoulders.

05:36.959 --> 05:39.806
And the plum color-
that really accents your jewel-toned eyes.

05:42.623 --> 05:46.103
Oh, my God.
Michael, you just described my perfect outfit.

05:46.175 --> 05:48.085
You are so good at this.

05:48.160 --> 05:51.258
Yeah, I have
a knack for ensembles.

05:54.239 --> 05:57.174
Hey, Hyde, how goes
the cruising for chicks?

05:57.248 --> 06:01.044
It was going fine till I hit a patch of ice
and almost took out a few of'em.

06:01.119 --> 06:02.974
Big Rhonda cracked
my brake light.

06:07.456 --> 06:09.692
[Sighs]
Hi.

06:09.759 --> 06:12.345
- Hey.
- Have you seen Fez?

06:12.415 --> 06:15.797
Uh, no. He went bowling
with his host parents.

06:15.871 --> 06:19.220
Damn him!
I'm sorry.

06:19.295 --> 06:21.978
I was just hoping he'd be here
so we could study together.

06:22.047 --> 06:24.120
Now I have to
walk home alone in the dark.

06:24.191 --> 06:26.646
It's scary out there.
Somebody ran over Big Rhonda.

06:29.631 --> 06:32.446
- Um, do you want a-
- Okay!

06:32.511 --> 06:34.650
Ride?

06:34.719 --> 06:37.948
You know, Michael,
I'm really enjoying our time together.

06:38.015 --> 06:39.925
Really?
Me too.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.163
Yeah, you know, the makeup, shopping,
braiding each other's hair-

06:43.232 --> 06:46.461
- you are like the girlfriend I never had.
- Oh.

06:46.527 --> 06:50.204
Well, thanks, Jackie.
L-Wait.

06:50.271 --> 06:52.126
- Girlfriend?
- [Giggles]

06:52.191 --> 06:54.046
Yeah. I mean,
Donna's nice and everything...

06:54.111 --> 06:56.599
but she kinda dresses
like a trucker.

07:01.472 --> 07:04.025
[TV]

07:06.079 --> 07:07.934
The Waltons.

07:09.055 --> 07:11.324
Now, there's
a grateful family.

07:12.671 --> 07:14.264
Mmm.

07:16.991 --> 07:19.642
And, boy, did they
love their mother.

07:22.815 --> 07:25.117
Oh, great.

07:25.183 --> 07:27.255
I think
I've got athlete's foot.

07:32.639 --> 07:34.527
I am- l-
I am going to bed.

07:40.575 --> 07:42.648
Where'd your mother go?

07:43.712 --> 07:45.566
To bed.

07:45.631 --> 07:47.486
Man, what's wrong
with her anyway?

07:47.551 --> 07:50.967
Oh, who knows?
She's been moody all day.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.203
Let me see the TVGuide.

07:54.271 --> 07:56.279
Ahh. Let's see.
What day is it?

07:57.311 --> 08:00.507
Ah, it's the 13th.

08:00.575 --> 08:03.477
It seems to me I was supposed
to do something on the 13th.

08:04.959 --> 08:07.348
Oh, good Lord!

08:09.055 --> 08:11.477
You forgot
your mother's birthday!

08:14.911 --> 08:18.523
Oh, no. Dad, this is bad.
This is very, very bad.

08:18.591 --> 08:21.525
All right.
Don't start gettin' all twitchy.

08:23.615 --> 08:25.917
Now, we gotta think.

08:28.895 --> 08:30.837
Let's watch CHiPs and think.

08:34.847 --> 08:37.660
[Radio: Rock, Faint]

08:37.727 --> 08:40.443
So, Fez is really nice, huh?

08:40.510 --> 08:43.260
- Yeah, Fez is a good guy.
- Yeah.

08:44.575 --> 08:46.909
You know, sometimes, when I'm
trying to sleep at night...

08:46.975 --> 08:50.138
I think about how much
it would hurt if he ever left me.

08:50.207 --> 08:52.061
And then I say,
"Fez would never leave me."

08:52.127 --> 08:55.607
But then I say, "We've only been going out
for a short time. Maybe he would leave me."

08:57.631 --> 09:01.406
So then, I hold my breath
until my lungs are about to explode...

09:01.471 --> 09:04.286
because that's how much
I think it would hurt if he ever did leave me.

09:10.655 --> 09:13.208
And then,
when I regain consciousness...

09:14.975 --> 09:17.528
I start breathing again,
and everything's fine.

09:17.599 --> 09:19.737
Oops. There's my house.
Thanks! Bye!

09:22.399 --> 09:24.406
- See ya.
- [Door Closes]

09:29.727 --> 09:32.891
[Together]
Happy birthday!

09:35.743 --> 09:37.598
Oh, you remembered?

09:37.663 --> 09:41.460
Well, of course
we remembered, honey.

09:41.535 --> 09:44.764
We just figured that we'd wait
till there was only 15 minutes left in the day...

09:44.831 --> 09:46.685
and you were good and mad...

09:46.751 --> 09:50.198
and then we'd sneak up here
and surprise the hell out of you.

09:50.271 --> 09:52.606
Wow, what a good plan.

09:52.671 --> 09:55.540
'Cause I was awfully mad.

09:55.615 --> 09:58.462
Yeah. We really
had you going.

10:00.095 --> 10:02.004
Here, Mom.
Open this one first.

10:02.079 --> 10:04.468
- It's from me.
- Well, thank you, honey.

10:10.239 --> 10:13.174
Oh, a map of Wisconsin.

10:14.686 --> 10:17.436
Oh, well,
thank you.

10:17.503 --> 10:21.148
And, Mom, I got you
these balloons too.

10:21.215 --> 10:23.735
[Chuckling]

10:23.807 --> 10:27.189
"Knock out the knock-knocks
at Schiffy's Gas-N-Go."

10:28.255 --> 10:30.110
Huh.

10:30.175 --> 10:32.084
Wait, Kitty,
there's more!

10:34.000 --> 10:40.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:45.983 --> 10:47.838
A funnel.

10:47.903 --> 10:51.067
'Cause I know how much
you like to pour things.

10:54.175 --> 10:59.096
Well, um, either these gifts
are really thoughtful...

10:59.167 --> 11:02.745
or you bought a bunch of crap
at the gas station!

11:02.815 --> 11:06.841
- What?
- Oh, admit it, Red Forman.
You forgot my birthday.

11:06.911 --> 11:09.082
- [Sighs]
- Quick, Dad, give her the lighter.

11:12.639 --> 11:14.581
Look, Kitty, I'm sorry.

11:14.655 --> 11:16.510
But it's just-

11:17.759 --> 11:20.409
Well, marking the calendar
is your responsibility.

11:20.479 --> 11:22.780
[Eric]
Oh.

11:22.846 --> 11:25.629
Dad, no.

11:37.663 --> 11:40.084
Ah, good morning, sunshine.

11:40.159 --> 11:42.264
So, what's for breakfast?

11:42.335 --> 11:44.190
A funnel.

11:46.047 --> 11:47.901
Ow.

11:49.726 --> 11:52.509
What the heck makes Jackie think
I'm her girlfriend?

11:53.695 --> 11:56.248
All I did was pick out
a few of her outfits...

11:56.319 --> 11:58.839
paint her nails
and give her a facial.

11:59.871 --> 12:01.726
Gee, I don't know, Denise.

12:02.943 --> 12:04.798
Um, guys, can we go inside?

12:04.863 --> 12:07.197
I'm freezing
my choo-choos off.

12:07.262 --> 12:10.611
No way.
I'm not going in there.

12:10.687 --> 12:12.542
I forgot my mom's birthday.

12:12.607 --> 12:16.317
Really? 'Cause I remembered
your mom's birthday.

12:16.383 --> 12:19.928
- If you remembered, why didn't you tell me?
- How would that be funny?

12:23.486 --> 12:26.007
I don't ever have to worry
about forgetting Caroline's birthday.

12:26.079 --> 12:28.926
She wrote it on my arm
with permanent marker.

12:30.271 --> 12:33.532
- Isn't she sweet?
- More like psycho.

12:33.599 --> 12:35.988
What are you doing
calling my girlfriend psycho?

12:36.062 --> 12:38.397
I'm sorry, Fez,
did I say psycho?

12:38.463 --> 12:41.725
I meant nut bag,
head case, wackadoo.

12:41.791 --> 12:44.344
She chokes herself, man.

12:45.727 --> 12:48.247
Well, Hyde, maybe-
maybe you should-

12:48.319 --> 12:50.807
maybe you should
choke yourself!

12:52.191 --> 12:54.045
Good day.

12:54.111 --> 12:56.085
- Fez-
- I said good day!

12:59.679 --> 13:01.948
Man, what fun is it
being a girlfriend...

13:02.015 --> 13:04.349
if you don't even have
your own boobs to play with?

13:12.575 --> 13:14.942
So what, Kelso?
So you're her girlfriend.

13:15.007 --> 13:17.942
What could possibly be
so bad about that?

13:18.015 --> 13:20.884
L-I'll tell you
what could be so bad.

13:20.959 --> 13:24.504
Oh, Michael, this is
the happiest day of my life.

13:35.838 --> 13:38.173
Thank you so much
for being my maid of honor.

13:38.239 --> 13:40.694
That's what girlfriends do.

13:40.767 --> 13:42.622
I'm just honored you asked me.

13:47.006 --> 13:48.861
Yeah, but...

13:48.926 --> 13:52.155
you know, on the flip side, try to think
about your life withoutJackie at all.

13:57.087 --> 13:59.956
[Water DriPPing]

14:18.271 --> 14:21.021
Wow. That's even worse.

14:22.751 --> 14:25.882
Hey, girlfriends sometimes
make out together, right?

14:28.255 --> 14:32.761
Yeah, usually right after
long, sweaty pillow fights.

14:32.830 --> 14:35.448
Yeah, man, it happens
all the time.

14:35.518 --> 14:38.175
All right!

14:42.847 --> 14:45.116
Hey, Mrs. Forman.

14:46.207 --> 14:49.054
- Is Eric home?
- Eric?

14:49.119 --> 14:52.861
Oh, you mean my son,
the map giver.

14:52.927 --> 14:54.999
I don't know,
and I don't care.

14:56.415 --> 15:00.092
- Mrs. Forman, are you okay?
- Oh, I am just freakin' fine!

15:03.550 --> 15:06.168
What happened?

15:06.238 --> 15:08.660
Well, you know
I love my family.

15:08.735 --> 15:13.143
It's just sometimes I want to
get in the car and run 'em all over.

15:14.847 --> 15:16.702
They forgot my birthday.

15:16.767 --> 15:19.156
I'm gonna go kick Eric's ass right now!

15:19.231 --> 15:21.849
No. I mean, it's one thing
when they don't notice...

15:21.919 --> 15:24.472
when I get my hair done differently-
which they don't-

15:24.543 --> 15:27.674
but this is my birthday.

15:27.742 --> 15:29.684
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe I expect too much.

15:29.759 --> 15:32.541
No, Mrs. Forman,
you have every right to be mad.

15:32.606 --> 15:36.119
In fact, you should be madder.
You're, like, the best mom in the world.

15:36.190 --> 15:38.427
Yeah!

15:38.495 --> 15:40.350
Thank you, Donna.

15:40.415 --> 15:43.317
I just wish my own family
would say that once in a while.

15:43.391 --> 15:45.300
[Sighs]

15:48.126 --> 15:50.363
Oh, sweetie, that's not
your breakfast, is it?

15:51.390 --> 15:55.383
- Yeah.
- Oh. [Chuckles]

15:55.454 --> 15:58.488
Why don't you just let me
make you some nice waffles instead?

15:58.559 --> 16:00.501
Oh, cool.
I love frozen waffles.

16:00.575 --> 16:03.957
Oh, honey.
No, no, no, no.

16:04.030 --> 16:06.365
I make my waffles
from scratch.

16:08.255 --> 16:10.110
Those bastards!

16:13.374 --> 16:15.229
Now, would you
look at her boobs?

16:15.294 --> 16:17.149
I am.

16:18.559 --> 16:21.014
And it's-
it's disgusting.

16:21.087 --> 16:24.764
I mean, what is she thinking,
packing in those sweet melons like that?

16:26.047 --> 16:27.902
I can't even
look away.

16:29.950 --> 16:33.212
You know, Michael, I have to say,
I'm really enjoying our new friendship together.

16:33.278 --> 16:35.612
- I love spending time with you.
- Me too.

16:35.679 --> 16:38.067
Do you wanna go to your house
and have a nice, sweaty pillow fight?

16:38.142 --> 16:39.997
[Gasps]
Okay.

16:48.094 --> 16:50.964
- Hello, Caroline.
- Oh, hi, Fez.

16:51.039 --> 16:53.460
So, hey, listen,
just, uh-just curious...

16:53.535 --> 16:55.390
um...

16:56.767 --> 16:59.069
do you sometimes
choke yourself?

16:59.135 --> 17:03.990
Yeah. But I only do it because
I love you more than anything in the world.

17:05.470 --> 17:07.477
Okay, I'm good
with that.

17:07.550 --> 17:09.492
I'll get you
a soda, lover.

17:09.566 --> 17:11.573
Don't forget to breathe
while I'm gone.

17:14.270 --> 17:17.204
Hey, so how's it going
with "Mental Mary"?

17:18.686 --> 17:20.540
I owe you
an apology, Hyde.

17:20.607 --> 17:22.843
She is crazy.

17:22.910 --> 17:25.049
But she's crazy for me.

17:26.078 --> 17:28.761
[Gasping]

17:29.790 --> 17:31.896
[Sighs]

17:31.966 --> 17:33.821
[No Audible Dialogue]

17:35.967 --> 17:38.814
Yeah. Oh!
Here she comes.

17:55.230 --> 17:57.848
Oh, my God.
She didn't even look at us.

17:57.918 --> 18:00.918
- [Sighs]
- I don't think I've ever
seen Mom so mad. Have you?

18:00.990 --> 18:03.575
- Not since she stopped drinking.
- What?

18:06.142 --> 18:08.117
Nothing.
[Clears Throat]

18:08.190 --> 18:11.802
Look, obviously your mother's
very upset about something.

18:11.870 --> 18:14.772
And desperate times
call for desperate measures.

18:14.846 --> 18:16.701
For the last 10 years...

18:16.766 --> 18:19.319
she's been asking us
to do something...

18:19.390 --> 18:21.910
and every time we say no.

18:21.982 --> 18:25.877
Because what she wants
is the most horrible thing in the world.

18:28.415 --> 18:30.487
I won't do it.

18:31.966 --> 18:34.038
Oh, you will do it.

18:34.110 --> 18:37.656
And you will like it!

18:37.726 --> 18:40.726
Need a partner
Turn the partner by the right hand round

18:44.350 --> 18:47.612
I can't believe
we're finally square dancing.

18:47.678 --> 18:50.329
Oh, this is so much fun.

18:59.166 --> 19:01.370
It looks like
"Hee-Haw" puked in here.

19:02.367 --> 19:04.505
Come on, honey,
let's dance.

19:06.750 --> 19:09.718
Oh, my God.
This is awful.

19:09.790 --> 19:12.278
She made me waffles.
Now promenade, you son of a bitch!

19:13.439 --> 19:16.122
[Continues]

19:16.190 --> 19:17.783
Bow to your partner
corners, all

19:17.854 --> 19:19.545
Circle to the left
go around that hall

19:19.614 --> 19:21.370
Circle to the left
all around you go

19:21.438 --> 19:22.998
When you're there and then

19:23.070 --> 19:24.729
Do an allemande left
with the corner maid

19:24.799 --> 19:26.653
Do-si-do with
a partner there

19:26.719 --> 19:28.409
Then start by the left
in the middle

19:28.478 --> 19:31.413
Go all the way around
and then pick up your partner
with an arm around

19:31.486 --> 19:33.690
Start a Promenade
and go around that town

19:33.758 --> 19:36.092
Then when you're there, ladies
you backtrack

19:36.158 --> 19:37.653
Go the other way around

19:37.726 --> 19:39.930
Meet a Partner
Turn the Partner by the right hand round

19:39.998 --> 19:41.886
And back to the corner
for an allemande left

19:41.950 --> 19:43.892
Buck right in
for right and left grand

19:43.966 --> 19:46.333
Whoo-hee

19:48.222 --> 19:52.019
So, Mom, we found this present
we just had to get you.

19:52.095 --> 19:54.069
So, happy birthday.

19:54.142 --> 19:58.168
Ohh. I thought square dance night
was my present.

19:58.238 --> 20:02.330
It is. But we really
messed up this year.

20:02.399 --> 20:05.082
- Well, we're sorry.
- [Clicks Tongue] Ohh.

20:05.150 --> 20:07.190
[Chuckles]

20:11.295 --> 20:13.237
"World's Darn Tootin'est Mom."

20:15.774 --> 20:17.629
Do you really think so?

20:17.694 --> 20:19.517
You're darn tootin'.

20:24.670 --> 20:27.126
Okay. Well-
[Clears Throat]

20:27.198 --> 20:29.271
I think I've had
enough do-si-dos for one night.

20:29.342 --> 20:33.084
So, what do you say
we all go home and have hot fudge sundaes?

20:33.150 --> 20:34.874
- Oh, yes.
- Thank God.

20:34.942 --> 20:37.211
Bastards.

20:42.526 --> 20:44.217
- Valentine's Day.
- Check.

20:45.534 --> 20:48.185
- Anniversary.
- Check.

20:48.254 --> 20:50.643
- Mother's Day.
- Check.

20:50.718 --> 20:53.369
Well, I think
we got 'em all.

20:53.438 --> 20:56.754
Uh, Dad, we forgot
her birthday again.

20:56.830 --> 21:00.179
Damn it, Eric,
pay attention!

21:01.694 --> 21:03.963
[Sighs]
Valentine's Day.

21:04.030 --> 21:06.103
Check.

21:06.174 --> 21:09.305
- Anniversary.
- Check.

21:09.374 --> 21:11.229
- Mother's Day.
- Check.
