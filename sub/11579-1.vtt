00:02.991 --> 00:04.057
In the criminal justice system,

00:04.057 --> 00:07.776
sexually-based offenses
are considered especially heinous

00:07.776 --> 00:09.025
In New York City,

00:09.025 --> 00:12.717
the dedicated detectives who investigate
these vicious felonies are members

00:12.717 --> 00:15.563
of an elite squad known
as The Special Victims Unit.

00:15.563 --> 00:17.534
These are their stories.

00:34.054 --> 00:35.867
Can I help you?

00:38.247 --> 00:40.972
I want to report a rape.

00:41.453 --> 00:44.138
Okay. Let's go
someplace private, huh?

00:45.872 --> 00:48.475
Can you tell me what happened?

00:52.359 --> 00:56.988
It's okay, Megan.
I'm just here to help.

01:00.649 --> 01:04.369
He followed me
to my apartment last night.

01:05.046 --> 01:08.052
I don't know how
he got in the building,

01:08.052 --> 01:12.146
but when I opened my door
he pushed his way in.

01:15.175 --> 01:18.617
And then what happened?

01:19.541 --> 01:21.239
Megan?

01:22.543 --> 01:26.085
I told him to leave

01:26.085 --> 01:29.625
and that I never wanted
to see him again,

01:30.149 --> 01:32.739
but he slammed the door.

01:34.592 --> 01:36.702
Oh, God.

01:38.002 --> 01:40.846
Can you tell me who did this to you?

01:43.414 --> 01:46.689
Megan, is it your boyfriend?

01:50.002 --> 01:52.625
He's my father.

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON NBC: 2001/09/28

02:44.908 --> 02:48.353
It started when I was
in the first grade.

02:48.811 --> 02:52.804
Stroking, touching.

02:54.048 --> 02:58.503
He'd help me undress for bed,
and sometimes he'd take off his shirt

02:58.503 --> 03:01.218
and then his pants.

03:01.760 --> 03:07.754
When I was 12,
he put himself...

03:09.431 --> 03:11.530
Take your time.

03:13.321 --> 03:16.497
He told me not to cry.

03:17.965 --> 03:21.278
He'd show me these horrible pictures.

03:21.278 --> 03:24.762
He said that that was how
daddies loved their little girls.

03:24.762 --> 03:27.199
And this has been
going on ever since?

03:27.199 --> 03:29.889
No, he stopped
after I got my period.

03:29.889 --> 03:34.955
- How long ago was that?
- When I was 14.

03:39.497 --> 03:42.994
Did anything sexual happen last night?

03:42.994 --> 03:46.753
No, but we had a horrible fight.

03:46.753 --> 03:49.890
If he didn't have to catch a plane,
who knows what he would have done?

03:49.890 --> 03:52.550
I'm not going to lie to you, Megan.

03:52.550 --> 03:55.917
It's going to be very difficult to prove
a four-year-old rape.

03:55.917 --> 03:58.090
And we can't charge him
for the earlier abuse

03:58.090 --> 04:02.639
because the statute of limitation
only extends back five years.

04:02.639 --> 04:05.131
What about Lily?

04:05.932 --> 04:07.945
Who's Lily?

04:07.945 --> 04:10.753
My little sister.
She's seven.

04:10.753 --> 04:13.996
That's the same age I was
when he started molesting me.

04:13.996 --> 04:17.452
Well, did you see him
do anything to her?

04:18.300 --> 04:23.033
Yesterday afternoon I went to
my parents' to do my laundry,

04:23.033 --> 04:25.886
and I walked in on them.

04:25.886 --> 04:28.548
And what did you see?

04:31.704 --> 04:35.539
He was touching her
just like he used to touch me.

04:37.262 --> 04:39.501
Hey, Captain, we got some background
on Megan's father.

04:39.501 --> 04:42.189
I'm on my way to the Mayor's luncheon,
so let's make this quick.

04:42.189 --> 04:45.002
Okay. Evan Ramsey runs
Southerland Pharmaceuticals,

04:45.002 --> 04:48.258
and he just donated a wing
to the East Harlem Children's Hospital.

04:48.258 --> 04:49.836
Well, if his daughter's telling the truth,

04:49.836 --> 04:51.672
they're not gonna be hanging
his picture on their wall.

04:51.672 --> 04:53.502
Rebecca Southerland is the wife.

04:53.502 --> 04:55.393
She's also the daughter of
the company's founding father.

04:55.393 --> 04:58.483
So he married into the social register.
Any other kids?

04:58.483 --> 05:00.721
Yeah, two. Jody, 15,
and Lily, seven.

05:00.721 --> 05:02.905
Lily is the one that Megan says
he's molesting.

05:02.905 --> 05:05.238
So, basically,
we're working two cases here.

05:05.238 --> 05:07.464
A rape just this side
of the statute of limitations,

05:07.464 --> 05:09.762
and the possible molestation
of a seven-year-old.

05:09.762 --> 05:11.474
Munch and Fin are checking
with Children's Services

05:11.474 --> 05:13.094
to see if the family's
got any priors.

05:13.094 --> 05:14.692
Well, where is the mother in all this?

05:14.692 --> 05:16.678
She and Megan aren't
on speaking terms.

05:16.678 --> 05:18.030
We're off to see the mother right now.

05:18.030 --> 05:21.111
Good. Get back to me when you
have something to talk about.

05:21.750 --> 05:25.711
I've been married to Evan for 19 years,
had three children with him.

05:25.711 --> 05:28.050
I'd certainly know
if he was raping one of them.

05:28.050 --> 05:30.286
You've always had a blind spot
where he's concerned.

05:30.286 --> 05:31.904
Dad, please.

05:31.904 --> 05:35.182
Megan's lashing out.
She's a very angry young woman.

05:35.182 --> 05:38.266
Where do you think
all this anger came from?

05:38.266 --> 05:40.321
From that therapist
she's been seeing.

05:40.321 --> 05:42.793
- What therapist?
- Dr. Wharton.

05:42.793 --> 05:45.530
Megan started seeing her
when she went to Columbia.

05:45.530 --> 05:47.547
Since then, my daughter's
become an expert

05:47.547 --> 05:51.470
on what she calls
"our family dysfunction."

05:51.470 --> 05:55.179
I've tried talking to her,
but she just shuts me out.

05:55.179 --> 05:56.795
We've seen these
kind of cases before,

05:56.795 --> 06:01.378
and it's very difficult for daughters
to share this with their mothers.

06:01.378 --> 06:05.417
It isn't the first time she's made up
little stories to get attention.

06:05.417 --> 06:07.847
Has she ever
made up anything like this?

06:07.847 --> 06:09.935
Nothing this outlandish,

06:09.935 --> 06:15.149
but she has stretched the bounds of
reality to get what she wanted.

06:15.149 --> 06:17.952
God knows what she's been
telling that therapist.

06:17.952 --> 06:20.798
We're going to need to
speak with Jody and Lily.

06:20.798 --> 06:22.963
I don't see why that's necessary.

06:22.963 --> 06:25.263
It's routine. Whenever allegations
like these are made,

06:25.263 --> 06:27.927
we'd like to talk to everyone
in the family.

06:27.927 --> 06:31.193
Now she's putting her sisters
into the middle of her little drama.

06:31.193 --> 06:32.894
When can we talk to them?

06:32.894 --> 06:35.739
- They're in school.
- Where?

06:35.739 --> 06:38.817
I'll not have you embarrass them
in front of their friends.

06:38.817 --> 06:41.354
Then bring them down
to our precinct after school.

06:41.354 --> 06:45.475
The sooner we can talk to them,
the sooner we can close this up.

06:46.095 --> 06:48.531
They'll be there.

06:50.617 --> 06:53.269
Whole Life Recovery Center
92 West 78th Street
Tuesday, February 13

06:53.269 --> 06:58.026
Megan came to me suffering
from bulimia and depression.

06:58.026 --> 07:00.319
What was she depressed about?

07:02.614 --> 07:07.324
Eating disorders often signal
a deeper emotional trauma.

07:07.324 --> 07:10.282
In Megan's case,
it was childhood incest.

07:10.282 --> 07:13.438
- When did Megan tell you this?
- Only recently.

07:13.438 --> 07:16.289
She built a wall between
herself and her father,

07:16.289 --> 07:21.301
but after months of hard work
the floodgates finally opened

07:21.301 --> 07:22.789
and the truth came out.

07:22.789 --> 07:24.528
Why didn't you report the abuse?

07:24.528 --> 07:27.488
Megan's an adult. I couldn't
break confidentiality.

07:27.488 --> 07:31.303
The only reason I'm talking to you is
because she gave me permission.

07:31.303 --> 07:33.353
What about her younger sisters?

07:33.353 --> 07:37.754
I repeatedly asked her if she
thought they were at risk,

07:37.754 --> 07:42.209
and she always said no,
until yesterday.

07:42.548 --> 07:48.233
She called and she said that
she'd reported her father for abusing Lily.

07:48.976 --> 07:54.511
Is Megan emotionally ready
for the strain of a police investigation?

07:54.511 --> 08:00.166
She's still healing,
but she came to you,

08:00.166 --> 08:04.858
so that tells me she's
on the road to recovery.

08:05.353 --> 08:07.895
I had to go to the basement
to dig up this file.

08:07.895 --> 08:09.206
How long has it been there?

08:09.206 --> 08:11.838
Seven years,
when Megan Ramsey was 11.

08:11.838 --> 08:13.230
Who reported it?

08:13.230 --> 08:16.418
A resident in the emergency
room at Mercy General.

08:16.418 --> 08:20.138
Her mother brought her in for vaginal
bleeding after a bicycle accident.

08:20.138 --> 08:22.806
Megan told them she'd been
having trouble urinating,

08:22.806 --> 08:25.682
and when he noticed bruising
on her backside, he called.

08:25.682 --> 08:27.569
Your investigation
turn up anything?

08:27.569 --> 08:31.294
Megan said she got the bruises
riding horses at her grandfather's farm.

08:31.294 --> 08:33.124
What about the other problem?

08:33.124 --> 08:34.792
We contacted her pediatrician.

08:34.792 --> 08:37.788
He told us Megan had
a minor urinary tract infection

08:37.788 --> 08:39.918
from taking too many bubble baths.

08:39.918 --> 08:43.489
After a series of follow-up visits,
the case was closed.

08:43.489 --> 08:44.954
Thank you.

08:45.253 --> 08:47.952
Our complaining witness appears to
have a history of emotional problems.

08:47.952 --> 08:49.157
She's an incest victim.

08:49.157 --> 08:51.304
Doesn't necessarily make her
an unreliable witness.

08:51.304 --> 08:53.407
This man is a community leader.

08:53.407 --> 08:55.839
He's known for his good works
and political clout.

08:55.839 --> 08:57.424
So let's make sure we have
our ammunition

08:57.424 --> 08:59.556
before going to war with his lawyers.

08:59.556 --> 09:02.674
- Mind if I join the party?
- Well, it depends on what you brought.

09:02.968 --> 09:06.483
Evan Ramsey was investigated
for child abuse against Megan
seven years ago,

09:06.483 --> 09:09.647
but the case worker found no evidence
to support the charge.

09:09.647 --> 09:11.511
Rebecca didn't mention
anything about that.

09:11.511 --> 09:14.975
Well, it wouldn't be the first time a wife
chose her husband over her children.

09:14.975 --> 09:16.103
Since Evan's out of town,

09:16.103 --> 09:19.230
find out as much as you can
before he gets back.

09:19.230 --> 09:20.991
They're here.

09:20.991 --> 09:22.425
Okay, separate rooms.

09:22.425 --> 09:24.732
See if either one
confirms Megan's story.

09:24.732 --> 09:28.312
Meanwhile, I'll see if I can
wear down Mom with my charm.

09:28.616 --> 09:32.283
So, Lily, do you spend
a lot of time together with your daddy?

09:32.283 --> 09:38.691
Well, sometimes we go to the park
and we ride the horses.

09:38.691 --> 09:40.866
What else do you do together?

09:40.866 --> 09:44.562
He reads stories to me

09:44.562 --> 09:49.732
- and we play games.
- Yeah? What kind of games?

09:55.947 --> 09:58.818
What is it, honey?

09:59.714 --> 10:02.449
Why is everybody mad at my daddy?

10:02.449 --> 10:04.460
Well, what makes you think
that we're mad?

10:04.460 --> 10:07.621
Megan said he was doing bad things.

10:07.621 --> 10:09.398
What kind of bad things?

10:09.398 --> 10:11.767
I don't know.

10:12.861 --> 10:17.244
Lily, does your dad ever
do things that you don't like?

10:17.244 --> 10:23.271
Well, sometimes he yells
and says bad words.

10:23.271 --> 10:25.557
What else does he do
that you don't like?

10:25.557 --> 10:27.287
Nothing.

10:27.287 --> 10:29.861
My daddy loves me.

10:30.187 --> 10:31.313
I don't understand.

10:31.313 --> 10:34.715
Well, did your dad ever
touch you in a way that,

10:34.715 --> 10:36.363
you know, made you feel uncomfortable?

10:36.363 --> 10:39.453
No. He's a great dad.
He'd never do anything like that.

10:39.453 --> 10:40.872
How about with your sisters?

10:40.872 --> 10:43.899
No. Sometimes he and Megan
would argue,

10:43.899 --> 10:45.915
but he was just trying
to keep her out of trouble.

10:45.915 --> 10:47.706
Yeah? What kind of trouble?

10:47.706 --> 10:50.549
He said her boyfriend was bad news.

10:50.549 --> 10:54.157
She thought he was
trying to control her life.

10:54.157 --> 10:56.798
How's his relationship with Lily?

10:56.798 --> 10:58.994
He never yells at her.

10:58.994 --> 11:01.077
He spend a lot of time with her?

11:01.077 --> 11:03.192
I guess.

11:03.855 --> 11:06.219
So what do they do
when they hang out?

11:06.219 --> 11:08.999
They go to the park
and he reads to her.

11:08.999 --> 11:11.808
- Just the usual stuff.
- Usual stuff?

11:11.808 --> 11:14.318
Anything else?

11:17.608 --> 11:18.880
Go on.

11:18.880 --> 11:23.292
- It probably doesn't mean anything.
- So tell me anyway.

11:24.909 --> 11:27.976
Sometimes he goes
to her room at night,

11:27.976 --> 11:30.525
and I hear crying.

11:31.077 --> 11:32.984
And?

11:32.984 --> 11:38.229
He still gives her baths
with the door locked.

11:38.229 --> 11:39.857
And a few nights ago,

11:39.857 --> 11:43.187
I woke up in the middle of the night
to get a drink of water,

11:43.187 --> 11:46.038
and I saw him changing Lily's sheets.

11:46.038 --> 11:50.073
She was crying in the corner
with her bottoms off.

11:50.073 --> 11:55.130
Dad was acting weird.
He said she wet the bed.

11:58.483 --> 12:00.259
But...

12:00.817 --> 12:02.815
But what?

12:04.320 --> 12:08.177
She hasn't wet the bed
since she was two.

12:13.197 --> 12:16.499
I don't believe this.
It can't be true.

12:16.499 --> 12:19.574
Mrs. Ramsey, I know this isn't easy,
but we're grasping at straws.

12:19.574 --> 12:20.562
I've heard enough.

12:20.562 --> 12:22.710
If you give us permission
to search Lily's room,

12:22.710 --> 12:24.656
we just might come up
with some answers.

12:24.656 --> 12:27.041
I can't take this anymore.

12:31.947 --> 12:37.710
Mrs. Ramsey, there's someone
here to see you.

12:44.370 --> 12:46.101
Megan.

12:46.101 --> 12:49.717
Detective Benson told me
you'd be here.

12:52.854 --> 12:58.120
It's not true. It can't be.

13:00.019 --> 13:02.728
He raped me, Mother.

13:02.728 --> 13:08.186
I was 12 years old.
Where were you?

13:09.270 --> 13:12.370
Why didn't you help me?

13:14.459 --> 13:16.836
I didn't know.

13:17.445 --> 13:20.978
I swear to God I didn't know.

13:25.075 --> 13:28.764
We're going to need physical
examinations on Jody and Lily,

13:28.764 --> 13:31.407
and permission to search your house.

13:31.407 --> 13:34.154
Do whatever you need to do.

13:35.617 --> 13:38.604
I want my children safe.

13:44.384 --> 13:46.400
He'll be home any minute.

13:46.400 --> 13:47.946
We'll handle the introductions.

13:47.946 --> 13:49.614
Olivia!

13:52.194 --> 13:53.993
What do you got?

13:55.573 --> 13:58.758
Kiddie porn right under Lily's mattress.

13:58.758 --> 14:00.408
There you go.

14:00.739 --> 14:02.900
Got something else, Detectives.

14:03.357 --> 14:05.296
Men's underwear.

14:05.436 --> 14:06.829
Rebecca?

14:06.829 --> 14:09.469
- Everything okay?
- Bag it all. / You got it.

14:09.469 --> 14:11.875
What the hell is going on here?

14:12.924 --> 14:16.017
Evan Ramsey, New York City detectives.
We'd like you to come with us.

14:16.017 --> 14:17.313
I'm not going anywhere
till somebody tells me...

14:17.313 --> 14:19.443
- We just want to ask you a few questions.
- Look, you have no right to...

14:19.443 --> 14:21.478
Please, Mr. Ramsey, for the sake
of your daughters,

14:21.478 --> 14:24.152
let's not do this in front of them.

14:35.005 --> 14:37.578
I didn't rape my daughter.

14:37.578 --> 14:40.591
- That's not what Megan says.
- She's angry and confused.

14:40.591 --> 14:41.774
About what?

14:41.774 --> 14:43.825
I threatened to pull the plug
on her college tuition

14:43.825 --> 14:46.850
if she didn't drop that boyfriend
and start buckling down.

14:46.850 --> 14:48.796
So she's crying rape
to get back at you?

14:48.796 --> 14:50.966
I have no idea why she's doing this.

14:50.966 --> 14:52.233
I have tried to get through to her,

14:52.233 --> 14:54.521
and she just keeps pulling
further away from me.

14:54.521 --> 14:58.543
I mean, I... I try to hug her,
she recoils like I'm contagious.

14:58.543 --> 15:03.025
She said she saw you fondling
Lily in her own bed.

15:05.011 --> 15:06.917
I was helping her put on her pajamas.

15:06.917 --> 15:08.894
What about the visits to her room
in the middle of the night?

15:08.894 --> 15:11.736
- She has nightmares, for God's sake.
- Nightmares, huh?

15:11.736 --> 15:13.769
I wonder if these caused them.

15:13.769 --> 15:15.486
What?

15:16.949 --> 15:18.031
These are disgusting.

15:18.031 --> 15:21.237
Well, we found them in Lily's room,
along with a pair of your underwear.

15:21.237 --> 15:22.433
This is ridiculous.

15:22.433 --> 15:24.498
The pictures were printed
on a digital printer

15:24.498 --> 15:26.182
just like the one
next to your computer.

15:26.182 --> 15:27.629
I only use that computer for business.

15:27.629 --> 15:28.980
Yeah? That's some business.

15:28.980 --> 15:32.324
Look, I know this has gotta
come as a big shock to you,

15:32.324 --> 15:34.575
but on some level also a relief.

15:34.575 --> 15:37.337
Now you get the chance
to clear the decks, get some help.

15:37.337 --> 15:40.026
Megan has already
broken her silence.

15:40.026 --> 15:42.917
It's only a matter of time
before your other daughters join her.

15:42.917 --> 15:44.423
I haven't done anything wrong.

15:44.423 --> 15:47.188
Do you have any idea what they do
to child molesters in prison?

15:47.188 --> 15:49.044
I'm sure that they'll grow
very attached to you

15:49.044 --> 15:51.971
once they find out why you're there.

15:52.863 --> 15:55.592
- I want my lawyer.
- Fine.

15:55.592 --> 15:57.688
Do we have anything
to corroborate the rape?

15:57.688 --> 15:59.225
Only Megan's testimony.

15:59.225 --> 16:01.584
Any physical evidence is long gone.

16:01.584 --> 16:02.809
And Lily?

16:02.809 --> 16:06.305
Medical exam showed vaginal irritation,
but nothing conclusive.

16:06.305 --> 16:08.591
Jody's was negative.

16:08.591 --> 16:10.896
That leaves us with the photos
and the underwear.

16:10.896 --> 16:14.704
But Lily still hasn't provided testimony
linking them to her alleged abuse.

16:14.704 --> 16:16.320
Megan passed the poly.

16:16.320 --> 16:17.748
You know that's inadmissible.

16:17.748 --> 16:19.258
It confirms her story.

16:19.258 --> 16:23.218
We let him go, he goes
right back home to his daughters.

16:24.303 --> 16:27.670
All right.
Arrest him for the rape.

16:30.319 --> 16:33.154
- Where's my lawyer?
- He knows where to find you.

16:33.154 --> 16:34.479
- I want to know why.
- Rebecca.

16:34.479 --> 16:35.961
- Rebecca, come with me.
- No, let me do this!

16:35.961 --> 16:37.818
- Wasn't I enough?
- How could you even think that?

16:37.818 --> 16:39.513
- I trusted you!
- My God, look at me!

16:39.513 --> 16:41.575
Do you think that
I could ever hurt them?

16:41.575 --> 16:44.638
- You disgust me!
- Rebecca! Please...

16:44.638 --> 16:46.310
Don't do this!

16:46.310 --> 16:47.574
Stop!

16:53.864 --> 16:56.254
Arraignment Part 44
Thursday, February 15

16:56.254 --> 16:58.474
Mr. Ramsey, how do you plead?

16:58.474 --> 16:59.596
Not guilty.

16:59.596 --> 17:03.359
Your Honor, the defendant's financial
resources alone make him a serious flight risk.

17:03.359 --> 17:06.644
Your Honor, Mr. Ramsey's contributions
to the community are well known.

17:06.644 --> 17:09.199
He's not going anywhere
and he's a danger to no one.

17:09.199 --> 17:12.064
Except perhaps to his daughters.

17:12.064 --> 17:16.492
I'm setting bail at $500,000,
or $5 million surety.

17:16.492 --> 17:18.615
Your Honor, given the nature
of the offenses charged,

17:18.615 --> 17:20.483
the People request an order of protection

17:20.483 --> 17:22.684
barring the defendant from entering
the family residence

17:22.684 --> 17:26.222
or from coming within
100 yards of his children.

17:26.222 --> 17:28.031
So ordered.

17:30.174 --> 17:32.479
So I hear that your daddy reads to you.

17:32.479 --> 17:33.881
Yeah.

17:33.881 --> 17:35.985
What's your favorite story?

17:35.985 --> 17:39.231
I took her to see
Megan's therapist.

17:39.231 --> 17:43.198
Afterwards, she rattled off the symptoms
like a shopping list.

17:43.198 --> 17:46.616
The crying, the sleepless nights.

17:47.058 --> 17:54.430
She says Lily's blocking it all out
because it's too much for her to bear.

17:54.430 --> 17:57.373
It's so clear now.

17:57.903 --> 18:00.284
Why didn't I see it?

18:00.284 --> 18:04.361
Because he went through a lot of trouble
to make sure that you didn't.

18:05.445 --> 18:06.704
Can I talk to her?

18:06.704 --> 18:08.096
Please.

18:09.802 --> 18:11.141
Well?

18:11.141 --> 18:12.959
She hasn't disclosed anything.

18:12.959 --> 18:14.154
She's scared.

18:14.154 --> 18:15.378
Wouldn't you be?

18:15.378 --> 18:17.525
She knows her father's in trouble
and she's the cause.

18:17.525 --> 18:19.360
If we don't get her testimony
by day after tomorrow,

18:19.360 --> 18:21.885
I can't indict her case with Megan's.

18:21.885 --> 18:23.541
Megan's case can't stand on its own.

18:23.541 --> 18:26.375
I'll do the best I can,
but it's a slow dance,

18:26.375 --> 18:28.483
and I have to follow her lead.

18:29.023 --> 18:31.653
Police Crime Lab
1 Centre Street
Thursday, February 15

18:31.653 --> 18:34.841
DNA analysis matched hair and
fluids in the underwear to Evan Ramsey,

18:34.841 --> 18:38.853
but we found nothing in the bed sheets
or Lily's nightclothes.

18:38.853 --> 18:40.389
What about the pictures?

18:40.389 --> 18:42.870
Even with ninhydrin,
we couldn't raise any prints.

18:42.870 --> 18:44.970
In other words, we got a big fat zero.

18:44.970 --> 18:47.134
Not quite.
Take a look at the photo.

18:47.134 --> 18:50.734
The border was found
in a trash container in Lily's bathroom.

18:51.085 --> 18:53.997
See how it matches the cut pattern
on the bottom?

18:53.997 --> 18:56.699
Look at the date.
February 13.

18:56.699 --> 18:58.821
Yeah, it's the date
they were downloaded.

18:58.821 --> 19:00.276
Tuesday.

19:00.276 --> 19:01.766
You thinking what I'm thinking?

19:01.766 --> 19:04.938
Evan was in Baltimore on Tuesday.

19:05.291 --> 19:09.094
I'm computer illiterate.
I can't even turn the damn thing on.

19:09.094 --> 19:10.549
What about your children?

19:10.549 --> 19:12.647
You can't be serious.

19:12.647 --> 19:15.493
Did it ever occur to you that the date
might have been set wrong?

19:15.493 --> 19:16.666
We'll check that out.

19:16.666 --> 19:19.323
But in the meantime, we need
to cover all of our bases.

19:19.323 --> 19:20.516
My kids were at school,

19:20.516 --> 19:23.258
and I was at my lawyer's
office filing for divorce.

19:23.258 --> 19:24.484
And where was Megan?

19:24.484 --> 19:25.816
Megan doesn't live here.

19:25.816 --> 19:28.671
- But she has a key.
- Yeah.

19:28.671 --> 19:30.789
And where were you
Tuesday morning?

19:30.789 --> 19:32.686
I was at the grocery store.

19:32.686 --> 19:36.780
So no one can say for sure
whether Megan came home or not.

19:36.780 --> 19:39.799
All I know is Megan has a chemistry class
every Tuesday morning.

19:39.799 --> 19:41.361
Did she go?

19:41.361 --> 19:43.339
You'd have to ask her.

19:43.565 --> 19:45.282
I dropped chemistry.

19:45.282 --> 19:47.665
I haven't been able to
concentrate very well this semester.

19:47.665 --> 19:49.475
So what have you been doing
with your Tuesday mornings?

19:49.475 --> 19:51.983
I've been working with a tutor, trying to
catch up on my other classes.

19:51.983 --> 19:53.965
- This tutor got a name?
- Michael Tobin.

19:53.965 --> 19:56.990
- Were you with him last Tuesday?
- No.

19:56.990 --> 19:59.018
Thought you just said
you had a tutor.

19:59.018 --> 20:01.021
He was my boyfriend.
We broke up last week.

20:01.021 --> 20:02.459
So where were you then?

20:02.459 --> 20:04.620
- In the library studying.
- Anyone with you?

20:04.620 --> 20:06.572
Yeah, lots of people.
It's mid-terms.

20:06.572 --> 20:10.911
Look, I'm going to be late for a class.
Can we talk about this later?

20:13.496 --> 20:14.962
You gotta be kidding me.

20:14.962 --> 20:16.624
Hard drives don't lie.

20:16.624 --> 20:19.232
This one shows nothing but spreadsheets,
business correspondence,

20:19.232 --> 20:21.402
and a couple of hits
on a stock-trading website.

20:21.402 --> 20:23.969
- What about his laptop?
- Clean as a whistle.

20:23.969 --> 20:26.132
So his account was accessed
by another computer.

20:26.132 --> 20:28.365
Someone who knows
his password.

20:28.365 --> 20:30.377
Can you give us the location
of the download?

20:30.377 --> 20:33.713
You'd have to talk to the ISP for that.

20:34.359 --> 20:36.683
If Evan didn't download
those pictures, then who did?

20:36.683 --> 20:37.968
And why?

20:37.968 --> 20:40.887
The only one who can tell us
what happened in that bedroom is Lily.

20:40.887 --> 20:43.277
She's not talking.
At least not to us.

20:43.277 --> 20:45.296
But she did talk
to Megan's therapist.

20:45.296 --> 20:48.227
Does Dr. Wharton accept walk-ins?

20:48.679 --> 20:50.643
I'm not surprised she's resisting.

20:50.643 --> 20:52.578
We really need her testimony.

20:52.578 --> 20:54.000
Megan's isn't enough?

20:54.000 --> 20:56.971
Without Lily to corroborate,
it's just Evan's word against Megan's.

20:56.971 --> 21:00.166
Excuse me. / Our psychiatrist thinks
that Lily's protecting her father.

21:00.166 --> 21:03.076
She may feel more comfortable
talking to you.

21:03.076 --> 21:06.089
I've only seen her once,
but we did develop a rapport.

21:06.089 --> 21:07.661
I'll clear my schedule.

21:07.661 --> 21:09.522
Well, we appreciate that.

21:10.226 --> 21:11.923
Sure. Okay.

21:11.923 --> 21:13.503
All right, bye.

21:14.134 --> 21:16.403
Munch checked with Evan's
internet service provider.

21:16.403 --> 21:22.051
The kiddie porn was downloaded to
a terminal at the student library at Columbia.

21:24.053 --> 21:27.238
Those pictures were downloaded
while your father was out of town.

21:27.238 --> 21:29.461
You put the pictures
under the mattress.

21:29.461 --> 21:32.094
No. / You planted your father's
underwear in the sheets.

21:32.094 --> 21:35.248
- No.
- Why did you do it, Megan?

21:37.666 --> 21:39.077
He was going to
get away with it again.

21:39.077 --> 21:41.149
Well, tell us the truth.
Maybe we can help.

21:41.149 --> 21:43.449
No one can help.

21:43.449 --> 21:45.659
He's too powerful.

21:47.368 --> 21:49.024
When he came to my apartment,

21:49.024 --> 21:53.766
he threatened to sue my therapist
and send me to a mental hospital.

21:54.041 --> 21:55.523
Who would believe me then?

21:55.523 --> 22:01.957
Some crazy girl telling wild stories
about her sex fiend father?

22:01.957 --> 22:06.510
I had to stop him. I couldn't
let it happen again.

22:09.919 --> 22:12.864
Motion Hearing Part 65
Tuesday, February 20

22:12.864 --> 22:14.587
In light of these developments,

22:14.587 --> 22:17.017
we submit the People have no case,

22:17.017 --> 22:21.036
and therefore move that the charges
against my client be dismissed.

22:21.036 --> 22:23.202
Your Honor, the evidence
in question has no bearing

22:23.202 --> 22:25.163
on the rape case
pending before this court.

22:25.163 --> 22:29.054
But it does bring into serious question
the veracity of the complaining witness.

22:29.054 --> 22:31.871
With no physical evidence
to support her allegations,

22:31.871 --> 22:34.697
the People have failed to meet
their obligations under the law.

22:34.697 --> 22:37.472
Have the People
anything new to present?

22:37.472 --> 22:39.315
No, Your Honor.

22:39.315 --> 22:41.710
Then I have to agree
with Mr. Wilmington.

22:41.710 --> 22:43.531
Case dismissed.

22:43.531 --> 22:47.152
Mr. Ramsey, you're free to go
with the court's apology.

22:52.300 --> 22:56.759
Megan, honey, I know
you didn't mean to do this.

22:59.949 --> 23:03.080
I want you moved out
by the end of the week.

23:12.518 --> 23:13.965
What a mess.

23:13.965 --> 23:15.714
If Megan hadn't screwed up
the investigation,

23:15.714 --> 23:17.472
we might have nailed him.

23:18.025 --> 23:19.388
Stabler.

23:19.388 --> 23:21.359
She's trying to protect her sister.

23:21.359 --> 23:23.709
Yeah, well, the road to hell's
paved with good intentions.

23:23.709 --> 23:25.204
It doesn't mean she wasn't raped.

23:25.204 --> 23:26.776
Now we'll never prove it.

23:26.776 --> 23:27.989
And if she's telling the truth,

23:27.989 --> 23:30.149
that means that he got away
with it all over again.

23:30.149 --> 23:32.699
Not quite.
That was the Captain.

23:32.699 --> 23:35.167
Evan Ramsey was murdered.

23:41.038 --> 23:44.786
Dropped him on the spot.
Single gunshot to the chest.

23:44.786 --> 23:47.476
Powder burns
indicate close range.

23:47.476 --> 23:48.991
When?

23:48.991 --> 23:50.847
No rigor.
Blood's still pooling.

23:52.657 --> 23:55.048
This is Richard Weiss,
one of the company executives.

23:55.048 --> 23:57.115
He discovered the body.

23:57.865 --> 23:59.694
Let's take a walk, Mr. Weiss.

23:59.694 --> 24:02.201
We were both working late.

24:02.201 --> 24:04.653
About 9:00 I cut out
to grab some dinner.

24:04.653 --> 24:08.298
I came back to pick up some
papers and saw the light on.

24:08.298 --> 24:10.653
Went in to say good night,
and there he was,

24:10.653 --> 24:12.903
just lying there,
blood everywhere.

24:12.903 --> 24:15.398
- About what time was that?
- 10:30, 11:00.

24:15.398 --> 24:18.903
- You see anyone else?
- Not a soul.

24:20.031 --> 24:23.329
You have any idea
who might have done this?

24:23.329 --> 24:25.713
Evan's style put off a lot of people,

24:25.713 --> 24:29.696
but no one would do
something like this.

24:29.902 --> 24:31.629
Unless...

24:31.860 --> 24:33.155
Unless what?

24:33.155 --> 24:35.538
Things were pretty tense
between him and his father-in-law.

24:35.538 --> 24:36.883
- Charles Southerland?
- Yeah.

24:36.883 --> 24:39.558
Ever since Evan took the company public,
the old man's been on a tear,

24:39.558 --> 24:42.851
claiming Evan stole the business
he built from the ground up.

24:42.851 --> 24:46.225
The molestation charges
just seemed to add fuel to the fire.

24:46.225 --> 24:48.132
Get him hot enough to do this?

24:48.132 --> 24:48.977
I don't know.

24:48.977 --> 24:51.714
But this afternoon,
he stormed into Evan's office

24:51.714 --> 24:54.795
- and went into a tirade.
- About what?

24:54.795 --> 24:56.893
He called Evan a rapist.

24:56.893 --> 24:58.221
Told him he wasn't going to
get away with it,

24:58.221 --> 24:59.593
no matter what the courts said.

24:59.593 --> 25:00.808
How'd Evan react?

25:00.808 --> 25:02.512
He tried to reason with him.

25:02.512 --> 25:04.394
The old man wouldn't listen.

25:04.394 --> 25:08.611
They'd have come to blows if security
hadn't escorted the old guy out.

25:10.234 --> 25:13.663
Ornithoptera priamus poseidon.

25:13.663 --> 25:17.072
Cairns Birdwing.
It's quite a rare prize.

25:17.072 --> 25:20.313
You don't seem too upset
about your son-in-law's untimely death.

25:20.313 --> 25:24.009
If you're asking me if I'm glad
he's dead, the answer is yes.

25:24.009 --> 25:26.986
If you're asking me if I killed him,
the answer is no.

25:26.986 --> 25:29.664
Although, I'd like to buy
the fellow who did it a drink.

25:29.664 --> 25:31.214
Well, it must have stuck in your craw

25:31.214 --> 25:33.239
when the charges against
your son-in-law were dropped.

25:33.239 --> 25:36.729
Yes. But things have a way
of working out, don't they?

25:36.729 --> 25:38.879
After dinner, where did you
and your daughter go?

25:38.879 --> 25:40.852
I took her home,

25:40.852 --> 25:43.119
came back here,

25:43.119 --> 25:46.018
poured myself a Scotch,
and went to bed.

25:46.018 --> 25:48.417
Evan was killed by a .32 slug.

25:48.417 --> 25:51.680
You own a.32 caliber
Derringer, don't you?

25:51.680 --> 25:53.399
Yes.

25:53.611 --> 25:57.292
An LM5 Simmerling
with a scrimshaw handle.

25:57.292 --> 26:00.434
- Legally registered.
- We'd like to see it.

26:01.221 --> 26:02.854
Right this way.

26:03.996 --> 26:06.809
I also have an authentic
Revolutionary musket,

26:06.809 --> 26:11.326
a pearl-handled Colt .45
and a World War I Luger.

26:11.624 --> 26:14.717
Keep them all in top firing condition, too.

26:17.709 --> 26:19.808
There a problem, Mr. Southerland?

26:19.808 --> 26:21.383
It's gone.

26:21.383 --> 26:22.807
Gone?

26:22.807 --> 26:24.975
My gun.
It's supposed to be in here.

26:24.975 --> 26:27.278
You'd better come with us.

26:29.612 --> 26:31.852
Evan stole your company.

26:31.852 --> 26:33.280
He molested your grandchildren.

26:33.280 --> 26:35.604
We can certainly understand
why you'd want justice.

26:35.604 --> 26:37.594
You've got it all figured out,
don't you?

26:37.594 --> 26:40.258
Company executives heard you arguing
just a few hours before.

26:40.258 --> 26:42.666
And now your.32 caliber
Derringer's missing.

26:42.666 --> 26:44.768
You care to explain that?

26:48.898 --> 26:51.079
Think of your family.

26:51.786 --> 26:55.992
After all they've been through, isn't
it time just to put an end to all of this?

26:55.992 --> 27:00.941
Don't presume to tell me
about my family, Detective.

27:01.820 --> 27:03.037
How does he look?

27:03.037 --> 27:05.691
Opportunity, motive,
access to a weapon,

27:05.691 --> 27:07.574
but I don't know.

27:07.574 --> 27:10.188
What? / The guy seemed genuinely
surprised that his gun was missing.

27:10.188 --> 27:11.970
I mean, you'd think that if he's
going to murder somebody,

27:11.970 --> 27:15.333
he'd at least concoct a plausible
explanation for its disappearance.

27:15.333 --> 27:17.042
Yeah, and sometimes they just freeze

27:17.042 --> 27:19.418
when they get caught
with their hand in the cookie jar.

27:19.418 --> 27:22.872
A CSU conducted another canvass.

27:22.872 --> 27:27.512
Located a .32 caliber
Simmerling Derringer in a sewer drain

27:27.512 --> 27:30.189
in the parking structure
of Southerland's office building.

27:30.189 --> 27:32.653
They're running a check now.

27:38.238 --> 27:39.848
Serial number matches.

27:39.848 --> 27:42.070
This is definitely Southerland's.

27:43.119 --> 27:47.082
Now, the bullet removed
from Ramsey's body was on the left.

27:48.247 --> 27:51.640
The bullet from the water tank
will be on your right.

27:52.463 --> 27:54.450
See the lands and grooves?

27:54.450 --> 27:57.057
Here and here.

27:57.786 --> 28:00.431
Identical twins. / You've found
your murder weapon.

28:00.431 --> 28:01.523
Any prints?

28:01.523 --> 28:03.647
The water in the gutter
degraded the surface of the gun,

28:03.647 --> 28:05.235
making it impossible to lift any.

28:05.235 --> 28:08.654
However, we got a couple of clean ones
from the shell casings.

28:08.654 --> 28:12.613
But unfortunately, Miguel,
they don't match Southerland's prints.

28:12.613 --> 28:15.789
You got your weapon,
not your killer.

28:17.038 --> 28:18.502
Where were you last night?

28:18.502 --> 28:21.861
I had dinner with my father,
then came right home.

28:21.861 --> 28:24.797
- What time did you get in?
- Around 9:00.

28:24.797 --> 28:26.866
And who else was here?

28:26.866 --> 28:29.876
My daughters
and my housekeeper.

28:29.876 --> 28:32.249
- We all went to bed.
- Mom.

28:33.447 --> 28:34.974
What are they doing here?

28:34.974 --> 28:38.493
We were just talking to her
about last night.

28:40.048 --> 28:43.531
I'm very sorry for your loss,
but we have to ask you a few questions.

28:43.531 --> 28:44.508
Like what?

28:44.508 --> 28:47.126
Where were you between
the hours of 7:00 and 11:00?

28:47.126 --> 28:50.178
I picked Jody up from her dance class
and I brought her back here.

28:50.178 --> 28:53.941
- Can anyone corroborate that?
- I can.

28:53.941 --> 28:55.081
She stayed the night.

28:55.081 --> 28:58.821
After what happened in court,
I wanted all my children here with me.

28:58.821 --> 29:01.228
You had no other contact
with your father?

29:01.228 --> 29:03.068
I cut my father out of my life.

29:03.068 --> 29:07.304
Megan, honey, could you check
on your sisters for me?

29:09.489 --> 29:11.398
Is there a point to these questions?

29:11.398 --> 29:14.383
Your daughter planted evidence
to incriminate him.

29:14.383 --> 29:16.506
And he raped her until she was 14.

29:16.506 --> 29:18.379
Maybe that evens things out.

29:18.379 --> 29:20.959
- What about you?
- What about me?

29:20.959 --> 29:22.751
He molested your daughters.

29:22.751 --> 29:25.657
His death gives you
a permanent order of protection.

29:25.657 --> 29:28.860
He should burn in hell for
what he did to my daughters,

29:28.860 --> 29:31.047
but I didn't kill him.

29:31.047 --> 29:34.456
Now, if you'll excuse me,
my children need me.

29:34.456 --> 29:36.658
Marina will see you out.

29:38.823 --> 29:41.084
The only people who had access
to Charles' gun collection

29:41.084 --> 29:42.436
were his immediate family.

29:42.436 --> 29:45.428
Rebecca claims all the kids
were tucked into bed by 9:00.

29:45.428 --> 29:48.694
How convenient. A family of suspects
giving each other an airtight alibi.

29:48.694 --> 29:50.190
- Except Megan's.
- What you got?

29:50.190 --> 29:51.168
Phone records.

29:51.168 --> 29:53.493
Someone was placing phone calls
to her father's office

29:53.493 --> 29:55.785
from her car phone
between 9:30 and 10:00.

29:55.785 --> 29:57.575
She was supposed to be fast asleep.

29:57.575 --> 30:00.943
Sounds like Megan's airtight alibi
just sprung a leak.

30:04.175 --> 30:06.132
You've been the Ramsey's
housekeeper for how long?

30:06.132 --> 30:07.093
Ten years.

30:07.093 --> 30:09.961
What time did the lady of the house
get in last Tuesday night?

30:09.961 --> 30:12.418
- About 9:00.
- You sure?

30:12.418 --> 30:14.203
Tuesdays is The New Detectives
on cable.

30:14.203 --> 30:16.367
I was watching when
Mrs. Ramsey came home.

30:16.367 --> 30:18.243
She took a sleeping pill
and went to bed.

30:18.243 --> 30:20.678
What about the girls?
What time did they come home?

30:20.678 --> 30:21.960
Same time.

30:21.960 --> 30:24.932
But later they went out.

30:25.189 --> 30:26.929
What time did they get back?

30:26.929 --> 30:30.298
Charlie Rose was on by then,
so it must have been after 11:00.

30:30.298 --> 30:32.124
They say anything?

30:32.124 --> 30:33.433
No.

30:33.433 --> 30:36.975
They just went up to Jody's room
and closed the door.

30:38.102 --> 30:40.673
And?

30:41.098 --> 30:44.395
And I heard lots of crying.

30:45.736 --> 30:47.359
Mrs. Ramsey...

30:48.265 --> 30:50.342
We're meeting our priest.
Can't this wait?

30:50.342 --> 30:52.259
Sorry, but it can't.

30:52.259 --> 30:54.895
I've already told you
everything I know.

30:54.895 --> 30:57.895
Actually, we're here
to speak with Jody. / Me?

30:57.895 --> 31:00.392
Your housekeeper said you left the house
after your mother went to bed.

31:00.392 --> 31:02.108
Well, she's mistaken.

31:02.108 --> 31:05.241
The girls went to bed when I did.
Tell them, Jody.

31:05.241 --> 31:06.769
You've already lied to your mother.

31:06.769 --> 31:10.284
Don't make it any harder
on yourself by lying now.

31:15.152 --> 31:17.486
Daddy had been calling Megan.

31:17.486 --> 31:19.198
She wanted him to admit
what he'd done,

31:19.198 --> 31:21.289
but he said he wouldn't do it
over the phone.

31:21.289 --> 31:23.306
So you drove to his office.

31:23.306 --> 31:24.797
What happened
when you got there?

31:24.797 --> 31:26.367
Megan went inside.

31:26.367 --> 31:27.425
What about you?

31:27.425 --> 31:29.258
She told me to wait in the car.

31:29.258 --> 31:30.730
And then what?

31:30.730 --> 31:33.495
A few minutes later,
she came back out and we left.

31:33.495 --> 31:35.809
She say anything
about what happened?

31:35.809 --> 31:38.539
No, she didn't want to
talk about it.

31:38.539 --> 31:40.526
We just got in the car
and drove home.

31:40.526 --> 31:42.972
Mom was asleep,
so we went to bed.

31:42.972 --> 31:45.367
Why didn't you tell me?

31:45.367 --> 31:47.966
We knew you were mad at us
for seeing him,

31:47.966 --> 31:50.422
so we lied.

31:54.131 --> 31:55.686
Okay, let's go over that one more time.

31:55.686 --> 31:57.033
I told you, I don't remember.

31:57.033 --> 32:00.103
Megan, you're not doing
yourself any favors here.

32:00.103 --> 32:02.898
We have your phone records.
We know that you went to see him.

32:02.898 --> 32:05.323
- Just tell us what happened.
- I would tell you if I could.

32:05.323 --> 32:07.376
Well, why can't you?

32:07.761 --> 32:09.804
Sometimes I black out.

32:09.804 --> 32:11.737
Oh, come on, Megan. You're gonna
have to do better than that.

32:11.737 --> 32:13.982
You took your grandfather's pistol
and you shot your father.

32:13.982 --> 32:15.588
- No, I couldn't have.
- Did he threaten you?

32:15.588 --> 32:17.717
I don't remember.

32:17.717 --> 32:20.757
I didn't remember I was raped
until a few months ago.

32:20.757 --> 32:22.446
Ask my therapist.

32:22.446 --> 32:25.778
She said I couldn't get away from him,
so I pushed out the memory.

32:25.778 --> 32:29.773
I wish it had stayed away,
because now I can't forget it.

32:30.716 --> 32:34.382
I am no longer at liberty
to discuss Megan's treatment.

32:34.382 --> 32:36.064
But you talked to us before.

32:36.064 --> 32:39.097
Megan has decided
not to waive privilege.

32:39.097 --> 32:42.014
Well, she's a suspect
in her father's murder.

32:42.014 --> 32:43.471
If you thought she was
going to commit a crime,

32:43.471 --> 32:46.016
you're legally obligated to report it.

32:46.016 --> 32:50.285
I have been a therapist
for 15 years, Detective.

32:50.285 --> 32:53.070
I don't need a lecture in ethics.

32:53.070 --> 32:56.999
Okay, can you answer some general
questions about your treatment techniques?

32:56.999 --> 33:01.083
I'll try. / How exactly do you
recover buried memories?

33:01.083 --> 33:04.693
With intense therapy.

33:06.138 --> 33:08.990
Can you be more specific?

33:09.534 --> 33:15.970
Generally, the process begins
by recovering a flashback.

33:15.970 --> 33:20.080
A snapshot in time.

33:20.294 --> 33:24.709
And slowly, more and more
snapshots appear

33:24.709 --> 33:28.556
until the collage becomes
a complete picture.

33:28.556 --> 33:32.068
Once the patient faces
what happened to her,

33:32.068 --> 33:33.782
she can begin to heal.

33:33.782 --> 33:36.763
How do you know if the patient's
telling the truth?

33:36.763 --> 33:42.067
I engage a physician
to administer sodium amytal.

33:42.067 --> 33:44.139
Truth serum.

33:46.072 --> 33:50.314
A tranquilizer that reduces resistance

33:50.314 --> 33:54.330
and enables the therapist
to probe for inconsistencies

33:54.330 --> 33:56.373
and verify the memories.

33:56.373 --> 34:02.492
Okay, but what if you overlook
your patient's inconsistencies?

34:02.492 --> 34:07.049
I don't overlook them,
Detective, I explore them.

34:07.049 --> 34:09.485
I don't shy away
from the tough cases,

34:09.485 --> 34:12.913
and I have an exemplary
record of success

34:12.913 --> 34:14.742
where others have failed.

34:14.742 --> 34:17.408
Is Megan a success story?

34:19.072 --> 34:21.590
I think this conversation
has gone on long enough.

34:21.590 --> 34:25.891
If you'll excuse me, my next
appointment is waiting.

34:28.205 --> 34:31.340
Well, technically it's called
the false memory syndrome,

34:31.340 --> 34:34.920
but I call it the power of
suggestion run amuck.

34:34.920 --> 34:37.761
She said that sodium amytal
verifies memories.

34:37.761 --> 34:39.699
More like creates them.

34:39.699 --> 34:42.750
That's why it's fallen out of
favor with most reputable therapists,

34:42.750 --> 34:46.331
but some die-hard advocates
still administer it.

34:46.331 --> 34:47.404
How does it work?

34:47.404 --> 34:50.327
It places the patient
in a semi-hypnotic state,

34:50.327 --> 34:53.079
making them extremely
vulnerable to manipulation.

34:53.079 --> 34:56.103
This is especially true
if they're already in a fragile state.

34:56.103 --> 34:57.139
Like Megan.

34:57.139 --> 35:00.419
Right. She fits the profile.

35:00.707 --> 35:04.293
I remember reading this case in which
a young woman had convinced the police

35:04.293 --> 35:07.046
to dig up a park in search
of bodies of young boys

35:07.046 --> 35:08.729
that she claimed her father
had buried there

35:08.729 --> 35:10.668
after raping and torturing them.

35:10.668 --> 35:13.084
The fact that no such bodies
were ever found did not deter her

35:13.084 --> 35:14.767
from believing
that they were still there.

35:14.767 --> 35:17.727
And then, later, it was revealed that
the whole thing was planted in her head

35:17.727 --> 35:20.466
during a sodium amytal
interview by her therapist.

35:20.466 --> 35:22.401
So there's a good chance
that Megan was never raped.

35:22.401 --> 35:24.285
More than a chance.

35:25.793 --> 35:27.573
These are Megan's medical records.

35:27.573 --> 35:32.417
We got a subpoena when she canceled
her physical exam for the third time.

35:33.106 --> 35:34.901
An intact hymen.

35:34.901 --> 35:36.901
She's a virgin.

35:39.376 --> 35:41.304
So Megan's memories
of childhood rape...

35:41.304 --> 35:43.766
Are just figments of her
therapist's imagination.

35:43.766 --> 35:47.085
And Evan Ramsey was accused
on spectral evidence.

35:47.085 --> 35:49.423
And we all had a hand in it.

35:49.423 --> 35:51.676
However, the forensics
aren't spectral.

35:51.676 --> 35:54.209
The lab matched the prints
on the shell casings to Megan's.

35:54.209 --> 35:55.563
What about her state of mind?

35:55.563 --> 35:57.426
Megan believes that she was raped,

35:57.426 --> 35:58.964
but none of this would have happened

35:58.964 --> 36:01.764
if that therapist hadn't filled her mind
with a lot of garbage.

36:01.764 --> 36:04.451
The therapist didn't
pull the trigger. Megan did.

36:04.451 --> 36:07.311
Look, she planted those photographs
and she lied about it.

36:07.311 --> 36:09.677
That shows a clear
and logical state of mind.

36:09.677 --> 36:11.281
Her fingerprints
are on the shell casings,

36:11.281 --> 36:13.578
and her own sister places her
at the scene of the crime.

36:13.578 --> 36:15.381
Jody's not going to want to testify.

36:15.381 --> 36:16.533
Well, I'm issuing a subpoena.

36:16.533 --> 36:19.171
She'll testify
or she'll be in contempt.

36:19.739 --> 36:22.571
Grand Jury Room 12
Friday, February 23

36:22.571 --> 36:25.703
Dad called Megan after
the charges were dropped.

36:25.703 --> 36:30.102
He said he wanted to see her,
to be a family again.

36:30.617 --> 36:34.599
She wanted to put an end to it,
but she was scared.

36:34.599 --> 36:37.414
Is that why she asked
you to come along?

36:37.414 --> 36:39.326
Yes.

36:40.136 --> 36:42.504
Where did you go?

36:48.470 --> 36:50.254
Jody?

36:51.057 --> 36:53.980
We drove to my dad's office building.

36:53.980 --> 36:57.103
What happened
when you got there?

36:57.449 --> 37:00.996
Megan got out of the car
and went inside.

37:00.996 --> 37:03.386
Where were you?

37:06.604 --> 37:11.650
I know this is really hard for you,
but I need you to answer the question.

37:17.648 --> 37:20.394
She didn't do it.

37:21.006 --> 37:22.281
Jody...

37:22.281 --> 37:24.060
It was me.

37:24.060 --> 37:26.905
I didn't mean for it to happen.

37:26.905 --> 37:29.752
The gun just went off.

37:32.502 --> 37:35.597
I didn't mean to kill him.

37:38.042 --> 37:40.269
I'm sorry.

37:44.292 --> 37:46.658
I'm sorry.

37:47.227 --> 37:49.064
Prosecuting 101, Counselor.

37:49.064 --> 37:52.372
Don't rely on potential defendants
to make your case to the grand jury.

37:52.372 --> 37:54.142
Jody wasn't a defendant,
she was a witness,

37:54.142 --> 37:56.447
and without her testimony
we couldn't put Megan at the crime scene.

37:56.447 --> 37:59.070
Oh, it never occurred to you
she might confess to protect her sister?

37:59.070 --> 38:00.551
We questioned her
a number of times.

38:00.551 --> 38:01.958
Her story never changed.

38:01.958 --> 38:05.152
Until you gave her immunity,
in exchange for her testimony.

38:05.152 --> 38:07.402
Her immunity doesn't extend
to cover perjury.

38:07.402 --> 38:09.725
Perjury? What if she's telling the truth?

38:09.725 --> 38:12.393
You just freed a 15-year-old killer.

38:12.393 --> 38:15.054
We had every reason to believe
that Megan Ramsey killed her father.

38:15.054 --> 38:16.592
I'm still not convinced she didn't.

38:16.592 --> 38:18.920
You're gonna have a hard time
convincing a jury

38:18.920 --> 38:22.370
if your star witness says she's the one
who pulled the trigger.

38:22.370 --> 38:24.082
I'm on my honeymoon here, Ms. Cabot,

38:24.082 --> 38:27.838
so I can still blame my predecessor
for all the screw-ups in this division.

38:27.838 --> 38:30.867
Unfortunately, I told the D.A.

38:30.867 --> 38:32.925
I supported your strategy.

38:32.925 --> 38:35.564
So do us both a favor, huh?

38:35.847 --> 38:37.918
Fix this mess.

38:44.536 --> 38:48.294
I'm sure your lawyer already
told you you have immunity.

38:49.874 --> 38:52.684
That means I cannot prosecute you
for anything you say to me now,

38:52.684 --> 38:54.505
unless you lie to me.

38:54.505 --> 38:57.303
Then all bets are off,
you understand?

38:57.667 --> 38:59.367
Okay.

38:59.367 --> 39:01.563
Now...

39:02.416 --> 39:06.552
Just tell me the truth.
What happened?

39:07.181 --> 39:11.156
Megan was too afraid
to go in alone.

39:11.801 --> 39:16.496
By the time we got to his office door,
she was shaking.

39:17.955 --> 39:20.924
When he got up from his desk,
she started screaming.

39:20.924 --> 39:22.459
He grabbed her
and he shook her

39:22.459 --> 39:25.096
and he told her to be quiet.

39:26.003 --> 39:29.160
She dropped her purse

39:30.125 --> 39:32.889
and I saw the gun.

39:33.318 --> 39:36.037
I picked it up

39:36.037 --> 39:40.112
and I told him to let her go,
but he wouldn't listen.

39:40.809 --> 39:43.958
He just kept yelling and yelling,

39:43.958 --> 39:46.722
and I hollered, "Stop!"

39:48.084 --> 39:51.618
He just stared at me.

39:51.914 --> 39:55.799
Then he reached for the gun.

39:57.247 --> 40:00.347
It just went off.

40:01.453 --> 40:05.045
He looked so surprised.

40:08.909 --> 40:11.424
It was an accident.

40:11.424 --> 40:14.502
I loved my daddy.

40:17.610 --> 40:21.482
I just wanted him
to stop hurting Megan.

40:28.303 --> 40:31.533
How do I make sense of this?

40:32.207 --> 40:35.120
My husband is dead,

40:35.120 --> 40:38.595
killed by my own child's hand

40:38.595 --> 40:43.134
and my willingness to believe
he was a monster.

40:44.588 --> 40:48.552
How awful it must have been
for my husband

40:48.552 --> 40:53.963
to know that the people
he loved most had turned on him.

40:56.785 --> 41:00.567
We all share that burden,
Mrs. Ramsey.

41:01.362 --> 41:04.413
Jody will not be prosecuted.

41:04.413 --> 41:09.289
Not by the courts,
only by her own conscience.

41:09.289 --> 41:13.067
But what about that woman
who treated my daughter with lies?

41:13.067 --> 41:16.407
How many more families
will she destroy?

41:16.768 --> 41:20.490
Megan went to her seeking help.

41:24.184 --> 41:27.796
The patient has exhibited signs
of acute and...

41:27.796 --> 41:29.475
Dr. Wharton.

41:29.761 --> 41:31.855
I'm in the middle of something.

41:31.855 --> 41:33.457
If you'd like to make an appointment...

41:33.457 --> 41:34.961
Not today.

41:34.961 --> 41:35.896
What is this?

41:35.896 --> 41:37.277
A subpoena for the medical records

41:37.277 --> 41:41.223
pertaining to the treatment of
Megan, Jody and Lily Ramsey.

41:41.223 --> 41:43.536
Those records are confidential!

41:43.536 --> 41:45.294
We'll take extra special care of them.

41:45.294 --> 41:48.026
You'll also find a warrant
for your arrest.

41:48.026 --> 41:49.085
On what charge?

41:49.085 --> 41:51.276
Reckless endangerment
in the death of Evan Ramsey.

41:51.276 --> 41:53.616
That's outrageous. Meg...

41:53.616 --> 41:55.927
Megan is a very sick woman.

41:55.927 --> 41:58.548
That you made even sicker
with your sodium amytal sessions.

41:58.548 --> 42:00.778
Oh, you're hardly qualified
to pass judgment.

42:00.778 --> 42:02.759
Maybe not, but Megan's
new therapist is,

42:02.759 --> 42:06.075
and he's willing to testify that
your sessions amounted to malpractice.

42:06.075 --> 42:07.052
Based on what?

42:07.052 --> 42:09.324
Megan recanted her accusations.

42:09.324 --> 42:11.550
He said that you
manipulated her memory.

42:11.550 --> 42:14.567
Why, the family is in denial.

42:14.567 --> 42:17.354
They're just looking for a scapegoat.

42:17.354 --> 42:18.848
They're looking for justice.

42:18.848 --> 42:20.768
The Ramseys filed suit this morning.

42:20.768 --> 42:24.852
The State Board has suspended
your license pending a full investigation.

42:24.852 --> 42:28.522
All around, I'd say this is a day
that you'll never forget.
