WEBVTT

00:55.187 --> 00:57.465
Hold on, let me...

01:01.400 --> 01:03.954
Let me just... I dropped the horse.

01:04.092 --> 01:05.093
Hold on.

01:07.302 --> 01:08.855
There. Look.

01:08.993 --> 01:10.650
Ta-da! See?

01:10.788 --> 01:11.858
Is it broken?

01:11.996 --> 01:14.861
No, look. Daddy fixed it.
No, wait.

01:14.999 --> 01:17.519
I'll give it to you when you
tell me where we are first.

01:17.657 --> 01:19.901
Dad's dad's house. That's right.

01:20.039 --> 01:22.179
This was Grandpa's house.

01:22.317 --> 01:23.698
Here, you want the camera?

01:23.836 --> 01:25.251
Here, take it.

01:25.389 --> 01:27.391
No. Owie!

01:27.529 --> 01:29.255
No, no, no,
show me the playroom.

01:31.361 --> 01:33.328
Wait, show your toys.

01:38.299 --> 01:40.301
Oh, it's okay, Caesar.

01:40.439 --> 01:41.854
Aw...

01:41.992 --> 01:43.925
I think Little Caesar's
tired out from the drive.

01:44.063 --> 01:45.927
- Aren't you, buddy?
- James?

01:46.065 --> 01:47.860
Why aren't there
any curtains upstairs?

01:47.998 --> 01:50.034
Because, babe,
we're in the middle of nowhere

01:50.173 --> 01:52.175
- and no one's watching.
- Say hi, Mommy.

01:52.313 --> 01:53.900
Hi, Junebug.

01:54.038 --> 01:55.937
Wait a minute,
I thought this was broken.

01:56.075 --> 01:57.559
No, baby, please be careful.

01:57.697 --> 01:59.906
I just don't want it
to break again.

02:00.044 --> 02:02.046
- Daddy fixed it.
- Yeah.

02:02.185 --> 02:04.256
We just wanna make sure
that we don't break it again.

02:04.394 --> 02:07.569
Well, then I'm just gonna
fix it again, aren't I?

02:07.707 --> 02:09.882
- What's that?
- James.

02:10.020 --> 02:11.780
It's just the altitude.
I'm fine.

02:11.918 --> 02:13.851
Why is your nose bleeding?

02:13.989 --> 02:15.888
- Daddy's fine.
- Are you okay?

02:57.550 --> 02:59.276
I just heard the news.

02:59.414 --> 03:02.555
Um, I can't imagine what
you must be going through.

03:02.693 --> 03:04.937
We really hate to see you go,
but I get it.

03:05.075 --> 03:06.835
You need a fresh start.

03:06.973 --> 03:08.389
I had no idea what you
were going through.

03:08.527 --> 03:11.288
Anyway, I'm just--
I'm so sorry.

03:11.426 --> 03:13.635
Call or text,
or whatever works.

03:13.773 --> 03:15.844
I know you are dealing
with a lot right now.

03:15.982 --> 03:18.985
Just-- We're gonna
miss you a lot.

03:19.123 --> 03:21.471
But you two
are gonna get through this.

03:21.609 --> 03:24.336
I'm here for you.
Someday she'll understand.

03:42.112 --> 03:43.941
Frightening developments
this morning

03:44.079 --> 03:45.322
as a green Toyota Camry--

03:48.152 --> 03:50.293
A recovery operation
is currently underway,

03:50.431 --> 03:51.294
but it's unclear--

03:54.952 --> 03:56.816
A shocking development today,

03:56.954 --> 03:59.163
as a vehicle
belonging to Ms. Kim

03:59.302 --> 04:02.408
was found dumped in a Bay Area
lake. The lead detective--

04:02.546 --> 04:03.547
Here.

04:05.653 --> 04:07.517
...Margot's father, David Kim.

04:07.655 --> 04:10.968
They found Ms. Kim's keychain
near the lake this morning.

05:02.675 --> 05:05.126
- Hello--?
- Siri, call June.

05:05.264 --> 05:06.610
- Oh, my gosh.
- Mom?

05:06.748 --> 05:08.232
Siri, please call Junebug.

05:08.371 --> 05:10.856
Mom, you're already
on the phone. This is FaceTime.

05:12.271 --> 05:14.377
Oh, gosh. Can you please
do me a favor

05:14.515 --> 05:15.930
and clear your voicemail?

05:16.068 --> 05:17.587
I've been trying
to leave you messages.

05:17.725 --> 05:19.105
Well, they're probably
all from you.

05:19.243 --> 05:20.452
You know you don't
have to use Siri

05:20.590 --> 05:21.694
for literally everything, right?

05:21.832 --> 05:23.109
Listen, I am running late

05:23.247 --> 05:24.835
and I need you to write
a couple of things down.

05:24.973 --> 05:26.423
The car keys are gonna be

05:26.561 --> 05:29.081
in the top drawer
in the kitchen, and Kevin--

05:29.219 --> 05:31.808
I just said write it down.
You're not writing it down.

05:34.811 --> 05:36.916
Kevin forwarded you
the itinerary.

05:37.054 --> 05:39.988
No alcohol, do not open the door
for strangers.

05:40.126 --> 05:43.613
And keep your location service
turned on

05:43.751 --> 05:47.202
the entire time I'm away,
do you understand?

05:47.340 --> 05:48.894
No fun. Got it.

05:49.032 --> 05:52.760
Uh, what about for like,
you know, food or whatever?

05:52.898 --> 05:54.727
I left a key with Heather.

05:54.865 --> 05:56.626
- Call her if you need anything.
- What?

05:56.764 --> 05:59.525
- No. Mom, I don't need Heather.
- What do you mean, "No"?

05:59.663 --> 06:01.493
I am 18.
I don't need a babysitter.

06:01.631 --> 06:04.012
I don't care if you're 18, okay?

06:04.150 --> 06:05.635
So you pick Heather,
of all people?

06:05.773 --> 06:07.878
You do not understand
the sacrifices I made

06:08.016 --> 06:10.640
- to give you the life you have.
- Mom, you're being so dramatic.

06:10.778 --> 06:12.814
Junebug, if you'd--Stop calling me that!

06:16.853 --> 06:21.271
I just-- I just need to know
that you're safe when I'm away.

06:24.170 --> 06:26.932
All right, Kevin's gonna
be there any minute

06:27.070 --> 06:28.071
to call the Uber.

06:28.209 --> 06:29.969
I also just deposited some money

06:30.107 --> 06:31.833
into your account
for emergencies.

06:31.971 --> 06:33.110
Understand?

06:35.043 --> 06:36.459
What's the money for?

06:37.460 --> 06:38.875
Emergencies.

06:39.013 --> 06:40.566
♪ Cop it, drop it, spend it ♪

06:40.704 --> 06:42.154
♪ Money not stopping... ♪

06:42.292 --> 06:43.535
You get it? Yep.

06:43.673 --> 06:45.191
Heading into
the store now. Bye!

06:46.503 --> 06:47.608
Knock, knock.

06:47.746 --> 06:49.851
Whoa.

06:49.989 --> 06:51.991
That cat just won't
come around.

06:52.129 --> 06:54.856
How's the old computer running?

06:54.994 --> 06:58.066
Oh, yeah. It's a little faster. Thanks.

06:58.204 --> 06:59.689
No problem, parcera.

06:59.827 --> 07:00.724
What?

07:00.862 --> 07:03.658
Uh... It's a Colombian thing.

07:03.796 --> 07:05.246
I'm working on my Spanish.

07:05.384 --> 07:06.799
Cool.

07:07.869 --> 07:09.733
Hey, um, I know you're in

07:09.871 --> 07:13.392
summer vacay mode,
but, uh, you have a sec?

07:18.708 --> 07:20.019
Uh...

07:21.365 --> 07:22.643
How do I say this?

07:25.611 --> 07:27.199
Look.

07:27.337 --> 07:30.961
I know that I'm just,

07:31.099 --> 07:33.757
I don't know,
the new guy to you.

07:33.895 --> 07:37.105
But I love your mom.

07:38.831 --> 07:43.733
And I know I planned this
for just me and her,

07:43.871 --> 07:46.218
but it's for
a very special reason.

07:46.356 --> 07:47.495
- Kev?
- So before we--

07:47.633 --> 07:49.014
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:49.152 --> 07:50.843
What's goin' on?

07:50.981 --> 07:53.294
June and I
were just chatting.

07:53.432 --> 07:55.192
Oh, okay.
Did you call the Uber?

07:55.330 --> 07:56.953
Two minutes away.
What?

07:57.091 --> 07:58.851
Do you wanna
take the bags down?

07:58.989 --> 08:00.612
It takes 30 seconds to wheel--

08:00.750 --> 08:01.889
I know, but I wanna talk...

08:02.027 --> 08:03.476
Okay, all right,
I'll see you out there.

08:03.615 --> 08:04.581
Thank you.

08:14.695 --> 08:15.592
Really?

08:17.283 --> 08:20.252
Look, I'm sorry if it seems
like I'm hard on you.

08:20.390 --> 08:22.634
But it really is
just to make sure you're safe.

08:22.772 --> 08:24.083
Uber's actually here!

08:24.221 --> 08:25.568
Okay, coming!

08:29.019 --> 08:31.090
June, listen to me.

08:31.228 --> 08:34.784
I need you to pick us up on
Monday at LAX. Can you do that?

08:36.061 --> 08:37.131
Yes, ma'am.

08:37.269 --> 08:38.408
Thank you.

Shit!

10:21.511 --> 10:22.823
Hey, Junie.

10:22.961 --> 10:24.169
Wasn't sure you'd be home.

10:24.307 --> 10:25.826
I brought some dinner for ya.

10:25.964 --> 10:27.517
Oh, relax.
How's it hangin'?

10:27.655 --> 10:29.346
Oh, it's-it's fine.

10:29.484 --> 10:31.245
Um... How was work?

10:31.383 --> 10:33.696
It was good. I won a custody
case for a client,

10:33.834 --> 10:35.387
so that's good.

10:35.525 --> 10:38.908
Uh... I bet your mom
already misses you.

10:39.046 --> 10:41.117
You know, Kevin sent me a
picture of them from the beach.

10:41.255 --> 10:42.463
He's been working out.

10:42.601 --> 10:44.051
Wait, Kevin's sending you
pictures?

10:44.189 --> 10:45.569
I'm just glad she found someone.

10:45.708 --> 10:48.676
Someone nice and cute,
cool tech job.

10:48.814 --> 10:52.059
I'd kill for a guy like that.
It's pretty rough out there.

10:52.197 --> 10:54.164
Not that I don't have my fun.
You know what I'm saying?

10:54.302 --> 10:55.821
Unfortunately.

10:55.959 --> 10:57.064
Is everything okay?

10:58.272 --> 11:00.792
Oh, yeah, yeah. It's fine.

11:00.930 --> 11:03.484
You know, I could stay
and hang if you're bored.

11:03.622 --> 11:07.108
No, it's okay. I'm just looking
forward to a quiet night in.

12:37.820 --> 12:39.511
Yo, June, you okay?

12:39.649 --> 12:42.100
Anybody seen my smartwatch?
It's square with--

12:42.238 --> 12:44.930
Okay. It's all right.
All right, listen to me.

12:45.068 --> 12:46.829
You're all right.
Tia, can you get the cup?

12:46.967 --> 12:47.864
All right, let's go.

12:48.002 --> 12:49.314
- You're done.
- I'm sorry.

12:49.452 --> 12:50.591
Okay, June, okay.

13:00.256 --> 13:03.742
Aw, I think Little Caesar's
tired out from the drive.

13:03.880 --> 13:05.537
- Aren't you, buddy?
- James?

13:05.675 --> 13:07.608
Why aren't there
any curtains upstairs?

13:07.746 --> 13:09.713
Because, babe,
we're in the middle of nowhere

13:09.852 --> 13:11.577
and no one's watching.

13:11.715 --> 13:13.717
Hi, Junebug.

13:13.856 --> 13:15.581
Wait a minute,
I thought this was broken.

13:15.719 --> 13:17.445
No, baby, please be careful.

13:17.583 --> 13:19.689
I just don't want it
to break again.

13:19.827 --> 13:21.898
- Daddy fixed it.
- Yeah.

13:22.036 --> 13:23.900
We just wanna make sure
that we don't break it again.

13:24.038 --> 13:26.006
Well, then I'm just
gonna fix it again.

14:43.876 --> 14:45.292
Oh, shit.

16:17.280 --> 16:20.283
Hi, this is Grace Allen.
Please leave a message.

16:20.421 --> 16:22.527
Mom?

16:22.665 --> 16:23.873
Where are you guys?

16:24.011 --> 16:25.564
I've been standing here forever.

16:27.049 --> 16:28.429
Let me know when you get this.

16:29.913 --> 16:32.364
See you in a sec. Bye.

17:05.742 --> 17:08.090
Hi. I'm calling about
a guest you had,

17:08.228 --> 17:10.471
seeing if they
extended their stay.

17:14.165 --> 17:16.684
Um... I'm sorry.

17:16.822 --> 17:19.653
Does anyone speak English?

17:19.791 --> 17:22.000
No, I'm sorry.

17:24.278 --> 17:27.902
Knew I shouldn't have dropped
Spanish. Um...

17:36.773 --> 17:39.259
Um... It's Lin.
It's spelled L-I--

17:39.397 --> 17:40.915
Oh, sí, Kevin Lin. Uh-huh.

17:41.053 --> 17:43.263
Yeah. That's him. Uh--

17:48.302 --> 17:49.855
Um...

17:49.993 --> 17:51.443
Uh--

17:53.514 --> 17:54.377
¿Qué?

18:02.005 --> 18:03.145
Wait, what?

18:04.353 --> 18:05.492
Um...

18:10.531 --> 18:11.843
Sí...

18:18.884 --> 18:19.885
What?

18:22.992 --> 18:24.476
Hello?

18:29.309 --> 18:30.482
No.

18:32.691 --> 18:34.624
Okay. Uh...

18:35.660 --> 18:37.351
Uh...

18:37.489 --> 18:38.801
Cameras.

18:48.155 --> 18:49.570
"En persona."

18:49.708 --> 18:51.193
I can't go in person.

18:57.785 --> 18:59.477
The footage overwrites.

19:08.417 --> 19:10.384
Okay. Uh--

19:10.522 --> 19:11.592
Gracias.

19:28.885 --> 19:31.336
Yes, ma'am. And no one knows
where they went.

19:33.856 --> 19:36.203
I understand. Yes. Thank you.

19:37.963 --> 19:39.896
So is the embassy
doing something?

19:40.034 --> 19:42.796
No, they're already closed.
That was a duty officer.

19:42.934 --> 19:44.832
She said to fill out a report,
and somebody would call us

19:44.970 --> 19:46.627
tomorrow
when the embassy opens.

19:46.765 --> 19:49.112
And what about the footage?
Won't that be too late?

19:50.528 --> 19:52.357
I know.

19:52.495 --> 19:56.258
I'll make some more calls.
Somebody's gotta be open 24/7.

19:58.915 --> 20:01.159
So I'll just fill out
this form and--

20:01.297 --> 20:02.643
Don't worry.

20:02.781 --> 20:04.645
I'm gonna come by first thing
tomorrow morning

20:04.783 --> 20:06.302
when the embassy opens, okay?

20:06.440 --> 20:07.924
We're gonna figure this out.

20:08.062 --> 20:09.271
Okay. Yeah.

20:10.444 --> 20:11.652
Thanks, Heather.

20:36.988 --> 20:39.715
Good morning. This is Assistant
Legal Attaché Elijah Park.

20:39.853 --> 20:42.131
Am I speaking with Ms. Allen?

20:43.615 --> 20:45.790
- Hello?
- Hi. Hi. Hello?

20:45.928 --> 20:48.310
Hi. Hi there. This is Elijah Park.

20:48.448 --> 20:49.966
I'm calling from
the U.S. Embassy in Colombia.

20:50.104 --> 20:52.244
I thought you guys opened
an hour ago.

20:52.383 --> 20:55.178
Sorry, I was on with
Ms. Damore.

20:55.317 --> 20:57.526
She mentioned you wanted
to speak with me

20:57.664 --> 20:59.321
about some footage?

20:59.459 --> 21:03.394
Yes. The security footage,
I put it all in the report...

21:03.532 --> 21:06.535
Great, I'll take a look.
Now, I'm here in Colombia,

21:06.673 --> 21:09.365
so I'll be acting as liaison
between you and local police.

21:09.503 --> 21:11.402
Did you not get my report?

21:11.540 --> 21:14.059
Um... Doesn't appear so.

21:14.197 --> 21:17.442
Great. Okay, well,
the hotel has security footage,

21:17.580 --> 21:19.064
but it constantly overwrites.

21:19.202 --> 21:23.103
So we have about six hours
until it's gone,

21:23.241 --> 21:26.071
so can you please send
an agent over?

21:26.209 --> 21:27.590
I'll do my best.

21:27.728 --> 21:30.213
But keep in mind, the FBI

21:30.352 --> 21:33.424
doesn't have jurisdiction
to investigate in Colombia.

21:33.562 --> 21:37.566
So it may take some time while
we work with local authorities.

21:39.084 --> 21:40.431
Great. Now, listen,

21:40.569 --> 21:42.191
what's even more helpful to us

21:42.329 --> 21:45.228
is any information
you can tell me about your mom.

21:45.367 --> 21:47.058
Did she say
or do anything unusual

21:47.196 --> 21:48.577
before she went missing?

21:48.715 --> 21:51.200
Could be a text, a voicemail.

21:51.338 --> 21:53.685
No, not really.

21:53.823 --> 21:54.893
Okay. That's okay.

21:55.031 --> 21:56.516
Um, and do you have access

21:56.654 --> 21:58.518
to anything we could use
to geolocate?

21:58.656 --> 22:01.175
Her Gmail, iCloud?

22:01.313 --> 22:03.039
Wait. Maybe...

22:10.806 --> 22:13.429
Now, listen, we can only use
evidence from accounts

22:13.567 --> 22:15.327
that you have legal access to.

22:15.466 --> 22:17.433
Otherwise nothing we learn
will be admissible in court.

22:17.571 --> 22:19.297
I think I might have something.

22:23.474 --> 22:24.440
Come on.

22:48.637 --> 22:51.433
Never mind.
Sorry, I don't have anything.

22:51.571 --> 22:53.952
That's okay.
Now, I know you're 18,

22:54.090 --> 22:56.955
but do you have relatives
that could come stay with you?

22:57.093 --> 22:59.786
No. Um...
It's just me and my mom.

22:59.924 --> 23:02.029
Heather is probably
gonna stop by.

23:02.167 --> 23:05.067
You are going to get
that footage, though, right?

23:05.205 --> 23:06.827
If you get that form in,

23:06.965 --> 23:09.830
I'll make sure it gets
to the right hands. Okay?

23:09.968 --> 23:11.383
We'll be in touch.

25:15.749 --> 25:17.164
Hi. Hello?

25:19.270 --> 25:21.341
Hi. Um...

25:21.479 --> 25:23.619
I think your sound is off.

25:27.450 --> 25:29.729
Oh, hi. Yes, yes. Hi, Javier.

25:37.012 --> 25:38.669
Signal okay now?

25:38.807 --> 25:40.325
The signal is great.
I need you--

25:40.463 --> 25:41.741
You are from where?

25:41.879 --> 25:43.501
I'm from Los Angeles. I need--

25:43.639 --> 25:44.847
Hollywood!

25:44.985 --> 25:46.262
Van Nuys.

25:46.400 --> 25:47.643
I need you to go to this hotel

25:47.781 --> 25:49.956
and ask for
their security footage.

25:50.094 --> 25:51.682
I'm tryna find someone.

25:51.820 --> 25:54.305
I don't understand.
"Tryna find."

25:54.443 --> 25:55.824
She's missing.

25:58.965 --> 26:00.000
How long?

26:00.138 --> 26:01.484
Like 36 hours.

26:01.623 --> 26:03.210
And I need someone
to get to the hotel

26:03.348 --> 26:05.627
and get the footage
before it's erased

26:05.765 --> 26:08.043
so we can see when she
and her boyfriend left.

26:08.181 --> 26:09.700
La policíawill not check?

26:09.838 --> 26:11.978
No. No, I mean,
they said they would try,

26:12.116 --> 26:14.118
but they can't even
investigate directly.

26:14.256 --> 26:15.982
So I need your help.

26:16.120 --> 26:17.673
Ah, lo siento, pero...

26:17.811 --> 26:20.469
I'm only services.
Cleaning, electric, you know.

26:20.607 --> 26:23.645
Please. Please, it's my mom.

26:26.268 --> 26:27.338
Please.

26:30.859 --> 26:32.895
You make me think of my son.

26:33.033 --> 26:34.586
Never taking no for an answer.

26:44.044 --> 26:46.046
Okay. Okay.

26:46.184 --> 26:47.530
Oh, man, thank you so much.

26:47.669 --> 26:49.912
Oh, June. Interesting thing.

26:50.050 --> 26:52.984
Did you know that your phones
are always tracking you?

26:53.122 --> 26:55.918
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

26:56.056 --> 26:58.887
But I can't get into her
accounts even if I wanted to.

26:59.025 --> 27:00.164
And did you try his?

27:01.130 --> 27:02.442
What?

27:02.580 --> 27:04.927
You said she's traveling
with her boyfriend.

27:05.065 --> 27:07.309
So if you can't find hers, maybe...

27:07.447 --> 27:08.897
Right.

27:13.695 --> 27:15.213
I can find him.

27:23.739 --> 27:25.085
- Yo.
- Hey, Vee.

27:25.223 --> 27:27.398
Thanks for coming by.
Heather never showed up.

27:27.536 --> 27:29.503
Of course. This is so crazy.

27:29.641 --> 27:33.611
Hey, I think Caesar's
eating your smartwatch.

27:33.749 --> 27:35.786
What?
I don't have a smartwatch.

27:35.924 --> 27:37.719
Anyway, does Kevin give you

27:37.857 --> 27:39.928
same-password-for-everything
type of vibe?

27:40.066 --> 27:41.723
Mm, 50-50.

27:43.794 --> 27:47.073
Actually, 60-40.
Why is your mom dating this guy?

27:47.211 --> 27:48.695
Heather thinks he's hot.

27:48.833 --> 27:50.214
Of course she does.

27:50.352 --> 27:52.112
So you're trying
to get his password?

27:52.250 --> 27:53.113
Yeah.

27:54.563 --> 27:55.909
Oh, yeah. This will work.

27:56.047 --> 27:57.566
Do you remember that time

27:57.704 --> 28:00.224
you impersonated the Postmates
driver on the phone?

28:00.362 --> 28:02.398
Dude, he had no idea.

28:02.536 --> 28:04.090
All right. I need your help.

28:05.747 --> 28:07.334
So to recover your password,

28:07.472 --> 28:09.336
I'll just have to verify
a couple things,

28:09.474 --> 28:11.407
starting with date of birth.

28:12.788 --> 28:14.410
November 10th, 1980.

28:14.548 --> 28:16.827
Great. And the last four
of your social.

28:18.449 --> 28:20.485
I don't give that out
on the phone.

28:20.623 --> 28:23.178
In that case,
your mother's maiden name.

28:23.316 --> 28:26.457
Uh-- Chen. Julia Chen.

28:26.595 --> 28:28.597
And the name
of your elementary school.

28:30.633 --> 28:33.602
Uh, the name
of my elementary school?

28:33.740 --> 28:34.948
Yup.

28:38.952 --> 28:40.057
Uh, sir?

28:40.195 --> 28:42.473
Do you need the full name
or...?

28:42.611 --> 28:44.716
Honestly, whatever works.

28:46.477 --> 28:49.066
Uh, Tillman Elementary?

29:00.974 --> 29:02.458
Oh, sweet, we're in.

29:05.634 --> 29:08.361
Okay. Let's see
where they were going.

29:14.816 --> 29:17.335
There's their Uber to LAX.

29:17.473 --> 29:19.682
Flight to Cartagena.

29:19.821 --> 29:22.030
Hotel.

29:22.168 --> 29:23.203
Wait.

29:25.688 --> 29:27.000
Maybe he didn't have service?

29:27.138 --> 29:29.934
But he was texting me
the whole time.

29:30.072 --> 29:32.316
Unless he turned off
his location.

29:34.905 --> 29:37.148
Bad news. The footage
is already gone.

29:38.563 --> 29:40.082
But interesting story.

29:40.220 --> 29:41.532
La señora que limpia,

29:41.670 --> 29:43.361
how do you say,
the cleaning señora,

29:43.499 --> 29:46.848
she went to school with my son.
And we got to talking--

29:46.986 --> 29:48.573
No, Javi, no time for stories.

29:48.711 --> 29:50.058
Hold on.

29:50.196 --> 29:52.370
So I explain to her
what I'm looking for,

29:52.508 --> 29:55.028
and she says she sees
two American tourists

29:55.166 --> 29:58.342
- leave on Friday.
- Wait, so she saw them leave.

29:58.480 --> 30:00.171
Now you have time
for the story, huh?

30:00.309 --> 30:02.933
So they're going to leave,
and your mother says sorry

30:03.071 --> 30:05.590
because she spilled some wine
on the bedsheets.

30:05.728 --> 30:07.592
This is like 1
in the afternoon.

30:07.730 --> 30:09.525
She dressed up very nice,

30:09.663 --> 30:12.045
so the señoraasked if they
were going somewhere fancy.

30:12.183 --> 30:14.358
And guess what your stepfather said.

30:14.496 --> 30:16.118
Ew, no, not my stepfather.

30:16.256 --> 30:19.604
Oh, all right.
But he says he wants to go to...

30:19.742 --> 30:24.437
how do you say, you know, store
where shovels and hammers--

30:24.575 --> 30:25.714
Wait, a hardware store?

30:25.852 --> 30:27.233
Sí,hardware store.

30:27.371 --> 30:28.820
On vacation.

30:28.959 --> 30:30.822
Did she say what store
they went to?

30:30.961 --> 30:32.790
No, she didn't ask.

30:32.928 --> 30:35.482
There's gotta be a way
to figure it out.

30:35.620 --> 30:38.451
Yo. Me llamo Veena.

30:38.589 --> 30:41.661
Hola. Mucho gusto. Javi.

30:42.800 --> 30:45.423
Credit card history.

30:45.561 --> 30:48.150
His purchases should have
a location attached to them.

30:58.057 --> 31:00.438
Boom. Kevin's last purchase.

31:00.576 --> 31:02.647
Same day they went missing.

31:02.785 --> 31:04.822
Getsemani. That's the store.

31:04.960 --> 31:08.653
No. Getsemani.
That's not a store.

31:08.791 --> 31:10.932
That's an area, muy turístico,

31:11.070 --> 31:12.761
where you go to pay too much
for drinks.

31:14.280 --> 31:16.178
Okay, well, I'm sending you

31:16.316 --> 31:18.870
all the hardware stores
in Getsemani.

31:19.009 --> 31:21.459
Talk to the workers,
see if they saw anything, okay?

31:21.597 --> 31:24.738
- Or maybe I just buy some gum.
- Huh?

31:24.876 --> 31:27.949
To see if the bank
code matches.

31:28.087 --> 31:30.710
Oh, my God. Yes, Javi. Yes.

31:30.848 --> 31:32.401
Okay, I'm sending you
the code now.

31:32.539 --> 31:35.197
June, eight stores
might take a few hours.

31:35.335 --> 31:36.543
Is that okay with you?

31:36.681 --> 31:38.407
For now.

31:38.545 --> 31:40.547
I'll look through
his emails too,

31:40.685 --> 31:41.963
see if there's a receipt
in there.

31:42.101 --> 31:43.102
Okay.

31:44.620 --> 31:45.621
Here we go, then.

31:47.865 --> 31:49.418
You're going through
his email?

31:49.556 --> 31:51.317
- Yeah, so?
- So you can't

31:51.455 --> 31:53.871
break into Kevin's email
without permission.

31:54.009 --> 31:55.838
But why would he turn off
his locations?

31:55.977 --> 31:57.116
That doesn't make sense.

31:57.254 --> 31:58.703
I don't know,

31:58.841 --> 32:01.120
but you need to let the police
handle this stuff.

32:03.915 --> 32:06.125
Um, are you coming over?

32:06.263 --> 32:08.299
I'm sorry.
I gotta go into the office.

32:08.437 --> 32:09.887
I had to change
a client meeting.

32:10.025 --> 32:11.406
But I'll be there.

32:14.961 --> 32:16.790
- Whoa.
- What? What is it?

32:19.034 --> 32:21.312
Um, sorry, Heather, I gotta go.

32:22.451 --> 32:25.075
No match yet. Six more to go.

32:25.213 --> 32:26.386
Wait, wait, hold up.

32:27.732 --> 32:30.770
I-I think Kevin was cheating.

32:30.908 --> 32:32.185
"Sheeting"?

32:32.323 --> 32:34.153
He clearly has a type.

32:36.914 --> 32:38.743
What if you checked
his blocked users?

32:38.881 --> 32:41.056
- His what?
- In his contacts.

32:41.194 --> 32:43.196
Remember that one Unfiction
episode with the affair?

32:49.720 --> 32:50.893
Whoa.

32:52.723 --> 32:54.587
Who are these people?

32:58.418 --> 32:59.523
What the hell?

32:59.661 --> 33:01.456
Wait. Who's Greg?

33:01.594 --> 33:03.734
Hey, what's going on?

33:08.497 --> 33:10.706
This woman calls him Darren.

33:18.852 --> 33:21.338
They all want their money back.

33:41.599 --> 33:43.187
Yo.

33:43.325 --> 33:45.120
Dude's not cheating. He's a...

33:45.258 --> 33:46.466
He's a con man.

33:48.710 --> 33:51.713
Three years
in Eastham Federal Prison.

33:51.851 --> 33:53.266
Released last year.

33:53.404 --> 33:54.543
So you weren't gonna tell me

33:54.681 --> 33:56.580
my mom was dating a felon?

33:56.718 --> 33:59.686
Look, don't get me wrong.
We are looking into him.

33:59.824 --> 34:01.792
But he's never been involved
in a disappearance.

34:01.930 --> 34:04.139
And he's been using
his legal name.

34:04.277 --> 34:07.004
But don't you think this is
a pretty big coincidence?

34:07.142 --> 34:08.937
Keep in mind
that all of these cases

34:09.075 --> 34:10.835
were from before
his prison sentence.

34:10.973 --> 34:12.492
And he's never
violated parole.

34:12.630 --> 34:13.838
Okay.

34:13.976 --> 34:15.944
But what about
that Bunny Cake girl?

34:16.082 --> 34:18.015
- That's from this year.
- I understand,

34:18.153 --> 34:20.949
but right now you are illegally
accessing Mr. Lin's account.

34:21.087 --> 34:23.676
So any evidence that I receive
from that gets tossed in court.

34:25.264 --> 34:26.817
Look, I appreciate the help.

34:26.955 --> 34:28.646
But our job is to find your mom

34:28.784 --> 34:31.304
and build a prosecutable case
if there's a crime.

34:31.442 --> 34:34.031
So we gotta do this
the right way.

34:34.169 --> 34:36.344
You need to trust me on this.

34:53.154 --> 34:54.569
Uh, yeah, she works here.

34:54.707 --> 34:56.329
And you haven't
heard from her at all?

34:56.467 --> 34:58.780
Nope.
I've tried calling, DMing her.

34:58.918 --> 35:00.506
I've been stuck
covering her shift

35:00.644 --> 35:02.473
for the last two weeks, so...

35:02.611 --> 35:04.234
- Two weeks.
- Not exactly

35:04.372 --> 35:06.753
out of character, though.
She's... special.

35:06.891 --> 35:09.722
Do you mind calling if you hear
from her? It's important.

35:09.860 --> 35:11.724
Uh-- Sure.

35:11.862 --> 35:13.553
Bunny Cake is missing too.

35:13.691 --> 35:16.038
She hasn't been to work
in two weeks.

35:16.177 --> 35:17.661
You think he did
something to her?

35:17.799 --> 35:18.903
I don't know.

35:20.388 --> 35:22.424
But I know how to find out.

35:22.562 --> 35:24.392
I thought he turned
his location off.

35:24.530 --> 35:26.359
Not till they got to Colombia.

35:28.706 --> 35:30.329
Whoa.

35:30.467 --> 35:32.331
He wasseeing her.

35:34.781 --> 35:36.127
What were you up to?

35:41.340 --> 35:42.375
Huh...

35:46.552 --> 35:47.794
What the hell?

36:02.326 --> 36:04.639
And you got this number how?

36:04.777 --> 36:06.779
I'm calling about Kevin Lin.

36:06.917 --> 36:08.815
He visited your house
like two weeks ago.

36:08.953 --> 36:10.886
Wait, slow down. Kevin?

36:11.024 --> 36:13.717
Kevin Lin.
He was at your house...

36:15.063 --> 36:17.134
June 8th.
What was he doing there?

36:17.272 --> 36:18.618
Look, I don't
wanna say anything

36:18.756 --> 36:20.171
that he doesn't want public.

36:20.310 --> 36:22.277
Oh, so you're trying
to cover for him?

36:22.415 --> 36:24.486
Covering for wha--?
Of course not.

36:24.624 --> 36:27.420
Then why was he at your house?

36:31.044 --> 36:33.530
It's a reentry program
for ex-offenders.

36:33.668 --> 36:36.498
I was paired with Kevin
before I moved out here.

36:36.636 --> 36:38.086
He comes and visits sometimes.

36:39.674 --> 36:41.400
Look, the hardest part
for these guys

36:41.538 --> 36:45.300
is getting past the stigma,
so I try to be careful.

36:45.438 --> 36:47.164
Yeah, totally.

36:47.302 --> 36:49.511
And did he ever...

36:49.649 --> 36:52.652
mention my mom anytime?

36:52.790 --> 36:54.482
Mention?

36:54.620 --> 36:57.830
I mean, he hasn't shut up about
her since they first met.

36:57.968 --> 36:59.935
She seemed
really good for him.

37:00.073 --> 37:02.144
Yeah, um...

37:02.283 --> 37:03.905
Do you remember how they met?

37:04.043 --> 37:06.114
I mean, you'd know
better than me.

37:07.426 --> 37:08.289
Yeah.

37:09.428 --> 37:11.464
Um, you don't think this was

37:11.602 --> 37:13.708
just another one of his,
you know...

37:13.846 --> 37:15.951
Oh, no. I mean, look.

37:16.089 --> 37:19.645
Kevin's worked really hard
to put that stuff behind him.

37:19.783 --> 37:21.440
It seemed real to me.

37:21.578 --> 37:22.441
Yeah.

37:24.132 --> 37:25.996
And you said your name was Jim?

37:26.134 --> 37:27.446
Jimmy, yeah.

37:27.584 --> 37:29.033
Listen, I'll talk to the wife.

37:29.171 --> 37:31.864
I'll, uh, see
if she remembers anything.

37:32.002 --> 37:33.659
Good luck, June.

37:33.797 --> 37:35.281
Okay. Thanks, Jimmy.

37:47.466 --> 37:48.915
Is this the store?

37:49.053 --> 37:51.746
Do you know how many packs
of gum I bought today?

37:51.884 --> 37:53.541
Did anyone see them?

37:53.679 --> 37:55.370
No one remembers.

37:55.508 --> 37:57.407
But I got the receipt.

37:57.545 --> 38:00.686
Wait, you got it?
What did he buy?

38:01.997 --> 38:03.240
Just this.

38:04.724 --> 38:06.277
A lock?

38:06.416 --> 38:08.383
Why would he buy a lock?

38:08.521 --> 38:10.627
And what about
security cameras?

38:10.765 --> 38:11.662
No.

38:18.876 --> 38:20.222
So, what's next?

38:20.361 --> 38:22.432
Hey. I gotta bounce.

38:22.570 --> 38:24.572
I'll see you tomorrow, though.

38:24.710 --> 38:27.575
Oh. Okay. Yeah, sounds good.

38:29.024 --> 38:30.992
Hasta luego, Javi.

38:31.130 --> 38:32.649
Adiós, Veena.

38:36.929 --> 38:39.207
I hope I didn't waste
your money.

38:39.345 --> 38:41.451
No. No, Javi.

38:41.589 --> 38:43.211
You've been really helpful.

38:45.386 --> 38:47.733
Maybe you should tell
la policíaabout the lock.

38:47.871 --> 38:49.804
They maybe know something.

38:49.942 --> 38:51.737
Sure thing.

38:51.875 --> 38:53.394
Peace, Javi.

38:53.532 --> 38:54.947
Piece of what?

38:55.085 --> 38:57.950
No, like peace.

38:58.088 --> 39:00.608
- Ah.
- Just means goodbye.

39:02.437 --> 39:04.439
Text if you need anything.

40:54.480 --> 40:55.550
Hey, Grace!

40:57.863 --> 41:00.037
Sorry, I didn't mean
to say it that loud.

41:00.175 --> 41:02.937
Um... Kevin here.

41:03.075 --> 41:06.457
And I thought I'd just
try to get things started.

41:06.596 --> 41:08.218
Um...

41:08.356 --> 41:10.185
What's your favorite '80s band?

41:22.025 --> 41:23.923
I know, a third message
is lame.

41:24.061 --> 41:25.684
But you seem great,

41:25.822 --> 41:28.928
and I'd love
to know more about you.

41:29.066 --> 41:30.930
Also, hello.

41:31.068 --> 41:32.553
I forgot that. Okay.

41:37.385 --> 41:39.801
I certainly admire
your persistence.

41:39.939 --> 41:41.527
So, what would you
like to know?

41:46.774 --> 41:48.189
Believe it or not,
back in the day,

41:48.327 --> 41:51.606
I used to be a huge fan of...

41:53.194 --> 41:54.436
New Edition.

41:54.575 --> 41:56.680
Okay.

41:56.818 --> 41:58.786
You totally stole my answer.

42:09.451 --> 42:12.040
I'm kind of
a social media guy cliché.

42:12.178 --> 42:14.284
Shared office space.

42:14.422 --> 42:17.528
Uh-- There's beer on tap.

42:17.667 --> 42:20.980
I don't drink anymore, though,
really. Guess I'm gettin' old.

42:23.776 --> 42:25.019
Hi. Heh.

42:25.157 --> 42:26.676
I'm just getting home.

42:26.814 --> 42:29.161
Um... Another 13-hour day.

42:29.299 --> 42:31.819
You know what, Grace? It sounds
like you need a vacation.

42:31.957 --> 42:35.167
Just get off the grid,
do a hard reset.

42:35.305 --> 42:37.618
That's what works for me.

42:37.756 --> 42:40.482
Hey, Siri, can we take a vac--?
Oh, crap.

42:40.621 --> 42:43.313
"Hey, Siri, can
we take a vaca--?"

42:45.833 --> 42:48.421
Hey, Siri, remind me
to ask Grace out to dinner.

42:48.559 --> 42:49.802
Uh...

42:49.940 --> 42:51.010
Wait...

42:51.148 --> 42:52.633
Is this recording?

42:54.704 --> 42:56.188
Guess what this song is called.

42:56.326 --> 42:57.499
Last night was fun.

43:09.373 --> 43:10.892
I just don't know what to do.

43:11.030 --> 43:13.550
I tried to leave a voicemail.
Her voicemail is full.

43:13.688 --> 43:16.380
She turned off
location services.

43:16.518 --> 43:20.108
And she knows that
she's supposed to be home at 11.

43:20.246 --> 43:21.489
She knows this.

43:21.627 --> 43:24.147
Hey. She's almost 18.

43:25.976 --> 43:30.187
If she took the time
to turn off locations,

43:30.325 --> 43:31.533
she's probably okay.

43:31.672 --> 43:32.811
I know, I just...

43:32.949 --> 43:35.572
I don't know. She's--

43:35.710 --> 43:38.057
When I look at her, I just...

43:38.195 --> 43:40.715
I just see her father,
and it's like...

43:46.652 --> 43:49.551
We've really been through
a lot together.

43:53.555 --> 43:56.213
And I just don't think
that I could, uh...

43:59.285 --> 44:01.149
I don't think that I could
forgive myself

44:01.287 --> 44:03.807
if anything ever happened
to her, you know?

44:03.945 --> 44:06.637
You seem like
a really great mom.

44:08.294 --> 44:11.435
One day,
she'll get that.

44:39.532 --> 44:42.535
Uh-- So actually,
I've got stuff too.

44:46.298 --> 44:47.713
I have a record.

44:49.301 --> 44:52.304
And I shoulda told you earlier.

44:52.442 --> 44:54.755
But I just--
I really...

44:56.066 --> 44:57.343
I really like you,

44:57.481 --> 45:00.830
and I just didn't wanna
screw this up.

45:00.968 --> 45:05.455
But if you don't wanna
keep talking,

45:05.593 --> 45:08.009
I totally get it. Um...

45:10.632 --> 45:11.702
So...

45:11.841 --> 45:12.911
So yeah.

46:31.886 --> 46:33.301
"G-A, K-L."

46:33.439 --> 46:34.889
¿Sí?

46:35.027 --> 46:35.959
Yeah.

46:37.167 --> 46:38.341
There it is.

46:40.861 --> 46:42.621
There it is.

46:42.759 --> 46:44.865
I should have thought
of this place.

46:45.003 --> 46:47.557
Lots of tourists.
And good for couples.

46:52.562 --> 46:53.597
Hold on a sec.

47:02.123 --> 47:03.021
There.

47:08.958 --> 47:10.269
Javi, can you wave for me?

47:10.407 --> 47:11.443
¿Qué?

47:11.581 --> 47:12.478
Wave.

47:15.965 --> 47:17.449
I see you.

47:17.587 --> 47:19.313
Hey, June!

47:19.451 --> 47:21.729
Okay, let me check the archive.

47:32.567 --> 47:34.431
Come on, come on, come on.

47:35.605 --> 47:36.537
Wait.

47:37.572 --> 47:38.470
There!

47:40.196 --> 47:41.231
Do you see them?

47:43.751 --> 47:44.752
Yeah.

47:49.619 --> 47:51.069
He has the lock.

47:57.075 --> 47:58.421
Wait.

47:58.559 --> 48:01.458
Wait, he's pulling something
out of his pocket.

48:11.641 --> 48:12.883
What?

48:25.344 --> 48:26.794
It was real.

48:31.350 --> 48:32.765
Is everything all right?

48:34.250 --> 48:35.803
Um, yeah. Let me call you back.

48:37.529 --> 48:39.151
Ms. Allen?
We may have found them.

48:39.289 --> 48:41.671
I know they were at the bridge.
You were right.

48:41.809 --> 48:43.638
He wasn't trying to con her. Ms. Allen.

48:43.776 --> 48:45.364
Yeah?

48:45.502 --> 48:47.194
Listen.

48:47.332 --> 48:48.850
We've got some bad news.

49:00.793 --> 49:01.829
Oh, my God.

49:06.144 --> 49:07.697
Who are these people?

49:07.835 --> 49:09.112
We don't know.

49:09.250 --> 49:10.769
We just received this
this morning

49:10.907 --> 49:12.115
from an anonymous source.

49:12.253 --> 49:13.220
We're mobilizing units

49:13.358 --> 49:15.084
across the city as we speak.

49:15.222 --> 49:17.396
What are they gonna do to her?

49:17.534 --> 49:19.398
Well, we flagged a withdrawal

49:19.536 --> 49:21.883
from your mom's bank to an
encrypted third-party account,

49:22.022 --> 49:23.713
so they may just want money.

49:23.851 --> 49:26.440
So, what now?
Is there anything I can do?

49:26.578 --> 49:29.374
Hey, we're gonna find
these guys, okay?

49:29.512 --> 49:31.031
The best thing you can do
to help us

49:31.169 --> 49:32.687
is just wait by your phone.

49:32.825 --> 49:33.930
We'll be in touch.

49:35.897 --> 49:37.278
They said something about money,

49:37.416 --> 49:38.831
but what if these people
hurt her?

49:38.969 --> 49:40.178
They have no reason to.

49:40.316 --> 49:42.214
I've already lost one parent, Javi.

49:42.352 --> 49:43.595
I can't lose her too.

49:46.667 --> 49:48.358
I didn't even say goodbye.

49:56.573 --> 49:58.575
When did you lose your father?

50:00.681 --> 50:02.924
I-I'm sorry if you don't
wanna talk about it.

50:03.063 --> 50:04.892
No, it's fine. Um...

50:05.755 --> 50:07.619
It was years ago.

50:09.241 --> 50:11.312
I can't even remember
the funeral.

50:13.935 --> 50:17.974
My son Carlos lost his mom
when he was very young too.

50:18.112 --> 50:19.493
That's why I ask.

50:20.666 --> 50:21.805
I know it's hard.

50:21.943 --> 50:23.186
Yeah.

50:23.324 --> 50:26.189
Your son is lucky
he still has you, Javi.

50:26.327 --> 50:27.225
Hm.

50:28.571 --> 50:29.641
I don't know.

50:31.574 --> 50:32.678
What do you mean?

50:34.232 --> 50:35.854
He was always trouble.

50:35.992 --> 50:37.269
But the trouble got worse,

50:37.407 --> 50:39.720
then one day we had
this big fight and...

50:43.068 --> 50:46.589
He said he never wanted
to talk to me again.

50:46.727 --> 50:48.211
I guess he meant it.

50:51.076 --> 50:54.010
But, you know, even if
he doesn't want to see me,

50:54.148 --> 50:55.598
he's always mi Carlito.

50:56.806 --> 50:58.118
And whatever you are

50:58.256 --> 51:00.741
beating yourself over
with your mom...

51:02.846 --> 51:04.607
it doesn't change
a parent's love.

51:04.745 --> 51:05.677
I know.

51:08.438 --> 51:10.130
Have you tried reaching out?

51:11.545 --> 51:12.718
To your son?

51:17.689 --> 51:19.139
He knows where I am.

51:24.523 --> 51:26.076
Well, anyway, um...

51:28.700 --> 51:31.910
I don't wanna take
any more of your time, Javi.

51:32.048 --> 51:33.808
- Thank you.
- It's no problem, June.

51:33.946 --> 51:35.776
Call anytime.

51:35.914 --> 51:38.848
And, listen,
they're gonna find her.

51:38.986 --> 51:39.883
I know.

51:41.609 --> 51:43.646
- Peace, amiga.
- Hm?

51:45.026 --> 51:46.027
Peace.

53:49.254 --> 53:50.428
Oh, my God.

54:15.349 --> 54:17.040
Good morning.

54:17.178 --> 54:20.458
I'm Elijah Park with the FBI.

54:20.596 --> 54:24.703
Last evening we determined
that U.S. citizen Grace Allen,

54:24.841 --> 54:26.705
previously thought
to have been kidnapped

54:26.843 --> 54:28.604
here in Cartagena, Colombia,

54:28.742 --> 54:30.675
was in fact impersonated

54:30.813 --> 54:34.575
in an alleged scheme
by the suspects behind me.

54:34.713 --> 54:38.579
We are now turning to
the public for any information

54:38.717 --> 54:41.513
regarding the whereabouts
of Miss Allen,

54:41.651 --> 54:43.032
who we now believe...

54:44.413 --> 54:45.897
never left Los Angeles.

54:48.900 --> 54:50.419
Hi, everybody,
first up this morning:

54:50.557 --> 54:52.731
"The strangest case
I've ever seen."

54:52.869 --> 54:56.425
Those are the words used
by LAPD Detective Luciana Gomez

54:56.563 --> 54:59.117
to describe the disappearance
of a Van Nuys resident

54:59.255 --> 55:01.361
who was seemingly swapped out

55:01.499 --> 55:04.536
with another woman
along their Uber drive to LAX.

55:04.674 --> 55:06.538
Because of
the staged kidnapping,

55:06.676 --> 55:08.022
we've lost a lot of time.

55:08.160 --> 55:09.955
It's now been over a week

55:10.093 --> 55:13.718
since Miss Allen was last seen,
so we need to move quickly.

55:13.856 --> 55:15.892
A ground search begins today

55:16.030 --> 55:18.308
for a woman
police say went missing

55:18.447 --> 55:22.727
somewhere along her nearly
22-mile trip to the airport.

55:24.280 --> 55:25.592
Grace!

55:25.730 --> 55:26.938
Grace!

55:27.076 --> 55:28.802
Grace!

55:28.940 --> 55:30.493
Grace!

55:34.324 --> 55:36.465
They were talking to you
for a while. They know anything?

55:36.603 --> 55:38.018
They think whatever happened

55:38.156 --> 55:39.847
must have been
on the drive to LAX.

55:39.985 --> 55:42.263
Right, right, right.
Look at this. Look at 'em.

55:44.265 --> 55:47.855
So your mom gets in the Uber,
they take the 405,

55:47.993 --> 55:51.272
and then a totally different
woman gets out at LAX.

55:51.411 --> 55:54.897
If Kevin did something to her,
that's when it happened.

55:55.035 --> 55:56.485
The weird thing is,

55:56.623 --> 56:00.074
he only ever stopped
for three minutes along the way.

56:00.212 --> 56:02.767
He must have had help.

56:02.905 --> 56:05.079
Uber has no record of the trip,

56:05.217 --> 56:06.840
and the car was using
stolen plates.

56:06.978 --> 56:08.807
We got an APB out
for the vehicle now.

56:08.945 --> 56:10.671
Yep. Down in front.

56:10.809 --> 56:13.260
Is it possible
that the Uber driver was hired?

56:13.398 --> 56:14.572
It's possible.

56:14.710 --> 56:16.643
According to our friends
at the FBI...

56:16.781 --> 56:18.334
Large withdrawals
from Miss Allen's bank account

56:18.472 --> 56:20.025
were made
after her disappearance.

56:20.163 --> 56:22.890
In the meantime, the one person
who knows for sure

56:23.028 --> 56:23.857
what's going on here...

56:23.995 --> 56:25.583
Is Mr. Lin.

56:25.721 --> 56:27.964
So we're working with
the police around the region,

56:28.102 --> 56:30.933
including officers
at the Venezuelan border.

56:31.071 --> 56:32.037
We find him...

56:32.175 --> 56:33.832
And we find Grace Allen.

56:37.353 --> 56:38.975
Javi, what are they saying?

56:39.113 --> 56:42.841
They say that the police
arrested some local students

56:42.979 --> 56:46.466
that Lin hired
to be part of a movie.

56:54.025 --> 56:55.475
Whoa. June,
check this out.

56:55.613 --> 56:56.476
Huh?

56:58.547 --> 57:00.514
They're arresting her.
Right now.

57:00.652 --> 57:02.620
There she is. There, there.

57:02.758 --> 57:04.553
No, no, no. Can you see her?

57:04.691 --> 57:05.692
What?

57:07.625 --> 57:09.558
Aspiring actress Rachel Page,

57:09.696 --> 57:12.319
recently detained upon
reentering the U.S.,

57:12.457 --> 57:15.702
was released today on bail
as a cooperating witness.

57:17.220 --> 57:18.808
He said it was a reality show.

57:19.878 --> 57:22.881
Like a lifestyle travel thing,

57:23.019 --> 57:25.366
all shot on a iPhone and stuff.

57:25.505 --> 57:28.715
I had to walk a certain way,
dress a certain way.

57:28.853 --> 57:31.407
And I couldn't even post
anything on Instagram.

57:33.858 --> 57:36.999
But after the kidnapping scene,

57:38.241 --> 57:39.864
I knew something was up.

57:40.002 --> 57:41.624
So I made a run for it.

57:41.762 --> 57:45.110
But there was no crew,
no real cameras.

57:45.248 --> 57:47.250
None of that seemed odd?

57:47.388 --> 57:48.976
I just thought:

57:49.114 --> 57:51.910
"Damn. This guy has a vision."

57:54.499 --> 57:55.604
How do you know she's not lying?

57:55.742 --> 57:57.329
Miss Page said Kevin
and his driver

57:57.467 --> 57:58.710
picked her up near the 405,

57:58.848 --> 58:01.264
so LAPD checked traffic cameras.

58:01.402 --> 58:04.233
By the time Kevin got there,
your mom was already gone.

58:04.371 --> 58:06.097
Miss Page never saw her.

58:06.235 --> 58:08.720
Okay, well, did she get
a good look at the driver?

58:08.858 --> 58:11.930
Middle-aged, baseball hat,
that's all we got.

58:12.068 --> 58:14.588
She couldn't see his face
from the back seat.

58:14.726 --> 58:16.625
Yo, Kevin for sure
hired that guy.

58:16.763 --> 58:18.281
Veena, shut up.

58:18.419 --> 58:19.766
I'm sorry.

58:19.904 --> 58:21.906
Listen, Miss Allen,
while I have you,

58:22.044 --> 58:24.805
I have some questions regarding
something we're looking into.

58:24.943 --> 58:26.186
Okay.

58:26.324 --> 58:27.463
You mentioned that you don't

58:27.601 --> 58:28.878
have any extended family, right?

58:29.016 --> 58:30.017
No.

58:30.155 --> 58:31.363
To the best of your knowledge,

58:31.501 --> 58:33.952
your mom has never gone
by any other names?

58:34.090 --> 58:37.507
No. She's just Grace Allen. Why?

58:41.235 --> 58:44.998
Exclusive developments tonight
in the case of Grace Allen:

58:45.136 --> 58:47.483
Public records suggesting
there may be more

58:47.621 --> 58:50.659
to the missing Van Nuys resident
than meets the eye.

58:50.797 --> 58:53.351
Turns out Grace Allen
is just one

58:53.489 --> 58:55.802
of the mystery woman's aliases,

58:55.940 --> 59:00.013
whose real identity lies locked
behind a court-ordered seal.

59:00.151 --> 59:02.256
You're her lawyer.
There's nothing you can do?

59:02.394 --> 59:04.431
It's a court-ordered seal.

59:04.569 --> 59:07.676
It's gonna take at least a week
to get a judge to lift it.

59:07.814 --> 59:10.817
And she never said
anything to you about this?

59:10.955 --> 59:12.059
I don't...

59:13.371 --> 59:14.752
No, I don't think so.

59:17.099 --> 59:19.895
Why would she
keep this from me?

59:20.033 --> 59:23.174
Does this suggest Grace Allen
herself might be implicated?

59:23.312 --> 59:24.658
Let me be clear:

59:24.796 --> 59:28.179
Right now,
Grace Allen is not a suspect.

59:28.317 --> 59:31.009
That being said,
we can't rule anything out.

59:35.462 --> 59:37.257
Hi, is this June Allen?

59:37.395 --> 59:39.535
I'm an executive at Netflix,
and we'd love to talk to you.

59:39.673 --> 59:41.571
...calling in for my podcast
on Spotify--

59:41.710 --> 59:43.470
I tried leaving a voicemail.
I'm writing an article--

59:43.608 --> 59:44.885
Yo, it's Angel.

59:45.023 --> 59:46.853
Just checking in
on things with your mom.

59:46.991 --> 59:49.545
Also, did you find my watch?

59:49.683 --> 59:51.927
So the missing money
wasn't stolen.

59:52.065 --> 59:54.584
It was payment to Kevin
for helping her disappear.

59:54.723 --> 59:55.827
Why else would she--

59:55.965 --> 59:58.002
She hired Lin and the driver,

59:58.140 --> 59:59.866
stages the kidnapping,

1:00:00.004 --> 1:00:02.247
hides in the trunk, drives off,
starts a new life somewhere.

1:00:02.385 --> 1:00:04.387
Which we know she's done
once before.

1:00:04.525 --> 1:00:06.527
I mean, zero known
family members,

1:00:06.666 --> 1:00:08.046
other than the daughter?

1:00:08.184 --> 1:00:09.669
That's hella sus.

1:00:11.325 --> 1:00:14.087
I cannot take this anymore!

1:00:14.225 --> 1:00:15.571
It's just the Internet, June.

1:00:15.709 --> 1:00:17.642
No, no, it's not
just the Internet.

1:00:17.780 --> 1:00:19.092
It's the police too.

1:00:19.230 --> 1:00:21.922
Hey, hey, hey.
It's going to be okay, June.

1:00:22.060 --> 1:00:24.200
Don't let them put you down.

1:00:39.250 --> 1:00:40.976
How many tax dollars
have been wasted

1:00:41.114 --> 1:00:43.116
searching for someone
who clearly ran away?

1:00:43.254 --> 1:00:45.566
I mean,
her coworker described her

1:00:45.705 --> 1:00:47.499
as dodgy
and guarded about her past.

1:00:47.637 --> 1:00:49.501
How can people
believe any of this?

1:00:49.639 --> 1:00:51.607
They're focusing
on the wrong person.

1:00:51.745 --> 1:00:53.851
At least
they're trying to help.

1:00:53.989 --> 1:00:56.336
Like, imagine if this
was an Unfictionepisode.

1:00:56.474 --> 1:00:59.857
You'd be asking questions
too, no?

1:00:59.995 --> 1:01:02.549
About Kevin. Not my mom.

1:01:02.687 --> 1:01:05.310
Yeah, but even you said she was
hiding something, right?

1:01:05.448 --> 1:01:07.450
She knew about Kevin
the whole time.

1:01:07.588 --> 1:01:09.038
Plus the whole
identity change--

1:01:09.176 --> 1:01:10.212
Veena, what the hell?

1:01:12.041 --> 1:01:14.423
No, I just mean that there are
some legit questions.

1:01:14.561 --> 1:01:16.632
There are no questions!

1:01:16.770 --> 1:01:19.704
This is not a show,
this is my mom!

1:01:19.842 --> 1:01:21.533
June, obviously I--

1:01:21.671 --> 1:01:22.880
You should just go.

1:05:15.975 --> 1:05:18.460
She was messaging Kevin
less than 24 hours ago.

1:05:18.598 --> 1:05:20.358
Plus she's been ignoring me
since they went missing.

1:05:20.496 --> 1:05:23.741
Breathe. Just breathe.
Maybe there is a good answer.

1:05:23.879 --> 1:05:26.123
And she's been obsessed with
Kevin ever since they met.

1:05:26.261 --> 1:05:28.228
It's all making sense.

1:05:28.366 --> 1:05:30.023
- What is that?
- It has a camera.

1:05:30.161 --> 1:05:31.645
This way,
she won't know I'm recording.

1:05:31.783 --> 1:05:33.751
June, if you think
something is wrong,

1:05:33.889 --> 1:05:36.650
- you need to tell la policía.
- I have tried!

1:05:36.788 --> 1:05:40.240
I have tried telling them about
Kevin and about Rachel.

1:05:40.378 --> 1:05:43.140
But anything I find on Kevin's
account can't be used

1:05:43.278 --> 1:05:46.246
to help "build a prosecutable
case" or whatever,

1:05:46.384 --> 1:05:47.696
so I have to record her.

1:05:47.834 --> 1:05:49.422
I'm syncing to the watch now.

1:05:49.560 --> 1:05:51.596
I need you to stay on the phone
while I'm in there

1:05:51.734 --> 1:05:53.529
in case something happens.

1:05:53.667 --> 1:05:54.703
June, I'm sorry.

1:05:54.841 --> 1:05:56.118
It's too dangerous.

1:05:56.256 --> 1:05:57.878
No, the police are acting like

1:05:58.017 --> 1:05:59.777
my mom's some kind
of criminal mastermind.

1:05:59.915 --> 1:06:04.333
Peromaybe right now
you need to trust them.

1:06:05.817 --> 1:06:07.233
What are you saying?

1:06:07.371 --> 1:06:09.649
Just because someone
is your parent,

1:06:09.787 --> 1:06:12.272
it doesn't mean
they do not make mistakes.

1:06:12.410 --> 1:06:13.411
Oh.

1:06:15.034 --> 1:06:16.828
I guess you would know, huh?

1:06:18.658 --> 1:06:21.695
Maybe you gave up
on your son...

1:06:21.833 --> 1:06:23.663
but I'm not giving up
on my mom.

1:06:46.548 --> 1:06:48.515
It's June 27th, 10 p.m.,

1:06:48.653 --> 1:06:53.002
at the office of Heather Damore,
73815 Wilshire Boulevard.

1:07:07.914 --> 1:07:09.674
Approaching her office now.

1:07:18.269 --> 1:07:20.271
Heather?

1:07:20.409 --> 1:07:21.928
Heather, it's June!

1:07:23.274 --> 1:07:24.793
Heather,
I saw your car out there.

1:07:24.931 --> 1:07:25.794
I know you're--

1:07:33.284 --> 1:07:34.251
Hello?

1:07:55.755 --> 1:07:56.894
The hell?

1:08:18.157 --> 1:08:19.192
What?

1:08:55.194 --> 1:08:56.540
Hello?

1:09:02.684 --> 1:09:03.719
Heather?

1:09:05.859 --> 1:09:06.929
Oh, my God.

1:09:11.520 --> 1:09:12.556
Oh, my God.

1:09:12.694 --> 1:09:13.729
Oh, my God! Heather!

1:09:26.535 --> 1:09:28.468
Based on the autopsy,
whoever did this

1:09:28.606 --> 1:09:30.850
was there minutes
before you arrived.

1:09:33.197 --> 1:09:34.785
You're lucky to be alive.

1:09:38.237 --> 1:09:41.274
They must've seen
the messages I sent to her.

1:09:42.620 --> 1:09:44.208
They knew I was coming.

1:09:48.626 --> 1:09:52.803
I just don't understand
why she'd be messaging him.

1:09:52.941 --> 1:09:56.289
Look, the wiped computer,
the missing files...

1:09:56.427 --> 1:09:58.118
My guess is
that she knew something

1:09:58.257 --> 1:09:59.810
that Kevin
didn't want us to know.

1:10:01.398 --> 1:10:03.434
She wasn't willfully
messaging him.

1:10:04.987 --> 1:10:06.713
He was threatening her.

1:10:06.851 --> 1:10:08.543
And the photos were...?

1:10:08.681 --> 1:10:10.683
To keep her quiet. Yeah.

1:10:15.826 --> 1:10:18.173
She was trying to protect me.

1:10:21.072 --> 1:10:24.800
But if Kevin is still
in Colombia, who did this?

1:10:24.938 --> 1:10:26.319
I don't know.

1:10:26.457 --> 1:10:28.977
But in the meantime,
LAPD will stay there with you

1:10:29.115 --> 1:10:31.738
until they find a safe place
for you to go. Okay?

1:10:33.671 --> 1:10:36.467
Look, Mr. Lin is the key
to all of this.

1:10:36.605 --> 1:10:38.711
Now, the good news is
police may have spotted him

1:10:38.849 --> 1:10:42.335
near the border,
so it might not be long.

1:10:42.473 --> 1:10:45.027
He is our best chance
at finding your mom.

1:10:47.789 --> 1:10:48.824
Yeah.

1:10:50.895 --> 1:10:52.138
Thank you.

1:13:11.415 --> 1:13:12.485
!¡Policía!

1:13:14.349 --> 1:13:17.145
Okay! Hey! Hold up!

1:13:17.283 --> 1:13:18.284
Tranquilo.

1:13:19.837 --> 1:13:21.011
No comprendo.

1:13:23.600 --> 1:13:24.635
Please!

1:16:02.931 --> 1:16:04.726
Hey, sweetheart. It's Mom.

1:16:04.864 --> 1:16:08.454
Just, um, wondering if you
wanted to catch a movie toni--

1:16:13.286 --> 1:16:17.325
Hi, my name is Grace Allen,
and I'm actually your mother,

1:16:17.463 --> 1:16:20.052
if you could call me back
at your earliest convenience.

1:16:20.190 --> 1:16:22.399
Hey, Siri. Call Junie--

1:16:22.537 --> 1:16:24.884
Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.
I thought this was a--

1:16:25.022 --> 1:16:26.886
Never mind.

1:16:27.024 --> 1:16:28.301
Hey, Junebug.

1:16:28.439 --> 1:16:30.027
It's Mommy.

1:16:30.165 --> 1:16:33.652
I tried knocking, uh,
but you didn't answer.

1:16:33.790 --> 1:16:36.033
I'm sure you have
your headphones on.

1:16:36.171 --> 1:16:38.829
Ah...

1:16:38.967 --> 1:16:43.696
Look, there's actually a lot
I want to talk with you about.

1:16:43.834 --> 1:16:47.838
So anyway, you're probably not
even checking these messages,

1:16:47.976 --> 1:16:50.220
but I guess we'll talk later.

1:16:50.358 --> 1:16:52.118
I love you.

1:16:52.256 --> 1:16:53.154
Bye--

1:17:06.339 --> 1:17:08.548
Hey, Junebug. It's--

1:19:27.480 --> 1:19:28.378
Hello?

1:20:30.060 --> 1:20:31.303
- Hello?
- June?

1:20:31.441 --> 1:20:33.236
Thank God. Are you safe?

1:20:33.374 --> 1:20:35.272
Yeah. Yeah, I think so. Why?

1:20:35.410 --> 1:20:37.240
Are all the doors locked?

1:20:37.378 --> 1:20:38.724
Yeah, I think so.

1:20:38.862 --> 1:20:41.554
Wait, this is Jimmy
from the church thing?

1:20:41.692 --> 1:20:43.073
Look, there's a lot to explain,

1:20:43.211 --> 1:20:45.420
but we don't know
who's listening.

1:20:45.558 --> 1:20:48.423
Okay. Well,
should I call someone?

1:20:48.561 --> 1:20:51.047
No, no, no, I don't know
who to trust at this point.

1:20:51.185 --> 1:20:53.946
Look, just stay on the phone
with me, okay?

1:20:55.810 --> 1:20:59.124
Oh, my God. Someone's here.

1:20:59.262 --> 1:21:00.401
It's just me.

1:21:00.539 --> 1:21:02.161
Don't worry.
It's gonna be okay.

1:21:02.299 --> 1:21:03.438
What?

1:21:03.576 --> 1:21:05.682
What are you doing here?

1:21:05.820 --> 1:21:08.512
I came as soon as I could.
I didn't mean to scare you.

1:21:08.650 --> 1:21:10.135
No, you need to tell me
what's going on right now

1:21:10.273 --> 1:21:12.137
before I call the police!

1:21:29.637 --> 1:21:30.534
Listen.

1:21:32.605 --> 1:21:34.124
I know this sounds crazy.

1:21:35.919 --> 1:21:37.679
I came as soon as I could.

1:21:39.474 --> 1:21:41.338
I'm sorry to show up
like this...

1:21:43.030 --> 1:21:44.514
but there are things...

1:21:45.964 --> 1:21:47.827
There are things
that you need to know.

1:21:52.832 --> 1:21:54.662
I can explain everything.

1:22:02.325 --> 1:22:03.188
June?

1:22:04.499 --> 1:22:05.569
Are you still there?

1:22:10.643 --> 1:22:11.575
June.

1:22:15.372 --> 1:22:16.373
June?

1:22:18.375 --> 1:22:19.790
If you can hear me...

1:22:21.344 --> 1:22:22.966
Look, I know this is hard.

1:22:24.726 --> 1:22:28.454
But you deserve
to know what happened.

1:22:32.044 --> 1:22:32.976
Please.

1:22:36.876 --> 1:22:38.361
June?

1:22:49.061 --> 1:22:50.028
Dad.

1:22:56.344 --> 1:22:57.414
June.

1:22:57.552 --> 1:22:58.829
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

1:22:58.967 --> 1:22:59.899
Okay, okay.

1:23:00.038 --> 1:23:01.591
Wait.

1:23:01.729 --> 1:23:03.351
Okay.

1:23:03.489 --> 1:23:04.870
What is going on?

1:23:10.876 --> 1:23:12.015
Your mom...

1:23:13.879 --> 1:23:15.536
Her real name is Sarah.

1:23:16.985 --> 1:23:19.091
And when you were little,

1:23:19.229 --> 1:23:20.817
we were always fighting.

1:23:22.474 --> 1:23:25.994
She barely would let me
feed you...

1:23:26.133 --> 1:23:27.962
or play with you.

1:23:29.998 --> 1:23:33.450
Every day
it got worse and worse.

1:23:34.934 --> 1:23:36.660
Until she took you away.

1:23:38.628 --> 1:23:41.976
And I've been searching for you
ever since.

1:23:45.704 --> 1:23:46.739
Hey.

1:23:46.877 --> 1:23:48.224
Caesar.

1:23:53.505 --> 1:23:55.921
She told me you were dead.

1:23:58.682 --> 1:24:00.926
June, you don't know
what she's capable of.

1:24:02.928 --> 1:24:06.690
She lied to a judge
to have me put in prison

1:24:06.828 --> 1:24:09.176
so that she could have you
to herself.

1:24:10.591 --> 1:24:12.144
She lied to me.

1:24:14.940 --> 1:24:17.356
Every day for 12 years...

1:24:18.702 --> 1:24:20.325
I had to wake up in Eastham

1:24:20.463 --> 1:24:22.913
knowing that she had you somewhere.

1:24:31.301 --> 1:24:33.338
You were in Eastham Prison?

1:24:35.650 --> 1:24:36.962
In Texas?

1:24:37.100 --> 1:24:37.997
June.

1:24:39.102 --> 1:24:41.139
She took everything from me.

1:24:43.658 --> 1:24:45.453
But that's where Kevin was.

1:24:48.594 --> 1:24:50.493
You weren't his counselor.

1:24:52.426 --> 1:24:54.152
You met him in prison.

1:24:57.948 --> 1:24:59.018
Sweetheart.

1:25:00.572 --> 1:25:02.056
Please.

1:25:12.618 --> 1:25:14.068
June.

1:25:14.206 --> 1:25:15.863
Can we just talk for a minute?

1:25:17.347 --> 1:25:19.246
Where is she?

1:25:19.384 --> 1:25:20.661
Sweetheart.

1:25:22.973 --> 1:25:24.389
- Hey, no! June!
- Help!

1:25:24.527 --> 1:25:25.424
No, no, no!

1:25:33.984 --> 1:25:35.054
It's okay.

1:25:59.700 --> 1:26:02.254
Well, then I'm just gonna
fix it again, aren't I?

1:26:02.392 --> 1:26:04.429
What's that?

1:26:04.567 --> 1:26:06.810
- James.
- It's just the altitude.

1:26:06.948 --> 1:26:08.329
- I'm fine.
- James, are you okay?

1:26:08.467 --> 1:26:10.228
No, no, no, no. Daddy's fine.

1:26:12.713 --> 1:26:14.577
James.

1:26:14.715 --> 1:26:15.716
Are you good?

1:26:18.132 --> 1:26:19.961
Hey, do you wanna play
hide-and-seek?
Mm-hm.

1:26:20.099 --> 1:26:22.585
Okay. You wanna go upstairs?
I'll count to 20.

1:26:22.723 --> 1:26:25.243
And don't let Daddy find you.
Okay?

1:26:33.112 --> 1:26:34.735
Why you gotta do that
in front of her?

1:26:34.873 --> 1:26:37.393
Do what?

1:26:37.531 --> 1:26:38.877
"Are you good?"

1:26:40.327 --> 1:26:42.501
What, I can't play
with my own daughter now?

1:26:42.639 --> 1:26:45.159
- I didn't say anything.
- Seriously?

1:26:45.297 --> 1:26:47.679
It's just that I saw you
go out back and I know--

1:26:47.817 --> 1:26:49.957
Are you filming this?

1:26:50.095 --> 1:26:52.753
- No, I'm not filming anything.
- Give me the camera.

1:27:00.623 --> 1:27:04.420
Sarah, I've been trying
to call. Where are you?

1:27:04.558 --> 1:27:06.111
Are you at the house?

1:27:06.249 --> 1:27:07.146
Yeah.

1:27:09.252 --> 1:27:11.944
Look, how about
you and June come back,

1:27:12.082 --> 1:27:14.188
and we talk this out. Okay?

1:27:14.326 --> 1:27:16.294
I just put that
all over my black eye...

1:27:16.432 --> 1:27:19.055
You promised me
you would stay clean.

1:27:19.193 --> 1:27:21.264
And what,
you're saying I haven't?

1:27:21.402 --> 1:27:24.854
You can't just make shit up

1:27:24.992 --> 1:27:27.546
in order to steal my daughter
from me, Sarah.

1:27:32.965 --> 1:27:35.416
Look, Sare-bear, I'm sorry.

1:27:35.554 --> 1:27:37.142
I didn't mean to get upset.

1:27:38.281 --> 1:27:39.834
It's just--

1:27:39.972 --> 1:27:42.665
It is frustrating
trying to reason with you

1:27:42.803 --> 1:27:45.461
when you won't acknowledge
baseline facts.

1:27:52.364 --> 1:27:54.504
Look, I promise I'm clean.

1:27:54.642 --> 1:27:56.748
Can you just come home,

1:27:56.886 --> 1:27:59.198
so that we can work this out
as a family?

1:28:00.372 --> 1:28:01.477
For June's sake?

1:28:08.276 --> 1:28:11.349
Then how do you explain what
I found in the hallway closet?

1:28:11.487 --> 1:28:12.350
What?

1:28:13.868 --> 1:28:15.111
What are you talking about?

1:28:16.699 --> 1:28:18.563
We were playing hide-and-seek.

1:28:19.736 --> 1:28:21.566
And guess what June found.

1:28:21.704 --> 1:28:23.740
Okay, Sarah.
Yes, I found a way

1:28:23.878 --> 1:28:26.225
to turn some stuff over,
but it's worth a lot,

1:28:26.364 --> 1:28:28.918
so you need to cut the shit

1:28:29.056 --> 1:28:31.438
and tell me
what you did with it!

1:28:31.576 --> 1:28:33.232
I left it where it was.

1:28:33.371 --> 1:28:35.269
Police! Open the door!

1:28:35.407 --> 1:28:37.444
Jesus Christ, what did you do?

1:28:37.582 --> 1:28:40.516
I can't let you put our
daughter in danger anymore.

1:28:40.654 --> 1:28:42.069
You need to open the door!

1:28:42.207 --> 1:28:44.416
I swear to God,
I will find you

1:28:44.554 --> 1:28:47.212
and you will die
in a pool of your own blood

1:28:47.350 --> 1:28:48.869
before you take her from me!

1:28:49.007 --> 1:28:49.904
Do you hear me?!

1:29:41.300 --> 1:29:43.371
I can't imagine what you
must be going through.

1:29:43.510 --> 1:29:45.373
We really hate to see you go.

1:29:45.512 --> 1:29:47.237
I really had no idea
what you were going through.

1:29:47.375 --> 1:29:49.343
I love you.
I'm praying for you and June.

1:29:49.481 --> 1:29:51.690
I know you two are gonna get
through this together.

1:29:51.828 --> 1:29:53.830
Just--
We're gonna miss you a lot.

1:29:53.968 --> 1:29:55.487
Someday she'll understand.

1:29:55.625 --> 1:29:56.523
No!

1:31:08.146 --> 1:31:10.182
No! No!

1:31:17.155 --> 1:31:19.364
Just gotta take care of one
thing, and then we'll leave.

1:32:00.232 --> 1:32:01.164
Shit.

1:32:13.970 --> 1:32:14.902
We're going outside.

1:32:16.663 --> 1:32:19.010
If you were gonna kill me,
you woulda done it already.

1:32:20.977 --> 1:32:22.461
Things have changed.

1:32:30.987 --> 1:32:32.610
June.

1:32:32.748 --> 1:32:33.818
June!

1:32:35.854 --> 1:32:37.407
Twelve years, Sarah.

1:32:37.545 --> 1:32:41.308
Twelve years, I felt just like
you feel right now.

1:32:41.446 --> 1:32:44.276
I wish I could've kept you
here. But...

1:32:45.933 --> 1:32:47.417
June and I have to go.

1:32:49.903 --> 1:32:50.800
June!

1:33:16.826 --> 1:33:18.552
Oh, my God. Junie!

1:33:18.690 --> 1:33:21.348
- Mom! Mom? Mom?
- Okay, baby. You're okay.

1:33:21.486 --> 1:33:23.626
- Is that really you?
- Baby, I am so sorry.

1:33:24.662 --> 1:33:26.664
I am so sorry.

1:33:34.672 --> 1:33:36.190
We have to get out of here,
do you understand me?

1:33:36.328 --> 1:33:37.571
He is spiraling.

1:33:37.709 --> 1:33:39.677
- He killed Heather.
- He killed Heather?

1:33:39.815 --> 1:33:42.058
He's crazy.
He thinks he's punishing me

1:33:42.196 --> 1:33:43.370
for what I did to him.

1:33:44.889 --> 1:33:47.029
Okay. I'm gonna
tell you everything in the car.

1:33:47.167 --> 1:33:48.547
I want you to take the keys--

1:33:48.686 --> 1:33:50.239
No, Mom!

1:33:50.377 --> 1:33:52.413
No! No! No, no, no!

1:33:52.551 --> 1:33:53.725
Oh, my God!

1:33:53.863 --> 1:33:55.037
Oh, God.

1:34:03.045 --> 1:34:04.184
Where is he going?

1:34:04.322 --> 1:34:05.564
The chair.

1:34:07.601 --> 1:34:08.878
Okay.

1:34:16.127 --> 1:34:18.681
- What is he gonna do to us?
- I don't know.

1:34:18.819 --> 1:34:20.890
I don't even know
why he brought you here.

1:34:24.860 --> 1:34:26.620
Oh, 'cause he knew.

1:34:26.758 --> 1:34:28.656
He knew I was
about to find him.

1:34:28.795 --> 1:34:30.555
Okay.

1:34:34.248 --> 1:34:35.249
Wait.

1:34:44.293 --> 1:34:46.571
Hello? Hello, hello?
Can anyone hear me?

1:34:46.709 --> 1:34:48.780
Okay, June,
we have to get out of here

1:34:48.918 --> 1:34:51.058
while he's still outside.
Where's your phone?

1:34:51.196 --> 1:34:52.542
I don't have my phone.
It's at the house.

1:34:52.680 --> 1:34:54.648
If only I could just...

1:34:58.238 --> 1:34:59.101
Oh, my God.

1:35:00.585 --> 1:35:01.482
What?

1:35:02.587 --> 1:35:04.347
Oh, my God, yes!

1:35:04.485 --> 1:35:06.902
Do you remember
the address to this place?

1:35:07.040 --> 1:35:09.352
I think it was something
Mariposa Road?

1:35:09.490 --> 1:35:11.078
But that's all I remember.

1:35:11.216 --> 1:35:13.115
Everything needs
to be paired with a phone.

1:35:13.253 --> 1:35:14.841
- Oh, gosh.
- Wait.

1:35:14.979 --> 1:35:16.635
- What?
- Unless...

1:35:21.606 --> 1:35:23.815
Okay. I have an idea.

1:35:43.421 --> 1:35:44.940
I need to use the navigation.

1:35:45.078 --> 1:35:47.045
Please do not call again.
Okay? Bye.

1:35:47.183 --> 1:35:49.668
Javi, please! I'm sorry
about what I said.

1:35:49.807 --> 1:35:51.739
You did not give up
on your son.

1:35:53.327 --> 1:35:56.227
I found my mom,
but we're running out of time.

1:35:56.365 --> 1:35:58.919
Please, I need your help.

1:35:59.057 --> 1:36:00.300
Please.

1:36:03.544 --> 1:36:05.029
What?

1:36:05.167 --> 1:36:07.376
I need you to go to my Instagram
and find a picture.

1:36:07.514 --> 1:36:10.172
- I still don't see him.
- Javi, please hurry.

1:36:10.310 --> 1:36:12.519
Sí, sí, momentico.

1:36:12.657 --> 1:36:13.865
What's the account name?

1:36:14.003 --> 1:36:16.281
It's J-U-underscore-U--

1:36:16.419 --> 1:36:18.559
"Underscore"?
- ¿Qué es eso?
- What's that?

1:36:18.697 --> 1:36:21.908
It's the little line,
like at the bottom, you know?

1:36:22.046 --> 1:36:22.943
Yeah.

1:36:23.081 --> 1:36:26.705
So it's J-U-underscore-U-N-E-1.

1:36:30.502 --> 1:36:33.920
Okay, I need you to go to the
first picture on my Instagram.

1:36:35.507 --> 1:36:36.888
Great. On the house behind us,

1:36:37.026 --> 1:36:38.614
there are numbers.
What are they?

1:36:38.752 --> 1:36:42.756
Um, 48541.

1:36:42.894 --> 1:36:45.517
Okay, call the police
and tell them we are at 4--

1:36:49.004 --> 1:36:50.143
Oh, no.

1:36:50.281 --> 1:36:51.592
He's coming back.

1:36:54.147 --> 1:36:55.182
Get back.

1:36:59.221 --> 1:37:00.360
What's going on?

1:37:02.086 --> 1:37:03.259
Give me the watch.

1:37:03.397 --> 1:37:04.674
Hey!

1:37:04.812 --> 1:37:08.023
I am talking to my daughter.

1:37:08.161 --> 1:37:10.922
June, did you just make a call?

1:37:12.786 --> 1:37:15.375
Okay. Now, I need you
to come with me right now.

1:37:15.513 --> 1:37:17.756
- James.
- Back off.

1:37:18.930 --> 1:37:20.725
June, come with me, please.

1:37:20.863 --> 1:37:22.106
Leave her alone.

1:37:22.244 --> 1:37:25.385
One more word from you,
and you are dead.

1:37:27.042 --> 1:37:29.699
June, I'm not gonna ask again.

1:37:29.837 --> 1:37:30.700
Please don't--

1:37:34.394 --> 1:37:35.567
Mom!

1:37:37.259 --> 1:37:39.640
No, no, no!

1:37:39.778 --> 1:37:41.988
Mom!

1:37:42.126 --> 1:37:44.473
What did you do?! No!

1:37:44.611 --> 1:37:46.371
- What did you do?
- Hey.

1:37:47.441 --> 1:37:48.960
June--

1:37:49.098 --> 1:37:50.444
Come on. Hey!

1:37:54.069 --> 1:37:55.622
Get off of me!

1:37:55.760 --> 1:37:58.970
See? It's okay.

1:37:59.108 --> 1:38:00.868
You're just making this harder.

1:38:19.957 --> 1:38:21.027
Please.

1:38:22.960 --> 1:38:24.685
No, no, no!

1:38:24.823 --> 1:38:27.826
Hey! Hey, let us out!
Let us out!

1:38:29.414 --> 1:38:30.864
Mom!

1:38:31.002 --> 1:38:32.521
Mom. Mom.

1:38:32.659 --> 1:38:33.901
No.

1:38:40.184 --> 1:38:43.359
Dad. Dad, please.
Please don't do this.

1:38:43.497 --> 1:38:46.811
Please, if you can hear me,
just open the door, please!

1:38:46.949 --> 1:38:49.227
She needs help! Please!

1:38:49.365 --> 1:38:52.196
No one has to die.
Just please call for help!

1:38:52.334 --> 1:38:53.576
Anyone!

1:38:53.714 --> 1:38:54.888
If anyone can hear me,

1:38:55.026 --> 1:38:56.786
I am trapped in a room
with my mom!

1:38:56.924 --> 1:39:00.100
We are at 48541 Mariposa Road.

1:39:10.593 --> 1:39:12.043
Anyone.

1:39:14.632 --> 1:39:15.702
Junebug?

1:39:16.841 --> 1:39:17.980
Mom.

1:39:20.189 --> 1:39:23.020
No. Mom, it's okay.

1:39:23.158 --> 1:39:24.573
Oh, my God.

1:39:24.711 --> 1:39:25.850
I'm so sorry.

1:39:25.988 --> 1:39:27.541
No, no, no.

1:39:27.679 --> 1:39:30.717
No, you don't say that.
No. No, you don't say that.

1:39:35.342 --> 1:39:36.826
I'm sorry.

1:39:48.183 --> 1:39:50.150
I promise...

1:39:50.288 --> 1:39:54.016
I promise if we could
just get home, I'll be better.

1:39:56.087 --> 1:39:58.469
I'll start checking
my voicemails.

1:40:00.229 --> 1:40:03.405
I'll let you call me Junebug
all you want.

1:40:05.959 --> 1:40:07.926
And I'll stop making fun of you

1:40:08.065 --> 1:40:11.102
for using Siri
for literally everything.

1:40:12.414 --> 1:40:13.553
I just...

1:40:38.888 --> 1:40:40.097
Hey, Siri.

1:40:47.242 --> 1:40:48.760
Call 911.

1:40:52.833 --> 1:40:56.147
Distress call at 48541
Mariposa Road.

1:40:56.285 --> 1:40:59.357
Any available units in the
vicinity, report immediately.

1:41:03.568 --> 1:41:04.914
Go, go, go!

1:41:09.919 --> 1:41:12.025
- Go, go, go!
- Clear!

1:41:12.163 --> 1:41:13.268
- Go, go, go!
- Clear.

1:41:13.406 --> 1:41:14.579
Check the other side!

1:41:14.717 --> 1:41:16.305
Hallway clear.

1:41:16.443 --> 1:41:18.342
Suspect down!

1:41:18.480 --> 1:41:19.998
Help!

1:41:20.137 --> 1:41:21.793
We need help!

1:41:23.278 --> 1:41:25.314
- SWAT! Let me see your hands!
- Hands up!

1:41:25.452 --> 1:41:26.798
Victim down, victim down!

1:41:26.936 --> 1:41:28.179
Clear!

1:41:28.317 --> 1:41:30.630
Lung's collapsed.
We need a transport now.

1:41:30.768 --> 1:41:32.045
Is she okay?

1:41:32.183 --> 1:41:34.116
30-Squad to Control,
we have an adult female,

1:41:34.254 --> 1:41:37.154
upper body GSW,
requesting airlift.

1:42:23.234 --> 1:42:25.581
Hey, Junebug, it's Mom.
I hope I'm not interrupting--

1:42:25.719 --> 1:42:27.273
- Mom?
- Yeah?

1:42:27.411 --> 1:42:29.620
This is FaceTime.

1:42:29.758 --> 1:42:31.415
Oh, gosh.

1:42:31.553 --> 1:42:34.072
I know, I know. I just put
the phone down for a second.

1:42:34.211 --> 1:42:35.798
- Mm-hm.
- I just wanted to remind you

1:42:35.936 --> 1:42:37.800
that your bus leaves at 8:35
in the morning,

1:42:37.938 --> 1:42:39.802
so you might wanna set
multiple alarms.

1:42:39.940 --> 1:42:41.218
Yep. Already did.

1:42:41.356 --> 1:42:42.805
I'll also send you
some lunch money

1:42:42.943 --> 1:42:44.635
if you need any, okay?

1:42:44.773 --> 1:42:46.464
What?

1:42:46.602 --> 1:42:47.603
Nothing.

1:42:49.053 --> 1:42:50.227
Just thank you.

1:42:54.231 --> 1:42:55.956
Oh, guess what.

1:42:56.094 --> 1:42:58.649
Your friend Javi
friended me on Facebook.

1:42:58.787 --> 1:43:00.961
For real? No way.

1:43:07.416 --> 1:43:10.212
Okay. Well, I guess I'll see you
at Union Station

1:43:10.350 --> 1:43:11.386
tomorrow afternoon.

1:43:11.524 --> 1:43:12.973
Can't wait.

1:43:13.111 --> 1:43:14.147
Bye.

1:43:15.355 --> 1:43:16.253
Oh, hey--
