02:14.770 --> 02:16.415
You know what l'd really like?

02:16.589 --> 02:18.728
Let me guess.

02:18.903 --> 02:23.193
What l really wish is that
l didn't have to go home so early.

02:23.367 --> 02:25.341
So why don't you forget
your curfew?

02:25.517 --> 02:29.807
Oh, yeah, right, ''Mom, Dad,
l'll be home whenever l feel like it.''

02:29.981 --> 02:32.578
- l don't think so.
- What about Baja?

02:32.750 --> 02:34.560
What about Baja?

02:34.776 --> 02:36.715
l'm going this weekend.
You wanna come with?

02:37.959 --> 02:40.016
They'd never let me go
in a million years.

02:40.191 --> 02:41.212
Which l don't understand

02:41.389 --> 02:43.446
because they let you
come over here all the time.

02:43.621 --> 02:45.019
l mean, what's the difference?

02:45.233 --> 02:48.124
The difference is that l come home
at night.

02:48.292 --> 02:51.054
And when l'm tucked in my bed,
l am still their little girl.

02:51.268 --> 02:53.407
So tell them you'll be gone
for 36 hours.

02:53.624 --> 02:55.480
Leave Saturday morning,
come back Sunday night.

02:55.650 --> 02:57.095
- Dylan--
- lt doesn't hurt to ask.

02:57.262 --> 02:59.530
You never know,
they might surprise you, say yes.

02:59.949 --> 03:01.724
Maybe they will.

03:05.942 --> 03:07.387
l've really got to get home.

03:07.595 --> 03:09.816
Forget your curfew.

03:10.365 --> 03:12.140
You're right.

03:12.308 --> 03:14.282
And as long as l'm close,
they don't care.

03:14.457 --> 03:16.149
Good.

03:16.317 --> 03:19.244
Besides, l tiptoe.

03:32.686 --> 03:34.461
Brenda?

03:35.496 --> 03:36.600
Hi, Dad. Good night, Dad.

03:36.778 --> 03:40.034
Wait, wait, wait just a minute.

03:40.209 --> 03:41.869
Do you have any idea
what time it is?

03:42.086 --> 03:44.079
Yeah, l'm sorry.
l lost track of time.

03:44.297 --> 03:46.254
Well, that's what you said
the last time.

03:46.424 --> 03:49.045
What's the point of a curfew
if you're never gonna follow it?

03:49.220 --> 03:51.545
Well, l was beginning
to wonder that myself.

03:52.265 --> 03:56.133
You know, we haven't talked
about this in quite some time.

03:56.312 --> 03:58.933
And frankly, l thought things
were under control.

03:59.107 --> 04:00.269
But it's getting to the point

04:00.442 --> 04:02.767
when you're spending altogether
too much time with Dylan.

04:02.945 --> 04:04.487
Can we talk about this
in the morning?

04:04.655 --> 04:06.944
No, we'll talk about this right now.

04:08.118 --> 04:10.490
Brenda, you're in high school.

04:10.663 --> 04:13.332
On school nights, l expect you
to be home at a reasonable hour,

04:13.499 --> 04:15.705
getting your studies done,
getting a good night's rest.

04:15.919 --> 04:18.077
Dad, you're treating me like a kid.
l'm 1 7 years old.

04:18.255 --> 04:20.129
My grades are fine.
What's the big deal?

04:20.341 --> 04:21.372
The big deal is

04:21.551 --> 04:25.134
when are you gonna start paying
attention to the curfew around here?

04:25.848 --> 04:27.971
You know, l don't ask
that much of you, do l?

04:29.018 --> 04:30.429
No.

04:31.563 --> 04:33.105
So this won't be a problem, right?

04:33.858 --> 04:35.934
l always do the right thing, don't l?

04:37.571 --> 04:38.650
Yes, you do.

04:39.782 --> 04:41.573
Good night.

04:46.915 --> 04:48.908
Look, our bridesmaids' dresses
are in this mag.

04:49.085 --> 04:51.291
That's nice. Very quaint.

04:51.463 --> 04:54.334
Kelly, your mom's getting married
and you act like you don't even care.

04:54.508 --> 04:56.085
That's very observant of you,
Donna.

04:56.260 --> 04:58.134
Hey, are you guys ready for this?

04:58.304 --> 05:01.756
l got your mom and my dad
the hottest wedding present ever.

05:01.934 --> 05:04.805
Diamond earrings? l don't get it.

05:04.979 --> 05:08.064
Well, it's one for each of them.
lt's sort of a love-bond thing.

05:08.233 --> 05:10.605
But, David, your dad doesn't even
have his ear pierced.

05:10.778 --> 05:14.397
He doesn't now, but he will.
That's the idea.

05:14.574 --> 05:15.605
So, what do you think?

05:15.784 --> 05:20.162
l think if l hear one more thing
about this wedding, l'm gonna scream.

05:20.999 --> 05:22.956
Wow, what's her problem?

05:23.127 --> 05:24.954
Maybe she's jealous.

05:30.094 --> 05:32.419
- So?
- So?

05:32.597 --> 05:35.384
- What did your father say?
- l just have to find the right time.

05:35.559 --> 05:37.848
l'm leaving Saturday.
Maybe we should ask him together?

05:38.020 --> 05:40.096
Oh, Dylan, l don't know.

05:40.273 --> 05:42.515
- Brenda.
- Hello.

05:42.692 --> 05:43.890
So about this weekend,

05:44.111 --> 05:46.187
l was thinking we could rent
9 million videos and--

05:46.363 --> 05:48.356
Listen, Kelly,
maybe we can do it another time.

05:48.575 --> 05:50.983
l can't make it through
another weekend listening

05:51.161 --> 05:54.246
to the bride and groom deciding
whether to serve chicken or fish.

05:54.457 --> 05:57.292
l know, it's just that Dylan
invited me to go to Baja with him.

05:58.253 --> 05:59.877
And Cindy and Jim
are letting you go?

06:00.923 --> 06:04.423
She hasn't asked them yet.

06:04.928 --> 06:07.501
Well, in that case,
what videos should we rent?

06:07.723 --> 06:09.716
Kelly, they might say yes.
You never know.

06:09.934 --> 06:11.974
- Yeah, right.
- Anyway if they do, is it okay?

06:12.145 --> 06:14.814
- l mean, do you mind?
- Yeah, l mind.

06:15.024 --> 06:17.396
l don't see why you'd wanna go
and spend an incredibly cool

06:17.568 --> 06:19.525
and romantic weekend
with your boyfriend,

06:19.696 --> 06:22.068
when you could stay here in town
and be miserable with me.

06:22.283 --> 06:24.074
Thanks, Kel.
l knew you'd understand.

06:32.670 --> 06:35.541
- When are we gonna ask?
- Just wait.

06:35.716 --> 06:38.551
Hey, what's going on?
What's all the secrecy?

06:38.719 --> 06:40.178
Nothing.

06:40.346 --> 06:42.339
Brenda, l was talking to Jackie
on the phone today

06:42.516 --> 06:45.007
and she said Kelly's
taking this thing very hard.

06:45.227 --> 06:46.507
Well, Mom, you know Kelly.

06:46.688 --> 06:49.440
l mean, she has a flair for melodrama
but she'll be fine.

06:49.650 --> 06:51.808
Just the same, maybe while
you're there this weekend,

06:51.986 --> 06:55.153
you could do something to,
you know, snap her out of it.

06:55.365 --> 06:58.615
l don't think l'm gonna be spending
the weekend at Kelly's after all.

06:58.828 --> 06:59.907
Oh, really? Why?

07:00.079 --> 07:01.573
Dylan and l made other plans.

07:02.916 --> 07:04.540
After you made a commitment
to Kelly?

07:04.751 --> 07:07.324
lt wasn't a commitment.
We were just gonna hang out together.

07:07.547 --> 07:09.255
Well, what are you two
planning instead?

07:09.424 --> 07:10.455
Yes, do tell.

07:10.675 --> 07:14.009
Actually, l'm going surfing
for the weekend in Baja.

07:14.180 --> 07:16.801
And Dylan invited me to go.
l mean, isn't that great?

07:19.061 --> 07:21.896
- Baja?
- As in Mexico?

07:22.106 --> 07:23.220
Brandon, stay out of it.

07:23.399 --> 07:25.605
lt's just for a couple of days, sir.

07:25.777 --> 07:27.437
Actually it's only for a day and a half.

07:27.613 --> 07:30.448
l mean we're leaving Saturday morning
and we'll be back Sunday night.

07:31.367 --> 07:33.276
Brenda, are you asking me

07:33.453 --> 07:35.611
if you can go to Mexico
with Dylan for the weekend?

07:35.790 --> 07:37.284
Because if you are, the answer is--

07:37.500 --> 07:39.540
Dad, come on. l mean,
you let me go to Yosemite.

07:39.753 --> 07:42.671
This is different. You were with
your brother and the rest of the gang.

07:42.840 --> 07:45.925
You're talking about running off to
a foreign country with your boyfriend.

07:46.136 --> 07:48.805
- Dad, please.
- Let me and Dad talk about it.

07:52.852 --> 07:54.975
You're not actually
considering this, are you?

07:55.147 --> 07:58.101
Yes. l mean, what are you
so worried about?

07:58.276 --> 08:00.150
Everything.

08:00.320 --> 08:02.893
Jim, they are 1 7 years old.

08:03.073 --> 08:05.564
That's what l'm worried about.

08:05.743 --> 08:07.700
Where they gonna stay?

08:07.871 --> 08:09.151
A motel, probably.

08:09.331 --> 08:11.122
Oh, wonderful.

08:11.292 --> 08:13.961
Jim, would you listen to yourself?
You sound just like my father.

08:14.170 --> 08:15.830
l always liked your father.

08:18.842 --> 08:21.084
So where exactly
are you staying, Dylan?

08:21.262 --> 08:22.839
Well, l always stay
at the same place.

08:23.014 --> 08:24.841
lt's called La Boca Grande.

08:25.017 --> 08:29.062
lt's really clean.
lt's really a family sort of guesthouse.

08:29.230 --> 08:30.772
You mean a motel?

08:30.941 --> 08:32.020
Something like that.

08:33.110 --> 08:35.352
- Something like that?
- You know, Dad.

08:35.571 --> 08:38.144
There's absolutely nothing
to worry about, sir.

08:38.325 --> 08:40.650
- l'll take good care of her.
- l'm sure you will.

08:40.870 --> 08:43.278
- Jim...
- Mom, please.

08:44.749 --> 08:46.077
lt's only two days.

08:46.293 --> 08:48.286
Actually, it's only a day and a half.

08:52.008 --> 08:54.380
l wanna call Dr. Pollack,
make sure you don't need shots.

08:54.595 --> 08:57.086
Dad, there are no shots.

08:57.515 --> 08:59.472
- Are there?
- Oh, no, of course not.

08:59.643 --> 09:02.728
Baja is just like California,
only it's a little farther south.

09:02.938 --> 09:05.014
You have to promise
you'll be careful what you eat.

09:05.233 --> 09:06.513
- Absolutely.
- Definitely.

09:06.693 --> 09:09.398
Wait a minute. You guys
are actually gonna let her go?

09:09.613 --> 09:11.855
- Brandon.
- Just remember one thing:

09:12.033 --> 09:15.319
lf we treat you like an adult,
we expect you to behave like an adult.

09:15.537 --> 09:16.996
l will, l promise.

09:17.748 --> 09:19.159
Thank you, sir.

09:21.545 --> 09:24.297
l love you, Dad. Thanks, Mom.

09:24.506 --> 09:27.543
Now all l have to do
is teach her how to surf.

09:33.559 --> 09:34.590
Would you look at that?

09:34.769 --> 09:37.307
The beach is closed again
because of bacteria in the bay.

09:37.481 --> 09:39.355
This is really gross.

09:39.525 --> 09:41.850
Looks like your first lesson
is gonna have to wait, Bren.

09:42.028 --> 09:43.059
Too bad.

09:43.238 --> 09:45.811
Come on,
let's go get some breakfast.

09:50.163 --> 09:51.491
l don't believe it.

09:55.044 --> 09:56.621
Who is he?

09:57.589 --> 10:00.210
The guy that taught me
how to surf.

10:01.051 --> 10:02.462
Jake.

10:03.221 --> 10:05.712
- Jake.
- Dylan.

10:05.891 --> 10:07.468
- Hey, all right.
- How you doing, man?

10:07.643 --> 10:10.846
- l heard you were living up in Seattle.
- Eugene. l've been back a year now.

10:11.022 --> 10:13.394
What, you didn't call me?
l thought you fell off the Earth.

10:13.567 --> 10:15.856
l tried, l tried.
Your number's been disconnected.

10:16.028 --> 10:19.480
Yeah, l moved a few times.

10:19.658 --> 10:21.734
l hear your old man's
been doing a lot of reading.

10:21.952 --> 10:25.784
Yeah. What goes around,
comes around, right?

10:27.501 --> 10:29.826
- So are you a surfer?
- Well, not quite.

10:30.004 --> 10:32.127
Actually, today was gonna be
my first lesson.

10:32.340 --> 10:35.211
- No luck. Funky beach.
- Yeah, l saw the sign.

10:35.385 --> 10:37.591
That last storm must have
really flushed out the city.

10:37.805 --> 10:39.596
We gotta stop using that ocean
for a toilet.

10:40.141 --> 10:42.893
Head down south, Dylan.
No people, no garbage.

10:43.103 --> 10:44.977
Actually, we're going to Baja
this weekend.

10:45.189 --> 10:47.810
Really? Well, that sounds great.

10:47.984 --> 10:51.104
- l'm Jake Hanson.
- Brenda Walsh.

10:51.280 --> 10:53.569
Dylan told me
that you taught him how to surf.

10:53.741 --> 10:55.817
How to surf,
how to ride a motorcycle.

10:55.994 --> 10:57.369
How to pick up girls.

10:57.579 --> 11:00.746
Well, fortunately,
he's unlearned a few of those lessons.

11:00.917 --> 11:02.459
Yeah, l bet he has.

11:03.503 --> 11:04.831
Where are you living these days?

11:05.047 --> 11:08.297
Just a little place off Melrose.
Nothing special.

11:08.468 --> 11:11.255
You ought to stop by the Pit.
l'm there every night for dinner.

11:11.471 --> 11:13.380
- That place still around?
- Are you kidding?

11:13.599 --> 11:15.639
Man, you have been out of touch.

11:20.816 --> 11:23.389
So, young lovebirds,
que quieres comer?

11:23.569 --> 11:25.775
- Come again?
- lt's espanol, Bren.

11:25.947 --> 11:28.699
Don't you think you ought to brush up
before your big adventure?

11:28.868 --> 11:32.866
Quiero un hamburger, por favor.
And hold the attitude, please.

11:33.498 --> 11:35.407
l can't believe they're letting you go.

11:35.584 --> 11:38.918
Yeah, and no thanks to you,
Mr. Benedicto Arnaldo.

11:39.130 --> 11:41.502
- You guys are going to Mexico?
- Yeah, this weekend.

11:41.675 --> 11:44.166
What do you wanna take your
girlfriend with you to Mexico for?

11:44.345 --> 11:46.587
We could do a guy thing.
We could go down, hang out.

11:46.765 --> 11:48.307
Pick up some babes on the beach.

11:48.517 --> 11:51.138
l've always wanted to go to Mexico,
especially Baja.

11:51.312 --> 11:54.931
ln fact, you know what
would really be great?

11:55.108 --> 11:56.851
lf we all went, you know,
like Yosemite.

11:57.027 --> 11:58.901
l mean, the food's not supposed
to cost much,

11:59.071 --> 12:01.147
and if we're careful,
there's no reason to get sick.

12:01.366 --> 12:04.403
l hear hotels are really cheap.
We could caravan. lt would be fun.

12:04.578 --> 12:06.654
lt would be like a real adventure,
don't you think?

12:07.081 --> 12:08.658
No.

12:09.334 --> 12:13.463
Maybe next time. Dylan and l
are trying to keep this trip romantic.

12:14.257 --> 12:16.629
- Sorry.
- lt's okay.

12:16.885 --> 12:18.545
- Just remember one thing, pal.
- Yeah?

12:18.721 --> 12:20.714
My sister snores.

12:21.307 --> 12:22.635
Okay.

12:30.110 --> 12:33.277
Excuse me,
what kind of invitation is this?

12:33.447 --> 12:36.365
Mr. Steve Sanders. No guest?

12:36.534 --> 12:38.574
Dad and Jackie are trying
to keep the numbers down.

12:39.287 --> 12:41.445
Just as well, weddings
are great places to meet girls.

12:41.624 --> 12:45.040
They're always so ripe, so...
So misty-eyed.

12:45.211 --> 12:46.290
And way too old for you.

12:46.505 --> 12:48.332
At the very least,
Kelly will be there, right?

12:48.507 --> 12:50.250
Yeah, if she survives till then.

12:51.261 --> 12:52.292
Why? What's the matter?

12:52.512 --> 12:54.505
She's still not too thrilled
about the whole idea.

12:54.723 --> 12:57.677
l wouldn't be either if l knew
you were moving into my house.

12:57.894 --> 13:00.052
My dad is moving in.
l still haven't made up my mind.

13:00.230 --> 13:01.641
Tell your dad to travel light.

13:01.815 --> 13:04.982
Seems like Kelly's mom likes weddings
more than she does marriages.

13:05.194 --> 13:07.270
Steve, Jackie's changed a lot.

13:07.447 --> 13:08.727
Yeah, l hope so.

13:08.907 --> 13:11.149
l don't know if my dad
could handle another divorce.

13:12.370 --> 13:14.446
l don't know if l could either.

13:19.587 --> 13:22.292
Yo, Nat.
Did you save me a piece of pie?

13:22.841 --> 13:26.293
Jake. Give me a grab.

13:26.470 --> 13:29.388
l heard rumours you were back
in the neighbourhood.

13:29.599 --> 13:32.802
- Listen, l have a bill for you.
- l was afraid of that.

13:32.978 --> 13:35.350
- Glad you could make it.
- Absolutely.

13:35.523 --> 13:36.982
- Hi.
- Hi.

13:37.150 --> 13:38.644
Why don't l introduce you
to the gang?

13:38.819 --> 13:41.310
- All right.
- Okay, Andrea.

13:49.666 --> 13:51.789
So, what kind of work
do you do, Jake?

13:52.002 --> 13:56.997
Wow, let's see...
l ran a big oil company for a while.

13:57.217 --> 13:58.545
And l sold that.

13:58.760 --> 14:02.260
Got into real estate development,
built big hotels on the Kona Coast.

14:02.431 --> 14:04.222
Made a ton of cash.

14:05.101 --> 14:08.435
But l met this incredibly beautiful girl
and blew it all in one big wild weekend.

14:08.606 --> 14:09.768
So here l am.

14:09.940 --> 14:12.396
- Oh, sure.
- Yeah.

14:13.403 --> 14:15.728
- So, what are you gonna do now?
- l don't know.

14:15.906 --> 14:19.073
- You got any ideas? My rent's due.
- How are you at painting houses?

14:19.285 --> 14:21.527
- Better than Rembrandt.
- Can you start right away?

14:21.747 --> 14:22.826
Sure. Whose house?

14:23.040 --> 14:25.163
My dad's fiancee.
She's really desperate.

14:25.334 --> 14:26.828
Yeah, sounds perfect.

14:27.045 --> 14:28.788
Oh, Dylan, we need to motor.

14:28.964 --> 14:31.289
Oh, yeah. Gotta get home
and watch The Grapes of Wrath.

14:31.467 --> 14:33.091
Otherwise, you get stuck reading it.

14:33.303 --> 14:34.880
- lt's a great movie.
- Great book.

14:35.430 --> 14:36.628
- See you.
- Take it easy.

14:36.807 --> 14:38.800
- Bye, bro.
- Bye.

15:11.474 --> 15:13.265
Bren, what time is it? Wake up.

15:13.435 --> 15:17.729
- Bren. Bren, what time is it?
- Oh, my God. lt's 4:00 in the morning.

15:17.899 --> 15:20.105
Dad's gonna kill me.
l can't believe you fell asleep.

15:20.277 --> 15:21.736
Me? Wait a minute.

15:21.946 --> 15:24.069
Let's go.

15:24.616 --> 15:26.525
Dylan, come on.
We've gotta get out of here.

15:27.411 --> 15:30.614
Bren, relax.
Just tell him we fell asleep.

15:54.861 --> 15:56.141
Brenda?

15:56.947 --> 15:58.358
Right, Dad. Good night.
Sleep well.

15:58.532 --> 16:00.156
Do you know what time it is?

16:01.202 --> 16:03.159
Do you know how worried
your mother and l were?

16:03.372 --> 16:06.326
- Dad, l'm sorry, l fell asleep.
- Brenda, give me a break.

16:06.500 --> 16:08.327
You think l make rules
so you can ignore them?

16:08.545 --> 16:10.039
Dad, we were watching
Grapes of Wrath

16:10.213 --> 16:12.087
on TV for school and we fell asleep.

16:12.466 --> 16:14.874
- That's fine. But you have a curfew.
- Dad--

16:15.053 --> 16:18.339
How do you expect me to treat you
like an adult when you act like a child?

16:18.515 --> 16:20.840
lf l can't trust you to toe the line
when you're at home,

16:21.018 --> 16:23.224
how can l trust you
when you're on your own in Mexico?

16:23.396 --> 16:25.139
Dad, please. l said l was sorry.

16:25.357 --> 16:27.480
Brenda, it's not enough.
Not this time.

16:27.693 --> 16:28.855
What are you saying?

16:29.070 --> 16:30.897
l'm saying that
you can forget about Mexico.

16:31.114 --> 16:32.774
You just blew it.

16:42.294 --> 16:45.913
l can't believe this.
My cousin Ruth is actually coming.

16:46.842 --> 16:49.167
l thought you told me
she was afraid to fly.

16:49.595 --> 16:51.718
lt says in the note
that hypnosis cured her.

16:51.931 --> 16:53.473
lmagine that.

16:55.185 --> 16:58.352
So, what does that bring us up to,
two hundred zillion?

16:58.564 --> 17:03.939
Well, assuming no one else
accepts, 1 67.

17:04.113 --> 17:06.733
So much for a well-funded
retirement plan.

17:06.907 --> 17:08.901
Well, if it helps,
you can take one off the list.

17:09.786 --> 17:10.817
Who?

17:10.996 --> 17:13.867
Well, my dad says
if my mom goes, he won't go.

17:14.041 --> 17:16.747
And my mom says if my dad comes,
she won't come.

17:16.920 --> 17:20.289
And so, anyway, it's minus one.

17:20.465 --> 17:23.420
l'm sorry, Donna.
This must be awfully hard on you.

17:23.929 --> 17:27.464
Yeah. Well, l'll get used to it.

17:27.642 --> 17:29.053
lt's just weird.

17:29.227 --> 17:31.433
l mean, with you guys planning
a wedding

17:31.605 --> 17:34.357
and my parents' marriage
is falling apart.

17:34.567 --> 17:38.102
Well, you never know, honey,
your parents may work through this.

17:38.322 --> 17:39.650
Spoken like a true expert.

17:40.282 --> 17:42.405
- Kelly.
- Sorry.

17:42.577 --> 17:44.819
Kelly, come back here.

17:46.039 --> 17:47.498
What is her problem?

17:47.666 --> 17:51.415
Give her some time, honey.
She'll come around.

17:58.680 --> 18:01.681
You should have heard my father.
l mean, the last time l saw him like this

18:01.850 --> 18:04.637
was when Brandon was 1 1 years old
and tried to ski off the roof.

18:04.854 --> 18:06.728
You'll go to Baja
when your parents calm down.

18:06.940 --> 18:09.265
Yeah, you can still spend
the weekend at my house, right?

18:09.443 --> 18:11.270
lt's not like you're grounded
or anything.

18:11.487 --> 18:14.405
Or you can say you're staying
at Kelly's and then go to Baja anyway.

18:14.574 --> 18:17.243
- What?
- You heard me.

18:17.411 --> 18:20.946
- You mean lie?
- Well, yeah.

18:21.541 --> 18:22.916
She lies and l cover for her.

18:23.502 --> 18:25.744
- Would you?
- l don't know, Bren.

18:25.922 --> 18:29.256
lt sounds kind of risky.
What if your mom calls?

18:29.426 --> 18:31.134
Well, l'll just make sure
l call her first.

18:31.303 --> 18:32.465
That way we can head her off.

18:32.638 --> 18:34.880
When she does call,
you say that Brenda's in the shower,

18:35.058 --> 18:36.801
then you call Brenda
in Mexico at the motel,

18:36.977 --> 18:38.471
and Brenda will call her right back.

18:38.646 --> 18:41.849
- You're better at this than l thought.
- My cousin used to do it all the time.

18:42.025 --> 18:44.943
- And it worked?
- Like a charm.

18:45.112 --> 18:48.113
- l don't know.
- Kelly, please.

18:48.282 --> 18:50.109
You don't know how much
this will mean to me.

18:50.285 --> 18:51.696
ls everybody decent?

18:51.912 --> 18:54.201
- Where's your dress?
- lt doesn't fit.

18:54.415 --> 18:57.202
l gained a whole dress size.
l'm gonna look like Miss Piggy.

18:57.419 --> 18:58.498
Oh, you'll look beautiful.

18:58.712 --> 19:00.870
Thank you, Donna.
A beautiful Miss Piggy.

19:01.048 --> 19:02.625
Listen, Kelly, be a dear.

19:02.842 --> 19:05.511
l promised the new handyman
that l'd be home to give him a cheque.

19:05.679 --> 19:07.054
- Run home for me.
- Mother.

19:07.264 --> 19:08.295
Kelly, please.

19:08.474 --> 19:11.226
This guy is too good to lose
and l'm stuck here for another hour.

19:11.853 --> 19:15.436
Great. Okay. Fine.
This wedding is ruining my life.

19:16.776 --> 19:18.484
Will you girls please excuse us?

19:24.327 --> 19:27.281
Kelly, l am really getting tired
of your attitude.

19:27.456 --> 19:28.784
You've been nothing but a pill

19:28.957 --> 19:30.784
ever since Mel and l
announced our engagement.

19:31.002 --> 19:33.493
Now, l have tried to be understanding.
l really have.

19:33.672 --> 19:35.296
l even made your friends
my bridesmaids.

19:35.465 --> 19:39.130
l thought that would make you happy.
But all you can do is sulk.

19:39.303 --> 19:40.548
l'm sorry, okay?

19:40.722 --> 19:43.260
There, l apologise.
What more do you want from me?

19:43.475 --> 19:47.058
Well, for starters, l'd like you
to sound like you mean it.

20:10.884 --> 20:12.295
- Hi.
- Hi.

20:12.511 --> 20:15.678
- Who are you?
- l'm Kelly, l live here.

20:15.848 --> 20:18.719
l'm Jake Hanson.

20:20.980 --> 20:23.222
- You must be Jackie's sister.
- Daughter.

20:24.109 --> 20:25.817
One kid all grown up
and a baby on the way.

20:25.986 --> 20:29.320
- Must be a second marriage, huh?
- Fourth, but who's counting?

20:29.532 --> 20:32.652
- l guess you are.
- Excuse me?

20:34.121 --> 20:37.656
Sorry. Didn't mean to get personal.

20:39.044 --> 20:41.535
Well, l'll let you get back
to your work.

20:46.469 --> 20:49.636
- You know, it's okay.
- What is?

20:49.807 --> 20:51.384
You can get personal if you want to.

21:02.155 --> 21:06.023
l wanna go with you so bad,
but l'm not used to lying to my parents.

21:06.202 --> 21:07.862
l mean, Kelly said
she would cover for me

21:08.037 --> 21:09.864
but l don't know
if l can go through with it.

21:10.040 --> 21:13.207
So don't lie. Just tell them you're going
to Mexico with me and go.

21:13.377 --> 21:15.998
Oh, right. They'd kill me.

21:16.172 --> 21:18.414
Bren, you gotta take a stand
at some point.

21:18.592 --> 21:21.379
l mean, you can't let them treat you
like a kid forever.

21:21.554 --> 21:24.425
- Well, they say that l behave like one.
- Come on.

21:24.600 --> 21:26.509
Why, because you came home
late one night?

21:26.685 --> 21:27.716
We fell asleep.

21:28.229 --> 21:30.981
Well, l know that.
l mean, that's what l told them.

21:31.149 --> 21:33.521
But my father is being
so unreasonable.

21:33.694 --> 21:35.437
He never treats Brandon like this.

21:35.613 --> 21:38.733
He's being so sexist.
l mean, l'm really tired of it.

21:38.909 --> 21:40.902
l'm the same age as Brandon is.

21:41.078 --> 21:43.913
l deserve the same rights
and the same privileges.

21:44.082 --> 21:48.661
Bren, you don't have to convince me.
l mean, l'm on your side, remember?

21:48.838 --> 21:51.163
Fine. l've made up my mind.

21:51.341 --> 21:53.298
l'm going, whether my parents
like it or not.

22:09.154 --> 22:11.277
What are you doing, Bren,
running away?

22:11.449 --> 22:12.647
Go back to sleep, Brandon.

22:12.825 --> 22:15.363
l'm going over to Kelly's
for the weekend.

22:17.039 --> 22:19.874
- At 5 in the morning?
- Yes.

22:23.797 --> 22:25.790
You're going down to Baja with Dylan,
aren't you?

22:26.884 --> 22:28.711
Don't blow this for me, Brandon,
please.

22:30.180 --> 22:32.505
l don't believe you.
You know they're gonna hit the roof.

22:32.683 --> 22:35.352
Only if you tell them,
and l know you won't.

22:35.562 --> 22:37.436
And what, pray tell,
do you expect me to say?

22:37.648 --> 22:40.566
- That l'm at Kelly's just like l planned.
- They ain't gonna buy it.

22:41.486 --> 22:42.517
Brandon, please.

22:48.327 --> 22:51.412
All right, but it's gonna cost you
bigtime.

22:51.957 --> 22:53.784
That's Dylan. Right on time.

22:53.959 --> 22:56.035
Cover for me, Brandon.

23:11.940 --> 23:14.478
Brenda must have left for Kelly's
at the crack of dawn.

23:14.651 --> 23:16.893
l didn't even hear her.
Why'd she leave so early?

23:17.113 --> 23:19.865
She said something
about going to a flea market.

23:20.075 --> 23:22.910
Oh, l bet they're looking for
a wedding present for Jackie and Mel.

23:23.078 --> 23:24.738
Right. And you know
how those places are,

23:24.914 --> 23:27.203
you gotta get a jump
on those antique dealers.

23:27.793 --> 23:31.293
- What are we gonna get them?
- How about a crib?

23:31.464 --> 23:34.299
- Very funny.
- l wasn't kidding.

23:34.718 --> 23:36.627
Maybe l should call Kelly
and Bren and ask them.

23:36.804 --> 23:38.678
Mom, l'm sure
they're still at the flea market,

23:38.848 --> 23:41.137
and they said they're gonna
go to the movies after that.

23:41.351 --> 23:43.889
Well, l guess l can always
call them later.

23:44.104 --> 23:46.346
Or just ask Brenda
when she calls here.

23:47.817 --> 23:49.097
Right.

23:49.277 --> 23:51.982
Brandon, do you think
l was too hard on your sister?

23:52.656 --> 23:54.364
No.

23:56.119 --> 24:00.117
- You had your reasons.
- l know, but she really wanted to go.

24:00.875 --> 24:02.417
l should have
given her another chance.

24:02.627 --> 24:06.411
Don't beat yourself up about it.
l'm sure she understands.

24:15.852 --> 24:17.761
l thought you might be thirsty.

24:18.855 --> 24:20.515
Well, thanks.

24:27.991 --> 24:30.280
Gonna stand there or do you
wanna make yourself helpful?

24:30.495 --> 24:33.164
Sure, l'll help, l guess.
What can l do?

24:33.331 --> 24:37.163
- Hand me that level.
- What's a level?

24:37.336 --> 24:39.542
That long thing, right there.

24:39.714 --> 24:41.457
Okay.

24:46.681 --> 24:50.181
- So, what are you building?
- Wedding canopy.

24:51.228 --> 24:52.805
You know
your mom designed it herself?

24:53.022 --> 24:55.691
Yeah, she's making
a pretty big production out of all this.

24:55.859 --> 24:59.394
Have you seen her yet?
She's out to here:

24:59.572 --> 25:01.730
You'd think she'd wanna keep it
a little more low-key.

25:01.908 --> 25:04.066
Hey, pregnant or not,
she's still the bride.

25:04.244 --> 25:06.071
lt's her big day.
Let her have some fun.

25:06.289 --> 25:08.495
Yeah, l guess.

25:08.666 --> 25:11.453
You know, Kelly, l think
l know what your problem is.

25:11.628 --> 25:13.003
Why don't you tell me?

25:13.172 --> 25:15.544
You're a little bit hung up
on the way things used to be,

25:15.717 --> 25:18.920
instead of making your plans
for the way things are gonna be.

25:21.140 --> 25:26.681
Yeah, sort of like
having a new father,

25:26.855 --> 25:29.476
a new brother and a new baby
all at the same time.

25:31.236 --> 25:33.063
There's a world full of possibilities.

26:02.691 --> 26:05.894
You know, Bren, l can't believe
you actually went through with it.

26:06.112 --> 26:08.437
Me either. But l wouldn't
miss this trip for the world.

26:08.615 --> 26:11.901
l'm just glad you finally
stood up to your parents.

26:12.078 --> 26:14.486
Actually, l didn't.
They think that l'm at Kelly's house.

26:16.291 --> 26:18.414
- Brenda...
- Look, it'll be fine, all right?

26:18.586 --> 26:19.831
l just need to use the phone.

26:28.723 --> 26:30.680
- Hello.
- Hi, it's me.

26:30.851 --> 26:32.725
- Bren?
- ls everything cool?

26:32.937 --> 26:35.262
Yeah, so far so good.

26:36.274 --> 26:37.898
- You went to the flea market.
- What?

26:38.110 --> 26:40.399
With Kelly. That's why you left
so early this morning.

26:40.571 --> 26:42.279
Oh, right. Okay, thanks, Brandon.

26:42.448 --> 26:44.571
All right, you got it.
Just be careful, okay?

26:44.743 --> 26:46.451
Okay, okay, put Mom on.

26:46.620 --> 26:48.696
Okay, hang on. Mom, it's Bren.

26:48.873 --> 26:50.700
Tell her l said hi.

26:50.875 --> 26:54.790
- Don't you wanna talk to her?
- Well, not unless she needs me.

26:55.381 --> 26:57.872
- She doesn't even wanna talk to you.
- Wow, this is so easy.

26:58.051 --> 27:00.376
- l should do it more often.
- Don't even think about it.

27:00.554 --> 27:03.045
All right. Look, l'm gonna call
first thing in the morning.

27:03.224 --> 27:06.391
But if you need anything before then,
we'll be staying at-- What's it called?

27:06.561 --> 27:10.310
- La Boca Grande de Baja.
- La Boca Grande de Baja.

27:10.483 --> 27:11.681
Got it. Bye.

27:12.777 --> 27:14.271
Bye.

27:24.959 --> 27:27.960
- Where is everybody?
- Hey, Rosalita?

27:29.047 --> 27:32.214
Dylan, mi hijo, what's cooking?

27:32.385 --> 27:34.591
Oh, how you doing?

27:39.435 --> 27:41.178
Rosalita, l'd like you
to meet Brenda Walsh.

27:41.354 --> 27:44.059
Brenda Walsh, Rosalita Valdez.
She has the best motel on the beach.

27:44.233 --> 27:45.264
- Hi.
- Hi.

27:45.442 --> 27:48.894
How is that...? What was her name?

27:50.574 --> 27:51.653
Stacy.

27:52.701 --> 27:54.528
Stacy? Who's Stacy?

27:55.413 --> 27:57.738
Just someone l came down here
with once.

27:58.500 --> 28:00.327
You never told me about that.

28:00.503 --> 28:02.377
- lt was a long time ago.
- When?

28:03.423 --> 28:06.839
- Last summer.
- We were going out last summer.

28:07.011 --> 28:08.838
When we were broken up?

28:09.055 --> 28:10.679
You were actually seeing someone?

28:11.099 --> 28:13.222
And you brought her here?
Dylan, you lied to me.

28:13.769 --> 28:15.228
l didn't lie.

28:15.438 --> 28:18.273
l call it lying when you don't tell
someone something this important,

28:18.441 --> 28:19.816
it's the same thing.

28:19.985 --> 28:21.527
Rosalita, can we have
our keys, please?

28:21.695 --> 28:23.984
Oh, don't bother.
We're not staying.

28:52.525 --> 28:54.268
- Hello.
- Oh, hi, Kelly.

28:54.486 --> 28:57.440
Mrs. Walsh, hi. How are you?

28:57.656 --> 28:59.696
Oh, fine. Did you find anything
at the flea market?

29:00.409 --> 29:01.689
- What?
- The flea market.

29:01.870 --> 29:03.910
Brandon said you and Brenda
went to the flea market

29:04.081 --> 29:05.824
looking for wedding presents.

29:06.000 --> 29:07.198
Right.

29:07.376 --> 29:09.914
As a matter of fact, no.
There wasn't anything good there.

29:10.130 --> 29:12.288
Oh, well, better luck next time.

29:12.466 --> 29:15.551
Listen, is Brenda there?
She called just a little while ago.

29:15.720 --> 29:18.092
You've just missed her.
She ran out to get some food,

29:18.265 --> 29:21.219
and she'll be back,
and then l can have her call you.

29:21.435 --> 29:24.769
- Okay, good. Bye-bye.
- Bye.

29:26.275 --> 29:27.734
Bren, please, don't do this.

29:27.902 --> 29:30.820
We came all the way down here.
Let's not spoil the whole weekend.

29:30.989 --> 29:32.816
l'm not spoiling anything.

29:32.991 --> 29:36.325
l mean, l thought this was gonna be
the greatest weekend in my entire life

29:36.495 --> 29:37.823
and now it's ruined.

29:38.039 --> 29:40.245
lt doesn't have to be.

29:40.459 --> 29:43.626
Look, l know this great little cantina.
lt's really romantic.

29:43.796 --> 29:46.334
We could go, have dinner, talk.

29:46.550 --> 29:48.424
Start over.

29:48.594 --> 29:50.752
l don't know what l want anymore.

29:58.648 --> 30:00.272
lt's for you.

30:00.775 --> 30:02.649
- Me?
- No, her.

30:08.743 --> 30:10.202
- Hello?
- Brenda.

30:10.370 --> 30:12.446
Hi, call home pronto.

30:12.665 --> 30:14.207
- Why, what's wrong?
- Nothing yet.

30:14.375 --> 30:16.368
- But your mom called.
- Oh, God, okay.

30:16.586 --> 30:18.792
And in case she asks,
we're having Thai food for dinner

30:18.964 --> 30:20.209
and you were out picking it up.

30:20.424 --> 30:22.713
Got it.
Kel, thanks, you're a lifesaver.

30:22.886 --> 30:24.594
Okay.

30:26.140 --> 30:28.713
l'm just about finished up here
for today.

30:29.436 --> 30:31.179
Okay.

30:36.277 --> 30:39.896
So got another soda in the fridge?

30:40.074 --> 30:41.449
Sure.

30:47.082 --> 30:48.873
Thanks.

30:52.380 --> 30:55.630
So, what's a girl like you doing
home alone on a Saturday night?

30:57.595 --> 30:59.753
Well, l was just asking myself
that same question.

30:59.931 --> 31:01.342
Did you come up with any answers?

31:01.976 --> 31:04.977
Well, Brenda's in Baja with Dylan

31:05.146 --> 31:07.637
and Donna's out with David,
and that leaves me.

31:08.776 --> 31:10.650
No... No boyfriend?

31:11.153 --> 31:12.528
No.

31:14.324 --> 31:16.198
- You don't have to rub it in.
- Sorry.

31:16.785 --> 31:18.825
You told me to get personal.

31:21.291 --> 31:24.209
Listen, my mom's at Lamaze class.

31:24.378 --> 31:26.002
And l was just nuking some lasagne.

31:26.172 --> 31:28.663
lf you're hungry,
you could stay for dinner.

31:28.884 --> 31:30.877
l mean, if you're not busy
or anything.

31:31.053 --> 31:33.010
No, no, l'm not busy.

31:33.181 --> 31:34.461
l'm starved.

31:35.475 --> 31:39.639
Great. l mean, l wouldn't want
this food to go to waste.

31:39.855 --> 31:41.266
Yeah.

31:48.324 --> 31:49.438
Smells great.

31:49.659 --> 31:51.236
Yeah, l love lasagne.

31:51.912 --> 31:53.739
Not talking about the lasagne.

32:02.008 --> 32:04.166
- Hello?
- Mom, hi, it's me.

32:04.344 --> 32:06.004
Oh, hi, honey.

32:06.179 --> 32:08.219
- Kelly said you called.
- Oh, yeah.

32:08.390 --> 32:09.635
You know, l was just wondering,

32:09.809 --> 32:11.303
have Jackie and Mel
mentioned anything

32:11.478 --> 32:13.020
that might make
a good wedding present?

32:13.230 --> 32:14.558
No, nothing specific.

32:14.773 --> 32:17.181
Kelly said you two didn't have
any luck at the flea market.

32:17.402 --> 32:18.944
Right.

32:19.112 --> 32:21.733
l was thinking of something
along the lines of glassware.

32:21.907 --> 32:24.659
Great idea. l mean,
everybody needs glassware.

32:24.827 --> 32:27.781
So are you two doing
anything special tonight?

32:27.998 --> 32:29.872
- What?
- You and Kelly.

32:30.042 --> 32:31.750
Got any plans?

32:31.919 --> 32:34.375
No, we're probably
just gonna eat takeout Thai food

32:34.548 --> 32:35.746
and rent a video or something.

32:35.966 --> 32:37.626
Okay, well, have a good time.

32:37.843 --> 32:39.836
Okay, you too. See you tomorrow.

32:41.598 --> 32:42.712
Everything okay?

32:43.851 --> 32:45.131
Fine.

32:45.311 --> 32:48.930
- Lot of elaborate plans for nothing.
- l can't believe l even came.

32:49.149 --> 32:52.150
Well, it's too late to turn back now.

32:53.195 --> 32:56.030
- Rosalita, do you have two rooms?
- Sure, of course.

32:58.160 --> 33:01.529
- Separate rooms. You happy now?
- Yes, l am. Thank you.

33:02.499 --> 33:05.120
You're gonna have to eat,
and l don't think you wanna be going

33:05.294 --> 33:07.785
to any of the local establishments
by yourself.

33:08.381 --> 33:12.296
- Well, maybe l do.
- Well, maybe you don't.

33:17.559 --> 33:19.884
So how long is it gonna take you
to finish up around here?

33:20.062 --> 33:21.936
About a week, l guess.

33:22.106 --> 33:24.562
Really? That's great.

33:24.734 --> 33:26.014
l mean, it's great for you.

33:26.987 --> 33:28.232
You gonna be around?

33:28.447 --> 33:31.116
Why? You need someone
to hold your level?

33:33.036 --> 33:34.578
Yeah. Maybe.

33:36.999 --> 33:39.834
Well, maybe it's good that my mother
has such big plans, then.

33:40.045 --> 33:43.248
Oh, you know, maybe you should
tell her to add on a nursery.

33:43.424 --> 33:46.342
- That could take months.
- l could probably arrange that.

33:47.137 --> 33:49.343
We don't want the baby, like,
sharing your room, do we?

33:49.515 --> 33:50.974
Don't even think it.

33:52.435 --> 33:54.926
You know, you talk a good game,
but when that baby comes,

33:55.105 --> 33:57.561
you're gonna be cooing
and cuddling with the best of them.

33:57.733 --> 33:59.476
- Think so?
- Of course.

33:59.652 --> 34:02.737
They're so little and sweet and...

34:02.906 --> 34:06.156
Even a tough cookie
like you is gonna melt.

34:06.327 --> 34:08.485
ls that what you think l am?
A tough cookie?

34:09.706 --> 34:12.031
lsn't that what you want people
to think?

34:12.208 --> 34:15.828
No. l don't know,
l never really thought about it.

34:16.965 --> 34:18.839
Maybe you should.

34:21.679 --> 34:23.755
Who could that be?

34:27.812 --> 34:30.516
- Hey.
- Steve, what are you doing here?

34:30.690 --> 34:33.561
l was driving by, l saw your light on,
l figured l'd come and say hey.

34:34.195 --> 34:36.947
- l'm really tired.
- That's all right, l won't stay long.

34:37.157 --> 34:39.446
No, actually it's not
a good time for me.

34:44.916 --> 34:45.947
Hi.

34:46.627 --> 34:48.583
Working a little late, aren't we?

34:48.879 --> 34:51.833
Yeah, actually, it was a long day
and l made Jake some dinner.

34:53.135 --> 34:55.507
Since when can you cook?

34:56.389 --> 34:58.678
- Anything left for me?
- lt's all gone.

34:59.642 --> 35:02.928
Oh, l get it.
A little tea for two, huh?

35:03.898 --> 35:05.522
Well, don't let me get in the way.

35:05.733 --> 35:07.560
Steve, wait.

35:14.494 --> 35:15.739
Steve and l used to go out.

35:18.207 --> 35:20.959
He's still pretty hung up
on you, huh?

35:21.127 --> 35:22.835
Yeah, l guess he is.

35:23.922 --> 35:25.998
How about you?
You ever have any second thoughts?

35:26.217 --> 35:28.506
About Steve? No.

35:28.678 --> 35:30.089
l mean, he's a great guy

35:30.263 --> 35:34.842
and we'll always be friends,
but it is definitely over.

35:35.687 --> 35:38.059
- Definitely?
- Definitely.

35:51.164 --> 35:52.492
Maybe l should go.

35:52.666 --> 35:55.667
Yeah, maybe you should.

36:02.011 --> 36:03.719
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

36:05.807 --> 36:08.892
l'll see you tomorrow morning.
Bright and early.

36:10.146 --> 36:11.854
Bright and early.

36:25.623 --> 36:27.781
l can't believe you're doing this.

36:27.959 --> 36:29.121
What?

36:29.294 --> 36:31.536
We're in one of the most
romantic places on the planet.

36:31.714 --> 36:33.707
The waves out there are cresting
in the moonlight.

36:33.883 --> 36:36.456
The food in here is great.
The people, friendliest in the world.

36:36.637 --> 36:38.795
And you're wasting it all
because of some stupid girl.

36:39.015 --> 36:41.506
Some stupid girl named Stacy,
and l'm not wasting anything.

36:41.685 --> 36:43.843
l am eating my food
and having a wonderful time.

36:44.730 --> 36:47.138
- Me too.
- Well, good.

36:47.316 --> 36:50.650
Yeah, we're having
a wonderful time.

37:42.009 --> 37:45.425
Feelings

37:46.055 --> 37:54.182
Nothing more than feelings

37:56.151 --> 38:00.019
- Dylan, l'm so sorry.
- Yeah, me too.

38:02.534 --> 38:04.823
Are toasts any good when
they're made with ginger ale?

38:05.246 --> 38:06.621
l think they work even better.

38:07.290 --> 38:10.825
Here's to you and freedom.

38:11.295 --> 38:14.664
And a wonderful weekend
in Mexico.

38:21.307 --> 38:24.142
- Make it a double, bartender.
- You must be hurting.

38:24.311 --> 38:26.102
What will it be, chocolate or vanilla?

38:26.271 --> 38:28.180
One of each.

38:29.192 --> 38:30.271
Normally in this situation,

38:30.443 --> 38:33.278
l'd ask the customer whether it was
love or money, but in your case--

38:33.447 --> 38:35.356
lt's love. Definitely love.

38:35.574 --> 38:37.401
Let me guess.
Long blond hair, blue eyes?

38:37.911 --> 38:39.109
Yeah.

38:39.287 --> 38:42.122
Used to be l can go to Kelly's house
any hour of the day or night.

38:42.374 --> 38:44.367
She'd even sneak me
up the stairs to her room.

38:44.544 --> 38:46.121
Tonight, she wouldn't even let me in.

38:46.922 --> 38:49.923
- She really laid it on the line, huh?
- She had a guy there.

38:50.843 --> 38:53.168
- So what?
- That guy Jake.

38:53.346 --> 38:55.339
- Dylan's friend?
- Yeah.

38:55.516 --> 38:57.425
The one he said left
all those girls in a drift.

38:57.852 --> 38:59.928
So, what are you moping about?
This is great.

39:00.105 --> 39:03.023
Whose shoulder do you think Kelly will
come crying on when he dumps her?

39:03.192 --> 39:05.434
Yeah, well, maybe
l'm getting sick of waiting.

39:05.611 --> 39:07.022
Congratulations. lt's about time.

39:07.530 --> 39:10.484
- Yeah, you think so?
- Yeah, l do.

39:10.659 --> 39:12.533
l think you gotta move on
once and for all.

39:12.745 --> 39:15.663
- Yeah, well, maybe l can't.
- Why not?

39:16.917 --> 39:18.328
l'm still in love with her.

39:23.633 --> 39:25.210
Kelly?

39:26.011 --> 39:27.671
Hi, guys. How was Lamaze?

39:27.889 --> 39:30.012
- lt was very educational.
- Boring.

39:30.183 --> 39:32.756
Honey, it was not.
That movie was great.

39:32.937 --> 39:34.680
Trust me, Mel,
l have done this before.

39:34.856 --> 39:37.561
l don't need to take lessons
on how to have a baby.

39:40.029 --> 39:41.404
Wait a minute.

39:41.572 --> 39:44.277
Am l hearing things,
or were you just laughing?

39:44.451 --> 39:47.322
- What do you mean?
- l don't know.

39:47.496 --> 39:49.572
You just sound happy, that's all.

39:50.291 --> 39:53.078
And what is wrong with that?
Good night.

39:53.295 --> 39:55.003
Wait a minute.

39:55.506 --> 39:56.881
Come here.

39:57.050 --> 39:58.758
What?

39:59.636 --> 40:01.593
l just wanna hug you.

40:02.723 --> 40:04.680
That's all.

40:07.020 --> 40:10.140
- Oh, my God. What was that?
- What are you talking about?

40:10.316 --> 40:12.143
- That.
- Oh, you mean the baby kicking?

40:13.278 --> 40:17.228
- That's the first time l've ever felt it.
- Well, here, it's doing it again.

40:44.983 --> 40:50.226
- Not bad for a farm girl.
- Come here. Closer.

40:50.407 --> 40:52.732
l'll never forget this night
as long as l live.

40:52.910 --> 40:55.697
- Me neither.
- Let's dance like this all night.

40:55.872 --> 40:59.122
Well, not all night.

41:13.226 --> 41:15.978
Oh, the water is so warm and clean.

41:16.147 --> 41:17.689
What did l tell you?

41:17.857 --> 41:19.731
So how'd l do? Am l a surfer yet?

41:19.901 --> 41:22.439
Bren, you redefine
The Endless Summer.

41:22.613 --> 41:24.819
Are you joking? l'm stoked.

41:24.991 --> 41:26.734
l was hot. l was thrashing.

41:26.952 --> 41:29.241
You stood up for a second.

41:29.413 --> 41:31.702
Oh, no, actually it was two seconds.

41:31.874 --> 41:33.617
You were great.

41:42.262 --> 41:45.133
We better go before the Porsche
turns into a pumpkin.

41:45.308 --> 41:46.422
Do we have to?

41:46.601 --> 41:48.510
Yeah, it's either that
or you call Jimbo

41:48.687 --> 41:50.561
and ask if we can stay down
here another week.

41:50.731 --> 41:52.771
Adios, Mexico.

42:07.001 --> 42:09.077
Dylan, what's wrong?
Why'd they make you pull over?

42:09.254 --> 42:13.086
Oh, it's just a random thing, Bren.
They stop every tenth car.

42:16.054 --> 42:17.845
- Welcome home, folks.
- Thanks.

42:18.014 --> 42:19.508
Just need to see some lD.

42:19.683 --> 42:21.676
Sure thing.

42:22.937 --> 42:25.891
- Nice car.
- Yeah, you can search it if you want.

42:26.066 --> 42:28.771
Nope. Just a random check.

42:28.944 --> 42:31.186
Need to see yours, young lady
and you'll be on your way.

42:31.364 --> 42:32.941
- Excuse me?
- Your driver's licence.

42:33.575 --> 42:35.484
lt was in my purse
the night of the robbery.

42:35.661 --> 42:37.737
l applied for a new one,
but it didn't come yet.

42:37.956 --> 42:41.740
That's okay. A birth certificate
or a passport's just as good.

42:41.919 --> 42:44.956
- l don't have either of those.
- Then we got a problem.

42:45.173 --> 42:47.664
Listen,
she's just as American as l am.

42:48.218 --> 42:49.795
l'm sure she is.

42:49.970 --> 42:52.093
But since the latest lNS crackdown,

42:52.265 --> 42:54.673
we've got some pretty strict regulations
down here.

42:54.851 --> 42:56.974
Well, can't you just punch me
into a computer?

42:57.146 --> 43:00.432
l'll give you my social security number,
anything. l've got to get home.

43:00.608 --> 43:02.814
l'd love to help you, young lady.
Really, l would.

43:02.986 --> 43:05.524
But anybody could come down here
and claim they were you

43:05.698 --> 43:07.073
and give me a number.

43:07.242 --> 43:09.199
So, what am l gonna do?

43:09.369 --> 43:12.240
- How old are you?
- Seventeen.

43:12.456 --> 43:14.864
- No problem, we'll call your parents.
- You can't do that.

43:15.627 --> 43:16.658
Why not?

43:16.878 --> 43:20.081
Because her parents don't exactly
know that we're down here.

43:23.345 --> 43:25.254
Hey, l'm sorry.

43:25.431 --> 43:27.589
But we're gonna have to get
a legal guardian down here

43:27.808 --> 43:29.516
with your birth certificate.

43:29.686 --> 43:33.351
Failing that, they'll have to sign
a sworn affidavit verifying you a citizen.

43:34.609 --> 43:38.061
Unless maybe you're not
an American citizen.

43:38.238 --> 43:39.269
Of course l am.

43:39.448 --> 43:42.485
lt's just that if you call my parents,
l'm a dead American citizen.

43:43.161 --> 43:45.782
- Dylan, what are we gonna do?
- You heard the man.

43:45.956 --> 43:48.281
Looks like we're gonna
have to call your father.
