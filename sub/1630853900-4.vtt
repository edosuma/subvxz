00:22.423 --> 00:24.125
<i>Previously
on</i> Raising Kanan...

00:24.158 --> 00:26.026
This is what this nigga do.

00:26.060 --> 00:29.096
When he wants my attention,
he fucks with my world.

00:29.130 --> 00:30.698
I don't even remember
what happened that night,

00:30.731 --> 00:32.366
so you talking
to the wrong guy.

00:32.400 --> 00:33.434
But I don't know
if I believe him.

00:33.467 --> 00:34.668
Feels like there's more there,

00:34.702 --> 00:36.604
but whenever I try digging,
he gets pissed at me

00:36.637 --> 00:38.038
and tells me to leave it alone.

00:38.072 --> 00:39.273
I want you out!

00:39.306 --> 00:41.475
Where am I gonna go?
I don't have any money.

00:41.509 --> 00:42.610
I been hooking up this brother

00:42.643 --> 00:44.078
with free studio time
for his girl.

00:44.111 --> 00:45.513
I know they got some buildings
around the way.

00:51.118 --> 00:52.486
- You remember my mom at all?
- Course.

00:52.520 --> 00:53.721
<i>She lives in Harlem.</i>

00:53.754 --> 00:55.556
<i>Divorced twice, no kids.</i>

00:55.589 --> 00:57.558
Your whole life, you been
thinking Def Con your daddy,

00:57.591 --> 00:59.794
but he ain't.

00:59.827 --> 01:01.762
I am.

01:01.796 --> 01:04.265
He don't know what's real
and what isn't.

01:04.298 --> 01:07.401
We already up in Baisley's
and the Forties.

01:07.435 --> 01:09.236
We really need to fuck
with Jersey right now?

01:09.270 --> 01:11.539
We franchisin', fellas.

02:07.428 --> 02:08.696
<i>Ha ha. That's right.</i>

03:35.316 --> 03:36.717
<i>Everybody's schemin'.</i>

03:38.886 --> 03:41.555
<i>Everybody got their own plan,</i>

03:41.589 --> 03:43.657
<i>their agenda,</i>

03:43.691 --> 03:45.492
<i>their motherfuckin' angle...</i>

04:01.976 --> 04:04.878
<i>...'cause everybody chasin'
that same paper.</i>

04:08.882 --> 04:10.851
Get the fuck out!

04:31.639 --> 04:32.873
Nothin' come into Newark

04:32.906 --> 04:35.676
without Sal Boselli
getting his piece.

04:42.816 --> 04:45.686
<i>That's the way
of the motherfuckin' world.</i>

04:45.719 --> 04:47.888
<i>Survival of the fittest
up in here.</i>

04:52.826 --> 04:53.894
<i>Brushstrokes'll tell you</i>

04:53.927 --> 04:54.995
<i>everything you need to know.</i>

04:57.464 --> 04:59.767
The precision. The dexterity.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.869
They're a story
unto themselves.

05:03.771 --> 05:06.707
A true artist isn't concerned
with the marketplace, no.

05:06.740 --> 05:11.078
They're consumed by their own
vision and inspiration.

05:11.311 --> 05:12.646
Yeah, but if nobody buyin'
what you selling,

05:12.680 --> 05:15.315
you just a sucker
holdin' a brush.

05:16.784 --> 05:19.586
And by the way...
you ain't fooling nobody

05:19.620 --> 05:21.455
with that fancy
fuckin' talk of yours.

05:21.488 --> 05:23.991
I know who you are,
and I know where you from.

05:25.659 --> 05:27.027
Fort Greene
up in this motherfucker.

05:28.562 --> 05:30.631
Well, I speak differently
in different situations, Raq.

05:30.664 --> 05:34.568
- Mm.
- In the gallery, I'm Cartier.

05:34.601 --> 05:36.970
On the streets,
I'm still Cartier.

05:37.004 --> 05:39.673
I just roll a lot harder.

05:42.710 --> 05:45.746
I'm surprised that you'd even
join me this evening.

05:47.381 --> 05:50.551
I thought you were
completely disinterested in me

05:50.584 --> 05:52.820
when I met you
at Lou's recording studio.

05:52.853 --> 05:55.389
I had a lot goin' on that day.

05:55.422 --> 05:57.991
- But I'm here now.
- Indeed.

05:59.460 --> 06:02.062
I'm tryin' to figure out
how it is you do what you do,

06:02.096 --> 06:03.931
how you done what you did.

06:03.964 --> 06:06.066
Living downtown,
coppin' paintings

06:06.100 --> 06:08.502
and talkin' like you spend
summers at the Inkwell.

06:08.535 --> 06:11.004
Hmm, the only limitations
that we have

06:11.038 --> 06:12.940
are the ones
we place on ourselves.

06:14.942 --> 06:16.844
You're different.

06:16.877 --> 06:18.579
You into different shit.

06:19.613 --> 06:22.049
Like this art noise.

06:22.082 --> 06:24.551
Tsh, I don't get it.

06:24.585 --> 06:25.919
This ain't me.

06:25.953 --> 06:30.724
Raq, what do you have
too much of in your business?

06:30.758 --> 06:32.526
- Drama.

06:33.627 --> 06:34.962
No.

06:34.995 --> 06:38.031
I'm talking about that thing
that you can touch and hold

06:38.065 --> 06:40.567
but you can't get rid of.

06:40.601 --> 06:42.469
What it's all for.

06:42.503 --> 06:43.937
What you worked so hard--

06:43.971 --> 06:47.608
Cash.

06:47.641 --> 06:49.476
Got so much,
I got rats gnawin' on it.

06:53.881 --> 06:56.116
Motherfucker.

06:56.150 --> 06:57.851
You washing your money
up in here.

06:59.820 --> 07:01.021
You pay cash
for all this art shit,

07:01.054 --> 07:03.123
you flip it,
and then you make it clean.

07:03.157 --> 07:04.658
You're a quick study, Raq.

07:04.691 --> 07:06.593
I like that about you.

07:08.128 --> 07:09.997
Amongst other things.

07:43.530 --> 07:46.567
They told me I had family
waiting on me.

07:46.600 --> 07:48.035
Who the fuck are you?

07:48.068 --> 07:49.636
Kanan.

07:51.071 --> 07:52.573
Kanan Stark.

07:53.740 --> 07:54.808
Def Con's son.

07:54.842 --> 07:56.543
Raq's kid?

07:57.578 --> 07:59.746
Damn. Kanan!

07:59.780 --> 08:01.181
Yo, the last time I seen you,

08:01.215 --> 08:03.183
you was just
a little nigga, man, a baby.

08:03.217 --> 08:05.118
Now you all grown up.

08:05.152 --> 08:06.720
All diesel and shit.

08:08.522 --> 08:09.923
Why the fuck you here, man?

08:09.957 --> 08:12.159
'Cause I can't do nothin'
for you, Kanan.

08:12.192 --> 08:13.594
Don't even bother asking.

08:13.627 --> 08:15.762
I just wanna talk
about my father.

08:16.930 --> 08:18.065
Talk, then, nigga.

08:18.866 --> 08:20.634
Shit, well, I just wanna know
what kinda stuff

08:20.667 --> 08:21.969
he used to say about me.

08:23.003 --> 08:25.739
I mean, shit,
did he even talk about me?

08:25.772 --> 08:27.674
You was nothin' but a baby, man.

08:28.842 --> 08:30.277
There wasn't much to say.

08:32.813 --> 08:34.982
So...

08:35.015 --> 08:37.517
what Raq say Def said?

08:39.152 --> 08:42.055
She used to tell me stories
about how smart he was.

08:42.089 --> 08:43.824
Word.

08:43.857 --> 08:46.059
How he had mad respect
on the street.

08:46.860 --> 08:48.195
Correct.

08:48.228 --> 08:50.731
Yo, Def had the whole Southside
on lock, man.

08:50.764 --> 08:53.100
And he's definitely
my father, right?

08:53.133 --> 08:54.201
The fuck you just ask me?

08:54.234 --> 08:56.003
<i>Is he definitely your daddy?</i>

08:56.036 --> 08:58.739
Who the fuck else
is gonna be your daddy, huh?

08:58.772 --> 09:00.140
What, what,
is-is Raq telling you

09:00.173 --> 09:01.708
that she was with another nigga
at the time?

09:01.742 --> 09:03.110
Whoa. Nah, nah, nah.

09:03.143 --> 09:05.012
Nah, it's-it's nothin'--
it's nothin' like that.

09:06.013 --> 09:07.781
People just been sayin' shit.

09:07.814 --> 09:10.117
People always say shit, Kanan,

09:10.150 --> 09:11.718
especially when a nigga
ain't around no more

09:11.752 --> 09:12.986
to defend hisself.

09:14.288 --> 09:16.156
You remind me of Def.

09:16.189 --> 09:18.292
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah,
you got the same eyes, man,</i>

09:18.325 --> 09:20.127
<i>the same heart.</i>

09:20.160 --> 09:21.595
<i>And he would've did
what you doin'.</i>

09:21.628 --> 09:23.864
He would've came down here
to look me in my face

09:23.897 --> 09:25.999
and ask me those questions.

09:26.033 --> 09:28.268
<i>You a man now, Kanan.</i>

09:28.302 --> 09:29.836
<i>Shit, by the time
Def was your age,</i>

09:29.870 --> 09:31.838
he was already runnin' corners,

09:31.872 --> 09:33.040
livin' in his own crib,

09:33.073 --> 09:35.108
runnin' up into any bitch
he wanted.

09:37.711 --> 09:38.679
Hey.

09:38.712 --> 09:40.213
It's time to get it, Kanan.

09:41.915 --> 09:43.917
Just like your daddy.

09:43.951 --> 09:45.886
<i>Time's up, Stark.</i>

09:45.919 --> 09:48.121
Hey, don't forget
about your Uncle Vernon

09:48.155 --> 09:50.157
and his commissary, a'ight?

09:50.190 --> 09:52.993
<i>The price for smokes
done gone up in here.</i>

10:08.041 --> 10:09.009
I knew going out there

10:09.042 --> 10:10.210
was more trouble
than it's worth.

10:10.243 --> 10:11.745
Do Marv and Raq know?

10:12.946 --> 10:14.915
Then why you callin' me?
Call them.

10:14.948 --> 10:16.984
I told you
I ain't fuckin' with Jersey.

10:24.291 --> 10:25.659
Lou.

10:26.259 --> 10:27.327
Is this a joke?

10:28.261 --> 10:29.963
What joke?

10:29.997 --> 10:30.964
Who got jokes?

10:32.065 --> 10:33.066
Oh, shit.

10:34.334 --> 10:35.736
I mean, I had to get rid
of the board

10:35.769 --> 10:37.037
just to take care of some
of these expenses, Lou.

10:37.070 --> 10:38.805
But it's all good.

10:38.839 --> 10:40.741
I already found another one.

10:40.774 --> 10:42.242
I'm in negotiations
with it right now.

10:42.275 --> 10:44.778
How far along
are these negotiations, Crown?

10:44.811 --> 10:46.747
Because I ain't an expert
at this shit like you,

10:46.780 --> 10:49.049
but I'm pretty fuckin' sure
we need a mixin' board,

10:49.082 --> 10:50.417
or we can't do shit.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.252
I got it handled, Lou,

10:52.285 --> 10:53.754
so you just relax.

10:57.324 --> 10:58.959
I am relaxed.

11:06.933 --> 11:09.002
You just don't wanna
see me agitated, all right?

11:16.009 --> 11:17.210
I'm on the road.

11:18.745 --> 11:21.715
Ain't shit I can do
about Jersey right now.

11:21.748 --> 11:24.885
Raq had me take Kanan up north
to go see his daddy brother.

11:26.286 --> 11:27.821
Call Lou!

11:39.299 --> 11:41.835
I hope the shit was worth it,

11:41.868 --> 11:43.236
<i>'cause the whole
fuckin' world done blowed up</i>

11:43.270 --> 11:45.806
while you tradin' stories
with bitch-ass Vernon.

11:47.274 --> 11:48.875
You know Vernon
used to stick up old ladies

11:48.909 --> 11:50.844
for they welfare money, right?

11:50.877 --> 11:52.312
Scandalous motherfucker.

11:52.345 --> 11:54.915
Didn't care about nobody
but hisself.

11:54.948 --> 11:56.349
That's your other uncle.

11:56.383 --> 11:57.851
<i>So...</i>

12:00.387 --> 12:01.822
...he tell you anything
you didn't already know

12:01.855 --> 12:02.989
about your daddy?

12:05.125 --> 12:07.961
I don't even know what I know
and what I don't know.

12:07.994 --> 12:09.996
<i>Then let me tell you
what you do know.</i>

12:10.030 --> 12:12.165
You got a mother that love you

12:12.199 --> 12:14.067
more than anything
on this goddamn green Earth

12:14.101 --> 12:15.302
<i>and a family around you</i>

12:15.335 --> 12:16.903
<i>that got your back
at all times.</i>

12:16.937 --> 12:18.972
<i>That's all any nigga
can ask for.</i>

12:19.005 --> 12:20.307
Point is...

12:22.109 --> 12:25.011
...only motherfuckers who count
are the ones who are here.

12:25.045 --> 12:26.179
<i>They the ones who got you.</i>

12:26.213 --> 12:27.848
<i>They the ones
lookin' out for you.</i>

12:28.782 --> 12:30.517
Yeah, and-and maybe
they ain't perfect.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.319
Maybe they ain't
who you want 'em to be,

12:32.352 --> 12:34.754
but they here for you.

12:37.791 --> 12:40.127
And that's all that matters.

13:23.203 --> 13:24.304
<i>Hello.</i>

13:28.508 --> 13:29.976
<i>Somebody there?</i>

13:36.883 --> 13:38.385
It's Laverne.

13:38.418 --> 13:40.187
Laverne Thomas.

14:00.340 --> 14:01.841
Laverne.

14:05.845 --> 14:07.948
Obviously, this is a surprise.

14:09.216 --> 14:10.584
A wonderful surprise.

14:13.553 --> 14:16.089
Where are my manners?
Uh, come in.

14:18.325 --> 14:20.860
Come in. Take off your coat.

14:51.258 --> 14:53.593
I, uh--I volunteer
with the youth group

14:53.627 --> 14:55.295
at my church.

14:55.328 --> 14:57.497
They're wonderful kids.

14:57.530 --> 14:59.132
I'd love for you
to meet 'em sometime.

15:03.270 --> 15:05.205
Only if you want to.

15:06.973 --> 15:08.508
Thanks for the drink.

15:10.677 --> 15:12.979
- How's Marvin?

15:13.013 --> 15:15.982
- He's Marvin.

15:16.016 --> 15:17.350
"He's Marvin."

15:22.522 --> 15:25.125
I'm moved to have you
in my home,

15:25.158 --> 15:26.459
to put my eyes on you.

15:28.128 --> 15:29.996
I don't even know what to say.

15:32.599 --> 15:33.566
When I saw you
at my church that day--

15:33.600 --> 15:35.535
Why did you leave me?

15:37.537 --> 15:39.639
You just jump right in,
don't you?

15:40.407 --> 15:42.942
I wasn't even a year old,
and you just bounced.

15:44.678 --> 15:46.246
I wanna know why.

15:48.581 --> 15:49.549
Um...

15:57.524 --> 15:59.292
...I was young, Laverne.

16:02.228 --> 16:04.297
Not much older
than you are right now.

16:06.199 --> 16:08.268
All of a sudden,

16:08.301 --> 16:11.237
I had a new baby
and a man I wasn't sure about.

16:12.105 --> 16:13.440
I was scared.

16:15.175 --> 16:17.110
So I did
what scared children do.

16:19.412 --> 16:21.014
I ran away.

16:22.248 --> 16:24.984
I went to Los Angeles
thinking I'd become some...

16:25.018 --> 16:26.453
famous singer.

16:27.987 --> 16:29.656
Once I was rich,

16:29.689 --> 16:31.624
I was gonna come back
and get you.

16:34.294 --> 16:36.363
But it didn't work out
how I planned.

16:39.032 --> 16:40.700
Instead I got caught up
with the wrong things

16:40.734 --> 16:42.602
and the wrong people,

16:42.635 --> 16:46.272
and by the time I looked up,
ten years had passed by,

16:46.306 --> 16:48.375
and I figured just popping
back up in your life

16:48.408 --> 16:50.343
would be worse than leaving it
in the first place.

16:54.080 --> 16:55.482
It wouldn't have been worse.

17:00.687 --> 17:03.723
God is so great, Laverne...

17:06.593 --> 17:08.495
...'cause He brought you
back to me.

17:10.029 --> 17:11.431
Right here, right now.

17:14.634 --> 17:15.635
And I--

17:18.671 --> 17:21.141
I know I don't deserve you...

17:25.745 --> 17:28.615
...but somewhere in His grace,

17:28.648 --> 17:31.117
He decided that a child
should be with her mother.

17:32.752 --> 17:34.521
That you should be with me.

17:38.425 --> 17:40.693
I'm not asking for forgiveness.

17:40.727 --> 17:42.796
I'm asking for a chance.

18:15.662 --> 18:17.297
How'd everything go
with your Uncle Vernon?

18:17.330 --> 18:18.465
It was a'ight.

18:18.498 --> 18:19.499
He didn't really have much
to say about--

18:19.532 --> 18:20.467
<i>Yo, my bad.</i>

18:23.470 --> 18:25.371
Got caught up at the studio.

18:26.573 --> 18:28.374
Hey, hey, babe, uh,
go watch some TV.

18:28.408 --> 18:30.109
Give me a minute
with your uncles.

18:36.449 --> 18:37.884
What the hell is that smell?

18:38.117 --> 18:40.286
<i>Rat dead in the walls
or some shit.</i>

18:40.320 --> 18:41.554
<i>There's some air freshener
in there.</i>

18:41.588 --> 18:43.690
Just spray it around.

18:45.258 --> 18:47.360
It smells really bad in here.

18:47.393 --> 18:50.263
It's air freshener, nigga.
It freshens the air.

18:54.834 --> 18:56.636
So, what,
we ain't workin' today?

18:56.669 --> 18:58.271
Sent everybody home
till we figure out

18:58.304 --> 18:59.539
what the fuck happened
out in Jersey.

18:59.572 --> 19:01.708
Not tryin' to have those
Italians bum-rush this spot.

19:01.741 --> 19:03.409
All right, so what do we know?

19:03.443 --> 19:05.879
We know...
...we in a world of shit.

19:06.846 --> 19:08.615
An Islamic court
has sentenced them

19:08.648 --> 19:10.884
to lose their right arms,
have them severed,

19:10.917 --> 19:11.918
and their left leg...

19:12.151 --> 19:13.419
What the--

19:13.453 --> 19:14.654
<i>...severe punishment,
of course,</i>

19:14.687 --> 19:16.356
<i>uh, for a first offense especially.</i>

19:16.389 --> 19:17.624
<i>Tomorrow their mother
will be on the show</i>

19:17.657 --> 19:18.858
<i>to speak out
about their predicament.</i>

19:18.892 --> 19:20.760
Oh!

19:20.793 --> 19:23.196
What the fuck?

19:24.731 --> 19:27.433
Yo, this shit
smell horrible, man.

19:27.467 --> 19:29.502
Ugh!

20:30.296 --> 20:32.899
I told you movin'
to Jersey gonna be a problem.

20:32.932 --> 20:34.734
Bein' on the wrong
side of them Italians

20:34.767 --> 20:36.436
is not a place
we wanna be, Raq.

20:36.469 --> 20:38.304
Them Italians don't play.

20:38.338 --> 20:39.505
We fucked up.

20:39.539 --> 20:40.573
We should've got
the lay of the land

20:40.607 --> 20:41.774
before we set up shop.

20:41.808 --> 20:43.343
Now we got a problem.

20:43.376 --> 20:45.545
This job, what I do,
it's not about moving product.

20:45.578 --> 20:48.414
It's about solving problems
every day.

20:48.448 --> 20:50.717
Whether it's the nigga
on our team skimmin' from us,

20:50.750 --> 20:52.952
the supplier raisin'
the price of a key,

20:52.986 --> 20:54.821
or these fuckin' Italians
jackin' our shit,

20:54.854 --> 20:57.423
every day is a new problem
that's gotta get solved.

20:57.457 --> 20:58.558
That's the job.
That's the work.

20:58.591 --> 20:59.859
That's the hustle.

20:59.892 --> 21:01.794
And ain't nobody who ever
made real money in this game

21:01.828 --> 21:02.996
a drug dealer.

21:03.029 --> 21:04.297
They problem solvers.

21:04.330 --> 21:06.265
Some problems
bigger than others.

21:06.299 --> 21:09.435
Maybe we should press pause
on this shit in Jersey

21:09.469 --> 21:10.670
until the dust settles.

21:10.703 --> 21:13.706
You know, let shit cool off
for a minute.

21:13.740 --> 21:16.576
You so ready to damn roll over

21:16.609 --> 21:18.511
so you can get back
to your fuckin' studio.

21:18.544 --> 21:20.279
- It ain't even about that.
-  It is.

21:20.313 --> 21:21.848
Course it is.

21:23.716 --> 21:26.853
Look, ain't nobody gonna
tell me where I can

21:26.886 --> 21:28.588
or I can't do business.

21:28.621 --> 21:30.690
Not the Italians
and not neither of you.

21:31.924 --> 21:33.459
Set up a meeting
with these pizza motherfuckers.

21:55.448 --> 21:57.483
<i>Hola, mami.</i>

22:05.358 --> 22:07.694
You know, I believe we got off
on the wrong foot.

22:08.795 --> 22:10.363
It's no hard feelings.

22:10.396 --> 22:12.565
Just business.

22:12.598 --> 22:14.033
Never personal.

22:25.011 --> 22:28.114
Take good care of yourself,
my love.

22:34.387 --> 22:36.756
Know what? You keep the change.

22:38.124 --> 22:41.127
We gonna call this one even,
a'ight?

23:07.787 --> 23:09.589
Hey, yo, Raq.

23:09.622 --> 23:11.057
Hey, Kanan,
let me holler at your moms

23:11.090 --> 23:12.425
for a second alone.

23:12.458 --> 23:14.026
I'm not eight no more, man.

23:14.060 --> 23:15.394
Come on, y'all can talk.

23:15.428 --> 23:16.395
I'm tired of y'all
pushing me to the curb

23:16.429 --> 23:17.463
when y'all do this.

23:17.497 --> 23:18.464
Look, just give us
a minute, baby.

23:18.498 --> 23:19.499
Ma.

23:20.733 --> 23:22.702
- Come on. Just a minute.

23:25.905 --> 23:27.406
Look, I know
this is a fucked-up time

23:27.440 --> 23:29.776
to be bringing this up,
but, um...

23:29.809 --> 23:31.110
I'm short.

23:33.780 --> 23:34.981
I was hoping you could
float me something

23:35.014 --> 23:37.416
- just for a minute.

23:37.450 --> 23:38.618
Float you something?

23:39.752 --> 23:42.722
How many times I gotta tell you
that your money's my money?

23:42.755 --> 23:45.024
You borrowing my money
to pay me back with my money.

23:46.092 --> 23:47.727
What about
your recording studio?

23:47.760 --> 23:48.961
Supposed to be making
all that clean loot

23:48.995 --> 23:51.130
you been talkin' about,
legit cash.

23:51.164 --> 23:52.532
Just getting it started.

23:52.565 --> 23:54.433
Puttin' it up
on its feet is all.

23:54.467 --> 23:56.102
Even a ho can make money
on her knees, Lou.

23:56.135 --> 23:57.503
I'm not a ho, Raq.

23:57.537 --> 23:58.971
Then stop acting like one.

24:03.810 --> 24:05.812
Look, I got you,

24:05.845 --> 24:08.014
but from here on out,
your first name is On Point,

24:08.047 --> 24:09.715
and your last name is On Time

24:09.749 --> 24:12.752
in this business,
family business.

24:14.754 --> 24:16.589
Get your shit right, Lou.

24:21.894 --> 24:23.529
So your Uncle Vernon
still all swole

24:23.563 --> 24:25.832
off those three hots and a cot?

24:25.865 --> 24:28.668
Man, ain't nobody messin'
with that brother on the yard.

24:28.701 --> 24:30.636
But you got what you wanted.

24:32.138 --> 24:33.573
You wanted to talk
to your father's brother.

24:33.606 --> 24:34.740
You did.

24:37.710 --> 24:40.012
Ma, why did you want me
to kill that cop?

24:42.548 --> 24:44.717
You told me it was 'cause
he was crazy and all that,

24:44.750 --> 24:46.953
but that ain't enough,

24:46.986 --> 24:48.487
not to me.

24:49.922 --> 24:51.958
It's a lot of crazy police
out here.

24:51.991 --> 24:53.793
What's this gotta do
with Def Con?

24:53.826 --> 24:55.094
You put that gun in my hand

24:55.127 --> 24:57.063
and then told me
it was for family,

24:57.096 --> 24:58.731
to protect us.

24:58.764 --> 25:02.034
But what was he doing
that we needed protection for?

25:11.177 --> 25:13.112
Howard threatened to send you
up north for Buck Twenty.

25:13.145 --> 25:14.714
That don't--no.

25:14.747 --> 25:16.616
He didn't even have proof
of that.

25:16.649 --> 25:19.085
- And D-Wiz?
- He a cop, Kanan.

25:19.118 --> 25:21.053
They can make up
whatever the fuck they want.

25:21.087 --> 25:22.588
You think them young boys
in Central Park

25:22.622 --> 25:24.156
did all of that
to that white lady?

25:24.190 --> 25:26.158
If the police said they did it,
then they did it.

25:26.192 --> 25:27.593
That's how it works.

25:27.627 --> 25:29.595
That's the game
that they playing.

25:29.629 --> 25:31.197
Howard decided
that the best way to get to me

25:31.230 --> 25:34.300
was to get to you,
and he was right,

25:34.533 --> 25:36.168
'cause you all I care about.

25:36.202 --> 25:38.804
Look, the truth is,

25:38.838 --> 25:40.306
if it had been me
or one of your uncles

25:40.539 --> 25:41.707
or one of our people,

25:41.741 --> 25:42.942
that motherfucker
would have put us down

25:42.975 --> 25:45.244
before we got
within 100 yards of him.

25:45.278 --> 25:47.179
He was on one, Kanan,

25:47.213 --> 25:48.948
and he was gonna
threaten you that night.

25:48.981 --> 25:50.283
Either you snitch on me,

25:50.316 --> 25:52.585
or he was gonna lock you up
for Buck Twenty.

25:55.121 --> 25:57.189
That was the toughest decision
of my life.

25:59.625 --> 26:01.694
And like I said before,
I hate...

26:03.262 --> 26:04.630
...that I hurt you.

26:09.735 --> 26:10.870
I love you.

26:16.242 --> 26:18.077
Come on.

26:18.110 --> 26:19.612
Let's go home.

27:41.394 --> 27:42.361
You back.

27:50.436 --> 27:54.206
The room looks good... right?

27:54.240 --> 27:58.244
I mean, uh, the color
just f-felt like you.

28:01.147 --> 28:03.349
I found some shit to hang
I thought you'd like.

28:46.425 --> 28:47.893
So you're the little broad

28:47.927 --> 28:50.029
creating
all these big problems, huh?

28:51.097 --> 28:52.231
<i>You know, when I heard it,
I said,</i>

28:52.264 --> 28:54.100
<i>"She gotta be
from out of town,"</i>

28:54.133 --> 28:56.502
because nobody from Jersey
would ever dream

28:56.735 --> 28:58.437
of moving their shit
in my backyard

28:58.471 --> 29:00.906
without giving me my taste,

29:00.940 --> 29:02.308
'cause that's
grand fucking larceny

29:02.341 --> 29:05.444
of the highest fuckin' order,
my dusky friend.

29:05.478 --> 29:07.780
As far as I'm concerned,
I'd be within my rights

29:07.813 --> 29:09.949
to drop the lot of you
right where you stand.

29:09.982 --> 29:13.085
There's been a
misunderstanding, Mr. Boselli.

29:13.119 --> 29:15.154
- We're sorry if we stepped on--
- We ain't sorry for shit.

29:15.187 --> 29:17.223
I ain't see you posted up
in them projects.

29:17.256 --> 29:18.791
Didn't hear no claim
on that block.

29:18.824 --> 29:22.061
Just because I'm not there
doesn't mean I'm not there.

29:23.028 --> 29:25.297
That's the beauty of me.
I'm everywhere.

29:30.870 --> 29:33.539
Nothing happens in Newark
without my stamp of approval.

29:33.772 --> 29:35.808
So you just waitin'
for somebody to move in

29:35.841 --> 29:37.143
so you can squeeze 'em?

29:39.178 --> 29:41.313
That number right there
is the cost of doing business

29:41.347 --> 29:42.948
in my neck of the woods.

29:42.982 --> 29:44.483
You coming over that bridge
or through that tunnel,

29:44.517 --> 29:45.918
you gotta pay the toll.

29:47.853 --> 29:50.456
Consider that offer
to be best and final.

29:51.390 --> 29:52.558
Considered.

29:54.994 --> 29:56.428
And rejected.

30:06.138 --> 30:08.007
Oh, sh...

30:11.076 --> 30:13.212
I don't know. I kinda like her.

30:22.288 --> 30:23.822
Don't ever speak for me again.

30:24.557 --> 30:25.891
And who told you
to talk about a business

30:25.925 --> 30:27.159
that you barely even in?

30:27.193 --> 30:29.595
When they come for us,
they gonna come for all us.

30:29.828 --> 30:32.097
And if that's not bad enough,
you questioning me now.

30:32.131 --> 30:33.365
You apologizing
to that noodle nigga,

30:33.399 --> 30:34.934
but you gonna question me.

30:34.967 --> 30:37.069
<i>I'm just trying
to keep us all alive.</i>

30:37.102 --> 30:39.038
Taking out 'Nique,
that's one thing.

30:39.071 --> 30:42.174
These Mafia motherfuckers,
that's somethin' else.

30:44.043 --> 30:45.611
Lou shook, Marvin.
How about you?

30:45.844 --> 30:47.112
I ain't scared of nobody.

30:49.248 --> 30:50.616
Look, no more trucks.

30:50.849 --> 30:52.618
From here on out,
we takin' the short bus.

30:54.086 --> 30:55.888
This here is a team sport, Lou.

30:55.921 --> 30:57.223
You wanna do that solo shit,

30:57.256 --> 30:58.624
you need to take up
some tennis, nigga.

31:03.562 --> 31:05.864
Now, you know this shit
is fucked up, just like I do,

31:05.898 --> 31:08.167
but you too much of a bitch
to say it to her.

31:08.200 --> 31:10.035
Nigga, all that music
you listen to

31:10.069 --> 31:12.404
got you deaf and dumb.

31:29.088 --> 31:30.456
Yeah!

31:37.162 --> 31:39.465
You gettin' your ass whupped.

31:43.669 --> 31:45.271
Yo. Yo!

31:45.304 --> 31:47.973
Everybody, listen up.
Listen up.

31:48.007 --> 31:50.075
Shh!

31:50.109 --> 31:52.611
Everybody,
give it up to my man,

31:52.645 --> 31:56.181
my brother,
Kanan motherfucking Stark

31:56.215 --> 31:58.083
in the fucking building,

31:58.117 --> 32:00.519
for payin' for everything
and puttin' this shit together.

32:00.552 --> 32:02.621
Give it up!
Give it up to my man Kanan.

32:02.655 --> 32:04.690
- Yeah.

32:04.923 --> 32:06.425
Welcome to Club Famous, niggas.

32:06.458 --> 32:08.227
- Oh!
- Whoa!

32:08.260 --> 32:09.695
I'm good!

32:09.928 --> 32:11.430
- Yeah!

32:29.481 --> 32:31.517
Uh, you may wanna keep it down.

32:31.550 --> 32:33.986
Ms. Davis in 406
will call the cops on you.

32:34.019 --> 32:36.722
Uh, who are you?

32:38.123 --> 32:39.258
Corinne.

32:43.362 --> 32:45.564
You and, uh,

32:45.597 --> 32:47.966
your sister wanna come inside,
Corrine?

32:49.268 --> 32:52.071
I'm Corinne's mother,

32:52.104 --> 32:54.239
Palomar.

32:56.308 --> 32:57.476
For real?

32:58.410 --> 33:00.679
We're your neighbors in 402.

33:03.048 --> 33:04.249
Hey, Mom, you care

33:04.283 --> 33:06.352
if I kick it here
for a minute with...

33:06.385 --> 33:07.986
Kanan.

33:08.020 --> 33:10.022
...Kanan?

33:15.694 --> 33:17.696
For a little while.

33:17.730 --> 33:19.498
Not too long.

33:19.531 --> 33:23.335
I wouldn't want Kanan to get
the wrong idea about you.

33:32.745 --> 33:34.279
Nice meeting you, Kanan.

33:35.481 --> 33:37.015
You too.

34:02.474 --> 34:04.610
Hey, it happens to everybody.

34:05.411 --> 34:07.246
For real.

34:07.279 --> 34:09.715
You been through
a hell of a lot.

34:09.748 --> 34:13.185
You know, I always say
that your dick knows more

34:13.218 --> 34:14.720
about your head
than your brain.

34:14.753 --> 34:16.789
- That's what you always say?
- Mm-hmm.

34:18.090 --> 34:20.325
We got a ho philosopher
over here, huh?

34:22.060 --> 34:25.230
Believe it or not, I actually
know some shit, Malcolm.

34:25.264 --> 34:27.299
And I actually know
some shit about men.

34:33.138 --> 34:34.473
Andrea...

34:37.509 --> 34:38.710
...I got a son, you know?

34:40.446 --> 34:42.347
About the same age as your kid.

34:44.783 --> 34:47.820
We been doing this thing for,

34:47.853 --> 34:50.155
what, seven years,

34:50.189 --> 34:52.491
and you have never
mentioned a kid,

34:52.524 --> 34:54.426
not even once.

34:54.460 --> 34:59.431
And ain't no photos of any kid
anywhere in your house,

34:59.465 --> 35:00.566
ever.

35:01.767 --> 35:03.635
I just found out.

35:03.669 --> 35:05.204
Oh.

35:05.237 --> 35:07.806
I don't even know
what to say to him.

35:07.840 --> 35:10.609
I told him I'd die for him,
like you said before.

35:11.844 --> 35:13.412
That shit
ain't move the needle.

35:14.346 --> 35:17.349
That's some heavy shit
to say to a kid...

35:17.382 --> 35:20.619
...especially one
that you just discovered

35:20.652 --> 35:22.321
is your child.

35:23.689 --> 35:24.723
Hmm?

35:26.692 --> 35:28.393
He don't even think
I'm his father.

35:28.427 --> 35:30.362
Because you're not.

35:32.531 --> 35:35.868
Being someone's daddy
ain't just saying it, Malcolm.

35:35.901 --> 35:39.471
You gotta show up for your kid,

35:39.505 --> 35:41.306
be there for him,

35:41.340 --> 35:43.842
let him know
that he can count on you.

35:43.876 --> 35:48.447
I mean, kids can feel
who's in their corner,

35:48.480 --> 35:49.848
hmm?

35:49.882 --> 35:52.584
Be in your son's corner, Malcolm,

35:52.618 --> 35:55.687
and then he'll know
you're his daddy.

36:09.334 --> 36:12.170
Hey, baby.
You seen your cousin?

36:13.238 --> 36:15.674
Famous is havin' some people
over at the new place.

36:15.707 --> 36:17.876
Oh, Famous got
his own apartment now?

36:17.910 --> 36:20.546
Some place down by Rochdale.

36:20.579 --> 36:22.281
Where he get the money
to pay for that?

36:22.314 --> 36:26.652
Crown has a connect
who owns the building.

36:26.685 --> 36:28.921
Crown in business
with everybody.

36:28.954 --> 36:30.422
<i>I'ma go down there
later tonight.</i>

36:30.455 --> 36:32.457
If I see Kanan, you want me
to tell him anything?

36:32.491 --> 36:34.960
Oh, no, I was just wonderin'
where he was.

36:36.595 --> 36:38.230
I saw my mom today.

36:49.441 --> 36:50.576
You saw your mother?

36:52.344 --> 36:53.312
Where?

36:53.345 --> 36:55.781
She's been living uptown.

36:55.814 --> 36:58.417
It was crazy.

36:58.450 --> 37:00.652
I mean... weird.

37:01.954 --> 37:04.389
<i>Sitting across from her
after all those years.</i>

37:06.258 --> 37:07.659
She reach out to you?

37:07.693 --> 37:10.529
Nah. I tracked her down.

37:10.562 --> 37:12.698
She's been living in New York
for a minute.

37:13.865 --> 37:15.567
But she never thought
to come find you.

37:21.340 --> 37:22.608
Just 'cause you blood
with somebody

37:22.641 --> 37:24.276
don't mean they deserve
to be in your life.

37:25.777 --> 37:27.446
Family's earned, Juke.

37:27.479 --> 37:28.914
<i>It ain't just a given.</i>

37:32.451 --> 37:34.786
All right. You hungry?

37:34.820 --> 37:35.954
I'll fix you something to eat.

37:35.988 --> 37:37.389
No, thank you.

37:39.024 --> 37:40.325
All right.

37:46.965 --> 37:48.400
<i>Count's light.</i>

37:48.433 --> 37:51.003
- You short 600.
-  I know.

37:51.036 --> 37:54.306
Thing is, I stacked that shit
myself back at Baisley.

37:54.339 --> 37:56.575
Put it in the box
in the closet.

37:56.608 --> 37:58.543
I don't know what the fuck
happened to it.

37:58.577 --> 38:00.345
Fuck it doing in the closet?

38:00.379 --> 38:02.280
Shit's supposed to move
as soon as we get it.

38:02.314 --> 38:03.415
Been keeping some extra around,

38:03.448 --> 38:04.950
just in case
we need it during the day.

38:04.983 --> 38:06.918
Who the fuck told you
to do that?

38:06.952 --> 38:08.587
That's how 'Nique--

38:11.289 --> 38:12.324
'Nique?

38:13.358 --> 38:16.595
Yo, the nigga here?

38:17.829 --> 38:19.965
He-he-he in the closet?

38:21.900 --> 38:25.404
Or-or maybe he under
the-the mattress or some shit?

38:25.437 --> 38:28.640
Because I don't see him
nowhere, Worrell.

38:28.674 --> 38:31.877
But 'Nique sneaky,
so ma-maybe he here.

38:33.945 --> 38:35.080
In here?

38:40.018 --> 38:43.722
You work for us, nigga.

38:43.755 --> 38:45.524
You do it our way.

38:45.557 --> 38:48.627
The money moves always.

38:52.898 --> 38:54.332
You tell Lou?

38:54.366 --> 38:56.868
Lou don't never
come round here.

38:56.902 --> 38:59.004
That's why I hit you up.

38:59.871 --> 39:02.507
Someone's skimmin'...

39:02.541 --> 39:04.776
and when you catch the nigga,

39:04.810 --> 39:06.578
we gonna have to do what we do.

39:14.419 --> 39:16.021
I need you to do a run.

39:17.522 --> 39:19.591
Know how to fuck
with a stick shift?

39:41.847 --> 39:44.816
It's my backup singer, y'all.

39:44.850 --> 39:47.419
You call me that one more time,
I'ma fuck you up.

39:47.452 --> 39:48.620
You know I love you, Juke.

39:48.653 --> 39:50.956
Shit. All right.

39:50.989 --> 39:53.058
Check it out!

39:53.091 --> 39:54.760
- Right? Right?
- Nice!

39:54.793 --> 39:55.927
- All right.
- Let me make you a drink.

40:05.036 --> 40:06.671
You got a girlfriend?

40:07.873 --> 40:09.007
Dolo.

40:09.975 --> 40:11.510
Not anymore, you're not.

40:17.449 --> 40:20.118
Check it out. This new shit.

40:20.152 --> 40:23.421
I'm on my own now, Juke.
I got my own crib.

40:23.455 --> 40:25.190
- Yeah?
- I'm writing rhymes again.

40:25.423 --> 40:27.459
'Bout to be back on top, nigga. Moves.

40:31.797 --> 40:34.900
Crown Camacho in this bitch!
Yo, what's good?

40:34.933 --> 40:36.034
Yo.

40:40.705 --> 40:42.140
Hey!

40:42.174 --> 40:44.843
- Oh, you got guests.
- Yes, sir.

40:46.178 --> 40:47.979
I like. I like.

40:48.013 --> 40:49.481
- Yeah.

40:49.514 --> 40:51.016
Yo, let me take care of you
like you take care of me.

40:51.049 --> 40:52.484
A'ight, make you a drink.

40:54.085 --> 40:55.053
Yo, Kanan.

40:55.086 --> 40:56.521
Juke.

40:57.923 --> 40:59.124
I was hoping I'd see you here.

40:59.157 --> 41:01.092
Why would you be hoping
to talk to me?

41:01.126 --> 41:03.595
'Cause I got this track
that you'll love, girl.

41:03.628 --> 41:04.963
Believe that.

41:32.924 --> 41:36.928
So... it's to your
new mixing board

41:36.962 --> 41:39.064
and all them hits
you gonna make on it.

41:39.097 --> 41:42.133
Ain't shit Cartier Fareed
can't get his hands on, huh?

41:42.167 --> 41:45.971
If you can fulfill a need,
you'll always be necessary.

41:48.273 --> 41:50.842
And that's what you doing,
my brother.

41:50.876 --> 41:53.678
Heads need that sound
that speaks to them,

41:53.712 --> 41:55.814
that feels like 'em,
that moves like 'em.

41:55.847 --> 41:58.083
That's what
I'm trying to do here.

41:58.116 --> 41:59.517
I don't know,
feel like everybody

41:59.551 --> 42:00.652
keep gettin' in my way.

42:02.754 --> 42:04.289
You ever heard of Lee Iacocca?

42:05.790 --> 42:07.525
- The car nigga?
- Mm.

42:07.559 --> 42:11.096
President, CEO,
and chairman of Chrysler.

42:11.129 --> 42:12.597
Now, that man's
a business savant.

42:12.631 --> 42:14.532
He knows everything
from marketing

42:14.566 --> 42:16.735
to supply chain management.

42:16.768 --> 42:18.937
But Lee has a saying.

42:18.970 --> 42:22.574
The speed of the boss
is the speed of the team.

42:23.575 --> 42:26.311
So... if you gonna be the boss,

42:26.544 --> 42:29.014
you gotta set the pace,
my nigga.

42:30.982 --> 42:32.617
Word up.

42:32.651 --> 42:33.952
Get some more of this.

42:33.985 --> 42:35.887
You like the good shit.

42:35.921 --> 42:37.656
- Yeah.

42:59.110 --> 43:00.345
He came to my store.

43:01.646 --> 43:03.315
Unique.

43:03.348 --> 43:05.116
He comes and he goes
as he pleases.

43:05.150 --> 43:07.852
After everything
that he did to me,

43:07.886 --> 43:09.621
to you.

43:09.654 --> 43:11.656
<i>I thought you were strong.</i>

43:11.690 --> 43:13.258
This is weakness.

43:14.359 --> 43:15.727
He laughs at us.

43:15.760 --> 43:18.129
It's all strategy, Juliana.

43:18.163 --> 43:19.764
Now, it might not
feel right to you,

43:19.798 --> 43:22.834
but it's just a move
in this game we playing.

43:24.102 --> 43:25.937
I'm not playing your game.

43:47.025 --> 43:48.960
- Yo.
- Yeah?

43:48.994 --> 43:50.762
What you doing with all them
church clothes?

43:50.795 --> 43:53.999
I'm goin' on Sunday.

43:55.066 --> 43:57.335
What, Juke catching the
Holy Ghost all of a sudden?

43:59.637 --> 44:02.807
I'm asking God
to save me from Famous.

44:02.841 --> 44:03.975
Tsh.

44:04.009 --> 44:06.211
Fool was pushin' up on me
at his party.

44:06.244 --> 44:08.146
Come on, that dude
always pushin' up on you.

44:10.015 --> 44:12.083
Nigga got a little closer
than usual.

44:14.853 --> 44:17.989
Yeah, Fame wasn't feelin'
no type of pain last night.

44:18.023 --> 44:20.925
- Neither was you.

44:20.959 --> 44:22.861
-  Hey.

44:25.230 --> 44:28.033
I actually...
grabbed up all these clothes

44:28.066 --> 44:30.335
'cause my moms asked me
to go to her church with her.

44:30.368 --> 44:33.938
Oh, shit. Your mother.

44:33.972 --> 44:37.375
Damn, I forgot, Juke,
but how did that go?

44:41.813 --> 44:44.082
I don't know, man.

44:44.115 --> 44:45.316
She's...

44:47.318 --> 44:48.953
...a'ight.

44:48.987 --> 44:52.357
Can't call it. Still too soon.

44:52.390 --> 44:55.160
I mean, she left
when I was a damn baby.

44:55.193 --> 44:56.428
What kind of mother does that?

44:58.463 --> 45:01.366
One who got Marvin
as the father.

45:02.734 --> 45:04.869
You wanna know
what was really a trip?

45:06.738 --> 45:08.173
Her eyes, man.

45:10.742 --> 45:13.945
Lookin' in 'em.

45:16.981 --> 45:19.250
There was something
that I recognized.

45:20.285 --> 45:23.088
<i>Like I've always known her</i>

45:23.121 --> 45:25.223
<i>and she's always known me.</i>

45:28.059 --> 45:31.296
It was like lookin' at myself
in some fucked-up way.

45:34.232 --> 45:35.733
That's deep.

45:38.169 --> 45:39.904
For real.

45:47.278 --> 45:48.880
Well, I'll leave you two alone.

45:48.913 --> 45:50.081
Give you some time.

45:54.986 --> 45:56.421
So this is where

45:56.454 --> 45:58.223
all the family dinners
are gonna go down.

45:59.791 --> 46:02.093
Thinking about putting the
dining room table right here,

46:02.127 --> 46:04.195
and then I'ma put a big
old chandelier above it.

46:05.763 --> 46:06.898
Thinking about
maybe ripping out

46:06.931 --> 46:08.133
these hardwood floors too,

46:08.166 --> 46:09.400
puttin' in some carpet.

46:10.401 --> 46:11.469
What you think?

46:13.338 --> 46:15.773
Why'd you reach out to me, Raq?

46:15.807 --> 46:17.842
I mean, I know you do all that
urban planning and shit.

46:17.876 --> 46:19.177
Figure you know
about architecture

46:19.210 --> 46:20.411
and buildings and all that.

46:20.445 --> 46:22.180
And the hardwood floors.

46:22.213 --> 46:23.882
Yeah. The hardwood floors.

46:29.087 --> 46:31.156
You can go if you want to.

46:35.093 --> 46:36.895
What do you want from me, Raq?

46:38.196 --> 46:39.931
I want you to tell me
if I should

46:39.964 --> 46:42.167
rip up these hardwood floors
and put some carpet in.

46:45.236 --> 46:47.305
Just lay the carpet
over the hardwood.

46:47.338 --> 46:50.141
Hardwood
never goes out of style.

46:50.175 --> 46:51.509
You might want it back sometime.

46:53.845 --> 46:57.015
Yeah, the rug's not gonna be
too high, right?

46:57.048 --> 46:59.083
'Cause you know I like my
carpets like I like my men...

47:01.286 --> 47:02.287
...thick.

47:05.256 --> 47:07.158
You a clown.

47:10.895 --> 47:12.897
- You know that?
- Mm-hmm.

47:15.567 --> 47:18.469
Come on.
I'll show you the bedrooms.

47:20.405 --> 47:22.106
Hey.

47:34.018 --> 47:35.220
I need to know.

47:36.454 --> 47:40.024
I thought I didn't, but...
I do.

47:42.860 --> 47:45.096
What happened that night,

47:45.129 --> 47:48.166
the night you had me
take Kanan out of state?

47:49.234 --> 47:50.468
Cops was wilin'.

47:52.003 --> 47:53.404
I needed my boy gone.

47:56.174 --> 47:58.343
What happened that night is,
I was protecting my son.

48:00.278 --> 48:01.479
Protecting Kanan?

48:01.512 --> 48:02.647
Always.

48:06.584 --> 48:07.552
Right.

48:11.222 --> 48:12.991
Let me show you those bedrooms.

48:31.309 --> 48:33.945
Yup. Gonna be on a bus.

48:33.978 --> 48:36.414
One of them short joints
leaving from the Southside.

48:36.447 --> 48:37.982
Check it out, man.

48:38.016 --> 48:39.617
Don't fuck with my mans,
a'ight?

48:39.651 --> 48:40.652
He with me.

48:44.689 --> 48:45.957
Gotta go.

48:48.259 --> 48:50.528
You openin' up again in here?

48:50.561 --> 48:52.664
Never closed, Detective.

48:52.697 --> 48:54.532
Can I help you, uh,
find something?

48:55.400 --> 48:56.968
<i>You know,
we got a lot of new, uh,</i>

48:57.001 --> 49:00.104
fabrics being shipped in
from Paris next week.

49:00.138 --> 49:01.606
Maybe something nice
to bring out the color

49:01.639 --> 49:03.408
in those pretty
little eyes of yours.

49:03.441 --> 49:04.676
I'm good.

49:04.709 --> 49:06.344
<i>Know what they say.</i>

49:06.377 --> 49:09.280
Clothes make the man...
or the woman.

49:09.314 --> 49:10.415
Is that what they say?

49:12.283 --> 49:14.185
Seems like you hit
a rough patch.

49:15.119 --> 49:18.056
My partner gets shot,
almost dies.

49:19.057 --> 49:21.326
You get locked up for it,
even though you didn't do it.

49:24.062 --> 49:26.531
You lose your business
and everything else.

49:28.032 --> 49:31.135
Meanwhile,
word is that you got set up.

49:33.071 --> 49:35.673
That you got played, Unique.

49:35.707 --> 49:37.442
Someone fucked me over
like that...

49:37.475 --> 49:40.144
...I'd be pissed.

49:41.012 --> 49:43.014
Wanna know who it was
so I could get payback.

49:43.047 --> 49:44.449
I guess that's the difference

49:44.482 --> 49:47.051
between you and I, Detective.

49:47.085 --> 49:49.454
You see, I'm all about
that live-and-let-live shit.

49:49.487 --> 49:52.023
God, grant me the tranquility

49:52.056 --> 49:54.692
to know what the fuck
I can change,

49:54.726 --> 49:56.994
what the fuck I can't change,

49:57.028 --> 49:59.731
and the wisdom to know
the goddamn difference.

49:59.764 --> 50:02.233
-"Serenity."
- Scuse me?

50:02.266 --> 50:04.102
"God, grant me
the serenity to know."

50:04.135 --> 50:07.238
Same shit.

50:07.271 --> 50:08.773
We done here,
or can I offer you

50:09.006 --> 50:11.142
a nice linen pantsuit
or something?

50:11.175 --> 50:13.378
You know,
it's lovely on a hot day.

50:13.411 --> 50:16.247
And we can even cut it
to accentuate...

50:16.280 --> 50:18.783
whatever it is
that you're offering,

50:19.016 --> 50:21.552
'cause I know you're offering
something, Detective.

50:24.088 --> 50:26.023
I got my eye on you.

50:27.692 --> 50:29.660
And I've got mines on you.

50:35.066 --> 50:37.135
Good day, Detective.

50:41.739 --> 50:44.108
You just make the offer.
I'll handle everything else.

50:45.576 --> 50:46.811
Done.

50:56.087 --> 50:57.422
So I'm doing this.

50:58.823 --> 51:00.358
I'm happy for you.

51:05.062 --> 51:06.731
You don't seem happy for me.

51:10.735 --> 51:12.804
I need you to stop calling me.

51:12.837 --> 51:14.572
Stop pulling me back to you.

51:16.541 --> 51:18.609
I need you
to just leave me alone.

51:20.511 --> 51:23.314
We're gonna do the same shit
all over again,

51:23.347 --> 51:25.116
end up in the same place...

51:27.351 --> 51:29.187
...or maybe someplace worse.

51:33.658 --> 51:35.092
All I'm saying is...

51:36.461 --> 51:38.729
...if you do care about me,
and I believe you do,

51:38.763 --> 51:40.231
I really do...

51:42.433 --> 51:43.601
...let me go.

51:45.336 --> 51:47.772
Let me move on with my life.

51:53.478 --> 51:55.713
You're a grown man.

51:55.746 --> 51:57.748
Can't make you do nothin'
you don't wanna do.

52:06.457 --> 52:10.428
You once told me
I was like a vacation for you.

52:10.461 --> 52:11.596
Remember that?

52:14.899 --> 52:17.435
But I never wanted
to be your vacation, Raq.

52:19.704 --> 52:21.706
I wanted to be your home.

53:00.344 --> 53:01.846
Call me
soon as drop's done.

53:26.203 --> 53:27.772
Where you going?

53:27.805 --> 53:28.906
Hanging out with Famous.

53:29.774 --> 53:30.808
Be safe.

53:30.841 --> 53:32.810
Always.

54:05.610 --> 54:07.845
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

54:07.878 --> 54:09.013
<i>All right, all right.</i>

54:09.246 --> 54:11.449
<i>Here come the drums.</i>

54:11.482 --> 54:13.351
<i>All right, all right.</i>

54:13.384 --> 54:15.419
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

54:15.453 --> 54:16.754
<i>Yeah, yeah!</i>

54:16.787 --> 54:18.889
<i>All right, all right.</i>

54:40.711 --> 54:41.912
Time to get the fuck out!

55:01.499 --> 55:03.334
Yo. Slow down. Calm down.

55:03.367 --> 55:05.069
Let me fucking hear you.

55:11.742 --> 55:13.477
You gotta be
fuckin' kiddin' me.

55:15.546 --> 55:16.847
The fuckin' bus too?

55:23.854 --> 55:25.790
Motherfucker.

55:42.807 --> 55:45.342
<i>Everybody got their own shit,</i>

55:45.376 --> 55:48.012
<i>their own journey,
their own path.</i>

55:52.083 --> 55:53.551
<i>Some motherfuckers
living in the present,</i>

55:53.584 --> 55:55.453
<i>tryin' to figure out
who they are.</i>

56:07.031 --> 56:10.701
<i>And then some motherfuckers
are lookin' toward the future,</i>

56:10.735 --> 56:13.838
<i>tryin' to figure out
who they wanna be.</i>

56:26.951 --> 56:29.620
<i>And then there are other heads
stuck in the past,</i>

56:29.653 --> 56:31.555
<i>doing everything
in their power to make sure</i>

56:31.589 --> 56:33.591
<i>that none of us find out
who they were.</i>

56:35.025 --> 56:36.093
<i>And that's what
all this shit is.</i>

56:37.628 --> 56:38.896
<i>That's what life is.</i>

56:39.797 --> 56:41.932
<i>A fucking throwdown
between what happened,</i>

56:41.966 --> 56:44.001
<i>what's happening,
and what's gonna happen.</i>

56:46.704 --> 56:48.405
<i>And I know
what you're wonderin'.</i>

56:49.540 --> 56:52.143
<i>Who's gonna win
this fucking fight,</i>

56:52.176 --> 56:54.945
<i>the past, the present,
or the future?</i>

56:56.981 --> 56:58.749
<i>Shit.</i>

56:58.783 --> 57:01.185
<i>Why you asking me, nigga?</i>
