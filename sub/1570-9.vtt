00:41.215 --> 00:43.650
Oh, my God, for my birthday!

00:43.684 --> 00:45.084
What a surprise!

00:45.119 --> 00:46.319
You guys!

00:46.354 --> 00:47.920
I almost had a heart attack!

00:50.891 --> 00:52.791
Okay, I got my birthday
all planned out.

00:52.825 --> 00:55.361
I want us all to drink
a bunch of Four Lokos,

00:55.395 --> 00:57.095
then swim across the lake
after midnight.

00:57.130 --> 00:58.897
I really don't think
it's that far across.

00:58.931 --> 00:59.998
It looks real close.

01:00.032 --> 01:01.512
Roger, didn't you
just have a birthday

01:01.534 --> 01:02.668
a couple of months ago?

01:02.702 --> 01:04.602
Yeah, that's right.

01:04.638 --> 01:07.005
You made us ride ATVs
on Ted Nugent's ranch

01:07.039 --> 01:08.539
without his permission.

01:08.574 --> 01:10.775
Fine, you caught me.
It's not my birthday.

01:10.809 --> 01:12.943
But that's the only day
of the year

01:12.978 --> 01:15.546
I can get you nervous Nellies
to do anything adventurous.

01:15.581 --> 01:17.649
So, who's in
for the Loko lake swim?

01:17.683 --> 01:19.917
Look, Roger, we're all
for trying new things,

01:19.951 --> 01:21.286
but that sounds too dangerous.

01:21.320 --> 01:22.887
Yeah, if new things
are so great,

01:22.921 --> 01:24.888
where have they been
all this time?

01:24.922 --> 01:28.558
Well, well, well,
what have we here?

01:28.593 --> 01:32.028
Discount coupons
to the American Safety Museum?!

01:32.062 --> 01:33.797
Using these!

01:33.831 --> 01:37.133
Oh, look, they're doing an
exhibit on Augustus Seatbelt,

01:37.168 --> 01:39.670
the inventor of the airbag.

01:39.704 --> 01:41.304
Hello?!

01:41.338 --> 01:44.173
We're not going
to any stupid safety museum.

01:44.207 --> 01:46.609
Why doesn't anyone
ever listen to me?

01:47.644 --> 01:49.945
You guys will not believe
what's in this towel.

01:49.979 --> 01:51.747
A baby! A baby
you gave birth to

01:51.782 --> 01:53.416
and you didn't even know
you were pregnant!

01:53.450 --> 01:54.983
It just popped out on the lawn.

01:55.018 --> 01:57.452
You thought you were just
taking a "D" on the lawn,

01:57.486 --> 01:58.787
but surprise,
it wasn't a deuce,

01:58.821 --> 02:00.988
it was a baby
and it's in that towel!

02:01.023 --> 02:02.524
Show me that baby!

02:02.558 --> 02:05.259
No, it's a raccoon.

02:05.294 --> 02:07.061
What did you do
with your baby?!

02:07.095 --> 02:08.729
Look at this adorable guy!

02:08.764 --> 02:10.398
I'm gonna call him Cuddles...

02:10.433 --> 02:12.899
after the cat he was eating
when I found him.

02:12.934 --> 02:15.068
Oh, my God, you won't do
my dangerous birthday plan,

02:15.102 --> 02:16.737
but you're gonna let her keep

02:16.771 --> 02:18.238
a wild animal in the house?

02:18.272 --> 02:20.173
She got a pet.
I think it's nice.

02:20.208 --> 02:21.475
Uch, forget this.

02:21.509 --> 02:24.177
I'm gonna go do something
on the edge like skydiving,

02:24.212 --> 02:26.413
or trying on underwear
at Marshall's.

02:27.682 --> 02:29.248
Oh, hey, Roger, there you are.

02:29.282 --> 02:30.950
I wanted to ask your advice.

02:30.984 --> 02:33.686
Finally! Someone who wants
to hear what I have to say.

02:33.721 --> 02:35.855
So I have a crush on this girl,

02:35.889 --> 02:37.323
but she only goes for jocks.

02:37.358 --> 02:39.291
Well, she sounds
too smart for you, Steve.

02:39.326 --> 02:40.760
I suggest
you find somebody else,

02:40.794 --> 02:42.294
'cause you'll never be a jock.

02:42.329 --> 02:44.730
That's it!
I'll become a jock!

02:44.764 --> 02:47.265
You'll be as good a jock
as you are a listener.

02:49.802 --> 02:52.871
They should've listened to me.
That was an epic swim.

02:52.905 --> 02:54.506
I think my favorite part
was when

02:54.540 --> 02:56.708
that guy drowned trying
to save me.

02:56.743 --> 02:58.610
Now, if only there was a way

02:58.644 --> 03:00.044
I could remember this day
forever.

03:00.079 --> 03:02.312
Oh, my God, a red-light camera!

03:09.521 --> 03:11.522
Now if this light would
just turn red,

03:11.556 --> 03:13.357
we'd have one hell
of a picture.

03:13.392 --> 03:14.492
Hey, come on!

03:14.526 --> 03:15.726
What are you waiting for?

03:15.761 --> 03:17.326
Blow it out your ass!

03:19.000 --> 03:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:40.450 --> 03:42.584
Roger, thank God you're awake!

03:42.619 --> 03:43.852
You've been in a coma.

03:43.887 --> 03:46.555
Oh, my God, how long was I out?

03:46.589 --> 03:48.024
This long?
Or this long?

03:48.058 --> 03:49.524
The first one.

03:49.558 --> 03:51.826
Roger, I just want to tell you
how happy we are

03:51.860 --> 03:53.929
that we didn't go along
with your stupid plan.

03:53.963 --> 03:56.798
Yes, if you weren't so easy
to dismiss,

03:56.832 --> 03:58.533
we could be in here with you.

03:58.567 --> 04:00.868
Mom, Dad, thank you
for not listening to Roger.

04:00.903 --> 04:03.038
Well, this has been
a grand reunion.

04:03.072 --> 04:04.072
Roger, you're awake,

04:04.106 --> 04:05.906
which means you're
probably alive.

04:05.941 --> 04:07.774
Let's check your vitals.

04:13.881 --> 04:17.250
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye!

04:17.285 --> 04:18.485
A body...

04:18.519 --> 04:19.619
a lawsuit...

04:19.654 --> 04:21.821
Doctor, I just had a vision.

04:21.855 --> 04:23.156
You're being fired by a baby.

04:23.190 --> 04:26.525
Well, that's impossible,
unless it was Dr. Baby,

04:26.560 --> 04:29.028
the baby who's in charge
of this hospital.

04:29.063 --> 04:31.797
But I assure you,
your vision wasn't real.

04:31.832 --> 04:34.300
It was nothing but
a postcomatic delusion.

04:34.335 --> 04:36.369
You just need
a little more rest.

04:36.403 --> 04:39.304
I think your family should
probably leave.

04:39.339 --> 04:41.539
I'm sorry, what?
I thought you guys should go.

04:41.574 --> 04:42.740
Yeah, so did we.

04:42.775 --> 04:45.810
I swear, what I saw
seemed so real.

04:45.845 --> 04:47.379
I think you're
gonna lose your job.

04:47.413 --> 04:49.247
There's
nothing to worry about.

04:49.282 --> 04:52.017
I'm a dedicated professional
with a spotless record...

04:52.051 --> 04:54.185
You see, when I'm engaged
with a patient,

04:54.219 --> 04:56.988
it's as if the whole world
disappears around me.

04:58.156 --> 05:01.125
Oh, no, the bad sound.

05:01.159 --> 05:02.293
He's dead!

05:02.327 --> 05:05.662
This was clearly
your fault, Doctor!

05:05.697 --> 05:07.764
Damn it!
It's gonna take more

05:07.799 --> 05:09.799
than a game of peekaboo
with Dr. Baby

05:09.833 --> 05:11.234
to get out of this one.

05:12.803 --> 05:15.038
Oh, my God, I was right!

05:15.072 --> 05:16.373
This was my vision!

05:16.407 --> 05:18.608
Ma'am? Ma'am, I was right.

05:19.910 --> 05:23.013
<i>I see you on a beach...</i>
<i>with a guy!</i>

05:23.047 --> 05:25.381
<i>I wouldn't dread</i>
<i>hanging out with him.</i>

05:25.415 --> 05:27.582
Your new boyfriend
has dreadlocks.

05:27.617 --> 05:28.783
How dare you?!

05:28.818 --> 05:31.520
I'll never love
anyone but my husband.

05:31.554 --> 05:33.455
I'm here to gather
the dead man, mon.

05:33.490 --> 05:36.892
Whoa, you look sexy
when you cry.

05:36.926 --> 05:40.795
Really? No one's ever noticed
that about me before.

05:40.830 --> 05:43.331
How about I buy you
a Red Stripe?

05:48.137 --> 05:51.272
And that's when I was sure
that I could see the future.

05:51.306 --> 05:53.587
Roger, the last time you thought
you could see the future,

05:53.608 --> 05:55.643
you said that Rodney would have
the best party.

05:55.677 --> 05:58.178
But his parents came home early
and ruined the whole thing.

05:59.280 --> 06:01.548
It's here!

06:04.419 --> 06:07.554
One Rowflex and five
containers of protein powder.

06:08.889 --> 06:11.991
Thanks to all this,
I'm about to become a jock!

06:21.900 --> 06:24.436
You're never gonna use
any of that stuff!

06:24.470 --> 06:26.271
Of course I'm gonna use it!

06:26.305 --> 06:28.773
And I'm starting with
a protein shake right now.

06:32.411 --> 06:33.445
Mom?

06:33.479 --> 06:35.113
All right, give it to me.

06:38.583 --> 06:41.718
I see a desperate man
with a clip-on tie...

06:41.752 --> 06:42.986
a set of keys...

06:43.020 --> 06:45.055
Francine, you're getting
a new car!

06:45.090 --> 06:47.057
That's ridiculous, Roger.

06:47.092 --> 06:49.493
I just got a new car
and I love it.

06:49.527 --> 06:52.161
It's the same car
that Matt Damon drove

06:52.196 --> 06:53.496
in <i>We Bought a Zoo.</i>

06:53.530 --> 06:57.266
I like to drive around and
pretend I have zoo problems.

06:57.301 --> 06:59.902
"Oh, my God, what am I
gonna do about my zoo?"

06:59.936 --> 07:00.970
Right?

07:01.004 --> 07:02.171
It's time!

07:02.206 --> 07:05.040
Everybody ready to go
to the American Safety Museum?

07:05.075 --> 07:07.843
Interesting. It says here
autoerotic asphyxiation

07:07.877 --> 07:10.245
is the number one
cause of awkward funerals.

07:10.279 --> 07:11.546
Ooh, they have a picture?

07:20.389 --> 07:22.724
Oh, my God, you can't go!

07:22.758 --> 07:24.391
Horrible things will happen!

07:24.426 --> 07:25.526
Roger, what could happen?

07:25.560 --> 07:27.094
It's the Safety Museum.

07:27.129 --> 07:29.530
Yeah, it's not like
it's the Natural History Museum,

07:29.564 --> 07:31.798
full of dangerous ideas
and attitudes.

07:31.833 --> 07:34.935
Ignore him, Stan.
We can take my car.

07:37.809 --> 07:40.773
You have to believe me!
You're making a huge mistake!

07:40.807 --> 07:41.949
Were you talking to me?

07:42.069 --> 07:43.715
'Cause I was only gonna try
it this once.

07:43.835 --> 07:45.407
I have a paper due
in the morning.

07:54.874 --> 07:58.506
You have been randomly
selected for racial profiling.

07:58.633 --> 08:00.767
Hoo-hoo-hoo,
this is so real!

08:00.802 --> 08:03.704
Stan, this museum
has some great exhibits.

08:03.738 --> 08:06.440
Yeah, let's go check out
the "Kobe Bryant Encounter."

08:06.474 --> 08:09.275
Do you want to come
up to my hotel room?

08:09.310 --> 08:10.409
Sure!

08:10.444 --> 08:12.378
I think we should move on.

08:12.412 --> 08:15.781
No, I know I can get this!

08:15.816 --> 08:18.517
Do you want to come
up to my hotel room?

08:18.552 --> 08:21.354
As long as you have a T-shirt
I can sleep in.

08:21.388 --> 08:23.021
Forget it. This is impossible.

08:25.425 --> 08:27.792
Is this an exhibit,
or is this just a wet floor?

08:27.827 --> 08:29.427
I don't know.
I just started.

08:29.462 --> 08:31.363
The last tour guide
got fired yesterday.

08:31.397 --> 08:33.130
She was <i>not</i> happy.

08:33.164 --> 08:35.066
Hey, there she is. Hi, Helen!

08:35.100 --> 08:38.236
Safety off!

08:38.270 --> 08:40.472
We gotta get out of here!

08:41.774 --> 08:44.608
It's just a really good replica
of an emergency exit!

08:44.642 --> 08:46.877
It's so accurate!

08:52.717 --> 08:55.051
This isn't real either!

08:55.086 --> 08:56.286
None of it's real!

08:56.320 --> 08:59.154
There are no actual safety
precautions in this museum!

08:59.189 --> 09:00.890
What do we do?!

09:00.924 --> 09:02.558
I'll tell you what to do...

09:02.593 --> 09:03.993
if you're ready to listen.

09:04.027 --> 09:05.595
Roger! What are you
doing here?!

09:05.629 --> 09:07.597
Don't worry, I know everything
that's gonna happen.

09:07.631 --> 09:08.898
Hayley, take the traffic cones

09:08.932 --> 09:10.800
and make them
into a "U" over there!

09:10.834 --> 09:12.201
Francine, grab that wheelchair!

09:12.235 --> 09:13.703
Stan, get
that fire extinguisher!

09:13.737 --> 09:15.704
Steve, put
that bulletproof vest on!

09:15.738 --> 09:18.774
Wait a minute,
shouldn't we all get vests?

09:21.477 --> 09:23.077
I wrote this 14 minutes ago,

09:23.112 --> 09:24.212
because in my vision,

09:24.246 --> 09:26.114
you asked me that
exact stupid question.

09:26.148 --> 09:28.049
Now do what I say!

09:39.260 --> 09:41.128
Oh, no,
they're gonna trample us!

09:41.162 --> 09:42.897
Just stay behind the cones!

09:48.803 --> 09:50.603
Oh, my God, it hurts!

09:50.638 --> 09:52.806
Why didn't you just have me
stand somewhere else?!

09:52.840 --> 09:55.141
Less fun.
Everybody climb on!

10:06.753 --> 10:08.887
Oh, my God, Roger, you saved...

10:08.922 --> 10:11.523
Hold on.
Wait for it.

10:13.760 --> 10:15.293
My car!

10:15.328 --> 10:18.396
And I'm pretty sure that
warrants a trip to Cold Stone.

10:18.431 --> 10:21.065
Roger, you were right
about everything!

10:21.099 --> 10:22.900
We should have listened to you.

10:22.935 --> 10:24.335
Oh, I'll accept your apology.

10:24.369 --> 10:27.171
And the lanyard you made me
at Camp Shoulda Woulda Coulda.

10:27.205 --> 10:29.807
I can't believe that Roger can
see the future.

10:29.842 --> 10:31.041
Now hold on.

10:31.076 --> 10:32.977
I don't know if it proves that.

10:33.011 --> 10:34.711
You know that note I gave you?

10:34.745 --> 10:35.879
Turn it over.

10:35.913 --> 10:37.647
This is my cell phone number.

10:37.682 --> 10:40.083
Excuse me, Miss.
Are you all right?

10:40.117 --> 10:42.151
Light him up, girl.

10:42.186 --> 10:43.753
He's not gonna call.

10:43.788 --> 10:45.555
He thinks you could
lose ten pounds.

10:45.590 --> 10:47.190
But that's not why
he doesn't call.

10:47.224 --> 10:48.625
He dies in that fire.

10:48.659 --> 10:51.460
So you didn't need to tell me
about the ten pounds.

10:51.495 --> 10:53.161
<i>Somebody</i> needed to tell you.

10:56.700 --> 10:59.702
I can't believe Roger
can predict the future.

10:59.736 --> 11:01.069
Yeah, but, like,

11:01.104 --> 11:02.938
compared to people
from the past,

11:02.973 --> 11:04.707
like, to them,

11:04.741 --> 11:06.841
like, we are the
future to them.

11:08.143 --> 11:10.111
I'm definitely feeling it now.

11:11.146 --> 11:12.714
That was amazing, Roger!

11:12.748 --> 11:14.382
See what happens
when you listen to me?

11:14.416 --> 11:15.717
He picked every horse!

11:15.751 --> 11:17.351
Roger's unbelievable!

11:17.386 --> 11:19.506
- He... - Knew that you'd want to eat
chili dogs for lunch.

11:19.522 --> 11:21.022
And then he...
Knew in the third race

11:21.056 --> 11:23.490
it'd take three bullets to put
down Daddy's Lucky Girl.

11:23.525 --> 11:25.458
And now I'm...
Getting tired of me interrupting you?

11:25.493 --> 11:26.793
How did you...
Know?

11:26.828 --> 11:28.829
You just gave me goose bumps!

11:28.863 --> 11:30.030
I love it!

11:30.064 --> 11:31.698
Speaking of love, Roger,

11:31.733 --> 11:33.333
there's another girl
in my class

11:33.367 --> 11:34.835
I think I have
a pretty good shot with.

11:34.869 --> 11:36.436
Oh?
Well, allow me.

11:36.470 --> 11:37.504
Come here, you...

11:51.685 --> 11:52.752
Roger, what's so funny?

11:52.786 --> 11:53.753
Nothing.

11:53.787 --> 11:55.020
I say go for it.

12:00.426 --> 12:02.594
Hey, uh, I was gonna go
take a dip in the pool.

12:02.628 --> 12:04.529
How-how's that
work out for me?

12:04.564 --> 12:06.464
Stan, I'm not wasting
my gift on that.

12:06.498 --> 12:07.465
Come on, Roger.

12:07.499 --> 12:09.133
Touch it.

12:09.168 --> 12:10.568
You drop a load in the pool.

12:10.602 --> 12:11.569
Wait, no.

12:11.603 --> 12:13.203
It's a Baby Ruth.
Wait, no.

12:13.237 --> 12:14.838
That's a scene
from <i>Caddyshack...</i>

12:14.873 --> 12:16.440
which I'm trying to watch.

12:16.474 --> 12:17.841
Do I end up
watching it with you?

12:17.876 --> 12:19.843
Yes, and you annoy me
the whole time

12:19.878 --> 12:20.844
with your questions.

12:20.879 --> 12:22.646
Oh.

12:22.681 --> 12:24.915
What kind of questions?

12:29.152 --> 12:30.987
Roger, am I gonna
like this salad?

12:31.021 --> 12:32.421
Should I be taking
smaller bites?

12:32.456 --> 12:34.223
Roger, am I about to say
something funny?

12:34.257 --> 12:35.625
I want to say something funny.

12:35.659 --> 12:37.293
Is that enough?

12:37.327 --> 12:39.395
Is... is... is-is that...

12:39.429 --> 12:40.730
Is that too much?

12:40.764 --> 12:41.864
How... how 'bout...
how 'bout now?

12:41.899 --> 12:43.599
Steve, dump that and get
yourself another salad.

12:43.633 --> 12:44.866
Why?

12:44.901 --> 12:46.367
Does something happen
to me if I eat this salad?

12:46.402 --> 12:48.003
No, I'm just using
common sense.

12:48.037 --> 12:50.472
Well, can't you just have
a vision so I can be sure?

12:50.506 --> 12:51.873
So it doesn't matter
what I think?

12:51.908 --> 12:53.308
No, we don't care
what you think,

12:53.342 --> 12:55.343
we care what you see.

12:56.512 --> 12:57.779
Well, fine.

12:57.814 --> 12:59.146
If that's all you're after...

12:59.180 --> 13:01.148
Wait, where are you going?

13:01.182 --> 13:02.316
Should we go with you?

13:02.350 --> 13:04.551
Should I have even
left the kitchen?

13:04.586 --> 13:06.220
Look, no more questions.

13:06.254 --> 13:07.588
I need to take
a thinkin' drive.

13:07.623 --> 13:08.823
Wait, wait, you can't leave!

13:08.857 --> 13:09.957
I have homework tonight!

13:09.992 --> 13:11.291
Is it gonna be
on the test tomorrow

13:11.326 --> 13:12.292
or can I blow it off?

13:12.327 --> 13:13.861
Should I take a bath tonight

13:13.895 --> 13:15.895
or will I fall
asleep and drown?

13:15.930 --> 13:16.997
Do I have to go
to the bathroom?

13:17.031 --> 13:18.271
Look, you guys are on your own.

13:18.298 --> 13:19.265
I'm outta here.

13:19.299 --> 13:20.867
At least let us come with you!

13:20.901 --> 13:22.002
No, you should...

13:22.036 --> 13:23.302
you should... you should
probably stay here.

13:23.337 --> 13:25.438
Why? Are we all gonna die
if we come with you?

13:25.472 --> 13:26.840
Yes.

13:26.874 --> 13:28.174
That.

13:28.208 --> 13:29.509
You're all gonna die

13:29.543 --> 13:31.576
if you leave the house.

13:31.611 --> 13:33.411
Slam that door if
I get really rich soon!

13:35.715 --> 13:38.283
Oh, so close!

13:40.153 --> 13:42.387
Well, I wanted them
to listen to me.

13:42.421 --> 13:44.589
Didn't work out so well,
though, did it?

13:44.624 --> 13:46.658
No, sir.

13:46.692 --> 13:48.259
There might be a lesson
to learn from this

13:48.293 --> 13:50.028
if I were the kind of guy
who could learn lessons.

13:50.062 --> 13:51.529
But lessons are not for me.

13:51.563 --> 13:53.064
Lessons are for school boys.

13:53.098 --> 13:54.365
School boys are for me!

13:54.399 --> 13:55.366
Red light!

14:03.141 --> 14:05.275
Ah, what a restful coma.

14:05.792 --> 14:06.798
How long have I been out?

14:06.918 --> 14:07.878
Three weeks.

14:07.912 --> 14:09.880
We would have been able
to revive you sooner,

14:09.914 --> 14:12.081
but Dr. Stack was
the coma expert

14:12.115 --> 14:14.150
and he got fired
and sued into poverty

14:14.185 --> 14:16.686
by a grieving widow and
her Rastafarian fiancé.

14:16.720 --> 14:17.853
Huh.

14:17.888 --> 14:19.855
So... can I get
an orange juice,

14:19.890 --> 14:22.258
or is there a long-ass
story about that, too?

14:22.293 --> 14:23.493
Lunch'll be here in 20 minutes.

14:23.527 --> 14:24.627
You can wait till then.

14:24.662 --> 14:25.961
Hmm.
Nice attitude.

14:25.996 --> 14:28.096
Let's see how you die!

14:28.130 --> 14:29.264
Wait!

14:29.299 --> 14:30.420
I'm not getting any visions.

14:30.433 --> 14:32.534
My powers are gone!

14:32.569 --> 14:34.903
But I haven't lost mine.

14:34.937 --> 14:37.573
<i>Mind Quad!</i>

14:37.607 --> 14:40.209
Sounds like you're
thirsty, friend.

14:51.587 --> 14:53.621
I'm not gonna drink from
the same glass as him.

14:53.655 --> 14:54.888
He's gross.

15:00.698 --> 15:03.400
So you had powers
and now you lost them?

15:03.434 --> 15:04.601
It's like me.

15:04.635 --> 15:06.270
In my country, I'm doctor.

15:06.304 --> 15:07.637
Really?
What kind of doctor?

15:07.672 --> 15:09.572
Dah, you caught me.

15:09.607 --> 15:10.908
I'm lying.

15:13.343 --> 15:14.677
What the...

15:16.346 --> 15:18.080
Roger, thank God you're back!

15:18.115 --> 15:19.415
Everybody, Roger's back!

15:19.449 --> 15:21.750
Oh, Roger, what a relief!

15:21.785 --> 15:23.820
We don't have
to be scared anymore.

15:23.854 --> 15:26.722
Yeah, maybe we can
leave the house now.

15:26.756 --> 15:27.889
Wait a minute.

15:27.924 --> 15:29.564
You haven't left
the house in three weeks?

15:29.591 --> 15:31.592
You told us we'd
all die if we did.

15:31.627 --> 15:33.561
And all of your
fortunes have come true!

15:33.595 --> 15:35.563
Huh.
I guess I did say that.

15:35.597 --> 15:36.898
But how have you survived?

15:36.933 --> 15:38.133
It hasn't been easy.

15:38.167 --> 15:39.868
The toilet paper ran
out before the food,

15:39.902 --> 15:41.102
so that was gross.

15:41.137 --> 15:42.904
But when we started
eating the couch,

15:42.939 --> 15:44.179
we stopped needing
toilet paper.

15:44.206 --> 15:46.240
The stuffing wipes
itself on the way out.

15:46.274 --> 15:47.875
Okay, this is bad.

15:47.909 --> 15:49.409
Wait, wait, where's Klaus?

15:49.444 --> 15:50.577
I'm right here.

15:50.611 --> 15:52.546
Oh, my God, Klaus,

15:52.580 --> 15:54.014
you're living in
your own filth.

15:54.049 --> 15:55.282
I try not to talk

15:55.317 --> 15:56.717
so it doesn't get in my mouth.

15:58.586 --> 16:00.386
Ugh, it got in my mouth.

16:00.420 --> 16:02.021
Brissam beeginch?

16:02.056 --> 16:03.056
R-Rettehsat?

16:03.090 --> 16:04.590
Okay, what is that?

16:04.624 --> 16:07.927
Oh, in your absence
Steve's forgotten English.

16:07.962 --> 16:09.095
Eng...

16:09.129 --> 16:10.696
Engrish.

16:10.731 --> 16:12.999
How did my absence
in any way affect

16:13.033 --> 16:15.034
Steve's handle on
the English language?

16:15.069 --> 16:16.568
I haven't even
been gone a month.

16:16.602 --> 16:18.536
Steve...

16:18.571 --> 16:20.405
Mo-onth.

16:20.439 --> 16:21.406
All right, all right.

16:21.440 --> 16:22.807
Before I left, I told you guys

16:22.842 --> 16:24.542
not to leave the house
and you embraced it.

16:24.577 --> 16:25.911
Now I'm telling you you'll die

16:25.945 --> 16:27.479
if you don't get
out of this house.

16:27.513 --> 16:28.747
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:28.781 --> 16:29.948
Don't you want to
have a vision,

16:29.983 --> 16:31.049
make sure it's safe?

16:31.084 --> 16:32.416
Oh, uh, yeah, sure.

16:33.919 --> 16:35.987
Yes, my vision says
you will be super safe.

16:36.021 --> 16:37.421
Get out there!

16:48.266 --> 16:50.233
Soba slasha on...

16:50.268 --> 16:51.234
Steve's right.

16:51.269 --> 16:52.769
It's just the sprinklers.

16:55.940 --> 16:57.173
Whoops.

16:58.976 --> 17:00.476
Flaps flaps ze zap zap!

17:00.511 --> 17:02.645
It's not safe!
It's not safe!

17:02.679 --> 17:03.646
We almost got killed.

17:05.147 --> 17:06.115
Steve's right.

17:06.148 --> 17:07.848
You lied to us.

17:07.884 --> 17:09.385
Uch, you got me.

17:09.419 --> 17:10.618
I lost my powers.

17:10.653 --> 17:12.253
Now we can go back
to our normal lives.

17:12.289 --> 17:13.255
Isn't that great?

17:13.290 --> 17:14.556
No, it's not great!

17:14.589 --> 17:16.625
Without your powers,
we have no idea

17:16.659 --> 17:18.693
what dangers are lurking
outside this house!

17:18.728 --> 17:21.095
Yeah, but there is nothing
you can do about it.

17:22.696 --> 17:24.332
How useless was that Costco

17:24.366 --> 17:26.500
five-pack of hammers now,
Francine?

17:26.535 --> 17:28.669
Look, I'm helping!

17:28.703 --> 17:30.171
You guys, listen...

17:33.275 --> 17:34.508
Oh, my God, what was that?

17:34.543 --> 17:35.509
I don't know!

17:35.544 --> 17:36.509
Let's hide in the basement!

17:36.544 --> 17:38.111
Steve, your English is back.

17:38.146 --> 17:40.147
Oh, I was just doing that
to make you guys laugh.

17:46.321 --> 17:47.620
My protein powder!

17:47.655 --> 17:48.755
There are tracks in it.

17:48.789 --> 17:50.824
We got tracks!

17:54.394 --> 17:55.561
Somebody used my Rowflex!

17:55.595 --> 17:57.863
And it's set to
the highest strength level.

17:57.897 --> 17:58.864
Cuddles!

17:58.898 --> 18:00.099
I forgot about him.

18:00.133 --> 18:01.100
He must've escaped.

18:01.134 --> 18:02.368
Wait a minute.

18:02.402 --> 18:04.403
You don't think he
got into my protein powder

18:04.438 --> 18:05.804
and then started and stuck with

18:05.839 --> 18:07.506
a hard-core workout regimen,
do you?

18:07.540 --> 18:11.209
Oh, God, how big do you think
he could have gotten?

18:11.243 --> 18:13.211
Hmm, I'd say about
eight feet tall.

18:13.245 --> 18:14.479
Oh, how do you know?

18:14.513 --> 18:16.081
Did you have a vision of it?

18:16.115 --> 18:18.083
He's standing right there.

18:19.618 --> 18:20.618
Run!

18:26.424 --> 18:27.657
You know what?

18:27.692 --> 18:28.892
I think we can make this work.

18:28.893 --> 18:30.794
We'll just all live here
the rest of our lives.

18:30.828 --> 18:31.962
I call the tub!

18:31.997 --> 18:33.597
You guys are ready to live

18:33.631 --> 18:35.599
the rest of your lives
in this bathroom?

18:35.633 --> 18:38.335
Sounds like someone's
jealous of my tub.

18:38.370 --> 18:39.936
Don't you guys get it?

18:39.971 --> 18:42.038
Even if we could
stay alive in here,

18:42.072 --> 18:44.007
what kind of life would that be?

18:44.041 --> 18:46.009
Life is risky,

18:46.043 --> 18:48.444
but you have to get out there
and take chances anyway.

18:48.479 --> 18:49.712
Why should we listen to you?

18:49.746 --> 18:51.680
Well, maybe he's right.

18:51.715 --> 18:53.249
I mean, we can't
go through life

18:53.283 --> 18:54.884
without taking any risks.

18:54.918 --> 18:56.385
Yeah, it's like
when Eddie Murphy

18:56.419 --> 18:57.785
picked up that prostitute.

18:57.820 --> 18:59.021
But that was a man.

18:59.055 --> 19:01.189
And he had a marvelous time.

19:01.224 --> 19:04.393
I'm just asking you
to listen to me this once.

19:06.129 --> 19:07.262
Okay.

19:07.296 --> 19:09.498
But how are we gonna
fight a giant raccoon?

19:09.532 --> 19:10.665
We don't have to fight it.

19:10.699 --> 19:12.699
All we have to do is
get out of the house.

19:12.734 --> 19:14.535
Quick, get the boards
off the door.

19:15.803 --> 19:17.071
We could really use
those hammers now,

19:17.105 --> 19:18.072
to pull these nails out.

19:18.106 --> 19:19.073
Anybody see one?

19:22.411 --> 19:24.311
Quick, everybody link arms.

19:24.346 --> 19:25.946
He'll think we're
a bigger animal.

19:25.980 --> 19:27.114
Hmm?

19:34.855 --> 19:36.389
Wait, Steve, that's good.
Ow, ow!

19:36.424 --> 19:37.390
Ah!
Keep doing that!

19:37.425 --> 19:38.391
Keep doing what?!

19:38.426 --> 19:39.926
He thinks you're food.

19:39.960 --> 19:41.894
That'll distract him long enough
for us to get the boards off.

19:41.929 --> 19:43.329
Ow, ow!

19:43.364 --> 19:45.164
What if he bites off my arm?

19:45.198 --> 19:46.365
That's the risk!

19:46.399 --> 19:47.966
That's the risk
we're all taking!

19:49.936 --> 19:51.937
Yah!

20:10.189 --> 20:12.957
He had a weirdly good body.

20:15.561 --> 20:17.695
I guess we owe you
a "thanks," Roger.

20:17.729 --> 20:20.130
It seems like knowing
what the future holds

20:20.164 --> 20:22.365
can really keep you from
living in the present.

20:22.400 --> 20:24.668
Yeah, maybe sometimes

20:24.703 --> 20:26.971
it's not a bad idea
to listen to Roger.

20:27.005 --> 20:28.138
Damn right!

20:28.172 --> 20:29.840
Now, let's cover
ourselves in honey

20:29.874 --> 20:32.076
and run through Old Man
McGuilicutty's bear farm.

20:32.110 --> 20:34.510
This is not one of those times.

20:34.544 --> 20:36.813
Hey, can you drop me
off at the hospital?

20:39.316 --> 20:41.317
No, sorry, I don't
see that happening.

20:41.351 --> 20:42.619
I'm kidding.

20:42.653 --> 20:44.654
Come on, let's go, kid.

20:46.059 --> 20:47.848
Hey, hey, why you
smacking your tushie?

20:47.968 --> 20:50.438
Why you smacking your tushie?
Why you doing that?

20:50.558 --> 20:51.991
Stop, stop! Stop it!

20:52.329 --> 20:59.524
