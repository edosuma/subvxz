<i>Man: Studio
this is Master Control.</i>

02:34:30.067 --> 02:34:32.900
-- <i>You're up on router 7. Have</i> a <i>good show.
Dana: Thank you.</i>

02:34:32.970 --> 02:34:35.905
<i>Will: Stand by audio, stand by VTR.
Natalie: Four minutes out.</i>

02:34:35.973 --> 02:34:38.738
<i>Janie, I need you standing by for
a possible comeback after 5:00.</i>

02:34:38.809 --> 02:34:40.277
Andruw Jones is spelled
with a

02:34:40.344 --> 02:34:42.039
And Cris Collinsworth
doesn't have an

02:34:42.112 --> 02:34:43.807
-- Doesn't have an "H"?
-- Doesn't have an

02:34:43.881 --> 02:34:46.282
-- Why doesn't Collinsworth have an “H“?
-- It never had an

02:34:46.350 --> 02:34:47.613
<i>It has an “H" at the end.</i>

02:34:47.685 --> 02:34:48.948
He's saying "Cris"
doesn't have an

02:34:49.019 --> 02:34:51.488
Anybody know why there's
a 20-pound frozen turkey

02:34:51.555 --> 02:34:53.080
up in the light grid?

02:34:53.157 --> 02:34:54.750
Dana,
Elliott wants to know

02:34:54.825 --> 02:34:57.851
why there's a 20-pound frozen
turkey in the light grid.

02:34:57.928 --> 02:34:59.293
It's 24 pounds.

02:34:59.363 --> 02:35:00.330
I'll tell him that,

02:35:00.397 --> 02:35:02.092
but then he'll probably
just want to know

02:35:02.166 --> 02:35:04.498
why there's a 24-pound frozen
turkey in the light grid.

02:35:04.568 --> 02:35:08.471
<i>Why is there a 24-pound frozen
turkey up in the light grid?</i>

02:35:08.539 --> 02:35:11.440
-- <i>I'm thawing it out.</i> -- <i>You're thawing
out</i> a <i>turkey on the fight grid?</i>

02:35:11.508 --> 02:35:12.839
Anybody got a problem
with that?

02:35:12.910 --> 02:35:13.877
-- Not me.
-- Cool with me.

02:35:14.878 --> 02:35:16.539
It's like a week before
Thanksgiving.

02:35:16.613 --> 02:35:19.139
-- This is just a dry run.
-- A dry run on the turkey?

02:35:19.216 --> 02:35:21.651
My whole family's coming
to New York -- 18 people.

02:35:21.719 --> 02:35:23.881
-- And this is your first time
making the dinner? -- Yes.

02:35:23.954 --> 02:35:25.547
-- It's a rite of passage
into adulthood. -- Yes.

02:35:25.622 --> 02:35:27.351
It's a time for giving thanks,

02:35:27.424 --> 02:35:30.155
a time to share in the warm
embrace of family.

02:35:30.227 --> 02:35:32.457
-- Right. You don't want to take any crap
from your mother. -- I really don't.

02:35:32.529 --> 02:35:35.499
-- You're doing the right thing. -- I
need to see how long it takes to thaw.

02:35:35.566 --> 02:35:36.226
Three minutes in.

02:35:36.300 --> 02:35:37.563
By {he way...

02:35:37.634 --> 02:35:39.398
you know what today is?

02:35:39.470 --> 02:35:41.404
-- It's Monday.
-- What else?

02:35:41.472 --> 02:35:43.338
Uh, it's November 23rd.

02:35:43.407 --> 02:35:45.307
And what does that mean?

02:35:45.376 --> 02:35:46.537
Come on.

02:35:46.610 --> 02:35:48.009
November 23rd.

02:35:48.078 --> 02:35:49.671
What happened
on this date?

02:35:49.747 --> 02:35:51.875
-- Boston College upsets Notre Dame?
-- VVrong.

02:35:51.949 --> 02:35:53.747
-- Gretzky's 500th goal?
-- Think.

02:35:53.817 --> 02:35:56.218
-- Alberto Salazar wins his
fourth New York Marathon? -- No.

02:35:56.286 --> 02:35:58.380
Alberto Salazar wins his
<i>third</i> New York Marathon?

02:35:58.455 --> 02:36:00.389
-- Casey, you're not -- --
Does it have anything to do

02:36:00.457 --> 02:36:02.926
-- with Alberto Salazar or the
New York Marathon? -- No.

02:36:02.993 --> 02:36:04.586
-- Let me take one more stab at it.
-- Go.

02:36:04.661 --> 02:36:06.857
Alberto Salazar wins his
<i>second</i> New York marathon?

02:36:06.930 --> 02:36:09.024
-- Casey...forget about it.
-- Come on, what is it?

02:36:09.099 --> 02:36:11.500
-- Come on. -- No, forget about it.
Forget about it.

02:36:11.568 --> 02:36:14.094
Kim, this is my daughter's
number in San Francisco.

02:36:14.171 --> 02:36:16.731
-- VVould you keep trying her
for me, please? -- Sure.

02:36:16.807 --> 02:36:18.002
Is there a problem
with Kathy?

02:36:18.075 --> 02:36:20.169
There's no problem,
but she's due in 10 days.

02:36:20.244 --> 02:36:22.508
Esther flew out there
this morning to be with her.

02:36:22.579 --> 02:36:23.978
She should've landed
by now,

02:36:24.048 --> 02:36:26.073
but I haven't heard
from either of them yet.

02:36:26.150 --> 02:36:27.049
30 seconds to VTR.

02:36:27.117 --> 02:36:28.778
Have a good show,
everybody.

02:36:28.852 --> 02:36:30.718
Isaac, Esther and Kathy
are fine.

02:36:30.788 --> 02:36:32.654
You're gonna be
a grandfather in 10 days,

02:36:32.723 --> 02:36:34.350
so try not to make
everybody crazy.

02:36:34.425 --> 02:36:36.519
Esther and I had a fight
this morning before she left.

02:36:36.593 --> 02:36:38.459
-- What about?
-- Nothing.

02:36:38.529 --> 02:36:39.860
Kim, keep calling.

02:36:39.930 --> 02:36:41.921
<i>Casey: Jeremy...</i>

02:36:41.999 --> 02:36:44.900
<i>November 23rd --
does that date ring a bell?</i>

02:36:44.968 --> 02:36:46.959
And don't go
to the computer.

02:36:47.037 --> 02:36:48.869
-- Don't have to.
-- What is it?

02:36:48.939 --> 02:36:51.533
It was on this day
in 534 B.C.

02:36:51.608 --> 02:36:53.201
that Thespis stepped out
onto the stage

02:36:53.277 --> 02:36:55.405
of the Theater Dionysus
during a choral song and dance

02:36:55.479 --> 02:36:56.810
and became the first man

02:36:56.880 --> 02:36:59.110
to speak words
as an actor in a play.

02:37:02.486 --> 02:37:04.750
-- Tell me I was supposed to know that.
-- I don't want to talk about it.

02:37:04.822 --> 02:37:06.483
<i>Dave: 60 in. Roll VTR.</i>

02:37:06.557 --> 02:37:07.820
Thespis?

02:37:07.891 --> 02:37:10.087
The first actor,
now a mischievous ghost.

02:37:10.160 --> 02:37:12.424
He likes to wreak havoc
on performances of any kind.

02:37:12.496 --> 02:37:14.396
I'd brace yourself
for a strange show tonight.

02:37:14.465 --> 02:37:15.728
It's not gonna be
a strange show.

02:37:15.799 --> 02:37:17.130
He might wreak havoc.

02:37:17.201 --> 02:37:19.397
-- He's not gonna wreak havoc.
-- He might.

02:37:19.470 --> 02:37:21.495
This show's locked up
tight as a drum.

02:37:21.572 --> 02:37:22.630
Thespis likes a challenge.

02:37:22.706 --> 02:37:24.504
Thespis has been dead
for 2,500 years.

02:37:24.575 --> 02:37:26.873
You really think you should
be baiting him like this?

02:37:26.944 --> 02:37:28.571
"I fear not ghosts.
I fear them not."

02:37:28.645 --> 02:37:29.976
Your courage
is an inspiration.

02:37:30.047 --> 02:37:31.913
You're just messing
with me, right?

02:37:31.982 --> 02:37:34.076
-- Sure. -- <i>The ShOW'S
gonna be fine tonight...</i>

02:37:34.151 --> 02:37:35.585
-- Yes.
-- tight as a drum.

02:37:35.652 --> 02:37:37.313
-- You betcha.
-- [ Gasps, thud]

02:37:39.356 --> 02:37:41.882
All right, [Clears throat]
why wasn't I briefed

02:37:41.959 --> 02:37:43.825
about this Thespis
thing before?

02:37:43.894 --> 02:37:46.056
-- Dana, I -- -- Did you know
about this Thespis thing?

02:37:46.130 --> 02:37:49.156
It's bad to panic, Dana. Thespis
can smell fear a mile away.

02:37:49.233 --> 02:37:52.032
-- All right, we just need to get through
the top half-hour. -- That's right.

02:37:52.102 --> 02:37:53.934
Anything that ever
goes wrong with the show

02:37:54.004 --> 02:37:56.098
-- goes wrong during the top half-hour.
-- Nothing's going wrong.

02:37:56.173 --> 02:37:57.868
Not if we can get through
the top half-hour.

02:37:57.941 --> 02:37:59.500
-- Mortals.
-- Jeremy!

02:37:59.576 --> 02:38:02.170
Thespis likes to play
the full 60 minutes.

02:38:02.246 --> 02:38:03.771
-- Give me one more hint.
-- Forget about it.

02:38:03.847 --> 02:38:06.179
-- Danny... -- It's not important.
-- In <i>3...2...</i>

02:38:06.250 --> 02:38:08.241
Good evening.
From New York City,

02:38:08.318 --> 02:38:10.650
I'm Dan Rydell
alongside Casey McCall.

02:38:10.721 --> 02:38:12.917
Those stories, plus we're gonna
take a swing through the NFL,

02:38:12.990 --> 02:38:14.685
where there were more than
a few upsets yesterday.

02:38:14.758 --> 02:38:16.556
We'll take you out
to Pauley Pavilion

02:38:16.627 --> 02:38:18.527
for a Pac-10 matchup
you won't believe,

02:38:18.595 --> 02:38:20.495
and we'll take you out
to Watkins Glen

02:38:20.564 --> 02:38:22.965
for a NASCAR rules explanation
we can't understand.

02:38:23.033 --> 02:38:24.660
All that coming up
after this.

02:38:24.735 --> 02:38:26.829
You're watching “Sports Night“
on CSC, so stick around.

02:38:26.904 --> 02:38:28.338
-- <i>We're out.
Natalie." We're in commercial.</i>

02:38:28.405 --> 02:38:31.102
-- Two minutes back.
-- 28 minutes to go.

02:38:35.412 --> 02:38:37.904
The MLS,
Major League Soccer --

02:38:37.981 --> 02:38:39.244
and if you know me,

02:38:39.316 --> 02:38:42.581
you know I eat, drink,
and breathe soccer.

02:38:42.653 --> 02:38:45.281
Without delay,
the Miami Fusion,

02:38:45.355 --> 02:38:47.483
<i>the D.C. United --
let's go to the action.</i>

02:38:47.558 --> 02:38:49.424
<i>Blake kicks the ball
with high hopes</i>

02:38:49.493 --> 02:38:51.655
<i>that it'll enter the goal,
but it does not.</i>

02:38:51.728 --> 02:38:52.957
Stand by 22.

02:38:53.030 --> 02:38:55.829
Give me a preview on FX 7, V.O.
9, and show me the board.

02:38:55.899 --> 02:38:57.492
-- He doesn't know the route.
-- Here's 7.

02:38:57.568 --> 02:38:59.798
Man: Here's 9. -- Show me the board.
-- Board's up.

02:38:59.870 --> 02:39:02.168
Asked him to rehearse the
route, but he wouldn't listen.

02:39:02.239 --> 02:39:03.502
You're babbling, Isaac.

02:39:03.574 --> 02:39:05.508
-- He hasn't rehearsed the route.
-- Who?

02:39:05.576 --> 02:39:06.941
Douglas, my son-in-law.

02:39:07.010 --> 02:39:09.775
How can he find the hospital if
he hasn't rehearsed the route?

02:39:09.846 --> 02:39:12.508
Isn't Douglas
a radar officer in the Navy?

02:39:12.583 --> 02:39:14.677
Yes, and if we were
scrambling F-16s,

02:39:14.751 --> 02:39:18.119
I'd trust him to find the flight
deck of the USS Cora! Sea,

02:39:18.188 --> 02:39:21.180
but we're having a baby, and you
can't find Berkeley General

02:39:21.258 --> 02:39:23.249
unless you rehearse
the route.

02:39:23.327 --> 02:39:24.385
Think that's crazy?

02:39:24.461 --> 02:39:26.930
<i>No crazier than thawing out
a turkey on the light grid.</i>

02:39:26.997 --> 02:39:29.625
-- What are you doing on the light grid? --
It's not important. [Chuckles nervously]

02:39:29.700 --> 02:39:31.099
Isaac, it's your wife.

02:39:31.168 --> 02:39:32.693
-- Oh, finally.
-- You see?

02:39:32.769 --> 02:39:34.863
<i>Man: Stand by
FX 7, V.O. 12.</i>

02:39:34.938 --> 02:39:36.133
<i>Casey: Good.</i>

02:39:36.206 --> 02:39:37.696
With the NHL season
well underway,

02:39:37.774 --> 02:39:39.674
one of the big questions
on the minds of fans

02:39:39.743 --> 02:39:42.474
is if the defending-champion Red
VVings will pull off a three-peat

02:39:42.546 --> 02:39:44.605
and drink from
Lord Stanley's Cup once again.

02:39:44.681 --> 02:39:46.513
-- <i>Ready five.</i>
-- <i>For more on that,</i>

02:39:46.583 --> 02:39:48.073
we go to Tracy Heller,
who's standing outside

02:39:48.151 --> 02:39:49.380
the Detroit Wed Wings
rocker room.

02:39:50.587 --> 02:39:52.555
-- Red Wings rocker room.
-- Oh, <i>man.</i>

02:39:52.623 --> 02:39:53.818
[Laughs]

02:39:53.890 --> 02:39:56.723
Or possibly the Detroit
Red Wings locker room.

02:39:56.793 --> 02:39:58.955
-- <i>Take five.</i> -- <i>Natalie:
2 1/2 minutes back.</i>

02:39:59.029 --> 02:39:59.996
Thespis?

02:40:00.063 --> 02:40:01.656
It's his special day.

02:40:01.732 --> 02:40:03.962
Let me take one more shot at it.
Is it, um --

02:40:04.034 --> 02:40:05.331
Our anniversary.

02:40:05.402 --> 02:40:07.302
Our anniversary?

02:40:07.371 --> 02:40:09.635
Our anniversary.
Today is our anniversary.

02:40:09.706 --> 02:40:12.403
Jeez, Dan, that night in
Minneapolis with the Jagermeister,

02:40:12.476 --> 02:40:14.240
we didn't do anything
untoward, did we?

02:40:14.311 --> 02:40:15.540
-- You mean did we get married?
No. -- Yeah.

02:40:15.612 --> 02:40:16.704
Good.

02:40:16.780 --> 02:40:18.805
<i>We recited
the St. Crispin's Day speech</i>

02:40:18.882 --> 02:40:20.748
in the lobby
of the St. Paul Radisson.

02:40:20.817 --> 02:40:23.184
-- Was <i>it</i> untoward? -- No,
it was just embarrassing.

02:40:23.253 --> 02:40:24.948
So, uh, how is it
our anniversary?

02:40:25.022 --> 02:40:28.219
It's the anniversary of our first
show -- November 23rd, 5 years ago.

02:40:28.292 --> 02:40:30.351
No, we went on the air
two years last July.

02:40:30.427 --> 02:40:32.259
I'm not talking about
"Sports Night,"

02:40:32.329 --> 02:40:35.264
I'm talking about
our first broadcast.

02:40:35.332 --> 02:40:36.663
"Lone Star."

02:40:36.733 --> 02:40:38.724
"Lone Star Sports."

02:40:38.802 --> 02:40:40.201
November 23rd?

02:40:40.270 --> 02:40:42.102
That's right.

02:40:42.172 --> 02:40:44.834
What do you want
from me?

02:40:44.908 --> 02:40:46.672
Nothing, Casey.

02:40:46.743 --> 02:40:49.872
I'm just gonna sit over here
and do my show.

02:40:49.946 --> 02:40:52.381
Impersonating my ex-wife never
won anyone a place in my heart.

02:40:52.449 --> 02:40:55.043
-- It's an important day to me. --
It's an important day to me, too.

02:40:55.118 --> 02:40:57.177
[Laughs]
I don't think it is.

02:40:57.254 --> 02:41:00.087
-- How can I prove it to you? -- Remembering
it would be a step in the right direction.

02:41:00.157 --> 02:41:01.386
<i>One minute back.</i>

02:41:01.458 --> 02:41:03.426
So, Thespis is
the Roman god of theater?

02:41:03.493 --> 02:41:06.428
That's exactly right, except he's
not Roman, and he's not a god.

02:41:06.496 --> 02:41:08.521
-- What <i>is</i> he? -- <i>He's
Greek, and he's</i> a <i>ghost.</i>

02:41:08.598 --> 02:41:10.191
-- Who's Artemis?
-- Artemis?

02:41:10.267 --> 02:41:12.668
Artemis is goddess
of the moon, the hunt,

02:41:12.736 --> 02:41:14.101
chastity, and fertility.

02:41:14.171 --> 02:41:16.230
Ooh! Your boy knows
his mythology.

02:41:16.306 --> 02:41:18.707
-- Give him another one.
-- Athena.

02:41:18.775 --> 02:41:21.039
Goddess of wisdom,
the arts, and war.

02:41:21.111 --> 02:41:22.374
Mercury.

02:41:22.446 --> 02:41:25.381
God of commerce,
wrestling, gymnastics,

02:41:25.449 --> 02:41:28.908
thieving, good luck,
sleep, wealth, and dreams.

02:41:28.985 --> 02:41:29.918
<i>Wow.</i>

02:41:29.986 --> 02:41:31.317
There's a God of thieving?

02:41:31.388 --> 02:41:33.322
<i>There's a God
of gymnastics?</i>

02:41:33.390 --> 02:41:34.323
Yes, indeed.

02:41:34.391 --> 02:41:37.554
-- <i>10 seconds back.
Dave: Ready four.</i>

02:41:37.627 --> 02:41:39.425
I remember
what you were wearing.

02:41:39.496 --> 02:41:40.793
Do you remember
what I was wearing?

02:41:40.864 --> 02:41:43.094
I remember not thinking at
the time that you were a woman.

02:41:43.166 --> 02:41:45.157
In 3...2...

02:41:45.235 --> 02:41:47.897
Thanks, Tracy. You can see the Red
VVings take on the Maple Leafs

02:41:47.971 --> 02:41:49.700
tomorrow night at 7:30
right here on CSC,

02:41:49.773 --> 02:41:52.765
as Bob Lowry and Steve Capps bring you
all the action from Toronto. Casey.

02:41:52.843 --> 02:41:55.210
<i>Casey: The PGA tour
was in Scottsdale yesterday</i>

02:41:55.278 --> 02:41:57.542
<i>for the final round

02:41:57.614 --> 02:41:59.139
<i>Going into the 12th hole...</i>

02:41:59.216 --> 02:42:00.479
You and Esther make up?

02:42:00.550 --> 02:42:02.848
Kim, get me on the next flight
to San Francisco.

02:42:02.919 --> 02:42:04.512
-- What do you need --
-- Do it now, Kim.

02:42:04.588 --> 02:42:06.522
[Casey talking indistinctly]

02:42:08.525 --> 02:42:10.789
Uh, take over.

02:42:10.861 --> 02:42:12.852
Natalie's got the wheel,
everybody.

02:42:12.929 --> 02:42:14.522
<i>...can only be called
inspirational.</i>

02:42:14.598 --> 02:42:16.896
<i>The ball flew through the air
with the greatest of ease...</i>

02:42:16.967 --> 02:42:20.301
Put up 20, 21, and <i>22</i>
on a preview screen.

02:42:20.370 --> 02:42:21.769
Casey, heads up.

02:42:21.838 --> 02:42:24.364
I need you to stretch
a 20 blind roll into a 30.

02:42:24.441 --> 02:42:25.704
You all right?

02:42:25.776 --> 02:42:26.800
Yeah.

02:42:27.844 --> 02:42:29.334
<i>...on the leaderboard.
Dan.</i>

02:42:29.413 --> 02:42:31.939
<i>I'm gonna fly out
tonight, honey.</i>

02:42:32.015 --> 02:42:36.782
[TV volume decreases] I'll meet Mom
and your sister at the hospital.

02:42:36.853 --> 02:42:39.788
I'll have Carmen
stay there tonight.

02:42:39.856 --> 02:42:43.315
Honey, don't argue with me.

02:42:43.393 --> 02:42:45.885
I'll call you back
in a few minutes.

02:42:45.962 --> 02:42:47.361
I'll call you back.

02:42:49.132 --> 02:42:50.566
Get back to the control room.

02:42:50.634 --> 02:42:51.726
What's going on?

02:42:51.802 --> 02:42:53.998
Dana, get back to
the damn control room.

02:42:54.070 --> 02:42:56.562
Natalie's fine
for a couple of minutes.

02:42:56.640 --> 02:42:59.007
She's having an emergency
C-section.

02:42:59.075 --> 02:43:00.975
They're doing it right now.

02:43:01.044 --> 02:43:03.411
What happened?

02:43:03.480 --> 02:43:06.711
She was cleaning the kitchen
when Esther got there.

02:43:06.783 --> 02:43:09.218
Esther said
she doubled over in pain

02:43:09.286 --> 02:43:11.345
and started screaming.

02:43:11.421 --> 02:43:14.823
The O.B. said there was
massive internal bleeding.

02:43:14.891 --> 02:43:18.259
She was unconscious
when she got to the E.R.

02:43:18.328 --> 02:43:20.057
ls Kim working
on the plane tickets?

02:43:20.130 --> 02:43:22.656
Yes, yes.
Why don't you sit down?

02:43:25.435 --> 02:43:27.130
She's nine months pregnant.

02:43:27.204 --> 02:43:29.730
What's she doing
cleaning the kitchen?

02:43:29.806 --> 02:43:32.173
She's hoping to make a good
impression on her mother,

02:43:32.242 --> 02:43:33.801
but that's not why
she was bleeding.

02:43:33.877 --> 02:43:36.778
Did they say anything to you about
something called placenta previa?

02:43:36.847 --> 02:43:38.372
That's what it is.

02:43:38.448 --> 02:43:40.348
It happened to
my brother's wife, Shelly.

02:43:40.417 --> 02:43:42.715
Two weeks before she was due,
massive hemorrhaging,

02:43:42.786 --> 02:43:44.049
rushed to the hospital.

02:43:44.120 --> 02:43:46.350
-- What happened?
-- Shelly was fine.

02:43:46.423 --> 02:43:47.515
What about the baby?

02:43:48.658 --> 02:43:53.653
They lost the baby,
but Shelly was fine.

02:43:53.730 --> 02:43:55.721
[Sighs]

02:44:02.506 --> 02:44:04.065
[Sighs]

02:44:04.140 --> 02:44:06.268
You should get back
to the show.

02:44:06.343 --> 02:44:07.936
[sniffs]

02:44:08.011 --> 02:44:10.105
Yeah. Mmm...

02:44:10.180 --> 02:44:12.911
I'll be back
in a few minutes.

02:44:12.983 --> 02:44:14.246
Okay.

02:44:14.317 --> 02:44:16.251
-- You all right?
-- Yeah.

02:44:23.960 --> 02:44:25.860
<i>Casey: Miami of Ohio
and Bowling Green State</i>

02:44:25.929 --> 02:44:28.990
<i>aren't two teams that are normally
in the national spotlight</i>

02:44:29.065 --> 02:44:31.466
<i>unless you're speaking of
their departments of physics</i>

02:44:31.535 --> 02:44:33.503
<i>and Native American studies

02:44:33.570 --> 02:44:35.231
-- Thank <i>God.
Dana: What's going on?</i>

02:44:35.305 --> 02:44:36.568
We blew the cue at 44.

02:44:36.640 --> 02:44:38.404
Well, that's not so bad.
Anything else?

02:44:38.475 --> 02:44:40.876
We had the wrong V.O. at 42,
the wrong Chyron at 50,

02:44:40.944 --> 02:44:43.140
and we would've had
20 seconds of dead air at 55

02:44:43.213 --> 02:44:45.272
if Casey hadn't been
thinking on his feet.

02:44:45.348 --> 02:44:48.579
-- <i>VVhaFd</i> he <i>do?</i> -- <i>I think it was the St.
Crfspfn's Day speech. I'm not sure.</i>

02:44:48.652 --> 02:44:51.053
-- <i>She did fine.</i> -- <i>There's
water dripping on the desk.</i>

02:44:51.121 --> 02:44:52.452
-- What desk?
-- The anchor desk.

02:44:52.522 --> 02:44:55.116
Natalie, get someone up there
and find out what's going on.

02:44:55.191 --> 02:44:57.683
I was gone three minutes. ls there
anything that didn't get screwed up?

02:44:57.761 --> 02:44:59.855
-- We spelled Cris Collinsworth right.
-- Good.

02:44:59.930 --> 02:45:02.126
<i>Dave." In 3...2...</i>

02:45:02.198 --> 02:45:03.563
Thank you, Matt.

02:45:03.633 --> 02:45:06.933
We're gonna take a break for 2
1/2 minutes and pay some bills,

02:45:07.003 --> 02:45:09.097
<i>but when we come back, we're
gonna have college hoops,</i>

02:45:09.172 --> 02:45:13.131
bowl predictions, and a
steeplechase that got out of hand.

02:45:13.209 --> 02:45:16.338
You're watching “Sports Night“
on CSC, so don't go far.

02:45:16.413 --> 02:45:17.972
-- <i>We're out.</i>
-- <i>2 1/2 back.</i>

02:45:18.048 --> 02:45:19.709
Dana, what the hell's
going on?

02:45:19.783 --> 02:45:22.377
Listen to me, Isaac's having
a family emergency,

02:45:22.452 --> 02:45:25.114
but there's nothing we can do
about it from here.

02:45:25.188 --> 02:45:27.748
Everybody got that?
Get your heads in the game!

02:45:27.824 --> 02:45:30.191
We are gonna get through
the top half-hour!

02:45:30.260 --> 02:45:33.161
I'm not gonna be beaten
by a 6,000-year-old Roman god!

02:45:33.229 --> 02:45:35.027
He's a 3,000-year-old
Greek ghost.

02:45:35.098 --> 02:45:36.998
Well, I'm a 33-year-old
television producer,

02:45:37.067 --> 02:45:38.398
and for one hour
every night,

02:45:38.468 --> 02:45:40.869
this is my little corner
of the world,

02:45:40.937 --> 02:45:43.838
and nothing screws up here
unless I screw it up!

02:45:43.907 --> 02:45:46.376
You got that?!

02:45:46.443 --> 02:45:49.242
Why is there still water
dripping on this desk?!

02:45:55.919 --> 02:45:58.286
<i>Say, Dana...</i>

02:45:58.355 --> 02:46:00.687
this wouldn't happen to be
your frozen turkey

02:46:00.757 --> 02:46:02.418
by any chance,
now, would it?

02:46:04.427 --> 02:46:08.660
VVell, clearly I'm going to be
taking crap from my mother.

02:46:08.732 --> 02:46:10.325
<i>Man." Two minutes back.</i>

02:46:13.637 --> 02:46:16.129
In the NCAA, there ain't
no such thing as free lunches,

02:46:16.206 --> 02:46:19.176
much less free skybox tickets
or free hotel rooms.

02:46:19.242 --> 02:46:22.212
That's why Southern University
wideout Marcus Ryan

02:46:22.278 --> 02:46:24.144
will sit out two games.

02:46:24.214 --> 02:46:26.478
Ryan's suspension comes to
a total of five games...

02:46:26.549 --> 02:46:28.813
Ready S.O.T.

02:46:28.885 --> 02:46:31.320

-- Just answer me this. --
What are you, <i>the</i> Rfddfer?

02:46:33.156 --> 02:46:35.318
What was wrong with you
that day?

02:46:35.392 --> 02:46:37.759
-- <i>There was nothing</i> wrong.
-- <i>Why won't you tell me?</i>

02:46:37.827 --> 02:46:40.023
I was nervous.
It was our first show.

02:46:40.096 --> 02:46:42.963
-- You weren't nervous. There was something
wrong. -- Why are we still talking about this?

02:46:43.033 --> 02:46:44.592
Was it 'cause of what happened
with Conan O'Brien's show?

02:46:44.668 --> 02:46:45.931
It had nothing to do
with Conan's show.

02:46:46.002 --> 02:46:47.868
You've made way too much
out of that.

02:46:47.937 --> 02:46:49.268
-- In <i>3...</i> -- My name was
mentioned a couple times.

02:46:49.339 --> 02:46:51.273
-- <i>2...</i> -- I was never seriously
considered for the show.

02:46:51.341 --> 02:46:52.968
In this week's
police blotter,

02:46:53.043 --> 02:46:55.307
a judge in New York
has issued a court order

02:46:55.378 --> 02:46:57.870
for the arrest of former
defensive end Mark Gastin

02:46:57.947 --> 02:46:59.506
<i>for violating a court order,</i>

02:46:59.582 --> 02:47:01.175
while in a Houston courtroom,

02:47:01.251 --> 02:47:03.515
Sacramento backup
power forward Jason Grisham

02:47:03.586 --> 02:47:05.076
was pleading "no contest"

02:47:05.155 --> 02:47:08.557
to charges that he hit a fan over the
head with a bottle of fine cognac.

02:47:08.625 --> 02:47:11.185
For more psychotic behavior,
here's Jack Jankowitz.

02:47:11.261 --> 02:47:12.490
Yes, you were.

02:47:12.562 --> 02:47:13.996
Yes, I was, what?

02:47:14.064 --> 02:47:15.793
Being seriously considered
for Conan's show.

02:47:15.865 --> 02:47:18.732
-- <i>No,</i> I <i>wasn't.</i>
-- <i>Yes, you were,</i>

02:47:18.802 --> 02:47:21.328
<i>and when you didn't get it, you were stuck
doing a little sports show with me in Dallas.</i>

02:47:21.404 --> 02:47:23.498
-- <i>It was</i> a <i>good show,</i> Danny. --
<i>It wasn't good enough for Lisa.</i>

02:47:23.573 --> 02:47:25.371
Yeah, what Was good enough
for Lisa?!

02:47:25.442 --> 02:47:28.002
-- <i>What haven't you told me?</i>
-- <i>There's no mystery here.</i>

02:47:28.078 --> 02:47:30.911
Casey, I've known you for 10 years. We've
been working together for five of them.

02:47:30.980 --> 02:47:32.505
What haven't you told me?

02:47:32.582 --> 02:47:33.811
Natalie, how much time
do I have?

02:47:33.883 --> 02:47:35.180
Another 15 seconds
on this,

02:47:35.251 --> 02:47:37.481
then Dan's got two minutes,
then a 2-minute "C" break.

02:47:37.554 --> 02:47:38.715
<i>I'm gonna stretch my legs.</i>

02:47:41.524 --> 02:47:43.993
We're back in 3...2...

02:47:44.060 --> 02:47:46.290
We'll come back to Jack
Jankowitz later in our show.

02:47:46.362 --> 02:47:47.625
In women's college hoops,

02:47:47.697 --> 02:47:49.597
the Pac-10's been having
a good season

02:47:49.666 --> 02:47:51.191

No.

-- Yes.

Ah, Isaac, is there really an answer I can
give to that question that will satisfy you?

02:48:19.629 --> 02:48:21.563

02:48:33.109 --> 02:48:35.407
Oh, that's ridiculous.

02:48:35.478 --> 02:48:37.003
No, it's not.

02:48:37.080 --> 02:48:39.572
I guess I've been
feeling my age.

02:48:39.649 --> 02:48:41.879
I was rude
to my son-in-law.

02:48:41.951 --> 02:48:44.079
I said
to my daughter Kathy

02:48:44.154 --> 02:48:46.623
that I was too young
to be a grandfather.

02:48:46.689 --> 02:48:48.487
What the hell kind of thing

02:48:48.558 --> 02:48:50.890
is that to say
to your daughter?

02:48:50.960 --> 02:48:52.758
Huh.

02:48:53.830 --> 02:48:54.956
Anyway...

02:48:55.031 --> 02:48:58.763
I'm sorry we fought
this morning.

02:48:58.835 --> 02:49:02.635
In a funny way, Danny and I are
having the same fight right now,

02:49:02.705 --> 02:49:04.833
only he doesn't know
it's about a fight

02:49:04.908 --> 02:49:06.842
that Lisa and I had
five years ago.

02:49:06.910 --> 02:49:08.207
You've never told him,
have you?

02:49:08.278 --> 02:49:10.212
No.

02:49:10.280 --> 02:49:12.442
Why?

02:49:12.515 --> 02:49:14.609
I don't know.

02:49:14.684 --> 02:49:17.585
You got to learn to show people
how you feel about them, Casey.

02:49:17.654 --> 02:49:21.090
-- Why do I have to prove it to him? --
'Cause he feels like a consolation prize.

02:49:21.157 --> 02:49:22.454
He's not.

02:49:22.525 --> 02:49:24.118
Tell him.

02:49:24.194 --> 02:49:26.094
So, you say a few words,

02:49:26.162 --> 02:49:27.652
you make a gesture,

02:49:27.730 --> 02:49:30.290
you remember
an important date.

02:49:30.366 --> 02:49:33.893
Small price to pay
for what you get in return.

02:49:33.970 --> 02:49:37.167
For what you get in return,
it's a steal.

02:49:37.240 --> 02:49:40.141
The rest is all vanity.

-- I was gonna hug you.
-- Oh, please don't.

02:49:53.489 --> 02:49:54.854
As a gesture.

02:49:54.924 --> 02:49:58.622

Okay.

of Mom's disapproval."</i>

"Why Aren't You Married?"

02:50:19.282 --> 02:50:21.717
And "Sports ls No Place
for an Educated Woman"

02:50:21.784 --> 02:50:24.845
and "Didn't Anyone Ever Tell You
How to Cook a Turkey?"

02:50:24.921 --> 02:50:27.049
On the turkey front, she
may have a reasonable point.

02:50:27.123 --> 02:50:29.114
Tell me the mission
of Thespis.

02:50:29.192 --> 02:50:30.523
What's his M.O.?

02:50:30.593 --> 02:50:33.654
By and large, the mission of any
ghost is to offer humility.

02:50:33.730 --> 02:50:36.563
They point out what's important
by mocking what is not.

02:50:36.633 --> 02:50:39.159
I'm not sold.
I'm not sold at all.

we should expect some trouble

[Static]

02:50:56.519 --> 02:50:59.887
Well, that was certainly
uncalled for.

02:50:59.956 --> 02:51:02.550
-- No, I mean it. -- Why
are you looking at me?

02:51:05.695 --> 02:51:07.789
and how long we can expect it
to be going on for.

02:51:07.897 --> 02:51:09.422
How am I bothering Thespis?

02:51:09.499 --> 02:51:12.093
What have I done? What
have I done to this ghost,

02:51:12.168 --> 02:51:14.569
who, by the way, no one
has ever heard of but you?

02:51:14.637 --> 02:51:17.299
What have I done that he should
choose, like Jacob Marley,

02:51:17.373 --> 02:51:19.137
to spend an entire night
in the studio

02:51:19.208 --> 02:51:20.471
just slapping us around?

02:51:20.543 --> 02:51:21.874
You're not bothering Thespis.

02:51:21.945 --> 02:51:25.142
-- I'm obviously bothering Thespis.
-- He's fine.

02:51:25.214 --> 02:51:27.148
It's a power grid upstate. They should
have us back on in a couple minutes.

02:51:27.216 --> 02:51:31.278
I just wanted to make
a nice Thanksgiving dinner.

02:51:31.354 --> 02:51:32.617
Well, not exactly.

02:51:32.689 --> 02:51:34.680
What do you mean,
"not exactly"?

02:51:34.757 --> 02:51:36.191
It's none of my business.

02:51:36.259 --> 02:51:38.353
Well, I'm making it
your business.

02:51:38.428 --> 02:51:40.157
You can't just make it
my business.

02:51:40.229 --> 02:51:42.288
Well, I-| just did.

02:51:42.365 --> 02:51:45.062
You're underestimating
your mother.

02:51:45.134 --> 02:51:47.125
You get to see your family,
what, twice a year?

02:51:47.203 --> 02:51:48.329
Savor it.

02:51:48.404 --> 02:51:51.101
Your mother's gonna love you whether
or not you screw up the turkey.

02:51:51.174 --> 02:51:53.939
My mother's gonna annoy me whether
or not I screw up the turkey.

02:51:54.010 --> 02:51:55.375
Which leads us
to the conclusion

02:51:55.445 --> 02:51:57.607
that your mother loves you
even though she annoys you,

02:51:57.680 --> 02:51:58.943
and it's Thanksgiving,

02:51:59.015 --> 02:52:01.541
so which do you
want to focus on?

02:52:04.087 --> 02:52:06.419
For a guy who's read
"The Hobbit" 14 times,

02:52:06.489 --> 02:52:07.786
you're not so dumb.

02:52:09.826 --> 02:52:12.591
-- Hi.
-- Hey, Casey.

02:52:12.662 --> 02:52:15.461
I was on television for a little while
there, and then I wasn't anymore.

02:52:15.531 --> 02:52:17.829
It's got to be pretty disturbing
for someone like you.

02:52:17.900 --> 02:52:19.459
I think it'd be
pretty disturbing

02:52:19.535 --> 02:52:20.934
for someone like you, too.

02:52:21.004 --> 02:52:22.563

It's a television show, Casey.

02:52:22.638 --> 02:52:26.131
I'm not thinking about
worldly things at the moment.

02:52:26.209 --> 02:52:27.472
Okay.

-- Is anyone?!
-- A power grid's down.

We'll be up in a few minutes.
You should stay at the desk.

poultry falling down? -- Who can say?

way back from the control room, but --

I don't know
if you noticed,

02:52:45.628 --> 02:52:47.357
but I dropped that,
like, 15 minutes ago.

02:52:54.570 --> 02:52:57.301
-- Yeah.
-- They offered it to you?

02:52:57.373 --> 02:52:59.671
There was an offer.
They offered me the show.

02:52:59.742 --> 02:53:01.540
-- And you passed?
-- Yeah.

02:53:01.611 --> 02:53:04.376
-- You passed on your own network show?
-- Yeah.

02:53:05.748 --> 02:53:08.183
-- It was clear we were going national.
-- No, it wasn't.

02:53:08.251 --> 02:53:10.413
Look, I passed on the show.
What does it matter why?
