00:00.497 --> 00:03.247
(birds chirping)

00:18.772 --> 00:21.355
(hammer bangs)

00:22.696 --> 00:25.419
Pin on your diapers,
Charlie, and hit that nail.

00:25.419 --> 00:27.332
(hammer bangs)

00:27.332 --> 00:29.201
(birds chirping)

00:29.201 --> 00:31.000
There you have it, Charlie.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.143
Twin Pines is finally complete.

00:34.140 --> 00:37.963
And one day, all of
this is gonna be yours.

00:41.380 --> 00:42.673
Don't fuck it up.

00:43.634 --> 00:46.384
(birds chirping)

00:58.723 --> 00:59.753
[Man] Fore!

00:59.753 --> 01:02.644
(golf club bangs)

01:02.644 --> 01:05.394
(drink whizzing)

01:16.237 --> 01:19.237
(golf club strikes)

01:20.717 --> 01:23.467
(lighter clicks)

01:27.111 --> 01:30.194
(golf cart whirring)

01:42.117 --> 01:43.700
Hola, Mr. Conroy!

01:45.298 --> 01:47.754
Buenos Dias, Eñejo!

01:47.754 --> 01:50.337
(Eñejo cheers)

01:51.480 --> 01:52.563
Amigo, amigo.

01:55.070 --> 01:56.670
[Fred] Boss, are you here yet?

01:58.340 --> 02:01.322
Son of a bitch!

02:01.322 --> 02:02.155
(Conroy grunts)

02:02.155 --> 02:02.988
What?

02:02.988 --> 02:04.530
[Fred] We need an exterminator.

02:04.530 --> 02:06.000
Just call the cheapest one you can find.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.360
No more than three stars.

02:07.360 --> 02:08.763
[Fred] You also need someone

02:08.763 --> 02:11.430
that will generally run this club,

02:11.430 --> 02:14.780
and not just run it into the ground.

02:14.780 --> 02:16.920
Little harsh for 8:00 a.m. Fred.

02:16.920 --> 02:18.820
[Fred] How's that morning latte, Conroy?

02:18.820 --> 02:21.090
Oh, it was going great
until you fucked it up.

02:21.090 --> 02:24.650
[Fred] So you'll black out
five minutes later than usual?

02:24.650 --> 02:25.970
If I'm lucky.
[Fred] Perfect,

02:25.970 --> 02:28.444
I will update the schedule.

02:28.444 --> 02:31.527
(golf cart whirring)

02:52.708 --> 02:56.069
(phone ringing)

02:56.069 --> 02:57.188
[Jake] Pop, phone.

02:58.724 --> 02:59.702
(phone ringing)

02:59.702 --> 03:01.194
Pop,

03:01.194 --> 03:02.527
phone's ringing.

03:04.410 --> 03:07.010
[Pop] What the hell do I pay you for?

03:07.010 --> 03:08.640
The phone's right behind you, you weirdo.

03:08.640 --> 03:09.473
Just answer it.

03:11.920 --> 03:13.280
[Man On TV] Trust me. She
wants the whole shaft.

03:13.280 --> 03:14.330
Roach Smokers.

03:15.474 --> 03:16.659
Yes, ma'am.

03:16.659 --> 03:18.409
And where is this at?

03:19.630 --> 03:21.363
Twin Pines Country Club.

03:22.570 --> 03:26.357
I'm gonna send my best
man over there right now.

03:27.322 --> 03:28.989
Thank you very much.

03:31.157 --> 03:33.102
You hired someone new?

03:33.102 --> 03:36.745
Would you rather me
lower their expectations?

03:36.745 --> 03:37.618
You could.

03:37.618 --> 03:39.723
Might set a better precedent.

03:39.723 --> 03:43.100
Turn the damn TV off and
get your ass to work.

03:43.100 --> 03:43.933
You want this off?

03:43.933 --> 03:44.766
Helps you sleep.

03:44.766 --> 03:49.270
You relive your glory days
on someone else's time.

03:49.270 --> 03:52.260
The only future you have in golf

03:52.260 --> 03:55.960
is at Twin Pines killing bugs.

03:55.960 --> 03:59.180
Ouch, that was so mean.

03:59.180 --> 04:01.070
Also, I've been hitting the
driving range every Wednesday,

04:01.070 --> 04:01.903
thank you very much.

04:01.903 --> 04:04.070
Oh, does Brandy know about this?

04:04.070 --> 04:05.110
Oh God, no.

04:05.110 --> 04:07.870
Please don't tell her also
that'd be a massive problem.

04:07.870 --> 04:08.703
Get your ass out here and
make me some damn money.

04:08.703 --> 04:09.536
Okay, I love you so much.

04:12.040 --> 04:13.180
Hope you say it back someday.

04:13.180 --> 04:14.363
Yeah, I bet you do.

04:17.639 --> 04:20.722
(car engine revving)

04:22.655 --> 04:25.738
(golf cart whirring)

04:28.566 --> 04:30.037
Oh, not again.

04:30.037 --> 04:33.120
(golf cart whirring)

04:34.960 --> 04:36.773
Ms. Gladys, you okay?

04:37.938 --> 04:39.523
[Gladys] Yeah, I'm fine.

04:40.590 --> 04:41.920
(Gladys belches)

04:41.920 --> 04:43.670
Dehydrated.

04:43.670 --> 04:45.423
I'll send Emily over, stat.

04:46.260 --> 04:49.430
Gladys needs a little assistance
by the ninth hole Tee.

04:49.430 --> 04:50.263
Copy?

04:50.263 --> 04:51.096
Copy that, on my way.

04:53.290 --> 04:56.350
(siren wailing)

04:56.350 --> 04:57.183
10-4.

04:57.183 --> 04:58.963
Emily's gonna bring you beer, Ms. Gladys.

04:59.830 --> 05:01.137
We're good.

05:01.137 --> 05:04.220
(golf cart whirring)

05:14.000 --> 05:15.093
Fuckers.

05:21.998 --> 05:25.081
(golf carts buzzing)

05:29.892 --> 05:31.142
Shane, Jesus!

05:33.428 --> 05:34.845
What's up boss?

05:36.140 --> 05:40.320
Shainski had a big night,
sex with a dude, again.

05:40.320 --> 05:42.830
It's called being experimental, Mikels,

05:42.830 --> 05:45.690
and dude was actually
quite the gentleman...

05:45.690 --> 05:48.350
and pretty fucking sexy.

05:48.350 --> 05:49.183
Told you.

05:49.183 --> 05:50.016
You guys gonna clean this up?

05:51.170 --> 05:52.690
[Shainski] Hey, Linda!

05:52.690 --> 05:53.523
[Shainski] It's raining
men, girl, let's go!

05:53.523 --> 05:54.356
...Let's get some drinks!

05:59.670 --> 06:02.087
(door bangs)

06:05.550 --> 06:07.510
Charlie, we've gotta
get this place together.

06:07.510 --> 06:09.730
Fred, honey, take it easy.

06:09.730 --> 06:11.010
Exterminator's on his way.

06:11.010 --> 06:12.420
Great, see if he'll cut us a deal.

06:12.420 --> 06:13.640
Yeah, how?

06:13.640 --> 06:15.200
Maybe he likes golf.

06:15.200 --> 06:16.940
Dixie Classic tournament...

06:16.940 --> 06:18.180
Ready to lose again?

06:18.180 --> 06:19.750
Won't be difficult.

06:19.750 --> 06:21.140
It's our year to host.

06:21.140 --> 06:22.480
A little patchwork on the greens.

06:22.480 --> 06:24.151
Call it good, and goodbye.

06:24.151 --> 06:25.360
And another thing.

06:25.360 --> 06:26.750
Fred, you are killing my buzz.

06:26.750 --> 06:29.720
Jarvis Boyd is the tournament
director this year,

06:29.720 --> 06:31.640
and you know his
inspections can be a bitch.

06:31.640 --> 06:34.450
He is not gonna give
Charlie Conroy any breaks.

06:34.450 --> 06:36.600
Twin Pines is of course for normal people.

06:36.600 --> 06:37.940
I'll keep it that way.

06:37.940 --> 06:40.250
There's a new rule in the Dixie this year.

06:40.250 --> 06:41.083
Oh, more good news.

06:41.083 --> 06:42.170
Any club that hasn't won

06:42.170 --> 06:44.200
in a 15 year tournament cycle is out.

06:44.200 --> 06:45.600
Spell it out for me, Fred.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.633
We have to win the Dixie Classic.

06:50.550 --> 06:52.740
Or, hear me,

06:52.740 --> 06:54.590
say goodbye to this stupid tradition!

06:55.623 --> 06:57.000
It's a dumb name anyway,

06:57.000 --> 06:57.950
What year is it?

06:57.950 --> 07:00.160
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

07:00.160 --> 07:01.233
[Nick] Morning, everyone!

07:02.390 --> 07:03.393
Connie!

07:05.240 --> 07:06.073
What's shaking?

07:06.073 --> 07:08.380
It's our year to host the Dixie,

07:08.380 --> 07:09.773
you need to get this place in shape.

07:10.790 --> 07:12.410
What was that?

07:12.410 --> 07:13.400
What.

07:13.400 --> 07:14.310
I think I just cut you off.

07:14.310 --> 07:15.620
I wasn't even speaking, Nick.

07:15.620 --> 07:16.883
Oh, oh.

07:18.477 --> 07:20.000
(opens beer)

07:20.000 --> 07:20.850
Good answer.

07:20.850 --> 07:22.200
I have an appointment.

07:22.200 --> 07:23.210
Another online date?

07:23.210 --> 07:26.260
Wrong, I met her on a dating app,

07:26.260 --> 07:27.300
I'm modernizing.

07:27.300 --> 07:30.860
Court your online hussies somewhere else.

07:30.860 --> 07:31.693
Liquor's free here.

07:31.693 --> 07:32.760
No, it's not -

07:32.760 --> 07:34.160
Nick, it's 9:00 a.m.

07:34.160 --> 07:36.340
That's true, it is 9:00 a.m., Conroy.

07:36.340 --> 07:38.903
She better show up sooner or
I'm gonna start without her.

07:39.738 --> 07:41.260
(door squeaks)

07:41.260 --> 07:42.243
[Darcy] Knock, knock.

07:43.570 --> 07:45.010
[Nick] Your breakfast, sir.

07:45.010 --> 07:45.873
Hello?

07:47.180 --> 07:48.140
Shit, she came in the front.

07:48.140 --> 07:49.490
Hey, the tournament -

07:49.490 --> 07:51.130
get this place in shape, huh?

07:51.130 --> 07:52.654
I need you to go out there
and talk to the exterminator.

07:52.654 --> 07:54.072
Is that a...

07:54.072 --> 07:55.373
That's where I cut you off.

07:57.100 --> 07:59.130
Ah, miss Darcy.

07:59.130 --> 08:00.113
Charlie Conroy!

08:08.169 --> 08:10.942
You're the exterminator?

08:10.942 --> 08:11.775
...Yeah.

08:11.775 --> 08:13.290
Yeah! What's your name?

08:13.290 --> 08:14.589
Jake.

08:14.589 --> 08:15.850
Hey Jake, I'm Nick.

08:15.850 --> 08:17.280
Nice to meet you.

08:17.280 --> 08:18.750
Jake, do you ever get in the mind of a bug

08:18.750 --> 08:19.850
when you do your work?

08:21.700 --> 08:23.970
Nah, I usually just kill 'em.

08:23.970 --> 08:24.803
Right.

08:24.803 --> 08:26.300
So what's the damage?

08:26.300 --> 08:28.803
Well, it's roaches which I'm sure you saw.

08:29.640 --> 08:31.730
Some cultures in the
Amazon believe roaches

08:31.730 --> 08:34.133
are premonition of death to the homeowner.

08:35.800 --> 08:37.550
Who do you think's gonna die, Jake?

08:39.350 --> 08:41.290
I mean, I don't really know you guys.

08:41.290 --> 08:42.690
Yeah.

08:42.690 --> 08:45.610
Yeah, I mean, I'll send
the bill soon as possible.

08:45.610 --> 08:46.490
Just in case.

08:46.490 --> 08:48.170
How about club credit?

08:48.170 --> 08:49.003
...Beverages included, of course.

08:49.003 --> 08:49.836
No, no, that's not possible.

08:52.660 --> 08:53.730
All right, well send the bill over,

08:53.730 --> 08:55.370
we'll take care of it, quick.

08:55.370 --> 08:57.330
Yeah, we take any major credit card.

08:57.330 --> 08:59.550
We're just a regular company.

08:59.550 --> 09:02.780
Man, we really like that club
credit thing around here,

09:02.780 --> 09:04.290
but yeah, it's whatever, okay,

09:04.290 --> 09:05.340
what do you gotta do?

09:09.996 --> 09:11.350
All right, how about this?

09:11.350 --> 09:14.960
I'll give you a small
discount for a bucket of balls

09:14.960 --> 09:16.370
at the driving range.

09:16.370 --> 09:17.280
You got a deal.

09:17.280 --> 09:19.530
But no one can find out about this.

09:19.530 --> 09:21.253
Nobody.

09:21.253 --> 09:24.690
If my girl finds out, she will
literally cut my dick off.

09:24.690 --> 09:27.950
Sir, I know secrets men have died for.

09:27.950 --> 09:29.943
Good men, men of honor.

09:32.680 --> 09:33.990
Yeah, whatever, man.

09:33.990 --> 09:35.520
Just don't tell anybody.

09:35.520 --> 09:36.750
I mean, I don't know my name.

09:36.750 --> 09:37.603
I won't tell me.

09:40.393 --> 09:41.793
...You just said it was Nick.

10:17.033 --> 10:20.340
[Nick opens beer]

10:20.340 --> 10:21.840
So she says, come to the hotel

10:21.840 --> 10:23.773
and text me when you get there.

10:24.700 --> 10:26.340
I do.

10:26.340 --> 10:29.640
She says there's this card
key underneath the mat,

10:29.640 --> 10:33.150
the side door, and there was.

10:33.150 --> 10:33.983
Opened the door...

10:33.983 --> 10:36.950
Didn't really know what to
expect, but I saw it right away.

10:36.950 --> 10:39.470
The bathroom would be right
there, but there was a,

10:39.470 --> 10:42.020
like a sheet completely
covering the bathroom door.

10:42.020 --> 10:43.810
But there was a slit in the sheet.

10:43.810 --> 10:46.030
What are you talking about?

10:46.030 --> 10:48.380
[Dogleg] Yes, sir, I'd like
to make a return please.

10:48.380 --> 10:52.460
On an item number A2415.

10:52.460 --> 10:55.040
It's lube on the move.

10:55.040 --> 10:56.230
Yes, sir, I have two of those

10:56.230 --> 10:58.103
and I'd like return them both, please.

10:59.890 --> 11:00.793
There's Dogleg.

11:04.010 --> 11:06.203
Hey also, is this approved by FDA?

11:07.120 --> 11:08.020
No?

11:08.020 --> 11:09.137
So you still don't know
what she looks like?

11:09.137 --> 11:09.970
Not a clue.

11:09.970 --> 11:11.840
[Jake] You guys gotta
keep hanging out, or?

11:11.840 --> 11:13.069
- I hope so, man.

11:13.069 --> 11:13.950
[Jake] Think it'll be something serious?

11:13.950 --> 11:15.623
I doubt it could possibly be.

11:17.790 --> 11:18.785
By the way, it's...

11:18.785 --> 11:19.868
Damn!

11:19.868 --> 11:20.701
Fuck you man.

11:20.701 --> 11:22.180
[Jake] Yeah man, thanks
for letting me do this.

11:22.180 --> 11:24.430
Oh, it's my pleasure.

11:24.430 --> 11:26.540
Thanks for listening to my story.

11:26.540 --> 11:27.490
Mom didn't like it.

11:32.350 --> 11:33.660
Holy shit.

11:33.660 --> 11:34.940
Man, you're pretty good.

11:34.940 --> 11:37.860
I'm gonna come up there
and kick your ass, dude!

11:37.860 --> 11:39.460
Yeah, I used to play.

11:39.460 --> 11:40.700
Used to?

11:40.700 --> 11:42.930
Yeah, girlfriend.

11:42.930 --> 11:44.493
Ah, right.

11:46.250 --> 11:48.530
No, the blow-up-doll was fine.

11:48.530 --> 11:50.980
We just wish it was a girl not a guy.

11:50.980 --> 11:52.750
But it's fine, my wife loves him-

11:52.750 --> 11:54.490
You must have a huge dick!

11:56.120 --> 11:57.690
- Oh, not you sir.

11:57.690 --> 11:58.970
Do we like this guy?

11:58.970 --> 12:00.391
I don't even know that guy.

12:00.391 --> 12:03.127
[Dogleg] I've gotta...

12:03.127 --> 12:05.730
What's the flattest iron
you're having there?

12:05.730 --> 12:07.087
We got a two!

12:07.087 --> 12:07.980
You have a two iron?
[Nick] Oh yeah.

12:07.980 --> 12:09.440
For real?

12:09.440 --> 12:10.797
Wow, look at that.

12:10.797 --> 12:11.630
Get it.

12:11.630 --> 12:12.463
That'll work.

12:12.463 --> 12:14.580
Oh man, I can't wait to see this shit.

12:14.580 --> 12:15.720
What is this, a family heirloom?

12:15.720 --> 12:17.270
Nah, I don't have any family.

12:25.196 --> 12:28.279
(golf ball whistles)

12:29.461 --> 12:30.493
Goddamn dude.

12:32.650 --> 12:33.483
Holy shit.

12:33.483 --> 12:34.316
[Nick] Wow.

12:36.040 --> 12:37.610
I will be right back, sir.

12:37.610 --> 12:38.443
All right.

12:47.050 --> 12:49.630
So, what are the rules on the participants

12:49.630 --> 12:51.260
for the tournament?

12:51.260 --> 12:54.450
Employees and members, even I know that.

12:54.450 --> 12:55.283
...This guy.

12:55.283 --> 12:57.400
You know, we're still looking
for a club for pro, right?

12:57.400 --> 12:59.290
Pro, what happened to Harvey?

12:59.290 --> 13:00.477
Oh, he's dead.

13:00.477 --> 13:01.670
What?

13:01.670 --> 13:03.219
How, when?

13:03.219 --> 13:05.073
A couple years, I have no idea really?

13:06.100 --> 13:07.093
My word.

13:10.060 --> 13:10.996
[Dougleg] Fuck you man.

13:10.996 --> 13:12.282
Damn you.

13:12.282 --> 13:13.449
Ah, fuck dude.

13:14.851 --> 13:16.601
My balls everywhere!

13:17.530 --> 13:18.463
Oh man.

13:19.310 --> 13:20.310
What the heck dude.

13:22.910 --> 13:24.340
Fuck man.

13:24.340 --> 13:26.110
Fuck you, man.

13:26.110 --> 13:26.943
What?

13:26.943 --> 13:28.183
No, I'll call you back.

13:29.440 --> 13:30.350
Good?

13:30.350 --> 13:32.180
[Dogleg] Fuck you!

13:32.180 --> 13:33.130
I can't hear you.

13:34.740 --> 13:35.623
I'm Jake.

13:36.880 --> 13:37.713
Jake!

13:42.032 --> 13:45.115
(golf cart whirring)

13:49.670 --> 13:53.430
Hey, that was pretty
incredible on the range there.

13:53.430 --> 13:55.110
Oh, thanks man.

13:55.110 --> 13:57.780
I'm Charlie Conroy, I own all this.

13:57.780 --> 13:59.090
Oh, Jake Baxter.

13:59.090 --> 14:00.310
Nice to meet you.

14:00.310 --> 14:02.243
How much you make killing bugs, Jake?

14:03.670 --> 14:04.635
Not a ton.

14:04.635 --> 14:05.952
(phone rings)

14:05.952 --> 14:07.640
Oh, go ahead.

14:07.640 --> 14:08.473
What's up, Pop.

14:08.473 --> 14:11.470
Where in the hell have you been?

14:11.470 --> 14:14.770
Janice Wieman has called three times!

14:14.770 --> 14:15.947
I know, yes, I'm on it.

14:15.947 --> 14:16.950
[Pop] You've been outta-

14:16.950 --> 14:19.240
I'm on it Pop.

14:19.240 --> 14:20.073
[Pop] -fuckin around on the golf course -

14:20.073 --> 14:21.380
I'm hanging up.

14:21.380 --> 14:22.880
Goodbye.
[Pop} Piece of shit.

14:22.880 --> 14:23.713
Work for me.

14:25.030 --> 14:25.863
What's that?

14:25.863 --> 14:27.040
I want you to be my golf pro.

14:28.300 --> 14:29.640
You serious?

14:29.640 --> 14:32.000
You got quite a reputation, you know that?

14:32.000 --> 14:33.680
I remember you from your college days.

14:33.680 --> 14:37.350
Oh yeah, my college days.

14:37.350 --> 14:40.100
Criminal, dropout, golf phenom...

14:40.100 --> 14:41.300
You'll fit right in man.

14:42.530 --> 14:43.930
What do you guys even pay?

14:44.870 --> 14:45.703
Double.

14:45.703 --> 14:47.430
Of half your current pay,

14:47.430 --> 14:48.923
10% increase, of course.

14:50.920 --> 14:53.578
Yeah, that's a really shitty deal. Sorry.

14:53.578 --> 14:54.890
Shit's also a fertilizer, Jake,

14:54.890 --> 14:56.470
plus you're an exterminator, so...

14:56.470 --> 14:59.300
You get a raise to have a cool job.

14:59.300 --> 15:01.810
Why don't you show up
tomorrow morning, 9:00 a.m.

15:01.810 --> 15:02.890
Anything else Nick?

15:02.890 --> 15:04.450
Well, I mean you get
free buckets of balls.

15:04.450 --> 15:05.310
The world's yours, buddy.

15:05.310 --> 15:07.380
Yeah, I can't, I'm sorry.

15:07.380 --> 15:10.190
That would be a huge
problem with my girlfriend.

15:10.190 --> 15:12.300
She should be happy if you're happy, Jake.

15:12.300 --> 15:14.510
And if not just dump her ass.

15:14.510 --> 15:18.530
I can't, she's rich and beautiful, so.

15:18.530 --> 15:20.950
I'm sure she's understanding.

15:20.950 --> 15:22.230
And rich and beautiful? No.

15:22.230 --> 15:24.730
How does she feel about
your current employment?

15:25.750 --> 15:29.580
It's literally anything
but golf is allowed.

15:29.580 --> 15:30.413
Really?

15:30.413 --> 15:31.720
That's kind of where I right now.

15:31.720 --> 15:33.080
(phone rings) Jesus.

15:33.080 --> 15:34.460
I'm sorry.

15:34.460 --> 15:36.580
Yes Pop, I'm just finishing up over here.

15:36.580 --> 15:40.073
It's okay Jake, you're fired.

15:43.910 --> 15:44.743
Hello?

15:48.260 --> 15:49.283
I just got fired.

15:58.223 --> 16:00.693
(pat on back)

16:00.693 --> 16:01.900
See you tomorrow morning.

16:01.900 --> 16:02.733
9:00 a.m.

16:06.750 --> 16:07.873
Oh, goddamn it.

16:52.190 --> 16:53.123
[Jarvis] Well gentlemen,

16:54.140 --> 16:56.840
welcome to the quarterly board meeting

16:56.840 --> 16:59.460
of the Magnolia Pointe Country Club.

16:59.460 --> 17:02.350
Our first order of business today

17:02.350 --> 17:07.350
is to revoke the membership
of Mr. Gerald Schilner.

17:07.381 --> 17:11.320
It seems his financials

17:11.320 --> 17:15.100
are not in line with
this club's requirements.

17:15.100 --> 17:17.560
And his car's five years
old for heaven sakes.

17:17.560 --> 17:18.923
[Gary] And it's hunter green.

17:20.090 --> 17:22.327
Poor people, ew. (they all laugh)

17:22.327 --> 17:23.813
[Adrian] Zip it, you twats!

17:26.300 --> 17:27.133
Daddy.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.290
Anything else?

17:29.290 --> 17:31.370
Yeah, I just talked to Darcy Dobbins.

17:31.370 --> 17:34.453
It seems Twin Pines has
hired a new golf pro.

17:35.740 --> 17:36.573
Did they?

17:36.573 --> 17:37.600
[Thomas] Yes, sir, Mr. Boyd.

17:38.810 --> 17:41.533
An exterminator... Jake Baxter.

17:42.900 --> 17:44.367
JAKE BAXTER!?

17:44.367 --> 17:46.579
(man laughs)

17:46.579 --> 17:47.860
Yeah, we are familiar.

17:47.860 --> 17:49.870
He was on my golf team in college.

17:49.870 --> 17:52.050
He got kicked out for selling drugs.

17:52.050 --> 17:53.173
Is he any good?

17:54.020 --> 17:56.010
He beat Adrian a few times.

17:56.010 --> 17:57.500
I was injured.

17:57.500 --> 17:58.933
Okay, then what?

17:58.933 --> 18:01.820
Then he became a loser
exterminator, genius.

18:01.820 --> 18:02.850
Duh.

18:02.850 --> 18:03.953
Not anymore.

18:05.040 --> 18:07.886
Clean your ugly face, ugly person.

18:07.886 --> 18:09.230
Oh burn.

18:09.230 --> 18:10.930
(both laugh)

18:10.930 --> 18:13.050
Fuck you Thomas.
- Fuck you.

18:13.050 --> 18:17.423
So what exactly do we need to
know about this Baxter guy?

18:21.774 --> 18:24.474
I said, what do we need to
know about this Baxter guy?

18:30.117 --> 18:33.200
(car engine roaring)

18:34.039 --> 18:36.789
(rain pattering)

18:54.780 --> 18:55.613
Brandy?

18:57.356 --> 18:58.310
The fuck!

18:58.310 --> 18:59.630
Where have you been?

18:59.630 --> 19:01.910
Fuck it, I was working late.

19:01.910 --> 19:03.420
There's a bunch of bugs-

19:03.420 --> 19:05.070
I'll ask you again.

19:05.070 --> 19:07.560
Where the fuck have you been?

19:07.560 --> 19:08.393
I cooked.

19:08.393 --> 19:09.670
I cheated on you.

19:09.670 --> 19:12.230
I was out having sex with
someone, my secretary.

19:12.230 --> 19:13.460
You don't have a secretary.

19:13.460 --> 19:15.630
A secretary, and she was so hot, too.

19:15.630 --> 19:18.780
And she was a doctor secretary,
and she was a doctor, too.

19:18.780 --> 19:19.613
Son of a bitch.

19:19.613 --> 19:21.010
It was just sticking outta
my pocket, wasn't it?

19:21.010 --> 19:21.930
Classic Baxter.

19:21.930 --> 19:24.130
Pop fired you and now you're playing golf.

19:24.130 --> 19:25.770
Babe, it was just the driving range.

19:25.770 --> 19:26.968
It wasn't even fun.

19:26.968 --> 19:28.654
It was stupid-
Same thing.

19:28.654 --> 19:29.487
Well, it's not the same thing, baby.

19:29.487 --> 19:30.670
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

19:30.670 --> 19:33.220
But I have news, I have really good news.

19:33.220 --> 19:34.290
You ready?

19:34.290 --> 19:35.350
So you know how you've always been saying

19:35.350 --> 19:38.303
I should quit Roach
Smokers, get a real job.

19:38.303 --> 19:40.570
Yeah, but you didn't quit, you got fired.

19:40.570 --> 19:42.790
Yeah, that part took care of itself.

19:42.790 --> 19:45.830
But the cool part is I got a new job.

19:45.830 --> 19:48.070
Who would hire you?

19:48.070 --> 19:49.103
Twin Pines.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.800
Conroy's old club?

19:52.800 --> 19:53.633
Yeah.

19:53.633 --> 19:56.853
And what are you doing at Twin Pines?

19:57.710 --> 19:59.386
I don't know.

19:59.386 --> 20:00.360
We- we didn't really talk about it.

20:00.360 --> 20:01.193
I think I'm the new club pro.

20:01.193 --> 20:02.026
That's it.

20:03.330 --> 20:06.040
Babe, it pays more and it's
something I actually enjoy.

20:06.040 --> 20:07.210
Like we need money.

20:07.210 --> 20:08.970
I'm not gonna keep living
off your dad's money

20:08.970 --> 20:09.930
for the rest of my life.

20:09.930 --> 20:11.390
What the fuck is that?

20:11.390 --> 20:12.230
Is that new?

20:12.230 --> 20:14.091
There's a new man in town.

20:14.091 --> 20:15.250
Good God.

20:15.250 --> 20:20.250
So you just need to get out of my house.

20:21.220 --> 20:22.450
Brandy.
Now.

20:22.450 --> 20:23.820
Fuck!.
Like now.

20:23.820 --> 20:24.653
Are you seriously hitting me?

20:24.653 --> 20:26.228
Like for real.
Okay, Brandy!

20:26.228 --> 20:27.271
Like, get out.

20:27.271 --> 20:29.056
- If I did that to you-
Now, get out.

20:29.056 --> 20:29.889
- It'd be a whole thing on the news.

20:32.127 --> 20:32.960
(banging on door)

20:32.960 --> 20:33.793
Brandy!

20:35.720 --> 20:37.790
Please don't use that thing without me

20:37.790 --> 20:42.575
that will ruin my
confidence, Brandy, please.

20:42.575 --> 20:44.660
(thunder rumbling)

20:44.660 --> 20:46.083
Can I at least have my keys?

20:47.700 --> 20:48.533
Brandy.

20:50.379 --> 20:53.379
(crickets chirping)

21:31.428 --> 21:33.845
(door bangs)

21:35.690 --> 21:36.523
Excuse me.

21:37.450 --> 21:38.550
Sorry.

21:38.550 --> 21:39.553
(Eñejo whispers) Shut the fuck up man!

21:41.110 --> 21:42.903
We're trying to surprise someone.

21:44.190 --> 21:45.561
(Jake whispers) Who are we surprising?

21:45.561 --> 21:46.500
You're still talking?

21:46.500 --> 21:48.053
I'm sorry, man.

21:48.053 --> 21:50.240
Dude, we got a new golf pro.

21:50.240 --> 21:51.073
Just go and spray or whatever you do, bro.

21:51.073 --> 21:51.906
...You're gonna laugh, but I
think I'm the new golf pro.

22:03.647 --> 22:05.388
Unless you hired more than one.

22:05.388 --> 22:06.221
What?

22:06.221 --> 22:07.054
I'm Jake.

22:07.960 --> 22:11.050
I met Conroy yesterday, and Nick.

22:11.050 --> 22:13.320
(yells out) Fucking surprise bro.

22:13.320 --> 22:17.350
Hey Jake! Someone unjammed
the back door, that's awesome.

22:17.350 --> 22:18.183
Whoa.

22:19.020 --> 22:20.470
We love surprises around here.

22:20.470 --> 22:21.303
We just love 'em.

22:21.303 --> 22:22.136
We're not good at 'em but-

22:22.136 --> 22:23.810
No, no, I was surprised.

22:23.810 --> 22:26.000
Yeah, hey, grab some candy if you want.

22:26.000 --> 22:26.833
I'm good for now.

22:26.833 --> 22:27.730
Okay, okay.

22:27.730 --> 22:29.520
Yeah, we already got into that piñata.

22:29.520 --> 22:30.840
I mean it's a piñata, yeah.

22:30.840 --> 22:33.830
Hey, this is the Twin Pines crew.

22:33.830 --> 22:34.770
How's it going everybody?

22:34.770 --> 22:37.257
Yeah, look at that.
Thank you for this.

22:37.257 --> 22:39.150
Jake... uh, Baxter.

22:39.150 --> 22:40.753
Yeah, our head greensman, Eñejo.

22:42.430 --> 22:43.710
Hey, aloha amigo.

22:43.710 --> 22:44.543
Aloha.

22:44.543 --> 22:48.010
Hey, pacha-mama of the
Aztec nation welcomes you.

22:48.010 --> 22:50.720
Yeah, pacha-mama uh back at you.

22:50.720 --> 22:52.253
Tell her, I said hello.

22:53.180 --> 22:55.930
Goes to Peru one week,
changes him forever.

22:55.930 --> 22:56.920
That's where we met actually.

22:56.920 --> 22:58.203
Follow me.

22:58.203 --> 23:00.040
This is Fred, she's our badass bartender.

23:00.040 --> 23:01.560
Fred, is it?
Fred.

23:01.560 --> 23:02.783
As in like...

23:02.783 --> 23:04.035
Fred.

23:04.035 --> 23:05.360
Your name is Fred.

23:05.360 --> 23:06.980
We got Shainski, Mikels.

23:06.980 --> 23:08.490
I would avoid them if you could.

23:08.490 --> 23:10.580
You're late to the party, bro.

23:10.580 --> 23:13.433
That's okay, Jake's running late too.

23:14.830 --> 23:16.240
Are they good?

23:16.240 --> 23:17.640
No, they're not.

23:17.640 --> 23:19.010
All right, here we have Emily.

23:19.010 --> 23:20.940
She drives the beer cart.

23:20.940 --> 23:22.300
And her sister as hot as hell

23:22.300 --> 23:23.810
and doesn't think that I am.

23:23.810 --> 23:25.050
Bummer.
Yeah.

23:25.050 --> 23:26.320
Hi Jake.
How's it going?

23:26.320 --> 23:28.740
Your expertise is a welcome change.

23:28.740 --> 23:31.690
Hopefully you work out better
than the last head pro.

23:31.690 --> 23:32.780
He died.

23:32.780 --> 23:33.970
Yeah.

23:33.970 --> 23:34.810
Did he really die?

23:34.810 --> 23:36.260
Oh yeah, he died real hard.

23:36.260 --> 23:37.100
[Jake] Oh.

23:37.100 --> 23:39.873
Last and very least, we have Dogleg.

23:40.830 --> 23:42.540
He drives the picker cart,
which you demolished,

23:42.540 --> 23:44.200
but he also runs the pro shop

23:44.200 --> 23:45.380
and you could use some new threads.

23:45.380 --> 23:46.680
So go ahead and do your thing Leg.

23:46.680 --> 23:49.740
I say a medium shirt, 32 by 30 pants.

23:49.740 --> 23:52.110
A little loose on the trousers there.

23:52.110 --> 23:53.350
Yeah, actually dead on.

23:53.350 --> 23:56.310
You hit my cart again,
I'll rip those nuts off.

23:56.310 --> 23:57.143
Cool.

23:57.143 --> 23:59.370
Sorry, I didn't know I would
like meet you in person.

23:59.370 --> 24:01.150
Okay, beer.

24:01.150 --> 24:02.740
I'm good, thank you.

24:02.740 --> 24:03.573
Little early, don't you think?

24:03.573 --> 24:05.360
It's like 9:00 a.m.
Okay.

24:05.360 --> 24:07.450
Thank you, thank you for saying that.

24:07.450 --> 24:09.421
I think we started around 7:00, right?

24:09.421 --> 24:10.545
6:00?
6:30.

24:10.545 --> 24:11.517
Maybe 6:30.

24:11.517 --> 24:12.350
El YESTARDA

24:12.350 --> 24:13.500
Enejo hasn't stopped.

24:14.833 --> 24:15.666
Really?

24:15.666 --> 24:16.620
Yeah.

24:16.620 --> 24:20.460
So you guys all just drink
as soon as the day starts.

24:20.460 --> 24:21.423
Welcome to hell.

24:22.500 --> 24:24.650
Right on, cool.

24:24.650 --> 24:27.053
So who's all like running things?

24:31.460 --> 24:32.710
Back to work, everyone!

24:37.230 --> 24:38.063
Gotcha!

24:39.028 --> 24:40.280
We so got him.

24:40.280 --> 24:41.890
Yeah, this place pretty much runs itself.

24:41.890 --> 24:43.130
We're fine.

24:43.130 --> 24:44.189
It does?

24:44.189 --> 24:45.430
Yeah.

24:45.430 --> 24:46.330
I don't know.

24:46.330 --> 24:47.460
I do...

24:47.460 --> 24:48.293
...and you do too.

24:48.293 --> 24:51.170
Hey, let me show you your office.

24:51.170 --> 24:52.003
I have an office.

24:52.003 --> 24:53.840
Fuck yeah, you have an office.

24:53.840 --> 24:54.673
Oh yeah, sure.

24:54.673 --> 24:55.506
Show me the office.

24:55.506 --> 24:56.339
Follow me.
All right.

24:56.339 --> 24:57.720
Excuse me.
Sorry.

24:57.720 --> 24:58.620
Yep, here we go.

25:00.140 --> 25:00.973
Oh, is this it?

25:00.973 --> 25:02.340
Yeah.
Oh, okay.

25:02.340 --> 25:03.173
Yeah.

25:03.173 --> 25:04.006
I thought you said, I got an office.

25:04.006 --> 25:05.130
I don't think I said that.

25:05.130 --> 25:07.120
Now get back there, feel it out.

25:07.120 --> 25:07.953
Sure.

25:07.953 --> 25:09.520
No, yeah, this is nice.

25:09.520 --> 25:10.690
Yeah, it is.

25:10.690 --> 25:13.240
Yeah, this is...
[Nick] A desk.

25:13.240 --> 25:14.350
Yeah, this is plenty.

25:14.350 --> 25:16.290
Agreed, agreed.

25:16.290 --> 25:17.540
Oops.

25:17.540 --> 25:18.390
It's all right.

25:19.490 --> 25:20.323
Oh my God.

25:20.323 --> 25:21.156
That.

25:22.170 --> 25:23.500
Can't waste that.

25:23.500 --> 25:24.333
Yeah.

25:25.590 --> 25:29.620
So just to be clear, what
exactly is my job supposed to be?

25:29.620 --> 25:31.870
You know, go out to
the range and practice,

25:32.920 --> 25:35.600
participate in our annual tournament.

25:35.600 --> 25:37.440
Glad-hand the members and the guests.

25:37.440 --> 25:38.419
Club pro shit.

25:38.419 --> 25:39.490
Wait, I have to play in a tournament?

25:39.490 --> 25:41.180
Yeah, it's not a big deal, it'll be fun.

25:41.180 --> 25:42.410
There's no pressure, we never win.

25:42.410 --> 25:44.590
Okay, I haven't played
golf in like seven years.

25:44.590 --> 25:46.353
Well, I appreciate your modesty.

25:47.235 --> 25:48.513
What is that?

25:48.513 --> 25:49.346
What?

25:49.346 --> 25:50.179
Is that a hickey?

25:51.760 --> 25:52.690
It's definitely not a hickey.

25:52.690 --> 25:54.850
I haven't had a hickey
in a really long time.

25:54.850 --> 25:56.240
You dog, let's get you
outta those clothes.

25:56.240 --> 25:58.400
Is there something on my neck, Nick?

25:58.400 --> 26:00.152
Nick, my neck?

26:00.152 --> 26:02.735
(upbeat music)

26:13.060 --> 26:14.933
All right, so this is
where you'll be schmoozing

26:14.933 --> 26:17.520
with the guests, the
members, the drunk golfers,

26:17.520 --> 26:20.267
giving 'em tips and tricks
and stuff like that.

26:20.267 --> 26:21.470
Let's do a shot.

26:21.470 --> 26:23.047
I'm good, thank you.

26:23.047 --> 26:24.047
All right.

26:28.980 --> 26:30.030
You are spilling that.

26:30.030 --> 26:31.780
All over the bar, sure.

26:31.780 --> 26:32.680
Great.

26:32.680 --> 26:34.300
All right, there you go.

26:34.300 --> 26:36.080
I said no, thank you.

26:36.080 --> 26:36.930
I'll take both.

26:38.280 --> 26:40.320
Jake, I'm sure no one's told you.

26:40.320 --> 26:42.130
So let me be the first.

26:42.130 --> 26:44.450
We're not gonna make it to next quarter.

26:44.450 --> 26:47.740
Fred, easy, it's his first day.

26:47.740 --> 26:48.910
Welcome Jake.

26:48.910 --> 26:50.400
Where's your glass?

26:50.400 --> 26:51.650
I actually don't drink.

26:53.100 --> 26:53.933
What?

26:55.519 --> 26:57.270
If I have one drink, then within the hour,

26:57.270 --> 26:59.840
I'll be out on that
fairway naked smoking meth.

26:59.840 --> 27:02.190
It's like a whole problem,
people will hate me.

27:03.090 --> 27:04.330
People would love you.

27:04.330 --> 27:05.830
Whoa, whoa, whoa, do not try to corrupt

27:05.830 --> 27:06.800
our new golf pro.

27:06.800 --> 27:07.640
The hell is wrong with you two.

27:07.640 --> 27:09.700
Fred is right.

27:09.700 --> 27:12.170
It's actually kind of perfect.

27:12.170 --> 27:13.730
Not only do we need to fix this place up,

27:13.730 --> 27:15.810
but we need to win that prize money.

27:15.810 --> 27:19.160
And if Jake is sober, God help him,

27:19.160 --> 27:20.960
maybe that will improve our chances.

27:22.300 --> 27:23.900
I'm glad you think that's funny.

27:24.970 --> 27:28.180
Now who besides the three of
us here can actually play golf?

27:28.180 --> 27:30.670
Well, we got me.
One.

27:30.670 --> 27:31.790
You.
Two.

27:31.790 --> 27:33.680
There's this guy.
Now three.

27:33.680 --> 27:35.470
Yeah, you're right.

27:35.470 --> 27:36.740
We need one more.

27:36.740 --> 27:38.770
Conroy, we have to win
the tournament this year.

27:38.770 --> 27:40.740
Have we ever won the tournament?

27:40.740 --> 27:41.573
Yeah.

27:42.570 --> 27:43.743
A long time ago.

27:44.610 --> 27:47.120
My dad started the Dixie
when he built this club,

27:47.120 --> 27:48.880
I can't get us kicked out of it.

27:48.880 --> 27:51.580
Besides we need that fucking prize money.

27:51.580 --> 27:53.070
We can do countless things.

27:53.070 --> 27:56.440
We could do like a yard sale of some sort.

27:56.440 --> 27:59.140
We could do a car, like a sexy car wash.

27:59.140 --> 27:59.973
Something, I don't know.

27:59.973 --> 28:01.030
We could strip down and get some--

28:01.030 --> 28:01.934
- I'm not doing a car wash.

28:01.934 --> 28:03.570
I don't know, I'm just riffing.

28:03.570 --> 28:06.060
We lose the tournament, we lose the money,

28:06.060 --> 28:08.500
we lose the club, we lose our jobs.

28:08.500 --> 28:10.150
I'm losing my buzz.

28:10.150 --> 28:10.983
Anyone wanna shot?

28:10.983 --> 28:12.000
Deal me in.
Jake?

28:12.000 --> 28:13.290
No, I'm still sober.

28:13.290 --> 28:17.200
So Conroy, do I have to play
against other like, club pros?

28:17.200 --> 28:18.950
Relax, it's captain's choice.

28:18.950 --> 28:20.330
Best ball wins each stroke.

28:20.330 --> 28:21.467
No, no, that's the whole thing.

28:21.467 --> 28:23.670
That's what I was telling you, I can't.

28:23.670 --> 28:24.980
My girlfriend.

28:24.980 --> 28:27.220
Look, who is this girl?

28:27.220 --> 28:28.393
Why does she hate golf?

28:29.610 --> 28:33.700
Jake, many psychologists
affirm that malicious feelings

28:33.700 --> 28:35.770
toward a significant others' key interest

28:35.770 --> 28:36.603
is very, very toxic.

28:36.603 --> 28:37.436
Psychologists don't
even know my girlfriend.

28:39.570 --> 28:42.710
We're fine, we're in love.

28:42.710 --> 28:45.453
I like her a lot and we're happy.

28:48.610 --> 28:49.960
When I was in college, on the golf team,

28:49.960 --> 28:51.180
I used to get in a lot of trouble

28:51.180 --> 28:54.559
and her whole family kinda hates me.

28:54.559 --> 28:55.392
Yeah.

28:57.240 --> 28:58.820
So shots?

28:58.820 --> 29:00.010
No, I don't drink.

29:00.010 --> 29:01.020
I permanently don't drink.

29:01.020 --> 29:03.060
Okay.
At all.

29:03.060 --> 29:03.893
All right.

29:05.570 --> 29:06.403
I get it.

29:08.126 --> 29:11.209
(classical music)

29:12.700 --> 29:14.920
Well, it's just been a
pleasure to meet you,

29:14.920 --> 29:15.900
Mr. Al-Asmari

29:15.900 --> 29:17.620
Sarah, the pleasure's all mine.

29:17.620 --> 29:19.470
Thank you so much.

29:19.470 --> 29:21.570
Your application has been submitted,

29:21.570 --> 29:23.640
so I hope I get to call
you in a couple of weeks

29:23.640 --> 29:24.530
with the good news.

29:24.530 --> 29:25.640
Well, I'm excited, Sarah.

29:25.640 --> 29:27.970
I've been looking forward to
playing this place a long time.

29:27.970 --> 29:29.660
Oh, it's the my pleasure.

29:29.660 --> 29:31.090
Yes, you have a great day.

29:31.090 --> 29:32.200
I'll see you soon.
Yeah, you too.

29:32.200 --> 29:33.033
Okay.

30:07.040 --> 30:08.310
Relax, Sarah.

30:08.310 --> 30:09.250
Oh, I was--

30:09.250 --> 30:10.940
No, I thought I would just drop by

30:10.940 --> 30:13.310
and see how you were doing.

30:13.310 --> 30:15.506
I am doing fine.

30:15.506 --> 30:19.603
You know that applicant
that was just in here

30:19.603 --> 30:22.200
a little while ago.
Yes.

30:22.200 --> 30:25.200
He seemed a little, what's the word?

30:25.200 --> 30:29.003
Unconventional,
non-traditional, different.

30:31.130 --> 30:31.963
Sure.

30:32.800 --> 30:37.590
All business aside, that
offer for that second drink

30:37.590 --> 30:38.450
still stands.

30:38.450 --> 30:40.200
Oh, yeah.

30:40.200 --> 30:44.790
Oh, you know, I am just really exhausted.

30:44.790 --> 30:46.643
The end of a long day, you know?

30:48.410 --> 30:49.530
But thank you.

30:49.530 --> 30:51.530
We'll take this up at a different time.

30:56.720 --> 30:58.440
All right everybody, listen up.

30:58.440 --> 31:00.040
I got an announcement to make.

31:00.040 --> 31:02.620
We've got the Dixie tournament coming up

31:02.620 --> 31:05.210
and short story shorter, we have to win.

31:05.210 --> 31:07.590
So we are getting our shit together, okay.

31:07.590 --> 31:10.160
The team is gonna be
Jake, Nick and myself,

31:10.160 --> 31:15.160
which means only one of you
needs to learn how to play golf.

31:15.160 --> 31:16.790
Who's the best here at Twin Pines?

31:16.790 --> 31:18.400
Yeah, who sucks the least?

31:18.400 --> 31:19.900
That'd be Shane when he's sober,

31:19.900 --> 31:22.240
but one sip of booze, he's fucked.

31:22.240 --> 31:23.503
Harsh dude.

31:24.660 --> 31:25.493
It's true.

31:26.610 --> 31:29.100
Jake, all I know is that
you gotta beat that douche

31:29.100 --> 31:30.400
at Magnolia Pointe.

31:30.400 --> 31:31.440
Yeah, I am aware.

31:31.440 --> 31:32.290
Thank you, Emily.

31:32.290 --> 31:34.970
Yeah, Adrian Boyd has
not lost in seven years.

31:34.970 --> 31:37.222
Still the biggest douchebag
in seven kingdoms.

31:37.222 --> 31:38.055
Am I?

31:38.055 --> 31:39.450
Is he?

31:39.450 --> 31:40.653
Oh Christ.

31:42.450 --> 31:44.880
Jake fucking Baxter.

31:44.880 --> 31:47.800
I haven't seen you since
you were being a loser,

31:47.800 --> 31:49.970
letting everyone down.

31:49.970 --> 31:52.534
Shouldn't you be somewhere
spraying cockroaches?

31:52.534 --> 31:55.630
(all laugh)

31:55.630 --> 31:57.070
You know this prick?

31:57.070 --> 31:58.880
Yeah, for sure.

31:58.880 --> 32:00.240
Believe it or not, this tiny little boy

32:00.240 --> 32:02.740
is my future brother-in-law, can't wait.

32:02.740 --> 32:06.329
Maybe you people haven't realized this,

32:06.329 --> 32:09.483
but your new golf pro
is a convicted felon,

32:10.660 --> 32:14.625
an alcoholic and a drug addict.

32:14.625 --> 32:16.157
Yeah.

32:16.157 --> 32:16.990
(all cheer) Yeah!

32:17.850 --> 32:18.930
Don't cheer, don't cheer.

32:18.930 --> 32:20.023
I'm sober now, seven years.

32:20.023 --> 32:21.923
I keep telling you guys.
Thank you.

32:22.840 --> 32:25.500
Baxter, you deserve to be in this dump.

32:25.500 --> 32:26.830
Jesus!

32:26.830 --> 32:27.930
What color is your ceiling?

32:27.930 --> 32:28.803
Cancer?

32:30.340 --> 32:32.840
What's with this homeless guy?

32:38.016 --> 32:39.210
(both laugh)

32:39.210 --> 32:40.690
Fuck you.

32:40.690 --> 32:42.000
The fuck do you want?

32:42.000 --> 32:43.820
Just trying to grab some beers, man.

32:43.820 --> 32:45.640
Catch the scenery.

32:45.640 --> 32:48.720
Trying to figure out what
happened to this shithole.

32:48.720 --> 32:51.980
Hey sweetie, how about three beers, stat.

32:51.980 --> 32:53.721
Wow.
How about no.

32:53.721 --> 32:56.560
All right, I'm sorry, but her name's Fred.

32:56.560 --> 32:58.330
Fred?
Yeah.

32:58.330 --> 33:00.650
Oh, I'll call your name out later, baby.

33:00.650 --> 33:02.000
Fred, Fred.

33:02.000 --> 33:03.450
It's a guy's name.

33:03.450 --> 33:04.283
Oh Jesus.

33:05.370 --> 33:07.670
Hey, watch it bro, I'll sue your ass.

33:07.670 --> 33:08.960
Hold me back, man.

33:08.960 --> 33:11.570
Hey man, you're lucky
they're holding me back, bro.

33:11.570 --> 33:13.550
Slow down fucker.

33:13.550 --> 33:14.920
Shitty bar anyway.

33:14.920 --> 33:16.470
I think it's time for you to go.

33:16.470 --> 33:19.020
This place makes my eyes
want to kill themselves.

33:20.240 --> 33:21.073
Let's go.

33:22.550 --> 33:23.383
Wait.

33:24.810 --> 33:26.260
Hey Jake.

33:26.260 --> 33:27.093
What?

33:27.093 --> 33:29.650
Don't you wanna know what
my handicap is these days?

33:30.890 --> 33:32.793
Your personality?
Impotence?

33:33.660 --> 33:34.513
Oh my God.

33:36.750 --> 33:38.193
You think you can beat me.

33:39.965 --> 33:42.291
(they laugh)

33:42.291 --> 33:43.124
Oh my God.

33:45.090 --> 33:46.960
That is so adorable.

33:46.960 --> 33:48.790
I just wanna pinch you.

33:48.790 --> 33:51.517
(both laugh)

33:51.517 --> 33:52.544
I do!

33:52.544 --> 33:54.145
You know what, I do.

33:54.145 --> 33:56.135
It wouldn't be anything new, would it?

33:56.135 --> 33:58.650
That was seven years ago, man.

33:58.650 --> 34:01.600
Conroy, is this little asshole
the only competition we have?

34:01.600 --> 34:04.980
I promise you Baxter, I am a huge asshole.

34:04.980 --> 34:06.320
Huge.

34:06.320 --> 34:07.230
Gaping.

34:07.230 --> 34:09.160
When he poots, it goes whoooo.

34:09.160 --> 34:10.063
Wind tunnel.

34:13.420 --> 34:15.870
Why are you bragging about that?

34:15.870 --> 34:17.090
Watch your shit, Baxter.

34:17.090 --> 34:18.300
Yeah, I'll watch my shit, bro.

34:18.300 --> 34:20.760
I'll watch my shit drop on your face.

34:20.760 --> 34:22.552
Yeah gross, I'm sorry.

34:22.552 --> 34:25.120
I don't usually say stuff like that.

34:25.120 --> 34:26.170
I don't know what to say to that.

34:26.170 --> 34:27.003
Come on.

34:28.520 --> 34:30.330
Later nerds.

34:30.330 --> 34:32.610
Hey guys, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

34:32.610 --> 34:35.023
Wow, fuck.

34:36.052 --> 34:37.862
A bit of a scene, huh?

34:37.862 --> 34:39.917
I'm sorry about that everybody.

34:39.917 --> 34:41.160
I have kind of a history with that guy.

34:41.160 --> 34:42.800
You just gotta externalize him, man.

34:42.800 --> 34:45.020
I mean this whole experience
is a result of our ego.

34:45.020 --> 34:49.340
So just absorb that negativity,
turn it into something good.

34:49.340 --> 34:51.550
After the tournament.
What was that dude?

34:51.550 --> 34:54.173
Was that like special
ops or Navy Seal or what?

34:54.173 --> 34:55.920
I was mall security for a while.

34:55.920 --> 34:56.753
Can I get a shot, please?

34:56.753 --> 34:57.586
[Dogleg] Dangerous mall.

34:57.586 --> 34:58.419
Yeah, you actually deserve this one.

34:59.926 --> 35:01.010
Hey, you know what, can I borrow that club

35:01.010 --> 35:02.010
up there real quick?

35:03.170 --> 35:04.013
I got an idea.

35:04.930 --> 35:07.130
Go ahead.
Perfect.

35:07.130 --> 35:09.946
Can you come with me
though just 'cause you can,

35:09.946 --> 35:12.113
that kick that you can do.

35:19.630 --> 35:22.010
Those chicks upstairs were
jocking you so hard, bro.

35:22.010 --> 35:23.110
Of course they were.

35:26.254 --> 35:27.087
Get in the car.

35:31.860 --> 35:33.303
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

35:35.420 --> 35:36.930
There's no fucking way
I'm letting that guy

35:36.930 --> 35:37.920
steal my thunder.

35:37.920 --> 35:38.950
Oh hell no.

35:38.950 --> 35:41.140
Your thunder is so unstealable A. money.

35:41.140 --> 35:41.973
Right?

35:43.890 --> 35:44.723
[All] Yeah.

35:45.765 --> 35:46.598
Oh Jesus Christ.

35:46.598 --> 35:47.620
Are you okay?

35:47.620 --> 35:49.120
I don't know, you guys okay?

35:50.500 --> 35:51.333
Fore.

35:54.370 --> 35:55.870
Nobody fucks with Seabiscuit!

35:58.427 --> 36:00.308
Oh, he's coming, man.

36:00.308 --> 36:01.358
Get in the car man.

36:02.645 --> 36:04.762
Go, go, go, man.

36:04.762 --> 36:06.524
See you in court!

36:06.524 --> 36:07.524
Take care.

36:16.660 --> 36:17.833
Oh my God, man.

36:20.040 --> 36:21.140
This place rules, man.

36:22.530 --> 36:25.690
Jake, I cannot wait to see how
you perform in competition.

36:25.690 --> 36:26.540
Yeah, me too.

36:26.540 --> 36:27.610
See how it goes.

36:27.610 --> 36:29.110
So what happened in college?

36:30.560 --> 36:33.043
Yeah, yeah, that was kind of an ordeal.

36:34.500 --> 36:39.500
10 hookers from just
like the yellow pages.

36:39.530 --> 36:42.440
I think that was the worst
part, was the hookers.

36:42.440 --> 36:46.230
But then also a pound of
weed, half a gallon of jack.

36:46.230 --> 36:51.230
133 beers, I think they
counted, and ounce of coke.

36:51.780 --> 36:54.460
And then some molly and then
some guy brought ketamine.

36:54.460 --> 36:56.290
I had never done ketamine.

36:56.290 --> 37:00.610
So we did that and then poppers
and then half a tab of acid.

37:00.610 --> 37:02.670
This is after I won state junior year.

37:02.670 --> 37:04.650
That sounds like a great week.

37:04.650 --> 37:05.650
This was one night.

37:07.070 --> 37:08.830
How'd she find out?

37:08.830 --> 37:10.210
That was my fault.

37:10.210 --> 37:14.290
I invited her into bed
with us and then she knew

37:15.180 --> 37:16.940
right then and there.

37:16.940 --> 37:19.720
And how is she handling all this?

37:19.720 --> 37:21.290
Not great.

37:21.290 --> 37:22.950
She locked me out last night.

37:22.950 --> 37:24.100
I slept in the rain.

37:24.100 --> 37:26.860
So that's couple stuff.

37:26.860 --> 37:27.693
You're together seven years,

37:27.693 --> 37:30.730
you kinda, you sleep
in the rain sometimes.

37:30.730 --> 37:32.390
We'll talk about it at dinner.

37:32.390 --> 37:35.030
So back to this whole you not playing golf

37:35.030 --> 37:36.750
for the last seven years.

37:36.750 --> 37:41.050
Can we get you back out for
another round or five tomorrow.

37:41.050 --> 37:43.690
And then every other day
leading up to the tournament?

37:43.690 --> 37:46.180
We've got two weeks to practice.

37:46.180 --> 37:48.720
Jake, historically, we've
not had the best relationship

37:48.720 --> 37:50.900
with the members at Magnolia Pointe.

37:50.900 --> 37:52.023
Or the management.

37:52.890 --> 37:54.403
Boss fucked Jarvis's wife.

37:56.170 --> 37:57.460
His ex-wife.

37:57.460 --> 37:58.690
Because you fucked her.

37:58.690 --> 38:00.720
You fucked Jarvis's wife?

38:00.720 --> 38:01.890
Oh my God, dude.

38:01.890 --> 38:03.390
Is that why they got divorced?

38:04.727 --> 38:06.400
You know the rumors
that he's in the closet

38:06.400 --> 38:07.970
and that's why they got divorced.

38:07.970 --> 38:10.040
Oh, he's deep in the closet.

38:10.040 --> 38:12.330
Damn dude, that's cool.

38:12.330 --> 38:14.390
I think that's really cool.

38:14.390 --> 38:15.630
Sick dude.

38:15.630 --> 38:17.580
How's Adrian's game looking these days?

38:23.960 --> 38:26.093
I said how's Adrian's game these days?

39:17.420 --> 39:19.391
Let me get this for you, sir.

39:19.391 --> 39:20.442
You got a little something on your shirt.

39:20.442 --> 39:21.315
What?

39:21.315 --> 39:22.148
Something on your shirt.

39:22.148 --> 39:22.981
- hat the hell?

39:22.981 --> 39:23.814
What is this?

39:23.814 --> 39:24.647
Did you do this?

39:24.647 --> 39:25.547
I did not.

39:25.547 --> 39:27.770
Get the hell out, you're fired.

39:27.770 --> 39:29.253
Oh right.
Get outta here.

39:41.870 --> 39:43.390
Night fellas.

39:43.390 --> 39:44.870
See you later, man.

39:44.870 --> 39:46.030
Good first day, Jake.

39:46.030 --> 39:47.350
Thank you, sir.

39:47.350 --> 39:48.183
You good to drive?

39:48.183 --> 39:49.420
Yeah, I got my license.

39:51.691 --> 39:54.774
(car engine revving)

40:08.616 --> 40:11.366
(car door thuds)

40:30.352 --> 40:31.185
Hey!

40:34.300 --> 40:35.133
Hey.

40:36.010 --> 40:37.170
You live there?

40:37.170 --> 40:38.003
Yeah.

40:41.870 --> 40:43.483
Why do you drive?

40:44.993 --> 40:47.503
Well, I was over there, but I live here.

40:51.180 --> 40:52.013
Fair enough.

41:00.790 --> 41:01.623
Oof.

41:09.548 --> 41:11.965
(door thuds)

41:17.100 --> 41:19.010
Hey honey.

41:19.010 --> 41:20.503
Hey gummy bear.

41:22.050 --> 41:23.313
How was your first day?

41:24.756 --> 41:27.413
Ah, it was whatever.

41:28.410 --> 41:30.378
You know, it's one of those...

41:30.378 --> 41:31.211
Not great, huh?

41:31.211 --> 41:32.044
I guess you're just stuck with it.

41:35.330 --> 41:36.163
Yeah.

41:36.163 --> 41:38.130
Can't go back to Roach Smokers.

41:38.130 --> 41:40.970
I can't, it's so stupid, it sucks.

41:40.970 --> 41:43.280
I have to like golf now.

41:43.280 --> 41:44.113
Fuck.

41:44.113 --> 41:48.520
If you quit, you have sex again.

41:48.520 --> 41:49.753
Man, yes.

41:51.051 --> 41:53.093
Kind of starting to forget
what that feels like.

41:54.753 --> 41:56.900
Is that something we
could maybe discuss, or?

41:56.900 --> 41:58.223
I don't think so.

41:59.740 --> 42:00.573
Still no.

42:01.750 --> 42:02.623
That's fair.

42:04.790 --> 42:06.370
What's for dinner?

42:06.370 --> 42:11.370
We have a roasted bird with
brown rice and asparagus.

42:13.810 --> 42:14.643
Sounds good.

42:57.100 --> 42:57.933
Nope.

43:01.520 --> 43:03.153
Jesus Christ Brandy.

43:04.210 --> 43:05.530
You're torturing me at this point.

43:05.530 --> 43:07.778
You don't have to wear that to bed.

43:07.778 --> 43:12.778
It's just comfy.

43:21.148 --> 43:23.898
(Brandy moaning)

43:31.285 --> 43:32.452
Fucking God.

43:34.547 --> 43:35.987
Brandy, I need you.

43:35.987 --> 43:38.300
Then you need to find another job.

43:38.300 --> 43:40.670
Brandy, you can't keep blaming golf

43:40.670 --> 43:43.740
for all the things that
happened to us in college.

43:43.740 --> 43:45.410
I'm sorry us.

43:45.410 --> 43:47.450
And by that, do you mean
the hookers and drugs?

43:47.450 --> 43:48.550
That we did?

43:48.550 --> 43:50.520
Oh my God, here we go.

43:50.520 --> 43:54.200
If I can't blame golf
then who can I blame?

43:54.200 --> 43:56.900
Everything's been fine since
then and now look at you.

43:59.130 --> 44:02.553
No sex because golf.

44:07.023 --> 44:07.856
Fine.

44:09.947 --> 44:12.697
(Brandy moaning)

44:21.859 --> 44:22.692
Whatever.

44:22.692 --> 44:23.525
(porn music starts)

44:25.191 --> 44:27.524
(both moan)

44:31.955 --> 44:32.788
Oh yeah.

44:34.743 --> 44:35.576
Wow.

44:37.592 --> 44:39.131
Oh, yeah!

44:39.131 --> 44:41.411
Oh, this is better.

44:41.411 --> 44:43.870
I like this better!

44:43.870 --> 44:46.350
All right folks, balls teed up!

44:46.350 --> 44:47.723
Tee up those balls.

44:49.002 --> 44:51.835
(golf club bangs, misses)

44:54.430 --> 44:55.750
Fred, keep your head down.

44:55.750 --> 44:57.930
Dogleg, I would say probably just no,

44:57.930 --> 44:59.540
you can probably go pick up those balls.

44:59.540 --> 45:01.340
Gladys, I noticed a slice.

45:01.340 --> 45:03.250
Shainski, I know you
wanna have a wide stance

45:03.250 --> 45:05.350
'cause you're so drunk
and it's hard to stand up.

45:05.350 --> 45:06.340
But if you narrow that stance,

45:06.340 --> 45:08.960
you can get more rotation
through the hips, all right?

45:08.960 --> 45:11.080
Mikels bend those knees,
tighten up a little bit,

45:11.080 --> 45:12.090
but stay relaxed.

45:12.090 --> 45:15.720
Eñejo, are those gardening gloves?

45:15.720 --> 45:17.030
Emily, that was fucking hot.

45:17.030 --> 45:19.001
That was good, the swing was good.

45:19.001 --> 45:20.760
I've been working here for five years.

45:20.760 --> 45:22.023
I don't know what they've been doing.

45:22.023 --> 45:24.090
Okay everyone, if your
ball did not go past

45:24.090 --> 45:26.720
the 100 yard marker, you
have officially been cut.

45:26.720 --> 45:29.030
But don't get it twisted,
you have not been cut off.

45:29.030 --> 45:30.380
Go ahead and feel free
to make your way back

45:30.380 --> 45:32.780
to the clubhouse, put some
liquids into your face holes.

45:32.780 --> 45:33.820
Have fun.

45:33.820 --> 45:34.970
Yeah.

45:34.970 --> 45:37.603
Hey you two, threesome?

45:39.645 --> 45:40.478
Come on.

45:40.478 --> 45:41.610
Hey, wait for me Gladys.

46:06.400 --> 46:07.860
Oh shit snake, man.

46:07.860 --> 46:09.513
Snake!

46:09.513 --> 46:11.620
(Mikels laughs)

46:11.620 --> 46:13.123
Meet Sir Hissyfit.

46:14.730 --> 46:17.033
Oh, come on Shainski, it was a joke, bro.

46:18.440 --> 46:20.883
I got it all on video,
I'm posting right now.

46:22.240 --> 46:23.903
[Gladys] You fucking pussy.

46:26.062 --> 46:28.479
(man laughs)

46:31.089 --> 46:33.589
(phone rings)

46:34.865 --> 46:35.698
Hi.

46:35.698 --> 46:36.531
Hey, what are you doing?

46:36.531 --> 46:38.023
Just working away.

46:38.910 --> 46:40.010
Looking at Match Strike?

46:40.010 --> 46:40.870
Yeah, okay.

46:40.870 --> 46:42.810
Fine, yeah, I am.

46:42.810 --> 46:44.660
But unsuccessfully.

46:44.660 --> 46:45.760
You'll find someone.

46:46.953 --> 46:49.673
Hmm, sexy mama.

46:51.120 --> 46:54.373
How about,

46:55.500 --> 46:58.300
a drink?

46:58.300 --> 47:01.080
(phone chimes)

47:01.080 --> 47:04.400
Yeah, someone equally
as desperate as I am.

47:04.400 --> 47:06.460
Charlie Conroy just messaged me.

47:06.460 --> 47:08.690
That crazy guy that owns Twin Pines?

47:08.690 --> 47:10.640
I haven't even said one word to this guy

47:10.640 --> 47:14.040
and he wants to meet for a drink.

47:14.040 --> 47:15.530
He's desperate.

47:15.530 --> 47:17.150
You're desperate too.

47:17.150 --> 47:18.150
Talk to you later.

47:20.510 --> 47:21.343
Hi.

47:22.760 --> 47:24.827
How are you, Charlie?

47:24.827 --> 47:27.290
(phone chiming)

47:27.290 --> 47:32.290
Much better now that I
am looking at your...

47:34.764 --> 47:36.413
(phone chimes)

47:36.413 --> 47:39.163
(Sarah chuckles)

47:41.020 --> 47:44.463
How about dinner?

47:47.940 --> 47:48.903
I think so.

47:52.080 --> 47:54.310
I'll hold off on that.

47:54.310 --> 47:57.420
A cocktail and a bite.

47:57.420 --> 48:02.420
No strings attached.

48:02.449 --> 48:05.032
(phone chimes)

48:09.960 --> 48:12.270
Your putt looks like shit dude.

48:12.270 --> 48:13.250
Yeah.

48:13.250 --> 48:14.700
Got any pointers?

48:14.700 --> 48:16.050
See, your mechanics are off.

48:16.050 --> 48:16.883
Let's see.

48:23.470 --> 48:24.920
Discomfort in your right hip.

48:25.780 --> 48:26.860
Yeah, how'd you know?

48:26.860 --> 48:28.180
I mean it's pretty fucking obvious.

48:28.180 --> 48:29.270
Putting all your weight on the left side.

48:29.270 --> 48:30.310
You're overcompensating.

48:30.310 --> 48:31.877
I've been to like a thousand
doctor since college

48:31.877 --> 48:33.650
and no one can diagnose it.

48:33.650 --> 48:35.300
I can help you.

48:35.300 --> 48:36.681
Can you?
Oh yeah.

48:36.681 --> 48:37.514
How.

48:37.514 --> 48:38.870
Huachuma ceremony.

48:38.870 --> 48:39.703
Pardon?

48:39.703 --> 48:42.590
It's an ancient shamanic
medicine from the sacred cactus.

48:42.590 --> 48:43.893
Also known as San Pedro.

48:45.290 --> 48:47.313
Nick, are you a shaman?

48:47.313 --> 48:49.040
Oh God, no.

48:49.040 --> 48:52.580
For we are all our own shaman, Jake.

48:52.580 --> 48:53.413
Oh we are?

48:53.413 --> 48:54.246
The medicine will teach you.

48:54.246 --> 48:56.650
It'll show you where the pain
is so you can extract it.

48:56.650 --> 48:59.200
The grandfather is very wise.

48:59.200 --> 49:00.033
Your grandfather?

49:00.033 --> 49:01.580
No, no, no, he's an idiot.

49:01.580 --> 49:03.990
The cactus, grandfather Huachuma.

49:03.990 --> 49:05.990
Cut and cooked right here at Twin Pines.

49:07.230 --> 49:08.560
Really?

49:08.560 --> 49:09.393
Oh yeah.

49:09.393 --> 49:10.226
(island music)

49:12.520 --> 49:15.663
So how long have you been on Match Strike?

49:15.663 --> 49:18.841
It was my daughter's idea, I just...

49:18.841 --> 49:20.250
Can I get you anything to drink?

49:20.250 --> 49:21.390
A cocktail?

49:21.390 --> 49:23.610
No thank you, just water for me.

49:23.610 --> 49:24.830
Two martinis.

49:24.830 --> 49:27.380
No, no, just one, I'm not drinking.

49:27.380 --> 49:28.237
They're for me.

49:29.320 --> 49:32.413
I took a nap, I just gotta
get back up to speed.

49:36.690 --> 49:38.220
Oh shit.

49:38.220 --> 49:39.610
Now what?

49:39.610 --> 49:40.443
That's my boss, he
comes here all the time.

49:40.443 --> 49:41.276
Well, no worries, let's chat with him.

49:43.300 --> 49:45.160
Oh this fucking dickhead?

49:45.160 --> 49:47.430
Sarah, you look beautiful.

49:47.430 --> 49:49.033
Thank you.

49:49.033 --> 49:50.834
Charlie Conroy.

49:50.834 --> 49:52.610
Are you sober tonight, Charlie?

49:52.610 --> 49:55.340
Dickhead, Jarvis.

49:55.340 --> 49:57.460
I know you're gonna date
other men, that's fine.

49:57.460 --> 50:01.740
But this individual just
is not in your class.

50:01.740 --> 50:02.730
The fuck did you just say?

50:02.730 --> 50:04.090
Hey, watch your language.

50:04.090 --> 50:05.900
This is not Twin Pines.

50:05.900 --> 50:08.050
You're gonna apologize
after I've taken my foot

50:08.050 --> 50:09.023
outta your asshole.

50:11.140 --> 50:13.563
You're right, I'm sorry.

50:14.450 --> 50:17.620
I'm sorry, Conroy, that
you're such a loser.

50:17.620 --> 50:19.990
Your daddy would be so ashamed of you.

50:19.990 --> 50:22.550
Yeah, care put a little wager on that?

50:22.550 --> 50:25.310
I would, but I don't
think you can afford it.

50:25.310 --> 50:27.480
I'll bet you 25 grand on the Dixie

50:27.480 --> 50:29.440
that I've got better golfers and people

50:29.440 --> 50:31.530
than all those pricks at Magnolia Pointe.

50:31.530 --> 50:34.640
I don't care what type of
shape Twin Pines is in.

50:34.640 --> 50:35.800
We know that for a fact.

50:35.800 --> 50:38.040
We have more integrity
in one blade of grass

50:38.040 --> 50:39.910
than you've got in that
whole generic piece of shit

50:39.910 --> 50:41.210
club of yours.

50:41.210 --> 50:44.400
Well, let's put up a little wager.

50:44.400 --> 50:45.743
Let's put up our clubs.

50:47.070 --> 50:50.210
You'd put your club up
in a bet against me?

50:50.210 --> 50:51.790
This is childish.

50:51.790 --> 50:53.100
Name the terms.

50:53.100 --> 50:54.330
Oh simple.

50:54.330 --> 50:56.160
My club against your club.

50:56.160 --> 50:57.163
Winner take all.

50:58.246 --> 50:59.730
Bet your life.

50:59.730 --> 51:00.863
You bet yours.

51:06.770 --> 51:07.603
Charlie!

51:10.310 --> 51:11.753
Oh, you faker, look at this.

51:11.753 --> 51:14.010
He's trying to back out the bet.

51:14.010 --> 51:15.310
Someone call an ambulance!

51:15.310 --> 51:16.880
I think is having a heart attack.

51:16.880 --> 51:19.521
I'll see you at work, Sarah.

51:19.521 --> 51:20.354
It's okay.

51:20.354 --> 51:22.110
(ambulance siren wailing)

51:22.110 --> 51:24.470
Hey, can you grab me a bottle of whiskey?

51:24.470 --> 51:26.840
Nope, but I'll have something
better for you on the ride.

51:26.840 --> 51:27.673
My man.

51:30.330 --> 51:31.960
He was just talking to someone

51:31.960 --> 51:33.940
and then he grabbed at his chest

51:33.940 --> 51:38.600
and I've seen a heart
attack before, so yeah.

51:38.600 --> 51:39.470
Well thank you, ma'am.

51:39.470 --> 51:41.443
Would you like to ride with your husband?

51:42.983 --> 51:44.780
I'll meet him there later.

51:44.780 --> 51:45.613
He should be okay.

51:45.613 --> 51:46.590
Good thing he has you.

51:49.537 --> 51:52.787
(ambulance door thuds)

51:57.143 --> 52:00.726
(ambulance sirens wailing)

52:11.864 --> 52:15.450
Good morning, Charles, I'm Dr. Lloyd.

52:15.450 --> 52:16.550
How you feeling buddy?

52:17.460 --> 52:18.490
I've been better.

52:18.490 --> 52:19.950
Well, you're pretty lucky that your friend

52:19.950 --> 52:23.450
knew what was going on,
because you have suffered

52:23.450 --> 52:25.447
a mild heart attack.

52:25.447 --> 52:28.070
Yeah, I've been lucky
doc and this ain't it.

52:28.070 --> 52:30.623
How many drinks a week
would you say you consume?

52:31.770 --> 52:32.853
Not that many.

52:33.820 --> 52:35.400
Well, according to your chart,

52:35.400 --> 52:40.320
your blood alcohol level is
currently 0.21, that's high.

52:40.320 --> 52:41.240
Is it?

52:41.240 --> 52:43.330
That's after eight hours.

52:43.330 --> 52:45.970
Yeah, that's a little bit high.

52:45.970 --> 52:48.200
So we'd really like to
keep you one more night,

52:48.200 --> 52:50.710
send you to the cath lab in the
morning and run a few tests.

52:50.710 --> 52:51.830
What do you think?

52:51.830 --> 52:53.400
Yeah, sure.

52:53.400 --> 52:57.570
But Charles I highly
recommend some extreme

52:57.570 --> 52:58.953
lifestyle changes.

52:59.790 --> 53:02.003
Okay, so what are we talking about?

53:03.040 --> 53:04.133
Get sober.

53:06.090 --> 53:07.390
That's a little drastic.

53:08.240 --> 53:11.350
I'll be back in a couple
hours of check on you, buddy.

53:11.350 --> 53:12.183
All right.

53:22.290 --> 53:24.150
Dammit, Conroy.

53:24.150 --> 53:24.983
Enough, just talk to me.

53:24.983 --> 53:25.816
All right.

53:28.020 --> 53:29.270
Well, if you don't get well soon,

53:29.270 --> 53:31.020
you're gonna lose everything you have.

53:31.020 --> 53:33.350
Also, Nick's looking for a job.

53:33.350 --> 53:35.780
Jake's actually really good for the place.

53:35.780 --> 53:37.560
And he likes it here.

53:37.560 --> 53:38.560
Do they know about me yet?

53:38.560 --> 53:39.980
Yeah, they wanna come see you.

53:39.980 --> 53:41.990
No and don't tell anyone else.

53:41.990 --> 53:43.340
If I'm gonna play in the
Dixie, I'm gonna get-

53:43.340 --> 53:45.560
Well, if you wanna plan the Dixie,

53:45.560 --> 53:47.350
do you think you should?

53:47.350 --> 53:48.183
Yeah.

53:48.183 --> 53:49.016
But Conroy, you just-

53:49.016 --> 53:51.350
Dammit Fred, I should be dead right now

53:51.350 --> 53:55.640
and the only person that has
come to see me is my bartender.

53:55.640 --> 53:57.781
Where all the friends I used to have?

53:57.781 --> 53:59.673
What friends?

53:59.673 --> 54:00.823
I don't fucking know.

54:02.750 --> 54:03.583
I got no one.

54:04.850 --> 54:09.493
My dad built Twin Pines
and I can't lose it.

54:10.580 --> 54:12.190
Don't worry about the club, okay.

54:12.190 --> 54:13.490
We'll figure all that out.

54:15.180 --> 54:17.180
When do we get you back then?

54:17.180 --> 54:18.680
They'll let me out tomorrow.

54:20.200 --> 54:21.650
Did you bring my phone?

54:21.650 --> 54:22.623
Of course.

54:24.610 --> 54:26.830
You're gonna look at
porn in this, aren't you?

54:26.830 --> 54:28.170
Yes.

54:28.170 --> 54:29.120
Get well, Conroy.

54:30.090 --> 54:30.923
Grandma goes wild... hmmm.

54:30.923 --> 54:31.756
(quirky music plays)

54:43.562 --> 54:45.979
(door thuds)

54:47.857 --> 54:50.940
(golf cart whirring)

54:53.996 --> 54:55.080
Oh morning buddy.

54:55.080 --> 54:56.180
Everything's great.

54:56.180 --> 54:57.994
That's close.
Okay.

54:57.994 --> 54:59.606
Complimentary club day.

54:59.606 --> 55:00.772
Hey, what are you doing?

55:00.772 --> 55:01.605
Have a good round.

55:01.605 --> 55:03.120
Hey, listen, we need to find
a replacement for Conroy

55:03.120 --> 55:03.970
in the tournament.

55:03.970 --> 55:05.230
We need to fix your putt.

55:05.230 --> 55:06.270
No, we don't need to
fix, my putt's good man.

55:06.270 --> 55:08.420
Well we do, we need to
drink the juice too.

55:08.420 --> 55:10.090
The cactus juice.
I'm not drinking the juice.

55:10.090 --> 55:11.130
Conroy just had a heart attack.

55:11.130 --> 55:12.201
We gotta drink the cactus, Jakey Bear!

55:12.201 --> 55:13.570
Just get in the cart,
you're freaking people out.

55:13.570 --> 55:15.070
I'm not drinking the cactus, man.

55:15.070 --> 55:16.060
We're not doing hallucinogenics.

55:16.060 --> 55:18.130
Channel your energy into fixing your hip

55:18.130 --> 55:19.474
and to healing Conroy's heart.

55:19.474 --> 55:20.307
We'll figure it out, just get outta here.

55:20.307 --> 55:22.770
Sorry dude, I think
you pretty much got it.

55:22.770 --> 55:24.102
Nothing I can really
tell you about putting.

55:24.102 --> 55:24.935
You just gotta aim for the hole!

55:24.935 --> 55:25.768
You were doing it, just continue to do it!

55:25.768 --> 55:26.601
(tribal music)

55:29.628 --> 55:32.711
(golf cart whirring)

55:53.723 --> 55:55.603
Hola brother, Jake.

55:57.020 --> 55:58.490
How's it going Eñejo?

55:58.490 --> 56:00.200
Pacha-mama welcomes you here today.

56:00.200 --> 56:02.410
I bet she does, what is this?

56:02.410 --> 56:05.420
This is Twin Pine source
of spiritual energy, Jake.

56:05.420 --> 56:08.290
It's also a very viable source
of supplementary income.

56:08.290 --> 56:09.670
Formally the 10th fairway.

56:09.670 --> 56:10.817
What do you mean supplementary income?

56:10.817 --> 56:12.140
Oh, we sell them on the internet.

56:12.140 --> 56:13.490
It's a house plant.

56:13.490 --> 56:14.690
Oh my God, seriously?

56:14.690 --> 56:15.670
Yeah.

56:15.670 --> 56:18.410
Myself and Eñejo will be back shortly.

56:18.410 --> 56:19.523
Reset your mind.

56:20.360 --> 56:23.270
Put into focus what you'd
like to work on today.

56:23.270 --> 56:24.680
I was working on my putt, I thought.

56:24.680 --> 56:26.370
Okay, that's exactly what we're doing.

56:26.370 --> 56:29.670
Except we're going to
be doing it with your...

56:29.670 --> 56:30.503
My hat.

56:30.503 --> 56:31.350
Your...

56:32.252 --> 56:33.085
Oh, my memory.

56:33.085 --> 56:34.375
Your ma...

56:34.375 --> 56:35.208
Mom.

56:35.208 --> 56:37.240
Not your mom, no, your m- mi-

56:37.240 --> 56:38.210
Oh my mind?

56:38.210 --> 56:39.640
Mind.
Oh fuck.

56:39.640 --> 56:40.720
Yeah, sure.

56:40.720 --> 56:41.553
Why didn't you just say that?

56:41.553 --> 56:42.386
I don't know.

56:42.386 --> 56:43.219
But we'll see you soon.

56:49.070 --> 56:49.903
Fuck.

57:03.320 --> 57:04.153
Oh man.

57:07.150 --> 57:08.210
Is this like a whole weird thing?

57:08.210 --> 57:10.060
I'm not gonna do a whole weird thing.

57:11.010 --> 57:12.870
I don't wanna be culturally insensitive.

57:12.870 --> 57:16.050
Friends today, we connect
with the ancient ones.

57:16.050 --> 57:19.423
Not by looking up, but by looking in.

57:20.460 --> 57:25.063
We will be extracting our
past and healing our present.

57:27.120 --> 57:30.460
One thing we must remember
in is that there is no past,

57:30.460 --> 57:31.633
there is no future.

57:32.510 --> 57:33.543
There is only now.

57:35.800 --> 57:39.053
Now is forever, and now is never.

57:40.380 --> 57:43.550
Jake, you're experiencing
some blockage in your hip.

57:43.550 --> 57:47.400
Your right hip.

57:47.400 --> 57:49.090
This is my right hip.

57:49.090 --> 57:50.630
A fear of moving forward.

57:50.630 --> 57:52.140
You're exactly right.

57:52.140 --> 57:55.693
Something or someone is preventing
Jake from moving forward.

58:01.680 --> 58:04.010
We will be awake today, Jake

58:04.010 --> 58:07.400
and perhaps the ancient
ones will be able to channel

58:07.400 --> 58:09.893
even more energy through your hickey.

58:11.240 --> 58:13.427
I don't have a hickey.

58:13.427 --> 58:18.150
Hickeyawaiku. Hickeyawaiku.

58:18.150 --> 58:20.800
Drink this medicina for it as a gift

58:20.800 --> 58:21.813
from the pacha-mama.

58:36.537 --> 58:37.370
Oh man.

58:39.420 --> 58:40.820
I thought it was gonna be good.

58:40.820 --> 58:42.283
It's foolish to think that. Hickeyawaiku.

58:49.698 --> 58:51.837
Hondacord. Veolvo.

58:51.837 --> 58:53.340
Okay.

58:53.340 --> 58:54.173
What now?

58:55.540 --> 58:56.373
Now we wait.

58:57.710 --> 58:59.630
Feel free to wander
about with your thoughts

58:59.630 --> 59:01.233
and your feelings.

59:02.637 --> 59:05.762
Let go. Hickeyawaiku.

59:07.672 --> 59:09.488
Hickeyawaiku. Hickeyawaiku.

59:09.488 --> 59:10.707
Veolvo.

59:10.707 --> 59:15.192
Hickeyawaiku. Hickeyawaiku.

59:15.192 --> 59:16.358
Neesonn.

59:16.358 --> 59:17.475
Altima.

59:20.120 --> 59:21.573
The ceremony has begun.

59:23.490 --> 59:25.283
Here, have another.

59:26.712 --> 59:28.245
(tribal music)

59:32.820 --> 59:34.113
What the hell?

59:37.080 --> 59:37.913
Idiots.

59:37.913 --> 59:38.746
What did it say?

59:41.900 --> 59:42.733
Wow!

59:44.270 --> 59:45.103
Sir.

59:46.430 --> 59:47.580
What's up?

59:47.580 --> 59:50.380
That cart just blew past
me like a bat outta hell.

59:50.380 --> 59:52.730
He must have been doing 50 miles power.

59:52.730 --> 59:54.510
Don't you have any regulations?

59:54.510 --> 59:55.343
No, sir.

59:55.343 --> 59:57.110
Here at Twin Pines, you can
drive as fast as you like.

59:57.110 --> 59:58.300
And I personally took the governor

59:58.300 --> 59:59.640
off each and every one of these carts

59:59.640 --> 1:00:02.370
so you can knock out 18
holes in less than two hours.

1:00:02.370 --> 1:00:04.813
Hell, our sales grew up 33%.

1:00:06.230 --> 1:00:07.393
You have a nice day.

1:00:08.540 --> 1:00:10.633
Cocktail?
I don't think so.

1:00:12.567 --> 1:00:14.067
This place is a joke, daddy.

1:00:17.337 --> 1:00:18.170
(golf cart whirs)

1:00:18.170 --> 1:00:19.003
(folk music)

1:00:30.831 --> 1:00:32.560
[Gary] Is this a parking lot or a pasture?

1:00:32.560 --> 1:00:33.393
Come on.

1:00:33.393 --> 1:00:35.413
[Adrian] Looks like Coachella.
Hey, what is that?

1:00:35.413 --> 1:00:37.322
A pro shop?
I think so.

1:00:37.322 --> 1:00:39.620
Hey dad, it's a pro shop.
Can we get two tickets

1:00:39.620 --> 1:00:41.280
for golf please?

1:00:41.280 --> 1:00:43.350
[Gary] Who would actually
pay to come here?

1:00:43.350 --> 1:00:45.800
[Adrian] I feel like I'm gonna get robbed.

1:00:45.800 --> 1:00:47.627
[Jarvis] I've never seen anything like it.

1:00:47.627 --> 1:00:50.215
Is that a fucking crater?

1:00:50.215 --> 1:00:51.090
(Adrian laughs)

1:00:51.090 --> 1:00:53.350
Where are we?
I don't know.

1:00:53.350 --> 1:00:55.073
[Jarvis] This place is pathetic.

1:01:02.510 --> 1:01:03.384
It's terrible.

1:01:03.384 --> 1:01:04.420
What a joke.

1:01:04.420 --> 1:01:06.070
[Thomas] What the hell is this?

1:01:09.280 --> 1:01:12.093
How do we get across?
I don't know.

1:01:13.468 --> 1:01:15.768
[Adrian] Maybe we can
screen from the trees.

1:01:17.390 --> 1:01:19.920
[Thomas] This is so shitty,
I feel bad for the tractor.

1:01:19.920 --> 1:01:21.920
[Gary] I can't wait to watch them fail.

1:01:22.840 --> 1:01:24.993
[Adrian] You losers.
Oh my God.

1:01:46.646 --> 1:01:49.063
(Jake sighs)

1:02:08.050 --> 1:02:09.300
Golf isn't the problem.

1:02:21.557 --> 1:02:23.643
Feeling okay, buddy?

1:02:23.643 --> 1:02:25.643
I need to find Brandy.

1:02:27.060 --> 1:02:30.063
Hey, honeysuckle brother.

1:02:32.696 --> 1:02:34.114
I'm telling you, bro.

1:02:34.114 --> 1:02:37.093
I was like a lion dude all night, bro.

1:02:37.093 --> 1:02:38.555
Just pounding ass.

1:02:38.555 --> 1:02:40.005
Oh yeah, what was his name?

1:02:41.029 --> 1:02:42.840
I'm not gay, brother.

1:02:42.840 --> 1:02:44.333
You are gay, dude.

1:02:44.333 --> 1:02:45.800
I'm pansexual.

1:02:45.800 --> 1:02:46.633
What does that mean?

1:02:46.633 --> 1:02:48.713
Like you have sex with cookware?

1:02:53.260 --> 1:02:56.480
Ah, really, you thought I'd
fall for that again, dude?

1:02:56.480 --> 1:02:57.696
What?

1:02:57.696 --> 1:02:59.770
Hey, hey, get this on video.

1:02:59.770 --> 1:03:02.270
Let's see if Sir Hissyfit
likes a fat in his face.

1:03:05.976 --> 1:03:08.496
Shainski, that's not Sir Hissyfit.

1:03:08.496 --> 1:03:09.329
What?

1:03:11.952 --> 1:03:14.187
(Shane screams)

1:03:14.187 --> 1:03:15.437
Shainski, no.

1:03:17.994 --> 1:03:18.827
What do I have to do bro?

1:03:18.827 --> 1:03:19.660
What do I do?

1:03:19.660 --> 1:03:22.200
Oh dude, you have to suck the poison out.

1:03:22.200 --> 1:03:23.136
What?

1:03:23.136 --> 1:03:25.553
Suck it bro, I'm gonna die.

1:03:30.028 --> 1:03:33.111
(golf cart whirring)

1:03:36.900 --> 1:03:38.490
Suck my butt, dude.

1:03:38.490 --> 1:03:40.440
Suck my butt.

1:03:40.440 --> 1:03:44.110
Help, snake bite, snake bite.

1:03:44.110 --> 1:03:47.440
Listen, dude, if you love
me, you'll do it bro.

1:03:47.440 --> 1:03:50.167
Please, please suck my butt.

1:03:51.455 --> 1:03:52.538
Suck my butt.

1:03:56.940 --> 1:03:58.163
Oh that's what's up?

1:04:00.370 --> 1:04:02.000
Yeah.

1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:03.183
Fuck yeah, brother.

1:04:04.410 --> 1:04:06.030
Oh baby.

1:04:06.030 --> 1:04:07.870
Oh my God, yes.

1:04:07.870 --> 1:04:12.040
Hey bro, I will never
ever forget this dude.

1:04:12.040 --> 1:04:13.690
[Mikels] You better forget this!

1:04:13.690 --> 1:04:16.350
Don't stop dude, don't stop!

1:04:16.350 --> 1:04:17.993
Oh, I fucking love you, dude.

1:04:19.206 --> 1:04:20.700
Oh my God.

1:04:20.700 --> 1:04:21.533
Wrong way buddy.

1:04:21.533 --> 1:04:23.540
Huh?
Wrong way, buddy.

1:04:23.540 --> 1:04:26.050
Let's get you back to the
clubhouse for some soup.

1:04:26.050 --> 1:04:27.833
It's time for integration.

1:04:31.439 --> 1:04:34.522
(golf cart whirring)

1:04:41.840 --> 1:04:45.389
Shit, mi familia!

1:04:45.389 --> 1:04:46.541
What are you doin-

1:04:46.541 --> 1:04:47.374
Oops, sorry.

1:04:47.374 --> 1:04:48.810
You see my penis?

1:04:48.810 --> 1:04:53.810
Mr. Boyd, you are breaking into a million

1:04:54.120 --> 1:04:55.763
tiny pieces right now.

1:04:56.990 --> 1:04:57.823
It rules.

1:04:58.660 --> 1:05:01.500
Well, don't you fit in here just fine.

1:05:01.500 --> 1:05:02.870
I think so, I like it.

1:05:02.870 --> 1:05:04.730
And Nick says there's soup.

1:05:04.730 --> 1:05:05.643
It's super!

1:05:07.760 --> 1:05:08.883
No thank you.

1:05:10.980 --> 1:05:12.350
No?

1:05:12.350 --> 1:05:14.003
Okay, soup yourself.

1:05:20.960 --> 1:05:23.910
Wait till my sister finds out about this.

1:05:23.910 --> 1:05:25.686
You loser!

1:05:25.686 --> 1:05:28.103
(both laugh)

1:05:30.087 --> 1:05:31.603
Oh, fuck, Brandy.

1:05:34.287 --> 1:05:35.637
I think I got it all bro.

1:05:37.720 --> 1:05:39.116
I love you, bro.

1:05:39.116 --> 1:05:40.583
I fucking love you, bro.

1:05:42.932 --> 1:05:44.458
You saved my life.

1:05:44.458 --> 1:05:46.160
Bitch, you saved my life!

1:05:46.160 --> 1:05:48.472
This snake's not poisonous.

1:05:48.472 --> 1:05:49.305
What?

1:05:50.704 --> 1:05:52.287
It's not poisonous.

1:05:53.262 --> 1:05:58.262
I mean the bite might hurt a
little bit, but you'll be fine.

1:05:59.624 --> 1:06:01.473
You're gonna fucking die, bro!

1:06:03.623 --> 1:06:04.456
(man grunting)

1:06:04.456 --> 1:06:05.289
(rock music)

1:06:17.310 --> 1:06:19.160
[Nick] Jake, great work today, man.

1:06:19.160 --> 1:06:20.093
Real breakthrough.

1:06:21.000 --> 1:06:23.090
And I know, I know, I know.

1:06:23.090 --> 1:06:24.770
You can't wait for tomorrow's ceremony.

1:06:24.770 --> 1:06:25.603
We'll do this again.

1:06:25.603 --> 1:06:27.170
[Jake] No, I'm never
doing this again, man.

1:06:27.170 --> 1:06:28.890
[Nick] Oh-okie dokie,
you get some good sleep.

1:06:28.890 --> 1:06:30.890
Yeah, goodnight.
All right, cheers.

1:06:31.778 --> 1:06:34.861
(car engine revving)

1:06:45.140 --> 1:06:47.793
Gummy bear, you home?

1:07:04.783 --> 1:07:05.616
Brandy.

1:07:08.140 --> 1:07:08.973
Brandy.

1:07:09.930 --> 1:07:11.893
Hey, can we talk?

1:07:13.230 --> 1:07:15.030
Did you quit, baby?

1:07:15.030 --> 1:07:16.523
Oh no, no I can't.

1:07:17.407 --> 1:07:18.330
I'm going to sleep.

1:07:18.330 --> 1:07:19.330
No, wait, no.

1:07:19.330 --> 1:07:21.080
We need to talk about college.

1:07:21.080 --> 1:07:22.913
No, why?

1:07:23.893 --> 1:07:25.943
Because I had an epiphany.

1:07:27.470 --> 1:07:31.210
You know, you've been blaming
golf for all of our problems.

1:07:31.210 --> 1:07:32.623
It's not golf.

1:07:34.950 --> 1:07:36.320
What do you mean?

1:07:36.320 --> 1:07:37.540
Why?

1:07:37.540 --> 1:07:41.540
It's me, it's always been me.

1:07:41.540 --> 1:07:43.400
I fucked up.

1:07:43.400 --> 1:07:45.253
I cheated on you, Brandy.

1:07:46.309 --> 1:07:48.890
Fuck, how can you trust me?

1:07:48.890 --> 1:07:50.383
I don't deserve you.

1:07:51.883 --> 1:07:52.800
I'm stupid.

1:07:55.320 --> 1:07:56.943
What is wrong with you?

1:07:59.574 --> 1:08:00.424
Are you on drugs?

1:08:02.500 --> 1:08:03.333
No.

1:08:04.890 --> 1:08:06.633
Am I on drugs?

1:08:08.630 --> 1:08:13.305
Yeah, yeah, a little bit,
but it's just like a cactus.

1:08:13.305 --> 1:08:14.330
It's not what you think.

1:08:14.330 --> 1:08:18.940
It's a cactus and you chop
it up and you boil it.

1:08:18.940 --> 1:08:23.410
And you have to sit in a tent
and you have to drink this.

1:08:23.410 --> 1:08:27.310
And when you wake up,
everything is a million pieces

1:08:29.126 --> 1:08:29.960
and then you...

1:08:34.090 --> 1:08:35.720
What were we talking about?

1:08:35.720 --> 1:08:37.280
You're just saying all this
'cause you're fucked up.

1:08:37.280 --> 1:08:38.330
No, it's not.

1:08:38.330 --> 1:08:40.040
I'm not fucked up, I was.

1:08:40.040 --> 1:08:41.507
You should have seen me before.

1:08:41.507 --> 1:08:46.307
This is all happening again
because of golf, Jake.

1:08:46.307 --> 1:08:47.710
No, it's not because of golf.

1:08:47.710 --> 1:08:50.580
I realized the problem this time, it's me.

1:08:50.580 --> 1:08:53.347
I fucked up, but I understand it now.

1:08:54.775 --> 1:08:56.775
Just get the fuck out.

1:08:58.215 --> 1:08:59.223
What?

1:08:59.223 --> 1:09:01.037
Don't come back.

1:09:01.037 --> 1:09:01.954
Are you serious?

1:09:01.954 --> 1:09:03.231
Yeah.

1:09:03.231 --> 1:09:05.064
Just get the fuck out.

1:09:09.763 --> 1:09:12.846
(instrumental music)

1:10:01.390 --> 1:10:03.240
[Rodney] Hey there, you Conroy?

1:10:03.240 --> 1:10:04.890
Yeah, Rodney?
Yeah, that's me.

1:10:04.890 --> 1:10:05.723
Come on in.

1:10:06.830 --> 1:10:09.356
How you doing today, where are we headed?

1:10:09.356 --> 1:10:10.887
Straight to hell, my man.

1:10:10.887 --> 1:10:13.060
But drop me off the Twin Pines first.

1:10:13.060 --> 1:10:16.276
You got it, need to pick
up some weed anyway.

1:10:16.276 --> 1:10:19.359
(instrumental music)

1:10:40.006 --> 1:10:42.173
Oh, I gotta take a shit.

1:10:56.030 --> 1:10:58.090
Hey, are you okay?

1:10:58.090 --> 1:11:00.420
Yeah Ms. Gladys, never better.

1:11:00.420 --> 1:11:01.490
I feel like a million bucks.

1:11:01.490 --> 1:11:02.910
Beer?

1:11:02.910 --> 1:11:04.250
I really shouldn't.

1:11:04.250 --> 1:11:05.333
Okay fella.

1:11:11.140 --> 1:11:13.340
Charlie Conroy, you are cut off.

1:11:13.340 --> 1:11:15.300
I was seriously just getting ready

1:11:15.300 --> 1:11:16.370
to give that back to her.

1:11:16.370 --> 1:11:17.790
Gladys, do you want this?

1:11:17.790 --> 1:11:19.420
Knock yourself out.

1:11:19.420 --> 1:11:20.933
Inside, now.

1:11:25.934 --> 1:11:28.684
They're coming, they're coming.

1:11:32.289 --> 1:11:33.122
[Everyone] Surprise!!

1:11:33.122 --> 1:11:33.955
(dance muscic)

1:11:34.982 --> 1:11:37.502
We did it, we did it!

1:11:37.502 --> 1:11:38.335
We did it.

1:11:40.127 --> 1:11:41.710
Oh, welcome back chief.

1:11:41.710 --> 1:11:43.120
Great job not dying.

1:11:43.120 --> 1:11:44.620
Jesus Christ, what is wrong with you?

1:11:44.620 --> 1:11:46.110
We waited so long for you so long.

1:11:46.110 --> 1:11:48.180
Okay, let's get this party started.

1:11:48.180 --> 1:11:49.680
Go ahead Fred, load us up.

1:11:49.680 --> 1:11:50.960
He doesn't drink anymore,

1:11:50.960 --> 1:11:52.733
he just got out of the hospital, Nick.

1:11:54.170 --> 1:11:55.813
Actually, Nick, I can't.

1:11:57.490 --> 1:12:02.387
The doctor says I need to give
the ticker time to catch up.

1:12:02.387 --> 1:12:04.715
I have to stay away from booze for a bit.

1:12:04.715 --> 1:12:05.548
Great story bro.

1:12:05.548 --> 1:12:06.381
Here you go.

1:12:07.390 --> 1:12:08.643
No, no, I can't.

1:12:11.240 --> 1:12:12.073
Here's to the boss.

1:12:12.073 --> 1:12:13.443
Long with the chief.

1:12:13.443 --> 1:12:15.776
[All] Long live the chief.

1:12:17.228 --> 1:12:18.950
Hey, back to work, everyone.

1:12:18.950 --> 1:12:20.630
Let's go back to work.

1:12:20.630 --> 1:12:22.437
We did it, we got him!

1:12:23.559 --> 1:12:24.892
We got him good.

1:12:25.754 --> 1:12:28.000
Let's get an inventory.

1:12:28.000 --> 1:12:30.000
Catch me up on the state of the club.

1:12:30.000 --> 1:12:32.450
The golf club is
operating marginally, sir,

1:12:32.450 --> 1:12:35.140
with as many underpaid and
under-qualified employees

1:12:35.140 --> 1:12:38.550
as this mediocre town can
provide within budget, of course.

1:12:38.550 --> 1:12:41.150
Like I said, this machine is
pretty much running itself,

1:12:41.150 --> 1:12:42.220
I can say proudly.

1:12:42.220 --> 1:12:44.660
The bar is fully stocked as usual.

1:12:44.660 --> 1:12:47.440
But since you're absence,
we actually have a surplus.

1:12:47.440 --> 1:12:49.280
Yeah, Eñejo just finished
all the new signage

1:12:49.280 --> 1:12:51.940
and all the greens and
fairways are in top condition.

1:12:51.940 --> 1:12:53.510
That's obviously, that's not true,

1:12:53.510 --> 1:12:56.020
but seems like you need good news.

1:12:56.020 --> 1:12:57.100
Great work.

1:12:57.100 --> 1:12:59.240
Now let's talk tournament.

1:12:59.240 --> 1:13:02.450
How's everybody looking,
everybody playing okay?

1:13:02.450 --> 1:13:04.040
You're not playing.

1:13:04.040 --> 1:13:05.287
What do you mean?

1:13:05.287 --> 1:13:08.850
You just got outta the
hospital, you are not playing.

1:13:08.850 --> 1:13:10.920
Yeah, man, everyone knows
about the heart attack.

1:13:10.920 --> 1:13:12.630
Also the bet, everyone
knows about the bet.

1:13:12.630 --> 1:13:14.623
That was ill advised.

1:13:17.280 --> 1:13:21.390
Look, I need to go
practice so that you all

1:13:21.390 --> 1:13:22.560
can keep your jobs.

1:13:22.560 --> 1:13:23.503
I need a tee time.

1:13:24.476 --> 1:13:25.443
Oh, yes sir.

1:13:27.380 --> 1:13:30.440
Dogleg, we got a tee
time for boss man step.

1:13:30.440 --> 1:13:32.470
[Dogleg] We're all clear,
there's no one here today.

1:13:32.470 --> 1:13:34.463
Oh, okay, thank you so much.

1:13:35.380 --> 1:13:37.570
Conroy, you're not playing.

1:13:37.570 --> 1:13:40.633
Not listening to you and
we will reconvene later.

1:13:42.490 --> 1:13:44.440
Does anyone listen to me around here?

1:13:47.170 --> 1:13:49.710
He's acting strange, no?

1:13:49.710 --> 1:13:51.783
Maybe he had like a
bad dream or something.

1:13:53.253 --> 1:13:54.086
Yeah, yeah.

1:13:54.086 --> 1:13:54.919
(somber music)

1:14:18.033 --> 1:14:20.533
(duck cooing)

1:14:45.648 --> 1:14:48.481
(Conroy groaning)

1:15:02.313 --> 1:15:04.353
Dude, are you trying to kill me.

1:15:05.372 --> 1:15:06.913
Are you worried about
that bet with Jarvis?

1:15:08.280 --> 1:15:10.080
You've been looking at other jobs?

1:15:12.140 --> 1:15:12.973
Right.

1:15:12.973 --> 1:15:14.870
I told Fred that to motivate you, man.

1:15:14.870 --> 1:15:16.220
Hell, if I had kids, them and their kids

1:15:16.220 --> 1:15:17.760
would owe you for my bar tab.

1:15:17.760 --> 1:15:19.330
You kidding?

1:15:19.330 --> 1:15:21.520
Twin Pines is losing steam though.

1:15:21.520 --> 1:15:22.848
With that attitude.

1:15:22.848 --> 1:15:25.503
Well, I just don't know
where we went wrong.

1:15:26.570 --> 1:15:27.490
Me neither.

1:15:30.192 --> 1:15:32.620
Is there anyone at this club
that knows how to play golf?

1:15:32.620 --> 1:15:35.400
I mean, you've seen all we got.

1:15:35.400 --> 1:15:36.726
Shainski might jump in for you.

1:15:36.726 --> 1:15:37.559
Okay.

1:15:38.513 --> 1:15:40.013
What the fuck am I gonna do?

1:15:41.810 --> 1:15:43.010
Probably lose the bet.

1:15:51.890 --> 1:15:52.723
This is good for the heart, right?

1:15:52.723 --> 1:15:53.556
(Conroy plays guitar)

1:16:00.152 --> 1:16:04.027
Well, I don't understand
what God's done to me.

1:16:05.594 --> 1:16:10.594
'cause I'm short in the
britches and long off the tee...

1:16:10.651 --> 1:16:14.967
I've hit every fairway
since I've been alive...

1:16:16.427 --> 1:16:20.918
But Jesus won't give me no sexual drive.

1:16:21.909 --> 1:16:26.373
Well I've got lots of balls
and I'm always in clubs.

1:16:26.373 --> 1:16:30.181
And I've hooked up with skinnies
and crazies and chubs...

1:16:31.695 --> 1:16:35.857
I've dated some ladies
that were awful fun...

1:16:35.857 --> 1:16:40.623
But I ain't never got to the hole-in-one.

1:16:55.232 --> 1:16:57.048
(club music)

1:18:04.382 --> 1:18:05.801
What the fuck are we gonna do about Shane?

1:18:05.801 --> 1:18:07.852
Yeah, that was pretty bad.

1:18:07.852 --> 1:18:08.879
How you doing?

1:18:08.879 --> 1:18:09.742
Hello sir.

1:18:09.742 --> 1:18:11.442
Come on here, let's grab a seat.

1:18:13.900 --> 1:18:15.836
You want a drink or something?

1:18:15.836 --> 1:18:16.669
Yeah!

1:18:20.500 --> 1:18:24.540
Okay, so you're bit all
over the place out there

1:18:25.422 --> 1:18:27.160
and we really need to win this tournament

1:18:27.160 --> 1:18:28.950
otherwise we're history.

1:18:28.950 --> 1:18:29.783
Tournament?

1:18:31.610 --> 1:18:32.443
Right.

1:18:34.730 --> 1:18:37.290
[Fred] Everyone, I'd like
to introduce you to Khalil,

1:18:37.290 --> 1:18:40.810
our newest member and scratch golfer.

1:18:40.810 --> 1:18:42.037
Is he now? Would you maybe
be interested in playing

1:18:43.570 --> 1:18:44.820
in this little tournament
we got coming up?

1:18:44.820 --> 1:18:48.010
We got an extra spot and
sure wanna beat the shit

1:18:48.010 --> 1:18:49.230
out of Magnolia Pointe.

1:18:49.230 --> 1:18:51.281
Fuck yeah man.

1:18:51.281 --> 1:18:52.114
Yes.

1:18:52.114 --> 1:18:52.963
I like your enthusiasm.

1:18:54.660 --> 1:18:55.493
Really?

1:18:55.493 --> 1:18:56.326
Oh yeah.

1:18:56.326 --> 1:18:58.710
That's fucking- 10 seconds ago,

1:18:58.710 --> 1:19:00.540
we were just talking
about how screwed we were.

1:19:00.540 --> 1:19:01.440
Hell yeah, dude.

1:19:01.440 --> 1:19:02.993
There we go, dream team, done.

1:19:05.190 --> 1:19:08.370
Well, as my dad used to say,

1:19:08.370 --> 1:19:13.370
a birdie marks anything of
excellence, and you guys,

1:19:15.000 --> 1:19:16.611
y'all are my birdies.

1:19:17.500 --> 1:19:19.290
Right, since we aren't drinking.

1:19:19.290 --> 1:19:20.130
Cheers to that.

1:19:20.130 --> 1:19:21.297
Oh cheers.

1:19:21.297 --> 1:19:22.130
Cheers.

1:19:22.130 --> 1:19:23.963
Cheers.
Cheers to that.

1:19:25.080 --> 1:19:26.278
Yeah, cheers bro.

1:19:26.278 --> 1:19:27.111
Welcome!

1:19:27.111 --> 1:19:29.390
All right, let's fucking get to work.

1:19:29.390 --> 1:19:30.223
[Fred] Get to work.

1:19:30.223 --> 1:19:31.056
Let's go with these guys.

1:19:31.056 --> 1:19:32.156
We're gonna kick their ass.

1:19:32.156 --> 1:19:34.322
(upbeat music)

1:19:39.658 --> 1:19:42.491
(golf club bangs)

1:19:47.540 --> 1:19:48.513
Cheers, cheers.

1:19:53.330 --> 1:19:55.117
Okie, dokie, all right, Nick.

1:19:55.117 --> 1:19:56.217
Right, right, right.

1:20:10.324 --> 1:20:13.002
(golf club bangs)

1:20:13.002 --> 1:20:16.085
(golf ball whistles)

1:21:09.943 --> 1:21:14.884
(dramatic music)

1:21:46.620 --> 1:21:49.100
[Marvin Gleeman] Cardinals
chirping in the Pines.

1:21:49.100 --> 1:21:52.750
Wind whisping through the Bermuda grass.

1:21:52.750 --> 1:21:55.690
Alligators nipping at our heels.

1:21:55.690 --> 1:21:58.200
It's that time of year again, folks.

1:21:58.200 --> 1:22:00.040
[Lucy Overwood] Welcome
to the 30th annual,

1:22:00.040 --> 1:22:03.180
Dixie invitational captain's
choice golf tournament

1:22:03.180 --> 1:22:06.130
on this beautiful day at
Twin Pines golf course.

1:22:06.130 --> 1:22:07.360
Is that local news?

1:22:07.360 --> 1:22:09.260
Yeah, Jarvis is trying to
make a big deal out of this.

1:22:09.260 --> 1:22:10.319
Marvin Gleeman.

1:22:10.319 --> 1:22:11.152
Marvin!

1:22:11.152 --> 1:22:12.117
I did blow with him once.

1:22:12.117 --> 1:22:14.055
[Dogleg] Just once?
So many times.

1:22:14.055 --> 1:22:16.413
[Marvin] Welcome to
another Dixie invitational

1:22:16.413 --> 1:22:17.795
at Twin Pines.

1:22:18.870 --> 1:22:21.920
Today, the big focus is Adrian Boyd,

1:22:21.920 --> 1:22:24.630
the five times champion team captain

1:22:24.630 --> 1:22:27.530
and on the other end, Jake Baxter,

1:22:27.530 --> 1:22:31.233
Charlie Conroy's new club
pro here at Twin Pines.

1:22:31.233 --> 1:22:32.066
Now we hear-

1:22:32.066 --> 1:22:33.099
[Pop] Oh shit.

1:22:33.099 --> 1:22:35.460
[Marvin] A slight rivalry
brewing between these two clubs.

1:22:35.460 --> 1:22:38.090
What are Jake Baxter's chances, John,

1:22:38.090 --> 1:22:40.670
and what does his competition
look like this year?

1:22:40.670 --> 1:22:41.870
[John Ingersall] These
guys from Twin Pines

1:22:41.870 --> 1:22:43.386
who are calling themselves The Birdies

1:22:43.386 --> 1:22:45.780
will make anything but that.

1:22:45.780 --> 1:22:48.040
And they have as much chance
as a preacher's daughter

1:22:48.040 --> 1:22:48.873
in Vegas.

1:22:48.873 --> 1:22:51.830
- Well, strong words, John, strong words.

1:22:51.830 --> 1:22:52.840
But that's right.

1:22:52.840 --> 1:22:54.550
But Baxter had a promising future

1:22:54.550 --> 1:22:58.150
before he mysteriously
vanished from the landscape

1:22:58.150 --> 1:23:02.510
of amateur golf amids personal
troubles over 10 years ago.

1:23:02.510 --> 1:23:06.280
Today he looks for redemption as he plays

1:23:06.280 --> 1:23:09.010
against his former teammate, Adrian Boyd,

1:23:09.010 --> 1:23:11.750
the tenured pro from Magnolia Pointe.

1:23:11.750 --> 1:23:14.810
- That's right and they
have a surprise entrant.

1:23:14.810 --> 1:23:18.960
International legend, the
pro golfer, John Nightly.

1:23:18.960 --> 1:23:20.269
- Whoa.

1:23:20.269 --> 1:23:23.280
[John Nightly] Baby, what
do you want from a man?!

1:23:23.280 --> 1:23:26.224
His great aunt was a
member of Magnolia Pointe,

1:23:26.224 --> 1:23:27.432
did you know that?

1:23:27.432 --> 1:23:28.634
- I did not know that.

1:23:28.634 --> 1:23:31.610
- Come on, Boyd, we got this.

1:23:31.610 --> 1:23:32.947
Not today, bitch.

1:23:34.460 --> 1:23:36.413
Oh I can't wait to hit this!

1:23:37.327 --> 1:23:39.850
Ooh, shimmy, shimmy.

1:23:40.820 --> 1:23:42.453
So you can't play now.

1:23:43.850 --> 1:23:45.653
Just playing by your rules.

1:23:49.406 --> 1:23:50.319
[Nightly] Oh, whoopsie.

1:23:50.319 --> 1:23:51.800
Hi.

1:23:51.800 --> 1:23:52.840
Hello.

1:23:52.840 --> 1:23:54.280
How are things?

1:23:54.280 --> 1:23:55.193
Not here.

1:24:00.628 --> 1:24:03.393
Whoo! Smashed potatoes!

1:24:03.393 --> 1:24:06.357
- [Marvin] And that's the first
shot at the Dixie Classic,

1:24:06.357 --> 1:24:08.380
the tournament of marginal playing,

1:24:08.380 --> 1:24:10.920
and culturally insensitive verbiage.

1:24:10.920 --> 1:24:12.000
All right!

1:24:12.000 --> 1:24:13.425
[Ingersall] That's right next up,

1:24:13.425 --> 1:24:14.760
we have captain Adrian Boyd

1:24:14.760 --> 1:24:18.180
for team protein from Magnolia Pointe.

1:24:18.180 --> 1:24:19.890
Are these guys for real?

1:24:19.890 --> 1:24:23.100
- Look, I don't know anything
about these fucking hicks.

1:24:23.100 --> 1:24:26.936
So just stick to the
script, you Irish twat.

1:24:28.160 --> 1:24:30.060
[Marvin] Adrian Boyd.

1:24:30.060 --> 1:24:33.850
This douchebag has never seen
a real day of work in his life

1:24:33.850 --> 1:24:34.683
and his hands.

1:24:34.683 --> 1:24:38.440
Well, they are softer
than a newborn's ass.

1:24:38.440 --> 1:24:39.993
Let's see what he does.

1:24:43.910 --> 1:24:48.196
Whoa, what a shot and
we are underway folks.

1:24:48.196 --> 1:24:50.775
HADOUKEN!

1:24:50.775 --> 1:24:52.100
- Oh God, that's gross.

1:24:52.100 --> 1:24:53.408
Pretty dumb.

1:24:53.408 --> 1:24:55.333
(intense music)

1:24:59.740 --> 1:25:01.332
[Nightly] That was a send!

1:25:05.269 --> 1:25:07.840
(audience cheering)

1:25:07.840 --> 1:25:10.433
[Marvin] Next up is
Baxter and team Birdies.

1:25:13.280 --> 1:25:14.113
That'll work.

1:25:15.562 --> 1:25:16.895
Kah-fucking-PING!

1:25:19.120 --> 1:25:20.561
Shit.

1:25:20.561 --> 1:25:23.311
(water sloshing)

1:25:28.225 --> 1:25:31.392
(audience applauding)

1:25:34.250 --> 1:25:35.350
Captain's choice.

1:25:35.350 --> 1:25:37.273
Which ball will you
choose, Captain Baxter?

1:25:37.273 --> 1:25:38.106
I think we'll be using my ball, sir.

1:25:39.106 --> 1:25:40.931
(music intensifies)

1:25:47.590 --> 1:25:48.663
Too easy, baby.

1:25:56.600 --> 1:25:58.000
Yes, sir.
There she is.

1:25:58.922 --> 1:26:02.100
(audience applauding)

1:26:02.100 --> 1:26:03.700
This one's going down the pipe.

1:26:08.353 --> 1:26:09.853
[Nightly] Party boy!

1:26:11.447 --> 1:26:14.880
[Marvin] Oh, John Nightly
shows us his famous beer shower

1:26:14.880 --> 1:26:16.290
celebration.

1:26:16.290 --> 1:26:18.260
I am the best golfer ever!

1:26:19.258 --> 1:26:20.645
[Marvin] Now for the birdies.

1:26:20.645 --> 1:26:21.857
[Adrian] Oh my God.

1:26:21.857 --> 1:26:23.410
I fucking love you guys.

1:26:23.410 --> 1:26:24.763
[Marvin] Baxter up first.

1:26:27.113 --> 1:26:28.113
(cheers) Hey, yeah.

1:26:30.405 --> 1:26:32.205
[Gary] Is this a joke?

1:26:32.205 --> 1:26:33.450
Oh my God, I hate poor people.

1:26:33.450 --> 1:26:35.250
[Marvin] Now at the tee, Nick Hayes.

1:26:36.230 --> 1:26:37.063
Whoa.

1:26:39.607 --> 1:26:42.774
(audience applauding)

1:26:44.030 --> 1:26:44.863
Sweet.

1:26:45.770 --> 1:26:47.883
[Marvin] Next up, Emily Calhoun.

1:26:50.790 --> 1:26:52.090
[Gary] Ooh, I'm a girl!

1:26:52.090 --> 1:26:53.490
I might ask her out later.

1:26:55.259 --> 1:26:57.710
And last up, Khalil Al-Asmari,

1:26:57.710 --> 1:26:59.783
the newest member of Twin Pines.

1:27:00.920 --> 1:27:02.910
[Ingersall This guy's
got all types of talent.

1:27:02.910 --> 1:27:04.960
[Marvin] The late
edition from team Birdies

1:27:04.960 --> 1:27:07.100
is really lighting it up.

1:27:07.100 --> 1:27:08.350
Where did he come from?

1:27:08.350 --> 1:27:09.423
Who is this guy?

1:27:11.921 --> 1:27:13.415
(audience applauding)

1:27:13.415 --> 1:27:15.515
Twin Pines is so lucky to have this guy.

1:27:17.270 --> 1:27:20.113
[Marvin] Captain Protein rips another one.

1:27:29.134 --> 1:27:30.067
(regurgitates)

1:27:30.067 --> 1:27:31.740
Oh, that's unfortunate.

1:27:31.740 --> 1:27:34.540
Tell you what Marv, John
lightly does not look well.

1:27:34.540 --> 1:27:35.923
No, he does not.

1:27:36.760 --> 1:27:37.603
About time.

1:27:38.450 --> 1:27:39.583
I need some coke!

1:27:40.720 --> 1:27:42.733
Huh, he's fine.

1:27:51.990 --> 1:27:55.157
(audience applauding)

1:27:58.994 --> 1:28:00.493
[Man] What'd you use bro?

1:28:05.173 --> 1:28:08.423
(audience applauding)

1:28:19.120 --> 1:28:22.000
Well, well, well, look who showed up.

1:28:22.000 --> 1:28:24.545
You are not off the hook.

1:28:24.545 --> 1:28:25.397
Dammit, seriously.

1:28:25.397 --> 1:28:29.700
But I love you Jake Baxter
no matter what you do.

1:28:29.700 --> 1:28:32.117
Now go kick this prick's ass.

1:28:33.580 --> 1:28:34.413
My girl.

1:28:39.620 --> 1:28:40.453
Daughter.

1:28:42.450 --> 1:28:43.283
Daddy.

1:28:45.660 --> 1:28:49.827
[Marvin] We are tied up
folks! Onto the back nine.

1:28:57.924 --> 1:29:00.273
- Oh my God, that made my dick hard.

1:29:05.693 --> 1:29:06.844
Yeah, I'll stick with it.

1:29:06.844 --> 1:29:08.640
I'm gonna stick with this golf thing.

1:29:17.720 --> 1:29:18.970
Oh my gosh, you missed.

1:29:23.696 --> 1:29:26.909
(audience cheering)

1:29:26.909 --> 1:29:27.742
[Marvin] That's a Birdie for
Emily Calhoun of Team Birdies.

1:29:27.742 --> 1:29:28.575
[Ingersall] Showing us their
namesake in more than one way.

1:29:28.575 --> 1:29:30.908
An eagle for team Protein.

1:29:48.020 --> 1:29:48.853
Yeah boy!

1:29:55.667 --> 1:29:56.803
(cheers)

1:29:56.803 --> 1:29:57.886
- Woo.
- Nice.

1:29:58.792 --> 1:30:01.625
(golf club bangs)

1:30:43.607 --> 1:30:44.600
We're on the last whole game.

1:30:44.600 --> 1:30:47.560
Team protein needs
something big happen here.

1:30:47.560 --> 1:30:49.640
There are one back from a playoff.

1:30:49.640 --> 1:30:50.633
Here we go.

1:30:55.948 --> 1:30:56.870
[Gary] Roper.

1:30:56.870 --> 1:30:57.723
There you go.

1:31:01.050 --> 1:31:03.693
It's actually better than I thought.

1:31:05.720 --> 1:31:09.433
Jesus, you're worse than Thomas!

1:31:15.401 --> 1:31:18.234
(golf club bangs)

1:31:19.520 --> 1:31:22.030
In certain circles,
that's a really good shot.

1:31:22.030 --> 1:31:24.470
[Marvin] Twin Pines needs just par to win

1:31:24.470 --> 1:31:26.400
and they're putting for Birdie.

1:31:26.400 --> 1:31:28.567
They've got to make this shot to win.

1:31:34.770 --> 1:31:36.480
Holy shit folks.

1:31:36.480 --> 1:31:37.550
They're blowing it.

1:31:37.550 --> 1:31:39.610
[Ingersall] I can't believe
this, Magnolia Pointe

1:31:39.610 --> 1:31:41.563
is still in this match.

1:31:43.960 --> 1:31:44.793
[Adrian] You putt like a girl.

1:31:44.793 --> 1:31:45.626
[Jake] It's all right.

1:31:52.390 --> 1:31:56.840
[Marvin] Unbelievable, meltdown
from these unpredictable

1:31:56.840 --> 1:31:58.120
Birdies from Twin Pines.

1:31:58.120 --> 1:32:01.680
If they can't make it,
they lose, or we gotta tie

1:32:01.680 --> 1:32:04.870
and go into a three
hole, one-on-one playoff.

1:32:04.870 --> 1:32:05.970
[Ingersall] Baxter wants this one.

1:32:09.070 --> 1:32:10.350
In the hole!

1:32:10.350 --> 1:32:11.823
We gotta tie folks.

1:32:13.700 --> 1:32:16.790
[Marvin] We go into a three
hole playoff, winner take all.

1:32:16.790 --> 1:32:18.940
The team captains must play head, head,

1:32:18.940 --> 1:32:21.460
individual match play to break the tie.

1:32:21.460 --> 1:32:23.930
That's good because John
Nightly is disqualified

1:32:23.930 --> 1:32:27.560
as he has passed out on hole 16

1:32:27.560 --> 1:32:29.800
and weirdly nobody is
paying any attention.

1:32:29.800 --> 1:32:31.990
Just another day on
the course for Nightly.

1:32:31.990 --> 1:32:35.593
Magnolia Pointe is away,
so Boyd will tee off first.

1:32:38.528 --> 1:32:40.336
HADOUKEN.

1:32:41.420 --> 1:32:43.469
Fuck.

1:32:57.735 --> 1:33:00.320
(birds chirping)

1:33:00.320 --> 1:33:02.600
Baxter for eagle.

1:33:02.600 --> 1:33:04.257
You know what to do Jakey Bear.

1:33:04.257 --> 1:33:05.780
Oh my God.

1:33:05.780 --> 1:33:07.460
Not only are you a part of this universe,

1:33:07.460 --> 1:33:10.550
but you are the universe.

1:33:10.550 --> 1:33:11.720
For sure, thanks dude.

1:33:11.720 --> 1:33:13.530
You are that tiny little white ball.

1:33:13.530 --> 1:33:15.492
Nick, I'm trying to focus here, man.

1:33:15.492 --> 1:33:16.780
You're that tiny little
white ball that happens

1:33:16.780 --> 1:33:18.250
to have a big fat hickey on your neck.

1:33:18.250 --> 1:33:20.120
I don't have a fucking hickey,
just get outta here, dude.

1:33:20.120 --> 1:33:21.543
Good luck.
So annoying.

1:33:27.620 --> 1:33:28.610
Mark it.

1:33:28.610 --> 1:33:31.693
[Ingersall] Big mistake and a
disappointment for that Eagle.

1:33:34.850 --> 1:33:36.466
You know what to do Adrian-

1:33:36.466 --> 1:33:37.594
Fuck bro.

1:33:37.594 --> 1:33:38.990
I'm sorry, I'm sorry about that.

1:33:46.707 --> 1:33:49.918
And Boyd makes the putt in the hole.

1:33:49.918 --> 1:33:50.918
Whoa baby.

1:33:58.570 --> 1:33:59.770
Yet another Birdie.

1:33:59.770 --> 1:34:01.070
Big missed opportunity.

1:34:01.070 --> 1:34:04.760
Baxter still manages to be
one under in the playoffs.

1:34:04.760 --> 1:34:09.757
One under for Boyd and
Baxter and on to the next.

1:34:09.757 --> 1:34:11.840
How do my calves look?

1:34:11.840 --> 1:34:13.540
Always beautiful, you know that?

1:34:15.240 --> 1:34:16.073
[Nick] Yes sir.

1:34:20.697 --> 1:34:22.327
HADOUKEN!

1:34:22.327 --> 1:34:23.993
(audience applauding)

1:34:23.993 --> 1:34:25.243
(laughs) From earlier.

1:34:33.520 --> 1:34:36.050
It's fine, I don't mind a shorter walk.

1:34:36.050 --> 1:34:37.790
Did you dye your hair more blonde?

1:34:37.790 --> 1:34:38.623
What?

1:34:38.623 --> 1:34:39.456
Did you dye your hair more blonde?

1:34:39.456 --> 1:34:40.740
This is fucking natural.

1:34:46.990 --> 1:34:48.570
That's what I'm talking about, baby.

1:34:48.570 --> 1:34:51.003
[Marvin] And Boyd makes the putt.

1:34:53.777 --> 1:34:56.042
(audience cheering)

1:34:56.042 --> 1:34:57.420
It's in the hole.

1:34:57.420 --> 1:34:59.152
On to the next.

1:34:59.152 --> 1:34:59.985
Birdie, Birdie.

1:34:59.985 --> 1:35:00.818
Yessir!

1:35:05.850 --> 1:35:07.860
[Marvin] We're on the final hole, people.

1:35:07.860 --> 1:35:09.610
This is a 300 yard par four.

1:35:09.610 --> 1:35:13.060
And I believe both these
gentlemen are capable

1:35:13.060 --> 1:35:15.400
of getting it near the green,

1:35:15.400 --> 1:35:18.840
but it will take a lot of club, John.

1:35:18.840 --> 1:35:21.290
And even more balls, Marvin.

1:35:21.290 --> 1:35:22.830
Yes, John.

1:35:22.830 --> 1:35:26.263
It will take big, huge testicles.

1:35:39.290 --> 1:35:41.643
Boyd with an amazing drive.

1:35:41.643 --> 1:35:44.080
This is my storybook ending.

1:35:44.080 --> 1:35:45.667
This is my storybook ending!

1:35:49.660 --> 1:35:50.493
[Ingersall] And some
inappropriate gestures

1:35:50.493 --> 1:35:51.326
being exchanged folks.

1:35:52.870 --> 1:35:55.590
So if you have any kids
that are watching at home,

1:35:55.590 --> 1:35:57.770
you should really rethink your parenting

1:35:57.770 --> 1:35:59.570
and grab a Swinger Lite.

1:35:59.570 --> 1:36:01.460
Long day on the links?

1:36:01.460 --> 1:36:02.430
Pound a Swinger.

1:36:02.430 --> 1:36:05.320
We love Swinger.

1:36:05.320 --> 1:36:06.613
That's right, John.

1:36:08.880 --> 1:36:12.220
Speaking of Swinger, Adrian
Boyd could still swing himself

1:36:12.220 --> 1:36:14.370
into a birdie if he can get on the green

1:36:14.370 --> 1:36:16.230
with his next shot.

1:36:16.230 --> 1:36:18.450
Or Baxter's short game
could fail him once again.

1:36:18.450 --> 1:36:19.350
That's possible.

1:36:22.632 --> 1:36:23.793
It's the perfect hole?

1:36:32.990 --> 1:36:34.498
We are the Birdies...

1:36:35.798 --> 1:36:37.337
[Nick Whispers] Birdies, birdies

1:36:37.337 --> 1:36:40.512

[Team Birdies] Birdies, birdies, birdies.

1:36:55.529 --> 1:36:57.649

1:36:57.649 --> 1:36:59.165
BIRDIES FOREVER!

1:36:59.165 --> 1:37:03.990
I am Jake fucking Baxter and I am BACK!

1:37:03.990 --> 1:37:06.151
Wooohooo!

1:37:06.151 --> 1:37:09.350
Nick, hand me that motherfucking two-

1:37:09.350 --> 1:37:10.183
That's exactly what I wanted.

1:37:10.183 --> 1:37:11.016
How'd you know?

1:37:11.016 --> 1:37:11.862
(Nick laughs)

1:37:11.862 --> 1:37:13.746
Win or lose, that's cool
that you know I was gonna...

1:37:13.746 --> 1:37:14.579
That's pretty cool.

1:37:14.579 --> 1:37:15.412
[Nick] Right right, we're- yeah!

1:37:15.412 --> 1:37:16.330
Here we go.

1:37:21.170 --> 1:37:22.800
[Marvin] It's a beautiful shot.

1:37:22.800 --> 1:37:26.470
That is a sniper shot,
the best I've ever seen.

1:37:26.470 --> 1:37:28.890
[Pop] Damn it's a SNIPER SHOT!

1:37:28.890 --> 1:37:30.950
[Marvin] Could this even be possible?

1:37:30.950 --> 1:37:32.663
Has anyone ever?

1:37:33.541 --> 1:37:35.877
It's a hole in ONE

1:37:35.877 --> 1:37:37.293
I can't believe it!

1:37:37.293 --> 1:37:39.661
Jake Baxter just aced a par four!

1:37:39.661 --> 1:37:42.493
He need a Birdie but he got an albatross.

1:37:42.493 --> 1:37:44.671
[Pop] Yeah, my boy!

1:37:44.671 --> 1:37:49.462
[Marvin] Adrian Boyd is out of this match!

1:37:51.119 --> 1:37:53.952
(people cheering)

1:38:03.856 --> 1:38:04.856
Oh my God.

1:38:07.309 --> 1:38:10.142
(people cheering)

1:38:20.410 --> 1:38:24.023
Well, so I guess I work for you now.

1:38:27.160 --> 1:38:27.993
Partners?

1:38:29.660 --> 1:38:30.760
Something like that.

1:38:33.810 --> 1:38:35.888
I think you should probably kiss me now.

1:38:35.888 --> 1:38:37.150
Oh yeah.
- Yeah.

1:38:38.980 --> 1:38:40.210
Conroy, that was the fu-

1:38:40.210 --> 1:38:42.220
Oh my God, did not know
you guys are about to kiss.

1:38:42.220 --> 1:38:43.320
I am so sorry.

1:38:43.320 --> 1:38:44.160
Dude, I am so sorry.

1:38:44.160 --> 1:38:46.790
We weren't about to kiss, we were kissing.

1:38:46.790 --> 1:38:49.083
Thry were kissing.
I'll let it slide.

1:38:50.660 --> 1:38:53.360
I've never seen anything like that, Jake.

1:38:53.360 --> 1:38:54.463
You saved my ass.

1:38:56.310 --> 1:38:58.663
Yeah, I kinda did, didn't I?

1:38:59.498 --> 1:39:01.260
It's the best job I ever, dude.

1:39:01.260 --> 1:39:04.193
Anything you want, you got it.

1:39:04.193 --> 1:39:05.440
You're home now.

1:39:05.440 --> 1:39:06.890
You hear me, the both of you.

1:39:07.940 --> 1:39:10.263
Appreciate that, thank you Conroy.

1:39:12.173 --> 1:39:16.003
I guess I'll have my attorney
start to make arrangements.

1:39:16.950 --> 1:39:19.653
You got my number, I'll
expect keys in two weeks.

1:39:20.720 --> 1:39:22.480
I'm gonna call the motel,

1:39:22.480 --> 1:39:24.130
have 'em save our favorite suite.

1:39:25.040 --> 1:39:27.083
Not here, later, later.

1:39:28.660 --> 1:39:29.493
All right, yeah.

1:39:29.493 --> 1:39:31.370
I'll see you at Thanksgiving, Mr. Boyd.

1:39:31.370 --> 1:39:33.263
We don't have to talk about any of this.

1:39:35.170 --> 1:39:36.003
Adrian.

1:39:44.550 --> 1:39:48.090
Look, man, I still don't like you

1:39:50.035 --> 1:39:51.223
but, goddammit.

1:39:56.960 --> 1:39:57.793
You respect me?

1:39:57.793 --> 1:39:59.040
No, I realized soon as I said that,

1:39:59.040 --> 1:40:00.170
it sounded like I was gonna say respect.

1:40:00.170 --> 1:40:04.463
It was not, it's more like,
I think you're a good golfer.

1:40:12.084 --> 1:40:14.834
(birds chirping)

1:40:19.330 --> 1:40:22.420
Well, looks like you got a new club, boss.

1:40:22.420 --> 1:40:24.320
Yeah, don't get too excited.

1:40:24.320 --> 1:40:25.293
I might fuck it up.

1:40:26.300 --> 1:40:27.623
I'm not gonna!

1:40:49.208 --> 1:40:51.270
White people.

1:40:51.270 --> 1:40:53.670
So, when are we gonna work
on my putting game, huh?

1:40:53.670 --> 1:40:55.410
Oh, putting is not my department.

1:40:55.410 --> 1:40:57.520
I would defer to my short
game professor, Nick.

1:40:57.520 --> 1:40:58.353
He'll take it from here.

1:40:58.353 --> 1:40:59.420
Won't you follow me, Ms. Gladys.

1:40:59.420 --> 1:41:01.912
His putting sucks the ass.

1:41:01.912 --> 1:41:02.745
I'm working on it.

1:41:02.745 --> 1:41:03.578
Yeah okay.

1:41:03.578 --> 1:41:06.350
What the hell are we
gonna do about these guys?

1:41:06.350 --> 1:41:07.460
They can sleep it off.

1:41:07.460 --> 1:41:09.310
Yeah, I feel like we should
call the greens keepers.

1:41:09.310 --> 1:41:11.880
I feel like you're probably right.

1:41:11.880 --> 1:41:14.020
Hey greens, we could use a
clean up at the driving range.

1:41:14.020 --> 1:41:15.950
Got three naked dudes laying here.

1:41:15.950 --> 1:41:18.760
Copy clubhouse, Adrian is on his way.

1:41:18.760 --> 1:41:20.830
If you guys are talking
about my dad again,

1:41:20.830 --> 1:41:22.233
you can screw off!

1:41:23.450 --> 1:41:24.700
He's happy.

1:41:24.700 --> 1:41:26.426
Thank you very much.

1:41:26.426 --> 1:41:29.580
Do me a favor, when you're
done fixing that boys,

1:41:29.580 --> 1:41:31.180
come up here and fix this for me.

1:41:31.180 --> 1:41:32.013
Fix what?

1:41:36.366 --> 1:41:40.050
(golf cart buzzing)

1:41:40.050 --> 1:41:40.883
Hey what'd I miss?

1:41:40.883 --> 1:41:43.853
Oh, just another day at
Twin Pines, you know.

1:41:43.853 --> 1:41:44.686
I tell you what, I'm thirsty.

1:41:44.686 --> 1:41:46.740
I'll take a water 'cause I'm pregnant.

1:41:46.740 --> 1:41:47.790
Well, I mean we're pregnant.

1:41:47.790 --> 1:41:48.623
She's pregnant.

1:41:49.870 --> 1:41:51.253
Well, this round's on me.

1:41:52.534 --> 1:41:53.650
Thanks so much.

1:41:53.650 --> 1:41:54.483
Yeah.

1:41:55.639 --> 1:41:59.736
To Twin Pines, may the
tradition continue to continue.

1:41:59.736 --> 1:42:01.319
- [All] Twin Pines.
