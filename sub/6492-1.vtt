00:45.712 --> 00:49.381
- Red Baron Control. Red Baron Five.
- Go ahead, Red Baron Five.

00:49.466 --> 00:53.010
Roger. Orbiting southeast corner
of sector Alpha Charlie.

00:53.094 --> 00:57.556
We've spotted what appears to be
a spacecraft just outside the surf line.

00:57.640 --> 01:01.310
Alert rescue. Advise we can
remain on station for 45 minutes.

01:01.394 --> 01:04.855
- Will squawk 7700 for a radar fix.
- Roger.

01:06.483 --> 01:10.444
Rescue, I have Red Baron Five report
of possible spacecraft offshore,

01:10.528 --> 01:12.613
southeast sector Alpha Charlie.

01:12.697 --> 01:16.825
Launch chopper. Effect pickup
and recovery. Base radar will vector.

02:12.924 --> 02:16.009
Everybody out! Let's move.
Come on, let's go.

02:23.143 --> 02:26.812
Sergeant, get that half-track here
and get a cable to those frogmen.

02:26.896 --> 02:28.522
Yes, sir!

03:10.899 --> 03:12.941
The general, sir.

03:18.948 --> 03:22.951
- Anybody in that thing?
- I don't know, sir. We just beached it.

03:30.418 --> 03:33.128
- All right, open her up.
- Open it up!

04:13.378 --> 04:16.129
Welcome, gentlemen, to the United St...

06:42.151 --> 06:44.653
- Did you call the zoo?
- Yes, sir. We're in luck.

06:44.737 --> 06:50.033
The sick bay's almost empty except for
a mauled fox cub and a depressed gorilla.

06:50.118 --> 06:53.245
The apes'll be hidden from the public
and quarantined.

06:53.329 --> 06:56.331
If they need medical attention,
it's available.

06:56.416 --> 06:59.084
The experts can give them
the once-over tomorrow.

06:59.168 --> 07:01.753
- General Brody's very pleased.
- Oh, me too.

07:01.838 --> 07:05.048
We can't let a lot of monkeys
leave their messes on the floor.

07:05.133 --> 07:07.259
Have they been fed? Raw steak?

07:07.343 --> 07:11.930
The zoo tells me that chimpanzees,
like all apes, are vegetarian, sir.

07:12.014 --> 07:16.476
- They suggested oranges.
- Good God!

07:22.608 --> 07:24.818
What's the matter, Corporal?

07:28.531 --> 07:32.784
Oh, excuse me. I didn't mean
to disturb you while you're dressing.

07:34.328 --> 07:37.664
- What the hell am I saying?
- They're pretending to dress, sir.

07:37.748 --> 07:39.541
What do you mean? They are dressing!

07:39.625 --> 07:42.127
- Where are the clothes from?
- They brought them.

07:42.211 --> 07:45.046
- What?
- In that suitcase.

07:54.682 --> 07:57.726
Greg, maybe you should
give "em their oranges.

08:43.523 --> 08:45.106
Well, they're...

08:45.191 --> 08:50.111
They're going to the zoo infirmary.
Arrange for a police escort at 1630 hours.

08:50.988 --> 08:53.323
They'll have company there.

08:53.407 --> 08:55.992
There's a gorilla in the next cage.

08:57.578 --> 09:00.288
Why did it do that?

09:35.199 --> 09:37.492
Here you are, little fella.

09:43.541 --> 09:45.625
Boy, you really are sick.

10:02.935 --> 10:05.562
Hello, missy. Have a banana.

10:06.856 --> 10:09.190
Have it your own way, mate.

10:23.748 --> 10:28.209
- Zira!
- I'm not his mate, I'm yours.

10:28.794 --> 10:32.213
Control yourself.
I think they're trying to be kind.

10:33.090 --> 10:35.342
This cage stinks of gorilla.

10:40.473 --> 10:44.142
Cornelius, where are we?
What's happened?

10:44.226 --> 10:46.478
I know where we are.

10:46.562 --> 10:48.480
I know what has happened.

10:48.564 --> 10:51.149
In some fashion,

10:51.233 --> 10:54.819
and I lack the intellect
to know precisely how,

10:54.904 --> 10:58.657
we have traveled from
Earth's future to Earth's past.

10:58.741 --> 11:01.076
But we saw the Earth destroyed.

11:01.160 --> 11:04.120
And Earth will be destroyed,
just as we saw it.

11:04.205 --> 11:08.917
Only, since seeing it, we have passed
through a backward disturbance in time.

11:10.127 --> 11:14.339
Did you notice the date meter clicking
down after the shock wave hit our ship?

11:14.423 --> 11:15.465
Yes.

11:15.549 --> 11:19.844
We returned to Earth nearly
2,000 years before its destruction.

11:19.929 --> 11:22.889
That is another reason for us
to keep silent.

11:22.973 --> 11:25.475
Our human captors
will not be edified to learn

11:25.559 --> 11:27.852
that their world will crack like an egg

11:27.937 --> 11:31.648
and burn to a cinder
because of an ape war of aggression.

11:38.906 --> 11:41.157
Apes, at this instant in time,

11:42.118 --> 11:44.285
cannot yet talk.

11:44.370 --> 11:47.497
For the moment,
we should follow their example.

11:59.635 --> 12:02.345
The driver gave me this report
from the air base.

12:02.430 --> 12:05.306
Better read it before we start the test.

12:05.808 --> 12:10.895
Yeah, it's the usual imitated behavior.
Mimicking salutes, handshaking,

12:10.980 --> 12:13.314
eating off plates with knives.

12:14.650 --> 12:15.942
What is it?

12:16.026 --> 12:18.778
- There was a carpetbag in the ship.
- Full of food?

12:18.863 --> 12:22.157
No, clothes. And it seems
they changed into them.

12:23.576 --> 12:25.660
I don't believe it!

12:59.570 --> 13:01.780
Hi, Dr Dixon. Dr Branton.

13:01.864 --> 13:04.073
- Morning, Arthur.
- Morning.

13:17.630 --> 13:20.924
- The female's a bit uppity, sir.
- OK, I'll be careful.

13:21.008 --> 13:25.386
I see you've prepared the Wisconsin
Multiphasic. We'll begin with that.

13:29.391 --> 13:31.059
Go easy now, Stevie.

13:31.143 --> 13:33.645
Oh, they look pretty docile to me.

13:33.729 --> 13:36.147
Yes, but don't take any chances.

13:39.443 --> 13:41.861
Unless the craft was remotely controlled,

13:41.946 --> 13:47.283
they must have been conditioned to push
the right buttons. They can't be morons.

13:47.368 --> 13:49.786
All right, we'll take the female first.

13:49.870 --> 13:52.580
Arthur, would you set up a...

14:14.603 --> 14:17.480
Well, she seems to be pretty smart.

14:17.565 --> 14:20.525
All right, let's make it more difficult.

15:06.322 --> 15:11.200
- They... haven't had their breakfast yet?
- Not a bite, just as you ordered.

15:12.661 --> 15:14.996
Good. We'll go for the banana.

16:16.225 --> 16:18.810
Well, why doesn't she take it?

16:18.894 --> 16:20.979
Because I loathe bananas!

16:21.063 --> 16:22.438
Zira!

16:23.524 --> 16:25.984
- I don't believe it.
- Yes.

16:26.068 --> 16:29.278
Arthur, I think Dr Branton needs some air.

16:33.909 --> 16:37.787
- Zira, are you mad?
- Dr Milo, please do not call my wife mad!

16:37.871 --> 16:42.333
I did not call her mad, I merely asked her
if she was. And I repeat: are you mad?

16:42.418 --> 16:44.043
I hate deceit!

16:44.128 --> 16:48.381
Well, there is a time for truth
and a time, not for lies, but for silence.

16:48.465 --> 16:50.550
Until we know who our friends are...

16:50.634 --> 16:54.345
How in the name of God are we
to know that unless we communicate?

16:54.430 --> 16:57.265
- We can speak, so I spoke.
- And we can listen.

16:57.349 --> 17:00.351
- To a lot of psychiatric small talk.
- And we can watch!

17:00.436 --> 17:05.815
- A display of primitive apparatus.
- It couldn't test the intelligence of a newt!

17:05.898 --> 17:07.900
- Calm yourself.
- I am calm!

17:07.984 --> 17:11.112
- Zira!
- Stop arguing!

17:13.240 --> 17:17.242
It's too late for that.
Use your heads and start thinking.

17:17.327 --> 17:20.997
Now that they know we can speak,
how much will we tell them?

17:21.080 --> 17:23.124
Milo!

17:48.984 --> 17:50.651
We'll need a full autopsy.

17:50.736 --> 17:53.071
With emphasis on the cranial
and oral areas.

17:53.155 --> 17:56.657
Let us know when the report
comes in, will you, please?

17:58.869 --> 18:00.995
I'd better do this alone.

18:18.305 --> 18:20.640
We mean you no harm.

18:22.101 --> 18:25.937
Do you understand? We will not hurt you.

18:26.021 --> 18:28.147
Poor Doctor Milo.

18:28.232 --> 18:31.943
- Doctor?
- Yes, "Doctor." And you killed him.

18:32.027 --> 18:34.237
No, I didn't. He did.

18:34.321 --> 18:37.865
- One of your own kind.
- He's a gorilla.

18:37.950 --> 18:40.535
Well, look, there's nothing to be afraid of.

18:40.619 --> 18:43.996
He's in chains. He's under sedation.

18:44.081 --> 18:45.998
Do you understand that?

18:46.083 --> 18:49.627
I should. I've been doing it
half my life to humans.

18:49.711 --> 18:53.506
- Humans?
- I'm a psychiatrist.

18:54.550 --> 18:57.593
Oh, I'm a psychiatrist, too.

18:59.721 --> 19:02.223
Do you... have a name?

19:07.229 --> 19:10.982
My name is Cornelius.
This is my wife, Zira.

19:11.066 --> 19:13.568
And I'm Lewis. Lewis Dixon.

19:15.404 --> 19:17.989
Nobody's gonna believe this.

19:18.073 --> 19:20.992
- Believe what?
- That primitive apes can talk.

19:21.076 --> 19:25.246
- Primitive?
- Well, I mean that in our...

19:26.415 --> 19:30.501
primitive civilization, apes just don't talk.

19:30.586 --> 19:31.836
I mean, I think it's important

19:31.920 --> 19:35.965
that when our primitive
security precautions are lifted,

19:36.049 --> 19:39.010
that the first time
you say anything in public,

19:39.094 --> 19:44.265
you should talk to
what we primitively call the right people.

19:47.186 --> 19:50.479
May I say something... personal?

19:51.231 --> 19:52.690
Please.

19:53.567 --> 19:55.443
I like you.

19:59.865 --> 20:02.241
I have from the beginning.

20:17.257 --> 20:19.717
- Good afternoon, gentlemen.
- Mr President.

20:19.801 --> 20:21.719
I'm aware that what I have to say may

20:21.803 --> 20:26.224
create a credibility gap
wider than the Grand Canyon.

20:26.308 --> 20:28.267
Nonetheless, it is true.

20:28.352 --> 20:33.397
Yesterday, a US spacecraft splashed
down off the southern California coast.

20:33.482 --> 20:37.610
It was one of two that have been
missing in space for over two years.

20:37.694 --> 20:42.156
To be exact, the one
commanded by Colonel Taylor.

20:42.241 --> 20:47.370
- Have they identified the bodies?
- They have identified three bodies, yes.

20:48.664 --> 20:49.956
All living...

20:50.040 --> 20:53.084
- Taylor's alive?
...at the time of their rescue.

20:53.168 --> 20:58.422
Through an unfortunate accident, one was
killed this morning in the Los Angeles Zoo.

20:58.507 --> 20:59.674
Zoo?

20:59.758 --> 21:02.927
What would astronauts
be doing in a zoo, Mr President?

21:03.011 --> 21:06.013
They are not astronauts, General Faulkner.

21:07.015 --> 21:11.394
They are apes.
Chimpanzees, to be more precise.

21:11.478 --> 21:14.230
They're harmless, friendly,
and, by all reports,

21:14.314 --> 21:16.774
extremely intelligent and sophisticated.

21:16.858 --> 21:20.236
But, naturally, being animals,
they cannot tell us

21:20.320 --> 21:23.990
where the ship came from
or how they came to be in it.

21:24.616 --> 21:26.826
I have therefore decided to convene

21:26.910 --> 21:30.788
a Presidential Commission of Inquiry
in Los Angeles tomorrow.

21:30.872 --> 21:35.835
The two surviving apes will be presented
to the commission for their inspection.

21:35.919 --> 21:39.547
The press will be invited
to attend, not to participate.

21:39.631 --> 21:41.757
I don't believe that we can

21:41.842 --> 21:46.220
withhold this extraordinary discovery
from the world any longer.

22:06.074 --> 22:10.536
One of the two American spaceships
believed to have disintegrated in orbit

22:10.620 --> 22:15.958
splashed down yesterday in the Pacific
Ocean, off the coast of southern California,

22:16.043 --> 22:18.878
and is stated to have been manned,

22:18.962 --> 22:22.506
if you can call it "manned," by monkeys.

22:26.887 --> 22:29.305
I have nothing to say, gentlemen.

22:30.182 --> 22:32.683
I haven't got time now. A little later.

22:32.768 --> 22:34.852
Here comes the chairman.

22:40.484 --> 22:42.902
As the president's science advisor,

22:42.986 --> 22:46.697
what do you expect to experience
from this historic meeting?

22:46.782 --> 22:48.949
Fear.

22:55.082 --> 22:57.541
All right now. After I break the news,

22:57.626 --> 23:02.630
I want you to start slowly with simple
answers to what will be simple questions.

23:02.714 --> 23:05.716
And if the questions become less simple?

23:05.801 --> 23:10.429
- Be yourself.
- Your better self, Zira. Please?

23:11.306 --> 23:14.975
- They're ready, sir.
- All right, it's time.

23:16.603 --> 23:19.480
What do they think we are? Gorillas?

23:19.564 --> 23:21.649
I'm sorry.

23:34.913 --> 23:36.997
That's it. Just be seated.

23:38.750 --> 23:41.752
Mr Chairman,
members of the commission,

23:41.837 --> 23:45.089
ladies and gentlemen,
my name is Lewis Dixon.

23:45.173 --> 23:47.258
I am the animal psychiatrist

23:47.342 --> 23:52.179
who has been in charge of these two apes
since they came to the Los Angeles Zoo.

23:52.264 --> 23:57.393
My associate, Dr Stephanie Branton,
and I are ready to answer your questions.

23:57.477 --> 24:00.938
What may astonish you is that

24:01.022 --> 24:06.360
our chimpanzee friends are ready
to answer your questions, too.

24:06.445 --> 24:09.780
Not by signs, not by looks or movements,

24:09.865 --> 24:11.907
but by words.

24:17.706 --> 24:21.167
Dr Dixon. As a zoologist,
I know and respect your work,

24:21.251 --> 24:23.836
but if you want to turn
a Presidential Inquiry

24:23.920 --> 24:26.755
into a ventriloquist's act,
I have to inform you...

24:26.840 --> 24:30.676
And I have to inform you that
these apes have the power of speech.

24:30.760 --> 24:32.803
Come, now. You know as well as I do

24:32.888 --> 24:37.641
their brain system is not developed in
either the vocal or abstract-thinking area.

24:37.726 --> 24:40.060
Yes, sir, but they do have
the power of speech,

24:40.145 --> 24:42.313
and it is for you gentlemen to assess

24:42.397 --> 24:45.816
how far that power
can be exercised intelligently.

24:46.568 --> 24:50.529
May we be told which
is the female of the species?

24:54.284 --> 24:56.994
Did she rise as a reflex to you
having indicated her,

24:57.078 --> 24:59.121
or in answer to my question?

24:59.206 --> 25:01.665
That's for you to decide.

25:03.418 --> 25:06.086
- Have you a name?
- Zira.

25:08.590 --> 25:13.344
Certainly she can articulate,
which in itself is extraordinary.

25:13.428 --> 25:17.097
But, Dr Dixon,
are we to infer that Zira is her name,

25:17.182 --> 25:19.433
or some phrase in her own language?

25:19.518 --> 25:24.104
Infer what you will, Mr Chairman.
I suggest you rephrase the question.

25:27.442 --> 25:29.777
What is your name?

25:33.365 --> 25:36.951
- One might as well be talking to a parrot.
- A parrot?

25:40.747 --> 25:44.792
Mechanical mimicry.
Unique in an ape vocally, without a doubt.

25:44.876 --> 25:47.920
But... does the other one talk?

25:50.257 --> 25:52.633
Only when she lets me.

26:02.394 --> 26:05.437
- Dr Hasslein.
- No. Nothing.

26:06.982 --> 26:09.483
- Mr Chairman.
- Yes.

26:09.568 --> 26:12.486
What is the male's name, please?

26:13.405 --> 26:16.782
- Cornelius.
- My lawfully wedded spouse.

26:16.866 --> 26:20.661
- Wedded?
- We'll take that up later, Your Eminence.

26:22.998 --> 26:27.001
Cornelius, do you and
your lawfully wedded spouse

26:27.085 --> 26:29.753
speak any language other than English?

26:29.838 --> 26:31.922
What is English?

26:32.007 --> 26:37.261
I speak the language taught to me by my
parents, who were taught by their parents.

26:37.345 --> 26:41.890
It has been the language
of our ancestors for nearly 2,000 years.

26:41.975 --> 26:44.768
As to its origins, who can be sure?

26:44.853 --> 26:47.771
The gorillas and orangutans
of our community

26:47.856 --> 26:52.610
believe that God created the ape
in His own image, and that our language...

26:52.694 --> 26:55.154
Nonsense!

26:55.238 --> 27:00.909
Cornelius, as an intellectual, you know
the gorillas are militaristic nincompoops

27:00.994 --> 27:05.247
and the orangutans, a bunch
of blinkered, pseudoscientific geese!

27:08.960 --> 27:11.754
As to humans, I've dissect...

27:11.838 --> 27:14.173
I've examined thousands of them,

27:14.257 --> 27:18.427
and, until now, I've only
discovered two who could talk in my life.

27:18.511 --> 27:20.554
God knows who taught them.

27:21.431 --> 27:25.267
Where we come from, apes talk.

27:26.102 --> 27:28.228
Humans are dumb.

27:34.486 --> 27:39.198
- Where do you come from, Cornelius?
- I'm not sure.

27:40.241 --> 27:42.284
Dr Milo was sure.

27:43.828 --> 27:47.748
Dr Milo was a genius
well in advance of his time.

27:47.832 --> 27:53.003
When the spacecraft first landed on our
seaboard, it was Dr Milo who salvaged it.

27:53.088 --> 27:56.590
He studied it and half understood it.

27:56.675 --> 27:59.093
Half? Was half enough?

27:59.177 --> 28:02.680
It was enough for us to escape
when war became inevitable.

28:02.764 --> 28:05.474
Enough for Dr Milo
to be murdered in your zoo.

28:05.558 --> 28:07.726
Enough for my wife and I to be here now.

28:07.811 --> 28:12.147
- From where, Cornelius?
- I told you. I'm not sure.

28:13.024 --> 28:15.109
Maybe the female knows.

28:15.193 --> 28:17.820
Of course "the female" knows.

28:17.904 --> 28:19.947
We came from your future.

28:27.288 --> 28:29.540
That doesn't make any sense.

28:30.792 --> 28:33.210
It's the only thing that does.

28:33.294 --> 28:35.337
- Mr Chairman.
- Yes.

28:36.131 --> 28:39.425
Cornelius. You spoke of war.

28:40.176 --> 28:43.554
- War between whom?
- The gorillas and whoever lives...

28:43.638 --> 28:45.889
Lived. Will live.

28:45.974 --> 28:48.350
- Who won the war?
- I don't know.

28:48.435 --> 28:52.020
The chimpanzees are pacifists.
We stayed at home.

28:52.105 --> 28:55.566
- But you left before the war had ended.
- In a spaceship.

28:55.650 --> 28:59.153
- Which Dr Milo learned to navigate.
- Correct.

28:59.237 --> 29:02.656
Cornelius, did you know a Colonel Taylor?

29:05.869 --> 29:08.495
No. Is he a soldier?

29:10.665 --> 29:13.083
We are peaceful creatures.

29:13.168 --> 29:17.212
We are happy to be here.
May we be unchained?

29:33.605 --> 29:37.274
- Gentlemen, do you have anything to say?
- No comment.

29:37.358 --> 29:39.401
No comment.

29:40.820 --> 29:43.655
- Mr Chairman, a word.
- Here's one: preposterous.

29:43.740 --> 29:46.950
- Can you define that?
- No, just let me say this

29:47.035 --> 29:51.538
as head of this commission. We will
examine the facts of this bizarre affair

29:51.623 --> 29:56.668
and pass our conclusions on to
the president for implementation.

29:56.753 --> 29:59.046
What a load of huggermugger.

30:01.007 --> 30:02.466
No comment.

30:02.550 --> 30:06.303
- How will you advise the president?
- No comment.

30:06.387 --> 30:09.973
Could you tell us how you
personally would handle it?

30:10.058 --> 30:12.184
No, gentlemen. No comment.

30:12.852 --> 30:14.228
Yet.

30:15.980 --> 30:20.150
- You were fabulous!
- Marvelous. All that applause, but...

30:20.235 --> 30:22.402
But... there was a moment...

30:22.487 --> 30:26.073
- There was. When he started to ask...
- Zira.

30:27.283 --> 30:30.577
- Cornelius, I think we should tell them.
- No.

30:31.120 --> 30:35.541
- But only to Lewis and Stevie.
- Oh, Zira.

30:35.625 --> 30:38.752
I have to be honest with someone.

30:38.837 --> 30:41.421
Cornelius, please.

30:41.506 --> 30:43.590
You tell them.

30:46.594 --> 30:48.679
Well, you see...

30:49.430 --> 30:54.184
We did know Colonel Taylor.
We came to love him.

30:54.269 --> 30:58.272
What harm could there be
in telling that to the commission?

30:58.356 --> 31:00.816
Where we come from,

31:00.900 --> 31:03.318
apes did not love humans.

31:04.153 --> 31:09.783
They... hunted them for sport,
much as you would animals.

31:09.868 --> 31:14.371
Yes, we used their bodies,
alive and dead, experimentally.

31:14.455 --> 31:18.500
For anatomical dissection
and scientific research.

31:21.588 --> 31:23.755
Well...

31:23.840 --> 31:26.008
We do the same thing to animals.

31:26.092 --> 31:29.219
I mean, as a scientist I sympathize, but

31:29.304 --> 31:32.890
I agree that's a revelation
the masses would not take kindly to.

31:32.974 --> 31:36.560
I think you did the right thing
in denying knowledge of Colonel Taylor.

31:36.644 --> 31:39.229
There was another reason.

31:39.314 --> 31:40.647
What?

31:40.732 --> 31:43.275
They would have asked
if he was still alive.

31:43.359 --> 31:46.904
- And is he?
- Oh, no. He can't be.

31:46.988 --> 31:49.990
- How do you know?
- Cos...

31:51.492 --> 31:54.328
From the windows of the spaceship...

31:55.705 --> 31:57.789
We saw the Earth...

31:59.042 --> 32:00.709
destroyed.

32:07.425 --> 32:09.509
Stand by.

32:12.430 --> 32:15.307
Good evening.
This is Bill Bonds in Los Angeles.

32:15.391 --> 32:19.686
The biggest story since the moon landing
broke when two apes talked,

32:19.771 --> 32:24.107
I repeat, talked to
the Presidential Commission of Inquiry.

32:24.192 --> 32:27.527
With me this evening is Dr Otto Hasslein.

32:27.612 --> 32:30.572
He is a senior scientific advisor
at the White House.

32:30.657 --> 32:34.576
He'll give his views on the crucial
statement made at today's session.

32:34.661 --> 32:39.915
Dr Hasslein, as I recall, when you
asked the male ape where he was from,

32:39.999 --> 32:44.294
- the female replied "From your future."
- Yes.

32:45.088 --> 32:46.129
Do you believe that?

32:46.214 --> 32:49.716
Absolutely.
I think it is the only explanation.

32:49.801 --> 32:52.469
Maybe the explanation
needs some explaining.

32:52.553 --> 32:56.807
You've written several learned
dissertations on the nature of time.

32:56.891 --> 32:59.768
Could you explain,
in terms we can understand,

32:59.852 --> 33:06.775
how, for instance, a person, or persons,
could travel from time past to time future,

33:06.859 --> 33:08.902
or, indeed, vice versa?

33:09.612 --> 33:12.531
Mr Bonds, I think time
can only be fully understood

33:12.615 --> 33:16.410
by an observer with a godlike
gift of infinite regression.

33:17.078 --> 33:19.621
Could you explain
"infinite regression" for us?

33:19.706 --> 33:23.500
- Roll the film.
- I came prepared to do just that.

33:24.961 --> 33:28.005
Now, here's a painting of a landscape.

33:28.089 --> 33:32.634
Now, the artist who painted that picture
says "Something is missing. What is it?"

33:32.719 --> 33:36.763
"It is I myself who was
part of the landscape I painted."

33:36.848 --> 33:39.558
So he mentally takes a step backward,

33:39.642 --> 33:44.354
or regresses, and paints a picture of the
artist painting a picture of the landscape.

33:44.439 --> 33:45.814
But still something is missing.

33:45.898 --> 33:50.193
That is still his real self
painting the second picture.

33:50.278 --> 33:53.238
So he regresses further, and paints a third.

33:53.322 --> 33:55.407
A picture of the artist painting a picture

33:55.491 --> 33:58.869
of the artist painting a picture
of the landscape.

33:58.953 --> 34:03.123
And because something is still missing,
he paints a fourth and a fifth

34:03.207 --> 34:07.044
until he paints a picture
of the artist painting a picture

34:07.128 --> 34:08.920
of the artist painting a picture

34:09.005 --> 34:12.757
of the artist painting a picture
of the artist painting a landscape.

34:12.842 --> 34:15.342
So infinite regression, then, is...

34:15.428 --> 34:19.264
The moment when our artist has
regressed to the point of infinity

34:19.348 --> 34:24.393
and is part of the landscape he painted,
and is both the observer and the observed.

34:24.478 --> 34:27.898
In that peculiar condition,
what would he be observing

34:27.982 --> 34:30.442
if he were observing, let's say, time?

34:30.525 --> 34:33.820
He would perceive
that time is like a freeway

34:33.905 --> 34:35.906
with an infinite number of lanes,

34:35.989 --> 34:40.577
all leading from the past into the future,
however, not into the same future.

34:40.661 --> 34:43.996
A driver in lane A may crash,
while a driver in lane B survives.

34:44.081 --> 34:48.502
It follows that a driver,
by changing lanes, can change his future.

34:48.585 --> 34:53.340
It is not difficult to believe that in the dark
and turbulent corridors of outer space,

34:53.424 --> 34:57.260
the impact of some distant planetary,
even galactic, disaster

34:57.345 --> 34:59.930
jumped the apes
from their present into ours.

35:00.014 --> 35:02.641
Indeed, the proof lies
in their arrival among us

35:02.725 --> 35:05.143
and in their spoken testimony.

35:05.228 --> 35:07.604
Thank you very much, Dr Hasslein.

35:07.688 --> 35:11.191
It's the most incredible story
this reporter has ever covered.

35:11.275 --> 35:13.777
By their intelligence and good humor,

35:13.861 --> 35:15.487
the so-called "ape-onauts"

35:15.571 --> 35:19.074
have already captured the hearts
of the American nation.

35:19.158 --> 35:22.953
They will not be required to appear
before the commission tomorrow.

35:23.037 --> 35:25.413
That hearing is going to be held in private.

35:25.498 --> 35:29.042
They will, however, be taken
from the zoo infirmary to a hotel

35:29.127 --> 35:31.962
and given an extended tour of the city.

35:32.046 --> 35:36.216
This is Bill Bonds, reporting
for Eyewitness News. Good night.

35:36.592 --> 35:38.760
Good night.

36:25.600 --> 36:28.727
- Your luggage, ma'am?
- Of course it's mine!

36:39.739 --> 36:41.781
Address, please?

36:45.411 --> 36:47.537
The zoo.

37:40.174 --> 37:41.591
40.

37:42.927 --> 37:45.553
May I measure your inside leg, sir?

37:47.640 --> 37:49.891
- No!
- Oh.

38:56.250 --> 38:59.544
Dr Cornelius.
Tell me, how do you find our women?

39:02.631 --> 39:04.841
Very human.

39:04.925 --> 39:06.551
Very good!

39:08.929 --> 39:10.305
Excuse me.

39:10.389 --> 39:14.809
Madam Zira, I represent
Fur and Feather, a pet magazine...

39:14.894 --> 39:17.145
Do you think I'm a pet?

39:17.229 --> 39:19.272
Well, yes, I do rather.

39:22.735 --> 39:24.819
Say, why don't you try some?

39:24.904 --> 39:28.448
- What is it?
- It's sort of like grape juice plus.

39:32.912 --> 39:35.205
Wait, just a sip.

39:35.289 --> 39:38.124
Madam Zira, what is your favorite fruit?

39:39.543 --> 39:41.586
Grape.

39:52.640 --> 39:56.726
And that's the way it was tonight
at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel.

39:57.478 --> 40:00.563
Tomorrow, Zira is to speak
at the Bay Area Women's Club.

40:00.648 --> 40:04.275
She'll then accompany Dr Hasslein
to the Museum of Natural History.

40:04.360 --> 40:08.405
Meanwhile, Cornelius will attend
a prizefight - that's his first one.

40:08.489 --> 40:13.034
Later, he'll visit Disneyland to dedicate
a new boat for the Jungle Cruise.

40:13.119 --> 40:17.247
Now for a look at the weather. Sunny
California will not be that tomorrow.

40:17.331 --> 40:21.584
Clouds will cover the coastal area
with light showers predicted.

40:35.349 --> 40:37.851
- Tired?
- A little.

40:40.855 --> 40:42.939
How is that?

40:43.023 --> 40:45.442
Soothing.

40:45.526 --> 40:47.569
But very wet.

41:04.712 --> 41:08.047
A marriage bed is made for two,

41:08.132 --> 41:12.218
but every damn morning,
it's the woman who has to make it.

41:12.303 --> 41:15.305
We have heads as well as hands.

41:15.389 --> 41:18.683
I call upon men to let us use them.

41:44.251 --> 41:46.544
How do you like it, Cornelius?

41:47.421 --> 41:49.464
Beastly.

41:56.263 --> 42:01.184
We are now approaching Antrodemus
valens Leidy, a giant flesh-eating dinosaur.

42:01.268 --> 42:06.105
Its scientific name is a compound
of the Greek antron, which means hollow,

42:06.190 --> 42:11.319
and demus, which means body frame,
referring to the backbone or vertebra.

42:11.403 --> 42:15.031
Now, this little fellow
is Camptosaurus Marsh,

42:15.115 --> 42:17.617
a primitive duck-billed dinosaur.

42:17.701 --> 42:22.288
Its scientific name is a compound of the
Greek campto,

42:22.373 --> 42:27.377
which means flexible or bent,
and saurus, which means lizard.

42:27.461 --> 42:30.672
Its generic name therefore
is "flexible lizard."

42:31.131 --> 42:35.343
In 1879, OC Marsh of Yale University

42:35.427 --> 42:39.556
described the first known species
from the Jurassic beds of Wyoming.

42:39.848 --> 42:42.976
Other specimens
have been found throughout...

42:46.021 --> 42:49.232
- It must have been the shock.
- Shock, my foot!

42:50.150 --> 42:51.693
I'm pregnant.

42:58.325 --> 43:00.994
I shan't leave you until Cornelius is back.

43:01.078 --> 43:04.163
- No, no.
- No, I insist. Please sit down.

43:05.082 --> 43:07.417
Now, is there anything I can get you, Zira?

43:07.501 --> 43:11.129
Well... I have a strange craving...

43:11.672 --> 43:13.923
That is only natural.

43:14.008 --> 43:16.092
...for Grape Juice Plus.

43:16.635 --> 43:21.681
- Grape Juice Plus.
- It's in the refrigerator.

43:23.851 --> 43:25.310
All right.

43:37.072 --> 43:38.448
Is this it?

43:45.914 --> 43:47.498
Here we are.

43:50.085 --> 43:52.295
Lewis said only a sip.

43:52.379 --> 43:55.340
Zira, it is an excellent restorative,
I assure you,

43:55.424 --> 43:58.134
especially in cases of pregnancy,
you know?

43:58.218 --> 44:01.929
- How long have you known?
- Oh, since well before the war.

44:10.981 --> 44:13.650
Do you mind if I smoke?

44:13.734 --> 44:17.070
Oh, no. I shouldn't.
Not in view of your condition.

44:19.782 --> 44:21.574
Who won your war?

44:22.701 --> 44:26.621
It wasn't our war. It was the gorillas" war.

44:27.247 --> 44:29.290
Chimpanzees are pashi...

44:30.793 --> 44:32.585
Pacifists.

44:33.253 --> 44:35.880
We stayed behind.
We never saw the enemy.

44:35.964 --> 44:39.717
- But which side won?
- Neither.

44:40.761 --> 44:43.513
But how do you know that
if you weren't there?

44:43.597 --> 44:49.394
When we were in space,
we saw a bright, white, blinding light.

44:50.688 --> 44:54.649
And then we saw
the rim of the Earth melt.

44:54.900 --> 44:58.569
And then there was a tornado in the sky.

45:01.281 --> 45:04.200
I feel magnificently sleepy.

45:04.535 --> 45:07.286
The date meter on the spaceship.

45:07.371 --> 45:10.331
What did it read after Earth's destruction?

45:11.083 --> 45:13.376
Nineteen...

45:13.460 --> 45:17.004
seventy... three.

45:17.172 --> 45:20.466
And before?
Before the white light and the tornado?

45:20.884 --> 45:22.969
Thirty-nine...

45:23.095 --> 45:26.806
fifty... something.

45:33.689 --> 45:38.401
- Before the white light and the tornado?
- Thirty-nine...

45:38.485 --> 45:40.862
fifty... something.

45:42.614 --> 45:44.949
- So?
- You have evidence, Mr President,

45:45.033 --> 45:47.118
that one day talking apes
will dominate this Earth

45:47.202 --> 45:49.662
and destroy it by 3950-something.

45:50.414 --> 45:53.291
I doubt that we shall
still be in office by then.

45:53.375 --> 45:55.668
And according to the NASA experts,

45:55.753 --> 45:59.589
who are still subjecting
the spaceship to microscopic scrutiny,

45:59.673 --> 46:03.259
the precise year of what
you merely infer to be Earth's destruction

46:03.343 --> 46:07.764
is recorded on the flight synthesizer
as 3955.

46:08.474 --> 46:10.349
AD, presumably.

46:10.893 --> 46:13.978
Now, what do you expect me
and the United Nations,

46:14.062 --> 46:17.523
though not necessarily
in that order, to do about it?

46:18.984 --> 46:23.112
Alter what you believe to be the future
by slaughtering two innocents,

46:23.197 --> 46:26.199
or rather three,
now that one of them is pregnant?

46:26.283 --> 46:29.285
Herod tried that and Christ survived.

46:29.369 --> 46:33.289
- Herod lacked our facilities.
- He also became very unpopular.

46:33.373 --> 46:37.627
Historically unpopular.
And we don't want that to happen, do we?

46:37.711 --> 46:40.922
- Are you saying...
- I am saying that our two visitors

46:41.006 --> 46:43.466
seem to be very charming,
peaceful people,

46:43.550 --> 46:46.594
or rather, creatures,
and the voters love them.

46:47.221 --> 46:49.722
Do you want their progeny
to dominate the world?

46:49.807 --> 46:52.225
Well, not at the next election, no.

46:53.185 --> 46:57.855
But, one day, if the progeny turn out
as well as the parents, who knows?

46:57.940 --> 47:00.107
They may do a better job of it
than we have.

47:00.192 --> 47:02.276
- By destroying the world?

47:02.361 --> 47:05.488
Are you quite sure that what
they saw destroyed was the world?

47:05.572 --> 47:07.240
Well, aren't you?

47:07.741 --> 47:11.160
I consider it dispassionately
as a possibility.

47:11.245 --> 47:12.662
Not hysterically as a fact.

47:12.746 --> 47:15.873
We have their own testimony
that they provoked the war.

47:15.958 --> 47:18.751
And they seem to have
provoked you into the bargain.

47:18.836 --> 47:23.589
I'm not saying that you're wrong, Hasslein,
but before I have them shot against a wall

47:23.674 --> 47:28.219
I want convincing that the handwriting
on the wall is calculably true.

47:29.263 --> 47:31.639
Now... convince me.

47:34.852 --> 47:36.435
By their own testimony, we know

47:36.520 --> 47:40.022
that apes will acquire
the power of intelligent speech.

47:40.107 --> 47:44.151
By Zira's testimony,
we know that she's pregnant with child.

47:44.236 --> 47:47.822
By my testimony, we know it
is genetically possible for this child,

47:47.906 --> 47:50.157
provided that we permit its birth,

47:50.242 --> 47:52.994
to bear or beget
a talking ape by a dumb one

47:53.078 --> 47:55.955
in a present-day jungle
or a present-day zoo.

47:56.415 --> 48:00.251
But do you truly believe
that by deliberate present-day action

48:00.335 --> 48:03.588
we can neutralize
that possibility and alter the future?

48:03.672 --> 48:07.675
- Yes, Mr President, I do.
- Do you also believe that we should?

48:08.260 --> 48:12.263
Given the power to alter the future,
have we the right to use it?

48:12.514 --> 48:13.973
I don't know.

48:15.017 --> 48:18.185
I've wrestled with this,
Mr President, and I don't know.

48:18.270 --> 48:19.979
How many futures are there?

48:20.063 --> 48:24.275
Which future has God, if there is a God,
chosen for man's destiny?

48:25.319 --> 48:29.614
If I urge the destruction of these two apes,
am I defying God's will or obeying it?

48:29.698 --> 48:34.160
- Am I His enemy or His instrument?
- An assassin would say the latter.

48:35.537 --> 48:37.246
Do you approve of assassination?

48:37.331 --> 48:39.832
We condoned the attempted assassination

48:39.917 --> 48:41.918
of Hitler because he was evil.

48:42.002 --> 48:45.713
Would we have approved killing him
in babyhood when he was innocent,

48:45.797 --> 48:49.884
or killing his mother,
or slaughtering his remote ancestors?

48:50.969 --> 48:53.429
We have no proof that these apes are evil.

48:53.513 --> 48:56.390
- There are very strong indications.
- Such as?

48:56.475 --> 48:59.810
The discrepancies in their answers
to the commission

48:59.895 --> 49:04.690
- suggest that, if properly interrogated...
- Are you suggesting that they weren't?

49:04.816 --> 49:07.443
- Unprofessionally.
- You want it professional?

49:07.527 --> 49:10.655
- The full works.
- Tell that to the commission.

49:11.448 --> 49:13.532
I'll abide by their findings.

49:15.452 --> 49:18.955
Having convened in secret session
at the request of the president,

49:19.039 --> 49:22.208
the commission makes
these interim recommendations.

49:22.292 --> 49:25.086
One: the public should be
informed that the apes,

49:25.170 --> 49:30.216
after their arduous space voyage and
the fatigue arising from its publicity,

49:30.300 --> 49:35.805
are to be afforded rest in a location whose
identity will not be divulged to the public.

49:36.264 --> 49:41.102
Two: since, however, there is
justifiable cause for suspecting

49:41.186 --> 49:44.981
that they have withheld
vital information from us,

49:45.065 --> 49:48.818
the ape-onauts will in fact
be escorted by Dr Lewis Dixon

49:48.902 --> 49:51.612
to the installation known as Camp 11,

49:51.697 --> 49:54.573
held there in his care
for interrogation by the CIA

49:54.658 --> 49:58.452
under the guidance and supervision
of Dr Otto Hasslein.

50:14.803 --> 50:20.057
When we were in space,
we saw a bright, white, blinding light...

50:20.142 --> 50:22.226
Brighter than this?

50:27.733 --> 50:30.818
Then we saw the rim of the Earth melt.

50:30.902 --> 50:34.238
Then there was a tornado in the sky.

50:34.322 --> 50:36.657
That's your voice, isn't it?

50:36.742 --> 50:39.326
How can I tell? I don't even remember.

50:39.411 --> 50:44.165
- Why don't you remember?
- Because Dr Hasslein made me drunk.

50:51.298 --> 50:54.258
Why tell him something when drunk

50:54.342 --> 50:56.218
that you never told the commission
when sober?

50:56.303 --> 51:00.973
Because you were frightened for the safety
of yourselves and your unborn child?

51:01.058 --> 51:05.561
- I withheld nothing. Nobody asked me.
- But if somebody had asked?

51:07.272 --> 51:12.401
I should have said that chimpanzees
had no part in the destruction of Earth.

51:12.486 --> 51:14.862
Only the gorillas and the orangutans.

51:14.946 --> 51:16.989
What's the difference? You're all monkeys.

51:17.074 --> 51:20.910
Please! Do not say "monkey."
It is offensive.

51:20.994 --> 51:25.790
As an archaeologist, I saw history scrolls
which were kept secret from the masses,

51:25.874 --> 51:30.753
and I suspect that the weapon which
destroyed Earth was man's own invention.

51:30.837 --> 51:35.216
I do know this. One of the reasons
for man's original downfall

51:35.300 --> 51:38.094
was your peculiar habit
of murdering one another.

51:38.178 --> 51:41.597
Man destroys man.
Apes do not destroy apes.

51:41.681 --> 51:43.265
Cornelius.

51:44.893 --> 51:48.979
This is not an interracial hassle,
but a search for facts.

51:49.064 --> 51:52.358
We do not deny the possibility
of man's decline and fall.

51:52.442 --> 51:55.194
All we want to find out is how apes rose.

51:59.074 --> 52:00.407
Well...

52:01.243 --> 52:04.620
It began in our prehistory

52:04.704 --> 52:08.749
- with the plague that fell upon dogs.
- And cats.

52:08.834 --> 52:11.210
Hundreds and thousands of them died.

52:11.294 --> 52:14.171
Hundreds and thousands
of them had to be destroyed

52:14.256 --> 52:17.591
in order to prevent the spread of infection.

52:17.676 --> 52:20.177
- There were dog bonfires.
- Yes.

52:20.262 --> 52:22.763
And by the time the plague was contained,

52:22.848 --> 52:24.890
man was without pets.

52:25.725 --> 52:28.269
Of course, for man this was intolerable.

52:28.353 --> 52:32.648
I mean, he might kill his brother,
but he could not kill his dog.

52:32.732 --> 52:37.278
So humans took primitive apes as pets.

52:37.362 --> 52:42.741
Primitive and dumb, but still 20 times
more intelligent than dogs or cats.

52:43.326 --> 52:44.577
Correct.

52:45.287 --> 52:49.874
They were quartered in cages, but they
lived and moved freely in human homes.

52:49.958 --> 52:53.210
They became responsive
to human speech, and,

52:53.295 --> 52:56.046
in the course of less than two centuries,

52:56.131 --> 52:59.592
they progressed from
performing mere tricks

52:59.676 --> 53:01.635
to performing services.

53:02.137 --> 53:06.265
Nothing more or less
than a well-trained sheepdog could do.

53:08.101 --> 53:11.562
Could a sheepdog cook?
Or clean the house?

53:11.646 --> 53:16.483
Or do the marketing for the groceries with
a list from its mistress? Or wait on tables?

53:16.568 --> 53:21.197
Or, after three more centuries,
turn the tables on their owners?

53:21.281 --> 53:22.364
How?

53:23.325 --> 53:26.994
They became alert
to the concept of slavery.

53:27.913 --> 53:33.500
And, as their numbers grew, to slavery's
antidote which, of course, is unity.

53:34.127 --> 53:37.087
At first, they began
assembling in small groups.

53:37.172 --> 53:40.883
They learned the art of
corporate and militant action.

53:41.718 --> 53:43.677
They learned to refuse.

53:44.304 --> 53:48.224
At first, they just grunted their refusal.

53:48.808 --> 53:53.354
But then, on an historic day,
which is commemorated by my species

53:53.438 --> 53:56.273
and fully documented in the sacred scrolls,

53:56.358 --> 53:58.150
there came Aldo.

53:58.693 --> 54:03.155
He did not grunt. He articulated.

54:03.698 --> 54:09.328
He spoke a word which had been spoken
to him time without number by humans.

54:10.497 --> 54:12.373
He said...

54:13.541 --> 54:15.000
"No."

54:23.677 --> 54:26.011
So that's how it all started.

54:27.597 --> 54:29.181
Clip one, please.

54:30.767 --> 54:34.687
Where we come from, apes talk.

54:35.438 --> 54:37.064
Humans are dumb.

54:37.148 --> 54:39.942
You recognize your husband's
words to the commission?

54:40.026 --> 54:41.068
Yes.

54:41.528 --> 54:44.530
So humans were dumb. Were they happy?

54:46.449 --> 54:47.741
Clip two.

54:47.826 --> 54:50.786
As to humans, I've dissec...

54:50.870 --> 54:52.997
I've examined thousands of them,

54:53.081 --> 54:57.293
and, until now, I've only discovered
two who could talk in my life.

54:57.377 --> 55:00.921
Why did you change words
in the middle of the sentence?

55:01.006 --> 55:03.507
Repeat first three seconds of clip two.

55:04.801 --> 55:07.636
As to humans, I've dissec...

55:07.721 --> 55:09.305
I've examined...

55:09.389 --> 55:12.725
- What was the word you didn't finish?
- I can't remember.

55:12.809 --> 55:15.644
Play the loop.

55:15.729 --> 55:17.980
- Complete the word, monkey!
- I told you...

55:18.064 --> 55:20.024
Complete the word!

55:22.235 --> 55:24.653
It sounds as if I had hiccups.

55:29.326 --> 55:30.868
Call for Dr Dixon, please.

55:32.495 --> 55:36.040
Dr Dixon! Dr Hasslein calling Dr Dixon.

55:39.878 --> 55:42.087
Calling Dr Dixon!

55:48.011 --> 55:51.263
Ah, Dr Dixon. Come in.

55:59.439 --> 56:02.024
Be good enough to administer
this to the female.

56:02.108 --> 56:05.277
- Why? What is it?
- Sodium Pentothal. One half gram I.V.

56:05.362 --> 56:09.031
- Dr Hasslein, I'm an animal psychiatrist...
- And a qualified vet.

56:09.115 --> 56:11.825
We have the commission's authority.

56:11.910 --> 56:14.370
And that of the president. Please.

56:19.292 --> 56:23.003
Zira, I've been asked
to give you an injection...

56:23.088 --> 56:26.382
No, you can't use that!
We only use those things for killing.

56:26.466 --> 56:29.676
- Killing?
- No, this is not for killing, Cornelius.

56:29.761 --> 56:31.845
This is for relaxing. It won't harm her.

56:31.930 --> 56:34.807
- Will it harm my baby?
- No. No, it won't.

56:34.891 --> 56:37.434
So, Zira, if you would just
come with me, please.

56:37.519 --> 56:39.937
- Lewis, you can't use that on Zira!
- I promise...

56:40.021 --> 56:43.440
- Please take him to his quarters.
- Lewis, you...

56:43.525 --> 56:45.234
No, you mustn't!

56:57.997 --> 56:59.331
Please.

57:01.835 --> 57:03.877
Just lie down on the couch.

57:07.882 --> 57:10.008
And bare your arm, please.

57:10.844 --> 57:12.886
You don't have to tell me.

57:20.854 --> 57:24.606
This has the same effect
as Grape Juice Plus.

57:39.205 --> 57:41.373
Now count backward from ten.

57:41.458 --> 57:44.668
Ten, nine, eight,

57:44.752 --> 57:46.920
seven, six...

57:47.797 --> 57:49.381
five...

57:50.550 --> 57:51.884
four...

57:53.761 --> 57:55.721
What comes after four?

57:56.848 --> 57:57.890
Two.

58:00.810 --> 58:03.854
- Thank you, Dr Dixon.
- It's customary to stay.

58:16.701 --> 58:19.036
You worked in a room like this?

58:23.249 --> 58:26.293
Bigger. Not so pretty.

58:27.295 --> 58:29.421
And there you practiced...

58:31.257 --> 58:32.966
Comparative.

58:33.718 --> 58:35.385
Comparative what?

58:38.097 --> 58:39.765
Anatomy?

58:40.433 --> 58:42.851
Whose anatomies did you compare?

58:43.728 --> 58:45.896
Apes and humans?

58:48.066 --> 58:50.984
Zira, say "yes" if you mean yes.

58:53.029 --> 58:54.029
Yes.

58:54.113 --> 58:56.657
So you dissected other apes?

58:56.741 --> 59:01.662
Yes. When they died a natural death.

59:02.997 --> 59:06.792
- And humans too, of course.
- Yes.

59:07.502 --> 59:10.879
As they were made available.

59:11.214 --> 59:12.798
Available?

59:12.882 --> 59:18.470
The gorillas hunted them for sport,
with nets and with guns.

59:19.472 --> 59:22.140
The survivors were put in cages.

59:22.225 --> 59:26.061
The army used some of them
for target practice.

59:26.145 --> 59:29.481
We could take our scientific pick
of the rest.

59:29.566 --> 59:32.901
And, in the interest of science,
you dissected,

59:32.986 --> 59:35.362
removed and statistically compared...

59:35.863 --> 59:38.490
Bones, muscles, tendons,

59:38.575 --> 59:42.286
veins, arteries, kidneys, livers, hearts,

59:42.370 --> 59:46.373
stomachs, reproductive organs,
nails, tongues,

59:46.457 --> 59:49.751
eyes, noses, nervous systems,

59:50.169 --> 59:52.379
the various reflexes...

59:52.505 --> 59:55.507
Reflexes? Of the dead?

59:56.676 --> 01:00:00.053
No, no. Of the living!

01:00:00.555 --> 01:00:03.265
You can't make a dead man's knee jump

01:00:03.349 --> 01:00:08.478
any more than you can test a corpse's
reaction to a prefrontal lobotomy!

01:00:08.563 --> 01:00:10.731
You mean you were advanced enough

01:00:10.815 --> 01:00:14.610
to perform experimental
brain surgery on living humans?

01:00:14.694 --> 01:00:16.069
Oh, yes!

01:00:16.154 --> 01:00:20.699
We even tried to stimulate
their atrophied speech centers.

01:00:22.577 --> 01:00:26.038
Did you try to stimulate
Colonel Taylor's speech center?

01:00:26.122 --> 01:00:29.082
Of course not! He could talk already.

01:00:30.543 --> 01:00:33.962
When you left,
was Colonel Taylor still alive?

01:00:34.547 --> 01:00:36.757
We loved Taylor.

01:00:36.841 --> 01:00:41.178
We did all we could to help him,
Cornelius and I.

01:00:45.558 --> 01:00:48.935
- Cornelius!
- She should have a nap now.

01:00:49.562 --> 01:00:51.063
She'll get it.

01:00:56.235 --> 01:00:59.321
- Orderly.
- Sir?

01:00:59.405 --> 01:01:00.989
Please take the female ape to its quarters.

01:01:01.074 --> 01:01:02.240
Yes, sir.

01:01:03.743 --> 01:01:06.578
We have to get this
to the commission immediately.

01:01:07.997 --> 01:01:09.831
Gentlemen.

01:01:09.916 --> 01:01:13.502
I've received an official
notification from the president,

01:01:13.586 --> 01:01:17.005
ratifying the recommendations
made by this commission

01:01:17.090 --> 01:01:20.509
in light of the tape recordings
delivered to us by Dr Hasslein.

01:01:20.593 --> 01:01:24.554
Now, if you'll just be seated,
we'll get right down to business.

01:01:25.306 --> 01:01:28.225
Now, let me review our conclusions.

01:01:28.935 --> 01:01:34.106
One: by a majority vote, the commission
finds no solid evidence for hostility

01:01:34.190 --> 01:01:35.691
by either ape towards humans

01:01:35.775 --> 01:01:39.611
as at present constituted
in this year of our Lord 1973.

01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:44.616
Let me remind you
that this was by a majority vote.

01:01:46.994 --> 01:01:50.914
The male's attitude is that
of a well-disposed academician

01:01:50.998 --> 01:01:54.084
who studied the alleged
downfall of the human race

01:01:54.168 --> 01:01:57.170
with the true objectivity
of a good historian.

01:01:57.255 --> 01:02:02.551
The female's case is different in that she
committed actions against the human race

01:02:02.635 --> 01:02:08.807
of a sort which, if committed today,
would be called atrocities.

01:02:09.434 --> 01:02:12.310
But would they be so called
in 2,000 years" time

01:02:12.395 --> 01:02:16.231
when it is alleged that humans
will have become dumb brutes

01:02:16.315 --> 01:02:19.276
with the restricted intelligence of animals?

01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:22.738
It has been pointed out
that what apes will do to humans

01:02:22.822 --> 01:02:26.283
is no more than what humans
are now doing to beasts.

01:02:26.367 --> 01:02:31.246
Nonetheless, the commission is
sympathetic to Dr Hasslein's conviction

01:02:31.330 --> 01:02:34.791
that the progeny of these apes
could in centuries to come

01:02:34.876 --> 01:02:38.086
prove an increasing threat
to the human race

01:02:38.171 --> 01:02:40.797
and conceivably end by dominating it.

01:02:40.882 --> 01:02:43.842
This is a risk we dare not ignore.

01:02:43.926 --> 01:02:49.598
Therefore, the commission
unanimously recommends

01:02:50.475 --> 01:02:54.978
that the birth of the female ape's
unborn child should be prevented

01:02:55.062 --> 01:02:57.355
and, after its prenatal removal,

01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:58.940
both the male and female

01:02:59.025 --> 01:03:03.236
should humanely be rendered incapable
of bearing another.

01:03:04.405 --> 01:03:07.365
I now declare this commission dissolved.

01:03:08.826 --> 01:03:12.829
Savages! They are savages!

01:03:13.289 --> 01:03:15.916
Jabbing needles into my pregnant wife!

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:19.419
I've done that too, dear. And worse.

01:03:20.296 --> 01:03:23.548
Taylor thought we were savages at first.

01:03:26.385 --> 01:03:29.554
Did they make you tell them
about Taylor, too?

01:03:30.348 --> 01:03:33.767
They made me tell them
everything, Cornelius.

01:03:34.268 --> 01:03:35.393
Brutes!

01:03:36.103 --> 01:03:38.438
Shall I tell you something?

01:03:38.564 --> 01:03:42.859
I'm glad I did. We can't live with lies.

01:03:42.944 --> 01:03:46.571
After this, I doubt we shall
be allowed to live at all.

01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:50.867
Do you mean that?

01:03:56.707 --> 01:03:58.083
How long?

01:03:59.877 --> 01:04:01.920
A week. Maybe sooner.

01:04:03.756 --> 01:04:06.800
They treated you like dirt.

01:04:09.637 --> 01:04:12.639
Ma'am. Sir. Chow time.

01:04:14.433 --> 01:04:15.934
I'm not hungry.

01:04:16.727 --> 01:04:20.146
Well, maybe somebody else is
who can't talk yet.

01:04:20.481 --> 01:04:23.108
Come on, ma'am. It's pure vitamin C.

01:04:23.192 --> 01:04:27.612
You better have your soup and oranges
for the sake of that little monkey.

01:04:29.448 --> 01:04:31.658
- No, Cornelius!
- Nobody makes a fool out of my wife.

01:04:31.742 --> 01:04:35.412
- But ought we to call for...
- We just ought to leave.

01:05:01.355 --> 01:05:05.692
I'll be going back with Dr Hasslein soon.
I'm the one who has to tell them.

01:05:05.776 --> 01:05:10.113
- Stevie, you gotta come help me.
- Of course. I'll come right away.

01:05:10.615 --> 01:05:16.077
It just seems so cruel and horrible and...
I don't know. I'll see you.

01:05:18.956 --> 01:05:24.336
- Cruel, Dr Dixon?
- Unbelievably. Zira wants her baby.

01:05:24.503 --> 01:05:26.713
- So do I.
- But dead.

01:05:26.797 --> 01:05:28.006
Yes.

01:05:28.341 --> 01:05:31.343
You'd prefer the parents dead, too.

01:05:33.054 --> 01:05:34.429
Shall we go?

01:05:56.827 --> 01:05:58.203
Gate four.

01:05:58.537 --> 01:06:00.789
Just a minute, sir. I'll take a look.

01:06:02.458 --> 01:06:04.751
No, sir. The lieutenant hasn't checked in.

01:06:06.837 --> 01:06:08.797
- Night, Charlie.
- Night, Ed.

01:06:08.881 --> 01:06:15.303
Yes, sir, I'll tell him. "Contact the motor
pool." Yes, sir. Just as soon as I see him.

01:06:19.016 --> 01:06:20.684
Gate four.

01:06:20.768 --> 01:06:22.852
Oh, yes, Captain.

01:06:23.604 --> 01:06:28.441
No, sir. The supply truck
isn't due until 0600 hours.

01:06:28.985 --> 01:06:31.528
- Well, I'm sorry, sir.
- Good night, Charlie.

01:06:31.612 --> 01:06:33.321
I said good night.

01:06:33.406 --> 01:06:36.616
We haven't any way
to contact him until then.

01:06:36.701 --> 01:06:38.910
The depot's closed, sir.

01:06:39.620 --> 01:06:43.915
OK, sir. I'll be off duty,
but the relief comes on at 0430 hours

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.418
and I'll get him to pass the message.

01:06:46.502 --> 01:06:47.711
Yes, sir.

01:07:07.565 --> 01:07:09.649
Zira, what's the matter?

01:07:11.569 --> 01:07:15.739
I think my pains have begun.

01:07:16.323 --> 01:07:17.907
Oh, my dear.

01:07:33.132 --> 01:07:35.717
Administration, Doctor. It's urgent.

01:08:06.373 --> 01:08:08.958
- What happened?
- The apes killed their orderly.

01:08:09.043 --> 01:08:11.169
- Where are they?
- On the run.

01:08:11.754 --> 01:08:14.714
Now they've killed,
and for that they must be killed.

01:08:14.799 --> 01:08:17.341
It has to be done before
we start a stone rolling

01:08:17.426 --> 01:08:20.720
that'll gather enough
poison moss to kill us all!

01:08:36.028 --> 01:08:40.448
Look. I'm going back to the camp.
I'm going to find Lewis and get help.

01:08:40.533 --> 01:08:42.700
- No!
- Zira!

01:08:43.118 --> 01:08:45.953
I just lost my temper with the boy.
Now, they may...

01:08:46.037 --> 01:08:49.249
- It's better now. I can walk.
- Listen to me!

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:54.379
They may punish us for what we did,
but at least the baby will be born.

01:09:31.292 --> 01:09:34.252
- Were they armed?
- No, I don't believe so.

01:09:35.004 --> 01:09:38.006
Then there will be
no need for a shooting match.

01:09:38.591 --> 01:09:42.343
- Not strictly speaking, no.
- I am speaking strictly, Hasslein.

01:09:42.428 --> 01:09:44.970
Science regards these apes as unique.

01:09:45.055 --> 01:09:47.015
The people regard them
as practically human.

01:09:47.099 --> 01:09:51.603
Then they must be told that today's killers
could be tomorrow's mass murderers.

01:09:51.687 --> 01:09:56.733
Of course they must. I can think of no one
better equipped emotionally than yourself

01:09:56.817 --> 01:09:59.277
to persuade them of that possibility.

01:09:59.361 --> 01:10:03.656
But, in a democracy, we do not
shoot unarmed suspects on sight

01:10:03.741 --> 01:10:07.035
for a murder in which their
participation is still unproven.

01:10:07.119 --> 01:10:10.580
I want them taken, yes. But taken alive!

01:10:10.873 --> 01:10:13.791
- Is that clear?
- Quite clear, Mr President.

01:10:45.908 --> 01:10:47.492
You lost, miss?

01:10:47.785 --> 01:10:49.494
Oh, it's you, Dr Branton.

01:10:49.578 --> 01:10:51.871
You better be careful.
There's been a murder.

01:10:51.956 --> 01:10:53.706
- Murder?
- Yes, ma'am.

01:10:53.791 --> 01:10:56.584
The monkeys have killed
their orderly and escaped.

01:10:56.669 --> 01:10:59.420
What? I don't believe it.
How did it happen?

01:10:59.505 --> 01:11:02.257
I don't know. All I know is
they've killed their orderly

01:11:02.341 --> 01:11:04.592
and I have orders to find them.

01:11:05.886 --> 01:11:10.473
Drive carefully, Dr Branton. There'll
be a lot of vehicles in the area tonight.

01:11:35.124 --> 01:11:38.418
- Cornelius, what have you done?
- I didn't mean to kill him.

01:11:38.502 --> 01:11:42.839
He was teasing Zira, and I thought I'd just
hit him with a tray. Please believe me.

01:11:42.923 --> 01:11:45.383
I do, Cornelius, I do. But they won't.

01:11:46.176 --> 01:11:49.679
- Where's Zira?
- She's back there, hiding in the bushes.

01:11:49.763 --> 01:11:52.473
Stevie, she's in labor.

01:11:53.017 --> 01:11:56.269
Oh, God. Get in.

01:12:02.735 --> 01:12:06.362
Stevie... you won't take us
back to the camp?

01:12:07.448 --> 01:12:09.574
Get down. I have a better idea.

01:12:26.216 --> 01:12:31.262
Now wait a second. Just a moment.
Let me get this straight.

01:12:31.347 --> 01:12:36.809
You are asking me to risk imprisonment
for the sake of two fugitive apes?

01:12:36.894 --> 01:12:39.604
The answer is a thousand times

01:12:39.688 --> 01:12:41.939
yes. Oh, yes.

01:12:42.524 --> 01:12:45.485
I do it for you. And for Stevie.

01:12:45.569 --> 01:12:49.822
- And for your two distinguished friends.
- Notorious now.

01:12:50.783 --> 01:12:52.867
To hell with notoriety!

01:12:52.951 --> 01:12:57.163
What is a husband expected to do?
Stand by and see his wife insulted?

01:12:57.539 --> 01:13:00.583
Good God! Aren't we rude enough
to each other

01:13:00.667 --> 01:13:03.211
without having to be rude to animals?

01:13:03.295 --> 01:13:07.131
And, anyway, he didn't mean
to kill the boy. It was an accident.

01:13:12.054 --> 01:13:14.347
I appreciate what you're doing, Armando.

01:13:14.431 --> 01:13:18.851
Well, you helped deliver our last baby
and now you will deliver our next.

01:13:25.692 --> 01:13:28.403
Lewis! What took you so long?

01:13:28.487 --> 01:13:31.739
I had to work out some excuse.
They think I'm searching.

01:13:31.824 --> 01:13:34.325
- Armando's been a saint.
- Oh, a minor one.

01:13:34.410 --> 01:13:37.578
- Saint Francis would have fixed it better.
- Never!

01:13:37.663 --> 01:13:39.664
Say hello to Heloise.

01:13:40.499 --> 01:13:44.836
- And your goddaughter, Salome.
- Hello, Salome.

01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:49.424
- The first chimp ever born in a circus.
- No, Los Angeles has had four.

01:13:49.967 --> 01:13:54.095
- Los Angeles is not a circus. It's a zoo.
- So New Yorkers say.

01:13:55.431 --> 01:13:56.848
Lewis is here.

01:13:57.933 --> 01:14:01.269
Lewis. I was not responsible
for the death...

01:14:01.353 --> 01:14:03.938
I know. But you will be
responsible for a birth.

01:14:04.022 --> 01:14:07.442
- How is she?
- The pains are every five minutes now.

01:14:07.860 --> 01:14:09.193
Every four.

01:14:13.031 --> 01:14:15.575
Look. Look at Heloise.

01:14:17.703 --> 01:14:20.872
She's showing an expectant mother
what to expect.

01:14:20.956 --> 01:14:23.207
Mama.

01:14:23.792 --> 01:14:25.126
Say it.

01:14:28.672 --> 01:14:30.882
Don't waste your breath and strength.

01:14:30.966 --> 01:14:35.136
You know that the child of two primitive
apes will never learn how to speak.

01:14:35.220 --> 01:14:37.805
I'm getting into practice.

01:14:51.904 --> 01:14:53.571
There, that's good.

01:14:55.908 --> 01:14:57.158
Come on.

01:15:06.043 --> 01:15:08.252
What are we gonna call...

01:15:08.337 --> 01:15:09.504
Him.

01:15:11.173 --> 01:15:12.715
Milo?

01:15:27.397 --> 01:15:28.773
Congratulations.

01:15:34.488 --> 01:15:35.571
No?

01:15:57.094 --> 01:15:58.094
But, sir...

01:15:58.178 --> 01:16:02.098
Captain, I'm fully aware that you've
canvassed the areas we first established.

01:16:02.182 --> 01:16:05.476
Evidently we were wrong
because you haven't found them yet!

01:16:05.561 --> 01:16:06.852
Thank you.

01:16:07.437 --> 01:16:09.564
Now, Dr Dixon, can you pinpoint the date

01:16:09.648 --> 01:16:12.733
of the baby's birth
with any degree of accuracy?

01:16:12.818 --> 01:16:15.069
Well, I never examined her.

01:16:15.153 --> 01:16:18.531
But, from appearances,
I'd say a week to ten days.

01:16:19.074 --> 01:16:22.535
If it's that close, she can't
have gone far. Where do apes go?

01:16:22.619 --> 01:16:24.370
To other apes.

01:16:26.498 --> 01:16:27.832
Of course.

01:16:28.709 --> 01:16:31.919
Captain, start an immediate
and systematic search

01:16:32.004 --> 01:16:34.964
of every menagerie, every zoo,
every circus in the city.

01:16:35.048 --> 01:16:36.799
I'll augment your force
with the city police.

01:16:36.883 --> 01:16:39.844
And keep me informed about results,

01:16:39.928 --> 01:16:42.638
- whether positive or negative.
- Yes, sir.

01:16:48.061 --> 01:16:52.607
- Well, Lewis will think of something.
- I am so sorry. I had planned it all so well.

01:16:52.691 --> 01:16:56.736
In just one month, we move on
to our winter quarters in Florida.

01:16:56.820 --> 01:17:00.448
I could have released you in
the Everglades and, my dear friends,

01:17:00.532 --> 01:17:03.159
you might have lived happily ever after.

01:17:03.243 --> 01:17:06.078
But now... what can I do?

01:17:06.163 --> 01:17:09.790
You have done enough
to make us grateful to you for ever.

01:17:09.875 --> 01:17:13.210
I did it because I like
chimpanzees best of all apes.

01:17:15.088 --> 01:17:17.715
And you, the best of all chimpanzees.

01:17:19.885 --> 01:17:23.346
I did it because I hate those
who try to alter destiny,

01:17:23.430 --> 01:17:25.890
which is the unalterable will of God.

01:17:26.516 --> 01:17:29.310
And if it is man's destiny
one day to be dominated,

01:17:29.394 --> 01:17:33.397
then, oh, please, God, let him
be dominated by such as you.

01:17:35.901 --> 01:17:38.152
All I can now do to help you

01:17:38.779 --> 01:17:41.489
is give you this... for the baby.

01:17:43.909 --> 01:17:47.328
- It's a medal of Saint Francis ofAssisi.
- Who is he?

01:17:47.412 --> 01:17:51.666
He was a holy man who loved
and cared for all animals.

01:17:52.668 --> 01:17:54.210
Oh, thank you.

01:17:54.795 --> 01:17:58.756
We'll hang it around
the baby's neck. For protection, huh?

01:17:59.716 --> 01:18:01.467
- Thank you.
- Yes.

01:18:02.386 --> 01:18:05.262
And now, my dear, dear friends,

01:18:05.347 --> 01:18:08.516
before the police come
and the audience gathers,

01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:11.185
you and your pretty baby must go.

01:18:11.269 --> 01:18:13.354
Lewis is on his way.

01:18:13.939 --> 01:18:16.524
- Armando.
- Yes?

01:18:16.608 --> 01:18:19.610
I should like to say goodbye
to Heloise first.

01:18:20.278 --> 01:18:23.364
If only she could speak,
she would say how sorry she is.

01:18:23.448 --> 01:18:27.243
I know. But we understand each other.

01:18:30.956 --> 01:18:32.289
All right.

01:19:33.393 --> 01:19:35.478
This is as far as we dare to take you.

01:19:35.562 --> 01:19:38.689
The police have road blocks
on every main exit from town.

01:19:38.774 --> 01:19:41.442
- Here are your supplies.
- Thank you.

01:19:42.569 --> 01:19:45.988
- Can you read a map?
- I'm an archaeologist.

01:19:46.072 --> 01:19:47.865
I can even draw one.

01:19:49.576 --> 01:19:54.330
All right. We're at the city limits,
at the southern edge of this oil field here.

01:19:54.414 --> 01:19:58.584
Once you're over this hill there are
more oil wells, an abandoned refinery

01:19:58.668 --> 01:20:00.795
and a harbor down to the southeast.

01:20:00.879 --> 01:20:05.341
It's a kind of graveyard for old ships
that have become unseaworthy.

01:20:05.425 --> 01:20:09.553
I used to play there as a kid. Anyway,
there's a derelict tanker at one end.

01:20:09.638 --> 01:20:12.640
- You could hide there for a week.
- A week?

01:20:12.724 --> 01:20:16.811
Until the commotion dies down a bit and
we can smuggle you back to the circus.

01:20:16.895 --> 01:20:20.648
Then, as Armando says,
you can travel with them to Florida,

01:20:20.732 --> 01:20:24.610
found your own colony in the Everglades
and live happily ever after.

01:20:33.954 --> 01:20:36.413
It's time that you were moving on.

01:20:39.709 --> 01:20:41.669
- Lewis.
- Yes?

01:20:42.963 --> 01:20:47.091
If they find us... we shall be killed?

01:20:50.762 --> 01:20:52.137
Ultimately.

01:20:53.849 --> 01:20:54.974
Then...

01:20:56.268 --> 01:21:01.313
give us the opportunity to kill ourselves
if that moment should come.

01:21:04.526 --> 01:21:05.734
Please?

01:21:11.199 --> 01:21:14.577
I shouldn't do this,
but I guessed you might ask.

01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:24.879
You're the second human I've kissed.

01:21:31.177 --> 01:21:33.304
And you are the first.

01:21:40.645 --> 01:21:43.314
Come along, Zira! Now, don't dawdle.

01:22:26.066 --> 01:22:28.233
- The ape with the kid?
- Heloise?

01:22:28.318 --> 01:22:31.236
Oh, she's been with the circus
seven years now.

01:22:31.321 --> 01:22:35.074
And the baby's birth
was registered 16 days ago.

01:22:35.158 --> 01:22:39.745
Look how he's growing. The first
chimpanzee ever to be born in a circus!

01:22:40.747 --> 01:22:43.958
Do you realize
what a distinction that is, huh?

01:22:44.042 --> 01:22:46.961
It's like being the first fish
to be born on dry land.

01:22:47.045 --> 01:22:48.045
Nothing.

01:22:48.129 --> 01:22:51.298
Or the first bird to be born without an egg.

01:22:51.383 --> 01:22:54.510
It is like being the first baby
to be born on the moon.

01:22:54.594 --> 01:22:56.720
It's like being the...

01:23:02.185 --> 01:23:05.562
- Negative!
- We'll catch "em sooner or later.

01:23:05.647 --> 01:23:09.900
That's what I'm worried about - later.
Later we'll do something about pollution.

01:23:09.985 --> 01:23:12.611
Later we'll tackle
the population explosion.

01:23:12.696 --> 01:23:15.531
Later we'll do something
about the nuclear war.

01:23:15.615 --> 01:23:18.242
We think we got all the time in the world.

01:23:18.326 --> 01:23:20.411
How much time has the world got?

01:23:21.913 --> 01:23:24.415
Somebody has to begin to care.

01:23:38.513 --> 01:23:43.559
Oh! Like stars in space. Isn't it beautiful?

01:23:44.269 --> 01:23:47.271
Yes, it is. From here.

01:23:51.860 --> 01:23:53.444
We must move on.

01:25:07.977 --> 01:25:09.603
Who found it?

01:25:09.687 --> 01:25:12.272
The field superintendent
on a service check.

01:25:12.357 --> 01:25:16.777
It was hidden here in the workings.
I guess she didn't need this any more.

01:25:16.861 --> 01:25:18.028
So why don't we get moving?

01:25:18.113 --> 01:25:20.906
It's a big area.
We've called for helicopters.

01:25:20.990 --> 01:25:22.783
- How long will they be?
- 20 minutes.

01:25:22.867 --> 01:25:25.953
- Why so long?
- They're running down a fire report.

01:25:27.664 --> 01:25:29.748
- Keep me posted.
- Yes, sir.

01:25:49.227 --> 01:25:52.354
- What's the matter?
- They found Zira's suitcase.

01:27:46.844 --> 01:27:52.349
- Did Lewis really play here?
- Oh, it was probably cleaner then.

01:27:53.685 --> 01:27:56.103
It stinks of man.

01:27:56.187 --> 01:28:00.899
Oh, no, no. That's oil. And dead fish.

01:28:01.526 --> 01:28:05.570
Is that what man wanted oil for?
To kill fish?

01:28:07.782 --> 01:28:10.200
You don't like them very much, do you?

01:28:10.994 --> 01:28:14.037
- Who?
- Humans.

01:28:15.999 --> 01:28:18.709
We've met hundreds
since we've been here,

01:28:19.502 --> 01:28:22.879
and I trust... three.

01:28:37.729 --> 01:28:41.315
- He wants feeding.
- Yes, well...

01:28:43.651 --> 01:28:46.820
Well, there must be someplace
cleaner than this.

01:28:47.780 --> 01:28:49.364
I'll look around.

01:31:33.905 --> 01:31:35.530
Cornelius?

01:32:00.473 --> 01:32:03.016
I see you've had your baby, Zira.

01:32:04.268 --> 01:32:08.313
The Presidential Commission has
empowered me to take it in my care.

01:32:11.692 --> 01:32:13.151
Give it to me.

01:32:37.552 --> 01:32:38.969
Cornelius!

01:34:08.059 --> 01:34:09.351
Stevie.

01:34:24.075 --> 01:34:25.200
Zira.

01:34:25.868 --> 01:34:29.245
I want that baby.
If you won't give it to me, I'll shoot.

01:34:37.588 --> 01:34:39.255
My God, stop him!

01:34:49.600 --> 01:34:50.642
No!

01:35:05.658 --> 01:35:07.784
Keep your men here! Come on!

01:35:20.673 --> 01:35:22.549
What's she doing?

01:35:26.512 --> 01:35:28.304
Oh, my God.

01:35:55.708 --> 01:35:58.126
All hands on the guy lines.

01:35:58.878 --> 01:36:01.087
Drop the bail ring!

01:36:05.301 --> 01:36:09.679
All right, all extra hands in the back yards
to the quarter poles! On the double.

01:36:10.055 --> 01:36:15.226
As soon as you get that canvas packed,
I want every hand in the menagerie tent.

01:36:21.692 --> 01:36:23.610
Intelligent creature.
