down from the

07:12.365 --> 07:15.368

07:15.434 --> 07:17.103
- Next, each team will
put together a

"The Door to Atlantis."

07:20.773 --> 07:22.208
And go.

with the edges.

07:23.843 --> 07:25.378

You're kidding, right?
- No, look.

07:26.746 --> 07:28.247

go together.

{\an1}- You don't know that.
Take 'em apart.

07:33.920 --> 07:35.521
{\an3}- Fine. You work on
the edges.

07:35.588 --> 07:37.490
I'll do the middle.

07:44.063 --> 07:45.865
- Son, I minored in puzzles.

07:45.932 --> 07:48.034
{\an3}- Maybe you should have minored
in listening.

07:48.100 --> 07:49.235
I'm sorry, what?

07:49.302 --> 07:50.436
{\an3}- Nothing.

teams must work together to
bail out the sinking city.

And go.

- Come on, Dad. Hurry.

- Augh, ahh-ahh.

{\an1}Here comes the water.
Move to the left.

08:08.454 --> 08:10.523
Lincoln!
- You said to the left.

08:10.590 --> 08:11.858
- I meant my left.

08:11.924 --> 08:13.893
{\an3}- How was I supposed to know
that?

08:13.960 --> 08:15.561
You need to communicate.

08:15.628 --> 08:18.764
{\an1}- Well, if you think you can do
better, you get the water.

08:19.565 --> 08:21.000
- What's the point?

08:21.067 --> 08:22.501
{\an3}The Stankos are already on their
third bucket.

08:22.568 --> 08:24.237
We may as well just give up.

08:24.303 --> 08:25.638
- Fine by me.

08:25.705 --> 08:27.506
Clearly, "Legends" isn't
our thing anyway.

08:27.573 --> 08:29.609
- Maybe we don't have a "thing."

{\an1}- No droppings, no
disturbances...

18:03.816 --> 18:05.317
Wait a minute, "den."

18:05.384 --> 18:08.020
Rip says you can track a
creature by finding its

18:08.086 --> 18:10.255
natural habitat.

18:11.423 --> 18:13.225
[together]
Lola.

18:15.594 --> 18:18.197
- Lola, playtime's over;
we gotta go.

18:18.263 --> 18:20.365
- That's no way to speak to your
queen.

18:20.432 --> 18:22.601
Send him to the dungeon!

18:22.668 --> 18:23.936
- Lola, wait.

18:24.002 --> 18:26.038
I just came to
tell you, uh...

18:26.104 --> 18:27.439
there's another queen outside

18:27.506 --> 18:29.475
who says she's more powerful
than you.

18:29.541 --> 18:32.411
- What?
Well, I'll have her head.

18:34.213 --> 18:35.948
There's no one here.

18:36.014 --> 18:37.649
You lied.

18:37.716 --> 18:39.818
Well played, sir.

18:39.885 --> 18:41.753
- Let's move out.

18:41.820 --> 18:43.755
- Take care of my kingdom.

18:45.924 --> 18:47.893
- Aha. I found another D.

18:47.960 --> 18:49.294
Diet.

18:49.361 --> 18:51.230
- Lincoln, that's not human
food.

18:51.296 --> 18:54.266
- It is if the human is...

18:54.333 --> 18:55.267
[together]
Lana.

18:55.334 --> 18:58.737
[dogs barking]

18:59.972 --> 19:02.174
Lana, out. Let's go.

19:02.241 --> 19:04.109
- No can do, Lincoln.

19:04.176 --> 19:07.012
I gotta keep
these duck eggs warm.

19:07.079 --> 19:08.881
[ducklings chirping]

19:08.947 --> 19:10.983
- Congratulations.

19:11.049 --> 19:12.851
[ducklings chirping]

19:12.918 --> 19:16.488
Okay, we still have time to get
home before Mom and Dad.

19:16.555 --> 19:18.690
- So we're just leaving
Lily here?

19:18.757 --> 19:20.058
- Gah! Lily.

19:20.125 --> 19:21.660
I totally forgot.

19:21.727 --> 19:22.961
Where is she?

19:23.028 --> 19:24.396
- Probably still on the train.

19:24.463 --> 19:26.832
She really liked that train.

19:26.899 --> 19:28.300
[horn toots]

19:28.367 --> 19:31.303
- [giggling]

19:32.271 --> 19:33.405
- You guys stay here.

19:33.472 --> 19:35.107
[ducklings chirping]

19:35.173 --> 19:38.210
- [giggling]
- Ahh!

19:38.277 --> 19:40.345
- Um, excuse me, Ms.
Scoots.

19:40.412 --> 19:42.347
Could you
give me a ride please?

19:42.414 --> 19:44.449
I need to catch that train.

19:44.516 --> 19:47.853
- Uh, that sounds like a "you"
problem.

19:48.787 --> 19:52.457
- Look, you didn't get an
autograph from Rip, right?

19:52.524 --> 19:54.593
How about if I
give you mine?

19:54.660 --> 19:57.596
- My bae signed this?
Deal.

19:59.231 --> 20:01.266
Out of the way, mouth-breathers!

20:01.333 --> 20:03.502
- Choo-choo!

20:03.569 --> 20:05.671
- Ahh!

20:05.737 --> 20:08.674
- [babbling]

20:09.808 --> 20:12.311
- Oof!

20:16.949 --> 20:20.352
Ahh!

20:21.853 --> 20:24.523
[horn tooting]

20:26.925 --> 20:29.761
[gasps]
- Ahh!

20:29.828 --> 20:31.797
Augh!

20:31.863 --> 20:33.765
Spooky psychic girl
was right.

20:33.832 --> 20:36.768
My business did make a
big splash.

20:36.835 --> 20:38.570
- Good job, Linky.

20:38.637 --> 20:40.939
{\an1}- Thanks.
Well, we better get going.

20:41.006 --> 20:42.874
- Wait, what happened
to your signed book?

20:42.941 --> 20:44.943
Isn't that the whole reason
we came here?

20:45.010 --> 20:48.814
- I gave it to Scoots so she'd
help me catch Lily.

20:48.880 --> 20:50.482
- Oh, sorry, big brother.

20:50.549 --> 20:53.785
{\an1}For reasons incomprehensible to
me, I know that autograph

20:53.852 --> 20:55.020
was important to you.

20:55.087 --> 20:57.155
- Not as important as you guys.

20:57.222 --> 20:58.523
I never should have
dragged you here

20:58.590 --> 21:00.225
in the first place.

21:00.292 --> 21:02.894
I was supposed
to be responsible for you.

21:02.961 --> 21:04.029
I'm sorry.

21:04.096 --> 21:05.697
- It's okay, big brother.

21:05.764 --> 21:07.165
We forgive you.

21:07.232 --> 21:08.367
- Ish.

21:08.433 --> 21:11.203
- Let's go home.

21:11.269 --> 21:12.904
- May I come with?

21:13.805 --> 21:15.340
- Negatory.

21:15.407 --> 21:17.175
Your services are needed
more here than in my home.

21:17.242 --> 21:19.244
{\an1}This mall requires a thorough
clean-up.

21:19.311 --> 21:22.914
Make me proud.

21:22.981 --> 21:23.982
- Hey, guys, we're home.

21:24.049 --> 21:25.651
- Lincoln, guess what,

21:25.717 --> 21:27.419
We stopped at the mall, and Rip
Hardcore was there

21:27.486 --> 21:28.920
signing books.

21:28.987 --> 21:32.491
{\an3}We know you're a big
fan, so we got you one.

21:33.291 --> 21:35.627
{\an3}- A little thank you
for helping out today.

21:35.694 --> 21:38.296
It's so great that we can
count on you.

21:38.363 --> 21:41.333
{\an1}- Actually, I have to tell
you something.

21:41.400 --> 21:43.702
The truth is--
- He let us jump on the bed.

21:43.769 --> 21:45.537
{\an1}- But only because
we kept bugging him.

21:45.604 --> 21:47.539
- Lincoln was a top-rate
babysitter.

21:47.606 --> 21:49.908
- I give him a 9 out of 10.

21:49.975 --> 21:52.511
{\an3}- [chuckles] I think we can live
with that.

21:52.577 --> 21:54.680
- What'd you do that for?

21:54.746 --> 21:56.415
{\an3}- That was my little
thank you

21:56.481 --> 21:58.183
{\an3}for letting us keep the
ducklings.

21:58.250 --> 21:59.317
Wait, what?
