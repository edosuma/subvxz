[Madame Kali] <i>She's the one
the Master seeks above all.</i>

00:04.370 --> 00:06.203
What do you want of me?

00:06.205 --> 00:08.705
Sometimes you tie a lamb
to lure a lion.

00:08.707 --> 00:10.807
The Wolf of God.

00:10.809 --> 00:13.076
<i>Stand alongside
the great winged Lucifer</i>

00:13.078 --> 00:15.712
<i>as he reconquers
heaven's bloody throne.</i>

00:18.584 --> 00:21.285
This sad little world is ours.

00:21.287 --> 00:23.219
[Lavinia] Let's go explore
what Father's been building.

00:25.289 --> 00:27.023
[Octavia]
<i>Animals are right in cages.</i>

00:27.025 --> 00:28.391
You can't keep me here.

00:28.393 --> 00:29.726
But of course we can.

00:29.728 --> 00:30.960
[Rusk] <i>Ethan Talbot.</i>

00:30.962 --> 00:32.762
<i>You will not take
one step from this house</i>

00:32.764 --> 00:33.930
<i>when you will not be observed.</i>

00:33.932 --> 00:36.632
Cornered animals
are the most dangerous.

00:36.634 --> 00:38.068
But they are cornered,
nonetheless.

00:38.070 --> 00:39.802
- You're not real.

[Frankenstein]
<i>Sir Malcolm's in trouble.</i>

00:42.106 --> 00:43.706
I will not
let him suffer alone.

00:43.708 --> 00:47.142
What if Miss Ives should prove
stronger than you think?

00:47.144 --> 00:48.977
If I were of
another constitution,

00:48.979 --> 00:50.713
I would fear you.

00:50.715 --> 00:51.847
She's gone.

00:51.849 --> 00:53.749
Oh, for fuck's sake!
Get the others!

00:53.751 --> 00:55.150
[Lyle] <i>You have no idea</i>

00:55.152 --> 00:56.885

00:56.887 --> 00:59.121
Welcome to my home, Miss Ives.

01:01.192 --> 01:03.325

It's Doctor Frankenstein.

01:04.628 --> 01:06.195
[Creature] Father.

01:06.197 --> 01:07.562
Your children have returned.

01:11.202 --> 01:12.534
[snarling]

01:14.169 --> 01:16.271
I need to see
Sir Malcolm immediately.

01:16.273 --> 01:18.440
There's someone else
you need to see first.

01:18.442 --> 01:20.475
[Vanessa]
<i>So, I'm to meet your Master?</i>

01:20.477 --> 01:22.344

[Vanessa dummy] Murderer.

03:16.256 --> 03:18.323
How many scattered corpses
will you leave

03:18.325 --> 03:19.724
in your bloody wake

03:19.726 --> 03:21.860
before your life
has run its course?

03:21.862 --> 03:25.663
A hundred? A thousand? A race?

03:26.965 --> 03:29.667
Or will it be all of mankind
we devour?

03:36.241 --> 03:38.709
And you speak
for the Fallen Angel?

03:38.711 --> 03:40.778
"The Fallen Angel."

03:40.780 --> 03:42.980
Much the most
gentle appellation

03:42.982 --> 03:45.048
you could give me, beloved.

03:46.384 --> 03:47.751
Beloved, is it?

03:48.853 --> 03:51.755
Don't deny what you know
to be true, Amunet.

03:56.294 --> 03:58.428
And all of this...

03:58.430 --> 04:01.330
the witches, the attacks...

04:01.332 --> 04:02.866
just to bring me here.

04:03.967 --> 04:06.035
I've missed you, Vanessa.

04:09.573 --> 04:10.607
No.

04:13.343 --> 04:15.244
No, you need me to agree.

04:16.613 --> 04:18.647
You can't take my soul.

04:18.649 --> 04:20.149
I have to give it.

04:20.151 --> 04:21.617
[Vanessa dummy]
You must give it, freely,

04:21.619 --> 04:24.120
and of your own accord.

04:24.122 --> 04:25.788
I do not snatch tributes

04:25.790 --> 04:28.524
like a starving slave
grasping for bones.

04:30.493 --> 04:34.195
And for this carnival trickery
he promises you eternal youth?

04:34.197 --> 04:35.363
Nay...

04:36.666 --> 04:38.199
delivers.

04:38.201 --> 04:40.969
Can your vanity so blind you
to his duplicity?

04:42.071 --> 04:43.839
He is the Father of Lies.

04:43.841 --> 04:45.674
[Madame Kali]
Who's the liar here?

04:45.676 --> 04:47.042
You claim to stand
with the angel

04:47.044 --> 04:50.511
while your every action
speaks otherwise.

04:50.513 --> 04:51.879
[Vanessa dummy]
What is your life

04:51.881 --> 04:56.084
but a catalog of depravity,
betrayal, and now homicide?

04:56.086 --> 04:57.885
I will not compound my guilt

04:57.887 --> 05:00.155
by accepting
your ministrations.

05:00.157 --> 05:01.957
But you already have.

05:01.959 --> 05:03.925
The moment you opened
your mouth

05:03.927 --> 05:05.927
and spoke the Verbis Diablo.

05:05.929 --> 05:08.262
The moment you stretched
your midnight powers

05:08.264 --> 05:10.397
to take the life of another.

05:10.399 --> 05:11.899
[Vanessa dummy]
At that moment,

05:11.901 --> 05:15.035
you took me in your arms
and kissed me deep.

05:16.137 --> 05:18.873
Kiss me now and end the pain.

05:20.141 --> 05:21.842
My soul is mine...

05:21.844 --> 05:24.244
that part of God is mine!

05:24.246 --> 05:25.312
God has turned
his back on you.

05:26.414 --> 05:29.249
Church, God,
Ministers of Grace.

05:29.251 --> 05:31.118
You've left them behind,
you know you have.

05:31.120 --> 05:32.319
No!

05:32.321 --> 05:34.455
All of that is behind you,

05:34.457 --> 05:36.390
but what lies ahead?

05:39.326 --> 05:40.660
Think of it.

05:41.762 --> 05:43.597
All of time.

05:43.599 --> 05:45.932
All of history.

05:45.934 --> 05:48.434
Everlasting power
to rule the darkness

05:48.436 --> 05:51.738
with he who loves you,
and will never reject you.

05:54.074 --> 05:56.342
You have no power to tempt me.

05:56.344 --> 05:59.178
I have faced eyes
more cruel than yours, woman.

06:01.081 --> 06:02.248
[Vanessa dummy]
Then face mine.

06:04.684 --> 06:06.219
Face yourself.

06:08.588 --> 06:12.558
There is no more powerful
inducement to me than this.

06:12.560 --> 06:14.493
Know yourself.

06:18.665 --> 06:20.098
[hissing]

06:24.437 --> 06:26.838
[thunder rumbling]

06:26.840 --> 06:29.741

06:29.743 --> 06:31.576
How could you let me be hurt?

06:33.212 --> 06:36.848
Him. It was him.

06:36.850 --> 06:39.151
What am I
but an extension of you?

06:40.286 --> 06:42.587
All your sin emptied into me.

06:44.023 --> 06:46.390
I'm your other half...

06:46.392 --> 06:48.426
- your truest self.
- [thunder cracking]

06:48.428 --> 06:50.695
[Lily]
Don't blame the children

06:50.697 --> 06:52.030
for the father's cruelty.

06:54.600 --> 06:56.634
[Proteus]
We were born innocent.

06:57.803 --> 07:00.037
You made us into monsters.

07:02.307 --> 07:04.341
[Gladys] I don't know how
you can live with it, Malcolm.

07:04.343 --> 07:06.777
[Mina] All those tombstones
in a row.

07:06.779 --> 07:09.280
Wife, daughter, son.

07:09.282 --> 07:10.714
Not me. Not my doing.

07:10.716 --> 07:12.183
You know it was.

07:12.185 --> 07:14.552
Who walked away as I starved?

07:14.554 --> 07:15.919
Who pulled the trigger
that killed me, Father?

07:15.921 --> 07:17.420
Did you name a mountain
after me?

07:17.422 --> 07:20.090
Did you enjoy her body
as I bled?

07:20.092 --> 07:22.092
Did we ask for this life?

07:23.294 --> 07:25.095
Or was it your pride?

07:26.530 --> 07:29.933
To conquer death is...
an ennobled calling.

07:31.402 --> 07:33.103
I am a scientist.

07:35.272 --> 07:36.772
A scientist.

07:36.774 --> 07:39.375
And when you touched
my naked body?

07:39.377 --> 07:42.145
Your fingertips
running along my flesh.

07:42.147 --> 07:44.247
This was abuse...

07:44.249 --> 07:45.648
not science.

07:47.618 --> 07:49.451
[Proteus] I was your friend.

07:51.021 --> 07:52.955
I never had another.

07:52.957 --> 07:56.092
You walked away
at the moment of my birth.

08:00.030 --> 08:02.364
[Sir Malcolm]
The past is dead.

08:06.436 --> 08:08.570
I cannot remake what's done.

08:08.572 --> 08:10.805
Come to the graveyard
on the hill

08:10.807 --> 08:12.807
and tell me the past is dead.

08:12.809 --> 08:13.975
[Peter] Touch the tombstones.

08:13.977 --> 08:15.511
We're still warm.

08:15.513 --> 08:17.613
And so we walk
with your sin...

08:18.714 --> 08:19.914
dead...

08:19.916 --> 08:21.816
and yet not fully alive.

08:22.918 --> 08:25.020
Haunting the twilight,

08:25.022 --> 08:26.420
living between.

08:31.426 --> 08:33.628
This is what you have made,
Victor.

08:35.597 --> 08:37.398
If I could go back...

08:39.467 --> 08:40.900
it would be different.

08:40.903 --> 08:43.304
Live my life again,
I would do such other things.

08:44.406 --> 08:48.709
Husband...
life only leads forward.

08:48.711 --> 08:51.646
There is no going back,
Creator.

08:51.648 --> 08:53.447
There is only
this moment on, Father.

08:54.550 --> 08:56.650
That's what you taught me.

08:56.652 --> 08:59.419
Intrepidly moving forward
no matter the obstacles.

08:59.421 --> 09:01.021
Explorers.

09:02.490 --> 09:06.293
[Creature] You are a man
who discovers new worlds,

09:06.295 --> 09:08.295
always grasping for tomorrow.

09:10.098 --> 09:12.199
[Proteus]
So will you do that now?

09:15.503 --> 09:17.036
How will you atone?

09:17.038 --> 09:19.972
What peace can there be
without atonement?

09:22.176 --> 09:23.243
How?

09:23.245 --> 09:25.612
[Sir Malcolm]
What would you have me do?

09:28.782 --> 09:31.951
You have the engines
of the future all around you.

09:31.953 --> 09:32.952
[Lily] The needle.

09:34.755 --> 09:37.423
The scalpel. The noose.

09:37.425 --> 09:39.225
The gun to the temple.

09:39.227 --> 09:41.327
Take your razor
and slit your throat.

09:41.329 --> 09:43.062
Join your family.

09:43.064 --> 09:44.763
A final tombstone on the hill.

09:46.132 --> 09:48.834
The sip of poison
from the amber bottle.

09:50.437 --> 09:51.704
A single bullet

09:51.706 --> 09:53.272
under the chin.

09:54.941 --> 09:57.943
There is no other peace
for thee, Frankenstein.

09:59.045 --> 10:01.246
Walk into the river...

10:01.248 --> 10:03.215
let it bring you quiet.

10:04.851 --> 10:07.119
Enjoy our company.

10:07.121 --> 10:08.920
One of us again.

10:08.922 --> 10:10.255
Father.

10:10.257 --> 10:11.857
[Gladys] Husband.

10:11.859 --> 10:12.891
Father.

10:14.127 --> 10:15.426
Lover.

10:16.896 --> 10:18.730
Brother.

10:18.732 --> 10:21.065
Come home. Please.

10:31.176 --> 10:32.377
End it.

10:34.646 --> 10:35.980
[Vanessa] <i>You can't tempt me.</i>

10:37.548 --> 10:39.549
You can take my body,

10:39.551 --> 10:41.252
but my soul is my own.

10:42.353 --> 10:44.889
Not one thing you seek?

10:44.891 --> 10:46.957
Not one jewel...

10:46.959 --> 10:49.927
you prize above all others?

10:49.929 --> 10:53.797
[Vanessa dummy] Yes.
There is an old dream in you.

10:53.799 --> 10:55.131
A deep longing.

10:56.301 --> 10:58.101
- You know it.
- No.

10:59.537 --> 11:01.037
Let me show you
what I can give you.

11:02.139 --> 11:03.907
No.

11:03.909 --> 11:05.475
[Vanessa dummy]
To be free of pain.

11:05.477 --> 11:09.378
To be loved,
simply for who you are.

11:09.380 --> 11:12.115
Is that not the engine
of all human creatures?

11:13.217 --> 11:15.218
To be normal.

11:44.513 --> 11:45.780
[gasps]

11:45.782 --> 11:49.584
Mother, I don't understand
why Charles is so awful to me.

11:50.686 --> 11:52.054
We were drawing pictures

11:52.056 --> 11:54.256
and I made fun
of her silly horse.

11:54.258 --> 11:55.523
It wasn't silly!

11:55.525 --> 11:56.958
Well, it looked
like a hippopotamus,

11:56.960 --> 11:57.925
doesn't it, Clare?

11:59.027 --> 12:00.762
I'm sure it doesn't.

12:00.764 --> 12:02.196
No, it really does.

12:02.198 --> 12:03.231
Charles!

12:04.333 --> 12:05.333
Morning, Van.

12:06.869 --> 12:08.970
Sorry,
I got lost in the paper.

12:08.972 --> 12:10.839
[Charles] Ew! Don't kiss!

12:15.244 --> 12:16.844
We were drawing horses.

12:16.846 --> 12:18.346
[Charles] And hippopotami.

12:19.481 --> 12:22.383
- Charles!
- [Ethan] Horses, is it?

12:22.385 --> 12:23.885
Well, you know, I've seen
a few of those in my day.

12:25.354 --> 12:28.789
Tell you what, go get 'em,
give me a look,

12:28.791 --> 12:30.457
and I'll judge
their authenticity.

12:38.933 --> 12:40.066
Ethan.

12:41.302 --> 12:43.704
Why are you looking at me
like that?

12:45.306 --> 12:47.941
Nothing. No reason.

12:51.578 --> 12:54.080
I'm sorry, you're right.

12:55.316 --> 12:57.083
Sundays are for family.

12:58.419 --> 13:00.020
Speaking of which...

13:03.524 --> 13:05.525
Let's send the kids
to the park.

13:05.527 --> 13:06.992
- Ethan.
- Just for an hour.

13:06.994 --> 13:08.093
Stop it.

13:08.095 --> 13:10.195
I thought you wanted
a whole brood of kids?

13:10.197 --> 13:11.798
You know perfectly well

13:11.800 --> 13:13.499
that Mina and Jonathan
are coming to tea.

13:13.501 --> 13:15.835
Oh, not for hours and hours.

13:30.951 --> 13:33.752
Daddy, does this
look like a hippopotamus?

13:35.288 --> 13:38.189
Not at all.
Maybe it looks like

13:38.191 --> 13:39.958
a horse that's eaten
a little too much.

13:39.960 --> 13:41.927
[Clare] I like fat horses.

13:41.929 --> 13:44.162
[Charles]
Fat horses are too slow.

35:31.462 --> 35:33.731
sublimely malleable.

35:43.608 --> 35:45.108
[Lily giggles]

35:52.950 --> 35:55.051
You'll have to do
better than that, sport.

35:57.354 --> 35:59.355
Shall we kill him?

35:59.357 --> 36:00.857
[Dorian]
They're made for killing.

36:00.859 --> 36:01.924
[Lily] Mmm.

36:03.160 --> 36:04.260
[Dorian] I've experienced

36:04.262 --> 36:07.096
so many sensations
over the years...

36:07.098 --> 36:09.365
but never one
precisely like this.

36:11.235 --> 36:12.568
Complete supremacy.

36:13.670 --> 36:15.036
Cruelty even.

36:15.038 --> 36:16.705
Ascendancy.

36:16.707 --> 36:18.039
Conquest.

36:19.842 --> 36:20.876
And him?

36:23.713 --> 36:25.581
Shall we murder him right now?

36:26.683 --> 36:28.417
Entirely up to you, darling.

36:30.286 --> 36:31.987
[Lily] No.

36:31.989 --> 36:34.222
He might still prove
useful to us.

36:35.424 --> 36:36.825
Let him live.

36:38.261 --> 36:40.461
Let him live
with what he has created...

36:41.563 --> 36:42.931
a master race.

36:44.033 --> 36:47.134
A race of immortals,
meant to command.

36:48.704 --> 36:52.640
- Soon, he will kneel to us.
- [Dorian] They all will.

36:52.642 --> 36:54.709
When our day has come...

36:55.977 --> 36:58.078
you will know terror.

37:01.417 --> 37:04.051
Until then, little man...

37:04.053 --> 37:08.022
live with the knowledge
of what you have spawned.

37:08.024 --> 37:09.389
And suffer.

38:02.776 --> 38:03.942
[bell tolling]

38:09.715 --> 38:12.751
[Sir Malcolm]
I'll bring him home to Africa.

38:12.753 --> 38:15.320
From whence I should
never have brought him.

38:16.822 --> 38:19.057
Let him lie
in his native earth.

38:22.028 --> 38:23.595
You'll be all right?

38:28.701 --> 38:29.934
Of course.

38:31.937 --> 38:33.971
Mr. Chandler will be here.

38:35.941 --> 38:37.742
Don't worry about me.

38:41.179 --> 38:43.447
Sembene was a proper man.

38:45.550 --> 38:47.184
I've not known many.

39:54.049 --> 39:55.749
You know what I am.

39:57.552 --> 39:58.786
Yes.

40:00.255 --> 40:01.889
And here I stand.

40:10.699 --> 40:13.200
Sir Malcolm
is going to Africa.

40:13.202 --> 40:15.102
This dreadful house
will soon be empty.

40:15.104 --> 40:17.905
We can lock the doors
and walk away forever.

40:21.977 --> 40:24.177
There's no walking away
from what I am.

40:25.279 --> 40:26.914
What we both are.

40:35.223 --> 40:38.025
I have run from the darkness
for so long...

40:39.127 --> 40:41.928
only to find myself
in a place darker still.

40:46.099 --> 40:47.700
Walk with me.

40:50.103 --> 40:52.939
You recall the night
I came to your room?

40:52.941 --> 40:54.707
I was so frightened.

40:54.709 --> 40:56.275
You were kind,

40:56.277 --> 40:58.477
and in the morning
I was not so afraid.

40:59.713 --> 41:01.480
Stay with me tonight.

41:19.999 --> 41:21.567
[Ethan] And tomorrow?

41:23.970 --> 41:26.337
I promise you,
we will be less afraid.

41:33.379 --> 41:34.979
I need to think.

41:56.768 --> 41:58.135
Forgive me.

42:01.339 --> 42:02.439
I do.

- We tried to stop him, sir.

43:13.643 --> 43:14.876
Leave us.

43:16.679 --> 43:17.945
Go on now.

Shut the door.

[door closes]

43:34.462 --> 43:35.830
[Ethan] I did it.

43:37.900 --> 43:39.333
The Mariner's Inn.

43:40.535 --> 43:42.036
All of them.

43:44.073 --> 43:45.306
You'll confess?

Yes.

[sighs]

44:03.490 --> 44:05.025
Sit down, Mr. Talbot.

44:15.669 --> 44:17.403
May I ask one thing?

44:18.739 --> 44:20.540
You may ask anything.

44:21.642 --> 44:23.142
I'll confess to the lot.

44:24.245 --> 44:25.745
Just make it quick.

44:28.315 --> 44:30.916
- The hanging, you mean?
- Yes.

44:32.553 --> 44:34.186
There's not
going to be a hanging.

44:35.288 --> 44:37.322
At least not here.

44:40.460 --> 44:42.427
I've had this for weeks...

44:44.464 --> 44:45.631
but I wanted the satisfaction

44:45.633 --> 44:48.600
of writing finis
to this affair in my own way,

44:48.602 --> 44:50.269
- as I told you I would.
- [sighs]

44:51.371 --> 44:52.437
What is that?

44:53.539 --> 44:54.806
It's an extradition order.

You're going home, Ethan.

46:49.151 --> 46:50.785
Why are you here?

46:53.389 --> 46:55.123
I needed a friend.

Won't you sit?

[indistinct whisperings]

Are you leaving?

Yes.

For long?

Forever.

47:28.390 --> 47:29.456
Where will you go?

47:30.558 --> 47:31.926
Where I belong.

47:33.795 --> 47:35.462
Away from mankind.

47:38.098 --> 47:40.333
This dream I had... this...

47:42.102 --> 47:46.573
this long dream of kinship
with those unlike me...

it is gone.

47:54.514 --> 47:55.915
Yes.

When you have seen that
of which you are capable...

when you have stood in blood
long enough...

to a desolate shore,

48:09.964 --> 48:11.764

Yes.

48:17.471 --> 48:18.771
And you?

48:21.842 --> 48:23.509
Where is your shore?

48:29.682 --> 48:31.716
There is no place far enough.

48:34.687 --> 48:37.522
I've lost the immortal part
of myself, you see.

No.

48:41.061 --> 48:42.827
I've thrown it away.

No matter how far you have
walked from God...

48:58.377 --> 49:00.077
You don't believe in God.

But you do.

That dream is gone.

I won't allow you to suffer.
Not you.
