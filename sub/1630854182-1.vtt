[♪♪♪♪♪]

00:45.958 --> 00:48.787
[kids shouting playfully]

00:52.661 --> 00:54.706
[Mallory] I'm not necessarily

00:57.057 --> 00:58.754
the most fearful of death.

00:58.797 --> 01:01.713
[kids playing]

01:02.105 --> 01:03.193
[Mallory coughing]

01:04.281 --> 01:05.848
[Mallory] but I do think

01:05.891 --> 01:08.242
that when you leave
people behind

01:08.285 --> 01:11.027
that had fought so hard
to keep you alive

01:11.375 --> 01:15.118
and that have invested
all of their energy

01:15.162 --> 01:18.948
for years and years
to keeping you alive

01:18.991 --> 01:20.297
as long as possible,

01:21.690 --> 01:23.561
I think that would be
devastating.

01:23.605 --> 01:26.390
So I think my biggest fear is
that my parents would

01:27.652 --> 01:32.222
have to deal with my death
instead of the reverse.

01:35.834 --> 01:37.836
[heart rate monitor beeping]

01:38.707 --> 01:40.578

Just now,

01:44.887 --> 01:46.236
I don't have too long to talk,

01:46.280 --> 01:47.368
but if you get
this message soon,

01:47.411 --> 01:48.760
give me a call back. Okay.

01:48.804 --> 01:51.241
[water bubbling]

01:51.807 --> 01:54.679
[♪♪♪♪♪]

02:01.338 --> 02:02.426
[man] [on video]
Smile, Mallory!

02:03.645 --> 02:05.342
Happy birthday, Mal.

02:06.126 --> 02:07.779
Can I interview you?

02:07.823 --> 02:09.172
How do you feel about
your birthday party?

02:09.216 --> 02:10.652
[on video] Good.

02:10.695 --> 02:12.306
[man] [on video]
You having a good time?

02:12.349 --> 02:13.959
-[on video] Yeah.
-And how does it feel

02:14.003 --> 02:15.613
-to be three years old?
-[on video] Good.

02:15.657 --> 02:17.311
[Mallory] [voice-over]
When I was three,

02:17.354 --> 02:18.747
my mom was pregnant
with her third child.

02:18.790 --> 02:20.749
I was pushing
to name her Chomperina

02:20.792 --> 02:22.533
after my favorite character
inThe Land Before Time.

02:23.969 --> 02:26.058
But one day, my mom told us

02:26.102 --> 02:28.800
that Chomperina wouldn't
be coming to live with us.

02:29.801 --> 02:32.239
Her doctors had told her
to terminate the pregnancy.

02:33.631 --> 02:36.591
My would-be younger sister
had cystic fibrosis,

02:36.634 --> 02:38.419
the number one
genetic killer of children

02:38.462 --> 02:40.072
in the United States.

02:40.116 --> 02:42.553
[woman] [on video] Okay.
One, two, three. Blow.

02:43.728 --> 02:45.556
[Mallory] [voice-over] The
doctors said it wouldn't be fair

02:45.600 --> 02:47.297
to bring a child
into this world,

02:47.341 --> 02:48.907
knowing that it would suffer

02:48.951 --> 02:51.171
and probably die
within a few years.

02:52.215 --> 02:55.262
The next day, I was tested
for cystic fibrosis.

02:57.699 --> 03:01.224
[Mark] We were just
walking into a party

03:01.268 --> 03:05.228
to celebrate the birth
of a friend's son.

03:05.272 --> 03:08.275
And the pager went off,
because I had a pager,

03:08.318 --> 03:10.581
and it said, it was 911,
and it was a Cedars number,

03:10.625 --> 03:12.366
and I was like,
"Oh-oh, what's this?"

03:12.409 --> 03:16.196
So we went upstairs
into the bedroom and,

03:16.239 --> 03:18.676
and called
the genetic counselor.

03:18.720 --> 03:22.158
At first she said,
"We got the blood results back,

03:22.202 --> 03:26.075
and Micah
is perfectly all right,

03:26.118 --> 03:28.338
but Mallory
has cystic fibrosis."

03:28.382 --> 03:30.514
I remember vividly
noises coming out of my body.

03:30.558 --> 03:32.342
I literally
was about to pass out.

03:32.386 --> 03:34.301
They had to carry me
out of there.

03:34.344 --> 03:35.780
Oh, I felt like my,

03:35.824 --> 03:37.652
my daughter had just got
a death sentence.

03:40.350 --> 03:42.396
[on video] Since you are
our close friends,

03:42.439 --> 03:44.659
you know what this past year
has been like for us.

03:45.790 --> 03:47.488
It started when
Dr. Ruth Cousineau,

03:47.531 --> 03:50.273
who's here tonight
and the best OB there is,

03:50.317 --> 03:52.928
sent me to Dr. Larry Platt
for a routine amnio.

03:53.711 --> 03:56.323
He noticed a small spot
he called an echogenic bowel,

03:56.801 --> 03:59.239
which was eventually diagnosed
as cystic fibrosis.

04:00.327 --> 04:03.112
Everyone said I should
terminate, period.

04:03.721 --> 04:06.333
It was almost easy
because all I heard was

04:06.376 --> 04:08.857
what a terrible and deadly
disease CF was.

04:09.945 --> 04:12.513
But two weeks later,
when Mallory was diagnosed,

04:12.861 --> 04:14.819
I was told to be positive.

04:14.863 --> 04:16.821
CF wasn't the disease
it used to be.

04:17.387 --> 04:19.607
Gene therapy
would provide a cure.

04:19.650 --> 04:21.391
Mallory could live a long life.

04:22.087 --> 04:24.481
How was I to reconcile
these contrasting pictures?

04:36.363 --> 04:37.755
[coughs]

04:37.799 --> 04:39.366
[Mallory] My mom actually wrote

04:39.409 --> 04:41.585
a children's book about me,
about cystic fibrosis,

04:41.629 --> 04:43.718
called Mallory's 65 Roses.

04:44.240 --> 04:45.807
And it's called that
because a lot of kids

04:45.850 --> 04:47.199
can't pronounce
"cystic fibrosis"

04:47.243 --> 04:48.897
and they pronounce it
"65 roses".

04:49.376 --> 04:53.249
We were looking for a resource

04:53.293 --> 04:55.947
to explain to the kids,
to Mallory, to Micah,

04:55.991 --> 04:57.601
to her friends at school,
to our friends.

04:57.645 --> 04:58.776
[Mallory] So the book
does a really good job

04:58.820 --> 05:00.604
of explaining it.

05:00.648 --> 05:03.912
They basically say with CF,
you have thick, sticky mucus

05:03.955 --> 05:06.480
that builds up in your lungs
and digestive tract.

05:06.523 --> 05:08.351
There's a defect in the system

05:08.395 --> 05:12.921
that interferes with the ability
for salt to move around.

05:12.964 --> 05:15.576
And as a result,
sticky mucus develops

05:15.619 --> 05:17.926
any place that you have mucus.

05:17.969 --> 05:21.277
So your sinuses,
your pancreas, your lungs.

05:21.321 --> 05:23.323
And she,
they make the comparison

05:23.366 --> 05:25.412
to having your shoe
get stuck in gum

05:25.455 --> 05:26.674
and you can't get it off.

05:26.717 --> 05:28.328
The bacteria that other people

05:28.371 --> 05:30.591
cough on you
or that you pick up in the air

05:30.634 --> 05:32.244
goes into your system,

05:32.288 --> 05:34.943
and healthy lungs
and healthy people flush it out.

05:34.986 --> 05:37.641
But those with CF
have that extra stickiness,

05:38.120 --> 05:39.991
the bacteria gets stuck there.

05:40.035 --> 05:42.559
And over time, those repeated
infections destroy the lungs.

05:44.126 --> 05:45.606
[Micah] Yeah, when I was a kid,

05:45.649 --> 05:47.651
I didn't realize
quite how serious it was.

05:48.217 --> 05:49.784
And I knew she was sick.

05:49.827 --> 05:51.220
I saw the hospitalizations
and the treatments.

05:51.263 --> 05:52.700
But I didn't know
that it was fatal

05:52.743 --> 05:54.789
until much older in my life.

05:54.832 --> 05:56.834
And I think I was kind
of shielded from that

05:56.878 --> 05:57.966
for a long time.

05:58.575 --> 06:01.143
[♪♪♪♪♪]

06:03.624 --> 06:05.234
[Mallory] [voice-over]
When I was born,

06:05.277 --> 06:07.367
the life expectancy
was only 18 years old.

06:07.628 --> 06:08.890
[Mark]
Uh, that was the median,

06:08.933 --> 06:10.805
you know,
so things could happen,

06:10.848 --> 06:13.373
and you could die younger,
maybe even much younger.

06:15.070 --> 06:16.811
[Mallory] [voice-over]
CF isn't a disease

06:16.854 --> 06:18.726
that you can forget about
until you get sick.

06:19.422 --> 06:22.033
Its armies gain on me
with each passing year.

06:25.254 --> 06:26.821
[Diane] Anybody that lives

06:26.864 --> 06:29.476
with cystic fibrosis
knows that at some point,

06:29.519 --> 06:30.781
the lungs are going to give out,

06:30.825 --> 06:32.827
and the only option
is transplant.

06:32.870 --> 06:34.742
So it's something
that you grow up with,

06:34.785 --> 06:36.657
knowing someday
you might need a transplant.

06:36.700 --> 06:40.835
The one thing
that her first CF doctor said

06:40.878 --> 06:42.445
that I'll never forget

06:42.489 --> 06:44.665
is that we would dance
at Mallory's wedding

06:44.708 --> 06:47.232
because they expected
to have a cure

06:47.276 --> 06:48.973
by the time she was an adult.

06:51.541 --> 06:54.414
[lively chattering]

06:55.937 --> 06:57.242
[Dr. Pornchai]
When I first met her,

06:57.286 --> 06:59.941
she was around nine years old,

07:00.332 --> 07:02.465
and she's healthy.

07:02.509 --> 07:04.685
I met Mallory in about 2015,

07:04.728 --> 07:07.339
and she was about
22 years old at that time.

07:07.383 --> 07:09.994
And she moved back
to Los Angeles,

07:10.038 --> 07:12.649
um, after finishing up college.

07:12.693 --> 07:15.565
Yeah, when I first
met Mallory and,

07:15.609 --> 07:17.654
and her mother, Diane, um,

07:17.698 --> 07:20.831
I was really struck
by their level of insight.

07:20.875 --> 07:23.486
They had clearly
knew the landscape,

07:23.530 --> 07:25.227
they knew the situation
they were in.

07:27.055 --> 07:28.752
[Mallory] [voice-over]
People with CF,

07:28.796 --> 07:30.667
when we get sick
and end up in the hospital,

07:31.102 --> 07:33.844
it's like our wings are broken
and in need of repair.

07:33.888 --> 07:35.585
When we ultimately
do get back out

07:35.629 --> 07:37.282
and get to fly again,

07:37.326 --> 07:40.242
it might be lower and slower
than others,

07:40.547 --> 07:42.592
but we're gonna relish
the feeling of soaring.

07:45.290 --> 07:47.945
[Mallory coughing]

07:49.643 --> 07:53.560
It's hard to see the children
who struggle with breathing.

07:53.603 --> 07:55.692
Take a straw
and put it in your mouth

07:55.736 --> 07:58.434
and then plug your nose
and try to jog in place

07:58.478 --> 08:00.349
and see what that feels like.

08:00.392 --> 08:01.611
[Mallory] [voice-over]
How often is it that people

08:01.655 --> 08:03.004
walk down the street,

08:03.047 --> 08:04.701
take a deep breath and think,

08:04.745 --> 08:07.748
"Wow, that is amazing
that I can do that."

08:08.879 --> 08:10.664
Whenever I'm healthy enough
to take a deep breath

08:10.707 --> 08:13.057
without it hurting
or making me cough,

08:13.101 --> 08:15.364
it amazes me beyond belief.

08:15.407 --> 08:17.497
The stuff
I ask my patients to do

08:17.540 --> 08:19.020
is so difficult.

08:19.063 --> 08:20.543
You have to do
these aggressive treatments

08:20.587 --> 08:22.893
to your lungs every day,
and you have to take

08:22.937 --> 08:25.679
upwards of sometimes
20 to 30 pills a day

08:25.722 --> 08:27.332
just to be able
to eat something,

08:27.376 --> 08:28.986
you know, just to be able
to digest your food.

08:30.814 --> 08:32.816
[Diane] [on video] You want to
show me your hula dance, guys?

08:32.860 --> 08:33.687
-[Micah] [on video] Yeah!
-[Mallory] When I was three,

08:33.730 --> 08:35.297
when I was diagnosed,

08:35.340 --> 08:36.820
I started doing hours
of chest percussion therapy

08:36.864 --> 08:38.343
and breathing treatments
every day.

08:40.432 --> 08:42.522
[Mark] For the first year,
that was my job,

08:42.565 --> 08:44.524
percussion therapy.

08:44.567 --> 08:48.963
And I sat with her
for 24 minutes every morning

08:49.006 --> 08:51.835
and pounded
on her chest and back

08:51.879 --> 08:53.881
in eight different postures.

08:54.664 --> 08:56.710
And then I would come home
in the evening

08:56.753 --> 09:00.670
and do the same therapy
at five or six o'clock at night,

09:00.714 --> 09:02.759
and then I would go back
to the office to work.

09:02.803 --> 09:04.456
[Diane] And I refused

09:04.500 --> 09:06.023
for the first year
to do any treatments.

09:06.067 --> 09:07.459
She would cry and I said,
"I'm not doing it.

09:07.503 --> 09:08.548
I'm not doing it.
I'm not doing it."

09:08.591 --> 09:10.506
I felt like a child beater.

09:10.550 --> 09:13.161
Because if you don't hit
the child hard enough,

09:13.204 --> 09:15.642
you don't dislodge the mucus.

09:15.685 --> 09:17.731
She would cry
during the treatments

09:17.774 --> 09:20.081
and say, "Daddy, stop.
Please stop.

09:20.124 --> 09:21.952
It's too hard."

09:22.692 --> 09:28.568
The big breakthrough was
this vest to shake your lungs.

09:28.611 --> 09:29.917
[device humming]

09:30.961 --> 09:32.136
[Mark] [on video] Hi, Mallory.

09:32.180 --> 09:34.008
[voice shaking] [on video] Hi.

09:34.051 --> 09:35.226
[Mark] [on video] Can you
explain what the two parts

09:35.270 --> 09:35.966
of the treatment are, please?

09:37.489 --> 09:38.795
[voice shaking]
[on video] What two parts?

09:38.839 --> 09:39.709
[Mark] [on video]
The two machines.

09:41.319 --> 09:42.190
[voice shaking] [on video]
This one's the mask.

09:42.233 --> 09:44.192
And this one's the vest.

09:44.235 --> 09:46.629
[Mark] [on video] And, and
what's that big machine there?

09:47.369 --> 09:48.979
[voice shaking]
[on video] This is my vest.

09:49.023 --> 09:50.764
[Mark] [on video]
That's the vest machine?

09:50.807 --> 09:52.243
-[on video] Yeah.
-[Mark] And how often do you

09:52.287 --> 09:53.462
have to
do your treatment, honey?

09:55.333 --> 09:56.857
[voice shaking]
[on video] Two times a day.

09:56.900 --> 09:58.249
[Mark] [on video] Really?

09:59.163 --> 10:00.991
-Do you like it?
-[on video] No.

10:01.035 --> 10:02.602
[Mark] [on video] Why don't
you like it, sweetheart?

10:02.645 --> 10:04.386
[voice shaking]
[on video] It hurts.

10:04.429 --> 10:05.909
[Micah] You know,
it was always what we were told

10:05.953 --> 10:06.910
was just like if Mallory
does these treatments

10:06.954 --> 10:08.477
that she'll be healthy.

10:08.520 --> 10:09.521
And so I thought that
"Oh, she's so great

10:09.565 --> 10:11.001
about doing her treatments

10:11.045 --> 10:12.481
that she's always
going to be healthy."

10:12.524 --> 10:14.352
So seeing the,
the treatments didn't cause

10:14.396 --> 10:16.267
the same kind
of emotional reaction for me.

10:16.311 --> 10:18.095
She always had to be
doing her treatments

10:18.139 --> 10:19.880
in the living room, um,

10:19.923 --> 10:21.490
and she would always
pick the movie.

10:21.533 --> 10:23.448
Um, there's a lot of times
I spent

10:23.492 --> 10:24.754
watching the same movies
over and over again

10:24.798 --> 10:26.364
until we memorized every line.

10:27.061 --> 10:29.629
[water splashing]

10:32.632 --> 10:33.850
[kids shouting in glee]

10:36.113 --> 10:38.638
[Mallory] [voice-over]
It was 1998 in Maui.

10:38.681 --> 10:40.552
Before this trip,
I was always too scared

10:40.596 --> 10:42.772
to put my head underwater
in the ocean.

10:43.251 --> 10:45.949
That day, Micah asked,
"Will you come with us?"

10:46.471 --> 10:48.473
My dad convinced me
to put my head underwater

10:48.517 --> 10:50.562
with him and Micah
for the first time.

10:53.740 --> 10:56.307
From the first wave
I dove under,

10:56.351 --> 10:59.963
the underwater world
felt like someplace

11:00.007 --> 11:02.966
I was meant to be,
a place I needed to be.

11:06.361 --> 11:08.058
I'd dive down to the bottom

11:08.102 --> 11:10.974
and grip onto the sand
with all my six-year-old might

11:11.018 --> 11:13.585
and stay just long enough
to hear the whales.

11:13.629 --> 11:15.718
And then I'd emerge
coughing and sputtering

11:15.762 --> 11:18.765
and blowing the saltwater
out my nose.

11:18.808 --> 11:21.681
[gentle piano notes]

11:35.129 --> 11:36.826
And when we got out of the water

11:36.870 --> 11:38.872
two hours later,
my parents noticed something

11:38.915 --> 11:41.222
I wasn't even conscious of
at the time,

11:42.484 --> 11:44.312
that I was coughing
more than usual,

11:44.355 --> 11:46.314
a rattling, wet cough.

11:48.098 --> 11:49.752
But by the end of the trip,

11:49.796 --> 11:51.841
after being out
in the really deep every day,

11:51.885 --> 11:55.279
I wasn't coughing at all.
I was symptom-free.

11:55.323 --> 11:57.064
We didn't understand why
at the time,

11:57.107 --> 11:58.848
but we kept going back

11:58.892 --> 12:00.763
because there was something
about being there

12:00.807 --> 12:02.765
that just seemed
to make me healthy.

12:08.162 --> 12:10.642
[Micah] That was always
very much like a reset.

12:10.686 --> 12:12.644
Kind of just time
to rest and relax

12:12.688 --> 12:15.038
and help Mallory
get back to health.

12:17.258 --> 12:19.564
[gentle piano music]

12:27.355 --> 12:28.835
[Diane] The first time
we took Mallory to Hawaii,

12:28.878 --> 12:30.314
I think she was three years old,
although I went

12:30.358 --> 12:32.229
when I was pregnant with her.

12:32.273 --> 12:34.666
So her first official trip was
when I was pregnant with her.

12:34.710 --> 12:37.408
But as soon as we landed,
all of a sudden,

12:37.452 --> 12:38.583
she wasn't coughing,

12:38.627 --> 12:40.281
her nose wasn't running,

12:40.324 --> 12:41.717
and she just seemed healthier,
and she felt better,

12:41.761 --> 12:43.763
and her breathing
was less labored.

12:43.806 --> 12:45.765
[Mallory] [voice-over]
In the early 1990s,

12:45.808 --> 12:48.724
researchers figured out that
surfers in Australia with CF

12:48.768 --> 12:51.205
lived 10 years longer
than other patients.

12:51.727 --> 12:54.077
They discovered that saltwater
actually hydrates

12:54.121 --> 12:55.862
the thick sticky mucus
in the lungs

12:55.905 --> 12:58.299
we spend hours a day
trying to get out,

12:58.342 --> 13:01.041
which makes it easier to keep
the lungs clear of infection.

13:02.172 --> 13:04.131
Surfing and being in the ocean

13:04.174 --> 13:07.743
is the number one thing that
separates me from my disease

13:07.787 --> 13:11.616
and makes me feel
like it's not present.

13:13.314 --> 13:15.185
[Mark] [on video]
I think your mask is over.

13:15.229 --> 13:16.578
Can you show me how you
take it off and turn it off?

13:18.188 --> 13:20.495
[device humming]

13:23.977 --> 13:26.022
Is this your last treatment
in Hawaii?

13:26.631 --> 13:28.459
[voice shaking] [on video] Yeah.

13:28.503 --> 13:30.200
[Mark] [on video] Did you have
the best trip ever?

13:32.594 --> 13:35.075
-[on video] No.
-[Mark] [on video] Why?

13:35.118 --> 13:36.859
[voice shaking] [on video]
Because...

13:36.903 --> 13:38.034
[Mark] [on video] Look at,
look at, look at me

13:38.078 --> 13:39.819
when you're talking, honey.

13:39.862 --> 13:41.951
[on video] Because I like
doing hula dances

13:41.995 --> 13:44.432
and I didn't get to do hula.

13:46.347 --> 13:49.132
[Hawaiian-style music playing]

13:56.270 --> 13:58.881
Every playdate
started with treatment,

13:58.925 --> 14:02.929
and it was oftentimes
mostly at her house.

14:02.972 --> 14:04.974
And we would sit there
while she did it.

14:05.018 --> 14:07.194
[Talia] Yeah. I was never
allowed to watch TV as a kid.

14:07.237 --> 14:09.370
But Mallory could always
watch TV during treatments.

14:09.413 --> 14:11.459
So I would love
going over there.

14:11.502 --> 14:13.287
[Mallory] Having a disease

14:13.330 --> 14:17.900
that limits my ability
to socialize in certain ways,

14:17.944 --> 14:22.949
I ended up ultimately with a
much stronger group of friends

14:22.992 --> 14:25.821
because they're the friends
that I know are there

14:25.865 --> 14:28.215
when I'm in the ICU
and can't get out of bed.

14:28.258 --> 14:31.827
And they're there when we're
playing volleyball for hours

14:31.871 --> 14:35.004
and surfing
and having a great time.

14:35.048 --> 14:36.963
I think all of us,

14:37.006 --> 14:38.660
whenever we would go over,
it was something different.

14:38.703 --> 14:39.791
We didn't really understand
what it was,

14:39.835 --> 14:40.880
so we would always be curious.

14:42.707 --> 14:45.493
I did try on the vest, yeah.
And I thought it was really fun.

14:45.536 --> 14:47.147
And I remember
saying that to her

14:47.190 --> 14:49.149
and she would say, you know,
"No, it's not fun."

14:49.192 --> 14:50.759
[Mark] She would often
have a friend over

14:50.802 --> 14:52.413
while she was doing it.

14:52.456 --> 14:53.893
And if you're talking,
you're not breathing deep,

14:53.936 --> 14:55.416
so that she wouldn't
get the medicine

14:55.459 --> 14:57.331
and we would have
to scold her for that.

14:57.374 --> 14:59.724
You know, when you come home
after a really long day,

14:59.768 --> 15:01.378
the last thing you want to do
is do treatment.

15:03.206 --> 15:04.468
[Mallory] [voice-over] I used to
complain to my parents

15:04.512 --> 15:06.122
about having CF.

15:06.166 --> 15:08.298
[on video] Why do I even
have to do this?

15:08.342 --> 15:09.996
When she was nine,
she came home one day,

15:10.039 --> 15:11.780
and she said she wasn't
going to do treatment anymore.

15:11.823 --> 15:15.001
And announced her intention
not to ever do it again.

15:15.044 --> 15:16.567
[Mallory] [voice-over]
And stomp my feet and say,

15:16.611 --> 15:18.221
"It's not fair.
I don't deserve this.

15:18.265 --> 15:20.571
Why do I have to deal with this?
It's too hard."

15:20.615 --> 15:23.487
And Diane worked her over.

15:23.531 --> 15:25.054
[Diane]
I called Mark and I said,

15:25.098 --> 15:26.751
"Mark, I've tried
bribing her, cajoling.

15:26.795 --> 15:28.231
Everything under the sun,
and she won't do it."

15:28.275 --> 15:30.146
I couldn't get her to budge.

15:30.190 --> 15:31.843
[Mallory] [voice-over]
It's not fair. It's too hard.

15:31.887 --> 15:32.975
[Diane] I asked him
to come home from work.

15:33.019 --> 15:34.455
And he said to her, "Mallory.

15:34.498 --> 15:35.543
We're not asking you
to do the treatment

15:35.586 --> 15:36.718
so that you'll feel better.

15:37.371 --> 15:39.112
We're asking you
to do the treatment

15:39.155 --> 15:40.940
so you don't get sick and die.

15:40.983 --> 15:43.464
And if you don't do them,
you will get sick and die."

15:44.813 --> 15:47.947
And she burst into tears,
leapt up from the table,

15:47.990 --> 15:49.513
and went into her room,
and slammed the door.

15:50.340 --> 15:51.994
Twice.

15:52.038 --> 15:54.257
And didn't speak to us
for three days.

15:54.301 --> 15:55.867
For her to have even had one day

15:55.911 --> 15:58.827
of that sort of negative emotion
kills me.

15:58.870 --> 16:00.350
And she asked me years later,

16:00.394 --> 16:02.439
well, did I have to be
so brutally honest?

16:03.353 --> 16:06.878
And I told her that sometimes
honesty is the only arrow

16:06.922 --> 16:08.315
you have left in your quiver.

16:11.840 --> 16:13.233
[Diane] That's when she started

16:13.276 --> 16:15.061
writing in a diary
for the first time.

16:15.104 --> 16:17.889
And that's, um, when I think
she really began to understand.

16:17.933 --> 16:20.153
[Mallory] [voice-over] The
sinking and undeniable reality

16:20.196 --> 16:21.328
of my mortality.

16:21.371 --> 16:23.808
Null and void. Erased and gone.

16:26.072 --> 16:28.422
[pencil scratching]

16:42.349 --> 16:44.046
My mantra was "No pity party."

16:44.090 --> 16:48.746
I really had an attitude
and kept the tone in the house

16:48.790 --> 16:50.400
that we live for the moment.

16:50.444 --> 16:54.013
There was never, ever
one time, a conversation

16:54.404 --> 16:56.624
about her life being cut short.

16:56.667 --> 16:58.626
She would sometimes bring it up
and I would figure a way

16:58.669 --> 17:02.934
to not go there, to that dark,
negative place.

17:02.978 --> 17:04.675
Diane was very aware
of the prognosis.

17:04.719 --> 17:06.851
There were times
when I would call her

17:06.895 --> 17:09.506
and sense in her voice

17:09.550 --> 17:11.073
something was wrong,
and just go over.

17:11.682 --> 17:13.771
It was just she, she.

17:15.077 --> 17:19.168
she was open with
what was going on with Mallory,

17:19.516 --> 17:21.170
because it was a concern.

17:21.562 --> 17:23.825
And I think she understood
the nature of a village

17:24.956 --> 17:27.785
in helping but not open with,

17:27.829 --> 17:31.093
with what it cost her,
personally.

17:36.098 --> 17:38.622
[♪♪♪♪♪]

17:38.666 --> 17:41.408
[keyboard keys clicking]

17:50.243 --> 17:53.420
[Mallory] [voice-over]
It was 2004 in Los Angeles.

17:53.463 --> 17:56.553
It was the day before I was
set to start seventh grade.

17:56.597 --> 17:58.512
And my lung function
was 90 percent.

18:01.428 --> 18:02.994
My mom's phone rang.

18:04.083 --> 18:05.997
"Hello?" she said.

18:06.041 --> 18:07.695
She was silent
for a little while.

18:09.610 --> 18:11.394
I know her many faces
well enough

18:11.438 --> 18:13.918
that I knew something was
really, really wrong.

18:16.095 --> 18:18.575
Finally, she said,
"Are you absolutely sure?

18:18.619 --> 18:21.012
What does this mean?
Should we come right now?"

18:22.013 --> 18:25.539
She said,
"Mal, that was Dr. Pornchai.

18:25.582 --> 18:29.891
Your sputum culture results
came back. You have..."

18:31.458 --> 18:35.766
And she just looked at me
because she can't say it.

18:37.855 --> 18:39.509
We were both silent
as we got in the car

18:39.553 --> 18:40.858
and drove to the hospital.

18:41.990 --> 18:43.296
[Diane] That hospitalization,

18:43.339 --> 18:44.862
they told us
that she had cepacia.

18:44.906 --> 18:47.126
The doctor at the time
was Dr. Pornchai.

18:47.169 --> 18:48.910
[Mallory] [voice-over]
In a low voice

18:48.953 --> 18:50.607
and his thick Thai accent,
he said, "Mallory."

18:50.651 --> 18:52.087
[Dr. Pornchai]
I told her, "Mallory,

18:52.131 --> 18:54.176
this is not a good germ,

18:54.524 --> 18:59.921
uh, it's the germ that we never
want any CF patient to have."

18:59.964 --> 19:02.967
He said,
"This is a major step down

19:03.011 --> 19:06.406
and her, her, her life
is going to get much harder,

19:06.449 --> 19:08.843
and her treatments are going
to become more rigorous."

19:08.886 --> 19:10.671
[Mallory] [voice-over]
I really had never seen her

19:10.714 --> 19:13.108
react this way to any piece
of news about anything.

19:13.717 --> 19:15.980
At that time, uh, I don't know

19:16.024 --> 19:18.505
what it's going to be,
how it's going to be,

19:18.548 --> 19:21.508
but we just have
to monitor her closely.

19:22.161 --> 19:23.553
[Mallory] [voice-over]
A lot of whispering took place

19:23.597 --> 19:25.903
while I slept,
tossing and turning,

19:25.947 --> 19:28.776
coughing with a force
and depth I hadn't known before.

19:28.819 --> 19:30.821
[coughing]

19:31.213 --> 19:33.084
We found out that day

19:33.128 --> 19:35.826
that I was colonized with
Burkholderia cenocepacia,

19:35.870 --> 19:38.133
otherwise known as B. cepacia.

19:38.829 --> 19:40.744
It's the deadliest strain

19:40.788 --> 19:43.530
of the deadliest bacterial
infection known to CF lungs.

19:44.052 --> 19:47.229
[Mark] B. cepacia is
found in onion skins,

19:48.012 --> 19:51.842
so all of us are exposed to it
all the time.

19:51.886 --> 19:53.540
But it doesn't,

19:53.583 --> 19:55.585
it doesn't affect you if
your immune system is healthy.

19:55.629 --> 19:57.805
It's very dangerous
for burn victims

19:58.284 --> 20:02.505
and dangerous
for cystic fibrosis patients.

20:02.549 --> 20:05.900
It's harder
for patients with B. cepacia

20:05.943 --> 20:07.641
to be treated each time

20:07.684 --> 20:12.123
because this germ is
very resistant to antibiotics.

20:12.646 --> 20:14.300
[Mallory] [voice-over]
I had just returned home

20:14.343 --> 20:16.258
a couple of weeks before
from summer camp.

20:16.302 --> 20:18.739
At camp,
in between making friends

20:18.782 --> 20:21.568
and having the time of my life,
I skimped on treatments.

20:21.611 --> 20:23.700
I invited friends to hang out
with me while I did them

20:23.744 --> 20:25.963
and talked throughout
the entire thing,

20:26.007 --> 20:27.704
something my mom
would never allow at home.

20:27.748 --> 20:29.271
And she has lost weight.

20:29.315 --> 20:31.055
[Mallory] [voice-over]
I ate so little

20:31.099 --> 20:32.927
that I lost nine pounds
in one month from a frame

20:32.970 --> 20:35.103
my doctors were already trying
to fatten up constantly.

20:35.538 --> 20:39.238
We knew that her life
was going to be much harder

20:39.716 --> 20:41.022
and shorter.

20:44.504 --> 20:45.635
[Mallory] [voice-over]
How could they explain

20:45.679 --> 20:47.463
to an 11-year-old child

20:47.507 --> 20:49.900
that the trajectory
of her entire future has changed

20:49.944 --> 20:53.252
because of one virulent
and highly resistant pathogen,

20:53.904 --> 20:56.907
that her health could rapidly
deteriorate at any time,

20:56.951 --> 20:59.345
that she could never be around
other patients with CF

20:59.388 --> 21:00.998
because of the danger

21:01.042 --> 21:02.261
of transmitting the infection
to them.

21:03.784 --> 21:05.351
I didn't know
I'd have to be hospitalized

21:05.394 --> 21:07.744
multiple weeks a year,
or that I'd have to rotate

21:07.788 --> 21:09.746
through rounds
of powerful IV antibiotics

21:09.790 --> 21:11.922
that I'd be resistant to
but use anyway

21:11.966 --> 21:13.489
because there were
no other options.

21:13.794 --> 21:15.709
I didn't know at the time

21:15.752 --> 21:17.885
it meant I might not be able
to get a lung transplant.

21:18.277 --> 21:20.322
That once I reached
end-stage disease,

21:20.366 --> 21:22.019
I wouldn't get
the second chance at life

21:22.063 --> 21:24.457
I'd always expected
and taken for granted.

21:24.500 --> 21:27.329
[heart monitor beeping]

21:30.550 --> 21:32.465
[Mark] When Mallory
was still in a crib,

21:32.508 --> 21:34.858
I used to climb
into the crib with her

21:34.902 --> 21:37.296
and read a book
until she fell asleep.

21:37.861 --> 21:40.211
And then one time,
Diane came in,

21:40.255 --> 21:43.171
and I was sound asleep
in her crib,

21:43.650 --> 21:46.653
and Mallory was still
sitting up turning the pages,

21:46.696 --> 21:48.219
[chuckling]
looking at the pictures.

21:48.263 --> 21:51.614
I think she was maybe
two years old then, so.

21:52.180 --> 21:54.704
When she was in the hospital,

21:54.748 --> 21:58.142
I slept overnight at the
hospital with her every night.

21:58.621 --> 22:02.538
All throughout her childhood
and, and school years.

22:02.582 --> 22:07.674
[song playing]

22:10.416 --> 22:12.026
[Uncle Danny]
When I think about Mark,

22:12.069 --> 22:14.463
there's this engine
that's trying to figure out,

22:14.507 --> 22:15.943
what can we do? What can we do?

22:15.986 --> 22:20.382
What can we do?
And this very sad father.

22:20.426 --> 22:22.515
[song playing]

22:22.558 --> 22:24.299
[Mark] [voice-over]
I read a lot.

22:24.343 --> 22:26.519
I kept up on research
into cystic fibrosis.

22:26.562 --> 22:28.738
And at the time,
they were very hopeful

22:29.086 --> 22:33.917
that gene therapy
would produce a cure soon,

22:34.265 --> 22:37.007
within a matter
of, say, five years.

22:37.617 --> 22:41.360
This was a hope that all
cystic fibrosis parents

22:41.403 --> 22:44.319
at the time had,
and it was a false hope.

22:46.060 --> 22:48.105
[keyboard keys clicking]

22:48.149 --> 22:50.064
[Gaby]
The amount of research he does,

22:50.107 --> 22:52.893
something would come out
and he'd be on top of it.

22:52.936 --> 22:56.766
Mark and Diane,
they are very, very involved.

22:56.810 --> 22:59.639
They know everything
and they ask every question

22:59.682 --> 23:03.077
that you, you could,
could imagine.

23:03.120 --> 23:04.948
[Mark]
Mallory's case wasn't something

23:04.992 --> 23:09.866
that you could treat with,
with textbook remedies.

23:09.910 --> 23:12.391
It did, it really did require

23:12.434 --> 23:14.262
thinking out of the box.

23:15.698 --> 23:17.787
[Diane] [voice-over] Mark
really did all the research

23:17.831 --> 23:19.485
and knew
all the technical stuff.

23:20.224 --> 23:23.837
I was social, medical
appointments, fundraising.

23:23.880 --> 23:25.447
The question with Diane is,
where does Diane

23:25.491 --> 23:27.144
find the strength
to do anything that Diane does?

23:27.188 --> 23:30.713
I mean, she just has
boundless energy.

23:30.757 --> 23:32.280
I think it's a combination
of boundless energy,

23:32.323 --> 23:33.890
and, frankly, a complete
unwillingness to deal

23:33.934 --> 23:36.502
with anything that's sad
that propels that forward,

23:36.545 --> 23:39.113
and so she just
powers through it.

23:39.635 --> 23:41.071
[on video] Don't worry,
I'm not gonna sing.

23:41.115 --> 23:42.508
-[laughter]
-[on video] Come here.

23:42.551 --> 23:44.466
She started doing
the fundraisers.

23:44.510 --> 23:47.600
And they'd started
Mallory's Gardenevery year.

23:48.688 --> 23:50.559
[Diane] When she was three,

23:50.603 --> 23:53.170
she was into patent leather
shoes and party dresses.

23:53.606 --> 23:55.825
But when I came to understand
that it was all about sports,

23:55.869 --> 23:57.740
I threw away her party shoes,
took away all the dresses,

23:57.784 --> 23:59.394
and made her into a tomboy,

23:59.438 --> 24:01.178
so she didn't really have
much choice.

24:01.222 --> 24:03.137
I mean, you know, the ship
reflects its captain, right?

24:03.180 --> 24:05.139
And I was like, "This is what
it's going to be about.

24:05.182 --> 24:06.445
Getting that mucus
out of your lungs,

24:06.488 --> 24:07.968
however we have to do it."

24:09.535 --> 24:11.275
[Diane] [on video] Yeah. Yeah.

24:11.319 --> 24:13.452
I'm just showing the feast
that we have. Ugh.

24:13.495 --> 24:14.844
[woman] [on video]
Thank you, Diane.

24:14.888 --> 24:16.193
I was never a cook.
I hated to cook.

24:16.237 --> 24:18.065
But I understood early on

24:18.108 --> 24:20.284
that nutrition was critically
important as a form of medicine.

24:20.328 --> 24:22.896
And so I made it my mission
to cook and make sure

24:22.939 --> 24:24.114
she was always eating.

24:26.073 --> 24:28.423
Diane would always be the one
to text me to hang out

24:28.467 --> 24:30.077
and not Mallory.

24:30.120 --> 24:32.471
That's what she did with
everybody in Mallory's life.

24:32.514 --> 24:34.342
She brought them in

24:34.385 --> 24:36.779
and brought them
into her life as well.

24:36.823 --> 24:38.868
I did things that enabled her

24:38.912 --> 24:41.436
to be more engaged
in her day-to-day life.

24:41.480 --> 24:43.438
You're expected to clean

24:43.482 --> 24:45.266
your nebulizer,
sterilize your gear,

24:45.309 --> 24:47.877
prep your medicine boxes
with the pills,

24:47.921 --> 24:49.444
schedule your appointments,

24:49.488 --> 24:51.228
fight
with the insurance company,

24:51.272 --> 24:52.708
pick up the meds,
go to the doctor's appointments,

24:52.752 --> 24:53.840
go to all the ancillary
appointments

24:53.883 --> 24:55.232
for all the other specialists.

24:56.582 --> 24:59.236
How can one person do
what she does,

24:59.280 --> 25:01.674
but I mean, she does enough
for three people.

25:01.717 --> 25:05.373
Her MO is just to go, go, go
and squeeze, you know,

25:05.416 --> 25:07.418
every minute out of life.

25:07.462 --> 25:09.812
[Mark] [on video] Video is on.
Let's go, Mallory, let's go.

25:09.856 --> 25:11.422
Yoo-hoo.

25:11.466 --> 25:13.250
-Smile, one, two, three.

25:13.294 --> 25:15.252

25:15.296 --> 25:17.559
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

25:17.603 --> 25:19.779
So she was kind of
like Mallory's life admin

25:19.822 --> 25:25.306
and also mother and also,
like caretaker all in one.

25:25.349 --> 25:28.048
Um, and also,
all of our friends joke

25:28.091 --> 25:30.485
that she is,
we call her the "wingmom."

25:30.529 --> 25:34.576
And she would just
shamelessly try to pick up,

25:34.620 --> 25:37.100
in a non-creepy way,
but pick up men

25:37.144 --> 25:40.669
for like Mallory
or her friends to date.

25:41.888 --> 25:45.021
Yes. Well, one of the things
that I felt was really important

25:45.065 --> 25:47.763
was that my kids talk to me
about boys and girls.

25:47.807 --> 25:49.591
And so, way before
she ever would have been

25:49.635 --> 25:51.550
interested in boys,
I started talking about it.

25:51.593 --> 25:53.508
And I would say, "CBA."

25:53.552 --> 25:55.249
And then the girls would say,
"What's that?"

25:55.292 --> 25:56.990
And then I'd say,
"Cute boy alert."

25:57.033 --> 25:58.992
And then they would just
all giggle and turn bright red.

25:59.035 --> 26:01.690
[Gaby] When you're out,
and you're 16,

26:01.734 --> 26:04.780
and you're eating lunch
with your friends,

26:04.824 --> 26:06.652
and then the mom is like,
"Cute boy alert,

26:06.695 --> 26:09.089
cute boy alert,"
it's so embarrassing.

26:09.132 --> 26:12.309
It's, it's an insane thing
to do.

I was never troubled by that.

I, I always wanted Mallory
to experience

26:28.630 --> 26:32.678
all of the joys of life,
in, including love and romance.

26:32.939 --> 26:34.810
And I was happy for her.

26:34.854 --> 26:37.813
She, she picked
really good boyfriends.

26:37.857 --> 26:40.729
She had, she had a number
of very, very nice boyfriends.

26:42.252 --> 26:44.080

the first friend from home

26:44.124 --> 26:45.516
that I came out to,

26:45.560 --> 26:46.866
and it immediately went
from like,

26:46.909 --> 26:47.954
"I have to tell you
a big secret"

26:55.962 --> 26:57.572
[Gaby]
Boys liked her

26:57.616 --> 26:59.661
because she wouldn't
sweat the small stuff.

26:59.705 --> 27:01.707
She had this kind of
bigger picture

27:01.750 --> 27:06.059
that takes us a lot of years
to understand that mentality,

27:06.102 --> 27:09.889
that the little things
shouldn't get us riled up.

27:10.193 --> 27:11.804
[Mallory] I don't feel that I'm

27:11.847 --> 27:15.982
as easily bothered
by daily irritations.

27:16.025 --> 27:18.637
And I think
that's in part because

27:19.681 --> 27:22.902
I've had life and death things
to worry about.

27:22.945 --> 27:26.862
Um. but on the other hand,

27:26.906 --> 27:29.038
I don't think
that I'm unbreakable,

27:29.082 --> 27:33.086
and I definitely feel like
my body is fragile,

27:33.129 --> 27:35.001
even if my spirit
is very strong.

27:35.828 --> 27:37.525
Mallory did such a great job

27:37.568 --> 27:40.006
of kind of separating
her treatments

27:40.049 --> 27:43.879
and her hospital visits from
her lived experience in school

27:43.923 --> 27:46.490
and she was, she kind of set up,

27:46.534 --> 27:48.492
set a bar so high for herself

27:48.536 --> 27:50.799
in terms of academic performance

27:50.843 --> 27:52.758
and athletic performance
that I think her teachers and,

27:52.801 --> 27:53.976
to some extent
her friends kind of

27:54.020 --> 27:55.804
held her to that bar.

27:56.065 --> 27:57.937
[Diane] I was worried about
what she was really thinking.

27:57.980 --> 28:01.070
She was so perfect,
the perfect student,

28:01.114 --> 28:03.464
perfect friend,
perfect daughter.

28:03.507 --> 28:04.726
Perfect everything.

28:04.770 --> 28:06.467
I knew that she had been writing

28:06.510 --> 28:08.512
because she was always
writing on that computer.

28:08.556 --> 28:10.732
But because I hadn't
ever seen it,

28:10.776 --> 28:12.429
I didn't know what was in there.

28:12.473 --> 28:13.648
And I used to
try to break into it,

28:13.692 --> 28:15.606
but I could never ever.

28:21.787 --> 28:24.572
they see clear eyes
and freckles and long hair.

28:25.051 --> 28:28.794
People seek denial, reassurance,
and safety in my appearance.

28:28.837 --> 28:30.883
They see a "picture of health,"
as they say.

28:30.926 --> 28:32.798

a volleyball player,

28:32.841 --> 28:35.714

and normal exterior.

28:41.937 --> 28:43.417
But looks are deceiving.

[Mallory coughing]

28:49.205 --> 28:51.164
[ocean rumbling]

28:51.947 --> 28:53.862
Most days,
she looked pretty healthy.

28:53.906 --> 28:55.646
You know,
she'd go to swim practice,

28:55.690 --> 28:57.213
she'd go to volleyball practice.

28:57.257 --> 28:59.302
Um, you know, she would do
all those things.

28:59.346 --> 29:00.477
But then, you know,
when she got sick,

29:00.521 --> 29:01.914
she was really sick,

29:01.957 --> 29:03.132
and she was in the hospital
for two weeks.

29:03.785 --> 29:05.918
I met Mallory when, uh.

29:05.961 --> 29:07.702
so I coached Micah,
her older brother.

29:07.746 --> 29:09.486
So when Micah was a freshman,
Mallory, I think,

29:09.530 --> 29:12.663
was in seventh grade,
maybe eighth grade.

29:12.707 --> 29:14.274
Pretty much every sport
she played, she,

29:14.317 --> 29:15.275
she took to pretty quickly,
you know.

29:15.318 --> 29:16.929
She's tall, she was,

29:16.972 --> 29:18.669
I mean, when she was a freshman,
she wasn't six foot

29:18.713 --> 29:20.323
but by the time she graduated,
she was six foot.

29:20.367 --> 29:22.978
She's, you know, lean,
and you know, had a good arm.

29:23.674 --> 29:25.285
When someone first told me,

29:25.328 --> 29:27.156
"Oh, you know,
Mallory has cystic fibrosis,"

29:27.200 --> 29:29.332
I, I thought, "Oh, that's just
kind of a nuisance disease."

29:29.376 --> 29:31.770
I had no idea it was,
it was deadly.

29:31.813 --> 29:33.728
And she didn't,
she didn't put that out either.

29:34.860 --> 29:38.559
Once Diane called me kind
of in a panic, I was at school,

29:38.602 --> 29:39.865
and she said,
"Hey, Mallory's sick.

29:39.908 --> 29:41.997
Can you go find her for me?"

29:42.041 --> 29:43.694
She's on the front lawn
at Beverly.

29:43.738 --> 29:45.958
She had coughed up blood.

29:46.001 --> 29:49.178
Hemoptysis is when
you cough up blood

29:49.222 --> 29:51.311
and it can be very mild,
a little bit,

29:51.354 --> 29:54.096
and it can be massive,
which they count

29:54.140 --> 29:57.796
as 250 CCs of blood
in a 24-hour period.

29:57.839 --> 29:59.058
So I went looking for her.

29:59.101 --> 30:00.929
She'd coughed into the,
into the grass

30:00.973 --> 30:03.671
and there was a spot of blood
in the grass.

get the infectious agents out.

that still function

30:22.429 --> 30:23.517
will go the way

30:23.560 --> 30:25.388
and blacken, deaden, fail.

30:26.389 --> 30:29.001
So the airways rupture and
there's an outpouring of blood,

30:29.044 --> 30:31.307
bright fire-engine red,
sticky blood

30:31.351 --> 30:33.440
that spills up my throat
like a waterfall,

30:33.483 --> 30:36.312
traveling inexplicably
against gravity.

30:36.356 --> 30:38.445
It explodes up
like an erupting volcano

30:38.488 --> 30:40.229
and everyone else
gets to run away,

30:40.273 --> 30:42.057
except I can't.

30:42.666 --> 30:44.451
Because I am the volcano.

30:45.931 --> 30:49.978
-[beeps]
-[Mallory coughing]

30:50.022 --> 30:52.154
[Diane] [on video] Oh, my Lord.

30:55.114 --> 30:56.855
[Mallory] Maybe more.

30:57.333 --> 30:59.596
[Mallory coughing]

30:59.640 --> 31:00.902
[man] [on video] Cough it up.

31:00.946 --> 31:02.904
[Mallory coughing]

31:02.948 --> 31:04.297
[Mallory spits]

31:07.169 --> 31:09.737
[heart monitor beeping]

31:10.825 --> 31:12.218
[Mallory]
It was the spring

31:12.261 --> 31:13.872
of my senior year of high school

31:13.915 --> 31:15.917
and my lung function
was down to 60 percent

31:15.961 --> 31:18.398
from my then-baseline
of 75 percent.

31:18.659 --> 31:21.270
I was also 15 pounds
underweight.

31:21.314 --> 31:23.185
A few months
of disordered eating

31:23.229 --> 31:25.448
was enough to give
my B. cepacia infection

31:25.492 --> 31:27.233
the upper hand,

31:27.276 --> 31:29.104
and permanently alter
the trajectory of my health.

31:30.018 --> 31:31.367
High school
was really the first time

31:31.411 --> 31:34.588
that I got to experience Mallory

31:34.936 --> 31:37.765
going from being
extremely healthy, you know,

31:37.808 --> 31:40.246
healthy-seeming one day
and, you know,

31:40.289 --> 31:42.248
killing it in a,
in a water polo game

31:42.291 --> 31:43.640
or a volleyball game,

31:43.684 --> 31:45.425
and then she would
throw up blood

31:45.468 --> 31:47.427
and then be out for three weeks.

31:47.993 --> 31:49.733
[Mallory]
I was in the hospital

31:49.777 --> 31:51.779
for a triple-threat cocktail
of IV antibiotics,

31:51.822 --> 31:53.694
four chest percussion
treatments a day,

31:53.737 --> 31:56.479
and 2,000 calories
of pure milky fat

31:56.523 --> 31:59.221
pumped into my veins daily
through my central line.

32:00.788 --> 32:04.139
I'd been battling my B. cepacia
for six years at this point.

32:04.183 --> 32:06.228
And that day, I was losing.

32:07.012 --> 32:08.317
[Mark]
One of the things that happens

32:08.361 --> 32:11.190
with B. cepacia
in cystic fibrosis lungs

32:11.668 --> 32:17.022
is it develops
antibacterial resistance.

32:17.065 --> 32:20.242
After every antibiotic,
three of them, four of them,

32:20.286 --> 32:22.027
her lung function is nothing.

32:22.331 --> 32:25.987
I was to tell Diane
and also Mallory

32:26.031 --> 32:28.642
that the germ is very resistant

32:28.685 --> 32:31.514
to almost all antibiotics
at that time.

32:31.558 --> 32:34.691
And remember, there's only
one and a half antibiotic

32:34.735 --> 32:37.651
that was sensitive
to this B. cepacia.

32:38.608 --> 32:40.045
[Mallory]
I woke up on my eighth day

32:40.088 --> 32:41.785
in the hospital
to a knock on the door.

32:41.829 --> 32:43.744
It was Dr. Pornchai.

32:43.787 --> 32:47.269
He said, "Mallory, your weight
has dropped yet again today,

32:47.791 --> 32:50.751
and your white blood count
has climbed to 19,000."

32:52.013 --> 32:54.929
Dr. Pornchai was running out
of ideas for what to do.

32:54.973 --> 33:00.021
And so, I did bronchoscopy
to try to clean her lung, get,

33:00.065 --> 33:01.762
get the secretion
out of her lungs

33:01.805 --> 33:03.285
as much as I could.

33:03.329 --> 33:05.070
[Mallory]
As I recovered from anesthesia,

33:05.113 --> 33:07.333
my body started shaking
violently and erratically

33:07.376 --> 33:10.336
as my temperature
rocketed to 106 degrees.

33:10.379 --> 33:13.904
I had sepsis,
an infection in my blood,

33:13.948 --> 33:17.038
and the infection in my lungs
was taking over.

33:17.082 --> 33:19.475
It was wreaking havoc
on my body.

33:19.519 --> 33:22.522
We didn't know if we could
fight it any longer.

33:23.001 --> 33:24.741
She was not doing that well.

33:24.785 --> 33:29.572
She has had a fever,
high fever, and...

33:29.616 --> 33:31.270
[Mallory]
I struggled against five nurses

33:31.313 --> 33:33.141
as they held
my convulsing limbs down

33:33.185 --> 33:35.839
and covered me with ice packs
and cold towels.

33:36.753 --> 33:39.408
We thought I had something
called cepacia syndrome,

33:39.452 --> 33:41.410
which is when people
who are infected

33:41.454 --> 33:43.282
with the bacteria B. cepacia

33:43.325 --> 33:46.676
begin to go into a period
of rapid decline,

33:47.329 --> 33:49.027
a progressive pneumonia

33:49.070 --> 33:51.246
that usually leads to death
within weeks.

33:53.031 --> 33:56.295
[heart monitor beeping]

33:56.338 --> 33:57.644
[Dr. Pornchai]
At that time, I just,

33:58.645 --> 34:03.911
we, we did everything,
but I, I told the family

34:03.954 --> 34:06.653
that this B. cepacia

34:06.696 --> 34:10.178
is the germ
that could, could kill Mallory.

34:11.266 --> 34:13.268
[heart monitor beeping]

34:13.312 --> 34:15.140
[Mallory] It took a few more
weeks in the hospital,

34:15.183 --> 34:17.272
and a few months
of home IV antibiotics.

34:18.752 --> 34:21.320
But eventually, my fever broke.

34:22.582 --> 34:26.020
[cheers and applause]

34:27.500 --> 34:29.458
[on video] [coughs]
We are reminded

34:29.502 --> 34:32.461
of how ephemeral life is and
of how quickly it all rushes by.

34:33.636 --> 34:36.596
This is the first day
of the rest of our lives.

34:36.857 --> 34:38.946
The first day
in which we get to decide

34:38.989 --> 34:42.515
what we want for ourselves,
and how we are going to get it.

34:43.168 --> 34:45.779
Take advantage of the freedom
you have earned

34:45.822 --> 34:47.128
and use it wisely.

34:47.172 --> 34:49.522
[graduates cheering]

34:49.565 --> 34:52.438
[♪♪♪♪♪]

34:55.136 --> 34:56.877
[Diane] I was very nervous.
I didn't want her to go.

34:56.920 --> 34:59.662
Mark was very much in favor
of her going to Stanford.

34:59.923 --> 35:01.229
He thought it was
the right school for her,

35:01.273 --> 35:03.013
and I called my brother,

35:03.057 --> 35:04.841
and I knew that he was there
and that helped.

35:05.668 --> 35:06.974
But was it my first choice?

35:07.017 --> 35:08.671
No.

35:08.715 --> 35:10.238
No, I would have kept her
10 minutes away at UCLA.

35:11.674 --> 35:13.285
[Mallory] My freshman year,

35:13.328 --> 35:17.158
I was on a clinical trial drug
that was amazing.

35:17.202 --> 35:20.248
Um, it kept my lung function
very stable,

35:20.292 --> 35:22.381
and I was actually not
hospitalized for 16 months,

35:22.424 --> 35:24.296
which was the longest
that I had been

35:24.339 --> 35:26.298
without a hospitalization
since I was 10.

35:27.690 --> 35:30.258
[Tyler] I was actually her RA.

35:30.302 --> 35:31.781
Right off the bat,
we became friends,

35:31.825 --> 35:34.132
and Diane was obviously
buzzing around as well.

35:34.175 --> 35:37.004
And one of the first things
that Diane was looking for

35:37.047 --> 35:39.137
when she came to the dorm

35:39.180 --> 35:41.182
was just like a closet
to store medical equipment.

35:41.226 --> 35:42.488
She kind of found me.

35:42.531 --> 35:44.011
We just found like a,

35:44.054 --> 35:45.186
basically a broom closet
and emptied it out,

35:45.230 --> 35:46.318
gave her the key.

35:47.667 --> 35:49.625
[Mallory]
I took over all of the aspects

35:49.669 --> 35:52.498
of my own health care,
managing my prescriptions,

35:52.541 --> 35:54.195
talking to insurance,

35:54.239 --> 35:55.544
making my own
doctor's appointments,

35:55.588 --> 35:57.024
going to the doctor alone,

35:57.067 --> 35:59.200
going to the ER alone,
all that kind of stuff.

35:59.548 --> 36:01.594
Um, and so it was
a very abrupt switch

36:01.637 --> 36:03.248
from pediatric care
to adult care,

36:03.291 --> 36:06.860
but I was very ready for it,
and I liked having that,

36:06.903 --> 36:08.340
that level of control.

36:10.951 --> 36:12.344
You know, it's just
my good fortune

36:12.387 --> 36:15.085
I got assigned her
as a frosh advisee.

36:15.129 --> 36:17.000
I remember being struck by it.

36:17.044 --> 36:20.047
You know, you get a letter
that they wrote.

36:20.090 --> 36:21.527
It cracked me up.

36:21.570 --> 36:22.658
It was, "I'm hoping
to live abroad.

36:22.702 --> 36:24.182
I speak Spanish

36:24.225 --> 36:26.271
but I'm also very interested
in New Zealand.

36:26.314 --> 36:28.969
I think that I want to do
something in the environment."

36:29.012 --> 36:32.015
As I was reading further in it,
it mentioned very briefly

36:32.059 --> 36:33.974
that she also had
cystic fibrosis.

36:34.017 --> 36:35.845
And I mean,
I remember this literally,

36:35.889 --> 36:38.196
I thought,
"I guess I misunderstood

36:38.239 --> 36:39.980
what cystic fibrosis is."

36:41.460 --> 36:43.418
They wanted to put her
in a single room.

36:44.027 --> 36:45.638
She said, "No."

36:45.681 --> 36:49.250
Mallory wanted to have
people in our room a lot, um,

36:49.294 --> 36:52.166
and so we kept our door open.
People would come in and out.

36:53.036 --> 36:54.690
[on video] You're listening
to Green Grid Radio

36:54.734 --> 36:57.780
on KZSU Stanford 90.1 FM.

36:59.129 --> 37:00.827
[Mallory] [voice-over]
We would go to yoga.

37:00.870 --> 37:04.004
We went to brunch a lot.
We went to parties.

37:04.047 --> 37:07.137
It was a pretty typical
college experience.

37:07.181 --> 37:12.447
She just wanted to
not be defined by her illness.

37:16.059 --> 37:18.061
[Charlotte]
I think Mallory was aware

37:18.105 --> 37:22.022
of wasting time, and diligent
about not wasting time.

37:22.065 --> 37:24.503
And that applied
to almost everything she did.

37:24.546 --> 37:26.331
She did it full throttle.

37:29.334 --> 37:30.900
She burned very bright.

37:31.597 --> 37:34.513
I used to tell her, "I wish
you didn't burn so bright,

37:35.557 --> 37:37.733
because bright bulbs
burn out faster."

37:41.084 --> 37:43.609
[Prof. McConnell]
I met Mallory when she was

37:43.652 --> 37:46.133
just starting
her sophomore year.

37:46.176 --> 37:48.701
Stanford has a program
called Sophomore College

37:48.744 --> 37:52.139
where I teach a course
on conservation photography.

37:52.182 --> 37:54.010
[Diane] She applied to
and was accepted to a program

37:54.054 --> 37:56.317
that sent her
to school a month before.

37:56.361 --> 37:58.014
And she didn't want me
to take her up.

37:58.058 --> 38:01.235
She wanted to do it on her own.
And I argued with her

38:01.279 --> 38:03.019
and ultimately
let her win that argument.

38:03.629 --> 38:05.239
[Prof. McConnell] Many students
sort of go through

38:05.283 --> 38:07.502
a journey of discovery,
which is exciting.

38:07.546 --> 38:09.374
But at the same time,
they're doing that

38:09.417 --> 38:13.378
in the context of academically
really intense courses.

38:13.421 --> 38:15.336
[Diane] She landed,
they hit the ground running

38:15.380 --> 38:16.903
with the program, and never
set up her room properly.

38:16.946 --> 38:19.340
Never got a chance to do
all of her treatments.

38:19.384 --> 38:20.863
Hi, Mom.

38:20.907 --> 38:22.343
[Mark] So this is
her new dorm room.

38:22.387 --> 38:24.040
-Hey, can I have--?
-This is my...

38:24.084 --> 38:25.912
-that's my desk over there.
-[girl 1] Hi.

38:25.955 --> 38:27.870
[girl 2] Hi.

38:29.002 --> 38:30.438
[Mark] Okay,
let's go in the bedroom.

38:30.482 --> 38:31.961
[Mallory]
Yeah, this is the bedroom.

38:32.005 --> 38:33.398
Very messy.

38:34.137 --> 38:36.096
-Which one's yours, by the way?
- This one.

38:36.139 --> 38:37.445
-[Mark] Oh, the blue one.
-[Mallory chuckles]

38:37.837 --> 38:39.142
Anything else you want to say?

38:39.186 --> 38:40.753
That's it.

38:40.796 --> 38:42.189
Can you tell
your mom how you miss her?

38:42.232 --> 38:43.843
-I miss you, Mom.
-[Mark laughs]

38:43.886 --> 38:45.758
[Diane] I got a phone call.

38:45.801 --> 38:47.673
She had had a massive bout
of hemoptysis.

38:47.716 --> 38:49.936
She ended up in the hospital.
I immediately flew up.

38:49.979 --> 38:51.894
You only had
two treatments yesterday.

38:51.938 --> 38:53.766
You went 12 hours,
nine hours without a treatment.

38:53.809 --> 38:55.463
-Doesn't affect my lungs.
-You didn't sleep.

38:55.507 --> 38:56.943
-That doesn't affect it.
-[Diane] I don't agree.

38:56.986 --> 38:58.814
[Mallory] Mom,
it's not your lungs.

38:58.858 --> 39:00.425
-How would you have any idea?
-[Diane] Sweetheart.

39:00.468 --> 39:02.383
-I think you...
-You've asked the doctors

39:02.427 --> 39:04.037
-[Diane] Let me just say...
-[Mallory] Just listen to me.

39:04.080 --> 39:05.995
You've asked them
time and time again,

39:06.039 --> 39:07.954
"Will skipping one treatment
affect her lung function?"

39:07.997 --> 39:09.956
-And they said no.
-But you didn't skip one.

39:09.999 --> 39:11.566
You skipped a few this week
and you slept at Danny's...

39:11.610 --> 39:13.612
-I skipped only one this week.
-[Diane] No.

39:13.655 --> 39:15.527
I'm telling you you're wrong,
and you need to listen to me

39:15.570 --> 39:17.050
because it's my body, it's my
lungs, I know what's going on.

39:18.965 --> 39:20.706
[Diane]
Mallory's doctors thought

39:20.749 --> 39:23.491
this exacerbation had been
caused by ataluren.

39:24.057 --> 39:26.842
They pulled her from the trial.
It was heartbreaking.

39:27.452 --> 39:29.105
When they took her off the drug,

39:29.715 --> 39:31.847
she got much worse, and then
she never really recovered.

39:33.588 --> 39:36.330
[Mallory] [voice-over] I woke up
every morning in a fog.

39:36.374 --> 39:39.202
[coughs] Every day, I lost
a little bit more hope.

39:39.812 --> 39:42.423
And every day, I started
to change my perception

39:42.467 --> 39:44.860
of my own self
a little bit more.

39:45.470 --> 39:48.037
Going from a healthy, dynamic,

39:48.081 --> 39:50.866
outgoing, competent young person

39:51.606 --> 39:55.523
to a sickly person
with no hope, no dreams.

39:56.785 --> 40:02.835
Seeing her in a hospital bed
the first few times was jarring.

40:02.878 --> 40:05.272
I had never spent
that much time in a hospital.

40:05.315 --> 40:09.668
It was like, "Wow, she's like

51:11.807 --> 51:14.375
acceptance and fighting back.

51:16.943 --> 51:20.990
The common wisdom is that
you should always be fighting

51:21.034 --> 51:23.123
and always dream big.

51:23.167 --> 51:26.170
But if you live
like that always,

51:26.213 --> 51:28.520
and you have
a very serious illness,

51:28.563 --> 51:29.869
you're just going to be
disappointed

51:29.912 --> 51:31.436
day after day after day.

51:31.827 --> 51:34.656
And so, I really feel like

51:34.700 --> 51:36.832
it's a balance between
striving for more

51:36.876 --> 51:38.878
and being happy
with what you have.

51:39.400 --> 51:41.228
[Susan Gottlieb]
It was hard to believe

51:41.272 --> 51:44.536
that she was so young and,
and her work ethic was,

51:44.579 --> 51:46.407
I mean, it was just incredible.

51:47.582 --> 51:49.454
[Mallory] I had always
held on to this idea

51:49.497 --> 51:51.325
that I was going to work
in sustainable development,

51:51.369 --> 51:53.545
and I was going to travel.

51:53.588 --> 51:55.199
And then one day,
I just had to accept

51:55.242 --> 51:57.766
that that wasn't a realistic
thing for me to do.

51:58.941 --> 52:00.595
Now, I'm very happy as a writer,

52:00.639 --> 52:01.727
as a freelance writer.

52:01.770 --> 52:03.598
I make my own schedule,

52:03.642 --> 52:05.165
I can write about things
that I'm passionate about.

52:08.037 --> 52:11.171
Because of the water situation
here in California,

52:11.215 --> 52:13.695
I just felt that, you know,
we had to start somewhere.

52:14.261 --> 52:16.872
So I started putting in
drought-tolerant plants.

52:16.916 --> 52:18.961
As I was doing more reading
and researching

52:19.005 --> 52:20.963
on drought-tolerant plants,

52:21.007 --> 52:23.749
I discovered that there was
such a thing as a native plant.

52:23.792 --> 52:26.230
And the more I read
about native plants,

52:26.273 --> 52:28.449
and how important
they are to the wildlife,

52:28.493 --> 52:31.670
I just got mesmerized
by that whole concept.

52:32.236 --> 52:35.369
And then I thought I should
maybe produce a book.

52:37.023 --> 52:39.025
You've probably seen
the picture of her

52:39.068 --> 52:43.203
working with her inhalator
and her, her jacket on.

52:43.247 --> 52:45.118
And she's working on my book
in that picture.

52:45.162 --> 52:47.294
And I just don't know
how many people

52:47.338 --> 52:48.730
would be able to do that.

52:49.818 --> 52:52.299
[Mallory]
I would say that my purpose

52:52.343 --> 52:56.216
is to give something back
within my lifetime.

52:58.000 --> 53:00.307
I used to envision that
in a lot of different ways.

53:00.351 --> 53:05.486
And now, I think that.
you can make a difference

53:05.530 --> 53:08.228
in big and small ways.

53:08.272 --> 53:09.882
And sometimes,
ways that seem small

53:09.925 --> 53:11.449
are actually really big.

53:14.060 --> 53:15.540
When Mallory moved
to Manhattan Beach,

53:15.583 --> 53:17.324
she had a few months
of relative stability

53:17.368 --> 53:19.892
and had a great time
at the beach and was so happy,

53:19.935 --> 53:22.286
the happiest I'd seen her
in a long time.

53:22.329 --> 53:25.898
-[Mallory] Aaah!
-[laughing] Oh.

53:25.941 --> 53:27.856
[Diane] And then,
she started to get sick.

53:27.900 --> 53:29.554
I never knew if,

53:29.597 --> 53:31.556
you know, the next day
I was going to be in the ER,

53:32.121 --> 53:34.907
or in the hospital, or whatever.

53:37.170 --> 53:40.129
For a young person
to be able to do all of that,

53:40.173 --> 53:43.872
and balance life,
a job, is a challenge.

53:43.916 --> 53:47.311
And in the meantime,
if you don't feel well,

53:47.354 --> 53:50.139
um, it's challenging
just to get through your day.

53:51.706 --> 53:56.145
Her lung function was already
in about the 40 percent range,

53:56.189 --> 53:59.323
that's entering into
the moderate to severe, um,

53:59.366 --> 54:02.239
range of lung function.

54:02.282 --> 54:05.111
[Mallory] [voice-over]
[coughs] Healthy people

54:05.154 --> 54:07.635
have thousands of bacteria
species present in the lungs.

54:07.679 --> 54:10.856
It's a diverse microbial
ecosystem that remains healthy

54:10.899 --> 54:12.858
because the diversity of species

54:12.901 --> 54:16.253
means no individual bacteria
can gain too much traction.

54:16.296 --> 54:18.211
But cystic fibrosis
makes this type

54:18.255 --> 54:20.387
of idyllic
polyculture impossible.

54:20.822 --> 54:22.433
Gone are the healthy bacteria

54:22.476 --> 54:24.435
present
in a healthy polyculture.

54:24.478 --> 54:26.480
Now I'm stuck
with a monoculture system

54:26.524 --> 54:29.396
perched atop airways that are
growing increasingly fragile

54:29.440 --> 54:31.572
from the endless assault.

54:31.616 --> 54:36.447
[coughing] To have your lungs
being destroyed from the inside

54:36.751 --> 54:39.363
feels like there's a boulder
sitting on your chest

54:39.885 --> 54:41.974
preventing you
from taking a deep breath.

54:43.149 --> 54:45.412
It feels like there's
little knives stabbing you

54:45.456 --> 54:47.632
in the bases of your lungs
every time you try to breathe

54:47.675 --> 54:49.373
or every time you cough.

54:49.416 --> 54:52.550
You could say it's the,

54:52.593 --> 54:55.857
it's the fear and disappointment
I experience every time

54:55.901 --> 54:59.034
I can no longer do something
I previously thought was easy.

54:59.078 --> 55:00.775
[on video] We just walked a ton.

55:01.254 --> 55:03.038
[Diane] [on video] I know, Mal.
That's really good,

55:03.082 --> 55:04.344
considering you haven't been
out of bed in a week.

55:05.171 --> 55:06.390
[Mallory] [voice-over]
Being short of breath

55:06.433 --> 55:08.174
is almost like a state of mind.

55:08.217 --> 55:10.350
It's hard to focus
on anything else

55:10.394 --> 55:12.396
when you have to focus
every minute on breathing.

55:12.439 --> 55:13.701
[machine thumping]

55:13.745 --> 55:15.834
[coughing]

55:15.877 --> 55:17.662
[Diane] And then
she went through a period

55:17.705 --> 55:20.491
of back-to-back hospitalizations
where they could not get control

55:20.534 --> 55:22.493
over the cepacia,
and ultimately,

55:22.536 --> 55:24.756
UCLA was calling Stanford
to consult,

55:24.799 --> 55:27.585
and Stanford finally
called me and said,

55:27.628 --> 55:29.282
"Time to bring her back."

55:29.326 --> 55:31.110
[Mallory] Last week,
I went to see my doctor

55:31.153 --> 55:32.894
at Stanford, my doctor there

55:32.938 --> 55:35.201
who's really the man
that I trust with my life.

55:35.244 --> 55:36.768
If I were on my deathbed,

55:36.811 --> 55:38.596
I would want him to be
the one making decisions.

55:38.639 --> 55:42.382
He advised that it would be best
if I put my health first

55:42.426 --> 55:48.170
at this point and focused on
spending at least six months

55:48.214 --> 55:49.955
or longer in the Bay Area

55:49.998 --> 55:51.739
so that I could be close
to Stanford Hospital

55:51.783 --> 55:56.309
so that he could sort of regain
some understanding of my,

55:56.353 --> 55:58.877
my situation
and so that I could be close

55:58.920 --> 56:00.444
to the people
who really specialize

56:00.487 --> 56:03.360
in my specific,
complicated issues.

56:04.883 --> 56:06.363
Yeah.

56:06.406 --> 56:08.452
I met Mallory
at a New Year's Eve party

56:08.495 --> 56:11.324
or New Year's Eve pregame
for a party.

56:11.368 --> 56:13.282
I thought she was really cute,
right off the bat.

56:13.326 --> 56:15.328
And at the time,
she was living in LA.

56:15.372 --> 56:16.895
And so, she was
in a different city,

56:16.938 --> 56:18.940
so I kind of wrote her off
in the beginning.

56:18.984 --> 56:20.768
I was like, "I don't
want to do long distance."

56:20.812 --> 56:22.770
And once I found out she moved,

56:22.814 --> 56:25.469
she was moving back
to the Bay Area, you know,

56:25.512 --> 56:27.819
I made sure whenever she was
at the next party

56:27.862 --> 56:29.516
and the mutual group
of friends we had

56:29.560 --> 56:31.910
that I was there to say hello.

56:31.953 --> 56:33.128
When she moved to San Francisco,

56:33.172 --> 56:34.695
I was living in San Francisco.

56:35.043 --> 56:37.437
You know, there were
more things happening

56:37.481 --> 56:39.744
that were changing
her decisions,

56:39.787 --> 56:43.269
as in she was starting to lose
more control over her decisions.

56:43.878 --> 56:45.750
[Talia]
She wasn't able to go out

56:45.793 --> 56:48.361
and do a lot
when she lived here.

56:48.405 --> 56:50.624
It was always just a lot
of activities at their apartment

56:50.668 --> 56:53.105
and it's a small
San Francisco apartment

56:53.148 --> 56:55.107
and you can't fit
that many people in there.

56:55.150 --> 56:58.415
So it just forced us all to get
to know each other a lot better.

56:59.024 --> 57:02.027
That's when she started
being on oxygen a lot more.

57:02.636 --> 57:04.812
It was difficult for her,
but she always

57:04.856 --> 57:07.467
kept a smile on her face
and stayed optimistic.

57:08.250 --> 57:10.427
[Talia] I went to go visit her
at the hospital.

57:10.470 --> 57:14.126
And I have this vivid memory
of asking Mallory

57:14.169 --> 57:15.519
who else was coming to visit her

57:15.562 --> 57:18.391
and she just kind
of coyly was like,

57:18.435 --> 57:20.959
"Oh, this guy
that I met at a party."

57:21.263 --> 57:24.745
And I was trying to get
more information out of her,

57:24.789 --> 57:26.355
but Diane was in the room,

57:26.399 --> 57:28.314
and she didn't really
want to say anything.

57:28.357 --> 57:29.576
What way my pickup line?
[chuckles]

57:29.620 --> 57:31.360
That's a good question.

57:31.404 --> 57:33.145
I think we would both say
that our turning point was

57:33.188 --> 57:37.758
when we sat down on the balcony
of the house party we were at.

57:37.802 --> 57:39.281
And we just talked about life.

57:39.325 --> 57:41.109
You know, I'm not gonna say

57:41.153 --> 57:44.112
that we had this insanely
deep conversation right away.

57:44.156 --> 57:45.679
But it was more
of the superficial things

57:45.723 --> 57:47.159
that we felt comfortable with

57:47.202 --> 57:49.030
in terms of
what brought us happiness.

57:49.074 --> 57:50.467
And we found a lot of
those things were the same.

online.

just being young, and you know,

58:20.192 --> 58:23.325
having the good fortune
to have a good education,

58:23.369 --> 58:26.894
and figuring out how
to use that in the world.

58:28.287 --> 58:31.290

58:31.333 --> 58:33.118
They liked to surf,
they liked the beach,

58:33.161 --> 58:35.163
they were laid-back.

58:35.207 --> 58:37.949
[Uncle Danny] He was obviously
madly in love with Mallory.

58:37.992 --> 58:40.081
She was madly in love with him.

58:40.125 --> 58:44.172
[Gaby] For her to be able
to have conversations about

58:44.216 --> 58:46.697
"Once this happens, we will."

58:46.740 --> 58:48.742
It had her looking forward.

58:48.786 --> 58:50.439
[Jack] There was nothing
standing in our way

58:50.483 --> 58:52.877
between pursuing love.

58:52.920 --> 58:54.531
You know, as long as
Mallory was alive,

58:54.574 --> 58:56.358
she was gonna fight for her life

58:56.402 --> 58:58.578
and for the love that she felt
for the people around her,

58:58.622 --> 59:00.449
and I was gonna fight
for her as well.

59:01.407 --> 59:03.148
So I was coaching
a Junior Olympics

59:03.191 --> 59:04.584
12 and under team and,
[clears throat]

59:04.628 --> 59:06.020
Junior Olympics happened to be

59:06.064 --> 59:07.935
up in the Stanford area
that year.

59:07.979 --> 59:09.415
So I texted her and said,

59:09.458 --> 59:11.417
"Hey, I'm gonna be
up in the Bay Area.

59:11.460 --> 59:12.766
We should meet for lunch."

59:12.810 --> 59:14.159
She said, "Okay, cool.
Let's do that."

59:14.202 --> 59:16.422
And then, by the time
I got up there,

59:16.465 --> 59:18.250
she had been admitted
to the hospital.

59:18.293 --> 59:20.295
So she said, "Well, you can
come visit in the hospital."

59:20.339 --> 59:23.255
So I went there,
and Diane was there.

59:23.864 --> 59:26.475
Dr. Mohabir
had actually been away.

59:26.519 --> 59:27.999
I think something happened
with his sister

59:28.042 --> 59:29.348
and he had been gone.

59:29.391 --> 59:30.610
And we hadn't seen him
in a while

59:30.654 --> 59:31.568
after we had moved
back up for him,

59:31.611 --> 59:33.004
and we were frustrated.

59:33.047 --> 59:35.441
And so, Coach Bowie
came to the room,

59:35.484 --> 59:37.051
and I said to Mallory,

59:37.095 --> 59:38.444
"I'm gonna get him
some food in the cafeteria,

59:38.487 --> 59:40.011
and we'll be back
in five minutes.

59:40.054 --> 59:40.881
Do you want anything?"
and we went to go get him

59:40.925 --> 59:42.100
some French fries.

59:42.709 --> 59:44.493
I was down
in the cafeteria with Diane.

59:44.537 --> 59:46.757
We were getting some food,
and Diane got either a text

59:46.800 --> 59:49.803
or a call from,
from Mallory's doctor.

59:50.456 --> 59:52.632
So we went back up to the room
and the doctor actually said,

59:52.676 --> 59:54.242
"You know,
maybe Rob should leave."

59:54.286 --> 59:56.114
And Diane and Mallory,
"No, no, he's family."

59:56.157 --> 59:57.855
Well, what Dr. Mohabir said

59:57.898 --> 59:59.857
was that the antibiotics
had done all that they could do

59:59.900 --> 1:00:02.207
and that she'd become
resistant to them.

1:00:02.729 --> 1:00:05.253
And he said that if they were
to withdraw the antibiotics,

1:00:05.297 --> 1:00:06.907
she wouldn't live a year.

1:00:06.951 --> 1:00:08.822
The doctor said that
no one would transplant her,

1:00:08.866 --> 1:00:11.172
and she should consider
going on hospice care,

1:00:11.608 --> 1:00:15.133
which basically means
just go home and die.

1:00:15.176 --> 1:00:16.961
I was crying,
Mallory was crying.

1:00:17.004 --> 1:00:18.963
Rob, I think was like
a deer in the headlights

1:00:19.006 --> 1:00:21.400
with his French fries
that were smelling the room up.

1:00:21.792 --> 1:00:24.403
It's one of those, you know,
visceral memories that you have.

1:00:24.446 --> 1:00:25.839
This is the first time
that I saw

1:00:25.883 --> 1:00:28.363
both her and Diane
kind of break.

1:00:28.407 --> 1:00:30.322
And it was, I mean, it was just,

1:00:30.365 --> 1:00:32.019
just got heavy like that.

1:00:32.063 --> 1:00:33.717
Uh, so she gave me the news

1:00:33.760 --> 1:00:37.590
with, I think, Mohabir
and her mom there and I was,

1:00:37.634 --> 1:00:39.679
I was trying to block it out
for the first couple minutes.

1:00:39.723 --> 1:00:41.159
And then this,

1:00:41.202 --> 1:00:43.291
the doctor and her mom
stepped out to,

1:00:43.335 --> 1:00:47.208
to give us some time,
and I completely broke down.

1:00:47.252 --> 1:00:49.558
The idea that the center

1:00:49.602 --> 1:00:51.169
where she'd been treated
for years and years

1:00:51.212 --> 1:00:54.694
wouldn't even evaluate her
or talk to her about it

1:00:54.738 --> 1:00:57.305
was very, very, very hurtful
to her.

1:00:57.697 --> 1:00:59.177
[Gaby] That's one of the lowest,

1:00:59.220 --> 1:01:03.660
I mean, she couldn't
brighten up that time.

1:01:05.357 --> 1:01:08.186
A little bit of disbelief.
I mean, you can't.

1:01:12.016 --> 1:01:13.539
It was dark.

1:01:17.412 --> 1:01:19.980
[somber violin playing]

1:01:25.029 --> 1:01:27.684
[birds chirping]

1:01:34.081 --> 1:01:35.779
[Diane] [voice-over]
The conversation

1:01:35.822 --> 1:01:37.345
with Dr. Mohabir
when he said he didn't think

1:01:37.389 --> 1:01:38.477
there was going to be
a transplant

1:01:38.520 --> 1:01:40.131
was really difficult.

1:01:40.174 --> 1:01:41.959
[Micah] When my sister
was talking about

1:01:42.002 --> 1:01:43.482
how the doctors
were telling her that,

1:01:43.525 --> 1:01:45.179
you know, they told her
that she should not

1:01:45.223 --> 1:01:48.661
even try to get one
and she wouldn't accept that.

1:01:48.705 --> 1:01:51.316
You know, I saw my mom,
my parents fighting to get it.

1:01:51.359 --> 1:01:52.839
So first of all,
it's important to understand

1:01:52.883 --> 1:01:56.190
that Diane and my mom
are extremely close.

1:01:56.234 --> 1:02:00.673
Um, and my mom had this line,
she'd say, "I don't do sad."

1:02:00.717 --> 1:02:04.677
And I think Diane adopted
the same thing, right?

1:02:04.721 --> 1:02:06.984
She just, you know,
her attitude was, I'm not,

1:02:07.027 --> 1:02:09.726
you know, no "pity parties".
I don't do sad.

1:02:09.769 --> 1:02:11.379
She's just gonna power through

1:02:11.423 --> 1:02:17.168
whatever was adversely
impacting her, um. period.

1:02:17.211 --> 1:02:18.996
And at that point,
I thought, well,

1:02:19.039 --> 1:02:20.911
I'm gonna ask for more help.

1:02:20.954 --> 1:02:22.608
And I found another doctor,
and I said,

1:02:22.651 --> 1:02:24.001
her name is Dr. Chhatwani,

1:02:24.044 --> 1:02:25.524
I said,
"Would you help Dr. Mohabir?

1:02:25.567 --> 1:02:27.482
He's not having any luck."

1:02:27.526 --> 1:02:30.355
And so, Dr. Chhatwani had
written some personal appeal

1:02:30.398 --> 1:02:33.488
in a chat room
for transplant centers.

1:02:33.532 --> 1:02:36.100
[Mark] We actively pursued
transplant

1:02:36.143 --> 1:02:38.624
even after being,
having discouraging news

1:02:38.667 --> 1:02:40.452
and rejections from people.

1:02:40.495 --> 1:02:44.195
And UPMC was the one name
that we had always heard

1:02:44.238 --> 1:02:46.806
that was willing
to take difficult cases.

1:02:46.850 --> 1:02:48.634
[man] One, two, three.

1:02:48.677 --> 1:02:50.592
[Dr. Pilewski] Yeah,
so when I first met Mallory,

1:02:50.636 --> 1:02:53.465
her lung function
was less than 30 percent.

1:02:53.508 --> 1:02:56.207
Among the spectrum of patients
we see for transplant,

1:02:56.250 --> 1:02:58.775
she was sick
and really needed it.

1:02:59.340 --> 1:03:02.430
So she was facing
transplant or death.

1:03:05.085 --> 1:03:07.131
Um, and from the very beginning,

1:03:07.174 --> 1:03:09.437
I sensed that there was a lot
of courage on Mallory's part,

1:03:09.481 --> 1:03:12.179
that she had a lot
she wanted to live for.

1:03:12.223 --> 1:03:13.702
She wasn't done.

1:03:14.965 --> 1:03:17.881
-[Diane] [on video] Hi, Mal!
-Hi!

1:03:17.924 --> 1:03:19.534
[Diane] [on video]
Here we are on August 13th.

1:03:19.578 --> 1:03:21.928
Mallory's about to take a swim

1:03:22.407 --> 1:03:24.452
in the manner
that allows her to breathe

1:03:24.496 --> 1:03:26.977
since she's using oxygen.
And here we go.

1:03:30.763 --> 1:03:32.809
Moving to Pittsburgh
was very traumatic.

1:03:32.852 --> 1:03:35.681
My mom had been diagnosed
with end-stage ovarian cancer,

1:03:35.724 --> 1:03:38.945
and so Mark made the decision
to stay back to be with Micah

1:03:38.989 --> 1:03:40.425
and to take care of my parents.

1:03:40.468 --> 1:03:41.730
And I went with Mallory.

1:03:41.774 --> 1:03:43.123
Wave to the camera.

1:03:43.167 --> 1:03:44.951
I just blocked it out,

1:03:44.995 --> 1:03:49.477
because I could not allow myself
to engage in the emotion

1:03:49.521 --> 1:03:52.306
that I would feel
if I were to really process

1:03:52.350 --> 1:03:54.091
what it was I was doing,

1:03:54.134 --> 1:03:55.701
to leave my mom at a time
when she was dying.

1:03:55.744 --> 1:03:57.355
I didn't want to leave my dad.

1:03:57.398 --> 1:03:59.357
[Mark] [on video]
Dad. Yes, Dad, wave.

1:03:59.400 --> 1:04:00.967
[Grandma] [on video] Maybe take
your hat off, sweetheart.

1:04:01.011 --> 1:04:02.708
[on video] My hair's not combed.

1:04:02.751 --> 1:04:04.492
[Aunt Meryl]
You know, when we got

1:04:04.536 --> 1:04:07.452
my mother's diagnosis,
I remember telling my daughter,

1:04:07.495 --> 1:04:10.759
and she was, you know,
quiet for a few beats.

1:04:10.803 --> 1:04:12.544
And then she said,
"Maybe it's good."

1:04:12.587 --> 1:04:14.024
And I said, "Why?"

1:04:14.067 --> 1:04:15.677
And she said,
"Because if Mallory dies,

1:04:15.721 --> 1:04:17.505
Grandma would lose her mind."

1:04:21.596 --> 1:04:24.121
I was terribly lonely.

1:04:25.687 --> 1:04:30.170
I didn't socialize very much,
and I talked to them every day.

1:04:31.171 --> 1:04:33.043
I went, I went to them
when I could.

1:04:34.696 --> 1:04:36.350
What was shocking
about Pittsburgh

1:04:36.960 --> 1:04:40.093
was how sick she was,
how different it was.

1:04:40.137 --> 1:04:42.835
I mean, everything was so hard.

1:04:42.879 --> 1:04:46.143
And I think that was hard
for her, just in itself.

1:04:46.447 --> 1:04:48.972
She was tired.

1:04:49.015 --> 1:04:51.583
It was a lot of work,
a lot of treatments.

1:04:51.626 --> 1:04:53.454
She was on oxygen.

1:04:53.498 --> 1:04:55.717
She became
a lot more comfortable

1:04:56.370 --> 1:04:59.025
talking about the fact
that she was scared

1:04:59.069 --> 1:05:00.679
and just what it meant

1:05:00.722 --> 1:05:02.463
if she couldn't get
a lung transplant,

1:05:02.507 --> 1:05:04.857
or what it meant if she could,

1:05:04.901 --> 1:05:07.077
and what that surgery was gonna
look like and that, you know,

1:05:07.120 --> 1:05:08.948
she could die
on the operating table.

1:05:08.992 --> 1:05:12.734
I was living in LA.
Um, I was worried for her.

1:05:13.083 --> 1:05:14.998
-[Jack] Surprise!
-What!

1:05:15.041 --> 1:05:16.651
[Jack] I would come to
visit Mallory once a month.

1:05:16.695 --> 1:05:18.697
Oh, my God.

1:05:18.740 --> 1:05:20.655
[Jack] I think anyone who goes
through a transplant,

1:05:20.699 --> 1:05:22.135
especially
a double lung transplant,

1:05:22.179 --> 1:05:24.094
which is harder to get,

1:05:24.137 --> 1:05:26.661
the demand for transplants
is much higher than the supply.

1:05:27.749 --> 1:05:31.579
Every day, the call could come
from an unknown number

1:05:31.623 --> 1:05:33.930
with a Pittsburgh area code
of whether or not

1:05:33.973 --> 1:05:35.757
you get to live
another 10 years,

1:05:35.801 --> 1:05:39.283
and that was
a surreal mindset to be in.

1:05:39.326 --> 1:05:41.981
I think Mallory
said it best is, um,

1:05:42.025 --> 1:05:43.896
she tried to get the best
out of life every day.

1:05:43.940 --> 1:05:46.029
But some days,
all she could do was persist

1:05:46.464 --> 1:05:48.248
and just survive
to live another day.

1:05:49.293 --> 1:05:50.816
[Diane] [on video] Hi, Mal.

1:05:50.859 --> 1:05:52.209
[on video] Hi.

1:05:56.909 --> 1:05:58.998
She was hospitalized
several times

1:05:59.042 --> 1:06:01.958
here in Pittsburgh
from acute infections.

1:06:02.610 --> 1:06:04.264
And so we were, we were worried

1:06:04.308 --> 1:06:06.397
that she wasn't going
to get her opportunity.

1:06:06.440 --> 1:06:09.574
You know, she would expire
before a suitable donor

1:06:09.617 --> 1:06:11.576
would be, would be available.

1:06:12.969 --> 1:06:14.971
[on video] Uh, things seem to be

1:06:15.754 --> 1:06:17.234
getting worse instead of better.

1:06:17.277 --> 1:06:19.366
I have no flu anymore,

1:06:19.410 --> 1:06:22.065
but we think
it's cepacia syndrome

1:06:22.108 --> 1:06:26.983
with fevers
and shortness of breath and pain

1:06:27.026 --> 1:06:30.682
and symptoms that we cannot
get under control,

1:06:30.725 --> 1:06:34.468
and seems like I'm resistant,
to, with the antibiotics.

1:06:34.512 --> 1:06:36.775
So, we'll see what happens.

1:06:36.818 --> 1:06:39.647
My boyfriend
just left town, Jack,

1:06:39.691 --> 1:06:43.173
he went to San Diego,
and I miss him.

1:06:44.217 --> 1:06:45.610
That's all.

1:06:48.047 --> 1:06:50.528
[Dr. Pilewski] I think
it takes a commitment

1:06:50.571 --> 1:06:54.053
to do more than just
what's in the textbooks,

1:06:54.097 --> 1:06:57.100
and maybe even more than
what's in the current journals,

1:06:57.143 --> 1:06:59.363
and what the FDA
has available to you,

1:06:59.406 --> 1:07:02.061
and say, "Well, let's push
the envelope."

1:07:02.105 --> 1:07:08.459
I started looking into ways
to get lungs for Mallory

1:07:08.502 --> 1:07:11.462
that would avoid
the scarcity problem.

1:07:12.115 --> 1:07:13.551
I did some research

1:07:13.594 --> 1:07:15.640
and found that there were
some people

1:07:15.683 --> 1:07:19.165
working on taking lungs
from pigs.

1:07:19.209 --> 1:07:22.168
I was keen on, on that idea

1:07:22.212 --> 1:07:27.826
because if pig lungs could be
used for human transplants,

1:07:27.869 --> 1:07:30.220
then there wouldn't be
a shortage.

1:07:30.263 --> 1:07:32.700
And then, and then
Mallory's lungs

1:07:32.744 --> 1:07:35.094
wouldn't have to be
allocated to someone

1:07:35.138 --> 1:07:37.009
who didn't have B. cepacia.

1:07:37.314 --> 1:07:40.012
I networked
through a friend and,

1:07:40.056 --> 1:07:42.362
and got to this professor
at Harvard,

1:07:42.406 --> 1:07:44.930
and he wrote back and said
that he didn't think

1:07:44.973 --> 1:07:48.194
that the transplantation
from another species

1:07:48.238 --> 1:07:50.109
would be ready any time soon,

1:07:50.153 --> 1:07:52.546
but that I ought to look
into other possibilities

1:07:52.590 --> 1:07:56.898
for clearing the infection,
including phage therapy.

1:07:56.942 --> 1:07:59.553
I read about bacteriophages,

1:08:00.163 --> 1:08:03.296
which is Greek
for "bacteria-eater."

1:08:03.340 --> 1:08:04.993
A researcher in Canada

1:08:05.037 --> 1:08:08.910
had successfully eliminated
a B. cepacia infection

1:08:09.215 --> 1:08:12.479
in a cystic fibrosis
knockout mouse.

1:08:12.523 --> 1:08:14.046
He explained to me

1:08:14.090 --> 1:08:18.050
that phages are
naturally occurring organisms,

1:08:18.442 --> 1:08:22.402
so therapies based on them
can't really be patented.

1:08:22.446 --> 1:08:24.361
So even if it could
save someone's life,

1:08:24.404 --> 1:08:26.014
no one can make money on it.

1:08:26.058 --> 1:08:27.973
And if no one
can make money on it,

1:08:28.016 --> 1:08:31.411
then no one is going to spend
the millions of dollars it takes

1:08:31.977 --> 1:08:36.024
to do a double-blind
placebo-controlled trial

1:08:36.068 --> 1:08:37.983
meeting FDA standards.

1:08:38.418 --> 1:08:42.292
So that was too far away
from the clinic.

1:08:42.335 --> 1:08:44.555
-[laughter]
-[woman] [on video] So, Mal.

1:08:44.598 --> 1:08:47.297
How do you feel about
potentially getting new lungs?

1:08:47.340 --> 1:08:49.342
[Mallory] [on video]
I feel stoked.

1:08:49.386 --> 1:08:51.127
-[woman] [on video] Stoked.
-[Mallory] [on video] Stoked.

1:08:51.170 --> 1:08:52.302
[woman] [on video]
Diane, how do you feel

1:08:52.345 --> 1:08:53.912
about Mallory's new lungs?

1:08:53.955 --> 1:08:55.522
We can't see your fingers.

1:08:55.566 --> 1:08:57.176
[laughing]

1:08:57.220 --> 1:08:58.743
[Gaby] Talia was there.

1:08:59.222 --> 1:09:01.006
And they called me,
and they said,

1:09:01.049 --> 1:09:03.356
"She just got called
for transplant.

1:09:03.400 --> 1:09:05.924
You need to come."
I was like, "Okay."

1:09:05.967 --> 1:09:08.492
So I got on a plane immediately.

1:09:09.667 --> 1:09:16.108
And they came in at six
in the morning, and they said,

1:09:16.978 --> 1:09:19.155
"Okay, we're taking you
down to pre-op."

1:09:19.198 --> 1:09:21.026
And I was like, "Oh, shit."

1:09:21.069 --> 1:09:25.465
By seven, we're down there,
and they tell us, you know,

1:09:25.509 --> 1:09:27.380
"They're good lungs,
but someone else got 'em."

1:09:27.424 --> 1:09:29.861
[Jack] I got in in time
for the doctor to tell us

1:09:29.904 --> 1:09:31.428
that no, they were going to
someone else.

1:09:31.471 --> 1:09:33.430
We were mortified
because nobody had told us

1:09:33.473 --> 1:09:35.127
that Mallory was a backup,

1:09:35.171 --> 1:09:37.347
and we didn't even know
that that was actually a thing.

1:09:37.912 --> 1:09:41.089
So we all went out
for Mediterranean food

1:09:41.133 --> 1:09:42.526
at 11 o'clock in the morning.

1:09:42.569 --> 1:09:44.180
And I remember
Mallory saying to me,

1:09:44.223 --> 1:09:46.051
"Mom, this meal was amazing.

1:09:46.094 --> 1:09:48.096
And if I'd gotten
the transplant,

1:09:48.445 --> 1:09:50.142
I would not have had
this delicious meal

1:09:50.186 --> 1:09:51.622
with all my friends."

1:09:51.665 --> 1:09:54.146
And I realized
that was her secret.

1:09:54.190 --> 1:09:56.235
No matter how much shit
was thrown at her,

1:09:56.496 --> 1:10:00.413
she was able to rebound
and resurface and move forward.

1:10:00.457 --> 1:10:02.285
She just felt
very fortunate despite,

1:10:02.328 --> 1:10:04.896
um, the poor hand
she'd been dealt.

1:10:05.288 --> 1:10:07.725
She felt betrayed
by being dealt that hand,

1:10:07.768 --> 1:10:10.597
but she also felt blessed by
the opportunities that she had.

1:10:12.599 --> 1:10:13.992
[man] Okay.
Un momento. Un momento.

1:10:14.035 --> 1:10:15.733
[Mallory] Oh, Maria.

1:10:16.342 --> 1:10:19.302
[conversation on phone]

1:10:19.345 --> 1:10:22.130
Oh, stop, stop.
Okay. What are you--?

1:10:22.174 --> 1:10:23.349
Tell her that
she's makin' her cry.

1:10:23.393 --> 1:10:24.872
That's not okay.

1:10:24.916 --> 1:10:26.222
-We cannot make her cry.
-[man] It's not bad.

1:10:26.265 --> 1:10:27.745
No. Tell her
not to make her cry.

1:10:28.572 --> 1:10:31.052
This is, this is
the happy time of the night.

1:10:31.096 --> 1:10:33.707
The tears, the tears are when
they tell us it's not viable.

1:10:34.360 --> 1:10:35.840
[man] Okay.

1:10:35.883 --> 1:10:37.320
-Tell her that she has to...
-[man] Okay.

1:10:37.363 --> 1:10:39.104
-Tell her I miss her.
-No pity parties.

1:10:39.147 --> 1:10:42.455
[Mallory] [crying] It's
definitely a stressful process

1:10:42.499 --> 1:10:46.546
to get the call,
have it not go your way,

1:10:46.590 --> 1:10:48.200
get another call,
have it not go your way,

1:10:48.244 --> 1:10:50.376
get another call,
have it not go your way.

1:10:50.420 --> 1:10:52.248
By the time the fourth call
comes around,

1:10:52.291 --> 1:10:55.251
it's sort of hard to believe
that it really will happen.

1:10:55.555 --> 1:10:58.558
So I think I spent most of
the day in a state of disbelief,

1:10:58.602 --> 1:11:00.168
and it's only really now
hitting me

1:11:00.212 --> 1:11:01.692
that it actually might happen.

1:11:02.301 --> 1:11:04.738
In the five-month period
where I got no calls

1:11:04.782 --> 1:11:06.566
in between the first two
dry runs and these,

1:11:06.610 --> 1:11:10.266
and then the last one,
it started to just feel like

1:11:10.309 --> 1:11:13.312
it was never gonna happen,
and we were just going to be

1:11:13.356 --> 1:11:15.009
living in Pittsburgh
for years and years

1:11:15.053 --> 1:11:18.317
with no news
on this transplant, so.

1:11:18.361 --> 1:11:21.015
-[coughing]
-[background conversation]

1:11:24.280 --> 1:11:26.630
[machine beeping]

1:11:26.673 --> 1:11:28.022
And then she said
it took four times,

1:11:28.066 --> 1:11:29.328
which makes it seem like
it's happening.

1:11:29.372 --> 1:11:30.547
-Oh.
-Guys, picture?

1:11:30.590 --> 1:11:32.070
-Oh, well.
-Holy shit, Talia.

1:11:32.113 --> 1:11:33.811
[Mark] Don't read,
don't read into this.

1:11:33.854 --> 1:11:35.116
I'm sorry. I'm reading into
every little everything.

1:11:35.160 --> 1:11:36.335
-All right.
-Oh, there's Jack.

1:11:36.379 --> 1:11:37.597
-He wants his goodbye.
-Bye.

1:11:39.077 --> 1:11:40.121
[Jack] [over phone] Bye, Mal.
Love you tons.

1:11:40.165 --> 1:11:41.906
I love you too.
Wish you were here.

1:11:42.646 --> 1:11:45.213
[Jack] [over phone] Wish I was
too. Super proud of you.

1:11:45.257 --> 1:11:47.085
They will give you updates
as they get them.

1:11:47.128 --> 1:11:48.434
Yeah.

1:11:49.130 --> 1:11:51.045
Oh, boy.

1:11:51.089 --> 1:11:53.700
I'll get in bed, Mark, go
ahead. You can hug her first.

1:11:53.744 --> 1:11:55.311
I want the last hug.

1:11:55.963 --> 1:11:57.182
[indistinct chattering]

1:12:00.054 --> 1:12:01.491
[Mallory] Thank you.

1:12:09.586 --> 1:12:10.891
[Talia] Guess I picked
the wrong side.

1:12:10.935 --> 1:12:12.937
[laughs]

1:12:14.504 --> 1:12:16.462
[Diane] They're just grabbing
an O2 tank.

1:12:16.506 --> 1:12:17.855
You're perfect now.

1:12:21.815 --> 1:12:23.077
[woman] Thank you.

1:12:23.121 --> 1:12:25.645
[Talia]
I knew I saw her in there

1:12:25.689 --> 1:12:27.125
-through the years.
-[woman] Okay.

1:12:27.168 --> 1:12:28.344
[Talia] That's good.

1:12:28.387 --> 1:12:30.433
[Mallory crying]

1:12:34.262 --> 1:12:36.090
[Talia] Guess I should
take a picture.

1:12:37.440 --> 1:12:39.485
Okay. Perfect.
All right, thank you.

1:12:46.623 --> 1:12:51.062
-[heart monitor beeping]
-[muted chatter]

1:12:51.105 --> 1:12:53.020
[Doctor] The lungs look okay.
I think it's gonna be fine.

1:12:53.064 --> 1:12:55.632
But I want to put 'em
on the machine, okay?

1:12:55.675 --> 1:12:56.850
Okay, all right.

1:12:56.894 --> 1:12:59.592
[muted chatter]

1:13:02.856 --> 1:13:05.685
[machine hissing, beeping]

1:13:10.951 --> 1:13:12.388
[Diane] You worry,

1:13:12.431 --> 1:13:14.128
"Is my child gonna die
on the table?

1:13:14.172 --> 1:13:15.695
Is my child gonna make it
through surgery?"

1:13:21.353 --> 1:13:23.268
[Mark] I was, half of me thought

1:13:23.311 --> 1:13:25.096
that I might never
see her again.

1:13:26.140 --> 1:13:28.491
-[nurse] Okay, Doctor?
-[doctor] Yeah.

1:13:28.534 --> 1:13:30.406
-[nurse] We're ready for ya.
-[doctor] All right.

1:13:30.449 --> 1:13:34.148
[Mark] Um, half of me
knew that I would.

1:13:34.192 --> 1:13:35.628
[nurse] Just hold on the lungs.

1:13:35.672 --> 1:13:37.413
[doctor] All right,
so the right lung's out.

1:13:38.109 --> 1:13:40.459
[machine beeping]

1:13:50.469 --> 1:13:53.603
It's unlike anything
to see your daughter

1:13:53.646 --> 1:13:56.083
who was tethered to oxygen
before the surgery

1:13:56.127 --> 1:13:58.477
and who you thought wasn't ever
gonna get a transplant

1:13:58.521 --> 1:14:01.480
because of the cepacia
be able to sit up

1:14:01.524 --> 1:14:04.135
and without oxygen
take this breath.

1:14:04.178 --> 1:14:06.442
And it wasn't smooth like...
[breathes deeply]

1:14:07.660 --> 1:14:09.880
you know, it was
challenging for her,

1:14:09.923 --> 1:14:11.838
but it was really
quite exciting.

1:14:15.581 --> 1:14:17.453
[Diane] [on video] You wanna
smile? One, two, three.

1:14:17.496 --> 1:14:19.846
-Two, three.
-[woman] [on video] Smile.

1:14:19.890 --> 1:14:21.195
[Diane] [on video]
Is she doing well or what?

1:14:21.239 --> 1:14:22.849
[woman] [on video] Yeah.

1:14:22.893 --> 1:14:24.634
[Mallory] [voice-over]
I feel like people with CF

1:14:24.677 --> 1:14:26.026
are privy to secrets
it takes most other people

1:14:26.070 --> 1:14:27.898
a lifetime to understand.

1:14:27.941 --> 1:14:30.509
[nurse] [on video] Here's
Mallory walking down the hall.

1:14:30.553 --> 1:14:32.293
[Mallory]
How lucky we are to be alive.

1:14:34.557 --> 1:14:36.515
How lucky anyone is
who has their health.

1:14:37.647 --> 1:14:39.170
How we should be appreciative

1:14:39.213 --> 1:14:40.693
of anything
that's in our control

1:14:40.737 --> 1:14:43.391
since our health
is most often not.

1:14:43.435 --> 1:14:45.132
[cheering]

1:14:45.176 --> 1:14:47.091
That we can leave behind
a legacy when we go

1:14:47.134 --> 1:14:48.484
that will impact others.

1:14:50.137 --> 1:14:52.488
That simple things are often
the most beautiful.

1:14:52.836 --> 1:14:54.490
That love and happiness

1:14:54.533 --> 1:14:56.535
are the most important things
to strive for.

1:14:59.495 --> 1:15:01.366
That ultimately,
we shouldn't give a damn

1:15:01.409 --> 1:15:02.933
what other people think

1:15:02.976 --> 1:15:04.891
because everyone's making
their own way,

1:15:04.935 --> 1:15:06.589
and everyone's facing
different struggles

1:15:06.632 --> 1:15:08.112
that other people
aren't aware of.

1:15:08.678 --> 1:15:11.898
CF has given me my value system
and ultimately,

1:15:11.942 --> 1:15:14.727
no matter how hard it is,
I'm grateful for it.

1:15:18.339 --> 1:15:22.343
Mallory Smith is getting ready
to celebrate her 25th birthday.

1:15:22.387 --> 1:15:23.910
It's just three days away.

1:15:23.954 --> 1:15:26.783
That may not sound
extraordinary, but it is.

1:15:26.826 --> 1:15:29.481
You see, she believes doctors
here in Pittsburgh

1:15:29.525 --> 1:15:30.613
saved her life.

1:15:30.656 --> 1:15:32.615
They did. They did.

1:15:32.658 --> 1:15:34.355
The doctors there
are just my heroes,

1:15:34.399 --> 1:15:37.881
because they took a chance on me
when nobody else would.

1:15:39.186 --> 1:15:40.840
[interviewer]
You get emotional about it.

1:15:40.884 --> 1:15:42.581
[Mallory] [voice-over]
The pain is temporary

1:15:42.625 --> 1:15:43.843
and then you get to live
the rest of your life

1:15:43.887 --> 1:15:45.628
with being able to breathe.

1:15:46.106 --> 1:15:47.717
Yeah. The big moment for us

1:15:47.760 --> 1:15:49.719
was being able
to leave the hospital

1:15:49.762 --> 1:15:52.286
and she was still on antibiotics
at that time,

1:15:52.330 --> 1:15:54.593
but she no longer needed oxygen.

1:15:54.637 --> 1:15:57.596
She was breathing through
a 100 percent viable lungs,

1:15:57.640 --> 1:15:59.424
normal person lungs,

1:15:59.467 --> 1:16:01.513
and we were able to go
on a walk in the crisp fall air

1:16:01.557 --> 1:16:04.037
and watch a local kickball game

1:16:04.081 --> 1:16:06.605
between like two
beer-drinking teams.

1:16:06.649 --> 1:16:09.652
And [chuckles]
we really enjoyed ourselves,

1:16:09.695 --> 1:16:11.784
'cause Mal never got tired.
We never needed to wait.

1:16:11.828 --> 1:16:16.006
And our hopes were
at a peak at that time,

1:16:16.049 --> 1:16:19.487
'cause we were talking about
plans to move back to LA,

1:16:19.531 --> 1:16:21.489
how long that would be,
where she would want to live,

1:16:21.533 --> 1:16:24.841
and we were full
of happiness and joy.

1:16:24.884 --> 1:16:29.323
♪ Ditch plastic
It's fantastic ♪

1:16:39.203 --> 1:16:41.640
I think it was about
a week after her birthday

1:16:41.684 --> 1:16:44.164
that she started getting fevers.

1:16:44.208 --> 1:16:46.166
And that's a danger sign,

1:16:46.210 --> 1:16:49.387
because the fever's a sign
of a bacterial infection.

1:16:49.996 --> 1:16:53.086
And the risk
in B. cepacia transplants

1:16:53.130 --> 1:16:55.915
is that the B. cepacia
will reinfect the new lungs

1:16:55.959 --> 1:16:57.830
'cause of the drugs
that you take

1:16:57.874 --> 1:17:01.094
to suppress your immune system
to prevent rejection.

1:17:01.138 --> 1:17:03.096
[Dr. Pilewski]
And Mallory unfortunately

1:17:03.140 --> 1:17:08.406
developed a pneumonia
from her Burkholderia.

1:17:08.449 --> 1:17:11.061
It was necrotizing pneumonia
that was going fast,

1:17:11.104 --> 1:17:13.150
and they showed me
the X-ray pictures

1:17:13.193 --> 1:17:14.717
of it going up your lungs.

1:17:14.760 --> 1:17:16.893
First, when your lungs
are newly transplanted,

1:17:16.936 --> 1:17:18.808
it's all black,
the black is good.

1:17:18.851 --> 1:17:21.854
And then there's the white film
that starts creeping up.

1:17:23.203 --> 1:17:25.205
It's, you don't
want to believe it.

1:17:26.554 --> 1:17:28.339
[nurse]
Every single person...

1:17:28.382 --> 1:17:29.819
[Jack] I don't think
I was ready to accept that,

1:17:29.862 --> 1:17:32.735
especially after the hope
and happiness

1:17:32.778 --> 1:17:35.607
that we had just shared
over that last visit together.

1:17:35.651 --> 1:17:37.174
I didn't want that to go away.

1:17:37.217 --> 1:17:40.351
We hadn't felt that in months,
almost a year.

1:17:41.221 --> 1:17:44.224
[Diane] She was on a crazy
complicated round of IVs.

1:17:44.877 --> 1:17:46.662
I just wasn't going
to give up hope.

1:17:47.358 --> 1:17:52.711
I was working feverishly
to try to find new antibiotics,

1:17:52.755 --> 1:17:56.672
and there was one
that was hopeful

1:17:57.150 --> 1:17:58.848
that came from Japan

1:17:58.891 --> 1:18:01.372
that hadn't been approved
in the United States yet,

1:18:01.415 --> 1:18:03.287
but it didn't work.

1:18:03.330 --> 1:18:05.245
[Diane] That's when
Mark read an article

1:18:05.289 --> 1:18:08.640
about an extraordinary scientist
named Steffanie Strathdee,

1:18:08.684 --> 1:18:12.426
who saved her husband from
a superbug using phage therapy.

1:18:13.123 --> 1:18:17.649
I reached out to them.
And Steffanie sent out a tweet

1:18:17.693 --> 1:18:20.739
to phage researchers
all over the world

1:18:20.783 --> 1:18:23.220
trying to find people
who had phages

1:18:23.263 --> 1:18:25.701
that were active
against B. cepacia.

1:18:26.353 --> 1:18:29.487
And we were successful,
we found two of them.

1:18:32.490 --> 1:18:35.928
I never say no to an idea,
unless it's dangerous.

1:18:35.972 --> 1:18:37.930
And this clearly
was not dangerous,

1:18:37.974 --> 1:18:41.020
saying we're going to take
a bacterial isolate

1:18:41.064 --> 1:18:43.457
to try and identify
a novel therapy.

1:18:44.328 --> 1:18:45.808
Sure, let's do it.

1:18:45.851 --> 1:18:46.939
[phone text notification]

1:18:46.983 --> 1:18:49.725
[heart monitor beeping]

1:18:50.900 --> 1:18:52.510
[phone text notification]

1:18:56.296 --> 1:18:58.690
So there's a process
of identifying a phage

1:18:58.734 --> 1:19:01.867
that's active against
the specific bacterium.

1:19:02.215 --> 1:19:04.652
And then that phage
has to be grown up

1:19:04.696 --> 1:19:06.654
in sufficient quantities to use

1:19:07.220 --> 1:19:10.441
and prepared such that
there's not a contaminant.

1:19:10.484 --> 1:19:13.400
That process evolved
in Mallory's case

1:19:13.444 --> 1:19:15.054
at breakneck speed,

1:19:15.707 --> 1:19:19.624
in large part by having
three teams of people

1:19:19.667 --> 1:19:22.192
who were really,
really committed to it.

1:19:22.845 --> 1:19:26.805
The Navy Biomedical Weapons
facility in Maryland

1:19:26.849 --> 1:19:28.459
had been researching that
for a while

1:19:28.502 --> 1:19:30.722
for soldiers coming back
from overseas

1:19:30.766 --> 1:19:33.420
with these really random
superbugs that no one had seen.

1:19:33.464 --> 1:19:34.813
They wanted to treat them.

1:19:34.857 --> 1:19:36.815
And also some
Canadian firms that

1:19:36.859 --> 1:19:39.165
had been researching phages
academically.

1:19:39.209 --> 1:19:41.951
And so,
Mark was able to combine,

1:19:41.994 --> 1:19:45.128
along with
Steffanie Strathdee's help,

1:19:45.868 --> 1:19:51.134
this global research group
for saving his daughter.

1:19:51.177 --> 1:19:53.963
She was definitely
not feeling well.

1:19:54.006 --> 1:19:56.661
She was like,
"Sorry I can't talk more."

1:19:56.704 --> 1:19:58.271
And then they told her,

1:19:58.315 --> 1:19:59.838
"Look, we need to put you
on the respirator."

1:20:00.230 --> 1:20:05.322
And that sucked, because,
you know, those were,

1:20:05.365 --> 1:20:09.456
those were signs to her
that things were really bad.

1:20:09.805 --> 1:20:12.546
That was an incredible time
for, for her and her family

1:20:12.590 --> 1:20:15.332
because sort of
on a day-to-day basis,

1:20:15.375 --> 1:20:17.551
you'd see these tiny glimpses
of getting better.

1:20:17.595 --> 1:20:19.727
Fevers would abate
for a day and a half,

1:20:20.728 --> 1:20:22.643
and then fevers would come back.

1:20:24.080 --> 1:20:27.561
[Jack] I was on the night watch,
two a.m. to 10 a.m.

1:20:28.084 --> 1:20:31.652
And in the middle of the night,
she shook me awake, you know,

1:20:31.696 --> 1:20:33.437
and I was like, "Oh,
what's wrong? What's wrong?

1:20:33.480 --> 1:20:35.700
You need something like
water, bathroom, nurse?

1:20:35.743 --> 1:20:37.441
What's?" You know,
I was ready to fight.

1:20:37.484 --> 1:20:40.052
[laughs] And she was like,
"No, I need to write."

1:20:40.096 --> 1:20:42.402
And so I got her a pen
and pad of paper.

1:20:43.577 --> 1:20:46.929
And she wrote me this note
that read,

1:20:46.972 --> 1:20:49.409
"You have so far exceeded
my expectation

1:20:49.453 --> 1:20:51.150
of what is possible for love."

1:20:53.718 --> 1:20:55.589
It was a beautiful moment,
and of course,

1:20:55.633 --> 1:20:57.940
I assured Mallory
that I felt the same way.

1:21:00.986 --> 1:21:02.553
I don't believe
that I called people.

1:21:02.596 --> 1:21:05.643
I think what I did
was I posted on Facebook,

1:21:05.686 --> 1:21:07.863
and I said,
"The doctors have said

1:21:07.906 --> 1:21:11.257
that anybody that should be
here should come today."

1:21:11.301 --> 1:21:13.085
And 30 people
got on a plane and came.

1:21:13.129 --> 1:21:15.305
[heart monitor beeping]

1:21:20.788 --> 1:21:22.529
[Uncle Danny] I just remember,
it was kind of a blur.

1:21:22.573 --> 1:21:24.009
You know, it was late.

1:21:24.053 --> 1:21:26.620
We went into some waiting room.
There was food.

1:21:26.664 --> 1:21:28.622
There were people there
all around the table.

1:21:29.449 --> 1:21:33.714
Mallory was in her room
down the hall.

1:21:34.672 --> 1:21:36.717
[Jack] Things were getting
very scary, um.

1:21:37.414 --> 1:21:39.851
but Diane was adamant
that we don't tell her

1:21:39.895 --> 1:21:41.374
that she was dying.

1:21:41.418 --> 1:21:43.246
And she wanted Mallory
to keep fighting

1:21:43.289 --> 1:21:45.030
while we were stalling for time

1:21:45.074 --> 1:21:47.772
to get that medicine
created and shipped to us.

1:21:52.124 --> 1:21:53.734
[Diane] She knew
that Mark was fighting

1:21:53.778 --> 1:21:55.823
for her life,
and she knew that we were

1:21:55.867 --> 1:21:57.260
getting her the phage.

1:21:57.303 --> 1:21:59.392
And I said to Mallory,

1:21:59.436 --> 1:22:02.352
"I'm very grateful
that you allowed Dad to do this

1:22:02.395 --> 1:22:05.964
because it's gonna save you,
and hopefully, it's gonna save

1:22:06.008 --> 1:22:07.661
hundreds of thousands
of other lives."

1:22:08.793 --> 1:22:10.316
[Dr. Pilewski]
The phages were, were prepared

1:22:10.360 --> 1:22:11.752
and ready to go

1:22:11.796 --> 1:22:13.929
but there were
transportation issues.

1:22:14.320 --> 1:22:17.497
And our, our transplant
surgeon, Dr. D'Cunha,

1:22:17.541 --> 1:22:21.849
managed to work with his people
who do transportation for organs

1:22:21.893 --> 1:22:24.200
and finagle a way
to get the phages

1:22:24.243 --> 1:22:27.420
transported here
as expeditiously as possible.

1:22:27.464 --> 1:22:30.032
[helicopter whirring]

1:22:30.075 --> 1:22:32.773
[man] Is this wild phages?
It is insane.

1:22:32.817 --> 1:22:34.906
Come on, phages.

1:22:34.950 --> 1:22:36.473
[woman] Oh, my God, I'm crying.
Oh, my God.

1:22:36.516 --> 1:22:37.778
That's the batch.

1:22:37.822 --> 1:22:40.085
That's nice work.

1:22:40.129 --> 1:22:41.869
[man] [on video] All right, Mal.

1:22:41.913 --> 1:22:44.568
[woman] [on video]
We are walking the phages

1:22:44.611 --> 1:22:46.004
down the hall,

1:22:46.048 --> 1:22:48.311
down the wall.
Here we are.

1:22:48.354 --> 1:22:49.790
We're walking in.

1:22:50.487 --> 1:22:52.358
These are the phages.

1:22:52.402 --> 1:22:55.274
[Diane] [on video] Oh, my God.
Can I give you a hug?

1:22:56.145 --> 1:22:58.582
Thank you so much.

1:22:58.625 --> 1:22:59.931
Yeah, don't drop 'em.

1:22:59.975 --> 1:23:01.628
[Diane] [on video]
What do we do?

1:23:01.672 --> 1:23:02.673
[man] [on video] Yeah,
I'll hold them for now.

1:23:02.716 --> 1:23:04.022
Thank you.[laughs]

1:23:04.066 --> 1:23:05.676
[woman] [on video]
Don't drop 'em.

1:23:05.719 --> 1:23:06.982
[Mark] The phages
were administered at,

1:23:07.025 --> 1:23:08.722
at about six p.m.

1:23:09.419 --> 1:23:15.599
One variety was given
into the, the right lung.

1:23:17.514 --> 1:23:19.516
and the other one was given
in the left lung.

1:23:21.083 --> 1:23:26.001
And then a microdose
was given intravenously.

1:23:26.044 --> 1:23:28.655
[machine beeping]

1:23:30.918 --> 1:23:32.311
[muted chatter]

1:23:35.227 --> 1:23:39.101
We were planning to dose her
with them every 12 hours.

1:23:39.710 --> 1:23:42.017
And the next morning,
when they were preparing

1:23:42.060 --> 1:23:45.194
the second round of doses
for her,

1:23:46.108 --> 1:23:49.807
we had a heart-to-heart
with the doctor who told us

1:23:49.850 --> 1:23:52.418
that even if
we pulled Mallory back

1:23:52.462 --> 1:23:54.203
from the brink of death here,

1:23:54.855 --> 1:23:56.466
her blood oxygen
had been depressed

1:23:56.509 --> 1:23:59.338
for so long she would suffer
permanent brain damage.

1:23:59.382 --> 1:24:01.688
So I remember
being in the room with Mallory

1:24:01.732 --> 1:24:04.604
and Diane came in
and she was teary and saying,

1:24:04.648 --> 1:24:07.346
"It's not working.
It's not, it's not,

1:24:08.043 --> 1:24:09.566
it's not happening."

1:24:09.609 --> 1:24:13.483
[heart monitor beeping]

1:24:13.526 --> 1:24:16.094
And it felt like
a knife through the chest.

1:24:17.182 --> 1:24:18.879
Yeah, knowing
that we were gonna have to

1:24:18.923 --> 1:24:20.751
take her
off life support, and...

1:24:22.405 --> 1:24:24.059
I knew that's what she wanted.

1:24:25.756 --> 1:24:27.497
[Mark] And we were all
touching Mallory,

1:24:27.888 --> 1:24:29.977
holding her hand or feet,
rubbing her feet,

1:24:30.021 --> 1:24:32.023
or touching her, her legs.

1:24:32.067 --> 1:24:33.851
[sniffling]

1:24:33.894 --> 1:24:34.939
And...

1:24:37.202 --> 1:24:41.554
We just saw her pulse rate fall

1:24:43.252 --> 1:24:46.298
and her respiration rate fall
and her blood pressure fall.

1:24:46.342 --> 1:24:51.912
And then about
ten minutes to five, her,

1:24:51.956 --> 1:24:53.610
her pulse stopped.

1:24:55.220 --> 1:24:58.093
[slow piano notes playing]

1:24:59.833 --> 1:25:02.532
[waves lashing]

1:25:11.541 --> 1:25:14.500
[birds chirping]

1:25:24.858 --> 1:25:27.078
We wanted to see
whether the phages

1:25:27.122 --> 1:25:31.648
had reached their targets
and had started to work.

1:25:32.344 --> 1:25:34.172
And the autopsy did confirm

1:25:34.216 --> 1:25:36.696
that the phages
had already started

1:25:36.740 --> 1:25:40.439
killing the B. cepacia germs
and multiplying the phage.

1:25:41.962 --> 1:25:44.182
And Mallory's case

1:25:44.617 --> 1:25:47.403
and the publicity
that we got for it

1:25:47.446 --> 1:25:52.059
have sparked a resurgence
of interest in phage therapy,

1:25:52.930 --> 1:25:55.802
especially for
cystic fibrosis patients,

1:25:55.846 --> 1:25:58.457
and several dozen patients
have been treated,

1:25:58.936 --> 1:26:01.982
and some lives have been saved.

1:26:03.636 --> 1:26:05.464
Not all of them.

1:26:05.508 --> 1:26:08.163
You know, a lot of them
got it too late, like Mallory.

1:26:10.469 --> 1:26:15.170
And I would like to see
that timeframe moved up.

1:26:21.219 --> 1:26:22.786
[Dr. Pilewski] We learn
from patients like Mallory

1:26:22.829 --> 1:26:24.179
about what
we could do different.

1:26:24.222 --> 1:26:27.182
We have, we have
this phage collaborative

1:26:27.225 --> 1:26:31.186
going on right now,
encouraged by Mark and Diane.

1:26:31.969 --> 1:26:33.623
So those efforts
will hopefully allow us

1:26:33.666 --> 1:26:37.975
to get more patients
through the first year or two

1:26:38.018 --> 1:26:40.412
after transplant
'cause that's really where

1:26:40.456 --> 1:26:42.414
the biggest landmines are.

1:26:43.285 --> 1:26:46.505
People get through the first
three, four, or five years

1:26:46.549 --> 1:26:49.204
after transplant
without major complications,

1:26:49.552 --> 1:26:53.251
most of those patients are
going to live ten, 15, 20 years.

1:26:53.947 --> 1:26:55.949
So, that's our hope.

1:26:58.256 --> 1:26:59.344
We'll get there.

1:27:00.389 --> 1:27:03.087
[inhaling]

1:27:09.441 --> 1:27:12.314
[mellow music playing]

1:27:25.544 --> 1:27:28.373
[approaching footsteps]

1:27:31.724 --> 1:27:33.073
[Diane] [voice-over]
When we moved to Pittsburgh

1:27:33.117 --> 1:27:34.640
for the transplant

1:27:34.684 --> 1:27:36.555
and she was afraid
she might not make it,

1:27:36.599 --> 1:27:39.079
Mallory finally gave me
the password to her journal,

1:27:39.558 --> 1:27:41.125
and told me not to read it

1:27:41.168 --> 1:27:42.996
if she made it
through transplant,

1:27:43.040 --> 1:27:44.650
but that if something
happened to her,

1:27:44.694 --> 1:27:46.304
she wanted me to open it,

1:27:46.348 --> 1:27:48.306
and there would be
instructions inside.

1:27:48.350 --> 1:27:51.527
What I found was 2,500 pages

1:27:51.570 --> 1:27:54.530
of her carefully recorded
thoughts over 10 years.

1:27:54.573 --> 1:27:57.750
I also discovered
a treasure trove of audio.

1:27:58.360 --> 1:28:01.232
She was very happy,
and she chose to live happy,

1:28:01.276 --> 1:28:03.016
and that was her mantra.

1:28:03.060 --> 1:28:05.454
But at the same time,
I think she suffered immensely,

1:28:05.497 --> 1:28:07.325
and I don't think
anybody had any idea

1:28:07.369 --> 1:28:10.459
of how deeply she suffered
until I read the journal.

1:28:10.502 --> 1:28:13.157
And then I said,
"Wow, I missed this."

1:28:14.637 --> 1:28:16.769
Going through a third transplant

1:28:16.813 --> 1:28:24.037
during a pandemic like COVID-19
has been incredibly scary.

1:28:24.081 --> 1:28:27.650
I was not able to have family
or friends with me at all.

1:28:28.128 --> 1:28:31.044
I could only bring a few items
with me to the hospital.

1:28:31.480 --> 1:28:36.485
And I chose to bring this book
because I just,

1:28:36.528 --> 1:28:38.965
I see it, and I see strength.

1:28:39.270 --> 1:28:41.098
And I also knew because
my family wasn't there,

1:28:41.141 --> 1:28:45.668
I was gonna need something
to make me feel less lonely,

1:28:45.711 --> 1:28:48.323
and that was Mallory's book.

1:28:49.149 --> 1:28:52.065
[mellow music]

1:28:58.420 --> 1:29:00.770
[keyboard keys clicking]

1:29:03.729 --> 1:29:05.514
[Mark]
These are Mallory's words.

1:29:06.732 --> 1:29:09.779
"I'm back in the hospital
thinking about what I want.

1:29:09.822 --> 1:29:12.085
I want to wake up in the morning

1:29:12.129 --> 1:29:14.087
and take a deep, full breath.

1:29:14.958 --> 1:29:17.221
I want that breath
to fill me up,

1:29:17.264 --> 1:29:19.832
to imbue me with joy and energy,

1:29:19.876 --> 1:29:22.182
not to irritate or pain me

1:29:22.226 --> 1:29:24.446
and set off a spasm of coughing.

1:29:25.621 --> 1:29:27.710
I want to be able to do
the things that I dream of."

1:29:27.753 --> 1:29:29.364
"That I dream of while I sleep.

1:29:29.407 --> 1:29:31.409
Things that are
taxing in reality.

1:29:31.453 --> 1:29:35.239
Hiking, running, biking,
swimming, diving, kicking,

1:29:35.282 --> 1:29:40.026
screaming, dancing, laughing,
jumping, falling, leaping,

1:29:40.070 --> 1:29:41.376
-soaring."
-[Caleigh] "Soaring.

1:29:41.419 --> 1:29:42.812
I want to get to know
another person

1:29:42.855 --> 1:29:45.249
without fearing
what they will think

1:29:45.292 --> 1:29:48.252
when they truly understand
the way my body works.

1:29:48.861 --> 1:29:51.429
I want to trust that my body
will be able to help me,

1:29:51.473 --> 1:29:55.172
not hinder me,
in living out my dreams."

1:29:55.781 --> 1:29:57.783
"I want to know
that when my closest friends

are sitting on the porch
at age 80,

I'll be sitting there
with them."

1:30:01.918 --> 1:30:03.006
"I'll be sitting there
with them,

1:30:03.049 --> 1:30:04.486
reminiscing, smiling,

1:30:04.529 --> 1:30:06.662
weeping, talking,
drifting, chuckling."

1:30:08.228 --> 1:30:11.406
[exhales]
"I want to fall in love.

1:30:14.583 --> 1:30:16.933
[sniffles]

and have a relationship
that's reciprocal.

of taking care of a spouse

1:30:25.898 --> 1:30:28.074
who's needy."

1:30:28.118 --> 1:30:30.163
"I want to have a child
but more than that,

1:30:30.207 --> 1:30:32.078
I want to hope to have a child

1:30:32.122 --> 1:30:36.474
without the nagging worry that
the dream is entirely foolish.

1:30:36.518 --> 1:30:37.780
And when I have this child,

1:30:37.823 --> 1:30:39.651
I want to be able
to pick her up,

1:30:39.695 --> 1:30:41.044
carry her around."

1:30:41.087 --> 1:30:42.349
"Climb trees with her,

1:30:42.393 --> 1:30:44.264
play with her in the jungle gym,

1:30:45.222 --> 1:30:47.920
teach her how to swim,
dance with her in the kitchen,

1:30:47.964 --> 1:30:49.879
show her
the most beautiful hikes,

1:30:49.922 --> 1:30:52.359
be there to push her
into her first wave.

1:30:53.491 --> 1:30:55.841
and keep up with her
fireball energy of youth."

1:30:56.581 --> 1:30:58.714
[Maya] "I want to effect
change in the world.

1:30:59.976 --> 1:31:03.370
I want my life goals not
to end as solely surviving.

1:31:03.414 --> 1:31:05.416
I want to live largely,
[sniffles]

1:31:05.460 --> 1:31:07.505
richly, vastly."

1:31:07.549 --> 1:31:09.333
"Dynamically, lovingly,

1:31:09.376 --> 1:31:12.423
graciously, eternally,
and ephemerally."

1:31:13.250 --> 1:31:16.645
"I want to feel amazement
and wonder every day."

1:31:16.688 --> 1:31:18.211
"I want to never lose sight

1:31:18.255 --> 1:31:19.778
of my place
in the thread of humanity

1:31:19.822 --> 1:31:21.388
and the fabric of the earth."

1:31:21.432 --> 1:31:25.088
"In the palace
that is this universe."

1:31:25.131 --> 1:31:27.743
"I want friendship,
happiness, humor."

1:31:27.786 --> 1:31:30.049
"Laughter, lightheartedness."

1:31:30.093 --> 1:31:32.530
"Small conquerable worries."

1:31:32.574 --> 1:31:34.706
"To want these things is normal,

1:31:34.750 --> 1:31:37.492
to expect them is dangerous."

1:31:37.535 --> 1:31:38.884
"Do I have to abandon

1:31:38.928 --> 1:31:40.712
my beautiful idea
of what life is?"

1:31:40.756 --> 1:31:42.497
"Do I have to abandon
these fantasies

1:31:42.540 --> 1:31:43.889
as possibilities for me,

1:31:43.933 --> 1:31:45.848
to refashion my idea
of the future?"

1:31:46.501 --> 1:31:48.154
"To settle for just surviving,

1:31:48.198 --> 1:31:49.547
breath by breath?"

1:31:49.591 --> 1:31:51.984
"Breath by breath,
one day at a time,

1:31:52.028 --> 1:31:54.509
sacrificing the very idea
of dreams

1:31:54.552 --> 1:31:56.554
to prevent disappointment.

1:31:57.120 --> 1:32:00.210
Only if I allow disappointment
to crush my spirit.

1:32:00.253 --> 1:32:01.646
I am happy today."
