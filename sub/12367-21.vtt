WEBVTT

00:02.877 --> 00:04.254
-<i> HOT IN CLEVELAND</i>
IS RECORDED

00:04.337 --> 00:06.381
IN FRONT OF
A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:06.464 --> 00:08.132
- YOUR WEDDING DAY

00:08.216 --> 00:10.969
IS AN OCCASION
OF GREAT JOY.

00:11.052 --> 00:13.972
NOTHING GIVES MORE HOPE
FOR THE FUTURE

00:14.055 --> 00:16.975
THAN A YOUNG BRIDE
WALKING DOWN THE AISLE

00:17.058 --> 00:19.436
WITH THE BLUSH OF INNOCENCE
ON HER CHEEK,

00:19.519 --> 00:21.604
JOINING HANDS
WITH THE GROOM,

00:21.688 --> 00:23.648
EAGER AND NERVOUS,

00:23.732 --> 00:26.735
BARELY MORE
THAN A BOY HIMSELF.

00:30.530 --> 00:34.117
YOU KNOW, I'M GONNA CALL
A TIMEOUT RIGHT NOW.

00:34.200 --> 00:36.244
I REALIZE THAT YOU
WANTED ME TO TALK TO YOU

00:36.327 --> 00:38.288
LIKE ANY YOUNG COUPLE
ABOUT TO GET MARRIED,

00:38.371 --> 00:43.918
BUT GIVEN YOUR...
"LIFE EXPERIENCE,"

00:44.002 --> 00:45.962
MAYBE WE CAN SKIP OVER
A FEW THINGS.

00:46.045 --> 00:48.965
- NO, WE WANT YOU
TO GO COMPLETELY BY THE BOOKS.

00:49.048 --> 00:51.134
- WE WANT THIS
TO FEEL LIKE THE FIRST TIME.

00:51.217 --> 00:53.470
PLEASE CONTINUE.

00:53.553 --> 00:55.180
- OKAY. WELL, THE NEXT THING
I USUALLY DISCUSS

00:55.263 --> 00:57.307
IS THE WEDDING NIGHT.

00:57.390 --> 01:00.018
YOU KNOW,
FAMILY PLANNING AND SUCH.

01:01.227 --> 01:02.604
YOU GOT
ANY QUESTIONS THERE?

01:02.687 --> 01:07.150
- NO. WE'RE GOOD
IN THAT AREA.

01:07.233 --> 01:08.443
- ALL RIGHT,
WELL, WHAT KIND OF CEREMONY

01:08.526 --> 01:10.153
DID YOU HAVE IN MIND?

01:10.236 --> 01:12.530
- UH, SOMETHING SIMPLE,
TASTEFUL.

01:12.614 --> 01:13.531
- I HAD A THOUGHT--

01:13.615 --> 01:16.993
- OOH, NO, YOU DIDN'T.
NO, UH...

01:17.076 --> 01:18.203
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
THE ADVICE

01:18.286 --> 01:20.163
I GIVE ALL GROOMS

01:20.246 --> 01:22.165
WHEN IT COMES
TO WEDDING PLANNING.

01:22.248 --> 01:25.335
GO LIMP.

01:25.418 --> 01:27.462
NOT ONE PART OF THIS DAY
IS ABOUT YOU.

01:27.545 --> 01:29.798
- ALL I WAS TRYING TO SAY--
- OKAY, SEE,

01:29.881 --> 01:32.509
THERE'S THAT WORD "I" AGAIN.

01:32.592 --> 01:34.844
THAT'S GONNA CAUSE YOU
NOTHING BUT TROUBLE.

01:34.928 --> 01:38.223
AND WHATEVER YOU DO,
WHEN SPEAKING TO YOUR BRIDE,

01:38.306 --> 01:40.809
NEVER USE THE WORD "RELAX"

01:40.892 --> 01:45.355
OR REFER TO ANYTHING AS BEING
"NOT THAT BIG A DEAL."

01:45.438 --> 01:47.023
- BUT THE MUSIC--

01:47.106 --> 01:48.358
- OKAY.
BUT, YOU SEE, FRED,

01:48.441 --> 01:50.026
REALLY, COME ON NOW.

01:52.320 --> 01:54.030
YOU KNOW THAT
LITTLE PART OF YOUR MIND

01:54.113 --> 01:56.199
THAT MAKES JUDGMENTS,

01:56.282 --> 01:58.409
THAT THINKS THAT,
"OH, THIS IS DUMB"

01:58.493 --> 02:00.370
OR "THAT'S UNNECESSARY"?

02:00.453 --> 02:03.081
I WANT YOU
TO TURN THAT OFF RIGHT NOW.

02:03.164 --> 02:05.208
JUST SHUT YOUR BRAIN DOWN

02:05.291 --> 02:08.211
AND DO WHAT
YOUR WOMAN SAYS.

02:08.294 --> 02:09.378
AND BY THE WAY,

02:09.461 --> 02:12.715
THAT IS ALSO MY ADVICE
FOR THE MARRIAGE.

02:12.799 --> 02:15.802
- WE PICKED
THE RIGHT MINISTER.

02:27.647 --> 02:29.607
{\an8}- OH, I'M SO EXCITED!
WE GET TO HAVE A WEDDING!

02:29.691 --> 02:32.402
{\an8}- WELL, MY FAVORITE WEDDING
WAS DEFINITELY MY THIRD.

02:32.485 --> 02:34.529
{\an8}- YOU MEAN TO
YOUR GAY HUSBAND?

02:34.612 --> 02:37.407
{\an8}- WELL, I DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS
AT THE TIME.

02:37.490 --> 02:39.033
{\an8}OH, HE JUST TOOK CARE
OF EVERYTHING.

02:39.117 --> 02:40.368
{\an8}HE DESIGNED THE DRESS,
AND THE CAKE,

02:40.451 --> 02:43.413
{\an8}AND THE FLOWERS, AND...

02:43.496 --> 02:45.373
{\an8}HE DID MY HAIR AND MAKEUP,
AND HE WOULDN'T REST

02:45.456 --> 02:47.876
{\an8}UNTIL HE FOUND
THE RIGHT PAIR OF HEELS.

02:49.210 --> 02:50.628
{\an8}- AND YET YOU HAD NO CLUE

02:50.712 --> 02:53.089
{\an8}THERE MIGHT BE PROBLEMS
IN THE ACTUAL MARRIAGE.

02:53.173 --> 02:56.259
{\an8}- WELL, WHAT AM I?
A DETECTIVE?

02:56.342 --> 02:58.052
{\an8}NO, I MEAN, I SUPPOSE
I MIGHT'VE BEEN TIPPED OFF

02:58.136 --> 02:59.929
{\an8}BY THE FACT
THAT HIS BACHELOR PARTY

03:00.013 --> 03:03.099
{\an8}WAS JUST A QUIET DINNER
WITH HIS BEST MAN.

03:03.182 --> 03:06.561
{\an8}IN SAN FRANCISCO.

03:06.644 --> 03:10.148
{\an8}FOR AN ENTIRE WEEKEND.
[clears throat]

03:10.231 --> 03:12.525
{\an8}- OOH, HERE'S
THE BLUSHING BRIDE NOW!

03:12.609 --> 03:14.110
{\an8}DID YOU BRING US
YOUR WEDDING ALBUM?

03:14.193 --> 03:16.279
{\an8}- THIS IS IT.
- WHAT? ONE PICTURE?

03:16.362 --> 03:19.324
{\an8}- OH, ELKA,
YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL!

03:19.407 --> 03:20.783
{\an8}- OH!

03:20.867 --> 03:23.411
{\an8}- I WAS MISS TEEN POTATO.

03:23.494 --> 03:25.663
{\an8}IN POLAND,
THAT'S AS GOOD AS IT GETS.

03:25.747 --> 03:28.291
{\an8}- OH, WELL, LOOK AT
THAT FRESH FACE AND THAT HAIR.

03:28.374 --> 03:30.293
{\an8}AND, OH,
THAT TINY LITTLE WAIST.

03:30.376 --> 03:32.086
{\an8}- AND I'LL SAY IT--
NICE RACK!

03:32.170 --> 03:33.171
{\an8}- [laughs]

03:33.254 --> 03:34.797
{\an8}- YOU LOOK LIKE A TEENAGER.

03:34.881 --> 03:36.799
{\an8}- I <i> WAS</i> A TEENAGER.

03:36.883 --> 03:38.509
{\an8}- OH, AND WERE YOU A VIRGIN
ON YOUR WEDDING NIGHT?

03:38.593 --> 03:40.762
{\an8}- YOU DON'T GET TO BE
MISS TEEN POTATO

03:40.845 --> 03:43.431
{\an8}WITHOUT PEELING
A FEW SKINS.

03:52.482 --> 03:53.983
{\an8}- WELL, ELKA, WE HAVE
A SURPRISE FOR YOU.

03:54.067 --> 03:55.485
{\an8}AS OUR WEDDING GIFT TO YOU,

03:55.568 --> 03:57.654
{\an8}WE WOULD LIKE TO PLAN
AND PAY FOR EVERYTHING.

03:57.737 --> 03:59.155
{\an8}- MM-HMM.
- OH, THAT'S NOT NECESSARY.

03:59.238 --> 04:00.990
{\an8}I JUST WANT
SOMETHING SIMPLE.

04:01.074 --> 04:02.450
{\an8}- WELL, WE CAN
TOTALLY DO SIMPLE!

04:02.533 --> 04:04.494
{\an8}YOU KNOW, I HEAR THAT
UNDER 200 GUESTS

04:04.577 --> 04:06.829
{\an8}IS VERY CHIC RIGHT NOW.
- MM-HMM.

04:06.913 --> 04:08.331
{\an8}- SO WE COULD GET AWAY
WITH TWO TENTS.

04:08.414 --> 04:09.666
{\an8}- CHAMBER INSTEAD OF
A FULL ORCHESTRA.

04:09.749 --> 04:11.501
{\an8}- MAYBE JUST THREE HORSES
FOR THE CARRIAGE.

04:11.584 --> 04:12.877
{\an8}- OH, WAIT.

04:12.961 --> 04:15.672
{\an8}ALL I WANT
ARE A FEW CLOSE FRIENDS

04:15.755 --> 04:18.007
{\an8}AS I EXCHANGE VOWS
BEFORE GOD

04:18.091 --> 04:20.426
{\an8}WITH THE MAN I ADORE.

04:20.510 --> 04:22.512
{\an8}- WELL, THAT'S JUST SAD.

04:24.764 --> 04:26.057
{\an8}- YOU JUST NEED
TO DO SOME RESEARCH.

04:26.140 --> 04:27.517
{\an8}WE'VE GOT BRIDE MAGAZINES,

04:27.600 --> 04:29.352
{\an8}AND THERE'S
A TON OF WEDDING SHOWS

04:29.435 --> 04:31.270
{\an8}YOU CAN DOWNLOAD.
- YEAH, YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE

04:31.354 --> 04:33.314
THAT EVERY DETAIL
IS PERFECT.

04:33.398 --> 04:35.692
REMEMBER, ALL EYES
WILL BE ON YOU.

04:35.775 --> 04:38.027
- THAT'S TRUE.

04:38.111 --> 04:39.862
THIS WAS
A LONG TIME AGO.

04:39.946 --> 04:41.030
[doorbell rings]

04:41.114 --> 04:43.324
- OH, GOOD! IT'S HERE.
- WHAT IS?

04:43.408 --> 04:46.536
- WHAT'S GOING TO HELP US PAY
FOR THIS WEDDING AND MORE.

04:46.619 --> 04:49.163
- OH, ALL RIGHT.
WELL, HERE, START STUDYING.

04:53.793 --> 04:56.546
- THANK YOU.

04:56.629 --> 04:58.715
OKAY, YOU REMEMBER
WHEN I DID THAT COMMERCIAL

04:58.798 --> 05:00.925
FOR MRS. LADYPANTS?

05:01.009 --> 05:03.720
- OH, YEAH,
YOUR DIAPER PANTS.

05:03.803 --> 05:06.389
- THEY WEREN'T DIAPERS.
THEY ARE ACTIVEWEAR SLACKS.

05:06.472 --> 05:07.598
- THAT YOU PEE IN.

05:07.682 --> 05:11.352
[laughter]

05:11.436 --> 05:13.563
- LOOK, THEY DIDN'T AIR ANY
OF THOSE COMMERCIALS IN AMERICA,

05:13.646 --> 05:15.732
AND THEY'RE PAYING ME A BUNDLE
TO TRY THEIR NEWEST PRODUCT.

05:17.650 --> 05:19.736
"DEAR CHASE VICTORIA,

05:19.819 --> 05:22.572
"MILLION OF WOMEN
TRUST MRS. LADYPANTS,

05:22.655 --> 05:27.577
"NUMBER ONE
FOR FRESHNESS OF CROTCH.

05:27.660 --> 05:30.038
"NOW CROTCH-FRESH FEELINGS
CAN WHISPER ALL OVER

05:30.121 --> 05:33.291
"WITH MRS. LADYPANTS
FOR BODY.

05:33.374 --> 05:35.126
"FEED YOUR GARBAGE DAILY

05:35.209 --> 05:37.879
WITH OUR SINGLE-USE
FRESHNESS JUMPSUITS."

05:42.133 --> 05:43.968
- SO THEY'RE
DISPOSABLE DIAPER CLOTHES?

05:44.052 --> 05:46.971
- NO. THEY ARE
EXPERIMENTAL PROTOTYPES.

05:47.055 --> 05:48.306
I'M SUPPOSED TO WEAR THEM
DAY AND NIGHT

05:48.389 --> 05:49.640
FOR THE NEXT WEEK.

05:49.724 --> 05:53.102
UH, "YOU WILL FEEL
SO MUCH HAPPY

05:53.186 --> 05:55.438
"YOU WILL MAKE WATER

AND NOW SWEATING."

06:06.866 --> 06:09.243
[laughter]

06:15.166 --> 06:18.336
- AAH!
- JOY, GET UP! NOW!

06:18.419 --> 06:20.755
- ELKA, WHAT IS IT?
- YOU WERE RIGHT!

06:20.838 --> 06:23.382
MY WEDDING
NEEDS TO BE BIG!

06:23.466 --> 06:26.260
YOU'RE MY WEDDING PLANNER!

06:26.344 --> 06:27.595
- WHY ME?

06:27.678 --> 06:29.305
- BECAUSE MELANIE'S
TOO NICE,

06:29.388 --> 06:31.349
AND VICTORIA'S
TOO CRAZY.

06:31.432 --> 06:34.143
YOU'VE GOT JUST
THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF BITCH

06:34.227 --> 06:36.646
TO GET THE JOB DONE.

06:36.729 --> 06:39.816
- OH, I'M FLATTERED
THAT YOU CHOSE ME.

06:39.899 --> 06:42.568
I KNOW WE'VE
NEVER BEEN CLOSE, BUT--

06:42.652 --> 06:43.986
- THIS IS NOT
A SWEET MOMENT!

06:44.070 --> 06:47.281
GET YOUR BONY ASS
OUT OF BED!

06:50.910 --> 06:52.662
- WOW! YOU'RE UP EARLY.

06:52.745 --> 06:54.705
- OH, LORD,
WAIT TILL I TELL YOU.

06:54.789 --> 06:57.166
[rustling]

06:57.250 --> 06:58.876
WHAT'S THAT NOISE?

06:58.960 --> 07:01.921
- OH, I HOPE THERE'S NOT
AN ANIMAL IN THE WALLS.

07:02.004 --> 07:05.675
[rustling]

07:16.227 --> 07:17.353
- [hoarsely]
MORNING.

07:19.230 --> 07:21.524
- ARE YOU OKAY?
- UGH.

07:21.607 --> 07:23.151
THIS SUIT SEEMS
TO BE JUST SUCKING

07:23.234 --> 07:24.861
ALL THE MOISTURE
OUT OF ME.

07:24.944 --> 07:26.654
JUST SO DRY.

07:28.447 --> 07:30.074
SO...
[clears throat]

07:30.158 --> 07:31.534
WHAT'S ALL THIS?

07:31.617 --> 07:33.744
- OH, YOUR
WEDDING ASSIGNMENTS.

07:33.828 --> 07:35.329
FOR THE LAST TWO DAYS,
ELKA'S DONE NOTHING

07:35.413 --> 07:37.081
BUT STUDY MAGAZINES,
AND BOOKS,

07:37.165 --> 07:38.749
AND WATCH CABLE SHOWS--

07:38.833 --> 07:41.711
<i>BRIDEZILLAS, BRIDE WARS,</i>
<i>BRIDALPLASTY</i>

07:41.794 --> 07:43.379
-<i> BRIDALPLASTY?</i>
WHAT'S THAT?

07:43.462 --> 07:44.839
- IT'S THIS RIDICULOUS SHOW

07:44.922 --> 07:46.549
WHERE WOMEN GET PLASTIC SURGERY
BEFORE THEIR WEDDINGS.

07:46.632 --> 07:49.719
- AND? I AM MISSING
THE TWIST.

07:49.802 --> 07:52.722
- LAST NIGHT,
ELKA WOKE ME UP AT 3:00 A.M.

07:52.805 --> 07:55.057
TO ANNOUNCE THAT I
WAS HER WEDDING PLANNER.

07:55.141 --> 07:57.935
AND YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE
THE MOOD SWINGS.

07:58.019 --> 08:00.104
I'M AFRAID WE'VE CREATED
A BIT OF A MONSTER.

08:00.188 --> 08:02.440
- OH, WELL, NOW, YOU AND ELKA
NEVER SEE EYE TO EYE.

08:02.523 --> 08:04.025
I'M SURE SHE'LL BE FINE.

08:15.661 --> 08:17.872
- I GOT A SPRAY TAN.

08:20.499 --> 08:22.251
- YES, WE CAN SEE THAT.

08:22.335 --> 08:24.170
[chuckles]
WHY?

08:24.253 --> 08:26.005
- ALL THE BRIDES DO IT.

08:26.088 --> 08:29.300
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
NOW, BE HONEST.

08:31.344 --> 08:34.096
- WELL--
- YOU DON'T LIKE IT.

08:34.179 --> 08:36.432
MY WEDDING'S RUINED!
- NO, NO, NO, NO.

08:36.515 --> 08:38.601
WE--WE LOVE IT A LOT.

08:38.683 --> 08:42.020
- YOU LOOK VERY TROPICAL.

08:45.024 --> 08:47.401
- OH, NO!

08:47.485 --> 08:50.238
I LOOK LIKE
A [bleep] OOMPA-LOOMPA!

08:52.990 --> 08:54.700
- ELKA!

08:54.784 --> 08:56.452
- DON'T YOU WATCH
BRIDAL SHOWS?

08:56.535 --> 08:59.997
THAT'S HOW WE ALL TALK.

09:00.081 --> 09:02.083
- ALSO, BRIDE HAS REQUESTED

09:02.166 --> 09:04.168
THAT WE DO A CHOREOGRAPHED
AISLE WALK.

09:04.252 --> 09:07.338
- I WANT IT TO GO VIRAL.

09:07.421 --> 09:08.798
- NOW, ELKA--

09:08.881 --> 09:12.510
- GET...IT...DONE.

09:15.596 --> 09:17.932
- SHE'S ALSO BECOME A FAN
OF TURNING EVERYTHING

09:18.015 --> 09:20.142
INTO A STRING
OF ONE-WORD SENTENCES.

09:20.226 --> 09:21.018
- ALL...

09:21.102 --> 09:23.187
BRIDES...

09:23.271 --> 09:24.689
[quickly]
DO IT.

09:29.402 --> 09:31.737
- WELCOME TO <i> BRIDEZELKA.</i>

09:41.038 --> 09:43.165
- CRAP.

09:43.249 --> 09:44.625
CRAP.

09:46.085 --> 09:48.337
CRAP.

09:48.421 --> 09:51.799
I NEED ROSIER ROSES.
WRITE IT DOWN.

09:51.882 --> 09:52.842
- I'LL REMEMBER.

09:52.925 --> 09:55.845
- WRITE...IT...DOWN.

09:55.928 --> 09:57.888
[doorbell rings]

10:01.434 --> 10:05.313
- HELLO, FRED.
- HI.

10:05.396 --> 10:06.480
- HI, GROOM.

10:06.564 --> 10:08.190
- HI, BRIDE!

10:08.274 --> 10:09.442
- YOU'RE LATE.

10:10.776 --> 10:12.236
- I'M SORRY.
I WAS, UH, DELAYED,

10:12.320 --> 10:15.323
ANSWERING QUESTIONS
ABOUT THIS.

10:15.406 --> 10:17.825
DO WE HAVE TO WEAR THIS
ALL THE TIME?

10:17.908 --> 10:20.036
- [crying]
I DIDN'T REALIZE

10:20.119 --> 10:23.372
THAT DOING THE LEAST
LITTLE THING FOR ME

10:23.456 --> 10:26.417
WAS SUCH A CHORE.

10:26.500 --> 10:28.669
- PLEASE DON'T CRY.
I'M HAPPY TO WEAR IT.
