02:21.075 --> 02:22.708
           (knocking)

02:28.115 --> 02:29.515
          Who's there?

02:30.684 --> 02:32.317
     GILES: Me.

02:36.090 --> 02:37.923
         Just a second.

02:42.696 --> 02:44.163
             Argh.

02:54.108 --> 02:57.309
  You got you--
  you got you a girl up in here?

02:57.311 --> 02:59.311
           Wouldn't surprise me.

02:59.313 --> 03:04.783
   You and Brad McCready's widow
   got tongues wagging
   all over town.

03:04.785 --> 03:07.252
         You haven't even set up
         the card table yet.

03:09.290 --> 03:11.557
Uh, no, I meant to cancel.

03:11.559 --> 03:13.692
I'm not up
for poker tonight.

03:13.694 --> 03:16.662
        You haven't missed
        a card game in 15 years.

03:16.664 --> 03:18.463
                What's going on?

03:18.465 --> 03:21.833
I'm just not feeling well.

03:21.835 --> 03:25.037
   Does this have anything to do
   with your side business?

03:25.039 --> 03:27.306
             Something you wanna
             tell me about?

03:29.310 --> 03:30.342
              No.

03:30.344 --> 03:32.344
        (car pulling up)

03:32.346 --> 03:34.379
                 You sure?

03:34.381 --> 03:36.381
                 A lot going on.

03:36.383 --> 03:38.150
      You keeping to yourself...

03:38.152 --> 03:40.586
                 Mildred, Caleb.

03:42.256 --> 03:44.823
Fine. Let's play some cards.

03:54.201 --> 03:57.269
        (muffled voices)

04:02.443 --> 04:04.243
           (laughing)

04:08.882 --> 04:10.882
It's just like a shot,

04:10.884 --> 04:13.752
and it bounces off
his own elbow.

04:23.297 --> 04:26.131
What about you, kid?
You're gonna be in front
of a big crowd tomorrow.

04:26.133 --> 04:27.599
You nervous yet?

04:27.601 --> 04:30.636
        (radio fades in)

04:30.638 --> 04:32.771
             What?

04:32.773 --> 04:35.040
Remembrance Day.

04:35.042 --> 04:36.942
Gonna be a lot
of eyes on you.

04:36.944 --> 04:39.478
   Where's your head tonight?

04:39.480 --> 04:43.115
Been seven years, and we finally
have a fitting memorial
to those men.

04:43.117 --> 04:45.250
Thanks to you.

04:45.252 --> 04:47.319
        You seen it yet?

04:47.321 --> 04:48.887
        OGDEN: Sure did.

04:48.889 --> 04:50.922
       Helped cart it in
       from Pittsburgh.

04:50.924 --> 04:54.593
      Well, that's what you been
      doing on all these trips
      out of town.

04:54.595 --> 04:57.462
      Wouldn't you like to know.

04:57.464 --> 04:59.564
Matter of fact, I would.

04:59.566 --> 05:05.504
You been wearing that
poker face of yours 24/7.

05:05.506 --> 05:08.907
      Why you so damn interested
      in my private life?

05:08.909 --> 05:12.844
     I ask you for an update
     every time you take a dump?

05:12.846 --> 05:14.780
Every time you screw your wife?

05:14.782 --> 05:16.815
       I think we should
       call it a night.

05:17.918 --> 05:20.352
We like to do it
on Wednesdays.

05:20.354 --> 05:22.387
Kind of a tradition.

05:23.824 --> 05:25.624
      Your turn.

05:25.626 --> 05:27.159
          You believe this shit?

05:27.161 --> 05:30.929
Where were you that night that
fire started at Lowell's place?

05:32.433 --> 05:33.999
      You weren't at home,

05:34.001 --> 05:36.368
and you weren't on duty.

05:38.172 --> 05:40.539
      Rosie was over there
      with Kat.

05:40.541 --> 05:42.107
         Maybe I should
         just ask her.

05:42.109 --> 05:43.842
            You don't know shit!

05:43.844 --> 05:45.010
Hey, hey!
     Let's call it a night.

05:45.012 --> 05:46.345
         (shouting)
          Come on, knock it off!

05:46.347 --> 05:47.779
              Ugh.

05:47.781 --> 05:50.182
        For god's sake,
        break it up!

05:50.184 --> 05:51.383
         Man, come on!

05:51.385 --> 05:53.018
    Would you all
    please get the hell out.

05:53.020 --> 05:55.520
           Now. Now.

05:55.522 --> 05:57.456
             Here.

05:58.692 --> 06:00.225
MAYOR:
What you think you
were doing?

06:00.227 --> 06:01.660
You knocked down
the reverend.

06:01.662 --> 06:02.694
           I'm fine.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.996
Fucking shit...
              Come on.

06:04.998 --> 06:08.633
        Bullshit! You don't get
        to tell me what's police
        business and what isn't.

06:08.635 --> 06:10.736
       A man comes into another
       man's house and cuts him

06:10.738 --> 06:12.738
               is assault.
This is different.

06:12.740 --> 06:14.840
Putting him behind bars
is not gonna stop him.

06:14.842 --> 06:17.809
       Hell yeah, it will.
       That's the point of jail.

06:17.811 --> 06:19.578
                What if he hurts
                someone else?

06:19.580 --> 06:23.148
    You gonna sit there, bleed,
    and tell me you're doing
    nothing about this?

06:23.150 --> 06:25.384
This is a sign.
I cannot ignore it.

06:25.386 --> 06:26.752
                        Of what?

06:26.754 --> 06:29.187
If this man is who
he says he is,

06:29.189 --> 06:31.423
then I'll be more effective
than I could ever imagine.

06:31.425 --> 06:33.191
It means he's afraid of me.
That I...

06:33.193 --> 06:34.559
I could hurt him.

06:34.561 --> 06:36.428
                   How, exactly?

06:36.430 --> 06:39.231
By bringing the Lord's power
down to bear on him.

06:40.434 --> 06:42.834
Drag him out of the shadows.

06:42.836 --> 06:45.404
Exposing him
for what he is.

07:35.489 --> 07:36.922
What are you doing up?

07:36.924 --> 07:40.459
It's Remembrance Day.
There's no school.

07:40.461 --> 07:42.394
             I have stuff to do.

07:42.396 --> 07:44.095
                I'll see you
                at the memorial.

07:44.097 --> 07:45.730
Wait a minute, wait.

07:45.732 --> 07:47.098
Wait-- wait a minute, Megan.

07:47.100 --> 07:48.800
         Megan?

07:48.802 --> 07:50.235
                   (door closes)
            (sighs)

07:55.943 --> 07:57.476
          Amber?

07:57.478 --> 07:59.644
                    (scratching)

08:04.618 --> 08:05.984
          Amber?

08:19.466 --> 08:21.066
                     Sweetie?
      (scratching stops)

08:28.041 --> 08:30.509
    Honey, why don't you come
    downstairs and get something
    to eat?

08:31.945 --> 08:34.145
       I don't feel good.

08:34.147 --> 08:36.715
        Well, why don't you come
        lie down, then. You can
        watch a movie.

08:45.626 --> 08:46.691
          (screaming)

09:36.543 --> 09:39.110
      Come on. one drink.

09:39.112 --> 09:40.745
             I don't know, Russ.

09:40.747 --> 09:44.783
        I can't. I told Allison
        I'd be home early.

09:44.785 --> 09:46.351
     Right.

09:46.353 --> 09:48.086
Gonna make babies.

09:48.088 --> 09:51.022
           Don't do that. It's--

09:51.024 --> 09:53.892
 all the pressure's taking
 the damn fun out of the thing.

09:53.894 --> 09:56.261
Megan getting pregnant
didn't help either.

09:56.263 --> 09:58.296
Tell me you think
this is strange.

09:58.298 --> 10:02.133
Megan wants me and Allison
there in the delivery room.

10:02.135 --> 10:04.803
Like, while it's happening.

10:04.805 --> 10:06.037
       Oh, I could take a shift.

10:06.039 --> 10:07.472
                 You just let me
                 know what day.

10:07.474 --> 10:08.974
Nah, that's all right,
you don't--

10:08.976 --> 10:10.542
               No, no, I insist.

10:10.544 --> 10:13.078
        I wouldn't want you
        to miss that, mmm-mmm...

10:13.080 --> 10:14.446
           uncomfortable moment.

10:14.448 --> 10:16.014
      Fucker.
                      (chuckles)

10:18.051 --> 10:19.150
      All right.

10:20.387 --> 10:21.987
         (sizzles)
                (grunts)

10:21.989 --> 10:23.288
        You all right?

10:24.791 --> 10:28.827
 Yeah, I-- I just burned my hand
 on a Harley exhaust.

10:28.829 --> 10:29.928
           (chuckles)

10:29.930 --> 10:31.396
                  Dumbass.

10:32.733 --> 10:35.500
Hey, Russ, thanks.

10:35.502 --> 10:37.002
                       You bet.

10:53.520 --> 10:54.886
            GILES: Good morning!

10:57.758 --> 10:59.190
    Morning.

10:59.192 --> 11:02.427
           I remember
           when your grandfather
           owned this property.

11:02.429 --> 11:05.830
      Used to be
      a horse stable over there

11:05.832 --> 11:08.199
          before it burned down.

11:08.201 --> 11:11.169
     Break his heart to see
     what happened to the place.

11:11.171 --> 11:13.672
Yeah. I'll have to take
your word for that.

11:13.674 --> 11:15.440
          Why did you come back?

11:17.144 --> 11:18.677
You wanna see
the restraining order?

11:18.679 --> 11:20.645
    No, I know why
    you're not with your family.

11:20.647 --> 11:22.714
               Why are you here?

11:22.716 --> 11:24.716
   You could have gone anywhere.

11:24.718 --> 11:26.584
             Made a fresh start.

11:27.554 --> 11:29.721
            Put all this behind.

11:33.894 --> 11:35.894
House is already paid for.

11:36.963 --> 11:38.730
             I gotta go to work.

11:38.732 --> 11:41.700
I think you know what's
going on around here.

11:41.702 --> 11:46.237
Mildred Robson walking around
with something inside of her.

11:48.141 --> 11:49.174
             Yeah.

11:49.176 --> 11:52.177
Hospital report
says "inconclusive."

11:52.179 --> 11:54.813
They don't know why she died.

11:54.815 --> 11:57.315
Just that
she stopped breathing.

11:57.317 --> 12:00.552
  I told you,
  I got nothing to do with that.

12:02.389 --> 12:04.856
And I believe you.

12:04.858 --> 12:07.792
      Come on, son.
      Take a ride with me.

12:13.700 --> 12:15.266
                 Get in the car!

12:15.268 --> 12:16.434
               Lord, have mercy.

12:16.436 --> 12:20.905
        How can we take a ride
        with you not in the car?

12:20.907 --> 12:22.841
¶ Just a mile ¶
                 ¶ Just a mile ¶

12:22.843 --> 12:24.843
¶ Down the road ¶
               ¶ Down the road ¶

12:24.845 --> 12:29.114
  ¶ And a street or two away ¶

12:29.116 --> 12:31.950
¶ Lives that freckled misses ¶

12:31.952 --> 12:34.619
¶ That I want most every day ¶

12:38.358 --> 12:40.692
¶ To the home ¶
                 ¶ To the home ¶

12:40.694 --> 12:43.094
¶ Of her father ¶
               ¶ Of her father ¶

12:43.096 --> 12:48.266
...then after
Zoe Trumble's poem
I'll call you up.

12:48.268 --> 12:50.602
You do your usual...

12:50.604 --> 12:52.937
prayer, benediction, thing.

12:52.939 --> 12:55.874
Then you'll present
the memorial.

12:57.444 --> 13:00.211
         Huh? That's...

13:00.213 --> 13:03.281
      God bless all of us
      and the USA,

13:03.283 --> 13:05.617
     and that's it.

13:05.619 --> 13:07.819
            Then everybody eats.

13:07.821 --> 13:10.655
That's right. Gordon Shipley's
doing the barbecue this year,

13:10.657 --> 13:13.258
and the Hetzel sisters
are donating pies.

13:13.260 --> 13:16.227
   Wonder if they have free pies
   on the streets of Sodom.

13:19.065 --> 13:22.767
It's a celebration of life
for those left behind.

13:22.769 --> 13:25.270
    It brings
    the community together.

13:25.272 --> 13:27.205
                'Course it does.

13:30.443 --> 13:32.644
You know, we went
pretty late last night.

13:34.014 --> 13:36.114
Get some rest.

13:36.116 --> 13:38.750
Lie down
for a couple hours.

14:05.712 --> 14:08.446
Is this supposed
to mean something?

14:08.448 --> 14:10.348
          You tell me.

14:10.350 --> 14:14.252
   Reverend says you have
   a sense for these things.

14:19.459 --> 14:23.394
   You picking up any kind of...
   reading on all this?

14:24.731 --> 14:26.197
      Reading?

14:26.199 --> 14:27.732
I'm not a psychic.

14:27.734 --> 14:30.168
   But you can tell if, uh...

14:30.170 --> 14:32.804
someone's like Mildred Robson.

14:32.806 --> 14:36.507
 Passing for a human with one
 of them things inside of 'em.

14:36.509 --> 14:38.376
        You're looking
        to test someone.

14:40.080 --> 14:42.380
          Who?
                 Does it matter?

14:45.919 --> 14:49.721
Um... I gotta
get close to 'em.

14:49.723 --> 14:52.490
Sometimes they have
a reaction to me.

14:54.261 --> 14:57.495
Um, especially if I touch them.

14:57.497 --> 14:59.998
            But you can fix 'em?

15:00.000 --> 15:01.566
                 Get 'em out?

15:03.403 --> 15:05.270
        Sometimes.

15:05.272 --> 15:06.571
                  Sometimes?

15:06.573 --> 15:08.373
Look, what do you want?

15:08.375 --> 15:09.674
         I don't know
         how it works.

15:09.676 --> 15:12.110
 Sometimes when we get it out,
 they're fine,

15:12.112 --> 15:13.811
and then sometimes it's...

15:15.048 --> 15:16.247
          like my mom.

15:18.618 --> 15:20.985
                     Look, Kyle.

15:23.290 --> 15:25.356
              Lot of people
              are afraid of you.

15:25.358 --> 15:28.259
           They think you should
           be run out of town.

15:28.261 --> 15:32.363
   But I think
   it's a good sign you're here.

15:32.365 --> 15:35.566
            You didn't come back
            for the free rent.

15:35.568 --> 15:37.902
    You got unfinished business.

15:37.904 --> 15:40.605
        A stain you want
        to wipe off of yourself.

15:43.944 --> 15:45.310
       I don't know.

15:45.312 --> 15:47.478
       Bullshit, you don't know.

15:50.383 --> 15:52.650
             That says something
             about who you are.

15:52.652 --> 15:54.218
                    Truly.

15:55.422 --> 15:57.488
                 Whether you
                 know it or not.

15:58.758 --> 16:02.393
           And I think there's
           a stain on this town.

16:03.496 --> 16:05.396
         And it's getting worse.

                       Patricia.

16:29.155 --> 16:32.991
      My prayers are with your
      husband and all those fine
      men we lost that day.

16:32.993 --> 16:35.126
Thank you, Reverend.

16:35.128 --> 16:36.594
                     Wait.

16:39.032 --> 16:44.168
I want to thank you for
your prayers in my dark hour.

16:44.170 --> 16:46.371
That night with Caleb.

16:46.373 --> 16:48.539
               I didn't do much.
No, you were there.

16:48.541 --> 16:50.875
And you were brave,
and I was a jackass.

16:52.979 --> 16:55.780
             Go on.

16:55.782 --> 17:01.052
You reminded me that this thing
is bigger than one man
and his bruised ego.

17:01.054 --> 17:03.354
It's about being selfless,

17:03.356 --> 17:06.924
and you're about
the most selfless person
I think I've ever met.

17:10.163 --> 17:11.596
              People will see.

17:12.665 --> 17:14.965
I don't care
if the whole town sees.

17:19.005 --> 17:20.972
            I, uh...

17:20.973 --> 17:23.340
I have something
I need to attend to.

17:23.343 --> 17:25.542
I'll see you
at the ceremony.
                      All right.

17:25.545 --> 17:26.978
All right.

17:43.196 --> 17:45.797
Take a pew, Reverend.
You're up next.

17:56.709 --> 17:59.110
I'm surprised to see you
up and about

17:59.112 --> 18:01.612
after last night.

18:01.614 --> 18:05.917
    Oh, you already heard about
    the Reverend's legendary
    poker game.

18:05.919 --> 18:07.552
    Sun come up on this one?

18:07.554 --> 18:09.620
           No, not this time.

18:12.292 --> 18:15.426
   I need to be ready and rested
   for this day of remembrance.

18:16.596 --> 18:19.630
             It's my job to show
             the community

18:19.632 --> 18:22.767
  how to stand tall and defiant

18:22.769 --> 18:24.635
        in the face of darkness.

18:25.972 --> 18:29.240
Well, that's admirable,

18:29.242 --> 18:34.145
but I thought the point
of remembering tragedies
of your past...

18:34.147 --> 18:37.148
making sure
you don't repeat yourself.

18:39.552 --> 18:41.919
             You a poker player?

18:41.921 --> 18:44.455
     Never miss my regular game.

18:44.457 --> 18:46.791
                 No matter what.

18:46.793 --> 18:48.926
    Last night was no exception.

18:48.928 --> 18:53.231
Here I thought
gambling was a sin.

18:53.233 --> 18:55.800
Aren't you afraid
of the consequences?

18:55.802 --> 18:57.969
          BARBER:
          Reverend don't
          sweat the small stuff.

18:57.971 --> 19:00.138
               No, that's right.

19:00.140 --> 19:05.009
 What's a friendly game of cards
 when your day job is facing
 the prince of darkness?

19:05.011 --> 19:08.412
           Helps keep everything
           in perspective.

19:08.414 --> 19:12.483
    Now, I'd be happy to make
    a seat at the table for you.

19:12.485 --> 19:16.387
     Nothing exposes a man's
     true nature like a good ol'
     game of poker.

19:21.794 --> 19:22.860

20:23.089 --> 20:26.224
Can I have
a peanut butter sandwich?

20:26.226 --> 20:29.026
               Sure. With honey?

20:29.028 --> 20:30.428
        Yes, please.

20:41.507 --> 20:43.074
Are you feeling better?

20:55.388 --> 20:58.089
   Hon, is that a picture of us?

20:58.091 --> 20:59.857
           You and me and Daddy?

21:01.027 --> 21:02.593
      Uh-huh.

21:02.595 --> 21:05.730
 Well, Daddy's all done and you,
 but you didn't finish me.

21:05.732 --> 21:07.098
          Nope.

21:09.702 --> 21:11.535
            Well, I could
            go get your pencils,

21:11.537 --> 21:14.005
       and after lunch you could
       finish the drawing.

21:17.744 --> 21:20.378
I don't know
which face to draw.

22:08.628 --> 22:10.961
      Take care.

22:10.963 --> 22:12.763
Happy Remembrance Day.

22:16.035 --> 22:18.102
Your daddy was
such a good man.

22:34.120 --> 22:37.221
Imagine this day has a special
meaning for you, Barnes.

22:37.223 --> 22:39.890
Considering there ought
to be a lump of coal
with your name on it, too.

22:41.994 --> 22:44.695
Would have saved your wife
a lot of heartache if it was.

22:48.534 --> 22:50.067
Happy Remembrance Day.

23:30.676 --> 23:35.846
Huh. You showed up
right on time.

23:35.848 --> 23:39.450
I got physical therapy
in about ten minutes.

23:39.452 --> 23:41.952
You can wheel me up there.

23:43.389 --> 23:46.190

What the hell is this?

24:11.717 --> 24:13.984
   You asked what I had to give,

24:13.986 --> 24:15.419
                      that's it.

24:15.421 --> 24:18.055
     I emptied my bank accounts.
     I pawned my wedding ring,

24:18.057 --> 24:20.124
          every cent I had
          in the couch cushions.

taking this seriously?

24:28.334 --> 24:29.900
      This is my husband's life.

    seriously I take this.

24:33.306 --> 24:36.106
           That's all I can get.

24:36.108 --> 24:39.109
 That's my daughter's new shoes,

24:39.111 --> 24:41.645

27:15.001 --> 27:18.135
There's people here today
that don't respect this badge

27:18.137 --> 27:20.638

27:22.074 --> 27:23.741

look a little too hard
like I still got something
to prove.

27:35.788 --> 27:37.655
                    That's fair.

27:37.657 --> 27:41.692
        I also know you got
        this job by knowing when
        to look the other way.

28:23.803 --> 28:27.037
   If we're not ever mindful,

28:27.039 --> 28:29.339
      we lose the lessons
      of our past,

  become something permanent,

28:33.312 --> 28:36.647
     something that we can
     see and touch.

28:36.649 --> 28:39.049
   Symbols of what
   we can feel in our hearts.

28:39.051 --> 28:42.986

28:42.988 --> 28:45.089

A man whose faith and devotion
saw us through our darkest hour.

    The pastor of the Light

28:52.531 --> 28:54.531

     We wanna say...
     it's the will of God,

  we were the ones

      and a wicked blade.

31:28.821 --> 31:31.121
   A warning that as we sow...

31:33.092 --> 31:35.158
       so shall we reap.

31:43.369 --> 31:45.335
Thank you, Reverend.

31:45.337 --> 31:47.170
     (smattering applause)

31:49.875 --> 31:52.976
    MAYOR:
    I think we've all been
    in suspense long enough.

31:54.680 --> 31:57.114
      I now give you
      our enduring tribute

31:57.116 --> 32:00.150
       to the men of Rome
       who fell that day.

32:01.086 --> 32:03.720
      May God bless them,

32:03.722 --> 32:07.391
      and may they always
      live in our hearts.

32:07.393 --> 32:08.759
             Okay.

32:17.202 --> 32:19.536
                  Cover it up.

32:19.538 --> 32:21.471
                   No. No.
       Cover it up.

32:21.473 --> 32:23.607
                     No!
Reverend, let them
put it back on.

32:23.609 --> 32:25.275
       This is what
       I'm talking about!

32:25.277 --> 32:27.978
  This is what
  I'm talking about! His sign!

32:27.980 --> 32:33.517
    For he walks amongst us.
    Right here, right now!

32:34.720 --> 32:36.787
   The same way
   that he did at that mine.

32:36.789 --> 32:38.155
Reverend, please.

32:38.157 --> 32:39.456
                   No.
         Reverend--

32:39.458 --> 32:42.893
     You don't believe me?
     I've seen it.

32:42.895 --> 32:45.796
    A boy's body floating...

32:45.798 --> 32:48.298
      hovering in the air.

32:50.235 --> 32:52.102
     And then these demons,

32:52.104 --> 32:54.171
  they come out of your mouth

32:54.173 --> 32:56.506
      like a black cloud.

32:56.508 --> 33:01.244
    And then they reach out,
    and they grab you! Okay?

33:02.948 --> 33:06.616
   But we can send 'em back.
   I can send 'em back.

33:06.618 --> 33:09.419
    Back to their master.
    We can send him back too.

33:09.421 --> 33:12.122
 But only if we recognize him.

33:12.124 --> 33:15.359
    Only if we recognize him
    and call his name.

33:21.700 --> 33:23.100
                    Look at him.

33:23.102 --> 33:26.269
       Look, all of you!

33:27.806 --> 33:29.473
          Look at him!

33:29.475 --> 33:31.141
              <i> ¶ ¶</i>

33:31.143 --> 33:33.110
    See him for what he is!

33:34.313 --> 33:39.483
                 For that man--
                 that man...

33:39.485 --> 33:41.351
        he is the devil!

33:41.353 --> 33:43.453
       Reverend.
              No!

33:43.455 --> 33:46.456
     He's the devil!
     That man is the devil!

33:46.458 --> 33:47.924
     And he made his mark!

33:49.795 --> 33:50.994
            (gasps)

33:54.400 --> 33:56.233
       He did this to me!

33:56.235 --> 33:57.868
           Rev.

33:57.870 --> 33:59.536
He did this to me!

33:59.538 --> 34:01.571
Hey.
              He did this to me!

34:03.342 --> 34:05.175
       He did this to me!
                      Hey.

34:05.177 --> 34:06.410
                    Hey!

34:06.412 --> 34:07.878
          We gotta go.

34:07.880 --> 34:09.612
              He did this to me.

34:50.922 --> 34:52.188
 Rev.

35:11.710 --> 35:13.043
                    Thank you.

35:13.045 --> 35:14.411
           Yeah.

35:14.413 --> 35:16.613
    You get some rest, huh?

35:16.615 --> 35:18.615
    See a doctor about that.

35:20.285 --> 35:22.452
What, about this?

35:22.454 --> 35:23.820
     Or this?

35:26.058 --> 35:27.357
           Whichever.

35:29.661 --> 35:31.061
You believe me?

35:32.231 --> 35:33.497
                   I don't know.

35:33.499 --> 35:35.599
               Maybe the devil
               was in that mine.

35:35.601 --> 35:38.802
  But what does that matter now?

35:38.804 --> 35:42.005
We've gotta focus on what's
going on in this town right now.

35:42.007 --> 35:44.975
  I believe Sidney's one of 'em,
  and he's not alone.

35:44.977 --> 35:47.644
        I mean,
        I'm with you, Rev. I am,

35:47.646 --> 35:50.614
            but we gotta
            be smart about this.

35:50.616 --> 35:51.982
         And tonight...

35:54.286 --> 35:57.754
          Tonight was not smart.

36:16.875 --> 36:18.708
    (knocks)
    Chief?

36:18.710 --> 36:20.110
                Come on in.

36:21.313 --> 36:23.180
        Close that door.

36:28.320 --> 36:30.453
     Have a seat.

36:33.358 --> 36:34.991
 Hell of a Remembrance Day, huh?

36:34.993 --> 36:37.294
Your family still with you?

36:37.296 --> 36:40.597
      No, Megan took Holly home.

36:41.700 --> 36:43.133
            (sighs)

36:43.135 --> 36:46.536
I got a phone call tonight.

36:46.538 --> 36:48.939
From a lawyer.

37:28.780 --> 37:29.846
       Daddy!

37:31.116 --> 37:33.950
            Hey, little firefly.

37:33.952 --> 37:35.986
                  How you doing?
             Good.

37:49.768 --> 37:53.136
Holly finally fell asleep.

37:53.138 --> 37:55.272
She's gonna have
nightmares for months

37:55.274 --> 37:57.507
'cause of that
lunatic Anderson.

38:02.748 --> 38:05.649
Did you and Giles finally
get everybody calmed down?

38:09.554 --> 38:10.987
Mark?

38:14.226 --> 38:16.059
      Giles suspended me.

38:16.061 --> 38:17.294
What?

38:18.297 --> 38:19.529
Why?

38:22.634 --> 38:24.934
        It's all subject
        to a lot of...

38:24.936 --> 38:26.503
    legal, procedural stuff,

38:26.505 --> 38:28.238
    but it boils down to...

38:29.174 --> 38:31.341
    excessive use of force.

38:33.111 --> 38:35.412
     Against Donnie Hamel.

38:44.289 --> 38:45.989
                Did you hear me?

38:48.694 --> 38:51.795
                He's filing
                assault charges.

38:51.797 --> 38:54.264
          Giles said he heard
          from his lawyer today.

39:08.180 --> 39:10.447
             Afraid he's got
             a pretty good case.

39:12.684 --> 39:15.585
This is never gonna end.

39:16.722 --> 39:18.388
                      What?

39:18.390 --> 39:19.456
              Aah!

39:23.528 --> 39:25.695
Where'd you find
that old thing?

39:25.697 --> 39:27.197
                In the basement.

39:27.199 --> 39:28.231
        Yeah?

39:28.233 --> 39:29.933
              It kept you
              from getting hurt.

39:31.303 --> 39:33.203
Yeah.

39:33.205 --> 39:35.372
That it did.

39:36.875 --> 39:38.775
          But other people died.

39:39.745 --> 39:42.245
          Didn't they have them?

39:42.247 --> 39:44.013
Yeah, they did.

39:44.015 --> 39:45.682
They had their own,

39:45.684 --> 39:47.884
but this wasn't
enough that day.

39:49.087 --> 39:51.388
That's why I quit
working there, you know.

39:54.326 --> 39:57.594
          And your mom and I
          felt like...

39:57.596 --> 39:59.662
       there was a reason
       I'd been saved.

39:59.664 --> 40:01.431
You know what
that reason was?

40:04.002 --> 40:05.802
To have you.

40:09.841 --> 40:12.108
We're always gonna
be here for you.

40:17.883 --> 40:20.016
                    I don't want
                    her to stay.

40:28.794 --> 40:31.161
Amber, you gotta
understand that...

40:32.898 --> 40:35.265
that when your mom--

40:35.267 --> 40:38.201
that day--
that was something else,

40:38.203 --> 40:40.670
something inside of her
that made her do what she did.

40:43.809 --> 40:45.442
                         I know.

40:45.444 --> 40:46.609
                       I saw it.

40:46.611 --> 40:47.710
              <i> ¶ ¶</i>

40:47.712 --> 40:48.978
       You--

40:48.980 --> 40:50.547
                   It was black

40:50.549 --> 40:52.148
                and it was cold.

40:57.456 --> 41:00.256
But-- but you saw it go away?

41:00.258 --> 41:01.758
Right? You saw it leave?

41:01.760 --> 41:03.126
Did it leave?

41:10.302 --> 41:12.902
Did it come after you?
Did it hurt you at all?

41:12.904 --> 41:14.137
                     No.

41:19.478 --> 41:21.711
One day this is all
gonna fade away.

41:23.748 --> 41:25.381
Just like a bad dream.

41:27.452 --> 41:29.919
But until that day comes,
I'm gonna protect you.

41:37.429 --> 41:39.963
Better than
one of these ever could.

41:39.965 --> 41:42.332
        You gave him everything?
I didn't give him your badge.

41:42.334 --> 41:44.000
You lost that on your own.
             Oh, Jesus, come on.

41:44.002 --> 41:46.336
Did it feel good, Mark?

41:46.338 --> 41:47.871
Doing what you did to him?

41:47.873 --> 41:49.038
        Yeah, fuck yeah, it did.

41:49.040 --> 41:50.974
    Were you trying to kill him?

41:50.976 --> 41:54.043
       Did you think he was dead
       when you left him lying
       on the side of the road?

41:54.045 --> 41:56.379
               I never asked you
               to protect me.

41:56.381 --> 41:57.514
          No, that's Kyle's job.

41:57.516 --> 41:59.115
Oh, go to hell.

41:59.117 --> 42:00.783
              You never asked me
              for anything.

42:00.785 --> 42:02.619
   I--
                      Megan.

42:02.621 --> 42:04.687
      You never let me in
      in nine years of marriage.

42:04.689 --> 42:06.389
What do you wanna know?

42:06.391 --> 42:08.725
      When he came to the table,
      why you didn't tell me
      it was him?

42:08.727 --> 42:10.960
Because I knew you'd
do something like this.
                   Oh, bullshit.

42:10.962 --> 42:14.364
   You didn't tell me, because
   you didn't want to let me in.

42:14.366 --> 42:16.533
        You didn't want to share
        with me your secret.

42:16.535 --> 42:18.868
Don't-- don't you
put this on me.

42:18.870 --> 42:20.570
       Well, you carry
       this thing around like--

42:20.572 --> 42:22.872
      like it's something
      you don't ever want
      to let go of.

42:22.874 --> 42:24.674
       I mean, it's like
       a rotten tooth

42:24.676 --> 42:27.076
  that you don't want to pull,
  'cause you like the pain.

42:28.847 --> 42:30.747
          He raped me!

42:54.406 --> 42:56.072
                      I'm sorry.

42:59.911 --> 43:02.545
How are we gonna fix this?

43:02.547 --> 43:05.348
           I don't know we can.
