06:01.195 --> 06:03.145
Thanks, Kathy.

06:03.147 --> 06:07.616
- Are council meetings all this boring?
- Most.

06:07.618 --> 06:11.153
- That's, um, Mr. Oxman?
- Harry. Over there.

06:11.155 --> 06:13.322
- You didn't meet him yet?
- No, not yet.

06:13.324 --> 06:16.625
I heard about the job
from Father Duffell at St. Peter's.

06:16.627 --> 06:18.544
<i>Mr. Oxman's</i>
<i>a Democrat, right?</i>

06:18.546 --> 06:20.880
In Yonkers,
parties don't matter.

06:20.882 --> 06:23.165
Whoever controls
the majority of the council

06:23.167 --> 06:24.834
controls the city.

06:24.836 --> 06:27.670
Angelo Martinelli,
the mayor, he's Republican.

06:27.672 --> 06:29.004
<i>He's been around</i>
<i>forever.</i>

06:29.006 --> 06:31.056
Has most of the council
voting with him.

06:31.058 --> 06:33.759
The Republicans were really pissed
at Martinelli,

06:33.761 --> 06:36.512
especially Nick Longo
right there.

06:36.514 --> 06:38.931
<i>...Rules Committee
and adopt the measure...</i>

06:38.933 --> 06:41.851
- Hey, how are you?
- Good. How are you?

06:41.853 --> 06:44.737
<i>- Thank you, Councilwoman Restiano.</i>
- Nick Wasicsko--

06:44.739 --> 06:47.022
he was a county cop
who ran in the 7th Ward.

06:47.024 --> 06:49.358
First-timer.

06:49.360 --> 06:52.244
If your mother needs a handicap
space, you just let me know,

06:52.246 --> 06:54.780
'cause I got these parking people
on the speed dial, all right?

06:54.782 --> 06:57.082
- Lives with his mother.
<i>- Is Mr. Wasicsko here?</i>

06:59.504 --> 07:02.705
- Councilman Wasicsko.
- Right here, Mr. Mayor.

07:02.707 --> 07:04.540
- Just give me a call.
- I will. Thank you.

07:04.542 --> 07:06.709
Yeah. Sorry.

07:06.711 --> 07:08.260
One second.

07:10.681 --> 07:11.714
Sorry, sorry.

07:11.716 --> 07:13.465
Mr. Mayor,
Resolution 143

07:13.467 --> 07:17.720
deals with traffic safety
along Yonkers Avenue between...

07:19.473 --> 07:22.641
<i>I want to get one more
good look at the projects.</i>

07:22.643 --> 07:25.277
<i>- Which ones?</i>
- Schlobohm.

07:25.279 --> 07:26.896
<i>- Those?</i>
<i>- Yeah, right there.</i>

07:26.898 --> 07:28.981
<i>Right downtown.</i>
<i>There you go.</i>

07:42.463 --> 07:45.414
Come, Felipe.

07:45.416 --> 07:50.169
You can watch some TV now
and then you clean your room.

07:51.589 --> 07:54.823
All right,
but you have to do your tasks.

07:58.229 --> 08:00.596
- Yeah.
- See, I told you!

08:00.598 --> 08:02.348
What the fuck
is that, nigga?

08:02.350 --> 08:04.099
Go ahead, motherfucker.
That's it, man.

08:04.101 --> 08:06.485
Go ahead.
See, I told you, B.

08:09.323 --> 08:11.273
<i>Nah, shit, boy!</i>

08:11.275 --> 08:13.409
<i>I told you.</i>
<i>I told you.</i>

08:27.208 --> 08:28.791
<i>No, but you changed it.</i>

08:28.793 --> 08:32.344
No! But I want
to turn on the TV.

08:32.346 --> 08:34.880
- But you changed the channel yesterday.
- No.

08:40.804 --> 08:43.105
- Guys, please.
- I hate this show.

08:43.107 --> 08:47.142
- Mommy?
- <i> But why wait? I want fun now.</i>

08:47.144 --> 08:48.978
<i>First, the car colors</i>
<i>need a tune-up...</i>

08:48.980 --> 08:51.063
All I'm saying is it
would be a good thing

08:51.065 --> 08:53.315
if you and Tasha
could get out of Schlobohm.

08:53.317 --> 08:55.234
And this place ain't
gonna get no better.

08:55.236 --> 08:59.371
You want
Lorna Doones or...

08:59.373 --> 09:02.541
- Nilla Wafers?
- I'm serious, Ma.

09:02.543 --> 09:05.327
Now, there are other places
besides Schlobohm for black folk.

09:05.329 --> 09:08.747
You think School Street
Projects gonna be any better?

09:08.749 --> 09:11.550
- Or Mulford?
- <i> An apartment, Ma.</i>

09:11.552 --> 09:14.303
Now, I can help you
with the rent.

09:14.305 --> 09:15.638
Like you like it.

09:15.640 --> 09:17.973
I came here to visit,
not to have my mama

09:17.975 --> 09:20.342
pack me a bag lunch
like a schoolboy.

09:20.344 --> 09:22.645
Go build
some nice cars today.

09:22.647 --> 09:23.762
Minivans, Ma.

09:23.764 --> 09:26.899
We build minivans up in Tarrytown.
I told you.

09:26.901 --> 09:28.067
Good ones.

09:28.069 --> 09:30.486
Y'all build
the best little vans

09:30.488 --> 09:32.688
money can buy,
I'm sure.

09:32.690 --> 09:34.657
Come here.

09:37.244 --> 09:39.445
- Love you, Ma.
- <i> Mm-hmm.</i>

09:52.176 --> 09:56.345
You want a moment for yourself,
don't you, Nicky?

09:56.347 --> 09:58.380
Not really.

09:58.382 --> 10:00.265
I can tell.

10:00.267 --> 10:03.218
Go on,
talk to him.

10:10.361 --> 10:12.027
All right.

10:16.067 --> 10:18.233
So, uh...

10:18.235 --> 10:19.985
what's new with you?

10:22.623 --> 10:24.656
Uh, me?

10:24.658 --> 10:26.658
You know,
same old bullshit.

10:26.660 --> 10:30.462
Traded a vote with Oxman
on a parking ordinance.

10:30.464 --> 10:33.882
I, um-- I got a bill in
with Martinelli

10:33.884 --> 10:35.884
to name
the senior center.

10:37.805 --> 10:39.722
Housing resolution's
coming up again.

10:39.724 --> 10:41.974
That should be
shit in a bag.

10:44.428 --> 10:46.395
But nothing's easy,
you know?

10:46.397 --> 10:48.564
We all got problems.

10:49.517 --> 10:51.934
Except you.
Right, Pop?

11:07.368 --> 11:08.617
- Hey, Tommy.
- Councilman.

11:08.619 --> 11:10.619
Hey, you coming to kiss the ring?
For what, gold shield?

11:10.621 --> 11:12.838
Nah. Council agenda
for Tuesday.

11:12.840 --> 11:15.257
How else would you guys know how
to vote if Ralph don't tell ya?

11:18.963 --> 11:21.180
Hey, Joni.
Mr. Arred should be expecting me.

11:21.182 --> 11:24.266
- I'll let him know you're here.
- All right, thanks.

11:24.268 --> 11:28.103
Hey, young Charlie Cola,
as I live and breathe.

11:28.105 --> 11:31.140
I just left your dad
over at the hall.

11:31.142 --> 11:33.942
- You up here for what?
- Nothing, really.

11:33.944 --> 11:35.644
<i>Councilman Wasicsko is here.</i>

11:35.646 --> 11:37.229
Okay, well,
good luck with that.

11:37.231 --> 11:39.281
Mr. Arred's ready for you.

11:39.283 --> 11:41.533
Oh, all right.

11:46.991 --> 11:51.827
I don't know.
I don't see it, Ralph.

11:51.829 --> 11:54.329
Martinelli's been in there
for six terms.

11:54.331 --> 11:57.633
- Enough is enough, maybe.
- The guy owns a printing company.

11:57.635 --> 12:00.169
He can paper the city
with campaign literature

12:00.171 --> 12:01.753
a dozen times over.

12:01.755 --> 12:04.056
Look, I'm not gonna
bullshit you.

12:04.058 --> 12:07.426
Angelo's strong.
But who knows?

12:07.428 --> 12:10.179
Right guy
at the right time?

12:10.181 --> 12:12.264
You got two years
on the council

12:12.266 --> 12:14.016
and no enemies so far.

12:14.018 --> 12:15.400
How old are you?

12:15.402 --> 12:17.269
I'll be 28 in May.

12:17.271 --> 12:18.904
Christ.

12:18.906 --> 12:21.523
You got plenty of time,
even if it doesn't work this run.

12:21.525 --> 12:24.943
I'm-- I'm really
not seeing it, Ralph.

12:24.945 --> 12:26.912
Why? Why run me
for mayor?

12:26.914 --> 12:29.531
Nick, look,
this redistricting,

12:29.533 --> 12:32.117
I got two Democrats,
two good votes--

12:32.119 --> 12:33.452
you and Frank McGovern--

12:33.454 --> 12:35.337
who are gonna be
primarying each other.

12:35.339 --> 12:36.922
Yeah, okay, well,
then run McGovern for mayor

12:36.924 --> 12:38.373
and let me hold down
my council seat

12:38.375 --> 12:40.292
and, you know, you run
Frank against Martinelli.

12:40.294 --> 12:42.177
I don't see Frank
that way.

12:43.347 --> 12:45.214
Look, I'll raise you
some money, Nick.

12:45.216 --> 12:48.350
Enough to make a respectable run--
say, 40 grand.

12:48.352 --> 12:51.220
<i>I'm not gonna throw you</i>
<i>to the wolves here, Nick.</i>

12:51.222 --> 12:53.939
You got a real shot
at this, maybe.

13:02.032 --> 13:04.900
<i>- Councilman Mangieri.</i>
<i>- Here.</i>

13:04.902 --> 13:07.736
- <i> Councilwoman McKirgan.</i>
- <i> Here.</i>

13:07.738 --> 13:09.955
Not so boring
tonight, huh?

13:09.957 --> 13:12.374
<i>- Councilman Fay.</i>
<i>- Here.</i>

13:12.376 --> 13:15.210
- Councilwoman Restiano.
- Here.

13:15.212 --> 13:18.213
Councilman Spallone.

13:18.215 --> 13:21.300
I was there, Bobby.
You don't think I wasn't there?

13:21.302 --> 13:23.752
I watched the Bronx die
from what this idiot judge

13:23.754 --> 13:25.254
is trying to shove
down our throats.

13:25.256 --> 13:28.090
- Councilman Spallone!
- Yeah, yeah. I'm here.

13:31.762 --> 13:34.096
<i>All present, Mr. Mayor.</i>

13:37.768 --> 13:39.401
First item, then.

13:39.403 --> 13:41.570
Resolution number 69,

13:41.572 --> 13:45.107
Mayor Martinelli
and Vice Mayor Oxman sponsoring.

13:45.109 --> 13:46.992
In the matter
of court-ordered housing

13:46.994 --> 13:50.913
<i>in the case of the United
States and the NAACP</i>

13:50.915 --> 13:52.915
<i>versus City of Yonkers.</i>

13:56.453 --> 13:58.587
Is there
any discussion?

13:58.589 --> 14:02.040
Yeah, there's something
I'd like to discuss, Mr. Mayor.

14:02.042 --> 14:05.127
<i>I'd like to discuss the
fact that what this judge is doing</i>

14:05.129 --> 14:07.930
is nothing short
of social engineering

14:07.932 --> 14:10.632
by someone-- by someone
who doesn't live

14:10.634 --> 14:12.467
anywhere near
our neighborhood.

14:12.469 --> 14:15.137
The fact is is that we lost that lawsuit.

14:15.139 --> 14:17.389
The decision before
us tonight is clear.

14:17.391 --> 14:18.974
<i>The choice is</i>
<i>to be responsible</i>

14:18.976 --> 14:20.892
to the people
who elected us.

14:20.894 --> 14:23.312
Well, I, for one, am not
going to be intimidated

14:23.314 --> 14:25.564
by this judge
on what I believe in.

14:25.566 --> 14:28.283
We can't become a city that is both...

14:28.285 --> 14:30.652
in contempt and bankrupt.

14:30.654 --> 14:33.538
The issue is
that someone

14:33.540 --> 14:35.240
is gonna put together
a housing plan.

14:35.242 --> 14:37.159
Do you want to have a say in it?

14:37.161 --> 14:39.328
Do we want to make sure that
the plan is a moderate one?

14:39.330 --> 14:41.630
'Cause that is the only issue now--

14:41.632 --> 14:43.882
Let him finish.

14:47.504 --> 14:49.972
That's it.
We are no longer allowing signs

14:49.974 --> 14:51.556
- in the council chamber.
- You.

14:54.762 --> 14:56.561
<i>Anybody who
is carrying a sign</i>

14:56.563 --> 14:58.847
<i>shall relinquish it</i>
<i>or be removed.</i>

14:58.849 --> 15:03.435
<i>And anyone involved in</i>
<i>any more outbursts</i>

15:03.437 --> 15:05.687
will be removed
as well!

15:05.689 --> 15:07.239
Help me here.

15:07.241 --> 15:09.858
Jimmy, you try and take my flag,
I'll take it to a reporter.

15:09.860 --> 15:12.694
10-minute recess!

15:19.036 --> 15:20.836
Goddamn judge needs
to come down here

15:20.838 --> 15:23.338
- and see what he started.
- Mm.

15:24.541 --> 15:26.375
It's a shitstorm
out there,

15:26.377 --> 15:28.760
and Spallone's
leading the charge.

15:28.762 --> 15:30.879
You want to hear
my good news or what?

15:30.881 --> 15:32.681
Come on,
take a guess.

15:34.601 --> 15:37.219
Ralph Arred thinks I should
run for mayor against Angelo.

15:37.221 --> 15:39.888
Offered me $40,000.

15:48.449 --> 15:50.699
- Who was that?
- That's Oscar Newman.

15:50.701 --> 15:52.818
He's the expert we hired
to consult on the housing.

15:52.820 --> 15:54.403
We tried
to fire him twice,

15:54.405 --> 15:55.904
and now the judge
is making us pay the guy

15:55.906 --> 15:57.823
to help us build the housing
whether we like it or not.

15:57.825 --> 16:00.292
Within this crowd, you don't want
to stand within 10 feet of the guy.

16:00.294 --> 16:04.079
So, "Nick Wasicsko
for Mayor"?

16:05.749 --> 16:08.083
Of Yonkers?

16:08.085 --> 16:10.919
Good one.
Let's talk.

16:15.843 --> 16:17.809
Not working today?

16:20.147 --> 16:22.431
Store closed?

16:22.433 --> 16:24.099
No, I'm off.

16:25.319 --> 16:26.601
What are you doing
with the day?

16:29.690 --> 16:31.440
You got a plan
for the day?

16:31.442 --> 16:33.442
Going down School.

16:33.444 --> 16:35.410
School Street?
What for?

16:36.363 --> 16:37.863
To see my sister.

16:37.865 --> 16:40.198
We left out of there
10 years ago.

16:40.200 --> 16:42.667
I just don't know why
you keep going back.

16:42.669 --> 16:44.119
Ma, are you ready?

16:44.121 --> 16:46.621
I'm gonna be late my own self
if we don't get out of here.

16:49.293 --> 16:51.793
<i>- Are those my earrings?</i>
<i>- No.</i>

16:51.795 --> 16:54.096
<i>They look like</i>
<i>a pair I'm missing...</i>

16:59.636 --> 17:02.137
Tell Gail
big sis said, "Hey."

17:17.287 --> 17:19.320
It's just down
to foot-dragging at this point

17:19.323 --> 17:21.205
and the judge won't
put a stop to it.

17:21.208 --> 17:24.709
He could. He could impose a
housing desegregation plan

17:24.711 --> 17:26.828
with or without the
cooperation of Yonkers.

17:26.829 --> 17:28.463
Why doesn't he?

17:28.464 --> 17:31.333
He thinks it's better for the
city government to participate.

17:31.335 --> 17:34.553
He thinks that once they
realize that the fight's over

17:34.555 --> 17:36.388
that they'll
come around.

17:38.175 --> 17:40.559
The people have been doing
the same thing for 50 years.

17:40.561 --> 17:42.511
They're not--
not just gonna change.

17:42.513 --> 17:45.931
You don't mean to suggest that white
folk aren't gonna welcome us?

17:47.067 --> 17:50.569
Look, like it or not--
like it or not,

17:50.571 --> 17:52.938
Yonkers has to put 200 units
of low-income housing

17:52.940 --> 17:55.273
on the white side
of the Saw Mill River Parkway,

17:55.275 --> 17:57.025
and when Judge Sand
loses patience,

17:57.027 --> 17:59.995
they'll desegregate
or they'll be held in contempt.

17:59.997 --> 18:01.947
The contempt is there
no matter what.

18:01.949 --> 18:04.749
<i>Preach, brother.</i>

18:07.871 --> 18:09.504
- Ben? Ben.
- Hang on.

18:09.506 --> 18:12.624
Do you think I could just--
could I have a minute, please?

18:15.679 --> 18:18.213
Are you guys pissed at me
about something?

18:18.215 --> 18:20.549
Did I do
something wrong?

18:20.551 --> 18:22.717
This is a victory
for the NAACP.

18:22.719 --> 18:26.137
It's a--
it's an honest-to-God legal precedent.

18:26.139 --> 18:28.607
How many other cities just pile
the low-income housing

18:28.609 --> 18:29.891
into black
neighborhoods

18:29.893 --> 18:32.194
or use federal money
to segregate?

18:32.196 --> 18:35.363
This is--
it's a big win for the movement.

18:35.365 --> 18:38.483
10 years ago,
I would've agreed.

18:38.485 --> 18:40.235
Back then, I'd have
seen this case

18:40.237 --> 18:42.370
- as the answer to a problem.
- Okay.

18:42.372 --> 18:44.239
Most of us
would have,

18:44.241 --> 18:47.409
but we've been at this game
a long time, Mike.

18:47.411 --> 18:49.794
Longer than you,
and a lot of us are at the point

18:49.796 --> 18:52.047
where if they don't
want to live with us,

18:52.049 --> 18:53.582
then why should we want
to live with them?

18:53.584 --> 18:55.000
Ah, come on.
What?

18:55.002 --> 18:58.086
Are you--
are you serious?

18:58.088 --> 18:59.754
I don't know.

18:59.756 --> 19:01.923
Maybe I've grown old
in this fight.

19:01.925 --> 19:03.642
Maybe the fight
has grown old to me,

19:03.644 --> 19:06.645
but watching how
this has played out

19:06.647 --> 19:08.647
over the last
seven years,

19:08.649 --> 19:10.398
how much we're
going through

19:10.400 --> 19:13.268
for a few hundred
scattered units of housing...

19:13.270 --> 19:18.273
The Executive Director of the NAACP
is arguing against integration.

19:18.275 --> 19:20.108
- Who'd have thought it?
- No.

19:20.110 --> 19:22.494
I'm not arguing
against anything, Mike.

19:22.496 --> 19:24.279
I'm just tired.

19:47.604 --> 19:52.140
I like Yonkers better than Jersey.

19:57.314 --> 19:59.814
Yo. They fiending
today, boy.

19:59.816 --> 20:02.150
Time to head back over
to Riverdale for that re-up.

20:04.488 --> 20:06.821
Yo, you met Doreen,
Gail's sister?

20:06.823 --> 20:08.823
This is my brother
Skipper...

20:08.825 --> 20:11.793
- after that peanut butter.
- Oh, come on, man.

20:11.795 --> 20:13.795
No, true dat.
Yo, you ate so much of that shit

20:13.797 --> 20:16.247
when you was comin' up,
we had to tag you with that shit.

20:16.249 --> 20:18.667
Yo, you stupid.

20:18.669 --> 20:22.220
Nuh-uh, Gail didn't say
nothing about no sister, now.

20:22.222 --> 20:24.422
I'd have
remembered that.

20:24.424 --> 20:26.508
Yes, I would.
Mm-hmm.

20:26.510 --> 20:28.727
Police?

20:30.847 --> 20:33.231
Yo, if them off-brand,
professor-looking bitches be police,

20:33.233 --> 20:35.850
ain't nobody getting caught doing shit.

20:35.852 --> 20:39.821
<i>Look at the beard on that Abe
Lincoln-looking motherfucker, yo.</i>

20:39.823 --> 20:41.406
<i>God damn.</i>

20:41.408 --> 20:42.691
Pass it.

20:42.693 --> 20:45.026
He got a grip on them
emancipation papers.

20:45.028 --> 20:47.612
<i>That shit ain't gonna work</i>
<i>up in the projects. Shit.</i>

20:50.283 --> 20:51.416
<i>We cooked, Mama.</i>

20:51.418 --> 20:55.120
Tia Dama showed me
a recipe-- sancocho.

20:55.122 --> 20:56.454
<i>Maria wanted to cook.</i>

20:56.456 --> 20:58.206
<i>I couldn't keep her</i>
<i>out of the kitchen.</i>

21:01.712 --> 21:05.130
Mm!
It's really good, little girl.

21:11.855 --> 21:15.807
<i>Do you know the Mota</i>
<i>family in Building Two?</i>

21:15.809 --> 21:18.393
- Gabriella's boys?
- Mm.

21:20.897 --> 21:23.565
Just yesterday
they were little.

21:29.956 --> 21:32.907
They're older now.

21:34.461 --> 21:36.494
How much longer
for the city of Yonkers

21:36.496 --> 21:39.080
to comply with the order
of this court, of this judge?

21:39.082 --> 21:41.383
- Your Honor, compliance with
the court order-- - Compliance.

21:41.385 --> 21:44.219
This is 657 pages.

21:44.221 --> 21:45.587
The finding?

21:45.589 --> 21:48.306
Yonkers intentionally
segregated its housing

21:48.308 --> 21:50.175
and its schools
for 40 years.

21:50.177 --> 21:52.894
This is a decision.
It was issued a year and a half ago.

21:52.896 --> 21:54.262
I, too, am growing
impatient.

21:54.264 --> 21:57.515
Your Honor, when there is a
violation of the Constitution,

21:57.517 --> 21:59.934
the remedy cannot be ignored
because it is unpopular.

21:59.936 --> 22:02.070
On the subject
of the housing remedy, Your Honor--

22:02.072 --> 22:06.141
- Mr. Newman. - Your Honor,
the court's idea of concentrating

22:06.143 --> 22:09.611
200 public housing units
on just two sites is--

22:09.613 --> 22:11.446
well, I think
there's a better way.

22:11.448 --> 22:13.114
We're only talking
about 200 units

22:13.116 --> 22:15.450
in a city
of 200,000 people.

22:15.452 --> 22:18.336
Yes, but you want it on just
two sites in East Yonkers.

22:18.338 --> 22:20.288
For that to work,
those 200 units

22:20.290 --> 22:22.457
would have to be
spread out over more sites--

22:22.459 --> 22:24.876
- maybe eight or 10.
- Eight or 10 sites?

22:24.878 --> 22:26.461
Too many units
in any neighborhood

22:26.463 --> 22:28.346
won't blend in
with the community.

22:28.348 --> 22:29.848
It becomes isolated
and divisive.

22:29.850 --> 22:32.300
Any low-income housing
in Yonkers is divisive.

22:32.302 --> 22:34.219
- That's how they see it.
- Your Honor, for the record,

22:34.221 --> 22:36.304
Yonkers' city officials agree
with Mr. Newman's assessment.

22:36.306 --> 22:39.057
All Yonkers' city officials care
about is getting reelected.

22:39.059 --> 22:41.609
<i>If they can use another
study to keep them</i>

22:41.611 --> 22:44.612
from doing anything until after
the next election, they will.

22:48.151 --> 22:50.034
I'd like to hear
Mr. Newman out.

22:50.036 --> 22:51.986
<i>Your Honor, first off,</i>

22:51.988 --> 22:54.372
<i>to make your remedy
order successful...</i>

23:00.297 --> 23:01.913
Jim.

23:01.915 --> 23:03.832
- Hey.
- Hey.

23:03.834 --> 23:05.416
- My brother Michael.
- Hey.

23:05.418 --> 23:07.085
- Hey.
- Mike, Jim Surdoval.

23:07.087 --> 23:09.671
All right. You lose those glasses,
we could run <i> you</i> for office.

23:09.673 --> 23:12.173
All right, Jim, what do you got?

23:12.175 --> 23:14.642
Ralph offered it to Frank
McGovern before you,

23:14.644 --> 23:17.178
- but Frank didn't think Angelo
was beatable. - Son of a bitch.

23:17.180 --> 23:19.063
And if you do win,
he'll be the first

23:19.065 --> 23:22.767
- to tell you how good he's been to you.
- Unbelievable.

23:22.769 --> 23:25.069
What the fuck?
Maybe Angelo is vulnerable.

23:25.071 --> 23:26.571
You know, if we can
exploit his weaknesses

23:26.573 --> 23:28.490
or, I don't know,
make you into a statesman.

23:28.492 --> 23:31.776
- Funny. - No, but I'm saying he's been
in there a long time, right?

23:31.778 --> 23:33.945
- So, you know, he's probably
made some enemies. - Here you go.

23:33.947 --> 23:36.114
He's made a lot of friends, too.
Thank you.

23:36.116 --> 23:37.866
Boom. Maybe we
bang him on that,

23:37.868 --> 23:40.752
- on putting them all on the city payroll.
- Yeah, imagine that.

23:40.754 --> 23:43.588
Patronage-- appointing friends,
not enemies to important posts.

23:43.590 --> 23:47.375
I mean, when you're mayor, Nick,
I expect a cushy board job, too.

23:47.377 --> 23:49.711
His IDA appointees
giving tax breaks

23:49.713 --> 23:53.181
to fat-cat developers
who don't deserve them.

23:53.183 --> 23:55.183
- That's pretty boring, right?
- Yeah, that.

23:55.185 --> 23:57.185
Not like there's
a scandal there.

23:57.187 --> 23:59.053
He's twice Nick's age.

23:59.055 --> 24:00.805
He's got
a confrontational style.

24:00.807 --> 24:02.524
People complain
about it.

24:03.944 --> 24:06.561
"Don't get mad, get a new mayor."

24:06.563 --> 24:08.396
I don't know what that meant
the last time you used it

24:08.398 --> 24:09.898
and told them to get
a new councilman.

24:09.900 --> 24:12.734
Well, you know what,
it kicked out a six-term incumbent, so...

24:12.736 --> 24:14.652
But, Nick, you vote
with Angelo mostly.

24:14.654 --> 24:17.872
You're right.
You're right.

24:17.874 --> 24:20.658
Come to think of it, Angelo's been
a pretty good mayor after all.

24:22.329 --> 24:24.579
Fuck it.
He's got my vote.

24:26.633 --> 24:30.001
Springsteen?

24:30.003 --> 24:32.971
This again?

24:32.973 --> 24:36.391
- Oh, come on.
- It's my theme song.

27:10.914 --> 27:13.548
Vote Nick Wasicsko
for Mayor."

27:13.550 --> 27:17.051
Add in "leadership,"
and you've hit for the cycle.

27:17.053 --> 27:19.087
What's your bumper
sticker gonna say?

27:19.089 --> 27:22.140
Mine? "Nick Longo is an asshole."

27:22.142 --> 27:23.341
Seriously.
What's it matter?

27:23.343 --> 27:24.759
The way they
redrew my district,

27:24.761 --> 27:26.728
I lose to Longo by eight
points no matter what.

27:26.730 --> 27:28.429
I know.
I'm sorry, Vin.

27:28.431 --> 27:30.598
You should've run
for mayor like me.

27:30.600 --> 27:33.568
It's always better to lose
big than to lose small.

27:33.570 --> 27:35.436
Uh-- hey.

27:35.438 --> 27:38.489
Um, any of you guys
want some fresh coffee?

27:38.491 --> 27:40.274
I just put a pot on.

27:40.276 --> 27:42.160
- Yeah, I'd love some.
- No, I'm good.

27:42.162 --> 27:44.779
- Thank you.
- Sure.

27:47.283 --> 27:49.500
That's Harry Oxman's new secretary.

27:49.502 --> 27:51.619
Or, as I like to call her,
"The future Mrs. Wasicsko,"

27:51.621 --> 27:53.538
though she knows it not.

27:53.540 --> 27:56.424
Well, she's cute, Nick.
You could do a lot worse.

27:56.426 --> 27:59.761
In fact, you <i> have</i>
done a lot worse.

27:59.763 --> 28:02.713
"Leadership, lechery, commitment.
Vote Wasicsko."

28:02.715 --> 28:05.299
Oh, yeah, that's better.
You're getting there.

28:05.301 --> 28:07.268
And I can
work with both parties

28:07.270 --> 28:09.520
without any
political consideration.

28:09.522 --> 28:11.272
That's what
experience gives you.

28:11.274 --> 28:13.307
The more you serve, the more
you're able to do what's right--

28:13.309 --> 28:15.309
letting the chips fall
where they may.

28:15.311 --> 28:17.812
Angelo, there's been a lot of
opposition to the housing initiative.

28:17.814 --> 28:20.148
Well, that's an understatement.

28:20.150 --> 28:22.150
<i>I think that by and large</i>

28:22.152 --> 28:26.287
the people of Yonkers understand
that a federal judge has ruled

28:26.289 --> 28:28.656
and the city must now
comply with the law.

28:28.658 --> 28:30.491
<i>Nick Wasicsko is a
first-term councilman.</i>

28:30.493 --> 28:32.743
It doesn't seem like
much of a race, does it?

28:32.745 --> 28:35.079
I expect
a quiet campaign.

28:36.583 --> 28:38.499
No, listen,
I say so because

28:38.501 --> 28:41.219
my opponent has voted
with me on most issues.

28:41.221 --> 28:43.171
But Nick--

28:43.173 --> 28:46.841
Nick's a smart guy
with a lot of promise,

28:46.843 --> 28:49.677
so I am taking nothing
for granted.

28:53.433 --> 28:55.766
Hi, ma'am. How you doing?
I'm Nick Wasicsko.

28:55.768 --> 28:57.685
I'm running for
mayor of Yonkers.

28:57.687 --> 28:59.821
You don't wanna
take this with you?

29:01.357 --> 29:03.858
- Nick Wasicsko. I'm running for mayor.
- Nah.

29:03.859 --> 29:07.069
_

29:07.104 --> 29:08.613
Hi, how you doing?

29:08.615 --> 29:10.531
- I'm Nick Wasicsko. I'm running for mayor.
- No, not now.

29:10.533 --> 29:12.617
Sure? You can take that pamphlet with you.
Look at it at home.

29:12.619 --> 29:14.085
No, thanks.

29:14.087 --> 29:15.503
Hi, ma'am.
How you doing?

29:15.505 --> 29:17.004
Can I help you
with your items?

29:17.006 --> 29:18.873
- Yeah? Your store items here?
- Okay.

29:18.875 --> 29:21.425
- Looks like you need a hand.
- Thank you.

29:21.427 --> 29:23.211
How you doing?

29:23.213 --> 29:26.714
- I'm Nick Wasicsko. What's your name?
- Uh, Marie.

29:26.716 --> 29:28.516
Nick Wasicsko.
I'm running for mayor.

29:28.518 --> 29:31.719
Mayor of Yonkers. Hope to have
your support in the election.

29:31.721 --> 29:34.305
It's W-A-S-I-C-S-K-O.
Spelled just like it sounds.

29:34.307 --> 29:36.224
- Okay.
- I'm running for mayor of Yonkers.

29:36.226 --> 29:38.643
You wanna just take it home
and take a look at it?

29:41.731 --> 29:44.732
Doesn't cost anything.
You just gotta read it.

29:44.734 --> 29:46.901
I'm sorry. Ma'am, where
exactly are you parked?

29:46.903 --> 29:50.371
Oh, I got no car. I live six
blocks over, up on Warburton.

29:50.373 --> 29:53.291
Are you fucking
kidding me?

29:58.915 --> 30:02.300
Hi. How's it going there?
How are you two doing?

30:02.302 --> 30:03.968
- Are you registered to vote?
- No.

30:03.970 --> 30:06.254
I'm Nick Wasicsko.
I'd like to be your mayor.

30:18.184 --> 30:19.767
Oh, my God!

30:19.769 --> 30:22.770
- Ooh! I'm sorry!
- Jesus. Oh, God!

30:22.772 --> 30:25.606
Oh, come on.
I'm sorry, baby.

30:38.504 --> 30:41.289
Mr. Hobart?

30:41.291 --> 30:43.624
What time is it?

30:43.626 --> 30:46.794
Mr. Rodriguez was supposed to
relieve me at 4:00.

30:47.764 --> 30:50.047
It's 2:00.

30:50.049 --> 30:52.717
It is?

30:52.719 --> 30:55.853
Seems later
than that.

30:57.473 --> 31:00.391
I'm having trouble
with my eyes.

31:10.653 --> 31:12.486
Fuck this.

31:38.014 --> 31:41.098
- Hi.
- I'm gonna be a while.

31:41.100 --> 31:44.352
Okay.
How long you thinking?

31:44.354 --> 31:46.570
Hours,
it looks like.

31:53.029 --> 31:54.829
All right, yeah.

31:54.831 --> 31:57.365
Thinks he's gonna run against Angelo
and get help around here?

31:57.367 --> 31:58.699
He's crazy.

32:07.343 --> 32:09.343
Nick...

32:09.345 --> 32:11.095
there's another one
in the basement.

32:12.382 --> 32:15.599
- What?
- A copy machine.

32:16.769 --> 32:18.803
Oh.

32:18.805 --> 32:20.354
Yeah, well...

32:22.225 --> 32:24.975
I'm sure that one only works for
Angelo, too, though, right?

32:24.977 --> 32:26.193
Well, you can't
blame people.

32:26.195 --> 32:29.146
I mean everyone in here owes
their job to Martinelli.

32:29.148 --> 32:31.782
Yeah.
No, I know. I know.

32:31.784 --> 32:33.984
Well, you can
give it to me,

32:33.986 --> 32:35.202
and I'll get it
copied for you.

32:35.204 --> 32:37.488
Just don't
tell anyone.

32:37.490 --> 32:39.957
Oh. Well,
that's very nice.

32:39.959 --> 32:41.459
No, but I need like
300 of these, though.

32:41.461 --> 32:44.462
Sure.

32:44.464 --> 32:46.380
Wow. I really
appreciate that.

32:46.382 --> 32:49.083
And if you want, you can put
a sign on my father's house.

32:49.085 --> 32:50.468
We're on
Pier Street.

32:50.470 --> 32:54.305
What would, uh, vice man
Harry Oxman think, though?

32:54.307 --> 32:57.258
Um, well,
he's my boss, right?

32:57.260 --> 32:59.760
- Yeah.
- But I-- I vote how I like.

33:01.064 --> 33:02.847
Okay.

33:02.849 --> 33:04.598
Hey, it's
the American way, right?

33:04.600 --> 33:07.685
If you say so, yeah.

33:07.687 --> 33:10.738
- I appreciate that. Thank you.
- You got it.

33:10.740 --> 33:13.607
- All right. I'll see you around.
- Yeah.

33:16.662 --> 33:19.246
<i>Hey, Ma.</i>

33:19.248 --> 33:20.948
<i>Hey.</i>

33:25.788 --> 33:28.255
Feel better?

33:28.257 --> 33:30.791
You ain't seein'
no better?

33:30.793 --> 33:34.678
I suppose I need
a little more rest.

33:34.680 --> 33:36.847
You've been in bed
four days now.

33:36.849 --> 33:38.466
How much more rest
you gonna give it?

33:39.469 --> 33:40.801
I'm calling
the doctor, Ma.

33:40.803 --> 33:42.937
- <i> Oh, no, Dwayne--</i>
- No, Ma, I'm calling.

33:58.654 --> 34:01.622
- Thanks for the lift.
- Yeah, no problem.

34:01.624 --> 34:05.743
It's on the way to the
Italian-American forum tonight, so...

34:05.745 --> 34:07.661
Every night's
some other event, huh?

34:07.663 --> 34:09.246
- Yeah, well.
- It's crazy.

34:09.248 --> 34:11.132
I know. If you wanna
be the mayor,

34:11.134 --> 34:13.083
you gotta work
at it, right?

34:13.085 --> 34:15.302
- Yeah.
- And, um...

34:15.304 --> 34:19.005
well, don't tell anybody, but I
always wanted to be the mayor.

34:19.007 --> 34:20.341
- Really?
- Yeah.

34:20.342 --> 34:23.594
It's true, I swear.

34:23.596 --> 34:26.096
I used to talk about it
all the time growing up.

34:26.098 --> 34:28.098
The other kids used to call me
"the mayor."

34:28.100 --> 34:31.485
- Really?
- It wasn't a compliment.

34:31.487 --> 34:33.687
But, you know,
I try to take it as one.

34:33.688 --> 34:35.773
- Mm-hmm.
- So...

34:35.775 --> 34:37.024
Yeah.

34:37.025 --> 34:39.025
All right,
I better go in.

34:39.027 --> 34:41.661
- My parents will worry about me.
- Yeah, okay.

34:41.664 --> 34:43.781
- Have a good night, okay?
- All right, yeah. It's just--

34:43.783 --> 34:45.331
'Night--

34:48.670 --> 34:52.206
- That was weird.
- Was it?

34:53.342 --> 34:55.458
I just-- you kinda
caught me off guard.

34:55.460 --> 34:58.379
- Um, I'd better go in now.
- Okay.

34:58.381 --> 35:01.882
- We should talk.
- Yeah, okay. Monday.

35:01.884 --> 35:04.134
- Okay.
- All right, bye.

35:04.136 --> 35:06.270
- Good night.
- Yeah, good night.

35:16.065 --> 35:17.948
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

35:22.405 --> 35:25.573
<i>I have long despaired of
giving civic lessons in Yonkers,</i>

35:25.575 --> 35:28.909
<i>but if a detailed plan for
200 units of public housing</i>

35:28.911 --> 35:31.629
<i>is not approved by the council</i>
<i>before next Thursday,</i>

35:31.631 --> 35:33.881
<i>Yonkers will be</i>
<i>in contempt of court.</i>

35:33.883 --> 35:36.667
Fines will commence and be
doubled every day thereafter.

35:36.669 --> 35:38.219
- Your Honor?
- Mr. Sculnick?

35:38.221 --> 35:39.970
Your Honor, holding
the city in contempt

35:39.972 --> 35:42.473
would serve only to divide
the city council further,

35:42.475 --> 35:45.309
and the fines would damage
the city's bond rating,

35:45.311 --> 35:46.594
close the door
to borrowing,

35:46.596 --> 35:48.429
and cause property
values to plummet.

35:48.431 --> 35:49.763
All of which
is of little moment

35:49.765 --> 35:52.149
to those suffering the
deprivation of their rights.

35:52.151 --> 35:55.102
Your Honor, you could impose your
own integration plan on the city.

35:55.104 --> 35:57.438
Mr. Sculnick, I was not
elected to represent Yonkers.

35:57.440 --> 36:00.658
<i>Your Honor, the city
council is bitterly divided.</i>

36:00.660 --> 36:02.943
Threatening to fine the city
will only force each side

36:02.945 --> 36:04.028
to dig their heels
in further.

36:04.030 --> 36:05.913
Mr. Sculnick,
the City of Yonkers

36:05.915 --> 36:07.998
now faces a choice
of compliance

36:08.000 --> 36:10.451
<i>or receivership until</i>
<i>a housing plan is approved.</i>

36:10.453 --> 36:13.370
- Am I understood?
- Yes, Your Honor.

36:13.372 --> 36:15.673
We're adjourned.

36:15.675 --> 36:17.258
<i>All rise.</i>

36:21.013 --> 36:24.465
Number one
or number two?

36:24.467 --> 36:28.302
Neither.
I-- I just see color.

36:28.304 --> 36:30.554
You don't see the top
line on the chart?

36:30.556 --> 36:33.307
I see dark red,

36:33.309 --> 36:38.479
and it's mostly round,
whatever it is.

36:42.618 --> 36:44.868
It's the diabetes,
Miss O'Neal.

36:46.322 --> 36:48.289
Is it gonna
get better?

36:52.078 --> 36:55.296
Yeah, I know. I think that we
could have a nice time together.

36:55.298 --> 36:57.164
Get to know each other
a little better, you know?

36:57.166 --> 36:58.999
How does that look, though?

37:00.803 --> 37:03.220
You're running for mayor,
and I work in the office.

37:03.222 --> 37:04.722
- Yeah.
- Okay.

37:04.724 --> 37:07.341
Well,
we'll be careful, you know?

37:07.343 --> 37:08.976
Nobody will know
anything.

37:08.978 --> 37:10.644
I'm serious.

37:10.646 --> 37:13.647
I wanna take it slow
and see where this goes

37:13.649 --> 37:16.150
before everyone in here
is talking about me.

37:16.152 --> 37:18.235
- I love slow.
- Okay, great.

37:18.237 --> 37:20.738
- Okay, all right. I'll see you later.
- Okay, go--

37:22.158 --> 37:23.991
What the fuck?

37:29.081 --> 37:30.664
<i>Sand's threatening fines</i>

37:30.666 --> 37:33.167
<i>that will bankrupt</i>
<i>the city in 22 days.</i>

37:33.169 --> 37:36.453
That is Russian roulette
with five bullets in the chamber.

37:36.455 --> 37:37.755
Sorry.

37:37.757 --> 37:41.425
I got, uh, buttonholed
out in the hallway.

37:41.427 --> 37:42.593
Angry constituent.

37:44.096 --> 37:46.463
200 units on four
possible sites.

37:46.465 --> 37:48.349
It's not the end
of the world, guys.

37:48.351 --> 37:50.050
We spread it
around.

37:50.052 --> 37:51.885
No district gets
more than one site,

37:51.887 --> 37:54.555
no site gets more
than 50 or so units.

37:54.557 --> 37:56.390
I'm thinking maybe
we double the number

37:56.392 --> 37:57.858
of proposed
housing sites.

37:57.860 --> 38:00.310
Eight sites means less units
in any one neighborhood.

38:00.312 --> 38:03.030
Less anger from voters.
We spread the pain thinner.

38:03.032 --> 38:05.783
Or we dump all of them in
Spallone's district. Either way.

38:05.785 --> 38:07.735
Like I said,

38:07.737 --> 38:09.536
it's better to be
on the inside

38:09.538 --> 38:12.072
when a deal
goes down.

38:12.074 --> 38:14.958
I'm asking you all
to be cosponsors.

38:14.960 --> 38:16.744
I'm not gonna bother
with Spallone on them.

38:16.746 --> 38:19.380
- We know how they stand.
- Christ, an election year?

38:19.382 --> 38:20.998
Tell me about it.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.083
- Thank you.
<i>- Look, I know you guys</i>

38:23.085 --> 38:25.552
would rather do nothing and let
the judge pick the sites himself,

38:25.554 --> 38:27.304
but the judge
ain't buying that.

38:27.306 --> 38:29.757
- He put it on us.
- I can't be a cosponsor.

38:29.759 --> 38:31.508
I just can't have
my name on it.

38:31.510 --> 38:34.061
- Come on, Frank.
- Yeah, but you can vote for it, right?

38:34.063 --> 38:37.097
Or Angelo will put three of the
eight sites in your district.

38:37.099 --> 38:39.433
Look, I understand complying

38:39.435 --> 38:41.685
and that the law is the law,
but what about our appeal?

38:41.687 --> 38:44.071
We should have never
appealed in the first place.

38:44.073 --> 38:46.440
Not a chance in hell
they'll overturn Sand.

38:46.442 --> 38:47.908
But we're still
paying the lawyers

38:47.910 --> 38:49.410
to carry it
to the second circuit,

38:49.412 --> 38:50.661
so if you wanna
tell the voters

38:50.663 --> 38:53.864
you're fighting it
in the courts, you can.

38:53.866 --> 38:55.916
Honestly, guys,
I think this is

38:55.918 --> 38:58.669
the only responsible
option we have.

38:58.671 --> 39:01.205
You think about it over
lunch, and I want a "yes."

39:01.207 --> 39:02.506
Ha.

39:05.377 --> 39:07.294
After you.

39:08.297 --> 39:10.514
- Wanna grab some lunch?
- Nick?

39:12.935 --> 39:15.352
How's it going out there
on the hustings?

39:15.354 --> 39:17.438
- Tough racket, huh?
- Yeah.

39:17.440 --> 39:20.057
I hear you're out there
pounding the pavement,

39:20.059 --> 39:22.192
pressing the flesh.

39:22.194 --> 39:24.561
Hey, don't worry.

39:24.563 --> 39:25.896
You'll hit your stride.

39:25.898 --> 39:28.449
I'll see you, Angelo.

39:31.320 --> 39:32.653
Outwardly,
he's calm.

39:32.655 --> 39:34.788
Inside, he's
terrified of me.

39:34.790 --> 39:36.073
Absolutely terrified.

39:36.075 --> 39:38.208
Yeah, well,
at least if you lose,

39:38.210 --> 39:40.127
you'll lose to
a six-term incumbent.

39:40.129 --> 39:43.163
- Me?
- No. You'll pull it out, Vin.

39:43.165 --> 39:44.248
You will.

39:44.250 --> 39:46.834
Well, nice of you
to say so.

39:48.420 --> 39:50.137
<i>Because I don't
think any of these people</i>

39:50.139 --> 39:52.256
<i>understand the simple fact</i>
<i>that the law doesn't guarantee</i>

39:52.258 --> 39:54.508
that you get to live in a
neighborhood that you can't afford.

39:54.510 --> 39:55.843
Am I right?

39:55.845 --> 39:57.845
<i>And last I gotta say</i>
<i>that maybe this judge,</i>

39:57.847 --> 40:00.013
<i>if he likes the people who live
in public housing so much,</i>

40:00.015 --> 40:01.682
<i>then maybe he should have</i>
<i>that kind of housing</i>

40:01.684 --> 40:03.684
in his neighborhood
where he lives.

40:03.686 --> 40:06.186
- See how he likes it.
- We're not prejudiced.

40:06.188 --> 40:08.939
<i>We just object to giving</i>
<i>housing subsidies in an area</i>

40:08.941 --> 40:10.941
where people have worked
so hard to afford their homes.

40:10.943 --> 40:12.526
Sir, you've already had
your chance to speak.

40:12.528 --> 40:15.779
Anyone is welcome to live in my
neighborhood if they have the money.

40:15.781 --> 40:18.031
<i>I'm just saying</i>
<i>that this city council--</i>

40:18.033 --> 40:20.117
<i>...a long list of residents
who have signed up to speak.</i>

40:20.119 --> 40:22.085
<i>- We wanna hear what he has to say!</i>
<i>- Let me have my say.</i>

40:22.087 --> 40:23.871
I'm gonna ask you
one more time, sir.

40:23.873 --> 40:27.124
- <i> Please have a seat.</i>
- I just wanna say one last thing.

40:27.126 --> 40:29.042
Sir, you are not
going to speak again.

40:29.044 --> 40:31.378
<i>- One last thing.</i>
<i>- Sir, you are done speaking.</i>

40:31.380 --> 40:35.549
- <i> You have spoken your case.</i>
- Let him speak!

40:44.727 --> 40:46.860
- Oh, morning, Hank.
- Morning.

40:48.063 --> 40:50.314
Morning, Anne Marie.
You lurking or stalking?

40:50.316 --> 40:53.567
- Did you see the "Times"?
- Not yet.

40:53.569 --> 40:55.569
Seems the council
finally had the courage

40:55.571 --> 40:57.538
to make
the right decision.

40:57.540 --> 40:59.239
Well, eight
of them, anyway.

40:59.241 --> 41:01.458
That was the vote, right?
Eight to five?

41:01.460 --> 41:02.793
Maybe we've turned
a corner here.

41:02.795 --> 41:05.045
You think so?

41:05.047 --> 41:08.081
- We're talking about Yonkers.
- True.

41:09.418 --> 41:11.301
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

41:22.064 --> 41:25.732
So, uh, I was thinking maybe
we'd go over to Mannion's.

41:25.734 --> 41:27.651
- Mannion's?
- Yeah, get a couple steaks.

41:27.653 --> 41:30.153
Yeah, so we can see
everyone we work with.

41:30.155 --> 41:32.322
- Oh, come on, they got
the best steaks in town. - No. No.

41:32.324 --> 41:34.274
Everybody goes there 'cause
it's a great restaurant.

41:34.276 --> 41:36.443
- I don't care.
- What are we gonna do, go to a drive-thru

41:36.445 --> 41:38.195
- where nobody'll see us?
- Look at that.

41:42.952 --> 41:44.785
They're making their own signs.
Look.

41:46.255 --> 41:48.755
Nay, they're making
their own goddamn signs.

41:56.632 --> 41:59.182
Holy shit.

42:06.525 --> 42:10.360
- This is Angelo's district.
- <i> Yeah.</i>

42:10.362 --> 42:13.196
Look, the housing case
is killing him

42:13.198 --> 42:15.949
in his own
fucking district.

42:15.951 --> 42:20.487
- Look at this.
- It's all you.

42:20.489 --> 42:21.955
Nick...

42:23.158 --> 42:24.825
My God.

42:24.827 --> 42:26.159
With the groceries
and the bus fare

42:26.161 --> 42:27.995
and money
for the Laundromat,

42:27.997 --> 42:31.214
I spend $30 less a month
than I make for you, Paul.

42:31.216 --> 42:34.134
That's $30 left to get me through
a month with three kids.

42:34.136 --> 42:36.503
I work my ass off
for you, Paul.

42:36.505 --> 42:37.754
<i>And at the end</i>
<i>of the month,</i>

42:37.756 --> 42:39.473
I have enough to take
my kids to a movie

42:39.475 --> 42:42.392
or maybe put a winter
coat on layaway.

42:42.394 --> 42:43.727
That's it.

42:45.681 --> 42:47.481
So what do you say?

42:53.105 --> 42:54.905
- Everywhere on the East Side, right?
- I saw.

42:54.907 --> 42:56.523
I drove around after you called.
I saw.

42:56.525 --> 42:58.158
- Hi.
- I don't understand.

42:58.160 --> 42:59.993
Why should they vote
for me over Angelo?

42:59.995 --> 43:02.029
- I mean, I haven't done--
- Because you're not Angelo.

43:02.031 --> 43:04.998
Yeah, but I voted the same way
as Angelo on almost everything,

43:05.000 --> 43:07.367
including the school
deseg and the housing.

43:07.369 --> 43:09.286
I mean, I was
cosponsor on his plan

43:09.288 --> 43:10.871
to give in to the judge,
for Christ's sake.

43:10.873 --> 43:12.289
But that one's
understandable,

43:12.291 --> 43:14.041
given the threat
of the city being fined.

43:14.043 --> 43:15.709
You were
responsible.

43:15.711 --> 43:18.795
The only thing that separates
me from him on the housing

43:18.797 --> 43:20.881
is the vote
to appeal last year.

43:20.883 --> 43:23.133
I voted to appeal the judge's
decision and he did not.

43:23.135 --> 43:24.134
And we hit that hard.

43:24.136 --> 43:25.635
Every day from now
until the polls open,

43:25.637 --> 43:27.387
we hit them
with the appeal vote.

43:28.524 --> 43:29.606
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

43:29.608 --> 43:31.191
Jim, why don't
you order something?

43:31.193 --> 43:33.443
No, no.
It's okay.

43:33.445 --> 43:35.228
We're on a date.
It's a date.

43:35.230 --> 43:37.230
No, we're--
we're not on a date.

43:37.232 --> 43:40.283
- Well, whatever it is,
you two enjoy yourselves. - Thank you.

43:40.285 --> 43:41.618
- Have a great night.
- Thank you.

43:41.620 --> 43:43.870
- A date?
- I mean, come on.

43:43.872 --> 43:45.956
Come on, what?

43:45.958 --> 43:49.042
<i>DR?</i>
<i>You remember DR?</i>

43:49.044 --> 43:51.745
I remember
it was cheaper, safer.

43:51.747 --> 43:54.047
It's like a prison
here for them.

43:54.049 --> 43:55.582
You're gonna move to DR?

43:55.584 --> 43:57.751
- I was happy there.
- Poor, too.

43:57.753 --> 43:59.419
And here I am
parking my Mercedes

43:59.421 --> 44:02.556
in front of Building Eight.

44:02.558 --> 44:05.892
To be poor in DR
was no crime.

44:05.894 --> 44:07.761
But here...

44:07.763 --> 44:11.598
Fuck, DR...

44:11.600 --> 44:14.101
See, I was the one who
voted to appeal last year

44:14.103 --> 44:16.069
to give Yonkers
its full day in court.

44:16.071 --> 44:17.571
My opponent did not.

44:17.573 --> 44:19.272
He was satisfied
with the judge's decision

44:19.274 --> 44:20.607
on the housing
desegregation case.

44:20.609 --> 44:21.525
I was not.

44:21.527 --> 44:23.777
Vote Wasicsko.
All right?

44:23.779 --> 44:25.278
It's time
for a new future.

44:25.280 --> 44:27.114
- Oh, I've heard about you.
- Okay? No more two years.

44:27.116 --> 44:29.116
- Not another two years. Vote Wasicsko.
- Good luck.

44:29.118 --> 44:30.617
Thank you.
Here you go.

44:30.619 --> 44:33.787
Vote for Wasicsko.
Vote for Yonkers' future, all right?

44:33.789 --> 44:35.789
- Okay, thanks.
- Thank you. Thank you very much.

44:35.791 --> 44:37.841
- Good for you.
- Go get him, kid.

44:37.843 --> 44:39.793
- Thank you, sir. Thank you.
- Angelo's dead to me now.

44:39.795 --> 44:41.928
Oh, well, all right.
Well, he's not dead yet, so...

44:41.930 --> 44:43.713
- Oh, thank you.
- ...vote for Wasicsko, okay?

44:43.715 --> 44:45.932
Martinelli's been
mayor a long time.

44:45.934 --> 44:48.101
Too long, in fact,
all right?

44:48.103 --> 44:49.636
He's no longer
listening to the voters,

44:49.638 --> 44:51.138
because what
I'm hearing--

44:51.140 --> 44:52.606
what he should
be hearing--

44:52.608 --> 44:54.024
is that the people
of Yonkers

44:54.026 --> 44:55.642
want the housing
decision appealed.

44:55.644 --> 44:58.061
You'll go to
the Supreme Court.

44:58.063 --> 45:01.314
That Jew judge ain't gonna
build that garbage nohow.

45:01.316 --> 45:02.699
- Okay, look, I don't--
- Not where I live.

45:02.701 --> 45:04.367
I hear ya.
I just don't think that we should--

45:04.369 --> 45:06.319
Tell that judge
to go shove it!

45:07.739 --> 45:09.406
It kinda brings out
the ugly in people.

45:09.408 --> 45:11.074
- So, you're the fella taking on Martinelli.
- That's me.

45:11.076 --> 45:12.826
- How do you do?
- I'm doing very well.

45:12.828 --> 45:14.327
I'll do better
if you vote for Wasicsko

45:14.329 --> 45:16.163
- come election night, all right?
- All right. You bet.

45:16.165 --> 45:18.665
I think the people of Yonkers
should have their say.

45:18.667 --> 45:20.300
And if the people
wanna have their say,

45:20.302 --> 45:23.253
they're gonna be voting for
Nick Wasicsko next Tuesday.

45:23.255 --> 45:28.175
My opponent has been in
office a long time...

45:29.094 --> 45:31.228
A lamb into a lion.

45:31.230 --> 45:34.147
Yeah. I should've
made McGovern run.

45:34.149 --> 45:36.349
Let the kid have
the council seat.

45:36.351 --> 45:39.236
Ah, it's the housing,
not him.

45:39.238 --> 45:42.072
Tell me about it.

45:42.074 --> 45:44.691
Fucking judge
fucked you good, Ange.

45:44.693 --> 45:46.359
You should've voted
for the appeal.

45:46.361 --> 45:49.913
Waste of money. That appeal goes nowhere.
You'll see.

45:49.915 --> 45:53.116
But, yeah, should've voted
for the goddamn thing.

45:53.118 --> 45:54.284
No fucking kidding.

45:54.286 --> 45:56.369
<i>I'll call you back.</i>

46:04.129 --> 46:06.046
I can't fit more
in that one.

46:06.048 --> 46:08.465
- What's left?
- My sweaters and books.

46:15.274 --> 46:17.274
It's warm there, right?

46:17.276 --> 46:19.359
But if we need them, your
cousins will be staying here.

46:19.361 --> 46:20.477
They can send
what we need.

46:20.479 --> 46:22.979
And I will buy you more
books when we get there.

46:22.981 --> 46:25.565
I promise.

46:30.372 --> 46:33.123
Felipe, we have to leave.

46:33.125 --> 46:34.658
Roberto.

46:42.050 --> 46:43.967
Don't worry. I'll take
care of everything.

46:43.969 --> 46:46.253
- <i> Gracias.</i>
- <i> De nada.</i>

47:16.418 --> 47:17.701
Longo beats Vinni.

47:17.703 --> 47:20.120
But I figured that.
She had no shot.

47:20.122 --> 47:21.922
But I can't believe
Frank McGovern

47:21.924 --> 47:24.040
going down to Chema
by almost two to one.

47:24.042 --> 47:26.543
Fagan's coming back.
Spallone won, Charlie Cola.

47:26.545 --> 47:27.961
Christ,
except for Oxman,

47:27.963 --> 47:31.047
everyone who was even moderate
on the housing got knocked off.

47:31.049 --> 47:32.849
I mean, shit,
even if I get in,

47:32.851 --> 47:34.684
I'm not gonna
have the votes.

47:34.686 --> 47:36.636
Nick Longo's
gonna have four votes

47:36.638 --> 47:38.355
and the council
in his pocket.

47:41.310 --> 47:45.061
These numbers?
Is that mostly East Side?

47:45.063 --> 47:48.982
Because if it's East Side,
I'm gonna-- I'm gonna drop this guy.

47:48.984 --> 47:51.901
Yeah. Surdoval's
on the line.

47:51.903 --> 47:55.372
- Hey, Jim, what do ya got?
- <i> East Side's coming in. Hold a sec.</i>

47:55.374 --> 47:57.157
Thanks.

47:57.159 --> 48:00.043
They're saying
he's losing the 11th.

48:00.045 --> 48:02.796
If Martinelli can't win
his home ward, it's over.

48:02.798 --> 48:05.215
I'm looking at
new numbers on TV.

48:06.501 --> 48:07.834
The AP called it.

48:07.836 --> 48:11.338
Christ. I win
by 1,500 votes.

48:21.233 --> 48:24.434
I'm the fuckin' mayor!

48:26.855 --> 48:28.321
I'm so proud of you!

48:28.323 --> 48:30.523
Thank you.

48:30.525 --> 48:33.360
Gonna start calling you the "miracle
candidate" for beating these odds.

48:33.362 --> 48:35.996
- Well--
- He did the same thing two years ago.

48:35.998 --> 48:37.697
Nobody thought
he'd win.

48:37.699 --> 48:40.000
<i>But did you really believe
you'd knock off Martinelli?</i>

48:40.002 --> 48:41.501
Well, I never
thought I'd lose.

48:41.503 --> 48:43.370
Hey, Martinelli's here.

48:47.592 --> 48:49.709
Uh, excuse me
for one second.

48:59.388 --> 49:02.355
- Congratulations, Nick.
- Thank you, Angelo.

49:02.357 --> 49:04.891
You know, the voters have
lifted a tremendous burden

49:04.893 --> 49:07.777
off of my shoulders
and placed it on yours.

49:07.779 --> 49:10.196
Well, I think these shoulders
will be able to handle it.

49:10.198 --> 49:13.066
- Well, good luck to you, Nick.
- Thank you, Angelo.

49:13.068 --> 49:14.067
- I'm happy for you.
- Mr. Mayor?

49:14.069 --> 49:15.535
Yes, Martha,
one second.

49:15.537 --> 49:17.404
- If you need anything, let me know.
- Thank you.

49:17.406 --> 49:19.456
So I guess the voters
decided not to get mad.

49:19.458 --> 49:22.542
No, no, no. You know,
I think that, uh...

49:22.544 --> 49:24.711
they were disappointed
in the last administration

49:24.713 --> 49:26.830
and they saw in me someone
that has the ability

49:26.832 --> 49:28.581
to change the direction
of the city.

49:30.001 --> 49:32.001
Are you surprised at the
margin of votes for you?

49:32.003 --> 49:33.503
You literally continued
to pull away.

49:33.505 --> 49:36.089
Well, you know, I talked to thousands
of people during this campaign,

49:36.091 --> 49:37.640
and they told me
they wanted a change,

49:37.642 --> 49:40.093
and I guess they voted
the way they spoke.

49:40.095 --> 49:41.761
- So--
- Excuse me.

49:41.763 --> 49:42.846
Congratulations.

49:42.848 --> 49:45.432
No, it was the housing
issue, not the candidate.

49:55.527 --> 49:57.944
First time getting
kissed by a mayor.

49:57.946 --> 50:00.864
Is it really? You mean Angelo
never slipped you one?

50:07.422 --> 50:09.456
Thank you!

50:10.842 --> 50:12.459
<i>Thank you.</i>

50:15.881 --> 50:17.680
Thank you!

50:17.682 --> 50:20.016
Thank you.

50:20.018 --> 50:23.186
Thank you, really.
I am truly honored.

50:30.028 --> 50:31.778
Wait, wha-- what do
you mean by "major"?

50:31.780 --> 50:33.813
Major cities,
cities that matter.

50:33.815 --> 50:34.864
Yonkers matters?

50:34.866 --> 50:37.066
Cities of 150,000
population or more.

50:37.068 --> 50:39.986
You are definitely the
youngest mayor in America.

50:39.988 --> 50:42.705
Which means you're
officially a rising star

50:42.707 --> 50:44.157
in the Democratic Party.

50:44.159 --> 50:46.159
Nice of Martinelli

50:46.161 --> 50:48.411
letting you work out of the
office before inauguration.

50:48.413 --> 50:51.548
A good man-- Angelo.
Hell of a guy.

50:57.973 --> 50:59.973
Where the hell is Cheryl?

50:59.975 --> 51:02.008
We can't just
leave the phones.

51:03.311 --> 51:04.677
Mayor's office.

51:04.679 --> 51:07.347
...big plans.

51:07.349 --> 51:10.150
- The lawyers on line one.
- The lawyers?

51:10.152 --> 51:11.851
The lawyers.

51:17.275 --> 51:19.075
Nick here.
Nick Wasicsko.

51:19.077 --> 51:21.945
The mayor.
Mayor-elect.

51:21.947 --> 51:24.531
Right.
Yeah, hi, Mike.

51:26.334 --> 51:28.201
Uh-huh.

51:30.372 --> 51:31.838
No grounds at all?

51:35.627 --> 51:37.510
Yeah.

51:39.598 --> 51:43.049
Right.
Okay, well, thank you.

51:44.019 --> 51:45.885
All right.
Bye-bye.

51:51.610 --> 51:53.726
They denied
that housing appeal.

51:56.114 --> 51:58.565
Sided with Sand
on every count.

52:06.658 --> 52:09.659
I voted for the appeal
and I lost.

52:11.830 --> 52:14.631
Nothing I can do
about that, right?

52:14.633 --> 52:16.749
Yeah, they can't
blame you.

52:19.221 --> 52:21.471
Right?

52:21.473 --> 52:23.256
Yeah.
