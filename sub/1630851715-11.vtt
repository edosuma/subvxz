WEBVTT

00:04.091 --> 00:05.701
HEY. WHAT WAS
UP WITH RYAN BEFORE?

00:05.744 --> 00:07.007
SHE DIDN'T
TELL YOU?

00:07.050 --> 00:09.226
- TELL ME WHAT?
- DOESN'T MATTER.

00:09.270 --> 00:10.575
I'M POISON IVY!

00:10.619 --> 00:12.316
YOU KILLED SOMEONE,
MARY.

00:12.360 --> 00:14.275
YOU THOUGHT YOU
JUST FLUNG HIM
OUT OF YOUR WAY,

00:14.318 --> 00:15.450
BUT YOU DIDN'T.

00:15.493 --> 00:16.842
HE'S DEAD.

00:16.886 --> 00:18.192
GIVE ME THE BUZZER.

00:18.235 --> 00:19.976
I'LL FIND A WAY
TO MAKE IT WORK.

00:20.020 --> 00:22.413
I WANT MY SON BACK
IN EXCHANGE.

00:22.457 --> 00:24.067
FINE.

00:24.111 --> 00:26.809
BY MIDNIGHT,
OR WE HAVE A PROBLEM.

00:32.380 --> 00:34.034
ET TU, BATWOMAN?

00:34.077 --> 00:35.992
GOTHAMITES ARE REELING
FROM THE REVELATION

00:36.036 --> 00:38.081
THAT IT WAS
THE SCARLET KNIGHT HERSELF

00:38.125 --> 00:40.083
WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE
FOR UNLEASHING

00:40.127 --> 00:42.825
BATVILLAINS PAST
ON AN UNSUSPECTING G-TOWN.

00:42.868 --> 00:45.480
THANKS TO BUSINESS QUEENPIN
JADA JET

00:45.523 --> 00:47.351
HAVING BLOWN THE WHISTLE,
WE NOW KNOW

00:47.395 --> 00:49.701
THAT WE HAVE
THE CAPED CRUSADER TO THANK

00:49.745 --> 00:52.226
FOR THE RECENT SPATE OF ROGUES
WHO HAVE PLAGUED THIS CITY,

00:52.269 --> 00:54.619
AND WHILE IT'S UNCLEAR
WHAT PROMPTED MS. JET

00:54.663 --> 00:56.534
TO BE SO CATTY TOWARDS BATTY,

00:56.578 --> 01:00.147
I FOR ONE AM DYING TO SEE
HOW THIS BAT SPAT PLAYS OUT.

01:00.190 --> 01:02.062
LUKE, ON COMMS:
BATBAR TO BATWOMAN.
WHEN WE DIVERTED

01:02.105 --> 01:03.889
THE WATER FROM THE DAM
TO THE SEWERS,
WE DIDN'T FACTOR IN

01:03.933 --> 01:05.674
GOTHAM'S CRAPPY
INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:05.717 --> 01:07.197
- BOTTOM LINE IT.
- CLOGGED SEWER BACKED UP.

01:07.241 --> 01:08.894
IT'S FLOODING THE AREA
AROUND MARY'S CLINIC.

01:08.938 --> 01:11.201
- IF THE WATER WAKES UP MARQUIS--
- I'M ON MY WAY.

01:27.130 --> 01:29.089
OH, MY GOD.

01:37.532 --> 01:39.534
NOTHING CREEPY
ABOUT THAT.

01:39.577 --> 01:41.101
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S SCARIER--

01:41.144 --> 01:44.539
HIM BEING GONE
OR...WHAT HE LEFT BEHIND.

01:47.411 --> 01:48.847
NOW THAT I KNOW
WHO YOU ARE,

01:48.891 --> 01:52.024
I KNOW WHO I CAN HURT
ONE BY ONE.

01:52.068 --> 01:54.026
HA HA HA!

02:12.175 --> 02:13.263
IT'S ALL MY FAULT.

02:13.307 --> 02:14.569
WE WILL GET THIS
CLEANED UP

02:14.612 --> 02:17.398
AS SOON AS WE FIND MARQUIS.

02:17.441 --> 02:19.574
I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT THE CLINIC.

02:24.970 --> 02:26.755
I HELPED PAMELA
DO THIS.

02:26.798 --> 02:28.670
I KILLED THAT MAN.

02:28.713 --> 02:30.454
I TOLD MARQUIS
WHO YOU WERE.

02:33.892 --> 02:36.112
IT'S OK.

02:36.156 --> 02:37.983
NO, IT'S NOT.

02:38.027 --> 02:40.551
HE CAN TELL EVERYONE
WHO YOU ARE.

02:40.595 --> 02:43.206
I'VE PUT ALL OF OUR
LIVES IN DANGER,

02:43.250 --> 02:46.470
SO HOW MANY MORE
PEOPLE ARE GONNA GET
HURT BECAUSE OF ME?

02:46.514 --> 02:49.125
NO. NO!

02:49.169 --> 02:51.823
THAT WASN'T YOU.
THAT WAS THE INFECTION.

02:51.867 --> 02:53.651
YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

02:53.695 --> 02:55.871
LISTEN TO ME.

02:55.914 --> 02:58.961
YOU ARE DR. MARY HAMILTON.

02:59.004 --> 03:02.660
YOU HAVE SAVED
SO MANY LIVES, MARY.

03:04.923 --> 03:07.187
BUT WHAT ABOUT MARQUIS?

03:07.230 --> 03:10.494
HOW ARE WE GONNA
STOP HIM?

03:10.538 --> 03:12.366
WE ARE GONNA GET
THAT JOY BUZZER FIXED

03:12.409 --> 03:16.065
AND UNDO THE DAMAGE
THE JOKER DID TO HIM.

03:16.108 --> 03:17.893
THIS THING SPENT
13 YEARS IN CRYO FREEZE

03:17.936 --> 03:19.764
AND THEN GOT CHUCKED
INTO THE GOTHAM RIVER.

03:19.808 --> 03:21.549
PRETTY SURE WE VOIDED
THE WARRANTY.

03:21.592 --> 03:23.203
- SO YOU CAN'T FIX IT?
- NO.

03:23.246 --> 03:24.682
I MEAN, MY DAD WOULD HAVE
STUDIED THIS THING

03:24.726 --> 03:26.118
AFTER BATMAN TOOK DOWN
THE JOKER,

03:26.162 --> 03:27.598
BUT MAYBE IF WE HAD
MY DAD'S AI

03:27.642 --> 03:30.688
WE COULD GET SOME ANSWERS.

03:30.732 --> 03:33.517
UH, MARY...

03:33.561 --> 03:35.476
ANY IDEA WHERE IT IS?

03:37.260 --> 03:40.132
THE NIGHT OF THE PARTY,
I GAVE IT TO MARQUIS.

03:42.047 --> 03:44.920
I WANTED TO HURT YOU
IN THE WORST POSSIBLE WAY.

03:46.878 --> 03:48.576
I'M SO SORRY, LUKE.

03:51.187 --> 03:53.972
YEAH. IT'S O--IT'S OK.
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

03:54.016 --> 03:57.454
I KNOW WHO
CAN FIX YOUR
LITTLE BUZZER.

03:57.498 --> 03:59.717
THE PERSON WHO
ORIGINALLY BUILT IT.

04:02.764 --> 04:05.070
MEET KIKI ROULETTE,
THE JOKER'S TOY MAKER.

04:05.114 --> 04:07.116
HER DELIGHTFUL
CREATIONS INCLUDE

04:07.159 --> 04:08.857
THE JOKER'S ACID FLOWER,

04:08.900 --> 04:10.467
HIS INFAMOUS
SMILEY FACE
NERVE GAS BOMB,

04:10.511 --> 04:12.600
AND, UH, THAT LITTLE
TRINKET RIGHT THERE.

04:12.643 --> 04:14.166
SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE
A REAL FAN.

04:14.210 --> 04:15.864
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH ADMIRING

04:15.907 --> 04:17.735
SOMEONE WHO TAKES
PRIDE IN HER WORK.

04:17.779 --> 04:19.302
THERE IS IF HER WORK
KILLED PEOPLE,

04:19.346 --> 04:21.304
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE.

04:21.348 --> 04:22.784
- OK. SO HOW DO WE FIND HER?
- WELL, THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

04:22.827 --> 04:23.959
WHEN THE JOKER WA--

04:29.791 --> 04:31.532
WHEN THE JOKER WAS
APPREHENDED BY BATMAN,

04:31.575 --> 04:33.098
KIKI EVADED CAPTURE
AND DISAPPEARED.

04:33.142 --> 04:34.709
CAN YOU ACCESS
HER MEDICAL RECORDS?

04:34.752 --> 04:36.276
THAT'S SOME PRETTY
INTENSE EYEWEAR,

04:36.319 --> 04:38.974
PROBABLY A VERY
SPECIFIC PRESCRIPTION.

04:39.017 --> 04:41.019
GOOD CALL.
RARE PRESCRIPTION INDEED.

04:41.063 --> 04:44.109
FACTORING IN
DETERIORATION OF AGE,

04:44.153 --> 04:45.720
YEAH, OK.

04:45.763 --> 04:47.199
GOT A POSSIBLE MATCH
IN DRESCHER

04:47.243 --> 04:48.418
FOR A KATHLEEN ROGERS.

04:48.462 --> 04:49.985
COULD BE AN ALIAS.

04:50.028 --> 04:51.465
YEAH. I MEAN, THIS
MIGHT BE OUR GIRL.

04:51.508 --> 04:52.814
THE ADDRESS IS
FOR A HALFWAY HOUSE.

04:52.857 --> 04:54.337
- OK. I'M ON IT.
- NO.

04:54.381 --> 04:57.035
I'LL GO.

04:57.079 --> 04:59.168
YOU SHOULD FOCUS
ON MARQUIS.

05:00.517 --> 05:02.606
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
ENLISTING THE HELP

05:02.650 --> 05:03.955
OF AN EMOTIONALLY UNSTABLE
TERRORIST

05:03.999 --> 05:05.392
TO REPAIR FRONTAL LOBE DAMAGE

05:05.435 --> 05:06.871
WITH A CHILDREN'S TOY.

05:06.915 --> 05:09.831
A DOCTOR SHOULD PROBABLY
BE INVOLVED.

05:13.269 --> 05:15.184
ALICE, GO WITH HER.

05:15.227 --> 05:16.707
OH. UH, WHY ME?

05:16.751 --> 05:18.361
YEAH. WHY HER?

05:18.405 --> 05:19.841
BECAUSE AS FAR
AS MARQUIS KNOWS,

05:19.884 --> 05:21.364
ALICE AND MARY ARE
STILL BATENEMIES,

05:21.408 --> 05:23.540
WHICH MEANS HE WON'T
BE TARGETING THEM.

05:23.584 --> 05:25.499
YOU TWO, ON THE OTHER HAND,
ARE STILL IN HIS CROSSHAIRS.

05:25.542 --> 05:27.022
I'M SORRY.
CAN WE JUST GO BACK
TO THE PART

05:27.065 --> 05:28.545
ABOUT NOT BEING
A BATENEMY?

05:28.589 --> 05:30.025
I'M CONFUSED.

05:30.068 --> 05:31.679
OK. SO WHAT ARE
WE SUPPOSED TO DO?

05:31.722 --> 05:33.507
LAY LOW WHILE I TRY
TO TRACK DOWN MARQUIS.

05:40.514 --> 05:42.907
HEY. I GOT
A BETTER IDEA.

05:42.951 --> 05:44.561
WHY DON'T WE JUST
TELL MARQUIS

05:44.605 --> 05:45.954
I KISSED YOU
AND YOU PUSHED
ME AWAY?

05:45.997 --> 05:47.216
THEN I'LL BE
IN THE CLEAR, RIGHT?

05:47.259 --> 05:48.652
I DIDN'T PUSH
YOU AWAY.

05:48.696 --> 05:50.262
THEN WHAT IS IT
YOU THINK YOU DID?

05:50.306 --> 05:52.439
I DON'T KNOW. I...

05:52.482 --> 05:53.657
WE HAVE BIGGER PROBLEMS.

05:53.701 --> 05:55.442
IS THAT WHAT WE ARE,
A PROBLEM?

05:55.485 --> 05:56.747
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

05:56.791 --> 05:58.270
ACTUALLY, THAT'S
THE WHOLE POINT.

05:58.314 --> 06:00.142
I DON'T KNOW,
AND YOU WON'T TELL ME.

06:02.579 --> 06:06.409
I FEEL LIKE...

06:06.453 --> 06:09.891
WE NEED TO FOCUS
ON KEEPING GOTHAM SAFE.

06:09.934 --> 06:12.459
WE CAN WAIT FOR US.

06:16.201 --> 06:18.029
SORRY. AM I
INTERRUPTING?

06:18.073 --> 06:20.423
- NO.
- YES.

06:20.467 --> 06:22.512
I WAS JUST ABOUT TO
SUIT UP TO FIND MARQUIS.

06:22.556 --> 06:24.819
WELL, YOU'RE NOT
GONNA HAVE TO LOOK
VERY FAR.

06:24.862 --> 06:26.603
HE'S ON EVERY CHANNEL.

06:32.261 --> 06:33.915
THE BUILDINGS
YOU SEE BEHIND ME

06:33.958 --> 06:35.960
ARE WHERE ALL
OF THE INSANITY IN GOTHAM

06:36.004 --> 06:39.399
IS SUPPOSED TO BE LOCKED UP
SAFELY AND AWAY FORM THE PUBLIC,

06:39.442 --> 06:42.793
BUT I'M HERE TO TELL YOU
THE REAL INSANITY

06:42.837 --> 06:44.534
IS OUT THERE,

06:44.578 --> 06:46.580
AND IT'S DRESSED UP
LIKE A BAT.

06:46.623 --> 06:48.277
WHAT DOES IT SAY
ABOUT OUR CITY

06:48.320 --> 06:50.497
THAT ITS SUPPOSED PROTECTOR
IS SIGNIFIED

06:50.540 --> 06:53.935
BY A RABID BLOODSUCKER
WHO MOVES IN THE SHADOWS,

06:53.978 --> 06:55.240
HIDDEN FROM THE EYES
OF THE PUBLIC,

06:55.284 --> 06:57.242
AND ANY ACCOUNTABILITY?

06:57.286 --> 07:00.202
HOW MANY PEOPLE
HAVE TO KEEP PAYING THE PRICE

07:00.245 --> 07:02.422
FOR BATWOMAN'S INSANITY?

07:03.988 --> 07:06.121
SHOULDN'T THE CITY
AT LEAST KNOW HER NAME?

07:12.257 --> 07:15.086
BUT IF BATWOMAN WON'T
TAKE RESPONSIBILITY,

07:15.130 --> 07:16.827
I GUESS I'LL HAVE TO.

07:16.871 --> 07:19.700
SOMEBODY HAS TO RESTORE
THE SANITY TO GOTHAM.

07:19.743 --> 07:23.138
THAT'S WHY AS CEO
OF WAYNE ENTERPRISES,

07:23.181 --> 07:25.314
I'VE ENTERED INTO A PARTNERSHIP
WITH THE CITY,

07:25.357 --> 07:27.577
AND I WILL POUR MILLIONS
OF DOLLARS

07:27.621 --> 07:29.710
INTO IMPROVING
THIS NOTORIOUS ASYLUM

07:29.753 --> 07:32.974
SO THAT THE TRULY ILL AMONG US
LIKE BATWOMAN

07:33.017 --> 07:36.325
CAN AT LAST HAVE
THE PROFESSIONAL HELP

07:36.368 --> 07:38.545
THEY SO DESPERATELY NEED.

07:44.420 --> 07:45.856
MR. JET,
WHAT EXACTLY ARE YOUR PLANS

07:45.900 --> 07:47.597
FOR IMPROVING MENTAL HEALTH
IN GOTHAM, AND ARE YOU...

07:47.641 --> 07:49.164
GOT TO BE HONEST.
THAT'S NOT THE WAY

07:49.207 --> 07:50.687
I THOUGHT MARQUIS WOULD
BE LED INTO ARKHAM.

07:50.731 --> 07:52.515
I THOUGHT HIM TAKING OVER
WAYNE WAS BAD,

07:52.559 --> 07:54.169
BUT WHATEVER HE'S GOT PLANNED
FOR ARKHAM CAN'T BE GOOD.

07:54.212 --> 07:56.345
I DON'T GET IT.
HE HAD ALL

07:56.388 --> 07:58.303
OF GOTHAM WATCHING,
AND HE COULD HAVE
OUTED ME AS BATWOMAN.

07:58.347 --> 08:00.915
I MEAN, I WOULD
HAVE BEEN SO EASY
TO DESTROY ME.

08:00.958 --> 08:02.525
MAYBE YOU'RE NOT
HIS TARGET.

08:02.569 --> 08:03.961
MAYBE THE THING HE WANTS
TO DESTROY IS

08:04.005 --> 08:05.702
THE SYMBOL
OF THE BAT ITSELF.

08:05.746 --> 08:07.704
I DON'T KNOW.
I CAN'T HELP
BUT TO THINK

08:07.748 --> 08:09.097
THERE'S
ANOTHER REASON.

08:09.140 --> 08:10.707
WELL, WHATEVER IT IS,
IT'S GOT MARQUIS

08:10.751 --> 08:12.492
PRESENTING HIMSELF TO GOTHAM
AS SOME KIND OF HERO.

08:12.535 --> 08:14.058
WE NEED TO EXPOSE HIM
FOR WHAT HE REALLY IS.

08:14.102 --> 08:16.017
BECAUSE APPARENTLY
THE PURPLE HAIR

08:16.060 --> 08:17.453
AND JOKER COUTURE WAS
TOO SUBTLE?

08:17.497 --> 08:18.585
HE KILLED
A WAYNE SECURITY GUARD,

08:18.628 --> 08:20.064
DOCTORS AT JETURIAN.

08:20.108 --> 08:21.588
I MEAN, THERE'S GOT
TO BE VIDEO.

08:21.631 --> 08:22.763
- HE SCRUBBED ALL THAT.
- THERE MUST BE

08:22.806 --> 08:25.374
SOME PROOF SOMEWHERE.

08:25.417 --> 08:27.550
YEAH...AND I THINK

08:27.594 --> 08:29.247
JADA'S SITTING ON IT.

08:29.291 --> 08:30.945
SHE TOLD ME SHE HAD
SOMETHING OVER MARQUIS,

08:30.988 --> 08:32.947
SOME KIND OF LEVERAGE
THAT KEPT HER SAFE.

08:32.990 --> 08:35.906
IF IT'S BAD ENOUGH
TO PROTECT JADA,

08:35.950 --> 08:38.082
MAYBE IT'S GOOD
ENOUGH TO PROTECT
THE CITY.

08:44.219 --> 08:46.961
MR. JET, I APPRECIATE
YOUR GENEROUS DONATION
TO ARKHAM,

08:47.004 --> 08:48.789
BUT I DO HAVE
SOME CONCERNS

08:48.832 --> 08:51.400
ABOUT YOUR PLANS
FOR A WORK RELEASE PROGRAM.

08:51.443 --> 08:55.578
I SEE IT AS MORE
OF A COMPASSIONATE
NON-CONFINEMENT.

08:55.622 --> 08:59.451
MR. JET, THESE ARE
DANGEROUS CRIMINALS.

08:59.495 --> 09:02.237
YOU THINK LOCKING
THEM UP MAKES THEM
ANY LESS DANGEROUS?

09:02.280 --> 09:04.239
HOW ELSE DO YOU
EXPECT A CAGED ANIMAL
TO BEHAVE?

09:04.282 --> 09:06.763
WE'RE NOT TALKING
ABOUT STRAY DOGS HERE.

09:06.807 --> 09:08.765
AND YET THAT'S
EXACTLY HOW YOU'RE
TREATING THEM.

09:10.941 --> 09:13.335
THESE ARE SADISTIC
RAPISTS, MR. JET,

09:13.378 --> 09:16.251
SERIAL MURDERERS,
THE WORST OF THE WORST.

09:19.341 --> 09:20.734
GOOD.

09:22.736 --> 09:24.912
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHO I WANT TO MEET.

09:44.932 --> 09:46.411
VICTOR ZSASZ.

09:48.762 --> 09:51.634
LIKE THE HAIR.

09:51.678 --> 09:53.723
I'VE BEEN THINKING
OF GROWING MINE OUT.

09:53.767 --> 09:55.812
HEH. MARQUIS JET.

09:55.856 --> 09:57.553
BIG FAN OF YOUR WORK.

09:57.597 --> 10:00.556
HEH. WELL, THEN WE HAVE
SOMETHING IN COMMON.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.602
I'M A FAN
OF MY WORK, AS WELL.

10:05.256 --> 10:06.910
SO IT'S TRUE.
YOU MARK

10:06.954 --> 10:10.392
EACH OF YOUR KILLS
WITH A SCAR.

10:10.435 --> 10:12.394
CONSIDER MY BODY
MY RESUME.

10:12.437 --> 10:14.439
WELL, FROM THE LOOK
OF IT,

10:14.483 --> 10:16.398
YOU'RE PROBABLY
ALREADY COLLECTING
YOUR PENSION, HUH?

10:16.441 --> 10:19.140
HEH. THERE'S ALWAYS ROOM
FOR A FEW MORE.

10:19.183 --> 10:22.230
AHH. I WAS HOPING
YOU'D SAY THAT.

10:22.273 --> 10:23.623
HEH HEH HEH.

10:32.283 --> 10:35.286
LOOKS LIKE THE PLACE.

10:35.330 --> 10:37.637
DOES IT EVER GET EASIER,

10:37.680 --> 10:40.291
LIVING WITH THE THINGS
YOU'VE DONE?

10:40.335 --> 10:42.685
AND DON'T SAY
IT'S NOT MY FAULT.

10:42.729 --> 10:44.861
OH, THAT'S WHAT
THE BATTEAM'S
BEEN TELLING YOU?

10:44.905 --> 10:47.342
YEAH. THAT'S PROBABLY
BECAUSE THEY THINK YOU'RE
TOO EMOTIONALLY FRAGILE

10:47.385 --> 10:49.300
TO HANDLE THE TRUTH.

10:49.344 --> 10:51.128
WHICH IS?

10:51.172 --> 10:52.826
IT'S TOTALLY YOUR FAULT.

10:52.869 --> 10:54.958
THAT HUNTER DIDN'T
VINE HURL HIMSELF
INTO THE TREE,

10:55.002 --> 10:56.438
AND DYEING YOUR HAIR
BACK TO ITS NATURAL COLOR

10:56.481 --> 10:58.266
DOESN'T CHANGE THAT.

10:59.963 --> 11:02.966
SO--SO WHAT DO
I DO NOW?

11:03.010 --> 11:06.796
EASY. YOU TAKE ALL
OF YOUR FEELINGS,

11:06.840 --> 11:10.191
AND YOU BURY THEM
DEEP DOWN INSIDE,

11:10.234 --> 11:12.715
AND YOU COVER THEM UP
WITH A LAYER

11:12.759 --> 11:14.282
OF "PEOPLE DIE
ALL THE TIME,"

11:14.325 --> 11:16.240
AND THEN YOU
SPRINKLE ON SOME

11:16.284 --> 11:18.678
"HE PROBABLY DID
BAD STUFF, TOO,"

11:18.721 --> 11:20.767
AND THEN YOU PACK
IT DOWN

11:20.810 --> 11:24.161
WITH A NICE LITTLE BIT
OF "HE MIGHT HAVE
EVEN DESERVED IT,"

11:24.205 --> 11:27.382
AND THEN, POOF,
ALL THOSE ICKY,
NO-GOOD FEELINGS

11:27.425 --> 11:28.949
GO BYE-BYE!

11:28.992 --> 11:30.428
AT LEAST THAT'S
WHAT I'D DO.

11:32.692 --> 11:37.000
BUT...I'M NOT
A SOCIOPATH.

11:48.969 --> 11:50.927
AMBER, I'M NOT
THE ONE RESTRICTING YOUR CURFEW.

11:50.971 --> 11:54.017
YOU ARE. PRIVILEGE COMES
WITH ITS RESPONSIBILITIES.

11:54.061 --> 11:57.368
NOW GO--GO SEE IF YOU CAN
HELP OUT IN THE KITCHEN.

11:57.412 --> 11:59.196
- HI.
- HELLO.

11:59.240 --> 12:01.242
WE'RE LOOKING FOR ONE
OF YOUR RESIDENTS--

12:01.285 --> 12:02.983
KIKI ROULETTE.

12:03.026 --> 12:05.463
MIGHT BE GOING
BY KATHLEEN ROGERS.

12:05.507 --> 12:07.465
YEAH. KIKI.

12:07.509 --> 12:09.250
SHE LET OUR CARE
SOME TIME AGO.

12:09.293 --> 12:10.947
IT WASN'T A GOOD FIT.

12:10.991 --> 12:12.819
WELL, DO YOU
KNOW WHERE SHE WENT?

12:12.862 --> 12:14.908
HONESTLY, WE WERE
JUST HAPPY TO
SEE HER GO,

12:14.951 --> 12:17.693
NOT THAT WE DON'T
WISH HER THE BEST.

12:17.737 --> 12:20.478
UH...UH, OK.

12:20.522 --> 12:22.698
WELL, THANKS ANYWAY.

12:22.742 --> 12:24.004
SORRY TO BOTHER YOU.

12:26.136 --> 12:29.400
ACTUALLY, WE DO
MEAN TO BOTHER YOU.

12:29.444 --> 12:33.622
CRAZY KNOWS CRAZY...
KIKI.

12:35.450 --> 12:37.060
IT'S KATHLEEN NOW.

12:45.765 --> 12:48.593
UH, WHAT
ARE YOU DOING?

12:48.637 --> 12:50.160
MARQUIS HAS MY DAD'S AI.

12:50.204 --> 12:52.119
IF HE'S BUSY PLAYING
MAYOR OF CRAZY TOWN,

12:52.162 --> 12:54.338
NOW'S MY BEST CHANCE
TO GET IT.

12:54.382 --> 12:56.819
IF YOU'RE BREAKING
INTO WAYNE TOWER,
I'M GOING WITH YOU.

12:56.863 --> 12:59.126
NOPE. SORRY.
YOU'RE STAYING PUT.

12:59.169 --> 13:00.867
I'M NOT GONNA BE
RESPONSIBLE FOR PUTTING

13:00.910 --> 13:02.694
WHATEVER YOU ARE
TO RYAN IN DANGER.

13:02.738 --> 13:05.436
HEH. WE KISSED.
IT'S NOT IMPORTANT.

13:05.480 --> 13:07.090
SURE ABOUT THAT?

13:09.701 --> 13:12.879
FINE. I KISSED HER.

13:12.922 --> 13:15.577
I THOUGHT SHE WAS INTO IT,
BUT THEN SHE BLOWS ME OFF.

13:15.620 --> 13:17.231
THEN SHE TRIES TO ORDER ME
TO STAND DOWN

13:17.274 --> 13:18.667
LIKE I'M SOME
POINT ROCK PLEBE

13:18.710 --> 13:20.234
WHEN I'M THE ONLY ONE
ON THE BATTEAM

13:20.277 --> 13:22.584
WITH AN ACTUAL CERTIFICATION
IN SPECIAL WEAPONS

13:22.627 --> 13:23.846
AND TACTICS.

13:26.066 --> 13:28.285
YOU SHOULD
BE ABLE TO HANDLE
THE LINE LAUNCHER.

13:37.991 --> 13:39.644
SAW MARQUIS
ON THE TV.

13:39.688 --> 13:41.255
SEEMS LIKE HE
HATES BATWOMAN

13:41.298 --> 13:43.126
ALMOST AS MUCH AS YOU DO.

13:43.170 --> 13:45.215
BATWOMAN SHOULDN'T
HAVE PROVOKED HIM.

13:45.259 --> 13:47.565
FIRST SHE ABDUCTS HIM,
AND THEN SHE LOSES HIM.

13:47.609 --> 13:49.350
NO WONDER IT SENT
HIM OVER THE EDGE.

13:49.393 --> 13:52.614
I DON'T THINK HE NEEDED
MUCH OF A PUSH,

13:52.657 --> 13:55.922
BUT YOU DON'T SEEM
CONCERNED ABOUT
BEING A TARGET.

13:55.965 --> 13:58.750
WE HAVE
AN ARRANGEMENT.

13:58.794 --> 14:01.449
DOES THIS ARRANGEMENT
HAVE ANYTHING TO DO

14:01.492 --> 14:05.235
WITH YOUR VIDEOS
OF MARQUIS' MISDEEDS?

14:05.279 --> 14:08.412
HIS FATHER DIED UNDER
PRETTY MYSTERIOUS
CIRCUMSTANCES.

14:08.456 --> 14:10.588
I BET YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING
IN THAT LIBRARY

14:10.632 --> 14:13.069
THAT COULD SOLVE
THAT LITTLE WHODUNIT.

14:21.686 --> 14:23.079
AND WHAT IF I DID?

14:23.123 --> 14:25.560
THEN YOU NEED TO
USE IT NOW.

14:25.603 --> 14:27.649
TURN IT OVER
TO THE AUTHORITIES.

14:27.692 --> 14:29.520
STOP PROTECTING HIM.

14:29.564 --> 14:31.914
EVERYTHING YOU HAVE BEEN
AFRAID OF ALL THESE YEARS

14:31.958 --> 14:33.568
IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN.

14:33.611 --> 14:35.352
IF YOU THINK MARQUIS
IS GONNA LET YOUR HOME VIDEOS

14:35.396 --> 14:37.050
GET IN THE WAY
OF HIS REVENGE,

14:37.093 --> 14:38.790
YOU DON'T KNOW YOUR SON.

14:40.662 --> 14:42.620
EXCUSE ME.
MS. JET,

14:42.664 --> 14:44.057
THERE'S A MAN HERE
TO SEE YOU.

14:44.100 --> 14:45.275
HE DOESN'T HAVE
AN APPOINTMENT.

14:46.537 --> 14:47.930
OH, MY GOD.

14:50.019 --> 14:52.804
BUT HE DOES HAVE A GUN.

14:52.848 --> 14:55.764
I PROMISE, MS. JET,
I WON'T TAKE UP
MUCH OF YOUR TIME

14:55.807 --> 14:57.548
FRANKLY BECAUSE

14:57.592 --> 14:59.420
YOU DON'T HAVE
MUCH OF IT LEFT.

15:02.466 --> 15:05.165
OH. HEY, RYAN. HEH.

15:20.789 --> 15:22.225
I'M ACTUALLY
GLAD THAT WE RAN

15:22.269 --> 15:23.574
INTO EACH OTHER, RYAN,

15:23.618 --> 15:24.967
BECAUSE I GOT TO SAY

15:25.011 --> 15:28.449
YOU HAVE DONE REALLY
WELL FOR YOURSELF.

15:28.492 --> 15:30.625
MUCH APPRECIATED.

15:30.668 --> 15:33.889
UH, I MEANT TO GET
YOU A CONGRATS GIFT

15:33.933 --> 15:37.153
AFTER YOU MADE
WAYNE CEO,

15:37.197 --> 15:38.938
BUT BY THE TIME
I GOT AROUND TO IT,

15:38.981 --> 15:41.027
YOU'D ALREADY BEEN
DISGRACED,

15:41.070 --> 15:42.811
AND IT JUST FELT LIKE
IT'D BE BRINGING UP
A SORE SUBJECT,

15:42.854 --> 15:47.947
BUT HONESTLY, CONGRATS
AND...SORRY.

15:47.990 --> 15:49.949
- YOU KNOW THIS MAN?
- IN ANOTHER LIFE.

15:49.992 --> 15:52.081
LIFE. THANK YOU.

15:52.125 --> 15:54.040
MAN, I WAS
REALLY STRUGGLING
FOR A SEGUE THERE,

15:54.083 --> 15:55.955
AND YOU TOTALLY
BAILED ME OUT.

15:55.998 --> 15:58.044
LIFE, AS IN YOURS,
MS. JET,

15:58.087 --> 15:59.959
IS HANGING
IN THE BALANCE HERE.

16:00.002 --> 16:02.091
YOU GOT THE EVIDENCE
YOU CAME FOR.

16:02.135 --> 16:05.616
HEH. I'M AFRAID
IT'S A LITTLE MORE
COMPLICATED THAN THAT.

16:05.660 --> 16:07.009
OOH!

16:07.053 --> 16:09.055
THEN WHY DON'T I
MAKE IT SIMPLE?

16:09.098 --> 16:12.058
WHATEVER YOU'RE BEING PAID,
I'LL TRIPLE IT.

16:12.101 --> 16:13.929
WELL...

16:13.973 --> 16:16.366
CONSIDERING YOUR SON
HIRED ME,

16:16.410 --> 16:18.978
KILLING YOU JUST LETS
HIM INHERIT MORE MONEY

16:19.021 --> 16:20.849
THAT HE CAN THEN
GIVE TO ME,

16:20.892 --> 16:23.112
SO IT'S REALLY JUST
A WASTE OF OUR TIME,

16:23.156 --> 16:24.548
YOURS ESPECIALLY.

16:28.030 --> 16:31.033
WELL, IF IT'S ME
YOU'RE AFTER,

16:31.077 --> 16:33.514
THEN YOU CAN LET
MY DAUGHTER GO.

16:37.083 --> 16:40.042
WHOA.

16:40.086 --> 16:41.739
DAUGHTER? WAIT.

16:41.783 --> 16:44.786
I THOUGHT YOUR MOM
WAS DEAD, RIGHT?

16:44.829 --> 16:47.397
DEAD MOM NUMBER ONE
DIED IN CHILDBIRTH,

16:47.441 --> 16:49.704
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH,
FOSTER CARE,

16:49.747 --> 16:52.489
AND THEN YOU WERE
ADOPTED BY DEAD MOM
NUMBER TWO.

16:52.533 --> 16:55.666
SO HOW DOES THAT
MAKE HER SOON-TO-BE
DEAD MOM NUMBER 3?

16:55.710 --> 16:57.712
SHE'S NOT.

16:57.755 --> 17:01.020
SHE'S MY BIOLOGICAL MOTHER,
WHO DIDN'T DIE IN CHILDBIRTH.

17:03.065 --> 17:06.068
SO AFTER YEARS
OF SEPARATION,

17:06.112 --> 17:08.201
YOU TWO ACTUALLY
FOUND EACH OTHER

17:08.244 --> 17:11.291
AND RECONNECTED
ONLY TO DISCOVER

17:11.334 --> 17:13.815
THAT DESPITE BEING
APART YOU BOTH STORMED

17:13.858 --> 17:16.035
THE CORPORATE CEO
PATRIARCHY

17:16.078 --> 17:20.865
TO BECOME POWERFUL
TITANS OF BUSINESS?

17:20.909 --> 17:23.259
NOW THAT'S WHAT
I CALL A HAPPY ENDING.

17:23.303 --> 17:24.956
HEH.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.697
EXCEPT FOR THE PART
WHERE I HAVE TO DO

17:26.741 --> 17:28.786
WHAT CHILDBIRTH DIDN'T,

17:28.830 --> 17:32.399
BUT--UH-OH--TWIST!

17:32.442 --> 17:35.489
THERE IS A CHANCE
FOR A LAST-MINUTE RESCUE

17:35.532 --> 17:38.753
BUT ONLY IF BATWOMAN
COMES TO SAVE YOU.

17:38.796 --> 17:40.233
SO HERE'S THE DEAL.

17:40.276 --> 17:44.193
I LEFT A LITTLE NOTE
ON THE BAT-SIGNAL.

17:45.977 --> 17:48.632
THERE IT IS.
APPARENTLY, YOUR SON

17:48.676 --> 17:51.026
WANTS TO GIVE BATWOMAN
A RINGSIDE SEAT TO YOUR DEMISE.

17:51.070 --> 17:53.202
I'M NOT REALLY SURE
WHAT HER DOG IS

17:53.246 --> 17:57.554
IN THIS FIGHT,
BUT LET'S PUT AN HOUR

17:57.598 --> 17:59.643
ON THE CLOCK ANYWAY,

17:59.687 --> 18:01.254
FACTORING IN
GOTHAM RUSH HOUR.

18:01.297 --> 18:02.907
THAT OUGHT TO GIVE
LADY BAT PLENTY OF TIME

18:02.951 --> 18:04.474
TO GET HERE.

18:04.518 --> 18:09.131
OF COURSE, THEN SHE
HAS TO STOP ME. HEH HEH.

18:09.175 --> 18:11.525
THE SUSPENSE MIGHT KILL ME
BEFORE I HAVE TO KILL YOU.

18:11.568 --> 18:17.487
HEH. SO IF YOU TWO HAVE ANY
LAST MOTHER-DAUGHTER THINGS

18:17.531 --> 18:19.272
YOU WANT TO DISCUSS--

18:19.315 --> 18:21.665
FUNERAL ARRANGEMENTS,
PERHAPS--

18:21.709 --> 18:23.537
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME.

18:30.109 --> 18:31.849
WHY WOULD YOU WANT ME
TO FIX THIS THING?

18:31.893 --> 18:34.025
IT'S ALREADY HURT
SO MANY PEOPLE.

18:34.069 --> 18:35.723
BECAUSE WE THINK
WE CAN USE IT TO HELP

18:35.766 --> 18:37.333
THE LAST PERSON
IT HURT.

18:40.467 --> 18:42.251
THE LITTLE BOY
ON THE BUS.

18:42.295 --> 18:43.774
AND THAT LITTLE
CATERPILLAR BLOSSOMED

18:43.818 --> 18:46.516
INTO QUITE
THE PSYCHOTIC BUTTERFLY.

18:46.560 --> 18:49.128
EXACTLY AS THE BUZZER
WAS DESIGNED TO DO.

18:50.955 --> 18:53.001
THE ELECTRICAL IMPULSES
RENDERED THE PART

18:53.044 --> 18:55.090
OF HIS BRAIN CONTROLLING
EMPATHY DORMANT,

18:55.134 --> 18:56.961
FLIPPED IT OFF
LIKE A LIGHT SWITCH.

18:57.005 --> 18:59.442
BUT ANOTHER ZAP
WOULD FLIP IT BACK ON?

18:59.486 --> 19:01.183
IN THEORY, YES.

19:01.227 --> 19:03.011
A JOLT TO
A PSYCHOTIC BRAIN

19:03.054 --> 19:04.795
WOULD REOPEN
THOSE NEURAL PATHWAYS.

19:04.839 --> 19:07.058
- OK. GREAT.
- I'D NEED MY TOOLS TO FIX IT.

19:07.102 --> 19:09.844
THEY'RE ALL BACK
AT THE JOKER'S OLD WORKSHOP.

19:11.541 --> 19:16.894
I'VE WORKED SO HARD TO PUT
ALL OF THIS BEHIND ME.

19:16.938 --> 19:18.505
I DON'T WANT TO GO BACK.

19:18.548 --> 19:20.071
OH, COME ON.

19:20.115 --> 19:21.508
THE ONLY THING YOU DON'T
WANT TO GO BACK TO

19:21.551 --> 19:23.379
IS PRISON,

19:23.423 --> 19:26.208
AND AS SOMEONE
WHO USED TO BE A HUGE FAN

19:26.252 --> 19:28.732
OF YOURS, I SEE RIGHT
THROUGH THAT

19:28.776 --> 19:32.432
12-STEP, SAFE SPACE,
DEN MOTHER ROUTINE.

19:32.475 --> 19:34.521
SO YOU CAN DROP THE ACT.

19:36.175 --> 19:38.133
IT'S NOT AN ACT.

19:38.177 --> 19:40.004
I'VE WORKED FOR OVER
A DECADE AND A HALF

19:40.048 --> 19:43.094
TO FIND WAYS TO MAKE UP
FOR THE DAMAGE I'VE DONE.

19:53.322 --> 19:55.150
WHO KNEW FIXING
THIS AWFUL THING

19:55.194 --> 19:56.630
WOULD BE ONE OF THEM?

20:01.635 --> 20:03.158
YOU SHOULD SAVE
YOURSELF THE TIME

20:03.202 --> 20:04.290
AND JUST SHOOT ME.

20:04.333 --> 20:06.117
BATWOMAN'S NOT COMING.

20:06.161 --> 20:07.554
- YOU THINK?
- I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE BEEN

20:07.597 --> 20:09.338
KEEPING UP
WITH CURRENT EVENTS,

20:09.382 --> 20:11.819
BUT THERE'S A BIT
OF BAD BLOOD BETWEEN ME AND HER.

20:11.862 --> 20:13.255
YOU, TOO? WOW!

20:13.299 --> 20:16.084
WE HAVE SO MUCH
IN COMMON.

20:16.127 --> 20:18.521
I MEAN, I DIDN'T ABANDON
A DAUGHTER TO THIS CITY'S

20:18.565 --> 20:20.915
BRUTALLY UNDERFUNDED
FOSTER SYSTEM

20:20.958 --> 20:24.310
ALL THE WHILE PERCHED
COMFORTABLY ATOP
A BILLION-DOLLAR EMPIRE,

20:24.353 --> 20:26.442
BUT, YOU KNOW,
POTATO, POTAHTO.

20:26.486 --> 20:27.791
I DIDN'T ABANDON HER.

20:29.532 --> 20:32.927
NO. YOU JUST PAID
A DOCTOR $2 MILLION

20:32.970 --> 20:34.755
TO DO IT FOR YOU.

20:34.798 --> 20:38.498
NOW, THIS IS
THE CONTENT I CAME FOR.

20:38.541 --> 20:42.458
THE MONEY WASN'T
TO COVER UP GIVING
BIRTH TO YOU, RYAN.

20:42.502 --> 20:47.202
NO. IT WAS TO COVER UP
YOUR AFFAIR.

20:47.246 --> 20:50.510
IT'S MORE COMPLICATED
THAN THAT.

20:50.553 --> 20:53.339
IT WAS
A DIFFERENT TIME,

20:53.382 --> 20:55.297
AND I WAS
IN A DIFFERENT PLACE.

20:55.341 --> 20:57.430
I WAS LOOKING
AT EVERYTHING THAT
I HAD WORKED FOR

20:57.473 --> 20:59.867
GOING DOWN THE DRAIN,
AND THEN...

20:59.910 --> 21:01.825
THE DOCTOR TOLD ME
ABOUT A COUPLE

21:01.869 --> 21:04.611
WHO WERE DESPERATE
TO HAVE A CHILD
OF THEIR OWN,

21:04.654 --> 21:08.484
AND...I SAW IT
AS AN OPPORTUNITY

21:08.528 --> 21:10.530
TO GIVE YOU
A LOVING HOME.

21:10.573 --> 21:13.620
THE TWO MILLION WAS
SUPPOSED TO GO
TO THE FAMILY

21:13.663 --> 21:16.840
TO ENSURE THAT YOU
WOULD WANT FOR NOTHING.

21:16.884 --> 21:19.800
ALL THOSE YEARS,
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
BEING CARED FOR

21:19.843 --> 21:22.672
BY LOVING PARENTS,
BUT...

21:22.716 --> 21:24.326
IT WAS ONLY
WHEN YOU FOUND ME

21:24.370 --> 21:25.762
THAT I REALIZED
THAT THE DOCTOR

21:25.806 --> 21:27.460
HAD KEPT THE MONEY
FOR HIMSELF

21:27.503 --> 21:29.679
AND DROPPED YOU OFF
AT A FIRE STATION.

21:32.508 --> 21:34.902
WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL ME EARLIER?

21:34.945 --> 21:37.339
BECAUSE I WAS TRYING
TO PUSH YOU AWAY

21:37.383 --> 21:39.515
TO PROTECT YOU
FROM MARQUIS.

21:44.433 --> 21:49.308
BUT...CLEARLY I FAILED
ON ALL FRONTS.

21:54.138 --> 21:57.881
I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU
BOTH FOR LETTING ME

21:57.925 --> 22:01.798
BE A PART OF THIS
SPECIAL MOMENT. TRULY.

22:01.842 --> 22:03.060
THANK YOU.

22:05.193 --> 22:07.282
BUT...

22:07.326 --> 22:11.591
IT SEEMS BATWOMAN
IS A NO-SHOW,

22:11.634 --> 22:14.463
AND I'M AFRAID
A DEADLINE IS A DEADLINE.

22:14.507 --> 22:16.813
IT'S A VERY VIOLENT WORD
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT,

22:16.857 --> 22:20.164
BUT ENTIRELY APPROPRIATE
TO THIS MOMENT.

22:20.208 --> 22:23.994
RYAN...ANY LAST WORDS
FOR MS. JET?

22:24.038 --> 22:25.344
YEAH.

22:27.346 --> 22:28.608
MOM...

22:31.350 --> 22:32.786
DUCK.

22:32.829 --> 22:34.048
AGH!

22:50.847 --> 22:52.283
UNH!

22:58.464 --> 22:59.900
MY GOD.

23:02.685 --> 23:04.861
THAT'S WHY BATWOMAN
DIDN'T SHOW UP.

23:06.733 --> 23:09.083
SHE WAS HERE
THE WHOLE TIME.

24:04.181 --> 24:05.966
ANYTHING I CAN DO
TO HELP?

24:06.009 --> 24:08.359
YES. KEEP HER
FROM TOUCHING THAT.

24:08.403 --> 24:11.450
I REMEMBER YOU,
TALKY TEDDY.

24:11.493 --> 24:15.889
OHH! OH, YOU WERE
THE HOTTEST TOY OF THE HOLIDAYS.

24:15.932 --> 24:18.979
EVERY KID IN CLASS
WANTED ONE.

24:19.022 --> 24:20.894
LITTLE DID THEY KNOW
KIKI OVER HERE

24:20.937 --> 24:23.200
HAD ATTACHED THE PULL CORD
TO THE PIN

24:23.244 --> 24:26.116
OF A FRAGMENTATION GRENADE
HIDDEN INSIDE.

24:27.727 --> 24:28.989
HOW MANY PEOPLE
WERE...

24:29.032 --> 24:30.207
KILLED?

24:30.251 --> 24:33.123
5. 2 ADULTS, 3 CHILDREN.

24:33.167 --> 24:37.432
ANOTHER 12 SUFFERED
PERMANENT INJURIES.

24:37.476 --> 24:39.826
HOW DO YOU MOVE ON
FROM THAT?

24:39.869 --> 24:42.306
YOU DON'T.

24:42.350 --> 24:45.179
YOU LIVE WITH IT
EVERY DAY.

24:45.222 --> 24:47.355
AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT
MY THERAPIST SPENT YEARS

24:47.398 --> 24:49.270
TRYING TO
GET THROUGH TO ME.

24:58.148 --> 25:00.760
I HAD ALL THE EXCUSES.

25:00.803 --> 25:03.371
IT WASN'T ME.
THE JOKER MADE ME DO IT.

25:03.414 --> 25:05.852
THERE'S NO ESCAPE FROM ALL
THE PAIN THAT I CAUSED.

25:05.895 --> 25:07.723
MY MIND STARTED TO PLAY
TRICKS ON ME.

25:07.767 --> 25:11.292
I WOULD SEE MY VICTIMS
EVERYWHERE.

25:11.335 --> 25:13.381
WHAT DID YOU DO
TO MAKE IT STOP?

25:15.775 --> 25:17.907
ONCE I REACHED
MY BREAKING POINT,

25:17.951 --> 25:20.562
MY THERAPIST INSISTED THAT
I HAD TO DO THE HARD WORK,

25:20.606 --> 25:22.695
THAT I NEEDED TO ACCEPT
RESPONSIBILITY

25:22.738 --> 25:24.697
FOR EVERYTHING
THAT I'D DONE.

25:24.740 --> 25:26.699
THE PEOPLE I HURT CAN'T
FORGET WHAT I DID TO THEM,

25:26.742 --> 25:30.267
SO...HOW CAN I?

25:41.540 --> 25:43.672
NICE LANDING.
RYAN WOULD BE IMPRESSED.

25:43.716 --> 25:46.588
HEH. NOT THAT SHE'D
EVER SHOW IT.

25:46.632 --> 25:49.983
SHE'S JUST SO HARD
TO READ SOMETIMES.

25:50.026 --> 25:51.985
YOU KNOW, ONE MINUTE,

25:52.028 --> 25:53.508
I THINK SHE'S INTO ME.

25:53.552 --> 25:55.031
THE NEXT MINUTE,
SHE'S SHUTTING ME OUT.

25:55.075 --> 25:56.293
AND YOU THOUGHT
PULLING HER IN
FOR A KISS

25:56.337 --> 25:57.730
WOULD CLEAR THINGS UP?

25:59.645 --> 26:01.211
CAMERAS DEACTIVATED.

26:09.698 --> 26:11.352
HONESTLY,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
I WAS THINKING.

26:11.395 --> 26:13.180
I DO. PRETTY SURE
I KNOW YOUR TYPE.

26:13.223 --> 26:15.182
HEY. FOR THE RECORD...

26:15.225 --> 26:17.837
I WAS INTO RYAN
LONG BEFORE I KNEW
SHE WAS BATWOMAN.

26:17.880 --> 26:20.579
EXACTLY HOW LONG...
FOR THE RECORD?

26:22.842 --> 26:24.626
NOT IMPORTANT.

26:24.670 --> 26:26.759
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

26:26.802 --> 26:28.935
YOU HAD A CRUSH ON RYAN
BACK WHEN YOU THOUGHT
SHE WAS A CRIMINAL?

26:28.978 --> 26:30.632
WE'RE DONE TALKING
ABOUT THIS.

26:30.676 --> 26:31.981
I'M NOT.

26:35.855 --> 26:37.508
PRETTY SURE YOU ARE.

26:45.125 --> 26:47.040
DAD, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

26:47.083 --> 26:49.042
BEEN A WHILE, SON.

26:49.085 --> 26:51.044
YEAH. BELIEVE ME.
I KNOW.

26:51.087 --> 26:52.480
I'M TAKING YOU HOME.

26:52.523 --> 26:54.003
HOLD UP.

26:54.047 --> 26:57.528
WE'VE GOT ACCESS TO
MARQUIS' LAPTOP.

26:57.572 --> 27:01.184
WE'D BE CRAZY IF WE
DIDN'T TAKE A PEEK
UNDER THE HOOD.

27:01.228 --> 27:03.883
DAD, WANT TO HELP US
HACK A LAPTOP?

27:07.234 --> 27:08.888
I KNOW A GUY
IN MY PROFESSION'S

27:08.931 --> 27:11.542
NOT SUPPOSED TO DEVELOP
FEELINGS FOR HIS TARGETS,

27:11.586 --> 27:14.633
BUT YOU TWO REALLY
BULL'S-EYED ME RIGHT HERE.

27:25.252 --> 27:27.254
SO WHERE DO WE GO
FROM HERE?

27:30.692 --> 27:33.782
WELL...BASED
ON RECENT HISTORY,

27:33.826 --> 27:37.960
YOU CALL DANA DEWITT
WITH YOUR LATEST SCOOP
OUTING ME AS BATWOMAN.

27:39.875 --> 27:41.224
I WOULDN'T DO THAT
TO YOU.

27:41.268 --> 27:43.139
YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

27:43.183 --> 27:45.272
EVER SINCE WE'VE MET,

27:45.315 --> 27:49.450
ALL YOU'VE DONE
IS TAKE AWAY ANYTHING
GOOD IN MY LIFE.

27:49.493 --> 27:53.193
YOU CAME AFTER ME
AS CEO OF WAYNE,

27:53.236 --> 27:55.674
AND YOU CAME AFTER ME
AS BATWOMAN,

27:55.717 --> 27:57.676
AND YOU THINK
SOME SOB STORY ABOUT HOW

27:57.719 --> 27:59.068
YOU TRIED TO GIVE ME
$2 MILLION

27:59.112 --> 28:01.549
WOULD MAKE
A DAMN DIFFERENCE.

28:01.592 --> 28:03.812
DID YOU EVER WONDER
WHERE I WAS,

28:03.856 --> 28:05.335
HOW I WAS DOING?

28:05.379 --> 28:06.772
DID YOU EVER EVEN
THINK ABOUT ME?

28:06.815 --> 28:08.687
OF COURSE I THOUGHT
ABOUT YOU.

28:08.730 --> 28:10.732
YEAH.

28:10.776 --> 28:13.169
JUST NOT ENOUGH
TO CHECK UP ON ME.

28:15.302 --> 28:17.217
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT
I WOULD HAVE WANTED

28:17.260 --> 28:19.959
INSTEAD OF $2 MILLION?

28:20.002 --> 28:23.353
A MOM WHO CARED ENOUGH
TO MAKE SURE I WAS
IN GOOD HANDS,

28:23.397 --> 28:26.530
THAT I HAD SOMEONE
TO WALK ME TO SCHOOL

28:26.574 --> 28:28.228
MY FIRST DAY
OF KINDERGARTEN,

28:28.271 --> 28:30.621
SOMEONE TO MAKE ME
CUPCAKES FOR MY BIRTHDAY,

28:30.665 --> 28:33.015
SOMEONE TO YELL AT ME
FOR STAYING UP TOO LATE

28:33.059 --> 28:34.321
WATCHING TV,

28:34.364 --> 28:36.279
BUT I HAD TO WAIT
14 YEARS

28:36.323 --> 28:38.151
FOR ANY OF THAT!

28:41.197 --> 28:42.677
YOU'RE RIGHT.

28:48.814 --> 28:50.772
AND LOOK AT YOU--

28:50.816 --> 28:52.948
THE CHILD I GAVE
NOTHING TO,

28:52.992 --> 28:55.298
AND YOU ACHIEVED
ALL OF THIS.

28:55.342 --> 28:58.127
I GAVE MARQUIS EVERYTHING...

28:59.650 --> 29:01.522
AND LOOK
HOW HE TURNED OUT.

29:01.565 --> 29:05.395
MAYBE THE GREATEST THING
I EVER DID FOR YOU

29:05.439 --> 29:07.789
WAS STAYING OUT
OF YOUR LIFE.

29:17.756 --> 29:20.193
RYAN, MARQUIS
IS USING ARKHAM INMATES

29:20.236 --> 29:22.021
AS HIS OWN
PERSONAL SECURITY FORCE,

29:22.064 --> 29:23.805
AND HE'S SICCING ZSASZ
ON YOU AND JADA.

29:23.849 --> 29:25.807
YEAH. I ALREADY
DEALT WITH HIM,

29:25.851 --> 29:27.374
BUT HOW DO YOU
KNOW THAT?

29:30.029 --> 29:31.682
LUKE AND I HACKED
INTO HIS COMPUTER

29:31.726 --> 29:33.293
AFTER WE BROKE
INTO WAYNE TOWER.

29:33.336 --> 29:35.817
YOU WHAT? I TOLD YOU
TO LAY LOW.

29:35.861 --> 29:38.167
AND I DIDN'T LISTEN
BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE TO.

29:38.211 --> 29:40.517
YOU'RE NOT MY KEEPER,
AND YOU'RE NOT MY...

29:40.561 --> 29:42.258
ANYTHING.

29:42.302 --> 29:44.217
NO. JUST SOMEONE
TRYING TO KEEP YOU SAFE.

29:44.260 --> 29:46.175
FIGHT ABOUT IT LATER.
WE GOT BIGGER PROBLEMS.

29:46.219 --> 29:48.177
ACCORDING TO HIS CALL LOG,
MARQUIS HAS BEEN IN CONTACT

29:48.221 --> 29:49.744
WITH KIKI ROULETTE.

29:55.619 --> 29:57.186
YOU GOT IT
WORKING AGAIN?

29:57.230 --> 29:59.667
YES, BUT THE CIRCUIT BOARD'S
SO CORRODED

29:59.710 --> 30:01.756
BUZZER'S ONLY GOT
ONE ZAP LEFT IN IT,

30:01.800 --> 30:03.714
AND THAT'S THE GOOD NEWS.

30:03.758 --> 30:06.282
WHICH SEEMS TO IMPLY
THERE'S BAD NEWS.

30:08.415 --> 30:11.461
HEH HEH HEH HEH!

30:11.505 --> 30:14.160
OH, IT'S BAD.
IT'S REALLY BAD

30:14.203 --> 30:15.857
BECAUSE, YOU SEE,

30:15.901 --> 30:18.077
NOW THAT THIS THING'S
WORKING AGAIN,

30:18.120 --> 30:22.124
I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH LONGER
MARQUIS NEEDS YOU ALIVE ANYMORE.

30:22.168 --> 30:26.563
HEH HEH HA HA HA!

30:26.607 --> 30:27.695
RIGHT BACK AT YOU.

30:29.131 --> 30:31.133
HA HA HA HA!

30:31.177 --> 30:32.874
I PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE
EXPECTED THAT.

30:37.705 --> 30:39.315
AND THAT.

30:39.359 --> 30:42.884
HA HA HA HA HA HA!

30:47.367 --> 30:49.021
MARY'S NOT PICKING UP.

30:49.064 --> 30:50.849
SOPHIE'S SENDING YOU
THE GPS LOCATION
OF HER PHONE.

30:50.892 --> 30:52.546
- BATWING OUT.
- LET'S GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE.

30:52.589 --> 30:54.591
ONE SECOND. I WANT
TO CLONE THE HARD DRIVE.

30:54.635 --> 30:56.593
IF I KNEW YOU WERE
GONNA BE SNOOPING,

30:56.637 --> 30:58.900
I'D HAVE CLEARED
MY BROWSER HISTORY.

30:58.944 --> 31:01.337
HA HA HA HA HA HA!

31:06.386 --> 31:08.388
SO EVERYTHING YOU SAID
YOUR THERAPIST TOLD YOU

31:08.431 --> 31:11.826
ABOUT HEALING,
DOING ALL THE HARD WORK,
THOSE WERE ALL LIES?

31:11.870 --> 31:13.393
OH, NO, NO, NO.
THAT WAS ALL TRUE.

31:13.436 --> 31:15.003
I JUST DIDN'T
WANT TO DO IT.

31:15.047 --> 31:16.962
IN MY DEFENSE, THOUGH,
MY THERAPIST

31:17.005 --> 31:19.616
WAS HARLEEN QUINZEL,
SO, YOU KNOW.

31:19.660 --> 31:21.880
HA HA HA!

31:21.923 --> 31:24.491
KIKS, HOW'S MY
FAVORITE TOY MAKER DOING?

31:24.534 --> 31:26.841
HAPPY TO BE DEALT
BACK INTO THE GAME.

31:26.885 --> 31:28.669
WELL, YOU CAN THANK
YOUR FORMER ARKHAM CELL MATE

31:28.712 --> 31:30.801
FOR CONNECTING US,
AND I CAN THANK YOU

31:30.845 --> 31:32.368
FOR GETTING ME
THE JOY BUZZER.

31:32.412 --> 31:35.197
YEAH. ABOUT THAT.
THERE'S NOT MUCH JOY LEFT.

31:35.241 --> 31:37.025
CIRCUITRY'S SHOT.
YOU GOT ONE BUZZ.

31:37.069 --> 31:39.201
GOOD!

31:39.245 --> 31:40.855
THAT'S ALL I NEED.

31:43.292 --> 31:46.730
OH, HOO HOO HOO
HOO HOO!

31:46.774 --> 31:50.517
BOSS, YOU BETTER
TAKE THIS.

31:50.560 --> 31:52.345
YOUR PLAN TO MAKE ME
WITNESS JADA'S DEATH

31:52.388 --> 31:54.086
DIDN'T WORK OUT.

31:54.129 --> 31:57.002
WELL, IF SOMEBODY
NEEDED A WIN,
IT WAS YOU.

31:57.045 --> 31:59.352
YOU KNOW, HONESTLY
WITH ALL THE BAD PRESS
YOU'RE GETTING,

31:59.395 --> 32:02.790
I'M SHOCKED THAT YOU
EVEN WANTED TO SHOW
YOUR FACE IN PUBLIC.

32:02.833 --> 32:04.879
HOW ABOUT I GIVE THEM
A NAME TO GO WITH IT, HMM?

32:04.923 --> 32:06.837
WHAT DO YOU THINK
THEY'LL SAY THEN?

32:06.881 --> 32:08.535
NOT A DAMN THING
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT
GONNA TELL THEM.

32:08.578 --> 32:10.841
- OH. YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?
- YEAH. YOU ARE, TOO.

32:10.885 --> 32:12.408
BECAUSE THE MOMENT
YOU SAY MY NAME,

32:12.452 --> 32:13.932
ALL OF GOTHAM
WILL KNOW HOW MUCH

32:13.975 --> 32:15.846
I ACCOMPLISHED
WITH NOTHING,

32:15.890 --> 32:18.066
AND HOW LITTLE
YOU ACCOMPLISHED
WITH EVERYTHING.

32:19.720 --> 32:21.113
WELL, YOU GOT ME THERE,

32:21.156 --> 32:22.853
BUT YOU KNOW
WHAT I'VE GOT?

32:22.897 --> 32:24.812
YOUR FRIENDS,
NOT TO MENTION

32:24.855 --> 32:28.076
YOUR SIDEKICK
AND YOUR SIDE PIECE.

32:30.122 --> 32:31.514
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

32:31.558 --> 32:33.168
TO DO WHAT I PROMISED,

32:33.212 --> 32:37.303
TO HURT THE PEOPLE
YOU CARE ABOUT ONE BY ONE.

32:37.346 --> 32:38.782
NOW, HOW DO YOU
WANT TO DO THIS?

32:38.826 --> 32:40.697
YOU, UH--YOU WANT TO
DO IT ALPHABETICALLY,

32:40.741 --> 32:42.482
BY BIRTHDAY,

32:42.525 --> 32:43.962
BY HEIGHT?

32:48.488 --> 32:50.359
HEY, BATWOMAN.
REMEMBER WHEN I TOLD YOU

32:50.403 --> 32:52.013
I COULD TAKE CARE
OF MYSELF?

32:52.057 --> 32:53.449
I MEANT IT.

32:53.493 --> 32:54.711
UNH!

33:23.871 --> 33:25.742
AGH! AGH!

33:28.136 --> 33:29.920
AGH! OHH!

33:52.204 --> 33:53.727
THAT'S QUITE
AN ENTRANCE.

33:53.770 --> 33:56.208
DON'T GET ALL
IMPRESSED JUST YET.

33:56.251 --> 33:57.557
I LOST THE BUZZER.

33:57.600 --> 33:59.907
MARQUIS HAS IT NOW.

33:59.950 --> 34:02.257
I JUST WANTED YOU
TO KNOW SO YOU CAN
BE READY.

34:02.301 --> 34:05.304
THERE'S NO TELLING
WHAT HE HAS PLANNED.

34:05.347 --> 34:07.697
I'M SORRY I WASN'T
ABLE TO STOP HIM.

34:11.005 --> 34:13.616
I'M PRETTY SURE I'M
THE ONE WHO SHOULD
BE SAYING THAT.

34:15.227 --> 34:19.057
I FAILED HIM JUST LIKE
I FAILED YOU.

34:28.501 --> 34:31.895
I COULDN'T ACKNOWLEDGE
THE LOVE THAT I HAD FOR YOU,

34:31.939 --> 34:33.636
SO I SIGNED A CHECK,

34:33.680 --> 34:35.943
AND I HOPED
FOR THE BEST,

34:35.986 --> 34:38.641
BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN
THAT I DIDN'T LOVE YOU

34:38.685 --> 34:44.169
OR THAT I DIDN'T
CONSIDER YOU A PART OF ME.

34:44.212 --> 34:47.607
I NAMED YOU AFTER
MY OWN FATHER,

34:47.650 --> 34:51.524
AND I DID THINK
ABOUT YOU EVERY DAY,

34:51.567 --> 34:53.134
BUT I HAD TO BURY
THOSE FEELINGS,

34:53.178 --> 34:54.875
OR THEY WOULD HAVE
CRUSHED ME,

34:54.918 --> 34:57.617
WHICH IS CLEARLY WHAT I DO
WHEN I DON'T WANT TO GET HURT.

34:57.660 --> 34:59.880
I PUT UP A WALL.

34:59.923 --> 35:01.969
SO THAT'S WHERE I
GET THAT FROM.

35:05.364 --> 35:07.409
THAT'S MY LIFE, RYAN.

35:07.453 --> 35:09.107
DON'T LET IT
BE YOURS.

35:13.198 --> 35:16.810
ALL RIGHT.
DIAGNOSTIC COMPLETE.

35:16.853 --> 35:18.725
LOOKS LIKE YOU SURVIVED
A NIGHTMARE ROAD TRIP

35:18.768 --> 35:20.335
AND A STINT
WITH A JOKER FAN BOY.

35:20.379 --> 35:21.771
THANKS TO YOU, SON.

35:21.815 --> 35:24.209
I SEE YOU DECIDED TO
WEAR THE SUIT AGAIN.

35:24.252 --> 35:27.125
- YEAH. SORRY ABOUT THAT.
- DON'T BE.

35:27.168 --> 35:29.953
OH, GOOD.
BECAUSE I'M NOT.

35:29.997 --> 35:32.086
IT TOOK ME A WHILE,
BUT I FINALLY REALIZED

35:32.130 --> 35:34.349
THAT I WAS JUST USING
THE SUIT TO PROTECT MYSELF

35:34.393 --> 35:36.177
FROM THE THINGS THAT
I DIDN'T WANT TO FACE.

35:36.221 --> 35:37.961
SO YOU FIGURED OUT
YOU DIDN'T NEED
THE SUIT

35:38.005 --> 35:39.398
TO BE A HERO.

35:39.441 --> 35:41.487
I KNEW YOU'D GET
THERE, LUCAS.

35:41.530 --> 35:43.010
THANKS, DAD.

35:44.707 --> 35:46.448
BUT YOU COULDN'T HAVE
TOLD ME THAT SOONER?

35:46.492 --> 35:48.189
ANY OTHER THOUGHTS
YOU'D LIKE TO SHARE?

35:48.233 --> 35:50.191
- JUST ONE.
- MM-HMM?

35:50.235 --> 35:51.975
I'M PROUD OF YOU.

36:02.464 --> 36:06.338
HEH HEH HA HA HA!

36:06.381 --> 36:08.078
AHH.

36:24.834 --> 36:28.055
THEY SAY YOU SHOULD
NEVER MEET YOUR HEROES.

36:28.098 --> 36:31.101
WHAT DO THEY SAY
ABOUT MEETING YOUR VILLAINS?

36:33.974 --> 36:36.542
I'M SURE THEY'LL SAY
WE MAKE A GREAT TEAM.

36:38.370 --> 36:40.546
AND WITH ONE BUZZ LEFT,

36:40.589 --> 36:42.896
WHO'S GONNA GET
THE LAST LAUGH?

36:44.724 --> 36:45.899
HEH HEH HEH!

36:45.942 --> 36:47.814
HA HA HA!

37:04.222 --> 37:07.964
ALICE?

37:08.008 --> 37:11.533
IT'S ME.
YOU CAN COME OUT NOW.

37:11.577 --> 37:13.231
I'M ALONE.

37:15.798 --> 37:17.800
WHAT'S WITH ALL
THE BLACK?

37:17.844 --> 37:19.628
WHERE DID YOU
COME FROM?

37:21.587 --> 37:24.720
IT'S ACTUALLY
FOR WHERE I'M GOING,

37:24.764 --> 37:26.505
THE WAKE
FOR THE HUNTER.

37:28.028 --> 37:30.683
THE MAN THAT I KILLED.

37:30.726 --> 37:32.075
OH, MY GOODNESS.

37:32.119 --> 37:33.512
THAT TOUCHY FEELY
TERRORIST REALLY DID

37:33.555 --> 37:35.209
A NUMBER ON YOU,
DIDN'T SHE?

37:35.253 --> 37:36.993
PLEASE TELL ME YOU'RE
NOT TAKING LIFE ADVICE

37:37.037 --> 37:38.604
FROM A WOMAN WHO PUTS
HAND GRENADES

37:38.647 --> 37:39.953
IN TEDDY BEAR TUMMIES.

37:39.996 --> 37:41.563
IT DOESN'T MEAN
THAT SHE'S WRONG.

37:41.607 --> 37:44.000
NO. IT MEANS SHE
COCOONED EXPLOSIVES

37:44.044 --> 37:45.872
INSIDE FUZZY SYMBOLS
OF KINDNESS

37:45.915 --> 37:49.136
THAT CHILDREN
INSTINCTIVELY
WANT TO HUG.

37:49.179 --> 37:51.225
AND IF I DON'T
TAKE RESPONSIBILITY

37:51.269 --> 37:52.922
FOR ALL OF THE PAIN
THAT I'VE CAUSED

37:52.966 --> 37:54.663
AND DO THE HARD WORK
TO MAKE AMENDS,

37:54.707 --> 37:56.970
THEN I AM NO DIFFERENT
THAN HER.

37:57.013 --> 37:59.015
KIKI REALLY SENT YOU
ON A GUILT TRIP, HUH?

37:59.059 --> 38:02.671
OH, AND LOOK. SHE EVEN
PACKED YOU A BAG.

38:02.715 --> 38:06.936
ACTUALLY, THIS IS
FOR YOU.

38:06.980 --> 38:09.548
WITH YOUR IMMUNITY DEAL
GONE BYE-BYE,

38:09.591 --> 38:13.900
I PACKED AS MUCH
OF YOUR STUFF
AS I COULD FIT.

38:13.943 --> 38:15.467
THERE'S CASH
IN HERE, TOO,

38:15.510 --> 38:17.251
ENOUGH TO GET YOU
FAR AWAY FROM HERE.

38:19.340 --> 38:21.995
YEAH. UM...

38:22.038 --> 38:23.997
I CAN'T LEAVE
GOTHAM JUST YET.

38:25.825 --> 38:28.131
WHAT POSSIBLE REASON
DO YOU HAVE TO STAY?

38:28.175 --> 38:30.612
EVERYONE'S HUNTING
YOU, ALICE.

38:30.656 --> 38:32.048
I KNOW, BUT, UH...

38:34.137 --> 38:36.183
WHAT IF I WASN'T
ALICE?

38:38.490 --> 38:41.493
I DON'T WANT TO BE
HER ANYMORE.

38:41.536 --> 38:45.235
I DON'T WANT
TO BE A SOCIOPATH.

38:45.279 --> 38:48.151
OH, MY GOSH.

38:48.195 --> 38:51.633
THIS IS HUGE.

38:51.677 --> 38:54.810
I CAN HELP YOU.

38:54.854 --> 38:57.204
I WAS HOPING
YOU'D SAY THAT

38:57.247 --> 38:59.075
BECAUSE I'M NOT
REALLY THE KIND OF GAL

38:59.119 --> 39:01.295
WHO LIKES TO DO
THE HARD WORK.

39:01.339 --> 39:02.992
THEN WHAT DO YOU WANT?

39:03.036 --> 39:05.081
THE JOY BUZZER.

39:05.125 --> 39:07.649
WE NEED THE BUZZER
FOR MARQUIS.

39:09.390 --> 39:12.567
BUT YOU HAVE
A SISTER

39:12.611 --> 39:14.395
WHO NEEDS IT MORE.

39:22.229 --> 39:24.449
LOOK. IF YOU BROUGHT ME
DOWN HERE TO LECTURE ME,

39:24.492 --> 39:26.625
I DON'T TELL YOU
WHEN TO BE BATWOMAN,

39:26.668 --> 39:29.105
AND YOU CAN'T TELL ME
WHAT I CAN AND CAN'T DO.

39:29.149 --> 39:31.107
- I'M NOT YOUR SIDEKICK.
- IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT.

39:31.151 --> 39:32.848
WELL, THEN IF IT'S
ABOUT YOU WANTING
TO PROTECT ME,

39:32.892 --> 39:34.502
I'M NOT YOUR DAMSEL
TO RESCUE.

39:34.546 --> 39:38.550
I KNOW. IT'S NOT
ABOUT THAT EITHER.

39:38.593 --> 39:40.639
THEN WHAT IS IT
ABOUT?

39:47.254 --> 39:49.387
IT'S ABOUT ME BEING
REAL WITH YOU.

39:53.086 --> 39:55.131
I KEEP PEOPLE
AT ARM'S LENGTH.

39:55.175 --> 39:57.307
I LOST A LOT OF PEOPLE
IN MY LIFE,

39:57.351 --> 40:00.572
AND I AM SCARED TO DEATH
TO LOSE ANYONE ELSE,

40:00.615 --> 40:02.835
SO I DON'T LET
PEOPLE IN,

40:02.878 --> 40:04.532
AND THE WHOLE
SUPERHERO THING

40:04.576 --> 40:07.056
GIVES ME AN EXCUSE
TO KEEP DOING THAT.

40:11.060 --> 40:14.063
I GET IT.

40:14.107 --> 40:17.371
I WON'T PUSH.

40:17.415 --> 40:19.242
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

40:55.540 --> 40:57.585
I'LL BUY YOU
A NEW ONE.

40:57.629 --> 40:59.761
- I HATE THAT THING.
- MM-HMM.

41:16.299 --> 41:17.866
YEAH.

42:08.482 --> 42:10.484
GREG, MOVE YOUR HEAD.
