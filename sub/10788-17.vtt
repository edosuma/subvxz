WEBVTT

00:07.667 --> 00:11.291
JOEY POTTER.
JUST THE GIRL
I'M LOOKING FOR.

00:11.291 --> 00:13.917
YOU REALLY HAVE THAT
FIRST NAME, LAST NAME
THING DOWN, DON'T YOU?

00:13.917 --> 00:15.708
DOES THAT HELP YOU
KEEP THE LADIES STRAIGHT?

00:15.708 --> 00:16.834
WELL, YOU KNOW,
I DON'T WANT
TO CONFUSE

00:16.834 --> 00:18.583
JOEY FROM
WORTHINGTON WITH
JOEY FROM AMHERST.

00:18.583 --> 00:19.750
OH, I PASSED HER
ON THE STREET ONCE.

00:19.750 --> 00:20.708
DIDN'T LIKE
THE LOOKS OF HER.

00:20.708 --> 00:22.041
FUNNY, SINCE SHE'S
GOT NOTHING ON YOU.

00:22.041 --> 00:23.500
YOU KNOW, NOW REALLY
ISN'T A PRIME TIME

00:23.500 --> 00:24.708
FOR
THE OBNOXIOUS BANTER,

00:24.708 --> 00:26.333
SO IF THE SCARY STALKING PART
OF THE EVENING IS OVER--

00:26.333 --> 00:27.458
MOVE IT ALONG,
RIGHT, YEAH, OK.

00:27.458 --> 00:29.000
I NEED YOU.

00:29.000 --> 00:30.417
PLEASE SAY THIS ISN'T
WHEN YOU BURST INTO

00:30.417 --> 00:31.625
YOU'VE LOST
THAT LOVING FEELING.

00:31.625 --> 00:33.041
NO, BUT, YOU KNOW,
FUNNY YOU SHOULD
MENTION

00:33.041 --> 00:34.458
BURSTING INTO SONG.

00:34.458 --> 00:37.500
I THOUGHT WE AGREED
TO NEVER SPEAK
OF THAT NIGHT AGAIN.

00:37.500 --> 00:39.000
I THOUGHT
YOU JUST MEANT
THE KISSING PART.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.500
THERE YOU ARE,
SPEAKING OF IT.

00:41.500 --> 00:42.583
OK, LISTEN, LISTEN.

00:42.583 --> 00:44.458
WE'RE DOING
A GIG UPSTATE
THIS WEEKEND.

00:44.458 --> 00:45.250
5 SONGS,
OPENING ACT,

00:45.250 --> 00:48.041
IT'S AN INCREDIBLY
BIG DEAL.

00:48.041 --> 00:50.125
WE'RE EVEN GETTING
PAID. 500 BUCKS.

00:50.125 --> 00:53.041
WOW, THAT'S A MONTH'S
WORTH OF HAIR GEL.

00:53.041 --> 00:54.875
OHH.

00:54.875 --> 00:56.041
LOOK,
THIS IS KIND OF
OUR FIRST BIG BREAK,

00:56.041 --> 00:58.458
EXCEPT FOR THE
LEAD SINGER QUIT.

00:58.458 --> 00:59.917
HMM. COULDN'T HANDLE
THE BASS PLAYER
WITH MYSTIQUE

00:59.917 --> 01:02.041
GETTING ALL THE GIRLS?

01:02.041 --> 01:02.917
NO, THESE DAYS
THERE'S REALLY
ONLY ONE I WANT.

01:02.917 --> 01:06.125
OHH. CHARLIE,
I'M FLATTERED,

01:06.125 --> 01:09.458
REALLY, IN A KIND OF
OBLIGATORY WAY, BUT--

01:09.458 --> 01:10.708
I NEED YOU TO SING.

01:10.708 --> 01:13.166
EXCUSE ME?

01:13.166 --> 01:15.000
I COME TO YOU WITH
OPEN ARMS, JOEY,

01:15.000 --> 01:18.291
PURELY A GUY
ASKING A GIRL

01:18.291 --> 01:19.875
A FAVOR.

01:19.875 --> 01:23.041
YOU REALLY TRUST ME
TO FRONT YOUR BAND?

01:23.041 --> 01:25.917
ABSOLUTELY. DOES THIS
MEAN YOU'LL DO IT?

01:25.917 --> 01:27.083
I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.

01:27.083 --> 01:29.291
YOU'RE TOTALLY GONNA
DO IT, AREN'T YOU?

01:31.583 --> 01:34.917
HERE'S THE SET LIST.

01:34.917 --> 01:36.083
OK, I SAID
I'D THINK ABOUT IT,

01:36.083 --> 01:37.291
AND THE LONGER WE STAND
HERE, THE LONGER I HAVE

01:37.291 --> 01:38.875
TO THINK ABOUT YOU
AND THE 10,000 REASONS

01:38.875 --> 01:39.834
WHY I DON'T
WANT TO DO THIS.

01:39.834 --> 01:41.375
THANK YOU.

02:41.291 --> 02:43.750
MMM, YEAH, YOU KNOW,

02:43.750 --> 02:45.583
THIS IS REALLY HOT
AND EVERYTHING,

02:45.583 --> 02:46.708
BUT THE THRILL
OF KNOWING

02:46.708 --> 02:48.041
THAT JOEY
COULD WALK IN
THE DOOR ANY MINUTE

02:48.041 --> 02:49.500
IS KIND OF
WEARING OFF.

02:49.500 --> 02:52.708
AND HERE YOU TOLD ME YOU
DIDN'T HAVE ANY FANTASIES.

02:52.708 --> 02:54.458
YOU KNOW
WHAT I MEAN, PACEY.

02:54.458 --> 02:55.375
ACTUALLY, I DON'T.
THERE'S NOT A LOT OF BLOOD

02:55.375 --> 02:57.500
RUNNING THROUGH
MY BRAIN RIGHT NOW.

02:57.500 --> 02:58.750
WELL, THESE MAKE-OUT
SESSIONS USED TO BE

02:58.750 --> 02:59.542
VERY OLD-SCHOOL
CHARMING,

02:59.542 --> 03:01.667
BUT NOW
IT'S QUICKLY MOVING

03:01.667 --> 03:03.125
INTO THE REALM
OF SLUTDOM.

03:03.125 --> 03:03.875
YOUR CAR,
MY DORM ROOM,

03:03.875 --> 03:07.208
THE COED BATHROOM.

03:07.208 --> 03:09.458
A LADY MUST BE
COURTED, PACEY.

03:09.458 --> 03:11.333
SO, THAT'S IT, THEN?

03:11.333 --> 03:13.083
WE'RE HAVING THAT TALK,
AREN'T WE?

03:13.083 --> 03:15.792
YOU NEED TO GET
AN APARTMENT.

03:15.792 --> 03:17.250
IS THAT IT?

03:17.250 --> 03:18.834
AND HERE I THOUGHT
YOU WERE DUMPING ME.

03:18.834 --> 03:19.917
MMM! WHAT'S TO DUMP?

03:19.917 --> 03:22.125
I'M NOT HOLDING YOU BACK
FROM ANYTHING, SPORT.

03:22.125 --> 03:22.792
YOU KNOW, FLY OUT INTO
THE WORLD, MY BUTTERFLY,

03:22.792 --> 03:24.834
BE FREE.

03:24.834 --> 03:25.792
DO I HAVE TO?

03:25.792 --> 03:29.500
NO. YOU JUST HAVE
TO GET AN APARTMENT.

03:29.500 --> 03:31.750
SERIOUSLY,
I AM FEELING...

03:31.750 --> 03:33.000
ALL KINDS OF
INHIBITED RIGHT NOW.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.542
THIS IS YOU INHIBITED?

03:35.542 --> 03:36.166
YEAH, I MEAN,
I CAN'T REALLY

03:36.166 --> 03:38.583
LET MY FREAK FLAG FLY

03:38.583 --> 03:39.667
WITH ALL THOSE WARNINGS
FROM MY R.A.

03:39.667 --> 03:43.291
THEN I DEFINITELY
HAVE TO GET AN APARTMENT.

03:47.166 --> 03:49.125
MMM. I GOTTA GO.

03:49.125 --> 03:52.250
OK. WELL, WHATEVER.
CALL ME

03:52.250 --> 03:53.875
FROM WHEREVER YOU'RE
SQUATTING TONIGHT.

03:53.875 --> 03:56.208
WILL DO. ALL RIGHT.

03:56.208 --> 03:56.792
POTTER.

03:56.792 --> 03:58.792
WITTER.

04:00.583 --> 04:01.750
HEY, BEFORE I FORGET,
GUESS WHO CALLED?

04:01.750 --> 04:04.041
UM--

04:04.041 --> 04:05.333
NO, FORGET IT.
YOU SUCK AT THIS GAME.

04:05.333 --> 04:06.834
CHARLIE CALLED.

04:06.834 --> 04:09.625
HE CALLED AGAIN?
PERSISTENT.

04:09.625 --> 04:11.125
SO, ARE WE GOING?

04:11.125 --> 04:12.083
HE TOLD YOU?

04:12.083 --> 04:15.041
I AM VERY ENGAGING
ON THE PHONE, JOEY,

04:15.041 --> 04:16.250
AND YOU'RE KIDDING ME
IF YOU'RE TELLING ME

04:16.250 --> 04:18.416
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
DO THIS GIG.

04:18.416 --> 04:20.458
IT WAS KIND OF FUN
AT THE BAR, BUT--

04:20.458 --> 04:22.583
KIND OF FUN?
COME ON, I MEAN,

04:22.583 --> 04:23.708
IT WAS VERGING
ON EMBARRASSING.

04:23.708 --> 04:25.125
I PRACTICALLY HAD TO
DRAG YOU OFF THE STAGE,

04:25.125 --> 04:27.333
YOU'RE SUCH
A MEDIA WHORE.

04:27.333 --> 04:30.083
NO, BUT THE THING
IS TONIGHT.

04:30.083 --> 04:31.417
I MEAN, THAT MEANS

04:31.417 --> 04:32.667
WE'D HAVE TO LEAVE,
LIKE--

04:32.667 --> 04:33.708
IN AN HOUR, I KNOW.

04:33.708 --> 04:35.000
CHARLIE AND I HAVE IT
UNDER CONTROL.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.125
WELL, I'M NOT
RIDING IN THE VAN

04:36.125 --> 04:37.667
WITH HIS GAGGLE OF
QUESTIONABLE GUITARISTS.

04:37.667 --> 04:41.250
JUST RELAX AND CONCENTRATE
ON YOUR HEROIN CHIC THING.

04:41.250 --> 04:42.959
IT JUST SO HAPPENS I KNOW
A GUY WITH SOME WHEELS.

04:42.959 --> 04:44.458
WHAT'S WITH THIS
CHARLIE PETITION?

04:44.458 --> 04:45.291
HE'S SMARMY.

04:45.291 --> 04:48.250
OK, LET'S JUST
BE HONEST HERE.

04:48.250 --> 04:50.291
I PRETTY MUCH BROUGHT
DOWN THE HOUSE THAT NIGHT,

04:50.291 --> 04:51.375
BUT CHARLIE HAS ASKED
YOU  TO SING.

04:51.375 --> 04:53.792
NOW EITHER HE'S
INTIMIDATED BY MY TALENT,

04:53.792 --> 04:55.792
WHICH IS KIND OF LIKELY,
OR HE'S HOT FOR YOU.

04:55.792 --> 04:56.959
I'LL TAKE THE LATTER,
AND I DON'T THINK

04:56.959 --> 04:58.125
IT'S SUCH
A BAD THING, JOEY.

04:58.125 --> 04:59.291
I MEAN,
IF I DO THIS,

04:59.291 --> 05:01.208
WHICH APPARENTLY
WE'VE DECIDED I AM,

05:01.208 --> 05:02.291
IT'S FOR THE FUN
EXPERIENCE OF IT,

05:02.291 --> 05:05.583
NOT CHARLIE,
JUST TO CLARIFY.

05:05.583 --> 05:06.458
WELL, DULY NOTED.

05:06.458 --> 05:09.959
NOW, LET'S GO PICK OUT
AN OUTFIT.

05:09.959 --> 05:12.708
AND NOT FROM YOUR CLOSET,
OK? FROM MINE.

05:12.708 --> 05:14.458
Dawson: IS IT COMPLETELY
STUPID FOR ME TO GET CLOTHES

05:14.458 --> 05:17.000
FOR MY LITTLE SISTER
FOR HER BIRTHDAY?

05:17.000 --> 05:18.792
NO, I THINK THAT
IT'S GREAT, YOU KNOW.

05:18.792 --> 05:20.458
SHE'S FINALLY DEVELOPING
HER OWN SENSE OF STYLE

05:20.458 --> 05:22.875
AS OPPOSED TO THAT
TYPICAL BLATANT NUDITY.

05:22.875 --> 05:25.417
HEY, SPEAKING OF WHICH...

05:25.417 --> 05:27.375
WHY AM I HAVING
SUCH A HARD TIME

05:27.375 --> 05:28.917
GETTING DRESSED?

05:28.917 --> 05:30.083
WE'RE GOING
TO CAPESIDE

05:30.083 --> 05:31.125
FOR A ONE-YEAR-OLD'S
BIRTHDAY PARTY.

05:31.125 --> 05:32.959
WHO AM I TRYING
TO IMPRESS?

05:32.959 --> 05:34.000
YOU GOT ME.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.959
DO YOU MEAN I GOT YOU
OR YOU'RE STUMPED?

05:35.959 --> 05:38.583
WHAT?

05:39.750 --> 05:41.834
I DON'T KNOW.

05:41.834 --> 05:44.208
GETTING DRESSED.
CARRY ON.

05:44.208 --> 05:45.458
Grams, knocking:
JENNIFER, DAWSON,

05:45.458 --> 05:48.667
I HOPE YOU'RE DECENT
AS I'VE ALREADY ENTERED

05:48.667 --> 05:50.834
THE ROOM, AND I--

05:50.834 --> 05:53.875
OH.

05:53.875 --> 05:57.375
OH, I'M SORRY, I THOUGHT
YOU WERE, UH...

05:59.583 --> 06:01.000
LET'S MOVE ON.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.542
UM, JOEY'S WAITING FOR YOU
AT THE DOOR, DAWSON.

06:03.542 --> 06:05.166
HEH. THANK YOU.

06:05.166 --> 06:06.583
MM-HMM.

06:10.417 --> 06:13.375
WOW, I FEEL REALLY OLD
AND BORING ALL OF A SUDDEN.

06:13.375 --> 06:15.875
WHY? JUST BECAUSE
GRAMS DIDN'T CATCH US

06:15.875 --> 06:17.375
IN A COMPROMISING
POSITION?

06:17.375 --> 06:18.542
YES, EXACTLY.

06:18.542 --> 06:20.375
YOU KNOW, NOT EVERY
MORNING HAS TO BEGIN

06:20.375 --> 06:22.959
WITH AN EMBARRASSING
GRAMS ENCOUNTER.

06:22.959 --> 06:24.708
I KNOW, I KNOW.

06:24.708 --> 06:26.959
WE SHOULD GO,

06:26.959 --> 06:29.583
UNLESS YOU WANT TO, UH...

06:29.583 --> 06:32.708
I DO, AND I WOULD,

06:32.708 --> 06:34.375
BUT I FINALLY
JUST GOT DRESSED.

06:34.375 --> 06:35.708
I'M JUST
NOT IN THE MOOD

06:35.708 --> 06:36.208
TO BE SEPARATED
FROM MY OUTFIT

06:36.208 --> 06:38.125
AT THIS POINT.

06:38.125 --> 06:40.208
OK.

06:40.208 --> 06:42.333
THAT WAS EASY.

06:42.333 --> 06:43.458
EXCUSE ME?

06:43.458 --> 06:46.375
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED
TO WANT TO HAVE SEX WITH ME

06:46.375 --> 06:47.667
AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY?

06:47.667 --> 06:48.708
I PRETTY MUCH DO.

06:48.708 --> 06:50.583
YOU JUST SAID
YOU'RE NOT IN THE MOOD.

06:50.583 --> 06:51.542
AND YOU'VE BEEN CRANKY
ALL MORNING,

06:51.542 --> 06:52.875
WHICH KIND OF MAKES ME
NOT IN THE MOOD,

06:52.875 --> 06:54.417
SO BEFORE
THIS LITTLE FIGHT
YOU'RE TRYING TO PICK

06:54.417 --> 06:55.708
BECOMES FODDER
FOR YOUR RADIO SHOW,

06:55.708 --> 06:58.417
I'M JUST GONNA GO
DOWNSTAIRS AND ANSWER
THE DOOR.

06:58.417 --> 07:00.417
SMART-ASS.

07:01.291 --> 07:03.708
ARE YOU OK?
SERIOUSLY.

07:06.917 --> 07:08.917
YEAH. YEAH, DAWSON,
I'M FINE.

07:08.917 --> 07:11.291
OK.

07:11.291 --> 07:13.250
OK.

07:20.708 --> 07:23.000
PERFECT TIMING. WE'RE
LEAVING IN 10 MINUTES.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.875
OH. WELL,
ACTUALLY, DAWSON,

07:25.875 --> 07:26.959
I CAME BY TO TELL YOU

07:26.959 --> 07:28.083
THAT I'M NOT GONNA BE
ABLE TO MAKE IT AT ALL.

07:28.083 --> 07:29.875
OH, SOMETHING COME UP?

07:29.875 --> 07:32.333
KIND OF.

07:32.333 --> 07:33.792
IT'S A LONG STORY,

07:33.792 --> 07:36.417
AND--WELL, I'M--
I'M GOING UPSTATE

07:36.417 --> 07:38.792
TO SING WITH
CHARLIE'S BAND.

07:38.792 --> 07:41.083
WHEN YOU SAY IT
OUT LOUD, IT SOUNDS
KIND OF CRAZY.

07:41.083 --> 07:42.500
WHAT, CHARLIE CHARLIE?

07:42.500 --> 07:43.708
ONE AND THE SAME.

07:43.708 --> 07:46.291
OK, WELL,
WE'RE GONNA MISS YOU.

07:46.291 --> 07:47.333
WELL, I'LL MISS YOU
MORE THAN LILY,

07:47.333 --> 07:48.542
BUT YOU CAN'T
BLAME THE KID.

07:48.542 --> 07:52.250
SHE'S GOT
A SHORT ATTENTION SPAN.

07:52.250 --> 07:53.500
WELL, CAN YOU GIVE
THIS TO HER FOR ME?

07:53.500 --> 07:55.291
IT'S JUST A LITTLE
SOMETHING. I...

07:55.291 --> 07:57.458
HOPE SHE LIKES IT.

07:57.458 --> 07:59.250
IT'S BRIGHT AND SHINY.
SHE'LL LOVE IT.

07:59.250 --> 08:02.125
HAVE A GREAT TRIP.

08:02.125 --> 08:04.083
YEAH, YOU, TOO.

08:06.834 --> 08:07.959
NOT GONNA BE THE SAME
WITHOUT YOU.

08:07.959 --> 08:10.667
HEH!

08:12.333 --> 08:13.625
BYE.

08:13.625 --> 08:15.250
BYE.

08:18.417 --> 08:21.959
IS THIS A NEW KIND
OF ORANGE JUICE?

08:21.959 --> 08:23.500
MM-HMM. I THINK
IT'S SOME PULP

08:23.500 --> 08:26.250
INSTEAD
OF TONS OF PULP.

08:27.500 --> 08:30.667
INTERESTING.
I THINK I'M GONNA
BREAK UP WITH DAWSON.

08:35.332 --> 08:35.958
YOU READY TO GO?

08:35.958 --> 08:38.500
YEAH.

08:38.500 --> 08:40.250
OK.

08:53.417 --> 08:54.708
WOW.

08:54.708 --> 08:58.875
HAD NO IDEA
YOU WERE THROWING
SUCH A SOIREE.

08:58.875 --> 09:00.041
QUITE A SHINDIG
FOR SOMETHING

09:00.041 --> 09:01.667
LILY WON'T
EVEN REMEMBER.

09:01.667 --> 09:04.500
WELL, I HAVE BEEN
A LITTLE COOPED UP
LATELY.

09:04.500 --> 09:06.333
OOH, LILY'S BIRTHDAY
WAS JUST A NICE EXCUSE

09:06.333 --> 09:07.208
TO GATHER
SOME OLD FRIENDS.

09:07.208 --> 09:09.583
COFFEE'S READY, GALE.

09:13.125 --> 09:15.041
HEY, YOU MUST BE DAWSON.
IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU.

09:15.041 --> 09:17.375
HEY.

09:17.375 --> 09:19.333
Gale: OH, SORRY,
HOW RUDE OF ME.

09:19.333 --> 09:22.750
UM, DAWSON, HONEY,
THIS IS MY FRIEND
NATHAN

09:22.750 --> 09:23.792
AND HIS
DAUGHTER HALEY.

09:23.792 --> 09:24.208
SAY HI.
HI.

09:24.208 --> 09:25.875
HEH HEH!

09:27.875 --> 09:30.750
UH, THIS IS
MY GIRLFRIEND JEN.

09:30.750 --> 09:31.750
HI.

09:31.750 --> 09:32.458
NICE TO MEET YOU.

09:32.458 --> 09:34.542
NICE TO MEET
YOU, TOO.

09:34.542 --> 09:36.708
WELL, UM, I THINK
I HAVE JUST ABOUT
EVERYTHING READY.

09:36.708 --> 09:38.792
EXCEPT, OF COURSE,
I DID FORGET

09:38.792 --> 09:40.291
TO PICK UP THE CAKE
AT THE BAKERY.

09:40.291 --> 09:41.917
YOU KNOW, JEN AND I,
WE CAN DO THAT

09:41.917 --> 09:43.375
FOR YOU, MRS. LEERY,
NO PROBLEM.

09:43.375 --> 09:44.917
YEAH, THAT'S NO
PROBLEM AT ALL.

09:44.917 --> 09:48.917
OH, THANKS, GUYS.
SO, EVELYN, DAWSON,

09:48.917 --> 09:52.417
HOW ABOUT
SOME COFFEE?

09:52.417 --> 09:54.000
BE RIGHT BACK.

09:56.583 --> 09:58.625
WELL, YOU CAN'T
DUMP HIM NOW.

09:58.625 --> 09:59.417
JACK, IT'S NOT FUNNY.

09:59.417 --> 10:01.667
NO, IT'S
NOT FUNNY, JEN,

10:01.667 --> 10:03.000
WHICH IS WHY
WE'RE GOING TO GET
THIS CAKE TOGETHER

10:03.000 --> 10:03.959
SO YOU
CAN FILL ME IN

10:03.959 --> 10:06.750
ON WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON HERE.

10:08.000 --> 10:08.917
GET IN THE CAR.

10:12.250 --> 10:13.083
Pacey: AND YOU'LL
LET ME PICK THE MUSIC?

10:13.083 --> 10:16.291
IF YOU MUST.
IT'LL BE FUN, PACEY.

10:16.291 --> 10:18.083
COME ON!
THERE ARE WORSE WAYS

10:18.083 --> 10:19.041
TO SPEND
YOUR SATURDAY

10:19.041 --> 10:19.792
THAN TRAVELING
THE OPEN ROAD

10:19.792 --> 10:21.667
WITH A COUPLE
OF HOTTIES.

10:21.667 --> 10:22.875
TRUE, THAT. BUT I
STILL DON'T LIKE THE IDEA

10:22.875 --> 10:25.875
OF CATERING TO CHIP MARK
AND HIS MERRY BAND.

10:25.875 --> 10:27.041
CHARLIE TODD.

10:27.041 --> 10:27.834
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW
THE GUY'S ACTUAL NAME.

10:27.834 --> 10:28.625
I JUST DON'T
WANT YOU TO FEEL

10:28.625 --> 10:29.792
OUT OF THE LOOP
OR ANYTHING.

10:29.792 --> 10:31.959
THIS GUY IS NOT EVEN
IN OUR SOCIAL CIRCLE.

10:31.959 --> 10:33.792
I MEAN, SURE,
HE CIRCLES AROUND IT
LIKE A VULTURE,

10:33.792 --> 10:35.291
BUT HE'S NOT ACTUALLY
IN THE CIRCLE,

10:35.291 --> 10:37.542
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

10:37.542 --> 10:39.458
NO, BUT HE IS
RUNNING TOWARDS US
WITH ALARMING SPEED.

10:39.458 --> 10:41.458
OH, YOU GOTTA
BE KIDDING ME.

10:41.458 --> 10:42.959
WHEW! THANK GOD
I FOUND YOU.

10:42.959 --> 10:44.959
THE GUYS LEFT IN THE VAN
AN HOUR AGO.

10:44.959 --> 10:46.917
MAYBE THEY WERE
TRYING TO TELL YOU
SOMETHING.

10:46.917 --> 10:48.291
I OVERSLEPT.

10:48.291 --> 10:50.166
YOU GUYS MIND
IF I CATCH A RIDE?

10:50.166 --> 10:54.208
WELL, I DON'T SEE
ANY REASON WHY YOU CAN'T.

10:54.208 --> 10:56.834
WHAT WAS
YOUR BACKUP PLAN?

10:56.834 --> 10:58.834
YOU KNOW, IF YOU
OVERSLEPT AND YOUR
RIDE FAILED YOU?

10:58.834 --> 11:00.583
WELL, UH,
THIS IS PRETTY MUCH IT.

11:00.583 --> 11:03.125
AND EVEN THAT'S
AN OVERSTATEMENT.

11:03.125 --> 11:04.000
WHAT?

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
NOTHING. PACE,
I KNOW THIS SUCKS,

11:06.000 --> 11:06.834
BUT THERE'S
NOT MUCH THEY CAN
DO WITHOUT HIM,

11:06.834 --> 11:08.875
AND AS LONG
AS WE'RE GOING...

11:11.500 --> 11:13.250
OH, THANK YOU.
YOU GUYS ROCK.

11:13.250 --> 11:14.500
I'M REALLY
SORRY, PACE.

11:14.500 --> 11:15.834
NOBODY PLANNED
ON THIS.

11:15.834 --> 11:19.166
I BEG TO DIFFER.
I'M PRETTY SURE
LAUGHING BOY OVER THERE

11:19.166 --> 11:20.000
PLANNED THIS.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
[WHINING]
"I MISSED MY RIDE."

11:22.000 --> 11:22.834
YOU KNOW THAT THIS GUY
IS JUST STALKING JOEY--

11:22.834 --> 11:25.041
HELLO! PRESENT
LOVE INTEREST

11:25.041 --> 11:26.166
STANDING RIGHT
IN FRONT OF YOU.

11:26.166 --> 11:27.250
IT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH YOU.

11:27.250 --> 11:28.834
I JUST SAW WHAT
THIS GUY DID TO JEN.

11:28.834 --> 11:29.959
I DON'T WANT HIM
TO DO IT

11:29.959 --> 11:31.208
TO ANOTHER ONE
OF MY FRIENDS.

11:31.208 --> 11:33.166
OK, LET'S JUST...

11:33.166 --> 11:34.917
ENJOY THIS
FOR WHAT IT IS--

11:34.917 --> 11:36.291
WACKY ROAD TRIP
HIGH JINX

11:36.291 --> 11:39.000
WITH A MOTLEY CREW
AND THEIR COLLECTIVE
SEXUAL TENSION.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.250
THROW IN
A BAG OF PORK RINDS,

11:40.250 --> 11:41.166
YOU GOT YOURSELF
A DEAL.
OK.

11:41.166 --> 11:43.333
BUT YOU KEEP THIS GUY
AWAY FROM ME.

11:43.333 --> 11:44.250
SERIOUSLY.

11:44.250 --> 11:48.083
HEH HEH!

11:48.083 --> 11:49.667
WHAT?

11:49.667 --> 11:50.750
IT'S JUST...

11:50.750 --> 11:52.875
I THINK
I DREAMT THIS ONCE.

11:52.875 --> 11:54.250
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

11:54.250 --> 11:56.542
YOU, ME,

11:56.542 --> 11:58.542
A BIG BACKSEAT.

11:58.542 --> 11:59.792
THIS BACKSEAT
HAS NO IMPLICATIONS.

11:59.792 --> 12:01.542
HEY, I DIDN'T SAY
THAT IT DID.

12:01.542 --> 12:03.667
THIS IS
STRICTLY BUSINESS.

12:03.667 --> 12:06.625
ALL MY BACKSEAT
TRANSACTIONS ARE.

12:06.625 --> 12:10.291
[CAR DOORS CLOSE]

12:10.291 --> 12:11.959
[ENGINE STARTS]

12:20.834 --> 12:22.917
OH, LOOKS LIKE
WE'RE ONLY GONNA BE,

12:22.917 --> 12:25.041
LIKE, A HALF AN HOUR
AWAY FROM SALEM.

12:25.041 --> 12:28.083
I DON'T KNOW
THAT YOU'D BE SAFE
THERE, SWEETIE.

12:28.083 --> 12:29.500
HEY, CHARLIE,
WHAT'S THE NAME
OF THIS PLACE

12:29.500 --> 12:31.542
WE'RE PLAYING
AT AGAIN?

12:31.542 --> 12:33.834
"WE," HUH?

12:33.834 --> 12:35.125
I KNEW IT'D JUST
BE A MATTER OF TIME

12:35.125 --> 12:38.417
BEFORE YOU STARTED
TO EMBRACE THE LIFE
OF A ROCK STAR.

12:38.417 --> 12:40.667
YEAH, YOU'RE REALLY
ROUGHING IT OLD-SCHOOL
STYLE, BUDDY.

12:40.667 --> 12:42.375
HEY, THIS IS A REALLY
SWEET RIDE, PACEY.

12:42.375 --> 12:43.375
HOW MUCH
THIS SET YOU BACK?

12:43.375 --> 12:44.834
YOU KNOW, WHERE I
COME FROM, CHARLES,

12:44.834 --> 12:48.500
IT'S NOT POLITE
TO DIG INTO A MAN'S
FINANCIAL AFFAIRS.

12:48.500 --> 12:49.959
SO WHAT IS THE NAME
OF THIS PLACE

12:49.959 --> 12:51.041
WE'RE GOING TO,
ANYWAY?

12:51.041 --> 12:54.083
UH, THE DRUNK
AND THE DEAD.

12:54.083 --> 12:57.000
OH, THAT SOUNDS LIKE
A NICE FAMILY JOINT.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.041
NO, IT'S AWESOME.
I MEAN, I HAVEN'T
ACTUALLY BEEN THERE,

12:59.041 --> 13:00.166
BUT SOME OF
THE OTHER GUYS HAVE.

13:00.166 --> 13:02.542
I HEAR THE CROWD
REALLY GETS INTO IT.

13:02.542 --> 13:04.917
IT'S GONNA BE LIKE
AN ACTUAL SET, YOU KNOW?

13:04.917 --> 13:08.291
NOT JUST A BUNCH
OF COLLEGE KIDS
KILLING TIME.

13:09.625 --> 13:10.458
HEY, DON'T WORRY.

13:10.458 --> 13:13.166
I'M NOT WORRIED.

13:13.166 --> 13:14.166
JUST EXCITED?

13:14.166 --> 13:15.667
I'M NOT ANYTHING.

13:15.667 --> 13:17.959
HEH HEH! YEAH, RIGHT.

13:17.959 --> 13:19.625
IN YOUR MIND,
YOU'RE ALREADY IMAGINING

13:19.625 --> 13:20.875
YOUR GATEWAY DRUG
AND WHICH MODE
OF DESTRUCTION

13:20.875 --> 13:24.166
YOU'LL ATTACK THE HOTEL
ROOM WITH FIRST.

13:30.333 --> 13:33.959
WHAT'S UP WITH
YOU AND DAWSON?
IS IT GETTING OLD?

13:33.959 --> 13:34.750
OHH...

13:34.750 --> 13:37.667
NO, THINGS
ARE JUST...

13:37.667 --> 13:39.708
KIND OF COMING
INTO FOCUS

13:39.708 --> 13:40.708
BECAUSE I, YOU KNOW,

13:40.708 --> 13:43.667
I WAS SO QUICK
TO JUMP INTO THIS

13:43.667 --> 13:45.792
AND TELL EVERYBODY
THAT THEY WERE WRONG

13:45.792 --> 13:46.875
AND THAT I WAS RIGHT
AND ACTUALLY ME AND DAWSON

13:46.875 --> 13:49.667
WERE DESTINED
TO BE TOGETHER,

13:49.667 --> 13:51.250
AND IT WAS CRAZY.

13:51.250 --> 13:52.250
I JUST FEEL LIKE

13:52.250 --> 13:55.166
THAT EXISTED IN
SOME PARALLEL UNIVERSE,

13:55.166 --> 13:57.166
AND NOW
IT'S JUST SORT OF...

13:57.166 --> 13:59.041
SAFE.

13:59.041 --> 14:00.708
UGH.

14:00.708 --> 14:03.333
IF I ADMIT THAT, THEN...

14:03.333 --> 14:05.208
I AM REALLY
GONNA SEAL THE DEAL

14:05.208 --> 14:07.917
AS A DYSFUNCTIONAL
POSTER CHILD.

14:07.917 --> 14:08.917
AND IT'S NOT LIKE
STEVE THE INDIE ROCKER

14:08.917 --> 14:12.834
MADE ME HAVE
ANY PROFOUND REVELATIONS

14:12.834 --> 14:13.583
ABOUT THE MEANING
OF LOVE, BUT--

14:13.583 --> 14:16.000
BUT YOU FELT
SOMETHING.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.166
NO, I MISSED SOMETHING.

14:18.166 --> 14:20.834
THAT THING WHERE
YOU MEET SOMEBODY
FOR THE FIRST TIME

14:20.834 --> 14:21.834
AND YOU GET TO DECIDE
YES OR NO

14:21.834 --> 14:25.542
WITH ONLY
YOURSELF IN MIND.

14:25.542 --> 14:27.417
AND I DON'T WANT
TO BE THAT GIRL

14:27.417 --> 14:29.333
THAT'S UPSET
THAT SATURDAY NIGHTS
AREN'T MORE FUN.

14:29.333 --> 14:30.041
I MEAN, DAWSON
DOESN'T DESERVE THAT.

14:30.041 --> 14:32.208
HE'S HAD ENOUGH
ALREADY.

14:32.208 --> 14:35.333
JEN, YOU SHOULD
TELL HIM THAT.

14:41.959 --> 14:43.500
SO, DAWSON,
YOUR MOM TELLS ME

14:43.500 --> 14:46.458
YOU'RE ENJOYING
YOUR NEW FILM PROGRAM
IN BOSTON.

14:46.458 --> 14:48.166
YEP. YEAH.

14:50.083 --> 14:51.875
I USED TO DABBLE
A LITTLE BIT IN FILM

14:51.875 --> 14:53.083
WHEN I WAS IN AMHERST.

14:53.083 --> 14:55.125
NOTHING AS ADVANCED
AS YOU, BELIEVE ME.

14:55.125 --> 14:56.291
NO, I'M JUST
STARTING OUT.

14:56.291 --> 14:58.333
OH.

14:58.333 --> 15:00.542
W-WHAT ABOUT
THAT MATRIX  MOVIE?

15:00.542 --> 15:02.667
I MEAN, THEY USED
A LOT OF THAT NEW, UH,

15:02.667 --> 15:04.834
DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY,
DIDN'T THEY?

15:06.208 --> 15:08.250
RIGHT.

15:09.708 --> 15:12.375
WELL, THIS ONE
RIGHT HERE, I'LL TELL YOU.

15:12.375 --> 15:13.458
COME HERE,
MS. LILY-WILY,

15:13.458 --> 15:15.625
WE GOTTA KEEP
AN EYE ON YOU, RIGHT?

15:15.625 --> 15:19.250
THIS ONE, I'LL
TELL YOU, SHE GETS
INTO THOSE CRAYONS,

15:19.250 --> 15:20.917
AND HER MAMA
CALLS HER A GENIUS.

15:20.917 --> 15:23.834
HI, GENIUS.
I GUESS THE OLD

15:23.834 --> 15:27.417
VISUAL CREATIVE GENE
RUNS IN EVERYBODY'S
BLOOD IN THIS FAMILY.

15:31.583 --> 15:33.792
EXCUSE ME
FOR A MINUTE.

15:36.083 --> 15:37.375
HEY, PACE?

15:37.375 --> 15:38.667
YEAH, CHUCK.

15:38.667 --> 15:40.583
LOOK, I DON'T MEAN
TO BE A BACKSEAT DRIVER
OR ANYTHING,

15:40.583 --> 15:42.583
BUT WE KIND OF NEED TO
PUT THE PEDAL TO THE METAL,

15:42.583 --> 15:43.625
IF YOU KNOW
WHAT I MEAN.

15:44.959 --> 15:46.667
DID HE REALLY
JUST SAY THAT TO ME?

15:46.667 --> 15:47.625
YEAH.

15:47.625 --> 15:49.250
LOOK, I UNDERSTAND
THAT YOU WANT TO BE

15:49.250 --> 15:50.792
EASY ON THE OLD GIRL,
BUT COME ON, MAN,

15:50.792 --> 15:51.959
WE'RE RUNNING
A LITTLE LATE.

15:51.959 --> 15:53.667
WELL, MAYBE YOU'D
MADE BETTER TIME

15:53.667 --> 15:56.083
WITH THE OLD HOG,
HUH, CHUCK?

15:56.083 --> 15:58.083
HEY, NOW,
OK, GUYS. NO NEED
TO AUTO-BASH HERE.

15:58.083 --> 16:01.041
CHARLIE, HONEY,
I'M SURE WE'LL BE FINE.

16:01.041 --> 16:02.375
AND, PACEY, SWEETHEART,

16:02.375 --> 16:04.959
A LITTLE SPEED
NEVER HURT ANYBODY.

16:09.583 --> 16:11.500
YOU KNOW, IF YOU WANT ME
TO DRIVE, GRANNY,

16:11.500 --> 16:12.750
HEY, I CAN HOP UP FRONT,
ALL RIGHT?

16:12.750 --> 16:15.500
HEH HEH HEH. OK.

16:18.166 --> 16:20.792
Audrey:
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

16:20.792 --> 16:23.291
ANGER MANAGEMENT.
THIS ONE'S FOR ME.

16:23.291 --> 16:26.875
CHUCKLES,
GET OUT OF MY CAR.

16:31.708 --> 16:33.083
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

16:33.083 --> 16:34.125
THERE'S NO PROBLEM.
WE'RE LEAVING, AND
YOU'RE HITCHHIKING.

16:34.125 --> 16:36.125
OH, COME ON, MAN,
YOU'RE BEING RIDICULOUS.

16:36.125 --> 16:37.291
I'M BEING
RIDICULOUS?!
HERE WE GO.

16:37.291 --> 16:39.625
YOU'VE BEEN
ASKING FOR THIS
SINCE THE MOMENT

16:39.625 --> 16:41.125
YOU SHOWED UP THIS
MORNING UNINVITED.

16:41.125 --> 16:43.208
YOU KNOW, BELIEVE ME,
I'M REGRETTING IT
MORE AND MORE

16:43.208 --> 16:45.250
EVERY SINGLE SECOND,
BUT WHY DON'T YOU
CUT ME SOME SLACK

16:45.250 --> 16:46.834
BECAUSE
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW ME.

16:46.834 --> 16:48.750
AND YOU
DON'T KNOW ME,
BECAUSE IF YOU DID,

16:48.750 --> 16:50.041
YOU WOULD'VE
STARTED WALKING
5 MINUTES AGO.

16:50.041 --> 16:52.792
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.
YOU DON'T THINK
I CAN TAKE YOU?

16:52.792 --> 16:54.291
Audrey: HEY, GUYS,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

16:54.291 --> 16:55.583
YOU'RE BOTH
VERY MASCULINE

16:55.583 --> 16:57.708
AND THE GIRLS
ARE IMPRESSED.
CAN WE JUST GO NOW?

16:57.708 --> 17:00.500
ARE YOU
CHALLENGING ME?

17:00.500 --> 17:01.708
SHOULD I BOTHER?

17:01.708 --> 17:03.917
YOU WANT THAT?
THEN LET'S GO.

17:03.917 --> 17:04.916
LET'S GO. HONEY,
COULD YOU JUST HOLD

17:04.916 --> 17:07.500
ON TO THAT
FOR A SECOND?

17:07.500 --> 17:08.125
SNOOKUMS,
COME ON!

17:08.125 --> 17:09.834
COME
WITH ME NOW.

17:09.834 --> 17:11.250
I HAVE A LITTLE
BIT OF UNFINISHED
BUSINESS--

17:11.250 --> 17:13.666
YES, BUT YOUR
NEANDERTHAL CHARMS
HAVE ME SMITTEN.

17:13.666 --> 17:16.208
PLEASE COME WITH ME
INTO THE WOODS.

17:16.208 --> 17:18.250
THAT'S NOT FAIR,
THAT'S NOT FAIR.

17:18.250 --> 17:19.500
WHAT?

17:19.500 --> 17:20.500
THAT'S NOT FAIR.

17:20.500 --> 17:24.040
YEAH, LET YOUR WOMAN
TAKE CARE OF YOU.

17:24.040 --> 17:26.875
UGH!

17:26.875 --> 17:28.165
WHAT IS HIS PROBLEM?

17:28.165 --> 17:30.166
WHAT IS
