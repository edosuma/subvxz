Charlie, since the day
you arrived in this desert,

01:09.000 --> 01:10.525
you've been rejecting my canteen.

- I accept the job.

16:38.080 --> 16:39.366
Okay.

16:43.120 --> 16:45.122
Why don't we lock our doors by the way?

16:45.200 --> 16:46.850
What do you mean?

16:47.760 --> 16:51.924
When I let Javier in,
he said that people should lock their doors.

16:55.360 --> 16:56.725
(POUNDING ON WINDOW)

17:00.120 --> 17:01.531
Stay there.

17:08.839 --> 17:11.286
What the hell are you doing here?

17:12.680 --> 17:13.886
We need to talk.

17:15.880 --> 17:17.244
Be right back.

17:20.400 --> 17:23.085
MPs are sweeping my office,
they're frisking everyone.

17:23.160 --> 17:25.208
- We've created a monster.
- A useful monster.

17:25.280 --> 17:26.724
You remember, you knocked on my door.

17:26.800 --> 17:29.007
And now, 50 of my guys
are working on your problem.

17:29.080 --> 17:30.491
Our problem.

17:30.560 --> 17:33.370
I'm in a henhouse full of foxes
who think they're hens.

17:33.440 --> 17:35.522
Have you told them
you had to recheck all the Thin Man math?

17:35.600 --> 17:38.251
- Yeah.
-Then I don't understand. What's the issue?

17:38.320 --> 17:40.209
These are some of the smartest guys
in the world.

17:40.280 --> 17:43.284
How long do you think it'll take for them
to realize they're working on implosion?

17:43.360 --> 17:47.001
The shock wave calculations
are broken up into tiny parts.

17:47.080 --> 17:48.445
If the puzzle pieces are small enough,

17:48.520 --> 17:50.727
there is no way
one guy can see the big picture.

17:50.840 --> 17:52.126
Not one of your guys anyway.

17:52.720 --> 17:56.167
I want you to requisition 12 sets
of detonators and 100 pounds of TNT.

17:56.240 --> 17:58.891
No. I get you the math, you worry
about experiments. That's the deal.

17:58.960 --> 18:00.371
Well, there's a new deal.

18:00.440 --> 18:02.681
Akley gave you full authority
to sign for resources.

18:02.760 --> 18:04.888
Thin Man is finished with explosives testing.

18:04.960 --> 18:06.883
I go asking for detonators and TNT,

18:06.960 --> 18:09.566
the Army will be on my doorstep
an hour later.

18:09.640 --> 18:10.971
My source won't give us any.

18:11.040 --> 18:13.691
This was your idea. Figure it out.

18:13.760 --> 18:17.560
I need you to leave now.
Don't you come back to this house again.

18:38.800 --> 18:40.404
(KNOCKING)

18:44.760 --> 18:46.410
You were right, I lied.

18:46.520 --> 18:48.807
If you know who I am,
then you know I've spent the last year

18:48.880 --> 18:50.644
working on implosion.

18:51.640 --> 18:54.211
I'm not ready to give up on it.

18:54.320 --> 18:57.130
No matter what the Army or anyone else says.

18:58.640 --> 19:00.085
I respect that.

19:00.200 --> 19:02.089
I need detonators. I need TNT.

19:02.200 --> 19:06.444
Explosives belongs to your army.

19:06.520 --> 19:08.124
Yeah, but you're in charge
of doling them out.

19:08.200 --> 19:12.444
Should I go to the Colonel and tell him
you're going behind his back, huh?

19:12.520 --> 19:14.204
You won't do that.

19:14.760 --> 19:16.603
(SCOFFS) You don't know me.

19:16.680 --> 19:19.047
I know you worked
at the Navy Ordnance Bureau last year.

19:20.360 --> 19:22.249
I made some calls this morning.

19:22.320 --> 19:25.290
- Asked an old friend there about you.
- Who?

19:25.360 --> 19:26.566
Albert Einstein.

19:28.160 --> 19:31.130
He told me that you were a good scientist.

19:31.200 --> 19:32.770
He also told me you could be trusted.

19:32.840 --> 19:37.129
Listen, the only risk I would like to take

19:37.200 --> 19:39.043
is to work with my explosives.

19:40.040 --> 19:41.451
Understand?

19:44.040 --> 19:45.451
Fair enough.

19:47.440 --> 19:48.680
For your time.

19:49.920 --> 19:51.649
I don't take bribes.

19:53.400 --> 19:56.006
And Einstein was wrong.

19:56.080 --> 19:58.970
I'm not a scientist. I'm an engineer.

20:09.600 --> 20:12.285
All right.
Stay where Mommy can see you, Joey.

20:14.800 --> 20:17.485
To him, this is completely normal, hmm?

20:17.560 --> 20:18.721
(CHUCKLES)

20:19.200 --> 20:22.921
Then again, who am I to say what is normal?

20:27.760 --> 20:28.921
Howdy, ma'am?

20:29.280 --> 20:31.089
(GIGGLES)

20:35.080 --> 20:36.241
(SIGHS)

20:45.520 --> 20:46.885
Was it normal?

20:46.960 --> 20:48.007
Hmm?

20:48.480 --> 20:50.721
What happened between us that night.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.889
You Americans.

20:56.960 --> 20:59.964
Always looking for explanations.

21:00.880 --> 21:02.370
Or penance.

21:03.760 --> 21:05.489
What do you think happened?

21:05.560 --> 21:07.050
You fell asleep.

21:07.320 --> 21:08.651
(GIGGLES)

21:08.720 --> 21:11.291
Yes, but before I fell asleep.

21:12.560 --> 21:16.007
You know, the first time I made love
was a day just like this.

21:16.680 --> 21:18.569
Spring in winter.

21:20.120 --> 21:21.610
His name was Philippe.

21:21.680 --> 21:22.806
(GIGGLES)

21:23.240 --> 21:27.040
He had this belt, leather, all beat up.

21:30.160 --> 21:34.643
When he moved to London for university,
I made him give the belt to me.

21:36.240 --> 21:37.401
Still have it.

21:37.680 --> 21:40.001
Every now and then, I take it out.

21:41.400 --> 21:43.528
Sometimes I even

21:43.600 --> 21:46.365
bite it and taste it.

21:49.440 --> 21:52.011
Suddenly, I'm right back there.

21:55.120 --> 21:57.122
What if your husband found it?

21:59.000 --> 22:02.322
Secrets are what keep us alive, <i>chÃ©rie</i>.

22:04.560 --> 22:08.326
Without them, we'd just be normal.

22:23.880 --> 22:25.370
Well, come right in.

22:25.440 --> 22:28.808
If I'm going to be your number two,
you better get used to it.

22:28.880 --> 22:30.211
Are you ready to start working?

22:30.280 --> 22:33.329
You mean keep working
on implosion for Frank?

22:38.400 --> 22:40.209
Keep your voice down.

22:43.640 --> 22:46.405
- He told you?
- He didn't have to. I'm a clever girl.

22:46.480 --> 22:48.369
Thin Man has the resources, but it's flawed.

22:48.440 --> 22:50.522
Implosion's the right model,
but we have no manpower.

22:50.600 --> 22:52.489
What you guys can do in a day
will take us 10.

22:52.600 --> 22:53.647
I had to keep you in the dark.

22:53.720 --> 22:55.848
- Or I wouldn't pass the polygraph.
- Right.

22:55.920 --> 22:57.365
Right.

22:57.480 --> 22:58.811
So now I'm complicit in your crime.

22:58.880 --> 23:01.087
We're all sticking our necks out here.
We don't have a choice.

23:01.160 --> 23:02.969
I always have a choice.

23:05.240 --> 23:06.605
You can't tell anyone about this.

23:08.920 --> 23:12.606
By the way, I'm screwing Paul Crosley.

23:18.760 --> 23:21.286
MEEKS: <i>Terrible things
always happen in threes.</i>

23:21.360 --> 23:23.727
Next, they'll probably
stop printing Superman.

23:23.800 --> 23:26.610
- Helen will find her way back somehow.
- CROSLEY: I say good riddance.

23:26.680 --> 23:29.524
She doesn't know anything
about shock waves anyway.

23:31.320 --> 23:32.970

23:35.640 --> 23:37.130
We need to have some fun, boys.

23:37.200 --> 23:39.487
Should we assay your urine again?

Welcome to the wingding, gentlemen.

23:53.160 --> 23:55.049
- Mushrooms?
- Psychotropic mushrooms.

23:56.160 --> 23:59.607
Got them at the WAC dorm.
One of Jeannie's clients paid with these.

23:59.680 --> 24:01.330
Oh, Jeannie's still seeing clients.

24:02.000 --> 24:03.445
They're from the natives.

24:03.840 --> 24:06.889
We scarf these down,
we will see quite a show.

24:07.160 --> 24:08.241
Mmm.

24:08.320 --> 24:10.368
It's better than
diddling our thumbs in the lab, isn't it?

24:10.440 --> 24:13.250
You twiddle thumbs, you diddle yourself.

24:13.320 --> 24:14.731
Frequently, I'm sure.

24:15.320 --> 24:16.367
Uh...

24:16.440 --> 24:18.727
You know, I... I tried marijuana once,

24:18.800 --> 24:20.290
you don't even want to know
what happened.

24:20.360 --> 24:22.010
Let me guess,
you forgot your mother's phone number?

24:22.080 --> 24:25.243
Come on. The Indians have been eating
these for centuries. You will be fine.

No, no. She's way too wholesome.

25:00.800 --> 25:02.848
- What?
- All those high-neck blouses.

25:02.920 --> 25:06.766
No, but she's so beautiful
and she's married to Laurence Olivier.

25:06.840 --> 25:08.205
Oh, he can have her.

25:08.280 --> 25:12.330
I would take the sweater girl
over Vivien Leigh every night.

25:12.400 --> 25:13.970
Sweater girl?

25:14.040 --> 25:15.326
Lana Turner.

25:15.400 --> 25:20.486
Oh, she wears the most beautiful sweaters

25:20.560 --> 25:22.722

25:41.480 --> 25:43.801
Keep your maid another hour.
It costs pennies.

25:43.880 --> 25:45.211
I really should get back.

25:47.600 --> 25:49.443
You think too much about "should."

25:55.600 --> 25:58.080
Look at that, home before dinner.

25:59.320 --> 26:00.321
Oh.

26:00.400 --> 26:02.243
- Mrs. Isaacs, hello.
- Hello.

26:03.720 --> 26:07.247
I was just on my way.
Charlie should be back any time now.

26:07.320 --> 26:12.247
Well, it looked to me
like he'd be there half the night.

26:14.440 --> 26:16.920
- Heavy's the head that wears the crown.
- Mmm.

26:18.760 --> 26:20.046
Won't you stay for dinner?

26:20.440 --> 26:22.647
- I really shouldn't.
- Oh, yes, stay.

26:23.320 --> 26:26.802
Why go home and wait for your man when
you can be waited on for a change, huh?

26:36.120 --> 26:37.963
So this is nirvana?

26:39.080 --> 26:41.811
Yeah, your fungi weren't much fun, Fritz.

26:42.760 --> 26:44.000
Fungi.

You're in love with Helen, aren't you?

28:02.680 --> 28:04.205
Yeah, I suppose I am.

- They won't suspect a thing.
- Okay, stop it. Stop being weird.

29:16.200 --> 29:18.931
Meeks, you need to eat some more.

29:19.800 --> 29:21.643
Maybe your metabolism's different.

29:21.920 --> 29:23.684
Rate of absorption's too low.

29:25.400 --> 29:27.164

No, "metabolism."

29:39.280 --> 29:40.441
- What?
- Huh? Did you?

29:40.520 --> 29:43.410
No, of course not. The model changed.

On. (LAUGHING)

31:15.840 --> 31:17.205
No, well,

31:19.080 --> 31:20.605
I do know you.

31:21.240 --> 31:22.401
Hmm.

31:23.480 --> 31:24.641
I do know you.

31:25.920 --> 31:27.490
I see what you are.

31:33.840 --> 31:36.923
You can keep a secret.

31:37.040 --> 31:39.361
- Stop it.
- I'm just being neighborly.

31:40.400 --> 31:42.050
What are you doing? What are...

31:42.120 --> 31:43.531
Get...

31:43.600 --> 31:46.683
I see what Charlie is doing
and the minute he slips up,

31:46.800 --> 31:48.962
you can be sure I'll be waiting.

- No.

32:10.680 --> 32:12.842
No, no. It needs to be perfect
before he sees it.

32:12.920 --> 32:14.684
Double-check the math.

32:15.960 --> 32:17.689
I just didn't know you had it in you.

32:17.760 --> 32:19.683
Honestly, neither did I.

32:21.080 --> 32:22.730
We're gonna need another board.

32:49.800 --> 32:52.167
You are persistent.

32:52.280 --> 32:54.442
Persistency

32:54.520 --> 32:57.444
is an overrated quality in a man.

32:57.520 --> 32:59.602
The answer is still no.

32:59.680 --> 33:01.808
I didn't come for your explosives.

33:01.880 --> 33:05.043
Well, I have enough friends, thank you.

33:05.360 --> 33:07.203
I cheated on my wife.

33:11.520 --> 33:14.444
Why you tell me this, huh?

33:14.520 --> 33:17.251
Woman's cousin paid me a friendly visit.

33:18.080 --> 33:20.048
He says he's her cousin.

33:21.880 --> 33:23.848
He wants something.

33:24.240 --> 33:27.050
He left a present on my doorstep.

33:27.120 --> 33:30.249
Well, you have two roads.

33:31.360 --> 33:32.521
One.

33:35.200 --> 33:37.646
You go back home to your wife,

33:39.440 --> 33:41.488
and you tell her everything.

33:42.880 --> 33:45.486
Second road is sounding better.

33:45.560 --> 33:48.928
Well, you visit this cousin,

33:49.000 --> 33:52.846
make sure it's not a friendly visit.

33:52.920 --> 33:55.048
Situation like yours,

33:56.240 --> 34:01.929
they end in truth or violence.

34:06.120 --> 34:08.009
That's what I'm afraid of.

34:09.199 --> 34:10.884
What would you do?

34:12.000 --> 34:13.364
I'm sorry.

34:19.280 --> 34:21.282

34:23.080 --> 34:24.764

34:27.480 --> 34:28.811

that's mine.

37:30.400 --> 37:31.640
I don't understand.

37:32.120 --> 37:33.610
There was, uh...

37:33.680 --> 37:36.365
We were...
We were looking at absorption rates.

37:36.480 --> 37:39.927
What do absorption rates have to do
with shock wave control?

37:40.000 --> 37:42.731
Or anything else that matters?

37:42.800 --> 37:45.121
I don't remember.

37:46.680 --> 37:48.569
I don't care what the Brit said,

37:48.640 --> 37:50.847
until you're out of my lab,

37:50.920 --> 37:53.651
quit playing hangman on my blackboards.

38:18.040 --> 38:21.726
You know, a cattle rancher
used to own this land.

38:22.720 --> 38:26.122
From here all the way up to the mountains.

38:26.240 --> 38:29.961
But his oldest son,
he liked books, not cows.

38:30.040 --> 38:33.442
So he took off for college,
and when the old man died,

38:33.520 --> 38:35.363
the kid sells it.

38:36.280 --> 38:37.850
You know how much he got?

38:39.560 --> 38:42.689
$300 for all this. Yeah.

38:44.200 --> 38:46.931
Smart men make stupid choices.

38:49.200 --> 38:52.249
Cattle rancher stole it
from the Indians anyway.

38:52.320 --> 38:53.924
Well, if he hadn't,

38:54.000 --> 38:56.844
the two of us would never have met.

38:57.880 --> 39:01.089
You think we would be out here

to your wife?

39:18.680 --> 39:21.331

What?

Charlie, it was horrible.

He said something about
how he knew I could keep a secret.

What do you mean he touched you?

40:37.880 --> 40:38.927
You know what I mean.

40:41.240 --> 40:43.720
He groped me and he said something

40:43.800 --> 40:48.089
about he sees what you're doing,
and he's waiting for you to slip up and...

41:02.160 --> 41:03.321
Charlie?

41:09.040 --> 41:10.485
You have to do something.

Well, that's a refreshing attitude.

you had your pick of assignments.
