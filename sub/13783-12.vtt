02:10.509 --> 02:12.501
My darling wife...

02:13.980 --> 02:16.312
I have $68 put by-

02:20.120 --> 02:22.111
Our belly cleaveth
to the earth.

02:28.128 --> 02:30.119
I hope to be home
soon, Amanda.

02:31.631 --> 02:33.963
I'll help with
the cider pressing.

02:54.321 --> 02:57.916
Our souI is bowed
down to the dust.

03:33.126 --> 03:36.118
Tell Johnny to brew some coffee,
open some peaches.

03:54.114 --> 03:57.948
- Who are they? Is that the magistrate?
- Some with soldier saddles.

03:57.984 --> 04:01.715
- Al knew they was comin'.
- Well, he knew somethin' was comin'.

04:07.761 --> 04:11.458
I'd about decided he just
couldn't sleep without Trixie.

04:13.633 --> 04:15.100
General Crook bears
victory's garland

04:15.135 --> 04:18.935
for having routed
the Miniconjou at Slim Buttes.

04:18.971 --> 04:21.906
- Well done, General.
- The first meeting out of recompense

04:21.942 --> 04:23.876
for the massacre
at the Little Big Horn.

04:23.910 --> 04:27.107
Am I right in believing
that I saw you last year in the Hills?

04:28.448 --> 04:30.746
Amongst them
you gave the boot to?

04:30.784 --> 04:33.378
You said you'd see us back
once the treaty got amended.

04:33.420 --> 04:36.651
The day the general
spoke of... fast approaches.

04:36.690 --> 04:38.658
Even now he's called
to Camp Robinson...

04:38.692 --> 04:41.559
I'm waitin' for Al
to collect Clagett

04:41.595 --> 04:43.563
by the scruff
of the neck.

04:43.597 --> 04:46.760
He and his men would require
some resupply and respite.

04:48.768 --> 04:52.761
- Stopped at the right fuckin' place.
- Respite, Mr. Swearengen.

04:52.806 --> 04:55.969
Short of the men becoming dissolute
or drawn to desertion.

04:56.009 --> 04:59.137
Unsaddled, allowed to gamble,
roll in the dust, hmm?

04:59.179 --> 05:01.272
But not so they balk
at reharness.

05:01.314 --> 05:04.283
I'll make your feelings known
to the other operators.

05:07.253 --> 05:11.553
I and my fellow officers would be
gratefuI for the use of the bathhouse.

05:13.326 --> 05:16.727
Mr. Burns here
will steer you.

05:20.100 --> 05:23.900
For those that avenged Custer,
if it ain't too dissolute,

05:23.937 --> 05:25.928
the camp will
want a parade.

05:29.776 --> 05:32.768
A parade is all right.

05:35.782 --> 05:38.182
Forego your bath
a moment, Magistrate,

05:38.218 --> 05:42.712
unless you want a girI
to sponge you while we converse?

05:47.460 --> 05:49.291
So did young Adams
deliver my message?

05:49.329 --> 05:51.024
I haven't seen
young Adams.

05:51.064 --> 05:53.897
- No?
- I haven't been to Yankton.

05:53.933 --> 05:58.029
I've been representing the territory
in the treaty negotiations.

05:58.071 --> 06:02.030
Well, as to bribing you further for help
with that warrant against me

06:02.075 --> 06:04.703
beyond the $5,000
you've already pocketed,

06:04.744 --> 06:07.178
the gist was
"Fuck yourself. "

06:07.213 --> 06:11.047
- Do you now reconsider?
- No, Magistrate, I do not.

06:11.084 --> 06:14.713
Not if you've seen Adams
or if you haven't seen Adams.

06:14.754 --> 06:16.722
Well, that would
be imprudent, Al.

06:16.756 --> 06:20.556
A failure to properly value your freedom
in the promising days ahead.

06:20.593 --> 06:24.825
Maybe you don't value keeping your
fucking guts inside your belly enough.

06:24.864 --> 06:27.492
- Those are the days behind us.
- No,

06:27.534 --> 06:30.526
those are the days
to my fucking left.

06:31.971 --> 06:34.963
I didn't generate
the warrant.

06:35.008 --> 06:37.568
My disappearance
won't quash it.

06:37.610 --> 06:39.578
You can't
murder an order

06:39.612 --> 06:41.978
or the telegraph
that transmitted it

06:42.015 --> 06:44.347
or those that are content
to put food on the table

06:44.384 --> 06:46.944
simply by being
its instruments.

06:46.986 --> 06:48.977
It can't be done.

06:50.290 --> 06:53.350
Get the fuck
out of my joint.

06:53.393 --> 06:55.953
Although this may appear
to be a fortuitous accident-

06:55.995 --> 06:57.690
you're not in this,
Johnny Burns-

06:57.731 --> 07:00.256
I would be less than honest
if I did not admit that I was

07:00.300 --> 07:03.030
in fact Iying in wait,
in ambush, if you will.

07:03.069 --> 07:06.971
- Sir, make your first effort count.
- Seconds away.

07:07.006 --> 07:09.736
Now, General...

07:09.776 --> 07:11.437
your most victorious
smile.

07:14.781 --> 07:16.248
All right.

07:16.282 --> 07:19.774
Stern and resolute!

07:19.819 --> 07:22.219
This bloated tick
Clagett,

07:22.255 --> 07:25.224
feedin' on the neck
of the fucking military.

07:25.258 --> 07:27.920
I guess he bought
his bagman back.

07:27.961 --> 07:29.929
Who I commissioned
to kill him.

07:29.963 --> 07:31.430
He proclaims
their paths never crossed.

07:31.464 --> 07:33.261
I guess he would.

07:33.299 --> 07:35.665
Can you imagine, Al,
that as mayor,

07:35.702 --> 07:38.398
I might like to learn
the cavalry's in camp

07:38.438 --> 07:41.407
other than by coming upon them
posing for photographs

07:41.441 --> 07:43.170
in the goddamn
thoroughfare?!

07:43.209 --> 07:45.575
Cavalry's in camp, E.B.

07:45.612 --> 07:48.911
- At whose behest?
- The people, as always.

07:48.948 --> 07:51.348
- To what purpose?
- A parade's in the offing.

07:51.384 --> 07:53.716
They've had a victory
over the dirt worshippers.

07:53.753 --> 07:55.152
Will you lead
the hosannas?

07:55.188 --> 08:00.091
Well, I suppose that's
part of my mandate.

08:00.126 --> 08:04.153
Mightn't I also coordinate satisfaction
of the force's logistical needs?

08:04.197 --> 08:07.724
I hope you charge something
for your service.

08:10.670 --> 08:12.638
Cavalry in camp, Doc.

08:12.672 --> 08:15.470
May I number you in
the reception committee?

08:15.508 --> 08:18.534
Fuck the cavalry and the committee
that receives 'em!

08:18.578 --> 08:20.569
Hi, Doc.

08:23.850 --> 08:27.718
The fuckin' magistrate don't
go back to Yankton alive.

08:33.259 --> 08:35.227
Trixie?

08:35.260 --> 08:37.889
You seen JeweI
around anywheres?

08:37.931 --> 08:39.922
Common room.
Sweepin'.

08:43.602 --> 08:44.900
Hey, Doc?

08:44.938 --> 08:46.929
What you got
in your tote sack?

08:48.208 --> 08:49.698
Lettuce.

08:53.346 --> 08:57.077
Set your broom
to one side and sit down.

08:57.116 --> 08:59.141
I said put your
broom aside.

08:59.185 --> 09:01.847
You have to remove it
from my clutches.

09:01.888 --> 09:04.186
Okay.

09:04.224 --> 09:06.215
All right.

09:13.233 --> 09:15.724
I make this stipulation.

09:17.904 --> 09:22.068
You develop any stiffness
or numbness, you report these.

09:22.108 --> 09:25.441
You do not conceal
these symptoms in order

09:25.478 --> 09:28.845
to sustain your hopes
for the miraculous benefits

09:28.882 --> 09:31.544
of your fucking boot.

09:32.919 --> 09:34.887
That's my fuckin' boot?

09:34.921 --> 09:37.446
You lose a leg,
your other conditions

09:37.490 --> 09:39.458
will prevent you
from moving around at all,

09:39.492 --> 09:43.394
and I will not have you
lose the mobility that you do have

09:43.429 --> 09:46.227
for the sake of
a few weeks' illusion.

09:46.266 --> 09:50.100
I'll report stiffness
or numbness.

09:50.136 --> 09:53.401
All right.

09:53.439 --> 09:56.897
And pain or discomfort!

09:56.943 --> 09:59.309
Don't you
be the doctor!

09:59.345 --> 10:03.247
You report the symptoms,
I will determine their significance!

10:03.283 --> 10:04.910
Don't yell, Doc!

10:04.951 --> 10:07.419
I am yelling because
I want to make sure

10:07.453 --> 10:08.750
you goddamn
understand me!

10:08.788 --> 10:11.916
I do.
I understand.

10:11.958 --> 10:13.755
All right.

10:28.174 --> 10:30.165
Here's your goddamn boot.

10:35.815 --> 10:37.942
Help me put it on.

10:46.025 --> 10:49.119
Walk in unannounced is a good way
to get yourself killed, Doc.

10:49.162 --> 10:51.790
Especially as the cavalry
has us besieged.

10:51.831 --> 10:54.129
I'm here about
the minister.

10:54.167 --> 10:56.260
He's over at my place,

10:56.302 --> 10:58.327
past my art if I had any.

10:58.371 --> 11:01.363
He's damn near blind
and mostly paralyzed.

11:01.407 --> 11:03.500
Past controlling
his functions.

11:03.543 --> 11:06.979
Well, you're preaching
to the fucking converted. I mean...

11:07.013 --> 11:09.743
I would've seen
to him, but...

11:09.782 --> 11:10.976
I've been
fucking busy.

11:11.017 --> 11:14.350
Well, he doesn't want
to be seen to like that.

11:14.387 --> 11:17.151
What the fuck
are we talking about?

11:22.295 --> 11:24.695
A man being cared for,

11:24.731 --> 11:27.859
and made comfortable
till he expires.

11:27.900 --> 11:30.425
The girls you put
to the task,

11:30.470 --> 11:33.166
deduct your time
from my pay.

11:33.206 --> 11:35.333
I get the bag
of shit.

11:35.375 --> 11:39.641
You get to care for a human being
in his last extremity.

11:39.679 --> 11:43.706
A human being in his last
extremity is a bag of shit.

11:43.750 --> 11:45.581
Oh, fuck you, Al!

11:52.658 --> 11:55.092
I'll send someone over
to pick him up.

12:05.271 --> 12:08.365
I made JeweI
a brace and a boot.

12:10.009 --> 12:13.501
Does it allay the fucking noise she
makes when she drags her leg about?

12:13.546 --> 12:16.606
If the noise bothers you
so much, put cotton in your ears.

12:16.649 --> 12:18.844
Get the fuck out
of here, Doc, huh?

12:18.885 --> 12:23.117
I'm working on my deployments
and flanking maneuvers.

12:26.325 --> 12:28.316
How about that other one?

12:29.929 --> 12:31.920
Trixie's fine.

12:42.308 --> 12:43.900
Johnny!

12:43.943 --> 12:46.070
Take the sled
to Doc Cochran's.

12:46.112 --> 12:49.377
Collect the fucking minister and install
him in the whore's quarters.

12:49.415 --> 12:52.612
Tell that other one
to make up the fucking room.

12:52.652 --> 12:54.347
Trixie?

12:59.492 --> 13:02.017
These rags were fine
broadcloth shirts

13:02.061 --> 13:04.222
before I brung 'em
to launder.

13:04.263 --> 13:05.560
Huh?

13:05.598 --> 13:07.532
Six...
six bits...

13:07.567 --> 13:08.932
No, no.
You told me-

13:08.968 --> 13:13.462
Looks to me like
a deteriorating situation, Sheriff.

13:13.506 --> 13:16.669
Yup. Too frequent to be borne.
Downright intolerable.

13:16.709 --> 13:18.768
Six bits a goddamn piece,
you hear me?

13:18.811 --> 13:20.540
What the fuck
you talking about?

13:20.580 --> 13:22.912
Look at this goddamn shit.
What is that?

13:22.949 --> 13:26.248
I hope that slant-eyed
cocksucker's look

13:26.285 --> 13:29.584
ain't as arrogant close up as it appears
from this distance!

13:29.622 --> 13:31.920
Smells like shit.
You celestials

13:31.958 --> 13:35.450
are trying to wash our shirts
in goddamn feces!

13:37.463 --> 13:40.330
Mining gold, Alma,
is a different business

13:40.366 --> 13:42.334
from panning it
in a stream.

13:42.368 --> 13:45.030
The machinery involved,
the wages,

13:45.071 --> 13:47.005
it demands capital.

13:50.476 --> 13:53.775
If, as seems clear,
you've determined to stay,

13:53.813 --> 13:56.475
I could see after your
requirements in New York,

13:56.516 --> 14:00.816
secure your holdings' credit
as its eastern representative.

14:00.853 --> 14:03.879
Would that please you?

14:03.923 --> 14:05.220
I- I don't
know, Daddy.

14:05.258 --> 14:07.692
- I'm not sure it would.
- Why not?

14:07.727 --> 14:10.560
I'm not sure I can
explain beyond

14:10.596 --> 14:13.963
saying the prospect
frightens me.

14:14.000 --> 14:17.527
Must the pretense of my behavior
generating from...

14:17.570 --> 14:20.664
paternal concern
be abandoned so quickly?

14:20.706 --> 14:24.233
If you acknowledge what else
it generates from,

14:24.277 --> 14:26.507
I'll not abandon
the idea at all.

14:26.546 --> 14:32.416
From my debts,
of course.

14:32.451 --> 14:34.578
You said they'd been
entirely satisfied.

14:34.620 --> 14:37.748
They had, entirely.
Those debts.

14:37.790 --> 14:41.021
These are debts
you hadn't admitted?

14:41.060 --> 14:43.255
No, these are debts
I incurred subsequently.

14:43.296 --> 14:47.562
We might call them the children
of the debts that I admitted to.

14:47.600 --> 14:51.058
Generating from the interest
on the previous debts?

14:52.638 --> 14:54.868
Alma...

14:56.809 --> 14:59.369
watching you struggle
with what is beneath

14:59.412 --> 15:02.870
your spirit to understand
is always painfuI for me.

15:06.252 --> 15:11.485
After you got me out of debt,
I got myself back in.

15:17.263 --> 15:19.925
Having volunteered
a promise you had...

15:19.966 --> 15:23.902
wept and volunteered?

15:23.936 --> 15:25.961
Conceive my own
disappointment.

15:26.005 --> 15:31.568
Oh, Daddy.

15:31.611 --> 15:35.445
47,000, Button.

15:35.481 --> 15:37.779
47,000?

15:37.817 --> 15:40.081
Has scale, doesn't it?

15:40.119 --> 15:42.781
Certainly, there's
something to that.

15:42.822 --> 15:45.416
Who would give you
that much credit?

15:45.458 --> 15:49.519
My daughter becoming a Garret raised
me in the lender's estimation.

15:51.964 --> 15:54.762
I could borrow that much
against the claim?

15:54.800 --> 15:55.994
In an instant...

15:56.035 --> 15:58.003
and considerably more.

16:00.539 --> 16:02.530
All right, Daddy.

16:05.077 --> 16:09.207
But in consideration,
you will...

16:09.248 --> 16:14.185
remove yourself from further
connection to the venture.

16:14.220 --> 16:16.814
I'll have that in writing
before I help you.

16:20.293 --> 16:23.319
No, darling.
You'll help me...

16:23.362 --> 16:26.627
and you'll have
no such thing.

16:29.935 --> 16:32.904
Get away from her.

16:32.938 --> 16:35.634
Get away from her!

16:41.213 --> 16:43.181
The meal's on me,
young lady.

16:43.215 --> 16:45.206
Why, thank you, sir.

16:51.624 --> 16:55.116
My friend Jane repaid some money
I thought never to see,

16:55.161 --> 16:59.325
plus $2 some-odd
for Mrs. Garret to give that girI.

17:00.966 --> 17:04.992
Fines she levied against herself
for saying "fuck" or the like.

17:05.037 --> 17:08.063
Something amiss, Mrs. Garret?
Has the child took ill?

17:14.246 --> 17:17.443
I'll give her
the money later.

17:25.223 --> 17:26.714
Seth.

17:30.563 --> 17:32.724
What is it,
Mrs. Garret?

17:32.765 --> 17:35.734
Seth, I've got
to go do that... thing.

17:35.768 --> 17:37.258
What is it?

17:37.303 --> 17:39.498
Whatever impression
my father has made on you,

17:39.538 --> 17:41.301
please believe me,
Mr. Bullock,

17:41.340 --> 17:45.743
who has known him longer,
that he is here in his own interests...

17:45.778 --> 17:47.712
and against mine
and this child's.

17:47.747 --> 17:49.578
I do.

17:49.615 --> 17:52.209
And I need
your help.

17:52.251 --> 17:55.277
I'm asking for your help.

17:57.289 --> 18:00.520
You have it.

18:00.559 --> 18:04.188
Having confessed to the miserable
outcome of my commemorative effort,

18:04.230 --> 18:07.688
I'll throw myself on General Crook's
mercy and ask for a second opportunity.

18:07.733 --> 18:10.065
I'll be surprised
if he doesn't give it to you.

18:10.102 --> 18:13.503
They love-
to have their pictures taken.

18:18.244 --> 18:20.212
- What happened?
- Get away from me, SoI.

18:20.246 --> 18:21.645
- What is it?
- Get away.

18:21.680 --> 18:23.910
- Should I stay with her at the store?
- Please.

18:30.022 --> 18:33.423
Antemeridian constitutional,
Mr. Russell,

18:33.459 --> 18:36.724
or will we roll
the bones again?

18:36.762 --> 18:39.094
It must cost you sleep-

18:39.131 --> 18:42.225
the guests you drive off,
the chances of thieving

18:42.268 --> 18:47.968
and bilking you lose,
needing to rub against your betters.

18:54.947 --> 18:57.882
You and I are gonna talk.

18:57.917 --> 19:00.943
You don't account for my
preferences, Mr. Bullock?

19:00.986 --> 19:03.454
I will beat you here
in the street.

19:03.489 --> 19:06.151
First-rate thinking.

19:07.426 --> 19:11.192
My daughter's agent beats
her father in the street.

19:11.230 --> 19:13.858
How better to condemn Alma
to deepened suspicion

19:13.899 --> 19:17.198
as to her role in
her husband's violent death

19:17.236 --> 19:20.637
and widen suspicion
to include yourself?

19:21.640 --> 19:23.574
Shoot craps,
Mr. Bullock?

19:31.917 --> 19:33.908
I know what's
in the till.

19:36.822 --> 19:41.020
Were you bullied, Mr. Bullock,
when young and incapable?

19:42.862 --> 19:46.730
Now you see wrongs everywhere
and bullying you feeI called to remedy?

19:46.765 --> 19:49.495
- 10, lay due.
- New shooter coming out.

19:49.535 --> 19:51.901
The bully who
oppressed your youth

19:51.937 --> 19:54.064
isn't at the table
with us.

19:54.106 --> 19:57.667
- Perhaps he's long dead.
- Eight.

19:57.710 --> 20:00.474
If you will view the present
with more clarity,

20:00.513 --> 20:03.914
perhaps you'd recognize
that I'm not victimizing my daughter,

20:03.949 --> 20:08.215
but merely asking for a small portion
of the ample proceeds...

20:08.254 --> 20:11.746
- from her veins.
- Seven out.

20:11.790 --> 20:15.851
Alma is hurt only
in your particular view of things.

20:15.895 --> 20:18.261
10 again, lay due.

20:18.297 --> 20:21.926
And while I'll sign no
guarantee not to return,

20:21.967 --> 20:24.697
or against any future
claim on her compassion,

20:24.737 --> 20:27.900
realize I do hate it here.

20:27.940 --> 20:32.400
And if you inhale and expeI
pure righteousness,

20:32.444 --> 20:35.106
my olfactories are keen
to the smell of shit.

20:37.182 --> 20:39.116
Six, the point is six.

20:39.151 --> 20:42.279
Having heard all that,
and knowing, as you must,

20:42.321 --> 20:44.846
the injudiciousness
of making an enemy of a man

20:44.890 --> 20:49.259
who could testify truthfully that five
minutes before her marriage,

20:49.295 --> 20:53.254
he heard his daughter wish
her prospective husband dead,

20:53.299 --> 20:57.963
and who won't shrink from Iying
as to what she admitted

20:58.003 --> 21:00.597
to him on his arrival
in this cesspooI

21:00.639 --> 21:03.904
as to her complicity
in her husband's murder...

21:05.444 --> 21:07.810
I suppose you'd best
take your swing.

21:09.515 --> 21:11.449
Gentlemen,
watch the felt.

21:19.124 --> 21:21.115
Seth.

21:21.160 --> 21:24.960
Seth!

21:24.997 --> 21:28.626
All right.

21:28.667 --> 21:30.862
Leave this camp,
and draw a map

21:30.903 --> 21:33.269
for anyone who wants
to believe your fucking lies.

21:33.305 --> 21:35.273
Anyone wants
to put your daughter

21:35.307 --> 21:38.743
or her holdings in jeopardy,
you show 'em how to get here.

21:38.777 --> 21:41.837
And you tell 'em
I'll be waiting.

22:09.775 --> 22:11.174
Please...

22:12.544 --> 22:15.513
see to my father.

22:57.222 --> 23:00.282
Now, gentlemen, stay back!
This ain't no single-shot derringer.

23:00.325 --> 23:02.316
He tried to blind me
with that Iye, Sheriff,

23:02.361 --> 23:04.090
for showing what he
done to my shirts.

23:05.364 --> 23:08.925
- Fuck that monkey noise!
- All right, enough!

23:10.569 --> 23:14.471
...Till I can sort out
all the full particulars here.

23:14.506 --> 23:17.475
You may be a big shot in this alley,
but you are less than a nigger to me!

23:17.509 --> 23:19.409
Quiet!

23:19.445 --> 23:25.441
Or you'll be
subject to reprimand.

23:25.484 --> 23:28.476
Take jurisdiction
on this corpse!

23:32.725 --> 23:35.159
Back off, old man.

23:55.981 --> 23:59.439
The Sioux and the Cheyenne
having burned the prairie

23:59.485 --> 24:02.545
to deny us fodder
for our mounts,

24:02.588 --> 24:05.557
our provisions limited
to what we could carry,

24:05.591 --> 24:08.822
we turned for the Black Hills
when the rains began.

24:08.861 --> 24:11.887
Where my bay mare
Sheraton foundered, and got shot.

24:11.930 --> 24:15.422
That march through mud
was a trial sent by God,

24:15.467 --> 24:19.403
and harsh necessity
required of us

24:19.438 --> 24:22.566
much suffering
and great sacrifice.

24:22.608 --> 24:24.405
Ate our fucking horses!

24:24.443 --> 24:27.970
Continuing south, we proved
our worth against the Indian.

24:28.013 --> 24:30.311
We came upon a village

24:30.349 --> 24:32.146
at Slim Buttes,

24:32.184 --> 24:36.120
at once attacked
from all four sides.

24:40.626 --> 24:44.460
Their resistance was overcome.
There were no prisoners.

24:44.496 --> 24:47.863
Paid 'em out man, woman and child
for me having to eat my mare.

24:47.900 --> 24:49.595
And after the village
was taken,

24:49.635 --> 24:52.126
we found the gloves
of Captain Keogh,

24:52.171 --> 24:56.403
last seen on his person
when he rode into battle...

24:57.643 --> 24:59.634
with the valiant Custer.

24:59.678 --> 25:01.669
Captain.

25:03.916 --> 25:06.714
This is the guidon
of the 7th Cavalry

25:06.752 --> 25:09.346
captured by the Sioux
at the Little Big Horn.

25:09.388 --> 25:12.949
And now reclaimed
by white men!

25:14.593 --> 25:17.721
Chief American Horse
and his village

25:17.763 --> 25:20.493
are gone, driven off.

25:21.500 --> 25:23.365
From this
day forward...

25:23.402 --> 25:26.894
- Where's the cunt?
- ... any Sioux who will not make peace

25:26.939 --> 25:30.067
- at Camp Robinson-
- Glad you witnessed that transaction

25:30.108 --> 25:32.474
amongst the celestials.

25:32.511 --> 25:35.571
You know, they'll bow and scrape
till six of 'em get together,

25:35.614 --> 25:37.548
then no fucking
white man's safe.

25:37.583 --> 25:40.609
...to the progress
of the United States...

25:42.287 --> 25:45.313
of which I am certain

25:45.357 --> 25:47.757
this camp...

25:47.793 --> 25:49.385
will soon be a part.

25:49.428 --> 25:54.692
Huzzah!

25:54.733 --> 25:56.724
Next murder you do
on an errand,

25:56.768 --> 25:58.759
gotta take off
the fucking badge.

25:59.771 --> 26:01.762
Not certain I take
your inference.

26:03.075 --> 26:05.805
And if I do,
I'm not sure I like it.

26:12.818 --> 26:15.810
Leave it there,
you bought-out son of a bitch.

26:24.062 --> 26:27.395
Captain Bubb is the quartermaster
and commissary officer.

26:27.432 --> 26:29.696
- Should he deal with you?
- Exclusively.

26:29.735 --> 26:33.227
- E.B. Farnum-
- That's Captain Bubb.

26:33.272 --> 26:37.902
Mayor. And as to procurement
of everything listed,

26:37.943 --> 26:39.535
your civilian
counterpart.

26:39.578 --> 26:43.446
General Crook, I believe I have you
verbatim, but if you'd grant me

26:43.482 --> 26:45.347
- a moment to confirm?
- Oh my God.

26:45.384 --> 26:47.909
Um, "The Sioux
and Cheyenne...

27:06.571 --> 27:08.368
...will soon be a part. "

27:08.407 --> 27:12.207
You'll find this hoteI the least
of all evils.

27:12.244 --> 27:14.542
Does it belong
to that mayor?

27:14.579 --> 27:17.047
Yes, but I can
check you in.

27:17.082 --> 27:19.550
General,
Cyrus Tolliver.

27:19.584 --> 27:22.917
Small gesture of gratitude,
I'd like you to quarter at my place.

27:22.955 --> 27:26.049
BrotheI. Excuse me.

27:26.091 --> 27:29.891
Well, that portion to my use would
have to be closed to other purposes.

27:31.263 --> 27:33.561
Well, that'd make it
a large gesture, but, uh,

27:33.598 --> 27:35.190
we'll work something out.

27:36.935 --> 27:39.904
- Send my trunk, Captain Bubb.
- Yes, sir.

27:39.938 --> 27:43.237
This is a tremendous number
of provisions, Captain.

27:43.275 --> 27:45.835
But, of course, you're
buying for full-grown men.

27:50.983 --> 27:52.951
I won't do
a two on one.

27:52.985 --> 27:54.919
Take turns
like white men.

27:54.953 --> 27:57.421
I don't care if the whole
U.S. Cavalry walks in here,

27:57.456 --> 27:59.583
you don't want
to pour another drink.

27:59.624 --> 28:02.286
You just want to listen to me
'cause if the man doesn't die

28:02.327 --> 28:03.658
whose face I just broke,

28:03.695 --> 28:05.686
he's gonna go
to New York City

28:05.731 --> 28:09.360
and tell Brom Garret's people
it breaks his heart to say so,

28:09.401 --> 28:11.869
but his daughter
had their son murdered.

28:11.903 --> 28:13.768
He'll tell 'em,
knowing how he does,

28:13.805 --> 28:16.205
they won't want their
son's rightfuI property

28:16.241 --> 28:18.368
in the hands of the woman
who killed him.

28:18.410 --> 28:20.571
He'll swear to what
he heard from her own lips.

28:20.612 --> 28:23.410
And those society people
in New York City,

28:23.448 --> 28:27.214
who live with their heads
up their asses anyway, will believe him.

28:27.252 --> 28:30.221
And whoever they send out here
may take up to 15 minutes

28:30.255 --> 28:32.587
before they decide
that you were involved

28:32.624 --> 28:34.558
in the transaction
first to last.

28:34.593 --> 28:37.084
It must have been
you and your boss she hired

28:37.129 --> 28:39.529
to push her idiot husband
off the cliff.

28:39.564 --> 28:41.759
Of course, they'll be wrong
about Mrs. Garret,

28:41.800 --> 28:46.396
but they'll be right as rain
about you two cocksuckers.

28:46.438 --> 28:50.534
You tell him
all that upstairs.

28:50.575 --> 28:54.203
If he don't die.

28:54.246 --> 28:57.647
I don't think
I killed him.

28:58.784 --> 29:02.185
Just so I understand you,

29:02.220 --> 29:04.688
if he don't die,

29:04.723 --> 29:08.682
you're saying the man's luck
don't have to hold out.

29:08.727 --> 29:11.218
Now, that's the message
you want me to take upstairs.

29:12.230 --> 29:14.198
I don't swim
in that shit.

29:14.232 --> 29:17.895
You ought to pin that
on your chest.

29:19.004 --> 29:22.235
You're hypocrite
enough to wear it.

29:22.274 --> 29:24.265
You just tell him.

29:29.915 --> 29:34.215
When did you start thinking
every wrong had a remedy, Wu?

29:34.252 --> 29:36.083
Did you come to camp
for justice

29:36.121 --> 29:38.646
or to make
your fucking way?!

30:24.636 --> 30:26.763
I'm sensing you've
done things today

30:26.805 --> 30:28.796
you wish you
could amend, Seth.

30:32.811 --> 30:35.871
What kind of a man
have I become, SoI?

30:36.982 --> 30:38.973
I don't know.

30:40.819 --> 30:42.980
The day ain't
fucking over.

30:55.267 --> 30:58.065
Under what provocation
was that clown-hatted card-sharp

30:58.103 --> 31:00.071
when he slaughtered
the Chink?

31:00.105 --> 31:04.542
I was head down, Al,
towing that minister like a canal mule.

31:04.576 --> 31:07.568
Well, in the aftermath,
when you raised your fucking head,

31:07.612 --> 31:10.410
did Stapleton act like
a fucking frightened man?

31:10.448 --> 31:12.848
More strutting like
a dunghill rooster.

31:12.884 --> 31:15.751
Put-up fucking job.

31:15.787 --> 31:18.483
That fucknut Tolliver's
moving on Chinatown.

31:18.523 --> 31:20.650
That devious
fucknut.

31:20.692 --> 31:24.822
As far as this matter Bullock
commended to our attention...?

31:24.863 --> 31:27.832
Well, it's the exact type
murder you preach, Al.

31:27.866 --> 31:29.834
Head off trouble
down the road.

31:29.868 --> 31:33.668
You head off trouble down the road once
you've dealt with the trouble on it.

31:33.705 --> 31:35.935
The trouble
on the road, Dan,

31:35.974 --> 31:37.942
is Al's enemy
Magistrate Clagett's

31:37.976 --> 31:40.774
cozy-seeming connection
to the military.

31:40.812 --> 31:42.439
If genuine,
Al must decide-

31:42.480 --> 31:44.573
ought he seek some
alliance with Clagett,

31:44.616 --> 31:47.449
however temporary
or dissembled?

31:47.485 --> 31:49.953
At least untll you're paid
for the army's order.

31:49.988 --> 31:52.456
They're all in the same
fucking place.

31:52.490 --> 31:54.617
Tolliver, the widow's father,
Clagett-

31:54.659 --> 31:56.786
I can take care of all
of 'em in one fell swoop.

31:56.828 --> 31:59.797
What about half of the cavalry
while your talons are out, huh?

31:59.831 --> 32:02.766
I'll tell you, by God,
you cut that fucking general's throat,

32:02.801 --> 32:05.099
you'll... you'll hurry
the pace of desertion.

32:06.805 --> 32:08.830
Did I say
something funny?

32:20.118 --> 32:22.450
That cocksucker
Clagett's bagman.

32:28.960 --> 32:30.951
Moderation
in all things.

32:35.967 --> 32:37.958
Thank you,
thank you, sir.

32:39.971 --> 32:43.964
- Much obliged.
- Good luck.

33:01.760 --> 33:04.729
With all respect to the
Magistrate Clagett, General,

33:04.763 --> 33:09.325
eager as we are to get taken into
the territory, those wheels grind slow,

33:09.367 --> 33:12.564
while every day
in this camp and environs

33:12.604 --> 33:16.404
tens of thousands of dollars in gold get
cleaned up, and put into circulation.

33:16.441 --> 33:19.410
It's an environment
to test the moral mettle

33:19.444 --> 33:22.811
if we was all members of some
religious organization.

33:22.847 --> 33:26.044
Which we ain't.

33:28.687 --> 33:30.678
Are we sure
we can't tempt you?

33:34.225 --> 33:35.692
I'm sure.

33:35.727 --> 33:39.026
A small fraction of your
detachment left behind,

33:39.064 --> 33:41.191
a dozen or 18 men, say,

33:41.232 --> 33:44.258
would keep the criminal
element in check.

33:44.302 --> 33:46.930
Cash compensation,
unrecorded.

33:48.306 --> 33:50.274
To defend against
threats from without,

33:50.308 --> 33:52.776
I suggest the camp
create a militia.

33:52.811 --> 33:55.644
For civll disorders
and property disagreements,

33:55.680 --> 33:56.977
have you hired
a sheriff?

33:57.015 --> 33:59.506
Yeah, we got one.

33:59.551 --> 34:02.213
Did you say to me earlier,
Mr. Tolliver,

34:02.253 --> 34:05.222
that you imagined that the chief use
of the military presence

34:05.256 --> 34:07.451
was to buttress
the sheriff's authority?

34:07.492 --> 34:11.326
Such indirection for
such a tawdry purpose.

34:11.362 --> 34:14.696
$50,000 in gold.

34:14.733 --> 34:17.998
I want those
soldiers, General.

34:18.036 --> 34:20.004
Is that direct enough?

34:20.038 --> 34:23.030
May I speak?

34:23.074 --> 34:25.804
Mr. Bullock.

34:27.011 --> 34:29.241
I was a marshal
in Montana.

34:29.280 --> 34:32.078
My father served
in the British Royal Army,

34:32.117 --> 34:34.949
and my brother Robert
was a cavalryman

34:34.985 --> 34:37.545
killed fighting
the Comancheros in Texas.

34:37.589 --> 34:40.149
Why are you here,
Mr. Bullock?

34:42.726 --> 34:46.788
A man named Otis Russell
is laid up in this establishment.

34:46.831 --> 34:50.096
- He needs protection.
- Protection from whom?

34:51.835 --> 34:54.168
Several in this camp.

34:54.205 --> 34:56.672
I beat him badly.

34:56.708 --> 34:58.938
Others have reason
to wish him dead,

34:58.977 --> 35:02.743
and the camp sheriff can be bought off
for half a can of bacon grease.

35:06.751 --> 35:09.015
Well, while we're here,

35:09.053 --> 35:12.181
I will hold Mr. Russell
under protection

35:12.223 --> 35:15.056
as a gesture to your
brother's sacrifice.

35:15.093 --> 35:17.061
Thank you, sir.

35:17.095 --> 35:20.462
I would add- in a camp

35:20.498 --> 35:23.661
where the sheriff can be
bought for bacon grease,

35:23.701 --> 35:26.829
a man, a former marshal

35:26.871 --> 35:30.170
who understands the danger
of his own temperament,

35:30.208 --> 35:34.542
might consider
serving his fellows.

35:34.579 --> 35:37.173
May I have
a word, General?

35:38.183 --> 35:40.413
I'm through.
Thank you.

35:40.452 --> 35:42.647
We all have
bloody thoughts.

35:50.895 --> 35:52.863
Captain Bubb?

35:52.897 --> 35:54.922
That gopher-faced
merchant's agent,

35:54.966 --> 35:56.866
he's trying
for our eye-teeth, General.

35:56.901 --> 35:59.199
I'd rather we provision
with the fucking Sioux.

35:59.237 --> 36:01.831
I have three men under guard
for burying their uniforms

36:01.873 --> 36:03.738
and five for bartering
their weapons.

36:03.775 --> 36:05.538
Bartering them
for what?

36:05.577 --> 36:08.307
Women, credit at the tables
and prospecting tools.

36:08.346 --> 36:11.611
God damn it.

36:11.649 --> 36:13.139
Form up the men.

36:13.184 --> 36:15.778
We'll bivouac tonight
outside of camp.

36:15.820 --> 36:19.119
At daylight, we head
for Camp Robinson.

36:19.157 --> 36:22.615
Please allow me to seek remedy
in the manner of resupply, General.

36:22.660 --> 36:26.357
We move for Camp Robinson, Magistrate,
with or without your company.

36:26.397 --> 36:28.262
I quite understand.

36:29.667 --> 36:32.568
12 men, General.
$50,000.

36:32.604 --> 36:35.368
If I were sheriff,
I'd have you hanged.

36:37.408 --> 36:39.569
I brought these.

36:47.352 --> 36:48.842
Are these
my father's?

36:48.887 --> 36:51.447
Collected off
the Bella Union floor.

36:51.489 --> 36:53.548
Maybe modeI
replacements after,

36:53.591 --> 36:56.685
maybe just remind him
not to run his mouth.

36:56.728 --> 36:59.196
Miss Stubbs, will you
please come in?

36:59.230 --> 37:01.027
Oh, all right.

37:01.065 --> 37:03.397
Joanie!

37:03.434 --> 37:05.902
Hi, sweetheart.

37:08.239 --> 37:11.697
He will live, though,
that seems clear?

37:11.743 --> 37:14.109
Seems he will.

37:15.880 --> 37:18.178
Mr. Bullock was
my agent in this.

37:23.955 --> 37:26.617
On our way from
Syracuse to Indiana

37:26.658 --> 37:28.853
so my daddy
could try farming,

37:28.893 --> 37:30.861
my mama got cholera
and died.

37:30.895 --> 37:34.387
He didn't make any better a farmer
than millinery clerk,

37:34.432 --> 37:38.459
but he had a way enough
with words to get me believing

37:38.503 --> 37:41.233
that my mama in heaven
wanted me to see to his needs.

37:41.272 --> 37:44.036
And then to add
to the egg money by...

37:44.075 --> 37:47.203
seeing to the men
he brought,

37:47.245 --> 37:49.611
and she wanted me
talking my sisters

37:49.647 --> 37:53.083
into seeing to his needs,
and then to the men,

37:53.117 --> 37:56.348
till he sold me
to Cy Tolliver.

37:58.289 --> 37:59.722
If he was here,

37:59.757 --> 38:03.318
I'd wish a beating mornings
and evenings on my daddy

38:03.361 --> 38:05.795
like your pa took today.

38:07.999 --> 38:09.990
Oh.

38:23.081 --> 38:26.107
Evening.

38:27.852 --> 38:30.480
Good evening,
Mr. Bullock.

38:37.362 --> 38:39.421
Are you hungry, honey?

38:39.464 --> 38:41.659
Why don't we go down
to that little restaurant

38:41.699 --> 38:43.792
and have some dinner?

38:43.835 --> 38:47.362
Um, uh- Sophia.

38:50.708 --> 38:55.168
You go with Miss Stubbs
for dinner, okay?

39:21.239 --> 39:23.537
Would you like
to sit down, Mr. Bullock?

39:23.574 --> 39:25.735
Untll your father's
well enough to traveI,

39:25.777 --> 39:28.143
I've asked General Crook
to see to his safety.

39:30.248 --> 39:31.613
Thank you.

39:31.649 --> 39:33.310
If he were to leave
once he's well

39:33.351 --> 39:35.512
and return to act
against your interests,

39:35.553 --> 39:38.716
we'll deal
with that then.

39:43.294 --> 39:46.752
I stand before you
a married man.

39:46.798 --> 39:48.493
Yes.

39:48.533 --> 39:51.229
To your brother's widow,

39:51.269 --> 39:54.432
after he was killed.

39:54.472 --> 39:57.771
You took their five-year-old boy
as your own son.

39:57.809 --> 40:00.300
Married.

40:02.146 --> 40:04.137
Yes.

40:26.370 --> 40:31.637
If you'd- if you would be
more comfortable behind the screen...

40:36.380 --> 40:39.281
Wouldn't that
defeat our purpose?

41:33.771 --> 41:35.864
Young Adams.

41:35.907 --> 41:38.137
No satcheI? No case?

41:38.176 --> 41:40.508
Don't tell me you shrunk
that magistrate's head,

41:40.545 --> 41:42.536
so you can carry it
around in your coat.

41:42.580 --> 41:44.810
And that warrant
against me now quashed,

41:44.849 --> 41:46.817
is peeking out
of his tiny mouth?

41:46.851 --> 41:48.842
I didn't get
the chance to kill him.

41:48.886 --> 41:50.820
He'd left Yankton
by the time I got there,

41:50.855 --> 41:52.379
and I figured
I'd catch him here.

41:52.423 --> 41:54.015
Maybe you're here
to implement

41:54.058 --> 41:55.855
his fucking intentions
against me...

41:55.893 --> 41:57.758
I guess you chew
at it awhile,

41:57.795 --> 42:00.059
you could work out
how it could be that way.

42:00.097 --> 42:02.930
Having given me time
as he has to escape my angry mood,

42:02.967 --> 42:06.027
if I continue to ignore
his fucking extortions.

42:06.070 --> 42:07.697
Is that how you
left it with him?

42:07.738 --> 42:09.706
He's coming back here
to see you?

42:09.740 --> 42:12.231
Give you time to make up which side
you're on, Adams.

42:15.646 --> 42:18.706
If the cocksucker
would ever show up.

42:36.267 --> 42:40.260
For that which I do,
I allow not for...

42:41.505 --> 42:44.497
what I would that
I do not, for-

42:44.542 --> 42:46.203
Get out.

42:46.244 --> 42:50.908
But what I hate,
that, too, I-

42:53.985 --> 42:55.350
Now,

42:55.386 --> 42:58.480
if I would do
what I would not,

42:58.522 --> 43:01.116
it is no more
I that do it,

43:01.158 --> 43:04.491
but sin that
dwelleth in me.

43:06.497 --> 43:08.021
Johnny.

43:11.335 --> 43:14.133
Shut the door.

43:17.408 --> 43:20.377
If I was a more
adaptable primate

43:20.411 --> 43:23.346
or one of your
regular petitioners,

43:23.381 --> 43:26.111
I suspect I wouldn't
feeI this pain.

43:26.150 --> 43:27.981
I guess I-

43:28.019 --> 43:30.544
I'd have a wad of cartilage
covering the patella,

43:30.588 --> 43:32.317
protecting me
from this-

43:34.058 --> 43:37.858
this discomfort.

43:37.895 --> 43:40.420
Jesus Christ.

43:41.999 --> 43:44.991
Jesus Christ,

43:45.036 --> 43:48.699
just please, God,

43:48.739 --> 43:52.004
take that minister.

43:52.043 --> 43:54.637
What conceivable

43:54.679 --> 43:57.546
godly use

43:57.581 --> 44:00.982
is his protracted
suffering to you?

44:01.018 --> 44:04.613
What conceivable
godly use?

44:04.655 --> 44:07.317
What conceivable godly use

44:07.358 --> 44:10.725
was the screaming
of all those men?

44:10.761 --> 44:14.128
Did you- did you need to hear
their death agonies

44:14.165 --> 44:17.464
to know your-your-
your omnipotence?

44:19.136 --> 44:22.594
"Mama!"
"Mother, find my arm!"

44:22.640 --> 44:24.733
"Mommy!

44:24.775 --> 44:26.106
Mommy!

44:26.143 --> 44:27.804
Mommy!"

44:27.845 --> 44:31.645
"They- they shot
my leg off!"

44:31.682 --> 44:34.378
"It hurts so bad.

44:34.418 --> 44:38.047
It hurts so bad. "

44:44.295 --> 44:47.458
Admitting my understanding's
imperfection,

44:47.498 --> 44:50.934
trusting that
You have a purpose,

44:50.968 --> 44:54.404
praying that
You consider it served,

44:54.438 --> 44:58.841
I beg You to relent.

44:58.876 --> 45:02.539
Thy will be done, amen.

45:03.547 --> 45:07.142
- Oh, oh, oh-
- Shhh.

45:08.719 --> 45:11.244
Shhh.

45:21.766 --> 45:24.030
You want to be
a road agent?

45:24.068 --> 45:26.298
Deal out death
when called upon?

45:37.481 --> 45:39.608
Make a proper seal,

45:39.650 --> 45:42.346
stop up the breath,

45:42.386 --> 45:45.253
apply pressure
even and firm,

45:45.289 --> 45:48.258
like packing
a snowball.

45:53.330 --> 45:55.821
You can go now,
brother.

46:04.275 --> 46:06.402
Al...

46:06.444 --> 46:09.436
that-
magistrate's here.

46:09.480 --> 46:13.109
I got those other two guys
waiting upstairs.

46:14.485 --> 46:17.147
Join 'em.

46:25.930 --> 46:28.626
Get the sled
for him, huh?

46:59.063 --> 47:01.031
Things are
in the saddle, Al.

47:01.065 --> 47:03.056
Tell me what you mean
upstairs, huh?

47:12.476 --> 47:15.877
Adams your employee,

47:15.913 --> 47:18.905
and his butler.

47:22.653 --> 47:25.281
Yes, how are you,
Adams?

47:25.322 --> 47:28.314
I'm all right, sir.
We missed each other in Yankton.

47:28.359 --> 47:31.157
Yes, I was in the company
of General Crook.

47:31.195 --> 47:36.724
Adams bore you my message
to try fucking yourself.

47:36.767 --> 47:39.167
And here he is
in your office.

47:39.203 --> 47:41.694
Well, I figured
I'd catch up with you here.

47:41.739 --> 47:46.199
Do you no longer
serve his interests,

47:46.243 --> 47:48.711
is what he seems
to wonder.

47:48.746 --> 47:52.113
Adams, for his part,
is stone-featured,

47:52.149 --> 47:53.878
steeled in his purpose.

47:53.918 --> 47:58.184
- Which he'd be...
- Wherever his allegiance may lay.

48:04.361 --> 48:06.454
Well, be that
as it may, Magistrate,

48:06.497 --> 48:09.955
living as we all do
in doubt, please proceed.

48:12.203 --> 48:14.831
General Crook's
at the point of making a decision

48:14.872 --> 48:17.602
whether to garrison
some number of soldiers here

48:17.641 --> 48:20.804
or to leave the camp
to find its own way.

48:20.844 --> 48:24.007
I understand your strong
preference in this regard.

48:24.048 --> 48:27.575
You must understand
that for whatever reason

48:27.618 --> 48:30.143
General Crook has
come to trust me

48:30.187 --> 48:34.647
and rely on my counseI
exclusively.

48:34.692 --> 48:38.150
The appropriate gesture
made by you toward me

48:38.195 --> 48:40.595
would lead me
to dissuade the general

48:40.631 --> 48:42.565
from the garrison option,

48:42.600 --> 48:45.091
as well as clear away
from above

48:45.135 --> 48:47.296
the cloud
of uncertainty

48:47.338 --> 48:50.205
regarding your
personal liabilities,

48:50.241 --> 48:52.368
namely the incident
in Chicago.

48:52.409 --> 48:55.776
You have the document
of inquiry from Chicago?

48:55.813 --> 48:58.043
The murder warrant.
Yes, Al, I do.

48:58.082 --> 49:00.107
- On your person?
- Yes.

49:00.150 --> 49:01.913
Make the appropriate gesture,

49:01.952 --> 49:03.977
and the constable hand
of the past

49:04.021 --> 49:06.012
will no longer
weigh upon you.

49:07.391 --> 49:10.622
What man couldn't
that be said about?

49:33.484 --> 49:35.475
I'll be happy
to give you this paper

49:35.519 --> 49:37.510
when you take that
fucking gun off me.

49:44.695 --> 49:46.686
Both of them.

49:53.570 --> 49:55.538
Swaddle the cocksucker
and dispose of him.

49:55.572 --> 49:57.164
His money
and effects are yours.

49:57.207 --> 49:59.368
That don't count
towards the 2,000.

49:59.410 --> 50:01.776
No, I still
owe you the two.

50:34.912 --> 50:38.177
Crook's troops
are mustering.

50:38.215 --> 50:40.979
I didn't think your father would have
to traveI so soon.

50:41.018 --> 50:44.249
I don't begrudge him
an uncomfortable journey.

50:48.525 --> 50:50.493
I'll see him secured.

50:50.527 --> 50:52.586
And after that,
he's on his own.

50:59.203 --> 51:03.139
Doc! Doc!

51:03.173 --> 51:06.040
It's here-
your competition.

51:06.076 --> 51:09.876
Or is that one of
your fucking heresies?

51:17.154 --> 51:18.815
He passed.

51:22.459 --> 51:25.053
Lemme help you
bring him inside.

51:25.095 --> 51:27.063
A wily
cocksucker, huh?

51:27.097 --> 51:30.157
Waited till I got him
off the sled, huh?

51:31.168 --> 51:33.602
I would have let him
lay in state,

51:33.637 --> 51:35.229
but I need the room
for my whores.

51:35.272 --> 51:37.672
Thanks for seeing
him through.

51:39.343 --> 51:42.642
Are you gonna probe in his noggin
now to see what went amiss?

51:42.679 --> 51:45.204
No, not tonight.

51:45.249 --> 51:48.912
Tonight, I plan
to drink in.

51:51.388 --> 51:53.948
Announcing your plans

51:53.991 --> 51:57.256
is a good way to hear
God laugh.

52:34.698 --> 52:37.792
I told him, but we ain't had time to act
on your request yet.

52:37.835 --> 52:39.359
Yeah, I know.

52:39.403 --> 52:41.394
It's been
a busy night.

52:47.277 --> 52:50.440
- Bullock, what is it?
- We need to talk.

52:50.481 --> 52:52.642
Right.
Yeah, okay.

52:52.683 --> 52:56.710
Doc, I'm gonna be
a few minutes, huh?

52:57.855 --> 53:00.289
See this man gets
his shine, huh?

53:01.792 --> 53:04.386
Come on.

53:04.428 --> 53:06.692
Hi, Doc.

53:06.730 --> 53:08.755
How you doing?

53:08.799 --> 53:10.960
No stiffness
or numbness.

53:12.636 --> 53:15.867
Uh, let me see you
move around a bit.

53:22.813 --> 53:25.077
That'll give you
a shine.

53:26.850 --> 53:28.579
How do I look?

53:28.619 --> 53:31.179
How do you feeI's
the goddamn question.

53:31.221 --> 53:34.190
I feeI good.

53:34.224 --> 53:35.782
Well, good.

53:35.826 --> 53:39.023
Hey, Doc.
Give me a whirI.

53:40.797 --> 53:42.321
No, no.

53:42.366 --> 53:43.890
Come on,
I'll teach you how.

53:43.934 --> 53:48.530
No, no, no, no, no, no.
No, I won't, um- No.

53:53.343 --> 53:55.971
There's a blood stain
on your floor.

53:56.013 --> 53:58.880
Yeah, I'm...
I'm gonna get to that.

54:00.617 --> 54:04.519
Crook's forces
in full retreat.

54:04.555 --> 54:06.785
Taking Mrs. Garret's
father with 'em.

54:06.823 --> 54:08.984
Up and about
so quick.

54:09.026 --> 54:12.757
- He's slung over a mule.
- Alive, is my point.

54:12.796 --> 54:14.821
Dority give me
to understand

54:14.865 --> 54:17.060
you'd just as soon
as seen him dead.

54:20.837 --> 54:23.601
If that man comes
back to the camp,

54:23.640 --> 54:25.608
he'd be my problem
to deal with.

54:25.642 --> 54:28.076
The way you and Hickok
dealt with Ned Mason.

54:28.111 --> 54:30.636
No.

54:33.016 --> 54:35.143
I'll be
the fucking sheriff.

54:35.185 --> 54:38.086
Starting when?

54:38.121 --> 54:40.419
Starting now.

54:40.457 --> 54:43.187
- You have the tin?
- I do.

54:43.226 --> 54:45.660
Produce it.

54:51.468 --> 54:54.198
On the tit.

54:54.237 --> 54:56.637
I know where it goes.

55:10.020 --> 55:12.511
Huzzah.

56:05.375 --> 56:08.867
Hey, General!
You son of a bitch!

56:11.214 --> 56:13.341
Wow-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh!

56:13.383 --> 56:15.908
Wooh!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

56:23.193 --> 56:26.219
You know, I've never spoken to her
once since she come to camp.

56:26.263 --> 56:29.027
You reckon that's another reason
not to kill her old man,

56:29.066 --> 56:32.365
besides whatever's going on
between the two of you.

56:37.541 --> 56:39.532
Yeah.

56:43.413 --> 56:48.316
Anyways, Sheriff,

56:48.351 --> 56:52.447
I'm gonna walk past that blood stain
that mysteriously appeared

56:52.489 --> 56:55.458
and go oversee
my business interests.

56:55.492 --> 56:57.483
Take your time.

57:44.007 --> 57:48.467
Say "I'm as nimble
as a forest creature. "

57:48.512 --> 57:51.447
You're as nimble
as a forest creature.

57:51.481 --> 57:55.542
No, say it
about yourself.

57:55.585 --> 57:59.214
I'm as nimble
as a forest creature.

58:54.077 --> 59:00.983
& When we see Jesus,
coming in glory &

59:01.017 --> 59:07.388
& When He comes from
His home in the sky &

59:07.424 --> 59:15.058
& Then we shall meet Him
in that bright mansion &

59:15.098 --> 59:21.230
& We'll understand it all,
by and by &

59:21.271 --> 59:28.507
& Farther along
we will know all about it &

59:28.545 --> 59:35.451
& Farther along we will
understand why &

59:35.485 --> 59:42.254
& Cheer up, my brother,
live in the sunshine &

59:42.292 --> 59:48.231
& We'll understand it all
by and by. &
