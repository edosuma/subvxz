WEBVTT

00:01.440 --> 00:02.793
Previously on Stargate Atlantis.

00:02.880 --> 00:03.869
Ara, Rakai!

00:07.160 --> 00:09.116
Me, Rakai, Ara, we're your friends.

00:09.200 --> 00:10.189
You belong with us.

00:10.280 --> 00:11.554
You want to hit a Wraith lab?

00:11.640 --> 00:14.074
Having a ship would make things a
whole lot easier getting us in and out

00:14.160 --> 00:15.912
before any reinforcements arrive.

00:16.000 --> 00:17.319
We'll go this way. You go that way.

00:17.400 --> 00:19.755
Contact us if you find anything.

00:19.840 --> 00:21.637
Thank God, it's you three.

00:21.720 --> 00:22.869
You're Wraith worshippers?

00:22.960 --> 00:23.949
What did they do to you?

00:24.040 --> 00:26.918
They rewarded us with the
gift of everlasting life.

00:27.000 --> 00:28.831
- Rakai, no!
- No weapons.

00:30.240 --> 00:31.468
Run, and get away while you can,

00:31.560 --> 00:34.597
because the next time we meet,
it will not be as friends.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.878
You getting any sleep these
days? Not much, I'm afraid.

00:42.960 --> 00:44.313
Although things are a little easier

00:44.400 --> 00:45.913
now that Kanaan's
request has been granted

00:46.000 --> 00:48.355
and he's been allowed to
return from the mainland.

00:48.440 --> 00:50.078
How's he liking life in the big city?

00:50.160 --> 00:52.037
Well, he's happy to be
reunited with Torren and I,

00:52.120 --> 00:55.032
but he's having difficulty
adjusting to life on Atlantis.

00:56.480 --> 00:57.959
Yeah, I hear the shower scared him.

00:58.040 --> 01:01.271
And you once stunned Dr. Gero at
your own surprise birthday party.

01:01.360 --> 01:02.588
He spooked me.

01:02.680 --> 01:03.669
Uh-huh.

01:04.319 --> 01:06.276
It's difficult for Kanaan.

01:06.960 --> 01:10.873
He has Torren and me, of course,
but I still think he feels isolated.

01:11.320 --> 01:13.754
Yeah, well, he just needs
to make some new friends.

01:13.840 --> 01:15.353
You should get him to
come by the gym some time.

01:15.480 --> 01:17.198
- We could spar.
- Thank you.

01:17.280 --> 01:19.157
That's very kind of you,
but I need him in one piece

01:19.240 --> 01:20.559
for the foreseeable future.

01:20.640 --> 01:21.755
You're no fun.

01:23.200 --> 01:24.519
Hey, hey.

01:27.080 --> 01:28.069
Hey!

01:28.960 --> 01:30.075
Ronon!

01:32.000 --> 01:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:39.520 --> 01:40.555
Tyre.

02:43.280 --> 02:46.590
The Daedalus confirms the results
of your preliminary search.

02:46.680 --> 02:51.037
There's no sign of Ronon's subcutaneous
transmitter anywhere on that planet.

02:51.120 --> 02:53.156
That means he's still alive.

02:53.240 --> 02:55.959
If Tyre wanted him dead,
we would have found a body.

02:56.040 --> 02:59.510
Unless he just took him
somewhere to exact a slow revenge.

03:00.320 --> 03:01.833
I don't mean to sound overly negative,

03:01.920 --> 03:04.559
but from what I've heard,
his mind is seriously warped.

03:04.640 --> 03:06.232
And yet he didn't kill me.

03:06.320 --> 03:08.754
It would have been safer for
him to leave no witnesses.

03:08.840 --> 03:11.115
So perhaps, despite what
the Wraith did to him,

03:11.200 --> 03:13.760
Tyre still possesses his
Satedan sense of honor.

03:13.840 --> 03:15.512
It didn't stop him from ambushing you.

03:15.600 --> 03:19.479
We can use that Satedan sense
of honor to help us find Ronon.

03:19.560 --> 03:20.959
How do you propose we do that?

03:21.040 --> 03:22.393
We get a Satedan to help us.

03:22.480 --> 03:24.994
You happen to have one handy, do you?

03:25.440 --> 03:26.998
Teyla knows where one is.

03:27.080 --> 03:29.196
- Solen Sincha.
-Who?

03:29.280 --> 03:31.396
He is a survivor of the
Wraith attack on Sateda.

03:31.480 --> 03:32.469
Ronon and I encountered him

03:32.560 --> 03:34.391
on a trade mission to
Belkan two years ago.

03:34.480 --> 03:35.833
Judging by your
description, he isn't exactly

03:35.920 --> 03:37.353
the settle-down kind of guy.

03:37.440 --> 03:38.873
I mean, what are the chances
he's still gonna be there?

03:38.960 --> 03:41.190
There's only one way to find out.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.753
Mr. Woolsey, permission to go offworld?

03:56.160 --> 03:57.957
- You have a go.
- Great.

03:58.360 --> 03:59.759
And, Teyla,

04:00.640 --> 04:03.313
will you be accompanying
Colonel Sheppard and Dr. McKay?

04:03.400 --> 04:04.913
I only ask because I've yet to receive

04:05.000 --> 04:07.195
your formal request to
return to active duty.

04:07.280 --> 04:09.430
Of course she'll be returning. Right?

04:09.520 --> 04:13.035
I've yet to make a decision
about my future with the team.

04:13.200 --> 04:14.189
Oh.

04:15.120 --> 04:16.189
Okay.

04:16.959 --> 04:18.029
However, I would still like to accompany

04:18.120 --> 04:20.588
Colonel Sheppard and
Dr. McKay to Belkan.

04:20.680 --> 04:21.908
Of course.

04:52.760 --> 04:53.909
Teyla!

04:55.800 --> 04:57.313
Where's Teyla?

04:57.400 --> 05:00.676
I left her back on the planet.
Don't worry, she's fine.

05:01.120 --> 05:03.236
You know I wouldn't hurt her.

05:03.960 --> 05:05.029
Do I?

05:05.640 --> 05:08.154
I accept the fact that
you no longer trust me,

05:08.240 --> 05:10.879
but I'm hoping that will change in time.

05:11.400 --> 05:12.879
Sateda is gone.

05:13.880 --> 05:18.431
We're the last of our kind,
Ronon. We're brothers, not enemies.

05:18.760 --> 05:20.193
We're brothers?

05:21.400 --> 05:24.836
So I should just forgive you
for setting me up last year?

05:25.640 --> 05:29.758
If you had just listened to reason,
things could have been different.

05:30.440 --> 05:32.829
Ara and Rakai would still be alive,

05:32.920 --> 05:34.512
and we'd all be working together again.

05:34.600 --> 05:37.876
As Wraith worshippers and
traitors to the memory of Sateda?

05:37.960 --> 05:39.188
Hell, no.

05:39.720 --> 05:42.871
Of course not. I see that now.

05:42.960 --> 05:44.837
You're blinded by the past,

05:44.920 --> 05:47.639
lied to by your so-called
friends on Atlantis.

05:49.080 --> 05:51.833
But I still have faith
in you, old friend.

05:52.200 --> 05:55.078
You just need to open
your eyes to the truth.

05:55.800 --> 05:57.074
All right.

05:58.560 --> 06:01.870
Just untie me, and I'll
listen to what you have to say.

06:04.760 --> 06:08.833
Would that be before or after
you try to beat me unconscious?

06:08.920 --> 06:11.036
I don't know. You choose.

06:12.360 --> 06:14.510
Or I could just surprise you.

06:15.200 --> 06:16.189
I don't doubt it.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.831
What's wrong with you?

06:23.680 --> 06:25.113
I'm not well.

06:26.400 --> 06:28.118
But I've been worse.

06:29.240 --> 06:31.037
You know where we are?

06:33.000 --> 06:35.389
You remember Sarif Sur, don't you?

06:35.880 --> 06:37.233
Yeah. You almost died on that run.

06:37.320 --> 06:40.869
We both nearly died because
you refused to leave me behind.

06:44.800 --> 06:47.075
You risked your life to save me.

06:52.840 --> 06:54.034
Today

06:56.320 --> 06:57.992
I return the favor.

07:08.920 --> 07:09.955
Solen Sincha.

07:11.120 --> 07:13.873
Go away. Can't you see
I'm trying to sleep?

07:21.640 --> 07:24.359
- We need your help.
- Ronon Dex is in trouble.

07:24.440 --> 07:25.998
Ronon Dex is always in trouble.

07:26.080 --> 07:27.798
Well, his life is in danger.

07:27.880 --> 07:30.030
Again! What else is new?

07:31.880 --> 07:34.269
What kind of trouble has he
gotten himself into this time?

07:34.360 --> 07:38.751
He was abducted by a fellow Satedan, a
Wraith worshipper by the name of Tyre.

07:42.040 --> 07:44.349
You mean former Wraith worshipper.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.595
Word is, the dog disappointed his
masters, so they turned him loose.

07:48.680 --> 07:50.636
That's uncharacteristically
kind of them.

07:50.720 --> 07:51.948
Not exactly.

07:52.040 --> 07:55.635
So long as he's on the run,
he's a living, breathing example

07:55.720 --> 07:58.188
of what happens to humans
who disappoint them.

07:58.280 --> 07:59.713
Tyre's a marked man now.

07:59.800 --> 08:01.472
Most anyone I know
would kill him on sight.

08:01.560 --> 08:03.073
It's just a matter of time.

08:03.160 --> 08:06.311
He was once a proud
Satedan, not unlike yourself.

08:06.400 --> 08:09.153
He was subjected to unimaginable
torture. Perhaps he had no choice.

08:09.240 --> 08:10.753
There is always a choice.

08:10.840 --> 08:13.673
He could have chosen
death like a true Satedan.

08:13.760 --> 08:16.274
Any idea where we can find him?

08:16.360 --> 08:18.874
If I knew that, he'd already be dead.

08:20.680 --> 08:21.795
All right.

08:21.880 --> 08:24.440
- Tyre's not thinking straight, right?
- Sure.

08:24.520 --> 08:26.511
So it's probably just a matter
of time before he slips up.

08:26.600 --> 08:30.275
And when he does, I'm assuming
your leads will hear about it.

08:30.920 --> 08:31.955
- Probably.
- So what do you say

08:32.039 --> 08:34.429
you contact us when you hear something?

08:34.520 --> 08:37.239
We'll deal with Tyre
and save you the trip.

08:40.840 --> 08:42.114
All right.

08:43.799 --> 08:45.028
To Ronon.

08:49.560 --> 08:52.358
Look at you. You can barely walk.

08:53.800 --> 08:55.916
Let me get you some help.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.718
I'm beyond your help.

09:00.400 --> 09:04.029
It's the Wraith, isn't
it? What they do to you?

09:05.560 --> 09:06.959
At this point,

09:07.040 --> 09:11.079
it's not so much what they did to
me as what they aren't doing to me.

09:11.160 --> 09:14.152
Giving you life? Reverse-feeding
or whatever the hell it's called?

09:14.240 --> 09:16.071
It's hard to describe.

09:16.160 --> 09:18.674
The sense of euphoria it offers is...

09:22.480 --> 09:23.549
You became addicted to it.

09:23.640 --> 09:26.837
You can't understand it unless
you've experienced it yourself.

09:26.920 --> 09:28.353
It was a gift,

09:29.200 --> 09:32.556
one that was denied me after I allowed
you and your friends to escape us.

09:34.120 --> 09:36.759
Free me, I'll get you some help.

09:36.840 --> 09:38.353
I promise.

09:38.440 --> 09:40.476
Help is already on the way.

09:40.960 --> 09:42.313
For both of us.

09:42.400 --> 09:44.118
What does that mean?

09:47.000 --> 09:48.956
What the hell did you do?

09:56.760 --> 09:58.193
I've saved us.

10:07.080 --> 10:09.071
Ronon Dex.

10:09.160 --> 10:12.755
I looked forward to the day
when you would finally serve me.

10:12.920 --> 10:15.229
Well, then, I'm gonna feel
real bad disappointing you.

10:15.320 --> 10:16.992
I'm sure you'll try.

10:17.720 --> 10:20.951
But in the end, you'll come around.

10:26.280 --> 10:27.633
Mr. Woolsey.

10:28.200 --> 10:30.316
Teyla, any news on Ronon?

10:30.960 --> 10:32.712
- Not yet.
- I'm sorry.

10:34.480 --> 10:38.758
I suppose we can draw comfort from
the fact that he is a proven survivor.

10:39.080 --> 10:41.992
He defied the odds for
many years as a runner.

10:42.520 --> 10:43.919
Yes, he did.

10:46.160 --> 10:47.832
How can I help you?

10:47.920 --> 10:50.912
I wanted to apologize for
not having come to you sooner

10:51.000 --> 10:54.356
with a decision regarding my
position on the colonel's team.

10:54.440 --> 10:56.112
Take whatever time you need.

10:56.200 --> 10:59.749
If necessary, I can assign
someone to fill in for you.

11:01.720 --> 11:02.709
Oh...

11:03.880 --> 11:06.235
Mr. Woolsey, do you have children?

11:06.320 --> 11:07.958
No.

11:08.040 --> 11:10.600
But I did have a Yorkie for many years.

11:11.880 --> 11:14.110
It's a small dog.

11:14.280 --> 11:15.269
Ah.

11:16.360 --> 11:18.794
But my wife got him in the divorce.

11:21.600 --> 11:23.192
I loved that dog.

11:24.160 --> 11:26.993
I never really had the
chance to say goodbye.

11:28.160 --> 11:30.594
So, no. No children.

11:31.520 --> 11:33.033
Then, with all due respect,

11:33.120 --> 11:36.271
you may not understand how
difficult this is for me.

11:39.160 --> 11:40.912
For most of my life,

11:41.000 --> 11:44.310
I never imagined the
possibility of leaving my people,

11:44.400 --> 11:46.391
not even for a moment.

11:46.480 --> 11:49.677
And then circumstances changed.

11:51.040 --> 11:53.349
And after realizing a
far more important role

11:53.440 --> 11:54.714
on Colonel Sheppard's team,

11:54.800 --> 11:58.793
I never imagined the day would
come when I would have to let it go.

11:59.760 --> 12:01.716
And now here that day is.

12:03.600 --> 12:05.670
Five years ago, if anyone had asked me

12:05.760 --> 12:09.514
if I ever planned on taking a
job outside of the Milky Way,

12:09.600 --> 12:11.875
my answer would have been a definite no.

12:11.960 --> 12:13.188
And now...

12:14.440 --> 12:15.759
Look at me.

12:16.080 --> 12:17.195
So,

12:17.920 --> 12:21.435
while I can't empathize,

12:23.240 --> 12:25.196
I certainly do sympathize.

12:26.360 --> 12:29.158
Believe me, I know priorities change.

12:33.240 --> 12:35.151
And sometimes they don't.

12:38.560 --> 12:41.393
Teyla, I'm sure Kanaan will support you

12:42.840 --> 12:44.876
whatever decision you make.

12:45.800 --> 12:47.631
Yes. Of course he will.

12:48.720 --> 12:50.597
Thank you, Mr. Woolsey.

13:08.280 --> 13:10.475
How does it feel to
have your life stolen?

13:10.560 --> 13:15.031
To be pushed so close to the darkness,
only to be pulled back from the brink?

13:15.480 --> 13:17.357
From what I understand,

13:18.480 --> 13:20.630
it's a magnificent sensation.

13:20.720 --> 13:24.235
To be honest, I've felt better.

13:25.280 --> 13:29.717
Defy me all you want. Your
fellow Satedans were no different.

13:29.800 --> 13:33.190
Like them, you will eventually submit.

13:35.640 --> 13:37.312
I'll die before I submit.

13:37.400 --> 13:40.119
No, you won't.

13:50.680 --> 13:53.194
Hey. You're up early.

13:53.280 --> 13:54.713
It's 10:00 a. m.

13:55.120 --> 13:56.155
It is?

13:56.240 --> 13:57.229
Oh, God.

13:57.320 --> 14:01.757
I didn't sleep at all. I was up all
night thinking about this Ronon situation.

14:01.840 --> 14:04.400
- You got anything?
- Nothing. I tried everything,

14:04.480 --> 14:06.471
pacing, snacking, bathing.

14:07.160 --> 14:10.311
- Bathing.
-  Yeah. Like Archimedes.

14:10.400 --> 14:12.356
You mean that Greek scientist
who had a crush on Teyla?

14:12.440 --> 14:13.429
No, like the Greek mathematician

14:13.520 --> 14:14.953
who came up with the
Archimedes Principle,

14:15.040 --> 14:16.553
the physical laws of buoyancy.

14:16.640 --> 14:21.316
According to legend, the idea came to
him when he was sitting in the bath, so...

14:21.680 --> 14:26.151
Look, the point is that the revelation
occurred while he was relaxing,

14:26.240 --> 14:27.229
not thinking about the problem.

14:27.320 --> 14:29.709
And the solution, as it turns out,
was right in front of him all along.

14:29.800 --> 14:30.835
You think we've overlooked something?

14:30.920 --> 14:32.558
I don't know. Maybe.

14:32.640 --> 14:34.756
Look, all I know is I was
up all night going over it

14:34.840 --> 14:38.435
and I'm drawing a blank, so I
could use a fresh perspective.

14:38.960 --> 14:40.518
I'm not taking a bath with you.

14:40.600 --> 14:42.750
Let's just go over what we know.

14:42.840 --> 14:45.354
According to Solen, Tyre's on the run.

14:45.720 --> 14:47.278
Now, we can assume he's operating alone,

14:47.360 --> 14:50.636
because if he had backup, they
would have been in on the ambush.

14:50.720 --> 14:53.234
Right. He's alone with Ronon on the run.

14:53.320 --> 14:55.151
So where would someone like that go?

14:55.240 --> 14:56.389
Well, I can think of something like

14:56.480 --> 14:58.710
200 uninhabited planets
that would be perfect.

14:58.800 --> 15:01.360
- Where do you want to start?
- How about Sarif Sur?

15:01.440 --> 15:02.429
- What?
- We just got a message

15:02.520 --> 15:03.748
from Ronon's buddy, Solen.

15:03.840 --> 15:07.992
He hears that Tyre and Ronon are
holed up on a planet called Sarif Sur.

15:08.320 --> 15:09.514
Thank you, Archimedes.

15:09.600 --> 15:10.953
Major, get your team and gear up.

15:11.040 --> 15:12.234
Yes, sir.

15:13.800 --> 15:18.237
There's just no point in holding on.
You're just putting off the inevitable.

15:19.280 --> 15:22.556
It's better if you just accept it.

15:24.480 --> 15:26.914
You mean better for you, don't you?

15:30.200 --> 15:33.715
The Wraith cut you off and
this is your way back in,

15:35.760 --> 15:37.990
by offering me up as sacrifice.

15:41.680 --> 15:42.669
No.

15:45.600 --> 15:48.239
You're not the man I risked my life for.

15:49.560 --> 15:52.393
You are a traitor to
the memory of our people.

15:54.840 --> 15:56.432
You have no honor.

15:59.120 --> 16:02.829
Things are progressing too slowly.
I have other matters to attend to.

16:02.920 --> 16:05.753
We can continue this
process back at the lab.

16:07.400 --> 16:09.516
And when will I receive my reward?

16:10.800 --> 16:12.199
Your reward?

16:14.360 --> 16:15.952
I brought him here as we agreed.

16:16.040 --> 16:19.191
In exchange, you promised to
restore our previous arrangement.

16:19.280 --> 16:22.590
- Did I?
- You promised!

16:28.360 --> 16:33.593
I'm afraid I'm going to have to disappoint,
since your usefulness has come to an end.

16:48.440 --> 16:49.919
We'll get him.

16:50.640 --> 16:52.596
See that you do, colonel.

17:12.839 --> 17:13.829
Nothing.

17:15.040 --> 17:18.510
So we were wrong. It
has been known to happen.

17:18.599 --> 17:20.829
Hey, I always said this was a long shot.

17:20.920 --> 17:23.275
Colonel, this is Lorne.
We've got something.

17:23.359 --> 17:24.588
I knew it.

17:29.240 --> 17:30.559
Over here.

17:37.640 --> 17:38.959
We checked his pulse.

17:39.040 --> 17:41.031
It's barely there. We gotta
move him or we lose him.

17:41.120 --> 17:43.270
- Where's Ronon?
- Good question.

17:49.800 --> 17:51.028
His injuries are minor,

17:51.120 --> 17:54.476
but both his heart rate and
blood pressure are elevated.

17:55.040 --> 17:57.634
He woke up about an hour
after you brought him in.

17:57.720 --> 18:02.271
He was delirious. He was
sweating, nauseous, trembling,

18:02.360 --> 18:05.909
so I sedated him and ran some tests.

18:07.040 --> 18:09.952
After giving him a drug
that blocks opioid receptors,

18:10.040 --> 18:13.316
I noticed a drop in
dopamine levels here.

18:13.400 --> 18:16.278
A central link in the
brain's reward circuit.

18:16.360 --> 18:18.191
Right. Meaning?

18:18.280 --> 18:21.238
Meaning this type of
neurochemical activity is identical

18:21.320 --> 18:23.788
to that of reforming substance-users.

18:24.880 --> 18:27.030
He's going through withdrawal.

18:28.960 --> 18:31.520
I need you to save him, Doc.
Right now, he's our only lead.

18:31.600 --> 18:34.034
If he dies, our chances of
finding Ronon go with him.

18:34.120 --> 18:35.439
Of course. But it could be days

18:35.520 --> 18:38.512
before he's coherent
enough to tell us anything.

18:38.600 --> 18:39.953
John!

18:40.040 --> 18:43.476
Why wasn't I informed about
the mission to rescue Ronon?

18:45.240 --> 18:48.198
We were playing on a
hunch. We had to act fast.

18:48.760 --> 18:50.751
I'm going to go see if
they're still serving lunch.

18:50.840 --> 18:51.989
It's Taquito Tuesday.

18:52.080 --> 18:53.877
I think I'll join you.

18:54.640 --> 18:58.758
I'm surprised that you would be so
quick to move forward without me.

18:58.840 --> 19:00.592
Don't put this on me.

19:00.800 --> 19:03.155
You're the one having second
thoughts about returning to the team.

19:03.240 --> 19:07.518
I cannot give you the option
every time we're going offworld.

19:07.600 --> 19:09.636
This is not an easy decision for me.

19:09.720 --> 19:11.711
You think you're the
only one feeling pressure?

19:11.800 --> 19:15.349
I've got Woolsey pushing me hard
to find a replacement for you.

19:15.440 --> 19:16.589
- What did you tell him?
- I told him

19:16.680 --> 19:18.398
that I wasn't going to do
anything until I talked to you.

19:18.480 --> 19:22.553
Now, if you want to join the team, great.
I'll call Woolsey. I'll make it happen.

19:22.640 --> 19:25.393
But if you want to spend time
with your son, I understand. I do.

19:25.480 --> 19:26.833
I really do.

19:27.440 --> 19:29.590
You gotta make a decision.

19:37.520 --> 19:39.272
You're finally awake.

19:39.880 --> 19:42.314
The procedure can be very taxing.

19:42.400 --> 19:45.631
You've been unconscious for
the better part of a day.

19:46.640 --> 19:48.596
You're wasting your time.

19:49.400 --> 19:53.313
I'll die before I turn,
just like Marika and Hemi.

19:55.960 --> 19:57.916
I'm afraid you're mistaken.

19:58.000 --> 20:01.072
Your friends didn't die
because they were strong.

20:01.560 --> 20:05.109
They died because they were too
weak to withstand the process.

20:05.200 --> 20:08.875
Their minds and bodies eventually
shut down under the strain.

20:10.080 --> 20:11.399
But you...

20:13.800 --> 20:15.313
You're stronger.

20:16.920 --> 20:21.152
And it is your strength
that will prove your undoing.

20:28.560 --> 20:31.199
He broke through his restraints
this morning and injured two guards,

20:31.280 --> 20:34.590
so I thought it would be
best to put him in isolation.

20:34.840 --> 20:36.512
At least this way if
he breaks free again,

20:36.600 --> 20:39.273
he won't be an immediate
danger to anyone.

20:39.360 --> 20:41.590
How long is it going to
take him to go through this?

20:41.680 --> 20:44.148
To be honest, I'm not even sure he will.

20:44.240 --> 20:47.789
Please! You're killing me! Please!

20:48.120 --> 20:50.076
Can't you give him
something for the pain?

20:50.160 --> 20:51.639
Sedatives will make
him more comfortable,

20:51.720 --> 20:54.678
but they'll also slow down his recovery.

20:54.760 --> 20:58.036
I want this to go as quick
as possible. No sedatives.

21:59.080 --> 22:00.911
He's already sleeping?

22:04.640 --> 22:07.313
Why does it take so much longer
when I try to put him down?

22:07.400 --> 22:09.072
You worry too much.

22:09.640 --> 22:11.870
Perhaps he senses your anxiety.

22:14.040 --> 22:17.350
Maybe he prefers the comfort
of his mother's presence.

22:21.240 --> 22:25.153
Well, there may be times when he
will have to learn to do without.

22:29.080 --> 22:31.469
Does that mean you've decided?

22:31.560 --> 22:33.039
I thought so.

22:34.440 --> 22:36.556
How can I return to the
team with the knowledge

22:36.640 --> 22:38.039
that every time I step through the gate,

22:38.120 --> 22:40.918
there is a chance that
I might not come back?

22:41.120 --> 22:43.998
That given the dangers,
there's a possibility

22:44.080 --> 22:46.799
that our son will grow
up without a mother?

22:50.560 --> 22:52.915
You have a responsibility to him.

22:55.840 --> 22:59.674
But you also have a responsibility
to the people of this galaxy.

23:02.280 --> 23:05.078
Follow your heart without remorse.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.956
And take comfort in knowing
that you'll be doing so

23:08.040 --> 23:10.315
to safeguard the future of many,

23:12.600 --> 23:14.318
including your son.

23:16.200 --> 23:18.998
Just promise me you'll
be careful out there.

23:20.160 --> 23:22.720
He's been awake and lucid
for about 10 minutes now.

23:22.800 --> 23:24.028
What did he say?

23:24.120 --> 23:26.509
Only that he wanted to talk to you.

23:33.080 --> 23:35.435
I know where they've taken Ronon.

23:35.520 --> 23:36.873
Can you give us a gate address?

23:36.960 --> 23:39.599
Better. I'll lead you right
into the heart of the facility.

23:39.680 --> 23:41.238
Well, you're still recovering.

23:41.320 --> 23:43.231
Dr. Keller told me there
were no longer any traces

23:43.320 --> 23:44.753
of the Wraith enzyme in my system.

23:44.840 --> 23:47.434
- That's not the point.
- Colonel, please.

23:47.960 --> 23:50.190
Let me help you get Ronon back.

23:55.320 --> 24:00.474
No retreat in the face of battle.
No sympathy for the fallen.

24:01.200 --> 24:03.509
No mercy for our enemies.

24:05.960 --> 24:10.078
No retreat in the face of battle.
No sympathy for the fallen.

24:10.760 --> 24:13.194
And no mercy to your enemies.

24:13.280 --> 24:15.396
Our enemies.

24:17.520 --> 24:18.714
Atlantis.

24:24.720 --> 24:25.948
Atlantis.

24:27.600 --> 24:28.828
No mercy.

24:37.320 --> 24:39.629
He seems rational, says
he wants to help us.

24:39.720 --> 24:42.029
I say we trust him only
as much as we have to.

24:42.120 --> 24:44.759
Use his intel, but he
stays here, under guard.

24:44.840 --> 24:46.193
If you want to hit that Wraith facility,

24:46.280 --> 24:47.599
we're gonna need all
the help we can get,

24:47.680 --> 24:49.272
and apparently he knows
that place inside and out.

24:49.360 --> 24:52.158
Yes, and is thus in the perfect
position to lead you right into a trap.

24:52.240 --> 24:54.993
All right, look. I think as much
as he'd like us to believe it,

24:55.080 --> 24:57.719
this is not about
regaining some lost honor

24:57.800 --> 24:59.392
or some Satedan revenge thing.

24:59.480 --> 25:01.198
Pure and simple, this
is about a desperate guy

25:01.280 --> 25:02.838
who's willing to do
anything to help his buddy.

25:02.920 --> 25:04.717
And how can you be so
certain of that, Colonel?

25:04.800 --> 25:06.677
Because I've been there.

25:07.200 --> 25:09.555
Now, we have a chance to get
Ronon, and I'm gonna take it,

25:09.640 --> 25:12.438
and you're gonna need
to trust me on this.

25:12.520 --> 25:13.839
All right.

25:14.200 --> 25:16.156
Major Lorne's team will
be accompanying you.

25:16.240 --> 25:17.309
What is it? What's happening?

25:17.400 --> 25:18.992
We know where Ronon is.

25:19.080 --> 25:20.877
- I'm coming with you.
- Gear up.

25:20.960 --> 25:23.076
Teyla, this is exactly the
kind of decision we were...

25:23.160 --> 25:25.879
I was just about to meet
Kanaan in the cafeteria.

25:25.960 --> 25:28.269
Would you please explain
to him the situation?

25:28.360 --> 25:29.395
- It's all right.
- You... You...

25:29.480 --> 25:30.674
Please.

25:30.760 --> 25:32.034
All right.

25:36.200 --> 25:38.953
Well, well, well, who have we here?

25:40.200 --> 25:42.919
Cafeteria. Cafeteria.

25:56.720 --> 25:57.948
This way.

26:10.120 --> 26:11.917
What is this place?

26:12.000 --> 26:13.069
You were looking for a target area

26:13.160 --> 26:15.310
that would maximize the
effects of your explosives.

26:15.400 --> 26:18.631
Well, this is it, the
facility's power relay chamber.

26:20.640 --> 26:23.154
Hide your charges to avoid discovery.

26:23.360 --> 26:24.588
Let's go.

26:34.880 --> 26:37.189
I assume you have a means to remote
detonate from a safe distance?

26:37.280 --> 26:40.955
Yeah. Just flip... Click.

26:46.240 --> 26:47.468
This way.

27:19.600 --> 27:21.511
- Ronon.
-Sheppard.

27:21.600 --> 27:23.113
It's about time.

27:23.760 --> 27:25.751
What's going on, buddy?

27:25.840 --> 27:28.912
We were beginning to wonder
if you'd ever show up.

27:30.400 --> 27:32.470
You're at a disadvantage.

27:32.560 --> 27:33.549
You can attempt an escape,

27:33.640 --> 27:37.076
but you'll have to sacrifice
your friend's life to do so.

27:38.520 --> 27:40.397
Ronon, get out of the way.

27:40.480 --> 27:41.993
I can't do that.

27:43.200 --> 27:45.156
Ronon, step aside.

27:50.880 --> 27:53.314
His life wouldn't be
the only one forfeited.

27:53.400 --> 27:54.549
Tyre.

27:55.160 --> 27:56.878
Lower your weapons.

28:00.920 --> 28:02.114
Take them away.

28:02.200 --> 28:04.236
Ronon, what's happening here?

28:04.760 --> 28:05.909
Ronon!

28:20.280 --> 28:23.352
I assume this is a
prize worthy of reward?

28:23.440 --> 28:24.873
Welcome back.

28:32.560 --> 28:34.039
Well, you know, on the bright side,

28:34.120 --> 28:35.633
at least we'll never have
to go back to Atlantis

28:35.720 --> 28:37.392
and hear Woolsey say, "I told you so. "

28:37.480 --> 28:38.629
We're gonna get out of here.

28:38.720 --> 28:41.314
Oh, sure. I mean, all we have to
do is escape from this cell, right?

28:41.400 --> 28:45.188
Then get past all of the armed
Wraith that are guarding the facility

28:45.280 --> 28:47.475
and free Lorne and his team
from wherever they're being held

28:47.560 --> 28:50.074
to get back to the Jumper, which is
probably being disassembled as we speak,

28:50.160 --> 28:52.071
and, right, of course,
we've got to rescue Ronon,

28:52.160 --> 28:54.515
who, I don't know if you happened to
notice or not, isn't quite himself.

28:54.600 --> 28:57.876
We're gonna get Ronon and
we're gonna go back to Atlantis.

28:57.960 --> 29:00.235
And even if we do, then what, huh?

29:00.320 --> 29:02.959
I mean, Tyre's recovery
hasn't exactly been

29:03.040 --> 29:04.678
the rousing success we were hoping for.

29:04.760 --> 29:08.116
We're going to get Ronon back.

29:10.800 --> 29:12.358
Yeah. Of course.

29:19.400 --> 29:21.436
We're gonna get him back.

29:24.080 --> 29:26.674
You waste a huge
opportunity by killing them.

29:26.760 --> 29:30.275
They have no use to me beyond
the information they can provide.

29:30.360 --> 29:31.839
You underestimate their value.

29:31.920 --> 29:35.799
Is it their value I underestimate,
or your loyalty I overestimate?

29:35.880 --> 29:36.869
Ronon's right.

29:36.960 --> 29:40.270
They're much more useful to
you alive and cooperative.

29:40.800 --> 29:43.030
They just need some convincing.

29:46.160 --> 29:47.752
All right, I got it.

29:47.840 --> 29:49.558
We tell them we have
some vital information

29:49.640 --> 29:52.108
that we're willing to give up, but
we will only share it with Ronon.

29:52.200 --> 29:55.909
So they send Ronon, he
shows up, we appeal to him...

29:56.000 --> 29:58.594
I mean, the part of
him that's still him.

29:58.680 --> 30:02.275
Well, I can only think of three
things wrong with that plan, but go on.

30:02.360 --> 30:03.839
He hasn't been brainwashed
as long as Tyre,

30:03.920 --> 30:06.036
which means he might be more
susceptible to our influence.

30:06.120 --> 30:08.156
We convince him to let us
out or lead us out of here,

30:08.240 --> 30:10.390
and then, worst-case scenario,
he's not entirely convinced...

30:10.480 --> 30:12.357
That's your worst-case scenario?

30:12.440 --> 30:13.429
Hey, I'm just spinning here,

30:13.520 --> 30:16.080
but, you know, we could take
advantage of that moment of uncertainty

30:16.160 --> 30:17.991
- and...
-Sheppard.

30:21.880 --> 30:23.632
You've been summoned.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.468
You want to go over
the plan one more time?

30:26.560 --> 30:28.471
No. No, I think I'm good.

30:29.200 --> 30:32.078
I guess it's my turn
for the sales pitch, huh?

30:45.720 --> 30:48.075
Wait. We need to get something.

31:07.440 --> 31:08.509
Kneel.

31:08.600 --> 31:10.477
You know what would be
really creepy and unexpected,

31:10.560 --> 31:12.437
is if you knelt instead.

31:15.440 --> 31:16.589
God!

31:16.840 --> 31:18.193
I guess not.

31:20.280 --> 31:22.748
All right, I'll try to make it work.

31:23.360 --> 31:25.669
I appreciate your defiance.

31:25.880 --> 31:29.156
Ronon, I really need you
to snap out of it about now.

31:29.560 --> 31:33.075
It will make turning you
all the more enjoyable.

32:15.160 --> 32:17.196
Teyla! McKay! How'd you get out?

32:17.280 --> 32:20.238
- Tyre freed us. Let's go.
- Okay, come on, guys.

32:51.000 --> 32:52.353
Go, go, go!

32:54.040 --> 32:56.190
- How's it going?
- Not so good!

33:03.400 --> 33:05.391
My guys are holding them
off, but not for much longer.

33:05.480 --> 33:06.959
Give me that.

33:09.160 --> 33:10.513
Tell them to back off.

33:10.600 --> 33:16.948
My life will be a small price to pay
for the lives of you and your team.

33:20.480 --> 33:23.472
Then how about the
destruction of this facility?

33:23.560 --> 33:25.994
Is that a small enough price as well?

33:26.080 --> 33:27.354
You lie.

33:27.440 --> 33:29.908
I told them where to hide the
charges for maximum effect,

33:30.000 --> 33:32.753
enough explosives to destroy
this place and all its research.

33:32.840 --> 33:35.752
Any advantage your hive may
hold over its rivals will be gone

33:35.840 --> 33:37.831
with the push of a button.

33:41.320 --> 33:42.389
Wait!

33:55.080 --> 33:57.150
Tell them to let us through.

33:58.320 --> 34:01.596
What's to stop you from triggering
the explosives from a safe distance?

34:01.680 --> 34:03.238
My presence here.

34:07.800 --> 34:09.949
You let them go. I'll remain behind.

34:10.040 --> 34:12.270
- Tyre...
- Once they've reached the gate,

34:12.360 --> 34:15.079
I'll trade you this
device for my freedom.

34:17.520 --> 34:19.397
Or we all die together.

34:24.199 --> 34:25.553
Let them go.

34:39.600 --> 34:41.556
I'll be right behind you.

34:47.040 --> 34:48.268
Let's go.

35:12.920 --> 35:15.912
You turn your back
on an incredible gift?

35:16.520 --> 35:19.557
Actually, you turned
your back on me first.

35:19.640 --> 35:21.358
And I thank you for it.

35:21.440 --> 35:22.793
We're clear.

35:23.560 --> 35:25.710
You are not beyond forgiveness.

35:27.080 --> 35:29.036
It's not too late for you.

35:29.400 --> 35:30.833
Yes, it is.

35:31.720 --> 35:33.199
For both of us.

35:52.760 --> 35:55.593
What kind of a time frame for
recovery are we looking at?

35:55.680 --> 35:57.398
It's impossible to predict.

35:57.480 --> 35:59.152
He has so much of the
enzyme running through him

35:59.240 --> 36:01.674
that his body can hardly process it.

36:02.440 --> 36:05.716
When it eventually does,
that's when he'll come down,

36:06.680 --> 36:08.636
and he'll come down hard.

36:08.720 --> 36:10.597
I'm gonna talk to him.

36:15.280 --> 36:16.508
Open it.

36:20.400 --> 36:21.799
There he is.

36:23.720 --> 36:25.950
- Hey, buddy.
- Buddy.

36:26.920 --> 36:30.390
So, how long are you planning
on keeping me prisoner?

36:30.480 --> 36:32.436
As long as it takes to clear your head.

36:32.520 --> 36:35.432
- My head is clear.
- Well, you may be feeling fine right now,

36:35.520 --> 36:38.592
but things are gonna
get pretty rough for you.

36:38.880 --> 36:41.314
We're gonna get you through this.

36:41.600 --> 36:44.114
Whatever you got planned,
it's not gonna work.

36:44.200 --> 36:45.679
You got a choice,

36:45.760 --> 36:48.558
you either kill me or you let me go.

36:48.640 --> 36:49.629
And if you let me go,

36:49.720 --> 36:52.837
I promise I won't come
after you or Atlantis.

36:53.960 --> 36:55.313
You can tell Tyre I won't
come after him either.

36:55.400 --> 36:56.753
Tyre's dead.

36:58.600 --> 37:01.592
He sacrificed himself
taking out the Wraith lab.

37:02.600 --> 37:03.715
Yeah, well, he was a traitor.

37:03.800 --> 37:05.950
No, he was a good friend.

37:06.040 --> 37:07.393
We all are.

37:09.760 --> 37:12.194
You're gonna realize that pretty soon.

37:12.280 --> 37:14.236
Yeah, well, you just
kill me or set me free.

37:14.320 --> 37:15.548
Sheppard!

37:15.640 --> 37:17.756
You kill me or set me free!

37:17.840 --> 37:19.432
Sheppard!

37:29.480 --> 37:31.710
Kill me please!

37:32.120 --> 37:34.395
Please kill me!

37:34.720 --> 37:35.709
No!

38:05.840 --> 38:09.628
I had what they called
piano fingers, slim, nimble.

38:09.720 --> 38:12.393
Well, it's really no surprise that
my parents signed me up for lessons.

38:12.480 --> 38:15.278
My first teacher, of course,
hailed me as a natural.

38:15.400 --> 38:18.119
Big Russian woman,
Polanski or Baranski or...

38:18.200 --> 38:20.430
- Sheppard.
- Definitely a "ski. "

38:22.280 --> 38:23.429
Ronon?

38:24.440 --> 38:25.429
Hey,

38:26.040 --> 38:27.598
how do you feel?

38:30.320 --> 38:32.072
Like hitting someone.

38:33.760 --> 38:35.512
Anyone in particular?

38:36.960 --> 38:40.509
You, if you don't loosen these
straps and get me something to eat.

38:40.600 --> 38:43.239
That is a good sign. That's a good sign!

38:44.200 --> 38:46.077
He's back! He's back!

38:47.720 --> 38:49.517
So he's fully recovered?

38:49.600 --> 38:51.716
Well, physically he's still weak,

38:51.800 --> 38:54.598
but his blood work shows no
traces of the enzyme in his system,

38:54.680 --> 38:58.195
so he should be back to
his old self in no time.

38:59.400 --> 39:01.914
Good to hear. Well, it's late.

39:02.000 --> 39:03.149
I think I'll head back to my quarters

39:03.240 --> 39:05.356
and change into something
a little more relaxed.

39:05.440 --> 39:06.759
Good night.

39:11.080 --> 39:12.991
John, may I have a word?

39:13.440 --> 39:14.759
Yeah. Sure.

39:21.680 --> 39:23.272
Teyla, come in.

39:26.720 --> 39:30.599
I thought you said you were
changing into something more relaxed.

39:31.920 --> 39:34.275
For me, this is more relaxed.

39:34.360 --> 39:36.669
- Can I offer you a drink?
- No, thank you.

39:36.760 --> 39:40.435
I just spoke with John, and now
I would like to make it official.

39:40.520 --> 39:42.556
I'm requesting a return to active duty.

39:42.640 --> 39:46.269
I would like to resume my position
on Colonel Sheppard's team.

39:46.360 --> 39:48.351
You're sure this is what you want?

39:48.440 --> 39:49.873
Very much so.

39:49.960 --> 39:51.871
Well, then, welcome back.

39:52.440 --> 39:54.271
Thank you, Mr. Woolsey.

39:54.360 --> 39:56.271
- Good night.
- Good night.
