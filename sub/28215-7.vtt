00:01.539 --> 00:03.248
All right, sit down, everybody.

00:03.273 --> 00:05.164
Start to shut up. I...

00:07.000 --> 00:13.074

00:19.474 --> 00:21.674
A little history lesson for you.

00:21.676 --> 00:24.577
Thousands and thousands
of people have died

00:24.579 --> 00:26.012
trying to climb Mount Everest,

00:26.014 --> 00:28.415
but I refuse to give
my life to that bitch.

00:28.417 --> 00:30.417
- Hmm.
- Oh, no!

00:30.419 --> 00:32.076
Did I swear again?

00:32.101 --> 00:34.715
Sometimes your only friend
is the howling of the wind.

00:34.740 --> 00:35.955
Is that Greg Miller?

00:35.957 --> 00:37.424
You actually liking this?

00:37.426 --> 00:39.325
Yas, queen. Get right.

00:39.327 --> 00:41.027
He had his frostbit toe amputated.

00:41.029 --> 00:42.829
Mm-hmm, on the side of a dang mountain.

00:42.831 --> 00:45.330
With a steak knife. Get right, queen.

00:45.355 --> 00:46.644
What?

00:46.669 --> 00:49.730
Anyway, my buddy Iceman,
he hands me my severed toe.

00:49.887 --> 00:51.291
It's dripping with blood.

00:51.316 --> 00:52.839
And I... I whisper to her.

00:52.841 --> 00:55.875
I say, "One day, you and me, girl,

00:55.877 --> 00:58.034
we are gonna climb to the summit."

00:58.059 --> 00:59.074
And guess what, folks?

00:59.099 --> 01:01.758
Three years later, that's
exactly what we did!

01:03.718 --> 01:07.041
Now, I've got a special guest
here I wanna introduce you to.

01:07.823 --> 01:08.823
Oh!

01:10.358 --> 01:13.021
Guess what's in here? My big toe.

01:13.046 --> 01:14.060
Here she is.

01:14.363 --> 01:16.263
This toe means everything to me.

01:16.288 --> 01:17.654
Weird.

01:17.679 --> 01:20.569
It reminds me that
nothing's gonna stop my ass.

01:21.140 --> 01:22.615
Whitlock, you wanna see this toe?

01:22.640 --> 01:23.643
No.

01:23.645 --> 01:25.378
Huh?

01:25.380 --> 01:27.280
I'm afraid you're gonna have to earn it.

01:27.590 --> 01:30.619
Now, Greg is gonna be here
all week helping each of you

01:30.644 --> 01:32.088
achieve a personal goal.

01:32.113 --> 01:35.187
- Your own personal Everest.
- Ooh.

01:35.189 --> 01:38.048
And so to all the losers out there,

01:38.073 --> 01:42.295
all the weak, bullied,
people that look in the mirror

01:42.297 --> 01:43.657
and don't like what they see...

01:45.900 --> 01:48.057
I was you. We're gonna get there.

01:48.303 --> 01:51.688
And on Friday when you summit,
I'm gonna show you the toe!

01:53.207 --> 01:57.743
I was defeated, but now
I am "vic-toe-rious."

01:59.681 --> 02:02.373
Stop it, stop it, stop it!
This guy sucks.

02:02.401 --> 02:03.634
Are you crazy? Don't block my clap.

02:03.636 --> 02:04.700
Yes, he's the worst.

02:07.179 --> 02:09.583
Yeah!

02:22.215 --> 02:24.454
All right, everyone
sit down and shut up.

02:24.456 --> 02:26.365
There will be no Everesting
in this class, okay?

02:26.390 --> 02:28.551
And anyone who plays this
dumb Neanderthal's game

02:28.576 --> 02:29.626
gets an immediate F.

02:29.628 --> 02:31.349
You don't think it's
impressive that he climbed

02:31.373 --> 02:33.360
the world's tallest
mountain with only nine toes?

02:33.365 --> 02:34.369
Uh, you know what, Sarika?

02:34.393 --> 02:35.814
No, I don't think it's impressive.

02:35.839 --> 02:37.330
Actually, I find it a little bit easier.

02:37.354 --> 02:38.596
Did you guys realize
that Everest isn't even

02:38.620 --> 02:39.728
the hardest Himalayan peak?

02:39.753 --> 02:42.097
That's probably why he picked it.
You know, 'cause K2 is way harder.

02:42.121 --> 02:44.084
Actually, he did K2 last year.

02:44.109 --> 02:46.610
Did he? Damn it, did he, though?

02:46.612 --> 02:48.111
- Did he?
- Yeah.

02:48.113 --> 02:49.314
And whose side are you guys on, anyway?

02:49.338 --> 02:50.514
M... Mine or Greg's?

02:50.516 --> 02:52.141
- Greg's.
- Greg's?

02:52.952 --> 02:54.451
All right, give me the
shirts, you patsies.

02:54.453 --> 02:55.625
They're going in the dump.

02:55.650 --> 02:57.851
Oh, jeez, are we out of bananas?

02:58.572 --> 02:59.823
Oh, sorry, Dave.

03:00.096 --> 03:01.925
Ah, it's fine.

03:01.927 --> 03:03.927
Wait, why did you say sorry?

03:03.929 --> 03:05.929
Do you think a man would apologize

03:05.931 --> 03:07.664
for taking the last community banana?

03:07.666 --> 03:10.000
Women apologize way more.

03:10.002 --> 03:12.102
Our Everest should be
the mountain of sexism

03:12.104 --> 03:14.258
- we face every damn day.
- Yes.

03:14.283 --> 03:15.526
Preach.

03:15.551 --> 03:17.617
You know, I've got to stop saying sorry.

03:18.010 --> 03:19.376
That's gonna be my Everest.

03:19.401 --> 03:20.677
Preach it.

03:20.679 --> 03:23.121
I'm sick of yielding
to every man whenever

03:23.146 --> 03:24.548
I walk down the hallway.

03:24.550 --> 03:27.692
No more getting stuck in
between the vending machines

03:27.717 --> 03:29.119
waiting for the hallway to clear out.

03:30.189 --> 03:31.559
I never yield.

03:31.584 --> 03:34.519
I'm like a bull in a glass plate shop.

03:34.544 --> 03:37.372
- China shop?
- I try to be woke.

03:38.230 --> 03:39.563
Racially.

03:39.565 --> 03:40.950
Okay.

03:40.975 --> 03:44.923
- Oh, no more bananas, huh?
- Oh, sorry, Ralph...

03:44.948 --> 03:47.566
- Do not now.
- I... I ate the last...

03:47.591 --> 03:48.691
You better stop.

03:49.742 --> 03:52.242
- Take an apple, bitch.
- Okay, let's...

03:52.244 --> 03:54.711
guys, let's remember to be respectful.

03:54.713 --> 03:58.148
Uh, we are not guys. We are ladies.

03:58.150 --> 04:00.651
I'm just gonna cut my losses here.

04:00.653 --> 04:02.252
You know what? Y'all inspire me.

04:02.254 --> 04:05.022
As strong women, we need
to take care of ourselves.

04:05.024 --> 04:06.864
The last time I truly spoiled myself

04:06.889 --> 04:08.325
was at Sandals Resort, Jamaica.

04:08.327 --> 04:11.028
And if I cannot go there,
it's got to come to me.

04:11.030 --> 04:12.996
That's my Everest, me.

04:12.998 --> 04:14.667
You know, I'm tired of the inequality

04:14.692 --> 04:17.166
and women making way less than men.

04:17.168 --> 04:20.202
Oh, I mean, I'm even more way less,

04:20.204 --> 04:22.239
'cause I haven't had
a raise in 15 years.

04:22.241 --> 04:24.675
Excuse me? That's a no.

04:24.677 --> 04:27.229
- You have got to demand a raise.
- I do?

04:27.254 --> 04:29.063
- Yeah.
- Yes, you go, girl.

04:29.088 --> 04:30.280
I'm fired up already.

04:30.282 --> 04:32.616
- Go get you it, baby.
- Hop off that sofa.

04:32.618 --> 04:34.742
I gotta rock it. I gotta rock it up.

04:34.767 --> 04:35.919
Pop off it.

04:44.452 --> 04:46.907
Jack? Jack Griffin.

04:46.932 --> 04:48.098
It's Greg Miller.

04:48.100 --> 04:50.133
Uh, wow. Have we met?

04:50.135 --> 04:52.627
Uh, yeah. I used to call you
Pimple Butt Jack.

04:52.652 --> 04:54.738
Remember that? "PBJ, PBJ?"

04:54.740 --> 04:56.767
Uh, that's... that is not my name.

04:56.792 --> 04:58.135
Well, I heard you blew it at Harvard

04:58.159 --> 04:59.479
and had to move back home.

04:59.504 --> 05:02.118
Meanwhile, I'm raking it
in convincing these losers

05:02.143 --> 05:03.282
that they're winners.

05:03.307 --> 05:07.105
Joke is, they are losers,
just like you, Pimple Butt.

05:07.130 --> 05:08.151
Yeah.

05:08.153 --> 05:09.819
You know, it's funny, you
kinda sound like an idiot

05:09.843 --> 05:11.366
right now 'cause I don't
have pimples on my butt.

05:11.390 --> 05:13.160
That was a lie you
made up in tenth grade.

05:13.185 --> 05:15.418
Oh, so what do you want to do,
prove it to me by showing me your butt?

05:15.442 --> 05:16.464
I don't think so.

05:16.489 --> 05:17.490
I don't wanna show you my butt.

05:17.514 --> 05:19.162
I'm gonna go wash up somewhere else.

05:19.164 --> 05:20.397
- I didn't say that.
- That's not my scene.

05:20.399 --> 05:21.592
- What are you...
- Bye-bye.

05:36.048 --> 05:37.914
You know, if you tell
anybody about this...

05:37.916 --> 05:39.850
I know, I get an F.

05:39.852 --> 05:41.118
No, no, no, no.

05:43.088 --> 05:44.154
You get a murder.

05:51.826 --> 05:52.942
You can do this.

06:04.780 --> 06:06.279
Wh... Whoa, excuse me.

06:06.281 --> 06:08.148
I... I'm actually... I'm... I...

06:09.818 --> 06:11.351
Yeah, okay.

06:11.353 --> 06:12.519
Right.

06:12.521 --> 06:13.687
Excuse me.

06:14.281 --> 06:17.204
Can I just... can I...
can you... I had... my...

06:18.216 --> 06:20.193
You know what? This actually works out.

06:24.032 --> 06:25.365
I'm worried about Mr. Griffin.

06:25.367 --> 06:27.227
Why? He's always late.

06:30.839 --> 06:32.660
Guys, Mr. Griffin is
hiding from his bully.

06:32.685 --> 06:34.324
That Everest dude called him Pimple Butt

06:34.349 --> 06:35.442
when they went to Whitlock.

06:35.467 --> 06:37.433
He almost made Mr. Griffin
cry in the bathroom,

06:37.458 --> 06:38.812
- and I felt so bad...
- Damn it!

06:38.814 --> 06:40.880
Vic... Victor, what did I say, man?

06:42.033 --> 06:43.491
Your rage makes more sense now.

06:43.516 --> 06:44.516
Mm-hmm.

06:44.541 --> 06:46.886
- You were a nerd too.
- No, stop, okay?

06:46.888 --> 06:48.709
Everybody just chill out.
I wasn't bullied.

06:48.734 --> 06:49.912
I wasn't a nerd.

06:49.937 --> 06:51.558
This isn't one of those
things where you guys find out,

06:51.560 --> 06:53.393
"Oh, Mr. Griffin's just like me."

06:53.395 --> 06:55.028
Lots of us are in denial too.

06:55.030 --> 06:56.201
Guys, stop, okay?

06:56.226 --> 06:57.874
I hate Greg because he's a liar.

06:57.899 --> 06:59.132
It's as simple as that, okay?

06:59.157 --> 07:01.234
He... he constantly
spread lies in high school.

07:01.236 --> 07:03.741
- About your pimple butt?
- No, not about my pimple butt.

07:03.766 --> 07:06.406
I don't have a p... guys,
there's no pimples on my butt.

07:06.408 --> 07:07.874
There never were.

07:08.304 --> 07:09.521
Look, the guy's a liar.

07:09.546 --> 07:11.244
He was lying then, and
I bet you he's lying now.

07:11.246 --> 07:12.846
I bet you he didn't even climb Everest.

07:12.848 --> 07:14.981
And you know what? I'm gonna prove it.

07:14.983 --> 07:18.084
We're gonna help you, Chief,
because you were bullied.

07:18.086 --> 07:20.854
Okay, well then don't help,
because I wasn't, all right?

07:20.856 --> 07:22.856
If you want to help, help
because you hate Greg.

07:22.858 --> 07:25.646
What if we don't say why we're helping?

07:28.063 --> 07:29.897
Yeah, all right, fine.
That's good enough.

07:30.999 --> 07:34.434
Well, I was the most popular
donor there at the clinic,

07:34.436 --> 07:37.103
so, you know, the
odds of these lovebirds

07:37.105 --> 07:39.023
being related is very high.

07:39.704 --> 07:41.170
Oh, I gotta call you back.

07:41.195 --> 07:42.728
You can't keep stalling.

07:42.753 --> 07:44.321
- It's go time, girl.
- Oh, no kidding.

07:44.346 --> 07:46.021
I gotta stop a wedding this weekend.

07:46.046 --> 07:48.079
No, Helen, it's time
to go get that money.

07:48.216 --> 07:49.582
- Let's go!
- Oh, not today.

07:49.584 --> 07:52.018
No, it's not a good time. No, no.

07:52.020 --> 07:54.287
- Cut the crap, Durb.
- What... what crap?

07:54.289 --> 07:56.122
You need to give Helen a raise.

07:56.124 --> 07:59.352
Oh, yes, ab... absolutely.
I would love to.

07:59.377 --> 08:00.502
Oh.

08:00.527 --> 08:03.120
Well, now, see, this is what
happens when strong women

08:03.145 --> 08:06.109
- come together.
- Yes, we cannot be stopped.

08:06.134 --> 08:07.901
- Let's go!
- Oh.

08:07.903 --> 08:09.202
Mm.

08:12.207 --> 08:14.407
I'd apologize, but
that was not my fault.

08:14.409 --> 08:16.123
That's was the dab's fault, Durb.

08:16.148 --> 08:18.379
- You gotta stop dabbing.
- But it's who I am.

08:18.404 --> 08:19.579
It's aggressive.

08:19.581 --> 08:21.275
You were woman, and we heard you roar.

08:22.355 --> 08:23.583
I don't want a raise.

08:23.585 --> 08:26.144
The school needs the money
much more than I do.

08:26.169 --> 08:28.603
I just got all jacked up
because everyone was being

08:28.628 --> 08:32.258
all empowering and it was
fun, that's all, so disregard.

08:32.260 --> 08:34.494
I put the money aside every year.

08:34.496 --> 08:35.962
I want you to get this raise.

08:35.986 --> 08:38.855
Th... the students want
you to get this raise.

08:38.967 --> 08:40.900
My mother wants you to get this raise.

08:40.926 --> 08:42.893
Tell Debbie to mind her own business.

08:42.918 --> 08:45.419
Okay, well, Debbie Durbin
doesn't mind her own business,

08:45.507 --> 08:47.240
and neither does her son Dennis Durbin,

08:47.242 --> 08:49.609
and neither does Dennis' brother Ralph.

08:49.611 --> 08:53.446
So, Helen, take the GD raise.

08:54.493 --> 08:57.231
Okay, I'll take the raise...

08:58.019 --> 08:59.645
when I'm dead and stupid!

09:08.530 --> 09:11.030
I've got him. I have got him.

09:11.032 --> 09:13.032
So why don't you guys go
ahead and prepare to lift me

09:13.034 --> 09:15.635
on your bony little
shoulders in triumph?

09:15.637 --> 09:20.039
This is a manifest that I
received after a very long,

09:20.041 --> 09:22.423
very, very flirty
conversation with Ditya

09:22.448 --> 09:24.042
at the, uh, Nepalese embassy,

09:24.067 --> 09:25.645
and this shows every single person

09:25.647 --> 09:27.313
who climbed Everest in 2015.

09:27.315 --> 09:29.314
That's the year that
Greg supposedly summited.

09:29.339 --> 09:31.617
And guess what, my little cornichons?

09:32.303 --> 09:33.436
He's not on the list.

09:35.190 --> 09:36.190
He's a liar.

09:37.492 --> 09:40.226
You guys are staring at me.
What's going on?

09:40.228 --> 09:42.028
So we got all the yearbooks Greg was in,

09:42.030 --> 09:44.032
and you were right. He's a liar.

09:44.057 --> 09:46.743
He wasn't weak. He actually took
really good care of himself.

09:46.768 --> 09:47.861
Yep, he's a liar.

09:47.886 --> 09:49.969
You also said you weren't a nerd,

09:49.971 --> 09:54.040
and there's a lot of
evidence to the contrary.

09:54.042 --> 09:57.477
Uh, we saw that you were in band
and that you played oboe.

09:57.479 --> 09:59.746
- Uh-huh.
- I play oboe.

10:00.279 --> 10:01.748
We're o-bros.

10:01.750 --> 10:04.083
Also, we saw that your senior quote was,

10:04.085 --> 10:06.085
"All around the world,
statues crumble for me."

10:06.087 --> 10:08.488
We cross-referenced it
because we thought it was

10:08.490 --> 10:11.357
a quote from Julius
Caesar. But it's not.

10:11.752 --> 10:13.526
It's from a band called Sugar Ray.

10:13.888 --> 10:17.568
And, Mr. Griffin, they're not great.

10:18.099 --> 10:19.599
Yeah, no, I know, okay?

10:19.601 --> 10:22.039
But at the time, there
was this California sound.

10:22.064 --> 10:23.080
It was sweeping the na...

10:23.105 --> 10:25.055
I don't have to explain
myself to you two.

10:25.080 --> 10:26.861
The point is, I've got him.

10:27.709 --> 10:29.575
And over the course
of the next half hour,

10:29.577 --> 10:31.277
I'm gonna weave a web around him

10:31.279 --> 10:33.410
waiting for the perfect
moment to pounce.

10:34.382 --> 10:37.175
Toy with my prey.

10:37.200 --> 10:38.206
Howdy, hikers.

10:38.231 --> 10:39.527
I've got you! I've got you!

10:39.552 --> 10:40.559
I've got him! He's a liar!

10:40.583 --> 10:42.016
You're a liar, and I got ya!

10:43.757 --> 10:46.062
Read it and weep, sucker.

10:46.431 --> 10:48.747
It seems that no one named Greg Miller

10:48.772 --> 10:50.897
climbed Everest in 2015.

10:55.186 --> 10:57.184
Oh, PBJ.

10:58.017 --> 10:59.216
You wanna know the truth?

11:00.945 --> 11:04.213
After I lost my toe in my
first attempt to summit,

11:04.215 --> 11:07.375
I came home to months of
grueling physical therapy.

11:07.400 --> 11:09.567
For a toe? Come on, man.

11:10.588 --> 11:14.624
My beautiful, gorgeous
wife stood by my wobbly side

11:14.626 --> 11:16.782
as I recovered, and
out of that darkness,

11:17.173 --> 11:20.212
I decided to legally
change my last name to hers,

11:20.879 --> 11:23.547
Bouvier, so let me ask you,

11:23.935 --> 11:28.938
did a Greg Bouvier climb
Mount Everest in 2015?

11:30.508 --> 11:31.788
You take a look.

11:34.412 --> 11:36.479
- It checks out.
- Yeah, I bet it does.

11:36.481 --> 11:38.423
You know, those things
can easily be forged.

11:38.448 --> 11:41.350
And I... I bet you... I bet
you he never even lost a toe.

11:41.352 --> 11:42.419
Wow.

11:42.821 --> 11:44.832
I really didn't wanna do this but, uh,

11:45.181 --> 11:46.847
take a look.

11:47.238 --> 11:49.492
That's us approaching the Lhotse wall,

11:49.494 --> 11:50.793
bottom of Everest.

11:50.795 --> 11:53.028
And that is Iceman with the knife.

11:54.242 --> 11:58.309
And that's him screaming as
the knife cuts through the bone.

12:00.501 --> 12:03.134
Now, I never screamed. I didn't cry.

12:03.675 --> 12:06.275
I sure as hell didn't lie about my toe.

12:07.812 --> 12:10.346
Jackie, baby.

12:10.348 --> 12:12.949
You need professional help, my boy.

12:14.552 --> 12:16.385
And I'm the one that's
gonna give it to you.

12:16.387 --> 12:18.125
I just talked Durbin into hiring me

12:18.150 --> 12:20.723
for a three-day mandatory
employee seminar.

12:20.725 --> 12:22.384
That's the big bucks, boy.

12:23.525 --> 12:26.491
Ooh, I cannot wait to
get my hands on you,

12:27.936 --> 12:29.532
my little pimple butt.

12:31.736 --> 12:33.903
If you won the lottery
or "Price is Right"

12:33.905 --> 12:36.155
or "Wheel of Fortune,"
isn't there a prize

12:36.180 --> 12:37.539
you'd wanna win?

12:37.564 --> 12:40.520
I mean, there was a time I
was very jealous of a woman

12:40.545 --> 12:43.130
who won an impact-resistant
self-collapsing

12:43.155 --> 12:46.113
DuraGuard protected carry-on
collection from Visionair.

12:46.138 --> 12:48.899
Oh, Mama, that was traveling in style.

12:48.924 --> 12:49.924
That was sexy.

12:49.949 --> 12:53.745
Helen, you are worth more
than some luggage, okay?

12:53.770 --> 12:56.771
So please take this check.

13:00.398 --> 13:01.664
Hmm?

13:22.302 --> 13:24.247
This Sloppy Joe is gross.

13:24.272 --> 13:25.305
LeBron!

13:29.360 --> 13:31.838
Uh, hello.

13:32.532 --> 13:33.673
Hi, Dave.

13:34.047 --> 13:35.383
Dang it, Mary.

13:35.733 --> 13:38.334
I gotta go straight to my
son's christening after work.

13:39.874 --> 13:41.074
Stay strong.

13:43.107 --> 13:45.118
- Not my problem.
- Oh.

13:45.610 --> 13:47.492
Wow. Okay.

13:48.947 --> 13:50.446
Have a good day, Mary.

13:52.248 --> 13:54.827
That sucked. I'm shook.

13:55.273 --> 13:58.378
Climbing a mountain's hard,
girl, but gotta persevere.

14:01.392 --> 14:03.593
Mmm, hits me right in my teeth.

14:26.451 --> 14:28.918
♪ Bill collector called today ♪

14:30.355 --> 14:31.454
♪ Shove ♪

14:43.134 --> 14:44.901
♪ Get out of my... ♪

14:47.972 --> 14:50.207
Hey. Ralph.

14:51.282 --> 14:52.320
You okay, man?

14:53.144 --> 14:55.378
I miss the hummingbirds in winter, Jack.

14:55.961 --> 14:57.046
O... okay.

14:57.448 --> 15:00.850
Uh, listen, Greg Miller
is not who he says he is.

15:00.852 --> 15:02.018
This is a bad guy.

15:02.020 --> 15:03.636
I... I disagree, Jack.

15:04.022 --> 15:06.889
We went out for Shock Tops last night.

15:06.891 --> 15:08.658
I... I'd never heard of this beer.

15:08.660 --> 15:12.495
Have you seen their logo?
It's an orange with a Mohawk.

15:12.497 --> 15:15.239
I looked him up. His name is Wedgehead.

15:15.264 --> 15:17.223
Look, I've known Greg
for 20 years, okay?

15:17.248 --> 15:18.534
He is a liar.

15:18.536 --> 15:21.637
He showed me the toe last night.

15:21.639 --> 15:23.494
He was very vulnerable.

15:23.519 --> 15:26.174
I think if you saw it, you would
understand him on a deeper level.

15:26.713 --> 15:29.596
Maybe you would join us for Shock Tops.

15:29.621 --> 15:31.401
You know what? Thanks for nothing.

15:31.565 --> 15:32.715
I'll get someone else to help.

15:32.717 --> 15:34.583
And, by the way, just so you know,

15:34.934 --> 15:36.566
hummingbirds don't
migrate in the winter.

15:37.113 --> 15:38.207
They just die.

15:43.561 --> 15:47.596
Mr. Bouvier, we just wanna
apologize for yesterday.

15:47.598 --> 15:49.464
Well, I'm running late
for my closing assembly.

15:49.489 --> 15:51.022
Can you help me with my Everest?

15:51.047 --> 15:52.648
My dad always wanted
me to be good at tennis,

15:52.672 --> 15:55.977
but I'm afraid of the balls. Please?

15:56.606 --> 15:58.105
I don't wanna be weak anymore.

15:58.130 --> 15:59.997
So you guys finally came around.

16:00.078 --> 16:02.545
All right, climber, get
your ass to the trailhead.

16:02.547 --> 16:05.152
Let's do this. What you got?

16:06.918 --> 16:08.684
That is badass. All right, let her rip.

16:08.709 --> 16:10.586
Whoa, whoa, whoa, where
did you guys get that?

16:12.190 --> 16:14.690
Come on, stay with it! Whoo!

16:14.692 --> 16:15.958
- Ow!
- Come on, take it!

16:15.960 --> 16:17.441
What are you doing? Come on, Iceman.

16:17.466 --> 16:19.061
You got this.

16:19.063 --> 16:23.766
25,000 feet. 27,000 feet.

16:23.768 --> 16:26.102
29,000 feet. You did it!

16:26.104 --> 16:27.770
That's the summit, bro!

16:29.076 --> 16:30.917
Nice work, man. I was wrong about you.

16:30.942 --> 16:32.641
Oh, my gosh. That was awesome.

16:32.643 --> 16:36.191
- Oh, that was so cool.
- That is the system in action.

16:36.216 --> 16:38.014
Back-stabbing traitors.

16:42.228 --> 16:45.245
Wow. Wow.

16:45.270 --> 16:48.233
You know, and to think I was
just starting to like you guys,

16:48.258 --> 16:50.157
and here you are siding with a bully,

16:50.834 --> 16:51.953
the guy who used to tell everybody

16:51.977 --> 16:53.647
that I was still
breastfeeding on my mom,

16:53.875 --> 16:58.498
my hardworking single mother's boobies.

16:59.952 --> 17:01.833
Yeah, he used to... he used
to take little ketchup packets

17:01.835 --> 17:02.937
and he would put a little tear in it,

17:02.961 --> 17:05.061
put it on my chair so that
when I sat down, it exploded,

17:05.086 --> 17:07.204
and he'd be like, "Hey,
Jack just had his period.

17:07.230 --> 17:08.243
Check it out, everybody."

17:08.269 --> 17:10.069
And he'd call me Period Boy Jack,

17:10.094 --> 17:12.650
yeah, one of two PBJ nicknames.

17:13.422 --> 17:14.722
That's who you just sided with.

17:19.545 --> 17:20.740
You guys suck.

17:20.765 --> 17:23.766
Boss, the tennis balls were
just a distraction so that

17:23.790 --> 17:25.089
we could grab this.

17:25.952 --> 17:27.284
We got the toe.

17:27.794 --> 17:28.941
Oh.

17:29.996 --> 17:32.474
My babies.

17:32.499 --> 17:34.499
My beautiful, sweet babies.

17:34.524 --> 17:36.101
He's gonna freak out
when he realizes that

17:36.103 --> 17:37.177
this toe is missing.

17:37.202 --> 17:38.336
We gotta make it to that assembly.

17:38.338 --> 17:39.882
Come on, let's go.
I don't wanna miss this.

17:39.906 --> 17:41.226
This is really gross.

17:42.576 --> 17:43.975
Come on.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.368
I'm no stranger to adventure myself.

17:47.115 --> 17:49.415
When I was a gnat's butt older than you,

17:49.440 --> 17:52.609
I went on a class-five rapids expedition

17:52.633 --> 17:55.066
through the Appalachians
with my friend Gale.

17:55.422 --> 17:58.072
I had been trying to convince
her to do a gal's trip

17:58.097 --> 17:59.137
- in the wilderness...
- Hey, Greg.

17:59.139 --> 18:00.478
Hey, man, um, listen.

18:00.503 --> 18:02.259
I just wanted to apologize, uh,

18:02.284 --> 18:04.409
about what happened
the other day. I'm... I'm sorry.

18:04.411 --> 18:07.045
Oh, okay, well, I wanted
to tell you something too.

18:07.047 --> 18:08.909
I... I heard you lost your mom.

18:09.648 --> 18:10.815
Man, I'm sorry.

18:10.817 --> 18:12.017
Thank you.

18:12.019 --> 18:13.285
Bet you're starving.

18:14.755 --> 18:17.022
- Little baby needs his milk.
- Right.

18:19.193 --> 18:21.226
Now I gotta go inspire
these losers, so, uh,

18:21.228 --> 18:23.395
I forgive you. We're good.

18:23.397 --> 18:24.588
Good.

18:25.065 --> 18:27.932
And then the natives,
they served me the stew.

18:28.702 --> 18:31.508
And while I was eating...
'cause I was hungry...

18:32.206 --> 18:36.107
I kept asking, "Did you find
my friend Gale in the wreckage?"

18:36.109 --> 18:38.376
And suddenly I felt a bone in my mouth.

18:38.378 --> 18:39.912
And I understood.

18:40.714 --> 18:43.415
I had eaten my best friend.

18:46.119 --> 18:50.121
Well, without further ado,
let's welcome back Greg Miller.

18:52.671 --> 18:54.271
What's going on, Whitlock?

18:55.128 --> 18:57.696
Boy, we had some great
summits this week, didn't we?

18:57.698 --> 19:00.065
I'm so proud of you guys.
Show us the toe!

19:00.067 --> 19:01.967
Oh, you wanna jump to it, huh?

19:01.969 --> 19:03.676
I think you deserve it.

19:03.700 --> 19:05.925
- Yeah.
- Let's do this thing.

19:06.773 --> 19:09.407
She might be a little shy.
Let's see how it goes.

19:09.409 --> 19:10.705
You wanna come out and say hi?

19:13.069 --> 19:16.402
This little piggy went to Whitlo...

19:17.985 --> 19:19.451
My t... where's my toe?

19:19.453 --> 19:20.515
What the hell?

19:20.540 --> 19:22.319
- Somebody stole my toe!
- No, no, no, hey.

19:22.344 --> 19:23.699
I just saw it ten minutes ago.

19:23.724 --> 19:26.146
Whitlockians are not thieves.

19:26.171 --> 19:29.160
I'm gonna give everyone
a countdown from five

19:29.162 --> 19:31.331
to return the toe, okay? Counting down.

19:31.356 --> 19:34.612
Five, four... it's okay. Three...

19:34.637 --> 19:37.302
- It's not okay.
- Two, one.

19:38.105 --> 19:40.171
Okay, another five starting now.

19:40.173 --> 19:43.475
- Five, four...
- You dumb inbred dog turds!

19:43.477 --> 19:45.110
You're trying to rattle me?

19:45.112 --> 19:47.078
I climbed Everest, okay?

19:47.080 --> 19:48.747
You think you're
better than that, bitch?

19:48.749 --> 19:50.567
Your Everests were the
worst I've ever heard.

19:50.592 --> 19:52.723
You got "do more footbaths" over here.

19:52.748 --> 19:53.873
What the hell is that?

19:53.898 --> 19:56.131
And your quarterback has a broken leg.

19:56.156 --> 19:58.156
Okay, I don't know about
you, but I like quarterbacks

19:58.158 --> 20:01.826
who can actually run, not
walk around on crutches.

20:06.533 --> 20:08.239
My toe! My toe!

20:10.003 --> 20:11.336
Don't let the door hit you!

20:20.847 --> 20:23.782
You broke a bad, bad man
today, my little cherubs.

20:23.784 --> 20:25.934
We had to. He was your bully, boss.

20:25.959 --> 20:27.352
Mr. G, you know what?

20:27.354 --> 20:29.287
I feel one of our hugs coming on.

20:33.360 --> 20:35.060
Oh, what... what are
you guys doing there?

20:35.062 --> 20:36.495
Come on, this is just
a me-and-Anthony thing.

20:36.519 --> 20:38.196
Come on, guys.

20:38.198 --> 20:40.348
Ah, a lot of teenage smells happening.

20:44.589 --> 20:47.290
Helen Henry Demarcus, come on down.

20:47.574 --> 20:51.716
You've won the
impact-resistant self-collapsing

20:51.741 --> 20:55.480
DuraGuard-protected carry-on
collection from Visionair!

20:56.909 --> 21:00.051
Oh, but you can't touch
unless you agree to take

21:00.053 --> 21:01.923
the luggage and a raise.

21:01.948 --> 21:05.067
Oh, can I just have those
three beautiful little bags?

21:05.092 --> 21:06.097
Nope.

21:06.827 --> 21:09.027
