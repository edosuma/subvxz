WEBVTT

00:25.442 --> 00:27.902
Clear eyes, full tums, can't lose.

00:27.986 --> 00:29.988
Just so long as
after this hater goes down,

00:30.071 --> 00:31.865
we get back to the real task at hand.

00:31.948 --> 00:33.199
This is the real task at hand.

00:35.744 --> 00:37.454
Real small task is right.

00:37.787 --> 00:39.372
Friends, I promise tonight's job
will very much be

00:39.456 --> 00:41.541
in the spirit
of our revolutionary mission.

00:42.208 --> 00:43.585
Right. Now, let's sync up watches,

00:43.668 --> 00:46.296
so we can meet up you know where,
you know when.

00:47.881 --> 00:49.299
-See you on the other side.
- Mmm-hmm.

00:55.555 --> 00:57.557
Maybe a little snack first.

01:20.955 --> 01:21.915
Menagerie.

01:22.415 --> 01:23.875
Were you going after that nice lady?

01:24.292 --> 01:25.418
Girl's gotta eat.

01:32.050 --> 01:34.260
-Where are the Elite?
-Like I'd tell you.

01:34.344 --> 01:36.012
Tell us or eat this!

01:36.095 --> 01:37.806
Hey, Dreamer, easy.

01:37.889 --> 01:39.265
I thought that you said

01:39.349 --> 01:41.601
being a superhero was about
showing strength.

01:41.684 --> 01:44.312
Well, I meant more "hands on hips,"

01:44.395 --> 01:45.939
not "screaming in face."

01:47.232 --> 01:48.066
Gotcha.

01:48.441 --> 01:49.943
The Elite can't run forever.

01:50.026 --> 01:51.861
Tell us where they are
and we might go easy on you.

01:52.278 --> 01:53.905
If you touch one scale on my body,

01:53.988 --> 01:57.033
my friends might transport you
to a Fifth Dimension of pain.

01:59.160 --> 02:00.161
Last chance.

02:02.038 --> 02:03.373
Where is Manchester?

02:06.209 --> 02:08.294
It is with great humility

02:08.795 --> 02:11.464
that I accept
this presidential appointment

02:11.548 --> 02:14.676
as your new Director
of the Bureau of Alien Affairs.

02:15.093 --> 02:17.762
This appointment will signal
the dawning of a new day.

02:17.846 --> 02:21.975
A day in which human beings
need no longer live in fear

02:22.058 --> 02:24.853
of aliens or their random acts of--

02:32.527 --> 02:34.445
Say cheers to my little friend.

02:35.071 --> 02:36.239
How's it looking out there?

02:40.952 --> 02:41.786
Supergirl.
You saved our lives.

02:44.873 --> 02:45.707
There!

02:48.793 --> 02:49.711
Time to go, mate.

02:49.794 --> 02:52.130
-What? But I nearly got him.
-Nearly'll have to do.

03:09.105 --> 03:10.189
Hi, Mr. Olsen.

03:11.065 --> 03:13.776
Hey, Eve. Thanks for coming in.

03:13.860 --> 03:15.528
Coffee, two sugars, just how you like.

03:15.612 --> 03:17.947
You remembered.
Uh, thank you, that's very kind.

03:18.031 --> 03:20.742
-Hey, anything for my favorite ex-boss.
-Ah.

03:21.576 --> 03:22.869
Don't tell Ms. Grant I said that.

03:22.952 --> 03:24.162
I most certainly will.

03:25.455 --> 03:26.664
So, what did you want to see me about?

03:27.373 --> 03:29.375
Uh, just wanted to ask you
a few questions, if that's okay.

03:29.751 --> 03:31.794
-Sure.
- Please.

03:31.878 --> 03:32.921
Um...

03:33.004 --> 03:36.174
So, uh, a few weeks ago,
I had a report put on my desk...

03:36.257 --> 03:37.300
Um...

03:38.843 --> 03:43.806
That detailed a black budget at L-Corp.

03:45.141 --> 03:47.060
Normally, I would be
digging into this myself,

03:47.143 --> 03:49.312
but I figured with the nature
of your relationship there--

03:49.395 --> 03:51.481
You figured you'd ask me first?

03:51.940 --> 03:52.815
It's probably easier.

03:54.317 --> 03:55.401
Um...

03:57.779 --> 03:59.072
Obviously, this is something

03:59.155 --> 04:01.824
I'm going to have to talk about
with Ms. Luthor,

04:03.201 --> 04:04.619
but there's nothing to worry about.

04:05.161 --> 04:06.746
The black budget is a tool we use

04:06.829 --> 04:08.873
to shield proprietary science
from our competitors.

04:10.583 --> 04:11.709
So nothing's off?

04:12.919 --> 04:14.087
Mr. Olsen,

04:14.170 --> 04:18.424
you and Ms. Luthor are in a rough patch.

04:20.051 --> 04:21.094
Look at it out there.

04:22.136 --> 04:25.098
Lena is trying to help make
that reality better.

04:26.474 --> 04:27.892
Still, with her approval,

04:27.976 --> 04:29.852
I will email you the budget
so you can see for yourself.

04:30.979 --> 04:33.690
But I promise,
we're one of the good guys.

04:35.483 --> 04:37.068
-Thank you, Eve.
-Of course.

04:47.954 --> 04:49.330
Ms. Luthor,

04:49.414 --> 04:52.250
I was just informed that you're refusing
to test my volunteers.

04:52.792 --> 04:54.836
-Is this true?
-Yes.

04:54.919 --> 04:57.255
The serum's purification level
is still below 90 percent.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.133
At this point, human trials
are too great a risk.

05:00.216 --> 05:02.302
-I disagree.
-Well, that's not your decision.

05:02.927 --> 05:04.554
Tensions in this nation are high.

05:05.388 --> 05:06.764
To keep the peace,

05:06.848 --> 05:09.642
I need my soldiers to be
as strong and as fast as they can be.

05:09.726 --> 05:11.144
I need them super.

05:11.227 --> 05:13.980
And I understand that,
but rushing science is not the answer.

05:14.063 --> 05:15.606
Time is a luxury we do not have.

05:15.690 --> 05:17.817
Don't you think I know that?

05:17.900 --> 05:19.402
I want this serum as quickly as you do,

05:19.485 --> 05:21.529
but I refuse to rush anything
that may kill your agents.

05:21.612 --> 05:23.448
Soldiers take risks every day.

05:23.531 --> 05:25.325
I just need more time.

05:25.408 --> 05:26.659
Fine.

05:27.952 --> 05:30.204
But remember, you were hired to do a job.

05:30.621 --> 05:31.581
Do it.

05:37.503 --> 05:39.047
-Ms. Luthor, I need to tell you something.
-Eve,

05:39.797 --> 05:41.049
can we discuss this later?

05:41.966 --> 05:44.594
Today, this is the only thing
that matters.

05:49.348 --> 05:52.101
Okay. I circled the Earth twice,
east to west.

05:52.185 --> 05:53.895
North to south for me, and--

05:53.978 --> 05:55.730
No sign of the Elite anywhere.

05:56.814 --> 05:58.441
I should've dealt with
this Manchester business

05:58.524 --> 05:59.484
when I had the chance.

05:59.567 --> 06:01.152
You brought him to the police.
What more could you do?

06:01.235 --> 06:03.654
Now the Elite is as bad as Lockwood
and his Liberty fanatics.

06:03.738 --> 06:07.241
Look, all that matters now
is that we find them, and we end this.

06:07.742 --> 06:09.619
A classic superhero speech.

06:11.871 --> 06:15.249
Just... First, we should really do
something about Menagerie.

06:16.375 --> 06:18.878
There's only so much footwear advice
I can take.

06:18.961 --> 06:21.005
Gucci all day and Prada all night.

06:27.053 --> 06:28.471
You can't do this.

06:35.269 --> 06:36.979
Supergirl left us a present.

06:37.939 --> 06:38.981
And a note.

06:42.693 --> 06:43.903
It says, "You're welcome."

06:45.446 --> 06:47.115
Well, she did manage to take down
one of the Elite

06:47.198 --> 06:50.118
and stop Lockwood's assassination
in a day.

06:50.201 --> 06:52.495
Then it sounds like
you've got some breathing room,

06:52.578 --> 06:53.996
which is a good thing.

06:54.413 --> 06:56.874
The president asked me to re-assign you
to a security detail.

06:56.958 --> 06:59.502
-Security? Whose?
- Mine.

07:01.796 --> 07:05.091
But please don't worry, Director Danvers.

07:05.174 --> 07:08.344
I, uh, I come in peace.

07:14.434 --> 07:15.977
Guard Ben Lockwood?

07:16.060 --> 07:17.687
You can't be serious.

07:17.770 --> 07:21.274
-President doesn't joke.
-Lockwood is a murderer.

07:21.983 --> 07:24.402
The only ones that should be
watching over him are prison guards.

07:24.485 --> 07:27.530
Director, you swore
to keep this country safe.

07:27.613 --> 07:29.824
Protecting Ben Lockwood does just that.

07:30.533 --> 07:31.993
Extremists are out to kill him,

07:32.076 --> 07:34.454
and if they succeed,
we will have a revolution on our hands.

07:34.537 --> 07:35.913
There are other qualified agents.

07:35.997 --> 07:36.914
No one has more experience

07:36.998 --> 07:39.250
dealing with hostile extraterrestrials
than you.

07:40.168 --> 07:41.252
And the president knows it.

07:42.420 --> 07:45.506
If you've got an issue doing your job,
you need to take it up with him.

07:51.012 --> 07:53.473
Well, looks like you're stuck with me.

07:56.684 --> 07:58.478
Press conference in ten. Shall we?

08:04.233 --> 08:06.652
-Does it usually take this long?
-What, the dreaming?

08:08.613 --> 08:10.698
Her handling of the dreamscape
is getting faster,

08:10.781 --> 08:12.325
but the Elite could be anywhere.

08:13.409 --> 08:15.828
Have you told her she doesn't have to
wear the suit in private?

08:15.912 --> 08:17.497
It's just a phase.

08:17.580 --> 08:19.499
I did the same thing
when I became Supergirl,

08:19.582 --> 08:21.000
I practically slept in my suit.

08:21.083 --> 08:22.877
-And, I mean, let's face it,

08:23.544 --> 08:25.087
the suits are pretty cool.

08:26.172 --> 08:27.173
Yeah.

08:29.425 --> 08:32.970
J'onn, the... The Elite really seem
to be getting to you.

08:33.054 --> 08:34.180
What's wrong?

08:35.348 --> 08:38.684
This Manchester brings out feelings in me
that I haven't felt in a very long time.

08:39.435 --> 08:41.604
I don't like feeling like this.

08:41.687 --> 08:44.565
Like I could... lose control.

08:46.317 --> 08:48.444
And I just don't know
where it's coming from.

08:48.528 --> 08:49.904
We all have people
who push our buttons, J'onn,

08:49.987 --> 08:51.447
-it's natural.
-Yeah.

08:52.990 --> 08:54.825
Manchester gets under my skin.

08:56.452 --> 08:58.204
Well, good thing Martians have thick skin.

09:01.082 --> 09:04.126
So we have teams set up
at your DC and Collinwood residences.

09:04.210 --> 09:06.045
And I should be getting
an update every hour.

09:06.128 --> 09:07.380
I have to say, it is so great

09:07.463 --> 09:10.216
to finally have a human
in charge of the DEO.

09:10.299 --> 09:12.093
I mean, the idea that an alien

09:12.176 --> 09:15.638
would be running the very department
in charge of policing aliens--

09:15.721 --> 09:18.224
Did you hear that from the DEO agent
that you turned into a terrorist?

09:18.307 --> 09:19.934
Uh, no, from the president.

09:22.895 --> 09:25.898
Okay. I know that you think that
I'm a monster,

09:25.982 --> 09:29.151
but half of England said the same thing
about Winston Churchill,

09:29.235 --> 09:31.070
before World War II, so...

09:31.779 --> 09:34.323
I guess we'll just wait and see.

09:35.449 --> 09:36.826
History will prove me right.

09:39.996 --> 09:40.955
Director Lockwood,

09:41.038 --> 09:42.915
how are you going to stop
domestic terrorism?

09:43.416 --> 09:44.959
Well, I'm great, thank you for asking.

09:45.960 --> 09:49.338
Listen, I, uh, don't really
want to talk about the Elite

09:49.422 --> 09:52.049
or their assassination attempt
on me last night.

09:52.133 --> 09:53.342
Instead,

09:53.426 --> 09:57.555
I would like to discuss with you
what I was prevented from announcing.

09:58.723 --> 10:02.768
My drive to repeal the Alien Amnesty Act.

10:03.269 --> 10:05.062
<i>Because for too long,</i>

10:05.146 --> 10:08.274
<i>alien criminals have come down</i>
<i>to this planet,</i>

10:08.357 --> 10:11.569
<i>and they have been given amnesty,</i>
<i>they've been given protection...</i>

10:12.486 --> 10:14.614
<i>when we are the ones</i>
<i>that need protecting.</i>

10:14.697 --> 10:16.449
<i>We are the ones</i>

10:16.532 --> 10:18.576
<i>who have been suffering. Not them.</i>

10:19.285 --> 10:21.412
With the repeal of the Alien Amnesty Act,

10:21.495 --> 10:24.373
I propose that we send these invaders

10:24.457 --> 10:26.334
back to the planets that they came from,

10:26.417 --> 10:30.630
allowing us to finally live in peace.

10:32.214 --> 10:34.800
I would like to invite you
to a rally tomorrow

10:34.884 --> 10:36.719
in the main concourse
of this very building,

10:36.802 --> 10:38.846
<i> where I will share with you</i>
<i>what I intend to share with Congress...</i>

10:38.929 --> 10:40.014
He can't do that.

10:41.015 --> 10:44.435
Tell me Ben Lockwood
cannot repeal a congressional act--

10:44.518 --> 10:46.437
No, but he can try and sway
the will of the people.

10:46.520 --> 10:49.065
He's just begging the Elite
to take another whack at him.

10:49.482 --> 10:51.734
Which is why
we have to find them before his rally.

10:51.817 --> 10:54.236
-If only we knew where to look.
-The balcony!

10:56.030 --> 10:57.907
Across from the Alien Affairs Building.

10:58.366 --> 11:01.118
-The same place as last night?
-I saw it in my dream.

11:01.869 --> 11:04.789
And returning to the scene of the crime
is a classic bad guy move.

11:06.916 --> 11:08.417
Agent Dox.
Yes, ma'am?

11:09.043 --> 11:11.295
Since Director Lockwood's
little announcement,

11:11.379 --> 11:14.298
a pro-alien march has been organized
to counter his rally.

11:16.675 --> 11:19.970
Someone going by AmericanAlien
is at the center of this one.

11:20.596 --> 11:22.181
I need you to hack into the message board

11:22.264 --> 11:25.184
and see if any extremists
will be showing up to stir the pot.

11:26.268 --> 11:28.187
-You want to stop the march?
-No.

11:28.771 --> 11:31.816
But with Lockwood amping up his base,
and the Elite amping up theirs,

11:31.899 --> 11:33.818
this whole event
could turn into a powder keg.

11:34.568 --> 11:37.947
Well, whoever this AmericanAlien is,
their website is superbly protected.
He or she must be
a highly intelligent cryptophile.

11:43.536 --> 11:45.955
-This may take some time--
-Just do it, Dox.

11:55.589 --> 11:57.550
-Damn it!
-Dreamer said they'd be here.

11:58.843 --> 12:02.596
Dreams are interpretive.
Maybe something about them is here.

12:05.683 --> 12:06.892
Part of them is.

12:12.189 --> 12:13.232
Ugh.

12:14.024 --> 12:15.359
Morae's claw.

12:16.193 --> 12:18.237
You can use that
to track the Morae psychically, right?

12:19.196 --> 12:20.197
Yeah.

12:27.997 --> 12:29.748
Bloomin' heck, man.
Oh, bloody hell.

12:29.874 --> 12:31.542
Well, isn't this a sight.

12:31.625 --> 12:33.752
Yeah. A giant wall of ice.

12:33.836 --> 12:36.380
Now where did your pal Mxy
say the key was?

12:36.464 --> 12:38.382
-He didn't.
-What?

12:40.676 --> 12:41.886
"Under the doormat"?

12:44.054 --> 12:44.889
Right.

12:48.559 --> 12:50.686
No, not gold. It's dwarf star.

12:50.769 --> 12:53.439
Weighs around 500,000 kilos.

12:55.691 --> 12:57.318
These little bad boys will do the trick.

13:25.095 --> 13:26.388
You're very welcome.

13:27.056 --> 13:29.225
Now, can we please get something
for Mo's mitt?

13:32.436 --> 13:33.479
Of course we can.

13:35.940 --> 13:38.526
Oh, I wager we can find

13:38.609 --> 13:40.069
whatever we want in here.

13:56.210 --> 13:57.628
You texted me.
What was so important?

13:57.711 --> 14:00.047
I am going to kill Ben Lockwood.

14:00.339 --> 14:02.341
That? That was the emergency?

14:02.424 --> 14:04.885
Emotional emergency. Yeah. I hate him.

14:04.969 --> 14:06.136
Well, you and a lot of people.

14:06.220 --> 14:09.014
Not a lot of people have just
been put in charge of his security.

14:09.640 --> 14:11.308
-I was.
-What?

14:11.392 --> 14:13.018
Yup. By order of the president.

14:13.310 --> 14:15.688
- Oh.
-I don't know what I should do.

14:15.771 --> 14:19.024
Especially when I should be out there
tracking down Manchester and the Elite,

14:19.108 --> 14:20.901
who I'm pretty sure
are still targeting him.

14:20.985 --> 14:24.280
Well, I'm sure Supergirl will find 'em,
and before that rally,

14:24.363 --> 14:26.365
so you don't have to worry about Lockwood.

14:26.907 --> 14:27.908
Yeah.

14:27.992 --> 14:31.161
But how can I with a clear conscience

14:31.245 --> 14:33.831
protect a man who is causing
so much pain in the world?

14:36.166 --> 14:38.043
You're a hero, Alex.
Heroes make tough decisions.

14:41.338 --> 14:42.715
Well, that's not very helpful.

14:44.508 --> 14:45.968
I mean, it's your job, right?

14:46.051 --> 14:48.345
-Right.
-You keep people safe.

14:49.513 --> 14:51.140
And like it or not,

14:51.223 --> 14:54.727
protecting Lockwood at that rally
will keep all of those people safe.

14:55.978 --> 14:57.396
Human and aliens.

14:58.898 --> 15:00.900
I thought that was good advice.
I don't know--

15:00.983 --> 15:03.027
Well, it is. It is.

15:03.110 --> 15:05.321
It's just exactly what Haley said.

15:05.404 --> 15:06.989
-Ugh.

15:07.239 --> 15:09.617
-Join me.
-I can't. I have a deadline.

15:12.661 --> 15:14.914
Okay, fine, but I call the potstickers.

15:14.997 --> 15:16.665
-What? No.
-All of them. Mmm-hmm.

15:16.749 --> 15:18.375
-That's ridiculous.
-Mmm.

15:19.752 --> 15:22.171
All we're saying is,
if one of us is rottin' in a cell,

15:22.296 --> 15:25.049
it ought to be a priority to get her back.

15:25.174 --> 15:27.384
And all I'm saying is,
we'll fetch Menagerie

15:27.468 --> 15:30.554
as soon as we find what
lets us get around Supergirl.

15:30.638 --> 15:32.598
So we can snuff Benny Boy.

15:33.974 --> 15:36.435
This is the belly of the beast.

15:36.518 --> 15:39.021
Bound to be the seeds
of her destruction somewhere.

15:39.104 --> 15:42.608
Or we just use this.

15:43.233 --> 15:46.612
Taking down Supergirl and killing Lockwood
don't win hearts and minds.

15:46.695 --> 15:47.738
But this?

15:48.906 --> 15:52.076
This will let us activate
all our alien brothers and sisters.

15:52.159 --> 15:53.827
Ooh.

15:56.121 --> 15:58.415
Or we can do even more
with its little brother.

15:58.499 --> 16:00.292
Meh.

16:01.418 --> 16:02.503
"Meh"?

16:07.049 --> 16:10.177
-What about the revolution?
-Killing Lockwood is the revolution.

16:10.260 --> 16:12.221
They take one of ours,
we take one of theirs!

16:14.098 --> 16:15.975
Hey.

16:16.058 --> 16:17.643
You loved Fi like blood, right?

16:18.686 --> 16:20.145
Don't you want to see
her murderer go down?

16:20.229 --> 16:22.147
Yeah, but that isn't
what we set out to do.

16:22.231 --> 16:23.941
We're supposed to be changing the world.

16:24.024 --> 16:26.860
Not acting suicidal to settle old scores.

16:26.944 --> 16:29.405
Back home when the gang found out
you and Fi were otherworldly,

16:29.488 --> 16:31.615
I stuck up for you at great peril.

16:31.699 --> 16:33.158
And you can't do the same for me?

16:33.242 --> 16:34.743
That's different and you know it.

16:35.828 --> 16:36.996
Nah, mate.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.540
The only one that's different now is you.

16:42.001 --> 16:44.378
Come on, Mo. We've lost this one.

16:46.463 --> 16:48.257
I hope you find what you're looking for.

16:49.216 --> 16:50.426
And choke on it.

17:02.938 --> 17:05.899
I can feel the Morae, but I can't see her.

17:05.983 --> 17:07.443
Something's blocking me.

17:09.486 --> 17:10.779
I have an idea.

17:17.995 --> 17:20.789
I don't quite get what you're saying,
but I hear you about Hat.

17:20.873 --> 17:22.791
Too many cooks spoil the broth.

17:24.376 --> 17:25.335
Hmm.

17:33.719 --> 17:36.180
That's keen.

17:40.976 --> 17:42.728
We need to get Supergirl now.

17:45.022 --> 17:47.066
Something tells me
the thing we're looking for

17:47.149 --> 17:49.109
is right around this corner.

17:50.694 --> 17:52.529
Manchester! It's over!

18:02.206 --> 18:03.624
Yield or die.

18:03.707 --> 18:05.542
Just take it down to like a seven.

18:05.626 --> 18:07.252
Yield, or else.

18:22.184 --> 18:23.268
That's new.

18:28.065 --> 18:29.650
Fun toys she's got here.

18:29.733 --> 18:31.568
This ends right now.

18:32.402 --> 18:33.779
You got that right.

18:34.363 --> 18:35.447
Manchester, no!

18:57.803 --> 18:59.721
The mouth on that one. Honestly.

19:01.390 --> 19:04.393
Any movement on our AmericanAlien
or their website?

19:04.476 --> 19:07.646
None. Their online fingerprint
is generic, at best.

19:07.729 --> 19:09.690
Unidentifiable, at worst.

19:09.773 --> 19:12.693
Without knowing their key, accessing
the message board is next to impossible.

19:13.318 --> 19:14.736
And the march's headcount?

19:14.820 --> 19:16.446
Hovering just over a thousand.

19:16.530 --> 19:18.240
We need to get agents
on the ground for it.

19:18.323 --> 19:19.700
Do we?

19:21.618 --> 19:23.412
In thinking of peaceful protests,

19:23.495 --> 19:25.998
might we consider the success
of the Women's March,

19:26.081 --> 19:27.958
the Million Man March, the Freedom March--

19:28.083 --> 19:29.293
Tiananmen Square.

19:29.918 --> 19:32.421
The Bonus March of 1932.

19:32.504 --> 19:35.591
For every success story,
there is one of lives lost.

19:36.258 --> 19:38.927
This march is filled
with nearly 1,000 aliens,

19:39.011 --> 19:41.889
or alien allies,
which fall under our protection.

19:41.972 --> 19:43.640
And if anything goes wrong, it's on us.

19:44.766 --> 19:46.018
Organize a team.

19:47.227 --> 19:48.478
Very well.

19:48.562 --> 19:51.023
I shall update Agent Reiff
on AmericanAlien's profile.

19:51.106 --> 19:53.984
There's no time for that.
I want you to lead it.

19:54.067 --> 19:55.319
-Me?
-Yes.

19:55.402 --> 19:57.946
Danvers has a team in Lockwood's rally.

19:58.030 --> 19:59.448
You two should coordinate.
I still can't believe it.

20:07.331 --> 20:08.457
Thank you.

20:09.416 --> 20:11.168
He just ran straight into the room.

20:12.711 --> 20:14.546
-He wouldn't stop.
-What was in there?
A baby Sun-Eater.

20:17.174 --> 20:18.383
Kal's.

20:19.551 --> 20:21.929
It feeds on the chemical mass
of small stars.

20:22.012 --> 20:24.598
So, it's basically a living bomb.

20:25.182 --> 20:27.059
Oh... J'onn.

20:28.310 --> 20:31.230
It's strange. I've always
been able to sense Manchester,

20:32.522 --> 20:34.858
feel his rage, his anger, but...

20:36.360 --> 20:37.694
I can't anymore.

20:40.322 --> 20:42.199
It's almost like a weight has been lifted.

20:44.534 --> 20:46.036
-I almost feel--
- Relieved.

20:48.538 --> 20:50.582
Sometimes we don't realize the impact

20:50.666 --> 20:52.459
people have had on us until they're gone.

20:53.835 --> 20:55.420
For good or bad.

20:56.546 --> 20:58.173
Hmm. Thank you.

20:59.174 --> 21:00.467
Both of you.

21:01.426 --> 21:03.637
Maybe now he can find some peace.

21:05.097 --> 21:08.225
Still, Hat's out there,
and we have a job to do.

21:08.308 --> 21:11.812
I may not have a totem, but I can
still try searching for him psychically.

21:13.689 --> 21:15.107
What about us?

21:15.190 --> 21:18.151
We monitor the news
and see if anything pops up.

21:20.904 --> 21:22.447
I was hoping
to speak to Trent Miller.

21:22.531 --> 21:25.492
He's a forensic accountant.
He's looking into a budget for me.

21:26.618 --> 21:28.287
Oh, is that right? Uh, well...

21:29.955 --> 21:32.124
When he gets back in, just have him
give me a call on this line.

21:32.207 --> 21:34.126
Uh, it's James Olsen. Thank you.

21:34.209 --> 21:35.961
Mum, the march will be safe.

21:36.044 --> 21:37.087
I love you, too.

21:38.046 --> 21:39.214
Bye.

21:41.466 --> 21:42.801
Nervous about covering the march?

21:42.884 --> 21:44.469
I'm fine.

21:44.553 --> 21:46.096
No, it's okay if you are, Franklin.

21:48.181 --> 21:50.559
I mean, we are living
in crazy times, right?

21:52.144 --> 21:54.271
It's just important to remember
what we do here every day.

21:55.147 --> 21:56.815
Reporting on events like this,

21:56.898 --> 21:58.650
taking the risk to show all sides,

21:58.734 --> 22:00.652
showing the humanity there.

22:00.736 --> 22:02.237
It's nothing less than heroic.

22:03.405 --> 22:04.781
I mean, think about it.

22:04.906 --> 22:06.283
If you're fighting justice
with your fists,

22:06.366 --> 22:09.161
you can help one, maybe a dozen people.

22:10.704 --> 22:11.955
But good journalism...

22:13.332 --> 22:15.042
That can impact millions.

22:16.710 --> 22:18.962
It's why we became journalists
in the first place, right?

22:20.797 --> 22:22.007
Yeah.

22:23.133 --> 22:25.802
-Thanks, Mr. Olsen.
-No problem.

22:29.181 --> 22:30.932
-Franklin?
-Yeah.

22:31.016 --> 22:32.893
You need a photographer?

22:33.143 --> 22:36.396
<i>Thousands of aliens</i>
<i>and their supporters have turned out...</i>

22:36.480 --> 22:38.106
-Brainy.
-Greetings.

22:38.190 --> 22:39.483
Why are you in your suit?

22:40.776 --> 22:41.818
Breaking it in.

22:43.320 --> 22:44.321
I have nothing.

22:45.072 --> 22:47.074
Hat must be hiding in the Fifth Dimension.

22:47.157 --> 22:48.867
The energy there makes him untraceable.

22:48.950 --> 22:51.328
Uh, yes, I heard about
Manchester's passing.

22:51.411 --> 22:53.246
Um, the Legion ring.

22:53.330 --> 22:55.665
He... He took my ring.

22:56.416 --> 22:57.417
Was it...

23:03.090 --> 23:04.007
Oh.

23:04.758 --> 23:05.884
Well...

23:08.470 --> 23:10.347
That's put to bed now.

23:10.430 --> 23:13.600
Ah, yes. It's the march today, isn't it?

23:14.267 --> 23:15.602
Will you all be joining?

23:16.603 --> 23:19.773
You know, I think we could all
use some peaceful protest today.

23:19.856 --> 23:21.691
-Yeah, I'll be there.
-Wonderful.

23:22.192 --> 23:24.528
Kara, Nia... Uh, Dreamer.

23:24.611 --> 23:26.863
Yes. I definitely think
we should be there.

23:26.947 --> 23:28.865
-Huzzah!
-To patrol.

23:29.116 --> 23:30.784
-What?
-Dreamer stands with Supergirl.

23:31.493 --> 23:32.577
Just gotta stretch first.

23:33.120 --> 23:34.996
Right. Um...

23:35.080 --> 23:36.790
Kara, a word?

23:40.043 --> 23:42.546
I think it would mean a lot
to have Supergirl march today.

23:42.629 --> 23:44.339
I wish I could, Brainy,

23:44.422 --> 23:46.133
but I think it's more important
for me to patrol,

23:46.216 --> 23:47.843
in case things got out of hand.

23:48.510 --> 23:49.678
They won't.

23:50.470 --> 23:52.013
I am AmericanAlien.

23:52.931 --> 23:55.559
Hashtag AmericanAlien.

23:55.642 --> 23:57.310
You organized it?

23:57.394 --> 23:59.646
When I lost my Legion ring,

23:59.729 --> 24:01.523
I realized how much I depended on it.

24:01.606 --> 24:03.441
For strength and confidence.

24:04.818 --> 24:06.403
I thought it's what made me a hero.

24:07.904 --> 24:09.447
But not having it these past few days

24:09.531 --> 24:12.409
has made me see it wasn't
my ring that gave me strength.

24:13.535 --> 24:15.495
It was fighting alongside all of you,

24:15.579 --> 24:18.331
helping to make the Earth a better place.

24:20.208 --> 24:23.795
In times like this, change won't come
from someone with a ring or a cape.

24:24.588 --> 24:26.548
It will only come when each one of us

24:26.631 --> 24:29.050
answers the call to stand up and be heard.

24:29.134 --> 24:30.468
El-may-arah.
Stronger together.

24:38.435 --> 24:40.312
Just because we're superheroes,

24:40.395 --> 24:42.230
it doesn't mean we forget who we are.

24:44.357 --> 24:47.360
I'm sorry, Brainy. The risk is too great.

24:47.444 --> 24:48.445
Ready.

24:52.407 --> 24:53.909
Supergirl may be a symbol,

24:55.285 --> 24:57.370
but more importantly,
she's a citizen of Earth.

24:58.413 --> 24:59.831
Like the rest of us.

25:02.375 --> 25:03.627
Remember that.

25:12.594 --> 25:13.720
Whoo!

25:26.858 --> 25:29.527
We are gathered here today

25:30.320 --> 25:31.613
to unite.

25:31.696 --> 25:34.824
To unite as human Americans

25:34.908 --> 25:39.537
to take back our great land,
and that all starts

25:39.621 --> 25:41.998
with the repeal
of the Alien Amnesty Act.

25:53.093 --> 25:54.886
<i>Agent Dox. Sitrep.</i>

25:54.970 --> 25:57.264
I have the team running perimeter checks.

25:57.347 --> 26:00.016
And I am in a prime location
to run interference.

26:00.100 --> 26:01.434
Roaches get crushed!

26:03.687 --> 26:05.647
Roaches get squashed!

26:07.399 --> 26:10.443
We've got some hecklers
on the south end alongside the march.

26:10.527 --> 26:11.987
En route.

26:12.946 --> 26:14.155
Go home, aliens!

26:14.823 --> 26:16.616
Your planet called!

26:18.201 --> 26:19.327
Go home!

26:19.411 --> 26:21.121
We don't want you!

26:23.081 --> 26:24.207
Supergirl.

26:24.291 --> 26:25.500
What are you doing here?

26:25.583 --> 26:28.378
We are here to show our support
for the repeal of Alien Amnesty.

26:28.461 --> 26:31.715
But that Amnesty is what
gives these aliens their rights.

26:31.798 --> 26:33.216
Why should they get any rights?

26:33.300 --> 26:35.343
-They're just here to hurt us.
-They're not...

26:36.678 --> 26:37.971
Look at them.

26:38.054 --> 26:39.723
They're not here to hurt anyone.

26:39.806 --> 26:42.684
Most of them are fleeing war and violence,

26:42.767 --> 26:44.394
just like I did
when I first came to Earth.

26:44.519 --> 26:46.396
They're not like you.

26:47.355 --> 26:48.565
You're a superhero.

26:51.276 --> 26:52.527
No, you're wrong.

26:53.987 --> 26:55.363
I am just like them.

26:57.741 --> 27:00.035
Were you aware that these aliens

27:00.118 --> 27:02.245
intend to march on this rally today

27:02.329 --> 27:04.873
to quiet us, to silence you?

27:04.956 --> 27:06.750
-Do they have a right to do that?
- No!

27:06.833 --> 27:10.211
Okay. I didn't think
they had a right to do that.

27:10.295 --> 27:12.005
But, hey, we're all learning.

27:12.088 --> 27:13.715
We're slow, but we're learning.

27:13.798 --> 27:15.258
We're learning from them.
We're learning...

27:16.176 --> 27:18.720
that it is us or them.

27:19.512 --> 27:21.514
Us or them.

27:21.598 --> 27:23.558
Us or them!

27:23.641 --> 27:25.185
Us or them!

27:25.268 --> 27:27.020
Us or them!

27:36.112 --> 27:38.031
-Supergirl.
-It's Kara Zor-El.

27:38.656 --> 27:39.574
Citizen of Earth.

27:40.075 --> 27:41.743
It's nice to have you with us.

27:43.411 --> 27:44.662
Me, too.

27:45.705 --> 27:47.248
Thank you.

27:47.332 --> 27:48.416
Both.

27:50.043 --> 27:52.170
Us or them.
Us or them.

27:52.253 --> 27:53.797
-Us or them.
-Us or them.

27:53.880 --> 27:56.758
Us or them!
Us or them! Us or them!
Amnesty is not the same thing as empathy.

28:01.596 --> 28:05.850
Allowing these aliens to come
to our world is not an act of kindness.

28:06.601 --> 28:10.563
It is an act of
species-wide self-sabotage.

28:10.647 --> 28:15.151
If we do not repeal the Alien Amnesty Act,

28:15.902 --> 28:17.362
they will not be our undoing,

28:17.445 --> 28:20.532
we will have done that to ourselves!

28:20.615 --> 28:23.326
You see? Right there. Us or them!

28:23.451 --> 28:25.120
Us or them!

28:25.203 --> 28:27.997
Us or them! Us or them!
-Us or them!
- What are they doing?

28:30.959 --> 28:33.086
They've come to take your planet from you!
Well, today, today, we say, no!

28:35.380 --> 28:39.426
Today, we take our planet back from them!

28:39.509 --> 28:40.719
Us or them!

28:40.802 --> 28:42.804
-Stay peaceful.

28:44.139 --> 28:46.391
-Don't stoop to his level.
-Us or them!

28:46.474 --> 28:48.017
I need to get you
off the stage now, Director.

28:48.101 --> 28:50.103
-Where's the threat?
-You're the threat.

28:50.186 --> 28:52.021
Us or them! Us or them!

28:52.105 --> 28:55.316
Hurry. Get him out of here.
Take him someplace safe, away from here.

28:55.608 --> 28:59.320
Mmm. I love the smell of revolution
in the late morning.

29:00.113 --> 29:02.073
Makes me glad to be alive.

29:03.074 --> 29:04.492
Hey...

29:08.913 --> 29:10.457
-Thanks for coming back for me.
-Of course.

29:10.540 --> 29:13.543
We really tricked them into thinking
you walked into that Sun-Eater room.

29:13.626 --> 29:16.045
Plus, you were there for me
in my time of need back home,

29:16.129 --> 29:18.423
least I could do is return the favor.

29:19.048 --> 29:21.259
Just glad you've come around
to my way of thinking.

29:24.721 --> 29:25.764
Shall we?

29:28.683 --> 29:30.101
Us or them!

29:30.226 --> 29:32.020
Us or them!

29:32.103 --> 29:35.440
Us or them! Us or them!

29:35.523 --> 29:37.692
Us or them! Us or them!

29:37.776 --> 29:39.444
Aliens of this world!

29:39.527 --> 29:41.070
These pigs wanna kill you.

29:41.821 --> 29:44.157
And what, you're gonna take it lying down?

29:44.240 --> 29:47.202
-Oh, no.
-I say, it's time we rise up,

29:47.285 --> 29:48.620
and take them to the slaughter.

29:49.954 --> 29:52.081
So find the nearest alien-hater

29:52.665 --> 29:54.000
and kill them!

30:09.641 --> 30:11.309
The revolution is now!

30:11.392 --> 30:12.685
Take your power back!
Come on!

30:15.480 --> 30:17.524
Hat must have saved Manchester
in the Fortress,

30:17.607 --> 30:18.983
then hidden in the Fifth Dimension--

30:19.067 --> 30:20.610
That's why I couldn't sense him.

30:23.988 --> 30:25.782
-Hologram.
-Then where's the real Manchester?

30:25.865 --> 30:27.575
Close. Given the strength of the signal,

30:27.659 --> 30:29.452
the broadcasting radius
must be less than a city block.

30:29.536 --> 30:31.871
Okay, Brainy, Nia, you clear the area,

30:31.955 --> 30:33.915
-I'll handle--
-Leave Manchester to me!

30:35.375 --> 30:36.835
Right, like I said...

30:37.460 --> 30:40.004
J'onn's got Manchester, I'll find Hat.

30:42.215 --> 30:43.758
Time for a costume change.

30:47.136 --> 30:49.639
Brilliant. Bloody brilliant.

30:55.019 --> 30:56.938
Always one step behind, J'onn.

30:59.858 --> 31:01.234
You can see me.

31:03.945 --> 31:05.238
Manchester!

31:09.158 --> 31:10.368
One for you...

31:12.245 --> 31:13.705
And one for you.

31:14.706 --> 31:15.874
And one for you.

31:15.957 --> 31:18.042
Hello, Hat. We meet again.

31:18.126 --> 31:20.086
Well, if it isn't the Ringless Wonder.

31:37.020 --> 31:39.564
You don't need a ring
when you have friends.

31:39.647 --> 31:40.899
So where are your friends now?

31:46.613 --> 31:47.655
Nice work, Brainy.

31:48.573 --> 31:49.824
Now, get him to the DEO,

31:49.908 --> 31:52.785
and then help me get as many
of these people to safety as you can.

32:17.810 --> 32:19.312
Go back to your planet, roach!

32:19.395 --> 32:20.605
No, please!

32:23.983 --> 32:25.026
Get out of here!

32:27.153 --> 32:28.863
-Thanks, uh...
-Dreamer.

32:28.947 --> 32:30.615
Nice to have another superhero in town.

32:42.794 --> 32:45.380
Is this where you tell me
Fiona wouldn't wanna see me this way?

32:45.922 --> 32:47.757
And that my soul's still worth saving?

32:49.384 --> 32:50.426
No.

32:51.302 --> 32:53.429
I think you're glad Fiona's gone.

32:54.263 --> 32:55.556
-What?
-With her out of the way,

32:55.640 --> 32:57.141
it gives you an excuse to do all this!

32:57.225 --> 32:58.643
This is for justice!

32:59.143 --> 33:00.812
You have the same excuse, too!

33:00.895 --> 33:02.605
Your wife! Your daughters!

33:07.986 --> 33:09.404
Maybe you just need to lose more.

33:11.781 --> 33:12.824
More!

33:14.200 --> 33:15.201
More!
More!

33:44.313 --> 33:47.358
I think we're seeing each other
much clearer now, J'onn.

35:00.139 --> 35:01.224
Thank you, Supergirl.

35:02.308 --> 35:03.434
No, thank you.

35:51.065 --> 35:52.692
I think if it hadn't been
for Manchester,

35:52.775 --> 35:54.235
the march would have been a success.

35:54.318 --> 35:55.528
Even if it wasn't,

35:55.611 --> 35:58.739
amidst all the fighting,
I could feel people coming together.

35:58.823 --> 36:01.200
-We changed some minds.
-And some hearts, too.

36:01.284 --> 36:04.620
I mean, even in the protests in Gotham
and Metropolis, no one got hurt.

36:04.704 --> 36:06.455
People respected each other's differences.

36:06.998 --> 36:08.332
Even yesterday,

36:08.416 --> 36:10.168
I saw some real moments of humanity.

36:10.251 --> 36:11.502
Like in your photo, Mr. Olsen.

36:12.628 --> 36:16.382
It always amazes me
how one image can change the conversation.

36:16.465 --> 36:18.926
Exactly. I heard
in the elevator this morning

36:19.010 --> 36:22.013
someone say that
your photo moved them so much

36:22.096 --> 36:25.057
that they're going to volunteer
at an alien outreach center.

36:25.141 --> 36:27.059
It feels good to be part of the progress,

36:27.143 --> 36:29.562
but the real credit goes
to Supergirl and her new sidekick.

36:30.313 --> 36:32.190
I would love to get an exclusive
with them, if I could.

36:32.273 --> 36:33.482
Sidekick?

36:33.566 --> 36:34.650
I'll get right on that.

36:34.734 --> 36:36.277
-Thanks.
- Mr. Olsen?

36:36.903 --> 36:38.237
You need to see this.

36:38.321 --> 36:39.572
Sure thing.

36:40.114 --> 36:43.201
- A sidekick? That's like me?
-I don't know. I didn't tell him...

36:43.951 --> 36:46.996
<i>...and as a result</i>
<i>of yesterday's demonstration,</i>

36:47.079 --> 36:50.625
<i>the president and I, um,</i>

36:50.708 --> 36:53.836
<i>think it's best to hold</i>
<i>congressional hearings on the matter</i>

36:53.920 --> 36:56.672
<i>before we take any further steps.</i>
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

36:56.756 --> 36:57.882
We did it!

36:58.424 --> 37:00.343
We stopped the repeal.
For now, at least.

37:02.470 --> 37:04.847
The power of the press,
it's an amazing thing.

37:05.890 --> 37:07.266
So is the power of the people.

37:09.602 --> 37:11.437
<i>...demonstration, the president and I...</i>

37:11.520 --> 37:12.813
Director Danvers.

37:13.272 --> 37:15.066
It's good to see you back in the DEO.

37:15.149 --> 37:16.651
It's good to be back, Colonel.

37:17.151 --> 37:20.154
Lockwood is a bureaucrat
with power he doesn't understand.
Not only does that make things dangerous,
it makes our job difficult.

37:24.033 --> 37:24.992
Yeah.

37:25.076 --> 37:27.203
But you were a good soldier yesterday,

37:27.286 --> 37:30.331
putting your duty above your politics.

37:31.123 --> 37:32.833
Not many would have been able to do that.

37:33.626 --> 37:34.627
Thank you.

37:37.797 --> 37:39.924
From all that mess
comes something positive.

37:40.841 --> 37:44.428
Looks like AmericanAlien
was one of the good guys, after all.

37:49.433 --> 37:51.894
-She's very...
-Confounding.

37:51.978 --> 37:53.020
-Yes.
-Yes.

38:00.903 --> 38:02.989
Your ex is pretty good with a camera.

38:04.365 --> 38:05.700
I read the tabloids.

38:09.328 --> 38:11.163
There is a civil war brewing,

38:11.247 --> 38:12.707
I can smell it in the air.

38:13.833 --> 38:15.626
But there might be hope
for the country yet.

38:16.836 --> 38:20.673
Seems time is on your side for now,
so take the night off.

38:24.969 --> 38:27.138
Well, I guess tomorrow's another day.

38:29.807 --> 38:31.434
Tomorrow may be too late.

38:49.702 --> 38:51.746
Where are you, Manchester?

38:55.374 --> 38:57.793
Maybe you just need to lose more.

39:02.298 --> 39:04.800
You can't change me.

39:04.884 --> 39:08.220
Today I find you like a Manhunter.

39:17.521 --> 39:19.940
Okay, wait, wait, wait.
You have to go back to the part

39:20.024 --> 39:22.568
where you strong-armed Ben Lockwood.

39:22.651 --> 39:25.154
-Oh, my gosh, you so have a bloodlust.
-Please.

39:27.531 --> 39:29.784
I mean, I don't know,
the whole thing was crazy.

39:30.785 --> 39:33.579
You know, I've never been
through something like that before.

39:33.662 --> 39:36.290
And I know that Supergirl and I

39:36.374 --> 39:38.334
haven't really been
on the same page lately.

39:38.918 --> 39:41.045
You know, seeing her out there
in that march,

39:41.128 --> 39:43.339
hand in hand with everybody else,

39:44.298 --> 39:46.550
-I was inspired.
-Yeah.

39:46.634 --> 39:49.303
To... To rough Ben Lockwood up.

39:49.387 --> 39:51.097
No. No!

39:51.180 --> 39:52.848
No, it was... You know, I...

39:53.307 --> 39:56.268
I followed my beliefs, not the rules.

39:56.352 --> 39:58.813
And it felt really good
to take a moral stand.

39:58.896 --> 40:00.856
Yeah, I think everyone that marched
felt that way.

40:00.940 --> 40:02.108
Mmm-hmm.

40:02.566 --> 40:05.528
Seeing all those people come out
to have their convictions heard...

40:06.195 --> 40:08.280
-And... And James' photos.
-Yeah.

40:08.364 --> 40:11.409
Seeing people who had been fighting
helping each other, that was...

40:12.326 --> 40:14.328
It just goes to show,

40:14.412 --> 40:18.082
no matter who you are,
alien, human, superhero,

40:19.333 --> 40:22.461
every action counts,
and every voice matters.

40:22.545 --> 40:25.548
And who knows,
maybe the good guys will win in the end.

40:25.714 --> 40:27.591
-Exactly.
-Cheers.
