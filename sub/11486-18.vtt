<i>Some side effects include headaches,</i>
<i>blurred vision, and high blood pressure.</i>

00:05.760 --> 00:08.148
<i>Ask your doctor if it's right for you.</i>

00:08.320 --> 00:10.038
- Dad?
- Yeah?

00:10.200 --> 00:13.317
Do you suffer
from erectile dysfunction?

00:15.880 --> 00:17.711
Well, Alan? Do you?

00:19.480 --> 00:23.951
Jake, wh... What do you know
about erectile dysfunction?

00:24.160 --> 00:26.310
It's something to do
with your penis, right?

00:26.520 --> 00:28.795
- Right.
- And they say one out of three guys...

00:28.960 --> 00:32.396
...gets it, and mine's fine,
so it's gotta be one of you.

00:34.840 --> 00:37.035
- I'm fine.
- Not me, l...

00:37.480 --> 00:39.471
So, what are the pills for?

00:39.640 --> 00:43.315
Well, what they do, Jake, is that
they... They dilate the blood vessels...

00:43.480 --> 00:47.155
...which allows more blood
to easily flow to certain...

00:47.360 --> 00:49.032
They're boner pills, Jake.

00:51.520 --> 00:53.670
To get them,
or to make them go away?

00:53.840 --> 00:55.478
To get them. Go get ready for bed.

00:55.680 --> 00:58.353
What's the point?
They're not good for anything.

01:01.440 --> 01:02.998
You ever try any of those drugs?

01:03.200 --> 01:06.112
Once or twice.
Out of curiosity, not necessity.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.956
- What did you think?
- Not my thing.

01:09.120 --> 01:13.193
It's like corking the bat.
You?

01:13.360 --> 01:17.956
Yeah, that's what my ex-wife wanted.
More sex with me that lasted longer.

01:21.480 --> 01:26.190
Hello. Oh, hey, Eric. Hiya.
What's happening, boyfriend?

01:26.400 --> 01:29.790
Oh, you're terrible. Do you kiss
your mother with that mouth?

01:29.960 --> 01:33.839
So, what's up? Saturday?
Let me check my book.

01:36.200 --> 01:39.078
Saturday is marvelous.

01:39.400 --> 01:44.076
How dressy? Eveningwear,
or California casual?

01:44.360 --> 01:47.750
Oh, goody. An excuse to shop.
Like I need one.

01:47.920 --> 01:50.992
Okey-dokey, artichokey. Ciao for now.

01:55.800 --> 01:57.791
- What?
- Something you wanna tell me?

01:58.160 --> 02:01.311
That? Oh, that's Eric.
He's the head of a big ad agency.

02:01.480 --> 02:04.597
- Throws a lot of jingle work my way.
- He wouldn't be gay, would he?

02:04.800 --> 02:07.360
What difference does it make?
A person's sexuality...

02:07.520 --> 02:10.717
...is a personal thing. It has no
relevance in the business world.

02:10.880 --> 02:13.758
- But he is gay.
- Oh, yeah.

02:14.200 --> 02:17.158
You know, it's okay
to call them queer again.

02:17.800 --> 02:19.791
Good to know. Good to know.

02:19.960 --> 02:23.919
Would it fair to assume that
you've led him to believe that...

02:24.080 --> 02:26.036
...you are of a similar persuasion?

02:26.240 --> 02:30.518
Not deliberately.
I kind of sort of backed into it.

02:30.720 --> 02:34.235
- Excuse me?
- Okay. Poor choice of words.

02:35.160 --> 02:39.472
When we first met, I found myself falling
into his... What do you call it?

02:39.680 --> 02:40.999
Futon?

02:41.160 --> 02:43.674
No, no, his manner
of expressing himself.

02:43.840 --> 02:46.115
Tone, gestures.
Like talking to a Southerner...

02:46.280 --> 02:50.478
...you start saying "y'all" and
"grits" and "tobaccy."

02:50.640 --> 02:52.437
- Oh, Charlie.
- It's harmless.

02:52.600 --> 02:55.319
He throws me work. I want
him to feel comfortable with me.

02:55.640 --> 02:58.996
And how far do you go to
make him feel comfortable?

02:59.200 --> 03:02.988
Don't worry. I just sparkle a little bit.
I don't burst into flames.

03:04.400 --> 03:08.951
- I don't know how you live with yourself.
- Actually, I don't live with myself.

03:09.160 --> 03:11.196
I have a significant other.

03:12.280 --> 03:13.554
- What?
- We're both invited...

03:13.720 --> 03:15.631
...to a cocktail party Saturday night.

03:16.920 --> 03:18.399
What?

03:25.880 --> 03:27.996
- No. Absolutely not.
- Oh, come on.

03:28.160 --> 03:30.071
You always complain
we don't hang out.

03:30.280 --> 03:33.158
I didn't mean I wanted to date you.

03:33.360 --> 03:36.511
You don't think I'm gonna go to a gay
cocktail party stag, do you?

03:36.680 --> 03:38.033
The way I sparkle?

03:38.240 --> 03:41.198
I'm not going to be your gay lover
so you can make a few bucks.

03:41.400 --> 03:44.710
Okay, first of all, it's considerably
more than a few bucks.

03:44.920 --> 03:47.957
This man was responsible for almost
half my income last year.

03:48.120 --> 03:50.998
And that's the half
I didn't gamble away.

03:51.160 --> 03:53.230
And second of all,
you're not just my lover...

03:53.400 --> 03:56.073
...you're my life partner.
That makes you special.

03:56.280 --> 03:59.556
Forget it. It's immoral and deceitful,
and I don't want any part of it.

03:59.720 --> 04:02.314
What's the big deal?
Gay people pretend to be straight.

04:02.520 --> 04:04.158
They don't wanna be discriminated.

04:04.360 --> 04:08.319
And neither do I. The minute this guy
finds out I'm a breeder, I'm history.

04:08.960 --> 04:12.236
I don't care. If you wanna engage
in a fraudulent escapade...

04:12.440 --> 04:15.034
...have one of your oafish poker
buddies be your partner.

04:15.240 --> 04:18.596
You see? You see? Right there.
Escapade. Oafish.

04:18.760 --> 04:21.512
What poker buddy
of mine talks like that?

04:21.680 --> 04:24.672
But you, a couple of squirts of
Paco Rabanne, you're good to go.

04:25.320 --> 04:27.436
Having a reasonable
command of English...

04:27.600 --> 04:29.909
...isn't the exclusive domain
of the gay community.

04:30.080 --> 04:32.913
Listen to you.
You're just making my point.

04:33.080 --> 04:35.469
Forget it. You're asking too much.

04:35.640 --> 04:37.710
Oh, really?

04:37.880 --> 04:42.317
Was it too much when you showed
up on my doorstep, looking for a place?

04:42.480 --> 04:44.198
- Charlie.
- Too much when I took in...

04:44.360 --> 04:47.113
...your son on weekends and holidays?
- This isn't fair.

04:47.320 --> 04:49.629
Too much when
I set up a college fund for Jake?

04:49.840 --> 04:52.673
- You set up a college fund for Jake?
- You bet I will.

04:53.480 --> 04:56.472
Unless, of course, my income
were to suddenly decline.

04:56.680 --> 04:58.830
I can't believe you would sink so low.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.434
To actually use emotional
and financial blackmail...

05:01.640 --> 05:02.993
- You're both in my will.
- Really?

05:03.200 --> 05:04.599
First thing Monday.

05:06.960 --> 05:08.951
All right. But I want it on the record...

05:09.120 --> 05:11.111
...I'm doing this under protest.
- Noted.

05:11.280 --> 05:13.430
If we're gonna be a couple,
I'm the husband.

05:14.160 --> 05:16.196
Well, who's gonna believe
you're the husband?

05:16.400 --> 05:18.960
Of the two of us, I'm the
only one who's been a husband.

05:19.160 --> 05:21.993
You really thought you were
the husband in your marriage?

05:23.920 --> 05:29.278
Nevertheless, I'm going to be
the husband in this one.

05:32.360 --> 05:34.271
Well, la-di-da.

05:37.240 --> 05:39.356
- Thanks for babysitting, Rose.
- My pleasure.

05:39.520 --> 05:41.158
Where are you guys going?

05:41.320 --> 05:42.878
To a little party.

05:43.280 --> 05:45.794
And you're taking Alan
instead of a date?

05:45.960 --> 05:48.474
Yeah, well, funny story about that.

05:48.800 --> 05:51.234
Okay, let's get this over with.

05:53.120 --> 05:54.712
You're wearing that?

05:54.880 --> 05:57.075
What's wrong with it?
You liked it in the store.

05:57.280 --> 05:58.872
It looked different in the store.

06:00.200 --> 06:02.668
Well, it was on sale. I can't return it.

06:03.400 --> 06:06.358
- Dad, can we order pizza for dinner?
- No. Eat something healthy.

06:06.520 --> 06:08.158
You want me to change, just tell me.

06:08.360 --> 06:09.918
- Don't change.
- You don't like it.

06:10.120 --> 06:12.156
I didn't say that.

06:12.360 --> 06:13.952
I think you look very nice, Alan.

06:14.160 --> 06:16.958
Thank you. See?
That's all I needed to hear.

06:17.160 --> 06:20.550
- Well, you heard it. Now, come on.
- You know, I'm only doing this for you.

06:20.720 --> 06:22.836
- I know.
- Could you show a little appreciation?

06:23.000 --> 06:25.195
How about I show you a little
smack on the head?

06:25.360 --> 06:28.193
That's your answer
for everything, isn't it?

06:29.080 --> 06:30.354
What is that about?

06:30.520 --> 06:33.956
I don't know, but one of them
suffers from erectile dysfunction.

06:35.640 --> 06:37.870
Dad said we could order a pizza.

06:40.360 --> 06:44.638
Would you please not walk so far in
front of me? I'm not your concubine.

06:44.800 --> 06:46.074
I'm sorry.

06:46.280 --> 06:48.271
What, are you ashamed of me?

06:49.280 --> 06:50.554
A little bit.

06:57.240 --> 07:00.038
Oh, boy. Charlie, we need to talk.

07:00.240 --> 07:02.595
For the last time, you look stunning.

07:02.800 --> 07:04.870
No, we... We need
to get our stories straight.

07:05.040 --> 07:06.632
- What stories?
- We're a couple.

07:06.800 --> 07:09.030
How long have we been together?
How did we meet?

07:09.240 --> 07:12.550
Okay, fine. I met you in Thailand
and bought you from a guy.

07:13.320 --> 07:16.790
I'm serious. If we're gonna pull this off,
we need to be convincing.

07:16.960 --> 07:19.030
A favorite song?
Cute names for each other?

07:19.200 --> 07:22.112
I mean, I don't even know if
we're dog people or cat people.

07:22.320 --> 07:26.518
I forgot to tell you: The guy I bought you
from had your vocal chords removed.

07:26.960 --> 07:31.511
- Charlie. I'm so glad you could make it.
- Oh, please. How could I not?

07:31.720 --> 07:34.109
And you must be Alan. Welcome.

07:34.280 --> 07:36.191
I'm the husband.

07:36.760 --> 07:39.513
No, he's not. Stop saying that.

07:39.680 --> 07:43.070
Listen to you two ladies.
Come on. I'll get you a drink.

07:43.240 --> 07:44.832
Appletinis.

07:45.040 --> 07:46.951
So how did you lovebirds meet?

07:52.240 --> 07:54.754
Funny you should ask.
We were at the Coffee Bean...

07:54.920 --> 07:59.835
...you know, the one in Larchmont
Village, where the pastries are to die for.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.276
Anyway, we both
ordered a soy latte...

08:03.440 --> 08:09.151
...when the first one came up, we both
reached for it, and our hands touched.

08:10.040 --> 08:12.110
Oh, that is so romantic.

08:12.320 --> 08:15.437
Yeah, it was one of those moments
that seems to go on forever.

08:15.600 --> 08:17.113
Like this one.

08:17.320 --> 08:19.515
- Are you starting?
- No.

08:19.720 --> 08:22.951
Because I swear to God, I will walk
out that door and get in a cab.

08:24.640 --> 08:27.632
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry, what?

08:28.000 --> 08:30.230
I'm sorry...

08:30.400 --> 08:32.231
...pookie.

08:32.760 --> 08:34.193
Finish your story, Alan.

08:34.520 --> 08:37.956
Well, okay. So... So there we are...

08:38.120 --> 08:43.114
...our hands are touching, and we
look into each other's eyes...

08:43.280 --> 08:46.716
...this one panics, spills coffee
over one of his hideous bowling shirts.

08:46.920 --> 08:50.469
The only gay man in America
who dresses like Ralph Kramden.

08:51.200 --> 08:53.111
To the moon, Alan.

08:53.280 --> 08:57.990
Anyhoo, so I took him back to my
condo to "hand wash his shirt"...

08:58.160 --> 09:00.310
...and, abracadabra,
hocus-pocus, here we are.

09:00.520 --> 09:04.035
- That's a delicious story.
- Yeah, isn't it yummy?

09:05.840 --> 09:12.313
Yeah, it kills me every time.

09:16.760 --> 09:19.320
There's someone you just
have to meet. Don't go away.

09:19.480 --> 09:21.550
Okey-dokey, artichokey.

09:22.600 --> 09:25.797
You've gotta pull back a little.
You're gonna set off the smoke alarm.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.389
- What do you mean?
- I mean, if you flame any more...

09:28.560 --> 09:30.312
...you'll light the drapes on fire.

09:30.520 --> 09:32.636
What about you?
"Okey-dokey, artichokey"?

09:32.800 --> 09:35.234
What are you, the Jolly Gay Giant?

09:35.400 --> 09:39.393
I want you both to meet someone
very special to me. Charlie, Alan...

09:39.560 --> 09:42.711
...this is my very patient
and very forgiving ex-wife, Pamela.

09:42.920 --> 09:44.831
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

09:45.040 --> 09:47.031
Hi. Wow, you were married?

09:47.240 --> 09:49.435
It was before I'd gotten
a grip on my sexuality.

09:49.640 --> 09:52.154
But not before you got
a grip on my cousin Walt.

09:53.840 --> 09:55.910
Well, I can see why you
gave marriage a shot.

09:56.080 --> 09:58.548
Pamela, you are a
breathtakingly beautiful woman.

09:58.760 --> 10:00.432
Why, thank you, Charlie.

10:00.600 --> 10:03.717
Why do all the cute ones
have to be married or gay?

10:03.880 --> 10:07.156
Back off, sister. I caught this fish.

10:12.840 --> 10:17.550
- Gonna tell me what's bothering you?
- Lf you don't know, no point discussing.

10:17.760 --> 10:19.239
Fine.

10:20.720 --> 10:22.312
You ignored me the whole night.

10:24.080 --> 10:26.719
A party where I don't know anyone,
and you abandoned me.

10:26.920 --> 10:29.388
Alan, listen closely.

10:29.560 --> 10:32.120
It wasn't a real date.

10:33.200 --> 10:35.509
Not the point. I was stuck
playing truth or dare...

10:35.680 --> 10:38.592
...with your friend Eric and nine
producers from <i>Will & Grace...</i>

10:38.760 --> 10:41.672
...while you had a wonderful
time talking to his hot ex-wife.

10:41.880 --> 10:43.871
- I was just being polite.
- Oh, please.

10:44.040 --> 10:47.430
- I saw the way you were looking at her.
- What, I can't look?

10:47.640 --> 10:49.835
Not when you're supposed
to be with me.

10:50.040 --> 10:52.031
How many appletinis
did you drink tonight?

10:52.240 --> 10:55.357
Never you mind about that.
So... So, what are you gonna do?

10:55.520 --> 10:58.830
Out yourself as a straight man so you
can sleep with your little Pamela?

10:59.040 --> 11:02.237
No, no. That would mess
everything up with Eric.

11:02.960 --> 11:05.155
Unless I convince him...

11:05.320 --> 11:08.312
...that she temporarily
flipped me back to the home team.

11:08.520 --> 11:10.636
Oh, if you're gonna go, just go.

11:10.800 --> 11:13.792
Alan, eat something.
Toast, a waffle. Anything absorbent.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.877
Don't blame this on the liquor.

11:16.720 --> 11:18.950
Okay, here's what I can do.

11:19.120 --> 11:21.031
She and I are going
shopping tomorrow.

11:21.200 --> 11:23.953
I'll tell her I'm bisexual,
and then make my move.

11:24.160 --> 11:25.798
So you're gonna cheat on me?

11:26.000 --> 11:27.433
No, that's not cheating.

11:27.640 --> 11:31.269
- How do you figure?
- Because we're not really gay.

11:31.760 --> 11:34.593
Then how can you be bi?

11:37.040 --> 11:38.792
Shut up.

11:43.240 --> 11:45.595
Okay, well, good night.

11:45.800 --> 11:49.793
- Aren't you gonna ask?
- No. Jake told me.

11:54.720 --> 11:56.836
Oh, this is a cute top.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.912
I'm more a bottom man myself.

12:00.080 --> 12:02.514
I'll bet you are.

12:05.520 --> 12:07.078
- Too slutty?
- Haven't you heard?

12:07.240 --> 12:09.276
Slutty is the new black.

12:09.440 --> 12:11.590
Oh, you.

12:12.240 --> 12:17.075
Is there some special, young vagina
enthusiast you'll be taking that off for?

12:17.280 --> 12:20.078
I wish. Can you keep a little secret?

12:20.280 --> 12:22.271
I'm keeping a big one right now.

12:22.480 --> 12:24.948
I haven't been with a man
in almost a year.

12:25.160 --> 12:27.754
Oh, no. Color me sympathetic.

12:27.960 --> 12:31.032
I don't miss dating. That's lies and
pretense. I do miss the sex.

12:31.240 --> 12:36.109
Really? Well, what, specifically,
do you miss? And tell me slowly.

12:37.000 --> 12:40.879
The feel of a man's hot breath
on the back of my neck.

12:41.040 --> 12:44.715
His rough hands pulling me
to him and just taking me.

12:44.880 --> 12:47.235
Of course, I don't need to tell you.

12:48.240 --> 12:50.959
No, but I'm so glad you did.

12:51.120 --> 12:54.635
Isn't it funny that I can only be
this honest with a gay man?

12:54.800 --> 12:56.677
Yeah, it's a riot.

12:57.080 --> 13:00.959
Straight men only want one thing, and
they'll tell any number of lies to get it.

13:01.160 --> 13:03.993
- The dogs.
- Straight women are so competitive...

13:04.160 --> 13:06.196
...they'll use anything
you say against you.

13:06.400 --> 13:08.277
The bitches.

13:08.480 --> 13:11.756
Gay women only want one thing, and
they'll lie worse than straight men.

13:11.960 --> 13:13.916
Strange, because
they've already got it.

13:14.120 --> 13:16.634
Oh, you, come here.

13:16.800 --> 13:21.271
Oh, that's the other thing about
gay men. You're so hilarious.

13:21.440 --> 13:24.193
Yeah, we're like clowns
who smell nice.

13:26.360 --> 13:28.271
You know, these are pretty.

13:31.400 --> 13:35.109
It's pretty sheer. Eric hated it when he
could see my nipples. That a gay thing?

13:35.440 --> 13:39.797
Well, I can't speak for the community,
but I myself am nutty for nipples.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.592
Let's try it on.

13:41.760 --> 13:43.273
Okey-dokey, artichokey.

13:44.920 --> 13:46.911
All right. Hold this.

13:47.080 --> 13:48.752
Okay.

13:48.920 --> 13:50.956
What do you think?
With or without the bra?

13:52.000 --> 13:54.230
I don't know.
You're the one with nipple issues.

13:54.440 --> 13:57.000
All right, then. Without.

13:57.440 --> 13:59.829
Yes. Definitely without.

14:00.360 --> 14:01.793
Am I starting to sag?

14:03.280 --> 14:05.430
What... I'm sorry,
were you talking to me?

14:05.640 --> 14:07.232
Am I hanging a bit low?

14:07.440 --> 14:10.830
I don't know. Go like this:

14:11.440 --> 14:14.352
- Now go like this:
- Stop it. Give me the blouse.

14:16.160 --> 14:17.673
I am a woman, Charles.

14:17.840 --> 14:19.796
- Wanna see my nipples?
- No.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.752
Why not? You made me look at yours.

14:21.920 --> 14:25.196
God, you are so frisky.
How does Alan ever put up with you?

14:25.400 --> 14:27.550
How does his mother
put up with him?

14:27.760 --> 14:29.193
Oh, boy.

14:29.400 --> 14:33.632
Charles, didn't I ask you to confine
your debauchery to outlet stores?

14:33.840 --> 14:37.389
Pamela, this is my mother, Evelyn.
Mom, this is Pamela.

14:37.560 --> 14:41.269
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you. Your son is adorable.

14:41.440 --> 14:44.273
That seems to be
the conventional wisdom.

14:44.440 --> 14:48.035
I met him and his partner last night,
but we immediately hit it off.

14:48.200 --> 14:50.953
- I'm sorry. His partner?
- Alan, his lover.

14:51.160 --> 14:52.832
His lover?

14:53.520 --> 14:55.351
God, I'm not outing you, am I?

14:55.520 --> 14:59.479
Oh, no, no, no. Mom knows
all about me and Alan. Right, Mom?

15:00.440 --> 15:04.991
Of course. Alan's almost
like a son to me.

15:05.200 --> 15:09.478
My ex's parents were not supportive
when he came out of the closet.

15:09.640 --> 15:12.518
Oh, what a shame. What does he do?

15:12.720 --> 15:15.154
He's in advertising.
Charlie writes jingles for him.

15:15.360 --> 15:20.195
Oh, I see. One hand
moisturizes the other.

15:22.640 --> 15:25.552
No, the only time Charlie
was ever in the closet...

15:25.720 --> 15:28.951
...was when he was a little boy
trying on my hats and underwear...

15:29.120 --> 15:32.192
...belting out the entire score
of <i>Hello, Dolly!</i>

15:32.400 --> 15:34.960
It was <i>Mame,</i> Mom.

15:35.160 --> 15:39.073
In fact, if anything, his lifestyle
has brought us even closer.

15:39.240 --> 15:41.708
We cook together,
we shop together...

15:41.880 --> 15:45.839
...we go to all kinds of parties
and charity events together.

15:46.040 --> 15:50.431
Come to think of it, I have entered us
in an Alzheimer's walkathon this Sunday.

15:50.600 --> 15:52.113
Sunday isn't really good for me.

15:52.280 --> 15:53.918
But you will be there anyway...

15:54.080 --> 16:00.349
...because we support each other in all
our little causes, and you love me. Right?

16:01.560 --> 16:03.073
Right.

16:03.520 --> 16:05.158
Say it.

16:08.520 --> 16:10.112
I love you, Mom.

16:10.320 --> 16:12.629
And I love you too.

16:12.800 --> 16:14.392
Eight a.m. Sunday.

16:14.560 --> 16:19.076
I'll buy us matching tracksuits.
It'll be cute.

16:20.600 --> 16:23.239
- Lovely to meet you, Pamela.
- Bye.

16:23.560 --> 16:27.519
If I didn't know you were gay, meeting
your mother would've convinced me.

16:27.680 --> 16:30.638
Okay, that's it.
I can't do this anymore.

16:30.800 --> 16:33.678
You can't stop shopping.
I've gotta find you something slutty.

16:33.880 --> 16:36.155
I've already got something
slutty in my pants.

16:36.360 --> 16:38.555
- You're terrible.
- Pamela, listen to me.

16:38.760 --> 16:43.834
I'm not gay. I am completely,
100 percent, militantly heterosexual...

16:44.000 --> 16:48.039
...and I find you incredibly attractive.
- Okay. I understand.

16:48.240 --> 16:51.630
- You do?
- Of course. I went through this with Eric.

16:51.800 --> 16:54.792
He wanted badly to be straight,
and he suffered so much before...

16:54.960 --> 16:57.599
...he was able to finally accept
himself for who he is.

16:57.800 --> 17:01.509
Oh, no. I accept myself for who
I am. I am a lying horndog.

17:01.680 --> 17:04.512
- Charlie.
- Lf I were a straight man...

17:04.680 --> 17:07.240
...would you find me attractive?
- That's hypothetical.

17:07.400 --> 17:09.789
Play along. Humor me.
If I were straight...

17:10.000 --> 17:11.592
I'd do you in a heartbeat.

17:11.800 --> 17:13.869
Oh, good. Come with me.

17:14.040 --> 17:16.679
Charlie, don't do this.
You don't have to prove anything.

17:16.880 --> 17:18.790
Oh, but I do.

17:20.440 --> 17:22.271
Now, come here.

17:23.599 --> 17:25.909
You don't have to be
straight to be a good kisser.

17:26.079 --> 17:29.277
I know, I know. Just wait.

17:32.560 --> 17:34.357
Well...?

17:35.520 --> 17:38.751
Give me a minute. I'm under some
pressure here. I just saw my mother.

17:38.920 --> 17:41.036
Would it help if you thought of Alan?

17:41.200 --> 17:45.955
Oh, great. Why don't you just
roll up a newspaper and hit it?

17:46.120 --> 17:47.997
Charlie, sweetheart, it's okay.

17:48.160 --> 17:50.720
No, it's not. I am a straight man.

17:50.880 --> 17:54.395
I've always been a straight man,
and I'll always be a straight man.

17:54.560 --> 17:58.758
Well, you'll forgive me, darling,
but you seem to have a gay man's penis.

17:59.960 --> 18:02.076
Come on, let's go look at shoes.

18:03.040 --> 18:07.079
It's a straight man's penis.
It's just having a bad day.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.070
- Hey.
- Oh, I thought you'd never come home.

18:12.240 --> 18:13.832
- We have to talk.
- Not now.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.956
I need to drink beer, scratch my ass...

18:16.120 --> 18:19.032
...and watch a whole bunch
of girl-on-girl porn.

18:20.720 --> 18:23.871
- Hello, Charlie.
- Eric. What are you doing here?

18:25.720 --> 18:29.156
I came over to talk to you about a
new account, and you weren't here, so...

18:29.360 --> 18:31.430
So he invited me to Big Sur
for the weekend.

18:33.280 --> 18:34.599
It's not what it sounds like.

18:34.800 --> 18:39.237
Yes, it is. He looked into my eyes,
told me I had a tight little breadbasket.

18:39.760 --> 18:41.193
No.

18:41.360 --> 18:44.989
Look, the other night at the party, there
was a lot of friction between you...

18:45.160 --> 18:47.674
...and I'm really sorry.

18:47.880 --> 18:51.555
Yeah, I'll bet you're really sorry.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.036
How do you expect me
to keep working for you?

18:55.240 --> 18:57.470
Gosh, I hope you will.
I'll make it up to you.

18:57.680 --> 19:01.150
How? How could you possibly
make up for this incredible betrayal?

19:01.360 --> 19:04.272
- I'll get you more money.
- Done. Get out.

19:05.080 --> 19:06.877
Bye, Alan.

19:08.080 --> 19:09.399
Thanks for the sweater.

19:11.240 --> 19:15.791
- He gave you a sweater?
- Cashmere. Very stylish. And thank you.

19:15.960 --> 19:19.794
- For what? I didn't get you anything.
- You stood up for our relationship.

19:19.960 --> 19:24.192
What relationship?
Alan, we're not gay.

19:24.720 --> 19:28.156
No, but if we were, you wouldn't
let anybody steal me away.

19:28.320 --> 19:30.311
And I think that's sweet.

19:31.280 --> 19:33.316
You need to stop this.

19:33.480 --> 19:36.517
I was just trying to get more
money out of him, and that's all.

19:36.720 --> 19:39.951
Whatever you say. Pookie.

19:42.480 --> 19:44.436
Is the breadbasket
the front or the back?

19:44.600 --> 19:48.639
- The back.
- Oh, good. It wasn't just a line.

19:53.240 --> 19:55.231
Pick it up, Charlie. We're lagging.

19:55.400 --> 19:58.073
Gimme a break.
I haven't even been to bed yet.

19:58.240 --> 20:01.357
Well, perhaps it's time for you
to reexamine your club-hopping...

20:01.520 --> 20:04.592
...popper-sniffing, disco lifestyle.

20:04.760 --> 20:06.876
I explained about that.

20:07.040 --> 20:11.511
It doesn't matter, darling.
You're here, you're queer. I'm used to it.
