WEBVTT

00:02.001 --> 00:02.972
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:03.003 --> 00:04.743
I'VE JUST FINISHED
YOUR QUARTERLY TAXES, MIKE.

00:04.772 --> 00:07.212
YOUR BUSINESS
IS IN GREAT SHAPE.

00:07.241 --> 00:09.281
ONE MORE YEAR LIKE THIS,
YOU COULD RETIRE.

00:09.310 --> 00:11.180
KNOCK WOOD.

00:11.212 --> 00:12.282
I REMEMBER THERE WAS
A WHOLE LOT MORE HAIR

00:12.313 --> 00:13.283
ON THAT WOOD.

00:13.314 --> 00:15.784
YEAH, WELL, YOU'RE NO
LENNY KRAVITZ, MY FRIEND.

00:15.816 --> 00:17.786
LOOK, ARE YOU STILL WORKING
LIKE A DOG,

00:17.818 --> 00:19.518
OR ARE YOU GOING TO
GET A LIFE?

00:19.553 --> 00:21.193
OH, MAN, I GOT A LIFE.

00:21.222 --> 00:23.422
I ACTUALLY SEE LIGHT
AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL.

00:23.457 --> 00:25.687
YOU KNOW, YOU WORK AS HARD
AS I DO 24/7,

00:25.726 --> 00:28.156
I FINALLY DECIDED
I'M GOING TO PACK IT UP

00:28.196 --> 00:29.456
AND GO AROUND THE WORLD.

00:29.497 --> 00:31.227
GET OUT OF HERE.

00:31.265 --> 00:33.625
GOT A 22-YEAR-OLD GIRLFRIEND
AND A NEW BOAT.

00:33.667 --> 00:36.167
WOW. 22? WHAT'S THE NAME
OF THIS BOAT,

00:36.204 --> 00:37.374
THE S.S. VIAGRA?

00:37.405 --> 00:40.535
WELL, LET ME BE THE FIRST
TO CONGRATULATE YOU.

00:40.574 --> 00:43.214
I GOT TO TELL YOU,
I'VE NEVER FELT SO ALIVE.

00:43.244 --> 00:44.614
WELL, GOOD FOR YOU.

00:44.645 --> 00:46.305
WE'RE JUST
ABOUT FINISHED HERE.

00:46.347 --> 00:48.247
I SAY WE GO AHEAD
AND GET A BEER.

00:48.282 --> 00:50.182
NO, I'M GOING TO HAVE TO
TAKE A RAIN CHECK.

00:50.218 --> 00:51.688
I WANT TO GET HOME
TO THE WIFE AND KIDS.

00:51.719 --> 00:53.519
ONE BEER IS NOT
GOING TO KILL YOU.

00:53.554 --> 00:56.094
MMM...

00:59.160 --> 01:00.630
HEY, BABY.

01:00.661 --> 01:02.531
OH, THANK GOD YOUR HOME.

01:02.563 --> 01:04.333
I'M SO SORRY ABOUT TOM.

01:04.364 --> 01:06.525
WHY ARE YOU SORRY
FOR TOM?

01:06.567 --> 01:08.397
HE'S TRAVELING
AROUND THE WORLD

01:08.436 --> 01:10.236
WITH A 22-YEAR-OLD
GIRLFRIEND.

01:10.271 --> 01:12.211
I FEEL SORRY
FOR HIS CHIROPRACTOR.

01:12.240 --> 01:14.510
HE TOLD ME HE NEVER FELT
SO ALIVE BEFORE.

01:14.542 --> 01:16.142
THAT'S GOOD...

01:16.144 --> 01:17.714
BECAUSE HE'S DEAD.

01:23.517 --> 01:25.417
DEAD? WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

01:25.453 --> 01:27.423
BABY, HIS ASSISTANT
JUST CALLED.

01:27.455 --> 01:30.515
APPARENTLY, FIVE MINUTES
AFTER YOU LEFT,

01:30.558 --> 01:31.888
TOM WENT OUT FOR LUNCH.

01:31.925 --> 01:33.685
HE GOT RUN OVER BY A CAB.

01:33.727 --> 01:35.357
HE WAS KILLED INSTANTLY.

01:35.396 --> 01:36.626
BY A CAB?

01:36.664 --> 01:39.874
IT'S HARD FOR BROTHERS
TO CATCH CABS IN NEW YORK.

01:39.900 --> 01:40.900
I KNOW.

01:40.934 --> 01:42.444
THIS IS SO WEIRD.

01:42.470 --> 01:43.800
YOU KNOW,
I WAS JUST WITH HIM.

01:43.837 --> 01:45.667
HE INVITED ME TO GO OUT
FOR A BEER.

01:45.706 --> 01:47.406
HE TOLD ME
IT WOULDN'T KILL ME.

01:47.441 --> 01:49.841
YEAH, WELL,
IT CERTAINLY KILLED HIM.

01:49.877 --> 01:52.447
JAY, THIS IS FREAKY,
YOU KNOW?

01:52.480 --> 01:55.850
IT'S, LIKE, I FEEL LIKE
I SHOULD BE DEAD, TOO.

01:55.883 --> 01:58.493
I WAS THIS CLOSE
TO GOING WITH HIM.

01:58.519 --> 01:59.789
THANK GOD YOU DIDN'T.

01:59.820 --> 02:02.490
I KNOW.
I MEAN, IT'S SO SAD.

02:02.523 --> 02:04.793
IT'S LIKE HE HAD
HALF HIS LIFE

02:04.825 --> 02:07.495
AND HER WHOLE LIFE
AHEAD OF HIM.

02:10.663 --> 02:13.604
BABY, I'M GLAD
I CAME HOME TO YOU.

02:13.634 --> 02:17.344
THIS REALLY MAKES ME

02:40.761 --> 02:43.401
I GET IT. I GET IT.

02:43.431 --> 02:44.231

02:44.232 --> 02:46.332
FROM NOW ON,
I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU

02:46.367 --> 02:48.337
HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU,
YOU AND THE KIDS.

02:48.369 --> 02:49.739
YOU KNOW WHY?

02:49.770 --> 02:51.740
BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW
WHEN IT'S OVER.

02:51.772 --> 02:53.572
I LOVE YOU, BABY.

I JUST WANTED TO SAY

03:22.736 --> 03:24.836
WITH ACTION, WITH FLOWERS.

03:24.872 --> 03:27.582
BUT, BABY,
THERE'S SO MANY OF THEM.

03:27.608 --> 03:30.808
HEY, I DIDN'T WANT TO SAY
I LOVE YOU A LITTLE.

03:30.844 --> 03:33.614

03:39.887 --> 03:41.357
WELL, HOW LONG
DOES IT TAKE THEM

03:41.389 --> 03:42.589
TO WALK HOME FROM SCHOOL?

03:42.623 --> 03:45.533
I DON'T KNOW, MICHAEL.
5, 10 MINUTES?

03:45.559 --> 03:47.529
SOMETHING HAPPENED TO THEM.

03:47.561 --> 03:50.361
I FEEL IT.
I FEEL IT RIGHT HERE.

03:50.398 --> 03:53.768
THEY GOT HIT BY A CAB.
I KNOW IT.

03:53.801 --> 03:55.301
CALM DOWN, OKAY?

06:46.707 --> 06:49.537

HOW ARE ALL FOUR OF US
GOING TO FIT IN THE SIDECAR?

08:01.014 --> 08:02.724
WE DON'T HAVE TO.

08:02.750 --> 08:04.720
COME HERE AND LOOK
ACROSS THE STREET. HUH?

08:04.752 --> 08:05.952
OH, MY GOD.

08:05.986 --> 08:07.656
WHAT IS THAT?

08:07.688 --> 08:08.818
IT'S AN RV --

08:08.856 --> 08:11.626
A 39-FOOT
BLUE BIRD WANDER LODGE.

08:11.659 --> 08:14.599
IT'S LIKE AN APARTMENT
ON WHEELS. THIS IS GREAT.

08:14.628 --> 08:16.858
WE'RE GOING TO PULL
THE MOTORCYCLE BEHIND US,

08:16.897 --> 08:18.967
AND WE'LL TAKE IT
WHEREVER WE'RE GOING.

08:18.999 --> 08:22.569
I DON'T EVER WANT TO BE AWAY
FROM MY FAMILY AGAIN.

08:22.603 --> 08:25.273
EVEN WHEN WE GO POTTY?

08:25.305 --> 08:27.205
EXCEPT THEN.

08:36.616 --> 08:38.587
OKAY, WHO DID WHAT?

08:38.586 --> 08:41.986
IT'S NOT US, IT'S DAD.
WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT HIM.

08:42.022 --> 08:44.732
HE'S CRAZY.

08:44.758 --> 08:47.628
YEAH, MOM,
LIKE THIS MORNING.

08:47.661 --> 08:50.061
HE SAID THANKS
TO HIS WORKOUT,

08:50.097 --> 08:52.227
HIS BUTT CHEEKS
ARE SO STRONG,

08:52.265 --> 08:53.595
HE COULD CRACK WALNUTS.

08:55.368 --> 08:56.868
AND?

08:56.904 --> 08:58.614
HE DID. WANT ONE?

09:00.373 --> 09:02.813
AND THIS MORNING,
HE WOKE ME UP AT 6:00

09:02.843 --> 09:04.343
SO WE CAN GO LIE
ON THE GRASS

09:04.377 --> 09:05.947
AND WATCH THE SUNRISE.

09:05.979 --> 09:08.249
WHAT IS SO WRONG
WITH THAT?

09:08.281 --> 09:09.981
THE SPRINKLERS WERE ON.

09:10.017 --> 09:12.317
MOM,
I THINK HE'S LOSING IT.

09:12.352 --> 09:15.322
YOU GUYS, YOUR FATHER WENT
TO THE FUNERAL YESTERDAY

09:15.355 --> 09:16.885
AND HE HASN'T CRIED YET.

09:16.924 --> 09:18.894
HE HASN'T GOTTEN HIS GRIEF OUT,

09:18.926 --> 09:22.326
SO HE'S GOING TO BE ACTING
A LITTLE STRANGE FOR A WHILE,

09:22.362 --> 09:24.332
BUT IN TIME,
THINGS WILL GET BACK TO NORMAL.

09:24.364 --> 09:25.734
YOU'LL SEE.

09:25.766 --> 09:27.636
ALL RIGHT.

09:27.668 --> 09:30.338
HEY, GUYS.

IT'S KIND OF LIKE BILLY DEE.

10:20.320 --> 10:23.290

WHEN HE SAYS,

10:23.323 --> 10:25.763

10:25.793 --> 10:28.763
WITHOUT SOMEONE YOU LOVE
TO SHARE IT WITH."

FROM HAIRCULES FOR MEN --

MR. CULES HIMSELF SAID HE WANTS
TO TAKE A PICTURE OF ME

10:46.714 --> 10:48.324
AND PUT IT IN THE BROCHURE

10:48.348 --> 10:51.848
BETWEEN WILLIAM SHATNER
AND STEVE HARVEY.

10:57.891 --> 11:00.261
MICHAEL,
HAVE YOU GIVEN ANY THOUGHT

11:00.293 --> 11:02.733
AS TO WHY YOU'RE DOING THIS?

11:02.730 --> 11:04.160
YEAH, I'LL TELL YOU WHY,

11:04.197 --> 11:05.897
BECAUSE I WENT
TO TOM'S FUNERAL

11:05.933 --> 11:07.903
AND I LOOKED AT HIM
IN THE CASKET,

11:07.935 --> 11:09.295
AND HE LOOKED HORRIBLE.

11:09.336 --> 11:12.366
THAT'S BECAUSE HE WAS DEAD.

11:12.405 --> 11:15.235
NO, HE WAS BALD AND DEAD,

11:15.275 --> 11:17.745
AND THAT'S A BAD COMBINATION.

11:19.279 --> 11:22.149
AND I STARTED THINKING,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

11:22.182 --> 11:23.382
IF HE HAD HAIR,

11:23.416 --> 11:25.846
MAYBE THE CAB
WOULD HAVE SAW HIM.

11:28.188 --> 11:30.188
IT MIGHT HAVE
CUSHIONED THE FALL.

11:30.223 --> 11:32.163
YOU KNOW, WHEN HE FELL --
BOOP --

11:32.192 --> 11:34.162
AND THE HAIR
JUST POPPED BACK UP.

11:34.194 --> 11:37.264
BABE, ARE YOU SURE YOU
WANT TO WEAR THAT, THOUGH?

11:37.297 --> 11:39.297
YES, YES, BECAUSE UNLIKE TOM,

11:39.332 --> 11:42.302
I'M GOING TO DO EVERYTHING
THAT MAKES ME FEEL GOOD,

11:42.335 --> 11:45.305
AND RIGHT NOW HAIR
MAKES ME FEEL WONDERFUL.

11:45.338 --> 11:48.238
OKAY, OKAY, I UNDERSTAND
AND I SUPPORT YOU.

11:48.275 --> 11:51.235
GOOD, BECAUSE I'M ALSO
GOING TO SELL THE BUSINESS.

12:01.922 --> 12:05.462
WHAT? MICHAEL, HAVE YOU
BEEN INHALING THE GLUE

12:05.492 --> 12:07.062
FROM THAT WIG?

12:07.094 --> 12:10.534
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT,
SELL THE BUSINESS?

12:10.563 --> 12:13.403
I WANT TO SPEND MORE TIME
WITH MY FAMILY.

12:13.433 --> 12:16.443
AND, BABY, IT'S NOT A WIG,
IT'S A HAIRPIECE.

12:16.469 --> 12:18.909
WHAT ABOUT MONEY, MICHAEL?

12:18.939 --> 12:20.809
AND IT IS A WIG

12:20.808 --> 12:23.478
BECAUSE A HAIRPIECE
HAS TO ATTACH

12:23.510 --> 12:25.850
TO ANOTHER PIECE OF HAIR.

12:25.879 --> 12:28.349
WE DON'T NEED ANY MORE MONEY.

WE HAVE EACH OTHER.

12:31.518 --> 12:32.918
AND ARE YOU SURE?

12:32.953 --> 12:35.923
BECAUSE HAIRCULES SAYS
IT'S A HAIRPIECE.

12:35.956 --> 12:38.556
OH, FOR GOD SAKES,
MICHAEL, IT'S A HAT.

12:38.591 --> 12:41.331

IS A BRIM

LONG AND HARD ABOUT THIS

TO SELL ANYTHING.

12:48.401 --> 12:49.471

12:49.502 --> 12:51.372
YOU'RE BEING
A LITTLE IRRATIONAL.

12:51.404 --> 12:53.074
YOUR BUSINESS
IS IMPORTANT TO YOU.

FROM THE GROUND UP.

12:54.541 --> 12:57.011
YOU KNOW WHAT, JAY?
I COULD BE PERFECTLY HAPPY

12:57.044 --> 12:59.084
IF I NEVER WORKED ANOTHER DAY
IN MY LIFE.

12:59.112 --> 13:00.412
WORK HAS CONSUMED ME,

13:00.447 --> 13:03.077
AND I'VE LOST TOUCH
OF WHO I REALLY AM.

13:03.116 --> 13:05.946
YOU KNOW, JUST SAYING
THAT I WANT TO SELL IT

13:05.986 --> 13:07.486
MAKES ME FEEL FREE.

OKAY, LET ME JUST
POINT THIS OUT TO YOU, OKAY?

OF WHO YOU ARE.

20:20.387 --> 20:23.017
I LOVE MY JOB,
I LOVE BEING BALD.

20:23.055 --> 20:25.355
I AM LIVING LIFE
TO ITS FULLEST,

20:25.392 --> 20:27.932
AND THEN I WAS SAD
BECAUSE I LOST A FRIEND

20:27.960 --> 20:30.300
WHO NEVER GOT A CHANCE
TO ENJOY LIFE.

20:30.330 --> 20:31.830
HE NEVER GOT A CHANCE

20:31.864 --> 20:33.604
TO FEEL THE LOVE
THAT I HAVE.

20:33.633 --> 20:37.643
OH, MICHAEL, WELCOME BACK.

20:37.670 --> 20:39.270
YOU KNOW WHAT?

20:39.306 --> 20:40.406
WHAT?

20:40.440 --> 20:41.940
YOU WERE RIGHT.

20:41.974 --> 20:43.584
I CAN'T SELL
THAT BUSINESS.

20:43.610 --> 20:45.380
THAT'S MY GIFT
TO MY FAMILY.

20:45.412 --> 20:47.312
I'M NEVER GOING TO
LET THAT GO.

20:47.347 --> 20:49.447
I'M REALLY HAPPY
TO HEAR THAT.

20:49.482 --> 20:51.852
I'M SORRY THAT I WAS ACTING
A LITTLE CRAZY.

20:51.884 --> 20:53.424
I WENT
A LITTLE OVERBOARD...

20:53.453 --> 20:54.293
IT'S OKAY.

20:54.321 --> 20:55.591
BUT I'M BACK.

20:55.622 --> 20:57.922
GREAT.
WHERE ARE THE KIDS AT?

20:57.957 --> 21:00.527
BABY, I THINK
THEY'RE A LITTLE HUGGED OUT.

21:00.560 --> 21:02.430
NO, NO,
I WANT MY MONEY BACK.

21:10.803 --> 21:12.913
NO, YOU LISTEN TO ME,
MICHAEL KYLE.

21:12.939 --> 21:15.609
I LOVE YOU
WITH ALL MY HEART.
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

21:15.642 --> 21:17.512
SHUT UP AND LET ME TALK.

21:17.544 --> 21:19.854
I LOVE YOU
WITH ALL MY HEART

21:19.879 --> 21:22.719
AND I KNOW
HOW MUCH TOM'S --

21:24.617 --> 21:25.787
IT'S HIM!

21:25.818 --> 21:27.748
GO AHEAD. GO ON.
I'M SORRY.
