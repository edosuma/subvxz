00:13.114 --> 00:14.474
Comrade Godeanu!

00:46.874 --> 00:48.714
Mr. Godeanu!

01:18.714 --> 01:21.714
COMRADE GODEANU MISSING

01:22.634 --> 01:27.274
Long live Comrades
Nicolae and Elena CeauÈ™escu!

01:27.434 --> 01:30.114
We have an urgent telegram
from Germany.

01:30.274 --> 01:32.674
Victor Godeanu is missing.

01:32.834 --> 01:34.394
What?

01:34.554 --> 01:39.234
Missing how?
The earth can't have swallowed him!

01:47.234 --> 01:49.874
He's vanished.

01:50.034 --> 01:52.674
How the hell did he do it? When?

01:52.834 --> 01:55.074
We can't find him since this morning.

01:55.874 --> 01:58.594
The Russians must have extracted him.
Investigate.

01:58.754 --> 02:00.194
I will.

03:32.754 --> 03:36.554
-Which base are we going to?
-We're not going to a base just yet.

03:36.714 --> 03:39.794
-Why not?
-Arrangements still need to be made.

03:41.314 --> 03:43.274
You know, paperwork.

03:44.594 --> 03:46.034
Where are you taking me?

03:47.314 --> 03:49.314
Somewhere safe.

03:56.514 --> 04:00.074
Front door's the only way in,
we'll be watching the whole time.

04:00.234 --> 04:02.314
The place is empty.

04:04.594 --> 04:07.994
Oh yes,
there's an old lady downstairs.

04:08.154 --> 04:11.154
She's deaf and hates Russians.

04:19.754 --> 04:22.714
Welcome to your home away from home.

04:25.714 --> 04:27.874
You got the run of the place.

04:31.834 --> 04:35.594
Living room, kitchen.

04:36.714 --> 04:38.354
John!

04:41.474 --> 04:43.714
Mr. Godeanu, this is John.

04:43.874 --> 04:46.434
Good evening, Mr. Godeanu.
How are you?

04:46.594 --> 04:49.674
-Have we met?
-I don't think so.

04:49.834 --> 04:53.274
John will show you around,
your bed is down the hall.

04:53.434 --> 04:58.234
-When does the debriefing begin?
-One step at a time.

04:58.394 --> 05:01.714
I'll be back in the morning,
you're in good hands.

05:01.874 --> 05:05.874
-Guarded by a 17-year-old?
-Twenty-seven.

05:06.034 --> 05:08.794
Men younger than me fought
in Vietnam, Sir.

05:08.954 --> 05:11.514
The Cold War is another kind
of beast.

05:12.754 --> 05:15.514
Hey, I'm not far away.
You'll be okay.

05:16.674 --> 05:21.074
It's the first step to your freedom.
Have faith.

05:23.754 --> 05:25.194
Goodnight.

05:31.554 --> 05:33.754
Thanks for helping me on this.

05:37.394 --> 05:38.954
Take this.

05:39.114 --> 05:42.594
If it goes south,
tell everyone I forced you.

05:42.754 --> 05:44.394
Have a good night.

05:51.074 --> 05:53.954
Babe, I'm sorry.
I'll make it up to you.

05:54.114 --> 05:56.674
Just don't promise me anything.

05:56.834 --> 06:02.074
Tell me how to fix this and I will.
I'll call Eliza.

06:02.234 --> 06:06.474
No need to, I am well-versed
in lying to my friends for you.

06:08.674 --> 06:10.474
Delilah.

06:10.634 --> 06:13.994
Please, you have to trust me,
something big is going on.

06:14.154 --> 06:17.834
This thing can make my career,
our future.

06:17.994 --> 06:19.394
What future, Frank?

06:19.554 --> 06:23.034
The last big thing that got you
this obsessed landed us here.

06:23.194 --> 06:25.954
If you keep this up,
we have no future.

06:28.314 --> 06:31.194
I brought you some Red Sox pajamas.

06:31.354 --> 06:34.354
Sorry, they're the only ones I got.

06:35.634 --> 06:39.194
There's a blue toothbrush for you
in the bathroom.

06:39.354 --> 06:42.754
Ask me if you need anything, okay?

07:07.554 --> 07:10.394
-Hey, Scott.
-Frank!

07:11.874 --> 07:14.754
We got a meeting with the President.

07:15.754 --> 07:18.594
So I'll find an answer on my desk
tomorrow morning?

07:18.754 --> 07:22.314
-If everything goes well, yeah.
-Scott, every minute counts.

07:22.474 --> 07:24.474
I'll try to get him here.

07:24.634 --> 07:26.674
I have to go.

07:28.634 --> 07:33.514
Try? God damn it, just do it!

07:33.674 --> 07:38.514
Hey. Scott's the only one
who's stood by you.

07:38.674 --> 07:40.674
Give him a chance to do things right.

07:40.834 --> 07:45.994
I know. You're right.
I need to be patient.

07:50.434 --> 07:52.314
Am I forgiven?

07:52.474 --> 07:57.194
Keep your wits about you,
Mr. Jackson, and I'll think about it.

08:04.674 --> 08:09.034
You didn't go for the pajamas, huh?
Breakfast?

08:10.154 --> 08:13.634
I thought we'd be on our way
to the military base by now.

08:13.794 --> 08:16.634
I'm waiting to clear up some details
with Langley.

08:16.794 --> 08:19.874
-Details? What details?
-Papers.

08:20.874 --> 08:23.594
-Yeah.
-Bureaucracy will be the death of us.

08:26.394 --> 08:30.794
I don't get it. If Carter gave
his okay, the rest should be easy.

08:37.594 --> 08:41.114
Carter did give his okay, didn't he?

08:43.714 --> 08:45.354
Yes, he did.

08:45.514 --> 08:48.074
It's just the nuts and bolts
of CIA paperwork.

08:48.234 --> 08:51.114
Have a little patience, Victor.

08:51.274 --> 08:52.954
Frank, listen to me.

08:53.114 --> 08:56.554
In one hour, the Romanians will be
banging on my hotel room door.

08:56.714 --> 08:58.554
In four, the Romanian Intelligence

08:58.714 --> 09:01.074
and the German police
will be looking for me.

09:01.234 --> 09:02.874
We are not safe here.

09:08.314 --> 09:13.674
POLICE

09:13.834 --> 09:16.394
Here's the thing,
Commissioner Steinbruch.

09:16.554 --> 09:18.794
We need you
to treat this investigation

09:18.954 --> 09:20.434
with absolute discretion,

09:20.594 --> 09:23.514
given Comrade Godeanu's high rank.

09:23.674 --> 09:26.394
Of course. I was informed about it.

09:26.554 --> 09:29.234
I need your help
with all the information you have.

09:29.394 --> 09:30.914
Sure.

09:31.074 --> 09:33.274
-Where did you see him last?
-Here.

09:33.434 --> 09:35.714
We brought him to the hotel
around 3 p.m.

09:35.874 --> 09:38.354
This morning we were supposed
to pick him up

09:38.514 --> 09:40.154
for our flight to Bucharest.

09:40.314 --> 09:43.234
He was gone. We searched everywhere.

09:43.394 --> 09:47.714
-What was Godeanu doing in Germany?
-Meetings with government officials.

09:47.874 --> 09:49.874
What about unofficial meetings?

09:50.914 --> 09:53.714
Not that we know of.

09:53.874 --> 09:56.954
Mr. Godeanu has only been missing
a few hours.

09:57.114 --> 10:01.674
What if he had a rough night
and ended up in some woman's bed?

10:03.194 --> 10:07.034
Mr. Steinbruch,
we don't think that's the case.

10:07.194 --> 10:09.514
Comrade Godeanu is a responsible man

10:09.674 --> 10:12.354
and he's got a family at home
waiting for him.

10:18.154 --> 10:20.994
Mum, will you get that?

10:27.514 --> 10:29.474
Of course, you won't.

10:34.234 --> 10:35.914
-Hello.
-Felix, hi.

10:36.074 --> 10:38.554
Comrade Godeanu,
I have to tell you something.

10:38.714 --> 10:40.554
Come in.

10:42.034 --> 10:44.274
-What is it?
-Victor's gone missing.

10:44.434 --> 10:47.994
-How?
-He's missing. They can't find him.

10:49.594 --> 10:51.634
Maybe he's drunk
in some woman's bed.

10:51.794 --> 10:53.394
Mum!

10:53.554 --> 10:55.554
They searched everywhere.

10:55.714 --> 10:59.994
Maybe it was something urgent
and he was in a big hurry.

11:01.034 --> 11:05.914
You look tired. You should rest.

11:11.074 --> 11:14.514
-Better?
-A lot better.

11:14.674 --> 11:17.554
I'll rest on the weekend.

11:17.714 --> 11:21.474
Tonight I have to work on
the negotiations with the Romanians.

11:23.274 --> 11:25.234
Max, go play, you've had enough.

11:25.394 --> 11:27.874
-He hasn't finished.
-It's enough.

11:29.034 --> 11:30.474
Whatever you say.

11:32.154 --> 11:37.794
We should take a long holiday,
just the two of us.

11:37.954 --> 11:42.274
-After Max's school trip.
-Let's talk about it afterwards.

11:42.434 --> 11:44.514
It would be good for us all.

11:44.674 --> 11:49.114
We have to spend more time together,
as a family.

11:49.274 --> 11:52.154
Klaus can't have you all for himself.

11:52.314 --> 11:58.074
-Let's talk about it later.
-"Later"! Is that all you can say?

12:04.314 --> 12:05.834
All good?

12:07.314 --> 12:09.794
Should I bring a big glass
of whiskey?

12:10.634 --> 12:14.234
Yes. Thank you, Safiya.

12:24.194 --> 12:29.794
-Achmed! Play nice, you hear?
-I am, Mum!

12:29.954 --> 12:31.674
Good.

12:40.274 --> 12:44.034
-Love, give me the shopping.
-If you came to help, it's too late.

12:44.194 --> 12:46.594
-Give it here. What's that?
-Stop that.

12:51.194 --> 12:55.874
Nasir must have put it in by mistake.
I have to go return it.

12:56.034 --> 12:59.474
-No, it's for me.
-Let me go return it!

12:59.634 --> 13:01.194
-No need.
-We're not thieves.

13:01.354 --> 13:03.834
No, it's a gift.

13:03.994 --> 13:07.594
-Nasir didn't mention any gift.
-He must've forgotten.

13:07.754 --> 13:11.034
Oh, really?
At least use it to clean up!

13:38.714 --> 13:43.474
-All good?
-Of course. Just cleaning up a bit.

13:43.634 --> 13:47.234
I forgot to tell you,
your brother is coming to visit.

14:01.594 --> 14:03.634
Coffee is much better here.

14:03.794 --> 14:07.154
But I'm sure you'll love America
for many other things.

14:07.314 --> 14:12.314
-Washington is great, you'll--
-Love it, yeah. You said that.

14:15.314 --> 14:17.794
They got you right out of college,
didn't they?

14:17.954 --> 14:19.274
Yes.

14:19.434 --> 14:22.194
-Princeton?
-Stanford.

14:22.354 --> 14:25.634
Still, they don't send a novice
into a wolf's den

14:25.794 --> 14:28.594
unless he has a high-up uncle
at Langley.

14:28.754 --> 14:33.354
Or scores off the charts
at something. So which one is it?

14:33.514 --> 14:37.794
I'm fluent in German.
And scored high on all tests.

14:37.954 --> 14:41.754
And did well on one of our projects,
emerging weapons technologies.

14:41.914 --> 14:44.514
You're good with technology,
but not with people.

14:44.674 --> 14:47.794
Actually, I like to think of myself
as a people person.

14:47.954 --> 14:50.834
And I know a lot about the Cold War.

14:50.994 --> 14:55.514
Sure you do. On paper.

14:55.674 --> 15:00.354
Let me ask you, top-scorer John.
Do you know why you're here?

15:00.514 --> 15:03.114
I'm not sure
I understand the question.

15:03.274 --> 15:05.394
Let me rephrase that for you.

15:05.554 --> 15:10.874
Do you know why Frank put you here,
in this so-called safe house?

15:11.034 --> 15:12.874
I didn't think so.

15:14.754 --> 15:16.234
Call him.

15:20.354 --> 15:21.674
This is Frank.

15:21.834 --> 15:25.514
Our friend is getting a bit antsy
with this whole situation.

15:25.674 --> 15:29.274
-He wants to talk to you, now.
-I'll be right there.

15:31.394 --> 15:34.394
Godeanu didn't make his flight
this morning.

15:34.554 --> 15:38.714
Romanians think he's gone missing.
Got the police looking for him.

15:38.874 --> 15:43.114
Maybe he's in hiding.
Until he hears from us.

15:43.274 --> 15:46.074
Let's work it out. My office.

15:54.954 --> 15:58.594
The room service woman delivered
a bottle of wine next door

15:58.754 --> 16:01.594
and she spotted a blonde
leaving Victor's room.

16:01.754 --> 16:04.154
Did she describe the blonde?

16:04.314 --> 16:06.634
Just tall, high heels, very pretty,

16:06.794 --> 16:10.714
she had a very nice scarf,
with a colorful alligator pattern.

16:10.874 --> 16:13.074
Ms. von Weizendorff
had one like that.

16:13.234 --> 16:14.674
Who is Ms von Weizendorff?

16:14.834 --> 16:16.914
She's with the Ministry
of the Interior.

16:17.074 --> 16:21.754
The German ministry?
I have to call my superiors.

16:24.514 --> 16:27.154
Where's your head at, Sorin?

16:27.314 --> 16:30.514
Never tell more than
what is absolutely necessary.

16:31.194 --> 16:34.514
Make yourself useful,
get me von Weizendorff's file.

16:42.354 --> 16:43.994
Ms. von Weizendorff.

16:45.434 --> 16:48.194
He is Commissioner Steinbruch.

16:48.354 --> 16:51.514
He'd like to ask you a few questions
about Mr. Godeanu.

16:51.674 --> 16:52.994
-Hello.
-Hello.

16:53.154 --> 16:56.154
He appears to have gone missing.

16:56.314 --> 17:02.634
-Victor is missing? Do you know more?
-We know nothing.

17:02.794 --> 17:05.034
Will you take a seat?

17:05.194 --> 17:07.914
-A glass of water?
-No.

17:09.834 --> 17:13.474
Ms. von Weizendorff,
how well do you know Godeanu?

17:14.754 --> 17:16.074
Only professionally.

17:16.234 --> 17:21.714
We met to discuss a program
between our respective governments.

17:21.874 --> 17:26.274
Have you met Godeanu
anywhere other than the Ministry?

17:26.434 --> 17:28.354
No.

17:28.514 --> 17:30.394
Not in his hotel room?

17:32.514 --> 17:36.674
-I've just answered your question.
-Have you?

17:37.834 --> 17:39.314
I believe we are done here.

17:44.474 --> 17:45.794
Here is my number.

17:47.674 --> 17:50.034
In case the story changes.

17:55.074 --> 17:58.954
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

18:11.954 --> 18:17.514
Here are all our records of Godeanu's
last eight visits to Germany.

18:17.674 --> 18:21.314
Official reasons for coming,
places he was staying at,

18:21.474 --> 18:23.754
names he was traveling under.

18:23.914 --> 18:28.114
Maybe there's a clue
to his whereabouts buried in this.

18:28.274 --> 18:30.114
I doubt we'll be able to find him.

18:30.274 --> 18:32.634
I'm sure he'll contact us
sooner or later.

18:32.794 --> 18:35.234
That doesn't mean we stop looking.

19:04.594 --> 19:10.034
My car needs an oil change.
It's urgent. Today, 3 p.m.

19:11.314 --> 19:12.674
Thank you.

20:12.594 --> 20:14.514
What is so urgent?

20:16.594 --> 20:21.794
Godeanu's gone missing.
The police came asking questions.

20:21.954 --> 20:24.154
Do you know what happened to him?

20:25.434 --> 20:28.394
-No.
-Good.

20:29.474 --> 20:34.674
Next time they come, stay calm.
And don't lie.

20:36.234 --> 20:38.914
Just tell them what you know
about him.

20:45.074 --> 20:47.594
I slept with him at his hotel.

20:52.794 --> 20:58.914
I told you to convince him.
Not to screw him!

20:59.074 --> 21:01.474
If this goes wrong, I'm out.

21:05.554 --> 21:08.594
We've invested a whole lot in you.

21:08.754 --> 21:12.114
You stay in. Have a nice day.

21:50.874 --> 21:57.194
Hi, Victor, sorry I'm late.
John said you had some concerns.

21:58.194 --> 22:00.434
You lied to me.

22:00.594 --> 22:04.154
I'm sorry. Things didn't go
as I expected.

22:04.314 --> 22:07.754
This isn't a CIA operation,
it's just you and John hiding me!

22:07.914 --> 22:10.434
We don't have Carter's okay just yet.

22:10.594 --> 22:14.434
He's so worried Camp David would fail
that he doesn't want any problem.

22:14.594 --> 22:17.514
Problem? I'd have thought
the highest-ranking official

22:17.674 --> 22:20.714
from the Eastern Bloc is an asset
to the CIA.

22:20.874 --> 22:25.114
Look, this is just temporary.
I understand your disappointment.

22:25.274 --> 22:27.394
Disappointment? I'm risking my life!

22:27.554 --> 22:29.954
I put my career on the line for you.

22:30.114 --> 22:34.194
The difference between us is that,
while you are an overzealous officer,

22:34.354 --> 22:37.754
I'm a candidate
for the Court Martial!

22:37.914 --> 22:42.274
I know you cannot believe me,
I'm sure everything will go well.

22:43.674 --> 22:47.314
When? You think we're safe here?
That's what you think.

22:47.474 --> 22:50.914
-Yes, until--
-Until a bullet finds my head!

22:52.114 --> 22:56.434
I told you I only got us a few hours
until they realize I disappeared.

22:56.594 --> 22:57.994
That window is gone now.

22:58.154 --> 23:01.474
The Romanian Counterintelligence
is after me as we speak!

23:01.634 --> 23:04.194
The agent that followed me
into the car store

23:04.354 --> 23:06.274
is looking for me,
she will not stop!

23:06.434 --> 23:10.034
Victor, I know it doesn't look
like it, but this place is safe.

23:10.194 --> 23:11.834
Safe?

23:11.994 --> 23:14.554
The east window is facing
a five-floor building

23:14.714 --> 23:16.474
with plenty of spots for snipers.

23:16.634 --> 23:20.634
The west side is overlooking
a warehouse, another sniper's heaven!

23:20.794 --> 23:22.954
The north is across a shop
with windows

23:23.114 --> 23:24.554
that make us sitting ducks.

23:24.714 --> 23:28.114
And the fire ladder might as well
be a welcome mat.

23:40.994 --> 23:43.274
You're gonna want to hear this.

23:45.714 --> 23:49.514
...a Romanian diplomat
has been missing since last night.

23:49.674 --> 23:52.394
Victor Godeanu,
here on official business,

23:52.554 --> 23:55.154
was not in his hotel room
this morning.

23:55.314 --> 23:59.554
The search continues,
but so far the police have no leads.

23:59.714 --> 24:03.234
Godeanu is a high-ranking general
in CeauÈ™escu's Communist regime,

24:03.394 --> 24:07.194
and a valued member
of the President's inner circle.

24:07.354 --> 24:12.874
He was in Bonn for high-level talks
with the Ministry of the Interior.

24:13.034 --> 24:16.194
Since they're looking for me.
Let them find me.

24:16.354 --> 24:21.314
We interrupt your regular program
with breaking news

24:21.474 --> 24:23.914
on the missing Romanian diplomat.

24:24.074 --> 24:27.274
German police have been seen
on the banks of the Rhine

24:27.434 --> 24:31.594
where they cordoned off
a large search area.

24:31.754 --> 24:34.994
Now we learn more
about the object of their search.

24:35.154 --> 24:40.474
Shocking news has come to light
about the missing Romanian diplomat.

24:40.634 --> 24:45.474
It appears some of his belongings
might have been found in the Rhine.

24:45.634 --> 24:51.234
We have no details yet,
and the police refuse to comment.

25:05.474 --> 25:07.874
Stop! Stop!

25:12.514 --> 25:14.434
Commissioner.

25:15.514 --> 25:17.874
Is this the German version
of discretion?

25:18.034 --> 25:20.354
The whole world knows
Godeanu's missing.

25:20.514 --> 25:21.954
We have no control over it.

25:22.114 --> 25:25.794
This investigation was to be dealt
with the highest consideration.

25:25.954 --> 25:29.714
Can't you just deny
it's about Godeanu?

25:29.874 --> 25:33.354
We don't lie to our press,
Ms. Popescu.

25:54.794 --> 25:57.994
The German police are less
cooperative than we would like.

25:58.154 --> 26:00.874
The last reports suggest
a kidnapping.

26:01.034 --> 26:03.354
The photo may have been
a first attempt

26:03.514 --> 26:05.434
to stain Comrade Godeanu's name.

26:05.594 --> 26:08.234
Now, with this escalation,

26:08.394 --> 26:11.194
the enemy wants to destabilize
our regime.

26:11.354 --> 26:15.954
They left me
without my right-hand man.

26:17.234 --> 26:20.754
Curse those bastards!

26:23.074 --> 26:29.274
They want to weaken you.
But you know, and you won't let them.

26:29.434 --> 26:32.154
Whoever did this to Victor...

26:33.874 --> 26:36.034
I'll skin them alive.

26:38.794 --> 26:41.994
I'm sorry
I gave him those pearls back.

26:43.034 --> 26:45.554
They were ugly,
but I could have asked.

26:45.714 --> 26:48.114
Maybe he had something in mind.

26:52.234 --> 26:55.794
Comrade Nicolae CeauÈ™escu,
an urgent phone call.

27:04.514 --> 27:05.954
Hello.

27:11.834 --> 27:13.154
All right.

27:20.714 --> 27:24.674
They found his passport
on the bank of the Rhine.

27:26.754 --> 27:28.874
What's that supposed to mean?

27:30.914 --> 27:32.594
He's dead?

27:35.914 --> 27:38.194
He's not dead to me.

27:39.394 --> 27:41.714
Not until I see his body.

27:48.994 --> 27:50.474
Hello?

27:54.474 --> 27:55.914
What?

27:57.554 --> 28:02.114
-What happened?
-They're saying he might be dead.

28:09.394 --> 28:11.674
But I can feel he's alive.

28:12.714 --> 28:15.754
In the Godeanu case,
the police have broken off

28:15.914 --> 28:20.114
their hours-long search of the Rhine
for the day.

28:20.274 --> 28:22.074
Are you okay?

28:24.994 --> 28:28.594
Fuck, get that fucking towel!

28:39.594 --> 28:43.554
Last time I had one of these
happening I was a child.

28:46.554 --> 28:49.314
May-- Maybe it's the stress.

28:58.194 --> 29:00.114
Sir, you have a call.

29:05.794 --> 29:07.234
-Hello?
-Scott.

29:07.394 --> 29:09.914
Where were you?
I've been trying to reach you.

29:10.074 --> 29:13.914
Listen, Carter's not gonna sign off
on a missing guy.

29:14.074 --> 29:15.674
It's all over the news here.

29:17.834 --> 29:21.074
-I've got him.
-What do you mean you've got him?

29:21.234 --> 29:24.234
He's with me, but we need
to get him into US custody.

29:24.394 --> 29:25.794
Jesus Christ!

29:25.954 --> 29:29.114
Scott, all you have to do
is tell them I know where he is.

29:29.274 --> 29:30.954
That's lying, Frank.

29:31.114 --> 29:35.594
Listen, you know me. Trust me.
It's the right move.

29:35.754 --> 29:38.114
Career-making move.
Bonn is getting too hot.

29:42.554 --> 29:44.674
We need Carter's okay
to bring him in.

29:44.834 --> 29:47.994
You have until tomorrow morning,
then I'll do it regardless.

29:48.154 --> 29:49.474
No way, Frank.

29:52.514 --> 29:55.474
I'm staying here, John.
You can take the night off.

29:55.634 --> 29:56.954
Yeah?

30:00.514 --> 30:03.034
Come back with something
for Victor to wear,

30:03.194 --> 30:05.834
-something that suits him, not you.
-Sure.

30:05.994 --> 30:09.074
-You did well.
-I appreciate it, Frank.

30:09.234 --> 30:13.594
-No problem. Have a Good night.
-Thanks. You too.

30:17.034 --> 30:20.794
-What happened to you?
-Nosebleed.

30:21.994 --> 30:23.514
Come on.

30:32.754 --> 30:34.714
I got good news.

30:38.074 --> 30:40.074
You're getting picked up tomorrow.

30:48.914 --> 30:52.114
The high-level talks
continue at Camp David,

30:52.274 --> 30:55.714
after a first week of negotiations
with close to no results.

30:56.594 --> 30:59.874
Egyptian President Sadat
apparently met President Carter.

31:00.034 --> 31:02.474
-Thank you.
-Mother misses you.

31:02.634 --> 31:05.514
I miss her too.

31:06.994 --> 31:09.514
-How's work going?
-Good.

31:10.594 --> 31:15.834
Is that Ingrid treating you well?

31:15.994 --> 31:19.034
She treats me very well.
I like my job very much.

31:21.514 --> 31:26.674
I have to make a quick call.
I won't be long.

31:34.194 --> 31:37.314
You said the business was with Karim,
not Jabare.

31:37.474 --> 31:40.754
Jabare's joined us,
he has connections in Egypt.

31:40.914 --> 31:42.954
I know my brother, he's trouble.

31:44.034 --> 31:48.274
-Your problem is you don't trust me.
-It's him I don't trust.

31:48.434 --> 31:50.754
I know him better than you.

31:54.914 --> 31:58.114
-Thank you for letting me stay.
-Of course.

31:59.554 --> 32:01.634
I won't be in your hair too long.

32:10.834 --> 32:15.554
Max! What have we said?
No playing with your food!

32:15.714 --> 32:18.314
Finish your toast
or you'll be hungry at school.

32:18.474 --> 32:22.314
-You should eat something too.
-I'll eat later.

32:23.954 --> 32:26.114
Sit tight, I'll go.

32:33.434 --> 32:35.634
Do as your mother told you.

32:40.754 --> 32:44.954
Hello, Ms. von Weizendorff.
May I come in?

32:46.954 --> 32:49.354
-Of course.
-Thank you.

32:49.514 --> 32:50.994
Wait here, please.

33:00.114 --> 33:04.594
Gustav. Could you please take Max
to school? I have a visitor.

33:06.474 --> 33:08.514
Fine.

33:08.674 --> 33:13.834
-Hey, Max! Max! I'm being serious!
-Who is it?

33:14.994 --> 33:21.314
An old friend.
She has a problem and needs my help.

33:21.474 --> 33:23.514
You're always helping others.

33:24.994 --> 33:26.794
Let's go, Max!

33:28.354 --> 33:33.714
-Get your car.
-Here it is. Have fun at school!

33:35.714 --> 33:38.674
-Hello.
-Hello.

33:52.874 --> 33:54.434
Have a seat.

34:00.594 --> 34:05.394
-So what do you want?
-Victor.

34:06.594 --> 34:10.674
-I don't know where he is.
-How about...

34:13.034 --> 34:15.354
...who he's in league with?

34:17.514 --> 34:19.034
Do you know that?

34:19.194 --> 34:22.554
That is General Shakarov,
the head of the KGB.

34:22.714 --> 34:26.154
A lot of blood on his hands,
as I'm sure you're aware.

34:33.514 --> 34:37.714
Looks like you don't know
Victor very well at all.

34:37.874 --> 34:43.874
Despite the fact that you spent
the night in his room at the hotel.

34:44.034 --> 34:46.314
I know you're Stasi.

34:46.474 --> 34:49.074
I can blow up your life
before your boy makes it

34:49.234 --> 34:51.314
to his private kindergarten today.

34:51.474 --> 34:58.314
I don't know where you get
your information from, Ms. Popescu.

34:58.474 --> 35:01.274
But I assure you it's wrong.

35:01.434 --> 35:07.034
You met Victor in Frankfurt in '68.
You had an affair, you were in love.

35:07.194 --> 35:09.434
He wasn't.

35:09.594 --> 35:14.554
You were a source to him,
a pretty face.

35:15.874 --> 35:20.034
I have your file,
I have photos of you and Victor.

35:20.194 --> 35:25.274
I can arrange everyone
in your fake life gets a copy.

35:36.234 --> 35:38.834
And you would risk
the Pilgrims program?

35:38.994 --> 35:42.514
I only care about Victor.

36:14.914 --> 36:19.634
I saw Victor at the US Embassy.
Couple of days ago.

36:21.474 --> 36:25.034
-Are you sure it was him?
-Yes, of course.

36:25.194 --> 36:26.954
He was waiting in the lobby.

36:27.114 --> 36:29.554
He didn't have
an official appointment.

36:29.714 --> 36:32.234
He doesn't necessarily need one.

36:32.394 --> 36:36.154
Well, my instinct tells me
he didn't report the meeting.

36:37.594 --> 36:41.034
I think he defected to the Americans.

36:49.554 --> 36:52.314
Do you know who he was meeting there?

36:52.474 --> 36:56.874
An agent called Frank Jackson,
but I don't know anything about him.

36:57.034 --> 36:58.554
I need more.

37:01.194 --> 37:03.234
I know his right hand.

37:19.594 --> 37:21.674
His name is John Miller.

37:32.354 --> 37:34.954
And now get the fuck out of my house!

37:37.034 --> 37:38.594
Thank you.

38:17.594 --> 38:20.594
-Hello.
-He defected to The Americans.

38:20.754 --> 38:24.034
Impossible.
Carmen, you can't just say that.

38:24.194 --> 38:27.154
-You have to be sure.
-I know.

38:28.234 --> 38:30.834
I trust the source,
and if this is confirmed...

38:30.994 --> 38:33.554
What a mess!

38:34.674 --> 38:39.274
Something like this is unheard of.

38:39.434 --> 38:42.914
Do we stick to arresting him
or can I kill him?

38:44.194 --> 38:45.794
I'll get back to you.

39:28.674 --> 39:30.154
All right, thank you.

39:32.154 --> 39:34.794
I got a tip from an old lady.

39:34.954 --> 39:39.314
She says a man in her building
matches Godeanu's description!

39:41.674 --> 39:45.474
You three, with me.
Call the Chief Commissioner.

39:45.634 --> 39:49.554
So, I got you this.

39:51.554 --> 39:55.234
What do you think?
You're gonna look hot in that.

39:55.394 --> 39:57.874
I need to blend in
it's not a fashion parade.

39:58.034 --> 40:01.194
Even if you blend in,
you're still gonna be hot.

40:01.354 --> 40:04.314
Also, I got you these.

40:04.474 --> 40:07.114
-Pretty neat, huh?
-Yeah.

40:09.514 --> 40:11.034
What?

40:34.994 --> 40:39.794
I knew I'd seen your face before!
Ingrid von Weizendorff.

40:39.954 --> 40:42.154
She saw me at the embassy.
She's Stasi!

40:42.314 --> 40:46.114
-Fuck. Do you know this woman?
-Yeah, we met at a party.

41:01.354 --> 41:04.834
We slept together once, she thinks
I work in Cultural Outreach.

41:04.994 --> 41:07.874
-You know what she thinks?
-You should have told me.

41:08.034 --> 41:10.514
Don't tell me she knows
where you live.

41:25.074 --> 41:27.754
I wasn't thinking.
I messed up, I know.

41:27.914 --> 41:31.914
Ms. Popescu! What are you doing here?

41:33.914 --> 41:37.794
There are at least two voices inside,
speaking English.

41:37.954 --> 41:41.514
-Did anyone follow you this morning?
-No. I don't think so.

41:41.674 --> 41:45.474
You don't think so!
If we don't leave now, I'm dead!

41:46.834 --> 41:48.994
German police, open up!

41:52.514 --> 41:53.834
Can I help you?

41:53.994 --> 41:56.154
-We are looking for a man--
-A fugitive.

41:56.314 --> 42:00.354
He disappeared a few days ago,
we've got a tip he might be here.

42:00.514 --> 42:01.874
Well, he's not.

42:04.314 --> 42:07.034
Do you have a warrant, Madam?

42:08.354 --> 42:11.554
-Excuse me?
-Ms. Popescu, let's take a minute!

42:14.354 --> 42:16.754
I can't let you search
without a warrant.

42:16.914 --> 42:20.034
-Can you tell her? Please.
-Ms. Popescu.

42:21.274 --> 42:23.314
Please.

42:25.154 --> 42:27.954
-Ms. Popescu!
-Madam?

42:28.114 --> 42:32.754
Ms. Popescu, this is highly unusual.
Please, you are out of bounds.

42:32.914 --> 42:38.194
-May I ask who you're looking for?
-Of course, her colleague.

42:38.354 --> 42:41.394
I understand,
but this is my property.

42:41.554 --> 42:44.714
Without a warrant,
you are all trespassing.

42:44.874 --> 42:49.314
I apologize for the intrusion,
I gather it's personal for her.

42:52.354 --> 42:54.794
You work for the American Embassy,
don't you?
