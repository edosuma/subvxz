16:23.901 --> 16:25.318
[both chuckle]

16:28.029 --> 16:30.198
Speaking of which,
where are you at with the whole

16:30.281 --> 16:32.450
get married, get pregnant,
start a family thing?

16:32.617 --> 16:34.745
Is my mother paying you
to have this conversation?

16:34.912 --> 16:36.580
- She should be.
- Yeah. I know.

16:36.788 --> 16:38.623
It's kind of hard to have kids
if you don't have a man.

16:38.832 --> 16:41.167
Clearly my boyfriend
has abandoned me. So... Oh!

16:42.293 --> 16:44.588
- Hey. We were just talking about you.
- Yeah?

16:44.796 --> 16:46.130
[Meg]
I missed you.

16:47.215 --> 16:48.466
[Meg laughing]

16:48.675 --> 16:49.968
All right. Cool it.

16:50.176 --> 16:52.721
Keep it in your pants, you two.

16:59.018 --> 17:00.687
[Danny]
Hey, Mr. Mister,

17:01.145 --> 17:04.733
can we squeeze in
an extra chair at the main table?

17:05.233 --> 17:07.193
- Oh, no, I have a chair for you.
- No. No.

17:07.527 --> 17:11.072
It's not for me. I've invited someone.

17:11.865 --> 17:14.117
- Someone, like a date? Oh.
- Yeah.

17:14.325 --> 17:16.077
Exactly like a date.

17:16.286 --> 17:17.829
Nobody told me
you were bringing anyone.

17:18.037 --> 17:20.791
Well. I'm telling you now.

17:22.542 --> 17:23.961
Thanks.

17:25.378 --> 17:27.589
- What?
- What do you think that's about?

17:27.798 --> 17:29.841
[band playing jazz music]

17:32.385 --> 17:34.012
- Kev. Kevin.
- I'll be right back.

17:34.178 --> 17:35.889
I'll be right back.

17:41.019 --> 17:43.354
- Extra chair, not a problem?
- Not a problem.

17:43.563 --> 17:45.273
- I appreciate it.
- No big deal.

17:45.482 --> 17:46.817
[Kevin]
What's no big deal?

17:47.400 --> 17:49.486
Nothing. Everything is fine.

17:49.694 --> 17:51.321
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

17:51.529 --> 17:52.864
[all applauding]

17:58.036 --> 18:00.079
[band playing upbeat Caribbean music]

18:00.288 --> 18:02.457
- Who's this girl?
- What difference does it make?

18:02.540 --> 18:05.460
Well, Mom and Dad haven't met her.
None of us have met her.

18:05.627 --> 18:07.629
You want her to sit at the family table?

18:07.838 --> 18:10.131
Well, hold on. Hold on.

18:10.340 --> 18:13.092
- Your wife's sitting at the table.
- We're married, dude.

18:13.301 --> 18:14.970
- John's wife's sitting at the table.
- That's different.

18:15.053 --> 18:18.139
That's family. Literally.

18:18.348 --> 18:21.726
- What about Meg's boyfriend?
- Marco? His name is Marco.

18:21.935 --> 18:23.645
The guy that she's engaged to?

18:23.812 --> 18:26.857
- We are not really engaged.
- You've been together for five years.

18:27.024 --> 18:29.359
I'm not gonna make her sit on her own.
She doesn't know anyone.

18:29.567 --> 18:31.194
That's the point, Danny.

18:31.653 --> 18:32.696
What's the problem?

18:32.904 --> 18:34.197
Danny brought a date.

18:34.405 --> 18:37.075
Yeah, it's a big crisis.
Glad you're here to sort it out.

18:37.283 --> 18:39.995
He wants her to sit at the family table.

18:40.078 --> 18:42.706
You know how Mom and Dad are
about these things. She's not family.

18:42.789 --> 18:44.916
Well, I'm confused because I'm family.

18:45.124 --> 18:46.292
She's here with me.

18:46.501 --> 18:48.419
Don't act like you don't know
what you're doing.

18:48.628 --> 18:50.380
You know exactly
what you're fucking doing.

18:50.588 --> 18:52.716
- What am I doing?
- You're so full of shit.

18:52.924 --> 18:54.342
[Meg]
People can hear you.

18:56.260 --> 18:58.763
Help us out here. Who is she?

18:58.972 --> 19:03.142
Her name's Sheryl.
So I guess she's Sheryl.

19:03.351 --> 19:06.813
Sheryl's gonna make everyone at the table
feel a little uncomfortable.

19:06.897 --> 19:08.398
But you know that, right?

19:08.606 --> 19:11.568
- You know that. You like that.
- Don't do this.

19:11.776 --> 19:13.028
Is that true, really?

19:13.236 --> 19:15.655
- I think you get off on this shit.
- You need to calm down.

19:15.864 --> 19:18.533
He gets off on this shit.
Someone's gotta call him on it.

19:18.742 --> 19:22.079
Is this gonna make you
feel uncomfortable? Is it?

19:22.412 --> 19:26.833
You know what we're doing?
We're thinking about Mom and Dad.

19:27.125 --> 19:29.168
Okay. Meg, you?

19:29.377 --> 19:33.214
I don't care. I just want everybody
to chill out. People can hear us.

19:33.423 --> 19:36.175
The only one here
that's all worked up is you.

19:36.342 --> 19:39.763
- I'm gonna go tell Gwen to add a chair.
- No. We're not giving in to him.

19:39.971 --> 19:43.474
We're not giving in to him. This isn't
gonna be the fucking Danny show.

19:43.683 --> 19:46.103
I'm not gonna do it this time, Dan.

19:47.020 --> 19:51.566
Okay. Fine. Okay?
Sheryl will sit somewhere else.

19:51.775 --> 19:54.193
- I'll go sit with Sheryl.
- [Kevin] All right. Very good.

19:54.402 --> 19:56.571
- No.
- [Danny] Yeah. I'll sit with Sheryl.

19:56.780 --> 19:59.657
No. You're not gonna do that.
That's gonna upset Mom.

19:59.866 --> 20:02.035
If you're not sitting at the family table,
that upsets Mom.

20:02.243 --> 20:05.371
It's the fucking family table. Why is this
so difficult for you to understand?

20:05.580 --> 20:08.625
[Danny] You think I'm gonna fucking invite
a date and not sit with her?

20:08.833 --> 20:10.877
You shouldn't have invited the date.

20:11.086 --> 20:12.129
Shut the fuck up.

20:12.336 --> 20:15.214
If that's gonna be a problem with Mom,
that's on your head.

20:15.423 --> 20:17.050
Just walk away. Just walk away.

20:17.258 --> 20:20.011
It wasn't a problem
until you fucking made it one.

20:36.402 --> 20:37.445
All right.

20:37.654 --> 20:39.363
[Robert speaks indistinctly]

20:39.447 --> 20:40.865
[Robert laughs]

20:44.202 --> 20:47.080
[Robert] Forty-five years ago--
It's hard to believe.

20:47.288 --> 20:50.834
Forty-five years ago this weekend,
me and my Sally,

20:51.042 --> 20:53.503
we opened the doors to this place.

20:54.004 --> 20:56.339
[all cheering]

20:56.589 --> 20:57.715
Thanks.

21:00.677 --> 21:02.470
Ah, y'all got such a great family.

21:02.679 --> 21:07.142
Um, Sally was pregnant, of course.
And I was a little bit nervous.

21:07.350 --> 21:09.352
I was scared shitless, actually.

21:09.560 --> 21:10.687
[all laughing]

21:11.354 --> 21:12.814
Your daddy's funny.

21:14.107 --> 21:15.608
[Sheryl laughing]

21:15.817 --> 21:21.198
I mean, what did I know about raising
babies or running a hotel or anything?

21:21.405 --> 21:25.160
When you meet a woman like Sally...

21:25.869 --> 21:27.578
[both laughing]

21:29.247 --> 21:32.375
She makes you strong.
She makes you brave.

21:33.001 --> 21:35.795
She makes you believe
that anything is possible.

21:36.004 --> 21:41.467
And looking around here tonight
at all these people, and my family,

21:41.676 --> 21:45.013
and everything,
I realize that she was on the right track.

21:45.471 --> 21:47.098
Stand up.

21:47.306 --> 21:48.725
[all cheering]

21:48.933 --> 21:50.227
[Kevin]
I love you, Mom.

22:00.570 --> 22:03.447
Now, in case you haven't heard,
there's a pier

22:03.656 --> 22:06.784
being dedicated to us,
the Rayburn family here,

22:07.744 --> 22:10.538
in a few days off the coast highway.

22:10.747 --> 22:16.794
Just a couple of planks, but I'm glad
you're all here to help us celebrate that.

22:16.920 --> 22:18.588
[scattered applause]

22:23.384 --> 22:28.347
There's something else I wanna say,
and I'm not quite sure how to say it.

22:28.639 --> 22:30.349
Um...

22:32.185 --> 22:34.104
Many years ago,
we had us some trouble.

22:37.398 --> 22:42.445
I recognize some of the people here
who helped us through that.

22:44.030 --> 22:46.241
I probably should have
thanked you back then.

22:46.449 --> 22:48.701
But I didn't,
and I'd like to thank you tonight.

22:52.247 --> 22:56.751
Before I sit down, I'd like to say
a few words about my kids.

22:57.294 --> 22:58.377
[chuckles]

22:58.461 --> 23:02.340
Um, there's Meg,
my sunshine, who went north

23:02.548 --> 23:06.385
to Tallahassee to study law
up in Yankee country.

23:06.594 --> 23:08.012
[all chuckle]

23:08.346 --> 23:14.102
And then there's Kevin, my youngest son,
whose love of the sea and life,

23:14.311 --> 23:18.439
and the 3:00 cocktail... kept him here.

23:18.648 --> 23:19.983
Woo-hoo! Thank you.

23:20.191 --> 23:22.110
And of course there's John,

23:22.319 --> 23:24.528
who likes taking care of people
so much that he decided

23:24.612 --> 23:27.031
to take care of the whole bunch of us,
not just the family,

23:27.198 --> 23:29.867
the whole damn island.

23:31.119 --> 23:33.579
And then-- Oh, yeah.

23:33.913 --> 23:37.083
Last but not least is my oldest...

23:38.501 --> 23:39.836
Mmm...

23:40.419 --> 23:42.213
Uh, Danny.

23:42.713 --> 23:44.924
The one who got away, you might say.

23:46.092 --> 23:49.095
But he always finds
a reason to come back.

23:52.682 --> 23:54.392
Even if it is to ask for money.

23:54.809 --> 23:56.019
[laughs]

23:59.356 --> 24:01.858
I'm only kidding.

24:02.566 --> 24:04.485
Weekend wouldn't be the same
without you.

24:04.694 --> 24:06.487
I wouldn't miss it, Dad.

24:07.571 --> 24:10.908
I think I'll sit down
and shut up now. Thank you.

24:11.909 --> 24:13.494
[Kevin]
Well done, Dad.

24:20.584 --> 24:22.003
Um...

24:22.420 --> 24:24.005
I'd like to say a couple of words.

24:24.172 --> 24:27.258
- Just a couple of words if I may, Dad.
- [Robert] Sure. Sure.

24:30.178 --> 24:31.512
Here you go.

24:40.563 --> 24:41.981
[Danny]
Uh...

24:49.113 --> 24:51.074
Can I borrow a 20?

24:51.532 --> 24:52.700
Just a 20.

- You just took the whole bottle, did you?

25:14.889 --> 25:18.142
Boy, you've got a lot of energy.

25:18.351 --> 25:19.518
Oh, my gosh.

25:20.186 --> 25:23.273
- Holy cow. Whoo!
- Yeah, just like that.

25:23.481 --> 25:27.944
[Kevin] Hey, babe. She started it.
She started it. She started it!

25:36.577 --> 25:39.163
Looks like your friend's
enjoying herself.

25:39.372 --> 25:42.917
Yeah. She could be the one.

25:46.670 --> 25:48.506
[Kevin]
Come on.

25:50.716 --> 25:52.427
- You okay?
- Yeah. Thanks.

25:52.635 --> 25:54.762
About time she went home, huh?

25:55.721 --> 25:58.891
You haven't had a chance
to dance with her yet.

25:59.892 --> 26:01.644
I don't dance with other women.

26:04.730 --> 26:06.690
Still kayaking, Dad?

26:06.899 --> 26:09.402
- [Robert] Every day.
- Oh, yeah?

26:09.610 --> 26:11.904
How's your time these days?

26:13.072 --> 26:14.824
I don't miss a stroke.

26:15.325 --> 26:17.535
Glad to hear it.

26:17.618 --> 26:18.869
[laughing]

26:18.953 --> 26:21.080
You look good, Dad.

26:26.544 --> 26:30.923
- How you doing? You all right?
- Yeah. Nothing I can't handle.

26:31.132 --> 26:33.301
You go enjoy your family.

Wow. Takes after his dad.

You know.

- Night.

broken in this damn house.

- What's that?
- Blood pressure medication.

You got high blood pressure?

I'm managing it.

stranded at the bus stop like that.

28:19.949 --> 28:21.325
Don't worry about it.

I got off at Key Largo, I was gonna
go see a buddy. I tried to call you.

- It's fine. Don't worry about it.
- It's flat.

I mean, it's flat. I need to borrow
a charger. Can I get a charger?

- Home.

- I miss it here.

You think it's a bad idea.

- Yeah.

We, you know,
start going at it, you know.

34:14.845 --> 34:18.140
- Mm-hm.
- And, um, she says...

34:18.348 --> 34:20.058
"Hit me."

34:21.602 --> 34:23.145
Like "hit her" hit her.

34:23.353 --> 34:25.773
Wanted me to hit her in the face.

34:25.982 --> 34:28.066
What? Why?

34:28.275 --> 34:31.111
I don't know. I told her
I don't do that kind of thing.

Well, good.

I mean, truth is, I didn't really know
if I wanted to fuck her or not.

34:41.497 --> 34:44.708
She says again, "Hit me."

34:44.917 --> 34:48.211
And I said no again.

34:48.963 --> 34:53.216
Then she whacks me with her fist.

34:53.425 --> 34:56.012
And I thought she broke my nose.

35:03.143 --> 35:08.732
I realized that she was doing it so,
you know, I'd get mad and I'd hit her.

35:24.206 --> 35:27.751
- [John] Fred, how are you?
- [Fred] I'm good, John.

35:28.335 --> 35:30.921
- [John] How long you been out here?
- Not too long.

No.

kicking me.

How could I? She came after me, right?
She's still screaming, carrying on.

36:07.290 --> 36:09.209
I pin her down to the ground
and I tell her,

36:09.292 --> 36:11.837
"You better calm the fuck down.
I will just leave."

What did she say?

36:17.801 --> 36:22.932
She tells me how no one loves her.
And how now I'm just gonna leave

36:23.140 --> 36:28.562

So now I feel bad for her.

- Yeah.

I ended up seeing her for a few months.

46:28.704 --> 46:30.872
I want Danny in my life.

46:32.081 --> 46:34.167
I want him to know my children.

46:38.296 --> 46:40.674
Goddamn it,
you don't give up on family.

46:42.342 --> 46:44.219
Do you want him to stay?

46:50.726 --> 46:52.060

46:56.773 --> 46:59.609
[woman] I was surprised
to see you get off that bus.

47:03.196 --> 47:05.407
You should take it easy
with those things.

47:05.532 --> 47:07.033
Why don't you try one?

47:07.158 --> 47:12.288
No. I don't need any.
I'm not in any pain.

47:19.128 --> 47:21.130
You gonna stay after the weekend?

47:21.339 --> 47:22.965
Maybe I should go with you.

47:24.718 --> 47:26.428
I don't think that's a good idea.

47:26.636 --> 47:30.515
Stay or go.
It's not even up to me anymore.

47:34.352 --> 47:36.062

No.

51:02.852 --> 51:06.355
Oh, man. I do. Heh.

51:07.315 --> 51:12.821
You hooked a tarpon. Fucking hooked
a tarpon. Thing was twice your size.

51:13.029 --> 51:18.994
But Dad... he wasn't gonna help you.
He wanted you to reel it in yourself.

51:19.201 --> 51:21.120
I don't remember.

51:21.830 --> 51:24.916
Okay. Oh, man.

51:26.334 --> 51:29.629
Oh, I fucked up last night.

51:31.047 --> 51:32.799
I can't even remember what happened.

51:35.969 --> 51:38.304
I know it's not, um...

51:40.723 --> 51:44.811

And I'm sure you, you know...

51:45.561 --> 51:48.439
- don't want me here.
- That's not true.

51:51.400 --> 51:53.778
That money I owe you,
I'm gonna pay it all back.

51:53.987 --> 51:56.906
I been keeping track of it.
I'm paying it back with interest.

52:05.081 --> 52:06.958
Dad gave me his answer.

52:09.544 --> 52:10.837
Oh...

52:11.796 --> 52:13.840
I'm sorry, man. It's not gonna work out.

52:13.923 --> 52:15.675
[Danny sighs]

52:17.343 --> 52:20.262
That's what he said?
He don't want me back?

52:20.471 --> 52:23.558
No, he didn't put it that way. He just--

52:26.102 --> 52:27.603
And what did you say?

52:27.812 --> 52:30.940
He's just not ready for it.
It's not a good time.

52:31.148 --> 52:34.193
No, is that what he thinks?
Or what you think?

52:36.863 --> 52:41.701
Don't do that. You asked me
to talk to him and I talked to him.

52:41.910 --> 52:43.870
Did you try to convince him?

52:45.413 --> 52:49.042
What do you want, huh?
What the fuck do you want?

52:49.208 --> 52:51.669
Do you need another loan?
You need somewhere to stay?

52:51.878 --> 52:53.254
Fuck you.

52:53.838 --> 52:55.631
How can I help you?

52:55.840 --> 52:58.009
Oh, yeah. You wanna help me.

52:58.217 --> 53:01.721
Like what? Like the way
you tried to convince Dad?

53:01.888 --> 53:06.601
Did everything in your power to get him
to change his fucking narrow mind

53:06.809 --> 53:09.062
and take me back?

53:12.023 --> 53:15.651
Or did you just sit there like
a good boy with your mouth shut?

53:16.861 --> 53:18.279
Like you always fucking do.

53:19.072 --> 53:21.866
I did what you asked me to do.

53:23.618 --> 53:28.289
Your life's not always gonna be
this perfect. Things happen to people.

53:32.710 --> 53:35.130
And then you'll need me.

53:36.047 --> 53:38.049
And then you'll know.

53:39.675 --> 53:42.178
What the fuck
am I gonna know, Danny?

53:42.386 --> 53:43.679
Huh?

53:43.888 --> 53:46.432
What the fuck
are you even talking about?

53:47.183 --> 53:48.935
Are you saying that I don't help you?

53:49.144 --> 53:52.313
Are you saying that my
whole life I haven't tried to help you?

53:52.897 --> 53:55.024
My whole fucking life,
that's what I've done.

53:55.232 --> 53:59.779
I've fucking tried to protect you.
I've tried to protect big brother.

54:05.701 --> 54:07.453
I'll leave tonight.

54:09.705 --> 54:11.124
Don't do that.

54:11.499 --> 54:15.711
The bonfire's tonight.
The pier dedication's in the morning.

54:28.599 --> 54:32.020

Knowing when to leave.

Are you asking me to stay?

Don't worry about it.

was being born a Rayburn.

57:08.343 --> 57:10.719
Now I'm not so sure.

57:21.480 --> 57:24.108
I'm gonna tell you everything.

57:26.735 --> 57:28.821
It's not very pleasant.

57:30.614 --> 57:32.658
