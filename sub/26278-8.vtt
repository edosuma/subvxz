00:46.143 --> 00:48.746
- Hurry up, John!
- I'm trying!

00:53.546 --> 00:56.946
Constables! What took you so long?

00:57.532 --> 00:59.950
We got here as quickly as we could.

00:59.966 --> 01:01.687
- You said there was a robbery?
- I think so.

01:01.697 --> 01:05.022
- You think so?
- There is an open window, a broken vase...

01:05.037 --> 01:06.319
- Nothing else?
- No.

01:06.336 --> 01:07.440
Well, where are the owners?

01:07.464 --> 01:10.947
We don't know. We called out
for them, but they didn't answer.

01:11.612 --> 01:14.860
- The mistress is usually up by now.
- Right. We best take a look.

01:15.292 --> 01:17.454
I've always wondered what this
house was like on the inside.

01:17.478 --> 01:19.916
- Why so?
- Well, this house belongs to Franklin Westerbrook.

01:20.041 --> 01:22.085
- The Carpet King?
- The one and only.

01:27.804 --> 01:29.883
- Any sign of them?
- Not upstairs.

01:30.394 --> 01:33.261
Well, look. Someone's been through here.

01:33.487 --> 01:34.756
Look at this...

01:35.212 --> 01:37.011
they've jimmied open the window.

01:41.199 --> 01:42.507
John...

01:43.257 --> 01:44.500
come with me.

01:44.527 --> 01:46.473
Ladies, please. Stay put.

01:59.710 --> 02:00.997
My goodness.

02:04.422 --> 02:06.020
Ladies, please.

02:16.313 --> 02:17.768
Carefully, now.

02:19.038 --> 02:20.716
Any first impressions, Miss Hart?

02:20.763 --> 02:22.084
They appear to have drowned.

02:22.101 --> 02:24.330
I won't know much more
until after a post-mortem.

02:24.455 --> 02:25.634
Very good.

02:26.648 --> 02:27.939
Who found them?

02:28.064 --> 02:30.747
- Constable Crabtree and I.
- I see.

02:30.872 --> 02:34.045
Sir? One of the maids found this inside.

02:34.347 --> 02:36.483
It seems to be a suicide note.

02:39.891 --> 02:42.290
"To our darling daughters, we are sorry.

02:42.311 --> 02:44.182
Your mother and I have become exhausted

02:44.195 --> 02:46.662
by our constant dissatisfaction,

02:46.787 --> 02:48.383
and can take no more."

02:48.508 --> 02:51.153
Signed by both Franklin
and Louise Westerbrook.

02:51.489 --> 02:53.224
A double suicide, then.

02:53.565 --> 02:56.300
Let's not jump to
conclusions too quickly.

03:02.262 --> 03:03.851
Did you notice anything...

03:03.976 --> 03:06.454
different about the
couple? I mean, any...

03:06.479 --> 03:09.969
- excess of melancholy?
- No, not at all.

03:10.327 --> 03:12.385
But then, you only started working

03:12.402 --> 03:13.856
a couple of weeks prior to today?

03:13.903 --> 03:17.971
Well, yes. I've heard that Mrs.
Westerbrook was a difficult woman,

03:17.997 --> 03:20.699
but I simply think
she had high standards.

03:20.899 --> 03:23.166
So, you enjoyed working for them?

03:23.291 --> 03:24.738
I did.

03:25.560 --> 03:27.712
Do you think anyone had
animosity towards them?

03:27.720 --> 03:30.183
Oh, I'm not one to know that.

03:30.308 --> 03:33.617
I do know that they were very
extravagant in their wealth.

03:33.987 --> 03:35.781
That must ruffle some feathers.

03:35.828 --> 03:38.612
So, you believe the burglar
might have known the Westerbrooks?

03:39.315 --> 03:41.377
Everyone knew that they had money.

03:41.879 --> 03:44.593
It certainly appears
something was taken.

03:46.195 --> 03:48.527
Hmm. We'll have to check this area

03:48.544 --> 03:50.257
and the butler's pantry for fingermarks.

03:50.286 --> 03:52.114
I've instructed the constables.

03:52.570 --> 03:55.464
Do you think this burglar
killed the Westerbrooks?

03:55.506 --> 03:57.407
Even if there was an altercation,

03:57.458 --> 04:00.031
wouldn't he simply kill them and flee?

04:00.095 --> 04:03.788
Why go all the way out to the
pool and stage a double suicide?

04:03.849 --> 04:06.081
Perhaps it truly was suicide.

04:06.132 --> 04:09.468
Unusual, but not completely
without precedent.

04:09.593 --> 04:13.234
- And this burglary was just an unlucky coincidence?
- Mm-hmm.

04:14.244 --> 04:16.676
Extremely unlucky if you ask me.

04:17.737 --> 04:19.450
What can you tell us?

04:19.575 --> 04:21.832
Mr. and Mrs. Franklin
and Louise Westerbrook

04:21.844 --> 04:23.804
were found deceased in
their home this morning.

04:23.830 --> 04:25.522
Now, that's all the information we have.

04:25.526 --> 04:27.328
Good day, gentlemen. Ladies.

04:27.976 --> 04:29.969
Inspector Brackenreid, a word?

04:29.970 --> 04:31.244
- Harvey Leech.
- Who?

04:31.316 --> 04:34.409
I'm a reporter with Toronto's
premiere society journal,

04:34.431 --> 04:35.551
the Toronto Tattle.

04:35.585 --> 04:38.292
One of the city's more high
minded periodicals, I take it.

04:38.417 --> 04:41.479
My source tells me the
Westerbrooks drowned themselves.

04:41.487 --> 04:43.328
- Was it a double suicide?
- Listen.

04:43.453 --> 04:45.322
- We have no further information...
- Or did one of them

04:45.334 --> 04:47.375
murder the other, and
then kill themselves?

04:47.500 --> 04:50.068
- My money's on Louise.
- That's enough!

04:50.193 --> 04:51.496
Now, get lost.

04:57.649 --> 04:59.626
Bloody reporter just ambushed me,

04:59.751 --> 05:02.898
wanting all the gory details.
He heard it was a suicide.

05:03.023 --> 05:04.269
How did he know that?

05:04.286 --> 05:06.490
- Said he had a "source."
- One of the maids?

05:06.528 --> 05:07.630
I don't care who it is, now

05:07.643 --> 05:09.403
we've got the press
breathing down our necks.

05:09.495 --> 05:12.403
All right. Detective Watts, you
chase down this burglar lead.

05:12.475 --> 05:16.165
The older maid, Sarah, told me a
considerable amount of silverware

05:16.191 --> 05:17.998
was stolen, all monogrammed.

05:18.027 --> 05:21.614
- I'll visit some pawn shops.
- Higgins! What's that?

05:22.138 --> 05:23.885
It's a black arm band, sir.

05:23.906 --> 05:25.802
I heard the terrible news
about Frank and Louise.

05:25.824 --> 05:27.605
- You knew them?
- From the club.

05:27.614 --> 05:30.225
Ruth told me about them.
They're immensely wealthy, sir.

05:30.285 --> 05:32.297
The club? Higgins,
you're always going on

05:32.309 --> 05:33.777
about how you and Ruth are destitute.

05:33.801 --> 05:35.756
Well, we're paid up
to the end of the year.

05:36.084 --> 05:38.121
They were known as the 'Wisterias', sir.

05:38.246 --> 05:39.642
Aggressively climbing.

05:39.701 --> 05:43.085
- Now, they're members of the British aristocracy.
- Oh? How so?

05:43.136 --> 05:45.441
Their daughter Diana just
married the Earl of Lincoln.

05:46.199 --> 05:48.377
Frank and Louise thought
they were royalty, sir,

05:48.449 --> 05:50.522
but you don't enter that
sphere just by marrying into it.

05:50.546 --> 05:52.412
- Of course not.
- All right, that's enough.

05:52.537 --> 05:53.929
Has the family been informed?

05:53.976 --> 05:56.962
Yes, sir. Diana, and the
Earl, and his parents,

05:56.984 --> 05:58.422
the Duke and Duchess, were in Muskoka.

05:58.425 --> 05:59.622
But they're on their way in today.

05:59.646 --> 06:00.997
They took a suite at the Carlyle.

06:02.793 --> 06:05.626
I'm about to start the
internal examination.

06:05.895 --> 06:07.800
What can you tell me thus far?

06:07.872 --> 06:10.019
There are no lesions, no bruises,

06:10.075 --> 06:12.627
no signs of violence
anywhere on the bodies.

06:13.304 --> 06:14.915
Anything under the fingernails?

06:14.949 --> 06:16.721
Nothing that would suggest a struggle.

06:16.939 --> 06:19.338
My preliminary theory is hypoxemia

06:19.380 --> 06:20.875
caused by drowning.

06:22.541 --> 06:23.679
Curious.

06:25.566 --> 06:27.296
Is there something troubling you?

06:28.383 --> 06:30.475
Well, they were found
at the bottom of a pool,

06:30.488 --> 06:31.975
which would indicate drowning.

06:32.100 --> 06:34.825
But there was nothing
weighing them down.

06:34.902 --> 06:36.879
Bodies do sink when they drown.

06:36.896 --> 06:38.732
It takes about a day before they float.

06:38.775 --> 06:41.659
Oh, I mean prior to the drowning itself.

06:41.913 --> 06:44.697
Suicide cases will often
weigh themselves down

06:44.714 --> 06:47.455
with rocks, anchors, cannonballs...

06:47.580 --> 06:50.147
They must have very much
wanted to take their own lives.

06:50.859 --> 06:52.444
Or they were coerced.

06:53.083 --> 06:56.350
Please notify me when you've
completed the post mortem, Miss Hart.

06:56.351 --> 06:57.715
Of course, sir.

07:10.677 --> 07:12.833
Mr. Crabtree.

07:16.693 --> 07:18.581
Effie Newsome?

07:19.109 --> 07:20.613
We met at Ruth's wedding.

07:20.738 --> 07:23.488
- Yes, it's Constable, actually.
- Ah, yes.

07:25.576 --> 07:27.143
It's a lovely day today.

07:27.173 --> 07:29.900
- Right, if you're looking for Henry, he...
- No, I'm not.

07:29.951 --> 07:32.375
It's you I'm looking for
in my official capacity

07:32.392 --> 07:34.203
as lawyer to Mr. Martin Erskine.

07:34.224 --> 07:37.067
You're a lawyer already? I
thought you were still in school.

07:37.097 --> 07:39.351
Yes, well. I'm almost a lawyer.

07:39.381 --> 07:42.018
- So, this Mr. Erskine is a friend of yours?
- My cousin.

07:42.052 --> 07:44.438
He sustained grievous injuries
in a motor car accident,

07:44.446 --> 07:46.232
and he is seeking recompense.

07:46.357 --> 07:48.843
He's had to miss a family
reunion in Kingston.

07:49.035 --> 07:51.174
He wanted to sue you, but I said

07:51.199 --> 07:54.092
- that as we were already acquainted, I could...
- So, he had his brakes

07:54.101 --> 07:56.394
- repaired in my shop?
- He says they were ruined.

07:56.406 --> 07:59.913
Miss Newsome. I stand behind all
the work done at Bloom and Crabtree.

07:59.998 --> 08:01.629
Correct me if I'm wrong, but

08:01.668 --> 08:03.965
doesn't Henry work there now?

08:13.840 --> 08:17.070
We offer our condolences
at this very difficult time.

08:17.442 --> 08:19.826
We are doing all we can
to apprehend the burglar,

08:19.899 --> 08:22.801
- and when we do...
- Do you believe he is responsible?

08:22.926 --> 08:25.001
That's unknown at this time.

08:25.126 --> 08:27.125
And they were found
in their swimming pool?

08:27.189 --> 08:30.109
I'm afraid so.

08:31.648 --> 08:33.118
There, there, darling.

08:33.522 --> 08:35.626
How could they do this?

08:35.751 --> 08:38.107
They had everything they wanted.

08:38.232 --> 08:41.809
Diana's tired. I'll go
settle her in her room.

08:47.003 --> 08:51.035
What do you say to
this frightful business?

08:51.951 --> 08:55.312
We're here to ask questions
regarding the Westerbrooks.

08:55.387 --> 08:58.212
To be honest, we're investigating
whether it was murder or suicide.

08:58.238 --> 09:00.283
A damn shame.

09:00.509 --> 09:02.912
Though being the soul
of honesty, I must say

09:02.929 --> 09:04.982
I won't miss them too much.

09:05.540 --> 09:06.809
Why do you say that?

09:06.831 --> 09:09.592
Well, they weren't the
best sort of people.

09:09.861 --> 09:11.952
I wouldn't be surprised either way;

09:11.965 --> 09:14.670
they couldn't stick life anymore, or

09:14.795 --> 09:17.056
they angered the wrong person.

09:17.064 --> 09:19.190
Now Richard, these men are only trying

09:19.207 --> 09:20.899
to make sense of what happened.

09:20.950 --> 09:22.900
Do you think they were
the type to commit suicide?

09:22.901 --> 09:27.162
Grafters and strivers...
I'd hardly think so.

09:27.205 --> 09:29.258
They finally got what they were craving:

09:29.280 --> 09:31.107
a family member with a title.

09:31.816 --> 09:33.953
So, they had that to live for?

09:34.141 --> 09:37.121
It certainly seemed
that was all they wanted.

09:37.157 --> 09:39.383
I was just talking with Mrs. Westerbrook

09:39.399 --> 09:40.969
about the Governor General's Ball,

09:41.007 --> 09:44.357
before we went to Muskoka.
It's next Saturday.

09:44.429 --> 09:47.692
They were very much looking
forward to us going too.

09:47.897 --> 09:51.259
I think they rather
wanted to show us off,

09:51.340 --> 09:53.683
like... trick ponies.

09:59.907 --> 10:03.030
So, which is it? Murder or suicide?

10:03.430 --> 10:05.790
Evidence of a break-in does tell me

10:05.807 --> 10:08.449
that the burglar had something
to do with their deaths.

10:08.667 --> 10:12.216
How does one drown
two unwilling victims?

10:12.451 --> 10:13.891
At gunpoint?

10:14.926 --> 10:16.887
I agree it is odd.

10:17.096 --> 10:19.409
Why stage two suicides?

10:19.451 --> 10:21.266
Perhaps he was covering his tracks.

10:21.391 --> 10:24.996
Then why not clean up the
broken vase, or close the window?

10:25.783 --> 10:28.089
What did Miss Hart have
to say about the bodies?

10:28.091 --> 10:30.711
Just that she saw no
evidence of violence.

10:30.737 --> 10:32.794
I'm still awaiting the post-mortem.

10:34.243 --> 10:37.064
It did seem like they had
everything to live for...

10:37.430 --> 10:40.001
wealth, status, success.

10:40.464 --> 10:43.070
Wealth does not equal happiness.

10:43.280 --> 10:44.589
Are you sure?

10:45.775 --> 10:48.943
I don't need a large home to be happy.

10:49.672 --> 10:52.280
It certainly contributes
to my happiness.

10:53.614 --> 10:56.384
Well, then I suppose it
contributes to mine as well.

11:08.585 --> 11:11.223
- George.
- Henry, you're late!

11:11.261 --> 11:14.180
- Ruth likes a long breakfast.
- Henry! This is serious.

11:14.193 --> 11:17.738
The reputation of Bloom and
Crabtree Auto is being impugned!

11:17.907 --> 11:19.774
- I'm sorry, George.
- Look.

11:20.286 --> 11:23.136
The brake rod came
completely free of the clevis.

11:23.758 --> 11:25.258
What? That's impossible.

11:25.270 --> 11:26.995
I distinctly remember
tightening this rod.

11:27.021 --> 11:29.449
- Are you sure?
- On my life, George.

11:31.767 --> 11:33.453
Well, you do believe me, don't you?

11:41.126 --> 11:44.744
I'd like to know how much you
can give me for this silver.

11:45.063 --> 11:47.109
What have we got here?

11:47.429 --> 11:48.936
Detective!

11:49.836 --> 11:52.259
- Constable...
- May I take a look at that?

11:52.502 --> 11:57.061
- I can explain...
- You can explain it on the way, Miss Stubbins.

11:57.099 --> 11:58.650
You're coming with us.

12:08.654 --> 12:11.676
I didn't do it to harm
them, they just have so much.

12:11.919 --> 12:14.501
And you envied their wealth
so much you killed them?

12:14.544 --> 12:17.373
No! No, that's not it at all.

12:18.285 --> 12:21.242
- Then why did you do it?
- He said it would be easy.

12:21.936 --> 12:23.124
Who said that?

12:25.147 --> 12:26.367
Anthony.

12:27.017 --> 12:30.469
Anthony Pottier. But
he wouldn't kill anyone!

12:30.529 --> 12:32.216
You planned this with him?

12:34.883 --> 12:36.724
He would pry open a window

12:36.758 --> 12:39.877
and... and steal the
jewelry and the silver,

12:39.885 --> 12:41.117
and I would sell it.

12:41.743 --> 12:43.613
Where is the jewelry now?

12:44.018 --> 12:46.681
I don't know. He only
gave me the silver.

12:48.505 --> 12:51.803
I need to speak with this Mr.
Pottier. Do you have an address?

12:53.576 --> 12:55.317
We'll get everyone out there looking.

12:55.341 --> 12:57.478
Do you think the maid and this
burglar planned to murder them?

12:57.500 --> 12:59.694
The maid hadn't been with
the Westerbrooks for long;

12:59.715 --> 13:01.488
I see no clear motive.

13:01.527 --> 13:03.836
Perhaps it's just as
she said, a robbery.

13:03.866 --> 13:05.485
Did you talk to their daughter?

13:05.532 --> 13:08.169
Maybe Diana knows if her
parents had any enemies.

13:08.294 --> 13:11.455
Diana did seem distraught. I've
asked Julia to speak with her.

13:11.580 --> 13:14.228
It's a bloody nuisance when
rich people die, Murdoch.

13:16.969 --> 13:21.409
Perhaps my parents suffered from
despair in weakness and defiance...

13:21.801 --> 13:25.282
what Kierkegaard categorized
as the "sickness unto death."

13:25.407 --> 13:27.909
You believe your parents
felt such despair?

13:29.500 --> 13:31.592
They never said, Dr. Ogden.

13:32.129 --> 13:35.394
But Kierkegaard also maintained
that suicide was the greater risk

13:35.407 --> 13:37.822
in those who maintain perfect reserve.

13:38.785 --> 13:40.886
This is a deeply tragic event.

13:41.874 --> 13:43.302
How are you feeling?

13:43.549 --> 13:45.454
I am carrying on.

13:46.059 --> 13:49.424
As my parents would have
wanted me to, I'm sure.

13:49.641 --> 13:53.011
Was there anyone who would have
wanted to harm your parents?

13:53.064 --> 13:55.083
Why do you ask?

13:56.494 --> 13:58.367
We have a guest.

13:58.369 --> 14:01.416
This is Dr. Julia Ogden.

14:02.072 --> 14:04.773
- Pleased to meet you.
- Yes.

14:05.267 --> 14:08.266
This is Persephone. My sister.

14:09.832 --> 14:12.228
Are you here to ask about Mama and Papa?

14:12.276 --> 14:13.826
Yes.

14:13.842 --> 14:16.793
And to see how you and
your sister are feeling.

14:17.288 --> 14:18.977
We have each other.

14:20.057 --> 14:22.434
And where was Persephone
during all of this?

14:22.446 --> 14:25.399
She was away. A chaperoned
shopping trip in New York.

14:25.416 --> 14:28.297
- She's staying with Diana now.
- How are they faring?

14:28.607 --> 14:30.635
They're very intelligent young women.

14:30.877 --> 14:32.912
They seem to be coping as best they can.

14:33.399 --> 14:36.369
Lady Diana stated that
there was no love lost

14:36.420 --> 14:38.560
between her father and father in-law?

14:39.150 --> 14:41.032
The Duke felt the Westerbrooks were

14:41.042 --> 14:43.357
social climbers, completely beneath him.

14:43.482 --> 14:46.413
Still, not a very strong
motive for a double murder.

14:46.976 --> 14:49.375
Well, a man like the Duke
derives his self-image

14:49.396 --> 14:51.764
almost exclusively from who he is,

14:51.771 --> 14:53.642
his title, his position.

14:54.310 --> 14:56.079
If that order was threatened...

14:56.174 --> 14:57.670
He would seek to protect it.

14:57.861 --> 14:59.306
But they were in Muskoka.

14:59.337 --> 15:01.886
It's impossible to travel
there and back in one night.

15:02.599 --> 15:05.612
Well, Miss Hart should have
completed her post-mortem by now.

15:05.649 --> 15:07.540
I'll have a word with her.

15:09.803 --> 15:11.969
How are you finding
Miss Hart in the morgue?

15:12.357 --> 15:15.155
- Do you think she's managing well by herself?
- Oh, quite well...

15:15.280 --> 15:18.658
though she doesn't have quite
your investigative skills.

15:19.655 --> 15:20.983
Yet.

15:26.817 --> 15:27.925
Thank you.

15:28.709 --> 15:30.929
Mr. Erskine is being very generous.

15:30.958 --> 15:33.732
He is only billing for medical
expenses and brake repair.

15:33.940 --> 15:36.522
Your cousin spent $6
on a pair of crutches?!

15:36.543 --> 15:39.882
- Are they made of gold?
- My client will accept cash or cheque.

15:41.718 --> 15:43.534
I will write a cheque today.

15:43.853 --> 15:47.279
I suppose the mistake started when
you hired Henry Higgins-Newsome.

15:47.318 --> 15:48.844
What were you thinking?

15:49.087 --> 15:52.024
I was thinking that he had a
natural ability with motor cars.

15:52.149 --> 15:54.152
It's very noble of you
to help your friend,

15:54.161 --> 15:56.606
but you can't run a charity.
Just look what happened.

15:56.631 --> 15:58.195
It was simple human error.

15:58.489 --> 16:01.131
It was simple, all right.
That's Henry's middle name.

16:01.152 --> 16:03.086
His middle name is Hieronymous,

16:03.095 --> 16:06.001
- and I'll thank you not to slander my friend.
- The man is a menace.

16:06.031 --> 16:07.970
All right, Miss Newsome,
on second thought,

16:08.000 --> 16:09.823
I won't be writing any cheque today.

16:09.879 --> 16:11.374
Are you saying you won't pay?

16:11.382 --> 16:12.724
I'm saying Henry is an honest man.

16:12.741 --> 16:15.600
If he says he fixed that brake
rod properly, then I believe him.

16:15.939 --> 16:17.475
Then we'll see you in court.

16:17.679 --> 16:19.656
We'll take you for
every penny you've got.

16:19.781 --> 16:21.224
I'd like to see it.

16:31.253 --> 16:32.519
Do you see that?

16:32.644 --> 16:34.184
Frothy blood in the lungs.

16:34.309 --> 16:37.243
It could be indicative of a
cardiovascular disorder in one,

16:37.248 --> 16:38.969
but in both?

16:39.433 --> 16:41.363
What else could cause that?

16:41.365 --> 16:43.758
I would say a toxin of some kind.

16:44.333 --> 16:46.616
And you found no evidence of drowning?

16:46.868 --> 16:49.905
Water in the stomach and lungs
would indicate drowning, yes.

16:50.030 --> 16:53.186
But I found something else
in the stomach: ground glass.

16:53.621 --> 16:55.337
They ate glass?

16:55.412 --> 16:58.389
They're very tiny particles
that caused abrasions

16:58.410 --> 17:00.332
in the mouth and in the intestines.

17:03.497 --> 17:05.753
And you found no evidence of narcotics?

17:06.019 --> 17:10.152
No. I've tested for morphine,
codeine; I couldn't find a trace.

17:10.454 --> 17:12.794
All man-made. What of natural toxins?

17:13.300 --> 17:15.815
Venom would paralyze the
central nervous system.

17:15.862 --> 17:18.546
That is how they were
drowned. They were paralyzed.

17:19.113 --> 17:21.830
But it would have to be
introduced into the blood stream.

17:23.096 --> 17:24.705
Hence the ground glass.

17:27.365 --> 17:31.482
- I will need you to find out what was in their system.
- Of course, Detective.

17:34.511 --> 17:36.066
City Morgue.

17:37.506 --> 17:39.152
Yes, I will let him know.

17:40.809 --> 17:42.424
They've found the burglar.

17:47.966 --> 17:49.649
Mr. Pottier.

17:51.371 --> 17:53.074
I've had a look at your fingermarks

17:53.087 --> 17:55.792
and they match those found
in the Westerbrook home.

17:58.467 --> 18:01.062
Oh, they had me over
for tea a few weeks ago.

18:01.088 --> 18:02.515
I don't think so.

18:04.479 --> 18:06.915
I believe you robbed them.

18:08.224 --> 18:10.137
And you are the only suspect

18:10.146 --> 18:12.940
in what is now a double
murder investigation.

18:12.974 --> 18:14.900
Hold on. What did you say?

18:15.365 --> 18:18.198
Come now, Mr. Pottier. Surely,
you know the Westerbrooks are dead.

18:18.215 --> 18:20.269
The papers just said that
they killed themselves.

18:20.303 --> 18:22.731
So, what did you see the night
you were there robbing them?

18:22.733 --> 18:24.701
Were you just there
for the valuables? Or...

18:24.714 --> 18:27.606
- I never saw them.
- So, you were there that night.

18:33.555 --> 18:36.321
Look, Pauline and me, we had a plan.

18:36.648 --> 18:38.479
The Westerbrooks went
to bed at 10 o'clock;

18:38.501 --> 18:41.790
I would rob the place at 2 o'clock
at night and no one would get hurt.

18:42.774 --> 18:44.436
Did they discover you in the home?

18:44.457 --> 18:47.785
No. I am telling you, I never saw
them. I didn't even finish the job.

18:47.845 --> 18:49.054
Why not?

18:50.183 --> 18:53.195
I got the silver, and I was
gonna go further into the house,

18:53.212 --> 18:55.180
up the stairs where Pauline
said I could find jewelry,

18:55.201 --> 18:57.749
- but I saw lights outside.
- Lights?

18:57.874 --> 19:00.028
From a motor car. Coming up the drive.

19:00.083 --> 19:02.103
I got scared, and I
went back out the window.

19:02.124 --> 19:04.101
I even broke a vase on my way out.

19:04.280 --> 19:05.717
On my word.

19:05.955 --> 19:07.382
You're a thief.

19:08.579 --> 19:10.745
I still have my word.

19:16.612 --> 19:18.550
So, the car he saw
belonged to the killer.

19:18.606 --> 19:21.068
I've taken the liberty of
speaking with the neighbours.

19:21.085 --> 19:23.625
Nothing. They appear to have no enemies.

19:23.894 --> 19:26.895
- And the family?
- Well, they were in Muskoka.

19:27.366 --> 19:29.526
So, the fancy place they
most likely stayed at

19:29.547 --> 19:31.460
would have had some motor
cars, don't you think?

19:32.274 --> 19:34.834
Watts... do you think one
could drive a motor car

19:34.843 --> 19:37.600
from Muskoka to Toronto
and back in one night?

19:37.646 --> 19:40.917
Difficult. But perhaps not impossible.

19:41.042 --> 19:44.878
Then let's take the train to this
Muskoka property and find out.

19:52.547 --> 19:54.059
There's only the train
that you boys took.

19:54.080 --> 19:55.593
Runs morning and afternoon.

19:55.755 --> 19:58.724
- And that's how everyone gets here?
- Yes sir.

19:58.954 --> 20:02.030
Before, we had a horse and a
wagon, but times are changing.

20:02.742 --> 20:05.533
How far could an
automobile like this travel?

20:05.535 --> 20:06.959
As long as you've got gas,

20:06.964 --> 20:08.746
you know what you're
doing, I'd say mighty far.

20:08.770 --> 20:11.791
Cooling the engine, gentle on
the brakes, that sort of thing.

20:12.570 --> 20:16.415
Could it make to, say, Toronto and back?

20:16.613 --> 20:18.770
Yeah. I found four empty gas cans

20:18.780 --> 20:20.420
in the back of this
one yesterday morning.

20:20.942 --> 20:22.251
It'd be rough going, but...

20:22.598 --> 20:24.078
it could have been that far and back.

20:24.235 --> 20:26.331
And do you know who drove this car?

20:28.953 --> 20:30.561
That's none of my business, sir.

20:30.602 --> 20:32.702
This is official police business.

20:35.184 --> 20:38.538
I saw the Duke leaving the
main house by the back door

20:39.060 --> 20:40.904
in the evening, two nights ago.

20:42.455 --> 20:45.114
Then I... saw him coming back,

20:45.812 --> 20:49.326
early in the morning. Woke me up.

20:51.831 --> 20:52.915
Thank you.

21:02.983 --> 21:05.969
No, I will not go to your Station!

21:06.094 --> 21:08.228
This is a police investigation, sir.

21:08.272 --> 21:11.921
- Two people are dead!
- They should have got some dogs.

21:12.046 --> 21:14.548
Where were you the night
that the Westerbrooks died?

21:14.673 --> 21:16.984
That is my business,
none of your concern.

21:16.986 --> 21:18.830
I'll ask you again, sir.

21:18.955 --> 21:21.501
- Were you in Toronto?
- I am a Duke,

21:21.535 --> 21:23.674
and a guest in your country.

21:23.704 --> 21:25.886
That doesn't mean you
couldn't commit a crime!

21:26.436 --> 21:27.518
Me?

21:27.841 --> 21:31.697
- A crime? You think I...
- We have evidence

21:31.714 --> 21:34.973
that a motor car left the Muskoka
compound on the night in question.

21:34.999 --> 21:37.071
And it was driven a great distance.

21:37.266 --> 21:39.179
Did you drive it to Toronto?

21:39.208 --> 21:40.773
How could you?

21:41.043 --> 21:42.482
I beg your pardon?

21:42.511 --> 21:44.063
I knew you didn't like them,

21:44.071 --> 21:47.003
but I didn't know the
depth of your hatred.

21:47.386 --> 21:50.589
- You found out, didn't you?
- Found out what?

21:50.602 --> 21:53.469
That they were about to buy
the estate next door to yours.

21:53.486 --> 21:56.644
That was the Marquess
of Rutchford's estate!

21:57.015 --> 22:00.049
- It can't now belong to...
- Commoners?

22:00.174 --> 22:03.991
- What's next, are you going to try to kill me?
- That's enough.

22:04.116 --> 22:06.940
Right, Sir Richard, you're
coming with us to the Station.

22:06.978 --> 22:08.384
Would you mind?

22:23.735 --> 22:24.821
George?

22:25.367 --> 22:27.489
Why the long face?

22:27.510 --> 22:30.157
I can't believe how foolish
I was with Effie Newsome.

22:30.195 --> 22:31.925
Now, she's going to take me to court.

22:31.942 --> 22:34.595
She doesn't have a case.
I fixed that brake rod.

22:34.597 --> 22:36.280
But how can I prove that, Henry?

22:36.301 --> 22:38.557
Well, it's obvious. If
I fixed it correctly,

22:38.574 --> 22:40.236
then this Mr. Erskine is faking.

22:40.537 --> 22:42.928
So, what? He orchestrated
the motor car accident?

22:43.053 --> 22:45.239
Or there never was an accident at all.

22:46.124 --> 22:47.741
And he's pretending to be injured?

22:48.650 --> 22:51.450
Remember when I sprained my
ankle and had to take a week off?

22:52.084 --> 22:55.269
- I went to Ottawa to see the Russian circus.
- Higgins...

22:55.303 --> 22:57.752
George, it was a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

22:58.106 --> 23:00.163
Actually, if you think about
it, anything that happens

23:00.180 --> 23:02.519
once in your lifetime
is once-in-a-lifetime.

23:03.261 --> 23:05.459
You've been talking with
Detective Watts too much.

23:05.461 --> 23:08.195
Mr. Erskine is lying,
and we're gonna catch him.

23:11.168 --> 23:13.614
I just received word from
the real estate company

23:13.623 --> 23:15.728
that the Westerbrooks were
dealing with in England.

23:15.938 --> 23:17.283
Had they bought the property?

23:17.326 --> 23:21.154
They received word not to sell
the Westerbrooks any property.

23:21.181 --> 23:25.255
- Who gave that order?
- The request came from the Somerset household.

23:25.380 --> 23:28.777
So, the Duke did know they were
trying to buy the property next to his.

23:28.902 --> 23:33.153
Come on. You can ask the Duchess
herself if the Duke was at home.

23:34.528 --> 23:36.757
Where is my husband?

23:36.882 --> 23:38.905
In the cells.

23:39.095 --> 23:40.913
Oh, now really,

23:40.950 --> 23:43.397
- you don't think...
- He refused to cooperate with our investigation.

23:43.399 --> 23:44.982
How could he cooperate?

23:45.003 --> 23:47.331
He knows nothing about
the unfortunate events.

23:47.368 --> 23:50.538
Lady Elizabeth, where was
your husband three nights ago?

23:51.012 --> 23:53.007
The last night you were in Muskoka.

23:53.260 --> 23:55.409
Well, he was with me, of course.

23:55.411 --> 23:58.528
- You're quite sure?
- What are you implying?

23:58.922 --> 24:01.068
Ma'am, regardless of your position,

24:01.090 --> 24:02.927
we are permitted to ask these questions.

24:02.943 --> 24:04.678
And I have answered them.

24:04.705 --> 24:06.936
Now, I wish to see my husband.

24:06.958 --> 24:08.662
I hope you're prepared to wait.

24:08.902 --> 24:10.851
Perhaps you should return to your suite?

24:10.969 --> 24:13.679
- We'll notify you if he gets released.
- If?!

24:14.877 --> 24:17.862
I'll be notifying the British Embassy.

24:18.208 --> 24:19.934
Hmph!

24:20.966 --> 24:22.516
Well...

24:22.641 --> 24:24.769
it's been quite a while
since I last heard from them.

24:29.183 --> 24:32.241
- Are we sure this is even the right address?
- Yes, I looked him up.

24:32.366 --> 24:33.865
Well, we've already missed breakfast.

24:33.886 --> 24:36.901
- Are we going to stay so long we miss lunch?
- Well, do you want to pay Effie?

24:36.925 --> 24:38.712
Absolutely not.

24:38.837 --> 24:40.704
George! Look!

24:44.173 --> 24:47.094
My God... he looks injured to me.

24:47.096 --> 24:48.892
"Looks."

24:48.946 --> 24:50.998
Let's follow him.

24:52.976 --> 24:55.648
I suppose you refuse to give
us your whereabouts that night

24:55.652 --> 24:57.738
because you feel a sense of shame?

24:57.740 --> 24:58.818
Shame?

24:58.943 --> 25:00.604
How dare you!

25:00.681 --> 25:01.920
Who were you with?

25:02.222 --> 25:03.842
A lady of the lower classes?

25:03.918 --> 25:06.841
I assure you, definitely not.

25:10.032 --> 25:11.297
All right...

25:12.119 --> 25:15.456
I was with a woman,
but she is not a tart.

25:16.758 --> 25:18.876
We'll need a name to confirm that.

25:18.914 --> 25:20.533
Good God!

25:20.742 --> 25:22.996
What kind of man do you take me for?

25:23.043 --> 25:25.228
I suppose we'll have
to ask someone else.

25:26.609 --> 25:28.240
You've got a look, kid.

25:28.253 --> 25:30.204
Did you ever think
about being on the stage?

25:30.673 --> 25:33.370
Sometimes. I once performed
at the local theatre.

25:33.382 --> 25:34.775
That'll be all, Constable.

25:34.865 --> 25:36.610
Have a seat Mr. Leech.

25:36.735 --> 25:38.912
Tell me what you know
about the Duke of Somerset.

25:39.117 --> 25:41.615
Well, we've attended a
few functions together.

25:41.660 --> 25:44.136
- So, you know him?
- Not well.

25:44.520 --> 25:46.487
Where was he three nights ago?

25:46.489 --> 25:47.830
Three nights...

25:48.371 --> 25:51.525
Wasn't he up at some
luxurious Muskoka home?

25:51.912 --> 25:54.061
That's what we're trying to find out.

25:54.255 --> 25:56.416
Well, let me say,

25:56.424 --> 25:58.042
I'm not the right person to ask

25:58.052 --> 26:01.026
about the Duke's nocturnal adventures.

26:01.056 --> 26:02.441
And who is?

26:02.566 --> 26:07.174
The Duke has been seen in the constant
company of one particular lady.

26:07.176 --> 26:08.458
Quite taken with her.

26:08.483 --> 26:11.326
My sources say it's exclusive.

26:13.517 --> 26:16.589
Well, do we have to buy
a magazine to find out?

26:16.714 --> 26:18.187
Ugh.

26:18.549 --> 26:20.760
- Who said that?
- Oh, come off it.

26:20.829 --> 26:22.448
Apparently, everyone knew.

26:22.573 --> 26:24.489
That isn't the issue here.

26:24.502 --> 26:27.501
We're trying to confirm the Duke's
whereabouts three nights ago.

26:27.714 --> 26:29.291
I can't remember.

26:29.883 --> 26:32.567
Miss Small, I'll remind you
that this is police business.

26:32.610 --> 26:34.787
Since when have the
police been interested

26:34.821 --> 26:36.517
in where dukes spend the night?

26:36.521 --> 26:40.156
Since this particular duke is a
suspect in a murder investigation.

26:40.160 --> 26:43.079
Murder? How exciting.

26:43.117 --> 26:45.248
Were you with the Duke three nights ago?

26:47.681 --> 26:50.784
Fine. I was. All night.

26:50.858 --> 26:53.487
- In Toronto?
- No, in Muskoka.

26:53.489 --> 26:56.356
I was tucked into a little
cottage on the grounds.

26:56.884 --> 26:58.969
Don't look at me like that.

26:59.094 --> 27:01.771
A girl's entitled to a bit of fun.

27:03.275 --> 27:05.831
So the Duke never left Muskoka.

27:07.267 --> 27:08.652
No.

27:12.547 --> 27:14.780
Never in my wildest dreams

27:14.805 --> 27:17.102
did I think I would end up here.

27:17.136 --> 27:19.713
That's what happens when you
feel you're above the law.

27:19.715 --> 27:21.722
I have one more question, sir.

27:21.917 --> 27:24.560
- Fine.
- Did you request that a British

27:24.581 --> 27:27.444
real estate agency not
sell to the Westerbrooks?

27:27.474 --> 27:30.490
I had no idea they wanted
to buy land in England.

27:30.754 --> 27:35.262
But I'm glad someone tried to stop them.

27:36.230 --> 27:38.632
So, if the Duke didn't
know about the estate...

27:39.033 --> 27:41.188
Then who tried to stop the sale?

27:45.673 --> 27:48.075
That's not the right venom.

27:48.077 --> 27:50.331
- Which one?
- Wasp.

27:50.378 --> 27:51.851
And that was the last of it.

27:51.962 --> 27:56.381
I've dosed several rabbits
with ant, snake. Nothing fits.

27:57.028 --> 27:59.648
Come, Miss Hart. It's time
to get out of this morgue.

27:59.656 --> 28:00.819
And go where?

28:00.828 --> 28:03.972
To seek knowledge, beyond that
which passeth our understanding.

28:03.998 --> 28:05.562
And where do we find that?

28:05.575 --> 28:08.089
Hetley Street, just east of Jarvis.

28:08.592 --> 28:10.975
Hmm. Come on, dear.

28:11.293 --> 28:12.798
They do bite,

28:13.168 --> 28:15.135
but we keep them locked up.

28:15.951 --> 28:17.528
You're looking well, my friend.

28:17.537 --> 28:20.580
Oh. It's been a long
time, Detective Watts.

28:20.705 --> 28:22.613
Mr. Sweeting did some

28:22.621 --> 28:25.211
- undercover work for me years ago.
- Ah, yes.

28:25.292 --> 28:27.563
Fraudulent insect sales.

28:28.044 --> 28:29.539
Nasty people.

28:29.664 --> 28:33.029
- You're an entomologist?
- Not just an entomologist.

28:33.071 --> 28:36.139
Author, explorer, and founder

28:36.156 --> 28:39.765
of the British Entomological
Society of British North America.

28:39.786 --> 28:43.527
Detective Watts, you're too
kind. So, what do you want?

28:45.036 --> 28:47.686
- We have a venom problem.
- Go on.

28:47.776 --> 28:50.762
We have to ascertain which venom
was used in a double murder.

28:50.887 --> 28:52.205
Symptoms?

28:52.207 --> 28:55.295
- Paralysis...
- Well, that sounds like most venom,

28:55.333 --> 28:57.728
given the right quantities.

28:58.047 --> 29:00.380
Well, frothy blood in the lungs.

29:00.382 --> 29:02.969
Hmm. What did the bite marks look like?

29:02.994 --> 29:05.796
There were none. It was
ingested in large quantities.

29:05.840 --> 29:07.761
- Oh.
- The victims were given food

29:07.778 --> 29:10.142
containing ground glass,
to cut the intestine

29:10.168 --> 29:12.426
and disperse the venom
into the blood stream.

29:12.428 --> 29:14.113
That's terrible.

29:14.238 --> 29:17.130
I've tested bee, snake, wasp, but...

29:17.198 --> 29:19.533
- nothing matches.
- All Canadian insects?

29:19.535 --> 29:21.835
- Yes.
- Ah! Think bigger.

29:22.060 --> 29:23.837
Bigger insects?

29:24.276 --> 29:27.185
Farther afield, dear Watts.

29:27.202 --> 29:31.445
There's a whole world
of poisonous creatures.

29:31.807 --> 29:34.006
Isn't it wonderful, huh?

29:35.292 --> 29:38.556
Mr. Sweeting, would you happen
to know which insect's venom

29:38.587 --> 29:40.297
would produce this result?

29:40.307 --> 29:44.929
I'm thinking of something
that is easily milked.

29:45.338 --> 29:49.595
To me, it sounds like... scorpion.

29:50.830 --> 29:55.420
This has the most up-to-date
research on their venom.

29:57.792 --> 30:00.540
Mr. Sweeting, would you
mind if we borrow this book?

30:00.617 --> 30:03.156
Not if you promise to
come back and visit.

30:03.195 --> 30:05.998
- Yeah. Certainly.
- Ahem.

30:06.050 --> 30:07.733
- Thank you.
- So long.

30:11.644 --> 30:14.287
The venom given to the
Westerbrooks was from scorpions.

30:14.648 --> 30:16.757
Why would anyone use scorpion venom?

30:16.759 --> 30:18.068
And who would know how to get it?

30:18.092 --> 30:20.332
A scorpion expert.

30:21.257 --> 30:24.385
Diana's husband Albert
is an entomologist?

30:24.436 --> 30:27.341
Who in fact wrote the
book on scorpion venom.

30:27.899 --> 30:30.115
Albert tried to stop his
wife's family from buying

30:30.132 --> 30:32.219
the estate next to him,
and then he killed them.

30:33.246 --> 30:35.876
I'm heading straight to the
Carlyle to arrest Albert.

30:35.878 --> 30:37.699
I'm coming with you.

30:46.727 --> 30:49.142
Excuse us. Police. Pardon me.

30:53.791 --> 30:55.359
It's the young Earl.

30:57.176 --> 30:59.866
It looks like he jumped out the window.

31:08.873 --> 31:11.727
He must have jumped
moments before we arrived.

31:11.791 --> 31:13.491
Are you sure he jumped?

31:13.522 --> 31:15.128
Do you have an alternate
theory, Miss Hart?

31:15.152 --> 31:18.278
Well, his wounds are consistent
with falling from great heights, but

31:18.403 --> 31:21.614
here... there are several
long hairs in his hand.

31:23.352 --> 31:25.052
Well done, Miss Hart.

31:27.596 --> 31:30.566
I've never seen something
like that. Horrible.

31:30.600 --> 31:32.065
It certainly is.

31:32.550 --> 31:35.861
Did you notice the Earl
displaying any odd behaviour?

31:36.420 --> 31:38.179
He jumped out a window.

31:38.823 --> 31:40.105
Before that.

31:40.689 --> 31:44.814
I did hear a shout just before it
happened. It sounded like, "NO!"

31:44.873 --> 31:47.524
- It could have been the Earl.
- No one's in the suite.

31:48.171 --> 31:50.484
- Did the Earl's family check out?
- No.

31:50.740 --> 31:54.993
Hmm. Were any of them
upstairs when the Earl died?

31:55.014 --> 31:57.278
The Duke and Duchess took a
train to Hamilton this morning

31:57.302 --> 31:59.948
- for an outing to the Dundurn zoo.
- And his wife?

32:00.408 --> 32:03.353
I think I saw her crossing through
the lobby, going up to the suite.

32:03.374 --> 32:04.954
Slim, long neck...

32:05.022 --> 32:06.935
she was wearing a veil,
I couldn't be sure.

32:07.293 --> 32:08.388
Thank you.

32:10.553 --> 32:13.863
So, Diana waited for the Duke
and Duchess to leave town,

32:13.918 --> 32:15.521
then pushed the Earl out the window?

32:15.646 --> 32:18.192
Perhaps he confessed the murders to her.

32:19.360 --> 32:20.992
We need to find her.

32:23.598 --> 32:24.881
Hello?

32:25.469 --> 32:26.934
Lady Diana?

32:27.059 --> 32:29.448
I've looked upstairs. No one.

32:29.772 --> 32:32.721
It's odd, though. The rooms
which belong to the sisters

32:32.742 --> 32:35.704
are so sterile, even by your standards.

32:35.789 --> 32:37.843
No personal effects at all.

32:52.172 --> 32:53.787
A library?

32:54.336 --> 32:57.442
It's an odd room to be
locking from the outside.

32:58.741 --> 33:00.075
Perhaps...

33:00.087 --> 33:02.026
it's more than a library.

33:04.152 --> 33:05.503
A classroom?

33:05.878 --> 33:08.796
Look at all these textbooks
and composition books:

33:08.921 --> 33:11.557
Latin, algebra, geography,

33:11.570 --> 33:13.555
- it goes on...
- Julia did say that the girls

33:13.559 --> 33:15.375
seemed to be very well-educated.

33:15.500 --> 33:19.290
If they got through half of
these, I would say she's right.

33:19.827 --> 33:22.111
There's one small window.

33:22.132 --> 33:23.764
No distractions.

33:25.341 --> 33:28.413
Watts, according to this log book,

33:28.456 --> 33:32.461
the girls spent upwards
of 12 hours in this room

33:32.640 --> 33:34.097
nearly every day.

33:35.396 --> 33:38.484
I've seen something like this before.

33:39.758 --> 33:41.961
It's used to help correct posture.

33:42.932 --> 33:46.128
It's not something you'd want
to use on growing girls, though.

33:46.656 --> 33:49.779
Unless you were trying to
raise perfect young women.

33:51.101 --> 33:54.438
This book lists all of
the eligible dukes, earls,

33:54.459 --> 33:57.665
and princes in England
and throughout Europe.

33:57.697 --> 34:00.445
I take it Albert, Earl
of Lincoln is there?

34:03.241 --> 34:05.056
He's the only one bookmarked.

34:05.380 --> 34:09.034
And a cataloguing of
all of his interests,

34:09.350 --> 34:12.398
chief among them... entomology.

34:15.428 --> 34:17.835
It appears he wasn't the only one

34:17.856 --> 34:19.896
with an interest in the little critters.

34:23.188 --> 34:26.563
Albert didn't collect the venom
used to kill the Westerbrooks.

34:26.591 --> 34:28.150
She did.

34:28.348 --> 34:30.909
Every little thing for their daughters.

34:33.668 --> 34:35.283
Anything?

34:36.199 --> 34:37.664
There! To the right.

34:37.712 --> 34:39.560
- What? What?
- To the right!

34:40.007 --> 34:42.106
Ah. There he is.

34:42.143 --> 34:43.922
Let's make a move. You lead.

34:50.879 --> 34:52.380
Look now.

34:52.641 --> 34:54.473
He's still using his crutches, Henry,

34:54.484 --> 34:56.598
and we've followed him
halfway across Toronto.

34:56.630 --> 34:58.659
He's a fine actor.

34:58.784 --> 35:00.987
Or he's not acting at all.

35:00.992 --> 35:05.089
Look, Henry, I've indulged
in this charade all morning.

35:05.214 --> 35:07.709
Perhaps it's time for
me to face the facts:

35:07.760 --> 35:10.628
this man is actually injured,
and I need to pay him.

35:10.641 --> 35:14.335
I'm sorry, George. I guess I did
make a mistake. I'm such a dunce.

35:14.403 --> 35:16.376
Everybody makes mistakes, Henry.

35:16.764 --> 35:19.294
Hold on... look.

35:22.549 --> 35:24.139
Why's he going in there?

35:31.468 --> 35:32.890
Why am I here?

35:33.857 --> 35:36.098
Lady Diana. Please, have a seat.

35:39.993 --> 35:42.600
We have some unanswered questions.

35:42.924 --> 35:44.373
Well, of course.

35:44.498 --> 35:46.686
You both have such lively minds.

35:48.352 --> 35:51.169
Your parents did not commit suicide.

35:51.574 --> 35:53.163
They were poisoned.

35:53.696 --> 35:57.565
And the resulting paralysis made
it possible for them to be drowned.

35:57.810 --> 36:00.158
Poisoned? How?

36:00.435 --> 36:01.925
Scorpion venom.

36:02.905 --> 36:04.320
Albert!

36:05.249 --> 36:07.086
Albert killed my parents.

36:07.299 --> 36:10.580
- Do you know that he was an entomologist?
- We do...

36:10.906 --> 36:13.073
but Albert wasn't responsible.

36:13.627 --> 36:16.375
Your parents worked you
very hard, didn't they?

36:16.810 --> 36:18.902
What does that have to do with anything?

36:19.218 --> 36:22.328
I went to your home
and saw your study room.

36:22.999 --> 36:26.040
I saw how you were
isolated, forced to study,

36:26.222 --> 36:28.437
forced to have perfect posture.

36:28.475 --> 36:32.741
I wore that rod every day
since my 10th birthday and yes,

36:33.114 --> 36:35.281
my posture is perfect.

36:36.468 --> 36:38.932
Were you allowed any friends, Diana?

36:39.244 --> 36:40.985
Interests of your own?

36:41.672 --> 36:45.416
I was bred solely to
marry a fine husband.

36:45.672 --> 36:48.478
Did they have similar
plans for Persephone?

36:50.683 --> 36:53.324
The man Mother selected for Persephone

36:53.367 --> 36:55.428
was three times her age.

36:55.950 --> 36:57.857
And you wanted to stop it.

36:58.256 --> 37:00.808
Why should she have
to follow in my path?

37:01.788 --> 37:04.014
I got them the status they wanted.

37:04.035 --> 37:06.245
She deserves a life of her own.

37:13.216 --> 37:15.453
We found these creatures in your room.

37:15.672 --> 37:18.720
Along with the necessary
tools to extract their venom.

37:19.270 --> 37:21.255
Albert's interests are my own.

37:22.013 --> 37:25.252
Yes, but you drove that
car from Muskoka that night

37:25.264 --> 37:26.636
and killed them.

37:26.871 --> 37:28.660
It could only have been you.

37:29.338 --> 37:32.210
And then made it appear as
though it were a suicide.

37:33.829 --> 37:36.799
I couldn't let them
destroy Persephone as well.

37:37.651 --> 37:39.007
And Albert?

37:39.910 --> 37:41.844
Did he realize what you'd done?

37:42.833 --> 37:45.233
He was standing in the bedroom window,

37:45.956 --> 37:47.800
shouting that I would go to jail

37:47.830 --> 37:50.433
and that Persephone would have no one.

37:52.700 --> 37:54.643
I ran towards him...

37:55.683 --> 37:57.630
and pushed.

37:59.416 --> 38:03.714
You wanted to paralyze your
parents before drowning them.

38:04.166 --> 38:06.263
But why use scorpion venom?

38:06.280 --> 38:07.639
To frame Albert?

38:08.354 --> 38:11.610
Because it's known as the most rare

38:11.858 --> 38:15.333
and expensive liquid in all the world.

38:16.544 --> 38:18.325
Why does that matter?

38:20.463 --> 38:23.369
They always wanted the very best.

38:26.685 --> 38:28.955
I knew that she was desperately unhappy,

38:28.968 --> 38:31.179
- but to kill her own...
- She killed her parents,

38:31.221 --> 38:33.079
but she didn't kill her husband.

38:33.204 --> 38:36.501
- She just confessed to killing him.
- Yes, but her confession was false.

38:36.626 --> 38:39.381
He was pushed out the living
room window, not the bedroom.

38:39.696 --> 38:41.094
Why would she lie about that?

38:41.136 --> 38:45.150
To protect the one person in this
world that she truly cares about.

38:45.490 --> 38:49.729
- Constable, you are too much.
- You can call me John.

38:49.784 --> 38:51.663
Tell me another... John.

38:51.706 --> 38:53.269
All right. Let's see...

38:53.640 --> 38:56.153
A farmer walks into his barn.

38:56.192 --> 38:57.602
Detective.

38:58.037 --> 39:02.102
Constable. Persephone,
please come with us.

39:09.363 --> 39:10.841
Miss Westerbrook,

39:10.966 --> 39:13.977
what did your sister tell you
about your parents' deaths?

39:14.309 --> 39:16.120
That they committed suicide.

39:16.990 --> 39:18.503
They did not.

39:20.880 --> 39:25.264
- But that's what she said...
- Your sister just confessed to killing your parents.

39:25.605 --> 39:28.532
She also confessed to the
murder of her husband Albert.

39:28.554 --> 39:29.866
That's impossible!

39:30.032 --> 39:33.943
We have an eyewitness description
of a woman entering the suite,

39:34.068 --> 39:37.599
her hair in Albert's
fist, and her confession.

39:37.803 --> 39:40.653
She'll be going to prison
for a very long time.

39:45.280 --> 39:47.240
She didn't kill Albert...

39:49.468 --> 39:51.364
Why don't you tell us what happened?

39:53.609 --> 39:55.833
My sister told me that
I could live with her,

39:56.220 --> 39:58.210
now that my parents were gone.

39:59.322 --> 40:02.458
We would travel, just the two of us.

40:02.659 --> 40:05.275
- I know she did it, Persephone.
- What are you saying?

40:05.335 --> 40:07.324
I woke up one night, in Muskoka.

40:07.377 --> 40:08.877
Diana wasn't there.

40:09.105 --> 40:10.499
I only just realized

40:10.568 --> 40:12.051
that was the night your parents died.

40:12.068 --> 40:14.326
- That doesn't prove anything.
- She killed them,

40:14.351 --> 40:15.791
and accused my father.

40:16.004 --> 40:17.512
She'll blame me next.

40:18.071 --> 40:20.879
I won't go to prison for
a woman that hates me.

40:20.900 --> 40:22.616
Don't talk about Diana like that!

40:22.629 --> 40:25.292
Your sister will hang for what she did!

40:34.116 --> 40:36.915
My sister was only trying to protect me.

40:39.041 --> 40:41.870
You knew what she did for you,
and you were doing the same.

40:42.322 --> 40:44.345
We only have each other.

40:45.935 --> 40:48.550
All our lives, we've
only had each other.

40:49.952 --> 40:52.346
We just wanted to be together.

41:07.067 --> 41:09.176
Ah. Thank you for coming.

41:09.231 --> 41:11.271
I was pleased you came to your senses.

41:11.288 --> 41:14.169
- It's easier not to get the court involved.
- Quite right, indeed.

41:14.544 --> 41:18.267
- But why did you want to meet here?
- Well, actually, Miss Newsome,

41:18.463 --> 41:21.485
I was wondering if you
would do me the honour?

41:21.965 --> 41:24.326
You can call me Effie.

41:24.790 --> 41:26.669
You can call me Constable.

41:32.000 --> 41:35.575
Good! Let the music move you!

41:36.444 --> 41:38.340
One and two.

41:38.465 --> 41:39.848
Hold it.

41:39.870 --> 41:41.933
- Fabulous.
- Do you dance, Miss Newsome?

41:42.150 --> 41:43.662
Occasionally.

41:46.210 --> 41:47.821
Please lead us.

41:48.115 --> 41:50.987
- Ah.
- I do love this song.

41:51.166 --> 41:54.260
- Oh, I've never danced to it.
- Let me show you.

41:54.385 --> 41:55.517
What?

41:57.280 --> 42:00.281
Just one dance, and then we
will conclude our business.

42:00.307 --> 42:02.697
I very much look forward
to that conclusion.

42:02.867 --> 42:04.742
I must say, Constable Crabtree,

42:04.763 --> 42:07.687
you really are a marvellous dancer.

42:08.632 --> 42:10.238
MARTY?!

42:11.207 --> 42:12.897
Good day, Miss Newsome.

42:13.702 --> 42:16.665
- How could you?
- Oh, my!

42:16.790 --> 42:20.000
You come with me. No, you
come with me young man!

42:30.399 --> 42:32.136
It's time, Persephone.

42:32.520 --> 42:35.577
- Where are you taking her?
- Your sister is still a child.

42:35.604 --> 42:38.080
She'll be entering juvenile reformatory.

42:38.096 --> 42:40.765
- Can't we stay together?
- I'm sorry.

42:40.807 --> 42:42.708
I'll be recommending leniency.

42:42.740 --> 42:45.110
No! Please, let us stay together!

42:45.142 --> 42:49.322
- This is the only choice.
- Darling, listen to me.

42:50.954 --> 42:53.332
- You must be strong.
- Diana!

42:54.069 --> 42:55.540
If I don't see you again...

42:55.665 --> 42:58.825
just know that I tried
to make you happy.

42:58.846 --> 43:00.330
And I you.

43:06.235 --> 43:08.412
- It's time.
- No.

43:08.485 --> 43:11.612
No. No. No. No.
