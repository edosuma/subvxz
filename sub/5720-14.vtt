FEMALE NEWS ANCHOR: ...Ohio
girls who left home last week

00:53.979 --> 00:57.568
to join the fundamentalist
Islamic group Hizb Al-Shahid.

00:57.569 --> 01:00.688
Dr. Amani, how does a group like this

01:00.689 --> 01:04.477
convince two 16-year-old
girls to leave home

01:04.479 --> 01:06.728
to join a violent
extremist group in Libya?

01:06.729 --> 01:08.778
Hot bearded dudes with
guns, I'm guessing.

01:08.779 --> 01:10.821
- Shh. Shh.
- AMANI (on TV): I think they work like any group

01:10.822 --> 01:12.188
trying to recruit believers.

01:12.189 --> 01:13.938
They appeal to what's missing.

01:13.939 --> 01:16.358
You feel like your life
is boring and empty?

01:16.359 --> 01:18.568
Your parents don't understand you?

01:18.569 --> 01:21.018
Come join us and help
build paradise on Earth,

01:21.019 --> 01:23.728
restore Islam to its rightful
place in a new world order.

01:23.729 --> 01:25.979
Oh, come on. They couldn't
have joined the Girl Scouts?

01:26.004 --> 01:26.729
Shh!

01:26.730 --> 01:28.068
WOMAN: But these kids had to know

01:28.069 --> 01:30.148
they were joining a
violent extremist group.

01:30.149 --> 01:33.818
The name, Hizb Al-Shahid
means, "Party of Martyrs."

01:33.819 --> 01:36.108
You've got the suicide bombings,
the beheading videos...

01:36.109 --> 01:36.745
Hey!

01:36.769 --> 01:39.476
Little early in the morning
for the worst of humanity.

01:39.477 --> 01:40.330
Who wants waffles?

01:40.330 --> 01:41.938
Censoring media access much?

01:41.939 --> 01:43.688
Hey, first step to tyranny.

01:43.689 --> 01:45.068
So proud.

01:45.069 --> 01:47.108
Listen, as opposed to that...

01:47.109 --> 01:49.108
Mom is hosting a conference this week

01:49.109 --> 01:50.339
featuring Noura Al-Kitabi.

01:50.340 --> 01:51.568
Oh.

01:51.569 --> 01:52.818
I think we should all go.

01:52.819 --> 01:54.688
Isn't that the girl who
got acid attacked?

01:54.689 --> 01:57.278
That is the the young woman

01:57.279 --> 01:59.228
who stood up against
the Saudi government

01:59.229 --> 02:01.358
to demand an equal education
and the right to work.

02:01.359 --> 02:02.898
And, yes, she was violently assaulted,

02:02.899 --> 02:05.228
but is committed to speaking out.

02:05.229 --> 02:06.398
That sounds cool.

02:06.399 --> 02:07.688
It's way cool.

02:07.689 --> 02:10.108
And we're talking weapons-grade?

02:10.109 --> 02:12.219
Well, that can't be good.

02:14.319 --> 02:15.518
Hi. Good morning.

02:15.519 --> 02:17.231
- Good morning. - Morning.
- Morning.

02:17.232 --> 02:19.438
Hang on.

02:19.439 --> 02:21.478
Listen, about Alison's
parent-teacher conference

02:21.479 --> 02:23.108
today at 11:15... I have not forgotten.

02:23.109 --> 02:24.978
I got it covered, if you can't make it.

02:24.979 --> 02:27.148
Oh, no, I will make it.

02:27.149 --> 02:29.898
Not least because I am hosting

02:29.899 --> 02:33.778
a Worldwide Partnership on
Girls' and Women's Education.

02:33.779 --> 02:34.729
I hope you realize this means

02:34.730 --> 02:35.858
you have to make it to mine, too.

02:35.859 --> 02:37.898
Yes, of course. I will. I want...

02:37.899 --> 02:40.108
Whoa. When is that?
I don't... Hang on. Hold on.

02:40.109 --> 02:43.108
Blake, listen, will you just put
that file together for me,

02:43.109 --> 02:45.018
and I'll bring it to the NSA meeting,

02:45.019 --> 02:48.018
and just keep me updated
if there's anything? Okay?

02:48.019 --> 02:49.688
Thank you. Bye.

02:49.689 --> 02:51.778
Is everything okay?

02:51.779 --> 02:53.728
Yeah. Another day,
another potential disaster

02:53.729 --> 02:55.688
no one will ever hear about.

02:55.689 --> 02:56.978
Here's to government work.

02:56.979 --> 02:58.149
Okay.

02:58.150 --> 02:59.318
Bye. I got to go. Love you.

02:59.319 --> 03:00.781
- Love you.
- Bye. Love you, love you, love you.

03:00.782 --> 03:02.481
- Bye. Love you.
- Bye. See you.

03:02.482 --> 03:05.358
DALTON: <i>You're telling me DOD</i>

03:05.359 --> 03:07.358
and Cybercom, the entire
intelligence community,

03:07.359 --> 03:08.688
none of you

03:08.689 --> 03:11.778
could stop China from stealing
a key piece of our defense?

03:11.779 --> 03:13.278
To be clear, Mr. President,

03:13.279 --> 03:15.728
the data acquisition may not
have included every component

03:15.729 --> 03:17.778
of the long-range strike bomber.

03:17.779 --> 03:19.978
And when will we know for sure?
When one of them is

03:19.979 --> 03:21.608
heading for us?

03:21.609 --> 03:24.278
Sir, um, I have a relationship
with Foreign Minister Chen.

03:24.279 --> 03:26.478
Maybe I could reach out

03:26.479 --> 03:28.568
and determine the extent of the breach.

03:28.569 --> 03:30.438
She did it before
with the space station.

03:30.439 --> 03:32.278
At least then we'd know
what we're looking at

03:32.279 --> 03:33.858
and proceed from there.

03:33.859 --> 03:35.608
See what you can find out.

03:35.609 --> 03:38.648
If I could also mention
the truckload of uranium

03:38.649 --> 03:41.858
that was stolen outside of
Tiraspol in Moldova last night.

03:41.859 --> 03:44.358
CIA is aware of the theft.

03:44.359 --> 03:46.259
We're fully tracking
the situation, sir.

03:46.259 --> 03:47.358
Do we know who stole it,

03:47.359 --> 03:49.518
or God help us, what they plan to do

03:49.519 --> 03:51.108
with an entire truckload of uranium?

03:51.109 --> 03:52.438
ELIZABETH: Well, the theft could

03:52.439 --> 03:54.898
lead back to any number
of interested parties.

03:54.899 --> 03:57.898
There's been a rise in
organized crime in the area,

03:57.899 --> 04:00.818
as well as several
politically-motivated groups.

04:00.819 --> 04:03.228
Let's hope those Ukrainian rebels

04:03.229 --> 04:05.068
aren't getting the band back together.

04:05.069 --> 04:07.778
I'd like to propose

04:07.779 --> 04:10.160
State's International Security
and Nonproliferation Bureau

04:10.160 --> 04:10.778
take the lead

04:10.779 --> 04:12.029
on tracking this.

04:12.030 --> 04:13.278
Head up a team.

04:13.279 --> 04:13.895
Great.

04:13.895 --> 04:15.859
Intelligence, Energy and
Defense will give you

04:15.859 --> 04:17.901
- all the support you need.
- DENNIS: Sir, if I may?

04:17.902 --> 04:19.688
One truckload of spent fuel rods

04:19.689 --> 04:22.067
likely stolen by Moldovan thugs,

04:22.069 --> 04:24.068
with no expertise in
handling the material,

04:24.069 --> 04:27.728
is hardly what I would
deem a priority situation

04:27.729 --> 04:29.861
- for Intelligence.
- EPHRAIM: Given our concerns

04:29.862 --> 04:33.818
over the recent cyber breach
in Defense, I would concur.

04:33.819 --> 04:35.228
If I can answer that...

04:35.229 --> 04:37.858
Furthermore, our threat analysis
rates small-scale acquisition

04:37.859 --> 04:39.978
of radiological material

04:39.979 --> 04:42.818
a significantly low threat.

04:42.819 --> 04:45.018
Based on what evidence?

04:45.019 --> 04:47.478
Since 9/11, there have been
only two known threats

04:47.479 --> 04:49.938
to weaponize radiological material.

04:49.939 --> 04:54.188
Well, my WMD team felt
that it merited a report,

04:54.189 --> 04:57.728
and I'd like for them to follow
up on it... with support.

04:57.729 --> 05:00.318
Because I-I do think that it was

05:00.319 --> 05:03.108
the lack of cooperation
between our offices

05:03.109 --> 05:05.568
that provided the conditions

05:05.569 --> 05:07.688
for the worst terrorist
attack in U.S. history,

05:07.689 --> 05:09.778
which, until then, was unprecedented.

05:09.779 --> 05:12.108
DALTON: Intelligence certainly has

05:12.109 --> 05:14.778
its hands full dealing
with the cyber breach.

05:14.779 --> 05:19.429
State will take the lead,
as I believe I said.

05:20.899 --> 05:24.068
We'll keep the China breach
under the radar, obviously.

05:24.069 --> 05:26.358
And I don't want to make
any deals with China.

05:26.359 --> 05:27.938
Just get the truth.

05:27.939 --> 05:29.901
- Yes, sir.
- Mr. President.

05:29.902 --> 05:32.438
General Ellerman, it's great
to have you on the team.

05:32.439 --> 05:33.688
It's a pleasure to serve.

05:33.689 --> 05:35.648
I was told there'd be donuts.

05:35.649 --> 05:37.978
Well, we'll set you up over at State.

05:37.979 --> 05:39.978
Looking forward to working with you.

05:39.979 --> 05:42.818
Don't ever make the president
repeat himself again.

05:42.819 --> 05:44.068
Bess?

05:44.069 --> 05:46.389
(low, indistinct
conversation in background)

05:48.019 --> 05:49.518
Can I just ask:

05:49.519 --> 05:53.778
Has CIA always been that
territorial, and I just forgot?

05:53.779 --> 05:55.228
No idea.

05:55.229 --> 05:57.068
I tend to let the kittens fight it out.

05:57.069 --> 06:00.228
About your, uh, your
Women's Education thing...

06:00.229 --> 06:02.438
You mean my Worldwide
Partnership for Girls'

06:02.439 --> 06:05.728
and Women's Education
Conference that I am hosting?

06:05.729 --> 06:07.778
I got a request from
the Saudi ambassador...

06:07.779 --> 06:10.068
the girl you've got as
your keynote speaker...

06:10.069 --> 06:12.358
Noura Al-Kitabi. You do
actually know this stuff.

06:12.359 --> 06:14.978
They want to know if you
can look for someone else.

06:14.979 --> 06:16.608
What?!

06:16.609 --> 06:18.568
Apparently, this king is
sensitive about her.

06:18.569 --> 06:20.568
She's been critical
of the royal family,

06:20.569 --> 06:22.018
we've got this big arms
deal in the works...

06:22.019 --> 06:24.818
You're asking me to disinvite

06:24.819 --> 06:28.318
an internationally-renowned
champion of education...

06:28.319 --> 06:31.608
a girl who was acid-attacked
for it, no less...

06:31.609 --> 06:33.438
to protect an arms deal?

06:33.439 --> 06:36.228
And not publicly offend one
of our most important allies

06:36.229 --> 06:38.068
in the Middle East? Yes.

06:38.069 --> 06:40.018
If the royal family has such a problem

06:40.019 --> 06:42.108
with what its most celebrated citizen

06:42.109 --> 06:44.108
is saying about them publicly,
maybe they should...

06:44.109 --> 06:45.898
oh, I don't know...

06:45.899 --> 06:48.438
give half their citizens the
right to an equal education.

06:48.439 --> 06:50.189
Oh, yeah...

06:50.190 --> 06:51.548
Or how about just letting them drive?

06:51.549 --> 06:54.481
- Why don't we start there?
- I thought you might see it that way,

06:54.482 --> 06:56.858
so I made a counterproposal.

06:56.859 --> 06:59.648
No one from our side
appears with her publicly.

06:59.649 --> 07:01.978
I'm hosting the conference.

07:01.979 --> 07:04.148
How can I not appear
with my keynote speaker?!

07:04.149 --> 07:06.728
This arms deal creates 5,000 new jobs,

07:06.729 --> 07:08.108
most of them in swing states.

07:08.109 --> 07:09.938
But by all means,
you tell the president

07:09.939 --> 07:11.608
you want to put that at risk

07:11.609 --> 07:13.778
so you can get your picture
taken with a teenager.

07:13.779 --> 07:17.148
She's 20, and neither one
of us is even worthy enough

07:17.149 --> 07:20.188
to shine her shoes, so don't
strong-arm me, Russell.

07:20.189 --> 07:21.978
Once the arms deal goes through,

07:21.979 --> 07:24.608
the two of you can go on
<i>Amazing Race</i> if you want to.

07:24.609 --> 07:27.398
Just lay low, avoid the cameras.

07:27.399 --> 07:29.478
That's all I'm asking.

07:29.479 --> 07:31.188
(sighs)

07:31.189 --> 07:32.189
All right.

07:32.190 --> 07:34.188
I'll get word to Prince Asim.

07:34.189 --> 07:35.978
No, I will.

07:35.979 --> 07:39.309
Since he should have come to me
about it in the first place.

07:40.439 --> 07:42.179
Gently, please.

07:43.899 --> 07:45.318
NADINE: <i>This is the full itinerary</i>

07:45.319 --> 07:47.188
for the Education Conference
for your approval.

07:47.189 --> 07:49.778
Segall University requested
an additional appearance

07:49.779 --> 07:51.978
with Noura Al-Kitabi at
their STEAM Foundation.

07:51.979 --> 07:55.108
Yeah, I actually won't be
appearing with Noura

07:55.109 --> 07:58.858
at <i>any </i> public events during
or around the conference.

07:58.859 --> 08:03.148
Apparently, the king doesn't
like to feel criticized

08:03.149 --> 08:06.108
by a college student, or
he won't buy our F-18s.

08:06.109 --> 08:07.484
The itinerary will be adjusted.

08:07.485 --> 08:08.858
Yup.

08:08.859 --> 08:11.728
All right, I, uh... I need to
speak with the Saudi ambassador.

08:11.729 --> 08:12.596
I'll set up a call.

08:12.597 --> 08:15.108
Ma'am, Walter Nowack from
the International Security

08:15.109 --> 08:17.518
and Nonproliferation Bureau is
waiting in the conference room.

08:17.518 --> 08:19.253
- Great.
- Do they have windows on the first floor?

08:19.253 --> 08:21.278
Because that dude looks like
one of those deep-sea fish

08:21.279 --> 08:23.139
that's never seen the sun.

08:24.269 --> 08:25.579
ELIZABETH: Walter.

08:25.580 --> 08:26.888
Ah.

08:26.889 --> 08:28.308
It's nice to see you again.

08:28.309 --> 08:29.808
A summoning to the seventh floor.

08:29.809 --> 08:31.221
- I'm all atwitter.
- (laughs)

08:31.222 --> 08:32.888
We wanted to review your report

08:32.889 --> 08:34.428
on the stolen uranium in Moldova.

08:34.429 --> 08:36.931
- Ah!
- You know Jay Whitman, my senior policy advisor?

08:36.932 --> 08:39.018
In name if not in deed.

08:39.019 --> 08:40.888
Good to meet you, sir.

08:40.889 --> 08:42.178
Just Jay.

08:42.179 --> 08:44.678
Can I get you some coffee?

08:44.679 --> 08:46.268
Please. Please.

08:46.269 --> 08:47.519
Have a seat.

08:47.520 --> 08:48.768
Yes. (laughs)

08:48.769 --> 08:51.978
You know, we-we still
use disposable cups

08:51.979 --> 08:53.768
on the first floor.

08:53.769 --> 08:56.478
It's astonishing to think of detritus

08:56.479 --> 08:58.808
from the Colin Powell era

08:58.809 --> 09:01.598
still moldering in a
landfill somewhere.

09:01.599 --> 09:04.808
Like so many of our
shouts into the void.

09:05.109 --> 09:06.504
Milk or sugar?

09:06.505 --> 09:07.898
Black.

09:07.899 --> 09:09.698
Thank you.

09:09.699 --> 09:13.368
Walter, we're, uh... we're gonna
be putting together a team

09:13.369 --> 09:15.451
- on this situation in Moldova,
- Ah.

09:15.452 --> 09:17.618
And Jay will be your point person.

09:17.619 --> 09:20.318
It's a shame my report
of five months ago

09:20.319 --> 09:25.028
warning of the effect
of corruption on securing

09:25.029 --> 09:27.479
nuclear material in the
former Soviet states...

09:28.489 --> 09:31.198
...failed to gain any attention...

09:31.199 --> 09:32.519
but here we are.

09:34.739 --> 09:36.948
So, organized crime
is your operating theory?

09:36.949 --> 09:40.738
Uh, theory.

09:40.739 --> 09:43.488
You're familiar with Transnistria?

09:43.489 --> 09:46.028
Little breakaway region of Moldova

09:46.029 --> 09:49.078
that the EU can't seem to control.

09:49.079 --> 09:52.738
It's a hotbed for drug
and arms smuggling,

09:52.739 --> 09:56.948
human trafficking and other...
recreational activities.

09:56.949 --> 10:01.658
After the last election, the
crime syndicates now exert

10:01.659 --> 10:04.908
their influence at the very
top levels of government.

10:04.909 --> 10:08.318
It's not my operating theory, Jay.

10:08.319 --> 10:10.988
It's... it's reality.

10:10.989 --> 10:15.078
As I said in my report...
fi... five months ago.

10:15.079 --> 10:17.238
I'll send you another copy.

10:17.239 --> 10:19.948
I'm sure we still have it.

10:20.149 --> 10:22.278
Good. Now...

10:22.279 --> 10:24.688
looking more closely

10:24.689 --> 10:27.358
at the details of our uranium heist...

10:27.359 --> 10:31.188
Here's the truck leaving
the nuclear facility.

10:31.189 --> 10:33.318
Here's the driver.

10:33.319 --> 10:36.188
Ah, ah. This is the guy
I'm interested in.

10:36.189 --> 10:37.438
JAY: Who is that?

10:37.439 --> 10:41.318
That's the chief inspector
of the power plant.

10:41.319 --> 10:42.858
The inspector was in the truck?

10:42.859 --> 10:46.148
Ah. Well, it seems the reach

10:46.149 --> 10:49.518
of the first floor once
again exceeds that

10:49.519 --> 10:52.898
of the so-called
intelligence community.

10:52.899 --> 10:55.479
And we do it all with disposable cups.

10:56.939 --> 10:58.491
Walter, I'm sorry. I-I have to run

10:58.491 --> 11:00.358
to another meeting,
but we'll talk soon.

11:00.359 --> 11:02.188
Oh.

11:02.189 --> 11:07.068
Well, we shall bask in the
fading glow of your attention.

11:07.069 --> 11:09.269
(laughs)

11:10.859 --> 11:12.858
I know.

11:12.859 --> 11:14.188
Too much.

11:14.189 --> 11:15.568
Ah.

11:15.569 --> 11:18.577
Hey, I can just make Alison's
parent-teacher conference.

11:18.578 --> 11:19.608
Will you get the cars ready?

11:19.609 --> 11:22.635
I would, but you have a visitor
from the FBI in your office.

11:22.635 --> 11:25.544
Marguerite Sanchez, Deputy
Director of Counter-Terrorism?

11:25.545 --> 11:26.505
She said it was urgent.

11:26.506 --> 11:28.544
Like miss-my-daughter's-conference

11:28.545 --> 11:29.834
that-I-promised to-go-to urgent?

11:29.835 --> 11:32.834
Well, if you're asking me to
weigh Quakers versus terrorists,

11:32.835 --> 11:35.044
I think the Quakers can wait.

11:35.045 --> 11:36.754
All right, have the cars ready.

11:36.755 --> 11:38.967
- I'm gonna see if I can make this quick.
- Yes, ma'am.

11:38.968 --> 11:40.544
WOMAN: <i>As you may be aware,</i>

11:40.545 --> 11:43.384
I've been heading up a team
investigating the Omer sisters.

11:43.385 --> 11:48.594
Right, the Ohio girls who were
recruited by Hizb Al-Shahid.

11:48.595 --> 11:50.253
We've been working
with assets in Libya,

11:50.254 --> 11:52.213
where supposedly, they joined up

11:52.214 --> 11:55.003
with their recruiters three
days ago, but no leads.

11:55.004 --> 12:00.673
Then the Tunisian government
came through with this.

12:00.674 --> 12:02.874
Uh... here.

12:06.964 --> 12:08.673
It's from a security cam

12:08.674 --> 12:11.043
outside a mosque in Tunis
where the girls stopped

12:11.044 --> 12:13.244
on their way to Libya.

12:15.634 --> 12:16.923
ELIZABETH: Just a guess,

12:16.925 --> 12:19.333
I'm thinking those are
<i>not</i> the recruiters

12:19.334 --> 12:20.833
they were expecting.

12:20.834 --> 12:22.463
We've determined they're agents

12:22.464 --> 12:24.503
of the Saudi Arabian government.

12:24.504 --> 12:27.423
Which, it turns out, is where
the girls are being held.

12:27.424 --> 12:30.543
They never made it to Libya?

12:30.544 --> 12:32.494
No, ma'am.

12:34.544 --> 12:37.093
And the Saudis took two of our citizens

12:37.094 --> 12:39.503
without ever bothering to tell us,

12:39.504 --> 12:41.503
even with wall-to-wall
news coverage about it?

12:41.504 --> 12:44.793
The only answer we've been able to get
from the Saudi Arabian government

12:44.794 --> 12:46.673
is that their intelligence indicates

12:46.674 --> 12:50.043
the girls were gonna be used
in a plot against Saudi Arabia.

12:50.044 --> 12:52.883
Wait a minute, that doesn't...

12:52.884 --> 12:55.293
that doesn't make any sense.

12:55.294 --> 12:57.713
Why would Hizb Al-Shahid

12:57.714 --> 12:59.833
plot a strike against Saudi Arabia

12:59.834 --> 13:02.543
(chuckles): when it's basically
an open secret that Saudi Arabia

13:02.544 --> 13:04.673
is where the group gets
most of its money?

13:04.674 --> 13:07.046
- We've never been able to prove that.
- I know.

13:07.047 --> 13:10.633
But if we could, I might have leverage

13:10.634 --> 13:13.253
to find out what the Saudis are hiding.

13:13.254 --> 13:14.923
(deep sigh)

13:14.924 --> 13:17.423
Without it, it's just a
bunch of puzzle pieces

13:17.424 --> 13:19.793
that don't... really fit.

13:19.794 --> 13:22.383
You can see why it seemed
above my pay grade.

13:22.384 --> 13:24.093
Yeah.

13:24.094 --> 13:26.753
I hope it's appropriate
that I came to you.

13:26.755 --> 13:27.714
Of <i>course.</i>

13:27.715 --> 13:30.914
I wish more of us reached out.

13:32.174 --> 13:36.954
You think it's a departmental
thing or a guy thing?

13:38.754 --> 13:42.173
That's okay. Don't answer that.

13:42.174 --> 13:43.833
Will you excuse me just...

13:43.834 --> 13:45.673
for one minute? I'll be right back.

13:45.675 --> 13:46.964
Blake.

13:46.965 --> 13:48.634
Already calling Henry, ma'am.

13:48.635 --> 13:50.674
Oh. And listen,

13:50.675 --> 13:52.634
that meeting with the,
uh, Saudi ambassador

13:52.635 --> 13:54.884
is now officially urgent...
no more phone call.

13:54.885 --> 13:56.995
- I want him in my office.
- Of course.

13:58.335 --> 14:06.229

It's okay, you can tell me.

14:21.280 --> 14:23.276
Yeah, they're happy to get <i>you.</i>

14:23.277 --> 14:25.566

14:28.397 --> 14:30.736

14:30.737 --> 14:31.986
By not engaging.

14:31.987 --> 14:34.816
By being <i>just </i> unavailable enough

14:34.817 --> 14:37.227
that it's like total catnip.

14:39.898 --> 14:41.106
I bet, I bet.

14:41.107 --> 14:43.026
So, how was it?

14:43.027 --> 14:45.066
She's doing great.
Her math scores are up.

14:45.067 --> 14:46.067
She's even eligible for

14:46.068 --> 14:47.816
an AP calculus course next semester.

14:47.817 --> 14:48.856
Uh-huh.

14:48.857 --> 14:51.236
S.A.T. prep is going well.

14:51.237 --> 14:52.566
And...?

14:52.567 --> 14:54.026
(sighs deeply)

14:54.027 --> 14:56.566
There's a social thing.

14:56.567 --> 14:58.776
This girl's getting bullied online.

14:58.777 --> 15:00.936
They suspended the kids
who put up the Web site,

15:00.937 --> 15:02.646
but they're notifying
the parents of everybody

15:02.647 --> 15:04.149
- who posted on it.
- She didn't.

15:04.150 --> 15:05.937
Yeah.

15:07.147 --> 15:10.347
"Ella Barnes is style free."

15:11.487 --> 15:14.316
Well, I don't know if I'm disgusted

15:14.317 --> 15:16.936
because she participated in it, or...

15:16.937 --> 15:19.276
relieved that this is
the worst she could do.

15:19.277 --> 15:20.337
I was pretty disgusted.

15:20.338 --> 15:21.396
Yeah.

15:21.397 --> 15:22.896
There was a big talk at school

15:22.897 --> 15:24.896
about their letting
the parents deal with it

15:24.897 --> 15:26.316
however we choose.

15:26.317 --> 15:28.646
Well, I-I say...

15:28.647 --> 15:30.896
no screens for a month.

15:30.897 --> 15:33.436
Or, you know what, we'll just
take the phone away entirely.

15:33.437 --> 15:36.566
I mean, this is...
this is total mean girl crap,

15:36.567 --> 15:37.989
- and I hate it.
- (phone buzzing)

15:37.990 --> 15:40.066
Yeah. But I don't just want punishment.

15:40.067 --> 15:42.436
I mean, I... I want to talk to her.

15:42.437 --> 15:44.526
I want her to do some soul-searching.

15:44.527 --> 15:48.646
Yes. Full religion professor... go.

15:48.647 --> 15:50.276
Jay's here.

15:50.277 --> 15:51.147
Jay's here?

15:51.148 --> 15:53.517
(whispers): With his baby.

15:54.357 --> 15:55.856
Hey, Jay. Come on in.

15:55.857 --> 15:57.107
Thank you...

15:57.108 --> 15:55.856
Oh...

15:55.857 --> 15:58.356
Oh, wow!

15:58.357 --> 15:59.647
Look how big!

15:59.648 --> 16:00.936
I'm so sorry to just show up,

16:00.937 --> 16:02.936
but driving's the only thing
that makes her sleep, and...

16:02.937 --> 16:04.236
Are you driving your daddy crazy?

16:04.237 --> 16:06.026
I'm so sick of driving
around the block.

16:06.027 --> 16:08.276
(chuckles): Oh, are you kidding?
We're so glad to see you.

16:08.277 --> 16:09.989
- And now the driving's not even working.
- Hi.

16:09.990 --> 16:11.359
- Okay, here, let me just try.
- You sure?

16:11.360 --> 16:13.279
- Yeah. Ah. - Thank you.
- Yeah.

16:13.280 --> 16:14.696
Oh. Right.

16:14.697 --> 16:17.236
No females can resist his charms.

16:17.237 --> 16:19.356
HENRY: I heard that.

16:19.357 --> 16:21.356
Bet you don't miss having babies.

16:21.357 --> 16:23.736
Tonight I might. Long story.

16:23.737 --> 16:27.026
I'd offer you a glass of wine,
but since you're driving...

16:27.027 --> 16:29.276
Water? Juice?

16:29.277 --> 16:32.396
Not juice. Not juice.

16:32.397 --> 16:34.396
You know, in about six months,

16:34.397 --> 16:36.316
she'll be sleeping through the night,

16:36.317 --> 16:39.196
and you'll actually
look back on this time...

16:39.197 --> 16:40.842
with nostalgia.

16:40.843 --> 16:42.486
(chuckles)

16:42.487 --> 16:44.436
Thanks.

16:44.437 --> 16:47.646
It might be about more
than just the baby.

16:47.647 --> 16:49.649
- (turns on faucet)
- Yeah, I kind of thought so.

16:49.650 --> 16:51.196
(turns faucet off)

16:51.197 --> 16:52.606
Stolen nukes

16:52.607 --> 16:54.196
got in your head?

16:54.197 --> 16:55.437
A little.

16:58.197 --> 17:00.026
Maybe a lot.

17:00.027 --> 17:02.026
That inspector from the plant...

17:02.027 --> 17:03.646
why was he in the truck?

17:03.647 --> 17:05.736
To advise on proper disposal?

17:05.737 --> 17:08.356
All the other disposal runs
took place during the day.

17:08.357 --> 17:10.195
This was the only one at night.

17:10.196 --> 17:13.146
The thieves shot the
driver point-blank.

17:13.146 --> 17:16.236
But this inspector...
there's no trace of him.

17:16.237 --> 17:17.316
Kidnapped?

17:17.317 --> 17:19.276
Thought of that.
But then I went digging

17:19.277 --> 17:21.276
in all the files...

17:21.277 --> 17:24.066
from the nuclear plant, and...

17:24.067 --> 17:25.276
found this.

17:25.277 --> 17:27.486
Uh... sorry.

17:27.487 --> 17:30.236
It got... drooled on a little.

17:30.237 --> 17:32.356
It's a report to replace

17:32.357 --> 17:34.146
the power plant's security supervisor,

17:34.147 --> 17:36.396
dated two weeks before the heist.

17:36.397 --> 17:38.316
And who ordered the rehire?

17:38.317 --> 17:39.856
The inspector.

17:39.857 --> 17:43.316
So you think that the inspector
wanted to hire his own...

17:43.317 --> 17:46.196
security guy who'd...
look the other way?

17:46.197 --> 17:48.937
Yeah. I think he was in on it.

17:50.487 --> 17:52.896
DNI, CIA, they...

17:52.897 --> 17:58.106
they think terrorists don't
want to bother with nukes

17:58.107 --> 18:01.196
because it's too much trouble.

18:01.197 --> 18:04.276
But if the uranium comes
with its own nuclear physicist

18:04.277 --> 18:06.196
to show them how to use it?

18:06.197 --> 18:09.517
I'd call that getting the
most bang for your buck.

18:11.277 --> 18:13.436
Looks like I've still got it.

18:13.437 --> 18:14.736
(laughs softly)

18:14.737 --> 18:17.847
At least one of us is
gonna get some sleep.

18:18.697 --> 18:20.566
(whispers): Oh, look...

18:20.567 --> 18:23.187
(sighs): Yeah. Yeah.

18:23.987 --> 18:25.896
Huh. You are definitely

18:25.897 --> 18:27.146
onto something.

18:27.147 --> 18:28.856
I was hoping you wouldn't say that.

18:28.857 --> 18:30.276
You know, we had a researcher

18:30.277 --> 18:32.316
at the same nuclear plant in Moldova

18:32.317 --> 18:34.816
targeted by a local crime boss...

18:34.817 --> 18:37.307
Ion Gurian.

18:38.527 --> 18:41.196
The researcher refused to sell Gurian

18:41.197 --> 18:44.436
some radiological detection devices

18:44.437 --> 18:47.316
so his goons could scrape
out all the cesium

18:47.317 --> 18:50.687
and do... God knows what with it.

18:51.737 --> 18:54.606
A few days after his refusal,
the researcher started...

18:54.607 --> 18:58.696
getting death threats,
so we had to grant him asylum,

18:58.697 --> 19:02.486
and now... he teaches at MIT.

19:02.487 --> 19:05.526
It's another report
I sent upstairs. I...

19:05.527 --> 19:07.896
So we should find this inspector

19:07.897 --> 19:10.646
who clearly gave them what
they wanted <i>this</i> time.

19:10.647 --> 19:13.606
No. The inspector's... in the wind.

19:13.607 --> 19:15.936
You want to focus on Gurian.

19:15.937 --> 19:18.436
Get eyes on all his usual haunts.

19:18.437 --> 19:21.276
Wait for him to try
to sell, get a team in,

19:21.277 --> 19:23.609
- and trap him.
- Shouldn't we check out the power plant?

19:23.610 --> 19:25.736
Look for other leaks in the staff?

19:25.737 --> 19:28.229
(chuckles) If... if you
want to waste resources

19:28.229 --> 19:30.356
tailing some mid-level dupes,
go right ahead,

19:30.357 --> 19:33.566
but I am telling you where
you're going to get a hit.

19:33.567 --> 19:34.816
Well, how do...

19:34.817 --> 19:36.526
(chuckles): Walter...

19:36.527 --> 19:38.727
you don't actually know that.

19:40.197 --> 19:42.936
Did you ever read <i>The Odyssey, </i> Jay?

19:42.937 --> 19:45.436
(sighs, laughs wryly)

19:45.437 --> 19:47.236
Of course.

19:47.237 --> 19:49.986
Yes, I-I, I mean, you know, it's...

19:49.987 --> 19:51.936
it's been a while.

19:51.937 --> 19:54.606
So, Odysseus comes home...

19:54.607 --> 19:57.356
after the war... it's been 20 years...

19:57.357 --> 19:59.356
but he wants to surprise all the suitors

19:59.357 --> 20:01.316
who have been trying to steal his wife,

20:01.317 --> 20:03.486
so he's dressed like a beggar.

20:03.487 --> 20:06.526
And no one recognized him and he
slaughtered all of the suitors.

20:06.527 --> 20:09.727
Nah-nah-nah... someone
<i>does </i> recognize him.

20:10.607 --> 20:13.026
His dog... Argos.

20:13.027 --> 20:16.276
He's been put out on the
dung heap, covered in fleas,

20:16.277 --> 20:19.276
on the brink of death, but
as his master passes by,

20:19.277 --> 20:22.566
Argos looks up, wags his tail...

20:22.567 --> 20:25.526
and, having seen his
master one more time,

20:25.527 --> 20:27.097
he dies.

20:27.937 --> 20:29.566
Argos knew.

20:29.567 --> 20:31.477
How did he know?

20:32.317 --> 20:35.316
He looked past all the noise

20:35.317 --> 20:37.347
to the truth.

20:38.737 --> 20:40.397
Mm-hmm.

20:44.817 --> 20:47.696
I'd still like to put some
surveillance on the plant.

20:47.697 --> 20:49.606
Belt and suspenders.

20:49.607 --> 20:51.646
Yeah, I... I get it.

20:51.647 --> 20:53.066
You're scared.

20:53.067 --> 20:55.606
You think you can stop it
if you plug up every hole,

20:55.607 --> 20:57.356
but you can't stop it, Jay.

20:57.357 --> 20:58.606
This stuff is everywhere.

20:58.607 --> 20:59.936
It's not if, it's when.

20:59.937 --> 21:01.526
So all we can do

21:01.527 --> 21:03.606
is try to look past all the noise,

21:03.607 --> 21:06.396
all the fear, plug up
the biggest hole today,

21:06.397 --> 21:09.696
and <i>maybe... </i> keep it
from happening tomorrow.

21:09.697 --> 21:11.437
That's it.

21:14.777 --> 21:16.236
(sighs)

21:16.237 --> 21:18.606
(chuckles)

21:18.607 --> 21:20.486
I know, I know... (clears throat)

21:20.487 --> 21:22.687
back to my dung heap.

21:26.937 --> 21:28.817
I'm doing a column on
homemade spa treatments...

21:28.818 --> 21:29.936
can it wait?

21:29.937 --> 21:31.767
No, not really.

21:33.607 --> 21:34.736
Oh.

21:34.737 --> 21:37.486
You didn't think it was
important to mention that?

21:37.487 --> 21:40.526
(sighs): No. Because I
didn't actually post it.

21:40.527 --> 21:42.696
Stacy Henworth thought
it would be hilarious...

21:42.697 --> 21:46.727
since fashion is my thing...
she posted it in my name.

21:48.357 --> 21:51.486
I know that sounds lame,
but it's the truth.

21:51.487 --> 21:54.106
So you knew she did this in your name,

21:54.107 --> 21:55.936
you did nothing to refute it,

21:55.937 --> 21:58.276
but you still think
you're not culpable?

21:58.277 --> 22:00.356
Not totally.

22:00.357 --> 22:02.196
Hm. Okay.

22:02.197 --> 22:04.736
If that's the way you
want to look at it.

22:04.737 --> 22:06.736
I'm disappointed,
but I appreciate your honesty.

22:06.737 --> 22:08.847
What was I supposed to do?

22:12.237 --> 22:15.017
That's a good question.

22:20.697 --> 22:21.527
There you are.

22:21.528 --> 22:22.816
Good morning, Madam Secretary.

22:22.817 --> 22:25.606
Does it mean that
it's any... less urgent

22:25.607 --> 22:28.696
if you don't lie in
wait at the elevator?

22:28.697 --> 22:31.526
Or are you just trying
to keep me guessing?

22:31.527 --> 22:32.797
You'll never know.

22:32.798 --> 22:34.066
(laughs)

22:34.067 --> 22:37.566
This is the report from
Jay and the ISN Bureau.

22:37.567 --> 22:40.106
The nuclear material was
detected in a warehouse

22:40.107 --> 22:42.356
outside of Chisinau in Moldova.

22:42.357 --> 22:45.106
CIA is tracking it for a possible sale.

22:45.107 --> 22:47.066
Wow. Coordination between departments.

22:47.067 --> 22:49.106
It's enough to warm my heart.

22:49.107 --> 22:50.696
Despite the, you know,

22:50.697 --> 22:53.856
deadly material possibly
being sold to nefarious agents.

22:53.857 --> 22:54.817
Hi.

22:54.818 --> 22:56.777
Good morning, ma'am.
Prince Asim of Saudi Arabia

22:56.778 --> 22:58.107
is waiting in the conference room.

22:58.108 --> 23:00.067
And Marguerite Sanchez
from the FBI is waiting

23:00.068 --> 23:02.650
- in your office.
- Marguerite is back? Did she say why?

23:02.651 --> 23:05.147
She didn't choose to
share that with me, no.

23:05.148 --> 23:07.107
I suggest we prioritize Prince Asim.

23:07.108 --> 23:09.527
And, just to reiterate our strategy

23:09.528 --> 23:10.940
- with the ambassador...
- I know.

23:10.941 --> 23:12.937
Stick to the education conference,

23:12.938 --> 23:16.147
don't wreck the arms deal,
but do find out everything I can

23:16.148 --> 23:17.737
about the two Ohio girls

23:17.738 --> 23:19.820
- that they have in their custody.
- Being careful to avoid

23:19.821 --> 23:21.397
any intimations of wrongdoing

23:21.398 --> 23:23.237
on the part of Saudi Arabia.

23:23.238 --> 23:24.487
Message received.

23:24.488 --> 23:25.987
No claws.

23:25.988 --> 23:28.527
Will you, uh, tell Marguerite
that I will be with her

23:28.528 --> 23:30.317
as soon as I finish up
with the prince, okay?

23:30.318 --> 23:32.147
Yes, ma'am.

23:32.148 --> 23:35.308
I think you're going to
want to talk to me first.

23:44.972 --> 23:48.816
Prince Asim, I am so sorry
to keep you waiting.

23:48.817 --> 23:50.430
It's not a problem, Madam Secretary.

23:50.431 --> 23:51.959
I'm sure you're greatly occupied

23:51.960 --> 23:54.408
with preparations for the
education conference.

23:54.409 --> 23:56.038
Yes, we're really looking forward

23:56.039 --> 23:58.118
to Noura Al-Kitabi's address tomorrow.

23:58.119 --> 24:01.198
Which I will be viewing remotely.

24:01.199 --> 24:02.698
We're grateful for your cooperation.

24:02.699 --> 24:04.581
- I hope you understand.
- Of course.

24:04.582 --> 24:07.118
As you know, our long alliance
with the royal family

24:07.119 --> 24:10.538
is one we highly value.

24:10.539 --> 24:13.118
I did wonder, though,

24:13.119 --> 24:16.248
as our long-term ally,

24:16.249 --> 24:19.288
why it never came up
that two of our citizens

24:19.289 --> 24:21.908
were being held in your custody?

24:21.909 --> 24:24.788
I assume you're referring
to the Sudanese sisters.

24:24.789 --> 24:27.248
Perhaps when they joined an
international terrorist group

24:27.249 --> 24:28.748
targeting Saudi Arabia,

24:28.749 --> 24:30.945
they forfeited their right
to protection from a country

24:30.945 --> 24:32.780
they willingly abandoned.

24:32.780 --> 24:36.498
The Omer sisters were born in Ohio,

24:36.499 --> 24:40.198
so their U.S. citizenship isn't
really open to interpretation.

24:40.199 --> 24:42.538
What is, though, is whether
or not they were involved

24:42.539 --> 24:44.698
in a plot against your country.

24:44.699 --> 24:47.788
Because, well, our intelligence reveals

24:47.789 --> 24:49.118
nothing of the kind.

24:49.119 --> 24:51.158
It may be possible that
American intelligence

24:51.159 --> 24:53.118
doesn't know everything,

24:53.119 --> 24:54.581
- Madam Secretary.
- (laughs)

24:54.582 --> 24:57.038
That is true. That's true.

24:57.039 --> 24:59.498
Our intelligence did uncover,

24:59.499 --> 25:03.538
however, several verified documents

25:03.539 --> 25:06.408
detailing the transfer of funds

25:06.409 --> 25:10.328
indirectly from 12 Saudi citizens

25:10.329 --> 25:15.158
to the international terrorist
group Hizb Al-Shahid.

25:15.159 --> 25:17.503
Damning evidence, no doubt.

25:17.504 --> 25:20.368
And surely something that
your country wouldn't want

25:20.369 --> 25:23.458
the United States, your longtime ally,

25:23.459 --> 25:27.908
best oil customer and primary
arms dealer, to know about.

25:27.909 --> 25:30.698
Secretary McCord,

25:30.699 --> 25:33.498
you need to be careful
about what you're implying.

25:33.499 --> 25:37.958
Well, then let's not talk
in implications, Prince.

25:37.959 --> 25:41.319
Let's be open with each other,
as friends should be.

25:43.289 --> 25:47.198
I think that your
country is scrambling.

25:47.199 --> 25:49.868
I think the royal family
has turned a blind eye

25:49.869 --> 25:53.288
to your citizens' support
of terrorism in the past,

25:53.289 --> 25:57.248
only this time actual U.S.
citizens are joining the ranks,

25:57.249 --> 26:02.288
and rather than take the risk
of letting them come home

26:02.289 --> 26:04.748
where they might reveal
who supports their group,

26:04.749 --> 26:06.538
you're holding on to them.

26:06.539 --> 26:09.288
Maybe until this arms deal is done,

26:09.289 --> 26:11.788
or maybe indefinitely, I don't know.

26:11.789 --> 26:14.578
My guess is you guys haven't
figured out that part.

26:14.579 --> 26:17.908
That is a great deal of speculation.

26:17.909 --> 26:20.288
It is.

26:20.289 --> 26:23.158
I hope I've been clear on one point:

26:23.159 --> 26:26.319
We'd like our citizens back.

26:29.829 --> 26:32.328
I will take up the matter
with my superiors.

26:32.329 --> 26:34.288
Thank you so much, Prince.

26:34.289 --> 26:36.158
Thanks for coming in.
I really appreciate it.

26:36.159 --> 26:37.698
I assume our arms deal

26:37.699 --> 26:39.198
is in no way impacted
by this conversation.

26:39.199 --> 26:42.109
Not in the slightest.

26:49.459 --> 26:52.449
Uh, let me show you out,
Mr. Ambassador.

26:55.687 --> 26:57.644
Might have used my claws...

26:57.644 --> 26:59.269
a little.

26:59.270 --> 27:00.055
Ah.

27:00.081 --> 27:02.411
Looks like we got a possible
buyer for the nukes in Moldova.

27:02.412 --> 27:05.078
CIA has a team about to move in.

27:05.079 --> 27:06.868
Circle back to you on this?

27:06.869 --> 27:08.288
WALTER: <i>The buyer is some middleman.</i>

27:08.289 --> 27:10.185
We don't know yet who he's working for.

27:10.185 --> 27:12.086
Hopefully we can stop the
sale before it gets that far.

27:12.087 --> 27:15.643
How did we know to
watch this warehouse?

27:16.249 --> 27:18.788
(chuckles) Lucky guess.

27:18.789 --> 27:20.958
Don't be so modest.

27:20.959 --> 27:23.748
It was half instinct and half science.

27:23.749 --> 27:26.618
See? She gets it.

27:26.619 --> 27:27.698
That's why she's the boss.

27:27.699 --> 27:29.284
Hmm.

27:29.285 --> 27:30.868
(doors closing)

27:30.869 --> 27:32.698
Ah. (chuckles)

27:32.699 --> 27:34.458
Yes, yes.

27:34.459 --> 27:36.819
Back to the first floor for me.

27:38.119 --> 27:41.118
I had Blake send down
some cups for you guys.

27:41.119 --> 27:42.458
Real ones.

27:42.459 --> 27:44.658
Oh.

27:44.659 --> 27:47.828
Now, if you want to give us a gift...

27:47.829 --> 27:50.899
read our reports.

27:54.079 --> 27:55.828
DALTON: You're just in time.

27:55.829 --> 27:57.788
They're moving in on the exchange

27:57.789 --> 27:59.158
of the nuclear material.

27:59.159 --> 28:00.408
JAY: Any Intel on the buyer?

28:00.409 --> 28:01.788
Vitalie Morescu.

28:01.789 --> 28:02.908
We still don't know who sent him.

28:02.909 --> 28:04.748
He has affiliations
with multiple groups.

28:04.749 --> 28:07.779
JACKSON: A Moldovan gadfly...
that's just what we need.

28:11.869 --> 28:15.578
(silenced gunshots)

28:15.579 --> 28:17.078
SPECIAL OPS TEAM LEADER:
Entry Point One clear.

28:17.079 --> 28:18.609
Team moving in.

28:23.869 --> 28:26.069
(door opening)

28:37.539 --> 28:39.118
What's the holdup?

28:39.119 --> 28:40.698
TEAM LEADER: No access.

28:40.699 --> 28:42.449
Team retreating for Entry Point Two.

28:43.289 --> 28:45.198
Why is there no access?

28:45.199 --> 28:47.118
I don't know, sir, our floor
plan indicated a doorway.

28:47.119 --> 28:48.958
It must've been closed up.

28:48.959 --> 28:50.788
There's another point of entry.

28:50.789 --> 28:53.449
Yeah, if their cover hasn't been blown.

28:54.329 --> 28:55.538
(shouting, gunfire)

28:55.539 --> 28:56.868
SPECIAL OPS MEMBER:
I've got contact right.

28:56.869 --> 28:57.958
Rooster, pull front security.

28:57.959 --> 28:59.368
Rooster down!

28:59.369 --> 29:01.578
SPECIAL OPS MEMBER:
Enemies in front, Divot down.

29:01.579 --> 29:03.868
TEAM MEMBER: Rooster down!

29:03.869 --> 29:04.869
Charley and Whiskey down!

29:04.870 --> 29:05.998
Charley's hit.

29:05.999 --> 29:08.199
(gunfire)

29:15.320 --> 29:18.297
SPECIAL OPS TEAM LEADER: Dark
Horse HQ, we have Divot 4 Charley

29:18.297 --> 29:19.713
and Rooster 5 Whiskey down.

29:19.714 --> 29:21.564
We need evac.

29:22.323 --> 29:23.652
The floor plan was the best Intel

29:23.653 --> 29:25.322
we could get, Mr. President.

29:25.323 --> 29:26.732
I'll look into it with the commander.

29:26.733 --> 29:28.442
You're the director, Ellerman.

29:28.443 --> 29:30.523
It's on you.

29:31.733 --> 29:33.822
Tell me we at least got the uranium.

29:33.823 --> 29:35.732
TEAM LEADER: Buyer has vacated.

29:35.733 --> 29:37.652
We have members searching
the perimeter, no sign.

29:37.653 --> 29:40.232
Package is secure.

29:40.233 --> 29:42.959
We'll have full Intel tracking
that buyer, Mr. President.

29:42.960 --> 29:45.148
That buyer has gone underground now.

29:45.149 --> 29:47.317
Along with whoever sent him.

29:47.319 --> 29:49.269
At least they didn't get the uranium.

29:52.939 --> 29:55.139
Not today.

29:56.149 --> 29:57.188
HENRY: <i>Kids, I got food.</i>

29:57.189 --> 29:59.148
Ooh!

29:59.149 --> 30:02.068
Eh, uh, those dumplings are for Mom.

30:02.069 --> 30:04.148
I have got to get her eating better.

30:04.149 --> 30:05.988
What's wrong with dumplings?

30:05.989 --> 30:07.528
I mean, you got your ground-up pig meat

30:07.529 --> 30:09.858
perfectly packaged into
a little envelope of starch.

30:09.859 --> 30:11.108
It's like the ideal food unit.

30:11.109 --> 30:13.148
Could you not say "pig meat" please?

30:13.149 --> 30:15.148
Why is she working late?

30:15.149 --> 30:17.108
Because it's a regular weeknight?

30:17.109 --> 30:19.108
HENRY: Hey, Mom's job
has a lot of perks, too.

30:19.109 --> 30:22.249
Box seats to The Wizards
is not my idea of a perk.

30:22.249 --> 30:24.488
Okay, how about a personal
meeting with Noura Al-Kitabi

30:24.489 --> 30:26.148
after the conference tomorrow?

30:26.149 --> 30:27.151
- Are you serious?
- Yep.

30:27.152 --> 30:28.528
What? Dad, that's amazing.

30:28.529 --> 30:30.571
- JASON: Oh, sure. Yeah.
- I actually have a math study group,

30:30.572 --> 30:32.349
so I can't go.

30:33.899 --> 30:37.228
Hey, maybe you could skip study group.

30:37.229 --> 30:38.944
You guys are always
after me about math,

30:38.944 --> 30:40.727
and now, all of a sudden,
you want me to drop it?

30:40.728 --> 30:42.270
I just meant you could skip a session,

30:42.271 --> 30:43.656
so we can meet an amazing human being.

30:43.657 --> 30:45.027
Maybe I'm just not up for it.

30:45.867 --> 30:47.406
Okay.

30:47.407 --> 30:49.036
We'll miss you.

30:49.037 --> 30:51.446
I know you're mad at me for not
standing up for that girl.

30:51.447 --> 30:53.696
I'm not mad at you.

30:53.697 --> 30:55.450
No, it's worse... it's like
you're just done with me.

30:55.450 --> 30:56.696
Hey. Hey.

30:56.697 --> 30:57.946
No, it's fine.

30:57.947 --> 30:59.656
I don't deserve to worship at the feet

30:59.657 --> 31:00.826
of some living saint, anyways,

31:00.827 --> 31:03.711
since I'm obviously a
weakling with zero character.

31:03.711 --> 31:05.500
Come on, Ali, I never said that.

31:05.501 --> 31:07.499
I should have stopped them,
I know that,

31:07.500 --> 31:09.039
but all I did was laugh

31:09.040 --> 31:12.249
because I wanted them to like me.

31:12.250 --> 31:14.959
God, that girl stood up to
the Saudi Arabian government

31:14.960 --> 31:18.039
and I can't even stand
up to Stacy Henworth?

31:18.040 --> 31:19.619
I'm the worst.

31:19.620 --> 31:22.320
Okay, you're far from the worst.

31:23.710 --> 31:26.619
But you did give in
to fear and weakness

31:26.620 --> 31:29.039
and that's how most of the worst stuff

31:29.040 --> 31:32.030
that human beings do to each
other is allowed to happen.

31:32.880 --> 31:34.619
But here's the thing:

31:34.620 --> 31:36.709
We all do it. I've done it.

31:36.710 --> 31:38.672
- No, you haven't.
- You-you think there haven't been times

31:38.673 --> 31:39.959
when I wish I'd said something,

31:39.960 --> 31:41.709
or did something to stop something,

31:41.710 --> 31:44.499
when I knew it was wrong?

31:44.500 --> 31:46.249
That's why we need heroes.

31:46.250 --> 31:48.249
They inspire us,
so that maybe next time,

31:48.250 --> 31:50.910
we dig a little deeper
to find our best self.

31:51.750 --> 31:54.160
Even if it feels risky.

31:57.460 --> 31:59.700
I just want you to be proud of me.

32:01.290 --> 32:03.289
I am.

32:03.290 --> 32:06.030
I want you to be proud of yourself.

32:10.120 --> 32:12.410
Can I have one of Mom's dumplings?

32:13.330 --> 32:15.910
No. (chuckles)

32:19.380 --> 32:21.530
ELIZABETH (exhausted): <i>How's Ali?</i>

32:22.620 --> 32:25.619
She's a flawed mortal
fumbling towards enlightenment.

32:25.620 --> 32:27.209
Mm.

32:27.210 --> 32:28.490
Aren't we all.

32:32.790 --> 32:35.209
And I'm being unavailable

32:35.210 --> 32:38.660
in a way that's totally
irresistible, right?

32:42.830 --> 32:45.240
(slow, steady breathing)

32:51.120 --> 32:52.120
What's the emergency?

32:52.121 --> 32:53.379
Nothing.

32:53.380 --> 32:56.580
Then why are you doing
the elevator ambush?

32:57.420 --> 32:58.619
Force of habit.

32:58.620 --> 33:00.280
(elevator bell dings)

33:05.040 --> 33:07.419
Good morning, Madam Secretary.

33:07.420 --> 33:08.789
Morning.

33:08.790 --> 33:12.499
I know you saw that the Omer sisters

33:12.500 --> 33:14.749
were returned from
Saudi Arabia last night.

33:14.750 --> 33:17.789
Yeah, and all it took was a
diplomatic boxing match.

33:17.790 --> 33:19.829
I have the full revised itinerary

33:19.830 --> 33:21.709
for the Worldwide
Partnership for Girls'

33:21.710 --> 33:24.459
and Women's Education
conference this afternoon.

33:24.460 --> 33:26.539
We're setting up a remote
feed in your office.

33:26.540 --> 33:28.499
Hate that, but thank you.

33:28.500 --> 33:30.329
Marguerite Sanchez from the
FBI is in your office.

33:30.330 --> 33:32.169
She never wants to tell
me why she's here,

33:32.170 --> 33:33.919
which I'm trying not
to take personally.

33:33.920 --> 33:36.120
Good. Don't.

33:37.120 --> 33:39.450
Oh, I just came along for the ride.

33:42.250 --> 33:44.030
Oy.

33:46.540 --> 33:48.209
Marguerite.

33:48.210 --> 33:51.789
I see you're taking me at my
word to reach out more often.

33:51.790 --> 33:53.879
Sorry to bother you, Madam Secretary.

33:53.880 --> 33:57.039
It's no bother, I promise.
I'm very glad

33:57.040 --> 34:00.879
we got such fast results getting
the Omer girls back home.

34:00.880 --> 34:02.499
We did, and thank you.

34:02.500 --> 34:05.169
I wanted to tell you personally

34:05.170 --> 34:07.789
that it turns out Hizb
Al-Shahid was, in fact,

34:07.790 --> 34:10.039
planning an attack on Saudi Arabia.

34:10.040 --> 34:11.879
Ah. So...

34:11.880 --> 34:13.820
in other words, I was wrong.

34:15.330 --> 34:17.539
Oh, no, believe me,
it happens all the time.

34:17.540 --> 34:19.918
You can ask my staff.

34:19.920 --> 34:21.619
What was the target? Did you find out?

34:21.620 --> 34:22.998
That's why I'm here.

34:23.000 --> 34:25.748
One of the sisters admitted
under interrogation

34:25.750 --> 34:28.789
that she was assigned to visit
the home of Noura Al-Kitabi,

34:28.790 --> 34:31.958
gain access as an admirer
of their daughter

34:31.960 --> 34:34.379
and then detonate herself,

34:34.380 --> 34:37.708
taking as many of the family
members with her as she could.

34:37.710 --> 34:38.958
Oh.

34:38.960 --> 34:40.998
We're adding additional security.

34:41.000 --> 34:43.039
We've alerted the family
as well as the Saudis,

34:43.040 --> 34:44.829
but I know that Noura

34:44.830 --> 34:47.039
is your guest speaker this afternoon.

34:47.040 --> 34:49.780
I thought you might want
to tell her yourself.

34:51.500 --> 34:54.039
Thank you for coming to tell me,
Madam Secretary.

34:54.040 --> 34:55.789
I completely understand

34:55.790 --> 34:57.999
if you want to cancel
your appearance today.

34:58.000 --> 34:59.709
Uh, we're prepared to do that.

34:59.710 --> 35:02.289
I don't want you to do anything
that you feel might put

35:02.290 --> 35:03.959
your family at greater risk.

35:03.960 --> 35:06.209
My family has raised me
to demand my rights

35:06.210 --> 35:07.619
as a full human being.

35:07.620 --> 35:09.959
That is why we have been at
risk from the very beginning.

35:09.960 --> 35:13.249
(speaks Arabic)

35:13.250 --> 35:14.539
I understand.

35:14.540 --> 35:16.919
I look forward to seeing
you at the conference.

35:16.920 --> 35:19.289
Unfortunately, Noura,

35:19.290 --> 35:21.530
I-I won't be able to be there.

35:23.080 --> 35:24.579
Of course.

35:24.580 --> 35:26.249
I understand. You're very busy.

35:26.250 --> 35:28.709
(speaks Arabic) Sorry,

35:28.710 --> 35:32.619
I just got on Twitter, but
my mother can't see this.

35:32.620 --> 35:36.370
Well, do your mother
a favor and just...

35:37.330 --> 35:39.329
...stay off of Snapchat.

35:39.330 --> 35:43.780
That's where I officially lost control.

35:44.830 --> 35:47.879
Don't worry, Madam Secretary.

35:47.880 --> 35:49.579
Like my father says,

35:49.580 --> 35:52.160
everything will be as Allah wills it.

36:08.686 --> 36:10.319
BLAKE: I think you want the auxiliary...

36:10.320 --> 36:12.072
- AUX...
- I-I know what AUX means.

36:12.073 --> 36:15.319
Oh. Sorry, forgot who you were dating.

36:15.320 --> 36:17.239
I just made this worse
for myself, aren't I?

36:17.240 --> 36:18.822
- Yes.
- Yeah.

36:18.823 --> 36:20.819
Ah.

36:20.820 --> 36:22.489
How does it look, ma'am?

36:22.490 --> 36:24.359
(applause on TV)

36:24.360 --> 36:26.940
Like somewhere I'm supposed to be.

36:29.490 --> 36:31.739
Thank you to Segall University,

36:31.740 --> 36:33.655
(security gate beeping)

36:33.656 --> 36:35.569
to the Department of State,
and to all of you.

36:35.570 --> 36:37.649
It is a total thrill

36:37.650 --> 36:40.399
to be invited to join the
Worldwide Partnership

36:40.400 --> 36:42.779
for Girls' and Women's Education today.

36:42.780 --> 36:46.529
This is something I never
would have imagined for myself

36:46.530 --> 36:48.859
two years ago, when I gave
a speech at my school

36:48.860 --> 36:50.279
about education reform

36:50.280 --> 36:52.689
in my country. I was excited

36:52.690 --> 36:55.649
about our first coeducational
university in Riyadh,

36:55.650 --> 36:58.489
where I hoped to one day
study architecture.

36:58.490 --> 37:00.899
I wanted to work like my father.

37:00.900 --> 37:03.399
I wanted to run for a
government position.

37:03.400 --> 37:06.279
I also wanted to meet the
members of One Direction.

37:06.280 --> 37:07.859
(laughter)

37:07.860 --> 37:10.277
"Story of My Life" was my jam.

37:10.278 --> 37:12.359
Please do not judge.

37:12.360 --> 37:15.319
But when I applied for the
architecture program,

37:15.320 --> 37:18.949
I was told I could get a degree,

37:18.950 --> 37:22.416
but I could never practice
my skill until there was

37:22.416 --> 37:25.205
"a workplace clear of men."

37:25.206 --> 37:28.285
Seeing my discouragement,
my father suggested I post

37:28.286 --> 37:30.364
my speech online, calling for

37:30.365 --> 37:33.704
an end to gender segregation
in the workplace.

37:33.705 --> 37:37.114
So I did.

37:37.115 --> 37:40.324
Two days later, there was a man
waiting for me outside my home,

37:40.325 --> 37:44.115
where he threw acid at my face.

37:51.205 --> 37:53.155
(attendees murmuring)

37:59.035 --> 38:00.704
After the attack,

38:00.705 --> 38:03.457
- when I saw what I looked like, I wanted to die.
- JAY: Hey,

38:03.458 --> 38:04.583
we're watching in here?

38:04.584 --> 38:06.864
No one reads my e-mails.

38:06.865 --> 38:09.034
Sorry, I was touching base with Walter.

38:09.035 --> 38:11.114
We just got some really
weird news from Moldova.

38:11.115 --> 38:12.704
But it can wait.

38:12.705 --> 38:14.654
No. What is it?

38:14.655 --> 38:18.454
CIA tracked who was trying to
buy the uranium in the raid.

38:18.455 --> 38:20.034
It was Hizb Al-Shahid.

38:20.035 --> 38:23.244
The same group that recruited
the two American girls.

38:23.245 --> 38:24.574
Wait, what?!

38:24.575 --> 38:25.654
I know.

38:25.655 --> 38:28.025
It's a crazy coincidence, right?

38:29.575 --> 38:31.494
I don't know if that's a coincidence.

38:31.495 --> 38:32.695
What do you mean?

38:33.955 --> 38:36.244
On the one hand, you have Saudi Arabia,

38:36.245 --> 38:38.244
who does not want us to know

38:38.245 --> 38:40.914
that their citizens are
funding Hizb Al-Shahid,

38:40.915 --> 38:44.824
so... they take those girls hostage

38:44.825 --> 38:46.494
in order to cover it up.

38:46.495 --> 38:48.284
Meanwhile, in Moldova,

38:48.285 --> 38:51.704
we have a group trying to buy uranium,

38:51.705 --> 38:54.824
something no other terrorist
group has been able to do.

38:54.825 --> 38:58.324
Back in Saudi Arabia,
we learn that Hizb Al-Shahid

38:58.325 --> 39:00.994
is targeting the family of Noura

39:00.995 --> 39:03.864
Al-Kitabi, and now,

39:03.865 --> 39:05.284
you're telling me
that that's the same group

39:05.285 --> 39:06.704
that was trying to buy the uranium?

39:06.705 --> 39:08.784
Yeah, but both situations
were contained.

39:08.785 --> 39:10.287
- What if it isn't?
- What?

39:10.288 --> 39:12.205
What if their whole point
was to put their main target

39:12.206 --> 39:16.824
right there in front us, while
we all stand back and watch?

39:16.825 --> 39:18.617
- We have to shut it down.
- What?

39:18.618 --> 39:19.704
The conference!

39:19.705 --> 39:20.824
Shut it down! Now!

39:20.825 --> 39:21.990
Blake, please call...

39:21.991 --> 39:23.154
Yeah. Yeah.

39:23.155 --> 39:24.914
Henry.

39:24.915 --> 39:28.324
NOURA (over speakers): So today
I speak for the invisible.

39:28.325 --> 39:29.784
Can I check your bag, please?

39:29.785 --> 39:31.638
NOURA: Sometimes it's hard to accept

39:31.638 --> 39:34.414
that this change won't
happen in my life.

39:34.415 --> 39:36.914
- But I know this change.
- Pat down.

39:36.915 --> 39:37.915
Is possible.

39:37.916 --> 39:39.744
Please.

39:39.745 --> 39:40.548
Right here.

39:40.573 --> 39:42.957
NOURA: Dignity begins with
a simple act of respect,

39:42.958 --> 39:46.324
like accepting that the
thirst for knowledge

39:46.325 --> 39:49.244
does not belong to one
gender or tradition,

39:49.245 --> 39:51.161
but to all of mankind.

39:51.162 --> 39:53.806
WOMAN (over P.A.): Ladies and
gentlemen, at this time,

39:53.806 --> 39:55.154
we ask all audience members

39:55.155 --> 39:58.034
to please proceed calmly
to the nearest exit.

39:58.035 --> 40:00.235
All right.

40:01.575 --> 40:03.534
Ladies and gentlemen,
the conference is now closed.

40:03.535 --> 40:05.575
There'll be no further
admittance at this time.

40:07.825 --> 40:09.556
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Please proceed calmly

40:09.556 --> 40:10.825
to the nearest exit.

40:12.495 --> 40:13.534
What's going on?

40:13.535 --> 40:15.204
This way. Now.

40:15.205 --> 40:16.205
WOMAN (over P.A.): Please stay calm

40:16.206 --> 40:17.225
and exit on both sides...

40:17.226 --> 40:18.244
I'm sorry.

40:18.245 --> 40:19.994
(people clamoring)

40:19.995 --> 40:22.065
MAN: Hurry, this way. This way.

40:25.075 --> 40:26.704
There's an exit over here!

40:26.705 --> 40:30.115
WOMAN: Excuse me, sir...

40:33.655 --> 40:35.244
(alarm beeping)

40:35.245 --> 40:36.494
(clamoring)

40:36.495 --> 40:38.255
This way, everybody.
We need to get out.

40:39.285 --> 40:42.154
<i>Allahu Akbar!</i>

40:42.155 --> 40:43.615
(people screaming)

40:47.865 --> 40:50.065
No.

40:51.995 --> 40:54.775
(distant sirens wailing)

40:55.995 --> 40:58.494
WOMAN: Dr. McCord,
I need everyone in the car.

40:58.495 --> 41:00.287
- We have to call Mom.
- We've got to get you home.

41:00.288 --> 41:01.885
We will. Come on.
Everything's gonna be okay.

41:01.910 --> 41:02.417
Dad!

41:02.418 --> 41:03.914
I'll see you at home.

41:03.915 --> 41:05.114
Everything's gonna be okay.

41:05.115 --> 41:06.204
Go! Go!

41:06.205 --> 41:09.155
(sirens wailing, engine accelerating)

41:10.035 --> 41:11.824
Matt... anything yet?

41:11.825 --> 41:13.454
Signals are all down.
We'll keep trying, ma'am.

41:13.455 --> 41:15.414
Jay is on with Head
of Security right now.

41:15.415 --> 41:17.574
I would like to know
that my family is alive

41:17.575 --> 41:19.154
before they take me to the bunker.

41:19.155 --> 41:20.454
All three kids are with security.

41:20.455 --> 41:21.994
They're fine. They're fine.

41:21.995 --> 41:23.864
They're being taken to St.
Anne's Hospital nearby.

41:23.865 --> 41:25.917
- Ma'am?
- Wait. Why are they going to a hospital

41:25.918 --> 41:26.793
if they're fine?

41:26.818 --> 41:29.417
They have to be checked
for radiation exposure.

41:29.418 --> 41:31.114
It was a dirty bomb?

41:31.115 --> 41:33.034
I need you to come with me, ma'am.

41:33.035 --> 41:34.864
What about Henry?

41:34.865 --> 41:36.704
Still locating him.

41:36.705 --> 41:39.154
Well, if the kids made it to safety,

41:39.155 --> 41:41.364
I'm sure Henry did, also.

41:41.365 --> 41:45.355
(sobbing, screaming)

41:46.415 --> 41:48.114
Listen to me, listen
to me, listen to me.

41:48.115 --> 41:50.617
- No! No! No! No!
- Hey, hey, hey, look at me, look at me.

41:50.618 --> 41:51.864
Look at me. Look at me.

41:51.865 --> 41:53.994
I got the bleeding stopped,
okay? You're okay.

41:53.996 --> 41:56.535
There's help on the way.
You're all right.

41:56.536 --> 41:58.736
(woman sobbing)
