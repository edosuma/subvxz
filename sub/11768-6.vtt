A Division of TIME WARNER
ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY, L.P.

00:13.867 --> 00:15.567
WAS IT BURNED
TO THE GROUND ?

00:15.600 --> 00:16.967
ARE YOU SURE
IT'S HIM ?

00:17.000 --> 00:18.867
YOU'RE POSITIVE.

00:18.900 --> 00:20.933
HAS HE ADMITTED
TO IT ?

00:20.967 --> 00:22.733
IT CAN'T BE
THAT BAD.

00:22.767 --> 00:25.333
LOOK, NO ONE WAS KILLED,
NO ONE WAS HURT.

00:25.367 --> 00:27.600
NO !

00:27.633 --> 00:31.033
I GOTTA CALL YOU BACK
IN A FEW MINUTES, OKAY ?

00:31.067 --> 00:32.433
I CAN'T BELIEVE
HE DID THIS.

00:32.467 --> 00:33.900
I'M VERY SORRY,
THAT'S ALL I CAN TELL YOU.

00:33.933 --> 00:34.900
BYE.

00:34.933 --> 00:37.933
WHAT'S GOING ON ?

00:37.967 --> 00:39.700
YOU KNOW, I...

00:39.733 --> 00:41.500
YOU GOT A TISSUE OR
SOMETHING AROUND HERE ?

00:41.533 --> 00:42.700
NO.

00:42.733 --> 00:43.700
OH.

00:43.733 --> 00:44.700
WHAT'S ALL
THAT ABOUT ?

00:44.733 --> 00:46.700
YOU OKAY ?

00:46.733 --> 00:47.733
YEAH, WHAT'S
GOING ON ?

00:47.767 --> 00:50.067
I SPONSORED A KID
FROM THE INNER CITY

00:50.100 --> 00:51.167
TO GO TO SUMMER CAMP.

00:51.200 --> 00:53.000
YOU SPONSORED
AN INNER CITY KID ?

00:53.033 --> 00:54.000
YEAH.

00:54.033 --> 00:55.000
YOU'RE KIDDING.

00:55.033 --> 00:56.000
NO !

00:56.033 --> 00:58.533
I'M COMPLETELY
NONPLUSSED.

00:58.567 --> 00:59.833
IS THAT
THE RIGHT WORD ?

00:59.867 --> 01:01.100
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
THE RIGHT WORD IS.

01:01.133 --> 01:03.467
I'M FLABBERGASTED,
I'LL TELL YOU WHY.

01:03.500 --> 01:05.800
HE SET FIRE,

01:05.833 --> 01:07.800
TO THE CANTEEN
AND HIS CABIN.

01:07.833 --> 01:09.067
WHO DOES THAT ?!

01:09.067 --> 01:10.067
OH, MY GOD !

01:10.067 --> 01:11.067
THAT'S INSANE.

01:11.100 --> 01:12.200
HOLY COW !

01:12.233 --> 01:13.600
WELL, THAT'S TOO BAD.

01:13.633 --> 01:15.467
YOU TRY TO DO
SOMETHING NICE,
SEE WHAT HAPPENS ?

01:15.500 --> 01:16.533
YOU GET SCREWED.

01:16.567 --> 01:18.100
YOU DO ONE NICE
THING IN YOUR LIFE.

01:18.133 --> 01:19.233
I ASSUME IT'S
THE FIRST NICE THING

01:19.267 --> 01:20.233
YOU'VE EVER DONE
IN YOUR LIFE.

01:20.267 --> 01:21.300
YOU'RE SO
COMPLIMENTARY.

01:21.333 --> 01:22.500
THAT WAS
VERY NICE OF YOU.

01:22.533 --> 01:24.267
IT WOULD PUT YOU
ONE UP ON ME, IF
THAT'S THE CASE.

01:24.300 --> 01:26.333
ALTHOUGH I DID ONCE
TRY TO STOP A WOMAN

01:26.367 --> 01:27.533
WHO WAS ABOUT TO
GET HIT BY A CAR,

01:27.567 --> 01:29.067
I SCREAMED OUT,
"WATCH OUT !",

01:29.067 --> 01:31.367
AND SHE SAID, "DON'T YOU
TELL ME WHAT TO DO !"

01:31.400 --> 01:33.767
I TRIED TO SAVE HER LIFE
AND SHE SCREAMED AT ME.

01:33.800 --> 01:35.500
AND THAT'S ALL IT TOOK
FOR YOU TO STOP HELPING PEOPLE.

01:35.533 --> 01:37.467
I GOT OUT OF THE NICE
BUSINESS AT THAT POINT.

01:37.500 --> 01:39.367
WELL, I'M OUT OF
THE NICE NOW AFTER A FIRE.

01:39.400 --> 01:42.067
MAYBE YOU DON'T
HAVE ALL THE FACTS
AND ALL THE DETAILS.

01:42.067 --> 01:43.700
I'VE GOTTA
TALK TO THE KID.

01:43.733 --> 01:46.400
YOU'LL TALK TO THE KID,
SEE WHAT THE KID HAS TO SAY.

01:46.433 --> 01:47.800
I'VE GOT TO FIND OUT.

01:47.833 --> 01:49.567
IN RETROSPECT, IT WOULD
HAVE BEEN A LOT BETTER,

01:49.600 --> 01:52.267
HAD HE BEEN A KLEPTOMANIAC
OR ANOTHER KIND OF MANIAC,

01:52.300 --> 01:53.533
RATHER THAN PYRO,
BECAUSE THAT'S...

01:53.567 --> 01:55.600
PYRO'S A BAD MANIAC.

01:55.633 --> 01:57.500
IF YOU'RE
GONNA BE A MANIAC,
PYRO IS A BAD MANIAC.

01:57.533 --> 01:58.500
NOT A GOOD MANIAC.

01:58.533 --> 02:00.200
YEAH, IT'S NOT
A GOOD MANIAC.

02:00.233 --> 02:02.733
( knocking )
LARRY, CHERYL JUST CALLED.

02:02.767 --> 02:03.733
SHE JUST WANTED ME
TO REMIND YOU

02:03.767 --> 02:04.867
TO COME HOME
EARLY TONIGHT, OKAY ?

02:04.900 --> 02:06.200
OKAY, THANK YOU.

02:06.233 --> 02:08.500
WHY YOU GOT TO
BE HOME EARLY ?

02:08.533 --> 02:11.067
WE'VE GOT THIS WIRE
IN OUR BACKYARD.

02:11.100 --> 02:13.533
AND MY WIFE IS COMPLETELY
OBSESSED WITH TAKING IT DOWN

02:13.567 --> 02:14.600
BECAUSE IT'S
RUINING THE VIEW.

02:14.633 --> 02:15.667
SO, SHE WANTS TO
BURY IT UNDERGROUND.

02:15.700 --> 02:16.967
IN ORDER TO DO THAT,

02:17.067 --> 02:19.267
WE HAVE TO GET SIGNATURES
FROM ADJACENT NEIGHBORS.

02:19.300 --> 02:20.600
FIVE HAVE SIGNED ON.

02:20.633 --> 02:23.667
ONE COUPLE WON'T SIGN IT,
THEY WANNA MEET US FIRST.

02:23.700 --> 02:25.067
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF
ANYTHING SO NUTTY ?

02:25.067 --> 02:26.067
NEVER.

02:26.067 --> 02:27.067
WHY ARE
THEY DOING THAT ?

02:27.100 --> 02:28.067
IT'S REALLY WRONG.

02:28.100 --> 02:29.167
IT'S VERY WRONG.

02:29.200 --> 02:30.700
IT'S SO, SO WRONG.

02:33.900 --> 02:34.900
HOW'S THIS ?

02:34.933 --> 02:36.267
OH, THAT'S BETTER.

02:36.300 --> 02:37.433
THAT'S MUCH BETTER.

02:37.467 --> 02:38.533
IT DOESN'T
LOOK BETTER.

02:38.567 --> 02:39.800
YES, YOU THINK
THEY'LL LIKE ME NOW

02:39.833 --> 02:41.400
IN THIS SHIRT BETTER
THAN THE OTHER SHIRT ?

02:41.433 --> 02:42.867
THEY WILL, PLEASE.

02:42.900 --> 02:44.167
PLEASE, JUST DO
THIS FOR ME, LARRY.

02:44.200 --> 02:45.300
I'M DOING IT.

02:45.333 --> 02:46.467
I'VE GOT TO
RID OF THAT WIRE.

02:46.500 --> 02:47.667
IT'S MAKING ME CRAZY.

02:47.700 --> 02:48.700
YEAH, WELL...

02:48.733 --> 02:49.733
OKAY, AND WHAT
DO YOU THINK ?

02:49.767 --> 02:50.900
DOES EVERYTHING
LOOK ALRIGHT ?

02:50.933 --> 02:53.233
YES, IT LOOKS FINE,
THE HOUSE LOOKS GREAT.

02:53.267 --> 02:54.733
THE PILLOWS
AND THE...

02:54.767 --> 02:55.800
WHO GIVES A SHIT ?

02:55.833 --> 02:57.267
LOOKS OKAY,
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE ?

02:57.300 --> 02:58.333
[ doorbell ]

02:58.367 --> 02:59.333
OKAY, HERE WE GO.

02:59.367 --> 03:01.533
OKAY, LET'S GET
THIS OVER WITH.

03:01.567 --> 03:04.567
ALRIGHT,
BEST BEHAVIOR, PLEASE.

03:07.867 --> 03:08.933
HI.

03:08.967 --> 03:09.967
HI.

03:10.067 --> 03:11.567
PLEASE COME IN.

03:11.600 --> 03:12.600
DEAN.

03:12.633 --> 03:13.633
HI, DEAN, I'M LARRY.

03:13.667 --> 03:15.333
HI, PHYLLIS.

03:17.233 --> 03:19.700
I'M FINALLY IN THE HOUSE
THAT JERRY SEINFELD BUILT.

03:19.733 --> 03:22.067
WITH HIS OWN HANDS.

03:22.067 --> 03:23.067
AND SOME HAMMERS.

03:23.067 --> 03:25.067
HE ACTUALLY WORKED ON IT
LIKE JIMMY CARTER.

03:25.100 --> 03:26.600
HE CAN DO THAT
KIND OF THING.

03:26.633 --> 03:29.900
OKAY, THIS IS
THE LIVING ROOM.

03:31.433 --> 03:33.333
IS THAT SWISS COFFEE
OR VANILLA BEAN ?

03:33.367 --> 03:36.067
I THINK IT'S
CHOCOLATE CHO CHO.

03:36.100 --> 03:39.433
HE'S TEASING, YOU KNOW,
LET'S HEAD OUTSIDE.

03:39.467 --> 03:41.333
LET ME SHOW YOU
THE PROBLEM.

03:41.367 --> 03:42.767
THERE IT IS.

03:42.800 --> 03:44.067
THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN
LOOKING AT DAY AND NIGHT.

03:44.100 --> 03:45.133
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT ?

03:45.167 --> 03:47.733
JESUS CHRIST.

03:47.767 --> 03:49.300
IT WAS LIKE THAT
WHEN WE MOVED IN,

03:49.333 --> 03:51.967
AND IT HAS BEEN
BUGGING ME SO MUCH,

03:52.067 --> 03:52.967
I CAN'T EVEN
TELL YOU.

03:53.067 --> 03:54.800
I'M GONNA GET A DIVORCE,
I'M TELLING YOU.

03:54.833 --> 03:57.100
I CAN'T TAKE
HER ANYMORE !

03:57.133 --> 03:58.200
THAT'S HORRIBLE.

03:58.233 --> 04:00.433
TELL ME EXACTLY WHAT HAS
TO BE DONE WITH THAT.

04:00.467 --> 04:01.533
BECAUSE THAT HAS
GOT TO BE FIXED.

04:01.567 --> 04:02.733
THAT'S HORRIBLE.

04:02.767 --> 04:05.500
ALL YOU GUYS HAVE TO DO
IS SIGN SOME PAPERS.

04:05.533 --> 04:06.567
RIGHT.

04:06.600 --> 04:07.667
WE'VE TAKEN CARE
OF EVERYTHING ELSE.

04:07.700 --> 04:09.100
YEAH, THEY PUT
IT UNDERGROUND.

04:09.133 --> 04:10.800
IT'S ALL
ENVIRONMENTALLY SAFE.

04:10.833 --> 04:12.167
THIS HAS TO BE BURIED.

04:12.200 --> 04:13.200
THANK YOU.

04:13.233 --> 04:14.233
[ phone ]

04:14.267 --> 04:16.433
LET THE MACHINE GET IT,
IT'S OKAY.

04:16.467 --> 04:19.733
( female )
Hi, we're not in right now,
so, just leave a message.

04:19.767 --> 04:21.133
( male )
Larry, it's Jeff.

04:21.167 --> 04:24.400
That kid that I sponsored,
the one who set that fire,

04:24.433 --> 04:25.633
the camp called.

04:25.667 --> 04:28.800
They want me to pay
$17,000 in damages.

04:28.833 --> 04:30.200
Me ?!

04:30.233 --> 04:32.433
If you know any lawyer that
handles this sort of thing,

04:32.467 --> 04:33.533
call me.

04:33.567 --> 04:34.600
Call me anyhow.

04:34.633 --> 04:36.067
I'm nuts, bye.

04:36.067 --> 04:37.933
OKAY, I DIDN'T KNOW
WHO THAT WAS...

04:37.967 --> 04:38.933
THAT'S MY MANAGER.

04:38.967 --> 04:40.400
I'M A LAWYER.

04:40.433 --> 04:41.433
YOU ARE ?

04:41.467 --> 04:42.467
YEAH.

04:42.500 --> 04:43.533
REALLY ?

04:43.567 --> 04:45.433
DID JEFF SAY
HE NEEDED A LAWYER ?

04:45.467 --> 04:46.900
I OVERHEARD THAT,
THAT YOU WERE LOOKING...

04:46.933 --> 04:47.933
OH, MY GOD.

04:47.967 --> 04:49.900
RUTGERS AND UNIVERSITY
OF VERMONT, TOO.

04:49.933 --> 04:51.100
HOLY !

04:51.133 --> 04:52.633
LOOK AT THIS.

04:52.667 --> 04:53.667
KISMET.

04:53.700 --> 04:55.333
ISN'T THAT WHAT
IT'S CALLED ?

04:55.367 --> 04:58.133
I'LL BE HAPPY TO
GIVE HIM YOUR NUMBER.

04:58.167 --> 04:59.767
I'M HAPPY
TO HELP OUT.

04:59.800 --> 05:00.967
LOOK AT THIS,
YOU GOT A NEW CLIENT.

05:01.067 --> 05:03.200
DID YOU THINK YOU'D COME
AND GET A NEW CLIENT ?

05:03.233 --> 05:04.467
AND WHO KNOWS,
YOU KNOW WHAT ?

05:04.500 --> 05:07.467
MAYBE I'LL BE ABLE TO
NEED A LAWYER SOMEDAY.

05:07.500 --> 05:08.500
ANYTHING
COULD HAPPEN.

05:08.533 --> 05:10.067
BECAUSE A LOT
OF PEOPLE SUE ME.

05:10.067 --> 05:12.867
I'M VERY VULGAR AND YOU
MIGHT WIND UP SUING ME.

05:12.900 --> 05:14.733
I WOULD
NEVER SUE YOU,
NO, NO.

05:14.767 --> 05:16.767
CAN I ASK YOU
A QUESTION ?

05:16.800 --> 05:20.133
DO THE CAST MEMBERS EVER
COME OVER TO THE HOUSE ?

05:20.167 --> 05:23.400
JUST HANG OUT WITH YOU
BY THE POOL AND...

05:23.433 --> 05:26.667
WELL, NOT BY THE POOL,
BUT THEY HAVE COME OVER, YES.

05:26.700 --> 05:27.667
THEY'RE FRIENDS.

05:27.700 --> 05:29.400
DEAN, WHY DON'T YOU
JUST TELL THE TRUTH

05:29.433 --> 05:30.700
AND TELL THEM WHO
YOUR BIGGEST...

05:30.733 --> 05:33.233
I'LL JUST SAY IT, SHE PLAYED
ELAINE ON THE SHOW.

05:33.267 --> 05:34.400
JULIA.

05:34.433 --> 05:35.567
HE'S OBSESSED
WITH HER.

05:35.600 --> 05:37.200
HE THINKS SHE'S
THE MOST TALENTED ACTRESS.

05:37.233 --> 05:38.533
YEAH, SHE'S GREAT.

05:38.567 --> 05:39.633
OKAY, SHE'S NOT
JUST BEAUTIFUL.

05:39.667 --> 05:41.867
AND SHE'S NOT
JUST TALENTED.

05:41.900 --> 05:42.967
SHE'S SUBLIME.

05:43.067 --> 05:44.933
TELL ME IF I'M GOING
OVER THE LINE HERE,

05:44.967 --> 05:47.667
BUT, IT'S ALWAYS BEEN
A DREAM OF MINE

05:47.700 --> 05:51.467
TO MEET
JULIA LOUIS-DREYFUS,

05:51.500 --> 05:53.100
JUST MEET HER
IN PERSON.

05:53.133 --> 05:54.800
AND IF YOU COULD JUST
MAKE A PHONE CALL,

05:54.833 --> 05:58.733
MAKE THAT HAPPEN,
THAT WOULD BE SO GREAT.

05:58.767 --> 06:01.333
I'M MORE THAN
HAPPY TO CALL HER UP.

06:01.367 --> 06:03.667
I CAN'T GUARANTEE.

06:03.700 --> 06:06.100
IT'S SO HARD TO GET ANYTHING
ABSOLUTELY GUARANTEED.

06:06.133 --> 06:08.400
IT'S JUST LIKE YOU WANT
TO GET SOMETHING BURIED,

06:08.433 --> 06:10.400
YOU DON'T KNOW IF
IT'S GUARANTEED,

06:10.433 --> 06:12.200
YOU DON'T EVEN
KNOW IF THAT...

06:12.233 --> 06:14.467
BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT
OF PAPERS TO BE SIGNED.

06:14.500 --> 06:16.500
I AGREE WITH YOU THERE.

06:18.100 --> 06:19.933
I KNOW I CAN
MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN.

06:19.967 --> 06:23.100
I DON'T SAY I THINK I CAN
MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN.

06:23.133 --> 06:24.200
I CAN MAKE
SOMETHING HAPPEN.

06:24.233 --> 06:26.967
I JUST WANTED
TO BE CLEAR...

06:27.067 --> 06:28.267
I THINK YOU'RE
PRETTY CLEAR.

06:28.300 --> 06:29.500
WE HAVE AN
UNDERSTANDING,

06:29.533 --> 06:31.400
THIS HAS TO BE BURIED.

06:31.433 --> 06:32.433
YEAH, YEAH.

06:32.467 --> 06:33.467
I'M GOING TO
GIVE YOU MY NUMBER.

06:33.500 --> 06:34.533
GREAT, GREAT.

06:34.567 --> 06:35.567
YEAH, WE'LL DO THAT
ON THE WAY OUT.

06:35.600 --> 06:36.600
YEAH.

06:36.633 --> 06:38.400
OH, IT'S SO NICE
TO MEET YOU GUYS.

06:38.433 --> 06:39.633
WOULD YOU LIKE TO
HAVE DINNER, TOO ?

06:39.667 --> 06:41.467
I'VE GOT A NICE CASSEROLE
IN THE OVEN RIGHT NOW.

06:41.500 --> 06:45.133
I WOULD KILL TO HAVE
YOUR CASSEROLE...

06:45.167 --> 06:46.733
LISTEN, I CAN
WRAP IT UP...

06:46.767 --> 06:49.667
I CAN'T DO IT BECAUSE
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG

06:49.700 --> 06:51.200
WITH MY STOMACH.

06:51.233 --> 06:52.567
OKAY ?

06:52.600 --> 06:55.233
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR COMING OVER.

06:55.267 --> 06:57.767
LET ME JUST
SHOW YOU OUT.

07:01.500 --> 07:02.700
FUCK HIM !

07:02.733 --> 07:05.133
FUCK HIM !

07:05.167 --> 07:08.633
JULIA LOUIS-DREYFUS IS
NOT SHOWING UP AT HIS HOUSE,

07:08.667 --> 07:09.967
AND YOU'LL HAVE
TO KILL ME

07:10.067 --> 07:11.500
BEFORE I CALL HER
TO DO THAT.

07:11.533 --> 07:13.800
AND I WILL MOVE,
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME ?

07:13.833 --> 07:16.433
I WILL MOVE BEFORE
I MAKE THAT PHONE CALL.

07:16.467 --> 07:18.333
MOVE !

07:18.367 --> 07:19.467
IF YOU WANNA GET
THAT WIRE DOWN,

07:19.500 --> 07:20.467
START LOOKING
FOR A HOUSE.

07:20.500 --> 07:23.233
LET'S RELAX
FOR A MOMENT, OKAY.

07:23.267 --> 07:25.067
TAKE A DEEP BREATH.

07:25.067 --> 07:26.933
WHAT, THE GUY'S
40-YEARS-OLD ?

07:26.967 --> 07:28.767
HE'S GOTTA MEET
JULIA LOUIS-DREYFUS ?!

07:28.800 --> 07:31.067
WHAT KIND OF PERSON
IS THAT ?!

07:31.100 --> 07:32.433
HE'S A FAN.

07:32.467 --> 07:34.767
WHAT DOES HE EXPECT
TO GAIN FROM SUCH A MEETING ?

07:34.800 --> 07:36.800
WHAT DOES HE THINK,
HE'S GONNA GO OVER THERE,

07:36.833 --> 07:38.167
SHE'S GONNA BE
SO CHARMED BY HIM,

07:38.200 --> 07:40.067
THAT ALL OF A SUDDEN
THEY'RE GONNA START
BECOMING FRIENDS ?

07:40.100 --> 07:42.467
THEY'LL TALK ON THE PHONE
AND GO OUT TO DINNER TOGETHER,

07:42.500 --> 07:43.500
GO TO THE MOVIES ?

07:43.533 --> 07:45.167
WHAT, START E-MAILING
EACH OTHER ?

07:45.200 --> 07:46.433
SUMMER VACATIONS ?!

07:46.467 --> 07:48.233
IS HE OUT OF
HIS FUCKING MIND ?!

07:48.267 --> 07:52.933
LARRY, ONE PHONE CALL,
ONE SMALL FAVOR,

07:52.967 --> 07:55.133
TO MAKE THIS HOUSE
COMPLETELY PERFECT.

07:55.167 --> 07:58.067
I CAN'T LIVE WITH
THAT WIRE ANY LONGER.

07:58.067 --> 07:59.200
I'VE DONE
SO MUCH WORK

07:59.233 --> 08:01.667
TRYING TO GET
THIS REMOVED...

08:01.700 --> 08:04.167
WHY DOES THERE HAVE TO BE
300 PILLOWS ON THE BED ?

08:04.200 --> 08:07.467
LISTEN, PLEASE,
I'M ASKING YOU.

08:09.933 --> 08:12.067
I DON'T THINK
SHE'LL MIND.

08:12.067 --> 08:13.900
AND, SHE'LL PROBABLY
THINK IT'S FUNNY.

08:13.933 --> 08:17.333
YEAH, SHE'S GONNA THINK
IT'S REALLY FUNNY.

08:19.900 --> 08:22.733
I REALLY THOUGHT WE HAD THE DEAL
CINCHED WITH THE LAWYER,

08:22.767 --> 08:23.967
WITH JEFF.

08:24.067 --> 08:25.067
I KNOW.

08:25.100 --> 08:26.933
I SHOULD CALL JEFF
AND TELL HIM ABOUT THIS.

08:26.967 --> 08:29.100
WAIT, WAIT,
WHAT TIME IS IT ?

08:29.133 --> 08:31.067
IT'S 10:20.

08:31.067 --> 08:32.500
10 O'CLOCK IS
THE CUT OFF TIME.

08:32.533 --> 08:33.767
YOU DON'T CALL
PEOPLE AFTER 10.

08:33.800 --> 08:35.800
NO, NO, NO,
THE CUT OFF TIME IS 10:30.

08:35.833 --> 08:37.367
LARRY, THEY HAVE KIDS.

08:37.400 --> 08:40.333
10 O'CLOCK, YOU DON'T
CALL AFTER 10 O'CLOCK.

08:40.367 --> 08:41.733
NO, NO, 10:30.

08:41.767 --> 08:42.733
THE CUT OFF TIME--

08:42.767 --> 08:43.933
IS THAT RIGHT ?

08:43.967 --> 08:46.267
YEAH, CUT OFF TIME'S 10:30,
EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT.

08:46.300 --> 08:47.633
IT'S A 10:30 CUT OFF.

08:47.667 --> 08:48.767
OKAY.

08:54.700 --> 08:56.733
OH, HEY, SUSIE,
IT'S LARRY.

08:56.767 --> 08:58.900
DID I WAKE YOU ?

08:58.933 --> 09:00.700
OH, I'M REALLY SORRY.

09:02.367 --> 09:04.567
NO, NO, IT'S NOT,
IT'S NOTHING.

09:04.600 --> 09:06.233
I'LL JUST TALK
TO HIM TOMORROW.

09:06.267 --> 09:09.433
NO, I'M REALLY SORRY.

09:11.067 --> 09:12.267
OKAY.

09:12.300 --> 09:13.600
ALRIGHT.

09:15.167 --> 09:16.667
HOW'D THAT
WORK OUT FOR YOU ?

09:20.667 --> 09:21.933
SUSIE WAS
PRETTY PISSED OFF.

09:21.967 --> 09:23.267
SHE'S REALLY UPSET.

09:23.300 --> 09:24.933
10 O'CLOCK IS
THE CUT OFF, MAN.

09:24.967 --> 09:27.067
I THOUGHT
THE CUT OFF POINT
WAS 10:30.

09:27.067 --> 09:29.633
NO, 10:20, YOU CALLED,
10 O'CLOCK'S THE CUT OFF.

09:29.667 --> 09:31.500
IF YOU CALLED 10:01,
SHE'D BE JUST AS MAD.

09:31.533 --> 09:32.600
IS THAT RIGHT ?

09:32.633 --> 09:34.333
LISTEN, I'VE GOT
A BIG PROBLEM.

09:34.367 --> 09:37.833
DEAN, YOUR LAWYER FRIEND,
I DON'T THINK HE'S COMPETENT.

09:37.867 --> 09:39.533
I THINK YOU HOOKED ME UP
WITH A FREAK.

09:39.567 --> 09:41.400
I THINK HE'S PROBABLY
A GOOD LAWYER.

09:41.433 --> 09:42.633
HE'S A WEIRD GUY.

09:42.667 --> 09:44.600
HE'S WEIRD,
BUT HE'S VERY SHREWD.

09:44.633 --> 09:46.067
SHREWD ?

09:46.067 --> 09:48.233
HE'S A WIRE LAWYER,
I KNOW, I KNOW.

09:48.267 --> 09:49.933
I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE DOING.

09:49.967 --> 09:52.467
YOU'VE GOT ME PAYING
SOME EXPENSIVE IDIOT LAWYER

09:52.500 --> 09:53.500
SO, YOU CAN HAVE
YOUR WIRE DROPPED DOWN.

09:53.533 --> 09:54.700
I KNOW YOUR GAMES.

09:54.733 --> 09:56.233
I'M SORRY.

09:56.267 --> 09:58.200
I'M SORRY YOU SCREWED ME
WITH THIS GUY,

09:58.233 --> 09:59.233
AND I KNOW IT.

09:59.267 --> 10:00.600
I WANNA LET YOU KNOW
THAT I KNOW IT.

10:00.633 --> 10:01.700
I KNOW IT.

10:01.733 --> 10:04.167
WAIT, FIRST OF ALL,

10:04.200 --> 10:06.200
I DON'T EVEN HAVE TO TELL YOU
THE STORY BEHIND THAT.

10:06.233 --> 10:07.667
SEE HOW HE DOES,
A FEW MORE DAYS.

10:07.700 --> 10:08.933
CAN I FIRE HIM ?
I WANNA FIRE HIM.

10:08.967 --> 10:10.167
YOU CANNOT
GET RID OF HIM.

10:10.200 --> 10:11.700
I HAVE TO,
HE'S A FREAK.

10:11.733 --> 10:15.667
I KNOW HE IS, BUT, PLEASE,
IF YOU GET RID OF THEM,

10:15.700 --> 10:18.033
WE'RE NEVER GONNA GET RID OF
THAT WIRE IN THE BACKYARD.

10:18.067 --> 10:19.867
THE GUY'S
A TOTAL PRICK,

10:19.900 --> 10:21.500
AND HE WILL DO
A GOOD JOB, BELIEVE ME.

10:21.533 --> 10:22.533
PRICK'S ARE GOOD.

10:22.567 --> 10:24.767
YOU WANT A PRICK,
AND THIS GUY'S A PRICK.

10:24.800 --> 10:25.967
LOOK AT YOU.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.200
YOU'RE A PRICK,
YOU'RE DOING A GOOD JOB.

10:28.233 --> 10:29.500
ARE YOU A PRICK, OR,
ARE YOU NOT A PRICK ?

10:29.533 --> 10:30.533
I AM A PRICK.

10:30.567 --> 10:32.400
IN BUSINESS,
ARE YOU A PRICK ?

10:32.433 --> 10:33.433
THIS GUY'S A BIGGER
PRICK THAN YOU.

10:33.467 --> 10:34.433
I'M IN A LOT
OF TROUBLE,

10:34.467 --> 10:35.700
AND YOU'RE NOT
TAKING IT SERIOUSLY.

10:35.733 --> 10:37.167
THE CAMP'S
GONNA CHARGE ME.

10:37.200 --> 10:38.200
THEY'RE TRYING
TO GET ME TO PAY.

10:38.233 --> 10:39.400
I KNOW.

10:39.433 --> 10:41.500
( glass breaking )

10:41.533 --> 10:44.133
WELL, LISTEN TO ME,
THAT KID,

10:44.167 --> 10:47.233
HE CALLED ME BEGGING ME
TO COME STAY WITH ME,

10:47.267 --> 10:48.400
HE GOT KICKED
OUT OF THE CAMP,

10:48.433 --> 10:50.567
AND HE WANTS TO
COME STAY AT MY HOUSE.

10:50.600 --> 10:52.700
HE SAID, "LOOK, IF I GO
HOME EARLY FROM CAMP,

10:52.733 --> 10:54.000
"MY MOM WILL KILL ME,

10:54.033 --> 10:55.000
THINKING THAT
I DID BAD THINGS."

10:55.033 --> 10:56.400
YOU LET THIS KID
STAY IN YOUR HOUSE ?

10:56.433 --> 10:57.733
YEAH.

10:57.767 --> 10:59.133
SO, YOU'RE GOING TO
PUT UP A SOCIOPATH

10:59.167 --> 11:00.433
FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS ?

11:00.467 --> 11:02.133
HE'S NOT A SOCIOPATH,
HE'S A VERY GOOD KID.

11:02.167 --> 11:03.767
THE KID BURNED DOWN
THE CANTEEN...

11:03.800 --> 11:05.300
HE BURNED DOWN
THE CANTEEN.

11:05.333 --> 11:07.167
AND HE BURNED
DOWN THE CABIN.

11:07.200 --> 11:08.567
BUT THEY WERE
BOTH ACCIDENTS.

11:08.600 --> 11:09.633
GOT INSURANCE ?

11:09.667 --> 11:10.667
YEAH.

11:10.700 --> 11:11.700
GET THE KID TO
BURN DOWN MY HOUSE

11:11.733 --> 11:13.500
SO I DON'T HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT THE WIRE.

11:13.533 --> 11:15.133
THAT I WOULD
LOVE TO DO.

11:15.167 --> 11:16.767
I WOULD LOVE
TO DO THAT.

11:21.933 --> 11:23.567
THANKS AGAIN
FOR DOING THIS.

11:23.600 --> 11:24.900
LISTEN, IT'S FINE.

11:24.933 --> 11:26.067
BUT, I'VE GOTTA
TELL YOU SOMETHING.

11:26.100 --> 11:28.067
I'VE GOT 10 MINUTES,
TOPS, THAT'S IT.

11:28.067 --> 11:30.067
BECAUSE, I GOTTA
GET TO SCHOOL,

11:30.067 --> 11:32.300
THE WHOLE THING,
OKAY, REALLY.

11:32.333 --> 11:34.300
( clearing throat )

11:34.333 --> 11:35.967
WHO IS IT ?

11:36.067 --> 11:37.833
IT'S LARRY DAVID.

11:37.867 --> 11:39.600
LARRY ?

11:39.633 --> 11:40.767
ARE YOU BY YOURSELF ?

11:40.800 --> 11:43.967
NO, I'M WITH JULIA.

11:44.067 --> 11:44.933
JUL--

11:48.333 --> 11:49.767
OH, MY.

11:49.800 --> 11:51.167
ARE YOU OKAY ?

11:51.200 --> 11:52.833
OH, MY GOD.

11:52.867 --> 11:55.533
JULIA LOUIS-DREYFUS,
THIS IS PHYLLIS.

11:55.567 --> 11:57.467
WEINSTOCK,
PHYLLIS WEINSTOCK.

11:57.500 --> 11:59.733
HI, IT'S NICE
TO MEET YOU.

11:59.767 --> 12:01.267
ARE YOU OKAY ?

12:01.300 --> 12:03.467
YES AND NO.

12:03.500 --> 12:04.833
OH, DEAR.

12:04.867 --> 12:06.500
YES AND NO.

12:07.967 --> 12:09.933
MY CAT DIED.

12:09.967 --> 12:11.567
MY CAT DIED.

12:11.600 --> 12:12.567
OH.

12:12.600 --> 12:15.567
PLEASE COME IN,
PLEASE COME IN.

12:15.600 --> 12:18.067
PLEASE SIT DOWN,
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE.

12:19.700 --> 12:20.967
WHERE'S DEAN ?

12:21.067 --> 12:23.067
DEAN'S WITH JEFF.

12:23.100 --> 12:24.400
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
WHY IS HE WITH JEFF ?

12:24.433 --> 12:25.500
WHO IS JEFF ?

12:25.533 --> 12:26.667
JEFF'S MY MANAGER.

12:26.700 --> 12:29.800
YEAH, JEFF CRANE,
HE'S WITH JEFF.

12:29.833 --> 12:32.133
HE CALLED, HE SAID,

12:32.167 --> 12:34.267
I'LL BE HOME IN
20 OR 25 MINUTES.

12:34.300 --> 12:35.667
DON'T LET THEM LEAVE.

12:35.700 --> 12:37.367
AND I SAID,
DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT.

12:37.400 --> 12:41.667
I CAN'T IT HERE
THIS LONG, REALLY.

12:41.700 --> 12:44.367
THIS IS JUST
BAD TIMING FOR ME.

12:44.400 --> 12:46.300
I'VE GOT TO
GET OUT...

12:48.500 --> 12:52.433
I'M SO SORRY
ABOUT YOUR CAT.

12:52.467 --> 12:55.367
YEAH, AND IT'S TAIL
HAS BEEN TRAPPED

12:55.400 --> 12:58.633
WHEN THE GARDENER
CAME OVER,

12:58.667 --> 13:02.100
IT HAD BEEN TRAPPED
IN THE LAWNMOWER...

13:02.133 --> 13:03.167
GOD.

13:03.200 --> 13:05.167
POOR KITTY.

13:05.200 --> 13:07.200
YOU KNOW WHAT, I DON'T
WANNA TALK ABOUT MITTENS.

13:07.233 --> 13:08.733
I'VE GOT
A BETTER IDEA.

13:08.767 --> 13:10.700
HEY, BRAINSTORM.

13:10.733 --> 13:13.667
PHYLLIS HAS JUST
HAD A COMPLETE,

13:13.700 --> 13:16.233
I DON'T KNOW WHY
I DIDN'T THINK OF THIS.

13:16.267 --> 13:17.267
CAMCORDER.

13:17.300 --> 13:18.700
I'M GETTING
THE CAMCORDER.

13:18.733 --> 13:20.433
NO, DON'T GET
A CAMCORDER.

13:20.467 --> 13:21.800
PLEASE, DON'T.

13:21.833 --> 13:24.300
OKAY, I THOUGHT
THAT THE HUSBAND

13:24.333 --> 13:25.800
WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE HERE.

13:25.833 --> 13:27.500
ISN'T HE SUPPOSED
TO BE HERE ?

13:27.533 --> 13:29.300
IS HE THE ONE WE'RE
SUPPOSED TO MEET ?

13:29.333 --> 13:30.933
YEAH, HE'S THE ONE
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO MEET.

13:30.967 --> 13:32.167
IT'S JUST ANOTHER
10 MINUTES.

13:32.200 --> 13:33.200
BECAUSE, LARRY,
I'M NOT KIDDING.

13:33.233 --> 13:34.967
I'VE GOT TO GET
TO THE SCHOOL...

13:35.067 --> 13:36.700
THIS IS JUST
SO OUTRAGEOUS.

13:36.733 --> 13:38.233
DO YOU KNOW
THIS WOMAN ?

13:38.267 --> 13:39.567
I'VE MET HER
ONCE BEFORE.

13:39.600 --> 13:41.100
SHE CAME OVER MY HOUSE,
I TOLD YOU.

13:41.133 --> 13:42.800
YOU ARE LIVING
NEXT TO...

13:42.833 --> 13:45.067
ANOTHER 10 MINUTES
WITH THIS LUNATIC...

13:45.067 --> 13:46.100
SHE'S A LUNATIC.

13:46.133 --> 13:47.500
SHE'S A TOTAL
LUNATIC.

13:47.533 --> 13:49.367
OH, GOD.

13:49.400 --> 13:51.733
OH, THIS IS GOOD,
THIS IS GOOD...

13:51.767 --> 13:53.200
HI, JULIA.

13:53.233 --> 13:54.400
TALK.

13:54.433 --> 13:57.367
YOU KNOW, I DON'T MEAN
TO BE A PARTY POOPER,

13:57.400 --> 14:00.067
BUT I'M NOT REALLY CRAZY
ABOUT THOSE CAMCORDERS.

14:00.100 --> 14:03.067
YOU WANNA ASK LARRY
SOMETHING ON THE MACHINE ?

14:03.067 --> 14:04.933
OKAY, JUST LET
ME GET, OKAY...

14:07.200 --> 14:09.100
TELL ME ABOUT
JERRY SEINFELD,

14:09.133 --> 14:12.300
AND, HE DATES
THOSE YOUNG GIRLS.

14:12.333 --> 14:13.900
WELL, HE'S A EUNUCH.

14:13.933 --> 14:15.267
YES.

14:15.300 --> 14:19.367
HIS TESTICLES WERE CUT OFF
WHEN HE WAS ABOUT 13,

14:19.400 --> 14:22.567
BECAUSE HE WAS IN
THE BETH SHALOM CHOIR.

14:22.600 --> 14:25.067
AND THAT'S WHAT
HE WANTED TO BE,

14:25.067 --> 14:26.100
HE WAS A CHOIR BOY.

14:26.133 --> 14:27.433
JULIA,
IS THAT TRUE ?

14:27.467 --> 14:28.733
DOES HE REALLY
HAVE NO TESTICLES ?

14:28.767 --> 14:30.933
YOU KNOW,
I GOTTA TELL YA,

14:30.967 --> 14:33.200
I DON'T HAVE
ANY FUCKING IDEA.

14:33.233 --> 14:35.433
I THINK
THAT'S ENOUGH.

14:35.467 --> 14:37.100
DEAN'S GONNA
LOVE THIS.

14:37.133 --> 14:38.100
UH, LARRY...

14:38.133 --> 14:42.833
I THINK I'M GONNA
CALL JEFF, OKAY ?

14:42.867 --> 14:44.267
OKAY, GOOD IDEA.

14:44.300 --> 14:45.767
( Julia )
YOUR MANAGER ?

14:45.800 --> 14:48.167
COULD YOU
MAKE IT QUICK,

14:48.200 --> 14:50.200
AND TELL HIM I'VE
GOT A TIME THING.

14:50.233 --> 14:51.333
JULIA, OVER HERE.

14:52.600 --> 14:57.100
HEY, WHAT TIME
DID DEAN LEAVE ?

14:57.133 --> 14:58.533
He didn't leave,
he's still here.

14:58.567 --> 14:59.533
WHAT ?

14:59.567 --> 15:00.933
He's still here.

15:00.967 --> 15:03.600
HE'S STILL THERE ?!

15:03.633 --> 15:05.167
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU
DOING OVER THERE ?

15:05.200 --> 15:07.167
HE'S SUPPOSED
TO BE HERE !

15:07.200 --> 15:08.200
I can't kick
him out,

15:08.233 --> 15:09.267
We've got
business to do.

15:09.300 --> 15:10.800
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
YOU'RE DOING BUSINESS ?

15:10.833 --> 15:12.233
I'VE GOT JULIA LOUIS-DREYFUS
AT HIS HOUSE,

15:12.267 --> 15:13.733
WE'RE WAITING
FOR HIM !

15:13.767 --> 15:15.233
I gotta go,
he's charging me...

15:15.267 --> 15:16.533
OH, THIS
IS RIDICULOUS.

15:16.567 --> 15:19.733
OKAY, WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO GET GOING.

15:19.767 --> 15:20.800
OH, NO.

15:20.833 --> 15:21.833
DEAN'S STILL
AT THE OFFICE.

15:21.867 --> 15:22.900
YOU'RE KIDDING ME.

15:22.933 --> 15:23.933
YOU'RE KIDDING ?

15:23.967 --> 15:25.067
ALRIGHT.

15:25.067 --> 15:27.200
( Larry )
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE ?

15:27.233 --> 15:28.633
( Julia )
THIS IS SO UNUSUAL.

15:28.667 --> 15:30.367
YOU KNOW WHAT ?
I'M GONNA GET THIS.

15:30.400 --> 15:31.433
OH, GREAT !

15:31.467 --> 15:32.433
WHAT IS
ALL THIS ?

15:32.467 --> 15:34.633
I'M AN ANTIQUE
JEWELRY DEALER.

15:34.667 --> 15:38.067
YOU DIDN'T
KNOW THAT.

15:38.067 --> 15:40.067
CAN I SEE THAT
FOR A SECOND ?

15:40.067 --> 15:41.700
JULIA JUST FELL
IN LOVE WITH IT.

15:41.733 --> 15:42.733
( Julia )
I'M IN LOVE WITH IT.

15:42.767 --> 15:44.167
I CAN'T
BELIEVE IT.

15:44.200 --> 15:45.600
I GOTTA TELL YOU,
I JUST LOVE JEWELRY.

15:45.633 --> 15:47.833
THIS IS
THE SAME BRACELET

15:47.867 --> 15:49.167
I WAS GONNA BUY
FOR MY WIFE,

15:49.200 --> 15:53.100
BUT, I GOT IN A FIGHT
WITH RICHARD LEWIS...

15:53.133 --> 15:54.400
I WAS GONNA
GET THIS.

15:54.433 --> 15:56.833
I'VE NEVER TURNED A PIECE
OF JEWELRY AROUND THIS FAST.

15:56.867 --> 15:58.067
I LOVE IT....

15:58.067 --> 16:00.600
... LOVE IT,
THANK YOU.

16:00.633 --> 16:03.500
OH, I HAVE A CHECK FROM
JULIA LOUIS-DREYFUS.

16:03.533 --> 16:05.067
( Julia )
THAT'S SO PRETTY.

16:07.200 --> 16:10.133
I GUESS JULIA WILL
HAVE TO COME BACK OVER.

16:10.167 --> 16:12.467
YOU'LL HAVE TO ARRANGE
ANOTHER MEETING.

16:12.500 --> 16:14.633
ARE YOU OUT
OF YOUR MIND NOW ?

16:14.667 --> 16:15.867
GET JULIA
BACK OVER THERE ?

16:15.900 --> 16:17.933
YOU THINK I'M GONNA
ASK HER AGAIN TO DO THIS ?

16:17.967 --> 16:20.300
WE'RE NOT GONNA GIVE UP
ON IT JUST LIKE THAT.

16:20.333 --> 16:21.567
WELL, I'M NOT
ASKING HER AGAIN.

16:21.600 --> 16:24.300
YOU WANNA ASK HER,
YOU GO ASK HER.

16:24.333 --> 16:26.633
I'M NOT ASKING
HER AGAIN, THAT'S IT.

16:26.667 --> 16:28.833
LARRY, DO YOU NOT
EVEN CARE ABOUT ME ?

16:28.867 --> 16:30.800
I LOVE YOU, I CARE
VERY MUCH ABOUT YOU,

16:30.833 --> 16:32.400
BUT, I HAVE A
FRIENDSHIP WITH JULIA.

16:32.433 --> 16:34.400
I CAN'T IMPOSE MORE
ON THAT FRIENDSHIP.

16:34.433 --> 16:36.067
SHE'S ALREADY DONE
THIS FAVOR FOR ME.

16:36.067 --> 16:37.133
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND ?

16:37.167 --> 16:39.533
IT WOULD NOT KILL YOU TO
JUST MAKE A PHONE CALL

16:39.567 --> 16:42.433
AND ASK HER IF
SHE COULD RESCHEDULE.

16:42.467 --> 16:43.900
WHERE'S MY PAD ?

16:43.933 --> 16:45.133
WHAT ?

16:45.167 --> 16:47.233
I CAN'T FIND MY PAD.

16:47.267 --> 16:49.867
YOUR LITTLE PAD ?

16:49.900 --> 16:51.467
YEAH, MY LITTLE
BROWN PAD.

16:51.500 --> 16:53.333
THAT YOU WRITE YOUR
IDEAS DOWN ON ?

16:53.367 --> 16:55.933
I DON'T KNOW
WHERE THAT IS.

16:55.967 --> 16:58.367
WHERE THE HELL'S
MY PAD ?

16:58.400 --> 16:59.500
JESUS !

16:59.533 --> 17:02.200
WHAT DID I DO
WITH THAT ?

17:02.233 --> 17:03.467
OH !

17:04.633 --> 17:06.900
I THINK I LEFT IT
IN JULIA'S HOUSE

17:06.933 --> 17:08.667
WHEN I TALKED TO HER
ABOUT DEAN.

17:08.700 --> 17:10.133
I TOOK IT OUT
IN HER KITCHEN.

17:10.167 --> 17:12.300
THAT'S THE LAST
TIME I USED IT.

17:12.333 --> 17:14.067
WELL, THEN, WHY DON'T
YOU CALL HER TOMORROW,

17:14.067 --> 17:16.567
AND YOU CAN ASK
HER ABOUT...

17:16.600 --> 17:18.233
WAIT, WHAT
TIME IS IT ?

17:18.267 --> 17:19.300
IT'S 10 TO 10.

17:19.333 --> 17:20.567
WHAT TIME IS
THE CUT OFF ?

17:20.600 --> 17:22.633
CUT OFF'S 10,
10 MINUTES BEFORE
THE CUT OFF.

17:22.667 --> 17:25.300
NO PROBLEM,
I'M RIGHT IN THERE.

17:25.333 --> 17:26.400
NO, YOU'RE
PUSHING IT.

17:26.433 --> 17:28.467
I'M NOT PUSHING,
TWO MINUTES IS PUSHING.

17:28.500 --> 17:29.867
10 MINUTES
IS NOT PUSHING.

17:29.900 --> 17:31.333
THAT'S NOT A PUSH.

17:31.367 --> 17:33.333
THAT IS RIGHT
IN THE WHEELHOUSE.

17:33.367 --> 17:35.633
I HAVE 10 MINUTES
BEFORE THE CUT OFF TIME.

17:40.067 --> 17:41.633
HI, JULIA.

17:41.667 --> 17:43.767
OH, I'M SO SORRY.

17:45.600 --> 17:48.733
NO, IT'S 10 TO.

17:48.767 --> 17:51.267
REALLY ?

17:51.300 --> 17:54.600
I GOTTA TELL YOU, I NEVER
HEARD OF A 9:30 CUT OFF.

18:03.400 --> 18:04.367
HI.

18:04.400 --> 18:05.467
HI.

18:05.500 --> 18:07.800
I'M SORRY ABOUT THIS.

18:07.833 --> 18:09.967
IT'LL TAKE ME TWO SECONDS
AND I'LL BE OUT OF YOUR HAIR.

18:10.067 --> 18:11.200
( clearing throat )

18:11.233 --> 18:12.700
I DON'T HAVE IT,
THOUGH.

18:12.733 --> 18:14.067
IT'S NOT HERE.

18:14.100 --> 18:16.067
WELL, HI, BRAD.

18:16.100 --> 18:19.433
HEY, SORRY FOR
COMING OVER SO LATE,

18:19.467 --> 18:21.533
BUT THIS PAD IS
REALLY IMPORTANT.

18:21.567 --> 18:23.267
YOU SURE
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT ?

18:23.300 --> 18:25.367
IT'S BROWN, IT'S GOT
LIKE A BLACK TRIM, NO ?

18:25.400 --> 18:26.533
UH UH.

18:26.567 --> 18:27.933
I'LL JUST TAKE A QUICK
LOOK IN THE KITCHEN.

18:27.967 --> 18:29.233
I'LL BE OUT OF
YOUR HAIR IN A SECOND.

18:29.267 --> 18:33.133
I'LL JUST TAKE
A QUICK LOOK.

18:33.167 --> 18:34.467
ALSO, I'M SORRY ABOUT
CALLING SO LATE,

18:34.500 --> 18:37.100
BUT, I THOUGHT
THE CUT OFF TIME WAS...

18:37.133 --> 18:39.067
10:00.

18:39.067 --> 18:40.100
NO, IT'S NOT.

18:40.133 --> 18:41.333
IT'S 9:30
FOR US.

18:41.367 --> 18:45.233
MOST PEOPLE HAVE
A 10:00 OR 10:30 CUT OFF.

18:45.267 --> 18:46.633
I THINK 9:30
WITH KIDS...

18:46.667 --> 18:49.167
SEEMS LIKE AN EARLY
CUT OFF TO ME.

18:49.200 --> 18:51.200
IT'S PRETTY STANDARD...

18:51.233 --> 18:53.833
AND FOR VISITORS,
IT'S MORE LIKE 9:00.

18:53.867 --> 18:54.900
YEAH.

18:54.933 --> 18:56.567
THAT'S
THE TELEPHONE DRAWER,

18:56.600 --> 18:58.833
SO, THERE'S NOT GONNA
BE ANYTHING IN THERE.

18:58.867 --> 19:01.767
AND THOSE ARE
MY NOTES,

19:01.800 --> 19:03.600
AND, THESE ARE
MY BILLS AND STUFF.

19:03.633 --> 19:05.533
( Brad )
I LOOKED PRETTY
CAREFULLY IN HERE, LARRY.

19:05.567 --> 19:06.867
IT'S NOT IN
THE KITCHEN.

19:06.900 --> 19:09.367
OF COURSE,
THOSE ARE COOKBOOKS.

19:09.400 --> 19:11.133
LARRY...

19:12.533 --> 19:14.433
SORRY, OKAY.

19:14.467 --> 19:17.767
IT'S DEFINITELY
NOT...

19:17.800 --> 19:19.067
YOU KNOW,
SOMETIMES...

19:19.067 --> 19:20.067
THOSE ARE NAPKINS.

19:20.067 --> 19:22.200
WE'LL LOOK CAREFULLY
TOMORROW, LARRY.

19:22.233 --> 19:23.600
AND THOSE ARE
MORE PLACEMATS.

19:23.633 --> 19:25.067
YOU KNOW, I'M GONNA
CHECK THE PATIO

19:25.067 --> 19:26.633
BECAUSE THAT'S
WHERE WE WERE TALKING.

19:26.667 --> 19:29.100
IT MAY HAVE DROPPED OUT OF
MY POCKET OR SOMETHING.

19:29.133 --> 19:30.867
WANT ME TO
KICK HIM OUT ?

19:30.900 --> 19:32.100
HOW ARE YOU GONNA
KICK HIM OUT ?

19:32.133 --> 19:33.633
I'LL JUST
MAKE A JOKE.

19:33.667 --> 19:36.533
IF YOU CAN MAKE A JOKE,
BUT DON'T MAKE THIS AWKWARD.

19:36.567 --> 19:38.300
OKAY, I REALIZE
WHERE IT IS.

19:38.333 --> 19:40.767
I MADE A PHONE CALL
IN THAT OFFICE.

19:40.800 --> 19:43.167
IN MY OFFICE ?

19:43.200 --> 19:46.300
YOU KNOW, I WAS WORKING
THERE ALL DAY, LARRY.

19:46.333 --> 19:47.800
IT'S REALLY
NOT IN THERE.

19:47.833 --> 19:49.067
( Julia )
LARRY...

19:49.100 --> 19:52.367
LARRY, WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING ?

19:52.400 --> 19:54.333
( Larry )
NO, THAT'S WHERE
I WAS SITTING.

19:54.367 --> 19:58.067
THIS IS BAD,
THIS IS NOT GOOD.

19:58.067 --> 20:00.467
( arguing )

20:00.500 --> 20:01.700
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING ?!

20:01.733 --> 20:02.800
MOMMY ?

20:02.833 --> 20:04.233
BOBBY ?
OH, GREAT !

20:04.267 --> 20:06.633
AND WE HAD A HELLUVA TIME
PUTTING HIM TO BED.

20:06.667 --> 20:08.767
( Larry )
I'M SORRY,
I'M SORRY.

20:08.800 --> 20:11.100
WHAT ARE YOU DOING,
IT'S SO LATE ?

20:11.133 --> 20:12.867
DID YOU FIND
A LITTLE BROWN PAD,

20:12.900 --> 20:15.033
IT HAS LITTLE BLACK
TRIMMING ON THE SIDE ?

20:15.067 --> 20:17.333
( Brad )
LARRY, GO HOME, PLEASE.

20:20.500 --> 20:22.533
BOBBY, NOBODY'S
ANGRY WITH YOU.

20:22.567 --> 20:24.367
LARRY, GO, OKAY ?

20:24.400 --> 20:25.633
JUST GO !

20:25.667 --> 20:27.767
LARRY, GO !

20:27.800 --> 20:29.933
IF WE FIND IT, WE WILL
BRING IT OVER, OKAY.

20:29.967 --> 20:31.000
SEE YA.

20:31.033 --> 20:32.200
WHAT WAS THAT ?

20:32.233 --> 20:34.100
DO YOU THINK I CAN CALL
NEW YORK RIGHT NOW ?

20:34.133 --> 20:35.267
I'M GONNA
CALL SEINFELD.

20:35.300 --> 20:36.833
I GOTTA TELL HIM
ABOUT THIS.

20:36.867 --> 20:38.100
WHAT'S THE CUT OFF
ON NEW YORK ?

20:38.133 --> 20:39.167
I DON'T KNOW.

20:39.200 --> 20:40.333
ABOUT MIDNIGHT.

20:40.367 --> 20:42.433
NO, FORGET IT, THESE ARE
EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES.

20:42.467 --> 20:43.833
I'M COMING UP THERE
IN JUST A SECOND.

20:43.867 --> 20:45.433
MOMMY'S GOTTA CALL

20:45.467 --> 20:46.667
AND THEN I'LL BE

20:46.700 --> 20:48.333
HE'S NOT GONNA
BELIEVE IT.

20:49.300 --> 20:51.100
( Susie )
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE

20:51.133 --> 20:52.467
THAT I HAVE TO
DEAL WITH THIS !

20:52.500 --> 20:54.933
HE HAS RANSACKED
OUR ENTIRE HOUSE !

20:54.967 --> 20:57.333
DO YOU KNOW WHAT

20:57.367 --> 20:59.433
DO YOU WANNA KNOW WHAT
THIS LITTLE SHIT TOOK ?

20:59.467 --> 21:01.733
HE TOOK OUR WEDDING
VIDEO, OKAY ?

21:01.767 --> 21:03.067
YOU WEREN'T
EVEN THINKING !

21:03.067 --> 21:04.133
YOU KNOW WHY ?

21:04.167 --> 21:06.200
'CAUSE YOU'RE A FAT,
FUCKING ASSHOLE,

21:06.233 --> 21:07.433
THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE.

21:07.467 --> 21:10.067
THIS IS NOT MY PROBLEM,
THIS IS YOUR PROBLEM,

21:10.067 --> 21:11.400
DO YOU
UNDERSTAND THAT ?

21:11.433 --> 21:12.800
I'M PISSED,
JEFFREY !

21:12.833 --> 21:14.667
I AM PISSED,
BECAUSE MY WHOLE LIFE

21:14.700 --> 21:16.567

21:23.367 --> 21:25.100
"MR. WAKE ME UP IN

21:25.133 --> 21:26.533
WHAT THE FUCK
ARE YOU DOING HERE ?

21:26.567 --> 21:29.267
JEFF AND I WERE
GONNA PLAY

21:29.300 --> 21:30.700
THE NEW COMPUTER
GOLF GAME.

21:30.733 --> 21:32.067
OH, WERE YOU REALLY ?

21:32.067 --> 21:33.433
WELL, LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING, LARRY.

21:33.467 --> 21:35.733
JEFF'S COMPUTER
GOLF GAME IS GONE !

21:35.767 --> 21:37.133
THE COMPUTER'S GONE !

21:37.167 --> 21:39.500

THE NEW DVD PLAYER'S GONE.

21:39.533 --> 21:40.933

21:51.400 --> 21:52.433

21:52.467 --> 21:53.667
WHO'S FAULT IS IT,
JEFFREY ?

21:53.700 --> 21:54.700
I KNOW IT'S NOT
LARRY'S FAULT.

21:54.733 --> 21:55.933
IT'S THE
KID'S FAULT.

21:55.967 --> 21:57.067
NO, I DON'T THINK
IT'S THE KID'S FAULT.

21:57.067 --> 21:59.067
I'M GONNA
GET HIM !

21:59.067 --> 22:00.133
OH, YOU'RE GOING
TO GET HIM ?!

22:00.167 --> 22:01.667
LOOK AT YOU,

22:01.700 --> 22:04.367
AND, LARRY,
BY THE WAY,

22:04.400 --> 22:06.333
WHAT THE FUCK

22:06.367 --> 22:09.133
CALLING AT 10:20 AT NIGHT
THE OTHER DAY, HUH ?

22:09.167 --> 22:11.267
I THOUGHT
THE CUT OFF
WAS 10:30.

22:11.300 --> 22:12.333
YOU KNOW, I HAVE
TROUBLE SLEEPING ?

22:12.367 --> 22:13.333
NO.

22:13.367 --> 22:14.333
YES, YOU DO.

22:14.367 --> 22:15.433
DON'T KNOW THAT.

22:15.467 --> 22:18.300
YOU NEVER TOLD HIM
ABOUT MY TROUBLE SLEEPING ?

22:18.333 --> 22:20.800
THE CUT OFF
IS 10:00 !

22:20.833 --> 22:21.800
10:00.

22:21.833 --> 22:23.867
A LOTTA THINGS TO DO
DURING THE DAY,

22:23.900 --> 22:24.867
ONCE I GO TO SLEEP,

22:24.900 --> 22:26.533
THEN I HAVE
TO TAKE A XANAX !

22:26.567 --> 22:28.133
I WAS CRAZY
THAT NIGHT, OKAY ?

22:28.167 --> 22:29.700
YOU HAVE A
10:00 CUT OFF, OKAY.

22:29.733 --> 22:31.533
IT SEEMS REASONABLE,
A 10:00 CUT OFF.

22:31.567 --> 22:32.733
PLEASE RESPECT THAT.

22:32.767 --> 22:34.533
AND, WHILE I'M ON
THE SUBJECT,

22:34.567 --> 22:36.067
WHO IS THIS SCHMUCK,
FUCK-FACED LAWYER

22:36.100 --> 22:37.633
YOU SET US
UP WITH ?!

22:37.667 --> 22:40.100
I COULD SEE HOW ONE
COULD INTERPRET THAT

22:40.133 --> 22:41.500
AS A SERIOUS ERROR
IN JUDGMENT.

22:41.533 --> 22:43.500
I WOULD SAY THAT
THAT'S QUITE CORRECT.

22:43.533 --> 22:45.267
I WOULD SAY THAT'S
EVEN AN UNDERSTATEMENT

22:45.300 --> 22:46.533
BECAUSE THAT GUY
IS COSTING US,

22:46.567 --> 22:47.867
HOW MUCH
MONEY, JEFF ?

22:47.900 --> 22:49.533
HOW MUCH IS
HE COSTING US ?

22:49.567 --> 22:51.067
LARRY, SHOULD I BE
UPSET ABOUT THIS ?

22:51.100 --> 22:52.767
THEY'RE JUST THINGS, WE
CAN REPLACE ALL OF THEM.

22:52.800 --> 22:53.900
WE CAN REPLACE
EVERYTHING.

22:53.933 --> 22:55.133
THERE'S THINGS
WE CAN'T REPLACE.

22:55.167 --> 22:56.467
WHAT ABOUT
MY GRANDMOTHER'S BROOCH,

22:56.500 --> 22:57.500
THAT SHE BROUGHT
OVER FROM RUSSIA ?

22:57.533 --> 22:58.733
DID HE TAKE IT ?

22:58.767 --> 23:00.267
I'M GONNA GO CHECK
THAT RIGHT NOW.

23:00.300 --> 23:02.633
SHE BROUGHT IT OVER
FROM RUSSIA FROM A POGROM.

23:02.667 --> 23:03.733
SHE WAS
IN STEERAGE.

23:03.767 --> 23:05.667
IF THAT'S GONE,
I'M GONNA BE HYSTERICAL.

23:05.700 --> 23:08.233
SHE WORKED HARD
ALL HER LIFE

23:08.267 --> 23:09.967
TO GIVE THAT TO ME !

23:11.733 --> 23:13.067
I'M SORRY YOU
WALKED IN ON THAT.

23:13.100 --> 23:14.467
NO, NO,
DON'T, PLEASE.

23:14.500 --> 23:15.467
GOODBYE.

23:15.500 --> 23:17.567
NO, NO, PLEASE,
I'M BEGGING YOU.

23:17.600 --> 23:18.767
JUST STAY HERE.

23:18.800 --> 23:19.767
I CAN'T STAY HERE.

23:19.800 --> 23:21.067
NO, NO, TRUST ME.

23:21.067 --> 23:23.300
THAT FUCKING BROOCH
BETTER NOT BE MISSING.

23:23.333 --> 23:25.100
( Susie )
IT'S GONE !

23:25.133 --> 23:27.800
IT'S GONE, YOU FUCKING,
MOTHERFUCKING !

23:27.833 --> 23:28.833
I'LL KILL YOU, JEFF !

23:28.867 --> 23:30.200
YOU'RE A COCKSUCKER

23:30.233 --> 23:31.500
MOTHERFUCKER !

23:31.533 --> 23:33.933
MY GRANDMOTHER'S BROOCH
IS MISSING.

23:33.967 --> 23:35.833
I COULD NOT
REPLACE THIS ITEM.

23:35.867 --> 23:38.267
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IF SOMETHING
YOU CARED ABOUT WAS MISSING ?

23:38.300 --> 23:40.233
YOU DON'T GIVE A SHIT
ABOUT ANYTHING !

23:40.267 --> 23:41.300
MY BASEBALL CARDS.

23:41.333 --> 23:43.800
ALRIGHT, SEE, NOW,
IT'S NOT SO FUNNY ANYMORE.

23:43.833 --> 23:46.333
MICKEY MANTLE
MIGHT NOT BE THERE.

23:46.367 --> 23:48.067
( yelling )

23:50.167 --> 23:51.500
( Jeff )
WILL YOU SHUT UP ?

23:51.533 --> 23:53.067
( Susie )
OH, FUCK YOU !

23:58.933 --> 24:00.067
LARRY ?

24:00.067 --> 24:01.633
HEY !

24:01.667 --> 24:02.633
HEY.

24:02.667 --> 24:03.700
OOH, OOH,
STAY RIGHT THERE.

24:03.733 --> 24:04.733
I WANNA SHOW
YOU SOMETHING.

24:04.767 --> 24:05.767
YOU GOT MY PAD ?

24:05.800 --> 24:06.867
NO, NO, NO,
IT'S EVEN BETTER.

24:06.900 --> 24:08.133
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
BELIEVE THIS.

24:08.167 --> 24:10.233
I WENT BY THAT
JEWELRY STORE ON WILSHIRE

24:10.267 --> 24:12.433
AND I FOUND
THAT BRACELET.

24:12.467 --> 24:13.500
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT ?

24:13.533 --> 24:14.533
THIS THING ?

24:14.567 --> 24:15.567
YEAH, IS THAT
UNBELIEVABLE ?

24:15.600 --> 24:16.700
THE SAME STORE
ON WILSHIRE ?

24:16.733 --> 24:18.567
THAT'S WHERE JULIA...
I DON'T GET IT.

24:18.600 --> 24:20.233
I WAS SO EXCITED,
I BOUGHT IT RIGHT THERE.

24:20.267 --> 24:21.567
WHAT ARE THEY,
KNOCKING THESE THINGS OFF ?

24:21.600 --> 24:22.567
LISTEN, I'VE GOT
TO GET RUNNING.

24:22.600 --> 24:23.600
I'VE GOT A MEETING.

24:23.633 --> 24:24.733
WILL YOU PUT
THAT AWAY FROM ME ?

24:24.767 --> 24:26.067
YOU KNOW, I CAN'T FIND
THAT PAD ANYWHERE.

24:26.067 --> 24:27.100
OH, NO.

24:27.133 --> 24:28.500
I WENT TO STARBUCKS,
THEY DON'T HAVE IT.

24:28.533 --> 24:29.500
I WENT TO
THE GAS STATION.

24:29.533 --> 24:31.333
I'LL HELP YOU LOOK
WHEN I GET BACK, BYE.

24:31.367 --> 24:32.667
BYE.

24:39.667 --> 24:41.133
[ doorbell ]

24:44.400 --> 24:45.433
HEY.

24:45.467 --> 24:46.467
HI.

24:46.500 --> 24:47.500
HI, COME ON IN.

24:47.533 --> 24:48.533
HOW ARE YOU ?

24:48.567 --> 24:49.567
GOOD.

24:49.600 --> 24:50.633
HOW YOU DOING ?

24:50.667 --> 24:52.167
I'M OKAY, OKAY.

24:52.200 --> 24:57.233
LISTEN, I AM SO SORRY
ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

24:57.267 --> 24:58.767
THAT WAS JUST
SO INSANE,

24:58.800 --> 25:00.933
I COMPLETELY
APOLOGIZE.

25:00.967 --> 25:01.967
THAT WAS CRAZY.

25:02.067 --> 25:04.233
BUT, THAT PAD IS
JUST SO IMPORTANT.

25:04.267 --> 25:06.500
IT HAS, LIKE, NINE MONTHS
OF IDEAS IN THERE...

25:06.533 --> 25:08.667
LIKE I HAVE WASTED
NINE MONTHS OF MY LIFE...

25:08.700 --> 25:11.633
WHEN YOU WERE LOOKING
AROUND LAST NIGHT,

25:11.667 --> 25:15.500
DID YOU SEE
MY BRACELET ?

25:15.533 --> 25:17.333
BECAUSE I CAN'T
FIND MY BRACELET.

25:17.367 --> 25:19.133
YOU KNOW THE BRACELET
THAT YOU LIKE ?

25:19.167 --> 25:20.700
YEAH.

25:20.733 --> 25:22.533
YOU DIDN'T SEE IT ?

25:24.833 --> 25:27.333
NO, BUT YOU KNOW
WHAT'S INTERESTING,

25:27.367 --> 25:29.667
CHERYL ACTUALLY,
WAS JUST...

25:31.400 --> 25:35.200
JESUS CHRIST.

25:35.233 --> 25:36.800
THIS REALLY LOOKS BAD,
I KNOW IT DOES.

25:36.833 --> 25:37.967
THIS IS MY BRACELET.

25:38.067 --> 25:39.700
CHERYL BOUGHT THE SAME
BRACELET THAT YOU...

25:39.733 --> 25:40.867
OH, LARRY.

25:40.900 --> 25:42.367
JULIA, I SWEAR
TO YOU, I DIDN'T.

25:42.400 --> 25:43.967
WHY ARE YOU
DOING THIS ?

25:44.067 --> 25:46.133
I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING,
I DIDN'T TAKE YOUR BRACELET.

25:46.167 --> 25:47.433
THAT'S CHERYL'S
BRACELET, JULIA.

25:47.467 --> 25:49.367
YOU KEEP
THE BRACELET NOW.

25:49.400 --> 25:51.067
I DON'T WANT IT
IN MY HOUSE.

25:51.100 --> 25:53.567
HEY, DEAN,
COME ON IN.

25:53.600 --> 25:56.167
DEAN, LOOK, IT'S
JULIA LOUIS-DREYFUS.

25:56.200 --> 25:57.367
REMEMBER ?
THIS IS DEAN !

25:57.400 --> 25:59.200
WE WENT OVER HIS
HOUSE THE OTHER DAY.

25:59.233 --> 26:00.300
IT'S JULIA.

26:00.333 --> 26:01.300
THIS IS FANTASTIC.

26:01.333 --> 26:03.700
I CAN'T BELIEVE
WE'RE ACTUALLY MEETING.

26:03.733 --> 26:04.900
LIKE, THIS IS GREAT.

26:04.933 --> 26:06.967
YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO COME THE OTHER DAY

26:07.067 --> 26:08.367
AND YOU DIDN'T
SHOW UP ?

26:08.400 --> 26:10.400
OKAY, CAN I TELL YOU
SOMETHING, MY FRIEND ?

26:10.433 --> 26:13.633
WHEN YOU MAKE
APPOINTMENTS,
KEEP IT !

26:13.667 --> 26:16.200
BECAUSE NOW I'M BUSY, AND
I CAN'T TALK TO YOU ANYMORE.

26:16.233 --> 26:17.233
JULIA...

26:17.267 --> 26:19.100
KEEP YOUR
APPOINTMENTS !

26:23.467 --> 26:25.267
I THINK I'M NAUSEOUS.

26:25.300 --> 26:27.633
SHE'S CERTAINLY A LOT
DIFFERENT ON TELEVISION.

26:27.667 --> 26:29.533
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT,
SHE'S MAD AT ME, NOT YOU.

26:29.567 --> 26:30.900
DON'T TAKE
THAT PERSONALLY.

26:30.933 --> 26:33.900
THAT HAS NOTHING,
NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU.

26:33.933 --> 26:35.633
OKAY, NOTHING !

26:35.667 --> 26:37.067
IT'S ME.

26:37.100 --> 26:39.433
THE POINT IS
YOU MET HER.

26:39.467 --> 26:41.533
YOU MET
JULIA LOUIS-DREYFUS.

26:41.567 --> 26:43.633
COME ON,
YOU MET JULIA.

26:43.667 --> 26:45.200
THAT'S WHAT YOU WANTED,
YOU MET HER.

26:45.233 --> 26:46.700
ISN'T THAT
FANTASTIC ?

26:46.733 --> 26:48.300
I THINK
THAT'S GREAT.

26:48.333 --> 26:49.567
THAT WAS TERRIBLE.

26:49.600 --> 26:51.700
THAT WAS LIKE,
MAYBE AN ENCOUNTER,

26:51.733 --> 26:53.967
BUT, THAT'S NOT
A MEETING.

26:54.067 --> 26:56.067
I DON'T WHAT
YOU'RE QUIBBLING
ABOUT SEMANTICS HERE.

26:56.067 --> 26:57.400
YOU DID MEET HER.

26:57.433 --> 26:59.100
IT WAS AN
UNPLEASANT MEETING,

26:59.133 --> 27:00.833
IT WASN'T
A LONG MEETING,

27:00.867 --> 27:04.067
BUT IT WAS,
NEVERTHELESS,
A MEETING.

27:04.067 --> 27:07.400
OKAY, WE HAVE,
A DIVERGENCE OF OPINION.

27:07.433 --> 27:09.200
THIS HAPPENS ALL
THE TIME IN LAW.

27:09.233 --> 27:11.067
IT'S LIKE, ONE PERSON
SEES IT ONE WAY,

27:11.067 --> 27:12.300
ANOTHER PERSON
SEES IT ANOTHER WAY.

27:12.333 --> 27:13.433
YOU SAW THAT
AS A MEETING.

27:13.467 --> 27:15.800
I JUST SAW THAT AS
A HORRIBLE MOMENT IN MY LIFE.

27:15.833 --> 27:17.833
OKAY, GET OUT.

27:19.867 --> 27:22.067
WELL, THERE WAS
A REASON I CAME OVER.

27:22.067 --> 27:23.067
THANK YOU.

27:23.100 --> 27:24.367
I FOUND THIS.

27:28.067 --> 27:30.633
DOES THAT LOOK FAMILIAR
AT ALL TO YOU ?

27:30.667 --> 27:31.833
IS THAT...

27:31.867 --> 27:32.933
YEAH, WHERE'D
YOU GET THIS ?

27:32.967 --> 27:34.233
IT WAS IN MY HOUSE.

27:34.267 --> 27:36.067
IT WAS UNDER A CUSHION
BY THE CHAIR.

27:38.533 --> 27:40.100
I WAS JUST WONDERING
IF THAT WAS YOURS.

27:40.133 --> 27:42.967
YEAH, THANK YOU,
THANK YOU.

27:43.067 --> 27:44.833
THERE'S A REWARD
INVOLVED IN THAT.

27:44.867 --> 27:47.500
JUST LOOK RIGHT IN
THE FRONT PART.

27:47.533 --> 27:51.667
IT SAYS $500 TO THE PERSON
WHO RETURNS THIS TO L. DAVID.

27:51.700 --> 27:55.067
I PUT TWO AND TWO TOGETHER AND
THOUGHT THE "L" STOOD FOR LARRY.

27:55.067 --> 27:56.100
IS THAT RIGHT ?

27:56.133 --> 27:57.400
I'LL GET A CHECK,
SHERLOCK.

27:57.433 --> 27:59.067
PERFECT, CHECK IS FINE.

27:59.100 --> 28:00.733
MAYBE YOU CAN GET YOURSELF
A NEW SWEATER.

28:01.733 --> 28:03.900
IT'S "EI"

28:05.333 --> 28:07.300
WEINSTOCK.
