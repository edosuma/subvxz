WEBVTT

00:19.352 --> 00:22.313
-All right, you ready to hear this?
-No, but go on.

00:22.897 --> 00:26.026
So, I'm walkin' along the High Line
on my way to dinner

00:26.109 --> 00:27.569
just to get a little hit of nature.

00:27.652 --> 00:29.696
Plus, it's my secret shortcut
in that part of town.

00:29.779 --> 00:32.741
I don't need a tour guide.
You're on the High Line, and then?

00:32.824 --> 00:37.245
And I'm passing all these expensive
new condos, thinking, "You know what?"

00:37.328 --> 00:39.706
<i>"You really must be a exhibitionist</i>
<i>to live in one of these."</i>

00:39.789 --> 00:42.751
<i>It's like a storefront window in Amsterdam</i>
<i>where prostitutes advertise.</i>

00:42.834 --> 00:46.212
Not that I'm judgin' prostitutes.
A girl gotta do what a girl gotta do.

00:46.296 --> 00:48.131
-Suzanne!
-Right.

00:48.214 --> 00:50.550
So just as I had that thought,

00:51.051 --> 00:53.803
I see Colin in one of these apartments

00:53.887 --> 00:56.347
carryin' a bunch of movin' boxes

00:56.431 --> 00:57.932
with Tyler.

01:08.151 --> 01:10.195
Colin left me for Tyler?

01:10.278 --> 01:13.823
Oh God, I wish I didn't see it. I'm always
seein' shit I shouldn't be seein'.

01:13.907 --> 01:16.576
I can't even get on a subway
without a penis in my face.

01:16.659 --> 01:20.246
Do you have any idea
what a cliché move this is?

01:20.330 --> 01:21.623
He is half Colin's age.

01:21.706 --> 01:24.584
Yeah, it's the same thing
men have been doin' to women forever.

01:24.667 --> 01:27.420
Who knew gay guys
were just as awful as straight guys?

01:27.504 --> 01:28.963
Yeah, just with better haircuts.

01:29.047 --> 01:31.591
Wait, how does Colin even know Tyler?

01:31.674 --> 01:32.926
I have no id--

01:35.053 --> 01:36.846
-Oh my God.
-What?

01:36.930 --> 01:39.349
They met at our company Christmas party
this past year.

01:39.432 --> 01:42.060
-I fucking introduced them.

01:42.143 --> 01:47.565
And later that night, we were looking
at Tyler's Instagram account together

01:47.649 --> 01:51.361
and laughing
at his ridiculously thirsty selfies.

01:51.444 --> 01:53.404
You know what? It sounds like you two

01:53.488 --> 01:55.740
have a lot to discuss
at your next therapy session.

01:55.824 --> 01:57.784
Oh, no, no, we are done with therapy.

01:58.618 --> 02:02.080
Colin texted me
that there is "nothing more to work on,"

02:02.163 --> 02:03.456
and now I know why.

02:03.540 --> 02:06.251
-Oh, baby, I am so sorry.
-Huh.

02:07.752 --> 02:09.754
-Ugh.
-Ooh…

02:11.256 --> 02:13.091
What are you doing? Wait, what--

02:13.174 --> 02:16.052
-I have to let him know that I know.
-Oh, no, no, no. No. Give me that.

02:16.136 --> 02:17.637
-Are you kidding?
-Give me this!

02:17.720 --> 02:20.265
No angry texts, no drunk texts,
no communication at all.

02:20.348 --> 02:22.433
It makes you look weak.
Plus, it doesn't work.

02:22.517 --> 02:24.811
If it did, I'd be married
eight times by now.

02:24.894 --> 02:26.104
-Look.

02:26.187 --> 02:29.107
I'm putting together
the presentation for Claire Lewis.

02:29.691 --> 02:32.694
Are you still gonna be okay
to show Chrystie Street tomorrow?

02:32.777 --> 02:34.737
If not, you know I got you, right?

02:34.821 --> 02:36.906
Thanks, but I need
to be working right now.

02:36.990 --> 02:39.284
Work is what's going to keep me sane.

02:39.367 --> 02:42.745
All right, well, this may sound crazy
right about now, but…

02:43.496 --> 02:45.832
-I really do believe in you and Colin.

02:47.375 --> 02:48.585
He's a Scorpio, right?

02:48.668 --> 02:49.919
Yeah, why?

02:50.003 --> 02:54.632
Child, please, Scorpios can never make up
their mind. You watch. He'll be back.

04:59.924 --> 05:00.800
No.

05:02.135 --> 05:03.678
No! No…

05:04.345 --> 05:06.014
No!

05:16.858 --> 05:19.027
-F--

05:22.947 --> 05:24.574
-Michael.
-Oh, hey, Diane, I'm really--

05:24.657 --> 05:28.077
Colin's <i>Architectural Digest</i>
ended up in my box again.

05:28.161 --> 05:30.121
You know why I keep getting his magazines?

05:30.204 --> 05:32.206
-Why?
-Because you boys don't check your box.

05:32.290 --> 05:35.835
And he's got an issue of <i>The Economist</i>
just sittin' there on the ledge.

05:35.918 --> 05:37.378
It's a common area.

05:37.462 --> 05:40.506
Is he really so busy
that he can't fetch his mail?

05:42.592 --> 05:43.426
I got it.

05:43.509 --> 05:46.012
If he wants last month's issue,
it's in my bathroom.

05:46.596 --> 05:47.722
Kidding.

06:22.757 --> 06:23.758
Michael!

06:25.760 --> 06:27.387
We've been here 15 minutes.

06:28.513 --> 06:31.099
Is everything okay? Are you crying?

06:31.682 --> 06:35.103
Oh, I'm fine. Allergies.
I'm so sorry to be late.

06:35.978 --> 06:38.272
It's a little rude, but we waited.

06:39.482 --> 06:40.358
Thank you.

06:44.112 --> 06:49.325
So two split bedrooms,
two full baths, and we are on the A line,

06:49.409 --> 06:51.577
which is the best layout in the building.

06:52.829 --> 06:55.248
It also has newly upgraded windows,

06:55.331 --> 06:58.292
per a recent building assessment
that you are not responsible for.

06:58.376 --> 06:59.293
Why are they moving?

06:59.377 --> 07:01.671
They have one child
and another on the way,

07:01.754 --> 07:04.632
so they are moving into something bigger
in New Jersey.

07:05.258 --> 07:06.467
Oh, how sad.

07:07.468 --> 07:10.304
I grew up in New Jersey,
so I feel your pain.

07:11.514 --> 07:13.099
Where are you guys moving from?

07:13.599 --> 07:17.061
We live separately in Brooklyn.
This would be our first place together.

07:18.062 --> 07:19.021
Huh!

07:19.605 --> 07:20.898
That is so major.

07:22.108 --> 07:25.278
It really is the best feeling in the world

07:25.361 --> 07:28.781
to both find something that you love
together and then call it your home.

07:29.699 --> 07:31.951
-Home is where the heart is.
-Exactly.

07:32.618 --> 07:33.995
And where it should stay.

07:35.705 --> 07:37.874
Do you mind
if we wander around on our own?

07:37.957 --> 07:39.333
Yeah, yeah. Take your time.

07:43.045 --> 07:44.755
How's your hot husband?

07:46.966 --> 07:48.217
Fine. Why?

07:48.301 --> 07:50.761
I'm just asking. You got really lucky.

07:59.228 --> 08:00.480
Stop!

08:03.774 --> 08:06.819
It's not even officially
on the market yet.

08:06.903 --> 08:09.238
It's an estate sale.
The family just wants to get rid of it.

08:09.322 --> 08:11.657
-That's why it's so cheap.
-Did somebody die in here?

08:11.741 --> 08:15.286
-No, they'd have to disclose it.
-Good. You know I'm afraid of ghosts.

08:15.369 --> 08:19.957
Well, if I see any,
I will invite them out to…

08:21.209 --> 08:22.418
-…our terrace!

08:22.502 --> 08:24.170
-Wow!
-I know!

08:24.754 --> 08:27.590
So I ran the numbers,
and if we both break open our piggy banks

08:27.673 --> 08:29.383
and scrape together the down payment,

08:29.467 --> 08:31.552
our monthly would be cheaper
than living apart.

08:33.095 --> 08:35.932
You gonna make me throw dinner parties
and have game nights and friends?

08:36.015 --> 08:36.974
Yes.

08:37.808 --> 08:38.976
Good.

08:39.060 --> 08:40.645
-Okay.

08:40.728 --> 08:42.313
-Hmm?
-Mm.

08:49.195 --> 08:52.323
I bet your husband has some hot friends.
Fix me up.

08:57.453 --> 08:59.413
I think they're going to make an offer.

09:00.206 --> 09:03.334
You'll have to get 'em up to two.
We already turned down 1.9.

09:03.417 --> 09:05.670
-When?
-Last month. They don't need the money.

09:05.753 --> 09:08.548
Everyone needs the money.
Except maybe you don't.

09:09.048 --> 09:11.092
With your hot, rich husband.

09:11.175 --> 09:15.555
We have our own separate bank accounts.
It's not any of your fuckin' business.

09:15.638 --> 09:18.474
Why so touchy?
I was just making conversation.

09:18.558 --> 09:20.393
It's really nice.

09:20.893 --> 09:23.396
Can we have a minute to sit here
and feel the vibe of the place?

09:23.479 --> 09:28.109
Sure, yeah. Take all the time you need.
I'll wait for you in here.

10:05.938 --> 10:07.565
Motherfucker!

10:08.316 --> 10:11.444
We're leaving, but they love it.
I'll see if I can nudge them up to two.

10:12.486 --> 10:13.571
I like them.

10:14.780 --> 10:16.657
I'd really like to see them get this.

10:18.159 --> 10:19.327
I don't trust you.

10:19.410 --> 10:21.787
Is there something
wrong with the apartment? Noise?

10:21.871 --> 10:23.623
Mice? A bad smell?

10:23.706 --> 10:25.082
It's better you tell me now.

10:25.166 --> 10:26.709
Nothing, I promise.

10:27.585 --> 10:29.670
I'm just rooting for love.

10:38.137 --> 10:39.597
This is who Colin left me for.

10:39.680 --> 10:40.514
Oh!

10:40.598 --> 10:42.099
He's cute. How old is he?

10:42.183 --> 10:46.562
He's not cute. He's diabolical.
And that blond hair looks like a dye job.

10:46.646 --> 10:49.940
I wonder how I'd look with blond hair.
It would really pop on screen.

10:51.233 --> 10:52.943
So how did you find out?

10:53.027 --> 10:56.197
Suzanne. She saw them together
moving into Colin's new apartment.

10:56.280 --> 10:58.157
What kind of friend
tells you these things?

10:58.240 --> 11:00.368
What, was she gonna not tell me?
She saw them.

11:00.451 --> 11:02.370
Is that the hot guy you hate from work?

11:02.870 --> 11:04.538
-I think I follow him.
-Unfollow him.

11:04.622 --> 11:07.083
This is from our company's
Christmas party. I introduced them.

11:07.166 --> 11:08.292
-That's cold.

11:08.376 --> 11:10.711
-Having an affair with someone from work.
-Not an affair.

11:10.795 --> 11:13.381
He left me for Tyler,
then didn't have the balls to admit it.

11:13.464 --> 11:15.466
But it's good Colin's with a young guy.

11:15.549 --> 11:18.010
Let him have his middle-aged fling.

11:18.094 --> 11:20.554
He will quickly realize
that having a twink boyfriend

11:20.638 --> 11:23.641
is a shallow, empty life
that leads nowhere.

11:23.724 --> 11:24.600
No offense.

11:24.684 --> 11:27.687
Actually, it leads to a life
of mind-blowing sex.

11:28.270 --> 11:30.523
-You remember sex, don't you?
-Vaguely.

11:31.232 --> 11:32.608
And you're really not helping.

11:32.692 --> 11:33.776
Our company has a table

11:33.859 --> 11:36.112
at the Central Park
Conservancy dinner tomorrow.

11:36.195 --> 11:37.446
Tyler is gonna be there.

11:37.530 --> 11:40.658
I'm afraid I might
stick a steak knife in his neck.

11:40.741 --> 11:42.493
That's a nice butch fantasy.

11:42.576 --> 11:46.539
But what you should do
is just play it cool until it fizzles out.

11:46.622 --> 11:47.456
Really?

11:48.833 --> 11:50.751
You really don't think it's over?

11:50.835 --> 11:53.629
No. I do not think it's over.

11:53.713 --> 11:56.799
I agree. Couples break up
and get back together all the time.

11:57.299 --> 11:59.009
-Look at the Jonathans.
-That's right.

11:59.093 --> 12:01.554
They broke up
for a couple months a few years ago

12:01.637 --> 12:03.472
when Jonathan had that thing with Jorge,

12:03.556 --> 12:06.475
the Mexican travel agent
who he thought looked like Ricky Martin.

12:06.559 --> 12:08.561
He almost moved to Puerto Vallarta.

12:08.644 --> 12:10.187
I thought he just loved it there.

12:10.271 --> 12:11.814
You can like it for two weeks.

12:11.897 --> 12:14.066
Then it's like being trapped
at a gay quinceañera.

12:14.150 --> 12:17.153
The point is it was a fling.

12:17.236 --> 12:19.363
He got it out of his system,
and they're back together.

12:19.447 --> 12:20.948
Thanks. That does give me some hope.

12:21.031 --> 12:23.492
Okay, this is starting to sound
like a cautionary tale.

12:23.576 --> 12:25.828
Please, do not have a baby with Colin.

12:25.911 --> 12:27.663
I'll have nobody left
to go to dinner with.

12:27.747 --> 12:31.375
Exactly. And we're too old
to find a new friend.

12:44.180 --> 12:46.557
-Hey, Jack. Hey, Millie.

12:50.644 --> 12:53.606
I really am sorry about you and Colin.

12:53.689 --> 12:54.732
What do you mean?

12:55.691 --> 12:56.942
Didn't you split up?

12:58.027 --> 13:00.946
-What makes you think that?
-The boxes, the suitcases.

13:01.030 --> 13:02.573
The U-Haul parked out front.

13:03.282 --> 13:06.494
Some hot little number was helping him.

13:06.577 --> 13:10.122
It looked like the beginning
of one of my favorite poems,

13:10.206 --> 13:11.665
<i>Pack My Box. </i>

13:12.166 --> 13:14.293
I still have the VHS somewhere.

13:15.419 --> 13:17.046
-If you want to check it out.
-Oh, thanks.

13:17.129 --> 13:20.800
My VCR was stolen in 1992.

13:21.300 --> 13:22.259
Anyway,

13:23.093 --> 13:24.929
I don't care what people say.

13:25.012 --> 13:27.848
I always thought
you were the good-looking one.

13:29.558 --> 13:30.518
Thank you?

13:33.145 --> 13:34.647
Did he say anything to you?

13:34.730 --> 13:35.564
Yes.

13:35.648 --> 13:36.982
"Goodbye." Hah!

13:37.983 --> 13:39.985
-Don't you just hate men?

13:51.956 --> 13:54.416
Is Colin ever going to pick up
his <i>Wall Street Journal,</i>

13:54.500 --> 13:56.252
or is he just gonna let them pile up?

13:56.335 --> 13:57.586
I'll take care of it.

14:08.305 --> 14:10.224
Happy Central Park Conservancy.

14:10.808 --> 14:13.853
Well, whatever you are selling tonight,
I am buying.

14:13.936 --> 14:16.689
-You're not exactly my customer.
-Ha-ha!

14:16.772 --> 14:19.066
-Uh, thought you might need this.
-Why?

14:19.692 --> 14:20.651
Good news, bad news.

14:20.734 --> 14:22.987
-Bad news first.
-Tyler's sitting next to you.

14:23.070 --> 14:25.155
Ugh. And did he bring his new boyfriend?

14:25.239 --> 14:27.700
No. He doesn't have a plus-one.
None of us do.

14:28.200 --> 14:30.578
But now for some better news.
Claire Lewis is here.

14:30.661 --> 14:31.745
Did you talk to her?

14:31.829 --> 14:34.915
I started to, but then she just
handed me her empty champagne glass

14:34.999 --> 14:36.458
and said, "I'll take another, dear."

14:36.542 --> 14:37.710
Where is she?

14:37.793 --> 14:39.920
Inside, bidding on the silent auction.

14:40.004 --> 14:42.423
I'm gonna go say hi
and tell her how excited we are

14:42.506 --> 14:44.842
-about selling her apartment.
-Mm! Nice.

14:46.635 --> 14:47.469
Thank you.

14:48.220 --> 14:49.847
No, no. That's for Claire.

14:52.558 --> 14:54.435
Claire! Michael Lawson.

14:54.518 --> 14:55.936
I'm sorry. Do I know you?

14:56.020 --> 14:57.980
Michael Lawson, Stanley's friend?

14:58.731 --> 15:01.525
Uh, broker who came to see
your beautiful home.

15:01.609 --> 15:06.238
Oh! Yes. I'm sorry, the broker.
There have been so many of those.

15:06.989 --> 15:09.158
And you're wearing a tux.

15:09.241 --> 15:11.619
You know, all men look the same in a tux.

15:11.702 --> 15:14.872
Every time I see a fat ass
in a monkey suit, I think it's my husband.

15:17.791 --> 15:19.668
-You bidding on something?
-Ah!

15:19.752 --> 15:22.046
A week at the Amanyara
in Turks and Caicos.

15:22.129 --> 15:24.882
-Ah.
-I thought I could bring my daughter.

15:25.424 --> 15:29.011
Although she doesn't want me to call her
my daughter since she's nonbinary now.

15:29.094 --> 15:32.014
Actually, the idea
of sharing a room with her,

15:32.097 --> 15:34.391
I mean them, excuse me,

15:35.017 --> 15:36.810
would be the opposite of a vacation.

15:37.561 --> 15:42.942
But maybe I'll have a new love in my life
by the "one-year expiration date."

15:43.025 --> 15:45.235
"Breakfast and airfare not included."

15:45.319 --> 15:47.738
-I'm sure you will.
-Right.

15:47.821 --> 15:50.616
And maybe I'll also have a unicorn
that shits money.

15:52.284 --> 15:54.495
My partner and I are excited

15:54.578 --> 15:58.207
to be showing you the presentation
we put together for your apartment.

15:58.290 --> 16:01.794
Um, your timing of the market
is just top-notch.

16:01.877 --> 16:04.880
Well, I've always been known
for my perfect timing.

16:06.048 --> 16:07.424
Right as he left,

16:07.508 --> 16:11.095
I asked my husband why he started
shaving his balls all of a sudden.

16:11.178 --> 16:13.639
Did he want them
to match his hairless head?

16:13.722 --> 16:15.140
Do you know what he said to me?

16:16.058 --> 16:18.519
"I'm so glad you asked, Claire."

16:18.602 --> 16:21.188
"Perfect timing. I did it for Layla."

16:22.940 --> 16:25.442
-This is where you say, "Who's Layla?"
-Oh.

16:26.110 --> 16:26.944
Who's Layla?

16:27.027 --> 16:29.405
His 25-year-old Pilates instructor

16:29.488 --> 16:33.409
with whom he's decided to spend
the second half of his life.

16:33.492 --> 16:34.952
The second half!

16:35.035 --> 16:38.914
Because clinically obese men
often live to 130.

16:43.252 --> 16:45.796
-Where are you sitting?
-Oh, over there with some friends.

16:46.296 --> 16:48.966
My shrink told me
it's important for me to start going out,

16:49.049 --> 16:53.262
even when I don't feel like it,
which is what I am doing here.

16:53.804 --> 16:55.472
Well, I'm glad that you are,

16:55.556 --> 16:57.474
-because you look amazing.

16:57.558 --> 17:03.605
And you should not be denying the world
the pleasure of you.

17:03.689 --> 17:05.441
You've already got the meeting.

17:06.734 --> 17:09.737
-I'm gonna go find my table.
-All right. Have a great evening.

17:10.320 --> 17:11.864
Don't outbid me now.

17:11.947 --> 17:13.949
I promise not to.

17:28.172 --> 17:29.214
Adopt a bench,

17:29.298 --> 17:33.260
dedicate a paving stone,
donate flowers, endow a tree.

17:33.343 --> 17:34.720
There are so many ways

17:34.803 --> 17:37.723
to support this glorious park
that belongs to all New Yorkers.

17:37.806 --> 17:40.184
Now, please, enjoy your meal.

17:41.935 --> 17:45.189
-Looks like Tyler is a no-show.
-Yeah, no surprise.

17:45.272 --> 17:47.649
-He doesn't wanna face me.

17:47.733 --> 17:49.985
But he can't keep running forever.

17:50.069 --> 17:54.239
You'd be amazed the lengths
people will go to avoid confrontation.

17:54.323 --> 17:56.617
-Textbook narcissistic behavior.
-Yeah!

17:56.700 --> 18:00.079
Some will even secretly
move their things out of your apartment

18:00.162 --> 18:02.289
before breaking up with you.

18:04.249 --> 18:05.542
Ugh.

18:06.043 --> 18:07.127
There he is.

18:09.838 --> 18:13.092
I'm sure that he saw me
and now he's afraid to come to our table.

18:16.095 --> 18:18.055
-No.
-What are you doing?

18:18.138 --> 18:20.349
I gotta talk to him.
I mean, that is bullshit, right?

18:20.432 --> 18:22.935
-Not here. You've been drinking all night.
-Let go of me.

18:23.018 --> 18:24.728
Don't get into a fight
at a charity event.

18:24.812 --> 18:26.647
-It's tacky.
-Stop handling my--

18:26.730 --> 18:28.899
You can't possibly know
how to fight! Gah--

18:34.655 --> 18:36.615
Tyler! Tyler.

18:37.491 --> 18:38.408
Hello, Michael.

18:38.492 --> 18:40.786
I'd really like to know
exactly when this started.

18:40.869 --> 18:41.703
When what started?

18:41.787 --> 18:44.790
Please. You know you're avoiding me.

18:44.873 --> 18:47.251
You're too much of a coward
to sit in your own seat.

18:47.334 --> 18:49.044
I'm sitting with my mother.

18:49.128 --> 18:52.214
She's a co-host of this event,
and we have our own table.

18:52.297 --> 18:56.135
The only reason Empire Realty
bought a table is thanks to me.

18:56.218 --> 18:57.261
That's why you're here.

18:57.344 --> 18:59.888
I know what's going on with you and Colin.

18:59.972 --> 19:03.433
My neighbor saw you
helping him move out of my building.

19:03.517 --> 19:06.854
I thought Colin not telling you
about me might make things awkward.

19:06.937 --> 19:09.398
"Awkward"? Are you fucking kidding me?

19:10.274 --> 19:14.570
You break up my relationship,
and you think it might be awkward?

19:14.653 --> 19:16.655
What the hell are you talking about?

19:16.738 --> 19:18.157
I'm sorry Colin left you,

19:18.240 --> 19:21.535
but the only thing going on between us
is that I found an apartment for him.

19:21.618 --> 19:24.163
Wh-- And you expect me to believe that?

19:24.246 --> 19:27.833
Suzanne saw you with him in his apartment
on the High Line, dude.

19:27.916 --> 19:30.002
I helped him move a few things in.

19:30.085 --> 19:33.172
I provide that level of service
to all of my clients.

19:33.255 --> 19:35.215
It's called going the extra mile.

19:35.299 --> 19:37.926
-I--
-But I am not having an affair with Colin.

19:40.012 --> 19:40.846
He's old.

19:41.513 --> 19:43.891
Not that old. A few years older than me.

19:43.974 --> 19:45.309
Really? You're the younger one?

19:46.935 --> 19:50.564
Look, if it makes you feel any better,
I've seen no evidence of another guy.

19:50.647 --> 19:53.066
I really don't think
he left you for anybody.

19:53.150 --> 19:56.278
I've gotta get to my table. Sorry.

19:57.571 --> 19:59.531
Oh, uh, one more thing.

19:59.615 --> 20:01.867
Would you stop
bugging Claire Lewis about her apartment?

20:02.659 --> 20:03.911
It's really embarrassing.

20:03.994 --> 20:06.997
I've told you before,
she's my mother's friend.

20:07.080 --> 20:08.498
I'm getting the listing.

20:17.591 --> 20:19.760
You look gorgeous enough
to make me straight tonight.

20:19.843 --> 20:21.553
Oh!

20:22.387 --> 20:24.181
You are so…

20:34.316 --> 20:36.151
-How'd it go?
-Ah…

20:37.611 --> 20:39.780
Colin's not having a fling.

20:41.406 --> 20:44.743
He didn't leave me for Tyler.
He didn't leave me for anyone.

20:45.994 --> 20:48.997
He just wanted to leave me.

20:51.208 --> 20:53.043
Which somehow feels even worse.

21:01.635 --> 21:03.262
It felt so satisfying

21:03.345 --> 21:06.390
to tell myself this story
that Colin left me for Tyler

21:06.473 --> 21:08.141
because it made him look so shallow,

21:08.225 --> 21:11.061
but really Tyler was just helping him
plot his escape

21:11.144 --> 21:13.480
like I was holding him hostage.

21:14.273 --> 21:16.984
I just don't know
what to do with all this anger.

21:17.484 --> 21:20.112
You know what?
You're gonna put it into your work.

21:20.612 --> 21:23.949
Wait until Claire sees the presentation
we put together for her.

21:24.032 --> 21:26.451
I don't care what kind of friend
she is to his mother.

21:26.535 --> 21:30.247
There's no way she's entrusting
her apartment to that millennial fraud.

21:30.330 --> 21:32.082
-Mm.
-We're not getting played on this one.

21:35.210 --> 21:36.044
Shit.

21:37.045 --> 21:40.132
"Unfortunately, Miss Lewis
is unable to meet with you at this time."

21:40.215 --> 21:42.009
"Thank you for your consideration."

21:42.592 --> 21:43.719
"Dictated, not read."

21:46.138 --> 21:47.014
We got played.

21:55.147 --> 21:56.189
Not this time.

22:01.653 --> 22:03.363
Excuse me, sorry. Emergency.

22:04.614 --> 22:05.866
71st and Park.

22:10.829 --> 22:11.663
Claire!

22:14.791 --> 22:15.876
Claire!

22:16.710 --> 22:20.088
Michael, what did I say
about loud voices in the lobby?

22:20.881 --> 22:21.715
I'm sorry.

22:23.258 --> 22:24.301
It's okay, Freddy.

22:25.719 --> 22:28.096
Claire, don't list your apartment
with Tyler.

22:28.847 --> 22:30.599
Nobody is going to work harder for you

22:30.682 --> 22:33.477
or understand more about
what you are going through than I will.

22:33.560 --> 22:37.606
Oh really? You?
You understand what I'm going through?

22:37.689 --> 22:40.108
Yes. I just got left, too,

22:40.192 --> 22:42.069
after 17 years.

22:42.152 --> 22:44.071
I don't even know what happened.

22:44.654 --> 22:48.492
And I am still looking
for any tiny excuse or stupid reason

22:48.575 --> 22:50.827
to make me believe that it's not real.

22:50.911 --> 22:52.120
But it is real.

22:54.289 --> 22:55.290
I got left

22:55.374 --> 22:58.293
by a man I thought I was gonna spend
the rest of my life with.

22:58.877 --> 23:01.421
Michael, I'm so sorry.

23:02.631 --> 23:04.966
But do you honestly think
it's the same thing?

23:05.050 --> 23:09.763
Do you have any idea what it's like to be
single again for a woman at my age?

23:10.389 --> 23:14.726
Do you have any idea what it's like to be
single again for a gay man at my age?

23:14.810 --> 23:16.019
I'm a dinosaur.

23:16.603 --> 23:17.771
You're still cute.

23:17.854 --> 23:19.231
You're still gorgeous!

23:24.528 --> 23:26.863
Tyler was taking six percent.

23:27.656 --> 23:29.991
Can you shave a point off your commission?

23:32.035 --> 23:33.578
Yeah, if that's what it takes.

23:33.662 --> 23:35.997
Oh! His mother's gonna be so pissed.

23:36.081 --> 23:39.668
It's gonna be worth it.
I am gonna work my ass off for you,

23:39.751 --> 23:41.962
and we're gonna have fun.

23:42.045 --> 23:44.965
Oh, good. I could use some fun.

23:46.258 --> 23:48.510
Uh, but, Michael, one more thing.

23:49.136 --> 23:53.348
If you're a man, I don't give a damn
how old you are or who you sleep with,

23:53.432 --> 23:54.891
you've still got a better deal.

23:56.309 --> 23:58.520
Just admit it. Admit it.

24:00.313 --> 24:02.274
I guess we'll have
to compare notes, Claire.

24:03.442 --> 24:04.776
Oh!

24:04.860 --> 24:06.695
I look forward to that.

24:06.778 --> 24:10.198
And to you getting me
a shit ton of money for my apartment.
