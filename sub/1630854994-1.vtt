02:17.833 --> 02:19.574
Please. Please.
Please, no.

02:28.757 --> 02:30.759
Please. Please.

02:42.336 --> 02:45.469
No. Please. Please.
Please. Please don't.

02:45.643 --> 02:48.603
Please.
No, no, please.

02:49.560 --> 02:51.171
Don't... don't do that!

02:58.917 --> 03:01.268
Please, John,
just let me talk to him. Okay?

03:01.442 --> 03:02.573
<i>Absolutely fucking not.</i>

03:02.747 --> 03:04.662
Come on.
It's been months.

03:04.836 --> 03:06.396
- You don't even care, do you?
- I care.

03:06.969 --> 03:08.275
I care.
What do you think I'm...

03:08.449 --> 03:10.102
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

03:10.277 --> 03:12.366
No, that's part of
what I'm talking about. Okay?

03:12.540 --> 03:15.107
The only person that
matters to Rachel is Rachel.

03:16.239 --> 03:18.285
Where is it? Hmm?

03:19.764 --> 03:21.288
Give it to me now.

03:21.462 --> 03:22.702
Oh, is this where we are going?

03:22.767 --> 03:24.813
Yeah.

03:27.772 --> 03:29.296
Okay. Slow it down there.

03:30.645 --> 03:31.907
You know what?

03:33.561 --> 03:36.433
You are such a fucking pussy.

03:36.607 --> 03:38.479
Baby, come on.
Why would I...

03:38.653 --> 03:40.892
You're a whore not a thief.
Give me the fucking ring now.

03:40.916 --> 03:42.613
- <i>No.</i>
- Yeah.

03:42.787 --> 03:44.833
Well, I am his mother, okay?
And he's my only baby.

03:45.007 --> 03:46.922
<i>You had your chance.
You fucked it up.</i>

03:47.096 --> 03:50.360
That is not fair. And that...
And you know that's not true.

03:52.101 --> 03:55.060
Nothing? I'm walking out
right now, you got nothing?

03:55.235 --> 03:57.846
Let me see this purse.
Give me this... ow!

03:58.020 --> 03:59.543
You wanna hit, huh?

03:59.717 --> 04:02.633
I paid you to leave,
not to steal my shit.

04:04.505 --> 04:05.810
I said slow it down.

04:06.985 --> 04:08.509
I'm not a fucking whore.

04:09.553 --> 04:11.294
Dude, what the fuck?
Come on.

04:11.468 --> 04:15.516
So you know what?
You pay for it for once.

04:17.866 --> 04:19.433
<i>You're a fucking psycho.</i>

04:19.607 --> 04:21.565
<i>- You're a fucking psycho.
- Stay out.</i>

04:21.739 --> 04:23.437
<i>Don't ever
fucking call me again.</i>

04:23.611 --> 04:25.569
<i>You're such a fucking psycho.</i>

04:25.743 --> 04:27.895
<i>And you know something, you're
not gonna bring her back,</i>

04:27.919 --> 04:30.095
<i>and it's your fucking fault
you drunk piece of shit.</i>

04:31.749 --> 04:33.185
<i>Keep walking.</i>

04:33.360 --> 04:34.186
<i>Come on.
I was just playing around.</i>

04:34.361 --> 04:35.579
<i>Fuck you.</i>

04:35.753 --> 04:36.753
<i>Jojo, good, copy.</i>

04:36.885 --> 04:38.626
<i>What the fuck, man?</i>

04:38.800 --> 04:40.715
<i>JoJo.
This is Stalker Two.</i>

04:40.889 --> 04:43.848
<i>Standing by for timeline.
All copy? Over.</i>

04:45.981 --> 04:47.504
<i>Stalker Two, solid copy.</i>

04:47.678 --> 04:50.681
<i>Stand by for Stalker One.</i>

04:50.855 --> 04:53.423
, <i>go.</i>
<i>Stay frosty, motherfuckers.</i>

04:53.597 --> 04:56.165
<i>Proceed with plan.</i>

04:56.339 --> 04:58.123
<i>Stalker Two, roger that.</i>

05:20.145 --> 05:22.191
General Santiago
is calling in, sir.

05:23.105 --> 05:24.236
Patch him in.

05:25.499 --> 05:27.631
General Santiago,
Colonel Roake reporting.

05:27.805 --> 05:28.893
<i>At ease Colonel.</i>

05:29.067 --> 05:30.591
<i>Status report?</i>

05:30.765 --> 05:33.158
Sir, I have five fresh
new assignments inbound

05:33.333 --> 05:35.073
and Chief Woodman is en route.

05:35.247 --> 05:36.684
<i>Copy. ETA?</i>

05:36.858 --> 05:38.599
Five mikes, sir.

05:38.773 --> 05:40.296
<i>Is that Israeli bitch there yet?</i>

05:41.253 --> 05:43.778
Thank you for the compliment.

05:43.952 --> 05:45.780
<i>- Wasn't a compliment.</i>
- No?

05:45.954 --> 05:48.391
Where I come from, if you're
referred to as a bitch

05:48.565 --> 05:50.350
means you're doing your job.

05:50.524 --> 05:51.960
<i>Then you should get a promotion.</i>

05:52.134 --> 05:53.831
<i>Just stay the fuck
out of the way.</i>

05:54.005 --> 05:56.051
<i>You've done your part.
Now let us do ours.</i>

05:56.225 --> 05:58.401
We'll do the right thing
at whatever cost.

06:00.142 --> 06:01.404
<i>Keep me posted, Colonel Roake.</i>

06:02.274 --> 06:04.102
Copy that, sir.

06:04.276 --> 06:06.116
<i>I hand-picked you
for this program. You get it?</i>

06:08.846 --> 06:10.457
<i>Don't drop the ball on me now.</i>

06:10.631 --> 06:13.111
<i>Too close to the finish line.</i>

06:13.285 --> 06:14.939
<i>I want a status report
in 48 hours</i>

06:15.113 --> 06:16.854
<i>and a clinical eval
on Woodman post hunt.</i>

06:17.377 --> 06:19.161
Understood.

06:19.335 --> 06:20.989
<i>This man in particular</i>

06:21.163 --> 06:24.209
<i>is of special interest to us,
Marcus Woodman.</i>

06:24.384 --> 06:26.342
<i>You do well for him,</i>

06:26.516 --> 06:28.170
<i>there may be
a brigadier general spot</i>

06:28.344 --> 06:29.984
<i>in our covert ops unit
here in Washington.</i>

06:30.302 --> 06:31.695
I know the stakes.

06:31.869 --> 06:34.089
<i>Good. Carry on.</i>

06:38.615 --> 06:39.660
Great day.

06:47.363 --> 06:49.409
Woodman's transport
is ten minutes out, sir.

06:49.583 --> 06:50.863
I want you to keep an eye on it.

07:07.252 --> 07:10.517
<i>You're gonna love it.
Trust me.</i>

07:11.953 --> 07:14.303
Okay. Now I know that you said
you don't wanna do anything,

07:14.477 --> 07:15.609
but...

07:17.045 --> 07:18.089
here you go.

07:22.050 --> 07:23.617
Stop.

07:23.791 --> 07:24.922
<i>Blue Jay 1, out copy, over.</i>

07:25.096 --> 07:26.184
Babe, you okay?

07:27.229 --> 07:29.231
- Babe.
- Get...

07:29.405 --> 07:30.687
- Babe, it's just a present.
- Just get away.

07:30.711 --> 07:32.452
- Babe.
- Jess, get away.

07:32.626 --> 07:34.584
- Get away. Get away. Get out.
- Babe? Marcus!

07:34.758 --> 07:36.499
Just get out.
Get out. Get out.

07:36.673 --> 07:38.022
<i>It's just a box, Marcus.</i>

07:38.196 --> 07:39.676
<i>Marcus, please, it's just a box.</i>

07:39.850 --> 07:41.330
<i>Get out!</i>

07:41.504 --> 07:42.636
<i>Please. Please, calm down.</i>

07:42.810 --> 07:44.289
<i>Please, make it stop.</i>

07:44.464 --> 07:47.379
<i>Please, it's just a box.</i>

07:47.554 --> 07:49.991
<i>Please, calm down. Please.</i>

07:50.165 --> 07:52.733
- Sir.
- Top, come in.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.300
- Thank you, sir.
- I called you here

07:55.475 --> 07:57.435
because I wanna talk to you
about our new recruit.

07:58.782 --> 07:59.914
We really need this one.

08:00.958 --> 08:02.438
Washington is telling us that

08:02.612 --> 08:04.658
if we pull this off
without a glitch...

08:06.181 --> 08:07.312
we get fully funded.

08:07.878 --> 08:09.227
Dream come true, sir.

08:10.054 --> 08:11.142
That it is.

08:17.584 --> 08:20.282
We pulled all the footage from
various devices in the home.

08:22.719 --> 08:24.939
Senior Chief Marcus Woodman.

08:26.593 --> 08:28.029
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

08:28.203 --> 08:29.944
Uh, it's my husband.

08:30.118 --> 08:32.118
He has locked himself
in the bathroom with his gun.

08:32.599 --> 08:33.861
Please help.

08:34.035 --> 08:35.471
Marcus.

08:36.341 --> 08:37.821
No, I don't know.

08:37.995 --> 08:39.780
I mean, he's talking
but not to me.

08:40.432 --> 08:43.566
Marcus, please.
Just come out baby. Please.

08:44.698 --> 08:47.831
I know you're in there.
Come back to me.

08:48.571 --> 08:51.922
I need you, Marcus.
I want you.

08:54.490 --> 08:57.624
Marcus. Marcus. Marcus.

09:01.149 --> 09:04.369
<i>Never scare me
like that again, please, babe.</i>

09:04.544 --> 09:06.894
Sir, it's hard to believe
all those stories.

09:08.330 --> 09:10.650
Yeah, well you better believe
them 'cause they're all true.

09:12.203 --> 09:14.243
Behavioral avoidance
can happen to the best of them.

09:16.033 --> 09:17.905
The man spent
the last four months

09:18.079 --> 09:19.907
at AMACORP's
Prime Psych Facility

09:20.081 --> 09:23.998
being probed and tested
and evaluated.

09:24.999 --> 09:26.870
Voodoo bullshit if you ask me.

09:27.567 --> 09:30.178
Now, it's up to us to
get him back in the saddle...

09:31.353 --> 09:32.528
for Ghost.

09:33.398 --> 09:34.791
Ghost Recon.

09:34.965 --> 09:36.097
Exactly.

09:37.272 --> 09:38.752
Never met anyone up for that.

09:40.362 --> 09:44.584
And Top,
you and I we pull this off,

09:44.758 --> 09:46.890
it's gonna be
a huge win for both of us.

09:48.152 --> 09:50.198
Sir, he's arrived.
Would you like him here?

09:50.807 --> 09:52.592
- That's fine.
- Sir.

10:10.392 --> 10:11.785
Damn! I'm good.

10:11.959 --> 10:15.049
I mean, it was okay.

10:15.527 --> 10:18.226
I mean, just five out of
five cans okay or was it...

10:18.400 --> 10:20.750
- Easy.
- I got it. It's okay.

10:20.924 --> 10:22.622
I know, I just...

10:22.796 --> 10:24.536
Uh...

10:26.103 --> 10:29.106
Anyway, do you wanna go set
the cans back up or?

10:29.846 --> 10:31.152
Yeah. For you.

10:31.631 --> 10:33.633
Oh, no, I'm not really
feeling it today.

10:36.070 --> 10:38.376
Look, if you don't
wanna talk about it,

10:38.550 --> 10:40.248
you don't have to, but you can.

10:46.994 --> 10:48.169
I don't know.

10:53.043 --> 10:54.436
I just, uh...

11:00.703 --> 11:03.140
it's like doing good
doesn't feel good anymore.

11:06.491 --> 11:08.624
Like the right thing
became the wrong thing...

11:10.104 --> 11:11.583
if that makes any sense.

11:14.325 --> 11:16.023
I mean,
if it makes sense to you,

11:16.197 --> 11:17.502
then that's all that matters.

11:17.677 --> 11:20.288
And maybe you could
go to that place

11:20.462 --> 11:23.073
and you could talk to somebody
and maybe they'll understand.

11:23.247 --> 11:25.162
Hmm.

11:26.076 --> 11:28.818
Either way.
I'm here for you.

11:31.865 --> 11:33.083
You got this.

11:50.448 --> 11:51.754
The wife?

11:52.494 --> 11:55.715
She passed away unfortunately
a while after he got out.

11:56.454 --> 11:58.282
I think it's why
he joined the program.

11:58.456 --> 11:59.806
Nothing left for him at home.

12:00.981 --> 12:02.460
That's tough stuff right there.

12:04.549 --> 12:05.637
Yeah, it is.

12:09.990 --> 12:11.295
Is he on board?

12:11.469 --> 12:12.819
He will be.

12:12.993 --> 12:14.908
Once he sees it's not about him,

12:15.082 --> 12:17.345
it's about the men and women
who will come after him.

12:17.519 --> 12:18.868
He is a soldier.

12:21.131 --> 12:22.524
He's not just any soldier.

12:24.178 --> 12:26.354
The man
is an exceptional Navy Seal.

12:26.528 --> 12:29.487
This is the fast track
back to where he belongs.

13:03.521 --> 13:06.481
- Hey, I'm okay.
- Are you sure?

13:06.655 --> 13:08.352
Yeah.

13:08.526 --> 13:10.417
You go deal with your friends.
They're here for you.

13:10.441 --> 13:11.747
I'm here for you.

13:12.922 --> 13:13.922
Thanks.

13:20.843 --> 13:22.003
Mind if I hang out over here?

13:22.149 --> 13:23.759
Mingling is not really my thing.

13:23.933 --> 13:25.543
Sure, I'm just
flipping these burgers

13:25.717 --> 13:26.956
pretending like I know
what I'm doing.

13:26.980 --> 13:28.808
Honestly, I like it.

13:29.373 --> 13:30.505
Greg.

13:31.332 --> 13:33.029
Marcus, nice to meet you.

13:33.203 --> 13:34.596
Like the poet king.

13:34.770 --> 13:36.728
- Or the assassin.
- Oh, yeah.

13:36.903 --> 13:38.383
Depends on
how you look at it I guess.

13:39.035 --> 13:40.167
That's true.

13:42.604 --> 13:43.910
Thanks for not saying that.

13:44.693 --> 13:45.693
Saying what?

13:45.825 --> 13:47.174
Uh, when people meet me,

13:47.348 --> 13:48.716
they usually can't wait
to get it out.

13:48.740 --> 13:50.090
Thank you for your service.

13:50.264 --> 13:52.092
Uh, yeah.
You guys don't like that.

13:52.266 --> 13:54.094
And I don't blame you.

13:54.268 --> 13:56.159
I think living a good life
is the best thanks I can give.

13:56.183 --> 13:57.227
Exactly.

13:58.663 --> 13:59.823
Jess said you're getting out?

14:01.231 --> 14:02.319
That's the plan.

14:32.001 --> 14:33.394
Took you long enough.

14:34.395 --> 14:35.526
What's that?

14:35.700 --> 14:37.006
To get here.

14:38.268 --> 14:39.574
Car trouble?

14:41.793 --> 14:43.186
I'll drive next time.

14:44.274 --> 14:45.274
Shit.

14:45.406 --> 14:47.016
Heard about your wife.

14:49.671 --> 14:51.107
She's why I'm here.

14:51.281 --> 14:52.717
I never picked
one up along the way.

14:53.501 --> 14:54.850
It's too much to carry.

14:55.633 --> 14:57.374
- We ready to go?
- You know that mission.

14:59.681 --> 15:00.856
Is it true?

15:01.030 --> 15:02.423
What's it to you, man?

15:02.597 --> 15:06.557
It's just,
you know, over 200 kills.

15:07.210 --> 15:09.125
You go on a Rambo and shit.

15:09.299 --> 15:12.563
And then, of course, you had
to put down your own objective.

15:13.782 --> 15:16.785
It's too wounded
to move so they say.

15:20.006 --> 15:21.833
So they say.

15:22.008 --> 15:24.208
You know, that's the thing
about Lone Survivor missions.

15:24.532 --> 15:28.188
It's only ever one version
of the story, yours.

15:28.362 --> 15:29.841
Ops aren't always clean.

15:30.016 --> 15:31.616
Oh, I'm not afraid
to get my hands dirty.

15:32.540 --> 15:33.889
I can see that.

15:37.632 --> 15:40.200
You know, the most
dangerous animal in the world,

15:40.374 --> 15:41.592
it's a desperate one.

15:42.724 --> 15:46.554
Had a mission like
yours once, Siberia,

15:46.728 --> 15:48.121
three days in the mountains.

15:49.035 --> 15:51.689
Snowstorm.
Signal was shit.

15:51.863 --> 15:54.562
Intel was wrong, like usual.

15:55.389 --> 15:59.219
We were hurt,
bleeding bad, no ammo.

15:59.393 --> 16:01.569
The forest was too thick
to land anything in.

16:01.743 --> 16:03.353
So we had to climb to elevation.

16:04.311 --> 16:06.835
Snow you've never seen
in your fucking life.

16:08.924 --> 16:10.665
About 15 hours in
we start getting tracked

16:10.839 --> 16:11.971
by a pack of wolves.

16:13.973 --> 16:15.191
Wolves.

16:15.713 --> 16:17.541
It doesn't happen
like you think.

16:18.194 --> 16:19.979
They don't come fast, they wait.

16:21.154 --> 16:23.634
They stalk you.
They scout ahead.

16:25.419 --> 16:27.508
They find the perfect
ground to attack.

16:27.682 --> 16:28.988
Just like us.

16:30.728 --> 16:33.644
My team and I, we took
a stand and we waited.

16:34.384 --> 16:36.125
Those wolves knew
what it was too.

16:37.474 --> 16:39.781
'Cause here comes the biggest
motherfucker they got.

16:40.521 --> 16:44.612
Gray, this black chest...

16:44.786 --> 16:47.006
these big yellow eyes.

16:48.703 --> 16:50.444
I knew when
I saw that motherfucker

16:50.618 --> 16:53.751
a sacrifice would have
to be made one way or another.

16:55.492 --> 16:56.885
I let him get close.

16:58.191 --> 16:59.801
And when he launched
I stuck my hand

16:59.975 --> 17:03.109
in that motherfuckers mouth
and I pulled him close.

17:04.240 --> 17:06.242
I was the last thing
he ever saw.

17:08.375 --> 17:11.682
So I'm still breathing
and he's not.

17:12.683 --> 17:14.294
- Lucky for you.
- You know,

17:14.468 --> 17:15.904
they talk like
you're some big hero.

17:16.905 --> 17:20.648
Well, my team is still alive,
your guy isn't.

17:23.172 --> 17:24.913
<i>Claver, ready for Woodman.</i>

17:27.220 --> 17:28.830
Time to let
the dog off the leash.

17:33.400 --> 17:34.444
You're wrong.

17:35.228 --> 17:36.490
How's that?

17:37.273 --> 17:40.755
The most dangerous animal,
it isn't the desperate one.

17:42.017 --> 17:44.367
It's one with nothing to lose.

17:48.545 --> 17:50.069
Ready?
One, two.

18:28.107 --> 18:29.412
I'll get him back to you

18:29.586 --> 18:30.848
after I debrief him.

18:31.501 --> 18:33.024
Top, take care of him.
Will you?

18:34.417 --> 18:35.462
Copy that sir.

18:36.724 --> 18:37.986
Thank you.

18:38.943 --> 18:40.031
Chief.

18:43.513 --> 18:44.601
I'm Colonel Roake.

18:45.776 --> 18:46.908
Good to meet you, son.

18:48.649 --> 18:49.693
Come on in.

19:00.313 --> 19:01.705
<i>Welcome to the new</i>

19:01.879 --> 19:03.533
<i>AMACORP Hunting Program.</i>

19:03.707 --> 19:06.841
<i>The ultimate hunting

<i>Your mission,

19:10.149 --> 19:11.498
<i>and execute them.</i>

19:38.612 --> 19:39.830
How you doing, son?

19:40.004 --> 19:41.354
Fine.
Just ready to go.

19:42.616 --> 19:44.357
- You packed and strapped?
- Of course.

19:44.531 --> 19:46.291
Checked it twice
like I have been trained to.

19:46.968 --> 19:48.274
- Stay alert.
- Stay alive.

19:52.365 --> 19:53.583
You know, nerves are good.

19:54.236 --> 19:56.325
- Keeps you sharp.
- I'm not nervous.

19:57.065 --> 19:58.849
Hey, Top,
you mind if I have a word?

20:01.939 --> 20:03.071
Yeah.

20:09.556 --> 20:10.818
So, Marcus Woodman?

20:12.559 --> 20:13.821
Yeah.

20:16.040 --> 20:17.390
To be honest.

20:17.564 --> 20:18.671
I've heard some
wild ass shit about him.

20:18.695 --> 20:20.567
Hmm.
I hear ya.

20:20.741 --> 20:23.309
But we're the only ones who
can relate to this man, right?

20:24.832 --> 20:27.269
Like him or not,
he's one of ours.

20:27.443 --> 20:28.531
He's not one of mine.

20:30.229 --> 20:32.389
You kill one of our own,
there's no excuse. Not for me.

20:35.016 --> 20:36.191
Yeah.

20:36.757 --> 20:37.932
Hey.

20:40.848 --> 20:42.458
- Hey.
- Hello.

20:42.632 --> 20:44.721
- Hey.
- Hello.

20:45.983 --> 20:47.507
Help.

20:47.681 --> 20:52.207
Oh, God. Help.
Help me. Help me, please.

20:52.381 --> 20:54.209
Please.
Please, get me out of here.

20:56.298 --> 20:58.431
Please. Please. Please.

20:59.170 --> 21:00.433
Why does my head hurt?

21:00.607 --> 21:01.967
Please help me out of here.
Please.

21:02.435 --> 21:03.827
I don't fucking know.

21:04.001 --> 21:05.307
I didn't do anything, please.

21:05.481 --> 21:06.721
Just calm down. Just calm down.

21:06.874 --> 21:08.049
Shut up, bitch!

21:08.223 --> 21:09.746
Please, somebody help.

21:09.920 --> 21:11.835
Help!
Hey! Somebody!

21:12.880 --> 21:14.142
Let me out!

21:15.230 --> 21:16.971
It was just me and my boyfriend

21:17.145 --> 21:18.755
and we were having dinner
and then, uh...

21:19.408 --> 21:22.585
Yeah, let... let's start to...
I... I was out at the bar.

21:22.759 --> 21:24.544
Yo, I don't remember shit.

21:24.718 --> 21:27.895
I... I had just...
I was coming home from work.

21:28.069 --> 21:29.244
Let me out!

21:29.418 --> 21:31.072
Let me out! Let me out!

21:31.246 --> 21:32.789
- Keep it down, man.
- We're being watched.

21:32.813 --> 21:34.075
What?

21:34.249 --> 21:35.816
Look, we're being watched.

21:35.990 --> 21:38.427
We're being watched.
Look there. Look. Look.

21:38.601 --> 21:41.561
Somebody,
anybody, let me out now.

21:41.735 --> 21:45.042
Help us!
Hello! Help!

21:55.575 --> 21:56.880
What number hunt
is this for you?

21:58.491 --> 22:00.144
I don't know.
A few dozen.

22:01.102 --> 22:04.366
And, um, how has your home life
been since treatment?

22:05.802 --> 22:07.064
Excellent, honestly.

22:08.065 --> 22:09.284
Professionally?

22:11.373 --> 22:12.548
Better than ever.

22:14.594 --> 22:17.118
So don't you think
it would be fair

22:17.292 --> 22:19.599
if we give this man
the same chances we gave you?

22:28.651 --> 22:30.174
Yeah, you're right.

22:32.220 --> 22:33.830
I just had to say something.

22:34.614 --> 22:36.790
Woodman will mainly be
with me and Junior today

22:36.964 --> 22:38.357
I'll keep an eye on him.

22:40.489 --> 22:42.404
How's the little
dumb dumb doing?

22:45.364 --> 22:46.800
He's wound a little
tight right now,

22:46.974 --> 22:48.192
but that's how it goes.

22:49.237 --> 22:51.848
His results will come
once he's been in the hot seat.

22:52.501 --> 22:54.373
Then we'll see if this
is preventative as well.

23:05.166 --> 23:06.167
The fuck are you?

23:09.649 --> 23:11.215
What the fuck?
Get off me.

23:11.390 --> 23:13.348
Hey, hey.
Fuck you man.

23:13.522 --> 23:16.743
Seriously?
Answer me. Hey, hey.

23:20.094 --> 23:21.400
Don't fucking care.

23:25.969 --> 23:27.275
Help me.

23:45.336 --> 23:46.776
Can you just
tell me what's going on?

23:46.903 --> 23:48.688
What's going on?

23:48.862 --> 23:50.385
Person to person, please.

23:54.650 --> 23:55.912
They are ready.

No, no, no. You have...
You have the wrong people.

24:48.443 --> 24:51.054
Okay. I haven't done
anything wrong. Please.

<i>You see, there are no accidents.</i>

What?

25:58.165 --> 25:59.949
<i>Should you choose

26:00.123 --> 26:02.125
<i>Well, I can end your life.
It's nothing to me.</i>

26:03.126 --> 26:04.780

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait, wait, wait.

26:22.581 --> 26:24.381
What? Ultimate sacrifice.
What does that mean?

<i>Zimieski, please escort them</i>

<i>Oh, and good luck.</i>

26:38.684 --> 26:41.382
Don't fucking think about it.

26:58.268 --> 26:59.530
Anybody else?

27:11.064 --> 27:12.282
Get up.

27:15.764 --> 27:17.070
Get up against the wall.

27:18.245 --> 27:19.289
Hey, shit head.

27:20.551 --> 27:23.729
Scoot over, Jesus.
You wanna see something?

27:23.903 --> 27:25.818
- What is it?
- My hunt?

27:25.992 --> 27:27.428
No, not really.

27:27.602 --> 27:28.951
Why not?

27:29.125 --> 27:30.823
You know what?
Guess I'm kinda over

27:30.997 --> 27:32.825
watching other people
get the experience.

27:34.522 --> 27:37.568
I hear you.
And trust me, I get it.

27:37.743 --> 27:40.354
I wish that I would've
started off the way you are.

27:40.528 --> 27:43.009
Participation first, kill later.

27:43.487 --> 27:45.185
Death is a motherfucker.

27:45.402 --> 27:46.902
Without the right people,
it'll really fuck you up.

27:46.926 --> 27:48.188
Yeah, I get it.

27:48.362 --> 27:49.600
I'm kind of tired
of the excuses.

27:49.624 --> 27:50.930
Some people wanna kill.

27:51.104 --> 27:52.583
Okay.
And what if they don't?

27:53.367 --> 27:55.064
Really?

27:55.238 --> 27:56.781
No one's ever thought
they'd be good at killing

27:56.805 --> 27:58.217
and actually been right
about themselves?

27:58.241 --> 28:00.461
Jesus H... well,
I mean, here's the deal,

28:00.635 --> 28:02.463
Princess,
you're in a bit of a mood.

28:02.637 --> 28:05.422
So I'm gonna help less and
I'm gonna kick it over here.

28:05.596 --> 28:07.076
But just don't forget

28:07.250 --> 28:08.817
I can whoop
your fucking ass, all right?

28:08.991 --> 28:10.993
Sure, sure, sure.
Just know I can handle it.

28:11.907 --> 28:13.169
Handle what, boy?

28:13.343 --> 28:15.955
Kill, Dad.
I'm fucking ready, man.

28:16.129 --> 28:17.541
You have me
sitting here in the wings.

28:17.565 --> 28:19.219
I mean, how are
we supposed to know

28:19.393 --> 28:21.284
if it's preventative treatment
if we don't test it out?

28:21.308 --> 28:22.938
I know corporate's on your ass
but I'm fucking sick...

28:22.962 --> 28:24.202
I don't care what AMACORP says.

28:24.354 --> 28:25.834
You'll go
when I say you're ready.

28:34.538 --> 28:36.366
Don't worry about Woodman.

28:37.759 --> 28:40.980
You will go soon.

28:42.721 --> 28:44.244
<i>You have made it</i>

28:44.418 --> 28:46.159
<i>to the final stage
of your treatment.</i>

28:46.333 --> 28:48.988
<i>Now go enjoy yourself
and have a happy hunt.</i>

28:49.597 --> 28:51.164
That's exactly what we do here.

28:51.904 --> 28:52.948
Now, you know.

28:53.906 --> 28:56.299
No more rumors
or whisperings in your command.

28:56.473 --> 28:58.606
This is it.
Soft combat.

28:59.346 --> 29:00.666
It's why there's
so much hardware.

29:01.565 --> 29:04.830
Your support staff
is beyond excellent.

29:08.311 --> 29:11.184
While somewhat controversial,
these methods have been, well,

29:11.358 --> 29:13.577
beyond expectation
in terms of results.

29:15.492 --> 29:17.494
We get our soldiers
back to work,

29:17.668 --> 29:21.498
whether it's
for the country or for us.

29:26.590 --> 29:29.332
That's all well and good but
the real question here is...

29:30.812 --> 29:32.268
are you willing
to do the work necessary

29:32.292 --> 29:33.772
to get back out
where you belong?

29:36.078 --> 29:38.559
Because son,
your... your dossier is...

29:38.733 --> 29:39.952
Excellent.

29:42.215 --> 29:43.346
That it is.

29:45.740 --> 29:48.221
But it's not just about you,

29:48.395 --> 29:50.789
it's about a lot of other
men and women like you.

29:52.051 --> 29:54.662
The data
we retrieve in the field,

29:54.836 --> 29:56.969
it dramatically improves
our entire process.

29:59.362 --> 30:02.148
So if you ever
wanna make a difference,

30:02.322 --> 30:03.845
here's your chance.

30:04.933 --> 30:07.283
- Does it work?
- Yes, it does.

30:08.545 --> 30:10.069
This is something
to be proud of, son.

30:15.814 --> 30:17.946
Talked and thought enough
the last few months.

30:20.470 --> 30:21.515
Let's get on with it.

30:25.127 --> 30:28.217
You heard the man,
let's get on with it.

30:46.366 --> 30:48.063
Protocol is as follows.

30:48.237 --> 30:50.239
You'll have exactly 60 minutes

30:50.413 --> 30:52.413
to get a head start
before your team gets their OP.

30:52.894 --> 30:55.288
- Fuck this shit, man.
- Fucking serious?

30:56.593 --> 30:57.638
Let's do this.

30:57.812 --> 30:59.770
- Okay.
- Okay.

31:04.079 --> 31:05.951
How do we survive
something like this?

31:08.127 --> 31:09.167
Just make it to the river.

31:10.259 --> 31:11.410
I'll get you, you piece of shit.

31:11.434 --> 31:13.088
- Stop.
- I swear.

31:13.262 --> 31:15.110
- Stop. Stop. Stop.
- You don't even fucking know.

31:15.134 --> 31:16.894
- I'll come for you, you fuck.
- Please stop.

31:28.364 --> 31:31.541
Please. You...
You don't have to do this.

31:31.715 --> 31:33.326
You can just...
You just let us go.

31:34.327 --> 31:35.458
You better hurry.

31:47.601 --> 31:48.689
Kill the music.

31:50.430 --> 31:51.561
No need.

31:51.735 --> 31:53.912
Up, rest.

31:54.477 --> 31:56.557
Chief, you can settle
in here with your support team.

31:57.045 --> 32:00.309
Gentlemen, ladies,

32:00.483 --> 32:01.702
you all know the drill.

32:02.529 --> 32:05.184
This man is in the final phases
of his treatment,

32:05.358 --> 32:07.882
which means he needs our help.

32:08.883 --> 32:12.626
So, we're gonna do
everything within our power

32:12.800 --> 32:14.802
to make sure we get him
back in the saddle.

32:15.716 --> 32:17.022
Is that clear with all of you?

32:17.196 --> 32:18.719
Yes, sir.

32:18.893 --> 32:20.373
I expect it to be done.

32:21.940 --> 32:23.637
- Good luck.
- Sir.

32:26.422 --> 32:27.510
Welcome.

32:30.252 --> 32:31.471
Make yourself at home.

32:32.733 --> 32:34.039
We're still a little ways out

32:34.213 --> 32:35.493
so you help yourself
to anything.

32:36.389 --> 32:37.433
Thank you.

32:39.044 --> 32:41.785
Welcome, brother.
Good to have you.

32:42.699 --> 32:44.223
You boys kissing?

32:44.397 --> 32:46.094
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

32:46.268 --> 32:49.141
I would actually.
Um, don't listen to Price.

32:49.315 --> 32:51.230
He will never stop
talking to you.

32:51.404 --> 32:53.493
Oh, I thought
you got off my wit, my charm?

32:53.667 --> 32:56.104
Mm. I thought you'd know by now
when a woman was faking it.

32:56.278 --> 32:57.714
Damn.
That's cold.

32:59.151 --> 33:01.501
You know I love you Price,

33:01.675 --> 33:03.285
like a brother.

33:03.459 --> 33:05.896
Like a much younger,
slower brother

33:06.071 --> 33:07.768
who needs my help
just to tie his shoes.

33:07.942 --> 33:09.944
Okay.
Let the man settle in.

33:14.688 --> 33:16.690
Chief Woodman,
you can bunk up over there.

33:41.932 --> 33:43.195
Where are we headed?

33:43.369 --> 33:44.544
Straight to the river.

33:45.197 --> 33:46.807
How much time do we even have?

33:46.981 --> 33:48.504
Wait, wait.
He gave me a watch.

33:48.678 --> 33:50.028
Okay, we'll stop and check.

33:51.855 --> 33:52.855
What time you got?

33:52.987 --> 33:54.510
49 minutes left.

33:54.684 --> 33:56.077
No, we need to pick it up.

33:56.251 --> 33:58.123
No, we need to be smart.

33:58.297 --> 34:01.213
She's gonna kill us.
All right? She's moving slow.

34:01.387 --> 34:02.866
She should give me the watch.

34:03.041 --> 34:04.694
I have the best chance
to get out there.

34:04.868 --> 34:06.759
No, we have the best chance
if we stick together.

34:06.783 --> 34:08.674
Yeah. For the last time
I'm not giving you this watch.

34:08.698 --> 34:10.744
You think what you want.
I'm making it to the river.

34:10.918 --> 34:12.638
Look, if you don't have
anything good to say

34:12.702 --> 34:14.487
then just shut up.

34:14.661 --> 34:15.705
What's that?

34:17.359 --> 34:18.839
What?

34:20.406 --> 34:21.885
That.

34:22.625 --> 34:23.800
Oh, my...

34:24.671 --> 34:25.672
Careful.

34:26.629 --> 34:28.283
Where are its arms and legs?

34:28.457 --> 34:29.893
What are you doing?

34:30.068 --> 34:31.286
Being of use.

34:35.595 --> 34:36.944
I think we should keep moving.

34:37.118 --> 34:38.511
Yeah.
What the fuck?

34:42.689 --> 34:44.125
Did you find anything?

34:44.734 --> 34:47.085
No.

34:47.259 --> 34:50.000
No, we should, uh, do like
she says and keep moving.

34:53.352 --> 34:54.744
Come on.

35:06.278 --> 35:07.496
Excuse me.

35:09.498 --> 35:11.021
Woodman's looking a little weak.

35:11.196 --> 35:12.762
Especially socially.

35:12.936 --> 35:14.764
You wanna explain that to me

35:14.938 --> 35:17.376
considering he spent so much
time at your research facility?

35:17.550 --> 35:19.073
He did.

35:19.247 --> 35:21.127
But we are talking about
a man who is considered

35:21.162 --> 35:22.487
to have been one
of our deadliest Seals

35:22.511 --> 35:24.034
in the last five years.

35:24.209 --> 35:26.211
So you okay sending him
out there with my men?

35:26.385 --> 35:29.518
Of course.
Colonel, let's be clear.

35:29.692 --> 35:31.781
Nothing we do
will ever fully get these men

35:31.955 --> 35:33.566
and women back
to where they once were.

35:33.740 --> 35:36.046
But we can see to it
that they're useful again.

35:36.221 --> 35:39.354
Useful people is
what makes society tick.

35:41.965 --> 35:43.271
Thanks for the education.

35:46.231 --> 35:47.928
If Woodman
doesn't shoot, you do.

35:48.102 --> 35:49.495
Yes, ma'am.

35:50.322 --> 35:53.368
43 minutes left.
Can we stop for a second?

35:53.542 --> 35:55.022
No.

35:55.196 --> 35:56.695
It's okay.
You just gotta stay positive.

35:56.719 --> 35:58.330
- Thanks.
- You know.

36:03.509 --> 36:04.901
Hey, hey!

36:05.075 --> 36:06.642
Guys, come quick.

36:06.816 --> 36:08.557
What the fuck?
Give it a minute, man.

36:09.515 --> 36:11.821
I thought
we cleaned up all the traps.

36:11.995 --> 36:13.388
We must have missed one, sir.

36:14.389 --> 36:16.043
It's a waste is what it is.

36:16.217 --> 36:17.784
Waste of a good resource.

36:17.958 --> 36:19.438
It won't happen again, sir.

36:21.048 --> 36:22.223
It better not.

36:28.534 --> 36:29.535
Be careful guys.

36:31.624 --> 36:32.755
Oh, my God.

36:32.929 --> 36:34.453
What the hell is that?

36:34.627 --> 36:37.151
Out here, a wolf trap
or something like that?

36:37.325 --> 36:38.587
How bad is it?

36:38.761 --> 36:40.041
How do you know
it's a wolf trap?

36:40.198 --> 36:41.677
Slowly.

36:41.851 --> 36:43.481
What? You've never seen
a wolf trap before?

36:43.505 --> 36:44.917
We don't have time
for this, we gotta go.

36:44.941 --> 36:47.988
Fuck you, Lance.
No seriously. Fuck you.

36:48.597 --> 36:50.991
- How do I get this thing off?
- Usually, that is uncinched.

36:51.165 --> 36:54.037
Let me try.

36:55.952 --> 36:57.780
- Please. It hurts.
- God, it's not moving.

36:58.607 --> 37:00.130
Stop whining.

37:00.305 --> 37:02.611
Either I'm not
strong enough or it's stuck.

37:04.222 --> 37:07.486
Fine. Fine. I'll fucking help
if it gets her out quicker.

37:07.660 --> 37:08.922
Hey.
You got it.

37:09.096 --> 37:10.619
All right, you ready?

37:13.143 --> 37:14.928
One, two, three.

37:15.102 --> 37:16.103
Pull.

37:16.277 --> 37:17.800
It's not moving.

37:17.974 --> 37:19.280
Pull harder motherfucker.

37:21.326 --> 37:23.023
It's not.

37:23.197 --> 37:24.546
Fuck!

37:25.721 --> 37:27.241
Uh, maybe we can
cut it with something.

37:27.375 --> 37:28.681
- Yeah.
- With what?

37:28.855 --> 37:30.248
Uh, let's see. Uh.

37:31.161 --> 37:32.617
The chain goes
all the way around the log

37:32.641 --> 37:34.121
there's no way
we're gonna move it.

37:34.295 --> 37:36.297
Or we could break it
with something somehow.

37:36.471 --> 37:38.952
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Uh, a rock or anything sharp.

37:39.126 --> 37:40.736
- Oh, my God.
- Here, here, here.

37:41.302 --> 37:43.565
Oh, okay, okay, here.

37:47.439 --> 37:48.918
The shit's not working.

37:50.050 --> 37:51.530
Time?

37:51.704 --> 37:52.984
I don't know, she has the watch.

37:58.363 --> 38:01.148
Can we have it?
Just in case?

38:01.322 --> 38:03.106
Wait.

38:15.249 --> 38:16.598
Okay.

38:21.995 --> 38:23.301
Thirty-eight minutes.

38:23.475 --> 38:25.085
Which just means
we gotta be faster.

38:25.259 --> 38:27.179
No, it means we're
literally running out of time.

38:27.261 --> 38:29.045
We can't sit here
and play MacGyver forever.

38:29.219 --> 38:31.352
Seriously,
what is wrong with you?

38:31.526 --> 38:32.745
Look, we've got about an hour.

38:32.919 --> 38:34.442
We can still do this.

38:34.616 --> 38:36.202
I would want you to do
the same if it were me.

38:36.226 --> 38:38.054
I'm just being realistic.

38:38.228 --> 38:40.468
Oh, really? So you'd want us to
just leave you here for dead?

38:40.492 --> 38:41.971
Abso-fucking-lutely.

38:42.145 --> 38:43.799
You are a real
piece of work, man.

38:43.973 --> 38:45.853
I'm not dying for
some stranger. I... I'm sorry.

38:45.932 --> 38:47.847
Oh, but you can kill
one with your car?

38:48.674 --> 38:50.676
Fucking know
what you're talking about.

38:50.850 --> 38:52.634
Stop!

38:52.808 --> 38:54.593
- You don't fucking know.
- Stop.

38:54.767 --> 38:56.334
It's not helping
at all. Okay?

38:56.508 --> 38:58.684
Hey, hey, hey.
What's that?

39:05.821 --> 39:08.650
Look, put pressure right here.

39:08.824 --> 39:10.304
Quit the shit.

39:12.611 --> 39:13.916
A hunting vehicle.

39:14.090 --> 39:15.222
This shit is not gonna run.

39:15.396 --> 39:16.789
- Glove box.
- Right?

39:16.963 --> 39:18.323
Maybe there's something
we can use.

39:36.809 --> 39:38.288
Woodman takes out the band,

39:38.463 --> 39:40.726
it's with our support
and support only.

39:44.120 --> 39:46.732
Stay loose and have some fun.

39:48.211 --> 39:49.343
All right?

39:51.127 --> 39:52.651
Let's have a go.

40:16.326 --> 40:20.940
Fuck. Fuck.
Where's the fucking gun?

40:24.987 --> 40:26.859
I found something.

40:29.470 --> 40:30.689
- Jesus.
- Fuck!

40:30.863 --> 40:32.081
Sorry.

40:38.523 --> 40:40.046
This is stupid, but...

40:40.220 --> 40:41.264
What?

40:42.657 --> 40:44.398
I didn't do anything
that I wanted to do.

40:45.704 --> 40:46.792
What do you mean?

40:49.882 --> 40:51.274
I just...

40:52.754 --> 40:55.496
I was just too stupid.

40:55.670 --> 40:57.367
I don't know, I was selfish.

40:57.542 --> 40:58.867
- Please don't talk like that.
- I'm gonna die here...

40:58.891 --> 41:00.240
Don't talk like that.

41:00.414 --> 41:02.024
I'm so sorry.
I did it all wrong.

41:02.198 --> 41:03.558
Don't be sorry.
Okay. Don't. Don't.

41:03.722 --> 41:05.162
- I did it all wrong.
- I promise you

41:05.288 --> 41:06.614
that we are gonna
get you out of here.

41:06.638 --> 41:07.943
It's okay.

41:09.945 --> 41:10.990
I'm sorry.

41:11.599 --> 41:14.602
Please, no.
Stay awake.

41:15.342 --> 41:17.779
Stay awake.
Rachel, just breathe.

41:17.953 --> 41:19.793
Okay. Just breathe.
We're gonna get outta here.

41:19.868 --> 41:20.956
We're gonna get outta here.

41:21.957 --> 41:25.874
Yeah. Hey, this looks like
the area we're in right now.

41:26.527 --> 41:27.963
- Right?
- Wait. Hold... hold on.

41:28.137 --> 41:29.697
We don't even know
if that shit is real.

41:29.965 --> 41:31.045
What are you talking about?

41:31.097 --> 41:32.794
Well, the map.

41:32.968 --> 41:34.380
I mean, it's a perfect
fucking map placed here for us.

41:34.404 --> 41:36.058
- We don't know.
- Come on.

41:36.232 --> 41:37.906
You can't be serious.
I mean, look at this thing.

41:37.930 --> 41:39.211
Looks like hasn't been
touched in forever.

41:39.235 --> 41:40.933
They probably forgot about it.

41:41.107 --> 41:42.824
And who gives a fuck?
It's the only thing we got.

41:42.848 --> 41:44.850
Feels like you're
working against us, it's crazy.

41:45.024 --> 41:47.156
Who me? You fuck face!
I'm trying to be smart.

41:47.330 --> 41:48.941
Who knows what
they set up for us?

41:49.115 --> 41:50.769
Holy shit.
Hey, hey. Guys.

41:50.943 --> 41:52.858
Holy shit.
This could be the river.

41:53.032 --> 41:55.469
And this looks like a clearing
not too far from here, right?

41:55.643 --> 41:56.818
Between us and the river.

41:56.992 --> 41:58.559
Yeah. Yeah.
I... I say...

41:58.733 --> 42:00.232
I say we go there
and try and find something

42:00.256 --> 42:01.582
to help us
get the hell outta here.

42:01.606 --> 42:02.998
Guys, she passed out.

42:03.172 --> 42:04.826
Shit.

42:06.001 --> 42:07.263
It's not good, guys.

42:12.486 --> 42:14.227
What... what is that?

42:16.142 --> 42:17.622
Kyle, what...
What time do you have?

42:19.188 --> 42:21.190
30 minutes. It might be
a warning or something.

42:21.364 --> 42:22.820
Yeah, unless
that lead was bullshitting

42:22.844 --> 42:24.280
and they're coming right now.

42:24.454 --> 42:25.649
Either way,
we probably shouldn't stay

42:25.673 --> 42:26.674
in one spot too long.

42:26.848 --> 42:28.110
What about helping Rachel?

42:43.822 --> 42:45.214
Eagle one, this is Red Dog one.

42:45.388 --> 42:46.694
Do you copy?

42:46.868 --> 42:48.043
<i>Red Dog, this is Eagle.</i>

42:48.217 --> 42:50.132
<i>We got you loud.</i>

42:50.306 --> 42:52.346
<i>Be advised that designated
call signs are in effect.</i>

42:52.395 --> 42:53.701
Copy Eagle one.

42:53.875 --> 42:55.921
Red Dog, two, three, four, five,

42:56.095 --> 42:57.618
this is Red Dog one, mic check.

42:58.880 --> 43:00.099
Three here.

43:00.273 --> 43:01.535
Four here.

43:01.709 --> 43:03.319
- Five here.
- Copy that.

43:03.493 --> 43:05.931
Eagle one, Red Dog one, two
and five will branch off

43:06.105 --> 43:09.064
to the southwest and head
down to the clearing, break.

43:09.238 --> 43:12.372
<i>Red Dog three and four will
team up and head southbound</i>

43:12.546 --> 43:14.026
<i>to flank them
as we flush them out.</i>

43:14.200 --> 43:16.898
<i>Red Dog one out.</i>

43:17.072 --> 43:18.378
<i>Great. Copy.</i>

43:26.691 --> 43:29.607
We already did this. All right?
We obviously have to leave her.

43:29.781 --> 43:31.130
We can't.

43:31.304 --> 43:32.958
If it weren't
for that map and watch,

43:33.132 --> 43:34.612
I wouldn't be standing here.

43:34.786 --> 43:36.614
Her leg is fucked
even if she wakes up.

43:36.788 --> 43:38.180
No, no, no, no.
Okay. Just wait.

43:38.354 --> 43:40.313
- For what?
- I can get her up.

43:40.487 --> 43:44.143
Okay? Come on, Rachel.
Wake up.

43:44.317 --> 43:45.927
Guys, I hate to say
but we have to go.

43:46.101 --> 43:47.320
- No.
- Now!

43:47.494 --> 43:48.843
Time?

43:49.539 --> 43:50.889
23 minutes.

43:51.846 --> 43:55.850
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
You wanna live, right?

43:56.024 --> 43:57.591
- Right?
- Yes.

43:57.765 --> 43:59.288
This is something we have to do.

43:59.462 --> 44:00.812
There is no choice here.

44:06.426 --> 44:08.515
- Okay, fine.
- Thank you. Thank you.

44:30.450 --> 44:31.712
Oh, my God.
The map is real.

44:32.670 --> 44:34.367
You know, I don't see anybody.

44:35.934 --> 44:37.239
I can go down there.

44:37.762 --> 44:39.304
Yeah, why don't...
Why don't you give me the map?

44:39.328 --> 44:40.808
I'll check out over here.

44:40.982 --> 44:42.307
No, fuck that.
We'll never see you again.

44:42.331 --> 44:44.116
Are you sure?

44:44.290 --> 44:46.771
Yeah. I can go down there
and I'll... I'll scope it out

44:46.945 --> 44:48.076
and I'll wave you guys down.

44:49.077 --> 44:50.339
All right, you better hurry

44:50.513 --> 44:51.873
'cause we only got
13 minutes left.

45:19.325 --> 45:20.369
What's your deal?

45:21.196 --> 45:23.416
You're not
your usual jackass self today.

45:24.373 --> 45:26.071
- What do you mean?
- You know what I mean.

45:26.245 --> 45:27.855
I heard you talking to Rawlings.

45:29.248 --> 45:31.076
You know that mission
at the ISO prison

45:31.250 --> 45:32.512
with the CIA dude?

45:33.165 --> 45:35.297
The one where one of ours
killed over 200 of theirs?

45:35.907 --> 45:37.430
Yeah, of course.

45:38.300 --> 45:39.388
Well.

45:43.044 --> 45:44.089
Woodman?

45:46.526 --> 45:47.788
- Oh.
- Yeah.

45:50.748 --> 45:52.706
Okay.

45:52.880 --> 45:54.249
All right,
I say we look for anything

45:54.273 --> 45:55.753
we can use to defend ourselves.

45:55.927 --> 45:57.537
I bet we could find
something that would

45:57.711 --> 45:59.341
- cut that chain on Rachel.
- No, she's dead, Sara!

45:59.365 --> 46:01.280
She's dead!
And we are too if we go back.

46:02.803 --> 46:05.240
Yeah.
We... weapons. Yeah. Okay.

46:05.414 --> 46:07.677
Uh, uh, I'll check
that big stuff over there.

46:07.852 --> 46:09.114
Okay. Yeah. Okay.

46:09.288 --> 46:10.568
Let's split up.
I'll go with you.

46:11.333 --> 46:12.813
Fine. We'll look over here.

46:20.995 --> 46:22.214
Check around the corner.

46:22.780 --> 46:23.974
That's one
of the most savage things

46:23.998 --> 46:24.999
I've ever heard of.

46:25.957 --> 46:27.523
I know.

46:29.047 --> 46:31.167
So, you afraid that there's
gonna be a bigger swinging

46:31.266 --> 46:32.441
dick around here?

46:32.615 --> 46:34.139
- Ha-ha.
- Mm-hmm.

46:34.313 --> 46:36.271
My dick is just
perfectly average, so fuck you.

46:36.445 --> 46:37.707
I'm just saying.

46:38.099 --> 46:39.535
Well, I'm saying there's some

46:39.753 --> 46:41.600
pretty fucked up details
said about that mission.

46:41.624 --> 46:43.191
- So?
- So?

46:43.975 --> 46:45.977
Stupid, my point being
that he wasn't actually

46:46.151 --> 46:47.282
too wounded to be moved.

46:47.979 --> 46:49.328
That woman executed him.

46:50.503 --> 46:52.592
See, that doesn't make
any fucking sense,

46:52.766 --> 46:55.029
because why would you
go through all of that effort

46:55.203 --> 46:56.248
just to kill the guy?

46:56.857 --> 46:58.119
That's what I'm saying.

46:58.816 --> 47:00.936
What if you weren't through
all that just to kill him?

47:04.343 --> 47:05.518
Fuck!

47:05.692 --> 47:08.564
Fuck! Fuck!

47:08.738 --> 47:12.133
I had to. I had to.
I had to. I had to.

47:12.917 --> 47:14.788
Even if it was
for a good reason,

47:14.962 --> 47:17.182
kill your own guy like that,
it had to fuck you up.

47:18.705 --> 47:20.750
He was in pretreatment
longer than us.

47:20.925 --> 47:22.448
Yeah, I know.
Like three months.

47:22.622 --> 47:23.686
What the fuck
were they doing with the guy?

47:23.710 --> 47:24.798
That place is hell.

47:26.234 --> 47:28.034
I don't know, I mean,
look what it did for us.

47:28.976 --> 47:30.499
I've got
almost a year sober now.

47:31.152 --> 47:32.371
- Congrats.
- Thank you.

47:32.545 --> 47:34.025
You're fucking nuts.

47:34.199 --> 47:35.809
Chris. Chris.

47:35.983 --> 47:37.898
Oh, fuck,
he fucking killed me that...

47:39.073 --> 47:42.207
Kyle. Kyle.
Kyle come here.

47:42.381 --> 47:43.948
- Please help me.
- I can't stand up.

47:44.122 --> 47:45.558
- I can't stand up.
- Kyle!

47:49.127 --> 47:52.217
Kyle and Lance just both left.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

47:52.391 --> 47:54.219
Oh God.

47:54.393 --> 47:55.742
Another one?

48:00.355 --> 48:02.096
You're slipping, Colonel.

48:02.967 --> 48:04.055
Show me.

48:05.056 --> 48:06.144
I said show me!

48:14.152 --> 48:15.196
Hey.

48:40.787 --> 48:41.875
Lance!

48:48.099 --> 48:49.187
Lance!

48:50.362 --> 48:53.060
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
it wasn't personal, man.

48:53.234 --> 48:55.410
- We gotta stop the bleeding.
- Okay. Okay.

49:01.677 --> 49:05.159
Oh fuck!

49:05.333 --> 49:06.378
Hey, cutie.

49:08.336 --> 49:10.860
Wait. Wait.
Wait. Hold on.

49:13.733 --> 49:15.213
I just wanna go home.

49:15.387 --> 49:16.736
Hey, don't do this.
Don't do this.

49:16.910 --> 49:18.216
- Hey, hey.
- I wanna go home.

49:18.390 --> 49:19.670
Let's go back
for Chris and Sara.

49:19.739 --> 49:20.739
No. Do you wanna live?

49:21.741 --> 49:22.916
I wanna live.

49:27.051 --> 49:28.182
Oh, fuck.

49:34.536 --> 49:36.321
We can't have much time left.

49:37.931 --> 49:40.107
You know that motherfucker
took the watch.

49:40.281 --> 49:41.717
Okay.

49:41.891 --> 49:44.155
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna go find anything

49:44.329 --> 49:45.609
that can help you
get outta here.

49:45.634 --> 49:46.809
All right?

49:47.375 --> 49:49.135
I didn't do anything.
Please, please, please.

49:49.203 --> 49:51.162
I didn't do anything.
You can take me away, okay?

49:51.336 --> 49:53.425
Red Dog one
this is Red Dog four.

49:53.599 --> 49:54.992
We got a live one, over.

49:55.166 --> 49:56.906
<i>Copy Red Dog four.</i>

49:57.081 --> 49:58.386
<i>How alive are we talking?</i>

49:59.997 --> 50:01.433
Red one this is Red four.

50:03.043 --> 50:04.610
She's got
a little kick in her left.

50:10.616 --> 50:12.096
Yeah, I wanna go home.

50:15.795 --> 50:18.493
- No, I am not leaving you here.
- Sara. Sara.

50:18.667 --> 50:19.755
Chris.

50:20.843 --> 50:22.643
What do you think
is gonna happen out there...

50:23.759 --> 50:25.152
realistically?

50:25.326 --> 50:28.199
No, no, no.
I am not leaving you.

50:28.373 --> 50:31.332
- Sara.
- I'm not, no, Chris.

50:31.506 --> 50:33.334
The best thing you can do is go.

50:33.508 --> 50:37.034
Lance, don't do that.

50:37.208 --> 50:40.559
Come on man.
Look, this is the river.

50:43.040 --> 50:44.345
You wanna go home?

50:50.003 --> 50:52.353
Shit! They are coming.

50:52.527 --> 50:53.615
Just fucking go.

50:54.399 --> 50:56.879
- Just fucking go.
- I'm sorry.

50:57.967 --> 51:01.014
I dunno how useful she'll be
for the program, over.

51:01.188 --> 51:02.972
I don't wanna die.
Please guys, please.

51:03.147 --> 51:04.800
<i>Woodman is priority one.</i>

51:04.974 --> 51:06.774
<i>Grab that target
move on to rally point Bravo.</i>

51:07.194 --> 51:08.369
Copy that.

51:08.543 --> 51:10.589
- Wait, wait, no, wait.
- Ah?

51:10.763 --> 51:12.323
Please, hey, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no.

51:22.644 --> 51:23.776
No, please. Please. Please.

51:23.950 --> 51:25.430
Hey, no, no, no, no, no.

51:25.604 --> 51:28.302
- No, no, come on.
- Lively one today.

51:28.476 --> 51:30.454
We're gonna work better
if we put our heads together.

51:30.478 --> 51:32.358
Let's just come up
with a different plan, Lance.

51:33.960 --> 51:35.309
You're crazy.

51:38.878 --> 51:40.706
Please, please. No. No. No!

51:43.361 --> 51:44.623
Whoo!

52:21.138 --> 52:23.444
<i>Remember, if Woodman
doesn't kill, you do.</i>

52:25.316 --> 52:26.621
I found one. I found one.

52:35.543 --> 52:36.849
Shitheels
must have deserted him.

52:40.505 --> 52:41.897
That what happen, boy?

52:42.071 --> 52:43.071
They leave ya?

52:43.203 --> 52:44.291
Fuck.

52:45.466 --> 52:47.076
Someone severed
your Achilles tendon.

52:48.469 --> 52:49.514
That's no fun.

52:56.521 --> 52:57.961
It's your show,
what do you wanna do?

53:00.829 --> 53:02.396
Hey, Junior,
can you give us a moment?

53:06.139 --> 53:07.184
You okay?

53:10.883 --> 53:12.711
<i>Blue Jay one, sitrep, over.</i>

53:16.280 --> 53:18.238
I just need
a private moment with him.

53:18.412 --> 53:20.109
Please, please, please.

53:20.980 --> 53:22.024
Attaboy.

53:28.030 --> 53:30.207
Please, don't.
Please, don't. Please, don't.

53:38.302 --> 53:40.260
Please, please.
You don't have to do it.

53:40.434 --> 53:42.219
Please let me go.
Please, please.

53:42.915 --> 53:44.395
Don't. Stop.

53:48.312 --> 53:49.487
Yes.

53:52.446 --> 53:53.926
Please.

53:59.801 --> 54:00.889
Stop!

54:22.520 --> 54:23.564
Excellent.

54:27.786 --> 54:28.830
Good work, soldier.

55:13.397 --> 55:14.920
<i>Red one, it's Red three.</i>

55:15.964 --> 55:17.270
<i>It's done, over.</i>

55:19.968 --> 55:21.056
Copy that.

55:23.363 --> 55:24.408
Come on.

55:28.063 --> 55:30.065
We'll push him back down
towards Price and Lipson.

55:30.762 --> 55:32.111
There you can
continue your work.

55:49.041 --> 55:50.347
Sara. Sara.

55:51.173 --> 55:53.175
Get off me.
What the hell? Get off me.

55:53.350 --> 55:54.786
- Get off me.
- Stop!

55:54.960 --> 55:55.787
- I'm saving you right now.
- Get off me!

55:55.961 --> 55:57.179
Why did you leave?

55:58.093 --> 56:01.140
Why didn't you come back?
Did you know that Chris died?

56:01.923 --> 56:03.011
Why?

56:04.535 --> 56:05.927
- Why?
- I came down here

56:06.101 --> 56:07.842
because Lance
took the map, okay?

56:08.016 --> 56:10.018
I was not leaving you.
I was coming back for you.

56:13.239 --> 56:16.329
And when I got down here,
I saw that.

56:21.900 --> 56:23.292
Oh, my God.

56:23.467 --> 56:25.556
- What happened to his...
- I don't know.

56:25.730 --> 56:27.253
My best guess
is that that charge

56:27.427 --> 56:29.298
detonated as soon
as he crossed the river.

56:31.518 --> 56:33.215
Must be some sort of fail-safe.

56:36.088 --> 56:37.648
They were
never gonna let us outta here.

56:39.744 --> 56:41.136
At least not across the river.

56:43.530 --> 56:44.575
So, what now?

56:46.403 --> 56:49.101
We stick together
and we survive.

57:08.076 --> 57:09.164
All right.

57:09.948 --> 57:11.906
Remember, we're here
to support Woodman.

57:12.080 --> 57:14.256
So let's try to make
the best of what we have left.

57:14.735 --> 57:16.615
Lipson, we're gonna need
your pathfinder skills.

57:16.694 --> 57:18.217
Try and track 'em
along the river,

57:18.391 --> 57:20.064
see if they diverted somewhere,
take Woodman.

57:20.088 --> 57:21.588
Price and I will
head to the high ground

57:21.612 --> 57:23.048
try to flush 'em down to you.

57:24.745 --> 57:25.833
Junior, go with Lipson.

57:27.008 --> 57:28.096
All right, let's move out.

57:33.624 --> 57:35.464
You sure we can fix
what's wrong with this guy?

57:36.496 --> 57:39.325
What did I tell you?
Don't worry about Woodman.

57:40.892 --> 57:42.023
Keep your head in the game.

57:51.859 --> 57:54.296
Hey, how long do you think
until we get to that mountain?

57:55.036 --> 57:56.821
I don't know,
about two trail miles

57:56.995 --> 57:59.040
before we clear the forest
and hit some foothills.

57:59.693 --> 58:01.521
Meaning?

58:01.695 --> 58:03.958
Sorry, uh, three more miles
till we reach higher ground.

58:06.395 --> 58:08.355
Do you think we could
get to the other side of it?

58:09.442 --> 58:10.835
Maybe there's
a town or something.

58:12.097 --> 58:14.578
I don't know.
But we gotta try, right?

58:16.231 --> 58:17.319
Right.

58:19.060 --> 58:20.105
Come on.

58:40.081 --> 58:41.641
Is all that shit
they said you did true?

58:42.431 --> 58:44.521
Depends what was said.

58:45.260 --> 58:47.045
Bet it was hard
to kill one of your own guys.

58:47.698 --> 58:49.134
Yeah, I could do it if I had to.

58:49.308 --> 58:50.352
You weren't there.

58:50.962 --> 58:52.311
Don't believe
everything you hear.

58:52.485 --> 58:54.226
- What happened?
- That's enough.

58:54.400 --> 58:56.445
Have some fucking respect.

58:56.924 --> 58:58.970
The trail's fresh here,
so we're about to engage.

59:01.320 --> 59:03.322
- There she is.
- Stop it.

59:03.801 --> 59:05.237
It's Woodman's shot.

59:05.411 --> 59:06.673
Practicing my aim.

59:24.038 --> 59:25.213
That's a mess.

59:25.387 --> 59:27.215
I prefer close quarters anyways.

59:27.389 --> 59:28.782
Fuck this!

59:55.766 --> 59:57.855
He's killing his own people.

59:58.507 --> 1:00:00.161
Motherfucker has gone crazy.

1:00:03.121 --> 1:00:04.296
Move.

1:00:07.516 --> 1:00:09.431
Somebody want to tell me
what the holy fuck

1:00:09.606 --> 1:00:10.911
is going on around here?

1:00:11.520 --> 1:00:13.610
Woodman is
going after everyone, sir.

1:00:15.829 --> 1:00:16.917
My program.

1:00:17.091 --> 1:00:18.136
Damn it!

1:00:20.007 --> 1:00:21.443
Come in, Woodman, over.

1:00:21.618 --> 1:00:23.073
He's removed
his tracking device, sir.

1:00:23.097 --> 1:00:24.577
Obviously.

1:00:27.536 --> 1:00:28.973
<i>Woodman, come in, over.</i>

1:00:31.628 --> 1:00:32.846
<i>Come in, Woodman, over.</i>

1:00:35.936 --> 1:00:38.722
<i>Woodman.
Come in, Woodman, over.</i>

1:00:46.251 --> 1:00:47.556
The fuck was that?

1:00:47.731 --> 1:00:48.949
- What?
- I don't know.

1:00:49.123 --> 1:00:50.690
I don't know.

1:00:50.864 --> 1:00:52.537
He's just...
He... he just... I got back...

1:00:52.561 --> 1:00:54.235
I gotta get outta here.
You don't understand.

1:00:54.259 --> 1:00:55.956
Look, look, look, I know...

1:00:56.130 --> 1:00:58.108
I know it's a lot to take in,
but we gotta stay calm.

1:00:58.132 --> 1:00:59.936
He's going after everybody.
I... I... gotta get outta here.

1:00:59.960 --> 1:01:01.372
I gotta... I gotta get back.
You don't understand.

1:01:01.396 --> 1:01:02.916
- Like, you don't understand.
- I know.

1:01:03.050 --> 1:01:04.419
Kyle, you just gotta...
You gotta breathe.

1:01:04.443 --> 1:01:07.141
Just stop.
Breathe, breathe, okay?

1:01:07.315 --> 1:01:08.752
Okay. Okay, okay.

1:01:09.361 --> 1:01:11.058
Okay? Okay?

1:01:11.232 --> 1:01:12.277
Yeah. Fuck!

1:01:15.759 --> 1:01:16.803
Okay.

1:01:22.417 --> 1:01:24.071
I don't recognize any of this.

1:01:25.159 --> 1:01:26.334
I don't know where we are.

1:01:27.901 --> 1:01:29.141
I don't know.
Lance had the map.

1:01:34.734 --> 1:01:37.389
We should go back to the place
they were holding us in.

1:01:40.392 --> 1:01:42.263
You want to go back
to those psychopaths?

1:01:42.786 --> 1:01:44.265
Yeah. Yeah.

1:01:44.439 --> 1:01:45.808
I mean, it's the only thing
I can think of.

1:01:45.832 --> 1:01:47.138
If they brought us in that way,

1:01:47.312 --> 1:01:48.748
then I bet
we can go out that way.

1:01:51.316 --> 1:01:53.144
That actually
fucking makes sense.

1:01:54.580 --> 1:01:56.380
And we just gotta
figure out how to get there.

1:02:03.720 --> 1:02:04.720
Oh, God.

1:02:23.870 --> 1:02:25.263
You lying down on duty, boy?

1:02:29.789 --> 1:02:31.095
You answer when I talk to you.

1:02:34.185 --> 1:02:35.229
God!

1:02:40.757 --> 1:02:41.801
You're a mess son.

1:02:43.803 --> 1:02:46.023
Look at these zips are undone.

1:02:50.636 --> 1:02:51.724
At ease, son.

1:03:14.355 --> 1:03:15.530
Hey, man.

1:03:16.227 --> 1:03:17.794
Stop! Top, Top.

1:03:17.968 --> 1:03:19.752
Jason! Jason!

1:03:20.709 --> 1:03:21.972
It's me.

1:03:27.020 --> 1:03:28.065
You with me?

1:03:29.631 --> 1:03:30.719
Are you with me?

1:03:36.551 --> 1:03:37.551
Let's go.

1:03:48.215 --> 1:03:49.216
Whose radio was that?

1:03:49.390 --> 1:03:50.696
Price.

1:03:50.870 --> 1:03:52.393
- Is he still on?
- Yes, sir.

1:03:53.307 --> 1:03:54.482
Why isn't he saying anything?

1:03:58.443 --> 1:03:59.531
Oh, God.

1:04:01.968 --> 1:04:04.318
Price.
Price come in, over.

1:04:06.494 --> 1:04:07.974
<i>Price.
Come in, Price.</i>

1:04:13.588 --> 1:04:15.808
Sir, Junior and Lipson are dead.

1:04:15.982 --> 1:04:18.115
<i>It's Woodman. He's gone rogue.</i>

1:04:18.289 --> 1:04:19.507
<i>Fall back to command.</i>

1:04:21.596 --> 1:04:23.598
We'll find him.

1:04:23.772 --> 1:04:25.774
<i>Negative. Negative.</i>

1:04:25.949 --> 1:04:28.734
<i>Fall back to command
and wait for QRF.</i>

1:04:30.518 --> 1:04:32.390
I'm sorry sir, but fuck that.

1:04:33.043 --> 1:04:36.176
We got it covered.
We want this one, over and out.

1:04:36.350 --> 1:04:38.265
<i>Negative.</i>

1:04:38.439 --> 1:04:42.095
<i>Rawlings respond. Rawlings,
the program is at stake.</i>

1:04:59.069 --> 1:05:01.134
I say we split up and we
flush this motherfucker out.

1:05:01.158 --> 1:05:02.202
Yeah.

1:05:07.816 --> 1:05:09.456
We need to get them
outta there right now.

1:05:09.514 --> 1:05:12.212
No, they stay.

1:05:13.344 --> 1:05:14.562
What did you just say to me?

1:05:14.736 --> 1:05:16.129
Those are my men out there.

1:05:16.303 --> 1:05:18.523
My program, my data.
They stay.

1:05:19.611 --> 1:05:21.352
They know
what they signed up for.

1:05:21.526 --> 1:05:24.137
You think because some
politician owes you a favor

1:05:24.311 --> 1:05:26.009
that you know
what's coming our direction?

1:05:26.183 --> 1:05:28.489
Because you don't.
You need to think again.

1:05:28.663 --> 1:05:30.361
Colonel...

1:05:30.535 --> 1:05:32.415
If the military wasn't
such a little boys' club,

1:05:32.493 --> 1:05:34.800
I doubt you would've ever been
let in in the first place.

1:05:36.149 --> 1:05:37.324
So, get back to work.

1:05:52.122 --> 1:05:53.601
I don't know where we are.

1:05:53.775 --> 1:05:55.342
I don't know
how I got so turned around.

1:05:55.516 --> 1:05:56.996
This is not working.

1:05:57.170 --> 1:05:58.713
It's okay.
Don't be so hard on yourself.

1:05:58.737 --> 1:06:00.913
- We'll get there.
- This is hopeless, Sara.

1:06:01.087 --> 1:06:02.393
Do you understand that?

1:06:02.567 --> 1:06:04.264
He is gonna find us and kill us.

1:06:04.438 --> 1:06:06.358
No, no, no, no. Stop, okay?
This is not hopeless.

1:06:06.832 --> 1:06:09.008
I didn't come this far to just
give up right now, okay?

1:06:09.182 --> 1:06:10.967
I am getting back to my son.

1:06:12.316 --> 1:06:13.316
You have a son?

1:06:21.760 --> 1:06:23.675
Woodman is still in the area,
sir, he's moving.

1:06:25.111 --> 1:06:27.940
- Get Zimieski in here.
- Zimieski, back to base.

1:06:55.185 --> 1:06:57.317
One. You go that way.

1:06:58.405 --> 1:06:59.885
I go the other way.

1:07:11.853 --> 1:07:13.507
No!

1:07:15.335 --> 1:07:16.728
- No!
- Thank you.

1:07:49.239 --> 1:07:50.457
This won't erase what you did.

1:09:06.185 --> 1:09:07.447
Eyes on Gravedigger.

1:09:09.449 --> 1:09:12.757
Stop. Stop.
I'm not going anywhere.

1:09:12.931 --> 1:09:14.324
It's time
to get you home, cowboy.

1:09:14.498 --> 1:09:15.803
- Let's do this.
- Stop!

1:09:15.977 --> 1:09:17.718
I am set to blow.

1:09:19.285 --> 1:09:20.895
You need to
get your boys outta here.

1:09:21.069 --> 1:09:22.332
I'm not leaving you.

1:09:22.506 --> 1:09:24.203
Listen, you fucking moron.

1:09:24.377 --> 1:09:27.946
If you try to move me,
you and your boys are dead.

1:09:30.644 --> 1:09:32.385
Look, we don't have time.

1:09:34.344 --> 1:09:35.910
I need you to finish me.

1:09:36.084 --> 1:09:37.738
I'm not doing that.

1:09:37.912 --> 1:09:40.828
I'm not asking you.
I'm telling you I am fucked.

1:09:42.569 --> 1:09:44.310
They've cut me in places.

1:09:45.572 --> 1:09:47.661
I can't even feel my legs.

1:09:50.577 --> 1:09:53.537
I need you to finish me.

1:09:55.887 --> 1:09:58.411
They don't win. I win.

1:10:03.199 --> 1:10:05.592
Are you a killer? Huh?

1:10:05.766 --> 1:10:07.942
Then do your goddamn job.

1:10:10.902 --> 1:10:12.686
No, we're not out yet.

1:10:16.168 --> 1:10:17.213
Look at me.

1:10:18.910 --> 1:10:20.172
It's okay.

1:10:25.177 --> 1:10:26.222
That's it.

1:10:27.223 --> 1:10:28.659
That's my boy.

1:10:30.791 --> 1:10:33.881
Thank you, son. Thank you.

1:10:54.250 --> 1:10:55.575
Sir,
inclement weather approaching.

1:10:55.599 --> 1:10:56.991
Possible rainfall.

1:10:57.165 --> 1:11:00.604
Rawlings, fall back, over.

1:11:00.778 --> 1:11:03.259
<i>Fall back.
Rawlings, fall back, over.</i>

1:11:24.062 --> 1:11:26.499
What the fuck is wrong
with Rawlings' equipment?

1:11:26.673 --> 1:11:28.849
It seems fine. It's stationary.
It must have come off.

1:11:29.023 --> 1:11:30.023
Fuck!

1:11:56.050 --> 1:11:58.096
Fuck you. Fuck AMACORP.

1:11:58.270 --> 1:12:00.577
You and your psycho
babble bullshit.

1:12:01.317 --> 1:12:03.275
The program was just mine
before you showed up.

1:12:03.449 --> 1:12:04.769
We could have saved
so many lives.

1:12:06.496 --> 1:12:09.934
This blood is on your hands,
not mine.

1:12:36.177 --> 1:12:37.527
- Abort the mission.
- No.

1:12:37.701 --> 1:12:38.789
Stay on task.

1:12:40.617 --> 1:12:41.661
Did I stutter?

1:12:42.923 --> 1:12:44.925
Abort the goddamn mission.

1:12:47.275 --> 1:12:48.973
Hey!

1:12:51.541 --> 1:12:54.370
We have not finished yet.

1:13:17.610 --> 1:13:19.046
You're out.

1:13:19.220 --> 1:13:20.352
I know.

1:13:26.097 --> 1:13:27.228
Yeah, me too.

1:13:35.323 --> 1:13:36.412
You bitch!

1:13:37.630 --> 1:13:39.327
You shot me.

1:13:41.199 --> 1:13:42.635
You're a coward.

1:13:46.117 --> 1:13:47.684
If you're gonna shoot a man...

1:13:48.859 --> 1:13:51.078
you shoot him face to face.

1:13:54.168 --> 1:13:56.954
Like I said,
we're not finished yet.

1:14:51.922 --> 1:14:53.053
He was my son.

1:16:35.242 --> 1:16:37.201
<i>Clear everything.</i>

1:16:37.375 --> 1:16:39.377
<i>Clear it all. You, with me?</i>

1:16:39.551 --> 1:16:40.639
Hurry up.

1:16:41.292 --> 1:16:42.467
How much time?

1:16:42.641 --> 1:16:43.860
It's almost done, ma'am.

1:16:47.037 --> 1:16:48.429
QRF in 45 mikes.

1:16:49.213 --> 1:16:50.562
What is it?

1:17:37.696 --> 1:17:38.741
Sara?

1:17:40.481 --> 1:17:43.571
You... you left me again.

1:17:43.746 --> 1:17:45.878
I'm sorry, I freaked out.

1:17:46.052 --> 1:17:48.968
I thought they got you.
But you made it. You're here.

1:17:49.142 --> 1:17:50.796
Get away from me.
Get away from me.

1:17:50.970 --> 1:17:52.450
No, no, no, no.
We need each other.

1:17:52.624 --> 1:17:53.886
Woodman is still out there.

1:17:56.497 --> 1:17:58.017
- Who are you talking about?
- The guy.

1:17:58.108 --> 1:17:59.979
The guy who was
killing everybody.

1:18:00.153 --> 1:18:02.434
I heard somebody say his name
when he was in here earlier.

1:18:06.594 --> 1:18:09.336
Look, I'm really sorry, okay?

1:18:09.510 --> 1:18:11.295
I am a coward. A piece of shit.

1:18:11.469 --> 1:18:14.124
There is no denying that.
We need to get out of here.

1:18:21.740 --> 1:18:23.655
Whoa!

1:18:23.829 --> 1:18:26.049
Look, I can explain.
I can explain.

1:18:26.223 --> 1:18:27.615
Explain what?

1:18:27.790 --> 1:18:29.269
I was just
doing my duty, all right?

1:18:29.443 --> 1:18:31.184
I was ordered.

1:18:31.358 --> 1:18:33.249
You don't understand.
It's a program to help vets.

1:18:33.273 --> 1:18:34.448
It is a good thing.

1:18:34.622 --> 1:18:35.841
You were with them...

1:18:37.190 --> 1:18:38.409
the whole time?

1:18:39.540 --> 1:18:42.326
I was just doing my job.

1:18:42.500 --> 1:18:43.893
Sara, look at me.

1:18:44.067 --> 1:18:45.764
Look at me, Sara.

1:18:45.938 --> 1:18:48.419
Sara, look at me. Look.

1:18:50.551 --> 1:18:52.031
No.

1:18:52.205 --> 1:18:53.805
Don't do it, please.
Don't do it, please.

1:18:54.686 --> 1:18:56.296
My job is to be the fail-safe.

1:18:57.558 --> 1:18:59.647
Make sure you stay
on the hunting grounds.

1:19:02.041 --> 1:19:05.044
Make sure these veterans
get the help that they need.

1:19:05.218 --> 1:19:06.742
Please don't do this.
Please.

1:19:09.483 --> 1:19:10.963
The program helps.

1:19:12.182 --> 1:19:14.271
Why couldn't you just
die like the rest of them?

1:20:10.196 --> 1:20:11.284
Sara.

1:20:12.155 --> 1:20:14.026
Sara, come on.

1:20:14.200 --> 1:20:16.420
Sara, Sara, Sara.

1:20:18.639 --> 1:20:20.095
Hey, hey, hey. It's okay.
It's okay. You're fine.

1:20:20.119 --> 1:20:21.251
You're fine. It's okay.

1:20:21.773 --> 1:20:24.471
Chris, I heard you dying.

1:20:24.645 --> 1:20:26.125
- I know.
- No, no, no.

1:20:26.299 --> 1:20:28.258
- I heard you dying.
- I know. I know.

1:20:28.432 --> 1:20:29.737
What happened?

1:20:30.564 --> 1:20:31.609
He saved my life.

1:20:33.306 --> 1:20:34.438
Who?

1:20:35.526 --> 1:20:36.614
Him.

1:20:38.485 --> 1:20:40.618
- Woodman.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

1:20:40.792 --> 1:20:42.663
He's the only reason
why I'm still alive.

1:20:42.838 --> 1:20:43.926
No, no, your face.

1:20:44.100 --> 1:20:45.492
He's not a good man.

1:20:45.666 --> 1:20:47.146
He had to make it
look real or else

1:20:47.320 --> 1:20:48.515
he would've
had to really kill me.

1:20:48.539 --> 1:20:50.019
I don't believe you.

1:20:50.193 --> 1:20:51.629
That piece of shit,
he hunted us.

1:20:51.803 --> 1:20:53.152
He hunted us.

1:20:53.326 --> 1:20:55.111
He had to make it seem that way.

1:20:55.285 --> 1:20:57.461
He's here to shut
down the program, okay?

1:20:57.635 --> 1:20:59.115
- What?
- Yeah.

1:20:59.811 --> 1:21:01.073
What?

1:21:02.422 --> 1:21:04.250
Okay, what is this
program exactly?

1:21:08.864 --> 1:21:10.953
This program is meant
to get us back to killing.

1:21:12.084 --> 1:21:13.694
Plain and simple.

1:21:13.869 --> 1:21:15.871
Military can't lose
their investments.

1:21:17.220 --> 1:21:18.438
So then, why did you help us?

1:21:21.311 --> 1:21:23.182
I did something
I could never take back.

1:21:28.666 --> 1:21:29.666
You remind me of her.

1:21:46.423 --> 1:21:49.556
<i>I must congratulate you, Marcus.</i>

1:21:49.730 --> 1:21:52.690
<i>You are far more dangerous
than even I expected.</i>

1:21:52.864 --> 1:21:54.822
You know, one thing
I learned many years ago

1:21:54.997 --> 1:21:56.955
is there are no accidents.

1:21:57.129 --> 1:21:59.653
It was no accident
that you were selected

1:21:59.827 --> 1:22:01.655
for that mission
all those years ago.

1:22:04.136 --> 1:22:07.574
<i>It was no accident
that my colleague was tortured</i>

1:22:07.748 --> 1:22:09.533
<i>so close to death.</i>

1:22:11.187 --> 1:22:12.840
And it was no accident

1:22:13.015 --> 1:22:16.844
that you were forced
to make an impossible decision.

1:22:17.019 --> 1:22:19.412
<i>I suppose
you saved us all in the end.</i>

1:22:19.586 --> 1:22:21.066
It's okay.

1:22:25.201 --> 1:22:28.117
<i>You see, I never
wanted to cure PTSD.</i>

1:22:28.291 --> 1:22:32.730
I wanted to harness it,
turn it into a weapon.

1:22:32.904 --> 1:22:35.820
<i>That old man
tried to stop my program.</i>

1:22:36.647 --> 1:22:37.691
He had to go.

1:22:38.518 --> 1:22:40.433
And I saw an opportunity.

1:22:42.174 --> 1:22:45.743
<i>Marcus, I have been in your head</i>

1:22:45.917 --> 1:22:48.093
since before
you even you knew my name.

1:22:48.267 --> 1:22:50.400
Breaking you down.

1:22:50.574 --> 1:22:51.792
Mind if hang out over here?

1:22:51.967 --> 1:22:53.098
Clearing the field.

1:22:55.144 --> 1:22:58.756
You were the key to the true
Stalking Fields Program.

1:22:58.930 --> 1:23:01.150
The one I designed.

1:23:01.324 --> 1:23:03.891
And now, thanks to you,
I have everything I need

1:23:04.066 --> 1:23:07.939
to show those bureaucrats
how effective it is.

1:23:08.113 --> 1:23:11.943
<i>Give a man a purpose he'll
turn into a ferocious dog.</i>

1:23:12.117 --> 1:23:14.641
<i>Just like I gave you when...</i>

1:23:14.815 --> 1:23:16.774
<i>When I killed
your wife and child.</i>

1:23:18.428 --> 1:23:20.734
<i>Claver said they died slowly.</i>

1:23:25.696 --> 1:23:26.871
Car trouble?

1:23:35.358 --> 1:23:36.750
I'll drive next time.

1:23:38.883 --> 1:23:42.669
<i>You see, there are no accidents.</i>

1:23:42.843 --> 1:23:45.455
<i>Your rage
gave me my life's work.</i>

1:23:45.629 --> 1:23:48.632
<i>And in exchange
I give you your life.</i>

1:23:50.373 --> 1:23:52.940
<i>You just remember that, Marcus.</i>

1:23:53.115 --> 1:23:54.594
<i>If you ever get the itch</i>

1:23:54.768 --> 1:23:57.249
<i>to come back
to the stalking fields.</i>

1:24:03.212 --> 1:24:04.430
I'm so sorry.

1:24:17.008 --> 1:24:18.966
<i>QRF on site.</i>

1:24:19.141 --> 1:24:20.640
- Come on. Let's go.
- Hey, hey, hey man.

1:24:20.664 --> 1:24:23.014
Come on.
Hey man. Snap out of it.

1:24:24.668 --> 1:24:26.017
Look, I know you're hurt,

1:24:26.191 --> 1:24:27.751
but we can't do anything
if you're dead.

1:24:27.845 --> 1:24:29.475
We... we need your help
to get out of this.

1:24:29.499 --> 1:24:30.674
Come on.

1:24:35.070 --> 1:24:37.376
Marcus. Marcus.

1:24:37.550 --> 1:24:40.031
<i>QRF on site.</i>

1:24:46.951 --> 1:24:49.171
<i>QRF on site.</i>

1:24:56.178 --> 1:24:57.222
You got this.

1:24:58.223 --> 1:24:59.355
You got this.

1:25:06.884 --> 1:25:08.190
You need to go.
