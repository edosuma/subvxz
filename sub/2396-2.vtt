ON THE FRESHMAN 15?

34:13.280 --> 34:16.340
YOU CAN'T HEAR SIX PEOPLE
JUMP OUT OF A WINDOW?

34:16.380 --> 34:19.486
WE'RE GONNA LOSE THIS NOW,
AND IT'S ON YOU TWO.

34:22.560 --> 34:24.778
NOW,
WITH THE ZETA THETA SISTERS

34:24.830 --> 34:26.457
ALL OFF SOMEWHERE VOTING,

34:26.490 --> 34:29.323
TIME TO SEE
WHAT'S IN THE MYSTERY ROOM.

34:49.320 --> 34:52.642
HOLY SMOKES.

35:00.760 --> 35:02.489
UN-FREAKING-BELIEVABLE.

35:02.530 --> 35:04.361
THIS IS AWESOME, VERONICA.

35:04.400 --> 35:06.766
THANKS.
AND THE SECRET PARTIES
WITH THE BOOZE AND DUDES?

35:06.800 --> 35:09.360
WE'RE TALKING
ONE GREEK HOUSE DOWN,

35:09.400 --> 35:11.129
NINE TO GO.

35:11.170 --> 35:12.865
YEAH, YOU KNOW,
THEY WEREN'T ALL BAD.

35:12.910 --> 35:15.606
YOU'RE GONNA BE A REAL ASSET
TO US HERE, VERONICA.

35:15.640 --> 35:18.507
YOU'RE ONE OF US NOW.

35:18.550 --> 35:21.417
HOW ARE YOU NOT PEEING?!

35:21.450 --> 35:24.180
YOU DOWNED AN ENTIRE BIG GULP
AT THE FOOD COURT,

35:24.220 --> 35:26.780
AND NOW YOU CAN'T GO?!

35:26.820 --> 35:30.483
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?!

35:30.520 --> 35:32.659
IT'S 114th AND JAMESTOWN.

35:32.690 --> 35:33.827
DUDE!

35:33.860 --> 35:35.725
ONLY 10 HOURS TO GO,
AND YOU CAVED!

35:35.760 --> 35:37.523
LEAVE HIM ALONE.

35:41.940 --> 35:43.339
WE NEED TO TALK.

35:44.640 --> 35:46.301
ABOUT WHAT?

35:46.340 --> 35:48.308
KAREN HAS CANCER.

35:48.340 --> 35:50.308
SHE SAW YOU GO
INTO HER PRIVATE ROOM.

35:50.340 --> 35:52.501
THERE'S A SECOND CAMERA
INSIDE.

35:52.550 --> 35:53.949
WHAT WERE
YOU LOOKING FOR?

35:53.980 --> 35:56.448
THE TRUTH?

35:56.480 --> 35:57.811
IF IT'S NOT TOO MUCH
TO ASK.

35:57.850 --> 36:01.684
A FRIEND --
SOMEONE I KNOW --

36:01.720 --> 36:04.951
WAS RAPED AFTER SHE LEFT
A THETA BETA PARTY.

36:04.990 --> 36:07.379
I THOUGHT THERE MIGHT BE A CLUE
BEHIND THAT DOOR.

36:07.430 --> 36:09.728
WHAT'S BEHIND THAT DOOR

36:09.760 --> 36:12.320
HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH THE RAPE OF PARKER LEE.

36:12.370 --> 36:14.361
SO THE POT FARM...

36:14.400 --> 36:16.265
KAREN WAS SO SICK
FROM THE CHEMO,

36:16.300 --> 36:18.666
SHE SPENT THE DAY LAYING ON THE
FLOOR IN FRONT OF THE TOILET.

36:18.710 --> 36:20.268
WE GOT HER A DOG BED

36:20.310 --> 36:22.232
SO AT LEAST SHE COULD
LAY ON SOMETHING SOFT.

36:22.280 --> 36:24.840
THIS BOTANY-PROFESSOR FRIEND
OF HERS GAVE HER SOME SEEDS.

36:24.880 --> 36:27.440
HE SAID IT WOULD HELP WITH
THE PAIN AND THE NAUSEA,

36:27.480 --> 36:28.913
AND IT DID.

36:28.950 --> 36:31.441
SHE WON'T JUST LOSE HER JOB
OVER THIS, VERONICA.

36:31.490 --> 36:32.809
SHE'LL LOSE HER INSURANCE.

36:32.850 --> 36:37.412
PLEASE DON'T SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT WHAT YOU SAW.

36:40.030 --> 36:42.328
I HELD OUT AS LONG
AS I COULD, GUYS...

36:42.360 --> 36:43.429
REALLY.

36:43.460 --> 36:45.667
COME ON.
GIVE THE GUY A BREAK.

36:45.700 --> 36:47.327
YOU RANG?

36:47.370 --> 36:50.567

FALSE INFORMATION.

36:54.940 --> 36:58.205

BUT I KNOW THIS WAS YOU.

37:11.760 --> 37:13.682
NISH, IT'S VERONICA.
LISTEN TO ME --

37:13.730 --> 37:16.449
YOU CAN'T PRINT THAT STORY.
I MADE A HUGE MISTAKE.

37:16.500 --> 37:17.592
WHAT MISTAKE?

37:17.630 --> 37:19.621
THEIR DEN MOTHER
HAS CANCER.

37:19.670 --> 37:21.865
SHE'S GROWING MARIJUANA
FOR MEDICAL REASONS.

37:21.900 --> 37:24.368
SHE GOT THE SEEDS
FROM A BOTANY PROFESSOR

37:24.410 --> 37:25.502
WHO WAS TRYING TO HELP HER.

37:25.540 --> 37:27.030
AND THE PARTY?

37:27.070 --> 37:28.378
The underage drinking?

37:28.410 --> 37:29.877
LOOK, CAN YOU JUST
GIVE ME A DAY

37:29.910 --> 37:31.343
SO I CAN VERIFY SOME FACTS?

37:31.380 --> 37:33.871
As far as I'm concerned,
the facts are here.

37:33.910 --> 37:36.049
THE ARTICLE'S BEING PUBLISHED,
VERONICA.

37:36.080 --> 37:38.310
You should be proud.

37:40.050 --> 37:41.244
[ KNOCK ON DOOR ]

37:44.560 --> 37:47.256
KAREN, I'M SO SORRY.

37:49.660 --> 37:51.969
THERE'S GOING TO BE
AN ARTICLE

37:52.000 --> 37:54.639
IN THE SCHOOL NEWSPAPER
TOMORROW.

37:54.670 --> 37:57.468
YOU NEED TO GET RID OF THE
MARIJUANA BEFORE IT COMES OUT.

38:03.580 --> 38:07.072
YOU WANT TO KNOW
THE DEFINITION OF "IRONIC"?

38:07.110 --> 38:08.771
YOU GOT VOTED IN,
VERONICA.

38:08.820 --> 38:11.345
WE WANTED YOU
TO BE ONE OF US.

38:20.130 --> 38:22.428
I LEFT YOU A CARD

38:22.460 --> 38:24.928
WITH, LIKE,
MY NUMBERS AND STUFF,

38:24.970 --> 38:26.494
IF YOU WANT.

38:28.970 --> 38:31.666
I THOUGHT WE WERE GONNA HAVE
A BLAST TOGETHER.

38:31.710 --> 38:33.735
NOW EVERYTHING'S RUINED.

38:33.770 --> 38:35.772
DON'T GO.

38:37.380 --> 38:39.701
NOTHING'S RUINED.

38:39.750 --> 38:43.743
BUT I THINK IF YOU GO
WITH YOUR PARENTS, IT WILL BE.

38:43.780 --> 38:45.839
STAY HERE.

38:45.890 --> 38:47.482
I'LL HAVE YOUR BACK
FROM NOW ON.

39:16.950 --> 39:19.145
YOU GOT TO TELL US
WHAT THAT ADDRESS WAS.

39:19.190 --> 39:20.612
NO.

39:20.650 --> 39:22.413
IT'S 116th STREET
AND JAMESON BOULEVARD.

39:22.460 --> 39:24.826
STICK THAT
IN YOUR TROPHY CASE, BABY.

39:24.860 --> 39:27.579
CONGRATULATIONS, GUARDS.
YOU'VE WON.

39:27.630 --> 39:29.495
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
IT'S 6:03.

39:29.530 --> 39:31.157
IT'S 5:45.

39:31.200 --> 39:34.169
THE TWO GUARDS WHO FELL ASLEEP
ON DUTY WERE JUST PRETENDING.

39:34.200 --> 39:37.033
THEY WAITED FOR THE PRISONERS
TO ESCAPE

39:37.070 --> 39:38.935
AND THEN MOVED
THE CLOCK FORWARD.

39:38.970 --> 39:40.631
SEE YOU IN CLASS.

39:44.710 --> 39:46.109
AND YOU DIDN'T TELL ME?

39:46.150 --> 39:49.142

HERE'S THE KNOWLEDGE
I'VE ACCUMULATED

40:07.170 --> 40:08.990
MY FIRST WEEK AT HEARST --

40:09.040 --> 40:11.759
CHIP DILLER SEEMS TO BE AROUND
WHEN THE RAPES OCCUR,

40:11.810 --> 40:14.677
THE SAFETY OF THE SAFE RIDE
HOME IS QUESTIONABLE,

40:14.710 --> 40:16.530
AND SOMEONE IN THE THETA BETAS

40:16.580 --> 40:19.469
HAD THE KEYS TO PARKER'S ROOM
THE NIGHT OF HER RAPE.

40:19.510 --> 40:20.909
IT'S A START.

40:23.650 --> 40:25.049

I NEED YOU TO DO SOMETHING
FOR ME.

I THINK
YOU'LL CHANGE YOUR MIND.
