was participating in illegal

He also got Orlando,

07:12.868 --> 07:15.070
thinks he's the one
that killed Raul

07:15.137 --> 07:16.805
because he lost the fight.

07:16.872 --> 07:18.773
Look, Orlando's not a killer.

07:18.841 --> 07:20.642
I need you to prove that.

07:20.710 --> 07:22.177
You're certain
he's innocent, are you?

07:22.244 --> 07:25.914

Connor's when Raul was killed.

Please, man.

07:45.301 --> 07:46.768
He's like a brother to me.

07:46.836 --> 07:48.670
All right, you tell
Marshall that the FBI

07:48.738 --> 07:50.805
are all over him
on this one, all right?

07:50.873 --> 07:53.541
The last thing he needs is another
corpse on his hands, all right?

07:53.609 --> 07:54.809
That's it?

07:54.877 --> 07:56.845
Yep. Best I can do.

07:56.912 --> 07:59.147
Good luck.
See yourself out.

the DNA results, Ben.

08:44.727 --> 08:45.827

08:45.895 --> 08:48.496
Yeah. At the very least,
we need to mismanage 'em.

So you think that I'm gonna interfere
with a federal investigation?

08:51.267 --> 08:52.100
Yeah.

08:52.168 --> 08:53.435
That's not gonna happen.

08:53.502 --> 08:55.336
Lightman, if you're innocent,

08:55.404 --> 08:56.337
just... just come clean.

08:56.405 --> 08:57.272
Well, I would,

08:57.339 --> 08:59.407
wouldn't I,
but that tosser Dillon,

08:59.475 --> 09:02.343
he's got it in for me.

09:02.411 --> 09:05.246
If he finds out
that I'm prime suspect,

09:05.314 --> 09:07.248
he's gonna push for an arrest,

09:07.316 --> 09:10.018
and I'm gonna lose
custody of Emily.

09:10.085 --> 09:11.519
So...

09:11.587 --> 09:14.956
I need a bit more time.

09:51.360 --> 09:52.527

the clarity's terrible,

09:52.595 --> 09:56.197
so I'm trying to enhance
it, see if I can...

09:56.265 --> 09:58.733
if I can get a better read
on the crowd, uh,

09:58.801 --> 10:01.369
see if anybody's showing
any hostility towards Raul.

10:01.437 --> 10:02.904
Mind if I sit in?

10:04.106 --> 10:07.709
Uh, well, it usually
takes a couple hours, so...

10:07.776 --> 10:09.911
Ok. Well, I'm gonna
stick around for it,

10:09.979 --> 10:11.946

10:12.014 --> 10:13.748

10:17.586 --> 10:19.287

where Lightman went?

10:30.699 --> 10:32.200
He went that way.

10:34.537 --> 10:35.904

is look after your fighter!

10:35.971 --> 10:37.438

I'm tryin' to do!

10:41.944 --> 10:43.111
Lightman: Hey!

10:44.313 --> 10:45.547
Am I interrupting something?

10:45.614 --> 10:48.883
What about "do not disturb"
don't you understand?

10:48.951 --> 10:50.351
You tell him about me, did you?

10:50.419 --> 10:53.454
Yo, I thought you said
you weren't interested.

10:55.691 --> 10:58.359
You know, Simone tells
me that you read faces,

10:58.427 --> 10:59.961
you're some sort of scientist.

11:00.029 --> 11:02.564
That's why you come
to all my fights?

11:02.631 --> 11:04.098
All right, Raul the upstart,

11:04.166 --> 11:06.768
he gives Orlando
a kicking in the ring,

11:06.835 --> 11:09.704
and Orlando does him in.
Is that it?

11:09.772 --> 11:12.006
Yeah. You haven't
read his face yet.

11:12.074 --> 11:13.741
I thought you'd never ask.
Where is he?

11:13.809 --> 11:16.144
That's not a good sign,
your eyes.

11:16.211 --> 11:18.780
You're the only judge and jury
he's ever gonna see, ain't you?

11:18.847 --> 11:20.114
Get him out of here.

11:20.182 --> 11:21.449
Yeah, keep your eyes stiff.

11:21.517 --> 11:22.617
I might not be able
to control myself.

11:22.685 --> 11:23.785
He's in there, isn't he?

11:23.852 --> 11:24.686
Business is business.

11:24.753 --> 11:26.087
Wouldn't it be better business

11:26.155 --> 11:28.623
if you found out if Orlando
was the real killer

11:28.691 --> 11:30.158
before you did him in?

11:31.827 --> 11:34.028
Shall we?

11:39.902 --> 11:42.136
[Panting]

11:42.204 --> 11:44.672
[Speaking spanish]

11:46.675 --> 11:48.643
Ah, shut up.

11:50.613 --> 11:52.113
So, anything I say,

11:52.181 --> 11:54.248
you're gonna get the
truth out of him, is it?

11:54.316 --> 11:58.319
I don't need you to tell
me how to do my business.

11:58.387 --> 11:59.554
Got it?

12:01.790 --> 12:02.657
Yeah.

12:02.725 --> 12:06.461
Now look... look at me, all right?

12:06.528 --> 12:07.862
Now, Simone says that you were

12:07.930 --> 12:09.797
shootin' pool there last night.
Is that right?

12:09.865 --> 12:12.900
I was at my girl's house,
Lucia,

12:12.968 --> 12:14.769
all night long.

12:15.971 --> 12:18.106
She made anticuchos.

12:20.009 --> 12:21.242
Well, I'm sold.

12:21.310 --> 12:25.013
Yeah. I mean, scientifically
speaking, that is.

12:25.080 --> 12:27.281
Explain the science to me.

12:28.250 --> 12:29.550
What?

12:30.586 --> 12:33.054
You don't think I'd
be able to follow?

12:33.122 --> 12:36.290
Right. Well, look at him,
all right?

12:36.358 --> 12:39.327
I mean, he's not scared of you.

12:39.395 --> 12:41.729
All right? I mean,
that's contempt, that is.

12:41.797 --> 12:43.798
He thinks you're
just another pansy.

12:44.867 --> 12:47.068
You can't fight like a man.

12:47.136 --> 12:49.437
I mean, there's nothing more
that he'd like to do

12:49.505 --> 12:51.005
than tell you
that he killed Raul,

12:51.073 --> 12:54.776
if only to look you in the eye
and show you what a real man is.

12:54.843 --> 12:56.010
Do you follow?

12:56.078 --> 12:57.645
Man: Boss.

12:57.713 --> 12:59.247
What?!

12:59.314 --> 13:01.582
Boss, we got
a situation out here.

13:01.650 --> 13:03.851
Boss, it's serious!

13:03.919 --> 13:05.987
[Grunts] I didn't kill Raul.

13:06.055 --> 13:08.489
Don't get up.

13:09.992 --> 13:11.159
[Door closes]

13:13.929 --> 13:16.597
Man: Found her
wandering in here.

13:17.466 --> 13:19.133
Says she knows you.

13:19.201 --> 13:20.601
Who, me?

13:21.837 --> 13:23.004
That true?

13:24.440 --> 13:27.008
I never seen her before
in my life.

13:31.269 --> 13:33.471
My name's Sabrina.

13:33.538 --> 13:35.806
I, uh... I heard you were
lookin' for fighters.

13:39.344 --> 13:40.411
Who told you that?

13:40.479 --> 13:44.849
Oh. Yeah. We might
have met her.

13:44.916 --> 13:49.887
At that, um... that karaoke place in that dump.
What was it called?

13:49.955 --> 13:50.888
Hyattsville.
There it is.

13:50.956 --> 13:51.989
Yeah. Yeah, right.

13:52.057 --> 13:53.991
Damn girl, you clean up good.

13:54.059 --> 13:56.293
I barely recognized you.

13:56.361 --> 13:59.096
Yo, you gotta see the
hand speed on this one.

13:59.164 --> 14:00.164
Ridiculous, for real.

14:00.232 --> 14:01.832
Yeah. [sniffs]

14:01.900 --> 14:03.133
I don't meet fighters here.

14:03.201 --> 14:04.268
You never came here,

14:04.336 --> 14:06.971
and you never come here again.
You got me?

14:07.973 --> 14:09.507
Go.

14:10.942 --> 14:12.710
Now what about Orlando?

14:14.846 --> 14:18.148
Orlando stays with me.

14:22.053 --> 14:23.821
Are you out of your tiny mind?

14:23.889 --> 14:24.922
Hey, not that tiny.

14:24.990 --> 14:27.258
I just cut you out of
an incriminating video.

14:27.325 --> 14:28.259
Oh, yeah?

14:28.326 --> 14:29.326
Yeah. Someone filmed you

14:29.394 --> 14:30.828
on their cell phone
at the fight last night,

14:30.896 --> 14:32.963
so I thought I'd come over
here and give you a heads-up.

14:33.031 --> 14:34.431
Well, you could have
called me, couldn't you?

14:34.499 --> 14:36.333
Well, I tried,
like, about 10 times.

14:36.401 --> 14:38.502
And now the FBI's saying that
they're gonna post a reward

14:38.570 --> 14:40.971
for any more footage, so I
don't know what you're up to,

14:41.039 --> 14:43.040
but you don't have much
time before they find you.

14:43.108 --> 14:45.709
All right. Well,
just let them find me, then.

14:45.777 --> 14:47.011
You don't really mean that.

14:47.078 --> 14:50.247
Look, I go to those fights
just to look at the faces.

14:50.315 --> 14:52.716
Right. And you read "playboy"
just for the articles.

14:52.784 --> 14:54.018
Don't be daft.

14:56.254 --> 14:57.254
Look at you.

14:57.322 --> 15:00.357
You're all wired up
after your Sabrina act.

15:00.425 --> 15:02.026
Yeah. Takes one
to know one.

15:02.093 --> 15:05.262
You're off this, Torres.
I mean that, right?

15:05.330 --> 15:06.463
Did they come out yet?

15:06.531 --> 15:07.965
2 of Marshall's men just left,

15:08.033 --> 15:09.700
but he's still in there
with Orlando,

15:09.768 --> 15:11.902
who's a dead man for
something he didn't do.

15:11.970 --> 15:14.805
No, he's not innocent in this.
He's up to his ears.

15:14.873 --> 15:16.774
I'll see you
back at the office, right?

15:16.841 --> 15:18.676
Yeah. Pleasure's
all mine, by the way.

15:18.743 --> 15:19.877
No need to thank me.

15:19.945 --> 15:21.745
You're off this.
I mean it.

15:21.813 --> 15:22.913
I mean it, Torres.

15:22.981 --> 15:24.949
[Line rings]

15:25.016 --> 15:26.917

[Knock on door]

15:28.186 --> 15:29.119
Hi.

15:29.187 --> 15:30.921
Hey.

15:30.989 --> 15:32.790
Receptionist stepped away.

15:32.857 --> 15:35.125
No one saw me come in, so...

15:35.193 --> 15:37.394
Your secret is safe.

15:39.764 --> 15:41.231
What's the occasion?

15:41.299 --> 15:42.900
I have to cancel tonight.

15:42.968 --> 15:44.735
Um, some potential
foster parents

15:44.803 --> 15:48.172
are coming to the youth center,
and I have to interview 'em.

15:48.239 --> 15:50.674
I brought this...

15:50.742 --> 15:53.210
To buy your forgiveness.

15:53.278 --> 15:54.445
Oh.

15:54.512 --> 15:55.679
I'm sorry.

15:55.747 --> 15:59.650
I'll make it up to you.

15:59.718 --> 16:01.919
I promise.

16:15.166 --> 16:18.235
[Line rings]

16:18.303 --> 16:19.803
Man: Forensics.

16:19.871 --> 16:22.106
Yeah. This is
Agent Carl Washington.

16:22.173 --> 16:25.109
Yeah, I need you
to pull that rush order

16:25.176 --> 16:27.845
off of DNA sample 2699b.

16:27.912 --> 16:31.015
Yeah, that's right.
The Raul Campos case.

16:31.082 --> 16:32.783
Yeah. We're checking
right now

16:32.851 --> 16:35.119
to see if the sample
was contaminated.

16:35.186 --> 16:37.087
All right. Thank you.

16:40.458 --> 16:41.458
What are you doin' here?

16:41.526 --> 16:43.594
Was, uh, just lookin'
for Lightman.

16:43.662 --> 16:45.629
Yeah, you and me both.

16:45.697 --> 16:47.931
Oh, we, uh... we found
the next of kin.

16:47.999 --> 16:50.334
Raul was wiring money
to an aunt in Peru.

16:50.402 --> 16:52.536
She said his brother's
here lookin' for him.

16:52.604 --> 16:53.604
Foster's waiting for you.

16:53.672 --> 16:56.740
All right. I'll be
right there, sir.

17:03.381 --> 17:05.549
My brother left a year ago

17:05.617 --> 17:08.018
after a fight with my father.

17:09.621 --> 17:11.622
Nobody knows where he went.

17:11.690 --> 17:13.656
We all miss him.

17:13.724 --> 17:17.461
Reynolds: So what did he and
your father fight about?

17:19.931 --> 17:22.266
I can't really remember.

17:24.736 --> 17:26.569
I think you do.

17:26.637 --> 17:28.505
Why don't you tell us?

17:29.674 --> 17:32.176
He wanted to be a rich man.

17:33.044 --> 17:35.679
That's why he came here.

17:37.615 --> 17:39.550
My father was angry about that.

17:39.617 --> 17:41.085
He called it irresponsible.

17:41.152 --> 17:43.053
It bothered you, too.

17:43.922 --> 17:46.356
It was selfish.

17:46.424 --> 17:49.226
He wanted to walk away
from his obligations,

17:49.294 --> 17:51.195
from his family.

17:51.262 --> 17:53.997
I should have never
have encouraged him.

17:55.834 --> 17:57.901
How are you feeling?

18:00.839 --> 18:03.040
Like my soul's
been ripped away.

18:10.181 --> 18:12.349
Just Marshall and the main guy.

18:13.218 --> 18:14.651
You got a light?

18:16.855 --> 18:18.455
You clear everything
out of the office?

18:18.523 --> 18:19.757
Yeah. We're good.

put it out, bring...

Come on. Come on.

18:57.262 --> 18:58.495
All right?

18:58.563 --> 19:00.497
Get him out of here.

19:05.258 --> 19:07.893
Can I get, um,
3 club sodas, please, darlin'.

19:10.529 --> 19:13.431
All right, Orlando,

19:13.499 --> 19:16.434
the reason I saved your ass...

19:17.670 --> 19:20.271
All right, was so I could
ask you this question.

19:20.339 --> 19:21.272
Why'd you kill Raul?

19:21.340 --> 19:23.041
I didn't kill nobody.

19:25.044 --> 19:27.011
Look at me when you say that.

19:27.079 --> 19:29.314
Come on. I dare you.
Look at me.

19:30.683 --> 19:32.317
Nah. You see,
save your breath.

19:32.384 --> 19:34.419
'Cause your eyes just did
the talking for you.

19:34.486 --> 19:37.388
I just accused you of murder...

19:37.456 --> 19:39.991
Right? And you're more worried
about what she's thinking.

19:40.059 --> 19:41.559
Why is that?
You think that she killed Raul?

19:41.627 --> 19:42.660
Is that it?

19:42.728 --> 19:45.663
Yo, get real. Why would
I off another fighter?

19:49.234 --> 19:55.640
You know, I think she's got your
nuggets in a vise, Orlando.

19:55.708 --> 19:57.342
You wanna talk to me
about that?

19:57.409 --> 19:59.177
I just didn't...

20:01.213 --> 20:02.280
thank you, love.

20:02.348 --> 20:05.683
I just didn't wanna let
her down, all right?

20:05.751 --> 20:07.085
After all you done for me,

20:07.152 --> 20:08.920
I just don't wanna
disappoint you.

20:09.722 --> 20:10.989
You know, I don't think

20:11.056 --> 20:12.623
you're dead from the neck up.

20:12.691 --> 20:15.426
What is that supposed to mean?

20:15.494 --> 20:17.061
Did you throw the fight?

20:17.129 --> 20:18.129
Estás loco. ¿sabes?

20:18.197 --> 20:19.664
Está loco que estás hablando.

20:19.732 --> 20:21.733
'Cause I don't think that
was your plan going in,

20:21.800 --> 20:23.401
but something made you
go down. What was it?

20:23.469 --> 20:25.503
No, no, no.
You're crazy.

20:25.571 --> 20:26.437
Maybe we should
get out of here.

20:26.505 --> 20:27.538
That's a good idea.
Wait. [whistles]

20:27.606 --> 20:28.473
Wait. Look.

20:28.540 --> 20:29.574
I'm the only thing standing

20:29.641 --> 20:31.009
between you and
the feds right now,

20:31.076 --> 20:32.610
let alone immigration.

20:34.513 --> 20:36.047
Scooch up, gorgeous.

20:45.024 --> 20:46.491
All right, fine.

20:48.127 --> 20:50.061
Me and Raul, we were close.

20:50.129 --> 20:51.963
Ok?

20:52.031 --> 20:54.565
We're from the same part
of Peru. ¿sabes?

20:54.633 --> 20:56.334
You always tell me
hate your fighters, right?

20:56.402 --> 20:59.270
Well, I didn't hate Raul.

20:59.338 --> 21:01.339
And look where it got you.

21:01.407 --> 21:03.975
You don't understand.
I needed to help him, all right?

21:04.043 --> 21:06.444
Yeah, something was
makin' him run hot.

21:06.512 --> 21:08.780
I'm not just talkin'
about when he was drunk

21:08.847 --> 21:10.815
and he was braggin'
about beatin' you.

21:10.883 --> 21:12.216
What was it?

21:14.386 --> 21:16.654
He said it was
the shining path,

21:16.722 --> 21:18.656
the senderistas
de Peru, all right?

21:18.724 --> 21:21.259
They knew he was here, and
they were coming for him.

21:22.294 --> 21:23.995
He said it was gonna
be his last fight

21:24.063 --> 21:26.130
before he left town.
That's all I know.

21:27.866 --> 21:31.836
So you decided you were... you
were gonna help him, right?

21:33.238 --> 21:35.740
You take the count.
You gift him the cash.

21:35.808 --> 21:36.974
Is that it?

21:41.413 --> 21:43.047
Good.

21:43.115 --> 21:45.249
Hey. So we're diggin'
into Raul's whereabouts.

21:45.317 --> 21:47.151

close to finding out...

21:55.494 --> 21:57.829
Well, put it back on.

21:58.797 --> 22:00.064
Yeah.

22:02.468 --> 22:04.102
For some reason,
Agent Carl Washington

22:04.169 --> 22:06.137
pulled our DNA sample
off the rush list.

22:06.205 --> 22:08.339
I had to put it back
on the fast track,

22:08.407 --> 22:10.908
but we may have a problem.

22:11.844 --> 22:13.511
I'm gonna look into it.

22:13.579 --> 22:15.980
You guys stay on your toes.

22:16.048 --> 22:17.582
Yes, sir.

22:20.519 --> 22:22.086
Simone: Come on!
You got this!

22:22.154 --> 22:23.554
Give it to him, baby!

22:26.225 --> 22:29.127
Hey, there's something weird
with this FBI footage.

22:29.194 --> 22:30.128
What?

22:30.195 --> 22:32.463
Well, it jumped
like it was edited.

22:32.531 --> 22:33.531
It should be...

22:33.599 --> 22:36.234
21 minutes, 43 seconds.

22:36.301 --> 22:38.369
But onscreen, it's 21
minutes, 36 seconds.

22:38.437 --> 22:39.537
We lost 7 seconds.

22:39.605 --> 22:41.939
It's probably on the hard drive.
I'll find it.

22:43.275 --> 22:45.143
Uh, listen. I forgot.
Lightman called.

22:45.210 --> 22:47.678
He said he wanted you
to, uh, get ready

22:47.746 --> 22:49.847
to present your research
on lowland gorillas.

22:49.915 --> 22:50.848
When?

22:50.916 --> 22:52.550
This afternoon.

22:53.752 --> 22:56.220
But I have at least 2
days more work on that.

22:56.288 --> 22:58.356
Well, better get on it.

22:59.258 --> 23:00.491
Well...

23:00.559 --> 23:01.759
What about this case?

23:01.827 --> 23:02.994
I'll cover it.

23:03.061 --> 23:04.562
Go do your thing.

23:15.007 --> 23:16.140
Have you seen Lightman?

23:16.208 --> 23:18.176
I've got a person of interest
I can't hold too long.

23:18.243 --> 23:19.577
Uh, I think he's at lunch,

23:19.645 --> 23:21.512
but if you... I can start
the questioning,

23:21.580 --> 23:22.914
stall till he comes back.

23:22.981 --> 23:24.782
Ok.

23:43.202 --> 23:46.037
These were taken
from video footage

23:46.104 --> 23:49.240
of the illegal fight
you set up last night,

23:49.308 --> 23:50.975
and it turns out
it was at a warehouse

23:51.043 --> 23:53.344
owned by a relative of yours.

23:53.412 --> 23:57.181
I don't know nothing
about a fight.

24:00.018 --> 24:03.387
Your uncle sold copper out of
that warehouse for 26 years.

24:03.455 --> 24:05.356
What's that got to do with me?

24:05.424 --> 24:06.624
We know about everything.

24:06.692 --> 24:10.294
We put a pin in every location
where you funded a fight.

24:10.362 --> 24:14.665
[Sighs] I never
funded anything.

24:18.036 --> 24:19.870
You know...

24:19.938 --> 24:22.540
You're a dead ringer

24:22.608 --> 24:24.976
for this girl I know.

24:25.043 --> 24:27.311
I guess we all have a twin.

24:28.547 --> 24:29.814
Yeah.

24:29.881 --> 24:34.218
Apparently mine is
a very dangerous man.

24:38.523 --> 24:40.358
Can we have a word?

24:42.594 --> 24:44.996
[Clicks tongue]

24:50.869 --> 24:52.536
What's going on?

24:52.604 --> 24:53.838
Nothing.

24:53.905 --> 24:55.206
Marshall's lying.

24:55.274 --> 24:57.008
No... no, he's not.

24:58.176 --> 24:59.810
Are you afraid of him?

25:00.679 --> 25:01.846
No.

25:03.915 --> 25:06.350
Damn it.

25:06.418 --> 25:07.818
Where's Lightman?

25:09.154 --> 25:11.222
No offense, but with
a chess player

25:11.290 --> 25:13.057
like Marshall, I need a pro.

25:13.125 --> 25:15.326
Well, he's not gonna read
anything different.

25:15.394 --> 25:17.495
If you want me
to try again, I will.

25:19.231 --> 25:20.364
Fine.

25:20.432 --> 25:22.199
Let's go.

25:42.385 --> 25:43.319
Hi.

25:43.386 --> 25:44.954
Hi.

25:46.289 --> 25:47.323
What's wrong?

25:47.390 --> 25:48.257
Nothing.

25:48.325 --> 25:50.025
I was just checkin' in,
you know.

25:50.093 --> 25:53.062
Why don't you just
come right out with it?

25:53.129 --> 25:55.497
I didn't wanna...

25:55.565 --> 25:56.398
Intrude.

25:56.466 --> 25:57.633
Yeah. That's it.
Yeah. No.

25:57.701 --> 25:59.202
Yeah, because that is
not like you at all.

25:59.369 --> 26:00.536
Yes.

26:02.239 --> 26:04.006
I'm seeing someone.

26:04.074 --> 26:05.141
There. You happy now?

26:05.209 --> 26:07.777
So you've got my back,

26:07.845 --> 26:10.179
knowing my... my luck
with men as you do.

26:10.247 --> 26:13.015
Is... is that what you
wanted to check in about?

26:13.083 --> 26:14.083
No.

26:14.151 --> 26:16.118
Huh.

26:16.186 --> 26:18.387
Well, mostly yes.

26:18.455 --> 26:19.388
Great.

26:19.456 --> 26:20.723
All right.
Thank you.

26:20.791 --> 26:23.059
No, really, thank you.
I mean that.

26:23.126 --> 26:26.429
But... but now can...
can you try

26:26.496 --> 26:28.965
a-and do your best

26:29.032 --> 26:31.734
not to stick your nose
I-into my business?

26:31.802 --> 26:34.437
Yeah. I can do that.
Yeah.

26:35.639 --> 26:39.742
Turns out our witness
who saw the prime suspect

26:39.810 --> 26:41.143
has a history of drug abuse,

26:41.211 --> 26:43.079
putting his credibility
in question.

26:43.146 --> 26:44.881
I need you to talk to him.

26:44.948 --> 26:46.515
I'll be right there.

26:49.887 --> 26:52.154
I need you to take this one.

26:52.222 --> 26:54.190
Ok.

27:02.399 --> 27:04.400
Thought I gave 'em
my description.

27:04.468 --> 27:05.601
You did.

27:05.669 --> 27:08.604
After taking a few hits
of meth, it seems.

27:08.672 --> 27:11.941
Were you strung out
last night when you saw Raul?

27:12.009 --> 27:12.942
Nah.

27:13.010 --> 27:13.876
Nah, I swear.

27:13.944 --> 27:16.112
I didn't have any money.

27:19.116 --> 27:20.783
You've had
a couple of run-ins

27:20.851 --> 27:22.985
with the law
for drug possession.

27:24.221 --> 27:25.755
Did you think giving
an eyewitness account

27:25.822 --> 27:28.591
would earn you some goodwill?

27:28.659 --> 27:29.992
No.

27:30.060 --> 27:31.527
Higher voice pitch.
That was a yes.

27:31.595 --> 27:33.863
Did you really see
a guy with Raul,

27:33.931 --> 27:36.399
or was it made up
to earn brownie points?

27:36.466 --> 27:39.802
I'm tellin' you I saw him.

27:39.870 --> 27:42.004
Kinda looked like that guy.

27:45.342 --> 27:48.110
The suspect looked
like this guy?

27:48.178 --> 27:49.645
Yeah.

27:50.814 --> 27:52.281
Lightman: You heard of
the shining path, right?

27:52.349 --> 27:53.616
What, the senderistas?

27:53.684 --> 27:56.052
They're a guerilla group
out of Peru.

27:56.119 --> 27:58.120
Yeah. They make
the vikings look

27:58.188 --> 28:00.890
like little boys looking
for a good wrestle.

28:00.958 --> 28:03.192
Well, Raul was scared of them.

28:03.260 --> 28:05.795
He thought they were
after him for some reason.

28:05.862 --> 28:06.862
Lightman, what are you doin'?

28:06.930 --> 28:08.397
I mean, what does
this kid mean to you?

28:08.465 --> 28:10.066
He was a good boy.

28:10.133 --> 28:12.101
You know, he was a little
misguided, perhaps, but... yeah.

28:12.169 --> 28:13.903
Kind of like you
at one point, huh?

28:13.971 --> 28:15.638
What, you my shrink now,
are you?

28:15.706 --> 28:17.306
Nah, nah.
I'm just sayin'.

28:17.374 --> 28:20.142
I mean, you put your nuts on the
boot end of a criminal enterprise,

28:20.210 --> 28:21.544
and I'm tryin'
to understand why.

28:21.611 --> 28:23.813
I have my reasons.

28:23.880 --> 28:25.314
All right. Well, look,
dollars to doughnuts,

28:25.382 --> 28:27.183
Raul was killed by somebody
in the fight world,

28:27.250 --> 28:28.184
maybe even Marshall.

28:28.251 --> 28:29.518
No. Raul was
the atm, right?

28:29.586 --> 28:31.887
Why'd you pull the trigger
on a good payday?

28:31.955 --> 28:33.656
Well, answer could
be on the tape.

28:33.724 --> 28:36.158
Oh, and by the way,
Dillon put your DNA test

28:36.226 --> 28:37.293
back on rush status.

28:37.361 --> 28:39.829
The results should be
here in a few hours.

28:39.896 --> 28:40.830
Do I look worried?

28:40.897 --> 28:43.432
That's him. That's him.
That's the guy.

28:44.501 --> 28:47.069
That's who was fightin'
with the kid.

28:50.374 --> 28:53.042
I think you've made a
terrible mistake, mate.

28:53.110 --> 28:54.710
I saw you with him.

28:54.778 --> 28:56.412
You saw me?
Yeah.

28:56.480 --> 28:58.147
You absolutely
positive, are you?

28:58.215 --> 28:59.582
Yeah.
Yeah?

28:59.649 --> 29:02.284
You saw this face in the dark

29:02.352 --> 29:03.919
with that astigmatism, did you?

29:03.987 --> 29:06.088
Who are you?

29:06.156 --> 29:07.089
This is
Dr. Cal Lightman.

29:07.157 --> 29:08.090
He runs this place.

29:08.158 --> 29:09.425
Also live in this place.

29:09.493 --> 29:12.528
So you're saying
you were here last night?

29:12.596 --> 29:14.730
Oh, yeah.
I was with him.

29:15.932 --> 29:17.666
Yeah.

29:24.174 --> 29:25.574
Come on. Let's go.

29:25.642 --> 29:27.209
Maybe it wasn't him.

29:30.747 --> 29:32.782
Now, did you really
see an astigmatism?

29:32.849 --> 29:34.050
No.

29:34.117 --> 29:36.585
You're learning, eh?

29:36.653 --> 29:39.288
Ok, so I saw something here.

29:39.356 --> 29:41.724
[Yelling]

29:45.562 --> 29:47.296
Right there.

29:47.364 --> 29:49.098
Raul flashed fear.

29:49.166 --> 29:50.800
Yeah. He's...

29:50.867 --> 29:53.135
Looking at something
to his left, right?

29:53.203 --> 29:55.671
Yeah.
That would be you.

29:55.739 --> 29:57.540
You know,
park your mouth, Torres.

29:57.607 --> 29:59.508
All right?
Put your brain in gear.

29:59.576 --> 30:02.178
All right, let's look
at the other people there,

30:02.245 --> 30:03.712
preferably behind me.

30:10.754 --> 30:12.955
[Yelling]

30:16.560 --> 30:18.027
All right, freeze it there.

30:19.596 --> 30:21.330
Um, push in.

30:21.398 --> 30:22.665
Push in. Push in.

30:22.732 --> 30:24.400
Push, push, push.

30:30.540 --> 30:31.907
Right. Right about now,

30:31.975 --> 30:34.043
all right, th-the fight
is getting really,

30:34.111 --> 30:38.347
really good, and, uh, the crowd
is goin' bonkers, right?

30:38.415 --> 30:40.349
All except for this guy.

30:40.417 --> 30:44.720
Yeah. His... his body language
is completely relaxed.

30:48.325 --> 30:50.359
He's not there for a fight.

30:50.427 --> 30:53.395
So how did your girlfriend
track this down?

30:53.463 --> 30:56.632
She called the charter
company, and, uh... thank you.

30:56.700 --> 30:59.535
And pretended to be
her fiancé's assistant.

30:59.603 --> 31:02.872
Huh. Well, if I had
to put money on it,

31:02.939 --> 31:05.741
the guy charters a boat out
of Baltimore for 5 hours,

31:05.809 --> 31:07.343
he's probably a drug smuggler.

31:12.015 --> 31:15.084
So how long has your
girlfriend known her fiancé?

31:16.453 --> 31:18.187
A few months.

31:18.255 --> 31:20.356
Well, she should be careful.

31:20.423 --> 31:23.292
I don't know
what I'm gonna tell her.

31:23.360 --> 31:25.394
She's in love with him.

31:26.863 --> 31:29.431
All right, look, you know,

31:29.499 --> 31:32.568
if your girlfriend can get that
passport and maybe his cell phone,

31:32.636 --> 31:34.637
we can look into it, you know.

31:41.011 --> 31:42.945
Sir, you wanted to see me?

31:43.013 --> 31:45.548
Yeah.
Give us a minute.

31:45.615 --> 31:47.082
Have a seat.

31:47.150 --> 31:48.317
All right.

31:52.822 --> 31:55.257
What's goin' on?

31:55.325 --> 31:57.893
You impersonated
Agent Washington

31:57.961 --> 32:00.596
to delay the prime
suspect's DNA report.

32:00.664 --> 32:02.631
Who are you covering for?

32:06.703 --> 32:08.437
I've got something
for you. Oh, yeah.

32:08.505 --> 32:09.438
Right there.

32:09.506 --> 32:12.007
This is a picture,

32:12.075 --> 32:14.109
all right, from the fight.

32:21.918 --> 32:23.033
Well, I'm in it.

32:25.510 --> 32:26.777
You were at an illegal fight

32:26.844 --> 32:27.911
just to study faces?
Correct.

32:28.979 --> 32:30.980
For you, no extra charge.

32:31.048 --> 32:32.882
Did you know Raul Campos?

32:32.950 --> 32:35.418
Not personally.

32:35.485 --> 32:37.420
No, but I seen him fight.

32:37.487 --> 32:40.856
Your interest in which
was purely professional.

32:40.924 --> 32:42.525
100%.

32:43.560 --> 32:44.493
90%.

32:44.561 --> 32:46.028
Ok...

32:46.997 --> 32:50.166
80, actually, percent.

32:50.234 --> 32:52.101
Why didn't you
tell me this earlier?

32:52.169 --> 32:55.271
Well, I... I misjudged you...

32:55.339 --> 32:56.672
Bernard. I did.

32:56.740 --> 32:59.442
I... because of the,
you know, history

32:59.509 --> 33:01.210
between you and I, I...

33:01.278 --> 33:03.546
you once wrote a report on me

33:03.614 --> 33:05.548
based on a single
interview session

33:05.616 --> 33:08.150
which affected my
promotion schedule,

33:08.218 --> 33:11.454
knocked me back easily 2 years.

33:11.521 --> 33:13.456
No, I did do that. Yep.

33:13.523 --> 33:16.559
Which is why I thought
you were gonna come in here

33:16.627 --> 33:21.364
and press charges and
strip me of my FBI contract.

33:21.431 --> 33:23.266
And what about you,
Agent Reynolds?

33:23.333 --> 33:25.635
He doesn't give a toss
about politics.

33:25.702 --> 33:28.471
He's... he's all about
getting the job done. He...

33:29.806 --> 33:31.641
"Big picture" Ben,
we call him around here.

33:31.708 --> 33:37.280
Sir, Lightman just needed more time
to canvass his fight contacts.

33:38.782 --> 33:41.884
Right. Um, now...

33:41.952 --> 33:43.119
This...

33:45.455 --> 33:47.556
Is the man you want.

33:47.624 --> 33:48.557
All right?

33:48.625 --> 33:50.893
Now, Reynolds here
already has my people

33:50.961 --> 33:54.230
working on getting,
you know, better resolution

33:54.298 --> 33:55.998
on the license plate, so...

33:56.066 --> 33:58.701
He's all over it.

34:14.751 --> 34:18.554
Ah, you're a sight
for sore eyes.

34:19.489 --> 34:21.023
I thought
you were working late.

34:21.091 --> 34:24.226
Yeah.
The foster parents canceled.

34:24.293 --> 34:26.329
What are you doin' here?

34:26.396 --> 34:29.297
Uh, I was just, um... I was
looking for an earring...

34:29.366 --> 34:30.533
That I lost.

34:31.967 --> 34:35.071
I thought maybe you
were looking for this.

34:38.442 --> 34:40.710
It wasn't where I left it.

34:43.380 --> 34:45.748
Who's Marco Gianelli?

34:48.351 --> 34:50.619
This passport is for work.

34:50.687 --> 34:52.722
That's all I can say.

34:53.556 --> 34:55.391
It's for the youth center?

34:56.460 --> 34:57.793
Yes and no.

34:57.861 --> 35:00.863
Just tell me the truth.

35:07.304 --> 35:09.271
[Sighs]

35:10.741 --> 35:12.375
I have to go.

35:14.611 --> 35:16.445
I work for the DEA.

35:18.548 --> 35:20.249
I'm an undercover Agent.

35:20.317 --> 35:22.518
I've been at Covington
for the last 6 months

35:22.586 --> 35:25.254
monitoring
2 ms-13 gangbangers

35:25.322 --> 35:28.891
that we believe are part of a
new drug cartel in Mexico.

35:31.294 --> 35:32.895
Are you a real psychologist?

35:32.963 --> 35:34.864
Yes.

35:34.931 --> 35:36.899
Look, I've withheld
information,

35:36.967 --> 35:39.668
but nothing that I've
told you is false,

35:39.736 --> 35:42.972
except meeting
of the foster parents.

35:46.209 --> 35:48.411
Your real name, what is it?

35:48.478 --> 35:50.379
Dave Atherton.

35:51.748 --> 35:53.015
I'm just thinking...

35:55.819 --> 35:58.854
About you and I, th-this...

35:58.922 --> 36:01.290
if this was part of your cover.

36:01.358 --> 36:02.291
No.

36:02.359 --> 36:03.859
Absolutely not, Gillian.

36:03.927 --> 36:06.162
The last thing that I expected

36:06.229 --> 36:10.199
on this job was
to fall in love.

36:11.968 --> 36:14.904
And telling you everything
is incredibly stupid...

36:15.839 --> 36:17.640
And dangerous.

36:20.377 --> 36:23.112
But I don't wanna lose you.

36:23.180 --> 36:25.781
[Sighs]

36:25.849 --> 36:28.317
You haven't.

36:42.432 --> 36:45.100
When do I get to meet
my brother's killer?

36:45.168 --> 36:47.503
Reynolds: Real soon.
I'll be right back.

36:50.073 --> 36:51.674
You sure that's him?

36:51.741 --> 36:53.275
Well, it was a rental car
that was in the photo,

36:53.343 --> 36:54.443
and his name is on
the contract, so...

36:54.511 --> 36:55.611
Incoming.

36:55.679 --> 36:57.313
Dr. Lightman.

36:58.748 --> 37:01.350
We just got the prime
suspect's DNA back.

37:01.418 --> 37:04.587
You've got
some explaining to do.

37:07.041 --> 37:09.942
You concealed a personal
relationship with the victim.

37:10.310 --> 37:12.444
Well, I was just trying
to help, you know.

37:12.512 --> 37:15.013
And you thought
I was the dirty one.

37:15.081 --> 37:18.517
No, I wasn't sure that you
were dirty, per se.

37:18.585 --> 37:21.620
You know, I... I just... I couldn't
be 100% sure at the time.

37:21.688 --> 37:26.658
How sure were you?
90%? 80%?

37:26.726 --> 37:28.427
I didn't kill Raul,

37:28.494 --> 37:31.263
you know, if that's
where this is going.

37:31.331 --> 37:32.864
How can I be 100% sure?

37:32.932 --> 37:34.099
Find the real killer?

37:34.167 --> 37:37.202
How do you explain the
fight outside the bar?

37:37.270 --> 37:38.370
He was drunk.

37:38.438 --> 37:39.705
I was gettin' his keys.

37:39.772 --> 37:41.373
Don't take me for a fool.

37:41.441 --> 37:43.075
Do you have any idea
how overwhelming

37:43.142 --> 37:44.242
the evidence is against you?

37:44.310 --> 37:46.545
Look, I'm not
taking you for a tool.

37:46.613 --> 37:48.313
Fool!

37:48.381 --> 37:49.881
Whatever. Whatever.
Look, Bernard...

37:49.949 --> 37:53.652
Just give me 10 minutes
in the cube with Juan.

37:53.720 --> 37:57.456
So you came here to take
your brother back home.

37:57.523 --> 38:00.025
Right? But you
threatened him,

38:00.093 --> 38:01.960
and then he ran away.

38:02.028 --> 38:04.363
Why would I threaten
my own brother?

38:04.430 --> 38:06.932
I don't know. Um...

38:07.000 --> 38:08.400
You're a senderista, right?

38:08.468 --> 38:11.336
You know, you'd threaten your
own grandmother, wouldn't you?

38:11.404 --> 38:12.571
I fight for the revolution.

38:12.639 --> 38:15.007
So did my father,
and so did Raul!

38:15.074 --> 38:16.041
All right, calm down.

38:16.109 --> 38:17.409
Calm down.

38:18.978 --> 38:23.582
But Raul,
he got away, didn't he?

38:23.650 --> 38:24.816
He... he escaped.

38:24.884 --> 38:27.786
Now, I don't know,
but it seems to me

38:27.854 --> 38:29.588
if you join the shining path,

38:29.656 --> 38:31.990
that's a lifetime's membership.

38:32.058 --> 38:35.293
You came here to remind
him of that, didn't you?

38:35.361 --> 38:39.398
Or to, you know... kck kck... kill
him if he didn't see sense.

38:39.465 --> 38:42.267
I never found my brother.

38:44.671 --> 38:46.071
You shot him...

38:46.873 --> 38:47.873
Didn't you?

38:47.940 --> 38:50.409
You shot him in cold blood.

38:50.476 --> 38:52.944
I was still looking
for him this morning.

38:53.012 --> 38:55.681
Dillon:
That's enough, Lightman.

38:55.748 --> 38:57.949
Mr. Campos,
you're free to go.

38:59.318 --> 39:01.720
Oh, what?
Are you nuts?

39:01.788 --> 39:03.622
I just hooked the bastard!

39:14.600 --> 39:17.102
Man: Juan.

39:17.170 --> 39:18.570
¿Qué hay?

39:44.030 --> 39:45.297
After the fight, right.

39:45.364 --> 39:48.433
Raul was happy.
He was excited to go home.

39:57.043 --> 39:59.311
Dillon: Tell him that.

40:27.673 --> 40:30.308
He talked to Raul
yesterday afternoon.

40:30.376 --> 40:31.476
All units, go.

40:31.544 --> 40:33.645
[Sirens blaring]

40:37.250 --> 40:39.084
Juan!

40:39.152 --> 40:41.019
Juan!
Don't you move!

40:41.888 --> 40:43.789
Don't move!
Don't you move!

40:43.856 --> 40:45.457
Get on the ground.
Get on the ground.

40:45.525 --> 40:46.725
Put your hands on the ground.

40:46.793 --> 40:48.160
Get your hands behind you.

40:48.227 --> 40:49.795
Juan!

40:57.470 --> 40:58.703
Get up.

40:58.771 --> 41:00.005
Let's go.

41:14.253 --> 41:15.387
Aye, aye.

41:15.454 --> 41:16.354
Foster: Hey.

41:16.422 --> 41:19.090
Uh, Cal, you remember Dave,
don't you?

41:19.158 --> 41:21.226
Yeah. Uh, from juvie.

41:21.294 --> 41:24.863
Right? Eh, burns.
Dave burns. Yep.

41:24.931 --> 41:27.265
Yeah. Yeah? Right.

41:27.333 --> 41:28.934
Did I get that right? Or did
I make a mistake, 'cause I'm...

41:29.001 --> 41:31.236
no, 'cause I'm
terrible with names.

41:31.304 --> 41:33.605
No, no, no. You got it right.
How are you?

41:33.673 --> 41:35.807
I'm terrible with names.
I'm, you know...

41:37.243 --> 41:40.679
Um, did I say something
there that surprised you?

41:40.746 --> 41:42.948
Or is it... no, no.
I've got it right.

41:43.015 --> 41:47.352
No, 'cause it's been donkey's years
since she's had a bit, you know...

41:47.420 --> 41:49.621
Of anything special in her life, right?
I mean, you know,

41:49.689 --> 41:52.023
not that there's anything wrong with her.
Far from it.

41:52.091 --> 41:55.260
I mean, she's just
a little bit...

41:55.328 --> 41:56.428
Awkward.

41:56.495 --> 41:58.430
Awkward is good. Yeah.

41:58.497 --> 42:00.165
Heh. Ok.

42:00.233 --> 42:02.234
So you've had your fun, Cal.

42:02.301 --> 42:05.570
All right. Just talk amongst
yourself for a minute. Hey.

42:05.638 --> 42:07.839
Dave, do me a favor, all right?

42:07.907 --> 42:09.841
She's my best friend,
all right?

42:09.909 --> 42:11.676
She's my best friend

42:11.744 --> 42:14.980
and is probably the only reason
that this place hasn't gone under,

42:15.047 --> 42:17.916
so you do me a favor,
you know. Just...

42:17.984 --> 42:19.517
Handle with care, you know?

42:19.585 --> 42:22.020
Don't let him
scare you off. Heh.

42:22.088 --> 42:24.022
I thought I told you to...

42:24.090 --> 42:25.357
talk amongst myself.
Right.

42:25.424 --> 42:26.691
Yeah. I got bored.

42:26.759 --> 42:27.726
Really?
Mmm.

42:27.793 --> 42:29.828
Oh.

42:32.064 --> 42:33.999
Will you give us a second?

42:34.066 --> 42:35.433
Sure.

42:35.501 --> 42:36.935
He seems nice.

42:37.003 --> 42:38.169
Cal.

42:38.237 --> 42:39.671
What?

42:39.739 --> 42:40.672
You ok?

42:40.740 --> 42:41.773
What, me? Yeah.

42:41.841 --> 42:44.309
[Scoffs] I'm fantastic.
How 'bout you? You ok?

42:44.377 --> 42:46.211
Illegal underground
fights, Cal?

42:46.279 --> 42:48.113
You could have told me.

42:49.782 --> 42:53.752
You know, just because you share all
your dirty little secrets, all right,

42:53.819 --> 42:55.720
doesn't mean I have to.

42:57.590 --> 42:59.357
He's a good man, Cal.

42:59.425 --> 43:01.660
Yep.
That's all you need to know.

43:01.727 --> 43:03.128
That's all I'm gonna share.

43:03.195 --> 43:04.129
Ok.
Ok.

43:04.196 --> 43:05.397
Yeah. No, I got it.

43:05.464 --> 43:06.698
No. No more questions, right?

43:06.766 --> 43:07.933
[Clicks tongue]

43:09.702 --> 43:11.036
I'm good.
