WEBVTT

00:00.868 --> 00:03.404
Tonight on the curse of Oak
Island.

00:03.437 --> 00:05.039
-We're gonna put the camera in.
-On it.

00:05.073 --> 00:06.440
Let's see what this thing is.

00:06.474 --> 00:08.109
DOUG: We come through
all that undisturbed ground

00:08.142 --> 00:09.610
and then hit something man-made.

00:09.643 --> 00:11.079
RICK:
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

00:11.112 --> 00:12.480
DANNY SMITH:
Damn it.

00:12.513 --> 00:14.182
-Look at that.
-Oh, my goodness.

00:14.215 --> 00:16.584
-That's clearly a keyhole.

00:17.685 --> 00:20.188
Oh, this was how
they smuggled gold.

00:20.221 --> 00:21.555
There was gold under this cross

00:21.589 --> 00:22.790
and the cross
was covered with lead.

00:22.823 --> 00:24.325
So, there's a chance
that they're out

00:24.358 --> 00:25.726
in Smith's Cove still.

00:25.759 --> 00:27.461
You want to rewrite history,
we're rewriting it now.

00:31.399 --> 00:34.402
NARRATOR: There is an island
in the North Atlantic

00:34.435 --> 00:38.139
where people have been looking
for an incredible treasure

00:38.172 --> 00:41.175
for more than 200 years.

00:41.209 --> 00:44.612
So far, they have found
a stone slab

00:44.645 --> 00:47.448
with strange symbols
carved into it...

00:47.481 --> 00:50.384
mysterious fragments
of human bone,

00:50.418 --> 00:52.186
and a lead cross,

00:52.220 --> 00:54.488
whose origin may stretch back

00:54.522 --> 00:56.557
to the days
of the Knights Templar.

00:56.590 --> 00:59.427
To date, six men have died

00:59.460 --> 01:02.330
trying to solve the mystery.

01:02.363 --> 01:05.099
And, according to legend,

01:05.133 --> 01:07.735
one more will have to die

01:07.768 --> 01:10.338
before the treasure
can be found.

01:14.808 --> 01:16.744
*

01:26.720 --> 01:29.157
Okay, Mike,
what's the good word?

01:29.190 --> 01:31.592
I don't know if we have
any good word right yet, but...

01:31.625 --> 01:34.362
Well, that's not what
I'm looking for.

01:34.395 --> 01:37.665
NARRATOR: For Rick Lagina and
members of the Oak Island team,

01:37.698 --> 01:41.135
excavating the massive shaft,
known as D.M.T.,

01:41.169 --> 01:44.805
has proven to be more difficult
and frustrating than expected.

01:47.541 --> 01:49.710
-That took a beating there.
-Yeah.

01:51.845 --> 01:54.448
You can see where it was beating
the  out of it.

01:54.482 --> 01:55.883
That's where that piece is,
right there.

01:55.916 --> 01:58.186
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

01:58.219 --> 02:00.821
-RICK: That really took
a pounding there. -Yeah.

02:02.623 --> 02:04.425
NARRATOR:
One day ago,

02:04.458 --> 02:07.495
after getting the massive,
60-inch-wide drilling caisson

02:07.528 --> 02:10.464
down to a depth
of some 77 feet,

02:10.498 --> 02:12.900
the team from
Irving Equipment Limited

02:12.933 --> 02:16.437
hit what appeared to be a large
and mysterious obstruction.

02:16.470 --> 02:18.539
An obstruction

02:18.572 --> 02:21.309
which not only caused the
powerful rotating oscillator

02:21.342 --> 02:22.743
to malfunction,

02:22.776 --> 02:24.512
but also broke off a number

02:24.545 --> 02:27.448
of the steel caisson's
cutting teeth.

02:27.481 --> 02:28.949
DAVE:
You're , son.

02:28.982 --> 02:31.585
Look at the state of that.
That's been chewed up.

02:31.619 --> 02:33.287
-Oh, no.
-DAVE: 11 out of 36.

02:33.321 --> 02:36.390
We ain't gonna have
no teeth on it.

02:36.424 --> 02:39.693
NARRATOR: In an effort to break
through the mysterious barrier,

02:39.727 --> 02:42.530
the team next used
a four-ton chisel bit,

02:42.563 --> 02:44.598
repeatedly dropping it
into the shaft.

02:46.634 --> 02:48.936
It's strong enough to slow
that thing down on a free fall.

02:48.969 --> 02:51.505
-That's crazy.
-Lots of crazy things happening.

02:51.539 --> 02:53.307
Yeah, I know. I'm learning that.

02:53.341 --> 02:54.742
NARRATOR:
But even with an estimated

02:54.775 --> 02:57.578
62 tons of force
bombarding it,

02:57.611 --> 02:59.813
the obstruction
couldn't be breached.

03:01.582 --> 03:04.385
Yeah, so if it's tearing this
up, that's not good news.

03:04.418 --> 03:06.587
-Nope.
-And you found the teeth.

03:06.620 --> 03:09.523
-Yeah. -So we're just
gonna be gummin' it to death.

03:09.557 --> 03:10.891
But you don't want to move it?

03:10.924 --> 03:13.694
I don't want to move it.

03:13.727 --> 03:15.929
We spent too much time
deliberating

03:15.963 --> 03:17.931
-as to where to put that.
-Yeah.

03:17.965 --> 03:22.503
We think we're on to a target.

03:22.536 --> 03:24.472
Why did it have to be
this hole, though?

03:27.475 --> 03:29.643
Why couldn't it
have been like that

03:29.677 --> 03:32.913
and they just grab onto it
and pull it up?

03:32.946 --> 03:34.948
GARY: Yeah, 'cause nothing
comes easy on Oak Island.

03:34.982 --> 03:36.717
DAVE: Nope. That's for sure,
you know that.

03:36.750 --> 03:39.587
I'm hoping you get through this
and start delivering

03:39.620 --> 03:40.921
some good stuff over there.

03:45.826 --> 03:48.462
NARRATOR: In their effort
to find the exact location

03:48.496 --> 03:50.664
of the original
Oak Island Money Pit,

03:50.698 --> 03:53.401
and with it, the so-called
Chappell Vault,

03:53.434 --> 03:55.669
the seven-foot-tall
wooden structure

03:55.703 --> 03:57.505
first reported
by treasure hunters

03:57.538 --> 04:01.642
William Chappell
and Frerick Blair in 1897,

04:01.675 --> 04:03.377
the Laginas and their partners

04:03.411 --> 04:05.279
have spent months of planning,

04:05.313 --> 04:07.481
and millions
of precious dollars,

04:07.515 --> 04:11.752
in an effort to pinpoint
the most likely drill sights.

04:11.785 --> 04:13.521
Two weeks ago,

04:13.554 --> 04:16.990
while excavating the shaft
known as H-8,

04:17.024 --> 04:19.059
Rick, Marty and the team

04:19.092 --> 04:21.362
were convinced
they had located the vault

04:21.395 --> 04:24.932
at a depth of some 170 feet.

04:24.965 --> 04:27.501
But after attempting
to carefully drill

04:27.535 --> 04:29.603
into what they believed
to be the surface

04:29.637 --> 04:31.939
of the mysterious
wooden structure,

04:31.972 --> 04:35.042
the entire object
appeared to vanish,

04:35.075 --> 04:37.611
as if it had been
pushed out of the way

04:37.645 --> 04:39.880
and sent even further
below ground.

04:41.982 --> 04:44.952
I think, just as important
and expensive as this is,

04:44.985 --> 04:46.654
I would like to see the hole

04:46.687 --> 04:48.556
just, uh, vacuumed out,

04:48.589 --> 04:50.958
and then we can actually
get a visual of a dry hole.

04:50.991 --> 04:53.661
Well, no question about that,
but can you do it?

04:53.694 --> 04:55.062
We use a camera to go down,

04:55.095 --> 04:56.864
if we get the water out,

04:56.897 --> 04:59.667
to see exactly what the casing
is sitting on and where.

04:59.700 --> 05:00.901
A-And then we'll just...

05:00.934 --> 05:02.370
That would,
that'll be a guarantee.

05:02.403 --> 05:03.937
-So, you'd drop that submersible
in there? -Yep.

05:03.971 --> 05:05.973
RICK: I suppose if you
can do that, yeah.

05:06.006 --> 05:07.641
See with our own eyes.

05:07.675 --> 05:09.076
But I think what we're
gonna do for you first.

05:09.109 --> 05:10.544
Obviously, we got
to bring it up,

05:10.578 --> 05:12.045
because we got to get
that section off

05:12.079 --> 05:13.781
and put the ten-foot back on,

05:13.814 --> 05:15.616
so that we can work
at a comfortable height.

05:15.649 --> 05:17.451
There's nothing better
than eyes and boots.

05:17.485 --> 05:19.453
Absolutely.

05:19.487 --> 05:21.088
NARRATOR:
In order to examine the nature

05:21.121 --> 05:24.592
of the obstruction firsthand,
the Oak Island team

05:24.625 --> 05:28.028
will next pump water and sludge
out of the D.M.T. shaft,

05:28.061 --> 05:31.632
so that it can be explored
with a remote camera.

05:31.665 --> 05:34.835
We need to determine the
orientation of the obstruction,

05:34.868 --> 05:38.472
if not determine what it is
and address it somehow.

05:38.506 --> 05:40.474
But I've always believed

05:40.508 --> 05:42.776
that the best way to make
that type of determination

05:42.810 --> 05:44.545
is eyes and boots
on the ground.

05:44.578 --> 05:47.014
We can all-all believe that
it'd be all the sweeter

05:47.047 --> 05:50.551
finding something
after all this hassle.

05:50.584 --> 05:51.952
MIKE JARDINE:
Man, I hope it pays out.

05:54.021 --> 05:56.490
It will.
I can feel it in my bones.

06:01.795 --> 06:03.130
NARRATOR:
Later that day,

06:03.163 --> 06:04.998
as the Irving team prepares

06:05.032 --> 06:07.568
for pumping operations
at the dig site...

06:07.601 --> 06:08.736
Well, look who's here.

06:08.769 --> 06:10.170
Hey!

06:10.203 --> 06:12.105
NARRATOR:
Rick and Marty Lagina,

06:12.139 --> 06:15.409
along with metal detection
expert Gary Drayton,

06:15.443 --> 06:17.878
welcome author
and Knights Templar researcher,

06:17.911 --> 06:19.980
Kathleen McGowan Coppens,
to the island.

06:20.013 --> 06:22.883
-Hi, Rick, so good to see you.
Good to see you.

06:22.916 --> 06:24.985
-Welcome. -Every time I see you,
it's raining, what is this?

06:25.018 --> 06:26.754
Hi. Gary Drayton.

06:26.787 --> 06:28.656
-Very, very nice to meet you,
Gary. -Pleased to meet you.

06:28.689 --> 06:30.558
-Hello.
-Gary's our metal detector guy

06:30.591 --> 06:32.993
-who happened to find the cross,
along with Rick. -Oh, fantastic!

06:33.026 --> 06:34.528
Well, look, I know you have

06:34.562 --> 06:35.896
a bunch of information
for us, correct?

06:35.929 --> 06:37.631
-I do. I'm excited to show it
to you. -All right.

06:37.665 --> 06:40.067
Do you want to go right on into
the war room and get into it?

06:40.100 --> 06:42.069
-Absolutely. Okay.
-Let's do that then.

06:42.102 --> 06:44.104
NARRATOR:
It was three years ago

06:44.137 --> 06:47.140
that Marty and Alex Lagina
first arranged to meet

06:47.174 --> 06:51.011
with Kathleen McGowan Coppens
in MontsÃ©gur, France,

06:51.044 --> 06:53.481
while investigating
possible connections

06:53.514 --> 06:55.583
between the Knights Templar
and the Oak Island mystery.

06:55.616 --> 06:57.518
ALEX:
Well, this is it, huh?

06:57.551 --> 07:00.788
This is... this would've been
the main part of the castle.

07:00.821 --> 07:04.458
It's been rebuilt
since the Cathars were here.

07:04.492 --> 07:06.994
So, what I'm gonna
show you is that

07:07.027 --> 07:11.131
this is where
they took the treasure.

07:11.164 --> 07:13.567
Down the mountain,
on a pulley system,

07:13.601 --> 07:16.537
and landing safely
in Templar hands.

07:16.570 --> 07:18.672
NARRATOR: It was during
this trip to France

07:18.706 --> 07:20.474
that Kathleen
presented the team

07:20.508 --> 07:21.942
with compelling evidence

07:21.975 --> 07:24.077
that members
of the Knights Templar,

07:24.111 --> 07:27.681
facing persecution
under King Philip IV of France,

07:27.715 --> 07:29.216
fled first to Scotland,

07:29.249 --> 07:31.819
and later sailed
to the New World,

07:31.852 --> 07:35.055
taking with them
priceless religious artifacts,

07:35.088 --> 07:39.860
such as the Holy Grail
and the Ark of the Covenant.

07:39.893 --> 07:43.063
It is her belief
that these sacred objects

07:43.096 --> 07:45.599
along with the Templar's
vast accumulations

07:45.633 --> 07:47.167
of gold and jewels,

07:47.200 --> 07:50.871
were buried on Oak Island
for safekeeping.

07:50.904 --> 07:53.741
In the wake of Rick Lagina's
recent discovery

07:53.774 --> 07:56.043
of a lead cross
at Smith's Cove,

07:56.076 --> 07:58.879
a cross that
is nearly identical

07:58.912 --> 08:02.816
to a 14th century Templar
carving in Domme, France,

08:02.850 --> 08:04.852
the team has invited Kathleen

08:04.885 --> 08:07.187
to come and see
the cross in person,

08:07.220 --> 08:09.957
in the hopes that she can
shed more light

08:09.990 --> 08:12.660
on the artifact's true origin.

08:12.693 --> 08:15.596
Oh, so happy to see you all.
It's great to be here.

08:15.629 --> 08:18.532
Kathleen has a wealth
of knowledge about, uh...

08:18.566 --> 08:20.768
Templars and castles

08:20.801 --> 08:22.836
and medieval connections
to things.

08:22.870 --> 08:24.872
We obviously have something

08:24.905 --> 08:27.808
that we consider to be
very important to show you.

08:27.841 --> 08:29.543
I'm dying to see it.

08:29.577 --> 08:31.945
It's time to blow you away.

08:31.979 --> 08:35.215
-Ooh! -Yeah, hoping you feel
the same way I felt

08:35.248 --> 08:37.050
when I first held this
in my hand.

08:39.319 --> 08:42.155
-There you go.
-Oh, my gosh.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.926
Ooh.

08:52.833 --> 08:53.767
Wow.

08:59.673 --> 09:00.608
-We're gonna put the camera in.
-I'm on it.

09:00.641 --> 09:02.309
NARRATOR:
While waiting for operations

09:02.342 --> 09:04.945
at the Money Pit area
to resume...

09:04.978 --> 09:07.114
-GARY: Stunning.
-It's, it is stunning.

09:07.147 --> 09:08.949
NARRATOR: ...author
and Templar researcher,

09:08.982 --> 09:10.851
Kathleen McGowan Coppens,

09:10.884 --> 09:14.187
has come to Oak Island
to make an in-person evaluation

09:14.221 --> 09:16.590
of the mysterious lead cross

09:16.624 --> 09:19.126
that Rick Lagina
and Gary Drayton found buried

09:19.159 --> 09:22.730
at Smith's Cove
just two weeks ago.

09:22.763 --> 09:24.231
You know, obviously,
I saw photos of it

09:24.264 --> 09:26.199
and I was working from a photo,

09:26.233 --> 09:28.802
but, um, holding it is, uh,

09:28.836 --> 09:30.871
a completely different
experience, isn't it?

09:30.904 --> 09:33.206
GARY:
Yeah, it's unbelievable.

09:33.240 --> 09:36.209
There are a lot of
representations of lead crosses

09:36.243 --> 09:38.245
that span a-a large timeframe.

09:38.278 --> 09:40.347
And that can be anywhere
from, you know,

09:40.380 --> 09:43.751
the early third and fourth
century through the, you know,

09:43.784 --> 09:46.954
12th, even into the 13th,
14th century for lead.

09:46.987 --> 09:49.189
So there are a lot
of different kinds of crosses.

09:49.222 --> 09:50.891
Nothing exactly like this,

09:50.924 --> 09:53.326
but there are some
similar versions out there.

09:53.360 --> 09:56.396
And all of them, really old.
From those days.

09:56.429 --> 09:59.633
Well, and I believe
that this is...

09:59.667 --> 10:01.068
-really old, potentially.
-Yeah.

10:02.402 --> 10:05.005
Alex and I, and my nephew Peter,

10:05.038 --> 10:06.306
had been to France.

10:06.339 --> 10:08.008
We had gone to
Rochefoucauld castle

10:08.041 --> 10:11.879
and also Domme, where Templars
were held in a prison there.

10:11.912 --> 10:15.082
And it is...
it is more than similar.

10:15.115 --> 10:18.051
It is an exact representation
of that figurine.

10:18.085 --> 10:19.920
-I believe Alex has some
photographs. -Yeah, I actually,

10:19.953 --> 10:22.289
I have a photo right here, so
I can show you the similarity.

10:22.322 --> 10:25.926
This is, uh, on the left is a
carving in the wall at Domme,

10:25.959 --> 10:28.996
which was the Templar prison,
and on the right, obviously,

10:29.029 --> 10:30.864
is a photo of that artifact.

10:30.898 --> 10:33.166
-But the side-by-side
is amazing. -RICK: Striking.

10:36.704 --> 10:37.905
KATHLEEN:
Dramatic.

10:37.938 --> 10:39.106
Yeah, it is amazing.

10:42.209 --> 10:45.012
As usual, Oak Island gives us
a lot more questions

10:45.045 --> 10:46.313
-than it gives us answers.
-DAVE: Of course.

10:47.848 --> 10:49.717
But I think that we're being led

10:49.750 --> 10:51.885
to some really amazing
questions.

10:51.919 --> 10:56.323
So, what I did when I was sent
pictures of the cross is

10:56.356 --> 10:58.458
I got in touch with
our Templar friends in Europe,

10:58.491 --> 11:00.093
some of whom you know.

11:00.127 --> 11:01.862
-You've met, uh, Tobi Dobler.
-MARTY: Yes.

11:01.895 --> 11:03.430
Tobi, yes.
I remember him well.

11:03.463 --> 11:06.399
The grand master of the
Knights Templar in France.

11:06.433 --> 11:08.869
NARRATOR: While visiting
Rennes-le-ChÃ¢teau

11:08.902 --> 11:11.338
in Southern France
three years ago,

11:11.371 --> 11:13.741
Kathleen arranged for Marty
and his son Alex

11:13.774 --> 11:18.445
to meet with modern day Templar
Grand Master Tobi Dobler.

11:18.478 --> 11:21.882
It was his extensive knowledge
in the ancient order

11:21.915 --> 11:25.318
that gave further credence
to Kathleen's theory--

11:25.352 --> 11:28.889
that a large number of Templars
escaped persecution in Europe

11:28.922 --> 11:31.792
and eventually made their way
to Oak Island,

11:31.825 --> 11:34.461
more than seven centuries ago.

11:34.494 --> 11:37.831
If you were gonna look for the
treasure of the Knights Templar,

11:37.865 --> 11:40.100
right now today, you would look
on Oak Island?

11:47.507 --> 11:50.110
I sent him a picture of this,
and I said, "What do you think?"

11:50.143 --> 11:53.747
And he sent me an explanation

11:53.781 --> 11:56.049
and this very interesting
drawing here.

11:56.083 --> 11:58.451
His first thought was that
perhaps there was gold

11:58.485 --> 12:01.088
under this cross, and that
the cross was covered with lead.

12:04.224 --> 12:06.860
What Tobi showed me was that

12:06.894 --> 12:09.296
the Templars would create
these sort of

12:09.329 --> 12:12.199
what they called pastels,
these sort of rhomboid shapes,

12:12.232 --> 12:15.435
which they would create
out of gold,

12:15.468 --> 12:18.371
and then they would cover it
with lead.

12:18.405 --> 12:20.774
And they would wear them
on cords around their necks,

12:20.808 --> 12:22.509
and that sometimes
they would wear

12:22.542 --> 12:24.344
a central piece in the middle.

12:24.377 --> 12:28.782
So, imagine this as a cross
on a Templar cord

12:28.816 --> 12:31.551
and then surrounded by
these-these pastels,

12:31.584 --> 12:33.253
these rhomboid shapes.

12:33.286 --> 12:34.487
But this was how
they smuggled gold,

12:34.521 --> 12:38.125
and got it out
of the country in a,

12:38.158 --> 12:41.528
in a very safe way without being
detected by guardians.

12:43.463 --> 12:45.999
Tobi was very excited
when he saw this

12:46.033 --> 12:48.401
because the shape of the hole
is the same shape

12:48.435 --> 12:51.471
that was used in the rhomboids
that were found.

12:51.504 --> 12:54.307
And so that was one of the first
things that he, he looked at.

12:56.844 --> 12:58.979
So I just thought
it was very interesting

12:59.012 --> 13:01.281
that his first thought was that
this might have been

13:01.314 --> 13:05.819
part of a Templar necklace that
was used to move gold.

13:07.354 --> 13:09.389
So there's a chance that there's

13:09.422 --> 13:10.958
some of those gold rhomboids

13:10.991 --> 13:12.225
that are out
in Smith's Cove still?

13:12.259 --> 13:14.327
I certainly think so.

13:14.361 --> 13:16.429
Are they gonna be lead,
or are they gonna be gold?

13:16.463 --> 13:19.499
-They're gonna be lead
over gold, we hope. -All right.

13:19.532 --> 13:21.434
Now you're cooking, Gary.

13:21.468 --> 13:23.136
-It is heavy for its size.
-It is heavy.

13:23.170 --> 13:25.205
-It really is.
-I think it's time for us

13:25.238 --> 13:26.539
to go back out there, Gary.

13:26.573 --> 13:29.342
-I hope so.

13:29.376 --> 13:31.144
As far as Oak Island
is concerned,

13:31.178 --> 13:33.113
I've always tried to keep
a very open mind,

13:33.146 --> 13:35.615
and Kathleen has provided us
with some information

13:35.648 --> 13:37.450
that appears to be
highly relevant.

13:37.484 --> 13:42.155
She's a wealth of knowledge
about Medieval everything,

13:42.189 --> 13:44.958
and in particular, she's been
fascinated with the Templars.

13:44.992 --> 13:47.060
She has read a lot,
she's researched a lot.

13:47.094 --> 13:50.163
And there's a possibility
that it's gold inside

13:50.197 --> 13:52.900
this little lead cross.

13:52.933 --> 13:54.534
At this point,
we have to take her word for it.

13:54.567 --> 13:57.404
And she is, as Marty said,
eminently qualified

13:57.437 --> 13:59.239
to speak on such subjects.

13:59.272 --> 14:04.077
Now, you were just in Domme,

14:04.111 --> 14:07.114
but are you aware that
the neighboring town

14:07.147 --> 14:10.083
is called Sarlat

14:12.552 --> 14:14.922
-I did not know that when we
were there. -No, we did not.

14:14.955 --> 14:16.489
We are sitting, right now,
in Nova Scotia,

14:16.523 --> 14:17.991
a place known as New Scotland.

14:18.025 --> 14:20.260
Are we also sitting in a place

14:20.293 --> 14:23.430
that is essentially New Canada?

14:23.463 --> 14:27.067
This idea that there is
essentially a Canada

14:27.100 --> 14:29.402
right next to Domme, which is
where the Templars were,

14:29.436 --> 14:32.105
I think is something worth
looking at.

14:34.307 --> 14:38.478
What if we're looking at
a potentially different idea

14:38.511 --> 14:41.581
for how Canada becomes Canada?

14:43.716 --> 14:46.453
NARRATOR: It has been widely
accepted that Canada

14:46.486 --> 14:49.957
first got its name from the
16th century French explorer

14:49.990 --> 14:54.327
Jacques Cartier, who reportedly
began referring to the area

14:54.361 --> 14:56.930
using the Iroquois word
"kanata,"

14:56.964 --> 14:59.632
meaning "village"
or "settlement."

14:59.666 --> 15:04.171
By the 1700s, fueled by
the spread of the fur trade,

15:04.204 --> 15:07.507
the area known as "Canada"
had grown to refer to all

15:07.540 --> 15:10.710
French-controlled lands
in North America.

15:10.743 --> 15:14.314
But could the name actually
have a much different origin,

15:14.347 --> 15:17.284
as Kathleen McGowan suggests--

15:17.317 --> 15:19.452
one first given to the region

15:19.486 --> 15:21.054
by members
of the Knights Templar?

15:23.323 --> 15:26.126
I did not realize that we were
so close to "Canada"

15:26.159 --> 15:27.360
when we were in Domme.

15:27.394 --> 15:28.962
-Yes.

15:28.996 --> 15:30.697
-ALEX: I'm willing to buy that.
-Sure.

15:30.730 --> 15:33.533
The alternate origin story
for Canada's name.

15:33.566 --> 15:35.602
You know, the connection
with the French is strong enough

15:35.635 --> 15:37.570
that I don't have any
trouble with that.

15:37.604 --> 15:39.339
So, if we're looking
at a different timeline,

15:39.372 --> 15:42.542
and we're saying that the region
was discovered

15:42.575 --> 15:44.978
much earlier than that--
say 300 years earlier--

15:45.012 --> 15:46.479
then I think we have to
start looking at

15:46.513 --> 15:48.982
possibly different
origin stories

15:49.016 --> 15:51.484
for some of the etymology.

15:51.518 --> 15:53.020
Rick, you want to
rewrite history,

15:53.053 --> 15:56.156
-well, we're rewriting it now.
-Exactly.

15:56.189 --> 15:58.391
MARTY:
It's an interesting fact

15:58.425 --> 16:00.427
that this word "Canada"
appears there.

16:00.460 --> 16:03.463
It's one of the strange things
about Oak Island

16:03.496 --> 16:07.434
that somehow you can make these
quasi-coherent,

16:07.467 --> 16:10.703
quasi-logical connections
to so many things

16:10.737 --> 16:12.705
that it just boggles the mind.

16:12.739 --> 16:17.177
So those are my
initial thoughts.

16:17.210 --> 16:19.779
Obviously, there's a lot more
research to be done,

16:19.812 --> 16:23.683
and-and more digging to do,
literally and figuratively,

16:23.716 --> 16:25.552
but I think it's so exciting.

16:25.585 --> 16:28.455
I think this is an amazing
artifact, and I think

16:28.488 --> 16:31.624
it's a potential missing link
to a huge part

16:31.658 --> 16:33.426
of what this island is,
and what it means.

16:33.460 --> 16:34.427
Let's see where it leads us,
right?

16:34.461 --> 16:36.529
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

16:36.563 --> 16:40.333
NARRATOR: Although determining
the exact origin and age

16:40.367 --> 16:44.404
of the cross will still require
weeks of further testing,

16:44.437 --> 16:47.307
Kathleen's research has
provided Rick, Marty,

16:47.340 --> 16:49.576
and the team
with information that helps

16:49.609 --> 16:51.578
to validate their gut instinct

16:51.611 --> 16:55.682
that it is both very old
and of Templar origin.

16:55.715 --> 16:59.552
Her visit also assures them
that they may be close

16:59.586 --> 17:02.255
to a breakthrough--
one that supports

17:02.289 --> 17:05.658
all the reasons they came to
Oak Island in the first place.

17:05.692 --> 17:07.694
When I was a little boy,
I believed

17:07.727 --> 17:10.363
that there was
a wonderful story here.

17:10.397 --> 17:13.400
Far and away exceeds the value
of any temporal treasure,

17:13.433 --> 17:15.435
and I think ththtreasure
is the story.

17:15.468 --> 17:17.804
But I believed it then,
and I believe it now.

17:17.837 --> 17:19.306
MARTY:
Well, listen,

17:19.339 --> 17:21.274
I am positive I speak
for everybody

17:21.308 --> 17:24.077
when I thank you profusely
for coming here,

17:24.111 --> 17:26.413
sharing all this research
you've done.

17:26.446 --> 17:28.181
But here's the part I think...

17:28.215 --> 17:30.283
well, no, I know
you're gonna want to hear.

17:30.317 --> 17:32.485
Now is the good part.
Let's go back,

17:32.519 --> 17:34.387
let's have a look
at all these things.

17:34.421 --> 17:36.656
I am certain you're eager
to do so.

17:36.689 --> 17:40.627
Uh, Rick and Gary and I will
show you around the island,

17:40.660 --> 17:43.130
and, uh, I would love to know
your feelings about it

17:43.163 --> 17:45.732
-as we do so.
-Music to my ears. Let's go.

17:45.765 --> 17:47.734
-Let's do it.
-Let's do it.

17:52.405 --> 17:54.841
NARRATOR: Before Kathleen
departs the island,

17:54.874 --> 17:58.611
Rick, Marty and Gary
take her to Smith's Cove

17:58.645 --> 18:01.448
to visit the site
of their potentially

18:01.481 --> 18:03.683
history-changing discovery.

18:03.716 --> 18:06.386
The hole should be
there somewhere.

18:06.419 --> 18:08.721
RICK:
Careful. Be very careful.

18:08.755 --> 18:11.358
Where was we?
It's probably changed a bit now.

18:11.391 --> 18:12.725
I think it was somewhere
around here,

18:12.759 --> 18:14.661
Yeah.
-Somewhere in here, yeah.

18:14.694 --> 18:16.396
Didn't you do significant
digging in this region

18:16.429 --> 18:17.497
the last year?

18:17.530 --> 18:18.765
We did a bunch, Kathleen.

18:18.798 --> 18:20.200
We dug all over here,

18:20.233 --> 18:21.634
and it's entirely possible

18:21.668 --> 18:23.903
that we unearthed that cross.

18:23.936 --> 18:25.572
We would never have seen it.

18:25.605 --> 18:27.174
We weren't metal detecting then.

18:27.207 --> 18:28.541
That's not what we
were looking for.

18:28.575 --> 18:30.510
-Right.
-Well, all this entire area,

18:30.543 --> 18:32.679
I'm gonna go over again.

18:32.712 --> 18:34.714
So, how challenging is this?

18:34.747 --> 18:36.416
What kind of plan
do you have to create

18:36.449 --> 18:38.751
to really exhaust this area?

18:38.785 --> 18:40.787
MARTY:
Well, superficially, it's easy.

18:40.820 --> 18:43.823
But the problem is if we put
any kind of machinery in here,

18:43.856 --> 18:46.393
which it may come to if we want
to move this stuff around,

18:46.426 --> 18:49.429
we got some pretty significant

18:49.462 --> 18:51.398
permitting issues
to jump through.

18:51.431 --> 18:55.502
The problem comes down to
permitting, as Marty just said,

18:55.535 --> 18:58.271
and David's issue with that
little pond that's out there--

18:58.305 --> 19:00.173
the Atlantic Ocean.

19:00.207 --> 19:02.242
Oh, that pond.

19:02.275 --> 19:04.544
Yeah. There's no doubt
in my mind

19:04.577 --> 19:05.912
that there's more here.

19:05.945 --> 19:08.715
That-that cross is so important,

19:08.748 --> 19:10.950
but it's also-- I think it's
the beginning, not the end.

19:10.983 --> 19:13.186
Good.

19:13.220 --> 19:16.256
We're gathering little bits of
information, collating them,

19:16.289 --> 19:19.826
assimilating them,
putting the Templar clues here,

19:19.859 --> 19:23.196
putting the Rosicrucian
or Freemasonry clues here.

19:23.230 --> 19:25.965
Putting this-- these piece,
puzzle pieces here.

19:25.998 --> 19:29.602
And with people's help,
like Kathleen,

19:29.636 --> 19:34.241
I think we're all compiling
the proper puzzle pieces.

19:34.274 --> 19:38.711
I think together,
we will finally get there.

19:38.745 --> 19:40.613
It's amazing.
There's more-- I--

19:40.647 --> 19:41.914
there's more stuff here,
gentlemen.

19:41.948 --> 19:43.583
I know it, I feel it.

19:43.616 --> 19:45.252
Keep digging, guys.

19:45.285 --> 19:47.554
-I like the way you think.

19:56.329 --> 19:59.666
-Scrappy piece of metal.

19:59.699 --> 20:02.902
Jack Begley and island
historian Charles Barkhouse

20:02.935 --> 20:05.738
oversee the team's
pumping operation

20:05.772 --> 20:09.409
to clear an estimated
7,300 gallons of water

20:09.442 --> 20:11.444
out of the D.M.T. shaft.

20:11.478 --> 20:13.680
We're gonna put the pump in
and try to...

20:13.713 --> 20:16.416
-Yeah.

20:16.449 --> 20:19.819
NARRATOR: If successful,
the team is hoping to expose--

20:19.852 --> 20:23.523
and hopefully identify--
the object that has so far

20:23.556 --> 20:27.327
blocked their efforts
to drill beyond some 77 feet.

20:27.360 --> 20:30.229
Heads up.

20:35.368 --> 20:36.769
MIKE J.:
You got it.

20:36.803 --> 20:38.237
-SCOTT: We're on the bottom now.
-DANNY: Sweet!

20:41.941 --> 20:44.010
MIKE J.:
We're ready to rock!

20:44.043 --> 20:45.845
NARRATOR: While the pump begins
to empty the water

20:45.878 --> 20:47.914
out of D.M.T.,

20:47.947 --> 20:50.350
Rick and Marty Lagina,

20:50.383 --> 20:53.486
along with metal detection
expert Gary Drayton,

20:53.520 --> 20:57.457
arrive at Lot 8
near the middle of the island.

20:57.490 --> 20:59.659
Hey, Gary. The sun has come out,
we got a little bit of time,

20:59.692 --> 21:00.993
let's find something.

21:01.027 --> 21:03.296
-That's a good sign.
-I think so.

21:03.330 --> 21:05.365
-MARTY: You got
your lucky digger. -Yep.

21:05.398 --> 21:08.568
NARRATOR: Today, they are
continuing their search

21:08.601 --> 21:11.904
of the areas surrounding
property owned by Tom Nolan,

21:11.938 --> 21:16.309
son of the late Oak Island
treasure hunter Fred Nolan.

21:16.343 --> 21:19.546
These are basically 50 years
of his work,

21:19.579 --> 21:21.781
you know, his survey work
down on the island.

21:21.814 --> 21:24.984
NARRATOR: It was just two weeks
ago that Tom agreed to work

21:25.017 --> 21:27.487
in concert
with the Oak Island team,

21:27.520 --> 21:29.656
granting them
unprecedented access

21:29.689 --> 21:32.392
to both his father's
detailed maps,

21:32.425 --> 21:35.362
as well as the Nolan property
where Fred made

21:35.395 --> 21:38.365
some of his most
intriguing discoveries.

21:38.398 --> 21:40.567
There's just something
I wanted to show you.

21:40.600 --> 21:44.003
It's a key.

21:44.036 --> 21:46.839
I've never seen anything
like that before.

21:46.873 --> 21:50.743
We have no understanding
of the skeleton key.

21:50.777 --> 21:52.645
I don't know what it means.

21:52.679 --> 21:54.881
I never got to speak
with Fred about it.

21:54.914 --> 21:58.418
But Fred has gone on record
as saying that he has found--

21:58.451 --> 21:59.819
at least, it's his belief--

21:59.852 --> 22:01.888
that he found 11 places
on the island

22:01.921 --> 22:05.525
where he thought that subsurface
treasure had been recovered.

22:05.558 --> 22:07.494
What else might be out there?

22:07.527 --> 22:10.630
NARRATOR: It was Fred Nolan's
belief that the key

22:10.663 --> 22:13.500
to solving the Oak Island
mystery could be found

22:13.533 --> 22:16.836
by examining clues located
on the surface of the island,

22:16.869 --> 22:20.607
as opposed to dozens
of feet below ground.

22:20.640 --> 22:22.842
In his efforts
to survey and map

22:22.875 --> 22:25.578
all 140 acres of the island,

22:25.612 --> 22:28.715
he marked several areas
where he believed

22:28.748 --> 22:31.083
near-surface treasures
were once deposited,

22:31.117 --> 22:33.553
and later retrieved.

22:33.586 --> 22:37.890
After carefully studying one
of Fred's elaborate maps,

22:37.924 --> 22:39.959
Rick has identified Lot 8

22:39.992 --> 22:45.498
as an area that may yield
significant finds.

22:45.532 --> 22:46.733
MARTY: What a pretty day
this turned into.

22:46.766 --> 22:48.535
GARY:
Yeah, it is.

22:48.568 --> 22:50.770
MARTY: Any time we can
go along with Gary,

22:50.803 --> 22:52.539
it's fun, you know, that's like,
it's a mini treasure hunt

22:52.572 --> 22:54.407
in the big treasure hunt,

22:54.441 --> 22:55.975
and every chance we get,
we're gonna do it.

22:56.008 --> 22:59.045
Any day you go metal detecting
is a good day.

22:59.078 --> 23:01.614
MARTY: I've never used
any metal detector.

23:01.648 --> 23:04.183
Except that green one I have
to find nails in trees.

23:04.216 --> 23:08.187
Yeah, this 17-inch coil
makes a difference.

23:08.220 --> 23:11.591
You get better depth,
and coverage as well.

23:13.460 --> 23:15.495
Eh...

23:15.528 --> 23:17.730
That's a scrappy iron signal.

23:17.764 --> 23:19.732
I'm using a little bit
of discrimination.

23:19.766 --> 23:21.834
We'll just go
for the good targets.

23:24.504 --> 23:27.540
Well, this is a good sign,
we're getting into some iron.

23:27.574 --> 23:30.943
'Cause often,
you've got to find the trash

23:30.977 --> 23:33.613
before you can find
the treasure.

23:33.646 --> 23:35.815
-That should be up on the wall.

23:35.848 --> 23:37.517
That doesn't sound too bad,
does it?

23:48.127 --> 23:50.062
Oh, I'll try pinpointing it.

23:53.265 --> 23:54.867
I'm getting it, now.

23:54.901 --> 23:56.669
Oh.

23:56.703 --> 23:58.037
Scrappy piece of metal.

24:00.740 --> 24:03.042
:
Oh, no, it isn't.

24:03.075 --> 24:04.911
Look at that.

24:04.944 --> 24:06.245
-It's a little ornate...
-Oh, my goodness.

24:06.278 --> 24:08.114
...lock plate?

24:08.147 --> 24:10.883
-That's clearly a keyhole.

24:10.917 --> 24:12.885
I mean, we're looking
for treasure chests.

24:12.919 --> 24:16.689
That, clearly,
was an embossed keyhole.

24:16.723 --> 24:17.957
Very ornate, isn't it?

24:17.990 --> 24:20.059
-Yeah, beautiful.
-And... oh, yeah,

24:20.092 --> 24:22.595
this is like a little flower.
See that?

24:22.629 --> 24:23.896
-That's a flower.
-GARY: Yeah, I see the flower

24:23.930 --> 24:26.032
on the left-hand side.

24:26.065 --> 24:28.000
-Right there.

24:28.034 --> 24:29.168
RICK:
Oh, yeah.

24:29.201 --> 24:31.003
GARY:
It looks like a rose.

24:31.037 --> 24:32.939
MARTY:
Huh.

24:32.972 --> 24:34.774
It's just right here
in the middle of nowhere?

24:36.809 --> 24:39.011
-I mean, really. What's it doing
here? -I don't know.

24:39.045 --> 24:41.013
It's not something
a farmer would've dropped

24:41.047 --> 24:44.016
or a trader or a fur trader,
or anything.

24:44.050 --> 24:46.218
I mean, it looks
like it's part of a chest.

24:46.252 --> 24:48.555
NARRATOR:
A chest?

24:48.588 --> 24:50.623
Could this lock plate

24:50.657 --> 24:53.025
have come from one
of the three missing chests

24:53.059 --> 24:55.895
that once belonged
to Captain James Anderson

24:55.928 --> 24:59.165
and rumored to have been buried
on Oak Island?

24:59.198 --> 25:02.602
And if so,
could it also be connected

25:02.635 --> 25:06.038
to the mysterious skeleton key
found by Fred Nolan

25:06.072 --> 25:10.242
and given to Rick Lagina
just two weeks ago?

25:10.276 --> 25:12.745
MARTY:
Honestly, I was quite excited

25:12.779 --> 25:14.647
about the key cover
that Gary found,

25:14.681 --> 25:19.952
because if I can equate them
to mundane things like farmers

25:19.986 --> 25:23.022
and tradesmen
and things like that,

25:23.055 --> 25:25.057
you know,
the utilitarian stuff,

25:25.091 --> 25:26.993
then, it doesn't
really mean much,

25:27.026 --> 25:29.195
but it's hard
to picture a farmer

25:29.228 --> 25:33.633
having an ornate
key lock cover.

25:33.666 --> 25:37.169
So, you know, you immediately
jump to "this was on a chest."

25:37.203 --> 25:39.772
It's somewhat asymmetrical.

25:39.806 --> 25:41.874
This does not match that at all.

25:41.908 --> 25:44.276
The significance, I think,
of being asymmetric

25:44.310 --> 25:47.013
is that I think
this is handmade.

25:47.046 --> 25:49.949
-Oh, I see. -Yeah, I mean
somebody hammered this out.

25:49.982 --> 25:51.818
-RICK: Right.
-MARTY: It's very cool.

25:51.851 --> 25:56.155
I know that Fred had said
to many people over the years

25:56.188 --> 25:59.158
that he had found up to 11 sites
where he thought

25:59.191 --> 26:01.093
that subsurface treasure
had been recovered.

26:01.127 --> 26:02.962
Something had been dug
from underground.

26:02.995 --> 26:06.165
He always claimed that he had
an actual piece of a chest,

26:06.198 --> 26:08.701
-reinforced with iron rods.
-I remember hearing that, yeah.

26:08.735 --> 26:10.102
Let's keep this in mind;

26:10.136 --> 26:11.871
you need to search
this area real well.

26:11.904 --> 26:13.606
We need to find out
what was in there.

26:13.640 --> 26:14.874
-Yeah.
-Yeah. Okay, great.

26:14.907 --> 26:16.375
All right, mate,
top pocket find.

26:16.408 --> 26:19.746
MARTY:
Top pocket find. Good job.

26:19.779 --> 26:20.947
GARY: All right, let's see
if there's anything else

26:20.980 --> 26:22.014
in the area.

26:28.821 --> 26:32.224
TONY P.:
Just let her down a bit more.

26:32.258 --> 26:35.361
today brings high hopes
that they will finally be able

26:35.394 --> 26:37.630
to find out just what it is

26:37.664 --> 26:41.200
that has been blocking their
progress in the D.M.T. shaft.

26:41.233 --> 26:42.869
RICK:
How deep are you?

26:42.902 --> 26:45.004
DANNY:
So 74 feet.

26:45.037 --> 26:46.238
RICK:
And you've got to get to...?

26:46.272 --> 26:48.340
DANNY:
77 feet.

26:48.374 --> 26:51.911
NARRATOR: The Irving drill crew
has spent the past two days

26:51.944 --> 26:55.314
disassembling the steel
caissons and draining water

26:55.347 --> 26:57.383
out of the 77-foot shaft

26:57.416 --> 27:01.153
in order to lower a camera down
and identify the barrier.

27:03.289 --> 27:05.658
Danny, this is Marty's son,
Alex.

27:05.692 --> 27:06.926
-Hey.

27:06.959 --> 27:08.327
Good. Good to meet you.

27:08.360 --> 27:11.163
Good to meet you.

27:11.197 --> 27:12.999
We've got about four more feet
of water in there

27:13.032 --> 27:16.335
we're gonna try to get out.

27:16.368 --> 27:17.937
ALEX:
I mean, this is great.

27:17.970 --> 27:20.072
We'll know
what we're looking at.

27:20.106 --> 27:22.074
RICK: Once we've... figure out
what this obstruction--

27:22.108 --> 27:23.876
and its orientation,

27:23.910 --> 27:26.713
if we feel like we can
get past the obstruction,

27:26.746 --> 27:29.081
whether or not
we go down there, and...

27:29.115 --> 27:31.350
maybe somebody goes down and
puts the proper sling on it,

27:31.383 --> 27:33.285
we might be able to pull it.

27:33.319 --> 27:36.155
Watch yourself.

27:41.093 --> 27:43.262
If we can latch onto it,
if we can see it,

27:43.295 --> 27:45.732
even if we can
just determine orientation.

27:45.765 --> 27:47.800
-Uh-huh. -I think there's
something down here,

27:47.834 --> 27:51.804
but "X" marks the spot right
there, that's where we are.

27:51.838 --> 27:53.773
RICK: I don't want to move,
because I believe

27:53.806 --> 27:56.208
that we're in the area
of investigation,

27:56.242 --> 27:58.177
i.e. where is the vault?

27:59.846 --> 28:00.880
Hey, Danny.

28:00.913 --> 28:02.448
We're showing 87.3

28:02.481 --> 28:04.183
-in the center.
-Great.

28:04.216 --> 28:05.852
We'll dip out as much
of the dirt as we can,

28:05.885 --> 28:07.119
take more water out.

28:07.153 --> 28:09.989
The obstruction
is right at the water level.

28:10.022 --> 28:12.258
Definitely have
a visual really quick here,

28:12.291 --> 28:15.027
'cause right at the water
surface is where it is.

28:15.061 --> 28:17.129
So it's almost like
we can almost see it.

28:17.163 --> 28:19.031
I know for a fact
we'll be able to see that

28:19.065 --> 28:21.801
from up here, and if you wanted
to put the camera down.

28:21.834 --> 28:23.435
-I think we should put
the camera down. -'Cause it's,

28:23.469 --> 28:25.204
'cause it's gonna be...
yeah, there'd be no water.

28:25.237 --> 28:27.073
-That'd be really,
really interesting. -Yep.

28:30.409 --> 28:33.212
NARRATOR: Assisting the team
are remote camera specialists

28:33.245 --> 28:35.948
Tony and Nick Peverill.

28:35.982 --> 28:40.086
They will be using the Spectrum
120 high-definition camera,

28:40.119 --> 28:44.256
which offers a 360-degree view
of underwater environments

28:44.290 --> 28:47.059
to depths
of up to 1,000 feet.

28:49.061 --> 28:50.797
DANNY:
Any more water we take out,

28:50.830 --> 28:52.064
that's gonna be
really, really helpful.

28:52.098 --> 28:54.300
Now we have a plan.
Let's do this.

28:54.333 --> 28:57.469
De-water, camera
and then make some decisions.

28:57.503 --> 29:00.506
-Very good, very good.

29:00.539 --> 29:02.775
NARRATOR: Because the water
in the bottom of the shaft

29:02.809 --> 29:05.111
is full of silt and sediment,

29:05.144 --> 29:08.380
it must be cleared out before
the camera can be inserted.

29:10.182 --> 29:12.518
RICK:
Is that a hard bottom?

29:12.551 --> 29:14.186
That's something hard.

29:14.220 --> 29:16.222
We don't know
if it's steel or rock.

29:16.255 --> 29:18.825
RICK: It looks as dry
as it's gonna get.

29:18.858 --> 29:20.426
MIKE J.: I think we should
go in with a camera right now.

29:20.459 --> 29:22.328
Oh, you want to take
a look

29:22.361 --> 29:23.963
I think so.
I think so right now.

29:23.996 --> 29:25.564
Okay, well,
let's get it rigged up.

29:25.597 --> 29:28.134
Dan, we're gonna
put the camera in.

29:28.167 --> 29:30.136
All right. I'm on it.

29:37.443 --> 29:39.078
I'm hoping for wood.

29:39.111 --> 29:41.080
-We've encountered zero wood.
-Yeah.

29:41.113 --> 29:44.450
-So it sounds like we're where
a shaft's never been. -Yes.

29:44.483 --> 29:47.086
We want to find out
what this obstruction is.

29:47.119 --> 29:48.487
Is it wood

29:48.520 --> 29:50.256
Is it something else?

29:50.289 --> 29:53.192
If it's not searcher,
it's original.

29:53.225 --> 29:55.027
It would have meant that there
was a human presence

29:55.061 --> 29:56.595
at those depths.

29:56.628 --> 29:59.198
And today, we will come
to a greater understanding

29:59.231 --> 30:01.433
of what the obstruction is.

30:01.467 --> 30:03.569
Well, I'm hoping that,
at this point,

30:03.602 --> 30:04.937
we're not looking for clues.

30:04.971 --> 30:06.038
We're looking for the one thing.

30:06.072 --> 30:07.573
Yes, yes.

30:07.606 --> 30:09.241
If we encounter wood,
it has to be a tunnel.

30:09.275 --> 30:12.178
Oh, yeah, right, right.

30:12.211 --> 30:15.581
NARRATOR: Could the obstruction
be the top of a hidden chamber,

30:15.614 --> 30:18.250
or the cover
to some kind of tunnel?

30:18.284 --> 30:22.454
Perhaps one built to access
the original Money Pit?

30:22.488 --> 30:23.990
Going down?

30:24.023 --> 30:25.824
Go down.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.903
Of all the holes that we did
other than H-8,

30:36.936 --> 30:39.505
which showed us things,

30:39.538 --> 30:41.140
this is the most
promising location.

30:41.173 --> 30:43.342
Yeah.

30:43.375 --> 30:45.912
Danny, put it down a bit more?

30:45.945 --> 30:48.014
Yep.

30:51.417 --> 30:53.385
There?

30:53.419 --> 30:55.587
Try to see what this thing is.

30:58.024 --> 31:01.427
CHARLES:
There's not much water there.

31:01.460 --> 31:03.295
DOUG: Does that look
like a clump of mud,

31:03.329 --> 31:04.863
or does it look
like an end of a timber?

31:06.966 --> 31:08.567
-Yeah.

31:10.536 --> 31:12.071
ALEX:
It's just a rock.

31:12.104 --> 31:13.305
JACK:
I think that's a rock, yeah.

31:15.541 --> 31:17.376
Amazing how that clay keeps

31:17.409 --> 31:21.113
-all the water out, huh,
isn't it? -Mm-hmm.

31:21.147 --> 31:22.915
What is this thing?

31:22.949 --> 31:25.251
We have clay bottom.

31:25.284 --> 31:27.486
We have rock.

31:27.519 --> 31:30.056
But I saw nothing down there
that would give us

31:30.089 --> 31:33.092
some understanding
of what this obstruction is.

31:33.125 --> 31:35.594
I don't know how you guys think,
but I think we've seen enough,

31:35.627 --> 31:37.329
or at least what
we're gonna see.

31:37.363 --> 31:40.266
I think we need to go down there
and check it out.

31:40.299 --> 31:43.135
NARRATOR: Although the team is
getting a high-definition view

31:43.169 --> 31:45.004
of the D.M.T. shaft,

31:45.037 --> 31:47.206
the large amount
of mud and clay

31:47.239 --> 31:49.075
still lying
at the bottom of the hole

31:49.108 --> 31:51.410
has made visibility difficult.

31:51.443 --> 31:54.180
And, to make matters worse,

31:54.213 --> 31:57.483
the shaft is starting
to take in water.

31:57.516 --> 31:59.618
ALEX: See there's water
coming in right there?

31:59.651 --> 32:02.488
-RICK: Oh, yeah. -ALEX: I see
the bottom of the casing.

32:02.521 --> 32:04.023
JACK: Are those the holes
for the teeth

32:04.056 --> 32:05.357
right around the sides?

32:05.391 --> 32:06.558
RICK:
There aren't any teeth.

32:06.592 --> 32:08.995
JACK:
Yeah, we're gumming it.

32:09.028 --> 32:10.396
ALEX:
I see nothing.

32:15.034 --> 32:18.037
RICK:
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

32:18.070 --> 32:19.371
Pull up the camera.

32:19.405 --> 32:21.440
-Pull her up.

32:21.473 --> 32:23.609
CHARLES:
Wow, look at that.

32:23.642 --> 32:25.111
-That ain't good.
-No.

32:34.186 --> 32:35.187
What?
If that is indeed
a Whoa, whoa, whoa.l,

32:35.221 --> 32:36.722
Damn it.

32:36.755 --> 32:38.390
NARRATOR:
In a matter of just seconds,

32:38.424 --> 32:41.260
the 87-foot-tall D.M.T. shaft

32:41.293 --> 32:45.197
has filled to the level of
the water table or tide line.

32:45.231 --> 32:48.000
But is it really coming
from the ocean

32:48.034 --> 32:52.471
or somewhere else
deep underground?

32:52.504 --> 32:57.209
In 1804, members of the Onslow
Company excavated the Money Pit

32:57.243 --> 32:59.545
through nine platforms
of oak timbers

32:59.578 --> 33:02.348
down to a level of 90 feet.

33:02.381 --> 33:05.417
It was here that
they reportedly encountered

33:05.451 --> 33:07.586
a grayish-green stone slab

33:07.619 --> 33:10.656
covered
with strange hieroglyphs.

33:10.689 --> 33:15.161
Upon removing the stone,
the pit flooded with seawater

33:15.194 --> 33:19.731
from a tunnel later found
to originate at Smith's Cove.

33:19.765 --> 33:22.568
Since then,
every attempt to get

33:22.601 --> 33:25.437
to the bottom of the Money Pit
has been thwarted

33:25.471 --> 33:27.706
by what many believe
to be an elaborate network

33:27.739 --> 33:30.142
of flood tunnels
and booby traps,

33:30.176 --> 33:32.711
all designed
to protect whatever lies

33:32.744 --> 33:35.681
at the bottom of the pit.

33:35.714 --> 33:38.484
Could this be
what is happening now?

33:38.517 --> 33:40.652
Could the drilling caisson
have penetrated

33:40.686 --> 33:44.156
one of the original
booby

33:44.190 --> 33:45.457
ALEX:
Did you measure it, Mike?

33:45.491 --> 33:47.159
MIKE J.:
Scott measured it.

33:47.193 --> 33:49.528
It's 33 feet from the ground
or something,

33:49.561 --> 33:50.629
like it's always been.

33:50.662 --> 33:53.165
Wow, that was quick.

33:53.199 --> 33:54.733
RICK:
I mean, it's disappointing.

33:54.766 --> 33:56.468
Oak Island has...

33:56.502 --> 33:59.138
is a tough adversary,
if you will.

33:59.171 --> 34:02.174
But, as we always do,

34:02.208 --> 34:03.809
we move forward.

34:03.842 --> 34:06.245
Problem is, we have--
we're no further along

34:06.278 --> 34:08.680
in terms of where is this thing.

34:08.714 --> 34:11.183
Well, hopefully by probing,
we can...

34:11.217 --> 34:12.851
would've been nice
to been probing in the dry,

34:12.884 --> 34:15.354
but, you know, 'cause you
could've physically seen

34:15.387 --> 34:18.290
where it was going exactly,
but...

34:18.324 --> 34:21.293
Let's see
what this probing does.

34:21.327 --> 34:23.162
NARRATOR: The team
from Irving Equipment Limited

34:23.195 --> 34:26.398
will now use
a 25-foot-long piece of steel,

34:26.432 --> 34:28.267
known as an H-beam,

34:28.300 --> 34:32.371
to investigate the bottom
of the D.M.T. shaft.

34:32.404 --> 34:34.706
Using a process
known as probing,

34:34.740 --> 34:37.676
the team will use the beam
in the bottom of the shaft

34:37.709 --> 34:40.546
in order to determine
the size, surface area

34:40.579 --> 34:43.482
and orientation
of the obstruction.

34:43.515 --> 34:45.817
Let's go to the center.

34:45.851 --> 34:50.289
And if it's there, we're gonna
go 12 inches to the left.

34:52.658 --> 34:54.526
Good and solid there.

34:54.560 --> 34:56.262
So, then the question is
what is this?

34:56.295 --> 34:58.397
Yeah, exactly.

34:58.430 --> 35:02.501
You know, could be a piece
of cast steel.

35:02.534 --> 35:06.505
NARRATOR: After probing
the bottom of the D.M.T. shaft,

35:06.538 --> 35:08.607
it is Mike Jardine's assessment

35:08.640 --> 35:12.911
that the obstruction
is most likely made of steel.

35:12.944 --> 35:15.147
If true, it could mean

35:15.181 --> 35:17.549
the object was
placed there deliberately

35:17.583 --> 35:22.254
and hundreds of years ago,
as no existing records mention

35:22.288 --> 35:26.392
the use of steel
by previous treasure hunters.

35:26.425 --> 35:27.759
We've been talking
about this, Rick.

35:27.793 --> 35:29.595
I mean, undisturbed ground
down to there

35:29.628 --> 35:31.363
and you hit on
to something that big,

35:31.397 --> 35:34.566
that he feels is certain
is cast iron or

35:34.600 --> 35:38.904
Is-is this, is this shoring up
the roof of a tunnel?

35:38.937 --> 35:41.507
It could be something
other than that.

35:41.540 --> 35:43.675
You're in the vicinity
of the 90-foot level

35:43.709 --> 35:45.777
that the original Money Pit was
supposed to have flooded at.

35:45.811 --> 35:47.513
-Right, with this, with this
elevation change. -Yeah.

35:47.546 --> 35:50.416
What, I mean, if that is indeed

35:50.449 --> 35:53.485
a big piece of cast iron
or metal at that depth,

35:53.519 --> 35:54.786
how would it get there?

36:03.662 --> 36:05.397
What do you think, Danny?

36:05.431 --> 36:08.434
Um, I just, I... now I know why

36:08.467 --> 36:12.238
the loader bucket
had hot material in it.

36:12.271 --> 36:13.772
That much friction.

36:13.805 --> 36:16.608
Do you think
this is solid metal?

36:16.642 --> 36:20.312
The teeth are all gone
on my can, I'm gonna say yeah.

36:20.346 --> 36:23.349
RICK: I don't know what
to make of this assessment,

36:23.382 --> 36:26.652
that they are encountering
a steel plate at 90 feet.

36:26.685 --> 36:29.421
Well, 90 feet is where the stone
was found in the Money Pit,

36:29.455 --> 36:34.226
where the... where they were
just above the treasure vault.

36:34.260 --> 36:38.397
So, it's an interesting
concept, but prove it.

36:38.430 --> 36:39.665
So, that's where we're at.

36:39.698 --> 36:41.433
That's what we need to assess.

36:41.467 --> 36:43.769
So, if it is, it's intriguing.

36:43.802 --> 36:45.404
It is very intriguing.

36:45.437 --> 36:47.673
Why is it there?

36:55.981 --> 36:58.717
NARRATOR: As the sun sets
on Oak Island...

36:58.750 --> 36:59.785
Okay, well, look, guys.

36:59.818 --> 37:01.653
We have a decision to make.

37:01.687 --> 37:04.256
...Rick Lagina and members
of the Oak Island team

37:04.290 --> 37:07.693
gather in the war room
for an emergency meeting.

37:07.726 --> 37:09.761
The shutdown
at the Money Pit site

37:09.795 --> 37:13.565
is costing in excess
of $20,000 per day

37:13.599 --> 37:16.735
and they must now decide
whether to abandon the dig

37:16.768 --> 37:20.306
or find another way
to keep the operation going.

37:20.339 --> 37:22.007
Our options are
somewhat limited.

37:22.040 --> 37:24.710
Um, so I think we should
give Marty and Craig a call

37:24.743 --> 37:26.612
-and find out what their
opinion is. -All right.

37:26.645 --> 37:29.348
I'll get them on the screen.

37:29.381 --> 37:31.417
NARRATOR: Joining the meeting
via video conference

37:31.450 --> 37:33.752
from their offices
in Traverse City, Michigan

37:33.785 --> 37:35.721
are Rick's brother, Marty,

37:35.754 --> 37:38.324
and their friend and business
partner, Craig Tester.

37:38.357 --> 37:40.025
Hey, guys.

37:40.058 --> 37:41.793
-Ah, the fellowship.
-Hello.

37:41.827 --> 37:44.330
RICK:
Indeed. Um...

37:44.363 --> 37:47.633
reason for the call is, uh,

37:47.666 --> 37:50.636
you know, we're kind of, uh,
kind of stymied right now.

37:50.669 --> 37:52.738
We're on this obstruction.

37:52.771 --> 37:54.673
The question is,

37:54.706 --> 37:57.809
is it on a steel plate at...

37:57.843 --> 38:00.846
Pre-Dunfield, we would be
right around 90 feet.

38:00.879 --> 38:03.349
-Okay.
-Here's the problem.

38:03.382 --> 38:04.916
We dropped a camera down there,

38:04.950 --> 38:06.885
and we don't see...

38:06.918 --> 38:09.020
we don't see
this supposed steel plate.

38:09.054 --> 38:11.990
We could see from the camera

38:12.023 --> 38:15.494
that there were no teeth
on the can any longer,

38:15.527 --> 38:18.029
but almost immediately,
mud came in,

38:18.063 --> 38:21.833
and then water poured in,
and in a matter of seconds,

38:21.867 --> 38:23.835
it came up
to static water level.

38:23.869 --> 38:27.373
So we-we lost the opportunity
to go down there in the dry.

38:27.406 --> 38:28.707
-So, the question is...
-So, you're back...

38:28.740 --> 38:30.376
you're back full of water?

38:30.409 --> 38:32.077
Yes. So, the question is,

38:32.110 --> 38:35.046
what-what are our options
right now?

38:35.080 --> 38:38.917
-Okay. -We have preliminarily
looked into getting a diver,

38:38.950 --> 38:41.319
Mike Huntley, to go down hole.

38:43.389 --> 38:46.057
NARRATOR:
Over the past few years,

38:46.091 --> 38:48.026
veteran diver Mike Huntley

38:48.059 --> 38:49.995
has made a number
of exploratory dives

38:50.028 --> 38:52.864
on Oak Island,

38:52.898 --> 38:55.367
including one conducted
earlier this year

38:55.401 --> 38:56.802
in the C-1 shaft.

38:56.835 --> 38:58.970
We have zero visibility now.

38:59.004 --> 39:02.107
We're totally reliant
on what you find. Over.

39:02.140 --> 39:04.042
NARRATOR:
His knowledge and experience--

39:04.075 --> 39:07.546
especially when navigating
zero visibility situations--

39:07.579 --> 39:09.114
has proved invaluable

39:09.147 --> 39:11.383
to the team's
underwater search efforts.

39:16.422 --> 39:18.156
MARTY:
I would do that. Look, Rick,

39:18.189 --> 39:20.692
to go down there "in the dry,"

39:20.726 --> 39:22.127
I think, is mondo dangerous.

39:22.160 --> 39:25.030
Very, very dangerous. To go down

39:25.063 --> 39:27.032
with the static fluid level
on the inside,

39:27.065 --> 39:29.401
I don't think
is dangerous at all.

39:29.435 --> 39:31.637
I mean, not any more
than a normal dive.

39:31.670 --> 39:34.706
-Right. -So, I think
his task is very simple.

39:34.740 --> 39:37.976
What is it stopping this can?

39:38.009 --> 39:41.513
Yeah, Mike basically said
he's available whenever,

39:41.547 --> 39:43.081
but, of course,
it's logistics here.

39:43.114 --> 39:46.051
He needs to-to mob
and get here and...

39:46.084 --> 39:47.753
Yeah, well, tell him
to get after it.

39:47.786 --> 39:49.488
As soon as possible
would be great.

39:49.521 --> 39:51.089
Well, I think it's going to be
very interesting

39:51.122 --> 39:52.891
if the diver can prove it
to be a plate.

39:52.924 --> 39:55.494
I think it's going to be
a very interesting target.

39:55.527 --> 39:57.663
-Yes.
-Hey, look, if it's a plate,

39:57.696 --> 40:01.166
it could be hugely significant.

40:01.199 --> 40:02.901
-Yep.
-It could be the plate

40:02.934 --> 40:04.670
that covers the catch

40:04.703 --> 40:06.572
-that we're looking for.
-All right.

40:06.605 --> 40:07.839
RICK:
Not giving up.

40:07.873 --> 40:10.442
Not at all, not in the least.

40:10.476 --> 40:12.511
I still believe
we'll be successful.

40:12.544 --> 40:14.646
I still believe there's
something there to be found.

40:14.680 --> 40:16.648
Not giving up.

40:16.682 --> 40:19.084
We'll get on arranging the dive,

40:19.117 --> 40:20.652
and we'll keep you up-to-date.

40:20.686 --> 40:22.053
-Thanks.
-All right. See you.

40:22.087 --> 40:23.622
-See you.
-See you later.

40:23.655 --> 40:25.924
NARRATOR:
For Rick, Marty and the team,

40:25.957 --> 40:29.561
what started as a summer
of incredible opportunities

40:29.595 --> 40:31.897
has once again been threatened

40:31.930 --> 40:34.065
by a severe setback.

40:34.099 --> 40:37.869
But one thing
experience has taught them:

40:37.903 --> 40:41.540
giving up is not an option...

40:41.573 --> 40:44.543
and that just when the island
seems unwilling

40:44.576 --> 40:46.512
to unlock its secrets,

40:46.545 --> 40:49.815
something unexpected
is bound to happen.

40:49.848 --> 40:53.919
Something like the discovery
of a human bone

40:53.952 --> 40:57.088
or a mysterious lead cross,

40:57.122 --> 40:59.758
whose origins
may lead to a treasure

40:59.791 --> 41:03.495
far greater
than any ever imagined.

41:07.966 --> 41:10.636
Next time on
The Curse of Oak Island...

41:10.669 --> 41:12.804
You did work
out in Smith's Cove.

41:12.838 --> 41:14.906
DAN B.: That was put in
by the original people.

41:14.940 --> 41:16.708
