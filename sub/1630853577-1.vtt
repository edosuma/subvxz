Hello!
I'm Leo. You must be Nancy.

03:38.130 --> 03:39.567
That's right.

03:39.610 --> 03:42.483
May I come inside?
- Yes, of course.
Yes, of course.

03:49.316 --> 03:50.839
May I kiss you on the cheek?

03:51.622 --> 03:53.668
Yes, that would be fine.

04:00.152 --> 04:01.806
You smell wonderful.
- Thank you.

04:01.850 --> 04:04.113
What is it?
- Coco Chanel.

04:04.156 --> 04:05.288
Nigella Lawson wears it.

04:05.332 --> 04:07.899
Ah, Nigella. So sexy.

04:09.336 --> 04:10.946
Don't you agree?

04:10.989 --> 04:14.297
Yes, no, I... I was waiting
for you to say, "for her age".

04:14.341 --> 04:17.648
Most people say, when a woman's
over about 42, that she's sexy
"for her age."

04:17.692 --> 04:19.520
I was waiting...
I was waiting for that.

04:19.563 --> 04:23.263
Ah, right. Uh, no,
Nigella Lawson is empirically
sexy, at any age.

04:26.614 --> 04:28.659
Hey, Nancy?
- Yes?

04:28.703 --> 04:30.966
We're gonna have a great time.
- OK.

04:31.009 --> 04:32.097
OK.

04:45.154 --> 04:46.677
I tell you what
I'd love right now...

04:46.721 --> 04:48.331
What?
- A drink.

04:48.375 --> 04:50.420
A drink, of course,
of course. Sorry.

04:50.855 --> 04:52.292
What can I get you?

04:52.335 --> 04:54.163
How about a glass of fizz
to ease us into the mood.

04:54.206 --> 04:56.165
A glass of fizz. Hold on.

04:59.386 --> 05:00.474
Allow me.

05:13.530 --> 05:14.923
For you.
- Thanks very much.

05:20.407 --> 05:21.973
To being empirically sexy.

05:23.671 --> 05:26.151
Yes. I'll drink to that.

05:31.548 --> 05:33.071
A very fine vintage.

05:33.463 --> 05:34.769
It's just from the minibar.

05:36.597 --> 05:38.816
Oh, you meant me.

05:38.860 --> 05:40.078
Me.
- I'm just teasing.

05:40.122 --> 05:41.732
Righto, righto.
- Shall we sit?

05:41.776 --> 05:42.777
Yes, let's sit.

05:51.089 --> 05:53.396
So, what would you--
- So, you enjoy music...

05:53.440 --> 05:54.919
by people?

05:55.616 --> 05:56.747
Yeah, I do.

05:57.444 --> 05:59.315
What kind of music do you like?

05:59.837 --> 06:02.362
Oh, I don't know.
All sorts, um...

06:03.058 --> 06:05.190
Sorry, I'm a bit
distracted cos, um...

06:05.974 --> 06:08.542
cos up close you really are
very good-looking.

06:09.281 --> 06:11.327
Mm.
- Thank you.

06:12.067 --> 06:14.591
Even more than in your photo.

06:14.635 --> 06:15.984
Ah, I'm better in 3D.

06:17.638 --> 06:18.595
Mm.

06:19.117 --> 06:21.642
I hope that you received, um...

06:21.685 --> 06:23.644
the contractual.

06:23.687 --> 06:25.515
Oh, the money?

06:25.559 --> 06:28.257
The money, yes, sorry.
I didn't want to be crass
and just say it.

06:28.300 --> 06:32.217
There's nothing crass about
getting paid for your work,
Nancy, trust me on that.

06:32.261 --> 06:34.263
And thank you,
it's all received.

06:36.004 --> 06:38.223
Are you Irish?
- Yes, I am.

06:39.573 --> 06:41.270
Have you been doing this long?

06:41.313 --> 06:43.620
A little while now, yeah.

06:44.099 --> 06:45.840
Long enough to know some things.

06:45.883 --> 06:46.841
Do you enjoy it?

06:46.884 --> 06:48.625
You know what? I love it, Nancy.

06:48.669 --> 06:53.064
Meeting all kinds of people,
getting up to all sorts
of things...

06:53.630 --> 06:55.110
mutual pleasure.

06:55.153 --> 06:58.243
You don't feel... demeaned then?

07:01.333 --> 07:02.509
Not at all.

07:02.987 --> 07:04.859
Or degraded?
- No.

07:05.294 --> 07:07.688
But what if you meet someone
and you really just...

07:07.731 --> 07:09.516
don't want to do it?

07:09.559 --> 07:10.952
Hasn't happened yet.

07:10.995 --> 07:12.040
Really?
- Really.

07:12.083 --> 07:13.215
I find that astonishing.

07:14.129 --> 07:16.436
How many have you...
- Oh, a gentleman never tells.

07:16.479 --> 07:18.002
Oh, of course, yes.

07:18.829 --> 07:21.528
You don't have to worry, Nancy.
This is just about us tonight.

07:22.790 --> 07:24.400
So, what is your fantasy?

07:26.141 --> 07:27.229
Um...

07:27.882 --> 07:30.972
I'm not sure you could really
class it as a fantasy as such.

07:31.015 --> 07:32.713
It's a bit mundane for that.

07:32.756 --> 07:35.629
OK, well, what
would you most desire?

07:35.672 --> 07:37.544
I mean, desires
are never mundane.

07:38.588 --> 07:39.981
Um...

07:42.549 --> 07:43.898
to have sex...

07:45.203 --> 07:47.075
tonight, um, with you.

07:48.685 --> 07:50.818
That's about it, really.

07:50.861 --> 07:52.297
For the moment.

07:52.341 --> 07:54.125
Great.
- But do you mind?

07:54.169 --> 07:56.345
Do you want... I mean, am I...

07:57.607 --> 07:59.391
...a disappointment,
so to speak?

08:16.104 --> 08:17.279
OK?

08:17.671 --> 08:19.368
OK, OK.
- Top-up?

08:19.411 --> 08:20.369
Yes, please.

08:29.900 --> 08:30.988
Thank you.

08:36.907 --> 08:38.779
I'm sorry, I just can't bear
the suspense.

08:39.301 --> 08:41.042
Can... Could we...

08:41.085 --> 08:43.044
Would it be alright
if we just did it now?

08:43.087 --> 08:45.307
Right now? And get it over with?

08:45.350 --> 08:46.917
Get it over with?
- Yes.

08:46.961 --> 08:48.919
You're meant to enjoy it.

08:48.963 --> 08:51.139
No, I know that,
I'm just not very good at
waiting for things to happen.

08:51.182 --> 08:53.881
I'm much better when they've
happened and I'm... recovering.

08:53.924 --> 08:57.624
You make it sound like it's
an ordeal. It's not compulsory.

08:58.450 --> 09:00.452
Shall we just sit and chat
for a bit?

09:00.496 --> 09:01.976
Oh no, I don't want to do that.

09:02.019 --> 09:03.543
I don't think we'd
have very much in common.

09:03.586 --> 09:06.197
You might be surprised.
- I am very rarely surprised.

09:06.763 --> 09:09.331
I like to plan things properly,
specifically

09:09.374 --> 09:11.638
in order to avoid
being surprised, if I'm honest.

09:11.681 --> 09:15.032
Fine, but I hope
I can surprise you anyway.

09:16.338 --> 09:18.949
N... No, I don't want anything
like that.

09:18.993 --> 09:20.081
Anything like what?

09:20.603 --> 09:22.344
You know, anything perverted.

09:23.258 --> 09:25.129
Oh, no, no, no.
Not that kind of surprise.

09:25.173 --> 09:27.523
Oh good, I don't like anything
going in to places

09:27.567 --> 09:29.569
that are designed for
things to come out.

09:29.612 --> 09:31.179
You're talking about anal sex?

09:31.222 --> 09:32.659
I don't like that phrase.

09:32.702 --> 09:35.662
Nancy, I won't be doing anything
you don't want me to do.

09:35.705 --> 09:37.664
I've never done
anything like this before.

09:37.707 --> 09:39.883
I've never bought
anybody like this for my own...

09:39.927 --> 09:41.319
Pleasure.
- ...use.

09:43.191 --> 09:46.455
Nancy, listen to me.
I choose to do this.
- Yes. Right.

09:47.282 --> 09:50.633
You know, you haven't bought me,
you've bought my service.

09:51.112 --> 09:52.940
I set a price and you agreed.

09:53.767 --> 09:55.116
I'm not being exploited.

09:55.159 --> 09:57.814
I can't bear the suspense.
I can't bear it.

09:57.858 --> 09:59.511
The anticipation?
- Yes...

10:00.687 --> 10:02.253
of disappointment.

10:02.297 --> 10:04.255
Why do you assume
you'll be disappointed?

10:08.608 --> 10:12.176
Because I've always been
disappointed before.

10:14.396 --> 10:17.399
I need to... Well, actually,
I'd like to tell you something.

10:17.442 --> 10:18.574
OK.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.315
I've never had an orgasm.

10:22.056 --> 10:23.927
With a partner?
- With anyone.

10:24.362 --> 10:26.843
Or by yourself?
- No. Not even by myself.

10:27.365 --> 10:28.976
N... Never.

10:29.019 --> 10:30.107
That's right.

10:30.717 --> 10:32.283
Right. I see.

10:32.327 --> 10:34.721
It's not meant as a challenge.
- I haven't taken it as one.

10:34.764 --> 10:37.201
Cos you won't be able
to achieve it.
- Fair enough.

10:39.856 --> 10:42.467
Your confidence is endearing,
and no doubt necessary
to the job

10:42.511 --> 10:45.166
but I feel I must warn you
it is misplaced.

10:45.601 --> 10:47.690
Um, and I don't want
you to feel bad about it

10:47.734 --> 10:50.388
because I won't be faking it.
I don't do that. Not anymore.

10:50.432 --> 10:53.435
Um, I made a decision
after my husband died

10:53.478 --> 10:55.089
never to fake an orgasm again.

10:58.048 --> 10:59.267
When did he die?

10:59.310 --> 11:01.573
Uh, two years ago.
It was premature.

11:02.662 --> 11:04.838
And is this your first...

11:04.881 --> 11:08.493
Encounter since then?
Yes. In fact, if we do this,
you will...

11:10.365 --> 11:13.107
...only be the second man I have
ever had sex with in
my entire life.

11:14.021 --> 11:16.371
There, I said it.

11:16.414 --> 11:17.894
Well, thank you for telling me.

11:18.808 --> 11:22.986
If you want to leave now,
I'm very happy to pay half
of what we agreed.

11:24.553 --> 11:26.903
I don't want to leave, Nancy.

11:28.296 --> 11:30.298
Nothing is
making me want to leave.

11:31.429 --> 11:33.736
I won't leave unless I'm clearly
instructed to

11:33.780 --> 11:35.346
or I feel I'm
in physical danger.

11:36.478 --> 11:39.307
Has that ever happened?
- Yeah. A couple of times.

11:39.916 --> 11:42.571
With a woman?
- Yeah. Once with a woman.

11:42.614 --> 11:45.400
Well, her husband, he thought...
He wanted a threesome.

11:45.443 --> 11:46.749
But it turned out he didn't.

11:47.271 --> 11:48.882
Did she?
- No...

11:48.925 --> 11:51.145
but she did want to meet
one-on-one a week later.

11:51.798 --> 11:53.843
And did you do that?
- Sure.

11:54.931 --> 11:57.064
Wasn't that dishonest?
- Of her?

11:57.107 --> 11:58.152
Of you.

11:59.675 --> 12:02.678
Why? I mean, I'm not the married
one. I'm just doing my job.

12:05.246 --> 12:06.203
Wow.

12:07.552 --> 12:09.032
It's all quite an education.

12:09.076 --> 12:10.599
I hope it continues.

12:11.818 --> 12:13.297
You're being saucy.

12:13.341 --> 12:17.040
"Saucy"? My grandmother
used to say the word "saucy".

12:17.084 --> 12:19.129
I'd rather not think about
your grandmother right now

12:19.173 --> 12:20.217
if you don't mind.

12:20.261 --> 12:21.784
No problem.
- I just... Anyway...

12:21.828 --> 12:24.178
I just wanted to let you know
about the orgasm thing.

12:24.221 --> 12:26.746
I'm not expecting one, so um,
you can relax.

12:27.529 --> 12:29.096
I am relaxed.

12:29.531 --> 12:31.011
This was a terrible idea.

12:34.841 --> 12:37.321
Do you feel you're somehow
betraying your husband?

12:38.322 --> 12:39.541
His memory, I mean.

12:39.584 --> 12:42.631
What? Oh no, no, no, no, no.

12:42.674 --> 12:44.502
No, it's nothing like that.
- Then what?

12:44.546 --> 12:47.418
It's just not very "me", I'm a
teacher... Well, I was a teacher

12:47.462 --> 12:51.031
I... I used to set my pupils
essays on the moral issues
surrounding sex work

12:51.074 --> 12:53.685
and here I am...
participating in it.
- Nancy.

12:53.729 --> 12:56.253
You're probably a very
vulnerable young man,
maybe you're an orphan.

12:56.297 --> 12:58.168
I'm not an orphan.

12:58.212 --> 13:00.040
Yeah, or perhaps you grew up
in care, you've got
very low self-esteem.

13:00.083 --> 13:01.781
I didn't grow up in care.

13:01.824 --> 13:03.652
You could've been trafficked
against your will,
you can't tell

13:03.695 --> 13:05.523
just by looking at somebody.
- I wasn't trafficked
against my will.

13:05.567 --> 13:08.135
Well, then I simply
don't understand it.
- You don't understand what?

13:08.178 --> 13:09.310
Why you're doing this.

13:09.832 --> 13:12.661
Oh. Oh, well, if
you really want to know

13:12.704 --> 13:16.665
I'm... I'm using
the money I make doing this
to save up for college.

13:16.708 --> 13:17.666
Oh.

13:18.362 --> 13:20.887
Oh, how wonderful.
Are you really?

13:21.844 --> 13:22.932
No.

13:22.976 --> 13:24.238
Oh.

13:24.716 --> 13:28.155
Nancy, you need to stop worrying
about me...

13:28.198 --> 13:29.983
- ...let's move this
back to you.

13:30.026 --> 13:31.811
OK. Oh, God.
- Now, Nancy...

13:31.854 --> 13:34.074
This is crazy,
it's terrible, it's wrong.
- Nancy.

13:34.465 --> 13:36.859
My son... My son
would be appalled.

13:36.903 --> 13:37.991
Nancy.
- Yes.

13:38.034 --> 13:39.514
Let's go to bed.
- OK.

13:39.557 --> 13:40.994
OK?

13:41.037 --> 13:42.386
OK.
- Good.

13:45.563 --> 13:46.782
Come here.
- Mm-hmm.

13:50.394 --> 13:51.656
Is this OK?

13:59.055 --> 14:00.709
OK?
- Mm.

14:00.752 --> 14:01.797
Mm-hmm.

14:12.764 --> 14:13.940
Mm.

14:25.821 --> 14:28.780
Listen, er, if you, um,
need to take anything

14:28.824 --> 14:29.651
that's fine by me.

14:29.694 --> 14:30.870
I'm fine, Nancy.

14:30.913 --> 14:32.915
I mean legal things, you know,
to help...

14:32.959 --> 14:35.222
with it all down there.
- No, I assure you,
it all works.

14:35.265 --> 14:37.137
I know, I mean, I just...

14:37.180 --> 14:39.487
No, I know what you mean, but
I don't need any little
blue pills.

14:39.879 --> 14:41.532
Never?
- Never.

14:41.576 --> 14:43.491
But what if you
don't fancy the person?

14:43.534 --> 14:46.233
I mean, you can't force
yourself, surely, if you don't.

14:46.276 --> 14:47.930
There's always
something to fancy.

14:47.974 --> 14:49.410
No, there isn't.
- There is.

14:49.453 --> 14:50.498
Oh.

14:51.586 --> 14:53.805
What's the oldest person
you've ever done it with?

14:53.849 --> 14:55.416
That's a bit reductive, Nancy.

14:55.807 --> 14:58.245
"Reductive", that's a good word.
I like it.

14:58.288 --> 15:00.073
Yes, it is a good word.

15:00.116 --> 15:02.292
I'm glad you like it.
I chose it just for you.

15:02.336 --> 15:03.641
But seriously

15:03.685 --> 15:05.687
actually I really do
want to know, how old?

15:08.342 --> 15:09.778
Eighty-two.
- Eighty-two?

15:09.821 --> 15:11.040
Yes.
- Eighty-two!

15:11.084 --> 15:12.346
Yeah.
- Eighty-two.

15:12.389 --> 15:13.347
Nancy.

15:15.088 --> 15:17.046
OK, I'm feeling a
bit better now.
- OK.

15:17.090 --> 15:18.134
Um...

15:19.266 --> 15:21.268
So, what's the
little thing about me

15:21.311 --> 15:24.010
that you can hold onto
with all your might?

15:25.141 --> 15:27.317
To make you come alive
in the moment?

15:30.059 --> 15:31.147
Come here.

15:42.158 --> 15:43.290
I like your mouth.

15:48.904 --> 15:52.516
I like the line of your neck,
down to about here.

15:58.566 --> 15:59.697
And this...

16:01.482 --> 16:02.787
it's so elegant.

16:05.747 --> 16:08.837
Um, just... hang on a second.

16:08.880 --> 16:12.667
I'll just, um... I'll just go
to the bathroom and change.

16:12.710 --> 16:14.060
OK, but don't change too much.

16:14.103 --> 16:15.191
Oh, God.

18:12.917 --> 18:14.049
Ta-dah.

18:14.484 --> 18:15.877
Ooh!

18:15.920 --> 18:17.096
You look great.

18:27.497 --> 18:29.238
Oh, um, everything OK?

18:29.282 --> 18:32.111
Yes, it's just,
I don't like Mars bars.
I can smell it.

18:32.154 --> 18:33.460
It's a bit off-putting.

18:33.503 --> 18:35.418
Oh, sorry, sorry.
I'll go and clean my teeth.

18:35.462 --> 18:37.072
Would you mind? Thank you.

19:04.099 --> 19:05.231
What's this?

19:11.062 --> 19:13.108
Very nice.
- I've changed my mind again.

19:13.761 --> 19:16.503
I don't want to do it.
I'm sorry to have
wasted your time.

19:16.546 --> 19:18.026
You... I'll still pay.

19:18.069 --> 19:19.941
But you can get dressed and go.

19:25.381 --> 19:27.166
This isn't about
the Mars bar, is it?

19:27.949 --> 19:29.559
No, it's not about the Mars bar.

19:29.603 --> 19:31.213
Do you not find me attractive?

19:31.257 --> 19:32.649
Don't be ridiculous.

19:33.084 --> 19:34.260
You're clearly...

19:35.261 --> 19:37.959
aesthetically perfect,
and apparently nice enough.

19:39.482 --> 19:41.441
What did you picture happening,
I mean...

19:42.355 --> 19:44.966
why did you book me
if you don't want to do it?

19:45.009 --> 19:48.535
I don't know at this point.
A moment of madness, that's all.

19:48.578 --> 19:49.797
That's all.

19:50.624 --> 19:52.887
Do you regularly have moments
of madness like this?

19:52.930 --> 19:53.888
No.

19:54.715 --> 19:56.978
Do you usually
make rational decisions?

19:57.935 --> 19:59.067
Yes.

20:00.590 --> 20:02.462
Then why would
this be any different?

20:03.202 --> 20:05.160
I mean, you must
have had a reason.

20:05.204 --> 20:08.990
Something that made you do it.
I bet you thought about it for
days before.

20:09.556 --> 20:12.472
Weeks... Well,
months. Years, perhaps.

20:13.386 --> 20:15.214
Well, then it's
not a moment of madness.

20:17.346 --> 20:19.305
This is what you want, Nancy.

20:20.480 --> 20:22.699
And now that you have it,
why won't you take it?

20:23.657 --> 20:27.182
Why won't you take what you want
when it's right here,
within reach.

20:27.748 --> 20:31.099
Oh, I don't know.
It feels controversial suddenly.

20:31.142 --> 20:32.753
I don't find it controversial.

20:32.796 --> 20:35.495
To want something
like this. Even to want it.

20:40.326 --> 20:42.153
If it's just sex you want

20:42.197 --> 20:44.852
aren't there a dozen men around
who'd love to hook up with you?

20:44.895 --> 20:47.594
If it's all too much...
I mean, surely they want to.

20:47.637 --> 20:49.204
Oh, yeah... Yes, they do, um...

20:49.857 --> 20:52.294
Yes, they made that very clear
actually since Robert died

20:52.338 --> 20:54.340
but um, it's
me, I don't want to.

20:54.383 --> 20:55.515
Why not?

20:56.255 --> 20:57.430
They're all old.

20:58.039 --> 21:01.129
Old men. I don't want an
old man. I want a young one.

21:01.956 --> 21:06.134
A young body. And no offence,
I have to pay for that, of
course I do.

21:07.353 --> 21:10.660
Well, I'm here,
and I'm not offended.

21:10.704 --> 21:12.706
Actually, why
are you still here?

21:12.749 --> 21:15.056
I've just offered to pay you to
spend an evening doing whatever
you please.

21:15.099 --> 21:16.100
Why are you still here?

21:16.144 --> 21:17.145
I'm interested.
- In what?

21:17.188 --> 21:18.407
In you.
- Oh, for Heaven's sakes

21:18.451 --> 21:19.887
no need to patronise me.
- I'm not.

21:20.496 --> 21:21.889
You're conflicted.

21:22.585 --> 21:24.761
Conflicted is interesting.

21:24.805 --> 21:27.895
You've never met a woman who
can't make up her mind before?
I don't believe that.

21:27.938 --> 21:30.811
I've met women who can't decide
which sandwich to have for lunch

21:30.854 --> 21:34.467
but if we've ended up in a
bedroom together, they usually
know what they want

21:34.510 --> 21:35.642
at that point.

21:35.685 --> 21:37.339
Well, young women are different.

21:37.383 --> 21:38.427
Yes, I think they are.

21:39.385 --> 21:42.779
Different to how we
were... well, how I was when
I was young.

21:44.303 --> 21:46.609
I wasn't actually
a social renegade, anyway.

21:46.653 --> 21:50.221
A couple of my friends were,
but we lost touch after school.

21:50.265 --> 21:53.137
But London was a
different country back then.

21:53.181 --> 21:56.532
The rest of us were stuck
in the 1950s, it was repressive.

21:56.576 --> 21:57.794
Sorry.

21:57.838 --> 21:59.100
And I wasn't brimming

21:59.143 --> 22:00.710
with sexual confidence
like they all are now

22:00.754 --> 22:03.496
with their thigh-split dresses
and salsa classes and whatnot.

22:03.539 --> 22:06.673
I mean, people do pole dancing
for a hobby.

22:06.716 --> 22:08.936
I've read about it,
I read an article about it.

22:09.545 --> 22:11.373
I mean, a hobby?

22:11.417 --> 22:12.896
Wh... I...

22:12.940 --> 22:14.681
Christ, I sound so old.

22:14.724 --> 22:17.510
I know I sound old, but
Leo, did you ever meet anyone

22:17.553 --> 22:20.208
who does pole
dancing for a hobby?

22:20.251 --> 22:22.123
I think that's
mainly for posh girls.

22:22.732 --> 22:23.951
Yes, you're probably right.

22:24.778 --> 22:27.389
I mean, I know pole dancers
but they wouldn't pay to do it.

22:27.433 --> 22:30.349
That's just some fucked up
economics, do you know
what I mean?

22:30.392 --> 22:32.394
Not really, but I mean,
I can imagine.

22:32.438 --> 22:34.091
It's not a world
I know much about.

22:34.657 --> 22:37.878
Says the woman who booked a
hotel and a sex worker for
the night.

22:37.921 --> 22:40.533
Oh, God. Oh, oh, you're right.

22:40.576 --> 22:42.839
Oh, God, I'm just
a seedy old pervert.

22:42.883 --> 22:46.147
Just go. It's disgusting.
I feel like Rolf Harris all of
a sudden.

22:46.887 --> 22:47.975
Rolf Harris?

22:48.932 --> 22:49.977
Never mind.

22:51.979 --> 22:53.502
Come on, let's get in the bed.

22:53.546 --> 22:55.809
- Let's get under the covers.

22:59.726 --> 23:01.858
Why do they
make these things like...

23:01.902 --> 23:03.469
getting into a straight-jacket?

23:03.512 --> 23:04.644
It's ridiculous.

23:19.136 --> 23:21.312
What do you really want to do
with your life?

23:22.270 --> 23:25.012
I'd like to see, er,
Venus before I die.

23:25.055 --> 23:26.317
OK.

23:27.014 --> 23:30.409
I'm just curious about
what it's like for you.

23:30.452 --> 23:31.975
You're clearly very bright.

23:32.411 --> 23:33.803
What makes you say that?

23:33.847 --> 23:35.283
Well, I'm a teacher, and I know

23:35.326 --> 23:37.459
there are some people who use
the word "empirically"

23:37.503 --> 23:39.896
in a conversation, and
there are very many who don't.

23:39.940 --> 23:41.332
And the clever ones are
those that do.

23:41.376 --> 23:42.725
Did I use it?

23:42.769 --> 23:44.727
Yes. Nigella. "Empirically
sexy". And "reductive".

23:44.771 --> 23:46.642
Oh, yes, you're right. So I did.

23:47.687 --> 23:50.864
So, what, you don't think this
is a job for clever people, is
that it?

23:50.907 --> 23:52.735
No! No, no,
I didn't mean that. No.

23:52.779 --> 23:55.651
No, I was just asking about
qualifications and...

23:56.347 --> 23:57.392
Did you go to school?

23:59.220 --> 24:02.702
Of course. I mean, my mother was
a very strict Irish Catholic.

24:04.181 --> 24:06.532
And what does she think about
what you're doing now?

24:07.620 --> 24:09.709
You want to talk
about my mother? Really?

24:10.100 --> 24:12.538
Well, you brought her up.
- Well now I'm dropping it.

24:14.191 --> 24:15.149
But seriously...

24:17.847 --> 24:19.066
She doesn't know.

24:20.720 --> 24:22.983
You know, this
looks so sexy on you.

24:23.026 --> 24:24.419
What does she think you do?

24:25.028 --> 24:26.421
If I tell you, can we drop it?

24:26.465 --> 24:28.641
Because you really
do look good in this.

24:28.684 --> 24:30.077
I promise.

24:33.341 --> 24:35.996
She thinks I work on an oil rig.

24:39.347 --> 24:40.391
An oil rig?

24:40.435 --> 24:42.002
Yes, an oil rig.
In the North Sea.

24:46.136 --> 24:48.095
No, but... But do...

24:48.138 --> 24:50.576
Do you keep in contact?
Do you send her updates

24:50.619 --> 24:53.013
about life on the oil rig?
- Now, Nancy, you promised.

24:53.056 --> 24:55.798
But how do you know what happens
on an oil rig?

24:55.842 --> 24:57.496
I Google it, you know.

24:57.539 --> 25:00.107
I found a website where there's
stories about life on an oil rig

25:00.150 --> 25:01.848
and I copy and
paste them sometimes.

25:01.891 --> 25:04.285
Ha. That's amazing. What a life.

25:04.938 --> 25:08.681
Oh, dear. Meanwhile, my son's
doing his Masters at university.

25:08.724 --> 25:09.899
Are you not happy about that?

25:09.943 --> 25:12.032
Oh, yes, no, I am,
of course I'm happy.

25:12.075 --> 25:13.468
It's great.

25:13.512 --> 25:15.383
Why wouldn't I be happy?
It's just what's expected.

25:15.426 --> 25:17.472
Why do you sound
so ambivalent about it?

25:17.516 --> 25:19.561
"Ambivalent", that's
another good word.
- Mm-hmm.

25:19.605 --> 25:21.389
So... your son?

25:21.432 --> 25:23.696
Yes, well, I...
I... I... Oh dear.

25:24.435 --> 25:26.960
I've never said this to
anyone before, this is awful.

25:27.003 --> 25:28.962
It's OK, who am I going to tell?

25:29.615 --> 25:30.616
Come on.

25:31.138 --> 25:33.575
I... well, the truth is
I find him boring.

25:37.144 --> 25:38.972
You find your own son boring?

25:39.015 --> 25:40.582
Yes. That's awful, isn't it?

25:40.626 --> 25:42.802
I've just never heard anyone
say that before.

25:43.977 --> 25:45.892
Have you always
found him boring?

25:45.935 --> 25:48.721
No, not always.
No, he's a very nice boy.

25:48.764 --> 25:51.637
He's just very predictable,
like his father.

25:51.680 --> 25:52.812
What's he studying?

25:52.855 --> 25:54.596
Chemistry. Please
forget I said that.

25:54.640 --> 25:57.817
Just forget it, he's a lovely
boy and I love him very much

25:57.860 --> 26:00.602
and I should be grateful because
he's turned out very well.

26:00.646 --> 26:01.777
Any other kids?

26:01.821 --> 26:03.910
Mm. Daughter. Older.
We don't get along.

26:04.388 --> 26:05.520
Oh, why not?

26:05.564 --> 26:06.565
She thinks I'm cold.

26:07.217 --> 26:08.436
And what do you think?

26:08.479 --> 26:09.698
I don't think I'm cold.

26:10.351 --> 26:12.353
I mean, I don't feel cold inside

26:12.396 --> 26:17.576
but maybe I'm cold with her
because she's so over the top
all the time.

26:18.577 --> 26:20.100
So the opposite to her brother.

26:20.927 --> 26:24.060
She lives in Barcelona,
in this bohemian set-up.

26:24.104 --> 26:26.759
They're all artists, although
I've never seen any actual art.

26:26.802 --> 26:29.892
Unless the art consists of
burning your parents' money,
which...

26:29.936 --> 26:31.807
Actually, it's not
out of the question.

26:32.634 --> 26:33.896
At least she's not boring.

26:33.940 --> 26:35.898
No, no, there is
that. There is that.

26:38.031 --> 26:41.687
So your children have
disappointed you, Nancy.

26:41.730 --> 26:45.212
Yes. But when did
you last see your mum?

26:46.561 --> 26:47.780
Why?

26:47.823 --> 26:50.391
Cos I'm interested in
where you come from.

26:51.131 --> 26:52.523
I don't come from anywhere.

26:53.481 --> 26:56.963
You know, I was actually found
under a little patch of
mushrooms

26:57.006 --> 26:59.748
size of a bean,
raised by friendly wolves.

27:07.495 --> 27:09.062
Oh, go on. Tell me something.

27:10.019 --> 27:12.674
I'm in awe of
anyone who becomes a mother.

27:14.154 --> 27:15.677
Hardest job in the world.

27:16.373 --> 27:18.637
Did you get that off Mumsnet
or something?

27:18.680 --> 27:19.986
Sorry?

27:20.029 --> 27:22.249
It's a bit general.
Not all mothers are good.

27:23.598 --> 27:26.601
Well, I wouldn't know.
I've only had one.

27:26.645 --> 27:28.864
Yeah, we're all stuck with
whatever we get, aren't we?

27:28.908 --> 27:30.387
Parents and children alike.

27:31.040 --> 27:32.955
At least I know what mine
are up to, though.

27:32.999 --> 27:35.784
Haven't you ever wondered if
your son is lying to you
about his life?

27:36.437 --> 27:37.873
No.
- Why not?

27:39.222 --> 27:41.137
Maybe he doesn't
want to disappoint you.

28:00.635 --> 28:02.028
Has he got a partner?

28:02.071 --> 28:04.160
Yes. Nice girl, also boring.

28:04.204 --> 28:07.207
Training to be a primary school
teacher. Boring, boring, boring.

28:07.773 --> 28:09.731
I thought you said you were
a schoolteacher?

28:09.775 --> 28:11.472
Yeah, but I was
a Religious Education teacher

28:11.515 --> 28:13.474
in a secondary school. That's
a very different beast to...

28:14.040 --> 28:15.737
colouring in with six-year-olds.

28:15.781 --> 28:18.044
They say primary education
is the most important.

28:18.087 --> 28:19.698
Well, they're wrong.

28:20.829 --> 28:23.223
D'you know what proportion of
secondary school students think

28:23.266 --> 28:26.008
that Religious Education is
worth even an ounce of their
time and attention?

28:26.052 --> 28:27.444
I mean, I...
- No, well, exactly.

28:27.488 --> 28:29.664
Exactly. So there I would be,
year after year

28:29.708 --> 28:32.754
spouting the same old stuff,
unable to break away from
the curriculum

28:32.798 --> 28:35.235
in case I got complaints from
the head and unable to ask them

28:35.278 --> 28:37.672
anything real
in case we lost time

28:37.716 --> 28:39.108
and just
battling through the work

28:39.152 --> 28:40.936
and getting
them through the exams

28:40.980 --> 28:42.677
and then you just start again
the following year

28:42.721 --> 28:44.723
doing the same old stuff.
It was just stultifying.

28:48.944 --> 28:50.641
I think I may
have killed the mood.

28:50.685 --> 28:52.295
I'm not sure there was a mood.

28:53.079 --> 28:55.385
I'm sorry, that was rude of me.
- No, it's true.

28:55.429 --> 28:57.605
No, but you're not paying
for the truth, though.

28:58.084 --> 28:59.433
You're paying for a fantasy.

28:59.868 --> 29:02.044
At this moment,
I'm not sure what I'm
paying for.

29:07.833 --> 29:08.921
I can show you.

29:10.574 --> 29:11.750
I don't doubt it.

29:13.969 --> 29:15.797
What would get
you back in the mood?

29:15.841 --> 29:17.277
Hmm?

29:17.320 --> 29:19.540
What would your husband do
to get it all going again?

29:23.152 --> 29:24.284
Um...

29:24.327 --> 29:25.372
Well...

29:26.286 --> 29:28.375
He... He would, er...

29:30.159 --> 29:32.727
take all his clothes off,
and lie in the bed

29:33.772 --> 29:35.556
without putting his pyjamas on.

29:35.991 --> 29:37.732
And I would take
all my clothes off

29:38.211 --> 29:39.299
put my nightie on

29:39.342 --> 29:40.822
and lie in the bed next to him

29:41.518 --> 29:43.869
and then he would rub my
shoulders and breasts a bit

29:43.912 --> 29:46.088
and then he would climb on top,
do the business

29:46.132 --> 29:48.047
kiss my cheek, roll off,
put his pyjamas on

29:48.090 --> 29:49.309
and go back to sleep.

29:50.876 --> 29:52.138
That's it?
- That's it.

29:52.703 --> 29:53.879
Always?
- Always.

29:53.922 --> 29:56.011
No deviation for 31 years.

29:57.056 --> 29:59.058
And that's the
only sex you've ever had?

29:59.101 --> 30:00.363
Correct.

30:02.713 --> 30:03.758
Wow.

30:05.194 --> 30:06.587
"Wow" indeed.

30:07.936 --> 30:09.242
No oral?

30:09.285 --> 30:10.896
No oral.
- Not even on him?

30:10.939 --> 30:12.419
No, he said it was demeaning.

30:12.898 --> 30:14.334
For you?
- For him.

30:14.377 --> 30:16.075
OK...

30:17.076 --> 30:19.600
OK, and I presume it was
the same for him on you?

30:20.079 --> 30:22.255
Yes, he said that was demeaning
for him too.

30:25.345 --> 30:26.563
So, you've never had...

30:28.043 --> 30:29.915
No, I've never had.

30:31.003 --> 30:32.091
Never given.

30:34.223 --> 30:35.181
Do you want to?

30:35.224 --> 30:36.443
Yes, I do. I want to.

30:37.226 --> 30:38.358
I want to very much.

30:38.401 --> 30:39.750
I always have done.

30:41.361 --> 30:42.492
Sorry.

30:42.536 --> 30:43.885
I'm sorry to cry.

30:43.929 --> 30:45.321
It's stupid.

30:47.410 --> 30:48.455
I, um...

30:50.239 --> 30:51.893
I think that...

30:56.942 --> 30:59.727
Well, when I was a... a teenager

30:59.770 --> 31:03.513
my parents took me
to Greece on holiday

31:04.471 --> 31:08.344
um, it was a once-in-a-lifetime
trip, for them, anyway, and...

31:09.084 --> 31:09.998
um...

31:10.999 --> 31:14.133
at the hotel there was this
waiter, I think
he was about 20

31:15.308 --> 31:20.226
and he looked at me like I
was... the most delicious thing
he'd ever seen

31:20.966 --> 31:23.664
and I felt my body go to water.

31:24.534 --> 31:28.451
And one night, he was
hanging around after his shift

31:28.495 --> 31:30.323
and um, I was hot

31:31.193 --> 31:35.589
so I went out into the garden
after my parents had gone to bed

31:35.632 --> 31:38.418
and he was there,
smoking a cigarette

31:38.461 --> 31:43.379
and, um... I stood

31:43.858 --> 31:49.168
in front of this little bush
covered in tiny pink flowers

31:49.211 --> 31:50.386
looking out to sea...

31:52.475 --> 31:55.174
and without a
word, he came up and...

31:56.566 --> 31:57.916
...kissed my neck

31:58.786 --> 32:02.181
and put his hand under my skirt
and into my knickers

32:02.877 --> 32:06.750
and I could feel him
sliding around down there

32:06.794 --> 32:08.970
and I was pushing
myself back into him

32:09.014 --> 32:13.061
and it was the most crazy,
exciting feeling I'd ever had

32:13.105 --> 32:16.195
and... and, um,
then a car started up

32:16.847 --> 32:19.502
and the headlamps came on

32:19.546 --> 32:21.504
and he was startled
so he dashed away.

32:23.376 --> 32:25.204
And the next day we went home.

32:26.074 --> 32:28.250
And I wished we'd just stayed
one more day.

33:22.087 --> 33:23.914
Hello.
- Hello again.

33:27.179 --> 33:28.093
Thank you.

33:28.919 --> 33:31.009
This is a very nice surprise.

33:31.531 --> 33:32.923
Is it?

33:32.967 --> 33:34.577
It's the same room.
I mean, I booked the same room

33:34.621 --> 33:36.884
cos I didn't want to
be thrown by a new layout.

33:36.927 --> 33:38.973
Oh, no, I mean
you booking me again.

33:39.017 --> 33:40.888
Oh.
- I mean, you must've been
satisfied

33:40.931 --> 33:42.890
the last time, so
I'm happy about that.

33:42.933 --> 33:44.979
Yes, yes, I was satisfied. Yes.

33:46.111 --> 33:47.373
But?

33:47.416 --> 33:48.809
But?

33:48.852 --> 33:51.159
Oh, it sounded like there was
going to be a "but".

33:51.203 --> 33:53.248
No, no, not particularly.

33:53.292 --> 33:55.685
I, um, I've got a little bit
of feedback

33:55.729 --> 33:57.905
and a couple of attainment goals
for this time.

33:57.948 --> 33:59.820
Right, I see. Sure. OK.

34:00.429 --> 34:01.952
Would you like a drink?
- Yeah.

34:01.996 --> 34:03.215
That sounds great.

34:10.744 --> 34:12.137
- Cheers.

34:15.009 --> 34:18.056
So, I've made a list of things
that I'd like to get through.

34:18.099 --> 34:19.927
Oh, that sounds sexy.

34:19.970 --> 34:21.972
Don't mock me. I'm a teacher.

34:22.712 --> 34:24.062
Old habits die hard.

34:24.105 --> 34:25.411
What's first on the list?

34:30.720 --> 34:32.331
Number one:

34:32.374 --> 34:34.463
I perform oral sex on you.

34:34.507 --> 34:37.249
Number two: you
perform oral sex on me.

34:37.292 --> 34:39.599
Number three: we do a "69"

34:39.642 --> 34:41.296
if that's what
it's still called.

34:41.340 --> 34:42.471
Uh, I don't know.

34:42.515 --> 34:45.692
Um, four: me on top.
- doggy-style.

34:47.563 --> 34:49.913
Well, that all
sounds very achievable.

34:49.957 --> 34:51.306
Oh, does it? Oh, good.

34:51.828 --> 34:55.528
Good, cos I'm...
I have no frame of reference.

34:56.050 --> 34:59.271
I've tried, um, looking on the
internet, but it's alarming,
frankly.

34:59.314 --> 35:01.447
I mean, if you type
in "classy porn" to Google

35:01.490 --> 35:03.405
up pop 12 windows of erections.

35:03.449 --> 35:06.060
I mean, there's no build-up at
all. Have I booked enough time?

35:06.887 --> 35:08.367
You want to do it all today?

35:08.802 --> 35:09.977
Yes, if possible.

35:10.020 --> 35:12.110
I mean, it's just,
you're quite expensive

35:12.153 --> 35:15.200
and I'm not sure if I'll be able
to afford another session
after this.

35:15.591 --> 35:16.897
OK.

35:16.940 --> 35:18.246
OK.

35:18.290 --> 35:19.813
I understand, um...

35:21.467 --> 35:23.904
Isn't there something else
that should be on that list?

35:24.687 --> 35:26.385
Like what?

35:26.428 --> 35:29.388
Well, I'd love for you to feel
completely satisfied...

35:29.431 --> 35:30.563
if at all possible.

35:32.304 --> 35:33.479
Oh.

35:33.522 --> 35:34.828
Oh.

35:34.871 --> 35:36.569
- The big "o", in fact.

35:36.612 --> 35:37.961
Yes.

35:38.005 --> 35:41.443
No, I like a list that can be
fully ticked-off.

35:41.487 --> 35:44.229
Achievable goals.
That's the path to happiness,

35:44.272 --> 35:45.795
there's no point in wishing for
the moon.

35:45.839 --> 35:48.189
Well, it's an orgasm, you know,
it's not a Fabergé egg.

35:48.233 --> 35:49.712
People have them every day.

35:52.062 --> 35:55.370
Right. Do you know what, you're
right. That all makes sense.

35:55.892 --> 35:58.112
I just... I want to feel
a sense of achievement.

35:58.156 --> 35:59.940
Yes.
- I don't want to walk away...

36:00.549 --> 36:02.029
from this feeling unresolved.

36:04.162 --> 36:05.163
May I?

36:07.730 --> 36:08.862
Do you know what?

36:08.905 --> 36:10.951
We'll do as much of this
as we can today.

36:10.994 --> 36:13.519
I think we'll certainly make
a significant dent in it.

36:14.259 --> 36:15.216
Good.

36:15.260 --> 36:16.609
That's good. Good.

36:17.349 --> 36:19.046
You want to
start with the blow job?

36:20.395 --> 36:21.701
Yes, I think so.

36:22.441 --> 36:23.790
Get the big one
out the way first.

36:27.272 --> 36:28.447
Should I kneel?

36:29.274 --> 36:32.451
Well, I could stand on a chair,
but that's not how it's
usually done.

36:33.800 --> 36:34.975
Mm-hmm.

36:36.194 --> 36:37.978
You don't have
to do any of this.

36:38.021 --> 36:41.111
No, I know, I... but I want
to be a woman of the world.

36:41.155 --> 36:44.071
I mean, there are nuns out there
with more sexual
experience than me.

36:44.114 --> 36:46.029
It's embarrassing. Do
you want me to brush my teeth?

36:46.073 --> 36:50.338
What? No. Nancy, you can just...
you can just let go.

36:50.773 --> 36:52.949
Let go? What am
I letting go of, exactly?

36:52.993 --> 36:54.908
I mean, we need some
sort of plan, don't we?

36:54.951 --> 36:57.389
I don't want to swing from the
chandeliers and make loud
animal noises.

36:57.432 --> 36:58.651
I'd like to see that.

36:59.652 --> 37:02.959
You're letting go of the
thing inside that grips you.

37:03.003 --> 37:04.265
You know, that judges you.

37:04.309 --> 37:06.224
That watches
you from the outside.

37:06.789 --> 37:08.835
Christ, if I let go of that,
anything might happen.

37:08.878 --> 37:10.489
That's the only thing keeping
my life together.

37:10.532 --> 37:12.447
Keeping it
ticking along... Here?

37:12.491 --> 37:13.709
Over here.

37:14.232 --> 37:15.668
What am I just supposed to do?

37:15.711 --> 37:17.800
Just float around like
some sort of freeform jellyfish

37:17.844 --> 37:19.367
you know, waiting for something
to come up?

37:19.411 --> 37:21.151
No, but you're...
- Do I undo your belt?

37:21.195 --> 37:22.544
Do you undo it?
What's normal?

37:22.588 --> 37:24.242
Well, it's more a matter of...
- Well, I'll do it.

37:24.285 --> 37:25.547
OK.

37:25.591 --> 37:27.593
No, I just... I just want
to do a blow job.

37:27.636 --> 37:30.422
I want to get that sorted
and then we can work through
as much of the rest

37:30.465 --> 37:33.120
of the list as we can
in the allotted time.
- Like we've got a double lesson

37:33.163 --> 37:36.645
timetabled for oral, and then we
can see what's left of the
afternoon?

37:36.689 --> 37:38.299
Exactly.
- And shall I ring a bell

37:38.343 --> 37:39.692
at the end of the session?

37:39.735 --> 37:41.215
Do you use a bell?
You didn't last time.

37:43.043 --> 37:44.044
Oh.

37:44.958 --> 37:46.742
Very funny.

37:54.446 --> 37:55.534
Um...

37:56.404 --> 37:57.405
Oh...

37:57.449 --> 37:58.580
Sorry.

37:59.059 --> 38:00.930
I'll be back to all this
in just a second.

38:04.543 --> 38:06.196
Hi, darling. Hi.

38:51.894 --> 38:53.548
Sorry about that.
- Everything OK?

38:54.288 --> 38:57.987
Yes. My daughter. She's just in
a bit of a pickle at the moment,
shall we say.

38:58.031 --> 38:59.380
I'm sorry to hear that.

38:59.424 --> 39:01.382
Well, it's not the first time,
won't be the last.

39:01.426 --> 39:03.819
She used to ring her father
about all this, but anyway...

39:03.863 --> 39:06.692
Um, shall we just try
and get through what we can?

39:07.127 --> 39:09.303
Before the exam?
- Um, yes.

39:09.912 --> 39:11.044
Nancy.

39:16.484 --> 39:19.357
There is no exam.
It's all a dance.

39:19.879 --> 39:21.271
I don't know the steps.

39:21.315 --> 39:24.013
An improvised dance,
we just go where it takes us.

39:24.057 --> 39:26.320
There's no timetable,
there's no bell.

39:26.364 --> 39:27.974
But I've only
paid for two hours.

39:28.017 --> 39:30.368
Well, then let's enjoy them.
Every single minute.

39:30.411 --> 39:32.500
OK, come on then.

39:32.544 --> 39:35.590
Do you want to start with the
blow job or go with something
else on the list?

39:35.634 --> 39:37.636
No, I think I'd like
to go in order.

39:37.679 --> 39:39.899
I feel like I'm prepared
for the blow job now.

39:39.942 --> 39:43.903
Robert, my husband, he never...
he never wanted to try
anything new.

39:44.686 --> 39:47.733
He planned everything, I mean,
even his own funeral, actually.

39:47.776 --> 39:49.691
I was terrified
he'd turn up on the day

39:49.735 --> 39:52.259
and tell me I'd put the
wrong ham in the sandwiches.

39:53.608 --> 39:54.870
It wasn't a...

39:56.394 --> 39:58.657
furnace of
passion that burnt out

39:58.700 --> 40:01.094
our relationship,
it was more like, um...

40:02.487 --> 40:03.749
the bottom drawer of an AGA.

40:03.792 --> 40:04.967
A what?

40:05.011 --> 40:08.710
Um, it's an old-fashioned stove.

40:08.754 --> 40:10.973
You can't turn it off.

40:11.017 --> 40:13.193
It keeps on chugging away,
and at the bottom

40:13.236 --> 40:15.064
there's a kind of
cooler drawer thing

40:15.108 --> 40:16.979
that you can push things
to the back of...

40:17.023 --> 40:18.764
Mm.
- ...you know, to cook them
slowly

40:18.807 --> 40:21.244
like a bowl of stewed apples
or something.

40:21.288 --> 40:22.594
I see.
- Do you?

40:22.637 --> 40:24.117
Er, not really.

40:24.160 --> 40:27.381
But, um, I think you mean
your marriage stewed slowly

40:27.425 --> 40:29.165
because you
pushed it to the back.

40:29.209 --> 40:30.384
And then forgot about it.

40:31.037 --> 40:32.734
Mm.
- Mm.

40:32.778 --> 40:34.649
Well, anyway.
He's gone, it's all gone.

40:34.693 --> 40:35.824
Ancient history.

40:37.086 --> 40:39.524
And I want to try something new.

40:40.873 --> 40:42.222
Then, good.

40:42.265 --> 40:44.746
So, I need to get that blow job
under my belt.

40:44.790 --> 40:46.182
Your belt, obviously.

40:46.226 --> 40:47.314
OK.

40:51.144 --> 40:52.188
OK?

40:53.712 --> 40:55.627
OK, OK, look.

40:55.670 --> 40:58.064
I have an idea.

40:58.717 --> 41:00.022
You like dancing, right?

41:00.762 --> 41:02.242
Only when nobody's watching.

41:02.285 --> 41:04.636
OK, well then we're gonna
change the mood.

41:04.679 --> 41:06.551
I'm gonna put on some music

41:06.986 --> 41:09.858
and you're gonna dance
like nobody is watching.

41:27.223 --> 41:29.182
Come on, Nancy Stokes.

41:29.225 --> 41:30.705

Oh, God, God.

43:29.650 --> 43:30.956
That'll be my daughter again.

43:31.739 --> 43:33.088
She always rings twice.

43:33.872 --> 43:37.005
She always forgets the most
crucial bit of information and
has to ring back.

43:37.397 --> 43:39.312
OK.
- I don't want to answer it.

43:39.355 --> 43:41.270
Then don't.
- But I always answer it.

43:41.314 --> 43:42.707
Even when you don't want to?

43:42.750 --> 43:44.665
Yeah, especially
when I don't want to.
- OK.

43:44.709 --> 43:46.798
Well, what am I gonna say?

43:46.841 --> 43:49.148
"Hello darling, I'm sorry I
can't talk now cos I've booked
this man for the night

43:49.191 --> 43:52.107
and I'm trying to work up the
courage to perform oral sex
on him".

43:52.151 --> 43:54.327
Well, you don't
have to say that.

43:54.806 --> 43:56.242
Shall I answer it?

43:56.285 --> 43:58.026
"Hello, darling.

43:58.070 --> 44:00.115
I'm sorry but your mother has
something in her mouth
right now."

44:00.159 --> 44:01.508
Shh!
- "I could take your message

44:01.551 --> 44:02.640
if you would like."

44:05.555 --> 44:07.209
Listen, darling, I...

44:10.604 --> 44:13.476
Yes. Oh, did he? Oh, God. Yes.

44:15.000 --> 44:16.262
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

44:17.611 --> 44:19.744
Oh, I am so sorry,
yes, I do understand.

44:21.571 --> 44:22.616
Mm-hmm.

44:23.748 --> 44:24.792
Yeah.

44:27.186 --> 44:29.797
Listen, darling, I really do...

44:29.841 --> 44:30.798
Pamela?

44:31.886 --> 44:33.235
Pamela?

44:33.279 --> 44:34.323
Oh, she's gone.

44:34.976 --> 44:37.022
Just like that? No goodbye?

44:37.065 --> 44:39.894
Well, either her battery ran out
or she's been abducted.

44:40.547 --> 44:42.375
Is it serious? Her pickle?

44:42.418 --> 44:44.551
Well, it can be sorted,
that's the main thing.

44:44.594 --> 44:46.161
I see.

44:46.205 --> 44:49.295
Matthew will provide the
grandchildren, I've no doubt
of that.

44:50.078 --> 44:52.602
If Pamela can just keep
herself alive, I'll be happy.

44:53.429 --> 44:55.083
You don't sound very happy.

44:55.736 --> 44:57.869
Well, it's very stressful being
a parent, Leo.

44:57.912 --> 44:59.740
It's a stress
that never leaves you

44:59.784 --> 45:01.568
it's... it's like
a thumb on a bruise.

45:01.611 --> 45:04.658
Sometimes my children feel like
a dead weight around my neck.

45:05.441 --> 45:07.705
I'm not sure I'd have done it
if I'd known.

45:08.270 --> 45:09.358
What do you mean?

45:10.620 --> 45:13.406
I mean, I could've done many
other things, if I hadn't been
a mother.

45:14.581 --> 45:16.888
What else would you have done?
- I dunno.

45:17.802 --> 45:19.151
Crossed the desert on a horse...

45:19.629 --> 45:22.894
started an artists' colony
on a hot little island...

45:22.937 --> 45:24.504
had a... had an orgasm...

45:26.680 --> 45:29.814
Would you find a massage
patronising at this point?

45:30.771 --> 45:33.861
No. No, I wouldn't.

45:46.656 --> 45:48.441
Do you think your
kids could feel it?

45:49.790 --> 45:51.444
Your disappointment in them?

45:52.706 --> 45:55.274
I don't know Leo. I doubt it.

45:55.709 --> 45:57.885
They mostly
didn't notice me, I think.

45:58.973 --> 46:01.846
I mean, do you notice
when your mother's disappointed?

46:05.414 --> 46:08.678
Are you worried that she'd be
disappointed if she knew
what you do?

46:10.158 --> 46:11.681
I'm not sure what you mean.

46:11.725 --> 46:13.945
There's nothing disappointing
about an oil rig, ma'am.

46:16.686 --> 46:18.384
Anyway, there's
still time for you.

46:19.385 --> 46:21.387
Oh, that's
sweet, but there isn't.

46:22.344 --> 46:23.737
This is it.

46:24.607 --> 46:26.653
My final attempt at a life.

46:27.523 --> 46:29.308
For the orgasm, I mean.

46:29.874 --> 46:32.659
You might have to abandon riding
a horse across the desert.

46:53.027 --> 46:55.203
Can I ask you to
do something for me?

46:55.725 --> 46:56.814
Mm-hmm.

46:59.294 --> 47:02.036
Would you mind
taking your shirt off?

47:03.037 --> 47:04.822
Sure. OK.

47:29.411 --> 47:30.848
Can I touch you, for a moment?

47:34.764 --> 47:35.809
You're just so...

47:40.422 --> 47:41.641
I never thought I...

47:48.953 --> 47:50.650
Can I touch your shoulders?

47:51.259 --> 47:52.304
Yes.

48:15.196 --> 48:16.371
And your arms?

48:17.285 --> 48:18.330
Yes.

48:33.780 --> 48:34.955
And your chest?

48:36.000 --> 48:37.001
Yes.

48:52.581 --> 48:54.975
Oh. Put that back on then.

48:55.628 --> 48:57.238
You want me to put it back on?

48:57.891 --> 48:59.632
Yes, if you want to.

48:59.675 --> 49:01.895
I thought things were
progressing quite nicely.

49:01.939 --> 49:03.288
I was suddenly overwhelmed.

49:03.853 --> 49:04.898
By what?

49:05.681 --> 49:08.119
Some wave, something of...

49:08.162 --> 49:09.511
Lust.

49:09.555 --> 49:12.384
Maybe. Sorry, I just feel
a bit sick, actually.

49:12.427 --> 49:14.212
Tiny bit faint.
- Put your head between your
legs.

49:14.255 --> 49:15.691
I can do that on my own time.

49:15.735 --> 49:18.607
I'll just, just, um... maybe
step away for a moment.

49:19.086 --> 49:20.435
Catch my breath.

49:21.567 --> 49:22.698
Have a drink.

49:30.576 --> 49:34.275
It's just, I, er... I've never
felt anyone like you before.

49:35.059 --> 49:37.931
Like me?
- Yeah, muscular, fit.
Like a model.

49:38.584 --> 49:39.759
I work out.

49:40.238 --> 49:42.805
I'm sure you do.
- I work hard.

49:43.458 --> 49:45.547
Don't you ever feel sometimes
it's a bit shallow?

49:48.333 --> 49:50.857
Yes. But my
clients like it, you know.

49:50.900 --> 49:52.554
And I like being wanted by them.

49:54.121 --> 49:57.646
When I'm here with you, being
looked at by you, I feel good.

49:57.690 --> 49:59.605
God, I can barely imagine that.

50:03.913 --> 50:05.393
Come here and stand with me.

50:25.761 --> 50:29.983
I've always been ashamed
of myself. My body, I mean.

50:30.549 --> 50:31.898
Always?
- Mm.

50:31.941 --> 50:33.813
Always been aware of
what's wrong with it.

50:34.335 --> 50:36.772
You know, stubby
thighs, fat tummy...

50:38.774 --> 50:41.255
boobs come down to my naval now,
my arms wobble...

50:41.299 --> 50:43.257
they have done
since I was 20, actually...

50:43.953 --> 50:46.086
and if I didn't pluck here
and here

50:46.826 --> 50:48.654
I could join a
circus after a month.

50:50.003 --> 50:51.613
Oh, I've plucked it.
- Mm.

50:53.137 --> 50:55.139
Don't be fooled
by the muscles, Nancy.

50:55.965 --> 50:57.750
I sometimes feel ashamed too.

50:57.793 --> 50:59.012
That's hard to imagine.

50:59.926 --> 51:01.406
Well, if I didn't look like this

51:01.449 --> 51:03.669
you might not have chosen me,
or wanted me.

51:08.282 --> 51:09.501
Can I unbutton this?

51:09.892 --> 51:10.980
Yes.

51:20.729 --> 51:22.296
Can I take this off?
- Mm-hmm.

51:42.795 --> 51:44.144
Your body is beautiful.

51:44.710 --> 51:46.015
I wish you could see that.

51:52.674 --> 51:54.589
I have always
quite liked my calves.

51:56.417 --> 51:57.984
They're not completely awful.

51:59.464 --> 52:00.856
I can hear my mother...

52:00.900 --> 52:02.336
"Vanity is a weakness, dear."

52:02.380 --> 52:04.033
It's not vain
to enjoy your body.

52:04.077 --> 52:05.122
To love it.

52:05.992 --> 52:08.734
But I know that voice in your
head, the one that talks
shit at you.

52:09.213 --> 52:10.344
I have one too.

52:11.128 --> 52:12.346
It gets tiring...

52:13.869 --> 52:15.088
so boring.

52:15.958 --> 52:17.395
Oh, I'm sorry to bore you.

52:17.438 --> 52:19.571
You're not...
You're not boring me, Nancy.

52:20.876 --> 52:23.009
Hm... Is Leo Grande
your real name?

52:25.707 --> 52:26.752
No.

52:33.498 --> 52:35.369
Is Nancy Stokes your real name?

52:37.328 --> 52:38.329
No.

52:45.379 --> 52:46.946
Do you know, sometimes I wonder

52:46.989 --> 52:49.557
whether what you young men need
is a war.

52:50.732 --> 52:51.777
Excuse me?

52:51.820 --> 52:53.605
Well, you're all
just so fit and...

52:53.996 --> 52:57.043
bursting with energy and
killing pretend soldiers on your
computers

52:57.086 --> 52:59.350
but actually, underneath it all,
you're really quite anxious

52:59.393 --> 53:01.265
and not quite
sure of yourselves.

53:01.308 --> 53:03.310
Perhaps that's what
every generation needs.

53:03.354 --> 53:06.052
A war. It's self-correcting.
It makes us all nicer.

53:06.095 --> 53:09.055
My generation of men, they
never had a chance to prove
themselves.

53:09.098 --> 53:11.318
I mean, I think they felt
actually inadequate in front of
their fathers.

53:11.362 --> 53:12.885
And I think it's caused
a whole lot of bother

53:12.928 --> 53:14.974
and I'm worried your
lot are gonna be even worse.

53:15.017 --> 53:16.584
My brother's in the army.

53:16.628 --> 53:19.457
Is he? Oh, sorry.
I didn't mean to imply...

53:20.675 --> 53:22.068
Is he older or younger?

53:22.111 --> 53:23.635
He's younger. He's 24.

53:24.462 --> 53:25.811
Huh. Which bit of the army?

53:25.854 --> 53:26.768
Artillery.

53:26.812 --> 53:28.335
Mm, oh, the big guns.

53:29.031 --> 53:30.903
Yeah, well,
might as well go all in.

53:30.946 --> 53:33.166
If I was in the army,
I'd want big guns too.

53:33.993 --> 53:35.734
Do you see him?
- Not much.

53:36.691 --> 53:38.084
Miss him?

53:38.127 --> 53:39.303
Of course.

53:40.042 --> 53:41.348
I love him.

53:42.741 --> 53:45.091
And he doesn't...
He doesn't know about all this?

53:45.134 --> 53:46.005
No.

53:47.006 --> 53:48.007
No.

53:48.660 --> 53:50.314
He thinks I work at the oil rig.

53:51.010 --> 53:52.272
Uh-huh.

53:52.316 --> 53:54.274
Not sure he believes it.

53:54.318 --> 53:56.102
So, you're not close?

53:57.799 --> 53:58.931
Can I top you up?

54:00.454 --> 54:02.108
Yes... please.

54:06.678 --> 54:07.809
Thank you.

54:10.856 --> 54:14.294
Not for me.
Or I won't enjoy myself as much.

54:29.440 --> 54:30.919
You wanna play a game?

54:31.572 --> 54:33.095
Like roleplay.

54:33.139 --> 54:35.794
We could work the blow job
into the game, it might help.

54:36.534 --> 54:39.101
How about teacher and student?

54:39.798 --> 54:41.103
We could have an RE lesson.

54:41.147 --> 54:42.714
Like the Garden of Eden...

54:43.584 --> 54:44.716
the fall of man...

54:45.978 --> 54:47.284
Come on, Miss.

54:47.327 --> 54:49.286
Teach me about original sin.

54:55.204 --> 54:57.119
You know,
I've been very bad today, Miss.

54:57.163 --> 54:59.644
You might have to keep me behind
after class.

54:59.687 --> 55:02.560
You have to stop wearing
those tight skirts because I...

55:02.603 --> 55:04.562
I can't concentrate on my Bible.

55:04.605 --> 55:06.825
And, er, when you lean down
over my desk

55:06.868 --> 55:08.392
I can see right
down your blouse.

55:08.827 --> 55:09.915
And last night in my bed, I--

55:09.958 --> 55:11.482
OK, stop it.
- But, Miss...

55:11.525 --> 55:13.484
No, we shouldn't be doing this.
- No, I know, Miss, but...

55:13.527 --> 55:15.660
No, no! Safe word,
safe word, safe word.

55:15.703 --> 55:17.444
What?
- Safe word.

55:18.010 --> 55:19.403
We don't have a safe word.

55:19.446 --> 55:21.100
I didn't think we'd need one.

55:21.143 --> 55:23.363
Oh, It's OK, we can stop.
Look, I've stopped.

55:23.407 --> 55:26.410
I'm just not into
all that, OK? My God.

55:26.453 --> 55:27.976
OK, sorry. I didn't mean to...

55:28.020 --> 55:29.630
I-I know what this looks like.

55:29.674 --> 55:32.372
But it's just not the point.
I don't want to dominate you.

55:32.416 --> 55:34.331
I don't want to teach you.
- It's only play.

55:34.374 --> 55:36.333
Yes, I know, but I don't want
to play at that.

55:36.376 --> 55:39.379
I want to play at something
else. I want to play at
feeling young again.

55:40.249 --> 55:42.687
I want that feeling back.
That feeling of...

55:42.730 --> 55:44.428
having it all before me.

55:44.906 --> 55:46.255
You want to be 16 again?

55:46.299 --> 55:47.909
No, I don't want to be 16 again.

55:47.953 --> 55:49.694
Being 16's bloody awful.

55:49.737 --> 55:51.957
I want the
feeling of being 16 again.

55:52.784 --> 55:55.395
That power...
God, I didn't know I had it.

55:55.439 --> 55:56.875
It was wasted on me.

55:56.918 --> 55:59.573
But some
of the girls I taught...

55:59.617 --> 56:01.401
they knew what they were doing.

56:01.445 --> 56:02.881
With the men, I mean.

56:02.924 --> 56:03.969
What do you mean?

56:04.535 --> 56:06.319
I tried to tell them, the girls

56:06.363 --> 56:09.322
but the skirts just kept
on going up and up and up and up

56:09.366 --> 56:12.717
until you could practically see
how clean their back teeth were.

56:13.979 --> 56:15.546
They just didn't care.

56:15.937 --> 56:19.114
Why should they? They can wear
what they want, surely.

56:19.158 --> 56:22.204
Men can't always control
themselves, Leo.
They're not all like you.

56:22.248 --> 56:25.556
Some of those male teachers were
like lambs to the slaughter,
poor sods.

56:25.599 --> 56:27.340
Or maybe they
were in the wrong job.

56:27.993 --> 56:32.171
Or maybe they should have
realised those girls weren't
there for them.

56:36.654 --> 56:40.658
Have you ever been...
you know, in trouble?

56:42.529 --> 56:43.704
Been in trouble?

56:45.053 --> 56:48.100
Mm. I mean, isn't
selling sex illegal?

56:48.143 --> 56:51.277
No, soliciting
money for sex is illegal.

56:51.843 --> 56:54.019
I don't solicit
money for sex, Nancy.

56:54.759 --> 56:56.456
No, I sell my company.

56:56.978 --> 56:59.459
I provide
interesting conversation.

56:59.503 --> 57:03.115
I can dance, I can
make 20 different cocktails.

57:04.638 --> 57:06.988
Whether or not we have sex
is our business.

57:07.772 --> 57:09.469
There's nothing
illegal about that.

57:10.122 --> 57:11.602
I mean, as well as the blow jobs

57:11.645 --> 57:13.821
it's also quite nice
to get to know each other.

57:15.562 --> 57:17.434
Yes, I suppose so.

57:18.173 --> 57:20.611
That's why I tend to recommend
more sessions.

57:21.742 --> 57:22.961
Sorry?

57:23.004 --> 57:25.050
It makes it more
satisfying, you know?

57:25.659 --> 57:27.792
I'm actually looking
for more regular clients--

57:27.835 --> 57:29.010
Oh, I see.
- What?

57:29.663 --> 57:31.883
I see where this is going.
- It's not "going" anywhere.

57:31.926 --> 57:33.580
Here it comes. The hard sell.

57:33.624 --> 57:36.322
Is it like driving lessons?
Do I get 10 for the price of 9

57:36.365 --> 57:38.803
if I book in advance with
the Leo Grande School of Sex?

57:38.846 --> 57:40.805
I don't know what other
kind of clients you have, Leo

57:40.848 --> 57:42.067
but I am not a rich woman.

57:42.110 --> 57:43.721
No, I know but...
- And so, you know

57:43.764 --> 57:45.810
I'd like to wind up
the sales chat before my time

57:45.853 --> 57:48.160
and money and
patience run out, so...

57:48.203 --> 57:51.076
please, Leo Grande,
or whatever your name is

57:51.119 --> 57:53.992
just give me my bloody blow job
and we can all go home.

58:08.876 --> 58:10.399
Why don't I sit on the edge here

58:10.443 --> 58:12.532
and you could kneel on a cushion
in front of me?

58:12.576 --> 58:13.838
How about that?

58:13.881 --> 58:16.449
OK. If that's... optimal.

58:30.637 --> 58:33.510
Do I just... get it out?

58:33.945 --> 58:35.120
That's right.

58:46.740 --> 58:49.003
Oh, it's pathetic. I'm pathetic.

58:49.438 --> 58:51.963
That list
was such a stupid idea.

58:52.616 --> 58:55.357
You know, you don't have to
do any of this. At all.

58:56.141 --> 58:57.882
I'm scared. That's the truth.

58:58.970 --> 59:00.145
Of what?

59:01.059 --> 59:03.714
That I won't like it.
That you won't like it.

59:05.280 --> 59:06.455
Maybe you won't.

59:07.195 --> 59:08.936
But you can try and see.

59:10.242 --> 59:11.286
It's no harm.

59:12.157 --> 59:14.115
Unless you're gonna bite it off.

59:14.159 --> 59:16.422
In which case I
probably won't like it.

59:25.953 --> 59:28.565
Nancy, everyone
needs something different.

59:29.914 --> 59:31.480
Maybe you just want to talk?

59:35.093 --> 59:37.922
You know, I have a
regular client who just likes to

59:38.313 --> 59:40.402
hold hands and
watch TV together.

59:48.497 --> 59:50.804
I mean, don't get me wrong,
I also have a client

59:50.848 --> 59:52.893
who likes me to walk in
without a word

59:53.372 --> 59:56.201
have sex with her as quickly
and silently as I can

59:56.593 --> 59:57.811
and then leave.

59:59.726 --> 1:00:03.425
I actually quite like that
one because it only
takes ten minutes

1:00:03.469 --> 1:00:04.949
but she pays for the full hour.

1:00:08.256 --> 1:00:11.433
And there's a guy who wants me
to dress up as a cat

1:00:11.477 --> 1:00:13.435
and then ignore him for an hour
and go home.

1:00:15.089 --> 1:00:16.787
What, and have no sex?
- No.

1:00:21.052 --> 1:00:24.011
I think you'd make a
very good cat, for what's worth.

1:00:24.882 --> 1:00:25.970
Thank you.

1:00:27.711 --> 1:00:30.365
What I'm trying to say is,
I don't judge my clients.

1:00:31.192 --> 1:00:32.367
You know?

1:00:32.411 --> 1:00:34.065
Unless they're total arseholes.

1:00:35.588 --> 1:00:37.721
And you're definitely not
a total arsehole.

1:00:39.505 --> 1:00:41.463
Well, that's nice to hear.

1:00:44.510 --> 1:00:46.207
I have a client who can't walk.

1:00:47.905 --> 1:00:49.036
And I bathe her.

1:00:50.168 --> 1:00:52.736
But what she really wants
is dirty talk while I do it.

1:00:54.433 --> 1:00:56.000
And then I join
her in the water.

1:00:59.046 --> 1:01:00.308
It's what she wants.

1:01:01.222 --> 1:01:03.442
Hmm.
- Everyone wants something
different.

1:01:03.921 --> 1:01:06.271
You sound like
some sort of sex saint.

1:01:08.534 --> 1:01:09.883
Are you real?

1:01:10.710 --> 1:01:13.626
Oh no, I really fancy her.

1:01:14.409 --> 1:01:15.628
It's quite hot.

1:01:16.585 --> 1:01:18.065
And I look forward to it.

1:01:18.849 --> 1:01:20.154
It's what she needs.

1:01:21.982 --> 1:01:25.029
You make it sound like it should
be available from the
local council.

1:01:25.072 --> 1:01:26.421
Like a public service.

1:01:27.118 --> 1:01:30.208
Mm. Can you imagine how much
less bullshit there would be?

1:01:30.251 --> 1:01:32.036
As long as they
don't put the rates up

1:01:32.079 --> 1:01:33.907
cos people are furious enough
about that.

1:01:33.951 --> 1:01:35.822
They'll still collect the bins.

1:01:38.477 --> 1:01:40.740
It's different for women,
though, in your line
of work, isn't it?

1:01:40.784 --> 1:01:42.481
More dangerous.
- It can be.

1:01:44.004 --> 1:01:47.268
Well, I've been called some
choice names and been
slapped about a bit.

1:01:47.312 --> 1:01:48.574
Oh, my God.

1:01:48.617 --> 1:01:52.839
Oh, come on.
You know that. You do.

1:01:54.928 --> 1:01:56.538
Yeah, you know

1:01:56.582 --> 1:02:00.804
I used to set this exact essay
question in my ethics lessons.

1:02:01.282 --> 1:02:03.023
"Should sex work be made legal?"

1:02:03.067 --> 1:02:06.200
And every year, 30 essays
came back, all exactly the same.

1:02:06.853 --> 1:02:08.376
What did they say?

1:02:08.420 --> 1:02:11.858
Uh, that although the moral
issues remain up for debate

1:02:12.380 --> 1:02:15.383
the legalisation of sex work
would ultimately provide
protection

1:02:15.427 --> 1:02:19.126
for sex workers and help
eradicate trafficking and abuse.

1:02:20.171 --> 1:02:21.694
Sounds like Wikipedia.

1:02:21.738 --> 1:02:24.175
It is Wikipedia. They all
copied it out, word for word.

1:02:24.218 --> 1:02:26.568
Every year. Except this one boy

1:02:26.612 --> 1:02:28.048
Lucas White

1:02:28.092 --> 1:02:29.658
who wrote, um...

1:02:29.702 --> 1:02:31.356
"Sex work should be made legal

1:02:31.399 --> 1:02:33.314
so your mum pays
tax on her earnings."

1:02:33.358 --> 1:02:35.229
Which did provide
a bit of light relief

1:02:35.273 --> 1:02:36.753
if I'm honest.

1:02:37.275 --> 1:02:38.276
Oh...

1:02:41.583 --> 1:02:42.759
I think it's...

1:02:43.977 --> 1:02:46.153
much bigger than that,
the whole idea.

1:02:47.415 --> 1:02:49.591
Just think how civilised
it could be

1:02:50.505 --> 1:02:52.159
if it was just available to all

1:02:52.203 --> 1:02:54.466
there's no shame attached,
there's no judgement.

1:02:57.034 --> 1:03:01.299
You want sex, and you're
frustrated you can't get it for
whatever reason.

1:03:01.342 --> 1:03:04.432
You're shy, you're unwell,
you're grieving

1:03:04.476 --> 1:03:07.566
you're physically struggling...
so you just hire someone

1:03:08.175 --> 1:03:09.307
like me.

1:03:10.351 --> 1:03:12.440
It's all regulated and safe.

1:03:12.484 --> 1:03:15.313
For you, for me,
better for everyone.

1:03:17.271 --> 1:03:18.577
And I help you...

1:03:20.448 --> 1:03:21.710
Or I pleasure you.

1:03:22.711 --> 1:03:23.887
Even better.

1:03:26.324 --> 1:03:29.675
The... thing is, lots of people
like the secrecy.

1:03:30.241 --> 1:03:33.592
They get off on it,
or they just want the fantasy.

1:03:34.245 --> 1:03:35.942
And that's totally fine

1:03:35.986 --> 1:03:40.077
but... I quite like the reality

1:03:41.121 --> 1:03:43.428
and it's my actual job, so...

1:03:46.997 --> 1:03:50.174
You know, one thing I love,
Nancy, is just to watch
someone's face

1:03:50.217 --> 1:03:51.566
when they feel pleasure.

1:03:52.741 --> 1:03:56.354
When they let go,
when they succumb

1:03:56.920 --> 1:03:59.531
when the body goes with it

1:03:59.574 --> 1:04:02.534
and that heat,
and that feeling...

1:04:05.754 --> 1:04:08.105
Everything just loosens.

1:04:10.324 --> 1:04:11.456
It's...

1:04:13.806 --> 1:04:16.113
It's just so, so great.

1:04:20.160 --> 1:04:21.161
Mm.

1:04:24.817 --> 1:04:25.687
Oh!

1:04:28.516 --> 1:04:30.127
You do like it.

1:04:33.608 --> 1:04:37.134
Thank you for
telling me that, Leo.

1:04:37.961 --> 1:04:40.746
I mean, not only because
it was very interesting

1:04:41.225 --> 1:04:42.661
and enlightening...

1:04:46.273 --> 1:04:47.753
But also...

1:04:48.493 --> 1:04:49.668
do you mind if...

1:04:50.974 --> 1:04:52.018
Go for it.

1:05:28.925 --> 1:05:29.969
Mm.

1:05:34.060 --> 1:05:35.018
Mm!

1:05:37.150 --> 1:05:38.238
[SHE SIGHS

1:05:38.978 --> 1:05:40.719
That was a surprise.

1:05:42.677 --> 1:05:44.070
A good surprise?

1:05:44.114 --> 1:05:46.986
Yes, very good.
I wasn't sure about it.

1:05:47.030 --> 1:05:49.075
You know, whether I'd like it,
but it's...

1:05:49.467 --> 1:05:51.338
like bathing in a warm sea.

1:05:51.773 --> 1:05:54.124
I may have dropped off
for a moment, actually. Sorry.

1:05:54.167 --> 1:05:55.734
It's no problem.

1:05:56.561 --> 1:06:00.434
But also no...
- No, no orgasm, no.

1:06:03.089 --> 1:06:04.961
I wonder what noise I'd make.

1:06:06.353 --> 1:06:09.704
Apparently
sneezing's a very good sign

1:06:09.748 --> 1:06:12.055
of how loud
a person is when they orgasm.

1:06:12.577 --> 1:06:13.621
Really?
- Yeah.

1:06:13.665 --> 1:06:16.015
My mother sneezes very loudly.

1:06:16.059 --> 1:06:17.669
But some people sneeze
like cats.

1:06:17.712 --> 1:06:19.279
You know...

1:06:19.323 --> 1:06:22.848
I... I can never rid myself
of the notion

1:06:22.891 --> 1:06:25.155
that they must orgasm
like cats too.

1:06:25.198 --> 1:06:26.808
If cats orgasm.
I don't know, do they?

1:06:26.852 --> 1:06:27.896
Nobody knows.

1:06:29.289 --> 1:06:33.337
How did you fake it, with your
husband? What noise
did you make?

1:06:33.380 --> 1:06:34.642
Um, oh, God...

1:06:36.209 --> 1:06:38.516
Wait. I've got to think...

1:06:38.559 --> 1:06:40.083
think it through, um...

1:06:45.871 --> 1:06:47.568
Hm-hm-hm-hm.

1:06:54.401 --> 1:06:56.360
That was very convincing.

1:06:56.403 --> 1:06:59.363
Anyway... that's number two

1:06:59.406 --> 1:07:01.234
ticked off the bucket list.

1:07:01.278 --> 1:07:02.714
Or "licked off
the fuck-it list".

1:07:02.757 --> 1:07:05.804
Quite. And I'm
very happy about that.

1:07:05.847 --> 1:07:08.763
You are very good at
this whole business, you know.

1:07:09.242 --> 1:07:11.897
I hope you know.
People should tell you.

1:07:11.940 --> 1:07:14.552
Thank you.
That's nice to hear.

1:07:14.595 --> 1:07:17.250
It's a sort of
mysterious gift you have.

1:07:17.294 --> 1:07:20.123
It's not so mysterious.
I just make the effort.

1:07:21.124 --> 1:07:23.604
And I like you, so it's easy.

1:07:23.648 --> 1:07:25.824
See, see? You always know
the right thing to say

1:07:25.867 --> 1:07:27.695
when to make the
move and all that.

1:07:27.739 --> 1:07:29.045
You learn to read people.

1:07:30.872 --> 1:07:32.135
I'm not sure I ever have.

1:07:32.178 --> 1:07:33.745
You have to want to first.

1:07:35.051 --> 1:07:38.663
Yeah, I probably don't want
to enough to put in the work.

1:07:40.143 --> 1:07:41.753
I just pay attention.

1:07:42.667 --> 1:07:45.713
And what about you? Is there
someone who pays
attention to you?

1:07:46.279 --> 1:07:49.065
You know, is there someone?
- Someone?

1:07:49.456 --> 1:07:52.024
Yes, you know, a special person,
a particular person.

1:07:52.894 --> 1:07:54.244
What, other than you?

1:07:54.287 --> 1:07:57.725
Oh, stop it. I mean a
girlfriend, or boyfriend

1:07:57.769 --> 1:08:01.425
or, you know, one of those
fluid arrangements you have
these days.

1:08:01.468 --> 1:08:02.948
Nancy.
- Leo.

1:08:02.991 --> 1:08:06.908
It's all about this moment,
in this room, right now.

1:08:06.952 --> 1:08:07.996
It's all about you.

1:08:08.432 --> 1:08:10.869
Forget everything else.
That's the whole point.

1:08:12.000 --> 1:08:13.611
Yes, but who are you in there?

1:08:15.308 --> 1:08:17.876
Who are you out there?
That's what I want to know.

1:08:18.703 --> 1:08:21.271
Now I've rebooked you.
- And I'm very glad you did.

1:08:21.314 --> 1:08:24.752
And I am too, but I just thought
maybe we could personalise
it a bit.

1:08:24.796 --> 1:08:27.190
If it's gonna
be a regular thing.

1:08:27.973 --> 1:08:30.149
I thought you were happy
with what I'm doing.

1:08:30.193 --> 1:08:33.109
Oh my goodness,
believe me, I am.

1:08:33.152 --> 1:08:36.590
My body is no longer the carcass
I've been heaving around for
thirty years.

1:08:36.634 --> 1:08:38.723
No, it's now a thing of wonder.

1:08:38.766 --> 1:08:40.638
"A playground of delight",
as you say.

1:08:41.160 --> 1:08:42.379
Did I say that?

1:08:42.944 --> 1:08:45.382
Mm, perhaps not.
But what about you?

1:08:46.513 --> 1:08:47.819
The real you?

1:08:49.037 --> 1:08:52.040
I'm whatever
you want me to be...

1:08:53.477 --> 1:08:54.826
here, in this moment.

1:08:56.262 --> 1:08:59.700
Hmm, but what if I want to know
who you are without me?

1:09:00.397 --> 1:09:02.225
When I'm not there.

1:09:03.051 --> 1:09:04.401
Wouldn't that be OK too?

1:09:06.098 --> 1:09:08.927
Nancy, I hope I've given you
what I said I would give you.

1:09:08.970 --> 1:09:10.755
You said we should
get to know each other.

1:09:10.798 --> 1:09:11.843
Nancy.

1:09:13.584 --> 1:09:15.107
So you're not going to tell me.

1:09:15.760 --> 1:09:18.241
Hey, have you ever considered
using sex toys?

1:09:18.719 --> 1:09:20.678
You know,
I actually brought some with me

1:09:20.721 --> 1:09:22.897
because some people find it
much easier...
- Actually, in that case

1:09:22.941 --> 1:09:24.421
I've got something to tell you.

1:09:24.899 --> 1:09:26.988
Oh, yeah?
- Yes.

1:09:28.773 --> 1:09:30.427
Well, go on then.

1:09:30.470 --> 1:09:32.690
Well, you know, if you're not
gonna tell me anything yourself

1:09:33.256 --> 1:09:34.692
long nights alone...

1:09:35.693 --> 1:09:37.608
one's curiosity
gets the better of one...

1:09:38.478 --> 1:09:40.437
Does it now?
- Yes. It does.

1:09:41.916 --> 1:09:43.831
I know who you are.

1:09:45.398 --> 1:09:47.052
Sorry?

1:09:47.095 --> 1:09:49.837
I know who you are.
I found out who you are
in real life.

1:09:50.447 --> 1:09:52.362
Don't know what you mean.
This is who I am.

1:09:52.405 --> 1:09:54.799
No, I mean your real name.
I found out your real name.

1:09:54.842 --> 1:09:56.888
I was gonna tell
you earlier, but...

1:09:56.931 --> 1:09:57.889
But...?

1:09:57.932 --> 1:09:59.717
But I thought it was best to...

1:09:59.760 --> 1:10:02.285
To... fuck first?

1:10:02.328 --> 1:10:05.375
Well, it was just a minor bit
of sleuthing on my part.

1:10:05.418 --> 1:10:07.159
You know, on my
credit card statement

1:10:07.203 --> 1:10:09.379
there's a company listed
to your website

1:10:09.422 --> 1:10:11.816
and you just go to
the company's house website

1:10:11.859 --> 1:10:14.253
and you can find the name
of the director of the company

1:10:14.297 --> 1:10:16.690
and that's how I found
out your name, you real name.

1:10:19.302 --> 1:10:20.564
Hang on.

1:10:20.607 --> 1:10:22.305
Hold on, what's going on?

1:10:24.176 --> 1:10:27.310
No, I'll... I'll tell
you my real name, if you like?

1:10:27.353 --> 1:10:29.573
I don't mind.
- No, thank you,
I'm not interested.

1:10:30.138 --> 1:10:31.923
Well, it's not so bad, is it?

1:10:32.489 --> 1:10:33.707
For me to know, I mean, it...

1:10:34.230 --> 1:10:35.927
It's not as if we're strangers.

1:10:35.970 --> 1:10:37.407
I have boundaries.

1:10:37.450 --> 1:10:39.583
I've asked you to respect them.
You haven't

1:10:39.626 --> 1:10:42.586
so I'll be going now. Please
don't attempt to book me again.

1:10:42.629 --> 1:10:43.935
Oh, come on now.

1:10:44.501 --> 1:10:48.156
Come on. It's not so bad.
I'll... I'll forget
I mentioned it.

1:10:48.200 --> 1:10:49.201
No.

1:10:49.245 --> 1:10:50.985
I'll still call you "Leo".

1:10:51.029 --> 1:10:53.423
You won't calling me anything
because I won't be here.

1:10:54.989 --> 1:10:56.121
OK, Connor.

1:10:57.470 --> 1:10:58.906
Don't you call me that.

1:10:59.559 --> 1:11:01.300
My name is Leo Grande.

1:11:01.344 --> 1:11:04.042
You booked Leo Grande,
and you got Leo Grande.

1:11:04.085 --> 1:11:06.740
And from what I could tell
by the moans and the sighs

1:11:06.784 --> 1:11:08.873
you have no complaints
with Leo Grande, am I right?

1:11:09.308 --> 1:11:10.309
Yes.
- Good.

1:11:10.353 --> 1:11:11.919
So we're clear on that.

1:11:11.963 --> 1:11:15.706
This is Leo Grande. I
made him, and I'm proud of him.

1:11:16.707 --> 1:11:18.752
And by the way, "Nancy Stokes"

1:11:18.796 --> 1:11:21.059
I could find out
who you are myself, you know.

1:11:21.929 --> 1:11:24.018
How do you think
people would react if they knew

1:11:24.062 --> 1:11:26.630
their ex-RE teacher was hiring
young men

1:11:26.673 --> 1:11:28.545
to lick their
pussy in a hotel room?

1:11:28.588 --> 1:11:30.634
What? Is that a
little too real for you?

1:11:30.677 --> 1:11:33.593
Cos that's just what we've just
been doing, so don't get
squeamish now.

1:11:33.637 --> 1:11:36.161
I honestly didn't think
you'd react like this.

1:11:36.204 --> 1:11:38.337
What?
- Well, I thought you'd be
pleased.

1:11:38.381 --> 1:11:39.817
Pleased?

1:11:39.860 --> 1:11:41.688
Well, I thought we'd
built up a trust, a real trust.

1:11:41.732 --> 1:11:43.560
I mean, I was ready
to tell you who I am.

1:11:43.603 --> 1:11:47.390
I thought we could maybe
continue outside of here, have
a coffee

1:11:47.999 --> 1:11:49.348
or a drink or something.

1:11:49.392 --> 1:11:50.523
Why can't we?

1:11:50.567 --> 1:11:52.569
Why can't we be friends?

1:11:52.612 --> 1:11:54.179
I mean, is it cos I'm old?

1:11:54.222 --> 1:11:56.442
Cos old ladies aren't allowed
to participate in anything

1:11:56.486 --> 1:11:58.314
where have to be kept quiet
and cosseted

1:11:58.357 --> 1:11:59.837
until... oh, until
you need our money

1:11:59.880 --> 1:12:01.186
and then you'll turn up
and do anything.

1:12:01.229 --> 1:12:03.536
Look, I know that's how it feels
with your kids

1:12:03.580 --> 1:12:06.365
but I have never treated you
or thought of you like an old...

1:12:06.409 --> 1:12:08.236
I thought you
were proud of your work.

1:12:08.280 --> 1:12:09.716
Why are you ashamed?

1:12:09.760 --> 1:12:11.501
I'm not ashamed.

1:12:11.544 --> 1:12:13.851
But you're lying about it,
you're hiding yourself, and
your work.

1:12:13.894 --> 1:12:15.853
Even from those closest to you.

1:12:15.896 --> 1:12:18.377
You're deluded.
You're crazy and deluded.

1:12:18.421 --> 1:12:20.684
Why can't your mother know
the truth if you're so proud?

1:12:20.727 --> 1:12:22.860
If you're not ashamed.
- You know there's a word for
this.

1:12:22.903 --> 1:12:25.471
It's called cyber-stalking.
And nutters do it.

1:12:25.863 --> 1:12:28.256
Crazy, sad, desperate
nutters like you.

1:12:28.300 --> 1:12:31.216
Oh, well, I am so sorry that
I had the audacity to find out

1:12:31.259 --> 1:12:34.524
the true identity of the man
I've been having sex with
for the past month.

1:12:34.567 --> 1:12:37.048
Why don't you tell me more
about your life on the oil rig?

1:12:37.091 --> 1:12:39.267
Why do you have to lie to me
about who you are?

1:12:39.311 --> 1:12:41.269
I am not lying to you, Nancy!

1:12:42.445 --> 1:12:44.316
This is my professional name.

1:12:44.360 --> 1:12:48.538
I provide a service, a
fantasy, and I told you
that very clearly.

1:12:48.581 --> 1:12:51.541
Well, all that stuff you said
about it being a vocation.

1:12:51.584 --> 1:12:52.933
Is that lies?
- No.

1:12:52.977 --> 1:12:55.588
She would be proud of
you, surely. She would.

1:12:57.285 --> 1:12:59.070
Why are we
talking about my mother?

1:12:59.113 --> 1:13:02.726
I could talk to her.
I was always very good with
the parents.

1:13:02.769 --> 1:13:05.119
I could explain it to her,
I could make her understand.

1:13:05.163 --> 1:13:06.251
No, thank you.

1:13:07.165 --> 1:13:09.689
I think it's important.
Let me do it.
- I don't need you to do that.

1:13:09.733 --> 1:13:12.170
Well, let me try.
I think it would be good for you

1:13:12.736 --> 1:13:14.215
for your life.

1:13:14.259 --> 1:13:16.914
Nobody is explaining
anything to my mother

1:13:16.957 --> 1:13:19.220
because far as she's concerned,
I'm dead.

1:13:21.092 --> 1:13:23.007
Sorry, what? What? What?
- Yeah.

1:13:23.050 --> 1:13:24.574
That's what she tells everyone.

1:13:26.402 --> 1:13:27.315
There.

1:13:27.707 --> 1:13:28.926
Do you feel sexy now?

1:13:29.883 --> 1:13:31.842
Feel like that's
what you're paying for?

1:13:33.365 --> 1:13:36.020
No, I didn't think so.

1:13:37.891 --> 1:13:42.156
Look, Nancy, I'm sorry that
your son is so immensely boring

1:13:42.200 --> 1:13:45.072
and that your daughter has
a more exciting life than you.

1:13:45.116 --> 1:13:47.988
You said your kids are like
a dead weight around your neck

1:13:48.032 --> 1:13:51.514
so let's not pretend you're
exactly "Mother of the Year"
yourself, right?

1:13:52.166 --> 1:13:57.215
But why would she want you dead?
Why? What did you do to her?

1:13:57.258 --> 1:13:59.522
Fuck off, Nancy.

1:14:19.803 --> 1:14:20.978
Alright.

1:14:23.023 --> 1:14:26.244
Don't talk to me,
I just forgot my phone.

1:14:39.213 --> 1:14:40.171
Fuck.

1:14:42.042 --> 1:14:43.174
Oh, fuck.

1:14:48.396 --> 1:14:49.528
Fuck.

1:14:55.403 --> 1:14:57.405
Leo, please. Please.
- Fuck!

1:14:59.016 --> 1:15:01.279
You wanna know if my
mother would be proud of me?

1:15:02.236 --> 1:15:03.455
Yeah, she disowned me.

1:15:04.195 --> 1:15:05.675
She left me to fend for myself.

1:15:06.719 --> 1:15:07.938
How old were you?

1:15:08.460 --> 1:15:09.505
I was 15.

1:15:10.375 --> 1:15:12.769
Why? Why did she disown you?
What did you do?

1:15:13.334 --> 1:15:14.597
What did I do?

1:15:15.467 --> 1:15:16.599
What did I do?

1:15:17.251 --> 1:15:19.776
I just disappointed
the fuck out of her.

1:15:27.914 --> 1:15:28.915
Hello?

1:15:30.090 --> 1:15:32.440
No, yes, no, no, no. It's fine.

1:15:32.484 --> 1:15:33.616
It's my friend, he, um...

1:15:34.312 --> 1:15:36.140
he fell,
actually, hurt his knee. Yes.

1:15:37.402 --> 1:15:39.622
Absolutely, no, of course.
We'll keep it down.

1:15:39.665 --> 1:15:41.537
Yes, yes, sorry. Thanks.

1:15:41.580 --> 1:15:42.407
Bye.

1:15:46.106 --> 1:15:48.021
You know, my
mother was like you.

1:15:49.632 --> 1:15:50.981
She did everything right.

1:15:51.547 --> 1:15:54.680
Food on the table, clean clothes
in the drawers, all that,
but um...

1:15:56.464 --> 1:15:59.990
I don't think she ever...
ever actually saw me.

1:16:04.647 --> 1:16:06.736
Or if she did,
she didn't like it.

1:16:09.303 --> 1:16:11.871
You know, she tried
to hide her repulsion

1:16:11.915 --> 1:16:13.830
but I could just feel it...

1:16:15.353 --> 1:16:17.137
vibrating
through the walls, and...

1:16:18.617 --> 1:16:21.664
I just... I wasn't what she
wanted. What she imagined for
herself.

1:16:24.536 --> 1:16:25.668
I'm sorry.

1:16:25.711 --> 1:16:28.018
Yeah, well, you
can quit judging me

1:16:29.019 --> 1:16:30.673
you know, my life, my work.

1:16:31.978 --> 1:16:34.633
You don't actually care about
the truth of my life.

1:16:35.808 --> 1:16:38.724
You just wanted
something... exotic.

1:16:39.682 --> 1:16:41.292
A broken little whore.

1:16:43.337 --> 1:16:44.687
And I guess you found him.

1:16:46.079 --> 1:16:47.211
Well done you.

1:17:10.843 --> 1:17:12.845
I'm gonna leave now, Nancy.

1:17:15.718 --> 1:17:17.720
You can have a refund
on the time.

1:18:30.053 --> 1:18:31.532
Can I get you anything?

1:18:31.576 --> 1:18:33.491
No, thanks, I'm
waiting for someone.

1:18:33.534 --> 1:18:34.622
OK.

1:18:43.849 --> 1:18:45.546
Can I get you anything?
- I said no tha--

1:18:45.590 --> 1:18:47.418
Oh, sorry,
you're a different one.

1:18:47.461 --> 1:18:49.420
Thanks a lot, I'm
waiting for someone.

1:18:49.463 --> 1:18:52.292
Can I get you anything
while you wait?
- Nothing, thank you.

1:19:01.954 --> 1:19:03.826
Can I get you--
- No, thank you. Sorry.

1:19:03.869 --> 1:19:08.482
Thank you, no, I'm waiting, I
will wait, I will wait for
my friend.

1:19:10.049 --> 1:19:11.703
Oh, you used to teach me.

1:19:12.095 --> 1:19:13.618
Sorry?
- Yeah.

1:19:13.661 --> 1:19:15.098
Mrs Robinson. RE.

1:19:15.141 --> 1:19:17.317
Oh, keep your voice
down a little, would you?

1:19:20.146 --> 1:19:21.539
What are you doing here then?

1:19:21.974 --> 1:19:25.543
Um, ah, well, I'm
meeting a friend. Yeah.

1:19:26.674 --> 1:19:28.198
Cos the parking here's so good.

1:19:29.808 --> 1:19:31.767
Well, it's certainly better
than the coffee.

1:19:34.595 --> 1:19:36.423
I'm Becky Foster,
do you remember me?

1:19:36.467 --> 1:19:39.035
Um, no, actually.
I... funnily enough, I don't.

1:19:39.078 --> 1:19:41.124
Sorry.
- Yeah, you used to teach me
in Year 8.

1:19:41.167 --> 1:19:42.952
Did I? I can't have
taught you very well, could I?

1:19:42.995 --> 1:19:44.780
Why's that?
- Cos you're working here.

1:19:45.476 --> 1:19:46.477
Hello.

1:19:46.520 --> 1:19:47.608
Oh!

1:19:47.652 --> 1:19:48.827
Where did you come from?

1:19:49.523 --> 1:19:51.177
Um...
- This your friend, then?

1:19:52.657 --> 1:19:54.964
Yeah, well, he's...

1:19:55.791 --> 1:19:58.054
Well...
- Uh, I'm trying to sell my car.

1:19:58.619 --> 1:20:00.621
Um, this good lady is interested

1:20:00.665 --> 1:20:03.668
so we thought this was a great
place to meet to have a
look at it.

1:20:03.711 --> 1:20:05.670
Mm. Mm-hmm.
Cos the parking's so good.

1:20:05.713 --> 1:20:07.367
Well, it's certainly better
than the coffee.

1:20:09.369 --> 1:20:11.502
We'll take two of
those coffees, anyway.

1:20:11.545 --> 1:20:12.895
We'll take the risk. Thank you.

1:20:20.990 --> 1:20:22.687
Shall we sit?

1:20:24.384 --> 1:20:25.429
Yeah.

1:20:35.221 --> 1:20:36.266
You came.

1:20:37.920 --> 1:20:39.051
You booked.

1:20:39.747 --> 1:20:40.923
I didn't think you would.

1:20:41.749 --> 1:20:43.099
I wasn't sure I would either.

1:20:43.926 --> 1:20:45.623
But we both know the deal today.

1:20:46.580 --> 1:20:49.453
Still, I'm very glad that you
decided to come, just to talk.

1:20:53.936 --> 1:20:54.937
Lovely.

1:20:56.634 --> 1:20:58.157
Thank you.

1:20:58.201 --> 1:20:59.289
Thank you.

1:21:12.258 --> 1:21:13.956
It's a powerful thing.

1:21:14.347 --> 1:21:15.871
Sexual fulfilment.

1:21:16.784 --> 1:21:19.962
It makes you feel... Well,
it made me feel invincible.

1:21:20.440 --> 1:21:21.659
I hadn't realised.

1:21:22.747 --> 1:21:25.097
I wish I'd known sooner,
when I was younger.

1:21:25.141 --> 1:21:27.143
I'd have made
the necessary changes.

1:21:27.186 --> 1:21:28.579
At least you've done that now.

1:21:28.622 --> 1:21:30.537
Yes. Yes.

1:21:30.581 --> 1:21:34.411
And you know, I have felt more
alive and more powerful in this
last month

1:21:34.454 --> 1:21:35.891
than I can ever remember.

1:21:36.804 --> 1:21:38.328
I mean, I see my friends...

1:21:39.285 --> 1:21:41.244
fading away at the edges.

1:21:41.287 --> 1:21:43.202
Just shrivelling up
over the years

1:21:43.246 --> 1:21:44.856
and I think...

1:21:45.596 --> 1:21:48.338
actually, you're right, Leo,
this should be a public service.

1:21:49.730 --> 1:21:52.690
You told a couple of
them about me. Your friends.

1:21:53.604 --> 1:21:57.608
Yes, I have made recommendations
for the great Leo Grande.

1:21:58.696 --> 1:22:00.872
I told them you're the
master of the menopause.

1:22:02.004 --> 1:22:03.701
I'll put it on my business card.

1:22:04.528 --> 1:22:06.008
I've been very
discreet of course.

1:22:06.051 --> 1:22:08.053
I've only told the ones
I thought could really use...

1:22:08.097 --> 1:22:10.012
Need it... You... Need you.

1:22:10.882 --> 1:22:12.144
Well, I appreciate that.

1:22:13.058 --> 1:22:14.059
Mm.

1:22:16.496 --> 1:22:17.715
Uh...

1:22:17.758 --> 1:22:20.761
Leo, my name, my real name

1:22:21.371 --> 1:22:22.938
is Susan Robinson.

1:22:23.590 --> 1:22:25.679
Such a boring name, isn't it?

1:22:25.723 --> 1:22:28.726
Mrs Robinson. Hmm.
That's cute.

1:22:30.467 --> 1:22:34.036
I've never done anything
interesting or remarkable
in my life.

1:22:34.079 --> 1:22:35.559
Um, this is it.

1:22:36.168 --> 1:22:37.953
I always obeyed all the rules

1:22:38.388 --> 1:22:39.432
fell in line.

1:22:40.390 --> 1:22:45.090
I never drank too much, never
overshadowed my husband
at parties.

1:22:45.134 --> 1:22:47.092
I was always
the designated driver.

1:22:47.136 --> 1:22:48.615
Ate my five a day.

1:22:48.659 --> 1:22:50.574
Even before they were called
"five a day."

1:22:50.966 --> 1:22:54.099
And I always, always
answer my phone when it rings.

1:22:55.448 --> 1:22:57.581
You're the only adventure
I've ever had.

1:22:58.930 --> 1:23:00.497
The only freedom, and...

1:23:01.498 --> 1:23:03.065
I wanted it to be real.

1:23:04.109 --> 1:23:05.850
I wasn't
thinking about it properly.

1:23:06.720 --> 1:23:10.550
I was mad with some fever...

1:23:11.551 --> 1:23:13.075
lust or whatever.

1:23:14.685 --> 1:23:16.034
It made me mad.

1:23:16.687 --> 1:23:18.210
I never... I've never...

1:23:20.691 --> 1:23:21.953
I'm sorry, Leo.

1:23:22.867 --> 1:23:23.781
I'm so...

1:23:33.921 --> 1:23:36.054
That's it.
- Mm. That's it.

1:23:36.098 --> 1:23:38.622
I just wanted to see you,
see you were alright.

1:23:39.449 --> 1:23:41.277
Tell you what
you've done for me.

1:23:42.104 --> 1:23:44.280
To thank you
and to say goodbye.

1:23:46.238 --> 1:23:48.153
Everything OK
here, Mrs Robinson?

1:23:48.197 --> 1:23:51.374
Yes, um, thank you.
We're just wrapping up here now.

1:23:51.417 --> 1:23:53.550
Mrs Robinson used to
teach me RE at school.

1:23:53.593 --> 1:23:54.725
Oh, yeah?

1:23:54.768 --> 1:23:55.987
Thank you, Becky.

1:23:56.031 --> 1:23:57.728
Yes.
- Was she a good teacher?

1:23:57.771 --> 1:23:59.817
She was alright. Bit uptight.

1:24:00.296 --> 1:24:02.167
Not as bad as some of
the others.
- Uh-huh.

1:24:02.211 --> 1:24:04.952
Yeah. Except
for this one time...

1:24:04.996 --> 1:24:07.042
Thank you, Becky,
for that glowing report.

1:24:07.085 --> 1:24:09.435
She got all us girls together
for a special assembly.

1:24:09.479 --> 1:24:11.220
Becky...
- No, no, go on.

1:24:11.263 --> 1:24:13.396
And she told us
we were all sluts.

1:24:13.439 --> 1:24:15.572
I don't think that's quite
what happened, Becky.

1:24:15.615 --> 1:24:18.357
Yeah, she said girls
should look respectable

1:24:18.401 --> 1:24:21.273
or we would go around tempting
the men and get ourselves
into trouble.

1:24:21.317 --> 1:24:24.233
She said if we looked like
sluts, we'd be
treated like sluts.

1:24:24.276 --> 1:24:26.539
Well, it was to do with
the length of the skirts mostly

1:24:26.583 --> 1:24:28.367
which had just got
out of control by then.

1:24:28.411 --> 1:24:30.978
Said if we spent as much time
on our studies

1:24:31.022 --> 1:24:33.546
as we did on our hair,
we'd all be a lot better off.

1:24:33.590 --> 1:24:36.027
Well, actually, I do...
I stand by that. I stand
by that.

1:24:36.071 --> 1:24:37.333
"Concupiscence".

1:24:37.898 --> 1:24:39.465
Always remember that, too.

1:24:39.509 --> 1:24:40.945
She used to make us say...

1:24:41.859 --> 1:24:43.426
Said she liked the sound of it.

1:24:43.469 --> 1:24:44.775
I did too.

1:24:44.818 --> 1:24:46.994
Well, I'm glad to hear it.
It's a good word.

1:24:47.038 --> 1:24:49.171
What does it mean?
- "Lustful desire".

1:24:49.214 --> 1:24:52.174
Oh. Well, well.
Now you're talking.

1:24:52.217 --> 1:24:54.089
Mm. Yes, St Augustine of Hippo

1:24:54.132 --> 1:24:56.221
coined the term
in his doctrine of original sin.

1:24:56.265 --> 1:24:58.354
He believed that it underpins
all the suffering and sins in
the world.

1:24:58.397 --> 1:25:00.138
So Becky, could we
please have that bill?

1:25:00.182 --> 1:25:02.140
Well, I don't think I can
go along with that

1:25:02.184 --> 1:25:04.882
cos it doesn't make any
"Concupi-sense" to me at all.

1:25:07.450 --> 1:25:08.712
Longest word I know.

1:25:09.887 --> 1:25:10.975
The bill, please, Becky!

1:25:16.328 --> 1:25:18.635
My legacy. As an educator.

1:25:21.246 --> 1:25:24.641
"Concupiscence".
It is a good word.

1:25:24.684 --> 1:25:26.208
It's a new one on me.

1:25:26.251 --> 1:25:27.992
Oh, well, I'm glad to
have found one you didn't know.

1:25:28.035 --> 1:25:29.036
I was hoping I would.

1:25:32.997 --> 1:25:34.999
I... I told my brother.

1:25:35.391 --> 1:25:36.392
About what I do.

1:25:37.871 --> 1:25:39.612
What did he say?

1:25:39.656 --> 1:25:42.920
Well, he was surprised
to hear me say it, out loud.

1:25:43.747 --> 1:25:46.924
But he guessed I made money
with something like this.

1:25:46.967 --> 1:25:49.318
He, um, he said he
kind of already knew.

1:25:50.797 --> 1:25:53.104
And he never believed
the oil rig stories.

1:25:54.975 --> 1:25:57.543
He said Mum would
never talk about me.

1:25:58.588 --> 1:26:00.677
About what she saw.
About what happened.

1:26:03.201 --> 1:26:04.246
Mm.

1:26:04.811 --> 1:26:06.813
Guess I was a
bit wild for my mum.

1:26:08.424 --> 1:26:09.816
A lot for her to handle.

1:26:11.731 --> 1:26:15.039
There was this one night,
back then when I thought...

1:26:15.082 --> 1:26:17.128
uh, she was gone out
for the weekend.

1:26:17.868 --> 1:26:19.870
But I was wrong, um...

1:26:21.567 --> 1:26:24.222
I had some friends over
to hang out after exams

1:26:24.266 --> 1:26:26.529
we put on some
music, drank some wine...

1:26:27.791 --> 1:26:31.621
Next thing I know, she and a
neighbour are walking in on me
and my friends

1:26:32.143 --> 1:26:33.188
and we're all...

1:26:34.667 --> 1:26:37.627
bodies wrapped up together,
bit of everything going on.

1:26:39.106 --> 1:26:42.806
Um... exploring each other.

1:26:45.504 --> 1:26:47.289
And I'll never forget her face.

1:26:47.985 --> 1:26:51.075
Just humiliated. So ashamed.

1:26:54.121 --> 1:26:56.907
We tried for weeks after
to patch things up, but, um...

1:26:58.778 --> 1:27:00.606
her disgust was
just all over her.

1:27:00.650 --> 1:27:02.652
I... had to leave.

1:27:04.784 --> 1:27:07.309
She, um, said she
was glad I was going

1:27:07.352 --> 1:27:09.615
and that she would never speak
my name again.

1:27:11.617 --> 1:27:13.184
And from that point on

1:27:13.228 --> 1:27:15.969
she told everyone that that
was the day her son had died.

1:27:16.013 --> 1:27:17.101
Mm.

1:27:20.104 --> 1:27:22.715
Surely, surely,
time's a great...

1:27:22.759 --> 1:27:23.977
Healer? Yeah.
- ...healer.

1:27:25.327 --> 1:27:27.633
No, Nancy, she... she meant it.

1:27:29.026 --> 1:27:31.463
I even saw her a couple
of years ago in the street.

1:27:31.507 --> 1:27:34.074
She just... she walked
straight past me.

1:27:37.469 --> 1:27:38.949
Yeah, just cold.

1:27:41.865 --> 1:27:43.910
Would you do
that to your own son?

1:27:43.954 --> 1:27:46.739
Well, only because he's so
unremarkable I might not
notice him.

1:27:50.395 --> 1:27:52.702
I should probably stop saying
things like that about him.

1:27:52.745 --> 1:27:54.312
Yeah, you probably should.

1:27:54.747 --> 1:27:57.141
No, he's a good boy
and I'm very lucky to have him.

1:27:59.448 --> 1:28:01.798
She was wrong, your mother.

1:28:01.841 --> 1:28:06.498
There is nothing disgusting
or disappointing about you.

1:28:10.589 --> 1:28:11.764
Thank you, Becky.

1:28:12.678 --> 1:28:14.114
Becky, could you wait a moment?

1:28:18.858 --> 1:28:20.773
Becky, I would
like to apologise to you.

1:28:21.861 --> 1:28:23.298
What?
- Yes.

1:28:23.341 --> 1:28:24.560
I owe you an apology.

1:28:25.038 --> 1:28:27.302
For calling you a slut.
That was wrong.

1:28:27.345 --> 1:28:29.782
That was not a word
or idea I should have used

1:28:29.826 --> 1:28:32.219
with a group
of impressionable teenage girls.

1:28:32.263 --> 1:28:34.744
I thought I was doing
the right thing at the time...

1:28:36.006 --> 1:28:39.139
trying to
protect you, but now...

1:28:41.751 --> 1:28:42.926
But now, I...

1:28:46.059 --> 1:28:47.104
Becky...

1:28:47.887 --> 1:28:49.759
I am not here
to buy this man's car.

1:28:50.499 --> 1:28:51.500
OK.

1:28:51.543 --> 1:28:55.330
This is
Leo Grande and he is a...

1:28:59.116 --> 1:29:00.247
I'm a sex worker.

1:29:00.291 --> 1:29:01.814
Yes. Yes.

1:29:01.858 --> 1:29:04.164
And we have been meeting

1:29:04.208 --> 1:29:06.689
for sex regularly
for the past few weeks.

1:29:06.732 --> 1:29:08.255
That's right.
- That's right, that's right.

1:29:08.299 --> 1:29:11.433
And, um, I recommend him highly

1:29:11.476 --> 1:29:14.871
cos from anything else he's an
absolute marvel with his tongue.

1:29:14.914 --> 1:29:18.570
And, um, Becky, you
may already know this

1:29:18.614 --> 1:29:22.269
I hope you do, but
pleasure is a wonderful thing.

1:29:22.966 --> 1:29:24.533
It's something
we should all have.

1:29:28.101 --> 1:29:29.146
Um...

1:29:29.668 --> 1:29:31.366
If you'll excuse us

1:29:31.409 --> 1:29:33.280
uh, I have a
room booked upstairs

1:29:33.324 --> 1:29:35.457
and um,
Leo and I need to get going

1:29:35.500 --> 1:29:37.894
if we want to fit a session in
in the remaining time

1:29:37.937 --> 1:29:39.417
cos, um...

1:29:39.461 --> 1:29:41.419
...there's a couple of things
I'd like to try.

1:29:52.474 --> 1:29:53.910
It was great to meet you, Becky.

1:29:53.953 --> 1:29:57.217
I hope maybe we'll run into
each other again sometime.

1:30:01.483 --> 1:30:02.658
Keep the change.

1:30:20.893 --> 1:30:23.243
Take those off, Nancy Stokes.

1:30:36.431 --> 1:30:38.476
I can't bal... I can't balance
like this. I can't balance.

1:30:38.520 --> 1:30:39.434
OK.

1:30:40.652 --> 1:30:41.653
Oh-oh...

1:31:16.122 --> 1:31:17.167
Did you?

1:31:17.210 --> 1:31:18.516
Stop asking.

1:31:18.560 --> 1:31:20.562
OK.
- You're fixated.

1:31:21.388 --> 1:31:22.651
I think you should drop it.

1:31:24.827 --> 1:31:26.263
I know, I know, I just...

1:31:26.655 --> 1:31:29.309
There's no pressure, of course,
I was just hoping.

1:31:29.353 --> 1:31:31.747
Maybe all the others are faking.

1:31:32.530 --> 1:31:33.836
Have you ever thought of that?

1:31:39.711 --> 1:31:41.104
No.
- I'm joking.

1:31:43.672 --> 1:31:45.674
We'll try one
more time. Just for fun.

1:31:47.414 --> 1:31:49.460
Oh, OK. If you must...

1:31:52.028 --> 1:31:53.464
Close your eyes.

1:32:03.256 --> 1:32:05.128
Hang on, I brought something
with me

1:32:05.171 --> 1:32:06.782
that you might like to try.

1:32:07.434 --> 1:32:08.610
Oh, you know what?

1:32:08.653 --> 1:32:10.350
Leo, I don't think I can.

1:32:10.786 --> 1:32:13.832
I... I think I'm done.

1:32:42.861 --> 1:32:44.820
I thought I brought
the little bugger.

1:32:46.256 --> 1:32:47.518
It usually works.

1:33:02.185 --> 1:33:03.621
Here it is.

1:33:05.144 --> 1:33:06.102
Mm.

1:33:06.145 --> 1:33:07.233
Was that...

1:33:32.041 --> 1:33:35.784
Leo, I think this should be
the last time we meet.

1:33:38.308 --> 1:33:39.526
I'm glad you booked me.

1:33:40.136 --> 1:33:43.574
I'm glad you came.
- I'm glad youcame.

1:33:45.358 --> 1:33:46.316
Right?

1:33:47.752 --> 1:33:50.363
I'm very satisfied customer,
put it like that.

1:33:50.407 --> 1:33:54.585
I shall be ticking the big
green smiley face on the
feedback form.

1:33:55.804 --> 1:33:56.935
OK.

1:33:59.546 --> 1:34:00.547
Well...

1:34:00.983 --> 1:34:01.940
Well...

1:34:02.811 --> 1:34:04.769
Good bye, then, Leo Grande.

1:34:05.422 --> 1:34:06.771
And good luck to you.

1:34:10.862 --> 1:34:12.081
Good luck to you.

1:34:14.910 --> 1:34:16.128
Take care, Nancy.
