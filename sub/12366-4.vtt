WEBVTT

00:05.498 --> 00:07.652
Ice. I need ice.

00:08.426 --> 00:10.337
I realize it's happy
hour somewhere,

00:10.372 --> 00:13.039
but isn't it a bit
early even for you?

00:13.074 --> 00:15.341
This happens to
be an emergency.

00:15.376 --> 00:18.462
I pulled a muscle
fastening my bra.

00:21.656 --> 00:22.904
What's goin' on?

00:22.939 --> 00:25.390
Victoria's having
a senior moment.

00:25.425 --> 00:27.707
Oh, I have those all the time.

00:27.742 --> 00:30.162
I can be walking along
happy as a clam,

00:30.197 --> 00:33.253
and suddenly I get
this overwhelming urge

00:33.288 --> 00:35.802
to hit some young
person with a stick.

00:38.288 --> 00:39.964
Hey, guys, look at this!

00:39.999 --> 00:41.902
Another sign I'm meant
to be in Cleveland.

00:41.937 --> 00:44.536
The rock and roll hall of
fame is having a huge party.

00:44.571 --> 00:47.361
All these rock stars are
donating their guitars,

00:47.396 --> 00:50.838
- and Hailey Nash is one of them.
- Oh, lord, Hailey Nash?

00:50.873 --> 00:54.117
All those dreadful female
empowerment songs?

00:54.152 --> 00:57.726
Her music takes me back to
a time when music sucked.

00:59.867 --> 01:01.777
Well, I love Hailey's songs.

01:02.304 --> 01:03.809
It reminds me of prom night.

01:03.844 --> 01:05.806
They played Hailey
Nash at your prom?

01:05.841 --> 01:07.443
No, in my room.

01:07.478 --> 01:09.181
Nobody asked me to the prom.

01:09.216 --> 01:12.655
Course, that was during
my corrective shoe years.

01:12.690 --> 01:15.629
Was that before or after
your headgear years?

01:16.043 --> 01:17.693
There was some overlap.

01:18.838 --> 01:20.273
But Hailey got me through it.

01:20.308 --> 01:23.080
Oh! Tonight, I am going to do

01:23.115 --> 01:24.416
two things from my book.

01:24.451 --> 01:26.653
I'm gonna crash a party
and meet my idol.

01:26.688 --> 01:28.290
And I am coming with you.

01:28.325 --> 01:30.962
What? Why? Weren't we just
mocking her? I'm confused.

01:30.997 --> 01:33.500
That bastard Johnny
revere is gonna be there.

01:33.535 --> 01:35.370
You know Johnny revere?

01:35.405 --> 01:36.805
Every inch of him.

01:38.177 --> 01:39.879
One night, he pulled
me from the audience

01:39.914 --> 01:41.315
to dance on stage

01:41.350 --> 01:45.055
and gave me a backstage pass to
the best six months of my life.

01:45.090 --> 01:46.925
So why is he a bastard?

01:46.960 --> 01:48.360
Because halfway
through the tour,

01:48.395 --> 01:51.733
he left me stranded on a
corner in Winslow, Arizona.

01:52.523 --> 01:54.171
Wait, isn't that
an eagles song?

01:54.206 --> 01:56.241
Never tell don Henley
anything in confidence

01:56.276 --> 01:57.976
when you're doing shots.

01:59.314 --> 02:01.382
Why did you never tell us?

02:01.417 --> 02:03.767
Because it was just
too humiliating.

02:04.130 --> 02:05.689
Oh, is he the one
who gave you the--

02:05.724 --> 02:08.727
no, no, no,
that was Warren Beatty.

02:08.762 --> 02:12.366
Anyway, now that I'm famous
and Johnny is a museum piece,

02:12.401 --> 02:13.868
it is going to be
such a pleasure

02:13.903 --> 02:17.073
to finally be able to throw
a drink right in his face.

02:17.108 --> 02:19.109
Ooh, that sounds
very satisfying.

02:19.144 --> 02:20.812
I've never thrown
a drink at a man.

02:20.847 --> 02:22.714
I mean, I've slapped
a couple of faces,

02:22.749 --> 02:24.651
egged a few cars,

02:24.686 --> 02:26.687
set the odd house on fire.

02:26.722 --> 02:28.189
But a drink in the face?

02:28.224 --> 02:29.725
That's gonna be fun.

02:31.000 --> 02:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:43.160 --> 02:45.080
I don't see Johnny anywhere.

02:45.115 --> 02:47.116
Just a sea of '70s hair...

02:47.151 --> 02:50.420
And '90s hairpieces.

02:50.455 --> 02:53.525
Some of these rockers look
remarkably well-preserved.

02:53.560 --> 02:56.260
Forget Botox. I'm going
straight to heroin.

02:57.833 --> 02:59.768
I can't believe that
after all these years,

02:59.803 --> 03:03.006
I am finally going to throw
a drink in Johnny's face.

03:03.508 --> 03:05.475
- What can I get you ladies?
- Uh, scotch...

03:05.510 --> 03:08.112
With enough rocks
to leave bruises.

03:08.147 --> 03:10.081
Oh, my gosh.

03:10.116 --> 03:12.785
I just motor-boated
Hailey Nash's breasts.

03:15.389 --> 03:16.856
Go on.

03:16.891 --> 03:18.825
No, it was an insane accident.

03:18.860 --> 03:21.095
I--I was turning a corner,
and I tripped,

03:21.130 --> 03:23.164
and I fell face-first
into her cleavage,

03:23.199 --> 03:24.599
and then my earring got caught,

03:24.634 --> 03:27.837
and I was wrestling free.

03:30.008 --> 03:31.675
What did you say to her?

03:31.710 --> 03:32.977
"Soft."

03:35.381 --> 03:36.481
What?

03:36.516 --> 03:38.050
Well, I was thinking "sorry,"

03:38.085 --> 03:41.585
but I was also thinking "soft,"
and the wrong one came out.

03:42.138 --> 03:46.227
Any of you over-age groupies
seen Willie Nelson?

03:47.053 --> 03:48.696
Elka, what are you doing here?

03:48.731 --> 03:52.281
Well, whenever Willie's in town,
I always bake him brownies.

03:53.437 --> 03:54.838
I knew it.

03:56.074 --> 03:58.508
Wait. These are just brownies.

03:58.543 --> 03:59.993
Of course they are.

04:00.288 --> 04:01.947
What are you smoking?

04:03.282 --> 04:05.918
- Young man.
- Yes?

04:05.953 --> 04:07.203
Well,

04:07.755 --> 04:10.791
you're a lot to take in,
aren't you?

04:11.826 --> 04:15.897
Oh, uh, have you seen the
redheaded stranger anywhere?

04:15.932 --> 04:18.132
Come on, shawty, let's check
in the V.I.P. section.

04:18.166 --> 04:20.452
Oh, will jay-z be there?

04:22.572 --> 04:25.472
There are a lot of layers
to that little onion.

04:27.567 --> 04:29.461
Oh, there's Johnny.

04:30.526 --> 04:31.778
Oh, my God, he spotted me.

04:31.813 --> 04:32.911
He's coming over.

04:32.946 --> 04:34.046
Okay, this is it.

04:34.081 --> 04:35.947
- Um, where's my ammunition?
- Here.

04:35.982 --> 04:37.748
Right, keep your elbow low,

04:37.783 --> 04:39.182
follow through with your swing.

04:39.217 --> 04:40.850
Remember,
this is for every woman

04:40.885 --> 04:44.288
who ever got dumped by
a heartless bastard.

04:44.323 --> 04:46.191
- Victoria!
- Johnny.

04:46.226 --> 04:48.293
Wow! You look
frickin' amazing.

04:48.328 --> 04:50.328
Oh, why, thank you.

04:53.547 --> 04:57.255
Seriously, you look even sexier in
person than you did on your show.

04:57.583 --> 04:59.321
You watched <i>edge of tomorrow?</i>

04:59.356 --> 05:00.388
Sure.

05:00.423 --> 05:01.890
I was always bragging
to the roadies

05:01.925 --> 05:05.260
how I used to drill you
like the Gulf of Mexico.

05:08.263 --> 05:11.632
You still don't follow
the news, do you?

05:12.767 --> 05:16.067
Excuse me. Mr. revere,
they need you in the press room.

05:16.503 --> 05:17.569
The price of fame.

05:17.604 --> 05:19.704
I know it well.

05:19.739 --> 05:21.706
You know, it's too bad
you're with your friends,

05:21.741 --> 05:23.407
or you could come
by the hotel later.

05:23.442 --> 05:25.876
Oh, they're not my friends.

05:27.078 --> 05:30.247
St. Regent, top floor.

05:31.716 --> 05:35.717
Well, that was the most
disgusting thing I've ever seen,

05:35.752 --> 05:39.387
and I used to wax Roseanne.

05:39.422 --> 05:41.255
Well, I couldn't help it.

05:41.290 --> 05:43.924
Watchin' that bad-boy swagger
sent chills down my spine

05:43.959 --> 05:45.759
I haven't felt in years.

05:45.794 --> 05:47.727
He didn't even apologize!

05:47.762 --> 05:50.463
I know. How hot was that?

05:51.665 --> 05:53.365
Still here, huh?

05:53.400 --> 05:55.667
You know, with all these
pretty young girls around,

05:55.702 --> 05:59.470
you last-call connies
don't stand a chance.

06:01.873 --> 06:03.773
It may interest you to know

06:03.808 --> 06:05.340
that tonight Johnny
revere and I

06:05.375 --> 06:07.475
are going to have the
kind of smoking hot sex

06:07.510 --> 06:10.946
that children only read
about in story books.

06:10.981 --> 06:13.782
Come on, he's callous
and misogynous,

06:13.817 --> 06:15.149
and I don't even think
he showered today.

06:15.184 --> 06:18.286
That's okay,
I'll just lick him clean.

06:18.321 --> 06:20.988
Victoria! This is a mistake!

06:21.023 --> 06:23.324
Don't be a holla back girl.

06:25.327 --> 06:28.077
Am I using that right?
'Cause it felt right.

06:29.230 --> 06:33.433
Oh, let it go, Mel. There's no
girlfriend block for bad-boy sex.

06:33.648 --> 06:36.301
You're right.
Its power is too strong.

06:36.336 --> 06:39.204
That guilty thrill you
get just being with him.

06:39.239 --> 06:42.673
That desperate desire
you have to change him.

06:42.708 --> 06:44.941
And that delicious
little tickle

06:44.976 --> 06:47.610
that comes from knowing
you never could.

06:52.118 --> 06:56.985
What? You think there weren't
bad boys in Poland in the '30s?

06:57.542 --> 07:00.820
You know, before I met Johnny,
I didn't know the meaning of depravity

07:00.855 --> 07:03.221
or hotel blacklisting.

07:03.256 --> 07:05.256
There was this one
time on a credenza.

07:05.291 --> 07:08.826
Oh, my God. I mean,
no surface was safe.

07:08.861 --> 07:11.662
Oh, we did it on coffee
tables, club chairs,

07:11.697 --> 07:13.831
and this one really
memorable Thanksgiving,

07:13.866 --> 07:17.569
in a bathtub full of
sweet potatoes and gravy.

07:19.104 --> 07:22.854
Okay, before we get to what you
did with the turkey legs, think.

07:23.218 --> 07:25.876
If you sleep with him,
he'll just dump you again,

07:25.911 --> 07:27.743
and then he'll be the
one that got away again.

07:27.778 --> 07:29.911
Who cares? He's not
the man that got away.

07:29.946 --> 07:33.881
He's the sex that got away,
and tonight I am getting it back.

07:33.916 --> 07:35.915
Well, just make sure none
of those old feelings

07:35.950 --> 07:37.116
come back with it.

07:37.151 --> 07:39.351
Oh, please, I am not
that nubile little ninny

07:39.386 --> 07:41.287
who used to prance around
naked on his balcony--

07:41.322 --> 07:44.090
oh, my God! He hasn't seen me
naked since I was in my 20s!

07:44.125 --> 07:46.226
Ooh, forget diamonds.

07:46.261 --> 07:49.061
After 40, covers are
a girl's best friend.

07:50.130 --> 07:52.863
Word to the wise.
A smart jockey

07:52.898 --> 07:55.298
always sits straight
up on the horse.

07:56.401 --> 08:00.870
- See, you're the jockey, and he's...
- Yes, yes, we understand.

08:00.905 --> 08:03.372
It's so your boobs
don't flop to the side

08:03.407 --> 08:06.141
and get lost in your back fat.

08:17.497 --> 08:20.552
Are you as turned on as I am?

08:20.587 --> 08:22.187
God, this is a disaster.

08:22.222 --> 08:23.988
I'm not even dressed for sex.

08:24.023 --> 08:26.457
Trade underwear with me.

08:26.492 --> 08:29.193
Why do you automatically
ask joy and not me?

08:29.228 --> 08:34.097
Because cotton is the fabric of
your life, darling, not mine.

08:34.131 --> 08:36.131
- Cotton breathes.
- All right.

08:36.167 --> 08:37.832
I am not swapping
knickers with you.

08:37.868 --> 08:40.702
Okay, okay, but I am definitely
gonna need an emergency wax.

08:40.736 --> 08:42.371
Well, your eyebrows look fine.

08:42.405 --> 08:45.373
It's not my eyebrows
I'm worried about.

08:45.408 --> 08:47.775
Do you think I carry a
portable waxing kit?

08:47.810 --> 08:49.979
Joy, please.

08:50.014 --> 08:51.616
Okay, fine.

08:51.677 --> 08:53.215
I'll MacGyver it.

08:54.951 --> 08:56.484
Oh, my God, are you guys crazy?

08:56.519 --> 08:58.419
Do you know how much
that's gonna hurt?

08:58.454 --> 09:03.590
But it's worth it, because tonight
I'm gonna party like it's 1979.

09:06.074 --> 09:08.815
You want a ride home?
Willie loaned me the limo.

09:08.850 --> 09:11.264
Oh, thanks, but no, no.
I have to stick around.

09:11.299 --> 09:15.949
I have to find Hailey Nash and apologize
to her for sticking my face in her boobs.

09:18.105 --> 09:19.939
Hey, I don't suppose
Willie knows her.

09:19.974 --> 09:22.776
By now, Willie doesn't
know his own name.

09:31.683 --> 09:34.579
- Hey, you.
- Hey, sexy, come on in.

09:46.811 --> 09:47.757
You okay?

09:47.792 --> 09:49.693
No, I'm fine.

09:49.728 --> 09:52.862
You know, there were a lot of
hot women at that party tonight,

09:52.897 --> 09:55.647
but none of them could
hold a candle to you.

09:59.335 --> 10:01.470
That's what you think.

10:03.005 --> 10:04.772
Sure I can't get you
something stronger?

10:04.807 --> 10:07.241
No, no, no, I have to
keep my wits about me.

10:07.276 --> 10:10.444
I accidentally groped Hailey Nash,
so I need to apologize to her.

10:10.479 --> 10:11.879
Well, here's your chance.

10:11.914 --> 10:16.683
She's right behind you.

10:16.718 --> 10:17.951
You again?

10:17.986 --> 10:19.151
I'm sorry!

10:19.186 --> 10:20.952
Oh, Ms. Nash, I'm so sorry!

10:20.987 --> 10:22.719
Oh!

10:22.754 --> 10:25.153
It's just seltzer,
so it won't stain.

10:25.188 --> 10:27.221
So there's really

10:27.256 --> 10:29.122
no reason for me to be doing...

10:29.157 --> 10:30.407
This.

10:32.444 --> 10:35.161
What is it with you
and my breasts?

10:36.346 --> 10:39.197
I'm just a really big fan.

10:39.232 --> 10:40.733
So I gather.

10:42.035 --> 10:43.501
I mean, I'm a fan of you,

10:43.536 --> 10:44.802
not your breasts.

10:44.837 --> 10:48.105
But not that I'm not a
fan of your breasts.

10:50.299 --> 10:52.909
2i am so toasted.

10:55.415 --> 10:57.011
So, what are you drinking?

10:57.046 --> 10:59.890
- What are you pouring.
- Well, nothing for me.

10:59.925 --> 11:02.377
The booze doesn't
mesh with the drugs,

11:02.560 --> 11:04.061
that never stopped you before.

11:04.096 --> 11:05.996
Yeah, that was my old liver.

11:07.800 --> 11:09.102
You're still a bourbon girl?

11:09.137 --> 11:10.823
It'll do for starters.

11:19.773 --> 11:21.463
You know that couch
doesn't bite.

11:21.498 --> 11:24.948
Oh, you know, I think I'm more
in a credenza kind of mood.

11:27.758 --> 11:28.692
Mercy.

11:29.279 --> 11:31.772
You always did look
good on mahogany.

11:32.511 --> 11:35.561
Well, I've always been
partial to good solid wood.

11:37.762 --> 11:38.990
I seem to remember that.

11:39.025 --> 11:42.575
I seem to remember been covered
in creme fraiche and caviar.

11:43.366 --> 11:45.466
So, what's on the menu tonight?

11:46.269 --> 11:49.119
A grilled chicken breast
and steam vegetables.

11:50.911 --> 11:52.472
How stoned are you?

11:52.897 --> 11:53.911
Stoned?

11:53.972 --> 11:56.688
What drugs are you on then?

11:57.477 --> 11:59.464
Celebrex and lipator.

12:01.025 --> 12:03.158
- Ah, you're joking, right?
- No.

12:03.193 --> 12:04.893
I'm a different guy now.

12:04.937 --> 12:07.385
In fact that's why I invited
you up here tonight.

12:07.420 --> 12:08.570
To apologize.

12:09.246 --> 12:10.679
Apologize?

12:10.714 --> 12:11.847
Yeah.

12:11.882 --> 12:14.015
I was a selfish bastard
when we were together,

12:14.050 --> 12:16.350
and I really feel bad about
the way I treated you.

12:16.385 --> 12:18.027
Uh-huh. I see.

12:18.063 --> 12:20.196
So, um, are we good?

12:20.231 --> 12:23.699
You have got a lot
of nerve, pal!

12:23.734 --> 12:25.733
What? All I said
was I'm sorry.

12:25.768 --> 12:27.902
Well, no girl wants
to hear that!

12:27.937 --> 12:31.206
Of course you were a bastard,
that's what made you so exciting.

12:31.241 --> 12:32.440
So why are you mad now?

12:32.475 --> 12:35.375
I thought you invited me up
here for some high-octane sex,

12:35.410 --> 12:39.712
not a low-cholesterol snack
and some crybaby apology!

12:39.747 --> 12:41.347
Whoa, I didn't know.
I'm sorry.

12:41.382 --> 12:42.581
My bad.

12:42.616 --> 12:44.850
Bad? You're practically
a boy scout!

12:44.885 --> 12:47.051
Whatever happened
to that bad boy

12:47.086 --> 12:50.754
who used to bounce me around
like a jai alai ball?

12:50.789 --> 12:52.690
You think I still can't?

12:52.725 --> 12:54.057
Oh, please.

12:54.092 --> 12:57.593
Why don't you just help some
old lady across the street?

12:57.628 --> 13:01.729
God, what a waste of a wax
job this turned out to be!

13:01.764 --> 13:03.130
Heart-shaped?

13:03.165 --> 13:04.231
Well, it was the plan,

13:04.266 --> 13:06.666
but it turned out
kind of shamrock-y.

13:10.045 --> 13:12.171
Is it magically delicious?

13:16.242 --> 13:18.609
Well, this is supposed
to be a reunion.

13:18.644 --> 13:21.041
- Then let's make it one.
- Oh, you think you're up to it?

13:21.076 --> 13:22.478
You think you can
still handle it?

13:22.513 --> 13:24.179
- Vegas rules?
- No holds barred.

13:24.214 --> 13:27.014
- Safe word "Hendrix."
- First stop credenza.

13:30.295 --> 13:32.792
What? Am I pinching
your nipple too hard?

13:32.827 --> 13:34.727
- No, it's my knee.
- Okay.

13:36.297 --> 13:38.331
No, to the right,
to the right, to the right.

13:38.366 --> 13:40.433
Oh! Oh! Ow, my lower back.

13:40.468 --> 13:41.901
You too?

13:41.936 --> 13:43.635
Ah! Ah!

13:43.670 --> 13:45.269
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa!

13:45.304 --> 13:47.102
My hair is caught on something!

13:47.137 --> 13:49.804
It's my medic-alert bracelet.

13:51.754 --> 13:53.538
All right. Here quick,

13:55.310 --> 13:56.476
- hang on.
- What?

13:56.511 --> 13:58.244
Uh, I need to be on top.

13:58.279 --> 13:59.279
Why?

13:59.546 --> 14:02.696
Because I'm the jockey,
and you're-- oh, just do it!

14:07.253 --> 14:10.820
Aah! Wait, stop!

14:10.855 --> 14:13.689
I pulled a muscle this morning.

14:13.724 --> 14:15.324
I just wrenched my shoulder,

14:15.359 --> 14:16.991
but I think we
should play through.

14:17.026 --> 14:19.326
No, no, no! Let go! Let go!

14:19.361 --> 14:22.963
Oh, ow, ow, oh! Agony!

14:22.998 --> 14:24.431
Oh, I'm sorry.

14:24.466 --> 14:25.667
Oh.

14:32.752 --> 14:35.040
Can't even move my left arm.

14:35.075 --> 14:36.975
Well, um,

14:37.010 --> 14:39.910
seeing as how your right
arm's still working...

14:41.946 --> 14:44.246
What? I'm a bad boy.

14:44.281 --> 14:46.082
You're an idiot.

14:48.352 --> 14:51.654
God, this is so not
how I remembered it.

14:51.689 --> 14:53.456
Apparently a lot of the
things we used to do

14:53.491 --> 14:55.390
are pretty painful if
you're not wasted.

14:55.425 --> 14:58.092
Yeah, or 20.

14:58.127 --> 15:01.529
I suppose we could just
have low-key grown-up sex.

15:01.564 --> 15:06.333
Uh, thanks,
but why ruin the memories?

15:06.368 --> 15:08.367
We were something together,
though, weren't we?

15:08.402 --> 15:09.501
Yeah.

15:09.536 --> 15:13.604
At least we'll always have something
degrading to look back on.

15:13.639 --> 15:15.673
Aw, maybe it'd be
better if we didn't.

15:15.708 --> 15:18.358
I mean, you can't miss
what you never had.

15:18.822 --> 15:20.710
I'm still glad we had it.

15:21.619 --> 15:23.178
Me too.

15:23.213 --> 15:25.581
You know, my orthopedist
showed me a little trick.

15:25.616 --> 15:26.866
Yeah?

15:26.916 --> 15:30.217
Oh! Oh, God, that's good.

15:30.252 --> 15:31.751
Oh.

15:31.786 --> 15:33.119
So what's the deal?

15:33.154 --> 15:36.489
I mean, you barely move
and you pull a muscle?

15:36.524 --> 15:37.758
I know, right?

15:38.097 --> 15:41.197
The other day I got a back
spasm putting on a sock.

15:56.856 --> 15:59.119
Here we are having a
wholesome Sunday morning,

15:59.154 --> 16:01.858
and Victoria's probably skulking
through some hotel lobby

16:01.893 --> 16:05.028
with her knickers stuffed in her
purse and her blouse inside out.

16:05.063 --> 16:08.197
Lucky trollop.

16:08.232 --> 16:10.466
Well, she's got less to
be ashamed of than I do.

16:10.501 --> 16:13.368
I just hope when Hailey gets
my note, she forgives me.

16:13.403 --> 16:14.669
What note?

16:14.704 --> 16:17.572
Oh, I paid the bartender
to slip her an apology

16:17.607 --> 16:19.140
and a Cd to autograph.

16:19.175 --> 16:22.042
So that way if I get it back in the
mail, I know she's forgiven me.

16:22.077 --> 16:25.211
And if you get a restraining order,
you'll know she hasn't.

16:25.246 --> 16:26.346
Oh, no.

16:26.381 --> 16:28.114
Oh, they're not that bad.

16:28.149 --> 16:29.982
You'd be surprised how
much trash talking

16:30.017 --> 16:32.184
you can do from 300 feet.

16:34.254 --> 16:37.222
Oh, here comes the
lucky trollop now.

16:38.657 --> 16:42.359
Somebody please turn out that
hideous light in the sky.

16:47.133 --> 16:50.634
You're looking properly
debased and debauched.

16:50.669 --> 16:53.904
Was the insensitive mauling
everything you hoped?

16:53.939 --> 16:58.040
He was thoughtful and caring
and very unselfish in bed.

16:58.075 --> 17:00.076
You poor thing.

17:01.244 --> 17:02.577
Are you okay?

17:02.612 --> 17:04.679
I'm more than okay.

17:04.714 --> 17:06.381
You know, we didn't
do our whole catalog,

17:06.415 --> 17:09.016
but we managed a medley
of greatest hits.

17:10.286 --> 17:12.752
And then this morning he ate
his egg whites and turkey bacon

17:12.788 --> 17:15.488
off the small of my back.

17:15.522 --> 17:18.190
Um, Melanie?

17:21.930 --> 17:25.064
Breathe. I don't see
a restraining order.

17:25.098 --> 17:29.203
Ah, you'd think being best
friends with a famous celebrity

17:29.238 --> 17:32.172
she'd be over this
by now, but...

17:32.207 --> 17:33.439
Your blouse inside out?

17:33.474 --> 17:35.507
Excuse me.

17:38.043 --> 17:39.676
I better go and help her.

17:39.711 --> 17:41.961
Yesterday she pulled
a bra muscle.

17:43.982 --> 17:45.581
You all live here together?

17:45.616 --> 17:47.015
Yeah. It's like a
big slumber party.

17:47.050 --> 17:48.816
I can't believe you're here.

17:48.851 --> 17:50.117
Please, come in and sit down.

17:50.152 --> 17:52.319
Wow, this is crazy.
I mean, I just--

17:52.354 --> 17:55.188
this is like a fantasy
come true for me.

17:55.223 --> 17:58.458
Hey, I, um, brought that
Cd you wanted me to sign.

17:58.493 --> 18:01.760
Your note was very sweet.

18:01.795 --> 18:03.828
Oh, and I meant
every word of it.

18:03.863 --> 18:06.197
You are...You're just amazing,

18:06.232 --> 18:08.565
and you're so beautiful.

18:08.600 --> 18:10.634
I mean, I can't even
begin to tell you

18:10.669 --> 18:11.935
everything that's in my heart,

18:11.970 --> 18:14.720
but I hope you know what
I mean because I...

18:19.917 --> 18:22.011
Did not see at comin'.

18:23.829 --> 18:24.909
Yeah, I know. I...

18:24.944 --> 18:27.248
I don't usually get
involved with my fans,

18:27.283 --> 18:32.919
but your passes last night
were so clumsy and pathetic...

18:32.954 --> 18:35.721
It was actually
kind of adorable.

18:35.756 --> 18:38.723
This is clearly gonna come
as a surprise to you,

18:38.758 --> 18:41.592
but I had no idea you were gay.

18:42.386 --> 18:43.386
Seriously?

18:44.964 --> 18:47.331
Not that it matters, 'cause I'm
like totally down with that.

18:47.366 --> 18:48.498
You know, I mean...

18:48.533 --> 18:51.401
I'm down with other people
being down with that.

18:51.436 --> 18:54.104
But that's nohow I get down.

18:55.941 --> 18:58.341
Wait, I don't get it.
How could you not know?

18:58.376 --> 19:00.009
Well, why would I?

19:00.044 --> 19:03.844
Well, for starters, that Cd you're
holding's called <i>i like girls.</i>

19:06.616 --> 19:10.584
Oh, so your song "love
my honey pot"...

19:10.619 --> 19:14.454
Wait, so the note
that you wrote me

19:14.489 --> 19:17.023
that said that my music
had given you the courage,

19:17.058 --> 19:19.458
you know, to let the woman
inside you come out...

19:19.493 --> 19:23.393
Ohh, right. Yeah.

19:23.463 --> 19:25.963
I can see how that
would be misleading.

19:26.391 --> 19:28.866
Yeah, but your friends upstairs,
helping each other with their bra--

19:28.901 --> 19:32.601
not gay, either.

19:32.638 --> 19:36.338
Well, you joy that CD.

19:36.373 --> 19:38.907
I'm sorry. Oh!

19:38.942 --> 19:39.942
Bye.

19:41.631 --> 19:45.113
"Love my honey pot"?

19:45.148 --> 19:47.315
A clue maybe?

19:50.252 --> 19:52.085
Oh, don't feel so bad, Melanie.

19:52.120 --> 19:55.120
I didn't know about Elton
John or George Michael.

19:56.758 --> 20:00.192
I thought he wanted <i>my</i> sex.

20:00.227 --> 20:03.494
I didn't even know the
village people were gay.

20:03.529 --> 20:04.929
Yeah, they kind of ruined

20:04.964 --> 20:10.234
that whole cowboys with short shorts
and a mustache look for straight guys.

20:10.269 --> 20:13.970
In my day, nobody knew
anything about anyone.

20:14.005 --> 20:16.339
Rock Hudson, tab hunter.

20:16.374 --> 20:20.175
I had a big thing for Liberace.

20:20.210 --> 20:22.911
You thought Liberace
was straight?

20:23.471 --> 20:25.414
I could have turned him.
