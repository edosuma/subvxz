Campos takes a dive
in the sixth.

13:46.201 --> 13:49.246
That's what you have
for me?

13:49.246 --> 13:52.249
It's a sure thing.
30 to 1.

13:52.249 --> 13:55.085
You want me to bet my money
on your sure thing?

13:55.085 --> 13:56.836
No.
I'll bet mine.

13:56.836 --> 13:58.880
How much?

13:58.880 --> 14:02.885
2 million should get you 60.

14:02.885 --> 14:05.929
That'll more than cover
your losses.

14:05.929 --> 14:09.892
Why is this boxer
accountable to you?

14:09.892 --> 14:11.351
Why does it matter?

14:11.351 --> 14:13.478
Because you make him
accountable to me.

14:13.478 --> 14:16.147
Why?

14:16.147 --> 14:20.568
It's my business.

14:20.568 --> 14:23.947
You will place the bets?

14:23.947 --> 14:28.660
And you'll return
my art?

14:28.660 --> 14:32.497
Tonight with the slips.

14:32.497 --> 14:36.126
I need to meet Mr. Campos.

14:36.126 --> 14:39.088
I want to see Avi first.

14:39.088 --> 14:42.549
Give me my art,
and you'll get your man.

14:49.472 --> 14:51.474
[exhales sharply]

14:55.104 --> 14:57.063
[phone trilling]

14:57.063 --> 14:59.149
[Fat Ernie] Hey, Boston,
what's up?

14:59.149 --> 15:01.359
- I need a favor.
- Sure, what is it?

15:01.359 --> 15:05.405
2 million on Whittaker knocking
out Campos in the sixth.

15:05.405 --> 15:09.200
Whittaker? Under seven?
That's a big fucking bet.

15:09.200 --> 15:11.286
[Ray] Can you do it or not?

15:11.286 --> 15:13.330
Yeah, sure. I got a couple
of sports books over in Macau

15:13.330 --> 15:15.081
I can edge off.

15:15.081 --> 15:18.085
Assume this is a no questions
asked kind of deal?

15:18.085 --> 15:21.338
Yeah. I'll come by with the cash
in a couple of hours.

15:21.338 --> 15:23.966
Couple of hours?
Yeah.

15:23.966 --> 15:25.884
Be nice seeing you there,
Boston.

15:25.884 --> 15:27.927
- It's been too fucking long.

15:34.642 --> 15:39.105
[phone dialing, trilling]

15:39.105 --> 15:40.940
- [Lena] Yeah?
- We're on.

15:40.940 --> 15:42.484
Fat Ernie's a piece of shit.

15:42.484 --> 15:45.487
- It's our only play.
- Did you see Avi?

15:45.487 --> 15:48.198
- [Ray] No.
- This is risky, Ray.

15:48.198 --> 15:50.075
It'll work.

15:50.075 --> 15:52.077
[Lena] You know, I had a dream
about Avi last night.

15:52.077 --> 15:54.120
He was walking down
Hollywood Boulevard

15:54.120 --> 15:56.706
looking at all
the stars' names.

15:56.706 --> 15:59.001
And I went up to talk to him,
but he didn't know who I was,

15:59.001 --> 16:00.168
so he kept walking.

16:00.168 --> 16:02.128
And...
[chuckles]

16:02.128 --> 16:03.922
...he stopped at
Marilyn Monroe's star.

16:03.922 --> 16:08.093
And...I don't know,
he just started laughing.

16:10.053 --> 16:11.971
Stay with the art.

16:11.971 --> 16:13.973
All right.

16:17.102 --> 16:18.728
You're too big
to spar with Hector.

16:18.728 --> 16:20.688
Terry, that's garbage.

16:20.688 --> 16:22.607
I did Ray's dirty work
for y'all.

16:22.607 --> 16:25.194
I took out Joxy Maguire.
Got Hector that rematch.

16:25.194 --> 16:26.277
I deserve to be more
than just a janitor.

16:26.277 --> 16:28.197
I don't wanna hear
that shit.

16:28.197 --> 16:29.697
You know what, Terry, I don't
think you want to know

16:29.697 --> 16:31.199
- what's really going on.
- No, I don't.

16:31.199 --> 16:33.576
Terry, the least you can do
is let me spar, man, come on.

16:33.576 --> 16:34.911
Not now, Daryll.

16:34.911 --> 16:36.162
Okay, if not now,
then when, goddamn it?

16:36.162 --> 16:37.997
Listen, you're an amateur,
all right?

16:37.997 --> 16:42.836
If you spar with Hector,
he gets sloppy.

16:42.836 --> 16:45.213
Hi, uh, can I help you?

16:45.213 --> 16:48.258
Hi, we're looking
for Hector Campos.

16:48.258 --> 16:50.219
Can I ask
what it's about?

16:50.219 --> 16:53.138
Well, we need to speak
with him in private, please.

16:53.138 --> 16:55.140
Hector!

16:57.475 --> 17:00.104
- Uh, you can use my office.
- Thank you.

of the day off.

Go celebrate. W--we'll set you
up with payroll tomorrow.

17:20.331 --> 17:23.001
- Man, are you sure?
- Sure.

17:23.001 --> 17:25.753
Mr. Campos,
my name is Detective Garcia.

17:25.753 --> 17:27.214
Can I speak with you
for a moment?

17:27.214 --> 17:30.049
- Sure.
- Just in the office, please.

17:33.220 --> 17:37.974
[Detective Garcia] We know this
is hard, Mr. Campos.

17:37.974 --> 17:41.644
Nah, this day was coming.

17:41.644 --> 17:43.980
She was troubled.

17:43.980 --> 17:47.442
Did your sister ever talk
about wanting to hurt herself?

17:47.442 --> 17:50.279
Yeah.
All the time.

17:50.279 --> 17:53.323
And when was the last time
you spoke with her?

17:53.323 --> 17:55.492
She was here
a couple of days ago.

17:55.492 --> 17:58.077
Caused a scene.

17:58.077 --> 18:00.079
Got herself arrested.

18:00.079 --> 18:03.458
And you haven't spoken
with her since?

18:03.458 --> 18:05.251
She texted me last night.

18:05.251 --> 18:07.545
And what did she say?

18:07.545 --> 18:11.216
Uh, ju--just that
she was sorry.

18:11.216 --> 18:13.635
That's all she said?

18:13.635 --> 18:17.263
And that she loved me.

18:17.263 --> 18:21.392
And where were you
last night?

18:21.392 --> 18:23.645
Yeah, we got to build
his confidence

18:23.645 --> 18:26.648
and get him
to trust his instincts.

18:32.654 --> 18:36.491
Thank you for your time,
Mr. Campos.

18:36.491 --> 18:38.284
Excuse me,
are you Terry Donovan?

18:38.284 --> 18:40.162
Yeah.

18:40.162 --> 18:43.332
Mr. Campos says that he was here
last night with you training.

18:43.332 --> 18:46.751
- Yeah, he was.
- Good.

18:46.751 --> 18:48.628
We'll be in touch.

18:48.628 --> 18:51.173
Oh, uh, good luck
on your rematch.

18:51.173 --> 18:53.175
Thank you.

18:57.762 --> 19:00.306
What did they say?

19:00.306 --> 19:03.226
They found her body
in Lake Hollywood.

19:46.519 --> 19:48.104
Find a guy named Fat Ernie
and give him the money.

19:48.104 --> 19:49.398
You understand?

19:49.398 --> 19:50.940
Fat Ernie?
How do I know it's him?

19:50.940 --> 19:52.191
He's 500 fucking pounds,
Mick.

19:52.191 --> 19:53.943
Open the door, Ray.

19:53.943 --> 19:55.612
- Well, what do I tell him?
- He already knows what to do.

19:55.612 --> 19:57.196
Well, explain it to me
so I know.

19:57.196 --> 20:01.200
2 million on Whittaker
winning in the sixth.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.328

I'll do it.

Those days are long gone.

20:13.463 --> 20:14.589
What do you want, Frank?

20:14.589 --> 20:17.842
I heard you killed
Ivan Belikov.

20:17.842 --> 20:19.218
I don't know anything
about it.

20:19.218 --> 20:21.263

Dead like Belikov,
right?

20:49.123 --> 20:51.084
I don't know.

20:51.084 --> 20:53.878
You know, I was thinking you'd
be a lot happier to see me, Ray.

20:53.878 --> 20:56.047
I was thinking maybe you'd be
dying your hair,

20:56.047 --> 20:58.508
changing your name to something
a little less Irish.

20:58.508 --> 21:00.968
That's what I was thinking.

You shouldn't think so much.

They wear shoulder pads,

23:07.011 --> 23:10.306

I bring it up is because, uh,

there's a preponderance of
beautiful women on this flight.

23:13.518 --> 23:14.519

38:55.542 --> 38:58.587
"You two are just alike."

to say.
