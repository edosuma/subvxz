where the woman
is the primary provider.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.083
-DANIELLE: Yeah. Well, um...
-Oh.

06:17.166 --> 06:19.333
-Right? Is that--
-DANIELLE: Yeah,
I wouldn't exactly...

06:19.417 --> 06:20.750
-put it that way, but it's--
-Oh, yes. Sorry.

06:20.834 --> 06:22.917
I'm not-- I'm not-- I'm not
trying to give away your thesis.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.041

06:24.125 --> 06:25.875

as you know,

06:33.041 --> 06:36.750

and I can work from home.

06:36.834 --> 06:38.750
Mira, she works long days and...

06:38.834 --> 06:41.458
-has to travel for work.
-And I make it up to them
on the weekends.

06:41.542 --> 06:43.834
-Yeah, and you make it home
for bedtime, when you can.
-Yeah.

06:43.917 --> 06:45.417
DANIELLE: Mm-hmm.

06:45.500 --> 06:48.291
And has this always been
your arrangement,
in terms of childcare?

06:48.375 --> 06:49.917
-Yeah, pretty much.
-Well, yeah. I had--

06:50.000 --> 06:51.250
Well, I had to take

06:51.333 --> 06:53.458
-an extra-long maternity leave.
-Yes.

06:53.542 --> 06:56.166
And, um, you know,
I'm still paying for it at work.

06:56.250 --> 06:57.250
Of course. Yeah.

06:57.333 --> 06:59.250
And my company is going public
later this year,

06:59.333 --> 07:01.709
-so that's why there's
so much extra travel.
-Yeah, and it's also, like,

07:01.792 --> 07:03.875
I'm not making a big, uh,
heroic sacrifice or anything.

07:03.959 --> 07:05.792
-No. (CHUCKLES)
-We have our babysitter,
Veronica,

07:05.875 --> 07:08.208
and she does extra hours,
uh, on the, you know,

07:08.291 --> 07:10.041
on the days
that I'm underwater at work.

07:10.125 --> 07:12.208
-DANIELLE: Sure.
-And look, it'd be great

07:12.291 --> 07:15.333
if academia paid
as well as tech does,

07:15.417 --> 07:16.959
-but it doesn't...
-It doesn't, no.

07:17.041 --> 07:19.500
...so this arrangement
makes perfect sense.

07:19.583 --> 07:21.166
-Yeah.
-DANIELLE: Mm-hmm.

07:21.250 --> 07:24.041
It sounds like
we're apologizing for it. Maybe.

07:24.125 --> 07:26.625
-DANIELLE: No, not at all.
-Yeah. No, we're proud of it.

maybe?

-Twelve years total.

07:48.375 --> 07:50.417
-Mm-hmm.
-DANIELLE: And how did you meet?

07:52.583 --> 07:54.208
-You should be the one
to tell the story.
-No.

It's way more entertaining.
Come on.

07:56.041 --> 07:58.041
(SIGHS)

07:58.125 --> 08:01.417
Is-- Can you tell me
how this is part of the study?

08:02.250 --> 08:04.500
DANIELLE:
Um, well, it's valuable

08:04.583 --> 08:07.375
in the context
of the gender perceptions

08:07.458 --> 08:09.959
you had at the beginning
of the relationship.

08:10.041 --> 08:12.041
Okay. I just-- I've...

08:12.125 --> 08:14.125
I was under the impression
that this is gonna be

08:14.208 --> 08:16.291
more like multiple choice.

08:16.959 --> 08:18.583
DANIELLE: Sorry, no.

08:19.208 --> 08:20.458
Okay.

08:21.583 --> 08:24.500
I'll tell it. It's actually--
It's a good story.

08:24.583 --> 08:25.875
-And, uh...
-Mm-hmm.

08:25.959 --> 08:27.959
You can just interject
when I get melodramatic.

08:28.041 --> 08:29.125
Sure.

08:30.417 --> 08:32.208
So, we met at Columbia.

08:32.291 --> 08:35.166
Um, we went there,
we were in a seminar together,

08:35.250 --> 08:36.709
English lit.

08:36.792 --> 08:42.291
So, um, we spent three hours
a week in a tiny little room,

08:42.375 --> 08:44.250
uh, but at this point,
there was no way

08:44.333 --> 08:46.041
-that we would have ever...
-No.

08:46.125 --> 08:48.667
I should mention that I was
still Orthodox at the time.

08:48.750 --> 08:50.500
-DANIELLE: Oh?
-Yeah. Yes.

08:50.583 --> 08:52.750
I, uh, I grew up
in a Modern Orthodox

08:52.834 --> 08:54.125
-Jewish family.
-Mm-hmm.

08:54.208 --> 08:57.417
So up until that point,
up until college, my education

08:57.500 --> 09:00.750
had been mostly single-sex,
I'd never touched a woman.

09:00.834 --> 09:05.083
So the whole thing
was pretty overwhelming,

09:05.166 --> 09:09.917
um, me with my black yarmulke
and white button-down shirts,

09:10.000 --> 09:13.583
and all these young women
in their little tank tops.

09:13.667 --> 09:16.375
And Mira specifically
was like a campus celebrity.

09:16.458 --> 09:19.583
She was dating a member
of a big rock band at the time,

09:19.667 --> 09:21.250
that needless to say
I'd never heard of.

09:21.333 --> 09:23.417
No, they were--
they weren't really rock,

09:23.500 --> 09:24.625
and they weren't big.

09:24.709 --> 09:26.792
You've probably heard of them,
Saraband? Lucas McRae?

09:26.875 --> 09:28.250
-Oh, wow.
-JONATHAN: Uh, yeah.

09:28.333 --> 09:30.750
I just thought-- I thought
of Mira as kind of a...

09:30.834 --> 09:32.250
-A what?
-No, no, no.

09:32.333 --> 09:34.417
-No. Tell me. I wanna--
-Yeah, it-- it--

09:34.500 --> 09:37.375
it's just that you were
as far away from my world

09:37.458 --> 09:39.417
as it-- as it got, you know.

09:39.500 --> 09:42.458
And anyway, I was already
engaged to a girl

09:42.542 --> 09:46.041
that I grew up with
near Long Island.

09:46.125 --> 09:47.792
-DANIELLE: Oh.
-Yeah.

09:47.875 --> 09:52.291
-So how did it happen?
-JONATHAN: (CHUCKLES)
Uh, well, she just...

09:52.375 --> 09:55.667
just walked up to me one day
and, um...

09:56.333 --> 09:57.709
This part you should tell.

09:58.500 --> 10:02.792
Um, okay. So I was in a, um...

10:02.875 --> 10:04.208
a theater group in school,

10:04.291 --> 10:06.917
and we were doing this one play
by Bashevis Singer, and--

10:07.000 --> 10:10.125
An adaptation of
Enemies, A Love Story.

10:10.208 --> 10:11.458
-Hmm.
-MIRA: Right.

10:11.542 --> 10:15.041
And, um, so I was doing all
this research on Orthodox Jews.

10:15.125 --> 10:17.458
I was very serious about acting
in college.

10:17.542 --> 10:19.458
-Oh, yeah.
-And so I just went up to him

10:19.542 --> 10:21.667
one day after class, and I asked
if I could talk to him,

10:21.750 --> 10:24.709
-and he just-- he seemed
completely horrified--
-I was, yeah, paralyzed.

10:24.792 --> 10:27.500
MIRA: Yeah. But I was
very committed to this role.

10:27.583 --> 10:28.542
JONATHAN: Absolutely.

10:28.625 --> 10:30.667
So committed
that she got completely naked

10:30.750 --> 10:32.875
-halfway through the play.
-MIRA: No! Not completely.

10:32.959 --> 10:35.875
And I'd already started
the process

10:35.959 --> 10:37.750
of, uh, leaving my religion.

10:38.709 --> 10:40.917
But, uh, no, that-- that--

10:41.000 --> 10:42.709
that show was
definitely a milestone.

10:42.792 --> 10:45.375
Mm. You mean
you actually started dating?

10:45.458 --> 10:47.709
MIRA: Oh, no, no, no, no.
Not until years later.

10:47.792 --> 10:49.542
JONATHAN: Yeah. Yeah,
I was already here in Boston,

10:49.625 --> 10:51.166
and I was, uh,

10:51.250 --> 10:53.208
...creeping around
on her Myspace page,

10:53.291 --> 10:55.625
and I saw
that she was moving here

10:55.709 --> 10:58.166
and that she was looking
for an apartment share.

10:58.250 --> 10:59.834
So we became roommates.

10:59.917 --> 11:01.917
And from there, it progressed.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.625
DANIELLE:
And who initiated that?

11:09.458 --> 11:11.083
JONATHAN:
I think it was both of us?

11:12.041 --> 11:13.959
-Yeah.
-Right?

11:14.583 --> 11:15.750
Yeah.

11:16.667 --> 11:18.750
-Both.
-(CHUCKLES)

11:20.041 --> 11:23.083
I had just come out of a series
of relationships

11:23.166 --> 11:24.291
which were...

11:24.959 --> 11:26.375
borderline abusive.

11:26.458 --> 11:30.959
And I guess
that I was addicted to that,

11:31.041 --> 11:32.166
and I-- and I was...

11:35.458 --> 11:36.667
stuck.

11:36.750 --> 11:40.125
Uh, I had a job that I could
care less about.

11:40.208 --> 11:41.875
DANIELLE: Mm.

11:41.959 --> 11:45.709
And Jonathan
was the complete opposite.

11:45.792 --> 11:48.875
Uh, he was everything
that I wanted to be.

11:49.875 --> 11:52.291
He had values, and purpose.

11:52.375 --> 11:55.166
-It's true.
-Yeah, well. Yeah, I...

11:56.208 --> 11:57.208
It's ironic because this was

11:57.291 --> 12:00.500
at the height of my
existential dread.

12:00.583 --> 12:02.333
After I left my religion,

12:02.417 --> 12:06.333
I just had these years
of loneliness and... (CHUCKLES)

12:07.667 --> 12:10.834
So... when did it happen?

12:12.750 --> 12:15.542
MIRA: Well, it happened...

12:15.625 --> 12:18.417
-thanks to the asthma, actually.
-(CHUCKLES)

12:18.500 --> 12:19.792
DANIELLE: The asthma?

12:19.875 --> 12:23.834
Yeah. There was this one time
we were coming back from the ER,

12:23.917 --> 12:26.959
I'd had a very severe attack,
and the, um, the doctor...

12:27.041 --> 12:28.083
(CLEARS THROAT)

12:28.166 --> 12:30.417
...he mistook us
for a married couple,

12:30.500 --> 12:33.375
and, uh... we liked it,

12:33.458 --> 12:38.250
and we came home
and we kept playing at it.

12:38.333 --> 12:39.500
And, um...

12:41.041 --> 12:42.959
and then it happened.

12:43.041 --> 12:45.000
DANIELLE: That's great.
That's perfect.

12:45.083 --> 12:47.125
So... All right.

12:47.208 --> 12:49.291
-Now, I'd like to hear...
-(WHISPERING) It's almost over.

12:49.375 --> 12:50.875
...a bit about, in your opinion,

12:50.959 --> 12:54.542
what is the primary factor

12:54.625 --> 12:57.583
contributing to the success
of your marriage?

12:58.333 --> 13:00.583
-Hmm.
-(CHUCKLES)

13:00.667 --> 13:02.834
-Hmm.
-I-- I'll let you take this.

13:02.917 --> 13:04.834
Interesting.
(CHUCKLES) Interesting.

13:04.917 --> 13:07.667
Could you actually tell us what
the definition of success is

13:07.750 --> 13:09.083
that you're working with?

13:09.166 --> 13:11.125
Yeah. Well, uh, first of all,

13:11.208 --> 13:13.291
it means that
you're still together.

13:13.375 --> 13:14.834
-Uh--
-That's a low bar.

13:14.917 --> 13:17.500
(LAUGHS) Yeah. Yeah.

13:17.583 --> 13:21.583
Well, does our ten years
make us statistical outliers?

13:21.667 --> 13:23.542
-DANIELLE: Mm-hmm.
-(CELL PHONE VIBRATES)

13:23.625 --> 13:26.583
DANIELLE: Well, if we ignore
all the socioeconomic

13:26.667 --> 13:28.792
and race parameters, then yes.

13:28.875 --> 13:31.583
The average marriage in the US
is 8.2 years.

13:32.417 --> 13:34.166
JONATHAN: Okay. Well then

13:34.250 --> 13:37.709
shouldn't you ask first
if subjectively that--

13:37.792 --> 13:40.917
if we perceive our marriage
to be a success at all?

13:41.917 --> 13:46.000
DANIELLE: Well, um, sure.
Yeah, if you can--

13:46.083 --> 13:48.208
JONATHAN: Yeah, I'm only saying
that because I feel like

13:48.291 --> 13:49.667
that word, "success,"

13:49.750 --> 13:52.542
is kind of emblematic
of a larger

13:52.625 --> 13:55.625
cultural misconception
about marriage.

13:55.709 --> 13:57.542
DANIELLE: Hmm.

13:57.625 --> 14:00.417
-Yeah.
-It's become this project,
right?

14:00.500 --> 14:03.166
This thing that you work on,
"We're working on our marriage."

14:03.250 --> 14:04.375
-It's this...
-MIRA: Mm.

14:04.458 --> 14:06.542
...multibillion-dollar industry.

14:06.625 --> 14:09.125
There's, you know,
self-help books,

14:09.208 --> 14:10.709
-and couples therapy...
-DANIELLE: Right.

14:10.792 --> 14:12.709
-...and workshops, and podcasts,

14:12.792 --> 14:14.250
and apps, and TV shows.

14:14.333 --> 14:15.709
It's a huge business.

14:15.792 --> 14:19.125
DANIELLE: Mm-hmm.
And you see that as a problem?

14:20.125 --> 14:21.667
Look, maybe it's because
of my background,

14:21.750 --> 14:25.166
but I just think
it's so obvious that-- that--

14:26.083 --> 14:28.458
Western culture,
consumer culture,

14:28.542 --> 14:30.375
has very purposefully created

14:30.458 --> 14:33.417
these completely
irrational expectations

14:33.500 --> 14:35.417
that marriage must,
at all times, be based

14:35.500 --> 14:36.750
on passion, on sex,

14:36.834 --> 14:38.542
on relentless
emotional intensity,

14:38.625 --> 14:41.208
when it's so obvious that
these things stem from novelty,

14:41.291 --> 14:43.500
so the whole concept's
a complete fallacy.

14:44.333 --> 14:46.583
-DANIELLE: Right. Okay.
-Mm.

14:46.667 --> 14:48.959
DANIELLE: So then,
well, what is--

14:50.000 --> 14:51.208
what's your concept?

14:54.000 --> 14:59.166
I think-- I think we both see
marriage as a means.

14:59.250 --> 15:00.625
It's not an end.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.041
Right? I think we see it
as a platform...

15:04.125 --> 15:06.834
-Mm-hmm.
-...where we both can, uh...

15:06.917 --> 15:09.166
that allows us to develop
as individuals.

15:09.250 --> 15:12.125
We're both really passionate
about the work we do, and...

15:12.208 --> 15:14.583
and our partnership gives us

15:14.667 --> 15:18.041
the safe ground to do it,
and to...

15:18.125 --> 15:21.041
raise a daughter
and have a family.

15:22.375 --> 15:23.500
Yeah.

15:27.709 --> 15:30.208
Mira, what about you?

15:33.917 --> 15:36.458
Um, sorry, what was the...

15:36.542 --> 15:38.667
DANIELLE: The question was about
your perception--

15:38.750 --> 15:41.959
Right. Our success. (LAUGHS)

15:42.041 --> 15:45.625
Um, well, I agree with what
Jonathan said.

15:45.709 --> 15:48.375
-I mean, we-- we come--
-(FOOTSTEPS)

15:48.458 --> 15:50.417
-Hi.
-Hey, honey.

15:50.500 --> 15:53.417
-Hey, oh. What is it?
-Whoa!

15:53.500 --> 15:55.166
-Hi.
-DANIELLE: Hi.

15:55.250 --> 15:57.250
-I'm Danielle. Remember me?
-Who's that?

15:57.333 --> 15:59.750
-What's wrong, honey bunny?
-It's over.

16:00.542 --> 16:01.959
Oh. Okay.

16:02.041 --> 16:03.500
-Sorry, give us a second.
-DANIELLE: Of course.

16:03.583 --> 16:05.166
Come on. I'll put another one
on for you, okay?

16:05.250 --> 16:07.375
-DANIELLE: Take your time,
no worries.
-AVA: Why can't I watch it

16:07.458 --> 16:08.500
here with you on the iPad?

16:08.583 --> 16:09.917
-We'll be right back.
-Because, silly goose,

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
we're having a little meeting,
but then-- It's okay.

16:12.083 --> 16:13.542
I'm just-- I'm gonna stay
with her and watch.

16:13.625 --> 16:15.083
I got it, I got it.
I got it, sweetie.

16:15.166 --> 16:17.166
-No, I'm gonna--
-You're in the middle
of your answer.

16:17.250 --> 16:19.166
Yeah, but I'm dying to get this
over with. Come on. I'm--

16:19.250 --> 16:21.125
I know, but it's just
gonna be a little longer.

16:21.208 --> 16:22.959
-She said an hour at the most.
-AVA LEVY: Daddy.

16:23.041 --> 16:24.375
Okay, sweetie,
I'm gonna put it on.

16:24.458 --> 16:25.583
What's wrong?

16:26.417 --> 16:27.542
Nothing.

16:28.917 --> 16:30.709
Have fun.

16:30.792 --> 16:33.625
JONATHAN: Okay.
Just one second, patience.

16:33.709 --> 16:35.792
-Sorry about that.
-No, no, it's fine.

16:35.875 --> 16:38.208
-I know exactly how it is.
-(CHUCKLES) Yeah.

16:38.291 --> 16:40.417
I'm so grateful
to you both for doing this.

16:40.500 --> 16:44.458
It's so hard finding subjects
for research,

16:44.542 --> 16:46.083
especially straight men,
actually.

16:46.166 --> 16:47.583
Well, lucky for you,
Jonathan loves

16:47.667 --> 16:50.041
-talking about his theories.
-Hmm.

16:50.125 --> 16:51.417
Well, what's yours?

16:54.166 --> 16:55.959
Well, um...

16:56.041 --> 16:58.000
I think about it in terms of...

16:59.166 --> 17:01.000
an equilibrium.

17:01.083 --> 17:03.291
-DANIELLE: Mm-hmm.
-Yeah. I think that

17:03.375 --> 17:06.667
in marriage, there is
this very delicate equilibrium

17:06.750 --> 17:10.166
and that, um, you have to
maintain it together.

17:12.208 --> 17:14.625
DANIELLE: And what
do you mean by equilibrium?

17:16.125 --> 17:18.458
Well, you know, at the beginning
of a relationship,

17:18.542 --> 17:20.125
everything's thrilling
and it's new

17:20.208 --> 17:22.250
and you feel as a couple
that nothing can hurt you.

17:22.333 --> 17:23.500
Right.

17:23.583 --> 17:25.917
And then you gradually
start to realize that actually,

17:26.000 --> 17:29.125
anything can hurt you.

17:30.291 --> 17:33.208
-Mm-hmm.
-(IPAD PLAYING INDISTINCTLY)

17:36.458 --> 17:37.667
Uh...

17:39.375 --> 17:41.834
-I'm gonna go check on them.
-DANIELLE: Okay.

17:41.917 --> 17:43.792
-I'll be right back.
-DANIELLE: Sure.

17:44.750 --> 17:46.083
-MIRA: Hey.
-Good? Yeah.

17:46.166 --> 17:48.709
Sorry, the Wi-Fi was,
uh, messed up.

17:48.792 --> 17:50.125
It wasn't loading.

17:50.667 --> 17:52.041
Hi.

17:52.125 --> 17:54.750
We have another half an hour
while she watches this one.

17:54.834 --> 17:56.750
-Perfect.
-Okay. All right.

17:56.834 --> 17:58.000
Okay. Great.

17:58.625 --> 17:59.709
Thank you.

18:00.208 --> 18:01.667
So...

18:01.750 --> 18:05.458
Yes, I'd like to hear about
your attitudes towards monogamy.

18:05.542 --> 18:07.625
Um, to what extent do you see
yourselves committed

18:07.709 --> 18:09.125
to each other exclusively?

18:09.208 --> 18:10.834
Well, what do you mean?

18:10.917 --> 18:12.041
DANIELLE: I mean sexually.

18:12.625 --> 18:14.625
(LAUGHTER)

18:14.709 --> 18:17.208
JONATHAN: I would say
it was very unexpected.

18:17.291 --> 18:19.417
(LAUGHTER CONTINUES)

18:19.500 --> 18:22.333
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

18:22.417 --> 18:25.083
Well? What did I miss?

18:25.166 --> 18:27.375
-MIRA: Oh, God.
-KATE: Basically, she asked

18:27.458 --> 18:29.959
if they're fucking other people.

18:30.041 --> 18:32.083
-That's a little intrusive, no?
-Yeah.

18:32.166 --> 18:33.792
-KATE: Why?
-Well, maybe not for you,

18:33.875 --> 18:35.542
but how did you agree
to do this?

18:35.625 --> 18:38.083
I didn't. Jonathan agreed,
and he dragged me into it.

18:38.166 --> 18:39.625
JONATHAN:
I didn't drag you into it.

18:39.709 --> 18:41.500
-You did. Yes.
-No, I didn't.

18:41.583 --> 18:44.000
MIRA: You did. He met her
at Ava's preschool.

18:44.083 --> 18:45.333
-Hmm.
-Yeah.

18:45.417 --> 18:47.125
For the twins, she takes care
of the twins that go there.

18:47.208 --> 18:48.917
So she told him all about it,

18:49.000 --> 18:50.875
and he couldn't help advancing
his theories

18:50.959 --> 18:52.458
on how capitalism
ruins marriages.

18:52.542 --> 18:53.667
-(LAUGHTER)
-JONATHAN: It's true.

18:53.750 --> 18:55.333
-Jonathan.
-Word needs to get out.

18:55.417 --> 18:57.583
Getting friendly with
the younger women at pickup?

18:57.667 --> 18:59.125
-JONATHAN: Come on.
-Uh-huh.

18:59.208 --> 19:01.083
-MIRA: That is true.
-He's taking advantage
of his sexy dad factor.

19:01.166 --> 19:03.792
She's a student.
She's a student. Please.

19:03.875 --> 19:06.083
PETER: But, wait,
what is the research about?

19:06.166 --> 19:08.667
JONATHAN: I'm kidding.
I'm totally kidding.

19:08.750 --> 19:10.291
I think that-- I think

19:10.375 --> 19:12.792
her thesis is basically that

19:12.875 --> 19:15.000
when the woman
is the primary provider

19:15.083 --> 19:16.792
and the man
is the primary caregiver,

19:16.875 --> 19:19.625
the marriage has
a greater chance of "success."

19:19.709 --> 19:21.000
-KATE: Mm.
-PETER: Really?

19:21.083 --> 19:22.250
JONATHAN: Yeah.

19:22.333 --> 19:24.375
Apparently, there's research
that says that the woman's

19:24.458 --> 19:27.041
level of satisfaction
is the crucial element

19:27.125 --> 19:29.625
in determining the long-term
stability of a marriage.

19:29.709 --> 19:31.375
PETER: Huh. You hear that, Kate?

19:31.458 --> 19:34.291
-Loud and clear.
-(LAUGHTER)

19:34.375 --> 19:36.417
PETER: Anyway,
why is she choosing

19:36.500 --> 19:39.041
to follow long-term
monogamous couples?

19:39.125 --> 19:41.375
I would expect more out of
a millennial psych student.

19:41.458 --> 19:43.500
-(KATE AND MIRA WHISPERING)
-JONATHAN: Yeah, apparently, uh,

19:43.583 --> 19:45.291
divorce has been researched
to death, so...

19:45.375 --> 19:47.542
Yeah, but there's so many
other relationship models.

19:47.625 --> 19:48.792
I mean, it's a new era.

19:48.875 --> 19:50.875
-(WOMEN WHISPER, LAUGH)
-PETER: Take us, for example.

19:50.959 --> 19:53.625
-She should have met with us.
-Yeah. Well, you know, I'm happy
to give her your number, Peter,

19:53.709 --> 19:55.792
if you're interested, as she's
desperate for research subjects.

19:55.875 --> 19:57.917
By all means. I think she could
benefit a lot from us.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.208
Wait. But she's interested in
successful marriages.

20:00.291 --> 20:03.041
I think that rules us out, baby.

20:03.125 --> 20:05.417
-That's...
-(KATE LAUGHS)

20:05.500 --> 20:07.041
I don't think that's true.

20:08.291 --> 20:10.125
Okay. Hey. I'm sorry.

20:12.625 --> 20:15.417
Wait. So how was,
uh, how was Boulder?

20:15.500 --> 20:16.750
-Oh, yeah.
-PETER: It was good.

20:16.834 --> 20:18.208
We-- we won the pitch.

20:18.291 --> 20:19.500
-Hey, that's great.
-No!

20:19.583 --> 20:22.542
-Cheers. Congrats. Fantastic.
-KATE: Thank you, guys.

20:22.625 --> 20:24.375
PETER:
Yeah, actually, we killed it.

20:24.458 --> 20:25.750
You know, I don't think
they were, uh,

20:25.834 --> 20:27.750
looking for a boutique company,

20:27.834 --> 20:30.125
but they fell in love
with Kate's demos.

20:30.208 --> 20:31.542
Of course they did.
She's a genius.

20:31.625 --> 20:33.709
There's no better web designer
on the entire East Coast.

20:33.792 --> 20:34.917
-No.
-MIRA: I've said that

20:35.000 --> 20:36.333
-multiple times.
-PETER: No argument here.

20:36.417 --> 20:39.250
And, you know, I didn't fuck up
the presentation too badly, so.

20:39.333 --> 20:41.166
-Well, good. Good on you.
-You sure? You sure?

20:41.250 --> 20:43.250
KATE: We were
a well-oiled machine.

20:43.333 --> 20:45.583
-(MIRA LAUGHS)
-(PETER LAUGHS)

20:45.667 --> 20:49.208
That's great, guys.
I'm jealous of you.

20:49.291 --> 20:51.583
I am. I get jealous of them.
I just think that, like,

20:51.667 --> 20:53.625
a couple that can
work together is--

20:53.709 --> 20:55.000
Don't be too jealous.

20:55.083 --> 20:57.542
JONATHAN: No, I'm sure it's not
always easy, but when it works,

20:57.625 --> 21:00.625
-that's like the paradigm.
-Easy? I mean, the fact that

21:00.709 --> 21:04.333
we got through Boulder without
killing each other is a miracle.

21:04.417 --> 21:06.250
Let's not do this now, Kate.

21:06.333 --> 21:08.792
-KATE: Why not?
What's the problem?
-This is not the time for it.

21:08.875 --> 21:12.625
Okay. So, when we're alone,
it's not the time either.

21:12.709 --> 21:14.959
Maybe you can give some thought
to when the right time might be.

21:15.041 --> 21:16.875
-Just stop, okay?
-KATE: Okay. Fine.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.500
Okay. Let's go home.

21:20.583 --> 21:23.208
-No! What are you talking about?
-We're playing make-believe.

21:23.291 --> 21:25.041
-PETER: Kate. Let's not ruin it.
-Don't leave.

21:25.125 --> 21:27.458
-What's going on, Peter?
-It's nothing important,

21:27.542 --> 21:29.458
it's just the usual
drama about...

21:29.542 --> 21:32.000
KATE: Don't say it's not
important. No. Fuck you.

21:32.083 --> 21:33.083
(SIGHS)

21:35.625 --> 21:36.917
Okay. (SNIFFLES)

21:37.542 --> 21:38.875
What's going on...

21:40.250 --> 21:42.333
is Nathan broke up with me,

21:42.417 --> 21:44.291
and I'm extremely depressed
about it.

21:47.583 --> 21:50.083
Peter can't deal with it.
He won't talk about it.

21:51.166 --> 21:52.667
So that's what's going on. And--

21:52.750 --> 21:54.500
-PETER: Kate. Cut it out.
-Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh.

21:54.583 --> 21:56.750
Cut it out?
You cut it out. All of these--

21:56.834 --> 21:59.834
I'm so sick of this
social fascism.

21:59.917 --> 22:02.750
-Social fascism.
-KATE: All these bullshit
empty conversations.

22:02.834 --> 22:04.375
I'm allowed
to talk about everything

22:04.458 --> 22:06.208
but the most important thing
going on in my life.

22:06.291 --> 22:07.750
I'm not gonna do it anymore.

22:09.083 --> 22:11.375
PETER: Maybe they don't really
feel like hearing about it,

22:11.458 --> 22:13.125
-have you considered that?
-KATE: No, no.

22:13.208 --> 22:15.583
You're the only one that doesn't
wanna hear about it.

22:15.667 --> 22:19.709
Because you'd rather wallow
in your passive-aggressive
bullshit resentment,

22:19.792 --> 22:22.792
you can't
admit that you're hurting,

22:22.875 --> 22:24.250
that it hurts,

22:24.333 --> 22:26.542
-and just talk to me about it.
-Yeah, I'm hurt, okay?

22:26.625 --> 22:28.417
I'm very hurt. I admit it. Okay.

22:28.500 --> 22:30.750
-Can we end this now?
-Okay. No, we can't end this.

22:30.834 --> 22:33.166
And I won't live like this.
Okay?

22:34.291 --> 22:36.250
When we started this, we said

22:36.333 --> 22:38.875
that we would talk about
everything, and I was there

22:38.959 --> 22:41.166
through all your shit
with Alana, Grace.

22:41.250 --> 22:43.542
I accepted that.
I dealt with that.

22:43.625 --> 22:45.750
And now suddenly
when I'm the one that's going
through something,

22:45.834 --> 22:47.875
it's like
my feelings aren't legitimate.

22:47.959 --> 22:49.583
I never fell in love
with anyone else.

22:49.667 --> 22:50.834
That's the difference.

22:53.458 --> 22:54.625
KATE: Okay.

22:55.667 --> 22:59.125
So what if I... fell in love?

22:59.208 --> 23:03.500
That was supposed to be a part
of the risk we both accepted.

23:04.500 --> 23:07.208
I'm not leaving, I'm here,
I'm dealing with it.

23:13.625 --> 23:16.250
-Sorry.
-It's okay. No, no, no.

23:16.333 --> 23:17.875
-Oh, God.
-JONATHAN: It's all right.

23:19.542 --> 23:21.291
So you care more about
what they think about you

23:21.375 --> 23:23.125
than what I'm going through
right now.

23:23.208 --> 23:25.166
-You're so pathetic.
-I think it's a real competition

23:25.250 --> 23:26.458
as to who's most pathetic
right now.

23:26.542 --> 23:28.875
MIRA: Let's take a break.
I'm gonna go upstairs.

23:28.959 --> 23:30.667
Why don't you come upstairs
with me?

23:31.959 --> 23:34.709
I'm gonna call a car.
You do whatever you want.

23:36.041 --> 23:37.125
-Hey.
-I'm sorry.

23:37.208 --> 23:38.542
-No, no.
-I couldn't hold it
together anymore.

23:38.625 --> 23:40.417
-MIRA: I get it.
-That whole dinner,
he was just...

23:40.500 --> 23:42.000
I know.

23:42.083 --> 23:44.125
It's been like this all week
since I talked to you.

23:44.208 --> 23:46.166
MIRA: I'm sorry
I haven't been here.

23:46.250 --> 23:48.667
-When did your flight get in?
-MIRA: Last night.

23:48.750 --> 23:50.750
Do you have an Advil?
My head's killing me.

23:50.834 --> 23:53.083
In my bathroom. I'm just gonna
check on Ava for a second.

23:53.166 --> 23:54.333
I'll be right there.

23:54.417 --> 23:56.917
(PETER AND JONATHAN
SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)

23:57.000 --> 23:58.667
PETER:
Revisionist history, you know?

23:58.750 --> 24:01.583
She was a mess,
I was holding things together.

24:01.667 --> 24:03.333
(SCOFFS)

24:04.125 --> 24:05.750
-Did you find it?
-Yeah.

24:11.375 --> 24:15.000
So, it ended with Nathan,
completely?

24:15.083 --> 24:16.375
Yeah. For good.

24:16.458 --> 24:19.000
-I'm sorry.
-(CHUCKLES)

24:19.083 --> 24:22.041
Oh, girl. Yeah.
He said he's exhausted

24:23.125 --> 24:25.333
from living a double life.

24:25.417 --> 24:27.333
The irony is a double life's
the only life

24:27.417 --> 24:28.750
I know how to live.

24:29.333 --> 24:30.500
Right.

24:30.583 --> 24:32.834
KATE: Mira, this past week,
I can barely get out of bed.

24:32.917 --> 24:36.000
Literally.
It's not getting any better.

24:36.083 --> 24:39.333
And Peter just sulks all day
like a child. And...

24:39.417 --> 24:42.834
(SIGHS) When he's not doing
this phony chipper thing

24:42.917 --> 24:45.625
that makes me
wanna strangle him.

24:45.709 --> 24:48.125
And then I have these outbursts
of hatred for him

24:48.208 --> 24:49.542
where I'm just...

24:51.875 --> 24:53.250
I find myself in bed...

24:54.750 --> 24:57.291
thinking of the craziest ways
to torture him

24:57.959 --> 24:59.959
and then fucking kill him.

25:01.333 --> 25:02.917
-I don't know.
-Mm-hmm.

25:03.000 --> 25:08.208
Perhaps it's time to reconsider
this arrangement.

25:08.291 --> 25:09.417
This arrangement?

25:09.500 --> 25:11.458
(EXHALES) I'm--

25:11.542 --> 25:13.375
You gotta remember
this whole thing started

25:13.458 --> 25:15.417
so Peter could justify
his cheating.

25:15.500 --> 25:17.709
This is just-- It doesn't matter
how it started.

25:17.792 --> 25:21.041
This is the way that we found
to, you know, get through it,

25:21.125 --> 25:22.750
and I don't regret it.

25:23.208 --> 25:24.417
MIRA: Mm.

25:25.792 --> 25:26.792
KATE: I don't.

25:26.875 --> 25:28.917
-I don't-- Kate.
-KATE: It's been good for us.

25:29.000 --> 25:32.291
I don't remember ever wanting
to fuck Peter

25:32.375 --> 25:34.792
as much as
when I was with Nathan.

25:34.875 --> 25:37.917
I'm serious. I wore him out.

25:38.041 --> 25:39.792
-MIRA: Okay.
-Do you know how good it felt

25:39.875 --> 25:42.291
to actually want my husband?

25:46.333 --> 25:49.083
You know, this is real.

25:49.166 --> 25:51.667
This is my life, Mira.
It's not some whim.

25:53.166 --> 25:54.500
I mean, what I had with Nathan,

25:54.583 --> 25:58.208
I don't remember
ever feeling so alive.

25:58.291 --> 26:03.250
And so, okay, it also means
feeling this terrible pain.

26:03.333 --> 26:04.667
It's part of the deal.

26:11.667 --> 26:13.834
You're really
suffering though, honey.

26:14.709 --> 26:15.834
Hmm.

26:17.500 --> 26:19.000
What would be better?

26:20.208 --> 26:21.458
There were at least three years

26:21.542 --> 26:23.542
when I didn't have sex
with Peter.

26:23.625 --> 26:25.041
-MIRA: I know.
-Yeah.

26:26.291 --> 26:28.291
Does that seem
reasonable to you?

26:28.375 --> 26:30.792
Life without any passion,
right? Kind of like--

26:30.875 --> 26:33.667
Well, passion, okay,
it's awesome,

26:33.750 --> 26:35.959
uh, but, you know,
it's not sustainable.

26:36.041 --> 26:37.417
We're not 16 anymore.
You can't--

26:37.500 --> 26:38.792
What does 16
have to do with anything?

26:38.875 --> 26:40.417
Did you renounce passion
at the age of 16?

26:40.500 --> 26:42.250
No, I'm not saying
that I renounced it.

26:42.333 --> 26:43.917
KATE: Don't start quoting
Jonathan's theories

26:44.000 --> 26:46.542
-about marriage.
-I'm not quoting him.

26:46.625 --> 26:51.375
No, I-- I'm saying that, okay,
this open relationship

26:51.458 --> 26:53.959
-comes at a price for everybody.
-Of course it does.

26:54.041 --> 26:57.250
And... it can't be easy
for your kids, right?

26:59.542 --> 27:03.166
Well, it's not easy
for any kid, Mira.

27:03.250 --> 27:04.458
I mean...

27:07.375 --> 27:10.458
Honestly, in the long run,
I think that it's actually...

27:11.417 --> 27:12.959
very empowering for them

27:13.041 --> 27:17.041
to see me always searching
for freedom and happiness.

27:18.875 --> 27:21.583
I don't know,
self-actualization?

27:24.000 --> 27:26.458
It's absolutely something
that I want to model for them.

27:27.417 --> 27:28.750
Especially Anna.

27:32.834 --> 27:34.125
Okay.

27:37.083 --> 27:39.208
I'm not judging you, honey.
I'm not.

27:39.291 --> 27:40.291
Yeah.

27:42.917 --> 27:45.667
MIRA: And I'm on your side
always. You know that, right?

27:47.333 --> 27:49.125
I know. I do.

27:51.625 --> 27:53.375
I'm sorry. Here.

27:53.458 --> 27:56.083
-Mm.
-KATE: No, no, no.

27:56.166 --> 27:58.291
(KATE EXHALES SHAKILY)

28:00.125 --> 28:01.583
KATE: Hmm.

28:01.667 --> 28:02.959
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

28:03.041 --> 28:06.792
Oh, this day. It's just, like,
it's so much. It's...

28:10.041 --> 28:11.625
Wait, is something wrong?

28:14.125 --> 28:15.959
No, it's just, uh...

28:18.291 --> 28:21.250
It's just a lot of pressure, so.

28:22.125 --> 28:23.667
What kind of pressure?

28:26.667 --> 28:29.000
No, it's nothing. Forget it.

28:33.875 --> 28:35.667
(LAUGHS) What?

28:37.458 --> 28:40.625
Nothing, I just--
I'm sorry I lost it.

28:40.709 --> 28:43.041
(LAUGHS)

28:43.125 --> 28:45.709
I think it's okay.
That was crazy.

28:46.834 --> 28:47.834
KATE: Girl.

28:49.542 --> 28:52.667
-You're such a good friend. Hey.
-Aw.

28:53.458 --> 28:54.709
And you're stunning.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.208
KATE: I don't... (LAUGHS)

29:12.291 --> 29:14.625
-Not sure where what came from.
-(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

29:14.709 --> 29:16.375
KATE: I think I'm pretty drunk.

29:19.208 --> 29:20.375
MIRA: Um...

29:21.750 --> 29:23.583
-KATE: Okay. You good?
-Yeah.

29:23.667 --> 29:26.041
-Do you wanna go downstairs?
-Okay.

29:26.125 --> 29:30.000
-Mm. Yeah.
-(MIRA LAUGHS)

29:31.709 --> 29:32.625
KATE: Hang on.

29:32.709 --> 29:34.041
-Okay, come on.
-KATE: Okay.

29:35.125 --> 29:36.375
(EXHALES)

29:37.792 --> 29:39.792
PETER: Oh, no, no, no,
you got it backwards.

29:39.875 --> 29:42.041
It was-- it was-- it was she
who made the sale.

29:42.125 --> 29:44.291

she's a true artist, right?

in Brookline.

PETER: When I sleep with
other women, it's because, uh,

30:07.083 --> 30:09.458
it's only because
it makes me feel...

30:10.458 --> 30:12.166
You know, it's--
it has nothing to do

30:12.250 --> 30:15.333
with falling in love.
It's the only way--

30:15.417 --> 30:18.041
It's the only way
that I can, uh...

30:18.125 --> 30:19.291
JONATHAN: No, it does--

30:19.375 --> 30:20.875
PETER: You know, I know--
I know I'm the one who--

30:20.959 --> 30:23.208
Peter, I called us a car.
Neither one of us can drive.

30:23.291 --> 30:27.166
-PETER: Mm-hmm. Yeah.
-JONATHAN: Do you want coffee
or anything?

30:27.250 --> 30:29.208
-KATE: Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm good. Yeah.

30:29.291 --> 30:31.000
Yeah, I was just, uh...

30:31.083 --> 30:32.709
I was just trying
to explain to him

30:32.792 --> 30:36.083
how you and I decided to, uh...

30:36.166 --> 30:39.583
And I, you know, I was saying
that just ignoring the fact

30:39.667 --> 30:42.333
that you have options
doesn't make them go away.

30:42.417 --> 30:43.500
-Right? Right?
-KATE: Yeah.

30:43.583 --> 30:45.583

of saying it is,

30:45.667 --> 30:48.208
you know, if the only reason
that you're faithful

30:48.291 --> 30:51.041
is because it's like
a rational decision,

30:51.125 --> 30:53.250
-well, that's not sustainable.
-Why not?

30:53.333 --> 30:55.458

of the right woman, right time

30:55.542 --> 30:57.458
-when it finally happens, right?
-JONATHAN: Oh, okay.

30:57.542 --> 30:59.375

in the matter?

30:59.458 --> 31:00.709

You understand what I'm saying?

It depends on who you are.

31:14.500 --> 31:16.125

-Shh. Peter.

it's a longer conversation.

31:19.333 --> 31:20.834
No, tell me, I wanna hear.

31:23.500 --> 31:25.917
I think maybe it's just because
of the way that I was raised.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.583
-PETER: What do you mean?
-Well, you know, in...

31:28.667 --> 31:30.917
the first 20 years of your life,

31:31.000 --> 31:34.083
you're taught to conquer
your desires,

31:34.166 --> 31:36.208
-not surrender to them.
-Dude.

31:36.291 --> 31:38.625
-JONATHAN: What?
-That's grotesque.

31:38.709 --> 31:39.750

31:39.834 --> 31:41.500
I mean,
that level of repression,

31:41.583 --> 31:42.667
it's like from the Middle Ages.

JONATHAN: I'm not defending it.

31:43.834 --> 31:45.250
I'm just saying
that it's ingrained in me.

Hey, babe, where is your jacket?

31:48.166 --> 31:50.583
You really need
to start shaking that off.

-Or it's gonna take
a major toll on you.
-KATE: Peter.

41:18.208 --> 41:22.250
could be completely happy
and confident about this--

41:22.333 --> 41:24.834
Yeah, but-- that's because I see
how ambivalent you are about it.

41:24.917 --> 41:27.333
-Well, yeah.
Of course I'm ambivalent.
-JONATHAN: Yeah.

41:27.417 --> 41:29.333

those first two years with Ava?

41:29.417 --> 41:30.959
-Yeah.
-Thinking about jumping back

41:31.041 --> 41:32.125

you've been an amazing partner,

you couldn't, like--

I couldn't-- I couldn't be

41:39.458 --> 41:40.583
-where you were.
-No, you could not.

in your place. I know.

41:44.458 --> 41:45.625
But you couldn't.

I was just awful to you.
I was awful.

41:52.792 --> 41:54.792

That's why you become distant,
and I hated you

42:03.542 --> 42:06.125

myself even more for...

42:06.792 --> 42:08.500
being so shitty to you.

42:23.917 --> 42:26.000
feel like myself again,
you know?

42:26.083 --> 42:27.834
And now we're good, and...

we had no perspective at all.

gonna be like that forever.

You know, Ava's totally obsessed
with having a little sister.

-If it's....

44:03.458 --> 44:04.750

44:04.834 --> 44:07.208
Well, it'll have to
be a girl then.

We'll raise it a girl,
regardless.

their own rooms eventually.
