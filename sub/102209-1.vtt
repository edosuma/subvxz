WEBVTT

00:15.885 --> 00:18.583
[wind whistling]

01:19.340 --> 01:20.950
- You boys are heading
down John strobe

01:20.993 --> 01:22.169
about three quarters of a mile,

01:22.212 --> 01:23.474
make sure you keep to the right.

01:23.518 --> 01:25.694
- Yeah, man, for the beans?

01:25.737 --> 01:28.218
Look at this dirty
jug of syrup, Benny.

01:28.262 --> 01:29.828
- We need some onions
to go with those, too.

01:29.872 --> 01:30.829
Where's Miller?

01:30.873 --> 01:32.222
Miller!

01:32.266 --> 01:33.223
- Miller, grab some onions!

01:33.267 --> 01:35.617
- I'm busy, get Mark to help.

01:35.660 --> 01:38.098
- Mark, quit playing with your
thing and grab some onions!

01:38.141 --> 01:39.316
- [Man] Don't go to the left.

01:39.360 --> 01:40.230
You'll get into
trouble down there.

01:40.274 --> 01:41.797
- [Miller] Okay, right, gotcha.

01:41.840 --> 01:44.843
[crickets chirping]

01:50.327 --> 01:52.547
- You'll be lucky if you
get service out here.

01:52.590 --> 01:53.896
- Yeah?

01:53.939 --> 01:55.854
- Yeah, it sucks.

01:55.898 --> 01:56.942
Not like in the city.

02:00.859 --> 02:03.210
So, who you talkin' to?

02:05.821 --> 02:08.171
- Do you go to Northumberland?

02:08.215 --> 02:11.218
I actually wanted to go there
so badly, I was this close.

02:12.219 --> 02:13.263
What program do you go to?

02:13.307 --> 02:14.438
- Fine arts.

02:14.482 --> 02:15.439
I actually just
finished the third year.

02:15.483 --> 02:16.397
- No way, really?

02:16.440 --> 02:17.789
I was gonna take the same thing.

02:17.833 --> 02:18.573
- Really?
- Yeah.

02:18.616 --> 02:19.487
You like the program?

02:19.530 --> 02:20.618
- I love it, it's amazing.

02:20.662 --> 02:22.316
Just the energy there.

02:22.359 --> 02:24.318
Are you an artist?

02:24.361 --> 02:28.148
- Oh, well I guess you
could say I used to be,

02:28.191 --> 02:30.237
but no, I just dabble.

02:32.195 --> 02:33.196
I dunno.

02:34.415 --> 02:37.592
I guess I just sort of
lost touch of the dream.

02:38.636 --> 02:39.507
You know?

02:39.550 --> 02:41.117
- Is that why you didn't go?

02:41.161 --> 02:42.249
- University?
- Yeah.

02:43.685 --> 02:47.341
- Yeah, no, that
and other reasons.

02:47.384 --> 02:48.864
You know, life got in the way.

02:50.996 --> 02:52.563
Wow, that sounded like a cliche.

02:52.607 --> 02:54.348
I'm so sorry.

02:54.391 --> 02:56.350
- It's not if that's
what happened.

02:56.393 --> 02:58.178
It's too bad, though.

02:58.221 --> 02:59.744
We might have met
each other there.

02:59.788 --> 03:04.749
- Yeah, yeah we would've,
could've been neighbors.

03:04.793 --> 03:06.534
- Oh, definitely neighbors.

03:06.577 --> 03:08.144
We would've met in front
of our doors, you know,

03:08.188 --> 03:10.233
thought the other one was cute.

03:10.277 --> 03:11.756
- Cute?

03:11.800 --> 03:12.975
- Yeah, started hanging out,
going to classes together.

03:13.018 --> 03:15.282
- Wait, wait, cute?
- We'd study together.

03:15.325 --> 03:17.022
- We'd go to social
events together.

03:17.066 --> 03:18.459
- Practically inseparable.

03:18.502 --> 03:20.417
Get in over our heads,
too much, too fast.

03:20.461 --> 03:21.723
- Oh, that's a bad thing?

03:21.766 --> 03:23.072
- Eventually we'd
decide that our art

03:23.115 --> 03:24.465
was more important than
our budding friendship.

03:24.508 --> 03:25.292
- [Mark] No, I don't like
the way this is going.

03:25.335 --> 03:27.424
- Then we'd just drift apart.

03:27.468 --> 03:29.600
- Well that's a horrible ending.

03:29.644 --> 03:32.081
- Until the next summer
when we meet randomly

03:32.124 --> 03:35.345
at a vegetable stand in the
middle of nowhere, maybe.

03:35.389 --> 03:36.433
- Much better.

03:41.438 --> 03:42.483
Okay, I have to ask.

03:44.006 --> 03:47.618
What is an arts major doing
in the middle of nowhere

03:47.662 --> 03:50.186
selling vegetables out
of the back of her truck?

03:50.969 --> 03:51.753
- Ugh.

03:55.017 --> 03:57.367
I was working like
a maniac in the city

03:57.411 --> 03:59.848
to pay for university,
and I had to get away.

04:01.066 --> 04:04.374
Just needed to get
recharged, you know?

04:04.418 --> 04:05.854
Back to center?

04:05.897 --> 04:09.205
So I decided to stay with
my grandparents for a bit.

04:09.249 --> 04:11.947
Grandpa says that change
is as good as a rest.

04:11.990 --> 04:13.688
Grandparents are so smart.

04:13.731 --> 04:15.429
Plus, you know, I like
to help my grandma

04:15.472 --> 04:17.474
with the garden
this time of year.

04:17.518 --> 04:19.868
Stuff grows and ripens
faster than you can pick it,

04:19.911 --> 04:23.785
and there's no way you can can
it all, it's just too much.

04:23.828 --> 04:26.440
So here I am, selling peaches.

04:28.572 --> 04:29.921
- More beer?

04:29.965 --> 04:31.053
- Well, I figured
while we were here,

04:31.096 --> 04:33.185
one more six pack wouldn't hurt.

04:33.229 --> 04:35.187
Did you actually bring
your sleeping bag in here?

04:35.231 --> 04:37.015
- I didn't bring my
sleeping bag in here.

04:37.059 --> 04:39.279
I forgot mine and Benny's
buying me a new one.

04:39.322 --> 04:40.497
- Why would Benny
buy you a new one?

04:40.541 --> 04:41.846
- Because Miller forgot
his wallet again.

04:41.890 --> 04:42.673
- Yep.

04:43.979 --> 04:45.328
- No, no, no, you know what?

04:45.372 --> 04:46.982
I got this.

04:47.025 --> 04:49.463
You guys have been covering
all week, I'll pay, I'll pay.

04:49.506 --> 04:51.073
- Thanks, buddy.

04:51.116 --> 04:53.597
- Boys it'll be cash only
today, there's no debit here.

04:53.641 --> 04:55.860
- Well, one of us is prepared.

04:55.904 --> 04:56.687
Benny, you're up.

04:57.558 --> 04:58.341
Buddy.

04:59.821 --> 05:01.344
- So, what about you?

05:01.388 --> 05:04.216
Besides not helping me
through art history classes.

05:05.566 --> 05:07.350
Headed up to the lakes for
the weekend, obviously.

05:07.394 --> 05:10.397
- Yeah, yeah, just a little
bit of fishing, you know?

05:10.440 --> 05:12.486
Nice quiet weekend
away with the lads.

05:12.529 --> 05:14.879
[men whooping]

05:14.923 --> 05:16.054
- Are those the lads?

05:16.098 --> 05:17.447
[Miller yells]

05:17.491 --> 05:18.883
- Hey.

05:18.927 --> 05:20.407
- Big dirty jug of
syrup for the beans!

05:20.450 --> 05:21.930
- Oh, cool man.

05:21.973 --> 05:23.279
- Oh hey pretty.

05:23.323 --> 05:24.541
- You guys should stock up

05:24.585 --> 05:26.326
on something special
for your weekend.

05:26.369 --> 05:28.415
- Coming with us, hey?

05:28.458 --> 05:29.590
- Funny.

05:29.633 --> 05:33.420
I have kale, I have
corn, I have lettuce,

05:33.463 --> 05:36.336
I have peaches, I have--

05:36.379 --> 05:37.772
- Thank you, Peaches.

05:38.903 --> 05:40.862
- So that's Train, he's awful.

05:40.905 --> 05:42.167
- Okay.

05:42.211 --> 05:43.212
- This truck is so
nice, is this yours?

05:43.255 --> 05:44.692
- It is, it was a sweet 16.

05:44.735 --> 05:45.475
It's my baby.

05:45.519 --> 05:47.347
- New posi track, man!

05:47.390 --> 05:49.087
- Grandpa wanted to make
sure no matter where I was

05:49.131 --> 05:51.481
in the world, that I'd always
have a safe way back home.

05:51.525 --> 05:55.355
Home is where you find
all the answers, you know?

05:55.398 --> 05:56.704
- Yeah, my cousin
had one like this.

05:56.747 --> 05:58.923
He brought it up
from North Carolina,

05:58.967 --> 06:01.317
never saw salted roads.

06:01.361 --> 06:02.753
Hey, did you have to
swap out the final drive

06:02.797 --> 06:04.059
to make it more
highway friendly?

06:04.102 --> 06:05.277
- Hey, that's a
cool story, Benny.

06:05.321 --> 06:06.322
When does it end?

06:07.932 --> 06:10.021
- Oh Mark, you know all
about these old trucks.

06:10.065 --> 06:10.848
- What?

06:15.636 --> 06:16.854
[both chuckle]

06:16.898 --> 06:18.116
So, '65 truck.

06:22.991 --> 06:23.774
- Buddy?

06:25.080 --> 06:26.516
- Hey, what do ya think?

06:26.560 --> 06:27.343
- Yeah man.

06:27.387 --> 06:28.083
- Not bad eh?

06:28.126 --> 06:29.127
Wonder Mark.

06:30.738 --> 06:31.608
- You know, we
should get a picture.

06:31.652 --> 06:32.609
- You're such a teenage girl.

06:32.653 --> 06:33.654
- Why do you want a picture?

06:33.697 --> 06:35.569
Sentimental Benny.

06:35.612 --> 06:37.353
- Memories for
the trip, come on.

06:37.397 --> 06:38.398
- Okay, selfie.

06:38.441 --> 06:39.399
- Cuddle in.

06:40.704 --> 06:41.575
What about Mark?

06:41.618 --> 06:42.445
- Hey Mark!

06:42.489 --> 06:43.664
Come on!

06:43.707 --> 06:44.578
- Think you're
needed over there.

06:44.621 --> 06:45.492
- I don't, don't make me go.

06:45.535 --> 06:47.798
- Mark, Mark!
- Mark!

06:47.842 --> 06:49.583
- Ah, you need to go.
- No, no, no.

06:49.626 --> 06:50.627
- Go for it.

06:53.500 --> 06:55.197
- Can you not chew
right in my ear?

06:58.635 --> 06:59.810
- Hey guys.

06:59.854 --> 07:01.290
- Hey buddy.

07:01.333 --> 07:03.161
Come on, don't spill the beer.

07:03.205 --> 07:03.988
- Here, let me take
it for you guys.

07:05.163 --> 07:08.515
- Yeah, let her take it.
- Thanks.

07:08.558 --> 07:10.473
- All right, smile.

07:12.606 --> 07:13.563
Beautiful.

07:13.607 --> 07:14.434
- Yes!

07:17.524 --> 07:18.829
One quick one of us, eh?

07:18.873 --> 07:20.788
What do you say,
come on, come on.

07:20.831 --> 07:22.442
Say peaches!

07:22.485 --> 07:23.747
- [Mark] Okay, all right.

07:23.791 --> 07:25.488
- That's actually
a really good one.

07:25.532 --> 07:27.490
Guys, come on, it
was just one picture.

07:27.534 --> 07:29.318
Dude, come on.

07:29.361 --> 07:30.972
- You're such a jackass.

07:31.015 --> 07:32.190
- [Train] Why am I a jackass?

07:32.234 --> 07:33.453
- Anyway, it was really
nice to meet you.

07:33.496 --> 07:37.239
- Yeah, sure.

07:37.282 --> 07:38.458
- Good luck with school.

07:38.501 --> 07:40.242
- Thank you.
- And, yeah.

07:41.939 --> 07:42.940
- Sorry about the animal.

07:42.984 --> 07:44.333
- Oh it's fine.

07:44.376 --> 07:47.467
- Pretty sure I got it then.
- No worries.

07:48.511 --> 07:49.991
Oh, hold up a minute?

07:52.559 --> 07:55.518
Can you give this
to your friend?

07:58.565 --> 08:01.437
Mr. Bashful, the cute one?

08:01.481 --> 08:02.220
- You got it.

08:02.264 --> 08:03.004
- Thanks.

08:03.047 --> 08:04.788
[Kat giggles]

08:04.832 --> 08:05.572
- Take care.

08:05.615 --> 08:06.616
- Yeah, you too.

08:06.660 --> 08:11.665

love those cutoffs.

08:34.601 --> 08:36.298

- No you didn't.
- Yeah I did, man.

08:37.517 --> 08:38.692
- You're a liar.

08:38.735 --> 08:39.954
- No, you guys
were turned around

- He's probably calling us
idiots right now, to be honest.

08:58.625 --> 08:59.887
- Well, Benny's stupid himself.

08:59.930 --> 09:01.192
- Stupid, man.

09:01.236 --> 09:02.629
- He drives a mini van.

09:02.672 --> 09:03.717

some lines in the water,

pick up your fishing license

make you trade in

will be really pleased

09:37.751 --> 09:38.969
to hear you say that.

me and Steph, buddy.

you out here the best I can,

and you didn't even notice.

09:49.327 --> 09:50.546

09:50.590 --> 09:51.591
- What?

wanted to say hi.

21:48.524 --> 21:49.395
- [Mark] Is anybody even here?

21:49.438 --> 21:51.658
- Well maybe they went fishing.

21:51.701 --> 21:54.138
- I don't think so, I think
that's their boat right there.

21:54.182 --> 21:55.314
- [Benny] Maybe they
got a second one.

21:55.357 --> 21:56.358
- I wanted to meet them!

21:56.402 --> 21:57.403
- Oh yeah you did.

21:57.446 --> 21:58.882
A couple of girls, fishin'--

21:58.926 --> 22:01.407
- Rockin' rough freakin'
A, girls and fish.

22:01.450 --> 22:02.930
Let's write 'em a note.

22:02.973 --> 22:05.759
Slippery sixes on ice,
guitar's out at eight, eh Mark?

22:05.802 --> 22:06.847
- Yeah, that's right.

22:06.890 --> 22:08.631
- Ooh, little cooler action.

22:08.675 --> 22:10.067
- [Mark] Hey guys, come on,
don't go through their stuff.

22:10.111 --> 22:11.678
- Hey!
- Oh ho ho!

22:11.721 --> 22:12.461
- Double O?

22:12.505 --> 22:14.071
My kind of ladies, woo!

22:14.115 --> 22:16.160
- Girls that drink
that stuff, classy.

22:16.204 --> 22:17.423
- We drink that stuff.

22:17.466 --> 22:18.424
- Yeah, exactly.

22:18.467 --> 22:19.903
[beer spritzes]

22:19.947 --> 22:22.166
- Seriously man, did you
just snag one of their beers?

22:22.210 --> 22:23.733
What's with everyone
helping themselves today?

22:23.777 --> 22:24.734
- [Train] I don't
even know why, man.

22:24.778 --> 22:26.475
Automatic, wasn't even thirsty.

22:28.303 --> 22:30.087
- Yo, let's get outta here

22:30.131 --> 22:32.829
before they think we're
robbin' 'em or something.

22:32.873 --> 22:34.570
- Guys, I'll replace the beer!

22:34.614 --> 22:36.485
Actually, I'll bring
two if they're babes.

22:36.529 --> 22:37.573
Actually know what,
forget the beer.

22:37.617 --> 22:38.574
Let's find the rye!

22:46.321 --> 22:48.454
All right Benny, show
us how it's done.

22:48.497 --> 22:49.977
- Yeah, that's
gotta be 45 yards.

22:50.020 --> 22:52.240
I need a shot or two if
you're gonna overcompensate.

22:52.283 --> 22:53.154
- No excuses.

22:53.197 --> 22:54.938
If you miss, you must drink.

22:54.982 --> 22:55.852
- Well that's stage one.

22:55.896 --> 22:57.288
At least try to hit this first.

22:57.332 --> 22:58.551
- Well, that'll be easy.

23:00.727 --> 23:01.467
[gun pops]

23:01.510 --> 23:02.424
- Yeah, that was esay.

23:02.468 --> 23:03.599
Now hit the frying pan there.

23:05.819 --> 23:09.039
- Whoa, grab the camera,
Benny sucks at something!

23:09.083 --> 23:09.823
- Drink!

23:14.044 --> 23:14.784
- There we go.

23:14.828 --> 23:15.698
- Bow to sensei, lads.

23:15.742 --> 23:17.308
- No, no, no, no, new rule.

23:17.352 --> 23:19.441
You hit that pan three times,
Miller finishes his beer.

23:19.485 --> 23:20.486
- Benny can't hit it anyway.

23:20.529 --> 23:21.704
- Ah, I'll do it right now.

23:21.748 --> 23:23.314
- No, no, no,
mandatory handicap.

23:23.358 --> 23:24.968
Pass it down, and then
you get back to it.

23:25.012 --> 23:27.667
- That's fair, got this
figured out anyway.

23:27.710 --> 23:28.581
- All right.
- All right.

23:28.624 --> 23:29.930
- Do I hit the can first?

23:29.973 --> 23:30.844
- [Train] Then the
one on the stump.

23:30.887 --> 23:31.758
- [Miller] Ah, raise the stakes.

23:31.801 --> 23:33.455
- Okay, so can, can, pan.

23:33.499 --> 23:38.417
- No no no no, can,
can, ax head, pan.

23:38.460 --> 23:39.548
- Yo, don't shoot my ax!

23:39.592 --> 23:40.767
- Arbitrary ruling
man, no overrides.

23:40.810 --> 23:43.117
- Frick, I hate
arbitrary ruling.

23:43.160 --> 23:45.119
Be careful, I sanded
that handle for hours.

23:45.162 --> 23:47.382
- Don't worry, I'm not
gonna hit it, I suck.

23:48.514 --> 23:50.733
[can pings]
- Oh!

23:50.777 --> 23:52.474

23:53.432 --> 23:55.259
Oh, maybe I don't suck!

23:56.217 --> 23:58.306
- Ax?
- Ax.

23:58.349 --> 23:59.699
[all shouting]

23:59.742 --> 24:00.613
- Yeah, you missed.
- I missed it.

24:00.656 --> 24:01.962
- You missed, pass it down.

24:02.005 --> 24:04.051
- Oh no, no, no, no, we
shoot at all the targets

24:04.094 --> 24:05.661
and then we drink
for each one we miss.

24:05.705 --> 24:06.575
- And then if we hit the pan,

24:06.619 --> 24:07.924
it should cancel out our misses.

24:07.968 --> 24:09.273
- Yeah.
- Well, and if you

24:09.317 --> 24:10.797
hit the pan three
times, we all drink.

24:10.840 --> 24:11.754
- Okay.

24:11.798 --> 24:13.103
- And Miller finishes his beer.

24:13.147 --> 24:14.235
- [Miller] No, we
all finish our beer.

24:14.278 --> 24:17.281
- Okay, they call me Mark

24:17.325 --> 24:19.370

24:20.459 --> 24:21.372

- Nope!

24:21.416 --> 24:24.071
- Two drinks.
- I lied to you.

24:24.114 --> 24:25.072
Two drinks.

24:25.115 --> 24:25.812
- All right.
- Batter up.

24:25.855 --> 24:27.248
- All right, one can.

24:27.291 --> 24:28.075
[can pings]

24:28.118 --> 24:28.815
- Oh!
- There's one.

24:28.858 --> 24:30.164
Second one.

24:30.207 --> 24:31.513

- Oh!

24:31.557 --> 24:33.254

24:33.297 --> 24:35.517
- Ha!
- Oh.

24:35.561 --> 24:37.127

pan, pan's easier.

24:38.128 --> 24:40.130

[all laugh]

24:40.174 --> 24:42.089

- Train wreck.

24:42.132 --> 24:43.525
- What?

24:43.569 --> 24:44.526
- You're the second guy to miss,

24:44.570 --> 24:45.962
therefore the
penalty is doubled.

24:46.006 --> 24:47.529
- That is so stupid!

24:47.573 --> 24:48.704
- It's an arbitrary ruling,
there's no overrides.

24:48.748 --> 24:51.054
- I hate arbitrary rulings!

24:51.098 --> 24:53.013
- Let me show you how
it's done, here we go.

24:54.449 --> 24:55.450
- Miller.

24:55.494 --> 24:56.233
[gun pops]

24:56.277 --> 24:57.539
- Oh wow, that was--

24:57.583 --> 24:58.322
- Can't even hit one.
- Really embarrassing.

24:58.366 --> 24:59.802
- That one didn't count.

24:59.846 --> 25:01.282
- Yo, two drink penalty for
missing the easy first one.

25:01.325 --> 25:03.937
No excuse for being
that crap, Mill.

25:03.980 --> 25:04.851
- Drink up.

25:04.894 --> 25:05.547
- That's incredibly fair.

25:07.027 --> 25:09.638
- Whoa, you can't get a
second attempt at the target!

25:09.682 --> 25:11.901
- Yes I can, I can't just
stop halfway through.

25:11.945 --> 25:13.555
It's gonna jinx the
whole damn thing.

25:13.599 --> 25:14.513
- That's true.

25:14.556 --> 25:15.688
- No no no no no, new ruling.

25:15.731 --> 25:17.385
If you miss the first one,

25:17.428 --> 25:19.561
then you have to
finish your drink.

25:19.605 --> 25:20.823
- Oh, I like it, no excuses.

25:20.867 --> 25:22.477
- That can come into
play next round.

25:22.521 --> 25:24.566

it in your neighbor's yard,

it'd be super tempting
to go over there

it won't take time,

51:11.372 --> 51:12.982
- Okay, this is ridiculous.

51:13.026 --> 51:14.462
He's obviously around
here somewhere, he's just,

51:14.506 --> 51:15.898
probably just hiding somewhere,

51:15.942 --> 51:17.944
waiting to jump
out and surprise us

51:17.987 --> 51:19.859
'cause he's being
a little weenie!

51:23.036 --> 51:24.255
- The island isn't that big.

51:25.734 --> 51:27.562
It's possible he went
swimming without telling us.

51:27.606 --> 51:29.999
Which is pretty stupid, but
I wouldn't put it past him.

51:30.043 --> 51:30.783
- Train!

51:32.437 --> 51:34.003
- Okay, we gotta
get out on the water

51:34.047 --> 51:35.614
and go around the island,

51:35.657 --> 51:38.617
make sure he hasn't dived off
and hit his head or something.

51:38.660 --> 51:39.792
- Guys, I'm getting
freaked out here.

51:39.835 --> 51:41.446
- Now just relax, Mill.

51:41.489 --> 51:42.751
Here's what we're gonna do.

51:42.795 --> 51:44.797
Mark and I will take the
canoe, we'll do a lap.

51:44.840 --> 51:46.364
I want you to search the
island one more time,

51:46.407 --> 51:48.017
and we'll meet in
the middle, okay?

51:48.061 --> 51:48.801
- Okay.

52:18.004 --> 52:19.092
- Train, Train!

52:22.400 --> 52:23.183
Train!

52:26.665 --> 52:27.448
- Train!

52:32.149 --> 52:33.150
- Train, Train!

52:39.025 --> 52:41.201
Train, where the heck are you?

52:41.245 --> 52:42.550
Come on, Train.

52:43.986 --> 52:45.031
Oh I'm gonna kill him.

52:46.380 --> 52:47.164
- Train!

52:52.212 --> 52:53.692
- Hey, choo choo!

53:14.974 --> 53:15.844
- [Miller] Nothin'?

53:15.888 --> 53:16.889
- [Mark] No, I guess you didn't

53:16.932 --> 53:17.933
see anything either, right?

53:17.977 --> 53:19.587
- [Miller] So what do we do now?

53:19.631 --> 53:20.632
- Let's just think about this.

53:20.675 --> 53:23.112
He probably went for a swim,

53:25.985 --> 53:30.119
oh he probably went to the
neighbor's camp, down the lake.

53:30.163 --> 53:33.688
Maybe they paddled by, and
he jumped on in with them.

53:33.732 --> 53:35.995
That sounds like something
crazy that Train would do.

53:36.038 --> 53:37.605
You know that's true.

53:37.649 --> 53:39.128
- Yeah, I mean especially if
there was a girl in the canoe.

53:39.172 --> 53:41.087
- Yeah.
- Or girls period.

53:41.130 --> 53:42.828
- [Mark] That's
right, yeah, yeah,

53:42.871 --> 53:44.917
that sound exactly
like what happened.

53:44.960 --> 53:47.702
Train always knows exactly
where the girls are.

53:47.746 --> 53:49.226
[Miller chuckles]

53:49.269 --> 53:52.098
- Yeah, maybe we should go
check some other sites, though.

53:52.141 --> 53:53.578
Miller, hop in.

53:53.621 --> 53:55.797
- Can't believe he
went without me.

53:55.841 --> 53:57.277
- [Mark] He went
without all of us.

53:57.321 --> 53:59.061
- We're gonna kick his ass.

53:59.105 --> 54:00.019
- Friggin' Train.

54:01.238 --> 54:03.196
Probably brought the
rye along with him, too.

54:03.240 --> 54:06.591
Showin' up like hey, I'm Train!

54:06.634 --> 54:08.201
It's time to party!

54:09.376 --> 54:10.682
- Can't believe he
went without me.

54:10.725 --> 54:13.032
We always do this kind
of stuff together.

54:13.075 --> 54:15.382
He's worst the wingman ever.

54:15.426 --> 54:18.646
[gentle guitar music]

54:25.000 --> 54:25.784
Train!

54:31.659 --> 54:32.443
- Train!

54:35.837 --> 54:37.274
- [Benny] Train!

54:52.114 --> 54:53.420
- [Mark] Train!

54:54.813 --> 54:55.683
- Anything?

54:58.817 --> 54:59.600
- Train!

55:06.172 --> 55:07.478
We'll get some answers.

55:07.521 --> 55:09.088
I'm sure they've seen him.
- I hope so.

55:09.131 --> 55:11.917
Last couple islands had nothing
but trees and rocks on them.

55:11.960 --> 55:13.222
- [Mark] Anybody here?

55:13.266 --> 55:14.485
We're looking for our
buddy, you seen him?

55:14.528 --> 55:15.312
Hello.

55:15.355 --> 55:16.835
- There's nobody here.

55:16.878 --> 55:18.402
- I'll check inside the
tent, maybe they're sleeping.

55:18.445 --> 55:19.272
Hello?

55:28.237 --> 55:30.936
Well, whoever they are,
they're not here anymore.

55:30.979 --> 55:32.067
It's weird, it's like
they just walked away

55:32.111 --> 55:33.417
and left all their stuff.

55:35.114 --> 55:36.594
- Okay, something's wrong.

55:38.247 --> 55:39.336
We've been here
twice in two days

55:39.379 --> 55:41.512
and twice, no one's around?

55:41.555 --> 55:43.252
I mean ,look at all this stuff.

55:43.296 --> 55:44.558
The coolers, the chairs,

55:44.602 --> 55:46.212
they're all in the same spot.

55:47.213 --> 55:48.867
It's like we were
the last ones here.

55:50.651 --> 55:51.652
- Yeah, it's creepy.

55:52.566 --> 55:54.394
- Oh, that's piss warm.

55:54.438 --> 55:56.527
- Seriously, you're
drinking right now?

55:56.570 --> 55:58.006
- I'm thirsty.

55:58.050 --> 55:59.356
- Oh, and you think
now is a good time?

55:59.399 --> 56:00.705
- It's hot inside.

56:00.748 --> 56:02.010
- Our friend is missing.

56:02.054 --> 56:04.056
We have no idea where
he is, or if he's okay,

56:04.099 --> 56:06.754
and you think it's a great
idea to get torn down.

56:06.798 --> 56:07.712
Just brilliant, Mill.

56:07.755 --> 56:09.322
- Who's getting torn down?

56:09.366 --> 56:11.280
I wanted a drink and it was
the first thing I found.

56:11.324 --> 56:12.194
Relax, Benny.

56:12.238 --> 56:13.631
- Don't tell me to relax!

56:13.674 --> 56:16.024
- Okay okay, let's just
take it down a thou.

56:16.068 --> 56:17.374
Let's just try and
think logically here.

56:17.417 --> 56:18.723
- Look, we need
to go back to town

56:18.766 --> 56:19.680
and get search and rescue.

56:19.724 --> 56:21.029
- We are not abandoning Train.

56:21.073 --> 56:22.553
We can't just leave
our friend here.

56:22.596 --> 56:24.163
- Oh yeah, what's
your idea Mill?

56:28.515 --> 56:30.387
- Okay, we've checked
literally all of the islands,

56:30.430 --> 56:32.301
like he's gotta be
on shore somewhere.

56:33.390 --> 56:34.521
- Yeah, where?

56:35.740 --> 56:36.958
What the hell do you
wanna do, Miller?

56:37.002 --> 56:38.351
Search the perimeter
of the whole damn lake?

56:38.395 --> 56:39.918
- I dunno, Benny, if
it means finding Train,

56:39.961 --> 56:41.354
that's obviously
what we have to do.

56:41.398 --> 56:43.443
- [Mark] Right, we should
go see if he's at the place

56:43.487 --> 56:44.662
where we got the firewood.

56:44.705 --> 56:46.446
- I know, maybe he's
at that campsite

56:46.490 --> 56:47.969
that we found yesterday.

56:48.013 --> 56:49.275
- Why the hell
would he go there?

56:49.318 --> 56:50.711
- Maybe he forgot
something there.

56:50.755 --> 56:51.930
Why do you have to argue

56:51.973 --> 56:53.061
with every single
suggestion that I make?

56:53.105 --> 56:54.367
- Look, I'm just...

56:55.977 --> 56:57.370
I have a bad feeling, okay?

56:57.414 --> 56:59.416
- [Mark] Okay, look, we're
letting our imaginations

56:59.459 --> 57:01.156
get out of control.

57:01.200 --> 57:03.289
There's obviously a
logical explanation.

57:03.332 --> 57:04.682
- We're wasting time.

57:04.725 --> 57:07.380
We need to get back to town
and get some real help.

57:07.424 --> 57:09.687
Search and rescue,
divers, I don't know.

57:09.730 --> 57:11.297
- Divers?

57:11.340 --> 57:12.864
What do you think he's at the
bottom of the lake, Benny?

57:12.907 --> 57:14.169
Why would you even say that?

57:14.213 --> 57:16.433
- All right, let's
just stay positive.

57:22.917 --> 57:25.616
[birds chirping]

57:40.544 --> 57:44.330
Okay, we'll cover more
ground if we split up.

57:44.373 --> 57:47.115
I'll go check out that
high ridge over there,

57:47.159 --> 57:48.334
get a better viewpoint.

57:48.377 --> 57:50.118
Mill, you and Benny
go to the place

57:50.162 --> 57:51.424
where we got the firewood,

57:51.468 --> 57:53.034
and we'll meet up
at the old campsite.

57:53.078 --> 57:54.383
- Yeah, okay, sounds good.

57:54.427 --> 57:55.167
Come on, Benny.

57:57.778 --> 57:59.301
- I have to go back to town.

58:00.477 --> 58:01.347
- [Both] What?

58:01.390 --> 58:03.262
- You guys stay and search.

58:03.305 --> 58:04.437
- What the hell, man?

58:04.481 --> 58:05.177
You're just gonna leave us here?

58:06.352 --> 58:09.007
- Maybe I'm overreacting,
maybe I'm not.

58:09.050 --> 58:10.399
Either way, take this.

58:11.879 --> 58:12.750
Now your phone's in the van.

58:12.793 --> 58:14.403
Call me if you find him.

58:15.883 --> 58:18.277
And if you don't, well
we need more help anyway.

58:18.320 --> 58:19.757
You guys can hike
back along the shore,

58:19.800 --> 58:21.410
and we'll meet at the boat
launch in a couple hours.

58:21.454 --> 58:23.456
- No, this is not what I meant

58:23.500 --> 58:25.676
when I said that we
should split up, Benny.

58:28.635 --> 58:30.550
- We're out of options.

59:01.929 --> 59:04.802
[insects chirping]

1:00:09.344 --> 1:00:12.565
[somber fiddle music]

1:01:12.973 --> 1:01:15.149
[Mark groans]

1:01:15.193 --> 1:01:15.976
- Train!

1:01:16.760 --> 1:01:19.501
[birds chirping]

1:01:35.126 --> 1:01:35.909
Train!

1:02:44.848 --> 1:02:46.458
Miller, come here!

1:02:49.243 --> 1:02:50.027
Miller!

1:02:52.594 --> 1:02:53.770
- [Miller] Yeah?

1:02:55.249 --> 1:02:56.033
- No luck?

1:02:57.034 --> 1:02:58.209
- No.

1:02:58.252 --> 1:02:59.776
- Here, let's
check the old camp.

1:03:08.872 --> 1:03:09.611
Benny?

1:03:11.613 --> 1:03:13.224
I thought you went
to go get help.

1:03:14.791 --> 1:03:15.574
- I did.

1:03:17.750 --> 1:03:20.753
Gave Train my keys
at the boat launch,

1:03:21.710 --> 1:03:23.060
he never gave 'em back.

1:03:24.670 --> 1:03:26.063
- Train!

1:03:26.106 --> 1:03:27.455
- He's not here.

1:03:27.499 --> 1:03:28.805
- Train!

1:03:28.848 --> 1:03:31.677
- He's not here, nobody's
here, it's useless.

1:03:31.720 --> 1:03:34.549
- Okay, we're gonna
get out of here.

1:03:34.593 --> 1:03:35.768
Everything's gonna be okay.

1:03:35.812 --> 1:03:37.683
- We can't even get
ourselves out of here.

1:03:37.726 --> 1:03:39.554
Damn it, Train!

1:03:39.598 --> 1:03:41.730
- This is literally the
last place we had to look.

1:03:41.774 --> 1:03:42.993
- We're gonna find Train.

1:03:43.036 --> 1:03:45.517
We're just gonna get
out of here together.

1:03:45.560 --> 1:03:47.606
We'll go, we'll take
Miller's car, right Mill?

1:03:47.649 --> 1:03:49.521
- Did you even look, Benny?

1:03:49.564 --> 1:03:50.783
- You shut the hell up, Miller.

1:03:50.827 --> 1:03:52.567
- Okay, Ben, don't
take it out on Miller.

1:03:52.611 --> 1:03:54.134
He's just, he's
a bit upset, too.

1:03:54.178 --> 1:03:55.744
- No, I'm tired of this crap.

1:03:55.788 --> 1:03:58.138
Every time we hang out,
it's like I'm babysitting

1:03:58.182 --> 1:03:59.879
a bunch of punk ass teenagers.

1:03:59.923 --> 1:04:01.489
- What the hell are
you talking about?

1:04:01.533 --> 1:04:04.188
- You guys act like such
immature little jackasses.

1:04:04.231 --> 1:04:06.103
You can't take
anything seriously.

1:04:06.146 --> 1:04:09.149
Train can't even be
trusted with a set of keys,

1:04:09.193 --> 1:04:10.324
and now we're stuck here.

1:04:10.368 --> 1:04:11.325
- You know what, Benny?

1:04:11.369 --> 1:04:12.849
Nobody asked you to babysit us

1:04:12.892 --> 1:04:14.285
- I wouldn't have to
if you guys didn't act

1:04:14.328 --> 1:04:15.068
like a bunch of idiots!

1:04:15.112 --> 1:04:15.895
- Guys!

1:04:15.939 --> 1:04:17.418
- [Both] Shut up, Mark!

1:04:17.462 --> 1:04:18.767
- Okay yeah, that's great,
thank you, terrific.

1:04:18.811 --> 1:04:19.899
- You think you're
so smart, Benny?

1:04:19.943 --> 1:04:22.206
You don't actually know shit.

1:04:22.249 --> 1:04:23.816
- All right, that's enough!

1:04:23.860 --> 1:04:24.686
All right?

1:04:29.169 --> 1:04:30.257
- Screw you, Benny!

1:04:32.607 --> 1:04:36.176
- Look, this is not
helping us find Train.

1:04:36.220 --> 1:04:37.743
Us turning on each other?

1:04:37.786 --> 1:04:38.962
Come on, guys.

1:04:44.837 --> 1:04:47.492
- Where are you, Train,
you little bastard?

1:04:47.535 --> 1:04:48.885
Bet ya he's hundreds
of yards from here,

1:04:48.928 --> 1:04:50.277
just having a laugh.

1:04:51.235 --> 1:04:52.105
I'll kick his head in.

1:04:52.149 --> 1:04:54.151
- That is not what's happening.

1:04:55.282 --> 1:04:56.936
- Oh, I'm Train!

1:04:56.980 --> 1:05:00.244
I'm gonna just scare everybody
'cause I'm a jackass.

1:05:00.287 --> 1:05:02.637
- That's not funny,
Benny, that's not funny.

1:05:02.681 --> 1:05:04.901
- I get ya all
stirred up, Benny?

1:05:06.163 --> 1:05:08.208
Hey Mark, how's
the girl problems?

1:05:08.252 --> 1:05:09.818
I'm just gonna open
that can of worms

1:05:09.862 --> 1:05:11.995
and let Benny deal with it.

1:05:12.038 --> 1:05:13.692
Hey Miller, you
want a beer, bud?

1:05:16.390 --> 1:05:17.174
Miller?

1:05:19.263 --> 1:05:21.613
Miller!
- Miller?

1:05:21.656 --> 1:05:23.006
- Miller!

1:05:23.049 --> 1:05:25.965
- No no no no no no!

1:05:26.009 --> 1:05:27.575
- [Benny] Miller!

1:05:36.715 --> 1:05:38.673
- What if we can't
find your keys?

1:05:38.717 --> 1:05:41.328
- There's no way he
had both sets of keys.

1:05:41.372 --> 1:05:42.677
I don't care if we
have to walk 12 miles,

1:05:42.721 --> 1:05:44.766
or hotwire a car, we're
getting off this island.

1:05:46.507 --> 1:05:48.074
- [Mark] Okay, I'll
check the pack.

1:05:48.118 --> 1:05:49.032
- [Benny] I'll check the tent.

1:05:55.995 --> 1:05:59.390
- Ah, I don't understand
why this is happening!

1:05:59.433 --> 1:06:00.782
- Keep your head.

1:06:00.826 --> 1:06:02.871
You're the only one who
hasn't lost his mind today.

1:06:02.915 --> 1:06:05.396
Even I was acting like an idiot.

1:06:06.571 --> 1:06:07.789
Should've been more
like you today.

1:06:07.833 --> 1:06:08.877
- Like me?

1:06:10.792 --> 1:06:12.098
Who would ever say that?

1:06:14.187 --> 1:06:15.493
No, when the chips are down,

1:06:15.536 --> 1:06:17.538
everyone wants to
be like you, Benny.

1:06:19.758 --> 1:06:21.194
No one comes to me for advice.

1:06:21.238 --> 1:06:24.676
Everyone knows I can't
even take care of myself,

1:06:24.719 --> 1:06:26.765
let alone anyone
else in a crisis.

1:06:26.808 --> 1:06:28.897
Everyone knows Benny's the man.

1:06:30.551 --> 1:06:32.031
Like in school, when
we used to get beat up,

1:06:32.075 --> 1:06:34.599
who was the one who
always stopped the fight?

1:06:34.642 --> 1:06:35.992
Benny.

1:06:36.035 --> 1:06:37.819
Or at the end of high school,

1:06:37.863 --> 1:06:40.257
when we couldn't figure
out if we wanted to go back

1:06:40.300 --> 1:06:42.955
for another year, or
go off to college?

1:06:42.999 --> 1:06:44.522
Who's the one who's
already engaged

1:06:44.565 --> 1:06:46.089
and got his life
all figured out?

1:06:46.132 --> 1:06:47.003
It's Benny.

1:06:49.266 --> 1:06:50.789
You always know
exactly what to do,

1:06:50.832 --> 1:06:53.748
and exactly how to do it.

1:06:55.663 --> 1:06:58.057
I mean, I know Mill
and Train and I,

1:06:58.101 --> 1:07:01.278
we always rip on ya about stuff,

1:07:01.321 --> 1:07:06.326
but the truth is, we wish
we had half of what you have

1:07:07.719 --> 1:07:11.897
regarding how to be
a man, or whatever.

1:07:14.900 --> 1:07:18.077
We're just meandering
through life aimlessly,

1:07:18.121 --> 1:07:21.385
and you've got it all
perfectly figured out.

1:07:23.778 --> 1:07:25.258
Everyone wants to be like Benny.

1:07:26.955 --> 1:07:28.131
No one wants to be like me.

1:07:30.002 --> 1:07:31.612
I don't even wanna be like me.

1:07:34.920 --> 1:07:36.530
Everyone wants to be like you.

1:07:44.408 --> 1:07:45.626
No keys over here.

1:07:45.670 --> 1:07:47.063
You having any luck
back there, bud?

1:07:51.154 --> 1:07:51.980
Benny?

1:07:55.941 --> 1:07:56.724
Benny?

1:08:01.120 --> 1:08:01.903
Benny?

1:08:06.560 --> 1:08:07.344
Benny!

1:08:10.347 --> 1:08:11.130
Benny!

1:08:15.917 --> 1:08:16.701
Benny!

1:08:19.399 --> 1:08:20.183
Benny!

1:08:21.706 --> 1:08:24.361
[birds chirping]

1:08:43.206 --> 1:08:46.122
12 miles, in the
dark if I have to.

1:08:48.602 --> 1:08:50.561
I'll be back with
help boys, I promise.
