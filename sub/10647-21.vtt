(LAUGHING)

00:05.890 --> 00:08.791
Yeah! It was Loki doing
a body swap whammie-jammie!

00:08.826 --> 00:10.759
And the Avengers didn't know
it wasn't me!

00:10.795 --> 00:12.628
(LAUGHS) All your adventures...

00:12.663 --> 00:13.996
It sounds amazing.

00:14.031 --> 00:16.965
But being a superhero, I mean,

00:17.001 --> 00:20.803
as fun as it is, it comes
with some drawbacks, right?

00:20.838 --> 00:22.771
Sure. The biggest one,

00:22.807 --> 00:24.773
keeping secrets from loved ones.

00:24.809 --> 00:26.279
Mary Jane Watson.

00:26.280 --> 00:28.377
She's been one of my best
friends since we were little.

00:28.413 --> 00:30.279
And now she finally knows
I'm Spider-Man.

00:30.614 --> 00:33.615
You have no idea what a relief it
is to be able to talk to her like this.

00:35.686 --> 00:37.986
It must take so much out of your life.

00:38.022 --> 00:41.857
Don't you sometimes wish you
could just be a normal person?

00:41.892 --> 00:43.659
I don't really think about it that way.

00:43.728 --> 00:45.894
I've got these powers now,
and it's my responsibility

00:45.930 --> 00:47.596
to use them to help people.

00:47.631 --> 00:49.765
Pete, have you ever thought
how random it was

00:49.800 --> 00:51.967
that you got bitten
by that radioactive spider?

00:52.002 --> 00:54.212
I mean, I was right next
to you on that field trip.

00:54.472 --> 00:56.336
It could just as easily have been me.

00:57.074 --> 00:58.907
Now there's a crazy thought.

00:58.943 --> 01:02.811
Mary Jane Watson is
the Ultimate Spider-Woman!

01:03.781 --> 01:04.813

01:17.595 --> 01:18.961

01:18.996 --> 01:21.454
Peter, if you're here, who's that?

01:21.732 --> 01:24.515
Uh, Nova?
Is that you in there?

01:24.735 --> 01:26.648
Another one of
your so-called "pranks"?

(GRUNTS)

01:31.876 --> 01:33.948
It's not coming off!
It's like it's...

His actual face?

Where did you learn to kick that hard?

02:21.425 --> 02:24.994
Adrenaline, I guess. You all right?

02:25.029 --> 02:26.261
I don't know.

02:26.297 --> 02:28.964
It's weird, but it felt like
he stole some of my...

02:29.266 --> 02:30.399
"Me."

02:30.434 --> 02:32.401
Let's get you to Dr. Connors.

02:32.436 --> 02:35.037
No, I'm feeling better.

02:35.072 --> 02:37.139
Well, at least better enough
to finish this poser!

Who are you?

Who are you?

02:48.352 --> 02:51.086
Cut out the imitation game,
Spider-sham.

02:51.122 --> 02:52.454
I don't need you to feed my ego.

02:52.490 --> 02:54.256
Need.

02:54.291 --> 02:57.259
Okay. Yes. Let's establish
a line of dialogue here.

02:57.294 --> 02:59.094
What do you need?
I can try to help.

02:59.130 --> 03:02.364
Need to feed!

03:28.259 --> 03:31.725
- You okay?
- I'm fine. But ow!

03:32.096 --> 03:33.262
I know, right?

03:33.297 --> 03:35.330
I thought that thing just wanted me.

03:38.035 --> 03:41.036
Not getting away that easy.
MJ, get to safety.

03:42.440 --> 03:44.206
Hey! No hitchhikers.

03:44.241 --> 03:47.042
No way. You're not leaving
this reporter behind.

03:47.078 --> 03:48.970
This could be the story of the century.

03:49.447 --> 03:52.147
MJ, after everything that happened
when Carnage took over the city,

03:52.183 --> 03:54.383
and that evil symbiote
bonded to you, I...

03:54.418 --> 03:56.218
I just can't risk losing you.

03:56.253 --> 03:59.188
Come on, tiger. You couldn't
lose me if you tried.

03:59.223 --> 04:01.223
I'm serious. My friend
Ben, (WEBS WHOOSHING)

04:01.258 --> 04:03.959
the Scarlet Spider,
was destroyed saving the city.

04:03.994 --> 04:05.360
I can't go through that again.

04:05.396 --> 04:08.130
Pete, I'm sorry that happened.

04:08.165 --> 04:11.170
But that's not me.
I've gotta see this through.

04:13.104 --> 04:14.269
Hey! He's down that alley!

04:14.305 --> 04:16.238
- Whoa!
- SPIDER-MAN: It's a dead-end.

04:16.273 --> 04:18.553
Clearly, he didn't
absorb my intelligence.

04:21.440 --> 04:22.610
Where is he?

04:23.047 --> 04:24.947
Maybe he's smarter than you think.

04:28.119 --> 04:30.152
No way he could have escaped
without us seeing him.

04:30.187 --> 04:32.221
Could he be invisible?

04:32.256 --> 04:35.023
Even if he was cloaked, it
wouldn't fool my Spidey sense.

04:37.995 --> 04:41.330
You sure? You didn't sense it
about to attack you in the park.

04:41.365 --> 04:42.364
Hmm.

04:44.068 --> 04:45.151
Point taken.

04:45.336 --> 04:48.971
Maybe 'cause it's trying to be
a duplicate of me, I couldn't sense it.

04:49.006 --> 04:50.038
You're good, you know that?

04:50.441 --> 04:52.374
Of course I know that.

04:52.409 --> 04:55.310
I also know that's probably not
another brick in the wall.

04:55.346 --> 04:57.079
When did you get so quippy?

04:57.114 --> 04:58.481
Wait! Don't do anything!

05:07.424 --> 05:09.391
Okay, this just got serious.

05:09.426 --> 05:12.327
For your own safety, I cannot let
you follow me down into that.

No problem, since you're following me.

05:25.442 --> 05:29.111
And you say I'm quippy.
It's a coping mechanism.

You wouldn't understand, 'cause
apparently nothing ever scares you.

05:39.089 --> 05:41.156
Is this, like,
some super-villain lair?

05:44.995 --> 05:48.096
More like a lab. And it looks like
we missed a pretty good fight.

05:48.132 --> 05:50.098
Every single one of these was hit.

05:50.134 --> 05:52.201
Like someone was searching
for something.

05:58.175 --> 06:00.275

06:01.278 --> 06:03.378
That looks like DNA. Right?

06:03.414 --> 06:07.015
Well, the structure's the same but
the molecules are totally different.

06:07.051 --> 06:09.952
Some kind of synthetic design
that can mimic real DNA.

06:09.987 --> 06:11.630
Another one of Hydra's synthezoids?

06:11.782 --> 06:14.122
That explains why our friend was
such a great conversationalist.

06:18.329 --> 06:21.163
Here we go. "Project Kaine."

06:21.198 --> 06:24.399
It's an attempt to synthesize
Spider DNA on a large scale.

06:24.435 --> 06:27.135
An army of mass-produced
Spider villains?

06:27.171 --> 06:29.271
I'd hate to meet them in a dark lab.

06:29.306 --> 06:31.073
Spidey...

06:31.865 --> 06:34.376
Oh, this "no Spider sense"
thing is the worst!

SYNTHEZOID: Kaine.

06:36.280 --> 06:40.282
ALL SYNTHEZOIDS: Kaine. We are Kaine!

06:43.053 --> 06:46.955
Kaine is so hungry.

06:47.593 --> 06:48.621
Yo, Kaine.

06:48.622 --> 06:51.639
I have to tell you, your
buddies are a little creepy.

06:52.029 --> 06:55.397
Kaine is like Spider.

"too-much-of-a-good-thing"
thing, until now.

07:11.550 --> 07:15.846
Uh, I thought "I'm my own worst
enemy" was just a figure of speech.

than just a lucky kick.

07:49.720 --> 07:50.722
Tell me about it.

07:52.541 --> 07:53.546
Huh?

Whoa! MJ?

you when it was attacking New York?

in that, when I can embrace it?

Face it, tiger. You just met
the Ultimate Spider-Woman.

to tell me about this?

- Okay, good point. But not the point.

right moment to tell you.

08:59.089 --> 09:01.623
After I was freed
from the Carnage Queen,

09:01.658 --> 09:04.272
I discovered some of the
symbiote was still bonded to me.

09:05.696 --> 09:07.896
That thing's dangerous.
You should have gotten help.

09:07.931 --> 09:10.732
I did. I went straight
to Dr. Connors.

09:10.768 --> 09:13.806
He's been working with me,
monitoring my progress daily.

09:19.977 --> 09:23.391
It took Agent Venom a lot of
training to control his symbiote.

09:23.418 --> 09:28.308
Agent Venom? Face it. I'm
stronger, faster, and sharper.

told you, what would you have done?

09:42.766 --> 09:45.555
Brought you into the Web Warriors.
You're one of us now.

09:49.006 --> 09:52.007
Exactly. You would have
made me join your team.

09:52.042 --> 09:54.910
But I'm not even sure
I want to be a superhero.

09:54.945 --> 09:57.514
Huh? What's better
than being a superhero?

09:58.949 --> 10:01.750
College, travel, journalism...

10:01.785 --> 10:03.919
I have plans for my life,
and they don't involve

10:03.954 --> 10:07.022
getting punched

10:08.058 --> 10:09.858

10:13.764 --> 10:15.831
Being a hero isn't always a choice.

power comes great responsibility."

10:21.105 --> 10:23.972
SPIDER-WOMAN: I have a lot
of responsibilities, Spidey.

10:24.007 --> 10:25.974
I'm responsible for myself.

10:26.009 --> 10:26.641
(GRUNTS)

10:26.641 --> 10:28.045
For my family.

10:28.145 --> 10:31.813
You don't seem to understand that running
around with a troop of superheroes

10:31.849 --> 10:34.966
isn't the only great
responsibility in the world.

10:42.793 --> 10:43.792

10:45.996 --> 10:48.096
If we're already in the secret lab,

10:48.132 --> 10:51.362
I guess that's the double-extra
super-duper secret lab.

10:51.527 --> 10:53.453
Whoa. What are those?

10:56.773 --> 10:57.973
Oh, come on!

11:01.979 --> 11:04.646
Only one person
builds mechanical tentacles...

11:04.681 --> 11:06.407
Dr. Octopus.

11:06.783 --> 11:09.985
Unless Aunt May's been secretly fighting
crime as the Amazing Squid-Lady.

11:10.020 --> 11:12.400
And after today, anything's possible.

11:15.959 --> 11:17.025
(GROANS)

11:17.060 --> 11:19.195
Those things really pack a kick.

11:19.930 --> 11:21.663
Spidey, you're hurt.

11:21.698 --> 11:23.732
We've got to get you
back to the Triskelion.

11:24.260 --> 11:25.225
I'm fine.

11:25.459 --> 11:27.414
Keeping secrets and overprotective?

11:27.738 --> 11:29.605
Now I know what it's like
to have me for a friend.

11:34.392 --> 11:37.879
Need to feed!

11:37.915 --> 11:40.578
Oh, this guy again.
Don't you ever quit?

(BOTH SCREAMING)

12:50.988 --> 12:53.349
Kaine feed!

12:54.157 --> 12:55.790
SPIDER-WOMAN: What do we do?

12:55.826 --> 12:58.793
- I can't move!
- Feed.

12:58.829 --> 13:00.028
(GRUNTS)

13:08.739 --> 13:10.672
Get into some trouble, punks?

13:13.043 --> 13:16.280
Scarlet Spider? Alive?

13:20.634 --> 13:22.767
You're alive!

13:22.803 --> 13:24.397
Don't remind me.

13:27.608 --> 13:29.774
Wait. That's the guy
you told me about?

13:29.810 --> 13:33.578
He's a lot less... I don't know...
Dead, than you described.

13:33.614 --> 13:35.988
Scarlet was a trusted member
of the Web Warriors.

13:36.516 --> 13:37.549
He was my friend.

13:37.851 --> 13:40.452
(GRUNTS)

13:40.487 --> 13:42.593
But he was really a spy for Doc Ock.

13:42.723 --> 13:44.570
He betrayed me and the team.

13:44.791 --> 13:46.658
Even told Ock my real name.

13:46.693 --> 13:49.728
Ock used me, like I was another
one of his blasted Octobots.

13:49.763 --> 13:51.591
I can't let him get away with that.

13:51.598 --> 13:54.599
If Scarlet did all that, why aren't
we taking him down right now?

13:54.835 --> 13:56.901
Because in the end,
he did the right thing.

13:56.937 --> 14:00.584
He stopped Ock, and crashed the flying
Hydra Island base into the bay.

14:01.775 --> 14:03.030
You saved New York.

14:03.249 --> 14:05.028
We searched for you for days.

14:05.045 --> 14:06.644
I didn't want to be found.

14:07.814 --> 14:08.847
(GRUNTS)

14:11.485 --> 14:13.451
Watch it with the flying
debris there, buddy.

14:13.487 --> 14:15.187
I don't know who
you think you... Hey!

14:15.222 --> 14:18.290
Neither do I. Ock wiped all my
memories when he gave me powers.

14:18.625 --> 14:22.071
He told me I was the first
Spider, an early experiment.

14:22.663 --> 14:24.067
"Early experiment"?

14:24.598 --> 14:27.382
Maybe you won him first place in the
little super-villain science fair.

14:27.668 --> 14:30.735
This is no joke, punk.
Ock messed with my head.

14:30.771 --> 14:32.637
Used me to hurt those I cared about.

14:32.673 --> 14:34.201
I can't let that stand.

14:34.274 --> 14:37.029
"Those you cared about." That's the
nicest thing I've ever heard you say.

14:37.030 --> 14:38.543
I'm getting the warm fuzzies here.

14:40.614 --> 14:42.034
Okay. If we want data,

14:42.035 --> 14:45.329
maybe we should try using computers
instead of bashing them.

14:46.753 --> 14:49.729
Why come here, Scarlet?
What are you looking for?

14:49.756 --> 14:52.724
Revenge. He wants to find Doc Ock.

14:52.759 --> 14:56.184
And end him, once and for all.

14:56.530 --> 14:59.400
But Ock moved his lab. I found
a couple of Hydra lackeys,

14:59.400 --> 15:02.320
and convinced them to tell me where.

15:02.436 --> 15:05.603
- That led you here.
- But I was attacked by that synthezoid.

15:05.639 --> 15:07.872
An old experiment to mimic your powers.

15:07.908 --> 15:10.508
Must have been left here
as a security system.

15:10.544 --> 15:11.822
Yeah, we met him.

15:12.246 --> 15:14.710
But why didn't you tell us
you were alive?

15:14.715 --> 15:18.201
I almost destroyed
S.H.I.E.L.D. and Aunt May.

15:18.652 --> 15:19.992
Not proud of that.

15:20.354 --> 15:23.314
What would you all have done
if I came back? Lock me up?

15:23.457 --> 15:25.463
No. We would have
brought you back home.

15:25.659 --> 15:27.726
I can't believe you wouldn't
tell me you were alive.

15:27.761 --> 15:29.959
Everyone seems to be keeping secrets.

15:29.959 --> 15:32.564
Good thing you have
a reporter around, Spidey.

15:32.599 --> 15:35.500
And what do you want to do,
show Ock your press pass?

15:35.535 --> 15:37.435
My job is hunting through facts,

15:37.471 --> 15:39.904
accessing files,
information, locations...

15:39.940 --> 15:41.479
Like this.

15:41.875 --> 15:43.842
(WHIRRING)

15:47.547 --> 15:49.972
Did someone say "press pass"?

15:55.522 --> 15:57.822
Ock's been here, all right.
Recently.

15:57.858 --> 15:58.987
(SIGHS)

15:59.171 --> 16:00.533
He's close.

16:00.627 --> 16:03.461
Finally, revenge on
that eight-limbed freak.

16:03.497 --> 16:05.764
(SCOFFS) There are more
important things than revenge.

16:05.799 --> 16:07.799
Nothing else is coming to mind.

16:07.834 --> 16:09.501
SPIDER-MAN: How about the truth?

16:09.536 --> 16:11.384
Why did Ock give you those powers?

16:11.538 --> 16:14.801
Who were you before? A hundred
questions that need answers.

16:14.875 --> 16:17.809
Here's one. Who cares?

16:17.844 --> 16:21.536
You should. Getting your life back
is worth more than vengeance.

16:21.615 --> 16:24.300
What if you have a family,
people who miss you?

16:27.721 --> 16:31.344
Last time I had a family,
I almost destroyed them.

16:31.725 --> 16:33.699
Won't be making that mistake again.

16:39.900 --> 16:43.122
DOC OCK: Must be here. It must be.

16:43.570 --> 16:44.120
Unless...

16:44.145 --> 16:44.846
(GASPS)

16:45.672 --> 16:48.443
He didn't. He wouldn't!

16:49.643 --> 16:50.809
Huh?

16:51.107 --> 16:53.183
Ah, you're early.

16:53.329 --> 16:55.613
I thought those prototype
synthezoids I released

16:55.649 --> 16:57.682
would have kept you busy a bit longer.

16:57.717 --> 17:00.326
They're done, Ock, and so are you!

17:00.327 --> 17:01.517
Scarlet, wait!

17:01.855 --> 17:03.588
(LAUGHING)

17:03.623 --> 17:07.964
Yes, Scarlet, wait until I do this!

17:11.598 --> 17:12.587
What now?

17:12.699 --> 17:15.771
- More lame Spider-Man copies?
- Hey now!

17:15.801 --> 17:20.202
I think you'll have more fun
with these, Scarlet Spider.

17:24.544 --> 17:27.637
I had plenty of your DNA on hand.

17:30.684 --> 17:32.233
Get back, punks.

17:32.586 --> 17:34.258
SYNTHEZOIDS: Get back, punks.

17:34.754 --> 17:37.633
Well, if they don't slice us, they
can always annoy us into submission.

17:38.925 --> 17:41.626
(GRUNTING)

17:51.638 --> 17:54.672
Have I mentioned you two would be
great on the Web Warriors team?

17:54.708 --> 17:56.160
BOTH: Give it a rest.

17:56.810 --> 17:59.410
(BEEPING)

17:59.446 --> 18:02.545
All my data.
All of it, taken!

18:02.837 --> 18:04.690
Blast you, Zola!

18:04.751 --> 18:06.517
(GRUNTS)

18:06.553 --> 18:07.585
(GROANS)

18:09.055 --> 18:11.022
It's over, Ock.
Unless you're planning

18:11.057 --> 18:12.857
to unleash a bunch
of synth-Novas.

18:12.892 --> 18:14.725
- 'Cause that would be really be annoy...
- (GRUNTS)

18:16.796 --> 18:18.863
Finally, revenge.

18:18.898 --> 18:19.627
(GASPS)

18:19.627 --> 18:20.765
Wait!

18:20.800 --> 18:22.934
He's right, Scarlet.
You waited this long.

18:22.969 --> 18:25.308
Get the truth. Get the answers.

18:26.639 --> 18:27.905
(CHUCKLING)

18:31.077 --> 18:33.553
Talk, while you still can.

18:33.713 --> 18:36.547
You were supposed to be
Hydra's first attempt

18:36.583 --> 18:38.883
to create an arachnid-powered
soldier, Scarlet.

18:38.918 --> 18:40.718
But they kept failing.

18:40.754 --> 18:43.988
Arnim Zola had no choice
but to partner with me.

18:44.024 --> 18:45.681
So you helped him?

18:45.759 --> 18:49.315
"Helped"? I revitalized
Zola's crude approach

18:49.316 --> 18:51.896
with my elegant biological research.

18:51.931 --> 18:56.414
Zola may have started you,
but I perfected you.

18:56.569 --> 18:58.703
You are my masterpiece.

18:58.772 --> 19:00.872
Oh, he's a piece of work, all right.

19:00.907 --> 19:04.163
Get to the point, Ock,
before Scarlet does.

19:04.163 --> 19:05.864
The point is simple.

19:05.912 --> 19:08.546
You, Scarlet, have a past.

19:08.581 --> 19:10.815
A unique and fascinating past.

19:10.850 --> 19:14.919
And knowing it will change
everything about who you are.

19:14.954 --> 19:16.081
(GRUNTS)

19:16.081 --> 19:17.432
Then tell me!

19:17.557 --> 19:19.757
Tell me who I was!
Who I am!

19:19.793 --> 19:22.727
Alas, you wouldn't believe me if I did.

19:22.762 --> 19:26.664
But proof of your origin,
everything that you seek,

19:26.699 --> 19:28.833
is on Hydra Island.

19:28.868 --> 19:33.653
So it's gone. Hydra Island sunk
to the bottom of the sea. It's destroyed.

19:33.678 --> 19:34.972
(LAUGHING)

19:35.008 --> 19:39.573
The island yet lives,
as does Zola himself.

19:39.746 --> 19:43.548
It's he who holds the key
to your past, Scarlet.

19:43.583 --> 19:46.551
I came here to find my lost research,

19:46.586 --> 19:48.986
only to discover that,
like your own life,

19:49.022 --> 19:51.208
Arnim Zola stole it.

19:51.991 --> 19:54.559
He's down there, Scarlet,

19:54.594 --> 19:58.347
and so are the answers
to who you really are.

19:58.765 --> 20:00.169
You're lying.

20:00.400 --> 20:03.794
Am I? Or are you
about to destroy

20:03.795 --> 20:07.316
the only person who can
lead you to the truth?

20:07.740 --> 20:08.491
(GRUNTS)

20:08.716 --> 20:11.036
You're taking me there. Now!

20:11.478 --> 20:13.694
Scarlet, I can't let you do that!

20:15.682 --> 20:18.473
You're the one who said the truth
is more important than revenge.

20:18.685 --> 20:21.312
Taking a super-villain to a sunken
evil fortress of destruction

20:21.313 --> 20:22.653
is not what I meant.

20:25.058 --> 20:28.860
Tough luck, punk. This is
my journey, not yours.

20:31.831 --> 20:33.698
(GRUNTS) Scarlet, wait!

20:33.733 --> 20:35.566
(GRUNTS)

20:35.602 --> 20:36.934
(MECHANICAL HUMMING)

20:46.980 --> 20:49.529
I don't want to mess with your life's
plan, but I have to stop them.

20:49.649 --> 20:51.608
Ock always has an ulterior motive.

20:51.751 --> 20:54.785
If he gains access to his
research and Hydra's technology,

20:54.821 --> 20:56.515
there'll be nothing to stop him.

20:57.056 --> 21:01.571
Yeah, well, "With great power comes
great responsibility," right?

21:01.828 --> 21:04.453
Now go. I'll get the rest of our team.

21:04.731 --> 21:07.832
Ha! You said "our team."
That mean you're joining up?

21:07.867 --> 21:10.051
Ask me after we stop Ock.

21:10.703 --> 21:13.472
- Ow! Spikey.
- Sorry! Sorry!

21:17.677 --> 21:19.216
But you don't have a submarine.

21:19.712 --> 21:21.578
Don't worry.
I'll hitch a ride with them.

21:21.681 --> 21:22.647
(BEEPS)

21:24.851 --> 21:28.673
Whatever you have planned,
Ock, I'll be there.
