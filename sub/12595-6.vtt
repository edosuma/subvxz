<b>What exactly did you do here?</b>

10:11.378 --> 10:13.113

10:14.515 --> 10:17.184

10:28.028 --> 10:29.196
<b>is a pretty clear suggestion</b>

10:29.296 --> 10:31.665
<b>that it's supposed to be</b>
<b>a large piece of art.</b>

10:31.765 --> 10:32.833

10:38.639 --> 10:39.873

10:39.973 --> 10:42.709
<b>- Doing landscapes is</b>

10:42.809 --> 10:44.478
<b>You didn't use up</b>
<b>the entire truck,</b>

10:44.578 --> 10:47.014
<b>but compared to the people</b>
<b>that did use the entire truck,</b>

10:47.114 --> 10:49.883

<b>concentrated details.</b>

10:49.983 --> 10:51.552
<b>Getting the texture in the tree,</b>

<b>this big rock with the dark</b>

10:59.193 --> 11:01.528

11:01.628 --> 11:03.830
<b>It gives it a great focal point,</b>

11:03.931 --> 11:05.832
<b>and you did use the whole truck</b>
<b>in my opinion.</b>

11:05.933 --> 11:07.901
<b>That stuff doesn't come off</b>
<b>on its own.</b>

11:08.068 --> 11:09.469
<b>You worked from one side</b>

11:09.570 --> 11:11.672
<b>using 53 feet, the way I see it.</b>

11:11.772 --> 11:14.942

11:15.075 --> 11:16.643
<b>- All right, guys, today</b>
<b>we're testing composition.</b>

11:16.743 --> 11:19.947
<b>- For me, Sausage and Jime</b>
<b>dropped the ball.</b>

11:20.080 --> 11:22.115
<b>This is a clear-cut</b>
<b>composition challenge.</b>

11:22.216 --> 11:23.717
<b>It's about putting</b>
<b>elements together</b>

11:23.817 --> 11:24.985
<b>to make an appealing image,</b>

11:25.085 --> 11:27.988
<b>and their design is</b>
<b>maybe 8 to 10 feet at the most,</b>

11:28.088 --> 11:28.889
<b>and looking at it</b>
<b>from across the parking lot</b>

11:28.989 --> 11:30.924
<b>even now, I don't see a skull.</b>

11:31.091 --> 11:34.795
<b>- Megan Jean and Christian</b>
<b>had a rough outing as well.</b>

11:34.895 --> 11:36.096
<b>- I would not have</b>
<b>called it out being Medusa.</b>

11:36.196 --> 11:38.165
<b>- Never.</b>

11:38.265 --> 11:40.133
<b>- I just don't think it was</b>
<b>a well composed layout.</b>

11:41.468 --> 11:43.237

11:43.337 --> 11:45.839

<b>using a pressure washer</b>
<b>and a little ingenuity.</b>

11:50.844 --> 11:53.780
<b>- Cleen and Alex also utilized</b>
<b>the whole canvas.</b>

11:53.881 --> 11:56.016
<b>- Cleen's artistry</b>
<b>prior to this was graffiti.</b>

11:56.116 --> 11:59.753
<b>It really gave him a sense</b>
<b>of how to lay out a huge area.</b>

11:59.853 --> 12:02.389
<b>It's not the cleanest,</b>

12:02.489 --> 12:04.057
<b>but from a distance,</b>
<b>I think it's all right.</b>

12:04.124 --> 12:05.058

16:05.504 --> 16:07.506
<b>- What the [bleep] are all</b>
<b>these big words they're using?</b>

16:07.573 --> 16:09.442
<b>- 75% of the face has to show.</b>

16:09.475 --> 16:13.546
<b>- Sarah, why did you choose this</b>
<b>as your elimination tattoo?</b>

16:13.646 --> 16:16.015
<b>- The female face is one</b>
<b>of the most difficult portraits.</b>

16:16.115 --> 16:17.950
<b>You have to have perfect blend,</b>
<b>perfect saturation,</b>

16:18.050 --> 16:20.453
<b>and precision.</b> <b>- Damn.</b>

16:20.519 --> 16:22.288
<b>Of course she's gonna choose</b>
<b>something like this,</b>

16:22.455 --> 16:24.156
<b>'cause it's only her</b>
<b>that understands</b>

16:24.257 --> 16:25.291
<b>what she's talking about.</b>

16:25.458 --> 16:27.226
<b>- Have a seat.</b>

16:27.326 --> 16:28.261
<b>- Did you get all that, Megan?</b>

16:28.361 --> 16:29.028
<b>- Mm-hmm.</b>
<b>- You excited?</b>

16:29.128 --> 16:30.263
<b>- [laughs]</b>
<b>- No.</b>

16:30.363 --> 16:33.332
<b>- Today you must show</b>
<b>composition</b>

16:33.466 --> 16:36.202
<b>by tattooing</b>
<b>a surrealistic female.</b>

16:36.302 --> 16:38.704
<b>Because you're combining</b>
<b>a female face</b>

16:38.804 --> 16:43.209
<b>with other elements,</b>
<b>great composition is crucial.</b>

16:43.309 --> 16:44.477
<b>Let's meet your canvases.</b>

16:49.081 --> 16:52.485
<b>- Anthony and Matti,</b>
<b>you two won the flash challenge,</b>

16:52.518 --> 16:55.688
<b>so you now have the power</b>
<b>to assign the canvases.</b>

16:55.788 --> 16:58.858
<b>Your choices can alter</b>
<b>the entire competition,</b>

16:58.958 --> 17:00.927
<b>so don't take them lightly.</b>

17:01.027 --> 17:03.496
<b> <i>- Let me show you assholes</i> </b>
<b> <i>how to pick skulls.</i> </b>

17:03.563 --> 17:06.531
<b>Obviously, every new artist</b>
<b>that comes in here</b>

17:06.632 --> 17:07.867
<b>is gonna get</b>
<b>the worst skull pick.</b>

17:07.967 --> 17:09.569
<b> <i>Guess what, Sausage,</i> </b>
<b> <i>you get the second.</i> </b>

17:09.669 --> 17:10.736
<b>I'm gonna put that Sausage</b>
<b>in the microwave</b>

17:10.836 --> 17:12.070
<b>until he bursts.</b>

17:12.171 --> 17:13.539
<b>- Surrealistic woman's face</b>

17:13.638 --> 17:17.343
<b>blending into a post-apocalyptic</b>
<b>Philadelphia skyline.</b>

17:17.443 --> 17:20.246
<b>- I want</b>
<b>a surreal-looking mermaid</b>

17:20.346 --> 17:21.948
<b>that blends</b>
<b>into an ocean-themed background.</b>

17:22.048 --> 17:24.450
<b>- The mermaid's awful.</b>

17:24.517 --> 17:26.953
<b> <i>The texture of the skin</i> </b>
<b> <i>is very loose.</i> </b>

17:27.053 --> 17:30.523
<b>- Gothic Virgin Mary</b>
<b>with a celestial background</b>

17:30.623 --> 17:33.125
<b>and a crow coming out of her.</b>

17:33.225 --> 17:34.727
<b>- Oh.</b>

17:34.827 --> 17:37.463
<b>- Gorgeous woman with her hair</b>
<b>blending into constellations.</b>

17:37.530 --> 17:41.334
<b>- I want a beautiful woman's</b>
<b>face morphing into a wolf.</b>

17:41.467 --> 17:43.736
<b>- This chick wants a wolf</b>
<b>and a woman morphing.</b>

17:43.836 --> 17:45.156
<b> <i>What the hell does that</i> </b>
<b> <i>even mean?</i> </b>

17:47.373 --> 17:48.808
<b>- Okay.</b>

17:48.908 --> 17:49.942
<b> <i>Matti's definitely learning</i> </b>
<b> <i>how to play this game</i> </b>

17:50.042 --> 17:51.310
<b> <i>as a smart veteran.</i> </b>

17:51.477 --> 17:52.678
<b> <i>There's three people that</i> </b>
<b> <i>go to the finale.</i> </b>

17:52.778 --> 17:55.047
<b> <i>Matti can be one of 'em,</i> </b>
<b> <i>so why not help us</i> </b>

17:55.147 --> 17:56.187
<b> <i>take these other guys out?</i> </b>

17:56.249 --> 17:57.583
<b>You guys think I'm quiet,</b>

17:57.683 --> 17:59.552
<b>but I hope you're ready</b>
<b>for what's coming.</b>

18:01.621 --> 18:04.123
<b>- Canvases, one by one,</b>
<b>please read the artist's name</b>

18:04.223 --> 18:05.725
<b>on the bottom of your skull.</b>

18:05.825 --> 18:07.560
<b>- Megan.</b>

18:08.995 --> 18:09.995
<b>- Alex.</b>

18:11.063 --> 18:12.063
<b>- Jime.</b>

18:16.035 --> 18:18.871
<b> <i>[dramatic music]</i> </b>

18:18.971 --> 18:19.971
<b>- Sarah.</b>

18:20.039 --> 18:21.274
<b>- Aw, [bleep].</b>

18:21.440 --> 18:23.640
<b>Go ahead and bring it, give me</b>
<b>whatever canvas you want.</b>

18:23.709 --> 18:25.444
<b>I will take whatever lumps</b>
<b>come my way.</b>

18:25.478 --> 18:26.445
<b> <i>I'm here to win.</i> </b>

18:26.479 --> 18:27.013
<b>[laughter]</b>

18:27.113 --> 18:28.648
<b>- Christian.</b>

18:29.749 --> 18:30.749
<b>- Matti.</b>

18:31.183 --> 18:33.886
<b> <i>♪</i> </b>

18:33.986 --> 18:35.488
<b>- Sausage.</b>

18:35.588 --> 18:37.323
<b>- She wants a full body</b>
<b>underwater scene.</b>

18:37.456 --> 18:38.824
<b> <i>- Fudgsicles.</i> </b>

18:38.925 --> 18:40.459
<b>This is a really difficult piece</b>

18:40.526 --> 18:42.628
<b>and it's really difficult skin</b>
<b>to work on.</b>

18:42.728 --> 18:45.164
<b> <i>Matti wants to prove</i> </b>
<b> <i>that he is better than me.</i> </b>

18:45.264 --> 18:46.544
<b>I'm gonna prove to him</b>
<b>why he was</b>

18:46.599 --> 18:47.833
<b>taken out of the competition.</b>

18:47.934 --> 18:48.934
<b>- Anthony.</b>

18:50.937 --> 18:52.471
<b>- Cleen Rock One.</b>

18:52.538 --> 18:54.774
<b>- Should I just</b>
<b>pack my stuff now?</b>

18:54.874 --> 18:57.543
<b>- Okay, guys, remember,</b>
<b>after the elimination tattoo,</b>

18:57.643 --> 18:59.111
<b>the human canvas jury will</b>
<b>vote on the tattoo</b>

18:59.211 --> 19:02.248
<b>that they think is the worst</b>

19:02.348 --> 19:03.616
<b>and put one artist</b>
<b>up for elimination.</b>

19:03.716 --> 19:08.421
<b>You'll have six hours to tattoo</b>
<b>a surrealistic female.</b>

19:08.487 --> 19:11.991
<b>Based on your work,</b>
<b>one of you will close shop.</b>

19:12.091 --> 19:13.091
<b>Good luck.</b>

19:14.427 --> 19:16.062
<b>- Sarah has chosen</b>
<b>surrealistic faces.</b>

19:16.162 --> 19:18.764
<b>It'll be a face with an object</b>
<b>melding together.</b>

19:18.864 --> 19:19.966
<b>- Atom bomb going off</b>
<b>in the back,</b>

19:20.066 --> 19:22.134
<b>and, like, half of the city's</b>
<b>torn down already</b>

19:22.235 --> 19:23.703
<b>and the outside's</b>
<b>still pristine.</b>

19:23.803 --> 19:25.323
<b>- The woman's face</b>
<b>right in the middle,</b>

19:25.438 --> 19:26.973
<b>just kind of looking forward.</b>

19:27.073 --> 19:28.741
<b>- The composition is everything</b>
<b>in this tattoo,</b>

19:28.841 --> 19:31.244
<b>because taking two things</b>
<b>and constructing them together</b>

19:31.344 --> 19:32.745
<b> <i>is gonna create a lot of flow</i> </b>

19:32.845 --> 19:34.046
<b> <i>and a lot of movement</i> </b>
<b> <i>on the canvas's body</i> </b>

19:34.146 --> 19:35.881
<b>if you do it right.</b>

19:37.850 --> 19:39.318
<b>- I kind of liked your idea.</b>
<b>It's a... 'cause you...</b>

19:39.452 --> 19:41.454
<b>tell me a little bit more</b>
<b>about it.</b>

19:41.520 --> 19:44.357
<b>- The Virgin Mary,</b>
<b>but as a gothic figurine</b>

19:44.457 --> 19:46.459
<b>with a crow in the background</b>

19:46.559 --> 19:49.929
<b>and have, like, a sunburst</b>
<b>behind her.</b>

19:50.029 --> 19:52.131
<b> <i>- The Virgin Mary with a crow?</i> </b>

19:52.231 --> 19:55.067
<b> <i>This girl doesn't want</i> </b>
<b> <i>a surreal tattoo at all.</i> </b>

19:55.167 --> 19:56.769
<b>She wants a prayer candle.</b>

19:56.869 --> 19:59.572
<b> <i>I need to talk my canvas</i> </b>
<b> <i>out of this idea.</i> </b>

19:59.672 --> 20:00.706
<b>I want to play with this</b>
<b>a little bit.</b>

20:00.806 --> 20:03.709
<b>You're dreaming</b>
<b>about this beautiful woman,</b>

20:03.809 --> 20:04.744
<b>you know it's the Virgin Mary.</b>

20:04.844 --> 20:06.746
<b>All of a sudden,</b>
<b>she just starts melting</b>

20:06.846 --> 20:08.848
<b>and breaks apart into crows.</b>

20:08.948 --> 20:11.017
<b>Like, that's</b>
<b>a surrealistic element.</b>

20:11.117 --> 20:13.519
<b> <i>I'm going to turn this around</i> </b>
<b> <i>to my advantage.</i> </b>

20:13.619 --> 20:15.021
<b>This is my challenge.</b>

20:15.121 --> 20:17.723
<b>Like, I have to just</b>
<b>knock this out of the park.</b>

20:17.823 --> 20:18.824
<b>Come over here and stand up</b>
<b>real quick.</b>

20:18.925 --> 20:20.426
<b>- Yes.</b>

20:20.526 --> 20:22.246
<b>- So this part is female,</b>
<b>on my face, right?</b>

20:22.328 --> 20:23.629
<b>- Yeah.</b>

20:23.729 --> 20:25.865
<b>- And then this part will morph</b>
<b>into a wolf head.</b>

20:25.965 --> 20:28.668
<b> <i>- A wolf morphing</i> </b>
<b> <i>into a girl's face,</i> </b>

20:28.768 --> 20:31.103
<b>which to me, I think is</b>
<b>the stupidest idea ever.</b>

20:31.203 --> 20:34.240
<b> <i>The only thing close between</i> </b>
<b> <i>a wolf and a girl's face</i> </b>

20:34.340 --> 20:35.641
<b>is they both have eyes.</b>

20:35.741 --> 20:37.343
<b>- I still want it</b>
<b>to look feminine.</b>

20:37.443 --> 20:40.046
<b>- This, you know,</b>
<b>it's not my... not my forte.</b>

20:40.146 --> 20:41.647
<b> <i>This is super difficult</i> </b>
<b> <i>right now,</i> </b>

20:41.747 --> 20:43.182
<b>'cause I'm going up</b>
<b>against somebody</b>

20:43.282 --> 20:45.718
<b>that's internationally known</b>
<b>for doing surrealistic faces.</b>

20:45.818 --> 20:48.721
<b>I'm not good at doing</b>
<b>surrealistic [bleep].</b>

20:48.821 --> 20:50.122
<b>I don't even know</b>
<b>where to start.</b>

20:54.312 --> 20:56.915
<b> <i>[rock music]</i> </b>

20:58.149 --> 21:00.619
<b>- Hey, thanks, guys,</b>
<b>for throwing me under the bus.</b>

21:00.719 --> 21:02.020
<b>- Oh, you don't like it?</b>

21:02.120 --> 21:03.355
<b>- I don't even know</b>
<b>what this challenge is about.</b>

21:03.455 --> 21:07.659
<b>My canvas wants a wolf and a...</b>
<b>oh, what does she want?</b>

21:07.759 --> 21:09.594
<b>- She wants the face</b>
<b>turning into a wolf.</b>

21:09.694 --> 21:10.829
<b>- Yeah.</b>
<b>- Yeah.</b>

21:10.929 --> 21:12.664
<b>- So what do I... just do</b>
<b>a face turning into a wolf?</b>

21:12.764 --> 21:14.132
<b>- Like a morph.</b>

21:14.232 --> 21:15.300
<b>- What the hell</b>
<b>does that even mean?</b>

21:15.400 --> 21:17.168
<b>Like, how do you morph</b>
<b>a wolf into a woman?</b>

21:17.269 --> 21:19.404
<b>- You can't morph.</b>

21:19.504 --> 21:20.672
<b>- Why don't you get her to do</b>
<b>a face with a wolf on top?</b>

21:20.772 --> 21:23.074
<b>- Sarah clearly said</b>
<b>the face of the woman...</b>

21:23.174 --> 21:24.614
<b>- 75%.</b>
<b>- Right, so you can't morph...</b>

21:24.676 --> 21:29.548
<b>- 75% divided by six minus four</b>
<b>with a three-drop water system?</b>

21:29.648 --> 21:30.982
<b>Like, dude, I'm freaking out.</b>

21:31.082 --> 21:32.250
<b>I don't know how</b>
<b>I'm gonna morph...</b>

21:32.350 --> 21:34.486
<b>I don't even know</b>
<b>where to start with this?</b>

21:34.586 --> 21:36.054
<b>How are you morphing this?</b>

21:36.154 --> 21:37.856
<b>- Was that one of the rules,</b>
<b>morphing?</b>

21:37.956 --> 21:39.791
<b>- Maybe it's got a face</b>
<b>of a woman and an ass of a wolf,</b>

21:39.891 --> 21:40.891
<b>I don't know.</b>

21:40.926 --> 21:42.527
<b>So back to this morphing thing.</b>

21:42.627 --> 21:43.495
<b>Are there, like, certain rules?</b>

21:43.595 --> 21:46.131
<b>'Cause I have to do a wolf...</b>

21:46.231 --> 21:47.265
<b>- Uh-huh.</b>
<b>- I have to do a face.</b>

21:47.365 --> 21:50.001
<b>- It's more than just a wolf</b>
<b>and a face.</b>

21:50.101 --> 21:55.307
<b>What surrealism is is more</b>
<b>dreams becoming reality.</b>

21:55.407 --> 21:56.074
<b>- Okay.</b>
<b>- All right?</b>

21:56.141 --> 21:58.076
<b>It's your subconscious</b>

21:58.109 --> 22:00.378
<b>that's taking a problem</b>
<b>that your conscious mind has,</b>

22:00.478 --> 22:02.747
<b>which then will have input</b>

22:02.848 --> 22:03.715
<b>from whatever that</b>
<b>you've watched, so...</b>

22:03.815 --> 22:04.683
<b>- You're using</b>
<b>too many big words.</b>

22:04.783 --> 22:07.485
<b>I can't even talk to you</b>
<b>right now.</b>

22:07.586 --> 22:08.706
<b>I don't know what I'm doing.</b>

22:10.088 --> 22:12.891
<b>- All right, guys,</b>
<b>Sarah Miller challenged you</b>

22:12.991 --> 22:14.693
<b>to tattoo a surrealistic female.</b>

22:14.793 --> 22:18.463
<b>You will have six hours</b>
<b>to tattoo.</b>

22:18.563 --> 22:21.967
<b>Your time starts... now.</b>

22:22.100 --> 22:23.201
<b>- All right.</b>
<b>- Let's do it.</b>

22:23.301 --> 22:24.636
<b>- Come over here.</b>
<b>Let's do the stencil.</b>

22:24.736 --> 22:25.737
<b>- Nice.</b>

22:25.837 --> 22:27.105
<b>- With surrealism,</b>
<b>you're pretty much</b>

22:27.205 --> 22:28.640
<b>opening the door to anything</b>
<b>from the imagination.</b>

22:28.740 --> 22:29.975
<b>- Go big or go home.</b>

22:30.108 --> 22:32.511
<b>- With this strong group</b>
<b>of artists,</b>

22:32.611 --> 22:34.479
<b> <i>I expect to see great tattoos.</i> </b>

22:38.283 --> 22:39.584
<b>- I already messed up</b>
<b>one challenge.</b>

22:39.684 --> 22:40.924
<b>I'm not gonna mess up this one.</b>

22:41.019 --> 22:43.021
<b>My canvas originally wanted</b>
<b>a full-length mermaid,</b>

22:43.121 --> 22:45.490
<b> <i>but I was able to talk her into</i> </b>
<b> <i>a very beautiful face</i> </b>

22:45.590 --> 22:46.725
<b> <i>with pearls and a headband.</i> </b>

22:46.825 --> 22:48.585
<b> <i>Any tattoo on the thigh</i> </b>
<b> <i>has to be pretty big,</i> </b>

22:48.627 --> 22:50.362
<b> <i>and this is difficult skin.</i> </b>

22:50.462 --> 22:51.630
<b>- Hey, Sausage.</b>

22:51.730 --> 22:54.065
<b>Look at that.</b>
<b>Triggerfish, right?</b>

22:54.132 --> 22:55.600
<b>- It's not...</b>
<b>- No?</b>

22:55.700 --> 22:56.701
<b>- I don't think it's</b>
<b>a triggerf...</b>

22:56.801 --> 22:57.836
<b>I want to say it's</b>
<b>a butterfly fish, but...</b>

22:57.936 --> 22:59.671
<b>- Okay,</b>
<b>'cause I'm usually right.</b>

22:59.771 --> 23:01.172
<b> <i>- Matti's trying to slow me</i> </b>
<b> <i>down in this competition.</i> </b>

23:01.273 --> 23:02.474
<b>I mean, who are you kidding?</b>

23:02.574 --> 23:05.644
<b>It's a really tough crowd</b>
<b>and you have to fight.</b>

23:05.744 --> 23:08.113
<b> <i>This should prove to Matti</i> </b>
<b> <i>that I'm no one to mess with</i> </b>

23:08.213 --> 23:10.053
<b>and that I'm a better</b>
<b>tattoo artist than he is.</b>

23:13.552 --> 23:15.954
<b>- After all the [bleep]</b>
<b>I gave Sausage in season four,</b>

23:16.087 --> 23:17.389
<b> <i>I know he's gunning for me.</i> </b>

23:17.489 --> 23:20.125
<b>We're gonna duke this out</b>
<b>and may the better man win.</b>

23:20.225 --> 23:22.661
<b>- And it would not hurt</b>
<b>my feelings if he went home.</b>

23:22.761 --> 23:23.695
<b>I left my daughter to be here</b>

23:23.795 --> 23:25.697
<b>and I need to come back</b>
<b>a champion.</b>

23:25.797 --> 23:27.832
<b> <i>There's no point</i> </b>
<b> <i>in wasting time.</i> </b>

23:27.933 --> 23:29.568
<b>- Hey, Marq, how's it going?</b>

23:29.668 --> 23:31.369
<b> <i>Of course I'm gunning</i> </b>
<b> <i>for the veteran artists,</i> </b>

38:36.609 --> 38:38.890
<b>Of course, but I mean, I'm not</b>
<b>gonna go cry in the corner.</b>

38:40.380 --> 38:43.082
<b>- Jime. The face in this</b>
<b>is actually really nice,</b>

38:43.183 --> 38:45.118
<b>but the space seems</b>
<b>a little remedial.</b>

38:45.218 --> 38:46.618
<b>- If you would've done</b>
<b>your style...</b>

38:46.653 --> 38:49.255
<b>Jime Litwalk's face</b>
<b>on top of this face...</b>

38:49.355 --> 38:50.757
<b>you probably would've had</b>
<b>the best tattoo of the day.</b>

38:50.857 --> 38:52.692
<b>- But I don't know when</b>
<b>to do my thing.</b>

38:52.792 --> 38:55.161
<b>The idea of being</b>
<b>on a competition like this</b>

38:55.261 --> 38:57.063
<b>is to show people that</b>
<b>you are versatile,</b>

38:57.096 --> 38:58.431
<b>that you can step</b>
<b>out of the box.</b>

38:58.531 --> 39:00.011
<b>- Play the game</b>
<b>to your own advantage.</b>

39:00.066 --> 39:01.768
<b>Don't get yoked up in the noose.</b>

39:02.869 --> 39:05.638
<b>- Sarah, you had</b>
<b>a great challenge laid out,</b>

39:05.738 --> 39:07.841
<b>but it's hard to read,</b>
<b>it's confusing,</b>

39:07.941 --> 39:09.976
<b>it doesn't tell the story</b>
<b>of what it was supposed to be.</b>

39:10.076 --> 39:11.211
<b>It's just a rough one.</b>

39:11.311 --> 39:13.546
<b>- I tattooed like I was</b>
<b>working on lighter skin.</b>

39:13.646 --> 39:15.281
<b>I didn't take the skin color</b>
<b>into consideration.</b>

39:15.381 --> 39:16.883
<b>- How would you not take</b>
<b>skin color into consideration?</b>

39:16.983 --> 39:20.453
<b>You completely put yourself</b>
<b>before you canvas,</b>

39:20.553 --> 39:22.153
<b>so you were my pick</b>
<b>coming to the bottom.</b>

39:24.824 --> 39:27.894
<b>- Do we have a decision as to</b>
<b>which artist is closing shop?</b>

39:27.994 --> 39:32.398
<b>- For me, Alex's is the most</b>
<b>unrealistic face of the day.</b>

39:32.499 --> 39:36.669
<b>- Cleen's, Jime's, and Sarah's</b>
<b>tattoo face is attractive.</b>

39:36.769 --> 39:38.705
<b>I don't see that</b>
<b>with Alex's tattoo.</b>

39:39.405 --> 39:41.407
<b>- Gotta vote for Alex.</b>

39:41.508 --> 39:42.041
<b>- My vote's for Alex.</b>

39:42.141 --> 39:43.409
<b>- Alex.</b>

39:43.510 --> 39:45.712
<b>- Judges have decided.</b>

39:45.812 --> 39:49.682
<b>Alex, you do not have what</b>
<b>it takes to be "Ink Master."</b>

39:49.782 --> 39:52.685
<b>- Came into a season</b>
<b>that is the best of the best.</b>

39:52.785 --> 39:53.753
<b>This looks like a finale,</b>
<b>and you're here with them,</b>

39:53.853 --> 39:57.056
<b>so you made it far, man.</b>
<b>Don't bum out.</b>

39:57.123 --> 39:59.759
<b>Head up, always head up.</b>

39:59.859 --> 40:00.960
<b>- Please pack your machines</b>
<b>and close shop.</b>

40:01.060 --> 40:03.062
<b>- Okay.</b>

40:06.366 --> 40:08.401
<b> <i>I still feel like I had</i> </b>
<b> <i>the most wearable tattoo</i> </b>

40:08.501 --> 40:09.636
<b> <i>down there,</i> </b>

40:09.736 --> 40:12.172
<b>and that's why</b>
<b>I'm a little perturbed.</b>

40:12.272 --> 40:13.373
<b> <i>The tattoo was solid,</i> </b>

40:13.473 --> 40:15.675
<b> <i>and if anybody wants</i> </b>
<b> <i>to knock me for it,</i> </b>

40:15.775 --> 40:17.343
<b>you can kiss my [bleep] ass.</b>

40:20.613 --> 40:22.916
<b> <i>announcer: On the next episode</b>
<b>of "Ink Master"...</i> </b>

40:23.082 --> 40:24.083
<b>- We need to make a change.</b>

40:24.150 --> 40:25.084
<b>- She's gotta get out.</b>

40:25.151 --> 40:26.085
<b>- Yeah, I think it's clear.</b>

40:26.152 --> 40:27.153
<b>- All right, ready?</b>

40:27.253 --> 40:28.688
<b> <i>- A warrior never shows</i> </b>
<b> <i>his fear,</i> </b>

40:28.788 --> 40:30.290
<b>especially when he's in battle.</b>

40:30.390 --> 40:32.192
<b>- My tattoo is</b>
<b>[bleep] fantastic.</b>

40:32.292 --> 40:33.732
<b>- Bull[bleep]!</b>
<b>- I [bleep] nailed it.</b>

40:33.760 --> 40:35.320
<b>- We need to shake the ground</b>
<b>some more.</b>

40:35.395 --> 40:37.497
<b>- Throw everything we've got</b>
<b>at Sausage.</b>

40:37.597 --> 40:39.532
<b>- This thing is getting</b>
<b>so out of control.</b>

40:39.632 --> 40:40.834
<b>- It is not precise.</b>
<b>That's a problem.</b>

40:40.934 --> 40:44.337
<b>- Of all the tattoos today,</b>
<b>yours is hard to look at.</b>

40:44.437 --> 40:46.172
<b>- I think Cleen gets a pass</b>
<b>a lot of times.</b>

40:46.272 --> 40:47.373
<b>- How is he getting a pass?</b>

40:47.473 --> 40:48.374
<b>- Yeah, what's up, Christian?</b>

40:48.474 --> 40:49.542
<b>- At least I got</b>
<b>the balls to say it.</b>

40:49.642 --> 40:51.177
<b>You want to get mad,</b>
<b>I don't give a [bleep].</b>

40:51.277 --> 40:53.637
<b>I'm a [bleep] grown man and</b>
<b>I'm gonna say what's on my mind.</b>
