the shark is yours.

Okay. Thanks.

06:51.367 --> 06:52.412

06:52.455 --> 06:54.239
A call came in

06:54.283 --> 06:56.633
after security
at an industrial office park

06:56.677 --> 06:58.940
in Hawthorne found the body
of this woman,

06:58.983 --> 07:01.333
Dr. Laura Nash,
shot dead inside

07:01.377 --> 07:03.335
one of the warehouses.
She was leading a team

07:03.379 --> 07:06.513
of engineers to develop
a short-range radar technology

07:06.556 --> 07:08.471
for the Department of the Navy.

07:08.515 --> 07:10.865
The only prototype
in existence was stolen

07:10.908 --> 07:12.475
last night from the warehouse.

07:12.519 --> 07:14.434
What exactly does this thing do?

07:14.477 --> 07:16.174
This.

07:16.218 --> 07:17.698
This was taken

07:17.741 --> 07:19.830
during yesterday's
testing session, not long

07:19.874 --> 07:21.484
before Dr. Nash was killed.

07:21.528 --> 07:25.227
It's like X-ray goggles,
but on steroids.

07:25.270 --> 07:27.055
Who are the tactical
role players?

07:27.098 --> 07:28.926
Marine Raiders. Master Sergeant

07:28.970 --> 07:30.841
David Maxwell was the
one wearing the headset.

07:30.885 --> 07:32.408
He's worked closely

07:32.452 --> 07:34.279
with Dr. Nash for the last
two years to develop this tech.

07:34.323 --> 07:36.586
Hawthorne PD
has cleared their alibis.

07:36.630 --> 07:37.935
What about surveillance footage?

07:37.979 --> 07:39.197
Well, the warehouse has
a closed-circuit system.

07:39.241 --> 07:41.156
So, Hawthorne PD's
still going through it,

07:41.199 --> 07:42.636
but they haven't
found anything yet.

07:42.679 --> 07:43.898
And what do we know
about Dr. Nash?

07:43.941 --> 07:45.508
Well, she was a single mom.

07:45.552 --> 07:48.990
We notified her daughter,
who's a freshman at Penn.

07:49.033 --> 07:52.036
I, um, looked
into Dr. Nash's background.

07:52.080 --> 07:53.124
Her husband died

07:53.168 --> 07:54.996
when their daughter
was seven, so,

07:55.039 --> 07:56.519
she's raised her all on her own.

07:56.563 --> 07:59.348
And they killed her
just to get the radar tech.

07:59.391 --> 08:01.611
KILBRIDE:
Which makes me think
that whoever

08:01.655 --> 08:04.701
is behind this is aware
of its capabilities.

08:04.745 --> 08:05.876
And they will either

08:05.920 --> 08:08.531
use it or sell it
to someone who will.

08:08.575 --> 08:10.533
FATIMA:Could you imagine if an
active shooter had this?

08:10.577 --> 08:11.534
It's terrifying.

08:11.578 --> 08:12.927
Well, it's not as terrifying

08:12.970 --> 08:14.581
as if one of our enemies,
like Russia or China,

08:14.624 --> 08:16.060
got ahold of it.
They would have

08:16.104 --> 08:18.323
the resources to reverse
engineer it and mass-produce it.

08:18.367 --> 08:21.065
All right, Agent Callen,
you and Hanna

08:21.109 --> 08:23.154
talk to Master Sergeant Maxwell,

08:23.198 --> 08:26.244
find out what you can
about this radar technology.

08:26.288 --> 08:29.378
Agent Blye and Investigator
Deeks will hit the crime scene,

08:29.421 --> 08:30.553
while Agent Namazi

08:30.597 --> 08:32.860
looks into this
team of engineers.

08:32.903 --> 08:37.734
We can ill afford to have one
shooter with this technology.

08:37.778 --> 08:41.521
God help us
if it's a whole army of 'em.

08:51.879 --> 08:54.446
Feels like I just lost someone
from my unit.

08:54.490 --> 08:58.581
Dr. Nash was a civilian,
but she was also one of us.

08:58.625 --> 09:01.279
Every successful mission
requires teamwork,

09:01.323 --> 09:02.629
including civilians.

09:02.672 --> 09:03.499
MAXWELL:
All she wanted was

09:03.543 --> 09:04.892
to give our Marines an edge.

09:04.935 --> 09:06.720
This radar tech's gonna do that

09:06.763 --> 09:08.591
and then some.When is the Department

09:08.635 --> 09:10.245
of Navy planning
on rolling this out?

09:10.288 --> 09:12.595
If it was up to me, our boys
would've had it already.

09:12.639 --> 09:14.597
You saw what this thing
can do, but Dr. Nash wanted

09:14.641 --> 09:15.859
to make sure it was perfect.

09:15.903 --> 09:17.774
Refused to sign off until

09:17.818 --> 09:19.080
every last bug
was checked out.

09:19.123 --> 09:20.603
Who's taking over
the project now?

09:20.647 --> 09:24.520
No idea. But if I made
the decisions, Kevin Tyler,

09:24.564 --> 09:26.087
Dr. Nash's right-hand man,

09:26.130 --> 09:28.219
her clone.

09:28.263 --> 09:29.438
Clone?

09:29.481 --> 09:31.962
The way they both went
about their jobs--

09:32.006 --> 09:33.398
diligent, meticulous.

09:33.442 --> 09:35.009
Even had the same mannerisms.

09:35.052 --> 09:37.446
Though I'd say
Tyler's more personable.

09:37.489 --> 09:39.622
Everyone loves him.

09:40.536 --> 09:41.929
Was he there yesterday?

09:41.972 --> 09:44.540
No. Just me, Dr. Nash,
and the two Marines

09:44.584 --> 09:45.802
I brought to help
with the tests.

09:45.846 --> 09:47.195
Tyler usually stays
back at headquarters

09:47.238 --> 09:48.849
to monitor
the test training analytics.

09:48.892 --> 09:51.634
Who else knows
about the warehouse?

09:51.678 --> 09:52.940
Just the names I mentioned.

09:52.983 --> 09:54.289
We keep an extremely tight lid

09:54.332 --> 09:57.335
on anything
related to testing.

09:57.379 --> 09:59.250
[knocking]

09:59.294 --> 10:02.253
You, uh, wanted
to see me, Admiral?

10:02.297 --> 10:03.820
Where is the report

10:03.864 --> 10:05.909
that I asked for
on the engineers

10:05.953 --> 10:08.085
who worked under Dr. Nash?

10:08.129 --> 10:10.174
Oh, I'm still interviewing them.

10:10.218 --> 10:13.787
What is taking you so long,
Agent Namazi?

10:13.830 --> 10:15.049
I have seen snails

10:15.092 --> 10:18.182
move through molasses
with greater speed.

10:18.226 --> 10:22.752
Um, uh, you know, it's just
a lot for one person, sir.

10:22.796 --> 10:25.755
And I'm used to Agent Rountree
being here, and so, without...

10:25.799 --> 10:27.235
He is not.

10:27.278 --> 10:30.542
You are. Get it done.

10:32.544 --> 10:34.634
Yes, sir.

10:36.070 --> 10:37.724
Did you catch the game
last night?

10:40.857 --> 10:42.903
Yes.

10:42.946 --> 10:46.471
Agent Rountree's sister
was ballin'. I mean,

10:46.515 --> 10:49.213
32 points, nine
boards, six dimes.

10:49.257 --> 10:50.867
And she hit the game winner.

10:50.911 --> 10:52.390
It's like

10:52.434 --> 10:53.957
she willed the Bruins
to victory.

10:54.001 --> 10:57.134
Should've called "bank."

11:00.355 --> 11:02.400
Right.

11:07.884 --> 11:09.320
KENSI:
Anything?

11:09.364 --> 11:13.934
Yeah. Got a big empty space
with a, uh, office

11:13.977 --> 11:17.372
and a bathroom up there, plenty
of storage, parking everywhere.

11:17.415 --> 11:18.678
I'm just saying,
if we ever strike it rich,

11:18.721 --> 11:20.723
you can have the garage
for your cars.

11:20.767 --> 11:23.552
I want my own
custom warehouse.Cool.

11:23.595 --> 11:24.727
I was asking
about the window.

11:24.771 --> 11:26.163
Did you manage
to get that open?

11:26.207 --> 11:27.948
Oh, yeah. No, that's jammed
with a layer of dust.

11:27.991 --> 11:29.732
There's no way the killer
came in through there.Okay.

11:29.776 --> 11:31.386
Well, in that case, they must
have come through the side door

11:31.429 --> 11:33.040
because that is the only
other entrance without a camera.

11:33.083 --> 11:35.216
Yeah, but there's no signs
of forced entry, which means

11:35.259 --> 11:37.871
the killer either picked
the lock or had a key.Hmm.

11:37.914 --> 11:40.308
So the test ran until 7:30 p.m.

11:40.351 --> 11:41.657
Mm-hmm.Okay, the coroner's report

11:41.701 --> 11:44.138
has Dr. Nash's TOD at 8:03.

11:44.181 --> 11:45.879
Which means the killer
came through that door

11:45.922 --> 11:47.576
some place
in that half-hour window.

11:47.619 --> 11:50.753
Except CSU says surveillance
cameras saw the Marine testers

11:50.797 --> 11:53.234
outside in the parking lot
hanging out until almost 9:00.

11:53.277 --> 11:55.366
See, that doesn't make any sense
because the parking lot

11:55.410 --> 11:57.412
has a direct line of sight
to the side door.

11:57.455 --> 11:59.936
There's no way they just
missed the killer walking in.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.547
Unless they didn't.

12:02.591 --> 12:04.419
I see a sparkle in your eye.
What do you got?

12:04.462 --> 12:06.987
Maybe the killer
was already inside.

12:07.030 --> 12:08.466
Maybe they came in

12:08.510 --> 12:10.251
while they were running
the tests.

12:10.294 --> 12:12.427
That's interesting.
When no one's paying attention.

12:12.470 --> 12:14.211
Someone could just slide
right in and then they hide,

12:14.255 --> 12:16.170
and they wait for Dr. Nash
to be on her own.

12:16.213 --> 12:17.911
Then they kill her.Yup.

12:17.954 --> 12:19.913
And they steal the radar tech.

12:20.740 --> 12:23.917
I like it. I mean,
I don't like it, but...

12:23.960 --> 12:25.353
I like it.

12:25.396 --> 12:26.789
MAN [over phone]:
Mr. Callen,

12:26.833 --> 12:29.618
this is Bill
over at Certified National Bank.

12:29.661 --> 12:31.228
We spoke a few days ago.

12:31.272 --> 12:32.795
Listen, I'm sorry.

12:32.839 --> 12:35.798
We can't approve your loan
application at this time.

12:35.842 --> 12:37.626
Um, hope your mother's okay.

12:37.669 --> 12:41.238
Call me back if you have
any questions. Bye-bye.

12:42.152 --> 12:43.153
Anna?

12:43.197 --> 12:45.982
No. Uh, a robocall.

12:48.202 --> 12:50.160
Stop. I know what
you're thinking. I told you.

12:50.204 --> 12:53.468
I am done trying to find any
of Hetty's other protégés.

12:53.511 --> 12:54.904
Okay.

12:56.688 --> 12:57.646
FATIMA:
Hey, guys.

12:57.689 --> 12:59.126
I, uh, just completed

12:59.169 --> 13:01.563
the prelim interviews with
everyone on Dr. Nash's team,

13:01.606 --> 13:03.521
except for one person--

13:03.565 --> 13:07.003
Navy Reserve Petty Officer
LS-1, Kevin Tyler.

13:07.047 --> 13:08.570
Dr. Nash's right-hand man.

13:08.613 --> 13:09.876
Mm-hmm.Why hasn't he
been interviewed?

13:09.919 --> 13:11.312
Never showed up for work today.

13:11.355 --> 13:14.445
It's his first missed day
in five years.

13:15.446 --> 13:17.666
Did you try calling him?His phone's off-line.

13:17.709 --> 13:18.710
CALLEN:
When was the last time

13:18.754 --> 13:20.060
somebody actually saw Tyler?

13:20.103 --> 13:21.975
Yesterday around 4:00 p.m.

13:22.018 --> 13:24.629
A co-worker ran into him getting
into the elevator to leave,

13:24.673 --> 13:26.109
but he didn't say
where he was going.

13:26.153 --> 13:28.329
And now he's missing,
along with the radar tech.

13:28.372 --> 13:30.679
Well, we find one, we may find
the other. Why don't you dig up

13:30.722 --> 13:32.724
whatever you can on Tyler?
Talk to his co-workers again.

13:32.768 --> 13:33.987
Maybe somebody knows something.

13:34.030 --> 13:35.292
Oh, and send his address
to our phones.

13:35.336 --> 13:37.599
I'm sending it
to you now. Oh.

13:37.642 --> 13:40.297
LAPD flagged his address
for a routine welfare check.

13:40.341 --> 13:41.733
It looks like
a neighbor reported

13:41.777 --> 13:43.387
that his door was left open
all night.

13:43.431 --> 13:44.649
So he's diligent
and meticulous

13:44.693 --> 13:45.912
but he forgot
to shut his door?

13:45.955 --> 13:47.348
How long till
LAPD gets there?

13:47.391 --> 13:48.566
The call's still
in the queue,

13:48.610 --> 13:50.655
so ETA's 45 minutes.

13:50.699 --> 13:52.266
Cancel it.
We'll go by ourselves.

13:52.309 --> 13:53.615
You got it.

13:55.138 --> 13:56.618
I mean, don't get me wrong.

13:56.661 --> 13:58.968
I love our life and wouldn't
change a gosh darn thing.

13:59.012 --> 14:00.361
And yet, this morning you wanted

14:00.404 --> 14:02.058
to change the garage
into a man cave,

14:02.102 --> 14:05.409
and now you want to turn said
man cave into a man warehouse.

14:05.453 --> 14:06.889
Just dreaming out loud, baby.

14:06.933 --> 14:09.500
Sweetie, I get it. I know
how you feel about the bar.

14:09.544 --> 14:11.024
I feel it, too.
I just really think

14:11.067 --> 14:14.244
that we need to prioritize
where we put our focus.

14:14.288 --> 14:17.465
And right now,
our priorities are...

14:17.508 --> 14:20.250
bringing a child
into our lives.

14:20.294 --> 14:22.949
I think I just found
the killer's hiding place.

14:22.992 --> 14:24.994
DEEKS:
Oh, thank God.

14:25.038 --> 14:26.822
I can't wait to leave.

14:26.866 --> 14:30.173
The place is literally
filled with rats.

14:30.217 --> 14:32.784
With a perfect view
of the testing area.

14:32.828 --> 14:35.004
Killer could've
watched the Marines go,

14:35.048 --> 14:37.137
and then move in on Dr. Nash.

14:37.180 --> 14:39.487
This person's good.

14:39.530 --> 14:41.184
Yeah.

14:46.973 --> 14:49.366
Not good enough.

14:53.370 --> 14:55.807
Kevin Tyler?

14:55.851 --> 14:57.897
Federal agents!

15:22.182 --> 15:23.313
SAM:Clear.

15:23.357 --> 15:25.489
Whoever killedDr. Nash

15:25.533 --> 15:27.013
may have come for Tyler, too.

15:27.056 --> 15:29.363
If that's the case,
what did they want with him?

15:29.406 --> 15:31.017
Maybe they wanted
the radar tech.

15:31.060 --> 15:32.235
And they used
Tyler to get it.

15:42.506 --> 15:44.465
What is this I'm looking at?

15:44.508 --> 15:46.597
It's an analysis
of the threads

15:46.641 --> 15:49.078
that Kensi and Deeks found
at the warehouse.

15:49.122 --> 15:52.386
This is a cotton twill that's
been soaked in dye processed

15:52.429 --> 15:54.649
from the leaves of
an Indigofera plant.

15:54.692 --> 15:56.346
In other words,
it is raw denim.

15:56.390 --> 15:57.652
Impressive.

15:57.695 --> 15:59.001
I was a Denimhead.

15:59.045 --> 16:00.350
Japanese selvedge was all
I wore in college.

16:00.394 --> 16:03.658
What in Sam Hill is
Japanese selvedge?

16:03.701 --> 16:06.139
We call them... jeans.

16:06.182 --> 16:07.401
KENSI:Oh, no.

16:07.444 --> 16:09.359
Actually, it is
much more of subculture.

16:09.403 --> 16:11.013
We take great pride
in our denim,

16:11.057 --> 16:12.493
especially the process
of breaking them in.

16:12.536 --> 16:14.930
Mm-hmm. We call it
"wearing them."

16:14.974 --> 16:16.192
And washing them.

16:16.236 --> 16:18.847
Oh, no, never wash them.

16:18.890 --> 16:21.197
DEEKS:What?
Gross.

16:21.241 --> 16:22.111
So gross.

16:22.155 --> 16:23.243
No, freezer is so much better,

16:23.286 --> 16:24.635
and it doesn't ruin the fade.

16:24.679 --> 16:26.681
Huh. Oh.

16:26.724 --> 16:28.639
I hate Los Angeles.

16:28.683 --> 16:30.250
DEEKS:
On that note.

16:30.293 --> 16:32.556
Well, it looks like
this isn't just

16:32.600 --> 16:34.036
any pair of raw denim.

16:34.080 --> 16:36.996
It contains a non-pigment
black overcoating.

16:37.039 --> 16:38.562
Okay, so, it's double-dyed--
black over indigo.

16:38.606 --> 16:40.564
That's right, and it looks like
the dye is still fresh.

16:40.608 --> 16:43.741
So just to clarify, these come
from a new pair of jeans then?

16:43.785 --> 16:45.526
KENSI:Most likely. I mean,
the initial dye

16:45.569 --> 16:47.354
would've already broken in
had they been worn

16:47.397 --> 16:49.399
more than a few times.But if they're new,

16:49.443 --> 16:51.401
why are there
threads falling off?Could have been

16:51.445 --> 16:53.403
cut at the hem, you know,
turned into shorts or something.

16:53.447 --> 16:54.970
Even knee holes
would leave threads.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.798
Do we know who sells them?

16:56.841 --> 17:00.628
Uh, a number of manufacturers
do, but I was able

17:00.671 --> 17:02.021
to trace the dye

17:02.064 --> 17:03.370
to an indigo mill based

17:03.413 --> 17:05.328
in Osaka, Japan.

17:05.372 --> 17:06.895
And the only
U.S. manufacturer

17:06.938 --> 17:08.766
that they've shipped
their fabric rolls to

17:08.810 --> 17:10.551
is right here in Hollywood.

17:13.902 --> 17:16.122
Of course it's in Hollywood.

17:18.254 --> 17:19.560
Hey, babe,

17:19.603 --> 17:21.692
I could really use
a new pair of denim.

17:21.736 --> 17:24.217
Yeah, I could use
a new freezer.Hey.

17:24.260 --> 17:25.566
You know what?Shopping spree.

17:25.609 --> 17:28.221
I'm down. Let's do it.Cool.

17:28.264 --> 17:30.440
No signs of forced entry.

17:30.484 --> 17:32.921
You think Tyler knew
his kidnappers?

17:32.964 --> 17:36.185
Oh, maybe they forced their way
in when he answered the door.

17:37.491 --> 17:39.710
Huh.

17:39.754 --> 17:41.886
Oh.

17:41.930 --> 17:43.888
Looks like our man was inked up.

17:43.932 --> 17:45.890
Tattoo tracing paper.

17:45.934 --> 17:49.851
He saved 'em?
That's a little weird, right?

17:49.894 --> 17:52.201
Well, some people hold onto it
if the tattoo is meaningful.

17:52.245 --> 17:53.985
It's like a keepsake.

17:54.029 --> 17:56.510
Isn't the tattoo the keepsake?

17:57.337 --> 17:59.513
When are you going
to get your first tattoo?

17:59.556 --> 18:01.297
How do you know
I don't have one already?

18:01.341 --> 18:03.734
Nah, you can't keep it
to yourself.

18:03.778 --> 18:05.997
Well, maybe I have it somewhere
that you just don't get to see.

18:06.041 --> 18:07.956
Uh, no, no. Never mind.

18:07.999 --> 18:09.305
I-I don't even know why I try.

18:09.349 --> 18:11.264
Well, I do.
You're a glutton for punishment.

18:11.307 --> 18:14.093
No denying that.

18:17.008 --> 18:18.923
Oh, got another one.

18:18.967 --> 18:20.969
"W, K, 4, L."

18:21.012 --> 18:23.493
WK for life?
Hmm.

18:23.537 --> 18:25.147
Could be a gang reference.

18:25.191 --> 18:27.193
Hmm. Tyler grew up in Venice.

18:27.236 --> 18:28.716
Lot of gangs in the area.

18:28.759 --> 18:30.152
2008.

18:30.196 --> 18:32.241
He would have been 16.

18:32.285 --> 18:33.982
Could be
an initiation tattoo. Fatima?

18:34.025 --> 18:35.375
FATIMA:
Yeah.

18:35.418 --> 18:36.941
Could you check
for any gangs in the Venice area

18:36.985 --> 18:38.769
that have the initials "WK"?FATIMA:
You got it, Sam.

18:38.813 --> 18:41.946
Anything about this crime scene
feel a little off to you?

18:41.990 --> 18:44.427
You mean the way things are just
tossed around, random?

18:44.471 --> 18:46.125
Where was he
when they took him?

18:46.168 --> 18:49.606
Was he, living room,
kitchen, back room?

18:49.650 --> 18:52.261
I'm starting to wonder if
this is a crime scene at all.

18:52.305 --> 18:55.046
You think Tyler staged
his own kidnapping?

18:55.090 --> 18:57.136
When was the last time
your kidnapper gave you time

18:57.179 --> 18:59.573
to pack up?

19:00.574 --> 19:02.619
Hmm.

19:03.533 --> 19:05.970
[Kensi gasps][Deeks whistles]

19:06.014 --> 19:08.147
Oh. See, now that is what
I'm talking about.

19:08.190 --> 19:10.018
Look at this.[laughs]

19:10.061 --> 19:13.021
I'm getting a very, uh, Marlon
Brando, The Wild Onevibe.

19:13.064 --> 19:15.806
Oh, you have no idea how wild
I could be with this bad boy.

19:15.850 --> 19:18.069
Uh, no, sweetie. That is
the title of the movie

19:18.113 --> 19:19.593
that Brando first wore it in.

19:19.636 --> 19:21.943
[imitating Brando]:
I could have been a contender.

19:21.986 --> 19:24.728
I could have been somebody.Yeah, take it off.

19:24.772 --> 19:26.295
Stella!

19:26.339 --> 19:28.819
And here we are.
These are the jeans.

19:28.863 --> 19:31.779
Wow. These are nice.

19:31.822 --> 19:33.563
425 bucks. Huh.

19:33.607 --> 19:37.176
What? For one, or do they come
in a pack of three?

19:37.219 --> 19:39.134
You know what? I really
feel I should try them on.

19:39.178 --> 19:41.441
You know, really get
inside the killer's mind?No. No. No.

19:41.484 --> 19:43.965
We can tailor those to
fit any way you like.

19:44.008 --> 19:45.488
Really wish you wouldn't
have said that.

19:45.532 --> 19:47.447
Hi. I am, uh,
Special Agent Kensi Blye, NCIS.

19:47.490 --> 19:50.319
This is my partner,
Investigator Deeks.Hi.

19:50.363 --> 19:54.149
Ruby. It's my shop.
How can I help?

19:54.193 --> 19:56.369
Well, we have a few questions
about these jeans in particular.

19:56.412 --> 19:57.761
The Palomas.Yeah.

19:57.805 --> 19:58.936
My best seller.

19:58.980 --> 20:00.721
Because they come
in a pack of three?

20:00.764 --> 20:03.854
Sticker shock.
He's not a Denimhead. [laughs]

20:03.898 --> 20:06.074
For what goes into a pair
of these, they're a steal.

20:06.117 --> 20:07.510
Mm-hmm.Unless, you know,

20:07.554 --> 20:10.861
you prefer mass-produced jeans
with stretch.

20:10.905 --> 20:13.516
Ooh.Oh. You mean range of motion?

20:13.560 --> 20:15.518
Oh, no, no.Little bit of that action?

20:15.562 --> 20:16.693
KENSI: Sorry.DEEKS: Huh?

20:16.737 --> 20:18.260
It's just, do you have
a customer list

20:18.304 --> 20:19.653
that we could possibly
take a look at, please?

20:20.654 --> 20:22.569
Sure thing. Be right back.

20:22.612 --> 20:24.527
DEEKS:
Thank you, Ruby.

20:24.571 --> 20:26.094
[inhales sharply]

20:26.137 --> 20:29.184
So, if everything in here
is incredibly high quality

20:29.228 --> 20:30.577
and priced
accordingly...

20:30.620 --> 20:33.884
Then customers aren't
hurting for money, so, maybe

20:33.928 --> 20:36.496
whoever stole the technology
isn't trying to sell it.

20:36.539 --> 20:38.628
Maybe they're trying
to use it.

20:38.672 --> 20:40.891
FATIMA:
White Kings.

20:40.935 --> 20:42.110
W-K-4-L.

20:42.153 --> 20:43.372
White Kings For Life?

20:43.416 --> 20:45.331
They're a white supremacist
gang in Venice,

20:45.374 --> 20:48.290
known for trafficking
narcotics and weapons.

20:48.334 --> 20:49.726
CALLEN:
Wait a second.

20:49.770 --> 20:51.467
Tyler had background checks
in the Navy and at Z3.

20:51.511 --> 20:52.947
Why wasn't this ever flagged?

20:52.990 --> 20:55.254
I don't know,
but if he can hide all this,

20:55.297 --> 20:56.690
imagine what else is out there.

20:56.733 --> 20:59.867
Fatima, go through
all of Tyler's units

20:59.910 --> 21:01.651
in the Navy before he joined Z3.

21:01.695 --> 21:04.088
See if anything unusual
comes up, and, uh,

21:04.132 --> 21:07.614
get me a list of all known
members of the White Kings.

21:07.657 --> 21:09.180
If Tyler's close
with these guys,

21:09.224 --> 21:10.791
I want to know who
we're dealing with.

21:10.834 --> 21:13.097
FATIMA:
Copy that.

21:14.621 --> 21:17.319
Beverly Hills,
West Hollywood and Malibu?

21:17.363 --> 21:20.104
We sure this is a customer list
or a membership to Soho House?

21:20.148 --> 21:22.063
Oh, come on. There are
plenty of Hollywood types

21:22.106 --> 21:24.283
who would like a simple thing
like a well-made pair of denim.

21:24.326 --> 21:26.807
Yeah, but how many Hollywood
types can break into a warehouse

21:26.850 --> 21:28.635
and steal high-tech
radar equipment?

21:28.678 --> 21:31.464
I'm thinking the Rock,
maybe even, uh, Jason Momoa.

21:31.507 --> 21:32.813
Ah, you're just fantasizing

21:32.856 --> 21:35.163
about putting them boys
in them jeans.

21:35.206 --> 21:36.251
I'm just dreaming out loud.

21:36.295 --> 21:37.948
Chris, uh, Hemsworth?[laughs]

21:37.992 --> 21:39.646
What just happened?
Why are you blushing?

21:39.689 --> 21:41.256
Nothing.Did you just have a stroke?

21:41.300 --> 21:42.170
Stop it.

21:42.213 --> 21:43.302
Did I just hit something real?

21:43.345 --> 21:44.041
Moving on.What is happening right now?

21:44.085 --> 21:46.000
Moving... on.Okay.

21:46.043 --> 21:49.264
So if we rule out people
that actually bought the jeans,

21:49.308 --> 21:51.527
then how is the killer
getting his hands on 'em?

21:51.571 --> 21:53.442
Donations.

21:53.486 --> 21:55.009
Donate what?

21:55.052 --> 21:56.793
What if the jeans
we're looking for

21:56.837 --> 21:58.621
weren't sold?
Maybe they were donated.

21:58.665 --> 22:00.057
Okay, I have a question.

22:00.101 --> 22:02.973
Who buys a new pair of jeans
just to give them away?

22:03.017 --> 22:04.584
Well,

22:04.627 --> 22:05.933
if you manufacturer clothes,
you always end up with seconds.

22:05.976 --> 22:07.413
Right.You know, garments
with minor faults

22:07.456 --> 22:08.327
that fail QC.

22:08.370 --> 22:09.415
I'm with you.Instead of

22:09.458 --> 22:10.590
sending them back,
what they do is,

22:10.633 --> 22:11.852
they either sell them
at a discount,

22:11.895 --> 22:14.158
or they donate them to charity.

22:14.202 --> 22:17.423
I didn't see any discount bins
in there, so...

22:17.466 --> 22:20.121
So, maybe Ruby is donating hers.

22:20.164 --> 22:21.514
Oh, Ruby.

22:21.557 --> 22:23.037
Shall we?

22:23.080 --> 22:25.866
KENSI:
Uh, excuse me, Ruby.

22:25.909 --> 22:27.520
I knew you'd be back

22:27.563 --> 22:28.651
to try 'em on.

22:28.695 --> 22:30.000
Actually, um, I have
a few more questions

22:30.044 --> 22:32.002
about those jeans.Shoot.

22:32.046 --> 22:34.657
Um, what do you do
with your seconds?

22:34.701 --> 22:38.095
Throw 'em in a box.
About every six months or so,

22:38.139 --> 22:39.662
give 'em to this guy

22:39.706 --> 22:41.664
who runs a community
outreach center in Venice.Wow.

22:41.708 --> 22:44.406
When's the last time
you did that?Maybe a week ago.

22:44.450 --> 22:46.103
And how did you meet this guy?

22:46.147 --> 22:48.410
Um...

22:48.454 --> 22:50.412
through my sister.

22:50.456 --> 22:52.196
Okay. Were they together?

22:52.240 --> 22:54.111
Not exactly.

22:54.155 --> 22:56.984
She had a...

22:57.724 --> 23:00.770
She had a problem
with methamphetamines.

23:01.771 --> 23:03.686
Oh. I'm, uh...

23:03.730 --> 23:05.775
I'm sorry to hear that.
That must've been really hard.

23:05.819 --> 23:08.256
Kaylee was my best friend.

23:08.299 --> 23:11.433
We did everything together.
I mean, if you saw

23:11.477 --> 23:13.696
how she used to...

23:14.523 --> 23:16.917
She wasn't even the same person.

23:16.960 --> 23:19.267
Were you able
to get her any help?

23:19.310 --> 23:21.095
We tried everything.

23:21.138 --> 23:23.445
She didn't want help,
ended up on the streets.

23:23.489 --> 23:26.622
And then she was taken in
at the community center?

23:26.666 --> 23:31.453
They have a no-drugs policy,
but Manny didn't care.

23:31.497 --> 23:33.455
Gave her a
place to sleep,

23:33.499 --> 23:35.457
wash up, hot meals.

23:35.501 --> 23:38.504
Treated her
like she was his own family.

23:38.547 --> 23:40.854
That's just who he is.

23:42.029 --> 23:43.857
So she's okay now then?

23:45.075 --> 23:46.207
No.

23:46.250 --> 23:48.601
She relapsed, and

23:48.644 --> 23:51.952
it was too much
for her body to handle.

23:53.432 --> 23:55.390
DEEKS:
Oh.

23:57.131 --> 23:59.655
I'm-I'm so sorry.

24:01.004 --> 24:03.006
Thank you.

24:03.050 --> 24:05.792
I'll never forget
what Manny did for her.

24:05.835 --> 24:08.011
I don't have much,
but I give what I can.

24:13.016 --> 24:14.235
Go ahead, Fatima.

24:14.278 --> 24:15.497
Well, it looks like all signs

24:15.541 --> 24:16.759
point to the White Kings

24:16.803 --> 24:18.674
having a casual org structure,

24:18.718 --> 24:21.634
which is why it's taking so long
to ID their members.

24:21.677 --> 24:23.592
Well, that could be by design.
Makes it harder to know

24:23.636 --> 24:25.028
who's running things.Well, makes it hard to know

24:25.072 --> 24:26.769
who the members are.
That might be why

24:26.813 --> 24:28.336
Tyler never got flagged
in his background checks.

24:28.379 --> 24:31.208
Or maybe he's just really
good at covering his tracks.

24:31.252 --> 24:32.688
I found several inventory errors

24:32.732 --> 24:34.864
at each location
that he was stationed

24:34.908 --> 24:37.214
during his time with the Navy.

24:37.258 --> 24:38.999
In most cases, several.

24:39.042 --> 24:40.566
And yet,
Tyler was never written up.

24:40.609 --> 24:42.219
What kind of inventory?

24:42.263 --> 24:43.830
Equipment, weapons,

24:43.873 --> 24:46.615
a few rifles here,
some body armor there.

24:46.659 --> 24:48.878
But nothing big enough
to raise any red flags.

24:48.922 --> 24:49.966
Yeah, but over time,
he's stockpiled enough

24:50.010 --> 24:51.446
to outfit a small militia.

24:51.490 --> 24:53.274
Where could he have kept it all?

24:53.317 --> 24:54.667
Maybe they sold it.

24:54.710 --> 24:56.625
White Kings were known
for trafficking weapons.

24:56.669 --> 24:58.148
Tyler could've been
their supplier.

24:58.192 --> 25:00.150
That means he could've helped
them steal the radar tech.

25:00.194 --> 25:02.326
But I don't get it.
If they've been running

25:02.370 --> 25:03.850
this scheme for years, you know,

25:03.893 --> 25:06.722
taking small amounts
from large-inventory items

25:06.766 --> 25:08.376
to avoid drawing attention,

25:08.419 --> 25:09.943
then why go
for the radar tech?

25:09.986 --> 25:12.989
It's one of one. It goes
missing, everyone notices.

25:13.033 --> 25:14.687
Well, maybe they didn't
care if they were noticed.

25:14.730 --> 25:16.166
It could have been their
chance to cash out.

25:16.210 --> 25:17.603
Then they'd need a buyer.

25:17.646 --> 25:19.518
Somebody who has the money
and wants the radar tech.

25:19.561 --> 25:21.041
And someone who's willing
to be charged

25:21.084 --> 25:23.173
with espionage
if they get caught.

25:23.217 --> 25:25.088
Well, a foreign operative
checks all three of those boxes.

25:25.132 --> 25:26.525
If that's the case,
they're not keeping it here.

25:26.568 --> 25:28.048
They're gonna get it home
as fast as possible.

25:28.091 --> 25:29.397
Fatima, check every
international flight

25:29.440 --> 25:31.225
leaving L.A.
in the next 24 hours.

25:31.268 --> 25:34.271
Narrow if down using facial rec,
anyone flagged by ONI.

25:34.315 --> 25:36.012
And focus on the regions
that have state-sponsored

25:36.056 --> 25:38.058
espionage operations.FATIMA:
You got it.

25:38.101 --> 25:40.277
So, basically,
Russia and China.

25:40.321 --> 25:41.365
Basically.

25:50.940 --> 25:52.638
DEEKS:
Manny Ortiz?That's me.

25:52.681 --> 25:53.464
DEEKS:
Hey.What's going on?

25:53.508 --> 25:54.596
Investigator Martin Deeks.

25:54.640 --> 25:56.685
This is Special Agent
Kensi Blye, NCIS.

25:56.729 --> 25:58.731
Hi. We'd like to, uh, ask you
about some donated jeans

25:58.774 --> 26:01.298
you received from Ruby over
at Schaeffer's Garment Hotel.

26:01.342 --> 26:03.213
Oh, yeah. Those are real nice.

26:03.257 --> 26:06.434
But you got to be crazy to pay
that kind of money for jeans.

26:06.477 --> 26:08.871
[laughs]My thoughts exactly.

26:08.915 --> 26:11.874
Hey, thanks again.All right, take care, brother.

26:11.918 --> 26:13.572
Who's that?Volunteer.

26:13.615 --> 26:15.095
Yeah, we got all kinds
of people helping out--

26:15.138 --> 26:16.575
carpenters, electricians.

26:16.618 --> 26:18.446
He painted the inside,
made it look real nice.

26:18.489 --> 26:20.622
Huh. And what's going on
here today?

26:20.666 --> 26:22.319
Uh, big event. We're
giving scholarships

26:22.363 --> 26:23.886
to ten high
school seniors,

26:23.930 --> 26:26.062
all from immigrant families,
first-time college students.

26:26.106 --> 26:27.934
Wow. That's amazing.It's incredible.

26:27.977 --> 26:29.283
Yeah, these kids have been
through a lot.

26:29.326 --> 26:30.414
I'm so proud of 'em.

26:30.458 --> 26:32.721
Anyway, uh, what
about the jeans?

26:32.765 --> 26:34.418
Oh, just wanted to know
what you did with them.

26:34.462 --> 26:36.812
Usually, I leave 'em inside
for whoever needs 'em,

26:36.856 --> 26:38.292
but those we gave
to the volunteers.

26:38.335 --> 26:40.076
We don't have any money
so we can't pay 'em,

26:40.120 --> 26:41.469
but we could hook 'em
up with nice stuff.

26:41.512 --> 26:43.036
Do you know which volunteers?

26:43.079 --> 26:44.646
Oh, they all got something.

26:44.690 --> 26:46.213
My only rule is, don't take it
if you're not gonna wear it.

26:46.256 --> 26:47.562
Any way to get their names?

26:47.606 --> 26:49.346
We don't take names.

26:49.390 --> 26:50.652
We take anybody who will help.

26:50.696 --> 26:51.827
But I will see
what I can do for you.

26:51.871 --> 26:53.742
It's appreciated.That'll be great.

26:53.786 --> 26:55.222
Thank you.Yeah. Yeah.

26:55.265 --> 26:57.659
Keep up the great work.

26:57.703 --> 26:59.530
So, I ran the names
on all the flights

26:59.574 --> 27:01.010
out of L.A. through ONI.

27:01.054 --> 27:02.838
And then I checked those
against the countries

27:02.882 --> 27:06.146
that are most likely to target
us in an espionage attack,

27:06.189 --> 27:08.017
and one name kept popping up.

27:08.061 --> 27:10.498
Jun Chen.
She's actually leaving L.A.

27:10.541 --> 27:12.674
tonight on a flight
to Lisbon.

27:12.718 --> 27:14.328
She's a professor
from a university in Shanghai.

27:14.371 --> 27:15.546
What's she doing here?

27:15.590 --> 27:17.200
She's a visiting
professor teaching

27:17.244 --> 27:18.767
Chinese language courses.

27:18.811 --> 27:21.248
But she's been here five times
in the last three years

27:21.291 --> 27:23.293
on a series of work visas.

27:23.337 --> 27:24.817
Where is she teaching?

27:24.860 --> 27:26.166
Different universities
across the country.

27:26.209 --> 27:27.646
I haven't found
anything really unique

27:27.689 --> 27:29.082
that they share in common

27:29.125 --> 27:30.605
except for their proximity

27:30.649 --> 27:33.173
to a naval base
or a defense contractor.

27:33.216 --> 27:34.391
But...

27:34.435 --> 27:36.437
get this.
ONI, with the help

27:36.480 --> 27:39.614
of Scotland Yard, discovered
a spy network operating out

27:39.658 --> 27:41.224
of North America and Europe.

27:41.268 --> 27:44.880
Now, every place
she's been to is on their list.

27:44.924 --> 27:46.447
Well, that fits
a lot of markers

27:46.490 --> 27:47.970
of the PRC Ministry
of State Security.

27:48.014 --> 27:49.929
Why hasn't she
been arrested?

27:49.972 --> 27:52.540
They just hadn't been able
to piece it all together yet.

27:52.583 --> 27:53.933
[tablet beeps]

27:53.976 --> 27:55.151
Oh, well,

27:55.195 --> 27:56.849
facial rec has her entering
a nail salon

27:56.892 --> 27:59.068
in Marina Del Rey
20 minutes ago.

27:59.112 --> 28:00.461
Agent Castor and his partner are
in the area.

28:00.504 --> 28:01.810
All right, have Castor swing by,

28:01.854 --> 28:03.072
pick her up, give her a ride
to the boatshed.

28:03.116 --> 28:04.944
We'll head over there.You got it.

28:10.471 --> 28:11.733
I do not understand.

28:11.777 --> 28:13.735
I am a visiting professor
from Shanghai.

28:13.779 --> 28:15.563
But that's not why you're here.

28:15.606 --> 28:16.825
I have a work visa.

28:16.869 --> 28:18.435
Five cities in the U.S.,
four more in Europe.

28:18.479 --> 28:19.828
We know what you did
at each stop.

28:19.872 --> 28:21.177
And we know what you're
doing here in L.A.

28:21.221 --> 28:22.744
KILBRIDE:
Tell me you found something

28:22.788 --> 28:25.094
on this Chinese
operative we can use.

28:25.138 --> 28:27.314
I mean, I don't think I've ever
seen a cover this good.

28:27.357 --> 28:29.142
I mean, it's like
she's a ghost.

28:29.185 --> 28:31.100
I mean, the only thing
I could find was an address

28:31.144 --> 28:33.799
for her parents'
apartment building in Shanghai.

28:33.842 --> 28:35.104
SAM:
Why don't you come clean?

28:35.148 --> 28:37.193
Tell us where the
radar technology is.

28:37.237 --> 28:39.587
What radar technology?

28:39.630 --> 28:40.980
Please, I have a flight
to catch to...

28:41.023 --> 28:42.764
You're not gonna
catch that flight.

28:42.808 --> 28:46.202
When we're done with you here,
the FBI, CIA, NSA--

28:46.246 --> 28:47.856
they're all gonna want to
have a few minutes with you.

28:47.900 --> 28:49.292
FATIMA:
But I did find

28:49.336 --> 28:51.947
something interesting
about the apartment building.

28:51.991 --> 28:53.775
Half of the tenants
that live there

28:53.819 --> 28:56.082
are from the same farming
village in Hunan province.

28:56.125 --> 28:57.474
It's the home

28:57.518 --> 28:59.650
of a phosphate mining
and fertilizer company.Hmm.

28:59.694 --> 29:01.914
You're gonna spend the rest
of your life in prison.

29:01.957 --> 29:03.654
Now it's up
to you to decide

29:03.698 --> 29:06.396
how comfortable
that stay will be.

29:06.440 --> 29:09.225
FATIMA:
Oh, wow. Uh,

29:09.269 --> 29:11.488
according to hospital records,

29:11.532 --> 29:14.622
uh, the cancer rate has doubled
in the last 20 years.

29:14.665 --> 29:17.059
Ever since the company
began operating.

29:17.103 --> 29:19.496
Where is it?

29:25.111 --> 29:26.416
Those callouses

29:26.460 --> 29:28.549
and scars on your hands.

29:28.592 --> 29:29.942
You didn't get those

29:29.985 --> 29:31.552
from spending endless hours
in the library.

29:31.595 --> 29:34.598
SAM:
Those come from long
hours in the fields,

29:34.642 --> 29:36.296
under tough conditions.

29:36.339 --> 29:38.124
Years of physical labor.

29:38.167 --> 29:39.516
CALLEN:
The kind people do

29:39.560 --> 29:41.780
every day
in small farming villages.

29:41.823 --> 29:43.651
You find labor to be shameful?

29:43.694 --> 29:46.306
I grew up working with my hands.

29:46.349 --> 29:47.829
There's nothing
shameful about it.

29:47.873 --> 29:49.526
CALLEN:
There's also no shame in wanting

29:49.570 --> 29:52.747
to leave a village
that's become a toxic dump site.

29:52.791 --> 29:58.361
SAM:
A lot of people dying,
more than should be.

29:58.405 --> 29:59.928
Most don't do anything about it.

29:59.972 --> 30:00.973
But you did.

30:01.016 --> 30:02.539
You got out,

30:02.583 --> 30:04.367
you got to the city, you got
educated, you met people,

30:04.411 --> 30:06.935
you... carved out a niche
for yourself.

30:08.154 --> 30:09.633
SAM:Right?

30:09.677 --> 30:12.332
Now, you want to do
the same thing for your parents,

30:12.375 --> 30:15.074
other people
in the village?

30:15.117 --> 30:18.468
Get them out too, hmm?

30:18.512 --> 30:20.427
That's how it
works, right?

30:20.470 --> 30:22.385
You help out
the government,

30:22.429 --> 30:25.171
they help out the
people you care about.

30:26.128 --> 30:28.783
Until you get caught.

30:28.827 --> 30:32.918
Then they'll kill you
to keep you from talking.

30:32.961 --> 30:34.528
SAM:Listen.

30:37.661 --> 30:40.229
We can help protect you
on the inside,

30:40.273 --> 30:42.971
keep you safe.

30:43.885 --> 30:48.020
Maybe in time,
even help your loved ones.

30:50.065 --> 30:52.154
First, you got to help us.

30:55.549 --> 30:59.335
If this fairy tale
of yours was true,

30:59.379 --> 31:02.382
and I am the person
you claim,

31:02.425 --> 31:04.688
then you already know

31:04.732 --> 31:08.475
that I am at peace dying
in one of your prisons.

31:08.518 --> 31:10.694
Because in this fairy tale,

31:10.738 --> 31:13.872
it would be many times worse
for me

31:13.915 --> 31:15.656
and the people I love

31:15.699 --> 31:18.528
if my government knew I gave up

31:18.572 --> 31:20.226
the radar technology.

31:24.578 --> 31:27.929
I will not tell you
where it is.

31:29.583 --> 31:31.237
[Callen sighs]

31:32.586 --> 31:35.067
But I will help you.

31:40.115 --> 31:41.812
The person

31:41.856 --> 31:44.163
who sold it to you?

31:44.206 --> 31:45.686
Give us a name.

31:45.729 --> 31:47.731
It was two men.

31:47.775 --> 31:50.386
And in my line of business,

31:50.430 --> 31:51.997
we do not ask for names.

31:53.999 --> 31:56.523
Is that one of 'em?Yes.

31:56.566 --> 31:58.394
He was the younger man.

31:58.438 --> 31:59.830
What about the other one?

31:59.874 --> 32:01.223
The other man was much older,

32:01.267 --> 32:03.660
like a father to a son.

32:04.923 --> 32:06.750
How much did you pay 'em?

32:06.794 --> 32:09.666
$2 million.

32:10.450 --> 32:12.931
But the older man--

32:12.974 --> 32:15.411
he wanted something more.

32:15.455 --> 32:17.805
What did he want?

32:19.633 --> 32:21.635
Devil's Wrath.

32:21.678 --> 32:22.679
What is it?

32:22.723 --> 32:24.594
All right, thanks.
The bomb techs

32:24.638 --> 32:25.944
I train with said
it's an explosive

32:25.987 --> 32:27.771
that China's supposed
to be working on.

32:27.815 --> 32:29.425
High-intensity,
no trace residue.

32:29.469 --> 32:31.993
An untraceable explosive.
Why aren't we seeing more of it?

32:32.037 --> 32:33.647
It's unstable.
You can't detonate it

32:33.690 --> 32:34.865
with a cell phone
trigger. You got to be

32:34.909 --> 32:36.476
within a couple
of hundred yards.

32:36.519 --> 32:39.783
Hey, guys, I just spoke
with my contact over at ATF.

32:39.827 --> 32:42.830
He's worked the Venice
gang scene for years.

32:42.873 --> 32:44.571
He knows all
about the White Kings.

32:44.614 --> 32:47.008
He said a man named
Seth Wilcox is kind of

32:47.052 --> 32:48.879
like their O.G. godfather.

32:48.923 --> 32:50.881
He served four and a half years
at Pelican Bay

32:50.925 --> 32:52.492
for a felony weapons charge.

32:52.535 --> 32:53.972
Got out last year.

32:54.015 --> 32:56.931
Isn't that the painter--
the guy with the blue flannel?

32:56.975 --> 32:58.889
Yeah, that's him.
Hey, guys, we just saw

32:58.933 --> 33:01.501
Wilcox leaving a community
center in Venice. He was

33:01.544 --> 33:03.155
painting the inside for an event
they're having today.

33:03.198 --> 33:05.026
What kind of event?DEEKS:
They're awarding

33:05.070 --> 33:06.854
college scholarships
to graduating seniors

33:06.897 --> 33:08.116
from immigrant families.

33:08.160 --> 33:10.031
SAM:
Immigrants.

33:10.075 --> 33:11.293
Non-citizens, DREAMers.

33:11.337 --> 33:12.947
That's right in
Wilcox's backyard.

33:12.991 --> 33:14.557
FATIMA:
And he's got to hate that.

33:14.601 --> 33:16.037
So why would he help them?

33:16.081 --> 33:19.127
Maybe he's there
for some other reason.

33:19.171 --> 33:22.043
Wilcox could be trying
to blow up the community center.

33:22.087 --> 33:23.827
DEEKS: I mean,
he could've planted the bomb

33:23.871 --> 33:25.438
while he was inside painting.

33:25.481 --> 33:26.482
Yeah, but they were cleaning
the place out to get it ready.

33:26.526 --> 33:28.006
Wouldn't somebody
have found it?

33:28.049 --> 33:29.659
Nobody's gonna bother a
painter patching up a hole.

33:29.703 --> 33:32.575
He could have put the bomb in
the drywall. Call the center,

33:32.619 --> 33:34.186
tell them to evacuate now.I already did,

33:34.229 --> 33:35.839
but no one's answering,
and the event's about to start.

33:35.883 --> 33:37.319
We got to get down there.

33:37.363 --> 33:38.494
On our way.

33:47.634 --> 33:49.549
We're pulling in now.

33:49.592 --> 33:51.681
DEEKS:Looks like it's
about to get started.

33:51.725 --> 33:53.553
We got no sign of Wilcox

33:53.596 --> 33:55.207
or Tyler.

33:55.250 --> 33:57.383
You guys go inside and start
evacuating. We'll look for 'em.

33:57.426 --> 33:59.602
KENSI:
Copy that.

34:03.171 --> 34:05.130
They'll want to take off
as soon as they detonate.

34:05.173 --> 34:06.696
They got to be in
one of these cars.

34:06.740 --> 34:08.698
Well, unless they went
into the community center,

34:08.742 --> 34:11.136
make sure it's full of people
before they blow it.

34:12.398 --> 34:13.616
Got 'em.

34:13.660 --> 34:15.053
Three o'clock.

34:16.576 --> 34:17.925
That road dead-ends
to the alley.

34:17.968 --> 34:19.274
We'll take 'em
from behind.

That is good to know.

35:53.325 --> 35:55.979
Um, let us know if
you find anything else.

35:56.023 --> 35:59.113
Wow. Well, it looks like

35:59.157 --> 36:00.810
Seth Wilcox and Kevin
Tyler were planning

36:00.854 --> 36:02.334
to make a run for it.

36:02.377 --> 36:04.162
LAPD found fake passports,

36:04.205 --> 36:06.468
$2 million in
small bills,

36:06.512 --> 36:08.383
and more of those
Chinese explosives

36:08.427 --> 36:11.647
stashed away at a hotel
near Tyler's house.Hmm.

36:11.691 --> 36:13.823
They also found a
pair of Paloma jeans

36:13.867 --> 36:16.565
in Wilcox's bag,
cut off at the hem.

36:16.609 --> 36:18.654
Hmm.

36:18.698 --> 36:20.308
Well, he must have
gotten the jeans

36:20.352 --> 36:23.398
volunteering
at the community center.

36:23.442 --> 36:25.879
Then wore them to the warehouse.

36:25.922 --> 36:27.968
He killed Dr. Nash.

36:28.011 --> 36:32.407
Well, um, we managed
to stop a bomb,

36:32.451 --> 36:35.584
save innocent lives, uh,
recover Chinese money

36:35.628 --> 36:37.891

36:37.934 --> 36:40.459
and get Dr. Nash's killer.

36:40.502 --> 36:43.636
All things considered,
that's a pretty good day.

36:43.679 --> 36:48.031
All things considered,
pretty good is not good enough.

36:48.075 --> 36:51.034
That radar technology
is still out there.

36:51.078 --> 36:55.213
Right. Yeah. Yeah.

36:55.256 --> 36:58.433
But there's always tomorrow.

37:01.262 --> 37:03.221
DEEKS:
Now that was a party.

37:03.264 --> 37:05.266
Yeah.I feel like we became
honorary members

37:05.310 --> 37:07.268
of Manny Ortiz's family.Mm.

37:07.312 --> 37:09.052
You know, I was
talking to this girl,

37:09.096 --> 37:10.532
and, uh, she's attending
UCLA next year.

37:10.576 --> 37:12.491
I told her I'd introduce
her to Rountree's sister.

37:12.534 --> 37:13.753
She cannot wait.

37:13.796 --> 37:15.145
Yeah, well, I cannot
wait to get home,

37:15.189 --> 37:17.017
plop down on the couch,
put something on

37:17.060 --> 37:20.063
that has over-the-top action
and a nonexistent storyline.

37:20.107 --> 37:21.239
Really? I was
kind of hoping

37:21.282 --> 37:22.762
for more of a storyline
and less action.

37:22.805 --> 37:24.503
Well, you know what?
If we had additional space--

37:24.546 --> 37:26.461
say, for instance,
the size of a,

37:26.505 --> 37:29.595
I don't know,
two-car garage--

37:29.638 --> 37:31.901
we could actually do both.

37:32.859 --> 37:34.861
Okay, let's do this.

37:34.904 --> 37:35.992
On weekdays

37:36.036 --> 37:37.994
we park our cars in the garage,

37:38.038 --> 37:40.693
and on weekends
you have free rein.

37:40.736 --> 37:43.217
Can I put in a little TV,

37:43.261 --> 37:45.959
tiny little couch,
maybe a golden frickin' shark?

37:46.002 --> 37:47.526
You can have
a tiny little beach chair.

37:47.569 --> 37:49.049
Sold!Sold.

37:49.092 --> 37:51.356
Yes. [groans]What? What? What?

37:52.357 --> 37:54.184
I still got to tell Callen.

37:54.228 --> 37:57.318
Okay, let's go do it.No, no.

37:57.362 --> 37:58.972
I'm the one
that asked him to move in.

37:59.015 --> 38:00.669
I should be the one to tell him
he's got to move out.

38:00.713 --> 38:03.498
Okay.I'll see you at home.
You can pick the movie.

38:03.542 --> 38:05.239
How about The Wild One?

38:05.283 --> 38:07.459
Hey, Johnny,
what are you rebelling against?

38:07.502 --> 38:09.461
What do you got?

38:09.504 --> 38:10.853
[laughs]

38:10.897 --> 38:12.725
I can already tell
you're gonna be up all night

38:12.768 --> 38:14.030
thinking about this--

38:14.074 --> 38:17.338
how Tyler and Wilcox
got as far as they did.

38:17.382 --> 38:19.209
This didn't just happen
out of nowhere.

38:19.253 --> 38:21.081
This thing was planned
years ago.

38:21.124 --> 38:23.388
All Wilcox needed was someone
like Tyler to make it work.

38:23.431 --> 38:25.607
He's been molding him

38:25.651 --> 38:27.217
from a very young age.

38:27.261 --> 38:28.784
Yeah. Makes you wonder how
many other people out there

38:28.828 --> 38:31.004
are like Wilcox,
planting their people

38:31.047 --> 38:32.788
in law enforcement,
military,

38:32.832 --> 38:34.616
intelligence community.

38:34.660 --> 38:36.879
[phone buzzes]

38:38.403 --> 38:41.449
Oh. Kam's in town. I'm going
to dinner with her and Josh.

38:41.493 --> 38:43.973
You want to come?Can I have them
guess my tattoo?

38:44.017 --> 38:45.453
[laughs softly]

38:45.497 --> 38:48.326
You're right.
I'm a glutton for punishment.

38:48.369 --> 38:50.719
Told you.Hey.

38:50.763 --> 38:52.330
Yo.

38:52.373 --> 38:54.375
[sighs]

38:57.857 --> 39:00.947
Hey.Hey.

39:00.990 --> 39:04.037
Do you need something?

39:04.080 --> 39:07.388
Yeah. I mean, I don't know

39:07.432 --> 39:10.217
if I would actually consider
it needing something per se.

39:10.260 --> 39:12.045
Deeks.

39:12.828 --> 39:15.527
I got an offer
on the Squid & Dagger.

39:15.570 --> 39:17.659
Too good to
refuse. I, um...

39:17.703 --> 39:21.184
I'm gonna sell the bar.

39:21.228 --> 39:24.318
You're selling the bar?

39:25.319 --> 39:27.452
Yeah.

39:30.498 --> 39:32.195
Thank God.

39:32.239 --> 39:36.069
[chuckles]I don't... I don't think
that you, um...

39:36.112 --> 39:37.636
Sorry. I don't think
that you heard me.

39:37.679 --> 39:39.594
No, I heard you. Congrats.

39:40.465 --> 39:43.555
Right, well, then,
I don't... I don't think that

39:43.598 --> 39:45.339
you're fully understanding,
'cause if I... if I sell

39:45.383 --> 39:47.080
the bar, it means that
you got to find a new place...

39:47.123 --> 39:49.604
A new place to live.
No, I... I get it.

39:49.648 --> 39:52.781
It's just, it's a lot,
and you-you don't seem very

39:52.825 --> 39:54.217
fazed by that.

39:54.261 --> 39:56.785
I've had a little bit
of practice at this.

39:57.612 --> 39:59.788
Right.

40:00.963 --> 40:02.748
Just out of curiosity,
when's the last time

40:02.791 --> 40:04.314
you lived in a place this long?

40:04.358 --> 40:06.578
Never.

40:06.621 --> 40:09.798
In fact, I actually don't know
how I made it work.

40:10.538 --> 40:13.106
So why did you do it?

40:13.149 --> 40:15.369
Why did you stay?

40:17.327 --> 40:19.547
I thought
you could use the money.

40:20.374 --> 40:22.289
I know things have been
tight around here lately,

40:22.332 --> 40:23.943
and I figured
at some point

40:23.986 --> 40:28.164
you and Kens would want to buy
a house and... start a family.

40:30.645 --> 40:32.342
[laughs softly]

40:35.520 --> 40:37.086
Thank you.

40:37.826 --> 40:39.349
Yeah. Of course.

40:39.393 --> 40:41.656
You would have... you would have
done the same for me.

40:41.700 --> 40:44.050
In a heartbeat.

40:47.140 --> 40:49.490
You know, uh,
the house we bought--

40:49.534 --> 40:51.536
it's a two-bedroom,
if you want to...

40:51.579 --> 40:53.407
Not a chance.Okay.

40:53.451 --> 40:55.453
[phone buzzing]

40:58.847 --> 41:01.937
[woman speaking Russian]

41:03.852 --> 41:06.115
[woman speaking Russian on TV]

41:10.032 --> 41:12.165
MALE VOICE [distorted]:
Anna, you know how much
I love you.

41:12.208 --> 41:14.167
[computer trilling]

41:14.210 --> 41:16.169
[less distorted]:
Anna, you know
how much I love you.

41:16.212 --> 41:17.518
[computer trilling]

41:17.562 --> 41:20.434
Anna, you know
how much I love you.

41:21.217 --> 41:22.915
CALLEN: Anna, you know
how much I love you.
