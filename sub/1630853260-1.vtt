01:06.501 --> 01:11.506
Graffiti is special because
when you do art in your room,

01:11.549 --> 01:16.772
in your home, it's just for you,
and sometimes you make a show,

01:16.815 --> 01:19.905
exhibitions so more
people see it.

01:19.949 --> 01:22.386
But when you do in the street,

01:22.430 --> 01:24.736
you are communicating
with everybody.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.700
The first time
I started listening

01:31.743 --> 01:34.442
to hip-hop music,
I definitely just
liked it.

01:36.357 --> 01:39.969
The message was quite
very strong about how
people were suffering.

01:40.012 --> 01:42.276
And automatically,
I just said to myself,

01:42.319 --> 01:45.627
"This is exactly the kind
of music that can fit
what I'm living."

01:51.676 --> 01:55.506
The reason I love
fashion is because of
empowering women.

01:55.550 --> 01:57.247
They make the shirt,
and they're proud,

01:57.291 --> 01:59.902
and it's also something that
you can teach a lot of people.

01:59.945 --> 02:02.252
I mean, it's a skill
that anyone can learn,

02:02.296 --> 02:04.124
I think, if they put
their mind to it.

02:05.777 --> 02:07.562
I believe in women so much,

02:07.605 --> 02:09.955
and I know that they have
so much strength and courage.

02:09.999 --> 02:12.306
And I love to maximize
their potential

02:12.349 --> 02:14.395
because I know that
they have the potential.

02:20.966 --> 02:22.925
In sex trafficking
and violence,

02:22.968 --> 02:25.710
bodies are very,
very important factor.

02:25.754 --> 02:28.148
Most of the time when
the violence happen,

02:28.191 --> 02:31.020
somebody else is
controlling the body.

02:31.063 --> 02:33.718
When I'm
doing the dance
and movement,

02:33.762 --> 02:35.590
I am the controller
of the body.

02:35.633 --> 02:40.116
I am liberating myself,
and that physical experience,

02:40.160 --> 02:43.554
that this is my body,
bring an empowerment.

02:58.700 --> 03:01.224
Women-- angry about
economic, social,

03:01.268 --> 03:04.053
and political inequality
between the sexes--

03:04.096 --> 03:06.011
took their fight
to the streets.

03:06.055 --> 03:07.926
First of all, our bottom line is

03:07.970 --> 03:10.407
we assume that women
are equal human beings.

03:10.451 --> 03:12.061
We're not still
arguing about it.

03:12.104 --> 03:14.585
Human rights are
women's rights,

03:14.629 --> 03:17.371
and women's rights
are human rights

03:17.414 --> 03:19.895
once and for all.

03:19.938 --> 03:23.942
Study after study shows
that investing in women's
leadership and development

03:23.986 --> 03:27.163
is one of the smartest
investments societies can make.

03:27.207 --> 03:30.166
Treating women
as second-class citizens

03:30.210 --> 03:33.169
is a bad tradition.
It holds you back.

03:33.213 --> 03:36.172
Even though we have made
so much progress,

03:36.216 --> 03:39.088
there are stereotypes
and prejudices

03:39.131 --> 03:42.700
about women that are
just refusing to go away.

03:42.744 --> 03:44.267
But what about the
women's revolution?

03:44.311 --> 03:45.921
I think we're stalled.

03:45.964 --> 03:47.531
You think about
how far we've come,

03:47.575 --> 03:50.273
and it seems like, "Okay,
the problem's gotten worse."

03:50.317 --> 03:53.755
A shocking
and disturbing video
appears on social media

03:53.798 --> 03:56.366
of more than 30 men
allegedly gang-raping

03:56.410 --> 03:58.760
a 16-year-old girl
in Rio de Janeiro.

03:58.803 --> 04:02.111
200 teenage
girls were abducted by
heavily-armed men.

04:02.154 --> 04:03.852
23-year-old woman
in New Delhi

04:03.895 --> 04:06.768
was brutally
gang-raped on a bus.

04:06.811 --> 04:10.380
Malala Yousafzai,
a 14-year-old advocate
for girl's education,

04:10.424 --> 04:12.948
was targeted and shot
on her school bus.

04:12.991 --> 04:14.515
So if the problem's
gotten worse,

04:14.558 --> 04:16.299
clearly these strategies

04:16.343 --> 04:18.519
that we've been employing
have not been working.

04:18.562 --> 04:20.956
So we need to think
outside the box,

04:20.999 --> 04:24.307
we need to try those sort of
innovative, creative solutions.

04:24.351 --> 04:30.313
Art is one medium through
which you can address issues.

04:30.357 --> 04:34.535
We all appreciate a good song,
a beautiful painting.

04:34.578 --> 04:37.451
So the music of
art is universal.

04:58.689 --> 05:02.214
During the concert,
we get everybody out.

05:02.258 --> 05:05.261
And then from there,
you just give them information.

05:05.305 --> 05:07.437
And we gonna use
our music to put

05:07.481 --> 05:09.961
very strong messages
inside to give it to them.

05:10.005 --> 05:12.007
They will dance,
and they will learn.

05:30.025 --> 05:31.853
Okay, not bad. We go.

05:31.896 --> 05:35.683
When I started to make hip-hop,
I was not an activist.

05:35.726 --> 05:39.121
And it's only when I moved
from Dakar to Germany,

05:39.164 --> 05:43.952
I think I started to do
some kind of activism
to say I can use my voice

05:43.995 --> 05:47.303
for those one who doesn't have
the possibility to do so.

05:47.347 --> 05:50.306
We say good morning, Sista Fa.
Very nice to see you.

05:50.350 --> 05:51.873
Sister Fa is not a nun.

05:51.916 --> 05:53.788
She is, in fact, an award-winning

05:53.831 --> 05:57.095
Senegalese urban, soul, and
hip-hop star, and activist.

05:57.139 --> 06:00.185
Fatou Diatta, known
by her stage name, Sister Fa.

06:00.229 --> 06:03.754
She is breaking taboos by
returning to her home country

06:03.798 --> 06:06.322
to talk about this issue.
She joins me now.

06:06.366 --> 06:07.802
Thank you so much
for being with us,

06:07.845 --> 06:10.282
and thank you for
the really great work

06:10.326 --> 06:12.067
that you're doing around...

06:30.651 --> 06:32.435
I can say yes, but it's
just like the one behind
this one here.

06:36.047 --> 06:37.658
Yeah, this is your
family that you grew up with?

06:37.701 --> 06:38.702
Yes.

06:50.845 --> 06:51.846
Definitely

07:16.087 --> 07:21.615
I was the first girl who was
doing hip-hop as a singer.

07:21.658 --> 07:24.008
Then I was just fighting,
because in Senegal,

07:24.052 --> 07:26.968
it was not easy for a woman
to be in the hip-hop movement.

07:27.011 --> 07:30.275
We had no place,
because I think the producer,

07:30.319 --> 07:34.279
those people were, like, more
into how they can make money.

07:34.323 --> 07:38.370
With a lady, if she get married
and have children, it's over.

07:38.414 --> 07:41.722
And I did not even
wait for someone to
produce my first CD.

07:41.765 --> 07:43.375
I did it by my own.

07:43.419 --> 07:44.986
Yes.

07:51.514 --> 07:54.125
In Brazil,
people love graffiti.

07:54.169 --> 07:56.650
Grafitti is everywhere--
in the TV, newspaper,

07:56.693 --> 07:59.740
magazine. It's art. It's nice.

07:59.783 --> 08:02.786
They don't, like, call
the cops to arrest you

08:02.830 --> 08:05.267
because you're doing
graffiti. They like it.

08:05.310 --> 08:07.748
They're probably gonna
offer you water or coffee,

08:07.791 --> 08:10.098
ask if you need some paint

08:10.141 --> 08:12.666
to finish your wall.
It's incredible.

08:56.274 --> 08:59.364
And I think what's
happened to me is...

08:59.408 --> 09:05.762
I didn't want to accept
the position, to be a
girlfriend of the boy.

09:06.850 --> 09:11.376
The graffiti scene is
like... really for men.

09:11.420 --> 09:14.423
It's hard to be a girl inside
of the graffiti world,

09:14.466 --> 09:16.164
but she's doing really well.

09:19.080 --> 09:21.386
It doesn't matter
what you wanna say,

09:21.430 --> 09:23.388
if you go to the street
and write something,

09:23.432 --> 09:24.781
people are gonna read it,

09:24.825 --> 09:27.654
like a little kid, old guy,
a poor, a rich people--

09:27.697 --> 09:29.090
everybody's gonna see.

09:29.133 --> 09:31.962
You know it's like,
uh, democratic art.

09:53.680 --> 09:56.117
We have to look a lot
at what James Scott,

09:56.160 --> 09:58.249
an anthropologist, calls
"the weapons of the weak."

09:59.120 --> 10:00.948
All right, these are
weapons that people,

10:00.991 --> 10:05.256
who have no formal
political power, can employ.

10:05.300 --> 10:09.086
And in Brazil, of course,
the weapons of the weak have
always been the weapons

10:09.130 --> 10:11.785
of the popular classes,
the lower classes,

10:11.828 --> 10:15.353
and they've been things
like samba, music, humor.

10:15.397 --> 10:17.878
And graffiti fits
right in there.

10:57.178 --> 11:00.790
I love dancing like I love art.

11:00.834 --> 11:05.534
Any kind of dance,
poetry, music,

11:05.577 --> 11:07.884
but I'm passionate with
the dance from my childhood.

11:07.928 --> 11:12.715
I never attracted with
the stage performances.

11:12.759 --> 11:19.156
I love dance for self dancing,
and choreography,

11:19.200 --> 11:22.812
and how I can use
dance differently.

11:38.959 --> 11:42.963
I saw a poster
in 1996 with a poem.

11:57.238 --> 11:59.588
It was an
anti-trafficking poster,

11:59.631 --> 12:06.290
with a girl's face,
and I thought, "Yes,
this is my path."

12:08.162 --> 12:12.122
So, she learned about that and
immediately went to Sanlap,

12:12.166 --> 12:15.909
who was the organization that
she first started working with,

12:15.952 --> 12:19.216
and they were really
rescuing girls from brothels,

12:19.260 --> 12:21.523
helping them become survivors.

12:21.566 --> 12:24.526
And immediately
in working with them
and volunteering there,

12:24.569 --> 12:28.617
she began to recognize
that the way in which they
were treating these girls

12:28.660 --> 12:31.402
was very much in their heads,
but not in their bodies.

12:31.446 --> 12:34.449
And she asked the head
of the organization

12:34.492 --> 12:36.843
if she could try something
sort of experimental,

12:36.886 --> 12:39.802
and that was just to have
these women move.

13:18.885 --> 13:20.887
So then I thought,
"Okay, it's not working."

13:26.153 --> 13:29.765
The entire infrastructure
of a shelter home,

13:29.809 --> 13:31.680
the communication of the girls,

13:31.723 --> 13:34.291
the perspective, everything.

13:34.335 --> 13:40.471
I thought that I need to really
start to think the new way.

13:53.615 --> 13:56.836
And then they
started to tell their story,

13:57.488 --> 14:00.622
their life, they
started to talk.

14:03.712 --> 14:06.497
She had always been
an Indian classical dancer,

14:06.541 --> 14:09.022
and she saw
that the discipline

14:09.065 --> 14:12.199
and the whole use
of their bodies

14:12.242 --> 14:15.463
was quite empowering
for these young women,

14:15.506 --> 14:18.988
and it became
therapeutic in nature.

14:45.101 --> 14:46.407
And then I found that,

14:46.450 --> 14:49.279
"Oh, there is dance
movement therapy."

14:49.323 --> 14:51.238
It has a 40-years history,

14:51.281 --> 14:55.242
and I was kind of, "Wow.
I am on the right track."

15:26.099 --> 15:29.754
Okay, so I was thinking
today that you two could
be my team, and--

15:29.798 --> 15:31.756
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I have a skirt design

15:31.800 --> 15:33.845
- that I was gonna show you a sketch...
- Yeah.

15:33.889 --> 15:36.152
...and then see if you can
make a pattern to fit her.

15:36.196 --> 15:39.112
- Yeah, yeah.
- Do you wanna start the story of how we met?

15:39.155 --> 15:41.723
I wanna hear
from your perspective.

15:41.766 --> 15:43.333
Yeah.

15:43.377 --> 15:48.991
Okay, when we first
met with Anna,

15:49.035 --> 15:53.517
it was in the Metala church
where I used to go to church...

15:59.045 --> 16:04.354
And I told him that I
wanted to employ women to make
things that I sold in the US.

16:04.398 --> 16:08.184
And he said, "Well, why
don't you come over here
and start something?

16:08.228 --> 16:13.624
Because I started a training
program years ago, but it died
because there was no market."

16:13.668 --> 16:16.236
I felt like I could be
the connection to the market

16:16.279 --> 16:18.803
and design things
that I knew would sell
in the United States.

16:18.847 --> 16:21.981
It will just have a simple
waistband just like this.

16:22.024 --> 16:24.984
And then it will be
flared a little bit.

16:25.027 --> 16:27.638
- So the zip should be at the side?
- Yes.

16:42.088 --> 16:45.569
Could you start working
on the pattern today?

16:45.613 --> 16:48.572
- Yeah.
- Okay, thank you so much, Judith.

16:48.616 --> 16:52.489
The first time I went
to Kenya was when I was 16.
I was in high school.

16:52.533 --> 16:54.404
I grew up in Little Rock, Arkansas,

16:54.448 --> 16:57.451
but my parents
are very passionate
about caring for orphans.

16:57.494 --> 16:59.627
So we moved there
and lived in an orphanage,

16:59.670 --> 17:01.846
and I went to high
school over there.

17:01.890 --> 17:04.675
And then at 19,
I went to Rwanda

17:04.719 --> 17:06.416
and I saw Hope Village,

17:06.460 --> 17:08.331
and it's a child-run orphanage.

17:08.375 --> 17:11.204
I was 19 and there were
other girls who were my age

17:11.247 --> 17:14.294
and I wanted them to be able
to go to university.

17:14.337 --> 17:19.125
I went back to college and made
wire crosses from my dorm
room and sold them,

17:19.168 --> 17:24.086
and in a few months I made
enough money to send those
two girls to school.

17:24.130 --> 17:29.787
So that was the trip that
sparked my interest in using
my creativity to create change.

17:29.831 --> 17:32.660
How's it coming?
Looks great.

17:32.703 --> 17:35.141
Thank you.

17:35.184 --> 17:37.273
- Looks very nice.
- Yeah.

17:37.317 --> 17:39.580
The motivation
for Judith & James

17:39.623 --> 17:43.323
has been to employ these
women and help them.

17:43.366 --> 17:47.414
I feel for these women,
because I know they can
provide for their families,

17:47.457 --> 17:50.547
but many of them don't
ever have the opportunity.

17:50.591 --> 17:51.940
And I just don't
think that's fair.

17:54.421 --> 17:59.295
I started with Judith,
and we made a laptop bag
that turned out terribly.

17:59.339 --> 18:03.517
And they had no idea
what a laptop was or what
size it was supposed to be,

18:03.560 --> 18:06.911
but I assumed that they
knew what a laptop was.

18:06.955 --> 18:10.306
So there have been these
points where I realize
how far away I've been,

18:10.350 --> 18:12.221
and how different
our cultures are.

18:12.265 --> 18:14.441
It's so pretty.

18:14.484 --> 18:17.139
And then we made a skirt,
and the skirt was beautiful,

18:17.183 --> 18:19.968
and I took a few
things from Judith

18:20.011 --> 18:22.971
and a few things
that I had made
in my sewing class.

18:23.014 --> 18:27.149
And I did a photo shoot here
in Kenya with my little sister
and some of her friends.

18:27.193 --> 18:29.717
We posted the pictures
on Facebook, people loved it

18:29.760 --> 18:32.676
and said it looked
like an Anthropology,
which is always a good thing.

18:32.720 --> 18:36.027
So the feedback from
the US market through
a Facebook album

18:36.071 --> 18:38.682
is what really made me think,
"Okay, this could work."

18:41.729 --> 18:44.514
Female genital
mutilation is a reality

18:44.558 --> 18:46.516
for more than
a million women today.

18:46.560 --> 18:48.475
And despite efforts
to stop the practice,

18:48.518 --> 18:51.130
it's still prevalent
in many countries.

18:51.173 --> 18:54.089
The practice stretches from
Africa to South East Asia

18:54.133 --> 18:57.745
and to America where it was
outlawed almost 20 years ago.

18:57.788 --> 18:59.834
As the UN marks
the International Day

18:59.877 --> 19:02.837
of Zero Tolerance for
Female Genital Mutilation,

19:02.880 --> 19:05.883
one woman's fight
to eradicate the practice

19:05.927 --> 19:08.843
at her home in Senegal
and around the world.

19:08.886 --> 19:12.716
Female genital cutting
goes back 2,200 years.

19:12.760 --> 19:15.893
It is a practice that
we believe was started

19:15.937 --> 19:19.984
in Egypt by the pharaohs.
It was a practice that was used

19:20.028 --> 19:22.509
to control chastity
and fidelity of women.

19:25.120 --> 19:28.471
Female genital cutting is
fairly common in Senegal,

19:28.515 --> 19:32.519
mostly in the population
where they do it by tradition.

20:29.706 --> 20:33.449
Since 2006 my decision was
to work more with the kids.

20:33.493 --> 20:36.583
I think it's time now to get
the young people involved,

20:36.626 --> 20:38.019
because they are the future.

20:38.062 --> 20:39.977
If they get the right message,

20:40.021 --> 20:42.937
the right information, at school
where they are learning,

20:42.980 --> 20:46.984
I do believe that
in the very near future
we can have the solution.

21:18.668 --> 21:20.540
It became a social norm.

21:20.583 --> 21:25.066
There were expectations
for women to undergo
this practice

21:25.109 --> 21:28.156
if they were going to be
respected in the community,

21:28.199 --> 21:31.594
if they were to be considered
worthy of good marriage.

21:32.813 --> 21:35.163
The women became very
involved in this too.

21:35.206 --> 21:38.209
They wanted their daughters
to have good husbands.

22:45.799 --> 22:50.194
I'm sure you've
had an argument that says,
"Oh, it's people's customs.

22:50.238 --> 22:54.111
You cannot intervene,"
and I always say to people,

22:54.155 --> 22:58.159
we have to fight against
tradition and culture

22:58.202 --> 22:59.639
that is harmful to women.

23:02.468 --> 23:05.601
So, we are going to Lakhikantapur.

23:05.645 --> 23:09.039
We will be visiting
HASUS shelter home,

23:09.083 --> 23:11.738
anti-trafficking organization.

23:11.781 --> 23:15.916
And we run dance movement
therapy program over there.

24:16.716 --> 24:19.545
So trafficking in itself,
when we're looking at it,

24:19.588 --> 24:22.504
it's just the fact that someone
is being exploited

24:22.548 --> 24:25.202
and someone else is
benefiting from that,

24:25.246 --> 24:26.856
and it could be varied.

24:26.900 --> 24:29.946
I mean it could be for labor,
it could be for domestic work.

24:29.990 --> 24:34.908
But in sex trafficking,
minor girls are being taken
from their homes,

24:34.951 --> 24:39.303
young women are being
forced to come out

24:39.347 --> 24:43.264
and be put into brothels,
which are really absolute
hell holes to be in.

24:43.307 --> 24:46.528
And then they are being forced
to attend to these customers

24:46.572 --> 24:49.792
who come sometimes
10, 15, 20 in a day.

25:13.294 --> 25:18.473
I got kidnapped from Delhi
when I was four years old.

25:18.517 --> 25:22.564
I was taken from here
to there and people used
me like currency.

25:26.002 --> 25:29.353
I was just like a ten rupee
note passed from hand to hand,

25:29.397 --> 25:31.878
going from one place to another.

25:31.921 --> 25:34.533
That's how I was passed
from one house to another.

25:36.622 --> 25:40.364
At times when I woke up, I
found myself in dark rooms.

25:42.584 --> 25:48.024
I lived with my traffickers
from the age of 5 until
I was 13 years old.

25:48.068 --> 25:51.375
Then the police caught me and
brought me to the shelter home.

25:56.163 --> 25:59.601
Most of the children
who are trafficked

25:59.645 --> 26:03.126
into the brothels
and red light area,

26:03.170 --> 26:07.870
first, they cut off from their
body, the disconnection.

26:07.914 --> 26:09.611
They start to hate their body.

26:26.106 --> 26:28.456
Work with the body
is so important

26:28.499 --> 26:32.634
because when the exploitation,
the violence, and the abuse--

26:32.678 --> 26:36.551
anything that's happened,
it's a tremendous
physical trauma.

26:37.726 --> 26:41.295
We really do not
have that much tool

26:41.338 --> 26:44.603
available to work on
the physical trauma.

26:52.262 --> 26:55.875
Mercy? Yeah,
Mercy, can you show us
what you're making?

27:04.187 --> 27:07.147
We're at the workshop, and
these women are in training.

27:07.190 --> 27:10.063
And so teacher Jessica
is instructing them.

27:10.106 --> 27:12.195
And there is an engine
that they are going through

27:12.239 --> 27:14.894
according to these exams that
they take every six months.

27:14.937 --> 27:18.027
So they're just upping
their level of skills.

27:21.552 --> 27:24.207
I have two companies.
One is an LLC

27:24.251 --> 27:26.688
and one is a 501c3 non-profit.

27:26.732 --> 27:28.603
So, basically it's
like I have twins.

27:28.647 --> 27:31.824
So, the non-profit is a training
program for women in the slums.

27:31.867 --> 27:34.043
It's basically a sewing school.

27:34.087 --> 27:37.351
And we're hoping to add
more skills and more trainings
other than just sewing.

27:37.394 --> 27:41.964
And then the for-profit,
Judith & James employs women

27:42.008 --> 27:45.489
who have been trained and who
are skilled to make product--

27:45.533 --> 27:48.101
clothing and bags and jewelry.

27:48.144 --> 27:50.146
The pattern that--
did you make the pattern?

27:50.190 --> 27:51.626
Have you made the pattern yet?

28:07.990 --> 28:11.951
They're working on clothing for
themselves and their families.

28:11.994 --> 28:14.257
It's just for training.
So to show the teacher,

28:14.301 --> 28:16.346
just sort of
like homework,
class projects,

28:16.390 --> 28:19.175
and then they can do whatever
they want to with these pieces.

28:19.219 --> 28:20.699
But they're not
for Judith & James

28:23.440 --> 28:29.098
The community we started with
is called Gituamba slum,
and it's a wasteland.

28:29.142 --> 28:32.754
And these women don't
have many opportunities
for work in this area.

28:34.147 --> 28:36.410
One of them, for example,
was selling chicken feet.

28:36.453 --> 28:38.194
One of them was
selling tomatoes.

28:38.238 --> 28:40.327
One of them was
washing people's clothes.

28:40.370 --> 28:43.896
They just try to
find small jobs.
So, if they're at training,

28:43.939 --> 28:46.725
they don't have an opportunity
to go find a small job.

28:48.074 --> 28:50.424
So we started giving them
groceries every month,

28:50.467 --> 28:52.426
so that their food
is taken care of.

28:52.469 --> 28:56.647
And we did training
half a day, so that the
other segment of their day,

28:56.691 --> 28:59.259
they could do small work,
and pay their rent.

28:59.302 --> 29:01.957
Yeah. It's very smart.

29:02.001 --> 29:04.003
So nice.

29:04.046 --> 29:06.919
Tailoring can be quiet
confidence-building.

29:06.962 --> 29:09.269
First of all, it's
just really nice

29:09.312 --> 29:11.750
when you see that something
that you've created

29:11.793 --> 29:15.710
from zero has become
something beautiful and
someone can wear it.

29:15.754 --> 29:17.712
You can create
community with that.

29:17.756 --> 29:20.106
You can have a tailoring place,

29:20.149 --> 29:22.673
be a place that people
learn other trades,

29:22.717 --> 29:24.893
learn how to make things pretty,

29:24.937 --> 29:26.634
how to be able to package them,

29:26.677 --> 29:27.983
how to market them.

29:28.027 --> 29:30.203
They can learn the whole finance

29:30.246 --> 29:32.901
through something that they
have produced by themselves.

29:32.945 --> 29:37.123
So there are many ways in
which tailoring can become
an empowering thing for women.

30:11.505 --> 30:15.117
And this is why the
women are very nice,

30:15.161 --> 30:19.687
but at the same
time they are crying,
they are serious.

30:19.730 --> 30:23.386
She's in a kind of
prison, it's as I feel.

30:29.044 --> 30:31.351
Does this work have anything
to do with domestic violence?

30:31.394 --> 30:33.092
- I know that this is very--
- No. No.

30:33.135 --> 30:35.790
My work, this is what
people don't understand.

30:35.834 --> 30:39.228
My work, I don't paint
about domestic violence.

30:39.272 --> 30:41.274
For a long time, I know
Panmela had told us

30:41.317 --> 30:43.667
that she didn't want
to talk about how

30:43.711 --> 30:45.234
she'd been a victim
of domestic violence.

30:45.278 --> 30:49.456
This star, and there's
more stars here,

30:49.499 --> 30:56.332
is about the women
always dreaming different
things in their life.

30:56.376 --> 30:58.639
But it's interesting 'cause over
the last couple of years

30:58.682 --> 31:00.728
she said, "Now I
wanna talk about it."

31:00.771 --> 31:04.601
And I think that's
her own healing process
and being able to say,

31:04.645 --> 31:08.518
"I can teach people, you know,
through my own experiences."

31:37.983 --> 31:42.901
We moved into a house that
he had and when I moved,

31:42.944 --> 31:47.644
everything changed because
he felt that he had the power

31:47.688 --> 31:49.690
and he started
being aggressive.

33:17.038 --> 33:19.301
For me, it was hard
to go to my family

33:19.345 --> 33:24.306
and say that that
choice I made was wrong
and I want to come back.

33:24.350 --> 33:28.180
And I think,
as happened with me,
lots of women are in

33:28.223 --> 33:32.445
situations of domestic violence,
because they are afraid.

33:32.488 --> 33:37.754
They don't have money to
take care of themselves,
take care of the kids.

33:37.798 --> 33:39.800
There are lots of situation.

34:37.292 --> 34:40.426
We are here to meet Mehraj,

34:40.469 --> 34:42.471
so we are going now
to Mehraj's house.

36:21.527 --> 36:24.530
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

36:58.999 --> 37:02.568
People think body here,
mind is here, but it's not.

37:07.312 --> 37:10.663
It's one-self, and
dance has the power--

37:10.706 --> 37:13.535
physical, emotional,
cognitive, social.

37:13.579 --> 37:15.233
In this dance and movement,

37:15.276 --> 37:17.583
this holistical
self can come out.

38:00.278 --> 38:04.282
I think all women
should go for work.

38:04.325 --> 38:07.110
Money is very important.

38:07.154 --> 38:10.505
But using
my intellect,
my creativity,

38:10.549 --> 38:14.596
my passion, my capability
is very, very important.

38:14.640 --> 38:17.991
When you are working,
you are becoming much more free.

38:18.034 --> 38:19.949
You are interacting
lots of people.

38:19.993 --> 38:21.342
You are contributing.

38:22.952 --> 38:24.302
So the first training program,

38:24.345 --> 38:27.305
we had 14 women,
and it went for 18 months.

38:27.348 --> 38:30.133
And we had Pastor John and
his wife overseeing the program,

38:30.177 --> 38:33.267
because it was in their house.
Pastor John was a Kenyan,

38:33.311 --> 38:35.661
but he moved into the slums
voluntarily to reach out

38:35.704 --> 38:37.793
to people and to start
a church and to help people.

38:37.837 --> 38:39.360
And I had known him
since I was 16.

38:39.404 --> 38:41.362
He was a good family friend.

38:41.406 --> 38:43.886
And I initiated it,
and then went back
to university

38:43.930 --> 38:46.585
for the next two years
to finish my degree.

38:46.628 --> 38:51.372
We put Pastor John in charge,
and the women continued training

38:51.416 --> 38:54.941
under the pastor and his wife
while I was gone.

38:54.984 --> 38:58.336
Anna found out that
some of the money

38:58.379 --> 39:01.251
that was being put
into the training program

39:01.295 --> 39:05.081
or into the product development
was not being used properly.

39:05.125 --> 39:07.345
I did notice a few things,
like I would give him money

39:07.388 --> 39:11.174
for four sewing tables,
and there would be three
sewing tables,

39:11.218 --> 39:13.133
and he would have
a new desk in his office.

39:14.569 --> 39:17.398
But I tried not
be too concerned,

39:17.442 --> 39:19.531
because I knew he's
keeping the lights on.

39:19.574 --> 39:22.229
He's running this.
I'm not gonna be able
to be here on ground,

39:22.272 --> 39:25.363
so I really do need him to just
keep it going while I'm gone,

39:25.406 --> 39:27.452
and we trusted him.

39:27.495 --> 39:30.106
What was happening
was we were paying
rent every month,

39:30.150 --> 39:34.981
and of course the pastor
would say, "Hey, the rent's
going up, going up, going up."

39:35.024 --> 39:40.465
He was employing
the sewing teacher,
who we were paying,

39:40.508 --> 39:44.860
to make products that
the pastor's wife, Jackie,
was selling in the community.

39:44.904 --> 39:48.168
So she was starting her own
business under our roof,

39:48.211 --> 39:49.952
and the women in training
weren't learning anything,

39:49.996 --> 39:52.172
because the teacher
was so distracted.

39:52.215 --> 39:53.913
I mean, the whole day
she was in the back

39:53.956 --> 39:56.306
just stitching things,
stitching things for
Jackie's business.

39:56.350 --> 39:58.352
So we were paying
the overhead,

39:58.396 --> 40:00.615
giving money for the
women to have food,

40:00.659 --> 40:03.009
paying the teacher.

40:03.052 --> 40:05.011
But nothing was going
the way it was supposed to

40:05.054 --> 40:07.492
and the pastor was
just starting his own
business under the roof.

40:11.539 --> 40:14.063
In October when I came
back we talked to Judith,

40:14.107 --> 40:17.806
and I said, "Hey,
how much food are
the women in training getting."

40:17.850 --> 40:21.462
Because we were giving $500
a month for them to have
everything they need.

40:21.506 --> 40:25.814
And she said they're
getting one bag of rice
each, and that was it.

40:25.858 --> 40:28.556
And so the rest of the money
was going elsewhere,

40:28.600 --> 40:32.125
to a flat screen TV
in the pastor's house.

40:32.168 --> 40:36.738
It was definitely stressful,
and it was emotional.

40:36.782 --> 40:40.699
"I can't believe these
women are starving and
you're buying a flat screen."

40:40.742 --> 40:44.485
But John would deny it, and
his wife would also deny it,

40:44.529 --> 40:47.314
or they would try to explain
that's just how it is here.

40:49.359 --> 40:53.189
I think that not being here
to see what was really
happening on ground,

40:53.233 --> 40:56.149
I do believe that was what
drove me to wanna be here,

40:56.192 --> 40:58.499
to make sure that things
were happening the way
they were supposed to,

40:58.543 --> 41:01.241
to be able to build
into these women.

41:01.284 --> 41:04.418
So I do think that's a lot of
what drove me to live in Kenya.

41:05.680 --> 41:07.290
In Belosi?

41:07.334 --> 41:10.293
No, I've moved to another--
I'm in a small house.

41:22.741 --> 41:24.394
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

41:45.720 --> 41:48.201
Lukas came to make some study
of the Senegalese in music,

41:48.244 --> 41:50.333
and I was in Lukas' program

41:50.377 --> 41:53.946
as the first single lady
making hip-hop in Senegal.

41:53.989 --> 41:57.471
Then I was making a little
tour in the Casamance

41:57.515 --> 41:59.821
and he asked
if he can follow us.

41:59.865 --> 42:02.128
In that weekend we
decided to get married.

42:02.171 --> 42:04.870
It was crazy, but...

42:04.913 --> 42:09.178
I think it was
a concrete example
for me that in life,

42:09.222 --> 42:10.876
the person who we get married--

42:10.919 --> 42:12.704
You don't need to live
with a person ten years

42:12.747 --> 42:16.011
to be sure that
it's the right person for me.

42:16.055 --> 42:17.535
- And then you moved to Germany.
- Yeah.

42:31.331 --> 42:33.812
Do you think it's hard
for her when you're away?

42:33.855 --> 42:36.945
I don't think so,
because she knows
exactly what I'm doing.

42:36.989 --> 42:40.122
But when I'm back of course,
she's just like stuck on me

42:40.166 --> 42:42.560
like she don't trust anymore.
Even if I want to
go to the toilet,

42:42.603 --> 42:44.649
she want to follow me,
because she thinks,

42:44.692 --> 42:46.389
probably, I'm again going.

42:46.433 --> 42:47.390
But I think she's fine.

42:53.135 --> 42:55.834
...but this is my bed!

43:04.233 --> 43:06.888
In certain communities,
where Sister Fa

43:06.932 --> 43:10.065
has gone to talk about
female genital cutting,

43:10.109 --> 43:13.068
to sing about it,
to work with the children...

43:13.112 --> 43:15.331
She has had some pushback.

43:15.375 --> 43:17.769
I was in Guinea,
it was in 2013--

43:17.812 --> 43:21.729
I was in Guinea for a seminar
with artists from Guinea.

43:21.773 --> 43:24.645
I came back into Senegal,
and then we went to Fouta.

43:42.576 --> 43:46.624
My God, when we sent somebody
who was not of the ethnic
group up in the Fouta...

43:48.234 --> 43:51.672
he was-- they threw
stones and-- oh my gosh.

43:53.500 --> 43:55.545
Molly Melching told me that

43:55.589 --> 43:58.026
"You're going out to one
of the most dangerous part

43:58.070 --> 44:01.116
where we have
resistance in Fouta."

44:01.160 --> 44:06.426
But, do you think--
Aung San Suu Kyi, when she was
trying to stand for her right

44:06.469 --> 44:09.821
and the right of her population,
do you think she did not
know that it was risky?

44:09.864 --> 44:13.476
Or Gandhi?
To know that what
we're doing dangerous

44:13.520 --> 44:15.435
but should we just
cross our hand and say,

44:15.478 --> 44:17.089
"It's dangerous,
we should not do"?

44:18.394 --> 44:19.700
For me, it was clear.

44:19.744 --> 44:21.746
This is the right place
where we have to go

44:21.789 --> 44:23.922
to talk about child right
and woman rights.

44:39.764 --> 44:44.638
But the communities was,
with the mood, and there was
a lot of things going on.

44:44.682 --> 44:47.902
Population was really
happy in the community,
then the police said,

44:47.946 --> 44:51.601
"Maybe it's not
important to follow the tour.
Everything is going well."

44:51.645 --> 44:55.431
And it was at the third
locality, at Irae Lao,

44:55.475 --> 44:57.912
that the Khalif sent people...

44:57.956 --> 44:59.871
...to attack us
in the classroom...

44:59.914 --> 45:02.003
...because he did not want
the project to go on.

45:20.848 --> 45:23.546
Yeah, they attacked me.
I'm still carrying my scar

45:23.590 --> 45:25.461
on my hand,
because I was bleeding.

45:25.505 --> 45:29.509
They told me the Khalif said
that he don't want your project

45:29.552 --> 45:31.990
because we want the
girls to be cut here...

45:33.078 --> 45:34.079
and to be like good girl.

46:17.296 --> 46:19.602
I know he had seven, four girls.

46:19.646 --> 46:23.955
Umm Kulthum, Ruqayyah,
Fatimah, and Zainab,

46:23.998 --> 46:25.957
and no one was cut.

46:26.000 --> 46:28.655
The wife
of the prophet
was not cut.

46:28.698 --> 46:31.527
For me this is one
of the strongest argument

46:31.571 --> 46:33.834
to let women believe
that if you're not cut,

46:33.878 --> 46:36.619
doesn't mean
that you are dirty,
you cannot pray.

46:40.362 --> 46:40.972
Are you a Muslim?

47:04.778 --> 47:10.566
And people used to say
that all the bad things
that we have in the world,

47:10.610 --> 47:11.872
it's about women.

47:16.834 --> 47:23.841
And I use a lot of the
symbol of the apple that
is about the sin of Eve.

47:37.637 --> 47:41.989
I think the hair,
it's a symbol of the feminine,

47:42.033 --> 47:44.470
as the eyes.

47:53.435 --> 47:56.351
It's about a woman
that's so free--

47:56.395 --> 47:59.006
so free, we cannot
imagine this woman.

48:28.427 --> 48:31.952
When he forgot the cellphone
at home, I called my mother

48:31.996 --> 48:34.433
and she came to pick up me.

48:34.476 --> 48:37.175
We went to the police station,

48:37.218 --> 48:41.527
but at that time
we don't have a law
against domestic violence.

48:41.570 --> 48:47.794
And nothing happened.
He never went to the court.
Nothing happened.

49:00.981 --> 49:03.984
We didn't have
any specific law

49:04.028 --> 49:08.206
that protect women
in a violent situation.

49:08.249 --> 49:12.340
It was very difficult,
because most of the perpetrators

49:12.384 --> 49:15.735
of violence were not judged,
were not condemned.

49:44.155 --> 49:48.420
In 2006, when the
Maria da Penha Law
was approved...

49:49.725 --> 49:54.121
I saw that it was
a really important law.

49:54.165 --> 49:55.905
Because what happened with me

49:55.949 --> 49:58.125
will not happen
with other women,

49:58.169 --> 50:03.391
because now women will have
the tools to defend themselves.

50:03.435 --> 50:09.223
And this is
why I decided to,
as a citizen,

50:09.267 --> 50:15.621
contribute with my country,
promoting that law and
helping other women.

50:15.664 --> 50:18.276
And the tool that I had
to do it was graffiti.

50:42.300 --> 50:47.044
'Cause he beat me and I was
six months just at home.

50:47.087 --> 50:50.569
I never go out alone,
because we were afraid

50:50.612 --> 50:53.528
of the boy do something with me.

50:53.572 --> 50:58.055
And to be with that
group painting in the streets

50:58.098 --> 51:01.536
was a way to get free again,

51:01.580 --> 51:06.454
to have my life, to be happy,
to do something cool.

51:06.498 --> 51:09.327
And I started
doing the graffiti.

51:13.287 --> 51:17.683
A mark of a true leader
is someone who certainly
develops and innovates.

51:19.598 --> 51:23.732
They don't use those typical
models to create change.

51:23.776 --> 51:27.780
But I think for them,
who are also pioneers,

51:27.823 --> 51:29.347
and doing things
in different ways

51:29.390 --> 51:31.175
that some people
think are crazy,

51:31.218 --> 51:33.394
because they've never
been done before,

51:33.438 --> 51:35.309
and people don't think
they're gonna work.

51:35.353 --> 51:39.966
You have to have
a thick skin, and you have
to believe in your idea

51:40.009 --> 51:42.403
and it's ability to make change,

51:42.447 --> 51:44.753
because there's gonna
be a lot of people along
the way who don't.

51:48.322 --> 51:54.633
It is difficult for me to
see how Sister Fa's tour

51:54.676 --> 51:59.159
or caravan--
they call it here "caravane"--
can make change happen.

52:28.319 --> 52:31.365
Ending female genital
cutting is a long process.

52:31.409 --> 52:35.282
In most communities,
it has taken up to three
or four years

52:35.326 --> 52:38.285
to make that
decision to abandon.

52:38.329 --> 52:40.374
We need to give
that time to people.

52:40.418 --> 52:42.202
You just don't change overnight.

52:42.246 --> 52:46.163
You can't change such a deeply
entrenched practice overnight

52:46.206 --> 52:48.165
or in one day
or in two weeks.

52:58.479 --> 53:02.309
Many organizations
focus on youth

53:02.353 --> 53:05.312
and the idea being,

53:05.356 --> 53:07.923
"Perhaps this is
quite a Western idea

53:07.967 --> 53:12.841
that youth will be empowered
and that they can then
teach their parents,

53:12.885 --> 53:14.974
change the social norms."

53:15.017 --> 53:20.240
In non-Western societies,
elders teach younger people.

53:20.284 --> 53:23.156
Younger people are not
supposed to teach elders.

53:23.200 --> 53:25.811
Maybe some people in the
West wouldn't like that,

53:25.854 --> 53:27.856
but that's the way
the society is structured.

53:39.172 --> 53:41.870
This is not always an easy
thing that she's doing,

53:41.914 --> 53:43.568
even if she's Senegalese.

53:43.611 --> 53:46.832
She may not be of the same
ethnic group as the others

53:46.875 --> 53:50.270
and therefore all
they see is someone
coming in from the outside.

54:05.981 --> 54:09.811
For change to come about,
it has to be through dialogue

54:09.855 --> 54:13.511
with the people influence
the decision makers

54:13.554 --> 54:16.165
and that they come
to their own conclusion.

54:16.209 --> 54:18.472
And it's not
because a rap singer

54:18.516 --> 54:22.607
or because children were
given some new information
about their rights

54:22.650 --> 54:26.306
on one day or another that
change is going to come about.

54:27.829 --> 54:31.442
Have you ever had anyone
criticize your work?

54:52.506 --> 54:57.206
Un, deux, un, deux,
trios. We go!

55:15.312 --> 55:18.532
Sister Fa is animated
with this incredible desire

55:18.576 --> 55:20.882
to want to reach everyone.

55:20.926 --> 55:25.713
It's beautiful, I think,
that she really cares
so deeply about this.

55:25.757 --> 55:30.065
And has really contributed
to making that dialogue happen

55:30.109 --> 55:31.589
on an international level.

55:31.632 --> 55:34.287
She's involved in all
the international meetings

55:34.331 --> 55:36.376
held around female
genital cutting.

55:36.420 --> 55:39.379
She is a voice that speaks out
about it and makes people aware.

56:00.400 --> 56:03.795
I don't think that
there's a silver bullet.

56:03.838 --> 56:08.626
I think opportunities
will present themselves
where in some cases,

56:08.669 --> 56:15.067
an outsider from
a community can be believable
and can be embraced.

56:17.156 --> 56:20.159
We just have to
be street smart

56:20.202 --> 56:23.902
and look at where
there's an opportunity
to bring about change

56:23.945 --> 56:26.731
and what would work best
in a particular situation.

56:30.169 --> 56:32.519
This year we started
a jewelry training program

56:32.563 --> 56:34.956
within the non-profit,
which was new,

56:35.000 --> 56:37.524
and we were experimenting
to see how it would do.

56:37.568 --> 56:39.613
So the women went through
and they gained a lot of skills,

56:39.657 --> 56:43.791
and then three of them
were offered the opportunity
to start their own co-op.

56:43.835 --> 56:46.533
Judith, when's the last time
you saw these women?

56:50.668 --> 56:53.801
I'm excited to see it,
'cause I haven't seen
them since graduation.

56:58.371 --> 57:00.939
- It's so nice here.
- Thank you.

57:00.982 --> 57:02.984
So this
is your workshop now?

57:04.856 --> 57:08.816
No, you should keep
it like this forever.
It's so beautiful.

57:08.860 --> 57:11.297
They're making jewelry for a buyer in the US.

57:11.340 --> 57:14.431
And then hopefully
Judith & James can
give them some things

57:14.474 --> 57:18.217
and we can connect them
to other little markets
and small companies.

57:18.260 --> 57:20.349
But they're happy,
they're hopeful,

57:20.393 --> 57:24.615
and they're loving
the self-employment they're
experiencing right now.

57:49.901 --> 57:51.990
Viable economic opportunities

57:52.033 --> 57:56.516
are an important route
to a better life.

57:56.560 --> 58:01.042
It might be possible to have
a very localized market
in the neighborhood.

58:01.086 --> 58:03.784
But if you're a poor woman
in a poor neighborhood,

58:03.828 --> 58:06.961
by definition the market
is gonna be quite limited.

58:07.005 --> 58:09.747
And so having access
to export markets

58:09.790 --> 58:12.358
makes the possibilities
much, much larger.

58:14.491 --> 58:16.493
What are your hopes for
the future of this business?

58:35.424 --> 58:38.123
I do think, as an outsider,
you can make a difference

58:38.166 --> 58:40.691
if you are the link
to the resources.

58:40.734 --> 58:42.606
I come back
to the US for resource,

58:42.649 --> 58:45.696
because the boutiques here,
the department stores,

58:45.739 --> 58:47.611
the fundraisers
for the non-profit.

58:47.654 --> 58:51.310
I can always print on a silk
or on a linen or anything.

58:51.353 --> 58:54.748
So I come for the resource to
connect it to the need in Kenya.

58:56.010 --> 58:57.969
- Hi!
- Hi!

58:58.012 --> 59:00.319
We are at Tulip's Boutique,

59:00.362 --> 59:02.539
and we're here to speak
with Emily, the owner,

59:02.582 --> 59:05.150
and check on the clothes
and see how things are going
and what she needs.

59:05.193 --> 59:09.676
How have these been doing?
Like the darker prints, are you
ready for the emerald?

59:09.720 --> 59:12.331
Judith & James
and the foundation,

59:12.374 --> 59:14.812
the story behind it--
people wanna give to that.

59:14.855 --> 59:16.204
They love the product first,

59:16.248 --> 59:18.511
but they're also gonna love
the story behind it.

59:18.555 --> 59:20.774
- Yeah.
- What are you working on for fall?

59:20.818 --> 59:23.821
We're doing some new products,
embroidering, beading,

59:23.864 --> 59:25.779
- and some new techniques.
- Great, awesome.

59:25.823 --> 59:28.826
I want to employ
as many women as I can.

59:28.869 --> 59:31.176
I just have to wait
till I can afford it,

59:31.219 --> 59:34.396
because a commitment
to pay their salaries every
month is not a joke.

59:34.440 --> 59:38.270
And I would never want to
commit to them and then not
be able to follow through.

59:38.313 --> 59:40.098
So when I'm there
I'm fully focused on them,

59:40.141 --> 59:41.708
and when I'm here
I'm fully focused

59:41.752 --> 59:43.841
on the people around me
who can help this business.

59:45.756 --> 59:47.888
People ask her all the time,

59:47.932 --> 59:51.370
"Anna, why are you going all
the way across the world?

59:51.413 --> 59:53.633
You could help the poor
in our own backyard."

59:53.677 --> 59:58.072
She saw the need of millions
of women and widows

59:58.116 --> 1:00:01.902
without a voice in a place
where they don't have

1:00:01.946 --> 1:00:05.210
the resources that
people in America have.

1:00:05.253 --> 1:00:09.649
And you see as you go
and you work and you live
among these women,

1:00:09.693 --> 1:00:12.478
they want to make it,
they want to survive.

1:00:12.521 --> 1:00:17.309
It's what propels Anna to be
a part of making a difference.

1:00:39.679 --> 1:00:43.509
The first time I went
to see Sohini's work,

1:00:43.552 --> 1:00:45.990
I think I'll never
forget that trip.

1:00:46.033 --> 1:00:48.557
It was my first
time to Calcutta.

1:00:48.601 --> 1:00:53.519
As we went along
we started picking up girls
along the way at each stop,

1:00:53.562 --> 1:00:56.217
dance teachers
and dance instructors.

1:00:56.261 --> 1:01:02.223
And we then arrived
at the shelter where she
was teaching that day.

1:01:02.267 --> 1:01:06.619
And when we got there,
there was a conversation,
and then she turned around

1:01:06.663 --> 1:01:10.623
and she said, "It's gonna be
a very difficult day here,"
and I said, "Well, why?"

1:01:10.667 --> 1:01:14.279
And she said, because last
night one of the girls who was

1:01:14.322 --> 1:01:18.936
part of our class actually
died of HIV/AIDS.

1:01:18.979 --> 1:01:22.940
And the other girls who know
that they are HIV positive

1:01:22.983 --> 1:01:26.334
are very afraid of when
their last day will be.

1:02:57.295 --> 1:03:01.647
Initially, I was thinking maybe
I am the responsible,

1:03:01.690 --> 1:03:05.346
maybe the entire process
doesn't work properly.

1:03:05.390 --> 1:03:08.262
But it's part of
the entire process.

1:03:08.306 --> 1:03:13.224
The process has the success,
the process has the risk,
and it has a challenge.

1:03:13.267 --> 1:03:19.839
Not only me but
in the practitioners also,
today, it create an impact.

1:03:19.883 --> 1:03:24.061
It's not something we hide,
but we share it.

1:03:25.018 --> 1:03:27.412
Do you guys usually come
here after a long day?

1:03:27.455 --> 1:03:33.679
Yeah, we come here,
it's a special shop
which women run.

1:03:33.722 --> 1:03:38.249
And I think Jhulan and
Sangeeta said about the session.

1:03:38.292 --> 1:03:41.687
Mostly Jhulan and Sangeeta
come for the session

1:03:41.730 --> 1:03:45.299
and I supervise
the entire thing,
and I come in between.

1:04:45.577 --> 1:04:47.622
If you just come close
to most of the activists,

1:04:47.666 --> 1:04:49.798
we try to find solutions
for the world,

1:04:49.842 --> 1:04:51.757
and we don't have solutions
for our own life.

1:04:52.976 --> 1:04:55.239
Maybe if they just
don't talk about it,

1:04:55.282 --> 1:04:57.371
but if they tell you their life,

1:04:57.415 --> 1:04:59.896
they have, most of the time,
miserable private lives.

1:05:01.462 --> 1:05:04.378
My personal life has
definitely suffered.

1:05:04.422 --> 1:05:07.077
And I have just
realized it this year,

1:05:07.120 --> 1:05:08.556
when I started
taking weekends.

1:05:25.008 --> 1:05:27.184
This months--
actually May was one

1:05:27.227 --> 1:05:30.448
of the most horrible months
because I was in Maputo,

1:05:30.491 --> 1:05:35.061
then Malta, London, Paris,
then I'm going after tomorrow
to Africa for two weeks.

1:05:35.105 --> 1:05:37.934
I think it's difficult,
because I'm always moving.

1:05:37.977 --> 1:05:40.937
I'm not settled yet
in one place or another.

1:05:40.980 --> 1:05:44.984
I could spend my time missing
something that's in America
when I'm in Kenya.

1:05:45.028 --> 1:05:46.986
But I just decided not to,
and I have things

1:05:47.030 --> 1:05:49.946
that I look forward
to going to in each place.

1:05:51.077 --> 1:05:52.861
Do you ever get
sick of all the travel,

1:05:52.905 --> 1:05:54.820
all the packing
and unpacking?

1:05:54.863 --> 1:05:57.562
Of course, the whole May,

1:05:57.605 --> 1:06:02.349
I can say I did not land
more ten days on Earth.

1:06:02.393 --> 1:06:04.308
It was all the time in the air.

1:06:07.137 --> 1:06:12.707
The only thing sometimes
that I'm thinking is, "What
am I doing with my life?

1:06:12.751 --> 1:06:14.405
I'm not going out.
I'm doing nothing.

1:06:14.448 --> 1:06:16.537
I'm all the time
at home writing project,

1:06:16.581 --> 1:06:20.498
working, traveling, business.
I'm working like a machine."

1:06:20.541 --> 1:06:24.284
I don't know, I don't mean
that I'm not concerned
about what I'm doing,

1:06:24.328 --> 1:06:28.985
but some people will put
their personal things in front
and the work in the back.

1:06:29.028 --> 1:06:31.465
Actually, this is not
what I can balance.

1:06:34.686 --> 1:06:36.557
Why have you been
separated for two years?

1:06:36.601 --> 1:06:40.997
Yeah, first of all,
there was too many things
going on with my work.

1:06:41.040 --> 1:06:44.261
I was not around all the time.

1:06:44.304 --> 1:06:46.393
Then yeah,
things like this happen.

1:06:46.437 --> 1:06:50.484
When young people see
their interest doesn't lie
in the same direction.

1:06:50.528 --> 1:06:54.097
Because marriage is not only
to be together to smile.

1:06:54.140 --> 1:06:59.232
There is lots of things going on
about your work, how
you're handling life.

1:06:59.276 --> 1:07:02.540
We did not have, maybe, not
enough experience to know

1:07:02.583 --> 1:07:04.803
that we should not
mix our work together

1:07:04.846 --> 1:07:07.719
with our personal life,
and maybe this is one
of the mistake.

1:07:07.762 --> 1:07:09.503
But yes, it's thing
that happen.

1:07:09.547 --> 1:07:13.203
Then divorce
and separation happen.

1:07:13.246 --> 1:07:15.074
Yes, this must go.

1:07:20.775 --> 1:07:22.864
I was raised to marry.

1:07:22.908 --> 1:07:27.956
The most important thing
in the life of a woman...

1:07:29.132 --> 1:07:32.483
was to get married
and have the babies.

1:07:34.006 --> 1:07:38.054
I decided at the age of
18 I will not get married.

1:07:38.097 --> 1:07:42.188
So that is something I argued
with my family and other things,

1:07:42.232 --> 1:07:43.755
and I decided on that.

1:07:45.148 --> 1:07:48.020
So to lead a free,
independent life.

1:07:48.064 --> 1:07:49.804
And I enjoy that.

1:07:51.806 --> 1:07:54.592
Well, I tried.
I mean, I was dating someone
before I went to Kenya,

1:07:54.635 --> 1:07:57.203
and then met
someone in Kenya
that I had to leave.

1:07:57.247 --> 1:07:59.423
So, it just never
really works, right now.

1:07:59.466 --> 1:08:02.774
But I'm okay with that,
because I understand
that, as the founder,

1:08:02.817 --> 1:08:05.907
you have to do
everything at first.
And as a start up company,

1:08:05.951 --> 1:08:09.128
you have to just put in
all your soul, your time,

1:08:09.172 --> 1:08:11.739
and your energy to
get it off the ground.

1:08:11.783 --> 1:08:13.524
And of course, as a mom,

1:08:13.567 --> 1:08:17.354
sometime I feel like I need
my daughter close to me.

1:08:17.397 --> 1:08:20.226
I think she's pushing me
more and more.

1:08:20.270 --> 1:08:24.926
The fact to save one
is already very good,
and I've saved Mariama.

1:08:24.970 --> 1:08:26.102
She won't be cut.

1:08:28.539 --> 1:08:31.542
For me sure...
to live in a family,

1:08:31.585 --> 1:08:35.067
to take care of your family
is one of the most important
things in life.

1:08:35.111 --> 1:08:39.637
But I think also that to
save life might be also
something very important.

1:08:43.728 --> 1:08:47.471
Every year, two millions
of girl will be victim
of female genital cutting.

1:08:47.514 --> 1:08:50.430
For me, I'm not waiting.
I've never wait anyway
in my life.

1:08:50.474 --> 1:08:52.345
Yeah.

1:09:18.980 --> 1:09:22.245
For me, it's very easy
just to paint canvas,

1:09:22.288 --> 1:09:25.030
paint the wall and be
a famous artist.

1:09:25.073 --> 1:09:30.949
When I came
home and put my head
on the pillow to sleep...

1:09:32.124 --> 1:09:35.562
I imagined all the women
that suffering.

1:09:35.606 --> 1:09:39.566
How can you be
a famous, rich artist

1:09:39.610 --> 1:09:43.570
and ignore everything
that's happening outside?

1:09:43.614 --> 1:09:48.575
So I decided to use graffiti
and the respect that I have

1:09:48.619 --> 1:09:51.622
in doing grafitti to talk
about something important.

1:10:02.502 --> 1:10:06.680
Now if I come to a community or
to a school saying that I want

1:10:06.724 --> 1:10:12.251
to talk about domestic violence,
people will not come,
people don't care.

1:10:12.295 --> 1:10:16.124
When you come and say that you
will have a graffiti workshop,

1:10:16.168 --> 1:10:17.169
everybody wants to come.

1:11:06.262 --> 1:11:10.353
Violence against women is
considered by many men,

1:11:10.396 --> 1:11:14.270
and also by some
women, as "natural."

1:11:14.313 --> 1:11:18.448
Once a woman said to me,
"My mom suffered violence,

1:11:18.491 --> 1:11:21.973
my grandmom suffered violence,
my aunt suffered violence,

1:11:22.016 --> 1:11:25.542
so violence is part
of being married."

1:12:32.652 --> 1:12:34.524
7 out of 10 women in the world

1:12:34.567 --> 1:12:38.615
experience violence
in their lifetime.

1:12:38.658 --> 1:12:42.880
It's battering,
psychological torture,

1:12:42.923 --> 1:12:46.362
it is being raped.

1:12:46.405 --> 1:12:49.713
But I also wanted to refer
to structural violence
that does not allow

1:12:49.756 --> 1:12:54.718
women to actually be part of
the public sector in employment.

1:12:57.547 --> 1:13:04.858
My first impression
of Judith was that she was
very sad and struggling.

1:13:04.902 --> 1:13:08.079
I just remember being
in this small dirty room
in his house,

1:13:08.122 --> 1:13:10.342
she wouldn't lift
her eyes off the floor,

1:13:10.386 --> 1:13:12.257
and her shoes had holes in them.

1:13:12.300 --> 1:13:16.217
And she just didn't have
any light in her eyes
or any courage

1:13:16.261 --> 1:13:19.873
or happiness.
It seemed like she was
just so discouraged.

1:14:22.327 --> 1:14:24.503
I know that she's had
a very difficult past

1:14:24.547 --> 1:14:27.027
and has had desperation
in her past.

1:14:27.071 --> 1:14:30.683
But she's a success
story in herself.

1:14:30.727 --> 1:14:34.644
So for her to be able
to educate the eight children
she's taken care of--

1:14:34.687 --> 1:14:37.516
she only birthed three,
and the other ones are
from her brothers

1:14:37.560 --> 1:14:39.518
or sisters who have
died of AIDS.

1:14:39.562 --> 1:14:44.392
But for her to be
able to educate them and
to feed them, of course,

1:14:44.436 --> 1:14:46.612
pay the rent is
really a big deal.

1:14:48.353 --> 1:14:51.748
I want her to have excess,
not just the bare minimum.

1:14:51.791 --> 1:14:54.054
I want her to be able to
do what she wants in life.

1:14:55.621 --> 1:14:58.058
She's definitely one
of my best friends.

1:15:01.148 --> 1:15:02.498
What does she like?

1:15:02.541 --> 1:15:04.587
When I lived there
for six months

1:15:04.630 --> 1:15:07.241
as a 20-year-old,
I was with my family
for six months.

1:15:07.285 --> 1:15:09.853
And then they all left,
and I stayed by myself
for six months.

1:15:09.896 --> 1:15:14.684
And Judith and the other women,
they were like my shelter
and my refuge.

1:15:14.727 --> 1:15:16.512
They were my family.

1:15:34.138 --> 1:15:36.836
Emotionally they do treat me

1:15:36.880 --> 1:15:39.491
kind of like a daughter.
There is that element,
but with Judith,

1:15:39.535 --> 1:15:42.233
I normally think
of her more of as like
a partner or a sister.

1:15:44.627 --> 1:15:47.238
Yeah, I love them a lot.

1:16:05.735 --> 1:16:08.128
When I arrived there,
there was lots of little girls.

1:16:08.172 --> 1:16:12.089
I think was minimum
50 little girls, minimum.

1:16:15.614 --> 1:16:17.964
And the day
after in the morning,
they were taking us

1:16:18.008 --> 1:16:21.315
one after one behind
when they was cutting us.

1:16:21.359 --> 1:16:25.755
You just hear the scream
and you was terrified

1:16:25.798 --> 1:16:27.452
and you know you are
going through that thing

1:16:27.495 --> 1:16:30.020
behind without knowing
what's going on.

1:16:33.719 --> 1:16:36.679
I still remember
the blood on my feet,

1:16:36.722 --> 1:16:38.855
I still remember the face
of a woman,

1:16:38.898 --> 1:16:41.640
very strong woman,
who was like in front of me

1:16:41.684 --> 1:16:44.991
talking to me like this,
and my mum behind.

1:16:45.035 --> 1:16:50.344
I still remember that
the very powerful woman
was taking my hands

1:16:50.388 --> 1:16:54.784
and someone else
was also holding my legs
that I should not move.

1:16:54.827 --> 1:16:57.177
But I don't remember
how old I was.

1:16:58.701 --> 1:17:02.705
Probably between four,
five, and six years old.

1:17:05.577 --> 1:17:08.536
We did not know nothing
about what will happen to us.

1:17:13.106 --> 1:17:16.893
For me, I was having
a sentiment like I have
done something wrong,

1:17:16.936 --> 1:17:19.286
that I was fixing a punishment

1:17:19.330 --> 1:17:22.028
without remembering
anything wrong I have done.

1:17:27.033 --> 1:17:30.167
I did not realize that I am
not a complete woman,

1:17:30.210 --> 1:17:32.691
When I start
at school learning

1:17:32.735 --> 1:17:36.086
how the genital part of
the woman should look like,

1:17:36.129 --> 1:17:38.566
then I realize that something
is missing in my body.

1:17:38.610 --> 1:17:42.266
No one told me,
I discovered by my own.

1:17:42.309 --> 1:17:45.095
Then I started asking
myself a lot of questions,

1:17:45.138 --> 1:17:48.402
and started discovering there
is something going wrong.

1:18:16.430 --> 1:18:18.868
Art plays all the time
a big role.

1:18:18.911 --> 1:18:22.001
If we take
the example of singing,

1:18:22.045 --> 1:18:23.916
we know that the voice is one

1:18:23.960 --> 1:18:28.312
of the most important
instrument for a musician.

1:18:28.355 --> 1:18:31.707
Inside our text,
we can put a some
very strong message

1:18:31.750 --> 1:18:33.752
that people can listen
to without getting hurt.

1:18:49.289 --> 1:18:51.944
Yeah, this is my
father and mother.

1:18:51.988 --> 1:18:56.732
And I think this is their
marriage photograph.

1:18:56.775 --> 1:18:59.299
I grew up very independently

1:18:59.343 --> 1:19:05.958
because my mother was sick
from my early childhood.

1:19:06.002 --> 1:19:08.874
And then she detected cancer.

1:19:08.918 --> 1:19:13.792
Then for three was
very like suffering,
and then she died.

1:19:13.836 --> 1:19:17.535
At that time,
it created a big impact.

1:19:20.277 --> 1:19:21.800
My entire life changed.

1:19:23.802 --> 1:19:28.241
Whatever care and
support my mother does,

1:19:28.285 --> 1:19:30.896
like cooking and
the home things,

1:19:30.940 --> 1:19:34.334
I had to take all
the responsibility
for my mother.

1:19:35.596 --> 1:19:38.599
It was a very,
very struggling period.

1:20:20.119 --> 1:20:23.079
Everybody has struggle
in different phases

1:20:23.122 --> 1:20:25.255
and struggle is
part of the life.

1:20:25.298 --> 1:20:29.737
I think my, that three years
of adolescent period,

1:20:29.781 --> 1:20:33.045
gave me that insight
to be prepared for the life.

1:20:38.921 --> 1:20:41.837
I am deeply connected with them.

1:20:50.410 --> 1:20:53.457
If you look around the world at
all the issues that women face,

1:20:53.500 --> 1:20:57.940
The one thing that unites us,
is there is not a single
culture, community,

1:20:57.983 --> 1:21:02.988
religion that can say
violence against women,
domestic violence,

1:21:03.032 --> 1:21:06.905
culturally harmful practices,
trafficking, does not exist.

1:21:06.949 --> 1:21:08.298
It exists everywhere.

1:21:08.341 --> 1:21:10.735
It is that thing
that all of us face.

1:21:10.778 --> 1:21:12.824
And really, the heart of it,

1:21:12.868 --> 1:21:16.306
is the way in which we value
women in our cultures.

1:21:16.349 --> 1:21:21.180
And if culture and values
is the barrier, couldn't we also

1:21:21.224 --> 1:21:24.140
look at how to use culture

1:21:24.183 --> 1:21:27.970
to combat some of the negative
influences of culture?

1:21:37.980 --> 1:21:43.072
100 graffiti artists
are coming and

1:21:43.115 --> 1:21:46.684
they are going to paint mixing
the theme of the World Cup

1:21:46.727 --> 1:21:49.339
and the campaign
against domestic violence.

1:22:37.691 --> 1:22:39.606
We're in New York
Fashion Week.

1:22:39.650 --> 1:22:43.219
Yeah, we're about to show
the Judith & James Fall/Winter
2014 collection.

1:22:46.526 --> 1:22:48.441
Like I'm still so new to this,

1:22:48.485 --> 1:22:50.748
so I'm learning
as much as I can.

1:22:50.791 --> 1:22:54.273
But it's a good opportunity for
Judith & James to get press

1:22:54.317 --> 1:22:57.755
and media and to spread
the brand and the story.

1:23:00.236 --> 1:23:03.587
Music start where
the language stop.

1:23:03.630 --> 1:23:08.984
For me, during the
concert it's what we call
the mass communication.

1:23:10.072 --> 1:23:13.640
Every year, two millions
of girl will be victim of
female genital cutting.

1:23:13.684 --> 1:23:16.165
I think that I will feel very
proud if one day in Senegal

1:23:16.208 --> 1:23:18.036
they say it doesn't
exist anymore.

1:23:22.345 --> 1:23:25.043
Graffiti, it's a lifestyle.

1:23:25.087 --> 1:23:26.523
It's a culture.

1:23:26.566 --> 1:23:31.571
And if we insert the program
against domestic violence,

1:23:31.615 --> 1:23:37.055
the talk about gender
inside this culture,

1:23:37.099 --> 1:23:40.537
we are changing
the way that people think.

1:23:45.977 --> 1:23:47.718
I mean, I'm not trying
to save the world.

1:23:47.761 --> 1:23:49.676
So many people say they are.

1:23:49.720 --> 1:23:53.593
I think it's a great idea,
but it's not possible
to get to everyone.

1:23:53.637 --> 1:23:56.292
But I'm just happy
to get to as many as I can.

1:23:56.335 --> 1:23:58.685
And even if it's one
and I die, that's fine.

1:23:58.729 --> 1:24:01.645
I just want to get as many
as I can on their feet.

1:24:05.779 --> 1:24:09.696
I feel all women
are creative in this world.

1:24:09.740 --> 1:24:15.137
But sometimes,
because of our
society's structure--

1:24:15.180 --> 1:24:19.793
because of the
patriarchal structures,
because of the gender structure,

1:24:19.837 --> 1:24:23.406
they stop themselves
to take action.

1:24:25.451 --> 1:24:29.194
But if that comes when women
come with that action,

1:24:29.238 --> 1:24:34.895
I think that will bring great
changes in the society.

1:24:34.939 --> 1:24:38.334
So I always
encourage young people,
young women, do.

1:24:38.377 --> 1:24:41.728
Do something!
If you have idea,
be bold with that.

1:24:43.817 --> 1:24:49.345
But I have trust, belief,
with all women.

1:24:49.388 --> 1:24:51.347
Women are creative.
