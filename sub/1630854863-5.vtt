WEBVTT

00:15.086 --> 00:18.020
Burn your clothes, everything.
Shoes, socks, undies, the lot.

00:18.020 --> 00:19.980
I reckon you had dinner
somewhere else. What do you think?

00:19.980 --> 00:20.886
Yeah, yeah.

00:20.886 --> 00:21.873
You and the missus?

00:22.579 --> 00:23.683
And the missus,
that's right.

00:23.683 --> 00:25.276
You ever had sex with this?

00:25.276 --> 00:27.058
Well, you've got to
try it once.

00:27.058 --> 00:28.155
You must be Doyle.

00:28.155 --> 00:30.681
Luke O'Neill, you'll be
partnering up on this one.

00:31.336 --> 00:33.303
Police! Drop the weapon,
drop it.

00:33.303 --> 00:34.994
We're in a
months long operation,

00:34.994 --> 00:38.163
and you have just
royally fucked us.

00:38.256 --> 00:41.398
That's new. A Vietnamese dealer
operating here.

00:41.557 --> 00:44.472
You're here to tell me to
stay away from Kings Cross,

00:44.472 --> 00:45.443
or...

00:45.443 --> 00:46.682
It's not really a choice.

00:51.439 --> 00:52.603
What the fuck did they get?

00:55.138 --> 00:56.365
The whole thing corrupt.

00:56.459 --> 00:58.650
The entire New South Wales
police force?

00:58.650 --> 00:59.977
I have all their names,

00:59.977 --> 01:01.847
80 cops, they take my money.

01:02.197 --> 01:03.365
Hey Nasa!

01:20.608 --> 01:23.094
Nasa Kalouri,
Kings Cross nightclub owner

01:23.094 --> 01:25.462
and alleged underworld
figure, was shot dead

01:25.462 --> 01:28.530
outside his suburban Sydney
home several days ago.

01:28.627 --> 01:31.427
His wife, Arianna Kalouri,
who was inside

01:31.427 --> 01:32.519
at the time of the shooting,

01:32.519 --> 01:34.895
found Mr. Kalouri
bleeding and unconscious

01:34.895 --> 01:37.936
in their driveway after
hearing several gunshots.

01:38.130 --> 01:41.300
Paramedics pronounced
Mr. Kalouri dead at the scene.

01:41.924 --> 01:45.570
Mr. Kalouri's death comes soon
after his explosive TV interview,

01:45.570 --> 01:47.689
where he threatened
to reveal all he knew

01:47.689 --> 01:49.919
- about endemic corruption...
- I should never have let this happen.

01:50.600 --> 01:52.257
He should never have
opened his mouth.

01:52.257 --> 01:54.363
He wouldn't have
followed through, John.

01:58.778 --> 02:00.381
I want to know who.

02:00.704 --> 02:01.986
This is not the time.

02:02.864 --> 02:04.714
We need to keep
our heads down.

02:04.811 --> 02:06.094
Get back to work.

02:13.655 --> 02:15.130
You take over as shot caller.

02:16.435 --> 02:17.982
I can't do it, but you can.

02:18.711 --> 02:20.573
Ten times better
than any of us.

02:21.783 --> 02:24.407
Then we build a team of our
own, place them in venues.

02:24.407 --> 02:25.977
I've already got
things in motion.

02:26.160 --> 02:28.145
And yeah, we'll still have
to kick up for collections.

02:28.145 --> 02:30.230
But for now we can
take Nasa's share.

02:30.230 --> 02:31.570
Look after Arianna.

02:33.538 --> 02:36.406
You got every little step
all figured out.

02:37.832 --> 02:39.605
Man's body is still warm, John.

02:41.493 --> 02:42.695
It's business, Sam.

02:45.238 --> 02:47.338
You can't let them forget
who runs the street.

02:51.777 --> 02:53.206
Don't worry, they won't.

04:09.563 --> 04:11.133
Talk about overkill.

04:11.715 --> 04:14.149
Not exactly
a professional job.

04:14.604 --> 04:16.401
Or that's what
someone wants us to think.

04:16.401 --> 04:18.987
Well, whoever knocked
him did us a favour.

04:18.987 --> 04:21.826
All the publicity means the
pollies in Macquarie Street

04:21.826 --> 04:23.632
won't be able to sit on
their hands much longer.

04:24.152 --> 04:25.228
I say we've got
a couple of weeks

04:25.228 --> 04:26.742
before we have to
declare ourselves.

04:26.742 --> 04:29.670
So, go now, go hard, people.

04:29.790 --> 04:31.435
None of us is known
in this town.

04:31.435 --> 04:33.840
So with a bit of luck
and a fair wind,

04:35.358 --> 04:36.924
this lot won't see us coming.

04:37.071 --> 04:38.801
We're not going
to be very popular,

04:39.054 --> 04:41.393
going after one of the
state's most decorated cops.

04:41.393 --> 04:43.684
Well, it's not too late to
go home to Perth, Lukie.

04:43.684 --> 04:45.088
- I'm just saying.
- I don't give a big

04:45.088 --> 04:46.410
rat's arse who they are.

04:46.410 --> 04:48.467
If they're bent,
they're fair game.

04:49.240 --> 04:52.359
And don't forget their mates,
the ones who paid them off:

04:52.612 --> 04:55.665
the loan sharks,
the racketeers, club owners,

04:55.665 --> 04:59.120
standover men! Happy days.

05:08.074 --> 05:09.560
Come on!

05:11.647 --> 05:14.322
Let's go, let's go!
Come on!

05:17.102 --> 05:18.262
Get up! Let's go!

05:20.871 --> 05:22.328
Come on you dog!

05:22.328 --> 05:28.103
...he's
racing away, Myra Diva bolts in,

05:28.103 --> 05:32.967
Velocity Liberty second,
just ahead of two time...

05:49.839 --> 05:51.803
Born in Lebanon,
Nasa Kalouri

05:51.803 --> 05:54.794
took no time in establishing
himself in Kings Cross,

05:54.794 --> 05:57.645
soon after his arrival
in the late 1960s.

05:57.645 --> 06:01.598
In the wake of Mr. Kalouri's very
public threats to spill the beans,

06:01.598 --> 06:03.220
any one of his
erstwhile friends

06:03.220 --> 06:05.595
in Sydney's underworld
could be responsible

06:05.595 --> 06:07.290
for his untimely demise.

06:24.432 --> 06:26.435
Police have
so far refused to comment,

06:26.435 --> 06:28.728
but urge any witnesses
to come forward.

06:28.728 --> 06:31.539
When asked whether Mr. Kalouri's
death may lead to an escalation...

06:31.539 --> 06:32.799
Last of the old school.

06:33.165 --> 06:34.500
He's not that old.

06:35.220 --> 06:36.330
I quite liked him.

06:44.019 --> 06:45.310
You got any smokes?

06:54.712 --> 06:56.186
That dumb Lebo dickhead.

06:56.835 --> 06:58.127
What did he think
was going to happen?

06:58.385 --> 07:00.141
Going on the news
to rat out your mates.

07:02.202 --> 07:04.439
And now he's dead.

07:04.567 --> 07:06.025
I need help!

07:07.976 --> 07:11.608
- Settle down, love.
- Hookers! Can't take a joke.

07:12.578 --> 07:13.598
Okay.

07:14.511 --> 07:16.575
Bastard
just punched me.

07:16.672 --> 07:18.442
Do I fucking know you?

07:19.305 --> 07:21.318
I didn't do anything.

07:22.693 --> 07:24.184
You have a good night, mate.

07:30.351 --> 07:31.560
Stop!

07:32.833 --> 07:34.661
Sam, what are you doing?

07:35.871 --> 07:37.245
Sam, stop!

07:38.119 --> 07:39.560
Knock it off, Sam.

07:43.538 --> 07:45.420
Sam! What are you doing?

07:49.204 --> 07:51.411
Sam, what are you doing, stop!

07:52.527 --> 07:53.668
Sam!

07:55.988 --> 07:57.156
Stop!

07:58.135 --> 08:00.153
He's a cop, you fucking idiot!

08:10.346 --> 08:11.563
How bad is he?

08:12.211 --> 08:15.354
Multiple broken ribs, fucking
ruptured spleen,

08:15.354 --> 08:18.036
- he's fucked.
- Jesus fuckin' Christ.

08:18.853 --> 08:20.810
Mate, that's some
serious compensation

08:20.810 --> 08:23.260
or that Sam Ibrahim
is fucking dead.

08:23.260 --> 08:24.851
He's fucking dead.

08:35.324 --> 08:36.449
John.

08:39.371 --> 08:40.459
He's not here.

08:40.939 --> 08:43.505
You need to rectify this
situation very quickly

08:43.505 --> 08:44.770
because there's quite
a few of our blokes

08:44.770 --> 08:46.296
would like a little
chat with Sam.

08:46.296 --> 08:48.841
There's no fuckin' way he's
getting away with this, mate.

08:48.841 --> 08:51.702
I've asked around. It seems like your cop
got exactly what was coming to him.

08:51.702 --> 08:53.257
That's irrelevant.

08:54.404 --> 08:57.628
This is what you need to
hand over to make this go away.

08:59.760 --> 09:00.813
Oh, go fuck yourself.

09:00.813 --> 09:01.760
Go fuck myself?

09:01.760 --> 09:03.106
- Yeah.
- Excuse me?

09:03.202 --> 09:04.925
Your mate can get compo
while he recovers.

09:04.925 --> 09:06.438
Who's going to
look after the girl?

09:06.699 --> 09:07.731
Don't give a fuck
about the girl.

09:07.731 --> 09:09.224
- Of course you don't.
- Oi, John.

09:10.085 --> 09:11.806
We're not fucking asking, mate.

09:11.806 --> 09:13.086
You understand?

09:16.226 --> 09:17.433
Look, why don't you
come back with something

09:17.433 --> 09:18.654
more reasonable,
and then we can talk.

09:18.654 --> 09:20.383
John, given the state he's in,

09:20.383 --> 09:22.287
this is very reasonable.

09:26.330 --> 09:27.578
Go on. Fuck off.

09:27.578 --> 09:28.878
Fucking
watch yourself, mate.

09:28.878 --> 09:29.878
Off you go.

09:40.828 --> 09:43.558
Nice night for it ladies.
How are we?

09:43.558 --> 09:45.346
- Good.
- Good to see you.

09:45.346 --> 09:46.820
Be safe out there, okay?

09:46.820 --> 09:48.919
We will.

09:51.359 --> 09:52.775
Love my job.

09:53.710 --> 09:55.001
Where's Sammy?

09:55.395 --> 09:56.666
He's busy.

10:02.808 --> 10:04.641
Yeah, nice driving,
dickhead!

10:22.078 --> 10:24.822
Oh, are you
fucking kidding me?

10:31.850 --> 10:34.670
Ugh, what
the fuck are they doing here?

10:37.234 --> 10:38.693
Royal Peak Elliot
running on,

10:38.693 --> 10:41.890
but under great pressure, and as I say,
this leader is a real mudlark,

10:41.890 --> 10:43.925
and Elliot's the
only danger to him,

10:43.925 --> 10:44.816
and then Our Approval...

10:44.816 --> 10:45.975
Let's go!
Let's go!

10:45.975 --> 10:47.675
All Nations,
a length and a half to Elliot,

10:47.675 --> 10:49.430
who's under the whip,
three lengths away,

10:49.430 --> 10:51.547
Our Approval and
Royal Peak, All Nations,

10:51.547 --> 10:52.831
- the boy had to come...
- Come on baby girl.

10:52.831 --> 10:54.606
Elliot's got up to a half
length from him...

10:54.606 --> 10:55.793
I said get up! Get up!

10:56.894 --> 10:58.278
Come on, baby!

10:58.386 --> 11:00.042
Fucking slug.

11:00.042 --> 11:01.809
Elliot drawing
away from All Nations,

11:01.809 --> 11:04.292
long after Royal Peak
and then come up...

11:04.292 --> 11:05.832
Fucking slug.

11:11.225 --> 11:12.438
Sam Ibrahim.

11:13.531 --> 11:14.391
Sam Ibrahim!

11:15.804 --> 11:18.550
- Jesus.
- Yeah, race seven, Lion's Share.

11:18.550 --> 11:19.498
What the fuck happen in here?

11:19.498 --> 11:20.792
Yeah, let's go six grand.

11:26.839 --> 11:27.567
How much?

11:27.567 --> 11:28.859
About six grand.

11:30.517 --> 11:31.689
Good timing.

11:34.072 --> 11:35.508
Have we got new security yet?

11:35.712 --> 11:37.794
Nah, it's just Mullet.

11:41.252 --> 11:42.512
Cheers.

12:22.756 --> 12:24.104
Hey, baby, how you doing?

12:25.981 --> 12:27.401
I just want to hear from you

12:27.401 --> 12:29.312
exactly how this
is going to work.

12:29.945 --> 12:32.876
Because you may have noticed
things are changing out there.

12:33.388 --> 12:34.845
Coke is bringing
the degenerates.

12:34.845 --> 12:37.501
We've got the Viets rapping on the gate.

12:37.501 --> 12:39.004
Stronger police presence.

12:39.004 --> 12:41.501
This is not the time
to be disorganised.

12:41.501 --> 12:43.228
Our businesses depend on it.

12:44.061 --> 12:46.558
Well, it's going to work the
same way as it did under Nasa,

12:47.180 --> 12:48.391
only better.

12:50.126 --> 12:51.566
So you're Nasa?

12:52.919 --> 12:54.045
I'm me.

12:55.878 --> 12:56.938
And Sam?

12:57.222 --> 12:58.308
Sam's with us.

12:58.792 --> 12:59.810
You sure?

12:59.810 --> 13:01.978
Because I haven't seen
his mug since the funeral.

13:01.978 --> 13:03.098
No, he's good.

13:03.877 --> 13:05.455
He'll run the streets,
handle collections

13:05.455 --> 13:06.848
while I get
the new guys in.

13:06.848 --> 13:08.764
We need time
to make this work.

13:09.139 --> 13:11.464
But you two, you don't need
to worry about a thing.

13:12.639 --> 13:14.250
I'll deal with Ezra, too.

13:15.076 --> 13:18.395
John, you want to be real
careful with people like Ezra.

13:18.926 --> 13:20.195
I know what I'm doing.

13:20.195 --> 13:21.354
So did Nasa.

13:23.049 --> 13:24.289
Problem at
the front door, Johnny.

13:26.193 --> 13:27.446
Everything will be fine.

13:28.066 --> 13:29.896
You just give me your support,

13:30.383 --> 13:31.903
I'll handle the rest.

13:34.153 --> 13:35.255
Thank you, Frank.

13:36.985 --> 13:38.085
PK.

13:40.956 --> 13:42.261
You boys enjoy your night.

13:42.985 --> 13:44.068
It's a good view.

13:48.744 --> 13:50.177
He's young.

13:50.177 --> 13:51.349
Naive.

13:51.619 --> 13:53.074
He's our best bet.

13:54.308 --> 13:56.224
Hey, if you're at capacity,

13:56.224 --> 13:57.630
then why'd you
let them bitches in?

13:58.276 --> 13:59.271
Ease up, mate.

13:59.271 --> 14:01.342
Look at the size
of this cunt.

14:01.342 --> 14:04.972
Hey, fellas, fellas.
Fellas, come over here.

14:05.112 --> 14:06.306
Come here.

14:06.306 --> 14:07.396
I just want to have
a little chat.

14:08.363 --> 14:11.129
Hey, listen,
do me a favour.

14:11.129 --> 14:12.103
Tonight's not really
your crowd.

14:12.103 --> 14:13.219
Do you mind coming
back another night?

14:13.219 --> 14:14.571
Maybe go to another venue?

14:16.009 --> 14:17.882
Are you fucking serious
cockhead?

14:18.352 --> 14:19.359
Calm down.

14:21.333 --> 14:22.832
Or else what?

14:42.859 --> 14:44.129
Watch out
for his gun!

14:53.287 --> 14:54.371
Dave.

14:56.617 --> 14:58.978
Reset, make sure there's
four on the door from now on.

14:58.978 --> 14:59.992
Yeah.

14:59.992 --> 15:01.201
It's like the wild west.

15:01.201 --> 15:02.484
What are you doing mate?

15:02.484 --> 15:03.934
- Johnny.
- Can't be getting into

15:03.934 --> 15:05.374
fights no more, right.

15:05.374 --> 15:06.400
You are one of us now.

15:06.400 --> 15:08.566
Yeah, no, I've got it, PK. Yep.

15:08.566 --> 15:09.990
This is not good
for business, mate.

15:09.990 --> 15:11.183
Thanks Skinny.

15:11.183 --> 15:12.503
What's up?

15:12.503 --> 15:15.031
Some Lebo's dealing blow
to the girls in the Stripperama.

15:16.188 --> 15:17.508
Fuck's sake.

15:19.169 --> 15:21.580
Best quality Mexican,
hundred percent pure.

15:21.580 --> 15:23.155
Only Waali Mansour
can get this.

15:23.155 --> 15:24.430
All right.

15:26.332 --> 15:27.853
If it was a hundred
percent pure,

15:27.853 --> 15:29.375
I think you'd be dead, baby.

15:29.375 --> 15:31.290
Relax darling.
It just feels that way, all right?

15:34.797 --> 15:35.743
And then you're reborn.

15:35.743 --> 15:36.678
Who's next?

15:36.678 --> 15:38.144
Ladies, get out.

15:40.628 --> 15:41.919
Come on, come on.

15:45.897 --> 15:47.187
Sam said,
gave me the go ahead.

15:47.187 --> 15:48.585
Sam Ibrahim,
said I was good here.

15:48.585 --> 15:50.440
- Piss off, Simone.
- Yep, I'm going.

15:54.402 --> 15:55.957
Split that amongst your girls.

15:57.960 --> 16:00.404
- Dave, get rid of this shit.
- Boom, got it.

16:01.626 --> 16:02.866
Why are you
letting this happen?

16:03.434 --> 16:04.821
Where the fuck
is your brother?

16:04.914 --> 16:07.251
If he was on deck, none of
this shit would be happening.

16:08.065 --> 16:09.292
It's not good enough, Steph.

16:09.292 --> 16:10.454
Sort it out.

16:17.018 --> 16:18.132
Can I help?

16:20.405 --> 16:21.631
Um...

16:22.161 --> 16:23.442
Ah, yeah.

17:05.080 --> 17:06.472
You do know, don't you?

17:08.717 --> 17:11.739
- Sure, yeah.
- Great.

17:12.552 --> 17:14.038
I'm not like the other girls.

17:14.548 --> 17:16.274
That's cool.

17:16.738 --> 17:17.924
I'm, I'm cool.

17:17.924 --> 17:19.712
Get more bang for
your buck anyway.

17:27.172 --> 17:28.925
If John ever finds out...

17:33.752 --> 17:35.358
He's not going to
hear from me, baby.

17:37.585 --> 17:38.622
Come here.

17:49.683 --> 17:51.742
All right,
well we're a bit early,

17:51.742 --> 17:52.989
so let's just head up
to the Beefsteak,

17:52.989 --> 17:54.461
and then we'll head
down after that.

17:57.931 --> 18:00.406
Ah, fuck, look out, here she comes.

18:00.406 --> 18:01.934
Charlie's Angels.

18:01.934 --> 18:04.121
Oh fuck, forgot to tell you.

18:04.211 --> 18:05.728
Spoke to a mate of mine, Jeff.

18:05.728 --> 18:08.253
He works in Canberra.
He knows Doyle.

18:08.253 --> 18:10.072
He reckons she's
fucking off tap.

18:10.072 --> 18:11.032
Bit of a maverick.

18:11.032 --> 18:12.005
Yeah right.

18:12.005 --> 18:14.009
Unmarried, never has been.

18:14.009 --> 18:15.815
Possibly a muff diver.

18:15.815 --> 18:19.332
Which is a bit of a shame, because
apparently she's a two pot screamer.

18:22.505 --> 18:23.408
Doyle.

18:23.408 --> 18:25.025
Fancy bumping into you here.

18:25.025 --> 18:26.419
Small world.

18:26.715 --> 18:27.639
Apparently.

18:27.639 --> 18:28.989
You staying around here?

18:29.209 --> 18:30.169
I am.

18:30.169 --> 18:31.804
I like it cheap and cheerful.

18:31.804 --> 18:33.374
There's plenty of
that around here.

18:33.374 --> 18:34.794
Listen, you still
owe us that drink,

18:34.794 --> 18:36.312
and we were going to go
and have a cheeky one

18:36.312 --> 18:37.613
before we go and
see an informant.

18:37.613 --> 18:38.680
You want to come with us?

18:39.232 --> 18:40.867
It's a bit early for me.

18:41.091 --> 18:43.498
Yeah, coffee would
be good though.

18:43.498 --> 18:45.082
Ahhh...

18:45.082 --> 18:46.375
Cosmo?

18:48.971 --> 18:50.028
So here we are.

18:50.028 --> 18:51.321
Scene of the crime.

18:52.696 --> 18:53.862
Thanks.

18:55.550 --> 18:56.850
Lucky shots weren't fired.

18:56.850 --> 18:59.329
It was a pretty heavy crew
you boys were mixing with.

18:59.925 --> 19:01.104
Well, that's the job.

19:01.975 --> 19:05.090
What exactly is your job, detective?

19:07.056 --> 19:08.354
It's keeping our
ears to the ground

19:08.354 --> 19:10.041
so we can constantly check
the temperature

19:10.041 --> 19:12.118
of the street and see what
these pricks are up to

19:12.118 --> 19:13.700
who would slip their own
mother's throats

19:13.700 --> 19:14.867
if there was a buck in it.

19:17.086 --> 19:18.839
And what's the temperature
like at the moment?

19:18.839 --> 19:19.888
Red hot.

19:20.823 --> 19:24.435
And look, ideally, we always
want to work our way to the top

19:24.435 --> 19:25.895
and then nail them
when we get there.

19:25.895 --> 19:28.212
But clearly with Nasa,
we failed.

19:28.298 --> 19:30.891
Which is a shame.
He was a, he was a good bloke.

19:30.891 --> 19:34.617
If you look past the extortion,
prostitution, and racketeering.

19:34.617 --> 19:36.794
Well, does homicide
have a suspect?

19:36.794 --> 19:39.873
Not that we're aware of.
But it's early days.

19:39.873 --> 19:41.697
Fuck, there's plenty
of competition

19:41.697 --> 19:44.136
who's going to come in
and try and fill that void.

19:45.895 --> 19:47.161
I'd follow the money.

19:47.557 --> 19:50.121
Try and think who's going to
benefit the most from Nasa's death.

19:52.628 --> 19:54.589
Sam Ibrahim would be my bet.

19:58.459 --> 20:00.145
All right, we're going to
go and meet this bloke.

20:00.722 --> 20:02.162
If you need anything else,
just let us know.

20:02.162 --> 20:04.698
And if anything comes to us
from homicide, we'll pass it on.

20:06.474 --> 20:08.300
- All right, see ya.
- See ya, mate.

20:18.938 --> 20:21.665
I don't believe
a fucking word he says.

20:21.665 --> 20:23.782
That's a prick of a
job when you think about it.

20:24.562 --> 20:25.792
Cosying up to crooks?

20:25.792 --> 20:28.087
But like someone's got to keep
their ear to the ground.

20:28.087 --> 20:29.434
He seems pretty good at it.

20:29.764 --> 20:31.417
Sounds like you're
defending him.

20:31.792 --> 20:33.072
Defending who?

20:33.727 --> 20:35.632
Detective Sergeant
Bryan Crellan.

20:35.783 --> 20:37.098
This one's got
the hots for him.

20:38.460 --> 20:40.717
John and Sam,
the Ibrahim boys.

20:41.127 --> 20:42.811
Crellan's pointing
the finger at Sam.

20:43.143 --> 20:47.133
But apparently Johnny went
from doorman out in Parramatta

20:47.133 --> 20:49.725
to owning three clubs in
the Cross in a heartbeat.

20:49.865 --> 20:52.242
Plus he's opening
another one tonight.

20:52.648 --> 20:53.735
Maybe he won lotto.

20:53.895 --> 20:56.436
Yeah, or maybe he just has
one hell of a work ethic.

20:56.436 --> 20:58.394
He was buddies with
Kalouri as well.

20:58.774 --> 21:00.733
Or enemies.
We, we don't know yet.

21:00.941 --> 21:02.346
So you think he killed him?

21:03.284 --> 21:04.326
Maybe.

21:04.543 --> 21:06.298
The point is, he's ambitious.

21:06.298 --> 21:07.558
He has a lot to lose.

21:07.558 --> 21:11.190
If we push the right
buttons, he might flip.

21:11.977 --> 21:14.660
Maybe bring the whole
deck of cards down for us.

21:21.547 --> 21:25.024
Hey, this must be
the place, huh?

21:25.280 --> 21:26.530
Howdy, brother.

21:26.910 --> 21:27.974
Is your boss home?

21:27.974 --> 21:29.572
He is not ready yet.

21:29.572 --> 21:30.829
Don't worry,
we'll find him.

21:31.860 --> 21:34.139
Nobody go inside
until I say so, okay?

21:34.306 --> 21:36.103
Come on, Paco,
don't be like that.

21:36.103 --> 21:38.355
Be reasonable, chief,
you're outnumbered.

21:38.355 --> 21:39.215
Outnumbered where?

21:39.215 --> 21:40.768
There's only three
of you here.

21:41.508 --> 21:44.345
- Fellas.
- Hey.

21:44.482 --> 21:45.557
I see you've met Sammy.

21:45.557 --> 21:46.324
Come on in.

21:46.324 --> 21:47.384
Nice to meet you, Sammy.

21:47.384 --> 21:48.601
You have a good one, eh?

21:49.199 --> 21:51.194
Hey, you doing
the tough guy thing, Levi.

21:52.212 --> 21:53.815
We worked the doors out west.

21:53.815 --> 21:55.375
- You'll like 'em.
- Are you sure?

21:56.384 --> 21:57.402
Fuck!

21:57.993 --> 21:59.685
All right fellas,
here's the deal.

22:00.345 --> 22:01.573
Things are changing.

22:02.169 --> 22:05.145
I need guys I know,
and I know I can trust.

22:05.145 --> 22:06.995
Hey, hey,
where's Sam and Anton?

22:06.995 --> 22:08.048
Don't worry about them.

22:08.578 --> 22:10.022
You're working with me now.

22:10.380 --> 22:11.892
I'm handling the street.

22:12.333 --> 22:13.514
It's good enough for me.

22:13.514 --> 22:14.660
Good.

22:15.407 --> 22:17.217
Nick, Levi.

22:17.784 --> 22:19.874
I just want you guys
doing what you do best.

22:19.960 --> 22:22.605
Moving between venues,
keeping the peace.

22:23.169 --> 22:26.487
Karate, we all know how
much you love Porky's.

22:27.354 --> 22:29.940
I was thinking it'd make
you permanent at the door.

22:30.525 --> 22:32.459
- Sound good?
- Mm-hm.

22:32.684 --> 22:34.006
Mr. Puck?

22:34.720 --> 22:36.028
Mr. Puck!

22:36.459 --> 22:38.553
You're just in charge of
side kicks to the head.

22:38.752 --> 22:40.239
Reckon you can do that?

22:40.239 --> 22:41.946
Aye!

22:42.044 --> 22:44.805
And we all know
that Dave can't fight.

22:44.805 --> 22:47.430
So um, JT, Tom,
and Sam and I

22:47.430 --> 22:49.374
will just look after
everything else.

22:51.419 --> 22:53.851
Guys, there is a massive
power shift happening.

22:54.748 --> 22:56.800
I need us to keep
this circle tight.

22:58.283 --> 23:01.435
It means you only talk openly
with the people in this room.

23:03.540 --> 23:05.956
And Anton and Sam,
if you see 'em.

23:07.303 --> 23:10.311
Now, tonight's the big opening.
So you know, look sharp.

23:10.673 --> 23:11.692
Let's make some money.

23:15.388 --> 23:17.406
♪ Checking if I had
Someone with me ♪

23:17.406 --> 23:19.228
♪ Everybody in the place
Wants to get with me ♪

23:19.228 --> 23:23.311
♪ I see you staring up at me
With your demon eyes ♪

23:23.311 --> 23:25.728
♪ Coming up in here
With your fancy cocktail ♪

23:25.728 --> 23:27.267
Hey guys, let them through.

23:32.415 --> 23:34.837
- Good to see you Johnny.
- Good to see you, too.

23:34.837 --> 23:36.622
Hey, we're
taking a photo.

23:36.622 --> 23:38.173
Please, I can't
do this by myself.

23:43.409 --> 23:44.536
Have a good night, huh?

23:44.536 --> 23:46.720
- Please enjoy yourselves.
- Thank you.

23:57.091 --> 23:58.601
I don't have your money yet.

23:59.672 --> 24:02.877
Well, I'm not surprised, since obviously
you went and spent it all on this joint.

24:03.009 --> 24:06.223
This? Deficit finance.

24:06.686 --> 24:08.227
Cash is a whole other thing.

24:09.020 --> 24:11.434
Don't worry,
I'll get your money.

24:11.912 --> 24:12.945
That's good to know,

24:12.945 --> 24:15.160
because Thommo's family
is doing it pretty tough.

24:18.239 --> 24:19.492
Hey Johnny.

24:19.627 --> 24:23.018
This is unreal, mate.
Well done.

24:24.765 --> 24:26.142
Shit, was that a compliment?

24:26.142 --> 24:27.365
Get fucked.

24:29.515 --> 24:31.281
So all these
new faces in town,

24:31.281 --> 24:32.777
I hear they're
interested in you.

24:33.899 --> 24:35.020
There's a guy down the road

24:35.020 --> 24:37.285
in the Holiday Inn,
on surveillance.

24:37.285 --> 24:39.293
Every time I leave the club,
I give him a wave.

24:41.259 --> 24:44.806
Elizabeth Doyle,
is the one to watch.

24:46.419 --> 24:49.317
Now, listen if she comes
around asking questions,

24:49.317 --> 24:52.360
mentions my name,
you'll let me know?

24:52.646 --> 24:53.980
I'll let you know.

24:55.027 --> 24:56.086
Have a good night.

24:56.086 --> 24:57.047
Mark.

24:57.047 --> 24:59.232
- How are you John?
- Hey.

25:25.564 --> 25:27.514
Sam, thought we'd
lost you for good.

25:27.514 --> 25:29.225
Yeah, yeah,
collection for upstairs.

25:29.225 --> 25:30.325
It's already been collected.

25:30.755 --> 25:31.688
Who?

25:31.965 --> 25:32.941
John.

25:33.125 --> 25:34.159
John does downstairs.

25:34.159 --> 25:36.529
Well, this morning he did
downstairs and upstairs.

25:37.194 --> 25:38.397
What, he didn't tell you?

25:48.117 --> 25:49.939
Next time, you wait for me.

25:51.684 --> 25:53.200
Take it up with your brother.

25:56.459 --> 25:57.994
I noticed last night.

25:59.680 --> 26:00.989
Who is it?

26:00.989 --> 26:04.237
Could be Jaslyn, Freddy,
could be Deano.

26:04.839 --> 26:05.916
How much are we talking?

26:10.912 --> 26:12.184
I'll catch you later.

26:21.772 --> 26:23.005
Smooth.

26:24.459 --> 26:26.564
Haven't lost your touch
with the ladies, I see.

26:26.804 --> 26:27.937
Huh?

26:29.526 --> 26:30.867
It's good to see you.

26:32.386 --> 26:33.833
You want a coffee?

26:34.253 --> 26:35.752
No.

26:37.211 --> 26:38.247
How you been?

26:38.660 --> 26:39.701
Fine.

26:46.232 --> 26:47.832
I heard you collected
from Steph.

26:47.832 --> 26:49.892
Yeah, I just didn't know
where you were at, so.

26:50.487 --> 26:51.985
Yeah, don't try that again.

26:57.074 --> 26:58.450
Been calling you.

26:59.658 --> 27:00.967
You don't answer.

27:02.788 --> 27:04.050
Where you been?

27:04.790 --> 27:06.442
None of your
fucking business.

27:06.875 --> 27:09.176
- Busy.
- Busy?

27:11.166 --> 27:12.583
What with?

27:13.515 --> 27:15.271
Sam, people rely on us now,

27:16.573 --> 27:18.742
employees, customers,
the whole Strip.

27:20.880 --> 27:22.285
I need you here.

27:22.934 --> 27:24.410
Fuck...

27:25.035 --> 27:28.008
- Sounds like an order.
- No, it's not an order, just...

27:31.056 --> 27:32.470
You tell me what you want,

27:34.136 --> 27:37.527
because I've done my bit,
I've expanded the team.

27:38.603 --> 27:39.542
Who?

27:39.794 --> 27:45.645
Levi, Commando Nick, Karate
Steve, Mr. Puck, a few others,

27:45.645 --> 27:49.295
they're all your guys and
they're ready, they're waiting.

27:49.295 --> 27:52.766
Just look, I'm happy to pick
up the rest of the slack,

27:52.766 --> 27:54.991
I just,

27:56.089 --> 27:58.605
there's some shit that needs
sorting is all I'm saying.

27:59.845 --> 28:01.697
Like this cop that you bashed.

28:03.169 --> 28:05.299
His friends are after
you to stitch you up.

28:07.037 --> 28:09.173
It's not funny, they want
to run a scrum on you.

28:09.173 --> 28:11.838
Oh yeah? Well, you
can sort the Jacks out,

28:11.838 --> 28:12.745
it's what you're
good at, isn't it?

28:12.745 --> 28:15.167
I can't help you if I
can't reach you, Sam.

28:20.219 --> 28:21.507
Help me?

28:28.746 --> 28:30.096
Wow.

28:40.325 --> 28:42.130
Look, I know you're
still upset about Nasa.

28:42.130 --> 28:43.676
Don't talk to me about Nasa.

28:48.666 --> 28:52.906
Ew, boss, all good, huh?

28:53.340 --> 28:55.184
Some nice, fresh water here.

28:55.969 --> 28:57.512
Sammy.

29:16.707 --> 29:19.612
Hey Habibi, you should probably take it
easy, yeah, get some rest?

29:23.719 --> 29:25.028
I'll sleep when I'm dead.

29:27.877 --> 29:29.915
You know, we should think about
doing some business together.

29:30.336 --> 29:32.297
There's a fuck tonne of
money to be made, brother,

29:32.297 --> 29:35.338
a fuck tonne and the stuff is
so easy to shift,

29:35.447 --> 29:36.592
just like that.

29:38.089 --> 29:39.202
I mean, maybe that's
why your brother

29:39.202 --> 29:41.039
didn't want me dealing
in Stripparama that time.

29:43.316 --> 29:45.755
Just saying he's a smart
cookie, I'm sure he's in on it.

29:45.755 --> 29:47.286
No way, not John.

29:47.286 --> 29:48.532
Sure about that?

29:51.198 --> 29:53.205
And as for that dumb fuck,
Joey Romano,

29:53.458 --> 29:54.858
the balls on that bloke.

29:55.732 --> 29:58.867
Listen, Sam, all I'm saying
is I've got contacts,

29:59.194 --> 30:02.187
I know people, cuz, I'm
serious, we can compete,

30:02.354 --> 30:03.830
drive Joey out of business.

30:03.960 --> 30:05.554
You've got the skills,
you've got the network,

30:05.554 --> 30:08.185
you've got the respect on
the street, I can help you.

30:21.750 --> 30:22.834
Shit.

30:34.326 --> 30:36.739
Surprise, it's just me.

30:40.411 --> 30:41.619
What do you want?

30:43.978 --> 30:46.831
Um, I-I got you a burger.

30:47.391 --> 30:49.921
I thought you might have
a case of the munchies.

30:53.732 --> 30:55.317
Thanks.

30:56.669 --> 31:02.248
Um, it seems like you're going
through a really rough time

31:02.695 --> 31:06.007
and I just wanted to let you
know that I'm here for you.

31:13.939 --> 31:15.378
I want to help you.

31:21.850 --> 31:23.122
Let's get out of here,

31:24.429 --> 31:25.662
get some fresh air.

31:48.435 --> 31:49.263
Cunni what?

31:49.263 --> 31:50.810
Cuntilingus.

31:50.810 --> 31:52.769
- ...lingus!
- I can't fucking pronounce it.

31:52.769 --> 31:55.179
It's because it's
fucking Latin, man.

31:55.179 --> 31:56.596
It's cunnilingus,
I told you.

31:56.596 --> 31:58.803
He's fucking
Mr. Know It All, here.

32:00.129 --> 32:02.968
Hey, Johnny!

32:03.449 --> 32:04.748
What's this clicking shit?

32:05.637 --> 32:07.902
Hey, Demi, Demi!

32:09.451 --> 32:10.666
Where are you going?

32:11.584 --> 32:13.345
Um, I'm quitting.

32:14.520 --> 32:15.367
You're what?

32:15.367 --> 32:16.150
Please don't make it worse,
just let me go.

32:16.150 --> 32:18.897
No, no, no, don't, don't give
me that shit, talk to me.

32:18.897 --> 32:20.490
Something happen, someone
do something to you?

32:20.490 --> 32:23.149
No, I just, look, I really
need to get out of this space.

32:23.149 --> 32:24.784
You're in trouble,
you need money?

32:25.881 --> 32:27.077
What's going on?

32:29.058 --> 32:30.369
It's Sam.

32:32.008 --> 32:32.808
What about Sam?

32:32.808 --> 32:35.156
You know, I used to,
I used to really think

32:35.156 --> 32:36.500
he was one of the
best people I know

32:36.500 --> 32:38.320
and now he's just
a fucking cokehead.

32:40.173 --> 32:41.396
Do you know that?

32:47.066 --> 32:48.401
Bullshit.

32:50.717 --> 32:52.238
You're going to lose him,

32:53.062 --> 32:55.603
and I really can't
be around to watch.

32:55.806 --> 32:59.185
- I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.
- Demi, Demi, Demi.

33:00.441 --> 33:01.482
Come talk to him.

33:03.252 --> 33:05.965
Please come with me,
we can do this together.

33:05.965 --> 33:07.025
Take care of each other.

34:01.933 --> 34:03.353
Everybody out.

34:04.085 --> 34:06.550
Bro, relax, all right,
we're just doing...

34:12.201 --> 34:13.429
Get them out of here.

34:13.429 --> 34:14.469
Let's go, ladies.

34:21.606 --> 34:22.782
I taught you that.

34:26.966 --> 34:28.130
What is this?

34:30.525 --> 34:31.757
What's wrong with you?

34:33.459 --> 34:35.338
Why, why, how come
everyone's so concerned

34:35.338 --> 34:36.405
about how the fuck I am?

34:36.405 --> 34:37.605
Because this isn't you.

34:38.378 --> 34:39.931
I don't know what
the fuck this is.

34:42.441 --> 34:44.360
You used to be a
dead-set hero to people.

34:46.164 --> 34:47.568
- To me...
- Man, shut up with that bullshit.

34:47.568 --> 34:49.359
Our famous Sam Ibrahim.

34:50.612 --> 34:52.967
The guy who used to bash me
for smoking in mum's backyard,

34:52.967 --> 34:53.906
don't you remember?

34:53.906 --> 34:56.181
Yeah, we're not kids anymore.

34:56.181 --> 34:57.467
Well, what are we then, huh?

34:58.749 --> 35:00.391
We fucking junkies?

35:03.790 --> 35:06.425
People respect you, Sam,
because you're not like this,

35:06.425 --> 35:08.542
- you're a straight shooter.
- Shut up, mate.

35:10.079 --> 35:12.016
You're like an older
brother to a lot of guys.

35:12.016 --> 35:13.096
I said shut up.

35:13.493 --> 35:14.647
You're like a father to me.

35:27.699 --> 35:29.278
I need you back, Sam.

35:32.065 --> 35:34.070
I can't do all this
by myself.

35:35.125 --> 35:36.676
I need you beside me.

35:41.828 --> 35:43.420
All this shit, just...

35:47.975 --> 35:49.292
Just stop.

35:53.564 --> 35:54.757
Just stop.

36:06.585 --> 36:08.187
You know, when I was a kid,

36:11.525 --> 36:13.252
I would've followed
you anywhere.

36:42.532 --> 36:43.739
Ah.

36:45.713 --> 36:47.902
Ah, we don't open for
three hours, who are you?

36:47.902 --> 36:53.420
Mr. Ibrahim, sorry to barge
in, Liz Doyle, Luke O'Neill,

36:53.420 --> 36:56.226
we're investigators with
the Kings Cross Taskforce.

36:56.226 --> 36:57.998
You've probably seen us around.

36:58.086 --> 37:01.522
I met you briefly at the
Cosmopolitan back in September.

37:03.159 --> 37:04.218
AFP, right?

37:04.355 --> 37:05.899
Ah, she is, I'm not.

37:06.919 --> 37:09.590
I don't mean to be rude,
but I don't talk to cops,

37:10.443 --> 37:12.344
honest ones anyway.

37:12.987 --> 37:15.435
Well, that's unfortunate
because we're interested

37:15.435 --> 37:18.715
in the murder of your
friend, Nasa Kalouri.

37:19.332 --> 37:22.240
We believe you were one of the
last people to see him alive.

37:24.871 --> 37:27.398
The last person to see him alive
was the person who killed him.

37:28.665 --> 37:29.833
Please, the exit's that way.

37:29.833 --> 37:32.135
What was the last conversation
you had with him that night?

37:32.369 --> 37:34.662
I think it was about
garlic sauce.

37:34.815 --> 37:37.869
Yeah, word on the street is
you're now doing Nasa's work,

37:38.218 --> 37:41.272
shot caller, we've heard
it's pretty lucrative.

37:41.607 --> 37:43.748
It's a classic motive, John.

37:44.385 --> 37:46.118
Do you mind if I call you John?

37:46.758 --> 37:48.057
Can I call you Mary?

37:50.378 --> 37:52.742
So you guys are
in Homicide, really?

37:52.742 --> 37:54.188
We're just looking
into Nasa's murder

37:54.188 --> 37:56.515
in the context of a
wider investigation.

37:56.838 --> 37:58.327
And you think
I'm good for it?

38:00.453 --> 38:01.751
Are you?

38:03.219 --> 38:04.759
What was the date again?

38:04.759 --> 38:07.016
Tuesday the
12th of September.

38:07.527 --> 38:09.501
- Time?
- 11:05 p.m.

38:09.501 --> 38:12.010
Yeah, see, Tuesday night's my
poker night, they run late,

38:12.010 --> 38:12.990
so it's unlikely.

38:12.990 --> 38:15.011
We'd just love to have
a good, old-fashioned

38:15.011 --> 38:16.045
chin wag with you,

38:16.045 --> 38:17.877
just get your take on
what goes on here.

38:17.877 --> 38:20.562
Who's up who and why,
how it all works,

38:20.562 --> 38:21.909
the system, the players.

38:21.909 --> 38:24.026
Why Detective Sergeant
Bryan Crellan

38:24.026 --> 38:26.148
seems to be everywhere
the action is.

38:35.781 --> 38:37.989
I told you
I don't talk to cops.

38:40.596 --> 38:41.823
Hm.

38:42.793 --> 38:43.943
Catch you later, Mary.

38:47.127 --> 38:49.110
Oh, she obviously knows
every one of us,

38:49.110 --> 38:52.396
who we are, what we do, she's
trying to shake things loose.

38:53.198 --> 38:55.400
She's trying to fix
me up for Nasa.

38:56.590 --> 38:58.091
She closing in on you, is she?

38:58.543 --> 39:00.005
What the fuck does that mean?

39:04.407 --> 39:07.103
Listen, he was our friend,
me and Sam want to find out

39:07.103 --> 39:08.960
who did it just as much
as the Jacks do.

39:09.706 --> 39:11.133
How's Sam doing?

39:11.691 --> 39:13.137
What do you mean?

39:13.896 --> 39:15.424
- He's good.
- Yeah?

39:16.061 --> 39:17.744
Well, I'll tell you what,
you get him sobered up

39:17.744 --> 39:19.435
and get him back to
fucking work, all right?

39:19.435 --> 39:22.157
This place relies on order
now more than ever, John.

39:22.959 --> 39:24.738
So just fucking
pull him into line.

39:25.059 --> 39:26.855
He needs to do his job,
do you understand?

39:28.532 --> 39:29.779
And we're done.

39:36.807 --> 39:38.267
This Taskforce thing.

39:38.373 --> 39:40.041
Yeah. All right.

39:42.552 --> 39:44.926
Oh, you know that thing
we talked about?

39:47.019 --> 39:49.813
Get it done, yeah?

39:51.289 --> 39:52.490
Yeah, mate.

40:58.915 --> 41:00.872
- Well it depends which way...
- He did.

41:00.872 --> 41:03.518
- Well who told you Billie?
- Yes exactly, who told you?

41:03.518 --> 41:04.844
His math teacher...

41:28.405 --> 41:29.458
Luke.

41:44.569 --> 41:46.474
Oh, that fucking
smart arse.

41:46.976 --> 41:49.228
Come on, you didn't
really think he did it?

41:50.666 --> 41:51.777
You know what though?

41:52.232 --> 41:54.824
I bet he knows everything
that goes on up here,

41:54.824 --> 41:56.411
just where all the
bodies are buried

41:56.411 --> 41:58.588
and it's just a matter
of putting him

41:58.588 --> 42:00.276
between a rock
and a hard place.

42:00.636 --> 42:04.260
Just convincing him his only
rational option is to tell all.

42:10.076 --> 42:11.813
You're never going
to stop the blow-ins,

42:11.813 --> 42:14.763
so why not sanction those of
us who've been around a while?

42:15.484 --> 42:17.798
Sam, let me work the street,

42:18.124 --> 42:19.641
give my guys a place,
some protection.

42:20.022 --> 42:22.392
We'll get two runners per
dealer selling at a bus stop here

42:22.392 --> 42:23.938
and a street corner there,
no overlap.

42:24.251 --> 42:25.738
You keep the shit out,

42:25.738 --> 42:27.715
I'll manage the boys
and pay you a fat cut.

42:28.364 --> 42:30.243
This will create order,
you know,

42:30.243 --> 42:32.413
which solves a big problem
for your dumb brother too.

42:35.213 --> 42:37.577
Mention my brother again
and I'll snap your neck.

42:37.577 --> 42:39.435
Yeah, yeah, no, sure, no.

42:39.435 --> 42:42.197
All I meant was he
can get in the way, of us.

42:42.197 --> 42:43.411
No offence meant.

42:44.710 --> 42:47.527
Habibi you're going to make ten
times as much as you do now.

42:47.527 --> 42:49.493
Yeah, yeah, sounds
too good to be true.

42:49.493 --> 42:50.759
It's 100 percent true.

42:50.759 --> 42:52.435
How are you going to
manage all of this?

42:52.897 --> 42:54.696
Where do you get the product
from, who the fuck do you know?

42:54.696 --> 42:56.606
I know certain people, all
right, I have contacts.

42:56.606 --> 42:57.913
Contacts?

42:58.033 --> 42:59.632
Bullshit, you're
a fucking clown.

42:59.632 --> 43:02.636
No, brother,
this is once in a lifetime.

43:12.255 --> 43:15.926
Just give me a chance, all
right, let me show you.

43:24.686 --> 43:27.160
All right, show me.

43:47.882 --> 43:48.815
All right.

43:48.815 --> 43:49.917
Hey.

44:02.518 --> 44:04.013
So how did you go?

44:06.148 --> 44:07.506
Your meeting?

44:07.905 --> 44:10.265
Yeah, good, he's in,
I reckon.

44:10.882 --> 44:12.269
So when
do we begin?

44:12.269 --> 44:15.889
Soon I guess, but I haven't
been paid properly yet, so.

44:17.366 --> 44:20.062
Of course, you've done
great work for us.

44:20.232 --> 44:21.835
So how much did we say?

44:21.835 --> 44:24.896
We didn't, but listen,
I swear I can make this

44:24.896 --> 44:27.326
worth your while if you can
make it mine, all right?

44:27.326 --> 44:29.963
I'm like Sam's lieutenant,
he listens to me.

44:30.319 --> 44:34.926
No doubt, you a power player,
that's why we came to you.

44:35.526 --> 44:36.568
So?

44:38.285 --> 44:39.947
A couple of ounces, halas.

44:40.823 --> 44:42.415
Hey, fair is fair.

45:06.973 --> 45:08.294
For your trouble.

45:10.005 --> 45:12.569
But I want a meeting
with him alone.

45:12.569 --> 45:15.145
It's not an issue, I can
arrange anything you want.

45:15.259 --> 45:18.160
All right, he's ready to
collaborate, believe me.

45:18.160 --> 45:20.191
- Thank you, Mansour.
- Yeah, you're welcome, all right.

45:20.191 --> 45:24.480
Hey, keep this up, I'm happy
to be of service, all right.

45:25.291 --> 45:26.589
Thanks, boys.

45:26.720 --> 45:27.908
Yalla.

45:55.539 --> 45:57.386
Hey, boys,
boys, boys, boys!

45:57.386 --> 46:00.023
Porky's has got the best
naked meat in the street!

46:00.023 --> 46:01.654
Boys, upstairs at Porky's.

46:01.654 --> 46:03.120
Hey, guys, guys,

46:03.120 --> 46:04.751
we've got glamours,
we've got machines,

46:04.751 --> 46:06.074
we've got everything
you need.

46:06.074 --> 46:07.107
Watch this.

46:07.107 --> 46:09.709
- Hey, Buck!
- Good, yeah.

46:10.646 --> 46:11.789
Yeah, Johnny?

46:11.960 --> 46:13.237
Ask him what the numbers are.

46:13.237 --> 46:14.425
No worries, no worries, cuz.

46:15.303 --> 46:16.302
Casey, man?

46:16.302 --> 46:19.831
Yeah, 300, top.

46:21.428 --> 46:23.561
Yeah, Stripperama
is about 300, he says.

46:23.561 --> 46:25.200
No, it's 250,
he's lying, ask him again.

46:25.200 --> 46:26.027
What?

46:26.027 --> 46:28.248
Hey, donkey,
don't lie to me!

46:28.248 --> 46:29.352
Did he say something
about your mother?

46:29.352 --> 46:30.627
What, what you talking
about my mum?

46:30.627 --> 46:33.227
Hey, get back to work.

46:33.227 --> 46:35.223
Hey, fellas, fellas,
fellas, fellas!

46:35.223 --> 46:37.920
We've got machines,

46:37.920 --> 46:38.840
we've got everything you need.

46:38.840 --> 46:40.609
Hey, hey, hey, it's a jungle in here,

46:40.609 --> 46:42.248
watch out,
watch out, watch out.

46:44.032 --> 46:46.312
We've got the best
titties in the Cross!

46:46.744 --> 46:48.073
Ezra's here.

46:52.102 --> 46:53.772
Ladies, ladies!

46:55.154 --> 46:57.828
Fellas, fellas, fellas,
upstairs, talking!

46:58.810 --> 47:01.054
Hey, man, hey, over here!

47:03.073 --> 47:04.231
Smiles.

47:04.231 --> 47:05.544
Ah, it's a good day.

47:05.544 --> 47:07.295
Oh, good for you.

47:08.458 --> 47:09.652
I sorted that problem.

47:09.652 --> 47:12.411
Doyle's got nothing, she
can't tie me to Nasa anymore.

47:15.996 --> 47:18.509
I think we've got
our wires crossed.

47:25.094 --> 47:26.387
Oops!

47:31.745 --> 47:33.602
I didn't ask you to do this.

47:33.798 --> 47:37.119
This guy's a nobody,
he's not a threat to us.

47:37.119 --> 47:38.871
Well, he might've
become a threat,

47:39.069 --> 47:40.278
one day.

47:42.104 --> 47:43.766
Better to be safe
than sorry.

47:45.962 --> 47:47.523
My mum used to say that.

48:04.680 --> 48:05.979
What do you think?

48:07.199 --> 48:08.639
We'll see.

48:34.358 --> 48:35.444
Hello, mate.

48:36.080 --> 48:39.229
There's a hundred there,
a bit more.

48:40.869 --> 48:42.884
Make sure you get Sam
off the shit list.

48:44.998 --> 48:46.787
You're a good brother, Johnny.

48:47.561 --> 48:48.958
I hope he sees that.

48:50.707 --> 48:53.392
Liz Doyle, has she made
contact with you yet?

48:53.879 --> 48:56.602
Yeah, you're right,
she's looking at me.

48:57.917 --> 49:01.412
She's also pretty interested
in you and your mates.

49:01.412 --> 49:04.680
Yeah, we know,
we've seen it all before.

49:04.680 --> 49:08.066
She's just a lapdog
for politicians,

49:08.066 --> 49:10.043
who think that they
can reform this all

49:10.043 --> 49:12.766
and make front page heroes of
themselves at the same time.

49:13.693 --> 49:15.363
She's looking for a weak link.

49:16.027 --> 49:18.142
- Of course she is.
- She's not your standard Jack.

49:18.142 --> 49:19.215
No.

49:19.215 --> 49:20.452
Something...

49:22.197 --> 49:23.445
...different.

49:24.385 --> 49:26.693
Like you said, one to watch.

49:27.294 --> 49:29.939
Johnny, all we have
to do is stay staunch,

49:29.939 --> 49:31.407
keep our mouths shut

49:31.407 --> 49:34.077
and she and her mates
go home empty-handed

49:34.077 --> 49:36.814
just like anyone else that's
ever tried to take us down.

49:41.106 --> 49:42.431
We'll be all right.
