Vo,
when you went to West Point,

38:09.488 --> 38:13.525
did you ever hear the military
term "left of boom?"

38:13.592 --> 38:16.662
Yeah, my dad used to say it,
but I never knew what it meant.

38:16.728 --> 38:19.965
Well, the boom is when
the bomb goes off, right?

38:20.031 --> 38:23.001
The gun is fired,
the damage is done.

38:23.068 --> 38:26.538
You want to be left of boom
to get ahead of it.

38:28.173 --> 38:31.242
Don't make a case personal
and miss the warning signs.
