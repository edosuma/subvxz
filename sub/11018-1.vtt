01:21.760 --> 01:23.398
Oi, get up!

01:31.560 --> 01:33.039
Did you drink all o' them?

01:33.120 --> 01:35.680
No. Boz had some too.

01:43.240 --> 01:44.593
Phone's ringing.

01:57.240 --> 01:58.355
<i>Hello?</i>

02:05.720 --> 02:07.631
- Who was it?
- Wrong number.

02:13.720 --> 02:14.835
I'm still ill!

02:14.920 --> 02:16.353
Maybe you shouldn't have
got munted on a school night.

02:16.440 --> 02:18.158
They're all gimps at that school.

02:18.240 --> 02:20.151
Well, you'll fit right in then,
won't you?

02:20.240 --> 02:21.309
Funny!

02:29.840 --> 02:30.989
Go on.

02:44.960 --> 02:46.279
What you doing?

02:47.440 --> 02:48.589
Dropped my pen!

02:48.680 --> 02:50.989
Get in there, stop messing about!

02:53.560 --> 02:54.709
Dad!

02:57.200 --> 02:59.156
- Dad!
- Granddad!

02:59.640 --> 03:00.914
Granddad!

03:01.880 --> 03:02.915
Oh, bollocks!

03:06.560 --> 03:07.913
Oi!

03:09.720 --> 03:10.914
You're getting worse!

03:11.000 --> 03:12.592
- Hat! Goggles!
- Yeah.

03:13.560 --> 03:15.676
Come on, hurry up.

03:19.160 --> 03:21.151
Jonas, where am I putting these, mate?

03:21.240 --> 03:22.832
Over there on the right.

03:26.200 --> 03:29.875
Here, love.
Take this and give my best to T.

03:31.480 --> 03:32.833
You don't have to pay me or nothing.

03:32.920 --> 03:35.036
No, love, it's a tenner. It's for a cab.

03:38.840 --> 03:40.910
Right. Thanks.

04:11.840 --> 04:13.796
- Homework, yeah?
- Yeah.

04:15.920 --> 04:17.558
<i>Double Kick-Ass, is it?</i>

04:27.960 --> 04:29.712
Where'd you get the comic from anyway?

04:30.360 --> 04:31.554
Swapped it.

04:31.640 --> 04:33.392
For what? You ain't got nothing
to swap it with.

04:33.480 --> 04:34.469
Fags.

04:34.560 --> 04:35.834
Fags! Where'd you get fags from?

04:35.920 --> 04:37.592
- Swapped 'em!
- For what?

04:38.040 --> 04:39.189
Trainers!

04:39.280 --> 04:41.077
I've told you, no nicking!

04:41.680 --> 04:43.796
Not nicking! Swapping!

04:49.600 --> 04:50.874
What we got for dinner?

04:50.960 --> 04:51.949
Toast.

05:07.440 --> 05:09.795
Oh, I'm gonna get the right piss
taken out of me now!

05:09.880 --> 05:11.313
Yeah, well, you do the washing then!

05:11.400 --> 05:13.277
I'm not going to school
till I get another shirt!

05:18.240 --> 05:19.639
Hold on, stay there.

05:26.360 --> 05:27.918
Who is it?
- Shh.

05:32.680 --> 05:34.989
Hello? Hello?

05:54.560 --> 05:55.959
- Hello, mate.
- What?

05:56.040 --> 05:58.634
I'm just looking for
the people that live opposite.

05:58.720 --> 05:59.675
And?

05:59.760 --> 06:01.478
And do you know if they still live there?

06:01.560 --> 06:02.788
A woman and two kids?

06:02.880 --> 06:05.838
I don't know nothing.
Flat is empty. Now fuck youse!

06:08.400 --> 06:11.278
Got another little skank
up the duff now, have you, you dirty bastard?

06:11.360 --> 06:13.828
Ain't you created enough misery in your life?

06:14.800 --> 06:16.392
Have a word.

06:37.680 --> 06:39.033
What you doing?

06:39.120 --> 06:40.997
Oh, come on, T!

06:41.560 --> 06:43.710
Sorted out the turban for you, didn't I?

06:44.120 --> 06:46.395
And what? Not till I say so!

06:50.280 --> 06:51.679
Yeah? Make it good.

06:52.480 --> 06:53.993
Yeah, hello, T.

06:58.720 --> 06:59.994
You sure?

07:02.120 --> 07:04.270
- Well, stone me!
- You all right, Keith?

07:04.840 --> 07:06.193
I thought I barred you for life.

07:06.440 --> 07:08.431
Sure that werert some other geezer?

07:09.480 --> 07:11.436
Nah, yeah. It was me, yeah.

07:11.520 --> 07:13.590
Seems like only yesterday you got sent down.

07:13.680 --> 07:15.238
Bloody hell, time flies, dunnit?

07:15.320 --> 07:16.799
Not inside, it don't.

07:16.880 --> 07:18.154
The usual?

07:18.720 --> 07:21.234
Ten pints, two grams and a punch-up?

07:21.600 --> 07:22.953
Seriously, no trouble, right?

07:24.560 --> 07:25.913
All right. I'm out on licence.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.956
If my dog shits on the pavement,
I get 18 months.

07:28.320 --> 07:31.357
I mean, she's like a proper skepler, I tell you.

07:31.440 --> 07:34.079
Her face was all roughed up and shit.

07:35.200 --> 07:36.952
I mean, I bashed it...

07:40.160 --> 07:41.149
All right?

07:41.280 --> 07:43.475
Can't say I've seen them
for a while, me old son.

07:43.920 --> 07:46.878
I knocked next door. Some big Russian lump
come out and coated me off.

07:46.960 --> 07:50.509
Probably a Polish builder.
People have got the 'ump that they're here.

07:51.120 --> 07:54.237
I don't mind them.
Don't mind getting their hands dirty.

07:54.320 --> 07:58.677
British kids would much rather
sing like a bender in front of Simon Cowell.

07:58.760 --> 08:00.512
I don't suppose you'd know
who he is, would you?

08:00.600 --> 08:03.194
No, course I do.
It was our favourite programme in jail.

08:03.280 --> 08:04.508
Run a book on it and everything.

08:04.600 --> 08:06.079
Sounds like you miss it already.

08:06.160 --> 08:07.878
Do I, fuck!

08:08.920 --> 08:10.911
I ain't never going back, mate.
It nearly killed me.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.753
Oi! What the fuck
you doing in my boozer?

08:14.960 --> 08:15.995
You what?

08:16.080 --> 08:18.548
See, what did I tell you?

08:18.640 --> 08:20.631
Geezer's a top-class nut job!

08:20.720 --> 08:22.278
Yeah, back in the day, yeah.

08:22.360 --> 08:24.032
Look at him. Wild Bill!

08:26.800 --> 08:28.119
Bill. It's me, T.

08:30.280 --> 08:31.269
Little Terry?

08:31.880 --> 08:35.111
Yeah. Well, no. Everyone calls me T now.

08:36.720 --> 08:38.073
Who was he? Social worker?

08:38.159 --> 08:39.592
Don't know. Arsehole.

08:40.480 --> 08:41.832
What'd he look like?

08:42.760 --> 08:44.398
Like nothing. He look like arsehole.

08:47.120 --> 08:48.872
Um, look, you got any sugar?

08:50.720 --> 08:52.199
<i>I've got medus, honey.</i>

08:52.600 --> 08:53.919
Yo, Victor!

08:55.120 --> 08:56.712
One sec. Yo, Victor!

08:58.200 --> 09:00.555
So what you gonna be doing,
now you're out?

09:01.200 --> 09:03.998
Might go up north.
Do a bit of graft on the oil rigs.

09:04.080 --> 09:07.197
- Up north?
- Sod that. Come work for me, Bill.

09:07.280 --> 09:09.191
Good money in it,
thanks to all the Bobski the Builders

09:09.280 --> 09:10.679
who've moved into the area.

09:10.760 --> 09:11.954
They're all bang on it.

09:12.040 --> 09:14.600
Next year we're gonna make a killing.
We got the Olympics coming, innit.

09:14.680 --> 09:16.716
These are boom times
for everyone in the borough, Bill,

09:16.800 --> 09:18.233
not just the javelin shops!

09:18.320 --> 09:20.072
Go on. Weigh him in.

09:20.720 --> 09:22.153
Safe!

09:24.280 --> 09:27.158
Here, hold that. Set yourself up.
Stick it on the slate.

09:28.080 --> 09:29.752
No, here y'are. Look, I can't.

09:29.840 --> 09:31.432
Don't insult me, Bill, just take it.

09:32.240 --> 09:33.753
Oi, oi. Good girl.

09:35.280 --> 09:36.633
Come on, then! Get it down ya!

09:41.200 --> 09:43.031
You're gonna need some fortifications!

09:45.360 --> 09:46.349
What?

09:47.120 --> 09:48.394
I got you a present.

09:50.160 --> 09:51.752
Dunno if you remember Roxy.

09:52.360 --> 09:54.157
- All right, Bill.
- She's proper filth, mate.

09:54.240 --> 09:56.800
You can do anything with her.
Absolutely anything!

09:58.200 --> 10:00.236
There ain't many who ain't, is there, babe?

10:03.960 --> 10:05.871
Work it, girl! Work it, girl!

10:05.960 --> 10:09.669
That's it! Look at him!
He don't know what to do with it!

10:11.160 --> 10:12.513
Is that for me?

10:15.680 --> 10:19.355
Open up. Open the fucking door!

10:22.480 --> 10:24.869
Come on! I wanna go home!

10:26.480 --> 10:27.435
Here, look.

10:27.520 --> 10:29.272
Come on, we know you're in there!

10:29.880 --> 10:32.519
Open the fucking door, we ain't going back!

10:32.600 --> 10:33.999
Stay there. Stay there.

10:34.960 --> 10:36.393
Open the door!

10:47.320 --> 10:48.833
About time.
Wait, who are you?

10:48.920 --> 10:50.148
What's going on?

10:50.640 --> 10:52.631
Get the light on.
- You can't come in here.

10:52.720 --> 10:54.836
- Seriously, what's going on?
You got it, yeah?

10:54.920 --> 10:56.717
Someone tell me what is going on.

10:58.320 --> 11:00.072
Here, hang on, boys. Who's that?

11:00.520 --> 11:01.669
That?

11:02.000 --> 11:03.672
That is your old man!

11:04.240 --> 11:05.992
He's a fucking legend!

11:07.880 --> 11:09.518
Come on, soppy bollocks.

11:18.200 --> 11:19.679
He stinks.

11:23.200 --> 11:24.428
Great!

11:53.640 --> 11:54.959
Where am I?

11:55.040 --> 11:56.075
That's funny.

11:56.400 --> 11:59.198
'Cause we were wondering the same thing
for the last eight years.

11:59.600 --> 12:00.919
Is it really him?

12:01.680 --> 12:02.669
Looks like it, yeah.

12:04.480 --> 12:05.708
Dean?

12:08.280 --> 12:09.429
My God!

12:17.040 --> 12:18.234
Look at you.

12:21.440 --> 12:22.395
James?

12:22.480 --> 12:25.199
Everyone calls him Jimmy now
and he don't remember you.

12:25.680 --> 12:26.749
All right.

12:29.920 --> 12:31.592
You all right, Jimmy?

12:39.600 --> 12:42.114
Uh, any more of that going?

12:42.200 --> 12:44.077
I'll give you some dough towards it.

12:44.480 --> 12:45.913
Don't worry.

12:47.480 --> 12:49.038
You already did.

12:54.480 --> 12:56.471
Jimmy, get your coat. Go.

12:57.520 --> 12:58.873
So, whers she coming back?

12:58.960 --> 13:00.871
- Ask her.
- Where is she?

13:00.960 --> 13:02.279
Spain, with Jeff.

13:02.520 --> 13:03.794
Spain?

13:04.720 --> 13:05.835
How long ago was this?

13:06.240 --> 13:07.593
- Years.
- Nine months.

13:07.920 --> 13:08.955
Well, why aren't you with her?

13:09.560 --> 13:10.549
Jeff!

13:11.760 --> 13:13.034
What?

13:14.560 --> 13:15.629
She just left you?

13:15.880 --> 13:17.279
What, and you didn't?

13:17.360 --> 13:19.191
Here, hold on. I didn't have no choice!

13:19.280 --> 13:20.759
That's not what she said!

13:22.000 --> 13:22.955
Bitch!

13:23.040 --> 13:25.156
Oi, that's our mum you're talking about!

13:26.960 --> 13:28.393
All right, well...

13:29.400 --> 13:31.277
She ain't a very good mum, is she?

13:31.360 --> 13:32.713
What d'you know about it, eh?

13:33.040 --> 13:34.917
What d'you know about anything?

13:35.280 --> 13:36.315
Look, I'm just saying.

13:36.400 --> 13:37.469
Yeah, well, don't.

13:37.560 --> 13:40.028
'Cause we're not interested
in what you have to say.

13:40.120 --> 13:42.998
We're not interested in what you think.
You are nothing to us!

13:44.680 --> 13:46.910
Get what you need and go.

13:48.800 --> 13:50.791
I don't wanna see you here when I get back.

13:52.720 --> 13:53.869
Come on.

14:15.760 --> 14:18.228
- Okay, no problem. Be calm.
- Don't tell me to be calm, right!

14:18.320 --> 14:21.198
Move 'em from there to... Dean, get here!

14:22.400 --> 14:24.595
- I want those shifted.
- Okay, okay.

14:25.520 --> 14:26.839
Look, Roland, I'm sorry, mate.
It won't happen again.

14:26.920 --> 14:30.276
That's not good enough. Listen, I'm sticking
my neck out just having you on site.

14:30.360 --> 14:31.475
Yeah, I've got some grief at home.

14:31.560 --> 14:32.834
Yeah, and that's my problem because what?

14:34.200 --> 14:35.474
Come here.

14:37.720 --> 14:40.996
Look, I know you're doing your best, right,
and I'll help you out as much as I can,

14:41.080 --> 14:42.433
but you're going to have to help me, yeah?

14:42.520 --> 14:44.192
- Yeah, course.
- You in tonight?

14:44.280 --> 14:45.235
Yeah.

14:45.320 --> 14:47.072
Right, I'm going to drop some more stuff off.

14:47.160 --> 14:48.275
Okay.

14:48.360 --> 14:49.588
Well, go on, then. Grab yourself a shovel.

14:49.680 --> 14:51.079
Build us a velodrome.

14:55.600 --> 14:57.272
- Four sugars.
Thanks.

15:00.520 --> 15:03.990
So, how was your trip home?

15:05.160 --> 15:06.673
Uneventful.

15:07.720 --> 15:09.073
Isle of Wight?

15:09.160 --> 15:10.559
Yeah, Park Hill.

15:10.640 --> 15:13.279
Eight years, two months and three days for...

15:13.360 --> 15:15.715
carrying a concealed weapon,
supplying class A's,

15:15.800 --> 15:18.268
three counts of actual bodily harm,
four grievous

15:18.360 --> 15:20.828
and the attempted murder
of a community support officer.

15:20.920 --> 15:21.989
Well, that's colourful.

15:22.080 --> 15:23.832
Sounds a lot worse than what it was.

15:25.320 --> 15:26.469
Seen the family yet?

15:26.560 --> 15:27.549
A bit.

15:28.320 --> 15:30.038
- How was it?
- All right.

15:31.080 --> 15:32.877
- Boys all right?
- Yeah, they're good, yeah.

15:32.960 --> 15:36.077
They're, um, bigger.

15:38.040 --> 15:40.031
Are you back with your wife,
domestically speaking?

15:40.120 --> 15:42.190
Nah, she's with Jeff, domestically speaking.

15:42.280 --> 15:44.475
I see. How do you feel about that?

15:45.040 --> 15:46.314
Don't know. Fucking relieved.

15:47.560 --> 15:49.198
I'm going up to Scotland anyway.

15:49.640 --> 15:53.349
That's a good idea.
Make a fresh start. Out of harm's way.

15:53.640 --> 15:55.756
Just need to find you someone
to talk to up there.

15:55.840 --> 15:56.875
All right. Lovely.

15:56.960 --> 15:59.474
And we should arrange a meeting with Diane.

15:59.560 --> 16:02.552
Talk about your contact with the boys.
And then we're done.

16:02.640 --> 16:05.279
Shouldrt be too difficult,
she's been in Spain for the last nine months.

16:05.360 --> 16:08.272
Oh. So who's looking after them?

16:08.600 --> 16:09.874
What d'you mean?

16:10.920 --> 16:13.593
Well, it says here that Dears 15
and Jimmy's 11

16:13.680 --> 16:16.513
and they're attending school in Newham,

16:16.600 --> 16:18.670
so who's taking care of the boys?

16:22.040 --> 16:25.032
Well, you know, they've had neighbours
looking in. You know.

16:26.120 --> 16:28.031
Well, Jimmy's only 11.

16:28.120 --> 16:29.838
He needs an adult looking after him.
They both do.

16:30.560 --> 16:32.073
They look fine to me.

16:32.560 --> 16:34.073
Bill, they're children.

16:34.160 --> 16:36.310
No, Dears like, he...

16:36.400 --> 16:38.152
He's very grown up for his age.
Know what I mean?

16:39.280 --> 16:41.510
I am going to have
to inform Child Services about this.

16:41.600 --> 16:42.794
They need to look into it.

16:46.240 --> 16:47.355
Right.

16:47.440 --> 16:49.431
You do realise what this means, don't you?

16:51.160 --> 16:53.355
Yeah. Yeah. They'll need looking after.

16:53.680 --> 16:56.240
Kids don't do well in care, Bill.
You know that.

16:57.040 --> 16:59.031
They're better off with their parents.

16:59.120 --> 17:01.156
Don't stick it on me. I can't look after 'em.

17:01.240 --> 17:03.674
Me pal's waiting for me in Scotland.
It's all organised.

17:03.760 --> 17:04.749
Bill, you're their dad.

17:06.880 --> 17:08.233
I don't really know 'em.

17:14.760 --> 17:17.672
Hello, yeah, can you put me through
to John in Child Services, please.

17:41.360 --> 17:43.510
The social are on their way round.
What have you said?

17:43.720 --> 17:46.280
Me PO was asking about your mum
and I said she ain't about, that's all.

17:46.360 --> 17:47.429
So you grassed us up?

17:47.520 --> 17:49.670
Look, I never grassed no one up.
Just sort of slipped out.

17:50.600 --> 17:51.953
Oh, well, that's all right then.

17:54.320 --> 17:56.231
You werert going to get away with it forever.

17:56.320 --> 17:58.914
We were doing fine until you showed up, Bill!

18:00.880 --> 18:02.154
You're not going.

18:03.320 --> 18:05.959
No. No, you're going to stay here
and you're gonna sort this out

18:06.040 --> 18:08.315
and you're going to tell the social
you're looking after us.

18:08.400 --> 18:09.549
Just stay till Mum gets back.

18:09.840 --> 18:11.319
I told you she ain't coming back!

18:15.600 --> 18:17.272
I don't think I can, son.

18:18.600 --> 18:19.749
No?

18:20.720 --> 18:23.109
Then I'm going to tell the Old Bill
that you're dealing.

18:23.200 --> 18:24.599
Hmm. Don't be stupid.

18:24.880 --> 18:25.915
I've got your coke.

18:29.800 --> 18:31.438
Right, well, you better give me that back now.

18:31.520 --> 18:32.714
No.

18:33.360 --> 18:36.557
I'm gonna grass on you.
Just like you grassed on us.

18:37.200 --> 18:39.350
And they will bang you up again, Bill.

18:39.880 --> 18:40.915
I ain't going back to prison.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.877
Yeah, and we ain't going into care.

18:51.240 --> 18:54.312
I'm serious. You owe us.

19:11.720 --> 19:14.678
As soon as I found out their mum
werert about, I werert going nowhere.

19:14.760 --> 19:15.715
Know what I mean?

19:15.800 --> 19:17.392
You need to start
telling us the truth, all right?

19:17.480 --> 19:18.959
So we know what we're dealing with.

19:19.040 --> 19:21.634
Now, your probation officer was under
the impression you were going away?

19:22.800 --> 19:25.917
Look, I've had a think about it
and I've changed my mind. Is that all right?

19:26.400 --> 19:28.356
Right, well, now that you are staying,

19:28.440 --> 19:30.476
we're not going to instigate
an emergency response,

19:30.560 --> 19:33.313
but we are gonna begin
an investigation under Section 47.

19:33.400 --> 19:35.789
Look, I love my kids and I'm gonna be here.
What more do you want?

19:35.880 --> 19:37.438
A lot, actually.

19:38.520 --> 19:39.555
Do you mind if I call you Bill?

19:39.640 --> 19:41.232
Yeah, I do. Actually.

19:42.280 --> 19:45.113
All right. We're going to need
to take a little look around.

19:45.680 --> 19:47.033
Fill your boots.

19:47.120 --> 19:49.031
So, you're not going up north, then?

19:49.360 --> 19:51.032
Mr Hayward, have you got a moment?

19:56.640 --> 19:58.312
Yeah, I'll run a cloth over that.

19:58.760 --> 20:01.593
Mr Hayward, this is a clear case of neglect.

20:01.960 --> 20:04.872
You need to take your
parental responsibilities seriously

20:04.960 --> 20:07.520
or your kids will be taken away from you.

20:07.600 --> 20:09.158
I understand. I'll get onto it.

20:09.240 --> 20:11.879
Helen. We're done here. Mr Hayward.

20:20.200 --> 20:22.998
Dean seems to be coping,
but I'm worried about James.

20:23.080 --> 20:24.195
I'll keep an eye on him.

20:24.280 --> 20:25.679
Yeah, that'd be good.

20:26.200 --> 20:28.794
How does he feel
about being abandoned by his mum?

20:28.880 --> 20:31.075
- Don't know.
- Well, how do you think he feels?

20:31.160 --> 20:32.639
Have you spoken to him about it?

20:33.080 --> 20:34.957
- No.
- Maybe you should.

20:36.320 --> 20:37.594
All right, I will.

20:39.080 --> 20:40.308
Thanks for stopping by, yeah.

20:40.400 --> 20:42.470
Well, look, we're going back to the office,
but we really need

20:42.560 --> 20:45.028
as much information as possible
to build the bigger picture.

20:45.120 --> 20:47.634
We're going to need to speak
to his teachers and his doctor.

20:47.720 --> 20:49.950
- You know who his doctor is, right?
- Not really, no.

20:50.040 --> 20:51.473
Well, then you're going to have to find out.

20:51.560 --> 20:53.039
And we're going
to have to speak to the police.

20:53.120 --> 20:54.951
- About what?
- Your kids.

20:57.080 --> 20:59.548
It's to decide whether we need
to convene a case conference.

20:59.640 --> 21:02.029
Look, I'll drop by in the next couple of days,
see how you're getting on.

21:02.120 --> 21:03.269
All right. Sweet.

21:03.840 --> 21:05.398
Thanks very much, Mr Hayward.

21:06.120 --> 21:08.475
And, oi. Do something about that flat.

21:23.800 --> 21:25.233
- Happy?
- No!

21:27.240 --> 21:28.719
So what did they say?

21:28.800 --> 21:31.712
They're coming back in a couple of days.
They need some time to make a decision.

21:31.800 --> 21:33.028
Okay. So you need to be here.

21:34.280 --> 21:35.429
All right, I get it!

21:35.520 --> 21:37.272
Yeah, and you can leave
as soon as they're off our backs.

21:37.360 --> 21:38.395
Don't worry, I will.

21:38.920 --> 21:40.433
Good. You get the sofa.

21:41.480 --> 21:42.515
Good!

21:43.800 --> 21:44.835
Fucking dickhead!

21:45.600 --> 21:47.511
Have a good one.

21:52.360 --> 21:53.952
I was gonna get some chicken.

21:54.720 --> 21:57.632
Get some rice. Make a nice curry.

22:00.040 --> 22:01.473
Lost me wallet.

22:10.160 --> 22:13.197
Why haven't you taken the baby
to my fucking mother's?

22:13.280 --> 22:14.759
You know what she's like.

22:15.520 --> 22:18.512
- You fucking bitch! I'll knock you out!
- Shut up.

22:18.600 --> 22:20.431
Don't you fucking go away from me!
I'll knock you out!

22:20.520 --> 22:21.589
Come on. Mummy take you out.

22:21.680 --> 22:23.079
You too, you old drunk!

22:23.160 --> 22:25.037
Just ignore him, Dad. He'll go away.

22:32.040 --> 22:33.314
Don't stay in bed all day.

22:33.880 --> 22:35.233
Make sure Jimmy gets to school.

22:37.880 --> 22:39.791
He's the bully. He started it!

22:40.080 --> 22:42.435
I always get in trouble for this kind of stuff.

22:43.440 --> 22:44.634
Well, that's just how it goes.

22:45.160 --> 22:46.275
James!

22:47.400 --> 22:49.356
- You must be Mr Hayward?
- Yeah.

22:49.640 --> 22:51.631
Childrers Services
have been in touch about you.

22:51.720 --> 22:52.755
Oh, have they?

22:52.840 --> 22:54.319
Yeah. I'm really glad you popped by, actually.

22:54.400 --> 22:56.516
I'd be really keen for you
to come and have a chat.

22:56.600 --> 22:58.318
All right, well, I'll pop in
when I ain't so busy. Ta.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.878
Yesterday afternoon some of the kids
that were marked down as absent

23:01.960 --> 23:05.191
turned up at the school and smashed
all of the windows in the music block.

23:06.080 --> 23:07.069
Where were you, James?

23:08.280 --> 23:09.952
He was with me all afternoon.

23:11.400 --> 23:12.753
- Really?
- Yeah.

23:13.360 --> 23:15.794
Have you any idea of the cost of the damage?

23:15.880 --> 23:17.836
Look, I just told you,
he was with me all afternoon.

23:17.920 --> 23:19.399
We went to see his nan. She's not well.

23:19.720 --> 23:21.073
My nana's going to heaven.

23:22.680 --> 23:24.591
It's funny, 'cause I'm usually informed
about these things.

23:24.680 --> 23:26.591
He don't like talking about it.
He's been really upset.

23:26.680 --> 23:28.511
Look, whoever smashed your windows,
it werert him.

23:30.760 --> 23:32.193
This is serious, Mr Hayward.

23:33.040 --> 23:34.871
James' behaviour is a real concern.

23:35.120 --> 23:36.951
So I will be expecting that visit.

23:38.400 --> 23:39.719
I'll see you soon.

23:42.600 --> 23:44.033
Right, in you go, trouble.

23:46.280 --> 23:47.633
So you're staying, then?

23:47.720 --> 23:49.153
For the time being, yeah.

23:50.040 --> 23:51.189
Good.

24:29.120 --> 24:30.997
Give me the drugs! Where are the drugs?

24:33.440 --> 24:35.476
Go on, go get yer coat on. T's waiting.

24:37.160 --> 24:38.593
Oi! Where we going?

24:38.680 --> 24:40.989
See a dog about a man. Liven up!

25:05.680 --> 25:06.908
Wait here.

25:16.120 --> 25:17.314
All right, Glen.

25:20.680 --> 25:22.113
I'm not late, am I?

25:24.200 --> 25:26.430
No, I just like to get to sit-downs early.

25:27.400 --> 25:28.719
Right.

25:29.640 --> 25:31.119
So, what's the matter?

25:32.120 --> 25:33.314
Nothing.

25:37.480 --> 25:39.118
Anything the matter with you?

25:40.120 --> 25:41.235
No.

25:43.240 --> 25:44.992
At least, I don't think so.

25:52.560 --> 25:54.710
Okay, you're doing well. Huh?

25:55.560 --> 25:56.629
That's good, innit?

25:58.040 --> 26:00.554
Like to hear that. Success.

26:02.880 --> 26:06.156
But be warned, it can be
a double-edged sword, expansion.

26:06.760 --> 26:09.672
I mean, we like big deals.
Bigger the better. But, uh...

26:12.080 --> 26:13.479
slow and considered, yeah?

26:14.920 --> 26:17.798
'Cause remember, you're not the only
franchise in the area that we're supplying.

26:18.520 --> 26:21.398
And the last thing we want
is a gunfight at the OK Corral.

26:21.480 --> 26:22.754
Understand?

26:22.840 --> 26:24.159
Yeah, of course.

26:26.840 --> 26:28.273
Got it with you now?

26:31.120 --> 26:32.348
Don't be stupid.

26:33.640 --> 26:34.834
Come to you in a couple of days.

26:41.560 --> 26:43.198
He's with you, is he?

26:43.920 --> 26:45.194
Wild Bill?

26:46.600 --> 26:48.033
Yeah, he's just got out.

26:49.120 --> 26:50.792
Thought he might be handy
to have around, you know.

26:50.880 --> 26:52.677
He used to shift a lot of gear back in the day.

26:54.120 --> 26:55.633
Most of it up his own nose.

26:59.600 --> 27:01.716
If he gives you trouble, you let me know.

27:01.800 --> 27:03.074
Who, Bill?

27:03.560 --> 27:04.913
Nah, he's sweet as!

27:05.520 --> 27:06.919
Him and my brother
went way back, didn't they?

27:07.000 --> 27:08.592
There ain't enough room for the pair of ya.

27:10.680 --> 27:12.432
- Right.
- Keep an eye on him, all right?

27:12.520 --> 27:13.589
Yeah.

27:15.320 --> 27:17.550
Be smart and we'll all make a lot of money.

27:25.280 --> 27:27.157
Good money on the rigs, is it?

27:27.240 --> 27:29.037
Yeah, it's supposed to be.
Like, I ain't ruled it out yet.

27:29.120 --> 27:30.712
- Know what I mean?
- Sweet.

27:31.400 --> 27:32.515
When you thinking of going?

27:32.600 --> 27:33.669
Soon as.

27:34.360 --> 27:36.590
Fair play. I've heard it's bang on.

27:37.320 --> 27:39.595
Good food, birds flown out every weekend.

27:39.680 --> 27:40.829
What, on the oil rigs?

27:41.280 --> 27:42.474
Yeah.

27:43.040 --> 27:45.156
You'd be a mug not to go, Bill.

27:48.080 --> 27:50.196
Aie-aie. Here come the other people.

27:56.920 --> 27:58.273
Can we have two cups of tea?

28:05.960 --> 28:07.678
- Hello, Mr Ball.
- Fuck off!

28:07.760 --> 28:09.318
That is charming, that is.

28:10.240 --> 28:11.719
Richard.

28:14.560 --> 28:15.675
Hello, Bill.

28:16.400 --> 28:17.435
All right, Jack!

28:18.000 --> 28:19.353
Enjoy your holidays?

28:19.720 --> 28:22.075
Yeah, it was all right. Food werert all that.

28:23.880 --> 28:25.074
Can I have a word?

28:32.680 --> 28:34.511
Arert you getting a bit old for all this?

28:34.600 --> 28:36.830
It ain't doir me heart any good,
if that's what you mean.

28:36.920 --> 28:38.717
Associating with known criminals.

28:39.000 --> 28:40.115
Straight back in it then, eh?

28:40.200 --> 28:42.509
No, what it was. I was...
I was just walking past the cafe

28:42.600 --> 28:44.192
and I thought I'd pop in
and get a bacon sandwich.

28:44.280 --> 28:45.395
Save it!

28:46.000 --> 28:48.230
Now, I'm gonna let it slide this time.

28:50.600 --> 28:52.511
But I don't wanna see you with them again.

28:53.160 --> 28:54.878
- Thanks, mate.
- I'm not your mate.

28:57.840 --> 28:59.796
Ooh, look, there's your bus.

30:13.280 --> 30:15.589
<i>Excellent.
I think you made the right choice.</i>

30:16.160 --> 30:18.913
<i>Johrs not so sure,
but Helers really positive.</i>

30:20.520 --> 30:21.669
So, have you thought about getting a job?

30:22.320 --> 30:23.878
Yeah, yeah. I'm gonna sign on.

30:25.320 --> 30:28.312
No, get a job, and the sooner the better.

30:29.960 --> 30:33.509
It would go a long way to convincing
Child Services that you're serious.

30:34.400 --> 30:35.549
John can be a bit of a stickler.

30:36.240 --> 30:38.196
Yeah, all right.

30:39.160 --> 30:40.673
It's important, Bill.

30:41.160 --> 30:43.833
It's so easy to fall back into bad habits,

30:43.920 --> 30:45.956
and you know where that leads to.

30:47.080 --> 30:48.354
So...

30:49.560 --> 30:51.630
No associating with known criminals,

30:52.320 --> 30:53.912
no excessive drinking and...

30:54.000 --> 30:55.752
- No drugs.
- Exactly.

30:56.360 --> 30:57.634
It's a big turnaround for you.

30:59.320 --> 31:00.833
You should be proud of yourself.

31:02.400 --> 31:03.674
It's good!

32:53.240 --> 32:55.356
- Go on then, Jim.
- Yeah, watch.

32:55.440 --> 32:57.829
- Ooh!
- Whoa, it's a dive-bomber.

32:59.200 --> 33:01.350
All right, son, watch and learn.

33:01.440 --> 33:03.396
What, 'cause yours
is gonna be any better, is it?

33:03.480 --> 33:05.277
Watch and learn.

33:07.760 --> 33:09.193
Whoa!

33:10.240 --> 33:11.992
How'd you learn how to do that?

33:12.280 --> 33:15.829
That is quality!

33:16.320 --> 33:18.276
That's goir to Stoke Newington, that is.

33:50.720 --> 33:51.869
Yeah, I am!

33:52.720 --> 33:54.756
How did you get yours to go...

33:59.680 --> 34:01.113
You cheeky monkey!

34:08.000 --> 34:10.116
All right. Start again. Right. Ready?

34:10.199 --> 34:11.996
Come round here. Ready?

34:16.239 --> 34:17.672
Come on, I'm dying to go.

34:20.440 --> 34:21.759
You all right?

35:10.680 --> 35:13.194
And I keep saying like,
point blank, like I'm not gonna do it!

35:14.480 --> 35:15.469
Oi, Steph.

35:15.560 --> 35:16.709
- You all right?
- All right, Dean.

35:17.560 --> 35:18.709
Working hard?

35:19.040 --> 35:21.190
No, not really. What you up to?

35:21.280 --> 35:23.510
Going to George's dad's house.
His nan wants to see him.

35:24.280 --> 35:25.395
Right.

35:27.120 --> 35:28.678
That all right, is it?

35:30.320 --> 35:31.912
Yeah, no, that's cool.

35:33.320 --> 35:34.548
Come on, Steph.

35:37.400 --> 35:39.118
If you don't ask, you'll never know.

35:52.560 --> 35:55.677
James Hayward, Craig Boswell,
come here now!

36:11.840 --> 36:13.114
Watch and learn, mate.

36:14.360 --> 36:15.952
Go on. Anyone you want.

36:21.280 --> 36:23.271
All right, listen, pal. Best I can do, right.

36:23.360 --> 36:25.999
Three pound an hour,
give you 20 minutes for lunch.

36:26.400 --> 36:27.435
Right.

36:27.600 --> 36:29.272
Well, it ain't fucking brain surgery, is it?

36:29.360 --> 36:31.032
I mean, do you want the job or not?
I've gotta crack on.

36:32.240 --> 36:33.912
Hang on, one minute.

36:34.360 --> 36:36.555
Hello? Hello, Barry, you all right?

36:36.640 --> 36:39.074
Come on, Arch. Archie. How you been, mate?

36:46.040 --> 36:48.076
I'm gonna sort him out, yeah.

36:48.160 --> 36:49.673
- Sweet.
- Oi, Pill.

36:53.440 --> 36:55.192
Ah, what a'gwan?

36:56.200 --> 36:57.758
Get us some Breezers, geezer.

36:59.440 --> 37:00.555
All right.

37:03.320 --> 37:04.514
Shrapnel?

37:06.800 --> 37:09.792
All right. Then you can
do something for me, innit.

37:11.160 --> 37:13.196
Get him some Breezers, geezer!

37:17.040 --> 37:18.393
- Jimmy, innit?
- Fuck is this?

37:18.760 --> 37:20.159
Yeah, and I'm Boz.

37:22.680 --> 37:23.908
Wanna make some money?

37:25.280 --> 37:26.349
Yeah, course.

37:39.480 --> 37:41.391
Change, boys. Here, watch Pill.

37:41.480 --> 37:43.516
He goes mental when he hears this one.

37:50.600 --> 37:53.239
See there, boys?
That's why you should only sell the drugs.

38:12.800 --> 38:14.518
Give us that here, mate.

38:19.160 --> 38:21.116
Here you are, Jim. Have a go.

38:31.320 --> 38:33.515
Have another go, mate. Go on, take it down.

38:49.160 --> 38:52.357
Oi, little man.
Don't forget to give Pill a call, yeah?

38:52.640 --> 38:54.631
Yeah, course. Sweet, T.

38:54.720 --> 38:56.073
Good lad.

39:09.760 --> 39:10.988
What you been up to?

39:11.400 --> 39:12.594
Nothing.

39:20.080 --> 39:21.354
What's happened to the bog?

39:24.600 --> 39:26.158
Right, come on, grub's up!

39:35.680 --> 39:36.829
What's this?

39:36.920 --> 39:39.559
Shepherd's pie. Made from real shepherds.

39:46.680 --> 39:48.557
It's good. Cheers, Dad.

39:52.040 --> 39:53.758
You all right? How was your day?

39:55.520 --> 39:56.669
There's some food here if you want it.

39:57.360 --> 39:58.634
You playing happy families?

40:06.560 --> 40:07.879
What's up with him?

40:08.320 --> 40:09.389
It's his birthday, innit.

40:09.480 --> 40:10.708
Is it?

40:11.360 --> 40:12.554
Oh, fuck!

40:22.080 --> 40:23.354
Hey, penis boy!

40:23.440 --> 40:25.670
- What?
- The girl you like. She's downstairs.

40:25.760 --> 40:27.716
- Eh?
- She's downstairs. Go. I cover.

40:27.800 --> 40:28.949
- All right, cheers, mate.
- Go.

40:35.720 --> 40:36.709
Hi, Steph.

40:36.800 --> 40:38.358
- Hello.
- You look nice.

40:39.200 --> 40:40.633
I heard your dad's back.

40:41.440 --> 40:42.953
Yeah, well, good news travels fast.

40:43.040 --> 40:45.190
Must be weird. How long was he away for?

40:45.280 --> 40:47.191
Don't know, ages. He's a mug anyway.

40:47.280 --> 40:49.714
Yeah. Dad reckons
he used to be a bit of a nutter.

40:50.240 --> 40:51.992
Yeah, well, runs in the family.

40:54.560 --> 40:56.073
Look, so do you wanna go out Sunday?

40:57.640 --> 41:00.313
Um, Sunday's a bit difficult.

41:01.760 --> 41:02.875
Oh, yeah. Right.

41:03.200 --> 41:04.553
I'll have to leave George with me dad.

41:05.920 --> 41:08.354
Yeah, yeah. No, I suppose not, then.
Doesrt work.

41:10.080 --> 41:12.799
Your hair's getting long.
You should come round and I'll trim it.

41:13.120 --> 41:15.680
Yeah, well, I had to get Jimmy's new uniform,
so it skinted me out.

41:15.760 --> 41:17.796
Of course, Jimmy's
at big school now, isn't he?

41:17.880 --> 41:19.154
Yeah, well, every now and again.

41:19.240 --> 41:21.629
You should come round anyway.
I'll do you a mates' rate.

41:22.560 --> 41:23.879
Yeah, how much is that?

41:23.960 --> 41:25.996
Dunno. You'll have to make me an offer.

41:28.520 --> 41:32.229
Oi! Romeo! Get back to work!

41:32.320 --> 41:33.992
Well, I'll see you then.

41:34.080 --> 41:35.433
You know where to find me.

41:36.000 --> 41:37.149
Yeah, sure.

41:38.200 --> 41:40.350
He wants me to drive over to him for a oner.

41:40.440 --> 41:41.668
I went, "Yeah, I'll drive over, mate. "

41:41.760 --> 41:45.070
"I'll drive over, stick your windows through
and smash the lamp over your face, ya mug. "

41:45.160 --> 41:46.878
Is he takir the piss?

41:56.600 --> 41:58.238
Oh, fuck!

41:59.280 --> 42:02.158
Excuse me, mate, do you know
where there's a shoe sale round here?

42:02.680 --> 42:04.477
- What you doing?
- I'm working.

42:04.920 --> 42:06.558
Is it still called work
when you're not actually moving?

42:07.200 --> 42:08.428
Good money, is it?

42:08.520 --> 42:10.192
Not really, but I enjoy a challenge.

42:10.560 --> 42:12.516
What 'appened? Run out of oil
up north, did they?

42:12.600 --> 42:13.715
Slight change of plan.

42:14.280 --> 42:15.679
You should disappear like we said.

42:17.000 --> 42:18.956
Making people uncomfortable, Bill.

42:19.040 --> 42:20.393
It's bad for business, yeah?

42:22.120 --> 42:23.712
You're seen hanging around,

42:23.800 --> 42:25.472
people are gonna want to open you up.

42:26.600 --> 42:29.910
And I'd hate to see such an old mate
of me brother's get hurt.

42:31.760 --> 42:33.671
I'll be invisible. You won't even see me.

42:34.600 --> 42:35.749
Hardly.

42:36.800 --> 42:38.870
Mate, ain't that your boy?

42:39.160 --> 42:41.196
Oi, Dean! Dean!

42:42.080 --> 42:43.069

42:43.400 --> 42:44.594

42:47.040 --> 42:48.234
I said come on.

42:49.360 --> 42:51.191
- All right, son.
- Have you seen this?

42:52.560 --> 42:54.471
You must be proud as punch, boy!

42:54.560 --> 42:56.471
What's your dad do? He's a boxer.

42:56.560 --> 42:58.391
What's your dad do? He's an astronaut.

42:58.480 --> 42:59.799
What's your dad do?

42:59.880 --> 43:01.279
He's a fuckir signpost!

43:02.200 --> 43:03.872
Have a word, what you reckon, Dickie?

43:03.960 --> 43:05.473
I couldn't do it.

43:07.440 --> 43:09.590
I expect to see you gone
by the end of the week.

43:13.600 --> 43:14.669
Come on.

43:15.040 --> 43:16.473
Get on the matching smothers, Dean!

43:22.560 --> 43:23.754
See you at home.

43:34.920 --> 43:38.356
Bicarbonate of soda.
What's this, then?

43:41.320 --> 43:42.799
Hello, again!

43:44.160 --> 43:45.354
Bill, innit?

43:45.440 --> 43:47.351
Do you remember me

43:47.440 --> 43:48.555
Yeah.

43:49.920 --> 43:51.831
I was your welcome-home present.

43:53.240 --> 43:54.912
Oh, sorry, I didn't, um...

43:55.000 --> 43:56.911

43:59.880 --> 44:01.074

44:02.080 --> 44:03.195
You know.

44:03.960 --> 44:05.359
Don't you remember?

44:06.240 --> 44:07.832
Five times, at least.

44:07.920 --> 44:09.638
You were like a barn door in a hurricane.

44:09.720 --> 44:10.789
Yeah?

44:11.040 --> 44:14.237
No, I'm only joking!

44:15.040 --> 44:16.712
You didn't have a pulse most of the evening.

44:16.800 --> 44:18.279
Sorry.

44:19.120 --> 44:20.189
It's all right.

44:20.680 --> 44:22.477
I'll keep it on t'slate for you if you like.

44:22.560 --> 44:23.709
Yeah?

44:23.800 --> 44:25.313
Are you on the game, then?

44:25.400 --> 44:27.595
Blimey, you know all the lines, don't ya!

44:30.160 --> 44:32.549
Oi, do you know anything about baking?

44:32.640 --> 44:34.039

Sixteen?

44:39.880 --> 44:41.598
And you're baking him a cake!

44:43.040 --> 44:45.076
Well, yeah... I mean, that was the plan.

44:45.160 --> 44:49.039
I'm sure
he'll be blown away by it.

44:50.080 --> 44:52.275
Are you getting him an Action Man ar all?

44:55.160 --> 44:56.798

44:58.520 --> 45:02.718
Oh, look, I don't mean

45:02.800 --> 45:04.870
Your little boy's gone, me darling.

45:04.960 --> 45:06.712
He's a man now. Excuse.

45:15.200 --> 45:17.191

- Nothing.

45:17.600 --> 45:18.715
I'm waiting.

45:23.000 --> 45:24.797

- Nothing.

45:25.440 --> 45:28.000
Yeah, well, you can wait

45:38.400 --> 45:40.072
I've got a surprise for you.

45:40.160 --> 45:42.720
What? Quit work after just one day?
Brilliant surprise.

45:42.800 --> 45:44.950
No, I felt bad about missing your birthday.

45:45.920 --> 45:46.875
Which one?

45:48.240 --> 45:49.195
I got you a little present.

45:50.440 --> 45:52.192
- Oh, yeah?

45:52.760 --> 45:55.752
Uh, not you. Here y'are, that's yours there.

46:18.760 --> 46:20.034
Who's that?

46:20.600 --> 46:22.909
She's a friend.
She's got Dears present for him.

46:23.000 --> 46:23.955
Oh, yeah?

46:28.720 --> 46:30.631
Your dad said it's your birthday.

46:31.960 --> 46:32.915
It was.

46:33.000 --> 46:34.069
Well, guess what?

46:37.280 --> 46:38.235
It still is!

46:38.480 --> 46:39.708
- What are they doing?
- Nothing.

46:39.800 --> 46:41.028
Get your coat, we're going for a walk.

46:41.120 --> 46:42.758
Oh, no! I wanna know what they're doing!

46:42.840 --> 46:44.034
Exactly, that's why we're going for a walk.

46:44.120 --> 46:45.712
Grab your coat, bring your doughnut.

46:47.200 --> 46:48.952
Get her out! I want her out now!

46:49.960 --> 46:51.279
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's the problem?

46:51.360 --> 46:52.998
Are you mad or something?
You brought a brass back

46:53.080 --> 46:55.036
to have sex with me in me own mum's bed!

46:56.360 --> 46:57.952
Well, they were all out of Action Man!

47:02.280 --> 47:03.554
I want her out.

47:05.760 --> 47:07.716
Hello, Dean. Is this a bad time?

47:08.160 --> 47:12.119
That's very good, Mr Hayward.
Wow, I wish my kitchen was that clean.

47:12.200 --> 47:14.668
Yeah... Er, it's the bathroom.

47:14.960 --> 47:16.632
Yeah, I can see that.

47:18.400 --> 47:20.630
Yeah, Jimmy's room.
Had a little tidy up in there.

47:20.760 --> 47:23.069
- The toilet's looking nice, Mr Hayward.
- Yeah, yeah.

47:23.400 --> 47:25.834
Toilet. Yeah. Call me Bill.

47:25.920 --> 47:27.876
Yeah, no, er, John will be really pleased.

Oh, good, yeah.
Well, send him my regards, won't ya?

Yeah. Um, can I...?

47:34.520 --> 47:38.308

- Yeah, I know. Can I take a look?

47:39.800 --> 47:42.030
Well, I don't mind, but he,
he might be a bit uncomfortable with it.

47:42.120 --> 47:44.554
You know what teenage boys are like.

47:49.840 --> 47:52.274
Right, well, I'II... I'll save that for next time.

47:53.560 --> 47:56.120
Come and say bye to Helen. She's off now.

47:56.440 --> 47:58.590
I'm really pleased, Bill. Big improvement.

47:58.760 --> 48:00.637
Well, good. Well, pop by any time.

48:05.880 --> 48:09.668
- Um, what were you arguing about?
- Arguing?

48:09.760 --> 48:12.752
Yeah, when I arrived. Those raised voices?
What was it about?

48:14.760 --> 48:18.230
Oh, that, yeah.
Dean didn't really like his birthday present.

48:18.920 --> 48:21.673
- Oh, no. What was that?
- An old bike.

48:28.000 --> 48:30.195
- Crack it open then, Pill.
- See that lump. Has that gone through?

48:30.280 --> 48:31.508
Ahh, yeah!

48:32.280 --> 48:35.113
- I can smell that already. Proper.
- Yeah.

48:35.200 --> 48:36.553
Making me need a pony!

48:38.880 --> 48:40.757
- There, that's a proper shine. Look.
- There, look at that.

48:42.720 --> 48:45.871
- Is that you, Rox?
- Yeah.

48:47.240 --> 48:50.232
- About fucking time.
- I got the baking soda.

48:54.040 --> 48:55.632
Jesus, how much is that?

48:55.800 --> 48:57.836
This, my angel, is one brick.

48:58.840 --> 49:00.273
Share the taste!

49:00.880 --> 49:02.598
This is my mortgage, darlir!

49:02.680 --> 49:05.717
You wouldn't ask a bank manager
if he had any money he didn't want.

49:06.200 --> 49:09.397
Don't stand there gawping, babe!
Put a pan on, let's cook this shit up!

49:09.800 --> 49:11.233
Too right, mate!

49:17.440 --> 49:19.158
This one's bubbling.

50:29.400 --> 50:30.355
Dirty bitch.

50:44.920 --> 50:47.070
- Lovely, mate.
- There you go.

50:50.760 --> 50:52.159
- All right?
- Ta, ta. All the best.

50:53.720 --> 50:55.472
That's a nice little piece.

50:57.880 --> 50:59.791
Good afternoon, Mr Hayward.

51:09.520 --> 51:10.475
For fuck's sake.

51:13.880 --> 51:16.474
- Stay here, yeah?
- Oi, Boswell. Come 'ere.

51:19.160 --> 51:20.832
- What are you doing?
- I ain't doing nuffir, bruv.

51:20.920 --> 51:22.831
- What did you stop me for?
- Past your bedtime, innit?

51:23.240 --> 51:25.390
- Who's your mate?
- He's no one, mate. It's just a mug, innit.

51:25.480 --> 51:27.550
How's about I take you down the station,
search the pair of ya?

51:27.640 --> 51:28.550
What would I find?

51:28.640 --> 51:30.596
You won't find nothing, mate.
We ain't got nothing on us.

51:30.680 --> 51:33.638
I know what you're like, Boswell.
If you're out, you're up to no good, ain't ya?

51:33.720 --> 51:34.755
Not necessarily.

51:34.840 --> 51:36.432
What can you tell me about some trainers?

51:36.520 --> 51:38.317
- What trainers?
- You tell me.

51:38.400 --> 51:40.356
I don't know fuck all about any trainers.

51:40.440 --> 51:42.431
- Don't ya?
- Nah, mate. Stop pissing about.

51:42.520 --> 51:43.953
What did you really pull me over for?

51:44.040 --> 51:45.678
Stop me having a nice evening,
know what I mean?

51:45.760 --> 51:48.638
- Why don't you go home, hey?
- Why don't you piss off back to the nick?

51:48.720 --> 51:50.836
You need to watch your mouth.

52:21.200 --> 52:23.270
- You owe me!
- I'm sorry.

52:24.960 --> 52:26.598
- I'm sorry.
- Shut up!

52:35.960 --> 52:37.598
T! Please!

52:37.680 --> 52:39.636
Come on, leave him alone, T.

52:40.360 --> 52:42.794
T, I didn't...

52:44.040 --> 52:44.995
Please!

52:52.200 --> 52:53.997
- T!
- You gonna run to your dad?

53:06.680 --> 53:07.874
Thanks, mate.

53:21.600 --> 53:23.591
You really hurt that lad before, you know, T.

53:24.240 --> 53:26.356
Yeah, it's a jungle out there.

53:26.640 --> 53:29.029
He's a little sweetie,
you shouldn't have him like that.

53:29.120 --> 53:30.997
Oh, no, I should've wrote him
a little letter or something.

53:31.080 --> 53:32.638
Oh, come off it, how old is he? What 10, 11?

53:32.720 --> 53:35.109
I don't give a shit how old he is!

53:35.200 --> 53:38.556
He works for me.
We're trying to make money, like a business.

53:38.640 --> 53:41.473
You're not really grasping
this whole sort of situation are you, girl?

53:41.560 --> 53:42.959
How it works and that?

53:43.040 --> 53:44.871
You don't just give out loads of gear
and loads of money

53:44.960 --> 53:48.111
and let them run off into the hills,
and go, "Oh, well, never mind, eh?"

53:48.200 --> 53:50.191
Well, why are you working
with a 10-year-old anyway?

53:50.280 --> 53:53.238
Erm, let's think. Maybe 'cause
the Old Bill can't nick 'em!

53:53.320 --> 53:55.754
- I don't wanna listen to it off ya!
- It's got nothing to do with me, T.

53:55.840 --> 53:57.512
I'm talking about the kid.
Will you leave me alone?

53:57.600 --> 53:59.511
- Your coaching him in brass!
- Fuck off!

54:00.320 --> 54:01.275
Ooh!

54:01.800 --> 54:03.756
Don't tell me to fuck off!

54:08.160 --> 54:10.151
- 'Ere, where you going?
- Nowhere.

54:10.240 --> 54:11.912
- Can I go?
- No, go home.

54:12.000 --> 54:13.672
- Oh, go on!
- No, Jim, do one, seriously.

54:13.760 --> 54:15.079
Dean, please.

54:16.960 --> 54:20.396
Mate, I'm going to Steph's.
I'll see you later though, yeah?

54:20.840 --> 54:22.478
Go inside, it's cold.

54:31.560 --> 54:32.993
Cheers, mate. Say hello to Pete for me, yeah?

54:33.080 --> 54:35.071
Will do. See you in a couple of weeks, hun.

54:36.480 --> 54:38.038
Should I have booked?

54:38.120 --> 54:40.156
Nah, you're all right. Come in.

54:51.200 --> 54:52.918
I'm gonna wash your hair.

54:53.280 --> 54:55.271
- Yeah?
- Yep. Get your top off.

55:16.560 --> 55:18.755
Sorry, Bill, can I come in for a minute?

55:19.080 --> 55:20.035
Yeah, course.

55:21.200 --> 55:22.189
It's funny, hair.

55:22.280 --> 55:23.679
Every day you look in the mirror,
you look the same,

55:23.760 --> 55:26.115
but leave it long enough, one day
you can hardly recognise yourself.

55:26.200 --> 55:28.316
Yeah, is that right?

55:29.120 --> 55:31.156
I don't know about right, but I reckon so.

55:31.240 --> 55:34.232
Yeah? So you're a hairdresser
and a philosopher, then?

55:34.320 --> 55:37.039
No, mainly a philosopher.
Hairdressing is just a sideline.

55:44.800 --> 55:45.755
Terry do that?

55:46.440 --> 55:47.919
And that Dickie.

55:49.400 --> 55:52.472
They've been cooking up rocks
and smoking pipes for two days.

55:52.560 --> 55:54.551
- Sounds like fun.
- Evil fuckers!

55:55.560 --> 55:57.437
- Do you need a place to crash?
- Would that be all right?

55:57.520 --> 56:00.398
- I know what he's like. He'll come lookir.
- Yeah, it's all right.

56:00.480 --> 56:02.516
- Let 'em blow themselves out.
- Thanks.

56:03.400 --> 56:05.834
- You sure that's all right?
- Yeah. It's fine.

56:05.920 --> 56:08.753
- Do you want a cup of tea?
- Two sugars.

57:26.720 --> 57:27.835
Steph!

57:29.360 --> 57:31.112
I missed the train.

57:31.880 --> 57:33.108
I just...

57:37.120 --> 57:38.599
I don't know where me hat is.

57:42.240 --> 57:44.276
Don't know
what I'm fucking doing.

57:54.240 --> 57:55.195
What are you doing?

58:02.560 --> 58:06.519
Steph. I'm hungry.

58:07.560 --> 58:10.028
- You all right?
- Yeah. No.

58:10.400 --> 58:11.674
Don't worry about Dad.

58:11.760 --> 58:13.830
- Steph!
- Yeah, okay. I gotta go.

58:14.480 --> 58:17.552
- Meet me tomorrow at the cafe?
- Yeah. 11:00?

58:18.200 --> 58:21.192
- Right. See ya.
- See ya.

58:33.760 --> 58:35.079
What's this?

58:35.920 --> 58:37.751
It's all I could get.

58:38.680 --> 58:40.796
You're a chip off the old block, ain't ya?

58:41.400 --> 58:44.392
Right, you'll see Pill tomorrow
and you'll hold for him.

58:45.160 --> 58:46.752
I can't. I'm going...

58:46.840 --> 58:49.274
I don't give a fuck.

58:50.160 --> 58:52.390
You'll work off what you owe

58:52.480 --> 58:55.392
or I'll come round your drum
and burn you and your whole family

58:55.480 --> 58:58.870
while you're sleeping, yeah? Sound fair?

58:59.520 --> 59:01.272
Now piss off!

59:04.000 --> 59:07.037
And you, you mug. What you looking at?
Go on.

59:10.840 --> 59:12.831
- That's Bill's kid, isn't it?
- So?

59:12.920 --> 59:14.239
We'll bury 'im.

59:14.360 --> 59:16.555
What's your favourite?

59:16.640 --> 59:21.430
<i>Er... Is it Dollar? Their classic album.</i>

59:22.280 --> 59:24.077
- You all right?
- What's she doing here?

59:24.720 --> 59:26.153
She just needs to stay here
for a couple of days.

59:26.240 --> 59:28.071
- Are you all right with that?
- No.

59:28.160 --> 59:29.718
- Dean.
- What? I gave you my answer.

59:29.800 --> 59:31.518
If you're not going to listen, don't ask.

59:31.600 --> 59:33.318
- She's in trouble, mate.
- Yeah. And?

59:33.400 --> 59:35.356
All right. It's all right, Bill.

59:35.640 --> 59:38.518
I'll see if Stacy'll let me stay at hers.

59:38.600 --> 59:40.556
T won't think of looking there straight off.

59:41.320 --> 59:42.992
All right. Sorry, Rox.

59:43.880 --> 59:47.759
Oi, hang on.
You can stay the night tonight if you want.

59:48.800 --> 59:49.755
You sure?

59:49.840 --> 59:51.910
- Yeah, I said so, didn't I?
- Ta, mate.

59:53.640 --> 59:57.030
...and I never liked them
because they were always too runny or grey.

59:58.760 --> 01:00:00.318
You all right, son?

01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:05.476
Cup of tea there.

01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:07.995
Ooh, very smart. Where you going? Court?

01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:10.710
- Fuck off!
- Do you want some eggs?

01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:12.392
I'm all right, thanks.

01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:16.389
Oi! Jimmy! Where you off to?

01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:30.675
- Oi, Dean!
- Oi...

01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:32.796
- Where's my money?
- What money?

01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:34.679
You come into my house
and you steal from us?

01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:36.716
Who the fuck do you think you are?

01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:38.074
Hang on, what you on about?
I ain't stole nuffing!

01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:41.436
- Don't lie!
- Steph, I'm not lying to ya, honestly!

01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:42.919
Who did, then?

01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:45.073
I dunno! Your old man?

01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:48.914
Unbelievable! Just because your old mars
a thief, doesn't mean mine is!

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.638
Oi, this is bollocks.
You need to get your facts straight.

01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:52.517
I'd never do that to ya!

01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:54.955
Stay away from me. You're all the same.

01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:57.600
You, your thieving dad
and your low-life brother.

01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:00.632
- Steph!
- Fuck off!

01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:21.351
Jimmy! Oi, Jimmy.

01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:23.396
He's not here. Is everything all right?

01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:26.313
- No, it's not.
- Why? What's he done?

01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:29.236
I think he stole money off of Steph.

01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:30.875
Oh.

01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:33.912
I'm having a cup of tea. Do you want one?

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:35.797
Look, just, just leave me alone, yeah?

01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:38.394
Dean... I know what it's like.

01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:40.717
I left home when I were 15, so...

01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:42.472
Look, I worked my bollocks off
to look after him.

01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:45.233
I know. And Jimmy can be
a little shit sometimes, but...

01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:47.436
Yeah, and now I've got
some old slag living in my house,

01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:49.511
who thinks she can play mum to me.

01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:50.999
I'm not trying to play mum.

01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:54.152
- I'm trying to help.
- And I didn't run away from home, all right.

01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:56.117
Home ran away from me,
and now Bill's come back...

01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:57.713
Your dad's a good man.

01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:01.076
If you've got a problem, you can
talk to me about it. Problem shared...

01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:03.598
Everyone's a philosopher, irt they?

01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:05.989
What and let me guess,
cocksucking's just a sideline, is it?

01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:41.113
You all right, Rox?
You got a face as long as a kite.

01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:44.670
- Jimmy's nicked money from Steph.
- What?

01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:48.671
I should've told you before.

01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:50.671
- He owes T money.
- Jimmy does?

01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:54.035
- Got 'im workir.
- You what?

01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:05.877
I have a formal agreement I need you to sign.

01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:08.235
- All right.
- Providing you adhere to the terms...

01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:11.392
Well, 'old on a second.
What exactly is this?

01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:13.033
A residence order.

01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:17.477
Well, we feel it's in the boys' best interests
that they remain in your care.

01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:19.512
- Really?
- Absolutely!

01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:21.751
This is, er, a good thing, right?

01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:25.078
Yeah. It's great.

01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:28.279
You sign here.

01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:32.879
- Just there, yeah?
- Yeah, just there and also on here.

01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:38.112
"William Hayward, the father,

01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:42.836
- "agrees to m... m...
- Maintain.

01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:46.111
"... maintain, lodge, clo...

01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:48.834
- Clothe.
- "... clothe and educate... "

01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:56.919
You can leave now.

01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:04.795
Yeah?

01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:07.909
Yeah. Go on, then.

01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:21.910
Right. Come on, Roxy.
Let's go and find my Jimmy.

01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:49.239
That's him.

01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:52.632
- The one on the left?
- Yeah.

01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:56.039
There he is.

01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:01.954
You all right?

01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:03.678
- Where's Jimmy?
- All right, Wild Bill!

01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:05.388
- What the...
- Do you want some?

01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:08.392
No, you fucking don't, so fuck off.

01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:09.549
No need to be hostile!

01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:11.710
Don't make me ask you again!
Where's my son?

01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:14.393
All right, blood.

01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:21.033
Oi! You! Jimmy. Come 'ere!

01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:25.113
- Oh, fuck, T's gonna go spare.
- Right, listen to me, right?

01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:26.958
My son don't work for you no more.
Do you understand me?

01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:28.075
- Yeah, all right.
- Yeah?

01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:29.673
T'll have something to say about that.

01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:32.911
If he don't like it, remind him
what happened to his brother.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:36.072
Jimmy owes money.
Can't just go running away.

01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:37.832
Listen to me, right.

01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:41.310
If I see you or your muggy little pals
anywhere near my son again,

01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:43.197
I'm going to come looking for you first,

01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:45.953
and I'm gonna cut your head off
with a bread knife.

01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:50.270
Prick! And you, fuck off!

01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:53.597
- He's fucking nuts.
- Where the fuck were you, man!

01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:55.830
Take it easy, bruv.

01:06:15.320 --> 01:06:16.799
Oi! Don't you run again!

01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:19.394
Sit down! Sit your arse down!

01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:35.872
How'd you find me?

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:40.549
Anywhere you are, don't you think
I was hiding there 20 years ago?

01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:42.989
It was Boz's idea.

01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:44.832
Yeah, you can't hide behind that neither!

01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:49.712
What's in 'ere, then?
Better be your homework.

01:06:55.560 --> 01:06:57.835
That's a lot of crack for such a young man.

01:06:59.720 --> 01:07:03.395
Well, you're doing well, irt ya?
First year's the 'ardest.

01:07:04.440 --> 01:07:07.716
- What?
- Yeah, that's what they say.

01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:09.836
First year's the 'ardest.

01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:12.470
It werert for me.
Second year, that was the real killer.

01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:14.437
First year, you can still remember the world.

01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:17.678
Your home. Your pals, Sunday roast.

01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:20.479
What it's like to take a dump
without someone watchir ya!

01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:24.917
The second year,
that's when the hope starts to leave ya.

01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:27.075
No one left to trust.

01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:29.628
No one you really like 'cause you're in prison,
everyone's a criminal.

01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:31.551
They all want to fuck you over.

01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:33.358
You don't wanna go to sleep,
'cause whatever you got

01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:36.591
will be nicked by the lag
you share your cell with.

01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:41.513
Whose farts and stink
you have to put up with,

01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:45.399
24 hours a day, seven days a week.

01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:48.911
Don't wanna make friends with no one,

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.230
because if you do,
you make an enemy somewhere else.

01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:56.398
Nonces, who wanna 'ump ya. Oh, yeah.

01:07:57.400 --> 01:08:00.278
Bods who don't think nuffir
about creeping up behind ya with a shank

01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:02.510
and sticking it in yer throat.

01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:06.960
Do you know what the worse thing is?

01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:09.873
Do ya? You get used to it.

01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:18.599
So, Jimbo, what are you gonna do?

01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:20.272
What d'you mean?

01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:23.997
You got a big problem. What you gonna do?

01:08:25.439 --> 01:08:27.237
I dunno. I thought...

01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:32.273
- I dunno.
- It's a choice.

01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:35.438
You might think you're only young,
but you ain't.

01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:38.193
You're a man in my eyes
and you've got to make a choice.

01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:41.511
Are you sure you wanna run around
with these muppets?

01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:43.511
Carrying on with all this caper?

01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:47.277
You're gonna end up where I've just been.
Is that what you want?

01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:51.555
No. I just wanna go home.

01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:00.752
Do you want me to help you sort this out?

01:09:05.439 --> 01:09:08.796
Okay. But you gotta understand
there's a price.

01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:13.636
If you ever do this again,

01:09:15.359 --> 01:09:19.035
it's over between me and you.
Do you understand me?

01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:24.551
Give me the bag of bones.

01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:41.513
- Bill.
- Adam.

01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:46.191
- You all right?
- I'll have to swerve that one.

01:09:46.279 --> 01:09:48.919
- Yeah, course.
- Is Steph there, mate?

01:09:52.359 --> 01:09:54.191
She's not in any trouble, is she?

01:09:54.279 --> 01:09:57.113
Nah, mate, nah. I just need
a quick word with her, that's all.

01:09:58.120 --> 01:09:59.439
Steph!

01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:03.993
- Oh, piss off!
- Hold on!

01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:06.116
We got your money. Come on.

01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:11.754
Steph, I kinda nicked yer money.

01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:15.276
- You kinda nicked it?
- I nicked yer money.

01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:17.792
- And?
- And I'm sorry.

01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:22.959
Right. Listen, if it's short
let me know and I'll give you the rest.

01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:24.309
You took this?

01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:27.119
He's had a few problems,
but we're sorting them out.

01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:28.189
Don't hold it against him.

01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:30.919
It's my fault, really.
If anyone's to blame, it's me.

01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:33.949
- How's Dean?
- Yeah, he's all right.

01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:37.718
I just hope he don't murder his little brother.

01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:40.872
- Does he hate me now?
- Oh, yeah. With a passion!

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:47.149
You come here, now!

01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:49.549
Drop it out, will ya, Dean?
It's all sorted, okay?

01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:51.631
- Yeah, not till I batter him, it's not.
- Oi!

01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:54.109
- Just let it go, Dean, please.
- Yeah, but Steph hates me now.

01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:57.954
No, she don't. And if she does,
it's something you'll just have to work out.

01:10:58.440 --> 01:11:01.716
- Well, I ain't gonna forget this.
- Nobody ever does.

01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:04.753
Right, I'll get that.

01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:18.515
'Ere y'are, look what I just found.

01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:23.120
- Hiya.
- What d'you want?

01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:26.359
Right, why don't you two have a chat?

01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:28.271
- We'll go and get some Chinese. Come on.
- Really?

01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:29.793
Yeah, come on.

01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:33.158
- Thanks, Bill.
- That's all right.

01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:39.437
He's all right, your dad.

01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:44.194
Yeah. Yeah, I suppose he is.

01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:54.754
Come here. I'm sorry.

01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:15.394
- Are you Mad Bill?
- Who's asking?

01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:18.998
- You're in deep shit.
- Oh, yeah?

01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:21.833
T says the Callaghans', tomorrow at 1:00.

01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:24.309
Be there. Don't make him come looking.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.116
- Is that it?
- I'll tell him I saw ya.

01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:30.229
You do that. Go on, run along, little man.

01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:32.197
Suck my dick, batty boy!

01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:36.271
What are you lookir at?

01:12:37.480 --> 01:12:39.710
- What did he want?
- Shooting.

01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:43.429
- All set? Come on, then.
- Aye.

01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:47.356
Yeah, tomorrow before 1:00.

01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:50.309
Good. What about Russ?

01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:54.832
Yeah, well, find out and let me know, yeah?
All right, later on.

01:12:56.200 --> 01:12:58.668
- How many's that?
- Plenty.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:03.231
- Since when was "plenty" a number?
- Six.

01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:08.759
Not enough. Call Barry.

01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:10.993
<i>Here we go.
That's it.</i>

01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:12.274
<i>Who's first?
- Right.</i>

01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:13.713
Take a pancake and you fill it with that.

01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:16.109
- Do you know how to use them? Hey!
- Hey!

01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:18.112
It didn't really work, but...

01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:20.555
You haven't put
any plum sauce on yer thing yet.

01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:24.918
- I made juice.
- So we're eating real duck?

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.560
- Is that my drink?
- There's another one here.

01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:29.198
Is that my drink?

01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:34.631
- That's proper nice.
- Yeah.

01:14:15.080 --> 01:14:17.071
Come on, lights out now, Jim.

01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:19.870
- Fucking hell.
- Oi! Language!

01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:24.996
- Night, son.
- Night, Dad.

01:14:27.960 --> 01:14:29.871
Well, hurry up, then!

01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:34.112
- You all right?
- Yeah.

01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:39.592
- Do you want anything?
- No, I'm good.

01:14:57.840 --> 01:15:00.434
So, what you gonna do?

01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:03.955
Give him his gear
and tell him to leave Jimmy alone.

01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:08.350
Right. Think that will work?

01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:12.796
We'll have to see, won't we?

01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:17.479
They've called in the firm
and they'll all be tooled up.

01:15:19.400 --> 01:15:20.549
Cheers.

01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:26.159
Watch out for Dickie. He's a nutter. Fearless.

01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:29.312
And Pill carries a pepper spray
and a blade.

01:15:38.360 --> 01:15:39.679
There he is.

01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:52.720
- Yo, yo.
- You all right?

01:16:24.120 --> 01:16:25.269
Bill...

01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:28.838
- You all right?
- Yep.

01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:33.713
Come to bed.

01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:22.077
- Where's Dad?
- Er...

01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:25.914
He's had to pop out. Do you want some food?

01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:28.920
Er... Yeah.

01:17:32.680 --> 01:17:34.272
Do you know how to make flapjacks?

01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:52.993
Is he here yet?

01:17:53.800 --> 01:17:54.949
Yeah, he's under the table.

01:18:32.360 --> 01:18:33.952
What you having, lads?

01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:41.674
- Whoa, blood.
- Don't talk black to me, man. Play the game.

01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:20.990
I'll have a coke please, Keith.

01:19:21.640 --> 01:19:24.632
'Ere you are. Yours, I believe?

01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:27.396
I was just about to come looking for you.

01:19:27.480 --> 01:19:30.074
- Why? Am I late?
- No, just don't like ya.

01:19:33.360 --> 01:19:35.430
- It's all there.
- It wants to be!

01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:39.518
Can't just go around giving people digs.

01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:43.354
Fair enough. I just wanna sort
this Jimmy business out.

01:19:43.800 --> 01:19:46.917
Keeps doing one
through the long grass, blood!

01:19:48.160 --> 01:19:50.355
- He's a kid.
- He's a cunt.

01:19:54.480 --> 01:19:57.438
Look, you got your money, you got your gear.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.434
Just drop me son out of it now, yeah?
He's retired.

01:20:00.520 --> 01:20:04.593
- All right?
- Sure. He's as good as dead to me.

01:20:11.320 --> 01:20:13.038
So it's sorted, yeah?

01:20:15.680 --> 01:20:19.036
Go and drink yer pop, Billy. You're boring me.

01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:22.959
Nah, I'll leave it, if that's all right with you.

01:20:23.040 --> 01:20:24.632
No, mate. Finish it.

01:20:42.480 --> 01:20:46.234
He's a lot like you, your boy.
A fucking liability.

01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:49.237
We're better off without him. I mean,

01:20:49.320 --> 01:20:52.153
it's not as if he's the only kid
we've got running round for us.

01:20:53.520 --> 01:20:54.839
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

01:20:55.800 --> 01:20:57.677
How the mighty have fallen, hey?

01:20:57.760 --> 01:21:01.070
Wild Bill, my arse!
It's more like Mild Bill, innit?

01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:04.316
What makes you think
I'd listen to you anyway?

01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:08.279
Like you're somebody. You come in 'ere,

01:21:08.360 --> 01:21:10.828
throwing your weight about
like you're the big "I am",

01:21:10.920 --> 01:21:15.277
and you're nothing. You're nobody.
You are a fucking joke.

01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:18.790
Telling me what I can and can't do.

01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:23.113
Fuck that! This is my manor.

01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:26.469
What? I can't make moves?

01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:31.270
I can't do a bit of graft without some fucking
used-to-be putting up a red light?

01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:33.911
Does Bertha still live here, Keith?

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.389
Mate, I'm connected.

01:21:37.480 --> 01:21:39.710
You remember Glen, don't ya, Bill?

01:21:40.200 --> 01:21:42.634
He smacked yer arse
last time you got out of hand.

01:21:43.200 --> 01:21:45.236
I think I'll go change a barrel.

01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:49.994
Your boy's retired, yeah?
Mate, he ain't even started.

Oh! Riddles. I like these.

01:25:39.240 --> 01:25:40.639
I mean I ain't setting up.

01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:44.033
No, but you're waging a one-man war
against my monkeys, aren't ya?

01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:45.997
- They was using kids.
- So what?

01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:48.348
Everyone in the borough's

01:25:48.440 --> 01:25:50.351

and I'll be all, like,

01:25:50.440 --> 01:25:53.000
<i>you know, c'est la vie!
Which of course I ain't!</i>

01:25:53.080 --> 01:25:55.958

01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:12.355
Apple never falls far
from the tree, does it, eh?

01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:17.153
You. You're all out of credit, all right?

01:26:17.240 --> 01:26:18.389
That's the last I want

01:26:18.480 --> 01:26:20.630
to hear anything about you having
done eight years for anyone,

01:26:20.720 --> 01:26:23.109

01:26:23.200 --> 01:26:26.590
in this fucking stadium
as a fucking permanent fixture.

01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:29.671

01:26:29.840 --> 01:26:31.034
Oh, good!

Good to see yer again, Glen.

01:26:41.040 --> 01:26:42.792
Cunt! Little Bill.

01:26:52.360 --> 01:26:55.955
- I thought they were gonna kill us.
- Yeah, so did I, mate. So did I.

01:26:58.960 --> 01:27:01.633
- You all right?
- Think I've got a splinter.

01:27:25.760 --> 01:27:29.036
- What's going on, Dad?
- They ain't selling ice creams.

01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:34.794
Stay still! Stay still!
Don't move. You're nicked!

01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:37.348

01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:38.873
Wait! What am I supposed to have done?

01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:40.916
Oh, be fair. Have a look at yourself!
Get in the car!

01:27:43.600 --> 01:27:44.635

01:27:51.280 --> 01:27:52.554
Oh, my God!

01:27:53.200 --> 01:27:55.475
I still don't know
what I'm supposed to have done.

01:27:55.560 --> 01:27:57.915
He was at me nars. I swear! She's not well.

01:27:58.000 --> 01:27:59.319

Everyone's a grass nowadays, Bill,

Yeah, well, you know where we are.
