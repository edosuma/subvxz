On the last episode
of <i> Ink Master,</i>

00:04.337 --> 00:08.090
14 masters and apprentices
were battling it out

00:08.173 --> 00:10.635
to prove they're the best.

00:10.719 --> 00:12.887
In the flash challenge,

00:12.971 --> 00:15.014
naked models
lit up the competition.

00:15.098 --> 00:17.308
I haven't seen a wiener
in a minute.

00:17.392 --> 00:18.935
I'm stoked.

{\an5}(Craig)
I'm back on the team
with the enemy again.

00:20.270 --> 00:23.440
Winning this skull pick
is way more important

00:23.523 --> 00:24.858
than any kind of revenge.

00:24.941 --> 00:26.109
Plan of attack here.

00:26.192 --> 00:27.485
Pipe down, Marisa.

00:27.569 --> 00:30.155
I was airbrushing when you were
still [bleep] in your diapers.

00:30.238 --> 00:31.156
Let's hit the lights.

00:33.199 --> 00:34.409
(Oliver)
Performance theater here.

00:34.492 --> 00:37.954
A real moving functioning snake,
it's very commendable, man.

00:38.037 --> 00:40.206
{\an5}(Craig)
The strategy is to look
at people's strengths

00:40.290 --> 00:41.958
and weaknesses
to take out someone.

00:42.041 --> 00:44.294
{\an1}St. Marq, that cocky fool,
I want to see that guy

00:44.377 --> 00:45.670
{\an1}freakin' be knocked down
a level.

00:45.754 --> 00:46.838
I'm gonna show people
how this game is played.

00:46.921 --> 00:49.758
(announcer)
In the elimination tattoo,

00:49.841 --> 00:53.011
Craig proved he's here
to play the game.

00:53.094 --> 00:54.345
What do you want to get?

00:54.429 --> 00:57.140
We gotta turn their bodies
into an interactive tattoo.

00:57.223 --> 00:59.642
{\an3}Can I get a rainforest
incorporating my butt crack?

00:59.726 --> 01:00.560
{\an3}Can I get a wolf mouth
in my armpit?

01:00.643 --> 01:01.728
That's ridiculous.

01:01.811 --> 01:03.980
Our goal
with this skull pick

01:04.063 --> 01:07.150
is to put everyone
out of their comfort zone.

01:09.110 --> 01:11.237

01:13.490 --> 01:15.283
- Ow.
- Ow, ow, ow.

01:15.366 --> 01:16.451
Can I get medical,
please?

01:16.534 --> 01:18.620
My canvas is passed out
in my chair.

am I supposed to do,

01:22.916 --> 01:24.501
Are you serious?

01:24.584 --> 01:26.127
(announcer)
In the elimination,

01:26.211 --> 01:31.174
Katie, Kruseman, Erik, and Earl
were the bottom four.

01:31.257 --> 01:32.509
(Dave)
Katie.

01:32.592 --> 01:33.343
{\an5}(Oliver)
You could've had
a lot cooler tongue in there

01:33.426 --> 01:35.053
and made this thing
even better.

01:35.136 --> 01:36.721
(Dave)
Kruseman.

01:36.805 --> 01:38.473
{\an5}(Kruseman)
She wanted her hair becoming
the pinup girl's hair,

01:38.556 --> 01:40.642
and I just think that
that's a ridiculous idea.

01:40.725 --> 01:41.851
{\an1}If you're playing it,
play it,

01:41.935 --> 01:44.604
{\an1}or make it easier on everybody
and throw in the towel.

01:44.687 --> 01:45.939

Erik.

01:46.022 --> 01:47.607
The stylistic choice
to put all that black

01:47.690 --> 01:49.484
on that girl's foot
does not make any sense.

01:49.567 --> 01:51.778
(Dave)
Earl.

01:51.861 --> 01:54.364
This is by far the most
unattractive tattoo of the day.

01:54.447 --> 01:55.782
As detailed
as I could get it.

01:55.865 --> 01:57.700
You say it's detailed,
but it's hard to tell

01:57.784 --> 01:58.868

what it takes to be Ink Master.

Over 3,000 years ago,

04:58.965 --> 05:03.720
native Japanese artists engraved
small clay humanlike figures

with designs that mirrored
ancient tattoos.

{\an8}Chris Nuñez specializes
in Japanese style tattooing,

05:10.685 --> 05:12.061

rip my [bleep] apart.

and your time
starts now.

05:29.662 --> 05:31.914
{\an8}(Chris)
Outlining is definitely
the first thing that you learn

05:31.998 --> 05:34.167
{\an8}in your apprenticeship
once you pick up a machine.

05:34.250 --> 05:35.752
It's the structure.
It's the frame.

05:35.835 --> 05:38.254
It's the thing that you build
off, so it has to be perfect.

So far in this competition,

a plan going into this?

05:47.013 --> 05:49.140
{\an3}I actually do have a plan
going into this.

05:49.223 --> 05:50.600
It's to do clean lines.

05:50.683 --> 05:51.434
The challenge is line work,
and that's

05:51.517 --> 05:53.436
exactly what
I'm gonna give 'em.

05:53.519 --> 05:56.064
I'm gonna hook this thing up
with a bamboo bodysuit,

05:56.147 --> 05:57.482
nothing but straight lines.

05:57.565 --> 05:59.192
My bamboozle.

05:59.275 --> 06:01.861
{\an8}I definitely feel like there's
a lot more people in here

06:01.944 --> 06:03.696
{\an8}that don't use
a lot of outline.

06:03.780 --> 06:06.074
I see a shift
in who's at the top right now.

06:06.157 --> 06:07.408
St. Marq would
tell you that,

06:07.492 --> 06:10.453
"I am a world-renowned
outliner."

06:10.536 --> 06:12.538
But St. Marq has a lot
of difficulty showing lines,

06:12.622 --> 06:15.416
'cause I haven't seen any
since he's been here.

06:15.500 --> 06:17.752
(Oliver)
This is right along the lines

06:17.835 --> 06:20.129
of almost every other tattoo
we've seen you do.

06:20.213 --> 06:21.297
{\an1}We get it--
you're great at this smooth,

06:21.380 --> 06:23.508
{\an1}black-and-gray,
no outline thing.

06:23.591 --> 06:26.511
{\an1}That one trick isn't gonna
take it to the end.

{\an5}(St. Marq)
My competitors are very
intimidated by my craftsmanship.

06:30.098 --> 06:32.475
{\an8}Maybe this is a self-esteem
problem that they have.

that's excelling past them.

{\an8}He sure is arrogant for somebody
who's not been in the top.

06:43.945 --> 06:46.405
Maybe St. Marq wants
everybody to hate him.

06:46.489 --> 06:49.117
Two hours left.

People I grew up with, friends,
got caught up in gangs,

07:05.758 --> 07:06.926
and, like,
I come from nothing.

07:07.009 --> 07:09.011
Tattoo saved me.

07:09.095 --> 07:10.930
I'm in it to win it,
point blank.

07:13.641 --> 07:16.185
{\an3}Yeah, I was--
I had got started before you.

07:16.269 --> 07:18.020
{\an8}I've never worked
with clay before,

07:18.104 --> 07:20.481
{\an8}and it seems like my line work
is not coming out

07:20.565 --> 07:21.524
{\an8}as smooth as I want it
to come out.

07:21.607 --> 07:24.193
{\an1}What I did was--
'cause it was, like, all rough,

07:24.277 --> 07:25.486
{\an1}so I came back and added
a little water to smooth it out.

07:25.570 --> 07:27.363

with time on this one.

what we thought you'd do,

07:41.586 --> 07:42.670
very little lines.

07:42.753 --> 07:44.881
You literally only sculpted
10% of your Dogu.

Erik, let's start
with you.

07:55.183 --> 07:57.894
{\an5}(Oliver)
I love the folding fabric
of the robe that comes down

07:57.977 --> 07:58.728
and how you cut away
some of the depth

07:58.811 --> 08:00.771
to give
that overlapping look.

08:00.855 --> 08:01.606
The technical application
of the lines

08:01.689 --> 08:03.441
could have been
a little cleaner.

08:03.524 --> 08:05.610
{\an3}Using a bigger tool is
definitely the way to go,

08:05.693 --> 08:07.862
just so you clean out
all that excess clay.

08:07.945 --> 08:10.198
{\an5}(Oliver)
Even more cutaway could've
added even more depth

08:10.281 --> 08:13.451
to those folds, but that's
my favorite part for sure.

08:13.534 --> 08:14.911
(Dave)
Marisa.

08:14.994 --> 08:17.496
{\an5}(Chris)
Overall, the layout's nice.
The cutouts are strong.

08:17.580 --> 08:19.123
The mandala worked
in your favor.

08:19.207 --> 08:21.500
You have some nice
smaller details to it.

08:21.584 --> 08:22.960
Good job.

08:23.044 --> 08:23.878
(Dave)
Matt.

08:23.961 --> 08:26.047
You did
some exceptional work here.

08:26.130 --> 08:28.591
Different line weights,
different depths, symmetry,

08:28.674 --> 08:30.176
and really nice detail.

08:30.259 --> 08:31.552
Certainly in the back of it,
when I'm looking

08:31.636 --> 08:33.596
at these little lines
and little ornaments

08:33.679 --> 08:35.722
that are hanging on the arms
that are done

08:35.806 --> 08:38.601
within the same design,
it's super nice.

08:41.938 --> 08:43.313
{\an5}(Oliver)
I love the intricacy
of the line work

08:43.397 --> 08:44.815
throughout the whole body
of this thing.

08:44.899 --> 08:47.568
The little cross and swords
that are on the top of the hat,

08:47.652 --> 08:49.028
they're insanely detailed.

08:49.111 --> 08:50.363
I think that's where

08:50.446 --> 08:52.365
the really small stuff.

08:52.448 --> 08:53.282

Chris.

08:53.366 --> 08:54.575
This thing looks super tough.

08:54.659 --> 08:57.328
I love how close to perfection
you attempted to get it.

08:57.411 --> 08:59.497
Symmetrically,
the shapes fit both sides.

08:59.580 --> 09:00.706
(Chris)
You knocked it out of the park.

(Dave)
St. Marq.

09:02.959 --> 09:04.335
(Oliver)
I like the deep cutaway parts.

09:04.418 --> 09:05.670
I think it does
give it depth.

09:05.753 --> 09:08.714
It does give it strength.
Very minimal use of lines.

09:08.798 --> 09:10.466
I wish the two spirals
on the chest

09:10.549 --> 09:11.801
were a little bit
more symmetrical.

09:11.884 --> 09:16.889
{\an8}I cannot stand how much
St. Marq hates on line work.

09:16.973 --> 09:18.808

reminiscent of your tattooing.

09:21.227 --> 09:23.604
It's strong line weights.

09:23.688 --> 09:26.023
Everything is very sharp
when it comes to your outlines.

I like the depth,
cutting out the clay,

09:32.113 --> 09:33.948
give it some strength
and weight to it.

09:34.031 --> 09:36.450
The lines on the ends
of the arms and the legs

09:36.534 --> 09:38.369
seem pretty rapidly
scratched in.

I'm having a hard time
with how light the flowers are.

09:44.583 --> 09:46.544
They're really hard to read
from any sort of distance.

09:46.627 --> 09:49.255
What's missing here is
really hard cut-in angles

09:49.338 --> 09:50.881
just to give 'em
the craftsmanship

09:50.965 --> 09:53.676
and the finished look
of getting a clean line.

09:53.759 --> 09:54.844

Duffy.

09:54.927 --> 09:56.429
One of the things I like
about your design,

09:56.512 --> 09:58.931
they don't always have to be
straight lines to be effective,

09:59.015 --> 10:03.060
and the depths of your lines are
very deliberate and symmetrical,

10:03.144 --> 10:06.022
so it really gives this thing
a standout look from a distance.

10:06.105 --> 10:07.356
Kruseman.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.692
(Chris)
Great use of the space.

10:09.775 --> 10:12.153
I like the way that you used
the tools for different effects.

10:12.236 --> 10:13.529
And overall,
the craftsmanship is very strong

10:13.612 --> 10:15.906
because of the depths,
the cutouts,

10:15.990 --> 10:16.907
the different line weights.

10:16.991 --> 10:17.950
It's a really strong piece.

to cut out of this thing

as clean and crisp as it is,
it's very sharp,

of dynamic shadowing

10:40.514 --> 10:42.391
If you would have varied
your line weights a little bit

10:42.475 --> 10:45.353
to make the images stronger
so that it's not all the same,

10:45.436 --> 10:47.188
then it wouldn't be
as camouflage.

Definitely Chris.

11:06.749 --> 11:09.585
The attention to detail
inside the big cutouts

11:09.668 --> 11:10.836
took a lot of work.

17:28.172 --> 17:29.465
Big Ceeze.

17:29.548 --> 17:32.009
{\an8}My canvas wants
his koi fish in color.

17:32.092 --> 17:35.971
I am a black-and-gray artist.
This is gonna suck.

17:36.054 --> 17:37.264
Matt.

17:37.347 --> 17:39.558
Duffy.

17:39.641 --> 17:40.225
Dave.

17:46.148 --> 17:47.441
Kito.

17:47.524 --> 17:49.818
{\an8}Damn.
I know I'm in trouble.

17:51.612 --> 17:52.362
Marisa.

17:52.446 --> 17:54.573
Kruseman.

17:54.656 --> 17:55.532
St. Marq.

17:55.616 --> 17:57.826
{\an8}Chris thinks that
I can't do color tattoos.

17:57.910 --> 18:00.412
Bull[bleep].
I'm gonna crush it.

18:00.496 --> 18:03.123
Katie.

18:03.207 --> 18:04.958
Erik.

18:05.042 --> 18:06.210
Tyler.

18:06.293 --> 18:07.127
Hi.

18:08.420 --> 18:10.631
{\an3}Remember, guys,
after the elimination tattoo,

18:10.714 --> 18:12.800
{\an3}the human canvas jury
will vote on the tattoo

18:12.883 --> 18:14.843
{\an3}that they think
is the worst

18:14.927 --> 18:16.845
and put one artist
up for elimination.

18:16.929 --> 18:20.224
You'll have six hours
to tattoo a koi fish,

18:20.307 --> 18:23.477
{\an3}and based on your work,
one of you will close shop.

18:23.560 --> 18:25.354
(both)
Whew.

18:25.437 --> 18:26.980
Good luck to you.

18:27.064 --> 18:27.606
You guys ready or what?
Thank you, sir.

18:27.689 --> 18:29.817
Make me proud.

18:29.900 --> 18:32.611
{\an8}Japanese style tattooing
is near and dear to my heart.

18:32.694 --> 18:34.696
{\an3}It's gonna be
pretty traditional Japanese.

18:34.780 --> 18:37.241
Everything about a koi fish
is line work.

18:37.324 --> 18:40.702
In the scales, in the fins,
line work makes it all

18:40.786 --> 18:42.079
work together as one.

18:42.162 --> 18:44.373
{\an1}Line work's not anything
that I'm scared about.

18:44.456 --> 18:45.207
{\an3}Confidence,
that's important.

18:47.626 --> 18:49.878
{\an1}When you don't do things
traditionally, then--

18:49.962 --> 18:52.464
{\an3}You might get
crucified for it.

18:52.548 --> 18:54.049
{\an1}I definitely
don't want water.

18:54.132 --> 18:55.092
At all, period?

18:55.175 --> 18:56.176
{\an1}Yeah. No.

18:56.260 --> 18:59.972
{\an1}I want him to blossom
out of flowers, not...water.

19:00.055 --> 19:03.767
{\an8}My canvas is not only picky
but lacks common sense.

19:03.851 --> 19:04.852
{\an3}Why don't you like
the water?

19:04.935 --> 19:06.562
Just looks cheesy.

19:06.645 --> 19:07.604
- It looks cheesy?
- Yeah.

19:07.688 --> 19:09.064
{\an1}It's not moving
in my body.

19:09.147 --> 19:10.315
Koi fish are in water.

19:10.399 --> 19:14.194
You don't see koi fish tattoos
without water.

19:14.278 --> 19:15.028
{\an3}So there's no way I can
talk you into adding some water?

19:15.112 --> 19:16.071
- Just a little bit?
- Yeah, no.

19:16.154 --> 19:18.448
(Kito)
We can't get no understanding.

19:18.532 --> 19:20.784
I feel like I'm talking
to a toddler.

19:20.868 --> 19:21.827
But what if I draw it on here
and just let you take a look

19:21.910 --> 19:24.037
and see if you might like it?

19:24.121 --> 19:26.999
You can if you want to,
but I don't want water.

19:27.082 --> 19:29.835
I don't know how to handle
this [bleep].

19:38.969 --> 19:40.304
{\an3}This is a line work challenge,
and all the tattoos

19:40.387 --> 19:41.763
{\an3}that I've done here,
they've been really stoked

19:41.847 --> 19:43.265
on my line work.

19:43.348 --> 19:45.100
{\an1}How are you feeling?
You about ready to get tatted?

19:45.183 --> 19:49.021
{\an3}No, I'm not ready.
I'm so freaking out.

19:49.104 --> 19:50.188
{\an1}Why?

19:50.272 --> 19:52.107
'Cause it's a tattoo
and it's gonna hurt.

19:52.190 --> 19:53.233
It's a needle.

19:53.317 --> 19:55.819
Damn, she want this on her ribs.
Can she take it?

19:55.903 --> 19:56.862
{\an1}How are you gonna do
the water wave?

19:56.945 --> 19:58.614
{\an3}You say you want it
coming from the outside

19:58.697 --> 19:59.656
going into the fish?

19:59.740 --> 20:00.949
Well, somewhat.

20:01.033 --> 20:04.870
Everything that she prefers is
against what I'm trying to do.

20:04.953 --> 20:06.330
{\an3}That fish is bigger
than what we--

20:06.413 --> 20:06.788
{\an1}No, see,
this is the original size.

20:06.872 --> 20:08.498
I'ma shrink it.

20:08.582 --> 20:10.751
Can he have one whisker?

20:10.834 --> 20:12.961
{\an8}Right now, mentally,
I'm losing it.

20:14.463 --> 20:18.592
{\an3}Artists, you have six hours
to tattoo a koi fish

20:18.675 --> 20:21.136
{\an3}as good
as Mike Rubendall's,

20:21.219 --> 20:24.640
{\an3}and your time...begins...
now.

20:24.723 --> 20:26.767
Ah, here we go.

20:26.850 --> 20:28.060
All right,
get that leg ready.

20:28.143 --> 20:30.103
{\an5}(Oliver)
Today with the koi fish,
it's all on one.

20:30.187 --> 20:33.023
{\an8}Everybody's doing
the same koi fish.

20:33.106 --> 20:34.399
{\an3}Yes.

20:34.483 --> 20:37.152
Everybody's going head-to-head,
even Mike Rubendall.

20:41.073 --> 20:42.950
{\an8}Starting out of the gate,
it's considered to be

20:43.033 --> 20:44.076
{\an8}a level playing field,

20:44.159 --> 20:45.243
{\an8}but there's so many tricks
into scaling,

20:45.327 --> 20:48.205
{\an8}really understanding
the dynamics of the body

20:48.288 --> 20:51.333
{\an8}and the flow of the fins,
they still are gonna be lost.

20:51.416 --> 20:52.417
{\an3}All right,
you ready for this?

20:53.919 --> 20:56.630
{\an3}I'm gonna angle it
with your existing tattoo.

20:58.423 --> 20:59.466
{\an9}What are you thinking?
What are you--

21:01.927 --> 21:02.844
{\an8}Are you kidding me?

21:02.928 --> 21:04.179
I drew this koi fish

21:04.262 --> 21:07.349
specifically
for the original placement

21:07.432 --> 21:08.600
that we had talked about.

21:08.684 --> 21:09.685
My two cents,
as far as placement

21:09.768 --> 21:12.312
and how it's gonna look,
I think you're right on

21:12.396 --> 21:14.731
putting it in the middle,
just so much of a better fit.

21:14.815 --> 21:15.941
{\an5}(Matt voice-over)
I'm gonna help Katie
any way I can

21:16.024 --> 21:18.860
so that we can continue on
in this competitor together.

21:18.944 --> 21:20.946
{\an8}Later on down the line,
I'm eventually gonna

21:21.029 --> 21:24.032
{\an8}"dispatch" of Katie,
just not today.

21:24.116 --> 21:26.535
{\an3}Would you want to do something
more like that?

21:28.245 --> 21:31.039
Thank God Matt is there.
He's got my back.

21:31.123 --> 21:33.834
On the outside, I'm still
trying to charm my canvas,

21:33.917 --> 21:36.586
but on the inside,
I'm definitely choking him.

21:38.088 --> 21:39.756
{\an3}I'll let you
take a look at it.

21:39.840 --> 21:40.298
You like where it's at?

21:42.092 --> 21:43.885
He just looks
lonely there.

21:43.969 --> 21:45.971
I'm exhausted.

21:46.054 --> 21:48.056
She's having me change this
and change that.

21:48.140 --> 21:49.057
That's good?

21:49.141 --> 21:50.559
{\an1}It's right on the blade
though.

21:50.642 --> 21:53.729
{\an3}You got your other
shoulder blade tattooed already.

21:53.812 --> 21:55.564
At home,
I own my own shop.

21:55.647 --> 21:58.400
If I don't want to do it,
I send 'em on their way.

21:58.483 --> 22:00.527
{\an3}You relaxed?
Let your shoulders down.

22:00.610 --> 22:03.321
I got my back against the wall,
and I'm having to compromise.

22:03.405 --> 22:05.657
{\an1}Now, I feel like I just have
a hole in the back.

22:05.741 --> 22:08.035
{\an3}A hole?

22:08.118 --> 22:09.411
{\an3}All right, take a look
at that.

22:11.496 --> 22:13.206
Yeah, perfect.

22:13.290 --> 22:14.458
{\an3}Let's get it popping,
girl.

22:16.293 --> 22:17.419
{\an1}I compromised.
I did good, right?

22:17.502 --> 22:18.587
{\an3}Yeah.

22:18.670 --> 22:22.007
{\an8}My canvas has given me
a headache from the get-go.

22:22.090 --> 22:24.217
Luckily for me, she compromised
to let me do outlines.

22:24.301 --> 22:27.346
Mine's half the size
of everybody else's,

22:27.429 --> 22:30.891
{\an3}but I'm gonna have contrast
and good, clean lines.

22:30.974 --> 22:32.267
(Dave C voice-over)
Is that enough to keep me safe?

22:32.350 --> 22:33.518
I don't know,

22:33.602 --> 22:35.479
but I don't want to be
anywhere near the bottom.

22:39.649 --> 22:43.236
{\an8}There are so many stretch marks
and cellulite

22:43.320 --> 22:46.531
{\an8}that I am scared to death
to have to put this tattoo here.

22:51.161 --> 22:52.996
{\an8}Yeah, no, you should be
an expert at that now.

22:53.080 --> 22:54.664
[scoffs]
[bleep] my life.

22:56.124 --> 22:58.627
Oh, my God,
oh, my God.

23:00.504 --> 23:01.838
{\an1}I'm gonna do a flower
in color.

23:01.922 --> 23:03.423
{\an8}Being in this competition,
there's a lot of pressure.

23:03.507 --> 23:07.469
Sometimes I question
if I am built for this.

23:07.552 --> 23:09.304
{\an1}Oh, my God.
I'm pressed for time right now.

23:09.387 --> 23:10.806
(Big Ceeze voice-over)
Growing up, it was hard.

23:10.889 --> 23:15.227
Because of the way I was raised,
my kids mean everything to me,

23:15.310 --> 23:17.104
and I'm here
in this competition

23:17.187 --> 23:19.147
because I want
to give them more.

23:19.231 --> 23:21.108
{\an3}Can't believe you go
from a stencil to this, like--

23:21.191 --> 23:22.317
{\an1}[chuckles]

23:24.069 --> 23:26.363
{\an7}Oh, my God, stop, stop, stop,
stop, stop, s--

23:26.446 --> 23:27.447
{\an9}Bam.

23:32.119 --> 23:34.913
We ain't got a whole lot
of time, so I gotta get on it.

23:34.996 --> 23:37.999
{\an3}Oh, my God.
My poor back.

23:38.083 --> 23:39.292
I'm not happy with it.

23:39.376 --> 23:42.462
{\an3}It looks like pee,
like the fish is peeing.

23:42.546 --> 23:43.672
What kind of [bleep] is that?

23:43.755 --> 23:44.840
(Kito)
This bitch is crazy.

23:44.923 --> 23:46.258
Like, I can't figure out
how please her.

23:46.341 --> 23:47.551
{\an1}You're telling me that
that doesn't look

23:47.634 --> 23:48.677
like a puddle right now?

23:48.760 --> 23:49.928
It's a water splash.

23:50.011 --> 23:51.179
{\an1}Looks like my niece
drew it.

23:51.263 --> 23:52.556
Don't insult me, man.

23:52.639 --> 23:53.723
I have to live with this,

23:53.807 --> 23:55.475
{\an1}and you're not paying
for my removal.

23:55.559 --> 23:57.018
I'ma fix it.

23:57.102 --> 23:58.395
{\an5}(Kito voice-over)
I made it this far,
and I've been having

23:58.478 --> 24:01.773
all these nutty-ass canvases
all this time.

24:01.857 --> 24:03.525
She's by far the worst.

24:03.608 --> 24:05.193
Two hours to go.

24:05.277 --> 24:06.695
{\an1}Okay, turn.
I'm gonna start on the back.

24:06.778 --> 24:10.323
{\an3}Rubendall is taller than I am,
and he's twice as big.

24:10.407 --> 24:12.367
{\an5}(St. Marq)
Chris should have me
in his sights.

24:12.450 --> 24:14.703
{\an8}I am the top dog
in this competition.

24:14.786 --> 24:16.163
{\an1}Okay, back the other way
a little bit for me.

24:16.246 --> 24:17.914
I gotta hurry,
get this color.

24:17.998 --> 24:19.291
(St. Marq voice-over)
He is lucky that this is not

24:19.374 --> 24:20.375
a head-to-head
with me directly.

24:20.458 --> 24:22.419
It would have been
a slaughter.

24:22.502 --> 24:23.587
It's pretty [bleep] epic.

24:27.507 --> 24:28.592
Take a look at that.

24:28.675 --> 24:33.263
{\an1}This is BS right now.
Like, I'm [bleep] pissed.

24:34.097 --> 24:36.516
He's too orange though.

24:36.600 --> 24:38.518
That's the blood leaking
through the yellow.

24:39.936 --> 24:41.897
{\an1}You and I are not even
on the same page right now.

24:41.980 --> 24:44.566
{\an3}Ain't nobody ever been unpleased
with something I did

24:44.649 --> 24:45.525
{\an3}ever in my whole life
till now.

24:45.609 --> 24:47.527
(Kito voice-over)
This is plain ignorance.

24:47.611 --> 24:50.113
{\an1}That [bleep] looks
like a pumpkin and piss.

24:50.197 --> 24:52.365
{\an3}Look, I told you,
your skin irritated, so the--

24:52.449 --> 24:54.075
{\an1}I'm trying to be nice,
and I'm just gonna [bleep]

24:54.159 --> 24:55.744
flip your table over.

24:55.827 --> 24:57.078
This [bleep] is on my back.

24:57.162 --> 24:59.998
{\an1}I'm trying to, like, talk to you
so we can work together.

25:00.081 --> 25:01.541
{\an3}Well, I do know this,
if you guys want to try

25:01.625 --> 25:03.168
{\an3}to finish this tattoo,
you need--

25:03.251 --> 25:04.878
She told me to stop.
I was trying to say,

25:04.961 --> 25:05.670
at least let me finish
what I started.

25:05.754 --> 25:07.672
{\an1}Your job is to work
with me here.

25:07.756 --> 25:10.634
{\an1}He's gonna make me [bleep]
flip out, you know what I mean?

25:10.717 --> 25:11.676
You gonna have him continue,
or you gonna have him stop?

25:15.055 --> 25:17.682
I want to continue.

25:18.934 --> 25:19.601
You guys work it out.

25:19.684 --> 25:21.186
(Kito)
This is embarrassing.

25:21.269 --> 25:22.437
I don't want to go home
for this.

25:22.520 --> 25:23.605
I cannot let this
defeat me.

25:27.525 --> 25:33.657
(Dave)
Five, four, three, two, one.

25:33.740 --> 25:36.743
That's it. Time's up.
No more ink.

25:36.826 --> 25:37.077
It's amazing.

25:37.160 --> 25:38.620
{\an3}Yeah?

25:38.703 --> 25:40.080
{\an1}I love it.
The color looks awesome.

25:40.163 --> 25:41.122
{\an1}Great job.

25:41.206 --> 25:42.624
{\an8}My plan of knocking out
the black-and-gray guys,

25:42.707 --> 25:45.752
{\an8}perfectly planned out
and perfectly executed.

25:45.835 --> 25:48.213
Big Ceeze,
look at that busted blue flower.

25:48.296 --> 25:49.339
You cannot color saturate.

25:49.422 --> 25:51.591
St. Marq, all you had to do
was do good line work,

26:03.895 --> 26:04.980

on my tattoo--

26:05.063 --> 26:06.606
{\an3}Everyone's gonna see you
make an excuse.

26:06.690 --> 26:08.400

be a dickhead.

in the drawing?

26:10.568 --> 26:12.654

26:12.737 --> 26:14.406
People that had problems
with their canvases

26:14.489 --> 26:17.242
are because
the drawings sucked.

26:23.581 --> 26:25.959
Honestly, it doesn't look good
for Kito right now, man.

26:26.042 --> 26:27.252
It really doesn't.

26:27.335 --> 26:29.838
{\an3}I don't think his design was
super solid to start with.

26:29.921 --> 26:30.839
Well, it wasn't.

26:30.922 --> 26:32.173
{\an1}I mean, did you see
that water that he did?

26:32.257 --> 26:35.427
He just pulled it out of his ass
is what it kind of seemed like.

26:35.510 --> 26:38.638
So when Kito was having so much
trouble, what were you doing?

26:38.722 --> 26:41.057
{\an4}(Big Ceeze)
I mean, all I can think about
was myself at the time.

26:41.141 --> 26:42.851

gonna bang out this tattoo.

26:42.934 --> 26:46.604
{\an5}(Katie)
I can't even tell that Big Ceeze
wants Kito to be here.

26:46.688 --> 26:49.274
My canvas was difficult too,
and Matt tried to help me.

26:49.357 --> 26:52.152

he'll ask me for it.

{\an1}My design is a traditional

The line work is

let's start with you.

27:44.496 --> 27:45.288
{\an1}I really like the contrast
in this tattoo.

27:45.372 --> 27:46.664
Your line work was strong.

27:46.748 --> 27:49.667
{\an1}I like the heavy black spine
you did on the koi.

27:49.751 --> 27:51.753
One of the big things
on this tattoo

27:51.836 --> 27:54.214
is that all the water
is crashing in.

27:54.297 --> 27:55.590
It's very rigid
and stiff.

27:55.673 --> 27:57.675
{\an8}If you look at Mike's
multi-directions of the water,

27:57.759 --> 27:59.594
{\an8}it gives it
that dynamic feel,

27:59.677 --> 28:01.679
{\an8}and that is something
that I think you're missing.

How did you feel going up
against Mike on this challenge?

28:09.521 --> 28:11.773
My heart is still racing.
It's [bleep] nerve-racking.

28:11.856 --> 28:15.318
It's technically very smooth,
very soft, very bright,

28:15.402 --> 28:18.780
and very uninteresting.

28:18.863 --> 28:20.782
{\an1}In regards to your water,
it's very straight,

28:20.865 --> 28:22.659
in a line, uniform.

28:22.742 --> 28:24.953
{\an1}With this particular tattoo,
you did the bare minimum.

It's a line work challenge,

"Keep it simple."

28:40.343 --> 28:42.011
That background is
too overpowering.

28:42.095 --> 28:43.304
It kind of dwarfs the fish.

28:43.388 --> 28:44.806
{\an1}If you would've kept
the background the same

28:44.889 --> 28:45.932
and enlarged the koi fish,

28:46.015 --> 28:47.016
{\an1}it would've had a nicer look,
nicer appeal.

28:47.100 --> 28:49.144
Today was the day to have
that liner in full swing,

28:49.227 --> 28:51.146

that you could

28:52.730 --> 28:54.482
get away with not outlining
as possible.

I definitely think
my line work is on point.

28:56.818 --> 28:58.653
It's on point because
only half of it's there.

The big question is,
above the flower,

29:17.255 --> 29:18.882
the black bubbles--
what exactly is that?

29:18.965 --> 29:19.924
I was going for clouds.

29:20.008 --> 29:22.343
Just dark, black clouds
underneath water?

29:22.427 --> 29:23.678
I don't even know
if they're clouds.

29:23.761 --> 29:26.222
{\an3}I don't specialize in Japanese,
so I'm not gonna do it well

29:26.306 --> 29:26.973

you know what I mean?

29:33.646 --> 29:35.148
Big Ceeze,
you're now telling me

29:35.231 --> 29:36.357
that you're not gonna do
that well,

29:36.441 --> 29:37.609
you're not gonna
do this well,

29:37.692 --> 29:40.028
so Ink Master is not
the title suited for you.

{\an1}I know you had a struggle,
but, man,

29:49.245 --> 29:52.081
{\an1}every centimeter of this tattoo
shows that struggle.

29:52.165 --> 29:53.541
{\an1}This line work is
piss-poor.

29:54.626 --> 29:57.253
{\an3}Every stroke on that tattoo,
she was moving.

{\an1}The drawing is one of the worst
layouts of the day.

29:58.796 --> 30:00.757
{\an1}The shape of the water,
totally strange.

looks like an artichoke.

to this tattoo whatsoever.

30:09.599 --> 30:11.392

30:12.602 --> 30:14.854
{\an1}You showed great contrast
between the hot and cold colors.

30:14.938 --> 30:18.107
{\an1}It's applied very technical.
It's very readable.

30:18.191 --> 30:19.901
{\an1}You could see this tattoo
from the freeway,

30:19.984 --> 30:21.486
{\an1}and I think
that's super important

30:21.569 --> 30:22.946
{\an1}when it comes to traditional
Japanese tattooing.

30:23.029 --> 30:26.574
{\an8}I think the similarity
between Rubendall's tattoo

30:26.658 --> 30:29.327
{\an8}and your tattoo is
both fish really stand out.

30:29.410 --> 30:31.454
It's a beautiful tattoo, man.
Great job.

30:32.372 --> 30:34.207
Marisa.

30:35.542 --> 30:37.085
Your true test of line work

30:37.168 --> 30:38.586
falls into the consistency
of the scales.

30:38.670 --> 30:41.464
Look at the randomness
of pattern

30:41.548 --> 30:43.174
and just getting the color

30:43.258 --> 30:45.134
consistently
up to the skin grade,

30:45.218 --> 30:47.845
the scallop to the scallop
should be perfect.

extremely strong.

31:18.042 --> 31:20.420
{\an1}Just the contrast is
killing me.

31:20.503 --> 31:23.006
{\an1}The gray value in the fish
is the same gray value

31:23.089 --> 31:24.090
as the background.

31:24.173 --> 31:26.259
{\an8}Rubendall's fish
really stands prominent.

31:26.342 --> 31:28.011
{\an8}If you're gonna do
a fish this black,

31:28.094 --> 31:29.929
{\an8}the water should have been
a lot lighter.

31:33.099 --> 31:34.225
Craig.

31:34.309 --> 31:37.687
{\an1}Craig, this tattoo didn't
strike me as a Japanese tattoo.

31:37.770 --> 31:40.523
{\an1}It leaned more
towards fantasy like.

31:40.607 --> 31:43.067
I get the sense of koi
flying in blue clouds.

31:43.151 --> 31:44.902
{\an3}I honestly toned back
my new school.

31:44.986 --> 31:48.156
{\an1}It's definitely technically
clean, line work is good,

31:48.239 --> 31:49.907
{\an1}but tattoos should create
some emotion

31:49.991 --> 31:50.867
when you look at them.

31:50.950 --> 31:53.036

of this design.

31:58.750 --> 31:59.834

a lot of strong outlines

31:59.917 --> 32:02.086
and a lot of contrast
in the black.

32:02.170 --> 32:04.797
Where the water's light
versus where the water's black,

32:04.881 --> 32:05.965
it's not just random.

32:06.049 --> 32:08.635
It appears to have
very artistic eye behind it.

a really strong outing today.

32:13.264 --> 32:15.933

- For sure.

a back piece, essentially.

{\an1}The center of the lotuses
aren't complete,

with the magenta,

32:27.445 --> 32:28.529

underneath it--

It has definitive veins in it.

achieved solid line work.

{\an8}If I could put Erik's color
with Matt's aesthetic

33:36.222 --> 33:40.768
{\an8}and Kruseman's water,
it would be one standup tattoo.

33:40.852 --> 33:42.729
I'm leaning more
towards Matt's tattoo.

33:42.812 --> 33:44.897
It has
the more Japanese aesthetic.
