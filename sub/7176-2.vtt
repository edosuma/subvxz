01:50.861 --> 01:52.361
You're not eating.

01:52.863 --> 01:54.030
I know.

01:54.823 --> 01:56.365
I'm not hungry.

01:57.201 --> 01:59.535
For the first time
in your life.

02:02.289 --> 02:04.832
There's a first time
for everything.

02:05.584 --> 02:07.919
Here. These will help.

02:09.338 --> 02:10.671
Thank you.

02:13.842 --> 02:16.302
May Freya lie
with you tonight,

02:16.386 --> 02:18.721
and take care of you,
my friend.

02:34.905 --> 02:37.448
I am so happy
that my uncle is dead.

02:38.575 --> 02:40.743
But I still don't
believe it.

02:41.495 --> 02:43.246
You saw him killed.

02:44.331 --> 02:45.414
Yes.

02:46.708 --> 02:47.917
Yes, I did.

02:48.001 --> 02:49.502
But now...

02:49.586 --> 02:52.463
Now I want his head!

02:53.548 --> 02:55.925
I want his head,
I need his head.

02:56.468 --> 02:58.261
And then I will believe it.

02:59.638 --> 03:00.805
Floki.

03:18.282 --> 03:20.283
Why do you hate
your uncle so much?

03:22.869 --> 03:25.705
Do you think that
my older brother
was the only member

03:25.789 --> 03:28.749
of my family who raped me
when I was a child?

03:29.418 --> 03:31.836
It was my uncle
who first brought him to me.

03:32.379 --> 03:34.880
Since I was six years old,
he abused me.

03:34.965 --> 03:37.717
He violated my body
and my soul.

03:37.801 --> 03:40.594
And he told me
not to resist the attentions
of the many men

03:40.679 --> 03:44.307
that he brought to me,
saying that they all
wanted the pleasure...

03:45.642 --> 03:49.061
They all wanted the pleasure
of sleeping with a child.

03:49.646 --> 03:53.274
And the last was my brother,
who shared me with my uncle.

03:54.401 --> 03:57.445
And even when I cried
and I said that
they were hurting me,

03:57.529 --> 03:59.155
they didn't stop.

04:00.991 --> 04:02.742
They never stopped.

04:35.150 --> 04:36.734
Give this to me.

05:23.073 --> 05:26.075
It was good today.
I enjoyed fighting.

05:26.910 --> 05:29.286
You fought well today,
I watched.

05:30.414 --> 05:32.540
But you took too many risks.

05:32.999 --> 05:36.293
You jumped into battle,
you did not stay by my side.

05:36.628 --> 05:39.630
Don't do that, Porunn.
You have much to learn.

05:40.090 --> 05:42.842
Do you suddenly
not believe in our gods?

05:43.427 --> 05:45.469
Do you not believe in fate?

05:46.138 --> 05:49.265
Is that really Bjorn,
son of Ragnar,

05:49.808 --> 05:52.560
or some impostor who
just looks like him?

05:53.437 --> 05:55.855
I only do this
because I care about you.

05:55.939 --> 05:57.857
Or because I'm a woman.

05:58.733 --> 06:00.734
No.
Yes.

06:04.448 --> 06:05.614
Marry me.

06:06.658 --> 06:07.783
What?

06:08.952 --> 06:11.120
I asked you to marry me.
What is your answer?

06:15.459 --> 06:16.542
Yes.

06:17.461 --> 06:19.503
I will marry you, Bjorn.

06:19.588 --> 06:21.213
I will marry you.

06:27.137 --> 06:28.220
Good.

08:23.920 --> 08:25.713
Why did you do that?

08:28.258 --> 08:30.593
It's just
the angle of the leg.

08:31.803 --> 08:33.095
Couldn't help myself.

08:35.849 --> 08:37.433
There you are!

08:38.852 --> 08:40.894
I'm looking for your king.

08:46.276 --> 08:49.862
Of course,
you don't understand
a word I'm saying.

08:57.954 --> 08:59.705
Oh, thank you.

09:26.608 --> 09:27.733
No!

09:30.654 --> 09:33.489
At least you understood that!
Didn't you?

09:46.294 --> 09:47.336
No.

09:50.799 --> 09:52.216
Rollo!

10:15.990 --> 10:21.161
Athelstan, ask the King
who used to farm this
land he has given us.

10:31.881 --> 10:33.382
He confesses
that he has had to remove

10:33.466 --> 10:35.884
several Saxon farmers
from their lands.

10:37.387 --> 10:41.432
Then ask him
if they will not
be hostile to us?

10:41.516 --> 10:42.975
And if so,

10:43.560 --> 10:47.062
who will guarantee
the safety of our own
farms and communities?

11:09.461 --> 11:12.254
He will personally guarantee
our safety and security.

11:14.340 --> 11:17.259
I thank the King
from the bottom of my heart.

11:19.721 --> 11:23.056
It was always Ragnar's dream
to find land to farm

11:23.141 --> 11:26.602
for our young folk,
and to live
peacefully with others.

11:27.353 --> 11:30.272
Now, it is my dream, also.

11:46.706 --> 11:48.332
What does he say?

11:49.584 --> 11:52.169
He asks if you
are a free woman?

12:20.323 --> 12:23.408
They are coming!
Let us prepare!

12:23.493 --> 12:25.160
Look at what they've done.

12:25.245 --> 12:26.995
Look at the lead boat.

13:03.533 --> 13:07.536
My Lord,
your army has abandoned you
and gone. Save yourself!

13:09.163 --> 13:10.539
Burgred!

13:11.291 --> 13:13.375
Beloved brother!
Stay yourself.

13:15.670 --> 13:18.589
Wait and I will see
that you come to no harm!

13:19.340 --> 13:21.633
Burgred, please,
you must trust me!

13:21.718 --> 13:23.927
Abandon your false advisors.

13:24.512 --> 13:25.888
You must not trust her.

13:25.972 --> 13:28.015
She killed your brother
and she will kill you.

13:29.058 --> 13:30.642
But I do love her.

13:30.727 --> 13:32.644
Survive first,
love afterwards.

13:32.729 --> 13:35.147
Come. Come now,
or it's too late.

13:40.236 --> 13:41.486
My Lord.

13:43.531 --> 13:44.740
Burgred, wait!

15:11.661 --> 15:12.828
King Ecbert has arranged

15:12.912 --> 15:16.498
for some of the laborers
who worked here to
help us farm the land.

15:17.250 --> 15:18.250
Whoa.

15:36.811 --> 15:38.603
What are they saying?

15:39.188 --> 15:42.899
They're saying
their grandfathers
used some of these tools.

16:48.132 --> 16:50.133
May I tell you something?

16:51.719 --> 16:53.428
I have had a dream.

16:53.971 --> 16:55.931
I dreamed of a stranger,

16:56.265 --> 16:58.517
who was a man,
but he had no face.

16:58.601 --> 17:00.102
Or none that I could well see.

17:01.562 --> 17:02.729
There was snow on the ground

17:02.814 --> 17:04.648
and he was walking towards me
through the snow,

17:04.732 --> 17:07.192
so his footsteps
made no sound.

17:07.276 --> 17:09.361
His arms were outstretched,
and in one hand,

17:09.445 --> 17:11.613
he carried a ball
of flaming snow.

17:11.697 --> 17:12.823
In his other hand...

17:12.907 --> 17:15.117
His other hand was
covered in bright blood.

17:16.160 --> 17:18.245
And the blood left a trail
in the snow behind him.

17:18.329 --> 17:19.412
Yes.

17:19.497 --> 17:21.540
And the drops were smoking
in the frozen ground?

17:22.375 --> 17:23.708
You too?
Yes.

17:23.793 --> 17:24.751
Both of you?

17:24.836 --> 17:27.462
We have all dreamed
the same dream.

17:28.464 --> 17:30.465
Were you frightened?
No.

17:31.717 --> 17:33.260
I felt excited.

17:34.720 --> 17:36.763
I felt a sense
of expectation.

17:37.473 --> 17:40.892
And when I woke up,
I was so disappointed
it was only a dream.

17:41.811 --> 17:43.436
You are a vÃ¶lva.

17:44.313 --> 17:46.523
You say you can see things.
What does it mean?

17:47.859 --> 17:49.401
I have no idea.

17:50.945 --> 17:52.195
I do not know.

18:05.543 --> 18:08.837
I see a harvest
celebrated in blood.

18:10.047 --> 18:13.008
I see a trickster
whose weapon cleaves you.

18:13.843 --> 18:18.680
I see that a marriage
of plow and sword
will sustain you,

18:18.764 --> 18:22.142
until you become
a virgin once more.

18:40.703 --> 18:43.622
Athelstan, you should
bless this house.

18:43.706 --> 18:46.708
Ask God to bless
its new occupants.

18:48.127 --> 18:49.544
Let us pray.

18:50.379 --> 18:54.883
In the name of the Father,
the Son,
and the Holy Spirit, amen.

18:55.509 --> 18:57.135
I am thy Lord, thy God,

18:57.220 --> 18:59.679
which have brought you
out of the land of Egypt.

18:59.764 --> 19:01.848
Out of the house of bondage,

19:02.642 --> 19:04.100
thou shalt...

19:26.415 --> 19:29.584
Earl Ingstad has left
you to farm in England.

19:30.586 --> 19:32.504
What good is that to us?

19:34.757 --> 19:38.969
Peacefully, legally,
we have removed the Earl
that was never here,

19:39.929 --> 19:42.931
the Earl that came
to power by murder.

19:44.100 --> 19:48.812
And the Earl who has nothing
between his legs,
but a goat's beard.

19:50.898 --> 19:54.609
I will lead you as Earl,
if you will have me.

19:57.279 --> 19:59.239
All hail Earl Kalf!

20:00.449 --> 20:02.283
All hail Earl Kalf!

20:03.035 --> 20:08.039
All hail Earl Kalf!
All hail Earl Kalf!

20:08.916 --> 20:09.916
Hup, hup!

20:30.980 --> 20:32.480
She will come.

20:49.498 --> 20:51.499
Where would he have gone?

20:52.334 --> 20:54.878
Ragnar, my brother
is a prisoner of his advisors.

20:54.962 --> 20:56.588
Then where would
they take him?

20:56.672 --> 20:58.590
To the town,
to get reinforcements.

20:58.674 --> 20:59.841
That is not good.

21:02.678 --> 21:04.512
Go and find the town.

21:09.685 --> 21:10.894
Lead on.

21:15.858 --> 21:18.276
Why did you not go with them?

21:26.035 --> 21:28.453
Have we
any news of our army?

21:28.537 --> 21:29.746
Not yet.

21:30.831 --> 21:34.042
But with Ragnar Lothbrok,
how can we fail?

21:34.835 --> 21:37.003
Ever since I saw
Ragnar Lothbrok
and his kin

21:37.088 --> 21:40.965
at my father's house,
I've been fascinated
by these Northmen,

21:41.050 --> 21:42.926
especially by
their pagan ways.

21:43.344 --> 21:46.137
You were a monk at
Lindisfarne, Athelstan.

21:46.222 --> 21:48.973
But you lived
amongst the pagans.

21:49.058 --> 21:51.059
Tell me, what was it like?

21:53.896 --> 21:56.815
Lady Judith,
you are a good
Christian woman.

21:58.067 --> 22:00.151
How could I describe
such things to you?

22:02.071 --> 22:03.738
Try me.

22:12.248 --> 22:14.749
Imagine that
the sun shone at night,

22:15.084 --> 22:17.460
and the moon
during the day.

22:17.545 --> 22:20.588
And then imagine
that everything
you knew about Jesus Christ

22:20.673 --> 22:21.840
was not true,

22:22.675 --> 22:24.926
and that the true god
was a living man

22:25.386 --> 22:29.430
with a single eye,
a cloak, a wide-brimmed hat,

22:30.599 --> 22:32.517
and that this man,
Odin, the all-father,

22:32.601 --> 22:34.644
knew the secret
of every heart,

22:35.312 --> 22:37.438
and the destiny of all men.

22:38.566 --> 22:42.610
And that he, too,
was hanged from a tree,
and died and was reborn.

22:44.780 --> 22:49.033
Only, it happened
a long time before Christ.
Before our Lord.

22:50.452 --> 22:52.787
And do you believe
in this Odin?

22:56.834 --> 22:59.627
I've had to ask myself,
"What is belief?" My Lady.

23:43.172 --> 23:46.674
Stones are much easier
to wear than earth.

23:57.269 --> 23:58.603
May I?

24:26.131 --> 24:27.465
Beautiful.

24:59.081 --> 25:00.498
Ancient one?

25:09.883 --> 25:11.134
Where are you?

25:32.865 --> 25:34.949
He was bound...
And bleeding.

25:36.118 --> 25:38.161
So much blood upon him.

25:38.245 --> 25:40.204
So much blood everywhere.

25:41.415 --> 25:43.166
It was only a dream.

25:44.960 --> 25:46.627
Yes. Only a dream.

26:04.688 --> 26:05.813
Halt!

26:20.996 --> 26:22.997
You know of Lord Burgred?

26:24.083 --> 26:25.708
Of course you do.

26:27.586 --> 26:29.170
But where is he?

26:29.922 --> 26:31.381
I don't know.

26:31.465 --> 26:32.757
Where were you riding to?

26:38.347 --> 26:39.972
I had business in Repton.

26:40.682 --> 26:43.434
It must be very
important business.

26:43.519 --> 26:45.061
You were
riding like the wind.

27:05.207 --> 27:08.209
I don't know where
Lord Burgred is. Believe me.

27:19.638 --> 27:22.432
I don't believe you. Sorry.

27:27.771 --> 27:31.691
I could remove an eye,
or some teeth.
Do you have a preference?

27:39.032 --> 27:40.700
Why don't you just
say something?

27:41.577 --> 27:43.286
Mention a place...

27:44.580 --> 27:45.621
A name!

27:48.584 --> 27:50.460
Even if it's a lie,

27:50.544 --> 27:52.795
it might just save your
sight for a little while.

27:57.426 --> 28:00.261
There's an Iron Age fort
on top of the Hill of the Ash!

28:01.346 --> 28:03.222
Burgred and his army
have gone there.

28:03.307 --> 28:04.432
They're waiting
for reinforcements.

28:04.516 --> 28:05.600
All right.

28:16.278 --> 28:17.987
It's strange

28:18.739 --> 28:20.907
how you always know

28:21.658 --> 28:24.118
if someone is
telling the truth.

28:28.790 --> 28:31.125
I have no argument
with you, my friend.

28:32.961 --> 28:34.045
Let's sup together.

28:38.467 --> 28:40.843
We are not all
like the Northmen.

29:06.286 --> 29:07.370
Forgive me, My Lady, I...

29:08.080 --> 29:10.665
I did not want to
disturb you.

29:11.166 --> 29:12.792
I was just remembering...

29:12.876 --> 29:17.213
I'm sure you can never forget
being an artist. Nor a monk.

29:19.716 --> 29:22.218
Which is why I've come
to ask you a favor.

29:23.679 --> 29:25.596
I want you to
hear my confession.

29:26.848 --> 29:28.891
I was never a priest,
I couldn't...

29:28.976 --> 29:31.519
Bishop Edmund,
my confessor, is not here.

29:31.645 --> 29:34.355
And I must confess
or live in purgatory.

30:08.432 --> 30:11.058
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

30:12.853 --> 30:15.563
In what ways have
you sinned, my child?

30:16.565 --> 30:19.400
I have sinned in thought,
but not in deed.

30:20.736 --> 30:23.404
Then your sins
are not so great
as they might be.

30:24.323 --> 30:25.740
They are still great.

30:28.660 --> 30:31.162
What are these
thoughts you've had?

30:33.498 --> 30:35.833
I have dreamed
of lying naked

30:38.420 --> 30:40.921
beside a man
who is not my husband.

30:43.634 --> 30:48.095
And did you just
lie beside him, or...

30:48.388 --> 30:51.974
We made love.
And I enjoyed it very much.

30:54.561 --> 30:56.103
You've certainly sinned.

30:56.772 --> 30:57.813
Yes.

30:59.274 --> 31:00.441
Who...

31:02.486 --> 31:04.737
Who was this man
you lay with?

31:08.825 --> 31:12.078
It was you, Athelstan.

31:25.467 --> 31:26.675
Wait!

31:29.471 --> 31:31.806
I'm sorry.
You have no reason
to be sorry.

31:32.933 --> 31:33.933
None.

32:37.038 --> 32:39.123
I had a dream
last night.

32:39.207 --> 32:40.875
And in my dream

32:41.751 --> 32:45.796
Ragnar Lothbrok
tore the liver from my body,

32:46.631 --> 32:48.382
and began to eat it.

32:52.721 --> 32:54.513
I begged him to stop

32:55.557 --> 32:57.725
by saying that the liver

32:57.809 --> 32:59.351
is the seat of life.

33:00.228 --> 33:01.645
But he just smiled

33:02.314 --> 33:04.064
and went on eating,

33:04.858 --> 33:07.443
with blood
streaming down his chin.

33:09.321 --> 33:10.946
What did it mean?

33:11.907 --> 33:14.074
Who knows with dreams?

33:14.159 --> 33:16.577
Are you afraid
of Ragnar Lothbrok?

33:18.371 --> 33:20.789
What sensible man
would not be afraid

33:20.874 --> 33:22.875
of a farmer
who made himself a king?

33:23.543 --> 33:26.337
Yes, but you, too,
had humble beginnings.

33:27.172 --> 33:29.173
And not so humble dreams.

33:30.550 --> 33:33.552
So, you want to
be like Ragnar?

33:36.431 --> 33:39.683
I want to be famous
like Ragnar.

33:41.102 --> 33:42.269
Yes.

33:42.938 --> 33:46.273
I desire fame
above all things.

33:47.442 --> 33:51.779
I want the poets to
sing of my exploits as
they sing of Ragnar's.

33:53.198 --> 33:56.575
I want the gods
to pay an interest in me,

33:57.869 --> 34:00.538
and prepare the bright
halls for my coming.

34:01.456 --> 34:04.124
They say Ragnar is
descended from Odin.

34:05.877 --> 34:07.503
He is still human.

34:07.754 --> 34:08.963
If you cut him,

34:09.464 --> 34:10.965
he will bleed.

34:43.164 --> 34:44.832
Hey! You bastards.

34:45.458 --> 34:48.085
What, you couldn't have
done better, Torstein!

34:48.169 --> 34:50.379
I don't care
about that game.

34:51.214 --> 34:53.173
I want you
to cut off my arm.

34:56.469 --> 34:58.429
Why not keep it?

34:58.513 --> 35:00.306
Because it's
killing me, stupid.

35:01.266 --> 35:03.058
It's no good to me anymore.

35:04.227 --> 35:06.061
I don't want it.

35:06.146 --> 35:08.564
In fact,
I've always hated this arm.

35:09.357 --> 35:10.858
It has to go.

35:15.864 --> 35:16.989
I'll do it.

35:17.490 --> 35:18.490
Ah.

35:19.034 --> 35:20.576
Bjorn.

35:20.660 --> 35:22.494
Always so considerate.

35:22.579 --> 35:24.788
A real credit
to your father.

35:25.373 --> 35:26.415
But...

35:27.417 --> 35:29.293
I want Floki to do it.

35:33.798 --> 35:35.674
Will you do it, Floki?

35:37.218 --> 35:38.677
I suppose so.

35:40.597 --> 35:42.473
I would do the same for you.

35:42.557 --> 35:43.724
I know.

35:44.851 --> 35:46.894
That is why I shall do it.

35:49.397 --> 35:51.148
Cut off his sleeve.

35:53.568 --> 35:55.110
Come here.

36:31.106 --> 36:33.232
You sure
you want to go ahead?

36:33.608 --> 36:37.319
No, not my head.
Just cut off
the stinking arm, man.

36:38.113 --> 36:39.613
Get on with it.

36:53.461 --> 36:55.462
Too bad it's not
your flicking arm.

36:57.632 --> 36:59.299
You could have
saved some money.

37:10.729 --> 37:13.188
Freyr and Freya,
ye gods, be with him now.

37:20.864 --> 37:23.073
Earl Ingstad and I
would like to
thank both of you

37:23.158 --> 37:25.075
for your hospitality
and kindness.

37:25.160 --> 37:26.952
King Ecbert,
we remain in your debt

37:27.036 --> 37:29.288
for this gift
of land and hope.

37:29.372 --> 37:34.042
No, I remain in
your debt, Athelstan,

37:34.335 --> 37:37.921
for, on this journey,
you have suffered
grievously.

37:38.006 --> 37:40.841
And yet, it is you
who has taught me

37:40.925 --> 37:44.052
that it is possible to
respect two cultures,

37:44.137 --> 37:46.555
and to live in
amity between them.

37:47.390 --> 37:48.724
Thank you.

37:54.397 --> 37:56.190
Please tell Earl Ingstad

37:56.274 --> 37:59.443
how much I admire her
and that she is always,

37:59.527 --> 38:01.612
always welcome at my hearth.

38:15.835 --> 38:17.252
She says she likes
the necklace.

38:17.337 --> 38:20.172
It is so beautiful,
that it must have
been made by dwarves.

38:21.466 --> 38:23.425
We don't have dwarves
in England.

38:30.308 --> 38:33.727
She says, "Of course you do.
You just don't see them."

38:41.361 --> 38:43.779
You did not wait to
hear your penance.

38:43.863 --> 38:46.406
Here is my penance.
You are leaving.

38:47.283 --> 38:50.827
Is that not a good thing?
It saves you
from further sin.

39:16.854 --> 39:19.356
So you love
our young monk, do you?

39:22.068 --> 39:25.195
I do not love him.
He fascinates me.

39:27.031 --> 39:30.701
Well, be careful, Judith,
who you choose to
be fascinated by.

39:30.785 --> 39:33.954
It is true that the more
complicated a person is,

39:34.038 --> 39:36.498
the more interesting he is.

39:36.583 --> 39:38.375
But at the same time,

39:39.419 --> 39:41.420
the more dangerous he is.

39:42.755 --> 39:46.133
And would you say that
about yourself,
father-in-law?

40:19.000 --> 40:20.375
I see them!

40:23.588 --> 40:24.838
My Lord.

40:25.548 --> 40:27.341
I know where they are.
Where are they?

40:28.676 --> 40:30.427
On top of that hill.

40:32.722 --> 40:34.765
They're drawing us
away from our boats.

40:34.849 --> 40:36.433
Assemble the men.

40:38.102 --> 40:39.478
Aye, My Lord.

40:39.562 --> 40:40.896
Yes, My Lord.
Straight on!

42:02.228 --> 42:05.605
I've injured my
hand rather badly,
as you can see.

42:06.983 --> 42:08.358
I wonder,

42:09.318 --> 42:10.944
can you help me?
