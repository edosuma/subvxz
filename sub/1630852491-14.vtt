I recently saw a picture of you
in some magazine

10:26.538 --> 10:28.497

that I wear a hard hat,

36:35.628 --> 36:38.283
-This is what I got.
-Okay.

36:38.326 --> 36:40.285
Buffalo Bills
lost the Super Bowl

36:40.328 --> 36:42.504
four years in a row
when we were kids.

36:42.548 --> 36:44.289
-You remember that? Yeah.
-I do.

36:46.856 --> 36:48.945
-I'm not the Buffalo Bills.
-That's not what I'm saying.

36:48.989 --> 36:51.034
-Okay.
-Anyway, before
every Super Bowl,

36:51.078 --> 36:54.081
they make Super Bowl champion
merch with both teams on it

36:54.124 --> 36:56.431
so they have stuff ready
to go no matter who wins, right?

36:56.475 --> 36:58.825
-Mm-hmm.
-But once a team loses,

36:58.868 --> 37:01.610
they don't want the stuff
with the losing team on it.

37:01.654 --> 37:03.438
They don't want
"Super Bowl champion

37:03.482 --> 37:06.746
-Buffalo Bills" sweatshirts.
-Hmm.

37:06.789 --> 37:09.749
So, do you know
where that stuff used to go?

37:11.316 --> 37:12.317
I bet you're gonna tell me.

37:12.360 --> 37:13.622
-Other continents.
-Yeah?

37:13.666 --> 37:15.320
Africa. Asia.

37:15.363 --> 37:17.539
-Any and every nation in need.
-Huh.

37:17.583 --> 37:19.889

in the early '90s,

37:19.933 --> 37:22.327
there were world champion
Buffalo Bills merch

I-I don't know
where you're going...

Kev, there are
tens of thousands of people

37:30.813 --> 37:34.513
