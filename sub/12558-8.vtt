32:46.673 --> 32:50.462
BUT YOU MUST REALIZE THAT YOU
SAVV THEM ONLY IN YOUR MIND.

32:50.510 --> 32:52.547
THEY WERE REAL.

32:52.637 --> 32:55.971
TO YOU, THEY VVERE. THAT'S THE
VVAY IT IS VVITH HALLUCINATION.

32:56.057 --> 32:59.846
ORDINARILY, THE EYE SEES AND
TRANSMITS A PICTURE TO THE BRAIN.

32:59.936 --> 33:02.644
BUT SOMETIMES, THAT'S REVERSED.
IN CERTAIN CASES,

33:02.689 --> 33:07.729
THE BRAIN SEES AND TRANSMITS
ITS MESSAGE TO THE EYE.

33:07.819 --> 33:09.856
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

33:09.946 --> 33:12.233
<i>NO. THEY WERE REAL.</i>

33:14.534 --> 33:19.404
<i>\N THAT CASE, OTHERS WOULD
HAVE SEEN THEM, TOO.</i>

33:19.498 --> 33:21.409
ISN'T THAT SO?

33:21.500 --> 33:23.537
I DON'T KNOW.

33:23.627 --> 33:25.914
IT'S LOGICAL,
ISN'T IT?

33:26.004 --> 33:28.086
I SUPPOSE SO.

33:28.173 --> 33:30.665
BUT NO ONE
DID SEE THEM.

33:30.717 --> 33:33.709
NOW, HOW DO YOU
EXPLAIN THAT?

33:33.803 --> 33:35.180
I DON'T KNOW.

33:35.222 --> 33:37.133
<i>THINK ABOUT IT
FOR A MOMENT.</i>

33:51.530 --> 33:53.521
WELL, MR. PARKES?

33:53.615 --> 33:55.606
I DON'T KNOW WHY
NOBODY ELSE SAW THEM.

33:55.700 --> 33:57.782
MAYBE THEY
WEREN'T LOOKING.

33:57.869 --> 34:00.861
YOU SAID THAT THERE VVERE THREE
FIGURES IN THE DISPLAY CASE.

34:00.956 --> 34:03.539
A YOUNG GIRL, HER
MAID AND A MAN.

34:03.625 --> 34:04.911
THAT'S RIGHT.

34:05.001 --> 34:06.787
<i>LET'S LOOK AT IT
LOGICALLY FOR A MOMENT.</i>

34:06.878 --> 34:08.710
ACCORDING TO THE
MUSEUM OFFICIALS,

34:08.755 --> 34:11.964
THERE WAS ONLY
ONE FIGURE: THE GIRL.

34:12.050 --> 34:14.382
WHERE DID THE
OTHERS COME FROM?

34:14.427 --> 34:18.216
VVELL, THE MAID ALVVAYS
CAME FROM THE KITCHEN

34:18.306 --> 34:20.297
OR THE DINING ROOM.

34:20.391 --> 34:23.601
AND THAT-THAT FELLOW--

34:24.896 --> 34:27.103
YES. WHERE DID
HE COME FROM?

34:27.190 --> 34:28.806
OUTSIDE.

34:28.900 --> 34:30.561
<i>OUTSIDE THE CASE?</i>

34:30.610 --> 34:32.987
NO, OUTSIDE
THE HOUSE.

34:33.071 --> 34:36.234
MR. PARKES,
THINK ABOUT IT.

34:36.324 --> 34:39.567
THERE VVAS NOTHING OUTSIDE
THAT HOUSE BUT GLASS,

34:39.661 --> 34:43.949
AND BEYOND THAT, OTHER DISPLAYS.
ISN'T THAT TRUE?

34:44.040 --> 34:46.748
<i>YES, BUT HE CAME
IN THE FRONT DOOR.</i>

34:46.835 --> 34:50.498
AND THEY WENT OUT
TOGETHER ONCE, UH,

34:50.589 --> 34:53.331
TO THE OPERA OR SOMETHING.
l-l-l DON'T KNOVV.

34:53.425 --> 34:57.669
AND...SHE NEVER KNEVV VVHAT
KIND OF PERSON HE VVAS,

34:57.762 --> 34:59.264
BUT I COULD
HAVE TOLD HER.

34:59.347 --> 35:02.260
YOU ONLY HAD TO LOOK AT HIM TO SEE
VVHAT KIND OF PERSON HE VVAS.

35:02.309 --> 35:03.595
BUT SHE'S SO

35:05.103 --> 35:07.014
TRUSTING AND-
AND INNOCENT

35:07.105 --> 35:09.312
<i>AND HELPLESS.</i>

35:09.399 --> 35:11.606
NOT LIKE
OTHER WOMEN?

35:11.651 --> 35:12.891
<i>NO, NOT AT ALL.</i>

35:14.446 --> 35:16.357
HAVE YOU SEEN HER?

35:16.448 --> 35:17.688
YES.

35:17.782 --> 35:19.773
OH, WELL, IS-IS
SHE ALL RIGHT?

35:19.868 --> 35:21.950
L-I'VE BEEN
WORRIED SICK.

35:22.037 --> 35:23.493
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO SEE HER?

35:25.624 --> 35:27.456
YES.

35:34.966 --> 35:36.377
BE CAREFUL!

35:42.098 --> 35:45.136
<i>YOU'RE HOLDING A PIECE OF WOOD
IN YOUR HAND, MR. PARKES.</i>

35:47.312 --> 35:50.350
<i>A BEAUTIFULLY CARVED
PIECE OF WOOD.</i>

35:52.108 --> 35:53.724
DO YOU HAVE
TO TAKE HER BACK?

35:53.818 --> 35:55.809
I'M AFRAID SO.

35:55.904 --> 35:57.690
IT IS MUSEUM
PROPERTY.

35:59.157 --> 36:01.239
<i>NOW, I WANT YOU TO
GO BACK TO YOUR ROOM</i>

36:01.326 --> 36:03.317
<i>AND THINK ABOUT
WHAT I'VE SAID.</i>

36:03.411 --> 36:05.994
<i>WILL YOU DO THAT?</i>

36:07.165 --> 36:11.159
AND REMEMBER, I/I/HATYOU SAVV
IS NOT THE IMPORTANT THING.

36:11.211 --> 36:12.952
OUR JOB IS TO
FIND OUT <i>WHY.</i>

36:14.172 --> 36:16.254
<i>ONCE WE'VE
ACCOMPLISHED THAT,</i>

36:16.341 --> 36:18.252
<i>YOU'LL HAVE NO
MORE HALLUCINATIONS.</i>

36:47.205 --> 36:48.787
WHERE IS CHARLEY?

36:48.873 --> 36:51.126
OH, HE'LL BE HERE
IN A FEW MOMENTS.

36:51.209 --> 36:53.200
IS HE REALLY
NORMAL, DOCTOR?

36:54.462 --> 36:58.547
THAT IS A VVORD VVE TRY
NOT TO USE, MRS. PARKES.

36:58.633 --> 36:59.964
WHY NOT?

37:00.051 --> 37:01.291
<i>BECAUSE
IT'S MEANINGLESS.</i>

37:01.386 --> 37:03.718
"NORMAL" IN THE POPULAR
SENSE REFERS ONLY

37:03.763 --> 37:07.301
TO THE BEHAVIOR PATTERN OF THE
MAJORITY, AND THAT PATTERN

37:07.392 --> 37:10.430
<i>IS NOT
NECESSARILY GOOD.</i>

37:10.520 --> 37:15.640
VVELL-lF 99.9% OF THE PEOPLE
IN THE COUNTRY VVERE TO, UH,

37:15.734 --> 37:18.772
OH, GO TO BED VVITH THEIR
SOCKS ON, LET'S SAY,

37:18.862 --> 37:22.901
THEN GOING TO BED VVITH ONE'S SOCKS
ON VVOULD BE THE NORMAL THING TO DO.

37:22.991 --> 37:25.483
AND IF YOU DIDN'T, YOU
VVOULDN'T BE NORMAL, YOU SEE?

37:25.577 --> 37:29.536
OH, I GO TO BED VVITH MY
SOCKS ON ALL THE TIME.

37:30.707 --> 37:32.493
WHAT I'M TRYING
TO SAY IS,

37:32.584 --> 37:34.666
DON'T JUDGE CHARLEY'S
EMOTIONAL HEALTH

37:34.753 --> 37:37.962
BY THE DEGREE TO VVHIOH HE OONFORMS
TO OTHER PEOPLE'S STANDARDS.

37:38.047 --> 37:42.086
DON'T EXPECT HIM TO, VVELL,
BE LIKE OTHER PEOPLE.

37:42.177 --> 37:43.759
THEN YOU DON'T
THINK HE'S SICK?

37:43.845 --> 37:46.758
<i>NOT NOW, NO. HE WAS
WHEN HE CAME HERE.</i>

37:46.806 --> 37:49.844
THE CONSTANT PRESSURE OF TRYING
TO BE SOMETHING HE VVASN'T,

37:49.934 --> 37:52.767
OF TRYING TO ACT
AND FEEL AND THINK

37:52.854 --> 37:55.642
<i>THE WAYYOU WANTED HIM TO INSTEAD
OF THE WAY HE WANTED TO.</i>

37:55.732 --> 37:58.850
<i>WELL, THESE THINGS CONTRIBUTED
TO A SERIOUS BREAKDOWN.</i>

37:58.943 --> 38:03.028
<i>YOU SEE, WELL, CHARLEY WAS
UNABLE TO COPE WITH THIS WORLD,</i>

38:03.114 --> 38:06.197
SO HIS MIND CREATED
ANOTHER WORLD.

38:06.284 --> 38:10.278
OF COURSE, HE KNEVV IT VVAS
FALSE, AND HE DESTROYED IT.

38:10.330 --> 38:12.446
AND WITH THAT
FIRST STEP,

38:12.540 --> 38:16.158
HE STARTED BACK ON THE
ROAD TO MENTAL HEALTH.

38:16.252 --> 38:19.540
OF COURSE, HE INSISTED IT VVAS REAL
FOR A LONG TIME, AS YOU KNOVV,

38:19.631 --> 38:21.713
<i>BUT THAT IS
STANDARD BEHAVIOR</i>

38:21.800 --> 38:24.508
<i>IN CASES OF
HALLUCINATION.</i>

38:25.720 --> 38:28.758
THAT'S AN INTERESTING HABIT
YOU HA\/E, THAT, UH-

38:31.142 --> 38:32.473
WHY DO YOU DO IT?

38:39.859 --> 38:41.020
MYRA.

38:41.110 --> 38:42.817
HELLO, CHARLEY.

38:42.862 --> 38:44.603
OLD BUDDY.

38:46.616 --> 38:48.983
OH, MOTHER, HOVV
NICE OF YOU TO COME.

38:53.915 --> 38:55.405
HOW YOU

38:55.500 --> 38:57.741
OH, WONDERFUL, DOCTOR,
REALLY, WONDERFUL.

38:57.836 --> 38:59.998
I CAN'T TELL YOU HOVV
MUCH YOU'VE HELPED ME.

39:00.088 --> 39:02.045
NO MORE DREAMS?

39:02.131 --> 39:03.997
OH, I'\/E BEEN
SLEEPING LIKE A BABY.

39:05.343 --> 39:08.085
NOT VVORRIED ABOUT THE
GIRL IN THE DISPLAY CASE?

39:08.179 --> 39:11.717
THERE VVAS NO GIRL, JUST A DOLL.
I KNOVV THAT.

39:11.808 --> 39:15.517
AND I KNOVV VVHAT IT VVAS THAT
MADE ME THINK I SAVV VVHAT I SAVV,

39:15.562 --> 39:17.724
THANKS TO YOU.

39:17.814 --> 39:19.054
THANKS TO
YOU, CHARLEY.

39:19.148 --> 39:20.684
YOU FIGURED IT
OUT, REMEMBER?

39:20.775 --> 39:23.608
<i>I DIDN'T TELL YOU ANYTHING
AFTER THE FIRST DA</i> K

39:23.695 --> 39:26.437
[crying]

39:26.531 --> 39:28.522
NOW, MOTHER.

39:28.616 --> 39:30.869
OH, CHARLEY.

39:30.952 --> 39:34.035
I WAS SO WORRIED
ABOUT MY BABY.

39:34.080 --> 39:35.866
I WAS SO FRIGHTENED.

39:35.915 --> 39:37.451
I KNOW YOU WERE,
AND I'M SORRY

39:37.542 --> 39:40.705
I PUT YOU THROUGH SO MUCH
HEARTACHE, BUT I'M FINE NOVV.

39:40.753 --> 39:42.710
ISN'T THAT
RIGHT, DOCTOR?

39:42.839 --> 39:44.204
I THINK SO.

39:44.299 --> 39:47.291
AND I'LL GETAJOB, AND EVERYTHING
VVILL BE THE VVAY IT VVAS,

39:47.385 --> 39:49.296
JUST THE
WAY IT WAS.

39:58.938 --> 40:00.645
I SURE MISSED THIS.

40:00.732 --> 40:03.394
NO ONE CAN MAKE COCOA
THE WAY YOU CAN.

40:03.443 --> 40:05.559
DID THEY HURT
YOU, CHARLEY?

40:05.653 --> 40:09.021
VVELL, THEY VVERE AFRAID THEY VVERE
GONNA HA\/E TO USE SHOCK TREATMENT,

40:09.115 --> 40:10.901
AND I HEAR THAT
HURTS QUITE A BIT,

40:10.950 --> 40:13.237
BUT THEY DECIDED NOT
TO WHEN I GOT WELL.

40:13.328 --> 40:15.114
EVERYTHING ELSE
WAS FINE.

40:15.204 --> 40:18.333
THEY GOT A LOT OF NUTS IN
THAT PLACE, I GUESS, HUH?

40:18.416 --> 40:19.656
I DIDN'T MEAN HIM!

40:19.751 --> 40:22.743
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
I DON'T MIND.

40:22.795 --> 40:24.377
UH, MAY I HAVE
SOME MORE COCOA?

40:26.257 --> 40:29.750
<i>UH, CHARLEY, WE HAVE A
COUPLE OF SURPFUSES FOR YOU.</i>

40:29.844 --> 40:31.505

<i>FIRST OF ALL,

40:33.723 --> 40:36.090

40:36.142 --> 40:37.348
FINE.

40:37.435 --> 40:40.678
AND I TALKED
TO HARRIET

40:40.772 --> 40:43.184
AND EXPLAINED THINGS.

40:43.274 --> 40:46.437
BUT SHE'S A VVONDERFUL
GIRL, AND SHE UNDERSTANDS.

40:46.527 --> 40:48.518
WELL, FINE.

40:48.613 --> 40:52.106
AND YOU CAN TELL HER YOURSELF,
BECAUSE SHE'S COMING OVER TONIGHT.

40:52.158 --> 40:55.116
<i>WELL, THAT'S JUST WONDERFUL. THANK

40:55.203 --> 40:57.319

I'M SURE IT DID, BUT
YOU VVON'T BE SORRY.

41:03.211 --> 41:06.829
I INTEND TO
WORK VERY HARD.

41:07.882 --> 41:11.876
IF I'M GONNA BE FRESH FOR TONIGHT,
I'D BETTER GO GET A LITTLE REST.

A THING LIKE THAT?

43:55.216 --> 43:56.957

YOU, YOU WILL.</i>

46:03.427 --> 46:05.634
<i>I LOVE YOU, ALICE.</i>

46:07.265 --> 46:08.596
<i>I LOVE YOU.</i>

46:10.935 --> 46:12.517
I LOVE YOU.

46:14.105 --> 46:16.847
<i>SO THEN WE KNOCKED,
BUT HE DIDN'T ANSWER,</i>

46:16.941 --> 46:19.182
SO I HAD BUDDY KNOCK
DOVVN THE DOOR.

46:19.277 --> 46:22.360
I SEE. NOVV, HOVV VVOULD
YOU DESCRIBE HIS BEHAVIOR

46:22.446 --> 46:24.608
PRIOR TO HIS GOING
IN FOR THE NAP?

46:24.657 --> 46:26.694
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO PUT IT.

46:26.784 --> 46:29.947
IT WAS AS IF HE
WERE SO HEALTHY

46:30.037 --> 46:31.448
THAT I WAS WORRIED.

46:31.539 --> 46:33.780
IT VVAS LIKE HE DIDN'T HA\/E
A CARE IN THE VVORLD.

46:33.833 --> 46:36.200
SO I THOUGHT, "VVELL, MAYBE
HE VVENT TO THE MUSEUM,"

46:36.294 --> 46:38.376
SO I PHONED, BUT THEY'RE
CLOSED TONIGHT.

46:38.462 --> 46:39.839
SO WHERE
COULD HE BE?

46:39.922 --> 46:41.128
OH, HE'S THERE,
ALL RIGHT.

46:41.173 --> 46:43.130
BUT I JUST TOLD
YOU THEY'RE CLOSED.

46:43.175 --> 46:46.133
I EXPECT HE VVENT IN EARLIER
AND HID SOMEVVHERE.

46:46.220 --> 46:48.507
NOW, I WAS
JUST WONDERING--

46:50.808 --> 46:53.516
IF YOU VVOULD GO ALONG VVITH US, MR.
RUSSELL.

46:53.602 --> 46:54.728
SURE.

46:54.812 --> 46:58.055
IT MAY NOT BE NECESSARY, BUT
YOU NEVER CAN QUITE TELL.

46:58.149 --> 47:01.517
AND MRS. PARKES, YOU MIGHT BE ABLE
TO DO SOME GOOD, IF YOU'RE VVILLING.

47:01.610 --> 47:03.351
ANYTHING FOR
POOR CHARLEY.

47:03.446 --> 47:04.857
GOOD.

47:05.990 --> 47:09.199
DOCTOR, ARE YOU GONNA TAKE HIM
BACK THERE TO THE HOSPITAL?

47:09.285 --> 47:11.868
I THINK IT MIGHT
BE WISE, DON'T YOU?

47:16.917 --> 47:19.045
GIVE ME THE POLICE
DEPARTMENT, PLEASE.

47:20.046 --> 47:22.208
DR. WALLMAN
SAYS IT HAPPENED

47:22.298 --> 47:25.757
BECAUSE I NEEDED A SIMPLE
VVORLD I COULD UNDERSTAND,

47:25.843 --> 47:28.084
BUT YOUR VVORLD ISN'T
SIMPLE, IS IT?

47:28.179 --> 47:31.046
NO WORLD WITH
PEOPLE IN IT IS.

47:31.140 --> 47:32.551
THERE'S ALWAYS
LONELINESS

47:32.641 --> 47:34.848
AND SUFFERING
AND HEARTACHE.

47:34.935 --> 47:38.098
<i>LOOK AT YOU, CRYING
BECAUSE YOU'RE ALONE.</i>

47:38.189 --> 47:40.772
<i>WELL, I'VE BEEN
ALONE ALL MY LIFE.</i>

47:40.858 --> 47:42.849
<i>OH, PEOPLE
HAVE TRIED.</i>

47:42.943 --> 47:44.934
<i>MY MOTHER
AND MY SISTER--</i>

47:45.029 --> 47:48.112
THEY'VE TRIED VERY
HARD TO UNDERSTAND,

47:48.199 --> 47:50.110
BUT THEY CAN'T.

47:50.201 --> 47:52.533
<i>YOU COULD.</i>

47:54.121 --> 47:56.237
<i>WE COULD UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER</i>

47:57.458 --> 47:59.244

EACH OTHER AND

47:59.335 --> 48:00.996

GRANT IT'S POSSIBLE?

48:13.682 --> 48:15.138
BARELY.

48:16.018 --> 48:18.885
STRAIGHT AHEAD THERE. DO YOU
VVANT ME TO TURN ON THE LIGHTS?

48:18.979 --> 48:22.222
NOT YET. MRS. PARKES,
WILL YOU COME WITH ME?

48:22.274 --> 48:24.732

48:37.998 --> 48:41.286

ASK HIM TO COME OUT.

48:41.377 --> 48:42.742

CHARLEY.

48:44.839 --> 48:46.830
LOUDER.
COMMAND HIM.

48:46.924 --> 48:49.461
[firmly] OHARLEY, IT'S MOTHER.
COME OUT OF THERE.

48:49.552 --> 48:51.759
AGAIN.

48:51.846 --> 48:54.634
[sternly] COME OUT OF THERE
THIS SECOND, YOUNG MAN!

48:54.723 --> 48:56.509
YOU HEAR ME?

48:58.644 --> 49:01.181
ALL RIGHT, GUARD, YOU
CAN TURN THEM ON NOVV.

49:10.364 --> 49:11.604
ARE YOU SURE
HE'S HERE?

49:11.657 --> 49:12.988
I'M ALMOST POSITIVE.

49:13.075 --> 49:15.282
LET'S START LOOKING.

49:18.289 --> 49:20.280
CHARLEY?

49:20.374 --> 49:22.081
CHARLEY?

49:25.921 --> 49:27.298
CHARLEY!

49:58.329 --> 50:00.661
<i>(narrator) THEY NEVER
FOUND CHARLEY PARKE-S',</i>

50:00.706 --> 50:04.165

<i>HE KNEW WHAT THEY'D SAY, AND
HE KNEW HEY'D BE RIGHT, TOO,</i>
