WEBVTT

00:47.011 --> 00:49.012
Over here! Over here!

00:49.013 --> 00:53.975
Oh, look who we caught trying
to sneak by the paparazzi.

00:53.976 --> 00:56.019
It's pop star Casey
Cass, looking fabulous,

00:56.020 --> 00:58.980
and her new boyfriend, Dennis Hoge.

00:58.981 --> 01:01.858
You're looking very sexy, Casey!

01:01.859 --> 01:04.027
Oh, yes! Come on, Casey!

01:04.028 --> 01:06.571
- Yes! Right here!
- Give us a kiss!

01:06.572 --> 01:09.616
<i>And here's a peek at the British
sensation in her new video,</i>

01:09.617 --> 01:13.579
<i>featuring none other than
football striker Dennis Hoge.</i>

01:15.414 --> 01:18.917
<i>I don't care if you never get it</i>

01:18.918 --> 01:24.464
<i>It's not fair and
I never said it was</i>

01:24.465 --> 01:27.426
<i>it's just the way it is</i>

01:29.387 --> 01:33.014
<i>I won't fight it's
too late to listen</i>

01:33.015 --> 01:36.726
<i>You're not right,
and I'm not a victim</i>

01:36.727 --> 01:38.061
<i>No</i>

01:38.062 --> 01:42.732
<i>It's just the way it is</i>

01:42.733 --> 01:45.902
<i>I've had enough</i>

01:45.903 --> 01:49.906
<i>I'm gonna let you go</i>

01:49.907 --> 01:53.076
<i>You can leave me now</i>

01:53.077 --> 01:56.913
<i>You can walk away
and break my heart</i>

01:56.914 --> 02:00.959
<i>I don't need you now</i>

02:00.960 --> 02:03.086
<i>Turn around and
tear my world apart</i>

02:03.087 --> 02:07.048
<i>You can beg, you can cry
but I've made up my mind</i>

02:07.049 --> 02:10.719
<i>There'll be no next time this time</i>

02:10.720 --> 02:14.431
<i>So just let me know</i>

02:14.432 --> 02:16.099
<i>'Cause I don't want you</i>

02:16.100 --> 02:19.812
<i>around to drag me down</i>

02:28.779 --> 02:31.740
You know he's fucking Casey Cass?

02:31.741 --> 02:35.077
Casey fucking Cass?

03:16.160 --> 03:19.080
I love you, little one.

03:31.550 --> 03:33.176
Fuck.

03:33.177 --> 03:35.721
<i>Yes, I'll be right there.</i>

03:40.851 --> 03:42.602
- These are the cards.
- Uh-huh.

03:42.603 --> 03:45.981
They were playing a game,
and it ended quite badly.

03:47.108 --> 03:49.567
<i>So they came from the pub.</i>

03:49.568 --> 03:52.028
<i>All arrived together.</i>

03:52.029 --> 03:55.031
<i>Dennis Hoge, footballer
from Leicester.</i>

03:55.032 --> 03:58.577
<i>No prior convictions as an adult;</i>

04:02.790 --> 04:04.999
<i>Billy, from Rockford,</i>

04:05.000 --> 04:07.545
<i>one of his teammates;</i>

04:08.546 --> 04:11.549
<i>Tanya, a waitress;</i>

04:13.050 --> 04:16.219
<i>Mike and Katie, American students,</i>

04:16.220 --> 04:20.932
<i>just came over together
from Los Angeles;</i>

04:20.933 --> 04:23.602
<i>Kim and Brenda,
friends traveling together;</i>

04:26.856 --> 04:29.065
<i>and Missy Dembree,</i>

04:29.066 --> 04:31.860
<i>an American studying in London...</i>

04:31.861 --> 04:34.071
- I thought you said you were working late.
- Oh, come on, Dennis.

04:34.072 --> 04:36.239
I don't do anything
I don't want to do.

04:36.240 --> 04:38.576
You should know that.

04:41.203 --> 04:44.248
<i>Who didn't survive the evening.</i>

05:13.277 --> 05:16.864
Walk me through the final dare.

05:17.865 --> 05:21.951
Whose idea was it for Missy to
go along with Dennis and Mike?

05:21.952 --> 05:26.122
I think it was my idea. I said we
should take a pretty girl along.

05:26.123 --> 05:28.083
So, let me get this right.

05:28.084 --> 05:31.795
When she was explained the
game, she said her mother

05:31.796 --> 05:35.600
shot herself in the neck.
Is that right?

05:39.053 --> 05:41.971
Isn't that a bit of a coincidence?

05:41.972 --> 05:45.975
I mean, with the cards?

05:45.976 --> 05:49.729
What are we saying? That she
was some kind of prophet?

05:49.730 --> 05:52.315
That she knew what
was gonna happen?

05:52.316 --> 05:55.093
You wouldn't believe
me if I told you.

05:55.694 --> 05:57.153
Try me.

05:57.154 --> 06:01.825
When I got to London, she
said she'd seen her own death

06:02.326 --> 06:04.953
in a dream, shot and bleeding.

06:04.954 --> 06:07.206
Freaky.

06:40.031 --> 06:42.158
Tell me about the game.

06:43.743 --> 06:45.661
Your game.

06:47.079 --> 06:51.124
It wasn't really my idea.
The game was Missy's idea.

06:51.125 --> 06:55.086
Truth or dare,
essentially, but amped.

06:55.087 --> 06:57.381
NC-17 version.

06:59.216 --> 07:04.723
The mystique was bullshit, but
Missy made it so convincing.

07:07.349 --> 07:10.101
To the art of spirituality.

07:10.102 --> 07:11.811
Well, hey, it's the truth.

07:11.812 --> 07:14.356
We're lying and
getting away with it.

07:15.733 --> 07:17.401
Cheers.

07:24.116 --> 07:28.411
All right.
This is how we begin.

07:28.412 --> 07:32.791
By the pricking of my thumb,
something wicked this way comes.

07:32.792 --> 07:34.668
Oh, no way.

07:39.757 --> 07:41.091
Mike?

07:41.092 --> 07:42.426
Uh, no, I'll pass, thanks.

07:42.427 --> 07:44.844
Come on, Mike.
Don't be such a baby.

07:44.845 --> 07:46.971
I'd be careful if I were you.

07:46.972 --> 07:50.184
I mean, you never know when
you'll get another chance, right?

07:57.817 --> 07:59.901
Son of a...

07:59.902 --> 08:01.945
Is that even safe?
I don't know.

08:01.946 --> 08:05.865
Has everyone been tested?

08:05.866 --> 08:08.451
"Something wicked this way comes"...
that's MacBeth.

08:08.452 --> 08:11.329
Mm-hmm.
Remember how it ends?

08:11.330 --> 08:13.833
I do.
It ends bloody.

08:22.466 --> 08:26.261
You know they say our
throats are open graves,

08:26.262 --> 08:28.764
and with our tongues
we speak deceit.

08:46.198 --> 08:49.284
You miss that?
You wish.

08:49.285 --> 08:52.037
You can't get to me, sweetheart.
I see right through you.

08:52.038 --> 08:53.371
Uh-huh.
Now what?

08:53.372 --> 08:56.207
We can't start the game
until you drink this.

08:56.208 --> 08:58.209
What is it?

08:58.210 --> 08:59.878
Our blood.

08:59.879 --> 09:01.504
I'm in.

09:01.505 --> 09:05.384
Jesus!

09:06.510 --> 09:09.889
Absolutely vile.
It was yummy.

09:10.890 --> 09:14.100
Nasty!

09:14.101 --> 09:16.519
Oh, guys, you ready?
This is a game for adults,

09:16.520 --> 09:20.440
so if there's any kiddies in the house
who want out, now would be the time.

09:20.441 --> 09:23.193
Is it scary?
Only if you lie.

09:23.194 --> 09:25.361
I'm feeling good.
Let's play.

09:25.362 --> 09:27.238
If it's unlawful, I'm in.

09:27.239 --> 09:28.532
It'd be nice to have one new year's

09:28.533 --> 09:31.493
where you didn't puke
on my furniture, Billy.

09:31.494 --> 09:34.079
So are there, like, prizes?
Nope.

09:34.080 --> 09:35.538
Just penalties.

09:35.539 --> 09:38.375
Oh, Miss, this is
not gonna end well.

09:38.376 --> 09:41.002
Facebook snaps these are not.

09:41.003 --> 09:43.381
Oh, that's a real legacy
you've got there, Missy.

09:43.382 --> 09:46.383
It's sort of like a family heirloom passed
down from my grandmother to my mother.

09:46.384 --> 09:49.177
And then to you.
That's very cool.

09:49.178 --> 09:50.804
Yeah.

09:50.805 --> 09:53.973
I mean, my mom's not exactly
around anymore, but...

09:53.974 --> 09:57.143
Why? She shot herself
in the neck, right?

09:57.144 --> 09:59.312
Yep.
Bled to death.

09:59.313 --> 10:03.150
Since you crashed my party, Missy, I was
kind of hoping it'd be a lively time.

10:05.569 --> 10:08.029
Okay, guys, we'll go
through the entire deck.

10:08.030 --> 10:10.408
You can pick a card.
It's gonna be a dare or a question.

10:10.409 --> 10:12.410
If you get caught in a lie,
you get penalized by me.

10:12.411 --> 10:15.328
So how will you know?

10:15.329 --> 10:17.956
That's my gift.
Right, Dennis?

10:17.957 --> 10:20.208
Well, how do you win?

10:20.209 --> 10:23.211
You survive.
You go right down to the end.

10:23.212 --> 10:25.088
Who's in?

10:25.089 --> 10:27.257
All right.
Let's do it.

10:27.258 --> 10:29.427
One circle.
Come on.

11:20.102 --> 11:24.147
Okay, Katie, your turn.
I've never cheated on anyone.

11:24.148 --> 11:25.482
Liar!
Your turn, Kim.

11:25.483 --> 11:27.484
When I go to strip clubs,

11:27.485 --> 11:29.569
I bring quarters instead of singles

11:29.570 --> 11:33.281
'cause I feel like the strippers
definitely have a lot of laundry to do.

11:33.282 --> 11:35.618
You go, Brenda.

11:39.497 --> 11:42.457
Whoo!

11:42.458 --> 11:43.958
Okay, your turn, Tania.

11:43.959 --> 11:47.670
Have I ever committed a crime?
Tell us.

11:47.671 --> 11:50.007
Guess it's my turn.

11:51.967 --> 11:53.510
Uh, my turn?

11:53.511 --> 11:56.555
I think Katie's the one
who needs education.

12:00.226 --> 12:04.021
Why did you come to London
for the Christmas holidays?

12:18.411 --> 12:20.370
My parents are split,

12:20.371 --> 12:22.081
and it's messy at home.

12:24.250 --> 12:27.545
And I came because of Mike.

12:29.672 --> 12:32.550
I just want things to suffer a bit.

12:55.740 --> 12:58.450
It's almost midnight.

12:58.451 --> 13:01.620
Save me a kiss?

13:07.752 --> 13:12.089
I'm sorry, but it'd
just be so weird.

13:13.758 --> 13:17.093
Of course.
Right.

13:17.094 --> 13:19.429
Christ.

13:19.430 --> 13:21.723
God, what is this magic hold

13:21.724 --> 13:23.600
that Missy has over you, anyway?

13:23.601 --> 13:28.731
Can't you see that you're just
some kind of pet for her?

13:29.690 --> 13:32.526
Thanks for your honesty, pal.

13:38.157 --> 13:40.117
Fuck.

13:41.452 --> 13:44.162
I kept hoping he'd come
to his senses about Missy

13:44.163 --> 13:48.584
and reconsider me.

13:50.544 --> 13:53.756
I love him, I guess.

14:15.820 --> 14:18.572
Cheers, cheers.

14:26.372 --> 14:28.373
Were you in love with her?

14:28.374 --> 14:30.834
If I loved her and I
couldn't have her,

14:30.835 --> 14:33.461
that'd be motive, right?

14:33.462 --> 14:36.298
You're asking me?

14:46.851 --> 14:49.228
I'm so glad you're here.

15:00.239 --> 15:02.241
Whoa, Mike!

15:03.743 --> 15:08.496
Tell me, what did you
do to piss Mike off?

15:08.497 --> 15:11.416
Uh, I suppose I had some
things that he wanted.

15:11.417 --> 15:13.501
Um...

15:13.502 --> 15:15.712
Some measure of wealth,

15:15.713 --> 15:18.298
success, confidence.

15:18.299 --> 15:20.842
Most of all, I suppose,
I had Missy.

15:20.843 --> 15:23.887
And if he couldn't have her,

15:23.888 --> 15:26.556
then I guess filming me with her

15:26.557 --> 15:29.476
was the next best thing.

15:29.477 --> 15:31.603
Until we split.

15:31.604 --> 15:34.481
No, I think he hates
me for leaving her,

15:34.482 --> 15:38.861
but he hates her more for
still wanting me back.

15:46.744 --> 15:50.915
Whose turn is it?
It's Dennis' turn.

15:52.875 --> 15:55.877
What?

15:55.878 --> 15:57.755
Hey.

16:09.517 --> 16:13.395
Whose turn is it?
Uh, it's someone's turn.

16:13.396 --> 16:15.898
Uh, that would be
you, d-man. Boop!

16:17.316 --> 16:19.276
It's not my turn.

16:20.528 --> 16:23.781
All right.
Monsieur?

16:31.497 --> 16:34.457
"Steal something of value
from a complete stranger."

16:34.458 --> 16:36.835
So what, I'm supposed
to Rob someone?

16:36.836 --> 16:39.796
Ooh, and it can't be one of us.

16:39.797 --> 16:41.798
Right. Too risky.
I can't do it.

16:41.799 --> 16:45.510
Really? Just like that,
Dennis? Mr. quitter?

16:45.511 --> 16:49.639
I'm not quitting. It's just...
that's why they call it a dare.

16:49.640 --> 16:52.225
So I get arrested for
filching some shit?

16:52.226 --> 16:53.643
If only.

16:53.644 --> 16:57.522
I'll go along.
Make it seem like a college prank.

16:57.523 --> 17:00.942
If we take a pretty girl, we can
pretty much get away with anything.

17:00.943 --> 17:03.320
I'll go as witness.
And how about we up the stakes,

17:03.321 --> 17:05.655
and both you guys have
to steal something?

17:05.656 --> 17:08.491
And when you come back,
you'll get a reward.

17:08.492 --> 17:10.617
What kind of reward?
Fuck it, all right?

17:10.618 --> 17:12.704
You get caught, it's
a slap on the wrist.

17:12.704 --> 17:14.830
Me, it's in the news.
I'm suspended.

17:14.832 --> 17:18.626
Casey leaves me.
I lose everything.

17:18.627 --> 17:20.502
Oh!

17:20.503 --> 17:22.381
So what are we waiting for?

18:19.647 --> 18:23.066
Quiet. Guys, shh.

18:23.067 --> 18:25.443
Why are we stopping?
All right.

18:25.444 --> 18:27.445
That'll do.

18:27.446 --> 18:30.324
What's a little breaking and
entering among friends, right?

18:42.753 --> 18:45.088
Come on, mate.

18:45.089 --> 18:47.967
This is so illegal.

18:57.810 --> 19:00.438
Remind me again why
we're doing this.

19:04.108 --> 19:06.860
- Please be careful.
- Mike, come on.

19:06.861 --> 19:09.612
That's my Jersey.
Take it off.

19:09.613 --> 19:11.448
What? It was cold.
And besides,

19:11.449 --> 19:14.493
it's the least you owe me, right...
a little souvenir?

19:16.954 --> 19:19.415
You are seriously bent.

19:20.750 --> 19:23.461
I'd make a decent thief.

19:35.097 --> 19:38.141
Hey, how's Casey, Dennis?
She Miss you?

19:38.142 --> 19:41.144
Look, you have got to release
those claws, all right?

19:41.145 --> 19:43.146
I'm in love with her.
It's happening.

19:43.147 --> 19:45.523
Dennis, I'm sorry, but I know you,

19:45.524 --> 19:47.818
and you're gonna get bored within 5
minutes and then what's gonna happen?

19:47.819 --> 19:51.780
You're delusional.
You're not gonna let this go, are you?

19:51.781 --> 19:54.657
Turn it off, Mike.

19:54.658 --> 19:56.743
I've never made you
any promises, Miss.

19:56.744 --> 20:00.580
That's true, but consequences
mean more than promises.

20:00.581 --> 20:03.833
I mean, they can't exactly bend.

20:03.834 --> 20:07.003
That sounds like something
that Michael would say.

20:07.004 --> 20:09.089
That's 'cause I did say it.

20:09.090 --> 20:11.175
It's a real shame we never
had a proper goodbye fuck.

20:11.176 --> 20:13.010
Maybe I should leave you two alone.

20:13.011 --> 20:14.928
No, we need you as a witness.

20:14.929 --> 20:16.721
Yeah, keep the camera rolling.

20:16.722 --> 20:19.015
I don't think I'd trust
myself if you didn't.

20:19.016 --> 20:22.186
No, keep it off.

20:31.862 --> 20:34.115
Come on.
I dare you.

20:45.584 --> 20:47.586
Anyone here?

20:48.838 --> 20:50.965
Hello?

20:51.841 --> 20:54.009
Hello?

21:01.892 --> 21:03.226
Hurry up!

21:03.227 --> 21:05.604
But there's nothing
here to load it.

21:06.897 --> 21:08.648
I found a watch.

21:08.649 --> 21:11.235
There's some cash in here.
Not much.

21:16.657 --> 21:20.076
- Ah! Bloody hell! What was that for?
- Why'd you hit him?

21:20.077 --> 21:22.579
Happy new year, Dennis.

21:22.580 --> 21:23.997
Fucking bitch.

21:23.998 --> 21:26.584
Put it away. It's not even loaded.

21:28.127 --> 21:30.254
- It is now.
- Missy, you weren't supposed to load it.

21:30.255 --> 21:32.088
Give me your cell phone.

21:32.089 --> 21:35.258
- Okay, easy, Missy. Just come on.
- Do it.

21:35.259 --> 21:39.095
Are you in on this too, you prick?

21:39.096 --> 21:41.097
You know what? You are
so fucking unbelievable.

21:41.098 --> 21:43.641
You think you can just forget about me?
That I'm that disposable?

21:43.642 --> 21:46.062
Right, here it is.

21:46.937 --> 21:49.522
What do you want?

21:49.523 --> 21:54.611
I'm gonna call Casey from your cell
phone, tell her we were pregnant.

21:54.612 --> 21:57.073
She wants to marry you after that, fine.
That's her business.

21:57.074 --> 21:59.741
But I am sick of you
lying about this.

21:59.742 --> 22:01.910
Is that your plan? To destroy me?
Call my girl?

22:01.911 --> 22:03.286
It's a start.

22:03.287 --> 22:05.623
What do you really want, Miss?

22:06.290 --> 22:09.793
Really? What do I want, Dennis?

22:09.794 --> 22:12.253
What do I want?

22:12.254 --> 22:15.048
How about I want you
to tell everybody

22:15.049 --> 22:17.967
the fucking truth about us?

22:17.968 --> 22:19.886
I took care of it.

22:19.887 --> 22:24.960
Oh, really? $500, huh? You think that's
gonna take care of it? 500 fucking dollars?

22:24.986 --> 22:27.143
- You think that's taking care of it?
- I'm not even sure it was mine.

22:27.144 --> 22:29.938
You take that back.

22:29.939 --> 22:32.650
All right.

22:34.985 --> 22:36.611
Cranky psycho bitch.

22:36.612 --> 22:38.822
Dennis, shut your mouth!
You're not helping!

22:38.823 --> 22:42.076
What, do you think? She's gonna blow
you now? Be your one true love?

22:43.619 --> 22:46.037
It's ringing.

22:46.038 --> 22:48.206
<i>Hi, babe.</i>

22:48.207 --> 22:50.333
Hey, you're not gonna believe this.

22:50.334 --> 22:51.961
Hi, Casey.
You wouldn't believe this.

22:51.962 --> 22:55.171
It's actually Missy,
Dennis' ex-girlfriend.

22:55.172 --> 22:58.299
<i>- Dennis, are you okay?</i>
- No, actually, I'm not.

22:58.300 --> 23:01.011
These two are really...
Jesus fuck!

23:08.018 --> 23:09.352
What happened?

23:09.353 --> 23:13.733
Missy's dead! Dennis shot her!
Dennis shot her!

23:13.734 --> 23:15.859
Shut up! Shut up!

23:15.860 --> 23:17.737
She came up here and
killed herself.

23:17.738 --> 23:20.114
No, Dennis did it!

23:20.906 --> 23:24.201
You're insane.

23:26.203 --> 23:29.372
So, it wasn't a suicide?

23:29.373 --> 23:32.876
They struggled, and
the gun went off.

23:32.877 --> 23:34.961
He shot her.

23:34.962 --> 23:36.756
You positive?
Yes.

23:39.300 --> 23:42.219
Can we be done?

23:43.763 --> 23:46.389
Are you serious?

23:46.390 --> 23:48.767
Look, you could call
it an accident.

23:48.768 --> 23:52.396
But he wanted to be rid of her.
He wanted her dead.

23:54.398 --> 23:57.400
You stopped filming
before the robbery.

23:57.401 --> 23:59.778
<i>Can you step out
from behind the camera?</i>

23:59.779 --> 24:02.113
Why was that?

24:02.114 --> 24:03.990
Dennis told me to.

24:03.991 --> 24:06.593
Oh, you do everything
Dennis tells you to?

24:06.619 --> 24:09.371
No. The gun went off
in Dennis' hand.

24:09.372 --> 24:11.248
That could be considered
manslaughter, right?

24:11.249 --> 24:14.751
Dennis told one of my colleagues
that you brought the gun for Missy.

24:14.752 --> 24:18.254
Me? No, she got the gun
out of the bedroom.

24:18.255 --> 24:20.256
I just went along because I...

24:20.257 --> 24:22.426
I don't know. I mean, the
guy's such a cocky fuck.

24:22.427 --> 24:26.663
I just liked the idea of
rattling his cage a bit.

24:27.264 --> 24:30.976
Did he tell you that he's the one
who taught her how to use the gun?

24:38.275 --> 24:40.778
How did Missy meet Dennis?

24:49.286 --> 24:53.374
<i>Dennis had dropped out of school.
He got lucky with soccer.</i>

24:57.128 --> 25:01.005
<i>Missy wrote me, bragging
about this soccer stud</i>

25:01.006 --> 25:03.384
<i>and all their sordid details.</i>

25:21.485 --> 25:25.155
So what brought you
back to London from L.A.?

25:25.156 --> 25:25.957
"Back"?

25:25.983 --> 25:29.159
You came in September,
right, to visit Missy.

25:29.160 --> 25:31.829
So how come you're back so soon?

25:34.498 --> 25:38.293
<i>"All other things
to their destruction draw;</i>

25:38.294 --> 25:40.503
<i>only our love
hath no decay."</i>

25:40.504 --> 25:43.339
<i>Do you know that poem?
I miss you.</i>

25:43.340 --> 25:45.508
<i>No, you miss this.
You are so filthy.</i>

25:45.509 --> 25:48.011
Oh, Mike, you're such a cub scout.

25:48.012 --> 25:50.513
<i>Hey, um, are you
coming back for college?</i>

25:50.514 --> 25:52.891
'Cause dorm space is
kind of filling up.

25:52.892 --> 25:55.019
I don't really know yet.
I haven't really thought about it.

25:55.020 --> 25:57.063
Why don't you come for new year's?
We can talk about it.

25:57.064 --> 25:59.148
<i>I don't know if I can.
Things are kind of tight.</i>

25:59.149 --> 26:01.983
Katie friended me on Facebook.
She wants to come. So get on that.

26:01.984 --> 26:04.986
Plus Dennis just got this amazing
place in South Kensington.

26:04.987 --> 26:07.864
<i>He's even letting me fix it up.
You are?</i>

26:07.865 --> 26:11.076
<i>Yep. I mean, my good taste and his cash...
we can go all the way, right?</i>

26:11.077 --> 26:13.162
Plus he's high scorer now,
which means he got that, like,

26:13.163 --> 26:15.872
golden boot thing and probably
even go premier at this point.

26:15.873 --> 26:18.541
That's great, but seriously, when's
the last time the guy read a book?

26:18.542 --> 26:20.377
Sorry, got to go.

26:20.378 --> 26:22.087
Miss, I was wondering if you...

26:22.088 --> 26:23.923
<i>I'll call you later.</i>

26:45.486 --> 26:48.196
Was being filmed
a turn-on for Missy?

26:48.197 --> 26:50.407
Yeah, I suppose.

26:50.408 --> 26:52.992
She wanted me to record everything.

26:52.993 --> 26:56.247
<i>So glad that we came.</i>

27:01.127 --> 27:04.880
Hello. How've the boys been?
Dude.

27:08.259 --> 27:12.554
Yo, Mike, why don't you step out
from behind the camera for once?

27:12.555 --> 27:15.598
- What?
- Is it really that much harder...

27:15.599 --> 27:20.603
Yes, it's his shield. Entitles you to
the intimacy you want but can't have.

27:20.604 --> 27:25.484
Smart girl. But if I can't
have it, why not watch it?

27:26.485 --> 27:30.614
Because it ain't real.
The camera sees all.

27:32.116 --> 27:34.618
Like this?

27:40.541 --> 27:45.253
- Bit of a cassavetes, are we?
- That would just be presumptuous.

27:45.254 --> 27:47.631
For someone so self-deprecating?

27:49.550 --> 27:53.011
I just like getting what's real.

27:53.012 --> 27:55.638
<i>I suppose I hadn't meant
it to get this real.</i>

27:55.639 --> 28:00.643
<i>What did you do when you first
arrived here for the holidays?</i>

28:00.644 --> 28:02.645
<i>I left Katie at the hotel,</i>

28:02.646 --> 28:04.607
<i>and I went straight to Missy's.</i>

28:04.608 --> 28:07.443
<i>Mike, you shouldn't be here.</i>

28:18.662 --> 28:21.040
I just want to kill myself.

28:22.333 --> 28:25.293
Stop it.

28:25.294 --> 28:27.046
Come on.

28:31.342 --> 28:33.677
God, I love you.

28:36.514 --> 28:40.684
I swear, Mike, you're the closest
thing I've ever had to a brother.

28:56.325 --> 28:58.243
Whoa, Mike!

28:58.244 --> 29:00.371
I'm sorry. What the fuck
do you think you're doing?

29:00.372 --> 29:02.539
I'm sorry. I just... I
think you deserve better.

29:02.540 --> 29:06.042
You know everything Dennis could
give you, I could give you that.

29:06.043 --> 29:07.252
Mike...

29:07.253 --> 29:11.381
This is not what I want
from you. Okay? Jesus.

29:11.382 --> 29:13.250
Couldn't you just one
day see us becoming...

29:13.276 --> 29:17.053
No! All right? No, no, no. You and
me, we are friends, all right?

29:17.054 --> 29:21.433
That is all we are
ever going to be.

29:21.434 --> 29:24.061
- God! M...
- Missy.

29:25.563 --> 29:28.565
Just... remember that
one day in New York...

29:28.566 --> 29:31.067
Yes. Yes, Mike. Almost, okay?

29:31.068 --> 29:33.070
It never happened because
there's gonna be mistakes.

29:33.071 --> 29:36.073
- So will you just fucking forget about that?
- I can't.

29:39.577 --> 29:42.454
You didn't tell Dennis that you
and I fooled around, did you?

29:42.455 --> 29:44.289
- No.
- Mike...

29:44.290 --> 29:46.584
No, I didn't.

29:48.419 --> 29:51.379
Why does...

29:51.380 --> 29:54.592
Why does he hate me?

29:56.093 --> 30:00.138
Missy, I... I look at you, and

30:00.139 --> 30:02.766
I could be anything

30:02.767 --> 30:04.768
that Dennis, could be

30:04.769 --> 30:09.607
- and I would do anything to be in his place.
- No, fuck you, Mike. I want you out.

30:10.733 --> 30:13.610
Okay? You said you'd
come here to help me,

30:13.611 --> 30:16.321
and now you're fucking
hitting on me?

30:16.322 --> 30:18.406
You think that's what I need?

30:18.407 --> 30:20.659
I'm serious. Go.

30:25.623 --> 30:28.125
I would've been good to you.

30:33.381 --> 30:35.465
I loved her,

30:35.466 --> 30:38.594
so I got as close as I could.

30:48.479 --> 30:50.605
So how well did you know Missy?

30:50.606 --> 30:52.232
We were roommates.

30:52.233 --> 30:54.610
Lived in a house with
some other friends.

30:58.823 --> 31:02.201
She was my real education.

31:08.833 --> 31:11.668
He said I wanted to string
on one, any of them,

31:11.669 --> 31:14.839
anything to show that
superior simpering composure.

31:48.539 --> 31:50.881
Why did he bring Missy
on the evening?

31:50.907 --> 31:54.836
He didn't. <i>She got there ahead of us.
He kind of liked it, though.</i>

31:54.837 --> 31:58.757
Her never backing down,
competing for him.

31:58.758 --> 32:02.554
We've got dance,
we've got dance music.

32:04.555 --> 32:08.349
<i>Katie and I planned to meet Missy
at work on new year's eve.</i>

32:08.350 --> 32:11.771
<i>Nice little pub where Dennis
and his friends hang out.</i>

32:17.443 --> 32:19.903
- Come inside.
- What? All right.

32:19.904 --> 32:23.573
- Hey.
- Hey. So we're cool, huh?

32:23.574 --> 32:25.450
Yeah.

32:25.451 --> 32:27.327
New year, right?

32:27.328 --> 32:30.288
- Hey, girl. Good to see you here.
- Hi.

32:30.289 --> 32:33.875
We're going places, mate.

32:33.876 --> 32:35.919
No, don't be daft. I mean,

32:35.920 --> 32:38.797
you know what they paid Robinho
to transfer to Real Madrid?

32:38.798 --> 32:42.467
- Lot of cash?
- 30 million.

32:42.468 --> 32:44.844
Oh, where's Dennis?

32:44.845 --> 32:47.222
Place is a mess.
I've just moved in.

32:47.223 --> 32:49.599
Who is this?

32:49.600 --> 32:51.894
Uh, it's Tanya, Dennis.

32:52.937 --> 32:54.938
Missy's friend? Oh, fuck.

32:54.939 --> 32:57.732
I hope you get your
goddamn curtains.

32:57.733 --> 32:59.317
I'll be right back.

32:59.318 --> 33:00.902
- Okay.
- All right.

33:00.903 --> 33:03.322
Let's drink our faces off.

33:04.573 --> 33:07.659
I'm Billy.
You party?

33:07.660 --> 33:09.452
Well, that depends.

33:09.453 --> 33:12.580
You convince Dennis to
come along, and I'm in.

33:12.581 --> 33:15.500
If he doesn't mind his ex
tagging along, that is.

33:15.501 --> 33:16.918
No, no, no.

33:16.919 --> 33:19.295
Tanya's all right,
but no Missy, all right?

33:19.296 --> 33:22.590
She's... she's mental, all right?
I swear to God she's gone balmy.

33:22.591 --> 33:25.803
Oh, come on, bad boy.

33:28.597 --> 33:31.808
All right, fuck it, right?
But no Missy, all right?

33:31.809 --> 33:33.268
All right.

33:33.269 --> 33:35.353
- All right. Let's go in.
- Yeah.

33:35.354 --> 33:36.772
Come on.

33:47.992 --> 33:51.995
Oh, so this is your
fuck-able London crowd, huh?

33:51.996 --> 33:55.832
Yep. Bankers and
yuppie losers and...

33:55.833 --> 33:58.626
He's cute.
Yeah.

33:58.627 --> 34:00.962
And he likes Americans.

34:00.963 --> 34:03.673
Whoa! You girls look thirsty!

34:03.674 --> 34:07.386
- We are. So thirsty.
- Cheers.

34:08.637 --> 34:11.389
- Okay, cross.
- Cross, cross. Drink.

34:19.648 --> 34:21.984
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

34:25.404 --> 34:27.655
Daddy, daddy, daddy.

34:27.656 --> 34:29.366
That tickles!

34:29.367 --> 34:30.867
Can I get one more?

34:30.868 --> 34:33.703
Blondie!
What's up, surfer girl?

34:33.704 --> 34:36.040
Dude, what the fuck?
Come on, we know you want to play!

34:36.041 --> 34:39.876
Get off me, you stupid fuck.
Let her go.

34:39.877 --> 34:42.797
You'd better calm the fuck down!

34:54.850 --> 34:57.519
Told you Missy's party's
gone for fucking males.

34:57.520 --> 35:00.522
I'm not here for you, Dennis.
I'm here for Missy.

35:00.523 --> 35:04.734
Fine, whatever.
You ever seen her like this?

35:04.735 --> 35:06.486
No.

35:06.487 --> 35:09.739
I'm mean, she's always been intense.
She's an artist.

35:09.740 --> 35:12.034
Oh, please.

35:15.913 --> 35:17.914
What'd she say to you?

35:17.915 --> 35:19.916
She said at the time
he was nothing,

35:19.917 --> 35:23.086
and so she's going to destroy me.

35:23.087 --> 35:26.589
- You asked for it.
- We broke up. It happens, all right?

35:26.590 --> 35:29.843
- I didn't ask for this insanity.
- Why don't you stop being a dick to her, man.

35:29.844 --> 35:33.596
I tried. If she wants to
detonate her own life, fine,

35:33.597 --> 35:38.101
but if she's gonna bring me down
with it, that's another story.

35:38.102 --> 35:40.937
Okay, she's coming back
after the holidays,

35:40.938 --> 35:45.066
and I am done with this shit.

35:45.067 --> 35:48.945
Oh, hey! Rikki and Brenda,
the shot-glass sisters.

35:48.946 --> 35:51.489
Oh, yeah, nice. You survived.

35:51.490 --> 35:53.074
Where are you from?

35:53.075 --> 35:56.661
- Come with us, and we'll tell you.
- Come on.

35:56.662 --> 35:58.580
So, I suppose Missy

35:58.581 --> 36:00.832
was trying to get you
back in the sack.

36:00.833 --> 36:03.127
Yeah, absolutely.

36:04.712 --> 36:07.505
She's kind of a terror in bed.

36:07.506 --> 36:09.507
Sort of scary.
Mm.

36:09.508 --> 36:12.010
Which is cool.

36:12.011 --> 36:14.846
But, no, this thing
with Casey is real.

36:14.847 --> 36:16.848
I'm not that reckless.

36:16.849 --> 36:19.018
No. Of course.

36:22.146 --> 36:24.147
Glad we could do this.
It's gorgeous.

36:24.148 --> 36:27.484
I'm so happy for you.

36:27.485 --> 36:29.153
I'm so happy.

36:32.823 --> 36:35.658
So, dad, this is
your future son-in-law.

36:35.659 --> 36:38.537
Right, Dennis?

36:39.830 --> 36:42.123
Um, do you know I have, um...

36:42.124 --> 36:45.835
I'll be right back, all right?
Of course.

36:45.836 --> 36:47.963
See you in a bit, all right?

36:50.925 --> 36:53.551
Do you think he was
having second thoughts?

36:53.552 --> 36:55.011
No.

36:55.012 --> 36:57.013
No, Casey's the brass ring.

36:57.014 --> 36:59.808
Pedigree family.
Third-generation money.

36:59.809 --> 37:01.476
Superstardom.

37:01.477 --> 37:05.523
Dennis is a pig like that.
He's drawn to the trough.

37:25.126 --> 37:29.045
So, booze, hash, class as?

37:29.046 --> 37:32.550
Yeah. Billy was like Santa Claus.

37:34.093 --> 37:36.970
Everyone cooperated just like that?
Yeah.

37:36.971 --> 37:42.225
You'd be surprised how far people
go to keep the thrills alive.

37:42.226 --> 37:44.227
Your doctor is in the house.

37:44.228 --> 37:46.771
Orange if you're feeling lethargic;

37:46.772 --> 37:49.191
yellow for a mellow ride;
And my personal favorite,

37:49.192 --> 37:51.234
sky blue for just general purpose.

37:51.235 --> 37:54.071
All right.
Mellow yellow.

38:04.081 --> 38:06.207
Hey, babe.
Miss you.

38:06.208 --> 38:08.251
I'm gonna go outside.
I can't hear you.

38:08.252 --> 38:11.630
I can't hear.
I'll steal outside, all right?

38:38.657 --> 38:40.867
Shit. No way.

38:40.868 --> 38:43.621
What is it?
I don't know.

38:45.164 --> 38:49.125
"Pick a witness, and in
front of him or her,

38:49.126 --> 38:52.295
pleasure yourself."

38:52.296 --> 38:55.965
I'm not doing that.
What are you...

38:55.966 --> 38:58.301
Who are you taking?
I'm not...

38:58.302 --> 39:01.012
okay, Dennis.
What?

39:01.013 --> 39:04.265
All right, fine.

39:04.266 --> 39:07.268
What a wuss.
All right, let's go.

39:07.269 --> 39:09.854
- Fuck you, man. I'm kidding.
- Come on, sweetheart.

39:09.855 --> 39:12.316
What, are you chickenshit?

39:13.859 --> 39:17.321
All right, we'll see
you in a few minutes.

39:21.242 --> 39:24.160
I am not rubbing one out
in front of you, man.

39:24.161 --> 39:27.747
No shit, but I need to talk to you.

39:27.748 --> 39:30.166
What is Missy's plan?
This game, this night?

39:30.167 --> 39:33.713
I know it's a big "fuck you,"
but what's the climax?

39:36.173 --> 39:39.175
I don't know.
Why do you keep protecting her?

39:39.176 --> 39:43.180
You know she only keeps you around 'cause
you're a sweet fucking convenience.

39:46.183 --> 39:48.351
Nice try.

39:48.352 --> 39:51.855
"Ordinary riches can be stolen.
Real riches cannot."

39:51.856 --> 39:55.108
You know the quote?
No fucking clue what you're talking about.

39:55.109 --> 39:57.360
Didn't expect you to.

39:57.361 --> 39:59.988
What are you playing at?

39:59.989 --> 40:02.241
Huh? What is it?

40:03.159 --> 40:04.659
You know, I...

40:04.660 --> 40:07.120
I don't get the sense
of entitlement.

40:07.121 --> 40:10.040
Like others are dispensable.
You deserve it all.

40:10.041 --> 40:11.791
It's worked pretty well so far.

40:11.792 --> 40:16.630
Your problem is, Michael,
that you care too much.

40:19.050 --> 40:20.967
So, tell me,

40:20.968 --> 40:23.387
what is Missy planning?

40:28.768 --> 40:30.394
Why should I?

40:43.240 --> 40:46.076
What is it?
Don't know.

40:46.077 --> 40:48.411
But picture it.
They're both so young.

40:48.412 --> 40:52.750
Guys, it's pretty basic.
You've done it before.

40:55.252 --> 40:58.255
He didn't do it.

41:16.399 --> 41:19.192
Missy says you have
to finish the dare.

41:19.193 --> 41:21.152
Katie wanted to help.

41:21.153 --> 41:23.822
Oh, uh, no.

41:23.823 --> 41:25.407
<i>You are yummy.</i>

41:25.408 --> 41:29.745
He's yummy, isn't he, Bren?
Yeah, positively.

41:31.288 --> 41:34.708
It's Miss you want, isn't it?

41:34.709 --> 41:36.459
Well...

41:36.460 --> 41:39.379
Yeah, but that's not happening.

41:39.380 --> 41:42.465
Well, why don't we finish you off?

41:42.466 --> 41:44.968
What?

41:44.969 --> 41:46.845
Uh, now?

41:46.846 --> 41:48.430
Yeah.

41:48.431 --> 41:50.306
Oh!

41:50.307 --> 41:52.309
Wait, wait, wait.
What-what?

41:53.310 --> 41:55.311
That kind of feels...
Yeah?

41:55.312 --> 41:57.480
It feels like an ambush here.

41:57.481 --> 41:59.190
It is.
You know?

41:59.191 --> 42:01.484
It's a honey drop.

42:01.485 --> 42:03.487
Yeah?

42:24.008 --> 42:26.051
Tell me what you want.

42:26.052 --> 42:29.804
What would you like?

42:29.805 --> 42:31.390
Okay, relax.

42:45.529 --> 42:48.490
So you had the camera?

42:48.491 --> 42:52.536
This card has time
code September 6.

42:55.206 --> 42:58.918
You must've been recording
her first flush of love.

43:01.128 --> 43:03.422
Can't be much fun for you.

43:06.509 --> 43:08.302
No.

43:33.035 --> 43:36.037
<i>The three of us are
stuck love struck</i>

43:36.038 --> 43:38.874
<i>Never know who to trust
or when I've had enough</i>

43:38.916 --> 43:41.584
<i>What do we do when we're
through all the broken rules</i>

43:41.585 --> 43:45.004
<i>Am I just a fool for the
drama that comes up?</i>

43:45.005 --> 43:47.841
<i>A single kiss, a narrow miss</i>

43:47.842 --> 43:51.052
<i>The bullet and the target
is the hardest to hit</i>

43:51.053 --> 43:55.558
<i>I should quit but I can't
get you outta my head</i>

43:59.437 --> 44:01.438
pretty good with a gun.

44:01.439 --> 44:03.899
Call me the Bonnie to your Clyde.

44:07.945 --> 44:10.363
<i>What do I do?</i>

44:10.364 --> 44:13.909
<i>I'm stuck in the middle
of the moth and her flame</i>

44:15.161 --> 44:18.080
<i>Waitin' for a new day
that never comes</i>

44:20.124 --> 44:22.167
<i>What do I do?</i>

44:22.168 --> 44:26.046
<i>I'm stuck in the middle
of the moth and her flame</i>

44:26.047 --> 44:30.258
<i>Playing games, waitin'
for a new day</i>

44:30.259 --> 44:32.927
<i>That never comes</i>

44:32.928 --> 44:34.304
<i>Please wait</i>

44:34.305 --> 44:36.097
<i>Think about tomorrow</i>

44:36.098 --> 44:39.142
<i>And the next girl</i>
<i>that he's gonna follow</i>

44:39.143 --> 44:41.895
<i>I can take care of you</i>

44:41.896 --> 44:44.522
<i>Do dares with you
play fair with you</i>

44:44.523 --> 44:47.150
<i>Anywhere you choose</i>
<i>anywhere you choose</i>

44:47.151 --> 44:50.528
<i>I'll follow your rules to</i>
<i>the ends of the earth</i>

44:50.529 --> 44:54.491
<i>Even if it means</i>
<i>I'm the one who gets hurt...</i>

44:54.492 --> 44:56.201
<i>Even if it means...</i>

44:56.202 --> 44:58.119
<i>What do I do?</i>

44:58.120 --> 45:02.124
<i>I'm stuck in the middle of</i>
<i>the moth and her flame</i>

45:02.166 --> 45:05.335
<i>Waitin' for a new day</i>

45:05.336 --> 45:07.129
<i>that never comes</i>

45:08.089 --> 45:09.923
<i>What do I do?</i>

45:09.924 --> 45:15.053
<i>I'm stuck in the middle of</i>
<i>the moth and her flame</i>

45:15.054 --> 45:17.138
listen, mate, um,

45:17.139 --> 45:21.017
could we get you to leave
us alone for a minute?

45:21.018 --> 45:22.520
Yeah.

45:27.066 --> 45:30.694
Might need that.

45:30.695 --> 45:33.405
Oh, right. See you
in a couple of hours.

45:33.406 --> 45:36.075
All right.

45:40.121 --> 45:43.540
Oh, you are so ridiculously hot.

45:43.541 --> 45:45.584
<i>What do I do?</i>

45:49.505 --> 45:52.049
<i>What do I do?</i>

45:56.387 --> 45:58.597
<i>What do I do?</i>

46:04.562 --> 46:08.106
But you weren't in the room?
No.

46:08.107 --> 46:10.026
You watched it later?

46:11.027 --> 46:12.569
Well, yeah.

46:12.570 --> 46:16.615
She knew you would.
I guess so.

46:18.576 --> 46:24.205
How would you feel about Dennis Hoge going
to jail for the murder of Missy Dembree?

46:24.206 --> 46:28.710
Well, that's what happens
when you commit a crime, right?

46:28.711 --> 46:30.587
What the hell?

46:30.588 --> 46:32.589
Whoops. Just testing
your athleticism.

46:32.590 --> 46:35.134
Stop fucking around, mate.

46:46.145 --> 46:48.147
Come on, I dare you.

46:56.322 --> 47:00.033
- Found a watch.
- This doesn't look good, Dennis.

47:00.034 --> 47:04.412
Breaking and entering, theft.
You being a championship player and all.

47:04.413 --> 47:06.540
Yeah, no shit.

47:07.458 --> 47:09.334
Are you nuts?

47:09.335 --> 47:11.628
Here's the real dare, Dennis.

47:11.629 --> 47:13.630
You're gonna call Casey.

47:13.631 --> 47:16.633
You're gonna tell her
the truth about Missy.

47:16.634 --> 47:19.135
You're gonna tell her that you lied

47:19.136 --> 47:22.138
and that you got Missy
pregnant and broke her heart.

47:22.139 --> 47:23.807
Oh, boo-fucking-hoo.

47:23.808 --> 47:26.309
Not a chance. That's mine.
It's not even loaded.

47:26.310 --> 47:31.648
That was really cute, how you kept
the bullets with the condoms, right?

47:31.649 --> 47:35.694
Little extra protection, even though everybody
knows you don't use anything at all.

47:35.695 --> 47:38.114
You love her, Mike. Say it.

47:38.155 --> 47:40.783
But she doesn't love you back. All you're
gonna get from her is conversation.

47:40.784 --> 47:42.827
Shut up!
Mike, he doesn't know anything about us.

47:42.828 --> 47:44.661
Give me the cell phone.
I'm gonna call Casey.

47:44.687 --> 47:47.789
That's not happening.
Put down the gun, Mike.

47:47.790 --> 47:50.710
- Let go of me.
- Let her go. Let her go!

48:01.387 --> 48:03.304
Suicide.

48:03.305 --> 48:06.183
That's our story.
It will keep you out of jail.

48:07.518 --> 48:09.686
Why would Missy kill herself?

48:09.687 --> 48:11.730
She's mad jealous about Casey.

48:11.731 --> 48:13.815
Some sick form of revenge, I guess.

48:13.816 --> 48:16.693
I can think of easier forms.

48:16.694 --> 48:19.863
She was a stalker.
She was calling me,

48:19.864 --> 48:22.323
my Agent, the press.

48:22.324 --> 48:25.785
Trying to get to Casey,
tell 'em all sorts of shit.

48:25.786 --> 48:28.288
That she was pregnant
with your child?

48:28.289 --> 48:32.834
Exactly. It's all lies.
I wouldn't be that stupid.

48:32.835 --> 48:34.879
No.

48:36.881 --> 48:39.299
Why? What did Mike tell you?

48:39.300 --> 48:42.844
- Oh, he said you shot her.
- That's fucking insane. No fucking way.

48:42.845 --> 48:46.514
It wasn't a suicide,
was it, Dennis?

48:46.515 --> 48:48.725
She had marks on her neck and arms.

48:48.726 --> 48:51.686
Signs of bruising. Plus we know you
called Casey Cass from the hotel.

48:51.687 --> 48:54.356
If you want, I can get her down
and we can talk to her right now.

48:54.357 --> 48:59.361
No, don't do that, please.
Or I can keep all of this quiet.

48:59.362 --> 49:02.906
Your game's up, superstar. You lie to
me now, you're in deep shit or worse.

49:02.907 --> 49:05.408
You're on trial for fucking murder.

49:05.409 --> 49:07.244
Shit.

49:09.872 --> 49:11.916
It was an accident.

49:12.917 --> 49:15.877
Mike... thought it was a bluff.

49:15.878 --> 49:18.254
The gun wasn't
supposed to be loaded.

49:18.255 --> 49:21.341
He wrestled it away from Missy.

49:21.342 --> 49:24.469
Blam, it went off.
He shot her.

49:24.470 --> 49:27.932
But it was an accident.

49:29.600 --> 49:31.643
Dennis said it was an accident.

49:31.644 --> 49:33.895
Dennis said

49:33.896 --> 49:37.274
the gun was in Mike's hand,
and it just went off.

49:40.444 --> 49:41.945
I wasn't there, but...

49:41.946 --> 49:44.740
I don't think Mike does
anything accidentally.

49:44.782 --> 49:45.949
He's too anal.

49:45.950 --> 49:48.785
So you think he meant to kill her?

49:48.786 --> 49:52.580
No. Doesn't add up.

49:52.581 --> 49:54.750
He loved her too much.

49:54.792 --> 49:58.962
Maybe sometimes loving someone
too much can be dangerous.

49:58.963 --> 50:01.465
Maybe.

50:03.843 --> 50:06.887
Wake up, Mike.
I think it's your turn.

50:10.725 --> 50:14.394
Oh, come...

50:14.395 --> 50:17.939
"Explain your first experience.
Describe your first lover."

50:17.940 --> 50:19.983
Tell us, Mike.

50:19.984 --> 50:24.280
Yeah, give us the details.

50:25.531 --> 50:27.407
Okay, I was...
High School.

50:27.408 --> 50:29.993
I was dating this girl, Julie Tate.

50:29.994 --> 50:32.954
We were in a theater group,

50:32.955 --> 50:35.999
performing at this
weekend festival, and...

50:36.000 --> 50:38.794
"there are daggers in men's smiles,

50:38.836 --> 50:41.963
the near in blood,
the nearer bloody."

50:41.964 --> 50:45.383
- I like that.
- She was this super-hot lady MacBeth,

50:45.384 --> 50:47.803
and we managed to do it

50:47.845 --> 50:49.805
backstage standing up
in tights and these

50:49.847 --> 50:52.349
big renaissance velvet robes, so...

50:52.350 --> 50:55.643
Whoo!
Yeah.

50:55.644 --> 50:58.730
That's really sweet, but,
um, something's telling me

50:58.731 --> 51:01.691
that you are a...
a liar.

51:01.692 --> 51:03.526
I thought you would back me up.

51:03.527 --> 51:06.655
What are you, embarrassed?
Come on, just tell us, dude.

51:06.697 --> 51:09.657
It's true. It's true.
You did do it with Julie,

51:09.658 --> 51:13.411
but... I was
your first lover.

51:13.412 --> 51:15.497
You're kid...

51:15.498 --> 51:17.999
Mike, why didn't you tell
me that? Come on.

51:18.000 --> 51:19.835
I was trying to protect you.

51:19.877 --> 51:22.379
I don't need protecting.

51:22.380 --> 51:26.883
Okay, fine. Katie and I have
been friends since we were kids.

51:26.884 --> 51:30.053
Just play dates and birthdays
and later, yearbook club.

51:30.054 --> 51:31.889
We were just really good
friends in High School,

51:31.890 --> 51:36.434
and one night we had a few
beers and stumbled into more.

51:36.435 --> 51:40.397
Yeah, and you know what?
It kind of actually looked

51:40.398 --> 51:42.691
a little something like this.

51:42.692 --> 51:45.902
Oh. Okay.

51:45.903 --> 51:47.737
I think they get it, Katie.

51:47.738 --> 51:49.489
Fine, fine. Whatever.

51:49.490 --> 51:51.867
My parents walked in, and
it was coitus interruptus.

51:51.868 --> 51:55.705
Yes, which is why we have
been friends ever since.

51:55.746 --> 51:58.456
That means we just caught you in a lie.
Get up and sing.

51:58.457 --> 52:01.335
Mm. It's not bad.

52:02.795 --> 52:07.632
<i>525,600 minutes</i>

52:07.633 --> 52:10.886
<i>525,000</i>

52:10.928 --> 52:12.847
<i>moments so dear</i>

52:19.103 --> 52:20.937
I have a question for you.

52:20.938 --> 52:24.441
Did Mike give you his camera when
you were at the fire escape?

52:24.442 --> 52:26.110
Be careful.

52:28.487 --> 52:30.865
Yeah, I think so.

52:32.116 --> 52:34.784
What is it with you students?

52:34.785 --> 52:37.121
I mean, how bored must you be?

52:39.498 --> 52:41.500
Way bored.

52:46.505 --> 52:50.926
Trouble is, life's mostly
false when you're sober.

52:50.968 --> 52:54.471
I mean, we're all liars.

52:54.472 --> 52:55.931
Behaving well,

52:55.973 --> 52:58.433
seeking the approval of parents,

52:58.434 --> 53:00.144
teachers, peers.

53:01.645 --> 53:03.646
The truth only comes out when you

53:03.647 --> 53:05.523
shed the inhibitions,

53:05.524 --> 53:07.150
take a risk.

53:07.151 --> 53:09.652
So, are you lying now?

53:09.653 --> 53:12.490
Nope.

53:22.166 --> 53:24.502
I told you Mike had this
awful crush on Missy, right?

53:24.503 --> 53:27.962
Well, I guess he agreed
to help her use this game

53:27.963 --> 53:30.549
to get between me and Casey.

53:31.717 --> 53:33.927
Thank you.

53:33.928 --> 53:35.845
But, I mean, it wasn't his fault.

53:35.846 --> 53:39.182
She stole my gun and brought it
along for this stupid game of hers.

53:39.183 --> 53:41.644
That'll help his case.

53:41.686 --> 53:44.145
Then she pointed it
at me, threatening.

53:44.146 --> 53:46.189
Said she wanted to destroy me.

53:46.190 --> 53:48.733
She was trying to get
between me and Casey.

53:48.734 --> 53:50.568
Was Mike filming at the time?

53:50.569 --> 53:53.072
No, not at the hotel.

53:57.159 --> 54:00.079
How did this whole thing end
between you and Missy?

54:03.499 --> 54:05.041
I broke up with her,

54:05.042 --> 54:07.168
but she was in total denial.

54:07.169 --> 54:12.007
She kept coming round
at all hours, stalking.

54:12.049 --> 54:14.092
And then when news of
my engagement to Casey

54:14.093 --> 54:16.720
hit the press, she just snapped.

54:16.721 --> 54:19.015
Perhaps she thought she was
the one, poor sausage.

54:19.056 --> 54:23.978
I never told her that, I swear.
We were just having a bit of fun.

54:31.902 --> 54:33.653
Fuck! How did
you find us?

54:33.654 --> 54:35.531
Oh, I'm sorry.
You don't think Casey knows me?

54:35.532 --> 54:38.241
We have so much in common, don't we?
You fucking stalker.

54:38.242 --> 54:40.618
I will call you, I promise.
Oh, right, right.

54:40.619 --> 54:43.831
Just like you promised the last
time and the time before that?

54:47.209 --> 54:49.045
Shh!

54:51.088 --> 54:53.049
If you don't let go of me,

54:53.090 --> 54:56.510
I swear to God I'll scream.

55:05.061 --> 55:07.146
How fucking dare you?

55:11.901 --> 55:14.070
This is not over.

55:20.910 --> 55:22.285
Hey.

55:22.286 --> 55:25.747
What is it?
Oh, nothing. I just, uh...

55:25.748 --> 55:28.000
I had nerves in my stomach.
Had to step out for some air.

55:28.001 --> 55:30.668
Um, can I talk to you for a second?

55:30.669 --> 55:32.254
Um...

55:32.296 --> 55:36.092
Um, I've never had
a home like this.

55:36.133 --> 55:38.093
I've mostly grown up alone,

55:38.094 --> 55:42.098
hard-done and frequently hung over.

55:42.139 --> 55:44.683
It's all a bit new to me, so...

55:44.684 --> 55:46.726
Well, I do love you.

55:46.727 --> 55:50.897
My family already loves you.
Which makes you lucky.

55:50.898 --> 55:53.317
Very lucky.

56:00.950 --> 56:03.034
I won't let anything
come between us.

56:03.035 --> 56:05.620
Promise me that.

56:05.621 --> 56:07.289
I promise.

56:09.667 --> 56:12.169
I do like the way it feels.

56:13.671 --> 56:15.631
And this too.

56:18.300 --> 56:21.052
You know, I saw you play once.

56:21.053 --> 56:23.847
At Northrup.
Great corner.

56:23.848 --> 56:26.725
Ah, you saw that?

56:26.726 --> 56:28.977
You're one hell of a striker.

56:28.978 --> 56:30.813
I do what I can.

56:30.855 --> 56:34.692
You can't take that
shot from behind bars.

56:41.198 --> 56:45.326
So tell me about the game.

56:45.327 --> 56:49.039
<i>Adolesens mendio.
That's latin for "I tell lies."</i>

56:49.040 --> 56:50.665
Whatever.

56:50.666 --> 56:52.710
Looks like it's time for
Dennis to cleanse his soul.

56:52.711 --> 56:55.755
Two raw eggs to
symbolize innocence.

56:57.381 --> 57:00.383
And a little bit of my spit.

57:00.384 --> 57:04.180
You know, a little accusation
before your redemption.

57:04.221 --> 57:06.348
You are making this up as you go.

57:06.349 --> 57:08.767
Is that why I came here, Missy?

57:08.768 --> 57:10.810
To cleanse my soul?

57:10.811 --> 57:14.773
Oh, I don't think
that'll do it, Dennis.

57:14.774 --> 57:16.275
Did you see that?

57:18.027 --> 57:21.030
Are you okay?
Yeah, sure.

57:21.072 --> 57:24.283
I feel born again.
Clean, like.

57:26.202 --> 57:29.080
Oh, that's gross,

57:35.252 --> 57:38.046
Dennis? Dennis?

57:38.047 --> 57:40.299
What the fuck?

58:02.113 --> 58:06.366
- All right. Billy. Billy.
- Nice to meet you.

58:06.367 --> 58:10.120
D-man, d-licious, d-lightful.

58:10.121 --> 58:13.456
We're actually all right.
Yeah, man. Very good.

58:13.457 --> 58:15.458
Come here for a second.

58:15.459 --> 58:17.920
I'm rolling on the "E" train
is what's going on here.

58:17.921 --> 58:20.463
You've got something...
Oh, that feels so good right there.

58:20.464 --> 58:23.007
Right, yeah.
Just like that. You know.

58:23.008 --> 58:25.051
Right, did you bring the...

58:25.052 --> 58:26.469
Yeah, yeah. Right here.

58:26.470 --> 58:29.098
Sorry, man. Got a little caught up.

58:29.140 --> 58:30.349
Oh, is that all you brought me?

58:30.350 --> 58:32.852
"Is that all"?
I like that.

58:34.437 --> 58:40.025
Hey, check it out.
Lead cock going on here.

58:40.026 --> 58:43.153
I mean, I'm a lapsed catholic,
but I got to believe...

58:43.154 --> 58:47.032
You've got to believe in something or
someone. Otherwise, what's the point?

58:47.033 --> 58:50.869
You all think too much.

58:50.870 --> 58:52.371
That's the antidote.

58:54.415 --> 58:56.833
That's naughty.

58:56.834 --> 58:59.754
Strong-arm.

59:04.467 --> 59:05.801
So stupid!

59:09.805 --> 59:11.014
Shit. Sorry.

59:11.015 --> 59:13.516
Hey, what's the matter?

59:13.517 --> 59:16.144
I just thought that, um,

59:16.145 --> 59:17.812
Mike and I would finally...

59:17.813 --> 59:20.523
No, no, no. He's an idiot.
Stay with me.

59:20.524 --> 59:23.561
I thought you were engaged
to this Casey Cass.

59:23.587 --> 59:26.529
No, I am. Yeah, but
we're not married.

59:26.530 --> 59:29.240
All right, look. See, uh,

59:29.241 --> 59:31.493
Katie has a thing for Mike,

59:31.494 --> 59:34.871
and maybe she was just
using me to get to him,

59:34.872 --> 59:37.457
I don't know, but things got messy.

59:37.458 --> 59:39.501
What? No. No, no, no.
Come here, come here.

59:39.502 --> 59:41.379
Just for a second.
Come on. Come on.

59:41.380 --> 59:44.340
We're just swaying to the music.
That's fine.

59:44.382 --> 59:46.925
You're all right.

59:46.926 --> 59:49.177
Have a little dance.

59:49.178 --> 59:51.430
There it is.

59:53.140 --> 59:56.101
- Don't.
- Katie, come on. What's the matter?

59:56.102 --> 59:59.229
You can't just grab what you
want. You're such a dick head.

59:59.230 --> 01:00:01.231
I'm a dick head?

01:00:01.232 --> 01:00:05.276
All right. You might make him jealous,
you know. He always wants what I have.

01:00:05.277 --> 01:00:07.570
God, arrogant much? You...

01:00:07.571 --> 01:00:09.948
tell you what.
You let me touch you in three

01:00:09.949 --> 01:00:12.034
perfectly appropriate places,

01:00:12.076 --> 01:00:15.955
and if you still don't want a kiss, I
will let you walk away un-harrassed.

01:01:00.624 --> 01:01:02.500
- Don't.
- What... what's the matter?

01:01:02.501 --> 01:01:03.627
- No, just...
- Katie, what...

01:01:03.628 --> 01:01:05.628
- Just stop it!
- Katie?

01:01:05.629 --> 01:01:08.924
- Katie, are you sure you don't want company?
- Did he hurt you?

01:01:10.343 --> 01:01:13.011
Back off.

01:01:13.012 --> 01:01:14.387
Easy, mate.

01:01:14.388 --> 01:01:17.266
Just warming her up for you.

01:01:17.308 --> 01:01:19.935
You are such an ass.

01:01:32.114 --> 01:01:36.118
Casey's not enough, huh? Missy?
You got to have everyone?

01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:38.453
You're lucky I don't just end you.

01:01:38.454 --> 01:01:41.040
- Yeah, lucky.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, hey.

01:01:43.084 --> 01:01:45.210
What's going on? You okay?

01:01:45.211 --> 01:01:47.670
What just happened?

01:01:47.671 --> 01:01:50.215
- What happened? Are you okay?
- Are you all right?

01:01:50.216 --> 01:01:54.303
- Yeah.
- Fuckin' asshole.

01:01:54.345 --> 01:01:56.681
Oh, God.

01:02:02.687 --> 01:02:05.230
Come here, give me a kiss.

01:02:05.231 --> 01:02:08.693
Oh, my God!

01:02:09.985 --> 01:02:11.569
Gotcha!

01:02:11.570 --> 01:02:15.156
- All right.
- Oh, my God.

01:02:15.157 --> 01:02:18.243
Hey, sorry about earlier.
Maybe it's just you and I.

01:02:18.244 --> 01:02:19.703
Yeah, I'm sober now.

01:02:19.704 --> 01:02:22.539
Dennis, my darling sexy-face.
Are you going?

01:02:22.540 --> 01:02:26.168
Thanks for a wonderful pre-party.
You're absolutely welcome.

01:02:26.210 --> 01:02:28.712
All right, all right. Have a
good time, mate. Come on.

01:02:28.713 --> 01:02:32.340
Just give me a kiss, all right?
No. Don't think so.

01:02:32.341 --> 01:02:34.092
He's mine.

01:02:34.093 --> 01:02:38.014
It was a party. Everyone was
getting really excited, and...

01:02:40.558 --> 01:02:43.101
Now who's staring?

01:02:43.102 --> 01:02:45.521
Things happened.

01:02:52.570 --> 01:02:55.531
<i>Just Mike, Katie and Missy.
Come on.</i>

01:02:55.573 --> 01:02:58.617
<i>Billy was there too,
but he was tied up.</i>

01:03:51.337 --> 01:03:54.173
So tell me about this threesome.

01:03:57.635 --> 01:03:59.552
<i>It was Dennis,</i>

01:03:59.553 --> 01:04:01.806
<i>Katie and Missy.</i>

01:04:14.402 --> 01:04:17.822
Cut me loose.

01:04:39.844 --> 01:04:43.597
It's all right, Katie.
We've got you.

01:04:44.515 --> 01:04:46.642
Wait. Wait.

01:04:50.312 --> 01:04:54.608
Guys, she's scared.
Help.

01:05:10.833 --> 01:05:12.668
What are you actually
charging me with?

01:05:12.669 --> 01:05:14.670
Drug use, reckless endangerment,
breaking and entering,

01:05:14.712 --> 01:05:17.672
and that's all, to start with.
Did you tell him the truth?

01:05:17.673 --> 01:05:20.259
I did.
Your loss.

01:05:21.469 --> 01:05:23.303
Hey, premier league.

01:05:23.304 --> 01:05:25.723
This is exactly the kind of
press that can kill a career.

01:05:25.724 --> 01:05:29.809
It's your gun, victim's blood on
your shirt, big, fat fucking motive.

01:05:29.810 --> 01:05:32.772
- Fuck you.
- Fuck me? No, fuck you.

01:05:39.779 --> 01:05:43.887
Did Mike hate Dennis enough to play
along with Missy's little game?

01:05:46.577 --> 01:05:50.664
I think Mike would do
anything Missy asked.

01:05:52.458 --> 01:05:56.522
Dennis destroyed her by falling for Casey,
and she wanted to destroy him right back.

01:06:02.218 --> 01:06:03.886
May I?

01:06:05.930 --> 01:06:07.682
Oh.

01:06:13.729 --> 01:06:15.605
Who did that?

01:06:15.606 --> 01:06:20.235
It was stupid. It was just a dare. Really.
I just played along.

01:06:20.236 --> 01:06:21.319
Who was it?

01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:23.823
Missy.

01:06:26.325 --> 01:06:28.326
Was Mike there?

01:06:28.327 --> 01:06:30.329
No.

01:06:31.580 --> 01:06:33.289
But Dennis was.

01:06:33.290 --> 01:06:36.752
Wait. Wait.
Shit. Guys, she's scared.

01:06:43.634 --> 01:06:44.968
Oh, God.

01:06:44.969 --> 01:06:47.930
Come on, beauty cans.
It's just a game.

01:06:54.979 --> 01:06:57.732
Oh, yeah.

01:07:03.779 --> 01:07:05.655
Well? What happened?

01:07:05.656 --> 01:07:07.867
It was a little anticlimactic.

01:07:13.372 --> 01:07:15.833
I need a drink.

01:07:22.006 --> 01:07:23.841
We found Mike and Dennis' prints,

01:07:23.842 --> 01:07:28.012
but we could only get a partial...
not enough for Missy.

01:07:29.722 --> 01:07:32.849
What are you saying?
Were you ever in Dennis' bedroom?

01:07:32.850 --> 01:07:34.513
Yeah, briefly.

01:07:34.539 --> 01:07:37.404
Is there anything you'd
like to tell me about that?

01:07:39.565 --> 01:07:41.399
Did you ever hold this gun?

01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:45.487
No. I didn't.

01:07:45.488 --> 01:07:49.825
You didn't like Missy, did you?
Why was that?

01:07:49.867 --> 01:07:53.661
I didn't like the hypnotic

01:07:53.662 --> 01:07:56.040
hold that she had over Mike.

01:07:57.583 --> 01:07:59.502
The manipulation.

01:07:59.543 --> 01:08:03.004
He always made her out
to be such a princess.

01:08:03.005 --> 01:08:05.590
And she wasn't?

01:08:05.591 --> 01:08:08.760
Look,

01:08:08.761 --> 01:08:10.762
I'm no prize,

01:08:10.763 --> 01:08:13.057
but Missy, man,

01:08:14.433 --> 01:08:16.852
she was like poison.

01:08:18.354 --> 01:08:20.604
She had this whole

01:08:20.606 --> 01:08:24.067
artsy, black-as-death thing.

01:08:24.068 --> 01:08:26.778
Self-destructive, needy,

01:08:26.779 --> 01:08:29.988
"kiss me, love me, hurt me."

01:08:29.990 --> 01:08:33.452
I don't know, but
the guys ate it up.

01:08:51.804 --> 01:08:54.098
You can't teach that.

01:09:23.836 --> 01:09:26.964
What about Dennis?
Were you into him?

01:09:28.674 --> 01:09:31.051
Sort of.

01:09:31.051 --> 01:09:33.845
Quintessential bad boy.
You know the type?

01:09:33.845 --> 01:09:35.930
Regrettably.

01:09:42.104 --> 01:09:44.481
So Dennis tells me that

01:09:44.482 --> 01:09:47.526
you two almost got together.

01:09:48.652 --> 01:09:51.821
<i>I was high.</i>

01:09:51.822 --> 01:09:54.491
<i>Almost made a big mistake.</i>

01:09:54.492 --> 01:09:56.410
<i>Almost.</i>

01:10:05.586 --> 01:10:08.130
You don't mind me despising you?

01:10:10.841 --> 01:10:14.094
What stopped you?
All your life,

01:10:14.095 --> 01:10:17.555
people tell you about your...

01:10:17.556 --> 01:10:20.433
Potential,

01:10:20.434 --> 01:10:22.185
your...

01:10:22.186 --> 01:10:24.729
Brains,

01:10:24.730 --> 01:10:27.607
your beauty,

01:10:27.608 --> 01:10:30.569
and you want it all to be true.

01:10:32.196 --> 01:10:36.450
And then you go off to college
with all that in your head.

01:10:37.159 --> 01:10:39.954
Your freedom to find it.

01:10:42.873 --> 01:10:45.209
But it doesn't come easily.

01:10:47.586 --> 01:10:51.590
And... it's lonely.

01:10:53.592 --> 01:10:56.011
And...

01:10:56.012 --> 01:11:00.181
And you don't want
to tell anyone that

01:11:00.182 --> 01:11:02.226
you're failing

01:11:03.936 --> 01:11:06.480
or how scared you are.

01:11:09.775 --> 01:11:12.193
Then...

01:11:12.194 --> 01:11:15.739
Someone touches this button deep,

01:11:15.740 --> 01:11:19.242
deep inside which says,

01:11:19.243 --> 01:11:23.246
"it's okay to compromise.

01:11:23.247 --> 01:11:26.583
"It's okay to at least

01:11:26.584 --> 01:11:29.085
"feel good,

01:11:29.086 --> 01:11:31.589
to feel wanted."

01:11:35.801 --> 01:11:38.220
You fear you may lose yourself.

01:11:40.639 --> 01:11:42.640
But with the right touch

01:11:42.641 --> 01:11:44.934
on the right night

01:11:44.935 --> 01:11:49.272
in the right fog of
chemically induced delirium,

01:11:49.273 --> 01:11:52.276
the pleasure seems worth the pain,

01:11:53.652 --> 01:11:56.655
and you risk it.

01:12:00.284 --> 01:12:04.913
Did you hear me? I said, "if you
keep going, I'll hate you."

01:12:04.914 --> 01:12:08.708
Why would I care?

01:12:08.709 --> 01:12:12.254
Because you're part of the human
race, you soulless degenerate.

01:12:12.296 --> 01:12:15.549
Uh-huh. That's right.
Pleasure me.

01:12:16.759 --> 01:12:19.636
You have to have some
moral obligation.

01:12:19.637 --> 01:12:22.932
Saddam Hussein started
out drowning cats.

01:12:22.973 --> 01:12:24.891
All right. Fuck it.
Seriously.

01:12:24.892 --> 01:12:28.687
And he killed people because
they too were an inconvenience.

01:12:28.688 --> 01:12:30.689
Saddam?

01:12:30.690 --> 01:12:33.275
I'm not fucking drowning cats.

01:12:35.986 --> 01:12:39.030
But you are.

01:12:39.031 --> 01:12:41.991
Come here. You're
an overeducated cunt.

01:12:41.992 --> 01:12:44.161
Educate this!

01:12:51.335 --> 01:12:54.171
You know, Katie, you're the
first American I've ever liked.

01:12:55.339 --> 01:12:58.718
Maybe that's 'cause
I'm from Canada.

01:13:03.806 --> 01:13:06.141
Did Missy ever return
Mike's affection?

01:13:06.142 --> 01:13:09.060
Sex, you mean?

01:13:09.061 --> 01:13:12.272
I... I don't know.

01:13:12.273 --> 01:13:14.774
She had the hook in him deep.

01:13:14.775 --> 01:13:18.361
Kept pretending one day
she'd finally reel him in.

01:13:18.362 --> 01:13:20.989
Do you think Dennis would go
to the extent of killing Missy

01:13:20.990 --> 01:13:23.074
just to protect his own...

01:13:23.075 --> 01:13:25.326
Interests, his future?

01:13:25.327 --> 01:13:28.748
Is that what Mike said?
You go first.

01:13:31.083 --> 01:13:33.293
I mean, I don't know.

01:13:33.294 --> 01:13:36.046
Seems nothing is more important

01:13:36.047 --> 01:13:39.759
to Dennis than Dennis.

01:14:00.988 --> 01:14:02.406
We found the camera empty.

01:14:02.407 --> 01:14:05.200
So, the way I see it,

01:14:05.201 --> 01:14:07.370
either that means,
Mike, that you opted

01:14:07.411 --> 01:14:10.373
not to shoot footage in the hotel,

01:14:10.414 --> 01:14:13.042
because that would've
been evidence,

01:14:13.084 --> 01:14:14.959
or you got rid of it.

01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:18.046
There's no footage.

01:14:18.047 --> 01:14:20.216
Is that true?

01:14:25.221 --> 01:14:27.223
I'll tell you what is true.

01:14:27.264 --> 01:14:30.809
She lied to all of you.

01:14:30.810 --> 01:14:33.353
Missy never had an abortion.

01:14:33.354 --> 01:14:35.438
Hospital has it down
as a miscarriage.

01:14:35.439 --> 01:14:38.233
And I'll tell you what
else we found out too.

01:14:38.234 --> 01:14:42.445
Her mother was institutionalized
for most of her life.

01:14:42.446 --> 01:14:44.989
Missy herself was on
lithium and tegretol,

01:14:44.990 --> 01:14:47.283
which are both prescribed
for manic depression.

01:14:47.284 --> 01:14:50.286
She also tried to
kill herself twice:

01:14:50.287 --> 01:14:54.083
Once with an overdose of paracetamol;
Another time with something much sharper:

01:14:54.125 --> 01:14:55.917
A knife.

01:14:55.918 --> 01:14:58.878
That doesn't change the fact
that Dennis killed her.

01:14:58.879 --> 01:15:01.464
There's more than one way to
do that, right? He broke her.

01:15:01.465 --> 01:15:03.426
Blaming him won't
bring her back, Mike.

01:15:03.427 --> 01:15:05.845
Yeah, give it up, mate. Sit down.

01:15:07.138 --> 01:15:10.391
I think Missy wanted
Dennis to watch her die.

01:15:12.309 --> 01:15:16.146
She didn't dream of that,
Mike. She planned it.

01:15:16.147 --> 01:15:19.941
Think about it. She
set up the dare.

01:15:19.942 --> 01:15:25.113
Loading the gun, leaving Dennis'
shirt behind as evidence.

01:15:25.114 --> 01:15:29.452
It was a suicide, and she wanted
Dennis to take the blame.

01:15:31.871 --> 01:15:34.290
Mike?

01:15:38.878 --> 01:15:42.298
Yeah. Okay.

01:15:49.764 --> 01:15:51.891
Hello?

01:15:57.897 --> 01:15:59.898
What are you doing?

01:15:59.899 --> 01:16:02.526
Missy?

01:16:07.865 --> 01:16:10.992
You have no idea how
much I love you, Dennis.

01:16:10.993 --> 01:16:15.830
And if you don't want to be with me, I'm
gonna make this really easy on both of us.

01:16:15.831 --> 01:16:17.541
Missy, no.

01:16:24.924 --> 01:16:26.842
Oh, God!

01:16:28.844 --> 01:16:30.846
Oh, God!

01:16:33.265 --> 01:16:35.266
I'm gonna tell 'em you shot her.

01:16:35.267 --> 01:16:37.546
That's what she wanted...
to destroy you!

01:16:37.572 --> 01:16:41.841
What? Fuck that. You're
the love-struck Romeo.

01:16:42.942 --> 01:16:47.446
What's going on? Open up.

01:17:46.172 --> 01:17:48.924
Easy, mate.

01:18:02.438 --> 01:18:04.439
I wanted you all to remember this

01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:07.568
next time you're
looking for a thrill.

01:18:44.271 --> 01:18:46.649
What the hell, Dennis?
You let her into your house?

01:18:46.650 --> 01:18:49.234
No, she broke in, all right?
She's a stalker.

01:18:49.235 --> 01:18:53.154
Jesus, what would my parents say?
And she was pregnant?

01:18:53.155 --> 01:18:57.075
It's not... Could we talk
about this outside, please?

01:18:57.076 --> 01:19:00.203
Okay, so you are

01:19:00.204 --> 01:19:02.164
both free to go.

01:19:06.502 --> 01:19:08.504
Are you here for long?

01:19:08.546 --> 01:19:10.672
Yeah, I think I'm gonna...

01:19:10.673 --> 01:19:12.716
I'm gonna stay for a bit.

01:19:12.717 --> 01:19:15.218
Just kind of tour by myself

01:19:15.219 --> 01:19:17.595
and clear my head.

01:19:17.596 --> 01:19:20.683
That's a good idea.
Take care of yourself.

01:19:20.725 --> 01:19:23.644
Okay.
Thank you.

01:19:29.275 --> 01:19:31.610
I'm gonna go over there.

01:19:40.661 --> 01:19:44.122
You know, I would've
loved to have met her.

01:19:44.123 --> 01:19:46.416
Yeah.

01:19:46.417 --> 01:19:51.547
Yeah, I think that she would've
said the truth is hard to come by.

01:19:53.215 --> 01:19:56.009
Yeah, but we'd all be lost
without it, wouldn't we?

01:19:56.010 --> 01:19:57.720
I suppose.

01:19:58.763 --> 01:20:02.390
So what are you doing now?
Back to college?

01:20:02.391 --> 01:20:06.394
Um... yeah.
One more year.

01:20:06.395 --> 01:20:08.647
You might like this.

01:20:10.483 --> 01:20:13.069
There's one card still inside.

01:20:14.528 --> 01:20:17.114
Smart girl, that Missy.

01:20:18.449 --> 01:20:20.659
Good luck.

01:20:36.634 --> 01:20:39.511
Dennis deserved so much worse.

01:20:39.512 --> 01:20:41.429
I know you loved her,

01:20:41.430 --> 01:20:45.183
but you can't save someone who
doesn't want to be saved.

01:20:45.184 --> 01:20:47.561
Yeah, I guess not.

01:20:49.188 --> 01:20:51.816
She should've been mine.

01:20:53.067 --> 01:20:54.610
What?

01:20:56.570 --> 01:20:59.197
Missy left one card.

01:20:59.198 --> 01:21:01.826
What does it say?

01:21:07.832 --> 01:21:11.127
"What would it take
for you to kill someone?"

01:21:15.506 --> 01:21:19.176
She knew exactly what
it would take for her.

01:21:24.140 --> 01:21:26.474
Um,

01:21:26.475 --> 01:21:28.853
will you take it?

01:21:30.146 --> 01:21:32.605
Yeah.

01:21:32.606 --> 01:21:35.151
Let's get out of here.

01:22:22.448 --> 01:22:24.784
Morning.
Good morning.

01:22:27.536 --> 01:22:29.621
Yeah, indeed.

01:22:29.622 --> 01:22:32.208
Thank you.
Mm-hmm, goodbye.

01:22:47.848 --> 01:22:51.727
I'm feeling good.
Let's play.

01:22:58.401 --> 01:23:03.238
Whose turn is it?
It's Dennis' turn.

01:23:03.239 --> 01:23:04.656
What?

01:23:04.657 --> 01:23:08.243
It should be just a
few moments, Miss.

01:23:08.244 --> 01:23:09.286
Thank you.

01:23:17.962 --> 01:23:20.338
Glad you're here, mate.

01:23:20.339 --> 01:23:23.342
Missy's party train's
gone off the fucking rails.

01:23:26.345 --> 01:23:28.263
So, are you lying now?

01:23:28.264 --> 01:23:29.974
Nope.

01:23:37.356 --> 01:23:38.983
Will you take it?

01:24:40.670 --> 01:24:43.047
Turn that camera off, Mike.

01:24:47.426 --> 01:24:49.010
Aha.

01:24:49.011 --> 01:24:51.889
<i>Found a watch.
Congrats.</i>

01:24:52.848 --> 01:24:55.517
<i>Hey, Dennis.
Yeah?</i>

01:24:55.518 --> 01:24:58.603
<i>Surprise.
The real dare starts now.</i>

01:24:58.604 --> 01:25:02.440
<i>Oh, is that true?
Oh, shit, Mike, that's my gun.</i>

01:25:02.441 --> 01:25:05.777
<i>It's not loaded.</i>

01:25:05.778 --> 01:25:08.863
<i>Actually, it is.
Miss, Miss, we...</i>

01:25:08.864 --> 01:25:11.741
<i>I'm gonna fuck your life up the
way you fucked up mine, Dennis.</i>

01:25:11.742 --> 01:25:17.580
<i>You're gonna feel the pain that I
felt and lose the way I lost.</i>

01:25:17.581 --> 01:25:20.042
<i>I got Casey's number in my phone,
and I'm gonna call her,</i>

01:25:20.043 --> 01:25:23.545
<i>and you're gonna tell her exactly what
happened between us, you lying prick.</i>

01:25:23.546 --> 01:25:26.548
That's not happening.
You should've been nicer to Mike.

01:25:26.549 --> 01:25:30.051
He might've actually
got away with this.

01:25:30.052 --> 01:25:32.513
Mike, what the... whoa, whoa,
whoa. What the fuck are you...

01:25:32.514 --> 01:25:36.100
you're not going to fuck
with me anymore, all right?

01:25:38.728 --> 01:25:40.895
<i>Mike, what the...</i>

01:25:40.896 --> 01:25:43.481
<i>this wasn't...</i>

01:25:43.482 --> 01:25:45.108
<i>bye, bye, Missy.</i>

01:25:45.109 --> 01:25:50.239
I'm not gonna help you anymore,
because you chose Dennis,

01:25:50.740 --> 01:25:52.508
not me.

01:25:55.745 --> 01:25:57.997
Game over.

01:26:03.836 --> 01:26:07.048
We were just supposed to scare her.

01:26:08.674 --> 01:26:10.800
We were just supposed
to scare her away!

01:26:10.801 --> 01:26:13.678
Don't be naive, Mike.

01:26:13.679 --> 01:26:15.930
She said she wanted to die.

01:26:15.931 --> 01:26:19.100
You have to be careful
what you wish for.

01:26:19.101 --> 01:26:21.811
- I can't believe it.
- Believe it.

01:26:21.812 --> 01:26:23.855
It's happened.

01:26:23.856 --> 01:26:27.026
It was a suicide, right? A suicide.

01:26:29.111 --> 01:26:32.448
<i>Let's get out of here.</i>

01:26:33.532 --> 01:26:36.118
<i>No.</i>

01:26:36.952 --> 01:26:39.455
Hey, Casey.
Shit.

01:28:01.620 --> 01:28:03.955
<i>Drive me insane</i>

01:28:03.956 --> 01:28:07.167
<i>but I like it</i>

01:28:07.168 --> 01:28:09.085
<i>I like it like that</i>

01:28:09.086 --> 01:28:11.921
<i>I don't need a sign</i>

01:28:11.922 --> 01:28:14.883
<i>'Cause I see it</i>

01:28:14.884 --> 01:28:17.218
<i>When I look in your eyes</i>

01:28:17.219 --> 01:28:20.013
<i>I can't explain</i>

01:28:20.014 --> 01:28:23.058
<i>but it feels good</i>

01:28:23.059 --> 01:28:25.060
<i>Feels good to me</i>

01:28:25.061 --> 01:28:27.937
<i>You drive me insane</i>

01:28:27.938 --> 01:28:30.940
<i>but I like it</i>

01:28:30.941 --> 01:28:33.234
<i>I like it like that</i>

01:28:33.235 --> 01:28:36.154
<i>This don't mean nothing</i>

01:28:36.155 --> 01:28:39.658
<i>But it could tear you apart</i>

01:28:41.243 --> 01:28:44.204
<i>This don't mean nothing</i>

01:28:44.205 --> 01:28:49.168
<i>Why is it breaking your heart</i>

01:28:59.136 --> 01:29:02.097
<i>Don't analyze</i>

01:29:02.098 --> 01:29:05.100
<i>Sometimes</i>

01:29:05.101 --> 01:29:07.268
<i>you leave me alone</i>

01:29:07.269 --> 01:29:09.938
<i>Don't ask me why</i>

01:29:09.939 --> 01:29:12.691
<i>'Cause there's no way</i>

01:29:12.692 --> 01:29:15.110
<i>No way to describe</i>

01:29:15.111 --> 01:29:20.616
<i>You drive me insane</i>

01:29:25.246 --> 01:29:28.123
<i>This don't mean nothing</i>

01:29:28.124 --> 01:29:31.627
<i>Why does it tear you apart</i>

01:29:33.295 --> 01:29:36.131
<i>This don't mean nothing</i>

01:29:36.132 --> 01:29:41.721
<i>Why does it tear you apart</i>

01:30:21.385 --> 01:30:25.096
<i>I don't care if you never get it</i>

01:30:25.097 --> 01:30:30.185
<i>It's not fair and I
never said it was</i>

01:30:30.186 --> 01:30:35.357
<i>It's just the way it is</i>

01:30:35.358 --> 01:30:38.860
<i>I won't fight it's
too late to listen</i>

01:30:38.861 --> 01:30:42.781
<i>You're not right and
I'm not a victim</i>

01:30:42.782 --> 01:30:44.199
<i>No</i>

01:30:44.200 --> 01:30:48.162
<i>It's just the way it is</i>

01:30:49.038 --> 01:30:51.414
<i>I've had enough</i>

01:30:51.415 --> 01:30:55.960
<i>I'm gonna let you go</i>

01:30:55.961 --> 01:30:59.255
<i>You can leave me now</i>

01:30:59.256 --> 01:31:03.009
<i>You can walk away
and break my heart</i>

01:31:03.010 --> 01:31:06.221
<i>I don't need you now</i>

01:31:06.222 --> 01:31:09.432
<i>Turn around and tear my world apart</i>

01:31:09.433 --> 01:31:13.228
<i>You can beg, you can cry
but I made up my mind</i>

01:31:13.229 --> 01:31:16.940
<i>There'll be no next time this time</i>

01:31:16.941 --> 01:31:19.901
<i>So just let me know</i>

01:31:19.902 --> 01:31:25.449
<i>'cause I don't want you
around to drag me down</i>
