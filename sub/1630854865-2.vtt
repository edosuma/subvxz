WEBVTT

00:09.218 --> 00:10.594
Look here for me, bud.

00:12.304 --> 00:14.348
You're gonna be okay, kid. I got you.

00:18.143 --> 00:19.144
Eddie.

00:21.396 --> 00:22.523
Eddie.

00:24.024 --> 00:25.025
Jordan?

00:27.903 --> 00:30.656
Eddie?

00:30.656 --> 00:32.698
Jordan.
-Eddie, help me.

00:32.698 --> 00:34.701
I'm coming.
-Eddie.

00:35.202 --> 00:36.745
Eddie, I'm dying.
-Don't worry.

00:40.541 --> 00:42.918
I'm coming.

00:42.918 --> 00:47.673
Help me. I'm dying.
-I'm here, Jordan. I'm here.

00:50.759 --> 00:52.427
I'm here.
-Eddie.

00:53.971 --> 00:55.055
Eddie.

01:05.607 --> 01:06.984
Eddie.
-Oh, my God.

01:06.984 --> 01:08.527
Hey, pal. Hey, stay with me, buddy.

04:34.775 --> 04:37.319
I'm gonna come around and get you.
-It's the miracle boy.

04:37.319 --> 04:39.363
Thank you. Excuse me.

04:42.574 --> 04:46.161
Please excuse me.
This is private. This is-- Excuse us.

04:46.161 --> 04:47.246
Come on, honey.

04:49.414 --> 04:50.791
It's the miracle boy.

04:51.500 --> 04:52.876
How's it feel to be home?

04:52.876 --> 04:54.378
Just ignore him, Eddie.

04:54.378 --> 04:56.755
Edward, which is it, Eddie or Edward?

04:58.465 --> 05:02.344
Eddie? Honey, we're late.

05:03.053 --> 05:05.264
Eddie. We have a table. Come on.

05:06.557 --> 05:07.766
Eddie, come on.

05:13.522 --> 05:14.523
My name is Edward.

05:38.589 --> 05:40.424
"Your lonely pilgrim."

05:43.093 --> 05:45.512
What the fuck?

05:48.015 --> 05:49.808
What the fuck?

06:19.087 --> 06:21.048
Hi. Is this the support group?

06:21.757 --> 06:22.883
Yes. Welcome.

06:26.261 --> 06:29.306
Can I tell you something before
the others get here? In confidence?

06:29.306 --> 06:30.599
Of course.

06:30.599 --> 06:32.184
I'm 16 weeks pregnant.

06:32.768 --> 06:36.230
Oh, my goodness.

06:37.439 --> 06:40.150
But my boyfriend's the only other person
in the entire world that knows,

06:40.150 --> 06:42.319
and he's dead.

06:42.319 --> 06:45.739
And my parents are toxic
and we don't actually speak.

06:45.739 --> 06:48.367
And I don't know if his parents know that
the baby exists.

06:48.367 --> 06:51.453
I actually don't know if they know
that I exist, but I have his baby.

06:52.162 --> 06:56.625
And I have a part-time job and a shitty
apartment with roommates, and like--

06:57.876 --> 07:01.421
I have no one,
and I'm wandering around the city

07:01.421 --> 07:04.675
just thinking that maybe Gary's
gonna send me a sign, which is--

07:05.467 --> 07:06.927
I'm losing my mind.

07:06.927 --> 07:11.348
And I know that this is a grief group but
I also feel like my problems are bigger.

07:13.308 --> 07:15.561
Yeah.

07:17.437 --> 07:20.983
Sorry, I don't think I belong here.
I should go.

07:21.608 --> 07:22.609
Wait, no.

07:23.193 --> 07:24.486
What's your name?

07:25.320 --> 07:26.363
Linda.

07:26.363 --> 07:29.199
Linda, listen to me. Come here.

07:30.117 --> 07:35.414
I know how you're feeling right now.
Gutted. And angry.

07:36.999 --> 07:41.962
And, you know, some days you don't even
know if you're gonna be able to go on.

07:42.796 --> 07:45.799
Listen to me, you belong here.
You absolutely belong here.

07:47.176 --> 07:48.177
Thank you.

07:50.762 --> 07:53.765
Can I hug you? Can I give you a hug?

07:55.851 --> 07:57.603
I'm a hugger.

08:12.117 --> 08:13.160
Want a cupcake?

08:13.660 --> 08:14.661
These are so good.

08:14.661 --> 08:17.122
They're the best in the tristate area.
-Okay.

08:17.122 --> 08:18.916
That's a good choice. That one is...

08:21.376 --> 08:24.505
chocolate sea salt caramel. Yeah.
-Caramel.

08:24.505 --> 08:27.049
It's so good.
-Isn't it so good?

08:27.633 --> 08:30.928
It's really good. I didn't really expect
a hug and a cupcake,

08:30.928 --> 08:33.804
but if this is therapy, I'm all in.

08:33.804 --> 08:35.557
I know.
-This is really good.

08:36.933 --> 08:38.059
Hello.

08:38.059 --> 08:41.438
Hey. Good afternoon. I'm Milo.

08:41.438 --> 08:44.066
Hi, Milo. I'm Dee Dee.

08:44.066 --> 08:45.692
Hey, Dee Dee.
-Hi.

08:46.360 --> 08:48.028
I'll be running the support group.

08:48.028 --> 08:50.113
Great. Okay.

08:50.113 --> 08:52.866
So, you're not the therapist?

08:54.076 --> 08:56.411
No, I'm not a therapist. I'm a griever.

09:25.065 --> 09:27.442
So, is this-- This is it?

09:28.110 --> 09:32.573
You're not gonna say anything?

09:33.156 --> 09:37.286
Anyone's invited to speak,
but I'm okay with the silence.

09:37.286 --> 09:38.912
So no icebreakers or--

09:38.912 --> 09:40.247
I, for one, I'm missing work.

09:40.247 --> 09:43.041
Not to mention I left Edward home
with my husband,

09:43.041 --> 09:45.836
which is basically like leaving
a 12-year-old boy alone with a man,

09:45.836 --> 09:49.047
who I love dearly,
but is also essentially a 12-year-old.

09:49.047 --> 09:53.969
Hold up. Did you say a 12-year-old
boy named Edward? Is it the Edward?

09:54.469 --> 09:56.471
Just putting two and two together here.

09:57.097 --> 09:58.348
Are you the aunt?

09:59.308 --> 10:03.270
Yeah. Yeah, that's me.
I guess I'm the aunt.

10:04.521 --> 10:06.815
Sorry the press
won't leave you guys alone.

10:08.358 --> 10:09.526
How's he doing?

10:10.694 --> 10:11.695
How are you doing?

10:16.950 --> 10:18.243
I'm dealing with it.

10:21.079 --> 10:23.040
I'm dealing with it just like we all are.

10:24.833 --> 10:26.585
People meet me and they think,

10:26.585 --> 10:30.923
"She's the woman whose nephew survived
the plane crash."

10:31.715 --> 10:33.509
But they forget I'm also...

10:39.723 --> 10:41.600
the woman who lost my big sister.

10:42.601 --> 10:43.602
And my family.

10:47.356 --> 10:50.025
So, all in all,
it's been a pretty shitty March.

11:02.871 --> 11:04.540
Hello, my niece.

11:15.133 --> 11:16.134
May I?

11:22.391 --> 11:27.479
Hello, Turtle. I'm Kojo.
I'm sure you must have heard about me.

11:27.479 --> 11:30.399
I'm Becks's very handsome uncle
from Ghana.

11:31.191 --> 11:32.317
No?

11:32.901 --> 11:35.863
You haven't heard anything at all?
Nothing?

11:37.447 --> 11:40.409
No, that--
She must've mentioned me at least once.

11:41.410 --> 11:42.452
Is that right?

11:43.537 --> 11:44.872
Not even one time?

11:58.844 --> 11:59.845
It's okay.

12:01.054 --> 12:02.264
I'm here now.

12:03.307 --> 12:04.892
I'm gonna take care of you.

12:25.871 --> 12:28.916
Jordan, stop. You're gonna break it.

12:32.377 --> 12:35.506
They have all this baby stuff and no baby.

12:36.006 --> 12:38.217
So what?
-So, it's creepy.

12:45.724 --> 12:48.727
Stop! Jordan. Get--

12:51.355 --> 12:54.149
They're gonna come up and see.
Jordan! Out.

12:54.149 --> 12:56.735
Eddie, why are we even here?

12:57.569 --> 12:59.321
Mom hated Aunt Lacey.

13:00.072 --> 13:01.073
Bullshit.

13:01.073 --> 13:03.909
Then why did we visit here, like,
three times our entire life?

13:06.286 --> 13:08.622
Well, what choice did we have, Jordan?

13:10.791 --> 13:12.835
Guys, it's time for dinner.

13:17.339 --> 13:18.674
Smells like fish.

13:25.806 --> 13:28.100
You think there's any chance
of calling Domino's?

13:30.769 --> 13:31.770
What?

13:41.405 --> 13:43.323
Can I give you a piece of bread?

13:54.793 --> 13:57.629
The airline will pay for a psychologist.

13:57.629 --> 14:01.508
I think it could be a good idea.
Just, you know, so you--

14:01.508 --> 14:03.385
so you have somebody to talk to.

14:03.385 --> 14:08.056
I mean, you can always,
always talk to us of course.

14:08.056 --> 14:09.183
Absolutely.

14:09.725 --> 14:12.227
but you've got so much going on.

14:13.020 --> 14:14.438
No, thank you.

14:16.273 --> 14:17.941
Yeah. I'll think about it.

14:18.859 --> 14:20.861
Yeah, good. Here.

14:22.613 --> 14:23.697
Damn.

14:27.367 --> 14:29.119
Okay, just wait here.

14:30.454 --> 14:32.748
We're-- You know, we're eating dinner.

14:32.748 --> 14:34.666
Go away. Get out.

14:34.666 --> 14:38.212
Oh, Besa. I'm sorry.
-No, are you sitting down to dinner?

14:38.212 --> 14:41.048
Should I come back later?
-Well, yeah--

14:41.048 --> 14:43.717
I have never seen anything like that...

14:43.717 --> 14:44.801
I know.
-...yesterday.

14:44.801 --> 14:45.886
All those press people.

14:45.886 --> 14:49.223
What does it take to realize people need
a little privacy?

14:49.223 --> 14:52.935
Hi. Edward, it's so nice to meet you.
I'm Besa.

14:52.935 --> 14:55.479
We're right next door, green door.
Weird eagle knocker.

14:55.479 --> 14:59.233
Not my fault, it was there
when we moved in. Knock on it anytime.

14:59.233 --> 15:00.442
He's a little shy.

15:00.442 --> 15:03.487
Honey, say hi to Edward. He won't bite.
Will you, Edward?

15:03.487 --> 15:04.696
Mom.
-Anyway, we should go,

15:04.696 --> 15:09.284
you guys are eating. I made you my nana's
arroz con leche, straight from Havana.

15:09.284 --> 15:11.745
Wow. You did not have to do that.

15:11.745 --> 15:15.499
Never mind. And this is very special.

15:17.918 --> 15:19.086
That's so--

15:19.086 --> 15:22.005
It's a selenite wand.
It has healing powers.

15:22.005 --> 15:24.967
You can wave it over your front door--
-This is awesome. Thank you.

15:24.967 --> 15:26.051
Hey. What's up, Shay?

15:26.051 --> 15:28.929
Seriously, we are here if
you need anything whatsoever.

15:28.929 --> 15:30.013
Right, Shay?
-Come on.

15:30.013 --> 15:33.559
All right. Okay, thank you. Okay.

15:37.479 --> 15:39.106
We'll miss you around here, Adriana.

15:39.773 --> 15:40.774
I'll miss it too.

15:41.400 --> 15:42.526
So, what are your plans?

15:43.443 --> 15:49.116
Well, I started taking classes
at City College in urban planning.

15:49.116 --> 15:51.410
So, I spoke to the department chair,

15:51.410 --> 15:53.829
he said I could start full-time
next semester, so--

15:54.413 --> 15:57.583
Great. That sounds great.
-Yeah, that's the plan.

15:57.583 --> 15:58.667
Good for you.

15:58.667 --> 16:02.254
I am here for anything you ever need.
Okay, we all are. We're family.

16:02.880 --> 16:04.173
Thank you, Cora.

16:04.173 --> 16:06.383
There's something we need to talk about.
-Okay?

16:06.383 --> 16:07.968
I know we're all
mourning your grandmother,

16:07.968 --> 16:11.138
but the reality is her seat
is going to be hotly contested.

16:11.138 --> 16:14.641
There's gonna be national attention.
People are already making announcements.

16:14.641 --> 16:17.603
We need to throw our hat in the ring,
and we need to do it quickly.

16:17.603 --> 16:21.356
This is about your grandmother's legacy.
-I'm not gonna run, Cora.

16:21.940 --> 16:23.734
I was actually thinking about me.

16:26.320 --> 16:28.780
It's just, you quit, and you're going
to graduate school.

16:28.780 --> 16:31.366
So I assumed you weren't--
-No, I'm not.

16:31.366 --> 16:32.451
Okay.

16:32.451 --> 16:36.246
Well, I wanted to ask you if you would
consider giving me your endorsement.

16:36.830 --> 16:38.707
What does anyone care what I think?

16:39.208 --> 16:41.210
You're the congresswoman's granddaughter.

16:41.919 --> 16:42.920
They'll care.

16:43.962 --> 16:46.340
I've been here 14 years,
I'm her Chief of Staff.

16:47.007 --> 16:50.135
I know this job, I know her.
I can win this.

16:52.262 --> 16:55.307
If you need some time to think about it--
-No, I don't need anytime.

16:56.975 --> 16:58.477
You have my endorsement.

17:01.230 --> 17:02.356
Thank you.

17:08.194 --> 17:09.738
Oh, Charles.

17:11.615 --> 17:13.282
You were a pillar of strength.

17:14.867 --> 17:17.954
You gave us security and

17:17.954 --> 17:20.082
unconditional love.

17:22.041 --> 17:23.042
And...

17:24.336 --> 17:30.217
listen, I know I was not always the
most low-maintenance person in the world.

17:33.178 --> 17:35.931
You loved me for who I am. Always.

17:37.850 --> 17:39.726
And we love you always.

17:40.978 --> 17:42.062
And we miss you.

17:43.981 --> 17:44.982
Go ahead.

17:47.359 --> 17:48.360
Love you, Dad.

17:51.154 --> 17:52.865
I said what I needed to...
-Thank you, Honey.

17:52.865 --> 17:54.491
...say at the funeral, Mom.
-So succinct.

17:55.284 --> 17:56.285
Okay.

17:58.787 --> 18:00.789
I can't stop thinking about the text.

18:00.789 --> 18:04.376
What text?
-The text, Mom. The text that he sent.

18:05.419 --> 18:08.088
Well, he was obviously in a...
-Yeah--

18:08.088 --> 18:11.550
...in a very heightened state.
-He should've been with us though.

18:12.134 --> 18:13.343
Well--

18:13.343 --> 18:16.388
No matter how much he was in LA,
he never missed our birthdays before.

18:17.806 --> 18:19.391
Wait a second.
-What?

18:19.391 --> 18:22.811
Our tree, our linden tree.
-What tree?

18:22.811 --> 18:24.521
The--
-The linden tree.

18:25.230 --> 18:26.231
Excuse me.

18:27.065 --> 18:29.193
Oh, my God, Mom.
-Oh, my God. Excuse me!

18:29.693 --> 18:31.236
Mom--
-Excuse me.

18:32.154 --> 18:35.115
There was a linden tree here,
and it's not here anymore.

18:35.115 --> 18:36.992
Mom, he has nothing to do with it.

18:38.744 --> 18:39.661
Oh, my God.

18:40.537 --> 18:43.415
The linden tree, yes.
-Yes. It's gone.

18:44.124 --> 18:47.503
And it-- You know,
it was a mature tree. It was beautiful.

18:47.503 --> 18:49.505
And when we were here for the funeral,

18:50.464 --> 18:53.342
I made a note
to the funeral director that I--

18:53.342 --> 18:55.802
There seemed to be a little rot in
the bark.

18:56.595 --> 18:58.388
But now it's not here.

18:59.431 --> 19:01.558
And this is my husband's grave.

19:01.558 --> 19:04.061
And he wasn't even supposed
to be on that flight.

19:04.061 --> 19:06.605
He slept in and he missed his flight.
-Mom.

19:06.605 --> 19:10.442
And so he took the next flight,
and it crashed on our birthdays.

19:10.442 --> 19:13.779
Mom.
-And he died, and I don't know what to do.

19:15.030 --> 19:16.406
He was our rock.

19:17.115 --> 19:18.700
Can we sit down? I know.
-He was our rock.

19:18.700 --> 19:20.577
Can we sit down?
-And I don't know what to do,

19:20.577 --> 19:22.037
and his tree is gone.

19:22.037 --> 19:23.914
I know. Let's sit down.

19:24.623 --> 19:27.209
I'm sorry.
-Can you mention it?

19:27.793 --> 19:28.794
Sit.

19:37.719 --> 19:40.305
This is nice.
-Yeah.

19:51.900 --> 19:53.485
Sorry, I think I'm in the wrong place.

19:53.485 --> 19:55.571
Wait,
you're looking for the support group?

19:55.571 --> 19:58.782
Yes, the support network.
I received an e-mail.

19:58.782 --> 20:02.327
Then you're in the right place.
-Okay, good, because I need support.

20:02.911 --> 20:03.996
Number one--

20:05.122 --> 20:08.917
Here, I need an American passport
for my niece, to take her home to Ghana.

20:08.917 --> 20:10.794
In addition to the passport,

20:10.794 --> 20:14.631
I've been getting eviction notices
from my sister's very rude landlady,

20:14.631 --> 20:17.217
who has been threatening
to turn off the gas and electric

20:17.217 --> 20:18.927
if we don't vacate the apartment.

20:18.927 --> 20:24.391
Also, my niece doesn't speak. To anyone.
I need her to speak.

20:26.560 --> 20:29.897
I think this might be a different type
of support group than what you thought.

20:29.897 --> 20:32.649
This is talk therapy,
it's grief counseling?

20:37.696 --> 20:42.534
I see. So you talk about your feelings?

20:44.119 --> 20:47.623
Well, if we were to reduce it
to its most basic description,

20:47.623 --> 20:48.957
well, basically, yeah.

21:02.513 --> 21:03.639
Continue.

21:04.765 --> 21:08.685
Yes. I'll give you a 20% discount
and that is my best offer.

21:09.269 --> 21:12.105
Yes, but my porta-potties
are superior quality.

21:12.105 --> 21:13.941
They are scented, they smell beautiful.

21:13.941 --> 21:17.444
We have lavender,
grapefruit, pineapple, watermelon--

21:17.444 --> 21:19.279
No, the watermelon is sold out. Listen,

21:19.279 --> 21:21.573
my competitors
don't have scented porta-potties.

21:23.158 --> 21:25.160
Yes, call me back. You have 24 hours.

21:26.495 --> 21:27.579
Okay, bye.

21:28.163 --> 21:30.999
People don't like to talk about shit,
but shit is the reality.

21:31.667 --> 21:33.126
It needs to be discussed.

21:34.086 --> 21:35.337
Yes, it does.

21:36.004 --> 21:38.131
This is the number for
a tenants' rights advocacy group.

21:38.131 --> 21:40.884
If you just tell them that Congresswoman
Washington's office sent you,

21:40.884 --> 21:44.179
they will make sure no one turns off your
utilities while you are staying there.

21:44.179 --> 21:45.931
And...
-Okay.

21:45.931 --> 21:48.141
...in terms of a passport, try these guys.

21:48.141 --> 21:50.227
They are out in Queens...
-Okay.

21:50.227 --> 21:52.855
...but they're the fastest way
to get an expedited passport.

21:53.772 --> 21:56.149
And as far as your niece not talking,

21:56.149 --> 22:01.196
I don't really know much about kids,
but maybe she just needs time.

22:06.201 --> 22:07.327
Thank you.
-Yeah.

22:08.370 --> 22:09.997
What's your name?
-Adriana.

22:11.373 --> 22:12.416
Good luck in Ghana.

22:17.838 --> 22:18.839
Okay.

22:49.912 --> 22:53.498
It's beautiful. Thank you.

22:53.498 --> 22:56.668
It wrecked me that I couldn't
be there when you lost her.

22:56.668 --> 23:00.214
I was on a production rewrite, I--
-It's not a big deal.

23:00.797 --> 23:03.634
I get to drink as much as I want
and we're gonna try again.

23:04.343 --> 23:05.802
It is a big deal.

23:10.516 --> 23:14.311
Right, so try again. That's the plan?

23:15.103 --> 23:16.271
Yes, that's the plan.

23:25.989 --> 23:28.283
Did you ever call that adoption agency?

23:28.283 --> 23:29.368
Jane.

23:29.993 --> 23:34.581
They match families with children who
need homes. They're kind and sensitive.

23:34.581 --> 23:36.708
Yeah, they're great humanitarians.

23:36.708 --> 23:40.671
They take $50,000 from desperate,
vulnerable people.

23:40.671 --> 23:43.048
If it's about the money,
I can help you out. I--

23:43.048 --> 23:45.551
Don't throw your money around.
Don't do that.

23:45.551 --> 23:49.012
I realize that Mom gave you
her golden reproductive system

23:49.012 --> 23:53.100
and all I got was her TMJ,
but I am not giving up.

23:53.100 --> 23:57.187
I want a baby, I don't want to adopt, and
you should fucking want that for me too.

23:58.063 --> 23:59.982
You're my big sister.

24:19.835 --> 24:20.836
Creepy.

24:28.010 --> 24:29.136
Whose jacket is that?

24:30.304 --> 24:32.848
It was in the house. I need something soft
to crash into.

24:33.390 --> 24:35.350
Is it your dad's or something?

24:35.350 --> 24:37.394
I needed something soft to crash into.

24:37.394 --> 24:39.980
It was in the closet.
Is that cool with you, Anderson Cooper?

24:42.774 --> 24:44.776
So what are you doing? What is this?

24:46.236 --> 24:47.237
Roller Derby practice.

24:48.280 --> 24:49.698
You do Roller Derby?
-Yeah.

24:50.365 --> 24:52.075
Gonna. I got a tryout set up.

24:52.618 --> 24:55.120
So, what's it like being famous?
-I'm not famous.

24:55.120 --> 24:57.331
Okay. So you're telling me
all those reporters were here

24:57.331 --> 24:59.249
to see how your aunt's dandelions
were coming in?

25:03.962 --> 25:05.297
You have a--

25:06.507 --> 25:08.467
That? It's nothing.
-Blood. Yeah.

25:08.467 --> 25:09.968
I got much worse than that.

25:09.968 --> 25:13.514
You should've seen this a week ago.
It was totally black-and-blue. So cool.

25:14.973 --> 25:16.975
And you see this and this?

25:16.975 --> 25:18.727
And this?
-Yeah?

25:19.603 --> 25:20.604
All from Roller Derby.

25:22.731 --> 25:23.815
Seems pretty dangerous.

25:24.316 --> 25:25.317
You bet.

25:27.945 --> 25:28.946
Those from the crash?

25:30.030 --> 25:31.323
Yeah.

25:31.865 --> 25:35.327
Any other injuries to speak of?
-My leg mostly.

25:35.827 --> 25:38.705
Yeah, I noticed that. Can I see?

25:40.707 --> 25:42.501
Sure.

25:44.378 --> 25:48.006
Oh, gnarly. It gonna get back to normal?

25:48.006 --> 25:50.259
They don't know yet. Hope so.

25:51.802 --> 25:52.803
That must suck.

25:54.221 --> 25:56.014
I mean,
guess it could be a whole lot worse.

26:05.732 --> 26:07.442
Anyway, I should go.

26:10.153 --> 26:11.154
Okay.

26:13.156 --> 26:14.408
See you around.

26:15.158 --> 26:16.410
Yeah, see ya.

26:34.928 --> 26:36.889
I think we should start believing in God.

26:38.515 --> 26:39.516
Yeah, right.

26:40.058 --> 26:41.059
No, I'm serious.

26:42.352 --> 26:45.105
It's the only way
we all stay together. You, me...

26:47.733 --> 26:48.734
Mom and Dad.

26:48.734 --> 26:51.904
You don't just start believing
in God. It doesn't work that way.

26:58.368 --> 27:00.454
What are you doing?
-Praying.

27:00.454 --> 27:01.872
We're not even Jewish.

27:01.872 --> 27:02.956
We're half Jewish.

27:04.041 --> 27:05.167
On Dad's side.

27:05.876 --> 27:07.920
Judaism is passed through
the maternal side.

27:08.587 --> 27:11.048
You don't just start believing in God.
-Would you stop being a know-it-all?

27:11.048 --> 27:12.549
Okay?

27:25.771 --> 27:29.191
That's the prayer for wine.
You're making zero sense.

27:29.191 --> 27:32.152
You can't just say you believe in God
and expect Mom and Dad to come back.

27:32.152 --> 27:33.946
Well, what do you fucking suggest, huh?

27:34.696 --> 27:36.406
Why don't you come up
with something better?

28:04.309 --> 28:05.310
Amen.

28:06.687 --> 28:07.729
Amen.

28:10.065 --> 28:11.358
Good night, stupid.

28:13.193 --> 28:14.528
Good night, stupid.

28:44.099 --> 28:48.604
I humbly announce my candidacy
for the 13th congressional district

28:48.604 --> 28:50.272
of the city of New York.

28:52.024 --> 28:54.776
I know this district better than anyone.

28:55.319 --> 29:00.282
I know Congresswoman Washington
better than anyone.

29:00.282 --> 29:03.577
I know this job better than anyone.

29:04.453 --> 29:06.997
I am the best person for this job.

29:20.177 --> 29:21.678
God, your story is just so amazing.

29:23.055 --> 29:25.766
I cried when I heard it.
Well, the whole country did.

29:26.767 --> 29:29.353
It was God. It had to be.

29:34.858 --> 29:35.859
God saved you.

29:38.862 --> 29:39.863
Thank you.

29:44.952 --> 29:46.537
Hi.
-Hi.

29:46.537 --> 29:47.621
Hi.

29:50.832 --> 29:52.584
His wounds are healing.

29:52.584 --> 29:56.213
He's got more movement back
in his left leg, which I was happy to see.

29:56.213 --> 29:59.842
That is great. That is so good.
I thought it was getting better.

29:59.842 --> 30:01.343
Didn't I say that, John?
-Yeah, she was--

30:01.343 --> 30:04.137
But I am very concerned.
He's lost more weight.

30:04.137 --> 30:07.266
I know. He's a rail. I'm all over it.

30:07.266 --> 30:10.060
I've been researching everything.

30:10.060 --> 30:14.022
I'm a bit of a nutrition buff,
so I knew a fair amount coming into this.

30:14.022 --> 30:18.777
Now that he's finally home,
I can really get this done.

30:18.777 --> 30:22.197
Some of what that hospital was trying to
pawn off as food was absolutely criminal.

30:22.197 --> 30:24.074
So here's the table of contents in here.

30:24.074 --> 30:26.702
This is great.
-The recipes are in the back.

30:26.702 --> 30:29.705
Mrs. Curtis, you need to hear this.

30:30.330 --> 30:31.790
We are at a critical juncture.

30:33.083 --> 30:35.752
Edward is now in the fifth percentile
for his weight.

30:36.461 --> 30:38.088
This is going in the wrong direction.

30:38.088 --> 30:40.799
If this doesn't turn around,
I have to re-admit him

30:40.799 --> 30:42.301
and put a feeding tube in him.

30:43.218 --> 30:44.553
No one wants that.

30:46.305 --> 30:47.306
He needs to eat.

30:48.765 --> 30:50.225
It doesn't matter what.

30:50.225 --> 30:53.520
You have to put calories
in this boy's body now.

30:54.188 --> 30:55.189
Okay?

31:04.239 --> 31:06.200
Dee Dee.
-Hi, Brad.

31:06.200 --> 31:10.662
How are you?
-I am so incredibly sorry.

31:10.662 --> 31:12.414
Hi. Thank you.
-I--

31:12.414 --> 31:14.583
I can't imagine
what you must be going through.

31:14.583 --> 31:17.586
It's something else.

31:18.962 --> 31:20.464
I have to say you would never know.

31:20.464 --> 31:23.175
You look as beautiful as ever.
-Thank you.

31:24.259 --> 31:26.053
Yeah. Well, should we just...

31:26.053 --> 31:29.181
Yeah, yes. Thank you.
-Okay. Let's...

31:31.975 --> 31:36.897
Dee Dee, did you and Charles discuss
your finances recently?

31:37.481 --> 31:40.651
In terms of assets and liabilities?

31:40.651 --> 31:43.820
I mean, you know. That was his department.

31:43.820 --> 31:46.114
I am not a left-brained person.

31:46.114 --> 31:50.285
So thank God he was so, you know,
I mean, you know how he was.

31:50.285 --> 31:52.162
He was like, on it.
-Yes.

31:52.913 --> 31:55.207
So, I'm gonna learn.

31:55.958 --> 31:57.167
Right. I see.

32:02.256 --> 32:03.257
Well...

32:04.716 --> 32:06.593
There's no other way to put this.

32:07.344 --> 32:11.056
There is a considerable amount of debt.
-Debt?

32:11.640 --> 32:14.309
Yeah.
There are mortgages against the house.

32:14.935 --> 32:16.353
Negative cash flows.

32:16.353 --> 32:18.522
The retirement fund is tapped out.

32:20.357 --> 32:23.360
Things have gotten really bad
ever since he left Leighton.

32:23.360 --> 32:24.862
He didn't leave Leighton.

32:27.865 --> 32:31.159
Dee Dee, Charles lost his job
a year and a half ago.

32:34.830 --> 32:35.956
No.

32:35.956 --> 32:40.377
That's impossible,
'cause he didn't tell me.

32:40.377 --> 32:45.716
He would've told me.
We tell each other everything, so...

32:50.762 --> 32:53.098
I'm sorry, Dee Dee. I truly am.

32:53.098 --> 32:56.685
He thought that he was gonna turn things
around financially for you guys.

32:56.685 --> 32:58.520
I know he was working on that.

33:01.732 --> 33:05.319
So, I don't-- What does this mean?

33:05.319 --> 33:08.197
I mean, Zoe's at Barnard.
She's got three more years to go, like--

33:09.323 --> 33:11.992
What are you telling me here, Brad?
-Okay. Well...

33:12.701 --> 33:15.412
You know what?
This is gonna work itself out.

33:15.412 --> 33:18.207
It is? Okay.
-Well, n--

33:19.458 --> 33:22.794
I don't-- Don't get the wrong idea.
I mean, we have a lot to do,

33:22.794 --> 33:29.426
but for starters, we need to unload
anything that isn't absolutely necessary.

33:30.052 --> 33:33.514
We need to stop cash going out.
Immediately.

33:34.306 --> 33:37.351
Club memberships, clothes shopping,
expensive dinners.

33:37.935 --> 33:40.312
And you need to divest
of all your property

33:40.312 --> 33:42.606
outside of your primary residence.

33:42.606 --> 33:44.650
Well, we only have the Jersey place.

33:44.650 --> 33:47.444
As you know,
we sold the Vermont place already, so...

33:47.444 --> 33:49.821
No. I mean, the condo in LA.

33:53.700 --> 33:55.160
We don't have a condo in LA.

34:15.347 --> 34:19.518
Would you like a glass of water?
-Yes, that would be wonderful. Thank you.

34:20.518 --> 34:21.687
I'll be right back.

34:30.237 --> 34:32.947
I hate this place. I never shop here.

34:32.947 --> 34:35.534
I usually go way out of my way
to go to Whole Foods,

34:35.534 --> 34:38.495
but even they import most of their produce
from other countries,

34:38.495 --> 34:40.998
so their carbon footprint is just--
Never mind.

34:40.998 --> 34:43.458
My point is-- You get my point. I'm...

34:46.210 --> 34:47.379
I'm fucked up.

34:57.054 --> 34:58.807
What happened isn't fair, Edward.

35:01.935 --> 35:03.979
It fucking sucks.

35:11.153 --> 35:12.696
I can't eat either.

35:19.912 --> 35:21.872
I know I will never replace your mom.

35:24.541 --> 35:27.961
I know I can't do that,
and I'm not trying to.

35:38.305 --> 35:39.306
But I am your aunt.

35:39.890 --> 35:43.977
And I'm going to do my best
to take care of you. I promise.

35:43.977 --> 35:45.812
And I do not break promises.

35:50.108 --> 35:51.443
So, here's the dealio.

35:52.653 --> 35:56.448
We're gonna go in there, you're gonna
pick out whatever looks good to you,

35:57.616 --> 35:59.701
and I'm gonna cook it,
and you're gonna eat it.

36:02.663 --> 36:03.872
Okay?

36:08.168 --> 36:09.169
Good.

36:10.045 --> 36:11.046
Let's go.

36:14.049 --> 36:15.050
All right.

36:31.608 --> 36:33.402
These?
-Yeah!

36:34.444 --> 36:37.406
Great. Excellent.

36:39.992 --> 36:41.201
Good.

36:47.332 --> 36:50.127
Yeah, go for it. Go for it. Sure.

36:58.051 --> 37:04.224
Edward I'm gonna run and pick up
the red meat from the butcher.

37:04.224 --> 37:05.809
Yum.
-Okay.

37:05.809 --> 37:10.397
You keep shopping. You're doing great.
Okay? I'm gonna be right back.

37:30.501 --> 37:34.171
I'm so sorry, Edward. I'm so sorry.

37:34.171 --> 37:35.464
Who are you?

37:35.464 --> 37:40.302
I'm so sorry you lost your brother.
-What?

38:05.285 --> 38:06.286
Amen.

38:14.169 --> 38:15.879
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.

38:27.850 --> 38:29.434
Paper covers rock.

38:43.323 --> 38:46.952
Oh, my God!

38:49.580 --> 38:52.499
He was dehydrated. He's back home now.

38:52.499 --> 38:57.045
He's stable. But he's not okay.

38:59.006 --> 39:01.550
He's in the fifth percentile
of his weight.

39:01.550 --> 39:05.262
And he's close
to having to be re-hospitalized.

39:06.889 --> 39:10.142
The doctors aren't sure
if he's ever going to thrive.

39:25.657 --> 39:26.950
I have tried--

39:29.536 --> 39:32.706
I have tried for the last nine years
to get pregnant.

39:37.127 --> 39:38.921
Maybe there's a reason it didn't happen.

39:38.921 --> 39:42.382
I don't know how to be anyone's mother.

39:42.382 --> 39:46.678
And I definitely don't know
how to be Edward's mother.

39:48.764 --> 39:52.518
This situation is so far over my head.

39:56.146 --> 39:57.272
I'm drowning.

40:04.780 --> 40:06.990
Thank you, Lacey.
-Yeah.

40:11.078 --> 40:14.915
Looks like we're out of time for the day.
We have a choir group coming through.

40:16.124 --> 40:19.670
Well,
I'd like to give you a hug if I could.

40:22.172 --> 40:23.715
Nobody knows how to be a mother.

40:51.326 --> 40:52.327
Becks.

40:54.329 --> 40:56.707
Becks, time to go.

41:07.009 --> 41:08.677
Becks, we can draw when we get home.

41:12.472 --> 41:14.391
You didn't tell me
your niece was an artist.

41:17.311 --> 41:18.645
Can I see what you're drawing?

41:20.772 --> 41:21.773
Oh, my gosh.

41:25.152 --> 41:28.071
Wow. Oh, my gosh. Wow.

41:28.071 --> 41:31.283
Those are not just any butterflies.
I kinda recognize them.

41:32.201 --> 41:35.120
They're from the Natural History Museum,
right?

41:35.746 --> 41:38.540
It's beautiful. It's kinda like
my favorite place in the world.

41:40.459 --> 41:41.502
Me too.

41:42.878 --> 41:44.213
I'm Adriana, by the way.

41:47.132 --> 41:48.217
I'm Becks.

41:53.347 --> 41:54.556
Are you hungry?

42:03.482 --> 42:05.150
Anyway, water under the bridge.

42:05.734 --> 42:09.988
It was just so annoying when she said
that she was the best person for the job.

42:09.988 --> 42:13.158
Well, she's running for office.
Of course she's going to say that.

42:13.158 --> 42:15.035
Well,
she's not the best person for the job.

42:15.619 --> 42:16.620
So, who is?

42:20.666 --> 42:22.209
You were going to say you.

42:22.209 --> 42:25.087
No, I wasn't. No.
-Yes. You was.

42:25.087 --> 42:27.464
No. I was-- No.

42:29.550 --> 42:31.009
Whatever. Maybe I was.

42:33.637 --> 42:34.888
So why don't you run?

42:36.098 --> 42:39.935
You know, I grew up
going to the office with my grandmother

42:39.935 --> 42:42.813
since I was five years old.

42:43.897 --> 42:46.358
The 13th congressional district
is in my DNA.

42:46.358 --> 42:50.529
And my entire life,
all I wanted to be was the Congresswoman.

42:50.529 --> 42:52.322
You know, my grandmother was my hero.

42:52.948 --> 42:58.579
But then you start working in the office,
and you kinda get disillusioned.

42:59.329 --> 43:01.999
By what?
-Politics.

43:04.001 --> 43:07.754
There's just a lot of people
who have lost their way,

43:08.922 --> 43:10.799
and I don't wanna become one of them.

43:14.803 --> 43:18.432
You know sometimes
we don't choose our path.

43:19.725 --> 43:21.476
Sometimes our path chooses us.

43:23.645 --> 43:24.646
So philosophical.

43:25.939 --> 43:26.940
Thank you.

43:28.650 --> 43:31.612
You should run. You won't lose your way.

43:32.529 --> 43:34.990
I just do--
-What?

43:36.533 --> 43:38.160
I just don't know when I'm gonna be ready.

43:40.704 --> 43:44.875
Adriana, you are already ready.
And you'll never be ready.

43:51.465 --> 43:52.466
Hi.

43:54.635 --> 43:55.969
Your food has been waiting for you.

44:51.483 --> 44:52.484
Hello?

44:55.654 --> 44:57.114
Is anyone there? Hello?

45:00.200 --> 45:02.452
Is this the residence of Charles Cameron?

45:02.452 --> 45:05.706
Yeah, it is.
I'm sorry, who is this calling?

45:38.071 --> 45:39.865
Motherfucker, Charles!

45:40.490 --> 45:42.618
You fucked me!

45:54.630 --> 45:56.715
We all grieve in our own way.

45:57.966 --> 45:59.134
In our own time.

46:00.469 --> 46:06.141
My hope for this group is that we give
each other the time and space we need.

46:06.892 --> 46:12.648
But we need to understand
that there's no formula to healing.

46:12.648 --> 46:14.066
There's no magic bullet.

46:15.108 --> 46:20.113
We will come out of this. But none of us
will come out of it unscathed.

46:27.579 --> 46:30.457
You sure you're okay with this?
-I'm working on it.

46:30.457 --> 46:31.959
Have a-- Sit down.

46:32.543 --> 46:35.087
This might be
the greatest day of my marriage.

47:03.615 --> 47:04.616
It's good.

47:06.326 --> 47:07.786
I'm so glad you like it.

47:07.786 --> 47:09.955
Drink a little water.
You need to stay hydrated.

47:10.789 --> 47:14.376
C-C-C-C-C-Corn dogs.

47:15.043 --> 47:17.379
Manna from heaven. Try one.

47:17.379 --> 47:19.173
I-- No. I'm okay.
-No, come on. Just one bite.

47:27.306 --> 47:28.891
This is disgusting.

47:30.601 --> 47:33.896
And the best thing I've ever eaten.

47:39.026 --> 47:40.819
What are we gonna do
with all of this food?

47:40.819 --> 47:42.613
I think I overdid it a little bit.

47:42.613 --> 47:45.324
Oh, no. We got it. Don't worry about it.

47:48.994 --> 47:51.246
Okay, sweetie. It's a work in progress.

47:51.246 --> 47:53.207
Yeah, so the bed finally arrived.

47:53.207 --> 47:58.253
It's missing a few nuts and bolts,
some of which are potentially structural.

47:58.754 --> 48:03.634
We can paint if you don't like the color.
And pick out different bedding.

48:04.510 --> 48:08.013
No. This is really nice. Thank you.

48:08.013 --> 48:10.891
Just wait, Edward. Just wait.

48:15.062 --> 48:16.063
Good night.

48:20.526 --> 48:21.527
Okay.

48:23.529 --> 48:26.448
All right, night. Sweet dreams.

48:27.699 --> 48:33.622
And if you get cold, just yell.
Or if you need anything. Just next door.

48:51.056 --> 48:52.641
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.

48:54.059 --> 48:55.143
Paper covers rock.

48:55.727 --> 48:57.855
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.

48:59.773 --> 49:00.816
Paper covers rock.

49:12.411 --> 49:13.704
Good night, stupid.

49:18.083 --> 49:19.293
Good night, stupid.

49:48.405 --> 49:49.990
Hi, Edward.

49:51.200 --> 49:52.201
We had extra.

49:52.826 --> 49:53.911
Thank you.

49:55.996 --> 49:56.997
Yeah, okay.

50:01.627 --> 50:03.962
Is Shay home?

50:05.631 --> 50:09.218
Shay?
-Shay! You decent?

50:11.845 --> 50:12.846
Shay.

50:14.515 --> 50:17.643
Hey, Shay.
Is it okay if Edward says hello?

50:23.941 --> 50:24.942
Whatever.

50:26.276 --> 50:27.319
Okay.

50:34.117 --> 50:35.118
Cool room.

50:37.746 --> 50:38.747
Gee, thanks.

50:53.679 --> 50:56.557
I gotta go to sleep. Like, soon.

50:57.140 --> 50:59.977
If I don't get eight hours
of sleep at night, bad things happen.

51:01.395 --> 51:02.396
Okay.

51:07.442 --> 51:09.403
Do you mind if I sleep over?

51:12.823 --> 51:13.824
Here?

51:14.575 --> 51:15.576
On the floor.

51:18.829 --> 51:19.830
I guess.

51:47.774 --> 51:48.775
Good night, stupid.

51:50.819 --> 51:52.112
What'd you say?

51:54.323 --> 51:55.991
Could you just say it back?

51:57.242 --> 51:59.745
What? Why?

52:08.212 --> 52:09.213
Please?

52:16.011 --> 52:17.012
Good night, stupid.
