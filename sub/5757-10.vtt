WEBVTT

00:03.937 --> 00:05.439
( gasps )

00:05.473 --> 00:07.375
YOUR PANELS CAME BACK
WITH HIGH LEVELS OF HGH.

00:07.408 --> 00:09.043
HUMAN GROWTH HORMONE?

00:09.077 --> 00:10.711
EMILY, IF YOU'RE USING
A PERFORMANCE-ENHANCING DRUG,

00:10.744 --> 00:12.646
IT'S GOING TO SHOW UP
IN YOUR TESTS.

00:12.680 --> 00:14.382
CAN I JUST SAY
HOW NICE THIS IS--

00:14.415 --> 00:16.050
REACHING FOR YOUR HAND

00:16.084 --> 00:17.785
AND NOT WORRYING ABOUT
WHO MIGHT BE WATCHING US.

00:17.818 --> 00:20.188
( doorbell rings )

00:20.221 --> 00:23.524
SORRY TO INTERRUPT,
BUT IT'S ABOUT MIKE.
HOW WAS THE DINNER PARTY?

00:23.557 --> 00:26.294
IT WAS FINE,
TILL THE COPS SHOWED UP
TO LET US KNOW THAT OUR SON

00:26.327 --> 00:28.296
HAD BEEN ARRESTED
FOR BREAKING AND ENTERING.

00:28.329 --> 00:30.831
SAVE THE DATE.
THEY'RE GETTING
MARRIED IN SIX WEEKS.

00:30.864 --> 00:32.232
I JUST SPOKE
TO YOUR FATHER AGAIN.

00:32.266 --> 00:33.567
HE WANTS YOU
TO TALK TO ISABEL.

00:33.601 --> 00:34.835
I'M NOT GONNA BE
A BRIDESMAID.

00:34.868 --> 00:36.670
WHAT DO YOU WANT
FROM ME?
THE TRUTH.

00:36.704 --> 00:38.472
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA
GIVE ME?

00:38.506 --> 00:40.808
WE'LL MAKE SURE THE VIDEO
STAYS IN A SAFE PLACE.

00:40.841 --> 00:43.244
SHOULD I BE WORRIED ABOUT
YOU AND THIS JASON GUY?

00:43.277 --> 00:44.345
NO.

00:44.378 --> 00:46.547
THE TRUTH IS,
I DO CARE ABOUT YOU.

00:50.351 --> 00:51.852
WHAT IS THIS PLACE?

00:51.885 --> 00:54.088
IT'S JASON'S DARKROOM.

00:54.122 --> 00:56.824
WHOSE FACE IS THIS?

00:56.857 --> 00:58.826
OH, MY GOD, IT'S ARIA!

00:58.859 --> 01:01.295
THEY'RE ALL ARIA!

01:02.796 --> 01:06.500
( indistinct chatter )

01:06.534 --> 01:07.768
WHY IS YOUR
PHONE TURNED OFF?

01:07.801 --> 01:09.870
I WAS TRYING TO
REACH YOU ALL NIGHT.

01:09.903 --> 01:12.140
I'M SORRY.
I WAS AVOIDING
SOMEONE'S CALL.

01:12.173 --> 01:14.142
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT JASON.

01:14.175 --> 01:16.677
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT JASON.

01:18.546 --> 01:20.414
HE KISSED ME.
ARIA!

01:20.448 --> 01:22.416
I KNOW, IT WAS A MISTAKE.

01:22.450 --> 01:24.252
LOOK, I WAS TRYING TO FIGURE
OUT A WAY TO TELL YOU GUYS.

01:24.285 --> 01:28.256
I TOTALLY DON'T KNOW
HOW TO TELL EZRA.
DO I EVEN TELL HIM?

01:28.289 --> 01:31.325
ARIA, JASON HAD PICTURES
OF YOU. CREEPY PICTURES.

01:31.359 --> 01:33.127
WHAT?

01:33.161 --> 01:35.263
SPENCER AND I FOUND
A DARKROOM IN HIS
WOODSHED.

01:35.296 --> 01:37.665
HE DEVELOPED PHOTOGRAPHS
OF YOU SLEEPING...

01:37.698 --> 01:40.201
SLEEPING?!
...SLEEPING OR DRUGGED.

01:40.234 --> 01:43.471
OKAY, WELL,
I'M OFFICIALLY TERRIFIED.

01:43.504 --> 01:45.706
GOOD. 'KAY,
IT'S ABOUT TIME.

01:45.739 --> 01:48.342
AND FOR THE RECORD,
I NEVER BOUGHT JASON'S
WHOLE ACT--

01:48.376 --> 01:50.444
HANGING AROUND HERE,
PRETENDING TO BE
CONCERNED

01:50.478 --> 01:52.846
ABOUT AT-RISK YOUTH,
USING YOUR BROTHER
TO GET TO YOU.

01:52.880 --> 01:55.349
HOLD ON.
HE REALLY DID
HELP MIKE.

01:55.383 --> 01:56.684
SO HE COULD GET
IN YOUR HOUSE...

01:56.717 --> 01:57.818
...AND KISS YOU!

02:00.488 --> 02:04.258
YOU'RE KISSING HIM NOW?
NO,KISSED ME.

02:04.292 --> 02:07.861
THANKS, EM, I REALLY
NEEDED THAT, ON TOP
OF EVERYTHING ELSE.

02:07.895 --> 02:10.130
ARIA, HE'S DANGEROUS.

02:12.500 --> 02:13.934
FINE.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.669
FINE. I GOTTA GO.

02:20.641 --> 02:22.476
DID YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS?

02:22.510 --> 02:24.878
I KNEW THAT
THEY WERE... CONNECTING,

02:24.912 --> 02:27.181
BUT I PROMISED
I WOULDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

02:27.215 --> 02:28.916
IT'S OKAY.

02:28.949 --> 02:31.785
SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO
HURT SOMEONE TO HELP THEM.

02:31.819 --> 02:34.288
Man on PA: THE COLLEGE FAIR
 WILL BEGIN THIS AFTERNOON

02:34.322 --> 02:36.290
AT ONE O'CLOCK
 IN THE CAFETERIA.

02:36.324 --> 02:38.859
SO... READY FOR
THE COLLEGE FAIR?

02:38.892 --> 02:41.195
NO, I'M NOT STAYING.

02:41.229 --> 02:43.364
I PROMISED THAT I WOULD
PACK UP THE REST OF
IAN'S STUFF

02:43.397 --> 02:45.433
BEFORE MELISSA GETS HOME.

02:45.466 --> 02:46.967
TOBY'S GONNA HELP ME.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.937
SO IT'S A TABLE FOR ONE.

02:49.970 --> 02:51.372
SORRY.

03:40.288 --> 03:42.456
* GOT A SECRET,
 CAN YOU KEEP IT *

03:42.490 --> 03:44.858
* SWEAR THIS ONE
 YOU'LL SAVE *

03:44.892 --> 03:47.495
* BETTER LOCK IT
 IN YOUR POCKET *

03:47.528 --> 03:49.863
* TAKIN' THIS ONE
 TO THE GRAVE *

03:49.897 --> 03:52.266
* IF I SHOW YOU
 THEN I KNOW YOU *

03:52.300 --> 03:54.935
* WON'T TELL WHAT I SAID

03:54.968 --> 03:59.773
* 'CAUSE TWO CAN KEEP A SECRET
 IF ONE OF THEM IS DEAD *

04:04.044 --> 04:06.747
'MORNING, SWEETIE.
WHERE'S EMILY?

04:06.780 --> 04:09.350
SHE GOT UP SUPER EARLY
TO GO TO SWIMMING PRACTICE.

04:09.383 --> 04:11.018
I THOUGHT SHE WASN'T
ALLOWED TO SWIM YET.

04:11.051 --> 04:12.686
SHE'S NOT.
SHE SITS BY THE POOL,

04:12.720 --> 04:15.423
HOPING SOMEONE WILL
PUSH HER IN.

04:15.456 --> 04:17.858
SHE IS NOT GOING TO
GET ANY BETTER DOING
WHAT SHE'S DOING.

04:17.891 --> 04:19.293
EMILY NEEDS TO HEAL,
INSIDE AND OUT.

04:19.327 --> 04:20.594
YEAH, TELL ME ABOUT IT.

04:20.628 --> 04:22.963
SHE GRINDS HER TEETH
IN HER SLEEP NOW.

04:22.996 --> 04:24.565
IT'S LIKE LYING
NEXT TO A BUZZ SAW.

04:24.598 --> 04:25.833
HANNA, COMPASSION.

04:25.866 --> 04:28.702
I HAVE IT,
JUST NOT IN THE MORNING.

04:28.736 --> 04:31.505
IF I COULD JUST...
FIND THIS... THING.

04:31.539 --> 04:34.342
HERE IT IS.

04:34.375 --> 04:36.344
GIFT CERTIFICATE,

04:36.377 --> 04:37.945
FOR A MASSAGE.

04:37.978 --> 04:41.349
EMILY NEEDS IT
MORE THAN I DO.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

04:41.382 --> 04:43.751
ALL YOU EVER GAVE ME
WAS A TWO-FOR-ONE
AT THE DONUT HUT.

04:43.784 --> 04:45.453
WHICH I APPRECIATED,

04:45.486 --> 04:48.589
AND I WILL GIVE THIS
TO EMILY WHEN I SEE
HER AT SCHOOL.

04:50.391 --> 04:52.626
SO...

04:52.660 --> 04:54.628
WHAT DID YOUR FATHER
HAVE TO SAY?

04:54.662 --> 04:56.364
NOTHING MUCH.

04:56.397 --> 04:57.931
MAY I?

05:03.571 --> 05:04.838
"DEAR HANNA,

05:04.872 --> 05:06.707
"I'M SO PROUD
TO CALL YOU MY DAUGHTER.

05:06.740 --> 05:08.576
"TO HAVE YOU STANDING
UP THERE WITH ME

05:08.609 --> 05:11.512
IS THE BEST WEDDING GIFT
I COULD IMAGINE."

05:11.545 --> 05:13.581
WOW.

05:13.614 --> 05:15.449
WHATEVER.

05:15.483 --> 05:18.085
THE CEREMONY WILL ONLY BE,
LIKE, 20 MINUTES,

05:18.118 --> 05:20.554
SO IT'S NOT
THAT BIG OF A DEAL.

05:20.588 --> 05:23.591
IT I A BIG DEAL.

05:23.624 --> 05:26.026
IT CLEARLY MEANS A LOT
TO HIM THAT YOU'RE GOING.

05:26.059 --> 05:27.661
I JUST THINK PEOPLE
MAKE TOO MUCH

05:27.695 --> 05:29.129
OUT OF WEDDINGS
IN GENERAL.

05:29.162 --> 05:31.098
I MEAN, IF IT NEEDS
A TENT, IT'S A CIRCUS.

05:31.131 --> 05:32.733
SAYS THE GIRL WHO GOT UP
AT FOUR IN THE MORNING

05:32.766 --> 05:34.134
TO WATCH THE ROYAL WEDDING.

05:34.167 --> 05:37.605
I HAD TO PEE.
FOR THREE HOURS?

05:37.638 --> 05:39.673
LOOK, I KNOW THAT YOU ARE
THINKING ABOUT ME

05:39.707 --> 05:41.842
AND MY FEELINGS
ABOUT ALL OF THIS.

05:41.875 --> 05:43.444
I LOVE YOU FOR THAT.

05:43.477 --> 05:46.447
BUT THIS IS A DAY
OF HAPPINESS FOR YOUR DAD.

05:46.480 --> 05:47.981
I WANT YOU TO EMBRACE THAT,

05:48.015 --> 05:49.583
IN THE SAME WAY THAT
YOU WOULD EMBRACE IT

05:49.617 --> 05:52.486
IFFOUND SOMEONE.
OKAY?

05:53.754 --> 05:55.623
I'LL TRY.

05:55.656 --> 05:57.491
AREN'T YOU LATE FOR SCHOOL?

05:57.525 --> 05:59.927
OH, IT'S COLLEGE FAIR DAY.
ATTENDANCE IS OPTIONAL.

06:01.529 --> 06:02.863
OR NOT.

06:10.971 --> 06:12.406
CAN I TALK TO YOU?

06:12.440 --> 06:14.107
HEY, YEAH, LOOK.
I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU.

06:14.141 --> 06:16.109
WHY DO YOU HAVE
THOSE PICTURES OF ME?

06:16.143 --> 06:17.445
WHAT?

06:17.478 --> 06:18.712
MY FRIENDS SAID
THEY FOUND PICTURES

06:18.746 --> 06:20.047
THAT YOU TOOK
OF ME SLEEPING.

06:20.080 --> 06:21.649
HOW DID YOU EVEN TAKE THEM?

06:21.682 --> 06:24.184
DID YOU, LIKE, CLIMB
A LADDER UP TO MY WINDOW?

06:24.217 --> 06:27.555
HOLD UP. YOUR FRIENDS
ARE THE ONES WHO BROKE
INTO MY DARKROOM?

06:27.588 --> 06:28.956
SO WHAT?

06:28.989 --> 06:30.691
THE POINT IS,
THEY FOUND THE PHOTOS--

06:30.724 --> 06:31.925
PHOTOS YOU
DIDN'T WANT FOUND.

06:31.959 --> 06:35.929
MAN, I SWEAR,
THIS TOWN NEVER CHANGES.

06:35.963 --> 06:38.566
PEOPLE WOULD RATHER
SNEAK BEHIND YOUR BACK

06:38.599 --> 06:40.000
THAN ASK YOU
A DIRECT QUESTION.

06:40.033 --> 06:42.135
I'M ASKING YOU A DIRECT
QUESTION RIGHT NOW--

06:42.169 --> 06:43.637
WHY DID YOU TAKE THEM,
AND WHEN?

06:43.671 --> 06:46.774
I DIDN'T. ALI DID.

06:48.876 --> 06:51.712
WHY WOULD ALI TAKE
PICTURES OF ME SLEEPING?

06:51.745 --> 06:54.147
GOT ME. I DON'T KNOW
WHAT GOES ON AT
SLUMBER PARTIES.

06:54.181 --> 06:57.417
LOOK, I FOUND A ROLL
OF HER FILM IN THE HOUSE,
SO I DEVELOPED IT.

06:59.920 --> 07:02.456
OKAY, WELL, WHY WERE
ALL THE PICTURES MISSING

07:02.490 --> 07:03.891
WHEN MY FRIENDS
WENT BACK THERE?

07:03.924 --> 07:05.225
SPENCER SAID THE WHOLE
DARKROOM WAS GONE.

07:05.258 --> 07:07.060
THAT EQUIPMENT IS EXPENSIVE,

07:07.094 --> 07:09.162
SO I MOVED IT INTO THE HOUSE
UNTIL I COULD GET A NEW LOCK.

07:09.196 --> 07:11.665
AND THE PRINTS WERE GONE
BECAUSE I WAS HAVING
THEM FRAMED.

07:11.699 --> 07:14.034
AS A GIFT. FOR YOU.

07:16.637 --> 07:18.138
OH.

07:18.171 --> 07:19.773
SO...

07:19.807 --> 07:22.042
ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT
TO ACCUSE ME OF?

07:22.075 --> 07:24.912
( sighs )
JASON, YOU HAVE TO ADMIT,

07:24.945 --> 07:27.848
THIS ALL LOOKS REALLY BAD.

07:27.881 --> 07:30.718
YEAH.

07:30.751 --> 07:32.085
I CAN SEE THAT.

07:52.239 --> 07:53.941
ANN?
HI!

07:53.974 --> 07:55.208
WHAT BRINGS YOU HERE TODAY?

07:55.242 --> 07:57.678
I HAVE A MEETING
WITH YOUR PRINCIPAL.

07:57.711 --> 07:59.212
AN UPCOMING PRESENTATION.

07:59.246 --> 08:00.814
HOW'S ARIA?

08:00.848 --> 08:02.916
BETTER, I THINK.
THANK YOU.

08:02.950 --> 08:04.918
ACTUALLY, I WAS WONDERING
IF I COULD TALK TO YOU

08:04.952 --> 08:06.119
ABOUT MY SON, MIKE.

08:06.153 --> 08:07.788
OH, OKAY.

08:07.821 --> 08:09.990
HE GOES TO SCHOOL HERE.
HE'S 14,

08:10.023 --> 08:12.726
AND HE'S JUST BECOME
VERY WITHDRAWN--

08:12.760 --> 08:14.127
DOESN'T WANT
TO GO TO SCHOOL,

08:14.161 --> 08:17.598
HE DOESN'T REALLY
COME OUT OF HIS ROOM.

08:17.631 --> 08:19.867
AND HE WAS CAUGHT
BREAKING INTO A HOUSE.

08:19.900 --> 08:21.735
DID HE TALK TO YOU ABOUT IT?

08:21.769 --> 08:23.604
NO, HE WON'T TALK
TO ANYBODY,

08:23.637 --> 08:27.140
BUT I WAS HOPING THAT
HE MIGHT TALK TO YOU.

08:27.174 --> 08:28.842
WELL, I DON'T
USUALLY RECOMMEND

08:28.876 --> 08:32.011
THAT SIBLINGS SEE
THE SAME THERAPIST,

08:32.044 --> 08:33.614
BUT WHY DON'T I COME UP
WITH A FEW PEOPLE

08:33.647 --> 08:36.515
WHO MIGHT BE RIGHT FOR HIM?

08:40.654 --> 08:42.322
HEY!

08:42.355 --> 08:45.125
GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

08:45.158 --> 08:47.327
I'LL SEE YOU OVER THERE.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.863
SHALL WE GET THE OTHER
BOX FROM YOUR CAR?

08:49.897 --> 08:52.065
I WAS JUST THINKING

08:52.099 --> 08:53.667
WE COULD PUT ONE DOWN HERE,

08:53.701 --> 08:54.802
LET THE KIDS SCAVENGE
THROUGH THEM

08:54.835 --> 08:56.604
LIKE HUNGRY PIGEONS.

08:56.637 --> 08:59.339
WELL, YOU KNOW
THE STUDENT BODY
BETTER THAN I DO.

08:59.372 --> 09:00.708
HERE.

09:02.843 --> 09:04.978
I'LL HELP YOU.

09:14.722 --> 09:16.223
EM. HEY.

09:16.256 --> 09:18.225
I WANTED TO GIVE YOU
THIS BEFORE I LEAVE.

09:18.258 --> 09:20.694
LEAVE? AREN'T WE
CHECKING OUT BOOTHS TOGETHER?

09:20.728 --> 09:22.863
NO, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I JUST HAD TO GO TO
THAT STUPID FITTING

09:22.896 --> 09:24.598
FOR MY BRIDESMAID'S
DRESS.

09:24.632 --> 09:26.734
WHAT'S THIS?

09:26.767 --> 09:28.636
A FREE MASSAGE.

09:28.669 --> 09:30.203
MY MOM SAYS
YOU NEED TO RELAX.

09:30.237 --> 09:31.939
I AM RELAXED.

09:31.972 --> 09:34.908
YOU CAN'T EVEN TURN
YOUR HEAD. USE IT.

09:34.942 --> 09:38.679
ANYWAYS, I GOTTA GO.
MONA'S WAITING FOR ME
OUTSIDE.

09:41.782 --> 09:43.350
( laughter )
OH, MY GOD,
THAT WAS HILARIOUS!

09:43.383 --> 09:45.118
I KNOW!

09:45.152 --> 09:46.754
ARE WE HANGING OUT
AT MY HOUSE BEFORE
THE MEET?

09:46.787 --> 09:48.288
I'M THERE.
ME TOO. WHAT TIME?

09:48.321 --> 09:50.658
NINE. BRING BREAKFAST.
OR CUPCAKES!

09:50.691 --> 09:52.993
( laughter )

10:07.240 --> 10:09.910
EMILY?

10:11.411 --> 10:13.981
THANK YOU.

10:14.014 --> 10:15.315
NO PROBLEM.

10:19.119 --> 10:20.387
EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

10:24.858 --> 10:26.960
NO.

10:26.994 --> 10:28.896
CAN I HELP?

10:30.864 --> 10:32.232
I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE THINKING:

10:32.265 --> 10:33.701
THAT I COULDN'T POSSIBLY
UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEMS

10:33.734 --> 10:35.035
YOU'RE DEALING WITH
RIGHT NOW,

10:35.068 --> 10:36.904
BUT I MIGHT SURPRISE YOU
IF YOU GIVE ME A CHANCE.

10:40.007 --> 10:41.441
JUST BECAUSE YOU STOPPED
BEING MY PATIENT

10:41.474 --> 10:45.212
DOESN'T MEAN I STOPPED
CARING ABOUT YOU.

10:51.919 --> 10:56.857
THERE ARE THINGS THAT
WE... I... HAVEN'T TOLD YOU.

10:59.192 --> 11:01.128
AND I NEED TO.

11:03.731 --> 11:06.299
WHY DON'T WE DO THIS
IN MY OFFICE?

11:06.333 --> 11:08.802
DO YOU HAVE ANY TIME
AFTER SCHOOL TODAY?

11:08.836 --> 11:10.137
YEAH.

11:14.207 --> 11:16.777
SO, THIS IS WEIRD, HUH?

11:16.810 --> 11:18.779
BOXING UP SOMEONE'S LIFE.

11:18.812 --> 11:21.181
THIS IS IAN
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

11:21.214 --> 11:23.984
I THINK THIS JUST BECAME
MY FONDEST MEMORY OF HIM.

11:26.353 --> 11:29.723
SO, I KNOW WHY I'M NOT
GOING TO THE COLLEGE FAIR.

11:29.757 --> 11:32.392
WHY AREN'T YOU THERE?
'CAUSE I WENT LAST YEAR.

11:32.425 --> 11:35.095
YOU'VE PROBABLY BEEN GOING
SINCE MIDDLE SCHOOL, RIGHT?

11:35.128 --> 11:36.964
WELL, YOU KNOW
THE HASTINGS MOTTO--

11:36.997 --> 11:40.067
"WHY ENJOY TODAY
WHEN YOU COULD BE
WORRYING ABOUT TOMORROW?"

11:46.139 --> 11:48.108
HEY, CHECK THIS OUT.

11:48.141 --> 11:49.943
IAN'S OLD YEARBOOK.

12:00.888 --> 12:02.089
WAIT, STOP.
THERE HE IS.

12:03.323 --> 12:04.858
"CAPTAIN OF
THE LACROSSE TEAM.

12:04.892 --> 12:06.860
HONORS SOCIETY.
DRAMA CLUB."

12:06.894 --> 12:09.863
YEAH, HE WAS
QUITE THE ACTOR.

12:09.897 --> 12:14.167
"N.A.T. CLUB"?
WHAT'S THAT?

12:14.201 --> 12:15.769
NEVER HEARD OF IT.

12:15.803 --> 12:17.170
YEAH, NEITHER HAVE I,
AND I KNOW EVERY CLUB.

12:17.204 --> 12:20.073
I CAME CLOSE TO JOINING
THE MADRIGALS!

12:20.107 --> 12:21.408
LET-- LET ME SEE THIS.

12:24.111 --> 12:26.079
IT'S NOT IN
THE INDEX OF CLUBS.

12:27.547 --> 12:30.317
SO MAYBE IT WAS
SOME KIND OF MISTAKE.

12:30.350 --> 12:32.519
OKAY, THEN,
HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THAT?

12:34.287 --> 12:37.825
"IAN-- N.A.T. FOREVER.
JASON."

12:37.858 --> 12:40.160
DiLAURENTIS?

12:45.232 --> 12:47.767
"JASON DiLAURENTIS.
N.A.T. CLUB."

12:50.370 --> 12:52.105
SPENC-- SPENCER,
WHAT IS IT?

12:52.139 --> 12:55.175
I JUST WANT TO SEE IF
ANYONE ELSE WAS A MEMBER.

12:59.012 --> 13:01.915
GARRETT REYNOLDS.

13:01.949 --> 13:04.051
N.A.T. CLUB.

13:11.291 --> 13:12.960
Woman: DO YOU WANT
A BUMPER STICKER, OR...?

13:16.063 --> 13:18.031
Ezra: INTERESTED
IN WRITING?

13:18.065 --> 13:19.967
THIS PRETTY MUCH
LAYS EVERYTHING OUT.

13:20.000 --> 13:24.104
PLEASE TAKE A PEN.
WE HAVE SO MANY! YEAH.

13:24.137 --> 13:26.874
WE CAN'T USUALLY...
USE ALL THESE.

13:26.907 --> 13:28.876
( indistinct chatter
continues )

13:28.909 --> 13:32.379
I THINK THAT
MY FRIEND JACKIE ALSO, UH...

13:34.614 --> 13:36.917
I TELL YOU WHAT.
I'LL BE-- I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

13:36.950 --> 13:38.318
I'M JUST GONNA--

13:42.956 --> 13:44.124
WHA--? MS. MONTGOMERY!

13:44.157 --> 13:46.626
HAVE YOU CONSIDERED
HOLLIS COLLEGE?

13:46.659 --> 13:48.929
THEY HAVE A WONDERFUL
ARTS PROGRAM,

13:48.962 --> 13:53.233
AND I THINK YOU'LL FIND
THE TEACHERS ARE VERY
HANDS-ON, AND...

13:55.202 --> 13:57.304
ARIA?

13:59.239 --> 14:02.075
ARIA, WAIT. WHAT'S UP?
ARE YOU MAD AT ME?

14:02.109 --> 14:04.945
NO, I'M NOT MAD AT YOU.

14:04.978 --> 14:06.513
I'M WORRIED ABOUT US.

14:06.546 --> 14:11.218
I JUST FEEL LIKE
OUTSIDE FORCES ARE
KIND OF TAKING OVER.

14:11.251 --> 14:13.954
FORCES?
PEOPLE.

14:13.987 --> 14:16.256
ARIA, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE TO TELL YOU

14:16.289 --> 14:18.525
TO PROVE THAT
JACKIE'S NOT A THREAT.

14:18.558 --> 14:21.294
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU WOULDN'T KNOW A THREAT
IF IT SAT IN YOUR LAP

14:21.328 --> 14:22.662
AND MADE YOU A GIN AND TONIC!

14:22.695 --> 14:24.131
WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?

14:24.164 --> 14:26.266
IT MEANS THAT JACKIE
IS INTERESTED IN YOU.

14:26.299 --> 14:28.068
SHE FLIRTS WITH YOU
EVERY SINGLE DAY.

14:28.101 --> 14:30.370
I-I JUST SAW.
ARIA, I WORK WITH THE WOMAN.

14:30.403 --> 14:33.306
( sighs )
LOOK, I'M NOT BLAMING HER.

14:33.340 --> 14:34.674
OKAY, IT'S NOT HER FAULT.

14:34.707 --> 14:36.543
WE'VE LEFT OURSELVES
OPEN TO THAT

14:36.576 --> 14:39.046
BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T
KNOW THAT YOU'RE
IN A RELATIONSHIP--

14:39.079 --> 14:41.681
THE SAME WAY THAT
NO ONE KNOWS THAT
 I'M IN A RELATIONSHIP.

14:41.714 --> 14:44.551
YEAH, BUT IT'S NOT A PROBLEM
AS LONG AS WE KNOW.

14:44.584 --> 14:47.020
I MEANT IT WHEN I SAID
I DIDN'T HAVE FEELINGS
FOR HER.

14:47.054 --> 14:49.422
WELL, I MEANT IT
WHEN I SAID I DIDN'T
HAVE FEELINGS FOR JASON,

14:49.456 --> 14:52.025
BUT THAT DIDN'T STOP ME
FROM KISSING HIM.

14:54.394 --> 14:59.399
WAIT. THAT-- THAT
CAME OUT ENTIRELY WRONG.

14:59.432 --> 15:01.534
I DIDN'T KISS HIM;
HE KISSED ME.

15:01.568 --> 15:04.972
I JUST...
I DIDN'T STOP HIM.

15:05.005 --> 15:08.008
Jackie: HEY, E-Z,

15:08.041 --> 15:10.543
CAN YOU GET THOSE
LAST BOX OF BROCHURES
OUT OF THE CAR?

15:10.577 --> 15:13.413
I DON'T WANT
TO LEAVE THE BOOTH.

15:13.446 --> 15:14.914
YEAH. SURE.

15:23.123 --> 15:25.625
COLLEGE WILL BE
A GREAT EXPERIENCE FOR YOU.

15:25.658 --> 15:27.294
IT REALLY
HELPS YOU GROW UP.

15:27.327 --> 15:29.629
REALLY?

15:29.662 --> 15:33.200
YOU'LL LOOK BACK AND REALIZE
JUST HOW NAIVE YOU WERE.

15:49.316 --> 15:51.284
SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

15:51.318 --> 15:54.021
HOLD ON. LET ME STOP
DRY-HEAVING FIRST.

15:54.054 --> 15:55.688
OKAY, IT'S NOT THAT BAD.

15:55.722 --> 15:58.058
KATE MOSS WOULD LOOK
LIKE A WATER BUFFALO IN THAT.

15:58.091 --> 16:00.460
ALL YOU'RE MISSING IS CUD.

16:00.493 --> 16:02.996
I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN,
IF I TIGHTEN THE WAIST

16:03.030 --> 16:04.397
AND SHORTEN IT A BIT,

16:04.431 --> 16:06.333
I THINK IT WOULD ACTUALLY
BE REALLY CUTE.

16:06.366 --> 16:08.501
SERIOUSLY? WHO IS THIS
HILLBILLY YOUR DAD IS MARRYING?

16:08.535 --> 16:11.471
HER NAME IS ISABEL,
AND CAN YOU EASE UP?

16:11.504 --> 16:13.073
SO HER TASTE IS
A LITTLE MORE CLASSIC.

16:13.106 --> 16:15.208
YEAH-- CLASSIC UGLY.

16:15.242 --> 16:16.609
AND YOU KNOW THAT.

16:16.643 --> 16:18.645
SO WHY ARE YOU
CHANNELING POLLYANNA?

16:18.678 --> 16:20.280
POLLY WHO?

16:20.313 --> 16:22.515
OKAY, YOU KNOW,
IT'S IMPORTANT TO MY DAD,

16:22.549 --> 16:25.152
AND, I DON'T KNOW,
I WASN'T EXACTLY A CHARMER

16:25.185 --> 16:26.786
THE FIRST TIME
I MET KATE AND ISABEL,

16:26.819 --> 16:29.522
AND I NEED TO MAKE IT
UP TO THEM.

16:29.556 --> 16:32.359
SO IF THAT MEANS
I'M STANDING UP THERE
LOOKING LIKE SASQUATCH,

16:32.392 --> 16:34.394
THEN SO BE IT.

16:34.427 --> 16:36.096
FINE, I GET IT.

16:36.129 --> 16:39.099
BE NICE TO HER
IF YOU HAVE TO,
BUT LET'S FACE IT--

16:39.132 --> 16:41.434
YOUR STEPMOM-TO-BE
IS A JUG-BLOWING HAYSEED,

16:41.468 --> 16:43.103
AND SO IS
HER DAUGHTER KATE.

16:43.136 --> 16:44.337
HANNA?

16:45.838 --> 16:48.375
KATE! OH, HI.

16:48.408 --> 16:51.044
I WISH I HAD KNOWN
YOU WERE COMING
FOR A FITTING.

16:51.078 --> 16:52.579
MY MOM JUST LEFT.

16:52.612 --> 16:54.447
WE ALL COULD HAVE TRIED ON
OUR DRESSES TOGETHER.

16:54.481 --> 16:56.383
THAT'S TOO BAD.
THAT WOULD HAVE
BEEN REALLY FUN.

16:56.416 --> 16:57.784
OH, MY GOD!

16:57.817 --> 16:59.786
IS THAT THE NEW
REBECCA MINKOFF?

16:59.819 --> 17:01.821
I THOUGHT THEY WERE,
LIKE, TOTALLY SOLD OUT.

17:01.854 --> 17:03.590
THEY ARE.

17:03.623 --> 17:07.359
UM, KATE, THIS IS
MY FRIEND MONA.

17:07.394 --> 17:09.296
HI.
PLEASURE.

17:09.329 --> 17:12.499
SO, WHAT ARE THE CHANCES
OF ME RUNNING INTO YOU TODAY?

17:12.531 --> 17:15.301
LIKE, ONE IN A MILLION?
WHY AREN'T YOU AT SCHOOL?

17:15.335 --> 17:17.170
EXAMS. ALL MY CLASSES
ARE A.P.,

17:17.204 --> 17:19.106
SO I TOOK MINE EARLY.
HOW 'BOUT YOU?

17:19.138 --> 17:21.141
UH, COLLEGE FAIR.

17:21.174 --> 17:23.343
BUT I'M GONNA PICK OUT
MY COLLEGE THE SAME WAY
I PICK OUT MY CLOTHES--

17:23.376 --> 17:25.112
FROM A CATALOG.

17:25.145 --> 17:26.613
THAT'S FUNNY.

17:29.216 --> 17:31.451
UH, LISTEN, UM,
MY OLDER COUSINS AND I

17:31.484 --> 17:33.853
ARE MEETING LATER AT
A CLUB FOR SOME LUNCH.

17:33.886 --> 17:35.322
WHY DON'T BOTH OF YOU
JOIN US?

17:35.355 --> 17:37.090
OH, WE CAN'T.
OH, I'M STARVED!

17:37.124 --> 17:39.492
GREAT. I'M GONNA
GO WRITE DOWN
THE DIRECTIONS,

17:39.526 --> 17:41.294
AND I WILL BE BACK IN A SEC.

17:44.264 --> 17:46.233
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
YOU ARE NOT STARVED!

17:46.266 --> 17:47.767
YOU JUST HAD A WHOLE
BOWL OF JELLYBEANS.

17:47.800 --> 17:49.136
THEY WERE COMPLIMENTARY.

17:49.169 --> 17:52.139
WE'RE NOT GOING.
YES, WE ARE!

17:52.172 --> 17:54.141
YOU SAID YOU NEEDED
TO MAKE NICE WITH HER.

17:54.174 --> 17:56.075
NOW'S YOUR CHANCE.

18:00.413 --> 18:02.549
SO, TAKE YOUR TIME
AND GET COMFORTABLE.

18:05.818 --> 18:09.189
YOU CAN LIE FACEDOWN
BETWEEN THE SHEETS
WHEN YOU'RE READY.

18:09.222 --> 18:10.490
SURE.

18:13.326 --> 18:14.427
FIRST TIME?

18:14.461 --> 18:16.529
THAT OBVIOUS, HUH?

18:16.563 --> 18:19.132
TRUST ME, YOU'LL LOVE IT.

18:19.166 --> 18:21.401
YOU LET ME KNOW
IF THE PRESSURE'S RIGHT.

18:21.434 --> 18:23.436
WE'LL START EASY
AND SEE WHERE YOU'RE TENDER.

18:23.470 --> 18:25.205
I'LL BE BACK
IN A FEW MINUTES, OKAY?

18:25.238 --> 18:26.406
OKAY.

18:28.208 --> 18:29.676
( door closes )

18:31.878 --> 18:34.447
I JUST CHECKED
A BUNCH OF OLD YEARBOOKS.

18:34.481 --> 18:36.449
THAT CLUB ISN'T MENTIONED
IN ANY OF THEM.

18:36.483 --> 18:39.186
I CHECKED TOO. IT MUST
BE SOME KIND OF PRANK.

18:39.219 --> 18:41.621
WHAT, LIKE SENIORS
GET AWAY WITH MURDER?

18:41.654 --> 18:45.392
THERE'S GOT TO BE AN ANSWER
IN ALL OF THIS STUFF.

18:45.425 --> 18:47.794
I MEAN, JASON, IAN,
AND GARRETT?

18:47.827 --> 18:49.396
"N.A.T. CLUB"?

18:49.429 --> 18:51.198
IT'S GOT
TO MEAN SOMETHING!

18:51.231 --> 18:56.269
WHAT'S A NICE WAY TO SAY
SOMEONE'S OBSESSIVE?

19:03.376 --> 19:05.412
WAIT A MINUTE.
CHECK THIS OUT.

19:06.546 --> 19:08.248
NOS ANIMADVERTO TOTUS.

19:08.281 --> 19:10.383
"N.A.T."

19:13.620 --> 19:15.188
YOU TOOK LATIN, RIGHT?

19:15.222 --> 19:16.456
YEAH, AND I GOT
A FIVE ON MY A.P.,

19:16.489 --> 19:18.491
BUT I DON'T REMEMBER
ANY OF IT.

19:23.263 --> 19:25.365
"WE SEE ALL."

19:26.899 --> 19:28.301
"WE SEE ALL."

19:28.335 --> 19:30.337
"WE SEE ALL."

19:30.370 --> 19:32.739
WAIT. WE KNOW THAT IAN
LIKED TO SECRETLY VIDEOTAPE

19:32.772 --> 19:34.341
THE GIRLS OF ROSEWOOD,
RIGHT?

19:34.374 --> 19:36.543
UH... YEAH.

19:36.576 --> 19:37.944
WELL, WHAT IF
"WE SEE ALL"

19:37.977 --> 19:39.779
MEANS THAT JASON
AND GARRETT WERE IN

19:39.812 --> 19:41.281
ON HIS DIRTY LITTLE GAME?

19:41.314 --> 19:42.682
BUT WHAT WOULD THAT MEAN,

19:42.715 --> 19:44.284
OTHER THAN THAT
THEY WERE PERVERTS?

19:44.317 --> 19:45.885
IT MEANS THAT MAYBE
JASON KILLED ALISON

19:45.918 --> 19:48.655
FOR THE SAME REASON
WE THOUGHT IAN DID:

19:48.688 --> 19:50.923
TO GET BACK THOSE TAPES.

19:50.957 --> 19:55.562
( indistinct chatter )

19:56.663 --> 19:59.799
MIND IF I SIT DOWN?

19:59.832 --> 20:01.501
UH...

20:01.534 --> 20:03.670
OH, COME ON,
YOU'RE NOT STILL
SCARED OF ME, ARE YOU?

20:11.711 --> 20:13.746
( horse whinnying )

20:15.448 --> 20:18.551
OKAY, ARE WE EATING HAY?
BECAUSE I WAS PROMISED LUNCH.

20:18.585 --> 20:20.320
SO THE PLAN CHANGED.

20:20.353 --> 20:22.322
YEAH, BECAUSE YOU HAD
TO OPEN YOUR BIG MOUTH

20:22.355 --> 20:24.324
AND MENTION YOUR AMAZING
SUMMER AT EQUESTRIAN CAMP--

20:24.357 --> 20:25.825
WHICH, BY THE WAY,
WAS NEWS TO ME.

20:25.858 --> 20:27.860
OKAY, HOW WAS I SUPPOSED
TO KNOW THAT KATE

20:27.894 --> 20:29.896
WOULD OFFER
TO TAKE US RIDING?

20:29.929 --> 20:31.764
ANYWAYS,
THIS'LL BE FUN!

20:31.798 --> 20:35.602
PLUS, OKAY,
HOW MUCH ARE YOU
LOVING THESE OUTFITS?

20:35.635 --> 20:37.003
I DON'T KNOW.

20:37.036 --> 20:39.472
THESE JODHPURS
ARE CUTTING OFF
MY CIRCULATION.

20:39.506 --> 20:40.773
Kate: HEY!

20:40.807 --> 20:43.510
I'M OVER HERE!
CAN YOU GRAB THOSE HELMETS?

20:43.543 --> 20:45.845
YEAH. SURE THING.

20:48.615 --> 20:49.882
WHO'S ELIZABETH?

20:49.916 --> 20:51.284
I AM.

20:52.385 --> 20:53.986
YOU CAN CALL HER BITSY.

20:57.390 --> 20:58.891
SO, YOU MUST BE "MARG-OX."

20:58.925 --> 21:01.260
IT'S MARGEAUX.
THE "X" IS SILENT.

21:02.729 --> 21:05.565
( asks question in French )

21:05.598 --> 21:07.734
( responds in French )

21:10.603 --> 21:12.939
SO, HANNA,
HAVE YOU RIDDEN
ENGLISH BEFORE?

21:12.972 --> 21:15.808
OH, NO, I'M STILL
LEARNING AMERICAN.

21:15.842 --> 21:16.943
YOU MEAN WESTERN.

21:16.976 --> 21:18.878
WHAT?

21:18.911 --> 21:21.514
( laughing )
HANNA, YOU'RE TOO MUCH!

21:24.984 --> 21:27.019
OH. READY?
YOU BET.

21:27.053 --> 21:28.921
( hoofbeats approaching )

21:30.657 --> 21:32.892
WHOA. THIS THING IS,
UH...

21:32.925 --> 21:35.094
BIGGER THAN I THOUGHT.

21:35.127 --> 21:37.730
LIKE, EXTINCT ANIMAL BIG.

21:45.472 --> 21:46.739
( horse whinnying )

21:49.742 --> 21:52.479
IF YOU DON'T FEEL
COMFORTABLE RIDING,

21:52.512 --> 21:54.447
WE CAN ALWAYS
HANG OUT ANOTHER TIME.

21:55.782 --> 21:57.684
OH, SHE'LL BE FINE.

21:57.717 --> 21:59.486
WHY DON'T YOU GIRLS
GO ON AHEAD

21:59.519 --> 22:01.954
AND WE'LL JOIN YOU.
I'LL SHOW HANNA THE ROPES.

22:01.988 --> 22:04.357
ALL RIGHT.
ARE YOU SURE?

22:04.391 --> 22:07.360
SERIOUSLY, I'M LIKE
THE HORSE WHISPERER.

22:07.394 --> 22:09.095
OKAY.

22:28.815 --> 22:30.116
( sighs )

22:42.495 --> 22:44.464
THAT FEELS GREAT.

22:51.604 --> 22:52.972
THESE ARE BEAUTIFUL.

22:53.005 --> 22:54.574
Jason: YEAH.

22:54.607 --> 22:56.709
I DIDN'T KNOW
ALI WAS SO ARTISTIC.

22:56.743 --> 22:59.045
I BARELY REMEMBER HER
EVEN TAKING PICTURES.

23:01.013 --> 23:04.016
IT'S... STRANGE.

23:04.050 --> 23:06.953
STILL GETTING
TO KNOW SOMEONE
AFTER THEY'RE GONE.

23:09.155 --> 23:10.990
NERVOUS?

23:11.023 --> 23:12.592
OH...

23:12.625 --> 23:14.961
IT'S A BAD HABIT.

23:16.729 --> 23:22.168
LOOK, I KNOW THIS...
ISN'T AN EXCUSE, BUT...

23:22.201 --> 23:24.737
MY FRIENDS BROKE IN
BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN
THROUGH A LOT.

23:26.806 --> 23:30.176
I THINK WE'RE ALL
LOOKING FOR ANSWERS.

23:30.209 --> 23:32.579
THAT'S HOW I FOUND
THIS ROLL OF FILM
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

23:32.612 --> 23:34.514
WHERE DID YOU FIND IT?

23:34.547 --> 23:36.783
I WAS DOING RENOVATIONS
IN ALI'S ROOM.

23:36.816 --> 23:40.052
I PULLED UP HER
FLOORBOARD AND FOUND
A BOX OF HER STUFF.

23:40.086 --> 23:41.621
WHAT ELSE WAS IN THE BOX?

23:43.155 --> 23:44.957
NOTHING SPECIAL.
GIRL STUFF.

23:46.959 --> 23:50.062
WELL... THEN WHY
WOULD SHE HIDE IT?

23:50.096 --> 23:53.199
I DON'T KNOW.

23:53.232 --> 23:55.902
HIDING THINGS BECAME
SUCH SECOND NATURE FOR HER,

23:55.935 --> 23:59.839
I DON'T THINK SHE EVEN
KNEW WHY SHE WAS DOING
IT HALF THE TIME.

23:59.872 --> 24:03.209
SOMETHING BECOMES A HABIT,
IT'S HARD TO STOP,
YOU KNOW?

24:05.545 --> 24:07.179
SO, UM...

24:07.213 --> 24:09.081
HAVE YOU FOUND
ANYTHING ELSE OF HERS?

24:10.817 --> 24:12.552
NO. JUST THE BOX.

24:15.622 --> 24:17.790
YOU CAN TAKE A LOOK
AT IT, IF YOU WANT.
IT'S BACK AT THE HOUSE.

24:21.794 --> 24:24.230
OR YOU CAN JUST WAIT
FOR THE NEXT BREAK-IN

24:24.263 --> 24:26.065
FROM YOUR CIRCLE
OF FRIENDS AND RELATIVES.

24:35.675 --> 24:37.810
( indistinct chatter )

24:40.747 --> 24:43.750
SHOULDN'T WE GO IN THERE
AND TALK TO HER?

24:45.818 --> 24:50.089
ARIA WON'T LISTEN
TO ANYTHING ELSE THAT I
HAVE TO SAY ABOUT JASON.

24:50.122 --> 24:52.992
BUT I KNOW WHO
SHE WI LISTEN TO.

24:58.097 --> 24:59.666
OH. OW.

24:59.699 --> 25:01.634
HUH! CAN'T BE
MUCH FURTHER.

25:05.972 --> 25:07.239
HOW'S YOUR ANKLE?

25:10.843 --> 25:12.545
THAT WAS SO WEIRD.

25:12.579 --> 25:14.046
I'VE NEVER
SEEN ONE BITE BEFORE.

25:14.080 --> 25:15.815
WE LOST KATE'S HORSES!

25:15.848 --> 25:18.250
THEY'LL FIND THEIR WAY BACK.
THEY'RE LIKE BIG DOGS.

25:18.284 --> 25:19.986
I'VE TOLD YOU THIS BEFORE.

25:20.019 --> 25:23.856
DID YOU EVER EVEN GO
TO RIDING CAMP?

25:23.890 --> 25:25.858
SO I EMBELLISHED
A LITTLE BIT.

25:27.927 --> 25:30.162
LOOK, HANNA,
THE KEY TO SURVIVAL

25:30.196 --> 25:32.765
OF ANY SPECIES
IS ADAPTABILITY.

25:32.799 --> 25:34.901
WHOA! WHEN THERE'S
A NUCLEAR WAR,

25:34.934 --> 25:37.704
I GUESS IT'S GOING TO
BE MONA AND A MILLION
COCKROACHES,

25:37.737 --> 25:40.239
BECAUSE YOU EVEN
HADFOOLED.

25:40.272 --> 25:41.874
WHY ARE YOU MAD?

25:41.908 --> 25:44.110
THE ONLY REASON I'M
EVEN HERE IS FOR YOU.

25:44.143 --> 25:46.345
I'VE BEEN WORKING IT
ALL DAY TO HELP YOU GET
IN GOOD WITH THESE GIRLS.

25:46.378 --> 25:48.948
WHO ARE YOU TRYING
TO HELP HERE--
ME OR YOURSELF?

25:50.182 --> 25:52.785
WHAT IS
THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

25:52.819 --> 25:54.687
I JUST COULDN'T HELP
BUT NOTICE

25:54.721 --> 25:57.323
THAT ONCE YOU FOUND OUT
KATE WAS MORE COUNTRY CLUB
THAN HILLBILLY,

25:57.356 --> 26:00.593
YOU COULDN'T WAIT
TO SPEND THE DAY
WITH HER AND HER CREW.

26:02.729 --> 26:03.930
WHATEVER.

26:03.963 --> 26:06.933
I HOPE CALEB COMES BACK SOON

26:06.966 --> 26:09.869
'CAUSE EVER SINCE HE LEFT,
YOU'VE BEEN A TOTAL CRANK.

26:15.107 --> 26:17.243
Masseuse:
READY TO BEGIN?

26:17.276 --> 26:19.345
WHAT?

26:19.378 --> 26:22.014
MY APOLOGIES.
SCHEDULING ISSUE.

26:22.048 --> 26:25.084
I'LL TACK ON
AN EXTRA 10 MINUTES.

26:25.117 --> 26:27.820
WAIT. WEREN'T YOU
JUST IN HERE?

26:27.854 --> 26:29.221
NO.

26:29.255 --> 26:30.790
SOMEONE WAS IN HERE.

26:36.729 --> 26:39.331
( Emily gasping )

26:49.909 --> 26:53.880
SPENCER, DO YOU...
NEED A RIDE OR SOMETHING?

26:53.913 --> 26:57.016
I HAVE TO TALK TO YOU.

26:57.049 --> 26:59.285
OKAY, THERE'S SOMETHING
THAT I NEED TO TELL YOU,

26:59.318 --> 27:01.353
BUT... BEFORE I TELL
YOU THAT, THERE'S...

27:01.387 --> 27:03.422
THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE
THAT I NEED TO TELL YOU.

27:03.455 --> 27:04.791
OKAY.

27:04.824 --> 27:05.958
I KNOW ABOUT YOU AND ARIA.

27:07.326 --> 27:08.895
EXCUSE ME?

27:08.928 --> 27:11.898
EZRA, YOU DON'T--
SORRY. MR. FITZ.

27:11.931 --> 27:14.166
BETTER. THANK YOU.
LISTEN TO ME.

27:14.200 --> 27:17.036
ARIA'S IN DANGER.

27:17.069 --> 27:21.808
OKAY, SHE HAS BEEN
HANGING OUT WITH
JASON DiLAURENTIS...

27:43.129 --> 27:44.430
( chime )

28:03.349 --> 28:06.452
UH... ACTUALLY,
THE BOX IS IN
THE WOODSHED.

28:06.485 --> 28:08.420
FOLLOW ME.

28:12.491 --> 28:13.860
YOU COMING?

28:13.893 --> 28:16.395
UM... NO, NO.

28:16.428 --> 28:18.731
I'LL JUST WAIT
OUT HERE FOR YOU.

28:18.765 --> 28:20.132
OKAY.

28:20.166 --> 28:32.344
I'LL BE BACK IN A SEC.

28:32.378 --> 28:34.280
WHAT A COMPLETE
WASTE OF TIME!

28:37.516 --> 28:39.351
( horse whinnying )

28:41.253 --> 28:44.223
I'M SORRY I SNAPPED AT YOU.

28:44.256 --> 28:47.259
YOU DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING WRONG.
IT'S JUST...

28:47.293 --> 28:49.061
KATE AND HER FRIENDS
THINK I'M TOTALLY CLUELESS.

28:51.430 --> 28:54.433
THAT'S NOT TRUE.
YES, IT IS.

28:54.466 --> 28:56.035
EVERY TIME I LOOKED
BACK AT THEM,

28:56.068 --> 28:57.269
I GOT THE STINK-EYE
FROM ITSY.

28:57.303 --> 29:00.272
BITSY.
WHATEVER.

29:00.306 --> 29:02.108
THEY BOTH HATED ME.

29:02.141 --> 29:03.542
HANNA...

29:03.575 --> 29:05.277
MAYBE YOU'RE JUST NOT
TRYING HARD ENOUGH.

29:05.311 --> 29:07.279
WHAT?

29:07.313 --> 29:08.881
MONA, HOW COULD
YOU SAY THAT?

29:08.915 --> 29:10.883
I PRACTICALLY
KILLED MYSELF TODAY

29:10.917 --> 29:12.284
TRYING TO MAKE THOSE
GIRLS LIKE ME.

29:12.318 --> 29:13.886
WHY SHOULD I
EVEN TRY AT ALL?

29:13.920 --> 29:15.487
IF IT WEREN'T FOR
"ISA-HELL" THE SKANK,

29:15.521 --> 29:18.024
MY MOM WOULD BE
WITH MY DAD RIGHT NOW
INSTEAD OF HOME ALONE,

29:18.057 --> 29:20.159
SO KATE, HER MOM,
AND THOSE LITTLE BITCHES

29:20.192 --> 29:22.829
CAN GO TO HELL,
FOR ALL I CARE.

29:22.862 --> 29:25.031
Ahem.

29:25.064 --> 29:26.365
HANNA...

29:44.851 --> 29:46.018
KATE.

29:54.260 --> 29:55.862
NO, KATE, WAIT.

30:01.400 --> 30:02.902
( gasps )

30:04.403 --> 30:05.938
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

30:07.006 --> 30:08.207
YOUR MOTHER LET ME IN.

30:10.476 --> 30:13.045
I THOUGHT
WE HAD AN AGREEMENT,

30:13.079 --> 30:16.048
BUT YOU DON'T SEEM
TO... CARE...

30:16.082 --> 30:17.516
ABOUT THAT ANYMORE.

30:19.919 --> 30:21.287
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

30:21.320 --> 30:22.521
IAN'S DEAD.

30:22.554 --> 30:24.423
ALISON'S MURDER
HAS BEEN SOLVED,

30:24.456 --> 30:26.893
BUT YOU'RE STILL DIGGING--

30:26.926 --> 30:30.897
DIGGING LIKE THE HUNGRY
TERRIER YOU ALWAYS
REMINDED ME OF.

30:30.930 --> 30:34.300
GREAT. I GOT IT.

30:34.333 --> 30:38.004
NOW, WHY DON'T YOU LEAVE?
I KNOW TOBY'S HELPING YOU.

30:39.972 --> 30:44.243
I KNOW HE WAS GOING
THROUGH MY ROOM.

30:44.276 --> 30:46.245
YOU NEED TO STOP.

30:46.278 --> 30:48.314
WHAT YOU'RE DOING
IS DANGEROUS FOR YOU

30:48.347 --> 30:50.049
AND FOR TOBY.

30:50.082 --> 30:52.084
YOU EXPECT ME TO BELIEVE
THAT YOU CARE ABOUT TOBY?

30:52.118 --> 30:54.620
I DO CARE ABOUT HIM.

30:54.653 --> 30:59.458
RIGHT. WELL, I KNOW
ALL ABOUT THAT, REMEMBER?

31:02.128 --> 31:03.562
WELL.

31:03.595 --> 31:05.431
I GUESS I'VE SAID
ALL I HAVE TO SAY.

31:05.464 --> 31:06.933
THANKS FOR STOPPING BY.

31:11.670 --> 31:14.206
AND TELL GARRETT I SAID HI.

31:30.322 --> 31:32.091
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

31:33.659 --> 31:35.995
I CAME TO GET YOU.

31:39.498 --> 31:41.467
SPENCER THOUGHT
AFTER YOU LEFT THE GRILL...

31:41.500 --> 31:43.602
SPENCER?
YOU TALKED TO SPENCER?

31:43.635 --> 31:47.173
SHE TALKED TO ME,
AND SHE ADMITTED THAT
SHE KNEW ABOUT US.

31:47.206 --> 31:49.976
SHE TOLD YOU ABOUT US?
WHY WOULD SHE DO THAT?

31:50.009 --> 31:52.244
BECAUSE YOUR FRIENDS
THINK THIS GUY JASON
IS DANGEROUS,

31:52.278 --> 31:54.380
AND I DO TOO.
THEY TOLD ME
ABOUT THE PHOTOS.

31:54.413 --> 31:57.316
HE HAD A LEGITIMATE
EXPLANATION FOR
THE PHOTOS.

31:57.349 --> 32:00.452
LOOK, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO WORRY.
HE'S NOT A THREAT.

32:00.486 --> 32:02.154
HE IS TO ME.

32:05.091 --> 32:06.292
I DON'T WANT TO LOSE YOU.

32:07.759 --> 32:10.462
LOOK... WE STARTED OUT
HIDING THIS RELATIONSHIP

32:10.496 --> 32:12.965
SO WE COULD HAVE ONE,

32:12.999 --> 32:14.633
BUT IF KEEPING IT A SECRET
IS DESTROYING IT,

32:14.666 --> 32:16.635
THEN I DON'T WANT
TO KEEP IT A SECRET
ANYMORE.

32:16.668 --> 32:19.671
SO, WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

32:19.705 --> 32:22.574
IT'S TIME
TO TELL PEOPLE ABOUT US,

32:22.608 --> 32:26.545
AND I THINK WE SHOULD START
BY TELLING YOUR PARENTS.

32:26.578 --> 32:28.680
YOU WANT TO START
WITH MY PARENTS?

32:28.714 --> 32:31.517
YEAH. I'D RATHER
THEY HEARD IT FROM US.

32:45.164 --> 32:48.600
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
OKAY.

32:50.469 --> 32:52.271
HEY.

32:52.304 --> 32:53.605
HEY.

32:58.477 --> 33:00.246
YOU'RE GIVING THIS TO ME?

33:00.279 --> 33:01.613
YEAH.

33:02.681 --> 33:04.283
THANKS.

33:09.388 --> 33:14.160
SO, I SHOULD...
YEAH. I KNOW.
YOU'RE UNAVAILABLE.

33:43.555 --> 33:45.357
SHE KNOWS ABOUT US.

33:45.391 --> 33:48.794
THEY KNOW ABOUT US,
AND SHE'S LOOKING
AT YEARBOOKS.

33:48.827 --> 33:50.796
IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME
BEFORE THEY FIGURE IT OUT,

33:50.829 --> 33:52.298
IF THEY HAVEN'T ALREADY.

33:54.166 --> 33:56.102
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

33:57.836 --> 33:59.338
IT'S TIME TO TALK TO JASON.

34:03.442 --> 34:05.111
( sighs )

34:19.257 --> 34:21.260
HEY.

34:21.293 --> 34:22.793
HEY.

34:22.828 --> 34:24.463
DID DAD CALL?

34:24.496 --> 34:28.199
I DON'T THINK SO,
BUT I JUST GOT HOME.

34:28.234 --> 34:30.601
HOW WAS THE COLLEGE FAIR?

34:30.636 --> 34:33.739
I LEFT EARLY TO TRY ON
THE BRIDESMAID'S DRESS.

34:33.772 --> 34:36.208
OH, YEAH? HOW WAS IT?

34:36.242 --> 34:38.177
NOT A GREAT FIT.

34:39.811 --> 34:42.714
( telephone rings )

34:43.915 --> 34:45.751
( ring )

34:45.784 --> 34:47.152
HELLO?

34:47.186 --> 34:48.820
HEY, TOM.

34:53.525 --> 34:55.893
( mouths silently )

34:55.927 --> 34:57.496
OH?

34:57.529 --> 34:59.131
NO...

34:59.165 --> 35:02.468
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

35:02.501 --> 35:04.270
I'M GLAD IT WENT WELL.

35:04.303 --> 35:08.140
I'M SURE SHE WOULD
LOVE TO TALK TO HER.

35:08.174 --> 35:09.775
KATE'S COMING TO THE PHONE.

35:18.450 --> 35:19.651
Kate: HANNA?

35:21.320 --> 35:23.422
HEY.

35:23.455 --> 35:26.158
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR NOT SAYING ANYTHING.

35:26.192 --> 35:27.559
I AM SO SORRY...

35:27.593 --> 35:29.428
DON'T APOLOGIZE.

35:29.461 --> 35:31.230
WE'RE PRACTICALLY
FAMILY NOW.

35:31.263 --> 35:32.898
I-I JUST...
 ACTUALLY...

35:32.931 --> 35:35.167
I'M SORRY ABOUT WHAT
HAPPENED TO YOUR HORSE.

35:35.201 --> 35:37.569
OH.
YEAH, THAT'S OKAY.

35:37.603 --> 35:40.639
YOU KNOW, TRAINING
 A HORSE IS AN ART.

35:40.672 --> 35:43.242
YOU HAVE TO WORK
 WITH THE ANIMAL,

35:43.275 --> 35:45.911
BENDING ITS WILL
UNTIL IT KNOWS
YOU'RE ITS MASTER,

35:45.944 --> 35:47.513
TAKING ALL THE FIGHT
OUT OF IT

35:47.546 --> 35:49.348
UNTIL IT
TRULY IS BROKEN.

35:49.381 --> 35:51.517
UM...

35:51.550 --> 35:54.786
THAT'S HOW YOU'RE
GOING TO FEEL WHEN
I'M THROUGH WITH YOU.

35:54.820 --> 35:56.355
WELCOME TO THE FAMILY...

35:56.388 --> 35:57.689
SIS.

36:25.984 --> 36:28.220
HEY.

36:28.254 --> 36:30.289
HEY.

36:30.322 --> 36:31.590
WHAT'S THAT?

36:33.325 --> 36:35.727
IT'S A BOX OF ALI'S THINGS.

36:35.761 --> 36:38.830
JASON FOUND IT.
HE GAVE IT TO ME.

36:38.864 --> 36:40.799
WHAT'S IN IT?

36:40.832 --> 36:44.703
OH, AS IT TURNS OUT,
IT'S JUST...

36:44.736 --> 36:46.305
A WHOLE BUNCH OF NOTHING.

36:46.338 --> 36:48.574
( objects clatter )

36:48.607 --> 36:50.376
WHAT'S UP?

36:50.409 --> 36:54.713
OH, I TALKED TO
DR. SULLIVAN TODAY,
ABOUT MIKE,

36:54.746 --> 36:56.848
AND I MADE AN APPOINTMENT
FOR HIM TO SEE

36:56.882 --> 36:58.584
SOMEBODY SHE SUGGESTED.

36:58.617 --> 37:00.586
OH. GOOD.

37:00.619 --> 37:03.522
YOU LIKED GOING
TO SEE SOMEONE, RIGHT?
YEAH.

37:03.555 --> 37:06.525
OBVIOUSLY, I WASN'T
VERY THRILLED ABOUT
GOING IN THE FIRST PLACE,

37:06.558 --> 37:09.895
BUT... YEAH, I ACTUALLY
STARTED TO LOOK FORWARD TO IT.

37:09.928 --> 37:13.265
CAN YOU TELL MIKE THAT?
'CAUSE HE DOES NOT WANT TO GO.

37:13.299 --> 37:15.000
SURE.

37:15.033 --> 37:17.336
I'LL TALK TO HIM.

37:17.369 --> 37:19.338
I DON'T REALLY KNOW IF
HE'LL LISTEN TO ME.

37:19.371 --> 37:20.739
WELL, DON'T LET THAT
STOP YOU.

37:20.772 --> 37:22.374
I NEVER DO.

37:22.408 --> 37:24.643
AND COULD YOU MAYBE
POSSIBLY TELL HIM

37:24.676 --> 37:27.446
HOW SEEING A THERAPIST
DOESN'T MAKE HIM
A TOTAL LOSER?

37:27.479 --> 37:29.047
MOM. I'M ON IT.

37:29.080 --> 37:30.649
OKAY.

37:30.682 --> 37:32.818
I JUST... I THINK
HE NEED THIS.

37:33.952 --> 37:35.421
Yeah.

37:38.424 --> 37:42.060
ACTUALLY, THERE WAS,
UM, ONE OTHER THING.

37:42.093 --> 37:45.030
I FEEL KIND OF STRANGE
EVEN BRINGING IT UP,

37:45.063 --> 37:47.733
BUT, UM...

37:47.766 --> 37:53.639
EARLIER THIS YEAR,
THERE WERE SOME RUMORS
ABOUT MR. FITZ

37:53.672 --> 37:57.509
BEING INVOLVED
WITH A STUDENT.

37:57.543 --> 37:58.910
YEAH.

37:58.944 --> 38:01.347
AND I JUST ASSUMED
IT WAS GOSSIP

38:01.380 --> 38:03.315
BECAUSE HE WAS YOUNG,

38:03.349 --> 38:05.317
AND CLEARLY
A LOT OF STUDENTS

38:05.351 --> 38:07.453
WERE NURSING
A CRUSH ON HIM.

38:07.486 --> 38:09.788
BUT MAYBE
I SHOULDN'T HAVE.

38:09.821 --> 38:12.624
SHOULDN'T HAVE WHAT?

38:12.658 --> 38:14.693
ASSUMED IT WASN'T TRUE.

38:18.497 --> 38:22.368
IS THERE SOMETHING
YOU WANT TO TELL ME
ABOUT MR. FITZ...

38:26.705 --> 38:27.839
...AND SPENCER?

38:27.873 --> 38:28.907
WHAT?

38:28.940 --> 38:31.777
ARE MR. FITZ AND SPENCER...

38:31.810 --> 38:33.379
INVOLVED?

38:33.412 --> 38:36.782
WHAT? NO!
WHY WOULD YOU
EVEN THINK THAT?

38:36.815 --> 38:39.050
BECAUSE I SAW THEM
TALKING IN HIS CAR,

38:39.084 --> 38:41.687
AND IT SEEMED... INTIMATE.

38:41.720 --> 38:44.356
WELL, THEY'RE NOT...
INTIMATE.

38:46.091 --> 38:50.796
BUT WOULD IT BE SO BAD
IF THEY WERE, THOUGH?

38:50.829 --> 38:53.799
YOU SAID SO YOURSELF--
THERE'S BARELY ANY
AGE DIFFERENCE.

38:53.832 --> 38:55.801
YEAH, BUT, I MEAN,
THAT 'S NOT THE POINT.

38:55.834 --> 38:58.404
HE WAS HER TEACHER,
AND IF I FOUND OUT

38:58.437 --> 39:00.972
HE ABUSED HIS POWER
LIKE THAT, I'D BE...

39:01.006 --> 39:03.008
REALLY DISAPPOINTED.

39:04.710 --> 39:06.011
YEAH.

39:08.747 --> 39:10.749
WELL...

39:10.782 --> 39:14.586
THERE'S-- THERE'S
NOTHING GOING ON
BETWEEN THEM, SO...

39:14.620 --> 39:15.887
GOOD.

39:21.760 --> 39:24.062
YOU KNOW,
I TAKE THAT BACK.

39:25.464 --> 39:27.933
I'D FEEL MORE THAN
DISAPPOINTED.

39:27.966 --> 39:30.135
I'D FEEL BETRAYED.

39:38.176 --> 39:40.111
( objects clatter )

39:43.649 --> 39:46.051
( door opens )

39:47.653 --> 39:49.187
HERE.

39:49.220 --> 39:51.590
SMALL SIPS.

39:53.224 --> 39:55.060
YOU KNOW WHAT
THE WORST PART IS?

39:55.093 --> 39:58.196
IF I HAD JUST LOOKED UP
DURING THAT MASSAGE,

39:58.229 --> 40:00.131
WE'D KNOW WHO "A" IS.

40:00.165 --> 40:02.734
WHAT DID
THE HANDS FEEL LIKE,
A GUY OR A GIRL?

40:02.768 --> 40:05.471
I-I THOUGHT
LIKE A GIRL, BUT...

40:05.504 --> 40:06.905
NOW I DON'T KNOW.

40:08.239 --> 40:09.541
DO YOU NEED TO TAKE
ANOTHER SHOWER?

40:09.575 --> 40:11.209
NO, I THINK FIVE IS ENOUGH.

40:11.242 --> 40:13.078
( sighs )
I COULD USE ONE.

40:13.111 --> 40:14.880
I'VE FELT GROSS
EVER SINCE I DISCOVERED

40:14.913 --> 40:17.015
IAN'S VIDEO'S MIGHT
HAVE HAD MORE THAN
ONE CAMERAMAN!

40:17.048 --> 40:19.117
THAT IS SO CREEPY.

40:19.150 --> 40:21.019
WHAT'S EVEN CREEPIER
IS THAT ONE OF THOSE
GUYS HAS A GUN,

40:21.052 --> 40:22.588
AND A BADGE.

40:22.621 --> 40:24.990
AND A RELATIONSHIP
TO JENNA, WHO HATES US,

40:25.023 --> 40:26.825
AND HATED ALI EVEN MORE.

40:26.858 --> 40:28.827
SO, WHICH ONE IS "A"?

40:28.860 --> 40:30.729
THAT 'S THE THING--
EVER SINCE WE REALIZED

40:30.762 --> 40:32.731
"A" MADE IAN'S DEATH
LOOK LIKE A SUICIDE,

40:32.764 --> 40:36.668
WE'VE BEEN THINKING
THAT "A" AND THE KILLER
ARE THE SAME PERSON.

40:36.702 --> 40:38.937
WHAT IF "A"
IS A GROUP OF PEOPLE,

40:38.970 --> 40:41.473
ALL PLAYING TOGETHER
FOR THE SAME TEAM?

40:41.507 --> 40:43.509
OR THE SAME CLUB.

40:45.176 --> 40:46.812
( doorbell rings )

40:46.845 --> 40:48.880
Spencer:
THAT'S PROBABLY ARIA,

40:48.914 --> 40:52.851
AND MY GUESS IS SHE
HAS SOMETHING THAT SHE
WANTS TO SAY TO ME.

40:54.686 --> 40:57.455
IF I'M NOT
BACK IN FIVE MINUTES,
SEND A RESCUE TEAM.

41:00.058 --> 41:03.094
( cellphone vibrates )

41:03.128 --> 41:05.997
( vibrates )

41:07.132 --> 41:09.568
( vibrates )

41:12.571 --> 41:14.706
IT'S NOTHING.

41:18.977 --> 41:21.079
HEY. HOW IS SHE?

41:21.112 --> 41:24.650
SHE'S... SHAKEN,
BUT SHE'S STILL STANDING.

41:26.184 --> 41:29.120
( overlapping )

41:29.154 --> 41:31.890
WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO?
I'M NOT MAD AT YOU.

41:31.923 --> 41:33.759
REALLY?

41:33.792 --> 41:35.827
YEAH.

41:35.861 --> 41:38.564
GOOD, 'CAUSE I JUST DID IT
BECAUSE I WAS NERVOUS,

41:38.597 --> 41:40.231
AND YOU'RE--
YOU'RE REALLY TINY,

41:40.265 --> 41:42.601
AND I LOVE YOU.

41:42.634 --> 41:43.935
I LOVE YOU TOO.

41:46.872 --> 41:49.575
AND BESIDES,
YOU GOING TO FITZ,

41:49.608 --> 41:51.977
IT ACTUALLY TURNED OUT
TO BE A GOOD THING.

41:52.010 --> 41:54.546
MADE HIM STEP UP.
REALLY?

41:54.580 --> 41:58.016
I'M SO GLAD TO HEAR THAT.
DON'T BE TOO HAPPY.

41:58.049 --> 42:01.019
MY MOM THINKS THAT
YOU'RE THE ONE THAT'S
HOOKING UP WITH HIM.

42:01.052 --> 42:02.520
WAIT, WHAT?

42:04.189 --> 42:08.860
( crickets chirping )

42:24.676 --> 42:28.046
I WAS WONDERING
HOW LONG IT'D BE
BEFORE YOU SHOWED.

42:28.079 --> 42:31.082
IN ROSEWOOD, ALL ROADS
SEEM TO LEAD BACK
TO THIS HOUSE.

42:38.056 --> 42:40.258
SORRY. I FORGOT.

42:45.030 --> 42:47.666
SO WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND?

42:49.400 --> 42:51.737
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
WE'RE STILL COOL, JASON.

42:53.939 --> 42:56.842
WHAT DOES IT MATTER
ANYMORE? IT'S OVER,
RIGHT?

42:56.875 --> 43:00.612
I'M A COP NOW.
MATTERS MORE THAN EVER.

43:03.281 --> 43:05.751
( distant siren wails )

43:16.662 --> 43:19.297
SORRY TO KEEP YOU WAITING.

43:19.330 --> 43:21.266
I WAS TRYING TO REACH
ANOTHER PATIENT.

43:23.802 --> 43:25.704
GOT A LITTLE COLD IN HERE.

43:27.338 --> 43:28.840
ALL RIGHT.

43:34.079 --> 43:35.380
SO.

43:36.948 --> 43:39.017
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE
TO TALK ABOUT?
