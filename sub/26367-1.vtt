00:13.588 --> 00:17.130
(somber orchestral music)

01:47.255 --> 01:50.380
(boat engine roars)

02:04.339 --> 02:07.797
(distant boat approaches)

02:07.880 --> 02:11.421
(somber orchestral music)

03:27.339 --> 03:29.838
- There's only
four bags in here.

03:29.922 --> 03:32.588
- That's all you get now,
man, rates are goin' up.

03:35.005 --> 03:36.505
- Does Gayle know about this?

03:36.588 --> 03:38.005
She's not gonna be too happy.

03:38.089 --> 03:40.755
- Oh, hell, Gayle should be
worried about keepin' us happy.

03:42.755 --> 03:45.130
- What the hell, Clint? We got
a good thing goin' here, man.

03:45.214 --> 03:47.005
- The economy's rotten.

03:47.089 --> 03:48.172
Look, you don't
like their rates,

03:48.255 --> 03:49.339
they'll take their
product someplace else.

03:49.421 --> 03:52.130
- What are you, a stock analyst?

03:52.214 --> 03:54.922
I don't wanna be out here
doin' this more than you do,

03:55.005 --> 03:57.297
but you know this is gonna
cause nothin' but problems.

03:59.755 --> 04:00.797
- This is our decision.

04:04.172 --> 04:05.047
- Alright.

04:07.713 --> 04:09.630
Good luck sellin'
directly to the buyers.

04:09.713 --> 04:12.297
Gayle's got half of
Day County locked up.

04:12.380 --> 04:14.630
- We'll see about that.

04:23.463 --> 04:26.755
(dark orchestral music)

06:35.255 --> 06:38.297
(background chatter)

06:51.546 --> 06:53.380
- [Waitress] Be right
back with those drinks.

06:53.463 --> 06:55.922
- Appreciate that, thank you.
- Thank you.

07:06.380 --> 07:07.880
- Aw, thank you kindly, Marie.

07:07.963 --> 07:10.297
- No problem, I'll be
back to take your orders.

07:10.380 --> 07:11.255
- Alright.

07:13.297 --> 07:15.588
I've been tryin' to
call you for three days.

07:21.047 --> 07:21.089
Julie.

07:24.713 --> 07:25.588
- What?

07:26.713 --> 07:28.047
- Here we go again.

07:28.130 --> 07:30.671
It looks like I'm gonna
do all the damn talkin'?

07:31.630 --> 07:34.255
How many times I gotta tell ya?

07:34.339 --> 07:36.880
It's time for you to
move on and forget it.

07:36.963 --> 07:39.671
- I really don't wanna be
having this conversation.

07:39.755 --> 07:40.922
- [Man] You're the one
who invited me here

07:41.005 --> 07:42.546
in the first place.

07:45.047 --> 07:46.963
- I moved all my stuff
outta your place.

07:53.546 --> 07:56.089
- Yeah. (chuckles)

07:56.172 --> 07:58.130
- I'm sorry, I just,
I can't be with you.

07:58.214 --> 08:00.255
Not when I'm still in
love with my husband.

08:00.339 --> 08:01.172
- Ex-husband.

08:04.380 --> 08:05.172
- I don't care.

08:08.047 --> 08:10.297
- What are you gonna do when
he doesn't take you back?

08:12.671 --> 08:16.838
- I'll be alone.
(somber orchestral music)

08:32.380 --> 08:34.797
(audience applauds)

08:34.880 --> 08:38.671
- A goal without a
plan is just a dream.

08:38.755 --> 08:40.962
What I've developed
is a guaranteed way

08:41.047 --> 08:42.546
for you to achieve your goals.

08:43.671 --> 08:46.755
So, if you join me, my
program helps you focus on

08:46.838 --> 08:50.505
the behavioral changes that
lead to real weight loss.

08:50.588 --> 08:53.005
For instance, what
force pushes us

08:53.089 --> 08:54.588
to eat when we know better?

08:56.255 --> 08:57.630
What about you?

08:57.713 --> 08:59.671
Have you noticed a
connection between eating

08:59.755 --> 09:00.963
and your emotions?

09:02.047 --> 09:05.505
- I tend to eat more
when I'm depressed.

09:05.588 --> 09:07.963
- Yes, yes, exactly.

09:08.047 --> 09:10.339
When we feel down, we
seek out comfort food.

09:10.421 --> 09:12.546
We bury ourselves in
food like ice cream

09:12.630 --> 09:14.172
and chocolate and cake.

09:14.255 --> 09:17.588
Even though they have
zero nutritional value.

09:17.671 --> 09:20.922
They seemingly offset
those negative feelings.

09:22.255 --> 09:24.630
But what makes us feel
negative in the first place?

09:24.713 --> 09:26.463
What do you think?

09:31.588 --> 09:33.630
- If I knew, I wouldn't be here.

09:33.713 --> 09:36.339
- It's okay, you're right,
that's why we're here.

09:36.421 --> 09:38.963
You don't have to be perfect,
because there is no such thing

09:39.047 --> 09:40.713
as a perfect person.

09:40.797 --> 09:43.546
So, no matter where
we are right now,

09:43.630 --> 09:45.755
we can get better and we will.

09:45.838 --> 09:47.214
(audience applauds)

09:47.297 --> 09:50.005
(laughs)

09:50.089 --> 09:51.671
So, if you're serious this time,

09:51.755 --> 09:53.130
if you really wanna lose weight,

09:54.380 --> 09:56.172
I can show you how to
achieve your goals.

09:57.713 --> 10:00.880
My patented and proven
to work weight-loss pill.

10:01.630 --> 10:02.505
Supressall.

10:03.089 --> 10:06.713
(audience applauds)

10:12.005 --> 10:12.130
- Thank you.

10:18.380 --> 10:20.047
- Julie.

10:20.130 --> 10:20.963
Hey.

10:22.963 --> 10:24.463
- I'm not here for you, so...

10:30.255 --> 10:33.005
- I haven't seen you in a while.

10:34.214 --> 10:35.130
- It's a small town, Thad.

10:38.172 --> 10:39.963
You can see me
whenever you want.

10:42.172 --> 10:43.380
- [Friend] We'll
take two bottles.

11:04.047 --> 11:06.838
- Not a bad haul for a weekday.

11:06.922 --> 11:09.172
- Not a bad haul for
any day of the week.

11:11.838 --> 11:13.755
So, we need to talk about
the supplier's rates.

11:13.838 --> 11:16.339
- We do, but first
let's take a ride.

11:17.380 --> 11:20.671
(dark orchestral music)

12:18.463 --> 12:22.588
Grab a shovel.
(dark orchestral music)

14:21.214 --> 14:23.255
- I don't like
diggin' graves, Gayle.

14:26.380 --> 14:28.421
- They shorted us on
our last shipment.

14:30.047 --> 14:31.421
I did what had to be done.

14:37.214 --> 14:38.880
- Next time, leave me out of it.

14:45.255 --> 14:47.630
- Take care of this for me.

14:59.963 --> 15:03.421
(somber orchestral music)

15:10.089 --> 15:12.255
- [Julie] Shit.

15:50.797 --> 15:52.463
- Come on.

17:08.546 --> 17:11.297
(water splashes)

17:18.130 --> 17:20.630
(somber orchestral music)

17:20.713 --> 17:22.797
- [Thad] I don't wanna be out
here doin' this more than you.

17:22.880 --> 17:23.922
- This is our decision.

17:30.755 --> 17:35.671
- [Thad] You know this is gonna
cause nothin' but problems.

18:10.380 --> 18:11.255
- Thad.

18:15.713 --> 18:18.963
(wind whistles)

18:19.047 --> 18:21.255
(background chatter)

18:21.339 --> 18:23.922
I keep a pack of
menthols at home.

18:27.130 --> 18:28.463
Every once in a
while, I'll smoke one,

18:28.546 --> 18:29.963
and it reminds me of you.

18:40.297 --> 18:42.838
- So, why you been comin'
to the weight-loss clinic?

18:44.255 --> 18:44.713
- I need to lose weight?

18:47.339 --> 18:48.838
- Would you stop it?

18:48.922 --> 18:50.214
It was never about that.

19:00.963 --> 19:01.005
Thank you.

19:08.797 --> 19:09.546
- I never really
thought about myself

19:09.630 --> 19:11.963
before you started
working there.

19:16.463 --> 19:18.339
It made me feel like
there was something wrong

19:18.421 --> 19:19.546
with the way I look.

19:26.671 --> 19:28.963
Maybe I can count calories
and get my body back.

19:30.463 --> 19:31.755
Maybe I can take a pill
and get my life back.

19:38.880 --> 19:40.130
- Time has only shown us,

19:40.214 --> 19:42.172
that I'm not good
enough for you, Julie.

19:43.546 --> 19:45.130
- You're better than you think.

19:45.214 --> 19:49.797
- No, I'm not.

19:49.880 --> 19:52.671
I've done things that I'm
havin' a hard time livin' with.

19:54.463 --> 19:57.671
I don't even know
who I am anymore.

19:57.755 --> 20:00.505
(somber orchestral music)

20:00.588 --> 20:03.005
Hell, I don't even know how
to get back to who I was.

20:10.005 --> 20:11.588
Look, I just think it would
be easier on both of us,

20:11.671 --> 20:15.838
if you just stayed
away from the clinic.

20:18.214 --> 20:19.172
Bye, Julie.

20:28.838 --> 20:31.339
(Julie sighs)

20:36.755 --> 20:39.047
(dog barks)

20:39.880 --> 20:42.671
- [Woman] Need
anything in there?

20:42.755 --> 20:44.255
- Nothin' we need.

20:45.922 --> 20:48.172
(dog barks)

20:49.671 --> 20:52.255
- Looks like Buster
got somethin'.

21:04.339 --> 21:05.214
Hey, hon?

21:07.130 --> 21:10.047
(porcelain smashes)

21:11.755 --> 21:13.671
- Dog, Buster, he tends to bring

21:13.755 --> 21:17.505
birds and squirrels up
to the house. (chuckles)

21:17.588 --> 21:20.797
Dead critters in his
mouth. (chuckles)

21:20.880 --> 21:22.130
Although, you can't blame him.

21:22.214 --> 21:24.297
He thinks he's
bringin' you a gift.

21:27.963 --> 21:30.755
This is the gift he
brought this morning.

21:35.546 --> 21:36.755
A human ear.

21:41.588 --> 21:44.755
- You think he'd be able to
take us where he found it?

21:44.838 --> 21:47.671
- (chuckles) You just
try and keep up with him.

21:48.505 --> 21:52.588
(suspenseful orchestral music)

22:01.421 --> 22:04.880
(Buster sniffs)

22:21.755 --> 22:23.797
- Definitely not
a proper burial.

22:35.630 --> 22:37.172
- Mornin', Sheriff.

22:37.255 --> 22:38.588
- How's my favorite intern?

22:39.380 --> 22:41.380
Coffee?
- I already had some.

22:42.130 --> 22:44.047
- What's the news from the lab?

22:45.089 --> 22:46.797
- No fingerprints found on file.

22:49.671 --> 22:52.172
Nobody's came forward
to identify the bodies.

22:52.255 --> 22:54.838
- The hell else is new?
(intern chuckles)

22:57.255 --> 22:58.755
- I found this in his pocket.

23:02.880 --> 23:06.255
(moody orchestral music)

23:08.255 --> 23:10.047
- Any idea what it means?
- Could be a transaction?

23:12.130 --> 23:12.172
- Could be.

23:15.130 --> 23:20.922
But I got a hunch I'm gonna
check out this afternoon.

23:22.089 --> 23:48.047
Good work.

23:48.047 --> 23:50.755
(device bleeps)

24:21.255 --> 24:22.922
Sorry to bother you, ma'am.

24:23.005 --> 24:25.463
Seen anyone specific
in these waters like

24:25.546 --> 24:26.922
in that area there?
- Well, yeah.

24:27.005 --> 24:29.130
That's Thad Sitter's
fishin' spot.

24:32.922 --> 24:33.797
- Fishin'.

25:00.463 --> 25:02.797
Just another busy
day at the office.

25:02.880 --> 25:04.214
- Sheriff.
- (chuckles) Thad.

25:06.005 --> 25:08.797
Don't you rent out
Stockton Lake now?

25:09.630 --> 25:10.505
- I do.

25:12.047 --> 25:14.421
- Seen anything suspicious
out there on the water?

25:16.047 --> 25:19.505
- Suspicious how?

25:19.588 --> 25:21.297
- How often do you
go fishin', Thad?

25:23.214 --> 25:25.963
- Three or four times a week.
- Must be nice.

25:27.255 --> 25:30.463
Would you mind recommendin' a
fishin' spot for me sometime?

25:30.546 --> 25:31.005
- Sure, Sheriff.

25:32.922 --> 25:34.339
What's this all about?

25:34.421 --> 25:36.588
- Picked up two bodies
out on Highway K.

25:37.630 --> 25:38.047
Paul Walter's farm?

25:44.214 --> 25:45.922
- Do I know 'em?

25:46.005 --> 25:47.755
- I don't even
know who they are.

25:49.380 --> 25:53.339
Played me a hunch,
GPS coordinates led me

25:53.421 --> 25:55.463
smack in the middle
of Stockton Lake.

25:56.463 --> 25:57.671
The area of water in
question happens to be

25:57.755 --> 26:00.421
your top-secret fishin' spot.

26:02.838 --> 26:05.214
- Well, I guess it's not
so top-secret after all.

26:05.297 --> 26:07.546
- [Sheriff] I figure maybe
you'd seen somethin', seein' as

26:07.630 --> 26:08.255
how it's quiet on that end.

26:10.546 --> 26:12.130
- It is quiet, that's why
I moved out there, but,

26:14.047 --> 26:15.130
I haven't seen anything
out of the ordinary.

26:16.922 --> 26:19.130
- It's not often this county has

26:19.214 --> 26:21.214
a double-homicide on its
hands, so when it does,

26:23.130 --> 26:25.214
it's my job to make
sure I catch the killer.

26:27.297 --> 26:30.172
Hope you understand how
committed I am to that.

26:30.255 --> 26:31.880
- I don't know how committed
you are to anything.

26:31.963 --> 26:34.421
- More committed than you've
proven yourself to be.

26:43.130 --> 26:45.922
- Sorry to hear Julie
broke your heart.

26:50.713 --> 26:51.755
Afternoon, Sheriff.

26:58.005 --> 26:58.297
- You're leaving town.

27:00.630 --> 27:01.713
- It's fine, he
doesn't have anything.

27:01.797 --> 27:03.880
I'm not even a suspect.

27:05.380 --> 27:07.922
- He'll make you one, even
if he doesn't know it yet.

27:08.005 --> 27:10.713
- Gayle, you're just
actin' paranoid.

27:10.797 --> 27:11.797
- Your ex-wife just
broke up with him.

27:11.880 --> 27:14.713
- Hey, I didn't cause that.

27:14.797 --> 27:17.089
- I'm not gonna let your little
love triangle bring me down.

27:17.172 --> 27:20.214
- Hey, listen, you
killed those men, not me.

27:20.297 --> 27:22.588
- And you buried the bodies.

27:24.838 --> 27:26.588
Inside the bag is
a key and a map.

27:26.671 --> 27:28.797
It'll take you to
a family cabin.

27:28.880 --> 27:29.172
You have to leave now.

27:40.505 --> 27:41.339
- You know, I
didn't ask for this.

27:43.339 --> 27:45.588
- You wanted to make
money, just like me.

27:45.671 --> 27:46.880
This is the price.

27:48.297 --> 27:51.755
(moody orchestral music)

29:10.172 --> 29:11.380
(knocks)

29:17.797 --> 29:20.130
- What do you want?

29:20.838 --> 29:21.755
- Let me in.

29:23.505 --> 29:25.047
- Well, alright then.

29:25.130 --> 29:27.505
(cat meows)

29:27.588 --> 29:28.797
Oh, I know, Mattie, I know.

29:28.880 --> 29:29.255
Okay, baby, okay.

29:31.713 --> 29:33.339
Oh.

29:34.505 --> 29:35.339
You look like you're
doin' alright.

29:37.297 --> 29:38.297
I mean, since the
last time I saw ya.

29:40.838 --> 29:42.713
How's it, uh, how's it been?

29:43.214 --> 29:45.546
- I don't know.

29:45.630 --> 29:46.713
You look like you're doing well.

29:46.797 --> 29:49.713
I'm sure this trailer home
is a real chick magnet.

29:51.546 --> 29:52.880
- What the hell are
you doin' here, Gayle?

29:52.963 --> 29:55.880
- Well, I've got a job for you.

29:57.172 --> 29:59.588
- You know, I'm not
sure I'm interested.

29:59.671 --> 30:00.588
Why do you need me?

30:02.047 --> 30:03.505
I hear you're pretty good at
cleanin' up your own problems.

30:06.005 --> 30:08.339
- The sheriff's
watching me too close.

30:08.421 --> 30:10.380
I don't need any more
suspicion my way.

30:11.339 --> 30:12.880
- Who's the target?

30:12.963 --> 30:14.047
- Thad.
(dark orchestral music)

30:14.130 --> 30:17.047
Think he's good, but he
doesn't have what it takes.

30:18.880 --> 30:20.713
- Oh, I like that.

30:20.797 --> 30:22.130
Survival of the fittest.

30:23.255 --> 30:25.838
What's he got, like a
heart of gold or somethin'?

30:26.671 --> 30:30.214
Down, Mattie, down, baby.
(cat meows)

30:31.130 --> 30:33.130
- Yeah, that's
exactly his problem.

30:35.172 --> 30:35.546
- Where can I find him?

30:37.255 --> 30:40.214
- In the perfect
place to take him out.

30:44.172 --> 30:47.880
(door opens and closes)

30:47.963 --> 30:50.130
When I first started,
I was stuck in a cycle

30:50.214 --> 30:51.797
of fluctuating weight.

30:51.880 --> 30:55.297
So, I resolved to get fit
and lose weight for good.

30:55.380 --> 30:59.546
I had to create ready-to-go
positive thoughts.

31:01.214 --> 31:02.963
You have to be ready
to encounter the
candy dish at work,

31:03.047 --> 31:05.463
or the fried items on the menu.

31:06.671 --> 31:08.297
So, I wanna hear what
you'll tell yourself

31:08.380 --> 31:11.546
when you find yourself
in a tempting situation.

31:11.630 --> 31:14.630
(background chatter)

31:17.380 --> 31:17.546
- Have you seen Thad?

31:19.922 --> 31:22.047
- He's on vacation.

31:22.130 --> 31:22.380
- That's all he said?

31:24.380 --> 31:26.588
- It's really none
of my business.

31:35.339 --> 31:39.255
("Toccata and Fugue in D minor"
by Johann Sebastian Bach)

31:39.339 --> 31:41.463
- What're you doing?

31:41.546 --> 31:42.421
Why are you watching me?

31:44.588 --> 31:48.755
Don't you know that your
lives are in danger?

31:49.588 --> 31:52.671
When you've tried,
but not survived,

31:52.755 --> 31:54.588
we're watching an entire hour

31:54.671 --> 31:58.546
of the New Uncle Gregory
Horror Hour has made mice...

32:04.172 --> 32:06.797
- [Man] Well, a happy
birthday to you, too.

32:06.880 --> 32:09.630
And these candles
are not working!

32:11.630 --> 32:15.588
(suspenseful suspenseful music)

32:38.463 --> 32:41.463
(background chatter)

32:50.297 --> 32:53.421
(door bell jingles)

32:57.963 --> 32:58.838
- Hi.

33:00.838 --> 33:01.630
- Hi.

33:05.089 --> 33:05.671
Nice to see ya again, Julie.

33:09.797 --> 33:10.505
- Do you have a moment to talk?

33:12.505 --> 33:13.421
- Of course.

33:15.380 --> 33:16.838
What brings you here?

33:16.922 --> 33:17.755
- I think I need to file
a missing persons report?

33:17.838 --> 33:20.339
- Really?

33:20.421 --> 33:21.297
On who?

33:23.880 --> 33:25.505
- Thad.

33:29.797 --> 33:33.297
(sheriff chuckles)

33:33.380 --> 33:34.963
- What makes you suspect that?

33:36.380 --> 33:38.172
- His boss said he
was on vacation,

33:38.255 --> 33:39.630
and then I saw his mom
at the grocery store,

33:39.713 --> 33:41.214
and she didn't know
anything about it, and--

33:41.297 --> 33:43.214
- Maybe he doesn't want
you to know where he went.

33:43.297 --> 33:46.505
(somber orchestral music)

33:46.588 --> 33:47.963
You're divorced, after all.

33:51.047 --> 33:51.588
- [Julie] Sorry.

34:38.420 --> 34:41.130
(chatter on TV)

34:57.713 --> 35:02.630
(suspenseful orchestral music)
(lock rattles)

35:07.089 --> 35:10.546
(lock clicks)

35:50.838 --> 35:53.546
(chatter on TV)

36:04.130 --> 36:05.339
- [Hit Man] Let's go.

36:05.421 --> 36:09.214
(dramatic orchestral music)

36:32.671 --> 36:35.047
- How much is Gayle paying you?

36:35.130 --> 36:36.005
- Enough.

36:43.172 --> 36:45.089
- The next time, you
should ask for more money.

36:46.588 --> 36:48.880
Get you a little
better rug there.

36:50.963 --> 36:51.797
That one looks ridiculous.

36:54.588 --> 36:57.339
- I might be hiding
under this rug,

36:58.130 --> 36:59.214
but at least I'll
still be alive.

36:59.297 --> 37:03.671
(gun fires)
(groans)

37:03.755 --> 37:06.880
(suspenseful orchestral music)

37:34.005 --> 37:35.130
(thud)

37:35.214 --> 37:37.421
(groans)

37:45.255 --> 37:46.089
It wasn't personal.

37:47.463 --> 37:48.838
I only tried to kill
ya because she paid me.

38:57.297 --> 39:00.963
(Thad grunts)

39:01.047 --> 39:04.421
(tense orchestral music)

40:11.922 --> 40:14.630
(keypad bleeps)

41:20.630 --> 41:23.339
(chatter on TV)

41:23.755 --> 41:27.214
(man laughs)

41:27.297 --> 41:29.671
(door opens)

41:30.463 --> 41:32.214
(door closes)

41:32.297 --> 41:35.255
(service bell dings)

42:02.713 --> 42:05.339
(wind whistles)

42:24.297 --> 42:28.172
(suspenseful orchestral music)

43:00.922 --> 43:03.297
- Obstacles don't
have to stop you.

43:03.380 --> 43:07.713
Figure out how to climb it,
go through it, work around it.

43:07.797 --> 43:08.421
Climb it, go through
it, work around--

43:08.505 --> 43:11.421
(knocks)

43:16.880 --> 43:20.005
- [Sheriff] May I come in?

43:27.089 --> 43:28.546
- I hope that's alright.

43:28.630 --> 43:30.380
- Thank you, Julie.

43:30.463 --> 43:33.963
It looks wonderful, but
for official purposes,

43:34.047 --> 43:36.380
I just need to ask you a few
questions regardin' Than,

43:36.463 --> 43:38.130
and then I'll leave.
- Like what?

43:38.214 --> 43:41.546
- I just need to fill
out this paperwork,

43:41.630 --> 43:42.963
and file it for the county.

43:43.963 --> 43:46.588
- Paperwork?
- A few boxes and check marks.

43:46.671 --> 43:47.630
That's all.

43:48.546 --> 43:49.880
- You don't wanna find him?

43:50.546 --> 43:51.380
- I can't begin to search,

43:51.463 --> 43:54.339
until the proper
paperwork is filed.

43:55.838 --> 43:57.255
Lots of red tape, you
know how these things are.

43:59.214 --> 44:00.963
- But this is Thad,
we have to begin now.

44:01.047 --> 44:04.005
- The thing is, it's not
illegal to go missing.

44:05.421 --> 44:06.339
People do it all the time.

44:08.546 --> 44:10.130
For all sorts of reasons.

44:12.005 --> 44:13.505
- You have to have something.

44:16.671 --> 44:18.797
But you have nothing?

44:21.214 --> 44:23.089
(sobs)

44:23.172 --> 44:25.255
This is all my fault
because you hate me.

44:31.005 --> 44:34.797
- [Sheriff] I don't hate ya.

44:34.880 --> 44:37.214
- Please, you have to find him.

44:44.880 --> 44:47.421
- I don't hate you at all.

44:49.297 --> 44:50.713
I still love you.

44:50.797 --> 44:53.047
- If you still love me,
then you would find Thad.

44:55.047 --> 44:57.463
(moody orchestral music)

44:57.546 --> 44:58.172
- Doesn't work like that, baby.

45:43.255 --> 45:45.755
(Thad groans)

45:47.630 --> 45:50.380
- You've gotta
stay down and rest.

45:54.880 --> 45:56.255
- Who are you?

45:56.339 --> 46:00.630
- You stumbled into my
motel office and collapsed.

46:08.880 --> 46:10.089
- Where's my stuff?

46:18.380 --> 46:20.463
- [Manager] Took out
enough to cover your room.

46:30.255 --> 46:33.172
- What's in it for you?
- Nothin'.

46:34.297 --> 46:36.755
You can stay here until
you're healthy enough.

46:40.380 --> 46:41.505
(somber orchestral music)

46:41.588 --> 46:43.380
- Doesn't look like I've
got much of a choice.

47:12.172 --> 47:14.630
- [Julie] Thank you
for coming with me.

47:14.713 --> 47:15.838
- Of course.

47:24.214 --> 47:27.421
- You say it's been 72 hours.

47:28.963 --> 47:31.339
And the police have no
leads, is that right?

47:31.421 --> 47:34.214
- Yeah, that's what
they keep telling me.

47:34.297 --> 47:36.130
They don't care
about finding him.

47:37.380 --> 47:40.255
Thad's out there somewhere, but
they can't explain anything.

47:41.546 --> 47:43.630
- Julie broke up with the
sheriff last week, so he's

47:43.713 --> 47:46.922
not too keen on finding him,
if you know what I mean.

47:47.005 --> 47:48.005
- You can't exhaust
all your options.

47:48.089 --> 47:50.588
- Can you find my husband?

47:50.671 --> 47:53.089
- You mean, your
ex-husband, right?

47:53.172 --> 47:54.421
- Yes.

47:54.505 --> 47:55.463
Sorry.

47:55.546 --> 47:56.880
- Well, what if he
doesn't wanna be found?

47:56.963 --> 47:58.546
- Why does everybody
keep on saying that?

47:58.630 --> 48:01.963
- I mean, what if he
disappeared for some reason,

48:02.047 --> 48:04.047
and he wants to stay hidden?

48:04.130 --> 48:05.339
- That doesn't sound like Thad.

48:05.421 --> 48:07.380
- No, I've know Thad for
years, he's one of those

48:07.463 --> 48:09.588
mommy types, he could
never leave home.

48:11.838 --> 48:13.172
- Well, you never can
tell what a person will do

48:13.255 --> 48:14.671
when they're pushed
to the limit.

48:14.755 --> 48:17.214
- He's never even left
Missouri, for Christ sake.

48:17.297 --> 48:19.297
- Where does he work?
- At a weight-loss clinic.

48:19.380 --> 48:20.505
- Julie's been
stalking him there.

48:20.588 --> 48:21.588
- I only went there
because I'm fat.

48:23.880 --> 48:25.505
- Okay, look, I'm gonna
need everything, alright?

48:25.588 --> 48:27.172
Pictures, records.

48:27.255 --> 48:29.421
I wanna know what kinda
underwear Thad wears.

48:30.630 --> 48:32.671
- So, you'll take the case?

48:32.755 --> 48:33.838
- I've already started.

48:34.963 --> 48:35.838
- Thank you.

48:38.630 --> 48:38.671
- Now, you.

48:40.797 --> 48:43.797
What do you say you and I go
get a slice of pizza together?

48:43.880 --> 48:47.380
(somber orchestral music)

49:17.214 --> 49:18.089
Hey.

49:19.671 --> 49:20.546
Nice doggie.

49:22.172 --> 49:22.463
How you doin'?

49:31.797 --> 49:32.546
Hey, Julie!

49:35.380 --> 49:39.546
I told you, I wanted
to know everything.

49:39.630 --> 49:42.089
- I told you
everything that I know!

49:42.172 --> 49:45.255
- Except that you and Thad
were having financial troubles.

49:45.339 --> 49:48.838
(somber orchestral music)

49:50.172 --> 49:51.297
Adoption agencies,
fertility clinics.

49:51.380 --> 49:54.922
These things aren't
free, I get it.

49:57.214 --> 49:59.297
- Thad blamed himself

49:59.380 --> 50:01.297
for the fertility
treatments not working.

50:02.546 --> 50:03.089
And every time one of
our friends got pregnant,

50:03.172 --> 50:05.089
it just got worse.

50:06.671 --> 50:08.671
- But you were going to adopt?
- We didn't have the money.

50:10.797 --> 50:11.630
That's why Thad
took a second job.

50:13.797 --> 50:15.214
- At the weight-loss clinic.

50:32.713 --> 50:34.922
- Ever since I was little,
this is what I wanted.

50:35.005 --> 50:36.630
A family.

50:37.880 --> 50:39.505
A husband.

50:40.713 --> 50:42.963
A daughter, a son,
just children, babies.

50:45.588 --> 50:47.963
Just something to pour
my life into, you know?

50:50.214 --> 50:51.005
- Yeah.

51:01.755 --> 51:03.630
- When you gestate
too many calories,

51:03.713 --> 51:05.588
and your failure
brings you down,

51:05.671 --> 51:07.421
another commitment broken,

51:07.505 --> 51:10.339
you feel like the
fattest person in town.

51:10.421 --> 51:12.505
Are you gonna quit,
are you gonna fall?

51:12.588 --> 51:15.005
It's not too late
to heed the call.

51:15.089 --> 51:17.838
The race isn't over,
you can still win.

51:17.922 --> 51:21.089
You're gonna make it,
one day healthy and thin.

51:22.047 --> 51:23.255
The Dieter's Poem.

51:24.089 --> 51:27.713
I wrote that.
(audience applauds)

51:33.089 --> 51:35.797
(wind whistles)

52:06.463 --> 52:10.546
(suspenseful orchestral music)

52:45.755 --> 52:47.130
- [Clerk] Can I help you?

52:47.214 --> 52:49.047
- [Jake] Yeah, what can
you tell me about this wig?

52:52.546 --> 52:53.463
- Oh, wow.

52:54.380 --> 52:56.797
I haven't seen this
model in years.

52:56.880 --> 52:57.713
- Do you sell these?
- No.

52:59.671 --> 53:01.797
This is an imported
European deluxe model.

53:01.880 --> 53:05.380
Made from the finest, most
luxurious donkey hair.

53:06.463 --> 53:09.339
- Donkey hair?
- Ah, truly resplendent.

53:09.421 --> 53:11.880
These animals have
been bred for centuries

53:11.963 --> 53:14.214
to obtain the perfect
quality for the hair.

53:14.297 --> 53:15.172
- Ah!

53:16.630 --> 53:19.005
Where would someone go to find
one of these in this area?

53:19.089 --> 53:20.713
- Now?

53:22.172 --> 53:24.588
You'd have to go to Eastern
Europe to get one, most likely.

53:24.671 --> 53:27.463
But I have sold a few
of these in the past.

53:28.755 --> 53:31.546
Let me look, there's a serial
number on the back of the tag.

53:33.297 --> 53:35.713
Let me see this.

53:35.797 --> 53:37.297
- Careful, that's
a little gooey.

53:39.922 --> 53:40.713
- Ah, yes.

53:41.922 --> 53:43.421
Let me check my files.

53:45.089 --> 53:45.713
- Very good.

54:12.089 --> 54:13.421
Now you can see.

54:22.713 --> 54:24.963
- I found the original
buyer of the wig.

54:25.047 --> 54:27.463
It was sold to a Michael Hurt.

54:29.047 --> 54:30.588
- Thank you very much.

54:31.630 --> 54:34.214
- Now, you know
where to find me,

54:34.297 --> 54:36.130
if you're ever lookin'
for any help on top.

54:51.922 --> 54:52.755
- Sorry for the
intrusion, Gayle.

54:56.671 --> 54:57.963
I figured maybe it's
time we had a talk.

55:01.130 --> 55:01.172
Is he dead?

55:04.047 --> 55:07.463
- You don't seem too
concerned at the possibility.

55:08.089 --> 55:10.089
- Dead is fine with me.

55:10.172 --> 55:11.671
- About time you admitted it.

55:15.214 --> 55:17.963
- If I ever see Thad
again, you're done.

55:19.255 --> 55:21.588
Your whole operation
here will be shut down.

55:23.380 --> 55:25.297
- You've made a lot
of money off of me.

55:27.130 --> 55:29.380
- And you won't be able
to pay me enough to turn

55:29.463 --> 55:32.297
a blind eye anymore, so
it better be as you say.

55:33.546 --> 55:34.797
'Cause if I see Thad again--
- You won't!

55:36.172 --> 55:38.130
I promise.

55:49.380 --> 55:51.047
- Hi, yeah, I'm looking
for Michael Hurt.

55:54.047 --> 55:58.505
- That's his.

55:58.505 --> 55:59.505
- Do you know him?

56:00.421 --> 56:02.630
- Not really.

56:02.713 --> 56:03.838
He rents that from us.

56:05.630 --> 56:06.505
- Thanks.

56:09.089 --> 56:11.339
(dark orchestral music)

56:11.421 --> 56:14.047
(lock rattles)

56:45.963 --> 56:49.505
(camera clicks and whirs)

57:17.255 --> 57:18.421
- [Gayle] I know who you are.

57:18.505 --> 57:20.380
So you don't need to
introduce yourself.

57:22.505 --> 57:24.880
- Well, I know what I'm doin'
here, what're you doin'?

57:24.963 --> 57:26.047
- Looking for Thad,
just like you.

57:27.713 --> 57:29.546
- Well, where's Michael Hurt?

57:29.630 --> 57:32.838
- (sighs) I remember when had
the best hair in the world,

57:32.922 --> 57:35.380
but when he lost it, he
just couldn't take it.

57:35.463 --> 57:39.505
I just know he'd rather be dead
than without his hairpiece.

57:39.588 --> 57:41.838
- Well, so, if you
think he's dead,

57:41.922 --> 57:43.339
who do you think killed him?

57:45.297 --> 57:48.005
- Whatever you're getting
paid to find Thad,

57:48.089 --> 57:49.463
I'll double your pay.
(suspenseful orchestral music)

57:49.546 --> 57:51.588
- I'm not taking on
any new clients now.

57:51.671 --> 57:55.505
Especially when I know when I
find him you'll just kill him.

57:55.588 --> 57:57.922
(Gayle yelps)

57:58.005 --> 58:01.130
You're just a
pseudo-health-nut wacko.

58:01.214 --> 58:02.922
Just because you're able
to trick those people,

58:03.005 --> 58:04.380
doesn't mean you got me fooled!

58:04.463 --> 58:05.922
- Oh, shut up, fatty! (grunts)

58:06.005 --> 58:08.505
(Jake groans)

58:11.463 --> 58:14.963
(dramatic orchestral music)

59:18.297 --> 59:21.005
(blender whirs)

59:31.255 --> 59:33.214
- Do you want almonds
in your smoothie?

59:34.880 --> 59:37.172
(blender whirs)

59:37.255 --> 59:39.172
- You gotta be careful!

59:39.255 --> 59:42.214
Almonds, while very healthy,
have a lot of phytic acid.

59:42.297 --> 59:43.838
- What are you doing?
Put the gun down.

59:43.922 --> 59:45.838
- Tell me where Thad is.

59:45.922 --> 59:46.630
- I thought you knew?
(Gayle chuckles)

59:46.713 --> 59:49.047
- If I knew, he'd be dead.

59:50.214 --> 59:52.172
- Don't say that.
(Gayle chuckles)

59:52.255 --> 59:53.339
- You're both coming with me.

59:53.421 --> 59:56.172
I want my money and to get
the hell out of this town.

59:57.880 --> 59:59.130
But I shouldn't complain.

01:00:00.421 --> 01:00:03.671
Fat, fat, fatties
everywhere you look!

01:00:05.214 --> 01:00:08.463
Which means fat stacks for me.
(dark orchestral music)

01:00:08.546 --> 01:00:11.339
I might as well kill you two
to draw Thad out of hiding.

01:00:11.713 --> 01:00:14.005
Let's go.

01:00:14.089 --> 01:00:14.963
Move.

01:00:54.838 --> 01:00:55.671
Let's go.

01:00:57.671 --> 01:00:58.505
Move it.

01:00:58.838 --> 01:01:00.130
Hurry up.

01:01:10.546 --> 01:01:12.630
It's nothin' personal.

01:01:12.713 --> 01:01:14.546
I just want my money.

01:01:16.463 --> 01:01:18.297
(gun clicks)

01:01:18.380 --> 01:01:22.130
(dramatic orchestral music)

01:01:29.421 --> 01:01:34.421
(chokes and groans)
(dark piano music)

01:01:47.255 --> 01:01:52.005
(thud)
(friend screams)

01:02:00.713 --> 01:02:03.172
(gun fires)

01:02:04.089 --> 01:02:05.005
- Oh, god.

01:02:15.421 --> 01:02:16.505
What did I do?

01:02:18.463 --> 01:02:19.755
- You did the right thing.

01:02:20.339 --> 01:02:21.880
She was gonna kill us.

01:02:24.630 --> 01:02:29.421
- Okay.

01:02:29.505 --> 01:02:31.214
(wind whistles)

01:02:45.130 --> 01:02:46.838
- Did you put my
scarf somewhere?

01:02:46.922 --> 01:02:48.671
- Didn't touch it.

01:02:54.630 --> 01:02:55.838
- Where did my scarf go?

01:02:58.255 --> 01:03:02.713
I think I left it in the
field, it's evidence.

01:03:02.797 --> 01:03:04.797
- I'm aware it's
evidence, Brenda.

01:03:13.630 --> 01:03:15.380
(wind whistles)

01:03:28.297 --> 01:03:33.297
(Gayle gasps)
(suspenseful orchestral music)

01:04:01.214 --> 01:04:02.963
(Gayle groans)

01:04:03.047 --> 01:04:05.880
(car approaches)

01:04:25.963 --> 01:04:28.089
(car door closes)

01:04:28.172 --> 01:04:29.671
Get it and let's
get out of here.

01:04:29.755 --> 01:04:31.755
- I'm sorry if her weight
pulled it off my neck,

01:04:31.838 --> 01:04:33.380
and I didn't notice.
- How could you not notice?

01:04:38.047 --> 01:04:39.922
Where is she?
- I don't know.

01:04:41.297 --> 01:04:43.339
Where did we leave her,
right there, right?

01:04:44.922 --> 01:04:47.047
I'll find her.

01:04:47.130 --> 01:04:48.005
- Where?

01:05:25.297 --> 01:05:26.880
(muffled clunk)

01:05:26.963 --> 01:05:28.838
- Did you feel that?

01:05:35.880 --> 01:05:39.214
(dark orchestral music)

01:05:40.380 --> 01:05:41.713
- I'm over this.

01:05:41.797 --> 01:05:42.671
- Julie.

01:05:43.755 --> 01:05:45.130
Julie, what are you doing?

01:05:45.214 --> 01:05:47.755
- You can do whatever you want,
I am not changing that flat.

01:06:00.963 --> 01:06:04.797
(suspenseful orchestral music)

01:06:29.671 --> 01:06:30.797
- [Man] Good luck.

01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:31.838
- Thanks.

01:06:31.922 --> 01:06:33.089
You know, if I hit it
big, I'm gonna come back,

01:06:33.172 --> 01:06:35.755
and give you a million dollars.

01:06:35.838 --> 01:06:38.214
- That would be
mighty fair of ya.

01:06:43.838 --> 01:06:44.838
- Excuse me, ma'am?

01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:47.713
- Are you okay?

01:06:50.297 --> 01:06:52.671
- I need to use your bathroom.
- It's locked.

01:07:02.671 --> 01:07:03.588
- Bathroom key, hurry.

01:07:10.838 --> 01:07:13.671
(moans)

01:07:27.005 --> 01:07:29.630
(water sprays)

01:07:47.922 --> 01:07:50.755
(moans)

01:07:54.089 --> 01:07:56.297
Obstacles don't
have to stop you.

01:07:56.380 --> 01:08:00.005
Climb through it, go
around it, work through it.

01:08:00.089 --> 01:08:03.255
Climb it, go through
it, work around it.

01:08:03.339 --> 01:08:06.797
Climb it, go through
it or work around it.

01:08:45.005 --> 01:08:47.796
(knocking thuds)

01:08:54.380 --> 01:08:57.130
(knocking thuds)

01:09:01.421 --> 01:09:03.255
(Jake pants)
- Hands up.

01:09:03.339 --> 01:09:05.171
- Okay, yeah.
- Nice and easy.

01:09:05.255 --> 01:09:06.755
- It's about time.

01:09:07.462 --> 01:09:10.171
There's no airflow in there.

01:09:10.255 --> 01:09:11.505
(grunts)

01:09:11.587 --> 01:09:15.214
- Nice and easy!
- Oh, I'm strarving.

01:09:15.296 --> 01:09:16.837
- What's your name?

01:09:16.921 --> 01:09:18.630
- Jake Liebig.

01:09:18.712 --> 01:09:21.255
I'm a private investigator.
- Show me your license.

01:09:23.046 --> 01:09:24.505
Easy!
- Yeah, yeah.

01:09:25.546 --> 01:09:26.755
(groans)

01:09:28.755 --> 01:09:28.796
There.

01:09:32.755 --> 01:09:33.962
- I know who you are.

01:09:35.421 --> 01:09:38.171
And I know what you're
doin' and I don't like it.

01:09:38.255 --> 01:09:40.755
- Yeah, well, I'm
just doin' my job.

01:09:40.837 --> 01:09:42.755
- Time for you to leave anyway.

01:09:42.837 --> 01:09:45.046
Your little case
is over, detective.

01:09:45.130 --> 01:09:46.630
- Why's that?

01:09:46.712 --> 01:09:46.837
- Thad's dead.

01:09:49.630 --> 01:09:51.421
Hiker found his
body this mornin'.

01:09:53.505 --> 01:09:55.421
- [Man] You're not
gonna see much.

01:09:55.505 --> 01:09:56.963
Looks like the
vultures got to him.

01:09:57.047 --> 01:09:58.339
- Vultures did this?

01:10:02.214 --> 01:10:03.797
I've seen worse, but
not in a long time.

01:10:06.214 --> 01:10:07.297
What'd you get off the body?

01:10:07.380 --> 01:10:08.755
- The victim's
wallet and car keys.

01:10:08.838 --> 01:10:10.588
- They're lock-up
with the sheriff.

01:10:10.671 --> 01:10:12.963
- Who'd they belong to?
- Thad Sitter.

01:10:14.963 --> 01:10:18.214
- Well how long before we have
a definitive match on the ID?

01:10:18.297 --> 01:10:20.339
- We should know within
a couple of days.

01:10:33.255 --> 01:10:35.755
(somber orchestral music)

01:11:06.505 --> 01:11:09.713
- If the truck's not
at the trailer...

01:11:10.797 --> 01:11:11.630
Where is it?

01:11:13.797 --> 01:11:16.880
(suspenseful orchestral music)

01:12:25.838 --> 01:12:31.797
(muffled shouting)
(chatter on TV)

01:12:51.671 --> 01:12:54.671
(muffled shouting)

01:13:08.963 --> 01:13:10.922
(knocks)

01:13:18.089 --> 01:13:19.005
- Hey, buddy.

01:13:22.922 --> 01:13:25.421
- Uh, hey, look, I was
gonna come over here

01:13:25.505 --> 01:13:29.797
to tell you to keep it down,
but um, forget it, that's okay.

01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:32.130
- You wanna come in and
have a shot with us?

01:13:32.838 --> 01:13:34.089
- No, it's okay, thank you.

01:13:36.005 --> 01:13:38.047
- Hey, listen, man.

01:13:38.130 --> 01:13:39.005
Let me tell you somethin'.

01:13:39.089 --> 01:13:42.380
When you figure out
life's meaningless,

01:13:42.463 --> 01:13:44.255
this whole world
don't seem so cruel.

01:13:45.671 --> 01:13:48.339
And maybe one day you'll
even start enjoying yourself.

01:13:50.963 --> 01:13:53.713
- Just try to keep it down.
- Are you kiddin'?

01:13:53.797 --> 01:13:57.005
I can't control
these two freaks!

01:13:57.089 --> 01:14:00.713
Woo!
- Come here, daddy!

01:14:00.797 --> 01:14:02.713
(muffled shouting)

01:14:02.797 --> 01:14:04.463
- Well, lookee who I found.

01:14:04.546 --> 01:14:08.089
(camera clicks and whirs)

01:14:11.297 --> 01:14:13.297
- Look, I don't
know who you are,

01:14:13.380 --> 01:14:14.713
but I don't want any trouble.

01:14:14.797 --> 01:14:16.838
- Your ex-wife hired
me to find you.

01:14:17.380 --> 01:14:19.005
- Julie?

01:14:20.546 --> 01:14:22.588
- Yeah, but now I don't
know who wants you worse.

01:14:22.671 --> 01:14:23.963
Her or Gayle Benson.

01:14:25.380 --> 01:14:26.214
- Gayle?

01:14:27.505 --> 01:14:28.671
Does she know where I am?

01:14:28.755 --> 01:14:30.546
- Not yet, but if
you don't want me

01:14:30.630 --> 01:14:33.089
to tell her where you
are, it's gonna cost ya.

01:14:38.671 --> 01:14:39.172
- You can have the money.

01:14:43.255 --> 01:14:44.755
It's brought me
nothin' but trouble.

01:14:46.005 --> 01:14:48.172
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- I saw you out there.

01:14:50.172 --> 01:14:53.297
I don't want any trouble here.
(Jake groans)

01:14:53.380 --> 01:14:58.297
- [Jake] Oh, no. (groans)

01:15:00.505 --> 01:15:01.588
- Just hang in there, okay?

01:15:01.671 --> 01:15:04.047
We'll be at the hospital
in about 10 minutes.

01:15:04.130 --> 01:15:06.005
- Ever had a heart
attack before?

01:15:06.089 --> 01:15:07.505
Just hurry!

01:15:07.588 --> 01:15:08.963
- I'm hurryin'.

01:15:09.047 --> 01:15:11.172
- Thad, I need to talk
to you about Julie.

01:15:13.172 --> 01:15:14.047
- What, is she okay?

01:15:15.505 --> 01:15:16.172
- Gayle tried to kill her, too.

01:15:18.380 --> 01:15:19.505
- What?

01:15:19.588 --> 01:15:20.463
Why?

01:15:24.505 --> 01:15:25.380
Detective.

01:15:33.421 --> 01:15:34.671
Detective.

01:15:34.755 --> 01:15:35.630
Hey, hey.

01:15:42.630 --> 01:15:46.172
(somber orchestral music)

01:16:00.255 --> 01:16:02.339
- [Brenda] You're gonna be okay.

01:16:02.421 --> 01:16:04.005
If you need me, then just call.

01:16:21.588 --> 01:16:25.588
(muffled soft rock music)

01:16:25.671 --> 01:16:30.671
(soft rock music)
(patron chuckles)

01:16:36.671 --> 01:16:37.797
- Thank you.

01:16:49.380 --> 01:16:52.880
- [Barmaid] Alright,
here you go, hon.

01:16:52.963 --> 01:16:55.421
- [Patron] I appreciate that.

towel around here somewhere.
