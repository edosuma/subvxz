SUCH A HARD CONCEPT?

18:10.881 --> 18:13.258
ALL WILL OBEY THE RULE-BOT!

18:13.342 --> 18:15.219
- RULE-BOT!
[laughs]

18:15.302 --> 18:17.763
OKAY, YOU WERE RIGHT,
STA'ABI.

18:19.097 --> 18:19.681
- [growls]

18:19.765 --> 18:21.850
- CONTAINMENT VIOLATION.

18:21.934 --> 18:23.811
MINIONS, STOP HER!

18:23.894 --> 18:28.106
- FORCED TO ACT...
AGAINST MY WILL.

18:28.190 --> 18:32.152
- AND SPEAK...LIKE...
I'M CONSTIPATED!

18:33.612 --> 18:35.572
- NOT MY FAULT!

18:35.656 --> 18:38.992
I'M NOT DOING THIS!

18:46.959 --> 18:48.168
AAH!
[groans]

18:48.252 --> 18:49.211
REMEMBER...

18:49.294 --> 18:52.047
I AM A FELLOW ALIEN.
AAH!

18:52.130 --> 18:55.134
- BACK, OR I WILL BLUDGEON YOU
WITH THIS!

18:55.217 --> 18:56.802
- "THIS"?
"THIS" IS ME!

18:56.885 --> 19:02.099
[groans]
[beeps]

19:02.182 --> 19:04.476
- LAST TIME,
WE BEAT RULE-BOT,

19:04.560 --> 19:08.605
BY MAKING HIM BREAK
HIS OWN RULES.

19:08.689 --> 19:09.565
- OVERLOADED HIS...

19:09.648 --> 19:12.359
LOGIC BOARD!

19:12.442 --> 19:15.737
- AND WHO'S MORE...
ILLOGICAL THAN...B.O.B.?

19:15.821 --> 19:18.323
- I'M A GLASS OF WATER!

19:18.407 --> 19:21.869
- YES,
I MUST BE B.O.B.

19:21.952 --> 19:22.286
- AAH!

19:25.831 --> 19:27.916
- RULE VIOLATION 34-D!

19:28.000 --> 19:29.334
NO ROLLING ON HANGAR FLOOR.

19:29.418 --> 19:33.088
- THIS SANDWICH HAS MANY LAYERS.
- LAYERS?

19:33.172 --> 19:35.424
SANDWICH DISCUSSION IS ILLOGICAL
IN THIS CIRCUMSTANCE.

19:35.507 --> 19:38.343
- MAYBE.
HOLD THAT THOUGHT.

19:38.427 --> 19:40.804
[toilet flushes]

19:40.888 --> 19:43.098
I JUST FLUSHED MYSELF.
YAY!

19:43.182 --> 19:45.225
- YOUR BEHAVIOR IS ILLOGICAL.

19:45.309 --> 19:46.768
IT HAS NO POINT.

19:46.852 --> 19:50.606
- YES, IT IS ROUND.

19:50.689 --> 19:52.858
- ILLOGICAL!
DOES NOT COMPUTE!

19:52.941 --> 19:55.652
NOT--NOT--NOT LOGICAL!

19:55.736 --> 19:57.738
[powers down]

I THINK YOU DID IT!

20:04.369 --> 20:07.122
- HUZZAH!
RULE-BOT ONCE AGAIN IS--

20:07.205 --> 20:08.248
[beeps]
- RULE-BOT HAS FOOLED YOU!

20:08.332 --> 20:10.792
RULE-BOT IMPROVED
ITS LOGIC BOARD

20:10.876 --> 20:12.002
SINCE OUR LAST ENCOUNTER.

20:12.085 --> 20:13.754
ALSO ITS PRACTICAL JOKE BOARD.

20:13.837 --> 20:14.963
HA, HA, HA.

20:15.047 --> 20:18.300
RULE-BOT WILL RULE ALL!

20:18.383 --> 20:19.384

20:52.960 --> 20:54.169
STA'ABI!

20:54.252 --> 20:56.922
[yodeling]

20:59.675 --> 21:01.510
- HA HA.

21:03.136 --> 21:06.181
[clinks glass]

21:06.264 --> 21:07.849
- RULE VIOLATION H-404:

21:07.933 --> 21:11.478
NO LIQUID
IN THE RULE-B-B-B-BOT...

21:14.940 --> 21:16.024
- YEAH!
- YEAH!

21:16.108 --> 21:19.069
- I'M CONTROLLING ME AGAIN.

21:19.152 --> 21:20.237
HOLD ON, LET ME MAKE SURE
WITH A BICEP FLEX.

21:20.320 --> 21:22.698
SHE-GOW!
IT'S ALL GOOD THERE.

21:22.781 --> 21:24.157
NOW LET ME CHECK OUT

21:24.241 --> 21:26.702
[grunts]
OH, YEAH!

21:26.785 --> 21:29.913

21:29.997 --> 21:31.456
- THANK YOU, MASTER.

21:31.540 --> 21:34.376
- WELL, WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE CALL IT A DAY?

21:34.459 --> 21:35.877
- YES, MASTER.

21:35.961 --> 21:37.337
WE SHALL CALL IT A DAY.

21:37.421 --> 21:37.879
SHA'AGOUT!

21:37.963 --> 21:40.841
- UH, OKAY.

21:40.924 --> 21:42.718
SHA'AGOUT TO YOU TOO.
