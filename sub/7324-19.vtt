07:18.168 --> 07:20.010
BUT I'VE HEARD IT.

07:20.010 --> 07:22.873
I TOLD 'EM NOT TO BOTHER
THIS TIME AROUND.

07:22.873 --> 07:24.545
OKAY.

07:24.545 --> 07:26.617
WELL, IF YOU CHANGE
YOUR MIND,

07:26.617 --> 07:27.778
YOU LET ME KNOW.

07:27.778 --> 07:29.149
I WILL.
OKAY.

07:29.149 --> 07:30.721
(singsongy) BUT I WON'T.

07:30.721 --> 07:32.523
(laughs)

07:32.523 --> 07:34.024
OH.
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

07:34.024 --> 07:35.956
WE'RE HALFWAY THROUGH
THE NEW BATCH OF FLASH CARDS.

07:35.956 --> 07:37.628
YEAH, HUNT AND YANG
ARE OUT SICK TODAY,

07:37.628 --> 07:39.760
SO SLOAN'S THE CHIEF,
AND I AM THE CHIEF'S BITCH.

07:39.760 --> 07:40.931
(elevator bell dings)
LUCKY ME.

07:40.931 --> 07:42.092
NO DISTRACTIONS.
KEPNER, HIT ME AGAIN.

07:42.092 --> 07:43.463
OKAY,
A-A WOMAN WITH DYSURIA,

07:43.463 --> 07:44.635
INCOMPLETE VOIDING,

07:44.635 --> 07:46.466
AND A PALPABLE
SUBURETHRAL MASS.

07:46.466 --> 07:47.898
URETHRAL CARCINOMA.

07:47.898 --> 07:49.239
DAMN IT. I HAD ONE OF
THOSE LAST YEAR.

07:49.239 --> 07:51.471
UM, UH, WE DID, UH,

07:51.471 --> 07:53.604
RADIATION
AND SURGICAL EXCISION.

07:53.604 --> 07:55.075
NO! WOULD IT BE,

07:55.075 --> 07:56.476
UH, CHEMO?

07:56.476 --> 07:57.808
AN ECTOPIC URETER,
OR IT COULD BE.

07:57.808 --> 07:59.149
I MEAN, I SCRUBBED IN
ON ONE OF THOSE,

07:59.149 --> 08:01.211
BUT I DON'T REMEMBER
THE TECHNIQUE

08:01.211 --> 08:02.583
THE UROLOGIST USED.
(whispers) DAMN IT.

08:02.583 --> 08:04.114
SOUNDS LIKE
URETHRAL DIVERTICULUM.

08:04.114 --> 08:05.556
(elevator bell dings)

08:05.556 --> 08:07.017
AND IF IT'S PROXIMAL,
I WOULD DO A PARTIAL ABLATION

08:07.017 --> 08:09.790
BECAUSE IT'S MUCH LESS LIKELY
TO RESULT IN A FISTULA.

08:09.790 --> 08:12.663
YOU DON'T EVEN NEED TO KNOW
ADVANCED UROLOGY FOR THE BOARDS.

08:12.663 --> 08:15.566
BUT I DO, BECAUSE THE TORRES
METHOD IS IN ME.

08:15.566 --> 08:16.527
UGH!
TOTAL CRAP.

08:16.527 --> 08:17.868
YOU GET TO STUDY
WITH TORRES

08:17.868 --> 08:19.570
WHILE THE REST OF US
GET TO SINK LIKE ROCKS.

08:19.570 --> 08:21.031
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY
WHEN YOU'RE ALONE IN THE O.R.

08:21.031 --> 08:23.734
AND THE REST OF US ARE WORKING
THE FREE CLINIC AT THE MALL.

08:23.734 --> 08:25.205
MY WHOLE BRAIN IS CRAMMED
WITH SO MANY HYPOTHETICALS,

08:25.205 --> 08:26.537
I CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER
WHAT REAL CASES

08:26.537 --> 08:28.539
I WAS ACTUALLY THERE FOR.
I AM SCREWED.

08:28.539 --> 08:29.880
I'LL TELL YOU WHO'S SCREWED--
YANG.

08:29.880 --> 08:31.181
THE BOARDS
ARE AROUND THE CORNER,

08:31.181 --> 08:33.013
NO ONE'S SEEN HER STUDY,
SHE'S OUT SICK.

08:33.013 --> 08:34.815
SHE'S GONNA GET CREAMED.
YANG IS FINE.

08:34.815 --> 08:36.747
YOU CAN'T JUST PASS THE BOARDS
ON RAW TALENT, OKAY?

08:36.747 --> 08:40.150
IT IS AN ARTIFICIAL ENVIRONMENT,
WHICH REQUIRES MASSIVE AMOUNTS--

08:40.150 --> 08:42.993
CRISTINA IS FINE.
OKAY?

08:44.524 --> 08:46.056
(sighs)

08:46.056 --> 08:47.558
(Owen) WHAT IS THE POINT?

08:47.558 --> 08:48.859
WHAT IS THE POINT?

08:48.859 --> 08:51.101
THE POINT IS,
I WANNA KNOW.

08:51.101 --> 08:53.604
THE POINT IS,
I HAVE A RIGHT--

08:53.604 --> 08:55.035
YOU DON'T HAVE A RIGHT,
NOT TO THIS.

08:55.035 --> 08:56.837
NO, I HAVE A RIGHT
AS YOUR WIFE

08:56.837 --> 08:58.939
TO KNOW WHAT YOU DID.

08:58.939 --> 09:00.941
I'M NOT GONNA DO THIS.

09:00.941 --> 09:03.644
I AM NOT GONNA TELL YOU
EVERY DETAIL.

09:03.644 --> 09:04.975
I CHEATED.

09:04.975 --> 09:06.146
(voice breaking) YES.

09:06.146 --> 09:07.317
I CHEATED.
I DID A HORRIBLE THING.

09:07.317 --> 09:11.551
I KNOW. I KNOW I DID
A HORRIBLE THING.

09:11.551 --> 09:12.953
BUT THIS IS NOT
WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO.

09:12.953 --> 09:14.685
I'M NOT GONNA PLAY
A LITTLE MOVIE

09:14.685 --> 09:17.257
OF ALL OF MY CRIMES SO THAT YOU
CAN DECIDE THAT I'M A MONSTER.

09:17.257 --> 09:18.989
OKAY, WELL, THEN GET OUT.
OH.

09:18.989 --> 09:20.260
(scoffs) YOU WANT ME TO LEAVE?

09:20.260 --> 09:23.664
(cell phone ringing)

09:23.664 --> 09:25.135
YOU'RE ANSWERING THE PHONE?

09:25.135 --> 09:26.597
(normal voice) IT'S MEREDITH.
SHE'S CALLED, LIKE, FIVE TIMES.

09:26.597 --> 09:28.138
IF I DON'T ANSWER IT,
SHE'LL COME OVER,

09:28.138 --> 09:30.270
BECAUSE WE HAVE THE FLU,
REMEMBER?

09:30.270 --> 09:31.642
(beeps)

09:31.642 --> 09:32.603
HEY.

09:32.603 --> 09:33.804
(Meredith) Hey.
H-H-How are you feeling?

09:33.804 --> 09:35.646
Uh, I'm okay.
It's just the flu.

09:35.646 --> 09:37.748
(sighs)

09:37.748 --> 09:39.750
WELL, I SHOULD COME
AND CHECK ON YOU,

09:39.750 --> 09:42.152
BECAUSE IT COULD BE SOMETHING
MORE SERIOUS THAN THE FLU.

09:42.152 --> 09:43.854
NO, IT'S, UH...

09:43.854 --> 09:45.616
IT'S FINE. IT'S THE FLU.

09:46.987 --> 09:48.659
OWEN'S THERE?

09:48.659 --> 09:50.220
Yeah, Owen is here.

09:50.220 --> 09:51.662
UM, HE'S SICK, TOO.

09:51.662 --> 09:53.263

12:22.412 --> 12:24.244
DR. SHEPHERD,
DR. WARREN.

12:24.244 --> 12:25.816
HERE.

12:25.816 --> 12:27.247
MR. COOPER.
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

12:27.247 --> 12:30.050
LIKE I WOULD KILL MY OWN MOTHER
FOR A BURGER AND A SHAKE.

12:30.050 --> 12:31.221
JASON COOPER,

12:31.221 --> 12:34.184
29-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH
ADVANCED JUVENILE ARTHRITIS,

12:34.184 --> 12:35.926
CAUSING FUSION OF THE JAW

12:35.926 --> 12:38.288
AND EXTENSIVE FUSION OF THE C-2,
C-3, AND C-4 VERTEBRAE.

12:38.288 --> 12:40.290
HE'S BEEN ON A FEEDING TUBE
FOR THE PAST EIGHT MONTHS.

12:40.290 --> 12:41.832
NO SOLID FOOD AT ALL.

12:41.832 --> 12:43.834
WELL, DON'T WORRY, MR. COOPER.

12:43.834 --> 12:45.265
AFTER WE BREAK YOUR JAW

12:45.265 --> 12:47.968
AND PUT IN THOSE SWEET
TITANIUM HINGES I MADE FOR YOU,

12:47.968 --> 12:50.440
YOU'LL BE EATING BURGERS
AGAIN REAL SOON.

12:50.440 --> 12:52.542
COULD WE HAVE A WORD
WITH YOU OUTSIDE, PLEASE?

12:52.542 --> 12:54.244
OF COURSE.

12:54.244 --> 12:56.276
BEN AND I DON'T THINK WE
SHOULD DO THE SURGERY TODAY.

12:56.276 --> 12:57.848
WHY NOT?
WITH HIS CERVICAL FUSION,

12:57.848 --> 12:59.079
LYING HIM DOWN
ON AN OPERATING TABLE

12:59.079 --> 13:00.250
IS GONNA PUT PRESSURE
ON THE BASE OF HIS SPINE.

13:00.250 --> 13:02.112
NOT TO MENTION THAT
OROTRACHEAL INTUBATION

13:02.112 --> 13:03.413
IS IMPOSSIBLE ON THIS GUY.

13:03.413 --> 13:04.885
I'LL DO NASOTRACHEAL,

13:04.885 --> 13:06.456
BUT IF THERE'S
ANY COMPROMISE TO THE TUBE

13:06.456 --> 13:08.388
WHILE HE'S UNDER
AND HE'S GOT NO MOBILITY--

13:08.388 --> 13:10.390
LET'S JUST SAY,
I CAN'T GUARANTEE ANYTHING.

13:10.390 --> 13:11.992
WELL, WHAT'S
YOUR RECOMMENDATION?

13:11.992 --> 13:14.224
WELL, WE POSTPONE THE SURGERY
UNTIL OTHER PLANS CAN BE MADE.

13:14.224 --> 13:16.126
AND, DR. AVERY, WHAT WOULD
SUPPORT PERFORMING THE SURGERY

13:16.126 --> 13:17.267
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE?

13:17.267 --> 13:18.969
THE, UH, PATIENT HAS

13:18.969 --> 13:21.171
A MAJOR ABSCESS
IN THE BACK OF HIS MOUTH.

13:21.171 --> 13:22.232
WHICH COULD LEAD TO SEPSIS

13:22.232 --> 13:23.934
OR ENDOCARDITIS.

13:23.934 --> 13:26.336
INFECTION'S A KILLER,
WHICH IS WHY THIS CAN'T WAIT.

13:26.336 --> 13:27.938
SO LET'S FIGURE OUT A WAY

13:27.938 --> 13:29.479
TO GET MR. COOPER
INTO SURGERY ON SCHEDULE.

13:29.479 --> 13:31.311
WELL, FRANKLY, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU THINK I CAN DO FOR HIM

13:31.311 --> 13:33.213
BY 3:00 THIS AFTERNOON.

13:33.213 --> 13:34.945
RISE.
EXCUSE ME?

13:34.945 --> 13:37.317

LOST CAUSES, RIGHT?

13:37.317 --> 13:39.319

POSSIBLE?

13:39.319 --> 13:41.391
RISE TO THE CHALLENGE,
SHEPHERD.

13:41.391 --> 13:43.423
I BELIEVE IN YOU.

13:43.423 --> 13:44.554
RISE.

13:44.554 --> 13:46.156
OH.

13:46.156 --> 13:47.858
(whispers) ALL RIGHT,
GUYS.

13:47.858 --> 13:50.400
(people speaking indistinctly)

13:50.400 --> 13:52.432
SO YOU TAKE ORDERS
FROM SLOAN NOW?

14:05.415 --> 14:06.977
HEY. WHERE DO YOU
THINK YOU'RE--

14:06.977 --> 14:08.949
YOU JUST CAN'T TAKE THOSE.

14:08.949 --> 14:10.951
OH, I WAS JUST GONNA COPY 'EM
AND BRING 'EM RIGHT BACK.

14:10.951 --> 14:12.522
IT'LL, UH, TAKE TWO SECONDS.

14:12.522 --> 14:14.584
THEY DON'T TEACH YOU ABOUT
H.I.P.A.A. IN MED SCHOOL?

14:14.584 --> 14:17.857
YOU DON'T SEE A COPY MACHINE,
DO YOU?

14:17.857 --> 14:19.890
THAT'S BECAUSE THESE CHARTS
ARE PRIVATE.

14:19.890 --> 14:21.261
THEY DON'T GET COPIED

14:21.261 --> 14:23.863
AND THEY DON'T
LEAVE THIS ROOM, EVER.

14:23.863 --> 14:26.036
OH, COME ON.

14:26.036 --> 14:28.868
I'M A FIFTH YEAR. I'M JUST
TRYING TO STUDY FOR MY BOARDS.

14:28.868 --> 14:31.041
I NEED REAL CASES.
SO READ 'EM.

14:31.041 --> 14:33.403
READ 'EM ALL,
BUT THEY DON'T GO OUTTA HERE

14:33.403 --> 14:36.346
EXCEPT IN YOUR BRAIN,
UNDERSTAND?

14:36.346 --> 14:39.309
YEAH, I THINK I DO.

14:39.309 --> 14:40.911
(indistinct conversations)

14:40.911 --> 14:42.082
THERE YOU GO.

14:42.082 --> 14:44.184
HEY, YOU GOT
A BUSY SCHEDULE TODAY?

14:44.184 --> 14:45.485
UH, WHY?

14:45.485 --> 14:47.187
DO YOU NEED HELP
WITH THAT THYROIDECTOMY?

14:47.187 --> 14:49.359
BECAUSE I-I'VE NEVER DONE ONE,
AND I WAS JUST READING ABOUT

14:49.359 --> 14:51.521
HOW IT CAN SOMETIMES
CAUSE A THYROID STORM,

14:51.521 --> 14:53.523
WHICH IS R--
HOW COOL IS THAT, YOU KNOW?

14:53.523 --> 14:54.894
YEAH, MAYBE.

14:54.894 --> 14:56.927

MM-HMM.

14:58.468 --> 15:00.370

15:00.370 --> 15:01.531

15:01.531 --> 15:03.373

TO MEMORIZE THESE?

15:03.373 --> 15:04.534
YEAH.

15:04.534 --> 15:06.606
A-ALL OF THEM?
THAT'LL TAKE FOREVER.

15:06.606 --> 15:08.308
LEXIE, WE NEED YOUR HELP.

15:08.308 --> 15:10.941
WE CAN'T KEEP DOING STUPID
HYPOTHETICALS OFF INDEX CARDS.

15:10.941 --> 15:12.412
WE NEED SOMEONE TO QUESTION US
OFF REAL CASES.

15:12.412 --> 15:13.913

I HAVE POST-OPS.

15:13.913 --> 15:16.516
LEXIE, NEXT YEAR WHEN KAREV
AND I ARE ATTENDINGS,

15:16.516 --> 15:18.418

OUR RECOMMENDATIONS

15:20.120 --> 15:21.421

TO GET OFF ON THE WRONG FOOT?

15:25.095 --> 15:26.496
NO.

15:26.496 --> 15:28.028
NO.

15:28.028 --> 15:29.929
(chair clatters)

15:31.561 --> 15:33.203
GREAT!

15:33.203 --> 15:36.466
IT IS SO MUCH FUN THAT YOU'RE
GONNA BE STUDYING WITH US.

15:36.466 --> 15:38.638
(clatters)

15:38.638 --> 15:41.141
YOU GET TO WATCH
THE GAME TONIGHT.

15:41.141 --> 15:42.312
I DO?

15:42.312 --> 15:44.174
I GOTTA GO TO SOME
GIRLS NIGHT

15:44.174 --> 15:46.476
CALLIE AND ARIZONA
PUT TOGETHER FOR TEDDY.

15:46.476 --> 15:48.048
OH.

15:48.048 --> 15:49.379
I MEAN, THAT'S GOOD,
RIGHT?

15:49.379 --> 15:52.582
WASN'T I GONNA GET SOME LONG
STORY ABOUT HOW THIS IS...

15:52.582 --> 15:54.354
(deepens voice)
"THE GAME OF A LIFETIME,

15:54.354 --> 15:56.987
"AND IF YOU WOULD JUST
SIT STILL FOR FIVE MINUTES,

15:56.987 --> 15:59.529
YOU MIGHT APPRECIATE
THE BEAUTY OF--"

15:59.529 --> 16:01.691
YOU AND I HAVE BEEN ON
COMPLETELY OPPOSITE SCHEDULES

16:01.691 --> 16:03.563
FOR, LIKE, TWO WEEKS.

16:03.563 --> 16:05.565
TUCK IS AT HIS DAD'S.

16:05.565 --> 16:09.069
SO I WASN'T PLANNING
ON WATCHING THE GAME TONIGHT.

16:09.069 --> 16:11.501
YOU WEREN'T?

16:11.501 --> 16:14.044
(woman) THANK YOU, DOCTOR.
NOPE.

16:14.044 --> 16:15.505
WELL, WHAT WERE YOU
PLANNING TO DO?

16:15.505 --> 16:17.547
WELL, I COULD
SAY IT OUT LOUD, BUT...
(woman) HERE YOU GO.

16:17.547 --> 16:20.480
IT WOULD BE INAPPROPRIATE
FOR THE WORKPLACE,

16:20.480 --> 16:22.412
SO I'M JUST GONNA THINK IT.
(elevator bell dings)

16:22.412 --> 16:24.114
(people speaking indistinctly)

16:24.114 --> 16:25.585
(gasps)

16:25.585 --> 16:28.618
(people continue
speaking indistinctly)

16:28.618 --> 16:31.161
OHH. (snickers)

16:39.269 --> 16:41.131
I'M GONNA
GET OUT OF GIRLS NIGHT.

16:41.131 --> 16:42.572
MM-HMM.

16:42.572 --> 16:44.474
(ding)

16:44.474 --> 16:46.005
HEY, I GOT
THE DONOR SCANS.

16:46.005 --> 16:48.738
OH, GREAT.
LET'S SEE WHAT YOU GOT.

16:48.738 --> 16:51.181
(x-ray rustles)

16:51.181 --> 16:54.114
THERE.

16:54.114 --> 16:56.416
BOWEL LOOKS GOOD,
SMALL INTESTINES,

16:56.416 --> 16:59.089
LARGE INTESTINES, AND THAT'S
A GOOD-LOOKING PANCREAS.

16:59.089 --> 17:01.020
LOOK AT THAT
ON THE LIVER RIGHT THERE.

17:01.020 --> 17:02.792
LOOKS LIKE A TUMOR.

17:02.792 --> 17:04.554
WELL, THAT MAKES HIM
AN UNSUITABLE ORGAN DONOR.

17:04.554 --> 17:06.726
NOT NECESSARILY.
COULD BE A BENIGN ADENOMA.

17:06.726 --> 17:09.028
MY PATIENT'S BEEN IN
FOR TWO OTHER TRANSPLANTS,

17:09.028 --> 17:10.500
AND THEY BOTH FELL THROUGH.

17:10.500 --> 17:12.162
HE'S NOT GONNA LIVE MUCH LONGER
WITHOUT A NEW LIVER.

17:12.162 --> 17:13.463
WE COULD RESECT IT.

17:13.463 --> 17:16.606
IT'S A LITTLE UNCONVENTIONAL
TO OPERATE ON A DONOR,

17:16.606 --> 17:19.639
BUT THERE'S NO REASON
WHY IT WOULDN'T WORK.

17:19.639 --> 17:21.411
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA,
BAILEY.

17:21.411 --> 17:23.243
GREAT IDEA?
YOU WANT TO PUT

17:23.243 --> 17:25.545
COMPROMISED ORGANS
INTO A TRANSPLANT RECIPIENT

17:25.545 --> 17:27.677
AND GIVE YOUR GUY CANCER
ON TOP OF EVERYTHING ELSE?

17:27.677 --> 17:29.349
I THINK WE OWE IT TO MY GUY

17:29.349 --> 17:30.820
TO AT LEAST EXCISE
THE TUMOR AND TEST IT.

17:30.820 --> 17:32.652
I DON'T AGREE.

17:32.652 --> 17:36.226
DR. SLOAN, ARE YOU ARGUING
SURGICAL PROTOCOL

17:36.226 --> 17:38.288
WITH DR. WEBBER?

17:38.288 --> 17:40.390
DR. BAILEY...
ARE YOU ARGUING

17:40.390 --> 17:44.134
WITH THE DECISION
OF THE CHIEF OF SURGERY?

17:48.238 --> 17:49.639
CALL U.N.O.S.

17:49.639 --> 17:51.101
TELL THEM
THIS DONOR'S UNSUITABLE.

17:51.101 --> 17:53.543
PUT MR. SHERIDAN
BACK ON THE LIST.

18:04.684 --> 18:06.116
WE'VE PUT YOU BACK
ON THE TRANSPLANT LIST.

18:06.116 --> 18:08.858
AND A NEW SET OF ORGANS
CAN COME IN AT ANY TIME.

18:08.858 --> 18:11.521
CUT THE CRAP,
DR. WEBBER.

18:11.521 --> 18:14.124
YOU AND I BOTH KNOW
I'M NOT GONNA MAKE IT

18:14.124 --> 18:16.826
TO SEE THE SUNRISE TOMORROW

18:16.826 --> 18:20.170
LET ALONE
TO STICK AROUND FOR...

18:20.170 --> 18:23.233
FOR SOME OTHER POOR SAD SACK
TO KICK IT.

18:23.233 --> 18:25.104
MR. SHERIDAN, IS THERE
ANYONE WE CAN CALL FOR YOU--

18:25.104 --> 18:27.237
YOUR FAMILY, YOUR SISTERS,
YOUR FRIENDS?

18:27.237 --> 18:28.838
ARE YOU KIDDING?

18:28.838 --> 18:32.242
THANK GOD MY FAMILY'S
NOT AROUND FOR THIS.

18:32.242 --> 18:34.844
IT'S LIKE LUCY
WITH A FOOTBALL,

18:34.844 --> 18:36.646
EXCEPT IT'S MY LIFE.
(chuckles)

18:36.646 --> 18:39.449
IT WOULD KILL THEM WORSE
THAN THE FIRST TWO TIMES

18:39.449 --> 18:41.891
TO COME IN HERE
AND SAY GOOD-BYE TO ME.

18:41.891 --> 18:45.825
(sighs) WE'RE ALL ALONE
IN THIS WORLD, SUNSHINE.

18:45.825 --> 18:49.659
ANYBODY WHO TELLS YOU
ANY DIFFERENT IS LYING

18:49.659 --> 18:52.262
OR TRYING
TO S-SELL YOU SOMETHING.

18:52.262 --> 18:53.403
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

18:53.403 --> 18:55.835
(sighs) NOW YOU...

18:55.835 --> 18:59.209
YOU ARE THE BEST DOCTOR
I EVER HAD.

18:59.209 --> 19:01.411
SO DON'T BEAT YOURSELF UP
ABOUT THIS.

19:01.411 --> 19:04.614
IT'S DONE. IT'S OVER.

19:04.614 --> 19:06.916
YOU DID EVERYTHING
YOU COULD.

19:06.916 --> 19:08.278
(beeping continues)

19:08.278 --> 19:10.520
NO.

19:10.520 --> 19:12.151
NO, I DIDN'T.

19:12.151 --> 19:13.323
SIR.

19:13.323 --> 19:16.155
BAILEY, YOUR TUMOR RESECTION
IDEA WAS SOUND.

19:16.155 --> 19:19.289
AND THERE WAS NO REASON WHY
THOSE ORGANS WOULDN'T WORK.

19:19.289 --> 19:23.233
WELL, THE DONOR
IS STILL ON LIFE SUPPORT.

19:23.233 --> 19:24.694
THE ORGAN RECOVERY
FOR THE HEART AND LUNGS

19:24.694 --> 19:26.466
ISN'T SCHEDULED
TILL THIS AFTERNOON.

19:26.466 --> 19:27.637
(clenched teeth)
BUT DR. SLOAN S--

19:27.637 --> 19:29.299
YOU LET ME DEAL
WITH CHIEF SLOAN.

19:29.299 --> 19:32.442
♪♪♪

19:32.442 --> 19:33.873
(Mark) WHEN YOU'RE THE CHIEF,

19:33.873 --> 19:36.376
YOU GOTTA MAKE
THE HARD DECISIONS.

19:36.376 --> 19:38.208
WEBBER KNOWS THAT.
IT COMES WITH THE JOB.

19:38.208 --> 19:40.280
WHO'S OUR FIRST APPOINTMENT,
AVERY?

19:40.280 --> 19:41.951
NO ONE ON THE SCHEDULE,
CHIEF.

19:41.951 --> 19:43.653
THAT'S WHY YOU SHOULDA
CALLED IT "BEEF WITH THE CHIEF."

19:43.653 --> 19:45.215
PEOPLE WOULD'VE SHOWN UP
FOR THAT.

19:45.215 --> 19:48.318
(indistinct conversations)

19:48.318 --> 19:50.220
YOU GOT A BEEF?

19:50.220 --> 19:53.663
ACTUALLY, I WOULD REALLY LOVE
TO GO STUDY FOR MY BOARDS.

19:53.663 --> 19:55.325
NO.

19:55.325 --> 19:57.267
I KNOW, I DON'T HAVE
AN APPOINTMENT,

19:57.267 --> 19:59.499
BUT DO YOU HAVE A MOMENT
TO TALK ABOUT JASON COOPER'S

19:59.499 --> 20:00.830
JAW RECONSTRUCTION?

20:00.830 --> 20:02.332
THAT'S FINE. HE'S WIDE OPEN.
HAVE A SEAT.

20:02.332 --> 20:03.603
THERE YOU GO.

20:03.603 --> 20:05.575
I THINK I CAN CARVE
OUT OF FOAM

20:05.575 --> 20:06.936
A CRADLE THAT HOLDS
THE PATIENT'S HEAD AND NECK

20:06.936 --> 20:08.207
DURING SURGERY,

20:08.207 --> 20:10.340
REDUCING THE CHANCE OF
RESPIRATORY COMPLICATION.

20:10.340 --> 20:12.482
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

20:12.482 --> 20:14.844
BUT YOU CAN DO BETTER.
EXCUSE ME?

20:14.844 --> 20:16.215
WELL, FOAM'S FINE
IF NOTHING GOES WRONG,

20:16.215 --> 20:16.986
BUT IT WON'T BE
FLEXIBLE ENOUGH

20:16.986 --> 20:18.588
IF WE HAVE TO ADJUST HIM
MID-SURGERY.

20:18.588 --> 20:20.290
IT'S A GOOD IDEA, BUT--
ARE YOU AWARE...

20:20.290 --> 20:21.351
I'M AWARE...
OF WHAT--

20:21.351 --> 20:23.323
THAT THAT SURGERY
IS TAKING PLACE AT 3:00,

20:23.323 --> 20:26.726
AND JASON COOPER'S AIRWAY
NEEDS TO BE SECURED.

20:26.726 --> 20:28.498
SO RISE, SHEPHERD.

20:28.498 --> 20:29.729
RISE.

20:29.729 --> 20:31.230

20:31.230 --> 20:34.003
HEY, UM, I CAN'T DO
LADIES NIGHT.

20:34.003 --> 20:35.365
SORRY.
MM. WHAT?

20:35.365 --> 20:36.536
BUT WE NEED YOU.

20:36.536 --> 20:38.868
WELL, UM, I CAN'T COME
BECAUSE,

20:38.868 --> 20:41.010

YEAH.

20:46.876 --> 20:48.918
AND SALSA? (chuckles)

20:48.918 --> 20:50.850
NO, YOU JUST WANT TO GO HOME
AND GET LAID.

20:50.850 --> 20:54.023
HEY, WE HAVE A LONG-STANDING
SALSA APPOINTMENT TONIGHT,

20:54.023 --> 20:56.426
AND... SORRY.
YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.

20:56.426 --> 20:57.587
RIGHT.

20:57.587 --> 20:58.758
I BET IT'S GONNA BE LONG.

20:58.758 --> 21:00.660
MM-HMM. REAL LONG.

21:00.660 --> 21:02.261
SHE'S ALMOST FINISHED.

21:02.261 --> 21:04.434
SHE HAS READ ALL OF
YOUR CHARTS AND NONE OF MINE.

21:04.434 --> 21:05.835
YEAH, I FOUND HER.
I BROUGHT HER HERE.

21:05.835 --> 21:08.298
HEY, LEX, CAN YOU TAKE A LOOK
AT SOME OF MY CASES, TOO?

21:08.298 --> 21:10.470
OR NOT. I MEAN, IT'S--
IT'S FINE IF--

21:10.470 --> 21:11.801
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO.

21:11.801 --> 21:13.303
IT'S OKAY. I-I CAN.
I-I WILL--
THANK YOU.

21:13.303 --> 21:14.804
NO, NO, NO, NO,
YOU WILL NOT.

21:14.804 --> 21:16.376
NOT UNTIL
SHE'S FINISHED WITH MINE.

21:16.376 --> 21:18.878
OKAY, THESE
TAKE PRIORITY, LEXIE.

21:18.878 --> 21:20.510
YOU DON'T NEED LEXIE.
YOU GOT TORRES.

21:20.510 --> 21:22.352
THEY'RE FOR CRISTINA.
SHE'S NOT EVEN HERE.

21:22.352 --> 21:23.653
WHICH IS WHY
SHE NEEDS THE HELP.
SHE DOES NOT NEED THE HELP.

21:23.653 --> 21:25.315
SHE JUST NEEDS TO FINISH MINE.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

21:25.315 --> 21:26.285
(Alex, Meredith, and April

21:26.285 --> 21:28.287

21:29.719 --> 21:31.391

21:31.391 --> 21:34.293
YEAH, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
THERE IS NO COMPROMISE.

21:34.293 --> 21:36.396
YOU DON'T HAVE HALF
A BABY.

21:36.396 --> 21:38.428

I DON'T KNOW THE WHOLE STORY.

24:18.488 --> 24:19.659
SHE DIDN'T TELL YOU?

24:19.659 --> 24:20.830
NO, HE TOLD ME.

24:20.830 --> 24:23.933
HUNT TOLD YOU?

24:23.933 --> 24:26.596
HE TOLD ME, BUT HE DIDN'T
REALLY KNOW HE WAS TELLING ME,

24:26.596 --> 24:28.097
BUT THAT'S HOW I KNOW.

24:28.097 --> 24:29.599
DOES CRISTINA KNOW YOU KNOW?

24:29.599 --> 24:31.841
SHE KNOWS. I MEAN, SHE DOESN'T
KNOW, BUT SHE KNOWS.

24:31.841 --> 24:33.142
I KNOW SHE KNOWS.

24:33.142 --> 24:34.504
SO DON'T YOU WANT TO TALK
TO HER ABOUT IT?

24:34.504 --> 24:35.705
BUT I CAN'T TALK ABOUT IT
WITH HER,

24:35.705 --> 24:37.647
BECAUSE THEN WE WOULD BE
TALKING ABOUT IT.

24:37.647 --> 24:38.978
DON'T YOU WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT?

24:38.978 --> 24:40.109
YES, BUT NOT LIKE THAT.

24:40.109 --> 24:41.811
(woman speaks indistinctly)

24:41.811 --> 24:42.812
(sighs)

24:42.812 --> 24:44.614
WELL, I HOPE
THEY FIGURE IT OUT.

24:44.614 --> 24:46.485
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T STAND SLOAN
AS YOUR BOSS?

24:46.485 --> 24:47.887
AMONG OTHER THINGS, YES.

24:47.887 --> 24:49.659
ZOLA.

24:49.659 --> 24:52.091
(gruff voice)
I'M GONNA GET YOU.

24:52.091 --> 24:53.593
(growls)

24:53.593 --> 24:55.525
(Meredith laughs)

24:55.525 --> 24:57.096
(growls)

24:57.096 --> 24:58.698
(laughs)

24:58.698 --> 25:01.531
(growls and speaks indistinctly
with baby-talk voice)

25:01.531 --> 25:03.533
(laughs)

25:03.533 --> 25:04.874
HE DOES HAVE A POINT

25:04.874 --> 25:07.076
ABOUT STABILIZING
THE SPINE WITH FOAM.

25:07.076 --> 25:08.778
(children laugh)

25:11.941 --> 25:13.613
HEY. I GOT YOUR PAGE.
WHAT'S UP?

25:13.613 --> 25:15.514
SLIGHT CHANGE OF PLANS.

25:15.514 --> 25:16.846
YOU'RE TAKING
SOFIA TONIGHT.

25:16.846 --> 25:18.187
OH, YEAH. WE CAN'T.

25:18.187 --> 25:20.690
NO, WE GOT A LADIES NIGHT
WITH ALTMAN.

25:20.690 --> 25:21.851
(people speaking indistinctly)

25:21.851 --> 25:23.092
YOU'RE TAKING ALTMAN
TO A CHICK BAR?

25:23.092 --> 25:24.954
IT CAN MEAN OTHER THINGS.

25:24.954 --> 25:26.525
IT'S--IT'S YOUR NIGHT
WITH SOFIA.

25:26.525 --> 25:28.758
I DON'T KNOW HOW LATE I'M GONNA
HAVE TO BE HERE TONIGHT.

25:28.758 --> 25:30.529
OH, SERIOUSLY?
SERIOUSLY.

25:30.529 --> 25:31.861
I HAVE CHIEF STUFF TO DO.

25:31.861 --> 25:33.062
UGH.

25:33.062 --> 25:34.664
AND YOU STILL OWE ME
FOR VALENTINE'S DAY.

25:34.664 --> 25:35.835
(elevator bell dings)

25:35.835 --> 25:37.066
KEPNER.

25:37.066 --> 25:39.068
(woman)
HERE YOU GO, DOCTOR.
OKAY.

25:39.068 --> 25:40.740
REMIND ME--

25:40.740 --> 25:42.742
HOW LONG'S IT TAKE
TO DO AN APPY?

25:42.742 --> 25:44.043
WELL, IF YOU, UH,
PERF THE BOWEL, THEN--

25:44.043 --> 25:47.076
THEN IT TAKES, UH, UH,
IT COULD TAKE HOURS.

25:47.076 --> 25:50.149
OR, UH, IF--IF THE PATIENT
HEMORRHAGES, OR IF THE PATIENT--

25:50.149 --> 25:51.721
THIS ISN'T YOUR BOARDS,
KEPNER.

25:51.721 --> 25:53.823
HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE
TO DO AN APPY...

25:53.823 --> 25:55.855
IN THE REAL WORLD?

25:55.855 --> 25:58.788
45 MINUTES
TO AN HOUR AND 15, TOPS.

25:58.788 --> 26:00.690
THEN WHY DO BAILEY AND GREY
HAVE EIGHT HOURS BLOCKED

26:00.690 --> 26:02.962
IN O.R. TWO?

26:02.962 --> 26:05.735
M-MAYBE IT'S
A REALLY COMPLICATED APPY.

26:05.735 --> 26:07.897
KEPNER.

26:07.897 --> 26:10.239
(woman speaks indistinctly
over p.a.)

26:10.239 --> 26:11.741
KEPNER.

26:11.741 --> 26:15.104
(sighs) DR. WEBBER WAS THE CHIEF
FOR A REALLY, REALLY LONG TIME.

26:15.104 --> 26:16.275
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

26:16.275 --> 26:17.907
DO NOT TOUCH THAT PATIENT!

26:17.907 --> 26:21.180
OH, DR. SLOAN, IF--IF YOU WOULD
JUST LET US DO OUR JOBS--

26:21.180 --> 26:23.112
I'M DOING MY JOB,
DR. BAILEY.

26:23.112 --> 26:25.584
AND TODAY MY JOB IS TO BE
THE CHIEF OF SURGERY,

26:25.584 --> 26:27.256
AND AS THE CHIEF OF SURGERY,

26:27.256 --> 26:29.158
I TOLD YOU NOT TO PERFORM
THIS PROCEDURE.

26:29.158 --> 26:31.290
SO DO NOT TOUCH HIM.
TAKE HIM BACK TO HIS ROOM.

26:31.290 --> 26:34.894
PUT HIM BACK
ON THE TRANSPLANT LIST.

26:34.894 --> 26:37.196
(door opens and closes)

26:37.196 --> 26:38.868
(Neil) SEE?

26:38.868 --> 26:41.100
I TOLD YOU
THIS WOULD NEVER WORK.

26:41.100 --> 26:42.732
(beeping continues)

26:42.732 --> 26:44.704
DR. WEBBER.

26:44.704 --> 26:46.205
CHIEF SLOAN.

26:46.205 --> 26:48.037
WAS I NOT CLEAR
THIS MORNING?

26:48.037 --> 26:49.178
(suction gurgling)

26:49.178 --> 26:51.610
YOU MEAN THIS?

26:51.610 --> 26:53.783
THIS IS A BENIGN ADENOMA.

26:53.783 --> 26:56.245
I'VE BEEN A GENERAL SURGEON
FOR ALMOST 30 YEARS.

26:56.245 --> 26:58.187
I KNOW A BENIGN ADENOMA
WHEN I SEE ONE.

26:58.187 --> 26:59.348
I'D STAKE MY CAREER
ON IT.

26:59.348 --> 27:01.150
IF THERE'S A TUMOR
IN THE DONOR ORGANS,

27:01.150 --> 27:03.152
THEN THEY'VE BEEN COMPROMISED.

27:03.152 --> 27:06.155
YOU KNOW THIS.
I DIDN'T MAKE THOSE RULES.

27:06.155 --> 27:07.827
YOU'RE A GOOD DOCTOR,

27:07.827 --> 27:11.230
AND YOU MAY ONE DAY MAKE
A GREAT CHIEF OF SURGERY.

27:11.230 --> 27:13.402
BUT YOU'RE A PLASTIC SURGEON,
CHIEF SLOAN.

27:13.402 --> 27:15.835
YOU'RE A PERFECTIONIST.

27:15.835 --> 27:17.236
AND YOU WANT EVERYTHING
BY THE RULES

27:17.236 --> 27:19.168
SO IT'LL END UP PRETTY.

27:19.168 --> 27:21.040
WELL, I DON'T NEED PRETTY.

27:21.040 --> 27:23.272
AND I DON'T NEED PERFECT.

27:23.272 --> 27:25.374
WHAT I NEED
IS FOR THIS TO WORK.

27:25.374 --> 27:27.076
AND WHAT'S GONNA MAKE IT WORK

27:27.076 --> 27:29.248
IS FOR ME
TO TAKE OUT THAT TUMOR

27:29.248 --> 27:32.251
AND PUT THESE HEALTHY ORGANS
INSIDE MY VERY SICK PATIENT.

27:32.251 --> 27:34.183
IT WON'T BE PRETTY,

27:34.183 --> 27:35.685
BUT IT WILL WORK,

27:35.685 --> 27:37.957
AND IT WILL KEEP
MY PATIENT ALIVE.

27:37.957 --> 27:39.829
STAND DOWN, CHIEF SLOAN.

27:39.829 --> 27:41.360
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

27:41.360 --> 27:42.992
STAND DOWN.

27:42.992 --> 27:46.265
(beeping continues)

27:46.265 --> 27:49.068
A LITTLE MORE
SUCTION RIGHT HERE.

27:49.068 --> 27:51.741
(suction gurgles)

27:51.741 --> 27:53.042
(rattles door)

27:53.042 --> 27:55.044
CRISTINA, PLEASE.

27:55.044 --> 27:57.446
OPEN THE DOOR, PLEASE.

27:57.446 --> 27:59.108
(exhales)

27:59.108 --> 28:02.852
CRISTINA,
IF YOU DON'T OPEN THE DOOR...

28:02.852 --> 28:04.253
ARE YOU OKAY?

28:04.253 --> 28:06.355
CRISTINA...

28:06.355 --> 28:09.218
ARE YOU HURTING YOURSELF
IN THERE?

28:09.218 --> 28:10.960
(sighs) CRISTINA, PLEASE.

28:10.960 --> 28:12.461
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

28:12.461 --> 28:14.263
(rattles door)

28:14.263 --> 28:15.965
(grunts)

28:15.965 --> 28:17.266
CRISTINA, IF YOU DON'T
OPEN THE DOOR,

28:17.266 --> 28:19.268
I'M GONNA
HAVE TO BREAK IT IN.

28:19.268 --> 28:21.300
I'M GONNA HAVE TO, SO...

28:21.300 --> 28:23.302
IF YOU'RE ALL RIGHT,
JUST OPEN THE DOOR.

28:23.302 --> 28:25.174
(door rattles)

28:25.174 --> 28:26.335
(slaps wood)

28:26.335 --> 28:27.777
OKAY, I'M BREAKING IN
THE DOOR.

28:27.777 --> 28:30.309
SO IF YOU'RE CLOSE TO THE DOOR,
THEN JUST... GET BACK,

28:30.309 --> 28:32.281
'CAUSE I'M BREAKING IT IN
RIGHT NOW.

28:32.281 --> 28:34.213
I AM. SO...

28:34.213 --> 28:36.445
ALL RIGHT. ONE...

28:36.445 --> 28:38.187
TWO...

28:38.187 --> 28:39.348
THREE.

28:39.348 --> 28:40.489
(thuds)

28:40.489 --> 28:42.321
(inhales sharply) AHH.

28:42.321 --> 28:44.253
OUCH.

28:44.253 --> 28:45.294
(giggles)

28:45.294 --> 28:49.198
(laughing)

28:49.198 --> 28:51.500
YEAH, I P--
THAT WAS PRETTY LAME.

28:51.500 --> 28:54.163
I LOOK LIKE A TOTAL...
(laughing)

28:54.163 --> 28:57.166
(continues laughing)

29:01.941 --> 29:03.112
CRISTINA?

29:03.112 --> 29:06.115
(continues laughing)

29:08.517 --> 29:12.782
I-I HAVE AN M.D.
AND A PhD,

29:12.782 --> 29:15.124
I AM A FREAKING
CARDIOTHORACIC SURGEON...

29:15.124 --> 29:18.357
(continues laughing)

29:18.357 --> 29:22.331
I-I AM SUPPOSED TO BE
STUDYING FOR MY BOARDS--

29:22.331 --> 29:24.293
THE MOST IMPORTANT EXAM
OF MY LIFE,

29:24.293 --> 29:27.066
AND I'M...
(continues laughing)

29:27.066 --> 29:31.400
AND I'M--I'M--I'M--I'M LOCKED
IN A BATHROOM CRYING...

29:31.400 --> 29:33.102
(continues laughing)

29:33.102 --> 29:34.904
BECAUSE OF A BOY.

29:34.904 --> 29:37.907
(continues laughing)

29:40.509 --> 29:43.212
(continues laughing)

29:43.212 --> 29:44.483
(stops laughing)

29:47.987 --> 29:51.520
(exhales deeply)

30:07.576 --> 30:09.478
I THINK IT WOULD BE EASIER

30:09.478 --> 30:11.911
IF SHE WAS SOMEONE
YOU HAD FALLEN IN LOVE WITH.

30:11.911 --> 30:13.212
NO, IT WOULDN'T
HAVE BEEN EASIER.

30:13.212 --> 30:15.214
NO, IT WOULD.

30:15.214 --> 30:19.118
IT WOULD BE CLEAR...
AND CLEAN.

30:20.850 --> 30:24.153
YOU WOULD BE LEAVING ME
FOR HER.

30:24.153 --> 30:26.155
YOU WOULD'VE FALLEN
OUT OF LOVE WITH ME

30:26.155 --> 30:28.457
AND IN LOVE WITH HER.

30:28.457 --> 30:30.960
WHEN YOU SLEPT WITH HER,

30:30.960 --> 30:32.962
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ABLE
TO CONTROL YOURSELF

30:32.962 --> 30:34.263
BECAUSE OF ALL THE LOVE.

30:34.263 --> 30:37.266
CRISTINA, IT WOULD NOT
HAVE BEEN EASIER.

30:40.109 --> 30:41.270
IT WAS JUST SEX?

30:41.270 --> 30:43.242
IT WAS JUST SEX.

30:44.213 --> 30:46.215
JUST ONCE.

30:50.249 --> 30:51.951
OH, I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

30:51.951 --> 30:53.122
WHAT? WHAT DON'T YOU--

30:53.122 --> 30:56.325
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW YOU...

30:56.325 --> 30:59.028
I DON'T UNDERSTAND...

30:59.028 --> 31:01.030
WHY YOU WOULD SLEEP
WITH ANOTHER WOMAN.

31:01.030 --> 31:02.861
CRISTINA...

31:02.861 --> 31:04.463
(scoffs)
I DON'T KNOW.

31:04.463 --> 31:06.635
I-I...

31:06.635 --> 31:10.099
I WAS... LONELY
BECAUSE WE WERE FIGHTING

31:10.099 --> 31:12.301
AND... (sighs)

31:12.301 --> 31:14.343
I WAS AFRAID OF WHAT WAS
HAPPENING TO US,

31:14.343 --> 31:15.644
AND I JUST GOT DRUNK

31:15.644 --> 31:18.477
AND I DID
AN INCREDIBLY STUPID THING.

31:18.477 --> 31:20.209
AND I--
PEOPLE MAKE MISTAKES.

31:20.209 --> 31:22.551
I MAKE MISTAKES.
YOU MAKE MISTAKES.

31:22.551 --> 31:25.254
OKAY,
IF YOU'RE GONNA...

31:25.254 --> 31:27.016
BRING UP THE ABORTION AGAIN...
OHH.

31:27.016 --> 31:28.557
IF YOU'RE GONNA SAY THAT
YOU HAD SEX WITH SOMEONE

31:28.557 --> 31:30.319
BECAUSE I HAD AN ABORTION--

31:30.319 --> 31:33.362
I HAD SEX WITH SOMEONE
BECAUSE I WAS HURT.

31:33.362 --> 31:34.523
AND YOU WANTED
TO HURT ME BACK?

31:34.523 --> 31:36.996
I DON'T--CRISTINA...

31:36.996 --> 31:39.598
♪♪♪

31:39.598 --> 31:41.270
YOU WANTED TO HURT ME BACK.

31:41.270 --> 31:45.334
♪♪♪

31:55.184 --> 31:58.387
OH, MY GOD.
YOU WANTED TO HURT ME BACK.

31:59.548 --> 32:01.420
OH, MARK CAN'T TAKE
SOFIA TONIGHT...

32:01.420 --> 32:02.551
(groans)
OR WON'T.

32:02.551 --> 32:04.093
WELL, HE CAN'T.

32:04.093 --> 32:05.354
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

32:05.354 --> 32:06.495
WELL, WE COULD HAVE
LADIES NIGHT AT OUR PLACE.

32:06.495 --> 32:08.197
UM, JUST THE TWO OF US...

32:08.197 --> 32:09.498
AT HOME... WITH TEDDY?

32:09.498 --> 32:11.260
OH, I HATE LADIES NIGHT.

32:11.260 --> 32:13.963
WELL, IT COULD BE GREAT
IF WE COULD DITCH TEDDY.

32:13.963 --> 32:16.365
AW, THAT'S SO, SO HORRIBLE.

32:16.365 --> 32:19.368
COME ON. WE CAN DO
SOME SALSA DANCIN'.

32:19.368 --> 32:20.509
(elevator bell dings)

32:20.509 --> 32:22.371
MM. BUT DO YOU THINK
TEDDY WOULD UNDERSTAND?

32:22.371 --> 32:23.672
YEAH, WE'LL RESCHEDULE.
IT'S NOT LIKE WE'RE CANCELING.

32:23.672 --> 32:25.944
OH, ARE WE BAD PEOPLE?
WE'RE BAD LADIES.

32:25.944 --> 32:27.276
MAYBE.

32:27.276 --> 32:30.449
(lowered, sexy voice)
MAYBE VERY BAD.

32:30.449 --> 32:31.680
(laughs)

32:31.680 --> 32:33.222
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

32:33.222 --> 32:34.553
OKAY.

32:34.553 --> 32:37.586
OUT WITH THE BAD.

32:37.586 --> 32:41.290
AND IN WITH THE GOOD.

32:41.290 --> 32:43.432
ON THE COUNT OF THREE.

32:43.432 --> 32:45.034
READY.
ONE,

32:45.034 --> 32:47.396
TWO... CAREFUL...

32:47.396 --> 32:49.438
AND THREE.

32:49.438 --> 32:51.040
(beeping continues)

32:51.040 --> 32:52.301
EASY. WATCH THE CLAMPS.

32:52.301 --> 32:53.642
(Meredith) I HAVE THE CLAMPS.
I GOT 'EM.

32:53.642 --> 32:55.304
(Miranda) ALL RIGHT.
EASY, EASY, GIRL.

32:55.304 --> 32:57.046
(Richard) OKAY. OKAY.

33:00.349 --> 33:02.381
(exhales)
(chuckles)

33:02.381 --> 33:03.452
(laughs)

33:03.452 --> 33:04.583
SO THE BEANBAG
WILL STABILIZE

33:04.583 --> 33:06.715
MR. COOPER'S CERVICAL SPINE.

33:06.715 --> 33:09.318
AND IT'S FLEXIBLE ENOUGH
THAT DR. WARREN

33:09.318 --> 33:11.620
CAN INTUBATE AND REPOSITION
IF HE NEEDS TO.

33:11.620 --> 33:15.324
ONCE HE INTUBATES, I WILL
LEAVE THE SURGERY TO YOU.

33:15.324 --> 33:17.126
A BEANBAG?

33:17.126 --> 33:18.427
