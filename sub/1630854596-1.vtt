-things out from there. Yes.
-Canada?

09:23.606 --> 09:24.955
Allison, why would
we go to Canada?

09:24.999 --> 09:26.435
Because I love you,
and I have never

09:26.478 --> 09:28.655
seen my father
this angry before.

09:28.698 --> 09:31.614
Okay, all right, babe,
I think we're overreacting.

09:31.658 --> 09:33.311
-No, he freaked me out.
-Just a bit-- baby,

09:33.355 --> 09:35.183
I don't even speak French.

09:35.226 --> 09:37.185
-That's not...
-[chuckling]

09:37.228 --> 09:38.969
You're overreacting, come on,
let me get your bag.

09:39.013 --> 09:40.841
I'm not overreacting...

09:40.884 --> 09:43.495
Come on, just--
just sit down, just sit down.

09:45.410 --> 09:47.848
We're gonna stay right here.

09:47.891 --> 09:49.719
I'm gonna graduate,
I'm gonna spend the whole summer

09:49.763 --> 09:51.895
loving you, and then
I'm gonna go to Alabama

09:51.939 --> 09:55.029
to become
the best football player ever.

09:55.072 --> 09:56.726
-Okay?
-Okay.

09:56.770 --> 09:59.033
All right.

09:59.076 --> 10:02.297
Uh, I meant to give you
this last night.

10:02.340 --> 10:04.560
We were having too much fun.

10:06.475 --> 10:09.391
-Your championship ring?
-Yeah.

10:09.434 --> 10:12.220
-Oh, I can't.
-Yes you can.

10:12.263 --> 10:13.743
Just give it back
in two years

10:13.787 --> 10:15.615
when you're a freshman at Bama.

10:17.312 --> 10:20.445
-[sniffling]
-Hey, baby, baby, baby.

10:21.969 --> 10:24.058
What's wrong?

10:25.712 --> 10:27.539
Nothing.

10:27.583 --> 10:28.932
I don't think
I could ever love anything

10:28.976 --> 10:30.586
as much as I love you.

10:34.024 --> 10:36.461
Well, then,
if you love me,

10:36.505 --> 10:38.159
say it.

10:38.202 --> 10:39.943
[chuckling]
Stop it.

10:39.987 --> 10:42.380
Nah, mm-mm, I love you.

10:42.424 --> 10:44.252
I just proved it.

10:44.295 --> 10:46.080
If you love me,
then say it.

10:50.171 --> 10:54.436
-Roll tide.
-Oh, yeah, that's my girl.

10:54.479 --> 10:56.525
-Say it again.
-Roll tide.

10:56.568 --> 10:58.658
Oh, say it
like you mean it, woman.

11:00.224 --> 11:03.837
-Roll tide.
-Roll tide.

11:09.233 --> 11:10.670
[chuckling]

11:10.713 --> 11:12.715
J, dawg,
if I'm-a win another chip,

11:12.759 --> 11:14.499
I'm-a need
my blind side protected,

11:14.543 --> 11:16.458
-that's the bottom line.
-Hey, I need Kelly

11:16.501 --> 11:17.981
to stop fasting
from sex on Tuesdays.

11:18.025 --> 11:19.766
Will she? I don't know.
You know why?

11:19.809 --> 11:21.593
Because just like who the Sabers
take with the fifth pick,

11:21.637 --> 11:23.683
-it's not my call!
-Malik Wright!

11:23.726 --> 11:26.207
-Mr. MVP.
-Ha ha, Chance Worley,

11:26.250 --> 11:28.339
the new union king,
what's up, baby?

11:28.383 --> 11:30.907
As the face of the league,
I could really use your help

11:30.951 --> 11:32.735
with these upcoming
CBA negotiations.

11:32.779 --> 11:34.998
Hell yeah, dawg,
count me all the way in.

11:35.042 --> 11:37.218
At least somebody value
my opinion around here.

11:37.261 --> 11:40.264
Thank you, my brother.
Jason, sorry I missed you

11:40.308 --> 11:42.702
-at Judd Cole's pro day.
-Who, me?

11:42.745 --> 11:44.704
Nah, I don't--
I don't do pro days.

11:44.747 --> 11:48.098
-But--
-Good talk, Chance, be gone.

11:48.142 --> 11:49.926
-Sorry, but--
-Be gone.

11:53.843 --> 11:56.106
Judd Cole?

11:56.150 --> 11:58.761
Why the hell are we looking
at a quarterback, Jason?

11:58.805 --> 12:00.763
-Hey-- hey-- hey--
-Hey-- hey-- hey--

12:00.807 --> 12:02.330
Hey-- hey!

12:02.373 --> 12:04.985
You said this was
your last deal, right?

12:05.028 --> 12:06.595
So you sign a two-year
contract,

12:06.638 --> 12:08.075
the kid learns
under the best, it's a win-win!

12:08.118 --> 12:09.511
Two years? Man, that's
some bullshit, dawg.

12:09.554 --> 12:10.904
Look, if it was

12:10.947 --> 12:12.470
my call, I'd have you
around forever, you're--

12:12.514 --> 12:14.255
you're like my work wife.
You put rings on it, bro.

12:14.298 --> 12:15.952
For me,
it's till death do us part.

12:15.996 --> 12:17.998
Or you retire,
or you get traded,

12:18.041 --> 12:19.782
-or you get fat--
-You know what, I'm about

12:19.826 --> 12:21.610
to walk away from you, because
I'm starting to feel like

12:21.653 --> 12:23.481
-I'm getting played.
-You could get hurt.

12:23.525 --> 12:24.874
You could start popping pills
again, drinking, we don't know

12:24.918 --> 12:26.310
-what's gonna happen.
-Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

12:26.354 --> 12:28.225
Garret Evans.

12:30.271 --> 12:32.012
Rick.

12:32.055 --> 12:33.622
Let me introduce you
to Tasha Mack.

12:33.665 --> 12:35.319
One of the best agents I know.

12:35.363 --> 12:36.756
Oh, it's an honor,
Ms. Mack.

12:36.799 --> 12:39.193
Call me Tasha,
all my clients do.

12:39.236 --> 12:41.586
Mama, yo, I need you

12:41.630 --> 12:43.588
to get me out of San Diego,
and I mean right now.

12:43.632 --> 12:45.199
Except for my son,
who doesn't care

12:45.242 --> 12:48.115
when I'm working.
Malik, this is Garret Evans.

12:48.158 --> 12:49.769
-Oh, I know.
-My man.

12:49.812 --> 12:52.380
Malik, go and get
one of those corndog...

12:52.423 --> 12:54.469
stick thingies while Tasha
and Garret get acquainted.

12:54.512 --> 12:56.384
Oh, yeah.
They're delicious-- oh!

12:56.427 --> 12:59.256
Oh, Mama, I mean it,
I want out of San Diego now.

12:59.300 --> 13:01.606
-Please.
-Okay, Malik, damn.

13:01.650 --> 13:03.478
Kids.
[laughing]

13:03.521 --> 13:05.915
So, how does it feel
knowing you're about to be

13:05.959 --> 13:07.961
-a top ten pick?
-Oh, that's very kind of you,

13:08.004 --> 13:09.963
but I'm not projected
to go top ten.

13:10.006 --> 13:11.703
Well, I've never
been your agent.

13:11.747 --> 13:14.837
When Mama gets a feelin',
Mama's never wrong.

13:14.881 --> 13:16.839
Apologies for my tardiness,

13:16.883 --> 13:19.146
but the St. Louis Airport
is very lacking.

13:19.189 --> 13:21.670
-Oh.
-Ms. Mack, this is

13:21.713 --> 13:24.804
Nelson Evans, my father.
Dad, this is Miss...

13:24.847 --> 13:27.545
Latasha Sojourner Mack,

13:27.589 --> 13:30.157
soon to be the owner
of The Rick Fox Agency.

13:30.200 --> 13:33.551
Ooh, look at that.
Worldwide known.

13:33.595 --> 13:35.640
[laughing]
Listen, Mr. Evans,

13:35.684 --> 13:37.468
I was just telling Garret
how excited I am

13:37.512 --> 13:39.862
-to represent him.
-Yes...

13:39.906 --> 13:42.430
I assume
that will be problematic

13:42.473 --> 13:44.301
since you're not
a real agent?

13:44.345 --> 13:46.390
Well, I would think
that my clients

13:46.434 --> 13:48.175
as well as my bank account
would disagree.

13:48.218 --> 13:50.699
What I mean is you're not
certified-- thus, not real.

13:50.742 --> 13:52.527
An ostrich with a mane
is not a lion.

13:52.570 --> 13:54.398
What the hell
you just call me?

13:54.442 --> 13:57.837
It's a proverb,
Ms. Mack, it's his thing.

13:57.880 --> 14:00.709
Dad, what is this?

14:00.752 --> 14:03.103
It's important
that everyone know facts

14:03.146 --> 14:05.018
before making decisions.

14:06.019 --> 14:07.890
-What the hell is this?
-It's a background check,

14:07.934 --> 14:10.501
and list of certified agents
which you will need to be

14:10.545 --> 14:13.722
in order to negotiate
on behalf of my son.

14:13.765 --> 14:15.985
[laughing]
This...

14:16.029 --> 14:17.639
this some fake news.

14:17.682 --> 14:20.468
This news is
most certainly real.

14:20.511 --> 14:23.253
My people are thorough.
So when you're certified,

14:23.297 --> 14:25.081
we can talk about you
representing my son.

14:25.125 --> 14:27.605
Mr. Evans,
today is not about me.

14:27.649 --> 14:29.564
-Okay? It's about Garret.
-Mm.

14:29.607 --> 14:32.349
But I can guarantee you
that, as his agent,

14:32.393 --> 14:35.135
he'll be the first
defensive player off that board.

14:36.658 --> 14:39.052
Ms. Mack,
will you excuse us?

14:39.095 --> 14:41.228
My father and I have
a lot to discuss.

14:50.541 --> 14:52.021
Asshole.

14:55.677 --> 14:57.505
You wanted to help me,
but why embarrass

14:57.548 --> 14:59.289
Ms. Mack in that way?

14:59.333 --> 15:01.378
It's better to know the truth
than to live a lie.

15:01.422 --> 15:02.902
Besides, she'll be fine.

15:02.945 --> 15:04.425
Skin is thicker
than a rhino's ass.

15:04.468 --> 15:05.905
Would you make up your mind?

15:05.948 --> 15:07.645
Is she an ostrich
or a rhino?

15:07.689 --> 15:09.821
Look, I don't know
how the hell this happened,

15:09.865 --> 15:11.954
but you gotta fix it
before it leaks.

15:15.044 --> 15:16.524
Fixing it.

15:16.567 --> 15:18.091
Hey, Tash, heads up,

15:18.134 --> 15:19.614
Malik found out
about the Sabers offer.

15:19.657 --> 15:22.356
-I know.
-Got a weird feeling, you know?

15:22.399 --> 15:24.227
Could be indigestion,
I don't know, I--

15:24.271 --> 15:26.882
-I had vegan Thai for lunch.
-Look, not now, Jason.

15:26.926 --> 15:29.319
Tasha, you're not certified
because you didn't graduate

15:29.363 --> 15:31.191
-from high school?
-[laughing]

15:31.234 --> 15:32.801
-How the hell did this happen?
-I don't know.

15:32.844 --> 15:34.324
Irv said that it was handled.

15:34.368 --> 15:36.022
You left it up
to douchebag Irv?

15:36.065 --> 15:37.893
Hey, hey, Irv might
be a douchebag,

15:37.937 --> 15:40.200
but he's my douchebag, you show
some damn respect, Foxy.

15:40.243 --> 15:41.897
What is this?

15:41.941 --> 15:43.638
Are you the son
I groomed to run an empire

15:43.681 --> 15:45.683
or a rastafarian?

15:46.728 --> 15:48.991
You could've been a barrister
like your brother,

15:49.035 --> 15:50.732
or a neurosurgeon
like your sister,

15:50.775 --> 15:52.952
-but no, you--
-Not this again.

15:52.995 --> 15:54.910
So you want your sister
to examine your brain

15:54.954 --> 15:56.738
for CTE once you die?

15:56.781 --> 15:58.958
Would you listen to yourself?
You sound ridiculous.

15:59.001 --> 16:01.699
Yes, and you're a fool.
Lord knows we don't need money,

16:01.743 --> 16:07.183
but you love the game, right?

16:07.227 --> 16:08.968
Well, if so then why hand
your career over to a woman

16:09.011 --> 16:11.013
who can't even get a GED?

16:13.015 --> 16:15.148
Is it too much
to ask for one day?

16:15.191 --> 16:18.107
Huh, Dad?
I'm being drafted.

16:18.151 --> 16:22.024
And if you can't be here for me,
then... just leave.

16:24.026 --> 16:25.985
-Tasha, I trusted you.
-Okay...

16:26.028 --> 16:27.551
Tasha, my clients trust me.

16:27.595 --> 16:28.944
-Okay.
-Tasha--

16:28.988 --> 16:30.467
Look, Rick,
I'm gonna fix it.

16:30.511 --> 16:33.035
Okay? I'm gonna make it
right, I promise.

16:33.079 --> 16:35.385
Okay, before the draft starts,

16:35.429 --> 16:37.561
or the deal's off,
and I'm up shit's creek

16:37.605 --> 16:40.477
-without a row-y thingy.
-An oar.

16:40.521 --> 16:42.958
Paddle. The word he couldn't
think of is "paddle."

16:43.002 --> 16:44.873
Hey, while I have you,

16:44.916 --> 16:46.266
I just wanna run
some numbers by you

16:46.309 --> 16:48.355
about Malik's deal, okay?

16:48.398 --> 16:52.837
So, we got one plus one
equals you don't know

16:52.881 --> 16:54.578
because you didn't
graduate high school.

16:54.622 --> 16:56.232
Asshole.

16:56.276 --> 16:57.886
You got your middle school
diploma, right?

16:57.929 --> 16:59.366
Yeah, whatever, fuck you.

16:59.409 --> 17:01.281
[sighing]
Look,

17:01.324 --> 17:03.065
oh, God, there's no way
I'm gonna get certified

17:03.109 --> 17:05.067
in three hours, okay,

17:05.111 --> 17:06.982
dirty tricks got me here.

17:07.026 --> 17:08.766
Maybe they'll save me.

17:08.810 --> 17:10.638
I want intimate details
on every team owner,

17:10.681 --> 17:13.423
-and I want 'em now.
-I'm on it.

17:13.467 --> 17:17.253
We are back in St. Louis
at the 2017 pro football draft,

17:17.297 --> 17:19.864
and we're following
a number of breaking stories,

17:19.908 --> 17:21.562
-including the...
-So, now your son

17:21.605 --> 17:23.085
was prom king last night.

17:23.129 --> 17:25.740
It was kind of nice.

17:25.783 --> 17:28.830
She's right.
You should go.

17:28.873 --> 17:30.701
But not with her.

17:30.745 --> 17:32.703
You need to leave
that girl alone.

17:32.747 --> 17:35.837
Mommy,
I am not leaving Allison.

17:35.880 --> 17:38.492
So can we just enjoy
the draft party?

17:38.535 --> 17:41.364
Hmm? Can we do that?

17:41.408 --> 17:43.758
-[sighing]
-Oh, you cute.

17:43.801 --> 17:45.281
This isn't a joke.

17:45.325 --> 17:47.153
You done
with high school ball,

17:47.196 --> 17:49.807
so them white folks,
they done with you.

17:49.851 --> 17:52.810
Now, once you get to campus,
they can protect you.

17:52.854 --> 17:54.899
Okay, so what do you
want me to do, huh, Mom?

17:54.943 --> 17:56.814
Just up and leave?

17:56.858 --> 17:59.339
You just got clean.
You need me here.

17:59.382 --> 18:02.385
What I need you to do...

18:02.429 --> 18:03.995
is pack your bags

18:04.039 --> 18:06.911
and head to Tuscaloosa
right now.

18:06.955 --> 18:09.088
Okay, Mom...

18:09.131 --> 18:11.525
I don't need to run.

18:13.266 --> 18:15.268
We didn't do anything wrong.

18:15.311 --> 18:17.487
We rarely do, baby.

18:17.531 --> 18:19.968
And it never seems to matter.

18:23.624 --> 18:26.235
♪

18:26.279 --> 18:28.759
I don't know what the hell
I'm looking for,

18:28.803 --> 18:32.111

to a jet is Jet Magazine.

18:45.211 --> 18:47.474
At least you get the centerfold.

18:47.517 --> 18:50.216
I used to love those
in college.

Yo... you think
your pops can get us

19:06.667 --> 19:09.148

19:09.191 --> 19:11.193
-I love him.
-Oh, my gosh, A,

19:11.237 --> 19:12.890
we're not friends,
we never will be,

19:12.934 --> 19:14.849

B, here.

How'd you get this?

19:18.679 --> 19:20.594
-I stole it.
-With enemies like you,

19:20.637 --> 19:22.335
-who needs friends?
-It's to hype up

19:22.378 --> 19:24.119

because I just landed

19:24.163 --> 19:26.165

to replace my dad.

19:26.208 --> 19:29.255
-Oh, really, who?
-Dominique Wilkins!

19:29.298 --> 19:30.908
-Oh, my God.
-Xavier, I didn't know

19:30.952 --> 19:33.172
-you two had met.
-We just did.

19:33.215 --> 19:35.391
This vodka is gonna be huge.

19:35.435 --> 19:37.219
X, see you
at the after party.

19:37.263 --> 19:39.090

the after party, shots on me.

Oh, we did it!

19:51.407 --> 19:53.670
-I am so relieved.
-No, I did.

19:53.714 --> 19:57.326
And I had to triple his fee,
so... you're out.

19:57.370 --> 20:00.764
[scoffs] That's bullshit, X.

20:00.808 --> 20:02.505
You wouldn't have
Dominique Wilkins

20:02.549 --> 20:04.377
if it wasn't for me,
and I will sue your ass.

20:04.420 --> 20:06.248
That's fine by me.
Just make sure

20:06.292 --> 20:09.947
you show the judge the contract
that you never signed.

20:09.991 --> 20:13.168
-You wouldn't.
-I think I just did.

20:14.517 --> 20:16.215
Come on, Raq,
we got vodka to sell.

20:16.258 --> 20:18.913
Nah, listen, I'm no fan
of Little Miss Rich Girl,

20:18.956 --> 20:20.480

panties, Raq.

20:22.569 --> 20:24.875
-This is real life.
-You keep talking like that,

20:24.919 --> 20:27.443
you ain't never getting up
in these panties again.

20:27.487 --> 20:30.533
Hold up, wait, I'm sorry--
you're sleeping with him, too?

20:30.577 --> 20:32.622
Wait, hold up, you?

20:38.454 --> 20:40.064

20:40.108 --> 20:43.024
You're both fired.
I'll take that.

you have access
to his passwords.

20:52.163 --> 20:53.687
You ran his social media, right?

20:53.730 --> 20:55.515
Yeah, so?

20:55.558 --> 20:58.300
So, if we work together,

to beat this creep

Hey, I see
you got my note, huh?

21:16.449 --> 21:20.191
Not many people know
my nickname.

21:20.235 --> 21:22.281
Well, that's what happens
when you're born on Easter,

21:22.324 --> 21:24.370
-Mr. Cottontail.
-Ms. Mack,

21:24.413 --> 21:26.415
you've obviously done
your homework,

21:26.459 --> 21:28.025
and I'm obviously busy.

21:28.069 --> 21:31.333
-What can I do you for?
-Well, homework

21:31.377 --> 21:33.553
is something that
we both have in common.

21:33.596 --> 21:36.295
Neither of us did much,
since we both quit high school.

21:37.992 --> 21:39.907
-Yes, I did.
-Mm-hmm.

21:39.950 --> 21:41.474
Life got in the way.

21:41.517 --> 21:43.258
Yeah, well, for me
it was a nine-pound,

21:43.302 --> 21:45.086
six-ounce bundle of joy

21:45.129 --> 21:47.958
who I now represent
as the top QB in your league.

21:48.002 --> 21:50.874
But in about an hour,
all of that can change,

21:50.918 --> 21:53.747
because of you
and 31 of your best friends.

21:53.790 --> 21:56.924
Forgive me,
but I'm completely lost.

21:56.967 --> 22:00.057
You see, you can be
an owner without a diploma,

22:00.101 --> 22:02.495
but I can't be
an agent without one.

22:02.538 --> 22:04.453
Y'all made that rule,

22:04.497 --> 22:06.237
and it sucks worse
than a ho on heroin.

22:06.281 --> 22:08.544
Ha! You...

22:08.588 --> 22:11.242
you remind me of Sarah,
my third wife.

22:11.286 --> 22:14.420
Oh, was she
a hardworking genius, too?

22:14.463 --> 22:17.379
Not quite the resemblance
I had in mind.

22:17.423 --> 22:20.991
Ah, yeah, I heard you like
dipping into the chocolate.

22:23.037 --> 22:25.387
Let's keep it cool, Colonel.

22:25.431 --> 22:27.911
I'll try.

22:27.955 --> 22:31.088
What exactly is it
you're asking of me, Ms. Mack?

22:31.132 --> 22:35.310
Being an agent gave me
purpose, an identity.

22:35.354 --> 22:38.574
It... made me
a halfway decent mom.

22:38.618 --> 22:41.142
So I'm asking you...

22:41.185 --> 22:43.623
not to take that
away from me.

the past in the past, Tee Tee.

29:02.175 --> 29:04.743
All right, Mama, Sabers
about to make their select.

29:04.786 --> 29:07.223
-Where my trade at?
-Just watch, baby.

29:07.267 --> 29:10.139
ANNOUNCER: San Diego has traded
the fifth pick to St. Louis.

29:10.183 --> 29:12.489
Sir, I love Allison.

29:12.533 --> 29:15.971
And I have the utmost respect
for you and Ms. Morris.

29:16.015 --> 29:19.148
Um, we were just two kids
who wanted to go to prom,

29:19.192 --> 29:21.063
but unfortunately
we did it the wrong way,

29:21.107 --> 29:23.762
and for that,
I am very sorry.

29:23.805 --> 29:26.025
If you respected us,

29:26.068 --> 29:28.244
you wouldn't have taken
Allison's virginity

29:28.288 --> 29:30.203
in the hotel room.

29:30.246 --> 29:32.292
That's what happened, right?

29:32.335 --> 29:35.121
You made my little girl
a woman last night?

29:35.164 --> 29:37.645
Uh...

29:37.688 --> 29:39.865
it-- it wasn't like that.

29:39.908 --> 29:43.085
Did you or did you not sleep
with my daughter?

29:46.001 --> 29:48.699
Yes, I did, but...

29:48.743 --> 29:50.223
like I said, we're in love.

29:50.266 --> 29:51.833
-In love?
-Yes.

29:51.877 --> 29:53.792
-You're a teenager.
-Yes.

29:53.835 --> 29:55.837
And once I'm drafted,
I give you my word,

29:55.881 --> 29:58.753
I'll-- I'll take care of her,
I'll marry her.

29:58.797 --> 30:00.711
I'll-- I'll give her
the world.

30:00.755 --> 30:02.888
Thank you, Jamison.

30:02.931 --> 30:05.586
It took guts coming here.

30:05.629 --> 30:07.849
-Yeah.
-And with the fifth pick

30:07.893 --> 30:10.547
of the 2017
pro football draft,

30:10.591 --> 30:14.290
the St. Louis Fighting Fury
select Garret Evans,

30:14.334 --> 30:16.640
defensive back.

30:16.684 --> 30:19.730
[cheering and applause]

30:21.036 --> 30:23.430
-Mom, what's going on?
-Ms. Mack worked her magic.

30:23.473 --> 30:25.475
She got St. Louis
and San Diego to make a deal.

30:25.519 --> 30:28.130
-What?
-Sabers stepped up, baby.

30:28.174 --> 30:30.698
Four years,
$100 million.

30:30.741 --> 30:33.179
-Fully guaranteed.
-Fully guaranteed?

30:33.222 --> 30:35.790
-Whoo!
-Every damn dime!

30:35.834 --> 30:38.010
Happy for you.
It's your hometown.

30:38.053 --> 30:39.750
These are the fans
you're gonna be playing for.

30:39.794 --> 30:43.798
-Hold the shirt up.
-Hey! We're doing it!

30:43.842 --> 30:46.670
But you know,
that little girl upstairs,

30:46.714 --> 30:48.368
that's my life,

30:48.411 --> 30:50.326
and it's my job to protect her.

30:53.634 --> 30:56.942
Which is why you will
never see Allison again.

30:56.985 --> 30:58.726
Gentlemen?

31:00.162 --> 31:03.383
By the way...
thanks for the confession.

31:03.426 --> 31:06.038
-Confession?
-Jamison Fields, you're under

31:06.081 --> 31:07.909
-arrest for statutory rape.
-Rape?

31:07.953 --> 31:09.911
You have the right
to remain silent.

31:09.955 --> 31:11.870
-Rape? What do you mean "rape"?
-Anything you say can and will

31:11.913 --> 31:13.567
-be used against you--
-Hold on, hold on... listen,

31:13.610 --> 31:15.482
Mr. Morris,
I didn't rape Allison!

31:15.525 --> 31:17.745
I didn't rape Allison, that's
my girlfriend, I love her!

31:17.788 --> 31:19.790
-You understand these rights?
-No, I don't understand--

31:19.834 --> 31:21.749
I didn't rape-- no-no-no,
I didn't rape her!

31:21.792 --> 31:23.794
-Don't make this worse.
-What're you talking about?

31:23.838 --> 31:25.709
-I didn't rape her!
-Jamison?

31:25.753 --> 31:27.450
Allison, Allison,
they're saying that I--

31:27.494 --> 31:29.322
Jamison-- please, stop,
what did you do?

31:29.365 --> 31:31.759
-Let him go, please!
-I didn't rape you, Allison!

31:31.802 --> 31:33.935
He didn't do anything!
He didn't do anything!

31:33.979 --> 31:35.937
-I told you nothing happened.
-Calm down, calm down.

31:35.981 --> 31:39.201
-Fuck you!
-Allison?

31:39.245 --> 31:41.377
[laughing]

31:41.421 --> 31:43.031
Billionaire Boys' Club,
here I come, baby!

31:43.075 --> 31:44.641
-Whoo!
-Whoo!

31:44.685 --> 31:46.252
You know what
I'm gonna do to celebrate?

31:46.295 --> 31:47.775
Tonight, I'm gonna have sex

31:47.818 --> 31:49.385
with a record five women.

31:49.429 --> 31:51.039
And I'm gonna
let you watch, Tee Tee.

31:51.083 --> 31:52.911
-Oh, God.
-Come on, Malik.

31:52.954 --> 31:54.825
I got a baby on the way.

31:54.869 --> 31:57.524
You know I can't engage
in such acts.

31:57.567 --> 31:59.526
-Unless I can record it.
-Well, get your camera

31:59.569 --> 32:01.223
with your slow ass.
Come on, baby!

32:01.267 --> 32:03.660
That's nasty, okay?
You wrap up my investment.

32:03.704 --> 32:05.271
Well, you know,
maybe, maybe not.

32:05.314 --> 32:06.837
-Wrap it up.
-Bring you some grandkids

32:06.881 --> 32:08.274
home, Mama...
[laughing]

32:08.317 --> 32:09.928
I just can't quit you.

32:09.971 --> 32:12.626
-I can't do it.
-My man.

32:12.669 --> 32:14.149
Today! Hey,
I'm proud of you, brother.

32:14.193 --> 32:16.064
-Thank you, brother.
-Big ups, Lik.

32:16.108 --> 32:18.545
That new deal makes you
even more powerful to the union.

32:18.588 --> 32:21.156
Yeah, my man, and, uh...
speaking of that,

32:21.200 --> 32:23.506
I'm-a have to play it smart
with this new deal.

32:23.550 --> 32:25.856
Uh, okay, I don't get it.

32:25.900 --> 32:27.641
I just did my part
for the union by getting

32:27.684 --> 32:30.035
Malik's first
fully guaranteed contract.

32:30.078 --> 32:32.776
Yes, but that's not enough.

32:33.995 --> 32:35.954
Look, the owners are unified.

32:35.997 --> 32:37.607
We need you, Lik.

32:37.651 --> 32:40.175
To whom much is given,
much is required.

32:40.219 --> 32:42.438
Oh... yeah, I got
that fortune cookie once too,

32:42.482 --> 32:46.051
but dawg, for right now,
Malik's looking out for Malik.

32:46.094 --> 32:47.748
Deuces.
[laughing]

32:47.791 --> 32:49.489
Whoo!

32:49.532 --> 32:53.188
-Aah! That's right, my nigga!
-I told you!

32:53.232 --> 32:55.756
When Mama got a feeling,
you'd better listen.

32:55.799 --> 32:57.932
Fifth overall? Come on.

32:57.976 --> 32:59.586
You certainly know this game.

32:59.629 --> 33:01.066
Oh, yeah, look,
this is just the beginning.

33:01.109 --> 33:02.589
I got endorsements lined up

33:02.632 --> 33:04.765
that're gonna blow
your bloody mind.

33:05.896 --> 33:08.464
Actually, Ms. Mack,
I'm going with another agent.

33:08.508 --> 33:11.163
I'm sorry, I got bad hearing,
it sounded to me like,

33:11.206 --> 33:12.991
after I done moved mountains

33:13.034 --> 33:15.558
for you and your rude-ass
father, you're shitting on me.

33:15.602 --> 33:17.647
Yes, my father is rude.

33:17.691 --> 33:20.085
But his methods work.

33:20.128 --> 33:22.565
I need an agent
with all their ducks in a row,

33:22.609 --> 33:24.132
and sadly that's not you.

33:24.176 --> 33:25.786
Ladies.

33:25.829 --> 33:28.919
Oh... you and your daddy
call me one more animal,

33:28.963 --> 33:31.748
oh, we gonna have a problem,
Lenny Kravitz.

33:33.098 --> 33:35.883
-You good?
-Yeah.

33:35.926 --> 33:38.059
Just the life of an agent.

33:38.103 --> 33:41.715
In honor of a deal
that's officially closed,

33:41.758 --> 33:43.673
to the new owner
of The Rick Fox Agency.

33:43.717 --> 33:46.763
Yes, the Tasha Mack Mega-Agency.

33:46.807 --> 33:49.679
Pow-pow,
motherfuckin' pow.

33:52.726 --> 33:54.989
Mmm.

33:55.033 --> 33:57.470
I'm gonna miss you,
Tasha Mack.

33:57.513 --> 34:00.429
It's the cooch, Rick.
Sucks you in.

34:00.473 --> 34:01.822
Never lets go.

34:01.865 --> 34:03.650
Take care of yourself.

34:03.693 --> 34:05.913
Yeah-- mm.

34:05.956 --> 34:07.480
Take care of my agency.

34:07.523 --> 34:09.264
This is my legacy.

34:09.308 --> 34:11.571
They'd have to pry it away
from my cold, dead hands

34:11.614 --> 34:13.399
