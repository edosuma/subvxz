WEBVTT

00:23.356 --> 00:27.610
My husband and I worked
for everything I had.

00:27.694 --> 00:29.154
Don't come near me!

00:29.237 --> 00:30.739
Okay, okay.

00:31.489 --> 00:33.450
Okay. Hey, you don't wanna do this.

00:33.533 --> 00:36.703
I don't know how I could be so stupid!

00:36.786 --> 00:39.039
Hey, hold on a second.
Give me your hand.

00:39.122 --> 00:43.126
I have nothing! Nothing!

00:43.209 --> 00:44.711
Sure, you do.

00:44.794 --> 00:46.755
Mrs. Feldman,
how about you take a step towards me?

00:46.838 --> 00:48.673
-We'll go inside and talk.

00:48.757 --> 00:51.342
I need a Crisis Response Unit here
right now.

00:51.426 --> 00:54.429
Get that chopper out of here!
No, no, no, no!

01:37.514 --> 01:38.765
Mmm.

01:41.976 --> 01:42.811
Hey, bear.

01:42.894 --> 01:43.895
Hey, baby.

01:45.021 --> 01:45.897
You gotta get up.

01:46.648 --> 01:48.441
<i> </i> I know.

01:50.527 --> 01:51.611
Is that rain?

01:52.278 --> 01:54.030
Yeah, it stopped about an hour ago.

01:55.573 --> 01:58.159
I left the keys on the table for you,
by the way.

01:59.369 --> 02:00.787
Baby, it's Tuesday.

02:00.870 --> 02:03.414
You take your mom to the grocery store
on Tuesdays.

02:03.498 --> 02:04.791
Nah, it's...

02:04.874 --> 02:07.877
...it's fine. I told her
I'd come by later tonight, and...

02:08.586 --> 02:09.753
I just need to stay in.

02:12.799 --> 02:13.633
Are you okay?

02:14.425 --> 02:15.260
-Yeah.
-What's wrong?

02:15.343 --> 02:17.387
No, no, nothing. Nothing's wrong.

02:17.804 --> 02:18.805
Nothing's wrong.

02:19.264 --> 02:20.098
Take the car.

02:20.849 --> 02:21.766
Now, get up.

02:24.185 --> 02:27.147
Okay, well, you'll tell me later,
like you always do.

02:27.856 --> 02:28.898
I'll wait.

02:31.025 --> 02:32.402
-All right?
-Okay.

03:02.557 --> 03:05.059
<i> Now we're going</i>
<i>to move over to the Grace Waters case.</i>

03:05.143 --> 03:06.352
<i>Everyone's talking about it.</i>

03:06.436 --> 03:08.938
<i>The woman killed her husband, allegedly.</i>

03:09.022 --> 03:12.609
<i>Hold on, now.</i>
<i>Yes, we must say "allegedly."</i>

03:15.653 --> 03:18.072
<i>We have a population</i>
<i>of less than 100,000.</i>

03:18.156 --> 03:19.991
<i>Nothing like this</i>
<i>has ever happened before--</i>

03:20.074 --> 03:22.410
<i>But have you seen the reports from the DA?</i>

03:22.493 --> 03:24.746
<i>It's clear. She totally did it.</i>

03:33.254 --> 03:34.172
Jasmine.

03:35.381 --> 03:37.133
Coming.

03:44.515 --> 03:45.934
Here. Your next case.

03:47.894 --> 03:49.729
Grace Waters? I can't do this.

03:49.812 --> 03:51.272
Yeah, you can, and you will.

03:51.356 --> 03:53.775
She wants to plead guilty,
so this is completely easy.

03:53.858 --> 03:56.527
Go talk to her, talk to the DA,
get it worked out,

03:56.611 --> 03:58.738
get the plea done.
It's really high-profile,

03:58.821 --> 04:00.198
and we don't need it mishandled
or going to trial.

04:00.281 --> 04:02.033
What about giving it to Tilsa or Donnie?

04:02.116 --> 04:03.493
I mean, they are more...

04:03.576 --> 04:05.453
-...equipped to do this--
-You are doing it.

04:05.536 --> 04:06.829
We go through this all the time.

04:06.913 --> 04:08.706
You <i>can </i> do it.
Plea deals are your specialty.

04:08.790 --> 04:09.999
She's adamant about pleading guilty.

04:10.083 --> 04:12.252
There's an overwhelming mountain
of evidence against her.

04:12.335 --> 04:14.462
This is open-and-shut.
Just go get it done.

04:14.545 --> 04:16.798
I want it done this week
so this media circus will go away.

04:16.880 --> 04:18.257
-Thank you.
-But, Rory, I...

04:19.509 --> 04:20.426
Go.

04:22.178 --> 04:23.012
Okay.

04:26.015 --> 04:27.267
Can you believe this?

04:27.892 --> 04:31.104
Ah! Congratulations, girl.
You know we all wanted it.

04:31.187 --> 04:33.940
I cannot believe he gave it to you.

04:34.399 --> 04:35.942
Donnie, shut the hell up.

04:36.025 --> 04:38.319
-I don't understand.
-But who asked you? It's not the time.

04:38.403 --> 04:39.988
This is nothing to celebrate, Tilsa.

04:40.071 --> 04:41.656
Look, it's a big case,

04:41.990 --> 04:45.118
but you have a great relationship
with the DA, right?

04:45.201 --> 04:46.995
So maybe that's in her best interest.

04:48.037 --> 04:48.997
Great.

04:49.080 --> 04:51.541
I have a great relationship with the DA.

04:51.624 --> 04:52.583
That's awesome.

04:55.086 --> 04:57.213
<i>Either way, it's really sad. Look around.</i>

04:57.297 --> 05:00.341
<i>And I don't see any way out of it.</i>
<i>If you ask me, it's getting worse.</i>

05:00.425 --> 05:02.635
<i>I can tell you,</i>
<i>without a doubt, the whole town's talking.</i>

05:02.719 --> 05:04.429
<i>This morning, while I was getting coffee,</i>

05:04.512 --> 05:07.390
<i>two or three conversations,</i>
<i>all about the Grace Waters case.</i>

05:07.932 --> 05:10.226
<i>Well, that's interesting.</i>
<i>How about our next caller?</i>

05:10.310 --> 05:12.478
<i> I mean,</i>
<i>I feel like she's totally guilty.</i>

05:12.562 --> 05:15.273
<i>I don't even know</i>
<i>why we are wasting money with a trial.</i>

05:15.356 --> 05:17.734
<i>Just tie her up to an electric chair,</i>
<i>and hit the switch.</i>

05:17.817 --> 05:19.569
<i>Boom! Problem solved.</i>

05:31.205 --> 05:33.541
We're outside
the Holloway Correctional Facility,

05:33.624 --> 05:35.585
where Grace Waters is being held.

05:35.668 --> 05:37.628
She's scheduled for court in three days.

05:37.712 --> 05:41.382
As many of you know, she's been accused
of murdering her husband.

05:47.138 --> 05:49.640
Hi, I'm Jasmine Bryant
from the public defender's office.

05:49.724 --> 05:51.267
I'm here for Grace Waters.

05:51.351 --> 05:53.144
Yes, ma'am.
Step through here for me, please.

05:56.731 --> 05:58.399
And just put your bag on the table for me.

05:58.483 --> 05:59.317
Okay.

06:04.197 --> 06:05.156
-All right.
-Okay.

06:17.835 --> 06:21.297
Just have a seat,
and I will be right back with her.

06:21.381 --> 06:22.632
-E-Excuse me.

06:22.715 --> 06:25.009
- Yes?
-Um, is there anything I should know?

06:25.093 --> 06:26.469
Is this your first murderer?

06:26.969 --> 06:28.012
Yeah.

06:28.096 --> 06:30.640
You don't have anything to worry about.
She'll be shackled.

07:23.151 --> 07:24.861
Put your hands on the desk for me.

07:37.331 --> 07:40.543
I'm your attorney, Jasmine Bryant.

07:41.043 --> 07:44.547
I'm from the public defender's office.
I was appointed by the court.

07:46.132 --> 07:48.009
I told them I didn't want a lawyer.

07:48.509 --> 07:51.554
Well, if not me,
then some other lawyer will be here.

07:51.637 --> 07:53.764
The judge was very clear on that.

07:54.849 --> 07:57.226
So, I understand
that you want to plead guilty?

08:00.354 --> 08:01.606
How old are you?

08:03.441 --> 08:04.400
Twenty-six.

08:06.402 --> 08:08.571
What school did you go to?

08:09.280 --> 08:10.198
Ruston.

08:10.698 --> 08:12.617
Community college.

08:14.035 --> 08:16.078
And then I went on to Baniview Law.

08:18.789 --> 08:20.291
Your file... um...

08:20.750 --> 08:23.211
I had a chance to glance at it
on my way over here,

08:23.294 --> 08:26.506
and, um, I'm a little confused.
You worked at a bank,

08:26.589 --> 08:29.800
you've never even had a traffic violation,
and now you're here.

08:30.676 --> 08:34.054
I'm gonna ask the DA for 15 years
with the possibility of parole.

08:34.263 --> 08:36.265
I may be able to sell that to him.

08:37.517 --> 08:38.601
You're Catholic.

08:39.477 --> 08:41.812
-Yes.
- That wasn't a question.

08:42.270 --> 08:43.397
I see the rosary.

08:47.527 --> 08:48.444
Are you Catholic?

08:48.945 --> 08:50.363
<i>In the name of the Father,</i>

08:50.446 --> 08:51.447
and the Son,

08:51.531 --> 08:53.449
<i>and the Holy Spirit...</i>

08:53.533 --> 08:55.159
So, you pray the rosary?

08:57.078 --> 08:57.912
Yes.

09:01.123 --> 09:03.584
I want to move to a prison close to here.

09:05.253 --> 09:08.631
I want to be able to see my son
and my grandbaby...

09:09.549 --> 09:10.675
at some point.

09:12.134 --> 09:13.135
And I want that

09:13.803 --> 09:15.096
in the plea deal.

09:17.932 --> 09:19.517
Okay. I'll see what I can do.

09:21.561 --> 09:22.478
Guard!

09:24.730 --> 09:26.691
<i> Okay. So what was she like?</i>

09:26.774 --> 09:29.360
<i>Well,</i>
<i>it was nothing like I expected.</i>

09:29.569 --> 09:32.655
<i>She was like my mom, and yours.</i>
<i>She was...</i>

09:33.239 --> 09:34.073
gentle.

09:34.156 --> 09:35.700
- Hmm. Mm.
- Gentle.

09:35.783 --> 09:37.868
You know, but, at first glance...

09:40.037 --> 09:42.331
she appears to be
a picture-perfect defendant.

09:42.415 --> 09:44.041
She baked cookies for kids,

09:44.125 --> 09:47.336
she sang in a church choir,
she taught Sunday school.

09:48.045 --> 09:51.007
There's a lot of good things here
for you to build a solid defense.

09:51.090 --> 09:52.675
The evidence against her is overwhelming.

09:52.758 --> 09:55.052
But beyond a reasonable doubt?
It was circumstantial.

09:56.554 --> 09:59.140
She confessed she did it.
She wants to plead guilty.

09:59.849 --> 10:01.642
- I mean...

10:01.726 --> 10:03.102
-This--
- Donnie, just chill.

10:03.185 --> 10:04.937
No, no, no. No, no.

10:05.021 --> 10:06.939
-What, Donnie?

10:07.023 --> 10:10.026
I-I-I'm not trying to take away
from your remarkable ability

10:10.109 --> 10:11.110
as a public defender,

10:11.193 --> 10:14.071
um, but they gave you this case
because they want you to plead it,

10:14.155 --> 10:15.031
be done with it,

10:15.114 --> 10:17.992
as to not embarrass
the public defender's office.

10:18.075 --> 10:20.995
But how embarrassing would it be,
due to the high profile of this case,

10:21.078 --> 10:22.413
if you were missing something?

10:22.496 --> 10:23.998
What could I be missing, Donnie?

10:24.081 --> 10:26.626
Okay, like she said, okay,
what could she be missing?

10:26.709 --> 10:28.002
The woman confessed, right?

10:28.085 --> 10:30.755
-Exactly.
- Please don't encourage her.

10:30.838 --> 10:32.381
Did she confess to you?

10:32.965 --> 10:35.426
-No, she told the officers that she--
-Ah. You see?

10:35.509 --> 10:37.511
You see? This is what I'm talkin' about.

10:37.595 --> 10:40.306
You can't just plea her down
without knowing all of the facts.

10:40.389 --> 10:42.350
I know the facts, okay?

10:42.433 --> 10:44.268
This is an open-and-shut, Donnie.

10:44.352 --> 10:46.395
With our workload,
we don't have enough time or money

10:46.479 --> 10:47.396
to even deal with this.

10:47.480 --> 10:49.774
Hell, the drug dealers we represent
make more money than us,

10:49.857 --> 10:51.359
and they have no respect for us.

10:51.442 --> 10:53.277
Look, I'm not gonna go back and forth
with you.

10:53.361 --> 10:54.487
- Sorry,
-You always do this.

10:54.570 --> 10:56.864
but what does that have to do
with the Sunday school teacher

10:56.947 --> 10:58.699
who bakes cookies
for kids in the neighborhood?

11:01.577 --> 11:03.913
Okay, so I think we should leave.

11:07.541 --> 11:10.086
You know, that is the most sensible thing
you've said all night.

11:10.169 --> 11:11.003
Thank you.

11:11.087 --> 11:13.089
You know,
I will never get used to seeing

11:13.172 --> 11:14.256
people going to jail.

11:14.340 --> 11:16.884
Either this is your cause, or it ain't.

11:17.635 --> 11:18.594
Figure it out, Jas.

11:20.429 --> 11:21.389
-Jordan.
-Night, girl.

11:21.472 --> 11:22.890
- Hm.
- So we'll see you tomorrow.

11:22.973 --> 11:24.350
-Yeah.
- Okay, y'all have a nice night.

11:24.433 --> 11:26.894
-Thanks for having us. Beautiful home.
- You, too, Tilsa.

11:26.977 --> 11:28.688
I'mma talk to him, okay?

11:28.771 --> 11:30.773
-Don't worry about it.
- Just a little chat.

11:30.856 --> 11:34.860
Donnie, get your ass over here!
This is why they don't invite us no more.

11:34.944 --> 11:36.362
How you actin' right now...

11:39.657 --> 11:41.867
-See what I mean?
- Yeah.

11:43.494 --> 11:44.495
Can't win.

11:53.587 --> 11:55.798
I saw an old woman fall to her death.

11:57.842 --> 11:58.801
But I'm all right.

12:03.139 --> 12:03.973
Your turn.

12:10.438 --> 12:12.940
You know,
when I graduated from law school...

12:15.401 --> 12:17.069
I thought I had hit the lottery.

12:17.862 --> 12:18.696
Yeah.

12:19.155 --> 12:20.948
But now that I'm into it, I...

12:24.034 --> 12:24.994
These people

12:25.453 --> 12:26.787
are murderers

12:27.747 --> 12:28.706
and liars.

12:29.540 --> 12:31.333
And they're thieves, babe.

12:32.334 --> 12:33.711
And to defend them, I...

12:37.631 --> 12:40.217
I'm just having second thoughts
about all of this.

12:42.136 --> 12:43.012
Really.

12:44.764 --> 12:47.224
I just wanna stay there long enough

12:47.933 --> 12:50.060
so I can get these student loans paid off.

12:54.023 --> 12:55.816
I don't want to be a lawyer anymore.

12:55.900 --> 12:57.109
No, come on.

12:57.193 --> 12:58.152
I don't.

13:01.739 --> 13:02.907
Oh, come on.

13:02.990 --> 13:04.074
I don't.

13:04.158 --> 13:06.702
- This is what you're meant to do.

13:07.411 --> 13:08.913
You know that, babe. Come on.

13:16.545 --> 13:19.548
Last night I may have had one too many.
My bad.

13:20.341 --> 13:21.509
Was that an apology?

13:21.592 --> 13:23.052
If that's what you call it.

13:23.135 --> 13:25.387
Well, I think you do a great job, Jasmine.

13:26.222 --> 13:27.431
Thanks, Tilsa.

13:28.724 --> 13:30.059
At about 7:30.

13:30.142 --> 13:32.895
When are you talking to, uh, the DA
about Grace Waters?

13:32.978 --> 13:34.730
-Uh, later this afternoon.
- Get it done,

13:34.814 --> 13:37.191
-get it done, get it done.
-I'm meeting him at court.

13:38.984 --> 13:39.819
Jasmine.

13:39.902 --> 13:41.904
There's a Malcolm Waters here to see you.

13:41.987 --> 13:42.863
Who's that?

13:43.739 --> 13:45.783
-I don't know.
-Is he in the appointment book?

13:45.866 --> 13:46.784
Okay, all right.

13:47.868 --> 13:48.702
Malcolm?

13:48.786 --> 13:50.204
Yes, are you Jasmine?

13:50.287 --> 13:51.288
Yes, hi.

13:51.372 --> 13:52.957
Grace Waters is my mother.

13:53.165 --> 13:54.542
-Oh.
-You're gonna help her, right?

13:55.000 --> 13:55.835
Um...

13:55.918 --> 13:57.419
- Uh, please.
-Uh...

13:57.503 --> 14:00.798
I love my mother,
and I know she's innocent. I know she is.

14:01.841 --> 14:04.176
-She couldn't do that to anyone. No one.

14:04.260 --> 14:06.136
She wouldn't even kill spiders
when I was growing up.

14:06.220 --> 14:07.930
She'd make my dad take 'em outside
in a cup.

14:08.013 --> 14:09.181
You have to help her.

14:10.266 --> 14:11.600
She wants to plead guilty.

14:11.684 --> 14:14.562
No, no, no,
don't let her do that, please.

14:14.645 --> 14:16.814
If I could talk to her.
She won't see me.

14:16.897 --> 14:19.358
You have to help her
or get me in to see her.

14:19.441 --> 14:21.068
You can't let her plead guilty.

14:22.611 --> 14:24.989
I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do.

14:25.447 --> 14:26.657
She wants to plead.

14:30.244 --> 14:31.245
I'm sorry.

14:34.790 --> 14:36.292
Absolutely not.

14:36.375 --> 14:39.003
-I want life without parole.
-Look, are you serious?

14:39.128 --> 14:41.547
She has no record. She's a model citizen.

14:41.630 --> 14:42.965
She has no priors.

14:43.048 --> 14:44.925
Come on, we want 15 years.

14:45.175 --> 14:46.135
No deal.

14:46.635 --> 14:48.846
She wants a plea, she gets the max.

14:51.515 --> 14:53.350
Well,
what about giving her Millstone Prison,

14:53.434 --> 14:56.103
-so she'll be closer to her son?
-That I'll consider.

14:58.564 --> 15:00.024
<i>They're offering the maximum,</i>

15:00.107 --> 15:02.651
life without the possibility of parole.

15:04.778 --> 15:08.240
-And that's the best they can do?
- He's adamant about it.

15:08.324 --> 15:11.911
If we went to trial,
he could ask for the death penalty.

15:16.123 --> 15:18.834
-I think you should take this deal.

15:21.462 --> 15:22.338
Okay.

15:25.966 --> 15:26.800
Okay?

15:31.805 --> 15:33.140
Okay, do it.

16:42.209 --> 16:43.252
<i>Yes?</i>

16:43.335 --> 16:44.712
<i> Hi, Miss Sarah?</i>

16:44.795 --> 16:45.629
<i> Yes?</i>

16:45.713 --> 16:47.172
<i>This is Jasmine Bryant.</i>

16:47.256 --> 16:48.757
<i>I'm representing Grace Waters.</i>

16:49.341 --> 16:51.885
<i>Is it possible that I could come by</i>
<i>this morning?</i>

16:51.969 --> 16:53.637
<i>Why, yes, I'm home.</i>

16:53.721 --> 16:56.974
<i>My address is 2342 West Lesson Lane.</i>

16:57.599 --> 16:59.435
- <i>Okay. Thank you.</i>
-<i> All right.</i>

17:00.185 --> 17:01.228
<i>See you then.</i>

17:02.354 --> 17:03.272
Hi.

17:04.147 --> 17:06.400
Hi, uh, would you mind, please?

17:06.483 --> 17:07.984
- Oh, sure.
-This thing is so heavy.

17:08.068 --> 17:09.737
- No problem.
-Oh, my goodness.

17:09.819 --> 17:11.405
I got three tenants.

17:11.821 --> 17:14.074
-Ooh, yeah.

17:14.199 --> 17:16.160
Just get it on this curb,
and we'll be fine.

17:16.242 --> 17:17.243
- Okay.

17:19.413 --> 17:21.498
-Thank you. Thank you so much.

17:21.582 --> 17:22.540
Okay.

17:23.916 --> 17:25.419
Oh, yeah, that's, uh--

17:26.045 --> 17:27.963
That's one of my tenants, there.

17:28.047 --> 17:29.548
They don't have family. It's sad.

17:29.631 --> 17:30.507
But come on in, honey.

17:30.591 --> 17:32.468
-Come in out of this rain.
- Okay.

17:32.551 --> 17:33.552
Do you like coffee?

17:33.635 --> 17:36.388
- Oh, I do. Thank you very much.
- All right.

17:39.349 --> 17:41.643
They said there would be sunshine today.

17:43.062 --> 17:44.521
So much for what they know.

17:44.605 --> 17:47.524
-I know, right? I know.

17:49.193 --> 17:50.402
- So...

17:51.070 --> 17:53.238
...what brings you to see me?

17:53.697 --> 17:54.531
Um...

17:57.242 --> 17:58.494
Tears.

17:59.787 --> 18:00.704
Um...

18:01.205 --> 18:03.123
I saw Miss Grace cry tears

18:03.207 --> 18:06.376
that I've never seen
a guilty person cry yesterday.

18:07.294 --> 18:09.630
You know, I have to tell you,
I feel really bad.

18:11.048 --> 18:12.591
A lot of this is my fault.

18:14.426 --> 18:15.552
Why do you say that?

18:16.845 --> 18:19.515
Age is a bitch, darling.
It'll sneak up on you.

18:20.140 --> 18:23.811
One day you all lovely-lookin',
just like you, all young and lovely.

18:24.186 --> 18:27.773
Seem like the next day you're my age,
wondering where all the time went.

18:27.856 --> 18:30.859
- I'm a little older than she is.

18:32.736 --> 18:35.697
But I didn't want her to be like me.

18:36.406 --> 18:37.282
Lonely...

18:38.117 --> 18:39.284
and livin' in a house

18:39.910 --> 18:42.121
with old ladies and their cats.

18:42.788 --> 18:46.375
She's such a good soul.

18:47.126 --> 18:49.711
So, I tried to encourage her to go out,

18:49.795 --> 18:51.296
you know, all the time, but...

18:52.131 --> 18:53.090
she wouldn't do it.

18:54.925 --> 18:55.759
Thank you.

18:55.843 --> 18:58.720
You're welcome.
And then, when her, uh, son got married...

19:00.139 --> 19:02.057
...that's when everything took a turn.

19:02.724 --> 19:07.396
I mean, I literally watched
as she changed before my very eyes.

19:07.479 --> 19:11.608
It was after the wedding. We were sitting
and talking over a glass of wine, and...

19:11.942 --> 19:15.445
Oh, she was so sad about
what she thought her life would be,

19:15.529 --> 19:17.656
and... and what it was.

19:17.739 --> 19:19.032
And it wasn't bad.

19:19.575 --> 19:22.161
No, 'cause she had a lovely home.
Beautiful home.

19:22.244 --> 19:24.163
-And a good job, too.
-Okay.

19:24.246 --> 19:25.789
But her ex-husband,

19:25.873 --> 19:28.000
he was living better than she was, and...

19:28.709 --> 19:33.714
seemed like his wife was living
Grace's dream, and--

19:35.048 --> 19:36.258
You gonna take notes?

19:37.301 --> 19:39.469
Oh. Yes. Uh, thank you.

19:45.017 --> 19:45.893
Yes.

19:46.560 --> 19:49.188
So, it was after the wedding,

19:49.855 --> 19:52.774
and we had come in.
We hadn't even taken off our dresses,

19:52.858 --> 19:56.320
when she started to just--
just come apart at the seams.

19:56.403 --> 19:59.489
I mean, that wedding took place
in her ex-husband's house,

19:59.573 --> 20:01.200
and that used to be Grace's house.

20:01.283 --> 20:02.910
-Hmm.
-Mm-hmm.

20:03.118 --> 20:05.954
I don't know, Grace, why'd they have
to have a wedding in the house?

20:06.038 --> 20:07.331
-Mm-hmm.
-And those tacky drapes.

20:07.414 --> 20:09.416
Wait, now, those were my drapes.

20:09.499 --> 20:11.251
Thank you.

20:11.335 --> 20:15.005
-He didn't even change the drapes?
-He didn't even change the drapes.

20:15.088 --> 20:17.507
We built a life in that house.

20:18.717 --> 20:20.052
And here I am, just...

20:20.594 --> 20:21.553
Angry.

20:21.637 --> 20:24.890
No, I'm not really angry.
I'm just hurt.

20:24.973 --> 20:27.267
And angry. Go on, say it.

20:27.726 --> 20:28.560
Okay.

20:29.186 --> 20:30.938
Okay, I am angry.

20:31.021 --> 20:32.356
Damn right.

20:32.439 --> 20:34.524
And you have every right, so be pissed.

20:35.150 --> 20:35.984
Hell.

20:36.193 --> 20:38.445
That little heifer's young enough
to be his daughter.

20:38.528 --> 20:39.363
Right?

20:41.198 --> 20:43.575
She is five years older than my son.

20:44.618 --> 20:45.786
Our son.

20:47.829 --> 20:48.997
Just so unfair.

20:49.623 --> 20:51.875
It's like he just went on with his life.

20:53.543 --> 20:56.713
Like I was some kind of speed bump
that just slowed him down.

20:59.091 --> 20:59.925
Just...

21:04.054 --> 21:05.264
How did I even get here?

21:07.391 --> 21:08.725
I want my life back.

21:11.395 --> 21:13.272
I want my youth back.

21:14.690 --> 21:15.691
I want to laugh.

21:17.317 --> 21:19.152
I wanna love somebody, I wanna...

21:19.945 --> 21:20.779
be loved.

21:21.697 --> 21:24.199
-I can't help you with your youth,

21:24.449 --> 21:26.451
but I can help you with the rest of it.

21:27.953 --> 21:30.789
You need to get the hell out this house
and meet somebody.

21:30.872 --> 21:32.124
Who?

21:32.791 --> 21:34.668
-I don't know.

21:34.751 --> 21:36.461
But I see these commercials on TV.

21:36.545 --> 21:41.049
You could go on ChristianDateOnline.com.

21:41.133 --> 21:42.050
What?

21:42.134 --> 21:44.136
- You could!
-No, I could not.

21:44.219 --> 21:46.847
No. Come on, now, Sarah.

21:47.639 --> 21:51.101
No, come on. If I wanted to meet someone,
I want to do it...

21:51.685 --> 21:53.478
I want to do it the old-fashioned way.

21:54.354 --> 21:57.024
Might be a little late in the evening
for the old-fashioned way.

21:57.107 --> 21:59.735
- <i>So how'd the two meet?</i>

22:00.444 --> 22:01.903
At an art gallery.

22:02.738 --> 22:03.572
Hold on.

22:05.782 --> 22:07.034
Let me see.

22:18.920 --> 22:20.380
Hi there. Oh...

22:22.549 --> 22:25.635
This is a flyer
from when they repossessed her house.

22:27.346 --> 22:28.847
They put everything out on the street,

22:28.930 --> 22:31.266
and I gathered those things that I could,
at least the things

22:31.350 --> 22:33.894
-I thought that would be of value to her.
- Mm-hmm.

22:34.311 --> 22:38.815
This is a flyer from his show
at that gallery where she met him.

22:38.899 --> 22:40.067
-Oh.
- Mm-hmm.

22:40.817 --> 22:42.903
That's his photograph.

22:43.487 --> 22:45.989
He gave her the original
the day after he met her.

22:46.573 --> 22:47.783
He was a photographer.

22:48.450 --> 22:49.618
You can keep that.

22:49.701 --> 22:50.535
Thank you.

22:50.619 --> 22:54.289
I'd love to talk to you some more,
but my ladies haven't had their breakfast.

22:55.582 --> 22:58.251
Would you mind if we talked again later?

22:58.335 --> 23:01.588
Oh, okay. Um, sure. Um...

23:03.423 --> 23:05.675
Thank you.
Thank you so much for having me.

23:05.759 --> 23:07.094
No, thank you for coming.

23:07.177 --> 23:08.512
Huh? It's...

23:08.678 --> 23:10.889
-Okay. Oh! Um...

23:11.139 --> 23:12.599
-That's nothing, come on.
-Okay.

23:12.682 --> 23:16.686
Uh, thank you for caring so much
about Grace and taking good care.

23:16.770 --> 23:17.938
All right, thank you so much.

23:18.021 --> 23:19.731
- All right.
- Have a great day.

23:19.815 --> 23:21.942
- Thank you. Buh-bye.
- Okay, bye-bye.

23:30.409 --> 23:31.243
Hey, babe.

23:31.743 --> 23:32.953
Come here, look at this.

23:33.036 --> 23:34.621
Can I get a hello first?
Can I get some love?

23:34.704 --> 23:35.539
Hey.

23:36.081 --> 23:38.875
Okay. Now, look at this
and tell me what you see.

23:38.959 --> 23:42.003
-Uh... that's luminol.
-Yes.

23:42.087 --> 23:44.256
- It's a lot of blood, too.
- Mm-hmm.

23:44.923 --> 23:47.801
And it's dark in some places
and lighter in the others.

23:48.718 --> 23:49.928
Yeah, and?

23:50.011 --> 23:53.473
And if he lost this much blood, say,
from a blow to the head,

23:54.057 --> 23:56.143
why is it pooling from the outside in,

23:56.226 --> 23:58.895
as it looks like it did in the picture?
Hmm?

23:59.354 --> 24:02.190
Then I'd say that you're asking
the questions a good lawyer would.

24:10.323 --> 24:11.658
Rory, hi.

24:11.741 --> 24:14.953
-Some coffee in here, please. Yeah?
-Um, yeah, I wanted you to see this.

24:15.036 --> 24:17.205
You see how the blood is pooling
from the outside in?

24:17.289 --> 24:19.791
-Yeah.
-I wanna hire an expert in blood splatter

24:19.875 --> 24:20.876
and in luminol--

24:20.959 --> 24:22.752
Where have you been
for the past nine months?

24:22.836 --> 24:24.880
This office cannot afford
a blood pattern expert.

24:24.963 --> 24:26.715
What you talking about?
What's this about anyway?

24:27.549 --> 24:28.884
Grace Waters, her defense.

24:31.887 --> 24:33.388
That woman is pleading guilty.

24:33.472 --> 24:35.182
I don't know what you're talking about.

24:35.265 --> 24:38.018
Now, get down to the jail
and get the plea deal signed.

24:38.101 --> 24:39.561
It's already there. Get it signed.

24:39.644 --> 24:41.771
This circus needs to stop.
My phone's ringing off the hook.

24:41.855 --> 24:43.815
I've got the mayor and everybody
calling me about this.

24:43.899 --> 24:46.443
Rory, but I found some really great stuff,
and I think--

24:46.526 --> 24:47.360
Jasmine.

24:49.321 --> 24:50.989
If you argued like this in court,

24:51.072 --> 24:52.782
you could actually be a lawyer.

24:53.200 --> 24:54.034
Go.

25:00.582 --> 25:02.459
Coffee! Coffee! Coffee!

25:04.085 --> 25:05.504
- So sorry.
-Thank you.

25:07.339 --> 25:08.632
What the hell is this?

25:11.551 --> 25:14.513
This is the plea agreement from the DA.

25:15.305 --> 25:18.058
He did manage to say
that he will put you in a facility

25:18.141 --> 25:19.726
that's close to your son.

25:22.646 --> 25:23.730
You can sign here.

25:28.944 --> 25:30.487
You have a pen?

25:31.780 --> 25:33.073
Yeah. Sorry.

25:49.965 --> 25:51.424
Who've you been talkin' to?

25:52.551 --> 25:55.053
Your friend Sarah.

25:57.722 --> 25:59.808
Grace, please tell me what happened.

26:00.892 --> 26:02.227
What did he do to you?

26:04.437 --> 26:05.313
Please.

26:07.315 --> 26:08.149
Tell me.

26:15.574 --> 26:16.783
<i>Heels.</i>

26:21.079 --> 26:22.205
Heels.

26:28.253 --> 26:30.714
I don't know why
I remember the heels that day.

26:31.840 --> 26:33.967
It was a normal day, like any other.

26:38.346 --> 26:39.556
When you wake up...

26:42.475 --> 26:44.019
you don't know that...

26:46.521 --> 26:50.233
today will be the day
to change your life...

26:54.904 --> 26:55.739
End it.

26:58.450 --> 27:00.452
<i>Everything felt so normal.</i>

27:05.957 --> 27:07.000
Thank you.

27:18.720 --> 27:22.432
<i>After work that day,</i>
<i>I went to a... a gallery opening.</i>

27:23.266 --> 27:24.559
<i>I was a little tired,</i>

27:24.643 --> 27:28.772
<i>but I wanted to see this exhibit</i>
<i>that Sarah had told me about.</i>

27:29.230 --> 27:32.442
<i>She was worried about me</i>
<i>being in the house too much. </i>

27:33.735 --> 27:35.945
<i>But she was adamant that I go, so...</i>

27:37.322 --> 27:38.156
<i>I did.</i>

27:39.115 --> 27:42.202
- Hi.
<i>-</i> Excuse me.<i> </i> I'm sorry.

27:43.286 --> 27:44.162
-Ah...
-I get it,

27:44.245 --> 27:48.375
you have to see these in the right light.
And the best lighting in the room is...

27:49.250 --> 27:50.627
right here, so...

27:52.003 --> 27:53.254
The owner's a family friend,

27:53.338 --> 27:55.799
and I don't have the heart to tell her
that the lighting sucks.

27:55.882 --> 27:59.844
Well, it's not really that bad
from right here.

28:00.428 --> 28:02.430
And what do you know
about shadows and light?

28:02.722 --> 28:03.640
Well...

28:04.099 --> 28:06.893
I don't know anything
as well as this photographer.

28:08.019 --> 28:10.188
She's... brilliant.

28:10.271 --> 28:12.315
What makes you so sure that she's a she?

28:13.692 --> 28:15.568
Hmm. The name.

28:16.820 --> 28:17.696
Shannon.

28:18.071 --> 28:19.614
And look at the shadows,

28:19.698 --> 28:22.701
the way she captures
the emotions of these tribes.

28:22.784 --> 28:25.704
Now, only a woman sees like that.
It's beautiful.

28:25.787 --> 28:27.872
You know what?
I think she's Ethiopian, too,

28:27.956 --> 28:31.710
because she has to know somebody to get in
and get to know these people.

28:31.793 --> 28:34.671
Some of these places are extremely remote.

28:34.754 --> 28:38.508
I think only a native
can navigate this closely.

28:39.050 --> 28:40.802
You seem to know a lot about Ethiopia.

28:40.885 --> 28:43.805
Just what I've read.

28:44.222 --> 28:45.515
I love Africa.

28:45.932 --> 28:46.933
African history.

28:47.350 --> 28:48.560
- Mm.
-I wanna go one day.

28:49.144 --> 28:51.146
You should. It'll change your life.

28:52.021 --> 28:53.606
Oh, you've been?

28:53.690 --> 28:55.567
-I have.
- Lucky you.

28:55.650 --> 28:57.402
-Lucky me, to meet you.
-Mm-hmm.

29:00.238 --> 29:01.614
Ooh, wow, is that a...

29:01.698 --> 29:03.825
-Is that an Uzo <i> </i> necklace?
-Yeah, good eye.

29:04.367 --> 29:05.994
-Wow.
-Got this in Africa. One of a kind.

29:08.913 --> 29:09.831
Wow.

29:09.914 --> 29:10.749
Beautiful.

29:11.624 --> 29:12.625
We need you.

29:13.334 --> 29:15.211
Excuse me while I take
this handsome thing away.

29:15.754 --> 29:16.921
-Please.
-Absolutely.

29:17.005 --> 29:19.382
Okay.

29:23.803 --> 29:25.221
Ladies and gentlemen,

29:25.305 --> 29:27.182
thank you so much
for coming to this exhibit.

29:27.265 --> 29:31.728
We are so excited
to have this amazing artist here.

29:32.103 --> 29:34.272
We love his work here in Holloway.

29:34.355 --> 29:37.859
Introducing Shannon Delong,
ladies and gentlemen.

29:41.279 --> 29:43.698
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much
for coming out tonight.

29:43.782 --> 29:45.283
I really appreciate that.

29:45.742 --> 29:48.244
Um, for those of you that don't know me,

29:48.953 --> 29:50.121
I am an introvert,

29:50.747 --> 29:53.750
which means I have trouble
speaking in front of...

29:55.251 --> 29:57.253
-semi-large crowds.

29:57.337 --> 29:59.923
But I hope
you enjoy the exhibit. It's called "Guzo."

30:00.006 --> 30:02.258
It is from my travels in Ethiopia.

30:02.675 --> 30:03.635
And remember...

30:04.719 --> 30:07.222
a lot of the proceeds tonight
go to charity, so...

30:07.847 --> 30:09.516
please spend a large amount of money.

30:09.599 --> 30:12.060
- Hear, hear.
- Okay? Thank you.

30:12.143 --> 30:13.353
-Enjoy.

30:26.950 --> 30:28.493
<i>The next day, I got to work,</i>

30:28.576 --> 30:31.746
<i>and I didn't even know</i>
<i>how he found out where I worked,</i>

30:31.830 --> 30:33.081
<i>but there it was.</i>

30:33.164 --> 30:34.833
<i>He was flirting with me.</i>

30:35.416 --> 30:38.294
<i>Nobody had flirted with me in 25 years,</i>

30:38.378 --> 30:39.963
<i>and I had butterflies.</i>

30:40.338 --> 30:42.090
<i>Grown-ass woman with butterflies.</i>

30:43.091 --> 30:45.635
<i>It was beautifully tragic.</i>

30:46.177 --> 30:48.805
<i>Before I knew it, I was smiling and giddy.</i>

30:49.222 --> 30:50.765
<i>I felt like a schoolgirl.</i>

30:51.349 --> 30:54.561
<i>I wondered, "Why? Who was this man?</i>

30:55.061 --> 30:56.604
<i>Why was he flirting with me?"</i>

30:56.855 --> 30:59.983
<i>That voice in my head was screaming,</i>
<i>"What does he want? What does he want?"</i>

31:00.733 --> 31:02.777
<i>But I was intrigued.</i>

31:03.319 --> 31:06.489
<i>So I called Sarah</i>
<i>to see if I should go out with him.</i>

31:07.448 --> 31:10.159
<i>You will not believe</i>
<i>what your photographer did.</i>

31:10.243 --> 31:11.661
Do you need me to drive you?

31:11.744 --> 31:15.123
<i>-'Cause you </i> are <i>going. Call him.</i>
- What?

31:15.748 --> 31:16.708
Call him.

31:17.375 --> 31:20.295
Okay, okay. I will.

31:20.378 --> 31:22.964
You are crazy and pushy.

31:24.215 --> 31:26.676
<i>I did wait a day to call him.</i>

31:26.968 --> 31:28.303
<i>I couldn't seem desperate.</i>

31:28.386 --> 31:29.304
Call you?

31:30.930 --> 31:32.724
Yeah, I don't think so, buddy.

31:34.684 --> 31:36.895
<i>But curiosity got the best of me.</i>

31:36.978 --> 31:39.063
<i>When I got to work the next day, I said,</i>

31:39.522 --> 31:40.648
<i>"What the hell?"</i>

31:42.942 --> 31:46.195
- <i>Hi.</i>
-Hi. Um, uh...

31:46.279 --> 31:47.405
<i>How are you?</i>

31:49.365 --> 31:52.368
Oh, don't act like you know who this is.

31:52.452 --> 31:53.786
<i>It's Grace, right?</i>

31:54.287 --> 31:56.915
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- <i>You got my photo?</i>

31:57.373 --> 31:59.751
- <i>Yes, I did. Thank you.</i>
<i>-</i> <i>No.</i>

31:59.959 --> 32:01.920
<i>I'm not accepting your thank-you</i>
<i>over the phone.</i>

32:02.003 --> 32:03.838
<i>Oh. </i> <i>O-Okay.</i>

32:04.255 --> 32:06.799
- <i>Only over dinner.</i>
<i>-</i><i> Mm. Okay.</i>

32:06.883 --> 32:10.053
<i>I know this perfect, little,</i>
<i>quaint, hole-in-the-wall diner.</i>

32:10.136 --> 32:11.930
<i>Well, I-I'm fine with that.</i>

32:15.141 --> 32:15.975
Thank you.

32:17.352 --> 32:18.811
So, tell me something,

32:18.895 --> 32:20.521
how did you find me?

32:20.939 --> 32:22.148
You signed my guestbook.

32:22.732 --> 32:25.151
Tell me something.
Why'd it take you so long to call me?

32:28.154 --> 32:30.740
I mean, there I was,
I met this beautiful woman

32:31.157 --> 32:32.659
that I wanted to know a lot more about,

32:32.742 --> 32:35.161
and she just kinda left me standing there,
so...

32:36.079 --> 32:40.041
I know you've had many young,
beautiful women.

32:40.124 --> 32:41.000
I mean, um...

32:42.710 --> 32:44.003
I was just wondering.

32:44.545 --> 32:46.089
-Why me?

32:46.923 --> 32:48.758
First of all, yes.

32:49.842 --> 32:51.469
I have had more than my share.

32:52.053 --> 32:55.515
But as you get older, that kind of thing
no longer interests you,

32:55.598 --> 32:57.684
and you said
something kind of interesting to me.

32:57.767 --> 33:00.144
You said, "Why me?"

33:00.937 --> 33:02.939
As people, we--
we tend to do that to ourselves.

33:03.022 --> 33:05.316
It's always like,
"Why me? Why me? Why me?"

33:05.608 --> 33:07.944
Shouldn't the question be,
"Why <i>not </i> you?"

33:10.488 --> 33:11.906
Divorce will do that to you.

33:13.116 --> 33:13.950
Make you...

33:14.450 --> 33:16.035
question who you are.

33:18.246 --> 33:19.497
So, why get divorced?

33:20.623 --> 33:21.708
People grow apart.

33:23.543 --> 33:24.669
Why aren't you married?

33:24.752 --> 33:27.255
-That question, yeah.
- Mmm.

33:27.880 --> 33:30.758
Now, I-I guess
it's just 'cause I grew up everywhere,

33:31.342 --> 33:34.178
and I was always kind of a gypsy.
Military kid.

33:34.721 --> 33:37.974
Uh, name it, New York, Boston,

33:38.641 --> 33:40.309
Atlanta, DC, Seattle,

33:40.393 --> 33:43.479
Korea, Madrid, Japan, West Africa,
in that order.

33:43.563 --> 33:45.148
-Wow.

33:45.231 --> 33:47.608
Name a culture, I saw it.
I experienced it.

33:47.692 --> 33:49.736
But that was also hard to, you know,

33:49.819 --> 33:51.529
put down roots as a young man.

33:52.613 --> 33:53.990
I never wanted to be married.

33:56.242 --> 33:58.703
If I'm honest,
I really didn't want the responsibility,

33:58.786 --> 34:02.373
and a lot of women are into that.
You'd be surprised, you know.

34:02.457 --> 34:04.000
Yeah, I know.

34:04.083 --> 34:06.377
-Yeah.
-But that had to be hard as a kid,

34:06.461 --> 34:08.212
I mean, living everywhere.

34:08.295 --> 34:09.964
It was. But it was fun as a man.

34:10.922 --> 34:12.759
- No, not... I don't...

34:12.842 --> 34:15.219
'Cause not everything's about that.
Your mind's in the gutter.

34:15.303 --> 34:16.262
Okay? Yeah.

34:17.513 --> 34:19.223
I mean, seeing the world...

34:19.306 --> 34:20.183
Mm-hmm?

34:20.266 --> 34:22.976
...through the eyes of a 35-millimeter,
there's...

34:23.853 --> 34:24.728
nothing like that.

34:24.812 --> 34:27.732
-That sounds like fun.
- It was. Met a lot of people.

34:28.399 --> 34:29.984
-But I never met a stranger.
- Mm.

34:30.443 --> 34:31.944
I mean, take us, for example.

34:33.487 --> 34:35.989
-What?
-Well, don't you feel comfortable with me?

34:36.074 --> 34:37.824
- Honestly?

34:38.618 --> 34:40.203
Well, honestly, I just met you.

34:41.954 --> 34:43.748
And if we're being honest,
let's keep being honest.

34:43.831 --> 34:46.083
You keep doing this one thing.
You keep doing this one--

34:46.167 --> 34:48.795
-You have a pattern. You judge.
-Ooh. Oh.

34:48.878 --> 34:51.005
You can't say you don't,
because I'm watching you do it.

34:51.089 --> 34:51.964
- Okay.
-You judge.

34:52.047 --> 34:53.174
You know, it's just...

34:54.342 --> 34:55.467
It's kinda hard...

34:56.803 --> 35:00.473
you know,
when you walk in the room, and you...

35:01.516 --> 35:04.602
find your husband having sex
with his secretary,

35:04.685 --> 35:06.145
who is now his wife.

35:12.443 --> 35:13.861
I'm sorry to hear that.

35:14.654 --> 35:15.613
Thank you.

35:18.324 --> 35:19.200
Wine?

35:20.493 --> 35:22.745
Yes.

35:22.829 --> 35:26.040
<i> I </i> did <i>start to trust him</i>
<i>very quickly.</i>

35:26.666 --> 35:28.042
<i>I don't even know why.</i>

35:28.334 --> 35:32.171
<i>He was so kind,</i>
<i>and... and he knew what to say.</i>

35:32.839 --> 35:33.881
<i>He was gentle.</i>

35:34.549 --> 35:39.095
<i>I didn't even know that a man could be</i>
<i>that perfect, feel that perfect.</i>

35:39.428 --> 35:41.681
<i>I didn't want our first date to end.</i>

35:42.348 --> 35:43.558
<i>And neither did he.</i>

35:47.937 --> 35:48.896
Thank you, Kaitlyn.

35:51.816 --> 35:53.151
-Whoo!

35:53.234 --> 35:56.404
So your ex, he, uh...
he owns a mortgage company?

35:56.487 --> 35:59.073
Oh...
Why are you still on that?

35:59.323 --> 36:00.658
Okay.

36:01.033 --> 36:04.162
Hint, if a...
if a man is asking about your ex,

36:04.245 --> 36:05.997
it's because he's trying to see
how he measures up.

36:06.080 --> 36:06.998
Oh.

36:07.248 --> 36:09.083
And from what I can ascertain,

36:10.042 --> 36:11.878
unlike me, he's rich, and so are you.

36:14.213 --> 36:17.258
Well, <i>he</i> owns a mortgage company.

36:17.341 --> 36:20.303
- Mm.
-Not me. And I'm not rich.

36:21.387 --> 36:24.557
-I left the marriage and everything in it.
- Hmm?

36:24.640 --> 36:28.144
-You didn't fight for the money?
-Not a thing, no. I didn't want anything.

36:28.686 --> 36:32.398
I just wanted out.
I was... tired of the lies.

36:32.481 --> 36:33.858
-I get that.
- Mmm.

36:33.941 --> 36:34.942
I don't know why that is,

36:35.026 --> 36:37.069
why men have so much trouble
just being honest.

36:37.153 --> 36:38.738
And so you always tell the truth?

36:38.821 --> 36:41.657
Absolutely, 100%.
It-- It gets me in trouble sometimes,

36:41.741 --> 36:44.577
because I have this thing where
I just always say what's on my mind.

36:44.660 --> 36:46.996
Oh...

36:47.496 --> 36:48.372
Okay.

36:48.456 --> 36:51.876
Oh, my God. It is 2:00 a.m.

36:51.959 --> 36:52.793
Wow.

36:52.877 --> 36:56.172
I have to be at work at, uh, 7:00.

36:56.714 --> 36:57.590
Quit.

37:00.927 --> 37:02.178
Am I gonna see you again?

37:02.553 --> 37:04.430
Do you wanna see me again?

37:05.514 --> 37:07.016
I don't want you to leave now.

37:08.434 --> 37:09.310
Good night.

37:12.355 --> 37:14.565
<i>I didn't even realize</i>
<i>how long it had been</i>

37:14.649 --> 37:16.484
<i>since I had been touched,</i>

37:16.567 --> 37:19.111
<i>since I had a man reach for my hand.</i>

37:20.154 --> 37:24.909
<i>I felt something in me</i>
<i>that I hadn't felt in years.</i>

37:25.576 --> 37:29.288
<i>I tried to identify the feeling,</i>
<i>the emotions,</i>

37:29.372 --> 37:31.540
<i>but I couldn't bring it into focus</i>

37:31.624 --> 37:36.087
<i>because it was warmed over in fear.</i>

37:36.170 --> 37:38.464
<i>I was so terrified.</i>

37:38.547 --> 37:40.549
<i>The alarms going off in my head,</i>

37:40.633 --> 37:43.135
<i>telling myself</i>
<i>that I was too old for this shit.</i>

37:43.511 --> 37:46.305
<i>In my head,</i>
<i>I'm hearing that he's leading me on,</i>

37:46.514 --> 37:47.807
<i>that he wanted something.</i>

37:48.349 --> 37:52.061
<i>So I kept repeating to myself</i>
<i>what he said.</i>

37:52.144 --> 37:53.396
<i>"Why not you?" </i>

37:53.479 --> 37:55.523
<i>Why not me?</i>

37:56.148 --> 37:58.359
<i>Maybe God had answered</i>
<i>a seven-year-old prayer</i>

37:58.442 --> 38:00.569
<i>that I had prayed since my divorce.</i>

38:00.653 --> 38:02.655
<i>Maybe this </i> was <i>him.</i>

38:02.738 --> 38:05.741
<i>Somehow, he knew me</i>
<i>almost better than I did myself.</i>

38:06.284 --> 38:09.787
<i>Ooh, he was in my head</i>
<i>and well on his way to my heart,</i>

38:10.246 --> 38:14.166
<i>and I hadn't even known this man</i>
<i>for two days.</i>

38:15.793 --> 38:17.044
I know I'm a fool.

38:17.878 --> 38:20.715
-You're not a fool.
-Then what would you call it?

38:21.882 --> 38:22.717
Human.

38:24.135 --> 38:25.720
I don't wanna talk about this no more.

38:25.803 --> 38:28.723
No. Grace,<i> </i> please.

38:29.140 --> 38:30.433
Go on.

38:31.767 --> 38:32.643
So, tell me.

38:32.727 --> 38:34.395
<i>He was a perfect gentleman.</i>

38:34.478 --> 38:36.439
-What do you dream about?
-Mm-mm.

38:37.023 --> 38:39.567
-Dreams come with heartaches, so no.

38:39.650 --> 38:40.526
No, no, no, no.

38:40.609 --> 38:43.446
I know, somewhere in that big heart
of yours, you still dream.

38:43.529 --> 38:44.447
Come on.

38:44.613 --> 38:48.075
Well, my dream <i>was</i> to be a great mother.

38:48.743 --> 38:51.537
And I managed to do that.

38:52.371 --> 38:54.290
Ah, I got a great kid.

38:55.833 --> 38:59.086
Got about two more years
in graduate school.

38:59.170 --> 39:01.422
-Hmm?
-One of the proudest moments of my life.

39:01.505 --> 39:03.299
-Okay.

39:03.382 --> 39:05.384
You beam about him when you talk.

39:05.468 --> 39:07.970
-Oh, that's my heart.
-Ah.

39:08.054 --> 39:09.972
I just don't like
the tramp he's married to.

39:10.056 --> 39:12.433
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
t-tell me how you really feel.

39:12.516 --> 39:15.978
I know. I'm sorry, God.
I don't call women names.

39:16.062 --> 39:18.481
-You just did.
<i>-</i>

39:18.564 --> 39:19.482
Yeah.

39:19.940 --> 39:20.858
It's just, he...

39:22.318 --> 39:24.153
-He deserves better.
- Hm.

39:25.112 --> 39:27.239
But I gotta let him be an adult,
you know?

39:27.323 --> 39:28.240
That you do.

39:28.324 --> 39:30.743
Boys will be boys. You have to let them
make their mistakes.

39:30.826 --> 39:32.995
Spoken like someone who's made a few.

39:33.079 --> 39:34.747
-More than a few. A lot.
- Mm.

39:36.916 --> 39:40.544
But, like your son,
I adored my mother.

39:40.628 --> 39:43.506
How do you know he adores me?

39:44.507 --> 39:45.383
How could he not?

39:47.426 --> 39:51.263
Well, we don't talk as much...
since she came around.

39:51.806 --> 39:52.932
That's a shame.

39:53.933 --> 39:58.020
I used to talk to my mother...
every day, three times a day sometimes.

39:58.104 --> 40:00.481
-Oh, wow, that's beautiful.
- Yeah.

40:01.732 --> 40:06.445
You know, I've been walking you home
several nights in a row now.

40:06.529 --> 40:08.864
-Yeah.
-Yeah, it's been-- it's been nice.

40:08.948 --> 40:11.117
But I've never seen
the inside of the house.

40:11.200 --> 40:12.576
I'm just kind of wondering why that is.

40:12.660 --> 40:16.372
Is it because you got a man in there?
Did your ex-husband buy the house?

40:16.497 --> 40:18.082
Is he hiding in the bushes
with an OJ knife?

40:18.165 --> 40:20.167
- Oh, wait.
-Does he own a white Bronco?

40:20.251 --> 40:21.669
-Stop.
-What's happening?

40:21.752 --> 40:24.713
Just stop.
Now, you know I don't have nobody,

40:24.797 --> 40:27.883
and ain't nobody in that house.
And I bought my own house, thank you.

40:28.676 --> 40:30.177
-Excuse me.

40:30.803 --> 40:32.972
You know this house was built
in the 1800s?

40:33.055 --> 40:35.766
And I refurbished it all by myself,
thank you.

40:35.850 --> 40:36.684
Wow.

40:36.767 --> 40:38.894
A lot of blood, sweat, and tears in there.

40:38.978 --> 40:40.062
But I love it.

40:41.522 --> 40:43.858
Very first house I ever bought.

40:45.192 --> 40:46.026
It's beautiful.

40:46.110 --> 40:47.111
Thank you.

40:47.987 --> 40:49.864
I would love to see the inside.

40:52.533 --> 40:54.743
You've been a perfect gentleman, Shannon.

40:56.954 --> 40:58.205
Mmm, but...

40:58.914 --> 40:59.957
That's still a no?

41:01.292 --> 41:02.168
For now.

41:04.628 --> 41:05.463
Okay.

41:07.423 --> 41:08.299
Tomorrow, then.

41:09.550 --> 41:10.885
-Okay.
-Same time?

41:10.968 --> 41:11.802
Mm-hmm.

41:11.886 --> 41:13.846
-Different place?
- Mm-hmm.

41:14.180 --> 41:15.014
French, maybe?

41:16.056 --> 41:17.725
-Okay.
-You like French?

41:18.350 --> 41:20.019
<i>-Oui, oui.</i>
-Ooh.

41:20.102 --> 41:21.103
<i>Enchanté.</i>

41:25.441 --> 41:26.442
Good night.

41:26.525 --> 41:27.401
<i>Au revoir.</i>

41:33.699 --> 41:36.911
<i>Now, when I was in my 20s,</i>
<i>I could do that, out every night,</i>

41:36.994 --> 41:38.996
<i>but not so at this time in my life.</i>

41:39.079 --> 41:40.706
<i>I was so damn tired at work,</i>

41:41.415 --> 41:46.128
<i>but it didn't matter. I felt alive again.</i>
<i>I felt free.</i>

41:47.254 --> 41:49.590
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>I was burning the midnight oil</i>

41:49.673 --> 41:51.759
<i>and the candle at both ends.</i>

41:51.842 --> 41:53.969
<i>I was falling asleep at my desk,</i>

41:54.053 --> 41:56.639
<i>some days, in meetings with my boss.</i>

41:56.722 --> 41:58.098
<i>I was so out of my head,</i>

41:59.183 --> 42:00.226
<i>but I didn't care.</i>

42:00.643 --> 42:03.354
<i>All those years at that bank,</i>
<i>and I didn't even care.</i>

42:04.647 --> 42:07.816
<i>I was loving every moment</i>
<i>of being thought about</i>

42:07.900 --> 42:10.402
<i>and called and texted.</i>

42:10.861 --> 42:13.948
<i>I was just in heaven.</i>

42:16.784 --> 42:20.246
- <i>♪ Oh! ♪</i>
- <i>♪ Ride on Jesus ♪</i>

42:20.329 --> 42:22.540
<i>Three months came and went</i>
<i>like three days,</i>

42:22.623 --> 42:24.750
<i>and... and I had held him off,</i>

42:25.125 --> 42:29.004
<i>but I knew the time was comin',</i>
<i>and, oh, he was trying.</i>

42:29.338 --> 42:32.841
<i>I mean, the man was going to church</i>
<i>with me,</i>

42:32.925 --> 42:34.635
<i>and he wasn't even the type at all.</i>

42:34.718 --> 42:38.347
<i>He was not into the church scene.</i>

42:38.430 --> 42:43.018
<i>Despite him not being into the church,</i>
<i>it was still magical.</i>

42:43.644 --> 42:45.354
<i>We had so much in common.</i>

42:45.437 --> 42:47.856
<i>I could start a sentence,</i>
<i>and he would finish it.</i>

42:47.940 --> 42:49.191
<i>It was just unreal.</i>

42:49.275 --> 42:51.735
- <i>He was really my soulmate.</i>

42:51.819 --> 42:55.239
<i>I had found what I was looking for,</i>
<i>and it felt so good.</i>

42:57.199 --> 43:01.036
<i>It was becoming harder and harder</i>
<i>to hold out and keep him at bay.</i>

43:01.996 --> 43:04.999
- <i>I was falling, and falling hard.</i>

43:05.708 --> 43:07.793
<i>We'd talk on the phone</i>
<i>until the sun came up.</i>

43:08.377 --> 43:10.754
<i>We even fell asleep on the phone</i>
<i>a few times.</i>

43:10.838 --> 43:13.632
<i>I didn't even recognize this new person</i>
<i>that I had become,</i>

43:14.341 --> 43:17.886
<i>and when I would tell myself to slow down,</i>
<i>slow down,</i>

43:17.970 --> 43:19.680
<i>-Sarah was right there.</i>

43:19.763 --> 43:22.558
-It's your fault.
-No, no, no, no, no.

43:22.725 --> 43:24.685
Oh, I have never seen you this happy.

43:24.768 --> 43:26.395
-Mm!

43:26.478 --> 43:28.731
-Oh, girl, I am. I am.
-Uh-huh. Ooh...

43:29.732 --> 43:33.360
<i>And I was. </i>
<i>I was so happy.</i>

43:34.153 --> 43:35.779
- I'm scared.
- Do you trust me?

43:35.863 --> 43:38.699
<i> I was just about willing</i>
<i>to do anything for him.</i>

43:38.782 --> 43:41.869
<i>-</i> Do you trust me?
- Yes.<i> </i>

43:42.286 --> 43:44.872
-Yeah. What is this, baby? What is it?
-Turn around.

43:44.955 --> 43:46.373
Ooh, wait, wait, no no, no.

43:46.457 --> 43:50.544
No, I feel, like, high grass or something.
I don't wanna be bit by no snake, Shannon.

43:50.628 --> 43:52.004
Okay, okay, okay, listen.

43:52.087 --> 43:53.255
-We talked about this.
-Yes.

43:53.964 --> 43:55.549
-Yeah.
-You're judging too much.

43:55.633 --> 43:58.010
-Okay, okay, okay.
-Just feel, okay? Just feel.

43:58.302 --> 43:59.386
All right, okay.

43:59.470 --> 44:01.180
What is this, baby? What is this?

44:01.263 --> 44:03.140
-My eyes closed...
-Spin around, spin around.

44:03.223 --> 44:04.308
-My eyes closed?
-Yes.

44:04.391 --> 44:07.144
-Eyes closed, spin around.
-Okay, okay, okay.

44:07.227 --> 44:11.023
-Okay, open, open.

44:13.067 --> 44:15.611
Oh, Shannon, that's beautiful.

44:16.904 --> 44:19.281
Oh, baby, those are beautiful.

44:20.449 --> 44:22.951
Oh, my God.

44:23.035 --> 44:24.912
Look at 'em, look at 'em!

44:24.995 --> 44:28.165
Ooh!

44:28.248 --> 44:31.293
I need a jar. And you can catch 'em
and put 'em inside...

44:31.627 --> 44:32.670
What are you doin'?

44:32.753 --> 44:34.963
-Grace Waters...
- What are you doin'?

44:35.214 --> 44:36.298
...will you marry me?

44:38.425 --> 44:39.635
-Yes.
- Is that a yes?

44:39.718 --> 44:41.720
-So, come on, give it to me.

44:46.517 --> 44:48.811
<i>I said yes before I knew it.</i>

44:52.147 --> 44:54.483
<i>I couldn't resist him for some reason.</i>

44:55.234 --> 44:56.902
<i>He was electric...</i>

44:59.363 --> 45:03.075
<i>...and so good at making me feel good.</i>

45:03.659 --> 45:04.743
<i>It was incredible.</i>

45:04.827 --> 45:05.911
Why are you takin' pictures?

45:05.994 --> 45:09.873
-Move this way...
- <i>Most of my entire life lived,</i>

45:09.957 --> 45:11.250
<i>and here I was.</i>

45:12.334 --> 45:15.379
- Victoria's Secret.

45:17.047 --> 45:19.967
<i>I thought love was over for me.</i>
<i>I really did.</i>

45:20.426 --> 45:22.886
<i>Those were the happiest days of my life.</i>

45:24.179 --> 45:25.013
<i>Until...</i>

45:26.181 --> 45:28.100
Please, tell me what else happened.

45:32.646 --> 45:34.189
You know Danielle Mitchell.

45:36.233 --> 45:37.443
She died here.

45:39.862 --> 45:41.196
She was your client.

45:43.949 --> 45:46.493
Now, I know a little something about you,
Jasmine.

45:47.745 --> 45:49.329
You've never tried a case.

45:50.998 --> 45:53.459
And word around here,
when they saw you come in...

45:55.002 --> 45:57.504
was that they had sent me
the worst of the worst

45:58.088 --> 46:00.007
of the public defender's office.

46:03.719 --> 46:05.304
You don't win.

46:06.263 --> 46:07.389
You plead.

46:08.891 --> 46:10.476
That's what you do,

46:11.101 --> 46:13.312
which was, uh, fine with me.

46:15.856 --> 46:17.608
Now give me the damn pen.

46:26.450 --> 46:29.620
- <i>What, she said all that?</i>
<i>-</i> <i>Yeah, but she's right.</i>

46:29.703 --> 46:33.248
I mean, what am I doing?
I have the signed plea agreement.

46:33.332 --> 46:35.918
I'm just gonna take it
to the DA's office, you know?

46:36.668 --> 46:40.214
I just want to be done with all this.

46:41.048 --> 46:42.841
I just want to move to Brookhaven,

46:42.925 --> 46:46.595
have a bunch of babies,
and have you support the family.

46:46.678 --> 46:47.513
-Yeah, okay.
-Come on.

46:47.596 --> 46:49.556
No, that'll last maybe two weeks.

46:50.265 --> 46:52.643
-One. One.
-Yeah, probably. Probably one.

46:55.854 --> 46:58.482
I just know there's so much more
to this story, baby.

46:59.233 --> 47:00.692
I just know there is.

47:02.319 --> 47:04.446
-There is.
-Okay. Well...

47:04.947 --> 47:07.950
she told you that much, just get her
to tell you the rest of the story.

47:09.451 --> 47:11.537
No. I'm done.

47:13.205 --> 47:14.039
I'm done.

47:18.168 --> 47:19.002
No, you're not.

47:20.003 --> 47:21.421
<i>Is the plea deal done?</i>

47:21.922 --> 47:23.215
At this point...

47:24.842 --> 47:27.594
if you wanna be in here
for the rest of your life,

47:27.678 --> 47:28.971
so be it.

47:29.638 --> 47:33.016
I have your signed agreement.
I'm just waiting to take it to the DA.

47:33.100 --> 47:35.519
And you're right about me
not winning any cases,

47:36.353 --> 47:39.273
or not even trying one for that matter,
but...

47:40.941 --> 47:43.360
most of my cases were simple misdemeanors

47:44.194 --> 47:46.071
or a few felonies that I pled out.

47:46.864 --> 47:49.283
But, Grace,
I've never met anyone like you.

47:49.575 --> 47:51.076
I never met anyone

47:51.577 --> 47:53.370
that I felt, in my heart,

47:54.037 --> 47:55.163
was innocent,

47:55.581 --> 47:57.791
even though you're telling me
you're guilty.

47:59.585 --> 48:02.379
You know, Grace,
I don't know how I can help you.

48:02.462 --> 48:04.923
But if you tell me what happened...

48:06.675 --> 48:08.927
I promise you I will try.

48:10.554 --> 48:12.639
Grace, please tell me what else happened.

48:15.726 --> 48:18.312
You stopped at him
asking you to marry him.

48:20.814 --> 48:22.149
We got married.

48:23.275 --> 48:24.818
And it was a whirlwind.

48:28.488 --> 48:31.408
It was the happiest time of my life.

48:31.491 --> 48:33.994
- <i>I was in love.</i>

48:34.828 --> 48:38.790
<i>He was everything I imagined</i>
<i>and wanted in a man.</i>

48:39.333 --> 48:42.544
<i>The way he spoke, the way he touched me,</i>

48:42.628 --> 48:44.671
<i>and the way he made love to me.</i>

48:45.464 --> 48:47.549
<i>When he held me, I felt so safe.</i>

48:47.633 --> 48:49.593
<i>-I thought, "How is this possible?</i>

48:49.676 --> 48:51.678
<i>Everyone should be this happy."</i>

48:51.762 --> 48:53.055
Baby girl.

48:53.138 --> 48:55.098
<i>He was wonderful.</i>

48:56.350 --> 48:57.893
<i>The man of my dreams.</i>

48:58.352 --> 49:00.187
-Come on.
-What have you done?

49:00.270 --> 49:01.480
Ah, you know what I've done.

49:01.563 --> 49:03.565
Wait, wait, wait, let me sit up.

49:03.857 --> 49:05.525
<i>He was so nice to me.</i>

49:05.609 --> 49:07.611
Oh, wow.

49:07.694 --> 49:08.904
<i>So sweet.</i>

49:08.987 --> 49:10.322
-You're welcome.
-Thank you.

49:10.405 --> 49:12.532
- <i>So kind.</i>

49:12.991 --> 49:15.869
<i>My life went from black-and-white</i>
<i>and routine...</i>

49:15.953 --> 49:18.372
<i>-...to happy and over-the-top.</i>

49:18.455 --> 49:19.414
Hey.

49:21.375 --> 49:22.459
Hold on, hon.

49:23.210 --> 49:25.504
I heard you like red.

49:25.587 --> 49:27.547
-Yes, I do, and I love roses.
- Those are for you.

49:27.631 --> 49:30.425
And...<i> </i> this is for me.

49:30.509 --> 49:31.343
Oh, no.

49:31.593 --> 49:32.511
- Oh, yes.
-No.

49:32.594 --> 49:33.470
Oh, yes.

49:33.762 --> 49:36.098
<i>But like watching a magic show,</i>

49:36.181 --> 49:38.600
<i>-I was so in love and so blinded</i>

49:38.684 --> 49:40.519
<i>by what he was showing me in his hands</i>

49:40.602 --> 49:44.064
<i>that I never looked at</i>
<i>what he was hiding behind his back.</i>

49:44.147 --> 49:45.816
Okay, okay. Stop.

49:47.943 --> 49:49.486
These are beautiful.

49:50.070 --> 49:50.904
So are you.

49:50.988 --> 49:53.365
Thank you.

49:54.658 --> 49:56.535
<i>But for all those happy days,</i>

49:56.743 --> 49:59.037
<i>I was in for twice as much hell.</i>

50:00.330 --> 50:04.960
<i>And it all started to fall apart</i>
<i>as quickly as it began.</i>

50:24.229 --> 50:25.063
No.

50:26.815 --> 50:27.774
Not yet.

50:28.692 --> 50:30.360
Did you enjoy the fireflies?

50:31.319 --> 50:34.197
-Who are you talking to?
-No, I can't wait to see you, too.

50:37.034 --> 50:38.660
Yeah, I'll call you tomorrow.

50:39.995 --> 50:42.122
-Bye.

50:45.417 --> 50:46.626
Who were you talking to?

50:53.383 --> 50:54.259
Grace.

50:55.093 --> 50:55.927
Yeah?

51:02.100 --> 51:03.727
There's two things I don't like.

51:06.146 --> 51:06.980
Okay.

51:08.440 --> 51:10.067
One is being checked up on...

51:14.446 --> 51:16.156
and the other's being questioned.

51:20.035 --> 51:20.952
Okay.

51:23.538 --> 51:26.124
I just... I just missed you.

51:32.714 --> 51:33.757
I miss you, too.

51:50.816 --> 51:53.902
Why did he have to go downstairs
to have the conversation?

51:54.444 --> 51:56.238
<i>And then he got so defensive.</i>

51:56.613 --> 51:59.574
That's just men sometimes.
It's probably nothing.

52:00.200 --> 52:02.119
Or it could be another woman.

52:02.202 --> 52:03.495
You know what, Sarah?

52:05.038 --> 52:06.832
This all happened so fast.

52:06.915 --> 52:09.626
<i>Okay, don't go making a mountain</i>
<i>out of a molehill.</i>

52:09.709 --> 52:12.587
Okay? It's probably nothing.

52:13.171 --> 52:14.047
Miss Waters?

52:14.131 --> 52:15.841
Hold on. Yes?

52:15.924 --> 52:18.802
Mr. Clyde would like to see you
in the conference room right away, please.

52:19.386 --> 52:21.096
Okay. Thank you.

52:21.179 --> 52:22.264
Mm-hmm.

52:22.347 --> 52:25.475
-Hey, Sarah, I gotta go.
<i>-</i><i> Why you gotta go, baby?</i>

52:25.559 --> 52:28.186
- <i>My boss wants to see me.</i>
-Oh.

52:28.270 --> 52:30.105
Okay, talk to you later.

52:34.151 --> 52:35.986
<i>I thought it was strange</i>
<i>that my boss</i>

52:36.069 --> 52:39.030
<i>and all the corporate officers</i>
<i>wanted to see me in the middle of the day.</i>

52:39.114 --> 52:42.409
<i>I had no idea of the bombshell</i>
<i>he would drop.</i>

52:42.492 --> 52:44.161
Mr. Clyde, you wanted to see me?

52:45.954 --> 52:48.623
We just completed an internal audit
of your department.

52:48.707 --> 52:52.752
$379,000 is missing from your accounts.

52:52.836 --> 52:54.462
Well, there has to be some mistake.

52:54.546 --> 52:58.175
It was signed for with your company ID,
your password,

52:58.258 --> 53:00.635
your computer's IP, your laptop,

53:00.719 --> 53:02.637
your name, your codes.

53:03.096 --> 53:05.140
What is wrong with you, Grace?

53:06.141 --> 53:09.519
You thought that we wouldn't notice
that kind of money being moved?

53:09.603 --> 53:11.855
-No, Mr. Clyde, I-I never--
- You're fired!

53:12.564 --> 53:13.565
You're fired.

53:13.648 --> 53:16.067
<i>I couldn't find words to defend myself.</i>

53:16.151 --> 53:18.695
I want that money,
or you're going to jail.

53:18.778 --> 53:21.990
Now please leave
before I have security escort you out.

53:22.073 --> 53:25.577
<i> I was just so shocked</i>
<i>that he would treat me like that.</i>

53:25.660 --> 53:26.828
<i>They knew me!</i>

53:27.329 --> 53:28.705
<i>I couldn't believe this.</i>

53:28.788 --> 53:31.958
<i>I had worked for this company for years.</i>

53:32.042 --> 53:34.127
<i>It had helped me have a good life,</i>

53:34.211 --> 53:37.130
<i>and they were throwing me out</i>
<i>for something I didn't do.</i>

53:38.256 --> 53:39.758
<i>Something I would never do.</i>

53:40.717 --> 53:42.052
<i>It was horrible.</i>

53:42.844 --> 53:44.638
<i>I felt sick to my stomach.</i>

53:45.222 --> 53:48.099
<i>But little did I know</i>
<i>the worst was yet to come.</i>

53:50.518 --> 53:51.937
-He's not answering?
-No.

53:52.896 --> 53:55.899
He's probably with whoever the hell
he was talking to on the phone.

53:57.234 --> 53:58.318
I can't believe this.

53:58.818 --> 53:59.945
We just got married,

54:00.028 --> 54:01.863
and he probably with some other woman,
and I'm sitting up here,

54:01.947 --> 54:03.823
trying to figure out
what to do about this mess!

54:03.907 --> 54:05.367
Grace, Grace, come on now.

54:05.450 --> 54:07.994
Calm down,
and tell me how you think this happened.

54:08.078 --> 54:09.412
I don't know, Sarah.

54:10.705 --> 54:11.623
I don't know.

54:13.041 --> 54:14.376
-I mean,

54:14.459 --> 54:15.919
maybe somebody's trying--

54:16.920 --> 54:19.756
-Somebody stole my identity. I don't know.

54:22.676 --> 54:23.718
Hey.

54:24.427 --> 54:25.428
Where you been?

54:25.512 --> 54:27.931
-I've been calling you for hours.
-Have you?

54:28.473 --> 54:29.349
Yeah.

54:30.433 --> 54:32.394
-I was, uh--
-With your new woman?

54:34.854 --> 54:37.023
You take her to the fireflies
like you did me?

54:38.149 --> 54:39.401
Wow.

54:41.069 --> 54:43.488
Sarah, would you excuse us
for a second, please?

54:45.615 --> 54:47.284
No, I'm not going anywhere.

54:48.285 --> 54:49.869
I'd like to talk to my wife.

54:51.955 --> 54:53.873
I'm not going anywhere.

54:56.751 --> 54:57.919
So, this is what you wanna do?

54:58.003 --> 55:00.171
You wanna talk to me like this
in front of your friend?

55:01.131 --> 55:02.674
<i>Her</i> friend.

55:03.508 --> 55:05.010
And you remember that.

55:05.093 --> 55:06.720
It's all right, Sarah.

55:07.304 --> 55:08.346
You sure?

55:08.430 --> 55:09.556
Yeah.

55:10.348 --> 55:11.182
Go on.

55:12.434 --> 55:13.310
All right.

55:14.436 --> 55:15.312
Okay.

55:15.395 --> 55:17.105
-You call me.
-Yeah.

55:22.444 --> 55:23.570
So, who is she?

55:23.987 --> 55:24.821
Who is who?

55:25.280 --> 55:26.239
The woman.

55:26.698 --> 55:27.824
Did you take her?

55:28.325 --> 55:30.035
'Cause I heard you on the phone.

55:54.309 --> 55:55.810
I was talking to the nurses.

55:58.855 --> 56:00.857
The head nurse, she's 60.

56:01.441 --> 56:03.818
I set up this photo shoot with the kids.

56:04.861 --> 56:06.071
Kind of did it for you.

56:08.656 --> 56:09.949
They have cancer, Grace.

56:10.950 --> 56:13.119
I figured you'd like the shoot because...

56:14.329 --> 56:15.914
that's where I proposed to you.

56:20.960 --> 56:22.837
You know what's not gonna happen?

56:25.715 --> 56:27.592
Because we already discussed this.

56:29.928 --> 56:32.305
I'm not gonna sit here and be acc--
You know what? Fuck this.

56:32.389 --> 56:34.224
Wait, baby. I'm sorry.

56:34.307 --> 56:35.433
I'm sorry.

56:35.683 --> 56:36.559
I'm sorry.

56:38.603 --> 56:41.356
Listen, I just had one of the worst days
of my life.

56:42.273 --> 56:43.316
I got fired.

56:46.194 --> 56:47.362
-Fired?
- Yeah.

56:48.738 --> 56:50.156
I don't know what happened,

56:50.240 --> 56:53.201
but somebody got into my accounts,
they got my passwords...

56:54.494 --> 56:55.412
I don't know.

56:56.579 --> 56:59.833
-I don't know what to do.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry, baby.

57:00.834 --> 57:04.546
I mean,
I've been calling the banks all day.

57:04.629 --> 57:08.216
I-I think-- I think somebody maybe...

57:08.299 --> 57:10.093
Maybe somebody stole my identity.

57:10.176 --> 57:13.054
-Baby, I don't know what to do.
-Baby, it's okay, it's okay. Okay?

57:13.138 --> 57:14.222
Look, we're gonna handle it.

57:14.305 --> 57:15.557
-Okay.
-I'm here.

57:16.808 --> 57:17.642
I'm sorry.

57:17.725 --> 57:20.270
No, I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry this happened.

57:20.353 --> 57:22.897
We're gonna make it right.
Just tell me who call.

57:24.649 --> 57:27.819
I don't know... start t-trying to call

57:27.902 --> 57:29.988
my credit accounts
or something like that.

57:30.071 --> 57:31.614
-I don't know who all to call.
-Okay.

57:31.698 --> 57:33.366
Maybe I'll try to call the IRS.
I don't know.

57:33.450 --> 57:34.993
-We'll figure it out together.
- Okay.

57:36.035 --> 57:38.204
-This is...
-Just breathe, just breathe.

57:38.288 --> 57:40.540
-Come here, breathe.
-Thank you.<i> </i>

57:40.623 --> 57:42.667
-<i> He was so...</i>
-I'm sorry.

57:42.750 --> 57:44.419
<i>...concerned.</i>

57:44.502 --> 57:45.837
-Come on. Let's call 'em.
-Okay.

57:45.920 --> 57:46.754
We gotta get this.

57:46.838 --> 57:49.382
<i>We stayed up most of the night</i>
<i>trying to figure out what happened.</i>

57:49.466 --> 57:50.967
Who do you got? Who you got?

57:51.050 --> 57:53.261
Uh, the IRS again. Let me try...

57:53.344 --> 57:55.722
<i>The next morning,</i>
<i>I got up really early</i>

57:55.805 --> 57:56.973
<i>and called the police.</i>

57:57.515 --> 58:00.143
<i>-They were no help at all, so...</i>
-Is there anything you can do?

58:00.226 --> 58:01.394
<i>...I went to the bank.</i>

58:01.478 --> 58:03.688
I'm sorry, is this your signature?

58:03.771 --> 58:05.648
It matches your signature card.

58:05.732 --> 58:08.359
Well, it looks like mine,
but, uh, what is that?

58:08.443 --> 58:10.361
-'Cause I didn't sign it.
- Oh.

58:10.904 --> 58:13.948
We need to know when you can make
the payment on your mortgage.

58:14.407 --> 58:15.909
It's 30 days behind.

58:15.992 --> 58:16.826
What mortgage?

58:16.910 --> 58:19.537
My house has been paid for
for over four years.

58:19.621 --> 58:20.830
Well, it was,

58:20.914 --> 58:26.044
and then you took out a $375,000 mortgage

58:26.127 --> 58:27.879
exactly 42 days ago.

58:27.962 --> 58:29.339
What are you talking about?

58:29.422 --> 58:31.799
The payments were set up
as direct withdrawal,

58:31.883 --> 58:34.886
and your account is now overdrawn by...

58:34.969 --> 58:36.012
$4,600.

58:36.095 --> 58:39.015
Wait a minute.

58:41.851 --> 58:43.186
This can't be right.

58:45.313 --> 58:46.356
Wait a minute.

58:48.274 --> 58:49.442
I didn't do this.

58:49.526 --> 58:51.945
But as I was trying to tell
one of your tellers,

58:52.028 --> 58:55.823
I think that somebody
has stolen my identity.

58:56.533 --> 58:59.244
See, because how is this kind of stuff
even possible?

58:59.327 --> 59:01.871
'Cause I didn't sign this,
and I never came in here.

59:01.955 --> 59:02.872
This was not me.

59:02.956 --> 59:04.207
It was notarized.

59:04.582 --> 59:05.542
By whom?

59:06.084 --> 59:08.753
Uh... Flynch Notary.

59:08.836 --> 59:11.631
Hold on, can I just borrow this
for a minute? Excuse me.

59:11.923 --> 59:14.300
-Flynch Notary.
-Flynch Notary.

59:14.384 --> 59:15.385
-Mm-hmm.
-Um...

59:15.468 --> 59:21.558
-the address is 2989 Sycamore Street.
-2989... Sycamore Street.

59:21.641 --> 59:22.725
Lord, have mercy.

59:24.018 --> 59:25.770
What is going on?

59:25.853 --> 59:27.939
I'm sorry,
but while we look into this,

59:28.022 --> 59:31.025
we're gonna need a payment
so your house doesn't go into foreclosure.

59:31.109 --> 59:31.985
Okay.

59:33.152 --> 59:34.362
What is going on?

59:35.446 --> 59:36.990
<i>I went to Sycamore Street,</i>

59:37.615 --> 59:39.784
<i>and it was an old, abandoned house.</i>

59:40.243 --> 59:42.161
<i>The mail was piling up. It was...</i>

59:42.954 --> 59:45.582
<i>All of it was addressed to somebody</i>
<i>named A. McKathy.</i>

59:46.332 --> 59:50.461
<i>I was just upset that some stranger</i>
<i>would do this to me.</i>

59:50.545 --> 59:52.088
<i>It was horrible.</i>

59:52.171 --> 59:53.339
<i>I went back to the bank</i>

59:53.423 --> 59:55.675
<i>to get video surveillance, and...</i>
<i>and, well...</i>

59:56.843 --> 01:00:00.054
<i>That's when everything I knew shattered.</i>

01:00:05.351 --> 01:00:06.394
You did it.

01:00:09.022 --> 01:00:09.856
What?

01:00:13.901 --> 01:00:14.777
You okay?

01:00:15.737 --> 01:00:16.613
You did it.

01:00:18.031 --> 01:00:18.990
Did what?

01:00:19.324 --> 01:00:20.617
You went to my bank,

01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:23.620
and you took out a mortgage on my house.

01:00:25.121 --> 01:00:28.708
Grace...
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:00:29.375 --> 01:00:30.543
Check your cell.

01:01:02.867 --> 01:01:04.369
Grace...<i> </i>

01:01:05.787 --> 01:01:07.747
I needed the money, Grace.

01:01:09.791 --> 01:01:13.169
And what kind of man
wants to ask his woman for money?

01:01:14.128 --> 01:01:15.088
I mean, come on.

01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:19.676
I had debts that had to be paid
by some people

01:01:19.759 --> 01:01:21.678
that are not to be messed with.

01:01:22.178 --> 01:01:24.722
And I just thought
because we're partners, we're married,

01:01:24.806 --> 01:01:26.057
-so I just figured that...
-Mm-mm.

01:01:26.140 --> 01:01:27.308
you'd want me to have it.

01:01:27.392 --> 01:01:30.311
- Why don't you--
-Oh, my God.

01:01:33.022 --> 01:01:34.649
-You stole the money from my job, too.
- I did not.

01:01:34.732 --> 01:01:36.484
-Yes, you did!
-I'll pay you back. I'm gonna--

01:01:36.567 --> 01:01:37.652
My accounts?

01:01:38.486 --> 01:01:40.029
My-- My-- My passwords?

01:01:41.114 --> 01:01:42.448
You did that, Shannon?

01:01:43.282 --> 01:01:44.492
You did that.

01:01:47.161 --> 01:01:48.037
No.

01:01:48.830 --> 01:01:50.248
N-No.

01:01:52.166 --> 01:01:54.627
I want you to give me back...

01:01:55.628 --> 01:01:56.713
all that money.

01:02:00.007 --> 01:02:03.219
I can go to jail.

01:02:04.095 --> 01:02:05.847
Where-- Where is it?

01:02:06.305 --> 01:02:09.100
I need you to give me back that money.

01:02:11.185 --> 01:02:12.979
-I can't.
- What the hell?

01:02:13.062 --> 01:02:13.938
It's mine now.

01:02:14.021 --> 01:02:16.524
What the fuck are you talkin' about?

01:02:17.024 --> 01:02:18.776
Do you know the laws of this state?

01:02:20.987 --> 01:02:22.113
Because I do.

01:02:24.449 --> 01:02:26.242
And as your lawfully wedded husband,

01:02:26.325 --> 01:02:29.203
-I have every fucking right to that money!

01:02:31.873 --> 01:02:33.374
You lucky I got two phones.

01:02:34.250 --> 01:02:36.502
<i> He was talkin',</i>
<i>and I didn't hear anything.</i>

01:02:37.128 --> 01:02:38.546
<i>I couldn't believe this.</i>

01:02:39.046 --> 01:02:41.299
<i>-I had been conned.</i>

01:02:41.382 --> 01:02:43.384
<i>All of it was a lie.</i>

01:02:43.968 --> 01:02:47.221
<i>I knew it, but my brain couldn't process</i>
<i>what he had done.</i>

01:02:48.264 --> 01:02:50.767
<i>There I was with nothing.</i>

01:02:50.850 --> 01:02:53.186
<i>He had taken every bit of it,</i>

01:02:53.269 --> 01:02:55.855
<i>and I was so lost.</i>

01:02:56.355 --> 01:02:59.442
<i>How could this sweet, loving man</i>

01:02:59.525 --> 01:03:03.571
<i>become this cold, calculating demon</i>
<i>in no time?</i>

01:03:03.946 --> 01:03:07.116
<i>I was beyond hurt by the betrayal.</i>

01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:09.202
I want you out of my house.

01:03:10.119 --> 01:03:13.122
I want you out of my house,
and I want you out of my house,<i> </i> now.

01:03:13.206 --> 01:03:14.540
And I want an ashtray.

01:03:17.001 --> 01:03:18.419
You son of a bitch.

01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:25.927
<i>He was laughing at me.</i>

01:03:26.010 --> 01:03:28.888
You keep saying <i>"your </i> house."

01:03:29.138 --> 01:03:31.474
That marriage license says <i>our </i> house.

01:03:31.557 --> 01:03:33.601
<i>It was bad enough</i>
<i>that he had taken all my money,</i>

01:03:33.684 --> 01:03:34.977
<i>but here he was laughin'.</i>

01:03:35.061 --> 01:03:36.854
-You watch.
-I'm watchin'.

01:03:37.855 --> 01:03:38.898
Ashtray.

01:03:41.275 --> 01:03:42.527
Ashtray, bitch!

01:03:42.610 --> 01:03:44.153
<i>And he wouldn't leave.</i>

01:03:44.237 --> 01:03:46.531
<i>I called the police.</i>
<i>I told them everything.</i>

01:03:46.781 --> 01:03:49.951
He does not own this house,
I've owned this house for four years.

01:03:50.034 --> 01:03:52.078
<i>They told me</i>
<i>that there was nothing they could do,</i>

01:03:52.161 --> 01:03:55.414
<i>and that I needed a lawyer</i>
<i>because this was a civil matter.</i>

01:03:55.498 --> 01:03:57.834
<i>Sarah recommended a lawyer,</i>
<i>and we went to see him.</i>

01:03:57.917 --> 01:03:59.085
Ten thousand dollars?

01:03:59.168 --> 01:04:02.755
<i>The attorney told me</i>
<i>that his retainer was $10,000,</i>

01:04:02.839 --> 01:04:05.758
<i>and it could be as long as two years</i>
<i>to get to court.</i>

01:04:05.842 --> 01:04:08.052
He's already taken so much-- Sarah.

01:04:08.135 --> 01:04:09.512
<i>My hands were tied.</i>

01:04:09.595 --> 01:04:13.432
<i>I didn't know what to do.</i>
<i>I was just so outdone.</i>

01:04:13.641 --> 01:04:14.934
Oh, my God.

01:04:50.303 --> 01:04:51.262
Not yet.

01:04:59.896 --> 01:05:00.855
Mm!

01:05:07.069 --> 01:05:11.616
Shannon, get your black ass
out of my motherfucking house!

01:05:12.283 --> 01:05:13.200
I mean it!

01:05:13.284 --> 01:05:16.370
-Respect my motherfucking privacy!
-You son of a bitch! You son of a bitch!

01:05:16.454 --> 01:05:17.371
Get some goddamn locks

01:05:17.455 --> 01:05:19.373
-on these doors.
-You black-ass bastard!

01:05:19.457 --> 01:05:20.791
You son of a bitch!

01:05:21.626 --> 01:05:22.627
What?

01:05:24.462 --> 01:05:26.464
So, you brought me to your mom's house?

01:05:27.048 --> 01:05:29.800
-My momma live better than that.

01:05:29.884 --> 01:05:31.177
-Where were we?
- Come on.

01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:33.512
-Mm! Okay.
- Don't worry about it.

01:05:33.679 --> 01:05:34.889
Mm!

01:05:37.099 --> 01:05:38.726
<i>Then it washed over me.</i>

01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:42.396
<i> I went numb.</i>

01:05:45.149 --> 01:05:48.069
<i>You ever had that numb feeling?</i>

01:05:49.445 --> 01:05:51.989
<i>Like what's going on with you</i>
<i>can't be real?</i>

01:05:53.866 --> 01:05:55.242
<i>It just can't be.</i>

01:05:57.828 --> 01:06:01.415
<i>I couldn't believe that I was this age</i>

01:06:01.499 --> 01:06:03.501
<i>and I let this happen to me.</i>

01:06:05.086 --> 01:06:07.088
-That was great.
-Mm-hmm.

01:06:07.171 --> 01:06:09.215
-Will I see you again?

01:06:10.424 --> 01:06:12.718
Yeah, if your mom
don't break in on us again.

01:06:14.053 --> 01:06:15.012
She won't.

01:06:16.430 --> 01:06:20.309
<i>Was I that stupid</i>
<i>that I would let this happen?</i>

01:06:23.437 --> 01:06:24.271
<i>Not me.</i>

01:06:26.732 --> 01:06:27.984
<i>I'm educated</i>

01:06:28.943 --> 01:06:29.986
<i>and smart.</i>

01:06:33.531 --> 01:06:36.200
<i>Was I that lonely...</i>

01:06:37.743 --> 01:06:39.912
<i>...that I would let this fool</i>

01:06:39.996 --> 01:06:41.831
<i>take advantage of me?</i>

01:06:42.832 --> 01:06:44.291
<i>I didn't understand it.</i>

01:06:46.669 --> 01:06:48.254
Should've joined us.

01:06:54.719 --> 01:06:56.137
That look killed me, baby.

01:06:59.056 --> 01:07:00.016
Aw.

01:07:03.352 --> 01:07:05.354
It's kind of like
the same one you got now.

01:07:07.231 --> 01:07:09.358
Shannon, please give me my money.

01:07:11.736 --> 01:07:12.570
What?

01:07:14.989 --> 01:07:16.073
I'm looking at

01:07:16.949 --> 01:07:19.702
-being prosecuted by my job.

01:07:20.995 --> 01:07:22.913
-Grace, again with that?
-Give me my money.

01:07:22.997 --> 01:07:24.206
-Please.
-Grace, Grace, Grace,

01:07:24.290 --> 01:07:25.791
Grace, Grace, Grace, Grace.

01:07:30.171 --> 01:07:31.756
Now, the way I look at it...

01:07:35.926 --> 01:07:37.386
you owe me that money.

01:07:38.846 --> 01:07:40.848
Yeah. I mean, think about it.

01:07:42.850 --> 01:07:44.143
All the sex...

01:07:45.352 --> 01:07:48.689
and the joy I brought
to your miserable fucking life!

01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:52.234
Yeah.

01:07:54.153 --> 01:07:55.112
You owe me.

01:08:02.078 --> 01:08:02.912
I mean...<i> </i> um...

01:08:04.747 --> 01:08:05.915
I don't mean to yell.

01:08:09.335 --> 01:08:11.045
You're a nice lady, Grace.

01:08:13.547 --> 01:08:15.007
You're a very nice lady.

01:08:17.718 --> 01:08:19.595
One of the nicest I ever met, really.

01:08:24.642 --> 01:08:28.187
That's why it's been so hard for me
to do this.

01:08:33.442 --> 01:08:34.318
Yeah.

01:08:34.944 --> 01:08:37.738
I guess the nicest thing I can do
is tell you the truth.

01:08:47.122 --> 01:08:48.332
You see, I love you.

01:08:51.627 --> 01:08:53.129
I really do love you. I...

01:08:55.339 --> 01:08:58.466
I'm just never gonna love you
the same way that you love me.

01:09:05.515 --> 01:09:07.350
And women your age, you know...

01:09:08.269 --> 01:09:09.435
How's the phrase go?

01:09:10.020 --> 01:09:11.313
Low-hanging fruit.

01:09:12.564 --> 01:09:13.399
Single.

01:09:15.359 --> 01:09:16.402
Vulnerable.

01:09:18.696 --> 01:09:19.529
Lonely.

01:09:21.198 --> 01:09:22.408
Fuckin' weak.

01:09:25.828 --> 01:09:27.453
I mean, if you think about it...

01:09:29.247 --> 01:09:31.667
it's your fuckin' fault.
You made this too easy.

01:09:36.546 --> 01:09:37.590
But you don't think.

01:09:48.767 --> 01:09:49.602
Grace, I'm hun--

01:10:33.437 --> 01:10:35.981
<i>I couldn't believe that I had killed him.</i>

01:10:57.753 --> 01:10:59.964
<i>I got in my car,</i>
<i>and I just drove...</i>

01:11:01.674 --> 01:11:02.967
<i>and drove.</i>

01:11:04.093 --> 01:11:06.595
<i>Before I knew it,</i>
<i>I was in the middle of nowhere.</i>

01:11:06.679 --> 01:11:07.638
Sarah.

01:11:10.349 --> 01:11:12.309
He's in my basement.

01:11:15.437 --> 01:11:16.730
I killed him.

01:11:18.941 --> 01:11:20.985
You told Sarah you killed him?

01:11:21.318 --> 01:11:22.152
Yes.

01:11:22.236 --> 01:11:24.446
-And you didn't remove the body?
- No.

01:11:24.530 --> 01:11:26.031
I left him there.

01:11:27.616 --> 01:11:29.368
Sarah went to the house.

01:11:29.451 --> 01:11:31.287
Then she called me and told me

01:11:31.829 --> 01:11:33.205
there wasn't a body.

01:11:34.623 --> 01:11:35.666
He was gone.

01:11:36.917 --> 01:11:39.003
Wait, are you telling me he's not dead?

01:11:39.086 --> 01:11:40.838
No, I know he's dead.

01:11:41.547 --> 01:11:43.299
-But he wasn't there.

01:11:44.425 --> 01:11:45.426
Time's up.

01:11:47.928 --> 01:11:49.430
Grace, where was the body?

01:11:50.597 --> 01:11:51.932
Where was he?

01:11:53.475 --> 01:11:54.518
I don't know.

01:11:57.730 --> 01:12:00.024
<i>You didn't tell me</i>
<i>she told you she killed him.</i>

01:12:00.107 --> 01:12:02.609
You can't keep this kind of thing from me,
Sarah.

01:12:02.693 --> 01:12:03.819
I'm trying to help her,

01:12:03.902 --> 01:12:06.655
and this is the kind of information
that I need to know.

01:12:07.323 --> 01:12:08.699
So you went to her house?

01:12:09.575 --> 01:12:10.576
Yes.

01:12:11.327 --> 01:12:12.828
And what happened when you got there?

01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:19.752
There is nothing you can say
that I can use against her.

01:12:20.627 --> 01:12:21.462
Okay?

01:12:22.755 --> 01:12:24.798
It's not just her I'm worried about.

01:12:26.258 --> 01:12:27.343
Who?

01:12:28.135 --> 01:12:30.804
If you knew something
and you didn't tell the police,

01:12:31.430 --> 01:12:33.182
that's a crime, right?

01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:36.727
If the DA knew this, then, yes.

01:12:37.853 --> 01:12:39.063
You would be charged.

01:12:40.606 --> 01:12:41.648
Not me.

01:12:42.566 --> 01:12:43.984
Her son, Malcolm.

01:12:44.443 --> 01:12:45.569
He was there.

01:12:47.029 --> 01:12:47.863
Malcolm?

01:12:49.073 --> 01:12:51.325
<i>Well, did he say anything?</i>

01:12:51.950 --> 01:12:53.744
<i>Did you see anything unusual?</i>

01:12:53.827 --> 01:12:56.330
<i>He was just a little agitated, and...</i>

01:12:56.413 --> 01:12:58.957
it was quick, you know?
He-- He just drove away.

01:12:59.375 --> 01:13:01.335
Well, what happened
when you got in the house?

01:13:01.418 --> 01:13:05.047
I went down to the basement,
but there was no body there.

01:13:05.756 --> 01:13:08.884
There was just blood everywhere,
all over the basement stairs.

01:13:09.843 --> 01:13:11.387
What do you think happened?

01:13:11.470 --> 01:13:12.805
I think Malcolm...

01:13:13.931 --> 01:13:15.933
took the body before I got there...

01:13:16.850 --> 01:13:17.684
or...

01:13:20.020 --> 01:13:21.647
Or if Grace was in a state of shock,

01:13:21.730 --> 01:13:24.525
she might have dragged that body up
and put it in the back of her car,

01:13:24.608 --> 01:13:26.860
drove out to the country,
and dumped it somewhere.

01:13:26.944 --> 01:13:29.905
Mm-mm. No, no. No, no. She didn't do that.

01:13:31.448 --> 01:13:32.324
I believe her.

01:13:33.867 --> 01:13:35.786
I just love her so much.

01:13:38.455 --> 01:13:40.124
I'm sorry, Miss Sarah.

01:13:40.207 --> 01:13:42.000
I just... I...

01:13:42.084 --> 01:13:44.169
You did all you could for her, Miss Sarah.

01:13:47.464 --> 01:13:49.925
- It's all right. It's all right.
-I'm so sorry, Miss Sarah.

01:13:50.884 --> 01:13:53.178
-I'll fix it.
- Okay, okay.

01:13:54.138 --> 01:13:56.515
Now we know why she wants to plead guilty.

01:13:57.224 --> 01:13:58.100
Why?

01:13:59.518 --> 01:14:00.894
To protect her son.

01:14:03.063 --> 01:14:03.897
Oh...

01:14:07.025 --> 01:14:09.570
- Baby, you coming to bed?
-In a little bit.

01:14:09.653 --> 01:14:12.489
Oh, babe, when you get to work tomorrow,
can you look up Shannon Delong,

01:14:12.990 --> 01:14:14.450
without anybody noticing?

01:14:14.533 --> 01:14:16.034
Uh, I really shouldn't do that.

01:14:16.577 --> 01:14:17.411
Please?

01:14:20.372 --> 01:14:21.832
Okay. I'll see what I can do.

01:14:21.915 --> 01:14:23.709
-Thank you.

01:14:28.255 --> 01:14:31.175
So you see,
she's trying to protect her son and Sarah.

01:14:31.258 --> 01:14:33.260
- Mm.
- Now I need your help.

01:14:34.094 --> 01:14:35.512
Jasmine, my office.

01:14:36.889 --> 01:14:39.433
Meet me at my house at 7:00,
both of you, okay?

01:14:39.516 --> 01:14:40.642
All right.

01:14:41.226 --> 01:14:42.936
She's really gonna defend her.

01:14:43.020 --> 01:14:45.981
Yeah, not if Mr. Rory Plea-Deal
has anything to say about it.

01:14:46.064 --> 01:14:47.149
- You right.
- Hm.

01:14:47.232 --> 01:14:49.401
I got it. Thanks.

01:14:49.818 --> 01:14:51.111
That was the DA's office.

01:14:51.195 --> 01:14:53.739
You wanna tell me why they don't have
the plea from Grace Waters yet?

01:14:54.615 --> 01:14:57.534
There's been a change of events.
She doesn't want to plead guilty.

01:14:57.618 --> 01:14:59.161
She wants to try the case.

01:14:59.244 --> 01:15:01.121
She can't afford to go to trial.

01:15:01.205 --> 01:15:03.707
This office cannot afford to go to trial.

01:15:04.166 --> 01:15:06.210
What are you gonna do? You gonna plead.
It's three weeks away.

01:15:06.293 --> 01:15:07.794
Is that what you're planning on doing?

01:15:07.878 --> 01:15:08.879
-Yes.
- Ah.

01:15:09.463 --> 01:15:10.297
That's great.

01:15:10.380 --> 01:15:13.258
Now all of a sudden you want to be
this hero and you want to try a case?

01:15:13.342 --> 01:15:14.927
You're not ready. I've been watching you.

01:15:15.010 --> 01:15:16.887
I gave you this for a reason, you plea.

01:15:16.970 --> 01:15:19.556
Here's what you're gonna do.
You're gonna go down to that jailhouse,

01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:21.183
and you're gonna get her
to sign that plea,

01:15:21.266 --> 01:15:22.392
and you're gonna get it done.

01:15:23.852 --> 01:15:26.480
Never mind, I'll do it.
I'll do it. Thanks.

01:15:29.691 --> 01:15:31.902
Grace, I don't have a lot of time. Now...

01:15:31.985 --> 01:15:35.781
I think we have enough reasonable doubt
to get that into the jury's mind,

01:15:35.864 --> 01:15:37.199
and that means an acquittal.

01:15:37.824 --> 01:15:39.409
Did the DA take the deal?

01:15:39.493 --> 01:15:41.495
No, no, no. No, listen to me.

01:15:42.037 --> 01:15:45.457
I know Sarah and your son
were at the house the day he died.

01:15:45.541 --> 01:15:47.000
Who told you that?

01:15:48.043 --> 01:15:49.419
This is my mess.

01:15:49.503 --> 01:15:53.507
I dragged them into this,
and I will not let my son go to jail.

01:15:53.590 --> 01:15:55.425
Did your son help you get rid of the body?

01:15:55.509 --> 01:15:58.428
No, he did not,
and don't you ever ask me that again.

01:15:58.595 --> 01:16:00.264
Okay, look,
my boss is gonna walk

01:16:00.347 --> 01:16:01.640
into that door any minute,

01:16:01.723 --> 01:16:04.434
and I need you to tell him
that you have changed your mind,

01:16:04.518 --> 01:16:05.769
and you do not want a plea.

01:16:05.852 --> 01:16:10.315
The only thing I asked the DA to do
was to put me in a prison close to my son,

01:16:10.399 --> 01:16:12.025
and you want me to jeopardize that? No!

01:16:12.109 --> 01:16:14.486
-But what if you go free?
-You can't do that.

01:16:14.570 --> 01:16:17.406
Yeah, I know I can't
if you don't let me fight for you!

01:16:17.614 --> 01:16:19.908
Please, let me fight for you!

01:16:20.534 --> 01:16:22.536
-I can do it.

01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:28.834
Jasmine, I had a feeling you'd be here.

01:16:28.917 --> 01:16:29.751
Hi.

01:16:31.128 --> 01:16:33.797
My name is Rory Garraux.
I'm Jasmine's boss.

01:16:34.381 --> 01:16:37.342
And I think that she's been giving you
some misleading information.

01:16:38.093 --> 01:16:39.094
I'd like you to understand something.

01:16:39.177 --> 01:16:41.221
My office has looked at your case
up and down,

01:16:41.305 --> 01:16:44.641
and we think a plea is a good idea.
That way, you can be near your son.

01:16:44.725 --> 01:16:46.602
I know that's important to you, yes?

01:16:47.811 --> 01:16:50.314
So my purpose here today is to find out

01:16:50.397 --> 01:16:52.941
if it's still your intention
to plead guilty.

01:16:57.029 --> 01:16:59.781
Miss Waters,
is it your intention to plead guilty?

01:17:02.743 --> 01:17:04.077
I wanna go to court.

01:17:24.431 --> 01:17:26.099
I know you talked her into this.

01:17:27.100 --> 01:17:28.644
When you lose this case,

01:17:29.603 --> 01:17:33.231
I promise you,
you're fired, and your career's over.

01:17:39.738 --> 01:17:41.990
Hope I don't lose my job,
but I ran him, and he's clean.

01:17:42.074 --> 01:17:45.827
Damn it. He's a con artist.
He probably has several different aliases.

01:17:45.911 --> 01:17:50.415
Well, okay. Uh, do you know any of them,
or do you have fingerprints or something?

01:17:51.083 --> 01:17:52.584
Oh, my God. Um...

01:17:53.335 --> 01:17:56.380
Try this. It's a long shot,
but see what happens.

01:17:56.463 --> 01:17:59.508
Okay. Babe, I was kidding, but great.
Another thing to get me fired.

01:17:59.925 --> 01:18:01.134
Thanks, babe. Okay.

01:18:01.385 --> 01:18:03.470
Um... I'm gonna call Sarah to the stand.

01:18:04.179 --> 01:18:05.722
I don't know, that could be tricky.

01:18:05.806 --> 01:18:07.391
The DA doesn't know that she called her.

01:18:07.474 --> 01:18:09.476
But if he's good,
he could potentially get it out of her.

01:18:09.559 --> 01:18:11.770
No, no, no. No. She's strong.

01:18:11.853 --> 01:18:13.271
- I don't know, Jasmine.
-She's strong.

01:18:13.355 --> 01:18:14.773
That's, uh, really risky.

01:18:14.856 --> 01:18:16.817
I need to establish
that she's a good person,

01:18:16.900 --> 01:18:18.985
and what better person to do that
than her best friend?

01:18:19.069 --> 01:18:20.195
-Right?
-Yeah.

01:18:20.487 --> 01:18:23.323
-Yeah, that's true.
-I-I don't know. I don't know anymore.

01:18:24.783 --> 01:18:28.453
Well, what else do we have
besides blood pooling and no body? Huh?

01:18:30.497 --> 01:18:33.250
Okay. All we need is reasonable doubt.

01:18:34.251 --> 01:18:35.377
Okay, let's just start again.

01:18:35.460 --> 01:18:37.671
This is the third time we've started.
Look, there's nothing here.

01:18:37.754 --> 01:18:38.880
Okay? There's no smoking gun.

01:18:38.964 --> 01:18:41.758
Well, we need to find enough
circumstantial evidence to become one.

01:18:45.971 --> 01:18:46.805
What?

01:18:48.598 --> 01:18:50.392
Nothing. The fire.

01:18:50.934 --> 01:18:51.893
We love it.

01:18:52.477 --> 01:18:54.438
- I'll start again.
-I'm gonna take this file, Jasmine.

01:18:54.521 --> 01:18:55.605
You get the phone records.

01:19:02.696 --> 01:19:04.156
Opening statements.

01:19:09.828 --> 01:19:11.496
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury.

01:19:11.830 --> 01:19:16.126
Today, we are gonna prove,
without a reasonable doubt,

01:19:16.918 --> 01:19:17.753
that this woman...

01:19:19.296 --> 01:19:21.298
Grace Anne Waters,

01:19:21.798 --> 01:19:26.219
murdered Shannon DeShawn Delong
in cold blood.

01:19:27.637 --> 01:19:28.555
How'd she do it?

01:19:30.348 --> 01:19:31.975
Well, she took a baseball bat,

01:19:32.684 --> 01:19:33.560
like this one...

01:19:34.728 --> 01:19:37.773
and she beat him to death.

01:19:39.441 --> 01:19:42.444
Not only that, the evidence
is gonna show how she did it.

01:19:42.736 --> 01:19:44.863
The motive will show why she did it.

01:19:45.822 --> 01:19:46.865
And it's up to you

01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:50.660
to show what happens to people
who break the law.

01:19:51.244 --> 01:19:55.040
People like Grace Anne Waters
who are cold-blooded killers.

01:19:56.041 --> 01:19:57.292
People with no regard...

01:19:58.210 --> 01:19:59.419
for human life.

01:20:00.754 --> 01:20:03.256
You have a chance, at this time,

01:20:04.216 --> 01:20:07.177
to take Grace Anne Waters, a murderer...

01:20:08.553 --> 01:20:10.806
off the streets forever.

01:20:17.312 --> 01:20:18.355
Mrs. Bryant?

01:20:24.986 --> 01:20:26.613
Mrs. Bryant.

01:20:27.864 --> 01:20:29.616
Opening statements?

01:20:43.213 --> 01:20:45.382
You've heard the prosecution assert

01:20:46.216 --> 01:20:49.177
that there is evidence to prove
that she is guilty.

01:20:50.470 --> 01:20:51.930
Well, we want you to know...

01:20:52.889 --> 01:20:56.393
that that same evidence will prove

01:20:56.476 --> 01:20:58.728
that she is not guilty.

01:20:59.271 --> 01:21:02.649
Grace Waters is not a cold-blooded killer.

01:21:02.732 --> 01:21:04.317
She's a grandmother.

01:21:04.818 --> 01:21:07.028
She feeds the homeless.

01:21:07.487 --> 01:21:09.531
She teaches Sunday school.

01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:11.783
She bakes cookies.

01:21:13.034 --> 01:21:14.160
Just look at her.

01:21:14.703 --> 01:21:15.579
Look at her.

01:21:16.246 --> 01:21:17.706
This is a nightmare for her,

01:21:18.290 --> 01:21:22.460
and as it can be for anyone
who is on trial for murder

01:21:22.544 --> 01:21:23.670
and is innocent.

01:21:24.504 --> 01:21:26.506
Grace loved her husband,

01:21:26.590 --> 01:21:29.593
and she did not cause his disappearance.

01:21:29.676 --> 01:21:31.761
And the reason I say "disappearance"

01:21:31.845 --> 01:21:34.806
is because the evidence will show
that there is, not now,

01:21:34.890 --> 01:21:38.518
nor has there ever been,
any evidence that a murder happened.

01:21:38.602 --> 01:21:40.979
No body found.

01:21:41.855 --> 01:21:44.774
That's because she did not murder him.

01:21:46.484 --> 01:21:48.278
Beyond reasonable doubt.

01:21:49.696 --> 01:21:53.783
That's the conclusion you need to get past
in order to reach a verdict.

01:21:55.243 --> 01:21:57.287
There are a lot of doubts here.

01:21:58.955 --> 01:22:00.749
And they're all beyond reasonable.

01:22:02.459 --> 01:22:03.293
You'll see.

01:22:05.086 --> 01:22:06.004
You'll see.

01:22:09.007 --> 01:22:10.175
Wow, that was good.

01:22:10.300 --> 01:22:11.843
Mm. Don't doubt her.

01:22:11.927 --> 01:22:14.679
It'll be a lot easier
when she stops doubting herself.

01:22:15.055 --> 01:22:16.097
Call your first witness.

01:22:16.181 --> 01:22:18.725
Prosecution calls
Detective Marshall Thomas.

01:22:19.142 --> 01:22:21.102
Do you solemnly affirm
that you will tell the truth,

01:22:21.186 --> 01:22:24.439
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth
under the pains and penalties of perjury?

01:22:24.522 --> 01:22:26.316
-I do.
- Detective Thomas...

01:22:27.192 --> 01:22:30.820
were you the officer that was called
to 1828 Bruben Lane?

01:22:30.904 --> 01:22:31.738
Yes.

01:22:31.821 --> 01:22:33.239
Did you find a body?

01:22:33.323 --> 01:22:34.532
No, we didn't.

01:22:34.616 --> 01:22:37.410
So you assumed that this was blood loss.

01:22:37.911 --> 01:22:39.746
No assumption, we have DNA testing.

01:22:39.829 --> 01:22:43.333
Well, can your DNA test determine
when that blood was left there?

01:22:43.416 --> 01:22:45.210
No, the stains were cleaned up.

01:22:45.293 --> 01:22:48.421
So it's a possibility that the blood
could have been left there over time?

01:22:49.547 --> 01:22:51.007
I suppose, but that's not--

01:22:51.091 --> 01:22:53.468
Like over several different times
to add up to that same amount?

01:22:54.719 --> 01:22:55.720
That's highly unlikely.

01:22:55.804 --> 01:22:56.972
I didn't ask if it was likely,

01:22:57.055 --> 01:22:59.808
I asked was it reasonably possible that
that could happen?

01:23:01.059 --> 01:23:03.395
Yes. Anything's possible.

01:23:04.270 --> 01:23:05.689
No further questions.

01:23:06.147 --> 01:23:07.440
The blood spatter.

01:23:07.524 --> 01:23:10.735
Is that normal in this position
for blunt force trauma?

01:23:11.444 --> 01:23:12.278
Yes.

01:23:12.988 --> 01:23:15.365
See, so when I looked at this, I saw--

01:23:15.448 --> 01:23:17.534
Objection, Your Honor.
Is there a question here?

01:23:17.617 --> 01:23:18.827
Sustained.

01:23:21.329 --> 01:23:23.164
So the trajectory of the blood

01:23:23.248 --> 01:23:26.584
could have been from something hitting it
after it was already there?

01:23:27.544 --> 01:23:28.420
Yes.

01:23:29.254 --> 01:23:30.422
No further questions.

01:23:32.257 --> 01:23:35.093
Do you remember where you were
the night of August the 17th?

01:23:35.176 --> 01:23:37.387
Do you use illegal narcotics?

01:23:37.637 --> 01:23:39.431
So you worked with Mr. Delong?

01:23:39.931 --> 01:23:41.933
Did you find him to be
a responsible young man?

01:23:42.017 --> 01:23:43.226
Have you slept with him, ma'am?

01:23:43.309 --> 01:23:44.978
- Objection.
-Sustained.

01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:48.231
When he asked to take your picture,
was he flirty?

01:23:48.314 --> 01:23:50.942
- Did you let him?
-Objection, Your Honor, move to strike.

01:23:51.026 --> 01:23:52.652
- On what grounds?
- Your Honor--

01:23:52.736 --> 01:23:54.320
Don't make me warn you again.

01:23:54.404 --> 01:23:56.406
Did you meet him there
in the store?

01:23:57.032 --> 01:23:58.408
Did you know he was married?

01:23:58.491 --> 01:24:00.910
How many men have you seen her
in church with?

01:24:00.994 --> 01:24:02.829
Was she affectionate with these men?

01:24:02.912 --> 01:24:03.913
Objection, Your Honor.

01:24:03.997 --> 01:24:05.123
Overruled.

01:24:06.332 --> 01:24:07.417
<i>How we doing?</i>

01:24:07.834 --> 01:24:10.420
Well, the prosecutor
is blowing us out the water.

01:24:11.629 --> 01:24:13.465
Now, you know I did not call your son.

01:24:14.215 --> 01:24:15.050
Thank you.

01:24:15.216 --> 01:24:17.719
But Sarah I can call to the stand,

01:24:18.428 --> 01:24:22.390
and, um, I can raise reasonable doubt
by simply asking if she killed Shannon.

01:24:22.474 --> 01:24:23.475
-Listen--
- No.

01:24:24.100 --> 01:24:26.770
Now, you don't listen, do you?
That is my friend.

01:24:27.645 --> 01:24:30.148
Grace, I really feel like
we have an in there

01:24:30.231 --> 01:24:31.483
-if we can just--
- Jasmine.

01:24:31.566 --> 01:24:35.737
Do it, and I promise you, I will stand up
and scream I did it, that I'm guilty.

01:24:36.112 --> 01:24:38.865
Okay.

01:24:40.283 --> 01:24:41.117
All right.

01:24:54.130 --> 01:24:57.550
Wow, the prosecution has
some unbelievably strong witnesses.

01:24:57.634 --> 01:24:59.469
-I know.
-So what are you gonna do?

01:24:59.552 --> 01:25:01.179
I have to call Sarah to the stand.

01:25:01.262 --> 01:25:04.182
Mmm, Jasmine, if you don't go after her
and give the jury something--

01:25:04.265 --> 01:25:05.391
Don't you think I know that?

01:25:05.475 --> 01:25:07.519
Okay, but you need her to be
more than just a character witness.

01:25:07.602 --> 01:25:09.646
I know that, too.
And I can't go left on her,

01:25:09.729 --> 01:25:10.688
or Grace'll lose it.

01:25:10.772 --> 01:25:13.650
And I can't ask her about Shannon
and Grace's relationship,

01:25:13.733 --> 01:25:16.736
because that'll give the prosecution
another motive. I got it, Donnie.

01:25:16.820 --> 01:25:17.654
Okay?

01:25:17.904 --> 01:25:18.738
Okay.

01:25:19.030 --> 01:25:20.657
You know I'm just trying to help, right?

01:25:21.241 --> 01:25:22.325
-Thanks.
- Yes, ma'am.

01:25:26.454 --> 01:25:27.664
Babe, sleep.

01:25:28.498 --> 01:25:29.541
I can't.

01:25:30.333 --> 01:25:31.417
It's gonna be fine.

01:25:31.835 --> 01:25:32.669
It will.

01:25:33.086 --> 01:25:35.296
I just hope Sarah doesn't blow it.

01:25:36.422 --> 01:25:38.800
Well, you, Donnie,
and Tilsa prepped her, right?

01:25:39.217 --> 01:25:40.051
Yeah, but...

01:25:42.720 --> 01:25:44.472
-she's all I have.
- Mm.

01:25:45.598 --> 01:25:48.184
Stop stressing.
I'm gonna be off early tomorrow.

01:25:48.268 --> 01:25:51.229
I'm gonna get there as soon as I can.
I'm gonna watch you knock it out, okay?

01:25:53.022 --> 01:25:53.898
Now, go to sleep.

01:25:57.193 --> 01:25:58.278
<i>Miss Miller,</i>

01:25:58.736 --> 01:26:02.323
can you tell the court
about your relationship with Grace?

01:26:05.535 --> 01:26:06.703
We're best friends.

01:26:08.413 --> 01:26:10.331
And how close are you two?

01:26:11.374 --> 01:26:14.377
She's like the sister I never had.

01:26:16.921 --> 01:26:19.841
And how long
have you known each other, Miss Miller?

01:26:20.675 --> 01:26:21.676
For six years.

01:26:22.886 --> 01:26:25.096
And in that time of knowing her,
Miss Miller,

01:26:25.638 --> 01:26:29.767
have you ever seen Grace violent or angry?

01:26:30.393 --> 01:26:32.729
Oh, no. Oh, no.

01:26:33.271 --> 01:26:36.774
She's not a violent person,
even when she should be.

01:26:36.858 --> 01:26:38.234
What do you mean by that?

01:26:39.277 --> 01:26:42.655
I have seen people be very mean to Grace,

01:26:42.739 --> 01:26:44.574
and she just prayed for them.

01:26:45.283 --> 01:26:48.536
Now, the prosecution wants us to believe,
Miss Miller,

01:26:48.620 --> 01:26:52.081
that Grace is a cold-blooded murderer.

01:26:52.165 --> 01:26:54.167
- Objection.
- Sustained.

01:26:54.626 --> 01:26:56.794
I'm not gonna warn you again,
Mrs. Bryant.

01:26:56.878 --> 01:26:58.421
Ask a question.

01:27:02.175 --> 01:27:03.218
Miss Miller,

01:27:03.551 --> 01:27:05.178
is Grace capable

01:27:05.261 --> 01:27:08.014
of murdering someone?

01:27:10.308 --> 01:27:13.144
G-Grace? Oh, no. No, no.

01:27:13.686 --> 01:27:15.980
She would never hurt anyone. She wouldn't.

01:27:16.397 --> 01:27:19.525
Is she capable of beating someone
with a bat?

01:27:21.069 --> 01:27:22.487
Absolutely not.

01:27:24.197 --> 01:27:25.406
No further questions.

01:27:25.907 --> 01:27:28.534
- Thank you, Miss Miller.

01:27:33.248 --> 01:27:34.207
Miss Miller,

01:27:34.290 --> 01:27:36.834
you say the two of you were close friends?

01:27:37.627 --> 01:27:38.503
Yes.

01:27:38.586 --> 01:27:41.130
So would she call you
when she was in trouble?

01:27:41.214 --> 01:27:42.048
No.

01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:45.051
- She wouldn't?
-I mean, yes.

01:27:45.134 --> 01:27:46.427
Yes, she would.

01:27:46.928 --> 01:27:48.304
Well, did she call you
on the...

01:27:48.388 --> 01:27:50.348
the night in question, August 17th?

01:27:52.058 --> 01:27:53.017
Uh...

01:27:55.603 --> 01:27:58.147
-I know you want to protect your friend.
-Objection, Your Honor.

01:27:58.231 --> 01:27:59.565
Sustained.

01:28:00.525 --> 01:28:02.860
Miss Miller,
you are under oath to tell the truth.

01:28:02.944 --> 01:28:06.030
Did she call you the night of August 17th?

01:28:08.700 --> 01:28:11.494
Uh...  Yes.

01:28:11.953 --> 01:28:13.705
What did you talk about?

01:28:14.455 --> 01:28:16.332
How we were gonna feed the homeless.

01:28:16.874 --> 01:28:18.710
What exactly did she say?

01:28:18.918 --> 01:28:21.504
Just that she was excited about it, and...

01:28:22.005 --> 01:28:25.341
we talked about her son, Malcolm,
for a while.

01:28:26.092 --> 01:28:26.968
Hmm.

01:28:27.051 --> 01:28:28.678
How long did you speak?

01:28:30.013 --> 01:28:31.306
About 15 minutes.

01:28:33.308 --> 01:28:34.434
Okay. Well...

01:28:35.518 --> 01:28:38.146
the, uh, phone record shows that

01:28:38.730 --> 01:28:42.150
the two of you talked
for less than two minutes.

01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:43.443
Is that about right?

01:28:43.526 --> 01:28:44.360
Objection!

01:28:45.737 --> 01:28:46.904
On what grounds?

01:28:46.988 --> 01:28:49.615
This particular phone record
was not in discovery.

01:28:50.199 --> 01:28:51.034
Approach.

01:28:56.914 --> 01:28:59.584
Your Honor, the defense was not given
this phone record.

01:28:59.667 --> 01:29:01.669
Your Honor,
if you look at the list of documents,

01:29:01.753 --> 01:29:03.004
it's on discovery.

01:29:03.087 --> 01:29:05.256
But, Your Honor, we did not get this
in discovery,

01:29:05.340 --> 01:29:08.051
this particular phone record,
nor have we had the time to.

01:29:08.134 --> 01:29:11.929
It says here that they were given
months ago.

01:29:13.890 --> 01:29:16.392
Well, I was just given this case
three weeks ago, and there was--

01:29:16.476 --> 01:29:19.479
Your Honor, we can't be held responsible
for Miss Bryant's incompetence here.

01:29:19.562 --> 01:29:20.396
She had them.

01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:21.939
You may continue.

01:29:22.023 --> 01:29:23.274
Thank you, Your Honor.

01:29:24.984 --> 01:29:26.152
But, Your Honor, if we can--

01:29:26.235 --> 01:29:28.905
Welcome to trial, Mrs. Bryant.

01:29:29.364 --> 01:29:30.615
Now, step away.

01:29:45.129 --> 01:29:45.963
Okay.

01:29:47.799 --> 01:29:48.883
Where was I?

01:29:50.343 --> 01:29:51.344
Phone records.

01:29:52.595 --> 01:29:53.679
Now, they show...

01:29:54.263 --> 01:29:57.058
that you spoke for less than two minutes,
right?

01:29:58.184 --> 01:30:00.436
I-I really don't remember.

01:30:00.520 --> 01:30:01.854
It's been so long ago.

01:30:01.938 --> 01:30:04.399
Well, maybe you remember
what you did after the call.

01:30:04.482 --> 01:30:05.525
What did you do?

01:30:06.025 --> 01:30:08.861
Well, it was late, so I went to bed.

01:30:09.529 --> 01:30:12.490
Well, then why was your cell phone used

01:30:13.116 --> 01:30:14.867
and pinged to a cell tower

01:30:14.951 --> 01:30:16.911
near Grace's home a few moments later?

01:30:18.037 --> 01:30:20.331
I-I... I don't recall.

01:30:20.415 --> 01:30:22.667
Her phone records show
an incoming call from you.

01:30:22.750 --> 01:30:24.168
Did you call her?

01:30:25.253 --> 01:30:27.588
Miss Miller, you made it very clear
earlier in your testimony

01:30:27.672 --> 01:30:28.923
that you two are friends.

01:30:29.549 --> 01:30:31.175
I understand, you care for her deeply.

01:30:31.759 --> 01:30:34.262
-Are you covering for her now?
-No.

01:30:34.345 --> 01:30:36.431
Then can you please clear up
these phone records?

01:30:36.514 --> 01:30:38.891
She lives in Rotwell County.
It's very rural.

01:30:38.975 --> 01:30:42.228
She called you once, you called her twice.
Why?

01:30:42.311 --> 01:30:44.564
-I don't remember.
- It's on the phone records.

01:30:44.647 --> 01:30:46.899
She called you, you spoke
for less than two minutes.

01:30:46.983 --> 01:30:49.652
Then you went to her house,
you called her,

01:30:49.735 --> 01:30:50.987
then you were at your house.

01:30:51.070 --> 01:30:53.406
You called her again 45 minutes later.
Why?

01:30:53.906 --> 01:30:54.907
I don't remember.

01:30:54.991 --> 01:30:58.744
Miss Miller, do you understand
that you can be put in jail for perjury?

01:30:58.828 --> 01:31:00.621
You do know what perjury is, right?

01:31:06.586 --> 01:31:07.503
Your Honor...

01:31:10.840 --> 01:31:12.341
The witness will answer.

01:31:14.677 --> 01:31:17.680
She told me that she killed him.

01:31:21.184 --> 01:31:22.852
I'm sorry, Grace.

01:31:27.064 --> 01:31:28.232
No further questions.

01:31:32.862 --> 01:31:34.489
Mrs. Bryant, your witness.

01:31:36.532 --> 01:31:38.075
No further questions, Your Honor.

01:31:38.159 --> 01:31:39.118
Okay.

01:31:39.952 --> 01:31:40.912
You may step down.

01:31:44.790 --> 01:31:47.877
Is the defense resting, Mrs. Bryant?

01:31:48.544 --> 01:31:49.795
The defense rests.

01:31:50.671 --> 01:31:52.965
Closing arguments in the morning
at 9:00 a.m.

01:31:53.049 --> 01:31:54.133
-We're adjourned.

01:31:54.217 --> 01:31:55.551
All rise.

01:32:01.724 --> 01:32:03.351
-You tried.

01:32:22.245 --> 01:32:24.080
How could you miss the phone records?

01:32:25.998 --> 01:32:26.958
I, um...

01:32:27.959 --> 01:32:29.335
I didn't see them, sir.

01:32:29.418 --> 01:32:30.253
I, um...

01:32:31.587 --> 01:32:33.798
I thought I saw them,
but I didn't-- I didn't see them,

01:32:33.881 --> 01:32:36.008
and I was just completely overwhelmed.

01:32:36.092 --> 01:32:37.009
-I--
-Overwhelmed.

01:32:37.093 --> 01:32:38.803
You didn't see 'em? I saw 'em.

01:32:38.886 --> 01:32:41.514
'Cause I was shadowing you.
I was watching it all along.

01:32:42.098 --> 01:32:47.770
I don't get it. I...
...I just sit in that office for 25 years,

01:32:47.853 --> 01:32:49.438
watching people like you come in,

01:32:49.522 --> 01:32:52.149
then go out to private practice,
go to other firms, make more money,

01:32:52.233 --> 01:32:55.236
but I respect it.
I'm insulted by your callous demeanor.

01:32:56.153 --> 01:32:57.363
You know what you just did?

01:32:57.446 --> 01:32:59.949
This is 101.
You let a witness leave the stand

01:33:00.032 --> 01:33:01.617
saying that your client was a murderer.

01:33:03.119 --> 01:33:04.161
That's what you did.

01:33:04.829 --> 01:33:07.039
That's what they're gonna think about
all night long.

01:33:10.126 --> 01:33:11.043
I don't get it.

01:33:13.921 --> 01:33:16.924
I guess it's a millennial thing.
I'll never understand it.

01:33:44.660 --> 01:33:46.329
Baby, come on, just eat a little bit.

01:33:48.372 --> 01:33:49.415
Please, come on.

01:33:49.498 --> 01:33:52.668
I don't want it!
Who are you, my father? I don't want it!

01:34:03.054 --> 01:34:03.971
I'm sorry.

01:34:05.514 --> 01:34:06.349
Okay?

01:34:08.392 --> 01:34:11.354
I'm just really stressed right now,

01:34:11.937 --> 01:34:13.397
and I know you're upset,

01:34:13.981 --> 01:34:16.067
but you heard the way he talked to me.

01:34:16.651 --> 01:34:19.111
-Why didn't you say something?
-'Cause he made a lot of good points.

01:34:19.945 --> 01:34:21.030
I don't like the way he said it,

01:34:21.113 --> 01:34:23.783
but he was telling you the truth, Jasmine.
The truth hurts sometimes.

01:34:25.409 --> 01:34:26.243
Wow.

01:34:27.536 --> 01:34:30.623
-I can't believe you're taking his side.
-I'm not on his side, baby.

01:34:30.706 --> 01:34:32.124
I'm on your side, I'm on our side.

01:34:32.208 --> 01:34:33.834
I'm on whatever's going
to make you better.

01:34:34.293 --> 01:34:35.127
Truth is hard to get,

01:34:35.211 --> 01:34:36.962
but it can make you strong
if you just let it.

01:34:37.046 --> 01:34:39.048
-You are such an ass.
- I'm not the ass.

01:34:39.131 --> 01:34:40.508
-You are such an ass!
-I'm not the ass.

01:34:40.591 --> 01:34:42.760
-I don't walk away when things get hard.
-Are you serious?

01:34:42.843 --> 01:34:44.929
-Yeah, I'm dead serious.
-Really?

01:34:45.012 --> 01:34:47.473
You can't keep running away
your whole life

01:34:47.556 --> 01:34:48.933
hiding behind plea deals, Jasmine.

01:34:49.016 --> 01:34:52.353
I was trying! That's the reason
why I'm trying this case.

01:34:52.436 --> 01:34:54.355
Okay, so somebody says something
that sets you back,

01:34:54.438 --> 01:34:55.606
and you just walk away, babe.

01:34:55.690 --> 01:34:57.149
-The case is lost!
-No, it's not.

01:34:57.233 --> 01:34:58.359
You saw the jury!

01:34:58.442 --> 01:35:01.237
-What am I supposed to do?
-You're supposed to do your job, babe!

01:35:02.029 --> 01:35:03.030
Till the end!

01:35:03.114 --> 01:35:05.700
I'm serious, the job you were born to do.
That's...

01:35:05.783 --> 01:35:06.617
Baby.

01:35:07.243 --> 01:35:10.329
I saw the fire in your eyes
when you started this case,

01:35:10.413 --> 01:35:12.623
and I saw it just go away
as soon as this moment happened.

01:35:12.707 --> 01:35:13.916
Just find it again.

01:35:16.085 --> 01:35:17.128
It's done.

01:35:17.628 --> 01:35:19.088
The case is closed.

01:35:19.171 --> 01:35:21.173
All that's left is the closing argument.

01:35:21.549 --> 01:35:22.800
There's nothing I can do.

01:35:22.883 --> 01:35:25.261
Well, you better write
one hell of a closing argument.

01:35:25.344 --> 01:35:26.220
Hmm?

01:35:30.474 --> 01:35:31.934
I'm tired.

01:35:32.601 --> 01:35:33.436
Babe.

01:35:39.650 --> 01:35:42.445
You've heard the testimony
of over 45 witnesses

01:35:42.528 --> 01:35:44.363
that have attested to her guilt.

01:35:44.864 --> 01:35:47.867
Her own best friend said
she told her that she killed him.

01:35:48.534 --> 01:35:50.202
She knew her better than anyone.

01:35:50.286 --> 01:35:53.247
Miss Waters killed Shannon Delong,

01:35:53.330 --> 01:35:56.500
and she dragged his body
out to a swamp in the country,

01:35:56.917 --> 01:35:58.169
never to be found again.

01:35:59.086 --> 01:36:00.171
That's cold-blooded.

01:36:00.838 --> 01:36:02.131
That is calculated.

01:36:02.214 --> 01:36:04.550
That is premeditated murder.

01:36:05.509 --> 01:36:07.636
And it's your job to bring her to justice.

01:36:07.845 --> 01:36:08.929
It is your job

01:36:09.013 --> 01:36:12.016
to find her guilty,
and we have the utmost faith in you,

01:36:12.099 --> 01:36:14.018
and our legal system, that you will.

01:36:15.227 --> 01:36:16.103
Thank you.

01:36:20.065 --> 01:36:21.108
Mrs. Bryant?

01:36:24.278 --> 01:36:25.738
Mrs. Bryant.

01:36:27.323 --> 01:36:28.324
Are you okay?

01:36:31.702 --> 01:36:33.454
The defense calls Sarah Miller.

01:36:33.954 --> 01:36:36.290
Your Honor, both sides rested yesterday.

01:36:36.373 --> 01:36:37.917
Approach the bench.

01:36:44.381 --> 01:36:45.966
Your Honor, both sides rested.

01:36:46.050 --> 01:36:48.844
I understand the counsel is a novice here.
This is ridiculous.

01:36:48.928 --> 01:36:51.555
Hold on, Counsel. Mrs. Bryant,

01:36:51.639 --> 01:36:55.226
you do understand
that both sides have rested?

01:36:55.309 --> 01:36:56.435
Yes, I do, Your Honor,

01:36:56.519 --> 01:36:59.563
but I would like to recall Miss Miller
to the stand.

01:36:59.647 --> 01:37:01.982
On what grounds?

01:37:02.650 --> 01:37:05.945
I should have questioned her
after she said what she said,

01:37:06.237 --> 01:37:08.155
and I should not have rested,

01:37:08.239 --> 01:37:10.282
and I would like to question her again
because--

01:37:10.366 --> 01:37:13.327
That's not how this works.

01:37:13.410 --> 01:37:17.373
Once you rest, you cannot call a witness.

01:37:17.456 --> 01:37:19.041
Just take it up in appeal.

01:37:19.333 --> 01:37:21.001
Closing arguments right now.

01:37:21.085 --> 01:37:23.087
-But, Your Honor, if I could just--
- Ah!

01:37:23.754 --> 01:37:25.714
Step back and argue.

01:37:27.466 --> 01:37:29.176
Now, Counselor.

01:37:40.396 --> 01:37:42.648
-The defense calls Sarah Miller.
-Your Honor...

01:37:42.731 --> 01:37:45.276
Mrs. Bryant, I have already ruled on that,

01:37:45.359 --> 01:37:46.902
and I will not tolerate any more--

01:37:46.986 --> 01:37:48.153
Take the stand, Miss Miller.

01:37:48.612 --> 01:37:50.781
-Take the stand.
- Mrs. Bryant!

01:37:51.532 --> 01:37:53.200
Miss Miller, sit back down.

01:37:53.284 --> 01:37:54.952
You are not taking the stand.

01:37:55.035 --> 01:37:57.413
Counselors, in my chambers now.

01:37:57.496 --> 01:37:59.248
I will not be going
to Your Honor's chambers

01:37:59.331 --> 01:38:02.126
-until Miss Miller takes the stand.
-I have ruled on the matter,

01:38:02.209 --> 01:38:04.753
and you will come to my chambers.

01:38:04.837 --> 01:38:08.382
I'm not going into Your Honor's chambers
until Miss Miller takes the stand.

01:38:08.799 --> 01:38:11.343
-Miss Miller, take the stand, please.
- Mrs. Bryant,

01:38:11.427 --> 01:38:14.805
if you do not come into my chambers
right now,

01:38:15.639 --> 01:38:19.268
I will hold you in contempt.

01:38:21.395 --> 01:38:23.689
The defense calls Sarah Miller
to the stand.

01:38:23.772 --> 01:38:25.983
Bailiff.

01:38:29.153 --> 01:38:30.905
-Can you believe this?

01:38:37.453 --> 01:38:39.079
So what the hell was that?

01:38:39.163 --> 01:38:40.456
The hell do you care?

01:38:40.539 --> 01:38:41.832
I'm fired anyway.

01:38:43.417 --> 01:38:46.754
Yeah, that's true.
So you throw your life away anyway?

01:38:49.048 --> 01:38:50.382
That's what you wanted, isn't it?

01:38:52.009 --> 01:38:53.010
What I wanted?

01:38:53.093 --> 01:38:54.136
Mm-hmm.

01:38:54.219 --> 01:38:56.555
-No.
-And if that's what it takes.

01:38:57.181 --> 01:38:58.641
She shouldn't go to jail.

01:38:59.016 --> 01:38:59.975
This is unfair.

01:39:00.059 --> 01:39:02.311
Unfair, unfair. That's the word.

01:39:03.729 --> 01:39:04.813
Now you get it.

01:39:04.897 --> 01:39:07.816
All of this is unfair.
The law can be unfair, but it was your job

01:39:07.900 --> 01:39:10.277
to walk into that courtroom
and make it fair.

01:39:10.361 --> 01:39:12.529
- But instead, what'd you do?

01:39:12.613 --> 01:39:14.990
Go to court half-assed
after you convinced this woman

01:39:15.074 --> 01:39:16.825
to not take a great plea deal?

01:39:17.451 --> 01:39:19.995
Now look, it's all unfair.

01:39:20.079 --> 01:39:22.748
Listen, I love this personal conviction
that you got going on right now,

01:39:22.831 --> 01:39:24.208
but it's on the wrong side of time.

01:39:24.291 --> 01:39:27.753
The judge is gonna make you sit here
until you apologize.

01:39:27.836 --> 01:39:28.879
You think that's something,

01:39:28.963 --> 01:39:32.007
he gave us a recess so that
<i>we</i> can do your closing arguments.

01:39:32.091 --> 01:39:33.425
Donnie is thrilled.

01:39:33.509 --> 01:39:36.220
You weren't gonna get a mistrial.
What the hell were you thinking?

01:39:38.305 --> 01:39:39.473
Enjoy your time here.

01:39:40.599 --> 01:39:41.475
Hey, Rory.

01:39:43.018 --> 01:39:43.852
Yeah?

01:39:44.937 --> 01:39:45.980
Fuck you.

01:39:50.442 --> 01:39:52.236
Passion behind bars.

01:39:53.153 --> 01:39:53.988
Nice.

01:39:58.617 --> 01:39:59.952
We, the jury,

01:40:00.035 --> 01:40:02.621
find Grace Waters, the defendant,

01:40:02.705 --> 01:40:06.500
guilty of murder as charged
by the state of Virginia.

01:40:20.597 --> 01:40:21.890
I'm all right, baby.

01:40:23.684 --> 01:40:24.685
I'm all right.

01:40:25.644 --> 01:40:27.896
-It's okay, I got him.
- Sarah.

01:40:28.272 --> 01:40:30.399
- It's okay, I got him.
-Thank you.

01:40:32.026 --> 01:40:33.110
It's all right.

01:40:35.320 --> 01:40:36.405
Is that an Uzo?

01:40:36.488 --> 01:40:38.949
Got this in Africa. One of a kind.

01:40:42.286 --> 01:40:44.038
I got him. It's okay.

01:40:50.002 --> 01:40:52.796
<i> You will not believe</i>
<i>what your photographer did.</i>

01:40:52.880 --> 01:40:54.715
Do you need me to drive you?

01:40:55.174 --> 01:40:56.884
<i> 'Cause you are going.</i>

01:41:00.596 --> 01:41:02.139
Guard!

01:41:02.222 --> 01:41:04.558
You want to talk to me like that
in front of your friend?

01:41:05.059 --> 01:41:06.393
<i>Her </i> friend.

01:41:08.854 --> 01:41:09.938
Guard!

01:41:10.773 --> 01:41:12.524
I need to call my lawyer.

01:41:12.608 --> 01:41:15.277
<i> The verdict</i>
<i>in the Grace Waters case is guilty.</i>

01:41:15.360 --> 01:41:17.654
<i>Sentencing is scheduled</i>
<i>in just a few months.</i>

01:41:18.197 --> 01:41:21.950
<i>This turn of events is no shock to anybody</i>
<i>who was in the courtroom today</i>

01:41:22.034 --> 01:41:22.868
<i>or the jurors.</i>

01:41:22.951 --> 01:41:24.536
<i>This was what was expected.</i>

01:41:24.620 --> 01:41:28.082
<i>Grace was expected to be convicted,</i>
<i>and nothing changed here today.</i>

01:41:35.089 --> 01:41:37.633
<i>...predict that some sort</i>
<i>of plea deal is in the works.</i>

01:41:43.931 --> 01:41:47.559
Baby, tell the judge that you're sorry
so we can go home, please.

01:41:49.686 --> 01:41:50.938
<i>Looking at our forecast,</i>

01:41:51.021 --> 01:41:52.898
<i>we have a bunch of rain</i>
<i>coming this afternoon.</i>

01:41:52.981 --> 01:41:55.859
<i>This season, we haven't had</i>
<i>abnormally high amounts of rain...</i>

01:41:55.943 --> 01:41:56.944
You okay?

01:41:59.905 --> 01:42:00.781
Yeah.

01:42:04.034 --> 01:42:05.160
Yeah, I'm okay.

01:42:05.410 --> 01:42:06.995
You sure you want to see
Sarah today, babe?

01:42:07.079 --> 01:42:08.080
It's just...

01:42:08.914 --> 01:42:09.873
Yeah, I should.

01:42:10.290 --> 01:42:11.375
You know.

01:42:12.626 --> 01:42:15.170
I know she's feeling
just as bad as I am right now.

01:42:17.756 --> 01:42:19.466
-Babe, just pull over right here.
-Right now?

01:42:19.842 --> 01:42:22.469
Yeah. I can walk the rest of the way.

01:42:22.553 --> 01:42:23.762
-You sure?
-Yeah.

01:42:23.846 --> 01:42:25.305
And you gotta get back to work.

01:42:26.014 --> 01:42:27.057
You sure, babe?

01:42:28.392 --> 01:42:29.393
It's about to rain.

01:42:29.643 --> 01:42:30.686
No, I'll be fine.

01:42:32.146 --> 01:42:33.105
Okay. Love you.

01:42:34.064 --> 01:42:34.940
I love you, too.

01:42:35.023 --> 01:42:36.817
-Be safe, all right?
-I will.

01:42:37.568 --> 01:42:38.819
-Bye.
-Bye, baby.

01:42:39.361 --> 01:42:41.071
- I'll see you at home.
-All right.

01:42:56.461 --> 01:42:57.337
Hi.

01:42:57.713 --> 01:42:59.006
Hi, I know you.

01:42:59.882 --> 01:43:01.258
Hey, where are you going?

01:43:01.341 --> 01:43:02.301
I gotta go.

01:43:02.384 --> 01:43:04.094
No, no, no. Come on, come on.

01:43:04.178 --> 01:43:05.846
-Where are you going?
-I gotta get away!

01:43:05.929 --> 01:43:08.348
Oh, okay,
let's go back to Miss Sarah's house.

01:43:08.432 --> 01:43:10.475
Come on, it's okay.
Does she know you're out here?

01:43:10.559 --> 01:43:13.729
She go to the bank today.
It's the first. Bye.

01:43:13.812 --> 01:43:16.773
Okay. Well, let's-- let's go back
to Miss Sarah's house.

01:43:16.857 --> 01:43:19.067
It's all right. She probably
doesn't even know you're out here.

01:43:19.151 --> 01:43:20.986
-Let's go. Let's get you out this rain.
-No.

01:43:21.445 --> 01:43:25.282
No, don't... don't make me go back there.
Please don't.

01:43:25.365 --> 01:43:28.702
-Come on, it's okay. It's okay. I got you.
- No.

01:43:28.785 --> 01:43:31.163
-You're with me now.
-I want to go to my house.

01:43:32.080 --> 01:43:33.165
My house.

01:43:33.248 --> 01:43:34.833
-Your house?
- Yeah, uh...

01:43:35.167 --> 01:43:38.003
Come on. It's okay. I got you.

01:43:38.629 --> 01:43:41.381
-Let's go in to get some--
-Don't make me go in no more.

01:43:41.465 --> 01:43:43.467
I don't want to stay there no more.

01:43:43.926 --> 01:43:46.303
Don't make me go back there. Please don't.

01:43:46.386 --> 01:43:47.304
Come on.

01:43:47.721 --> 01:43:48.805
You're safe now.

01:43:49.723 --> 01:43:51.642
You left the door wide open.

01:43:51.934 --> 01:43:54.186
Well, I don't have all the keys.

01:43:55.520 --> 01:43:57.481
All the keys? Oh, okay.

01:43:57.981 --> 01:43:59.149
Just come on in.

01:44:01.902 --> 01:44:04.196
You're at Miss Sarah's house.
This is where you live.

01:44:04.279 --> 01:44:06.823
-This is your house, it's okay.
-No, no. No.

01:44:06.949 --> 01:44:10.953
I... I want to go to m-my own house.

01:44:11.328 --> 01:44:14.665
My... my house is... is...

01:44:14.748 --> 01:44:15.666
It's all right.

01:44:15.999 --> 01:44:17.751
Let me get you some water, okay?

01:44:19.628 --> 01:44:26.009
My house is two... 2989 Sycamore Street.

01:44:26.093 --> 01:44:27.886
-Sycamore Street?
- Yeah.

01:44:27.970 --> 01:44:29.972
That's where I live.

01:44:30.055 --> 01:44:34.893
The address is 2989 Sycamore Street.

01:44:35.602 --> 01:44:37.396
2989 Sycamore Street.

01:44:38.230 --> 01:44:39.773
I don't wanna die here like...

01:44:40.607 --> 01:44:45.654
Gloria, and... and... Brenda, and...
and Shane.

01:44:46.113 --> 01:44:48.448
Shane jumped off the roof.

01:44:48.532 --> 01:44:50.450
Jumped off the roof, dear.

01:44:50.534 --> 01:44:53.120
-I have nothing! Nothing!

01:44:53.203 --> 01:44:54.788
No!

01:44:59.960 --> 01:45:01.670
She was a photographer.

01:45:02.671 --> 01:45:05.424
And so, so talented.

01:45:05.507 --> 01:45:07.259
Oh, my God. Is, um...

01:45:08.343 --> 01:45:10.178
Is this... is this Shane's work?

01:45:13.307 --> 01:45:14.850
Yes, yes. Yes.

01:45:15.934 --> 01:45:17.185
<i>Seeing the world</i>

01:45:17.269 --> 01:45:20.939
through the eyes of a 35-millimeter,
there's nothing like that.

01:45:22.190 --> 01:45:23.734
Somebody got into my accounts.

01:45:23.817 --> 01:45:25.444
They got my passwords.

01:45:27.112 --> 01:45:29.865
You know, I-I was gonna go to my house

01:45:30.365 --> 01:45:33.535
and call the police
so they could come and help us.

01:45:35.704 --> 01:45:39.541
I had to build my own boat first.

01:45:39.624 --> 01:45:40.834
Ain't that a fact?

01:45:41.543 --> 01:45:44.254
I mean, I can't help everybody.

01:45:50.677 --> 01:45:52.220
They're hungry.

01:45:56.516 --> 01:45:57.392
Okay.

01:45:57.476 --> 01:45:58.727
You stay here.

01:45:59.853 --> 01:46:02.147
Stay here. I'll be right back, okay?

01:46:04.024 --> 01:46:05.067
Stay right here.

01:46:14.117 --> 01:46:16.828
-You have the right to remain silent.
<i>-</i> <i>Officer Bryant?</i>

01:46:17.245 --> 01:46:18.830
Go for Bryant. Come back, Walt.

01:46:18.914 --> 01:46:21.083
<i>You won't believe this.</i>
<i>Check your computer.</i>

01:46:22.167 --> 01:46:23.543
Stay right here. don't move.

01:46:33.345 --> 01:46:34.638
Oh, shit!

01:47:33.572 --> 01:47:35.782
Help me. Help me.

01:47:56.344 --> 01:47:58.180
Hello, Alice.

01:48:00.765 --> 01:48:02.434
I... I didn't let her in.

01:48:02.642 --> 01:48:03.852
Please don't hurt me.

01:48:22.662 --> 01:48:23.663
You got her?

01:48:34.299 --> 01:48:37.093
- Ooh.

01:48:40.639 --> 01:48:42.474
Some people never learn.

01:48:44.142 --> 01:48:45.143
Do they?

01:48:46.228 --> 01:48:47.687
My mama's talking to you.

01:48:50.232 --> 01:48:52.609
But they gonna learn to mind
their own damn business.

01:49:05.455 --> 01:49:07.332
- Police, open up!

01:49:07.415 --> 01:49:09.834
Jordan!

01:49:09.918 --> 01:49:11.044
Police, open up!

01:49:12.128 --> 01:49:15.549
This is Officer Bryant,
location 2342 West Lesson Lane,

01:49:15.632 --> 01:49:17.926
requesting backup. Police, open up!

01:49:18.009 --> 01:49:19.261
<i>We're seven minutes out.</i>

01:49:20.470 --> 01:49:22.347
- Open up, ma'am, police.
-Hello?

01:49:22.430 --> 01:49:25.475
- Yes, open up.
-All right. All right. Hello.

01:49:25.934 --> 01:49:26.977
Yes, hello.

01:49:27.060 --> 01:49:28.103
I'm looking for my wife.

01:49:28.520 --> 01:49:29.354
Who's your wife?

01:49:29.437 --> 01:49:30.355
You know who she is.

01:49:30.438 --> 01:49:33.275
Jasmine Bryant, she was representing
your friend Grace Waters?

01:49:33.358 --> 01:49:36.361
-She said she was gonna come by here.
-Well, I haven't seen her.

01:49:36.653 --> 01:49:37.988
Okay, well, you mind if I come in?

01:49:38.071 --> 01:49:39.322
Do you have a warrant?

01:49:39.739 --> 01:49:41.658
If you don't have a warrant,
you can't come in.

01:49:41.741 --> 01:49:43.326
I told you, she's not here.

01:49:43.910 --> 01:49:45.036
She's not here.

01:49:54.296 --> 01:49:55.547
Jesus.

01:49:57.882 --> 01:49:58.800
Jasmine!

01:50:00.719 --> 01:50:01.678
Jasmine!

01:50:01.761 --> 01:50:03.096
Where's my wife?

01:50:03.513 --> 01:50:04.514
Jasmine!

01:50:19.070 --> 01:50:20.071
Okay, okay.

01:50:20.989 --> 01:50:22.532
No, no.

01:50:27.287 --> 01:50:28.455
Okay, don't move.

01:50:29.289 --> 01:50:31.166
Don't move.

01:50:33.251 --> 01:50:34.252
Stay right here.

01:50:43.470 --> 01:50:44.429
Jasmine!

01:50:48.725 --> 01:50:49.851
Jasmine!

01:50:57.692 --> 01:50:58.735
Jasmine!

01:51:01.029 --> 01:51:01.905
Jasmine?

01:51:03.907 --> 01:51:04.824
Jasmine!

01:51:07.077 --> 01:51:08.286
Oh, baby.

01:51:46.032 --> 01:51:46.991
Stop!

01:51:56.334 --> 01:51:58.169
Jasmine, give it to me. Here.

01:51:59.546 --> 01:52:01.631
I think he's done. He's done.

01:52:03.425 --> 01:52:05.135
<i>What we've learned is that</i>
<i>Shannon Delong,</i>

01:52:05.218 --> 01:52:06.594
<i>whose real name is Maurice Mills,</i>

01:52:06.678 --> 01:52:09.639
and his mother, Betty Mills,
also known as Sarah Miller,

01:52:09.723 --> 01:52:11.266
have been kidnapping elderly women,

01:52:11.349 --> 01:52:14.644
taking their wealth and holding them
hostage for their social security.

01:52:14.728 --> 01:52:16.730
Now he's wanted in nine states for bigamy

01:52:16.813 --> 01:52:19.107
and several other crimes,
including racketeering.

01:52:19.190 --> 01:52:20.191
And we've also discovered

01:52:20.275 --> 01:52:23.361
that not only were these two
holding the elderly women hostage,

01:52:23.445 --> 01:52:27.407
but he's wanted in several states
for conning at least 16 middle-aged women

01:52:27.490 --> 01:52:28.491
that we can verify.

01:52:28.575 --> 01:52:31.786
Now, the mother-and-son duo
have been at this for over 25 years,

01:52:31.870 --> 01:52:34.622
stealing millions from their victims
over this time period.

01:52:34.706 --> 01:52:36.916
<i>Grace Waters was one of the victims.</i>

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.043
In light of the new evidence
we received,

01:52:39.127 --> 01:52:42.964
the state of Virginia wishes to apologize
to Miss Waters,

01:52:43.047 --> 01:52:44.883
and you are free to go.

01:53:07.322 --> 01:53:09.365
<i>We are working on finding out</i>
<i>what happened</i>

01:53:09.449 --> 01:53:11.326
to the fortunes of these women.

01:53:11.409 --> 01:53:13.077
Grace Waters' public defender,

01:53:13.161 --> 01:53:16.539
Jasmine Bryant, is the reason
this entire scheme was uncovered.

01:53:17.749 --> 01:53:19.751
- Miss Waters--
-Here they come. Here they come.

01:53:22.337 --> 01:53:23.797
- Okay.
- Miss Waters.

01:53:25.381 --> 01:53:27.634
Miss Waters, how does it feel to be free?

01:53:28.051 --> 01:53:28.885
Wonderful.

01:53:30.053 --> 01:53:32.096
Miss Waters, are you glad it's over?

01:53:33.973 --> 01:53:35.058
It ain't over.

01:53:36.893 --> 01:53:37.811
Excuse me.

01:53:39.854 --> 01:53:44.067
At present, Sarah Miller,
rather, Betty Mills, is still on the run.

01:53:45.443 --> 01:53:48.363
<i> So what kind of experience</i>
<i>do you have working with the elderly?</i>

01:53:48.446 --> 01:53:49.781
<i> I take care of them.</i>

01:53:50.532 --> 01:53:51.449
And I love them

01:53:52.116 --> 01:53:53.868
just like they're my own family.

01:53:54.828 --> 01:53:56.621
Well, come, I want you to meet my mother.

01:53:56.704 --> 01:53:58.164
I'd like that.

01:53:58.248 --> 01:53:59.415
What's her name again?

01:53:59.499 --> 01:54:01.501
-LuAnn.
- LuAnn.

01:54:01.584 --> 01:54:03.837
Oh, I think I read about her.

01:54:04.128 --> 01:54:06.297
Didn't she work
with some financial institution?

01:54:06.798 --> 01:54:09.050
-Oh, yeah, she did.
- Hmm.

01:54:09.133 --> 01:54:10.635
What was her position again?

01:54:10.718 --> 01:54:13.429
-She was a manager for ten years.
-Oh, my.

01:54:13.513 --> 01:54:15.014
Impressive.
