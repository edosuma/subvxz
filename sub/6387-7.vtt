Previously on <i>Californication...</i>

00:01.944 --> 00:05.153
My ex-wife is looking
for a new nanny for our son.

00:05.282 --> 00:08.482
Any interest?

00:08.484 --> 00:10.285
- You like that?
- No, Charlie!

00:10.287 --> 00:12.093
Hey, we could watch a movie
or something.

00:12.095 --> 00:15.243
- Inappropriate, Charlie.
- Right, that.

00:15.245 --> 00:16.311
How's Becca?

00:16.312 --> 00:18.621
Boyfriend.
I wanna kill him, Hank.

00:18.623 --> 00:21.359
A young, good-looking guy,
swoops in, starts sniffing

00:21.361 --> 00:23.531
around your one-and-only,
and you question his motives.

00:23.533 --> 00:26.142
But I really like your daughter.

00:26.144 --> 00:27.746
- He's you.
- What are you talking about?

00:27.748 --> 00:29.848
The kid's a loathsome,
fucking asshole.

00:29.850 --> 00:32.219
I'd like to introduce you
to Richard Bates.

00:32.220 --> 00:33.455
Haven't touched the stuff
since Slick Willie

00:33.457 --> 00:34.727
was in the White House.

00:34.729 --> 00:36.797
- Richard.
- Baby. Come on up, honey!

00:36.799 --> 00:38.399
Stop it.

00:38.401 --> 00:39.801
Tyler switched drinks,
thought it'd be funny

00:39.803 --> 00:40.968
to watch him get drunk.

00:40.970 --> 00:43.003
Jesus, that kid really is a young me.

00:43.005 --> 00:44.638
Want me to go after him?

00:44.640 --> 00:46.473
No, I don't.
Just let him run it off.

00:46.475 --> 00:48.509
Hey, can I come in?

00:48.511 --> 00:50.882
It's Richard, you know,
he won't stop drinking.

00:50.884 --> 00:53.218
I think I made
a terrible mistake, you know?

01:24.933 --> 01:26.400
Oh, fuck!

01:28.237 --> 01:29.570
Oh, fuck, please tell me we didn't.

01:29.572 --> 01:31.005
I can't tell you that.

01:31.007 --> 01:32.640
- Oh, my God.
- I-I-I won't tell you that.

01:32.642 --> 01:33.975
- Y-y-you don't remember?
- No.

01:33.977 --> 01:35.643
- Anything?
- No.

01:35.645 --> 01:36.944
Of course we did.

01:36.946 --> 01:38.179
It was pretty epic stuff, too.

01:38.181 --> 01:40.181
It was like a goddamn sex opera.

01:40.183 --> 01:43.818
Your aria was beautiful, by the way.

01:43.820 --> 01:46.087
Oh, my God, this is so fucked up.

01:46.089 --> 01:48.923
Yeah...and not even
remotely true.

01:48.925 --> 01:50.725
- Really?
- Gimme a break, lady.

01:50.727 --> 01:52.427
I didn't even lay a hand on you.

01:52.429 --> 01:54.830
Do you really think I'd take
advantage of a married woman

01:54.832 --> 01:57.200
in such a sorry state?

01:57.202 --> 01:58.969
That's not very nice.

01:58.971 --> 02:02.274
Oh, God, all I remember is, like...

02:02.276 --> 02:03.742
having a couple of drinks
and then--

02:03.744 --> 02:05.711
Which, for you, is like the equivalent

02:05.713 --> 02:08.014
of getting totally blotto.

02:08.015 --> 02:11.286
I know--

02:11.288 --> 02:12.587
- No--
- Come on.

02:12.589 --> 02:14.824
Give me a little tongue
for being good!

02:14.826 --> 02:16.559
Thank you, thank you
for not taking advantage

02:16.561 --> 02:20.464
of me when I'm sure
you totally could have.

02:20.466 --> 02:22.935
Now you tell me.

02:24.404 --> 02:27.273
Whoa.
Batesy?

02:27.275 --> 02:29.676
What the fuck, dude?

02:29.678 --> 02:33.946
Hank.

02:33.948 --> 02:37.016
Talk to me, buddy.
Use your words.

02:37.018 --> 02:38.284
Quietly.

02:38.286 --> 02:40.686
Hank, I woke up
in a strange woman's bed.

02:40.688 --> 02:42.255
Oh.

02:42.257 --> 02:45.224
I mean, she was naked, Hank.

02:45.226 --> 02:47.026
Incredibly naked.

02:47.028 --> 02:50.396
I got it.

02:50.398 --> 02:52.332
I can't find my wedding ring.
I'm fucked!

02:52.334 --> 02:54.201
Shh!
Inside voice.

02:54.203 --> 02:58.272
I can't go home
and face Karen like this.

02:58.274 --> 03:01.476
Been there.

03:01.478 --> 03:03.245
Why don't we do this?

03:05.682 --> 03:08.218
Hey, Batesy.
Batesy, stay.

03:08.220 --> 03:11.588
Stay.

03:14.059 --> 03:16.627
Hey, did I hear someone crying?

03:16.629 --> 03:18.096
Oh, yeah, that's just Charlie.

03:18.098 --> 03:19.330
- Oh, my God--
- No, he's fine.

03:19.332 --> 03:20.398
He cries a lot, wouldn't you?

03:20.400 --> 03:22.668
Let's go to see--

03:22.670 --> 03:24.002
You wanna go grab some breakfast?

03:24.004 --> 03:25.704
Uh, no. N-n-no.
Not hungry.

03:25.706 --> 03:27.106
- No?
- Tummy troubles, actually.

03:27.108 --> 03:29.375
Too much booze and marital woe.

03:29.377 --> 03:31.310
Yeah, it was like watching
a very special episode

03:31.312 --> 03:32.812
of <i>Real Housewives</i> of somewhere lame.

03:32.814 --> 03:34.313
- I--
- Yeah...

03:34.315 --> 03:35.615
I think you should go, Karen.

03:35.617 --> 03:36.749
I think you gotta go.

03:36.751 --> 03:38.150
What? Wha--

03:38.152 --> 03:40.986
No. I-I just kind of figured
you'd wanna hang out

03:40.988 --> 03:42.521
- for a while--
- Oh, all right, all right.

03:42.523 --> 03:45.291
So I'm like some lovelorn puppy,
you throw me a bone,

03:45.293 --> 03:47.660
I'm supposed to roll over,
lick my balls, and fetch?

03:47.662 --> 03:48.895
Is that it?

03:48.897 --> 03:50.430
Well, maybe next time, Karen.

03:50.432 --> 03:52.232
Peace be with you.

03:57.239 --> 03:58.873
Off you go.

04:02.945 --> 04:04.646
Batesy!

04:12.290 --> 04:22.890

<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

04:56.698 --> 04:57.897
Pretty grim, Batesy.

04:57.899 --> 04:59.566
How the fuck did you end up here?

04:59.568 --> 05:01.368
Ah, I just remember
drinking myself blind,

05:01.370 --> 05:03.703
getting into a cab.

05:03.705 --> 05:07.341
Told the guy to take me to
a fucking strip club,

05:07.343 --> 05:10.376
and after that, it's just
a blur of titties and beer.

05:12.680 --> 05:14.480
Oh, shit.
This way.

05:19.385 --> 05:21.186
Oh, God.
Oh, God.

05:21.188 --> 05:22.387
Hello?

05:22.389 --> 05:25.690
Oh, hey. Hey!

05:25.692 --> 05:28.159
Bates!

05:28.161 --> 05:31.495
You snuck out on me,
you tricky little dicky, you!

05:31.497 --> 05:32.830
She knows my name, Hank.

05:32.832 --> 05:34.165
Yes, indeed, she does...

05:34.167 --> 05:37.669
And she appears to have
your wedding ring, too.

05:37.671 --> 05:39.772
You know, I'm going to be, uh, sick.

05:39.774 --> 05:40.773
Uh, may I--

05:40.775 --> 05:41.774
Oh, you know where the bathroom is.

05:41.776 --> 05:42.975
Down the hall and to the left.

05:42.977 --> 05:45.144
That's where I shot you up last night!

05:45.146 --> 05:49.816
I'm just kidding.

05:49.818 --> 05:51.751
- Hank.
- Oh, Holly.

05:51.753 --> 05:53.453
Holly. Okay.
So, uh...

05:53.455 --> 05:56.389
What's it gonna take if the man
needs his wedding ring back?

05:56.391 --> 05:58.492
Oh, well, I mean, I understand,

05:58.494 --> 06:01.694
and I'm totally sympathetic,
but he did pay me with it.

06:01.696 --> 06:03.863
The guy went to town in the VIP room.

06:03.865 --> 06:06.065
Dance after dance after dance.

06:06.067 --> 06:10.268
I shook my moneymaker to an
entire album for him.

06:10.270 --> 06:11.769
Guns n' Roses.
<i>Appetite.</i>

06:11.771 --> 06:13.604
- Great album, great album.
- The best.

06:13.606 --> 06:17.074
Lost my cherry to it.
Front and back.

06:17.076 --> 06:19.343
Hmm.

06:19.345 --> 06:21.946
How much...
Is it gonna--

06:26.285 --> 06:28.920
Come on.

06:28.922 --> 06:31.523
- These are 20s.
- I know. Come on.

06:31.525 --> 06:34.193
Okay.
That's it.

06:34.195 --> 06:36.229
Not a dollar more.
That's what I'm owed.

06:36.231 --> 06:37.731
Mm-hmm.

06:37.733 --> 06:39.266
Can I ask you a question?

06:39.268 --> 06:40.400
Sure thing, Hank.

06:40.402 --> 06:42.536
Did you guys, uh,
you know--

06:42.538 --> 06:43.771
- Fuck?
- Yeah.

06:43.773 --> 06:45.806
What do you think, I'm a slut?

06:45.808 --> 06:49.677
You think just because
I dance naked for money,

06:49.679 --> 06:50.811
- that I'm an easy lay?
- No.

06:50.813 --> 06:52.213
Oh, really?

06:52.215 --> 06:53.848
Well, no, actually.

06:53.850 --> 06:57.085
We came back here,
we brewed some mint tea,

06:57.087 --> 06:59.153
curled up on the sofa,

06:59.155 --> 07:01.689
and watched some British television.

07:01.691 --> 07:03.758
<i>Return to Cranford.</i>
Have you seen it?

07:03.760 --> 07:05.993
- Oh, it's a real treat.
- Hmm.

07:05.995 --> 07:08.629
Of course we fucked!
The guy's an animal.

07:09.900 --> 07:11.766
Come on.

07:11.768 --> 07:12.968
Did he wear a rubber?

07:12.970 --> 07:14.936
Oh, no glove, no love.
That's my policy.

07:14.938 --> 07:17.372
That's a solid policy.

07:26.482 --> 07:28.584
- Hi, Charlie.
- Hi, Lizzie.

07:28.586 --> 07:29.752
Can I come in?

07:29.754 --> 07:32.355
Ooh, do you think it's appropriate?

07:32.357 --> 07:33.556
In this case, yes.

07:33.558 --> 07:35.492
I just wanted
to say good-bye.

07:35.494 --> 07:36.727
Good-bye?
What are you talking about?

07:36.729 --> 07:38.662
You just said hello.

07:38.664 --> 07:41.899
Marcy let me go.

07:41.901 --> 07:43.034
Really?

07:43.036 --> 07:46.638
As in, fired you?
Why?

07:46.640 --> 07:50.876
Well, it's a long story, but...

07:50.878 --> 07:52.277
Basically, she thinks I was trying

07:52.279 --> 07:55.447
- to seduce her husband.
- Were you?

07:55.449 --> 07:57.715
Stu's not exactly my type, Charlie.

07:57.717 --> 08:01.351
He has a very big penis.
Seriously.

08:01.353 --> 08:04.021
It's like a pile of snakes
with an apple on top.

08:04.023 --> 08:05.989
That's disgusting, Charlie.

08:05.991 --> 08:10.960
Very.
So, what happened?

08:10.962 --> 08:13.863
Well, Stuart was taking a nap,
and it was so hot in the hills.

08:13.865 --> 08:15.464
I thought I'd go for a swim.

08:15.466 --> 08:18.801
They're always encouraging me
to use their pool.

08:18.803 --> 08:21.437
I didn't have a bathing suit.

08:21.439 --> 08:23.406
Continue...please.

08:23.408 --> 08:27.111
But no one was home.

08:46.332 --> 08:48.099
Mr. Beggs,
I am so sorry!

08:48.101 --> 08:49.900
Stuart's asleep, and I thought
I was here alone.

08:49.902 --> 08:52.836
No apologies, dear.

08:52.838 --> 08:54.938
You have a magnificent body.

08:56.608 --> 09:00.444
And call me Stu.

09:00.446 --> 09:03.947
- So, you were naked.
- Completely.

09:03.949 --> 09:06.583
And I think he must've said
something to Marcy,

09:06.585 --> 09:08.619
and she thought it was inappropriate.

09:08.621 --> 09:10.354
And then suddenly,
she started screaming,

09:10.356 --> 09:13.657
and I was fired.
Charlie?

09:17.295 --> 09:19.063
You let me see what I can do.

09:19.065 --> 09:20.664
I'll--I'll go talk to them.

09:20.666 --> 09:23.467
Thank you, Charlie, you're a dream.

09:23.469 --> 09:28.472
Now, just so I'm clear,
you were totally naked?

09:28.474 --> 09:29.973
- Yes, Charlie.
- Okay.

09:29.975 --> 09:32.075
Good.
Got it.

09:32.077 --> 09:35.078
Yeah. Um, do you mind terribly
if I use your shower?

09:35.080 --> 09:37.748
It's just--I feel so dirty
and disgusting after all this.

09:37.750 --> 09:41.886
No problem at all!
Be my guest.

09:44.523 --> 09:45.890
- Um--
- Yes.

09:45.892 --> 09:48.125
I'll be totally naked
in your shower Charlie.

09:48.127 --> 09:49.060
Excellent!

09:54.767 --> 09:57.102
Fuck it, I gotta know.
Did she say what happened?

09:57.104 --> 09:58.302
Who?

09:58.304 --> 10:00.505
- The stripper, goddamn it!
- Ah, yeah.

10:00.507 --> 10:02.140
Right, the stripper.
You really wanna know?

10:02.142 --> 10:05.210
No! But I gotta know what
I'm dealing with here.

10:05.212 --> 10:07.980
Like, if I cheated
on this woman, this...

10:07.982 --> 10:11.049
incredible fucking goddess
of a woman, my queen--

10:11.051 --> 10:13.818
I gotta come clean, Hank.

10:13.820 --> 10:15.820
She's been through too much.

10:15.822 --> 10:17.121
No offense.

10:17.123 --> 10:20.691
Some taken.

10:20.693 --> 10:24.427
All right, well this
is what she told me.

10:24.429 --> 10:27.396
She said she brought you home,
and she was down for anything.

10:27.398 --> 10:29.932
And you were tempted,
but you fought her off.

10:30.936 --> 10:32.002
Said you were in love with your wife.

10:32.004 --> 10:33.003
You couldn't do it.

10:33.005 --> 10:35.505
You couldn't even get it up!

10:35.507 --> 10:37.973
Jesus.

10:37.975 --> 10:40.042
I'm relieved, but ashamed.

10:40.044 --> 10:41.310
The drinking does that to a man.

10:41.312 --> 10:43.645
Well, it happens to the best of us.

10:43.647 --> 10:45.515
- Jesus.
- Not really.

10:45.517 --> 10:47.217
I'm so relieved.

10:47.219 --> 10:51.554
Thank you.

10:51.556 --> 10:54.256
- Why? Why?
- Ex-exactly!

10:54.258 --> 10:56.225
- Yeah, why?
- Why? You tell me why.

10:56.227 --> 10:59.594
Why must two men be confined
to handshakes and hugs?

10:59.596 --> 11:01.429
What happens when that's not enough?

11:01.431 --> 11:02.863
You come out of the closet!

11:02.865 --> 11:04.832
What?

11:04.834 --> 11:07.100
For such a fine man,
you're so damn limited.

11:07.102 --> 11:09.235
It's a burden, but I cope.

11:09.237 --> 11:11.204
How 'bout a breath mint, dude?

11:11.206 --> 11:12.205
You know, you been throwing up
all morning.

11:12.207 --> 11:15.208
Yeah, what's your excuse?

11:15.210 --> 11:17.511
So you just fire her just like that?

11:17.513 --> 11:19.780
No second chance, no--

11:19.782 --> 11:21.782
Yeah, well, she's a dirty little slut!

11:21.784 --> 11:23.750
Hey!
Lizzie is many things.

11:23.752 --> 11:26.086
"Dirty little slut"
certainly isn't one of them.

11:26.088 --> 11:29.123
Who swims naked in a pool when
the man of the house is home?

11:29.125 --> 11:30.925
She was hot!

11:30.927 --> 11:32.693
She thought she was alone!

11:32.695 --> 11:34.461
Why are you defending her so much?

11:34.463 --> 11:36.496
Because she's great with our son!

11:36.498 --> 11:38.832
Yo! I'm done.

11:38.834 --> 11:41.868
Did my best.
You're up, Marcy.

11:41.870 --> 11:44.803
I fucking hate not having a nanny!

11:48.341 --> 11:50.842
What about you,
big-time movie producer?

11:50.844 --> 11:52.811
You have no say in this?

11:52.813 --> 11:57.784
Charlie, I've produced movies.
Big, small.

11:57.786 --> 12:00.654
I've run two studios.
I have managed the egos

12:00.656 --> 12:03.424
of some of the greatest movie
stars in the world,

12:03.426 --> 12:06.060
but I cannot boss this woman around.

12:06.062 --> 12:07.295
She rules the roost.

12:07.297 --> 12:09.196
Which is just a fancy way of saying

12:09.198 --> 12:11.099
you're fucking
pussy-whipped.

12:11.101 --> 12:13.935
Precisely.

12:13.937 --> 12:16.704
Besides, there was
something weird about it.

12:16.706 --> 12:17.838
What?

12:17.840 --> 12:20.074
The thing with Lizzie.

12:20.076 --> 12:21.141
What do you mean?

12:21.143 --> 12:25.111
I mean, there was a strange vibe.

12:46.367 --> 12:48.435
I'm so sorry,
Mr. Beggs.

12:48.437 --> 12:50.471
Stuart's asleep.
I thought that no one was home.

12:50.473 --> 12:53.942
No need to apologize, and call me Stu!

12:56.446 --> 12:57.978
You have a magnificent body!

12:57.980 --> 12:59.213
Thank you!

12:59.215 --> 13:01.615
Do you think I have what
it takes to be an actress?

13:01.617 --> 13:04.385
Yes.

13:04.387 --> 13:07.955
I don't see Lizzie as
the kind of girl to just...

13:07.957 --> 13:10.992
throw herself at some
creepy old married guy.

13:10.994 --> 13:14.997
Runkle...

13:14.999 --> 13:17.567
I know I am not a handsome man,

13:17.569 --> 13:19.736
but I am a very successful man.

13:19.738 --> 13:22.439
I know what it's like to be
hit on by pretty young things

13:22.441 --> 13:24.375
who want something from me.

13:24.377 --> 13:28.947
Must be nice.
Wish I did.

13:33.185 --> 13:38.222
Whew! Do not go in there
for at least 24 hours.

13:38.224 --> 13:39.490
Okay.

13:39.492 --> 13:40.858
Hey, look at that.
That's neat.

13:40.860 --> 13:41.859
- Thank you.
- Can I play with it?

13:41.861 --> 13:42.893
No! Please don't touch--

13:42.895 --> 13:43.994
- Do you have matchbox cars?
- No!

13:43.996 --> 13:46.196
I have a pitch to a client tomorrow.

13:46.198 --> 13:48.064
How's Batesy?

13:48.066 --> 13:51.233
He's asleep, you know,
sleeping it off upstairs.

13:51.235 --> 13:52.769
How are you?

13:52.771 --> 13:54.103
Well, what can I do?

13:54.105 --> 13:56.039
I mean, he's going through
a crisis, you know?

13:56.041 --> 13:58.943
If I--if I throw him out,
if I leave,

13:58.945 --> 14:00.678
then it's just gonna get worse, right?

14:00.680 --> 14:03.414
So that's it? You're just
gonna stand by your man?

14:03.416 --> 14:07.185
That's what I do.

14:07.187 --> 14:09.454
Thanks for bringing him home,
by the way.

14:09.456 --> 14:10.856
It's my pleasure,

14:10.858 --> 14:13.793
and I--and I wanna apologize for
that weirdness this morning.

14:13.795 --> 14:17.330
You know I love spending any
amount of time with you,

14:17.332 --> 14:20.200
however chaste.

14:20.202 --> 14:22.136
Could you get it?
It's probably just Tyler.

14:22.138 --> 14:24.072
Oh, fabulous.

14:24.074 --> 14:26.875
Stop it.
C-could you say sorry?

14:26.877 --> 14:29.645
- I did!
- No, again, like you mean it.

14:33.216 --> 14:35.951
- Oh!
- What the fuck, stripper?

14:35.953 --> 14:37.519
I found this on the bedroom floor,

14:37.521 --> 14:39.088
and I thought that maybe
he'd want it back!

14:39.090 --> 14:40.890
Have you no shame?
He's a married man!

14:40.892 --> 14:42.892
Oh, so what? I didn't come
here to tell his wife

14:42.894 --> 14:44.093
that he bangs strippers on the side.

14:44.095 --> 14:45.494
He doesn't bang strippers on the side.

14:45.496 --> 14:47.196
He's got a drinking problem
is all--a little one.

14:47.198 --> 14:49.665
Oh, I'll say.
Guy's a fuckin' lunatic.

14:49.667 --> 14:50.766
He wanted me to shove
a dildo up his ass

14:50.768 --> 14:51.801
and jerk him off at the same time.

14:51.803 --> 14:52.902
Oh!
Come on!

14:52.904 --> 14:54.504
- What is that called again?
- Painful?

14:54.506 --> 14:56.273
- No, the digging to China?
- Against God?

14:56.275 --> 14:57.340
The fi--th-th-the fire hose.

14:57.342 --> 14:59.810
- N-n-n-no. The bazooka.
- Wow.

14:59.812 --> 15:01.278
No, no, no, the shotgun.
That's what--

15:01.280 --> 15:02.846
Okay. Yeah, okay, okay.

15:02.848 --> 15:04.014
Oh, God.
I'm sorry.

15:04.016 --> 15:05.849
I got so much crazy shit
goin' on up here.

15:05.851 --> 15:07.784
I'll say.

15:07.786 --> 15:10.020
Well, so, I'm here with his wallet.

15:10.022 --> 15:11.120
- Cool.
- Yeah.

15:11.122 --> 15:12.588
Hand it over, stripper.
Be on your way.

15:12.590 --> 15:15.358
No finder's fee?

15:15.360 --> 15:20.729
What, is everything tip-based
with you people?

15:20.731 --> 15:25.066
There you go.

15:25.068 --> 15:26.635
Not much room there.

15:26.637 --> 15:29.003
Mm-hmm. It's been a pleasure
doing business with you, Hank.

15:29.005 --> 15:31.172
How do I know you didn't take
anything out of his wallet?

15:31.174 --> 15:34.342
Well, I'm not a fuckin' thief,
you asshole. Jesus.

15:34.344 --> 15:36.612
You know, no good deed
goes unpunished in this town.

15:36.614 --> 15:37.913
Yes, that's right.

15:37.915 --> 15:40.148
You're a regular girl scout,
aren't ya?

15:40.150 --> 15:41.416
- What's your part in all this?
- What do you mean?

15:41.418 --> 15:42.818
Well, he's married.

15:42.820 --> 15:44.853
He lives in the big house
behind the white picket fence,

15:44.855 --> 15:47.322
so who the fuck are you?
His gay lover?

15:49.226 --> 15:54.462
If you must know,
his wife is my baby mama.

15:54.464 --> 15:56.665
Come here.

15:56.667 --> 15:57.666
Who's that?

15:57.668 --> 15:59.201
My girlfriend.

15:59.203 --> 16:00.302
- Holly.
- Holly.

16:00.304 --> 16:01.303
- Holly!
- Yeah.

16:01.305 --> 16:02.404
- Karen.
- Karen.

16:02.406 --> 16:04.706
It's so nice to meet you, Holly.

16:04.708 --> 16:07.743
Um, well, you guys
wanna come in, or--

16:07.745 --> 16:09.011
No, no, she's just meeting me here.

16:09.013 --> 16:11.146
We're going hiking.

16:11.148 --> 16:12.315
You hike?

16:12.317 --> 16:13.383
Oh, yeah!
Of course I do.

16:13.385 --> 16:15.518
I love it.
Love it.

16:15.520 --> 16:17.320
Where?

16:17.322 --> 16:19.423
Um, gonna go up,

16:19.425 --> 16:23.527
uh, Mander...Hoff Canyon.

16:23.529 --> 16:25.396
- I haven't heard of that.
- Me neither!

16:25.398 --> 16:27.332
Well, th-that's why I like it!
It's less crowded.

16:27.334 --> 16:29.000
Road less traveled and whatnot.

16:29.002 --> 16:32.003
You gotta watch out
for the snakes, though.

16:32.005 --> 16:34.372
You know what, Karen?
I would love to come inside.

16:34.374 --> 16:36.708
- No, no.
- You have a beautiful home.

16:36.710 --> 16:39.378
Thank you, Holly.
Please come in.

16:39.380 --> 16:43.983
Welcome.

16:43.985 --> 16:45.251
Is she a stripper?

16:45.253 --> 16:47.254
No, she's just workin'
her way through school.

16:47.256 --> 16:49.622
Don't be so fuckin' judgmental,
Karen. God.

16:59.899 --> 17:01.900
- Jesus!
- Charlie!

17:01.902 --> 17:04.202
That was a long fucking shower!

17:04.204 --> 17:05.703
I'm so sorry.
I dozed off.

17:05.704 --> 17:07.271
I was upset, and I sat
on the couch for a second,

17:07.272 --> 17:09.272
and before I knew it,
two hours had gone by.

17:09.275 --> 17:12.642
It's okay. I just--
I-I got scared.

17:12.644 --> 17:14.877
Now, I'm delighted.

17:14.880 --> 17:16.981
I'm just really out of sorts.

17:16.983 --> 17:18.281
I've just lost another job,

17:18.284 --> 17:20.851
and I spent all this money
on acting classes.

17:20.853 --> 17:22.519
Acting classes?

17:22.521 --> 17:24.054
What happened to writing
children's books?

17:24.056 --> 17:26.489
Wh-wh-what happened to going
to cooking school?

17:26.491 --> 17:29.158
I told you.
I change my mind all the time.

17:29.160 --> 17:31.561
I haven't found myself yet.

17:31.563 --> 17:34.631
Besides, Stu said he thinks
I might have what it takes

17:34.633 --> 17:35.999
to be an actress.

17:36.001 --> 17:39.669
Well, you certainly got
the beauty part down pat.

17:39.671 --> 17:43.974
You're so sweet to me, Charlie.

17:43.976 --> 17:47.879
What can I say, you, uh,
summon the sweetness in me.

17:50.282 --> 17:54.986
As well as some other stuff.

17:54.988 --> 17:56.420
Yes, I can tell.

17:56.422 --> 17:59.322
Well, guess what.

17:59.324 --> 18:02.091
What?

18:02.093 --> 18:04.260
I don't work
for Stu and Marcy anymore.

18:04.262 --> 18:06.528
I know.
You told me.

18:06.530 --> 18:10.365
So, this whole thing isn't
quite as inappropriate

18:10.367 --> 18:12.067
as it once was.

18:12.069 --> 18:16.103
I guess it's not.

18:16.105 --> 18:17.304
So...

18:17.306 --> 18:21.575
I guess it wouldn't be
inappropriate...

18:21.577 --> 18:24.178
to do this.

18:30.384 --> 18:31.984
Not at all.

18:31.986 --> 18:36.555
Just like it's not
inappropriate to do this.

18:43.797 --> 18:46.398
- So, Holly, y-you're a dancer.
- Yeah.

18:46.400 --> 18:49.567
Oh, actually, Karen, no.
I am a stripper.

18:49.569 --> 18:51.870
And I'm a realist.

18:51.872 --> 18:55.674
It's like, do you go to the cinema,

18:55.676 --> 18:57.109
or do you go to the movies?

18:57.111 --> 18:59.378
I don't know about you,
but I go to the fuckin' movies.

18:59.380 --> 19:02.014
- Right.
- How 'bout you, handsome?

19:02.016 --> 19:03.082
Huh?

19:03.084 --> 19:05.051
You like strippers?
Or dancers?

19:05.053 --> 19:08.588
Oh, strip--
dancers.

19:08.590 --> 19:09.923
You're fuckin' hot, dude.

19:09.925 --> 19:12.492
You in a band?

19:12.494 --> 19:14.394
Kind of a boyfriend-girlfriend
thing goin' on--

19:14.396 --> 19:17.364
No, I'm not in a band,
but I do play some guitar.

19:17.366 --> 19:20.000
Ooh, guitarists are the best!

19:20.002 --> 19:22.570
So good with their
fuckin' hands! Right?

19:22.572 --> 19:24.672
They know how to find the spot.
Right, baby?

19:24.674 --> 19:26.508
And then that guitar,

19:26.510 --> 19:28.877
up on stage,
it's like this pulsing member,

19:28.879 --> 19:30.913
and they're just workin' it,
and workin' it, and workin' it.

19:30.915 --> 19:34.049
I mean, you know what I'm
talking about. Right, honey?

19:34.051 --> 19:37.086
I don't wanna know if she
knows what you're talking about.

19:37.088 --> 19:40.557
Am I gonna have to get
used to this one, dad?

19:40.559 --> 19:44.494
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm not very domesticated.

19:44.496 --> 19:45.829
Yeah, just don't pee on the rug.

19:45.831 --> 19:49.066
Oh, I did that once!
At Vince Neil's house,

19:49.068 --> 19:51.502
I was so drunk,
I just squatted on the floor,

19:51.504 --> 19:53.837
and I peed everywhere.

19:53.839 --> 19:55.806
He thought it was hot.

19:55.808 --> 19:59.942
That's nice.
So, where'd you guys meet?

19:59.944 --> 20:01.844
Oh, backstage at a Motley show.

20:01.846 --> 20:04.814
I had to wrap my lips
around the tour manager.

20:04.816 --> 20:07.216
- It was totally worth it.
- I think she means us.

20:07.218 --> 20:10.619
Oh, right.
Right. Um--

20:10.621 --> 20:13.488
- Trader Joe's.
- Yeah.

20:13.490 --> 20:17.325
He was handling the melons!

20:17.327 --> 20:18.927
No.

20:22.332 --> 20:24.899
So, you two used to
be a couple, right?

20:24.901 --> 20:26.768
And this is your little girl.

20:26.770 --> 20:29.271
So now, when does Bates
enter the picture?

20:29.273 --> 20:30.505
How do you know Richard?

20:30.507 --> 20:33.575
She doesn't.
I just told her about him.

20:33.577 --> 20:35.310
Why?

20:35.312 --> 20:37.912
'Cause he's such a fuckin'
character, Karen. That's why.

20:37.914 --> 20:41.749
Totally.

20:41.751 --> 20:43.718
- I mean, from what I've heard.
- Yeah.

20:49.323 --> 20:53.493
So, um, anyone want another drink?

20:53.495 --> 20:54.828
I do!

20:54.830 --> 20:56.430
- I'll give you a hand, mom.
- Thanks, sweetie.

20:56.432 --> 20:58.199
I'm gonna come with you guys.

20:58.201 --> 21:00.168
I need to use the ladies' room.

21:00.170 --> 21:04.039
I gotta pee like a fuckin' racehorse.

21:05.309 --> 21:10.480
Way to go, Hank.

21:10.482 --> 21:12.049
Really nice girl you got
yourself there.

21:12.051 --> 21:13.817
Class up the wazoo.

21:13.819 --> 21:14.951
Shut up.

21:14.953 --> 21:16.352
Yeah, whatever, look.
What I wanna know is...

21:16.354 --> 21:19.957
Did Bates fuck
that chick or something?

21:19.959 --> 21:22.626
What? You're talking
about my girlfriend.

21:22.628 --> 21:24.895
Oh, bullshit.
That chick is not your type.

21:24.897 --> 21:26.864
What the fuck do you know
about my type?

21:26.866 --> 21:28.432
I know your type, and she's inside.

21:28.434 --> 21:31.035
And she's not the one pissing
"like a fuckin' racehorse."

21:31.037 --> 21:34.739
My question is, why are you
working so very hard

21:34.741 --> 21:38.843
to protect her from the truth?

21:38.845 --> 21:41.580
Well, maybe she's been
through enough, all right?

21:41.582 --> 21:44.349
Okay, yeah, but maybe
she and Bates don't make it,

21:44.351 --> 21:47.118
and then you've got yourself
another shot at the good life.

21:47.120 --> 21:48.686
Mind your business, son.

21:48.688 --> 21:50.989
And don't think I haven't
entertained that very notion.

21:50.991 --> 21:53.759
But my strict moral code
prohibits me...

21:53.761 --> 21:54.993
- Fair enough.
- Acting on it.

21:54.995 --> 21:57.997
Mm-hmm.

21:57.999 --> 22:01.066
I've been meaning to ask you...

22:01.068 --> 22:02.067
Would you do a favor for me?

22:02.069 --> 22:03.469
No.

22:03.471 --> 22:07.473
No? That quick?
Really?

22:07.475 --> 22:10.376
What?

22:10.378 --> 22:11.510
Will you read my screenplay?

22:11.512 --> 22:12.779
Fuck you.

22:12.781 --> 22:14.915
Okay.

22:14.917 --> 22:17.651
Well, just so you know...

22:17.653 --> 22:21.555
I don't have the same strict
moral code that you do, Hank.

22:23.925 --> 22:26.927
- I give it ten pages.
- Thank you.

22:47.318 --> 22:51.521
That...was exquisite!

22:51.523 --> 22:53.890
Best sex of my life!
Did you see how long I lasted?

22:55.026 --> 23:00.163
Huh? Oh, no. No, n...
You're crying.

23:00.165 --> 23:02.499
Of course you're crying.

23:02.501 --> 23:04.735
I dirtied you.
I'm so sorry.

23:04.737 --> 23:08.839
I just don't know
what I'm going to do now.

23:14.347 --> 23:16.346
F--
Hello?

23:16.348 --> 23:18.048
Have you talked to Lizzie?

23:18.050 --> 23:19.149
No.

23:19.151 --> 23:21.384
Well, I left her a bunch of messages,

23:21.386 --> 23:22.952
and she's not calling me back.

23:22.954 --> 23:25.654
Why should she? You fired her
for no fucking reason.

23:25.656 --> 23:28.190
Okay, so I'm hiring her back,

23:28.192 --> 23:29.824
because Stuart's
a little fuckin' nightmare,

23:29.826 --> 23:31.426
and she's got the magic touch.

23:31.428 --> 23:35.063
She certainly does.

23:35.065 --> 23:38.667
Well, if I see her,
I will let her know.

23:38.669 --> 23:40.502
Thanks.

23:40.504 --> 23:41.836
Hey, you wouldn't wanna come over here

23:41.838 --> 23:43.538
and see if you could put
Stuart down, would you--

23:43.540 --> 23:45.140
Hello?

23:49.213 --> 23:51.981
- Guess what.
- What?

23:51.983 --> 23:54.984
Looks like someone got you
your job back.

23:54.986 --> 23:58.154
Thank you, Charlie.

23:58.156 --> 24:01.258
I guess...

24:01.260 --> 24:02.626
this isn't quite so...

24:02.628 --> 24:04.861
appropriate anymore?

24:04.863 --> 24:09.566
Well, I haven't officially
accepted the position yet.

24:09.568 --> 24:12.402
- Ah.
- Uh-huh.

24:21.981 --> 24:25.049
♪ Well, she loves my cock ♪

24:25.051 --> 24:27.050
♪ loves my cock ♪

24:27.052 --> 24:29.553
Come on, girls,
unleash your inner whores.

24:29.555 --> 24:32.489
I know they're in there.
Come on. Like this.

24:32.491 --> 24:34.825
Come on, roll your hips.
You know--

24:34.827 --> 24:36.092
Did you put something in my drink?

24:36.094 --> 24:37.294
Well, if I did,
I got some in mine, too.

24:37.296 --> 24:38.428
That's for sure.

24:38.430 --> 24:41.031
The pole, right.
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.

24:41.033 --> 24:42.499
Come on, tall boy.

24:42.501 --> 24:45.436
Uh...Oh!

24:46.439 --> 24:48.739
Yes.

Hey.
Hey! What are you doing?

24:55.181 --> 24:57.281
What the fuck?

24:57.283 --> 25:00.384
Hey! Hey, hey! Ow!

25:00.386 --> 25:03.620
- Get out! Get out!
- Hey!

25:06.057 --> 25:07.723
You come to my home?

25:07.725 --> 25:11.694
You lay hands on my woman?
How fucking dare you?

25:11.696 --> 25:13.996
You psycho slut from hell!

25:13.998 --> 25:15.631
Batesy, Batesy!
She's with me!

25:15.633 --> 25:18.767
This is my girlfriend.

25:18.769 --> 25:20.202
Holly.

25:37.453 --> 25:40.454
It's nice to meet you, Holly.

25:40.456 --> 25:44.358
I'll be upstairs.

25:47.128 --> 25:48.128
How can I help?

25:48.130 --> 25:49.195
You can take your tramp,

25:49.197 --> 25:51.765
and you can get the fuck
out of my house!

25:51.767 --> 25:52.932
Oh! Who's she calling
a tramp, huh?

25:52.934 --> 25:54.367
Pretty sure she means you.

25:54.369 --> 25:56.069
This is all your fault.

25:56.071 --> 25:58.905
Everything you fucking touch
turns to shit!

25:58.907 --> 26:00.441
I know this is probably
none of my business,

26:00.443 --> 26:02.076
but I don't think
this is Hank's fault.

26:02.078 --> 26:03.077
- Shut up!
- Shut up!

26:03.079 --> 26:04.412
Shutting up.

26:04.414 --> 26:05.880
Oh, no, no.
It is my fault.

26:05.882 --> 26:08.116
It's always my fault.

26:08.118 --> 26:11.520
How can I be of service?

26:11.522 --> 26:13.588
All right.
Let's go, tramp.

26:13.590 --> 26:15.022
I'll get you that screenplay, Hank.

26:15.024 --> 26:16.323
Yeah, can't wait.

26:16.325 --> 26:18.158
Becca, let this be a lesson to you.

26:18.160 --> 26:19.526
Stay off the pole.

26:19.528 --> 26:22.963
You think this is funny?
Do you see anyone laughing?

26:22.965 --> 26:24.464
I'm so sick and tired of you
showing up out of nowhere

26:24.466 --> 26:27.367
and fucking with our lives.

26:27.369 --> 26:29.035
Like somehow you know better.

26:29.037 --> 26:32.105
You make a mess,
and then you waltz off,

26:32.107 --> 26:33.873
like you've done something noble.

26:33.875 --> 26:37.744
But we have to clean up after you!

26:37.746 --> 26:40.213
Let this be a lesson to you, dad.

26:40.215 --> 26:44.117
Stay the fuck away.

26:44.119 --> 26:47.954
I like you much better
when you're in New York.

26:47.956 --> 26:51.124
Whoo! Chick's got
fuckin' balls, huh?

26:51.126 --> 26:53.193
Thanks for the hospitality, bitches!

26:53.195 --> 26:57.497
Mm-hmm.

26:57.499 --> 27:00.333
You all right?

27:00.335 --> 27:03.470
Wanna get a drink?

27:03.472 --> 27:04.937
Sure, why not?

27:04.939 --> 27:06.372
Cool, let's hit the 'bow.

27:06.374 --> 27:08.274
- The rainbow?
- Mm-hmm.

27:08.276 --> 27:10.709
I went there once with a guy
named Lew Ashby.

27:10.711 --> 27:11.710
You ever heard of him?

27:11.712 --> 27:13.212
Hear of him?

27:13.214 --> 27:17.150
Sucked his dick more times
than I can count.

27:17.152 --> 27:19.720
Ooh!

27:19.722 --> 27:23.358
You have a Porsche, huh?

27:23.360 --> 27:26.261
Very, very hot.
That makes mama wet.

27:26.263 --> 27:29.332
Holy shit, this is my favorite song!

27:29.334 --> 27:30.966
Check it out.
Watch this.

27:33.972 --> 27:36.940
