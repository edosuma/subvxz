SUMMERTIME

02:02.900 --> 02:05.201
- You didn't take any corn at all?
- No.

02:06.980 --> 02:09.079
Antoine's parents are
starting to plant it.

02:09.366 --> 02:12.890
Sweetie, the day you have a husband,
you can ask him to plant corn.

02:16.406 --> 02:19.940
But if you keep letting
them go one after another...

02:22.073 --> 02:24.417
Your friends are faster.

02:25.665 --> 02:27.480
I don't want to get married.

02:31.998 --> 02:33.903
I don't want to get married.

02:38.137 --> 02:40.000
What are you doing every night?

02:41.011 --> 02:43.044
Getting home in the middle of the night.

02:43.820 --> 02:45.780
I walk around.

02:47.588 --> 02:49.191
Are you seeing anyone?

02:49.739 --> 02:50.971
No.

02:52.235 --> 02:54.242
- Is it Antoine?
- No.

02:58.636 --> 03:00.491
You can't stay alone all your life.

03:02.384 --> 03:04.290
Solitude is awful.

03:46.698 --> 03:48.649
I'm getting married in September.

03:54.374 --> 03:55.777
Who to?

03:56.088 --> 03:57.612
Pierre Coubin.

03:58.429 --> 03:59.903
You love him?

04:00.287 --> 04:01.704
I don't know.

04:02.704 --> 04:05.622
I don't really know him. I mean,

04:06.044 --> 04:09.338
I've known him all my life, but I
don't know if he'll make a good husband.

04:10.664 --> 04:12.136
He seems nice.

04:12.256 --> 04:14.622
He's ambitious, he wants
to go live in Limoges.

04:15.693 --> 04:17.303
Oh, yeah, very ambitious.

04:17.612 --> 04:20.092
Do you want to stay here all your life?

04:20.869 --> 04:22.157
Yeah.

04:25.063 --> 04:26.832
I like everything here.

04:32.692 --> 04:34.704
We need to move on, Delphine.

04:35.799 --> 04:37.391
We're not kids anymore.

04:37.419 --> 04:39.699
What happened between
us doesn't matter to you?

04:40.442 --> 04:41.912
It does.

04:43.082 --> 04:45.160
Of course it does, but,

04:45.280 --> 04:46.993
it wasn't serious.

04:59.911 --> 05:01.466
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:02.524 --> 05:05.304
- What are you doing here?
- Nothing, just walking.

05:05.763 --> 05:07.017
You?

05:08.655 --> 05:10.996
- You want it?
- No, thanks.

05:11.510 --> 05:13.579
You'll get caught someday.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.772
Will you go to the dance in Aubusson?

05:20.047 --> 05:21.526
Dunno.

05:22.097 --> 05:24.362
We could go together.

05:26.431 --> 05:28.331
I don't know, Antoine.

05:28.716 --> 05:30.004
We'll see.

06:06.681 --> 06:08.356
Where's Delphine?

06:08.580 --> 06:09.876
I don't know.

06:18.540 --> 06:20.066
Delphine.

06:24.905 --> 06:26.412
Delphine?

06:31.850 --> 06:33.572
Delphine?!

07:36.020 --> 07:38.469
PARIS SPRING 1971

07:38.589 --> 07:42.241
The President welcomed, this
morning at the Élysée Palace,

07:42.279 --> 07:45.527
11 mothers, with at
least 10 children each.

07:45.556 --> 07:49.815
Mr. Pompidou awarded them the
Medal of the French Family.

07:49.847 --> 07:53.592
And during an improvised speech, the
president spoke about the role of family.

07:53.611 --> 07:57.252
"Raising kids is a lot of
work but it's rewarding."

07:57.276 --> 08:01.916
"The notion of family is
threatened by the current climate."

08:02.036 --> 08:05.527
"A climate emphasized by the
violence spreading everywhere."

08:05.545 --> 08:08.747
"France can't become a dictatorship,

08:08.867 --> 08:12.491
but the government must
act to stop this violence."

08:41.088 --> 08:42.297
Hey!

08:43.044 --> 08:46.919
- Hey, you're having fun?
- Yeah, it's your time for once!

08:48.359 --> 08:50.625
- You're laughing now?
- Leave her alone!

08:52.581 --> 08:54.266
Tarts!

08:57.148 --> 08:58.955
Close the door!

09:01.700 --> 09:03.296
Sluts!

09:04.309 --> 09:05.929
Go fuck yourself!

09:08.501 --> 09:10.461
You see how he acted?

09:10.462 --> 09:12.930
If we had stolen his
wallet, he'd run the same.

09:12.931 --> 09:16.412
We did worse than steal his
wallet. We stole his virility.

09:18.639 --> 09:20.432
Thank god you were here.

09:20.433 --> 09:23.488
- You don't scare easily!
- He was threatening.

09:23.489 --> 09:26.532
- He wasn't that dangerous.
- Really?

09:26.533 --> 09:28.723
He was crazy.

09:29.318 --> 09:30.234
Was it a dare?

09:30.256 --> 09:32.167
No, it was to show them how it feels.

09:32.172 --> 09:35.077
When it's our arse it's normal, when
it's theirs, they don't like it so much.

09:35.121 --> 09:37.962
- Next time we do it to cops!
- Yeah!

09:38.802 --> 09:40.610
What do you demonstrate for?

09:40.628 --> 09:41.934
Women's rights.

09:43.174 --> 09:46.030
The right to not be bothered
in the street for starters.

09:46.150 --> 09:48.807
The right to do what we want, when we
want it, and with whoever we want to.

09:48.824 --> 09:49.946
Don't you agree?

09:51.442 --> 09:52.481
I don't know.

09:52.601 --> 09:54.944
You don't feel like there
are things you can't do

09:54.950 --> 09:56.321
because you're a woman?

10:45.308 --> 10:47.515
I'm looking for a meeting, but
I don't really know about what.

10:47.524 --> 10:49.361
All I know is that there's
women, and it's on Thursdays.

10:49.381 --> 10:51.891
Oh, the hotheads? It's in the
lecture theater on the right.

11:09.933 --> 11:13.372
You're being sectarian!
Our strength is to blend.

11:19.272 --> 11:21.201
What men need to understand

11:21.219 --> 11:24.083
is that for now, they don't belong here!

11:26.862 --> 11:28.731
And I know what people'll say.

11:28.755 --> 11:31.056
They'll say we're against men.

11:31.284 --> 11:33.435
But we're not. We're not!

11:33.555 --> 11:36.712
Besides, half the women
here are involved with a guy.

11:40.642 --> 11:42.452
We're not against men,

11:42.476 --> 11:44.908
we're for the women! For us!

11:47.275 --> 11:48.372
I'm sorry,

11:48.569 --> 11:51.564
I'm sorry but when there's a guy
around, a woman's attitude changes.

11:51.613 --> 11:53.967
Her speech is different.
And even an educated woman,

11:54.015 --> 11:56.717
when she's around a man,
whether she knows him or not,

11:56.735 --> 11:59.934
she censors her speech and her thoughts.

12:00.905 --> 12:04.518
What we want right now, is
to get back our free speech

12:04.536 --> 12:07.519
without caring what the boyfriend,
boss or dad will think of it,

12:07.525 --> 12:09.233
and talk between women.

12:11.743 --> 12:14.169
OK, I agree with the separatism,

12:14.175 --> 12:17.422
but in this case, there's a journalist
who wants to attend our meeting...

12:22.778 --> 12:25.156
Down with the straight journalism!

12:26.462 --> 12:28.406
Let everyone talk!

12:28.686 --> 12:31.846
If even within Women's Lib
we can't agree, we're doomed!

12:31.966 --> 12:34.777
Men in the kitchen, women at the bar!

I really didn't envision you
sitting at a desk all day long.

13:51.253 --> 13:52.863
I envisionned you...

13:52.891 --> 13:55.353
doing something more physical.

13:55.473 --> 13:57.057
Oh yeah? Like what?

13:57.366 --> 13:59.032
Swimming teacher.

13:59.266 --> 14:00.941
Yeah, you'd be good at that.

14:00.941 --> 14:03.394
You need to be serious,
focused, and it's physical.

14:04.133 --> 14:06.718
- And what do you do?
- Guess.

14:07.224 --> 14:09.174
It's too difficult, I barely know you.

14:09.196 --> 14:11.178
You have two attempts,
then you'll have a forfeit.

14:13.151 --> 14:14.948
Saleswoman?

14:15.173 --> 14:16.985
No, I'm not a saleswoman.

14:17.427 --> 14:18.902
Last attempt.

14:19.192 --> 14:21.564
Um... doctor?

14:21.948 --> 14:23.466
Why do you think that?

14:24.446 --> 14:26.415
Well, you speak well, so

14:26.460 --> 14:28.886
it means you studied,

14:28.893 --> 14:30.828
and you seem to care about others.

14:31.133 --> 14:33.754
- Forget it, it's stupid.
- No, not at all.

14:34.222 --> 14:35.645
I'm a teacher.

14:35.968 --> 14:37.518
Spanish teacher.

14:39.408 --> 14:40.850
So, what's the forfeit?

14:40.878 --> 14:43.920
You must come to the
next meeting Thursday.

14:45.792 --> 14:47.050
Ah.

14:50.978 --> 14:53.646
It's a strong sentence,
but we have to compromise.

14:55.077 --> 14:57.464
We're talking about people who
never speak about themselves.

14:57.584 --> 15:00.076
There's no union for prisoners,

15:00.085 --> 15:02.481
so if we don't represent them

15:02.601 --> 15:04.300
there's no point.

15:04.420 --> 15:06.507
You know how feeble
bourgeois journalists are.

15:06.544 --> 15:08.603
Le Monde won't accept it.

15:08.641 --> 15:12.169
If we don't stir up a hornets' nest...

15:13.199 --> 15:15.492
How many articles about
French prisons are there?

15:15.529 --> 15:17.085
- Zero.
- We'll be the first ones,

15:17.086 --> 15:20.274
and it'll be shot down. It's stupid.

15:20.275 --> 15:23.731
We're not gonna censure
ourselves until Fauvert does it.

15:23.748 --> 15:26.697
What's our goal here? To publish a good
article, or to be published in Le Monde?

15:26.725 --> 15:28.997
Being published in Le Monde
would gives it importance.

15:29.046 --> 15:32.425
We have something to say, we worked for
a year, and in order to be published,

15:32.444 --> 15:34.408
we're gonna write what they want to read?

15:34.575 --> 15:38.398
If it's just a reported speech,
it's pointless. It's demagogic!

15:38.735 --> 15:40.794
Demagogic? Really?

15:40.813 --> 15:43.237
Of course it is.

15:43.237 --> 15:47.739
Prison creates new criminals.
That's what we think.

15:48.047 --> 15:50.744
Can you take my blue dress too?

15:51.484 --> 15:54.404
Put it aside though, so I don't have
to search for hours in your mess.

15:54.414 --> 15:56.556
I know, I need to clean up.

15:56.722 --> 15:58.958
- I don't have enough time.
- Oh, yeah, it's hard to do everything,

15:58.972 --> 16:02.603
free your sisters from the male
superiority and clean your clothes.

16:03.643 --> 16:04.925
Yeah.

16:05.045 --> 16:07.650
What would I do without you?

16:08.484 --> 16:11.309
Women can't live without men.

16:12.488 --> 16:14.073
Chauvinist.

16:15.166 --> 16:18.077
- Shrew.
- Boor.

16:19.912 --> 16:21.606
- Virago.
- Supporter of slavery.

16:21.634 --> 16:23.263
Suffragette.

16:23.975 --> 16:26.591
- Pompidou's voter.
- Ah, no, no.

16:26.633 --> 16:30.360
- No names!
- You didn't answer so you lost.

16:30.368 --> 16:32.409
No, no, no, you're
cheating. You're cheating!

16:32.428 --> 16:34.890
- A punishment for you!
- Go ahead.

16:39.393 --> 16:41.648
I won, I won.

16:59.451 --> 17:00.681
Hey.

17:01.192 --> 17:03.579
Delphine, you're here.

17:03.579 --> 17:04.800
You missed a lot.

17:04.830 --> 17:07.384
We laughed so much at Ménie Grégoire.

17:07.638 --> 17:10.177
Everyone went on the set.
People were screaming,

17:10.184 --> 17:12.109
- "Liberty! Liberty!"
- Ah, Delphine.

17:12.529 --> 17:13.472
Hey.

17:14.244 --> 17:15.994
- How are you?
- I'm good, you?

17:16.022 --> 17:18.859
I'm telling her about Ménie Grégoire.

17:18.888 --> 17:21.246
Oh la la, it was something!

17:23.267 --> 17:25.558
I thought she'd faint.

17:31.927 --> 17:33.127
Wanna try?

17:33.128 --> 17:35.398
The magazine really
doesn't stick its neck out.

17:35.417 --> 17:38.094
They say: "The 343 sluts:

17:38.131 --> 17:40.340
it's either courage or exhibitionism."

17:40.368 --> 17:43.125
Of course. Like their
article is courageous.

17:45.245 --> 17:47.079
It's OK.

17:47.107 --> 17:48.708
- Sorry.
- It's OK. It's OK.

17:48.828 --> 17:50.805
"We're calling on our sisters:

17:50.842 --> 17:53.547
Let's demand, hand in
hand, appropriate wages,

17:53.566 --> 17:56.092
on par with the work
produced, and equal to men;

17:56.093 --> 17:58.115
that women stop being treated as objects.

17:58.124 --> 18:00.661
Meeting in Amphitheater B, April 23."

18:00.914 --> 18:03.375
How are we doing with the banners?

18:04.358 --> 18:06.221
On the fourth.

18:06.227 --> 18:08.074
We need more, right?

18:08.083 --> 18:11.247
- Maybe one.
- Yeah, it'll be better.

18:43.998 --> 18:45.196
No.

18:45.402 --> 18:46.985
Why? Are you crazy?

18:47.105 --> 18:49.381
You have to. I keep
saying so to my students.

18:49.501 --> 18:51.844
Discreetly though, I
don't want to get fired.

18:51.881 --> 18:54.287
Why don't you take it? You
think it's too expensive?

18:54.680 --> 18:57.181
- No, that's not it.
- My duty as a doctor,

18:57.301 --> 18:59.698
is to do everything possible

regardless of race,

sex, religion... and if we
don't make any distinction

19:07.926 --> 19:09.873
based on race, religion or sex,

19:09.915 --> 19:13.178
why should we make one based on age?

19:13.298 --> 19:16.857
What if one day we say that our seniors

19:16.885 --> 19:21.612
aren't humans, so we can simply kill them.

19:21.846 --> 19:25.946
No, no. Medicine isn't
on the side of death.

19:26.264 --> 19:28.193
It's on the side of life.

19:28.464 --> 19:32.255
So when women have the
chance to be with child,

19:32.751 --> 19:35.635
but still want to abort,

19:36.159 --> 19:38.402
I want to tell them:

19:38.569 --> 19:41.661
"Be responsible. When you drive a car,

19:41.781 --> 19:43.451
you respect the traffic laws.

19:43.451 --> 19:46.240
Well, pregnant women and
their little passenger,

19:46.243 --> 19:48.964
it's life. It's a child to be born."

19:48.973 --> 19:52.287
- My body is not a car!
- Here, a human life!

19:52.407 --> 19:54.767
What's going on?

19:58.337 --> 20:00.326
- Enough!
- Your mother should have done

20:00.354 --> 20:02.666
- everyone a favor and abort!
- Asshole!

20:05.242 --> 20:06.608
Fascist!

20:16.380 --> 20:18.074
Stick it!

20:29.029 --> 20:30.693
What are you doing?

20:30.899 --> 20:32.499
Hurry up!

20:44.454 --> 20:47.421
- For a free abortion law.
- Just don't fuck.

20:47.449 --> 20:50.360
- You didn't fuck?
- Of course, but I was careful.

20:50.391 --> 20:53.143
- How?
- We managed.

20:53.310 --> 20:56.913
"Dear Antoine. Paris really
is an incredible city."

20:56.951 --> 21:00.609
"Even though I hadn't realized it
before. Every day is different."

21:00.620 --> 21:03.231
So much is happening here.

21:03.653 --> 21:06.574
"I met a great girl."

21:07.678 --> 21:09.493
"A great girl."

21:10.309 --> 21:12.162
"An amazing girl."

21:12.649 --> 21:14.456
"A fantastic girl."

21:17.085 --> 21:19.004
"Her name's Carole."

21:21.504 --> 21:23.348
Sorry, I probably got the wrong door.

21:23.468 --> 21:26.053
- You're here for the meeting?
- Yes.

21:26.173 --> 21:28.497
It's the right door. Come in.

21:28.617 --> 21:31.062
- Get out!
- I'm being kicked out of my own place now.

21:31.071 --> 21:32.578
We don't need you anymore.

21:32.597 --> 21:34.638
- See ya.
- See ya.

21:34.984 --> 21:36.707
- You good?
- Yeah.

21:37.396 --> 21:39.608
- Isn't this Carole's?
- It is.

21:39.728 --> 21:42.613
Carole and Manuel's. The boudoir.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.752
He's not crazy at all. He is
a specialist in literature,

21:47.770 --> 21:49.633
he is super smart, very funny.

21:49.642 --> 21:52.167
But he's queer. So his fucking parents

21:52.204 --> 21:54.853
put him in a mental institution
to cure him. Long live family.

21:54.973 --> 21:56.597
Adeline, for us it's a no,

21:56.597 --> 21:58.572
we don't deal with such cases, that's all.

21:58.869 --> 22:01.499
We have to stay on point:
abortion, contraception,

22:01.536 --> 22:03.352
otherwise we're gonna divide ourselves.

22:03.904 --> 22:07.467
So I should leave my best friend there

22:07.468 --> 22:10.429
enduring electroshocks,
and maybe a lobotomy,

22:10.448 --> 22:13.087
just because it's not what we
fight for, and it's too far away?

22:13.115 --> 22:14.912
That's not what we said.

22:15.175 --> 22:17.937
Wait, it's legal to do that to someone?

22:17.946 --> 22:20.061
Yes it's legal, and that's the problem.

22:20.070 --> 22:22.542
Put a queer in a mental
institution is legal.

22:22.570 --> 22:24.059
So, what's your plan?

22:24.077 --> 22:27.793
My plan's easy. We go
there and we grab him.

22:27.821 --> 22:30.976
I'm sorry, Adeline, but it's not our
business to handle men's problems.

22:30.991 --> 22:33.297
We're not gonna start messing
with minority groups' struggles.

22:33.334 --> 22:35.914
Minority? You've got a nerve to say that.

22:35.917 --> 22:40.102
I fight for the pill, but it's not my
girlfriend's who's gonna knock me up.

22:43.603 --> 22:46.720
- I'm really disappointed in you guys.
- Don't take it personally.

22:46.840 --> 22:50.230
We pick the fights, we have to be
coherent. We can't disperse like that.

22:50.249 --> 22:52.810
It doesn't have to be done
under the Women's Lib's flag.

22:52.930 --> 22:55.147
- Obviously.
- Well, that's it then.

22:55.182 --> 22:58.423
I don't get it. Adeline is
always the first to support you,

22:58.461 --> 23:01.327
she always sticks with you no matter what,

23:01.340 --> 23:03.909
she was there for Chambart, and
you can't even be there for her?

23:04.300 --> 23:06.343
Thanks a lot. Thank you.

23:06.463 --> 23:09.154
It's her best friend, seriously.

23:09.274 --> 23:12.531
- Carole, come on, you're coming?
- I don't know.

23:12.560 --> 23:14.890
What? Do you need your
boyfriend's approval?

23:15.892 --> 23:17.997
What's up with you?

23:18.117 --> 23:21.378
- You don't go, but I will.
- It's stupid.

23:24.805 --> 23:26.480
One group goes to Plessis-Robinson,

23:26.490 --> 23:28.257
the other one goes to grab your friend.

23:28.820 --> 23:30.534
Why did you change your mind?

23:30.654 --> 23:33.519
I'm going to be there for my friend.

23:33.884 --> 23:37.132
That's a very good reason.

23:37.348 --> 23:40.185
So, you go this way.

23:40.194 --> 23:43.731
- And the second right...
- On the map, we're there.

23:43.751 --> 23:46.699
But I was thinking about
taking this blue path.

23:46.737 --> 23:48.936
- No, you can't. That's a stream.
- Ah.

23:49.056 --> 23:53.078
Maybe if you row, but
otherwise, I don't think so.

23:53.198 --> 23:55.909
I'm sorry, my husband always
says I can't read a map.

23:55.911 --> 23:58.457
- Yes.
- We're gonna make it.

23:58.476 --> 24:01.519
We're here, and the castle's there.

24:01.856 --> 24:05.375
- No, madam, look.
- Where are we? We're here, right?

24:05.419 --> 24:07.116
Not at all, Mrs.

24:45.905 --> 24:47.920
Give me your hand.

25:19.098 --> 25:20.415
Hey!

25:20.755 --> 25:22.356
- Stop!
- Go, go, go!

25:27.373 --> 25:29.002
Where are you going?

25:54.831 --> 25:57.115
I can't open my eyes anymore.

26:14.451 --> 26:16.675
- Hello, auntie.
- Hello, sweetie.

26:16.716 --> 26:18.354
- Are you OK?
- Yes.

26:18.857 --> 26:21.513
- I'm happy to see you.
- Me too.

26:22.077 --> 26:25.427
- This is my aunt: Hélène.
- Hello, ma'am.

26:25.642 --> 26:28.291
- What's going on?
- Just a little accident.

26:28.329 --> 26:29.742
Nothing serious.

26:29.862 --> 26:33.544
- Are you sure?
- We made a crazy turn.

26:34.789 --> 26:37.626
- You want anything to drink?
- Oh, yes, please, good idea.

26:40.237 --> 26:42.117
You OK, Guitou?

26:44.684 --> 26:46.753
He's coming back.

26:46.873 --> 26:48.475
Here we are.

27:00.840 --> 27:02.137
Here.

27:07.814 --> 27:10.042
I've never been in the south before.

27:17.175 --> 27:19.071
It's weird.

27:19.696 --> 27:21.256
Don't drag too much.

27:23.025 --> 27:25.953
No, not that, the landscape.

27:27.377 --> 27:29.473
It's different back home.

27:29.593 --> 27:32.216
It always feels like the soil is drenched.

27:33.507 --> 27:35.416
Here when you walk,

27:35.632 --> 27:37.504
the soil is hard.

27:37.710 --> 27:40.125
Your foot bounces back,
it gives you momentum.

27:42.250 --> 27:44.309
Back home, even in the summer,

27:45.058 --> 27:47.015
your foot sinks in.

27:47.135 --> 27:49.036
As if the soil was going to swallow it.

27:49.156 --> 27:51.235
As if you have to fight just to walk.

27:53.576 --> 27:55.232
You know what I mean?

27:55.399 --> 27:57.776
Yeah, yeah, I think so.

28:06.702 --> 28:08.852
We're out of sleeping bags.

28:21.750 --> 28:23.659
I never fought with a man,

28:23.687 --> 28:25.756
it's always with women back at the dojo.

28:25.784 --> 28:27.141
Cheers.

28:27.180 --> 28:29.354
In the country, it's
like an unwritten law.

28:29.388 --> 28:31.737
- Here, taste this.
- Thank you.

28:32.290 --> 28:34.892
For example, my mother
doesn't have a salary,

28:35.012 --> 28:37.410
no social security, no checkbook.

28:37.530 --> 28:39.563
But she works all day long.

28:39.797 --> 28:42.483
And when a decision must
be made about the farm,

28:42.689 --> 28:45.919
- she doesn't have a say.
- It's crazy.

28:45.956 --> 28:47.716
Shift your weight back, push him forward,

28:47.744 --> 28:50.149
you pin him and you do an armlock.

28:50.269 --> 28:52.246
- Oh.
- Do that really fast.

28:52.265 --> 28:55.000
If you do that, he can't move.

28:56.759 --> 28:58.698
Why didn't you say something
during the meetings?

28:58.730 --> 29:00.840
I thought no one would be
interested to hear about it.

29:00.858 --> 29:03.289
Are you kidding? Everyone would
have loved to hear about it.

29:03.316 --> 29:05.736
That's exactly against such
things we're fighting for.

29:05.764 --> 29:07.554
- Adeline.
- No, wait, wait.

29:07.589 --> 29:10.144
- I'm embarrassed.
- Why?

29:10.264 --> 29:11.558
Thanks.

29:11.678 --> 29:14.329
I don't want to talk about
it in front of everyone.

29:23.735 --> 29:25.447
Can I sleep in your bed?

29:25.614 --> 29:27.890
Adeline snores like a trooper.

29:28.087 --> 29:29.374
Sure.

29:36.895 --> 29:38.460
Thanks.

29:48.178 --> 29:49.523
What?

29:51.199 --> 29:55.577
The situation at the farm can't
keep going. You need to take it back.

29:56.083 --> 29:58.256
You need to do

29:58.500 --> 30:02.150
a farmers collective or
something. Something unique.

30:03.208 --> 30:06.277
- Did you smoke again?
- Barely.

30:07.456 --> 30:08.865
What?

30:08.985 --> 30:13.587
I never said I wanted to
kick my dad out of the farm.

30:14.626 --> 30:16.227
You're a chicken.

30:16.246 --> 30:18.417
- No.
- Yes, like most women.

30:18.436 --> 30:21.347
Men still have a bright future.

30:39.197 --> 30:41.172
What are you doing?

30:43.923 --> 30:46.376
Go away, Carole. Go sleep elsewhere.

30:47.279 --> 30:49.072
It's OK, it's no big deal.

30:49.099 --> 30:52.117
- We drank too much.
- No, you drank too much.

30:54.893 --> 30:56.955
Go away, Carole!

31:34.619 --> 31:36.042
"I was sixteen and a half.

31:36.286 --> 31:38.580
I was in a coed high school.

31:38.617 --> 31:41.313
I was sick, and I didn't have
my period, so a friend told me:

31:41.313 --> 31:44.359
'You're pregnant.' She gave me
the address of a doctor in Pigalle.

31:44.376 --> 31:47.922
The first time I went to see him,
he was on a first name basis with me.

31:47.978 --> 31:50.175
He told me, 'You're one month pregnant.'

31:50.295 --> 31:52.335
I was panicked and completely disoriented.

31:52.358 --> 31:56.014
He asked me: 'What are you
gonna do?' I had no idea.

31:56.027 --> 31:57.653
I didn't want to get married.

31:57.654 --> 31:59.838
I didn't have a boyfriend.
The father was in La Rochelle,

31:59.839 --> 32:01.996
I had no way to reach him... "

32:17.864 --> 32:19.167
Hello.

32:19.759 --> 32:20.927
Hey.

32:22.230 --> 32:24.288
You weren't at the meeting yesterday.

32:25.876 --> 32:27.860
No, I didn't feel like it.

32:30.946 --> 32:33.402
Look, I wanted to tell
you about last time,

32:34.068 --> 32:36.359
I'm not shocked, not at all.

32:36.696 --> 32:37.764
I...

32:38.007 --> 32:40.006
I was just taken aback.

32:40.560 --> 32:41.768
But...

32:41.991 --> 32:43.270
I mean...

32:43.286 --> 32:45.495
I have lesbian friends,

32:45.540 --> 32:47.839
but I'm not, that's all.

32:49.170 --> 32:50.416
Me neither.

35:17.914 --> 35:19.977
I'm taking the banners.

35:20.009 --> 35:22.393
- Well, you're pretty late.
- Yeah, yeah, don't tell me off.

35:22.415 --> 35:24.396
I don't. Take the banners instead.

35:24.896 --> 35:26.115
You OK?

35:27.231 --> 35:28.440
Yeah, I'm fine.

35:32.520 --> 35:34.706
We can make the first trip.

35:35.254 --> 35:37.228
Put everything in the car.

35:52.326 --> 35:54.306
We need to be first in the rally.

35:54.565 --> 35:56.227
Who's taking that?

36:17.358 --> 36:18.610
Delphine.

36:20.195 --> 36:21.863
Let's go to your place.

36:55.971 --> 36:58.267
What the hell are you talking about?

36:59.526 --> 37:01.602
Is it to prove to yourself
you're a free woman?

37:01.722 --> 37:04.170
I'm not trying to prove anything.

37:05.140 --> 37:06.748
I didn't wake up one morning thinking

37:06.749 --> 37:08.838
"Oh, today I'm sleeping with a girl."

37:08.879 --> 37:10.334
It happened, that's all.

37:13.697 --> 37:16.241
I thought it'd only be a one-time thing.

37:16.945 --> 37:19.750
- But it's lasting, and...
- What? You want to break up?

37:19.870 --> 37:22.220
No, otherwise I wouldn't
tell you about it.

37:25.734 --> 37:27.817
Is it just a sex thing or are you in love?

37:29.294 --> 37:30.777
I don't know, Manuel.

37:31.204 --> 37:32.560
I don't know.

38:06.870 --> 38:08.345
Are you seeing her today?

38:09.621 --> 38:10.705
I don't know.

38:12.708 --> 38:13.808
You're lying.

38:13.975 --> 38:15.367
I know you.

38:15.396 --> 38:18.293
You dislike lying so much, when
you have, you become all yellow.

38:18.974 --> 38:20.335
I swear.

38:22.570 --> 38:25.703
It's not a sure thing, but
we might see each other.

38:26.470 --> 38:27.647
OK.

38:29.042 --> 38:30.944
Find a place to spend the night then.

38:31.917 --> 38:34.687
You're not coming in our
bed after you fucked her.

39:26.923 --> 39:27.745
No!

39:33.683 --> 39:36.279
Calm down, calm down, calm down.

39:37.878 --> 39:39.401
Bad girl.

39:39.898 --> 39:41.020
Shh.

39:51.190 --> 39:52.921
Oh, come on.

39:54.011 --> 39:56.377
Down with the bourgeoise society!

40:13.640 --> 40:14.864
Te quiero.

40:15.241 --> 40:17.265
- Te quiero.
- Te quiero?

40:17.266 --> 40:18.500
Mi amor.

40:19.437 --> 40:20.640
Mi amor.

40:20.641 --> 40:22.699
Me gustan tus pechos.

40:23.034 --> 40:25.249
- What does it mean?
- Repeat it.

40:25.648 --> 40:27.488
- Me gustan...
- Tus pechos.

40:27.525 --> 40:29.318
- Tus pechos.
- Good.

40:29.336 --> 40:31.265
Me gustan... what does it mean.

40:31.311 --> 40:32.870
Nothing.

40:34.926 --> 40:36.810
- That's the "pechos"?
- Yes!

40:36.930 --> 40:39.695
Ah, the pechos. Yeah,
me gustan tus pechos.

40:39.704 --> 40:41.642
You've got it, my love!

41:07.338 --> 41:08.600
Hey.

42:03.508 --> 42:06.541
Hello. Miss Vinatier?

42:06.707 --> 42:09.260
- Yes.
- I have a telegram for you.

42:35.400 --> 42:36.915
I don't get it.

42:36.951 --> 42:38.943
If he was tired, why didn't he stop?

42:39.376 --> 42:41.990
He didn't look tired, he was like usual.

42:43.244 --> 42:44.930
I didn't see it coming.

42:45.050 --> 42:47.986
Just the day before,
he was running around.

42:48.004 --> 42:49.959
You know how he is.

42:52.043 --> 42:55.415
Then, yesterday morning,
he was loading some cans,

42:55.755 --> 42:58.176
and I saw him fall on the ground.

43:00.290 --> 43:02.102
The doctors told me,

43:02.643 --> 43:05.095
there's no warning signs
for that type of thing.

43:08.152 --> 43:10.342
We're lucky he's still here.

43:13.047 --> 43:15.265
Does it look like we're lucky?

43:25.138 --> 43:26.816
It's hard for me too.

43:29.556 --> 43:30.761
I...

43:31.669 --> 43:34.129
I thought about it, and
I don't have a choice.

43:35.529 --> 43:36.982
I don't have a brother,

43:37.102 --> 43:39.850
an uncle or a cousin. If I
don't do it, no one else will.

43:40.669 --> 43:43.383
Are you crazy? You can't cut
yourself off again out there.

43:43.932 --> 43:45.995
It's too much for my mom!

43:47.177 --> 43:49.550
And we can't afford a farm hand.

43:50.607 --> 43:52.685
We're just starting something you and I...

43:55.176 --> 43:58.550
You can't tell me that over the phone
like that, Delphine. We need to meet.

43:58.976 --> 44:01.104
I'm on my way. Where are you?

44:01.609 --> 44:03.629
Not now, Carole.

44:20.174 --> 44:21.624
It's OK.

44:22.316 --> 44:24.754
I'm sure she's gonna come back.

44:24.874 --> 44:26.941
She loves you, it's obvious.

44:29.421 --> 44:30.622
What's going on?

44:30.623 --> 44:32.900
I waited here, because
she's not feeling well.

45:21.390 --> 45:24.210
Did you know the Liéjard brothers
are ready to buy your farm?

45:26.006 --> 45:28.254
Your father had been at the
hospital for less than a day,

45:28.282 --> 45:30.279
and they were already talking
about it to your mother.

45:30.304 --> 45:31.826
Bunch of jerks.

45:32.454 --> 45:34.791
She didn't even tell him. In their dreams!

45:41.954 --> 45:43.201
You changed.

45:44.276 --> 45:45.589
I did?

45:46.447 --> 45:47.976
Yeah, I don't know.

45:48.156 --> 45:49.867
You look less childish, more woman.

45:50.191 --> 45:52.348
Or maybe more Parisian.

45:53.110 --> 45:55.125
That's funny. In Paris, I
always felt like a ninny,

45:55.125 --> 45:57.274
and you tell me I look more Parisian.

46:02.034 --> 46:03.578
You know,

46:03.938 --> 46:06.037
I'm really sorry about Maurice.

46:08.302 --> 46:10.567
But I'm really happy you're here.

46:24.978 --> 46:27.856
Stop going through your father's
things, he doesn't like it.

46:27.864 --> 46:30.054
I have a meeting with the bank.

46:30.055 --> 46:31.255
Why?

46:32.011 --> 46:33.677
To pay the share.

46:34.016 --> 46:36.134
Do you have a health insurance policy?

46:36.135 --> 46:38.985
No. We're not gonna pay two of them.

46:39.591 --> 46:41.543
We're not as rich as the Giscards.

46:45.628 --> 46:47.094
Seven letters.

46:47.564 --> 46:50.156
- How many letters?
- We're going to have to shell out.

47:07.252 --> 47:11.453
Guys, regarding the purchase
of the agricultural equipment:

47:11.470 --> 47:14.990
we're only getting a combine harvester,

47:14.991 --> 47:16.471
- every agrees?
- Yes.

47:16.793 --> 47:19.453
I think it's too expensive.

47:19.455 --> 47:22.131
We should renegotiate the price.

47:22.132 --> 47:24.393
- You're getting cold feet again?
- No, I'm not!

47:24.402 --> 47:26.335
But we're not as rich as Croesus.

47:26.336 --> 47:29.114
Once we've settled on the model we want,

47:29.115 --> 47:31.035
we'll calculate everybody's share,

47:31.036 --> 47:32.717
and we'll get your checks.

47:32.718 --> 47:35.473
- I'll come pick everyone's check...
- Yeah, Antoine will pick them up.

47:35.474 --> 47:38.789
- OK for everyone?
- About Maurice, what do we do?

47:38.790 --> 47:40.117
I'll pay our share.

47:40.580 --> 47:42.857
So, if you pay the share,

47:42.858 --> 47:44.846
I'll have to schedule a
bank appointment for you.

47:44.851 --> 47:46.471
No, that's fine. I have an
appointment early next week.

47:46.472 --> 47:48.001
You took an appointment on your own?

47:48.466 --> 47:49.666
Well, yeah.

47:49.667 --> 47:52.568
It's my role as president of the
cooperative so you should have told me,

47:52.590 --> 47:54.436
and we would have come with you.
You would have been more credible.

47:54.892 --> 47:57.533
I thought it would be faster that way.

47:57.725 --> 47:59.827
Maybe, but that's not how we do it.

47:59.828 --> 48:01.238
It's not correct.

48:01.239 --> 48:04.558
Well, if the appointment
is scheduled, we'll see...

48:04.559 --> 48:07.451
- So...
- We need to appoint drivers too.

48:14.742 --> 48:16.542
Your father woke up!

48:17.300 --> 48:20.111
- What?
- Your father woke up!

48:21.319 --> 48:23.104
They say he's still weak,

48:23.301 --> 48:26.736
but he's conscious. He doesn't
speak but he can understand.

48:35.419 --> 48:37.663
Don't take that many, you're
only leaving for a few days.

48:37.664 --> 48:39.306
He loves the wild boar one.

48:39.359 --> 48:41.284
You know he's a big eater.

48:42.645 --> 48:46.297
Ouch. We look like two
little girls running around.

49:04.824 --> 49:06.862
Kiss him hello for me.

49:10.127 --> 49:12.861
- If you have a problem, call Antoine.
- Yeah, don't worry.

49:14.336 --> 49:16.311
Kiss him for me!

49:46.341 --> 49:48.911
You said working the
land was non-stop work,

49:48.947 --> 49:50.975
but it feels OK to me.

49:51.453 --> 49:55.467
That's because I woke up at 4:00 am
to do everything before you arrive.

49:55.510 --> 49:58.251
Really? You must be exhausted.

49:58.693 --> 50:01.001
No, I'm OK. I still have energy.

50:01.380 --> 50:03.475
What kind of energy?

51:06.811 --> 51:08.540
Come on, go, go, go!

51:08.749 --> 51:09.786
Go, go, go!

51:14.555 --> 51:16.006
Come on, Laura!

51:18.270 --> 51:19.929
Stop! Stop!

51:19.938 --> 51:21.387
Come on, Margot!

51:26.971 --> 51:28.952
What's missing... ah, the jug of water.

52:02.845 --> 52:05.613
When I was a kid, we'd play house,

52:05.733 --> 52:09.246
and I didn't feel anything
when I kissed boys.

52:09.526 --> 52:12.780
One day, there weren't enough
boys, so I played the dad.

52:13.837 --> 52:16.442
I kissed a girl and it
really made an impression.

52:16.731 --> 52:18.610
And then?

52:20.492 --> 52:23.073
Then I slept with a
girl for the first time.

52:23.240 --> 52:24.992
How old were you?

52:26.524 --> 52:28.679
I was 16 and she was 22.

52:28.715 --> 52:30.789
Was she from around here?

52:31.736 --> 52:34.225
No, a city girl, like you.

52:35.612 --> 52:38.338
She was on holidays near our place.

52:38.705 --> 52:41.726
My parents were completely
in the dark. They were happy

52:41.846 --> 52:44.386
that I made friends with a
college girl, from Limoges.

52:45.143 --> 52:46.722
And then?

52:47.172 --> 52:48.557
What "then"?

52:48.724 --> 52:51.974
Don't make me believe there was no
one between your 16 years old and now.

52:53.825 --> 52:56.836
I had a heartache with a girl from here.

52:59.026 --> 53:01.181
And then I met you.

53:43.355 --> 53:44.906
I knew it.

53:46.222 --> 53:48.579
I knew it, but I couldn't
believe you'd do that.

53:49.269 --> 53:51.226
You're pathetic.

53:51.546 --> 53:53.741
You say you're confused,
that you don't wanna break up,

53:53.752 --> 53:56.660
and ten days later you go join her for
the weekend, without even warning me.

53:56.677 --> 53:58.418
You must be joking.

53:59.303 --> 54:01.672
Are you waiting for my approval?

54:04.658 --> 54:06.858
You have no self-discipline, Carole.

54:07.498 --> 54:09.266
None.

54:12.780 --> 54:15.581
Commitment is not just in the
amphitheater with your friends.

54:17.855 --> 54:19.840
It's in your life too.

54:39.536 --> 54:41.095
- Hello.
- Hello.

54:44.368 --> 54:46.198
Let's get him out.

55:03.672 --> 55:05.319
Help me.

55:07.955 --> 55:10.245
Give me his bathrobe.

55:24.391 --> 55:25.834
Thank you.

55:26.564 --> 55:28.205
No need to thank me.

55:34.570 --> 55:36.869
Are you certain of what you're doing?

55:38.303 --> 55:40.593
I just left her and I already miss her.

55:41.503 --> 55:43.766
I really miss her, you know?

55:44.441 --> 55:47.562
I never felt this way
before. So I'm going back,

55:47.607 --> 55:49.897
I don't have a choice.

55:51.042 --> 55:53.512
I never wanted for you to miss me.

55:54.848 --> 55:57.263
What I loved about you is
that you didn't need me,

55:57.299 --> 55:59.454
that you were free, and strong.

56:00.076 --> 56:01.960
So what are you saying now?

56:02.754 --> 56:05.763
That love, for you, is not being
able to stay apart from someone?

56:05.973 --> 56:09.147
Chasing someone, tongue
rolling out, like in cartoons?

56:11.697 --> 56:14.195
- That's not you, Carole.
- Maybe.

56:15.366 --> 56:17.431
I don't know anymore,

56:17.458 --> 56:19.396
I just let myself drift
away by my feelings.

56:19.396 --> 56:21.578
I don't want to debate about this.

56:22.119 --> 56:24.131
You don't have to stop thinking either.

56:33.083 --> 56:34.642
Mom?

56:37.338 --> 56:40.581
A friend from Paris will come visit
us for a few days, if you don't mind.

56:40.701 --> 56:43.457
I don't. Quite the opposite actually.

56:45.489 --> 56:48.422
It's good for you, it'll
take your mind off things.

56:49.375 --> 56:52.709
Between handling the farm and your
father, you deserve some entertainment.

56:54.963 --> 56:56.543
Is she a colleague of yours?

56:57.624 --> 56:58.901
Yeah.

56:59.947 --> 57:02.373
She just left her boyfriend,
so she needs to take a break.

57:02.493 --> 57:04.296
- Do they have kids?
- No.

57:04.491 --> 57:06.150
Oh, it's easier then.

57:06.354 --> 57:08.191
She'll take Grandma's bedroom.

57:08.358 --> 57:10.212
It's the most comfortable one.

57:50.327 --> 57:51.860
Oh my god!

57:52.800 --> 57:55.635
I gotta warn you, we won't
sleep in the same room.

57:55.649 --> 57:56.890
Why?

57:57.018 --> 57:58.794
My dad just had a heart
attack a month ago,

57:58.795 --> 58:01.068
I don't want my mom to have one as well.

58:02.436 --> 58:04.581
We're gonna take it easy, OK?

58:07.060 --> 58:08.418
OK.

58:15.080 --> 58:16.343
Dad.

58:23.974 --> 58:27.011
This is Carole, she came to see me.

58:27.278 --> 58:28.939
Hello, sir.

58:31.520 --> 58:33.028
Delphine told me a lot about you,

58:33.057 --> 58:34.831
I'm really glad to meet you.

58:40.464 --> 58:41.885
See you later.

59:06.977 --> 59:08.959
What kind of work do
you do at Félix Potin?

59:08.990 --> 59:11.312
Oh, but I don't work at Félix Potin at all.

59:11.788 --> 59:13.202
Well, I thought...

59:13.245 --> 59:14.890
I'm a Spanish teacher.

59:14.897 --> 59:16.715
We met at a women's group.

59:17.372 --> 59:18.988
What kind of group?

59:19.240 --> 59:21.751
Uh, a pottery group, just for women.

59:22.458 --> 59:25.481
They're workshops around the material.

59:26.282 --> 59:29.671
We work on the feelings,

59:29.859 --> 59:31.878
we sculpt, we knead.

59:32.297 --> 59:33.837
We work with clay.

59:34.004 --> 59:36.544
It's pleasurable, and very relaxing.

59:36.546 --> 59:38.176
You do that kind of thing?

59:38.218 --> 59:40.177
Oh yeah, and she's very gifted.

59:40.195 --> 59:43.411
She makes cute little vases, you'll see.

59:43.966 --> 59:45.724
- Right, Delphine?
- Hmm.

59:52.059 --> 59:54.115
Is that dessert? Can I?

59:54.235 --> 59:57.359
- I'm gonna get you a plate.
- Oh no, don't bother.

1:01:20.322 --> 1:01:21.702
Shh.

1:02:10.537 --> 1:02:12.412
- Up already?
- Yeah.

1:02:12.579 --> 1:02:14.646
- You didn't sleep well?
- I did, but I'm coming with you.

1:02:14.682 --> 1:02:17.264
- We're gonna go work.
- I know.

1:02:19.348 --> 1:02:21.332
- Do you want some coffee?
- Yes.

1:02:23.863 --> 1:02:25.465
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

1:02:29.013 --> 1:02:30.347
Thank you.

1:03:08.496 --> 1:03:11.013
That's no work for a teacher.

1:03:11.596 --> 1:03:13.026
Oh, am I too slow?

1:03:13.055 --> 1:03:15.604
No, no. It's just that if I
didn't have to do it, I wouldn't.

1:03:15.724 --> 1:03:16.768
Really?

1:03:17.460 --> 1:03:20.022
- But you're proud of what you do?
- Proud? No.

1:03:20.142 --> 1:03:21.335
Why would I be?

1:03:21.367 --> 1:03:24.847
You and your daughter manage to keep
the farm running, that's not nothing.

1:03:26.470 --> 1:03:28.897
It's the proof that a farm
can be managed by women.

1:03:29.155 --> 1:03:32.431
It's true that women are
as good as men for work,

1:03:33.279 --> 1:03:35.148
but that's not how it's done.

1:03:38.622 --> 1:03:40.238
- What?
- Nothing.

1:03:41.339 --> 1:03:42.377
Here.

1:03:42.383 --> 1:03:44.374
It's easier with a man, don't you agree?

1:03:44.432 --> 1:03:45.984
I didn't say anything.

1:03:51.910 --> 1:03:53.681
What do you have against men?

1:03:55.839 --> 1:03:56.699
What?

1:03:57.518 --> 1:03:59.226
- What?
- Nothing...

1:04:01.800 --> 1:04:03.415
What you do is marvelous.

1:04:05.758 --> 1:04:07.836
You should be proud, Monique.

1:04:16.669 --> 1:04:17.667
Got it.

1:04:37.782 --> 1:04:38.936
Look.

1:04:40.904 --> 1:04:42.017
Touch it.

1:05:10.778 --> 1:05:12.428
Ah, Monique!

You're awesome.

1:06:40.179 --> 1:06:42.206
I didn't even touch you yet.

1:06:47.589 --> 1:06:49.572
- Did you feel it?
- No.

1:06:49.606 --> 1:06:51.123
You see.

1:06:54.611 --> 1:06:56.730
- And now?
- No.

1:07:47.164 --> 1:07:50.536
- Did you tell him we made hay?
- He doesn't understand what we say.

1:07:51.793 --> 1:07:54.538
Of course he does. Right, Dad?

1:07:56.377 --> 1:07:58.162
We made hay.

1:07:59.190 --> 1:08:02.057
We have to talk to him.
That's what keeps him alive.

1:08:02.595 --> 1:08:05.197
You can bury your head in
the sand. I see what I see.

1:08:19.737 --> 1:08:21.849
Sorry. Here.

1:08:44.614 --> 1:08:46.139
Do it!

1:08:51.894 --> 1:08:53.808
Come on, Delphine!

- Carole.

1:09:06.495 --> 1:09:09.284
I'm Josette. To Carole and Delphine.

1:09:09.404 --> 1:09:10.830
Cheers.

1:09:10.842 --> 1:09:12.962
- So, was it good in Paris?
- Yeah.

1:09:12.977 --> 1:09:15.681
- I did unexpected things.
- Like what?

1:09:15.801 --> 1:09:17.126
Politics.

1:09:17.246 --> 1:09:18.705
Politics?

1:09:18.886 --> 1:09:20.566
You're gonna do a kolkhoz?

1:09:20.581 --> 1:09:22.506
Maybe not a cooperative, but making sure

1:09:22.507 --> 1:09:25.222
women get a salary for the work
they do would be a great start.

1:09:25.252 --> 1:09:27.843
I do have a salary. My husband's salary.

1:09:28.681 --> 1:09:31.206
It's already nice that
she can dip into it, no?

1:09:31.893 --> 1:09:33.685
Yes.

1:09:46.660 --> 1:09:48.409
It seems nice.

1:09:49.698 --> 1:09:51.520
Do you want a drink?

1:09:51.640 --> 1:09:54.134
No, thanks. I can't right now.

1:09:54.657 --> 1:09:57.371
Well, I feel like drinking tonight.

1:09:57.578 --> 1:09:59.850
It's well deserved, look.

1:10:00.328 --> 1:10:02.492

1:10:02.799 --> 1:10:05.089
How long have you known Delphine?

1:10:06.333 --> 1:10:07.929
Since forever.

1:10:08.191 --> 1:10:10.309
What was she like as a kid?

1:10:11.093 --> 1:10:12.443
Like now.

1:10:18.044 --> 1:10:20.487
You know, you can't know
someone in just three months.

1:10:23.742 --> 1:10:25.852
Delphine won't leave.

1:10:26.447 --> 1:10:28.033
Really?

1:10:28.971 --> 1:10:31.036
How can you be certain?

1:10:31.156 --> 1:10:33.353
Have you seen Maurice?

1:10:34.020 --> 1:10:37.284
He'll never be able to handle the farm.

1:10:37.645 --> 1:10:40.890
And Delphine would rather
die than sell it. I know that.

I doubt I'll wake up your dad.

1:11:12.201 --> 1:11:13.332
Hello!

1:11:13.452 --> 1:11:15.313
Stop, please.

1:11:15.329 --> 1:11:17.657
Sorry, we drank a little bit too much.

1:11:34.964 --> 1:11:39.635
"Relax, we're gonna work
on our own today. I love you."

1:12:18.022 --> 1:12:21.562
I can't figure out if Delphine
really likes this life,

1:12:21.926 --> 1:12:25.048
or if she can't imagine something else.

1:12:26.233 --> 1:12:29.016
I'm sure she could do
a ton of other things.

1:12:29.602 --> 1:12:31.962
Your daughter's smart.

1:12:32.507 --> 1:12:34.367
But you know that.

1:12:35.148 --> 1:12:37.472
She's an egg-head.

1:12:45.696 --> 1:12:47.520
You know...

1:12:48.845 --> 1:12:50.978
I'm not here to make hay.

1:12:51.098 --> 1:12:53.392
Or to be on holidays in the countryside.

1:12:53.420 --> 1:12:56.107
I don't care about the countryside at all.

1:12:59.174 --> 1:13:01.243
I came here because of your daughter.

1:13:03.304 --> 1:13:05.439
Because I love her.

1:13:06.781 --> 1:13:08.859
There, I said it.

1:13:10.375 --> 1:13:12.613
I'm crazy about her.

1:13:13.052 --> 1:13:16.011
I never thought I could
love someone like this.

1:13:24.463 --> 1:13:26.460
I've got it.

1:14:17.471 --> 1:14:19.151
Delphine.

1:14:19.359 --> 1:14:21.766
Don't you miss Paris?

1:14:22.763 --> 1:14:25.227
No, not really.

1:14:25.868 --> 1:14:28.909
When we met, you seemed to like it.

1:14:30.107 --> 1:14:32.448
That's because you were there.

1:14:32.568 --> 1:14:35.654
If you had been on Mars, I
would have liked Mars too.

1:14:36.197 --> 1:14:38.574
You're a sweet-talker.

1:14:40.972 --> 1:14:43.650
I didn't think one day, I'd miss Paris.

1:14:46.500 --> 1:14:48.667
The smell of fumes.

1:14:49.777 --> 1:14:51.592
The car horns.

1:14:53.571 --> 1:14:56.866
The coffee I drink at the
bar before going to work.

1:14:59.943 --> 1:15:01.795
Sitting between a worker and a boss,

1:15:01.822 --> 1:15:04.309
and everyone has the same
status for five minutes.

1:15:08.730 --> 1:15:10.963
I even miss the cops.

1:15:17.126 --> 1:15:20.439
Oh no, don't throw all
that. You're wasting it.

1:15:21.780 --> 1:15:23.953
- Ah, really?
- Yeah, let me do it.

1:15:32.627 --> 1:15:34.468
Hello, Monique.

1:15:34.588 --> 1:15:36.757
- Hello, Antoine.
- How are you?

1:15:37.320 --> 1:15:39.426
- Hi.
- Hello.

1:15:42.881 --> 1:15:44.557
If only...

1:15:44.723 --> 1:15:46.934
she were to marry him. That'd be nice.

1:15:48.172 --> 1:15:50.314
Why do you say that?

1:15:51.331 --> 1:15:54.498
When she left for Paris, I
thought it would never happen.

1:15:54.618 --> 1:15:58.779
I thought Antoine would get
bored. But now that she's back...

1:15:58.946 --> 1:16:00.990
I don't see what's stopping them.

1:16:02.057 --> 1:16:03.972
Did he ask her?

1:16:03.999 --> 1:16:07.258
He's waiting for her.
That's his way of asking her.

1:16:10.499 --> 1:16:13.294
And are you sure Delphine knows that?

1:16:13.503 --> 1:16:15.092
Everybody knows.

1:16:15.212 --> 1:16:17.316
And she's got eyes.

1:16:39.034 --> 1:16:41.643
Carole, what are you doing? I've
been looking for you everywhere.

1:16:41.644 --> 1:16:45.103
Unless I'm abducted by aliens, I
can't see what could happen to me here.

1:16:45.610 --> 1:16:47.761
Why are you pissed off?

1:16:47.786 --> 1:16:50.993
Do you realize that your mom thinks
you're going to marry Antoine?

1:16:50.998 --> 1:16:53.106
Do you realize that?

1:16:54.232 --> 1:16:57.500
So what. It makes her happy.
She's allowed to dream.

1:16:57.504 --> 1:16:58.928
Yeah, right.

1:16:58.937 --> 1:17:01.885
You keep her hoping because
it works out well for you.

1:17:03.049 --> 1:17:05.312
What do you want me to say
to her? That we're together?

1:17:05.313 --> 1:17:08.242
Yeah! You can't lie to her your whole life.

1:17:09.350 --> 1:17:11.449
Maybe she'll stop thinking I'm a Parisian

1:17:11.456 --> 1:17:14.078
who wants to get back to nature.

1:17:15.348 --> 1:17:18.612
I can't rush her out of nowhere. She
doesn't even know such things exist.

1:17:18.629 --> 1:17:21.332
Oh right. Keep thinking
your mom's an idiot.

1:17:21.452 --> 1:17:23.038
It's convenient for you.

1:17:27.849 --> 1:17:29.280
Carole.

1:17:34.992 --> 1:17:36.217
Carole.

1:17:37.871 --> 1:17:39.922
Please, open the door.

1:17:40.964 --> 1:17:42.453
Carole.

1:18:18.380 --> 1:18:19.782
Oh, shut up.

1:18:20.152 --> 1:18:21.793
No comments.

1:18:22.759 --> 1:18:24.133
What?

1:18:26.476 --> 1:18:29.199
What are you trying to do exactly?

1:18:29.639 --> 1:18:31.849
Your mom asked me to set this up.

1:18:31.934 --> 1:18:33.767
You're doing it wrong.

1:18:40.641 --> 1:18:42.434
You're good at that.

1:18:43.393 --> 1:18:45.390
Monique is fond of you now.

1:18:45.600 --> 1:18:47.286
She's always asking you to do things.

1:18:47.292 --> 1:18:49.116
Yeah, she likes me.

1:18:49.137 --> 1:18:52.325
It's a good thing she doesn't
know all the dirty we're doing.

1:18:58.091 --> 1:18:59.543
Carole.

1:19:17.727 --> 1:19:19.813
- Hello.
- Hello.

1:19:25.185 --> 1:19:26.855
He's gonna spread rumors around:

1:19:26.862 --> 1:19:29.876
"Maurice's daughter is
a lesbian, hide your... "

1:19:30.304 --> 1:19:32.242
Stop, it's not funny.

1:19:36.339 --> 1:19:37.790
Delphine.

1:21:17.198 --> 1:21:18.807
It's stuck.

1:21:20.901 --> 1:21:23.007
I can't put my hand in it.

1:21:23.297 --> 1:21:24.959
Ah, that's it, I got it.

1:21:28.781 --> 1:21:30.959
He's coming, he's coming!

1:21:31.368 --> 1:21:33.572
Yes! Yes, come on!

1:21:34.524 --> 1:21:36.730
- Come on, girl!
- Keep going!

1:21:36.775 --> 1:21:38.481
Yeah.

1:21:38.601 --> 1:21:40.288
Yes!

1:21:44.137 --> 1:21:46.760
Here you go. Your baby.

1:21:57.480 --> 1:22:00.040
You scared us, girl.

1:22:00.440 --> 1:22:02.427
It was off to a bad start.

1:22:02.547 --> 1:22:04.520
Thanks, Antoine.

1:22:21.470 --> 1:22:24.325
- A coffee, Antoine?
- Yes, please.

1:22:24.445 --> 1:22:26.714
- Coffee?
- Yeah.

1:23:03.029 --> 1:23:05.217
I can't stand it. I'm going home.

1:23:05.843 --> 1:23:07.803
Whatever.

1:23:07.923 --> 1:23:09.646
Go back to Manuel too.

1:23:09.766 --> 1:23:12.596
I left him for you, remember?

1:23:13.077 --> 1:23:15.655
Did you ever wonder if
that wouldn't bother me?

1:23:15.656 --> 1:23:17.925
- You turning up like this?
- What?

1:23:17.926 --> 1:23:20.902
What was I going to tell my folks,
I'm just supposed to be out and proud?

1:23:22.054 --> 1:23:23.870
That's small.

1:23:24.396 --> 1:23:26.310
That's very small of you.

1:23:26.783 --> 1:23:30.115
I'm not like you. I do
care what people think.

1:23:37.040 --> 1:23:39.528
Say you're ashamed of
me while you're at it!

1:23:43.094 --> 1:23:45.101
Shit, I...

1:23:45.346 --> 1:23:48.915
I kept my mouth shut, I
said yes to everything...

1:23:53.083 --> 1:23:56.287
It's not other people who look at
you. You're monitoring yourself.

1:23:56.651 --> 1:23:58.693
You're your own guardian.

1:23:58.813 --> 1:24:01.637
- Your own guardian!
- I can't do everything at once!

1:24:03.020 --> 1:24:05.725
I can't manage the farm and be with you!

1:24:06.561 --> 1:24:09.928
You keep saying women must be independent.

1:24:09.937 --> 1:24:12.533
Well, I fight everyday
so that this farm exists.

1:24:14.107 --> 1:24:16.682
- That's concrete!
- Yeah, great! Congrats!

1:24:16.719 --> 1:24:18.471
You're a pioneer, good for you!

1:24:18.761 --> 1:24:20.280
Great!

1:24:20.821 --> 1:24:24.252
You fight more for your farm than for us!

1:24:29.444 --> 1:24:31.704
You're heartless, Delphine.

1:24:32.626 --> 1:24:35.015
All I sacrificed for you!

1:24:37.439 --> 1:24:39.216
Don't you get it?

1:24:40.788 --> 1:24:42.994
I'm here for you!

1:25:14.629 --> 1:25:16.980
Delphine, you found your place?

1:25:17.100 --> 1:25:18.839
Yeah.

1:25:21.047 --> 1:25:22.844
- You good?
- Yeah, you?

1:25:22.881 --> 1:25:24.914
Have you seen it?

1:26:20.559 --> 1:26:23.645
Where were you? We didn't even toast.

1:26:24.053 --> 1:26:26.341
It's a nice machine.

1:26:26.813 --> 1:26:28.465
Yeah, it's nice.

1:26:30.344 --> 1:26:31.778
Kiss me.

1:26:31.778 --> 1:26:33.663
- What?
- Kiss me.

1:26:36.690 --> 1:26:38.759
Why do you do that?

1:26:38.879 --> 1:26:40.619
You have a finger in every pie?

1:26:40.757 --> 1:26:41.796
What?

1:26:41.797 --> 1:26:44.257
I saw you with your girl friend.
I know why she's here.

1:26:44.531 --> 1:26:46.471
What do you mean, what did you see?

1:26:46.472 --> 1:26:48.847
Don't take me for a fool,
it's even worse!

1:26:49.261 --> 1:26:51.014
Stop.

1:26:59.917 --> 1:27:01.483
Antoine.

1:27:01.842 --> 1:27:04.890
- Antoine.
- What game are you playing? Huh?

1:27:04.892 --> 1:27:06.535
What do you want?

1:27:06.655 --> 1:27:08.795
You want me to cover for you?

1:27:13.888 --> 1:27:15.740
I won't say a word.

1:27:15.860 --> 1:27:18.653
Don't worry about that.
You mean too much for me.

1:27:27.422 --> 1:27:30.299
It took you a while to see that machine.

1:27:41.700 --> 1:27:43.570
You better?

1:27:45.131 --> 1:27:47.173
- Uh?
- Yeah.

1:27:51.921 --> 1:27:53.882
My little cowboy.

1:28:07.190 --> 1:28:10.185
It's gonna be OK. It's gonna be OK.

1:28:10.875 --> 1:28:12.463
It's OK.

1:28:12.490 --> 1:28:14.487
Shh.

1:28:23.991 --> 1:28:25.483
Delphine.

1:28:26.632 --> 1:28:28.236
Delphine.

1:28:36.426 --> 1:28:37.913
07:30 am.

1:28:40.889 --> 1:28:43.494
- Fuck.
- Well, now she knows.

1:28:43.531 --> 1:28:45.446
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

1:28:46.044 --> 1:28:49.185
It's not happening. Fuck!

1:28:58.984 --> 1:29:01.208
Don't fucking laugh!

1:29:29.175 --> 1:29:31.662
You weren't awake, so I did the milking.

1:29:34.159 --> 1:29:35.762
Thanks.

1:29:36.946 --> 1:29:39.405
I forgot the alarm clock.
It won't happen tomorrow.

1:29:40.059 --> 1:29:41.768
I hope.

1:30:18.365 --> 1:30:20.849
I'm sorry.

1:30:24.891 --> 1:30:27.805
- I'm gonna go to the market.
- OK.

1:30:28.222 --> 1:30:30.573
That gives you two hours to leave.

1:30:31.617 --> 1:30:34.676
When I'm back, it has to be
as if you were never here.

1:30:36.918 --> 1:30:39.396
- You think Delphine will be OK with this?
- This is my house!

1:30:39.516 --> 1:30:42.882
So I want you to get out, to leave.

1:30:43.002 --> 1:30:45.098
- Let's talk about this.
- No.

1:30:45.218 --> 1:30:48.293
My daughter's sane. She's a good girl.

1:30:48.329 --> 1:30:50.581
You damaged her. You're...

1:30:51.788 --> 1:30:53.440
You're nasty.

1:30:53.657 --> 1:30:55.600
I'm the same person

1:30:55.609 --> 1:30:58.233
you've been working with
all these weeks, Monique.

1:30:58.737 --> 1:31:01.279
You didn't think I was nasty back then.

1:31:01.316 --> 1:31:03.770
Because I didn't know! You're a liar

1:31:03.808 --> 1:31:06.436
- on top of being a pervert!
- Yes, we lied to you.

1:31:06.486 --> 1:31:08.745
But Delphine was afraid to hurt you.

1:31:08.774 --> 1:31:10.688
And I agreed to lie, because I love her.

1:31:11.264 --> 1:31:12.513
Shut up!

1:31:12.848 --> 1:31:14.773
Shut up. What are you gonna do now?

1:31:14.831 --> 1:31:17.014
You're gonna tell me
the nasty things you did?

1:31:17.040 --> 1:31:19.784
All the disgusting
things? I don't wanna know!

1:31:20.670 --> 1:31:23.415
It's not disgusting! I'm
talking about your daughter!

1:31:23.453 --> 1:31:26.552
Get out! You're the devil in my house!

1:31:26.574 --> 1:31:28.244
Stop! Stop it!

1:31:28.571 --> 1:31:32.253
- The devil in my house.
- Stop, Monique.

1:31:41.830 --> 1:31:43.473
Delphine!

1:31:48.336 --> 1:31:50.159
Delphine! I'm leaving!

1:31:50.217 --> 1:31:52.243
I'm catching a train, I can't stay here.

1:31:52.548 --> 1:31:54.219
I can't...

1:31:55.824 --> 1:31:57.566
She threw me out!

1:32:01.349 --> 1:32:02.496
Carole.

1:32:06.329 --> 1:32:07.905
If you leave, I leave.

1:32:08.297 --> 1:32:11.918
I'm coming with you,
Carole. I'm coming with you!

1:32:30.906 --> 1:32:33.927
"Mom, I'm leaving with Carole."

1:32:34.566 --> 1:32:38.008
"I was too afraid to tell you about
myself, but I hope one day you'll get it."

1:32:38.128 --> 1:32:40.212
"Forgive me for hurting you."

1:32:42.201 --> 1:32:44.539
"You and Dad will always be in my heart."

1:32:46.137 --> 1:32:48.860
"I'm still your daughter. Delphine."

1:33:01.146 --> 1:33:03.137
Adeline won't believe it.

1:33:03.754 --> 1:33:06.485
I'll grab my things,
and we'll find a place.

1:33:30.354 --> 1:33:32.765
The connection is in 45 minutes.

1:33:33.128 --> 1:33:35.103
There's not even a café around.

1:33:35.913 --> 1:33:37.634
I'm so hungry.

1:33:38.353 --> 1:33:40.198
When we arrive, I'll take
you to the restaurant.

1:33:40.408 --> 1:33:42.020
A great one.

1:33:45.266 --> 1:33:46.798
You're not hungry?

1:33:47.060 --> 1:33:48.374
Not really.

1:34:11.678 --> 1:34:13.385
Carole, I can't.

1:34:13.399 --> 1:34:14.707
What?

1:34:15.055 --> 1:34:17.176
I don't want to hurt you, but I can't.

1:34:20.044 --> 1:34:23.065
That's not possible. You can't
change your mind like this...

1:34:23.290 --> 1:34:26.469
in an hour, for something this important.

1:34:27.364 --> 1:34:29.847
I can't do it. I can't.

1:34:36.289 --> 1:34:38.191
Come with me, I'm begging you.

1:34:39.571 --> 1:34:41.031
Delphine.

1:34:42.396 --> 1:34:44.567
What was the chance for us to meet?

1:34:44.603 --> 1:34:46.035
One in a million?

1:34:46.063 --> 1:34:49.832
One in two millions? We were at
the same place at the same time.

1:34:49.952 --> 1:34:52.852
If you have gotten in the bus five minutes
earlier, you would have never seen me.

1:34:52.869 --> 1:34:55.983
We would have never met. It's a sign!

1:34:57.108 --> 1:34:59.017
I do believe in signs!

1:35:01.284 --> 1:35:03.114
Let's catch this train.

1:35:07.297 --> 1:35:10.034
- Carole.
- We have to go.

1:35:10.154 --> 1:35:11.906
Train's coming.

1:35:12.341 --> 1:35:14.411
Let's go. Take your suitcase.

1:35:18.905 --> 1:35:20.398
Come on.

1:35:21.128 --> 1:35:22.817
Delphine!

1:37:06.296 --> 1:37:08.423
You missed your train?

1:37:11.279 --> 1:37:13.294
No, I came back.

1:37:14.927 --> 1:37:16.264
I'm here.

1:37:20.165 --> 1:37:21.978
You're back?

1:37:29.251 --> 1:37:30.948
And the other one?

1:37:32.530 --> 1:37:34.607
Carole is back in Paris, she won't return.

1:38:07.920 --> 1:38:09.746
Do your parents know?

1:38:11.869 --> 1:38:14.712
- Are you afraid?
- No.

1:38:25.522 --> 1:38:27.337
Is it gonna hurt?

1:38:27.457 --> 1:38:29.795
No, don't worry.

1:38:30.378 --> 1:38:33.328
The doctor is going to
do a suction aspiration.

1:38:33.555 --> 1:38:35.683
It's a simple,

1:38:35.718 --> 1:38:38.210
less risky, and painless abortion.

1:38:38.776 --> 1:38:42.371
You're three weeks, so you
came here at the right time.

1:38:43.373 --> 1:38:45.065
Is everything clear to you?

1:38:45.185 --> 1:38:47.047
Yes, I think. Thanks.

1:38:47.636 --> 1:38:51.630
Now, did you ever think
about going on the pill?

1:38:51.750 --> 1:38:53.198
I don't know.

1:38:53.242 --> 1:38:55.536
Take a pill every day...

1:38:55.656 --> 1:38:59.298
we don't really know what
it does, how it works.

1:38:59.320 --> 1:39:01.368
I can explain to you how it works,

1:39:01.390 --> 1:39:03.463
that way you'll stop imagining things.

1:39:04.604 --> 1:39:06.477
Are you on the pill?

1:39:07.022 --> 1:39:08.881
No, I'm not.

1:39:08.918 --> 1:39:11.081
Why don't you if it's that good?

1:39:11.814 --> 1:39:15.350
I don't take the pill because
I don't need contraception.

1:39:17.885 --> 1:39:19.693
I'm with a woman.

1:39:21.088 --> 1:39:22.288
You remember Coralie,

1:39:22.289 --> 1:39:24.479
- we saw her three weeks ago?
- Mm-hm.

1:39:24.505 --> 1:39:26.382
- She's staying at my place.
- Ugh.

1:39:26.818 --> 1:39:28.396
Don't "Ugh" me.

1:39:28.563 --> 1:39:33.484
She had nowhere to go, and I didn't
want to send her to some shelter.

1:39:33.680 --> 1:39:34.944
Sigrid.

1:39:35.111 --> 1:39:36.722
You're too nice.

1:39:36.842 --> 1:39:38.610
It's a quality too.

1:39:39.198 --> 1:39:41.515
One day, you'll let
people walk all over you.

1:39:41.537 --> 1:39:43.995
It's only the third time.

1:39:44.161 --> 1:39:47.579
But the timing's good, I
was starting to feel lonely.

1:39:47.971 --> 1:39:49.750
You OK?

1:39:51.152 --> 1:39:52.916
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

1:39:53.308 --> 1:39:54.819
Excuse me a minute.

1:40:02.858 --> 1:40:04.307
"Dear Carole,

1:40:06.351 --> 1:40:08.543
I hope you get this letter.

1:40:09.713 --> 1:40:12.137
I wanted to tell you that
I left my parents' farm.

1:40:12.632 --> 1:40:15.123
What I couldn't do when
you were there by my side,

1:40:15.160 --> 1:40:17.411
I did it a few years later.

1:40:17.999 --> 1:40:19.865
I thought about you a lot.

1:40:19.923 --> 1:40:22.168
I follow the movement's news.

1:40:22.288 --> 1:40:24.630
I still can't believe
everything you achieved.

1:40:25.065 --> 1:40:27.273
Now I wonder what cause you're fighting,

1:40:27.309 --> 1:40:29.618
who you're living with, what you became.

1:40:29.879 --> 1:40:32.689
I live in the south now.
I've got my own farm.

1:40:32.726 --> 1:40:34.853
It's small but it's mine.

1:40:36.415 --> 1:40:38.361
I wish I could go back in time.

1:40:38.739 --> 1:40:40.700
Go back to that day on the train,

1:40:40.820 --> 1:40:44.618
and have the courage I
lacked back then, but...

1:40:46.056 --> 1:40:47.734
that's not possible.

1:40:49.310 --> 1:40:51.016
I cried a lot after you left.

1:40:51.808 --> 1:40:53.797
But at least, I understand that

1:40:53.917 --> 1:40:55.954
we can't go back.

1:40:56.074 --> 1:40:58.111
We can only move forward.

1:40:58.402 --> 1:41:00.595
That's what I'm trying to do now.

1:41:08.685 --> 1:41:10.050
Love.

1:41:10.094 --> 1:41:11.582
Delphine."
