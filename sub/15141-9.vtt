00:00.000 --> 00:01.602
WOMAN:
 Previously on East Los High...

00:01.668 --> 00:04.404
I want everyone to see I got
the hottest girl in East Los.

00:04.471 --> 00:05.639
I'm glad we did this.

00:05.706 --> 00:07.107
( dramatic theme playing )

00:09.176 --> 00:10.644
What's this?
No, baby, wait.

00:10.711 --> 00:12.579
There was another girl
in the car, but not with me,

00:12.646 --> 00:15.716
with my dad.
He's having an affair?

00:15.782 --> 00:18.352
Why the hell would you
get back with Pedro?

00:18.418 --> 00:20.454
CECI:
 You should've seen him.
He was sorry.

00:20.521 --> 00:23.590
Yeah, till the next beating.
Why can't you be happy for me?

00:23.657 --> 00:26.026
Pedro's okay now.

00:26.093 --> 00:28.729
I want to legally
adopt Isela.

00:28.795 --> 00:30.597
And work on giving her
a baby brother.

00:30.664 --> 00:34.535
Pedro, another baby?
I don't know what to say.

00:34.601 --> 00:36.570
Gotta use a condom,
I'm out of birth control.

00:36.637 --> 00:39.139
No, no, no, babe.
We don't need that, babe.

00:39.206 --> 00:41.241
I love you.

00:41.308 --> 00:44.578
I said, "I love you."

00:44.645 --> 00:46.547
And I love you.

00:50.517 --> 00:53.153
Good to see you, girl.
Hey, you too.

00:53.220 --> 00:54.721
Here's your emergency
contraception pill.

00:54.788 --> 00:57.624
Take it as soon as possible.
Yeah, I know, Juana.

00:57.691 --> 01:00.194
How much do I owe you?
There's no charge for the Ella.

01:00.260 --> 01:02.296
You qualify for free
birth control here.

01:02.362 --> 01:04.464
And if you apply for
the Affordable Healthcare Act,

01:04.531 --> 01:07.167
it can all be free,
even at the pharmacy.

01:07.234 --> 01:09.102
No shit?
No shit.

01:09.169 --> 01:12.005
Now, remember, your new
birth control pills

01:12.072 --> 01:16.410
won't take effect
for four weeks. So use condoms.

01:16.476 --> 01:19.079
I will.
There are other options,

01:19.146 --> 01:22.082
like an IUD, so you don't
gotta take the pill every day.

01:22.149 --> 01:24.084
Well, now that I know
that it's free,

01:24.151 --> 01:26.520
I'm gonna switch to an IUD
as soon as possible.

01:26.587 --> 01:29.189
Man, thank you so much, girl.
Mm-hm.

01:29.256 --> 01:30.457
Bye.

01:36.263 --> 01:39.366
ZAC:
If you were a super hero, would
you wear something like this?

01:39.433 --> 01:41.268
Hm, I don't know,

01:41.335 --> 01:43.070
but I'm gonna wear this
Saturday night.

01:46.273 --> 01:48.141
You're gonna look
real nice.

01:48.208 --> 01:52.179
Me and Diego are going to his
cousin's wedding in Bakersfield.

01:52.246 --> 01:54.248
You're still gonna
cover for me, right?

01:54.314 --> 01:56.583
Yeah, for Saturday.

01:56.650 --> 01:58.518
And Sunday.

01:58.585 --> 02:00.654
You guys are
spending the night?

02:00.721 --> 02:03.624
None of your business.

02:03.690 --> 02:06.793
It kinda is since you're
asking me to cover for you.

02:07.060 --> 02:10.197
Yeah, we are.
So?

02:10.264 --> 02:12.032
Isn't that a big deal?

02:12.099 --> 02:15.102
What, spending the night
in Bakersfield?

02:15.168 --> 02:17.404
You know what
I'm talking about.

02:17.471 --> 02:21.341
Yeah, okay, I do.
Why do you care so much?

02:21.408 --> 02:23.343
Who says that I care?

02:31.551 --> 02:33.320
Wow...

02:33.387 --> 02:35.555
I told myself I'd never do that,

02:35.622 --> 02:37.758
but you bring out
the bad girl in me.

02:39.726 --> 02:41.328
What's wrong?

02:41.395 --> 02:43.797
What's wrong with you?

02:44.064 --> 02:45.699
Left a earring in my car
for Gina to find.

02:45.766 --> 02:49.069
Dude, if I wanted Gina to know
about us, she'd know by now.

02:49.136 --> 02:51.672
Whatever. We're done.
Stay away from me.

02:51.738 --> 02:55.309
You dick. You should've
told me before we did that.

02:55.375 --> 02:57.077
You loved it.

02:58.712 --> 03:01.682
Yeah and Gina's gonna
love this.

To give Josh a ride.

03:52.466 --> 03:54.701
She probably wants
to be alone right now.

03:54.768 --> 03:57.771
Camila...
we gotta have her back.

04:34.141 --> 04:37.611

How ya doin', sis?

04:37.677 --> 04:41.448
Don't touch her.
She's allergic to men.

04:42.749 --> 04:44.651
Give these huevones
my pancakes.

04:44.718 --> 04:47.187

Ooh, este hombre,

on to something.

It's been bad, huh?

05:04.004 --> 05:06.440
I'm fine.

05:06.506 --> 05:09.409
Why didn't you tell me
you were gay?

05:09.476 --> 05:11.144
Or at least Camila?

05:11.211 --> 05:13.613
Oh, she knew.

05:13.680 --> 05:16.583
You knew? That's not
what you said last night.

05:18.752 --> 05:22.088
Yeah, 'cause I was just trying
to protect her privacy...

05:22.155 --> 05:24.157
just like
she protects mine.

05:35.168 --> 05:37.270

05:37.337 --> 05:39.339
( hip hop song playing

05:46.713 --> 05:48.682
Okay, good.
Let's do it again.

05:48.748 --> 05:51.151
Again? Why?
Because we are this close

05:51.218 --> 05:53.520
to Regionals.
Now take it from the top.

05:53.587 --> 05:57.324
Come on, Tiffany. You look
like your dog just died.

05:57.390 --> 05:59.226
Smile.
You gotta sell this.

05:59.292 --> 06:01.561
You know what?
I'm gonna take a pee break.

06:01.628 --> 06:04.097
Just do whatever
the hell you want.

06:05.298 --> 06:06.500
You wanna get
something to eat?

06:06.566 --> 06:08.768
Yeah, let me just
get my money.

06:13.073 --> 06:15.308
( dramatic theme playing )

06:15.375 --> 06:17.210
Whose earring is this?

06:17.277 --> 06:18.645
Fili, Is this yours?

06:18.712 --> 06:20.647
I wish.
Where's the other one?

06:20.714 --> 06:22.482
Tiff, is this yours?

06:22.549 --> 06:24.117
Beauty queens
don't wear trash.

06:24.184 --> 06:25.652
Then whose is it?

06:25.719 --> 06:28.388
Who cares, girl.
It's yours now. Let's go eat.

06:28.455 --> 06:29.689
Yeah.

06:33.527 --> 06:35.128
CECI:
 Five, six, seven, eight.

06:47.140 --> 06:49.142
( dramatic theme playing )

06:50.644 --> 06:53.413
Great. Now Tiffany has it,
and Gina doesn't.

06:53.480 --> 06:55.782
What are you doing?
Get it together.

06:56.049 --> 06:58.518
FILIBERTA: Gina, what's wrong?
Are you okay?

06:58.585 --> 07:01.688
GIRL 1: You got your period?
GIRL 2: Feeling sick?

07:01.755 --> 07:03.156
CECI:
We don't have time for this.

07:03.223 --> 07:04.491
GIRL:
Want us to take it from the top?

07:04.558 --> 07:06.393
CECI:
Yes.

07:13.900 --> 07:15.268
Hey, baby.

07:15.535 --> 07:16.969
Don't "hey baby" me.

07:17.036 --> 07:18.237
What's this?

07:20.039 --> 07:21.741
An earring.

07:21.808 --> 07:24.010
Yeah, it matches the one
I found in your car.

07:25.845 --> 07:28.214
You're right.

07:28.281 --> 07:29.615
Where'd you find it?

07:29.682 --> 07:31.517
In the gym
during practice.

07:33.152 --> 07:34.921
Oh, shit.
What?

07:37.757 --> 07:39.225
My dad's hooking up
with a high school girl.

07:39.292 --> 07:41.928
They're getting younger
and younger.

07:41.994 --> 07:43.596
I'm gonna find out
who it is.

07:43.663 --> 07:45.598
Please don't. My dad
could go to jail for this.

07:45.665 --> 07:47.066
I'll take care of it.

07:47.133 --> 07:48.968
I can't believe
that your father is--

07:49.035 --> 07:52.238
I know, and swear you won't
say anything on Saturday.

07:52.505 --> 07:55.174
It'll break my mom's heart.

07:55.241 --> 07:57.543
I think I'm going
to ask her out. I feel it.

07:57.610 --> 07:58.778
You should do it.

07:58.845 --> 08:00.780
DIEGO:
I'm telling you, man,

08:00.847 --> 08:02.682
that was a close call.

08:02.748 --> 08:06.219
Tiffany, what a psycho bitch.
You know what she did?

08:06.285 --> 08:08.254
She left an earring in my car
for Gina to find.

08:08.521 --> 08:10.123
And after I convinced her
it wasn't mine,

08:10.189 --> 08:12.625
Tiffany left another earring,
and Gina found it.

08:12.692 --> 08:14.527
Is she crazy or what?

08:14.594 --> 08:17.163
Who? Gina or Tiffany?
Tiffany!

08:17.230 --> 08:19.599
And if Gina ever asks, tell her
my dad's a sex addict.

08:19.665 --> 08:21.968
I'm not telling her shit.

08:22.034 --> 08:25.171
Dude, what's wrong with you?
You've always been my wingman.

08:27.106 --> 08:28.975
You gotta break up with Gina.

08:29.041 --> 08:31.577
Did one better,
broke up with Tiffany.

08:31.644 --> 08:33.679
Tiffany?
She's hot like I said,

08:33.746 --> 08:35.281
but she's a psycho bitch.

08:35.548 --> 08:38.284
From now on, it's gonna be
all about Gina...

08:38.551 --> 08:42.088
especially this weekend.
Know what I'm saying, playa?

08:51.998 --> 08:53.966
( girls chattering )

08:59.138 --> 09:01.941
Hey, were you looking
at my ass?

09:02.008 --> 09:04.610
It's so wide, I got no choice.

09:04.677 --> 09:08.915
Wait, aren't you supposed to be
in the boys' locker room?

09:08.981 --> 09:10.850
You know I don't like
looking at dicks, stupid...

09:10.917 --> 09:12.852
unlike your boyfriend.

09:12.919 --> 09:15.054
Hey, why don't you get
the hell out of here?

09:17.023 --> 09:20.026
Ooh, girlfriend
to the rescue?

09:20.092 --> 09:22.628
What, you like love her
or something?

09:22.695 --> 09:26.199
Ha, ha, ha.
Forget it. Let's go.

09:26.265 --> 09:29.535
( speaking in Spanish )

09:29.602 --> 09:31.504
( speaking
in Spanish )

09:34.140 --> 09:36.042
( sighs )

09:36.108 --> 09:38.844
Look, I'm sorry
for taking off to Vegas.

09:42.148 --> 09:44.116
And I'm sorry I outed you.

09:44.183 --> 09:46.252
You did me a favor.

09:46.519 --> 09:49.655
Feels great not having
to lie anymore.

09:49.722 --> 09:52.191
You should try it sometime.

09:54.827 --> 09:58.297
Look, can we just be cool?
We still have work and school.

09:58.564 --> 09:59.799
Not work.

10:01.834 --> 10:03.836
What you mean?

10:03.903 --> 10:05.771
Well, you chose Vegas,

10:05.838 --> 10:07.173
so you lost your job.

10:17.116 --> 10:20.052
Hey, wait up.
Hey.

10:20.119 --> 10:22.855
Did you know?
Know what?

10:22.922 --> 10:25.024
Diego's dad is cheating
on his mom.

10:27.693 --> 10:29.962
Look, I know I'm not supposed
to say anything, but...

10:30.029 --> 10:32.531
I think it's one of
the Bomb Squad girls.

10:32.598 --> 10:36.235
I found her earring.
Can you believe that?

10:36.502 --> 10:38.804
No, and you shouldn't either.

10:38.871 --> 10:40.139
Why not?

10:40.206 --> 10:41.807
The man just had
a triple bypass.

10:41.874 --> 10:43.643
He'd be dead if he did
a Bomb Squad girl.

10:45.511 --> 10:46.846
So...

10:46.912 --> 10:49.248
what are trying to say?

10:49.515 --> 10:52.618
I'm not saying anything.
Hey!

10:52.685 --> 10:53.953
Do you think Diego's
cheating on me?

10:54.020 --> 10:55.521
You know what,
leave me out of it.

10:58.791 --> 10:59.959
( dramatic theme playing )

11:00.026 --> 11:02.194
( school bell ringing )

11:06.132 --> 11:09.669
Diego?
What's up?

11:09.735 --> 11:11.871
I talked to Zac.
What'd he say?

11:13.906 --> 11:15.241
Are you cheating on me?

11:16.842 --> 11:19.612
Diego, are you cheating on me?

11:19.679 --> 11:21.013
You know we've been dating
a long time,

11:21.080 --> 11:22.982
and you haven't been
giving it up, and--

11:23.049 --> 11:24.617
What does that have
to do with anything?

11:24.684 --> 11:26.018
Please, let me finish.

11:26.085 --> 11:27.920
I'm trying to tell you
that I'm not perfect.

11:27.987 --> 11:29.622
I have needs.

11:31.190 --> 11:33.626
A while back,
I gave a girl a ride home.

11:33.693 --> 11:35.695
She came on to me.

11:35.761 --> 11:37.830
What girl?
Did you screw her?

11:37.897 --> 11:39.265
No, of course not!

11:39.532 --> 11:42.101
We kissed, but then I stopped.
That's it, I swear.

11:42.168 --> 11:44.770
You kissed her?

11:44.837 --> 11:46.238
Who is she?
She's nobody.

11:46.505 --> 11:48.874
She didn't mean anything.

11:48.941 --> 11:50.810
Gina, I love you.

11:50.876 --> 11:52.178
Then you should've
told me the truth.

11:52.244 --> 11:53.713
I've been telling you
the truth.

11:53.779 --> 11:56.515
That I want
to make love to you.

11:56.582 --> 11:58.084
But you keep putting it off.

11:58.150 --> 12:00.152
Well, I wanted it
to be special.

12:01.721 --> 12:04.223
You and me,
It's already special.

12:04.290 --> 12:06.025
You'll see.

12:07.693 --> 12:10.763
I don't think
I can trust you anymore.

12:10.830 --> 12:13.199
Gina, I'm sorry I lied to you.

12:13.265 --> 12:15.000
I didn't wanna hurt you.
Yeah.

12:19.038 --> 12:21.140
Babe, you should see how good
the Bomb Squad is doing.

12:21.207 --> 12:22.708
We actually have a shot
at Regionals.

12:22.775 --> 12:24.243
That's my girl.

12:24.510 --> 12:26.512
( speaking in Spanish )

12:27.813 --> 12:29.682
So how was your day?

12:29.749 --> 12:31.650
Honestly,
it couldn't be better.

12:31.717 --> 12:33.853
I sold three cars
to one family.

12:33.919 --> 12:35.287
Seriously,
those Persians are loaded.

12:35.554 --> 12:36.956
( Isela crying )

12:37.022 --> 12:39.592
Hold on, let me check on Isela.
All right.

12:46.565 --> 12:48.534
( dramatic theme playing )

12:51.837 --> 12:53.672
CECI:
God, she finally
went to sleep,

12:53.739 --> 12:56.876
so tell me
about this big sale.

12:56.942 --> 12:58.944
( dramatic theme playing )

13:02.047 --> 13:03.549
So you don't want
to have my baby?

13:06.752 --> 13:08.954
What, I'm not
good enough for you?

13:09.021 --> 13:10.890
Pedro, of course you are.

13:10.956 --> 13:12.691
You sold three cars.

13:12.758 --> 13:15.528
I'm sure as hell better
than that punk ass pretty boy

13:15.594 --> 13:17.196
that you spread your legs for.
Stop it!

13:17.263 --> 13:19.231
I love you. I'm just
not ready for another--

13:19.298 --> 13:21.834
Then when are you gonna be
ready? All you do is lie.

13:21.901 --> 13:23.135
I pay the bills.

13:23.202 --> 13:24.770
I take care of
your little shit in there.

13:24.837 --> 13:26.572
Shut your mouth!

13:28.240 --> 13:30.976
Unh! Stupid bitch!
Nobody hits me.

13:31.043 --> 13:33.913
You understand me?
You understand? Hey, hey, hey!

13:33.979 --> 13:36.215
Do you understand?
Aah!

13:36.282 --> 13:37.883
( grunting )

13:37.950 --> 13:39.084
( Isela crying )

13:39.151 --> 13:41.687
( Ceci yelling )

13:41.754 --> 13:44.924
PEDRO:
Are you listening?
Nobody hits me! Shut up!

13:49.228 --> 13:51.197
( school bell rings )

13:51.263 --> 13:53.966
Bye, guys.

13:54.033 --> 13:56.001
Thanks for coming
to address the student body

13:56.068 --> 13:58.137
about Amber's disappearance.

13:58.204 --> 14:00.206
I wish I had better news.

14:00.272 --> 14:02.141
Well, I'm sure you're doing
the best that you can.

14:02.208 --> 14:05.044
Not finding her for a month
is doing the best you can?

14:05.110 --> 14:07.880
I can assure you, we are
following up on all leads.

14:07.947 --> 14:09.515
Yeah, right.
Excuse me?

14:09.582 --> 14:12.284
Uh, thank you,
Detective Santos, for coming.

14:12.551 --> 14:14.653
Thank you.

14:19.792 --> 14:21.794
( phone ringing )

14:25.631 --> 14:27.600
Hello?
CECI: Hi, Ms. Alvarez?

14:27.666 --> 14:29.869
Ceci?
I'm not feeling very well.

14:29.935 --> 14:31.770
MS. ALVAREZ:
 Well, what's wrong?

14:31.837 --> 14:35.140
I think I might have the flu.
I--I can't make it today.

14:35.207 --> 14:37.109
That's really bad timing.

14:37.176 --> 14:39.645
I'm so sorry.
Okay, just get better.

14:39.712 --> 14:41.013
Bye-bye.

14:41.080 --> 14:43.782
( phone rings )
Thank you for calling

14:43.849 --> 14:46.552
the National Domestic Violence
hotline. My name is Karen.

14:46.619 --> 14:48.787
Before we begin,
I want to let you know

14:48.854 --> 14:51.190
that this call is anonymous
 and confidential.

14:51.257 --> 14:53.292
How may I help you?

14:53.559 --> 14:55.895
I need a place to stay.
 Okay.

14:55.961 --> 14:57.129
Are you safe right now?

14:57.196 --> 14:59.665
I'm alone right now.
He's at work.

14:59.732 --> 15:01.500
Are there
any children involved?

15:01.567 --> 15:03.669
( sobbing )

15:03.736 --> 15:05.538
I have a daughter.
She's two.

15:05.604 --> 15:08.607
I'm gonna search
for local agencies in your area.

15:08.674 --> 15:11.010
What city and state
are you calling from?

15:11.076 --> 15:12.745
From East L.A., California.

15:12.811 --> 15:14.980
I'm gonna connect you
to a local agency.

15:15.047 --> 15:17.049
Please don't hang up.
 Okay.

15:23.622 --> 15:24.823
TIFFANY:
I need to find a chicken.

15:24.890 --> 15:26.926
A chicken?

15:26.992 --> 15:30.162
Who are you
gonna put a spell on?

15:30.229 --> 15:32.197
Come on, girl,
you can tell me.

15:32.264 --> 15:34.567
I'm not gonna judge.

15:34.633 --> 15:37.236
It's Diego.
Diego?

15:39.572 --> 15:43.642
Wait.
Gina's Diego?

15:43.709 --> 15:45.277
( dramatic theme playing )

15:45.544 --> 15:46.979
Our girl's boyfriend?

15:50.849 --> 15:52.518
What the hell
is wrong with you?

15:52.585 --> 15:56.755
Where's your self respect?
You don't understand.

15:56.822 --> 15:58.624
We're soul mates.

15:58.691 --> 16:02.595
If we weren't so close to
regionals, I would tell Gina.

16:02.661 --> 16:06.031

I'd kick your ass.

No. I just need a safe place

for me and Isela to stay
for a couple of days.

20:41.607 --> 20:43.041
We can create
a safety plan.

20:43.108 --> 20:45.711
Do you have any friends
or family you can stay with?

20:47.880 --> 20:50.649
No, I got no one.

20:50.716 --> 20:53.552
Then you can go to a shelter,
but you have to cut off

20:53.619 --> 20:56.121
all contact with your boyfriend
for at least thirty days.

20:56.188 --> 20:57.956

She's at day care.

come back here immediately,

Okay.
