00:01.347 --> 00:03.150
In the criminal justice system,

00:03.150 --> 00:06.819
sexually-based offenses
are considered especially heinous

00:06.819 --> 00:08.077
In New York City,

00:08.077 --> 00:11.744
the dedicated detectives who investigate
these vicious felonies are members

00:11.744 --> 00:14.646
of an elite squad known
as The Special Victims Unit.

00:14.646 --> 00:16.670
These are their stories.

00:20.062 --> 00:22.918
Subject 22512-M.

00:22.918 --> 00:24.895
Hemolysis at the time of death.

00:24.895 --> 00:27.316
Lawrence, you make a case
for pink teeth,

00:27.316 --> 00:28.666
you're asking for trouble.

00:28.666 --> 00:31.508
As my students say,
"Bring it on."

00:31.508 --> 00:34.105
Subject 22512-F.

00:34.105 --> 00:36.663
Tissue breakdown
consistent with exposure.

00:36.663 --> 00:38.477
Scavengers aren't eating, though.

00:38.477 --> 00:41.613
What do you expect?
The place is a smorgasbord.

00:44.987 --> 00:46.966
Who put them on the trail?

00:51.514 --> 00:55.750
- These don't belong to us.
- Call the police.

01:02.407 --> 01:04.256
You're contaminating our experiments.

01:04.256 --> 01:06.115
Hey, be careful.
Sorry.

01:06.115 --> 01:08.575
- Are you the SAC?
- You from Special Victims?

01:08.575 --> 01:09.962
Detective Stabler.

01:09.962 --> 01:11.643
Special Agent in Charge,
Rod Franklin.

01:11.643 --> 01:14.868
This is Doctor Talbot.
He runs this facility.

01:15.201 --> 01:17.505
It's a hell of a place
you got here, Doc.

01:17.505 --> 01:19.128
Decay research, Detective.

01:19.128 --> 01:21.529
We study death to help
law enforcement.

01:21.529 --> 01:25.023
Rates of decomp,
cadaver-insect symbiosis,

01:25.023 --> 01:28.006
geology, cadaverine
and putrescine compounds...

01:28.006 --> 01:31.874
Doc, we'll get out of your hair a lot faster
if you'd wait in your office.

01:31.874 --> 01:32.973
Thank you.

01:36.067 --> 01:37.500
How'd they get in here?

01:37.500 --> 01:40.767
We got drag marks inside
and out of the compound.

01:40.767 --> 01:42.544
The unsub parked
on the back country road.

01:42.544 --> 01:43.750
Anyone work here at night?

01:43.750 --> 01:47.097
Strictly a day job, except
for occasional experiments in the lab.

01:47.097 --> 01:49.483
There security cameras?

01:49.483 --> 01:52.454
Only people trying to break in here
are drunken frat boys

01:52.454 --> 01:55.370
and brave Halloween pranksters.

01:55.597 --> 01:56.893
Have you been briefed on the victims?

01:56.893 --> 01:59.220
The two adult IDs were intact.

01:59.220 --> 02:02.327
The Hispanic female
was one of our unit's rape victims.

02:02.327 --> 02:04.601
Detective Benson was the primary.

02:04.601 --> 02:06.586
The minor we're still checking on.

02:06.586 --> 02:09.392
The white male was the father
of a rape-murder victim.

02:09.392 --> 02:11.050
Also my partner's case.

02:11.050 --> 02:14.368
Since you're senior in your department,
you'll act as liaison.

02:14.368 --> 02:17.222
I'll also need you to coordinate your
primary detectives of record

02:17.222 --> 02:20.209
for a briefing at 1700 hours.

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON NBC: 2001/10/05

03:18.449 --> 03:20.698
Elliot, all three victims were my cases.

03:20.698 --> 03:22.285
Why wasn't I called to the body farm?

03:22.285 --> 03:26.081
Because I'm the Feds' VICAP partner
and there just wasn't enough time.

03:26.081 --> 03:28.426
Look, the bodies were dumped
at a federal facility,

03:28.426 --> 03:30.341
but Huang thinks that
they were killed in the city,

03:30.341 --> 03:31.598
so it's our case.

03:31.598 --> 03:33.868
No. No, it's not our case.
This is my case.

03:33.868 --> 03:36.321
I'm the lead detective on this one.

03:36.908 --> 03:38.369
Okay.

03:40.147 --> 03:42.058
Let's get started.

03:42.727 --> 03:45.634
These are our three victims.

03:45.634 --> 03:47.823
Our first victim was Peter Cordell.

03:47.823 --> 03:50.734
I met Peter in 1993 when his daughter,

03:50.734 --> 03:53.393
Tina Cordell, was raped and murdered.

03:53.393 --> 03:56.636
I kept him updated on the case,
I drove him to court every day

03:56.636 --> 04:01.391
and I held his hand when our perp,
Victor Klaussen, was acquitted.

04:01.391 --> 04:02.777
What went wrong with the case?

04:02.777 --> 04:05.728
A series of lab mix-ups
contaminated the evidence.

04:05.728 --> 04:08.506
Pioneer days of DNA. There was
nothing you could do about it.

04:08.506 --> 04:10.886
What's the background
on the Hispanic female?

04:10.886 --> 04:13.961
Victim Number 2
is Carmela Barrantes.

04:13.961 --> 04:16.868
She was raped and beaten
three years ago by a gang-banger

04:16.868 --> 04:18.933
who's now serving 8-to-12
in Sing Sing.

04:18.933 --> 04:21.089
I guess we can cross him off
our suspect list.

04:21.089 --> 04:24.116
Why? This might be a revenge killing
by the gang-banger's crew.

04:24.116 --> 04:26.827
But there's no gang affiliation between
the other two victims.

04:26.827 --> 04:29.116
Are we sure about that?
What about the 10-year-old?

04:29.116 --> 04:31.495
Gangs are recruiting younger
and younger these days.

04:31.495 --> 04:33.760
Victim Number 3
is Clayton Derricks,

04:33.760 --> 04:36.989
who was physically abused
by his father, Bruce Derricks.

04:36.989 --> 04:39.206
When Clayton was placed
in a group home,

04:39.206 --> 04:42.644
he was sodomized by an older boy
and then he was placed in foster care,

04:42.644 --> 04:45.885
and I cannot tell you what it took
to get this boy to trust me.

04:45.885 --> 04:48.792
A missing persons report was filed
yesterday by the foster mother.

04:48.792 --> 04:50.378
Do we know cause of death?

04:50.378 --> 04:52.319
Preliminary tox reports just came in.

04:52.319 --> 04:55.369
All three victims were pumped full of
sedatives and potassium chloride.

04:55.369 --> 04:57.027
ME says death was painless.

04:57.027 --> 04:59.530
Like that makes a difference.

04:59.748 --> 05:01.716
Interview the families.

05:01.716 --> 05:04.867
Let's find a connection
other than Benson.

05:07.055 --> 05:09.936
Home of Adam Cordell
424 West 38th Street
Tuesday, February 27

05:09.936 --> 05:13.372
By any chance, did your father know
a Carmela Barrantes

05:13.372 --> 05:17.257
or a young boy
named Clayton Derricks?

05:17.257 --> 05:20.999
Dad met a lot of people
while he kept Klaussen in his sights,

05:20.999 --> 05:23.798
but he never mentioned them to me.

05:24.015 --> 05:27.280
When Tina died, I didn't think
it could get any worse.

05:27.280 --> 05:29.753
Watching her killer in the courtroom,

05:29.753 --> 05:32.849
seeing him smile when
they declared him not guilty.

05:32.849 --> 05:36.182
Mr. Cordell,
the lab made mistakes.

05:36.182 --> 05:39.328
That bastard's walking free.
He killed my sister.

05:39.328 --> 05:42.778
He probably killed my dad.
He's just gonna get away with that, too?

05:42.778 --> 05:44.515
Have you seen
Victor Klaussen in the area?

05:44.515 --> 05:45.518
Has he threatened you?

05:45.518 --> 05:48.308
You know what that murdering scum
is doing right now?

05:48.308 --> 05:49.995
He's laying carpet in Queens.

05:49.995 --> 05:51.967
Yeah, his brother-in-law
got him the job.

05:51.967 --> 05:55.224
He's married now.
His wife is pregnant.

05:55.224 --> 05:56.705
Have you been stalking him?

05:56.705 --> 05:58.887
No, my father used to follow him.

05:58.887 --> 06:00.463
Always wanted to know
where he was

06:00.463 --> 06:04.174
so he could tell everybody
what he was.

06:04.550 --> 06:06.918
And that got him killed.

06:08.121 --> 06:10.330
Hey, Victor. How you doing?

06:10.645 --> 06:12.204
I'm working.

06:12.204 --> 06:14.701
Well, you need to account for your
movements for the last couple of days.

06:14.701 --> 06:15.758
I don't have to talk to you.

06:15.758 --> 06:17.693
A jury found me not guilty, remember?

06:17.693 --> 06:18.832
Okay. We'll talk to his wife.

06:18.832 --> 06:20.083
I'm sure she'll tell us
what we need to know.

06:20.083 --> 06:21.756
Why can't you just leave me alone?

06:21.756 --> 06:23.519
Like you left Tina Cordell alone?

06:23.519 --> 06:25.154
You raped her,
then you strangled her.

06:25.154 --> 06:27.899
You know, you can't harass me.
Not you and not her old man.

06:27.899 --> 06:29.929
- Her old man is dead, Victor.
- Good.

06:29.929 --> 06:31.931
I can get on with my life now.
Why don't you?

06:31.931 --> 06:33.355
Oh, we'd like to,
except he was murdered.

06:33.355 --> 06:35.240
That makes you
prime suspect number one.

06:35.240 --> 06:37.013
You know, you can't
pin that on me, all right?

06:37.013 --> 06:39.312
The guy was unhinged.
I even had to get a restraining order,

06:39.312 --> 06:40.774
but you cops,
you never enforced it.

06:40.774 --> 06:43.709
Well, that's 'cause we figured a murdering
rapist like you can handle yourself.

06:43.709 --> 06:45.480
You know, Tina had
a smart mouth, too.

06:45.480 --> 06:47.047
It got her in a lot of trouble.

06:47.047 --> 06:48.580
- That sounded like a threat.
- Yeah, it did.

06:48.580 --> 06:50.133
Maybe we should arrest him.
Ruin his day.

06:50.133 --> 06:51.761
Arrest me for what?

06:52.191 --> 06:53.743
How about an obstruction, resisting?

06:53.743 --> 06:55.451
It's a long way to the station house.

06:55.451 --> 06:57.193
I'll think of a thousand reasons
by the time we get there.

06:57.193 --> 06:58.559
We'll let you stew
in the can for a few days,

06:58.559 --> 07:00.670
maybe even leak
that you're a pedophile.

07:00.670 --> 07:03.722
I bet after your arraignment,
you'll tell us anything we want to know.

07:03.722 --> 07:05.481
Okay. Two nights ago, 
I was home.

07:05.481 --> 07:08.014
Last night my wife and I
were at Lamaze class.

07:08.014 --> 07:10.017
She has the number.

07:10.457 --> 07:11.709
We're done.

07:12.817 --> 07:14.360
Now we're done.

07:18.229 --> 07:20.660
Mrs. Harding's Foster Home
450 East 106th Street
Tuesday, February 27

07:20.660 --> 07:24.785
At any given time,
I've got six kids living here.

07:24.785 --> 07:28.628
It's temporary until they can
be placed in a home.

07:28.628 --> 07:32.317
Clayton was with me three months,
but he never warmed to me.

07:32.317 --> 07:34.862
I guess he didn't
want to get attached.

07:34.862 --> 07:36.630
He run away a lot?

07:36.630 --> 07:39.098
It's not unusual.

07:39.298 --> 07:41.589
Clayton was pretty stable considering.

07:41.589 --> 07:44.420
The younger kids looked up to him.

07:45.303 --> 07:46.578
Did he run home to his father?

07:46.578 --> 07:49.275
No. He hasn't
seen his dad in a while.

07:49.275 --> 07:51.343
Visits were always supervised.

07:51.343 --> 07:53.564
Usually by Detective Benson.

07:53.564 --> 07:57.200
When he did run, we could
always find Clayton in the Bronx.

07:57.200 --> 07:58.676
That was his old stomping ground?

07:58.676 --> 08:00.828
That's where the group home is.

08:00.828 --> 08:03.071
He has a close friend
who still lives there.

08:03.071 --> 08:05.847
I contacted them
before I called the police,

08:05.847 --> 08:07.861
but the boy said he hadn't seen him.

08:07.861 --> 08:09.354
What's his name?

08:09.354 --> 08:11.208
Michael Washington.

08:11.441 --> 08:14.357
Michael and Clayton first bonded
over abusive fathers.

08:14.357 --> 08:16.448
Then Michael tried to fight
Clayton's attacker

08:16.448 --> 08:18.254
and got his arm broken
for his troubles.

08:18.254 --> 08:20.049
After that they were inseparable.

08:20.049 --> 08:21.280
What happened to the rapist?

08:21.280 --> 08:23.842
He's now housed in the city's
finest juvenile facility,

08:23.842 --> 08:26.011
where I'm sure he's honing
his criminal skills.

08:26.011 --> 08:28.173
Some reason why you didn't
keep Clayton here with his friend?

08:28.173 --> 08:30.387
His counselor thought it was
best to move him to foster care

08:30.387 --> 08:33.433
and I disagreed,
but I don't have a Ph.D.

08:33.433 --> 08:36.173
Clayton's foster mother said she
called here after his disappearance.

08:36.173 --> 08:37.354
Yeah. I questioned the boy.

08:37.354 --> 08:39.541
He assured me he hadn't
seen Clayton in a while.

08:39.541 --> 08:40.832
- You believe him?
- No.

08:40.832 --> 08:44.207
He probably thought his friend
was in trouble, so he covered for him.

08:46.150 --> 08:49.641
Michael, how you doing?

08:49.641 --> 08:52.020
These detectives need
to talk to you about Clayton

08:52.020 --> 08:54.678
and they would appreciate
your honesty.

08:54.678 --> 08:57.049
You need me to stay?

08:58.314 --> 09:01.625
No. / All right.
I'll be right outside.

09:01.625 --> 09:03.840
Badges?

09:07.901 --> 09:09.462
What do you want to know?

09:09.462 --> 09:11.657
Did you see Clayton yesterday?

09:11.657 --> 09:12.719
Yeah.

09:12.719 --> 09:14.939
- Where'd you meet him?
- Down the block.

09:14.939 --> 09:16.213
He was all excited.

09:16.213 --> 09:18.245
Got some letter saying
he won a computer.

09:18.245 --> 09:21.148
Knew it was a scam.
Nobody gets something for nothing.

09:21.148 --> 09:22.819
You know where he went
to pick it up?

09:22.819 --> 09:25.196
No. You had to bring
the letter with you.

09:25.196 --> 09:26.596
Begged me for cab money.

09:26.596 --> 09:29.158
Said if he got on the subway,
he'd get jacked.

09:29.158 --> 09:30.460
How much money did you give him?

09:30.460 --> 09:33.163
All I had. $22.15.

09:33.163 --> 09:34.652
Where'd Clayton catch the cab?

09:34.652 --> 09:37.012
We called one from
the McDonald's parking lot.

09:37.012 --> 09:38.700
You remember the name
of the cab company?

09:38.700 --> 09:42.571
Got it from the book.
Starling Car Service.

09:43.177 --> 09:44.632
Thanks.

09:45.297 --> 09:47.745
Barrantes Residence
800 Amsterdam Avenue
Tuesday, February 27

09:47.745 --> 09:50.449
She didn't go out alone after the rape.

09:50.449 --> 09:53.199
She lost touch with her friends.

09:53.199 --> 09:54.384
Any boyfriends?

09:54.384 --> 09:56.919
The last one was abusive.

09:56.919 --> 10:00.717
Carmela finally got rid of him
after going to a counselor.

10:00.717 --> 10:05.027
She was getting stronger,
going back to school.

10:05.027 --> 10:08.099
She even won a computer.

10:08.904 --> 10:13.751
Won a computer, like through
a contest or a raffle?

10:13.941 --> 10:16.596
No. I saw the letter.

10:16.596 --> 10:20.208
It looked like
one of those sales deals.

10:20.208 --> 10:22.446
- Is it important?
- Well, it might be.

10:22.446 --> 10:24.511
Do you still have that letter?

10:24.511 --> 10:26.601
She took it with her.

10:26.601 --> 10:30.590
- I'm sorry I can't help you more.
- It's okay.

10:30.590 --> 10:33.680
We're gonna find out who did this.

10:35.514 --> 10:41.144
I want to thank you for helping
my daughter, Detective Benson.

10:41.144 --> 10:45.163
I will always be grateful for that.

10:47.492 --> 10:50.157
Hey, Cap, so far it doesn't
look like the victims knew each other.

10:50.157 --> 10:52.589
Well, what about the boy's father?
Have we located him yet?

10:52.589 --> 10:54.963
Moved from his last known address.
We're still looking.

10:54.963 --> 10:56.348
We checked with the Cordells.

10:56.348 --> 10:59.309
Turns out the father got a letter
saying he won a desktop computer,

10:59.309 --> 11:01.017
just like the kid.

11:01.017 --> 11:03.135
Mrs. Barrantes said that
Carmela got the same letter.

11:03.135 --> 11:04.771
Three for three,

11:04.771 --> 11:07.589
but no letters were found
at the scene or on the bodies.

11:07.589 --> 11:09.589
Got a hit from Starling Car Service.

11:09.589 --> 11:12.014
Dispatch states that a kid matching
Clayton's description

11:12.014 --> 11:14.638
was dropped off
at this address in Chelsea.

11:14.638 --> 11:15.963
We're gonna need
a search warrant.

11:15.963 --> 11:18.220
I'll take care of it.
Get moving.

11:18.892 --> 11:20.986
I never met the guy.
We did everything over the phone.

11:20.986 --> 11:22.101
What was the name on the lease?

11:22.101 --> 11:23.590
Vilia Sonoben.
From out of town.

11:23.590 --> 11:25.637
He was looking for space
to set up shop here.

11:25.637 --> 11:28.446
He had a local bank account.
He paid six months in advance.

11:28.446 --> 11:29.937
And how'd he get the key?

11:29.937 --> 11:32.213
He phoned ahead, told me to leave
the key above the door.

11:32.213 --> 11:35.303
The place was empty.
There was nothing to steal.

11:36.322 --> 11:38.848
Your tenant give you any idea
what he did for a living?

11:38.848 --> 11:40.595
He designs promotional literature.

11:40.595 --> 11:43.039
You know, those little brochures
you get in the mail.

11:43.039 --> 11:44.955
You got a phone number
in case of emergency?

11:44.955 --> 11:47.569
After you phoned, I tried to reach him,
but the number's disconnected.

11:47.569 --> 11:50.143
What's this guy done?

11:51.721 --> 11:56.784
"Congratulations, you are the lucky winner
of a new Sonic Vox desktop computer."

11:56.784 --> 12:00.969
Well, they all had to bring the letters
and sit down with our suspect.

12:00.969 --> 12:03.469
Have a drink, it's laced with,
I don't know, Valium

12:03.469 --> 12:04.855
and then it's lights out.

12:04.855 --> 12:06.264
We've got our crime scene.

12:06.264 --> 12:08.623
Crime scene? In my building?

12:08.623 --> 12:11.585
I am not responsible for what
my tenants do in their offices.

12:11.585 --> 12:14.925
I mean, how do I know what kind of
people I'm renting space to?

12:14.925 --> 12:16.833
Guys.

12:26.512 --> 12:28.340
Three victims,

12:28.340 --> 12:33.432
different race, different gender,
different age.

12:33.432 --> 12:37.921
This is about revenge.
The real target is Detective Benson.

12:37.921 --> 12:39.176
It's personal.

12:39.176 --> 12:42.026
You've enraged someone so much
they want you twisting.

12:42.026 --> 12:43.767
Why the body farm?

12:43.767 --> 12:47.267
Why transport three victims
90 miles outside the city?

12:47.267 --> 12:48.923
He wanted them found and studied.

12:48.923 --> 12:51.429
He dumped them at a research facility
that's federally funded.

12:51.429 --> 12:53.314
Guaranteeing national attention.

12:53.314 --> 12:55.532
But how did the suspect find them?

12:55.532 --> 12:56.840
How did he get into my files?

12:56.840 --> 12:58.890
How did he even know
that they're my case?

12:58.890 --> 13:02.062
Tina Cordell case had a lot of national
press coverage, right?

13:02.062 --> 13:03.455
High-school kid raped,

13:03.455 --> 13:06.222
strangled with her purse strap
by her boyfriend, Victor Klaussen.

13:06.222 --> 13:09.036
Latching onto a news story doesn't
explain the other two victims though.

13:09.036 --> 13:10.735
The foster mother said
that you supervised meetings

13:10.735 --> 13:13.208
between Clayton and his father.
Why?

13:13.208 --> 13:15.164
Because the man is a drunk.

13:15.164 --> 13:17.099
I thought if I stuck around
that he'd get some help.

13:17.099 --> 13:18.090
I know what it's like
to live through that.

13:18.090 --> 13:20.829
You maintained a personal relationship
with Carmela Barrantes.

13:20.829 --> 13:22.034
Well, she needed help.

13:22.034 --> 13:24.486
My day doesn't end when we catch
a perp or get a conviction.

13:24.486 --> 13:25.856
No one's blaming you, Detective.

13:25.856 --> 13:28.181
Well, you think that
I led him to these people,

13:28.181 --> 13:29.654
that I have a stalker?

13:29.654 --> 13:31.885
If that's how he chose them,
he wasn't stalking you.

13:31.885 --> 13:34.904
There was no sexual fixation.
It was reconnaissance.

13:34.904 --> 13:37.298
Well, let's look into my files
and see who has a grudge.

13:37.298 --> 13:40.679
Potassium chloride is an ingredient
in a death-row cocktail.

13:40.679 --> 13:43.564
Sounds to me like ex-con contempt.

13:43.564 --> 13:47.205
Using police restraints to pose the bodies
is a significant indicator.

13:47.205 --> 13:49.781
Check the computer
for recent prison releases.

13:49.781 --> 13:52.913
We're looking for an ex-con
who has a serious hatred for Olivia.

13:52.913 --> 13:55.320
Let's start with the ones
who were vocal about it.

13:55.320 --> 13:58.656
First, you two,
follow the money.

14:00.087 --> 14:02.660
Here it is. The account was opened
four months ago.

14:02.660 --> 14:04.678
Hasn't been any activity in 30 days.

14:04.678 --> 14:06.197
We'd like you to put
a freeze on the account.

14:06.197 --> 14:07.931
I'm going to need something
with a judge's signature.

14:07.931 --> 14:08.732
That's en route,

14:08.732 --> 14:10.848
but in the meantime we'd like you
to pull all the canceled checks

14:10.848 --> 14:13.357
- so we can test for fingerprints.
- All we have are photocopies.

14:13.357 --> 14:15.300
We return the originals
to the account holder.

14:15.300 --> 14:17.199
You got a balance here?

14:17.199 --> 14:19.279
$1,300 and change.

14:19.279 --> 14:21.626
All right.
If there's any activity,

14:21.626 --> 14:23.769
I want you to hold the check.

14:23.769 --> 14:26.501
Call the FBI task force
and they'll process everything, okay?

14:26.501 --> 14:29.745
I'll add an addendum to the file
that the check shouldn't be handled.

14:29.745 --> 14:31.603
- Thank you.
- Sure.

14:33.394 --> 14:35.065
Those checks should go to our lab.

14:35.065 --> 14:37.092
I don't want the Feds
processing our evidence,

14:37.092 --> 14:39.269
doling out information
whenever they feel like it.

14:39.269 --> 14:41.389
Well, their lab is
better equipped, it's faster.

14:41.389 --> 14:42.812
If there are any problems
then it's on them.

14:42.812 --> 14:44.436
Wasn't your name stenciled
on that door,

14:44.436 --> 14:46.107
so whose ass are you really covering?

14:46.107 --> 14:47.361
Okay. The way I see it,

14:47.361 --> 14:49.507
the only us and them
is cops and criminals.

14:49.507 --> 14:50.941
- We are on the same team.
- Yeah.

14:50.941 --> 14:53.870
We are till the press shows up.
Benson.

14:54.687 --> 14:56.601
We're on our way.

14:56.601 --> 14:57.764
Got Clayton's father.

14:57.764 --> 15:00.464
He's in the Tombs
on a drunk and disorderly.

15:01.086 --> 15:03.054
Clayton is dead, Mr. Derricks.

15:03.054 --> 15:05.144
No, he can't be.

15:05.144 --> 15:10.120
Well, someone killed your son and
dumped his body outside of Poughkeepsie.

15:11.944 --> 15:13.651
What's my boy doing way out there?

15:13.651 --> 15:16.120
When was the last time
you had contact with Clayton?

15:16.120 --> 15:19.214
They wouldn't let me talk to him.
Said I couldn't see him.

15:19.214 --> 15:21.384
It was your fault.
You said I wasn't a good father.

15:21.384 --> 15:23.970
Has anybody tried to talk
to you about your son?

15:23.970 --> 15:26.714
Anyone at all?
Strangers, social workers?

15:26.714 --> 15:28.510
He told you I didn't hit him.

15:28.510 --> 15:30.542
He told you that
he fell off his bike.

15:30.542 --> 15:34.200
Clayton didn't have a bike, Mr. Derricks.
He barely had enough to eat.

15:34.200 --> 15:36.133
Oh, I remember.

15:36.718 --> 15:38.070
What do you remember?

15:38.070 --> 15:41.200
Clayton was raped
in that group home.

15:41.200 --> 15:43.617
You took him from me.

15:45.356 --> 15:48.236
Said he'd be better off.

15:49.230 --> 15:50.955
Guard!

15:52.128 --> 15:54.045
- I'm fine.
- I'm not.

15:54.439 --> 15:56.243
Some low-life's out to get you.

15:56.243 --> 15:58.223
If he wanted to take me out,
he would've tried it already.

15:58.223 --> 16:00.576
So now you can read minds and you
got eyes in the back of your head.

16:00.576 --> 16:02.138
Stabler.

16:02.138 --> 16:03.545
Yeah.

16:04.943 --> 16:06.446
How many?

16:08.575 --> 16:11.147
That's not a problem.
We'll just split it up.

16:11.891 --> 16:13.515
Yeah.

16:14.475 --> 16:15.886
Got it.

16:15.886 --> 16:18.410
Three ex-cons you sent up
were loud about getting even.

16:18.410 --> 16:22.238
Cragen thinks all three might have
the resources to pull this off.

16:22.850 --> 16:26.418
West 125th Street & Broadway
Wednesday, February 28

16:27.113 --> 16:30.441
Oh, I remember Detective Benson.
How are you?

16:30.441 --> 16:32.639
I'm curious about some of
your activities, Junior.

16:32.639 --> 16:35.303
Sorry. Gave up my life
of crime long ago.

16:35.303 --> 16:36.473
What's your beef?

16:36.473 --> 16:38.449
Well, you were pretty vocal
about getting even

16:38.449 --> 16:40.751
when I collared you
for car-jacking and rape.

16:40.751 --> 16:42.105
I was hopped up on crack.

16:42.105 --> 16:45.140
I don't blame you for anything, Detective.
At least, not anymore.

16:45.140 --> 16:48.566
You used to run these streets.
Your crew still run drugs up to Canada?

16:48.566 --> 16:50.703
All my friends are 
either dead or in jail,

16:50.703 --> 16:52.488
so why the trip down memory lane?

16:52.488 --> 16:53.890
Because we're out of time.

16:53.890 --> 16:55.492
We need some answers, Junior.

16:55.492 --> 16:57.878
Someone's got my partner
in their sights.

16:57.878 --> 17:00.521
They must not be very good
since she's still breathing.

17:00.521 --> 17:02.170
You were never very subtle,
were you?

17:02.170 --> 17:04.955
Saved the finesse for business,
not petty beefs.

17:04.955 --> 17:07.647
And like I said, I'm over that.

17:07.647 --> 17:11.825
So you just sit in that chair
and watch the world go by. That it?

17:11.825 --> 17:13.909
I spend my days
on these streets with the kids.

17:13.909 --> 17:15.902
Hope they'll see this chair
and wake up.

17:15.902 --> 17:17.338
That's what my life's about.

17:17.338 --> 17:19.583
Give us some names
and we're done.

17:19.583 --> 17:21.974
Uniforms will vouch
for my work with gangs.

17:21.974 --> 17:26.505
Reverend Johnson at Faithful Central
will give you a list of my caretakers.

17:28.257 --> 17:31.143
Hope you find your man.

17:33.845 --> 17:36.037
- I didn't do it.
- Do what?

17:36.037 --> 17:38.728
I've just been sitting here
making a living, all right?

17:38.728 --> 17:40.504
I wasn't there.
I didn't do it.

17:40.504 --> 17:43.255
You remember Detective Benson?

17:43.255 --> 17:45.194
Bitch was at my parole hearing.

17:45.194 --> 17:46.755
Is she dead?

17:48.865 --> 17:51.493
I let them take away my manhood

17:51.493 --> 17:54.570
so I can get out and she shows up
and throws a monkey wrench.

17:54.570 --> 17:55.529
That wasn't right.

17:55.529 --> 17:57.951
Wasn't right raping
your six-year-old niece.

17:57.951 --> 17:59.610
Getting out early,
definitely wasn't right.

17:59.610 --> 18:01.395
I take the shots.

18:01.395 --> 18:04.336
You know, they make me fat and sick.

18:04.336 --> 18:07.387
Look at me.
I got my own rack now.

18:07.387 --> 18:08.930
You think I like looking like this?

18:08.930 --> 18:11.735
Ponytails and barrettes
still get you hot, fat boy?

18:11.735 --> 18:14.282
No. Sir.

18:14.520 --> 18:16.055
Haven't been anywhere near a kid.

18:16.055 --> 18:18.724
That's a stupid lie!
They can come here to you!

18:18.724 --> 18:20.799
I got no more sex drive.

18:20.799 --> 18:22.607
Look, I'm clean. I swear.

18:22.607 --> 18:25.346
What's it gonna take
for you guys to believe me?

18:25.346 --> 18:27.805
A special kind of surgery.

18:32.398 --> 18:35.388
Heaven Scent Flowers
490 Broome Street
Wednesday, February 28

18:35.388 --> 18:37.494
What the hell do you want?

18:37.494 --> 18:39.842
- We'd like to talk to your husband.
- We're divorced.

18:39.842 --> 18:42.380
- You keep in contact?
- You've got to be kidding me.

18:42.380 --> 18:45.358
Mrs. Plummer,
somebody's killing people.

18:45.358 --> 18:47.720
Somebody with a grudge
against me.

18:47.720 --> 18:51.942
Now, under the circumstances,
your ex-husband qualifies.

18:51.942 --> 18:54.171
You put an innocent man in prison.

18:54.171 --> 18:56.765
He served seven years
for attempted murder and rape.

18:56.765 --> 18:58.682
Crimes he didn't commit.

18:58.682 --> 18:59.982
Leave Eric alone.

18:59.982 --> 19:02.247
Eyewitness testimony 
put him in prison.

19:02.247 --> 19:04.328
Now we know DNA evidence
cleared him.

19:04.328 --> 19:06.544
It just wasn't
available at the time.

19:06.544 --> 19:09.216
And that makes everything all right?

19:09.216 --> 19:10.864
Do you know where he is?

19:10.864 --> 19:12.642
Mrs. Plummer, we can
charge you with obstruction

19:12.642 --> 19:14.051
and we don't want to do that.

19:14.051 --> 19:17.600
I don't know where he is.
But if I did, I still wouldn't tell you.

19:24.563 --> 19:25.515
We'll dump her phones.

19:25.515 --> 19:28.099
She might give her ex a heads-up
that we're looking.

19:28.099 --> 19:30.335
Tomorrow? I'm tired.

19:30.335 --> 19:32.260
Feel like some dinner?

19:32.591 --> 19:34.412
When was the last time
your kids saw your ugly mug?

19:34.412 --> 19:35.896
Oh, we'll set an extra place.
Come on.

19:35.896 --> 19:37.514
No. No thanks.

19:37.514 --> 19:39.864
I'll see you later, okay?

20:21.548 --> 20:23.104
Who is it?

20:26.091 --> 20:28.218
Who's down there?

20:31.360 --> 20:33.862
You've got the wrong apartment.

21:51.052 --> 21:52.967
Hotshot like the others?

21:52.967 --> 21:55.509
Bastard dumped him
at my feet, like some gift.

21:55.509 --> 21:57.717
Clayton Derricks' father.

21:57.905 --> 21:59.913
The canvass of your neighbors
is drawing a blank.

21:59.913 --> 22:02.288
Did you notice any strangers
in the area, Detective Benson?

22:02.288 --> 22:03.927
Anyone who stood out?

22:03.927 --> 22:06.089
Is there some reason
that you think that if I had

22:06.089 --> 22:08.104
that I would withhold
the information?

22:08.104 --> 22:10.976
Sorry, but as much training
as we get in being observant,

22:10.976 --> 22:13.955
when it comes to our personal
safety and well-being,

22:13.955 --> 22:15.049
we're not as diligent.

22:15.049 --> 22:16.582
My partner knows how to do her job.

22:16.582 --> 22:19.141
Look, I'm sure Detective
Benson is capable,

22:19.141 --> 22:21.554
but she's going to have to stand down.

22:21.554 --> 22:23.263
No.

22:23.564 --> 22:26.133
This man was alive until you went
to the Tombs and questioned him.

22:26.133 --> 22:27.898
A little early to be
pointing fingers, isn't it?

22:27.898 --> 22:30.381
I'm not trying to blame her,
but she can't work this case anymore.

22:30.381 --> 22:32.490
Look, you're wasting your breath.
First of all, I don't work for you.

22:32.490 --> 22:34.553
Second of all,
these victims are my cases.

22:34.553 --> 22:36.413
The perp is stalking you,

22:36.413 --> 22:38.031
which is why you need
a protective detail.

22:38.031 --> 22:39.568
No, forget about it.
I'm not a victim.

22:39.568 --> 22:41.074
Olivia, might not be a bad idea.

22:41.074 --> 22:42.695
We're wasting time here.

22:42.695 --> 22:45.818
Does anybody know how Derricks
got bailed out of the Tombs?

22:45.818 --> 22:49.538
According to the release form,
it was you.

22:51.620 --> 22:54.157
Lonnie's Bail Bonds
50 East 116th Street
Thursday, March 1

22:54.157 --> 22:56.971
Excuse me. We need to see
the paperwork on Bruce Derricks.

22:56.971 --> 22:58.954
- Lonnie!
- What?

22:58.954 --> 23:01.339
Who put up the paperwork
on Bruce Derricks?

23:01.339 --> 23:02.995
What for? He's not a skip.

23:02.995 --> 23:04.812
The prisoner's dead.

23:09.099 --> 23:12.232
Says here a Mr. Oliver Benson
laid down a G.

23:12.232 --> 23:15.259
Sent it over to the clerk,
like I always do.

23:15.259 --> 23:16.737
Where's the ID?

23:16.737 --> 23:17.773
The guy paid cash.

23:17.773 --> 23:21.198
I don't need ID unless real property
is used for collateral.

23:21.198 --> 23:22.995
Can you give us a description?

23:22.995 --> 23:24.346
Do you know how many people
come through here

23:24.346 --> 23:25.591
looking to bail out some low-life?

23:25.591 --> 23:27.923
We want the guy
on federal and capital crimes,

23:27.923 --> 23:30.176
so I suggest
that you try to remember.

23:30.176 --> 23:31.914
I'd hate to see all the dots
connect back to you.

23:31.914 --> 23:34.388
Sweetheart, I can't help you.

23:34.388 --> 23:35.883
Sweetheart?

23:36.950 --> 23:38.709
- Everybody. Out. Now.
- Out.

23:38.709 --> 23:40.044
- Wait. What are you doing?
- Out.

23:40.044 --> 23:41.518
You can't do that!
What are you doing? Wait a minute!

23:41.518 --> 23:42.911
You're supposed to get
a copy of the ID.

23:42.911 --> 23:44.503
You're supposed to know
who's posting bail.

23:44.503 --> 23:46.290
You're supposed to keep
complete records,

23:46.290 --> 23:48.401
so the courts know
where the money's coming from.

23:48.401 --> 23:50.187
It wasn't drug money.

23:50.187 --> 23:52.261
Most people can raise a grand.

23:52.261 --> 23:53.594
Sir.

23:53.594 --> 23:54.856
- Okay?
- Okay, okay.

23:54.856 --> 23:58.333
The guy was white. Average.
I don't know, late 20s, early 30s.

23:58.333 --> 24:00.064
What can I tell you?

24:00.064 --> 24:03.830
Shirl, do you remember
hair or eye color?

24:04.567 --> 24:08.095
I'm sorry. I got nothing.

24:17.100 --> 24:20.741
Is this an official visit
or is it off the record?

24:21.088 --> 24:22.833
Both.

24:24.052 --> 24:26.915
You need to put
Detective Benson on a desk.

24:26.915 --> 24:27.949
No.

24:27.949 --> 24:30.268
- She's a liability.
- She's one of my best detectives.

24:30.268 --> 24:32.379
I don't doubt it.

24:32.920 --> 24:36.286
The bodies were dumped at a facility
funded by federal dollars.

24:36.286 --> 24:38.158
If I take the case from you,
I have to put it in writing.

24:38.158 --> 24:41.439
My complaints end up
a black mark on your file.

24:41.439 --> 24:44.220
I don't want to do that, Captain.

24:44.778 --> 24:49.479
We all have choices to make.
I've already made mine.

25:05.466 --> 25:08.611
Any hits to suggest Mrs. Plummer
called her ex-husband?

25:08.611 --> 25:10.485
Still looking.
Flowers.

25:10.485 --> 25:13.161
Seems like a big waste of money for
something that dies in a few days.

25:13.161 --> 25:15.366
No wonder you're divorced.
I send them all the time.

25:15.366 --> 25:16.847
Only 'cause you have to.

25:16.847 --> 25:17.669
I got something.

25:17.669 --> 25:23.556
It was a 45-minute call right after we left
to a Baseline Labs in Midtown.

25:23.556 --> 25:24.952
If Plummer works at the lab,

25:24.952 --> 25:27.848
that means he'd have access
to potassium chloride.

25:27.848 --> 25:29.995
And Pavulon.
ME's report came in.

25:29.995 --> 25:32.395
Unlike the other three,
Bruce Derricks suffered.

25:32.395 --> 25:35.957
Paralyzes the muscles so they can
intubate for general anesthesia.

25:35.957 --> 25:38.136
Derricks suffocated,
awake and aware.

25:38.136 --> 25:40.300
Took about two minutes to die.

25:40.300 --> 25:43.292
He saw him as a perp
and he executed him like one.

25:43.292 --> 25:44.667
Check the employees.

25:44.667 --> 25:47.297
If Mr. Plummer works there,
make sure you give him a lot of room.

25:47.297 --> 25:48.259
I don't want to jam him up.

25:48.259 --> 25:50.090
I just want to know where he's been
and what he's been doing.

25:50.090 --> 25:53.012
Just take it easy.
You're wound a little tight.

25:54.482 --> 25:56.582
You worried about something?

25:56.582 --> 25:58.298
Your safety.

25:58.298 --> 25:59.630
No protective detail.

25:59.630 --> 26:01.491
Trust me, I'm not trying to be a hero.

26:01.491 --> 26:04.604
Just that a protective detail is exactly
what this guy expects.

26:04.604 --> 26:07.496
And what happens if this hump
comes after you next?

26:07.496 --> 26:09.813
He wants me twisting,
not dead.

26:09.813 --> 26:11.101
He wants me thinking about him.

26:11.101 --> 26:13.597
- Obsessing as much as he is.
- You can't be sure of that.

26:13.597 --> 26:16.365
Yes, I can, 'cause it's working.

26:17.057 --> 26:20.205
Baseline Labs
98 West 54th Street
Thursday, March 1

26:20.205 --> 26:22.654
No, I don't have an Eric Plummer
working for us.

26:22.654 --> 26:25.325
How about this guy?
He look familiar to you?

26:25.325 --> 26:27.835
Well, this looks like Norman.

26:27.835 --> 26:30.762
- Your guy's thinner, though.
- Norman what?

26:30.762 --> 26:33.023
Webber. He works
for insurance services.

26:33.023 --> 26:35.871
He calls on our clients at their homes.

26:35.871 --> 26:38.832
He gets blood and
urine samples for physicals.

26:38.832 --> 26:39.865
This can't be the guy.

26:39.865 --> 26:41.800
We're gonna need
his personnel file.

26:41.800 --> 26:44.991
We have a rigorous screening process,
extensive background checks.

26:44.991 --> 26:47.002
Norman passed with flying colors.

26:47.002 --> 26:48.989
And where is he now?

26:50.118 --> 26:51.950
He's got the Upper
West Side today.

26:51.950 --> 26:54.876
You know, if anything happens
and we're liable for hiring an ex-con,

26:54.876 --> 26:57.437
we could lose our contracts
with the insurance companies.

26:57.437 --> 26:58.516
We could lose our bond.

26:58.516 --> 27:01.727
Mr. Platt, Norman Webber is not
an ex-con, he's not a suspect.

27:01.727 --> 27:03.001
But this photo's of...

27:03.001 --> 27:04.893
Have him call us
as soon as possible.

27:04.893 --> 27:06.256
Thank you.

27:06.525 --> 27:08.461
Yes. Yes.

27:11.384 --> 27:14.623
Hey, I was just trying to
get in our man's head.

27:14.869 --> 27:17.837
He hates me so he kills people
that I tried to help.

27:17.837 --> 27:19.873
How does that make you feel?

27:20.710 --> 27:22.152
How would you feel?

27:22.152 --> 27:23.553
Relax, I'm not trying to shrink you.

27:23.553 --> 27:26.099
Yes, you are.
Every statement's interpretive.

27:26.099 --> 27:27.527
Trying to make something out of nothing.

27:27.527 --> 27:28.517
It's my job.

27:28.517 --> 27:30.691
I used to interview some of the most
dangerous psychopaths.

27:30.691 --> 27:31.878
It's all I did.

27:31.878 --> 27:34.442
Profiling serial killers,
it sounds like a lot of fun.

27:34.442 --> 27:36.112
It's why I joined the FBI.

27:36.112 --> 27:38.857
They had access to all the disorders
that I wanted to study.

27:38.857 --> 27:41.186
Until I got complacent.

27:41.186 --> 27:43.373
Were you attacked?

27:43.373 --> 27:45.836
I was interviewing a psychopath
and I missed him calculate

27:45.836 --> 27:49.318
how much time there was to kill me
before the guards hit the door.

27:49.318 --> 27:50.868
It was a...

27:50.868 --> 27:52.353
It was a close call.

27:52.353 --> 27:53.746
He got into your head.

27:53.746 --> 27:55.475
The way this perp is in yours.

27:55.475 --> 27:57.089
Instead of attacking you directly,

27:57.089 --> 27:58.945
he's hurting the people around you.

27:58.945 --> 28:01.455
It's psychological warfare.

28:03.168 --> 28:05.080
He's been planning this for a while.

28:05.080 --> 28:07.354
He posed the bodies
comforting each other.

28:07.354 --> 28:09.645
Potassium chloride
is a painless death.

28:09.645 --> 28:11.151
He's freeing them.

28:11.151 --> 28:12.390
From what?

28:12.390 --> 28:15.889
From the miserable existence
that you left them in.

28:16.232 --> 28:20.190
He felt like they were suffering
and so he euthanized them.

28:20.190 --> 28:23.139
He identifies with them.

28:23.139 --> 28:26.991
He sees himself as your victim, too.

28:28.209 --> 28:30.578
Mr. Plummer,
thank you for coming in.

28:30.578 --> 28:32.404
Right this way.

28:34.205 --> 28:36.533
My client's been railroaded
by the police before.

28:36.533 --> 28:38.925
He's here under duress.
Is he a suspect?

28:38.925 --> 28:41.742
That's premature.
This is an ongoing investigation.

28:41.742 --> 28:44.334
As soon as we can clear him, Mr. Plummer
can put this behind him.

28:44.334 --> 28:47.460
Well, you'll understand if we insist on
Detective Benson's absence.

28:47.460 --> 28:50.240
The request is unnecessary.
I'm taking off.

28:52.043 --> 28:52.915
Let's get out of here.

28:52.915 --> 28:55.412
Chauncey's. Fin's treat.

28:58.713 --> 29:02.163
My client was wrongfully convicted
of rape and attempted murder.

29:02.163 --> 29:04.053
He spent seven years upstate.

29:04.053 --> 29:07.137
What makes you think he wants
more trouble than he's already had?

29:07.137 --> 29:10.857
Well, maybe he had plenty of time
in his cell to plan his revenge.

29:10.857 --> 29:12.086
Well, charge him and he'll answer,

29:12.086 --> 29:14.916
otherwise leave the man alone.

29:14.916 --> 29:16.704
Why not cooperate with us?

29:16.704 --> 29:18.347
Well, the last time he did,
he went to prison.

29:18.347 --> 29:20.803
Sent there by an overzealous detective.

29:20.803 --> 29:23.161
Your client did receive a fair trial.

29:23.161 --> 29:24.638
He was convicted by a jury.

29:24.638 --> 29:28.010
He wasn't personally singled out
for persecution by Detective Benson.

29:28.010 --> 29:30.329
You ever spent time in prison?

29:30.329 --> 29:31.841
Have you even been arrested?

29:31.841 --> 29:35.510
Cuffed, printed, photographed?

29:35.510 --> 29:40.027
I was beaten,
raped and tortured.

29:40.027 --> 29:44.499
I finally learned to stop screaming,
that only made it worse.

29:44.499 --> 29:49.331
Please don't dismiss what I went
through by telling me I got a fair trial.

29:49.554 --> 29:51.287
Why'd you change your name?

29:51.287 --> 29:53.277
I wanted a fresh start.

29:53.277 --> 29:56.632
I finally felt safe again
and the cops show up at my job.

29:56.632 --> 29:59.699
How long do I have to pay for a crime
that I didn't commit?

29:59.699 --> 30:01.583
What drugs do you have access to?

30:01.583 --> 30:03.902
None. I work at a lab,
not a hospital.

30:03.902 --> 30:06.927
Potassium chloride's easy to get.

30:07.366 --> 30:10.915
You could probably make it,
if you were so inclined.

30:12.007 --> 30:14.541
Even if I knew what that was,
I probably couldn't.

30:14.541 --> 30:17.336
I'm not a chemist.
Will you show it to them?

30:17.336 --> 30:21.244
This is my client's work records
for the last two weeks.

30:21.244 --> 30:25.152
He lives alone so he has
no alibi for his evenings.

30:25.152 --> 30:28.429
Only this time, don't even think
about getting a conviction

30:28.429 --> 30:32.028
based solely
on circumstantial evidence.

30:40.013 --> 30:41.479
He's absolutely right.

30:41.479 --> 30:43.718
We're gonna have to put
the syringe in his hand

30:43.718 --> 30:45.500
if we want to send him up again.

30:45.500 --> 30:47.273
I like him for this.

30:47.273 --> 30:48.738
So do I.

30:48.738 --> 30:50.767
See what they have on Plummer
at Sing Sing.

30:50.767 --> 30:53.575
Seven years,
he had to make a friend.

30:54.300 --> 30:56.846
I read the file.
It was a good bust, Olivia.

30:56.846 --> 30:59.230
The rape victim ID'd Plummer
in a line-up.

30:59.230 --> 31:01.182
Eyewitnesses are always accurate,
right, Munch?

31:01.182 --> 31:02.851
DNA wasn't used then.

31:02.851 --> 31:04.831
The guy wasn't working,
didn't have an alibi,

31:04.831 --> 31:06.066
couldn't remember where he was

31:06.066 --> 31:09.400
Where were you Thursday night
two weeks ago, say, 8:45?

31:09.400 --> 31:11.902
- I don't know, home.
- Exactly.

31:12.682 --> 31:16.427
This guy was an innocent man
and I helped put him away.

31:16.427 --> 31:19.303
I made the People's case against him
with weak evidence.

31:19.303 --> 31:20.958
That jury believed me.

31:20.958 --> 31:23.901
How many innocent men
have been cleared lately with DNA?

31:23.901 --> 31:24.925
A few.

31:24.925 --> 31:27.776
And even one wrongfully
imprisoned man is too many.

31:27.776 --> 31:29.404
You sound like a legal aid lawyer.

31:29.404 --> 31:30.904
They'd lose their lunch
if they had to stomach

31:30.904 --> 31:32.303
what we deal with every day.

31:32.303 --> 31:34.537
The guy paid a debt he didn't owe,
but what about the rape victim?

31:34.537 --> 31:36.942
She's not getting any justice, either.
The real perp got off.

31:36.942 --> 31:38.539
Statute of limitations is up.

31:38.539 --> 31:41.255
The system's already got
its pound of flesh from Eric Plummer.

31:41.255 --> 31:43.287
He's a victim.

31:43.483 --> 31:46.475
If he's your guy,
he's a predator, not a victim.

31:46.475 --> 31:49.567
We blame all kinds of people
for creating monsters.

31:49.567 --> 31:51.559
Why not ourselves?

32:19.615 --> 32:21.109
Freeze!
Up against the car now!

32:21.109 --> 32:23.011
Take it easy.
Just stay calm. I'm FBI.

32:23.011 --> 32:24.632
Let's see some ID.

32:34.609 --> 32:35.906
Move! Out of my way!
Out of my way!

32:35.906 --> 32:37.732
Put your weapon away, ma'am.
We're FBI.

32:37.732 --> 32:39.156
Why the hell are you tailing me?

32:39.156 --> 32:41.123
Protective detail.

32:43.389 --> 32:46.658
- I told Franklin I didn't want one.
- Wasn't the FBI, ma'am.

32:46.658 --> 32:49.637
Detective Stabler
ordered the detail.

32:58.748 --> 33:01.144
All right. All right.

33:11.846 --> 33:14.083
I didn't tell you about the detail
because I knew you'd refuse.

33:14.083 --> 33:18.052
Only the rat squad puts cops on
other cops, Elliott, without telling them.

33:18.052 --> 33:21.713
I deserve better than that,
especially from you.

33:25.659 --> 33:27.652
You've been under
a lot of stress lately.

33:27.652 --> 33:29.531
I've always backed your play.

33:29.531 --> 33:32.424
And I did what I had to do.

33:32.424 --> 33:33.497
Guy's murdered four people.

33:33.497 --> 33:35.558
What's to stop him
from coming after you, Olivia?

33:35.558 --> 33:39.065
If you can't trust your partner, Elliott,
it's time to get a new one.

33:46.228 --> 33:48.589
We have gotten warrants
before based on less.

33:48.589 --> 33:50.179
Why are you stonewalling?

33:50.179 --> 33:51.856
This is different and you know it.

33:51.856 --> 33:53.507
Once a judge
hears the suspect's history,

33:53.507 --> 33:55.166
he's going to bend over
backwards for the guy.

33:55.166 --> 33:58.438
I saw him, Alex.
Plummer is stalking me.

33:58.438 --> 33:59.585
How did he know where you were

33:59.585 --> 34:01.202
when he was in the interview room
being questioned?

34:01.202 --> 34:02.611
He must have overheard.

34:02.611 --> 34:05.107
Okay. How many businesses are
in the area near Chauncey's?

34:05.107 --> 34:06.764
I don't know, several.

34:06.764 --> 34:08.750
Why?
Where are you going with this?

34:08.750 --> 34:10.806
Any decent defense attorney
is going to say

34:10.806 --> 34:13.245
that Mr. Plummer was in the area
running errands,

34:13.245 --> 34:14.492
that it was just a coincidence.

34:14.492 --> 34:18.876
He has killed four people
and we're doing nothing.

34:18.876 --> 34:21.614
How many drinks did you have?

34:23.728 --> 34:25.975
Olivia, the system
made a mistake before,

34:25.975 --> 34:30.322
now everything we do
is under a microscope.

34:31.635 --> 34:34.248
I wasn't drunk.

34:44.422 --> 34:46.902
Now, under the circumstances,
I'm willing to cut you some slack,

34:46.902 --> 34:49.311
but we don't try for search warrants
until I say so.

34:49.311 --> 34:51.507
I had to do something.

34:51.507 --> 34:53.241
I saw Plummer.

34:53.241 --> 34:55.594
I don't doubt you, Olivia.

34:56.850 --> 34:58.295
Okay.

35:00.443 --> 35:06.026
Captain, I have some
vacation time coming.

35:07.659 --> 35:10.170
Why would you want to do that?

35:10.170 --> 35:12.904
Because I want it too much

35:12.904 --> 35:14.934
and I think I need some distance.

35:14.934 --> 35:17.537
Nobody's questioning your abilities.

35:17.537 --> 35:19.703
I am.

35:23.684 --> 35:27.998
All right. If you need the time,
take it. As of now.

35:30.958 --> 35:32.880
Thank you.

35:50.058 --> 35:52.497
We checked into the suspect's
history at Sing Sing?

35:52.497 --> 35:54.326
Warden says Plummer
started a lot of fights.

35:54.326 --> 35:57.358
That's good survival strategy.
Nobody can get you in the hole.

35:57.358 --> 36:00.177
Only visitor he had was his ex-wife,
even after the divorce.

36:00.177 --> 36:01.650
They corresponded almost daily.

36:01.650 --> 36:02.828
Well, who was Plummer's cellmate?

36:02.828 --> 36:04.609
Murderer by the name
of Russell Williams.

36:04.609 --> 36:06.216
He got paroled in 2000.

36:06.216 --> 36:09.705
He's currently at Rikers Island
awaiting trial on another murder beef.

36:09.705 --> 36:10.770
He's going to want a deal,

36:10.770 --> 36:12.993
but if the D.A.
has a strong case against him,

36:12.993 --> 36:14.815
he'll show us the door.

36:15.969 --> 36:18.038
Office of Executive Assistant
District Attorney
Friday, March 2

36:18.038 --> 36:19.262
Absolutely not.

36:19.262 --> 36:21.083
Russell Williams killed a drug dealer.

36:21.083 --> 36:22.091
A life is a life.

36:22.091 --> 36:23.911
Who are we to decide
whose has more value?

36:23.911 --> 36:25.332
Do you really want me
to show the D.A.

36:25.332 --> 36:29.133
photos of a dead 10-year-old boy
dumped among rotting corpses?

36:33.896 --> 36:37.022
I've got Williams dead to rights.

36:37.022 --> 36:39.407
This time we could
put him away for good.

36:39.407 --> 36:40.674
But if he's got something
we can use,

36:40.674 --> 36:44.162
why can't we offer him 12.5-to-25?

36:47.218 --> 36:49.664
Now, what did Eric do
to get you all heated up

36:49.664 --> 36:51.747
and willing to grab your ankles?

36:51.747 --> 36:54.300
We're wasting our time.
This interview is over!

36:54.300 --> 36:56.981
Eric had a thing
for some female cop.

36:56.981 --> 36:58.896
That's all he talked about.

36:58.896 --> 37:00.013
Do you have proof?

37:00.013 --> 37:01.885
Think I got it on videotape?

37:01.885 --> 37:04.350
You word isn't good enough.

37:05.706 --> 37:08.220
How about hand delivered letters?

37:08.609 --> 37:11.378
Delivered by whom?

37:11.378 --> 37:15.358
From my hand to my old lady
to Eric's wife.

37:15.358 --> 37:17.973
The old prison express.

37:17.973 --> 37:19.971
Avoids the warden's censors.

37:19.971 --> 37:22.017
If he talked to me,

37:22.017 --> 37:25.274
what do you think
he spilled to his old lady?

37:29.339 --> 37:31.551
Home of Eric Plummer
274 West 87th Street
Friday, March 2

37:31.551 --> 37:33.869
You find letters at the ex-wife's
apartment? / Couple dozen.

37:33.869 --> 37:35.964
There's enough to charge
Mrs. Plummer with accessory.

37:35.964 --> 37:38.406
News clippings, photos of Olivia
with the victims,

37:38.406 --> 37:40.828
the obsessive ramblings
of a man on a mission.

37:40.828 --> 37:42.514
It's Benson's collar.
Shouldn't she be here?

37:42.514 --> 37:44.533
Yeah, I left a message
on her machine. She knows.

37:44.533 --> 37:45.832
Bingo.

37:52.446 --> 37:54.191
Let's pick up Plummer.

37:55.255 --> 37:56.273
This is harassment.

37:56.273 --> 37:58.018
I need to know
where Webber is working today.

37:58.018 --> 38:00.403
Norman told me the whole story,
how you put him in prison.

38:00.403 --> 38:03.459
He was exonerated.
First your partner, now you.

38:03.459 --> 38:04.633
Why don't you
leave the man in peace?

38:04.633 --> 38:05.797
What about my partner?

38:05.797 --> 38:08.042
She was here earlier
threatening me with obstruction.

38:08.042 --> 38:10.522
I gave her the address
so she'd leave.

38:10.522 --> 38:12.283
Where is he?

38:36.350 --> 38:39.083
This is Detective
Olivia Benson, from the 16,

38:39.083 --> 38:40.867
badge number 44015.

38:40.867 --> 38:46.669
Shots fired at 653 Avenue D,
Apartment 2.

38:49.914 --> 38:52.657
He says you have to come in.

38:55.029 --> 38:56.549
I can't.

38:56.549 --> 38:58.928
He's going to kill me!

38:58.928 --> 39:01.509
He's not going to hurt you.

39:01.749 --> 39:03.707
He knew you were coming.

39:03.707 --> 39:04.938
He says...

39:04.938 --> 39:08.776
He says to tell you
they didn't suffer.

39:08.776 --> 39:11.353
He says I won't be so lucky.

39:11.353 --> 39:12.739
Oh, God!

39:14.664 --> 39:16.719
I'm coming in!

39:25.064 --> 39:27.437
This is between us, Mr. Plummer.

39:27.437 --> 39:29.577
Why don't you let her go,

39:29.577 --> 39:31.182
and then it's just you and me?

39:31.182 --> 39:32.664
How does it feel, Detective Benson,

39:32.664 --> 39:36.970
to have your credibility shattered
and your life in ruins?

39:36.970 --> 39:38.806
It sucks.

39:38.806 --> 39:40.655
I was innocent.

39:40.655 --> 39:42.697
Yes, you were.

39:42.993 --> 39:45.806
But then you killed
four innocent people.

39:45.806 --> 39:47.580
Three innocent people,
one child abuser.

39:47.580 --> 39:50.181
I thought cops cared
about the facts.

39:50.181 --> 39:51.984
Why did you choose them?

39:53.859 --> 39:57.932
They were suffering and
they needed their misery to end.

39:57.932 --> 40:00.831
Who was going to help them?
You?

40:00.831 --> 40:03.508
I'm sorry for what happened to you.

40:03.508 --> 40:05.755
I really am.

40:05.755 --> 40:08.083
I can't turn back the clock,

40:08.083 --> 40:10.915
but I can testify for you on your behalf

40:10.915 --> 40:15.582
and I can admit in open court
that I am responsible for you.

40:15.582 --> 40:20.522
There's not going to be a trial.
Not this time.

40:21.166 --> 40:23.530
Let her go and
let's just talk about it.

40:23.530 --> 40:26.433
There's nothing to discuss.

40:26.433 --> 40:29.071
Please, Mr. Plummer,

40:30.095 --> 40:32.874
don't think I won't.

40:34.660 --> 40:37.727
Yeah, I'm counting on it,
Detective Benson.

40:37.727 --> 40:40.112
Don't do it!
Drop the weapon!

40:40.297 --> 40:42.263
Drop your weapon!

40:42.263 --> 40:45.254
There aren't any bullets in my gun.

41:11.916 --> 41:15.318
Olivia, it's okay, it's okay.

41:16.955 --> 41:18.780
It's okay.

41:22.430 --> 41:24.972
It wasn't loaded.

41:29.150 --> 41:30.956
Okay, let's go.

41:31.460 --> 41:34.057
- I gotta give my statement.
- I'll take you.

41:34.468 --> 41:36.664
You leave me alone.
