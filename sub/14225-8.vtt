00:02.677 --> 00:05.495
Wait a minute.
I know you.

00:05.531 --> 00:08.148
You're Dr. Hunter Brody,

00:08.183 --> 00:11.902
the host of my
favorite show...
BOTH: <i> For Reals!</i>

00:11.937 --> 00:13.962
Why don't you come track
the Kikiwaka with me?

00:13.997 --> 00:16.665
We could make
scientific history together.

00:16.700 --> 00:18.058
The tracking device is beeping!

00:18.093 --> 00:19.743
It must be the Kikiwaka!

And, cut!

00:28.904 --> 00:32.155
What in the world
is going on here?

00:32.190 --> 00:34.707
Great television,
that's what's going on!

00:34.743 --> 00:38.153
You mean,
this was all fake?
Yep!

00:38.188 --> 00:40.268
I really thought we were
about to find the Kikiwaka.

00:41.900 --> 00:43.066
What was that?

00:43.102 --> 00:46.236
Do you think it's Dr. Brody
trying to trick us again?

00:46.271 --> 00:48.305
No, he is back with Zuri!

00:48.340 --> 00:49.581
(GROWLING)

00:50.934 --> 00:53.626
That was the real Kikiwaka!

00:53.662 --> 00:55.622
And it just went into the camp!

01:03.397 --> 01:06.815
Sorry you had to come
here on a fake Kikiwaka
sighting, Officer.

01:06.851 --> 01:10.168
Although you can still
slap the cuffs on me.
I've been a bad girl.

01:10.204 --> 01:12.087
(GIGGLING)

01:12.122 --> 01:14.305
(GASPING) Please come back!

01:14.341 --> 01:15.741
That pillow with
George Clooney's
face on it

01:15.776 --> 01:20.112
isn't doing it for me anymore!

01:20.147 --> 01:24.575
I don't understand.
Guys, the Kikiwaka was here!
We saw it.

01:24.610 --> 01:25.700
(ALL GROANING)

01:27.971 --> 01:30.430
I can't believe
you two woke me up!

01:30.465 --> 01:32.549
I was having
the most delicious
dream about my Xandy.

01:32.584 --> 01:34.292
Two words, sailor suit!

01:36.280 --> 01:38.013
Just because you
bought it for me,

01:38.048 --> 01:39.688
doesn't mean I have to wear it.

01:42.828 --> 01:45.654
Enough with
the Kikiwaka already!

01:45.689 --> 01:48.832
You're never going
to find it, and you're
driving everyone crazy!

01:48.867 --> 01:50.267
In your case,
that's a short drive.

01:52.137 --> 01:56.865
I have never been
so humiliated
in my entire life.

01:56.900 --> 01:59.284
How about the time you fell
off the stage after you won
the science fair?

01:59.361 --> 02:01.521
Or the time you participated
in the science fair?

02:03.114 --> 02:05.473
Okay, okay, I get it!

02:05.508 --> 02:07.342
You two are in big trouble!

02:07.378 --> 02:10.704
What did I say about using
the emergency phone?

02:10.739 --> 02:12.823
BOTH: (SIGHING) Never use it
for Kikiwaka sightings

02:12.858 --> 02:14.418
or calls
to the health department.

02:16.770 --> 02:20.313
I'm sorry, Gladys,
but we did see the Kikiwaka!

02:20.348 --> 02:24.693
And it walked into the camp.
The hairy monster was here!

02:24.728 --> 02:29.289
Please, the only hairy
monsters in this camp are
the kids in Badger Cabin.

02:29.324 --> 02:31.444
That cabin
must have been built
on an ancient boneyard.

02:31.460 --> 02:33.780
They all magically hit puberty
at the exact same time.

02:35.680 --> 02:38.840
<i>Okay, everyone,
back to your cabins!</i>

02:38.875 --> 02:42.395
<i>Lights out immediately,</i>
<i>or I'll swap out your toilet</i>
<i>paper with dry leaves.</i>

02:44.305 --> 02:45.705
Jorge!

02:45.740 --> 02:48.116
What is in your hair?

02:48.151 --> 02:51.311
Curlers. You think
these luxurious locks
come naturally?

02:53.932 --> 02:56.141
<i>¶ Here we go</i>

02:56.177 --> 02:58.860

02:58.895 --> 03:00.704
<i>¶ Let's gather by

<i>¶ And sing this song</i>

ALL: <i> ¶ Kikiwaka, Kikiwaka ¶</i>

03:52.875 --> 03:56.093
I can't wait for my very first
Kikiwaka Day festival.

03:56.128 --> 03:58.929
It is awesome!
And like every year,

03:58.964 --> 04:00.497
my Kiki-Dogs
are going to outsell

04:00.532 --> 04:04.159
all the other booths,
or my nickname isn't
"The Wacky Woodchuck."

04:04.194 --> 04:05.727
That's your nickname?

04:05.762 --> 04:09.097
I've been trying
to get it started.

04:09.132 --> 04:11.041
Well, this year you're going
to have some competition.

04:11.076 --> 04:13.484
I'm in charge
of selling Cookie-Wakas.

04:13.520 --> 04:15.971
Pshaw! What do you know
about selling food?

04:16.006 --> 04:18.081
Back in New York,
I worked at the snack shack
in Central Park.

04:18.117 --> 04:21.802
Once I made $50,000 in one day.

04:21.837 --> 04:25.304
Wow, how much are
hamburgers in New York?

04:25.340 --> 04:27.860
Not that much.
I sold my diamond ring
to a rich tourist.

04:29.177 --> 04:31.652
<i>¶ I'm strumming,
humming, buzzing</i>

04:31.688 --> 04:34.089
<i>¶ When you're close to me</i>

04:34.124 --> 04:35.724
<i>¶ And I don't ask why</i>

04:39.771 --> 04:42.780
<i>¶ I could try to find the answer</i>

04:42.816 --> 04:48.194
<i>¶ But I might as well count
the stars up in the sky</i>

04:48.230 --> 04:51.472
<i>¶ And all that really matters</i>
<i>is you make me feel</i>
<i>like I can fly... ¶</i>

04:51.508 --> 04:54.226
Can it, pretty boy!

04:54.261 --> 04:57.069
You've got work to do.
Go put on your
mascot costume.

04:57.105 --> 04:59.145
Fine. I hope they got
the fleas out of it.

05:02.644 --> 05:06.404
Now, he's gonna come back
dressed in a Kikiwaka costume.

05:06.440 --> 05:09.307
Do not call the authorities.
Unless it's
the fire department.

05:09.342 --> 05:10.592
Those guys are smokin'.

05:14.523 --> 05:18.324
I ordered 300 Kikiwaka dolls,
and you sent me

05:18.359 --> 05:22.245
300 kick balls!
What am I supposed
to do with these?

05:22.281 --> 05:24.641
I certainly will not
put them there!

05:27.143 --> 05:30.345
Hey, Gladys, I can
get those dolls for ya.

05:30.380 --> 05:33.423
You can?
Because the whole town
comes to this festival,

05:33.459 --> 05:35.158
and the money I make today,
I use to buy food,

05:35.193 --> 05:39.762
pay the workers,
and my toe wart acid
is not cheap.

05:39.797 --> 05:43.083
Well, that explains the funny
walk and that burning smell.

05:44.536 --> 05:48.138
How are you gonna get all
those dolls made in time?

05:48.173 --> 05:50.932
You've got a built-in
workforce here,

05:50.967 --> 05:52.475
and I'm just the one
to motivate them.

05:52.511 --> 05:56.471
Well, if you can do that,
you can have
whatever you want.

05:56.506 --> 05:59.426
Oh, but my Channing Tatum
back scratcher
is off the table.

05:59.751 --> 06:01.226
It was never on the table.

06:02.812 --> 06:04.104
I wanna use your shower.

06:04.139 --> 06:06.347
Deal. But why?

06:06.383 --> 06:08.791
Because I heard the water
is actually hot.

06:08.826 --> 06:12.487
Unlike the soup here,
which is so cold
it chipped my tooth.

06:20.263 --> 06:21.579
Get your Cookie-Wakas here!

06:23.967 --> 06:25.767
Each one comes with a kiss.

06:28.814 --> 06:30.847
Well played, Ross!

06:30.883 --> 06:34.083
Hey, guys, if you buy
my Kiki-Dogs, Emma
will give you two kisses!

06:37.564 --> 06:41.233
Lou, do me a favor,
and don't put any onions
on those hot dogs.

06:41.268 --> 06:44.093
Come get your
Waka-Burgers! 100% beef,

06:44.128 --> 06:48.448
unlike Lou's Kiki-Dogs,
which will probably fetch
if you throw something.

06:48.484 --> 06:49.484
Ruff! Ruff!

06:51.503 --> 06:53.628
That is not true!

06:53.663 --> 06:55.981
These hot dogs are made
from the choicest cuts
of moose.

06:56.016 --> 06:58.658
That's good eats, people!

06:58.694 --> 07:01.720
Wow, Hazel's really competitive.

07:01.755 --> 07:03.955
That's because whichever girl
makes the most money
from her booth

07:03.991 --> 07:05.657
is named Kikiwaka Queen.

07:05.692 --> 07:08.776
And Xander is the Kikiwaka King.

07:08.811 --> 07:10.152
Because he's
the coolest guy at camp?

07:10.188 --> 07:13.188
That, and he's the only one
who can stand the smell
of the suit.

07:15.635 --> 07:19.086
Wow, you guys are doing great!

07:19.122 --> 07:22.774
Ooh, Jorge, that's some
awesome needlework.

07:22.851 --> 07:25.526
But why would you put
red lipstick on a Kikiwaka?

07:25.562 --> 07:26.722
That's blood.

07:29.191 --> 07:31.351
I keep forgetting which
is the pointy end
of the needle.

07:31.977 --> 07:36.454
Ow! That one!

07:36.490 --> 07:38.865
Wow, these kids
aren't completely
worthless after all.

07:38.900 --> 07:40.274
How'd you do it?

07:40.309 --> 07:42.519
Easy.

07:42.554 --> 07:45.505
Remember, the first camper
to finish 20 dolls

07:45.540 --> 07:49.242
gets a delicious
pizza delivered.

07:49.277 --> 07:52.717
Awesome! That sure beats those
stale tortillas with ketchup
they serve in here.

07:54.983 --> 07:57.149
Ketchup? What am I,
made of gold?

07:57.185 --> 07:58.945
It's just water and red dye.

08:02.599 --> 08:06.784
I cannot believe that in
an entire camp library,

08:06.819 --> 08:09.295
this is the only
photographic evidence
of the Kikiwaka.

08:09.331 --> 08:11.606
That's a Kikiwaka?

08:11.642 --> 08:14.784
Or a bear, or our groundskeeper.

08:14.819 --> 08:17.059
That guy really needs
to mow himself!

08:18.232 --> 08:19.989
Keep looking.
We must find proof.

08:20.024 --> 08:24.210
I know. I'm sick of being
the laughingstock
of this camp.

08:24.246 --> 08:27.305
You and me, both.
Do you know who made
fun of me today?

08:27.340 --> 08:30.633
Weak Bladder Brian.

08:30.669 --> 08:33.709
Because of him,
there's more urine
in the lake than lake!

08:36.083 --> 08:39.092
Wait, I think I found something.

08:39.127 --> 08:42.128
According to ancient legends,
the beast is attracted

08:42.164 --> 08:44.814
to a pungent plant called
the putriberry.

08:44.849 --> 08:47.976
Apparently, it is
like Kikiwaka catnip.

08:48.011 --> 08:50.703
So let's find some
of those berries
in the forest,

08:50.738 --> 08:53.832
catch the Kikiwaka,
and redeem ourselves
in the eyes of the camp.

08:53.867 --> 08:57.710
Good idea! Then,
we will have nothing left
to be embarrassed about.

08:57.746 --> 09:00.379
Except our slow obstacle
course times.

09:00.415 --> 09:02.198
True. That bell
will never be unrung.

09:10.842 --> 09:13.326
Attention!

09:13.362 --> 09:15.522
Buy a Waka Burger and get
a free photo with this guy.

09:18.908 --> 09:21.367
I can't believe Hazel
thinks that lame thing
is going to attract anyone.

09:21.403 --> 09:23.344
Must. Buy. Burger.

09:26.191 --> 09:27.473
XANDER: Lou,
snap out of it!

09:30.495 --> 09:32.870
You guys have to sell
more stuff than Hazel.

09:32.905 --> 09:35.657
He's just worried
because if Hazel
becomes Kikiwaka Queen,

09:35.659 --> 09:37.975
he'll have to dance with her
in front of everybody.

09:38.011 --> 09:39.903
She's going to shake
her groove thing at me.

09:39.938 --> 09:42.046
(LOU CHUCKLING)

09:42.082 --> 09:44.924
Don't worry, Xander,
Hazel's not going to win.

09:44.960 --> 09:47.176
My cookies are made
with a secret ingredient.

09:47.212 --> 09:50.671
Emma, love is not
a secret ingredient.

09:50.707 --> 09:53.827
Forget love. I'm
talking about an
extra pound of butter.

09:53.868 --> 09:55.985
Hey, everyone!

09:56.020 --> 09:58.029
I hear those Kiki-Dogs
aren't just moose meat.

09:58.064 --> 09:59.839
They've got other parts
in them, too.

09:59.874 --> 10:02.567
That is a lie!

10:02.602 --> 10:05.002
Okay, maybe one hoof fell in
the grinder, but that is it!

10:06.013 --> 10:07.931
We cannot let Hazel win.

10:07.966 --> 10:11.384
Lou, we have to team up.
We need to get
people's attention.

10:11.419 --> 10:14.078
I have an idea.

10:14.113 --> 10:17.064
All we'll need is a
bendy straw, a raccoon,
and a Bunsen burner.

10:17.099 --> 10:19.259
As curious as I am,
I have a better idea.

10:57.507 --> 10:59.182
Let's go, Xandy!

10:59.217 --> 11:02.635
Come sing a song about me!

11:02.670 --> 11:06.197
And that song would be titled,
<i>There's a Crazy Girl Who</i>
<i>Won't Leave Me Alone!</i>

11:06.232 --> 11:09.892
That's kind of a long
title. I'd probably just
call it <i> Crazy Girl.</i>

11:09.928 --> 11:13.730
I'm going to make
the most money, and be
Xander's Kikiwaka Queen,

11:13.765 --> 11:16.407
and we'll live happily
ever after in my cave.

Zuri, those dolls you made me
are selling like crazy!

11:34.052 --> 11:35.935
I need 200 more!

11:35.971 --> 11:37.854
What? That's impossible!

11:37.889 --> 11:43.584
These kids have already
inhaled so much yarn,
their farts are fuzzy.

11:43.620 --> 11:45.769
How about instead
of one hot shower,

11:45.805 --> 11:48.114
I let you have them
for the entire summer?

11:48.150 --> 11:52.126
200 more dolls, coming right up!

11:52.162 --> 11:55.004
Hey, Zuri. I'm done
with my dolls. I'm gonna
get my face painted,

11:55.039 --> 11:56.799
and maybe a pint
or two of O-negative.

11:57.959 --> 11:59.909
No, you can't!

11:59.944 --> 12:02.320
We need to make 200 more dolls,

12:02.355 --> 12:04.480
or Gladys won't let me use
the shower that has hot water!

12:04.515 --> 12:06.291
(ALL GASP)

12:06.326 --> 12:08.566
Wait, that's why
we're doing this?

12:09.312 --> 12:12.947
And there are showers here?

12:12.982 --> 12:15.302
Yes! Now get your bloodless
husk of a body back to work.

12:17.803 --> 12:21.580
Wait a minute, did
you even order pizza?

12:21.616 --> 12:25.435
Yes! I mean...
I would have
if I had a phone.

12:25.470 --> 12:26.069
(WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY)

12:26.104 --> 12:28.771
Okay, that's it!

12:28.807 --> 12:33.935
Fellow workers, we've been
breaking our backs for hours,

12:33.970 --> 12:36.251
my pants are full of fuzz,
and there's no pizza coming!

12:38.300 --> 12:42.143
Carbs are bad for you.
You're welcome.

12:42.178 --> 12:45.596
It's time to take a stand!
We need to rise up
against management.

12:45.632 --> 12:47.257
Viva la pizza!

ZURI: Guys, wait!
Please, come back.

12:52.463 --> 12:57.016
Why should we?
You used us, and that's not
how friends treat each other.

13:01.872 --> 13:03.032
Don't look at me like that.

13:05.243 --> 13:08.319
EMMA: (GASPING) OMG!

13:08.354 --> 13:11.889
Whoa! Was there
a monster truck rally
nobody told me about?

13:11.924 --> 13:13.557
Lou, why did you leave
the booths unattended

13:13.592 --> 13:15.935
while I was in the bathroom?

13:15.970 --> 13:17.311
I'm so sorry,
but the face painter
was about to leave

13:17.346 --> 13:18.826
and I really wanted
to be a kitty.

13:21.301 --> 13:22.174
How did this happen?

13:22.209 --> 13:24.185
Gee, take a wild guess.

13:24.220 --> 13:26.670
(GROANING)
Hazel!

13:26.706 --> 13:28.522
Why did you wreck our booths?

13:28.558 --> 13:30.349
It wasn't me.
It was a freak storm.

13:30.384 --> 13:32.784
You're holding a sledgehammer!

13:33.221 --> 13:36.339
No, I'm not.

13:36.374 --> 13:41.485
Oh, well, I guess neither
of you guys is going
to be the Kikiwaka Queen.

13:41.521 --> 13:43.696
But don't cry, Lou.
I don't want your
whiskers to run.

13:43.731 --> 13:48.393
(HISSING AND YOWLING)

13:48.428 --> 13:51.437
That is it. We are gonna
get Hazel back, or they don't
call me The Wacky Woodchuck.

13:51.472 --> 13:52.188
They don't call you that.

13:52.223 --> 13:53.223
I know.

13:59.488 --> 14:01.530
RAVI: Do you think
we have gone far enough?

14:01.566 --> 14:06.185
Well, I don't wanna
walk anymore, so, yes.

14:06.220 --> 14:10.247
Let us see if we can
lure the Kikiwaka out
with these putriberries.

14:10.282 --> 14:12.066
And if that doesn't work,
we should just live
in the forest.

14:12.102 --> 14:13.635
At least no one out here
will mock us.

14:13.670 --> 14:15.803
(CROW CAWING)

14:15.839 --> 14:17.519
That bird was mocking us, right?

14:19.142 --> 14:21.417
Pretty sure.

14:21.453 --> 14:26.097
(GAGS) No wonder these
are called putriberries and
not new-car-smell berries.

14:26.132 --> 14:30.167
If my nose could
vomit, it would!

14:30.203 --> 14:32.123
Okay, let us hide behind
that tree over there.

14:36.892 --> 14:39.653
So, how long do you think
we'll have to wait
for the Kikiwaka?

14:45.785 --> 14:48.327
(GROWLING)
Not long.

14:48.362 --> 14:50.046
(BOTH SCREAMING)

14:57.814 --> 14:59.730
I can't run anymore!

14:59.765 --> 15:00.765
Hide behind that rock!

15:04.337 --> 15:07.229
I've never run
so fast in my life!

15:07.265 --> 15:10.266
Take that, Coach Dunlap!

15:10.301 --> 15:13.903
Do you think
we lost him?
Maybe.

15:13.938 --> 15:16.372
You are still holding
on to the camera?

15:16.408 --> 15:19.441
Yes. And I was pointing it
at him the whole time
we were running.

15:19.477 --> 15:23.087
Huzzah! Um, I mean...
(WHISPERING) Huzzah.

Zuri, what is going on?
Why are these kids protesting?

15:48.757 --> 15:54.110
Because as the sign says,
Zuri Ross is a poopy boss.

15:54.145 --> 15:57.213
Well, I need more dolls.
Get those kids back to work.

15:57.248 --> 15:59.568
Little tip, there's a Taser
under my bed if you need it.

16:00.726 --> 16:02.509
No way.

16:02.545 --> 16:04.704
Don't worry, they'll be fine.

16:04.739 --> 16:07.189
They twitch for an hour,
and they bounce right back.

16:07.224 --> 16:10.068
Look, it's bad enough
that I used my friends.

16:10.103 --> 16:14.597
I'm certainly not going
to shock the shorts
off of 'em.

16:14.632 --> 16:17.742
Do it, or you won't
get your hot shower.

16:17.777 --> 16:20.661
You know what?
I don't care.
I was wrong,

16:20.696 --> 16:23.964
and I'm gonna make it right.

Hey, guys, here's
the pizza I promised you.

16:27.286 --> 16:29.378
I thought you
didn't have a phone.

I don't. I used
the emergency phone.

What?

16:33.642 --> 16:35.682
Sorry, Gladys. You should
really hide that better.

wanted to come over

to win Kikiwaka Queen.

to gloat but... I win!

while you were in
the bathroom earlier,

we put putriberries
in your burgers, just
to give 'em a little zing.

your Waka-Burgers

lot of trouble with Gladys.

But... At least we
are outcasts together.

to be shunned with someone,
I'm really glad it's you.
