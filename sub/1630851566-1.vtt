...makes him the kind of man
the government's gonna need.

to apply for a job.

27:50.977 --> 27:54.573
If I didn't think you meant so well,
I'd feel like slapping your face.

28:00.153 --> 28:03.783
On that one point, Sandra,
we deeply understand each other.

28:05.124 --> 28:07.525
- Don't miss your little train, Maggie.
- I won't.

28:22.208 --> 28:24.370
I want to make a party-to-party call.

28:24.544 --> 28:25.876
What?

28:26.479 --> 28:27.970
Person-to-person call then.

28:28.147 --> 28:29.638
Mr. Peter Van Allen.

28:29.816 --> 28:32.342
V-A-N A-L-L-E-N. In New York.

28:32.518 --> 28:37.047
Gramercy, 550264.
If he's not there, try the Racquet Club.

28:37.223 --> 28:39.954
If he's not there, try the Yale Club.
Find him.

28:40.126 --> 28:43.255
His wife, Mrs. Van Allen, is calling.
Hurry it up.

28:51.304 --> 28:53.739
- Jefferson, whose car is that?
- Mr. Pete's.

28:55.808 --> 28:58.471
- When did he come?
- This morning.

28:58.644 --> 28:59.703
Why didn't you tell me?

28:59.879 --> 29:03.043
Violet promised me she'd sweep him
out of the house with the trash...

29:03.216 --> 29:05.208
...while I was getting you
from the station.

29:05.384 --> 29:06.716
But why didn't you tell me?

29:06.886 --> 29:10.721
Well, we wasn't gonna say anything
if Violet done got him cleared out.

29:10.890 --> 29:13.416
You done had all the botheration
you can stand.

29:13.593 --> 29:17.291
I heard a roar like thunder and in come
this machine a-flying through the gate.

29:17.463 --> 29:19.091
It done tore down part of the gate.

29:19.265 --> 29:22.394
Slammed on the brakes and might've
thrown itself through the window.

29:22.568 --> 29:23.627
VIOLET: Miss Maggie.
- Yes?

29:23.803 --> 29:25.829
We tried every means
at our disposal...

29:26.005 --> 29:28.600
...outside of witchcraft,
to get him out of the house.

29:28.774 --> 29:30.470
But he wasn't in no moving mood.

29:40.586 --> 29:43.146
MAGGIE: I do think you have your nerve.
- Now, hold your horses.

29:43.322 --> 29:45.052
I will not. This isn't a roadhouse...

29:45.224 --> 29:48.820
...that you can drop in and out of.
I don't want you here. Go to your wife.

29:48.995 --> 29:50.520
- Don't be a fool.
- Don't touch me.

29:50.696 --> 29:53.359
Let's not brawl.
At least listen to what I have to say.

A prisoner has a chance to speak
before he's sentenced.

You sound like a book,
a cheap one.

29:58.938 --> 30:01.310
I thought the line was
a good simile for me.

30:01.541 --> 30:02.600
All right, laugh.

30:03.543 --> 30:07.310
Supposing I admit I haven't had
a particularly happy time lately.

30:07.613 --> 30:08.637
It's been a shock.

30:08.814 --> 30:12.717
I did love you more than anything else
in the world and it does hurt.

30:12.885 --> 30:15.286
Now, what could you say
that would alter that? What?

30:15.454 --> 30:18.288
Do you suppose I'd come here
if I didn't have something to say?

30:18.457 --> 30:20.362
Definitely bearing on
what you've just said.

30:20.479 --> 30:21.981
No, but what about your wife?

30:22.128 --> 30:23.790
Sandra?

30:23.963 --> 30:27.365
Well, Sandra was not properly divorced
from my predecessor, Mr. Stokes...

30:27.533 --> 30:29.593
...when it was thought
that we were married.

30:29.769 --> 30:32.034
The necessity
for a second marriage ceremony...

30:32.205 --> 30:35.403
...was explained to me by my lawyer,
Jock Thompson, last Wednesday...

30:35.575 --> 30:37.066
...when I came here to see you.

30:37.243 --> 30:38.541
But you didn't tell me that.

30:38.711 --> 30:42.079
I should liked to have told you,
but I had a clear duty ahead of me.

30:42.248 --> 30:44.945
I returned and explained the situation
to Sandra.

30:45.117 --> 30:47.882
I asked her to marry me
when her divorce papers were final.

30:48.054 --> 30:49.647
That was yesterday, Tuesday.

30:49.822 --> 30:52.951
But she preferred to go to Philadelphia
and perform on her piano.

30:53.125 --> 30:54.957
So I waited in New York
until midnight.

30:55.127 --> 30:58.757
And then by every stroke
of my conscience, I was free.

31:00.099 --> 31:02.000
So I came down here
to tell you about it.

31:02.168 --> 31:05.730

about myself, haven't I?

on Miss Maggie's face like that.

01:35:50.652 --> 01:35:51.915
No, she didn't.

01:35:52.087 --> 01:35:55.285
Well, then, my darling,
don't you think you've let me down a little?

01:35:56.391 --> 01:35:57.415
How?

01:35:57.593 --> 01:36:00.188
Well, I don't know
why Sandra came here.

01:36:00.362 --> 01:36:03.127
But I'm sure she came here
for some reason.

01:36:03.298 --> 01:36:06.757
And I particularly wanted her to see
how happy we are.

01:36:06.935 --> 01:36:08.028
We are happy, aren't we?

01:36:12.007 --> 01:36:13.976
Of course.

01:36:15.677 --> 01:36:19.546
Then, my darling, don't you think you could
have taken some other way of showing it?

01:36:19.715 --> 01:36:22.275
You hardly ate. You hardly spoke.

01:36:22.618 --> 01:36:25.554
Anyone would think that I beat you
in private.

01:36:25.721 --> 01:36:27.189
I'm sorry.

01:36:28.957 --> 01:36:33.395
Maggie, there's something between us
tonight.

01:36:33.562 --> 01:36:38.262
I don't know what it is
but it's like flying in a fog.

01:36:38.667 --> 01:36:41.603
I can't seem to get my bearings
and I don't like it.

01:36:41.770 --> 01:36:44.968
We've always told each other everything,
haven't we?

01:36:45.140 --> 01:36:47.609
That's been the great thing.
No secrets.

01:36:47.776 --> 01:36:51.008
Always honest with each other,
haven't we?

01:36:51.747 --> 01:36:55.479
Well, then don't you think you can tell me
what's making you unhappy?

01:36:59.254 --> 01:37:01.689
Maggie, I think I know what it is.

01:37:01.857 --> 01:37:04.850
It's Sandra. Her being here
is what upset you, hasn't it?

01:37:05.027 --> 01:37:09.522
And you think that-- Well, that I still
find her attractive, don't you?

01:37:10.966 --> 01:37:12.400
Do you?

01:37:12.768 --> 01:37:15.067
I'd be lying to you
if I said anything else.

01:37:15.237 --> 01:37:17.536
Any man would find Sandra attractive.

01:37:17.706 --> 01:37:20.073
Perhaps even a little exciting.

01:37:20.809 --> 01:37:24.041
But you see, Maggie,
I'm not just any man now.

01:37:24.213 --> 01:37:26.808
I'm your husband.
The father of Young Pete.

01:37:26.982 --> 01:37:30.180
And believe me,
that makes a whale of a difference.

01:37:31.587 --> 01:37:33.783
You and Young Pete.

01:37:34.489 --> 01:37:37.220
You'd have to be a man
to know what that means.

01:37:38.860 --> 01:37:40.829
But it's the tops.

01:37:50.320 --> 01:37:51.445
What time is it, Violet?

01:37:51.515 --> 01:37:53.462
I didn't get to sleep till early
this morning.

01:37:53.609 --> 01:37:56.443
It's 10:00.
I've laid your clothes out.

01:37:56.912 --> 01:37:59.108
That wretched lunch.
What am I going to do?

01:37:59.281 --> 01:38:03.309
The first thing you'll do is drink your coffee.
There ain't nobody coming for an hour.

01:38:03.485 --> 01:38:06.284
And me and Jefferson done got everything
under control.

01:38:06.455 --> 01:38:08.788
Well, give them their mint juleps
when they arrive.

01:38:08.957 --> 01:38:10.858
And then smoked turkey
and Virginia ham...

01:38:11.026 --> 01:38:13.291
...and then all the hot dishes
out on the buffet.

01:38:13.462 --> 01:38:16.523
I don't want anything to go wrong,
Violet.

01:38:17.766 --> 01:38:20.133
Oh, is Kovak up yet?

01:38:20.302 --> 01:38:22.294
Her? Laws, yes.
She was up with the birds.

01:38:22.471 --> 01:38:26.499
Had breakfast and then come
to the nursery and took the baby.

01:38:26.675 --> 01:38:28.303
Where?

01:38:29.878 --> 01:38:33.747
What's the matter with you this morning?
You're as white as the tablecloth.

01:38:33.915 --> 01:38:37.875
She just took him for a little walk.
They is down on the lawn.

01:38:48.030 --> 01:38:50.499
- He's not a bit afraid, is he?
- No. No.

01:38:50.999 --> 01:38:53.127
You're not afraid, are you?

Take your time. I'm getting acquainted
with this young man.

He's a darling.

01:39:17.125 --> 01:39:18.286
Yes, isn't he?

01:39:18.760 --> 01:39:20.285

Here, Miss Maggie.

01:39:45.354 --> 01:39:46.982
MAGGIE:
Pete.

01:39:47.689 --> 01:39:49.715
- Pete.
- Maggie.

01:39:50.359 --> 01:39:52.919
I've changed my mind since last night.

01:39:53.673 --> 01:39:54.953
If you think I'll stand by,

01:39:54.985 --> 01:39:58.302
let Pete think that child is yours
and say nothing, you're crazy.

01:40:05.107 --> 01:40:07.508
Why didn't you tell him the truth
when he came back?

01:40:07.676 --> 01:40:08.803
Why did you lie to him?

01:40:09.277 --> 01:40:10.438
I didn't lie to him.

01:40:10.612 --> 01:40:12.444
Pete thinks that child is yours.

01:40:14.916 --> 01:40:16.612
He is.

01:40:18.019 --> 01:40:20.579
- What?
- I didn't lie to Pete.

01:40:20.756 --> 01:40:22.247
The child is mine.

01:40:22.424 --> 01:40:25.883
Your part was finished
the minute you gave that baby to me.

01:40:26.061 --> 01:40:28.530
From that day on,
I had only one purpose in my life...

01:40:28.697 --> 01:40:32.566
...to make that baby mine
and to forget that you ever existed.

01:40:33.135 --> 01:40:36.105
So you told Pete the baby was yours.

01:40:36.805 --> 01:40:38.535
What did you think I'd do about that?

01:40:39.040 --> 01:40:43.444
Oh, I don't know what I thought.
That you'd never come back.

01:40:43.612 --> 01:40:46.343
That perhaps you'd marry
and stay away for years.

01:40:46.515 --> 01:40:48.143
Perhaps you'd die.

01:40:48.316 --> 01:40:49.443
I hoped you would.

01:40:50.385 --> 01:40:53.617
But I didn't die and I haven't stayed away,
and I want that child.

01:40:54.523 --> 01:40:57.516
Sandra, you walked away from
that baby without one backward look.

01:40:57.588 --> 01:40:58.524
I've seen him.

01:40:58.565 --> 01:41:00.504
You could have anytime.
We made no rule.

01:41:00.598 --> 01:41:01.793
I was in Australia.

01:41:01.897 --> 01:41:05.698
It takes more than an ocean to keep a
mother from a child she really wants to see.

01:41:05.867 --> 01:41:08.769
All those months, you never
wrote me one line asking about him.

01:41:08.937 --> 01:41:11.600
You were perfectly satisfied to have him
off your hands.

01:41:11.773 --> 01:41:14.743
Why, if that had been my child,
I'd have never given him up.

01:41:14.910 --> 01:41:17.641
But he's not your child
and you're going to give him up.

01:41:17.813 --> 01:41:21.409
You could justify that lie to yourself,
but you can't justify it to Pete.

01:41:21.583 --> 01:41:23.677
He'll never forgive you, Maggie.

01:41:23.852 --> 01:41:25.821
Oh, you're not going to tell Pete,
are you?

01:41:25.987 --> 01:41:29.355
You see, you're afraid. You don't dare
tell him how you've lied to him.

01:41:29.524 --> 01:41:31.705
I'll tell you something else
you're afraid of.

01:41:31.730 --> 01:41:33.679
You're afraid you'll lose Pete.
You will.

01:41:33.829 --> 01:41:35.889
He never loved you as he loved me.

01:41:36.064 --> 01:41:39.034
You were second choice.
You caught him on the rebound.

01:41:39.201 --> 01:41:43.195
There's only one thing holding him
to you, Maggie, and that's my baby.

01:41:43.371 --> 01:41:46.341
I'd be too proud to hold a man
with another woman's child.

01:41:57.519 --> 01:41:59.044
Pete...

01:41:59.221 --> 01:42:01.053
...come here.

01:42:08.196 --> 01:42:09.562
- What's the matter?
- Sit down.

01:42:09.731 --> 01:42:12.565
- I've got something to tell you.
- Oh, what?

01:42:13.802 --> 01:42:16.237
I've lied to you about Young Pete.

01:42:16.571 --> 01:42:17.664
What do you mean?

01:42:17.839 --> 01:42:19.865
I mean, he isn't mine.

01:42:20.475 --> 01:42:24.037
- What are you talking about?
- He belongs to Sandra.

01:42:24.212 --> 01:42:25.407
Sandra's his mother.

01:42:28.583 --> 01:42:30.484
He's mine, Pete.

01:42:30.785 --> 01:42:32.720
Yours and mine.

01:42:34.756 --> 01:42:37.123
I'll tell you as simply as I can.

01:42:37.425 --> 01:42:40.224
When you were in South America
before you were missing...

01:42:40.395 --> 01:42:43.092
...Sandra told me she was going
to have a child.

01:42:43.265 --> 01:42:44.893
Your child.

01:42:45.367 --> 01:42:48.565
And then when you didn't come back
and we thought you were dead...

01:42:48.970 --> 01:42:52.907
...well, it wasn't an easy situation
for Sandra to face alone...

01:42:53.074 --> 01:42:56.067
...so I went away with her and stayed
until Young Pete was born.

01:42:57.546 --> 01:43:00.015
Then I persuaded her
to let me take him.

01:43:00.181 --> 01:43:04.141
It was the only way he could have
the place in life he was entitled to.

01:43:04.619 --> 01:43:06.645
He was your son.

01:43:08.924 --> 01:43:11.792
So Sandra gave him up...

01:43:12.861 --> 01:43:14.352
...so he could have that place.

Oh.

01:43:22.470 --> 01:43:25.406
That's why you went to Arizona alone.

01:43:25.974 --> 01:43:29.308
That's why you didn't take Violet
or Aunt Ada with you.

01:43:29.878 --> 01:43:32.575
- Yes.
- Yes.

I thought there was something funny.

01:43:37.285 --> 01:43:41.985
You were always so shy
about taking the credit for Young Pete.

01:43:43.124 --> 01:43:45.684
And I remember you saying once:

01:43:46.394 --> 01:43:49.660
"No matter who the mother is,
the baby would be perfect."

01:43:50.532 --> 01:43:52.023
Yeah.

at Maggie about that baby.
