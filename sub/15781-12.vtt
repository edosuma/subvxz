07:55.174 --> 07:56.437
Al, quit eyeballing
the Nance.

07:56.509 --> 07:57.340
We're on a case.

07:57.410 --> 07:59.504
Yeah, I think
I'd remember this one.

07:59.579 --> 08:00.979
I don't even want to think about

08:01.047 --> 08:02.743
what this mess looked
like back then.

08:02.815 --> 08:03.748
Could not have been good.

08:03.816 --> 08:05.341
Maybe on a lonely
night...

08:05.418 --> 08:07.148
I've never been
that drunk,

08:07.220 --> 08:08.449
and I've never been
that desperate.

08:08.521 --> 08:10.149
Sorry, kid.

Relax!

09:06.412 --> 09:08.074
I just want to talk to you.

09:08.147 --> 09:09.638
I -- I didn't steal
those games!

09:09.715 --> 09:12.184
They were defective so they're
just being thrown out!

09:12.251 --> 09:13.742
I'm not mall security!

09:13.819 --> 09:14.752
What -- so who are you?

09:14.820 --> 09:16.755
[whip cracks ]
He works with me.

09:16.822 --> 09:19.189
He's The Alchemist,
seeker of truth.

09:19.258 --> 09:21.625
You're a superhero guy and
you're hanging out with Hank?

09:21.694 --> 09:24.528
Look, Pudgy McTalk-a-lot,
I just got dumped by my lover

09:24.597 --> 09:27.863
who then tossed me out
on my jobless ass

09:27.934 --> 09:30.062
so I had to move in
with my boring team member

09:30.136 --> 09:33.334
who lives in the 'burbs
and never does squat!

09:33.406 --> 09:35.875
And I just -- I just told you
too much, didn't I!

09:35.942 --> 09:37.535
Uh, dude, no shit.

09:37.610 --> 09:39.511
Geez, Al,
let the palooka down.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.775
We have a couple more questions
about your case.

09:41.847 --> 09:44.009
Case?
I needed a ride home, doofus.

09:44.083 --> 09:47.076
What is this, "the case of my
mom forgot her cellphone"?

09:47.153 --> 09:48.177
No, Wisenheimer!

09:48.254 --> 09:50.189
It's the case of "you tell us
the truth

09:50.256 --> 09:51.884
or Al will make your
dentist a rich man"!

09:51.958 --> 09:52.982
What are you --

09:53.059 --> 09:53.992
Oh, right! Sorry.

09:54.060 --> 09:56.962
You tell me your old man
is Brock Samson.

09:57.029 --> 09:59.260
You think I'm gonna
let that slide? Huh?!

09:59.332 --> 10:01.324
I did some checking, and your
facts ain't adding up.

10:01.400 --> 10:02.527
Samson's a ringer.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.332
Well, that's what my freakin'
mom told me, you douche.

10:04.403 --> 10:07.134
Now let me go.
I got to get back to work.

10:07.206 --> 10:09.072
Come on, Hank.
He's a kid.

10:09.141 --> 10:10.200
Don't make me hit a kid.

10:10.276 --> 10:11.835
Oh, yeah, like
I'd even feel it.

10:11.911 --> 10:14.005

My mom gave me this,
all right?

10:22.088 --> 10:23.579
She said it was my dad's.

10:23.656 --> 10:25.591
Okay?
I'm telling you the truth.

10:25.658 --> 10:27.524
Now I got to get back to work
before I get fired.

10:27.593 --> 10:28.993
[sniffles ]
I'm not crying.

10:29.061 --> 10:30.324
He's telling the truth.

10:30.396 --> 10:31.887
Al, go get the boiler.

10:31.964 --> 10:34.729
No clue.
Car? Is that the car?

10:34.800 --> 10:35.859
Yeah, the car.

10:37.903 --> 10:40.805
I am <i>way</i> sorry for making
a grown-up punch you, man.

10:40.873 --> 10:42.273
What?
That's cool.

10:42.341 --> 10:44.003
You know, I actually stole
those video games,

10:44.076 --> 10:45.135
so I had it coming.

10:52.418 --> 10:53.477
Hey, boss.

10:53.552 --> 10:54.781
What can I get you?

10:54.854 --> 10:57.016
I see you made some
changes to my joint.

10:57.089 --> 10:59.854
I got to tell you, it's
always been my secret dream

10:59.925 --> 11:01.325
to run a hash house.

11:01.394 --> 11:03.056
I am just loving this!

11:03.129 --> 11:05.462
Oh, and I made some adjustments
to the menu.

11:05.531 --> 11:08.592
So, basically, we, uh, just
serve eggs now.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.193
Mostly scrambled.

11:10.269 --> 11:11.464
And all with ketchup.

11:11.537 --> 11:13.301
So, what can I get you?

11:13.372 --> 11:15.364
- Cup of java?
- Two.

11:15.441 --> 11:17.808
Gotcha.
Two coffees coming up!

11:17.877 --> 11:18.867
Psst!

11:18.944 --> 11:19.912
Hank.

11:19.979 --> 11:21.811
Psst! Hank.
Hank.

11:21.881 --> 11:24.316
Heard you're working
the Fictel case.

11:24.383 --> 11:26.375
Yeah, Dermott Fictel.
He misses his old man.

11:26.452 --> 11:28.648
Fingered Samson, but it's
starting to get rotten.

11:28.721 --> 11:30.713
So you've met Nikki?
Nikki Fictel?

11:30.790 --> 11:31.655
And how.

11:31.724 --> 11:33.283
Yeah, she's a looker,
that one.

11:33.359 --> 11:34.884
Gams straight up to heaven.

11:34.960 --> 11:36.895
Great, now you're doing
the voice, too, huh?

11:36.962 --> 11:38.521
Don't ruin this
for me, Al!

11:38.597 --> 11:40.395
I've been eating eggs
and ketchup all day

11:40.466 --> 11:41.399
waiting to do this!

11:41.467 --> 11:42.594
All right, sorry!

11:42.668 --> 11:44.364
I mean,
who am I to talk, right?

11:44.437 --> 11:48.101
So, what's your angle
on the Fictel doll?

11:48.174 --> 11:49.733
Nikki moves
antiques.

11:49.809 --> 11:51.675
I've done some
hefty exchanges with her.

11:51.744 --> 11:53.474
She's a pretty big deal
in that racket.

11:53.546 --> 11:56.380
She has some, let's say,
desirable merchandise.

11:56.449 --> 11:58.384
- She running a grift?
- It's on the up-and-up.

11:58.451 --> 12:00.818
But in my circle,
when you can't find something,

12:00.886 --> 12:02.616
and you got
a fistful of hot cabbage,

12:02.688 --> 12:04.384
you dial Nikki Fictel.
You get my mean?

12:04.457 --> 12:06.858
No. I can barely
understand Hank,

12:06.926 --> 12:08.258
and you do it
with a speech impediment.

12:08.327 --> 12:09.260
Listen to me!

12:09.328 --> 12:11.229
I'm risking my life
just talking to you.

12:11.297 --> 12:15.359

that doll knows something.

with the old dame.

12:28.514 --> 12:29.777
Dermott insists that he did,

12:29.849 --> 12:32.182
then coughs up an old key
to my front door.

12:32.251 --> 12:33.583
Billy tells me
to look at Nikki.

12:33.652 --> 12:36.053
Like he needs to tell me
to look at Nikki.

my noodle so full of perfume,

12:39.258 --> 12:41.693
I can hardly tell I haven't
washed this shirt

12:41.761 --> 12:43.286
since I took this miserable
case.

12:43.362 --> 12:46.855
It's time
I made a house call.

12:46.932 --> 12:48.525
[ humming ]

12:48.601 --> 12:49.762
Let me ask you a question.

12:49.835 --> 12:50.894
Sure.

12:50.970 --> 12:52.199
It's the, uh...

12:52.271 --> 12:53.637
"Bewitched" question.

12:53.706 --> 12:54.639
Oh, yes.

12:54.707 --> 12:57.404
Why didn't Darrin let Samantha
just make them magically rich

12:57.476 --> 12:59.377
so he wouldn't have to be
a workaday whipping boy?

12:59.445 --> 13:01.141
Yeah.
Where do you stand on that one?

13:01.213 --> 13:03.580
I can't make you rich, Al.

13:03.649 --> 13:04.810
I don't want that.

13:04.884 --> 13:06.045
It's just that...

13:06.118 --> 13:08.849
You know how I can tell
if people are telling the truth.

13:08.921 --> 13:09.980
It's one of my gifts.

13:10.055 --> 13:11.614
Hank has this case --

13:11.690 --> 13:13.625
I've noticed you've been, uh...

13:13.692 --> 13:15.388
palling around
with the young lad.

13:15.461 --> 13:17.259
That kid knows
how to have fun, Orpheus.

13:17.329 --> 13:18.991
You could learn
something from him.

13:19.064 --> 13:21.795
Anyways, in this case
we got going,

13:21.867 --> 13:24.496
everyone is telling the truth
and none of it adds up.

13:24.570 --> 13:26.232
I -- I kind of want
to help him.

13:26.305 --> 13:28.171
Well, we have these powers.

13:28.240 --> 13:30.141
They are a part of us,
and we should never

13:30.209 --> 13:33.077
be ashamed or afraid
to use them for good.

13:33.145 --> 13:33.976
So you'd, uh...

13:34.046 --> 13:35.344
I would make
Darrin filthy rich,

13:35.414 --> 13:37.144
turn Mr. Tate into a donkey,

13:37.216 --> 13:39.117
tell Endora to get a life,

13:39.185 --> 13:40.813
and blind that nosey
Mrs. Kravitz!

Excellent!
Okay, I need your help.

14:00.706 --> 14:02.072

at the Big Bargains

14:04.844 --> 14:05.812
and wanted to apologize.

14:05.878 --> 14:07.437
You're so sweet.

14:07.513 --> 14:09.448
You want to come in?

crap.

14:12.418 --> 14:13.579

14:13.652 --> 14:16.383
I was a huge fan
when I was a kid.

14:16.455 --> 14:17.923
- Not the hat.
- Sorry.

14:17.990 --> 14:19.117
Is that your good-luck hat?

14:19.191 --> 14:21.854

of all this kind of stuff.

I'll tell you, doll,
old Thaddeus Venture

didn't have the savvy to save
any of them doohickeys.

14:28.834 --> 14:29.699
Well, that's ironic.

14:29.768 --> 14:30.599
That's Rusty.

14:30.669 --> 14:32.535
You remind me
so much of him.

14:32.605 --> 14:33.538
You daffy?

14:33.606 --> 14:34.869
Dean's just like my old man.

of the Venture flock.

I'm trouble.

14:38.010 --> 14:41.378
No, I mean you're like Rusty
from the cartoon.

14:41.447 --> 14:44.007
Your dad's a scared little
has-been,

14:44.083 --> 14:46.382
but you are just like the <i>real</i>

14:46.452 --> 14:47.317
So cool.

and -- and powerful

of a young man.

Sounds like you're trying
to seduce me.

- Nothing.

14:59.231 --> 15:00.790
Well, I -- [ chuckles ]

15:00.866 --> 15:03.563
I guess I'm hiding
a huge crush on you.

15:03.636 --> 15:05.764
I don't get involved
with my clients. Ahem.

15:05.838 --> 15:08.239
I thought you just came here
to bring me flowers.

Oh, relax, Orpheus.
It was funny.

15:33.065 --> 15:34.328
It'll still work.

15:34.400 --> 15:35.800
Geez.

15:35.868 --> 15:37.962
Nikki, you can't
raise a child!

15:38.037 --> 15:39.232
What were you thinking?

15:39.305 --> 15:40.500
Were you even thinking?!

15:40.572 --> 15:41.505
Mom, please!

15:41.573 --> 15:42.597
I want to keep it!

15:42.675 --> 15:44.007
You're still in school!

15:44.076 --> 15:45.669
You're still a child yourself!

15:45.744 --> 15:46.939
What is your problem?!

15:47.012 --> 15:47.877
She's 15!

15:47.947 --> 15:49.472
Did you expect me
to card her?

15:49.548 --> 15:50.607
She said she was 20!

15:50.683 --> 15:51.673
Look, she came on to me.

15:51.750 --> 15:53.719
Things got out of hand.
I'm not proud of this.

15:53.786 --> 15:54.754
Oh, you're not proud?

15:54.820 --> 15:56.914
You fucked the president
of your fan club!

15:56.989 --> 15:58.582
That must have been
a real challenge!

15:58.657 --> 16:00.455
A 15-year-old girl
who worshiped you!

16:00.526 --> 16:02.358
You should be proud,
you fucking asshole!

16:02.428 --> 16:03.987
Look, I'll pay you
whatever you want.

16:04.063 --> 16:06.692
Oh, you'll pay!
Oh, hell, yes, you'll pay!

16:06.765 --> 16:09.667
You live in that huge mansion
with your fancy jet planes!

16:09.735 --> 16:10.896
Oh, you'll pay!

16:10.970 --> 16:12.836
And you will never see this girl
or her baby ever again!

16:12.905 --> 16:14.669
Mom! Please!

16:14.740 --> 16:16.800
Well, I think that's a decision
Nikki and I need to make.

16:16.875 --> 16:18.639
Nikki, take this, and you we'll
work this out together.

16:18.711 --> 16:20.475
Wrong!
She is 15!

16:20.546 --> 16:21.878
That's statutory rape.

16:21.947 --> 16:25.281
You want me to call the cops
and have this settled publicly,

16:25.351 --> 16:27.149
or do you want to crawl back
to your mansion,

16:27.219 --> 16:29.085
write us a check,
and forget about all this?

16:29.154 --> 16:33.683
Nickels...
I'm so sorry.

16:33.759 --> 16:35.955
No!
Don't go!

16:36.028 --> 16:37.496
Sweetie...

16:37.563 --> 16:40.192
Sweetie, he is not worth it.

16:40.265 --> 16:41.995
We'll have the baby
if you want.

16:42.067 --> 16:43.501
I'll raise it as mine.

16:43.569 --> 16:45.128
We're gonna make it work.

16:45.204 --> 16:47.173
I promise you.
All right?

16:47.239 --> 16:49.470
We're gonna be okay.

16:49.541 --> 16:51.339
We're gonna be okay.

16:51.410 --> 16:52.742
Dyah!

16:52.811 --> 16:53.870
Wow!

16:53.946 --> 16:54.777
Just...wow!

16:57.016 --> 17:00.009
I see why Samantha stayed out
of Darrin's business now.

17:00.085 --> 17:03.078
I so did not need
to see that.

17:05.790 --> 17:07.349
I'm off the case.

17:07.425 --> 17:09.588
You and me both, partner.

17:09.661 --> 17:12.858
Yeah, I slipped over to that
dame's joint to question her...

17:12.931 --> 17:14.194
and things got hot.

17:14.266 --> 17:15.097
What did she say?

17:15.166 --> 17:16.657
Say?
Nothing.

17:16.734 --> 17:19.432
But she did things to me that
I didn't think were possible.

17:19.505 --> 17:21.201
That looker ran me
through the yard

17:21.272 --> 17:22.297
and lammed off
with my ticker.

17:22.374 --> 17:24.468
Hank, take off
your detective hat

17:24.542 --> 17:26.704
and tell me what happened!

17:26.779 --> 17:29.339
I had sex!

17:29.415 --> 17:30.747
I had sex with a woman!

17:30.816 --> 17:33.479
And -- and nothing will ever
be the same.

17:33.552 --> 17:34.645
Because of sex.

17:34.720 --> 17:36.245
You don't know
the half of it.

17:36.321 --> 17:37.812
And I have you to thank.

17:37.890 --> 17:39.859
And Dermott's
super-hot sister,

17:39.925 --> 17:41.518
and this old key and --

17:41.593 --> 17:42.993
Hank? Hank?!

17:43.062 --> 17:45.156
We never discharged the spell!

17:45.230 --> 17:47.756
Hank!

17:47.833 --> 17:48.994
Okay.

17:49.068 --> 17:49.899
That's...

17:49.968 --> 17:51.061
I didn't need to know that.

17:51.136 --> 17:53.571
I am so sorry you
just saw that!

17:53.639 --> 17:55.164
I'm gonna vomit.

17:55.240 --> 17:56.640
Al, Al, I'm gonna vomit.

17:56.708 --> 17:57.903
Here, use your hat.

17:57.976 --> 18:00.912
I'm pretty sure
it started all this.

18:00.979 --> 18:03.175
Are you sure this is
the only answer?

18:03.248 --> 18:06.116
I mean, can't you take away
everything

18:06.185 --> 18:07.175
but the part
when I had sex?

18:07.252 --> 18:08.345
Ah, it doesn't work
like that.

18:08.420 --> 18:10.514
It just shaves away
your last memory patterns.

18:10.589 --> 18:13.218
You can't select
what you want to save,

18:13.292 --> 18:14.225
just how far back
you want to forget.

18:14.293 --> 18:15.192
Sorry, tiger.

18:15.260 --> 18:19.197
Maybe I can live with sleeping
with my dad's old girlfriend

18:19.264 --> 18:21.028
and that Dermott is my
half-brother, and --

18:21.100 --> 18:21.965
No, no, no!

18:22.034 --> 18:23.127
All right, enough!

18:23.202 --> 18:24.170
I swear,
if I hear any more,

18:24.236 --> 18:25.864
I'll want to get
in the damn thing.

18:25.938 --> 18:26.928
Hank, it's cool.

18:27.005 --> 18:28.871
You've done this before,
like... a lot.

18:28.941 --> 18:30.773
Really?
I don't remember.

18:30.843 --> 18:32.675
Bingo.
You'll be fine.

18:32.744 --> 18:36.272
Sometimes there are things we
just were never meant to know.

18:36.348 --> 18:39.045
Okay already!
I get it.

18:39.118 --> 18:40.746
I've apologized enough.

18:40.819 --> 18:42.310
And I'm getting in next

18:42.387 --> 18:44.356
because I've seen this whole
Sphinx deal.

18:44.423 --> 18:45.686
Uh, this is the second time

18:45.757 --> 18:47.623
you've seen this machine,
big boy.

18:47.693 --> 18:48.661
[gasps ]

18:48.727 --> 18:50.389
You and I?

18:50.462 --> 18:52.226
And you let me erase that?!

18:52.297 --> 18:53.321
You got a little possessive.

18:53.398 --> 18:55.731
I mean, you dumped
your boyfriend

18:55.801 --> 18:56.632
and tried to move in with me.

18:56.702 --> 18:58.261
I dumped him?

18:58.337 --> 18:59.635
I thought he dumped me.

18:59.705 --> 19:01.367
And you will again
after Hank's done.

19:01.440 --> 19:02.965
Hank, you ready?

19:03.041 --> 19:05.067
Wait, just --
just one more thing.

19:05.144 --> 19:06.077
What?

19:06.145 --> 19:09.081
I got laid!

19:09.148 --> 19:11.014
You sure did, Hank.

19:11.083 --> 19:13.075
You sure did.

19:42.548 --> 19:43.607
Guess what.

19:43.682 --> 19:44.911
I had sex!

19:44.983 --> 19:46.781
Ta-da!

19:46.852 --> 19:47.945
What was it like?

19:48.020 --> 19:51.047
Okay, it's kind of like
naked skydiving

19:51.123 --> 19:53.058
into a mountain
of warm whipped cream.

19:53.125 --> 19:54.753
Yes, that good!

19:54.826 --> 19:55.816
I know!

19:55.894 --> 19:57.021
You don't believe me.

19:57.095 --> 19:58.119
But you have to!

19:58.197 --> 19:59.722
Because I'm yesterday you!

19:59.798 --> 20:02.324
That's how I knew you'd watch
this message immediately

20:02.401 --> 20:04.165
if it was labeled
"Dean face plant."

20:04.236 --> 20:05.727
- That was a good move.
- Thank you.

20:05.804 --> 20:07.295
But, dude, I got
to make this quick.

20:07.372 --> 20:09.398
I'm about to get
my memory wiped.

20:09.474 --> 20:10.464
Aw, gyp!

20:10.542 --> 20:12.204
I knew you'd say that,
but trust me...

20:12.277 --> 20:13.905
I mean, you are me,
so you trust me,

20:13.979 --> 20:16.073
but believe me --
you learned

20:16.148 --> 20:18.617
a whole bunch of other things
you don't really want.

20:18.684 --> 20:20.676
But the part
where we lost our virginity

20:20.752 --> 20:21.583
I needed to remember.

20:21.653 --> 20:23.087
That is so cool.

20:23.155 --> 20:25.249
You have no idea!

20:25.324 --> 20:26.622
I mean,
you did have an idea,

20:26.692 --> 20:28.126
but now you don't.

20:28.193 --> 20:29.058
What?

20:29.127 --> 20:30.254
Yeah, I'm ready!

20:30.329 --> 20:31.194
Oh, yeah.

20:31.263 --> 20:33.357
And this is very important.

with me.

Coming!

20:41.273 --> 20:42.866
Hey.

20:42.941 --> 20:44.432
How was your summer?

20:44.509 --> 20:46.808
Well, I think
I may have watched

20:46.878 --> 20:48.938
my career in super-science
go up in smoke.

20:49.014 --> 20:52.473
But I may have managed to pull
my dreams from the ashes.

20:52.551 --> 20:53.541
How was yours?

20:53.619 --> 20:57.386
Well, from what I hear,
it was amazing.

20:57.456 --> 20:58.389
Have you seen Pop?

20:58.457 --> 21:00.483
He left New York without even
saying goodbye.
