00:07.090 --> 00:09.134
I had a bad dream.

00:09.176 --> 00:11.052
It's okay, sweetie.

00:11.094 --> 00:12.554
Here, come on.

00:12.596 --> 00:13.764
Come on.

00:13.806 --> 00:16.057
It's okay now.

00:16.099 --> 00:19.561
(yawning):

00:16.099 --> 00:19.561
What was your dream?

00:19.603 --> 00:21.104
I dreamed...

00:21.146 --> 00:26.527
there was this man...

00:21.146 --> 00:26.527
outside the door

00:26.568 --> 00:29.070
with a big knife...

00:29.112 --> 00:32.157
and he wanted

00:29.112 --> 00:32.157
to tie everyone up...

00:32.199 --> 00:34.075
and kill them...

00:34.117 --> 00:37.705
and eat their eyeballs.

00:37.746 --> 00:39.206
Good night.

01:20.414 --> 01:21.957
Hey. What you doing

01:20.414 --> 01:21.957
there, son?

01:21.999 --> 01:24.418
I have to prove Kepler's

01:21.999 --> 01:24.418
third law of planetary motion.

01:25.753 --> 01:27.963
What's Dewey doing?

01:25.753 --> 01:27.963
He's coloring.

01:28.005 --> 01:30.424
Well, I'd better get

01:28.005 --> 01:30.424
in there.

01:30.465 --> 01:32.760
Dad, there's this crazy guy

01:30.465 --> 01:32.760
chasing me.

01:32.801 --> 01:34.302
He's saying I did

01:32.801 --> 01:34.302
some horrible things,

01:34.344 --> 01:35.804
but I couldn't

01:34.344 --> 01:35.804
really understand him.

01:35.846 --> 01:37.598
I think he's an escapee

01:35.846 --> 01:37.598
from the mental hospital.

01:37.639 --> 01:38.599
(knock at door)

01:38.640 --> 01:39.516
I didn't hear anything.

01:39.558 --> 01:41.393
(groans)

01:44.438 --> 01:46.105
Hello again, Hal.

01:47.900 --> 01:50.069
You are not to step foot

01:47.900 --> 01:50.069
outside of this house

01:50.110 --> 01:52.071
except for school

01:50.110 --> 01:52.071
for the next month!

01:52.112 --> 01:54.155
Okay.

01:52.112 --> 01:54.155
Wait a minute, honey,

01:52.112 --> 01:54.155
he has to go outside.

01:54.197 --> 01:56.075
He's not done pulling weeds

01:54.197 --> 01:56.075
from his last punishment.

01:56.116 --> 01:57.659
Oh, I think staying inside

01:56.116 --> 01:57.659
with no TV

01:57.701 --> 01:58.994
is worse than weeding.

01:59.036 --> 02:00.161
I'm already banned from TV.

02:00.203 --> 02:00.996
You are?

02:01.038 --> 02:02.581
All right. Fine.

02:02.623 --> 02:05.876
No TV, no going outside

02:02.623 --> 02:05.876
except for weeding,

02:05.918 --> 02:07.962
which you'll do at night.

02:08.003 --> 02:09.630
Inside.

02:09.671 --> 02:11.423
Oh, I got nothing.

02:11.465 --> 02:12.549
How long is this going to take?

02:12.591 --> 02:14.217
Oh, look, just...

02:12.591 --> 02:14.217
go to your room!

02:12.591 --> 02:14.217
Oh, you...

02:14.259 --> 02:16.177
Your father and I

02:14.259 --> 02:16.177
will sort this out.

02:16.219 --> 02:17.429
Okay.

02:17.471 --> 02:19.640
We are not

02:17.471 --> 02:19.640
getting through to him.

02:19.681 --> 02:21.224
Well, what else

02:19.681 --> 02:21.224
can we do?

02:21.266 --> 02:24.185
We-We've taken away

02:21.266 --> 02:24.185
television, video games,

02:24.227 --> 02:25.562
his music, fresh air.

02:25.604 --> 02:27.230
Lois, we have taken away

02:25.604 --> 02:27.230
his air,

02:27.272 --> 02:29.190
and he doesn't care

02:27.272 --> 02:29.190
about any of it.

02:29.232 --> 02:30.985
Well, we had better

02:29.232 --> 02:30.985
come up with something

02:31.026 --> 02:33.654
before he winds up being

02:31.026 --> 02:33.654
a problem for the state.

02:33.695 --> 02:35.864
I don't know,

02:33.695 --> 02:35.864
maybe we should try something

02:35.906 --> 02:37.032
other than punishing him.

02:37.074 --> 02:38.117
Like what?

02:38.158 --> 02:40.035
Maybe Reese needs

02:38.158 --> 02:40.035
more attention.

02:40.077 --> 02:41.202
Positive attention.

02:41.244 --> 02:42.621
When I was his age

02:42.663 --> 02:44.873
I always wanted

02:42.663 --> 02:44.873
someone there to talk to,

02:44.915 --> 02:46.000
to hang out with,

02:46.041 --> 02:47.208
be a role model.

02:47.250 --> 02:48.502
Oh, Hal, I don't know.

02:48.543 --> 02:50.921
Lois, that boy needs

02:48.543 --> 02:50.921
a father figure,

02:50.963 --> 02:53.172
and I really think

02:50.963 --> 02:53.172
it should be me.

02:54.967 --> 02:56.677
What is Cynthia doing?

02:56.718 --> 02:58.012
We thought

02:56.718 --> 02:58.012
you would know,

02:58.053 --> 02:59.304
given your relationship.

02:59.346 --> 03:01.515
We don't have a relationship.

03:01.556 --> 03:05.602
It's okay... to feel.

03:05.644 --> 03:06.520
Shut up.

03:06.561 --> 03:07.646
Hey, guys.

03:07.688 --> 03:08.897
Here you go.

03:08.939 --> 03:11.150
I'm having a party this weekend.

03:11.190 --> 03:12.693
Don't lose

03:11.190 --> 03:12.693
those invitations

03:12.734 --> 03:15.236
'cause no one gets past my dad

03:12.734 --> 03:15.236
without them.

03:15.278 --> 03:17.238
A party.

03:17.280 --> 03:21.242
An actual, non-self-delusional-

03:17.280 --> 03:21.242
figment-of-my-imagination party.

03:21.284 --> 03:22.410
Is it your birthday?

03:22.452 --> 03:23.954
No, it's just

03:22.452 --> 03:23.954
for socializing.

03:23.996 --> 03:25.039
You know, it's weird.

03:25.080 --> 03:26.623
I've been here

03:25.080 --> 03:26.623
for a month and a half,

03:26.665 --> 03:28.709
and you guys

03:26.665 --> 03:28.709
are the only friends I have.

03:28.750 --> 03:30.044
You're kidding.

03:30.085 --> 03:31.128
I'm serious.

03:31.170 --> 03:33.254
It may be hard

03:31.170 --> 03:33.254
for you guys to believe,

03:33.296 --> 03:35.132
but some people have trouble

03:35.174 --> 03:37.258
making friends.

03:40.679 --> 03:43.264
Cynthia, are you sure

03:40.679 --> 03:43.264
you want to sound so...?

03:43.306 --> 03:44.641
Man, I wish I'd thought of this.

03:44.683 --> 03:46.101
I know!

03:46.143 --> 03:47.728
It's going

03:46.143 --> 03:47.728
to be so great.

03:47.769 --> 03:49.437
I'm finally going

03:47.769 --> 03:49.437
to make some friends.

03:49.479 --> 03:51.190
What do you think,

03:49.479 --> 03:51.190
Malcolm?

03:51.231 --> 03:52.273
It sounds great.

03:52.315 --> 03:53.274
It should be a...

03:53.316 --> 03:54.484
party.

03:54.526 --> 03:55.777
Fingers crossed.

03:55.819 --> 03:56.987
Yeah.

03:57.029 --> 03:58.238
All right.

03:59.198 --> 04:00.240
Hey, Eric, how's it going?

04:01.575 --> 04:04.703
You just missed your third

04:01.575 --> 04:04.703
history deadline, Francis.

04:04.745 --> 04:07.956
I am not going to

04:04.745 --> 04:07.956
Spangler's summer school

04:07.998 --> 04:10.542
because my partner blew

04:07.998 --> 04:10.542
off his half of the project.

04:10.584 --> 04:11.919
Didn't you get my half?

04:11.960 --> 04:13.545
I slipped it under your door.

04:13.587 --> 04:15.089
This  is your half?

04:15.130 --> 04:15.714
Yeah.

04:15.756 --> 04:18.383
This is my half!

04:18.425 --> 04:20.802
Well, if I knew you were going

04:18.425 --> 04:20.802
to go so overboard,

04:20.844 --> 04:23.972
I would have spent

04:20.844 --> 04:23.972
a little more time

04:20.844 --> 04:23.972
on my section.

04:24.014 --> 04:26.767
You photocopied a page

04:24.014 --> 04:26.767
out of the dictionary.

04:26.808 --> 04:28.185
Okay.

04:28.227 --> 04:29.310
I messed up.

04:29.352 --> 04:30.353
There's still time.

04:30.395 --> 04:32.231
When's this thing due, again?

04:32.313 --> 04:33.190
The 20th.

04:33.232 --> 04:34.399
And you're worried?

04:34.441 --> 04:36.193
We have over a week.

04:36.235 --> 04:37.736
My half took me two months.

04:37.778 --> 04:39.821
Okay, I guess I'm

04:37.778 --> 04:39.821
just going to have

04:37.778 --> 04:39.821
to buckle down

04:39.863 --> 04:40.822
and get it done, then.

04:40.864 --> 04:42.116
All right.

04:42.157 --> 04:43.951
I'll go to the library

04:42.157 --> 04:43.951
and get some books.

04:43.992 --> 04:45.827
You stay here

04:43.992 --> 04:45.827
and organize your notes.

04:45.869 --> 04:47.621
Sounds like a plan.

04:53.376 --> 04:55.336
68 degrees.

04:55.378 --> 04:57.798
Perfect paper-writing

04:55.378 --> 04:57.798
temperature.

04:57.839 --> 04:59.716
Let's get to it.

04:59.758 --> 05:02.552
I thought you said

04:59.758 --> 05:02.552
we were trying

04:59.758 --> 05:02.552
something new.

05:02.594 --> 05:03.804
That's right, we are.

05:03.845 --> 05:05.430
So this  isn't

05:03.845 --> 05:05.430
a punishment?

05:05.472 --> 05:07.224
No. Why

05:05.472 --> 05:07.224
would you say that?

05:07.266 --> 05:10.018
'Cause you keep

05:07.266 --> 05:10.018
looking at me

05:07.266 --> 05:10.018
and saying stuff.

05:10.060 --> 05:11.603
I am paying attention

05:10.060 --> 05:11.603
to you.

05:11.645 --> 05:13.396
But, Dad, a cooking class?

05:13.438 --> 05:14.606
Come on, Reese,

05:13.438 --> 05:14.606
open your mind.

05:14.648 --> 05:16.733
The art of cooking

05:14.648 --> 05:16.733
is as masculine

05:16.775 --> 05:18.443
as any of

05:16.775 --> 05:18.443
these other courses--

05:18.485 --> 05:20.237
judo, riflery, kickboxing.

05:20.279 --> 05:22.823
Anyone can fight,

05:20.279 --> 05:22.823
but it takes a special man

05:22.864 --> 05:26.160
to craft a truly great

05:22.864 --> 05:26.160
Bolognese sauce.

05:26.201 --> 05:29.037
I still feel like

05:26.201 --> 05:29.037
I'm in trouble.

05:40.215 --> 05:41.883
Hi, I'm Cynthia.

05:41.925 --> 05:44.385
We don't know each other,

05:41.925 --> 05:44.385
but I'm having a party.

05:44.427 --> 05:46.429
See how it says,

05:44.427 --> 05:46.429
"8:00 till ?"

05:46.471 --> 05:49.266
That means it

05:46.471 --> 05:49.266
could go on

05:46.471 --> 05:49.266
ad infinitum.

05:49.308 --> 05:50.225
(giggles)

05:50.267 --> 05:52.393
See you there.

05:52.435 --> 05:53.394
Hi, I'm Cynthia.

05:53.436 --> 05:54.896
We don't know

05:53.436 --> 05:54.896
each other, but...

05:54.938 --> 05:57.107
What is she doing,

05:54.938 --> 05:57.107
inviting the whole school?

05:57.149 --> 05:58.817
I'm sorry. I can't

05:57.149 --> 05:58.817
talk right now.

05:58.859 --> 06:01.820
I'm saving all my good

05:58.859 --> 06:01.820
conversation for the party.

06:01.862 --> 06:03.780
For instance, there's

06:01.862 --> 06:03.780
an interesting piece

06:01.862 --> 06:03.780
in this month's

06:03.822 --> 06:05.657
New England Journal

06:03.822 --> 06:05.657
of Medicine.

06:05.699 --> 06:07.659
Hey, that's  my  anecdote.

06:07.701 --> 06:09.452
I hope...

06:09.494 --> 06:14.415
my wheelchair... fits in the...

06:14.457 --> 06:16.043
make-out closet.

06:16.084 --> 06:17.336
I hope you come

06:16.084 --> 06:17.336
with an appetite.

06:17.376 --> 06:19.587
I'm serving cookies

06:17.376 --> 06:19.587
shaped like famous

06:19.629 --> 06:21.422
Communist revolutionaries.

06:21.464 --> 06:23.424
Hi, I'm Cynthia...

06:23.466 --> 06:25.844
Uh... Cynthia, can I talk to you

06:23.466 --> 06:25.844
for a second?

06:25.886 --> 06:26.845
Sure.

06:26.887 --> 06:28.513
Tell all your friends!

06:28.555 --> 06:31.432
How many people are you

06:28.555 --> 06:31.432
inviting to your party?

06:31.474 --> 06:32.433
God, who knows?

06:32.475 --> 06:34.519
I left a stack of invitations

06:32.475 --> 06:34.519
at the library

06:34.561 --> 06:36.104
and a stack at the arcade.

06:36.146 --> 06:38.439
I figure people will

06:36.146 --> 06:38.439
appreciate the personal touch.

06:38.481 --> 06:40.441
You know, so they can match

06:38.481 --> 06:40.441
a face with a face.

06:40.483 --> 06:42.152
(laughs)

06:42.194 --> 06:43.904
Don't you think you're

06:42.194 --> 06:43.904
kind of overreaching?

06:43.945 --> 06:45.446
What are you talking about?

06:45.488 --> 06:46.656
I'm afraid you're

06:45.488 --> 06:46.656
setting yourself up

06:46.698 --> 06:48.449
for a giant

06:46.698 --> 06:48.449
disappointment.

06:48.491 --> 06:50.493
I mean, when ten people

06:48.491 --> 06:50.493
don't show up, it's a drag.

06:50.535 --> 06:51.912
When 300 people

06:50.535 --> 06:51.912
don't show up,

06:51.953 --> 06:53.454
it's, like,

06:51.953 --> 06:53.454
total humiliation.

06:53.496 --> 06:55.623
Well, I guess lots of people

06:53.496 --> 06:55.623
will have to show up, then.

06:55.665 --> 06:57.667
Cynthia, you're a Krelboyne.

06:57.709 --> 07:00.461
Krelboynes have

06:57.709 --> 07:00.461
Krelboyne parties.

07:00.503 --> 07:02.756
You don't know how many friends

07:00.503 --> 07:02.756
I'm capable of making.

07:02.797 --> 07:04.299
Yes, I do. Zero.

07:04.341 --> 07:05.508
Just like the rest of us.

07:05.550 --> 07:07.677
Cynthia, no one's

07:05.550 --> 07:07.677
coming to your party.

07:07.719 --> 07:09.096
Oh, yeah?

07:09.137 --> 07:11.306
Well, it so happens

07:09.137 --> 07:11.306
the Kinkos man said

07:11.348 --> 07:13.767
I set a new record

07:11.348 --> 07:13.767
for laminated invitations.

07:13.808 --> 07:16.103
So? That doesn't

07:13.808 --> 07:16.103
mean anything.

07:16.144 --> 07:17.687
I know what this is

07:16.144 --> 07:17.687
all about.

07:17.729 --> 07:18.563
You're jealous.

07:18.605 --> 07:20.481
Jealous?

07:20.523 --> 07:22.943
Making friends obviously

07:20.523 --> 07:22.943
doesn't come easy to you.

07:22.984 --> 07:24.945
So you hide in your

07:22.984 --> 07:24.945
safe little circle

07:24.986 --> 07:26.738
while people like me

07:24.986 --> 07:26.738
throw big parties

07:26.780 --> 07:28.740
and make lots of friends

07:26.780 --> 07:28.740
and enjoy life.

07:29.741 --> 07:32.702
Hmm? Bitter--

07:29.741 --> 07:32.702
what a surprise.

07:34.579 --> 07:37.498
The key to quick chopping is

07:34.579 --> 07:37.498
to rest the blade

07:37.540 --> 07:41.628
against your knuckles

07:37.540 --> 07:41.628
and slowly pull back as we...

07:44.547 --> 07:46.300
Who chopped that?

07:46.341 --> 07:48.218
I-I did it.

07:49.552 --> 07:50.637
Let's see it again.

07:56.559 --> 07:59.020
Oh, my word!

07:59.062 --> 08:00.730
Actually, his slices are

08:00.772 --> 08:02.941
a  little  more uniform

08:00.772 --> 08:02.941
than yours.

08:02.983 --> 08:06.194
And you say you've never cooked

08:02.983 --> 08:06.194
anything before?

08:06.236 --> 08:07.528
Intentionally?

08:07.570 --> 08:08.529
No.

08:08.571 --> 08:10.031
Remarkable.

08:11.574 --> 08:13.910
Sit down

08:11.574 --> 08:13.910
and listen to me!

08:13.952 --> 08:15.620
I am sick of this!

08:15.662 --> 08:16.746
It's been two days

08:16.788 --> 08:18.539
and you haven't done

08:16.788 --> 08:18.539
a lick of work.

08:18.581 --> 08:21.251
And I can't believe I let you

08:18.581 --> 08:21.251
drag me to that movie.

08:21.293 --> 08:22.336
I know.

08:21.293 --> 08:22.336
I'm beginning to question

08:22.377 --> 08:24.545
the whole talking dog genre.

08:24.587 --> 08:27.007
You know what would get our mind

08:24.587 --> 08:27.007
off that movie?

08:27.048 --> 08:28.549
Another round

08:27.048 --> 08:28.549
of miniature golf!

08:28.591 --> 08:29.550
No! No miniature golf.

08:29.592 --> 08:30.969
You have to get to work.

08:31.011 --> 08:31.845
You're right.

08:31.886 --> 08:33.554
When you're right, you're right.

08:33.596 --> 08:34.555
Let's get to it.

08:34.597 --> 08:36.850
These two books are

08:34.597 --> 08:36.850
on the war itself

08:36.891 --> 08:38.852
so you can breeze

08:36.891 --> 08:38.852
through them

08:38.893 --> 08:41.355
'cause your half of the project

08:38.893 --> 08:41.355
is on Reconstruction.

08:41.396 --> 08:43.564
Okay. I have no idea

08:41.396 --> 08:43.564
what you're talking about.

08:43.606 --> 08:44.774
But I will

08:44.816 --> 08:45.859
'cause I'm not leaving this room

08:45.900 --> 08:47.027
for the next ten hours.

08:47.068 --> 08:48.611
That's what I like to hear.

08:48.653 --> 08:51.156
Now, before I go,

08:48.653 --> 08:51.156
do you need  anything?

08:51.198 --> 08:53.492
I don't want you leaving

08:51.198 --> 08:53.492
this room.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.076
No, just stop bothering me.

08:55.118 --> 08:56.536
I'm trying to study.

09:12.427 --> 09:15.596
All right, Harvey, let's see

09:12.427 --> 09:15.596
if you can break Brent's record.

09:15.638 --> 09:17.807
You have to beat an hour

09:15.638 --> 09:17.807
and four minutes.

09:19.642 --> 09:20.310
Go!

09:22.521 --> 09:23.480
Sorry I'm late!

09:23.522 --> 09:24.689
Craig ran off some kids

09:24.731 --> 09:26.900
and needed me to walk him

09:24.731 --> 09:26.900
to his car.

09:26.941 --> 09:29.403
I'll have dinner ready

09:26.941 --> 09:29.403
in just one second.

09:29.444 --> 09:30.653
Shh, shh, shh.

09:30.695 --> 09:32.531
Look.

09:36.659 --> 09:37.869
Well?

09:37.911 --> 09:39.496
It's hot.

09:39.538 --> 09:41.581
And it needs

09:39.538 --> 09:41.581
another bay leaf.

09:43.041 --> 09:44.625
Just look at him.

09:44.667 --> 09:46.503
After tasting

09:44.667 --> 09:46.503
his chocolate soufflé,

09:46.545 --> 09:48.796
the class actually gave him

09:46.545 --> 09:48.796
a standing ovation.

09:48.838 --> 09:50.257
Reese?

09:50.298 --> 09:51.258
Dewey,

09:51.299 --> 09:53.510
are you happy with how

09:51.299 --> 09:53.510
those are julienned?

09:53.552 --> 09:54.677
I think so.

09:54.719 --> 09:56.304
Go check the brioche.

09:57.305 --> 09:58.890
The bread in the oven?

09:58.932 --> 09:59.974
Ah.

10:01.351 --> 10:03.228
Dad, I just wanted

10:01.351 --> 10:03.228
to let you know

10:03.270 --> 10:05.688
how much that cooking

10:03.270 --> 10:05.688
class means to me.

10:05.730 --> 10:07.648
If you hadn't signed

10:05.730 --> 10:07.648
me up for it,

10:07.690 --> 10:10.527
I never would've known

10:07.690 --> 10:10.527
that something so stupid

10:10.569 --> 10:11.736
could be so much fun.

10:13.154 --> 10:14.573
Thanks.

10:16.741 --> 10:20.661
Oh, come on, that's got to make

10:16.741 --> 10:20.661
you feel good.

10:24.291 --> 10:27.461
Aw, look at Malcolm,

10:24.291 --> 10:27.461
surrounded by all his friends.

10:27.502 --> 10:30.130
I wonder what he owes

10:27.502 --> 10:30.130
his social success to?

10:30.171 --> 10:32.340
What do you think,

10:30.171 --> 10:32.340
Invisible Friend Number One?

10:32.382 --> 10:33.674
Leave me alone.

10:33.716 --> 10:35.552
There you go again--

10:33.716 --> 10:35.552
pushing people away.

10:35.594 --> 10:37.596
You know, Malcolm,

10:35.594 --> 10:37.596
if you want to make friends

10:37.637 --> 10:38.846
you have to extend yourself.

10:38.888 --> 10:39.722
Yeah, you're right.

10:39.764 --> 10:41.558
I'm going to work

10:39.764 --> 10:41.558
on that. See ya.

10:41.600 --> 10:42.934
It's sad, really.

10:42.976 --> 10:44.727
I feel sorry for you.

10:44.769 --> 10:45.728
You know what?

10:45.770 --> 10:47.730
I just got

10:45.770 --> 10:47.730
the greatest idea!

10:47.772 --> 10:49.690
It's the perfect way

10:47.772 --> 10:49.690
to break you out

10:49.732 --> 10:51.318
of your self-protective shell.

10:51.359 --> 10:52.319
What are you

10:51.359 --> 10:52.319
talking about?

10:52.360 --> 10:54.695
You're going to cohost

10:52.360 --> 10:54.695
the party with me.

10:54.737 --> 10:55.696
Come on.

10:55.738 --> 10:58.158
Hi, I'm Cynthia

10:55.738 --> 10:58.158
and this is Malcolm.

10:58.199 --> 11:00.868
We're cohosting a party

10:58.199 --> 11:00.868
this weekend...

11:00.910 --> 11:01.869
Let go.

11:01.911 --> 11:03.704
And we have a musical

11:01.911 --> 11:03.704
invitation for you.

11:03.746 --> 11:05.915
♪ You should come 'round

11:03.746 --> 11:05.915
to our party, you'll have fun ♪

11:05.957 --> 11:07.875
♪ You'll have fun ♪

11:07.917 --> 11:10.753
♪ You should come 'round to

11:07.917 --> 11:10.753
our party, you'll have fun... ♪

11:10.795 --> 11:12.547
Okay, you made

11:10.795 --> 11:12.547
me do this.

11:14.966 --> 11:17.718
Can't you think of a better

11:14.966 --> 11:17.718
place to kiss me?

11:17.760 --> 11:19.387
There. Read that.

11:19.429 --> 11:20.721
Malcolm, are you crazy?

11:20.763 --> 11:22.432
Read.

11:23.558 --> 11:25.101
That's the Krelboyne

11:23.558 --> 11:25.101
Wall of Fame.

11:25.143 --> 11:26.894
You can see that you're

11:25.143 --> 11:26.894
pretty well represented.

11:26.936 --> 11:29.648
There's my section

11:26.936 --> 11:29.648
and there's Lloyd's.

11:29.730 --> 11:32.609
But in terms of sheer volume,

11:29.730 --> 11:32.609
you still have us beat.

11:32.651 --> 11:33.734
So do you understand now?

11:33.776 --> 11:36.695
You can't have that party.

11:39.782 --> 11:42.243
But that one there,

11:39.782 --> 11:42.243
that's ridiculous.

11:42.285 --> 11:44.621
No one really believes that

11:42.285 --> 11:44.621
about you.

11:48.208 --> 11:49.376
(door closes)

11:49.417 --> 11:51.378
STEVIE:

11:49.417 --> 11:51.378
Real...

11:51.419 --> 11:53.171
classy.

11:59.886 --> 12:01.346
Hey, you guys

11:59.886 --> 12:01.346
seen Cynthia?

12:01.388 --> 12:03.431
No, but maybe  you

12:01.388 --> 12:03.431
can settle a debate.

12:03.473 --> 12:04.765
Maroon or beige?

12:04.807 --> 12:05.766
What are you guys

12:05.808 --> 12:06.976
talking about?

12:07.018 --> 12:08.936
Duh. Matching turtlenecks

12:07.018 --> 12:08.936
for the party.

12:08.978 --> 12:10.021
CYNTHIA:

12:08.978 --> 12:10.021
Hey, everybody.

12:10.063 --> 12:12.482
Oh, Cynthia,

12:10.063 --> 12:12.482
I wanted to apologize...

12:12.524 --> 12:14.067
Nothing to apologize

12:12.524 --> 12:14.067
for, Malcolm.

12:14.108 --> 12:15.276
Here.

12:15.318 --> 12:16.777
I'm canceling my party.

12:16.819 --> 12:18.655
These are uninvitations.

12:18.697 --> 12:21.491
Don't crowd, there's

12:18.697 --> 12:21.491
one for each of you.

12:21.533 --> 12:23.368
Malcolm opened my

12:21.533 --> 12:23.368
eyes to the fact

12:23.410 --> 12:25.036
that I'm a creepy,

12:23.410 --> 12:25.036
friendless dork

12:25.078 --> 12:26.954
who has no reason

12:25.078 --> 12:26.954
to expect anyone

12:26.996 --> 12:28.039
to come to her party.

12:28.081 --> 12:30.791
You callous bastard!

12:30.833 --> 12:33.712
Cynthia, I didn't want to

12:30.833 --> 12:33.712
tell you like that. I'm sorry.

12:33.752 --> 12:34.713
No need to be sorry.

12:34.753 --> 12:36.172
I should be thanking you.

12:36.214 --> 12:37.716
Thank you, Malcolm.

12:37.756 --> 12:39.676
Cynthia...

12:37.756 --> 12:39.676
You know what?!

12:39.718 --> 12:41.010
There's only

12:39.718 --> 12:41.010
so much crying

12:41.052 --> 12:42.596
I can do in one day,

12:42.637 --> 12:45.806
and just looking at you

12:42.637 --> 12:45.806
makes me want to cry.

12:45.848 --> 12:47.016
So, if you

12:45.848 --> 12:47.016
don't mind,

12:47.058 --> 12:49.143
I'd like to leave you now.

12:52.897 --> 12:56.025
ERIC:

12:52.897 --> 12:56.025
All right, no more

12:52.897 --> 12:56.025
distractions, Francis.

12:56.067 --> 12:58.027
I'm tired of yelling at you.

12:58.069 --> 13:01.239
I'm not saying Harvey's

12:58.069 --> 13:01.239
last heat wasn't exciting...

13:01.281 --> 13:02.532
You didn't have to kill him,

13:01.281 --> 13:02.532
you know.

13:02.574 --> 13:04.825
Yes! Yes, I did.

13:04.867 --> 13:06.035
Now, please,

13:06.077 --> 13:08.538
as a friend, just focus!

13:08.580 --> 13:09.664
I'm sorry.

13:09.706 --> 13:10.915
I know I tend

13:09.706 --> 13:10.915
to procrastinate,

13:10.957 --> 13:13.752
but when a deadline nears,

13:10.957 --> 13:13.752

13:13.792 --> 13:17.338
Okay. I'll check

13:13.792 --> 13:17.338

13:17.380 --> 13:19.633
Uh, you'd better take this.

13:19.674 --> 13:20.717
Why?

13:20.759 --> 13:23.344

13:28.975 --> 13:31.394

14:18.650 --> 14:21.194
I can't believe

14:18.650 --> 14:21.194
I really made this.

14:21.235 --> 14:22.737
You know, Dad,

14:22.779 --> 14:26.324
if you work really hard

14:22.779 --> 14:26.324
at something, it shows.

14:26.366 --> 14:27.908
Yes, son.

14:26.366 --> 14:27.908
Yes, it does.

14:27.950 --> 14:29.910
(chuckling)

14:29.952 --> 14:31.371
Mmm...

14:31.412 --> 14:33.164
Class, during our next session

14:33.206 --> 14:35.375
we'll be holding

14:33.206 --> 14:35.375
a little competition.

14:35.416 --> 14:38.002
Friends and relatives

14:35.416 --> 14:38.002
are encouraged to attend,

14:38.044 --> 14:41.172
and don't be discouraged

14:38.044 --> 14:41.172
if you feel a little outclassed

14:41.214 --> 14:43.591
by some of our

14:41.214 --> 14:43.591
more promising students.

14:43.633 --> 14:45.134
We're all here to have fun.

14:45.176 --> 14:46.511
What do I get if I win?

14:46.553 --> 14:48.012
A six-inch paring knife

14:48.054 --> 14:49.889
and a bread cloche.

14:51.182 --> 14:52.892
Awesome!

14:56.688 --> 14:58.147
May I help you?

14:58.189 --> 14:59.440
Hi. I'm Malcolm.

14:59.482 --> 15:01.359
I don't know if you remember...

15:01.401 --> 15:03.152
I'm not sure.

15:01.401 --> 15:03.152
I have a vague

15:01.401 --> 15:03.152
recollection

15:03.194 --> 15:05.780
of you throwing

15:03.194 --> 15:05.780
a brick through my

15:03.194 --> 15:05.780
daughter's window.

15:05.822 --> 15:07.657
Oh, and I think

15:05.822 --> 15:07.657
you're the kid

15:07.699 --> 15:10.159
who ruined her party

15:07.699 --> 15:10.159
and humiliated her

15:07.699 --> 15:10.159
in a public toilet.

15:10.201 --> 15:11.202
How am I doing?

15:12.453 --> 15:13.621
Now, if you don't mind...

15:13.663 --> 15:15.665
It's okay, Dad.

15:18.710 --> 15:19.960
How's it going?

15:20.002 --> 15:20.961
Oh, great.

15:21.003 --> 15:22.255
The party's a blast.

15:22.296 --> 15:23.840
Can't you hear it

15:22.296 --> 15:23.840
in there?

15:25.425 --> 15:27.051
What are you doing here,

15:25.425 --> 15:27.051
Malcolm?

15:27.093 --> 15:28.636
You won't talk

15:27.093 --> 15:28.636
to me at school

15:28.678 --> 15:30.179
and you won't

15:28.678 --> 15:30.179
return my calls.

15:30.221 --> 15:32.265
I just want to say

15:30.221 --> 15:32.265
again that I'm sorry.

15:32.306 --> 15:33.474
Fine.

15:33.516 --> 15:34.975
You want to alleviate

15:33.516 --> 15:34.975
your guilt?

15:35.017 --> 15:36.977
You are absolved.

15:37.019 --> 15:37.937
Just let me finish.

15:39.313 --> 15:41.065
I'm not sorry that

15:39.313 --> 15:41.065
I told you the truth.

15:41.107 --> 15:42.609
You were just

15:41.107 --> 15:42.609
setting yourself up

15:42.650 --> 15:43.902
for a big disaster tonight

15:43.943 --> 15:45.486
if you went ahead

15:43.943 --> 15:45.486
with your party.

15:45.528 --> 15:48.615
I just wish I was

15:45.528 --> 15:48.615
nicer about it.

15:48.656 --> 15:49.990
What's the nice way

15:48.656 --> 15:49.990
to tell someone

15:50.032 --> 15:51.992
they're a social retard?

15:52.034 --> 15:53.286
So you see my problem.

15:53.327 --> 15:54.788
But what I didn't say

15:54.829 --> 15:56.664
is that even if

15:54.829 --> 15:56.664
you are a dork,

15:56.706 --> 15:57.998
you're also

15:56.706 --> 15:57.998
smart and funny

15:58.040 --> 15:59.208
and interesting and kind

15:59.250 --> 16:00.460
and a totally

15:59.250 --> 16:00.460
unique person,

16:00.501 --> 16:01.920
and if other people

16:00.501 --> 16:01.920
can't see that,

16:01.961 --> 16:02.962
that's  their  problem.

16:05.673 --> 16:08.593
So, how'd you learn

16:05.673 --> 16:08.593
to deal with the whole school

16:08.635 --> 16:10.010
making fun of you?

16:10.052 --> 16:11.638
The same way I deal

16:10.052 --> 16:11.638
with everything:

16:11.679 --> 16:13.055
I pretend it

16:11.679 --> 16:13.055
doesn't bother me

16:13.097 --> 16:14.599
and then lash

16:13.097 --> 16:14.599
out on people

16:14.641 --> 16:16.016
who don't deserve it.

16:16.058 --> 16:17.017
It seems to work.

16:17.059 --> 16:18.436
Do you want to come in?

16:20.772 --> 16:22.816
BOY:

16:20.772 --> 16:22.816
Hey!

16:22.857 --> 16:24.108
Can I help you?

16:24.150 --> 16:25.944
Yeah. We're here

16:24.150 --> 16:25.944
for Cynthia's party.

16:25.985 --> 16:27.487
We found these things

16:25.985 --> 16:27.487
in the library.

16:27.528 --> 16:28.863
Uh...

16:28.905 --> 16:31.031
I thought

16:28.905 --> 16:31.031
you handed out

16:28.905 --> 16:31.031
uninvitations.

16:31.073 --> 16:33.033
I thought you said

16:31.073 --> 16:33.033
no one would come.

16:33.075 --> 16:35.787
Come on in...

16:33.075 --> 16:35.787
I guess.

16:45.338 --> 16:47.047
I think he's actually

16:45.338 --> 16:47.047
going to win.

16:47.089 --> 16:49.300
I just hope we get

16:47.089 --> 16:49.300
to taste whatever

16:47.089 --> 16:49.300
it is he's cooking.

16:49.342 --> 16:50.593
(Dewey yelling)

16:57.558 --> 17:00.645
Reese, this is

16:57.558 --> 17:00.645
the best spinach quiche

16:57.558 --> 17:00.645
I've ever tasted.

17:00.687 --> 17:02.522
What gives it

17:00.687 --> 17:02.522
that extra something?

17:02.563 --> 17:05.065
I put some allspice

17:02.563 --> 17:05.065
on the pine nuts before

17:02.563 --> 17:05.065
I toasted them.

17:05.107 --> 17:06.108
Allspice.

17:05.107 --> 17:06.108
Yeah,

17:06.150 --> 17:08.528
it just seemed like it would

17:06.150 --> 17:08.528
balance out the ricotta.

17:08.569 --> 17:10.029
How extraordinary.

17:16.536 --> 17:19.079
How much salt

17:16.536 --> 17:19.079
did you use?

17:19.121 --> 17:20.331
Just a pinch.

17:22.834 --> 17:25.378
I did not put all

17:22.834 --> 17:25.378
of this salt in there.

17:26.546 --> 17:28.130
Where do you keep

17:26.546 --> 17:28.130
your first aid kit?

17:28.172 --> 17:31.009
My husband's tongue

17:28.172 --> 17:31.009
is swelling up like a melon.

17:31.050 --> 17:32.176
I need a bathroom!

17:45.606 --> 17:46.983
I guess Cynthia was right.

17:47.025 --> 17:49.276
If you invite people to a party,

17:47.025 --> 17:49.276
they'll show up.

18:03.833 --> 18:05.334
They got a great laser show

18:03.833 --> 18:05.334

18:05.376 --> 18:06.627

I'm totally going

18:55.217 --> 18:58.888
to summer school.

19:00.807 --> 19:02.058
Dewey, go to your room.

19:02.100 --> 19:03.225
But Reese

19:03.267 --> 19:05.185
is the one who poisoned

19:03.267 --> 19:05.185
all those people.

19:05.227 --> 19:06.813
Now!

19:06.854 --> 19:08.272
What is wrong with you guys?

19:08.314 --> 19:10.190
You didn't even let me

19:08.314 --> 19:10.190
accept my trophy.

19:10.232 --> 19:12.192
Oh, I'll give you

19:10.232 --> 19:12.192
a trophy, mister.

19:12.234 --> 19:14.194
Honey, the whole cooking

19:12.234 --> 19:14.194
thing was my idea.

19:14.236 --> 19:15.195
I'll handle this.

19:15.237 --> 19:16.823
Reese, we pulled you

19:15.237 --> 19:16.823
out of class

19:16.864 --> 19:18.198
because we know

19:16.864 --> 19:18.198
you cheated.

19:18.240 --> 19:19.659
Now, you would

19:18.240 --> 19:19.659
have won easily.

19:19.700 --> 19:20.785
Why did you do it?

19:20.827 --> 19:21.828
I don't know.

19:21.869 --> 19:23.037
It was fun.

19:23.079 --> 19:24.705
Those people worked

19:23.079 --> 19:24.705
very hard on their dishes,

19:24.747 --> 19:25.873
and you destroyed them.

19:25.915 --> 19:27.083
How would you feel

19:27.125 --> 19:29.502
if you were that poor woman

19:27.125 --> 19:29.502
whose quiche you salted?

19:30.837 --> 19:31.629
Fat?

19:34.173 --> 19:35.382
Reese...

19:35.424 --> 19:37.217
do you know what empathy is?

19:37.259 --> 19:38.845
No.

19:38.886 --> 19:41.806
Empathy is putting yourself

19:38.886 --> 19:41.806
into other people's shoes

19:41.848 --> 19:43.683
so you can feel

19:41.848 --> 19:43.683
the way they do.

19:43.724 --> 19:46.644
If you hurt someone, empathy

19:43.724 --> 19:46.644
makes you hurt as well.

19:46.686 --> 19:50.064
Then, why would you want

19:46.686 --> 19:50.064
empathy?

19:53.734 --> 19:57.155
He has no more sense

19:53.734 --> 19:57.155
of right and wrong

19:53.734 --> 19:57.155
than a tree frog.

19:57.196 --> 19:58.614
What are we going to do?

19:58.656 --> 19:59.490
What can we do?

19:59.532 --> 20:01.241
It's back to punishment.

20:01.283 --> 20:03.703
How can we punish him if

20:01.283 --> 20:03.703
he doesn't care about...?

20:05.872 --> 20:08.499
All right, son, here's

20:05.872 --> 20:08.499
what's going to happen.

20:08.541 --> 20:11.961
For the next month,

20:08.541 --> 20:11.961
you are not allowed

20:08.541 --> 20:11.961
to cook a meal.

20:12.003 --> 20:13.171
That's it?

20:14.338 --> 20:17.299
So I don't cook, big deal.

20:17.341 --> 20:21.261
That means no chicken cordon

20:17.341 --> 20:21.261
bleu, no Windsor tortes.

20:21.303 --> 20:22.262
Wait a second.

20:22.304 --> 20:23.514
You said no cooking.

20:23.556 --> 20:24.891
The torte is baking.

20:24.932 --> 20:27.518
No baking, no broiling,

20:24.932 --> 20:27.518
no sautéing.

20:27.560 --> 20:28.895
Come on, you can't do that.

20:28.936 --> 20:30.479
You heard your father.

20:30.521 --> 20:32.982
The stove and all the whisks

20:30.521 --> 20:32.982
are off limits for a month.

20:33.024 --> 20:34.567
Oh, please, I'll be good.

20:33.024 --> 20:34.567
I promise.

20:34.608 --> 20:35.860
I'll do whatever you say.

20:35.902 --> 20:36.861
I'm sorry, son.

20:36.903 --> 20:38.779
This is the way

20:36.903 --> 20:38.779
it has to be.

20:44.744 --> 20:45.703
It worked.

20:45.745 --> 20:48.288
I think we really turned

20:45.745 --> 20:48.288
a corner with him.

20:48.330 --> 20:49.331
We have a weapon.

20:49.373 --> 20:51.500
His actions will have

20:49.373 --> 20:51.500
consequences.

20:51.542 --> 20:52.376
I know.

20:52.418 --> 20:53.377
We can hurt him.

20:53.419 --> 20:55.171
We can be parents again.

20:55.213 --> 20:57.924
Oh, it's even worth

20:55.213 --> 20:57.924
suffering through a month

20:57.965 --> 20:59.550
of eating your

20:57.965 --> 20:59.550
flank steaks.

20:59.592 --> 21:01.301
Amen to that.

21:01.343 --> 21:03.470
♪ Y'all gon' make me

21:01.343 --> 21:03.470
lose my mind ♪

21:03.512 --> 21:05.765
♪ Up in here, up in here... ♪

21:05.806 --> 21:08.308
You know, I just

21:05.806 --> 21:08.308
realized something.

21:08.350 --> 21:09.560
Parties suck.

21:09.602 --> 21:11.979
The music always stinks,

21:09.602 --> 21:11.979
the food's bad,

21:12.021 --> 21:14.148
and who cares

21:12.021 --> 21:14.148
if no one talks to you?

21:14.190 --> 21:16.109
People are such phonies anyway.

21:16.150 --> 21:17.777
Hey, Malcolm.

21:16.150 --> 21:17.777
Hey, Cynthia.

21:16.150 --> 21:17.777
Great party.

21:17.818 --> 21:20.320
I like the music,

21:17.818 --> 21:20.320
and what's in the dip?

21:20.362 --> 21:21.197
Ooh, you know what?

21:21.239 --> 21:22.949
I'm gonna need that chair.

21:26.368 --> 21:30.539
(dance music continues)
