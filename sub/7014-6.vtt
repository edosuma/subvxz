00:04.812 --> 00:07.637
So you gotta work at the radio
station on Christmas Eve?

00:08.128 --> 00:11.760
God, it's like doesn't anyone respect
the sanctity of that holy night?

00:11.844 --> 00:15.017
We were gonna get drunk and fool around
behind your dad's manger scene.

00:15.749 --> 00:17.766
But this is my first shot at DJ-ing.

00:17.817 --> 00:23.986
If I do well, Hot Donna could be the regular DJ
on Tuesdays from 1 to 5 am.

00:24.495 --> 00:27.092
Every insomniac and burn out in town
is gonna know who I am.

00:27.267 --> 00:29.574
Well say hello to your target audience.

00:31.335 --> 00:32.892
Play more Zeppelin.

00:33.896 --> 00:38.048
You guys, I've got some terrible news.
I've just been kicked off the cheerleading squad.

00:38.139 --> 00:40.791
- Oh my little Jesus!
- Oh no!
- Why?

00:42.070 --> 00:45.532
Jackie I know how you feel,
I once got kicked off a cheerleader.

00:47.775 --> 00:49.737
Well I need to get back on that squad.

00:49.856 --> 00:53.542
They might be a bunch of pom-pom waving bitches,
but they're all I know.

00:53.827 --> 00:57.000
Steven, you've gotta take me to the
"Christmas Eve dance" tomorrow night.

00:57.112 --> 00:58.497
Uh no.

00:59.456 --> 01:03.493
I can either dance with, or spend Christmas Eve with you;
cannot do a combo.

01:03.883 --> 01:06.823
Steven, they will never take me back
if I don't show up all proud.

01:06.897 --> 01:11.335
If you could just see...that this is something
that's...really important to me then...you'd
understand that as my boyfriend...you should go.

01:11.476 --> 01:12.399
Fine!

01:13.434 --> 01:14.530
Please...

01:15.861 --> 01:16.891
Fine!

01:18.205 --> 01:21.088
Hey shut up, if I'm going,
you guys are coming with me.

01:21.126 --> 01:24.067
Oh no, cannot go to a high school dance!

01:24.366 --> 01:27.193
I'm gonna be a father soon
I gotta start acting more mature.

01:27.652 --> 01:29.381
All right, orange!

01:32.845 --> 01:36.506
Yeah, I'm not going either.
The football team and I have a little disagreement.

01:36.506 --> 01:39.101
They think it's funny to stuff me into a locker,

01:40.413 --> 01:41.739
and I disagree!

01:42.833 --> 01:46.695
Yeah man, the day I graduated, I promised myself
I would never set foot in that

01:46.772 --> 01:48.790
God forsaken place again.

01:48.991 --> 01:50.317
Great news, kids.

01:50.670 --> 01:57.416
Red's gonna be the Santa down at the mall on Christmas Eve,
and I've signed you all up to be his little helpers.

02:01.457 --> 02:06.070
Oh, I'm sorry Mom, we're all going to the
Christmas Eve dance at school.

Don't go away kids,
A Year Without A Santa Claus will be right back.

02:50.218 --> 02:53.158
Man, Heat Miser is badass.

02:53.848 --> 02:55.740
So what time are you coming down the station tonight?

02:55.740 --> 02:59.431
Let's see, the Christmas dance starts eight o'clock,
so I'll just come as soon as it gets lame...

02:59.680 --> 03:01.237
say uh 8:02.

03:02.798 --> 03:07.930
Yeah. Hey y'know what, I'll even bring you something
sweet to munch on - oh and some cookies!

03:08.075 --> 03:09.980
What? Oh, What?

03:10.080 --> 03:11.810
Okay now,

03:13.072 --> 03:14.398
please stand still.

03:14.814 --> 03:17.699
Nobody likes a Santa with plumbers butt.

03:18.572 --> 03:26.299
- Why am I doing this?
- Because I wanna force some good cheer through
your clogged arteries and into your cranky heart.

03:26.661 --> 03:28.796
Yeah, it's like Christmas Draino.

03:30.710 --> 03:33.938
I can't believe
you're replacing me as Santa, Red.

03:34.129 --> 03:37.071
Three years and now management says
I'm too jolly?

03:38.209 --> 03:40.746
- What do you want, Bob?
- I want to be Santa!

03:40.917 --> 03:43.167
Well, it's Red's turn this year.

03:43.667 --> 03:45.512
Santa could use an elf.

03:45.923 --> 03:49.326
Fine.But I don't wanna sit in the back and
pretend to assemble toys,

03:49.449 --> 03:51.178
I want to participate.

03:51.729 --> 03:53.749
Yeah Bob, you gotta keep your dignity.

03:55.041 --> 03:59.424
If you're in an elf costume,
you don't want that tiny hammer making you look silly.

04:00.079 --> 04:05.384
Steven, for the Christmas Eve dance...What do you think about this tie...
Maybe this jacket...How about a blazer?
- Fine!

04:05.991 --> 04:07.202
Bolo?

04:07.854 --> 04:09.408
- Fine
- Ok!

04:15.976 --> 04:19.839
Okay Brooke, I made a list of all the reasons
why I'm gonna make a great dad

04:19.954 --> 04:20.992
for our little baby.

04:22.373 --> 04:25.372
Okay number one, I am a waiter,

04:27.122 --> 04:30.754
so we'll never run out of straws.

04:31.645 --> 04:33.375
See, look kids love straws

04:34.138 --> 04:38.060
Michel, look I really appreciate the gesture,
but no thanks.

04:38.449 --> 04:44.041
Seriously, I think if we just hang out,
you'll see that I'm getting a lot more mature.

04:44.203 --> 04:47.318
I mean, just the other day I watched golf,
and took a nap.

04:48.834 --> 04:52.524
Look Michael, if we weren't in this situation
I think you'd be a really good friend.

04:52.879 --> 04:58.300
I mean you're nice, you bring me stuff,dogs love you.

04:59.477 --> 05:02.359
I just think we should limit our time together...

05:02.883 --> 05:04.035
... to almost none.

05:04.100 --> 05:11.249
Alright, how about we make a compromise between
'almost none' and what I want to do, which is 'it'?

05:12.575 --> 05:18.224
Okay, if you want, you can help me hang decorations
tonight for the library's Christmas party.

05:18.538 --> 05:21.190
Spend Christmas Eve in a library?

05:21.510 --> 05:23.874
Why don't you just kick me in the 'nads?

05:33.316 --> 05:37.005
Okay, here comes Julie, the head cheerleader.
Now, Steven make me look good.

05:37.516 --> 05:39.995
- Hello Jackie.
- Hello Julie!

05:40.137 --> 05:43.251
This is my boyfriend,
Steven J. Hyde the third.

05:44.233 --> 05:45.905
First two are in jail.

05:48.094 --> 05:49.767
He pretends to be poor,

05:49.885 --> 05:51.730
isn't that funny?

05:52.733 --> 05:56.130
I have to say, I thought you'd be too embarrassed
to show your face here tonight.

05:56.168 --> 06:01.069
Well to be honest, I only came to see your outfit...
so I'd know what not to wear.

06:02.185 --> 06:05.125
Well, let me show you the back.

06:08.876 --> 06:11.732
You're trying to get back on the cheerleading squad;
shouldn't you be nice to her?

06:11.732 --> 06:14.673
Bitchiness is the only language cheerleaders understand.

06:14.770 --> 06:18.287
These are bad girls, they need to be punished,
and they know it.

06:20.051 --> 06:23.453
Yeah this is way better
than hanging out at the library with Brooke.

06:23.953 --> 06:25.106
Lotta great memories in here.

06:25.801 --> 06:26.898
Did it in there...

06:28.233 --> 06:29.675
did it back there...

06:30.363 --> 06:33.593
got caught by Miss Tompkins doing it down there...

06:34.483 --> 06:36.732
did it with Miss Tompkins over there.

06:37.891 --> 06:41.580
Everyone look for football players,
I cannot spend another holiday in a locker.

06:42.204 --> 06:47.451
And this time if I don't show up for two days,
come look for me.

06:48.586 --> 06:50.258
Oh my God, Eric Forman?

06:50.654 --> 06:52.844
You look great, I love your shirt.

06:53.203 --> 06:54.127
Really?

06:55.295 --> 06:58.236
I wore this shirt for four years,
and no one said a thing.

06:58.796 --> 07:00.814
I guess now you really fill it out.

07:02.265 --> 07:02.900
Thanks.

07:04.540 --> 07:09.039
I'm... I'm like up to seventeen push-ups a night so...

07:09.990 --> 07:14.602
No I don't think that's it.
I think it's because you're not a high school boy anymore.

07:14.803 --> 07:18.493
Yeah, you're eighteen now.
You've seen and done it all.

07:18.771 --> 07:21.541
No, no... yes..

07:22.902 --> 07:24.804
Yes I have.

07:27.618 --> 07:32.000
Hey, you need to watch out okay? Girls are talking to you,
I think there might be a practical joke in the works.

07:32.860 --> 07:37.213
No man, I don't think so.
I think it's cause I graduated.

07:37.501 --> 07:39.455
Hyde, am I cool now?

07:39.455 --> 07:42.856
Well, you're cool like margarine is butter.

07:43.424 --> 07:46.133
Close, but there's a little aftertaste.

08:42.311 --> 08:47.672
You're in the middle of a Christmas Eve rock block
on WFPP with me, Hot Donna.

08:50.405 --> 08:51.961
That was bacon.

08:53.394 --> 08:55.988
I recorded that myself earlier today.

08:56.944 --> 09:00.404
Stay tuned for more Christmas classics with me,
Hot Donna.

09:03.192 --> 09:05.730
I'm sorry but that is just too cool.

09:09.671 --> 09:12.497
Okay, Mr. Clause.

09:14.346 --> 09:16.249
Let's hear your best Santa laugh.

09:20.020 --> 09:22.098
You left out a 'ho', Red.

09:22.104 --> 09:25.737
It's three ho's,
did you even read the Santa manual?

09:26.248 --> 09:28.670
Okay Red, I'm sure you'll do fine.

09:28.718 --> 09:37.538
Just remember Santa is a cheerful, jolly fellow,
who never calls a child dumbass.

09:38.523 --> 09:40.098
So what do ya want for Christmas?

09:40.098 --> 09:41.531
I want a slinky.

09:41.531 --> 09:45.451
A slinky?
Oh you'll get sick of a slinky in a day.

09:45.646 --> 09:52.277
I'm putting you down for flash cards.
Math - that's what you're getting for Christmas. Next!

09:52.964 --> 09:56.598
- I want a pony.
- Ponies die.

09:57.443 --> 10:00.615
What you need is a good pair of boots.

10:01.175 --> 10:02.732
Go on keep it moving.

10:03.292 --> 10:05.369
I want a flying car.

10:05.417 --> 10:07.842
I did too when I was your age, kid.

10:07.955 --> 10:09.972
But then the future came and...

10:10.049 --> 10:12.471
took my dreams away.

10:13.278 --> 10:15.699
Just like it's gonna take yours.

10:16.460 --> 10:19.226
Okay, okay little girl, y'know what?

10:19.343 --> 10:23.724
I bet if you're extra good,
you'll get your flying car one day.

10:24.333 --> 10:26.354
Don't listen to her, it's a lie.

10:26.473 --> 10:28.606
Bad Santa.

10:33.597 --> 10:37.577
Yep, life after graduation sure is sweet.

10:38.559 --> 10:40.463
Some days I wake up and I'm like...

10:40.716 --> 10:44.004
"hey I'm having ice-cream for breakfast"

10:44.080 --> 10:47.302
And you know what, I do.

10:48.865 --> 10:51.627
Wow, so what have you two been
up to since graduation?

10:51.936 --> 10:54.202
She talked to me, what do I do?

10:54.999 --> 10:57.538
Yeah, I got a librarian pregnant.

10:58.874 --> 11:00.719
Damn, good answer.

11:01.895 --> 11:06.104
So, like Eric,
what are your plans for the future?

11:06.495 --> 11:11.511
Well, I guess
I'm just gonna keep on keepin' on, y'know?

11:12.926 --> 11:15.060
I'm thinking about buying a boat.

11:16.749 --> 11:18.940
Okay, we're back and uh,

11:19.384 --> 11:25.438
if my boyfriend's listening you're late and I'm a little worried
you're trapped in a snow drift or something.

11:25.514 --> 11:30.223
So honey if you're cold, I'm with ya baby.

11:30.223 --> 11:33.279
Okay so let's take some requests.
Hello, you're on the air.

11:33.508 --> 11:40.888
Hi, I'd like to dedicate 'He's the Greatest Dancer' by Sister Sledge,
to Eric Forman, the coolest guy at the Christmas dance.

11:42.549 --> 11:45.029
What? He's still at the dance?

11:45.261 --> 11:48.373
Sorry I have to go, he's telling us about his boat.

11:50.435 --> 11:52.108
That sneaky bastard.

11:53.256 --> 11:59.311
Uh, that sneaky bastard Santa Clause is on his way
with a non-stop block of classic Christmas tunes.

12:01.698 --> 12:07.003
And remember you're listening to WFPP with me,
Hot Donna.

12:09.471 --> 12:14.719
You hear that Eric Forman? That's not bacon,
that's your ass when I get a hold of you.

12:26.697 --> 12:29.004
Hey, I brought you something sweet to munch on -

12:29.139 --> 12:30.868
oh and some cookies!

12:32.846 --> 12:34.520
Oh man, I knew that was funny.

12:35.262 --> 12:37.915
Man, I can't stop thinking about Brooke.

12:38.467 --> 12:41.177
I mean, both you and me know
that every girl in here wants me...

12:41.357 --> 12:44.240
except for the couple of weirdo's that seem to want you...

12:44.756 --> 12:46.380
but I don't care about any on them.

12:46.380 --> 12:50.463
Look Kelso, are you sure you don't just have a crush
on Brooke because she's a librarian,

12:50.463 --> 12:53.750
and you've seen some librarian layout in Playboy?

12:54.749 --> 12:57.171
Eric, I'm sure that's part of it.

12:58.772 --> 13:00.906
Whatever, I'm going to the library.

13:02.152 --> 13:03.998
Whoa, that felt weird to say.

13:06.020 --> 13:08.444
Steven you don't look like
you're having a good time.

13:08.499 --> 13:10.055
I'm not.

13:10.213 --> 13:13.040
I know, but I need you to act like you are.

13:13.396 --> 13:17.893
Just think about stuff you enjoy,
like shoplifting or dirty jeans.

13:18.796 --> 13:23.006
Jackie, how come you never to me you
were dating an older man?

13:23.047 --> 13:26.565
Well I guess I was just distracted by the life
I lead outside of cheerleading,

13:26.725 --> 13:30.991
where I do fun and glamorous things,
with my older, mysterious boyfriend.

13:32.535 --> 13:36.916
That's true. Why just last week,
we sat on the couch and had a fight.

13:37.462 --> 13:38.847
I'm jealous.

13:41.600 --> 13:43.330
Ah this dance sucks.

13:44.972 --> 13:48.087
None of the girls remember me,
they all think I'm a waiter.

13:49.577 --> 13:52.661
Hey, I got an idea
how you can get these girls attention.

13:52.661 --> 13:55.658
Oh boy,
does it involve me hiding in the girl's bathroom?

13:56.769 --> 13:59.884
- No!
- Okay, we'll try your way.

14:03.932 --> 14:06.297
And that's what really happened...

14:06.651 --> 14:08.441
in Vietnam!

14:09.339 --> 14:14.010
- I don't understand!
- Neither do I, kid. Neither do I.

14:15.006 --> 14:18.235
Okay little boy, time to say goodbye to Santa.

14:19.259 --> 14:20.990
What's an ambush?

14:22.243 --> 14:25.241
It's a pretty bush with yellow flowers.

14:27.313 --> 14:30.830
Kitty I gotta tell ya, I'm good with kids...

14:31.926 --> 14:37.519
I really taught him something.
Y'know I think I'm beginning to feel the Christmas sprit.

14:37.687 --> 14:43.798
Well I'm glad Red, but let's try telling a Christmas story
where nobody gets caught in a fire fight.

14:48.001 --> 14:49.731
Bob what the hell are you doing?

14:49.892 --> 14:52.199
You're depressing the kids,
I'm Santa now.

14:53.063 --> 14:55.256
Get out of my chair Bob,

14:55.730 --> 14:58.959
or you're gonna get a candy cane up your chimney.

14:59.506 --> 15:00.948
I'm not moving.

15:01.209 --> 15:05.075
Kitty hold my silly red hat.

15:07.786 --> 15:10.899
You're right, I really am funny.

15:15.328 --> 15:17.866
What do you think you're doing?
Eric you never showed up,

15:18.037 --> 15:19.538
I was worried about you.

15:19.870 --> 15:24.829
Well I'm sorry, I guess I lost track of time,
maybe it's because I am a God to these people.

15:25.793 --> 15:30.290
Donna they like this shirt.
This is a horrible shirt.

15:30.811 --> 15:32.484
I gave you that shirt.

15:34.222 --> 15:36.647
I know, I love this shirt.

15:37.204 --> 15:42.566
Eric I can't believe you let yourself get a swelled head
just because a couple of high school kids think you're cool.

15:42.774 --> 15:47.618
Excuse me, aren't you Hot Donna?
You were so awesome on the radio today.

15:47.745 --> 15:49.475
You really think?

15:52.695 --> 15:53.791
Wait, what's going on?

15:54.249 --> 15:55.979
I think we're in for a treat.

16:26.300 --> 16:27.685
Nice decorations.

16:28.155 --> 16:31.500
I see you're using one of the better tasting glues.

16:33.463 --> 16:35.022
What are you doing here?

16:35.167 --> 16:40.701
Oh I just though instead of having
a fun Christmas Eve somewhere else,

16:40.817 --> 16:43.064
I'd rather have a boring one here with you.

16:43.797 --> 16:47.026
But we could have some fun.

16:47.648 --> 16:49.783
Michael, I've told you before,

16:49.859 --> 16:54.241
just because you come to the library after hours,
does not mean I'm gonna walk around topless.

16:55.145 --> 16:56.876
But it's Christmas.

16:59.837 --> 17:02.433
Oh here let me help you with the decorations.

17:02.974 --> 17:05.970
Pregnant women should not be standing on their tip toes,

17:05.970 --> 17:08.449
cause the baby will come out all cross eyed.

17:10.608 --> 17:15.566
Listen, if you think you're gonna get me interested in you
by being cute and making me laugh

17:18.083 --> 17:20.218
...well it's probably gonna work.

17:21.402 --> 17:26.417
But if you screw this up, I'm gonna ruin your credit
with thousands of dollars in library fines.

17:27.449 --> 17:34.887
Fair enough. Well what say we seal this newfound
friendship with a round of topless ornament hanging?

17:36.316 --> 17:39.662
Okay fine, whatever you wanna do...

17:39.845 --> 17:40.712
topless!

17:46.025 --> 17:49.082
This mall is only big enough for one Santa, Bob.

17:49.082 --> 17:52.427
Tell ya what, you name 5 reindeer and I'll step down.

17:52.471 --> 17:56.046
I can name 5 toes that are gonna be in your ass.

17:56.302 --> 18:01.088
Oh for goodness sake, why don't we stop
calling it Christmas and call it Assmas?

18:02.741 --> 18:05.048
Fine, I'll go.

18:05.316 --> 18:08.315
I only got worked up because Joanne's gone,
Donna's working.

18:08.673 --> 18:13.571
The only people I got at home are my two friends,
Egg and Nog.

18:14.210 --> 18:18.419
Alright fine.
You wanna be Santa, go ahead.

18:19.061 --> 18:19.983
- Thanks Red

18:20.238 --> 18:25.139
Yeah it's all for the best,
I've already eaten about 2 pounds of fake beard as it is.

18:25.935 --> 18:30.203
There he is.
Santa's the one that told me communists hate God.

18:33.617 --> 18:35.347
Gotta go Santa.

18:36.773 --> 18:38.272
Merry Christmas, Bob.

18:38.680 --> 18:40.814
Mrs. Clause needs a drink.

18:43.332 --> 18:46.619
And then I push a button,
and it sounds like bacon.

18:48.645 --> 18:51.990
This is so awesome,
we're like a celebrity couple.

18:53.013 --> 18:57.610
- It's intoxicating.
- Donna it is a heady brew.

18:58.320 --> 19:01.377
Hey let's go drink beer in front of some sophomores.
Come on.

19:02.323 --> 19:08.530
Jackie, in light of you showing up tonight with your boyfriend,
who by the way is totally cool, and a fox.

19:08.530 --> 19:10.030
Big newsflash there.

19:11.944 --> 19:15.578
I'd like to invite you to rejoin the cheer squad.

19:15.855 --> 19:16.835
Really?

19:24.339 --> 19:26.645
You know I don't think
I wanna be a cheerleader anymore.

19:27.163 --> 19:29.183
But we hugged and jumped.

19:30.775 --> 19:35.041
Well I'm gonna have to take back that hug
and jump with a pout and a shrug.

19:39.197 --> 19:41.908
Are you telling me
I came to this hell hole for nothing?

19:41.910 --> 19:43.966
No, not for nothing, Steven.

19:43.966 --> 19:46.503
I realised these girls aren't my friends anymore.

19:46.794 --> 19:48.872
I learned something about myself.

19:49.014 --> 19:50.975
Oh, well isn't that ...

19:53.103 --> 19:56.678
Okay, well if it makes you feel any better,
I get to keep the uniform.

19:57.491 --> 19:58.703
Yeah that helps.

20:01.845 --> 20:06.573
You set me up, 'sing a song they'll all love you',
well I'm gonna spend Christmas in a locker.

20:53.774 --> 20:56.542
Oh crap, I'm still on the air!

21:12.094 --> 21:12.901
Hmm.
Jigsaw puzzle.

21:17.320 --> 21:18.879
Baseball glove.

21:21.702 --> 21:23.547
Barbie doll tea set.

21:24.540 --> 21:26.963
- Wow, you're good at this.
- Yeah, I've had a little practice.

21:27.486 --> 21:28.640
Ant farm.

21:32.826 --> 21:35.363
It's a Lone Ranger cap gun set.
