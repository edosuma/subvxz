00:11.256 --> 00:13.616
Tonight, James draws on a board,

00:15.534 --> 00:16.894
Richard waves at a man

00:17.734 --> 00:20.714
and I run away from a table!

00:27.970 --> 00:30.890
Hello, everybody. Hello and welcome.

00:31.290 --> 00:33.530
Thank you so much. Thank you.

00:34.730 --> 00:37.290
I am often asked,
well, I am sometimes asked,

00:37.770 --> 00:39.890
well, actually,
I was once asked by one person,

00:40.410 --> 00:44.330
why we review fast Vauxhalls
so rarely on Top Gear.

00:45.410 --> 00:47.930
The simple answer -
they're terrible rubbish.

00:48.450 --> 00:52.410
Vauxhall, however, has just
introduced a new fast Astra

00:53.050 --> 00:54.850
and says it isn't terrible rubbish.

00:56.650 --> 00:57.450
Hmmm.

01:02.730 --> 01:04.970
It's called the VXR and on paper,

01:05.370 --> 01:07.610
it certainly appears to be
terrible rubbish.

01:11.210 --> 01:13.850
Because what they've done,
bless them, is fit under the bonnet

01:14.250 --> 01:16.490
of a front-wheel drive
Vauxhall Astra,

01:16.850 --> 01:19.250
a 276 horsepower engine.

01:22.730 --> 01:27.490
That's as daft as fitting the heart-
of an elephant in a mouse.

01:31.850 --> 01:34.090
The thing is, the front wheels
have to do the steering

01:34.330 --> 01:36.410
and that's a big, important job.

01:36.810 --> 01:40.730
And asking them
to handle 276 horsepower as well,

01:41.290 --> 01:44.650
means you've to do some
very, very clever engineering.

01:49.490 --> 01:50.330
Not that long ago,

01:50.730 --> 01:54.930
Vauxhall was making the not-at-all
cleverly engineered Vectra.

01:55.410 --> 01:59.650
The most dreary, uninspiring
car in all of human history.

02:02.130 --> 02:03.490
Oh!

02:04.890 --> 02:06.850
It really was a cure for ADD.

02:07.210 --> 02:09.371
If you put a hyperactive child
in there, he'd be asleep

02:09.410 --> 02:11.490
in three minutes flat.
I mean, look at it!

02:13.010 --> 02:15.090
It's as gripping
as a Victorian novel,

02:15.490 --> 02:17.730
as stylish as a taxman's trousers.

02:18.250 --> 02:21.210
You almost got the impression
they designed it in a coffee break.

02:22.250 --> 02:24.650
Oh, quick, the boss wants
a new car. There's one.

02:25.410 --> 02:26.690
Give it some fancy door mirrors.

02:26.770 --> 02:29.010
It'll look like we made
an effort. They hadn't!

02:30.530 --> 02:33.050
So the idea that a company
which did this,

02:33.570 --> 02:37.650
now thinks it has the technical
ability to put 276 horsepowers

02:38.170 --> 02:40.970
through the front wheels of
a hatchback is laughable.

02:43.850 --> 02:45.250
The thing is though, amazingly,

02:45.650 --> 02:46.770
they've pulled it off!

02:48.000 --> 02:54.074

02:58.650 --> 03:02.010
It has a clever front diff
and unlike a normal Astra,

03:02.250 --> 03:05.210
it has hydraulic power steering.

03:06.970 --> 03:09.890
It also has the same
sort of dampers that Ferrari use

03:10.570 --> 03:14.210
and James tells me
it has separate hub carriers.

03:15.570 --> 03:16.850
Which is interesting!

03:19.890 --> 03:22.450
Plainly then, they've spent more
time and effort on the front end

03:22.650 --> 03:25.850
of this car, than they did
on the whole of the Vectra.

03:26.530 --> 03:28.610
And the rewards are huge.

03:31.650 --> 03:35.010
There's no torque steer,
there is no fuss, there is no drama,

03:35.410 --> 03:39.050
the power is just there
when you want it.

03:40.410 --> 03:42.650
It might not be the most fun
car in the world,

03:43.050 --> 03:45.410
it actually feels quite heavy,

03:45.810 --> 03:49.170
but, my God, it is quick!

03:56.850 --> 04:00.370
And best of all, despite extremely
wide low-profile tyres,

04:01.490 --> 04:04.250
it has a comfortable ride as well.

04:06.450 --> 04:07.850
If you like being uncomfortable,

04:08.370 --> 04:11.130
you can push this sport button here-
which firms everything up

04:11.930 --> 04:14.730
and if you want to feel like you're-
falling down a rocky escarpment,

04:15.130 --> 04:16.970
you can push this one.

04:17.730 --> 04:19.970
If you do that, watch, ready...

04:20.370 --> 04:22.330
look, all the dials glow red

04:22.970 --> 04:25.490
to warn you that your neck
is about to snap.

04:26.290 --> 04:29.090
Probably better to leave
those buttons alone, clearly.

04:31.730 --> 04:37.890
This is a damn good car. It's solid,
good looking and very, very fast.

04:38.530 --> 04:42.050
Plus, because it's a hatchback,
it's practical as well.

04:44.370 --> 04:46.330
There are, as I see it,
only two problems.

04:46.850 --> 04:51.490
One - at just shy of £27,000,
it is quite expensive.

04:52.450 --> 04:55.810
And two - when you are asked at
parties what you're driving

04:56.730 --> 05:01.490
these days, you're going to have
to start by saying... erm...

05:04.650 --> 05:05.771
Perhaps then, we should look

05:06.290 --> 05:09.930
at the Astra's chief rival -
the Ford Focus ST.

05:10.730 --> 05:13.250
This has five doors, so it is more
practical than the Vauxhall.

05:14.090 --> 05:17.130
It's £5,000 cheaper and at parties,

05:17.530 --> 05:20.770
you can say you own a Ford
without blushing.

05:21.690 --> 05:25.770
But it simply isn't
as nice to drive.

05:27.650 --> 05:30.010
Instead of taming the front end
with proper mechanical

05:30.410 --> 05:33.770
engineering like Vauxhall did,
Ford has used electronic systems

05:34.730 --> 05:37.930
and the truth is,
they're not as good.

05:40.130 --> 05:42.930
You can sense the electrons
doing their absolute best to

05:43.450 --> 05:48.370
keep things neat and tidy,
but you can also sense them, erm...

05:49.410 --> 05:51.090
failing!

05:53.130 --> 05:55.210
There's torque steer,
there's understeer,

05:56.130 --> 05:57.810
and then there's
lift off oversteer.

05:58.370 --> 06:02.290
There.
It is a smorgasbord of waywardness.

06:05.730 --> 06:10.210
I also have to say the Ford has
a particularly unpleasant interior.

06:10.730 --> 06:13.250
And it does not look very
good from the outside either.

06:13.770 --> 06:17.410
Nowhere near as good as the Astra,
that's for sure.

06:17.930 --> 06:23.650
So, as an enthusiast's car, I have
to say the Vauxhall is better.

06:30.050 --> 06:32.290
But this is Top Gear
and I can't very well sit here

06:32.970 --> 06:38.010
and say, "Hey, petrol heads,
the best hot hatchback
is a Vauxhall Astra."

06:39.930 --> 06:42.570
That would be like a travel person
saying, "Hey, holidaymakers,

06:43.130 --> 06:47.050
"the best place for your
summer vacation is Belgium!"

06:50.090 --> 06:53.570
So, let's keep going
and look at another option.

07:00.010 --> 07:02.250
The Renault Megane 265.

07:02.770 --> 07:05.450
This is the darling
of all the car magazines.

07:05.810 --> 07:09.170
They love it
and it's easy to see why.

07:22.770 --> 07:25.290
You can just tell this car was
designed by a team of people

07:26.370 --> 07:30.290
who really know what enthusiasts
want when they're on the track.

07:30.690 --> 07:31.770
It's sublime.

07:39.010 --> 07:41.570
They've even fitted it with a
special readout that shows how fast

07:41.930 --> 07:43.050
you went from 0 to 60,

07:43.570 --> 07:46.210
how fast you did the standing
quarter, your lap times,

07:47.010 --> 07:49.530
how much power you're using,
how much brake you're using,

07:50.890 --> 07:55.650
your throttle position, a graph,
an extreme graph,

07:56.050 --> 07:57.730
your G metre.

07:58.490 --> 08:00.570
The Stig just loves this.

08:01.810 --> 08:02.610
He's been running around all
morning squawking

08:03.010 --> 08:04.690
and clutching at his tinkle!

08:06.490 --> 08:08.970
And I have too, if I'm honest!

08:11.210 --> 08:15.410
It's just an amazing combination
of nimbleness and brute force.

08:18.050 --> 08:20.410
There's no doubt that it's more
exciting than the Vauxhall

08:20.930 --> 08:24.850
and less wayward than the Ford
and faster than both of them.

08:27.650 --> 08:30.130
To show you how much faster,
I engaged sport mode

08:30.650 --> 08:33.610
and pulled up for a drag race.

08:38.770 --> 08:40.409
Watch and learn, Vauxhall!

08:46.010 --> 08:47.090
What?

08:47.770 --> 08:49.010
Come on!

08:49.410 --> 08:51.650
Come on! Faster!

08:52.450 --> 08:57.210
Come on-n-n-n!

09:01.810 --> 09:05.290
That was not supposed to happen.

09:06.970 --> 09:10.610
Much to my surprise then,
the Renault was the slowest.

09:11.010 --> 09:12.810
And when you bear
equipment levels in mind,

09:13.170 --> 09:15.450
it is the most expensive, too.

09:15.810 --> 09:18.050
And it's also the least nice.

09:19.810 --> 09:22.610
Sitting in here is a bit like
sitting in Eeyore's gloomy place,

09:23.130 --> 09:26.210
it is all very dark and everything
you touch and everything you use

09:26.610 --> 09:30.650
feels flimsy, like it will come off-
or break at any moment.

09:31.610 --> 09:34.130
And the back's very cramped
and the ride's very hard,

09:34.610 --> 09:37.130
this seat is very low down
and very snug

09:37.690 --> 09:41.170
and gives you an idea of what
it would be like to be buried alive.

09:41.850 --> 09:46.610
And look at this. You can't wear
a pink shirt or it'll clash.

09:48.930 --> 09:51.850
So, while this may be
the nicest car
to drive on a track or

09:52.130 --> 09:53.930
a deserted moorland road,

09:54.850 --> 09:58.650
it would not be the nicest to live
with on a day-to-day basis.

10:00.410 --> 10:04.050
That means we arrive at a rather
worrying conclusion because,

10:04.410 --> 10:07.930
if I were to choose one of these
three cars to drive home in tonight,

10:08.330 --> 10:09.570
it would be...

10:10.090 --> 10:11.210
the...

10:18.290 --> 10:21.490
What happened there?
The camera broke. Did it?

10:21.850 --> 10:24.410
Yeah, no, it literally just broke
there. Did it?

10:24.770 --> 10:28.290
And what were you about to say?
Erm, I can't remember.

10:28.810 --> 10:31.890
You were about to say the Vauxhall.
A bit.

10:32.410 --> 10:35.090
It's a surprisingly likeable car.
It just is.

10:35.610 --> 10:38.410
Isn't that a bit like saying
Piers Morgan is a surprisingly

10:38.930 --> 10:41.091
likeable man, but in the end,
he is still fundamentally

10:41.770 --> 10:44.450
Piers Morgan, isn't he? Awful man.
Yes, I know what you mean.

10:46.490 --> 10:47.610
Look, hold on a minute.

10:48.570 --> 10:50.851
The Ford is £5,000 cheaper,
it is the most practical, with

10:51.290 --> 10:54.690
the most doors and we've just seen
it is the fastest. I'd have that.

10:56.050 --> 10:58.731
There's a lot to commend the Ford.
You're right. I like the Renault.

10:59.210 --> 11:02.010
Oh God! This is brilliant
buyers' advice, isn't it?

11:02.810 --> 11:03.930
I'd have the Ford,
you'd have the Renault,

11:04.450 --> 11:08.530
and he'd have the Piers Morgan. I
know how we can sort this out.

11:08.930 --> 11:10.730
The tame racing driver.

11:11.930 --> 11:15.450
Some say he contains 47% horse.

11:18.570 --> 11:21.370
And that to concentrate
more on his work here,

11:21.890 --> 11:25.290
he's resigned, this week,
from his other job in Rome.

11:28.690 --> 11:30.370
All we know is,
he's called The Stig!

11:31.850 --> 11:34.250
'And they're off.
Sluggish start from the Ford.

11:34.610 --> 11:35.330
'But it soon bites

11:35.690 --> 11:38.370
'and finds its stride on the way to-
the first corner.

11:39.850 --> 11:42.090
'And it's the Renault
looking twitchy into there,

11:42.650 --> 11:44.850
'the other two nicely controlled
and gripping hard.'

11:49.970 --> 11:51.330
'The Stig still listening to
national anthems

11:51.730 --> 11:53.970
'and a cacophony of patriotic noise.

11:55.050 --> 11:56.570
'All tracking cleanly around
Chicago

11:57.090 --> 11:59.770
'now spooling up the turbos
for the run to Hammerhead,

12:00.410 --> 12:02.930
'hard on the brakes, might see
something mealier from the Focus.

12:04.130 --> 12:06.810
'But no. Almost threatening
to cock a back wheel.

12:07.650 --> 12:10.690
'And the Renault just scampers away-
like a cheese-crazed sport monkey.'

12:17.050 --> 12:19.450
'Wow! A stack of Stigs there.
Follow-through.

12:20.410 --> 12:21.930
'The Focus is getting out of shape,

12:22.570 --> 12:24.050
'quickly pulls it back
together again.

12:24.930 --> 12:28.690
'Quick through the tyres, two
corners left, the Vauxhall appears

12:29.370 --> 12:31.571
'to be composed,
the Renault looking
bumpy on the way in.

12:31.970 --> 12:36.050
'It's the most track-ready car here.
Here they come, up to Gambon.

12:36.850 --> 12:39.210
'No dramas at all
and across the line.'

12:42.930 --> 12:45.730
I have the times here
and they are not that fast.

12:47.370 --> 12:50.130
The Ford Focus did it in 1.29.6.

12:50.570 --> 12:54.610
The Vauxhall Astra did a 1.28.3

12:55.130 --> 12:56.250
and the Renault Megane,

12:57.050 --> 13:00.250
the most track-focused of them all, -
did a 1.27.7.

13:00.650 --> 13:02.170
So therefore, the conclusion is,

13:02.730 --> 13:05.490
if you want a relatively
inexpensive, fun car,

13:05.890 --> 13:08.570
buy the Toyota GT 86!

13:12.810 --> 13:14.210
We're really not much good at that
consumer advice thing, are we?

13:14.610 --> 13:18.370
Anyway, we must now do the news.
Yes, and it's bad news!

13:19.330 --> 13:21.130
Dacia have got their name wrong.

13:21.650 --> 13:23.410
Have you seen the car ads
they've been doing?

13:23.570 --> 13:25.290
They keep referring to
themselves as Datcha.

13:25.770 --> 13:26.650
I think that's because

13:27.130 --> 13:29.130
that's how you say it in Romania,
where it's built.

13:30.010 --> 13:31.811
There's another labelling
problem they've got,

13:32.090 --> 13:33.810
because I was reading up
on the new Sandero.

13:34.010 --> 13:36.090
It says it's got 90 horsepower.
With everything
that's been going on,

13:36.610 --> 13:38.010
how do we know that isn't cow
power?

13:38.530 --> 13:39.490
Yeah. Good point.

13:40.850 --> 13:43.370
Because those abattoirs are in
Romania,

13:44.050 --> 13:45.570
allegedly. Apparently.

13:46.530 --> 13:48.650
We went to Romania once
and we did see a lot of people

13:48.730 --> 13:50.810
riding around on cows,
rounding up horses.

13:51.890 --> 13:52.850
And all their farmers complaining
about getting up early

13:53.410 --> 13:54.770
to milk the horses! Exactly.

13:56.410 --> 14:00.490
So, it is a 90 cow power car,
we've established now. Good.

14:01.290 --> 14:03.770
On the show, we've always said you
can't be a proper petrolhead

14:04.050 --> 14:05.290
until you've owned an Alfa,
which has always been

14:05.690 --> 14:07.650
an embarrassing problem for me,
because I haven't.

14:08.010 --> 14:10.930
But that might be about to change
with this, the Alfa Romeo 4C.

14:11.890 --> 14:14.130
A little two seater,
1.8 litre turbocharged engine

14:14.770 --> 14:17.010
mounted in the middle,
chassis made of carbon fibre.

14:17.930 --> 14:20.450
At least it won't rust.
They'll find a way.

14:22.370 --> 14:25.091
They'll have bought cheap Russian
carbon fibre that somehow oxidises.

14:25.450 --> 14:27.090
You know what Alfa's like!
How much is it?

14:27.490 --> 14:29.170
It's going to cost between
40 and 50,000.

14:29.970 --> 14:31.410
I have a bit of a problem with that.

14:31.890 --> 14:34.410
I don't think the looks are quite
right. Eh? It's gorgeous.

14:34.770 --> 14:36.490
I think it's a bit too tall.
Exactly. It is.

14:36.850 --> 14:39.730
I'll tell you how it does look good-
though, is if you see the plan view.

14:40.010 --> 14:42.530
We've got one of those.
Now that, I think, is good.

14:43.050 --> 14:46.970
That's a view Hammond will never
have! Oh, come on. Please!

14:47.770 --> 14:51.010
Haa-haa! Open door. Yeah, all right.

14:51.930 --> 14:54.651
Now the Ford Mustang we featured
last week in the race across Europe,

14:55.530 --> 14:57.770
that seems to have captured
the hearts and minds of everybody,
I mean, really.

14:58.290 --> 15:00.730
Everywhere I've been, all week,
people have been talking to me

15:00.770 --> 15:03.010
about that car. Yeah, non-stop.
Well, big news.

15:04.090 --> 15:05.890
Ford has announced, because they've-
never sold the Mustang

15:06.410 --> 15:08.930
officially in Britain, since 1964,
they've announced that the

15:09.450 --> 15:11.850
next generation of Mustang
coming next year, will be

15:12.210 --> 15:14.890
built with right-hand drive
and will be sold in Britain.

15:15.530 --> 15:16.930
About time, brilliant, good news.

15:17.610 --> 15:19.970
There is, however,
a tiny bit of bad news. What?

15:20.770 --> 15:24.010
Well, the V8 version will be
sold in America, but,

15:24.810 --> 15:26.210
because we're only British,

15:26.850 --> 15:29.250
all we can have is a two litre
eco-boost engine.

15:30.450 --> 15:33.090
Oh, for God's sake!
Do they think we want that?

15:33.770 --> 15:35.290
I can't understand their logic.

15:36.810 --> 15:39.370
If you want a Mustang,
it is because
you want a big V8 muscle car,

15:39.570 --> 15:40.810
there is no other reason
for buying one. Precisely.

15:41.490 --> 15:43.091
So if you want a two litre
eco-boost car,

15:43.650 --> 15:45.650
you are going to buy a Golf diesel.-
Not a Mustang.

15:45.850 --> 15:47.330
It's like saying
I formed a punk band,

15:47.770 --> 15:50.170
we got cellos, except for Sebastian,
he has a harp.

15:51.090 --> 15:52.490
Nobody wants a harp in a punk band,

15:52.890 --> 15:55.330
nobody wants a two litre eco-boost
engine in a bloody Mustang.

15:56.210 --> 15:58.530
You can keep it, we don't want it.
Just keep it. Keep them.

16:00.090 --> 16:01.691
Now, the most important
news of the week.

16:02.130 --> 16:03.370
As you may have noticed,
modern cars now have been given

16:03.770 --> 16:06.210
electronic handbrakes, rather than
a lever. This is a problem,

16:06.650 --> 16:10.170
because you can't do a handbrake
turn with an electronic button.

16:10.850 --> 16:12.210
And this is bad news,

16:13.010 --> 16:15.650
because handbrake turns are an
essential part of male development,

16:16.450 --> 16:17.850
because as we all know,

16:18.770 --> 16:22.130
the handbrake lever is connected
directly to a girl's sexual
appetite!

16:23.090 --> 16:27.290
It is. It is. When you're 17, it is.
You're smiling and you know it is.

16:27.810 --> 16:30.210
You see it in the animal kingdom.
A peacock has his feathers.

16:30.570 --> 16:34.090
The young man has his handbrake.
Exactly. They do the same job.

16:34.610 --> 16:36.570
And if you have a button,
it doesn't work. No.

16:37.090 --> 16:40.450
I can remember my first attempt
at seduction with the handbrake

16:40.850 --> 16:41.810
when I was 17 years old.

16:42.210 --> 16:44.010
I was going to pick up this girl
called Liz from outside a pub

16:44.410 --> 16:45.410
and I had it all planned.

16:45.770 --> 16:47.730
I'd go in and I'd get on
the handbrake and slew it round

16:47.970 --> 16:50.490
like the Italian Job and the
rest was a formality, obviously.

16:51.690 --> 16:54.451
I went through the gate, quite hot, -
pulled on the lever and that was

16:54.730 --> 16:55.850
when the cable snapped.

16:58.290 --> 17:00.770
I think it was because I had spent
the previous day practising,

17:01.290 --> 17:03.970
you see... Only you would
practise a
handbrake turn! You have to.

17:04.650 --> 17:07.849
Wish I had. What? I remember taking-
a girl called Cathy home one night.

17:08.089 --> 17:10.050
I was 17, in my mum's Audi.

17:10.690 --> 17:12.730
And she lived in the middle
of a field and I do mean

17:12.930 --> 17:14.450
in the middle of a field,
no tracks, anything.

17:14.690 --> 17:15.930
Was she called Ermintrude?

17:18.250 --> 17:22.290
Did she wear a nice big bell? No,
she wasn't a cow! Moo. Or a horse.

17:22.690 --> 17:23.930
No, no.

17:24.890 --> 17:27.690
Anyway, I am going down the grassy
hill, to the house and thought,

17:28.089 --> 17:30.170
I know what will tip her
over the edge. Brrt!

17:31.090 --> 17:35.290
Pirouetted straight through her
dad's hedge. Was she impressed?

17:37.090 --> 17:40.450
I know she was,
because she pulled a
face that was exactly like this.

17:43.770 --> 17:45.010
That's the face,
that's the face they pull

17:45.290 --> 17:46.250
in that part of the mating ritual.

17:46.650 --> 17:48.130
I know,
because I have seen that face.

17:48.970 --> 17:51.050
When I was a young man, 17,
borrowing my dad's car,

17:51.450 --> 17:52.570
diesel Astra estate,

17:54.050 --> 17:55.730
and I was giving Katie from college
a lift home, she lived on a farm,

17:56.130 --> 17:58.370
down farm tracks and I had already
warmed her up

17:58.770 --> 18:00.730
with a bit of rally driving!

18:02.050 --> 18:03.890
There was already
a sexual tension in the car.

18:05.130 --> 18:07.530
And I thought, "I'll seal the deal
with the handbrake lever,"

18:07.890 --> 18:10.810
yanked it on, slewed round, hit a
rock. She pulled that exact face.

18:11.370 --> 18:13.850
What, the...? Sometimes girls say,
"What did you do that for?"

18:15.050 --> 18:17.251
That's it. What they're actually
saying is, "I'm ready!"

18:20.050 --> 18:24.010
But I never got that face from Liz, -
because as far she was concerned,

18:24.770 --> 18:26.730
she didn't know I had tried to do a-
handbrake turn, because

18:27.130 --> 18:29.371
I had just got that twang, that was-
the only twang I got

18:30.010 --> 18:32.250
on that evening!
As far as she could see,

18:33.010 --> 18:35.690
I had just parked badly
the wrong way round.

18:36.770 --> 18:40.290
She just thought I was an cars. I
think I know why they're doing this.

18:40.770 --> 18:43.570
It's to cut down on unwanted
teenage pregnancy.

18:45.490 --> 18:47.091
And it could work.
It's a clever thought.

18:47.570 --> 18:50.490
It'll probably work, but it'll also-
cut down on the future of mankind.

18:51.730 --> 18:53.730
I think it is irresponsible.
If you think about it,

18:53.770 --> 18:57.130
if a man can't use a handbrake to
pull a girl, what's he going to do?

18:58.370 --> 19:00.370
There's going to be
a lot of frustrated men around.

19:00.690 --> 19:05.050
You may have to talk to her.
No! No! Car makers, please, stop it.

19:05.570 --> 19:09.770
You're meddling with forces unseen
and more powerful than you.

19:11.410 --> 19:13.490
Shall we get back to cars?
Yeah, let's do it.

19:14.170 --> 19:16.490
Peugeot, as we know, are
the worst driven cars on the road,

19:17.050 --> 19:19.570
always doing 40 in the outside lane,
they're always in your way.

19:20.530 --> 19:23.330
But now there is a new car from
Peugeot. We have it here

19:23.850 --> 19:28.210
in the studio. It's called the Onyx.
It looks absolutely fantastic

19:29.010 --> 19:32.650
and you'll notice that some
of the bodywork is made from copper.

19:33.850 --> 19:37.650
Just like the boiler tubes
on a Greeley A4 Streamliner Pacific.

19:38.010 --> 19:39.690
Yes, James, yes, yes.

19:40.210 --> 19:43.570
And it's actually untreated copper, -
so over time, it'll turn green

19:44.250 --> 19:47.170
unless a scrap metal merchant
removes it in the night.

19:49.090 --> 19:51.490
Inside they've continued
the theme of
using unusual materials,

19:52.130 --> 19:55.210
so the dashboard is made out of
recycled newspaper.

19:57.130 --> 19:57.970
I'm guessing they'll have used
the Guardian for everything

19:58.370 --> 20:00.890
on the left and the Telegraph
for everything on the right!

20:01.570 --> 20:03.370
Actually the newspaper is good
because it means there is no need to

20:03.930 --> 20:07.611
Bluetooth your phone to it.
The dashboard will already have
listened to your messages for you.

20:09.890 --> 20:14.930
The engine is 680 horsepower
V8 turbo diesel hybrid.

20:15.850 --> 20:19.370
That means a top speed
in the outside lane of 40.

20:21.130 --> 20:24.490
Anyway, this is the future, perhaps,
but now we must return to

20:25.450 --> 20:27.690
the present, because we have some
important information.

20:28.490 --> 20:32.010
The Kia Cee'd, which we use
as our reasonably priced car

20:32.490 --> 20:37.570
has been updated and the new
version
is taking the world by storm.

20:44.690 --> 20:45.770
This is it.

20:46.450 --> 20:48.051
It has only
been on sale for eight months

20:48.210 --> 20:51.730
and already it has won the coveted
Northern Car Of The Year award.

20:53.770 --> 20:55.170
A chap called Derek Grocock

20:55.850 --> 20:58.650
who is vice chairman of the
Northern
Group Of Motoring Writers

20:59.850 --> 21:03.050
said it had impressed the judges
with its comfort, value,

21:03.610 --> 21:07.930
reliability, quality,
and its seven-year warranty.

21:10.730 --> 21:13.650
But this is Top Gear
and we are interested in,

21:14.210 --> 21:16.850
all of that obviously,
but rather more besides.

21:20.490 --> 21:24.250
So now let's see how well
it does at
all the things that matter to us.

21:36.010 --> 21:39.530
Of course there is only one man
we can turn to for an answer.
Matt LeBlanc,

21:40.490 --> 21:43.970
the fastest star we have ever
had in our reasonably priced car.

21:44.690 --> 21:46.450
Of course Matt lives in Los Angeles

21:47.010 --> 21:50.210
but he appreciated
the importance of the question.

22:02.410 --> 22:03.770
First, the old car.

22:09.450 --> 22:12.810
Old versus new.
The age-old question.

22:25.970 --> 22:27.770
And now, the new version.

22:29.690 --> 22:31.370
Ah, that new-car smell. Huh?

22:47.610 --> 22:48.730
So there we are.

22:53.890 --> 22:56.290
Thanks a lot. Thank you. Any time.

22:56.770 --> 23:02.130
With Matt gone I moved on to a test-
I could handle myself.

23:09.770 --> 23:13.850
I'm coming up now
to a row of parked
cars in a top-of-the-range Cee'd

23:14.770 --> 23:16.890
which has this
little button down here.

23:17.410 --> 23:21.490
If I push it, sensors start to scan-
the gaps to see if any of them

23:22.570 --> 23:27.330
are big enough for me to park in.
What about this gap here?

23:30.650 --> 23:32.690
I don't think that's big enough.
Does the car agree?

23:32.850 --> 23:35.490
It will "bong" if it thinks
it's big
enough. It didn't like that.

23:35.930 --> 23:36.731
What about this one?

23:39.570 --> 23:40.570
There it is.

23:41.450 --> 23:44.570
Now that's very impressive.
But what
it does next is even better.

23:45.090 --> 23:49.010
If I put it in reverse
I am told this will go into that
gap

23:50.530 --> 23:52.890
with no steering input
at all from me.

23:53.570 --> 23:57.490
To see if that is true
I am going to wear a blindfold. OK.

23:58.010 --> 24:01.330
I can now see nothing at all.
Here we go.

24:05.090 --> 24:10.690
Easing it backwards. Hands not
on the wheel. Oh, my God,
it's turning.

24:12.370 --> 24:13.610
This is spooky.

24:16.210 --> 24:18.330
I'm going to get some beeps
to tell me when

24:19.410 --> 24:19.930
I'm close to the car behind.

24:20.490 --> 24:23.130
There we are.

24:23.530 --> 24:24.930
Then I put it in drive.

24:26.130 --> 24:28.930
This...

24:31.130 --> 24:32.370
This is weird now.

24:34.290 --> 24:38.770
If I take this off and I am parked
I shall be amazed.

24:45.850 --> 24:48.170
So now let's consider some rather
more important questions.

24:53.530 --> 24:54.650
Yes.

25:00.450 --> 25:01.690
We plugged the lead into
the auxiliary socket

25:02.210 --> 25:04.610
and asked a local
guitarist to try it out.

25:17.850 --> 25:19.810
He seemed quite impressed.

25:22.450 --> 25:24.810
So far then the little Kia
is passing all our tests

25:25.370 --> 25:27.570
and passing them well,

25:28.810 --> 25:30.090
but I know what you're thinking.

25:34.490 --> 25:38.570
This is a big problem because
if you have your container of water

25:39.090 --> 25:41.890
for the eel
and even a small amount of sodium -

25:42.650 --> 25:44.610
I've only got 100 grams here -
and the two were to

25:45.010 --> 25:49.370
come into contact with one another, -
the results could be catastrophic.

25:49.890 --> 25:51.290
As I shall now demonstrate.

26:04.570 --> 26:07.650
Time and time again we hear
about eel and sodium salesmen

26:08.290 --> 26:10.930
going about their business
when all of a sudden...

26:15.530 --> 26:17.370
their car explodes.

26:22.650 --> 26:25.410
To make sure that doesn't happen
in the Cee'd, special segregated

26:25.930 --> 26:28.730
trays are fitted underneath
the boot floor

26:29.530 --> 26:31.490
so you can have your sodium
in one tray,

26:32.130 --> 26:36.650
separated from the water into which-
I am now going to place an eel.

26:38.130 --> 26:42.050
There we go. Don't jiggle about.
You'll get water on the sodium.

26:42.570 --> 26:48.610
That's what happened to your mum.
Stay. Good eel. Excellent.

26:49.250 --> 26:51.210
Now we will just close
the boot floor.

26:52.850 --> 26:55.650
That really is an intelligent
piece of design.

27:01.650 --> 27:03.170
So now let's look at another vital
issue that was not

27:03.570 --> 27:04.930
addressed by Mr Grocock.

27:24.490 --> 27:25.490
Yes, he can.

27:26.010 --> 27:27.370
And he managed to do that
without getting any more

27:27.770 --> 27:29.450
blood or oil on his shirt.

27:35.450 --> 27:43.010
Yes it is. A mid-range 1.6 litre
Kia is 17,195. A mid-range 1.6
litre Focus, 17,200.

27:45.050 --> 27:47.850
For the price of the Focus
you can have a Kia

27:48.370 --> 27:50.330
plus £5 to spend on...

27:53.090 --> 27:55.890
£5 worth of things.

27:59.330 --> 28:01.650
There was a time when Kias
were cheaper than their European

28:01.690 --> 28:05.730
rivals because they were very nasty,
but those days have gone.

28:07.410 --> 28:09.050
This really is not nasty at all.

28:09.730 --> 28:11.370
I think it is
good looking on the outside,

28:11.530 --> 28:13.210
good looking on the inside as well.

28:13.850 --> 28:16.090
It has sophisticated independent
rear suspension

28:16.650 --> 28:20.570
so you can stick it into a corner
pretty confident that you

28:20.930 --> 28:22.610
will come out OK on the other side.

28:24.010 --> 28:25.090
It is well-equipped.

28:25.650 --> 28:31.250
And it has passed nearly all
of our tests with flying colours.

28:32.010 --> 28:37.050
The Kia Cee'd - good enough
for Mr Grocock and good enough
for Top Gear.

28:47.570 --> 28:53.450
Very thorough. Very, very thorough.
A lot of information there.

28:54.410 --> 28:55.650
A lot of important information.

28:56.570 --> 28:59.370
Yes, absolutely,
but for me the most impressive thing-
was that parking system. I know.

28:59.770 --> 29:00.730
That is uncanny.

29:01.370 --> 29:02.890
Although I should say in fairness
you can also get that

29:03.410 --> 29:06.770
system on Fords and Volkswagens
and Toyotas these days.

29:08.130 --> 29:10.650
Yes, anyway, between you
and Mr Grocock, Eric Clapton...

29:11.330 --> 29:12.290
Brue Willis...

29:12.690 --> 29:14.930
and Matt LeBlanc, that is the Kia
completely covered.

29:15.450 --> 29:16.570
No, not quite,

29:17.330 --> 29:20.570
because there is one more important-
question we have to deal with.

29:21.370 --> 29:24.010
Is there?
Is it, "Can a badger drive it?"

29:25.250 --> 29:26.650
That is a good idea, but no.

29:27.170 --> 29:29.690
It is, "Can you play rugby in it?"
Rugby?

29:30.210 --> 29:32.290
Yes, rugby. If you are watching
in America, rugby is

29:33.210 --> 29:35.290
a bit like American football
only it's played by men.

29:37.770 --> 29:39.571
And you are going to try
and play it in a car?

29:40.250 --> 29:41.650
Yes, it is one of the most
ambitious

29:41.730 --> 29:44.530
things we have ever attempted and
we will see how it does later on.

29:45.330 --> 29:48.290
Now, though, it is time to put
a star in our reasonably priced car.

29:49.650 --> 29:51.650
My guest tonight is a young
chap from Hertfordshire

29:51.850 --> 29:54.250
who recently got a new Mercedes
and wants to come and tell us

29:54.570 --> 29:57.370
all about it. Normally
we would tell him to get lost.

29:58.050 --> 30:01.130
But we decided to make
an exception on this occasion

30:01.530 --> 30:02.770
because...

30:03.690 --> 30:06.210
his name, ladies and gentlemen,
is Lewis Hamilton.

30:11.930 --> 30:15.290
Great! You are back. You are back.
Good to see you.

30:15.690 --> 30:17.650
Lewis is among us.

30:20.090 --> 30:26.010
Have a seat. Have a seat.
It feels good to be back. Luxury.

30:27.210 --> 30:29.450
Obviously the first question
is the big one.

30:30.210 --> 30:32.890
You have moved from McLaren
to Mercedes.

30:34.530 --> 30:38.170
Is that not a bit like moving
from Manchester United to West Ham?

30:40.650 --> 30:43.570
Firstly, thanks for
the warm welcome, everyone.
Don't change the subject.

30:44.410 --> 30:45.490
Good to be back.

30:46.330 --> 30:48.410
Yes, no, it's a big change for me
obviously,

30:49.050 --> 30:50.330
but I'm really excited about it.

30:50.850 --> 30:54.050
Everyone is criticising it and
has their own opinions but for me

30:55.130 --> 30:56.930
I have been at McLaren
since I was 13.

30:57.490 --> 31:01.690
It was a long period there and I
wanted a change. I am a risk taker.

31:02.890 --> 31:05.970
There is a risk and a risk because
McLaren have won, what, 182 races.

31:06.490 --> 31:11.690
Mercedes has won... one in five
years. What makes you think...?

31:13.050 --> 31:17.010
Well, they won the Championship.
Well, it was actually Brawn...
Brawn. Technically not...

31:17.490 --> 31:22.410
Have they told you that? "We've won.
We've won." You are right.

31:23.650 --> 31:25.650
They have struggled
the last few years, but I think

31:26.130 --> 31:30.170
when the rules came out in 2009,
everyone came out with
the design of a car and

31:31.130 --> 31:34.050
they started out, and every year
after that it is an evolution of
that car.

31:34.170 --> 31:37.490
And they started off on the wrong
foot and they've been on the wrong
foot since then.

31:38.450 --> 31:42.810
One of the things I thought,
you had to do a lot of PR
work at McLaren, didn't you? Mm.

31:44.170 --> 31:46.010
Everybody knows that is dreadful.
Yeah.

31:46.650 --> 31:48.530
"Buy this terrible thing that
sponsors our car."

31:49.130 --> 31:51.811
Is there going to be less of that?
A lot less, yes. A lot less? Yes.

31:51.890 --> 31:53.850
That is good enough. Why did you
not just say because you have
to do less

31:54.370 --> 31:56.211
standing around talking rubbish?
It's not that.

31:56.290 --> 31:58.690
There were so many good
things about the opportunity to go

31:59.890 --> 32:01.970
somewhere where they are struggling-
and hopefully be

32:02.370 --> 32:04.770
a part of something that will get
somewhere and become great.

32:04.970 --> 32:06.450
Michael did it years ago
with Ferrari.

32:07.010 --> 32:09.930
No other driver has done that
really, so I want to do
something like that.

32:10.450 --> 32:11.690
So we needn't expect to see you

32:12.650 --> 32:13.730
leading everybody around
from pole position?

32:14.290 --> 32:16.170
You definitely should not
expect that this year.

32:17.450 --> 32:20.171
Because initial testing has not
been
completely successful so far? No.

32:20.650 --> 32:24.290
It wasn't good. Brake failure on my-
14th lap. What speed? Pretty fast.

32:24.810 --> 32:27.450
Yeah. I was at the end of the back
straight going into turn six

32:27.970 --> 32:31.210
and hit the brakes at 180 mph, 190,-
and then nothing happened.

32:32.250 --> 32:33.290
I just went straight in...

32:33.610 --> 32:34.730
So when you
put your foot on the brake pedal

32:35.130 --> 32:37.050
and you're going 180 and nothing
happens. Poo?

32:39.130 --> 32:43.450
No, you do swear though. You have
time to think of a swear word?
Yes, you do.

32:46.490 --> 32:47.890
And you have time to brace. Do you?

32:48.410 --> 32:50.090
Yes, so I was going
towards the wall and

32:50.610 --> 32:54.250
I remember just holding on for dear-
life knowing it was going to hurt.

32:54.770 --> 32:57.010
Did it hurt? It did.
Particularly in my legs.

32:57.650 --> 32:59.851
For some reason, I don't know,
I went in straight ahead,

33:00.010 --> 33:02.211
but my legs seem to hurt
when I go straight into a wall.

33:04.290 --> 33:06.410
Now, I do know what
I need to talk to you about.

33:06.770 --> 33:08.450
The handbrake in the modern car.

33:11.650 --> 33:17.090
Have you ever thought, "If I pull
this, she...?" I am sure I have.

33:19.170 --> 33:21.530
In the first years that
I was driving, I'm sure.

33:24.730 --> 33:27.330
We were discussing this earlier.
It is one of the weirdest things.

33:27.770 --> 33:29.170
We are all fairly clear,
girls don't like men who do

33:29.690 --> 33:32.490
handbrake turns, but we think
they do. My girlfriend loves it.

33:33.410 --> 33:36.210
Does she? I have a good
story about my handbrake turns.

33:37.570 --> 33:41.370
Years ago I was at a karting race
in Italy with Nico as my team mate.

33:42.450 --> 33:43.290
It was 2000.

33:43.930 --> 33:45.770
Me, my dad and Keke Rosberg,

33:46.290 --> 33:50.050
were on our way to the track
and my dad was driving down this

33:50.570 --> 33:53.251
country lane, which off the edge
of the road drops down into a field

33:53.370 --> 33:54.890
and there is a metre drop.

33:55.410 --> 33:57.490
Keke all of a sudden just pulls the-
handbrake while my dad is driving.

33:58.010 --> 34:00.530
And my dad doesn't really know
how to drive that well.

34:02.450 --> 34:05.530
He thinks he's a great driver...
He's not here to argue.

34:06.370 --> 34:08.690
Lost the back end of the car
and put it down into the ditch

34:09.130 --> 34:11.210
and we had to leave it there
and walk to the track.

34:13.570 --> 34:16.210
There wasn't even a girl
in the car?
Who was Keke trying to impress?

34:16.770 --> 34:19.570
I don't know. Your dad.
My dad, yes. Keke is gay!

34:26.130 --> 34:27.370
And on that bombshell...

34:32.810 --> 34:34.050
Now, I know that you have been
very much looking forward to

34:34.570 --> 34:38.090
coming back here. Yes, I have. You
have been here before. Yes, 2008.

34:39.449 --> 34:43.370
Now most guests do a lap,
take the weather on the chin,

34:43.889 --> 34:47.690
snow, ice, rain, and then go
away. You did not do that.

34:48.210 --> 34:51.690
You were cross, weren't you?
I was not happy that it was raining.

34:52.489 --> 34:56.570
It was wet. I am told that you
took our producer around the back...

35:00.810 --> 35:03.170
and a deal was done
that you could
come back and try again

35:03.570 --> 35:07.650
when the track was dry. Yes.
This was a bloody quick time. 1.44.

35:09.250 --> 35:14.450
And it was wet. Wet and oily.
Oily, was it? Get it right. Yes.

35:16.490 --> 35:19.810
Racing drivers' excuses, but...
I thought wet was all it said,
but it's wet and oily.

35:20.210 --> 35:21.131
Wet and oily, you said.

35:22.970 --> 35:24.210
You said someone in the last
corner dumped some oil.

35:24.610 --> 35:26.290
It had come out of Hammond's hair.

35:27.930 --> 35:31.410
Obviously, thorn in your side here, -
Sebastian sits at the top.

35:32.050 --> 35:33.450
That irritates you? Mm-hm.

35:36.090 --> 35:38.050
He's had the best car
for God knows how many years

35:38.410 --> 35:41.970
and is also the quickest on Top
Gear, so... You wanted to come
and do something about that?

35:42.170 --> 35:43.010
Every driver wants...

35:43.690 --> 35:45.450
I remember when Rubens
came and did the time.

35:46.290 --> 35:49.490
We went to a drivers' briefing
in Germany. He brought everyone
a shirt.

35:50.450 --> 35:53.530
He gave himself, "I beat The Stig"
and everyone else
"The Stig beat me."

35:56.850 --> 35:59.210
So you didn't do your lap today?
No.

36:00.010 --> 36:01.811
You came down
and did the lap many months ago.

36:02.490 --> 36:04.050
Who would like to see Lewis
practising for his lap?

36:04.410 --> 36:05.810
Yes

36:06.250 --> 36:07.450
Let's have a look.

36:08.850 --> 36:11.450
There he goes.
Second to last corner
catches all of our guests out,

36:12.970 --> 36:15.210
including one Lewis Hamilton.

36:18.970 --> 36:21.050
Was that me? Yes.

36:25.090 --> 36:26.770
I only put it on to make all
the other guests feel better

36:27.290 --> 36:29.050
because they are like,
"No, I have spun off."

36:29.210 --> 36:33.010
Now they can go, "At least
Lewis Hamilton did exactly the same-
thing in exactly the same place."

36:33.090 --> 36:35.730
Nevertheless, you then lined up
to do your lap again.

36:36.970 --> 36:38.930
- Who here would like to see it?
- Yes.

36:39.290 --> 36:40.290
Here we go.

36:41.490 --> 36:43.130
It is, of course, the old Liana.

36:45.610 --> 36:46.731
That was a good gear change.

36:46.970 --> 36:47.930
Come on, baby!

36:50.970 --> 36:53.050
Yes, we do not use
the Cee'd for Formula One drivers.

36:53.330 --> 36:56.810
You all have to drive that.
It's nice to see it back looking
tall and ungainly and slow.

37:05.690 --> 37:07.770
'I thought you were determined
to go fastest?'

37:08.330 --> 37:10.971
'I was.' 'Singing. It's like Kimi
Raikkonen looking at the planes.'

37:12.490 --> 37:13.570
Whoo!

37:13.970 --> 37:15.090
'Look where you're going.

37:16.970 --> 37:19.210
'Is this the sort of man who looks
like he's determined

37:20.130 --> 37:21.690
'to go faster than
Sebastian Vettel?'

37:23.010 --> 37:25.610
'Look at that, I didn't even
cut the
corner.' 'I'm very impressed.'

37:25.770 --> 37:27.890
Not surprised,
but I'm very impressed.

37:28.410 --> 37:29.930
'Here we go.'

37:34.010 --> 37:36.250
'That was to the cameraman.'
'I know.'

37:39.050 --> 37:40.450
'That was close to the tyres.'

37:43.370 --> 37:47.010
'A couple of bites at the cherry.
That's nicely done.'

37:47.810 --> 37:50.730
'It actually looks like it handles
quite well, bless it.' 'It does.'

37:51.290 --> 37:53.091
'And there we are, everyone,
across the line.'

38:05.970 --> 38:10.050
There is no point asking you where
you want to come. You know.
You know where you want to be.

38:10.410 --> 38:16.450
Well, Lewis Hamilton. Mm-mm.
It was a 1.44 that Sebastian did.

38:17.130 --> 38:23.130
Lewis Hamilton, you did it in...
one...

38:23.930 --> 38:25.890
42.

38:32.130 --> 38:34.770
Unbelievable.
Unbelievably fast time.

38:36.850 --> 38:37.810
Wa-hey!

38:38.490 --> 38:39.610
I will leave it there.

38:44.610 --> 38:46.410
You weren't even concentrating.

38:52.570 --> 38:54.810
Wow. Holy crap. Pleased?
I'm really surprised.

38:55.890 --> 38:58.051
It didn't even look like you
were concentrating. I was.

38:58.490 --> 39:00.050
It has been months and
you guys wouldn't even tell me.

39:00.570 --> 39:01.810
No, we never tell anybody.

39:02.490 --> 39:05.131
I was thinking to myself,
"I'm going
to be so disappointed in myself

39:05.370 --> 39:08.051
"if I didn't do
a competitive time."
Anyway, he has now hung himself.

39:11.210 --> 39:13.530
And obviously everybody here
is very pleased to have a Brit

39:13.570 --> 39:16.090
back on the top of the leaderboard.-
Yes.

39:16.610 --> 39:19.810
When I say everybody, there is one
man who is not pleased. The Stig.

39:21.610 --> 39:23.811
He knew about this time
months ago when you did the lap.

39:24.090 --> 39:25.290
This week he left the country.

39:25.970 --> 39:28.450
He went to North Korea to do
an experiment. We don't know what.

39:31.250 --> 39:33.490
So apart from him
everyone is thrilled.

39:34.130 --> 39:36.891
Ladies and gentlemen, the fastest
man we've ever had - Lewis Hamilton.

39:40.210 --> 39:42.290
Well done, mate.
That was worth coming back for.

39:42.690 --> 39:44.210
Without a doubt.

39:51.090 --> 39:52.490
Now, a couple of weeks back

39:52.850 --> 39:55.250
we finished our American road trip
at the Mexican border.

39:55.770 --> 39:58.410
The last one there had to cross over-
and test something called

39:59.090 --> 40:01.610
the Mastretta, which is a new
sports car being made there.

40:02.810 --> 40:05.210
Now, Top Gear is not
very popular in Mexico

40:06.130 --> 40:08.170
because of some comments
that were made on the show.

40:08.490 --> 40:09.730
And, unfortunately,

40:10.370 --> 40:12.210
the man who lost that race,

40:12.730 --> 40:14.370
and would therefore have to
go into Mexico

40:14.770 --> 40:18.730
and test the Mastretta was
the man who made those comments -

40:20.490 --> 40:22.290
our Director of
International Relations,

40:22.690 --> 40:24.490
Boutros Boutros Hammond.

40:38.050 --> 40:42.130
OK, so, here we are in Mexico
but it's all right,

40:42.650 --> 40:44.330
I have everything under control.

40:47.810 --> 40:48.490
You see?

40:49.850 --> 40:51.770
An angry Mexican looks in,
they'll see Jeremy,

40:52.290 --> 40:54.410
and they hate Jeremy
just as much as they hate me.

40:56.050 --> 40:57.410
Look at me!

40:57.810 --> 41:01.450
Power! Oh, everything's rubbish.

41:02.850 --> 41:04.210
Except, no, cos I am now Jeremy,

41:05.010 --> 41:06.810
so they'll still cut my head off
and then...

41:07.770 --> 41:09.571
I haven't thought this through
at all, have I?

41:10.370 --> 41:11.731
I'm not going to bother with that.

41:14.810 --> 41:16.330
OK, let's get this test over with

41:16.850 --> 41:18.970
as quickly as possible
and get out of here.

41:21.690 --> 41:24.490
'Eventually, I found a place
where no-one could see me

41:25.450 --> 41:27.810
'and I could get on with some
serious road testing.'

41:32.130 --> 41:33.250
So, what have we got here?

41:33.890 --> 41:36.130
Well, its full name
is the Mastretta MXT

41:37.050 --> 41:39.290
and this is the first
fully home-grown Mexican car.

41:43.170 --> 41:45.011
'Now, when most countries
make their first car,

41:46.090 --> 41:48.090
'it's something cheap
and practical for the masses.

41:50.090 --> 41:52.050
'But what the Mexicans have done
is skip the intro

41:53.410 --> 41:55.650
'and gone straight for a sports
car.'

41:56.890 --> 42:01.930
Any similarities between this and an-
early Lotus Elise are not accidental.

42:03.850 --> 42:06.090
It's small, it's compact,
leather bucket seats,

42:07.170 --> 42:09.130
suede-ish trim here and there.

42:11.050 --> 42:13.850
Steering wheel no bigger than
a tortilla, which is a good thing.

42:19.850 --> 42:23.770
'The interior, the chassis
and the body are all Mexican made.

42:24.850 --> 42:28.610
'But the 2.0 litre turbo engine
is actually from over the border.'

42:31.690 --> 42:33.770
It's a Ford and it makes 250bhp,

42:34.290 --> 42:37.930
enough to take the Mastretta
to 60 in 4.9 seconds.

42:40.250 --> 42:43.330
Which could be useful if, say,
somebody was trying to chase you.

42:48.490 --> 42:50.330
'Unlike some lightweight sports cars,

42:50.850 --> 42:54.330
'the Mastretta offers luxuries
such as air-con and a stereo.'

42:55.850 --> 42:56.810
Put the radio on.

42:57.490 --> 43:00.130
Oh, yeah, my favourite. I love this.

43:06.570 --> 43:10.930
'Despite the equipment,
the MXT is no fatty -

43:11.290 --> 43:13.690
'weighing in at just 1,050 kilograms

43:14.330 --> 43:17.410
'thanks to a chassis made
of carbon fibre and aluminium.'

43:20.010 --> 43:21.450
You can see how
they've tried to keep

43:21.810 --> 43:23.371
all the car's weight
between the wheels,

43:23.570 --> 43:26.331
which is why there is absolutely
no overhang at the back or the front,

43:26.770 --> 43:30.410
which is all well and good,
still not
sure about the styling, though.

43:31.210 --> 43:33.451
It looks like an Audi TT
that has been squashed in a vice

43:33.690 --> 43:35.930
and that's a good thing.
Very good. Morning!

43:37.130 --> 43:38.250
Buenos dias.

43:38.930 --> 43:41.730
The kind of thing Ferrari
could learn
a lot from. I shouldn't sit on it,

43:42.210 --> 43:43.770
I don't want to scratch it.
Look at that - sleek.

43:44.130 --> 43:44.970
Yeah!

43:47.730 --> 43:49.850
'The really good thing
about the Mastretta

43:50.650 --> 43:53.410
'is that it pretty much does
what it says on the tin.'

43:53.810 --> 43:55.810
For a simple, uncomplicated,
little, track-day car,

43:56.290 --> 43:57.690
you want it to feel like a go-kart.

43:58.610 --> 44:00.290
This kind of does.

44:01.650 --> 44:02.730
It does grip.

44:04.770 --> 44:06.810
I was waiting for understeer then,
there wasn't any.

44:10.210 --> 44:12.770
The gear linkage, always difficult
when the engine is behind you,

44:13.090 --> 44:14.050
works very well.

44:15.970 --> 44:17.490
'But it's not without faults.'

44:19.570 --> 44:21.370
The bonnet rattles about a bit.

44:21.890 --> 44:23.130
The windscreen wipers
occasionally set off

44:23.530 --> 44:25.490
for a wander
all on their own without being asked.

44:25.850 --> 44:28.170
The seals around the windows
are terrible, hence the noise.

44:29.730 --> 44:31.531
And it makes a hell of a noise
over the bumps,

44:31.650 --> 44:33.490
of which there are a few in Mexico.

44:35.410 --> 44:40.170
'At £37,000, it's also nearly
ten grand more than a Lotus Elise.

44:40.970 --> 44:44.770
'And, unfortunately for me,
the fuel tank is small.'

44:52.010 --> 44:55.770
Hola. Petrolo pumpo numero uno,
por favor.

44:59.130 --> 45:02.610
'Despite the flaws, inside
the Mastretta is a good little car,

45:03.290 --> 45:05.090
'just waiting to be finished.'

45:05.770 --> 45:07.971
The thing is, we have kind of
been here before in a way.

45:08.650 --> 45:10.290
James and Jeremy,
when they went to China,

45:10.690 --> 45:11.810
and it wasn't brilliant.

45:15.290 --> 45:17.770
First attempts never are but,
and who knows, with more time

45:18.450 --> 45:21.690
and more practice,
one day the name Mastretta

45:22.890 --> 45:24.850
might really stand for something.

45:34.490 --> 45:36.570
I think, on the whole,
that went pretty well.

45:40.330 --> 45:42.971
That car's been behind me
for a while
now. He's following, isn't he?

45:43.530 --> 45:45.050
That is... He's... He's following me.

45:46.290 --> 45:47.090
Yeah.

45:54.010 --> 45:56.250
Yeah, I know. Really?! Really?

45:59.410 --> 46:00.970
What? Were you just being nice
so you weren't beheaded?

46:01.490 --> 46:03.890
No, no, like I said, it is
genuinely quite a good little car.

46:04.130 --> 46:06.530
Once they sort out some quality
issues it shows real promise.

46:07.690 --> 46:09.410
Well, listen,
the hatchet is now buried, OK?

46:10.210 --> 46:12.290
I think, thanks to Ban Ki-Hammond,
we can now move on

46:12.690 --> 46:13.930
because, tonight,

46:15.010 --> 46:21.450
we are subjecting the new Kia
Cee'd to many, many thorough tests.

46:22.690 --> 46:26.330
And coming up now is the most
thorough test of them all.

46:27.010 --> 46:29.090
Can you play rugby in it?

46:31.970 --> 46:35.330
'Since we were being thorough, we
didn't bother with some minor
league

46:35.850 --> 46:39.490
'club ground but headed instead
for the home of English rugby...'

46:44.450 --> 46:45.850
'..Twickenham.'

47:02.130 --> 47:05.210
OK, I'm going to be captaining
the grey team and the silver team

47:05.850 --> 47:09.490
will be captained by a man who
knows this ground incredibly well.

47:10.690 --> 47:13.650
He drives past it almost
every day. James. Jeremy.

47:14.610 --> 47:17.530
Rules of car rugby. Yeah, and I've
got a question straightaway.

47:18.170 --> 47:19.971
Which is?
On behalf of the viewers, I suspect,

47:20.090 --> 47:21.490
don't you have to pass it
backwards?

47:22.010 --> 47:24.610
In real rugby, yes. That's not
possible. So, we're not doing that?

47:25.770 --> 47:28.410
Are we allowed to do this?
What, here? Yes. Yes!

47:29.330 --> 47:31.290
Has anybody said
"hallowed ground" yet? Not yet.

47:31.850 --> 47:32.971
Can if you want. Go on then.

47:33.450 --> 47:35.970
On this hallowed ground,
we are about to play car rugby.

47:38.730 --> 47:41.530
'In our game, the Cee'd
will be the speedy backs.

47:43.330 --> 47:46.810
'And up front, we'll be using
Kia Sportages as the hard men -

47:47.770 --> 47:48.850
'the forwards.

47:50.090 --> 47:52.050
'So, all we need now is a ref.'

47:58.970 --> 48:01.490
OK, are you ready, James May?
Yes. I'd just point out that

48:01.850 --> 48:03.970
the referee can't speak
and he doesn't know the rules.

48:04.090 --> 48:05.170
But, yes, I'm ready.

48:07.250 --> 48:10.330
'As team captains, Clarkson and I
were both in cars numbered four.

48:20.810 --> 48:22.650
And punt!

48:26.250 --> 48:27.930
Yes! They're reversing.

48:28.290 --> 48:29.970
Look, I'm frightening them!

48:31.210 --> 48:33.690
Argh! I've lost it.
Forwards, forwards.

48:35.930 --> 48:39.970
Here we go. May is ready
to go through the gap. Yes!

48:41.890 --> 48:43.570
Oh, it's still mine.

48:45.610 --> 48:46.450
No, I've lost it.

48:50.650 --> 48:52.570
Oh, look at this.
He's carrying it!

48:53.370 --> 48:55.330
He's picked up the ball
and he's running with it.

48:58.650 --> 49:01.610
'Bravely, James tried to
block my beefy forward.'

49:02.690 --> 49:03.850
I think we can get this back.

49:07.130 --> 49:08.490
Oh!

49:08.890 --> 49:09.128
Well done, men. Well done!
I'm loving your play.

49:09.129 --> 49:11.330
Well done, men. Well done!
'Then, grey five broke free.'

49:20.650 --> 49:22.570
Yes, I'm here and ready.

49:23.370 --> 49:25.330
Yes! Yes!

49:27.130 --> 49:28.370
Yes! No!

49:29.050 --> 49:30.010
Yes!

49:30.530 --> 49:34.050
Ye-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-es!

49:34.570 --> 49:35.530
What a try!

49:39.770 --> 49:42.450
Whoo-hah!

49:44.250 --> 49:47.170
'Having established the Cee'd
could score a try,

49:47.690 --> 49:50.210
'it was now time to see
if it could do the next bit.'

49:52.970 --> 49:54.930
OK, time for a conversion.

49:57.850 --> 50:00.930
Why does he do that?
Why does Jonny Wilkinson do this?

50:04.890 --> 50:06.130
Right, here we go.

50:07.650 --> 50:08.770
At Twickenham!

50:11.370 --> 50:12.210
Yes!

50:12.690 --> 50:14.810
No, no, no, no!

50:15.730 --> 50:16.410
Rubbish.

50:32.330 --> 50:33.130
Fall in, grey.

50:37.170 --> 50:38.970
Come on, winger! Come on!

50:41.170 --> 50:42.971
I should explain,
James May is using a diesel,

50:43.930 --> 50:44.930
it has a higher top speed

50:45.410 --> 50:46.810
than my 1.6 litre petrol

50:47.770 --> 50:51.410
but I have better acceleration,
less weight.

50:57.250 --> 50:58.770
Oh, no, this is bad. They're free.

51:00.690 --> 51:01.810
Come on, winger.

51:02.210 --> 51:03.170
Winger. Winger.

51:07.490 --> 51:09.570
Nice play, guys. Nice play.

51:10.930 --> 51:13.170
Ooh! Violent move there.
Must be James.

51:13.850 --> 51:14.810
And was.

51:16.570 --> 51:17.530
Keep it in. Keep it in

51:20.850 --> 51:22.410
A-ha! It's gone out.

51:24.370 --> 51:27.011
I think you'll find that's a grey
throw-in. What's a grey throw-in?

51:27.370 --> 51:30.011
This is a grey car. No, but your
bloke knocked that out. He didn't!

51:30.410 --> 51:32.410
He did! He didn't.
I'm going to go and ask the ref.

51:35.690 --> 51:36.930
Whose throw-in was that?

51:41.370 --> 51:42.491
Silver? Grey? Can you point?

51:42.890 --> 51:44.570
The worst referee I've ever
come across.

51:47.450 --> 51:49.970
I told James the ref had said it
was a grey throw-in.

51:51.210 --> 51:53.450
So now it's time
for our first lineout.

51:55.930 --> 51:57.730
This is a very useful
feature of the Cee'd.

51:58.370 --> 51:59.210
It's small, compact,

51:59.890 --> 52:01.850
so you can get a good run-up
for taking a lineout.

52:07.050 --> 52:09.690
Here we go.
And... a bit of wheel-spin and punt!

52:12.330 --> 52:13.570
Oh, push, push, push!

52:18.090 --> 52:19.451
I'm against the bigger man... car!

52:21.010 --> 52:22.250
Use that torque!

52:22.930 --> 52:25.850
Ah, they're only front-wheel drive, -
those Sportages,
but they have power.

52:26.970 --> 52:27.770
Come on, team!

52:29.970 --> 52:31.650
Where's the ball gone? There it is.

52:33.130 --> 52:35.650
James had the ball
and was heading for the try line.

52:37.010 --> 52:38.850
Dribbling...
What's it called in rugby?

52:39.210 --> 52:40.490
Running with it.

52:41.130 --> 52:42.930
But we soon put a stop to that.

52:45.010 --> 52:46.410
Ooh! Oh!

52:48.330 --> 52:50.690
So now,
my grey team had the advantage.

52:52.050 --> 52:54.170
Go, number 5. Go, go, go, go!

52:55.650 --> 52:57.330
Ain't no stopping him now!

52:58.010 --> 52:59.450
He's on the move.
He's in the groove!

53:00.650 --> 53:01.890
Yes!

53:03.130 --> 53:04.210
Come on, number three!

53:07.850 --> 53:08.930
That is a try.

53:16.010 --> 53:17.930
This is hopeless.
We're getting thrashed at this.

53:19.730 --> 53:22.410
Weirdly, my team let me
have another go at a conversion.

53:24.450 --> 53:27.410
Right, I'm going for a massive,
massive, massive, kick this time.

53:32.890 --> 53:33.730
Go over!

53:37.450 --> 53:39.570
Yes! Yes!

53:40.090 --> 53:45.010
It's a big
oooooooooooooooooooooone!

53:49.850 --> 53:52.090
At this point,
the ref signalled half-time.

53:55.050 --> 53:57.690
And, in the dressing rooms,
we had the obligatory team talks.

53:59.210 --> 54:01.810
Right, chaps, we are fine athletes, -
I think anyone can see that.

54:02.090 --> 54:04.610
But there is a lot we can
learn from actual rugby players.

54:05.130 --> 54:08.090
This was drawn up
for a recent match they played

54:09.170 --> 54:11.770
and this is what I want you to
concentrate on in the second half -

54:11.930 --> 54:14.570
mindset, go for it, enjoy it,
never give in, OK?

54:15.530 --> 54:21.010
And I think we can add a fourth
to that, which is ram James May.
OK?

54:22.050 --> 54:25.690
Ram him whenever you see him
and ram him hard.

54:26.090 --> 54:27.210
Really hard.

54:28.010 --> 54:30.211
Gentleman, I don't want to put
too fine a point on this.

54:30.490 --> 54:32.370
It's half-time, we're losing,
you're a bit crap.

54:32.810 --> 54:34.971
Now, when we're on the attack
we're getting very messy.

54:35.450 --> 54:37.410
Go up the pitch together
in formation,

54:38.290 --> 54:40.970
so we can pass straight up but be
ready to come back down again.

54:42.330 --> 54:44.130
Very important,
reversing if necessary.

54:44.770 --> 54:46.170
If not, you can get to the other
end

54:46.410 --> 54:48.810
and you can quite easily do
a handbrake turn around the post.

54:48.930 --> 54:50.650
Either side,
handbrake turn around the post,

54:51.690 --> 54:54.570
up you go again to the top and kill-
Clarkson. That's all you have to do.

55:01.170 --> 55:01.731
Any questions?

55:04.050 --> 55:06.370
'We knew, as the second half began, -
we had it all to do.'

55:06.690 --> 55:08.810
Right, my blokes need to
get in there and batter them.

55:13.650 --> 55:15.050
'The lads did just that.'

55:22.690 --> 55:24.210
'And soon I got a break.'

55:25.690 --> 55:26.850
It's a run!

55:29.290 --> 55:30.970
I'm coming in from the back!

55:33.050 --> 55:34.730
I know that's Clarkson
trying to tackle me.

55:37.050 --> 55:37.890
Yes!

55:40.210 --> 55:41.210
That's a try!

55:43.650 --> 55:45.010
Oh, my God!

55:49.610 --> 55:51.411
'Naturally, I elected
to take the conversion.'

55:54.690 --> 55:55.930
Please miss. Please miss.

55:57.730 --> 55:59.250
Oh, he's done it!

56:00.050 --> 56:01.010
Give me that!

56:01.530 --> 56:02.330
Damn it!

56:06.290 --> 56:10.090
'May's comeback wasn't
the only problem.'

56:10.850 --> 56:11.970
Oh dear, this hallowed turf is
starting to get

56:12.370 --> 56:13.770
a bit messed up, if I'm honest.

56:18.770 --> 56:20.690
'And things really weren't helped
by the scrums.'

56:32.770 --> 56:35.410
Oh no, it's... I'm stuck.
I've dug a big hole. I can't get...

56:40.090 --> 56:43.170
But on the upside, everything
was lovely inside the Kias.

56:44.810 --> 56:46.890
You see, normally when people play
rugby they get hot

56:47.410 --> 56:50.530
and they get sweaty but we're not
having any of that here.

56:52.010 --> 56:55.530
Got the air conditioning set just
so. I'm not hot, I'm sitting down.

56:57.570 --> 57:01.050
'Whilst I was distracted by the Kia,
Team May broke through again.'

57:03.290 --> 57:04.370
We're on the run.

57:05.330 --> 57:06.570
Stop him, somebody!

57:07.650 --> 57:08.490
This is what we want!

57:09.970 --> 57:10.810
Here we go.

57:13.130 --> 57:14.250
That's a try!

57:17.490 --> 57:18.610
Beautiful!

57:21.490 --> 57:25.290
'Worse still, James got a second
successful conversion.'

57:25.810 --> 57:26.770
Yes!

57:27.450 --> 57:28.850
'Putting his team ahead.'

57:29.490 --> 57:31.330
They are destroying us
in this phase of play.

57:33.090 --> 57:34.370
'With just two points in it

57:34.890 --> 57:36.770
'and the rain turning
Twickenham's hallowed turf

57:36.930 --> 57:38.770
'into a muddy skating rink,

57:39.170 --> 57:41.130
'the play became dirty...

57:41.490 --> 57:42.890
'and violent.'

57:50.850 --> 57:52.090
Classic rugby weather.

58:03.970 --> 58:04.771
I must say, viewers,

58:05.170 --> 58:07.650
at this point I have no idea what
Jeremy has said in this test.

58:07.970 --> 58:11.570
I can confirm, though, that
the Cee'd crashes quite well.

58:14.890 --> 58:16.130
Coming in for a try...

58:16.970 --> 58:17.770
Boof!

58:18.450 --> 58:19.970
Ooh, crikey, Moses!

58:21.050 --> 58:23.010
These things are built
like brick lavatories.

58:25.930 --> 58:26.730
'Which was good,

58:27.530 --> 58:30.130
'because on this surface stopping
was becoming a bit of an issue.'

58:31.970 --> 58:33.890
'Football, that we used to play,
car football...'

58:34.610 --> 58:35.690
Ooh, chit!

58:36.650 --> 58:38.290
'..Is well-suited to a...'

58:41.130 --> 58:42.850
Sorry. That was a total mistake.
My fault.

58:44.050 --> 58:44.890
That's not cricket.

58:45.690 --> 58:47.370
It's actually not that bad.
It'll buff out.

58:48.850 --> 58:50.090
'Despite some injuries,

58:50.650 --> 58:54.850
'all the Kias were still playing as-
the match entered its final phase.'

58:58.010 --> 58:58.970
Oh, he's on a run!

59:00.370 --> 59:01.610
Oh, come on, men!

59:03.970 --> 59:05.571
Pass it.
Don't try and get through. Pass.

59:07.290 --> 59:08.090
No!

59:08.490 --> 59:10.290
It's us! It's us! Go, go, go!

59:12.210 --> 59:14.050
Yes! Yes! Yes!

59:15.930 --> 59:16.650
Looking good!

59:19.130 --> 59:20.250
Oh, don't back up!

59:20.930 --> 59:21.730
Go!

59:25.210 --> 59:27.130
Yes! That is a try!

59:30.850 --> 59:31.810
Read it and weep!

59:47.090 --> 59:48.691
I think we've learned
two things tonight.

59:49.130 --> 59:51.370
Number one,
if you want to play rugby in a car,

59:51.890 --> 59:53.410
the Cee'd is brilliant.

59:54.090 --> 59:55.530
It's fast, it's agile
and it's tough.

59:56.010 --> 59:57.970
But, perhaps more importantly,

59:58.650 --> 01:00:00.730
we've learned that grass
is not a good surface.

01:00:02.770 --> 01:00:04.730
I mean, we've only played
one match here and look,

01:00:05.290 --> 01:00:07.810
the pitch is completely ruined -
absolutely ruined.

01:00:10.970 --> 01:00:12.850
They're going to
have to pave this over, really.

01:00:21.130 --> 01:00:22.490
Hold on!

01:00:25.770 --> 01:00:26.490
Hold on.

01:00:26.850 --> 01:00:27.690
Chaps?! What?

01:00:28.370 --> 01:00:30.050
Do you know why they call it
hallowed turf?

01:00:31.130 --> 01:00:32.250
Erm...

01:00:32.770 --> 01:00:35.450
Because it is hallowed.
Do you know what hallowed means?

01:00:37.330 --> 01:00:38.170
Temporary.

01:00:39.770 --> 01:00:42.730
Yes, yes, James. "Our Father who art-
in heaven, temporary be thy name."

01:00:43.690 --> 01:00:47.330
Oh, yeah. I do think we owe
everyone
a apology. Yes, you do.

01:00:48.370 --> 01:00:51.610
Because we've just shown strong
pornography before the watershed.

01:00:53.090 --> 01:00:54.610
Sorry, what?
All that handbrake action.

01:00:54.890 --> 01:00:55.970
Oh, yes.

01:00:57.770 --> 01:00:59.890
Every single girl watching tonight
will be cross-eyed.

01:01:01.930 --> 01:01:02.770
Good point. They don't see
two fat middle-aged men any more.

01:01:03.290 --> 01:01:05.290
What they see are Bradley Cooper
and Ryan Reynolds.

01:01:06.770 --> 01:01:09.250
I'm not sure the handbrake lever
is that effective. Yes, it is.

01:01:09.650 --> 01:01:11.890
And on that bombshell,
it is time to end.

01:01:12.570 --> 01:01:14.807
Thank you so much for watching.
Good night!

01:01:14.808 --> 01:01:42.763
