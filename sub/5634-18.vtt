00:01.627 --> 00:08.175
<i>It seems today that all you see</i>
<i>Is violence in movies and sex on TV</i>

00:08.258 --> 00:11.637
<i>But where are those</i>
<i>Good old-fashioned values</i>

00:11.720 --> 00:14.556
<i>On which we used to rely?</i>

00:14.640 --> 00:18.268
<i>Lucky there's a family guy</i>

00:18.352 --> 00:21.438
<i>Lucky there's a man who</i>
<i>Positively can do</i>

00:21.522 --> 00:23.232
<i>All the things that make us</i>

00:23.357 --> 00:24.942
<i>Laugh and cry!</i>

00:25.025 --> 00:29.947
<i>He's a family guy!</i>

00:34.868 --> 00:36.870
<i>We now return</i>
<i>to </i>The Price is Right,

00:36.954 --> 00:38.956
<i>now with male models.</i>

00:39.039 --> 00:43.252
Let's look at this beautiful
new car, presented by Ken.

00:44.878 --> 00:46.171
I don't want it.

00:46.255 --> 00:48.465
Peter, what the hell
happened to my underwear?

00:48.549 --> 00:50.092
They're all stretched out.

00:50.175 --> 00:52.094
Oh, sorry about that.
Me and the guys were using them

00:52.177 --> 00:55.013
to shoot crab apples
at Old Man McCratchen's truck.

00:56.139 --> 00:57.474
We don't want raisins on Halloween,

00:57.558 --> 00:59.351
we want candy!

00:59.434 --> 01:01.270
Hey, Quagmire, aren't you
gonna get in on this?

01:01.645 --> 01:04.690
I, uh, kind of got my own
game going on over here.

01:09.486 --> 01:13.282
All right, I'm off to get more underwear.
We'll meet back here at 2:00.

01:13.365 --> 01:14.408
Chris, do you remember your job?

01:14.533 --> 01:16.994
To try and get my shoes
sucked into the escalator

01:17.119 --> 01:18.120
so we can sue the mall.

01:18.203 --> 01:19.746
That's right, sweetie.

01:19.830 --> 01:22.165
I heard they're paying 50 grand a toe now.

01:27.004 --> 01:28.547
Ah, the train.

01:28.630 --> 01:30.549
Now that was the way to travel.

01:30.632 --> 01:32.593
- You remember that, Chris?
- Not at all.

01:32.676 --> 01:36.346
When did we go and get ourselves
in such a big damn hurry?

01:36.430 --> 01:39.558
Hi, uh, I'll take two tickets
for the Ladybug Express, please.

01:39.641 --> 01:41.351
Sorry, the train is just for children.

01:41.435 --> 01:43.687
Well, what about that guy in the front?
He's a grown-up.

01:43.770 --> 01:46.356
- He's the conductor.
- I don't see no orchestra.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.108
That's a different kind of conductor.

01:48.192 --> 01:49.735
Okay, well, if he's the conductor,

01:49.818 --> 01:52.321
why don't he have electrical tape
wrapped around him for safety?

01:52.404 --> 01:54.156
Also, a different kind of conductor.

01:54.239 --> 01:55.908
All right, thanks for
joking around with me.

01:55.991 --> 01:57.451
We're gonna go check out
the rest of the mall.

02:01.205 --> 02:02.789
So, I'm thinking
about getting my ears pierced,

02:02.873 --> 02:04.499
you know, big black gauges.

02:04.583 --> 02:06.543
Then, I can just work
at a bike shop forever.

02:06.627 --> 02:08.754
- Take the pressure off.
- That's a terrible idea.

02:08.837 --> 02:10.172
'Cause my lobes are so nice,

02:10.255 --> 02:11.423
I know, that's what everybody says.

02:11.507 --> 02:13.467
Wow, check it out.

02:13.550 --> 02:15.844
Biracial slam piece, dead ahead.

02:17.888 --> 02:20.349
What's going on with you, man?
That's a human being.

02:20.432 --> 02:23.393
Sorry, sorry,
my buddy sent me a bunch of Romanian porn,

02:23.477 --> 02:26.563
and now every girl I look at
I imagine throwing onto a table.

02:26.647 --> 02:28.982
Yeah, that wasn't really
the backpedal I expected.

02:29.066 --> 02:30.859
Excuse me, uh, Shelby?

02:30.943 --> 02:32.027
Hi, I'm Brian.

02:32.110 --> 02:33.487
Hey, I bet lots of millionaires

02:33.570 --> 02:35.364
come in here and hit on
you all the time, huh?

02:35.447 --> 02:37.533
Do we?
Do we-do we do that a lot?

02:37.616 --> 02:39.576
Yeah, I guess it happens sometimes.

02:39.660 --> 02:40.661
Did you want to look at something?

02:40.744 --> 02:42.037
Already am.

02:42.120 --> 02:43.622
Hey, can I try that on?

02:43.705 --> 02:45.874
Good taste. That's our nicest men's ring.

02:45.958 --> 02:48.418
Uh, better see if it'll
come off when I ski Aspen.

02:51.046 --> 02:53.173
Yeah, yeah, that works, that works.

02:53.257 --> 02:55.425
I know I'm a nerd, but I have, like,

02:55.509 --> 02:57.386
a thing for rich guys.

02:57.469 --> 03:00.556
I'll take the ring,
and I'll take your number.

03:00.639 --> 03:03.392
Here you go. Call me.

03:03.475 --> 03:05.769
What the hell are you doing?
That ring is $10,000.

03:05.853 --> 03:07.271
Relax, Stewie.

03:09.523 --> 03:12.234
All I have to do is bring the ring back
when she's not working.

03:12.317 --> 03:13.569
I'll get a refund and she'll never know.

03:13.652 --> 03:15.779
It's a perfect scam, like Teddy Roosevelt

03:15.863 --> 03:17.656
getting to be on Mount Rushmore.

03:17.739 --> 03:19.700
I won the Revolutionary War.

03:19.783 --> 03:21.785
I won the Civil War.

03:21.869 --> 03:24.079
I gained possession of Guam!

03:28.876 --> 03:30.127
There you are.

03:30.210 --> 03:32.212
We were supposed to meet an hour ago.

03:32.296 --> 03:33.630
Yeah, I'm almost done.

03:33.714 --> 03:35.007
I'm playing a really cool new video game.

03:35.090 --> 03:36.675
<i>Michael Douglas's Munch Out.</i>

03:36.758 --> 03:37.885
Nah...

03:37.968 --> 03:40.637
Nom-nom-nom-nom-nom-nom.

03:40.721 --> 03:42.890
Come on, Peter. It's time to go home.

03:42.973 --> 03:44.600
Not now, Lois.
I'm making ladies feel good.

03:44.683 --> 03:47.936
Peter, I've been on my feet all day.
Let's go.

03:48.020 --> 03:49.897
I'd stop, but
Catherine Zeta Jones' big hands

03:49.980 --> 03:51.064
are on the back of my head.

03:51.148 --> 03:53.483
You know what? Forget this. We're leaving.

03:53.567 --> 03:54.860
You find your own way home.

03:56.111 --> 03:57.905
What? Throat cancer?

03:57.988 --> 04:00.866
But all I did was drink Scotch,
smoke cigars, and this.

04:00.949 --> 04:02.576
All right, we can go, Lois.

04:02.659 --> 04:03.660
Lois?

04:09.416 --> 04:10.459
Mort?

04:10.542 --> 04:11.919
Oh, hey, how do you like my blowout?

04:12.002 --> 04:15.047
I'm pulling down so
much chotch, it's insane.

04:15.130 --> 04:17.925
I don't... I-I'm... Yuck.

04:19.134 --> 04:20.135
Lois?

04:22.179 --> 04:23.180
Oh, no!

04:23.263 --> 04:25.265
I'm alone and lost in the mall!

04:25.349 --> 04:28.060
I haven't been this scared
since the silence of the lamb.

04:28.143 --> 04:30.562
Hey, um...

04:30.646 --> 04:31.855
let's move in together.

04:34.733 --> 04:36.568
Say something!

04:39.363 --> 04:40.739
...and I turned around, and I don't know

04:40.822 --> 04:42.908
what happened to my wife,
and now I'm all alone

04:42.991 --> 04:44.117
and I'm just so scared.

04:44.201 --> 04:45.369
Okay.

04:45.452 --> 04:47.079
Do you want to go look for your wife,

04:47.162 --> 04:49.081
or you want me to finish the makeover?

04:49.164 --> 04:50.874
I guess we might as well finish up here.

04:50.958 --> 04:54.253
When I find her, I want her to go, "Wow."

04:57.256 --> 04:59.550
Lois? Lois!

04:59.633 --> 05:01.510
Lois!

05:01.593 --> 05:02.719
Lois!

05:02.803 --> 05:04.596
Is your wife named Lois, too?

05:04.680 --> 05:07.015
No, but I figured if
she's banging a guy like you,

05:07.099 --> 05:08.100
I got a shot.

05:08.183 --> 05:09.226
Lois!

05:09.309 --> 05:10.602
Hey, what're you-- Lois!

05:10.686 --> 05:13.105
- Lois!
- Lois!

05:16.608 --> 05:17.609
W-wait, hang on a second, Shelby,

05:17.693 --> 05:19.528
I can't hear you over my brokers.

05:19.611 --> 05:20.612
Buy! Sell!

05:20.696 --> 05:22.322
Buy! Buy!

05:22.406 --> 05:24.741
<i>Wow, buying and selling?</i>

05:24.825 --> 05:26.952
Yeah, yeah. Well, I'll see you Saturday.

05:27.035 --> 05:28.453
I better go; my helicopter's here.

05:30.622 --> 05:31.665
Are you still--

05:31.748 --> 05:33.750
by the way, you have no idea
what a helicopter sounds like--

05:33.834 --> 05:35.377
are you still keeping up this charade?

05:35.460 --> 05:36.461
Yeah, but it's perfect.

05:36.545 --> 05:38.839
Shelby's already off work,
so I'll just grab the ring

05:38.922 --> 05:40.716
and we can bring it back
before they close.

05:42.759 --> 05:44.970
Huh, I know I left the ring right here.

05:45.053 --> 05:46.680
If you're referring to the ring

05:46.763 --> 05:48.640
that I thought was a lug nut, I ate it.

05:48.724 --> 05:50.851
What? Why would you eat a lug nut?

05:50.934 --> 05:52.603
- I was dared.
- By who?

05:52.686 --> 05:55.147
By myself. I have low self-esteem.

05:55.230 --> 05:56.857
We should check in on this guy more.

05:56.940 --> 05:58.483
Oh, my God, this can't be happening!

05:58.567 --> 05:59.943
Chris, that was a diamond ring!

06:00.027 --> 06:01.653
Do you know how expensive that was?

06:01.737 --> 06:03.238
I'm sorry, Brian!

06:03.363 --> 06:05.866
But don't worry, it'll come out
of my body sooner or later.

06:05.949 --> 06:08.035
He's right. I ate a dime once.

06:08.160 --> 06:11.288
It became a manhole cover
for, like, three days,

06:11.371 --> 06:13.248
Okay, yeah, yeah,
we just-we just got to force

06:13.332 --> 06:14.499
Chris to poop, that's all.

06:14.583 --> 06:16.793
Yay! Like at a sleep-over!

06:16.877 --> 06:18.504
I love you.

06:18.587 --> 06:20.130
You're loved.

06:24.593 --> 06:28.013
<i>Attention-- the Quahog</i>
<i>Mall will be closing in five minutes.</i>

06:28.096 --> 06:30.891
Well, I've looked everywhere.
Maybe she left.

06:30.974 --> 06:34.520
Paul Blart, if you're out there,
I could sure use a miracle.

06:44.738 --> 06:47.950
All aboard the Ladybug Express!

06:48.075 --> 06:49.785
But be careful, Peter.

06:49.868 --> 06:52.538
If this train slows to less
than 50 miles an hour,

06:52.621 --> 06:54.998
then Sandra Bullock
has to marry a neo-Nazi

06:55.123 --> 06:56.959
and act like she didn't know about it,

06:57.042 --> 06:59.586
and then overcompensate
by adopting a black kid.

07:00.420 --> 07:01.755
Aah! Help!

07:01.839 --> 07:04.091
Holy crap!

07:08.470 --> 07:10.556
Wait! Don't close the mall!

07:10.639 --> 07:14.601
Like an actual Amtrak train,
this is dangerously out of control!

07:14.685 --> 07:16.603
That's legally defensible, by the way.

07:16.687 --> 07:20.023
On your screen is a list
of actual rail disasters.

07:20.107 --> 07:23.694
<i>A chug-a chug-a motion</i>
<i>Like</i><i>a railroad train, now</i>

07:23.777 --> 07:26.280
<i>Come on baby, do the Loco-motion!</i>

07:33.745 --> 07:34.955
Good morning, I'm Tom Tucker.

07:35.038 --> 07:37.040
Coming up, the secret to remaining upbeat

07:37.124 --> 07:38.792
after getting an elderly waitress.

07:38.876 --> 07:41.920
But we begin with breaking news
from the Quahog Mall,

07:42.004 --> 07:45.507
where a local fat man was stuck
overnight on a child's train.

07:45.591 --> 07:47.134
We now go live to the newest member

07:47.217 --> 07:49.678
of the Channel Five news team,
Dallas Portland.

07:49.803 --> 07:50.971
Thanks, Tom.

07:51.054 --> 07:53.974
Yes, quite an ordeal
for Quahog's Peter Griffin.

07:54.057 --> 07:57.311
So, Mr. Griffin, you were going
around in circles for 12 hours.

07:57.394 --> 08:00.397
Are you suffering any ill effects
from the centrifugal force?

08:00.480 --> 08:04.484
The wind on my skin is like "knifes."

08:06.570 --> 08:07.821
Oh, my God, Bonnie,

08:07.905 --> 08:09.198
are you watching the news right now?

08:09.281 --> 08:11.575
Yes, I'm so sorry about Peter.

08:11.658 --> 08:12.910
Oh, I'm sure he'll be fine.

08:12.993 --> 08:15.537
But did you see that
sweet, new piece of ass,

08:15.621 --> 08:16.788
Dallas Portland?

08:16.872 --> 08:17.998
Oh, I don't know.

08:18.081 --> 08:20.792
Why don't you ask my
index and middle finger?

08:20.876 --> 08:22.794
I thought this was a recovery day.

08:22.878 --> 08:24.963
No days off, bro.

08:29.092 --> 08:31.220
Peter, move, we need the TV.

08:31.303 --> 08:33.013
Is this... is this a coven?

08:33.096 --> 08:35.807
No, we're watching the news.
Now get out of the way.

08:35.891 --> 08:38.185
We had a bottle of wine
and a joint at Bonnie's house,

08:38.268 --> 08:41.313
and we want to watch Dallas Portland
before the buzz wears off.

08:41.396 --> 08:43.941
You chicken-heads are out of control.

08:45.025 --> 08:46.610
Yoga for men?

08:46.693 --> 08:48.904
Yes, says the inventor of Bro-ga.

08:48.987 --> 08:51.240
I'm here in his studio
above the Petco to see

08:51.323 --> 08:54.117
if I want to "nama-stay"
for the whole class.

08:55.911 --> 08:57.829
I guess he's handsome and funny.

08:57.913 --> 09:00.415
Oh, feel like I'm cheating
on Tom Bergeron.

09:00.499 --> 09:02.000
That's who you're all excited about?

09:02.084 --> 09:05.587
That chiseled Adonis with eyes the color
of summer's first blueberry?

09:05.671 --> 09:09.049
I don't know about none of that,
but look at that bulge in his shorts.

09:09.132 --> 09:12.594
I've never seen a bulge
in the front of a man's pants before.

09:12.678 --> 09:15.681
You see that, Peter?
That's the right amount of leg hair.

09:15.764 --> 09:16.974
My leg hair's fine.

09:17.057 --> 09:19.893
I have what they call, "The Irish Wisp."

09:24.940 --> 09:26.859
Why are we at a health food store?

09:26.942 --> 09:28.068
Well, we got to get that ring out of you,

09:28.151 --> 09:31.488
and this is a place where people buy
disgusting cereals to help them poop.

09:31.572 --> 09:32.990
Well, which one should we buy?

09:33.073 --> 09:34.408
I don't know, let's ask.

09:34.491 --> 09:36.869
Are there any gray-haired
lesbian art teachers

09:36.952 --> 09:39.246
who can help us select a fiber cereal?

09:39.329 --> 09:40.831
This won't take long.

09:40.914 --> 09:43.500
We know your large dogs
are tied up outside.

09:45.794 --> 09:47.045
There's too many of them!

09:47.129 --> 09:49.673
We've got to start a chant
so they'll file out into the street!

09:49.756 --> 09:53.093
All sex is rape! All sex is rape!

09:53.177 --> 09:56.805
All sex is rape!
All sex is rape!

09:56.889 --> 09:58.265
When I first joined this cause,

09:58.348 --> 10:00.309
I was just trying to get this guy to poop,

10:00.392 --> 10:03.270
but now we're this close
to getting sex outlawed

10:03.353 --> 10:04.521
in the United States.

10:11.069 --> 10:13.614
So, Peter, where are
your boyfriends tonight?

10:13.697 --> 10:14.948
I don't know. Where are yours?

10:15.032 --> 10:16.491
What the did you just say?

10:16.575 --> 10:18.327
I'm-I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sor... I-I'm just...

10:18.410 --> 10:19.953
I'm not myself tonight.

10:20.037 --> 10:22.873
Lois and all of her friends
are drooling over that new news guy.

10:22.956 --> 10:24.750
That Dallas Portland's a jerk.

10:24.833 --> 10:26.460
Don't even say that name.

10:26.543 --> 10:27.753
Tom Tucker?

10:27.836 --> 10:28.962
What are you doing here?

10:29.046 --> 10:30.255
Getting out of that wind storm

10:30.339 --> 10:32.257
that screwed up my hair
and loosened my tie,

10:32.341 --> 10:33.884
but also trying to forget

10:33.967 --> 10:35.719
how mad I am at Dallas Portland.

10:35.802 --> 10:38.055
You and me both, pal.
That Dallas guy sucks.

10:38.138 --> 10:39.932
Why, what's your problem with him?

10:40.015 --> 10:41.934
Eh, my wife's been creaming
her spinach over him.

10:42.017 --> 10:43.727
Yeah, tell me about it.

10:43.810 --> 10:45.562
Since he arrived,
our ratings have skyrocketed.

10:45.646 --> 10:48.315
They're grooming Dallas,
which means I'm on my way out.

10:48.398 --> 10:50.859
What? We can't let that happen.

10:50.943 --> 10:52.903
If that guy becomes the anchor,
every night is gonna be...

10:52.986 --> 10:54.488
Hey!

10:54.571 --> 10:56.740
Sorry, I still get a little
dizzy from the train,

10:56.823 --> 10:58.867
but if Dallas Portland's
on TV every night,

10:58.951 --> 11:00.869
my life's gonna be a living hell.

11:00.953 --> 11:02.246
You and me both.

11:02.329 --> 11:04.665
Without the news, I...
I don't know who I am...

11:04.748 --> 11:05.958
but what can you do?

11:06.041 --> 11:07.376
He's the flavor of the month.

11:07.459 --> 11:09.753
But wait a minute,
maybe if we work together,

11:09.837 --> 11:11.296
we can solve both our problems.

11:11.380 --> 11:12.506
What do you mean?

11:12.589 --> 11:13.924
Well, if he's the hot, young thing

11:14.007 --> 11:16.260
and everybody loves him,
all we got to do is make you

11:16.343 --> 11:17.970
hotter and younger and thing-er!

11:18.053 --> 11:19.388
And then they won't need him.

11:19.471 --> 11:20.597
Well, how we supposed to do that?

11:20.681 --> 11:21.974
Just trust me.

11:22.057 --> 11:24.017
When I set my mind to something,
anything's possible.

11:24.101 --> 11:26.186
That's how I got myself on <i>The Voice.</i>

11:26.270 --> 11:27.938
I'm doing this for my mother,

11:28.021 --> 11:30.315
who taught me to sing
when I was only seven.

11:30.399 --> 11:33.944
She was my biggest inspiration,
and she was...

11:34.736 --> 11:37.990
taken from me when I was 12...

11:38.073 --> 11:40.492
in a fatal car accident.

11:41.034 --> 11:43.745
She was my rock... my beacon...

11:43.829 --> 11:45.831
and this one...

11:47.165 --> 11:49.084
this one's for her.

11:49.835 --> 11:52.087
<i>So, tell me what you want,</i>
<i>What you really, really want</i>

11:52.171 --> 11:54.840
<i>I'll tell you want I want,</i>
<i>What I really, really want...</i>

11:56.300 --> 11:58.010
All right, Tom, if you
want to be young these days,

11:58.093 --> 12:00.929
you gotta do a wicked
awesome GoPro skate video.

12:16.486 --> 12:19.448
<i>I can't stand it</i>

12:19.531 --> 12:21.450
<i>I know you planned it</i>

12:21.533 --> 12:23.327
<i>I'm-a set it straight</i>
<i>This Watergate</i>

12:23.410 --> 12:26.038
<i>I can't stand rocking</i>
<i>When I'm in here</i>

12:26.121 --> 12:29.249
<i>Because your crystal ball</i>
<i>Ain't so crystal clear</i>

12:29.333 --> 12:32.461
<i>So while you sit back</i>
<i>And wonder why</i>

12:32.544 --> 12:34.880
<i>I got this...</i>
<i>Thorn in my side</i>

12:34.963 --> 12:38.217
<i>Oh, my God, it's a mirage</i>

12:38.300 --> 12:39.843
<i>I'm tellin' y'all it's sabo...</i>

12:54.566 --> 12:55.692
Bear Scares,

12:55.776 --> 12:58.028
<i>Latvia's number-one bear prank show.</i>

12:58.111 --> 13:01.114
<i>Now available in region 3 DVD.</i>

13:04.117 --> 13:06.411
All right, Chris, nothing's
gotten that ring out yet.

13:06.495 --> 13:08.372
That's why we brought
you to this fast-food

13:08.455 --> 13:10.040
roast beef restaurant.

13:10.123 --> 13:12.417
Uh, yeah, I'll take the Angus steak melt.

13:12.501 --> 13:14.086
I'm sorry, are you here
to poop something out?

13:14.169 --> 13:15.462
Yes.

13:15.546 --> 13:17.297
Okay, this line is just
for regular diners.

13:17.381 --> 13:18.757
You need to get in that line.

13:21.218 --> 13:22.970
Excuse me, is this the line
for people who need

13:23.095 --> 13:24.304
to puke something up?

13:24.388 --> 13:26.139
I think this is just the poop line.

13:27.599 --> 13:29.309
Cheers.

13:29.393 --> 13:32.354
You know what restaurant
we're talking about.

13:35.774 --> 13:37.192
Ah, almost time for the news.

13:37.276 --> 13:38.402
Mind if I join you?

13:38.485 --> 13:39.736
I thought you hated the news.

13:39.820 --> 13:41.947
I like it now.

13:43.198 --> 13:45.033
Okay.

13:45.117 --> 13:47.494
Good evening, Quahog, I'm Dallas Portland.

13:47.578 --> 13:48.829
And I'm T-Homie...

13:48.912 --> 13:52.207
with the news in your mouth!

13:52.291 --> 13:54.084
What the hell's he doing?

13:54.168 --> 13:55.502
He's crushing it.

13:58.839 --> 14:01.091
a burst water pipe in the pediatric unit

14:01.175 --> 14:03.552
of Quahog General results in the tragic

14:03.635 --> 14:06.096
drowning deaths
of four children and one nurse.

14:06.180 --> 14:08.056
News bomb!

14:08.140 --> 14:09.141
I know what you're thinking, right?

14:09.224 --> 14:10.517
"He's so random."

14:10.601 --> 14:12.102
Boy, I never realized

14:12.186 --> 14:14.313
how young and hip Tom Tucker is.

14:14.396 --> 14:16.773
Dallas Portland should just
pack it up and go home.

14:16.857 --> 14:17.941
What are you talking about?

14:18.025 --> 14:19.318
Wait, wait, quiet, quiet.

14:19.401 --> 14:21.236
Tom's about to tattoo
the word, "Coachella"

14:21.320 --> 14:22.654
on the bridge of his nose.

14:22.738 --> 14:24.156
Is that a thing?

14:24.239 --> 14:25.949
Uh, I don't know, Grandma,
sit back and wa--

14:27.159 --> 14:28.285
- He got his eye!
- Oh, God!

14:28.368 --> 14:29.703
What's wrong with you, Dallas?

14:29.786 --> 14:31.872
Never seen a guy so young and cool before?

14:33.165 --> 14:34.291
Tumblr!

14:36.043 --> 14:37.669
I've just received some breaking news.

14:37.753 --> 14:40.714
Channel Five News anchor
Tom Tucker has been relieved

14:40.797 --> 14:42.966
of his duties, effective immediately.

14:43.050 --> 14:46.011
Holy crap! They fired him? Oh, my God!

14:46.094 --> 14:48.013
Oh, well, now back to my life.

14:53.310 --> 14:55.395
Bear Scares
<i>will be back after message</i>

14:55.479 --> 14:57.189
<i>from state-run industry.</i>

14:57.272 --> 14:59.775
<i>Shirt.gov,</i><i>shirt.gov</i>

14:59.858 --> 15:02.361
<i>Is only place to get your shirt</i>

15:09.785 --> 15:11.328
Peter, you were the one who told

15:11.411 --> 15:13.997
Tom Tucker to try all that nonsense on TV?

15:14.081 --> 15:16.500
You realize you cost that man his job.

15:16.583 --> 15:18.210
Well, how was I supposed to know?

15:18.293 --> 15:20.170
Katie Couric went on TV
and stuck a tube up her butt

15:20.254 --> 15:21.338
and they threw her a parade.

15:21.421 --> 15:23.131
That was a colonoscopy!

15:23.215 --> 15:24.758
This is kind of your fault, you know.

15:24.842 --> 15:26.009
I mean, you're the one who was drooling

15:26.093 --> 15:27.386
over that Dallas Portland.

15:27.469 --> 15:29.263
I was just trying to get
that guy off the air.

15:29.346 --> 15:30.973
Peter, that's ridiculous.

15:31.056 --> 15:33.934
He's just some pretty boy
who doesn't mean anything.

15:34.017 --> 15:35.978
It's like when you watch
<i>Mad Men</i> for that chick

15:36.061 --> 15:37.312
you said was like a fat me.

15:37.396 --> 15:39.231
I said a young, fat you.

15:39.314 --> 15:42.192
The point is,
you've ruined that man's life.

15:42.276 --> 15:44.653
You're right. Poor Tom.

15:44.736 --> 15:48.365
Thanks to me, he's fallen even
further than Charlie Rose.

15:48.448 --> 15:50.742
Today on <i>CBS This Morning,</i>
we'll be talking about

15:50.826 --> 15:52.828
how much sleep you need to not be drunk

15:52.911 --> 15:54.454
from the night before.

15:54.538 --> 15:55.956
That's not what we're talking about.

15:56.039 --> 15:57.833
That's what I'm talking about.

16:01.503 --> 16:04.214
I don't know what else to do.
We've tried everything.

16:04.298 --> 16:05.799
Brian, the jeweler closes at 6:00.

16:05.883 --> 16:07.676
You don't have much time left
to return that ring.

16:07.759 --> 16:10.429
You're right. Well, we have no choice.

16:10.512 --> 16:12.181
We'll just have to take
a bumpy ride to the mall

16:12.264 --> 16:13.432
and hope for a miracle.

16:13.515 --> 16:15.392
You know, Brian,
this wouldn't have happened

16:15.475 --> 16:18.395
if you were just honest with women
and had an ounce of integrity.

16:18.478 --> 16:19.563
Don't pull rank on me.

16:19.646 --> 16:21.648
You ate a ring, you worthless tub of crap.

16:21.732 --> 16:24.067
Yeah? Well, who's gonna be fishing through

16:24.151 --> 16:26.820
a tub of crap soon,
you unemployed buttmunch?

16:26.904 --> 16:28.780
Whoa, whoa, let's calm down, guys.

16:28.864 --> 16:31.325
Shut up, you unemployed buttmunch!

16:31.408 --> 16:33.535
Okay, he found a burn he likes.

16:40.125 --> 16:41.293
What the hell do you want?

16:41.376 --> 16:42.503
I'm here to say...

16:42.586 --> 16:44.505
I'm sorry about what happened.

16:44.588 --> 16:46.089
Let me make it up to you.

16:46.173 --> 16:47.925
I'm the one who made you lose your job.

16:48.008 --> 16:49.301
I'll find you a new one.

16:49.384 --> 16:51.261
Don't bother. I'm washed up.

16:51.345 --> 16:53.931
Everyone saw what I did, and besides, I...

16:54.014 --> 16:55.807
I can't do anything else.

16:55.891 --> 16:57.935
I was born to be a newsman.

16:58.018 --> 17:00.354
me!

17:00.437 --> 17:01.939
That-that happened?

17:02.022 --> 17:03.148
Is that for real?

17:03.232 --> 17:04.441
That's nuts, but still,

17:04.525 --> 17:06.360
I-I want to help you
get back on your feet.

17:06.443 --> 17:08.487
Go home, Peter.
You've already done enough.

17:08.570 --> 17:10.113
Thanks to you, it's over for me,

17:10.197 --> 17:11.823
like Billy Zane.

17:11.907 --> 17:13.075
Billy, you're through.

17:13.158 --> 17:14.368
You haven't done anything in ten years.

17:14.451 --> 17:15.911
Yes, I have.

17:15.994 --> 17:17.871
I was in those electronic
cigarette commercials.

17:17.955 --> 17:19.331
That was Stephen Dorff.

17:19.414 --> 17:21.041
Aw.

17:25.254 --> 17:26.964
- How we doing on time?
- Less than a minute.

17:27.047 --> 17:28.340
How you feeling, Chris?

17:28.423 --> 17:30.342
No different, except I have
to poop from all this running.

17:30.425 --> 17:31.677
What? That's great!

17:31.760 --> 17:32.928
There's a bathroom down that hall!

17:33.011 --> 17:34.555
No time! They're closing the gate!

17:45.357 --> 17:47.442
- Hey, Shelby.
- <i>Brian?</i>

17:47.526 --> 17:49.319
It's coming!

17:49.403 --> 17:51.488
- Oh, my God!

17:51.572 --> 17:53.407
Yes, um, I'd like to make
a return, please...

17:53.490 --> 17:55.367
and maybe take you to dinner?

17:55.450 --> 17:58.495
Brian, I don't care
that I was diarrhea'd on.

17:58.579 --> 18:00.914
I care that you weren't honest.

18:00.998 --> 18:02.749
I care that
I was diarrhea'd on.

18:02.833 --> 18:05.002
I care a great deal.

18:09.840 --> 18:12.176
Sorry I let you down, Tom.

18:12.259 --> 18:13.552
Oh, my God, look!

18:13.635 --> 18:14.803
Up on the roof!

18:16.638 --> 18:17.931
Holy crap!

18:18.015 --> 18:20.475
Doritos Tacos is only for a limited time?

18:21.518 --> 18:22.769
And oh, no!

18:22.853 --> 18:25.189
Tom Tucker's gonna jump!

18:31.486 --> 18:32.905
Tom, I got here as fast as I could.

18:32.988 --> 18:34.573
So-so, what's-what's going on?

18:34.656 --> 18:35.949
It's over for me, Peter.

18:36.033 --> 18:39.411
If I can't anchor the local news,
I have no reason to live.

18:39.494 --> 18:41.538
Look, Tom, Tom, before
you do anything crazy,

18:42.915 --> 18:45.417
I have that exact same bathrobe.

18:45.501 --> 18:47.419
Hey, Tom, the camera's
gonna be on you in a second.

18:47.503 --> 18:49.254
Before you jump, could you just hand me

18:49.338 --> 18:51.840
this microphone, like you're
passing me the torch?

18:51.924 --> 18:54.468
- What the hell are you doing here?
- What am I doing?

18:54.551 --> 18:55.844
Getting an interview with a crazed jumper

18:55.928 --> 18:56.929
on the brink of suicide.

18:57.012 --> 18:58.055
This is huge.

18:58.138 --> 18:59.515
Wait a second.

18:59.598 --> 19:01.058
You heard wrong, Dallas.

19:01.141 --> 19:02.976
There's a jumper here, but it ain't Tom.

19:03.101 --> 19:04.353
- It's me.
- What?

19:04.436 --> 19:05.437
That's right.

19:05.521 --> 19:07.064
Tom was just trying to talk me down,

19:07.147 --> 19:09.066
and if there's a news story here,

19:09.149 --> 19:12.069
the only one I'm giving
it to is Tom Tucker.

19:12.152 --> 19:14.363
Here.

19:14.446 --> 19:15.948
Roll it.

19:17.241 --> 19:19.618
Good evening, Quahog.
This is Tom Tucker atop a roof,

19:19.701 --> 19:22.871
where a local crazy person
is preparing to end it all.

19:22.955 --> 19:23.956
Bonnie!

19:24.039 --> 19:26.083
Tom Tucker's back on the news!

19:26.166 --> 19:27.501
Oh, here you are.

19:27.584 --> 19:29.461
- Tom Tucker's back...
- I know.

19:29.545 --> 19:32.005
Honey, I'm back on TV.

19:32.089 --> 19:33.632
No, Billy, that's Tom Tucker.

19:33.715 --> 19:35.300
Aw.

19:35.384 --> 19:37.094
What's going on?

19:37.177 --> 19:39.513
Don't worry about it,
just get those pants off.

19:39.596 --> 19:41.974
Oh, your hair is amazing.

19:42.057 --> 19:44.893
Tell us, crazy person,
why are you doing all this?

19:44.977 --> 19:46.478
I'll tell you why.

19:46.562 --> 19:48.689
I'm doing this because
I ruined a guy's life...

19:48.772 --> 19:50.482
and I feel awful about it.

19:50.566 --> 19:53.777
It's the only thing I can think
of to make things right.

19:55.612 --> 19:58.115
Well, whoever this guy is,
I'm sure he appreciates

19:58.198 --> 19:59.575
what you're trying to do for him.

19:59.658 --> 20:02.119
I think I speak for all
our viewers when I say,

20:02.202 --> 20:03.495
don't do this.

20:03.579 --> 20:04.997
Please.

20:05.080 --> 20:06.540
Come down off this ledge with me.

20:06.623 --> 20:08.208
You got it.

20:08.292 --> 20:11.461
If that's what the most trusted
newsman in Quahog wants.

20:13.255 --> 20:14.256
Aah! Pigeon!

20:16.800 --> 20:17.885
It's fine.

20:17.968 --> 20:19.386
He landed on people.

20:25.434 --> 20:27.561
Well, I'm glad your crazy stunt worked out

20:27.644 --> 20:29.146
and Tom Tucker is back at Channel Five.

20:29.229 --> 20:30.480
Yeah, apparently,

20:30.564 --> 20:31.940
when he interviewed me up on that roof,

20:32.024 --> 20:34.359
the ratings were so huge,
they made him anchor again.

20:34.443 --> 20:35.736
That's great to hear, because...

20:35.819 --> 20:38.530
Lois! Lois!

20:38.614 --> 20:40.240
I-Is somebody calling my name?

20:40.324 --> 20:42.034
Lois!

20:42.117 --> 20:43.160
I don't think so, no.

20:43.243 --> 20:44.661
Lois, I'm rich!

20:44.745 --> 20:46.496
Now I think I do hear something.

20:46.580 --> 20:48.457
I should probably go see what he wants.

20:48.540 --> 20:52.669
I know I'm a nerd, but I have,
like, a thing for rich guys.

20:54.713 --> 20:57.466
Oh, boy, she's getting in his helicopter.

21:00.928 --> 21:03.847
Well, I'm big enough
to admit when I'm wrong.
