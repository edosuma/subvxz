00:55.197 --> 00:57.560
You can do it!
Get in to second!

01:01.632 --> 01:03.632
- Come on, guys!
You're giving this game away!

01:03.667 --> 01:05.337
Come on! Pick it up!

01:06.604 --> 01:08.406
Come on, Finney. Come on.

01:08.441 --> 01:10.441
Let's go. You got this.

01:15.184 --> 01:16.612
-Play ball!
-You got this, Finney.

01:21.146 --> 01:22.288
Strike!

01:22.323 --> 01:23.817
Yes, Finney! Nice, Finney!

01:23.852 --> 01:26.193
- Let's go, Finney.
Two more strikes.

01:30.298 --> 01:34.729
- Swing, batter, batter.
Swing, batter, batter.

01:36.799 --> 01:37.996
Strike two!

01:38.031 --> 01:39.833
-- Yeah!

01:51.880 --> 01:54.221
Eyes open out there. Eyes open.

02:03.364 --> 02:04.693
Oh, no. Oh, no.

02:06.191 --> 02:07.795

Hey, dude.

02:44.735 --> 02:46.405
Man, your arm is mint.

02:47.441 --> 02:49.342
You almost had me.

02:49.377 --> 02:51.542

You think you can slurp that

I don't think they can hear you
up in Boulder.

06:00.392 --> 06:01.831
Sorry, Daddy.

06:14.406 --> 06:15.911
<i>I don't know.</i>

06:15.946 --> 06:18.243
Everyone says Fonzie or Richie.

06:18.278 --> 06:19.981
Millie says Potsie,

06:20.016 --> 06:21.917
but I don't think anyone
should ever trust anyone

06:21.952 --> 06:23.787
who wants to grow up
and marry Potsie.

06:23.822 --> 06:25.624
I think I'll just stick
with my current plan

06:25.659 --> 06:27.318
and marry Danny Bonaduce.

06:27.353 --> 06:29.221
You're not gonna marry a
member of the Partridge Family.

06:29.256 --> 06:30.497
He's so crucial.

06:30.532 --> 06:32.796
I love his voice.

06:32.831 --> 06:35.128
It's new.

06:35.163 --> 06:36.569
What?

06:36.604 --> 06:37.933
The flyer.

06:37.968 --> 06:40.034
Mr. Yamada is
putting them up again.

06:42.808 --> 06:45.512
You don't think they're
gonna find them, do you?

06:46.647 --> 06:48.438
Not how they want to.

06:48.473 --> 06:49.747
Come on. Let's go.

06:49.782 --> 06:51.210
We're gonna be late.

06:55.480 --> 06:57.018
-- Come on!
-- Hey, come here!

06:57.053 --> 06:58.690
KIDS
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

06:58.725 --> 07:01.187
Fight! Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight!

07:01.222 --> 07:03.090
Fight! Fight!

07:03.125 --> 07:05.257
You think you're so tough, huh?

07:05.292 --> 07:07.028
Let's find out.

07:07.063 --> 07:10.163
I will pound you like a nail,
you scrawny little beaner.

07:10.198 --> 07:12.671
-Then do it.

07:12.706 --> 07:14.431
-Unless you're scared.

07:22.683 --> 07:24.683
Get him, Robin!

07:40.932 --> 07:41.964
Get up!

07:41.999 --> 07:43.196
Hit him harder!

07:45.332 --> 07:46.837
Come on.

07:46.872 --> 07:48.069
Holy shit.

07:48.104 --> 07:49.433
Let's go. Let's go.

07:58.378 --> 08:00.015
What the hell?

08:00.050 --> 08:01.984
-That was Moose.
-I don't care.

08:02.019 --> 08:03.887
Moose is a giant asshole.

08:03.922 --> 08:05.482
I know.

08:05.517 --> 08:07.022
But last year, when he made
your nose bleed...

08:07.057 --> 08:09.387
-Gwen.
-He had it coming.

08:09.422 --> 08:10.828
No one has that coming.

08:10.863 --> 08:12.423
-Finney, he beat you up.
-I know, Gwen.

08:12.458 --> 08:13.897
I was there, remember?

08:13.932 --> 08:16.361
I... I just don't want
to talk about it.

08:16.396 --> 08:19.199
Well, he was stupid to pick
a fight with Robin Arellano.

08:19.234 --> 08:20.871
He's the toughest kid in school

08:20.906 --> 08:22.741
since The Grabber got
Pinball Vance Hopper.

08:22.776 --> 08:24.336
I wish you wouldn't
call him that.

08:24.371 --> 08:26.041
Everyone called him
Pinball Vance.

08:26.076 --> 08:27.240
No, I mean...

08:27.275 --> 08:28.912
I know who you mean, jerk face.

08:28.947 --> 08:31.409
Even the papers call him
The Grabber.

08:31.444 --> 08:34.214
Just... I wish you wouldn't
say his name.

08:35.723 --> 08:37.921
You don't actually believe
that story, do you?

08:37.956 --> 08:40.187
-No.
-Because he can't hear you.

08:40.222 --> 08:42.255
He doesn't really
take kids that say it.

08:42.290 --> 08:44.356
-I know that.
-Finney.

08:44.391 --> 08:46.061
-I said I know.
-Then say it.

08:46.096 --> 08:47.293
No.

08:47.328 --> 08:49.097
Are you chicken?

08:50.232 --> 08:52.364
I didn't mean it.

08:52.399 --> 08:54.069
I know.

08:55.600 --> 08:58.502
The inner core is solid.
The outer core is molten.

08:59.505 --> 09:02.077
The next layer, called
the mantle, is mostly solid.

09:02.112 --> 09:04.574
However, the thin outer zone
of the mantle

09:04.609 --> 09:06.620
is partially molten.

09:06.655 --> 09:08.919
Next slide.

09:10.417 --> 09:11.955
The surface layer
is called the crust.

09:11.990 --> 09:14.727
It is solid and very thin.

09:14.762 --> 09:16.421
As the Earth separated
into layers,

09:16.456 --> 09:18.632
it began to cool slowly,

09:18.667 --> 09:21.327
but the interior
was still very hot.

09:32.978 --> 09:34.505
Hey, Finney.

09:36.377 --> 09:39.609
- See you at lunch.
I'll save you a seat.

09:58.839 --> 10:00.707
-- Hey, Finney.

10:00.742 --> 10:02.368
Come on out, dick weed.

10:02.403 --> 10:04.205
Not fooling anyone, noid.

10:10.675 --> 10:13.181
What you doing
in our bathroom? Huh?

10:13.216 --> 10:15.315
See the sign? It says "boys."

10:15.350 --> 10:17.218
Yeah, boys, not fags.

10:23.424 --> 10:25.831
Dipshits, move.

10:27.362 --> 10:29.362
Hey, Finn.

10:29.397 --> 10:31.034
What's happening?

10:31.069 --> 10:35.038
You know, just keeping on
keeping on, I guess.

10:36.041 --> 10:37.139
Uh-huh.

10:37.174 --> 10:40.538
Moose got some damn sharp teeth.

10:40.573 --> 10:42.716
Knuckles bled all first period.

10:42.751 --> 10:44.608
Wait.

10:46.854 --> 10:49.822
Fuck with Finn again...

10:49.857 --> 10:51.285
I fuck with you.

10:55.060 --> 10:56.796
You can leave now.

11:05.301 --> 11:07.202
Thank you.

11:07.237 --> 11:09.875
You're gonna have to stand up
for yourself one of these days.

11:09.910 --> 11:11.635
Yeah, I know.

11:12.704 --> 11:14.407
Hey, why'd you fight Moose?

11:14.442 --> 11:16.673
He was just shit-talking.

11:16.708 --> 11:18.510
Pretty sure he'd back down.

11:18.545 --> 11:20.182
-Nope.

11:20.217 --> 11:22.679
I was so surprised
when he swung, to be honest.

11:22.714 --> 11:25.451
I mean, did you have to?

11:25.486 --> 11:27.761
Looked like you really hurt him.

11:27.796 --> 11:29.796
I was just gonna
knock his ass down.

11:29.831 --> 11:31.226
Whale on him a bit.

11:31.261 --> 11:32.964
But that wouldn't draw no blood.

11:32.999 --> 11:36.869
In a situation like that,
the more blood, the better.

11:36.904 --> 11:38.266
For the crowd, you know?

11:38.301 --> 11:39.597
It makes a stronger point.

11:40.600 --> 11:42.776
I've seen<i> Texas Chain Saw</i>
<i>Massacre</i> Friday night.

11:42.811 --> 11:44.778
-You seen it?
-That movie's rated R.

11:44.813 --> 11:46.912
My dad would never
take me to see that.

11:46.947 --> 11:48.375
My uncle takes me
to the drive-in.

11:48.410 --> 11:49.981
We see everything.

11:50.016 --> 11:51.917
But, man, that movie...

11:51.952 --> 11:54.381
it's the best ever.

11:54.416 --> 11:56.053
Better than<i> Enter the Dragon?</i>

11:56.088 --> 11:58.550
-Well, okay. Maybe second best.

11:58.585 --> 12:00.618
You know, I want to see
a Bruce Lee movie one day.

12:00.653 --> 12:02.653
Like, um, maybe if it comes
on TV, you know?

12:02.688 --> 12:04.292
Yeah. Yeah, you will.

12:05.295 --> 12:08.263
Hey, um, you got time to stop
by my house after school?

12:08.298 --> 12:10.397
Is it math again?

12:10.432 --> 12:12.300
Mr. Johnson talks too fast.

12:12.335 --> 12:14.137
He doesn't explain it right.
Not like you.

12:14.172 --> 12:15.765
Can you walk me through it?

12:15.800 --> 12:17.437
If I get another "F,"
I'm suspended.

12:17.472 --> 12:18.944
Yeah, sure.

12:18.979 --> 12:20.979
- So,
when we subtract six from 11,

12:21.014 --> 12:24.015
we find that the value
of "X" is five.

12:29.550 --> 12:31.616
You wanted to see me?

12:31.651 --> 12:33.585
Gwendolyn Blake, this is

12:33.620 --> 12:35.686
Detective Wright
and Detective Miller.

12:35.721 --> 12:37.193
Miss Blake.

12:37.228 --> 12:39.327
They would like to talk to you
about something.

12:43.696 --> 12:48.039
Is it... is it true you're
friends with Amy Yamada?

12:48.074 --> 12:50.305
We have homeroom together.

12:50.340 --> 12:52.043
Is she okay?

12:52.078 --> 12:53.506
She's fine.

12:54.542 --> 12:56.542
You know what this is about.

12:57.677 --> 13:00.183
What did you say to Amy
about her brother Bruce?

13:00.218 --> 13:03.285
Just that I had a dream
about him.

13:03.320 --> 13:05.122
What kind of a dream?

13:05.157 --> 13:07.355
Just a weird one.

13:07.390 --> 13:09.225
What happened in your dream?

13:09.260 --> 13:11.359
He was taken. That's all.

13:11.394 --> 13:13.361
By a man with black balloons
in a van.

13:13.396 --> 13:15.297
Yes.

13:15.332 --> 13:17.134
- What else can you
tell us about your dream?

13:17.169 --> 13:18.795
Why? It was just a dream.

13:18.830 --> 13:20.203
Who else knows about the dream?

13:20.238 --> 13:21.831
Nobody.

13:21.866 --> 13:24.537
We found two black balloons
at the scene, Gwen.

13:27.080 --> 13:28.673
Oh.

13:28.708 --> 13:30.543
We also found
one black balloon at the scene

13:30.578 --> 13:32.347
of Griffin Stagg's abduction.

13:32.382 --> 13:34.811
And we never released
those details, so...

13:34.846 --> 13:37.154
So the question is, where did
you hear about the balloons?

13:37.189 --> 13:38.155
I didn't.

13:38.190 --> 13:40.685
I'm gonna ask you again.

13:40.720 --> 13:42.258
How did you know
about the balloons?

13:42.293 --> 13:43.754
What aren't you telling us,
Gwen?

13:43.789 --> 13:45.195
Either there's a leak
in the department, or...

13:45.230 --> 13:47.263
-Or what? I'm The Grabber?
-- No.

13:47.298 --> 13:49.265
You think I kidnapped
Vance Hopper last spring?

13:49.300 --> 13:50.662
Is that it?

13:50.697 --> 13:52.268
Vance got held back twice.

13:52.303 --> 13:54.072
I've seen him fight,
and trust me,

13:54.107 --> 13:56.767
he could kick the shit out of
either of you blindfolded.

13:56.802 --> 13:58.670
Gwen, watch your language.

13:58.705 --> 14:01.508
Yeah, I took him down 'cause
obviously I'm The Grabber,

14:01.543 --> 14:03.246
you dumb fucking fart knockers.

14:03.281 --> 14:05.281
Gwendolyn Blake!

14:07.252 --> 14:08.988
Gwen.

14:10.156 --> 14:11.716
What aren't you telling us?

14:16.789 --> 14:19.757
That sometimes
my dreams are right.

14:27.734 --> 14:29.602
There he is.

14:30.902 --> 14:32.902
What was that?

14:32.937 --> 14:34.574
Nothing.

14:35.775 --> 14:37.874
I'm staying over
at Susie's tonight.

14:37.909 --> 14:39.777
It's Friday,
so you know what that means.

14:39.812 --> 14:41.317
I'll look after Dad.

14:41.352 --> 14:42.912
I'll be home in the morning.

14:42.947 --> 14:45.090
And you better not eat
all the ice cream.

14:55.102 --> 14:57.366
♪ Play that thing
low and lonesome, boy... ♪

16:31.462 --> 16:33.066
I'm sorry!

16:33.101 --> 16:35.563
-Dad, stop!
-Hey!

16:35.598 --> 16:38.566
You stay out of this!

16:38.601 --> 16:40.568
-Gwenny.

16:40.603 --> 16:42.570
They came to my work.

16:42.605 --> 16:45.034
Why did the police come
to my work?

16:45.069 --> 16:47.212
I don't know! I'm sorry!

16:47.247 --> 16:49.038
- You need
to tell me what you know

16:49.073 --> 16:50.347
about this investigation.

16:50.382 --> 16:52.041
-Nothing!
-Tell me what... What?

16:52.076 --> 16:53.449
-Nothing.
-Huh?

16:53.484 --> 16:54.582
Nothing!

16:54.617 --> 16:57.519
-What?!
-Nothing!

16:57.554 --> 17:00.291
Hit me again,
and I'm dropping it!

17:02.053 --> 17:05.989
You drop that, and I will beat
your ass twice as hard.

17:11.733 --> 17:13.568
No, Dad!

17:13.603 --> 17:16.109
That was an eight-dollar bottle
of goddamn vodka!

17:16.144 --> 17:18.606
-Oh, now you listen to me.

17:18.641 --> 17:22.071
