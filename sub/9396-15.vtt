00:02.035 --> 00:03.468
<i>Okay, here's the deal.</i>

00:03.737 --> 00:07.138
<i>Your new Council President, Brooke Davis.</i>

00:08.875 --> 00:11.105
I'm totally intimidated by this job.

00:11.277 --> 00:14.644
You're scared of what's in here.
I'm scared of what's out there.

00:14.714 --> 00:17.774
The whole time I was gone
I kept thinking about all this stuff.

00:17.851 --> 00:19.284
Like what kind of stuff?

00:19.352 --> 00:20.683
Mostly being with you.

00:24.457 --> 00:26.982
I love your brother, Dan.
Why won't you leave us alone?

00:27.060 --> 00:29.187
'Cause I didn't pay you
to fall in love with him.

00:29.262 --> 00:32.390
Only you and I know the truth about Jules.
Keith never has to know.

00:32.598 --> 00:35.727
-What do you want from me?
-I'm sure we can work something out.

00:35.802 --> 00:37.064
It's Andy, isn't it?

00:37.137 --> 00:39.469
-What can I do for you?
-Let Lucas go.

00:42.108 --> 00:43.200
Haley?

00:43.476 --> 00:45.808
I'm sorry, Nathan. She's gone.

00:45.879 --> 00:48.814
You realize I wouldn't be
in this situation if it wasn't for you?

00:48.882 --> 00:51.783
If you had stayed at River Court,
I would have never met Haley.

00:51.851 --> 00:54.615
You ruined my life, man.
You better watch your back.

00:56.000 --> 01:02.074

01:41.334 --> 01:43.825
So, you want me to tell you something
about myself.

01:45.038 --> 01:46.596
I don't have anything to say.

01:47.674 --> 01:50.575
Even if I did,
you'd be wrong to believe me.

01:53.446 --> 01:54.470
Trust is a lie.

01:56.382 --> 01:57.815
Nobody ever knows anyone.

02:01.087 --> 02:04.181
<i>What does a young fellow like you</i>
<i>do for recreational activity?</i>

02:05.291 --> 02:08.282
<i>I like athletics,</i>
<i>horsing around with my pals.</i>

02:09.461 --> 02:12.625
<i>I suppose most of the fellows</i>
<i>like to chase girls.</i>

02:13.399 --> 02:17.859
<i>-And does that go for you, too?</i>
<i>-No, sir. I have a steady girl.</i>

02:19.139 --> 02:21.437
<i>Some kids find it difficult, having a steady.</i>

02:22.609 --> 02:25.203
<i>But I don't. I guess the key is...</i>

02:25.278 --> 02:27.838
<i>just finding someone who feels</i>
<i>the same way you do.</i>

02:32.018 --> 02:34.077
In 1955...

02:35.088 --> 02:39.491
students at Tree Hill High School
created a time capsule...

02:39.559 --> 02:42.050
that was to be opened in 50 years.

02:42.128 --> 02:44.562
They were simply asked
to talk about their lives.

02:46.232 --> 02:48.792
Isn't it interesting
how things haven't changed much?

02:50.136 --> 02:54.470
Within the next week, each of you will go
into our converted supply closet...

02:55.642 --> 02:59.476
push the green button in front of you,
and videotape your thoughts.

02:59.946 --> 03:01.743
-Do we have to?
-Yes, you have to.

03:02.982 --> 03:04.040
I won't see it.

03:04.484 --> 03:08.181
Nobody will. Not until 2055.

03:08.888 --> 03:11.482
By which time, I'll be dead and buried.

03:15.328 --> 03:17.023
-Nate, you got a second?
-No.

03:20.066 --> 03:21.465
Are you looking after him?

03:23.069 --> 03:24.195
I'm trying.

03:31.611 --> 03:32.839
I need to move out.

03:33.413 --> 03:34.402
What?

03:34.480 --> 03:37.574
-I'm gonna move back in with my folks.
-Why? Because we kissed?

03:38.618 --> 03:39.846
Yeah.

03:40.220 --> 03:43.212
-Okay, you know what?
-And I want to ask you out Friday night.

03:44.891 --> 03:47.086
I talked to Karen.
She agreed to watch Jenny.

03:48.027 --> 03:50.257
That's kind of presumptuous,
don't you think?

03:50.463 --> 03:51.953
I don't know. You tell me.

03:52.732 --> 03:54.165
And, by the way...

03:55.301 --> 03:57.861
you smell insanely good today.

04:03.843 --> 04:05.435
Friday night, 8:00.

04:06.646 --> 04:07.806
8:00.

04:15.888 --> 04:18.288
Okay, first off, I want to say...

04:18.358 --> 04:21.952
happy 67th birthday to Peyton Sawyer.

04:22.028 --> 04:23.962
You were pretty cool back in the day.

04:24.030 --> 04:27.363
To Jenny Jagielski who is...

04:29.569 --> 04:31.400
like, in her 50s now...

04:32.572 --> 04:34.096
your dad sure loves you.

04:35.908 --> 04:37.398
Plus, he's a total fox.

04:38.778 --> 04:40.609
I'm not going to let him outfox me.

04:42.382 --> 04:43.406
My lawyer called.

04:43.483 --> 04:46.646
The state requires a mediation
before they'll let me remove Lucas...

04:46.719 --> 04:47.845
from Dan's care.

04:50.023 --> 04:52.491
But you know what?
I'm not gonna let him rattle me.

04:52.925 --> 04:56.486
I will present my case
calmly and rationally...

04:57.563 --> 04:59.053
and let justice prevail.

05:00.433 --> 05:02.060
You're wise to use the system.

05:02.935 --> 05:05.130
But just in case, I made some calls.

05:07.106 --> 05:08.164
And?

05:08.241 --> 05:12.075
If Dan's the man I think he is,
my guy should have something soon.

05:16.849 --> 05:19.579
-What's up, Ms. President?
-Please, don't remind me.

05:19.652 --> 05:23.110
It was really fun to win and all,
but now I actually have to do something.

05:23.189 --> 05:24.520
What was I thinking?

05:24.590 --> 05:26.854
You were thinking
that you'd be great at this.

05:26.926 --> 05:30.293
Everyone who voted for you, including me,
was thinking the same thing.

05:32.432 --> 05:34.730
But I got you something.

05:35.401 --> 05:37.266
A present for the President.

05:37.637 --> 05:40.902
A present? Maybe this was a good idea.
What did I get?

05:41.641 --> 05:43.905
It's the book where I found
the quote for you.

05:45.211 --> 05:48.840
There's a lot of great stuff
on leadership in there.

05:49.482 --> 05:51.473
Lucas, thank you. It's perfect.

05:51.884 --> 05:53.818
I also thought you'd like these, too.

05:55.121 --> 05:58.579
I am so warming up
to being the President!

05:58.658 --> 06:00.148
There's my girl!

06:00.293 --> 06:03.353
Boyfriend! Hi. How was your cruise?

06:03.429 --> 06:06.091
It sucked. Wasted time away from you.

06:06.499 --> 06:08.126
Yeah, even the topless beach?

06:08.868 --> 06:11.200
Imagine the buzz kill
when I found my sister there.

06:14.540 --> 06:15.598
What's this?

06:15.675 --> 06:18.303
Lucas got me a gift
for being the president.

06:19.045 --> 06:20.205
A gift?

06:21.714 --> 06:24.080
I was gonna wait and surprise you,
but what the hell.

06:24.150 --> 06:26.880
I'm throwing my baby a party
to celebrate. Friday night.

06:27.420 --> 06:29.650
-A party with presents?
-You know it.

06:29.789 --> 06:32.155
I so love being the freaking President!

06:34.761 --> 06:37.889
Congrats again, Brooke. I'll see you later.

06:38.231 --> 06:39.289
Thanks, Lucas.

06:42.068 --> 06:44.730
Okay. I'll let you guys make out.

06:47.540 --> 06:49.337
My name is Anna Tagarro.

06:49.542 --> 06:51.510
And I'm a junior at Tree Hill High.

06:52.412 --> 06:55.279
And since it's 2055...

06:55.448 --> 06:57.143
I guess it's okay to say that...

06:58.751 --> 07:00.742
I'm bisexual.

07:03.356 --> 07:06.086
AIthough, if I still haven't
found the nerve to come out...

07:06.159 --> 07:09.128
to my friends and family by 2055....

07:11.431 --> 07:12.693
Surprise!

07:12.799 --> 07:13.788
Surprise.

07:16.335 --> 07:17.324
Keith?

07:18.671 --> 07:21.970
-What is this?
-This, my beautiful bride to be...

07:22.608 --> 07:23.734
is your new home.

07:24.710 --> 07:25.870
You bought a house?

07:27.413 --> 07:31.076
Keith, you can't just buy me a house.
This is too much.

07:31.150 --> 07:32.674
It's not too much.

07:34.020 --> 07:35.954
The truth is, it's not nearly enough.

07:38.524 --> 07:39.650
I love you, Jules.

07:43.496 --> 07:46.056
<i>Service department,please pick up Line 1.</i>

07:46.265 --> 07:47.527
Nate.

07:49.235 --> 07:50.224
How you been?

07:50.903 --> 07:53.736
Drunk. Bitter. Kind of like Mom.

07:58.744 --> 08:00.905
I want to apologize to you, Son.
Man to man.

08:02.682 --> 08:04.877
That was a hell of a punch
you hit me with.

08:06.519 --> 08:08.384
I guess I probably had it coming.

08:08.855 --> 08:09.844
Okay.

08:09.922 --> 08:13.858
Nate, don't shut me out, or your brother.

08:13.926 --> 08:16.087
Especially since
we're all working together now.

08:23.069 --> 08:25.560
Nice try, Dad. It's not that easy.

08:26.873 --> 08:27.897
I quit.

08:40.186 --> 08:42.245
My best friend Haley left town recently.

08:43.589 --> 08:44.783
And it's been hard.

08:48.127 --> 08:52.325
Until this year it's always been us
against the world.

08:52.965 --> 08:57.425
We pretty much grew up together
and now she's just gone.

09:00.640 --> 09:02.904
I understand the leaving part.

09:04.477 --> 09:05.569
Trust me.

09:08.214 --> 09:11.274
I just wish she would've called me
before she left.

09:12.585 --> 09:15.179
I wish I could have talked to her about it.

09:16.889 --> 09:18.254
Not to change her mind...

09:20.426 --> 09:21.757
or tell her what to do...

09:22.094 --> 09:25.962
but just to say, I love you.

09:27.466 --> 09:28.797
And I'll miss you.

09:32.071 --> 09:33.299
Just to say goodbye.

09:38.277 --> 09:39.505
Nathan?

09:42.181 --> 09:44.149
-What are you doing?
-Haley hates pink.

09:45.484 --> 09:46.883
Yeah. So?

09:50.790 --> 09:53.156
Nate, Haley's my best friend.

09:54.026 --> 09:58.520
I know it's not the same,
but I get what you're going through.

10:02.301 --> 10:03.700
-A clown.
-Yeah.

10:04.904 --> 10:06.132
They creep her out.

10:07.807 --> 10:09.968
-Man, you've got to call her.
-I did that.

10:11.377 --> 10:12.435
I got her voicemail.

10:12.712 --> 10:13.838
Voicemail.

10:14.347 --> 10:16.315
I hope you don't still got that crap.

10:16.549 --> 10:19.848
So, you're having sex
with Jake Jagielski tonight.

10:20.052 --> 10:23.215
-Brooke. It's our first date.
-Please.

10:23.656 --> 10:26.318
You are sharing a bed. You have history.

10:26.392 --> 10:28.053
He's clearly experienced.

10:28.327 --> 10:30.727
See Skanky Ho, otherwise known as Nicki.

10:32.932 --> 10:36.993
Seriously, though. Sex, you, tonight.
I have to go.

10:37.703 --> 10:38.692
Wait.

10:40.673 --> 10:41.731
Which one?

10:41.807 --> 10:46.005
Black bra, black sweater, leather jacket,
Calvins, condoms, underwear optional.

10:46.746 --> 10:49.010
-Have fun.
-Brooke.

10:51.384 --> 10:54.683
You don't think I'm crazy
for wanting to take it slow, do you?

10:55.421 --> 10:57.981
No. I don't think you're crazy.

10:58.758 --> 11:00.282
Now he might.

11:01.427 --> 11:03.657
You'll be fine. You've got good hips.

11:04.463 --> 11:05.930
I'll see you at the party.

11:08.100 --> 11:10.933
Fifty years? Okay.

11:11.237 --> 11:14.104
If you're young and you're watching this...

11:14.173 --> 11:16.471
you guys know what you're up against.

11:17.209 --> 11:18.733
Especially if you're a girl.

11:18.911 --> 11:21.277
It's sex, right?

11:22.114 --> 11:25.743
Even 50 years from now,
I'm guessing it's still a really big deal.

11:26.786 --> 11:29.755
It's awkward and threatening.

11:30.589 --> 11:31.681
And thrilling.

11:32.558 --> 11:35.959
But, in a way, it's like sex is the easy part.

11:38.230 --> 11:42.132
Giving your heart to somebody,
that's the scary part.

11:43.202 --> 11:44.260
Trust me.

11:45.271 --> 11:47.637
I understand this mediation is a formality.

11:47.873 --> 11:51.468
But, in my defense, I'm providing a safe
and stable environment for Lucas.

11:52.178 --> 11:53.611
Two-parent. Loving.

11:54.914 --> 11:58.350
That said, I understand sometimes
things aren't always as they appear.

11:59.351 --> 12:01.251
-Your name is Roger?
-Doug.

12:01.787 --> 12:02.776
Doug.

12:04.457 --> 12:07.187
Doug, I'm not sure there's a courtroom
in the country...

12:07.259 --> 12:10.660
that would have a problem with the home
I've made for my firstborn son.

12:10.730 --> 12:14.063
Yeah, of course, Dan,
but I do have a couple questions.

12:14.767 --> 12:18.100
Can you tell me why you've never paid
any child support to Karen...

12:18.170 --> 12:20.104
or offered any financial help for Lucas?

12:20.639 --> 12:21.799
I did offer.

12:22.108 --> 12:24.975
But Lucas' mother forbid my involvement.

12:25.111 --> 12:27.602
-Financially and otherwise.
-I see.

12:27.680 --> 12:28.738
Ass!

12:29.749 --> 12:32.047
-I'm sorry.
-He's an ass.

12:32.752 --> 12:33.810
Okay.

12:33.886 --> 12:37.549
I didn't take his money,
because to him money is power.

12:37.623 --> 12:40.091
And power is control.
And he would have used it...

12:40.159 --> 12:43.060
in the same manipulative manner
that he always does.

12:43.329 --> 12:46.355
Lucas is my son,
and he has been every day of his life!

12:46.432 --> 12:49.526
And there's not a court
in this country, Dan...

12:49.602 --> 12:52.765
that's going to fall for your ass of a suit...

12:52.838 --> 12:57.298
and your crooked-ass smile
and your assey frat-boy haircut!

13:07.553 --> 13:08.781
Lucas.

13:10.156 --> 13:11.589
Where do you want to live?

13:18.063 --> 13:19.553
We've got a baby here.

13:19.632 --> 13:22.157
I'm sorry. I lost track of the time.

13:22.401 --> 13:24.835
That's all right.
Me and Jenny have been bonding.

13:29.308 --> 13:30.468
Go to sleep.

13:33.078 --> 13:34.067
How'd it go?

13:36.615 --> 13:37.843
He chose his father.

13:50.362 --> 13:51.590
We're gonna fix this.

13:54.066 --> 13:55.465
I promise you.

13:56.368 --> 13:57.357
Come here.

13:58.871 --> 14:00.270
Promise.

14:03.342 --> 14:04.434
Oh, God.

14:08.447 --> 14:10.039
That's my girl.

14:10.649 --> 14:11.741
Hi.

14:12.218 --> 14:14.652
So, I love a party...

14:15.087 --> 14:17.954
but do I know any of these people?

14:18.858 --> 14:20.849
Sure. Look, there's Mouth.

14:25.798 --> 14:27.766
-Hi.
-Hey.

14:29.001 --> 14:31.868
So, everybody looks really drunk.

14:32.137 --> 14:34.867
No, most of them are just stoned.
Come on.

14:37.042 --> 14:38.134
You go.

14:38.978 --> 14:41.173
I'm gonna find a drink.

14:41.814 --> 14:44.009
Okay. In the tub.

14:46.819 --> 14:47.808
Sorry.

14:55.227 --> 14:57.058
Erica Marsh?

14:57.730 --> 14:59.061
Erica?

14:59.865 --> 15:01.355
Brooke, congratulations.

15:03.435 --> 15:04.663
Do you drink?

15:05.337 --> 15:06.531
I do now.

15:06.605 --> 15:10.701
Besides, you said
I should find other activities.

15:10.776 --> 15:13.711
Yeah, I meant, like...

15:13.779 --> 15:16.714
Pep Club, not Beer Bong Club.

15:17.416 --> 15:19.646
Come on, Marsh! We're doing shots!

15:20.719 --> 15:21.845
Who is that guy?

15:22.254 --> 15:23.551
I don't know.

15:23.889 --> 15:25.789
But he called me by my last name.

15:25.858 --> 15:27.689
How great is that?

15:32.932 --> 15:34.524
Nate, thank you for coming.

15:34.900 --> 15:36.765
Whatever. I just ran out of alcohol.

15:41.073 --> 15:43.132
What did you say
in the time capsule, Luke?

15:44.376 --> 15:45.638
Nothing, really.

15:46.478 --> 15:47.945
I didn't have much to say.

15:48.647 --> 15:49.636
I did.

15:50.883 --> 15:52.942
What? It's important.

15:53.118 --> 15:56.679
Someday the kids are gonna need to
know the truth about how it really was.

15:56.755 --> 15:58.916
I've pretty much been
with all the hot girls.

15:59.124 --> 16:01.217
Freshmen. Seniors.

16:02.094 --> 16:03.618
Yeah, it's good times.

16:04.596 --> 16:06.120
Currently, I'm dating...

16:06.932 --> 16:08.297
Brooke Davis.

16:09.268 --> 16:11.862
-What's with you?
-Nothing.

16:13.238 --> 16:15.206
We were just talking
about the time capsule.

16:15.274 --> 16:16.935
About what we said.

16:17.776 --> 16:19.107
Does it really matter?

16:19.345 --> 16:22.212
By the time they open that thing,
we're gonna be old.

16:22.481 --> 16:23.505
Maybe not.

16:23.983 --> 16:26.076
Sometimes they open time capsules early.

16:26.185 --> 16:29.848
When a building moves or there's a fire.
You never know.

16:35.627 --> 16:39.256
Nice wheels outside. A gift from Daddy?

16:44.169 --> 16:45.363
How's Nathan?

16:46.638 --> 16:47.764
Not good.

16:48.841 --> 16:50.274
I know it's none of my business...

16:50.342 --> 16:53.334
but that's your jacket
in Felix's room, right?

16:53.545 --> 16:54.637
Yeah.

16:55.147 --> 16:58.514
Nathan was going through the pockets
a few minutes ago.

16:59.852 --> 17:00.944
Thanks.

17:02.121 --> 17:03.281
What's going on?

17:03.989 --> 17:05.012
Brother stuff.

17:06.258 --> 17:08.920
Mouth, you're, like, in the A.V. Club
or whatever, right?

17:09.294 --> 17:10.727
Media Club, yeah.

17:13.565 --> 17:17.001
I said something in the time capsule
that I need to erase.

17:17.202 --> 17:18.999
You think you could help me do it?

17:19.471 --> 17:22.531
-Like, tonight?
-You mean break into the school?

17:24.943 --> 17:26.308
Anna, I can't.

17:26.412 --> 17:29.973
Mouth, haven't you ever done something
that you wished you could take back?

17:35.054 --> 17:38.490
Sure. Not too long ago, actually.

17:38.724 --> 17:40.783
What if you had the chance to erase it?

17:44.129 --> 17:45.255
Nathan.

17:46.632 --> 17:47.724
Stop!

17:48.133 --> 17:49.600
Move or I'll run you over.

17:50.402 --> 17:52.029
Give me the keys!

17:57.209 --> 17:59.939
-Nathan, you've been drinking.
-You just better hold on.

18:09.321 --> 18:10.879
Pull the car over.

18:12.191 --> 18:14.182
Don't be a dick and drive drunk!

18:14.259 --> 18:15.487
I'm not even buzzed.

18:15.561 --> 18:17.290
That's still an open container.

18:17.529 --> 18:18.518
Fine.

18:20.065 --> 18:21.430
What the....

18:36.515 --> 18:39.075
God, I love my life.
Think we can outrun them?

18:39.151 --> 18:41.051
Just pull over. Don't make it worse.

18:41.887 --> 18:43.081
AII right, Luke.

18:43.155 --> 18:47.148
Seeing as how I've already been arrested
once this year, it's been nice knowing you.

19:08.714 --> 19:11.512
Good evening, Officer. Buy us some beer?

19:19.158 --> 19:22.025
Okay, so, I'm a single father...

19:22.094 --> 19:25.530
and, until recently, a high school dropout.

19:25.597 --> 19:29.556
And I'm going on my first date
since my daughter was born.

19:31.236 --> 19:32.635
Am I a great catch, or what?

19:35.974 --> 19:37.202
Are you warm enough?

19:38.477 --> 19:42.345
That's good. Because I had to call in
a few favors to get the breeze just right.

19:42.648 --> 19:43.876
How about the stars?

19:44.049 --> 19:47.382
I told them not to go too heavy,
so it didn't look all movie moment.

19:47.452 --> 19:50.387
More than a million,
less than a billion, that sort of thing.

19:50.656 --> 19:54.183
You wouldn't think just a stroll
down the river would take much planning.

19:54.293 --> 19:57.160
What, are you kidding?
Romantic lighting...

19:57.863 --> 20:01.355
couples scattered about,
music in the distance.

20:01.500 --> 20:04.196
-You're just lucky I'm a cheap date.
-Yeah, I know.

20:06.071 --> 20:08.801
And I am lucky...to be with you tonight.

20:12.945 --> 20:15.778
You know, some guys charge extra
for hand holding.

20:15.981 --> 20:19.075
You know, some girls charge extra
for this.

20:31.597 --> 20:32.621
Perfect.

20:34.866 --> 20:36.128
Nice work, jackhole.

20:38.270 --> 20:39.965
You're the one who was driving.

20:41.039 --> 20:43.906
Yeah. Either thank me or shut up.

20:44.176 --> 20:47.111
Whatever. I didn't ask you to take the fall.

20:54.019 --> 20:55.714
Call for a pizza. I'm starving.

20:55.954 --> 20:59.253
You're hilarious.
Someone's got to bail us out.

21:00.092 --> 21:03.152
No problem. Call my wife. Wait a minute.

21:04.129 --> 21:05.118
Scratch that.

21:13.238 --> 21:16.105
Mouth, I really....
I don't think this mask is necessary.

21:16.375 --> 21:18.138
I just don't wanna get into trouble.

21:18.210 --> 21:20.735
I've never done anything like this before,
you know?

21:26.585 --> 21:29.019
What do you think? Can you erase it?

21:29.187 --> 21:33.749
I don't know. I gotta figure out
if I can take this thing apart first.

21:35.027 --> 21:37.723
Here. There's a coffee machine
in the teachers' lounge.

21:38.030 --> 21:39.657
This might take a while.

21:41.266 --> 21:43.564
So, it'll take a little longer
than you thought...

21:43.635 --> 21:45.535
but Lucas will come around.

21:46.371 --> 21:47.929
He was like a stranger today.

21:48.807 --> 21:50.832
He actually chose Dan over me.

21:50.909 --> 21:52.433
Karen, come on.

21:52.778 --> 21:55.303
There's more to this than meets the eye.
You know that.

21:55.380 --> 21:59.840
Then he's lying to me. He should trust me.
What's next, a life of crime?

22:08.393 --> 22:10.258
-Hello.
-Mom.

22:11.997 --> 22:15.489
Don't freak out, but I'm in jail
and I need you to bail me out.

22:15.567 --> 22:19.059
-What? What happened? Is it Dan?
-No, Mom, it's not.

22:21.273 --> 22:24.003
I was with Nathan
and we had some beer in the car.

22:24.309 --> 22:26.368
Lucas? Listen. Are you okay?

22:26.578 --> 22:28.341
-Yeah, we're fine.
-Okay.

22:28.847 --> 22:31.372
-You got a quarter in your pocket?
-Yeah.

22:31.850 --> 22:34.375
Good. Call the father you love so much.

22:40.492 --> 22:42.551
-What happened?
-She's not coming.

22:44.629 --> 22:45.618
Wow.

22:46.598 --> 22:48.156
Your own mom can't stand you.

22:53.538 --> 22:55.062
<i>Let's see, what else?</i>

22:55.941 --> 22:57.806
<i>There this new girl, Anna, who's into me...</i>

22:57.876 --> 23:02.609
<i>but I'm all, ''Girl, be patient, you know.</i>
<i>The Tim will get to you eventually. ''</i>

23:03.849 --> 23:05.111
What did he just say?

23:05.450 --> 23:07.475
Okay. I think I got it.

23:07.719 --> 23:10.415
Did that creepy Tim guy
say I was into him?

23:12.057 --> 23:13.046
Sort of.

23:13.425 --> 23:15.825
Okay, first of all, gross.

23:16.495 --> 23:19.896
Second, we shouldn't be watching these.
We're just here to erase mine.

23:19.998 --> 23:21.966
I know, you're right. Let me find it.

23:26.972 --> 23:31.534
<i>ln 10 years I'll probably be married</i>
<i>to someone like Marvin McFadden.</i>

23:32.010 --> 23:33.307
Who's Marvin McFadden?

23:33.378 --> 23:36.973
<i>Of course, you all probably call him</i>
<i>Sen. McFadden or something...</i>

23:37.549 --> 23:39.107
<i>but we just call him Mouth.</i>

23:41.386 --> 23:43.786
It would be really wrong
to watch this, right?

23:45.257 --> 23:46.781
Maybe just a couple minutes.

23:47.325 --> 23:48.758
Two minutes. Tops.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.525
-I know tonight's date was kind of--
-Perfect?

24:00.005 --> 24:03.497
Yeah. I guess this is good night.

24:04.443 --> 24:06.968
It wouldn't have to be
if you were still staying here.

24:07.045 --> 24:08.376
Okay, that's not fair.

24:08.447 --> 24:11.473
The only reason I moved out
is because if I stayed here we'd...

24:15.053 --> 24:17.817
never stop doing that.

24:17.923 --> 24:19.948
That's a problem, why?

24:21.560 --> 24:22.822
Right.

24:23.128 --> 24:26.825
I guess I could move back in. Come here.

24:33.171 --> 24:36.572
-Is she okay?
-She's good. It's cool. I got her.

24:36.641 --> 24:39.735
I don't think so, buddy.
It's Rosey Palm for you tonight, okay?

24:40.045 --> 24:41.307
Go away.

24:42.280 --> 24:44.271
Come here. Erica?

24:46.785 --> 24:49.151
Marsh. Call me Marsh.

24:49.921 --> 24:53.254
Okay, Marsh. Let's get you home, okay?
Come here.

24:53.525 --> 24:55.356
Come on. I got you. Here we go.

24:56.094 --> 24:57.789
Okay. AII right. Come on.

25:00.432 --> 25:01.729
What is so funny?

25:03.401 --> 25:04.390
You.

25:06.037 --> 25:08.232
Do you need me
to connect the dots for you?

25:08.306 --> 25:09.796
I just need you to shut up.

25:10.542 --> 25:11.907
When I first met you...

25:12.444 --> 25:15.277
I figured the best way to hurt you
was to take Haley away.

25:16.314 --> 25:17.747
Now she's gone, isn't she?

25:17.816 --> 25:20.011
Is it any wonder she left a stroke like you?

25:21.419 --> 25:23.944
-Look at yourself, you're pathetic.
-I'm pathetic?

25:24.990 --> 25:28.517
You're chasing after a father who doesn't
even want you, and I'm pathetic?

25:28.660 --> 25:30.389
Would you just let it go?

25:31.296 --> 25:33.924
Why are you so threatened by that?

25:35.367 --> 25:37.426
Afraid Daddy will like me more than you?

25:37.569 --> 25:40.197
You mean, kind of how he liked my mom
better than yours?

25:41.406 --> 25:42.395
No.

25:44.609 --> 25:47.305
I mean kind of how your wife
likes Chris better than you.

25:50.248 --> 25:51.715
You two, stop it!

25:58.356 --> 26:01.757
So, you're probably looking at this
and making fun of my outfit, right?

26:02.794 --> 26:06.821
Anyway, here's all you really need to know
about today.

26:06.932 --> 26:11.733
If you're fat, dumb, sexual, and a guy,
you're okay.

26:12.470 --> 26:14.768
If you're a girl, not so much.

26:16.041 --> 26:18.236
Please tell me that's changed in the future.

26:18.410 --> 26:19.672
Don't bet on it.

26:20.912 --> 26:23.346
<i>And somebody tell me</i>
<i>you've got love figured out.</i>

26:23.481 --> 26:26.575
<i>Because I've got news for you,</i>
<i>it's pretty darn messy right now.</i>

26:27.752 --> 26:29.720
<i>But I guess it's always been that way.</i>

26:30.288 --> 26:31.721
<i>Wanting to be loved.</i>

26:32.824 --> 26:36.225
<i>To find somebody</i>
<i>that makes your heart ache in a good way.</i>

26:36.294 --> 26:37.693
<i>To feel understood.</i>

26:39.331 --> 26:40.559
<i>So...</i>

26:40.632 --> 26:44.261
<i>if you're robots, or aliens, or something</i>
<i>and you're watching this right now...</i>

26:44.336 --> 26:46.201
<i>and that feeling no longer exists...</i>

26:48.974 --> 26:50.236
<i>you missed it...</i>

26:51.142 --> 26:52.575
<i>and I feel sorry for you.</i>

26:54.212 --> 26:57.045
<i>Because, as far as I can tell,</i>
<i>that's what it's all about.</i>

26:57.816 --> 27:00.114
<i>And that's what it always should be about.</i>

27:14.165 --> 27:16.030
Dan wanted revenge on Keith.

27:18.169 --> 27:19.864
That's why I'm staying with him.

27:23.842 --> 27:26.606
-Revenge for what?
-Keith slept with your mom.

27:30.248 --> 27:31.272
It's true.

27:31.349 --> 27:35.012
Of course it is. Nobody's faithful anymore.
Nobody can be trusted.

27:36.554 --> 27:40.684
Dan also hired Jules
to make Keith fall in love with her.

27:42.394 --> 27:43.952
That's outstanding.

27:45.130 --> 27:46.825
-What else you got?
-That's it.

27:47.532 --> 27:48.692
I stay with Dan...

27:51.936 --> 27:53.631
Keith and Jules get to be happy.

27:54.406 --> 27:57.898
Yeah. Until she sings a duet
and goes on tour.

28:00.812 --> 28:02.575
-She's got a dream, Nate.
-No.

28:03.815 --> 28:05.874
She left to be with Chris.

28:08.853 --> 28:10.514
She kissed him before she left.

28:12.190 --> 28:13.521
I'm sorry.

28:13.591 --> 28:15.616
That's what she said when I called her.

28:16.361 --> 28:17.953
-I thought you said--
-I lied.

28:19.798 --> 28:21.129
She said she was sorry.

28:21.533 --> 28:24.024
She said she loved me,
and that it wasn't about Chris.

28:24.102 --> 28:26.900
She just needs some time
to figure everything out.

28:28.907 --> 28:30.033
You believe that?

28:30.108 --> 28:34.010
Because if I love her, and if she loves me...

28:35.714 --> 28:37.181
what's there to figure out?

28:47.559 --> 28:51.188
-Do you have ghosts?
-Only nice ones.

28:52.197 --> 28:54.631
There are matches in the top drawer.

29:01.873 --> 29:03.738
-Wow!
-What?

29:04.976 --> 29:06.807
So, there are condoms in Tree Hill.

29:09.314 --> 29:13.341
Those are so not a plant.
They've been there since....

29:15.086 --> 29:17.213
-What?
-I just pictured you and Lucas.

29:17.288 --> 29:21.554
No. I never slept with Lucas.
It was Nathan.

29:23.027 --> 29:25.825
-I just pictured that, too.
-Okay, stop picturing things...

29:25.897 --> 29:27.990
because it's not like that.

29:28.666 --> 29:30.065
I'm not like that.

29:32.771 --> 29:34.864
I've only been with one guy...

29:34.939 --> 29:38.204
and so I'm kind of freaking out a little bit
because you're here...

29:38.276 --> 29:40.301
and you're way more experienced
than I am.

29:40.378 --> 29:43.074
-Hence your daughter, Jenny.
-Yeah.

29:44.149 --> 29:47.778
And it's still a big deal to me.

29:48.887 --> 29:50.184
Come here.

29:51.656 --> 29:53.647
I'm so happy to be with you right now.

29:54.125 --> 29:56.753
I could barely think straight
most of the week.

29:56.828 --> 29:59.592
-Yeah, me, too.
-AII right then, listen to me.

30:00.632 --> 30:02.497
I haven't felt like this in forever.

30:04.235 --> 30:07.261
I know that I might lose cool points
by saying this, but...

30:10.475 --> 30:13.638
let's just go slow, okay?

30:16.681 --> 30:17.807
Okay.

30:20.385 --> 30:23.183
But it's just that you never really
had any cool points.

30:23.888 --> 30:25.150
But....

30:25.557 --> 30:28.856
But, baby, you do now.

30:48.580 --> 30:52.243
-Praying for a miracle?
-I've decided to tell Keith the truth.

30:54.652 --> 30:56.711
I won't walk down the aisle before I do.

31:06.531 --> 31:07.930
Maybe you won't have to.

31:11.002 --> 31:12.492
I don't know, Jules.

31:12.570 --> 31:16.006
Maybe I'm getting soft in my old age.
Maybe it's this church...

31:16.708 --> 31:18.869
or just seeing you two crazy kids in love.

31:20.378 --> 31:22.403
But I think I'll just let this one go.

31:24.616 --> 31:26.311
Keith doesn't ever have to know.

31:28.019 --> 31:30.180
-If I do what?
-Nothing.

31:31.923 --> 31:33.322
Call it my wedding gift.

31:34.926 --> 31:36.120
I don't believe you.

31:39.831 --> 31:42.265
I've kept my word so far, haven't I?

31:49.674 --> 31:52.768
You couldn't turn your cell phone off
in a church?

31:53.912 --> 31:55.174
It might be God.

32:08.993 --> 32:11.393
Okay, Anna. I have it cued up.

32:12.263 --> 32:13.457
I didn't watch it.

32:14.666 --> 32:17.999
You just need to press this button
to start it and stop, okay?

32:19.971 --> 32:21.700
Do you want to know what I said?

32:22.573 --> 32:25.269
-You don't have to.
-I said I was bisexual.

32:28.413 --> 32:31.439
It's just....
I thought it would feel liberating...

32:31.950 --> 32:33.144
but it didn't.

32:33.651 --> 32:36.176
Instead, I just ended up here.

32:36.621 --> 32:37.781
Back in the closet.

32:38.489 --> 32:39.820
Then why'd you tell me?

32:40.491 --> 32:41.480
I don't know.

32:42.627 --> 32:47.087
I guess it's easier to tell one person
than it is to tell your whole world.

33:03.214 --> 33:05.273
You're okay. Just go with the bed spins.

33:07.485 --> 33:10.318
It's me. Pick the one in the middle.

33:11.222 --> 33:12.450
What happened?

33:13.624 --> 33:15.888
You got a little sideways.
I brought you home.

33:18.429 --> 33:20.727
-Is this your room?
-Yeah.

33:22.600 --> 33:23.658
It's nice.

33:24.802 --> 33:26.861
It was, until my parents sold everything.

33:27.305 --> 33:29.967
Last week they sold one of the ''O's''
in my first name.

33:30.074 --> 33:32.008
So, now I'm officially ''Broke Davis.''

33:36.481 --> 33:37.470
Okay.

33:41.719 --> 33:44.119
-You hit it pretty hard tonight.
-Yeah.

33:44.989 --> 33:46.115
Didn't you?

33:47.925 --> 33:49.586
-Not tonight.
-How come?

33:50.995 --> 33:53.122
It just didn't make sense for once.

33:53.631 --> 33:55.292
So instead I carted you here...

33:55.366 --> 33:59.234
then came up with a pretty killer idea
for a Safe Rides program.

34:00.571 --> 34:03.802
Your cab will be here soon.
You are my first client.

34:05.376 --> 34:08.243
-You're gonna make a great president.
-Thanks.

34:11.282 --> 34:13.341
Waste can behind you.

34:19.123 --> 34:20.317
Here goes.

34:20.658 --> 34:22.784
You should have your mail forwarded here.

34:23.393 --> 34:26.851
-They give you the same cell as before?
-I don't know. They redecorated.

34:27.899 --> 34:29.297
Great, make jokes.

34:29.367 --> 34:31.391
Do you know how much it's going
to cost me...

34:31.469 --> 34:34.199
-to get you two out of this mess?
-Then don't, all right?

34:34.272 --> 34:36.739
Don't cut any deals with me
like you did for Lucas.

34:43.246 --> 34:44.976
Tell Mom, ''Keith says hi.''

34:50.521 --> 34:53.081
-You told him.
-Yeah, I did.

34:53.858 --> 34:56.918
You should have. You're brothers.

34:58.830 --> 34:59.819
Go on.

35:00.832 --> 35:02.527
He could use a friend tonight.

35:16.247 --> 35:17.544
Thank you.

35:19.784 --> 35:21.012
Dad.

35:46.744 --> 35:49.076
I lost my way a little bit this year...

35:49.180 --> 35:52.274
but lately it's been better, you know.

35:53.317 --> 35:54.409
It's pretty amazing...

35:54.485 --> 35:59.184
how temptation can be silenced
by a ray of hope.

35:59.957 --> 36:03.723
But when the face of that hope
is a boy's face...

36:04.028 --> 36:07.964
I guess, for me,
hope comes with trust issues, too.

36:20.711 --> 36:22.679
She still loves you, you know.

36:27.185 --> 36:28.345
Look.

36:29.253 --> 36:32.518
It sucks that she kissed Chris...

36:32.790 --> 36:34.314
but Haley married you.

36:34.425 --> 36:37.861
I kind of think that wins out
over some confused kiss.

36:42.833 --> 36:44.892
Maybe I was the confusing part for her.

36:46.337 --> 36:47.497
Nathan...

36:49.140 --> 36:51.973
Haley fell for you
when you were a different guy.

36:52.977 --> 36:54.842
A lesser guy.

36:55.513 --> 36:59.745
Maybe you should remember the real
Haley, even when she's lesser, too.

37:03.120 --> 37:04.712
Let's get out of here, man.

37:07.525 --> 37:09.755
Come on, little brother. Let's go.

37:19.870 --> 37:21.269
How much do you hate me?

37:22.673 --> 37:23.833
I don't hate you.

37:24.675 --> 37:26.165
But you hated the party.

37:28.112 --> 37:29.306
I liked my presents.

37:32.717 --> 37:35.686
I was sitting there
at a perfectly decent party...

37:35.753 --> 37:39.154
like I have a thousand times before.

37:41.025 --> 37:44.153
Maybe, for the first time, I just felt like...

37:44.228 --> 37:46.287
I was meant for something more,
you know?

37:47.098 --> 37:48.622
More than I planned for you?

37:52.370 --> 37:55.737
''Let us not seek to fix the blame
for the past...

37:55.806 --> 37:58.969
''let us accept our own responsibility
for the future.''

38:00.478 --> 38:01.945
JFK said that.

38:03.080 --> 38:04.411
Look at you go.

38:06.484 --> 38:08.042
I'm proud of you, girlfriend.

38:09.186 --> 38:12.713
Thanks. I'm proud of me, too.

38:23.501 --> 38:27.665
After my accident I asked you
what the secret was to getting back.

38:29.340 --> 38:30.967
You remember what you told me?

38:32.610 --> 38:34.339
You told me there is no secret.

38:37.748 --> 38:41.206
You just start shooting one day
and deal with the pain.

38:48.459 --> 38:51.155
Somewhere along the way it gets easier.

39:03.007 --> 39:06.499
-Is Lucas okay?
-I'd say far from.

39:08.245 --> 39:11.009
My investigator found
something interesting about Dan.

39:14.685 --> 39:17.518
I just want you to know
that I won't tell anyone.

39:17.988 --> 39:20.855
About you and, you know, girls.

39:21.726 --> 39:22.920
Thanks, Mouth.

39:23.794 --> 39:25.591
But could you maybe not hit on Brooke?

39:25.663 --> 39:28.393
Because I've got enough competition
for her already.

39:30.101 --> 39:31.227
Okay.

39:31.702 --> 39:33.192
My name is Anna Tagarro.

39:33.704 --> 39:36.264
And I'm a junior at Tree Hill High.

39:36.874 --> 39:39.707
And...I'm gay.

39:41.078 --> 39:42.067
And straight.

39:43.080 --> 39:44.843
And a Latina.

39:45.983 --> 39:47.883
And I hate labels.

39:48.786 --> 39:52.882
And I hope by the time you see this,
those things won't be an issue.

39:54.058 --> 39:57.789
For now, all you need to know is this:

39:59.196 --> 40:00.458
My name is Anna...

40:01.999 --> 40:05.628
and I'm just trying to find my way,
like most kids.

40:07.738 --> 40:09.729
I guess that part is timeless.

40:27.391 --> 40:29.723
So, I'm seeing this girl and...

40:30.928 --> 40:33.897
I think our experience levels
are a little different, you know?

40:33.964 --> 40:38.799
But, even so, I'm doing something
with her that I've never done before.

40:41.572 --> 40:43.164
I'm falling in love.

40:43.774 --> 40:44.968
Bring it!

40:45.443 --> 40:46.705
Here you go.

40:50.214 --> 40:52.774
<i>My brother's been going through</i>
<i>a tough time lately.</i>

40:52.850 --> 40:54.818
<i>I wish there was more I could do</i>
<i>to help him.</i>

40:55.286 --> 40:58.380
I mean, just getting along
is kind of new to us.

41:00.391 --> 41:02.086
But I guess that's how brothers are.

41:07.398 --> 41:11.300
<i>Better to each other and worse</i>
<i>to each other than anybody else.</i>

41:15.806 --> 41:18.900
I also wish I could make things easier
for my mom.

41:21.245 --> 41:23.736
I mean, even though
it's been a tough year for us...

41:24.982 --> 41:27.109
I want her to be happy
more than anything.

41:30.020 --> 41:33.478
But that doesn't change the fact
that I need to get closer to my father.

41:35.793 --> 41:38.125
Because if I can get closer to him...

41:39.330 --> 41:41.321
maybe I can find a way to beat him...

41:42.466 --> 41:44.195
once and for all.

41:46.136 --> 41:49.037
And set the people that I love, free.

41:52.510 --> 41:55.604
I just hope I have the strength
to tear him down for good.

41:59.650 --> 42:04.280
<i>I suppose a fellow just wants to fit in,</i>
<i>find a good girl...</i>

42:05.055 --> 42:06.852
<i>maybe one day do great things.</i>

42:07.625 --> 42:10.059
<i>Tell us about that steady girl</i>
<i>of yours, Brian.</i>

42:11.595 --> 42:12.823
<i>Her name is Camilla.</i>

42:13.931 --> 42:17.230
<i>And my wish is that one day</i>
<i>she'll agree to be my wife.</i>

42:17.835 --> 42:19.325
<i>And we'll grow old together.</i>

42:20.604 --> 42:22.731
<i>I'd like to have a boy of my own one day.</i>

42:23.474 --> 42:24.941
<i>Heck, maybe lots of kids.</i>

42:25.776 --> 42:29.405
<i>I'd like to try to teach them</i>
<i>right from wrong...</i>

42:29.747 --> 42:31.180
<i>and good from bad.</i>

42:32.483 --> 42:34.917
<i>I'd like to let them teach me.</i>

42:36.320 --> 42:38.982
<i>I think I'd have something to offer them.</i>

42:39.456 --> 42:41.185
<i>Or I hope so.</i>

42:42.259 --> 42:43.920
<i>I guess only time will tell.</i>

43:29.907 --> 43:30.896
