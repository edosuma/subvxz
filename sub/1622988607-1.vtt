WEBVTT

00:22.997 --> 00:26.164
(pensive piano music)

01:35.755 --> 01:37.870
(door knocking)

01:37.870 --> 01:39.150
- [Man] Captain?

01:39.150 --> 01:39.983
- Sir.

01:43.120 --> 01:45.180
- Well, that's not exactly a view

01:45.180 --> 01:47.097
of the Afghani desert, ain't it?

01:47.097 --> 01:49.880
But I understand there's a Chick-Fil-A

01:49.880 --> 01:52.083
right within arm's reach so there's that.

01:53.100 --> 01:54.680
- It's a beautiful office, sir.

01:54.680 --> 01:55.703
Thank you very much.

01:56.920 --> 02:00.960
- Captain, I'd like to suggest
you decorate the place.

02:00.960 --> 02:03.073
Make it a little more homey, okay?

02:04.040 --> 02:05.920
A lot of the soldiers
returned from deployment

02:05.920 --> 02:09.190
where they've seen a lot of shit.

02:09.190 --> 02:10.203
Excuse my French.

02:11.900 --> 02:13.793
- Yes, sir, I completely understand.

02:14.640 --> 02:16.370
And I promise to do
everything in my powers

02:16.370 --> 02:17.670
to help these brave heroes

02:18.560 --> 02:21.063
and get them back on track
to healthy civilian lives.

02:23.420 --> 02:24.620
- Good.

02:24.620 --> 02:26.630
So if there's anything
you need, anything at all,

02:26.630 --> 02:28.230
I'm just a couple hallways away.

02:29.540 --> 02:30.533
- [Captain] Yes, sir.

02:38.790 --> 02:39.650
- Hey Jake.

02:39.650 --> 02:41.300
- Brian.
- Good to see you, man.

02:44.696 --> 02:46.410
Megan, how you doin'?

02:46.410 --> 02:47.505
- [Megan] Hey, good.

02:47.505 --> 02:49.040
- Do I have any more
appointments for the evening?

02:49.040 --> 02:51.050
- Yes, I was actually
getting ready to call you up

02:51.050 --> 02:52.510
because you do have one more.

02:52.510 --> 02:54.260
I just have to confirm his details.

02:56.560 --> 02:57.790
- You know what, I'll take it from here.

02:57.790 --> 02:58.730
- Oh no, it's no problem.

02:58.730 --> 03:00.640
I mean I just have to-
- No, I insist.

03:00.640 --> 03:01.473
Thank you.

03:03.024 --> 03:04.610
- Okay.

03:04.610 --> 03:05.443
You sure?

03:05.443 --> 03:06.723
- Yeah, enjoy your weekend.

03:07.630 --> 03:08.873
- [Megan] If you insist.

03:19.290 --> 03:20.244
Have a good day, sir.

03:20.244 --> 03:21.411
- You as well.

03:23.060 --> 03:24.087
- [Brian] Thank you for your patience.

03:24.087 --> 03:27.050
- Please, I just wanted to drop by,

03:27.050 --> 03:28.280
see how things are going.

03:28.280 --> 03:29.930
I just wanted to make sure

03:29.930 --> 03:33.173
everything's going smoothly on the inside.

03:34.270 --> 03:35.120
- Right this way.

03:50.344 --> 03:53.011
(pensive music)

04:00.050 --> 04:03.133
(vehicle clattering)

04:32.668 --> 04:35.888
(birds chirping)

04:35.888 --> 04:38.388
(light music)

04:41.357 --> 04:43.273
- Mmm, that is so happy.

04:44.980 --> 04:47.346
- [Woman] So, did she finish the dress?

04:47.346 --> 04:48.179
- Mhmm.

04:50.188 --> 04:52.688
It's so beautiful, so perfect.

04:54.100 --> 04:57.075
It's more beautiful than I
ever could have imagined it.

04:57.075 --> 04:59.793
Ah, I'm so excited!

05:01.264 --> 05:04.505
- Hey, I'm sorry that I can't be there.

05:04.505 --> 05:07.630
- Mhmm, I'm sorry too, Missy.

05:09.380 --> 05:10.583
So not okay.

05:16.430 --> 05:17.740
Seriously, how's your mom doing?

05:17.740 --> 05:20.832
- The doctor's are changing
up the medication again.

05:21.975 --> 05:25.150
We just have to wait and see.

05:25.150 --> 05:27.552
I am so happy for you though.

05:27.552 --> 05:29.954
You don't even know how good you got it.

05:29.954 --> 05:33.287
A great man, a happy family, a fun life.

05:37.770 --> 05:38.603
- My life?

05:39.999 --> 05:42.082
Yeah, yeah, you're right.

05:43.060 --> 05:44.525
I mean I wouldn't call it perfect,

05:44.525 --> 05:46.107
but after so long,
everything's finally going

05:46.107 --> 05:48.860
in the right direction, you know?

05:48.860 --> 05:52.000
Brian and I just put in
an offer on the house.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.733
So we can finally say goodbye
to the landlords here.

05:57.298 --> 06:00.167
- Right, if anyone deserves it, it's you.

06:01.080 --> 06:04.023
Everything you've been
through, losing the baby.

06:08.012 --> 06:10.429
Ugh, Tara, I'm such an idiot.

06:11.630 --> 06:14.380
I'm so sorry, Tara, I
shouldn't have brought it up.

06:14.380 --> 06:17.068
I should have just been happy for you.

06:17.068 --> 06:19.651
(somber music)

06:22.830 --> 06:24.163
- No, it's okay.

06:32.519 --> 06:35.413
Hey, Jules, it's okay.

06:37.540 --> 06:39.593
You're still my best friend.

06:43.200 --> 06:46.183
Hey, I still love you okay?

06:46.183 --> 06:49.409
(door knocking)

06:49.409 --> 06:50.540
Hey Jules, I need to let you go.

06:50.540 --> 06:51.940
I think those are the cards.

06:54.102 --> 06:55.630
(chuckling) Yeah, I need to let you go.

06:55.630 --> 06:57.247
Bye, I love you, talk to you later.

06:57.247 --> 06:58.493
Mwah mwah mwah, bye.

07:04.440 --> 07:05.310
Hi.

07:05.310 --> 07:06.320
Are these the cards?

07:06.320 --> 07:07.210
- You need to sign.

07:07.210 --> 07:08.780
- Okay.

07:08.780 --> 07:09.673
Okay, yeah.

07:11.360 --> 07:13.253
Yeah, right there.

07:15.140 --> 07:15.973
Great.

07:17.662 --> 07:19.136
- [Delivery Guy] There you go.

07:19.136 --> 07:21.670
- Okay, thank you so much.

07:21.670 --> 07:23.973
(ominous music)

07:23.973 --> 07:26.556
(Tara gasping)

07:44.723 --> 07:47.306
(Tara panting)

08:03.119 --> 08:05.869
(pulse thumping)

08:09.833 --> 08:14.833
What the fuck?

08:16.030 --> 08:17.197
What the fuck?

08:22.806 --> 08:26.306
(grunting) What the fuck?

08:33.953 --> 08:34.982
Hello?

08:34.982 --> 08:36.374
Hello?

08:36.374 --> 08:37.842
(knocking)

08:37.842 --> 08:40.010
Is there anyone out there?

08:45.004 --> 08:48.687
Oh my god! (whimpering)

08:48.687 --> 08:50.790
Someone help me!

08:50.790 --> 08:55.790
What the fuck is this? (whimpering)

08:56.346 --> 08:57.179
Help!

08:58.158 --> 08:58.991
Help!

09:03.352 --> 09:05.269
What's happening to me?

09:10.902 --> 09:12.073
Why is this happening to me?

09:12.073 --> 09:13.388
- I give people pills and tell them

09:13.388 --> 09:15.209
to call me in the morning.

09:15.209 --> 09:17.626
I don't actually help people.

09:23.710 --> 09:25.136
- Yeah.

09:25.136 --> 09:27.283
Yeah it's the best feeling
in the world, actually.

09:29.300 --> 09:31.100
Helping people overcome their fears,

09:32.600 --> 09:34.200
dealing with their inner demons.

09:36.940 --> 09:38.390
- You're kinda like a priest,

09:41.080 --> 09:42.413
exorcising demons.

09:47.670 --> 09:50.583
- Brian, the demons aren't real though.

09:51.970 --> 09:53.220
It's just in their minds.

09:56.140 --> 09:58.433
I help them correct their thought process,

09:59.550 --> 10:00.860
force them to face reality,

10:00.860 --> 10:02.923
or my interpretation of it.

10:05.769 --> 10:06.819
It brings them peace.

10:09.200 --> 10:10.873
- Well the point is you help people.

10:13.768 --> 10:14.868
- You really think so?

10:18.426 --> 10:22.093
Hello?

10:22.093 --> 10:24.760
(door slamming)

10:29.420 --> 10:30.430
Who are you?

10:30.430 --> 10:31.280
What do you want?

10:33.300 --> 10:34.303
Please let me go,

10:34.303 --> 10:35.136
just let me go please.

10:35.136 --> 10:35.969
- Shh.

10:40.410 --> 10:41.243
In good time.

10:43.415 --> 10:44.333
All in good time.

10:48.141 --> 10:51.391
(plastic bag rustling)

11:14.070 --> 11:14.980
- Can I use the bathroom?

11:14.980 --> 11:18.303
- Your chain will reach to the bathroom.

11:21.840 --> 11:22.993
You're not an animal.

11:24.390 --> 11:25.223
Yet.

11:29.500 --> 11:30.333
- I don't know who you are

11:30.333 --> 11:31.820
but you have the wrong person.

11:33.353 --> 11:35.436
Please let me go, please.

11:36.569 --> 11:38.107
Please.

11:38.107 --> 11:39.899
I won't tell anyone, I won't.

11:39.899 --> 11:42.899
- I'll pull your fucking tongue out.

11:53.582 --> 11:54.415
- Please let me go, please.

11:55.730 --> 11:56.823
Please let me go.

11:57.660 --> 11:58.493
- In time.

11:59.670 --> 12:01.260
In time.

12:01.260 --> 12:02.163
All in good time.

12:04.340 --> 12:06.680
- No, no, no.

12:06.680 --> 12:09.878
No, no, no, please, please, please!

12:09.878 --> 12:11.128
Please, no, no!

12:12.725 --> 12:13.558
Please!

12:14.712 --> 12:15.545
No!

12:16.384 --> 12:18.217
I just want to be out!

12:19.499 --> 12:21.416
Everything was perfect.

14:05.733 --> 14:08.400
(door creaking)

14:20.850 --> 14:21.683
- Tara?

14:34.644 --> 14:36.394
What did she buy now?

14:52.940 --> 14:53.773
Oh.

14:55.644 --> 14:56.477
Wow.

14:59.946 --> 15:00.779
How sweet.

15:03.787 --> 15:04.620
Hm.

15:17.641 --> 15:20.141
(tense music)

16:42.100 --> 16:44.357
- Come on, you can do this.

16:44.357 --> 16:45.536
You can do this.

16:45.536 --> 16:48.270
- [Brian] Are you sure about this?

16:48.270 --> 16:49.883
- Yes, I'm sure.

16:51.900 --> 16:53.193
I have plenty of options.

16:54.310 --> 16:56.520
With my credentials, there's
gonna be a local clinic

16:56.520 --> 16:58.653
or a hospital that can use my experience.

17:01.090 --> 17:02.880
Besides, most of these doctors

17:02.880 --> 17:05.369
that are fresh out of medical school,

17:05.369 --> 17:08.050
they can't really help
people that need help.

17:08.050 --> 17:09.980
- Yeah, you're right about that.

17:11.359 --> 17:12.613
But I don't know, I just,

17:13.522 --> 17:15.270
I don't wanna be that guy

17:15.270 --> 17:18.343
whose wife leaves everything for.

17:19.443 --> 17:23.569
And I don't know, maybe 10, 20 years later

17:23.569 --> 17:25.653
she resents him and kills him in the bed.

17:29.297 --> 17:30.260
(laughing)

17:30.260 --> 17:31.930
- Wait, wait, whoah.

17:31.930 --> 17:33.360
Baby, hold up, hang on.

17:33.360 --> 17:36.960
You think I'm going to
murder you in our bed

17:36.960 --> 17:37.810
in 20 years time?

17:41.171 --> 17:43.123
That's so cute, baby.

17:45.420 --> 17:46.620
What do you think of me?

17:48.964 --> 17:51.323
You know I can think of
a thousand ways to kill.

17:52.621 --> 17:53.770
But bed, ugh.

17:56.630 --> 17:57.680
It isn't one of them.

18:00.543 --> 18:03.043
(tense music)

18:10.800 --> 18:13.000
There's plenty of other
methods of homicide.

18:15.525 --> 18:16.675
- How many do you know?

18:18.350 --> 18:19.650
- Well I could poison you.

18:21.226 --> 18:22.059
I could slip you a drug

18:22.059 --> 18:23.260
that would slowly and cleanly

18:23.260 --> 18:25.047
tear you apart from the inside,

18:28.270 --> 18:29.420
leaving no mess at all.

18:38.927 --> 18:41.533
I'm joking, baby. (laughing)

18:45.400 --> 18:46.683
Oh, come on.

18:49.960 --> 18:52.260
You just have to know I
was an army psychologist

18:52.260 --> 18:53.580
for so many years,

18:53.580 --> 18:56.893
and yeah I've heard a lot of stories.

18:58.246 --> 18:59.746
- I know you have.

19:02.348 --> 19:04.390
- Well I wanna get out of it.

19:04.390 --> 19:05.923
Open up my own practice.

19:06.930 --> 19:08.680
I actually wanna help abused women.

19:10.658 --> 19:12.320
When I'm more stable,

19:12.320 --> 19:14.843
when we are more stable.

19:16.650 --> 19:18.460
- Yeah, I get that, but,

19:21.140 --> 19:22.210
I mean if you leave how do you know

19:22.210 --> 19:23.640
if you're gonna be stable,

19:23.640 --> 19:26.483
if we are gonna be stable?

19:26.483 --> 19:28.233
You know, you never know.

19:30.690 --> 19:32.190
I mean are you're really sure?

19:34.720 --> 19:35.553
- Yeah.

19:36.610 --> 19:37.443
Yes, I'm sure.

19:38.522 --> 19:39.355
- Okay.

19:41.619 --> 19:42.452
Okay.

19:44.320 --> 19:46.373
- Yes, I am so sure.

19:47.984 --> 19:51.513
(Brian chuckling)

19:51.513 --> 19:52.513
I am so sure.

19:56.020 --> 19:57.720
What did you learn at Camp McCall?

20:01.660 --> 20:03.240
SEER.

20:03.240 --> 20:05.673
Survival, Evasion, Resistance.

20:08.570 --> 20:09.403
Escape.

20:11.070 --> 20:13.260
The first moments are the most critical.

20:13.260 --> 20:14.860
Try to escape before you become,

20:17.300 --> 20:18.133
captured.

20:19.480 --> 20:22.040
Once you become captured, your
chances of escape go down.

20:22.040 --> 20:24.560
Your situation becomes
much more difficult.

20:24.560 --> 20:27.170
You lose tenacity and fear takes over.

20:27.170 --> 20:28.873
A weapon, you need a weapon.

20:33.520 --> 20:34.820
Your mind, Tara.

20:34.820 --> 20:35.920
Your mind is a weapon.

20:37.550 --> 20:39.410
All those sessions with soldiers with PTSD

20:39.410 --> 20:41.070
went way over the edge.

20:41.070 --> 20:44.323
No other psychologist would
take them, but you did.

20:44.323 --> 20:46.740
And did any of them ever harm you, no.

20:46.740 --> 20:48.050
Because you used your head.

20:48.050 --> 20:49.513
You controlled the situation.

20:53.340 --> 20:55.590
The man who delivered the box.

20:55.590 --> 20:57.590
You've seen him somewhere before, where?

20:58.570 --> 21:00.000
Was he in the army?

21:00.000 --> 21:01.550
Was he one of Brian's patients?

21:02.470 --> 21:04.920
Did you run into him at the surplus store?

21:04.920 --> 21:06.033
Think, Tara.

21:07.170 --> 21:09.090
The man who delivered the box,

21:09.090 --> 21:10.140
he's your first clue.

21:17.070 --> 21:18.794
Don't give up.

21:18.794 --> 21:20.297
Focus on something you can do.

21:24.822 --> 21:26.572
Radio, get the radio.

21:31.170 --> 21:32.003
Ah, fuck.

21:32.932 --> 21:36.099
(lightly tense music)

21:45.305 --> 21:46.810
It's doubtful it would
be someone from the army,

21:46.810 --> 21:48.260
you'd been out almost two years.

21:48.260 --> 21:49.690
Next question, why.

21:49.690 --> 21:51.820
Why would someone take you?

21:51.820 --> 21:53.523
Use your training, Tara, think.

21:55.007 --> 21:56.403
Why do people get kidnapped?

21:57.299 --> 22:00.451
Think, think!

22:00.451 --> 22:01.701
People get kidnapped for,

22:02.610 --> 22:04.140
money?

22:04.140 --> 22:04.973
Revenge?

22:07.330 --> 22:09.330
Mental disorder like Norman from Psycho.

22:11.490 --> 22:13.220
Physical torture and...

22:17.100 --> 22:17.933
sex.

22:19.700 --> 22:21.620
Women get kidnapped for sex,

22:21.620 --> 22:24.273
for sex trafficking and
to become sex slaves.

22:26.304 --> 22:28.940
Money, why wouldn't they take someone

22:28.940 --> 22:31.180
with a more substantial income?

22:31.180 --> 22:32.440
All of our money is going to student loans

22:32.440 --> 22:33.930
and now the house,

22:33.930 --> 22:34.960
and currency's going digital,

22:34.960 --> 22:36.773
there's no way he'd get away with it.

22:43.260 --> 22:44.770
You led a decent life.

22:44.770 --> 22:46.990
You never intentionally
tried to harm anyone.

22:46.990 --> 22:48.020
And you drive like an old lady

22:48.020 --> 22:49.993
so road rage is out, revenge is out.

22:51.280 --> 22:52.710
Wait now.

22:52.710 --> 22:54.159
What about Brian's ex-girlfriend?

22:54.159 --> 22:55.477
Oh no.

22:55.477 --> 22:57.277
She's planning my bridal shower now.

23:02.130 --> 23:03.630
This was too well planned out.

23:04.930 --> 23:05.763
Mental disorder.

23:07.060 --> 23:09.443
Even the craziest soldiers,
you treated them well.

23:12.830 --> 23:14.910
And whoever did it has some
kind of medical background

23:14.910 --> 23:17.210
because he knocked me out with something.

23:17.210 --> 23:18.163
Physical torture.

23:25.092 --> 23:26.010
No.

23:26.010 --> 23:27.842
No, he left me food and water.

23:27.842 --> 23:28.700
If he wanted to torture me

23:28.700 --> 23:30.690
he'd make me beg for food and water.

23:30.690 --> 23:32.180
Sex traffickers generally take women

23:32.180 --> 23:33.180
who won't be missed.

23:34.200 --> 23:36.513
And Brian will notice, Julie will notice.

23:37.600 --> 23:40.050
But it has to be either torture or sex

23:40.050 --> 23:42.210
and neither of those is an option.

23:42.210 --> 23:43.043
Torture.

23:47.620 --> 23:48.920
He'd beat me first.

23:48.920 --> 23:50.080
He'd show me that he is the master

23:50.080 --> 23:51.030
and I am the slave.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.692
But both torture and sex,

23:53.692 --> 23:55.120
they drug the victim first.

23:55.120 --> 23:56.320
No.

23:56.320 --> 23:57.560
You had to twist open the bottle

23:57.560 --> 23:59.010
and the packages were sealed.

24:02.740 --> 24:03.603
Okay, okay.

24:07.950 --> 24:09.143
Sex, it has to be sex.

24:10.970 --> 24:13.376
But why haven't they gang raped me yet?

24:13.376 --> 24:14.670
It's the first step.

24:14.670 --> 24:15.503
Second step.

24:15.503 --> 24:17.550
First step is they drug the victim first.

24:20.450 --> 24:22.480
But trafficking organizations
have a top age of 25

24:22.480 --> 24:25.260
and I'm...

24:25.260 --> 24:26.530
Evasion.

24:26.530 --> 24:29.770
Your captors will deliberately
try to disorient you.

24:29.770 --> 24:32.340
Think, Tara, think.

24:32.340 --> 24:34.903
What do you recall before waking up here?

24:36.988 --> 24:37.821
Think!

24:39.532 --> 24:41.412
I don't know.

24:41.412 --> 24:42.495
I don't know.

24:43.873 --> 24:44.706
Not real.

24:56.885 --> 24:59.385
I don't recall waking up here.

25:00.478 --> 25:03.159
(screaming)

25:03.159 --> 25:04.486
Help!

25:04.486 --> 25:06.100
What are you doing, be quiet.

25:06.100 --> 25:07.783
Do you want to get yourself killed?

25:09.590 --> 25:10.423
Listen.

25:15.816 --> 25:18.566
(birds chirping)

25:25.256 --> 25:27.089
I don't hear anything.

25:34.246 --> 25:35.079
Birds.

25:36.360 --> 25:37.193
Birds!

25:40.486 --> 25:42.319
I'm outside somewhere.

25:44.667 --> 25:45.867
Outside somewhere where,

25:47.141 --> 25:48.724
where no one can...

25:52.221 --> 25:54.388
(sobbing)

25:58.008 --> 26:00.211
Why is this happening?

26:00.211 --> 26:03.628
I don't know why this is happening to me.

26:04.678 --> 26:06.750
I don't deserve this.

26:06.750 --> 26:10.290
Article V of the US Military
Code of Conduct states

26:10.290 --> 26:12.950
if your questioned should
you become a prisoner of war,

26:12.950 --> 26:14.960
you're required to give your name, rank,

26:14.960 --> 26:16.660
service number, and date of birth.

26:17.950 --> 26:19.670
You will evade answering
any further questions

26:19.670 --> 26:21.170
to the utmost of your ability.

26:23.060 --> 26:25.410
If your captors want
information, play dumb.

26:25.410 --> 26:27.730
You're just a lowly private
who doesn't know anything.

26:27.730 --> 26:29.460
If you're higher ranking,
tell them that your aides

26:29.460 --> 26:30.750
work out all the battle plans for you

26:30.750 --> 26:33.210
and you don't know them yourself.

26:33.210 --> 26:35.960
Hell, tell them you just make
the coffee in the office.

26:40.279 --> 26:41.860
(sobbing)

26:41.860 --> 26:44.750
But above everything else, keep the faith.

26:44.750 --> 26:46.920
You will escape of you will get rescued.

26:46.920 --> 26:47.958
I don't understand.

26:47.958 --> 26:49.220
But you will survive

26:49.220 --> 26:52.683
and you will return home with honor.

26:54.602 --> 26:57.269
(door clanking)

27:02.531 --> 27:05.198
(door slamming)

27:06.506 --> 27:07.923
What do you want?

27:11.089 --> 27:13.547
Please tell me what you want.

27:13.547 --> 27:14.380
Please.

27:28.900 --> 27:32.713
- Do you know what "de opresso
liber" means, Cassandra?

27:34.750 --> 27:36.050
- My name isn't Cassandra.

27:37.170 --> 27:38.110
You've got the wrong person,

27:38.110 --> 27:39.310
you're making a mistake.

27:41.200 --> 27:42.500
- What's in a name anyway?

27:44.580 --> 27:47.463
Today, right now.

27:50.840 --> 27:52.003
At this very moment,

27:53.740 --> 27:55.003
your name is Cassandra.

27:59.400 --> 28:00.503
My name is Bruce.

28:04.750 --> 28:05.583
Now.

28:07.700 --> 28:08.533
Say your name.

28:16.600 --> 28:19.390
Say your name.

28:19.390 --> 28:20.223
- Cassandra.

28:22.970 --> 28:23.803
- Good.

28:27.100 --> 28:28.750
Have a pleasant night, Cassandra.

28:33.106 --> 28:35.170
(tense music)

28:35.170 --> 28:36.113
- Wait, Bruce.

28:37.450 --> 28:38.283
Bruce.

28:40.690 --> 28:41.540
What do you want?

28:43.759 --> 28:47.400
I don't have any money.

28:47.400 --> 28:48.950
Have I hurt you, do I know you?

28:52.011 --> 28:53.030
I don't know any Cassandras,

28:53.030 --> 28:54.313
you're making a mistake.

28:56.590 --> 28:59.340
Please, just let me go.

28:59.340 --> 29:01.373
Just let me go, Bruce, please.

29:02.896 --> 29:04.602
- You will tell no one?

29:04.602 --> 29:06.602
- [Tara] No one, no one, I swear to God.

29:08.008 --> 29:08.841
I swear.

29:12.240 --> 29:13.687
- Soon.

29:13.687 --> 29:15.143
But not yet, Cassandra.

29:16.320 --> 29:17.170
All in good time.

29:18.703 --> 29:19.553
All in good time.

29:22.827 --> 29:23.763
- Bruce, Bruce!

29:25.030 --> 29:26.100
Wait, no, no!

29:27.417 --> 29:30.084
(door slamming)

29:39.370 --> 29:40.477
Why am I here?

29:43.050 --> 29:44.450
- We're here to help people.

29:47.550 --> 29:48.930
- Sometimes I wonder whether I'm helping

29:48.930 --> 29:49.793
anyone at all.

29:51.230 --> 29:52.740
- Captain, you couldn't have known.

29:52.740 --> 29:53.573
- No, I should have known.

29:53.573 --> 29:56.730
He was my patient, I was
treating him, I was...

29:56.730 --> 29:58.883
- You said it before, Captain.

30:00.100 --> 30:01.483
We can't save everyone.

30:03.950 --> 30:04.823
- But Eddie, I,

30:05.915 --> 30:07.150
Eddie, I could have saved him!

30:07.150 --> 30:09.143
- These soldiers are mentally unsound.

30:10.250 --> 30:11.287
- No, it's my fault.

30:11.287 --> 30:12.511
There was something I missed.

30:12.511 --> 30:13.760
There was something...

30:13.760 --> 30:15.100
There was something I missed.

30:15.100 --> 30:17.973
- They undergo extensive training.

30:19.530 --> 30:21.650
They're deprived of rest and food

30:21.650 --> 30:22.713
for weeks on end.

30:24.210 --> 30:26.120
Now he probably knew exactly

30:26.120 --> 30:27.473
what you wanted to hear.

30:29.690 --> 30:31.583
And Captain, he wanted to go back.

30:33.000 --> 30:34.483
And that is not your fault.

30:36.320 --> 30:39.173
- Colonel, sir, it is my fault.

30:42.600 --> 30:43.543
It's my job.

30:48.290 --> 30:49.400
I should have seen through his act.

30:49.400 --> 30:51.860
I should have confirmed my suspicions

30:51.860 --> 30:54.980
on his diagnosis way before
any of this happened.

30:54.980 --> 30:57.640
I could have closed the gate on this.

30:57.640 --> 30:59.790
He killed a whole team
of Afghan nationals.

31:01.300 --> 31:02.750
And they never saw it coming.

31:08.840 --> 31:11.350
They weren't there for the A-team.

31:11.350 --> 31:12.773
You and I both know that.

31:17.114 --> 31:18.510
They took it way beyond self-defense.

31:18.510 --> 31:20.060
It was way beyond self-defense.

31:22.360 --> 31:24.310
It was walking around with
their bloody intestines

31:24.310 --> 31:25.791
all over his shoulders

31:25.791 --> 31:26.680
and he was going to each-

31:26.680 --> 31:27.513
- Captain!

31:29.140 --> 31:29.973
Don't.

31:32.060 --> 31:32.923
Please don't.

31:36.300 --> 31:40.630
- Bruce said "de opresso liber".

31:40.630 --> 31:41.953
To free the opressed.

31:43.758 --> 31:45.680
Bruce was a green beret.

31:45.680 --> 31:48.657
Or PSYOPs, he might be
doing this because of Eddie.

31:48.657 --> 31:49.490
But why?

31:51.037 --> 31:52.497
There's nothing to be gained.

31:55.217 --> 31:57.717
(tense music)

32:00.480 --> 32:01.750
I can't tell the army Eddie's okay,

32:01.750 --> 32:03.250
it's too late for that.

32:03.250 --> 32:04.870
- [Eddie] Why?

32:04.870 --> 32:06.220
- Because it will help you.

32:08.099 --> 32:09.449
- The mission's classified.

32:11.730 --> 32:13.770
- Yes, of course, Eddie, but

32:15.330 --> 32:18.450
I do have the necessary
clearance for this and

32:18.450 --> 32:20.650
everything we talk about
remains classified.

32:22.730 --> 32:24.700
Look, you don't have to tell me anything

32:24.700 --> 32:25.670
you don't wanna talk about.

32:25.670 --> 32:29.593
Just tell me about how you're feeling,

32:31.050 --> 32:32.100
what you're thinking,

32:33.190 --> 32:34.883
so we can sort through this together.

32:34.883 --> 32:35.716
- We.

32:37.090 --> 32:39.020
I like the way you just did that.

32:40.733 --> 32:42.400
- And what was that?

32:43.567 --> 32:47.236
- The way you took my problem

32:47.236 --> 32:48.773
and made it about us.

32:50.010 --> 32:50.853
You're good.

32:52.456 --> 32:55.813
But you're gonna somehow keep my demons

32:56.710 --> 32:58.023
locked in the closet?

33:01.220 --> 33:03.316
- You have to trust me, Eddie.

33:03.316 --> 33:04.980
I'm really here to help you.

33:04.980 --> 33:05.813
- Trust?

33:07.410 --> 33:08.560
That's a good one, Doc.

33:09.460 --> 33:14.170
You know, that's exactly what
we would say to the natives

33:15.230 --> 33:18.850
whenever we would stroll
up in their village

33:18.850 --> 33:21.830
wanting them to put
their lives in the line

33:21.830 --> 33:23.283
to fight our war.

33:24.420 --> 33:25.293
Trust us.

33:26.789 --> 33:28.093
Trust us.

33:29.120 --> 33:30.443
We are here to help.

33:32.070 --> 33:35.910
You know like I know that's
nothing but bullshit.

33:35.910 --> 33:37.293
We train them to fight.

33:38.430 --> 33:40.833
Then when the president says it's enough,

33:42.070 --> 33:44.023
we get to go home to America.

33:45.590 --> 33:50.000
While those natives have
to watch their daughters

33:50.850 --> 33:55.690
get raped and slaughtered
like fucking pigs.

33:57.530 --> 33:59.180
- Eddie, you were doing your job.

34:00.410 --> 34:02.000
You cannot believe that those people

34:02.000 --> 34:03.762
were your responsibility.

34:03.762 --> 34:06.663
- (laughing) Yeah, okay.

34:08.495 --> 34:10.280
- Look, if it was really that bad

34:11.429 --> 34:12.723
why do you wanna go back?

34:13.889 --> 34:16.513
- Now there's a good question, good girl.

34:21.790 --> 34:22.672
Because,

34:23.920 --> 34:25.803
it's the only thing I know how to do.

34:27.545 --> 34:29.770
And I'm very, very good at it.

34:32.746 --> 34:33.580
- Okay, Eddie.

34:35.120 --> 34:37.090
Why don't you tell me a little bit of

34:37.090 --> 34:39.139
how you came to be on the Special Forces?

34:42.510 --> 34:44.710
Tell me a little bit
about your family life.

34:45.670 --> 34:47.570
Did you have any brothers and sisters?

34:48.469 --> 34:50.320
What did your father do for a living?

34:51.770 --> 34:53.719
Tell me a little bit about your mother.

34:55.199 --> 34:56.480
Let me get to know you a little bit.

34:56.480 --> 34:58.043
- We're gonna do this?

35:02.530 --> 35:05.643
Four professions that I truly despise.

35:06.700 --> 35:08.283
You wanna hear 'em?

35:09.660 --> 35:11.150
- [Tara] Yeah.

35:11.150 --> 35:12.470
- Okay.

35:12.470 --> 35:15.480
One, attorneys.

35:15.480 --> 35:16.467
Fucking hate 'em.

35:17.820 --> 35:20.863
Two, doctors.

35:22.190 --> 35:25.933
Three, good old car salesmen.

35:28.460 --> 35:33.133
And four, my favorite of
the bunch, psychologists.

35:35.990 --> 35:40.833
Because y'all think that
you know more than me.

35:42.727 --> 35:47.727
And you believe in that
warped fucking mind

35:49.350 --> 35:50.733
that I need your help.

35:52.120 --> 35:52.953
I don't.

35:55.860 --> 35:57.373
- Eddie, I'm here to help you.

35:58.290 --> 35:59.463
- You read my file.

36:00.600 --> 36:03.280
You know that I was orphaned
at the age of seven.

36:03.280 --> 36:06.613
You know that I graduated
from high school with honors.

36:07.476 --> 36:11.333
You know that I got a
Bachelor's Degree in Education.

36:12.480 --> 36:15.900
And you also know that after three years

36:15.900 --> 36:17.750
I joined the army.

36:17.750 --> 36:19.660
And then after that, after two,

36:19.660 --> 36:21.453
I was selected for green berets.

36:22.380 --> 36:23.830
You know everything about me.

36:24.840 --> 36:27.088
But you wanna sit there,

36:27.088 --> 36:29.020
look me in my eyes

36:29.900 --> 36:33.240
and play these little
fucking mind games with me

36:33.240 --> 36:35.360
about how I'm feeling.

36:35.360 --> 36:39.450
And whether the fact that
my father was a minister

36:39.450 --> 36:41.913
is causing me to doubt what I'm doing.

36:44.970 --> 36:45.803
- [Tara] Your fath-

36:45.803 --> 36:47.970
(hands slamming)
- My father,

36:47.970 --> 36:49.063
was a mechanic.

36:50.270 --> 36:51.607
But you already knew that.

36:57.910 --> 36:58.743
Doc.

37:01.640 --> 37:03.110
I'm tired of killing.

37:04.707 --> 37:06.120
But it's all I know.

37:08.685 --> 37:10.018
It's all I know.

37:11.000 --> 37:12.550
- Eddie, I have read your file.

37:15.330 --> 37:17.070
And I also know that you and your team

37:17.070 --> 37:19.333
rescued many, many hostages.

37:22.080 --> 37:23.653
You might have taken lives,

37:25.320 --> 37:27.133
but you saved many, many more.

37:30.060 --> 37:31.410
Lives that would have been lost

37:31.410 --> 37:32.893
had you not been there.

37:36.900 --> 37:38.310
You've done a lot of good.

37:41.880 --> 37:43.880
- We have a motto in the Special Forces.

37:46.407 --> 37:47.997
"De opresso libre".

37:49.510 --> 37:50.963
To free the opressed.

37:52.860 --> 37:54.157
You think about that.

37:54.157 --> 37:56.303
- It has to be related to Eddie, but why?

38:03.860 --> 38:05.770
The families of the soldiers?

38:05.770 --> 38:07.540
Do they want revenge?

38:07.540 --> 38:08.410
Eddie was also a part

38:08.410 --> 38:10.333
of the Apsychological Operations Unit.

38:11.560 --> 38:13.770
They were responsible for
using nonviolent means

38:13.770 --> 38:15.570
to persuade enemy and neutral nations

38:15.570 --> 38:18.140
to take actions that the
US Government wanted.

38:18.140 --> 38:19.640
This is because of Eddie then.

38:23.930 --> 38:25.130
Do they want me to talk?

38:27.644 --> 38:28.477
Is this a trick?

38:33.883 --> 38:34.716
If this isn't about Eddie and I,

38:34.716 --> 38:35.923
don't use the radio then.

38:41.270 --> 38:42.970
They'll torture, rape and kill me.

38:45.456 --> 38:46.870
Is it worth the risk?

38:46.870 --> 38:47.703
No, not yet.

38:49.200 --> 38:50.810
Brian will call the police.

38:50.810 --> 38:53.210
They'll interview the neighbors.

38:53.210 --> 38:55.610
Mrs. Olson, the busybody,
she's always watching.

38:56.520 --> 38:58.932
She will tell them that you got kidnapped.

38:58.932 --> 39:01.240
She'll give them the license plate number.

39:01.240 --> 39:03.550
The police will track the
vehicle to this location.

39:03.550 --> 39:04.500
They will find you.

39:05.510 --> 39:06.810
Just keep the faith, Tara.

39:08.120 --> 39:08.973
Keep the faith.

39:10.800 --> 39:12.400
Yeah.

39:12.400 --> 39:14.050
Yeah, yeah Brian's gonna find me.

39:16.050 --> 39:18.100
I know it, I know it, he's gonna find me.

39:19.996 --> 39:22.496
(tense music)

39:32.735 --> 39:35.818
(eerie techno music)

39:43.820 --> 39:44.653
- [Brian] She's not at the house.

39:44.653 --> 39:46.500
Do you know where she is?

39:46.500 --> 39:48.300
- [Julie] You didn't get her text?

39:48.300 --> 39:49.340
- No, no.

39:49.340 --> 39:51.740
Well, no.

39:51.740 --> 39:53.040
- [Julie] She said that
she decided to talk

39:53.040 --> 39:55.690
to her former Colonel to
see about getting referrals.

39:57.390 --> 40:00.350
- [Brian] Colonel Reeder
in North Carolina?

40:00.350 --> 40:01.707
- [Julie] Yes, at Fort Bragg?

40:01.707 --> 40:03.890
- But we were supposed to
see the venues this week.

40:03.890 --> 40:06.477
- [Julie] She said that she'd
be gone at least three days.

40:06.477 --> 40:08.790
- But why would she go
to Fort Bragg, I mean?

40:08.790 --> 40:09.920
- [Julie] Clients.

40:09.920 --> 40:11.240
The Colonel said he'd work up a list

40:11.240 --> 40:12.820
of current and former military wives

40:12.820 --> 40:15.063
who might be interested
in counseling sessions.

40:16.190 --> 40:17.650
- Okay, um...

40:17.650 --> 40:18.580
- [Julie] I shouldn't tell you

40:18.580 --> 40:20.100
but she was hoping this would be something

40:20.100 --> 40:21.150
of a wedding present.

40:22.090 --> 40:23.570
She knows you spent a lot,

40:23.570 --> 40:25.540
and she loves you more than anything,

40:25.540 --> 40:26.853
you have to know that.

40:29.270 --> 40:32.093
By the way, put the cards
in the refrigerator.

40:34.890 --> 40:37.290
- All right, yeah, cool.

40:37.290 --> 40:39.333
All right Julie, I'll talk to you later.

40:40.480 --> 40:41.563
Thanks, bye.

40:48.900 --> 40:50.750
Put the cards in the refrigerator?

40:50.750 --> 40:52.150
- It shouldn't be this cold.

40:55.310 --> 40:57.510
Don't be stupid, he's
using sensory torture.

40:58.908 --> 41:00.290
And what makes you think he didn't plant

41:00.290 --> 41:02.180
the radio there for you to use?

41:02.180 --> 41:04.280
To get you to talk, to spill your secrets!

41:09.110 --> 41:11.740
The radio was over there, it was hiding.

41:11.740 --> 41:13.790
He probably didn't even know it was here.

41:15.150 --> 41:16.630
He chained you to the RV floor,

41:16.630 --> 41:18.430
of course he would have searched it.

41:19.690 --> 41:22.140
Well if he thought this
was a temporary place,

41:22.140 --> 41:22.973
maybe he didn't know.

41:22.973 --> 41:24.553
Maybe he didn't know it was here.

41:29.590 --> 41:33.000
But if I don't use the
radio and he comes back...

41:37.550 --> 41:39.050
Don't think about what could happen.

41:39.050 --> 41:40.103
Think about escape.

41:47.812 --> 41:49.320
It's worth the risk.

41:49.320 --> 41:50.420
It's your only chance.

42:33.115 --> 42:35.365
(scraping)

42:37.860 --> 42:38.693
Hello?

42:42.660 --> 42:44.110
Hello, is there anyone there?

42:47.770 --> 42:49.993
Hello, hello, is there anyone there?

42:51.210 --> 42:52.400
Someone please an...

42:54.770 --> 42:56.020
Someone please answer me.

42:58.450 --> 42:59.860
Hello?

42:59.860 --> 43:01.439
Hello, please, someone.

43:01.439 --> 43:02.939
This is so stupid.

43:05.174 --> 43:07.091
- [Man] Yeah, I'm here.

43:09.920 --> 43:11.370
- Hi, hi.

43:11.370 --> 43:12.203
I need help.

43:13.524 --> 43:15.133
- [Man] Yeah, well don't we all?

43:16.784 --> 43:18.130
- No, I'm serious.

43:18.130 --> 43:19.130
I've been kidnapped.

43:20.560 --> 43:22.753
- [Man] Yeah sure, tell me another one.

43:24.320 --> 43:25.550
- I'm being serious.

43:25.550 --> 43:27.070
Somebody took me out of my apartment

43:27.070 --> 43:29.044
and put me in an RV.

43:29.044 --> 43:31.340
- [Man] Oh, I get it.

43:31.340 --> 43:33.180
You and your girlfriends are
taking a little road trip

43:33.180 --> 43:34.133
in an RV, huh?

43:35.260 --> 43:38.410
Well, radio's not a thing
to play around with.

43:38.410 --> 43:40.560
Like, you teasing the guys, huh,

43:40.560 --> 43:41.580
so get the hell off the air

43:41.580 --> 43:43.190
and go tell your girlfriends that-

43:43.190 --> 43:46.040
- I'm being fucking
serious, I got kidnapped!

43:46.040 --> 43:47.390
- [Man] Then call the cops!

43:49.082 --> 43:50.879
- I don't have a phone.

43:50.879 --> 43:51.712
- [Man] You don't have a phone,

43:51.712 --> 43:53.423
my five year old niece has a phone!

43:56.850 --> 44:00.450
- I have a phone but it's in my apartment.

44:00.450 --> 44:02.303
Would you please call the cops?

44:03.560 --> 44:05.340
- [Man] Sure, sure, yeah, yeah.

44:05.340 --> 44:06.770
Let's start with the basics, okay?

44:06.770 --> 44:08.420
What's your name?

44:08.420 --> 44:09.793
- Tara, Tara Mays.

44:10.760 --> 44:11.890
- [Man] I'm Kenny.

44:11.890 --> 44:13.190
But you can call me Kenny

44:13.190 --> 44:15.610
but I'd prefer Bullet.

44:15.610 --> 44:17.190
- Okay, thank you, Kenny.

44:17.190 --> 44:18.553
Bullet, thank you, Bullet.

44:19.400 --> 44:20.600
- [Kenny] Where are you?

44:22.151 --> 44:23.675
- I'm inside of an RV.

44:23.675 --> 44:26.020
- [Kenny] Yeah, (laughing) you said that,

44:26.020 --> 44:28.060
but where the fuck is the RV?

44:28.060 --> 44:28.893
- I don't know.

44:30.290 --> 44:31.760
- [Kenny] Wait a minute.

44:31.760 --> 44:33.800
You want me to call the cops

44:33.800 --> 44:35.390
and tell them that you've been kidnapped

44:35.390 --> 44:36.940
but I don't know where you are?

44:37.950 --> 44:40.490
How the hell are they gonna find you?

44:40.490 --> 44:42.210
No, no, no, no, see, this is how it works,

44:42.210 --> 44:44.240
I call the cops, they'll make a record,

44:44.240 --> 44:46.180
put my name on file.

44:46.180 --> 44:47.210
Then when they can't find you

44:47.210 --> 44:49.630
they'll put a note in my electronic file

44:49.630 --> 44:51.550
saying that I'm a crank caller.

44:51.550 --> 44:54.110
And then when I really
need the cops and call 'em,

44:54.110 --> 44:56.710
these guys are gonna laugh
at me and just, you know?

44:58.740 --> 45:01.040
- The police are gonna
interview my neighbors.

45:02.790 --> 45:05.780
Talk to Mrs. Olson, she
would have seen something.

45:05.780 --> 45:07.080
- [Kenny] How old are you?

45:08.290 --> 45:10.750
- I don't see how that fucking matters!

45:10.750 --> 45:12.030
- [Kenny] Are you over 18?

45:12.030 --> 45:14.760
Then the cops are gonna say
you had a right to disappear.

45:14.760 --> 45:17.420
They don't find any sign of
a crime at your apartment,

45:17.420 --> 45:18.420
they'll just blow it off,

45:18.420 --> 45:20.593
but you know, they'll know my name.

45:25.487 --> 45:27.470
- Then don't give 'em your name.

45:27.470 --> 45:28.930
Please, don't give them your name

45:28.930 --> 45:30.903
but call the fucking cops now!

45:39.320 --> 45:40.153
Hello?

45:41.640 --> 45:43.363
Bullet, hello?

45:46.410 --> 45:47.810
Bullet, are you still there?

45:49.683 --> 45:50.516
Oh god.

45:52.920 --> 45:54.837
You did it again, Tara.

45:56.712 --> 45:58.795
When will you ever learn?

46:13.121 --> 46:15.871
(radio clacking)

46:27.916 --> 46:29.690
Roger, I completely
understand what you're saying.

46:29.690 --> 46:33.193
- Ah, fuck you too. (laughing)

46:37.660 --> 46:38.493
Sorry.

46:41.250 --> 46:43.012
- We've both been in the same uniform and-

46:43.012 --> 46:44.617
- Yeah?

46:44.617 --> 46:46.770
But have you ever gotten
blood on your uniforms?

46:46.770 --> 46:47.603
No.

46:50.540 --> 46:54.173
Maybe a little of that sweet
sweat that runs down your back.

46:58.025 --> 47:00.550
(tense music)

47:00.550 --> 47:02.063
Ever killed anyone, Doc?

47:07.660 --> 47:10.470
- Roger, there's many
people in the military

47:10.470 --> 47:13.190
who perform invaluable duties, and

47:13.190 --> 47:16.690
all of these which-
(Roger laughing)

47:16.690 --> 47:20.167
- You've never even thought
about killing someone, have you?

47:21.660 --> 47:24.160
(gasping) No.

47:30.443 --> 47:31.276
- Okay Roger, we're here to talk about-

47:31.276 --> 47:33.150
- Yeah I know, we're
here to talk about me,

47:33.150 --> 47:34.240
I know, not what you think you've done

47:34.240 --> 47:35.860
or what you think you're capable of doing.

47:35.860 --> 47:36.710
I know, I get it.

47:37.958 --> 47:40.370
(sighing) So long as you
people have me locked up

47:40.370 --> 47:42.730
in this godforsaken building,

47:42.730 --> 47:45.530
rotting and waiting for what?

47:45.530 --> 47:48.513
Yes, I kill people,
civilians, yes, I get it.

47:50.750 --> 47:53.070
Right, isn't that why we're here?

47:54.570 --> 47:55.600
- [Tara] Well yes, but I'm here-

47:55.600 --> 47:57.580
- I killed those kids

47:57.580 --> 47:59.540
because God only knows which
one of those little bastards

47:59.540 --> 48:00.673
was gonna be a plant.

48:02.892 --> 48:05.020
Had I not killed those kids,

48:05.020 --> 48:07.366
and they'd gone on to kill the target,

48:07.366 --> 48:09.133
my men could have died.

48:10.750 --> 48:11.583
Get it?

48:13.900 --> 48:14.733
- Okay Roger, I think we're gonna-

48:14.733 --> 48:16.213
- And I will do it again.

48:18.820 --> 48:20.813
Isn't that what you really wanna know?

48:26.398 --> 48:29.148
(gasping) Oh no.

48:30.860 --> 48:33.113
You wanna know if I have nightmares.

48:35.700 --> 48:36.533
Right?

48:37.590 --> 48:39.453
And that if I'd do it again.

48:41.460 --> 48:43.210
Nightmares about putting
rounds to the heads

48:43.210 --> 48:44.623
of 10 year old kids.

48:46.440 --> 48:48.343
And if I would do it again.

48:50.800 --> 48:52.720
Yeah Doc, I would.

48:52.720 --> 48:54.430
And no, I don't have nightmares.

48:54.430 --> 48:56.240
I did what I had to do.

48:56.240 --> 48:58.253
I did what I was trained to do!

49:03.769 --> 49:08.769
You don't know shit. (scoffing)

49:14.053 --> 49:15.153
- I do know something.

49:18.313 --> 49:19.410
And I know we're not really here

49:19.410 --> 49:21.300
because you protected your team.

49:21.300 --> 49:22.890
We are here because of the allegations

49:22.890 --> 49:23.723
of your sexual-

49:23.723 --> 49:26.400
- You better watch your
fucking mouth, bitch!

49:26.400 --> 49:28.087
I could kill you right fucking now

49:28.087 --> 49:30.173
and there's nothing you
could do to stop me.

49:32.210 --> 49:34.167
You, you don't know me.

49:35.660 --> 49:37.663
- Roger please, I need you to calm down.

49:38.930 --> 49:40.027
Things are gonna go a lot easier on you

49:40.027 --> 49:41.283
if you do what I say.

49:44.643 --> 49:48.000
(music intensifying)

49:48.000 --> 49:48.903
- You killed me.

49:50.416 --> 49:51.660
(Tara gasping)

49:51.660 --> 49:52.813
You killed me!

49:57.480 --> 50:00.397
- (whimpering) No.

50:01.527 --> 50:03.338
That was not my fault.

50:03.338 --> 50:04.570
- Of course it's not my fault.

50:04.570 --> 50:06.540
From what you told me about Roger,

50:06.540 --> 50:07.840
he's a real piece of work.

50:09.470 --> 50:11.703
Psychopath, sociopath.

50:14.240 --> 50:16.360
(sighing) It's not your fault.

50:16.360 --> 50:18.000
If it was anybody's fault,

50:18.000 --> 50:20.450
it's the guards for having
not searched his cell.

50:23.996 --> 50:27.620
- Roger hung himself
in his room yesterday.

50:27.620 --> 50:31.853
And I didn't put him on suicide watch.

50:33.269 --> 50:34.610
I didn't think he was self-destructive.

50:34.610 --> 50:36.484
I didn't think he was gonna...

50:36.484 --> 50:37.540
(somber piano music)

50:37.540 --> 50:39.980
- You're given a certain amount of time

50:41.710 --> 50:44.073
to get to know and come
to your conclusion.

50:45.242 --> 50:47.020
But that's not your fault.

50:47.020 --> 50:50.120
Maybe if you had more time
or fewer cases, but...

50:51.940 --> 50:53.140
- No, I had enough time.

50:54.780 --> 50:56.283
But my conclusion was wrong.

51:00.790 --> 51:02.779
It's my fault that he's dead.

51:02.779 --> 51:04.240
I should have known.

51:12.218 --> 51:13.140
If Brian finds out,

51:13.140 --> 51:14.903
he's never gonna trust me again.

51:20.720 --> 51:22.800
He's always been so
skeptical about my work.

51:22.800 --> 51:24.740
And now this is...

51:32.210 --> 51:33.850
He doesn't think I'm
cut out to handle people

51:33.850 --> 51:34.810
when I'm so...

51:39.304 --> 51:41.554
When I'm so fragile myself.

51:58.334 --> 52:01.917
- [Brian] Tara, baby,
dinner's about ready!

52:07.790 --> 52:09.743
- [Man] Baby, come away with me.

52:10.840 --> 52:12.730
Leave that nutcase.

52:12.730 --> 52:14.090
You can get out.

52:14.090 --> 52:16.133
I can get my pension ready instead.

52:17.170 --> 52:19.743
You and me, we'll live
off the grid together.

52:28.130 --> 52:29.880
- Brian, that's not what you think.

52:38.490 --> 52:41.154
- Hey, what's happening?

52:41.154 --> 52:41.987
No, no!

52:44.693 --> 52:49.693
No! (sobbing)

52:49.693 --> 52:50.526
No, no!

52:52.548 --> 52:54.452
(somber music)

52:54.452 --> 52:58.136
I don't wanna live, I don't wanna live!

52:58.136 --> 53:02.336
No! (sobbing)

53:04.217 --> 53:06.815
- [Brian] Lay back, baby,
lay back baby, lay back.

53:06.815 --> 53:09.018
Lay back, baby, lay back.

53:09.018 --> 53:11.268
(thumping)

53:25.193 --> 53:28.340
(floor creaking)

53:28.340 --> 53:29.223
- It's not real.

53:30.130 --> 53:31.730
You're just examining your life.

53:33.170 --> 53:34.910
The bad things.

53:34.910 --> 53:36.960
- [Kenny] You have no idea where you are?

53:41.760 --> 53:42.593
- No.

53:43.770 --> 53:44.603
I don't know.

53:45.520 --> 53:47.180
- [Kenny] Right, anything in that RV

53:47.180 --> 53:48.543
to show who owns it?

53:49.760 --> 53:52.350
Maybe the photograph, name, registration,

53:52.350 --> 53:54.220
something personal, something I can run

53:54.220 --> 53:55.270
through the internet.

54:02.090 --> 54:04.753
- I know I'm in a field, a remote field.

54:06.770 --> 54:10.030
- [Kenny] Oh, sure, little miss militia.

54:10.030 --> 54:11.020
That narrows it right down.

54:11.020 --> 54:12.570
I'll call the NSA right now

54:12.570 --> 54:14.810
and have them pull up all
of their satellite photos

54:14.810 --> 54:15.850
for empty fields.

54:15.850 --> 54:17.537
Or why don't you just send
up a flare or something?

54:17.537 --> 54:19.960
- Look, I'm trying, okay?

54:19.960 --> 54:20.793
I'm trying.

54:25.050 --> 54:26.820
- [Kenny] Okay, okay, look.

54:26.820 --> 54:28.230
Search around.

54:28.230 --> 54:30.230
See if you can find
something in the RV, okay?

54:30.230 --> 54:31.370
I'm gonna call some buddies

54:31.370 --> 54:34.290
and see if they know anything.

54:34.290 --> 54:35.740
I'll talk to you later.

54:35.740 --> 54:36.843
- Wait.

54:36.843 --> 54:37.676
Bullet.

54:38.780 --> 54:40.180
Bullet, are you still there?

54:52.680 --> 54:53.513
Okay.

54:54.723 --> 54:55.556
Okay.

54:56.400 --> 54:57.233
Look around.

55:00.905 --> 55:04.572
(lightly suspenseful music)

55:07.069 --> 55:07.902
Okay.

55:14.230 --> 55:15.213
Timothy Harrison.

55:28.120 --> 55:29.410
Laura Kennington.

55:38.810 --> 55:39.836
Phone number.

55:39.836 --> 55:41.919
- [Kenny] You on the air?

55:44.490 --> 55:46.223
- Bullet, yeah, yeah, I'm here.

55:47.210 --> 55:49.340
- [Kenny] Okay, so here's the deal.

55:49.340 --> 55:51.313
No one has reported you missing.

55:54.460 --> 55:55.293
- What?

55:56.160 --> 55:57.010
What about Brian?

55:59.200 --> 56:00.790
It hasn't been on the news, nothing?

56:00.790 --> 56:01.623
Nothing?

56:01.623 --> 56:03.470
- [Kenny] Oh jeez Louise,
don't get your panties

56:03.470 --> 56:05.140
in a knot, huh?

56:05.140 --> 56:06.800
More hostages get themselves killed

56:06.800 --> 56:07.900
when their captors figure out

56:07.900 --> 56:10.370
that someone has reported them missing.

56:10.370 --> 56:13.860
Count yourself lucky that no
one has reported you missing.

56:13.860 --> 56:16.113
All right, now, did
you do like I told you?

56:17.131 --> 56:19.290
Did you search the place, find some names,

56:19.290 --> 56:21.687
something I can track down, anything?

56:23.370 --> 56:26.150
- Yeah, yeah, I have names.

56:26.150 --> 56:28.333
Timothy Harrison and Laura Kennington.

56:29.470 --> 56:31.983
- [Kenny] What kind of
fucked up name is Kennington?

56:32.910 --> 56:34.110
- I don't know, British?

56:35.000 --> 56:38.762
And I have a phone number.

56:38.762 --> 56:43.173
208-558-4848.

56:44.431 --> 56:47.120
- [Kenny] Hmm, well
that's not a local number.

56:47.120 --> 56:48.480
I'll check the area code.

56:48.480 --> 56:50.260
- I have a street address.

56:50.260 --> 56:53.423
6155 North Main Street.

56:54.617 --> 56:57.558
- [Kenny] You feel like
sharing the city with me?

56:57.558 --> 56:58.640
- It doesn't have a city.

56:58.640 --> 56:59.750
But it came with the phone number

56:59.750 --> 57:02.243
so it should be whatever area code 208 is.

57:03.620 --> 57:05.333
- [Kenny] Wow, hey, you're sharp.

57:06.420 --> 57:07.253
What else?

57:10.610 --> 57:12.160
- E. Jennings.

57:12.160 --> 57:13.542
- [Kenny] Wow.

57:13.542 --> 57:16.190
Now I wonder how many
E. Jennings there are.

57:16.190 --> 57:17.023
Anything else?

57:19.362 --> 57:20.520
- No, I stopped searching.

57:20.520 --> 57:22.263
I couldn't find anything.

57:25.037 --> 57:28.223
- At this very moment,
your name is Cassandra.

57:32.760 --> 57:33.823
My name is Bruce.

57:35.770 --> 57:37.170
- Wait.

57:37.170 --> 57:38.728
Wait, he said his name was Bruce

57:38.728 --> 57:39.960
and that mine was Cassandra.

57:39.960 --> 57:41.570
- [Kenny] Why the fuck
didn't you tell me that

57:41.570 --> 57:42.440
to begin with?

57:42.440 --> 57:43.490
- I don't know, I don't know.

57:43.490 --> 57:45.140
I just thought of that right now.

57:47.020 --> 57:47.853
Hey, you know what?

57:47.853 --> 57:49.340
Why don't you try getting kidnapped

57:49.340 --> 57:52.370
and having a chain on
your ankle, and, and...

57:52.370 --> 57:53.820
- [Kenny] What kind of chain?

57:55.450 --> 57:56.640
It's important.

57:56.640 --> 57:59.420
Everything you see, everything Bruce says,

57:59.420 --> 58:01.140
it's all important.

58:01.140 --> 58:02.920
Now what kind of chain?

58:02.920 --> 58:05.290
Big links, small links?

58:05.290 --> 58:06.350
And what kind of lock?

58:06.350 --> 58:07.923
Combination or key?

58:08.910 --> 58:10.830
- I don't know, it's a normal chain,

58:10.830 --> 58:13.000
it's small links.

58:13.000 --> 58:14.590
It's heavy.

58:14.590 --> 58:19.150
And a key lock, an old key lock.

58:19.150 --> 58:20.603
Like it's been used a lot.

58:23.000 --> 58:24.300
He's had a lot of victims.

58:25.810 --> 58:28.700
- [Kenny] Okay, okay, I'll
run over what you gave me.

58:28.700 --> 58:31.813
Just stay strong, I'll find ya.

58:36.930 --> 58:38.363
- Thank you so much, Bullet.

58:40.590 --> 58:41.770
I don't know what I would do

58:41.770 --> 58:43.777
if I wasn't talking to you right now.

58:46.420 --> 58:48.320
- [Kenny] Listen, give me a few hours.

59:01.820 --> 59:02.670
- Don't push him.

59:04.475 --> 59:06.142
He's your only hope.

59:13.072 --> 59:14.739
He's your only hope.

59:25.075 --> 59:28.102
(clattering)

59:28.102 --> 59:30.269
(buzzing)

59:31.760 --> 59:32.923
You have to trust me.

59:37.520 --> 59:38.703
- I didn't do it.

59:40.640 --> 59:41.540
- They have the other boot,

59:41.540 --> 59:43.040
I found this one in your room.

59:45.837 --> 59:47.254
- I didn't do it.

59:49.910 --> 59:51.730
- George, the wear pattern on this boot

59:51.730 --> 59:53.643
matches the one they have in evidence.

59:57.454 --> 59:58.553
- I didn't do it!

1:00:02.230 --> 1:00:03.880
- George, I'm trying to help you.

1:00:05.040 --> 1:00:05.873
Before any of this happened,

1:00:05.873 --> 1:00:08.683
I'm the one who helped you
deal with the loss of your son.

1:00:12.590 --> 1:00:13.690
- What was that again?

1:00:15.750 --> 1:00:17.220
Say that again?

1:00:17.220 --> 1:00:19.603
You were here to help me when my son died?

1:00:21.310 --> 1:00:22.520
You know how you helped me?

1:00:22.520 --> 1:00:24.240
You told me everything
happens for a reason.

1:00:24.240 --> 1:00:26.940
Now you tell me right now,
you tell me right now,

1:00:26.940 --> 1:00:29.390
what is the reason for a
six year old boy to die?

1:00:33.150 --> 1:00:35.573
- I can't help you if you don't help me.

1:00:37.720 --> 1:00:39.540
When I testify, I will have to tell them

1:00:39.540 --> 1:00:41.083
that you were under no stress.

1:00:43.190 --> 1:00:45.740
There was no good reason
for you to kill your wife,

1:00:46.620 --> 1:00:49.013
cut her up, and put her in the trash.

1:00:52.280 --> 1:00:54.323
- [George] I didn't kill Veronica!

1:01:03.880 --> 1:01:05.693
- They will give you the death penalty.

1:01:16.380 --> 1:01:18.870
- Yes, it was my knife.

1:01:18.870 --> 1:01:20.410
I know it was my knife,

1:01:20.410 --> 1:01:23.520
but it wasn't me, you have to believe me.

1:01:23.520 --> 1:01:24.743
I didn't...

1:01:28.012 --> 1:01:28.845
Kill her.

1:01:31.580 --> 1:01:33.553
- No one is going to believe you, George.

1:01:39.579 --> 1:01:40.900
But if you trust me...

1:01:49.200 --> 1:01:51.210
Tell me about how it
was your wife Veronica

1:01:51.210 --> 1:01:52.443
who left your son alone.

1:01:53.440 --> 1:01:55.683
George, tell me about,

1:01:57.150 --> 1:01:58.460
tell me about all those
nightmares you've had

1:01:58.460 --> 1:01:59.550
since his death.

1:01:59.550 --> 1:02:00.383
Tell me about-

1:02:00.383 --> 1:02:01.216
- Wait.

1:02:06.175 --> 1:02:08.790
(tense music)

1:02:08.790 --> 1:02:10.760
Are you asking me to lie?

1:02:10.760 --> 1:02:12.933
- If you don't lie, you
don't have any hope.

1:02:17.050 --> 1:02:17.883
He lied.

1:02:19.770 --> 1:02:20.870
And I wrote my report.

1:02:25.020 --> 1:02:27.270
And then they caught him in the lie.

1:02:29.750 --> 1:02:34.750
And now poor George is
set to fry. (laughing)

1:02:50.832 --> 1:02:53.499
(door creaking)

1:02:57.921 --> 1:03:00.588
(door slamming)

1:03:05.322 --> 1:03:06.322
- Cassandra.

1:03:09.550 --> 1:03:10.383
- Bruce?

1:03:12.642 --> 1:03:13.475
- Good.

1:03:14.780 --> 1:03:15.720
Very good.

1:03:16.650 --> 1:03:18.340
- Please let me go.

1:03:18.340 --> 1:03:19.173
Please.

1:03:25.960 --> 1:03:27.403
- I need you to change.

1:03:28.951 --> 1:03:30.230
- What?

1:03:30.230 --> 1:03:31.063
Why?

1:03:32.220 --> 1:03:33.330
- It's what I want.

1:03:34.529 --> 1:03:37.113
- Please, tell me why
you want me to change.

1:03:38.490 --> 1:03:40.090
- Because we're meeting friends.

1:03:42.032 --> 1:03:43.530
- And you don't think
your friends will like me

1:03:43.530 --> 1:03:45.053
in this dress, Brian?

1:03:47.074 --> 1:03:50.080
- Babe, we're going to Applebee's,

1:03:50.080 --> 1:03:51.280
not the Playboy mansion.

1:03:53.540 --> 1:03:54.623
- I've had a bad day.

1:03:57.427 --> 1:03:58.427
I've had a bad week.

1:04:00.180 --> 1:04:01.763
It's been a bad fucking month.

1:04:05.492 --> 1:04:07.997
The whole year's been fucking bad, Brian.

1:04:09.590 --> 1:04:11.640
So I'm gonna wear this fucking dress now!

1:04:18.300 --> 1:04:19.133
Sorry, baby.

1:04:22.166 --> 1:04:27.166
How did I?

1:04:31.483 --> 1:04:34.900
(electronic dance music)

1:04:50.650 --> 1:04:52.340
He's trying to wear you down with lights

1:04:52.340 --> 1:04:53.303
and loud music.

1:04:55.140 --> 1:04:57.143
Remember the story of Noriega in Panama?

1:05:00.180 --> 1:05:02.650
He finally surrendered
after PSYOPS bombarded him

1:05:02.650 --> 1:05:05.140
with lights and heavy metal music.

1:05:05.140 --> 1:05:06.783
Why is he trying to break me?

1:05:08.870 --> 1:05:10.683
- [Kenny] Yo, Tara, you on the air?

1:05:14.280 --> 1:05:16.120
- Yes, yes I'm here.

1:05:16.120 --> 1:05:16.953
He was just here.

1:05:16.953 --> 1:05:18.308
He's using lights and music and-

1:05:18.308 --> 1:05:20.071
- [Kenny] Yeah, you know, I
try them too, with my dates.

1:05:20.071 --> 1:05:21.960
You know, a little romantic
music, candlelight,

1:05:21.960 --> 1:05:23.840
little some, you know, Kenny G.

1:05:23.840 --> 1:05:24.770
Puts 'em in the mood.

1:05:24.770 --> 1:05:27.400
- He's not trying to date me, Bullet.

1:05:27.400 --> 1:05:29.766
- Oh, yeah, right, sorry, sorry,

1:05:29.766 --> 1:05:31.360
didn't mean to.

1:05:31.360 --> 1:05:33.860
- Have you found out
anything else about this guy?

1:05:35.220 --> 1:05:37.950
What about the names I gave you, anything?

1:05:37.950 --> 1:05:40.283
- [Kenny] Yeah, but you won't like it.

1:05:41.487 --> 1:05:42.643
- I don't care, tell me.

1:05:43.660 --> 1:05:45.993
- [Kenny] Sometimes what you
don't know won't hurt you.

1:05:47.840 --> 1:05:49.453
- Got it, Kenny, just tell me.

1:05:50.550 --> 1:05:51.620
- [Kenny] Okay, you just remember,

1:05:51.620 --> 1:05:53.640
I gave you the chance not to know.

1:05:53.640 --> 1:05:55.300
- Please, just tell me.

1:05:55.300 --> 1:05:56.133
- [Kenny] Okay.

1:05:57.070 --> 1:05:59.470
I'll start with the names you gave me.

1:05:59.470 --> 1:06:01.160
Timothy Harrison,

1:06:01.160 --> 1:06:03.050
he was five years old
(suspenseful music)

1:06:03.050 --> 1:06:04.560
when he went missing.

1:06:04.560 --> 1:06:05.610
They never found him.

1:06:06.790 --> 1:06:08.130
- How did he end up in here?

1:06:08.130 --> 1:06:10.040
- [Kenny] His family was
at a campground in Georgia.

1:06:10.040 --> 1:06:11.990
Someone snatched him out of their tent.

1:06:14.170 --> 1:06:15.970
- He used this RV to kidnap a child.

1:06:16.940 --> 1:06:19.210
- [Kenny] Laura Kennington,
she went missing

1:06:19.210 --> 1:06:20.043
when she was 18.

1:06:20.945 --> 1:06:23.533
She was camping with some
friends in Louisiana.

1:06:26.680 --> 1:06:27.513
- He's using this RV to-

1:06:27.513 --> 1:06:29.730
- [Kenny] Yeah, her
parents committed suicide,

1:06:29.730 --> 1:06:30.593
or so they say.

1:06:32.670 --> 1:06:35.330
A month after Laura went missing,

1:06:35.330 --> 1:06:38.090
the neighbor found her
parents in their bedrooms

1:06:38.090 --> 1:06:40.133
with bullet wounds in their heads.

1:06:42.434 --> 1:06:46.560
- And you don't believe
it was suicide, why?

1:06:46.560 --> 1:06:48.430
- [Kenny] Yeah, yeah,
yeah, they left a note

1:06:48.430 --> 1:06:50.920
saying some bullshit about
they had nothing to live for,

1:06:50.920 --> 1:06:52.180
but I...

1:06:52.180 --> 1:06:53.013
- But what?

1:06:54.710 --> 1:06:56.313
- [Kenny] They didn't find the gun.

1:06:57.270 --> 1:06:58.320
You don't put a bullet in your head

1:06:58.320 --> 1:07:00.283
then get up and you know, bury the gun.

1:07:01.500 --> 1:07:03.007
They find the gun next to you.

1:07:08.063 --> 1:07:10.090
- So you think he kidnapped Laura,

1:07:10.090 --> 1:07:11.980
went back to her house,
picked up some things

1:07:11.980 --> 1:07:13.130
and killed her parents?

1:07:14.210 --> 1:07:15.773
- [Kenny] That's what I would think.

1:07:18.030 --> 1:07:19.310
- What about the phone number I gave you,

1:07:19.310 --> 1:07:21.130
the street address?

1:07:21.130 --> 1:07:23.570
- [Kenny] It comes back to
an Idaho State Park Office.

1:07:23.570 --> 1:07:27.260
The address looks like it
was a mail drop, you know?

1:07:27.260 --> 1:07:28.830
Just a bunch of PO boxes,

1:07:28.830 --> 1:07:31.660
but people were using
it as an office address.

1:07:31.660 --> 1:07:32.493
- Idaho?

1:07:33.370 --> 1:07:35.670
- [Kenny] I looked at the State Park.

1:07:35.670 --> 1:07:37.610
There'd been over 15 missing persons

1:07:37.610 --> 1:07:40.320
since early 1990s.

1:07:40.320 --> 1:07:41.453
All from that park.

1:07:43.722 --> 1:07:45.690
- He's using that RV to...

1:07:45.690 --> 1:07:48.410
- [Kenny] Funny thing,
there was a park ranger

1:07:48.410 --> 1:07:51.290
by the name of Emmett Jennings.

1:07:51.290 --> 1:07:52.220
E. Jennings?

1:07:52.220 --> 1:07:53.770
- So he's working with someone.

1:07:54.800 --> 1:07:56.383
- [Kenny] Well that's what it looks like.

1:07:57.523 --> 1:08:00.523
(crickets chirping)

1:08:08.704 --> 1:08:11.940
- There's something you're not telling me.

1:08:11.940 --> 1:08:13.290
What are you not telling me?

1:08:13.290 --> 1:08:15.710
- [Kenny] It's something
of an urban legend,

1:08:15.710 --> 1:08:17.410
probably just a bunch of bullshit.

1:08:18.260 --> 1:08:19.258
- Tell me.

1:08:19.258 --> 1:08:21.253
- [Kenny] (sighing) Okay, here goes.

1:08:22.639 --> 1:08:24.130
A couple of teenage girls reported

1:08:24.130 --> 1:08:25.969
that they were camping around Jacksonville

1:08:25.969 --> 1:08:28.697
and some older guy camped next to 'em.

1:08:30.200 --> 1:08:31.952
At first, you know, he was helpful.

1:08:32.819 --> 1:08:34.069
He said his name was Bruce

1:08:34.069 --> 1:08:36.673
and said he had a teenage
daughter named Tiffany.

1:08:38.468 --> 1:08:40.440
- His daughter's name is Tiffany.

1:08:40.440 --> 1:08:41.809
- [Kenny] Yeah.

1:08:41.809 --> 1:08:45.753
Son's name was Billy and his
wife's name was Cassandra.

1:08:47.219 --> 1:08:49.763
- Son's name was Billy,
his wife's name was...

1:08:50.755 --> 1:08:52.673
He thinks I'm his wife.

1:08:54.077 --> 1:08:56.360
- [Kenny] Well he was in an old RV.

1:08:56.360 --> 1:08:57.830
Anyway, the girls got into the RV

1:08:57.830 --> 1:08:59.889
and he gave them some Mary Jane.

1:08:59.889 --> 1:09:01.450
And they started to get stoned

1:09:01.450 --> 1:09:03.067
and he started coming on to 'em.

1:09:04.010 --> 1:09:05.300
The girls said that he told them

1:09:05.300 --> 1:09:07.350
that he had been in the army.

1:09:07.350 --> 1:09:09.200
Special Forces,

1:09:09.200 --> 1:09:11.700
when he pulled out some
logging chains and a lock.

1:09:12.830 --> 1:09:14.490
- So did they run?

1:09:14.490 --> 1:09:15.750
- [Kenny] Yeah, they ran.

1:09:15.750 --> 1:09:17.410
Other people in the country have reported

1:09:17.410 --> 1:09:19.490
seeing Bruce and the RV.

1:09:19.490 --> 1:09:21.389
- Is that it, that's all to the story?

1:09:23.080 --> 1:09:25.760
- [Kenny] Well, I talked to some buddies

1:09:25.760 --> 1:09:28.760
and they said Bruce is a collector.

1:09:28.760 --> 1:09:29.860
- What does that mean?

1:09:31.870 --> 1:09:35.389
- [Kenny] Yeah, from what the girls said,

1:09:35.389 --> 1:09:37.450
while Bruce was on Operation Desert Storm,

1:09:37.450 --> 1:09:40.170
his family back in Iowa was killed

1:09:40.170 --> 1:09:41.563
in a robbery gone bad.

1:09:42.895 --> 1:09:45.194
- But his wife, his
wife's name was Cassandra?

1:09:47.170 --> 1:09:48.819
- [Kenny] Yeah, that's the story.

1:09:49.710 --> 1:09:52.380
He's trying to collect the
family he lost, you get it?

1:09:52.380 --> 1:09:56.389
Young son Billy, and the
teenage daughter Tiffany.

1:09:56.389 --> 1:09:57.820
Fuck me.

1:09:57.820 --> 1:09:59.870
I knew a Tiffany once,
she was smoking hot.

1:09:59.870 --> 1:10:01.969
She had these tits that were sticking out.

1:10:04.770 --> 1:10:06.219
- And the location of the RV?

1:10:07.777 --> 1:10:09.280
Do you have any leads on where I am?

1:10:09.280 --> 1:10:10.112
- [Kenny] Look.

1:10:11.389 --> 1:10:13.270
I don't want you to give up hope, huh?

1:10:13.270 --> 1:10:16.120
You give up hope and that's
when you start thinking about...

1:10:17.450 --> 1:10:18.830
- Putting a bullet through my head?

1:10:18.830 --> 1:10:20.660
- [Kenny] Well, you know what I mean.

1:10:20.660 --> 1:10:22.530
I'm still checking on the information.

1:10:22.530 --> 1:10:24.480
I'll find you, you gotta believe in me.

1:10:31.780 --> 1:10:32.780
- Thanks, Bullet.

1:10:34.677 --> 1:10:37.100
- [Kenny] The only time you give up hope

1:10:37.100 --> 1:10:38.100
is when you're dead.

1:10:39.320 --> 1:10:40.850
Now stay strong, okay?

1:10:40.850 --> 1:10:43.343
Keep the faith, I'll talk to you later.

1:10:49.940 --> 1:10:50.773
- Okay.

1:10:51.840 --> 1:10:52.900
- [Kenny] Okay.

1:10:52.900 --> 1:10:56.053
Turn off the radio and I'll
contact you at sunrise, okay?

1:10:59.510 --> 1:11:01.123
- Yeah, yeah, sunrise.

1:11:10.670 --> 1:11:12.862
Okay, so Bruce was in Special Forces.

1:11:14.280 --> 1:11:16.900
You've counseled a lot
of Special Forces types.

1:11:16.900 --> 1:11:18.850
Use what you know to find his weakness.

1:11:19.760 --> 1:11:22.690
He lost a wife and son
while he was a soldier.

1:11:22.690 --> 1:11:24.860
A young son and a teenage daughter.

1:11:24.860 --> 1:11:25.809
The perfect family.

1:11:26.990 --> 1:11:28.500
He thinks the army fucked him over

1:11:28.500 --> 1:11:30.350
by not protecting them, play to that.

1:11:31.350 --> 1:11:32.480
He might have his new wife

1:11:32.480 --> 1:11:35.620
but you can tell him
where to get the children.

1:11:35.620 --> 1:11:37.270
Play the role of the loving wife.

1:11:42.090 --> 1:11:43.112
The Lima Syndrome,

1:11:44.120 --> 1:11:46.770
where the abductor develops
sympathy for his hostage.

1:11:57.170 --> 1:11:58.719
- He's not smart enough to win,

1:12:00.210 --> 1:12:01.559
because he doesn't know me.

1:12:06.350 --> 1:12:08.350
I know every mind game there is to know.

1:12:12.752 --> 1:12:13.919
I'm gonna win.

1:12:23.572 --> 1:12:26.580
(laughing)

1:12:26.580 --> 1:12:28.603
You were absolutely brilliant, Frank,

1:12:30.460 --> 1:12:32.809
detailing how it was the army
who turned you into a rapist

1:12:32.809 --> 1:12:34.333
if in fact you ever were one.

1:12:35.540 --> 1:12:37.740
I must admit, it was
one of my better ideas.

1:12:40.264 --> 1:12:42.170
- What happens now?

1:12:42.170 --> 1:12:45.570
- Well now, you get a
dishonorable discharge,

1:12:45.570 --> 1:12:47.702
two years in a halfway house, and,

1:12:50.870 --> 1:12:52.670
we continue our counseling sessions.

1:12:54.510 --> 1:12:56.610
Congratulations, Frank, you're a free man.

1:12:57.987 --> 1:12:58.820
- Free?

1:12:59.977 --> 1:13:01.782
What about what I've done?

1:13:01.782 --> 1:13:03.563
What about the victims?

1:13:06.290 --> 1:13:08.750
- Well, a colleague of
mine who owed me a favor

1:13:08.750 --> 1:13:12.620
conducted the interviews
of the alleged victims.

1:13:12.620 --> 1:13:15.030
And, well I don't think the officers

1:13:15.030 --> 1:13:17.120
of the current marshal board
were particularly pleased

1:13:17.120 --> 1:13:18.780
to hear that the victims were,

1:13:18.780 --> 1:13:21.733
for a lack of clinical terms, whores.

1:13:26.080 --> 1:13:27.787
- But that doesn't make any sense.

1:13:33.420 --> 1:13:34.253
- Frank.

1:13:35.800 --> 1:13:36.633
You're free.

1:13:38.450 --> 1:13:39.820
And based on my observations,

1:13:39.820 --> 1:13:42.410
the local DA also agreed
that you will not be required

1:13:42.410 --> 1:13:45.593
to either report or
register as a sex offender.

1:13:47.552 --> 1:13:50.052
(eerie music)

1:13:52.430 --> 1:13:54.930
Now you can go out there
and get that daycare job.

1:13:56.700 --> 1:13:59.137
Just like you always dreamed about.

1:14:01.251 --> 1:14:02.084
- Really?

1:14:04.337 --> 1:14:07.811
I'm really free?

1:14:07.811 --> 1:14:08.894
- Yes, Frank.

1:14:11.568 --> 1:14:13.151
You're really free.

1:14:15.246 --> 1:14:17.543
- You know, I raped all those women.

1:14:18.960 --> 1:14:20.770
They weren't whores.

1:14:20.770 --> 1:14:22.050
But what I did to them,

1:14:23.243 --> 1:14:27.093
that was nothing compared to
what I did to these children.

1:14:31.210 --> 1:14:32.454
Free?

1:14:32.454 --> 1:14:34.050
(music intensifying)

1:14:34.050 --> 1:14:36.115
Maybe death will set me free.

1:14:36.115 --> 1:14:36.948
- Frank, no!

1:14:36.948 --> 1:14:41.948
(gun firing)
(Tara gasping)

1:14:50.480 --> 1:14:52.410
You're a trained psychologist.

1:14:52.410 --> 1:14:53.500
You have listened to sad stories

1:14:53.500 --> 1:14:55.760
from hundreds of crazy people.

1:14:55.760 --> 1:14:56.773
You can do this.

1:14:57.800 --> 1:14:59.200
Because you're much smarter.

1:15:01.693 --> 1:15:02.527
Okay.

1:15:03.990 --> 1:15:05.823
- You were right, Doc.

1:15:07.730 --> 1:15:09.860
I just need to see how it felt

1:15:09.860 --> 1:15:12.306
and it felt fucking amazing.

1:15:12.306 --> 1:15:14.102
- You fucking bitch!

1:15:14.102 --> 1:15:17.222
(knife slashing)
(grunting)

1:15:17.222 --> 1:15:19.555
(screaming)

1:15:22.760 --> 1:15:25.116
You fucking bitch!

1:15:25.116 --> 1:15:27.366
It will never fucking stop!

1:15:28.821 --> 1:15:31.154
(screaming)

1:15:33.282 --> 1:15:34.282
- Cassandra.

1:15:38.308 --> 1:15:39.891
- Help me, help me.

1:15:44.734 --> 1:15:47.317
(thudding)

1:15:47.317 --> 1:15:50.317
(light eerie music)

1:15:56.219 --> 1:16:00.178
(light relaxing music)

1:16:00.178 --> 1:16:01.011
- Mmm.

1:16:04.326 --> 1:16:05.159
Baby.

1:16:07.217 --> 1:16:09.413
You've really outdone yourself.

1:16:13.639 --> 1:16:14.563
- Outdone myself?

1:16:16.870 --> 1:16:20.230
Well I guess that's my ultimate
duty in this life, right?

1:16:20.230 --> 1:16:21.993
To keep you completely satisfied.

1:16:22.980 --> 1:16:24.300
- No.

1:16:24.300 --> 1:16:26.066
No, that's not what I was saying.

1:16:26.066 --> 1:16:27.816
Just, I loved dinner.

1:16:30.592 --> 1:16:32.259
It was great.

1:16:32.259 --> 1:16:34.853
- (laughing) It's good.

1:16:37.750 --> 1:16:38.583
It's good.

1:16:39.620 --> 1:16:41.570
You were always a good cook, Cassandra.

1:16:45.710 --> 1:16:47.210
You should eat while it's hot.

1:16:49.790 --> 1:16:51.590
Unless you like eating those snacks.

1:16:57.010 --> 1:16:58.309
Did the kids behave today?

1:17:00.680 --> 1:17:03.063
- Oh, well, you know Billy,

1:17:05.469 --> 1:17:07.930
he's six and he thinks he
should be driving already.

1:17:07.930 --> 1:17:08.763
- Yeah.

1:17:09.700 --> 1:17:10.532
Yeah.

1:17:11.680 --> 1:17:14.487
- And Tiffany, well she wants a new dress.

1:17:19.781 --> 1:17:21.698
- Just like her mother.

1:17:23.068 --> 1:17:25.568
(eerie music)

1:17:27.910 --> 1:17:28.743
- So.

1:17:30.105 --> 1:17:31.763
You know, I've told you about my day.

1:17:32.797 --> 1:17:34.860
About, well, Ms. Peterson

1:17:36.110 --> 1:17:41.110
asking me to prescribe her
husband Viagra, you know

1:17:42.050 --> 1:17:42.883
how that goes,

1:17:42.883 --> 1:17:44.983
hopefully that never happens to us, but...

1:17:46.490 --> 1:17:49.797
Anyways, let's talk
about you for once, hm?

1:17:50.785 --> 1:17:52.202
How was your day?

1:17:54.582 --> 1:17:55.415
- Really?

1:17:58.261 --> 1:18:00.969
You know everything I do is classified.

1:18:00.969 --> 1:18:02.163
Do you really wanna risk me losing my job

1:18:02.163 --> 1:18:03.993
just so we can bond over them?

1:18:12.508 --> 1:18:17.508
(laughing) The look on
your face right now.

1:18:18.740 --> 1:18:19.573
Bruce?

1:18:21.040 --> 1:18:23.090
I think after breakfast,

1:18:23.090 --> 1:18:25.040
we should take a drive like we used to.

1:18:30.450 --> 1:18:31.653
- We never took drives.

1:18:34.200 --> 1:18:35.350
You always got carsick.

1:18:38.485 --> 1:18:40.320
You won't even go camping with me.

1:18:43.186 --> 1:18:46.653
You said that's for redneck hillbillies.

1:18:53.240 --> 1:18:54.073
- Really?

1:18:58.880 --> 1:19:00.813
I never know when you're joking or not.

1:19:03.469 --> 1:19:07.020
It's like you're just trying to play some

1:19:07.020 --> 1:19:08.320
freaky mind games with me.

1:19:09.820 --> 1:19:13.032
Walking on eggshells, not
knowing if I'm gonna offend you

1:19:13.032 --> 1:19:16.680
or if I'm gonna say the wrong thing

1:19:16.680 --> 1:19:18.330
and you're just gonna snap on me.

1:19:23.170 --> 1:19:26.403
- I think after breakfast, which
you did a wonderful job at,

1:19:27.920 --> 1:19:29.610
we need to go pick up Billy and Tiffany

1:19:29.610 --> 1:19:30.803
from my sister's.

1:19:38.889 --> 1:19:40.139
- Do you think I'm crazy?

1:19:42.170 --> 1:19:43.313
- No, of course, not.

1:19:45.930 --> 1:19:47.430
I'm just reminding you that

1:19:48.780 --> 1:19:51.593
Billy and Tiffany spent
the night at my sister's

1:19:51.593 --> 1:19:53.143
and we need to go pick them up.

1:20:00.380 --> 1:20:04.653
- Tiffany was raped and gutted.

1:20:08.520 --> 1:20:10.973
Billy was hung from the kitchen light.

1:20:13.250 --> 1:20:14.223
They're both dead.

1:20:15.930 --> 1:20:16.763
- [Brian] What?

1:20:17.610 --> 1:20:20.493
- Look, Brian, you're a doctor, right?

1:20:21.704 --> 1:20:23.980
And you treat the bodies of your clients.

1:20:23.980 --> 1:20:26.754
Sort of like how a mechanic
works on a vehicle.

1:20:26.754 --> 1:20:27.833
- (laughing) A mechanic?

1:20:28.809 --> 1:20:31.389
No, I'm much more qualified

1:20:31.389 --> 1:20:34.280
and higher above a mechanic.
- Whereas I treat the minds

1:20:34.280 --> 1:20:35.500
of my clients.

1:20:35.500 --> 1:20:36.830
- My pay grade is-
- Okay?

1:20:36.830 --> 1:20:39.809
You can't see the mind.
- Skyrocketing fast.

1:20:39.809 --> 1:20:41.430
- That makes diagnosis
a lot more difficult

1:20:41.430 --> 1:20:43.639
than checking to see
whether Mr. Peterson's dick

1:20:43.639 --> 1:20:44.678
is up or down.

1:20:44.678 --> 1:20:46.610
It's hard, it's a trick.
- Okay, it's more complicated

1:20:46.610 --> 1:20:48.080
than just looking at a dick.

1:20:48.080 --> 1:20:50.782
- I have to know
everything about my client.

1:20:52.496 --> 1:20:56.063
(tense music)
- See, this is my party.

1:20:57.809 --> 1:20:58.653
Not your party.

1:20:59.870 --> 1:21:02.553
We do what I wanna do, not you.

1:21:03.666 --> 1:21:05.389
You wanna play mind games?

1:21:07.003 --> 1:21:08.643
Then I'll strip you naked,

1:21:10.410 --> 1:21:13.273
bend you over this table, and
fuck you with a broomstick.

1:21:20.700 --> 1:21:22.702
Best you eat this while it's hot.

1:21:24.980 --> 1:21:27.574
What you don't eat, I will toss.

1:21:27.574 --> 1:21:28.594
- Right, right, right.

1:21:28.594 --> 1:21:29.428
You're giving me
- Why don't you shut up you

1:21:29.428 --> 1:21:30.261
might just learn something.
- Fucking anxiety!

1:21:30.261 --> 1:21:32.740
You're giving me anxiety.

1:21:32.740 --> 1:21:33.573
Please, can we?
- You should fucking shut up

1:21:33.573 --> 1:21:34.406
you actually learn something.
- Can we have

1:21:34.406 --> 1:21:35.405
a normal conversation for once?

1:21:35.405 --> 1:21:36.237
- No you be quiet,

1:21:36.237 --> 1:21:37.357
and you shut up.
- We'll just have fun.

1:21:37.357 --> 1:21:41.100
- If you fucking shut up you
would actually learn something.

1:21:41.100 --> 1:21:41.950
What do you want?

1:21:46.573 --> 1:21:49.740
- I want to eat my breakfast in peace.

1:21:53.520 --> 1:21:54.353
Now eat.

1:21:56.700 --> 1:21:57.603
Or get fucked.

1:21:59.853 --> 1:22:01.333
It don't make no difference to me.

1:22:05.654 --> 1:22:08.419
- You're so on edge all the time.

1:22:08.419 --> 1:22:10.818
You're gonna make me blow
my fucking brains out.

1:22:17.111 --> 1:22:20.693
- I wonder who would
be the worse for that?

1:22:27.130 --> 1:22:28.543
Excuse me, I need some air.

1:22:36.540 --> 1:22:37.990
- I'll have to blindfold you.

1:22:40.549 --> 1:22:42.377
- Yeah that's okay, I just need some air.

1:23:00.827 --> 1:23:03.577
(birds chirping)

1:23:07.800 --> 1:23:09.112
If I promise not to look,

1:23:12.192 --> 1:23:13.791
will you take the blindfold off?

1:23:18.290 --> 1:23:19.490
- When I went to Kuwait,

1:23:20.710 --> 1:23:23.053
they promise me that my
family would be safe.

1:23:27.059 --> 1:23:27.950
Promises are like

1:23:29.830 --> 1:23:30.702
toilet paper.

1:23:32.500 --> 1:23:33.850
It's nice when you need it.

1:23:35.889 --> 1:23:37.463
But when you wipe your ass,

1:23:39.469 --> 1:23:41.112
the promise is covered in shit.

1:23:45.990 --> 1:23:47.469
And it's only good to flush

1:23:47.469 --> 1:23:49.202
along with all of the other shit.

1:23:54.800 --> 1:23:56.362
- Very visual example.

1:23:57.250 --> 1:23:58.753
Thank you so much for sharing.

1:24:01.680 --> 1:24:03.910
- I think you've had enough fresh air.

1:24:03.910 --> 1:24:04.743
Let's go.

1:24:04.743 --> 1:24:07.160
(chain clacking)

1:24:07.160 --> 1:24:08.460
- [Tara] Please let me go.

1:24:13.273 --> 1:24:14.107
- I can't.

1:24:18.910 --> 1:24:20.510
- I know where you can get a son

1:24:21.520 --> 1:24:22.353
and a daughter.

1:24:24.040 --> 1:24:26.210
And a much more beautiful wife.

1:24:26.210 --> 1:24:27.510
- More beautiful than you?

1:24:30.820 --> 1:24:32.553
- Yes, much more beautiful than me.

1:24:35.414 --> 1:24:37.683
And she has a son and a daughter.

1:24:39.536 --> 1:24:40.534
It's everything you want,

1:24:40.534 --> 1:24:42.143
it's everything you've
been trying to find.

1:24:47.170 --> 1:24:48.270
I can't have children.

1:24:54.040 --> 1:24:54.940
- What's her name?

1:24:57.710 --> 1:24:58.543
- Julie.

1:25:00.340 --> 1:25:01.719
I can give you her address.

1:25:01.719 --> 1:25:04.143
I can tell you how to get
to her and her children.

1:25:20.230 --> 1:25:21.397
- We'll see, maybe.

1:25:32.891 --> 1:25:35.558
(door slamming)

1:25:39.300 --> 1:25:41.050
- Yeah, that's it.

1:25:41.050 --> 1:25:43.430
Give him something to think about.

1:25:43.430 --> 1:25:45.309
Why go after the wife,
the son and daughter,

1:25:45.309 --> 1:25:47.010
when you can get the whole family?

1:25:55.830 --> 1:25:57.340
Bullet.

1:25:57.340 --> 1:25:59.170
Kenny, Bullet, it's me, Tara.

1:25:59.170 --> 1:26:00.003
Are you there?

1:26:01.055 --> 1:26:03.490
- [Kenny] I've been waiting all morning!

1:26:03.490 --> 1:26:07.309
- Sorry, Bruce came in
and brought me breakfast.

1:26:07.309 --> 1:26:08.620
- [Kenny] Nice, nice, terrific.

1:26:08.620 --> 1:26:09.452
I hope you enjoyed it.

1:26:09.452 --> 1:26:10.969
Are you two planning a wedding?

1:26:13.410 --> 1:26:14.910
- Do you have any information?

1:26:15.749 --> 1:26:17.700
Any news on where the RV might be?

1:26:17.700 --> 1:26:20.889
Please, anything, just
give me some good news.

1:26:20.889 --> 1:26:22.059
- [Kenny] This is the bad news.

1:26:22.059 --> 1:26:23.540
Looking through the police reports,

1:26:23.540 --> 1:26:25.280
- Police reports?

1:26:25.280 --> 1:26:27.990
- [Kenny] Yeah, listen, I
got a buddy on the inside.

1:26:27.990 --> 1:26:30.969
Seems as though that RV is
something of a community vehicle

1:26:30.969 --> 1:26:33.433
for serial killers.

1:26:34.840 --> 1:26:38.880
Sorry, it's passed from one
serial killer to another.

1:26:38.880 --> 1:26:39.750
Not that I'm scaring ya,

1:26:39.750 --> 1:26:41.070
but if you believe in ghosts

1:26:41.070 --> 1:26:43.680
then your RV should be packed full of 'em

1:26:43.680 --> 1:26:45.360
'cause there's been a
lot of killings inside

1:26:45.360 --> 1:26:47.530
and a lot of,

1:26:47.530 --> 1:26:50.353
well you know, the stuff that
goes on before the killing.

1:26:51.650 --> 1:26:53.350
- So you can't track its location?

1:26:54.680 --> 1:26:55.870
- [Kenny] That's a negative.

1:26:55.870 --> 1:26:57.130
You're in a field, right?

1:26:57.130 --> 1:26:59.467
Can you tell me something about it?

1:27:00.750 --> 1:27:02.020
- He took me outside earlier

1:27:02.020 --> 1:27:03.940
but I had something on my face.

1:27:03.940 --> 1:27:05.413
- [Kenny] Jeez, are you that ugly?

1:27:06.880 --> 1:27:08.880
- Bullet, I couldn't see anything, okay?

1:27:09.780 --> 1:27:11.860
- [Kenny] Did you smell anything?

1:27:11.860 --> 1:27:14.260
I don't know, like the smell of alfalfa,

1:27:14.260 --> 1:27:17.230
corn, pig shit, something else to help.

1:27:17.230 --> 1:27:19.513
Did you hear cows, maybe horses, anything?

1:27:20.969 --> 1:27:21.803
- Amaranth.

1:27:23.540 --> 1:27:24.643
I smelled Amaranth.

1:27:25.809 --> 1:27:28.300
Everywhere I turned, I could smell that.

1:27:28.300 --> 1:27:29.653
- [Kenny] Amaranth?

1:27:29.653 --> 1:27:31.540
Well if you smelled it
from every direction

1:27:31.540 --> 1:27:33.603
then it could be a landscaper.

1:27:34.900 --> 1:27:35.870
Okay, anything else?

1:27:35.870 --> 1:27:37.719
Think, did you hear a train,

1:27:37.719 --> 1:27:39.333
maybe a airplane flew over.

1:27:40.340 --> 1:27:42.440
- Yes, yes, there was a airplane.

1:27:42.440 --> 1:27:43.840
- [Kenny] When?

1:27:43.840 --> 1:27:46.070
- I don't know, 10 minutes ago.

1:27:46.070 --> 1:27:48.620
And it was loud, like a commercial jet.

1:27:48.620 --> 1:27:51.120
- [Kenny] Okay, okay, this
is good, this is good.

1:27:51.120 --> 1:27:53.650
A landscape business that raises Amaranth

1:27:53.650 --> 1:27:56.993
and is in the flight
path of a commercial jet.

1:27:58.222 --> 1:27:59.300
Think, use your head.

1:27:59.300 --> 1:28:00.900
What else did you hear or smell?

1:28:05.800 --> 1:28:07.010
- There were birds.

1:28:07.010 --> 1:28:08.670
Like they were high above me.

1:28:08.670 --> 1:28:11.103
But there were birds, lots of them.

1:28:11.103 --> 1:28:13.440
- [Kenny] Okay, okay,
okay, good, good, good.

1:28:13.440 --> 1:28:16.160
A field bordered by tall
trees, this is good.

1:28:16.160 --> 1:28:17.510
- Yeah, yeah, this is good.

1:28:24.300 --> 1:28:25.133
Bullet.

1:28:27.410 --> 1:28:28.463
Hey, Bullet.

1:28:30.450 --> 1:28:31.420
Are you not telling me something?

1:28:31.420 --> 1:28:32.253
What's going on?

1:28:34.700 --> 1:28:36.300
- [Kenny] You really wanna know?

1:28:38.360 --> 1:28:39.460
- Yeah, yeah, tell me.

1:28:40.410 --> 1:28:44.139
- [Kenny] The way all these
serial killers, like Bruce,

1:28:44.139 --> 1:28:45.950
have been able to keep killing people

1:28:45.950 --> 1:28:48.380
is that they either hold their captive

1:28:48.380 --> 1:28:50.550
for a maximum of four days

1:28:50.550 --> 1:28:51.800
or they just move the RV.

1:28:53.528 --> 1:28:55.393
- Are you saying I don't have much time?

1:28:56.732 --> 1:28:58.190
- [Kenny] Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1:28:58.190 --> 1:29:00.210
Don't get all girly on me, okay?

1:29:00.210 --> 1:29:01.680
I'll find you, don't worry about it.

1:29:01.680 --> 1:29:04.469
But if you think he's gonna move the RV,

1:29:04.469 --> 1:29:07.273
you gotta let me know, okay, like ASAP.

1:29:08.987 --> 1:29:09.821
Do you hear me?

1:29:12.940 --> 1:29:13.889
- Yes, I heard you.

1:29:15.050 --> 1:29:18.889
- [Kenny] All right, Jesus,
okay let me do some checking.

1:29:18.889 --> 1:29:19.723
I'll hit you up at sunset

1:29:19.723 --> 1:29:21.523
so don't turn off the radio, okay?

1:29:21.523 --> 1:29:24.000
Just keep the faith,
it'll be okay, really.

1:29:24.000 --> 1:29:24.913
- Okay, Bullet.

1:30:03.139 --> 1:30:06.660
- Captain, I don't want you
to take this personally.

1:30:06.660 --> 1:30:08.500
This is not a personal attack.

1:30:08.500 --> 1:30:10.200
- Yes sir, I-
- But there seems to be

1:30:10.200 --> 1:30:12.840
a pattern developing among the patients

1:30:12.840 --> 1:30:14.460
that you're treating.

1:30:14.460 --> 1:30:15.293
- Sir, I believe that-

1:30:15.293 --> 1:30:16.243
- Let me finish.

1:30:19.610 --> 1:30:21.240
Now I fully acknowledge that

1:30:21.240 --> 1:30:23.740
since we began the war in Afghanistan,

1:30:23.740 --> 1:30:26.090
the number of suicides
among returning veterans

1:30:26.090 --> 1:30:27.433
has greatly increased.

1:30:28.920 --> 1:30:33.920
But Captain, the majority of the soldiers

1:30:34.010 --> 1:30:35.433
that you were treating,

1:30:38.059 --> 1:30:38.893
let me be blunt.

1:30:41.059 --> 1:30:44.400
You are one of the few counselors we have

1:30:44.400 --> 1:30:47.000
that has a higher percentage

1:30:47.000 --> 1:30:49.500
of suicides among the men they're treating

1:30:49.500 --> 1:30:50.830
than non-suicides.

1:30:50.830 --> 1:30:53.050
- Colonel, sir, respectfully,

1:30:53.050 --> 1:30:55.583
you cannot be saying that
I'm not being successful.

1:30:58.710 --> 1:31:01.190
I'm prepared to go through each
and every one of my patients

1:31:01.190 --> 1:31:03.280
and provide a thorough
detailed explanation

1:31:03.280 --> 1:31:04.980
for their psychological issues!

1:31:04.980 --> 1:31:06.927
All of which might I add,
were pre-existing conditions.

1:31:06.927 --> 1:31:07.760
- I don't think that-

1:31:07.760 --> 1:31:09.030
- And in references to percentages,

1:31:09.030 --> 1:31:10.219
you might want to consider that

1:31:10.219 --> 1:31:11.900
as opposed to other counselors,

1:31:11.900 --> 1:31:14.340
my caseload is predominantly
composed of operators

1:31:14.340 --> 1:31:16.130
in the Special Forces Unit.

1:31:16.130 --> 1:31:18.240
And being a member of
the Special Forces Unit

1:31:18.240 --> 1:31:21.032
I might suggest already
indicate psychological issues.

1:31:22.272 --> 1:31:25.530
- If one more of your
patients commits suicide,

1:31:25.530 --> 1:31:26.710
I think it will be time for you

1:31:26.710 --> 1:31:28.530
to start considering other options.

1:31:31.564 --> 1:31:32.523
- Other options, sir?

1:31:32.523 --> 1:31:33.973
What other options?

1:31:35.960 --> 1:31:37.440
- You're young and you're talented.

1:31:37.440 --> 1:31:39.110
Get out of the military.

1:31:39.110 --> 1:31:41.570
Start a private practice, make some money.

1:31:41.570 --> 1:31:44.059
But I can't keep trying to explain

1:31:44.059 --> 1:31:47.430
how 90% of the soldiers
that you're treating

1:31:47.430 --> 1:31:49.780
ends up committing suicide,

1:31:49.780 --> 1:31:50.980
or hurting other people.

1:31:52.500 --> 1:31:53.700
We're here to help them,

1:31:54.639 --> 1:31:56.344
not push them over the edge.

1:31:56.344 --> 1:31:58.512
- [Man] Is that you, Tara?

1:31:59.727 --> 1:32:01.477
- Kenny, is that you?

1:32:03.807 --> 1:32:04.865
- No.

1:32:04.865 --> 1:32:06.865
My handle's Pill Popper.

1:32:08.480 --> 1:32:09.313
- What?

1:32:10.490 --> 1:32:12.750
- [Pill Popper] Bullet asked
me to make some research

1:32:12.750 --> 1:32:15.253
and I think I've narrowed
down your location.

1:32:16.730 --> 1:32:18.730
- You know where I am?

1:32:18.730 --> 1:32:20.070
- [Pill Popper] Yeah, but let me make sure

1:32:20.070 --> 1:32:21.957
that Bullet told me right.

1:32:21.957 --> 1:32:24.340
You can smell Amaranth on all four sides.

1:32:24.340 --> 1:32:25.540
You're in a flight path,

1:32:25.540 --> 1:32:28.210
and you can hear birds in tall trees.

1:32:28.210 --> 1:32:29.577
Is that all right?

1:32:29.577 --> 1:32:32.680
- Yes, yes, that's right, that's right.

1:32:32.680 --> 1:32:34.862
- [Pill Popper] This
actually makes more sense.

1:32:36.639 --> 1:32:38.660
- It makes sense?

1:32:38.660 --> 1:32:40.900
- [Pill Popper] There's an
abandoned landscaping company

1:32:40.900 --> 1:32:43.270
called Chamber's Cherubs.

1:32:43.270 --> 1:32:46.250
They were one of the main
suppliers of Amaranth

1:32:46.250 --> 1:32:47.500
until they went bankrupt.

1:32:48.530 --> 1:32:50.400
They haven't been able
to sell the property

1:32:50.400 --> 1:32:53.003
because it's located on a new flight path.

1:32:54.023 --> 1:32:55.666
- So you know where I am?

1:32:55.666 --> 1:32:57.790
- [Pill Popper] I'm
looking at the aerial photo

1:32:57.790 --> 1:33:00.070
and there's a wide open field

1:33:00.070 --> 1:33:01.403
bordered by tall trees.

1:33:02.330 --> 1:33:05.710
Looks like an old RV parked in the middle.

1:33:06.587 --> 1:33:09.112
- That's me, that's me, that's me.

1:33:09.112 --> 1:33:10.009
Call the cops please.

1:33:10.009 --> 1:33:12.509
Please call the cops right now!

1:33:12.509 --> 1:33:16.925
- [Pill Popper] Darling,
I'd love to call the police.

1:33:19.286 --> 1:33:21.934
(thudding)
See?

1:33:21.934 --> 1:33:23.936
- Conspiracy nut jobs.

1:33:23.936 --> 1:33:26.782
- [Pill Popper] I'm dead.

1:33:26.782 --> 1:33:28.478
- He's not gonna call the police,

1:33:28.478 --> 1:33:30.183
he's not gonna call the police.

1:33:30.183 --> 1:33:33.750
He fucking knows where I am,
he won't call the police!

1:33:33.750 --> 1:33:37.250
(sobbing) Fucking idiots.

1:33:38.707 --> 1:33:41.260
Sorry, sorry, can you say that again?

1:33:41.260 --> 1:33:42.750
I'm sorry, I didn't hear that last part.

1:33:42.750 --> 1:33:44.519
Can you say again?

1:33:44.519 --> 1:33:46.300
- [Pill Popper] Dead, I'm dead.

1:33:54.620 --> 1:33:58.059
Not even an innocent, unborn
baby wanted to come out of you.

1:33:58.059 --> 1:33:59.773
Your baby killed herself.

1:34:01.037 --> 1:34:03.704
(ominous music)

1:34:11.271 --> 1:34:12.188
- The fuck?

1:34:14.330 --> 1:34:16.489
- [Pill Popper] Everyone
you know, you've killed.

1:34:16.489 --> 1:34:18.260
- You killed me.

1:34:18.260 --> 1:34:19.447
You killed me.

1:34:20.959 --> 1:34:23.291
(screaming)

1:34:24.846 --> 1:34:27.449
- [Pill Popper] You
pushed them over the edge

1:34:27.449 --> 1:34:29.449
playing your mind games.

1:34:30.858 --> 1:34:33.358
(tense music)

1:34:49.809 --> 1:34:50.936
Do it!

1:34:50.936 --> 1:34:52.257
End the pain!

1:34:52.257 --> 1:34:54.023
You'll be saving lives.

1:34:58.791 --> 1:35:02.041
(lightly somber music)

1:36:12.582 --> 1:36:14.249
- What do you think?

1:36:15.304 --> 1:36:18.200
- I think we just about
got our drug perfected,

1:36:18.200 --> 1:36:19.273
that's what I think.

1:36:20.840 --> 1:36:23.360
They keeping that same fucking name?

1:36:23.360 --> 1:36:24.804
- Yeah.

1:36:24.804 --> 1:36:25.637
- Well.

1:36:30.740 --> 1:36:32.389
- People see what they wanna see.

1:36:33.370 --> 1:36:34.950
And then they create reality based

1:36:34.950 --> 1:36:36.503
on what they believe they see.

1:36:39.760 --> 1:36:41.660
- Well I gotta tell you.

1:36:41.660 --> 1:36:44.660
I really thought you blew your
fucking brains out out there.

1:36:48.309 --> 1:36:50.227
- Is this drug working?

1:36:51.719 --> 1:36:54.023
- Yes, the drug is infallible.

1:36:55.580 --> 1:36:57.630
- I can't believe that she thought

1:36:57.630 --> 1:36:59.710
you were gonna actually marry her.

1:36:59.710 --> 1:37:01.423
That's unbelievable to me.

1:37:02.809 --> 1:37:05.630
- Well, some people are too blind

1:37:05.630 --> 1:37:07.073
to see the true reality.

1:37:08.920 --> 1:37:10.233
She was never in an RV.

1:37:11.380 --> 1:37:12.833
Only chained in her mind.

1:37:18.710 --> 1:37:21.510
The drug blurs the lines between reality

1:37:21.510 --> 1:37:22.760
and the perception of it,

1:37:23.800 --> 1:37:26.362
allowing people to
inhabit false realities.

1:37:28.360 --> 1:37:29.630
I'm surprised it worked so well

1:37:29.630 --> 1:37:31.650
on a trained psychologist.

1:37:31.650 --> 1:37:33.290
Someone who is supposed to see

1:37:33.290 --> 1:37:34.833
through the lies of deception.

1:37:38.005 --> 1:37:41.005
(tense eerie music)

1:37:50.263 --> 1:37:51.096
- Bruce!

1:37:52.219 --> 1:37:53.563
De opresso de libre!

1:37:57.017 --> 1:37:58.313
To free the opressed.

1:38:02.299 --> 1:38:05.716
You know, the mind makes its own reality.

1:38:07.820 --> 1:38:09.740
Makes its own terror, yeah.

1:38:14.817 --> 1:38:16.900
Plays almost like a game.

1:38:21.639 --> 1:38:22.807
- A mind game.

1:38:31.501 --> 1:38:34.001
(eerie music)
