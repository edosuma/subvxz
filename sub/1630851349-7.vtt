Somebody else

00:29.905 --> 00:32.199

00:32.199 --> 00:33.825

But we gonna have to move
outside to my office.

03:30.585 --> 03:31.920
‐ Hold on a second.

03:34.589 --> 03:36.383

figure something out here.

03:36.383 --> 03:38.176
Oh.

You got supply.

03:56.027 --> 03:57.904
It's all about creating demand.

03:57.904 --> 04:00.198
Ain't no difference
than what's on the streets.

04:00.198 --> 04:01.575
You know this.

04:01.575 --> 04:03.410

we can use that wisdom too,

04:06.163 --> 04:08.790

07:40.669 --> 07:42.295
This is called
the Gavin Report.

07:42.295 --> 07:44.172
It tracks radio charts.

07:44.172 --> 07:46.549
Right here are all
the phone numbers

07:46.549 --> 07:48.593
for all the rap radio stations
from here in the tri‐state

07:48.593 --> 07:49.844
all across the country.

07:49.844 --> 07:54.265
I need you to dial
every single one, okay?

07:54.265 --> 07:55.725
‐ Hey, you gon' stay

07:55.725 --> 07:57.477
The phone calls and shit?

07:57.477 --> 08:00.355

I gotta go to college, man.

08:00.355 --> 08:02.607
‐ Hey, yo, what you

08:02.607 --> 08:05.318
‐ Yeah, man, for my education.

08:05.318 --> 08:07.570
‐ Hey, yo, Meth knows
some shorty at a university

08:07.570 --> 08:08.822

08:08.822 --> 08:10.407
They're gonna hit up
the college radio,

08:10.407 --> 08:11.866

08:11.866 --> 08:13.743
‐ Come on, 'Vine.
This is some bullshit, son.

08:13.743 --> 08:15.120
I hear you, D,

08:15.120 --> 08:17.122
and the next step
is for us to get these records

08:17.122 --> 08:19.708
into as many people's hands
as possible.

08:19.708 --> 08:23.294
So Gary, he's using
the gods in Virginia, right?

08:23.294 --> 08:25.797

You get to pick up this phone

and you get to call
major national radio stations

08:36.808 --> 08:39.769
and get them to play our record
so we can sell our record.

08:39.769 --> 08:41.354
It's all the same goal.

08:41.354 --> 08:42.981
The Avengers are assembling,

08:42.981 --> 08:44.816
and everyone's got
a role to play, okay?

08:44.816 --> 08:46.317

I just hope they got
some sort of yellow pages

09:36.326 --> 09:37.911

09:37.911 --> 09:39.954
‐ We'll just hit up
the student directory.

09:39.954 --> 09:41.831
Y'all niggas ain't never been

09:41.831 --> 09:43.792

10:06.397 --> 10:07.690

10:15.615 --> 10:17.200
‐ Yeah, well,

10:17.200 --> 10:18.868
I already stopped
selling weight

10:18.868 --> 10:21.287

those motherfucking contracts.

10:22.288 --> 10:24.499
‐ I'ma do what I gotta do,

10:24.499 --> 10:26.626
I'm down and committed

but that music shit

10:28.711 --> 10:31.339

Shit, at least not yet.

10:51.067 --> 10:52.318
‐ Yeah, yeah.

10:52.318 --> 10:53.611
Hey, yo,

11:12.297 --> 11:14.424
‐ We hit a few,

11:14.424 --> 11:17.719
Tower wasn't fucking
with our shit.

11:17.719 --> 11:21.306
Said they only fuck
with official distributors.

11:21.306 --> 11:23.683
So hopefully, Bobby and Divine

11:25.476 --> 11:28.354

‐ Yeah, yeah.
I got‐‐I got‐‐I got this record

11:33.526 --> 11:36.029

- Uh‐huh.

11:37.155 --> 11:39.032
"Protect Ya Neck"
by the Wu‐Tang Clan.

11:39.032 --> 11:40.658
We a‐‐we a crew of rappers,

11:40.658 --> 11:41.826
Yeah, yeah, what label you at?

11:48.541 --> 11:50.084
No, no, sorry,

11:54.088 --> 11:55.882
‐ This shit is a waste
of fucking time, son.

11:55.882 --> 11:58.134
I was trying to tell
Divine that, son.

11:58.134 --> 12:00.553
Can't be making
these fuckin' phone calls.

12:01.429 --> 12:02.722
‐ Word.

12:07.894 --> 12:11.231
You know, when niggas ain't
fucking with our shit,

12:11.231 --> 12:13.775
we gotta create a demand,
know what I mean?

12:13.775 --> 12:16.152
Like we did
at the record store.

12:17.946 --> 12:19.697

12:35.380 --> 12:36.506
Hey, what up? What up?

12:40.134 --> 12:41.761
I wanna hear

12:41.761 --> 12:42.845
Wu‐Tang?

12:42.845 --> 12:44.389
‐ Yeah, "Protect Ya Neck,"
nigga.

12:44.389 --> 12:45.598
"Protect Ya Neck"?

12:45.598 --> 12:47.141
‐ What, y'all ain't got
that shit?

12:47.141 --> 12:48.935
Nah, don't know it.
Nah, haven't heard it yet.

12:48.935 --> 12:50.520
‐ Well, y'all better work
on it, son.

12:50.520 --> 12:52.522
It's the only thing
niggas is playing right now.

12:52.522 --> 12:54.274
A'ight, word.
‐ Yeah.

12:54.274 --> 12:55.483
It's a new joint?

12:55.483 --> 12:57.652
Yeah, "Protect Ya Neck"
by Wu‐Tang Clan.

12:57.652 --> 12:59.112
A'ight, it's called
"Protect Ya Neck"?

12:59.112 --> 13:00.238
‐ Peace.
A'ight, bet, bet.

13:00.238 --> 13:02.156
‐ Yeah, get on that shit.
A'ight.

13:04.617 --> 13:06.286
‐ We switch it up,
know what I mean?

13:06.286 --> 13:08.496
‐ Ah, yes, man.
‐ You do a few. I do a few.

13:08.496 --> 13:10.248
‐ Mm‐hmm.

13:10.248 --> 13:12.792
Hey, yo, he just shot shorty
in the face?

13:12.792 --> 13:14.961
‐ Naw, the blast,
it blinded her.

13:14.961 --> 13:16.337
You ain't seen The Killer
before?

13:16.337 --> 13:19.257
‐ No.

13:19.257 --> 13:20.300
‐ You lyin'!

13:20.300 --> 13:21.968
Son, this my shit right here.

13:21.968 --> 13:23.094
I'm putting you on.

13:29.142 --> 13:31.144
My son ain't seen The Killer.

13:36.190 --> 13:39.193
‐ Okay, look, we‐‐we need
to find a distributor.

13:39.193 --> 13:42.697
Get into more than just
the local mom‐and‐pops.

13:42.697 --> 13:46.367
It would help if we had a label
behind us, though, you know?

13:46.367 --> 13:49.120
‐ No, we don't need...

13:49.120 --> 13:51.581
no label to dictate
our shit yet.

13:51.581 --> 13:52.790
Being independent
just means

13:52.790 --> 13:54.751
that we need to hustle
harder and smarter

13:54.751 --> 13:57.128
and figure this shit out
as we go, right?

13:57.128 --> 13:59.255
Whoo!

13:59.255 --> 14:00.757
Shit is no joke, huh?

14:00.757 --> 14:02.467
Maybe we should,
uh, split up?

14:02.467 --> 14:03.676
Yeah, well, we have to

14:03.676 --> 14:05.428
if we wanna cover
all this ground.

14:05.428 --> 14:07.055
Okay, let's do this,
but remember,

14:07.055 --> 14:08.222
you gotta be a salesman.

14:08.222 --> 14:10.224
It's more than
just the music, right?

14:10.224 --> 14:12.477
‐ You got this.
‐ Yeah.

14:12.477 --> 14:13.936
Yeah, we got this, yeah?

14:13.936 --> 14:15.563
‐ Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, let's do it.

14:15.563 --> 14:17.523
‐ All right, let's do it.
‐ All right.

14:51.557 --> 14:56.145
‐ Hey, yo, I got some shit.
It'll blow your fucking mind.

14:56.145 --> 14:57.772
It's the hottest out
in the streets right now,

14:57.772 --> 15:01.275
and, uh, you gotta check it.

15:01.275 --> 15:04.487
‐ Wu‐Tang Clan.
This is you?

15:04.487 --> 15:08.783
‐ Yeah.
I mean, I produced it.

15:08.783 --> 15:10.034
I'm the RZA.

15:10.034 --> 15:11.119
‐ All right, what label?

15:11.119 --> 15:12.620
‐ We're independent.

15:12.620 --> 15:14.038
‐ So you're a new artist.

15:14.038 --> 15:15.790
‐ Yeah.

15:15.790 --> 15:18.584
Yeah, look, everybody on there
is a new artist.

15:18.584 --> 15:20.002
‐ Look, I'm sorry, man.

15:20.002 --> 15:21.879
We're‐‐we're just not
breaking new artists right now.

15:21.879 --> 15:23.714
It's a tougher sell.

15:23.714 --> 15:25.174
‐ If you just listen to it‐‐

15:25.174 --> 15:26.509
‐ Rakeem?

15:26.509 --> 15:28.177
Get on the radio first.

15:29.762 --> 15:31.430
‐ Yo, DJ G.
I had you on my show

15:31.430 --> 15:33.141
when you were touring
with Naughty.

15:33.141 --> 15:35.768
‐ Oh, shit, yo!

15:35.768 --> 15:37.603
Yeah, yeah.

15:37.603 --> 15:39.605
Hey, thanks for all the love.

15:39.605 --> 15:41.607
‐ Mm‐hmm.
What are you doing here?

15:41.607 --> 15:45.278
‐ Yo, uh, I went independent
with my crew, the Wu‐Tang Clan.

15:45.278 --> 15:47.738
Shit's fucking grimy and dirty.

15:47.738 --> 15:49.657
‐ Yo, you ain't gotta sell me.

15:49.657 --> 15:51.742
You say it's dope, I trust you.

15:51.742 --> 15:54.871
Give me your record.
I'll play it on my show.

15:54.871 --> 15:55.955
‐ Yeah?

15:55.955 --> 15:57.373
‐ Yeah.

15:57.373 --> 15:59.792
Yo, I always thought you
and your cousin were dope MCs.

15:59.792 --> 16:01.711
‐ Hey, respect, man.
‐ Yeah, sure, man.

16:06.299 --> 16:08.301
‐ If only I could get
one of these damn distributors

16:08.301 --> 16:10.178
to push my shit out, man.

16:10.178 --> 16:12.847
‐ You know, certain
chain stores'll buy direct.

16:12.847 --> 16:16.267
Try Sam Goody, the Wherehouse.
They got booths here.

16:16.267 --> 16:20.396
Just make sure you talk to
someone that knows about rap.

16:20.396 --> 16:22.523
You'll know when you see 'em.

16:22.523 --> 16:24.817
‐ Sure.

16:24.817 --> 16:26.569
All right, man.
‐ For sure.

16:26.569 --> 16:27.987
‐ Oh. Appreciate that.

16:27.987 --> 16:29.572
‐ Mm‐hmm.
It was good seeing you.

16:29.572 --> 16:31.866
‐ You too, man.

16:31.866 --> 16:33.284
He looks determined

16:33.284 --> 16:34.911
without being ruthless.

16:34.911 --> 16:36.913
Something heroic
in his manner.

16:36.913 --> 16:38.289
There's a courage about him.

16:38.289 --> 16:39.832
Doesn't look like a killer.

16:39.832 --> 16:41.417
Comes across so calm.

16:43.085 --> 16:45.963
Acts like he has a dream,

16:45.963 --> 16:47.798
full of passion.

16:47.798 --> 16:50.635
‐ He about blinded
the singer who worked there.

16:50.635 --> 16:53.596
‐ He‐‐he getting
a cornea transplant

16:53.596 --> 16:55.264
and he feel guilty
for blinding her.

16:58.267 --> 17:00.186
‐ It only takes one bullet.

17:00.186 --> 17:01.771
‐ Damn.

17:01.771 --> 17:03.231
‐ That shit deep, son.

17:03.231 --> 17:04.732
This guy's
no ordinary assassin.

17:04.732 --> 17:06.609
‐ Word, man.

17:06.609 --> 17:08.236
I hope we're only
looking for one man.

17:08.236 --> 17:10.738
Mm.

17:10.738 --> 17:12.990
Oh, shit.

17:12.990 --> 17:16.035
Oh, shit, I forgot Shurrie
was coming in a hour, son.

17:16.035 --> 17:18.955
I gotta go get
these diapers real quick.

17:18.955 --> 17:22.541
‐ Well, you know, get me
some pizza on your way back.

17:22.541 --> 17:23.876
Just a slice or some shit.

17:23.876 --> 17:26.045
‐ Hey, yo, didn't you
just eat, my nigga?

17:26.045 --> 17:27.338
Damn, son.

17:27.338 --> 17:28.839
Nah, the pizzeria
ain't even on the way, B.

17:28.839 --> 17:30.466
‐ Yo, come on, man,
you could get me

17:30.466 --> 17:33.135
some‐‐some‐‐some Cheetos
or a honey bun or some shit.

17:33.135 --> 17:34.679
‐ I look like Benson
to you, my nigga?

17:34.679 --> 17:37.056
If you want a bag of Cheetos
or a honey bun,

17:37.056 --> 17:38.099
you better get your ass up.

17:38.099 --> 17:39.642
‐ Nigga want some company.

17:39.642 --> 17:41.602
Ah, shut up.
‐ Shit, man.

17:53.823 --> 17:55.741
‐ Yo, where Dirty at?

17:58.411 --> 18:00.162

what we gotta do first.

18:00.162 --> 18:01.622
Find that nigga later, man.

18:04.083 --> 18:05.543
‐ Unless y'all

18:05.543 --> 18:06.627
you're not getting in.

18:06.627 --> 18:08.921
You boys need to leave.

18:08.921 --> 18:10.131
Hey, yo, who you calling boys?

18:10.131 --> 18:12.008

We ain't here for that. Yeah.

18:16.053 --> 18:18.014
Yo, Angie will vouch
for us, man.

18:28.524 --> 18:30.651
They need to play this,
like, tonight.

18:30.651 --> 18:33.154
Do that?

18:33.154 --> 18:35.114

Yo, yo, yo.
Chill, chill, chill, chill.

18:36.824 --> 18:38.701

Yo, Deck, come on, son.

19:17.657 --> 19:20.493
‐ Yo, son, where do you get
them Clarks from?

19:20.493 --> 19:23.746
I ain't never seen 'em
in the dual colors like that.

19:23.746 --> 19:25.915
‐ You ain't know‐‐you
don't know nothing about these.

19:25.915 --> 19:28.250

I made 'em myself, B.

19:28.250 --> 19:29.794
‐ What you mean

19:29.794 --> 19:31.379
‐ I got

you want, then boom,

19:41.806 --> 19:42.848

for so long, then?

20:09.291 --> 20:12.086

20:20.594 --> 20:23.639
Tryin' to be all undercover

Come on, nigga, let's go.

22:59.169 --> 23:02.756
‐ You know,
just visiting an ex.

23:02.756 --> 23:05.175
What about you? You...

23:08.596 --> 23:10.014
Is he yours?

23:10.014 --> 23:13.934
Yeah. His name's Infinite.

23:13.934 --> 23:16.061
‐ Oh, child.

23:17.229 --> 23:19.607
‐ I'm not a child.

23:19.607 --> 23:21.066
‐ I guess you're not.

23:21.066 --> 23:23.736
You always were concerned
with taking care of others.

23:23.736 --> 23:26.530
‐ Well, we all can't be
selfish and just run off.

23:26.530 --> 23:29.575
You never even called Mom.

23:29.575 --> 23:32.745
‐ If I had thought that was
gon' come back on y'all, I‐‐

23:32.745 --> 23:37.124
I'm sorry for what I did.

23:37.124 --> 23:38.334
Truly.

23:39.668 --> 23:41.253
‐ Right. Well, I gotta go.

23:41.253 --> 23:43.213
I'll tell my mother
you said hello.

23:47.343 --> 23:50.012
‐ It's the hottest shit
coming out of New York City.

23:50.012 --> 23:52.139
Wu‐Tang is for everybody.

23:52.139 --> 23:54.224
This music gon'
get you high, son.

23:54.224 --> 23:56.602
‐ I heard you're selling
"tapes."

23:56.602 --> 23:58.270
‐ Yeah.

23:58.270 --> 23:59.396
You got $10?

24:04.401 --> 24:05.694
Gon' love it, son.

24:05.694 --> 24:06.987
Make sure you tell
your friends about it.

24:06.987 --> 24:08.656
Tell they friends about it too.

24:08.656 --> 24:11.075
‐ Hey, yo, son.
Where the fuck you go?

24:11.075 --> 24:13.661
‐ I was hollerin' at this
fine chocolate deluxe shorty.

24:13.661 --> 24:15.412
‐ When I turned around...
Fuck outta here, son.

24:15.412 --> 24:17.373
‐ Y'all was gone, so I figured

24:17.373 --> 24:19.416
might as well sell some product
while I wait.

24:19.416 --> 24:21.293
What's up with the radio?

24:21.293 --> 24:22.878
‐ Shit struck out, son.

24:22.878 --> 24:25.631
Don't even ask me
about that shit.

24:25.631 --> 24:27.174
‐ Yo, you giving away
our weed?

24:27.174 --> 24:28.884
‐ Selling away, son.

24:28.884 --> 24:32.304
Relax. Plenty left.
Just gotta entice 'em.

24:32.304 --> 24:34.848
Like a prize in the cereal box,
you know what I'm saying?

24:34.848 --> 24:38.435
These college kids
love Wu‐Tang, baby.

24:38.435 --> 24:40.354
Pow! Check it out.

24:40.354 --> 24:41.981
What's that?
‐ Fuck is this, man?

24:43.399 --> 24:45.567
Let me see this shit.

24:45.567 --> 24:47.403
Yo.

24:49.238 --> 24:50.864
Yo, I'm telling you,

24:50.864 --> 24:53.117
these guys know
how to get a party started.

24:53.117 --> 24:55.661
Okay, look,
I know you're a New Yorker.

24:55.661 --> 24:59.331
So am I, but the West
is dominating right now.

24:59.331 --> 25:01.750
Earl, trust me,
you're gonna be running back

25:01.750 --> 25:04.086
to buy more records
before you know it.

25:04.086 --> 25:05.254
‐ A'ight.

25:05.254 --> 25:06.505
‐ A'ight?
‐ A'ight.

25:06.505 --> 25:08.340
‐ A'ight.
Come on.

25:12.511 --> 25:14.430
‐ Earl, right?
‐ Yeah.

25:14.430 --> 25:16.682
‐ Divine Diggs,
Wu‐Tang Productions.

25:16.682 --> 25:18.308
Look, I‐I know
the West is poppin'.

25:18.308 --> 25:19.727
There's no doubt.

25:19.727 --> 25:22.563
But if you're looking
for that raw New York shit,

25:22.563 --> 25:23.897
I got something for you.

25:23.897 --> 25:25.441
‐ Word?
‐ Mm‐hmm.

25:39.079 --> 25:41.457
‐ Oh, yo, this what
I'm talking about.

25:41.457 --> 25:43.417
New York
needs this shit right now.

25:43.417 --> 25:44.626
This shit'll definitely sell.

25:44.626 --> 25:47.296
‐ Yo, I'm saying,
so‐‐so let's talk numbers.

25:47.296 --> 25:49.757
‐ I can move about
1,000 each for you.

25:49.757 --> 25:51.717
‐ 1,000?
‐ Uh‐huh.

25:51.717 --> 25:53.969
‐ Okay, you got a card?
‐ Yeah.

25:57.931 --> 25:59.725
‐ Bet.

25:59.725 --> 26:02.102
All right, so the tapes
are wholesale for $2.99.

26:02.102 --> 26:03.812
Then the vinyl is $1.99.

26:03.812 --> 26:05.355
I can get you an invoice,
and then you can

26:05.355 --> 26:07.066
make the check out
to Wu‐Tang Productions.

26:07.066 --> 26:09.109
It's right there on the card.
Or you know what?

26:09.109 --> 26:10.903
If you wanna give me cash
because that's easier‐‐

26:10.903 --> 26:13.822
‐ This your first time
working with a One‐Stop, huh?

26:13.822 --> 26:15.949
‐ Why?
‐ It's consignment, bro.

26:15.949 --> 26:17.576
We pay you
when we sell the records.

26:17.576 --> 26:19.286
‐ Yo, but that guy
just said something about you

26:19.286 --> 26:20.621
buying more records.

26:20.621 --> 26:21.830
‐ That guy is the owner
of a record label.

26:21.830 --> 26:23.791
Y'all with a label,
or y'all independent?

26:23.791 --> 26:27.211
‐ We, uh‐‐
we independent for now.

26:27.211 --> 26:29.505
‐ I'm sorry, bro.
I thought you knew.

26:29.505 --> 26:30.881
I can still flip
the records for you.

26:30.881 --> 26:32.299
You just gonna have to wait
to see the money.

26:34.760 --> 26:36.095
‐ Yeah, that's okay.

26:36.095 --> 26:38.472
I got your card, right?
I'll‐‐I'll hit you up.

26:38.472 --> 26:39.848
‐ A'ight.

26:39.848 --> 26:41.517
Yeah, keep that.

26:44.019 --> 26:47.648
‐ I just hate the way
that she was looking at me.

26:47.648 --> 26:49.775
Judging me like
I'm irresponsible.

26:49.775 --> 26:52.236
‐ She probably just
jealous of you, for real.

26:52.236 --> 26:54.279
‐ Why would she be
jealous of me?

26:54.279 --> 26:56.990
‐ 'Cause all she do is,
you know,

26:56.990 --> 26:59.326
burn everything down
around her.

26:59.326 --> 27:02.412
That's probably why her ass
be skippin' town every month.

27:05.207 --> 27:07.876
She don't know
how to build a real life.

27:08.919 --> 27:11.505
Not like the one you over here
building for us.

27:14.216 --> 27:17.177
Yo, who the fuck
are you talking to right now?

27:17.177 --> 27:19.138
‐ Yo, why is he here?

27:19.138 --> 27:23.058
‐ 'Vine want us calling up
the radio stations and shit,

27:23.058 --> 27:24.643
trying to build up the single.

27:24.643 --> 27:26.687
Get people checking for it,
know what I mean?

27:26.687 --> 27:29.439
‐ Mm. And he couldn't
do that at his house?

27:29.439 --> 27:30.899
‐ Yeah, it's long‐distance
calls and shit.

27:30.899 --> 27:34.778
He said his moms
is gone freak out, so...

27:36.697 --> 27:39.449
‐ My boys.

27:42.953 --> 27:44.454
So hold on, hold on,
hold on.

27:44.454 --> 27:46.790
You calling me
a liar right now?

27:46.790 --> 27:49.209
Hey, yo, shorty, you‐‐you ain't
gotta raise your voice.

27:49.209 --> 27:53.046
Yo, shut the fuck up
and listen sometimes, man!

27:53.046 --> 27:54.423
What's wrong with that bitch?

27:54.423 --> 27:56.258
‐ Hey, yo,
what station was that, B?

27:56.258 --> 27:58.719
‐ Fucking
"Stretch and Bobbito."

27:58.719 --> 28:01.138
Bitch wouldn't take
my fucking request.

28:01.138 --> 28:04.308
Excuse me‐‐woman wouldn't
take my fucking request, guy.

28:04.308 --> 28:07.561
‐ They got some ignorant people
answering the phone, son.

28:07.561 --> 28:09.563
‐ I know y'all not talking.

28:09.563 --> 28:11.982
You're too aggressive.

28:11.982 --> 28:13.442
Haven't you heard
you catch more flies

28:13.442 --> 28:14.902
with honey than vinegar?

28:14.902 --> 28:16.028
‐ What are you talking about?

28:16.028 --> 28:18.113
Nobody's‐‐who's catching flies?

28:18.113 --> 28:19.948
‐ Not you. Move.

28:23.702 --> 28:24.745
Thank you.

28:28.457 --> 28:30.792
Have you called
this one in Atlanta?

28:30.792 --> 28:32.169
‐ Nah.

28:38.926 --> 28:41.511
WGBO 102.1.

28:41.511 --> 28:42.763
‐ Hey there.

28:42.763 --> 28:44.181
Hi,
what can I do for you?

28:44.181 --> 28:46.308
‐ Yeah, I was wondering
if you could play that, um,

28:46.308 --> 28:48.894
"Protect Ya Neck"
by the Wu‐Tang Clan?

28:48.894 --> 28:50.395
Wu‐Tang what?

28:50.395 --> 28:52.689
‐ You haven't heard it yet?
I don't know them.

28:52.689 --> 28:55.150
‐ Girl, let me tell you.

28:58.779 --> 29:00.405
‐ Can I help you
with something?

29:21.635 --> 29:23.095
‐ It's all right.

29:23.095 --> 29:25.722
‐ You a buyer, yo.
You should‐‐you should know

29:25.722 --> 29:27.766
good hip‐hop when you hear it.

29:27.766 --> 29:31.311
‐ Honestly, I'm more of a
British synthpop kind of guy.

29:31.311 --> 29:33.105
Do you know New Order's album?

29:33.105 --> 29:35.273
‐ Yo, what the fuck?

29:35.273 --> 29:37.150
‐ All right, look,
I only pretended

29:37.150 --> 29:39.444
to be into rap and R&amp;B

29:39.444 --> 29:41.530
so I could get this job
as an urban buyer.

29:41.530 --> 29:42.823
I don't know what's good.

29:42.823 --> 29:44.574
I just buy
what the label sends me.

29:44.574 --> 29:46.868
And I blew my budget
already, man.

29:48.537 --> 29:49.788
I'm sorry.

30:02.592 --> 30:04.219
‐ Hell yeah, son.

30:04.219 --> 30:05.429
Y'all don't want this shit,
man.

30:05.429 --> 30:07.055
You know how they do it
right here.

30:07.055 --> 30:11.601
‐ Hey, yo, y'all letting some
first‐timers whup y'all ass.

30:11.601 --> 30:14.021
Come on, Larry Bird.

30:14.021 --> 30:17.065
‐ Whoo!

30:17.065 --> 30:18.775
Drink the fuck up.

30:18.775 --> 30:19.901
‐ Yo, I ain't drinking
this shit

30:19.901 --> 30:21.445
after that nasty‐ass ball
was in there.

30:21.445 --> 30:22.529
That's foul.

30:22.529 --> 30:23.697
‐ Hey, yo, hold on.

30:23.697 --> 30:26.283
Alcohol kills
the germs anyway, son.

30:26.283 --> 30:28.535
Hey, yo, beer is beer.
Word!

30:28.535 --> 30:31.496
Yo, cheers, yo, cheers, cheers!

30:31.496 --> 30:33.498
‐ Hey, everyone,
drink, drink,

30:33.498 --> 30:36.293
drink, drink, drink,
drink, drink, drink,

30:36.293 --> 30:37.878
drink, drink, drink.

30:41.465 --> 30:43.258
‐ Why Ol' Dirty Bastard?

30:43.258 --> 30:46.428
‐ 'Cause ain't no father
to my style,

30:46.428 --> 30:48.096
but I can be the father
to your child,

30:48.096 --> 30:49.431
you know what I'm saying?

30:58.190 --> 30:59.941
‐ You ever smoked
a woolie before?

31:12.204 --> 31:14.289
Oh!

31:16.416 --> 31:18.418
How's it gonna be
a party without no music?

31:18.418 --> 31:20.337
‐ Come on, let's bounce.

31:20.337 --> 31:22.589
‐ Yo, man, what the fuck?
Hey, yo.

31:22.589 --> 31:24.174
Hey, yo, I got this,
though, son. Hold on.

31:24.174 --> 31:26.259
Come on, kick a song
like this, bro.

32:38.248 --> 32:39.791
Oh!
‐ Kick that rhythm.

32:39.791 --> 32:41.459
He's kickin' that rhythm.

33:12.532 --> 33:16.161
‐ Damn, that shit is dope.

33:16.161 --> 33:17.787
‐ Yo, check it out,
check it out.

33:17.787 --> 33:20.373
If y'all like that,
you gon' love this.

33:20.373 --> 33:22.667
Hey, yo, give him that Wu shit.

33:22.667 --> 33:24.419
Yo, play that shit, son.

33:24.419 --> 33:27.047
And turn that shit up, man.

33:27.047 --> 33:28.632
Come on, DJ, turn it up.

33:42.395 --> 33:43.939
Jeffery, is that you?

33:43.939 --> 33:45.273
Yes, Jennie.

33:46.691 --> 33:48.193
You know him?

33:48.193 --> 33:49.361
‐ Yeah.

33:49.361 --> 33:50.946
We're old buddies.

33:50.946 --> 33:52.948
We used to hang around
in the same neighborhood.

33:52.948 --> 33:55.200
‐ Yeah. I forget.

33:55.200 --> 33:57.077
‐ He was Mickey Mouse.
I'm Dumbo.

33:57.077 --> 33:58.954
‐ Come on, man.

33:58.954 --> 34:01.164
That's what they
come up with, son?

34:01.164 --> 34:02.666
It's good to see you
after all this time.

34:02.666 --> 34:04.417
‐ Hey, yo, wouldn't that shit
be crazy

34:04.417 --> 34:06.461
if they actually
became friends and shit?

34:06.461 --> 34:09.547
‐ They do.
You gotta keep watching,

34:09.547 --> 34:11.258
know what I mean?

34:11.258 --> 34:12.801
I'm here to sort it out now.

34:12.801 --> 34:15.262
Oh, shit, man.

34:24.688 --> 34:28.316
‐ It's getting late,
so we're gonna head out.

34:28.316 --> 34:29.693
‐ What's up?

34:29.693 --> 34:31.778
‐ I came over here to relax.

34:31.778 --> 34:34.656
Y'all managed to Tom Sawyer me
into doing your work.

34:34.656 --> 34:36.908
‐ Tom Sawyer?
What you talkin' 'bout?

34:36.908 --> 34:39.035
‐ Y'all both need
to pick up a book

34:39.035 --> 34:40.328
from time to time.

34:40.328 --> 34:42.539
‐ Nah, I'm good
with the flicks.

34:42.539 --> 34:44.374
‐ Come on,
you know I be reading

34:44.374 --> 34:45.625
mad comic books, baby.

34:45.625 --> 34:47.794
‐ Yeah, okay.
Can you hand me his stuff?

34:47.794 --> 34:49.838
‐ Yeah, I got you.

34:53.300 --> 34:56.094
Get home safe.
Thanks for your help.

35:03.310 --> 35:04.519
Looks like you had
about as much luck

35:04.519 --> 35:06.271
as I did, huh?

35:06.271 --> 35:09.774
‐ Damn, yo.
Not one distributor?

35:09.774 --> 35:14.237
‐ No, no, we found one,
but he works on consignment.

35:14.237 --> 35:15.447
This point,
it's probably worth it.

35:15.447 --> 35:17.157
It's better than nothing.
‐ It's something.

35:19.659 --> 35:22.787
Yo, hey, our shit is too dope.

35:22.787 --> 35:24.205
I don't know
what the fuck is going on.

35:24.205 --> 35:25.832
‐ You know, when I
was out there hustling,

35:25.832 --> 35:28.209
you once told me that my way
wasn't the only way.

35:28.209 --> 35:32.297
I didn't want to hear it then,
but you're right, Bobby.

35:32.297 --> 35:37.052
Yo, this music,
your music, it's the way.

35:37.052 --> 35:38.595
And I have your back now.

35:38.595 --> 35:41.514
It's not a‐‐it's not a sprint,
Bobby.

35:41.514 --> 35:46.019
It's a marathon.
We just have to keep grinding.

35:46.019 --> 35:49.522
‐ Hey, Violet, can I ride
with you to the Def Jam party?

35:51.691 --> 35:54.027
‐ Hey, yo. Yo.

35:54.027 --> 35:56.905
Y'all said something
about a‐‐a Def Jam party?

35:56.905 --> 35:58.531
‐ Oh, so now you wanna talk
to me.

35:58.531 --> 35:59.658
What, you think someone like me

35:59.658 --> 36:01.242
doesn't know anything
about rap music?

36:01.242 --> 36:02.994
‐ It's not even like that.

36:02.994 --> 36:04.746
‐ I'm just messing with you.

36:04.746 --> 36:06.122
Violet.

36:06.122 --> 36:09.250
‐ Yo, RZA.
This is my brother Divine.

36:09.250 --> 36:10.669
‐ Hey, hey,
‐ Hey.

36:10.669 --> 36:12.379
Just out here trying
to get our record out

36:12.379 --> 36:13.630
to a distributor.

36:13.630 --> 36:15.048
‐ Yeah?

36:17.759 --> 36:22.138
Wu‐Tang Clan, huh?
That's, uh, different.

36:22.138 --> 36:25.016
‐ If we could just play
the song for you or, like‐‐

36:25.016 --> 36:26.226
‐ Oh, no need.

36:26.226 --> 36:28.186
I heard it after you
walked right by me

36:28.186 --> 36:30.146
and played it at the booth
across from mine.

36:32.107 --> 36:33.692
I like it.

36:33.692 --> 36:35.860
You definitely
got something here.

36:35.860 --> 36:37.112
You on the radio?

36:37.112 --> 36:40.448
‐ Yeah, we‐‐you know,
we working on it.

36:40.448 --> 36:42.742
‐ Call me when you get
some spins, you know?

36:42.742 --> 36:44.619
Could be college radio,
wherever.

36:44.619 --> 36:46.079
Just give me
something to work with

36:46.079 --> 36:49.290
so I can show my bosses
and get you into our stores.

36:49.290 --> 36:53.503
‐ Thank you, uh...Violet Brown.

37:03.096 --> 37:07.225
Hey, I'm sorry 'Vine.
I wasn't‐‐

37:07.225 --> 37:08.810
‐ Yo, for what?

37:08.810 --> 37:11.146
We got a consignment deal
and a contact

37:11.146 --> 37:13.690
for one of the biggest
retail buyers in the country.

37:13.690 --> 37:15.233
Might not be
what we had hoped for,

37:15.233 --> 37:16.818
but it's more than we had
at the start of the day.

37:16.818 --> 37:18.862
Hopefully,
the rest of the clan

37:18.862 --> 37:21.114
is coming through
with that radio airplay.

37:21.114 --> 37:23.116
‐ I'm sure they will.
Come on.

37:28.913 --> 37:32.000
I want you to promise me

37:32.000 --> 37:34.544
if I don't make it tonight,
get me to the hospital.

37:35.754 --> 37:37.547
Get them to operate.

37:37.547 --> 37:39.132
My corneas are for Jennie.

37:39.132 --> 37:42.135
WKCR 89.9.
‐ Yes. Hello.

37:42.135 --> 37:43.762
Yo.

37:43.762 --> 37:45.847
‐ I wanna put in a request.
What's your request?

37:45.847 --> 37:49.392
Wu Tang Clan's

37:49.392 --> 37:51.811
Yo, this shit
is getting real tired.

37:51.811 --> 37:53.146
You need to stop calling
back up here.

37:53.146 --> 37:54.856
‐ Wait, hold on. What you mean?

37:54.856 --> 37:57.233
What you‐‐what you mean

37:57.233 --> 37:58.443
You know what you doing.

37:59.444 --> 38:00.528

38:00.528 --> 38:02.322
‐ Yo, watch your

38:02.322 --> 38:03.782
Yeah, whatever.

38:03.782 --> 38:05.116
Yo, hello?

38:11.873 --> 38:17.128

radio station, guy.

38:17.128 --> 38:19.088

38:21.508 --> 38:24.177
‐ Yeah, them niggas
is right there uptown, son.

38:25.929 --> 38:29.015
You could hop on the ferry
and be over there

38:29.015 --> 38:31.810
in less than a hour.

38:31.810 --> 38:34.479

38:39.818 --> 38:41.736
Yeah, come on, son.

39:00.547 --> 39:03.466
‐ Are you guests of the show?
‐ Yeah, unexpected guests.

39:03.466 --> 39:05.510
‐ You can't come in here.

39:08.555 --> 39:10.974
‐ A'ight, let's do this, Dumbo.

39:10.974 --> 39:14.561
‐ Yo, why I gotta be Dumbo,
Mickey Mouse?

39:17.981 --> 39:20.358
Yo, this area
is private.

41:18.977 --> 41:21.437
‐ Excuse me, can I help y'all
with something?

41:21.437 --> 41:23.398
‐ Hey, yo, we got
something for you.

41:35.410 --> 41:37.996
Yo, I love college, man.

41:37.996 --> 41:39.163
Where can I get
a application at?

41:40.415 --> 41:41.791
‐ You think it's just
parties and shit,

41:41.791 --> 41:43.543
but your ass wouldn't last
a week in college.

41:43.543 --> 41:46.337
Taking tests and shit?
Nah, son.

41:46.337 --> 41:48.548
‐ Yo, all you gotta do
is memorize shit,

41:48.548 --> 41:49.966
spit it back out.

41:49.966 --> 41:51.300
Not that much different
than rhyming in the studio.

41:51.300 --> 41:53.261
‐ Word.
‐ Nah, that's you, kid.

41:53.261 --> 41:55.805
‐ Too many white people
for me, son.

41:55.805 --> 41:57.807
‐ Yo, you know they got
Black colleges, right?

41:57.807 --> 42:00.727
‐ Then what?
Get a nine‐to‐five?

42:00.727 --> 42:03.312
That ain't me, son.

42:03.312 --> 42:05.773
‐ Yo, RZA got a five‐year plan

42:05.773 --> 42:08.401
that's better than
four years in college.

42:08.401 --> 42:09.652
‐ Yo, they keep rock orders

42:09.652 --> 42:11.696
like there was rock orders
last night,

42:11.696 --> 42:13.614
it ain't gon' take
five years, son.

42:13.614 --> 42:15.783
We on our way. Wu‐Tang, baby.

42:15.783 --> 42:17.660
- Word.
- Word.

42:24.083 --> 42:25.460
‐ If you were
at the Zeta Rho Phi party

42:25.460 --> 42:28.921
that got shut down last night,
I hope you made it back.

42:28.921 --> 42:30.298
Here's that new joint
by some dudes

42:30.298 --> 42:32.008
who tore it down last night.

42:32.008 --> 42:35.595

by Wu‐Tang Clan.

42:37.555 --> 42:39.432
‐ Yo, this shit
you gave me is dope.

42:39.432 --> 42:41.100
Where you say you got it?

42:41.100 --> 42:42.894
‐ Dudes just rushed
the station.

42:42.894 --> 42:44.854
Came up in here like,
"Play our record."

42:44.854 --> 42:46.689
‐ You should play it tonight.

42:46.689 --> 42:48.399
Hell yeah.
‐ Yeah.

42:58.034 --> 42:59.535
‐ You heard us on "Stretch
and Bob," know what I mean?

42:59.535 --> 43:01.245
We was doing
what we supposed to do,

43:01.245 --> 43:03.039
handling our business
and all of that.

43:03.039 --> 43:06.709
‐ Hey, yo, y'all.
I did, yo. I did.

43:06.709 --> 43:08.753
And I gave that shit
to a motherfucking DJ

43:08.753 --> 43:11.339
at the convention center,
and he played that shit too.

43:11.339 --> 43:13.591
And Meth and them got
that college to play it.

43:13.591 --> 43:15.760
It's a good start, but, uh,

43:15.760 --> 43:18.596
we need major play
at radio stations.

43:18.596 --> 43:20.098
‐ You dig?
‐ Word.

43:20.098 --> 43:23.810
You dig?
‐ We gon' get that.

43:23.810 --> 43:25.937
‐ All right.

43:32.360 --> 43:33.903
‐ Yo, cousin, cousin!
What's up, yo?

43:33.903 --> 43:36.364
‐ What's the word
with the gods, huh?

43:36.364 --> 43:38.199
‐ Street team down in VA
working.

43:38.199 --> 43:39.617
They love the new record.

43:39.617 --> 43:41.285
Yo, we might need
another pressing.

43:41.285 --> 43:43.162
We still gotta make
our money back, nigga.

43:43.162 --> 43:44.622
Come on, son,
consignment ain't it.

43:44.622 --> 43:47.041
‐ Once we head up 95
hitting up all the towns,

43:47.041 --> 43:48.709
getting our name out there,

43:48.709 --> 43:50.419
shit gonna be selling
like crack rocks, man.

43:50.419 --> 43:52.755
‐ That's what I'm sayin'.
‐ Word, word, word.

43:52.755 --> 43:54.632
‐ Son, so where we headed
first?

43:54.632 --> 43:58.511
Yo, I think, uh,
Connecticut, maybe Providence.

43:58.511 --> 44:00.221
Some shit like that.

44:00.221 --> 44:02.265
Divine planned
all this shit, so...

44:03.474 --> 44:05.184
Shit, it's gon' be funky
on that van.

44:05.184 --> 44:09.272
I went ahead and got that
special fix, know what I mean?

44:09.272 --> 44:10.773
That's the new shit,
nigga.

44:10.773 --> 44:12.024
‐ Yeah, what you know
about that?

44:12.024 --> 44:14.193
Right here
on WBLS 107.5,

44:14.193 --> 44:16.654
New York's home for
the hottest hip‐hop and R&amp;B.

44:16.654 --> 44:18.489
I got a brand‐new exclusive
for you.

44:18.489 --> 44:20.783
And this song is bubbling
in the streets right now.

44:20.783 --> 44:22.535
Coming at you
from Staten Island,

44:22.535 --> 44:25.371
here's Wu‐Tang Clan
with "Protect Ya Neck."

44:27.081 --> 44:28.082
‐ Oh, shit!

44:28.082 --> 44:29.667
Oh, shit! Oh!

44:29.667 --> 44:32.587
Hey yo, yo,

44:32.587 --> 44:34.088
Y'all hear that shit, nigga?

44:34.088 --> 44:36.090
‐ Yo, yo, come on!
Come on, come on, come on!

44:36.090 --> 44:37.842
What the fuck?

44:43.723 --> 44:46.058
‐ Yo, yo!
You hear that shit?

44:49.145 --> 44:50.646
‐ Hey.
‐ Where to, sir?

44:50.646 --> 44:52.857
‐ Uh, JFK, please.

44:52.857 --> 44:54.150
Ooh, can you turn that up?

44:57.653 --> 44:59.405
Hey, could you
pull over real quick?

44:59.405 --> 45:01.157
I can't believe
this is happening again.

45:01.157 --> 45:02.658
I know this guy.

45:04.994 --> 45:06.662
You know what?
Actually, never mind.

45:06.662 --> 45:09.040
I'm going to, uh‐‐
I'm gonna stay.

45:09.040 --> 45:11.334
‐ Are you sure?
‐ Yeah, I have to.

45:11.334 --> 45:13.085
By the way, you didn't catch
the name of the song,

45:13.085 --> 45:14.921
‐ did you?
‐ Nah.

45:16.631 --> 45:19.508
‐ Hey, yo. Hey, yo, yo.
This is big, son.

45:19.508 --> 45:21.135
We made it.
We made it.

45:40.947 --> 45:42.949
Yo, whatever that song was

45:42.949 --> 45:45.326
you just played
by whoever that was,

45:45.326 --> 45:48.496
y'all need to play that again,
right now,

45:48.496 --> 45:50.122
back‐to‐back on a loop.

45:52.083 --> 45:53.417
Hello?

45:53.417 --> 45:54.460
Hello?

45:54.460 --> 45:56.212
Am I on the air?

45:56.212 --> 45:57.838
Is this a answering machine?

45:57.838 --> 45:59.924
The hell kind of station
is this?

45:59.924 --> 46:01.217
I'd like to request

46:01.217 --> 46:03.427
"Protect Ya Neck"
by the Wu‐Tang Clan.

46:03.427 --> 46:05.137
If y'all don't know
what I'm talkin' about,

46:05.137 --> 46:07.056
y'all shouldn't even be
on this job.

46:07.056 --> 46:08.849
That means you out of touch
with the people.

46:08.849 --> 46:10.309
That means you got no ear
to the streets,

46:10.309 --> 46:11.686
you know what I'm saying?
That means‐‐

46:13.145 --> 46:15.606
Y'all finally played
some real shit.

46:15.606 --> 46:18.401
Y'all finally played some
real shit for the streets.

46:19.902 --> 46:23.614
Soooo!

46:25.199 --> 46:26.826
Can you please
tell your DJs

46:26.826 --> 46:29.620
to put that Wu‐Tang
in the rotation?

46:29.620 --> 46:32.498
I'm sittin' here by my radio
with a cassette,

46:32.498 --> 46:35.251
lookin' stupid,
'waitin' to record.

46:35.251 --> 46:37.128
Not that I'm broke or nothin'.

46:37.128 --> 46:39.088
But I need a copy of that,
feel me?

46:40.881 --> 46:42.550
- Yo, what's up, man?
- Coolin', man.

46:42.550 --> 46:44.510
Chillin', chillin'.
Yo, you know I had to call.

46:44.510 --> 46:46.345
You know why, right?
Why?

46:46.345 --> 46:49.348
Because, yo,
I never, ever call

46:49.348 --> 46:51.517
and ask you to play something,
right?

46:51.517 --> 46:52.852
Yeah.

46:52.852 --> 46:53.894
You know
what I wanna hear, right?

46:53.894 --> 46:55.229
What you wanna hear?

46:55.229 --> 46:56.564
I wanna hear
that Wu‐Tang joint.

46:56.564 --> 46:57.565
- Wu‐Tang again?
- Ah, yeah.

46:57.565 --> 46:58.899
Again and again.

47:00.401 --> 47:01.902
Get on the line.
