♪♪

00:04.171 --> 00:06.338
(rock music playing)

00:06.340 --> 00:08.941
You know why
it's a great day?

00:08.943 --> 00:11.310
For you?
Because it's a day.

00:11.312 --> 00:14.947
Endless possibilities
lie ahead.

00:14.949 --> 00:17.216
Nothing is endless
except your goofy face.

00:20.388 --> 00:22.955
What a great day!

00:22.957 --> 00:25.057
Looky here.
What should we buy?

00:25.059 --> 00:27.526
We're not buying anything.
That money is not yours.

00:27.528 --> 00:30.796
This is where
our friendship ends,
right here, right now.

00:30.798 --> 00:33.632
Goodbye forever.

00:33.634 --> 00:36.635
Maya, somebody dropped that.

00:36.637 --> 00:38.404
Who? Name?
Whose is it?

00:38.406 --> 00:41.240
Whose? I'll take any "whose."
I'll take the "who's"
with the apostrophe

00:41.242 --> 00:42.975
Because I never know
which is right.

00:42.977 --> 00:47.212
How could you live
knowing that that belongs
to somebody else?

00:47.214 --> 00:49.248
Everything I own
belonged to somebody else.

00:49.250 --> 00:51.216
Riley, it's a five-sky.
Not even a one-sky.

00:51.218 --> 00:53.252
Anybody could find a one-sky.

00:53.254 --> 00:54.586
Put it back.

00:54.588 --> 00:56.722
This is my only source
of income.

00:56.724 --> 00:59.425
(bell rings)

00:59.427 --> 01:01.393
Read what it says, maya.

01:01.395 --> 01:03.162
"in god we trust."

01:03.164 --> 01:05.831
Seriously, you're going
to go all the way there?

01:05.833 --> 01:08.167
Don't you believe that someone
is always watching

01:08.169 --> 01:10.235
To see
if you do the right thing?

01:13.441 --> 01:15.374
Not anymore.

01:15.376 --> 01:17.543
Maya, you know
what I'm talking about.

01:17.545 --> 01:19.378
And you know
what I'm talking about?

01:19.380 --> 01:21.713
Two mocha-chip
ice-cream cones.

01:21.715 --> 01:23.449
Mocha-chip, you say?

01:24.718 --> 01:27.252
With a mocha chip
in every bite.

01:27.254 --> 01:28.587
How do they do that?

01:28.589 --> 01:31.490
Riles, how about I do
what I do, and you do
what you do?

01:33.060 --> 01:36.128
That's ridiculous.

01:44.905 --> 01:47.206
Riley?
(gasps)

01:47.208 --> 01:49.541
Oh, no.

01:49.543 --> 01:51.376
What a great day!

01:51.378 --> 01:53.345

Riles, it was just a coincidence
I happened to find it.

02:56.477 --> 02:57.643
Can you leave it alone?

02:57.645 --> 02:59.645
There are no coincidences,
maya.

02:59.647 --> 03:03.215
A coincidence is just
the universe's way of saying,
"hi."

03:03.217 --> 03:05.050
Hi.

03:05.052 --> 03:09.087
Somebody here needs
to learn a lesson.

03:10.391 --> 03:13.792
In 1425, joan of arc,
a 13-year-old girl,

03:13.794 --> 03:16.528
Believed that she heard
the voice of god...

03:16.530 --> 03:19.464
(whispering)
this is your lesson.

03:19.466 --> 03:22.834
...Telling her to drive
the english out of France.

03:22.836 --> 03:24.469
-Wow.
-Amazing.

03:24.471 --> 03:27.139
Yeah, back then
you could drive at 13?

03:27.141 --> 03:29.708
Nobody hears voices
in their head.

03:29.710 --> 03:31.577
That's just crazy.

03:31.579 --> 03:33.545
It is so!

03:35.516 --> 03:37.883
Now joan knew
that this belief

03:37.885 --> 03:39.751
Could cost her
her life.

03:39.753 --> 03:41.587
What if she wasn't crazy,
farkle?

03:41.589 --> 03:43.589
What if she just deeply believed
in something?

03:43.591 --> 03:45.257
Well, why believe in anything
you can't prove?

03:45.259 --> 03:47.492
Ah, now there's a question.

03:47.494 --> 03:50.395
-Guess where
this is leading us.
-To an assignment.

03:50.397 --> 03:53.398
-(all groaning)
-yay.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.334
You've all walked
through life long enough

03:55.336 --> 03:56.902
With your blissfully
empty heads.

03:56.904 --> 03:58.537
But what do you guys
really believe in?

03:58.539 --> 04:02.708
Some of our greatest thinkers
believed in something
so strongly

04:02.710 --> 04:05.410
That they gave their lives
to change the world.

04:05.412 --> 04:08.780
Show-offs.

04:08.782 --> 04:11.883
Does anyone here
believe in anything,
anything at all?

04:11.885 --> 04:13.552
I believe that maya
did wrong

04:13.554 --> 04:15.787
By taking somebody else's
five-dollar bill.

04:15.789 --> 04:19.558
I believe
in five dollars' worth
of ice cream.

04:19.560 --> 04:22.060
And I believe that you two
are the perfect team for this

04:22.062 --> 04:23.595
If there ever was one.

04:23.597 --> 04:26.131
You guys are going to report
on thomas jefferson.

04:26.133 --> 04:28.600
Aw, boo!

04:28.602 --> 04:31.937
Farkle,
you're a man of science.

04:31.939 --> 04:34.039
I needs me my proof.

04:34.041 --> 04:37.542
-And lucas.
-I have beliefs
that work for me, sir.

04:37.544 --> 04:39.244
Well, this is going
to be fun.

04:39.246 --> 04:41.380
You guys are going to report
on joan of arc.

04:41.382 --> 04:44.349
-She's a saint.
-Yeah, a saint. Whoo-whoo!

04:46.553 --> 04:49.755
Now I want you two girls
to really learn something
from jefferson.

04:49.757 --> 04:51.757
Ah, boo!

04:51.759 --> 04:53.592
Why do you keep
booing jefferson?

04:53.594 --> 04:55.093
-He hates us.
-How do you know?

04:55.095 --> 04:58.563
-He's making us do this.
-He died over 200 years ago.

04:58.565 --> 05:00.966
-So it's you
making us do this.
-Yeah.

05:00.968 --> 05:03.568
Both:
Aw, boo!

05:03.570 --> 05:05.404
Thank you. Thank you.

05:10.311 --> 05:12.911
Auggie:
I'm doing my best,

05:15.149 --> 05:18.483
But some days
are hard.

05:18.485 --> 05:20.919
Like today
was a hard day.

05:20.921 --> 05:23.221
I'm doing my best.

05:25.592 --> 05:27.492
Do you fly around
up there?

05:27.494 --> 05:29.294
Is it crowded?

05:29.296 --> 05:33.699
Do you bump into anybody,
or is there room to go fast?

05:33.701 --> 05:36.635
Auggie, honey? Oh.

05:36.637 --> 05:39.705
Are you sleeping?

05:39.707 --> 05:43.709
Okay, I understand.
Good night.

05:43.711 --> 05:47.179
Can you see me
from up there?

05:47.181 --> 05:49.614
How many fingers
am I holding up?

05:49.616 --> 05:53.518
-Hi.
-You're still here?

05:53.520 --> 05:55.787
Yeah-huh.

05:55.789 --> 05:59.224
Very clever with
the shutting-the-door thing.

05:59.226 --> 06:01.226
Thank you.

06:01.228 --> 06:03.829
Are you talking to someone?

06:03.831 --> 06:06.498
No, I was talking in my sleep.
I'm sleeping right now.

06:06.500 --> 06:09.735
Oh. 'cause you're saying
some very interesting things.

06:09.737 --> 06:12.371
Could we talk about it
tomorrow when I wake up?

06:12.373 --> 06:16.074
Yeah. And you know,
some things are just
personal and private,

06:16.076 --> 06:17.576
And that's okay too.

06:17.578 --> 06:19.578
Thank you.

06:26.720 --> 06:29.721
Okay.
Just you and me.

06:29.723 --> 06:32.524
Do you have anything
you want to talk about?

06:32.526 --> 06:34.593
I'm a good listener.

06:38.932 --> 06:41.767
You don't just pick things up
and think that they're yours.

06:41.769 --> 06:44.336
Oh, my gosh!
Look what I found!

06:44.338 --> 06:46.905
You need to believe
in things.

06:46.907 --> 06:49.274
I might if my life
was as hunky-dory as yours.

06:49.276 --> 06:52.744
Oh, so you're saying
it's easier to believe
when things are going well?

06:52.746 --> 06:54.780
Things are going well.
I just got 10 bucks

06:54.782 --> 06:56.548
And this new purse
I just lent you.

06:56.550 --> 06:59.351
Then why won't you
believe in anything?

07:00.788 --> 07:03.789
How can you go through life
so blind, so trusting?

07:03.791 --> 07:05.724
I do trust
in certain things.

07:05.726 --> 07:07.726
Why? What is that?
I don't understand that.

07:07.728 --> 07:09.795
I don't know.
I just feel like I have
a better life because of it.

07:09.797 --> 07:13.031
You have a better life
because of look-at-ya!

07:13.033 --> 07:15.967
Your freak face is just
a collection of cells
and bone structure

07:15.969 --> 07:17.969
That was randomly
and somehow so perfectly
put together

07:17.971 --> 07:19.771
That if there is a force
that did that for you,

07:19.773 --> 07:22.474
I'll tell you right now,
he hates me.

07:22.476 --> 07:26.077
How has my deep, deep
teenage belief system
not rubbed off on you?

07:26.079 --> 07:28.814
Thomas jefferson, please.

07:28.816 --> 07:31.049
Fine.
What do we know about him?

07:31.051 --> 07:32.818
He's on both
my five-dollar bills.

07:32.820 --> 07:35.554
-He's on the two.
-I just said that.

07:35.556 --> 07:37.656
He wrote the declaration
of independence.

07:37.658 --> 07:39.291
-Lincoln.
-Jefferson.

07:39.293 --> 07:40.926
Do you even know
the difference between them?

07:40.928 --> 07:43.094
-Three bucks.
-Hi, girls.

07:43.096 --> 07:44.629
You aren't going to be
any help on this, are you?

07:44.631 --> 07:46.498
I have faith that somehow
it'll all get done.

07:46.500 --> 07:48.300
Yeah, by me, maya,
like always.

07:48.302 --> 07:51.803
And we're just going
to go over here.

07:51.805 --> 07:54.840
They burned joan of arc
at the stake because
they were afraid.

07:54.842 --> 07:56.341
Just like you're afraid
there are certain things

07:56.343 --> 07:57.776
That can't be explained
by science.

07:57.778 --> 08:00.412
They were afraid because
they believed in witches
and superstitions,

08:00.414 --> 08:02.614
Because they lacked
the knowledge to diagnose
her condition.

08:02.616 --> 08:05.417
Why do you have to
call it a condition?
She had a vision.

08:05.419 --> 08:07.853
Well, you say "vision,"
but you know vision,
properly diagnosed

08:07.855 --> 08:10.021
By a medical professional
is, "whoo!"

08:10.023 --> 08:13.959
Farkle, you did it.

08:13.961 --> 08:17.095
What I believe?
All wrong.

08:17.097 --> 08:19.664
I really respect
how you and your--

08:19.666 --> 08:22.634
Your scientific mind
have changed me.

08:22.636 --> 08:27.172
Oh, either that
or pffft!

08:27.174 --> 08:29.975
Okay, I can't work
with st. Huckleberry
the perfect.

08:29.977 --> 08:31.710
-Tell me about it.
-Riley, change partners?

08:31.712 --> 08:34.846
-Absolutely.
-Oh, of course,
you'd make it a square dance.

08:44.858 --> 08:47.826
Yes?

08:47.828 --> 08:48.860
We want to switch teams.

08:48.862 --> 08:50.996
"no can do, kids!
Once you make teams,

08:50.998 --> 08:53.365
"there's no switching back
because what I say goes,

08:53.367 --> 08:54.866
"because I have a whistle."

08:54.868 --> 08:57.869
I don't sound
like that.

08:57.871 --> 08:59.070
Kids:
You do.

09:00.841 --> 09:02.908
Okay, fine,
go ahead, switch.

09:02.910 --> 09:04.743
-Really?
-Sure.

09:07.314 --> 09:09.014
(blows whistle)

09:09.016 --> 09:11.182
Wow, he really does.

09:11.184 --> 09:13.718
-He's up to something.
-He's sneaky smart.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.520
Well, maybe we should just
stay the teams that we were.

09:15.522 --> 09:17.556
-Not a chance.
-I'm fine with my face.

09:19.826 --> 09:22.394
Maya, come on,
I won't bring it up again.

09:22.396 --> 09:24.095
You and I
are always partners.

09:24.097 --> 09:26.431
Riles, I just--
I just need a break.

09:26.433 --> 09:30.068
-From what?
-From you and all
these things you believe.

09:39.179 --> 09:41.246
I don't think
she really meant that, riley.

09:41.248 --> 09:44.349
She does.
She wants a break from me.

09:44.351 --> 09:47.185
Money changes people.

09:47.187 --> 09:49.688
-Maya?
-Maya's on vacation.

09:49.690 --> 09:51.756
Please leave a message
at the beep.

09:51.758 --> 09:54.693
(slurping)

09:54.695 --> 09:56.461
Oh, there's no beep,
is there?

09:56.463 --> 09:59.864
Look, riley and I are just
taking friendly little break.

09:59.866 --> 10:03.001
-It's no big thing.
-I'm not sure riley
sees it that way.

10:04.905 --> 10:06.271
The two of you
can't be apart.

10:06.273 --> 10:07.806
It shakes the foundations
of the whole world.

10:07.808 --> 10:09.608
That's not very scientific,
farkle.

10:09.610 --> 10:10.942
Some things are just true.

10:10.944 --> 10:12.877
I'm on vacation,

10:12.879 --> 10:14.946
Just like you're on vacation
from the cowboy.

10:14.948 --> 10:17.949
How does lucas have faith
in stuff he can't even see?

10:17.951 --> 10:20.318
How are me and him
even friends?

10:21.955 --> 10:24.155
Join me at the beach,
farkle.

10:27.728 --> 10:31.696
Is nothing real anymore?

10:37.404 --> 10:40.138
You know, it is possible
that you're too close.

10:41.775 --> 10:42.941
Whoa.

10:42.943 --> 10:46.611
Okay, let's just
do the assignment then.

10:46.613 --> 10:48.513
How do you feel
about thomas jefferson?

10:48.515 --> 10:50.982
Well, the more I read,
the more impressive he gets.

10:50.984 --> 10:53.685
Right? He never once wavered
from what he believed.

10:53.687 --> 10:55.487
I admire his strength
of character.

10:55.489 --> 10:56.955
So we completely agree
with each other.

10:56.957 --> 10:58.289
Looks like it.

10:58.291 --> 10:59.824
Yeah.

10:59.826 --> 11:02.861
Both:
So why do I need you?

11:02.863 --> 11:04.929
Both:
I don't know.

11:04.931 --> 11:06.765
I think joan of arc
had a screw loose.

11:06.767 --> 11:08.933
Eh, she was just a goofball
teenage girl

11:08.935 --> 11:11.002
That just wanted to show
what she thought about things.

11:11.004 --> 11:13.538
Sounds like
someone we know.

11:17.844 --> 11:20.645
Sounds like deep down,
you admire her.

11:20.647 --> 11:22.847
No.

11:22.849 --> 11:24.549
I don't admire her.

11:24.551 --> 11:26.618
I don't miss her

11:26.620 --> 11:29.254
And I am quite enjoying
my "me" time.

11:31.124 --> 11:33.858
I miss her.
I love her.

11:33.860 --> 11:35.994
What did you do to me,
farkle? (grunts)

11:35.996 --> 11:38.963
-Where are you going?
-Airport. You ruined
my whole vacation.

11:38.965 --> 11:41.900
(buzzing)

11:46.006 --> 11:48.239
-(both squealing)
-hi, peaches!

11:48.241 --> 11:51.009
You're back!
What'd you bring me?

11:51.011 --> 11:52.510
Nothing.
Where's my dinner?

11:52.512 --> 11:54.913
(clicks)

11:54.915 --> 11:57.282
Ooh, that's a good one.

12:02.889 --> 12:05.056
Okay, we know you're going
to say no, but--

12:05.058 --> 12:06.825
-Switch again.
-Thank you.

12:06.827 --> 12:08.993
So are you and maya
back together?

12:08.995 --> 12:11.329
No, riley and I have decided
to separate our work lives

12:11.331 --> 12:13.264
From our bay-window lives.

12:13.266 --> 12:16.000
Well, I'm sure that
will keep the love alive.

12:24.244 --> 12:27.412
Why did my father
assign us jefferson?

12:27.414 --> 12:30.749
I get that
he wrote the declaration
of independence.

12:30.751 --> 12:34.419
He said,
"we hold these truths
to be self-evident."

12:34.421 --> 12:35.954
Is that what he wants us
to know?

12:35.956 --> 12:39.190
That believing
in something is just
the obvious thing to do?

12:39.192 --> 12:41.025
Not to me.

12:41.027 --> 12:43.094
A scientist
needs to hold things
under a microscope, riley.

12:43.096 --> 12:45.230
That's the only way
to really understand
what's right in front of you.

12:45.232 --> 12:47.766
Did you ever think
that when you look
through a microscope,

12:47.768 --> 12:49.367
You miss the bigger picture?

12:49.369 --> 12:52.103
No.

12:52.105 --> 12:55.707
So joan of arc.
I think she was
kind of amazing.

12:55.709 --> 13:00.145
Lucas, what is it
that makes people
like her and you

13:00.147 --> 13:02.480
Have faith
in a higher power?

13:02.482 --> 13:05.450
Riley of arc is trying
to push me there,

13:05.452 --> 13:07.652
But I'm just
not the type of person

13:07.654 --> 13:08.953
That likes to be pushed,
you know?

13:08.955 --> 13:10.989
Yeah, I've noticed.

13:10.991 --> 13:13.658
I don't think you can
be pushed into something
this important anyway,

13:13.660 --> 13:15.193
Even by riley.

13:16.630 --> 13:19.330
Yeah. Joan of arc thought
she had a voice in her head.

13:19.332 --> 13:20.932
(laughs)

13:20.934 --> 13:24.969
Yeah. Look, don't expect it
to be big, loud and obvious.

13:24.971 --> 13:27.972
For me, most of what I believe
comes to me when it's quiet.

13:27.974 --> 13:30.909
Yeah?
I don't get a lot of quiet.

13:30.911 --> 13:32.277
What do you do?

13:32.279 --> 13:35.914
I don't know.
You just-- you just listen.

13:43.323 --> 13:47.759
Honey, are you okay?
Why are your eyes wide open?

13:47.761 --> 13:50.261
Do they really burn people
at the stake?

13:50.263 --> 13:52.831
No. Who put that idea
in your head?

13:52.833 --> 13:55.633
They're talking about him--
tony stark.

13:55.635 --> 13:59.003
They can't do that to him.
He's made of iron.

13:59.005 --> 14:03.308
Tony stark?
Oh. No, honey, calm down.

14:03.310 --> 14:06.010
They were talking
about joan of arc.
It was a long time ago.

14:06.012 --> 14:08.012
She was talking to people
and no one could see

14:08.014 --> 14:10.014
Who she was talking to.
It scared people.

14:10.016 --> 14:13.117
So if you're talking,
but no one is really there,

14:13.119 --> 14:15.153
They come after you?

14:15.155 --> 14:19.157
Auggie, this is not something
for you to be worried about,
okay?

14:19.159 --> 14:21.559
Okay, then I won't.

14:26.666 --> 14:28.666
(grunts)

14:28.668 --> 14:32.537
Is this why I didn't
hear you talking tonight?

14:32.539 --> 14:35.673
(muffled)
you wouldn't let anybody
get me, right?

14:35.675 --> 14:39.310
Auggie, nobody is going
to get you,

14:39.312 --> 14:40.845
Except me.

14:40.847 --> 14:42.981
Mommy?

14:42.983 --> 14:44.415
Yes, aug?

14:44.417 --> 14:47.852
You think daddy
will be okay without you
for a few more minutes?

14:47.854 --> 14:50.321
Yes. He's a big boy.
He'll be just fine.

14:50.323 --> 14:53.391
Cory:
<i>Topanga, I'm lonely!</i>

14:59.099 --> 15:01.833
Can I ask you
a very personal question?

15:01.835 --> 15:03.902
Are there any other kind?

15:03.904 --> 15:06.704
-Do you pray?
-All the time.

15:06.706 --> 15:08.239
-Isn't that sort of...
-Amazing.

15:08.241 --> 15:12.076
-...Greedy?
-Greedy? How?

15:12.078 --> 15:14.078
Shouldn't you leave something
for someone else?

15:14.080 --> 15:16.681
-Huh.
-Well, I think everyone
gets heard.

15:16.683 --> 15:18.883
See, I just don't get
how those things are possible.

15:18.885 --> 15:21.119
I mean, do you really believe
he hears everything you say?

15:21.121 --> 15:23.087
-Do you like computers?
-I do.

15:23.089 --> 15:27.292
Can I find out
everywhere you've been
with just one click?

15:27.294 --> 15:30.128
-Yeah.
-God can't do that?

15:32.465 --> 15:35.600
Morning, guys.
You get everything
sorted out?

15:35.602 --> 15:39.203
No. Why won't everybody
just believe everything
I believe?

15:39.205 --> 15:41.606
-They won't?
-No.

15:41.608 --> 15:43.608
How dare they?

15:43.610 --> 15:46.210
Farkle, I thought
men of science

15:46.212 --> 15:48.279
Were open
to new discoveries?

15:48.281 --> 15:50.882
Look, people, it's simple--
seeing is believing.

15:50.884 --> 15:53.284
So you don't believe
that joan of arc heard
the voice of--

15:53.286 --> 15:57.255
-God? First you'll have to
prove god to me.
-Okay.

15:57.257 --> 15:59.057
Okay, I'm right, or okay,
you're actually going--

15:59.059 --> 16:01.826
Take a deep breath, farkle.

16:01.828 --> 16:03.962
Now that air
that you just breathed in,

16:03.964 --> 16:07.065
That air that's between
you and me, what color is it?

16:07.067 --> 16:09.267
It's clear, mr. Matthews.
That's why I can see you.

16:09.269 --> 16:11.269
I believe in you
because I can see you.

16:11.271 --> 16:13.638
-That's your position?
-Yes.

16:13.640 --> 16:16.908
-Roy g. Biv.
-Uh-oh.

16:16.910 --> 16:19.777
-What?
-We learned about roy g. Biv
in first grade.

16:19.779 --> 16:23.181
Red, orange, yellow, green,
blue, indigo and violet.

16:23.183 --> 16:24.449
It's a rainbow.

16:24.451 --> 16:26.317
You got a prism on you,
farkle?

16:26.319 --> 16:30.188
No! Who would carry a--
why would you think-- yes.

16:30.190 --> 16:31.990
Great.

16:31.992 --> 16:35.293
So remind me
what this does, please.

16:35.295 --> 16:36.461
It slows down
the speed of light

16:36.463 --> 16:38.629
And refracts it into
the elemental spectrum
of colors.

16:38.631 --> 16:41.099
Riley:
Ooh, a rainbow.

16:41.101 --> 16:42.633
That's right.

16:42.635 --> 16:45.103
So this air
that's between you and me

16:45.105 --> 16:46.804
Isn't really clear
at all, is it?

16:46.806 --> 16:49.941
-Even though
we can't see that.
-Okay, but I don't see how--

16:49.943 --> 16:51.309
What's outside that window,
farkle?

16:51.311 --> 16:53.111
Flowers,
the fire escape,

16:53.113 --> 16:55.146
The street,
the people on the street,
apartment buildings.

16:55.148 --> 16:56.280
And what's in
the apartment buildings?

16:56.282 --> 16:58.116
I can't see that.

16:58.118 --> 17:01.152
People, families,
mothers, fathers, kids.

17:01.154 --> 17:04.989
-And beyond them?
-The sky, the stars,
the whole universe.

17:04.991 --> 17:07.792
All of it.
Every person, every child,

17:07.794 --> 17:10.728
Everything out there,
everything we see
and we don't see--

17:10.730 --> 17:13.464
All these shiny elements
of a force that
bound us together--

17:13.466 --> 17:16.968
I like to think of that
as a part of god refracted,

17:16.970 --> 17:19.203
Aspects of god
that I can see.

17:20.573 --> 17:22.373
What's the secret
to life, riley?

17:22.375 --> 17:24.342
People change people.

17:24.344 --> 17:28.079
We're here to discover
what it is we want
to believe in.

17:28.081 --> 17:30.314
And different people
believe in different things.

17:30.316 --> 17:32.383
But it doesn't hurt to listen
to people we love

17:32.385 --> 17:34.452
Before we decide
for ourselves.

17:36.723 --> 17:40.024
Oh. And, uh, lucas?

17:40.026 --> 17:42.427
-I'm in your daughter's room?
-Yeah.

17:56.209 --> 17:59.243
Just wanted
to say good night, bud.

17:59.245 --> 18:01.746
Daddy, you always
protect me, right?

18:01.748 --> 18:03.781
Don't you have faith
in us, bubba?

18:03.783 --> 18:05.083
I do.

18:05.085 --> 18:07.618
-So I'm safe?
-You are.

18:07.620 --> 18:09.787
You live in a place
where no one is going
to hurt you

18:09.789 --> 18:11.289
For saying your prayers
out loud.

18:11.291 --> 18:14.292
What?
Oh, I wasn't praying.

18:14.294 --> 18:16.427
I mean, I do pray.

18:16.429 --> 18:18.396
I pray in the bathtub.

18:18.398 --> 18:21.265
I pray I won't get sucked
down the drain.

18:21.267 --> 18:24.001
Well, it's working for you.

18:25.405 --> 18:28.239
Wait, so auggie,
who have you been talking to?

18:28.241 --> 18:31.676
Mrs. Svorski.

18:33.079 --> 18:35.880
I'm worried she has no one
to talk to anymore.

18:35.882 --> 18:37.615
Auggie, you know what?

18:37.617 --> 18:40.451
She's got people up there
that love her.

18:40.453 --> 18:42.453
And she's got you down here.

18:42.455 --> 18:45.323
Don't worry.
She's covered.

18:45.325 --> 18:47.458
So I could
still talk to her?

18:47.460 --> 18:49.460
It helps me
not miss her so much.

18:49.462 --> 18:51.162
Any time you want.

18:51.164 --> 18:52.997
Please say hi for us.

18:52.999 --> 18:55.399
I will.
Good night.

18:55.401 --> 18:57.468
Good night, bubba.

19:00.573 --> 19:02.807
Good night, you sweet boy.

19:10.583 --> 19:12.917
So today I got you a cookie.

19:12.919 --> 19:15.453
But I wasn't sure
where to send it,

19:15.455 --> 19:17.522
So I ate it.

19:17.524 --> 19:20.358
Tomorrow I'm getting you
a toy.

19:24.931 --> 19:27.765
We're all up here together
because we don't know who's
with who anymore.

19:27.767 --> 19:29.433
-Thomas jefferson.
-Joan of arc.

19:29.435 --> 19:32.436
Before he wrote
the declaration
of independence,

19:32.438 --> 19:34.839
Jefferson warmed up
with a little something
called...

19:34.841 --> 19:37.108
The virginia statute
of religious freedom.

19:37.110 --> 19:39.143
-Found it, did ya?
-You knew we would.

19:39.145 --> 19:43.214
He strongly believed
that in a truly
free society,

19:43.216 --> 19:45.516
Religion should be
a personal choice.

19:46.853 --> 19:48.853
Thanks to him
and what he believed,

19:48.855 --> 19:52.290
We live in a place
where we can listen
to what others have to say

19:52.292 --> 19:54.759
And then make decisions
for ourselves.

19:56.496 --> 19:58.829
So how can I not
do the same for you?

19:58.831 --> 20:01.666
Thanks, riley.

20:01.668 --> 20:04.635
Very enlightening, ladies.
Guys?

20:04.637 --> 20:07.572
Joan of arc was the fiercest
teenage girl there ever was,

20:07.574 --> 20:09.707
And I know some pretty fierce
teenage girls.

20:09.709 --> 20:11.576
(chuckles)

20:11.578 --> 20:14.045
She believed so much
in what she thought was right,

20:14.047 --> 20:16.247
Her beliefs inspired
a whole nation.

20:16.249 --> 20:18.583
Did god speak to her?
Who can say for sure?

20:18.585 --> 20:20.685
But there is no question
that she believed.

20:20.687 --> 20:24.188
And that's what gave her
a strong voice of her own.

20:24.190 --> 20:26.991
-Nice report, guys.
-Nice assignment,
mr. Matthews.

20:26.993 --> 20:29.160
Thanks, farkle.
I try.

20:29.162 --> 20:31.162
Want to know
what I learned to believe?

20:31.164 --> 20:32.496
Absolutely.

20:32.498 --> 20:36.667
We are somehow surrounded

20:36.669 --> 20:38.936
By the people we need
in our lives.

20:38.938 --> 20:41.939
They're right in front
of me.

20:41.941 --> 20:44.008
And I can see them.

20:44.010 --> 20:46.410
I don't know
how it happened

20:46.412 --> 20:49.714
That the four of us
are here together
in this place

20:49.716 --> 20:51.716
At this time
right now,

20:51.718 --> 20:55.586
That part's a mystery
to me.

20:55.588 --> 20:58.990
But I'm grateful
that it happened.

21:05.365 --> 21:08.232
What are you doing?

21:08.234 --> 21:11.402
Well, we went on
a pretty good journey
for five bucks, didn't we?

21:11.404 --> 21:15.539
It's worth it to me
to give someone else
the chance to go.

21:20.980 --> 21:23.781
-(both laugh)
-(bell rings)

21:36.496 --> 21:38.596
I love you
just the way you are

21:38.598 --> 21:41.165
And I never want you
to take a vacation
from me again

21:41.167 --> 21:42.900
And I will never try
to make you do any--

21:42.902 --> 21:44.468
I said a prayer last night.

21:44.470 --> 21:46.604
Can I say yay?

21:46.606 --> 21:48.606
It was real quiet.

21:48.608 --> 21:51.575
I was alone in my bedroom
looking out my window.

21:51.577 --> 21:54.979
And all those people
in all those buildings,

21:54.981 --> 21:58.416
I just-- I wanted them
to be taken care of.

21:58.418 --> 21:59.517
I love you.

21:59.519 --> 22:02.453
You were in my prayer
last night too, and my mom.

22:02.455 --> 22:04.355
Ooh, what did you pray for me?

22:04.357 --> 22:06.424
No, no, no, don't tell me.
That's between you and--

22:06.426 --> 22:10.494
I want you to have
an endless supply
of great days.

22:10.496 --> 22:12.863
Thank you.
What did you pray for yourself?

22:12.865 --> 22:15.499
Me? Nothing.

22:15.501 --> 22:17.601
I would never bug him
about me.

22:17.603 --> 22:22.373
Gee, I always bug him
about me.

22:22.375 --> 22:25.009
I like what you believe,
maya.

22:25.011 --> 22:27.211
Thanks, riley.

22:28.881 --> 22:33.050
I will always have
a lot to learn.
