(laughs) Yeah, no,
that's what I thought, but...

02:48.961 --> 02:51.213
Whatever.
I'll see you around, okay?

02:51.255 --> 02:52.923
Yeah, I'll see you.

02:54.216 --> 02:55.634
(elevator bell dings)

02:59.305 --> 03:00.806
You're here. Good.

03:00.848 --> 03:02.975
You're late.
What's the play?

03:03.017 --> 03:04.727
Better if I do the talking.

03:04.768 --> 03:06.687
That's what
you're paying me for.

03:06.729 --> 03:10.274
Oh, and, uh,
act surprised about the DNA.

03:10.316 --> 03:12.943
Much as I enjoy the high irony
of seeing the two of you

03:12.985 --> 03:14.445
on the same side of the table,

03:14.486 --> 03:15.779
why a meeting?

03:15.821 --> 03:17.489
A phone call
would have sufficed.

03:17.531 --> 03:19.491
-Preston Borders.
-What about him?

03:19.533 --> 03:21.160
His habeas petition.

03:21.201 --> 03:23.203
We understand it's based in part

03:23.245 --> 03:25.956
on a deathbed confession
by another convict.

03:25.998 --> 03:27.625
And this concerns
you and your client...

03:27.666 --> 03:29.376
I presume Detective Bosch
is your client.

03:29.418 --> 03:31.045
-He is.
-Concerns you how?

03:31.086 --> 03:32.963
We'd like to know
where the D.A. stands.

03:33.005 --> 03:34.298
Detective Bosch worked

03:34.340 --> 03:36.342
the Borders case,
testified at his trial.

03:37.718 --> 03:39.887
We're not disputing
the petition.

03:41.221 --> 03:43.349
-Why not?
-We have new DNA evidence

03:43.390 --> 03:45.893
that corroborates
the Olmer confession.

03:45.935 --> 03:48.479
A handkerchief collected
at the scene,

03:48.520 --> 03:50.856
not tested at the time.

03:50.898 --> 03:53.400
-Blood?
-Skin cells. Touch DNA.

03:53.442 --> 03:55.277
Didn't exist 20 years ago.

03:55.319 --> 03:56.862
How does that exonerate him?

03:56.904 --> 03:58.948
You'd release
a psychopathic sexual predator--

03:58.989 --> 04:02.159
a serial killer--
based on a jailhouse confession,

04:02.201 --> 04:04.203
-skin cells on a hankie?
-KENNEDY: If there's been

04:04.244 --> 04:05.746
a miscarriage of justice,
Detective,

04:05.788 --> 04:07.623
-what choice do we have?
-Justice was done.

04:07.665 --> 04:08.874
-Don't undo it.
-CHANDLER: Harry.

04:09.917 --> 04:11.794
Please wait outside.

04:22.596 --> 04:24.723
Alex, let me ask you,

04:24.765 --> 04:26.725
on the basis
of this new evidence...

04:26.767 --> 04:28.268
Yes?

04:28.310 --> 04:30.229
...do you now believe
Borders' contention

04:30.270 --> 04:33.107
the police planted the pendant
in his apartment?

04:33.148 --> 04:34.358
Outside the scope
of this inquiry.

04:34.400 --> 04:36.235
And once this inquiry is over,

04:36.276 --> 04:38.112
is my client in the crosshairs?

04:38.153 --> 04:39.488
Let's not get
ahead of ourselves.

04:40.531 --> 04:42.074
Too late.

04:42.116 --> 04:44.034
I'm already there.

04:45.786 --> 04:47.705
Thank you.

04:51.500 --> 04:52.960
That investigator, Henry.

04:53.002 --> 04:54.461
What about her?

04:54.503 --> 04:56.630
Her beef with you
personal or professional?

04:56.672 --> 04:58.757
-Is it that obvious?
-Pretty much.

04:58.799 --> 05:00.759
-Personal.
-You sleep with her?

05:00.801 --> 05:03.053
Dated. Briefly. Years ago.

05:03.095 --> 05:05.639
-End badly?
-What do you think?

05:05.681 --> 05:09.184
Well, personal could be useful
down the road.

05:13.355 --> 05:16.108
Borders' calls from prison
the last 12 months.

05:16.150 --> 05:18.152
I have my sources, too.

05:18.193 --> 05:20.988
I'll have Hector
get right on them.

05:21.030 --> 05:22.531
Maybe we'll get lucky.

05:22.573 --> 05:24.742
Maybe Borders got careless.

05:24.783 --> 05:26.118
That's the last thing he is.

05:26.160 --> 05:27.745
They're gonna let
this scumbag go

05:27.786 --> 05:29.329
and try and crucify me.

05:29.371 --> 05:31.832
I will not let it come to that.

07:17.104 --> 07:18.564
About fucking time.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.366
Thanks for showing up.

07:29.408 --> 07:31.952
(indistinct chatter)

07:31.994 --> 07:34.663
Powers showed up this morning
with a knee brace.

07:34.705 --> 07:35.747
Sympathy prop.

07:35.789 --> 07:37.457
He's a street dog,
not a house cat.

07:37.499 --> 07:39.251
He is dying on the storm desk.

07:39.293 --> 07:41.837
We're stuck doing
pissant incident reports

07:41.879 --> 07:44.173
when we could be-- should be--
working our murders.

07:44.214 --> 07:46.466
I agree. It's a waste
of time and talent.

07:46.508 --> 07:47.759
Like anybody cares.

07:47.801 --> 07:51.513
These new cops,
these... millennials.

07:51.555 --> 07:54.057
What do they know?
They don't know.

07:54.099 --> 07:55.809
Fuck 'em.

07:55.851 --> 07:59.313
History should matter.
Respect should be paid.

07:59.354 --> 08:01.273
Yeah, a little credit
where credit's due.

08:01.315 --> 08:02.566
Yeah. Take Crate.

08:02.608 --> 08:04.234
That man's a legend.

08:04.276 --> 08:07.154
He was on the task force
that brought down Eddie Nash

08:07.196 --> 08:08.363
for the Wonderland Murders.

08:08.405 --> 08:09.615
And weren't you
on Night Stalker?

08:10.657 --> 08:12.201
That was my first redball.

08:12.242 --> 08:13.285
No kidding.

08:13.327 --> 08:15.704
We linked a sneaker
tread pattern

08:15.746 --> 08:18.207
from a Bay Area vic's
facial abrasions

08:18.248 --> 08:20.459
to a flower bed
at a Burbank crime scene.

08:20.500 --> 08:24.046
Then Feinstein screws the pooch
at a press conference--

08:24.087 --> 08:27.132
cat out of the bag--
Ramirez tosses the shoes

08:27.174 --> 08:30.594
off the Golden Gate Bridge...
back to square one.

08:30.636 --> 08:33.305
Two more vics before we catch
that motherless fuck.

08:33.347 --> 08:35.766
Wow.

08:35.807 --> 08:37.476
You've had a hell of a career.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.895
You both have.

08:39.937 --> 08:41.563
I see where you're going
with this.

08:41.605 --> 08:44.358
What? No, no, no.
I just...

08:44.399 --> 08:47.069
You know, you get to be
a certain age, like us,

08:47.110 --> 08:49.154
and you start thinking
about the next chapter.

08:49.196 --> 08:51.657
Last thing you want to do
is overstay your welcome.

08:51.698 --> 08:53.951
Look, I know that you've thought
about pulling the pin.

08:53.992 --> 08:55.494
You can't beat Father Time.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.454
Lieutenant, I hate to admit it,

08:57.537 --> 09:00.749
but sometimes I think,
eh, you might be right.

09:00.791 --> 09:02.459
It happens to us all.

09:02.501 --> 09:04.586
-When the time comes...
-It comes.

09:04.628 --> 09:05.963
He won't go quietly.

09:06.004 --> 09:07.881
I guarantee you that.

09:07.923 --> 09:10.259
That man came back to work
after taking two in the gut.

09:12.427 --> 09:15.472
You let me know
if you need my help, you know,

09:15.514 --> 09:17.599
breaking the news to him.

09:22.521 --> 09:23.981
CRATE:
I hope, for his sake,

09:24.022 --> 09:25.482
it doesn't come down
to a hearing test.

09:25.524 --> 09:26.942
How's that?

09:26.984 --> 09:29.736
You ever notice how often
Barrel doesn't respond

09:29.778 --> 09:32.281
-when you talk to him?
-Mm-hmm.

09:32.322 --> 09:35.701
His exes, they always complained
he never listened.

09:35.742 --> 09:37.744
Turns out there's a reason.

09:37.786 --> 09:40.497
PIERCE:
Oh, yeah? What's that?

09:40.539 --> 09:43.583
Well, the gunfire
he was exposed to in 'Nam.

09:43.625 --> 09:45.419
Serious hearing loss.

09:45.460 --> 09:48.463
I mean, he's got hearing aids,
but does he use 'em? (sighs)

09:48.505 --> 09:50.716
Sometimes I think
he wants to tune me out.

09:58.223 --> 10:01.518
Fucker's got a gun.

10:01.560 --> 10:05.272
-Laura O'Connor?
-That's me.

10:05.314 --> 10:08.191
Detective Edgar, LAPD.

10:08.233 --> 10:09.943
Well, somebody finally
listen to me

10:09.985 --> 10:11.320
about these damn drag racers?

10:11.361 --> 10:13.822
I'm sorry.
Investigating a homicide.

10:13.864 --> 10:15.407
Oh.

10:15.449 --> 10:17.200
Yeah, local delinquents.

10:17.242 --> 10:18.618
But no bodies, alas.

10:18.660 --> 10:20.245
What can I do to help you?

10:20.287 --> 10:23.123
Aircraft I saw fly out of here
yesterday afternoon.

10:23.165 --> 10:24.583
-Mm-hmm.
-Around 4:00.

10:24.624 --> 10:25.959
White prop plane.

10:26.001 --> 10:28.462
That would be the Twin Otter.

10:28.503 --> 10:30.547
-Skydiving?
-(laughs) God, I hope not.

10:30.589 --> 10:32.674
Those folks can barely
get on and off the plane,

10:32.716 --> 10:33.967
much less jump out of it.

10:34.009 --> 10:35.969
-They have a schedule?
-Random.

10:36.011 --> 10:38.930
Couple times a week, maybe,
last six, eight months.

10:38.972 --> 10:41.683
All hours, no rhyme or reason.

10:41.725 --> 10:43.518
Same passengers every trip?

10:43.560 --> 10:45.812
Oh, way too far away to tell
from the tower,

10:45.854 --> 10:47.731
-but day-trippers for sure.
-How do you know?

10:47.773 --> 10:49.316
No luggage ever.

10:50.984 --> 10:52.194
Flight plans?

10:52.235 --> 10:55.072
Long as they fly VFR-- visual--

10:55.113 --> 10:56.990
no radar, no assistance
from the tower,

10:57.032 --> 10:58.700
they can come and go
as they please.

10:58.742 --> 11:00.327
Homeland Security knows
about this?

11:00.369 --> 11:03.246
(chuckles)
Still a free country, Detective.

11:03.288 --> 11:05.248
Who owns the Otter?

11:05.290 --> 11:08.126
I will text you the files. Okay?

11:11.338 --> 11:13.507
-(cell phone ringing)
-Jerry.

11:13.548 --> 11:15.258
EDGAR (on phone):
Harry, where are you?

11:15.300 --> 11:17.469
Just left the D.A.'s office.

11:17.511 --> 11:18.929
Looks like they're
going forward.

11:18.970 --> 11:22.099
-That sucks.
-It is what it is.

11:22.140 --> 11:23.767
You hear back
from the Med Board?

11:23.809 --> 11:26.103
It's on.
I'll text you the address.

11:26.144 --> 11:28.063
What about you?

11:28.105 --> 11:31.566
White van's at the clinic.
Garcia showed up around 8:00.

11:31.608 --> 11:34.611
He and the van driver went in.
Nobody else.

11:34.653 --> 11:36.655
No shills, no patients?

11:36.696 --> 11:38.448
EDGAR:
Not while I was there.

11:38.490 --> 11:39.574
What about our plane?

11:39.616 --> 11:42.577
No flight plans, no schedule.

11:42.619 --> 11:43.995
It goes and comes.

11:44.037 --> 11:45.497
Who owns it?

11:45.539 --> 11:49.042
Western Sandblast.
P.O. box.

11:49.084 --> 11:52.796
Invoices to an e-mail address.

11:52.838 --> 11:54.881
I put Pierce on it.

11:54.923 --> 11:56.716
Okay, see you at the meet.

12:01.471 --> 12:03.140
BILLETS:
Hi.

12:06.059 --> 12:08.687
Lieutenant.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.564
-Captain Cooper. (sighs)
-A word?

12:16.361 --> 12:18.738
Two words, actually.

12:19.906 --> 12:21.366
Crate and Barrel.

12:21.408 --> 12:23.535
The other two officers
were equally at fault.

12:23.577 --> 12:26.872
This is the perfect opportunity
to clear out the deadwood.

12:26.913 --> 12:28.957
-They are not deadwood.
-They are way past

12:28.999 --> 12:30.792
their "sell by" date.

12:30.834 --> 12:32.335
You know it, and I know it.

12:32.377 --> 12:35.088
COMPSTAT is next week.

12:35.130 --> 12:36.882
Our quarterly numbers
are outstanding.

12:36.923 --> 12:39.259
Let's not let this little
incident dull that shine.

12:39.301 --> 12:41.595
-We can't force 'em to retire.
-No.

12:41.636 --> 12:42.888
But we can move them.

12:42.929 --> 12:44.931
Where?

12:44.973 --> 12:47.559
-I was thinking CAPs.
-CAPs. Jesus!

12:47.601 --> 12:48.977
Or juvie.

12:49.019 --> 12:51.521
-Your choice.
-(sighs)

12:51.563 --> 12:53.190
Given your long history,

12:53.231 --> 12:56.234
maybe they should
hear it from you.

12:56.276 --> 12:57.944
Loop me in on how it goes.

13:08.079 --> 13:10.081
Here's what we have on Garcia
and his clinic.

13:10.123 --> 13:12.292
Apologize in advance
if I'm a little ripe.

13:12.334 --> 13:14.669
We only get to go undercover
a few times a year.

13:14.711 --> 13:18.340
I like to do it right, so I
stopped showering last Tuesday.

13:18.381 --> 13:19.633
What about this
Garcia character?

13:19.674 --> 13:21.218
Why hasn't he lost his license?

13:21.259 --> 13:23.428
JENSEN: You mean prosecute
one of these doctors?

13:23.470 --> 13:25.555
I mean, the doctors are just
bit characters anyway.

13:25.597 --> 13:27.224
In L.A. County,
Armenian and Russian gangs

13:27.265 --> 13:28.308
run the pill mills.

13:28.350 --> 13:29.935
What about farther out?

13:29.976 --> 13:31.478
I thought the clinic
was in Pacoima.

13:31.520 --> 13:33.480
It is. We followed a van
to Whiteman Airport.

13:33.522 --> 13:36.399
Full of shills.
Flew off to God-knows-where.

13:36.441 --> 13:38.109
Charlie Hovan might know.

13:38.151 --> 13:40.820
-He's our contact at the DEA.
-What's his number?

13:40.862 --> 13:42.030
JENSEN:
No, no, no. He calls you.

13:42.072 --> 13:43.615
We'll put him in touch.

13:44.824 --> 13:46.409
(engine starts)

13:49.120 --> 13:50.872
WEBSTER:
Not much blood.

13:50.914 --> 13:52.916
ROBERTSON: I don't think
they shot him in the trunk.

13:52.958 --> 13:54.501
WEBSTER: Maybe got something off
dry cleaning.

13:54.543 --> 13:56.419
ROBERTSON:
Yeah, maybe.

13:56.461 --> 13:59.548
-VIN plate's missing.
-What about the other four?

13:59.589 --> 14:00.840
I'll check.

14:00.882 --> 14:02.133
If they're all missing,
you're dealing

14:02.175 --> 14:04.052
with a crew
really knows its shit.

14:04.094 --> 14:06.763
Any local gangsters
come to mind?

14:06.805 --> 14:11.768
Barrio Mojado, 38th Street.
Get you a list.

14:11.810 --> 14:12.852
All right.

14:12.894 --> 14:14.771
See what prints come back.

14:14.813 --> 14:17.357
Bet it's a fistful of felons.
(chuckles)

14:17.399 --> 14:19.359
No doubt.

14:22.279 --> 14:23.989
(sighs)

14:24.030 --> 14:25.865
Crate and Barrel
ought to be doing this shit.

14:25.907 --> 14:27.742
I should be out on the street
banging heads

14:27.784 --> 14:28.827
and keeping the peace.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.579
Please stop talking, please.

14:30.620 --> 14:31.621
Just shoot me.

14:31.663 --> 14:33.915
(chuckles)
Don't tempt me.

14:33.957 --> 14:35.125
VEGA:
Sergeant.

14:35.166 --> 14:38.086
Detective Vega.

14:38.128 --> 14:39.921
Lieutenant's expecting you.
I'll take you back.

14:39.963 --> 14:41.590
Oh, no need.
I know the way.

14:41.631 --> 14:43.091
All right.

14:47.012 --> 14:49.347
Cadillac walk.
Where's she from?

14:49.389 --> 14:52.726
-Wilshire. D-2, Robbery.
-A transfer?

14:52.767 --> 14:55.228
What, taking a plum seat
at the Homicide table?

14:55.270 --> 14:56.980
It comes down to who you know.

14:57.022 --> 14:58.857
(Powers scoffs)

15:00.859 --> 15:02.569
Or who wants to know you.

15:04.487 --> 15:06.323
What are you insinuating?

15:06.364 --> 15:08.658
Might be L.T.'s next ex.

15:08.700 --> 15:11.536
I'm just saying.

15:11.578 --> 15:13.913
Clearly, the online
sensitivity training

15:13.955 --> 15:15.248
isn't working for you.

15:15.290 --> 15:16.458
(scoffs)

15:16.499 --> 15:19.461
Let's find you something to do.

15:19.502 --> 15:22.505
Keep the mind occupied...

15:22.547 --> 15:24.841
so your mouth stays shut.

15:29.137 --> 15:30.513
Happy to be here.

15:30.555 --> 15:31.931
BILLETS:
Well, happy to have you.

15:31.973 --> 15:33.391
It's been a long time coming.

15:33.433 --> 15:35.143
You earned it. You deserve it.

15:35.185 --> 15:37.270
You should have been here
years ago.

15:37.312 --> 15:38.813
I appreciate you pushing.

15:38.855 --> 15:40.106
Hey, self-interest.

15:40.148 --> 15:42.734
I want the best people
I can get, so...

15:42.776 --> 15:44.819
Let me introduce you
to your new partner.

15:44.861 --> 15:47.614
Uh, Lieutenant, I-I know
it's only my first day.

15:47.656 --> 15:49.699
The rumor I heard was that...

15:49.741 --> 15:51.242
Okay, um, stop you there.

15:51.284 --> 15:53.536
Hollywood Homicide is here
until it's not.

15:54.996 --> 15:57.707
That's why I need
to get you started.

15:59.459 --> 16:00.585
(sighs)

16:01.795 --> 16:04.339
(phone ringing)

16:04.381 --> 16:06.299
Arias, what's up?

16:06.341 --> 16:08.927
ARIAS (on phone):
Your boy bailed on us.

16:08.968 --> 16:10.428
Gary Wise?

16:10.470 --> 16:13.306
M-I-fucking-A, man.
Saw him this morning.

16:13.348 --> 16:15.642
Said he was gonna bring Bo Jonas
to a follow-up meet,

16:15.684 --> 16:16.893
but he never showed.

16:16.935 --> 16:18.645
I don't know what to tell you.

16:18.687 --> 16:20.021
I haven't heard from him.

16:20.063 --> 16:22.899
I could give a shit
about your CI,

16:22.941 --> 16:24.526
but I need Jonas.

16:24.567 --> 16:28.238
We got no leads
on who shot those kids. Zero.

16:28.279 --> 16:29.906
I'll reach out again.

16:29.948 --> 16:31.825
I appreciate it.

16:33.868 --> 16:35.787
CIs.

16:39.207 --> 16:41.918
Gary. J.

16:41.960 --> 16:43.503
Hit me back.

16:43.545 --> 16:47.173
Charlie Hovan, DEA.

16:47.215 --> 16:49.467
Nick and Nellie said
you wanted to talk to me.

16:49.509 --> 16:51.344
Thanks for taking the time.

16:51.386 --> 16:53.763
-You under?
-14 months.

16:53.805 --> 16:55.181
They tell you what
we're looking at?

16:55.223 --> 16:57.684
None of the scumbags
we're tracking

16:57.726 --> 16:59.185
move their shills by plane.

16:59.227 --> 17:01.980
Someone is,
and they're dropping bodies.

17:02.021 --> 17:03.314
How many so far?

17:03.356 --> 17:05.358
One for sure.

17:05.400 --> 17:06.860
Maybe two that we know of.

17:06.901 --> 17:08.236
Father and son.

17:08.278 --> 17:10.780
One, maybe two.

17:10.822 --> 17:12.449
That's a blip.

17:13.658 --> 17:15.618
What about the Garcia clinic?

17:15.660 --> 17:17.954
Is it on your radar?

17:17.996 --> 17:20.331
Look, we're after big fish.

17:20.373 --> 17:22.041
Major dealers, heavyweights.

17:22.083 --> 17:23.585
Gangs, cartels.

17:23.626 --> 17:26.755
Pill mills, clinics,
docs, shills,

17:26.796 --> 17:28.965
that's just mop-up
after the show.

17:29.007 --> 17:31.259
Sorry to waste your time.

17:31.301 --> 17:33.261
Don't sweat it.

17:33.303 --> 17:34.804
It does sound like
you ran into

17:34.846 --> 17:36.347
some real squirrelly shit,
though.

17:36.389 --> 17:38.933
Shills on planes.
That's crazy.

17:38.975 --> 17:41.978
If it develops into
something more than

17:42.020 --> 17:45.565
a local homicide,
circle back to me.

17:48.818 --> 17:51.237
Just a blip?

17:51.279 --> 17:53.573
Squirrel shit.

17:53.615 --> 17:56.159
PIERCE:
This was last week.

17:56.201 --> 17:57.410
Pops was out of the store,

17:57.452 --> 18:00.038
and junior had a run-in
with this dude.

18:05.210 --> 18:08.254
We sent this picture around.
Nothing so far.

18:08.296 --> 18:10.965
Okay, put me to work.

18:11.007 --> 18:13.051
-How are you at warrants?
-Wired for sound.

18:13.092 --> 18:14.719
I got a friendly, go-to judge.

18:14.761 --> 18:18.181
Well, we need a warrant
for Jose Jr.'s cell phone calls,

18:18.223 --> 18:21.017
texts and e-mails,
credit cards, ATMs and...

18:21.059 --> 18:22.393
I'll get my desk squared away.

18:22.435 --> 18:24.020
All right, great.

18:24.062 --> 18:26.356
Hey, let me know when
you're done writing that up.

18:26.397 --> 18:28.900
I'll go get it signed,
no problem.

18:36.783 --> 18:39.410
Let me see your hands, shitbird.

18:39.452 --> 18:41.454
(laughter)

18:44.833 --> 18:48.419
-Ryan Rodgers.
-Harry Bosch.

18:48.461 --> 18:50.630
Jesus Christ,
I see you're making the most

18:50.672 --> 18:51.798
of your retirement.

18:51.840 --> 18:54.759
Sun and surf.
Wake and bake.

18:54.801 --> 18:56.511
Is that medical or recreational?

18:56.553 --> 18:57.679
What's the difference?

18:57.720 --> 18:58.972
Join me?

18:59.013 --> 19:01.474
Shit, no, man, I'm on duty.

19:01.516 --> 19:03.893
Oh, you're always on duty.

19:03.935 --> 19:06.771
-You're one of those guys.
-Yeah, I guess I am.

19:06.813 --> 19:08.898
Those for me?

19:10.733 --> 19:12.318
You kept a lot.

19:12.360 --> 19:13.945
I kept all of it.

19:13.987 --> 19:17.073
-Borders was my first serial.
-Mine, too.

19:17.115 --> 19:20.785
We did good work.
Caught that fucker.

19:20.827 --> 19:23.746
Least we could do
for the family.

19:23.788 --> 19:26.583
-The kid sister?
-Dinah.

19:26.624 --> 19:28.334
She used to call me
every few months.

19:28.376 --> 19:30.003
She wanted to get
her sister's pendant back.

19:30.044 --> 19:31.629
The seahorse.

19:31.671 --> 19:33.381
Of course,
she had to wait until after

19:33.423 --> 19:35.008
all the appeals were finished.

19:35.049 --> 19:37.302
Took me seven years.
I got it done.

19:37.343 --> 19:39.304
Good job, brother.

19:39.345 --> 19:40.722
Thanks for pulling these.

19:40.763 --> 19:43.683
No big deal.
I already had 'em pulled.

19:43.725 --> 19:45.435
To refresh my memory.

19:45.476 --> 19:47.103
For the habeas hearing?

19:47.145 --> 19:51.399
And to scratch
an itch of my own.

19:51.441 --> 19:53.902
How the hell I missed
this Olmer character.

19:53.943 --> 19:55.612
You and me both.

19:55.653 --> 19:58.406
I went through everything
with a fine-tooth comb.

19:58.448 --> 20:01.326
There wasn't a suspect,
person of interest, a wit.

20:01.367 --> 20:03.661
Nothing.

20:03.703 --> 20:05.330
He ain't in there, Harry.

20:05.371 --> 20:06.831
Not a whisper.

20:08.750 --> 20:11.085
-Any doubts?
-That we got the right guy?

20:11.127 --> 20:13.880
Not a scin-fucking-tilla.

20:18.092 --> 20:19.928
So, what's keeping you up
at night?

20:19.969 --> 20:22.221
Same as you.
I know it's a scam,

20:22.263 --> 20:24.807
but how do we prove it
before the hearing?

20:24.849 --> 20:28.311
Remember what I told you
on the scene?

20:28.353 --> 20:29.562
The Laura syndrome?

20:29.604 --> 20:32.106
Never fall in love
with the victim.

20:33.149 --> 20:34.984
But I did.

20:36.152 --> 20:37.779
And I think you did, too.

20:43.284 --> 20:46.245
(phone ringing)

20:46.287 --> 20:48.414
Edgar.

20:48.456 --> 20:50.625
Yeah, I know him. Why?

20:59.133 --> 21:00.843
20 minutes.

21:03.888 --> 21:05.556
(shouts in Kreyol)

21:05.598 --> 21:07.392
Fuck!

21:13.815 --> 21:15.942
-So, what do I tell them?
-The truth.

21:15.984 --> 21:17.360
Cooper's throwing them
under the bus.

21:17.402 --> 21:20.363
You know I can't do that.

21:22.198 --> 21:24.242
Just tell them it's temporary,
till things cool off.

21:24.283 --> 21:26.327
Well, they'll see right through
that bullshit, too.

21:26.369 --> 21:27.870
Well, those are your options.

21:27.912 --> 21:30.206
Truth or white lie.
Unvarnished or varnished.

21:32.041 --> 21:35.003
I guess I'll varnish it
a little.

21:35.044 --> 21:36.796
Barrel ever tell you
about his suicide mission?

21:36.838 --> 21:38.423
Firebase Ripcord.

21:38.464 --> 21:40.550
I have never heard him talk
about Vietnam.

21:40.591 --> 21:45.221
So, Firebase Ripcord, deep in
country, Ho Chi Minh trail.

21:45.263 --> 21:49.350
NVA had it under siege for
23 days, outnumbered ten to one.

21:49.392 --> 21:51.019
Casualties were so heavy,
the Army asked

21:51.060 --> 21:52.645
for volunteers from other units.

21:52.687 --> 21:56.607
So Barrel, 19-year-old sergeant,
said, "Sign me up."

21:56.649 --> 21:59.235
-He volunteered?
-Here's the kicker.

21:59.277 --> 22:02.613
He was just a couple of weeks
short of finishing his tour,

22:02.655 --> 22:05.074
hopping a freedom bird
and rotating back to the world.

22:05.116 --> 22:09.495
So, that's Barrel.
The kind of man he is.

22:09.537 --> 22:11.330
So, you're saying
he will suck it up

22:11.372 --> 22:13.541
-and make the best of it?
-Not what I'm saying.

22:13.583 --> 22:15.501
He'll hate it, hate you for it,
but he'll do it

22:15.543 --> 22:16.836
'cause he's squared away.

22:16.878 --> 22:18.796
(sighs)
Well, thanks a lot.

22:18.838 --> 22:20.381
You-you've been a great comfort.

22:21.466 --> 22:23.259
Oh. She'll cheer you up.

22:23.301 --> 22:25.470
-Hey, Cheryl.
-Harry.

22:25.511 --> 22:27.680
Sorry I'm late.
Sig alert on the 101.

22:27.722 --> 22:29.891
Overturned big rig.
A lookie-loo carnival.

22:29.932 --> 22:31.851
You want to join us?

22:31.893 --> 22:33.603
Oh, rain check. Got plans.

22:33.644 --> 22:36.731
What plans? You mean
going over old case files?

22:36.773 --> 22:38.441
I'm having dinner
with my daughter.

22:38.483 --> 22:39.859
In-N-Out.

22:39.901 --> 22:41.319
Mm. Animal fries.

22:41.360 --> 22:44.238
Exactly. Enjoy your evening.

22:46.616 --> 22:48.785
ESPINOSA: Your number was
on his start screen.

22:48.826 --> 22:50.745
Voice mail.

22:50.787 --> 22:53.581
Trying to reach him all day.

22:53.623 --> 22:55.750
What's RHD's interest?

22:55.792 --> 22:59.087
His old man was on the job.

22:59.128 --> 23:00.713
EDGAR:
Family been notified?

23:00.755 --> 23:01.923
ESPINOSA:
It's in the works.

23:01.964 --> 23:04.509
You know him?

23:07.261 --> 23:11.057
He was my CI.

23:24.195 --> 23:26.197
♪ ♪

23:44.215 --> 23:47.385
Aren't cops and prosecutors
usually on the same side?

23:47.426 --> 23:49.470
Not always the case.

23:49.512 --> 23:52.056
You learning anything
down there?

23:52.098 --> 23:55.059
Gotten really good
at copying, collating

23:55.101 --> 23:59.105
and redacting thousand-page
documents with a Sharpie.

23:59.147 --> 24:00.565
BOSCH:
Making friends?

24:00.606 --> 24:02.733
It's not summer camp, Dad.

24:06.737 --> 24:08.531
I saw you this morning.

24:09.782 --> 24:12.118
Didn't say hi?

24:12.160 --> 24:14.787
Well, you were engrossed
in conversation with someone.

24:14.829 --> 24:16.247
I didn't want to interrupt.

24:17.915 --> 24:20.710
He looked older.

24:20.751 --> 24:23.129
Everyone there is older than me.

24:24.964 --> 24:27.341
I thought you had a boyfriend
back at school, Mads.

24:29.093 --> 24:31.804
Yeah, a boyfriend,
not a husband.

24:33.848 --> 24:36.475
You really want to discuss
my personal life?

24:36.517 --> 24:38.603
Not especially.

24:38.644 --> 24:41.606
The other day,
when I came in at dawn...

24:41.647 --> 24:43.441
Uh-huh.

24:43.482 --> 24:45.943
Tom and I drove down to Cabrillo
Beach to see the grunion run.

24:45.985 --> 24:47.987
Did they show up?

24:48.029 --> 24:51.282
It was epic. New moon.

24:52.491 --> 24:54.660
I bet that opened his eyes.

24:54.702 --> 24:56.579
He's from Ohio.

24:56.621 --> 24:59.457
California grunion run?

24:59.498 --> 25:01.542
Never seen nothing like it.

25:21.479 --> 25:22.855
Why did... Hey.

25:22.897 --> 25:24.273
(piano stops)

25:24.315 --> 25:26.817
Why did they shoot him
so many times?

25:26.859 --> 25:28.444
(sighs)

25:28.486 --> 25:30.154
We don't know yet.

25:30.196 --> 25:34.492
But every single shot
will be assessed and justified.

25:34.533 --> 25:37.620
Was this? Justified?

25:37.662 --> 25:40.373
The 911 call
said Vasquez had a gun.

25:40.414 --> 25:42.500
But he didn't.

25:42.541 --> 25:44.585
The responding officers
had to assume that he did.

25:44.627 --> 25:47.171
And when they confronted him, he
failed to follow their commands.

25:47.213 --> 25:49.257
Well, maybe he was nervous.

25:49.298 --> 25:51.175
Maybe, uh...

25:51.217 --> 25:54.512
maybe he was scared.

25:54.553 --> 25:56.347
What do you think?

25:57.932 --> 26:00.059
Keeping an open mind.

26:00.101 --> 26:03.729
(chuckles)
It seems clear to me.

26:04.981 --> 26:07.566
Jun. (sighs)

26:07.608 --> 26:10.194
There are hundreds
of thousands of interactions

26:10.236 --> 26:12.822
between police and the public
in this city every year.

26:12.863 --> 26:14.448
Only a handful end like this.

26:14.490 --> 26:17.576
But these are the ones
that people remember.

26:17.618 --> 26:21.539
I'm worried about how
this could blow back on you.

26:21.580 --> 26:23.791
It's the department
I worry about.

26:23.833 --> 26:27.586
Babe, you are the department.

26:29.463 --> 26:33.134
You need to think
about the future.

26:33.175 --> 26:36.595
Your future.

26:43.352 --> 26:45.271
MADDIE:
Is that her?

26:46.522 --> 26:48.399
She worked
at a recording studio.

26:48.441 --> 26:51.027
That's where she met him.

26:51.068 --> 26:53.362
Preston Borders,

26:53.404 --> 26:55.781
trust fund snot,
wannabe rock star.

26:57.033 --> 26:59.285
She caught his eye.

27:00.453 --> 27:02.163
He looks like a creep.

27:02.204 --> 27:04.332
Well, Danielle thought so, too.

27:04.373 --> 27:05.791
But he kept pressing her.

27:05.833 --> 27:07.668
She finally agreed
to go out with him.

27:07.710 --> 27:09.378
But he came on strong, too fast.

27:09.420 --> 27:10.713
She ended the date early.

27:10.755 --> 27:12.340
Couple hours later,

27:12.381 --> 27:15.801
he came back to her building,
wasted on something,

27:15.843 --> 27:17.428
leaning on her buzzer.

27:17.470 --> 27:20.014
She threatened to call the cops,
and he split.

27:20.056 --> 27:21.640
How do you know all this?

27:21.682 --> 27:23.893
She told her friends.

27:25.936 --> 27:28.272
Two weeks later,
he murdered her.

27:33.694 --> 27:35.654
No forced entry.

27:35.696 --> 27:37.656
She let him in.

27:37.698 --> 27:40.701
We estimated he was in there
for four hours.

27:40.743 --> 27:44.455
Raped her, strangled her
with her own belt.

27:44.497 --> 27:47.625
Took the pendant she was wearing

27:47.666 --> 27:50.836
as a trophy.

27:53.005 --> 27:56.801
-He didn't leave any DNA?
-No, he was wearing gloves.

27:57.927 --> 28:00.346
He was careful.

28:00.388 --> 28:02.765
Organized.

28:02.807 --> 28:04.767
Calm.

28:06.852 --> 28:09.397
Took his time.

28:12.608 --> 28:15.111
There's something bothering you
about this.

28:15.152 --> 28:17.696
Well, I was
a newly minted detective.

28:17.738 --> 28:20.157
I wasn't in charge
of the investigation.

28:20.199 --> 28:22.535
Do you think things were missed?

28:23.702 --> 28:25.871
I didn't then.

28:25.913 --> 28:27.123
And now?

28:29.583 --> 28:32.420
It was a long time ago.

28:38.426 --> 28:41.387
(indistinct chatter)

28:49.812 --> 28:51.856
Thanks for coming.

28:51.897 --> 28:55.317
Course.

28:55.359 --> 28:58.279
Can't have you drinking alone.

28:58.320 --> 29:01.490
Hmm. Bottle or glass?

29:01.532 --> 29:04.160
Bottle.

29:24.221 --> 29:26.223
Up all night?

29:27.475 --> 29:29.477
Pretty much.

29:33.606 --> 29:36.567
This was not your fault, J.

29:36.609 --> 29:40.237
Yeah, feels like it.

29:40.279 --> 29:42.740
They should have been
more careful.

29:44.158 --> 29:46.744
I vouched for them.

29:46.785 --> 29:48.996
So it's on me, too.

30:05.513 --> 30:08.015
-Jose.
-Professor.

30:08.057 --> 30:09.642
How long have you been out here?

30:09.683 --> 30:11.519
Uh, about an hour or so.

30:11.560 --> 30:14.104
-Why didn't you knock?
-I didn't want to wake you.

30:14.146 --> 30:17.191
I've been worried about you.
I called your house many times.

30:17.233 --> 30:19.318
Sit.

30:20.861 --> 30:22.238
What happened?

30:22.279 --> 30:24.114
These people came to us.

30:24.156 --> 30:25.908
These gangsters.

30:25.950 --> 30:28.118
We made a deal with them
to use our store.

30:28.160 --> 30:30.538
For what?

30:30.579 --> 30:31.956
To sell oxy.

30:31.997 --> 30:33.582
-Jose.
-We needed the money.

30:33.624 --> 30:37.461
Pop was gonna have to close
the store down, and...

30:37.503 --> 30:40.089
I'm not judging you.

30:42.341 --> 30:44.301
They call it a pill mill.

30:44.343 --> 30:46.554
We were filling hundreds
of prescriptions a week.

30:46.595 --> 30:49.598
Pop freaked. He wrote a letter
to the medical board.

30:49.640 --> 30:51.559
They found out, the gangsters.

30:51.600 --> 30:53.561
They threatened us.

30:55.479 --> 31:00.150
That morning,
I was at the store.

31:00.192 --> 31:02.987
I left to run an errand.

31:03.028 --> 31:05.239
And while I was gone...

31:11.453 --> 31:13.080
You should go to the police.

31:13.122 --> 31:15.416
-And say what?
-You could identify them.

31:15.457 --> 31:17.710
I don't know who they are.
I didn't see it happen.

31:17.751 --> 31:20.045
I wasn't there. And the news
says the killers wore masks.

31:20.087 --> 31:22.089
And I could go to jail
for fraud.

31:22.131 --> 31:24.842
So they're after you, too.

31:24.883 --> 31:27.761
-Professor.
-Uh-huh?

31:27.803 --> 31:29.138
I need your help.

31:30.389 --> 31:32.182
Of course.

31:32.224 --> 31:34.101
Thank you.

31:36.604 --> 31:38.897
Have you made arrangements?

31:38.939 --> 31:40.482
Arrangements?

31:40.524 --> 31:43.319
For the funeral.
Your father's funeral.

31:50.159 --> 31:53.078
BARREL:
CAPs. Fucking CAPs.

31:53.120 --> 31:55.581
How the mighty have fallen.

31:55.623 --> 31:57.958
It's a temporary assignment.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.961
-Bullshit.
-Respectfully.

32:01.003 --> 32:02.838
Powers and Rodriguez?

32:02.880 --> 32:05.090
Oh, they're gonna get dinged
a couple of days, too.

32:05.132 --> 32:07.426
-It's only fair.
-Fair?

32:07.468 --> 32:08.761
What's fair about it?

32:08.802 --> 32:10.929
All the cases we've closed, L.T.

32:10.971 --> 32:12.348
The-the good work we've done.

32:12.389 --> 32:14.266
-No, I know.
-BARREL: This isn't you.

32:14.308 --> 32:16.310
This is Captain fucking Cooper.

32:16.352 --> 32:19.563
Look, it's Division Command.
It's-it's all of us.

32:21.231 --> 32:24.443
Jumped On cases?
A bunch of he said, she said?

32:24.485 --> 32:26.904
No. Fuck that.

32:26.945 --> 32:28.405
I'll eat my gun first.

32:28.447 --> 32:29.990
Barrel.

32:32.326 --> 32:33.744
He wouldn't actually
do that, would he?

32:33.786 --> 32:35.496
Nah.

32:35.537 --> 32:36.997
Uh, excuse me, Lieutenant.

32:37.039 --> 32:39.500
(Crate clears his throat)

32:40.959 --> 32:42.378
(door shuts)

32:47.466 --> 32:48.842
-Where you going?
-Out.

32:48.884 --> 32:51.011
Maybe you should
give me your piece.

32:51.053 --> 32:52.638
Don't be a cheese dick.

32:56.642 --> 32:58.060
-Hey.
-How'd it go?

32:58.102 --> 32:59.687
All three shots were lethal.

32:59.728 --> 33:01.855
Ballistics is checking them
against the slug

33:01.897 --> 33:03.482
from the Fagan murder.

33:03.524 --> 33:05.484
I meant, how did
your first autopsy go?

33:05.526 --> 33:08.028
(chuckles)
Um, I didn't embarrass myself.

33:08.070 --> 33:10.114
-I didn't think you would.
-I wasn't so sure.

33:10.155 --> 33:11.907
They release the body?

33:11.949 --> 33:13.701
This afternoon.

33:13.742 --> 33:15.953
There'll be a funeral
in the next couple days.

33:15.994 --> 33:18.956
And the son might show up
to pay his last respects.

33:18.997 --> 33:20.791
-Right.
-I'll call the coroner.

33:20.833 --> 33:23.127
Find out the funeral home.

33:23.168 --> 33:25.087
And when and where
the church service is.

33:25.129 --> 33:26.422
And the cemetery.

33:32.219 --> 33:34.304
No evidence of any contact
between the two.

33:34.346 --> 33:37.099
Borders has been in the Q
for the last 20 years

33:37.141 --> 33:38.392
since his conviction.

33:38.434 --> 33:40.686
Olmer bopped around
a little bit.

33:40.728 --> 33:43.564
Folsom, Pelican Bay,
died in Corcoran.

33:43.605 --> 33:46.024
So no intersect there?
Friends, cellmates?

33:46.066 --> 33:47.276
No evidence that they knew

33:47.317 --> 33:48.527
each other
on the outside, either.

33:48.569 --> 33:50.529
You can't prove they didn't.

33:50.571 --> 33:52.156
I can't rule it out.

33:52.197 --> 33:55.075
It was a year and a half
that they were both in L.A.

33:55.117 --> 33:57.536
Four of Olmer's rapes were
in Hollywood during that time.

33:57.578 --> 34:00.539
About a mile or two from where
Danielle Skyler was living.

34:00.581 --> 34:03.083
So Olmer could have done it, or
they could've done it together.

34:03.125 --> 34:05.002
Could have. Didn't.

34:05.043 --> 34:06.628
Would explain the DNA.

34:06.670 --> 34:09.089
DNA was planted.
That's what we have to explain.

34:09.131 --> 34:11.216
What's in it for Olmer?

34:11.258 --> 34:12.843
Dying man, nothing to lose.

34:12.885 --> 34:14.595
Maybe the lawyer
promised him something.

34:14.636 --> 34:16.430
We need to have a look
at his confession.

34:16.472 --> 34:17.931
I'm on it.

34:17.973 --> 34:19.516
What about Borders' phone calls?

34:19.558 --> 34:21.518
Halfway through 'em.

34:21.560 --> 34:25.022
There's a bunch, all to a woman
named Rita Tedesco.

34:25.063 --> 34:26.440
Did a public search.

34:26.482 --> 34:28.650
She's here in L.A.,
but the headline is:

34:28.692 --> 34:32.070
16 years ago,
her and Borders tied the knot.

34:33.113 --> 34:34.323
He's married?

34:34.364 --> 34:36.200
Women who fall for convicts.

34:36.241 --> 34:38.368
-Huh. It's a mystery.
-It's a fetish.

34:38.410 --> 34:41.497
Personality disorder,
hybristophilia.

34:41.538 --> 34:44.875
Sexual arousal and attainment
of orgasm facilitated by

34:44.917 --> 34:47.419
and contingent upon
being with a partner

34:47.461 --> 34:50.464
who has committed
a public outrage.

34:50.506 --> 34:52.508
Rape, murder, armed robbery.

34:52.549 --> 34:54.760
You're a dark horse,
coming up with that one.

34:54.802 --> 34:56.220
It's how I met my first wife.

34:56.261 --> 34:58.013
-Hector.
-What was your outrage?

34:58.055 --> 34:59.515
Could we stay
on point here, please?

35:02.100 --> 35:04.478
About six months ago,
Tedesco and Borders

35:04.520 --> 35:07.064
started communicating in code.

35:07.105 --> 35:09.066
Nothing genius, just,

35:09.107 --> 35:11.068
"Hey, did you talk to that guy

35:11.109 --> 35:13.070
about that thing?"

35:13.111 --> 35:15.113
Nothing specific, no names.

35:15.155 --> 35:17.074
No calls to Olmer's
lawyer or Cronyn?

35:17.115 --> 35:18.659
Just her.

35:18.700 --> 35:21.411
Maybe she's the conduit
between Borders and Cronyn.

35:21.453 --> 35:23.497
Somebody fed Olmer that story.

35:23.539 --> 35:25.415
He didn't come up
with that on his own.

35:25.457 --> 35:27.584
I think we need to know
more about Mrs. Borders.

35:27.626 --> 35:29.086
Yeah, I'm on it.

35:31.588 --> 35:34.466
I know it's strange for you
to be the client

35:34.508 --> 35:37.052
and you're not used
to sitting on your hands,

35:37.094 --> 35:38.554
but you have to trust us.

35:38.595 --> 35:40.889
I will need you
when the time is right.

35:45.936 --> 35:47.771
Bonner.

35:48.814 --> 35:49.857
I know.

35:49.898 --> 35:51.775
You don't like me.

35:51.817 --> 35:53.902
I don't know you well enough
to dislike you.

35:53.944 --> 35:56.572
I worked for Honey Chandler
a long time,

35:56.613 --> 35:59.116
and I've helped her win
a lot of cases.

35:59.157 --> 36:01.827
Let me be clear--
if she's happy...

36:01.869 --> 36:03.829
I don't give a shit
what you think.

36:05.247 --> 36:07.457
I know it was you
that dug up that dirt

36:07.499 --> 36:09.459
on my mother she used
at the Flores trial.

36:09.501 --> 36:12.212
-Is that a problem for you?
-Had I known at the time,

36:12.254 --> 36:14.172
it would have been
a big fucking problem for you.

36:14.214 --> 36:16.383
Just be as good at this
as you were at that.

36:34.860 --> 36:37.029
Heard a lot about you.

36:37.070 --> 36:38.488
And you asked
to work here anyway?

36:38.530 --> 36:40.616
-(scoffs)
-Detective Bosch is a legend.

36:40.657 --> 36:43.160
He does what the rest of us
only wish we could do.

36:43.201 --> 36:44.578
Like what?

36:44.620 --> 36:46.330
Lieutenant Pounds comes to mind.

36:46.371 --> 36:48.206
Oh, that's not my finest hour.

36:48.248 --> 36:49.625
(scoffs) It was for me.

36:49.666 --> 36:51.001
-I worked for the prick.
-(chuckles)

36:51.043 --> 36:52.836
Welcome to Hollywood Homicide.

36:53.962 --> 36:55.714
Here we go.

36:55.756 --> 36:57.090
Jerry, get a look at this.

37:00.928 --> 37:03.347
That's the van driver
from the Garcia Pain Clinic.

37:03.388 --> 37:04.723
Maybe one of the shooters.

37:04.765 --> 37:06.558
We're working on an I.D.

37:07.935 --> 37:09.645
What you got there?

37:09.686 --> 37:11.980
Med Board workup
on the Pain Clinic's patients.

37:12.022 --> 37:14.524
Fair number of these are seeing
doctors at the VA, too.

37:14.566 --> 37:16.151
Double-dipping.

37:16.193 --> 37:17.444
-Hey, Harry.
-Yeah?

37:17.486 --> 37:19.321
Young woman at the front
asking for you.

37:19.363 --> 37:21.323
Says it's about
the Borders case.

37:21.365 --> 37:22.950
Does she have a name?

37:22.991 --> 37:26.244
Dinah Rousseau. Says you know
her by her maiden name.

37:26.286 --> 37:28.455
-Send her back.
-All right.

37:30.499 --> 37:33.877
My mother got this notice from
the district attorney's office.

37:40.133 --> 37:41.677
Is it true?

37:42.719 --> 37:44.596
They're looking into it.

37:44.638 --> 37:46.640
I don't understand.

37:46.682 --> 37:48.850
So, Borders is innocent?

37:48.892 --> 37:50.852
Someone else killed Danielle?

37:50.894 --> 37:52.729
No, it's a mistake.

37:52.771 --> 37:54.731
We'll put a stop to it
at the hearing.

37:56.191 --> 37:58.568
He was supposed
to die in prison.

37:58.610 --> 38:00.195
Life without parole.

38:00.237 --> 38:02.864
You said so.

38:02.906 --> 38:05.409
-You promised.
-I know I did.

38:05.450 --> 38:07.285
And he will.

38:18.839 --> 38:20.298
Mr. Cronyn.

38:22.676 --> 38:24.261
Detective.

38:24.302 --> 38:26.263
Preston Borders is playing you.

38:26.304 --> 38:27.681
He's spent the last
20 years scheming

38:27.723 --> 38:29.641
how to game the system,
and you fell for it.

38:29.683 --> 38:31.518
-I'll get the bailiff.
-You do that.

38:31.560 --> 38:33.520
No, Kathy. It's all right.

38:33.562 --> 38:34.938
I'll be right in.

38:39.109 --> 38:40.944
For the last 20 years,
Preston Borders

38:40.986 --> 38:42.696
has maintained his innocence.

38:42.738 --> 38:45.073
And now evidence has
come to light that proves it.

38:45.115 --> 38:48.118
Her sister came to see me
this morning.

38:48.160 --> 38:49.870
Imagine how she feels.

38:49.911 --> 38:52.372
The Skyler family, most of all,
deserves to know the truth.

38:52.414 --> 38:54.041
They already know it,
and so do I.

38:54.082 --> 38:55.584
What I don't know...

38:55.625 --> 38:57.878
is how Borders
managed this scam.

38:57.919 --> 38:59.838
But I will find out.

38:59.880 --> 39:03.216
And if you're in on it...
you're going down, too.

39:21.318 --> 39:22.569
Thank you.

39:38.585 --> 39:40.253
I'm so sorry, Pop.

39:41.880 --> 39:43.673
I'm so, so sorry.

39:55.227 --> 39:56.728
(horse neighing)

39:56.770 --> 39:58.313
BOSCH:
Dr. Garcia.

39:58.355 --> 39:59.773
What do you think?

39:59.815 --> 40:01.358
Throw him the rap?

40:01.399 --> 40:04.444
BOSCH: No, he lawyers up,
shuts down the clinic,

40:04.486 --> 40:05.737
we got nothing.

40:05.779 --> 40:07.405
What about the VA?

40:07.447 --> 40:09.157
Could be legit.

40:09.199 --> 40:12.619
They get one from the VA,
then go to Garcia for seconds.

40:12.661 --> 40:15.997
-I'm a vet.
-I know you are.

40:16.039 --> 40:17.999
I could get a scrip.

40:18.041 --> 40:20.127
Maybe a line to Garcia.

40:20.168 --> 40:22.838
My back's been killing me,
lifting these evidence boxes.

40:22.879 --> 40:24.297
It's worth a shot.

40:26.716 --> 40:28.260
(engine starts)

40:35.684 --> 40:37.394
Sorry about your CI.

40:37.435 --> 40:38.728
Thanks.

40:38.770 --> 40:40.313
What happened?

40:40.355 --> 40:43.024
I think someone saw him talking
to Marcos and Arias.

40:44.067 --> 40:45.485
Snitch jacket.

40:46.820 --> 40:49.948
Thing is, I put them together.

40:49.990 --> 40:51.449
At their request.

40:51.491 --> 40:52.909
Still.

40:52.951 --> 40:54.953
(cell phone ringing)

40:57.247 --> 40:58.456
Chandler?

40:58.498 --> 41:00.041
I'm at the courthouse,

41:00.083 --> 41:02.752
where you are the trending
topic of conversation.

41:02.794 --> 41:05.046
-Cronyn complain?
-To the judge.

41:05.088 --> 41:06.756
Said you tried
to intimidate him.

41:06.798 --> 41:08.758
Just a warning shot
across the bow.

41:08.800 --> 41:11.344
Something I learned from you.

41:11.386 --> 41:13.847
Well, too bad you didn't acquire
my delicate touch.

41:13.889 --> 41:15.056
My finesse.

41:15.098 --> 41:16.892
You are the master.

41:16.933 --> 41:18.518
Don't you forget it.

41:18.560 --> 41:21.188
I was able to get a quick look
at the case file.

41:21.229 --> 41:22.731
How?

41:22.772 --> 41:25.192
Hector. Told you he was good.

41:25.233 --> 41:27.861
I'm sending you a pdf
of Olmer's confession.

41:27.903 --> 41:29.988
Let me know how it lines up
with the facts.

41:30.030 --> 41:31.489
Will do.

41:35.577 --> 41:37.829
ARMANDO:
Closed, under the circumstances.

41:37.871 --> 41:39.080
FUNERAL DIRECTOR:
Of course.

41:39.122 --> 41:40.332
Visitation?

41:40.373 --> 41:42.083
ARMANDO:
Yes.

41:42.125 --> 41:44.252
He was well respected
in the community.

41:44.294 --> 41:46.671
Very well liked.

41:46.713 --> 41:50.091
FUNERAL DIRECTOR:
Okay. Jose needs to sign these.

41:51.509 --> 41:54.012
Jose, they need you
to sign some papers.
