03:15.363 --> 03:17.448
Why haven't you ever asked me

03:17.657 --> 03:19.993
what is this film about?

03:25.456 --> 03:28.543
And why haven't I ever told you, anyway?

03:34.716 --> 03:37.844
Was it just you not being curious?

03:41.848 --> 03:44.642
Or also me being relieved

03:44.934 --> 03:46.311
you don't ask?

03:52.442 --> 03:55.862
Was it our silent, comfortable agreement

03:56.070 --> 03:58.031
not to talk about it?

05:47.473 --> 05:49.976
Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?

05:57.233 --> 05:58.026
Why?

06:00.737 --> 06:02.196
You need to talk?

06:05.908 --> 06:07.869
I wanted to know you a bit better

06:13.249 --> 06:14.167
You don't have to tell me

06:14.375 --> 06:15.918
anything you don't want to.

06:20.548 --> 06:21.424
OK.

06:25.595 --> 06:26.888
The words on your body,

06:27.388 --> 06:28.431
did you write them?

06:32.143 --> 06:32.977
No

06:33.436 --> 06:34.854
It's part of a book

06:37.732 --> 06:39.275
What language is it in?

06:42.236 --> 06:43.321
Bulgarian

06:48.910 --> 06:50.745
Can you explain to me what it says?

06:59.712 --> 07:01.756
It's a really personal tattoo.

08:57.413 --> 08:59.874
I feel that I really...

09:00.082 --> 09:01.792
I take risks

09:03.377 --> 09:06.589
90% of me wants to hide.

09:08.841 --> 09:12.261
But the 10%, which is smaller,

09:14.263 --> 09:16.265
is strong enough for me to be here

09:20.811 --> 09:23.439
Well, I tell you, when you want to hide 90%,

09:23.648 --> 09:25.858
you go through a lot of shit when filming

09:26.067 --> 09:29.820
For me it's a.

09:33.282 --> 09:35.743
It's a real challenge each time

09:37.495 --> 09:39.247
It's excruciating.

09:50.091 --> 09:53.886
Laura, I'm trying to understand, why am I doing

09:55.012 --> 09:57.014
this kind of research

09:58.849 --> 10:00.601
and what am I looking for,

10:01.060 --> 10:02.895
why am I in your bedroom?

10:04.480 --> 10:08.526
And I feel I still haven't managed to express

10:09.110 --> 10:10.528
why I am here.

10:15.658 --> 10:19.328
I think because it's not in the words area

10:22.915 --> 10:24.417
It comes from

10:25.293 --> 10:26.544
earlier on.

10:28.379 --> 10:29.839
Before words?

10:31.799 --> 10:34.010
Sometimes I have access to that

10:34.427 --> 10:35.553
in my dreams.

10:55.114 --> 10:58.326
Let's just stay in silence for a while.

11:00.995 --> 11:02.538
Take a deep breath in.

11:09.962 --> 11:12.548
Try to synchronize your breathing

11:12.757 --> 11:14.717
with the breathing of your partner

11:18.929 --> 11:21.223
And then open your eyes and just

11:23.517 --> 11:24.977
look at each other.

11:28.272 --> 11:31.734
Enjoy a moment of eye contact.

11:53.631 --> 11:55.800
Be aware of your breathing

12:09.689 --> 12:12.274
Breathe into your fingertips for a moment.

12:12.483 --> 12:14.944
Send all your energy to your fingertips.

12:22.993 --> 12:27.164
And softly start to use your fingers to explore

12:27.373 --> 12:29.417
the face of your partner

12:36.382 --> 12:39.635
Try to imagine how the face looks,

12:40.010 --> 12:41.637
just with your fingers.

12:47.435 --> 12:50.730
Just like every fingertip is a little eye

12:51.021 --> 12:53.733
exploring this new landscape.

13:09.999 --> 13:13.586
When you're ready to explore new territory,

13:14.170 --> 13:16.088
then go to the nose,

13:20.760 --> 13:22.762
the sides of the mouth.

13:32.146 --> 13:33.397
Take your time.

13:44.033 --> 13:46.702
Then, very slowly,

13:47.953 --> 13:49.622
lift off your hands

13:50.247 --> 13:51.624
No

13:51.832 --> 13:53.083
No

13:56.504 --> 13:59.340
Slowly come back to yourself.

14:10.935 --> 14:12.812
Tomas and Christian,

14:16.357 --> 14:20.110
can you describe what you feel in this journey?

14:23.739 --> 14:27.243
I went through this roller coaster, up and down,

14:27.451 --> 14:29.203
with all the emotions

14:30.496 --> 14:33.916
And I tried to find a point in your eyes

14:34.124 --> 14:38.045
where I could really see into your soul.

14:38.712 --> 14:42.675
But I had a bit of trouble seeing that

14:46.554 --> 14:48.013
I also noticed

14:48.222 --> 14:51.767
there is some coverage

14:52.977 --> 14:57.773
I mean, it felt like there is some cover over...

14:58.524 --> 15:01.944
If I envisaged your soul

15:02.152 --> 15:04.238
as a proper object,

15:04.446 --> 15:06.907
then I would say there is a cover

15:07.116 --> 15:09.201
or a blanket over it.

15:09.410 --> 15:11.787
I don't know how to interpret that,

15:11.996 --> 15:15.124
or how I could really notice that or so

15:15.332 --> 15:18.377
Or if it was just an impression in my head

15:25.342 --> 15:26.635
I hope I don't...

15:27.094 --> 15:29.847
I don't hurt you when I say something like that

15:31.181 --> 15:33.684
Tomas, how was it for you?

15:43.777 --> 15:45.821
It's a very intimate part of the body.

15:46.030 --> 15:47.072
The face..

15:48.115 --> 15:49.617
It's not..

15:53.662 --> 15:56.749
It's not very easy. But it's.

15:59.627 --> 16:00.711
I don't know.

16:02.379 --> 16:03.672
It becomes so intimate,

16:04.048 --> 16:07.843
it's like you're falling from a cliff

16:17.353 --> 16:19.188
I don't know what to say.

16:21.065 --> 16:22.733
It's both good and frightening

16:22.942 --> 16:25.110
to go into this zone,

16:26.612 --> 16:28.697
more than any other part of the body.

16:29.031 --> 16:32.076
The face is something very personal

16:33.118 --> 16:35.829
Normally you don't let anyone into this space.

16:36.038 --> 16:38.499
What did you feel when you touched his face?

16:43.879 --> 16:47.758
It was not that easy around the mouth for me

16:50.052 --> 16:54.556
It was more challenging there

16:59.895 --> 17:02.064
Body fluids like saliva,

17:03.565 --> 17:05.358
it's something very.

17:07.069 --> 17:09.905
You're not used to get in
contact with that, necessarily.

17:14.617 --> 17:16.954
It's not so easy to be so direct for me.

17:17.162 --> 17:20.708
Normally I don't say things like this.

17:21.333 --> 17:22.876
So directly.

17:24.586 --> 17:27.923
It's good. I'm totally fine with that.

17:29.800 --> 17:31.593
I enjoy the feedback

17:38.100 --> 17:40.394
What feelings did this bring up?

17:46.567 --> 17:47.943
It's..

17:49.570 --> 17:50.946
It's..

17:54.033 --> 17:55.200
... rejection.

17:57.870 --> 18:00.330
It's overwhelming, it's just.

18:01.665 --> 18:03.042
You wanna leave.

18:04.251 --> 18:07.671
When there is something overwhelming, you just.

18:08.297 --> 18:10.215
You don't want to be where you are

20:06.540 --> 20:07.833
More salt?

20:47.206 --> 20:49.124
Suppose you are the man.

20:50.667 --> 20:53.212
You are the cello, of course.

20:54.129 --> 20:55.422
And me...

20:56.381 --> 20:57.507
I'm the piano.

20:57.716 --> 20:59.968
I'm playing around you,

21:00.177 --> 21:02.512
I'm embedding you,

21:02.721 --> 21:05.182
I'm helping you

21:06.725 --> 21:08.518
to play with strength

21:10.771 --> 21:12.731
A really great piece of music

21:14.316 --> 21:15.567
Well..

21:19.446 --> 21:21.156
Maybe I'm not cheap,

21:22.699 --> 21:24.201
but I think

21:25.744 --> 21:28.956
I'm worth every dollar or every euro

21:29.790 --> 21:31.166
you pay for me.

21:36.964 --> 21:39.758
A possible outfit for "De Luxus Hanna"

21:46.807 --> 21:49.142
Just listen to the wonderful music

21:54.356 --> 21:56.608
Would you tell me a little bit about your desires?

21:56.817 --> 21:59.194
Or it is too early?

22:12.541 --> 22:15.836
And how did you find my telephone number?

22:16.044 --> 22:19.047
On my internet site, I remember?

22:19.256 --> 22:20.632
- Yes.
- OK

22:20.966 --> 22:23.510
And you watched the site, I think?

22:25.512 --> 22:27.931
What is interesting?

22:28.140 --> 22:29.891
What interest would you have

22:30.475 --> 22:33.437
in my person especially?

22:35.814 --> 22:37.232
I think it's a bit.

22:41.445 --> 22:46.825
I think it's a bit confused. I'm a bit confused.

22:47.075 --> 22:49.786
- You have been confused?
- I am very confused

22:49.995 --> 22:54.374
- Too many people in one person?
- No I mean..

22:55.834 --> 22:59.046
In one of the videos I saw,

22:59.504 --> 23:01.923
there was something very comfortable about you.

23:02.132 --> 23:03.050
OK.

23:04.926 --> 23:07.179
I'm a little bit influenced by my father,

23:07.387 --> 23:09.181
who was a piano player.

23:09.639 --> 23:11.767
And he studied in Munich, and so on

23:13.518 --> 23:15.270
He played classical,

23:15.729 --> 23:17.731
and it was a great impression to me

23:17.939 --> 23:23.028
to just hear him playing music

23:23.236 --> 23:26.073
when I got to sleep as a child.

23:27.032 --> 23:30.202
There were no children's songs.

23:30.410 --> 23:32.913
There was Chopin, there was Beethoven

23:34.414 --> 23:35.832
Something like this.

23:36.541 --> 23:37.626
Well,

23:38.043 --> 23:42.130
so I got accustomed to that sort of music and...

23:45.300 --> 23:49.513
Where do you have your music, around here?

23:50.889 --> 23:52.140
Down here.

23:55.894 --> 23:57.396
Would you like to choose?

24:02.776 --> 24:04.986
My father liked Brahms very much.

24:07.489 --> 24:09.658
It's a sort of melancholic music

24:12.661 --> 24:14.746
Just hear a little bit

24:15.163 --> 24:17.707
Sit down. Why so shy?

24:38.061 --> 24:39.020
What do you feel now?

24:39.229 --> 24:42.441
It's a little bit more distance or less distance?

24:42.649 --> 24:44.443
- With you, you mean?
- Yes

24:45.235 --> 24:46.319
I feel more comfortable,

24:46.528 --> 24:49.489
- but I don't want you to get too close.
- OK

24:50.031 --> 24:51.366
It's too close for you?

24:52.200 --> 24:53.243
A bit.

24:53.452 --> 24:55.829
OK. No problem.

24:58.373 --> 25:01.460
- But I can take off my shoes.
- OK

25:07.424 --> 25:09.593
I like them and I hate them.

25:13.555 --> 25:15.223
Would you tell me a little bit more

25:15.807 --> 25:18.101
about this call boy?

25:18.768 --> 25:20.061
And what you did.

25:20.645 --> 25:22.355
The nothing you did?

25:28.904 --> 25:33.325
So, this young man comes around,

25:34.576 --> 25:36.453
and we have this ritual.

25:41.875 --> 25:44.294
If you tell me that you watch people,

25:45.754 --> 25:49.424
this young guy getting undressed for instance,

25:50.592 --> 25:52.928
I could do the same with you.

25:53.261 --> 25:55.347
There are kinds of prostitution.

25:55.639 --> 25:58.183
For instance, you can be a call boy,

25:58.475 --> 26:01.645
going to the apartment of people,

26:01.853 --> 26:03.438
you can be in a brothel,

26:03.980 --> 26:05.774
you can be on the street.

26:07.651 --> 26:09.653
I've done all these things.

26:09.861 --> 26:12.239
But what I never have done

26:12.572 --> 26:17.577
is having been member of a peep show

26:19.246 --> 26:23.792
And this I would like to do.

26:26.378 --> 26:27.295
In a certain sense,

26:27.504 --> 26:30.799
you would fulfill a desire of mine,

26:31.508 --> 26:33.969
just playing peep show for you

26:36.846 --> 26:38.306
There are many men

26:39.432 --> 26:41.226
just dropping the coins,

26:42.727 --> 26:44.062
nothing else.

26:45.230 --> 26:48.024
Maybe a man in this direction opens this window,

26:48.233 --> 26:50.694
opens this window, opens this window.

28:48.103 --> 28:49.938
This is the whole truth.

28:56.319 --> 28:57.779
What about the breasts?

29:02.701 --> 29:03.785
The nipples

29:05.870 --> 29:07.497
standing a little bit

29:09.833 --> 29:12.919
Touch them. You can even spit a little bit,

29:17.799 --> 29:20.176
so it goes a little bit more smoothly

29:21.678 --> 29:23.763
I think my penis is my clit,

29:24.264 --> 29:26.433
clitoris. It's the same.

29:26.850 --> 29:30.353
Also you can manipulate it the same.

29:31.146 --> 29:33.940
I do not do it like the men do it.

29:35.191 --> 29:37.152
I just do it, I'll show you,

29:37.360 --> 29:39.154
more like a woman does it

29:40.196 --> 29:41.239
See?

29:50.165 --> 29:52.584
Now Laura, how do you feel?

29:54.794 --> 29:56.296
What about your body?

30:10.185 --> 30:11.978
I live with my body every day.

30:14.773 --> 30:16.649
But I suppose I don't really know it.

30:21.362 --> 30:23.406
Apart from the varicose veins,

30:24.282 --> 30:24.908
the scar

30:25.116 --> 30:26.451
You know, when she asked me:

30:27.535 --> 30:28.953
Talk to me about your body or.

30:29.162 --> 30:32.123
You know, I didn't have anything to say

30:37.462 --> 30:39.631
In my perception, you are your body,

30:40.673 --> 30:41.925
in this moment.

30:43.802 --> 30:45.762
And you are talking about your body

30:46.429 --> 30:48.097
as about a stranger

30:55.772 --> 30:57.315
It's kind of questioning.

31:00.026 --> 31:01.361
You know, when Hanna

31:02.946 --> 31:05.406
became, or chose to become a female,

31:06.366 --> 31:08.368
she was 50, she was about my age

31:08.576 --> 31:12.997
And I think it's an age where you start thinking:

31:13.206 --> 31:14.791
OK, I've got another...

31:16.543 --> 31:18.294
.. let's say 15 to 20 years

31:18.503 --> 31:20.213
of hopefully being in good health.

31:21.339 --> 31:24.384
Do I want to continue the way I'm living now?

32:33.077 --> 32:34.621
- It's something you can't control.
- Yes.

32:34.829 --> 32:36.497
It's totally bad

32:37.373 --> 32:41.336
I wouldn't say that there is good and bad

32:42.003 --> 32:43.963
I mean, for you it was distracting,

32:44.172 --> 32:46.841
and you had the impulse to go away.

32:47.091 --> 32:48.635
But it's not bad

32:48.843 --> 32:51.638
It's just something you experienced

32:53.306 --> 32:55.850
And you can go into that emotion

32:56.059 --> 32:59.270
and feel how it feels to have that emotion,

32:59.938 --> 33:03.691
wanting to go away Really experience that.

33:11.908 --> 33:14.369
Did you have long hair at some stage?

33:15.328 --> 33:17.038
Yes, until I was 13

33:19.374 --> 33:21.834
Did you decide to take it away?

33:22.085 --> 33:24.545
No, it's natural, I lost all my hair

33:24.754 --> 33:27.215
Oh, I didn't know that. How was it?

33:27.966 --> 33:30.927
It was pretty hard then, when you're 13

33:31.344 --> 33:33.304
I can imagine

33:34.681 --> 33:37.976
When you are young, you are very vulnerable,

33:38.768 --> 33:42.063
you want to have contacts with girls, and so on

33:42.981 --> 33:46.025
It's not easy to be different, I guess.

33:46.234 --> 33:46.985
No

33:48.736 --> 33:51.906
How did you manage to cope? How did you.

33:53.950 --> 33:56.035
I just hold all my emotions inside.

33:56.244 --> 33:59.038
I never cried, I never did anything. I just...

33:59.455 --> 34:01.749
- That must be hard.
- Yes.

34:04.794 --> 34:07.463
And you, being different?

34:10.507 --> 34:13.386
In my childhood I had one experience,

34:13.594 --> 34:17.056
that I was in physiotherapy,

34:17.264 --> 34:20.643
and I was talking to my therapist,

34:20.851 --> 34:23.771
and I was mentioning

34:23.980 --> 34:28.150
that sometimes I feel that.

34:29.318 --> 34:32.989
I'm a brain being carried around

34:33.989 --> 34:36.034
without any body

34:37.784 --> 34:41.706
And that was the state of my mind

34:42.498 --> 34:45.501
until I really came in touch

34:45.710 --> 34:49.714
with the pleasure of sexuality.

36:58.926 --> 37:00.428
I can feel your heart

37:05.933 --> 37:08.936
You had cold hands, and now they are warming up

37:14.859 --> 37:16.194
Scars.

37:16.402 --> 37:17.778
I have a scar,

37:18.988 --> 37:19.906
here.

37:24.702 --> 37:27.330
Your belly button is different than mine.

37:29.957 --> 37:31.667
This is a funny part

37:34.003 --> 37:36.297
- Inexplicable.
- Yes.

37:37.381 --> 37:39.091
An old connection.

37:44.847 --> 37:46.766
What color was your hair?

37:47.475 --> 37:48.726
Blondish.

37:52.855 --> 37:54.774
It was tough for me then

37:57.985 --> 38:00.821
I went from being the cute boy to the weird.

38:04.867 --> 38:07.245
I was always wearing a hat, hiding

38:12.959 --> 38:14.752
And how do you feel now?

38:16.671 --> 38:18.589
You feel comfortable in your skin?

38:18.798 --> 38:19.715
Yes.

38:21.592 --> 38:23.552
It's been more than half of my life

38:24.887 --> 38:27.807
If I had a choice, I wouldn't choose hair today.

38:30.810 --> 38:33.187
In a way, it's also one mask less.

38:36.232 --> 38:38.567
We are always hiding behind many masks,

38:38.776 --> 38:40.736
and hair is one mask.

38:41.904 --> 38:44.657
And it's like being more naked like that now

38:46.993 --> 38:48.995
And I have a lot of hair

38:51.998 --> 38:53.749
It's in my genes

38:57.712 --> 39:00.298
I used to be very embarrassed when I was little

39:01.590 --> 39:03.009
that I had hair on my.

39:03.384 --> 39:04.051
Your hands?

39:04.260 --> 39:05.136
... on my hands

39:05.344 --> 39:09.807
And because I'm very dark, with pale skin

39:10.391 --> 39:12.101
And you can see everything

40:19.752 --> 40:21.670
I spent my whole childhood

40:21.879 --> 40:23.714
being told what to do.

40:28.010 --> 40:29.595
And I did think, when I grew up,

40:29.804 --> 40:33.891
I thought there's gonna be this miracle age: 18

40:34.975 --> 40:37.728
And when you wake up on your 18th birthday,

40:38.562 --> 40:40.106
it's all changed.

40:40.815 --> 40:41.857
Freedom

40:42.942 --> 40:44.026
is there

40:45.611 --> 40:47.279
What a disappointment.

40:51.700 --> 40:53.661
It's very innocent.

40:59.291 --> 41:00.835
But freedom.

41:03.963 --> 41:05.381
... is a hell of a.

41:08.634 --> 41:09.635
.. quest.

41:15.182 --> 41:16.642
Isn't it?

41:27.570 --> 41:28.988
Freedom fighters.

41:50.050 --> 41:51.886
I could give you a few options

41:52.553 --> 41:55.014
and you can say: That's what I need.

41:56.348 --> 41:58.434
Let's start with something I think you don't need,

41:58.642 --> 42:01.312
so you see what I feel like How does that feel?

42:04.398 --> 42:07.026
Some clients need a boyfriend experience

42:07.693 --> 42:10.070
They want to feel cozy and loved

42:10.279 --> 42:12.531
and have a snuggle for several hours,

42:13.115 --> 42:15.284
and just sort of feel that closeness

42:16.160 --> 42:18.454
I think you probably don't need that right now,

42:18.662 --> 42:20.206
but you'll probably need that another time

42:20.414 --> 42:21.624
Some people like to surrender,

42:21.832 --> 42:23.709
being physically overpowered

42:24.502 --> 42:26.086
Holding your wrists,

42:27.129 --> 42:28.589
holding you down,

42:29.089 --> 42:32.718
and sort of being ripped asunder emotionally.

42:32.927 --> 42:34.553
So whatever is knocking at the door,

42:34.887 --> 42:36.388
I burst that door down,

42:37.806 --> 42:39.517
and let it come out.

42:39.725 --> 42:40.809
So I force my way in,

42:41.018 --> 42:43.521
but within consent I force my way in

42:46.315 --> 42:48.108
Just by holding your wrist down?

42:48.817 --> 42:50.569
Holding your wrist is a start.

42:50.778 --> 42:54.031
There's also tools like floggers and ropes,

42:54.698 --> 42:58.035
kink, BDSM, role-play

42:58.494 --> 43:00.120
Move your hand towards your heart

43:04.708 --> 43:06.085
You're a strong lass.

43:10.923 --> 43:12.675
That emotion that came out, that "whraa"

43:12.883 --> 43:14.009
that we spoke about earlier,

43:14.218 --> 43:16.387
is a powerful force inside you

43:16.804 --> 43:18.055
The creature behind the door,

43:18.264 --> 43:20.683
your shadow will come out through that "whraa"

43:21.183 --> 43:22.518
It's just one wrist.

43:23.310 --> 43:24.687
You've got two, of course

43:24.895 --> 43:27.606
And ankles, and clothes,

43:28.023 --> 43:29.817
and thighs

43:35.114 --> 43:36.407
How's that feel?

43:40.327 --> 43:41.912
It feels

43:45.874 --> 43:47.084
powerful.

43:50.045 --> 43:52.339
It doesn't actually scare me.

43:55.259 --> 43:57.469
Behind most people's "whraa",

43:57.678 --> 44:00.264
unreleased "whraa", there's a story

44:00.639 --> 44:03.183
And sometimes that story is really relevant

44:04.351 --> 44:05.978
In terms of the healing process,

44:06.186 --> 44:09.148
telling that story is really a potent thing.

44:09.398 --> 44:11.609
And sometimes, that's not relevant at all.

44:12.693 --> 44:13.777
Do you think with you, it's relevant,

44:13.986 --> 44:15.362
the story that's there?

44:18.240 --> 44:19.825
I honestly.

44:22.828 --> 44:24.455
I honestly don't know.

44:26.498 --> 44:27.666
I don't think

44:29.209 --> 44:30.628
my story is...

44:32.963 --> 44:35.799
There's anything particularly incredible

44:36.008 --> 44:37.551
about my story.

44:39.345 --> 44:40.596
I mean, I don't understand

44:40.804 --> 44:44.099
why I've reached this point because of my story

44:47.645 --> 44:50.272
So, maybe there's something in my story I don't know

44:53.484 --> 44:55.235
Or I don't remember.

44:58.614 --> 45:00.282
I'm gonna touch your hair

45:21.345 --> 45:23.555
All emotion welcome here

45:32.314 --> 45:33.982
This emotion, this shadow,

45:34.233 --> 45:35.984
this thing that's locked inside you.

45:36.193 --> 45:38.195
This is the start of releasing it

45:38.404 --> 45:40.364
This is what you called me for.

45:41.907 --> 45:43.409
I've got the skills to hold you,

45:43.617 --> 45:44.535
as you go through it,

45:44.743 --> 45:46.787
but you're gonna drive at your own pace.

45:47.955 --> 45:49.415
You're feeling safe?

45:50.666 --> 45:52.084
I think so, yeah

45:56.463 --> 45:57.798
There's some good energy inside you,

45:58.006 --> 46:01.093
there's some potent emotion inside that "whraa"

46:04.680 --> 46:05.931
When the door opens,

46:06.849 --> 46:07.850
there's levels of intimacy

46:08.058 --> 46:12.563
that help you feel safe to be emotional

46:13.772 --> 46:15.733
We can also bring that more into your body,

46:17.192 --> 46:22.865
bringing the "whraa" from here, down to here, to here

46:23.198 --> 46:25.951
- OK.
- Would you like to try something like that?

46:29.830 --> 46:31.999
Shall we stand. Shall we go here?

46:35.794 --> 46:37.421
I'm gonna tap you here.

46:39.923 --> 46:41.133
How does that feel?

46:43.510 --> 46:46.054
Look into my eyes. How does that feel?

46:46.263 --> 46:47.306
OK.

46:47.890 --> 46:48.932
If you want harder,

46:50.017 --> 46:51.560
you tell me: harder

46:54.354 --> 46:55.230
Harder.

47:13.207 --> 47:14.750
How does that feel, Laura?

47:18.796 --> 47:20.339
I'm gonna use two hands

47:33.519 --> 47:35.229
I'm gonna shake you a little bit.

47:37.147 --> 47:38.857
This feels like punching down,

47:39.066 --> 47:41.652
breaking down the locked-up temple walls

47:42.528 --> 47:43.654
in here,

47:44.112 --> 47:45.364
letting love in.

47:48.158 --> 47:49.243
How does that feel?

47:54.957 --> 47:56.458
Can I touch your tears?

47:57.918 --> 47:59.670
And there I touch your face.

48:01.630 --> 48:02.840
How's that?

48:03.048 --> 48:04.383
Uncomfortable

48:09.721 --> 48:10.973
I taste your tear.

48:20.941 --> 48:22.734
I have a fetish for tears

48:24.903 --> 48:26.405
You're missing salt.

48:26.613 --> 48:27.656
Maybe

48:35.706 --> 48:37.666
There's that shadow behind the door.

48:37.875 --> 48:39.626
And male sexuality

48:40.335 --> 48:42.838
is one of the things that's keeping it there

48:43.755 --> 48:46.592
It's good to become conscious of that

48:47.509 --> 48:49.011
Think, you're in bed,

48:49.219 --> 48:52.472
or in intimate situations with your lovers,

48:53.223 --> 48:57.019
if this is having this unconscious effect on you,

48:57.227 --> 48:58.103
it also can stop you

48:58.312 --> 49:00.272
from being intimate with people.

49:01.064 --> 49:02.399
But if you can project that out

49:02.608 --> 49:04.526
without breaking your wrists,

49:05.944 --> 49:07.779
there's more chance of intimacy.

49:20.626 --> 49:22.753
What was the word you used yesterday?

49:26.924 --> 49:29.092
When I said revolt, and you said.

49:29.301 --> 49:30.385
Anger.

49:36.224 --> 49:38.393
I wasn't expecting to scream.

49:48.487 --> 49:51.031
And I didn't realize how just a simple

49:52.032 --> 49:54.701
someone holding your wrist,

50:00.540 --> 50:02.376
in a non-aggressive way,

50:02.584 --> 50:08.465
could make me so angry

50:15.597 --> 50:18.850
I think I'm really scared of my anger.

50:48.922 --> 50:50.716
Open your eyes.

50:56.013 --> 50:58.682
And then, very slowly

51:00.017 --> 51:03.103
lift off your hand from your partner's chest.

51:14.573 --> 51:16.992
Slowly come back to yourself.

51:21.121 --> 51:22.456
And breathe

51:36.720 --> 51:40.432
Do we have a towel, or a paper or something?

51:40.640 --> 51:45.145
I think I'm drooling a bit Maybe you can wipe me?

51:48.065 --> 51:50.484
Yes. That's better.

52:02.496 --> 52:04.164
I guess there's one discussion there

52:04.372 --> 52:08.710
that could be. We could give it a try.

52:09.044 --> 52:11.254
- Sure.
- Please feel free

52:13.381 --> 52:14.591
I think I was..

52:16.676 --> 52:17.511
I was brought up.

52:17.719 --> 52:20.972
I think my mother was in a way that she was.

52:22.390 --> 52:23.975
She didn't want to.

52:24.768 --> 52:27.354
She didn't always feel so good when I was a kid

52:27.646 --> 52:31.358
and she didn't want me to feel that she felt bad

52:31.775 --> 52:35.195
So she was always hiding her emotions,

52:35.403 --> 52:38.031
she was always smiling when she was feeling bad.

52:38.406 --> 52:41.576
Like it was a certain message that was:

52:41.785 --> 52:43.703
"You always have to feel good."

52:45.247 --> 52:49.126
And I think I often try to say only good things

52:49.334 --> 52:50.710
Also, when I feel something else,

52:50.919 --> 52:53.755
I just push it away and I'm not allowing myself

52:53.964 --> 52:56.133
to say things that I think

52:56.341 --> 52:57.926
could hurt someone else.

52:59.928 --> 53:02.305
And it's freeing

53:02.514 --> 53:06.309
to be against someone that is not afraid

53:06.518 --> 53:09.479
of talking things straight out

53:09.688 --> 53:11.690
and receiving things and..

53:12.399 --> 53:14.818
... being in a secure space like here,

53:15.986 --> 53:20.740
where I allow myself to talk a bit more openly.

53:23.368 --> 53:24.786
And it's a.

53:27.831 --> 53:30.750
It's so great I'm very grateful for that

53:31.084 --> 53:32.335
Thank you.

53:32.669 --> 53:35.964
It was.. It helped me when you said

53:36.173 --> 53:38.425
that there's no bad nor good.

53:38.633 --> 53:40.760
It's just what it is.

53:41.094 --> 53:45.348
It's not bad to feel something

53:45.557 --> 53:47.475
that you don't like but...

53:47.934 --> 53:49.686
It is like it is.

53:51.396 --> 53:54.441
At some stage I learned,

53:55.233 --> 53:58.069
or I heard, that all this

54:00.363 --> 54:02.949
idea of good and bad

54:03.408 --> 54:05.035
is actually

54:06.870 --> 54:09.372
a thing coming from the Middle Ages,

54:09.789 --> 54:11.583
or from Christianity,

54:12.751 --> 54:15.086
which is quite artificial,

54:16.129 --> 54:19.090
to divide the world into two parts,

54:19.758 --> 54:21.259
good and bad

54:22.719 --> 54:26.306
And that's actually not how the world works

54:27.641 --> 54:29.601
Things are much more complex

54:29.976 --> 54:32.812
than black and white, good and bad.

54:34.731 --> 54:37.150
There's so many shades of everything.

56:22.422 --> 56:24.382
How about we exchange places?

56:27.052 --> 56:28.219
I go there.

56:29.095 --> 56:30.430
And you come here.

57:10.929 --> 57:13.139
This is a really tough place to be

57:15.809 --> 57:16.851
Why?

57:21.106 --> 57:23.650
I think I'm feeling what you must have felt

57:25.527 --> 57:27.779
very often, in this place

57:37.455 --> 57:38.706
What do you feel?

57:42.043 --> 57:43.920
I think it's a lot of fear.

57:50.009 --> 57:51.261
Do you know what of?

58:01.980 --> 58:03.606
Of being looked at.

58:06.901 --> 58:08.403
Of being judged.

58:15.160 --> 58:18.455
And I think the most powerful moment I've seen

58:19.330 --> 58:22.292
was when you touched your anger.

58:23.960 --> 58:26.504
It was something I knew very well.

58:40.435 --> 58:42.145
Did I scream for you?

59:40.662 --> 59:42.580
Just listen to the music.

59:44.499 --> 59:47.001
Just reflect on what you expect from me

59:47.418 --> 59:48.670
How can I help you

01:00:06.396 --> 01:00:08.231
It's very much more light

01:00:09.148 --> 01:00:10.483
It's more easy.

01:00:11.401 --> 01:00:12.277
More..

01:00:14.362 --> 01:00:16.406
- A bit more playful.
- Yes.

01:00:17.740 --> 01:00:19.701
There you see music is a play.

01:00:22.328 --> 01:00:24.831
Also, I think sexuality is a play.

01:00:25.582 --> 01:00:28.543
Just... you ought to take it a little bit easy.

01:00:31.588 --> 01:00:33.464
Well, I'd like to be more relaxed

01:00:34.048 --> 01:00:35.049
OK.

01:00:36.426 --> 01:00:38.469
- I'm relaxed.
- I know

01:00:40.763 --> 01:00:41.931
And I'm not.

01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:44.017
And I wish I were

01:00:44.225 --> 01:00:47.103
OK Just try to do the same as I do

01:00:49.772 --> 01:00:50.732
Literally?

01:00:52.483 --> 01:00:53.651
Lie down and be on a beach.

01:00:53.860 --> 01:00:55.778
Like being in a mirror.

01:00:56.571 --> 01:01:00.742
There is a mirror, there is you, OK.

01:01:10.376 --> 01:01:11.794
It's so quiet.

01:01:16.633 --> 01:01:17.842
Just watch it

01:01:19.636 --> 01:01:21.137
A little bit more lively.

01:01:24.098 --> 01:01:26.476
Four intelligent people just chatting.

01:01:30.980 --> 01:01:32.148
Like birds.

01:01:36.611 --> 01:01:38.946
It's the same Brahms as we heard last time,

01:01:41.115 --> 01:01:44.035
but he was a little bit older here,

01:01:44.619 --> 01:01:46.579
a little bit more relaxed.

01:01:48.623 --> 01:01:49.916
Yes, of course.

01:01:50.124 --> 01:01:53.086
The age of composers is also important.

01:01:56.130 --> 01:01:58.508
So we move a little bit opposite.

01:01:58.716 --> 01:01:59.550
Come.

01:02:00.426 --> 01:02:01.719
It's a mirror.

01:02:02.136 --> 01:02:03.429
I'm your mirror.

01:02:04.180 --> 01:02:06.349
You are my mirror. OK?

01:02:08.393 --> 01:02:10.269
It's really like birds

01:02:10.478 --> 01:02:11.854
I didn't hear this piece of music

01:02:12.063 --> 01:02:13.106
for a long time

01:02:17.026 --> 01:02:19.612
Schumann got seriously ill,

01:02:19.821 --> 01:02:21.072
ill in the brain

01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:22.782
He was transferred to a hospital

01:02:22.990 --> 01:02:25.034
so they could keep him closed in

01:02:25.243 --> 01:02:27.120
He even tried to murder himself.

01:02:27.453 --> 01:02:29.622
And Brahms

01:02:29.831 --> 01:02:34.293
and the young Clara Schumann were alone

01:02:34.585 --> 01:02:36.129
And so they came together

01:02:36.671 --> 01:02:40.550
But Brahms was completely unable

01:02:40.758 --> 01:02:42.719
to practice sexuality

01:02:44.220 --> 01:02:46.431
He couldn't really get close to her

01:02:47.098 --> 01:02:50.143
Because he was such an introverted man.

01:02:50.810 --> 01:02:52.311
And he suffered from his introversion,

01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:55.148
so he put everything in his music

01:02:55.648 --> 01:02:58.568
All his feelings, he put in his music.

01:02:59.902 --> 01:03:00.737
Lucky thing.

01:03:04.365 --> 01:03:06.284
I think with you it's different.

01:03:07.660 --> 01:03:09.662
- Don't you think?
- Different how?

01:03:10.997 --> 01:03:11.873
Well,

01:03:12.999 --> 01:03:14.167
I think.

01:03:16.586 --> 01:03:18.212
It's just my feeling.

01:03:19.505 --> 01:03:22.550
There may be a sort of inhibition.

01:03:23.634 --> 01:03:25.887
But I think we...

01:03:26.304 --> 01:03:28.097
... can overcome it.

01:03:32.435 --> 01:03:36.898
Always presenting something new for my clients.

01:03:40.276 --> 01:03:41.110
So?

01:03:44.697 --> 01:03:45.823
What do you see?

01:03:48.242 --> 01:03:49.952
An imperfect body.

01:03:51.078 --> 01:03:54.373
This belly, very much too fat

01:03:56.751 --> 01:03:59.504
This here, this navel - broken.

01:03:59.712 --> 01:04:02.632
I caught it with this piercing.

01:04:05.009 --> 01:04:07.220
That's OK.

01:04:10.598 --> 01:04:12.517
My breasts. Well...

01:04:13.726 --> 01:04:16.604
I have names for my breasts Have I told you?

01:04:16.813 --> 01:04:18.147
- No.
- No?

01:04:19.023 --> 01:04:20.358
This is Gusti

01:04:20.733 --> 01:04:21.818
- Gusti?
- Gusti

01:04:22.026 --> 01:04:23.110
How do you do?

01:04:23.986 --> 01:04:24.904
I'm fine!

01:04:26.572 --> 01:04:27.865
This is Lilo.

01:04:28.366 --> 01:04:29.617
- Lilo?
- Lilo.

01:04:29.826 --> 01:04:31.577
Why did you choose Gusti and Lilo?

01:04:31.786 --> 01:04:33.746
Well, it was spontaneous

01:04:34.121 --> 01:04:36.874
I always give names spontaneously.

01:04:37.834 --> 01:04:38.709
Yes.

01:04:40.545 --> 01:04:44.340
Gusti is, well, more sensitive, you know?

01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:46.926
And Lilo,

01:04:47.844 --> 01:04:49.971
Lilo had an operation

01:04:51.639 --> 01:04:53.266
Lilo was not there before.

01:04:53.766 --> 01:04:55.977
- And Gusti was?
- Gusti was.

01:04:57.937 --> 01:04:59.856
So, Gusti is the older one also.

01:05:01.023 --> 01:05:02.650
They are sisters, you know?

01:05:06.696 --> 01:05:08.155
I think there is no weird,

01:05:08.364 --> 01:05:10.533
really weird, in sexuality.

01:05:10.741 --> 01:05:13.202
You don't think what? That there's no what?

01:05:13.411 --> 01:05:17.373
I think there's nothing weird in sexuality It's nothing

01:05:19.166 --> 01:05:21.544
There are just things which are dangerous.

01:05:22.461 --> 01:05:25.089
Dangerous for your life and for your health,

01:05:25.298 --> 01:05:27.633
and for your psyche

01:05:28.134 --> 01:05:32.513
And every other thing shouldn't be forbidden.

01:05:34.181 --> 01:05:36.893
It's your way to play this game,

01:05:38.394 --> 01:05:39.896
in my opinion.

01:05:44.984 --> 01:05:47.612
And I think it's fascinating.

01:05:59.457 --> 01:06:01.584
Room tone with rain in the background

01:08:17.886 --> 01:08:20.930
What would you say
is your favorite part of your body?

01:08:24.602 --> 01:08:25.685
I think

01:08:25.853 --> 01:08:29.356
if I need to name one part,

01:08:29.648 --> 01:08:31.274
that would be my eyes,

01:08:32.068 --> 01:08:33.736
I think I have.

01:08:34.694 --> 01:08:37.656
I'm aware I have nice eyes

01:08:38.157 --> 01:08:40.826
Some say that they are beautiful

01:08:42.828 --> 01:08:44.497
and sparkling.

01:08:44.872 --> 01:08:46.749
And I'm proud of that

01:08:48.709 --> 01:08:51.377
I think I can reach people with my eyes,

01:08:52.671 --> 01:08:55.091
and talk to them through my eyes

01:08:56.091 --> 01:08:59.053
Yes, your eyes are very strong, I think

01:08:59.261 --> 01:09:00.679
I noticed that right away.

01:09:02.139 --> 01:09:04.390
But I also like my hair.

01:09:05.184 --> 01:09:06.769
I like my skin

01:09:07.645 --> 01:09:09.020
I like my penis

01:09:11.732 --> 01:09:14.609
There's so many parts of my body which I do like.

01:09:17.947 --> 01:09:20.783
About my hair, I'm really proud of my hair,

01:09:20.991 --> 01:09:24.078
because it's not only a part of the body,

01:09:24.286 --> 01:09:26.372
but also a statement.

01:09:28.374 --> 01:09:29.959
It's also a lifestyle,

01:09:31.001 --> 01:09:33.629
pretty much connected to the way I live my life,

01:09:34.087 --> 01:09:36.256
to the freedom I want to feel.

01:09:38.425 --> 01:09:41.386
And non-conformity.

01:09:43.514 --> 01:09:44.807
The penis...

01:09:47.643 --> 01:09:48.519
I do like it,

01:09:48.727 --> 01:09:53.314
because it's one of the parts of my body

01:09:53.524 --> 01:09:57.278
which functions totally normally.

01:10:01.115 --> 01:10:03.284
I have this severe disability,

01:10:06.287 --> 01:10:11.876
but I don't suffer from my disability.

01:10:12.710 --> 01:10:16.046
There is a phrase. We are always saying

01:10:16.255 --> 01:10:20.467
he or she is suffering from disability.

01:10:20.801 --> 01:10:22.344
And I hate that phrase

01:10:24.805 --> 01:10:28.225
But still, it is complex,

01:10:29.018 --> 01:10:31.770
living in a different-abled body

01:10:35.691 --> 01:10:38.319
Sometimes I would like to scratch my head,

01:10:39.528 --> 01:10:42.323
I would like to move and I would like to...

01:10:43.657 --> 01:10:45.826
Sometimes I would like to be able

01:10:46.785 --> 01:10:49.288
to just actively fuck

01:10:49.788 --> 01:10:51.332
That would be nice

01:10:52.583 --> 01:10:56.462
Not to be passive, but to be active in that part

01:10:58.339 --> 01:10:59.840
I wish I had the opportunity

01:11:00.049 --> 01:11:01.592
to caress my wife,

01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:05.512
and to take her into my arms actively.

01:11:06.472 --> 01:11:09.558
But it's the way it is, and I'm OK with that.

01:11:10.935 --> 01:11:12.978
But therefore, I'm very very happy

01:11:13.187 --> 01:11:16.190
that my penis is very normal,

01:11:16.482 --> 01:11:19.568
and sizewise it's good

01:11:23.489 --> 01:11:24.823
Altogether,

01:11:25.866 --> 01:11:28.869
I think I'm quite an attractive man

01:11:30.746 --> 01:11:31.997
I'm different

01:11:33.207 --> 01:11:37.169
I'm not beautiful in the mainstream sense,

01:11:38.504 --> 01:11:41.382
or in terms of norm.

01:11:43.926 --> 01:11:47.137
But I don't give a fuck about norms anyway

01:11:53.435 --> 01:11:55.020
Overall,

01:11:56.438 --> 01:11:59.191
I think my body, as it is,

01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:00.567
is a gift.

01:12:01.151 --> 01:12:06.198
And life is a journey to experience that gift

01:13:37.206 --> 01:13:38.749
I know it's you

01:13:43.212 --> 01:13:44.630
Please understand.

01:13:47.549 --> 01:13:48.509
Stop calling.

01:13:51.845 --> 01:13:52.763
It's over.

01:20:19.733 --> 01:20:21.610
I didn't know you come here

01:20:23.612 --> 01:20:24.696
I don't.

01:20:26.698 --> 01:20:27.991
I'm looking for someone.

01:20:31.495 --> 01:20:32.412
And you?

01:20:33.622 --> 01:20:35.582
You come here often?

01:20:35.791 --> 01:20:36.792
Yes, sometimes.

01:20:38.376 --> 01:20:40.128
It's an interesting place

01:20:41.880 --> 01:20:42.839
I'm a searcher

01:20:43.048 --> 01:20:44.549
and a hunter

01:20:44.758 --> 01:20:50.055
for knowledge and for wisdom

01:20:50.680 --> 01:20:53.016
in sexual art

01:20:57.938 --> 01:21:01.483
Sex is a big part of my life,

01:21:02.067 --> 01:21:04.778
which I like to enjoy

01:21:05.946 --> 01:21:08.990
and to celebrate more

01:21:12.953 --> 01:21:15.747
And I like to open my mind

01:21:19.835 --> 01:21:22.212
and to get a broader horizon.

01:21:31.471 --> 01:21:34.057
I look at it a bit also like an art.

01:21:36.852 --> 01:21:37.811
Yes, because...

01:21:40.105 --> 01:21:44.109
it's not only something you do with your body,

01:21:46.111 --> 01:21:47.237
but it's also.

01:21:47.904 --> 01:21:50.448
If it's really great, then there is...

01:21:52.158 --> 01:21:53.326
I call it

01:21:55.370 --> 01:21:57.038
a moment of wonder

01:22:02.919 --> 01:22:05.672
And that's something meaningful,

01:22:06.673 --> 01:22:08.425
something which stays

01:24:34.696 --> 01:24:36.448
I was with my man

01:24:38.450 --> 01:24:40.035
trying to make love

01:24:44.372 --> 01:24:45.832
And all of a sudden,

01:24:46.291 --> 01:24:49.335
I feel there's someone with us in bed.

01:24:53.631 --> 01:24:55.800
And I realize it's my mother,

01:24:56.301 --> 01:24:58.970
just lying in bed, next to me

01:25:05.393 --> 01:25:07.645
There is this physical thing,

01:25:07.854 --> 01:25:10.023
there is this cringe in my whole body,

01:25:10.231 --> 01:25:11.941
that she shouldn't be there.

01:25:13.401 --> 01:25:14.944
So I push her out,

01:25:15.653 --> 01:25:16.988
I tell her to leave.

01:25:18.990 --> 01:25:21.743
So she gets out of the bed, she stands.

01:25:23.203 --> 01:25:24.662
And, worse than that,

01:25:26.456 --> 01:25:28.374
I realize she's naked

01:25:31.961 --> 01:25:35.465
She stands at the end of the bed,

01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:37.383
and she doesn't leave.

01:25:40.095 --> 01:25:41.679
She was like a child,

01:25:42.222 --> 01:25:45.642
standing there like this, very fragile,

01:25:45.892 --> 01:25:48.228
and saying that she doesn't wanna leave,

01:25:51.147 --> 01:25:53.441
because she doesn't want to be alone.

01:25:58.655 --> 01:26:00.782
And it gets really unbearable.

01:26:01.032 --> 01:26:02.242
I insist she leaves,

01:26:02.450 --> 01:26:04.536
I tell her that's not her place,

01:26:04.744 --> 01:26:06.037
she should leave the room.

01:26:08.498 --> 01:26:10.500
So I push my mother outside,

01:26:10.708 --> 01:26:12.961
through the hallway I close the door

01:26:14.045 --> 01:26:15.463
And guess what?

01:26:17.048 --> 01:26:19.968
She appears in the fucking door of the balcony.

01:26:20.677 --> 01:26:22.846
Standing there, naked,

01:26:24.180 --> 01:26:26.808
very fragile, very vulnerable,

01:26:27.559 --> 01:26:29.394
and she really wanted in

01:26:29.602 --> 01:26:31.771
She didn't want to be alone.

01:26:35.900 --> 01:26:37.819
And this is how I woke up

01:26:39.737 --> 01:26:41.948
And this is a dream I will never forget.

01:26:46.411 --> 01:26:47.704
It's powerful.

01:26:51.791 --> 01:26:55.003
And where's the anger in that?

01:26:57.714 --> 01:26:59.841
Well, in your dream you're not angry

01:27:00.049 --> 01:27:01.342
because you're.

01:27:02.510 --> 01:27:04.053
You want to get rid of her,

01:27:04.262 --> 01:27:07.056
but she moves you, because she needs you.

01:27:09.350 --> 01:27:11.644
You know when you talked to me about your dream,

01:27:12.270 --> 01:27:14.397
you described how fragile she looks,

01:27:14.647 --> 01:27:16.232
quite a few times.

01:27:17.108 --> 01:27:18.610
As if the fact that she was fragile

01:27:18.818 --> 01:27:21.112
meant that you couldn't be angry,

01:27:22.947 --> 01:27:25.742
because your aim isn't to hurt her

01:27:27.202 --> 01:27:29.495
Your aim is for her just to leave

01:27:34.876 --> 01:27:36.127
In dreams,

01:27:37.795 --> 01:27:39.631
you can be everybody

01:27:44.636 --> 01:27:46.095
You know, when you were talking,

01:27:46.304 --> 01:27:48.181
at one point I felt like saying to you,

01:27:48.473 --> 01:27:49.682
"Can you say the same thing, and

01:27:49.891 --> 01:27:53.061
say 'I' instead of 'her'?"

01:27:59.484 --> 01:28:01.444
I think needing someone

01:28:03.112 --> 01:28:06.449
makes me weak and vulnerable.

01:28:08.952 --> 01:28:10.119
Because.

01:28:11.704 --> 01:28:14.040
I don't have the freedom to be myself,

01:28:14.249 --> 01:28:16.209
because if I am myself, with all the shit,

01:28:16.417 --> 01:28:17.961
and with all my feelings,

01:28:18.962 --> 01:28:20.213
and especially

01:28:21.506 --> 01:28:22.924
with my anger,

01:28:24.717 --> 01:28:27.679
I'm gonna lose that person I need

01:28:34.769 --> 01:28:36.396
I understand that.

01:28:38.439 --> 01:28:41.109
Loving another without losing yourself is...

01:28:41.317 --> 01:28:42.318
Difficult

01:28:43.236 --> 01:28:44.946
It's such a damn challenge

01:28:48.241 --> 01:28:50.994
I hope that's possible.

01:28:52.203 --> 01:28:54.706
I'm looking with this huge curiosity

01:28:55.164 --> 01:28:56.582
at other people

01:28:56.791 --> 01:28:57.500
How they manage.

01:28:57.709 --> 01:28:59.544
How the fuck do they manage?

01:29:09.053 --> 01:29:10.305
The hair gets tired

01:29:10.513 --> 01:29:13.558
if you keep it out more than.

01:29:14.183 --> 01:29:17.186
Maybe you can give some coffee to your hair

01:29:18.146 --> 01:29:20.606
There's something like coffee shampoo.

01:29:20.815 --> 01:29:22.650
You have curls now.

01:29:22.942 --> 01:29:23.693
Yes.

01:29:36.247 --> 01:29:39.042
Like that? Or different?

01:29:40.251 --> 01:29:42.462
I leave this closed or open?

01:29:42.670 --> 01:29:43.713
Open.

01:29:43.963 --> 01:29:45.506
- Open like that?
- Open

01:29:46.382 --> 01:29:47.800
I like it open.

01:29:48.885 --> 01:29:51.387
I've got a knot down there.

01:29:52.305 --> 01:29:56.142
You know, closed is maybe more practical,

01:29:56.351 --> 01:29:58.061
but this is far more beautiful.

01:29:58.895 --> 01:30:00.521
You look so female.

01:30:10.281 --> 01:30:12.700
Can you come a bit closer?

01:30:12.909 --> 01:30:15.536
And put my arm a bit backwards.

01:30:15.745 --> 01:30:16.954
Like that?

01:30:21.250 --> 01:30:23.211
I think we have an audience.

01:30:24.003 --> 01:30:25.630
It does look like it.

01:30:32.720 --> 01:30:34.180
What do you feel now?

01:30:35.681 --> 01:30:38.810
When you allow us in your intimacy?

01:30:39.268 --> 01:30:41.896
What makes you allow us

01:30:43.439 --> 01:30:46.734
in there, in that very special place?

01:30:49.737 --> 01:30:54.409
I feel trusted and trusting at the same time,

01:30:54.617 --> 01:30:57.954
and I feel I really hope

01:30:58.162 --> 01:31:02.875
that I can change people's perspective,

01:31:03.292 --> 01:31:06.546
that I can change your perspective,

01:31:06.754 --> 01:31:08.631
as an audience

01:31:09.257 --> 01:31:12.009
That you have a wider horizon

01:31:12.218 --> 01:31:14.804
after you have seen me.

01:31:15.596 --> 01:31:19.142
And I invite you to celebrate your body

01:31:19.350 --> 01:31:21.769
and enjoy it every day.

01:31:22.520 --> 01:31:25.857
I'm here now, also. With you

01:31:26.649 --> 01:31:27.692
- Hi.
- Hi, Tomas!

01:31:27.900 --> 01:31:28.651
Hi.

01:31:32.405 --> 01:31:33.281
I've been very touched

01:31:33.489 --> 01:31:36.826
by watching your relationship

01:31:39.120 --> 01:31:41.873
It's very emotional to hear that.

01:31:44.333 --> 01:31:45.460
I felt like

01:31:46.752 --> 01:31:50.256
a connection that was on a very deep level.

01:31:52.175 --> 01:31:52.967
Yeah.

01:31:54.760 --> 01:31:56.304
And it's.

01:31:56.804 --> 01:31:57.763
It's inspiring to see

01:31:57.972 --> 01:32:02.310
such a strong connection.

01:32:05.354 --> 01:32:06.272
It's..

01:32:08.191 --> 01:32:10.151
My whole vision of you has changed so much

01:32:10.359 --> 01:32:11.611
since I met you first.

01:32:13.237 --> 01:32:18.034
When I saw Grit so strong, carrying you and...

01:32:18.242 --> 01:32:20.536
She was this rock. And then.

01:32:20.786 --> 01:32:24.040
I saw the whole situation turn around when.

01:32:24.248 --> 01:32:26.042
you were the rock and she was

01:32:26.876 --> 01:32:29.170
in a situation where she felt weak.

01:32:33.049 --> 01:32:35.635
It's beautiful to see this balance

01:32:37.637 --> 01:32:38.721
I think it's important

01:32:38.930 --> 01:32:41.849
to have balance in your relationship.

01:32:42.391 --> 01:32:44.685
Many people don't see that balance with us,

01:32:44.894 --> 01:32:48.689
but we are in a good balance, I guess

01:32:50.525 --> 01:32:53.194
Otherwise it wouldn't work for such a long time.

01:32:57.490 --> 01:32:58.741
Do you think, Grit,

01:32:58.950 --> 01:33:04.163
that your way of perceiving the world has changed

01:33:04.580 --> 01:33:06.624
since you are together?

01:33:08.584 --> 01:33:11.212
Definitely, I feel really held

01:33:12.380 --> 01:33:15.132
in Christian's arms,

01:33:15.341 --> 01:33:16.676
very much.

01:33:18.511 --> 01:33:24.141
And it's a feeling of strength, and a feeling

01:33:24.350 --> 01:33:28.771
of trust and warmth.

01:33:29.063 --> 01:33:32.024
And I don't feel that I need to show people

01:33:32.233 --> 01:33:34.151
I'm strong, or so.

01:33:34.485 --> 01:33:35.486
It seems

01:33:35.695 --> 01:33:39.448
we have a very natural relationship to each other

01:33:42.201 --> 01:33:44.912
It's not that we are,

01:33:45.121 --> 01:33:46.872
as a relationship,

01:33:47.081 --> 01:33:51.002
it's also not that we are always "happy together"

01:33:51.210 --> 01:33:56.591
or in a state of "cloud 11" or so.

01:33:57.008 --> 01:33:59.635
We are very grumpy sometimes,

01:34:00.011 --> 01:34:02.930
and we clash with each other sometimes

01:34:03.306 --> 01:34:07.393
Especially when we are in a stressful situation

01:34:07.602 --> 01:34:09.103
But I have the feeling you are very honest

01:34:09.312 --> 01:34:12.189
- always, with how you feel.
- Yes.

01:34:12.398 --> 01:34:15.610
I think this honesty is very important

01:34:15.985 --> 01:34:17.528
because we know that,

01:34:17.737 --> 01:34:20.865
even if for one minute we shout at each other,

01:34:21.073 --> 01:34:23.534
the next minute we will be good again

01:34:53.189 --> 01:34:55.274
You're very clear with some boundaries,

01:34:55.483 --> 01:34:56.359
aren't you?

01:34:58.235 --> 01:34:59.987
If you can't say no,

01:35:00.196 --> 01:35:02.073
you can never really say yes.

01:35:03.908 --> 01:35:05.409
Would you like to explore your boundaries

01:35:05.618 --> 01:35:08.871
in a ritual in which there's no expectation?

01:35:09.413 --> 01:35:10.998
- OK.
- Yes?

01:35:11.207 --> 01:35:12.792
Can I put my hand here?

01:35:14.335 --> 01:35:15.878
How does that feel?

01:35:52.665 --> 01:35:53.624
OK.

01:36:05.636 --> 01:36:07.930
- What's going on?
- I got kind of nausea.

01:36:15.563 --> 01:36:16.814
From the hand?

01:36:22.069 --> 01:36:23.195
I don't know.

01:36:28.242 --> 01:36:31.078
Now we go here, just below, between your.

01:36:31.287 --> 01:36:33.289
- My plexus.
- Your plexus.

01:36:34.790 --> 01:36:36.250
- How does that feel?
- OK

01:36:36.792 --> 01:36:38.169
I push a little bit.

01:36:39.044 --> 01:36:40.838
I'm gonna come down

01:36:41.881 --> 01:36:43.090
to your belly

01:36:45.801 --> 01:36:47.052
Is that OK there?

01:36:59.607 --> 01:37:00.858
How does that feel?

01:37:02.651 --> 01:37:04.945
It's beginning to feel uncomfortable

01:37:06.447 --> 01:37:08.157
Somewhere here is a jump.

01:37:09.116 --> 01:37:11.452
Somewhere here is a jump between you and me

01:37:21.003 --> 01:37:22.922
Can I touch you hungrily?

01:37:24.799 --> 01:37:26.425
That's the trigger, I think.

01:37:30.888 --> 01:37:32.848
And what do I do with your hunger?

01:37:38.020 --> 01:37:39.939
Someone's desire for you,

01:37:40.648 --> 01:37:43.609
a man's desire for you is a big trigger.

01:37:46.111 --> 01:37:47.363
This is what I'm feeling here,

01:37:47.571 --> 01:37:49.740
the second I start to pull you in.

01:37:50.616 --> 01:37:51.784
That's gonna be a trigger there.

01:37:51.992 --> 01:37:55.454
That's related to your father and all this other stuff

01:38:00.042 --> 01:38:01.293
Breath with me.

01:38:07.967 --> 01:38:09.301
We're ready?

01:38:14.390 --> 01:38:17.268
Pulling you in. Feeling my lust.

01:38:17.476 --> 01:38:19.144
Feeling my genitals

01:38:26.068 --> 01:38:27.403
Very strong defense

01:38:32.992 --> 01:38:33.909
Keep going

01:38:44.587 --> 01:38:47.089
When you nod, I'm gonna do it again, ready?

01:38:54.722 --> 01:38:56.599
Powerful and potent.

01:39:18.913 --> 01:39:20.039
Stay with it.

01:39:20.623 --> 01:39:21.749
Stay with me

01:39:22.374 --> 01:39:23.626
Show me your eyes

01:39:24.710 --> 01:39:26.795
All emotion welcome here

01:42:21.845 --> 01:42:22.763
What happened?

01:42:24.807 --> 01:42:25.933
It's OK.

01:42:26.141 --> 01:42:27.142
It's OK.

01:44:02.487 --> 01:44:04.281
There's a lot of things

01:44:04.489 --> 01:44:06.366
that happened the last days for me.

01:44:07.242 --> 01:44:10.412
Internal changes and.

01:44:13.707 --> 01:44:17.794
There's something very important that I realized.

01:44:18.295 --> 01:44:20.464
Which came to me like an epiphany

01:44:22.299 --> 01:44:25.344
It is, when Christian was talking about my wall,

01:44:25.761 --> 01:44:27.512
which is something I'm conscious of,

01:44:27.721 --> 01:44:30.474
And I've been trying to work on for a very long time.

01:44:30.682 --> 01:44:34.311
And to me, this wall was always a wall

01:44:34.728 --> 01:44:36.939
to protect me from something outside,

01:44:37.147 --> 01:44:39.900
not coming into me.

01:44:41.193 --> 01:44:45.739
And suddenly, yesterday, it came to me in a flash,

01:44:46.823 --> 01:44:49.868
that this wall was absolutely not to protect

01:44:50.244 --> 01:44:52.621
anything from outside coming in

01:44:53.163 --> 01:44:55.499
It was absolutely the opposite.

01:44:55.707 --> 01:45:00.128
I'm protecting something from the inside

01:45:00.337 --> 01:45:01.797
which can come out.

01:45:03.382 --> 01:45:06.927
This filter on what emotion I'm ready to let out

01:45:07.261 --> 01:45:09.096
makes me so unfree.

01:46:12.367 --> 01:46:13.702
Stay there

01:48:37.429 --> 01:48:39.097
Everything is good

01:48:45.437 --> 01:48:46.605
Good girl

01:50:07.769 --> 01:50:09.187
Why did you come?

01:50:13.567 --> 01:50:14.776
I'm curious.

01:50:17.153 --> 01:50:18.780
I'm curious to know

01:50:20.991 --> 01:50:22.867
why you are following me.

01:50:39.217 --> 01:50:41.052
I'd like you to look at me.

01:50:42.846 --> 01:50:43.680
OK.

01:50:47.559 --> 01:50:49.144
I'm looking at you now.

01:50:58.236 --> 01:51:01.489
I'd like you. to look at me naked.

01:51:52.415 --> 01:51:53.583
Can you watch me?

01:52:11.434 --> 01:52:12.769
You can do it.

01:52:17.524 --> 01:52:18.274
OK.

01:52:20.860 --> 01:52:21.986
It's OK.

01:52:24.489 --> 01:52:25.532
It's OK.

01:52:27.742 --> 01:52:29.035
I'm watching you now

01:52:38.962 --> 01:52:40.547
I'm watching your body now.

01:52:56.438 --> 01:52:57.981
Can you sing me a lullaby?

01:53:00.275 --> 01:53:01.651
A lullaby.

01:53:03.111 --> 01:53:05.405
I'm not quite sure I can remember a lullaby.

01:53:09.826 --> 01:53:12.495
There was this song I used to like when I was young

01:53:13.329 --> 01:53:14.748
It kind of went.

01:53:19.669 --> 01:53:23.673
<i>I used to have this girlfriend known as Elsie</i>

01:53:24.716 --> 01:53:28.094
<i>She used to have this little room in Chelsea.</i>

01:53:28.803 --> 01:53:32.599
<i>She wasn't what you'd call a blushing flower.</i>

01:53:33.183 --> 01:53:36.478
<i>As a matter of fact, she rented by the hour.</i>

01:53:37.979 --> 01:53:41.983
<i>The day she died, the neighbours came to snicker.</i>

01:53:43.318 --> 01:53:46.237
<i>That's what comes</i>
<i>with too many beers and liquor.</i>

01:53:47.489 --> 01:53:51.868
<i>But when I saw her laid out like a queen,</i>

01:53:53.328 --> 01:53:56.664
<i>she was the happiest corpse I'd ever seen.</i>

01:53:56.873 --> 01:54:00.126
It's one of the best lullabies I've ever heard

01:54:04.214 --> 01:54:06.508
You want me to sing you a lullaby?

01:54:06.966 --> 01:54:08.301
In Icelandic.

01:54:43.086 --> 01:54:44.462
What's it about?

01:54:54.389 --> 01:54:55.431
It's like..

01:54:55.640 --> 01:54:58.059
Sleep, my little baby.

01:55:02.397 --> 01:55:04.232
Rain is crying outside

01:55:11.030 --> 01:55:13.491
Mommy is keeping your little toys.

01:55:19.455 --> 01:55:21.541
You shouldn't be awake

01:55:22.917 --> 01:55:24.627
in the dark night.

01:55:33.344 --> 01:55:34.971
I used to feel very calm

01:55:35.179 --> 01:55:37.140
when my mom sang this to me

01:55:54.908 --> 01:55:57.452
I was so sure I knew everything

01:55:58.494 --> 01:56:00.246
about intimacy,

01:56:00.538 --> 01:56:01.915
about trust,

01:56:02.123 --> 01:56:03.416
desire,

01:56:03.958 --> 01:56:04.918
safety

01:56:07.128 --> 01:56:08.838
As time passed by,

01:56:09.047 --> 01:56:11.424
with real life, with real people,

01:56:12.216 --> 01:56:16.095
all my so clear - once - views on things

01:56:16.304 --> 01:56:18.431
got gradually destabilized.

01:56:22.310 --> 01:56:25.355
After 20 years of being away from home,

01:56:25.980 --> 01:56:29.067
of thinking I'm a free, grown-up woman,

01:56:31.110 --> 01:56:34.280
I understood the umbilical cord between us

01:56:34.530 --> 01:56:36.574
hasn't actually been cut

01:56:38.034 --> 01:56:39.118
Not yet.

01:56:41.329 --> 01:56:43.748
You're still running through my veins

01:56:47.251 --> 01:56:49.003
As a dear friend put it:

01:56:49.379 --> 01:56:51.089
Tell me how you were loved,

01:56:51.297 --> 01:56:53.216
to tell you how you love.

01:56:55.385 --> 01:56:56.386
Tell me

01:56:57.178 --> 01:56:58.638
how you loved me,

01:56:59.973 --> 01:57:02.517
so I can understand how I love,

01:57:03.434 --> 01:57:04.769
how to love

01:57:10.608 --> 01:57:11.818
When I started to ask you

01:57:12.026 --> 01:57:13.653
about all these memories,

01:57:14.028 --> 01:57:16.239
do you remember how difficult it was,

01:57:16.614 --> 01:57:17.907
for both of us?

01:57:20.910 --> 01:57:24.497
I came to understand how this love-myth

01:57:24.872 --> 01:57:28.001
hides so many conflicting emotions,

01:57:30.378 --> 01:57:32.130
how layers of anger,

01:57:33.381 --> 01:57:34.465
guilt,

01:57:34.841 --> 01:57:36.009
violence

01:57:37.135 --> 01:57:40.096
make it so difficult to reach that "love".

01:57:43.391 --> 01:57:45.184
And how today, I carry with me,

01:57:45.393 --> 01:57:47.395
in my intimate life,

01:57:48.688 --> 01:57:51.149
the fear of losing the one I love,

01:57:51.357 --> 01:57:52.734
the distrust,

01:57:52.942 --> 01:57:54.318
the anger,

01:57:55.194 --> 01:57:57.321
the never fulfilled longing.

01:58:01.284 --> 01:58:02.660
Is there also a conflict

01:58:02.869 --> 01:58:05.413
between your image of me

01:58:06.706 --> 01:58:08.374
and who I really am?

01:58:10.251 --> 01:58:12.045
And am I maybe still

01:58:12.253 --> 01:58:14.464
too afraid to ruin this image,

01:58:16.966 --> 01:58:18.676
for fear I lose you?

01:58:20.470 --> 01:58:24.348
Is this maybe why we never talked about this film?

02:03:11.594 --> 02:03:14.764
<i>Mela-mela, melancholy</i>

02:03:16.891 --> 02:03:20.186
<i>Melancholy, my dear</i>

02:03:23.064 --> 02:03:26.567
<i>Mela-mela, melancholy</i>

02:03:26.776 --> 02:03:32.073
<i>Floats over the new city and over the country</i>

02:03:39.622 --> 02:03:42.833
<i>Over the control centers</i>

02:03:43.584 --> 02:03:48.255
<i>Over the concrete stubble fields</i>

02:03:51.759 --> 02:03:54.220
<i>Over the secret bunkers</i>

02:03:54.428 --> 02:03:59.266
<i>Which are impossible to remove</i>

02:04:03.771 --> 02:04:06.399
<i>Marlene, go home!</i>

02:04:08.067 --> 02:04:13.823
<i>Over the Marlene-Dietrich-Platz, too</i>

02:04:25.376 --> 02:04:29.839
<i>The new temples are already cracked,</i>

02:04:34.051 --> 02:04:36.637
<i>Future ruins</i>

02:04:41.225 --> 02:04:46.355
<i>One day, grass will grow over this city too,</i>

02:04:51.610 --> 02:04:53.988
<i>Over its last layer</i>

02:05:03.914 --> 02:05:08.252
<i>Mela-mela, melancholy</i>

02:05:10.129 --> 02:05:13.174
<i>Melancholy, my dear</i>

02:05:16.385 --> 02:05:19.638
<i>Mela-mela, melancholy</i>

02:05:19.847 --> 02:05:25.686
<i>Floats over the new city and over the country</i>

02:06:10.773 --> 02:06:13.692
<i>In the sky slashed to pieces</i>

02:06:14.818 --> 02:06:18.739
<i>By the rehearsing jets flying across.</i>

02:06:24.328 --> 02:06:28.541
<i>She hangs with widespread wings</i>

02:06:39.593 --> 02:06:41.845
<i>Sleepless,</i>

02:06:43.138 --> 02:06:45.808
<i>Her frozen gaze</i>

02:06:51.188 --> 02:06:53.732
<i>Turned towards the rubble</i>

02:06:56.569 --> 02:07:01.073
<i>Behind her, the future is piling up</i>

02:07:04.535 --> 02:07:08.998
<i>Slowly, she flies higher and higher,</i>

02:07:12.334 --> 02:07:18.966
<i>Finally overseeing the whole country</i>

02:07:20.759 --> 02:07:27.891
<i>What's the state of the country?</i>

02:07:28.726 --> 02:07:35.733
<i>What's the state of the country?</i>

02:07:36.305 --> 02:07:42.241
