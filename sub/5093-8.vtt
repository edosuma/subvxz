WEBVTT

00:11.380 --> 00:12.997
I'm getting tired of

00:12.999 --> 00:14.202
discussing this, Nicky.
Hey!

00:14.203 --> 00:15.619
You're being totally
unreasonable.

00:15.621 --> 00:17.587
No, I am being
your mother.

00:17.589 --> 00:19.206
Hi, Dad.
Thank you for...

00:19.208 --> 00:20.657
letting us stay here.

00:20.659 --> 00:23.176
Well, I wasn't gonna let you get
poisoned by the fumigator.

00:23.178 --> 00:24.294
Can we please focus?

00:24.296 --> 00:25.378
It's just a party, Mom.

00:25.380 --> 00:26.379
Which happens to be

00:26.381 --> 00:28.215
taking place
on a college campus.

00:28.217 --> 00:29.516
Here, put the roast away,
please.

00:29.518 --> 00:31.017
Pork roast or beef?

00:31.019 --> 00:32.636
It's not like I'll be by myself.
I'll be with Greg.

00:32.637 --> 00:34.304
Right, Greg,

00:34.306 --> 00:36.773
the NYU freshman
who happens to be 19.

00:36.775 --> 00:38.108
He's a really nice guy, Mom.

00:38.110 --> 00:39.776
And he's my friend Amy's
brother's roommate.

00:39.778 --> 00:41.111
And that's supposed
to constitute

00:41.113 --> 00:42.979
some kind of high-level
security clearance?

00:42.981 --> 00:44.397
What happened to
that nice boy

00:44.399 --> 00:45.615
Luke from the party?

00:45.617 --> 00:46.783
Luke's a friend.

00:46.785 --> 00:48.118
Oh, so Greg the college guy

00:48.120 --> 00:49.369
is more than
a friend?

00:49.371 --> 00:50.620
Where are you going?

00:51.455 --> 00:52.739
I wasn't aware I was part

00:52.741 --> 00:54.074
of this conversation.

00:54.076 --> 00:56.209
Your 16-year-old
granddaughter

00:56.211 --> 00:58.862
wants to go to a college party
where there's drinking

00:58.864 --> 00:59.863
and God knows what else.

00:59.865 --> 01:01.030
It's a party, Mother,

01:01.032 --> 01:02.215
not a drunken orgy.

01:02.217 --> 01:03.633
Tell her, Grandpa.

01:03.635 --> 01:04.968
Yeah, Grandpa.

01:06.420 --> 01:09.723
I think the au gratin potatoes
would go great with the roast.

01:09.725 --> 01:12.041
Pork or beef.

01:17.065 --> 01:18.181
Open that.

01:18.183 --> 01:20.400
Thank you, sir.

01:23.604 --> 01:25.405
Give me a minute.

01:25.407 --> 01:26.723
What?

01:31.061 --> 01:33.997
Hey, you guys shooting
a movie or something?

01:33.999 --> 01:35.999
We're fighting
for our fellow man.

01:36.001 --> 01:37.334
That was gonna
be my next guess.

01:37.336 --> 01:39.452
Jamie?

01:39.454 --> 01:41.204
Jamie Reagan?

01:41.206 --> 01:42.372
Dana?

01:42.374 --> 01:44.341
Oh, my God, how are you?

01:44.343 --> 01:45.675
Great.

01:45.677 --> 01:48.612
I heard that you left
Baxter Chase to become a cop.

01:48.614 --> 01:51.965
And apparently you left Harper
Manning to become a superhero.

01:51.967 --> 01:53.350
Just moonlighting.

01:53.352 --> 01:55.252
I joined a group
called Homeless Avengers.

01:55.254 --> 01:57.520
We give out food and supplies.

01:57.522 --> 01:58.655
Wow.

01:58.657 --> 02:01.224
Buying your soul back
from Wall Street, huh?

02:01.226 --> 02:02.976
Very funny.

02:02.978 --> 02:04.244
This is my partner Arnie.

02:04.246 --> 02:05.395
Hey, how you doing?

02:05.397 --> 02:07.497
Honestly?
The spandex is killing me.

02:07.499 --> 02:09.249
What's with the costumes?

02:09.251 --> 02:10.900
Thank you.
Sure.

02:10.901 --> 02:14.087
They advertise the cause,
and they put everyone at ease.

02:14.089 --> 02:15.372
Uh, well, it's...

02:15.374 --> 02:17.040
it's working for you.

02:17.042 --> 02:19.893
You know what?

02:19.895 --> 02:22.162
Uh... call me.

02:22.164 --> 02:23.813
I'd love to catch up.

02:23.815 --> 02:26.349
Okay. I'll do that.

02:27.184 --> 02:29.135
Be safe.

02:31.000 --> 02:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:39.263 --> 02:41.231
What've we got?

02:41.233 --> 02:44.067
Connor Riley, 20 years old,
student at the university.

02:44.069 --> 02:45.768
Found this stuff
lying with him.

02:45.770 --> 02:46.953
Oh, looky, looky.

02:46.955 --> 02:48.571
Wow.

02:48.573 --> 02:50.407
It looks like good stuff.

02:50.409 --> 02:51.741
And you know that how?

02:51.743 --> 02:52.959
I went to college.

02:52.961 --> 02:54.044
Oh, right.

02:54.046 --> 02:55.996
Okay, so maybe kid
tries to buy an ounce,

02:55.998 --> 02:57.297
ends up paying with his life.

02:57.299 --> 02:58.915
Close, but no cigar.

02:59.783 --> 03:01.084
Or... in this case,

03:01.086 --> 03:03.420
no big fat Bob Marley joint.

03:04.472 --> 03:05.455
Can we help you?

03:05.457 --> 03:08.453
- Doubtful. But I can help you.
- Really?

03:08.454 --> 03:10.596
This kid wasn't a buyer;
he was a seller.

03:10.696 --> 03:13.396
Detective Eddie Stone,
Manhattan North Narcotics.

03:14.649 --> 03:15.965
And how do you know that?

03:15.967 --> 03:17.684
We just opened a case on campus

03:17.686 --> 03:19.302
looking to bust the ass-clowns

03:19.304 --> 03:21.738
supplying these student dealers
like, uh...

03:21.740 --> 03:22.989
Connor the Goner here.

03:22.991 --> 03:26.295
Yeah, well, this is
a homicide case now, so...

03:26.320 --> 03:26.827
Oh.

03:26.828 --> 03:29.446
Time for the real cops
to step in.

03:30.114 --> 03:31.331
Have no fear,

03:31.333 --> 03:33.249
the Squad is here.

03:33.251 --> 03:34.417
He didn't say that.

03:34.419 --> 03:35.835
But now that you mention it...

03:35.837 --> 03:38.321
I know. Narcotics,
we're a bunch of street cowboys

03:38.323 --> 03:41.657
who can't find our own asses
with a treasure map, right?

03:41.659 --> 03:43.526
Sounded like a mixed metaphor
to me.

03:43.528 --> 03:45.628
Look, this kid getting
whacked ties directly

03:45.630 --> 03:47.997
to my investigation,
so all I'm asking is

03:47.999 --> 03:50.300
for you to keep
me in the loop.

03:50.302 --> 03:51.935
Uh, no, thanks.

03:51.937 --> 03:55.105
Professional courtesy.

03:57.508 --> 03:59.976
And you might want to...

03:59.978 --> 04:01.611
bag that cash,

04:01.613 --> 04:03.980
so it doesn't walk away.

04:04.782 --> 04:06.232
Funny guy.

04:06.234 --> 04:07.517
Yeah.

04:07.519 --> 04:09.736
And here I thought
all narcotics detectives

04:09.738 --> 04:12.322
were a bunch of cocky dirtbags.

04:12.324 --> 04:13.873
Oh, well.

Thanks for coming in.

04:48.476 --> 04:50.009
Happy to help if I can.

04:50.011 --> 04:52.011
Sure, um, you spoke
to a uniform

04:52.013 --> 04:54.446
at the, uh, crime scene.

04:54.448 --> 04:55.481
You work close by?

04:55.483 --> 04:56.749
Yes. I was, uh...

04:56.751 --> 04:58.400
I was leaving my office late.

04:58.402 --> 05:00.653
I teach economics
at the university.

05:00.655 --> 05:02.521
I'm working
on a book.

05:02.523 --> 05:06.024
When I heard this horrible music
blasting from an SUV.

05:06.026 --> 05:07.543
Can you describe the SUV?

05:07.545 --> 05:09.795
Uh, it was white
with tinted windows--

05:09.797 --> 05:11.330
couldn't see inside.

05:11.332 --> 05:13.666
Was there anything
distinctive about it?

05:13.668 --> 05:15.584
Well...

05:15.586 --> 05:18.337
yeah, I noticed the rear
license plate-- it was missing.

05:18.339 --> 05:19.638
Uh, instead,

05:19.640 --> 05:21.707
there was a small purple skull.

05:21.709 --> 05:23.809
It was pretty scary stuff.

05:23.811 --> 05:24.843
Well, that could be helpful.

05:24.845 --> 05:26.211
Yeah. Uh... you say
you wrote a book.

05:26.213 --> 05:27.680
What's it about?

05:27.682 --> 05:30.149
The variables of contestable
market theory.

05:30.151 --> 05:33.051
Sounds like a real page-turner.

05:33.053 --> 05:35.821
Something tells me I'm not gonna
get a movie deal out of it.

05:37.574 --> 05:40.659
I understand Connor's death
may have been drug-related?

05:40.661 --> 05:41.893
It is possible.

05:41.895 --> 05:44.029
Such a waste.

05:44.031 --> 05:46.115
Well, if you think of anything
else, you'll let us know.

05:46.117 --> 05:47.750
Yeah.

05:47.752 --> 05:48.834
Thanks again.

05:48.836 --> 05:51.036
Could you, uh, walk
the professor out, please?

05:52.622 --> 05:55.958
You know, that desk
doesn't look bad on you.

05:55.960 --> 05:57.626
What?
I'm just saying,

05:57.628 --> 06:00.679
that way we don't have to yell
across the squad room, you know?

06:00.681 --> 06:01.880
Oh, yeah, that makes sense.

06:01.882 --> 06:03.265
Mmm.

06:03.267 --> 06:04.600
Anything off the professor?

06:04.602 --> 06:06.802
A vehicle.
We'll look into it.

06:06.804 --> 06:09.021
Uh-huh. Got a call
from the chief of D's office.

06:09.023 --> 06:11.140
Due to the nature of the
homicide, they informed me

06:11.142 --> 06:13.258
we're gonna be working this
as a joint case

06:13.260 --> 06:14.443
with the Narcotics Division.

06:14.445 --> 06:15.477
Whoa. What?

06:15.479 --> 06:17.596
What do we need those guys for?

06:17.598 --> 06:19.765
You need 'em because the
chief of D says you need 'em.

06:19.767 --> 06:22.618
They have the SAFE-T-Net
numbers for all the players

06:22.620 --> 06:24.153
and locations involved.
You won't be able

06:24.155 --> 06:25.954
to make a move
without their blessing anyway.

06:25.956 --> 06:28.123
Maybe they'll give us permission
to use the restroom, too.

06:28.125 --> 06:30.325
Okay. So, when do
we meet this narc?

06:30.327 --> 06:31.660
Mm-hmm.

06:31.662 --> 06:33.445
Howdy, partners.

06:40.953 --> 06:44.390
Oh, man, Professor Giordano,
what a piece of work.

06:44.392 --> 06:46.892
"Mr. Reagan,
please recite the precedents

06:46.894 --> 06:49.845
of <i>Marbury v. Madison</i>
in reverse alphabetical order."

06:49.847 --> 06:52.064
He was always nice to me.

06:52.066 --> 06:54.817
Yeah, and every other hot girl
in class.

06:54.819 --> 06:56.568
So you thought I was hot?

06:58.806 --> 07:01.940
Did you hear that Will Scanlon
is running for Congress?

07:01.942 --> 07:04.660
He's been hitting me up
for contributions for months.

07:04.662 --> 07:06.195
Yeah, he never called me.

07:06.197 --> 07:08.831
Must've heard I was on
a cop's salary these days.

07:10.133 --> 07:13.869
I got to say, I really admire
the choice you made, Jamie.

07:13.871 --> 07:17.539
You help people, just like we
said we were gonna do.

07:17.541 --> 07:19.324
You talked about working
for Legal Aid back then.

07:19.326 --> 07:20.492
Whatever happened with that?

07:20.494 --> 07:23.512
120 grand in college loans
happened with that.

07:23.514 --> 07:26.014
Here you go.
Thanks.

07:26.016 --> 07:27.332
So you hit Wall Street

07:27.334 --> 07:29.334
and hooked up with the
Homeless Avengers, huh?

07:29.336 --> 07:31.186
Just trying to do my part.

07:31.188 --> 07:33.055
I think it's great.
You got to be careful, though.

07:33.057 --> 07:34.606
Some of those neighborhoods
that you're working in...

07:34.608 --> 07:36.942
It's not like I'm alone.
I've got Arnie.

07:36.944 --> 07:39.228
Okay.

07:42.950 --> 07:45.901
So... you still talk to Sidney?

07:45.903 --> 07:50.522
We went our separate ways after
we broke off the engagement.

07:50.524 --> 07:54.710
You dating some sexy lady cop
these days?

07:54.712 --> 07:56.528
Nope. You sleeping your way
to the top

07:56.530 --> 07:57.796
with some fat senior partner?

07:57.798 --> 08:01.300
No. It's not a bad idea, though.

08:05.638 --> 08:07.873
Damn. I got to go.

08:07.875 --> 08:09.057
Let me get this.

08:09.059 --> 08:10.142
No, please.

08:10.144 --> 08:12.678
I may be poor, but I
still have my dignity.

08:12.680 --> 08:17.900
So, maybe I can pay you back
with dinner sometime?

08:17.902 --> 08:19.101
Sounds good.

08:19.103 --> 08:22.220
As long as you promise
to wear that costume.

08:32.030 --> 08:33.899
We interviewed
the victim's roommate.

08:33.900 --> 08:35.534
No help there.

08:35.535 --> 08:37.919
You grab up
the vic's computer?

08:37.922 --> 08:39.837
Geez, the computer.

08:39.840 --> 08:41.405
Why didn't we think of that?

08:41.408 --> 08:43.457
You know, thank goodness we got
a Narcotics detective

08:43.460 --> 08:45.577
to show us how
to investigate a homicide now.

08:45.579 --> 08:47.148
Look, we got off
on the wrong foot.

08:47.173 --> 08:48.298
You think?

08:48.299 --> 08:49.631
I've been trying for months

08:49.633 --> 08:51.967
to get a case up and running
on that campus.

08:51.969 --> 08:54.052
You guys waltz in
and take over the show.

08:54.054 --> 08:55.804
Not like we planned it that way.

08:55.806 --> 08:57.973
I was out of line, okay?

08:57.975 --> 09:00.392
I know the territory here.

09:00.394 --> 09:02.728
So what do you say
we start over?

09:04.564 --> 09:06.064
Fine.
Connor's smart.

09:06.066 --> 09:09.535
At least smart enough not to use
his laptop to do a drug deal.

09:09.537 --> 09:11.537
We've checked the surveillance
cameras in the area

09:11.539 --> 09:13.455
and we spoke to campus police.
Nothing yet.

09:13.457 --> 09:14.606
So?

09:14.608 --> 09:16.241
So we wait
for a ballistics report

09:16.243 --> 09:18.627
and see if there's anything
in that that we could use.

09:18.629 --> 09:21.580
All due respect,
you want to collar the joker

09:21.582 --> 09:23.999
who's supplying the campus,
we got to play offense.

09:24.001 --> 09:25.450
This is a homicide case.

09:25.452 --> 09:27.452
We're chasing a killer,
not a dealer.

09:27.454 --> 09:30.472
Play it right, nail them both.

09:30.474 --> 09:31.957
How do you figure?

09:31.959 --> 09:34.893
We set up a sting on campus,

09:34.895 --> 09:36.812
take down one of these
other student dealers.

09:36.814 --> 09:38.647
These kids all know
each other,

09:38.649 --> 09:39.982
they buy from the same guy.

09:39.984 --> 09:42.267
Might get us
a solid lead on the shooter.

09:46.306 --> 09:48.190
All right.

09:48.192 --> 09:51.142
But remember,
<i>we</i> call the shots, not you.

09:52.111 --> 09:54.246
Let's have us some fun.

09:54.248 --> 09:57.032
Yeah, let's have a ball.

10:00.153 --> 10:01.320
Hey!

10:01.322 --> 10:02.988
Hey.
Hi.

10:08.261 --> 10:09.962
She's got your mother's eyes.

10:09.964 --> 10:13.832
And she's got
my dad's stubborn streak.

10:13.834 --> 10:15.767
I know you want
to stay out of it,

10:15.769 --> 10:17.335
but I could really use
your help

10:17.337 --> 10:18.637
on this college
party issue.

10:18.639 --> 10:19.855
Look, I'll admit Nicky's

10:19.857 --> 10:21.390
a little young
for a college party.

10:21.392 --> 10:22.841
And you'll tell her that?

10:22.843 --> 10:25.143
You're her mother.

10:25.145 --> 10:27.312
You say no, it's no.

10:27.314 --> 10:29.531
Of course it's no.

10:29.533 --> 10:32.951
It's not like you let me run
around like that when I was 16.

10:32.953 --> 10:34.703
Sure, we did.

10:34.705 --> 10:37.539
This from the guy who had his
daughter followed by the NYPD.

10:39.125 --> 10:41.710
That's a bit of an exaggeration.

10:42.745 --> 10:44.329
Jamie, can you do me a favor?

10:44.331 --> 10:45.914
Can you go upstairs
and make sure

10:45.916 --> 10:48.300
Nicky is doing her homework?
I want to talk to Dad.

10:48.302 --> 10:50.669
Conspiring behind your
daughter's back.

10:50.671 --> 10:52.704
Wait until you have kids.

10:56.226 --> 10:59.111
Dad, all I'm asking

10:59.113 --> 11:02.314
is that you show a little bit
of that wisdom

11:02.316 --> 11:05.067
and foresight that you showed me
when I was her age.

11:05.069 --> 11:07.686
Now I'm being played.

11:07.688 --> 11:11.273
It's a different world
and it's scarier.

11:11.275 --> 11:13.325
Do you know that Danny
is investigating

11:13.327 --> 11:14.743
a murder of a
college student?

11:14.745 --> 11:16.111
I'm aware.

11:16.113 --> 11:18.163
Raising kids is tough.

11:18.165 --> 11:19.230
You try to give them space

11:19.232 --> 11:20.749
while you're trying
to keep them safe.

11:20.751 --> 11:22.617
Do you think I'm
being overprotective?

11:22.619 --> 11:26.505
I think you're a single mother
to a teenager.

11:26.507 --> 11:28.757
Your mom and I had you
outnumbered two to one,

11:28.759 --> 11:30.375
and you still won
most of the time.

11:30.377 --> 11:33.762
And so you'll tell her that
I'm right about the party?

11:34.597 --> 11:37.099
That's way above my pay grade.

11:37.101 --> 11:41.803
I will take that as a yes, and
don't tell her that we talked.

11:42.638 --> 11:44.589
Conversation never happened.

11:57.954 --> 12:00.655
What happened to
your drug dealer?

12:00.657 --> 12:02.040
We got a no-show here.

12:02.042 --> 12:03.291
Well, I set up the buy

12:03.293 --> 12:05.127
on a Web site
these kids created.

12:05.129 --> 12:07.829
You tell them what you want,
they tell you how much,

12:07.831 --> 12:09.464
then they bring it to you.

12:09.466 --> 12:12.084
It's like ordering
a hooker in Vegas.

12:13.387 --> 12:15.003
Pretty smart
for a bunch of stoners.

12:15.005 --> 12:17.889
These kids are the future
leaders of America, pal.

12:17.891 --> 12:19.624
Yeah, that's a
scary thought.

12:21.177 --> 12:22.177
Showtime.

12:22.179 --> 12:23.678
Hey.

12:23.680 --> 12:26.131
You got
something for me?

12:27.800 --> 12:29.484
It's 40 bucks
a hit, right?

12:29.486 --> 12:30.485
Yeah, 40 bucks.

12:30.487 --> 12:31.937
That's a drug dealer?

12:31.939 --> 12:33.572
She looks like she's 14.
They didn't make drug dealers

12:33.574 --> 12:34.990
like that when I was a kid.

12:34.992 --> 12:36.491
When was that, in the '50s?

12:38.494 --> 12:41.613
Let's not make a move until
she's clear of my partner, okay?

12:41.615 --> 12:42.697
What'd I...?

12:42.699 --> 12:43.915
Hey!

12:43.917 --> 12:45.867
Police. Don't move.
Put your hands up.

12:45.869 --> 12:47.202
You okay, Kate?
Yeah.

12:52.708 --> 12:54.509
Get off.

12:54.511 --> 12:56.678
You guys
kind of jumped the gun, huh?

12:56.680 --> 12:59.264
He jumped the gun.
I didn't jump anything.

12:59.266 --> 13:01.466
Spook them a little,
they always run.

13:01.468 --> 13:04.886
Now we got our girl for
dealing and resisting arrest.

13:04.888 --> 13:06.555
I love this job.

13:24.176 --> 13:25.560
You look like you had
a long night.

13:25.562 --> 13:27.278
This is all a
big mistake.

13:27.280 --> 13:29.697
You've made
a big mistake, Kelsey.

13:29.699 --> 13:32.567
The pills that you sold me--
the oxy we found in your bag--

13:32.569 --> 13:34.068
you're looking
at real time.

13:35.404 --> 13:38.289
You obviously come
from a good family.

13:38.291 --> 13:39.574
What were you thinking?

13:40.876 --> 13:44.579
That school costs
nearly 60 grand a year.

13:44.581 --> 13:48.132
My parents
can't cover it.

13:48.134 --> 13:50.301
Where am I supposed to
get that kind of money?

13:50.303 --> 13:52.253
Get a damn paper route.

13:54.506 --> 13:58.042
You're in a lot of trouble,
but you can help yourself.

14:00.262 --> 14:01.813
How?

14:01.815 --> 14:03.547
For starters,
you can tell me

14:03.549 --> 14:05.683
what you know
about Connor Riley's death.

14:06.518 --> 14:08.719
Connor was a good guy.

14:10.272 --> 14:14.392
I heard he was selling
to some guy,

14:14.394 --> 14:18.946
it went wrong, and he got shot.

14:18.948 --> 14:20.231
Cut the crap, kid.

14:20.233 --> 14:21.366
He didn't get shot.

14:21.368 --> 14:23.284
He got executed.

14:23.286 --> 14:24.419
It was a message.

14:25.905 --> 14:28.673
Question is, who sent it?

14:28.675 --> 14:29.907
You're a smart girl, Kelsey.

14:29.909 --> 14:34.512
You understand that you could
be dead instead of Connor,

14:34.514 --> 14:37.181
and if you don't help us,
it will be you next time.

14:37.183 --> 14:39.467
Please...

14:39.469 --> 14:42.136
don't make me do this.

14:42.138 --> 14:45.390
Last chance before we dump you
in the system.

14:53.032 --> 14:54.598
It was Otto.

14:56.485 --> 14:58.236
Otto?

14:58.238 --> 14:59.603
Otto Jackson?

15:00.706 --> 15:02.907
Kate, come here for a second.

15:06.445 --> 15:09.247
Otto Jackson's a big-time
distributor out of Harlem.

15:09.249 --> 15:10.965
Looks like he's making
a move downtown.

15:10.967 --> 15:11.916
I know Otto.

15:11.918 --> 15:13.284
How the hell do
you know Otto?

15:13.286 --> 15:15.253
He wore a wire for me
before, okay?

15:15.255 --> 15:16.504
Can you...?

15:18.057 --> 15:21.342
This guy Otto-- you get
your stuff off of him?

15:21.344 --> 15:23.895
All the dealers on campus do.

15:23.897 --> 15:24.929
Connor, too.

15:24.931 --> 15:26.180
So what went wrong?

15:26.182 --> 15:28.966
Otto jacked up his prices.

15:28.968 --> 15:32.987
Connor was pissed.
We all were.

15:32.989 --> 15:35.189
Connor said he was going
to buy somewhere else.

15:35.191 --> 15:36.824
Kid had balls.

15:36.826 --> 15:39.744
Yeah, unfortunately,
they just got him killed.

15:39.746 --> 15:42.029
Let's go pay a visit to Otto.

15:42.031 --> 15:43.481
You sit tight.

15:43.483 --> 15:45.483
I'm not sure
that's going to work, Ed.

15:45.485 --> 15:47.752
We discussed the spike
in gang-related shootings

15:47.754 --> 15:48.753
in that area.

15:48.755 --> 15:51.172
Yes, sir, I allocated more men.

15:51.174 --> 15:53.591
We should probably look
at the ripple effect

15:53.593 --> 15:54.592
of the tour changes.

15:54.594 --> 15:56.177
Your 3:00 is here.

15:56.179 --> 15:57.929
I don't have a 3:00.

15:57.931 --> 16:02.383
Your 3:00 is here
in the conference room.

16:08.941 --> 16:10.841
Excuse me, Ed.

16:23.155 --> 16:24.572
I don't have much time.

16:25.491 --> 16:28.526
I skipped study hall--
with permission--

16:28.528 --> 16:31.295
and took the subway.

16:31.297 --> 16:32.747
Here's my hall pass.

16:34.883 --> 16:37.168
And I've got to get back
for Mom picking me up.

16:42.925 --> 16:45.676
This is important
to you, isn't it?

16:45.678 --> 16:48.346
Yeah, but probably not
for the reasons you think.

16:49.765 --> 16:53.067
Look, I know Mom's trying
to get you to take her side,

16:53.069 --> 16:56.654
but before you do, I think
I deserve a fair hearing.

16:56.656 --> 16:58.406
Okay.

16:58.408 --> 17:00.358
You've known me since
the day I was born.

17:00.360 --> 17:03.778
Have I not toed every line
that's ever been drawn for me?

17:03.780 --> 17:06.113
And do you really
think that,

17:06.115 --> 17:07.865
just because I'm on
a college campus,

17:07.867 --> 17:10.167
I'm gonna morph into a
completely different person

17:10.170 --> 17:12.903
and start drinking
and doing drugs?

17:12.905 --> 17:15.623
I mean, have I ever
made a stupid choice

17:15.625 --> 17:16.958
that put me in danger

17:16.960 --> 17:20.178
or went against Mom's wishes
in any significant way?

17:20.180 --> 17:22.380
I don't think so.

17:24.299 --> 17:27.018
But it is still
your mother's decision.

17:27.020 --> 17:29.587
I get that.

17:29.589 --> 17:32.440
But you got to put
yourself in my shoes.

17:32.442 --> 17:34.525
I follow all the rules.

17:34.527 --> 17:36.260
I'm the kid-- all my
friends' parents say,

17:36.262 --> 17:38.980
"Why can't you be more like
that Nicky Reagan-Boyle""

17:44.119 --> 17:48.990
I'm thinking this is about more
than just a party.

17:48.992 --> 17:50.791
It is.

17:50.793 --> 17:54.962
It's about trust,
and I've earned some.

17:55.898 --> 17:57.715
I got to go.

17:58.717 --> 17:59.834
Good talk.

18:14.566 --> 18:16.400
All right, Otto Jackson
runs the whole building.

18:16.402 --> 18:17.902
Narcotics collared
this scumbag before.

18:17.904 --> 18:19.320
Took a firefight
to get him out.

18:19.322 --> 18:22.607
Which we'd like to avoid
happening this time, okay?

18:22.609 --> 18:24.158
Keep your radios on,
watch your back.

18:24.160 --> 18:25.610
We want to get this guy alive,

18:25.612 --> 18:27.328
so don't fire
unless you have to.

18:27.330 --> 18:28.696
On your call.

18:28.698 --> 18:30.748
Open it!

18:52.170 --> 18:53.471
There's only one guard.

19:15.494 --> 19:17.411
Let's let him know
we're here, right?

19:17.413 --> 19:18.496
Yeah.

19:18.498 --> 19:20.214
Whoa... you're gonna
give him a heads-up?

19:20.216 --> 19:22.833
He's probably got
a damn rocket launcher.

19:22.835 --> 19:24.251
Use your head--
the guy knows me.

19:24.253 --> 19:26.470
Let's go by the book,
and give him a chance

19:26.472 --> 19:27.638
to come out peacefully.

19:29.641 --> 19:32.259
Otto Jackson!

19:34.896 --> 19:37.565
Attention, team, shots fired.

19:37.567 --> 19:39.150
Attention, team,
shots fired.

19:39.152 --> 19:40.384
Police!

19:43.488 --> 19:44.605
Go, go!

19:44.607 --> 19:46.023
Go, go, go!

19:46.025 --> 19:47.775
Go! Go!

19:51.830 --> 19:54.064
Otto!

19:54.066 --> 19:56.467
Roger, black light.
Otto Jackson!

19:56.469 --> 19:58.736
Hold your fire!

19:58.738 --> 20:01.288
I'm coming out,
and I'm unarmed.

20:01.290 --> 20:03.457
Hold your fire!

20:06.244 --> 20:08.295
Get your hands
where I can see them, Otto.

20:08.297 --> 20:11.465
Pick it up!

20:11.467 --> 20:12.416
Drop the hat.

20:12.418 --> 20:16.220
Walk forward
slowly.

20:16.222 --> 20:18.389
Reagan.

20:19.257 --> 20:21.058
Why you busting up
my place, Reagan?

20:21.060 --> 20:23.194
Get on your knees now!

20:24.697 --> 20:27.431
You could've just knocked.

20:27.433 --> 20:28.599
Cuff him.

20:28.601 --> 20:30.151
Hands behind
your back.

20:31.987 --> 20:33.437
Hey, hey!

20:33.439 --> 20:34.739
I'm talking to you.

20:34.741 --> 20:36.574
You want to do this?
Danny.

20:36.576 --> 20:37.742
The only thing
I want to do

20:37.744 --> 20:38.793
is get you off this case.

20:38.795 --> 20:40.778
This was the only way
to take this guy down.

20:40.780 --> 20:43.214
And you just
got a cop shot.

20:43.216 --> 20:45.800
I'm done with you.

20:59.898 --> 21:01.599
Job was a 10-10

21:01.601 --> 21:03.851
robbery and assault--
did you see anything?

21:10.193 --> 21:12.159
Over here.

21:12.161 --> 21:15.813
Hey.
You okay, ma'am?

21:15.815 --> 21:18.148
It was a couple of boys.

21:18.150 --> 21:19.784
They pushed me down.

21:19.786 --> 21:21.168
Are you hurt?

21:21.170 --> 21:24.922
No, but you should
check on the lady.

21:24.924 --> 21:26.507
What lady is that?

21:36.301 --> 21:37.551
Call a bus.

21:37.553 --> 21:38.769
Charlie to Central.

21:38.771 --> 21:40.221
We need a bus
at this location.

21:40.223 --> 21:42.022
Dana, Dana, Dana!

21:42.024 --> 21:43.858
Are you okay?
How bad are you hurt?

21:43.860 --> 21:45.810
I gave them the supplies,
but they wouldn't stop.

21:45.812 --> 21:49.313
They just kept punching
me and kicking me and...

21:49.315 --> 21:50.898
Where-where's Arnie?
Where's Arnie?

21:50.900 --> 21:52.182
He couldn't make
it tonight.

21:52.184 --> 21:55.653
I... I gave them
the stuff, but...

21:55.655 --> 21:59.189
they didn't have
to hurt me.

21:59.191 --> 22:01.125
Okay.

22:01.127 --> 22:03.794
Nobody's gonna
hurt you anymore.

22:03.796 --> 22:05.412
I was just
trying to help.

22:16.212 --> 22:18.582
Stone is
a highly-decorated detective.

22:19.078 --> 22:21.128
Made a lot of cases for OCCB.

22:21.130 --> 22:22.380
So what?

22:22.405 --> 22:24.332
So he's got a lot
of friends in that bureau.

22:24.333 --> 22:26.667
Pulling him off
might make some major waves.

22:26.669 --> 22:28.302
Might even land
on a commissioner's desk.

22:28.304 --> 22:29.720
Great. So let it.

22:29.722 --> 22:31.055
Yeah?
Yeah!

22:31.057 --> 22:33.090
Don't you forget you put
your hands on this guy,

22:33.092 --> 22:35.626
Reagan, in front
of a room full of cops.

22:35.628 --> 22:38.396
You want to take a chance
this blows up in your face?

22:39.798 --> 22:41.265
Okay, so what are we
supposed to do?

22:41.267 --> 22:44.635
Nail Otto Jackson
for killing Connor Riley.

22:44.637 --> 22:47.405
You make this case,
you're done dealing with Stone.

22:47.407 --> 22:49.607
Thanks, boss.

22:57.148 --> 22:59.750
Hey.

23:01.703 --> 23:03.087
How are you doing?

23:03.089 --> 23:06.924
Please, don't say,
"I told you so."

23:08.993 --> 23:11.095
No, I'm just glad
you're okay.

23:11.097 --> 23:13.047
Thanks for the flowers.

23:13.049 --> 23:15.633
I still can't believe
it happened.

23:15.635 --> 23:18.219
I mean... the stuff
that they took--

23:18.221 --> 23:19.670
it wasn't worth anything.

23:19.672 --> 23:21.222
Guys like this--
they're animals.

23:21.224 --> 23:23.274
They don't care who they hurt.

23:23.276 --> 23:25.443
Unfortunately, you got caught
in the middle of it.

23:26.845 --> 23:28.345
While it was happening,

23:28.347 --> 23:31.282
I didn't know
what they were going to do.

23:31.284 --> 23:33.484
Rape me, kill me.

23:35.403 --> 23:37.738
I've never felt powerless
like that before.

23:37.740 --> 23:40.074
It'll take some time,
but you'll get past this.

23:40.076 --> 23:42.209
Okay?

23:42.211 --> 23:44.962
We got a good description of
the guys from Margaret Porter,

23:44.964 --> 23:46.330
the homeless woman.

23:46.332 --> 23:48.082
I want you to take
a look at these.

23:51.336 --> 23:55.139
I-I'm sorry.
Can we do this later?

23:55.974 --> 23:59.209
Absolutely. Yeah.

23:59.211 --> 24:01.545
No problem.

24:01.547 --> 24:03.481
Okay.

24:04.316 --> 24:06.550
I guess it's all my fault.

24:06.552 --> 24:07.935
No.

24:07.937 --> 24:10.437
You were out there
trying to do some good.

24:13.108 --> 24:15.910
Get some rest, okay?

24:23.952 --> 24:26.420
Hey, like I said,

24:26.422 --> 24:28.172
I ain't killed no college kid.

24:28.174 --> 24:30.073
Right. Come on, Uncle Otto.
You know me.

24:30.075 --> 24:32.092
Hey, you know
you're not leaving this room

24:32.094 --> 24:34.178
until I get the truth
out of you.

24:34.180 --> 24:35.763
I was up in Slam all night.

24:35.765 --> 24:37.264
Everybody saw me.

24:37.266 --> 24:38.265
Slam?

24:38.267 --> 24:40.935
The hottest club in Harlem.

24:40.937 --> 24:43.253
You should stop by some time.

24:43.255 --> 24:44.972
There's a lot
of pretty white girls up there.

24:44.974 --> 24:47.474
Oh, yeah, sure. Let me know
when hell freezes over.

24:47.476 --> 24:48.642
Oh.

24:48.644 --> 24:51.061
Thanks for the heads-up.

24:51.063 --> 24:54.532
Hey. Don't mention it.

24:55.784 --> 24:58.769
We figured you'd just come in
with guns blazing like usual.

24:58.771 --> 25:00.487
All right, Otto,
I think it's time

25:00.489 --> 25:02.105
you stop BSing and just tell us

25:02.107 --> 25:03.958
when you started supplying
the campus, okay?

25:03.960 --> 25:05.543
Please.

25:05.545 --> 25:07.578
Come on. One of your dealers
told us, okay?

25:07.580 --> 25:08.712
They told us everything.

25:08.714 --> 25:10.047
They told us you got greedy

25:10.049 --> 25:11.832
and started raising your prices,
so stop BSing.

25:11.834 --> 25:14.635
Look, you got it all wrong.

25:14.637 --> 25:15.886
Really?

25:15.888 --> 25:17.555
That kid that got hit?
Uh-huh?

25:17.557 --> 25:19.139
He reached out to me.

25:19.141 --> 25:20.758
So you admit you know him?

25:20.760 --> 25:23.761
Yeah. I talked to him
the day he got shot.

25:23.763 --> 25:26.430
Said he was pissed
about the prices he was paying.

25:26.432 --> 25:28.682
Asked me to help him out.

25:28.684 --> 25:30.734
I said we could do business.

25:30.736 --> 25:33.354
I took off.

25:33.356 --> 25:34.855
And he was still alive.

25:35.991 --> 25:37.825
And you expect us
to believe this?

25:37.827 --> 25:41.311
Detective, you got
a dead white kid on your hands.

25:41.313 --> 25:45.482
You need somebody to bust,
so you come to old Otto.

25:45.484 --> 25:46.817
Right, so you're telling us

25:46.819 --> 25:49.003
that someone else is running
the drug trade on campus?

25:49.005 --> 25:52.289
Yeah. Some white dude.

25:53.658 --> 25:56.794
Call him Ghost
'cause no one ever sees him.

25:57.996 --> 26:00.130
I tried to muscle in
on his turf.

26:00.132 --> 26:01.849
He got the kids scared straight.

26:01.851 --> 26:03.384
Except Connor Riley.

26:03.386 --> 26:06.437
Hey, dude must have heard
that we was talking,

26:06.439 --> 26:08.439
got pissed.

26:08.441 --> 26:11.392
Pah! Took the kid out.

26:14.396 --> 26:17.564
You know, you used to be
a better liar, Otto.

26:20.285 --> 26:22.202
Look, Reagan,

26:22.204 --> 26:25.322
I am not going down
for something I did not do.

26:25.324 --> 26:27.491
No way.

26:37.469 --> 26:40.054
Hey.

26:40.872 --> 26:42.306
Wow.

26:42.308 --> 26:44.008
You're officially
never coming to my place.

26:59.190 --> 27:00.691
Feeling any better?

27:00.693 --> 27:04.078
Yeah. It's good to be home.

27:05.563 --> 27:08.231
If I lived in a place
like this, I would never leave.

27:08.233 --> 27:11.251
You could live like
this if you wanted to.

27:11.253 --> 27:13.454
I like nice things.

27:13.456 --> 27:16.423
Just can't live
with what it takes to get them.

27:16.425 --> 27:18.842
Like the things I do?

27:18.844 --> 27:20.427
No, I didn't mean it like that.

27:20.429 --> 27:22.212
I just meant, I'm not cut out

27:22.214 --> 27:24.081
for life
at a high-powered law firm.

27:24.083 --> 27:25.799
Your heart's too pure?

27:25.801 --> 27:27.685
Dana.

27:27.687 --> 27:30.771
I told you,
I think what you do is great.

27:30.773 --> 27:33.474
And maybe I'm not
saving lives every day.

27:33.476 --> 27:35.976
I have no problem
with how you make a living.

27:35.978 --> 27:37.861
But you don't respect it?

27:39.097 --> 27:40.698
If I said the wrong thing,
I'm sorry.

27:40.700 --> 27:44.568
Back in law school,
you used to talk

27:44.570 --> 27:47.988
about getting away
from the family business.

27:47.990 --> 27:49.106
But here you are.

27:49.108 --> 27:51.792
Well, I've changed
a lot since then.

27:51.794 --> 27:54.128
I thought you got that.

27:54.130 --> 27:56.046
I thought I did, too,

27:56.048 --> 27:58.949
and then I got a close-up look
at the world you work in.

27:58.951 --> 28:01.301
The ugliness, the violence.

28:01.303 --> 28:03.620
You have every right
to be upset.

28:03.622 --> 28:05.622
What you went through
was terrible.

28:05.624 --> 28:08.675
I thought
that I could help people,

28:08.677 --> 28:10.677
make a difference.

28:10.679 --> 28:12.129
Aren't you ever worried

28:12.131 --> 28:14.398
about what could happen
to you out there?

28:14.400 --> 28:17.518
It's part of the job.

28:19.487 --> 28:23.357
I remember at school
when your brother was killed

28:23.359 --> 28:25.943
how devastated
you were.

28:25.945 --> 28:29.279
Is that what this is about?

28:29.281 --> 28:31.815
Proving that
you're a real Reagan?

28:39.007 --> 28:41.208
If you recall anything else
about the incident,

28:41.210 --> 28:42.926
you should call the precinct.

28:50.002 --> 28:51.501
Otto's got to be our guy.

28:51.503 --> 28:52.669
I don't think so.

28:52.671 --> 28:54.471
He admits he met
with Connor Riley

28:54.473 --> 28:56.173
a few hours
before he got hit.

28:56.175 --> 28:57.808
I understand that,
but I know Otto.

28:57.810 --> 29:01.011
Look, if he offed that kid,
he wouldn't say a word to us.

29:01.013 --> 29:02.980
He'd just lawyer up.

29:05.201 --> 29:07.117
What the hell do you want?

29:07.119 --> 29:10.070
Not bad for a
homicide hump.

29:10.072 --> 29:12.072
Lab ran the pills
the girl sold

29:12.074 --> 29:14.458
to your partner before
we took her down.

29:14.460 --> 29:17.194
They trace back to a
cartel in Guadalajara.

29:17.196 --> 29:18.495
So?

29:18.497 --> 29:20.164
Otto gets his drugs
from Durango.

29:20.166 --> 29:22.416
Okay, he's got
a different supplier. So what?

29:22.418 --> 29:24.301
It doesn't work
like that, player.

29:25.370 --> 29:27.554
Otto deals exclusively
with Durango.

29:27.556 --> 29:28.722
He goes shopping around,

29:28.724 --> 29:30.557
he ends up dead
like Connor Riley.

29:30.559 --> 29:33.343
Which means, for once,
you're right, Reagan.

29:33.345 --> 29:34.928
Otto's not our guy.

29:34.930 --> 29:36.814
Oh. I was right, huh?

29:36.816 --> 29:38.849
Well, thanks... player.

29:38.851 --> 29:41.068
Look, I'd rather catch one
in the throat

29:41.070 --> 29:42.385
than work with you two.

29:42.387 --> 29:43.720
But we still have

29:43.722 --> 29:45.355
a murdering drug dealer
out there,

29:45.357 --> 29:48.558
so, with you or without you,
I'm going to nail him.

29:52.730 --> 29:55.115
Would you remind me
not to kill him,

29:55.117 --> 29:56.617
please?

30:09.396 --> 30:11.482
So, Nicky, about this party.

30:11.483 --> 30:12.616
Oh, Pop.

30:12.618 --> 30:13.750
Are you going tomorrow night?

30:13.752 --> 30:15.652
It's up to Mom.

30:15.654 --> 30:17.954
Hey, what's for dessert?

30:17.956 --> 30:19.372
Apple pie.

30:19.374 --> 30:20.674
Now we're talking.

30:20.676 --> 30:22.359
You actually gonna
let your daughter

30:22.361 --> 30:23.877
go out with
a college guy?

30:23.879 --> 30:26.129
I mean, don't you think
you're moving a little fast?

30:26.131 --> 30:27.464
Greg's really sweet.

30:27.466 --> 30:28.548
He's 19.

30:28.550 --> 30:30.517
Is it even legal
for Nicky to date him?

30:30.519 --> 30:32.835
Legal, yes. Sane, no.

30:32.837 --> 30:34.604
Though, technically,
as long as he doesn't

30:34.606 --> 30:37.107
drive her across state lines,
she can go out with him.

30:37.109 --> 30:39.309
If she was still 15,
it'd be a Class A misdemeanor.

30:39.311 --> 30:40.393
But only if we had sex.

30:40.395 --> 30:42.345
Whoa! Come on!

30:42.347 --> 30:44.447
Welcome to my world.

30:44.449 --> 30:45.565
Boys, I think it's time

30:45.567 --> 30:47.450
that you go and play
some video games.

30:47.452 --> 30:48.735
Why do we have to leave?

30:48.737 --> 30:49.953
Because they're gonna
talk about sex.

30:49.955 --> 30:50.954
Hey!

30:50.956 --> 30:52.021
I'll explain it
to you later.

30:52.023 --> 30:53.290
Oh, my God.

30:53.292 --> 30:55.625
Give me this.
Go play video games.

30:57.695 --> 30:59.663
Go!

30:59.665 --> 31:00.664
Sorry.

31:00.666 --> 31:01.581
It's okay.

31:01.583 --> 31:02.716
For the record,

31:02.718 --> 31:04.634
I have no intentions
of sleeping with this guy.

31:04.636 --> 31:07.254
It's not your intentions
we're worried about.

31:07.256 --> 31:08.555
Right, Dad?

31:08.557 --> 31:10.840
Well, sure.

31:10.842 --> 31:13.876
But I think Nicky's a
pretty good judge of character.

31:14.712 --> 31:15.979
Thank you.

31:15.981 --> 31:18.315
At the same time, Nicky,
your mom has a point.

31:18.317 --> 31:19.849
Um, you're
asking her

31:19.851 --> 31:21.184
to trust a guy
she's never met.

31:21.186 --> 31:22.218
Exactly.

31:22.220 --> 31:23.853
Amen to that.

31:23.855 --> 31:25.989
Nicky is too young
for a college guy.

31:25.991 --> 31:27.691
Thank you.

31:27.693 --> 31:30.059
Hey, I was a college guy once.
I was a perfect gentleman.

31:30.061 --> 31:32.078
Come on. You're a choir boy.

31:32.080 --> 31:33.663
But the rest of us
sowed our wild oats

31:33.665 --> 31:35.398
pretty good when we were kids,

31:35.400 --> 31:36.583
especially you, sis.

31:36.585 --> 31:38.168
Danny, we have two boys.
It's different.

31:38.170 --> 31:39.786
Look, it's just...
I'm... I'm just saying.

31:39.788 --> 31:41.254
Who's ready for some apple pie?

31:41.256 --> 31:43.873
Actually, I'd like to hear more
about Mama's wild oats.

31:43.875 --> 31:47.711
If your uncle values his
life, you never will.

31:47.713 --> 31:49.095
You and Mom seemed
to have a pretty good system

31:49.097 --> 31:50.263
for raising us up, Dad.

31:50.265 --> 31:51.798
Well, it wasn't really a system.

31:51.800 --> 31:55.852
We just believed in letting you
all live your own lives.

31:55.854 --> 31:57.554
For the most
part, and...

31:57.556 --> 32:00.089
if you look around the table,
it turned out pretty well.

32:00.091 --> 32:02.058
Meaning you think I should
let her go to the party?

32:02.060 --> 32:04.728
I didn't say that,
and it's not my call.

32:04.730 --> 32:08.198
Okay, but if it were,
you wouldn't let her go, right?

32:11.969 --> 32:13.620
Right?

32:21.579 --> 32:23.380
I have always believed

32:23.382 --> 32:27.500
in rewarding responsibility
with trust.

32:27.502 --> 32:29.919
Nicky is a responsible person.

32:31.138 --> 32:34.057
I think she has earned
the benefit of the doubt.

32:34.059 --> 32:35.058
Ah, Francis.

32:35.060 --> 32:36.226
Seriously?

32:36.228 --> 32:37.060
Yeah.

32:37.062 --> 32:38.428
Thank you, Grandpa.

32:38.430 --> 32:40.730
Don't thank me.
It's still your mom's decision.

32:47.805 --> 32:49.739
Fine. Go.

32:49.741 --> 32:51.408
Get drunk.
Have sex with Greg.

32:51.410 --> 32:52.475
Get a tattoo.

32:52.477 --> 32:54.110
You need bail money,
call your grandfather.

32:54.112 --> 32:56.663
Thank you so much
for backing me up.

33:11.929 --> 33:13.513
What are you guys
doing here?

33:13.515 --> 33:15.348
What's your
major, Kelsey?

33:15.350 --> 33:16.716
Advertising.

33:16.718 --> 33:18.351
Well, you definitely
have a flair

33:18.353 --> 33:19.502
for lying through your teeth.

33:19.504 --> 33:21.003
What are you talking about?

33:21.005 --> 33:23.773
You fed us the line
about Otto being your supplier.

33:23.775 --> 33:25.007
Which is called

33:25.009 --> 33:26.142
hindering prosecution,

33:26.144 --> 33:27.977
also known as a felony, Kelsey.

33:27.979 --> 33:29.178
Add that

33:29.180 --> 33:30.563
to your list of charges,

33:30.565 --> 33:32.148
you won't see graduation.

33:33.567 --> 33:36.036
You do understand that
you only made bail because

33:36.038 --> 33:38.822
we put in a good word for you
with the ADA, right?

33:38.824 --> 33:40.623
Look...

33:40.625 --> 33:42.909
I had no choice, okay?

33:42.911 --> 33:44.411
He made me lie to you.

33:44.413 --> 33:46.046
Who?

33:47.631 --> 33:49.299
Who is <i>he,</i> Kelsey?

33:55.539 --> 33:58.541
You really want to take
a trip to lady jail?

33:59.677 --> 34:01.878
Okay, wait.

34:04.231 --> 34:07.717
His name is Brian Devlin.

34:07.719 --> 34:09.652
Professor Devlin?

34:09.654 --> 34:13.156
The guy that I.D.'d
Otto's SUV for us?

34:13.158 --> 34:15.324
Are you telling me
a professor is selling drugs

34:15.327 --> 34:17.193
on a college campus?
I mean...

34:17.195 --> 34:18.393
Come on, Kelsey,
why the hell

34:18.396 --> 34:19.746
would a college professor
be selling drugs?

34:19.748 --> 34:22.364
Do you have any idea
what they pay those guys?

34:22.367 --> 34:23.666
It's a joke.

34:23.668 --> 34:26.536
So the professor
had someone take out Connor

34:26.538 --> 34:28.371
'cause he was trying
to buy from Otto?

34:28.373 --> 34:30.873
He figured
he could put the word out

34:30.876 --> 34:33.242
that this is his turf...

34:33.244 --> 34:36.963
and let you guys take out his
main competition in the process.

34:36.965 --> 34:40.766
So Professor Devlin sniffed
out our little sting,

34:40.768 --> 34:42.469
sent you along
to get pinched

34:42.471 --> 34:44.587
so you could guide us to
Otto-- was that his plan?

34:44.589 --> 34:45.922
Yeah.

34:45.924 --> 34:47.857
Oh.

34:47.859 --> 34:49.257
It's kind of good.

34:50.728 --> 34:52.896
He's a genius.

34:52.898 --> 34:56.399
And a total freak.

34:56.400 --> 34:59.285
And if he finds out
I told the truth...

35:01.104 --> 35:03.272
...I'm dead.

35:03.274 --> 35:05.992
What do you say we stick
this egghead in the box,

35:05.994 --> 35:07.710
sweat him till
he gives it up?

35:07.712 --> 35:09.746
Come on, Stone, you know
Devlin's too smart for that.

35:09.748 --> 35:11.181
He's gonna lawyer up,
and with what

35:11.183 --> 35:12.749
we got on him now,
he's gonna walk.

35:12.751 --> 35:13.883
We're not gonna
find anything

35:13.885 --> 35:15.301
in his computer
or at his place.

35:15.303 --> 35:16.753
No, we're not.

35:16.755 --> 35:18.621
Look, if we're gonna get
him on murdering Connor,

35:18.623 --> 35:20.089
then we're gonna
have to get inside

35:20.091 --> 35:21.224
his drug business
somehow.

35:21.226 --> 35:22.759
I like
the sound of that.

35:22.761 --> 35:24.093
What, are we
cooperating now?

35:24.095 --> 35:25.762
Take it easy.

35:25.764 --> 35:26.930
Look, didn't you
pinpoint the source

35:26.932 --> 35:28.631
of his supplier in Mexico?
Yeah.

35:28.633 --> 35:30.600
All right, well, he's
gonna have to get in touch

35:30.602 --> 35:31.935
with him at some
point, isn't he?

35:31.937 --> 35:33.670
The DEA tracks
those shipments, right?

35:33.672 --> 35:35.989
Yeah, I've been keeping them
up to date on our investigation.

35:35.991 --> 35:38.641
I'll see if they got a line on the
next load coming out of Durango.

35:38.694 --> 35:41.395
Great. Then we'll hope whoever
Devlin sends to pick it up

35:41.446 --> 35:43.079
isn't as smart as he is.

35:43.081 --> 35:45.147
So, what are you
doing tonight?

35:45.149 --> 35:48.150
A couple of buddies from Jersey
are meeting me downtown

35:48.152 --> 35:49.452
for a beer--
you're welcome to join.

35:49.454 --> 35:51.254
Oh, sounds good,
but I think

35:51.256 --> 35:53.489
I'm gonna make it an
early night tonight.

35:53.491 --> 35:54.691
All right.

35:54.693 --> 35:57.677
We'll see about that.

35:57.679 --> 36:00.663
I'll catch
you kids later.

36:00.665 --> 36:02.498
Hey.

36:03.717 --> 36:06.669
Got a second
for a penitent superhero?

36:07.838 --> 36:10.640
I'm sorry about what I said.

36:10.642 --> 36:12.487
Especially about your brother.
I had no right...

36:12.512 --> 36:13.360
It's okay.

36:13.361 --> 36:16.512
No, it's really not.

36:16.514 --> 36:20.016
I respect what you do, Jamie,
the courage it takes.

36:20.018 --> 36:21.901
I just don't want anything
to happen to you.

36:21.903 --> 36:25.705
Yeah, that
makes two of us.

36:26.540 --> 36:28.908
So... you heading home?

36:28.910 --> 36:32.328
Yeah, I was gonna get a bite
at this dive near my place.

36:32.330 --> 36:34.430
I'd invite you, but
it's kind of a dump.

36:34.432 --> 36:35.882
Well...

36:35.884 --> 36:39.552
luckily, I have
a cop to protect me.

36:41.388 --> 36:43.590
Okay.

36:46.343 --> 36:49.262
Intel tracked the van
from Durango.

36:49.264 --> 36:51.014
My team got a warrant,

36:51.016 --> 36:52.882
took a peek inside.

36:52.884 --> 36:54.383
It's loaded.

36:54.385 --> 36:55.935
Pot, pills,

36:55.937 --> 36:56.886
the whole enchilada.

36:56.888 --> 36:58.104
Well, I don't think Devlin

36:58.106 --> 36:59.739
is gonna be doing
the pickup himself.

36:59.741 --> 37:01.157
You're good, Reagan.

37:01.159 --> 37:03.610
But we've
seen this before.

37:03.612 --> 37:06.112
Cartel mails a set of keys
to the supplier,

37:06.114 --> 37:07.897
sends the load up
with the courier.

37:07.899 --> 37:09.532
Once the van's parked
on the street,

37:09.534 --> 37:11.117
the courier notifies
the supplier,

37:11.119 --> 37:12.785
who sends someone
to pick up the van.

37:12.787 --> 37:14.287
So we nail the driver
and get him

37:14.289 --> 37:15.404
to roll over on Devlin.

37:15.406 --> 37:17.507
That's the general idea.

37:19.009 --> 37:21.210
Hold on.

37:23.080 --> 37:24.547
Looks like it could be our guy.

37:24.549 --> 37:25.715
Okay, let's go.

37:25.717 --> 37:27.600
Hey, whoa.

37:27.602 --> 37:30.219
We got to get him transporting
the drugs to make it stick.

37:30.221 --> 37:32.689
Suddenly you want to take
your time with something, huh?

37:35.025 --> 37:37.060
Let's not let him
get too far, okay?

37:39.262 --> 37:42.148
Well, something tells me

37:42.150 --> 37:43.900
he's not getting too far.

37:43.902 --> 37:45.368
Is that a kill switch?

37:45.370 --> 37:47.269
TARU installed it.

37:47.271 --> 37:51.374
Push this button, and
the engine goes bye-bye.

37:51.376 --> 37:55.411
I think I see
a motorist in distress.

38:01.885 --> 38:03.886
Come on.

38:07.509 --> 38:10.059
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on.

38:10.061 --> 38:11.978
Trouble with your vehicle, sir?

38:11.980 --> 38:14.130
No, thanks, I'm fine.
Give me a minute.

38:14.132 --> 38:16.849
When's the last time you had a tune up?
You don't want to flood the engine, right?

38:16.851 --> 38:18.601
I'm sorry. Give me a second.

38:18.603 --> 38:20.486
Is this your van, sir?

38:20.488 --> 38:21.938
Uh, no, no, I drive it
for this guy.

38:21.940 --> 38:23.323
Well, tell you what,
how about you hop out

38:23.325 --> 38:24.774
and we'll help give
you a push, okay?

38:24.776 --> 38:26.442
Give me a second.

38:26.444 --> 38:27.476
You're blocking traffic.

38:27.478 --> 38:29.112
Put it in neutral
and step out of the car.

38:32.483 --> 38:34.000
There you go.

38:34.002 --> 38:35.702
Come on.

38:35.704 --> 38:37.253
Pretty big load in here.

38:37.255 --> 38:38.671
What do you got there?

38:38.673 --> 38:40.173
You know,
it's just stuff, man.

38:40.175 --> 38:41.323
Just supplies
and stuff.

38:41.325 --> 38:43.176
We're gonna have
to unpack it, right?

38:43.178 --> 38:44.460
No, no, I'll do that.

38:44.462 --> 38:45.962
I don't want to impose
on you guys.

38:45.964 --> 38:47.380
You guys are busy.
No, no.

38:47.382 --> 38:50.850
We're never too busy
for Brian Devlin's guy.

38:50.852 --> 38:52.802
Yeah, that's right.

38:52.804 --> 38:55.304
He said you're the brains
behind the whole operation,

38:55.306 --> 38:57.840
and it was your car
that killed Connor Riley.

38:57.842 --> 38:59.976
Listen, I...

38:59.978 --> 39:01.677
I just move the stuff,

39:01.679 --> 39:02.945
make sure that the
dealers are in line.

39:02.947 --> 39:04.447
Sure.
Devlin... Devlin calls the shots.

39:04.449 --> 39:06.015
I'm just... He's the boss.
I'm not the boss.

39:06.017 --> 39:08.618
You know what, you can tell
us about it down at the squad.

39:08.620 --> 39:09.869
Come on!

39:11.455 --> 39:13.489
Evening, Professor.

39:13.491 --> 39:15.024
How's the book coming?

39:15.826 --> 39:17.359
Wait till the boys
down at Rikers

39:17.361 --> 39:18.961
get a load
of those elbow patches.

39:18.963 --> 39:21.330
We're gonna have to take that
off your hands now, Professor.

39:21.332 --> 39:24.083
You're under arrest
for distribution of narcotics.

39:24.085 --> 39:25.501
What?
Yep.

39:25.503 --> 39:27.503
And your associate
also gave you up

39:27.505 --> 39:29.305
for hiring the Dominicans
that took out Connor.

39:29.307 --> 39:31.974
It's homicide
with special circumstances.

39:31.976 --> 39:33.309
Mm-hmm.

39:33.311 --> 39:34.877
I'd like to call my attorney.

39:34.879 --> 39:36.479
Yeah, you do that.
Officers.

39:42.736 --> 39:44.904
You know, not for nothing,

39:44.906 --> 39:47.240
but I hope I never see
your face again,

39:47.242 --> 39:48.908
though we did make
the case together.

39:48.910 --> 39:50.276
And we lived to tell about it.

39:50.278 --> 39:51.393
Mm-hmm.

39:51.395 --> 39:53.162
Surprise, surprise.

39:53.164 --> 39:55.665
You know,
you two ain't so bad, either.

39:56.399 --> 39:59.669
For squad detectives.

40:01.455 --> 40:04.757
Don't go poaching
our collar now.

40:04.759 --> 40:06.759
It's a squad arrest.

40:06.761 --> 40:08.928
In your dreams.

40:19.857 --> 40:21.858
It's five after 12:00.

40:21.860 --> 40:23.726
Well, she was in Manhattan.

40:23.728 --> 40:25.545
That's well
within the margin of error.

40:25.547 --> 40:29.215
I don't remember you being
this anxious when I was 16.

40:29.217 --> 40:30.599
Who said I'm anxious?

40:30.601 --> 40:32.819
You've been standing there
like a statue

40:32.821 --> 40:34.570
for the past 15 minutes.

40:34.572 --> 40:36.372
When you were 16,

40:36.374 --> 40:39.375
I would have been thrilled
if it was only five past 12:00.

40:39.377 --> 40:42.211
Your mom and I must
have stood at this window

40:42.213 --> 40:44.714
100 times waiting
for you to come home.

40:44.716 --> 40:46.749
I don't remember seeing
you guys.

40:46.751 --> 40:48.301
Of course you didn't,

40:48.303 --> 40:50.753
because as soon as we saw
the headlights in the driveway,

40:50.755 --> 40:52.454
we ran upstairs,
got back in bed

40:52.456 --> 40:53.556
and pretended we were asleep.

40:53.558 --> 40:56.142
Dad, you don't need
to exaggerate.

40:56.144 --> 40:58.761
I'm not exaggerating.

40:58.763 --> 41:01.681
One of the few things
we fought over

41:01.683 --> 41:04.133
was whether you took more
after me or her.

41:04.135 --> 41:06.302
I wasn't that bad.

41:06.304 --> 41:07.653
I didn't say you were bad,

41:07.655 --> 41:09.939
but you sure as hell
had one foot out the door

41:09.941 --> 41:11.440
by the time
you were Nicky's age.

41:11.442 --> 41:13.242
You really felt that way?

41:13.244 --> 41:14.694
Yeah, and if there
was a boundary,

41:14.696 --> 41:17.146
you went at it
like an armored division.

41:20.284 --> 41:23.652
Your mom liked to say
that life...

41:23.654 --> 41:27.290
should be a series
of daring adventures

41:27.292 --> 41:29.091
launched from a secure base.

41:29.093 --> 41:31.260
I had to
remind her of that

41:31.262 --> 41:33.679
many times right in this room

41:33.681 --> 41:36.465
on a whole lot
of Saturday nights,

41:36.467 --> 41:38.100
waiting up for you.

41:40.270 --> 41:43.105
Nicky's not much like me,
is she?

41:43.107 --> 41:47.143
She's a whole lot like you
in some ways,

41:47.145 --> 41:50.947
but in terms of maturity
and responsibility,

41:50.949 --> 41:53.349
I think
she was born middle-aged.

41:55.537 --> 41:57.370
Oh.

42:06.881 --> 42:08.247
Hi, honey. In here.

42:08.249 --> 42:09.832
Hey.

42:09.834 --> 42:11.918
I had the most amazing time.

42:11.920 --> 42:13.336
Good.

42:13.338 --> 42:14.503
How amazing?

42:14.505 --> 42:16.422
I met some great people.

42:16.424 --> 42:17.873
Greg was a perfect gentleman.

42:17.875 --> 42:19.592
Thank you so much
for letting me go.

42:19.594 --> 42:22.261
You're welcome.

42:23.397 --> 42:24.647
We would have been home sooner,

42:24.649 --> 42:26.182
but Greg's car got parked in.

42:26.184 --> 42:28.734
Luckily, this super cool
campus cop got us out.

42:28.736 --> 42:29.735
Oh, yeah?

42:29.737 --> 42:31.404
Yeah, and another officer

42:31.406 --> 42:33.389
actually escorted us from
the parking lot to the party.

42:34.324 --> 42:36.392
Wow.

42:36.394 --> 42:38.527
I know.

42:38.529 --> 42:41.113
Well, I am going to bed,

42:41.115 --> 42:42.698
but I love you both.

42:42.700 --> 42:44.450
I love you, too.

42:44.452 --> 42:46.035
I'll be up in a minute.

42:46.037 --> 42:47.920
Good night.

42:53.844 --> 42:57.263
Your retired chief,
Tom Dietrich,

42:57.265 --> 43:00.967
doesn't he head up security
over at that college?

43:00.969 --> 43:03.752
Come to think of it,
I believe he does.

43:05.188 --> 43:08.090
How many officers
did he put on her tonight?

43:08.892 --> 43:11.093
I said three
would probably do it.
