<i>Frying them up in a pa</i> n

00:08.320 --> 00:13.310
<i>Gonna add a little chedda</i> r
<i>'cause l'm a cheesy omelette ma</i> n

00:14.800 --> 00:19.030
-Good morning, Cheesy Omelette Man.
-Good morning, Cheesy Omelette Man.

00:19.080 --> 00:22.230
Good morning,
my loving, beautiful family.

00:22.280 --> 00:24.920
Eggs, bacon.

00:24.960 --> 00:27.070
Either there was a <i>Dukes of Hazzar</i> d
marathon on last night

00:27.120 --> 00:28.680
or you just wrote a new Hannah song!

00:28.720 --> 00:31.360
Honey, you know me better than that.
lf l'd have wrote a new song,

00:31.400 --> 00:33.750
there'd be cinnamon toast.

00:34.640 --> 00:36.950
-New song!
-Cinnamon toast!

00:38.520 --> 00:42.310
There's nothing like finally cracking
a new song, and this one was a bear.

00:42.360 --> 00:45.750
l can't wait to hear it!
Let me go get Lucky Lulu.

00:47.880 --> 00:49.360
Where's Lucky Lulu?

00:49.400 --> 00:52.710
Lulu's like a lot
of older California women.

00:52.760 --> 00:55.590
She's having some work done
on her neck.

00:55.640 --> 01:00.710
That's okay.
We can just use Whammy-bar Wally.

01:00.760 --> 01:02.400
He's wonesome.

01:03.400 --> 01:07.190
Now, honey, you know l never play you
a new song without Lulu.

01:07.240 --> 01:10.590
Especially one that could be
your biggest hit ever.

01:10.640 --> 01:15.150
Biggest hit ever? Okay, you at least got
to tell me what it's about. Breaking up?

01:15.200 --> 01:19.030
Making up? Please don't let it be
another song about my double life.

01:19.080 --> 01:20.960
l mean, you might as well tattoo

01:21.000 --> 01:23.910
''l'm really Miley Stewart''
on my forehead.

01:24.600 --> 01:28.230
Sorry, honey, you'll just have to wait.
Lulu won't be back until Monday,

01:28.280 --> 01:31.910
and l won't be back
until after l jog 5 miles.

01:31.960 --> 01:34.950
Matter of fact, make that 5 and a half.

01:35.760 --> 01:40.070
All right, Daddy, whatever you say.
l'll wait because you want me to.

01:40.120 --> 01:41.600
l love you!

01:43.560 --> 01:47.520
All right, where'd that
bacon-eating hillbilly hide my song?

01:48.080 --> 01:50.720
Did you see how happy he was?
This is great!

01:50.760 --> 01:53.750
Now he'll finally let me have
another party at the house.

01:53.800 --> 01:57.150
Are you joking? Remember
the last time you had a party?

01:57.200 --> 02:01.790
Hey, it was one itty-bitty,
little city-wide power outage.

02:03.000 --> 02:06.040
They had to land a jumbo jet
on the freeway.

02:07.440 --> 02:10.789
And now those passengers
have a great story to tell.

02:13.720 --> 02:14.750
Gotcha!

02:14.800 --> 02:18.150
Look, l've been begging for months
and all l've heard was,

02:18.200 --> 02:21.870
''Can't talk. Got to finish the song.
Can't talk. Got to finish the song.

02:21.920 --> 02:23.510
''Fudgy Buddy.''

02:24.800 --> 02:29.350
Well, he's finished the song,
he's in a great mood, which means...

02:29.400 --> 02:34.070
Max, the party animal is back!
Saturday night, my house!

02:34.120 --> 02:36.150
This is awful.

02:36.200 --> 02:38.710
So, are we smelling a hit?

02:38.760 --> 02:42.230
l'm smelling something,
but l ain't sure it's a hit.

02:43.200 --> 02:44.840
This song stinks.

02:44.880 --> 02:48.390
-Oh, no.
-Yes. Take a whiff.

03:49.040 --> 03:52.470
''He's got a habit of running away

03:54.120 --> 03:58.430
''Hey, honey, where's that bunny?
He took my money, that ain't okay

03:59.880 --> 04:02.550
''Hey, hey, hey, bunnay''

04:05.040 --> 04:07.110
Well, it certainly

04:07.960 --> 04:09.280
rhymes.

04:10.360 --> 04:12.000
-With a good band...
-Good band.

04:12.040 --> 04:14.710
-Some backup vocals...
-Backup vocals.

04:15.640 --> 04:17.390
lt'll still be a song about bunnies!

04:17.440 --> 04:19.269
Which could become an Easter classic.

04:19.320 --> 04:20.880
Classic.

04:20.920 --> 04:24.590
This is horrible. l've never hated
one of his songs before.

04:24.640 --> 04:26.950
-How am l gonna tell him?
-Maybe you won't have to.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.070
l mean, maybe he'll think about it,
realise that it's horrible,

04:30.120 --> 04:32.790
and then fix it
before he shows it to you.

04:32.840 --> 04:34.350
-Hey, everybody!
-Hey, Daddy!

04:34.400 --> 04:35.430
-Hi!
-What up?

04:35.480 --> 04:37.750
-Look at those abs.
-Sir.

04:37.800 --> 04:39.870
So, Daddy, how was your jog?

04:39.920 --> 04:43.070
lt was great! But l keep thinking
about that new song.

04:43.120 --> 04:44.150
Really?

04:44.200 --> 04:46.080
-What song?
-You wrote a song? Who knew?

04:46.120 --> 04:49.750
lnteresting. Easter. lsland.
Easter lsland.

04:49.800 --> 04:51.390
We're studying it at school.

04:51.440 --> 04:54.750
Big statues.
Nobody knows how they got there.

04:54.800 --> 04:55.950
Weird.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.800
Yeah, really weird! So, so strange.

04:59.880 --> 05:01.470
Strange.

05:01.520 --> 05:04.160
l would ask what's going on,
but then you'd tell me,

05:04.200 --> 05:06.030
and why would l want that?

05:06.080 --> 05:08.510
So, Daddy,
you were thinking about the song?

05:08.560 --> 05:13.270
Nothing wrong with that,
just keep on thinking! Please.

05:15.040 --> 05:17.230
Yeah, well, you know
how sometimes you write something

05:17.280 --> 05:19.080
and then you take
another look at it later

05:19.120 --> 05:20.790
and it's not as good as you thought?

05:20.840 --> 05:23.400
-Yeah?
-Well, this ain't one of those times!

05:23.440 --> 05:25.630
lt isn't? Are you sure?

05:26.840 --> 05:29.230
l'm real sure. l mean, this song is great,

05:29.280 --> 05:32.110
and l can't wait to see
the look on your face

05:32.160 --> 05:34.670
when l play it for you on Monday.

05:36.640 --> 05:39.910
-What are you gonna do?
-Stick my head in the freezer.

05:39.960 --> 05:43.870
Please defrost me
when you find a cure for this song.

05:43.920 --> 05:46.560
l will tell you what she's gonna do,
all right?

05:46.600 --> 05:49.870
She's gonna tell him
that she loves it. Why?

05:49.920 --> 05:51.350
Because she's a wonderful daughter

05:51.400 --> 05:53.150
who doesn't want
to break her father's heart.

05:53.200 --> 05:54.600
This is still about your party, right?

05:54.640 --> 05:56.750
Look, Max has already
invited 50 people

05:56.800 --> 05:59.190
and reserved a deli platter in my name!

06:00.400 --> 06:02.550
Please tell me
there's no raisins in the coleslaw.

06:02.600 --> 06:04.750
Dude, you are not invited!

06:05.440 --> 06:08.750
l can't believe l'm saying this,
but Jackson's right.

06:08.800 --> 06:11.950
He's worked so hard on this song,
and he's so proud of it.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.110
l've got to tell him l love it.

06:13.160 --> 06:14.960
You know what, Miley? lt'll be okay.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.750
So Hannah sings one clunker, big deal.

06:17.800 --> 06:19.550
Yeah, and the video will be cute.

06:19.600 --> 06:22.870
You surrounded by giant,
dancing bunnies, right?

06:22.920 --> 06:25.910
<i>l'm the bunny who stole your mone</i> y

06:27.160 --> 06:29.270
-l'm not helping, am l?
-No.

06:29.320 --> 06:34.680
Miles, if it makes you feel any better,
l know this is kind of hard on you,

06:34.720 --> 06:39.470
but, my life, it's so good right now!

06:40.080 --> 06:42.190
Boo-yah! Yeah!

06:43.520 --> 06:45.950
And you are still not invited!

06:54.760 --> 06:58.270
Got to tell Dad. Got to tell Dad.

07:00.760 --> 07:01.990
Dad?

07:04.200 --> 07:06.230
Got to tell Dad.

07:11.080 --> 07:14.790
lt's true! There's no place like home!

07:15.760 --> 07:18.110
There's no place like home!

07:19.280 --> 07:22.550
-Stop it, Jackson. Be a man.
-Dad?

07:24.560 --> 07:25.880
Dad?

07:25.920 --> 07:28.230
Look at that body slam!

07:29.560 --> 07:32.390
-Where's Dad?
-He's still on his date.

07:33.080 --> 07:35.670
Have to tell him the truth.

07:35.720 --> 07:39.510
-What?
-Have to tell him the truth.

07:39.560 --> 07:40.910
No.

07:41.920 --> 07:44.480
Wait, what are you...
Miles, what are you doing?

07:44.520 --> 07:48.590
Hate that song. Hate that song.

07:48.640 --> 07:51.600
Oh, man. Are you sleepwalking?

07:52.840 --> 07:55.070
l'll take that as a yes.

07:56.400 --> 07:57.630
Sorry.

07:59.160 --> 08:02.470
Come on, Miles. Miley, wake up.

08:02.520 --> 08:05.270
Come on, Miley, wakey, wakey!

08:05.320 --> 08:07.350
Oh, no, Dad.

08:07.400 --> 08:08.670
Dad?

08:09.680 --> 08:12.670
Hate that song. Got to tell Dad!

08:12.720 --> 08:14.390
No, no. Of course you do.

08:14.440 --> 08:17.510
l'll take you to him.
He's right under here!

08:19.600 --> 08:22.030
No way you're blowing my party!

08:23.560 --> 08:26.070
Jackson, what in the world?

08:27.440 --> 08:31.720
Miley sleeping, Jackson helping,
thigh cramping.

08:34.840 --> 08:38.350
And they wonder
why l never bring my dates home.

08:44.560 --> 08:46.390
Got to tell Dad.

08:49.720 --> 08:52.760
Got to tell Dad. Got to tell...

08:56.240 --> 08:58.590
Jackson, what are you doing?

08:58.640 --> 09:01.950
First of all,
do you want to tell Dad the truth?

09:02.000 --> 09:03.670
No! Of course not!

09:03.720 --> 09:05.670
Good. You're awake.

09:05.720 --> 09:07.520
And you're ugly.

09:07.560 --> 09:11.150
Now that we've covered the obvious,
what are you doing here?

09:11.200 --> 09:14.110
You were sleepwalking, and you almost
told Dad that you hate his song.

09:14.160 --> 09:15.230
Yeah, right.

09:15.280 --> 09:19.830
You think some guy named Jimmy
in your Biology class is ''yum-alicious.''

09:20.920 --> 09:24.120
-How do you know that?
-You told me that an hour ago!

09:24.160 --> 09:26.150
Look, this is just like
that time you were five,

09:26.200 --> 09:28.950
and you lied about breaking
Mom's favourite vase.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.350
Remember? You felt so guilty,

09:30.400 --> 09:34.110
you started sleepwalking and blabbing
the truth about everything. Remember?

09:34.160 --> 09:39.150
Oh, no. Uncle Earl never forgave me
for telling his poker buddies

09:39.200 --> 09:42.400
he hides aces in the folds of his belly.

09:42.440 --> 09:46.830
-You are not going to blow my party.
-Hey, l'm doing the best l can!

09:46.880 --> 09:49.840
Now you're going to do the best
that l can.

09:56.040 --> 09:58.430
Got to tell Dad.

10:00.720 --> 10:02.710
Got to tell Dad.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.310
One, two, cha, cha, cha.

10:20.400 --> 10:24.190
l pulled the mullet, Mother,
but it just wouldn't come off.

10:30.800 --> 10:34.070
Miley, you haven't slept in two days.
You can't keep doing this.

10:34.120 --> 10:35.440
You've got to get some rest.

10:35.480 --> 10:37.430
l know, but if l fall asleep at home,

10:37.480 --> 10:40.600
l'm not going to be able to stop myself
from telling Daddy the truth.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.750
And if l fall asleep anywhere else,

10:42.800 --> 10:45.550
who knows what's going
to spill out of my mouth!

10:46.640 --> 10:50.030
Speaking of something
spilling out of your mouth,

10:50.080 --> 10:52.190
somebody forgot to brush this morning.

10:52.240 --> 10:54.390
Hey, what do you want from me?

10:54.440 --> 10:57.430
l'm amazed
l could even get myself dressed.

11:01.160 --> 11:03.270
Love the new look, toots.

11:04.680 --> 11:06.430
Sweet niblets.

11:06.480 --> 11:08.630
Wow, she is tired.

11:08.680 --> 11:12.190
Yeah, l know. Hey, she can sleep over
at my house tonight.

11:12.240 --> 11:15.200
Hey, Miley, you can... Miley?

11:15.240 --> 11:17.590
-Good morning, class.
-Kunkle!

11:17.640 --> 11:19.230
Comma Miss.

11:19.960 --> 11:23.950
Oken comma Oliver.
Truscott comma Lilly.

11:25.320 --> 11:27.390
-Don't drag me into this.
-Okay.

11:27.440 --> 11:29.590
Oken, someday, years from now,

11:29.640 --> 11:32.950
you may feel the urge
to come back and visit me.

11:33.560 --> 11:35.230
Please don't.

11:39.080 --> 11:41.720
Miley. Miley, wake up. Wake up!

11:41.760 --> 11:43.350
Who's talking?

11:43.760 --> 11:45.640
You are, Skunkle.

11:47.520 --> 11:51.910
ln that awful prison-warden voice
of yours. lt is torture.

11:54.520 --> 11:55.840
Yikes.

12:00.320 --> 12:02.880
Excuse me. What did you say?

12:02.920 --> 12:06.750
She said your voice sounds
like a prison warden, and it's torture.

12:08.440 --> 12:10.910
-l heard her.
-Just trying to help.

12:10.960 --> 12:12.710
l don't need your help.

12:12.760 --> 12:16.750
What you need is to stop borrowing
your grandmother's clothes.

12:17.280 --> 12:18.710
Hey-o!

12:19.840 --> 12:22.430
Wait! No, no. She doesn't mean it.
She's sleepwalking.

12:22.480 --> 12:25.520
And when she sleepwalks,
she can only tell the truth.

12:25.560 --> 12:28.070
Truth! Got to tell Dad the truth!

12:31.040 --> 12:34.000
l mean, look at her. She'd never talk
to you like that if she was awake.

12:34.040 --> 12:36.510
She'd lie and say you look nice.

12:37.680 --> 12:39.910
Hey, great top.

12:39.960 --> 12:42.520
Last time she wore it, you said that
if you polished a table with it,

12:42.560 --> 12:45.390
the table would punch you in the face.

12:46.400 --> 12:49.630
l was kidding. Tables can't punch.

12:50.360 --> 12:51.680
Wake up!

12:53.200 --> 12:57.480
-Stewart, are you really asleep?
-Are you really wearing those shoes?

12:57.520 --> 12:59.030
Hey-o.

13:00.640 --> 13:03.230
They're comfortable,
and l walk to work!

13:03.280 --> 13:05.350
Why? Broom in the shop?

13:08.880 --> 13:11.710
l'm laughing, 'cause it's so ridiculous.

13:13.040 --> 13:14.270
You're a lovely woman,

13:14.320 --> 13:17.310
and l'm surprised
you haven't been married yet.

13:17.360 --> 13:19.390
Yesterday, you said it was
because of her man hands.

13:19.440 --> 13:24.470
Soft, supple man hands
is what l meant.

13:24.520 --> 13:26.950
Would you marry me, Karen?

13:27.000 --> 13:30.350
All right, knock it off.
You're not all asleep.

13:30.400 --> 13:33.070
That's 'cause
you haven't started teaching yet.

13:34.040 --> 13:35.870
Okay, that's enough.

13:36.520 --> 13:38.240
Miley, wake up.

13:40.240 --> 13:42.470
Sorry. Where were we?

13:42.520 --> 13:45.750
Well, we're in Science,
and you're in trouble.

13:45.800 --> 13:47.910
Principal's office. Now.

13:52.120 --> 13:53.840
How bad was it?

13:53.880 --> 13:55.790
Well, it started with ''Skunkle...''

13:55.840 --> 13:58.190
And made it all the way down
to ''man hands.''

13:58.240 --> 14:00.270
Thank you very much.

14:02.600 --> 14:05.590
l'm thinking it's time
to tell my daddy the truth.

14:05.640 --> 14:07.590
-You think?
-You think?

14:09.520 --> 14:12.320
Yo, Jackson. l'm bringing
a few extra people to your party.

14:12.360 --> 14:15.670
Sorry, dude, there's no... Wayne! Hey.

14:15.720 --> 14:18.280
Yeah, dude, of course.
Bring whoever you want.

14:18.320 --> 14:20.830
By the way, love the T-shirt.

14:20.880 --> 14:24.030
''lf you can read this,
you're about to be hit.''

14:24.960 --> 14:28.550
-You're a funny little dude.
-Thanks, man.

14:28.600 --> 14:32.230
But if your party stinks,
l'm gonna rearrange your face.

14:33.120 --> 14:34.950
As well you should.

14:35.840 --> 14:39.390
Don't read the shirt, don't read
the shirt, don't read the shirt.

14:39.440 --> 14:42.190
Dude, l cannot believe
the buzz on this party!

14:42.240 --> 14:45.150
Girls are saying hi to me
just because l know you!

14:45.200 --> 14:47.310
How did you get your dad
to say yes to this?

14:47.360 --> 14:50.630
Well, as you know, it's just a little
matter of psychology, timing and...

14:50.680 --> 14:52.790
And you haven't asked him yet,
have you?

14:52.840 --> 14:54.590
Okay, technically, no,

14:54.640 --> 14:56.200
but l'm on my way to ask him right now,

14:56.240 --> 14:57.990
and, trust me,
he's gonna be in a great mood.

14:58.040 --> 15:00.030
He better be. You cancel this party,

15:00.080 --> 15:01.310
you're going to spend
the rest of high school

15:01.360 --> 15:02.920
eating lunch with the chess club!

15:02.960 --> 15:06.310
You know how many hot girls
are in chess club? Zero.

15:06.360 --> 15:09.870
Well, l thought your girlfriend
was in the chess club.

15:11.400 --> 15:14.360
That's why l need this party! Hi, honey.

15:16.120 --> 15:18.030
Really, really badly.

15:21.600 --> 15:22.920
Dad?

15:24.120 --> 15:25.470
Dad?

15:25.520 --> 15:28.270
Just out of the shower! Down in a few!

15:28.320 --> 15:32.110
You take your time,
you brilliant songwriter!

15:32.160 --> 15:36.230
You hero and role model!

15:37.240 --> 15:41.120
Whatever you broke,
fix it or bury it in the yard.

15:42.720 --> 15:47.030
Yes! Yes! He's got Lucky Lulu back,
he's blow drying.

15:47.080 --> 15:50.590
lt's a perfect storm of Dad happiness!

15:50.640 --> 15:54.150
Dad. Dad, l got to talk to you.

15:54.200 --> 15:56.760
Oh, no, here we go again! Miley, stop!

15:56.800 --> 16:01.000
Jackson, l'm sorry about your party,
but l can't do this any more.

16:01.040 --> 16:02.230
l've got to tell Daddy the truth.

16:02.280 --> 16:06.270
No! No, no, no, you don't!
You're just sleepwalking!

16:06.320 --> 16:08.590
Come on, Miles, upsy-daisy!

16:08.640 --> 16:11.030
Stop that! Stop it. l'm awake!

16:11.080 --> 16:13.720
-Of course you are. Now come here.
-Jackson...

16:13.760 --> 16:16.400
Look, l know you're supposed
to wake a sleepwalker gently,

16:16.440 --> 16:17.790
but you leave me no choice.

16:17.840 --> 16:21.430
Desperate times call for loud cookware.

16:24.400 --> 16:28.230
l'm still awake, and you're still an idiot.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.910
What the Sam heck
is going on down there?

16:31.960 --> 16:33.470
-Daddy, l...
-Nothing! Nothing, nothing!

16:33.520 --> 16:35.240
We're just cooking you dinner,
handsome!

16:35.280 --> 16:38.190
Keep working on the 'do,
we'll see you in a few!

16:38.240 --> 16:40.830
Please, please, please, wake up!

16:42.720 --> 16:46.230
l'm still awake, you're still an idiot,

16:46.280 --> 16:48.840
and now my ear is full of spit.

16:50.320 --> 16:53.390
Sorry. Let me rinse it for you.

17:00.880 --> 17:03.110
Do you believe l'm awake now?

17:03.160 --> 17:04.560
Yes, l do.

17:05.920 --> 17:10.589
Listen, Jackson. Awake or asleep,
l'm still telling Dad the truth.

17:10.640 --> 17:13.680
No, you can't! Look, my reputation

17:13.720 --> 17:17.430
and the current arrangement
of my face depends on it.

17:17.480 --> 17:20.520
Maybe next time
your face shouldn't throw a party

17:20.560 --> 17:22.869
without getting permission first!

17:22.920 --> 17:24.750
Listen, Jackson, l'm sorry,

17:24.800 --> 17:27.680
but l respect Dad too much
to lie to him.

17:28.400 --> 17:30.120
-Miley...
-No!

17:30.560 --> 17:34.230
Jackson, this song is a joke.
lt's embarrassing,

17:35.080 --> 17:36.350
and no matter how much it hurts,

17:36.400 --> 17:40.070
l gotta tell him that l found it and
it's the worst song he's ever written.

17:40.120 --> 17:43.630
-Miley!
-lt may be the worst song ever written.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.990
l did say ''may be.''

17:50.040 --> 17:53.110
l heard it. l just can't believe it.

18:04.160 --> 18:07.360
Dad, do you hate me?

18:07.840 --> 18:10.720
No, of course l don't hate you.

18:10.760 --> 18:15.120
l hate it that you hate the song,
but l was just so sure you'd love it.

18:15.160 --> 18:19.600
You were? l mean, you were?

18:21.600 --> 18:25.510
l don't get it. You've never hated
one of my songs before.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.750
l suppose
l could take another look at it.

18:30.800 --> 18:36.870
What was it that bothered you?
The music? The lyrics? The message?

18:36.920 --> 18:38.240
What message?

18:38.280 --> 18:41.590
''Dang flabbit, where's my rabbit?
He took my money''

18:41.640 --> 18:45.110
What are you trying to say,
bunnies can't be trusted?

18:47.280 --> 18:50.990
Dad, this isn't funny. Come on,
kids don't want to hear that stuff.

18:51.040 --> 18:53.310
-They love bunnies!
-Yeah.

18:53.360 --> 18:56.950
And so did you
when you were five years old.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.510
That's when you wrote that song.

18:59.560 --> 19:01.360
Bunny man say what?

19:01.400 --> 19:05.840
Well, actually, you came up with
the words, but l wrote it down for you.

19:05.880 --> 19:09.550
But you signed it
with that little booger right there.

19:10.240 --> 19:12.350
What was it doing in your pocket?

19:12.400 --> 19:17.190
l keep it with me for when l get stuck.
Give me a little bit of inspiration

19:17.240 --> 19:19.430
and a giggle every now and then.

19:19.480 --> 19:22.230
Kind of reminds me
of the good old days.

19:22.280 --> 19:25.630
You would have known that
if you'd have just asked.

19:26.800 --> 19:28.200
Man.

19:30.640 --> 19:33.840
Wait a minute.
You mean there's a good song?

19:35.040 --> 19:38.550
There sure is. This is it.
You want to hear it?

19:38.600 --> 19:40.710
Do bunnies steal money?

19:40.760 --> 19:43.720
-l am loving it already!
-You ain't even heard it, Son.

19:43.760 --> 19:46.150
Sure, l have. ln here.

19:47.480 --> 19:50.830
Please be good, please be good,
please be good.

19:50.880 --> 19:54.270
-All right, here it goes.
-All right.

-That was great, dude.
-Well, thanks for coming!

21:42.360 --> 21:46.320
Glad you guys had a good time.
Especially you, Wayne!

21:46.360 --> 21:48.470
Watch out for that branch!

21:49.880 --> 21:52.630
Or just ignore it
and walk right through it.

21:52.680 --> 21:54.790
Who needs a helmet, huh?

21:59.640 --> 22:03.390
ln the light it looks a lot worse.

22:04.640 --> 22:08.630
Well, that's okay, Son.
l'll just call the maid service.

22:08.680 --> 22:09.830
Well, thanks, Dad!

22:09.880 --> 22:11.550
You know, that is one
of the many reasons

22:11.600 --> 22:15.990
why you're still my hero, my role model,
my... Just a second.

22:18.480 --> 22:20.360
-Hello?
-Clean it up.

22:21.440 --> 22:23.320
Who is this?

22:23.360 --> 22:25.270
l think you've got the wrong number.
Don't call here any more.
