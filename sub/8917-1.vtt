- Shh!
- Pip, sir! No, sir, please.

02:58.762 --> 03:01.106
Got wittles on you, boy?
You got wittles on you?

03:01.107 --> 03:02.099
No, sir!

Come here.

03:28.750 --> 03:29.842
You know what a file is?

03:30.127 --> 03:32.221
- You know what wittles is?
- Yes, sir, food, sir.

03:32.295 --> 03:35.890
I ain't alone, as you may think I am.

03:35.966 --> 03:40.267
There's a young man hid with me in
comparison with which I am an angel,

03:40.429 --> 03:42.557
and he has a secret way
of getting at a boy,

03:42.639 --> 03:46.485
and at his heart, and at his liver,
so that they may be roasted and ate.

03:46.643 --> 03:49.738
It is in vain for a boy to hide
from that young man.

03:50.230 --> 03:54.155
Now, you bring me tomorrow morning early,
in this graveyard,

03:54.156 --> 03:59.578
that file and them wittles,
never daring to say a word,

03:59.656 --> 04:03.832
and I will do what I can to keep
that young man out of your insides.

04:03.833 --> 04:05.249
Understand?

04:05.328 --> 04:06.830
- Speak it out!
- Yes, sir!

a dozen times looking for you.

04:42.324 --> 04:45.874
Now, listen, she's on the rampage
and she's got Tickler with her.

04:46.536 --> 04:50.336

get in there behind the door.

- The churchyard.
- The churchyard!

05:00.008 --> 05:03.228
If it weren't for me you would've been to
the churchyard years ago, and stayed there!

05:03.303 --> 05:05.554
- Who brought you up by hand?
- BOTH: You did!

05:05.555 --> 05:06.898
Why did I, I should like to know!

05:07.349 --> 05:08.646

- Fetch it!

05:12.062 --> 05:16.158
Bad enough having to be a blacksmith's
wife, without having to mother you, too.

05:16.775 --> 05:19.902
- You're driving me to the churchyard.
- You all right?

05:19.903 --> 05:21.504
You'd like that, both of you, I suppose.

05:22.030 --> 05:24.499

What might he have done, the convict?

05:38.133 --> 05:39.255
Murder most likely.

05:39.923 --> 05:42.642
That's why they put them in the Hulks,
because they murder.

05:42.926 --> 05:44.303
- Murder?
- Murder and robbing.

05:44.304 --> 05:46.100
That's too many questions!

Where's that bread gone?

05:51.601 --> 05:52.602

07:54.683 --> 07:55.730

- I wouldn't do that, sir.

- "Him"?

- Who's "him"?
- The young man you spoke of.

08:37.142 --> 08:40.270

- Down by the river.

- Yes, sir.

ain't grateful, he never will be.</i>

16:25.443 --> 16:26.786
I only hope he won't be pampered.

16:27.403 --> 16:29.246
She ain't in that line, Mum,
have no fear.

16:29.489 --> 16:31.650
- JOE: "She"?
- Well, Miss Havisham ain't a he, is she?

16:31.741 --> 16:33.163
Even you ain't as dull as that!

16:33.284 --> 16:35.036
Well put, ma'am. Good indeed.

16:35.244 --> 16:37.463
- Mr Pumblechook...
- Her tenant, don't you see?

16:37.538 --> 16:40.508
goes to pay his rent
and Miss Havisham says,

16:40.583 --> 16:43.678
does he know a boy who might go
and play there for her pleasure?

16:44.003 --> 16:48.133
And Mr Pumblechook always being
considerate and thoughtful of us...

16:48.216 --> 16:49.513
No more than you deserve, ma'am.

16:49.592 --> 16:51.594
mentions this boy prancing here.

16:52.136 --> 16:53.433
To go straightaway!

16:53.596 --> 16:56.770
For all we know our fortune might be made
and all he has to do is play!

16:56.849 --> 16:57.850
PIP: I don't want to.

16:58.267 --> 17:00.520
- You listen to me, ungrateful wretch.

17:00.603 --> 17:02.446

of quality and breeding

17:02.730 --> 17:05.950
or stay here and rot
with this great lumpen noodle?

17:08.444 --> 17:09.787
- Stay here.
- What?

17:11.489 --> 17:12.705
What? (GRUNTS)

17:14.825 --> 17:16.167

17:19.288 --> 17:20.585
Breathe in. Breathe.

17:26.420 --> 17:27.762
PUMBLECHOOK: Six sixes.

17:28.673 --> 17:30.465

17:30.466 --> 17:33.640
- Minus 35.
- One.

17:34.303 --> 17:35.600
Plus 119.

17:36.264 --> 17:37.436
119...

17:38.307 --> 17:39.650
Um, 120.

17:40.434 --> 17:41.936
Divided by 84.

17:43.813 --> 17:45.360
Your answer, please, boy. Your answer.

17:46.482 --> 17:48.029
So start again.

17:48.943 --> 17:51.492
12 times 39.

18:03.291 --> 18:04.338
Four times 17.

18:05.167 --> 18:06.669
Too slow. 68.

18:06.919 --> 18:07.966
Nine times 13.

18:09.463 --> 18:11.090

18:18.848 --> 18:21.692
Now, boy, remember your station

18:21.892 --> 18:25.192
and let your conduct be a credit as to
those which brought you up by hand.

Ow! (GRUNTS)

PUMBLECHOOK: Never mind the clock...

18:53.007 --> 18:55.216
- What name?
- Pumblechook.

18:55.217 --> 18:56.264
Quite right.

18:56.886 --> 18:58.388
Do you wish to see Miss Havisham?

18:59.430 --> 19:02.024
- Well, if Miss Havisham wishes to see me!
- She don't.

19:02.767 --> 19:04.394
Come along, boy.

19:04.560 --> 19:05.607
Boy.

19:23.496 --> 19:25.248
Are you frightened?

19:26.290 --> 19:27.792
(STAMMERS) I don't know.

19:32.838 --> 19:34.260
Go in, then.

19:35.257 --> 19:36.804
(NERVOUSLY) After you, miss.

20:12.586 --> 20:13.929
Who is it?

20:15.464 --> 20:16.556
Pip, ma'am.

20:18.467 --> 20:19.514
Pip?

20:19.635 --> 20:23.606
Pumblechook's boy,
come to, uh, play.

20:24.473 --> 20:25.520
Oh.

20:27.351 --> 20:29.024
Ah, yes.
Um...

20:30.229 --> 20:31.481
Come nearer.

20:31.605 --> 20:33.152
Let me look at you.

20:39.655 --> 20:40.656
Look at me!

20:43.117 --> 20:46.037
You're not afraid of a woman who's
never seen the sun since you were born?

20:47.747 --> 20:48.839
(NERVOUSLY) No, ma'am.

20:49.540 --> 20:51.167
Then come closer.

20:54.754 --> 20:55.755
Hmm.

21:06.307 --> 21:10.028
Now, I sometimes have sick fancies.

21:10.352 --> 21:14.858
And, um, I have a sick fancy
that I want to see some play.

21:15.316 --> 21:17.410
Um, so... play.

21:17.485 --> 21:18.782
Go on, play.

21:18.861 --> 21:19.953
Play.

21:23.115 --> 21:25.209
- Are you sullen and obstinate?
- No, ma'am!

21:25.409 --> 21:28.581
I am very sorry for you
and sorry that I can't play.

21:28.582 --> 21:33.050
But if you complain of me
I will get into trouble with my sister,

21:33.125 --> 21:36.720
so I would play if I could,
but it's just so new here.

21:37.087 --> 21:39.055
Call Estella! Estella!

21:39.757 --> 21:41.009
Estella!

21:46.972 --> 21:47.973
Mmm.

21:51.894 --> 21:53.269
(CHUCKLES)

21:53.270 --> 21:58.151
(WHISPERS) Your own one day, my dear,
and you will use it well.

22:01.153 --> 22:03.906
Now. Let me see you play cards with him.

22:04.865 --> 22:07.084
(WHISPERS)
But he's a common labouring boy.

22:07.743 --> 22:09.245
(WHISPERS)
You can break his heart.

22:11.080 --> 22:12.377
What do you play, boy?

22:13.082 --> 22:15.631
(NERVOUSLY) Nothing but
Beggar My Neighbour, miss.

22:15.632 --> 22:17.094
So...

22:17.628 --> 22:18.675
Beggar him.

22:18.754 --> 22:20.427
(CACKLES)

22:36.438 --> 22:38.532
PIP: The jack of diamonds.
ESTELLA: "Jack"!

22:38.899 --> 22:40.742
He calls the knaves "jack", this boy.

22:42.444 --> 22:43.946
And what coarse hands he has,

22:45.739 --> 22:46.786
and what thick boots.

22:48.117 --> 22:51.462
He's nothing but a stupid,
clumsy labouring boy.

22:55.124 --> 22:56.125
What do you think of her?

22:57.042 --> 22:58.965
You say nothing of her.

23:00.129 --> 23:01.881
(NERVOUSLY) I don't like to say.

23:02.840 --> 23:04.513
Whisper in my ear.

23:08.637 --> 23:09.638
Hm.

23:10.139 --> 23:11.812
What do you think?

23:12.224 --> 23:14.568
I think she is very proud.

23:15.519 --> 23:16.736
HAVISHAM: Anything else?

23:16.812 --> 23:17.813
PIP: I think...

23:19.648 --> 23:20.991
I think she is very pretty.

23:21.984 --> 23:23.486
HAVISHAM: Anything else?

23:23.487 --> 23:26.705
PIP: I think she is very insulting.

23:28.449 --> 23:30.326
I think I should like to go home.

23:31.577 --> 23:32.669
What?

23:33.078 --> 23:34.546
And never see her again?

23:35.164 --> 23:36.725
PIP: I think I'd like to see her again.

23:37.416 --> 23:38.963
HAVISHAM: Then you shall.

23:41.170 --> 23:42.672
Then you shall.

23:44.340 --> 23:46.684
But when, when shall I
have you here again?

23:47.343 --> 23:48.344
Today is Wednesday.

23:48.427 --> 23:49.849
No Wednesdays, Thursdays,
Fridays here,

23:49.929 --> 23:51.569
no days of the week,
no weeks of the year.

23:53.849 --> 23:57.399
No... Come again after six nights.

23:58.187 --> 23:59.689
Estella, take him down.

24:00.439 --> 24:01.440
Feed him.

Enough! Enough, I say!

24:38.852 --> 24:40.729
Back to your form, Pip.

24:41.355 --> 24:42.572
(SNORING)

24:45.484 --> 24:47.907

25:04.128 --> 25:06.256
I wonder if you might teach me.

25:06.380 --> 25:08.007
Teach you what, Pip?

25:08.090 --> 25:09.307
Everything.

25:09.383 --> 25:11.602
I want to know everything.

25:12.052 --> 25:13.429
(LAUGHING) Everything?

25:14.221 --> 25:19.102
Goodness, well,
that might take a little time.

25:19.935 --> 25:21.278
Pip, whatever for?

25:22.479 --> 25:24.982
Do you know the name of the house, boy?

25:25.190 --> 25:26.863
It is Satis House.

25:27.568 --> 25:30.447
Is that Greek or Latin?

25:30.529 --> 25:35.626
Greek or Latin or Hebrew or all three,
for "enough".

25:35.784 --> 25:38.453
Enough House. That's a curious name.

25:38.454 --> 25:39.996
Don't loiter!

25:39.997 --> 25:43.501
It meant, when it was given,
that whoever had this house

25:43.584 --> 25:45.302
would want for nothing else.

25:46.295 --> 25:48.923
They must have been easily satisfied.

25:51.383 --> 25:53.349

25:53.350 --> 25:55.562
- None of your business.

We have been waiting!

- The little bitch.
- ESTELLA: Ignore them.

26:12.154 --> 26:14.514
PIP: So are they your relations too?
ESTELLA: Certainly not.

26:14.990 --> 26:16.788
I have no relations.

26:43.310 --> 26:46.359
Ah. So you're the boy, are you?

26:46.855 --> 26:52.077
Well, I have a pretty large experience of
boys, and you're a bad set of fellows.

26:52.152 --> 26:53.745
Behave yourself.

26:55.531 --> 26:58.034
You're to wait here in the ballroom.

No. On this day of the year,
long before you were born,

27:34.486 --> 27:36.329
this heap of decay was brought here...

27:37.197 --> 27:39.199
We've worn away together.

27:39.533 --> 27:41.284
Mice have gnawed at it.

27:41.285 --> 27:43.413
And sharper teeth than mice
have gnawed at me.

27:46.081 --> 27:48.129
When the ruin is complete,

27:48.417 --> 27:52.138
when they lay me dead in my bride's dress,

27:52.588 --> 27:54.386
on the bride's table,

27:54.506 --> 27:56.258
the curse will be finished on him.

32:05.632 --> 32:08.226
One, two, three, four.

32:08.510 --> 32:11.013
One, two, three, four.

32:18.478 --> 32:21.197

32:21.314 --> 32:23.988

32:32.742 --> 32:34.790
One, two, three...

32:35.036 --> 32:36.253
HAVISHAM: Estella.

32:37.414 --> 32:39.166
What are you doing?

32:39.666 --> 32:41.885
Teaching Pip to dance.

32:41.960 --> 32:43.587
Like a gentleman.

32:48.049 --> 32:49.689
HAVISHAM: Bring the blacksmith to see me.

33:01.730 --> 33:02.822
PIP: Joe.

33:18.455 --> 33:19.502
Oh.

33:20.040 --> 33:23.044
So you are the husband
of the sister of the boy?

33:26.338 --> 33:28.134
Being that I have been married
to your sister...

33:28.135 --> 33:29.178
Just say yes, Joe.

33:29.257 --> 33:31.430
- JOE: By which I mean to say...
- Joe.

33:31.510 --> 33:33.262
Yes, Miss Havisham.

33:33.678 --> 33:38.104
And you have reared the boy with the
intention of making him your apprentice?

33:40.101 --> 33:42.604
You know, Pip, as you and I
ever were the best of friends,

33:43.104 --> 33:47.701
and it were look for'ard to betwixt us
as being calculated to lead to larks.

33:54.533 --> 33:57.457
The boy has made no objection
to the trade?

33:58.036 --> 33:59.502
Larks being the great wish of his heart.

33:59.503 --> 34:00.622
Oh, enough! Estella.

34:00.956 --> 34:02.708
Um, bring me that purse.

34:05.669 --> 34:06.795
Yes, um...

34:07.546 --> 34:09.889
Pip has earnt a premium here.

34:10.757 --> 34:12.475
Here are five and 20 guineas.

34:13.552 --> 34:14.831
Give it to your new master, Pip.

34:23.311 --> 34:24.527
Now...

34:24.728 --> 34:27.197
You are now a blacksmith.

34:27.274 --> 34:28.571
Goodbye.

34:34.489 --> 34:36.491
You are not ashamed
of being a blacksmith, are you?

34:36.992 --> 34:37.993
No.

34:38.534 --> 34:40.286
Then you are a blacksmith.

34:40.495 --> 34:41.496
Goodbye.

34:42.831 --> 34:44.206
But...

34:44.206 --> 34:45.675
Am I to come again?

34:47.293 --> 34:49.922
No.
Goodbye, Pip.

34:50.005 --> 34:51.427
You have been a good boy.

34:52.047 --> 34:54.346
Goodbye. Goodbye.

35:00.015 --> 35:01.858
Come on. Let's go.

35:16.489 --> 35:20.539
Perhaps we shall meet again.
One day.

35:24.247 --> 35:25.920
It seems unlikely.

35:33.256 --> 35:35.224
JOE: Pip. Pip.

35:36.718 --> 35:38.186
Come on, boy.

36:25.100 --> 36:26.147
Pip.

36:26.559 --> 36:27.685
Joe, may I?

36:32.524 --> 36:34.993
(LAUGHING)

37:30.165 --> 37:31.838
Biddy, I wish...

37:33.376 --> 37:34.548
Go on.

37:35.044 --> 37:36.136
Pip?

37:41.259 --> 37:43.057
Biddy, I wish I could
fall in love with you.

37:44.012 --> 37:45.512
Oh.

37:45.513 --> 37:49.313
- Can I say this to you?
- Don't mind me.

37:51.519 --> 37:53.360
I wish I could love you and my work

37:53.361 --> 37:56.026
and that I could settle down with Joe
at the forge,

37:56.027 --> 37:57.867
and that we could be
sitting here together,

37:57.868 --> 38:00.203
two completely different people.

38:00.779 --> 38:03.828
I do wish I could be content, but...

38:05.700 --> 38:07.077
You cannot.

38:14.042 --> 38:16.215
Might you be content with me?

38:17.378 --> 38:18.630
I might.

38:19.923 --> 38:22.051
But then I'm easily pleased.

38:27.388 --> 38:29.732
Do you think of her very often?

38:41.569 --> 38:43.446
(CLANGING)

38:44.906 --> 38:46.283
JOE: Pip. Pip!

38:47.242 --> 38:49.040
Gentleman to see you.

38:51.204 --> 38:52.251
You are Philip Pirrip,

38:53.456 --> 38:56.175
more commonly known as Pip, am I right?

38:56.835 --> 38:59.463
- Yes, sir.
- And this is your brother-in-law...

39:00.046 --> 39:02.595
- Joseph, or "Joe" Gargery?
- I am that man.

39:02.715 --> 39:04.763
- And your wife, Mr Gargery?
- JOE: Dead, sir.

39:04.843 --> 39:06.140
Bad heart.

39:06.219 --> 39:10.019
Passed away five years since,
while on the rampage. I miss her.

39:10.765 --> 39:12.142
- I miss her.
- Condolences, yes.

39:12.934 --> 39:15.278
My name is Jaggers.
I'm a lawyer in London.

39:15.353 --> 39:16.775
I'm pretty well known.

39:17.188 --> 39:20.317
And I have some unusual business
to transact with you.

39:24.237 --> 39:26.615
Joseph Gargery,
I am the bearer of an offer...

39:26.823 --> 39:29.372
To relieve you of this young fellow,
your apprentice.

39:30.243 --> 39:34.419
I am here to inform you
that he has great expectations.

39:36.624 --> 39:39.093
He has come into a handsome fortune,

39:39.794 --> 39:43.549
and it is the desire of the present
possessor of the fortune

39:43.756 --> 39:47.010
that he be removed
from his present circumstances

39:47.093 --> 39:49.812
and brought up as a gentleman in London.

39:53.641 --> 39:55.234
Do you have any objections?

39:56.644 --> 39:59.818
- I don't think so.
- (CHUCKLES) There are conditions, of course.

39:59.898 --> 40:02.492
The first being that you always
retain the name Pip.

40:02.567 --> 40:04.194
You've no objections to that,
I dare say.

40:04.277 --> 40:06.075
I have no objection.

40:06.529 --> 40:08.372
And the second stipulation,

40:08.448 --> 40:13.170
is that the name of the liberal benefactor
remain a profound secret.

40:13.995 --> 40:15.997
You are positively prohibited

40:16.748 --> 40:19.308
from making any enquiries into this question.
Do you understand'?

40:20.084 --> 40:21.427
I understand.

40:21.836 --> 40:23.509
- Mr Gargery?
- Hm?

40:24.339 --> 40:26.467
Mr Gargery, this is for you.

40:27.050 --> 40:28.051
20 guineas.

40:28.968 --> 40:31.096
As compensation
for the loss of his services.

40:36.184 --> 40:38.152
Very generous, I think you'd agree.

40:38.436 --> 40:41.030
If you think money can make compensation

40:41.105 --> 40:43.528
for the loss of the little orphan
what come to the forge and was...

40:43.691 --> 40:46.091
- it's time for us, Joe.
- Yes, yes, yes, very noble sentiment.

40:46.152 --> 40:47.902
Very touching, I'm sure.
Do you want the money or no?

40:47.903 --> 40:49.423
- If you're a man, come on!
- PIP: Joe.

in my own home.

40:52.075 --> 40:53.541

- Joe! Enough! Enough!

you leave here, the better.

41:10.102 --> 41:11.970
Shall we say one week?

41:14.222 --> 41:15.382
And what will I do in London?

41:15.556 --> 41:16.557
Do?

41:16.808 --> 41:18.731
What will be my trade?

41:19.519 --> 41:20.896
My profession?

41:21.312 --> 41:23.110
A gentleman.
You will be a gentleman.

41:24.065 --> 41:25.866
You will please consider me
your guardian now.

41:29.362 --> 41:30.830

you need your inexpressibles

41:38.289 --> 41:40.255
in something fine, clingy!

41:41.124 --> 41:43.172
- A nice lute string, ladies.
- (LADIES CHUCKLING)

41:43.251 --> 41:46.425

being in nankeen, now, is there?

41:46.796 --> 41:48.048
No point at all.

41:48.214 --> 41:50.308
Nothing clings. Nothing is expressed.

41:50.508 --> 41:52.727
- (LAUGHTER CONTINUES)
- Mr Pumblechook.

for light summer wear.

- PIP: You may.

42:17.702 --> 42:19.875

D'you feel that'?

42:20.121 --> 42:21.293
(WHISTLES) Yah.

42:21.706 --> 42:23.174

42:23.624 --> 42:27.800
Extra super fine and quite in vogue
amongst the London gentry. Number five...

42:29.756 --> 42:31.008
This is you as well.

42:31.507 --> 42:32.975
This is very you.

42:33.468 --> 42:35.596
That will be evening
and that will be daytime.

42:36.387 --> 42:37.855
So, best to get them both.

42:38.431 --> 42:40.104
What about some gentleman's boots?

42:40.683 --> 42:41.809
We don't do boots.

- I hope so.
- Mm.

01:16:00.854 --> 01:16:02.850
Perhaps. If I cared.

01:16:03.642 --> 01:16:05.315
But you must care!

01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:08.818
To encourage a man as despised,

01:16:08.898 --> 01:16:11.902
as unworthy and boorish
as Bentley Drummle.

01:16:12.151 --> 01:16:14.904
And this is a man who has nothing
to recommend him except money...

01:16:14.987 --> 01:16:17.331
Pip, don't let it affect you so.

01:16:18.115 --> 01:16:19.708
I can't help it!

01:16:19.825 --> 01:16:21.998
To give that man the looks and smiles
you never give to me...

01:16:22.078 --> 01:16:24.001
Do you want me to deceive you?

01:16:25.664 --> 01:16:27.587
- Do you deceive him?
- Yes!

01:16:27.666 --> 01:16:30.502
Yes, him and many, many other men.

01:16:30.503 --> 01:16:31.755
All men.

01:16:33.339 --> 01:16:34.966
All men but you.

01:16:35.758 --> 01:16:37.806
And why am I to be spared?

01:16:41.097 --> 01:16:42.724
Why do you think?

01:17:18.217 --> 01:17:20.219
JAGGERS: Lovely evening, isn't it?

01:17:22.221 --> 01:17:24.315
A storm later, so they say.

01:17:25.599 --> 01:17:28.523
Estella, Mr Drummle
requires your presence.

01:17:32.565 --> 01:17:33.862
Urgently.

01:17:44.076 --> 01:17:45.328
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

01:18:09.143 --> 01:18:10.770
(FIRE CRACKLING)

01:18:11.937 --> 01:18:13.439
(CLOCK CHIMES)

01:18:15.274 --> 01:18:16.446
PIP: Hello?

01:18:17.776 --> 01:18:19.778
- (DISTANT BANG)
- Herbert?

01:18:21.530 --> 01:18:23.203
You're back early!

01:18:23.699 --> 01:18:25.201
Who's there?

01:18:45.930 --> 01:18:47.147
(GASPS) Who are you?

01:18:47.264 --> 01:18:50.268
Wait, wait, wait. Shh. Wait.

01:18:50.476 --> 01:18:51.648
How'd you get in here?

01:19:00.236 --> 01:19:01.488
Good God.

01:19:10.496 --> 01:19:12.123
What are you...

01:19:16.669 --> 01:19:19.548
You acted noble, my boy.

01:19:20.839 --> 01:19:23.683
Noble, and I have never forgot it.

01:19:23.884 --> 01:19:27.514
Look, if you're grateful to me
for what I did as a boy,

01:19:28.681 --> 01:19:30.479
it's not necessary.

01:19:30.975 --> 01:19:34.445
- Really. You must understand.
- What must I understand?

01:19:35.521 --> 01:19:38.195
That I cannot renew our acquaintance.

01:19:38.857 --> 01:19:40.097
My life has changed since then.

01:19:40.859 --> 01:19:42.861
Now, I'm glad that you're well
and you've repented.

01:19:42.862 --> 01:19:44.863
But really, you must go.

01:19:45.656 --> 01:19:46.873
Please.

01:19:47.408 --> 01:19:49.376
How about a drink first?

01:19:49.868 --> 01:19:51.245
Before I go.

01:19:55.833 --> 01:19:56.959
How have you been living?

01:19:58.377 --> 01:20:00.050
A sheep farmer,

01:20:01.714 --> 01:20:04.183
stock breeder, in the New World.

01:20:05.509 --> 01:20:07.511
Many a thousand mile off.

01:20:10.055 --> 01:20:12.683
- You've done well?
- I've done wonderful well.

01:20:13.392 --> 01:20:15.770
Seems, you've done well, too.

01:20:17.438 --> 01:20:18.530
Yes.

01:20:18.897 --> 01:20:21.025
Yes. No, I have. Thank you.

01:20:21.233 --> 01:20:23.156
I would like, if I may,

01:20:23.986 --> 01:20:24.987
to give you this gift.

01:20:26.780 --> 01:20:29.124
A token. For old times.

01:20:34.538 --> 01:20:36.040
Before you go.

01:20:50.596 --> 01:20:52.269
(WHISPERS) There's your gift.

01:20:53.807 --> 01:20:58.483
Might a varmint make so bold
as to ask you, how you've done well...

01:20:59.271 --> 01:21:01.114
Since we were on them marshes?

01:21:02.775 --> 01:21:03.822
Mmm?

01:21:04.568 --> 01:21:05.728
I've come into some property.

01:21:05.778 --> 01:21:09.157
And might he ask whose property?

01:21:09.281 --> 01:21:10.783
No, I cannot say her name.
There are conditions.

01:21:10.866 --> 01:21:11.913
CONVICT: Conditions?

01:21:12.076 --> 01:21:14.670
Could I make a guess as to your income?

01:21:16.413 --> 01:21:18.381
Might the first figure be a...

01:21:19.124 --> 01:21:20.125
A five?

01:21:20.209 --> 01:21:22.462
- How could you...
- And you would have had a guardian?

01:21:22.753 --> 01:21:26.132
A lawyer, maybe,
with a name beginning with a...

01:21:26.215 --> 01:21:27.307
A J?

01:21:27.716 --> 01:21:32.222
A J, perhaps, who might have sent me
your address when I landed in Portsmouth?

01:21:33.555 --> 01:21:35.523
Mr Jaggers, perhaps?

01:21:37.684 --> 01:21:39.436
Yes, dear boy. Yes.

01:21:39.812 --> 01:21:42.235
I've made a gentleman of you.

01:21:47.277 --> 01:21:49.154
I swore that time

01:21:49.238 --> 01:21:51.240
as sure as I ever earned a guinea,

01:21:51.698 --> 01:21:53.075
that guinea should go to you.

01:21:53.158 --> 01:21:54.200
No...

01:21:54.201 --> 01:21:57.330
I lived rough that you should live smooth.

01:21:57.871 --> 01:22:02.502
I worked hard that you
should be above work.

01:22:04.294 --> 01:22:05.671
I made you!

01:22:07.047 --> 01:22:08.549
I'm your, your father, Pip.

01:22:08.632 --> 01:22:10.680
No. No, no, no. You are not my father!

01:22:10.759 --> 01:22:12.181
No, no.

01:22:13.011 --> 01:22:14.558
Your second father, then.

01:22:15.305 --> 01:22:17.524
You're my son. No...

01:22:17.766 --> 01:22:20.736
No, you're more to me than any son.

01:22:22.104 --> 01:22:24.482
Look at you, dear boy!
(CRYING)

01:22:25.190 --> 01:22:28.114
Look at these lodgings.
They're fit for a lord.

01:22:28.193 --> 01:22:31.948
And yeah, this watch and this ring

01:22:32.030 --> 01:22:34.533
and your linen and your clothes.

01:22:35.659 --> 01:22:38.412
And your, your books, too.

01:22:39.037 --> 01:22:40.209
Oh!

01:22:40.664 --> 01:22:42.758
You read them all, have you?

01:22:43.750 --> 01:22:45.252
You shall read them to me...

01:22:46.211 --> 01:22:48.634
And I shall be so proud, to think that

01:22:49.590 --> 01:22:52.594
I'm the maker of such a man.

01:22:56.096 --> 01:22:59.270
I must sleep, long and sound.

01:22:59.892 --> 01:23:02.190
It's a long time since I slept.

01:23:03.312 --> 01:23:05.485
You'll keep watch, dear boy?

01:23:05.647 --> 01:23:07.866
Cos, look here. Here.

01:23:09.860 --> 01:23:11.737
Caution is necessary.

01:23:12.404 --> 01:23:14.202
I was sent for life.

01:23:14.656 --> 01:23:18.331
It's death to come back.
I should be hanged if took.

01:23:18.744 --> 01:23:20.542
You risked your life to come to me?

01:23:20.704 --> 01:23:22.581
That's right, dear boy.

01:23:23.248 --> 01:23:26.593
(STAMMERS) I...
I don't even know your name.

01:23:27.419 --> 01:23:28.671
Magwitch.

01:23:28.754 --> 01:23:31.223
Abel Magwitch.

01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:53.829
<i>PIP: Well, is it true?
JAGGERS: Do not commit yourself.</i>

01:23:53.987 --> 01:23:55.612
<i>Do not tell me anything, I do not want...</i>

01:23:55.613 --> 01:23:59.790
- ls what I've been told true?
- "Told" implies verbal communication.

01:24:00.744 --> 01:24:04.669
You cannot have verbal communication
with a man in New South Wales.

01:24:04.748 --> 01:24:07.046
- I was always led to believe...
- Nothing.

01:24:07.709 --> 01:24:08.801
Nothing.

01:24:08.877 --> 01:24:11.972
You believed what you chose to believe.
Mmm-hmm?

01:24:13.549 --> 01:24:15.643
It's not my responsibility.

01:24:16.093 --> 01:24:19.142
Now, I understand you have
an uncle staying with you.

01:24:20.514 --> 01:24:21.811
Yes? Yes?

01:24:23.642 --> 01:24:24.985
- Yes.
- Right.

01:24:25.811 --> 01:24:28.189
May I, suggest you buy him
some new clothes,

01:24:28.897 --> 01:24:31.821
advise him to spend most of his time
in your rooms

01:24:32.192 --> 01:24:34.320
and perhaps have a haircut.

01:24:34.611 --> 01:24:35.783
Yes?

01:24:35.988 --> 01:24:40.619
Meanwhile, if you are writing to
your friend in New South Wales,

01:24:41.118 --> 01:24:43.462
you may choose to send him that.

01:24:43.579 --> 01:24:45.047
The balance of our accounts.

01:24:45.539 --> 01:24:46.961
Mmm-hmm?

01:24:47.499 --> 01:24:50.469
My services are ended.

01:24:52.337 --> 01:24:54.010
Good day, Mr Pip.

01:24:58.760 --> 01:25:01.309
All that time, in Satis
House, I was just a...

01:25:02.389 --> 01:25:04.687
A mechanical heart to practise on.

01:25:06.184 --> 01:25:08.403
Estella was never meant for me at all.

01:25:09.187 --> 01:25:12.407
And you, my "guardian",
have known this all along.

01:25:12.858 --> 01:25:14.030
(WEMMICK CLEARS HIS THROAT)

01:25:15.986 --> 01:25:17.363
JAGGERS: Well...

01:25:18.614 --> 01:25:21.993
You may as well hear this from me
as anyone else.

01:25:22.242 --> 01:25:24.040
Um...

01:25:24.119 --> 01:25:26.372
The Spider has played his hand.

01:25:41.219 --> 01:25:43.062
DRUMMLE: Can I help you?

01:25:44.014 --> 01:25:47.393
- Open this gate, Drummle, or I swear...
- Why, it's the smithy's boy!

01:25:48.810 --> 01:25:50.733
Don't lose your temper, smithy's boy.

01:25:51.563 --> 01:25:54.157
Seems to me
you've lost quite enough already.

01:26:06.870 --> 01:26:08.338
Pip?

01:26:08.914 --> 01:26:11.292
- Pip.
- Oh, enough!

01:26:12.876 --> 01:26:15.425
What I have to say to Estella
I will say before you.

01:26:16.421 --> 01:26:18.515
But, Miss Havisham...

01:26:20.258 --> 01:26:22.429
When you first took me from my home,

01:26:22.430 --> 01:26:26.898
I came as a kind of servant,
to gratify a whim and be paid for it.

01:26:27.099 --> 01:26:28.146
Yes.

01:26:28.225 --> 01:26:31.445
And when I fell into my mistake of
imagining that you were my benefactor...

01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:33.943
Yes, I... Let you go on.

01:26:36.608 --> 01:26:37.951
Was that kind?

01:26:39.236 --> 01:26:41.955
Kind? Who am I to be kind?

01:26:44.908 --> 01:26:47.411
No, it amused me...

01:26:48.620 --> 01:26:50.497
To punish my relations.

01:26:51.957 --> 01:26:54.836
You were adequately paid, I believe.
What else do you want'?

01:26:59.381 --> 01:27:00.428
Estella.

01:27:07.514 --> 01:27:09.312
You know I love you.

01:27:09.850 --> 01:27:12.649
I have loved you since
I first saw you in this house.

01:27:13.854 --> 01:27:18.200
Foolishly, I had hoped that Miss Havisham
had meant us for each other.

01:27:19.276 --> 01:27:21.404
Clearly the idea was absurd,

01:27:21.987 --> 01:27:24.329
and I hope Miss Havisham will take
what pleasure she can

01:27:24.330 --> 01:27:27.667
in knowing that I am as unhappy
as she ever meant me to be.

01:27:29.077 --> 01:27:31.000
ESTELLA: These are sentiments,

01:27:31.663 --> 01:27:34.382
emotions that I am unable to comprehend.

01:27:34.791 --> 01:27:37.001
When you say you love me,

01:27:37.002 --> 01:27:41.098
I understand it as a form of words
but it touches nothing here.

01:27:41.214 --> 01:27:43.637
- I don't believe you.
- Did I not warn you?

01:27:43.925 --> 01:27:45.518
- Yes.
- Did you not think I meant it?

01:27:45.677 --> 01:27:48.396
- No. It's not natural!
- It is natural in me!

01:27:48.472 --> 01:27:50.474
And yet still I love you.

01:27:53.101 --> 01:27:55.729
I know that I'll never
call you mine, Estella,

01:27:56.354 --> 01:27:58.231
yet still I love you.

01:27:58.857 --> 01:28:02.407
I love you and I beg you
do not marry Bentley Drummle.

01:28:03.361 --> 01:28:06.365
Someone else, anyone, but not that brute.

01:28:06.490 --> 01:28:09.039
ESTELLA: Too late. It's too late.

01:28:10.702 --> 01:28:12.745
I am going to marry him.

01:28:12.746 --> 01:28:15.420
The preparations are already under way.

01:28:17.125 --> 01:28:19.628
- You can't let Miss Havisham...
- It is my own act.

01:28:20.045 --> 01:28:23.345
Miss Havisham has urged me to wait,
to reconsider.

01:28:25.383 --> 01:28:27.431
But I am tired of my life.

01:28:29.846 --> 01:28:31.723
We will do well enough.

01:28:36.728 --> 01:28:38.446
Give me your hand.

01:28:43.151 --> 01:28:44.949
Be happy, Pip-

01:28:45.821 --> 01:28:47.744
This will pass in time.

01:28:47.823 --> 01:28:49.871
I'll be out of your thoughts in a week.

01:28:51.910 --> 01:28:53.662
Out of my thoughts?

01:28:54.079 --> 01:28:55.877
You're in every thought.

01:28:56.957 --> 01:28:58.959
You're part of my existence.

01:28:59.835 --> 01:29:01.303
Part of me.

01:29:01.753 --> 01:29:03.755
You're in every thought,

01:29:03.922 --> 01:29:06.766
in every line I have ever read since
I first came here.

01:29:07.926 --> 01:29:09.760
You're in the river,

01:29:09.761 --> 01:29:11.604
the sails of ships,

01:29:12.055 --> 01:29:13.807
the sea, the clouds,

01:29:14.516 --> 01:29:15.984
the stones of London.

01:29:17.853 --> 01:29:21.278
Until the last hours of my life,
you will remain in me...

01:29:21.898 --> 01:29:24.742
Part of the little good, part of the evil.

01:29:26.486 --> 01:29:29.035
And I will always think of the good.

01:29:38.039 --> 01:29:39.712
Goodbye. God bless you.

01:29:40.750 --> 01:29:43.845
HAVISHAM: So proud, so hard.

01:29:45.881 --> 01:29:47.975
I am what you have made me!

01:29:49.467 --> 01:29:51.140
You are my mother,

01:29:51.344 --> 01:29:53.642
and yet I have never
seen your face by daylight.

01:29:54.681 --> 01:29:58.481
Since I was a baby, you taught me
that there was no such thing as daylight,

01:29:58.560 --> 01:30:00.654
that it had blighted you...

01:30:01.855 --> 01:30:03.903
And it would blight me, too, if I let it.

01:30:06.943 --> 01:30:08.160
Well...

01:30:09.529 --> 01:30:11.497
I am what you made me.

01:30:15.410 --> 01:30:17.629
This is what you made me.

01:30:20.749 --> 01:30:22.376
Come with me now.

01:31:07.545 --> 01:31:09.386
I'd like to help Mr Pocket.

01:31:09.387 --> 01:31:10.598
He has been a loyal and decent friend

01:31:10.674 --> 01:31:13.268
and I'd like to use the money
that remains to do one good thing.

01:31:13.468 --> 01:31:16.722
I'd like to purchase him a position.
Without his knowledge.

01:31:16.888 --> 01:31:21.234
Allowing for debts, which are substantial,
I might add, that's £500, sir.

01:31:21.851 --> 01:31:24.479
- All invested in a friend'?
- Yes, yes. Every last penny.

01:31:24.562 --> 01:31:25.779
What's your advice?

01:31:26.606 --> 01:31:27.949
(SCOFFS)

01:31:28.274 --> 01:31:31.494
Well, sir, if I was in the office, I would
suggest that you take that £500,

01:31:31.569 --> 01:31:33.116
and choose your bridge.

01:31:33.196 --> 01:31:35.447
There are six to choose from up
as high as Chelsea Reach

01:31:35.448 --> 01:31:37.246
and throw the money off it.

01:31:37.575 --> 01:31:41.205
You'll lose it just the same,
but it will be quicker and less painful.

01:31:42.414 --> 01:31:44.917
Those would be my
sentiments, in the office.

01:31:45.917 --> 01:31:48.170
But your home sentiments, your...

01:31:48.920 --> 01:31:50.422
Your Walworth sentiments?

01:31:51.548 --> 01:31:54.222
My Walworth sentiments...

01:31:55.010 --> 01:31:56.637
Would be...

01:31:58.054 --> 01:32:00.523
I'm gonna see what I can do.

How can I?

01:32:40.138 --> 01:32:42.578
I've seen him try to murder a man.
He might have murdered you.

HERBERT: And yet,
he risked his life to find you.

01:32:47.645 --> 01:32:50.273
He says I am the son he's never had.

01:32:50.857 --> 01:32:52.655
The idea appals me, Herbert,

01:32:54.319 --> 01:32:57.038
but even so, he must not be captured...

01:32:57.155 --> 01:32:58.657

01:33:01.534 --> 01:33:04.788

That's my life... Until I met my boy here.

01:33:16.091 --> 01:33:18.935
I've been done everything to except hanged.

01:33:19.677 --> 01:33:22.021
I've tramped and begged
and thieved, poached...

Anything that doesn't pay

01:33:26.184 --> 01:33:28.607

01:33:29.646 --> 01:33:33.025
when I was out of money and out of luck,
not that I'd been in it much,

01:33:33.691 --> 01:33:35.068
I met a man.

01:33:35.735 --> 01:33:37.282
At Epsom races.

01:33:38.029 --> 01:33:39.827
His name...

01:33:40.156 --> 01:33:41.282
Was Compeyson.

01:33:41.366 --> 01:33:43.289
- HERBERT: Compeyson?
- Compeyson.

01:33:45.453 --> 01:33:46.875
I'm sorry. Go on.

01:33:51.292 --> 01:33:54.887
<i>a smooth one, good-looking too,
went to boarding school.</i>

01:33:55.213 --> 01:33:59.969
<i>He was younger than me
but he'd got craft and he'd got learning.</i>

01:34:00.552 --> 01:34:02.725
<i>He and his missus had a plan...</i>

01:34:03.221 --> 01:34:07.567
Involving the defrauding of
a certain lady by her half-brother.

01:34:07.684 --> 01:34:10.858
It weren't much of a plan to my mind,
but I played my part...

01:34:11.729 --> 01:34:13.697
<i>I played my pan' in a small way.</i>

01:34:14.315 --> 01:34:15.692
<i>I can't say I'm proud of it.</i>

01:34:16.067 --> 01:34:17.660
Well done, Abel.

01:34:21.906 --> 01:34:23.874
I had a missus, too, at that time.

01:34:24.534 --> 01:34:26.411
- You were married?
- No matter.

01:34:35.712 --> 01:34:38.761
That was a dark time,
that time with Compeyson.

01:34:38.840 --> 01:34:41.637
Always in debt to him,
always under his thumb,

01:34:41.638 --> 01:34:43.307
always getting into danger,

01:34:43.428 --> 01:34:46.307
always working, for years and years,

01:34:46.890 --> 01:34:50.110
till I was his black slave.

01:34:55.690 --> 01:34:58.614
The short of it is, we got
committed for felony,

01:34:59.110 --> 01:35:01.454
putting forged notes into circulation.

01:35:01.529 --> 01:35:05.329

"No communication."

(LAUGHS)

01:35:06.492 --> 01:35:11.288

on my back so I could get Jaggers,

01:35:11.289 --> 01:35:13.005
for all the good it did me.

01:35:13.006 --> 01:35:14.546
Says the counsel for Compeyson,

01:35:14.626 --> 01:35:17.800
wasn't he the younger
and well brought up and of a good school?

01:35:17.962 --> 01:35:21.387
- Wasn't he...
- A gentleman of a county of Shropshire...

01:35:21.758 --> 01:35:22.805
A gentleman?

01:35:23.051 --> 01:35:26.055
BARRISTER: Given your persistence
and your malign influence...

01:35:26.137 --> 01:35:28.308
And when the verdict came,
wasn't it Compeyson

01:35:28.309 --> 01:35:31.480
<i>as was recommended for mercy
on account of good character</i>

01:35:31.559 --> 01:35:36.156
and bad company and all the damn'd lies
he'd given up against me?

01:35:36.689 --> 01:35:38.815

01:35:50.203 --> 01:35:52.001

He got two.

01:35:55.333 --> 01:35:58.177
And a few months on,
he turns up on my prison ship.

01:35:58.503 --> 01:36:01.097
I swore to the Lord, I'd
<i>smash</i> his face in...

01:36:02.298 --> 01:36:03.675
And I did.

01:36:03.967 --> 01:36:06.095
And then, thinking, hoping,
that he'd drowned,

01:36:06.177 --> 01:36:07.895
I swam to the shore

01:36:07.971 --> 01:36:11.475
and was hiding among the graves there,
envying them that were in them...

01:36:12.725 --> 01:36:14.853
And my boy here found me.

01:36:17.105 --> 01:36:18.322
My boy.

01:36:21.567 --> 01:36:22.693

01:36:31.160 --> 01:36:33.879

I would strongly advise your uncle

01:37:07.864 --> 01:37:09.948
If he's found, he will hang.

01:37:09.949 --> 01:37:12.828

Mr Compeyson does not wish him well.

01:37:23.921 --> 01:37:27.095

Who is this "she"?

01:37:44.108 --> 01:37:46.611
Magwitch and Molly had a child.

<i>A girl. A pretty thing.</i>

01:37:49.614 --> 01:37:52.618
<i>But Molly was a fierce one,
wild and passionate like her husband,</i>

01:37:53.076 --> 01:37:55.704
<i>and not a woman to let injustice
go unpunished.</i>

01:37:56.329 --> 01:37:58.548
<i>Compeyson, of course, was safe in prison.</i>

01:37:58.956 --> 01:38:01.129
<i>His wife, however, was not safe.</i>

01:38:01.209 --> 01:38:02.677
<i>Molly found her.</i>

assuming, of course, that Molly did it.

01:38:13.638 --> 01:38:18.690
But to be guilty and to be found guilty
are different things.

01:38:28.403 --> 01:38:32.374

01:38:33.491 --> 01:38:35.368

01:38:36.994 --> 01:38:41.215
And put the case that same legal
adviser holds a trust to find a child

01:38:41.332 --> 01:38:45.382
for an eccentric and rich woman
to adopt and bring up.

01:38:47.630 --> 01:38:52.852
Put the case that the legal adviser
said to the mother of the child...

01:38:53.970 --> 01:38:57.816
Give the child into my hands,
I will do my best to get you off.

If you are saved, your child is saved.

If you are lost, your child is still saved.

01:39:08.693 --> 01:39:11.697
And the child was your fee?

01:39:14.615 --> 01:39:16.538

- No! You say his name!

01:39:24.876 --> 01:39:29.177

one of the richest men in England.

01:39:43.311 --> 01:39:45.109

<i>Pip, believe me, when she first came to me,</i>

When we last met,

02:01:13.349 --> 02:01:15.069
you said that you would always think of me.

02:01:16.978 --> 02:01:18.355
And I have.

02:01:18.772 --> 02:01:21.571
- That you would think of the good in me.
- Always.

02:01:26.279 --> 02:01:27.781
You are a part of me, Estella.

02:01:28.740 --> 02:01:32.586
"You are in the ships", you said,
"And the river."

02:01:37.332 --> 02:01:39.084
I love you, Estella.

02:01:47.759 --> 02:01:49.056
I'm glad.
