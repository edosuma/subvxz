03:52.799 --> 03:55.134
- Here's that four-ten.
- Right.

04:03.810 --> 04:07.313
I been pumping pussy
since Christ was a corporal.

04:07.605 --> 04:12.110
<i>I can tell you, the best damned poontang
I ever paid for was in Da Nang.</i>

04:13.486 --> 04:15.321
The girls were checked out daily.

04:15.446 --> 04:19.450
<i>And we got ourselves laid in a safe,
orderly, proficient, military manner.</i>

04:20.451 --> 04:23.454
That is until some suckhead
writes home to mama...

04:23.621 --> 04:26.916
...and says he dipped his wick
in the Republic of South Vietnam.

04:28.459 --> 04:30.461
Then the shit hits the fan.

04:31.004 --> 04:34.257
<i>A committee of congressmen who,
asshole-to-asshole...</i>

04:34.340 --> 04:36.759
...couldn't make a beer fart
in a whirlwind...

04:36.843 --> 04:41.014
<i>... start telling your basic ass-in-the-grass
Marine, "No more shore time."</i>

04:41.973 --> 04:44.809
We respond in true Marine Corps fashion.

04:44.892 --> 04:49.272
<i>We salute, do an about face, double-time
back to the boom-boom garbage dump...</i>

04:50.148 --> 04:53.610
<i>... where we get the clap,
and the drip, and the crabs...</i>

04:54.193 --> 04:58.364
...and a generally poor attitude
towards the female of the species.

04:59.699 --> 05:01.701
<i>War is hell, boy. That's a fact.</i>

05:03.244 --> 05:04.996
I don't like soldier boys.

05:07.874 --> 05:09.125
Say what?

05:09.542 --> 05:14.047
<i>You want to pop that puppy's can, you
don't have to grease him so hard, jarhead.</i>

05:17.759 --> 05:19.844
Sounds like you're a man of experience.

05:20.470 --> 05:22.472
<i>What the fuck's that mean, grunt-shit?</i>

05:22.889 --> 05:26.893
<i>It means be advised
that I'm mean, nasty and tired.</i>

05:27.018 --> 05:29.354
I eat concertina wire and piss napalm...

05:29.479 --> 05:32.982
...and I can put a round through a flea's ass
at two hundred meters.

05:33.483 --> 05:37.153
<i>So go hump somebody else's leg,
mutt face, before I push yours in.</i>

05:37.487 --> 05:41.658
<i>You aren't going to be so smart with
your balls stuffed in your mouth, jarhead.</i>

05:44.911 --> 05:46.579
<i>Hang onto this, boy.</i>

05:47.121 --> 05:49.374
I think war's just been declared.

05:56.923 --> 06:00.385
Just sit there and bleed for a while
before you taste some real pain.

06:05.306 --> 06:08.393
Maybe first I carve me some faggot wings.

06:10.269 --> 06:11.521
Kill him.

06:31.457 --> 06:35.461
<i>Then again,
there was this dusky gal in Bangkok...</i>

06:35.837 --> 06:38.089
<i>... a real crossway breezer, I swear.</i>

06:40.550 --> 06:42.844
<i>Thank you for your testimony,
Officer Reese.</i>

06:48.358 --> 06:49.859
Sergeant Highway.

06:50.276 --> 06:52.612
Drunk and disorderly...

06:53.029 --> 06:55.365
...fighting in a public establishment...

06:56.074 --> 06:59.077
...urinating on a police vehicle.

07:05.542 --> 07:07.836
<i>It seemed like the thing to do, sir.</i>

07:12.048 --> 07:14.050
Just because there's no war going on...

07:14.134 --> 07:17.679
...it doesn't give you the right
to start one every time you get drunk.

07:18.972 --> 07:23.101
I'm taking into account
your excellent military record...

07:23.184 --> 07:26.312
...and your commitment
to the security of this great nation...

07:27.355 --> 07:31.609
...but this is your last chance.

07:34.028 --> 07:36.698
$100 fine. Next.

07:46.449 --> 07:48.785
<i>Your nightstick file for divorce, Reese?</i>

07:51.704 --> 07:54.707
<i>Who do you think you are,
pissing on my squad car?</i>

07:54.791 --> 07:57.669
You think you can break our rules
and just walk away?

07:57.919 --> 08:01.839
We're supposed to wet our pants over
your goddamned colored ribbons?

08:01.965 --> 08:04.175
<i>Read that file of yours sometime, hero.</i>

08:04.258 --> 08:06.928
Check the dates.
It's ancient fucking history.

08:07.220 --> 08:10.098
One night you're going to be
puking blood in some alley...

08:10.181 --> 08:12.892
...and you'll see me standing there.
Then we'll see.

08:12.976 --> 08:14.310
<i>Keep dreaming, shitball.</i>

08:14.394 --> 08:17.480
You'll pay full price.
I don't give any serviceman's discount.

08:17.563 --> 08:19.565
Too bad. Your old lady does.

08:31.786 --> 08:33.288
Just about cleaned you out.

08:34.664 --> 08:38.918
<i>Sure makes you feel good, doesn't it?
Helping Uncle Sam battle dirty drawers?</i>

08:39.001 --> 08:43.923
<i>Just pump the neighbor's dog, Jake?
Or are you always that slack-eyed and silly?</i>

08:44.006 --> 08:46.467
<i>Looks like you need a lift, Highway.</i>

08:46.551 --> 08:51.681
<i>Suck on one of these, smooth as a prom
queen's thighs only not quite so risky.</i>

08:52.348 --> 08:55.351
Havana cured.
Got a pal over in Guantanamo in Supply.

08:55.601 --> 08:57.186
We do each other favors.

08:57.437 --> 09:01.024
<i>I've got lots of friends. Of course,
I could always use another friend.</i>

09:01.357 --> 09:04.193
<i>- So we can do each other favors?
- Yes, sure.</i>

09:04.861 --> 09:09.866
<i>If your pencil wasn't quite so sharp, and
your eyesight not so clear around here...</i>

09:09.949 --> 09:15.163
...I could make your military life a lot
comfier and more rewarding.

09:16.539 --> 09:19.709
<i>Sergeant, you get that contraband stogie
out of my face...</i>

09:19.792 --> 09:24.339
<i>... before I shove it so far up your ass, you'll
have to set fire to your nose to light it.</i>

09:24.422 --> 09:27.050
<i>Gunney Highway,
Major Devin wants to see you, ASAP.</i>

09:32.956 --> 09:36.334
<i>- At ease. That'll be all, Sergeant Major.
- Aye, aye, sir.</i>

09:38.503 --> 09:39.879
<i>Highway, relax.</i>

09:40.463 --> 09:42.131
Stop being so gung-ho.

09:42.465 --> 09:44.133
<i>That's what I am, sir.</i>

09:46.302 --> 09:48.972
<i>What do you got now, about 24?</i>

09:49.305 --> 09:50.891
<i>And then some, sir.</i>

09:51.642 --> 09:55.312
Some men in your position
would look forward to retirement.

09:55.813 --> 09:59.149
Take their wives on
an around-the-world cruise.

09:59.400 --> 10:01.318
But that's not your way. Is it?

10:01.652 --> 10:06.490
You choose to harangue my staff
with a request for transfer to...

10:07.157 --> 10:09.033
...a Fleet Marine Force Unit.

10:10.285 --> 10:15.540
<i>The very unit you got busted out of for
insubordination, conduct unbecoming.</i>

10:16.457 --> 10:20.420
<i>That's true, Major. I have had
my differences with some limp dicks...</i>

10:20.503 --> 10:21.880
Highway!

10:23.506 --> 10:26.010
I don't know whether to admire you...

10:26.427 --> 10:28.637
...or resent the living hell out of you.

10:28.762 --> 10:33.017
<i>Either way, I guess it doesn't matter.
You're out of here, effective immediately.</i>

10:34.435 --> 10:35.978
<i>Where to, sir?</i>

10:37.771 --> 10:41.775
<i>2nd Recon Battalion, 2nd Marine Division.
You're going home.</i>

10:44.278 --> 10:45.529
<i>Aye, aye, sir.</i>

10:49.992 --> 10:51.243
Gunney Highway?

10:52.620 --> 10:53.662
Sir?

10:54.330 --> 10:57.124
Be careful what you wish for.
You might just get it.

11:02.214 --> 11:03.256
Halt!

11:04.758 --> 11:06.301
About face!

11:24.527 --> 11:26.820
<i>We're going to bring up
tonight's last victim.</i>

11:26.904 --> 11:28.864
<i>He's a true blood, born in New Jersey.</i>

11:28.948 --> 11:30.908
<i>He's the President of Punk.</i>

11:30.991 --> 11:32.785
<i>The Earl of Funk.</i>

11:32.868 --> 11:37.207
<i>The next king of rock and roll himself.
Ladies and gentlemen, Stitch Jones.</i>

11:53.181 --> 11:55.934
<i>Do I bother you while you're
playing romance the sheep?</i>

11:57.435 --> 11:59.729
<i>Why not bag the geeks
and keep America beautiful?</i>

11:59.813 --> 12:02.524
<i>Put a 10-gallon bag
over their 10-gallon heads.</i>

12:02.607 --> 12:04.109
Shall we take care of this?

12:05.443 --> 12:07.779
You look like
the Twin Towers turned to cellulite.

12:09.532 --> 12:12.118
I can play country-western.
Give me another chance.

12:12.201 --> 12:13.244
Oh yeah?

12:13.327 --> 12:16.831
<i>I know Merle Haggard, Hoss Cartwright,
The Beverly Hillbillies.</i>

12:16.956 --> 12:19.292
Give me another chance.
I need the money!

13:04.378 --> 13:06.797
- How far?
- About two stops.

13:45.086 --> 13:46.671
- Are you the maid?
- No.

13:46.754 --> 13:49.340
<i>I want the seat,
but it's not worth dying over.</i>

13:52.134 --> 13:55.848
<i>Liz and Dick, Lennon and McCartney,
even Ali and Frazier...</i>

13:56.181 --> 13:58.392
<i>... they worked it out. So can we, right?</i>

13:58.475 --> 14:01.436
Stitch Jones is the name.
Rocking and rapping is the game.

14:01.937 --> 14:03.480
<i>Pleased to meet you, too.</i>

14:03.939 --> 14:06.650
<i>I banged up my Corvette,
but I figure, what the hell...</i>

14:06.733 --> 14:09.778
...gives me a chance to get out
and meet the regular people.

14:09.862 --> 14:12.698
People like yourself. People like my fans.

14:12.948 --> 14:14.908
I'm a singer. You heard of me.

14:14.992 --> 14:18.912
<i>Stitch Jones: Earl of Funk, Duke of Cool,
Ayatollah of Rock-and-Roll-a.</i>

14:19.079 --> 14:20.664
<i>Shut your face, hippie.</i>

14:21.665 --> 14:23.250
Did you say "hippie"?

14:24.251 --> 14:26.795
Haven't been hippies
around here for centuries.

14:26.879 --> 14:29.132
You been freeze-dried or doing hard time?

14:32.760 --> 14:35.180
One of those would sure go down nice.

14:35.763 --> 14:38.349
<i>I'd buy one from you,
but I don't have my plastic.</i>

14:38.433 --> 14:40.935
Usually I get one of my lackeys
to do my business.

14:41.019 --> 14:44.355
You can have one for free
if it will shut that hole under your nose.

14:44.439 --> 14:45.731
<i>Thank you, my man.</i>

14:48.734 --> 14:49.902
Jones.

14:50.944 --> 14:54.740
This doesn't mean you can blow in my ear.
Tom Highway.

14:55.490 --> 14:57.534
These aren't your magazines.

14:58.619 --> 15:01.288
No. Somebody must've left them there.

15:02.706 --> 15:05.460
<i>The Sexual Politics of Living Alone.</i>

15:07.837 --> 15:09.797
<i>The Big Commitment and You.</i>

15:11.382 --> 15:12.842
<i>Island Erotics:</i>

15:13.301 --> 15:17.472
<i>How To Stay Tan, Tickly and Tantalized
in the Cool Waters of Jamaica.</i>

15:17.555 --> 15:18.973
<i>Not bad, man.</i>

15:24.979 --> 15:27.649
<i>Sunday Sex With a Wednesday Lover.</i>

15:27.899 --> 15:29.901
That sounds like a song.

15:31.027 --> 15:33.488
"I met her on a Wednesday
She was the best

15:33.696 --> 15:36.157
<i>"Come Sunday morning,
I needed rest</i>

15:36.824 --> 15:39.370
<i>"Because she didn't shave,
She didn't use Neet</i>

15:39.453 --> 15:41.747
"She tried to use my face as a bicycle seat"

15:43.040 --> 15:45.042
<i>Word, am I fresh?</i>

15:47.670 --> 15:52.007
She's got some angry titties.
Hostile projectiles.

15:52.299 --> 15:54.260
<i>Put your shit in there, get frostbite.</i>

15:54.343 --> 15:55.677
She isn't so bad.

15:56.427 --> 15:58.763
<i>You want to talk tonight, I'll listen.</i>

15:58.930 --> 16:03.601
Don't try to sell me on making love or
making music because I'm an authority.

16:03.852 --> 16:07.188
Born to screw and bred to sing. That's me.

16:07.522 --> 16:09.357
I must cut a few Z's myself.

16:09.524 --> 16:12.862
So keep down the chatter
while I get my beauty sleep.

16:25.332 --> 16:28.002
Yes. Groupies are fun
but you need your vitamins...

16:28.085 --> 16:30.045
...because those babes'll wear you out.

16:30.129 --> 16:32.506
<i>- Anything else, General?
- No. That's fine.</i>

16:34.383 --> 16:36.218
What are all those medals?

16:37.052 --> 16:40.055
<i>I'll never tell.
At least, not while the sun is shining.</i>

16:44.602 --> 16:46.437
This babe is whacked.

16:46.520 --> 16:49.733
She doesn't know what's
twelve inches long and white.

16:50.275 --> 16:51.067
Nothing.

16:53.528 --> 16:55.864
No offense. Just working on my routine.

16:55.947 --> 16:59.201
<i>I'll tell you what's black and bleeding,
if it don't shut up.</i>

16:59.284 --> 17:02.287
<i>Mellow, man. It's gonna be a nice day.</i>

17:05.998 --> 17:07.916
<i>Tell the driver, I'll be right out.</i>

17:08.000 --> 17:11.462
Don't worry. I'll use my plastic.
It's my treat for your hospitality.

17:11.921 --> 17:13.756
<i>Thanks, I'll get the tip.</i>

17:23.599 --> 17:25.435
My buddy will take care of that.

17:25.519 --> 17:29.272
He asked me to tell you that
there's no sunshine in the men's john.

17:42.369 --> 17:44.704
<i>I'm here, baby. Let's do some distance.</i>

17:56.466 --> 17:58.135
Son of a bitch.

18:39.719 --> 18:43.764
You're going to slurp my lifer's juice
out of my own cup?

18:45.725 --> 18:48.436
Yes. I guess I should have
gotten shots beforehand.

18:49.187 --> 18:53.441
<i>If your brain was as quick as your mouth,
you'd be a twenty-star general by now.</i>

18:53.691 --> 18:57.069
<i>If I was half as ugly as you,
Sergeant Major...</i>

18:57.361 --> 18:59.530
...I'd be a poster boy for a prophylactic.

19:00.114 --> 19:02.283
Still a mean and nasty bastard.

19:04.076 --> 19:07.581
<i>Goddamn! It's sure good to see you, Tom,
back where you belong.</i>

19:07.664 --> 19:10.209
Take it easy.
Everybody will think I'm spoken for.

19:13.337 --> 19:14.379
<i>'Morning, sir.</i>

19:15.214 --> 19:16.340
Sergeant Major?

19:16.882 --> 19:18.217
<i>Coffee, sir?</i>

19:19.760 --> 19:20.928
Negative.

19:21.303 --> 19:24.222
<i>Gunnery Sergeant Thomas Highway,
reporting for duty, sir.</i>

19:28.392 --> 19:32.688
<i>That Operation Officer's farthole is sewed
so tight, he shits out of his mouth.</i>

19:32.897 --> 19:33.940
Academy?

19:34.565 --> 19:36.275
Big-time football hero.

19:37.151 --> 19:39.070
When am I ever going to get a break?

19:39.362 --> 19:40.446
Never.

19:40.781 --> 19:42.824
- Sergeant Major?
- Sir!

19:43.075 --> 19:44.826
Bring in Gunnery Sergeant Highway.

19:58.215 --> 19:59.508
Been in a long time.

20:00.259 --> 20:02.344
<i>I've felt a little heat, sir.</i>

20:02.761 --> 20:06.598
Korea. Dominican in 1965.
Three tours of duty in Vietnam.

20:07.432 --> 20:09.893
This old bulldog is carrying
so much shrapnel...

20:09.977 --> 20:12.563
...he can't pass through
an airport metal detector.

20:13.188 --> 20:16.276
I haven't yet had the privilege of combat.

20:19.445 --> 20:22.282
I recently came over
from Supply and Logistics.

20:22.574 --> 20:25.285
<i>An unappreciated field of endeavor, sir.</i>

20:26.744 --> 20:27.912
Quite.

20:28.997 --> 20:31.708
My record of achievement thus far
has been exemplary...

20:32.584 --> 20:34.835
...and I fully intend for that to continue.

20:35.168 --> 20:36.211
Sir.

20:36.962 --> 20:40.299
I want this battalion to be
the class of the division.

20:40.841 --> 20:43.927
I expect my noncommissioned officers
to lead by example.

20:44.595 --> 20:47.639
Public fighting and insubordination
to civilian authority...

20:47.723 --> 20:49.892
...are not what I call "good standards."

20:50.602 --> 20:52.478
<i>It was a minor altercation, sir.</i>

20:52.562 --> 20:54.439
<i>You make a habit of that, Gunney.</i>

20:55.064 --> 20:57.275
A year ago you hit an officer.

20:57.775 --> 20:59.611
I went to Annapolis with that man.

20:59.694 --> 21:01.863
<i>You try that with me, Sergeant Highway...</i>

21:01.946 --> 21:05.783
<i>... and you'll drag your butt in a sling
for a month, understand?</i>

21:06.743 --> 21:07.911
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

21:08.828 --> 21:13.958
<i>I don't know what strings you pulled to
get here, but I assure you, I don't like it.</i>

21:14.459 --> 21:16.127
This is the new Marine Corps.

21:17.629 --> 21:19.297
The new breed.

21:19.839 --> 21:22.342
Characters like you are an anachronism.

21:23.468 --> 21:28.140
<i>You should be sealed in a case that reads,
"Break Glass Only in the Event of War."</i>

21:30.768 --> 21:35.773
I have no tolerance for you old-timers
who think you know better. Understand?

21:37.650 --> 21:41.862
<i>I understand a lot of body bags get
filled if I don't do my job, sir.</i>

21:42.904 --> 21:43.947
Major!

21:44.155 --> 21:48.743
Division has assigned Gunney Highway
to our Reconnaissance Platoon.

21:54.374 --> 21:55.708
<i>Yes, Recon.</i>

21:57.001 --> 22:00.464
<i>Their last sergeant was
an old-time combat vet, too.</i>

22:01.340 --> 22:03.342
But he went ROAD on me...

22:04.260 --> 22:06.053
..."Retired On Active Duty."

22:06.136 --> 22:08.931
<i>Had a few months to retirement,
figured he'd coast.</i>

22:09.515 --> 22:11.851
Allowed the men to lapse into mediocrity.

22:14.436 --> 22:17.857
<i>You're close to mandatory retirement
yourself. Aren't you, Highway?</i>

22:18.858 --> 22:20.693
<i>That's right, Major.</i>

22:23.362 --> 22:27.408
<i>I ask for Marines,
the division sends me relics.</i>

22:33.998 --> 22:37.669
<i>The men in Recon Platoon are less than
highly motivated, to say the least.</i>

22:38.253 --> 22:40.046
I want those men in shape.

22:40.714 --> 22:44.551
<i>I'll make life-takers
and heartbreakers out of them, sir.</i>

22:47.554 --> 22:48.889
Dismissed.

22:54.101 --> 22:57.354
<i>Is he always like that,
or is he trying to make a good impression?</i>

22:57.438 --> 23:00.983
He even consults the Marine Corps manual
before he mounts his old lady...

23:01.066 --> 23:04.612
<i>... just to insure he performs in an orderly,
proficient, military manner.</i>

23:04.778 --> 23:07.615
Chow with Helen and me tonight.
She can't wait to see you.

23:07.698 --> 23:10.744
<i>Later, we can stomp some brain cells
and tell some stories.</i>

23:10.827 --> 23:14.748
<i>- I'd like to, but I'd better get organized.
- Sure. I understand.</i>

23:16.583 --> 23:18.418
<i>Excuse me, sir.</i>

23:18.960 --> 23:21.963
<i>I mean, Gunney. Sergeant Major.</i>

23:22.255 --> 23:26.051
<i>Sir, this is Gunnery Sergeant Highway.
He's been assigned to Recon Platoon.</i>

23:26.134 --> 23:27.802
Outstanding! Welcome aboard.

23:28.678 --> 23:32.516
I have to hightail it.
I'm late for pre-scuba school.

23:35.143 --> 23:36.937
His mama know he's playing Marine?

23:37.437 --> 23:40.524
<i>By the way, he's Lieutenant Ring.
Your platoon leader.</i>

23:41.441 --> 23:42.609
Thanks a lot.

23:42.859 --> 23:46.697
You think you were just going to tilt nipple
to a bunch of no-rank fuzzbutts?

23:46.781 --> 23:48.783
Want me to intro you to your troops?

23:48.866 --> 23:51.369
- No. I'll take care of it.
- Take my pickup.

23:51.577 --> 23:53.162
Thanks. Where is it?

23:53.746 --> 23:56.666
<i>You just tell by the sign.
It says, "Sergeant Major."</i>

24:10.345 --> 24:14.516
- Is this Recon Platoon?
- No speak English.

24:15.267 --> 24:17.352
<i>- You?
- No habla.</i>

24:46.924 --> 24:49.051
My name is Gunnery Sergeant Highway.

24:49.510 --> 24:54.349
<i>I've drunk more beer, pissed more blood,
banged more quiff, busted more balls...</i>

24:56.101 --> 24:58.437
...than all you numbnuts put together.

24:58.604 --> 25:01.648
Major Powers has put me in charge
of this Recon Platoon.

25:01.732 --> 25:03.233
We take care of ourselves!

25:03.567 --> 25:05.903
You couldn't take care of a wet dream.

25:06.236 --> 25:08.447
- God loves you.
- I know that.

25:08.530 --> 25:10.157
You men do not impress me!

25:11.073 --> 25:13.576
Recon Platoon kicks butt!

25:16.204 --> 25:20.917
You think you can slip and slide just
because your last sergeant was a pussy...

25:21.000 --> 25:23.419
...a short-timer just marking the days.

25:24.295 --> 25:27.006
<i>You're going to start acting like Marines,
right now.</i>

25:27.215 --> 25:28.675
Who invited you?

25:28.759 --> 25:32.679
I'm not doing this because I want to take
long showers with you assholes.

25:32.763 --> 25:36.683
And I don't want to get my head shot off
in some faraway land...

25:36.767 --> 25:39.853
<i>... because you don't habla. Comprende?
- Right!</i>

25:40.479 --> 25:41.813
<i>- You?
- Yes, Gunney!</i>

25:42.064 --> 25:44.900
<i>"Girl, you know I think you're fine</i>

25:44.983 --> 25:48.320
"and you've got that big behind"

25:57.371 --> 25:59.456
<i>Well, well, well.</i>

26:02.209 --> 26:07.131
I'm here to tell you all
that life as you know it has ended.

26:08.675 --> 26:10.927
You should all go to town tonight.

26:11.261 --> 26:13.346
Laugh and make fools of yourselves.

26:13.596 --> 26:17.976
<i>Rub your little peckers against your honey,
or stick it in a knothole in a fence...</i>

26:18.059 --> 26:21.645
<i>... but whatever it is, just get rid of it.
Because at 0600 tomorrow...</i>

26:22.938 --> 26:24.940
...your ass is mine.

26:25.023 --> 26:26.191
Where's your bunk?

26:30.946 --> 26:32.447
What's going on?

26:44.377 --> 26:46.713
- Let's have it.
- What are you talking about?

26:46.796 --> 26:49.465
- The money from my ticket.
- No need to use violence.

26:49.716 --> 26:51.718
<i>I'm a Capricorn, a peace lover.</i>

26:51.885 --> 26:54.554
I was just a little down on my luck.

26:54.971 --> 26:58.474
I got some money right here. It's all I got.

26:58.600 --> 27:00.018
And the meal.

27:00.101 --> 27:01.436
- Meal?
- Yes. The meal.

27:03.313 --> 27:06.065
- That's really all I've got. Right there.
- And the tip.

27:06.149 --> 27:08.484
- No. That's really it!
- You owe me.

27:11.237 --> 27:15.075
<i>It's my will against yours,
and you will lose.</i>

27:15.492 --> 27:17.077
So 0600 tomorrow.

27:17.745 --> 27:21.916
<i>That's 6:00 in the morning
for all you people who don't habla.</i>

27:23.375 --> 27:25.961
Damn! He just tore off my ear!

27:26.045 --> 27:29.173
He's lucky he had a chance to escape
before I kicked his ass...

27:29.256 --> 27:31.925
<i>... big leatherneck, jarhead motherfucker!</i>

27:32.091 --> 27:34.802
Something must be done
about this Gunney Highway.

27:34.886 --> 27:36.638
Yes! But what are we going to do?

27:36.888 --> 27:41.017
- Wait till the Swede gets out of the brig!
- That's it! The Swede!

27:41.184 --> 27:44.562
- Yes! He'll rip his head off and dump in it!
- Then he'll eat it!

27:44.646 --> 27:47.316
<i>- Yes!
- The Swede! Goodbye, Highway!</i>

27:47.691 --> 27:51.028
Swede! Swede! Swede!

28:04.250 --> 28:05.584
<i>Hey, baby.</i>

28:05.709 --> 28:07.002
I called his wife...

28:07.253 --> 28:09.505
Do you fool around on the first date?

28:19.265 --> 28:21.601
Damn you.
Don't you know how to write or call?

28:21.685 --> 28:25.021
I didn't want to cause you any
sleepless nights thinking about me.

28:25.313 --> 28:28.316
- I'll get you a beer.
- Great. I could use one.

28:31.069 --> 28:35.115
<i>You look great. They don't make them
like you anymore, sweetheart.</i>

28:36.741 --> 28:38.285
<i>Hell, sure they do.</i>

28:39.159 --> 28:42.872
<i>But if you want a lot from a woman,
you have to give a lot.</i>

28:43.247 --> 28:45.082
<i>No, not this kid.</i>

28:45.374 --> 28:48.627
It seems marriage and the Marine Corps
weren't too compatible.

28:48.836 --> 28:52.840
Panther piss. The best years of my life
were with a Marine.

28:53.173 --> 28:57.262
<i>If I was a little younger, I'd make you
eat your words, and curl your toes.</i>

28:57.929 --> 28:59.139
I'll bet you could.

29:00.265 --> 29:02.434
Aggie always kept a smile on your face.

29:03.018 --> 29:04.519
That was pain.

29:05.270 --> 29:06.771
<i>Tom, she's in town.</i>

29:11.109 --> 29:12.569
I figured as much.

29:13.195 --> 29:16.031
<i>If she wants more alimony,
she's in trouble.</i>

29:16.615 --> 29:21.119
<i>I'm so broke, I couldn't leave if it
took a quarter to go around the world.</i>

29:21.536 --> 29:23.872
She's cocktailing over at the Palace.

29:25.248 --> 29:28.418
I figured she'd be married
to a general by now.

29:31.297 --> 29:32.965
Can I get my old room back?

29:33.341 --> 29:35.343
<i>Hell, yes. You going to see her?</i>

29:35.426 --> 29:37.511
<i>Hell, no. Can I run a tab on this?</i>

29:37.678 --> 29:38.804
<i>Hell, no.</i>

30:08.668 --> 30:11.796
<i>And now,
back from an awesomely successful tour...</i>

30:11.921 --> 30:15.258
<i>... the Earl of Funk, the Duke of Cool...</i>

30:16.008 --> 30:20.429
<i>... the Ayatollah of Rock-and-Roll-a,
Stitch Jones!</i>

31:22.910 --> 31:24.411
<i>Okay, what will it...</i>

31:26.663 --> 31:27.915
Aggie.

31:30.334 --> 31:32.377
- What do you want?
- A beer.

31:33.545 --> 31:36.215
- What are you doing here?
- Ordering.

31:58.363 --> 31:59.989
You even remembered the brand.

32:00.698 --> 32:03.785
<i>Bad whiskey, bad sex and bad men,
I never forget.</i>

32:04.911 --> 32:07.163
You didn't talk dirty
when we were married.

32:07.829 --> 32:10.666
Always. Only you were
never there to hear it.

32:13.377 --> 32:15.045
<i>Look, Tom, I'm working.</i>

32:15.837 --> 32:18.382
- You look great.
- The lights are low.

32:19.132 --> 32:22.052
I mean it.
I'd recognize you coming and going.

32:22.177 --> 32:24.346
<i>Please, save the banter for your bimbos.</i>

32:24.722 --> 32:27.976
It's late. I'm tired. My feet hurt.
What are you doing here?

32:28.726 --> 32:30.436
I'm back with Recon.

32:30.728 --> 32:34.148
And you just happened to wander in here?
Ain't life grand?

32:34.232 --> 32:38.194
- I didn't come here to fight with you.
- You mean old dogs do learn new tricks?

32:38.361 --> 32:42.073
I just came for a beer
and you're ragging my ass already.

32:43.074 --> 32:44.951
<i>Aggie, is there a problem here?</i>

32:46.035 --> 32:47.078
No.

32:47.829 --> 32:52.125
I'd like you to meet one of my favorite
exes. This is Thomas Highway.

32:52.208 --> 32:54.377
This is Roy Jennings. He owns the Palace.

32:57.922 --> 33:00.801
I've heard about you
and your bullshit heroics.

33:00.885 --> 33:04.430
<i>Now, Roy, Tom is just going to leave.</i>

33:08.934 --> 33:11.270
<i>Aggie, I'll take you home after we close...</i>

33:13.856 --> 33:15.191
...as usual.

33:23.740 --> 33:25.825
You sure can pick them.

33:26.951 --> 33:28.620
Look who's talking.

33:48.057 --> 33:52.520
I'm going to play something from NYC.
I want all of you to rock the house.

33:52.603 --> 33:54.939
Fuck rock! Get your hair cut!

33:58.150 --> 34:01.737
<i>You're so ugly, you should be
at the airport, sniffing luggage!</i>

34:02.571 --> 34:04.365
I guess you think you're funny?

34:05.533 --> 34:08.327
<i>All of you, cross your legs,
hold your noses, and fart.</i>

34:08.409 --> 34:10.956
- I bet you could clear out your minds!
- Say what?

34:13.208 --> 34:15.668
Don't start no S-H.
There won't be no I-T.

34:15.752 --> 34:17.420
We have some pretty ladies here.

34:17.670 --> 34:20.507
Come have a drink with the nation's finest.

34:21.632 --> 34:22.676
Chill out.

34:24.052 --> 34:27.554
<i>Knock it off! Knock it off, goddamn it!</i>

34:27.972 --> 34:29.181
Sit down!

34:29.264 --> 34:31.559
<i>Lay off them, they're not hurting anyone.</i>

34:31.641 --> 34:34.770
- Why don't you stay out of this?
- This is none of your business.

34:34.853 --> 34:36.688
Are you some kind of smart mouth?

34:37.398 --> 34:39.233
I'm just trying to sing a song here.

34:39.315 --> 34:41.025
You get off on rousting Marines?

34:41.360 --> 34:43.530
Leave it alone. It doesn't concern you.

34:43.612 --> 34:45.614
I chew on jarheads and spit them out.

34:45.949 --> 34:50.453
You do? Why don't I just bend you over
that table and nail you in the keister?

34:50.661 --> 34:52.163
What are you talking about?

34:52.289 --> 34:54.875
That's what your persuasion is.
You just said so.

34:54.958 --> 34:58.253
I'll send you home with an
"l-just-pumped-the-neighbor's-cat"...

34:58.336 --> 34:59.379
...look on your face.

35:01.381 --> 35:02.841
What kind of fag talk is that?

35:03.300 --> 35:04.968
You have no right to do this!

35:05.427 --> 35:07.429
He's just fucking with you.

35:07.554 --> 35:09.306
These guys don't mean nothing.

35:09.556 --> 35:12.893
Who'd have the bad sense to fuck with
you in your own place?

35:12.976 --> 35:14.978
Welcome to Fantasy Disco.

35:15.979 --> 35:17.647
To hell with both of you.

35:19.734 --> 35:22.236
<i>You're out, Jones. Hit the road.</i>

35:22.653 --> 35:24.822
<i>And you watch it, funny man.</i>

35:26.657 --> 35:28.826
Get your tight little butt out of here.

35:35.458 --> 35:37.792
I never want to see you here again.

35:38.835 --> 35:41.171
<i>I have got a future here, damn it!</i>

35:41.254 --> 35:43.882
- Cocktailing?
- No! With Roy!

35:44.633 --> 35:47.928
I expect a hell of a lot better out of
an ex-wife of mine.

35:48.011 --> 35:49.971
He's an improvement over you!

35:57.438 --> 35:59.273
I don't believe this shit!

35:59.482 --> 36:02.652
<i>I'd have kicked Jennings' ass,
if I wasn't trying to protect you.</i>

36:03.986 --> 36:06.656
So you owe me one. I saved your life.

36:07.532 --> 36:10.535
This doesn't mean we'll be
swapping spit in the shower.

36:12.537 --> 36:14.872
Fucking big jarhead sucker.

36:16.624 --> 36:18.960
Drop your cocks and grab your socks.

36:19.377 --> 36:21.712
Off your ass and on your feet. Get up!

36:22.213 --> 36:24.215
Knees in the breeze in five minutes.

36:24.465 --> 36:26.801
<i>It's 5:00 a.m.! You said, 6:00 a.m.</i>

36:26.884 --> 36:28.720
So I can't tell time.

36:29.012 --> 36:33.684
Maybe some commie bastard's coming to
pop you a new asshole in the forehead.

36:34.059 --> 36:38.397
Move out! You're Marines now.
You improvise. You adapt. You overcome.

36:38.647 --> 36:40.315
Four minutes. Fall out.

36:43.986 --> 36:47.071
We move swift. We move silent.
We move deadly.

36:47.154 --> 36:48.739
Only one shake of the whangs.

36:48.823 --> 36:52.368
<i>Any more than that constitutes pleasure,
and we're not in that business.</i>

36:52.451 --> 36:53.911
<i>Sleep well, Mr. Jones?</i>

36:53.995 --> 36:57.164
<i>It's a nightmare.
Wake me up, Mama, please!</i>

37:00.418 --> 37:03.422
<i>- Gunney, platoon's formed for PT.
- Take your post.</i>

37:06.842 --> 37:10.012
The Marines are looking
for a few good men.

37:10.762 --> 37:12.723
<i>Unfortunately, you aren't it.</i>

37:15.434 --> 37:18.437
We will blaze a path into battle
for others to follow.

37:18.854 --> 37:21.106
Surrender is not in our creed.

37:21.231 --> 37:22.566
Let's hear you say that.

37:22.941 --> 37:24.693
Surrender is not in our creed.

37:26.528 --> 37:30.282
<i>Louder, or next time you leave this base,
you'll be collecting pensions.</i>

37:31.200 --> 37:33.285
- Surrender is not in our creed!
- Louder!

37:40.793 --> 37:42.587
- What?
- What is he talking about?

37:43.129 --> 37:45.632

or none at all.</i>

38:14.577 --> 38:18.915
<i>You shouldn't litter, Fag-eddy.
It's ecologically unsound.</i>

38:22.335 --> 38:24.712
- What's your name?
- Aponte.

38:24.963 --> 38:26.297
- Yours?
- Profile.

38:26.381 --> 38:27.549
- Yours?
- Quinones.

38:40.395 --> 38:41.813
You look like models.

38:41.896 --> 38:44.899
<i>In fact, I want your hair high and tight
tomorrow morning.</i>

38:44.983 --> 38:46.694
That's everybody.

<i>When you start looking like Marines,
you'll start feeling like Marines.</i>

38:50.531 --> 38:53.492
<i>Then, goddamn it,
you'll start acting like Marines.</i>

38:53.576 --> 38:55.578
Right face! Forward march!

39:17.473 --> 39:21.144
<i>When the Swede gets out of the brig,
this sucker is dead meat!</i>

39:21.478 --> 39:23.397
- You got that right.
- Right.

<i>"Mama, Mama, can't you see?</i>

39:34.533 --> 39:36.744

<i>All right, let's smoke this sucker's ass.</i>

41:43.497 --> 41:46.459
'Morning. Missed you
and Recon Platoon at PT.

41:46.918 --> 41:48.920
The men and I were getting acquainted.

41:49.170 --> 41:50.338
Excellent.

41:50.504 --> 41:53.424
I want to freelance them for awhile
to evaluate them.

41:54.091 --> 41:58.095
There are no special duties
in the training schedule. Shall I join you?

41:58.179 --> 42:00.681
You must have important work here.

42:00.932 --> 42:05.770
<i>Actually, I am preparing a paper on tactics
and strategy for the War Club Seminar.</i>

42:06.521 --> 42:08.856
It's fascinating stuff.

42:08.981 --> 42:11.067
I don't know if the Major told you...

42:11.442 --> 42:14.779
...I was Commanding Officer
of my ROTC detachment in college.

42:16.698 --> 42:19.368
<i>I'll sleep better at night
knowing that, sir.</i>

42:19.618 --> 42:21.703
Thank you. What college did you go to?

42:23.330 --> 42:24.998
Heartbreak Ridge.

42:27.000 --> 42:31.004
Heartbreak Ridge?
I've never heard of that school.

43:02.411 --> 43:04.913
That looks nice. Real nice.

43:08.333 --> 43:09.668
Slick.

43:11.336 --> 43:13.505
Smells like a Ben Gay factory.

43:14.756 --> 43:16.425
Strip off those t-shirts.

43:16.633 --> 43:17.968
We're all the same!

43:18.260 --> 43:19.344
The same as me?

43:19.678 --> 43:21.430
How can we know that?

43:21.513 --> 43:25.768
Improvise. Overcome. Adapt.
Get off those goddamned t-shirts now!

43:31.441 --> 43:32.942
<i>Platoon, right face!</i>

43:33.651 --> 43:35.320
Forward march!

43:46.955 --> 43:49.666
Rethink. You might get away with
that with Tyler...

43:49.750 --> 43:52.127
...but this cat? He's nuts. He'll catch you.

43:54.171 --> 43:55.839
Don't worry yourself.

43:56.089 --> 43:58.675
<i>The Few, the Proud, the Chumps.</i>

44:10.772 --> 44:15.276
Big light-bulb head must have a key
to the PX. Any better ideas?

44:22.367 --> 44:23.952
Where's Aponte?

44:24.494 --> 44:26.162
<i>Gunney, he's sick.</i>

44:26.246 --> 44:30.041
He looked like proof of life after death.
He's getting checked out.

44:30.124 --> 44:32.168
<i>- That right?
- Yes, that's right, Gunney.</i>

44:33.545 --> 44:37.800
I want the barracks field dayed and
squared away ASAP today.

44:37.883 --> 44:40.553
<i>Gunney, we cleaned them
just a little while ago.</i>

44:40.719 --> 44:42.721
<i>Yes, Gunney, it's Saturday.</i>

<i>Let's have a show of hands, how many
think the squad bay is ready to go as is?</i>

44:49.603 --> 44:52.939
- Definitely!
- There you have it. Democracy in action.

44:53.356 --> 44:55.316
- Right!
- We'll run instead.

44:55.441 --> 44:56.484
Attention!

44:57.193 --> 44:58.278
Right face!

44:59.028 --> 45:00.071
Forward march!

45:02.282 --> 45:03.324
Double time!

45:26.891 --> 45:27.933
- Shit!
- Out of my way!

45:29.476 --> 45:30.519
What's going on?

45:31.353 --> 45:34.940
<i>This is the AK-47 assault rifle.
Your enemy's preferred weapon.</i>

45:35.024 --> 45:39.028
<i>It makes a distinctive sound
when fired at you, so remember it.</i>

45:43.115 --> 45:44.451
Move out.

45:50.665 --> 45:55.503
<i>That is bullshit, man. He is dogging us.
He's shooting at us, scraping at us.</i>

45:58.173 --> 45:59.216
I know!

46:01.091 --> 46:04.053
Look at the way
he's always squinting his eyes...

46:04.136 --> 46:05.971
...trying to talk all tough.

46:06.597 --> 46:09.516
<i>I should slap him myself,
just to call his bluff.</i>

46:09.600 --> 46:12.770
Don't do that! He's just a jarhead fool.

<i>"You're right,

<i>Highway, I heard you were back.</i>

47:36.522 --> 47:37.565
Webster.

47:37.732 --> 47:40.943
These retards couldn't fight their way
out of a shithouse.

47:41.527 --> 47:43.779
Is that where
you've been keeping yourself?

47:43.863 --> 47:47.325
The Major and I are building an elite
company of fighting men.

47:48.201 --> 47:51.871
<i>The only thing you could build, Webster,
is a good case of hemorrhoids.</i>

47:59.921 --> 48:03.342
- What?
- You're blowing away all your ammunition.

48:03.425 --> 48:07.721
Mr. I-Hate-Americans is going to make you
into Swiss cheese. Slow down your fire.

48:07.804 --> 48:11.391
It's not my fucking fault!
The fucking weapon is fucking fucked up!

48:19.316 --> 48:22.318
Nothing is wrong with that rifle.
Keep it tight.

48:27.698 --> 48:30.576
Did you wake up this morning
with a piss pot on your head?

48:31.869 --> 48:34.247
<i>No, Gunney. I wore this in your honor.</i>

48:34.914 --> 48:36.499
- Is that so?
- Yes.

48:36.582 --> 48:40.837
<i>I figured, this is a classic piece of issue,
Iwo Jima, Pork Chop Hill, Khe Sahn...</i>

48:40.921 --> 48:42.714
...all that old antique stuff.

48:42.798 --> 48:47.594
A nice tribute to an aging veteran
as close to retirement as yourself.

48:48.136 --> 48:49.429
I'm touched.

48:49.513 --> 48:53.225
<i>Yes! Recon way of saying welcome,
and inevitably, goodbye.</i>

48:54.309 --> 48:56.645
And the Kevlar helmet you were issued...

48:56.853 --> 49:01.149
<i>... that didn't, by chance, find its way into
one of the local pawn shops in town?</i>

49:02.693 --> 49:05.195
<i>No way, Gunney.
That's a serious implication.</i>

49:05.529 --> 49:09.157
- We're financially responsible for them.
- That's right. You are.

49:09.449 --> 49:12.704
That's why I want to see Kevlar
on your head by 1900 hours...

49:12.787 --> 49:15.456
...or you're not going to have
a head to wear it on.

49:16.416 --> 49:18.668
<i>Yes, sir, Gunney Highway, Sergeant, sir.</i>

49:20.044 --> 49:22.213
<i>Gunney, my weapon's jammed.</i>

49:25.341 --> 49:27.594
- What the...
- Shit!

49:51.075 --> 49:54.162
Major Powers is going to teach you
how to discipline your men.

49:54.245 --> 49:58.249
<i>If Powers ever stopped suddenly,
your face would go halfway up his ass.</i>

50:02.587 --> 50:04.839
Profile is never going to make it back.

50:04.923 --> 50:06.674
Powers is cold-blooded.

50:21.815 --> 50:25.236
Don't give the prick the satisfaction.
You can make it.

50:27.947 --> 50:30.032
Recon!

50:33.410 --> 50:35.371
<i>What did you say, Gunnery Sergeant?</i>

50:35.454 --> 50:39.624
<i>I said,
"Don't give the prick the satisfaction," sir.</i>

50:45.380 --> 50:49.634
"Sensitive dialogue during
a communication of the relationship."

50:56.892 --> 50:59.395
- Follow you home?
- Sure. Why not?

51:25.504 --> 51:28.424
Somebody just look outside
and see what shirt he's wearing.

51:28.507 --> 51:32.178
It doesn't matter.
He'll just complain about something else.

51:32.262 --> 51:35.056
Life was a lot easier
before Frankenstein came.

51:35.140 --> 51:36.182
Right!

51:36.349 --> 51:38.768
<i>How am I going to play
on American Bandstand?</i>

51:38.852 --> 51:42.022
All of this macho soldiering shit
is bad for my hands.

51:42.105 --> 51:43.440
<i>People, fall out.</i>

51:47.444 --> 51:49.570
<i>I said, fall out! Now!</i>

51:51.947 --> 51:53.490
We're not going anywhere.

51:53.991 --> 51:56.660
All this play-war stuff is bullshit.

51:58.787 --> 52:01.040
This is all a question of mind over matter.

52:01.123 --> 52:03.500
We no longer mind
because you don't matter.

52:05.337 --> 52:07.505
You've been voted out of office.

52:08.798 --> 52:14.012
<i>Mr. Jones, you fall out on that street,
or I'll kick your ass off this planet.</i>

52:15.222 --> 52:17.224
<i>I don't think so, babe. Swede?</i>

52:28.860 --> 52:31.905
<i>Gunney, I'd like you to meet my big friend,
Swede Johanson.</i>

52:38.537 --> 52:40.665
<i>Swede, say something charming
to the man.</i>

52:40.915 --> 52:43.668
I'm going to rip off your head
and shit down your neck.

52:46.504 --> 52:50.174
<i>So you see, Grungy Highway,
we don't have any use for you anymore.</i>

52:50.341 --> 52:51.801
<i>"Hit the road, Jack!</i>

52:51.884 --> 52:56.681
<i>"And don't you come back
No more, no more"</i>

53:05.105 --> 53:06.356
Stick your chin up.

53:07.899 --> 53:09.067
Higher!

53:17.535 --> 53:21.622
<i>Now get your ass out on that street, ladies.
Right this second!</i>

53:23.958 --> 53:26.294
<i>I'll speak to you later, Swede.</i>

53:36.178 --> 53:38.514
<i>Sir, I'll wait outside for the MPs to come.</i>

53:38.598 --> 53:41.767
<i>Negative, Johanson. You're going
to become a Marine, right now.</i>

53:43.060 --> 53:45.062
<i>- Fall out.
- Yes, sir.</i>

53:48.149 --> 53:49.943
<i>Good morning, men!</i>

53:50.485 --> 53:52.821
I thought I'd lead you through this exercise.

53:54.615 --> 53:56.658
<i>I couldn't find Gunney Highway, though.</i>

53:57.284 --> 53:58.952
I don't know where he went.

54:16.093 --> 54:18.346
<i>Good Lord, what was that?</i>

54:18.554 --> 54:21.682
<i>Sir, that's an AK-47 assault weapon.</i>

54:22.391 --> 54:24.228
The preferred weapon of our enemies.

54:24.311 --> 54:27.648
<i>It makes a very distinctive sound
when fired at us, sir.</i>

54:29.107 --> 54:30.651
<i>Yes, it does. Doesn't it?</i>

54:32.152 --> 54:33.195
<i>Good night, Roy.</i>

54:35.322 --> 54:37.324
<i>Hold up, Aggie. I'll follow you home.</i>

54:37.616 --> 54:39.785
No. You go ahead. I've got some pains.

54:42.329 --> 54:44.456
<i>- I got it.
- Not tonight, you don't.</i>

54:53.757 --> 54:56.552
<i>"The sensual communication,
meaningful..."</i>

54:57.386 --> 54:58.720
Panther piss.

54:59.472 --> 55:03.685
Glad to know some things don't change.
Still know what a woman loves to hear.

55:05.979 --> 55:08.147
I just happened to be in the neighborhood.

55:08.773 --> 55:11.609
I thought maybe you'd like to sit down
and we could talk.

55:11.693 --> 55:13.945
Are you reading those magazines?

55:14.779 --> 55:17.072
- What magazines?
- Those magazines.

55:20.784 --> 55:23.453
Somebody must have left them here.

55:23.537 --> 55:24.538
Who?

55:24.872 --> 55:27.249
- Choozoo.
- He doesn't know how to read.

55:27.374 --> 55:30.460
Quit being so stubborn.
Why don't you sit down so we can talk?

55:30.544 --> 55:33.046
I am not one of your troops
that can be bullied.

55:35.925 --> 55:38.011
Was being married to me that bad?

55:38.511 --> 55:39.679
Yes.

55:46.227 --> 55:48.187
Platoon. Attention!

55:51.357 --> 55:52.567
<i>Thank you, Gunney!</i>

55:52.650 --> 55:55.111
What a fine morning for a military exercise.

55:55.570 --> 55:56.738
Men...

55:57.030 --> 56:01.034
...today we will execute an ambush against
a numerically superior hostile force...

56:01.951 --> 56:06.247
<i>... by using cover, surprise,
interlocking fields of fire...</i>

56:06.539 --> 56:09.585
...and the natural aggressiveness
of the United States Marine.

56:09.668 --> 56:12.504
<i>Show me some poontang,
I'll show you an aggressive Marine!</i>

56:12.588 --> 56:15.174
We'll provide Major Powers
and his elite force...

56:15.257 --> 56:18.219
...an accessible target
to sharpen their superior skills.

56:18.761 --> 56:21.889
This will be facilitated by
the MILES Gear each team will wear.

56:21.972 --> 56:26.434
<i>When one of our men is shot, these
laser-sensitive vests emit a beeping noise.</i>

56:28.102 --> 56:31.940
<i>Excuse me, Lieutenant?
Are you hinting that we don't fight back?</i>

56:32.857 --> 56:36.569
<i>Yes, Gunney. The Major likes to use
the Recon Platoon as a training tool.</i>

56:36.736 --> 56:40.114
What happens when these men go
into combat and they're not prepared?

56:40.198 --> 56:42.075
They just get dead.

56:43.202 --> 56:44.620
Yes. I see what you mean.

56:44.703 --> 56:46.956
Did you discuss this with Major Powers?

56:51.210 --> 56:54.463
<i>- Let's move them out, Gunney.
- Are you coming with us, Lieutenant?</i>

56:56.423 --> 56:59.260
<i>No, Gunney.
I have a doctor's appointment at 1100.</i>

56:59.343 --> 57:02.304
I hope it's nothing that will keep you
out of the next war.

57:03.222 --> 57:05.474
<i>Platoon, right face.</i>

57:07.226 --> 57:09.061
Sling arms.

57:09.853 --> 57:11.855
Forward march.

57:29.165 --> 57:31.543
Are you sure Highway's our man
to run the ambush?

57:31.626 --> 57:34.129
He's the best I know at small unit tactics.

57:34.212 --> 57:35.546
I doubt that.

57:42.887 --> 57:46.891
<i>Marines, today we're going to kick
some Recon ass.</i>

57:50.060 --> 57:53.356
Attention! About face!

57:54.024 --> 57:55.233
Forward march!

58:10.290 --> 58:12.375
When I first joined the Corps...

58:12.459 --> 58:16.504
<i>... I thought I'd be jumping out of planes,
and fighting the enemy.</i>

58:16.588 --> 58:20.508
<i>This is the new, modern, mechanized
Marine Corps. We'll jump out of our heads.</i>

58:20.592 --> 58:22.719
The only enemy we're fighting is boredom.

58:22.802 --> 58:25.263
<i>You hear that voice?
It's calling me, Hollywood.</i>

58:25.347 --> 58:28.100
Stitch Jones is going be
a rock and roll star.

58:28.184 --> 58:30.394
Don't forget us when you
make it to the top.

58:30.478 --> 58:33.898
<i>Front row center seat, and all the girls
I can't eat for my homeboy.</i>

58:33.981 --> 58:35.650
I love leftovers.

58:36.359 --> 58:38.986
Unsling your rifles.
You're making too much noise.

58:39.070 --> 58:43.074
Why? We're not supposed to win.
He watches too much prime time.

58:53.375 --> 58:55.418
<i>- What was that?
- You're dead, Marine.</i>

58:56.127 --> 58:59.047
You tripped on four booby traps
that blew your legs off...

58:59.130 --> 59:03.219
...and we have to send out a search party
for your testicles. Where's your backup?

59:03.761 --> 59:04.845
Profile.

59:06.264 --> 59:09.934
<i>What good are you back there?
Without any cover fire, I get shot.</i>

59:10.101 --> 59:14.146
<i>While you guys pump the dog,
we get everyone in this platoon killed.</i>

59:14.230 --> 59:16.315
Chill out. That's what we're here for.

59:16.524 --> 59:17.692
Say what?

59:17.775 --> 59:20.903
<i>We've ambushed Major Powers
three times, and always right here.</i>

59:20.987 --> 59:22.405
We know what we're doing.

59:22.655 --> 59:25.825
Who says we're going to ambush
Major Powers right here?

59:25.908 --> 59:27.618
Didn't you hear Lieutenant Ring?

59:27.702 --> 59:31.038
<i>Major Powers wants us to die in a loud,
grotesque, military manner.</i>

59:31.414 --> 59:33.416
I don't give a fuck about Major Powers.

59:33.708 --> 59:36.168
My job is to keep you men alive.
Let's move on.

59:45.470 --> 59:47.973
Coming to the ambush site
over the next hill.

59:48.056 --> 59:49.391
Roger that.

59:49.683 --> 59:52.769
<i>It helps, knowing when and where
you're going to be hit, sir.</i>

59:53.854 --> 59:58.524
<i>Easy. Give them a few more yards,
then we'll nail the coffin shut.</i>

01:00:02.778 --> 01:00:04.447
Chill out. Here they come.

01:00:05.031 --> 01:00:06.699
Hit them now!

01:00:07.617 --> 01:00:08.784
Now!

01:00:19.838 --> 01:00:21.256
Cease fire!

01:00:23.217 --> 01:00:25.636
You're in the wrong ambush site!

01:00:27.221 --> 01:00:28.722
Cease fire!

01:00:33.143 --> 01:00:35.646
They're in the wrong ambush site!

01:00:37.022 --> 01:00:39.608
Recon! Recon!

01:00:47.700 --> 01:00:49.536
- Sergeant Major!
- Yes?

01:00:50.161 --> 01:00:52.163
Turn this damn thing off.

01:00:52.789 --> 01:00:55.458
<i>Makes a hell of a racket, doesn't it, sir?</i>

01:00:59.546 --> 01:01:02.924
<i>This man usurped authority,
disregarded procedures...</i>

01:01:03.007 --> 01:01:07.427
<i>... and ignored my personal directives
all week. Why, Lieutenant?</i>

01:01:07.594 --> 01:01:11.098
<i>- Sir, I thought the training...
- You think too much and act too little.</i>

01:01:11.181 --> 01:01:14.726
You're supposed to be an officer.
Look it up in your leader's handbook.

01:01:16.770 --> 01:01:20.107
Who gave you permission to deviate
from the training schedule?

01:01:20.190 --> 01:01:22.360
<i>I needed to evaluate my men, sir.</i>

01:01:22.610 --> 01:01:27.365
<i>They're not your men, you son of a bitch.
They're the U.S. Marine Corps' men.</i>

01:01:27.448 --> 01:01:30.702
The 2nd Division's men.
The 8th Marine Regiment's men.

01:01:30.785 --> 01:01:33.705
<i>In other words, they're my men.
And so are you. Get it?</i>

01:01:33.872 --> 01:01:38.793
I'll get my ass shot off if I'm in a hot
landing zone with an untrained platoon.

01:01:39.002 --> 01:01:42.171
You will follow my program to the letter.
No questions asked.

01:01:42.255 --> 01:01:45.592
<i>We go into combat tomorrow,
you'll plant half those men.</i>

01:01:50.763 --> 01:01:52.557
<i>You did it on your own, didn't you?</i>

01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:55.644
I can't fix it if I don't know what's broken.

01:01:56.020 --> 01:01:57.813
You make it easy.

01:01:57.897 --> 01:01:58.939
Sir...

01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:02.401
...I gave Gunney permission
to freelance his...

01:02:02.484 --> 01:02:04.820
<i>... I mean, the men, sir.</i>

01:02:09.658 --> 01:02:11.076
<i>Wait outside, Ring.</i>

01:02:11.410 --> 01:02:12.453
<i>Aye, aye, sir.</i>

01:02:16.664 --> 01:02:19.000
<i>I'm going to run you
out of the Corps, Highway.</i>

01:02:19.709 --> 01:02:23.046
<i>The funny thing is, you'll do all the work.</i>

01:02:23.963 --> 01:02:26.090
<i>Sooner or later, you'll disobey orders...</i>

01:02:26.174 --> 01:02:30.094
<i>... circumvent procedures again,
or just get drunk.</i>

01:02:30.512 --> 01:02:31.805
You can't help it.

01:02:32.181 --> 01:02:36.143
<i>You're too old, too stupid and
too prideful to change.</i>

01:02:37.228 --> 01:02:39.230
I'll enjoy watching you fall.

01:02:41.190 --> 01:02:43.692
<i>Get out and send in that idiot, Ring.</i>

01:02:50.824 --> 01:02:52.910
<i>He wants to see you, Lieutenant.</i>

01:02:55.287 --> 01:02:57.623
- I'm sorry.
- No need to be.

01:02:58.791 --> 01:02:59.833
Lieutenant?

01:03:00.751 --> 01:03:02.002
Recon.

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:12.722
You'll let anybody in here. Won't you?

01:03:13.848 --> 01:03:16.184
Have one on the house to ease your pain.

01:03:28.863 --> 01:03:32.366
Want to get drunk and howl at the moon...

01:03:33.409 --> 01:03:36.912
<i>... get us both busted back to low-ass,
no-rank, mud-rolling PFC?</i>

01:03:37.413 --> 01:03:38.747
I'm your man.

01:03:38.998 --> 01:03:40.500
<i>What are we, Chooz?</i>

01:03:41.710 --> 01:03:46.381
We're short-haired bastards with meat
cleavers for pricks and kerosene for blood.

01:03:46.923 --> 01:03:49.259
Yes. We're all of that. That's for sure.

01:03:50.886 --> 01:03:51.970
We're 0-1-1.

01:03:53.263 --> 01:03:54.431
Say again?

01:03:55.557 --> 01:03:59.895
<i>Major Powers, one dark cloudy morning,
said to me, "Sergeant Major...</i>

01:04:00.979 --> 01:04:02.647
"...you're 0-1-1.

01:04:03.106 --> 01:04:06.651
<i>"No wins. One tie, Korea...</i>

01:04:07.277 --> 01:04:09.112
<i>"...and one loss, Vietnam."</i>

01:04:12.032 --> 01:04:15.036
<i>Maybe we lost the war,
but we won the battles.</i>

01:04:17.872 --> 01:04:21.042
I'm not going to lose the next one
because my men aren't ready.

01:04:21.918 --> 01:04:23.377
What are you going to do?

01:04:24.128 --> 01:04:25.796
Make them Marines.

01:04:26.881 --> 01:04:28.382
Stoney Jackson...

01:04:28.758 --> 01:04:33.303
<i>... best goddamned platoon sergeant
two short-pricked, piss-ant...</i>

01:04:33.428 --> 01:04:36.139
<i>... baby soldier, little fuckers
ever went to war with.</i>

01:04:36.473 --> 01:04:38.975
- Yes. Heartbreak Ridge.
- Heartbreak Ridge.

01:04:39.226 --> 01:04:40.894
Your CO called.

01:04:41.561 --> 01:04:43.647
Your battalion just went on full alert.

01:04:55.493 --> 01:04:56.994
God bless.

01:04:58.955 --> 01:05:01.916
- I can't find my tent.
- Where's my poncho liner?

01:05:01.999 --> 01:05:04.460
<i>Damn it, who's got my web gear?</i>

01:05:04.544 --> 01:05:06.712
<i>Profile, that's my canteen.</i>

01:05:07.046 --> 01:05:11.217
Aponte better get back here.
He'll do time for being AWOL.

01:05:12.385 --> 01:05:16.556
<i>People, let's have an equipment check.
Weapon?</i>

01:05:19.433 --> 01:05:20.726
Let's keep it simple.

01:05:20.810 --> 01:05:24.982
<i>You got boots on,
you can walk into combat. Let's go.</i>

01:05:29.278 --> 01:05:30.362
Where's Aponte?

01:05:30.654 --> 01:05:33.657
He's sick. Must've been the chipped beef.
I'm sick myself.

01:05:33.740 --> 01:05:37.077
- You've eaten worse.
- Only when I'm shit-faced.

01:05:46.419 --> 01:05:50.089
These DD-13-48 request forms
are not filled out properly.

01:05:50.673 --> 01:05:54.552
<i>We're going to approach this in an orderly,
proficient manner, Sergeant Major.</i>

01:05:54.635 --> 01:05:55.678
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

01:05:56.971 --> 01:05:59.433
I want you to be sure
that each round of ammo...

01:05:59.516 --> 01:06:03.353
...is counted and returned
in the same way it was received.

01:06:03.645 --> 01:06:08.400
- I'll personally dot the i's and cross the t's.
- Sloppiness breeds inefficiency.

01:06:09.401 --> 01:06:12.404
<i>Your outfit could use
some cleaning up, Gunney.</i>

01:06:13.155 --> 01:06:16.325
<i>Sir, I want to issue my squad leader
some night vision glasses.</i>

01:06:16.700 --> 01:06:20.746
- I should've thought of that.
- That is not part of your TO&E.

01:06:20.996 --> 01:06:22.247
I thought it might...

01:06:22.331 --> 01:06:26.001
Fill out the proper request forms
and send it through the chain of command.

01:06:26.084 --> 01:06:27.336
Request forms?

01:06:32.090 --> 01:06:33.133
Attention!

01:06:36.054 --> 01:06:37.889
<i>At ease, men.</i>

01:06:38.181 --> 01:06:41.809
<i>Major Malcolm Powers, sir.
Annapolis, Class of '71.</i>

01:06:43.061 --> 01:06:44.729
<i>How are your men doing, Major?</i>

01:06:45.313 --> 01:06:48.733
<i>My men are ready to fight to the death
to protect our country, sir.</i>

01:06:50.235 --> 01:06:52.569
Let's hope that won't be necessary.

01:06:55.113 --> 01:06:56.782
Have we ever served together?

01:06:57.366 --> 01:07:00.118
<i>I don't know, sir.
Sergeant Major Choozoo and I...</i>

01:07:00.202 --> 01:07:02.871
<i>... were in the 2nd Battalion
in the 7th in 1968.</i>

01:07:03.580 --> 01:07:06.416
<i>I had a rifle company in 1st Battalion, 7th.</i>

01:07:06.917 --> 01:07:09.921
<i>We sure as hell chewed
some of the same dirt, sir.</i>

01:07:10.463 --> 01:07:14.300
That's for sure.
What's your assessment of this alert?

01:07:14.801 --> 01:07:16.386
It's a cluster fuck.

01:07:19.806 --> 01:07:20.890
Say again?

01:07:20.974 --> 01:07:24.644
<i>Marines are fighting men, sir,
they shouldn't be sitting on their asses...</i>

01:07:24.727 --> 01:07:28.481
...filling out forms for equipment
they should already have.

01:07:29.399 --> 01:07:31.568
<i>Interesting observation, Gunney.</i>

01:07:33.278 --> 01:07:34.404
<i>Carry on, Major.</i>

01:07:40.743 --> 01:07:43.080
<i>Now hear this. Now hear this.</i>

01:07:43.205 --> 01:07:45.291
This is it. We're going to war.

01:07:46.834 --> 01:07:51.088
<i>This has been an emergency deployment
readiness exercise.</i>

01:07:51.755 --> 01:07:55.926
<i>We are standing down.
The alert is cancelled.</i>

01:07:56.510 --> 01:07:57.761
Damn it.

01:07:59.013 --> 01:08:01.014
<i>Maybe next time, sir.</i>

01:08:02.056 --> 01:08:04.058
You heard him. Move it out.

01:08:13.276 --> 01:08:14.527
Aponte.

01:08:15.403 --> 01:08:16.738
<i>Oh, him.</i>

01:08:17.071 --> 01:08:18.407
Where is he?

01:08:18.991 --> 01:08:20.658
What's wrong with you?

01:08:21.076 --> 01:08:23.453
Nobody goes over the hill on me.

01:08:24.287 --> 01:08:28.459
<i>If you didn't have those stripes,
I'd kick your ass around the block!</i>

01:08:28.667 --> 01:08:30.794
<i>Yes, but since I'm not into violence...</i>

01:08:30.877 --> 01:08:34.381
...I'll refrain from kicking your ass
at this particular time.

01:08:34.506 --> 01:08:36.508
I'll give you a rebate on your life.

01:08:37.176 --> 01:08:39.511
<i>Besides, who the hell is Aponte?</i>

01:08:39.636 --> 01:08:42.640
He ain't heavy
and he sure the hell ain't my brother.

01:08:44.058 --> 01:08:45.100
Gunney Highway.

01:08:45.517 --> 01:08:47.519
That's right. Gunney Highway.

01:08:47.937 --> 01:08:49.188
Come in.

01:08:49.647 --> 01:08:52.107
<i>I'm sorry, but I had to tell him.</i>

01:08:52.191 --> 01:08:55.319
<i>This is my wife, Sara.
Clean that up a little, honey.</i>

01:08:55.569 --> 01:08:58.240
<i>Gunney, I filled out all the forms there are.</i>

01:08:58.657 --> 01:09:01.618
What the Corps could give
just isn't enough for the family.

01:09:01.993 --> 01:09:03.118
So I took a job.

01:09:03.203 --> 01:09:05.247
- You got a job?
- Yes.

01:09:05.622 --> 01:09:08.707
- You want out of the Marines?
- No! No way.

01:09:09.209 --> 01:09:12.795
<i>Then we're going to have to cut through
all the red tape B.S., aren't we?</i>

01:09:12.877 --> 01:09:14.462
<i>- Yes, we are.
- Knock it off.</i>

01:09:16.756 --> 01:09:19.593
Here. Here's a special fund.
Gunnery sergeants only.

01:09:23.013 --> 01:09:25.015
<i>Don't worry, you can pay it back.</i>

01:09:25.724 --> 01:09:28.937
- Here. You better take him. Jesus Christ.
- Thank you.

01:09:37.487 --> 01:09:40.907
- What are you smiling at?
- I always knew you were Santa Claus.

01:09:40.991 --> 01:09:43.910
You pull another suckhead play like that...

01:09:43.993 --> 01:09:47.247
...the only thing that will beat you
to the brig is an ambulance.

01:09:47.330 --> 01:09:49.582
<i>Yes, sir, Gunnery Sergeant Highway, sir.</i>

01:09:54.254 --> 01:09:56.590
You can't leave the Duke of Cool!

01:09:56.882 --> 01:09:58.717
This man has no social graces.

01:10:03.806 --> 01:10:04.974
So?

01:10:06.017 --> 01:10:08.686
Lureen down at the Palace
said you had the night off.

01:10:09.395 --> 01:10:11.063
Lureen talks too much.

01:10:11.564 --> 01:10:13.232
Can I buy you a beer?

01:10:16.777 --> 01:10:18.112
Jesus.

01:10:20.447 --> 01:10:24.784
<i>You can't come back after all this time,
with no warning whatsoever.</i>

01:10:25.118 --> 01:10:28.455
<i>Interfere at my place of work,
almost started a brawl...</i>

01:10:28.788 --> 01:10:31.625
...almost lost me the only crummy job
I could find.

01:10:31.958 --> 01:10:35.212
<i>Then you show up here,
expecting me to just smooth as silk...</i>

01:10:35.295 --> 01:10:37.632
...invite you in for a sit-down and a smile.

01:10:37.965 --> 01:10:40.801
<i>It's always the same, Highway.
All balls, no brains.</i>

01:10:42.470 --> 01:10:44.305
Is there something you're afraid of?

01:10:44.639 --> 01:10:48.768
Yes. I'm afraid I'll dent that
thick skull of yours with this frying pan.

01:10:51.479 --> 01:10:55.858
<i>- It wouldn't be the first time, would it?
- No.</i>

01:10:59.487 --> 01:11:01.155
Nice place you have here.

01:11:03.032 --> 01:11:05.576
Thanks. You want a glass?

01:11:17.172 --> 01:11:21.593
- Feet still bothersome?
- I hawk booze five nights a week.

01:11:22.928 --> 01:11:25.931
There's no senior prom
looming on my horizon.

01:11:27.182 --> 01:11:28.849
To the old times.

01:11:29.350 --> 01:11:31.686
Just as long as you don't say good times.

01:11:32.019 --> 01:11:34.188
<i>We had our share of those, too, didn't we?</i>

01:11:34.939 --> 01:11:37.191
I don't know. I can't think that far back.

01:11:38.276 --> 01:11:39.860
How are you feeling?

01:11:40.278 --> 01:11:41.612
Terrific.

01:11:41.862 --> 01:11:43.864
Absolutely couldn't feel better.

01:11:48.370 --> 01:11:50.038
What brings you here?

01:11:51.206 --> 01:11:54.042
<i>I'm back with Recon, back where I belong.</i>

01:11:56.879 --> 01:11:58.088
So?

01:11:58.380 --> 01:12:00.382
It's different this time.

01:12:02.551 --> 01:12:03.635
How?

01:12:04.887 --> 01:12:09.057
I'm coming to the end of it.
I don't know where I go from here.

01:12:09.308 --> 01:12:12.978
I just want it to end
as right as it was when I started.

01:12:16.565 --> 01:12:20.068
Do you want some chips? There's pretzels.

01:12:21.738 --> 01:12:22.780
<i>Yes, thanks.</i>

01:12:23.740 --> 01:12:25.742
Fringe benefits of work.

01:12:26.576 --> 01:12:28.077
Tell me something.

01:12:29.078 --> 01:12:32.081
Did we mutually nurture each other?

01:12:33.583 --> 01:12:35.001
I beg your pardon?

01:12:35.418 --> 01:12:38.629
Did we communicate in a meaningful way
in our relationship?

01:12:39.588 --> 01:12:41.423
Relationship?

01:12:45.260 --> 01:12:47.429
<i>Hell, I thought we were married.</i>

01:12:49.097 --> 01:12:51.767
I've been thinking about the past lately.

01:12:53.936 --> 01:12:56.105
I was just wondering what went wrong.

01:12:57.106 --> 01:12:58.441
With what?

01:12:59.943 --> 01:13:01.277
With me.

01:13:02.111 --> 01:13:03.947
The Corps. With us.

01:13:08.785 --> 01:13:10.954
That is so damn much like you.

01:13:11.162 --> 01:13:16.000
You never could see that things just don't
fit neatly into right and wrong.

01:13:16.793 --> 01:13:18.211
What else is there?

01:13:20.296 --> 01:13:21.965
It isn't that simple.

01:13:25.635 --> 01:13:28.805
I went by those rooms that we rented
when we got married.

01:13:29.138 --> 01:13:30.808
<i>Damn, they're small.</i>

01:13:33.310 --> 01:13:36.146
They say everything shrinks with age.

01:13:40.150 --> 01:13:41.652
Tell me something.

01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:45.656
What did you want out of our marriage?

01:13:48.992 --> 01:13:52.161
We talked once about an avocado ranch...

01:13:52.412 --> 01:13:55.081
...about buying a house
with a barbecue in the back.

01:13:55.498 --> 01:14:00.003
But then you'd volunteer for every damn
war that came down the pike.

01:14:04.507 --> 01:14:06.176
- Goddamn it!
- What's the matter?

01:14:06.677 --> 01:14:08.679
How could I be so stupid?

01:14:09.096 --> 01:14:10.598
What do you mean?

01:14:10.848 --> 01:14:15.227
- You changed tactics on me!
- What are you talking about?

01:14:15.311 --> 01:14:17.980
<i>Gave up the old frontal assault,
tried to outflank me.</i>

01:14:18.063 --> 01:14:21.233
<i>I am onto you, Highway,
and I want you out of here, right now!</i>

01:14:21.525 --> 01:14:25.446
You're not acting very dignified
for a mature woman.

01:14:27.197 --> 01:14:32.036
<i>You old fucking Marine warhorse,
I'll show you dignified!</i>

01:14:32.453 --> 01:14:36.624
You get out of here! Go on!
Get the fuck out of here!

01:14:37.875 --> 01:14:40.754
You better get your tail out of here
or I'll get mad!

01:14:40.837 --> 01:14:42.881
<i>Take that, you old fuck!</i>

01:14:43.215 --> 01:14:47.385
<i>I never want to see your craggy,
old face again, you hear?</i>

01:14:47.719 --> 01:14:50.889
Don't ever come back. Ever!

01:14:52.557 --> 01:14:55.560
<i>She's as crazy as she's always been,
for Christ's sake.</i>

01:14:57.228 --> 01:14:58.896
You asshole!

01:15:04.235 --> 01:15:06.403
<i>I hate you, Highway!</i>

01:15:08.656 --> 01:15:09.865
Fuck you!

01:15:23.171 --> 01:15:24.422
<i>Tonight's winner...</i>

01:15:25.590 --> 01:15:27.842
<i>... is Miss Sarita Dwayne!</i>

01:15:31.221 --> 01:15:33.848
<i>Wait a minute, man. That's bullshit.</i>

01:15:33.932 --> 01:15:35.600
You're trying to rip me off.

01:15:35.934 --> 01:15:37.352
Nobody likes a sore loser.

01:15:37.602 --> 01:15:40.772
I'm an equal opportunity ass-kicker.
Let's vote.

01:15:40.855 --> 01:15:42.691
You people have a right to vote.

01:15:42.774 --> 01:15:45.277
<i>Whoever voted for Miss Banana Titties,
say, "Yes."</i>

01:15:46.152 --> 01:15:47.487
No!

01:15:48.029 --> 01:15:50.700
<i>All who voted for me,
say, "Rock the house."</i>

01:15:50.783 --> 01:15:53.619
Rock the house!

01:15:58.958 --> 01:16:01.210
No man. You all the faggot Mod Squad?

01:16:01.627 --> 01:16:05.131
I don't play none of this jail
give-up-the-booty bullshit.

01:16:11.303 --> 01:16:13.221
Don't ask for my autograph.

01:16:16.808 --> 01:16:19.144
You can rob me...

01:16:20.145 --> 01:16:23.523
<i>... you can starve me, you can beat me,
and you can kill me...</i>

01:16:24.817 --> 01:16:26.819
...just don't bore me.

01:16:33.743 --> 01:16:36.579
- I'm really glad I could help.
- I owe you another dinner.

01:16:46.839 --> 01:16:51.010
Powers will thin-slice your prick
if he finds out about this!

01:16:51.260 --> 01:16:52.929
- Sergeant Major!
- Who are you?

01:16:53.304 --> 01:16:55.431
<i>Jones, 2nd Battalion. Recon Platoon.</i>

01:16:57.808 --> 01:17:00.562
<i>Highway's platoon?
Snap to, Marine. Give me a hand.</i>

01:17:00.646 --> 01:17:03.357
Highway knows I'm innocent.
We're like brothers.

01:17:03.857 --> 01:17:05.525
I posted his bail.

01:17:05.859 --> 01:17:08.153
<i>- He needs you, Aggie.
- Until the next war.</i>

01:17:09.196 --> 01:17:10.739
Good thing we got him out.

01:17:11.949 --> 01:17:13.283
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

01:17:14.201 --> 01:17:15.369
Coffee.

01:17:20.039 --> 01:17:22.875
I always wanted to check this place out.

01:17:23.709 --> 01:17:25.336
Look at all this history.

01:17:25.419 --> 01:17:27.755
Little Mary's served Marines
from three wars.

01:17:29.882 --> 01:17:31.217
How is he doing?

01:17:31.717 --> 01:17:34.888
<i>Aggie will put him back together again,
just like she always has.</i>

01:17:38.225 --> 01:17:41.728
<i>Highway's something else.
High-speed, low drag.</i>

01:17:41.979 --> 01:17:44.648
No one better to be with
if you're in a hot LZ.

01:17:45.315 --> 01:17:46.900
Heartbreak Ridge.

01:17:47.568 --> 01:17:48.652
It was the truth.

01:17:50.404 --> 01:17:51.905
What's Heartbreak Ridge?

01:17:53.740 --> 01:17:57.411
<i>Listen, we have to understand each other...</i>

01:17:58.245 --> 01:17:59.913
...before we go any further.

01:18:00.747 --> 01:18:02.583
Are we going any further?

01:18:03.417 --> 01:18:05.586
You'll be out of the Corps soon.

01:18:05.919 --> 01:18:09.924
<i>But you are gung-ho, through and through.
Always will be.</i>

01:18:10.258 --> 01:18:14.095
And there is no room in my future
for a Marine.

01:18:15.430 --> 01:18:17.932
I'm not sure I like how you say "Marine."

01:18:19.601 --> 01:18:22.937
I can say "Marine" any damn way I choose.

01:18:23.396 --> 01:18:25.397
I earned that right.

01:18:27.774 --> 01:18:30.944
<i>- That's right, you did.
- I lived in a rathole...</i>

01:18:31.028 --> 01:18:35.365
<i>... when they were bringing those boys
home in those flag-draped, metal coffins.</i>

01:18:35.449 --> 01:18:38.744
I don't think I got a wink's sleep in 1968.

01:18:39.036 --> 01:18:42.414
- Do you remember that year?
- Yes. I remember.

01:18:43.458 --> 01:18:48.087
<i>I'd turn on the TV in the morning,
I'd eat dinner in front of it every night...</i>

01:18:48.171 --> 01:18:51.925
<i>... eyes glued, hoping to catch
a glimpse of you on the news...</i>

01:18:52.008 --> 01:18:53.843
...and then praying I wouldn't.

01:18:55.303 --> 01:18:57.722
Then I'd crawl into bed and wonder...

01:18:57.805 --> 01:19:02.560
...where were you? What were you doing?
Were you alive?

01:19:03.144 --> 01:19:05.271
And I had no way of knowing.

01:19:09.984 --> 01:19:14.822
I guess there are things that work
harder on a woman than being shot at.

01:19:16.574 --> 01:19:20.120
I swear the not knowing was the worst.

01:19:26.418 --> 01:19:27.836
I'm sorry.

01:19:37.512 --> 01:19:39.347
<i>That's all right, baby.</i>

01:19:44.018 --> 01:19:45.603
That's all right.

01:19:51.109 --> 01:19:54.196
We went up and down that dirt pile
for six days and six nights.

01:19:54.280 --> 01:19:58.033
<i>Fixed bayonets, hand-to-hand.
Fought them something fierce.</i>

01:19:58.117 --> 01:20:01.036
They gave back as good as they got.
Lots of men died.

01:20:01.495 --> 01:20:03.372
We were the 23rd Infantry.

01:20:03.873 --> 01:20:05.499
We joined the Corps later.

01:20:06.083 --> 01:20:07.877
We were younger than you are.

01:20:09.253 --> 01:20:11.714
I never heard of any Heartbreak Ridge.

01:20:12.923 --> 01:20:16.093
It's not in any of the history books.
It's a little piece of war.

01:20:16.510 --> 01:20:18.804
<i>The place didn't have a name,
just a number.</i>

01:20:19.096 --> 01:20:21.765
<i>Stoney Jackson looked at it
and said, "Ladies...</i>

01:20:22.683 --> 01:20:25.352
<i>"...if this don't kill us, it'll break our hearts."</i>

01:20:25.603 --> 01:20:28.064
- Who's Stoney Jackson?
- Little Mary's husband.

01:20:29.107 --> 01:20:30.984
He was our platoon sergeant.

01:20:31.109 --> 01:20:34.112
He recommended Highway
for his Congressional Medal of Honor.

01:20:35.780 --> 01:20:38.074
Gunney Highway won the CMH?

01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:42.037
He charged two machine gun nests
by himself.

01:20:42.787 --> 01:20:44.246
He didn't sleep for three days.

01:20:44.371 --> 01:20:47.208
The final human wave he held off
almost single-handedly.

01:20:48.375 --> 01:20:49.668
When it was over...

01:20:50.669 --> 01:20:53.130
<i>... there was me, Stoney Jackson...</i>

01:20:54.006 --> 01:20:55.341
...and Tom Highway.

01:20:55.966 --> 01:20:57.927
We were the only ones still alive.

01:20:59.345 --> 01:21:01.388
What happened to Jackson?

01:21:01.848 --> 01:21:03.975
He was killed at Khe Sahn in 1968.

01:21:04.142 --> 01:21:07.145
Can I get you something to eat?
I can fix it in no time.

01:21:09.856 --> 01:21:11.316
<i>No, thank you, ma'am.</i>

01:21:14.986 --> 01:21:17.906
<i>Excuse me, ma'am.
You don't happen to be up...</i>

01:21:18.031 --> 01:21:20.700
<i>... when Gunney Highway
leaves for the base, do you?</i>

01:21:20.784 --> 01:21:23.078
I pour his coffee and lay out his things.

01:21:45.935 --> 01:21:47.311
<i>Platoon, attention!</i>

01:21:50.022 --> 01:21:51.023
Right face!

01:21:52.358 --> 01:21:53.526
Forward march!

01:22:04.536 --> 01:22:06.997
Each platoon will proceed
to the objective...

01:22:07.122 --> 01:22:09.583
...which in this case
is the Battalion Bear Pit.

01:22:10.125 --> 01:22:13.045
<i>Whoever reaches it first
will get a 72- hour liberty.</i>

01:22:13.921 --> 01:22:17.008
<i>Sir, it would be an honor,
if you would accompany my platoon.</i>

01:22:18.926 --> 01:22:20.636
<i>Thank you, Staff Sergeant.</i>

01:22:26.934 --> 01:22:28.561
Get out of your seats.

01:22:52.419 --> 01:22:55.088
<i>Johanson, tighten up that harness.</i>

01:22:55.339 --> 01:22:59.176
<i>- Gunney, I'm afraid of heights.
- So am I.</i>

01:22:59.426 --> 01:23:00.427
You are?

01:23:00.761 --> 01:23:03.930
Jumping out of a perfectly good airplane
is not a natural act...

01:23:04.055 --> 01:23:06.724
...so let's do it right and enjoy the view.

01:23:51.979 --> 01:23:53.355
Let's move.

01:23:54.481 --> 01:23:57.402
We made it. We're the first platoon
to reach the Bear Pit.

01:23:57.819 --> 01:23:59.445
<i>Not so quick, sir.</i>

01:24:02.323 --> 01:24:04.617
Darn. 1st Platoon.

01:24:05.577 --> 01:24:06.786
Major. It's Highway.

01:24:08.329 --> 01:24:09.497
Damn.

01:24:09.747 --> 01:24:12.041
<i>Come on, let's smoke 'em.</i>

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:14.960
<i>1st Platoon, follow me!</i>

01:24:37.734 --> 01:24:39.277
Recon wins.

01:24:40.194 --> 01:24:44.324
<i>Gunney, you don't know your place.
1st Platoon is the victor!</i>

01:24:45.283 --> 01:24:47.243
<i>I say we have ourselves a dilemma, sir.</i>

01:24:48.453 --> 01:24:52.665
<i>Sergeant Major, as my umpire, I order you
to declare 1st Platoon the winner.</i>

01:24:53.583 --> 01:24:55.793
<i>Sir, that wouldn't be fair.</i>

01:24:56.544 --> 01:24:59.380
What do you propose to resolve
this situation?

01:24:59.631 --> 01:25:00.798
Match-up.

01:25:02.550 --> 01:25:04.093
<i>Okay, men, get them off.</i>

01:25:05.387 --> 01:25:07.181
Get your shit off.

01:25:44.510 --> 01:25:46.387
Get them out!

01:25:51.767 --> 01:25:53.561
Get them out!

01:26:29.973 --> 01:26:31.432
Recon!

01:26:35.978 --> 01:26:37.771
<i>Sergeant Major, 1st Platoon wins.</i>

01:26:39.857 --> 01:26:41.567
<i>I don't see it that way, Major.</i>

01:26:41.692 --> 01:26:44.778
<i>You're out of order, Gunney.
1st Platoon is king of the pit.</i>

01:26:44.904 --> 01:26:47.448
- How do you figure?
- Your man cheated.

01:26:47.573 --> 01:26:48.825
<i>I say, he improvised.</i>

01:26:48.992 --> 01:26:49.993
He cheated!

01:26:50.243 --> 01:26:51.703
He adapted. He overcame.

01:26:53.246 --> 01:26:55.123
There's only one way to settle this.

01:26:55.707 --> 01:26:58.210
<i>Platoon sergeants, front and center.</i>

01:27:00.253 --> 01:27:03.089
<i>Remember, Sergeant,
I'm leading your platoon today.</i>

01:27:04.507 --> 01:27:07.510
<i>Old man, it's time somebody
put you in your place.</i>

01:28:22.628 --> 01:28:25.882
It felt great beating
Major Powers' elite fighting unit!

01:28:27.717 --> 01:28:30.261
I've been bitten by every bug
known to mankind.

01:28:30.344 --> 01:28:33.015
<i>With all these bumps,
you look like you got muscles.</i>

01:28:34.349 --> 01:28:35.893
I bet I have poison ivy.

01:28:36.018 --> 01:28:39.271
You can get permanent light duty
for all of the crud on your body.

01:28:39.938 --> 01:28:43.942
Your dream come true. You won't
have to do this bullshit any more.

01:28:44.109 --> 01:28:46.236
Fuck you. I'm getting pretty good at this.

01:28:48.405 --> 01:28:50.615
<i>This man must be sick,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

01:28:51.115 --> 01:28:52.575
I'll tell you who's sick...

01:28:52.700 --> 01:28:57.413
...Gunney Highway is the sickest
individual I've ever come across.

01:28:57.496 --> 01:29:01.000
That's right! Order today and get
this record set from Recon Records...

01:29:01.125 --> 01:29:03.753
<i>... with songs like,
Highway's a Sick Individual...</i>

01:29:04.462 --> 01:29:06.589
<i>... Polish My Weapon and I'll Polish Yours.</i>

01:29:06.714 --> 01:29:08.508
That's my song! I like that one!

01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:10.928
<i>Bionic Marine.</i>

01:29:11.970 --> 01:29:14.431
<i>- That's it! Bionic Marine.
- Yes, do that one!</i>

01:29:14.640 --> 01:29:18.852
<i>"We kicked a lot of ass,
at a place called Heartbreak Ridge</i>

01:29:18.977 --> 01:29:23.106
<i>"Don't fuck with Scarface Highway,
baddest jarhead there is</i>

01:29:23.899 --> 01:29:27.152
<i>"He's a bad, psycho mother, bionic Marine</i>

01:29:27.611 --> 01:29:31.281
<i>"A leatherneck lifer,
who likes the barracks clean</i>

01:29:31.823 --> 01:29:34.910
- "He kicked Powers in the ass
- "Whipped him upside the head

01:29:35.035 --> 01:29:38.872
<i>"If you fuck with this sick mother,
then you are going to end up dead</i>

01:29:39.539 --> 01:29:42.376
<i>"He's a fire-pissing jarhead, bionic Marine</i>

01:29:42.794 --> 01:29:46.381
"Salty dog doesn't wear anything
but Marine Corps green

01:29:46.464 --> 01:29:49.968
- "No time to shit or shower
- "No time to smoke a cig

01:29:50.051 --> 01:29:55.390
<i>"Don't fuck with Gunney Highway,
or you'll end up in the brig"</i>

01:29:58.977 --> 01:30:00.686
I'll tell you something else.

01:30:00.769 --> 01:30:04.106
Highway won the Congressional
Medal of Honor at Heartbreak Ridge.

01:30:04.231 --> 01:30:05.774
- Check that out.
- The CMH!

01:30:05.899 --> 01:30:08.402
<i>I knew he was bad, but not that bad.</i>

01:30:09.528 --> 01:30:12.364
Major Powers wants statements
from each and every of you.

01:30:14.116 --> 01:30:15.909
What kind of statement?

01:30:16.201 --> 01:30:18.871
Gunnery Sergeant Highway
used live ammunition...

01:30:19.414 --> 01:30:22.584
...with unauthorized weapons
in the training exercise.

01:30:24.377 --> 01:30:25.837
Says who?

01:30:26.421 --> 01:30:28.548
I thought you guys didn't like Highway.

01:30:29.799 --> 01:30:32.635
<i>I heard that AK-47 fire
coming from your AO.</i>

01:30:34.596 --> 01:30:36.973
Don't you want to go back
to the way it was?

01:30:37.765 --> 01:30:39.893
Nobody fucking with you?

01:30:42.395 --> 01:30:46.149
Seems to me that no one is going
to fuck with us the way things are now.

01:30:46.900 --> 01:30:49.736
There's weekend liberty in it for all of you.

01:30:50.236 --> 01:30:51.864
I'll start with you.

01:30:53.157 --> 01:30:54.783
I got nothing to say.

01:30:55.951 --> 01:30:58.078
<i>- You?
- No hablo ingles.</i>

01:30:59.204 --> 01:31:03.042
This can go hard on you all
if you aren't going to cooperate.

01:31:06.170 --> 01:31:08.464
<i>We don't have anything
to say to you, Webster.</i>

01:31:10.298 --> 01:31:14.135
Why don't you take your ass back
to that 1st Platoon of yours...

01:31:14.344 --> 01:31:17.764
...and don't go away mad. Just go away.

01:31:18.681 --> 01:31:20.308
You've been told.

01:31:35.783 --> 01:31:38.410
- I hate social functions.
- You're going to love it.

01:31:38.994 --> 01:31:42.164
Your presence is requested
at the MAU Commander's open house.

01:31:42.289 --> 01:31:44.416
- Full military dress.
- Piss on that.

01:31:45.042 --> 01:31:47.503
<i>You'll be there,
Gunnery Sergeant Thomas Highway.</i>

01:31:47.962 --> 01:31:50.631
<i>Stand tall, look sharp,
and wear all your ribbons...</i>

01:31:50.714 --> 01:31:53.384
...so these people can see
a hero who isn't dead.

01:31:53.842 --> 01:31:55.636
- Let's find the bar.
- Good idea.

01:31:58.347 --> 01:32:00.641
How are you this evening? Thank you.

01:32:02.519 --> 01:32:04.980
I'm privileged to greet
a Medal of Honor winner.

01:32:05.480 --> 01:32:06.481
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

01:32:07.857 --> 01:32:10.235
Run into any cluster fucks lately?

01:32:12.445 --> 01:32:14.239
<i>No. Not lately, sir.</i>

01:32:14.406 --> 01:32:16.783
Thanks for stopping by. Enjoy the party.

01:32:19.994 --> 01:32:24.456
I love to see the brass snap to attention
when they see that little ribbon.

01:32:24.582 --> 01:32:27.835
<i>What do you do at a party like this,
stick out your little pinkie?</i>

01:32:27.918 --> 01:32:30.754
Just don't unzip and stick Old Blue out.

01:32:31.130 --> 01:32:34.300
Didn't J.J. Johnson do that at
a WAVE party in San Diego?

01:32:34.425 --> 01:32:38.555
No! That was me. J.J. Mooned
the ARVN General at China Beach.

01:32:40.515 --> 01:32:44.728
Let's drink a toast to J.J. And
all of the pieces of him we couldn't find.

01:32:44.853 --> 01:32:46.313
Funniest guy I ever met.

01:32:47.814 --> 01:32:51.318
<i>One thing about a party like this,
the conversation is so adult.</i>

01:32:55.113 --> 01:32:58.366
<i>Choozoo, I think I'm going to head
for the back door of this place.</i>

01:32:58.491 --> 01:32:59.951
And lose all this joy?

01:33:01.286 --> 01:33:03.496
<i>You won't be upset if I cut in, will you?</i>

01:33:03.622 --> 01:33:04.789
I'll get over it.

01:33:05.373 --> 01:33:07.250
I'll go see what the chow's like.

01:33:08.210 --> 01:33:09.920
Would you like to dance?

01:33:12.215 --> 01:33:15.134
- What are you doing here?
- I'm still on the mailing list.

01:33:16.552 --> 01:33:17.553
- Yes?
- Yes.

01:33:41.910 --> 01:33:43.370
What's so funny?

01:33:44.162 --> 01:33:47.667
<i>I was just thinking,
this reminds me of the Senior Prom...</i>

01:33:47.750 --> 01:33:49.794
...and the chaperone with the ruler.

01:33:49.919 --> 01:33:53.506
<i>"Now, Agnes Ann, you remember,
you keep eight inches of daylight...</i>

01:33:53.631 --> 01:33:56.384
"...between you and that young man
you're dancing with."

01:33:56.884 --> 01:33:58.594
Yes. I do remember that.

01:33:59.178 --> 01:34:02.682
Wasn't that the first night we ever...

01:34:03.224 --> 01:34:05.518
<i>Yes. Yes, it was.</i>

01:34:06.060 --> 01:34:09.397
<i>Agnes Ann,
you were a wild creature, I must say.</i>

01:34:11.941 --> 01:34:13.985
What do your magazines say about that?

01:34:14.694 --> 01:34:17.154
I don't know.
I haven't gotten to that part yet.

01:34:17.238 --> 01:34:18.698
Are you still reading them?

01:34:18.906 --> 01:34:20.074
Affirmative.

01:34:20.284 --> 01:34:22.244
What do they say about ex-wives?

01:34:24.454 --> 01:34:27.958
Not too much.
Just that sex is great because...

01:34:28.041 --> 01:34:31.879
...you don't have to establish
a relationship or be meaningful.

01:34:34.882 --> 01:34:39.260
<i>- You really are trying to understand us.
- The best I can, yes.</i>

01:34:39.802 --> 01:34:43.723
Is that because you can't be a Marine
anymore and you have no place to go?

01:34:45.224 --> 01:34:47.268
I shouldn't have said that. I'm sorry.

01:34:48.477 --> 01:34:49.687
That's all right.

01:34:49.854 --> 01:34:52.148
We've known each other too long...

01:34:52.231 --> 01:34:55.986
...to run away just over a little thing
like tearing each other's guts out.

01:34:56.194 --> 01:34:58.739
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that.

01:35:00.324 --> 01:35:02.618
It never seems to work out
between you and me.

01:35:05.579 --> 01:35:07.372
- With her husband.
- I see.

01:35:07.998 --> 01:35:11.168
- I'm having a great time.
- It's a whole family gathering.

01:35:12.836 --> 01:35:17.299
I've been thinking about
that avocado ranch we talked about.

01:35:17.424 --> 01:35:19.718
<i>Tom, Roy has asked me to marry him.</i>

01:35:21.094 --> 01:35:22.471
What'd you say?

01:35:26.058 --> 01:35:27.226
<i>Attention, please!</i>

01:35:28.727 --> 01:35:32.398
<i>The 22nd Marine Amphibious Unit's alert
status has been upgraded.</i>

01:35:33.066 --> 01:35:37.362
<i>All officers and staff NCOs
will return immediately to their units.</i>

01:35:37.779 --> 01:35:38.780
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:36:26.369 --> 01:36:28.496
<i>This is another bullshit alert, right?</i>

01:36:28.997 --> 01:36:30.290
<i>We're going to war, men.</i>

01:36:32.792 --> 01:36:37.589
We're going to assist with the rescue of
American citizens on the island of Grenada.

01:36:38.423 --> 01:36:39.633
The island of what?

01:36:39.758 --> 01:36:43.095
Grenada. It's a Caribbean island
also known as "the Isle of Spice."

01:36:43.220 --> 01:36:45.723
It's 86 nautical miles from Venezuela.

01:36:45.848 --> 01:36:49.184
Our mission is to helo-cast
into a small bay...

01:36:49.268 --> 01:36:51.562
...and recon before
the Marine landing force.

01:36:51.645 --> 01:36:54.481
<i>No, I can't do that. I forgot my suntan oil.</i>

01:36:55.274 --> 01:36:57.400
It's time to earn your pay. Let's move.

01:36:57.817 --> 01:36:59.152
Pick it up. Let's go.

01:37:10.663 --> 01:37:15.294
<i>Now hear this! Now hear this!
Flight deck, prepare to launch helo.</i>

01:39:09.493 --> 01:39:10.953
Your glasses.

01:39:11.913 --> 01:39:13.080
Get ready.

01:39:46.864 --> 01:39:48.407
<i>Choozoo, do you read me?</i>

01:39:50.409 --> 01:39:52.995
<i>Choozoo, this is Highway.
Do you read me?</i>

01:39:53.162 --> 01:39:56.249
Battalion wants your platoon to recon
toward the university.

01:39:56.415 --> 01:39:58.042
You stay low around Powers.

01:40:01.963 --> 01:40:03.923
See you when it's over.

01:40:29.907 --> 01:40:31.534
Spread out.

01:40:35.705 --> 01:40:36.956
What was that?

01:40:37.582 --> 01:40:42.296
<i>An AK-47. It has a distinctive sound.
Proceed swiftly and with caution, brothers.</i>

01:40:42.462 --> 01:40:45.632
- Get that 60 going around the corner.
- All right.

01:40:59.688 --> 01:41:01.148
Cover my ass.

01:41:15.537 --> 01:41:16.788
<i>Highway's crazy, man.</i>

01:41:41.396 --> 01:41:43.106
<i>They've pulled out, Lieutenant.</i>

01:41:43.649 --> 01:41:45.025
<i>All right, Aponte.</i>

01:41:45.859 --> 01:41:47.194
Slowly.

01:42:25.108 --> 01:42:26.402
Cubans.

01:42:27.653 --> 01:42:29.780
Three-man recon team.

01:42:30.781 --> 01:42:33.951
We better spread out.
I'm sure they've got buddies around here.

01:42:34.868 --> 01:42:36.161
Let's go.

01:42:37.079 --> 01:42:39.373
Spread the fuck out. Let's go.

01:43:10.237 --> 01:43:11.405
Go ahead.

01:43:17.912 --> 01:43:19.079
Go ahead.

01:43:29.381 --> 01:43:33.302
We forgot the beer and the hotdogs.
I'll go back to New York and get them.

01:43:33.427 --> 01:43:38.141
<i>- You run engines as good as your mouth?
- Jones is the name, hot wire is the game.</i>

01:43:38.225 --> 01:43:40.185
<i>Fragetti, go with him.</i>

01:43:48.318 --> 01:43:50.111
- You set? Let's go.
- Let's do it.

01:43:50.528 --> 01:43:52.572
<i>Swede, get up there with that M-60.</i>

01:44:16.721 --> 01:44:17.722
Yes!

01:44:31.903 --> 01:44:34.656
Here comes
the Ayatollah of Rock-and-Roll-a.

01:44:39.327 --> 01:44:41.871
<i>You stay right there, sucker.</i>

01:45:23.205 --> 01:45:24.582
Stay low.

01:46:12.880 --> 01:46:14.340
Jesus.

01:46:15.341 --> 01:46:16.801
Please forgive me.

01:46:22.932 --> 01:46:24.392
Let's go.

01:46:44.746 --> 01:46:47.916
<i>Get in there. Tell them who you are,
so no friendlies get hurt.</i>

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:51.253
<i>Hello, happening hostages.
I'm Stitch Jones, Mr. Funkadelic.</i>

01:46:51.336 --> 01:46:52.963
<i>Try "U.S. Marine," shithead.</i>

01:47:17.155 --> 01:47:18.364
All clear.

01:47:34.504 --> 01:47:35.964
United States Marines!

01:47:49.938 --> 01:47:51.314
You've improved.

01:47:52.440 --> 01:47:53.983
Goddamn it. Gunney!

01:48:09.707 --> 01:48:11.668
<i>U.S. Marines, ma'am.</i>

01:48:19.093 --> 01:48:21.554
- U.S. Marines!
- Is everybody all right?

01:48:29.061 --> 01:48:32.897
<i>You know what they say about college,
a behind is a terrible thing to waste.</i>

01:48:32.981 --> 01:48:37.110
Delta Company said they will give us
surfboards and let us go to the beach.

01:48:37.235 --> 01:48:40.572
One student kissed me four times.
I think I'm in love.

01:48:40.738 --> 01:48:43.741
<i>- Was he good-looking, Profile?
- It was a girl, Gunney.</i>

01:48:43.825 --> 01:48:45.952
Clean your weapons. Check your ammo.

01:48:48.079 --> 01:48:51.083
<i>All secured, sir.
No casualties, no sign of enemy.</i>

01:48:51.166 --> 01:48:54.587
Very good. I want to get some pictures
before we wrap this mission.

01:48:54.878 --> 01:48:57.798
<i>We've encountered some heavy resistance
along the way, sir.</i>

01:48:57.965 --> 01:49:00.259
- Probably local fanatics.
- Negative.

01:49:00.342 --> 01:49:02.386
Cuban regulars with Russian rifles.

01:49:02.636 --> 01:49:05.180
That data has already been factored in.

01:49:05.306 --> 01:49:07.766
- Sergeant? It's Battalion.
- Go ahead.

01:49:09.143 --> 01:49:13.147
<i>Big Daddy says, "Get off your ass
and get back in the war." His words, sir.</i>

01:49:14.523 --> 01:49:16.400
He says he wants to recon that hill.

01:49:16.692 --> 01:49:19.069
He says one of our fly-fly boys
saw some armor.

01:49:19.153 --> 01:49:21.113
You're full of all kinds of good news.

01:49:21.405 --> 01:49:23.116
You're too ugly to live forever.

01:49:24.117 --> 01:49:25.577
<i>Gunney, recon that hill.</i>

01:49:25.702 --> 01:49:30.248
Wait for Foxtrot Company before
launching any assault. Stay in contact.

01:49:30.832 --> 01:49:34.502
<i>Shall I send back data, sir,
or is that already factored in?</i>

01:49:35.128 --> 01:49:36.588
Move out.

01:49:38.089 --> 01:49:42.009
I think Powers is hot for you.
You better watch your back.

01:49:42.092 --> 01:49:44.553
<i>Let's move out, Recon. Form up.</i>

01:50:01.863 --> 01:50:03.031
Keep moving.

01:50:18.088 --> 01:50:19.547
Get down.

01:51:27.325 --> 01:51:29.535
<i>Bad mistake, coming in here like this.</i>

01:51:29.660 --> 01:51:33.414
<i>- It's my fault, Gunney. I led them up here.
- Apologize to their mothers.</i>

01:51:33.539 --> 01:51:34.790
<i>Jesus, Gunney!</i>

01:51:36.375 --> 01:51:38.586
Lay some steel on those targets there.

01:51:39.420 --> 01:51:40.421
Aponte!

01:51:42.424 --> 01:51:44.218
Radio Battalion for air support.

01:51:45.469 --> 01:51:47.346
<i>Gunney, I think Profile is dead.</i>

01:52:01.859 --> 01:52:03.653
<i>Don't let him die, Gunney.</i>

01:52:05.404 --> 01:52:07.031
That's not up to me.

01:52:07.448 --> 01:52:10.201
<i>Come on. Stay down, everyone. Let's go.</i>

01:52:16.207 --> 01:52:17.834
- How you doing?
- I'm okay.

01:52:18.085 --> 01:52:20.045
Doing better than Profile.

01:52:20.337 --> 01:52:21.964
I can still fight.

01:52:22.589 --> 01:52:24.049
We'll make it out of here?

01:52:24.132 --> 01:52:26.426
<i>- You got a date, Collins?
- You never know.</i>

01:52:30.430 --> 01:52:32.057
<i>Gunney, I got Profile killed.</i>

01:52:32.140 --> 01:52:35.811
<i>It was his time.
And when it's your time, your time is up.</i>

01:52:35.936 --> 01:52:37.729
I could have gotten them all killed.

01:52:37.854 --> 01:52:40.941
<i>Yes, but you didn't.
Just don't make the same mistake twice.</i>

01:52:41.233 --> 01:52:42.234
Right.

01:52:42.651 --> 01:52:45.320
I think I figured out a way to call
an air strike...

01:52:45.404 --> 01:52:47.698
...if we can find out where this line is cut.

01:52:47.823 --> 01:52:48.824
Jones!

01:52:49.825 --> 01:52:52.745
<i>- That's my name, loving's my game.
- Thanks for volunteering.</i>

01:52:53.454 --> 01:52:54.455
Say what?

01:52:54.664 --> 01:52:57.500
Get on the roof.
Find out where this line is cut.

01:52:57.917 --> 01:53:00.128
<i>Come on, men. Don't stand there, damn it.</i>

01:53:13.682 --> 01:53:17.019
<i>I wish I was back in New Jersey,
watching The Flintstones.</i>

01:53:17.269 --> 01:53:19.062
This is bullshit.

01:53:23.400 --> 01:53:25.986
Don't you motherfuckers know
who you're shooting at?

01:53:26.111 --> 01:53:28.406
I'm the Ayatollah of Rock-and-Roll-a.

01:53:29.407 --> 01:53:33.870
<i>Big banana-eating, bean-farting
motherfuckers don't speak English.</i>

01:53:34.579 --> 01:53:35.580
Hello?

01:53:35.914 --> 01:53:36.915
Hello?

01:53:38.291 --> 01:53:39.292
It works.

01:53:39.709 --> 01:53:42.795
<i>Damn right, it works.
I almost got my ass shot off for Ma Bell.</i>

01:53:43.755 --> 01:53:45.381
Hello? Operator?

01:53:45.840 --> 01:53:49.677
<i>Yes. I want to make an emergency,
long distance call...</i>

01:53:49.802 --> 01:53:53.473
<i>... to Camp Lejeune, North Carolina.
Collect.</i>

01:53:55.016 --> 01:53:56.017
What?

01:53:57.769 --> 01:54:00.688
Anybody have a credit card?
They won't make collect calls.

01:54:04.818 --> 01:54:08.489
<i>Have no fear. Stitch is here, and
I never go to combat without my plastic.</i>

01:54:12.660 --> 01:54:13.661
Yes.

01:54:14.245 --> 01:54:15.955
6-6-0...

01:54:16.205 --> 01:54:17.915
...5- 5-8...

01:54:18.498 --> 01:54:20.375
<i>... 0- 7- 1-1...</i>

01:54:21.876 --> 01:54:23.503
Camp Lejeune?

01:54:24.420 --> 01:54:26.047
Are you for real?

01:54:27.423 --> 01:54:31.177
Grid 2-1-9...

01:54:31.678 --> 01:54:36.392
...6- 3-2-1-8.

01:54:38.727 --> 01:54:41.397
- Did they get it?
- I don't know. The phone went dead.

01:54:43.148 --> 01:54:44.149
Give me that.

01:54:47.027 --> 01:54:48.571
<i>Gunney, where are you going?</i>

01:54:49.321 --> 01:54:51.991
<i>If they don't see our marker,
we'll be in real trouble.</i>

01:54:52.116 --> 01:54:54.076
But you don't know if we got through.

01:54:54.243 --> 01:54:55.869
<i>We'll have to improvise, sir.</i>

01:55:14.806 --> 01:55:16.099
Highway's been hit!

01:55:22.647 --> 01:55:24.441
<i>What are we going to do, sir?</i>

01:55:29.612 --> 01:55:30.946
Let's go.

01:56:04.105 --> 01:56:05.649
<i>Don't die, man.</i>

01:56:08.693 --> 01:56:09.694
Gunney!

01:56:12.280 --> 01:56:13.281
Jones.

01:56:15.116 --> 01:56:18.703
Just because we are holding hands
doesn't mean we'll take warm showers...

01:56:18.787 --> 01:56:21.540
...until the wee hours of the morning.
You hear me?

01:56:22.458 --> 01:56:25.878
- I thought you were dead.
- Wishful thinking.

01:56:30.967 --> 01:56:33.261
<i>Lieutenant, what are we waiting for?</i>

01:56:34.470 --> 01:56:38.598
<i>All right, you devil dogs,
let's take that fucking hill!</i>

01:58:57.990 --> 01:58:58.991
Go!

01:59:10.002 --> 01:59:11.545
Get them out of there.

01:59:13.088 --> 01:59:15.133
Move it! Get your hands up!

01:59:36.738 --> 01:59:38.031
<i>All secure, sir!</i>

01:59:38.865 --> 01:59:40.909
<i>- Corporal Jones!
- Yes, sir!</i>

01:59:43.036 --> 01:59:44.287
Move them out.

01:59:44.370 --> 01:59:46.164
<i>You heard him, men! Move them out!</i>

02:00:27.665 --> 02:00:30.668
Just what the hell do you think
you were doing?

02:00:34.922 --> 02:00:37.132
<i>Just enjoying the view, sir.</i>

02:00:38.634 --> 02:00:40.261
You disobeyed a direct order.

02:00:41.929 --> 02:00:45.599
I told you to stay in contact
and not take this hill without me.

02:00:47.935 --> 02:00:49.895
<i>Get on your feet, Highway!</i>

02:00:52.147 --> 02:00:56.360
<i>With all due respect, sir,
you're beginning to bore the hell out of me.</i>

02:01:33.148 --> 02:01:35.984
<i>- Who's in charge here?
- I am, sir. Major Malcolm Powers.</i>

02:01:36.568 --> 02:01:38.111
Did you lead this assault?

02:01:39.237 --> 02:01:42.908
<i>Lieutenant Ring and Gunnery Sergeant
Highway disobeyed a direct order, sir.</i>

02:01:43.825 --> 02:01:47.162
<i>I told them to wait for support,
but they still charged this hill.</i>

02:01:47.412 --> 02:01:48.496
Why?

02:01:48.705 --> 02:01:51.625
<i>Because we're paid to improvise, sir.
To overcome, to adapt.</i>

02:01:51.708 --> 02:01:53.835
<i>I gave the order to take this hill, sir.</i>

02:01:54.127 --> 02:01:56.421
<i>Ring, this is going to ruin your career.</i>

02:01:58.381 --> 02:02:01.885
<i>- Are you new to the infantry, Major?
- Yes, sir. I came over from Supply.</i>

02:02:02.010 --> 02:02:03.803
<i>- Were you good at that?
- Yes, sir!</i>

02:02:04.262 --> 02:02:08.309
<i>Then stick to it, because you're
a cluster fuck as an infantry officer.</i>

02:02:08.476 --> 02:02:10.603
<i>This is a Marine Amphibious Unit, Major.</i>

02:02:10.728 --> 02:02:12.355
My men are hard chargers.

02:02:12.438 --> 02:02:15.191
Ring and Highway
took a handful of young fire-pissers...

02:02:15.316 --> 02:02:18.027
<i>... exercised some personal initiative,
and kicked ass!</i>

02:02:20.363 --> 02:02:22.406
<i>- Good work, Lieutenant.
- Thank you, sir!</i>

02:02:22.949 --> 02:02:26.451
<i>Lieutenant, see that those students
are escorted back to Cherry Point.</i>

02:02:28.954 --> 02:02:30.413
You're dismissed!

02:02:51.227 --> 02:02:54.397
What are you two sorry-assed individuals
looking at?

02:02:54.522 --> 02:02:56.148
Get out of my LZ.

02:02:57.733 --> 02:02:59.277
<i>Semper Fi.</i>

02:03:04.156 --> 02:03:07.410
<i>Chooz, I guess we're not 0-1-1 now.</i>

02:03:47.283 --> 02:03:49.160
- There's my family.
- All right.

02:03:49.785 --> 02:03:51.580
- Got anybody here?
- No.

02:03:51.663 --> 02:03:55.417
But it's a beautiful day
and I'm ready to play.

02:03:55.542 --> 02:03:58.545
<i>- Give them hell, man.
- Definitely.</i>

02:04:11.183 --> 02:04:15.646
<i>Like I said, I'm ready to play.
You know what I mean?</i>

02:04:16.188 --> 02:04:18.148
<i>Anytime, man.</i>

02:04:18.649 --> 02:04:20.192
You'll be a civilian soon.

02:04:20.275 --> 02:04:24.655
<i>Grow your hair long, sleep late,
become an asshole rock and roll star.</i>

02:04:25.489 --> 02:04:28.493
Sergeant Major Choozoo
gave me re-up papers.

02:04:28.743 --> 02:04:30.203
And you signed them?

02:04:30.328 --> 02:04:33.331
<i>Yes, Gunney,
I'm a better Marine than I was a singer.</i>

02:04:33.748 --> 02:04:36.501
<i>You're also a lot dumber
than I thought you were, too.</i>

02:04:36.584 --> 02:04:37.835
What about you?

02:04:38.795 --> 02:04:42.924
<i>No, I've had it.
No room in this man's Corps for me now.</i>

02:04:43.507 --> 02:04:45.467
<i>Besides, they've got you.</i>

02:05:07.031 --> 02:05:11.035
I guess all of these marching bands
and parades are old stuff to you.

02:05:12.161 --> 02:05:14.539
<i>To tell you the truth, this is the first time.</i>

02:05:15.373 --> 02:05:17.875
There are my ladies.

02:05:18.001 --> 02:05:20.128
<i>Gunney, duty calls.</i>
