18:14.928 --> 18:16.661
(keys tap)

18:16.796 --> 18:18.195
(shaky exhale)

18:19.265 --> 18:22.132
Hey, is it okay
if we come over?

18:22.134 --> 18:23.935
- Make yourselves comfortable,
guys.

18:23.937 --> 18:25.469
Those scary movies
hit different

18:25.472 --> 18:27.471
When you're home alone,
don't they?

18:27.474 --> 18:29.740
- Yeah. I guess so.
- Well, don't you worry,

18:29.876 --> 18:31.342
I'm not good with the spooky
stuff, either.

18:31.344 --> 18:33.410
Hey, nathan jr, we got company!

18:33.446 --> 18:35.179
Come on, let's get some snacks.
- (small laugh)

18:36.316 --> 18:38.483
- Will the defendant
please rise?

18:40.019 --> 18:43.053
With respect to the charge
of assaulting a minor,

18:44.290 --> 18:47.024
I find the defendant... Guilty.

18:47.026 --> 18:48.425
Cheryl: Loser!
- Yeah!

18:48.461 --> 18:50.394
- Order! Order in the court!

18:51.664 --> 18:53.431
It gives me no great pleasure
doing this,

18:53.566 --> 18:55.633
But, lionel carlson,

18:55.702 --> 18:58.435
I sentence you to... Life.
- What?!

18:59.806 --> 19:03.073
- A life at least 500
kilometers from cochrane,

19:03.143 --> 19:05.710
As long as bennett brewer still
lives within its city limits.

19:05.712 --> 19:07.844
And a $1,500 fine.

19:07.881 --> 19:09.279
- (scoffs)
- is that bad?

19:09.315 --> 19:10.915
♪ yeah, yeah

19:10.984 --> 19:12.749
- (relieved exhale)
woo!

19:15.522 --> 19:18.455
Y, hey, full house.

19:18.491 --> 19:20.324
- Yeah, ella and charlie
are already in bed.

19:21.561 --> 19:24.328
Nathan jr. And alice
are gettin' pretty cozy there.

19:24.364 --> 19:26.330
Anything I should know?

19:26.332 --> 19:29.333
- Nope, just that the carlsons
are spending the night.

19:29.335 --> 19:31.068
Actually, hey, uh,

19:31.137 --> 19:32.603
Alice, would you put jayme
down, please?

19:32.639 --> 19:34.271
- Sure.
- Thanks, honey.

19:34.340 --> 19:36.306
I thought you had to stay
at the office late.

19:36.342 --> 19:38.675
- I managed to get out early,
so.

19:38.711 --> 19:40.945
- Good night, honey.
- Goodnight, girls.

19:41.014 --> 19:42.613
Alice: Good night.

19:44.984 --> 19:47.885
- Hey, can I turn this off?

19:47.887 --> 19:50.320
- Go ahead.
- Um...

19:51.925 --> 19:54.158
Sorry I couldn't take you
to the record signing today.

19:54.227 --> 19:56.360
And I know that this doesn't
make up for it, but...

19:58.031 --> 19:59.563
I hope it's a start.

20:00.733 --> 20:02.366
- "have a funky year,
tuba man?"

20:02.368 --> 20:04.501
- I know. I told him
you played the sax, but--

20:04.503 --> 20:06.437
- No-no, no,
that's his catchphrase.

20:06.506 --> 20:08.639
This is legendary!

20:08.708 --> 20:10.340
Thank you.

20:12.011 --> 20:13.543
- There's something
I wanna tell you.

20:14.614 --> 20:16.513
I think I was so worried
about not living up

20:16.549 --> 20:19.483
To your expectations,
that I did just that.

20:21.688 --> 20:23.654
But I'm here now.

20:23.723 --> 20:25.456
- Actually, there...

20:27.260 --> 20:29.993
There's something I-I need
to tell you, too.

20:32.798 --> 20:35.999
I wanted to tell you
for a while...

20:36.035 --> 20:37.668
<i> I don't know why I didn't.</i>

20:39.072 --> 20:41.405
- All right, team, we got
our work cut out for us.

20:41.407 --> 20:44.408
New pitches, my office!
I got pastries.

20:44.410 --> 20:46.410
Rosie: (gasps) kate!
You're here!

20:46.412 --> 20:48.378
- Oh, sorry,
do we have a meeting?

20:48.414 --> 20:51.715
- Even better. I'd like you
to meet the new sources.

20:53.253 --> 20:55.019
- What, for the book?
Uh, how did you--

20:55.088 --> 20:57.421
- It's funny how they'll open
up to one of their own.

20:57.457 --> 21:00.057
- And they're all willing to go
on record against goldie's?

21:00.126 --> 21:03.193
- We are.
Let's topple this pyramid.

21:06.099 --> 21:07.864
- Looks like we got ourselves
a whale.
