LITOS:
The gods have cursed you, Alexander.

00:03.080 --> 00:06.835
Flee tonight when the battle begins.
My men won't stop you.

00:06.880 --> 00:09.156
This was always a shabby war.

00:09.200 --> 00:13.717
I loved him, Nestor.
Tell the king it's over. We're done here.

00:14.760 --> 00:18.640
Whatever happens,
I'll never stop loving you.

00:20.600 --> 00:24.753
Go to the Greeks.
Speak to my husband.

00:24.800 --> 00:28.759
I have one condition:
no one else in this city is to be harmed.

00:28.800 --> 00:32.191
Not Alexander, no one. Tell him.

WAVES LAP

00:36.720 --> 00:38.597
MEN CHATTER DISTANTLY

01:01.560 --> 01:02.834
NESTOR: Odysseus!

01:19.200 --> 01:20.520
What did they do to you?

01:21.720 --> 01:23.119
Nothing I won't repay.

01:30.320 --> 01:32.516
I have a message from your wife,
my lord.

01:35.880 --> 01:37.359
What did she say?

01:38.480 --> 01:40.118
She wants to come home.

02:02.920 --> 02:04.240
AENEAS:
The patrols are back.

02:04.280 --> 02:05.395
No sign of him.

02:05.960 --> 02:07.997
PARIS:
You think he got out of the city?

02:08.039 --> 02:09.155
Looks that way.

02:09.199 --> 02:10.997
And once he makes it back to the Greeks

02:11.039 --> 02:12.110
he'll tell them we have no grain left.

02:12.160 --> 02:13.798
All they have to do is wait.

02:13.840 --> 02:15.558
Then we should attack
while we have the chance.

02:15.600 --> 02:17.477
Have you seen our soldiers?

02:17.520 --> 02:19.397
They can barely lift their swords.

02:20.160 --> 02:23.357
And if we do nothing?
In two weeks we'll be starving.

02:23.400 --> 02:24.595
PARIS:
He's right.

02:25.400 --> 02:26.629
Achilles is dead.

02:27.240 --> 02:29.516
This is our chance.
We have to take it.

02:29.560 --> 02:31.597
Defending the city is one thing.

02:32.360 --> 02:33.794
Attacking their camp is another.

02:33.840 --> 02:35.717
Then what do you suggest, brother?

02:41.560 --> 02:43.756
Perhaps we could negotiate a surrender.

02:46.280 --> 02:47.350
No.

02:47.760 --> 02:49.114
With Achilles dead
they'd listen to reason...

02:49.160 --> 02:50.594
Not while I'm commander.

02:53.080 --> 02:55.071
BABY MEWLS AND CRIES

03:07.240 --> 03:08.514
You're looking better.

03:08.560 --> 03:09.994
I heard the Greek escaped.

03:12.280 --> 03:14.032
Yes.
<i>—</i> That's convenient.

03:14.880 --> 03:16.029
Listen.

03:17.720 --> 03:19.950
Don't upset yourself anymore.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.832
You need to look after yourself.

03:22.080 --> 03:24.674
I need someone to hear what I'm saying.

03:25.240 --> 03:28.039
Alexander and Aeneas
will uncover the truth.

03:28.720 --> 03:30.996
You have a duty to your son now.

03:32.080 --> 03:33.514
Pandarus was no traitor.

03:34.280 --> 03:35.395
I know.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.638
That doesn't mean that Helen was.

03:40.440 --> 03:41.396
Tell him.

03:44.960 --> 03:46.234
Tell me what?

03:59.080 --> 04:00.673
PARIS:
So it's decided.

04:00.720 --> 04:03.519
Deiphobus, Aeneas and I
will launch our offensive.

04:03.560 --> 04:05.119
When will you attack?

04:06.960 --> 04:07.916
Dawn.

04:08.480 --> 04:10.437
Full assault. All our men.

04:13.800 --> 04:15.837
Any news on the Greek prisoner?

04:15.880 --> 04:17.154
We've searched the city.

04:17.680 --> 04:18.795
He's gone.

04:21.240 --> 04:22.913
Do you think he might have had help?

04:22.960 --> 04:24.155
What do you mean?

04:24.920 --> 04:27.958
Well, we were trying to get
information out of him.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.638
Suddenly he escapes.

04:30.680 --> 04:33.911
His hands were tied
and yet he kills a guard.

04:38.200 --> 04:42.034
Who in this room believes Pandarus
was a traitor?

04:42.080 --> 04:43.559
Why else would he hang himself?

04:44.800 --> 04:46.234
What if he didn't?

04:50.280 --> 04:52.191
Ask Adrasteia to come in.

04:52.240 --> 04:53.719
My lord.

04:59.520 --> 05:00.794
PRIAM:
Don't be frightened.

05:03.600 --> 05:05.238
Tell them what you told me.

05:07.160 --> 05:10.915
Lord Pandarus came to me once
in the widows' quarters.

05:13.080 --> 05:17.153
He asked me to report back anything
Princess Helen said or did.

05:19.280 --> 05:20.634
Did he say why?

05:21.840 --> 05:22.955
ADRASTEIA:
No, my lord.

05:23.560 --> 05:25.756
And did you obey his command?

05:27.800 --> 05:29.120
He died that night.

05:34.240 --> 05:35.913
Can you explain this?

05:37.160 --> 05:39.595
No, I don't know what she's talking about.

05:42.040 --> 05:43.155
What is this?

05:44.920 --> 05:46.433
What exactly are you suggesting?

05:46.840 --> 05:50.515
If Pandarus was asking questions
before he died

05:50.560 --> 05:52.437
I think we have a right to know why.

05:52.480 --> 05:54.198
Pandarus was a traitor.

05:54.240 --> 05:56.038
Was he?
<i>—</i> Yes.

05:57.720 --> 05:58.710
He was.

06:03.160 --> 06:04.355
Helen, come.

06:05.520 --> 06:06.840
We don't have to listen to this.

06:28.160 --> 06:29.195
Ignore them.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.514
They're just frightened,
they'll blame anyone.

06:39.080 --> 06:40.150
Listen.

06:42.040 --> 06:43.439
Don't attack tomorrow.

06:44.320 --> 06:45.754
I need you here.

06:46.600 --> 06:49.399
The longer we wait,
the weaker the men will be.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.320
Just a day or two.

06:52.280 --> 06:53.395
Please.

06:55.640 --> 06:57.438
What difference will that make?

07:25.400 --> 07:27.311
Do you think it could be possible?

07:27.360 --> 07:28.714
I don't know.

07:31.800 --> 07:33.518
What if we were wrong about her?

07:36.560 --> 07:38.278
What if we've always been wrong?

07:51.400 --> 07:52.356
PARIS:
Ready?

07:58.840 --> 08:00.239
It's a good day for it.

08:04.080 --> 08:05.991
Every day is good for killing Greeks.

08:09.080 --> 08:10.229
Troilus.

08:12.880 --> 08:14.518
Make sure the men are ready.

08:14.560 --> 08:15.959
Wait for our signal.

08:45.720 --> 08:46.835
Look for any weakness.

08:47.480 --> 08:50.040
I want to focus all our attack
on one point.

09:14.560 --> 09:16.949
Go back, get some men.
Search the hills.

09:35.640 --> 09:36.675

Where are they?

Madam!

09:49.440 --> 09:50.589
What is it?

09:51.240 --> 09:52.560
The Greeks have gone.

10:05.280 --> 10:07.510
Tell Troilus to keep the soldiers
on the walls.

10:09.320 --> 10:11.789
Keep the people inside
until we know it's real.

10:20.880 --> 10:22.951

Who is he?

11:57.720 --> 11:58.596
Greek.

11:59.600 --> 12:01.273
Found him tied up on the sand.

12:02.720 --> 12:05.519
One more hour, the tide would have
drowned him.

Thersites.

12:18.400 --> 12:19.993
Of Odysseus's army.

12:20.040 --> 12:23.237
Why did they leave you here?
<i>—</i> Menelaus ordered it.

12:23.760 --> 12:24.909
Why?

12:24.960 --> 12:27.190
I made a joke as
they were getting on board.

12:27.240 --> 12:28.514
What joke?

12:31.560 --> 12:33.597
I'd rather not say...
<i>—</i> What joke?

12:34.360 --> 12:36.954
I said I hoped his ship
wasn't as leaky as his wife.

12:40.360 --> 12:42.112
Is it true? Huh?

12:42.160 --> 12:43.070
Have they gone?

12:43.760 --> 12:45.671
They packed up last night.

12:45.720 --> 12:47.677
Set sail before dawn.

12:51.240 --> 12:52.719
Why did they leave now?

12:52.760 --> 12:54.239
Achilles is dead.

12:55.200 --> 12:56.679
Without him, they're nothing.

12:57.760 --> 13:01.549
Odysseus said he'd had enough
and wanted to go home, see his wife.

13:02.840 --> 13:05.070
And Agamemnon?
<i>—</i> Him, too.

13:06.920 --> 13:08.718
Menelaus tried to convince him to stay.

13:08.760 --> 13:10.114
They fought on the beach, but...

13:11.320 --> 13:12.196
you can guess who won.

13:14.160 --> 13:15.753
And this?

13:15.800 --> 13:16.949
It's an offering.

13:18.560 --> 13:19.675
To Poseidon.

13:22.520 --> 13:24.113
Agamemnon's idea.

13:25.720 --> 13:28.553
After what happened on the way here
with his daughter

13:28.600 --> 13:30.637
they wanted to be sure
the winds would obey.

13:32.640 --> 13:34.631
Open it. See for yourself.

13:44.760 --> 13:46.080

Get back!

There's wine as well!

13:47.440 --> 13:49.033
The last of the supplies.

13:49.080 --> 13:51.037
They expected the tide to take it.

13:51.080 --> 13:52.400
They didn't want you to have it.

13:52.440 --> 13:54.351
We should take it into the city.
<i>—</i> No.

13:54.400 --> 13:56.630
Don't be hasty.
<i>—</i> We need food.

13:56.680 --> 13:59.149
Why should they have the gods' blessing?
Let it be ours.

13:59.680 --> 14:02.035
I don't trust him. We should leave it.

14:02.080 --> 14:03.798
All things Greek are cursed.

14:03.840 --> 14:05.831
Let the sea take it.

14:05.880 --> 14:08.633
And lose a month's worth of grain?
No, no.

14:08.680 --> 14:09.909
We need it.

14:09.960 --> 14:12.634
The people need it. They need it.

14:12.680 --> 14:14.591
Father, Father!

14:14.640 --> 14:16.756
What if it's not a blessing?

14:19.080 --> 14:20.753
They have taken everything from us.

14:21.360 --> 14:23.078
They've killed our men, our children.

They've wrecked our city.

14:24.960 --> 14:27.031
Let's take something of theirs
for a change.

14:28.520 --> 14:30.113
We saw their boats on the ocean.

14:30.160 --> 14:32.390
We've checked the hills. They've gone.

14:32.880 --> 14:35.235
Let's steal their blessing from them

14:36.320 --> 14:39.153

Achilles stole into the city one night

He met someone who told him
we were receiving supplies from Cilicia.

17:34.120 --> 17:35.394

Killed my father.

it was someone with a grudge.

18:11.920 --> 18:15.231
Felt under-appreciated here, apparently.

21:31.160 --> 21:33.071
My son will live in a free city.

21:34.200 --> 21:35.599
I never thought I'd see it.

21:36.600 --> 21:37.874
I'm glad for you.

21:38.560 --> 21:40.437
Your children will, too.

21:44.920 --> 21:46.069
What do you mean?

21:47.080 --> 21:48.150
Oh, come on.

21:49.520 --> 21:51.033
Don't tell me you won't have them.

22:05.680 --> 22:07.591
CHEERS

22:11.040 --> 22:12.360
Now's your chance.

22:13.520 --> 22:14.999
They're waiting.

22:16.640 --> 22:18.039
You know the deal.

22:19.240 --> 22:20.992
They stay safe.

22:21.040 --> 22:22.394
But you go.

22:22.440 --> 22:24.511
Or it all begins again.

22:29.440 --> 22:30.430
THERSITES:
What is it?

22:31.640 --> 22:32.789
I can't.

22:33.480 --> 22:34.675
Excuse me?

22:36.000 --> 22:36.956
Please...

22:37.760 --> 22:39.273
get me out of this.

22:45.160 --> 22:46.992
Trying the old charm, eh?

22:48.360 --> 22:50.397
I'm a bit thick-skinned for that.

22:52.720 --> 22:54.074
You go now.

22:54.120 --> 22:55.554
Or I'll tell them everything.

22:56.200 --> 22:57.918
All your crimes.

22:58.960 --> 23:01.076
I swear by the gods they'll know it all.

23:44.880 --> 23:48.236
INDISTINCT CHATTER

23:58.400 --> 24:00.198
I have a message from my husband.

24:01.160 --> 24:03.720
You're to report to him in the palace
immediately.

24:06.480 --> 24:07.800
GUARD:
We're only obeying orders.

24:08.960 --> 24:12.191
You're drunk. You're to be replaced.

24:12.240 --> 24:14.880
GUARD:
We're not drunk, my lady, we're just...

24:48.360 --> 24:50.033
You're more beautiful than ever.

25:06.280 --> 25:08.271
You were given my conditions of return?

25:09.360 --> 25:10.350
Yes.

25:12.760 --> 25:14.273
And you accept them?

25:18.360 --> 25:19.509
Where is he?

25:21.840 --> 25:23.638
Is he celebrating?
<i>—</i> Don't touch him.

25:24.600 --> 25:26.318
No more bloodshed.

25:27.120 --> 25:29.714
You leave Alexander
to lead the city in peace.

25:31.400 --> 25:33.232
Or I'll die here with him.

25:35.360 --> 25:36.998
I accept your conditions.

25:41.200 --> 25:42.270
On my honour.

25:45.800 --> 25:47.757
ODYSSEUS:
There's a boat waiting in the harbour.

25:48.400 --> 25:49.720
We should go.

26:07.560 --> 26:10.200
Hey. What is it?

26:17.440 --> 26:18.430
Don't worry about him.

26:18.480 --> 26:20.278
He's just some Greek soldier
they left behind.

26:20.320 --> 26:21.993
His mouth is false.

26:54.680 --> 26:56.478
Open the gates, please.

26:56.520 --> 26:57.669
Yes, my lady.

27:24.240 --> 27:26.311
DISTANT REVELRY SOUNDS

27:28.960 --> 27:30.075
SHE WHISPERS:
Let's go.

27:39.960 --> 27:42.190
DISTANT MARCHING SOUND

27:42.240 --> 27:44.117
HELEN:
What is that noise?

27:57.040 --> 27:58.838
MARCHING SOUND APPROACHES

27:59.800 --> 28:01.438
Oh, no.

28:01.480 --> 28:02.675
No, no, no...

28:02.720 --> 28:04.677
No, no.

28:10.360 --> 28:12.874
You swore.

28:12.920 --> 28:15.150
On your honour.

28:15.200 --> 28:16.713
Thanks to you...

28:18.440 --> 28:19.919
I have no honour left.

28:21.680 --> 28:24.035
Did you ever think I would let
that bastard live?!

28:24.760 --> 28:26.239
Let any of them live?!

28:27.800 --> 28:31.794
HELEN SCREAMS

28:36.440 --> 28:38.590
Here she is. The prize.

28:39.280 --> 28:41.078
Don't touch me!

28:41.120 --> 28:43.555
You have no idea
what you've put us through.

28:43.600 --> 28:45.193
Noidea.

28:45.240 --> 28:48.471
Odysseus! Please! Please!

28:48.520 --> 28:50.113
HELEN SCREAMS

28:50.800 --> 28:53.235
Odysseus, open the upper gate.
Let's go.

28:55.800 --> 28:56.915
MENELAUS:
Keep her here.

28:56.960 --> 28:59.759
Surround the city. No one leaves.

28:59.800 --> 29:00.835
SOLDIER:
Yes, sir.

29:01.160 --> 29:03.071

29:08.720 --> 29:09.994
Cassandra?

29:12.320 --> 29:13.515
What's wrong?

29:13.560 --> 29:15.278
The Greeks! They're here!

29:16.320 --> 29:17.674
Grab your weapons! Now!

29:17.720 --> 29:19.358

INDISTINCT SOLDIERS' YELLS

29:54.120 --> 29:55.190
Aeneas.

29:55.240 --> 29:57.311
Get my parents and the women
inside the palace.

29:57.360 --> 29:58.555
Seal the doors.

29:58.600 --> 30:00.159
You won't hold them here.
We need to find a way out.

30:00.800 --> 30:02.154
The tunnels we dug.

30:02.200 --> 30:03.599
Open them up.

30:06.800 --> 30:09.519
WAR CRY

30:18.360 --> 30:19.680
The Greek army's in the city!

30:19.720 --> 30:20.949
We need to open up the tunnels!

30:21.000 --> 30:23.071
Where's Alexander?
<i>—</i> He's holding them as long as he can.

30:23.120 --> 30:26.511
Right, I want a chain of people
bringing the soil out of the tunnels.

30:26.560 --> 30:27.516
NQW!

30:28.280 --> 30:30.271
No, I want you safe.

30:33.800 --> 30:36.155
I'm going to join Alexander.
Get me my armour.

30:36.840 --> 30:38.672
SOLDIER:
Torch it all!

31:01.440 --> 31:02.760
Everyone fall back!

31:02.800 --> 31:04.393
We can't hold them here!

31:04.440 --> 31:05.475
Retreat!

31:08.400 --> 31:09.515
With me!

31:21.200 --> 31:22.315
Where's Helen?

Block this path!

31:57.440 --> 31:58.669
Hold!

32:07.560 --> 32:08.436
Fall back!

32:18.760 --> 32:21.354

32:39.880 --> 32:42.474
SOLDIER:
Clear them all out! Get them out!

32:42.520 --> 32:43.749
Let's take the women!

33:05.880 --> 33:07.200
Deiphobus!

33:08.400 --> 33:09.435
No!

33:12.200 --> 33:13.520
Get him inside!

33:20.960 --> 33:23.395
Hold your position!

33:28.560 --> 33:29.675
Hold!

33:30.880 --> 33:31.711
Troilus!

33:31.760 --> 33:32.750
I'll stay out with the men.

33:32.800 --> 33:34.029
Troilus!
<i>—</i> Go!

33:34.080 --> 33:36.071
Troilus, no! Troilus!

33:45.920 --> 33:47.149
Don't surrender.

33:57.000 --> 33:58.752
Where is your wife?

34:00.720 --> 34:01.949
I don't know.

34:13.440 --> 34:14.396
We need more time.

34:15.239 --> 34:16.196
We don't have it.

34:16.760 --> 34:18.433
Quickly. Quick, Evander.

34:42.480 --> 34:43.514
The Greeks!

34:44.960 --> 34:45.791
TROJANS SCREAM

34:45.840 --> 34:48.400
Get back!
Everyone back to the courtyard!

Come out!

35:15.160 --> 35:16.514

Brother.

35:46.440 --> 35:48.909
I'm... sorry...

Go! Go!

35:59.320 --> 36:00.879

Hide!

36:09.840 --> 36:11.069
GQ!

36:19.320 --> 36:20.674
There's no way out for them.

36:25.800 --> 36:26.870
Bring my wife.

36:26.920 --> 36:28.479
SOLDIER:
Yes, sir.

36:31.120 --> 36:32.599
I want her to see this.

36:49.080 --> 36:51.799
DOG BARKS

37:02.720 --> 37:04.711
DOG WHIMPERS
— I'll look.

37:19.000 --> 37:20.399
Anything?

37:24.880 --> 37:25.836
No one.

37:41.560 --> 37:42.516
This way.

37:59.720 --> 38:00.915
Alexander!

38:05.320 --> 38:06.913
I've brought your wife!

38:13.360 --> 38:15.112
She's got something to tell you!

38:24.760 --> 38:26.433
MENELAUS:
Come out and talk to her!

38:32.080 --> 38:33.150
AENEAS GROANS IN PAIN

38:34.680 --> 38:35.829
Aeneas.

38:38.840 --> 38:39.875
Hide yourself.

38:41.640 --> 38:42.755
It's me they want.

38:44.520 --> 38:45.635
No.

38:45.680 --> 38:46.750
We'll face them together.

38:46.800 --> 38:47.835
You're wounded.

38:49.840 --> 38:51.035
You can't help me.

38:53.040 --> 38:54.474
You have to live.

38:57.960 --> 38:59.234
For all of us.

39:42.120 --> 39:44.839
SOLDIER SHOUTS ORDERS

39:56.920 --> 39:58.558
This is the end, isn't it?

CASSANDRA SHIVERS

40:25.000 --> 40:26.115
CASSANDRA GASPS LIGHTLY

40:37.000 --> 40:38.559
No, please.

40:39.200 --> 40:41.032
SHE SCREAMS
<i>—</i> Come here!

40:41.080 --> 40:42.479
CASSANDRA SCREAMS

40:42.520 --> 40:44.670
What is that?
<i>—</i> Cassandra!

40:47.920 --> 40:49.354
Quickly, in here.

41:07.720 --> 41:10.234
Brave to the last.

41:11.040 --> 41:13.600
You rape my CHIS'!

41:14.160 --> 41:16.356
You defile my daughter!

41:17.680 --> 41:19.478
Don't talk to me about daughters.

41:22.000 --> 41:23.434
You'll pay for this.

41:25.720 --> 41:26.790
The gods will see to it.

41:45.560 --> 41:46.959
HECUBA WAILS

41:48.680 --> 41:49.829
Wait.

41:50.520 --> 41:51.919
HECUBA WAILS

41:53.680 --> 41:55.114
<i>MET N. CLATTERS</i>

42:09.840 --> 42:11.274
HECUBA GASPS
AND STOPS BREATHING

42:57.880 --> 42:58.870
So...

43:02.120 --> 43:03.269
this is the bed.

43:09.640 --> 43:11.711
What do you think, my darling? Hm?

43:15.520 --> 43:16.715
Shall we tell him?

43:21.040 --> 43:22.394
You want the truth, shepherd?

43:27.280 --> 43:29.317
She's the one who let us in.

43:32.760 --> 43:33.955
You're lying.

43:34.000 --> 43:36.719
He promised to spare you.

43:37.320 --> 43:39.675
To save the city.

43:39.720 --> 43:40.869
On his honour.

43:40.920 --> 43:43.480
She betrayed you, Prince.

43:45.480 --> 43:47.278
She met with Achilles that night.

43:49.720 --> 43:51.233
She betrayed Cilicia.

43:53.440 --> 43:55.238
And she betrayed your family.

43:56.960 --> 43:58.553
She was never yours.

43:58.600 --> 44:00.273
HELEN:
Not true!

44:00.320 --> 44:02.755
I was always yours.

44:03.480 --> 44:05.039
And I always will be.

44:05.080 --> 44:06.150
You shut your mouth!

44:07.160 --> 44:08.116
I love him.

44:08.160 --> 44:10.276
I love him. You hear me?
<i>—</i> I said enough!

44:10.320 --> 44:11.594
I love...
SHE GASPS

44:37.680 --> 44:40.513
Live all your life...

44:42.760 --> 44:44.512
you'll never have...

44:45.480 --> 44:46.800
what we had.

44:52.560 --> 44:54.756
You'll never know how that feels.

46:07.960 --> 46:09.075
|\/|y lady.

46:15.040 --> 46:16.189
Come with me.

46:27.000 --> 46:29.071
BABY CRIES

46:37.760 --> 46:39.671
CRIES CONTINUE

46:54.880 --> 46:57.838
DIOMEDES: We've cleared the lower city.
There's no one left alive.

47:24.640 --> 47:26.790
None of this would have happened

47:27.960 --> 47:30.315
if it wasn't for you opening your legs

47:31.200 --> 47:33.316
and insulting your rightful master.

47:36.920 --> 47:38.991
He was never my master.

47:40.480 --> 47:41.879
As you know.

47:43.280 --> 47:45.510
You'll go back with my brother now.

47:46.680 --> 47:48.114
Bear him more children

47:48.920 --> 47:50.115
if <i>he</i> wants them.

47:52.520 --> 47:53.749
And then you can die.

48:30.920 --> 48:32.877
I forgive you, Wife.

48:37.680 --> 48:39.079
Let me bury him.

48:40.320 --> 48:41.879
What do you take me for?

48:43.680 --> 48:45.910
We will leave his body for the crows.

48:47.560 --> 48:48.994
That's all he deserves.

48:55.800 --> 48:57.279
Menelaus.

48:59.480 --> 49:01.153
You can take my body back.

49:03.160 --> 49:04.639
You can have it in your bed.

49:07.520 --> 49:09.238
But my heart stays here.

49:26.480 --> 49:27.993
Got your filthy prize?

49:31.200 --> 49:32.952
ANDROMACHE:
You're welcome to her.

49:35.320 --> 49:38.199
You women of Troy are now the property
of Mycenae and the Greek Kings.

49:40.280 --> 49:42.078
You will return to Greece with us.

49:43.360 --> 49:45.351
We will decide among ourselves
how to distribute you

49:45.400 --> 49:48.119
as compensation for injuries done
by your husbands and sons.

49:49.160 --> 49:51.674
Bring them. And her.

49:54.520 --> 49:55.669
Leave her!

49:59.720 --> 50:01.677
My lady, it's best if we leave quickly.

50:08.000 --> 50:09.957
BABY CRIES DISTANTLY

50:16.920 --> 50:17.910
What is that?

50:18.560 --> 50:19.630
Nothing.

50:19.680 --> 50:21.159
Our business is done here.

50:26.600 --> 50:27.476
What the hell is that?

Whose is it?

50:51.640 --> 50:52.630
Hers.

50:58.160 --> 51:00.197
I found them hiding in the family tomb.

51:01.000 --> 51:02.752
By her husband's body.

51:08.840 --> 51:10.513
He said he found her alone.

51:25.760 --> 51:27.159
An heir to Troy?

51:28.920 --> 51:30.115
We can't have that.

51:30.160 --> 51:32.197
No! No!
No, no, no, no... Give him to me!

51:32.240 --> 51:33.753
Give him to me!

51:33.800 --> 51:35.837
Take me. Have me. Spare him.

51:35.880 --> 51:37.393
Do what you want with me.

51:37.440 --> 51:40.353
Kill me. Have me.

51:43.280 --> 51:44.395
Odysseus.

51:48.400 --> 51:49.674
You throw it off the walls.

52:07.760 --> 52:08.830
No.

52:09.680 --> 52:11.751
There must be no future King of Troy.

52:11.800 --> 52:12.835
You know that.

52:14.840 --> 52:16.114
You do it.

52:17.440 --> 52:20.273
And then we can all go home
to our wives and our children.

52:23.160 --> 52:25.595

54:51.800 --> 54:54.235
Odysseus, may your crimes
haunt you like ghosts.

54:57.440 --> 54:58.760
May the gods plague you

55:00.040 --> 55:02.759
and may your heart be shattered
as mine is now.

55:05.440 --> 55:08.080
May Troy be the curse
that follows you all your life.

57:14.840 --> 57:15.796
It's alright.

57:21.800 --> 57:23.154
