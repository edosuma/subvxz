00:42.125 --> 00:43.125
<i>Time.</i>

00:46.625 --> 00:47.625
<i>Space.</i>

00:49.375 --> 00:50.375
<i>Reality.</i>

00:53.208 --> 00:55.000
<i>It's more than a linear path.</i>

00:59.875 --> 01:04.542
<i>It's a prism of endless possibility,</i>

01:06.833 --> 01:10.333
<i>where a single choice</i>
<i>can branch out into infinite realities,</i>

01:13.042 --> 01:16.042
<i>creating alternate worlds</i>
<i>from the ones you know.</i>

01:19.917 --> 01:21.167
<i>I am the Watcher.</i>

01:23.500 --> 01:26.667
<i>I am your guide</i>
<i>through these vast new realities.</i>

01:28.250 --> 01:31.917
<i>Follow me and ponder the question...</i>

01:35.333 --> 01:36.708
<i>"What if?"</i>

01:50.917 --> 01:52.792
For the win. This is it.

01:55.583 --> 01:57.208
And this is it, for the win.

01:58.792 --> 02:01.083
For the win. This is it.

02:02.167 --> 02:03.458
For the...

02:04.250 --> 02:07.250
Yes! First try.
Jane, you owe me 50--

02:07.333 --> 02:09.083
-Uh... Oh! Uh...

02:09.167 --> 02:10.875
Uh, Jane, Jane, Jane!

02:10.958 --> 02:12.708
It's beeping! It's doing the beeping!

02:14.125 --> 02:16.375
I need to talk
to the director of S.H.I.E.L.D.

02:16.458 --> 02:17.958
Because, if my data is correct,

02:18.042 --> 02:19.708
I believe an alien invasion
is imminent and...

02:19.792 --> 02:20.792
-Hello?

02:22.250 --> 02:25.042
Two years ago, the same anomaly
struck Star Alpha Icarus

02:25.125 --> 02:27.708
and the entire star dimmed
and then, poof, disintegrated.

02:28.958 --> 02:32.458
Yes, I know this is the Parks Department,
but isn't there something you can do?

02:32.542 --> 02:34.625
Talking about the end of the world,
my dude.

02:39.792 --> 02:41.625
They're here.

02:41.708 --> 02:44.208
We're too late. The invasion has begun.

02:51.208 --> 02:52.208
-Holy moly!
-Oh!

02:56.167 --> 02:57.750
Citizens of Midgard...

02:59.417 --> 03:02.708
...your dull lives are about
to come to an end.

03:02.792 --> 03:05.083
-Prepare yourselves...

03:08.458 --> 03:11.208
for the party prince!

03:14.583 --> 03:17.583
-This is gonna be awesome. Whoo!

03:17.667 --> 03:19.708
More than battles won or lost,

03:19.792 --> 03:22.583
it's relationships
that truly define a hero.

03:22.667 --> 03:24.958
The people who shape them, their stories.

03:25.875 --> 03:29.500
<i>Thor and Loki, a brotherhood</i>
<i>so strong and pivotal,</i>

03:29.583 --> 03:31.708
<i>it would change the fate of a universe.</i>

03:32.708 --> 03:36.083
<i>Their childhood taught Thor many lessons.</i>

03:37.292 --> 03:38.708
<i>But in another universe,</i>

03:38.792 --> 03:42.917
<i>instead of raising the Jotunheim prince,</i>
<i>Loki, as his own son,</i>

03:43.000 --> 03:45.333
<i>Odin returned him to his people.</i>

03:45.417 --> 03:49.333
<i>Without his trickster brother</i>
<i>to keep things, let's say, lively,</i>

03:49.417 --> 03:52.458
<i>Thor grew into a very different prince.</i>

03:57.708 --> 04:00.083
Rest, my love.

04:00.167 --> 04:04.292
Allow the Odinsleep to restore
your body and soul.

04:17.750 --> 04:20.292
He's asleep. And, uh...

04:20.375 --> 04:23.458
I'm off to my sister's
to celebrate the solstice.

04:23.542 --> 04:27.042
Now, this is your first taste of kinghood,
my prince.

04:27.125 --> 04:28.417
I expect you to study,

04:28.500 --> 04:31.000
read up on the Nine Realms
that you will one day rule.

04:31.083 --> 04:32.208
Of course, Mother.

04:32.292 --> 04:34.208
-No parties.
-Of course, Mother.

04:34.292 --> 04:36.500
Remember,
Heimdall will be watching.

04:38.167 --> 04:40.292
Wait, what? You can't be serious.

04:40.375 --> 04:41.458
Behave.

04:48.458 --> 04:49.708
Oh, Heimdall, there you are.

04:50.250 --> 04:53.667
Just off to study.
Books won't read themselves.

04:53.750 --> 04:55.042
But your mother said--

04:55.125 --> 04:56.750
Don't be such a wet blanket, Hogun.

04:56.833 --> 04:59.792
Oh, guys, stop. My father has
ruled Asgard for centuries.

04:59.875 --> 05:02.667
And, look, the most interesting thing
that he's ever done is fall asleep.

05:02.750 --> 05:06.750
He only cares about duty
and blah-blah-blah-blah responsibility.

05:06.833 --> 05:09.958
Well, I'm not gonna be like him, right?
The boring king? Uh-uh.

05:11.333 --> 05:16.667
But Heimdall sees all.
If we try anything, he'll call Frigga.

05:16.750 --> 05:18.250
Oh, ye of little faith.

05:18.333 --> 05:20.500
We are going to the most backward,

05:20.583 --> 05:23.750
backwater planet that not even
Heimdall pays attention to.

05:23.833 --> 05:25.250
Alert the realms.

05:26.750 --> 05:29.500
-Party on Midgard!

05:29.583 --> 05:31.125
Yes!

05:31.208 --> 05:32.542
Huzzah!

05:32.625 --> 05:35.042
To Thor, the party prince!

05:35.125 --> 05:37.208
-Welcome! Welcome, friends.
-Party prince!

05:37.292 --> 05:38.625
Enjoy the night.

05:38.708 --> 05:39.708
Thunder hug.

05:41.042 --> 05:43.375
Here, have a drink.
It never runs out.

05:43.458 --> 05:47.292
You try to drink it all,
but you can't because it's magic! Huzzah!

05:47.375 --> 05:51.125
Huzzah!
Thor! Thor! Thor! Thor! Thor!

05:52.292 --> 05:54.958
Hollywood movies did not
prepare me for this.

05:55.042 --> 05:58.375
Shouldn't there be more lasers?
Probing? A flying cow?

05:58.458 --> 05:59.542
According to my data,

05:59.625 --> 06:02.792
the first extraterrestrial
to arrive was...

06:02.875 --> 06:04.667
-Him?

06:10.875 --> 06:13.375
Huh. I expected him to look more like...

06:13.458 --> 06:17.083
Like what? E.T.? And less like
a hottie McScotty, beach body Ken,

06:17.167 --> 06:20.708
old-school Abercrombie catalog?
I could go on. Let me.

06:20.792 --> 06:21.917
I'm gonna go talk to him.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.750
I'm gonna make first contact
with an alien.

06:23.833 --> 06:26.250
First? I think half the Strip
beat you to it.

06:26.333 --> 06:27.917
You can make first contact with...

06:28.000 --> 06:30.333
I don't know, that guy.
He looks like a loser.

06:30.417 --> 06:32.542
Ha! Big talk coming from a brunette.

06:33.500 --> 06:35.583
I'm going. How do I look?

06:35.667 --> 06:38.375
Completely unprepared
for whatever happens next.

06:38.458 --> 06:39.875
Oh, do me, do me.

06:40.458 --> 06:44.250
Yes, you do me.
You do me, and you too.

06:44.333 --> 06:47.292
Oh, you guys really get me. Yes?

06:47.875 --> 06:49.333
Huh? Oh.

06:49.417 --> 06:52.083
Oh, there you are, all the way down there.

06:52.167 --> 06:54.583
So tiny, I almost stood on you.
How are you?

06:54.667 --> 06:57.125
I'm Dr. Jane Foster of Earth.

06:57.208 --> 06:59.375
Yeah, Thor, Crown Prince of Asgard.

06:59.458 --> 07:02.083
Uh, libations, cruditÃ©, baked goods?

07:02.167 --> 07:04.292
Mmm. Topaz, what do I always say?

07:04.375 --> 07:05.542
-I love cake.
-Mmm.

07:05.833 --> 07:07.667
Wait, wait, wait. You're Thor?

07:07.750 --> 07:10.375
As in Thor, the Norse god of thunder?

07:10.458 --> 07:14.750
I don't know anything about horse gods,
but I do know how to bring the thunder.

07:14.833 --> 07:17.417
Uh... Okay, moving on.

07:17.500 --> 07:20.417
Eighteen months ago,
Alpha Star Icarus died.

07:20.500 --> 07:22.125
The astronomaly that preceded it...

07:22.208 --> 07:24.250
-...happened again tonight.
-Don't drink too much.

07:24.333 --> 07:26.042
-Or too little.
-Hey, thunder boy.

07:26.125 --> 07:28.250
What I'm asking is, was that you?

07:28.333 --> 07:32.000
Yes, Alpha Star.
Now, that was an excellent party.

07:32.083 --> 07:34.083
You know, we lost Fandral for three days.

07:34.167 --> 07:36.917
Found him in a barn,
curled up next to a baby goat.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.875
It was classic. Isn't that right, Fandral?

07:38.958 --> 07:40.875
I named him Gary.

07:40.958 --> 07:42.292
-Yeah, you did.
-Yeah, goats!

07:42.375 --> 07:43.625
You killed a planet.

07:43.708 --> 07:46.417
Oh, what is that light box thing
you've got there?

07:46.500 --> 07:49.292
Oh, it's magic. I love magic.
Did you build this all by yourself?

07:49.375 --> 07:52.875
Excuse me? I happen to be
an astrophysicist with multiple PhDs.

07:52.958 --> 07:56.375
You know, it would take a whole
team of Asgardians to create such a thing.

07:56.458 --> 07:59.625
You must be a genius.
You are a genius, aren't you?

07:59.708 --> 08:02.292
Well, I don't know
about genius, but...

08:02.375 --> 08:03.875
-And your eyes...

08:03.958 --> 08:07.333
Do all geniuses have such deep, dark eyes?

08:07.417 --> 08:10.625
It's like watching the birth of two stars
on the edge of the galaxy.

08:10.708 --> 08:12.500
Oh.

08:14.208 --> 08:17.042
Well, it's happy hour.
Want some half-price nachos?

08:17.125 --> 08:20.042
Okay, fine, Duck. But this is not a date.

08:20.125 --> 08:21.750
Let's just see where this evolves.

08:33.458 --> 08:34.708
-Huh?

08:34.792 --> 08:35.875
Release the foam.

08:39.542 --> 08:41.250
-Blow on these.

08:41.333 --> 08:42.833
Momma needs a brand-new eye.

08:51.208 --> 08:54.000
Volstagg has crashed!

08:54.083 --> 08:56.167
I now pronounce you Darcy and the Duck.

08:56.250 --> 08:57.292
<i>Uh-huh</i>

09:20.125 --> 09:21.542
-Ah.

09:22.542 --> 09:24.083
Ah, phone.

09:31.667 --> 09:36.167
Ah, phone... Phone! Oh, shut up!

09:39.083 --> 09:40.417
Dr. Jane Foster?

09:40.500 --> 09:42.750
Coming. I'm coming.

09:42.833 --> 09:44.625
Dr. Jane Foster!

09:44.708 --> 09:46.375
Hold on.

09:46.458 --> 09:48.833
Dr. Jane Foster,
this is S.H.I.E.L.D.

09:51.917 --> 09:53.292
If you do not answer, we will--

09:53.375 --> 09:54.792
Yes?

09:54.875 --> 09:55.875
We have her, ma'am.

09:55.958 --> 09:58.208
Maria Hill,
Acting Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.

09:58.292 --> 09:59.667
-You need to come with us.
-Uh...

10:00.958 --> 10:04.042
Can this wait until after breakfast?
'Cause...

10:04.125 --> 10:08.292
You were the first to warn us
about this extraterrestrial threat.

10:08.375 --> 10:11.625
Now I hope you will be the key
to eliminating it.

10:11.708 --> 10:14.708
"Threat"? Would you call him
a threat, really?

10:14.792 --> 10:18.708
Do you wanna know why I am
the Acting Director, Dr. Foster?

10:18.792 --> 10:20.042
Nope.

10:20.125 --> 10:24.750
Hey, Spicoli. This might be your party,
but this isn't your planet.

10:24.833 --> 10:26.583
Before someone gets hurt, I need...

10:26.667 --> 10:27.667
Ball cannons!

10:31.375 --> 10:32.417
Oh!

10:32.500 --> 10:34.417
-Is he okay?
-He's still unconscious.

10:36.083 --> 10:37.208
We getting food?

10:37.292 --> 10:38.833
Do you have company, Dr. Foster?

10:38.917 --> 10:40.458
-Uh... A friend.

10:40.542 --> 10:43.208
Guys, guys, look.
There's a cute little rabbit in the sink.

10:43.292 --> 10:46.083
Oh, look at this little rabbit.
It's gorgeous.

10:46.167 --> 10:49.000
He's... a zoologist. I'll call you, okay?

10:51.958 --> 10:53.375
I told you everything.

10:53.458 --> 10:55.583
I followed the anomaly's origin to Vegas.

10:55.667 --> 10:57.083
And then what did you do?

10:57.167 --> 11:00.375
Um... Uh...

11:00.458 --> 11:02.833
Director, the party atmosphere
seems to be spreading.

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
Canada, Mongolia,
even Pennsylvania Dutch country.

11:07.083 --> 11:10.167
Led by the main instigator,
Thor of Asgard,

11:10.250 --> 11:11.750
who's now taken to the skies.

11:11.833 --> 11:14.125
What? He left?

11:14.208 --> 11:17.083
Did he... Did he even leave a note at...

11:17.833 --> 11:21.042
I mean, did...
Did he say where he was going?

11:21.125 --> 11:22.625
-Smooth.
-Thanks.

11:22.708 --> 11:24.250
-Sarcasm.
-Paris.

11:24.333 --> 11:28.250
One of his compatriots was,
and I quote, "jonesing for crÃªpes."

11:28.333 --> 11:29.333
Ma'am...

11:30.792 --> 11:32.375
the last resort has arrived.

11:32.458 --> 11:35.500
Whoa, whoa.
"Last resort" sounds very final.

11:35.583 --> 11:38.375
This is Earth's first encounter
with alien life.

11:38.458 --> 11:41.333
How we respond today will set the tone
for diplomatic relations

11:41.417 --> 11:43.333
between our worlds for generations.

11:43.417 --> 11:47.667
"Diplomatic relations"?
Is that what the kids are calling it?

11:47.750 --> 11:48.875
You're wrong, Doctor.

11:48.958 --> 11:51.708
This isn't S.H.I.E.L.D.'s
first alien rodeo.

11:52.667 --> 11:56.375
A beeper? My dad has one!
He's a podiatrist.

11:56.458 --> 11:58.750
Wait, are you guys calling a podiatrist?

12:01.625 --> 12:02.625
It's done.

12:04.250 --> 12:07.208
Is it happening? Did it happen?
What'd I miss?

12:08.000 --> 12:09.792
All right, here we go. Nestle on in.

12:09.875 --> 12:12.708
-Everyone say "waffles." I love that word.
-Cheese.

12:12.792 --> 12:14.875
Waffles with maple syrup
and whipped cream on top.

12:14.958 --> 12:15.958
-Thor!
-Thor!

12:16.042 --> 12:17.417
He came! He's here!

12:17.917 --> 12:22.167
Oi! Where's that son of a witch,
Thor Odinson?

12:23.208 --> 12:25.125
What did you say?

12:25.208 --> 12:30.083
Fandral, tell me, is that butt-ugly
popsicle stick talking to me?

12:39.583 --> 12:41.500
-Bring it on in.
-I can't believe you came!

12:41.583 --> 12:43.667
Loki, you are the absolute best!

12:43.750 --> 12:45.750
You're my brother
from another mother, man. I mean that.

12:45.833 --> 12:47.625
-I mean it.
-Brothers forever.

12:47.708 --> 12:49.542
<i>Brothers forever!</i>

12:49.625 --> 12:50.917
Forever!

12:52.292 --> 12:54.625
Wait, what's that boom? Did you boom?

12:54.708 --> 12:56.583
No, I didn't boom.
Did you boom? You always boom.

12:56.667 --> 12:59.042
-I never boom. I only boom in private.

12:59.125 --> 13:02.542
Oh, oh, oh. Loki, look,
it's a shooting star. Make a wish, quick!

13:02.625 --> 13:05.292
Yes, yes, a shooting star.
Yes, okay. I wish... I wish...

13:06.792 --> 13:09.417
I wish, I wish, I wish... I wish...

13:11.667 --> 13:13.833
-Uh... I've got it!
-What is it? Tell me.

13:13.917 --> 13:16.625
I couldn't possibly tell you.
It'll ruin the magic.

13:16.708 --> 13:17.708
Oh.

13:26.125 --> 13:29.042
Hey, Whitesnake. We need to chat.

13:29.125 --> 13:34.625
The name is Thor, with a "T"
and an "R" and an "O" and a "H."

13:34.708 --> 13:35.833
But not in that order.

13:35.917 --> 13:38.583
-Quite some party you're throwing.
-Isn't it the best?

13:38.667 --> 13:41.042
I mean, I'd hoped the Ice Bros would show,

13:41.125 --> 13:43.083
but Loki himself? Prince Loki?

13:43.167 --> 13:45.417
Are you kidding?
I wouldn't miss this for the world.

13:45.500 --> 13:48.417
Listen, bud, clean up this mess
and leave this planet.

13:48.500 --> 13:51.167
What? No, I like it here.
Everyone likes me.

13:51.250 --> 13:53.500
We're having a great time...
till you showed up.

13:53.583 --> 13:55.333
Party's over, pal.

13:55.417 --> 14:00.250
Mmm. Yeah, maybe here's a thought.
Uh, how about you just buzz off?

14:04.750 --> 14:05.750
Oh!

14:11.417 --> 14:13.333
I wasn't asking, hotshot.

14:14.917 --> 14:18.625
You know, there's a Midgardian word
for women like you.

14:20.375 --> 14:21.667
Party pooper.

14:22.500 --> 14:24.375
There. I said it.

14:24.458 --> 14:26.958
Okay, this one's for Fury.

14:31.417 --> 14:32.667
Now, for the rest of you...

14:40.917 --> 14:42.833
Have at you!

14:42.917 --> 14:45.125
Smooth move, bro. You just--

14:45.208 --> 14:46.833
Hammerang. Get it?

14:46.917 --> 14:49.208
Look, pal, I'm gonna count to three

14:49.292 --> 14:51.042
and you're gonna put the hammer down.

14:52.792 --> 14:55.125
Oh, here we go. Here we go.

14:58.500 --> 15:01.417
Hey, what did I tell you? Knock it off.

15:21.167 --> 15:22.750
-Whoa.

15:23.542 --> 15:25.917
Hey, quit it. These are...

15:26.000 --> 15:29.875
I don't know what these are. No one does.
But... No! I said no! Stop.

15:29.958 --> 15:33.125
Oh, but I just have to do a little boop.

15:42.250 --> 15:45.708
Oh, no, your weird rocks
have all fallen over.

15:45.792 --> 15:47.208
Boo-hoo-hoo-hoo.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.208
Ow!

16:02.583 --> 16:03.583
Party foul.

16:06.500 --> 16:09.500
Be right with you. Just one second.

16:10.125 --> 16:13.292
Ah, there it is. Whoo! Let's do this.

16:52.708 --> 16:54.833
You know, I'm starting to...

16:54.917 --> 16:56.958
Ow! Not the hair!

17:42.375 --> 17:43.375
You know what you need?

17:43.458 --> 17:45.875
A stiff drink and two weeks in Hawaii?

17:45.958 --> 17:47.167
A time-out.

17:47.250 --> 17:50.458
My mother punished me with time-outs
all the time, but I never learned a thing.

17:50.542 --> 17:54.750
But maybe they'll work on you
because you're a party pooper.

17:54.833 --> 17:57.292
Hey, look, everyone! A party pooper.

17:57.375 --> 18:00.375
Pooper! Pooper! Pooper!

18:05.292 --> 18:07.125
Fury said you were the best.

18:07.208 --> 18:10.375
That your punch was equal
to ten nuclear bombs.

18:10.458 --> 18:12.708
That your cat could devour whole armies.

18:12.792 --> 18:14.833
You've got a cat? What's its name?

18:14.917 --> 18:15.958
Goose.

18:16.042 --> 18:18.083
Oh, <i>Top Gun!</i> You're Maverick!

18:18.167 --> 18:20.500
Is your ego writing checks
that your skills can't cash?

18:20.583 --> 18:21.667
-No.
-Yes.

18:22.333 --> 18:24.750
-Who are you?
-Darcy. Big fan.

18:24.833 --> 18:27.458
By the way, totally thought
you were gonna be a dude captain.

18:27.542 --> 18:29.458
But look at you, all not.

18:29.542 --> 18:32.750
If I exert my full powers,
I blow a crater in this planet.

18:32.833 --> 18:36.042
Taking down Kappa Kappa frat freak
won't be worth the fatalities.

18:36.125 --> 18:37.917
Ooh. What about South Dakota?

18:38.000 --> 18:39.625
-Or North Dakota?

18:39.708 --> 18:42.417
-Uh... I need to get this.

18:42.500 --> 18:45.500
So, uh, do you need an intern?
Cat wrangler?

18:45.583 --> 18:47.750
Darcy, right now,
you're running at an eight,

18:47.833 --> 18:49.667
and I need you to take it down to a four.

18:49.750 --> 18:51.125
-Okay?

18:51.208 --> 18:52.375
-Hello?
-<i>Jane!</i>

18:52.458 --> 18:54.292
-Hey!
-When can I see you again?

18:54.375 --> 18:57.417
You're the nicest, prettiest
Midgardian woman I've ever met.

18:57.500 --> 18:59.292
How many Earth women have you met?

18:59.375 --> 19:01.292
Uh, two. But the other one
hit me with a bridge

19:01.375 --> 19:03.000
and, well, that hurt more than my face.

19:05.417 --> 19:07.500
Thor, be honest with me.

19:07.583 --> 19:11.292
At your last party on Alpha Star,
did you really destroy that planet?

19:11.375 --> 19:14.333
No, no, it was more of a meteor anyway,
not a planet.

19:14.417 --> 19:17.292
And it was burning apart,
so we just kinda helped it along and...

19:17.375 --> 19:18.500
So no one got hurt?

19:18.583 --> 19:19.875
-Of course not.
-Dr. Foster?

19:19.958 --> 19:22.208
Even the baby goat, Gary, got home safely.

19:22.292 --> 19:23.708
-Eventually.
-Dr. Foster.

19:23.792 --> 19:25.750
Uh, I gotta go. Love you. Oh.

19:25.833 --> 19:27.458
I mean, bye.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.167
What were we talking about?

19:30.250 --> 19:32.042
Look, all I'm saying is,

19:32.125 --> 19:34.708
no one would notice
if you blew up a Dakota.

19:34.792 --> 19:36.208
Honestly, I can't tell them apart.

19:36.292 --> 19:37.833
South Dakota is on the bottom.

19:37.917 --> 19:39.125
It's not a bad idea.

19:39.208 --> 19:41.000
The Mojave Desert could withstand the hit.

19:41.083 --> 19:43.708
Lure him to Siberia
and then go kaboom on his ass.

19:45.125 --> 19:47.958
You're not serious.
We're not gonna kaboom him.

19:48.042 --> 19:49.625
We're talking about the fate
of the planet.

19:49.708 --> 19:52.917
He's a lughead, sure, and far from
the brightest crayon in the box.

19:53.000 --> 19:57.250
But this plan is way over the top,
and I refuse to let it happen.

19:57.333 --> 20:00.458
Thank you for your expertise, Dr. Foster,

20:00.542 --> 20:03.333
but your assistance is no longer required.

20:06.458 --> 20:09.542
Damn! There goes my internship
with the Galactic Queen Bee.

20:09.625 --> 20:14.583
Well, look who came waddling back.
Mrs. the Duck.

20:14.667 --> 20:17.042
-Not now, Howard!
-Hello, Thor?

20:17.125 --> 20:18.875
-Who's this?
<i>-It's Jane. Can you hear me?</i>

20:18.958 --> 20:22.250
Wait. Is this the girl?
Thor's new sweet lady? Hello.

20:22.333 --> 20:23.375
Is Thor there?

20:23.458 --> 20:27.250
Late-night Chinese is the best.
Oh, I love food.

20:27.333 --> 20:30.208
Loki, get your blue butt over here.
You have to try these dumplings.

20:30.292 --> 20:33.458
Hey, Earth girl.
You haven't got a friend, have you?

20:33.542 --> 20:35.333
You know, we could double date.

20:35.417 --> 20:38.083
Ugh! Will you just put him on the phone?

20:38.167 --> 20:40.500
Oh, don't get your knickers in a twist.
He's right here... Oh!

20:44.167 --> 20:46.167
Oh. Right.

20:46.250 --> 20:47.417
Hello? Loki?

20:48.042 --> 20:51.125
-Hey, hey. Watch the feathers.

20:51.208 --> 20:53.667
-Too bad we can't call his mom.
-What?

20:53.750 --> 20:54.875
That's what always happens.

20:54.958 --> 20:57.167
Teenagers throw a party,
it gets out of control...

20:57.250 --> 20:59.167
-Oh, you really are a genius.
-Whoa.

20:59.250 --> 21:02.500
It's really starting to look that way,
isn't it? What'd I say?

21:02.583 --> 21:05.042
If there's a Thor and a Loki,

21:05.125 --> 21:09.542
then there must be an Odin
and a Frigga and a Heimdall!

21:09.625 --> 21:10.792
Uh, he-man-who-now?

21:15.708 --> 21:20.292
You know, I've got a crown too,
and we both like fire, right?

21:20.375 --> 21:22.583
Come on. Let's see you turn up
the heat on this thing.

21:22.667 --> 21:25.708
Uh... Ooh, look at the time.

21:30.333 --> 21:33.417
How low can I go?

21:40.083 --> 21:42.958
Everyone! Watch me slide down
that pointy thing.

21:46.125 --> 21:47.125
And away!

21:49.417 --> 21:51.250
Whoo!

22:02.542 --> 22:06.958
This one goes here. Green in the thing.
Okay, sweet. Good to go.

22:07.042 --> 22:08.125
Selvig, thank you.

22:08.208 --> 22:11.333
Re-aligning the satellites,
magnifying the signal.

22:13.458 --> 22:15.292
Heimdall!

22:17.333 --> 22:20.250
-It's not working.
-Okay, okay. My turn. I got this.

22:20.333 --> 22:23.667
Would the owner of the navy blue Prius...

22:38.208 --> 22:41.708
Hi. So, uh, about Thor...

22:48.083 --> 22:51.042
Not cool. I actually felt that one.

22:56.833 --> 22:58.875
-We're in position.
-Arm the nukes.

22:58.958 --> 23:01.000
What? But I thought she was the nuke.

23:01.083 --> 23:03.125
Just in case she gets distracted by a cat.

23:05.167 --> 23:09.958
Uh... Hello, Mrs. Odinwife?

23:10.667 --> 23:12.417
Uh, is that Chardonnay?

23:12.500 --> 23:15.292
A varietal, yes. Can I help you?

23:15.375 --> 23:18.042
Why do you insist on crushing my mellow?

23:18.125 --> 23:20.542
Huh? Loosen up. Have fun. Smile a little.

23:21.792 --> 23:23.208
Ready to fire on your command.

23:23.292 --> 23:25.167
Fire in five...

23:25.250 --> 23:28.583
I gave you a warning.
Hell, I gave you a warning punch.

23:28.667 --> 23:31.333
-Four.
-It's Thor. He's in trouble.

23:33.333 --> 23:35.083
-Three.
-He's on Earth.

23:36.083 --> 23:37.625
Two.

23:38.958 --> 23:40.875
-What about Captain Marvel?
-She'll be fine.

23:40.958 --> 23:42.458
One.

23:45.625 --> 23:50.667
Thor, Crown Prince of Asgard,
only son of Odin, what are you doing?

23:50.750 --> 23:52.083
-Mother!
-Mother?

23:52.167 --> 23:53.208
Mother?

23:53.292 --> 23:54.625
What are you doing here?

23:54.708 --> 23:57.625
You must be using a lot of dark magic
just to check in on me.

23:57.708 --> 24:01.167
Ugh, I had a visitor.
She's worried about you.

24:01.250 --> 24:03.625
Wha... Jane sold me out?

24:03.708 --> 24:05.542
She said you were on Midgard.

24:05.625 --> 24:07.333
Well, she is mistaken.

24:07.417 --> 24:10.250
I'm obviously in my room, studying.

24:13.792 --> 24:17.375
-Do not tell falsehoods to your mother.

24:17.458 --> 24:21.583
Oh, you mean Earth.
Sorry, I misunderstood.

24:21.667 --> 24:24.792
The locals call it that.
Yes, right. Sorry.

24:24.875 --> 24:26.417
Confused there for a moment.

24:26.500 --> 24:30.917
Me and my study group came down here
for a cultural exchange.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.375
"Cultural exchange."

24:33.458 --> 24:35.708
You know us. We're warriors for knowledge.

24:35.792 --> 24:39.417
Hmm. Really?
Then this I have to see for myself.

24:39.500 --> 24:41.375
I'm cutting my trip short.

24:41.458 --> 24:42.750
You're coming here?

24:42.833 --> 24:48.458
And, my sweet son, I expect to see
your full syllabus when I arrive.

24:49.833 --> 24:51.208
Now or never, Hill.

24:51.833 --> 24:53.458
Stand down. We're done here.

24:53.542 --> 24:56.167
We never get to fire the nukes.

24:56.250 --> 24:57.958
I almost feel bad for you, Blondie.

24:58.042 --> 25:00.958
Please, you must help me.
My mother is coming.

25:01.042 --> 25:04.708
My suggestion? Start in the corners,
clean your way outward.

25:07.083 --> 25:08.167
Corners, corners...

25:08.250 --> 25:10.292
But it's a sphere.

25:11.250 --> 25:15.875
Ugh. Excuse me, ladies. I'm sorry,
but I must leave early. Again.

25:17.583 --> 25:19.958
Loki, my brother.
I require your assistance.

25:20.042 --> 25:22.292
Ah, one step ahead of you, Tiny Thunder.

25:22.375 --> 25:25.708
My bro's trying this thing in St. Louis.
Saint... Is it "Louie"?

25:25.792 --> 25:27.375
Anyway, we're about to make

25:27.458 --> 25:29.917
-this universe's greatest slingshot.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.042
Try to enjoy
the rest of your time here.

25:32.125 --> 25:34.708
See you in another thousand years.
Heimdall.

25:36.250 --> 25:40.208
No more slingshots. No more destruction.
We need to clean this mess up and go home.

25:42.167 --> 25:43.667
Ugh! Now!

25:44.833 --> 25:47.958
Ha!
Nice one. Almost fell for it.

25:48.042 --> 25:50.875
I'm not joking. My mother is coming.

25:57.125 --> 25:58.125
Hmm.

25:58.208 --> 25:59.708
But she's not my mother.

25:59.792 --> 26:02.292
You know, I'm your brother
from another mother, remember?

26:02.375 --> 26:04.833
Come on, Ice Bros, let's go.

26:04.917 --> 26:06.750
Wait. You can't leave. Look at this place.

26:06.833 --> 26:09.333
We have a duty to this planet.
You need to clean it up.

26:09.417 --> 26:12.125
"Duty, clean"? Ugh, you sound like Odin.

26:12.208 --> 26:13.292
What?

26:13.375 --> 26:14.708
Ice Men, let's bounce.

26:18.375 --> 26:20.125
All right, listen, party's over.

26:20.208 --> 26:23.208
You don't have to go home,
but you can't stay.

26:23.292 --> 26:25.167
Wait, where you going? Come back.

26:25.250 --> 26:26.375
No, no, no, no, no.

26:26.458 --> 26:29.458
You do have to stay here,
and we need to clean up.

26:29.542 --> 26:31.750
Look who's pooping the party now.

26:31.833 --> 26:34.375
It is you! You are pooping the party.

26:34.458 --> 26:35.833
-Where you going? Come back!

26:35.917 --> 26:38.208
Let's go, Topaz.
We shall ride like the wind.

26:38.292 --> 26:39.583
-Please! Wait.
-Loser.

26:39.667 --> 26:41.292
And we're keeping the scoot-scoots.

26:41.375 --> 26:44.625
Guys, please. Help, I...
You. How about you?

26:44.708 --> 26:47.958
Uh... I think I hear my dad calling.
Good luck.

26:53.292 --> 26:57.542
People. Beings.
Please, everyone, you must stay and help.

27:00.417 --> 27:02.958
Allfather, give me strength.

27:08.375 --> 27:10.333
You will listen to me.

27:12.292 --> 27:14.125
My mother is coming.

27:14.208 --> 27:18.000
-Frigga?
-And she is not happy.

27:18.083 --> 27:20.208
Like, at all.

27:20.292 --> 27:21.583
She's really mad.

27:38.125 --> 27:39.208
Yeah, baby.

28:02.167 --> 28:03.167
Thor.

28:05.250 --> 28:09.083
Oh, hello, Mother. Good to see you.
Welcome to our study group.

28:09.167 --> 28:11.000
Uh...

28:11.083 --> 28:13.000
Everyone say hello to Mother.

28:13.083 --> 28:14.708
Hello, Mother Frigga.

28:14.792 --> 28:17.500
And to end our studies,
what do we always say, class?

28:17.583 --> 28:19.500
Learning is magic.

28:20.792 --> 28:24.375
See? I told you I was on an educational
and cultural exchange.

28:24.458 --> 28:27.542
Did you know that Midgard
is the birthplace of the Snuggie?

28:29.875 --> 28:32.083
Mother, you doubt?

28:34.125 --> 28:36.375
But look at all this learning, huh?

28:43.625 --> 28:46.875
Thor, here's the information
you requested on human civilizations.

28:46.958 --> 28:50.875
And I loaded a few documentaries,
PBS specials, NPR podcasts.

28:50.958 --> 28:52.625
I'll call you next week to discuss it.

28:52.708 --> 28:58.292
So tiny yet contains so, so much.
Thank you.

28:58.375 --> 29:00.500
You must be Frigga. I'm Captain Marvel.

29:00.583 --> 29:05.292
I know who you are.
Thank you for helping educate my son.

29:05.375 --> 29:07.000
-Let's go, darling.
-Wait.

29:07.083 --> 29:09.167
Almost forgot.

29:12.292 --> 29:14.042
Uh...

29:14.125 --> 29:15.458
Mother, I can explain.

29:25.125 --> 29:26.792
-Hi.
-Thanks.

29:26.875 --> 29:28.500
You called my mother on me.

29:28.583 --> 29:30.167
That wasn't a cool thing to do,

29:30.250 --> 29:33.083
but it was the right thing. So, thank you.

29:34.667 --> 29:35.917
You're welcome.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.417
I'll call you? Cools?

29:38.500 --> 29:40.458
No, it is not "cools."

29:40.542 --> 29:41.750
No?

29:41.833 --> 29:44.792
But I thought we had something.
I really like you, Jane.

29:44.875 --> 29:47.958
And not just because you're a genius.
You're also very attractive and...

29:48.542 --> 29:50.208
Well, then, ask me out on a date.

29:50.292 --> 29:51.708
Oh.

29:51.792 --> 29:55.625
Jane Foster, it would be my honor
to take you on a date.

29:55.708 --> 30:00.792
Before you answer, let me say that
I know a whole planet full of unicorns.

30:00.875 --> 30:02.542
Even the waiters are unicorns...

30:02.625 --> 30:05.417
-It's wonderful.
-Sounds delightful. Pick me up at00?

30:16.333 --> 30:19.750
A world restored,
love blossoming.

30:19.833 --> 30:24.000
As children,
both human and Asgardian, say,

30:24.083 --> 30:27.917
together, they lived happily ever after.

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
Wait, what?

30:30.083 --> 30:31.083
Huh?

30:35.375 --> 30:39.708
Oh, dear.
Perhaps I spoke too soon.
