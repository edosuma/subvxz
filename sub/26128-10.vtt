WEBVTT

00:01.252 --> 00:02.753
Oh, it's-it's you again.

00:02.837 --> 00:05.214
Okay, here's-here's what--
here's what happened.

00:05.297 --> 00:07.049
Carrie put on
this brown wig

00:07.133 --> 00:09.010
and was running out
into traffic,

00:09.093 --> 00:12.054
and the guy I thought
was the bad guy isn't,

00:12.138 --> 00:14.557
and her boyfriend
is the suicide bomber.

00:14.640 --> 00:16.726
You believe that shit?

00:16.809 --> 00:18.936
- Wrong show, Frank.
- What?

00:19.020 --> 00:21.230
That's <i>Homeland,</i>
not <i>Shameless.</i>

00:21.313 --> 00:22.690
Oh.

00:23.274 --> 00:24.650
Fuck.

00:24.734 --> 00:25.985
Wow.

00:26.694 --> 00:28.946
Don't mix Percocet
with beer.

00:30.322 --> 00:32.450
- Who's the new barback?
- That's Santiago.

00:32.533 --> 00:34.326
He's staying with us
until we find his father.

00:34.410 --> 00:36.370
They were gonna go live
with his uncle in Indiana.

00:36.454 --> 00:39.206
How are we gonna find
some random Guatemalan guy

00:39.290 --> 00:40.291
in Gary, Indiana?

00:40.374 --> 00:42.001
I did a web search:
"Where to find

00:42.084 --> 00:44.003
illegal immigrants,
Gary, Indiana."

00:44.086 --> 00:45.504
<i>Got a whole list of places.</i>

00:45.588 --> 00:47.173
You find
Santiago's uncle?

00:47.256 --> 00:49.175
Oh, yeah. Found him
and then lost him.

00:49.258 --> 00:50.801
Fly, my Mexican friend!

00:50.885 --> 00:53.596
- Guatemalan.
- Guatemalan friend!

00:53.679 --> 00:54.805
Fly!

00:54.889 --> 00:57.641
Liam, your share
of the bills this month: $70.

00:57.725 --> 00:59.518
- I'm nine.
- Figure it out.

00:59.602 --> 01:02.354
Carl, your share of the bill
this month is 70 bucks.

01:02.438 --> 01:03.856
Maybe you should get
a real job

01:03.939 --> 01:05.524
and stop hanging out
with your girlfriend so much.

01:05.608 --> 01:07.109
Ingrid and I are pregnant.

01:07.193 --> 01:08.861
- Triplets?
- Sextuplets.

01:08.944 --> 01:10.529
And we're hiding
from a North Korean

01:10.613 --> 01:13.115
fertility specialist,
so make room.

01:13.199 --> 01:14.533
We are moving in.

01:14.617 --> 01:15.910
Oh, that's hysterical.

01:15.993 --> 01:17.828
Do you really think
we can afford more than one?

01:17.912 --> 01:19.038
You'll get a job.

01:21.082 --> 01:22.583
"Dreams dead?
You're our man.

01:22.666 --> 01:24.835
Be the Hobo Loco Man."
Kev, what is this?

01:24.919 --> 01:26.337
They're holding a competition

01:26.420 --> 01:29.632
to choose the Hobo Loco
spokesperson.

01:29.715 --> 01:32.259
The winner gets
a $50,000 contract

01:32.343 --> 01:35.387
to be in a social media
campaign.

01:35.471 --> 01:37.098
This is me.

01:37.181 --> 01:39.183
I'm the Hobo Loco Man.

01:39.266 --> 01:41.102
You smell like a barroom floor.

01:42.853 --> 01:45.773
I don't need
anything from you!

01:45.856 --> 01:46.899
She do this a lot?

01:46.982 --> 01:48.150
Yeah.

04:20.803 --> 04:21.720

04:26.016 --> 04:27.893
How about this booth
right over here?

04:36.610 --> 04:38.445
Got any more
where this came from?

04:40.823 --> 04:44.368
Couple hours after last call,
but get you some coffee.

04:44.451 --> 04:46.495
So you're just drinking
on the job, then?

04:47.955 --> 04:49.957
Everything okay
out here, Fiona?

04:59.758 --> 05:01.343
Let's get out of here.

05:15.733 --> 05:16.817
Shit.

05:20.612 --> 05:22.489
Shit.
Shit.

05:22.573 --> 05:24.199
Shit.

05:24.283 --> 05:25.451
You all right?

05:27.703 --> 05:28.829
Yeah.

05:30.789 --> 05:31.999
Good.

05:50.642 --> 05:52.186
Nothing but junk mail.

05:53.979 --> 05:55.898
Rat shit in the attic.

05:55.981 --> 05:57.524
Fires in the dryer vent.

05:57.608 --> 05:59.234
These ads are terrifying.

05:59.318 --> 06:01.362
Carbon monoxide leaks
from the furnace?

06:01.445 --> 06:03.280
Fiona always handled
this shit.

06:03.364 --> 06:04.907
Should I be worried
about these things?

06:04.990 --> 06:07.493
Ah, homeowner stuff.

06:07.576 --> 06:09.870
Sucks to be an adult.

06:17.461 --> 06:19.880
What?
I'm eating for seven now.

06:19.963 --> 06:21.507
Well, then all seven of you
are gonna need

06:21.590 --> 06:23.634
to cough up cash
if you're gonna be living here.

06:23.717 --> 06:24.760
All right.

06:24.843 --> 06:26.053
I'm gonna do
some therapy sessions

06:26.136 --> 06:27.805
on the phone
this afternoon.

06:27.888 --> 06:29.598
I'll write you a check later.

06:31.517 --> 06:33.102
Hey.
Where you guys going?

06:33.185 --> 06:34.353
Softball camp.

06:34.436 --> 06:37.606
I got a call from one of those
20 jobs I applied for.

06:37.689 --> 06:39.149
Nice.
Which one?

06:39.233 --> 06:40.901
Some seafood
restaurant place.

06:40.984 --> 06:43.153
Carl Gallagher's
going legit.

06:43.237 --> 06:44.571
Minimum wage?

06:44.655 --> 06:45.948
Only job someone like me
can get.

06:46.031 --> 06:47.533
You know, you really
can't put "drug dealer"

06:47.616 --> 06:49.660
or "gunrunner"
on your West Point app.

06:49.743 --> 06:51.078
Come on, babe.

06:52.121 --> 06:53.455
Can we call
the plumber guy?

06:53.539 --> 06:55.332
Says he can snake our tub
for ten bucks.

06:55.416 --> 06:56.542
What's wrong with our tub?

06:56.625 --> 06:58.335
It has two inches
of scummy water in it

06:58.419 --> 07:00.421
all the time
that doesn't drain.

07:00.504 --> 07:02.589
Good morning, family one.

07:02.673 --> 07:03.674
Family two.

07:03.757 --> 07:05.300
Why do you look
like a farm animal?

07:05.384 --> 07:06.844
Smell like one too.

07:06.927 --> 07:09.847
Your father is gonna be
the new Hobo Loco

07:09.930 --> 07:11.765
beverage spokesperson.

07:11.849 --> 07:14.685
Now, I haven't won
the competition yet, Ingy.

07:15.352 --> 07:16.979
Hobo what-o?

07:17.062 --> 07:19.440
It's a delicious
alcoholic beverage.

07:19.523 --> 07:20.899
They're looking for someone

07:20.983 --> 07:22.651
with no purpose in life.

07:22.734 --> 07:24.695
I finally found my calling.

07:24.778 --> 07:28.490
Soon I'll be able
to support those I love.

07:29.366 --> 07:30.492
Oh, yeah.

07:34.079 --> 07:35.414
Wish me luck.

07:35.497 --> 07:38.750
Oh, you go get 'em,
my Hobo Loco tiger.

07:39.460 --> 07:41.920
Good-bye, little Frank-ettes.

07:48.051 --> 07:50.012
No need to even hold
a competition.

07:50.095 --> 07:51.180
If it involves alcohol,

07:51.263 --> 07:53.140
they should just
give him the prize.

07:54.349 --> 07:56.977
Think we need to worry
about termites?

08:01.773 --> 08:03.275
The hell's going on?

08:03.358 --> 08:05.444
Jesus, it's almost 7:30.

08:05.527 --> 08:06.904
Place is closed.

08:06.987 --> 08:08.739
W-well, where's Fiona?

08:08.822 --> 08:10.782
We already turned away
a bunch of customers.

08:10.866 --> 08:12.075
Well, let's get set up fast

08:12.159 --> 08:13.827
so we don't lose
any more business.

08:14.745 --> 08:15.996
Okay, let's get
the coffee going.

08:16.079 --> 08:17.080
Fire up the grills.

08:17.164 --> 08:18.499
Make sure the ketchups
are married.

08:18.582 --> 08:19.583
I'll get the blinds.

08:21.418 --> 08:22.419
All right,
set the tables.

08:22.503 --> 08:23.795
Let's go, guys.
Come on.

08:29.551 --> 08:31.094
Hey, Eliza.

08:34.181 --> 08:36.350
She alive?

08:36.808 --> 08:37.893
Yo, wakey-wakey!

08:37.976 --> 08:39.228
- Get the fuck away from me!
- Whoa, whoa!

08:39.311 --> 08:40.521
Take it easy!

08:40.604 --> 08:42.523
Shit.

08:42.606 --> 08:43.982
Sorry.

08:44.066 --> 08:45.400
You okay?

08:45.484 --> 08:48.070
Yeah.
Uh, what time is it?

08:48.153 --> 08:49.905
Why was this place locked?

08:51.657 --> 08:54.368
Oh, uh...

08:54.451 --> 08:57.246
I was doing the cash
out late,

08:57.329 --> 08:58.956
and I, uh, went
into the back office

08:59.039 --> 09:01.041
for a second,
and these...

09:01.124 --> 09:03.293
three sketchy guys
just came out of nowhere,

09:03.377 --> 09:04.878
and I thought they were
gonna rob me

09:04.962 --> 09:06.838
or...I don't know what.

09:06.922 --> 09:09.049
My God.
Are you okay?

09:09.132 --> 09:10.133
I-I locked up.
I didn't know

09:10.217 --> 09:11.343
if they were still
hanging around,

09:11.426 --> 09:13.136
and I didn't want to go home
or take the L that late

09:13.220 --> 09:15.097
in case they tried
to follow me.

09:17.140 --> 09:19.518
You left the cash out when
you went in the back office?

09:21.144 --> 09:22.187
Yeah, it's fine.

09:26.066 --> 09:27.067
All right.

09:27.150 --> 09:29.945
Um, I'm gonna go
and take a shower,

09:30.529 --> 09:33.740
and, uh, I will be back
for the lunch shift,

09:33.824 --> 09:35.450
and it won't happen again.

09:40.706 --> 09:42.499
See?
Shampoo.

09:42.583 --> 09:44.001
Not dish liquid.

09:44.543 --> 09:46.086
That's an interesting concept.

09:46.169 --> 09:47.254
Here, let me show you.

09:48.922 --> 09:50.424
All right.

09:54.761 --> 09:57.598
Oh, man.
Yeah, that, uh...

09:57.681 --> 09:59.725
that actually feels
really good.

09:59.808 --> 10:01.643
I give great head, huh?

10:01.727 --> 10:03.020
Yeah, it's better
than your regular head.

10:03.103 --> 10:04.354
- Hey!
- Knock, knock, knock!

10:04.438 --> 10:05.689
- Just me.
- Jesus, dude!

10:05.772 --> 10:06.773
And I'm not looking
at your dick.

10:06.857 --> 10:08.108
I just left my retainer
in here.

10:08.191 --> 10:09.526
Ew!

10:09.610 --> 10:11.194
I lied.
I looked at your dick. Bye!

10:11.278 --> 10:12.779
Hey, your stupid boyfriend
still owes me $300

10:12.863 --> 10:14.990
for the Comcast bill!

10:17.242 --> 10:18.619
You gotta lose those guys.

10:18.702 --> 10:19.995
Yeah, then I gotta go
through the bullshit

10:20.078 --> 10:21.288
of getting a new roommate.

10:22.039 --> 10:23.957
Okay, turn around.
Your turn.

10:24.875 --> 10:27.419
- All right.
- Are you off today?

10:27.919 --> 10:29.212
Yeah.

10:29.296 --> 10:30.297
Me too.

10:30.380 --> 10:31.381
Oh.

10:31.465 --> 10:33.425
We should do something.

10:33.508 --> 10:35.177
Why? You're not
hanging around with Boone?

10:35.260 --> 10:37.512
No, he's on his way
back to Yemen.

10:37.596 --> 10:39.306
Isn't that where
all those land mines are?

10:39.389 --> 10:40.932
Fingers crossed.

10:41.016 --> 10:43.268
So let's hang out.
Never done that before.

10:43.352 --> 10:45.854
We could see if we even
like each other.

10:45.937 --> 10:47.773
I got boring shit
to do all day.

10:47.856 --> 10:50.317
Me too.
We can do it together.

10:50.400 --> 10:53.320
Aah!
Turn around.

10:53.403 --> 10:55.113
- Take a look.
- Oh, nice.

10:55.197 --> 10:56.573
- It's good.
- Yeah, I like it.

10:56.657 --> 10:57.908
Right, you see,
I give good head too.

10:57.991 --> 11:00.869
What is this?

11:01.662 --> 11:05.457
<i>Diablas! Las diablas!</i>

11:05.540 --> 11:06.875
Santiago.

11:06.958 --> 11:08.877
He probably had
a nightmare again.

11:10.379 --> 11:11.463
- Ow!
- Die! Die!

11:14.424 --> 11:16.051
Girls!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:16.134 --> 11:19.179
- Stop. What are you doing?
- Hey! You're hurting him!

11:19.262 --> 11:21.682
- You duct taped him?
- And handcuffs?

11:21.765 --> 11:23.141
Santiago, I am so sorry.

11:23.225 --> 11:24.768
You have to forgive them.

11:24.851 --> 11:26.728
The-the girls
are a little bit wild.

11:26.812 --> 11:29.398
Preschool was supposed
to be taming them.

11:29.481 --> 11:31.692
Come on, baby.
Let's go get you some juice.

11:32.901 --> 11:35.654
Girls, what has gotten
into you?

11:35.737 --> 11:38.281
- We don't hurt people.
- We don't?

11:38.365 --> 11:40.492
No, of course not.
We have to be nice,

11:40.575 --> 11:42.327
and Santiago's
part of our family.

11:42.411 --> 11:44.579
- No.
- Yes, honey,

11:44.663 --> 11:46.665
and his sister's
gonna be here soon too.

11:46.748 --> 11:48.375
No, they go home.

11:48.458 --> 11:50.168
They don't have a home.

11:50.836 --> 11:53.088
Bad people wanted
to turn them into sex slaves

11:53.171 --> 11:54.297
and gang members.

11:54.381 --> 11:55.882
Kev, please stop talking.

11:55.966 --> 11:57.217
I'm trying to teach them.
I'm--

11:57.300 --> 11:58.677
They're four years old.
Come on, girls.

11:58.760 --> 11:59.970
It's time to get dressed
for school.

12:00.053 --> 12:01.555
Take Santiago to the bar.

12:04.141 --> 12:05.559
Santiago.

12:05.642 --> 12:07.060
What do you say?

12:07.144 --> 12:09.396
Me and you having some
quality dad time together?

12:09.479 --> 12:10.564
Huh?
Let's do it!

12:10.647 --> 12:12.190
No, no.

12:12.274 --> 12:13.942
God, I'm so sorry.

12:16.778 --> 12:18.155
Yeah, just hold up the shirt.

12:18.613 --> 12:20.407
Nice!

12:21.283 --> 12:23.827
Hey, Hobo Loco is trending
in the top 50 right now.

12:23.910 --> 12:25.495
Thought we'd have, like,
30 homeless here

12:25.579 --> 12:26.580
and that'd be it.

12:26.663 --> 12:29.291
Hey, everyone!

12:29.374 --> 12:31.501
Let me all hear you say,

12:31.585 --> 12:33.837
"I love Hobo Loco!"

12:33.920 --> 12:36.840
I love Hobo Loco!

12:42.554 --> 12:44.222
Are you fucking kidding me?

12:44.306 --> 12:45.932
Who are all these people?

12:46.016 --> 12:47.809
Jesus.

12:47.893 --> 12:52.105
Hey, is everybody here
for the Hobo Loco competition?

12:52.189 --> 12:54.733
Apparently so,
but I'm gonna win this thing.

12:56.234 --> 12:59.029
Gonna be hard,
since I'm a shoo-in.

12:59.112 --> 13:00.447
That right?

13:00.530 --> 13:03.492
I've never held the same job
for more than 37 days.

13:03.575 --> 13:06.119
I spent my life savings
on a Blockbuster franchise

13:06.203 --> 13:07.746
in 2013.

13:08.955 --> 13:12.209
I buried a bipolar wife,
a cancer-riddled girlfriend,

13:12.292 --> 13:14.169
and a mother
who never loved me.

13:14.252 --> 13:16.129
Two-thirds of my penis
got blown off

13:16.213 --> 13:18.131
in the First Gulf War.

13:18.673 --> 13:20.592
I won the lottery in 2006

13:20.675 --> 13:22.677
and accidentally used
the winning ticket

13:22.761 --> 13:24.429
as a rolling paper.

13:24.971 --> 13:27.015
I grew up in Flint, Michigan.

13:31.353 --> 13:32.354
Frank Gallagher.

13:32.437 --> 13:33.939
Mikey O'Shea.

13:35.148 --> 13:37.067
Irish, huh?

13:37.150 --> 13:39.820
Well, the dead junkie
whose wallet I acquired was.

13:40.654 --> 13:42.239
Very impressive.

13:43.323 --> 13:44.533
Why do these fucking posers

13:44.616 --> 13:47.077
think they can steal
our thunder?

13:47.160 --> 13:48.537
Because their parents
told them

13:48.620 --> 13:50.455
they could be anything
they wanted to be.

13:52.958 --> 13:54.334
Let's teach 'em a lesson.

13:54.417 --> 13:55.418
Let's kick ass.

13:55.502 --> 13:56.670
Excuse us.
Excuse us.

13:56.753 --> 13:57.754
- Excuse me!
- Excuse us.

13:57.838 --> 13:58.839
- VIP!
- Coming through.

13:58.922 --> 14:00.298
Coming through. This way.
One second.

14:00.382 --> 14:01.383
Look out. Oh, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey.

14:01.466 --> 14:03.260
Let the real hobos through!

14:03.343 --> 14:04.845
Don't be rude.
Don't be rude.

14:04.928 --> 14:06.137
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!
- Come on, excuse us.

14:06.221 --> 14:08.265
- Hey! Hey, hey, hey.
- Good God.

14:08.348 --> 14:10.016
We're here
for the competition.

14:10.100 --> 14:12.352
- Where do we sign?
- They cut the line!

14:12.435 --> 14:14.020
And that's exactly

14:14.104 --> 14:15.689
the kind of spunk
we're looking for.

14:15.772 --> 14:17.148
Do you hear that,
Phi Piggie Piggie?

14:17.232 --> 14:18.567
That's what they're
looking for.

14:18.650 --> 14:21.111
Get your spunk-less ass
out of here!

14:21.194 --> 14:22.946
- You should learn.
- Hey, fellas.

14:23.029 --> 14:24.447
I just--I just need you
to sign in right here.

14:24.531 --> 14:25.615
Oh, right away.

14:25.699 --> 14:26.658
- Done.
- Again, yeah.

14:26.741 --> 14:28.034
Great.
Mm-hmm.

14:28.118 --> 14:29.452
Okay, next,
I'm gonna need to test

14:29.536 --> 14:31.580
your baseline
blood alcohol content.

14:31.663 --> 14:33.999
Right this way.

14:34.082 --> 14:35.959
Here we are.

14:43.675 --> 14:44.968
Point two-three.

14:45.051 --> 14:46.094
Nice.

14:47.220 --> 14:49.055
Point two-seven.

14:49.139 --> 14:50.515
Whoa.

14:50.599 --> 14:52.017
All in a day's work.

14:52.100 --> 14:53.935
Whoo.
Great job.

14:54.019 --> 14:55.395
Okay, now, over here,

14:55.478 --> 14:56.646
you're gonna need
to drink two ounces

14:56.730 --> 14:59.482
of Hobo Loco
in less than 15 seconds,

14:59.566 --> 15:01.318
and please,
no throwing up on me.

15:01.401 --> 15:03.612
Please use the trash can
over here.

15:03.695 --> 15:07.741
Okay, and...

15:08.909 --> 15:10.785
OMG.
That was amazing.

15:10.869 --> 15:11.995
It's like drinking water.

15:12.078 --> 15:13.622
More like watered-down water.

15:13.705 --> 15:16.041
Well,
have a Hobo Loco hat.

15:16.124 --> 15:17.500
Agency will be announcing
the contestants

15:17.584 --> 15:18.752
in just a bit.

15:18.835 --> 15:19.836
All right, next.

15:21.546 --> 15:23.381
Good luck, J-holes.

15:23.465 --> 15:24.841
You hear that, douchebags?

15:27.385 --> 15:29.012
This is the dining area.

15:29.095 --> 15:30.972
I was really impressed
with your résumé.

15:31.056 --> 15:33.308
- Really?
- Kitchen.

15:33.391 --> 15:34.893
Yeah.

15:35.518 --> 15:36.937
Military man, hmm?

15:37.020 --> 15:38.396
Mmm-mmm.

15:38.480 --> 15:39.689
Um, okay.

15:39.773 --> 15:42.192
And this is
the employee lounge.

15:42.275 --> 15:45.111
Your uniform:
right in here.

15:45.195 --> 15:47.364
Let me know if you need
any help putting it on.

15:47.447 --> 15:48.448
Yeah.

15:48.531 --> 15:49.532
Hey, so what's the job?

15:49.616 --> 15:51.451
Busboy, uh, dishwasher?

15:51.534 --> 15:53.119

Careful.
Here.

16:47.507 --> 16:49.926
Hey.

16:52.971 --> 16:54.305
What's going on in here?

16:54.389 --> 16:57.142
Morning sickness.

16:57.225 --> 16:58.518
Snaking the tub.

16:58.601 --> 17:00.103
I got it.

17:01.312 --> 17:02.981
That's disgusting!

17:04.315 --> 17:05.817
- Damn.
- Oh.

17:05.900 --> 17:07.610
I should add "plumber"
to my welding résumé.

17:07.694 --> 17:09.654
All right, may I take
a shower, please?

17:09.738 --> 17:11.781
Yeah.

17:11.865 --> 17:14.701
Hey, do you ever do those things
in the saver special?

17:14.784 --> 17:16.870
Check for carbon monoxide leaks
or clean the dryer vent?

17:16.953 --> 17:19.497
No.
Too busy, you know,

17:19.581 --> 17:22.333
raising five kids and Frank.

17:22.417 --> 17:23.752
Well, make it quick
in there.

17:23.835 --> 17:25.253
Make sure you clean up
your hair in the drain after.

17:25.336 --> 17:26.504
Yeah, all right.

17:30.133 --> 17:32.010
Debs.

17:32.093 --> 17:34.262
Sorry I snapped at you.

17:34.345 --> 17:35.764
You're doing a good job.

17:35.847 --> 17:37.098
Thanks.

17:37.182 --> 17:38.349
Also, I'm working
the lunch shift later,

17:38.433 --> 17:40.185
so I'll have money
for you today.

17:40.268 --> 17:41.394
Good.

17:46.399 --> 17:49.652
Really helps
my morning sickness.

18:01.498 --> 18:04.793
So should we, like,
hold hands or something?

18:04.876 --> 18:07.045
I don't know.
Your hands get all sweaty?

18:07.128 --> 18:10.090
They will now
that you asked me like that.

18:10.173 --> 18:11.549
Are you a top
or bottom?

18:11.633 --> 18:13.009
- Bottom.
- Ah, see, me too.

18:13.093 --> 18:14.427
This will never work.

18:14.511 --> 18:16.137
It's all right.
We're here anyway.

18:17.639 --> 18:18.807
A nursing home?

18:18.890 --> 18:20.892
Yeah.
I volunteer here once a month.

18:20.975 --> 18:22.852
Come on,
you can help me.

18:22.936 --> 18:24.354
Shit.

18:24.437 --> 18:26.356
Hey, are we gonna
be cleaning bedpans or...

18:28.274 --> 18:29.776
What up, bitches?

18:29.859 --> 18:32.529
Tami, Audrey got
denture cream in my hair.

18:32.612 --> 18:33.738
Aww, let me see that.

18:33.822 --> 18:35.448
I did not do that.

18:35.532 --> 18:37.158
Tomorrow you'll say
you did do it.

18:37.242 --> 18:39.327
Make up
your Alzheimer's-y mind.

18:39.410 --> 18:41.788
All right, ladies.
Who's at the bowls first?

18:41.871 --> 18:44.457
I've got an assistant today,
so we can do two at a time.

18:44.541 --> 18:46.543
- Me.
- Me too.

18:46.626 --> 18:48.128
- What are we doing?
- Washing their hair.

18:48.211 --> 18:49.379
We're washing their hair?

18:49.462 --> 18:50.463
Yeah. Watch out for that one.

18:50.547 --> 18:51.881
She's handsy,
likes to grab a dick.

18:51.965 --> 18:54.175

Giving Santiago
more of an American look

19:38.052 --> 19:40.138
dropping her off
a little bit later.

19:40.221 --> 19:41.973
There you go.

19:44.225 --> 19:45.518
And the final touch.

19:46.769 --> 19:48.438
Huh?

19:48.521 --> 19:50.940
Oh.
Okay.

19:51.024 --> 19:52.734
How's he look?

19:52.817 --> 19:54.068
Like a cheesy American.

19:54.152 --> 19:55.737
Nice.

20:01.409 --> 20:03.620
So you got a lady friend
back home?

20:03.703 --> 20:05.455
Mm, sure do.

20:05.538 --> 20:07.540
Jasmine Dawn.

20:07.624 --> 20:09.959
Except she kicked me out
three years ago.

20:11.544 --> 20:13.504
Strapping young man like you?

20:13.588 --> 20:14.964
Yeah, well, I had
too many blackouts

20:15.048 --> 20:16.883
for her to deal with.

20:17.383 --> 20:19.219
But I become the Hobo Loco Man,
though,

20:19.302 --> 20:21.596
she gotta take me back,
right?

20:21.679 --> 20:23.765
As long as she'll settle
for runner-up.

20:23.848 --> 20:25.141
Won't have to.

20:25.225 --> 20:27.060
You got loser
written all over you.

20:27.769 --> 20:30.104
All right,
good afternoon!

20:30.188 --> 20:32.273

20:34.692 --> 20:37.111

of course.
Yes, ladies.

20:47.080 --> 20:49.207

20:49.290 --> 20:51.542
- There's Bethany!
- Hey, all right.

20:51.626 --> 20:52.835
Next up, Victor...

20:52.919 --> 20:55.296
"Nag-high."

20:55.380 --> 20:56.839

20:59.968 --> 21:01.511
Whoo! Yes!
Where is he?

21:01.594 --> 21:02.762
- Hey, there he is.
- That's Frank.

21:02.845 --> 21:04.180
There he is!

21:04.264 --> 21:07.642
All right.
Gloria Sweetland.

21:08.810 --> 21:10.436
Oh, she's got fans.

21:10.520 --> 21:12.105
Uh-oh.

21:12.188 --> 21:15.400
Mikey O'Shea!

21:15.483 --> 21:16.943
- Mikey, Mikey, Mikey.
- Yeah.

21:17.026 --> 21:19.279
Yay!

21:19.362 --> 21:20.738
We got a competition now.

21:20.822 --> 21:22.282
- Yeah.
<i>- Hola.</i>

21:22.365 --> 21:25.159
Next up,
Mrs. O'Coin.

21:25.243 --> 21:26.995
Right.
There she is.

21:32.292 --> 21:34.252
Oh, hey.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

21:34.335 --> 21:36.879
No means no, Audrey,
all right?

21:36.963 --> 21:38.423
There you go.

21:40.133 --> 21:41.217
So what boring stuff are you

21:41.301 --> 21:43.136
gonna have me do
with you today?

21:43.219 --> 21:46.180
Uh, gotta buy
a new phone charger,

21:46.264 --> 21:47.765
some socks,

21:47.849 --> 21:49.809
then go grocery shopping.

21:49.892 --> 21:51.227
Debs has us on rotation.

21:51.311 --> 21:52.812
It's my turn.

21:52.895 --> 21:54.897
I can help you get
some healthy stuff.

21:54.981 --> 21:57.317
Do you know they actually have
produce aisles

21:57.400 --> 21:58.735
at the grocery store?

21:58.818 --> 22:00.737
Hmm, you don't say.

22:02.697 --> 22:05.450
This feels so good.

22:05.533 --> 22:07.118
It's been a long time
since a boy's

22:07.201 --> 22:09.412
run his fingers
through my hair.

22:11.497 --> 22:13.499
Hey, uh, how long
you been volunteering here?

22:13.583 --> 22:15.168
Uh, since beauty school.

22:15.251 --> 22:17.211
My Grandma Peggy
used to live here.

22:17.295 --> 22:19.047
Hmm?
What'd you say?

22:19.130 --> 22:21.257
I wasn't talking to you,
Broom Hilda.

22:22.091 --> 22:23.926
I was telling Lip
about my Grandma Peggy.

22:24.469 --> 22:26.179
The whore?

22:26.262 --> 22:29.140
She fucked your boyfriend
one time. Get over it.

22:29.223 --> 22:30.892
You know, that shit shouldn't
matter once you're past 75.

22:30.975 --> 22:32.310
I will never forget.

22:32.393 --> 22:34.354
Okay, well, that's good.
You hold on to that.

22:34.437 --> 22:35.521
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

22:39.859 --> 22:41.986
You're smiling at me
in that way.

22:43.154 --> 22:44.489
What way?

22:44.572 --> 22:46.324
That you like me.

22:46.407 --> 22:48.159
Well, it's kind of hard not to
when you're

22:48.242 --> 22:49.911
putting rollers
in some lady's hair

22:49.994 --> 22:51.454
on your day off.

22:52.413 --> 22:54.082
- Oh, whoa.
- Audrey, stop.

22:54.165 --> 22:56.292
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Leave him alone.

22:56.376 --> 22:57.877
That's my dick.

23:13.643 --> 23:14.852
'Sup, small fry?

23:14.936 --> 23:16.270
Saw the sign in the window.

23:16.354 --> 23:18.231
"Help Wanted."
I need a job.

23:18.314 --> 23:19.482
How old are you?

23:19.565 --> 23:20.441
Twenty-five.

23:21.859 --> 23:23.611
Yeah, come back
when you're 31.

23:24.445 --> 23:25.446
Okay.

23:28.449 --> 23:30.910
What do you do with those
squeezed-out lemons?

23:30.993 --> 23:31.994
<i>Whoo!</i>

23:38.876 --> 23:41.546
Okay, congratulations,
hobos.

23:41.629 --> 23:42.713
For the next week,
you'll be sleeping

23:42.797 --> 23:44.924
in this backyard
and be required to drink

23:45.007 --> 23:47.802
16 ounces of Hobo Loco daily.

23:47.885 --> 23:49.929
Each day, you'll be given
timed challenges.

23:50.012 --> 23:52.014
Those of you who fail
to complete the tasks

23:52.098 --> 23:53.599
will be eliminated.

23:53.683 --> 23:56.102
You'll also need
to create brand awareness.

23:56.185 --> 23:59.480
You each get a phone
and two quarts of Hobo Loco.

23:59.564 --> 24:01.691
Take lots
of photos and videos

24:01.774 --> 24:03.818
of folks sampling
your Hobo Loco.

24:03.901 --> 24:05.778
All right, who's ready
for the first challenge?

24:05.862 --> 24:07.864
- Yeah!
- Yay.

24:07.947 --> 24:10.366
In the spirit of a true hobo,
each contestant will forage

24:10.450 --> 24:13.077
for their own bedding
to sleep on tonight.

24:13.161 --> 24:14.745
You will be judged

24:14.829 --> 24:17.748
on creativity
and resourcefulness.

24:17.832 --> 24:20.626
You have one hour.

24:20.710 --> 24:22.879
All right, let's go out there,
start hobo-ing!

24:22.962 --> 24:24.172
Okay!

24:24.255 --> 24:25.631
- Frank!
- What are you doing?

24:25.715 --> 24:26.924
- Come on, Frank!
- Get off of me. No!

24:27.008 --> 24:28.843
Wait for me!

24:28.926 --> 24:30.303
Argh, matey.

24:30.386 --> 24:32.805
Popcorn shrimp is back.

24:34.015 --> 24:35.516
Fucking sh--

24:36.767 --> 24:39.187
Aye, aye, matey.
Popcorn shrimp is back.

24:39.270 --> 24:42.148
Hey, butt pirate,
need a soda with your shrimp?

24:42.231 --> 24:43.608
Fuck you, douchebag!

24:45.151 --> 24:47.612
Fuck.

24:47.695 --> 24:49.655
Aye, aye, matey.

24:49.739 --> 24:52.492
Popcorn shrimp.
Fuck.

24:53.576 --> 24:55.620
When did we plant grass
in here?

24:55.703 --> 24:58.289
- That's mold.
- Ah, fuck.

24:58.372 --> 25:00.208
When'd you guys
suddenly get into cleaning?

25:00.291 --> 25:01.959
Makes Santiago happy.

25:02.043 --> 25:03.920
Yeah, we're doing stuff
he likes.

25:05.379 --> 25:07.131
Hey, uh, Santiago said

25:07.215 --> 25:09.383
your girls are trying
to murder him.

25:09.467 --> 25:10.593
What?

25:10.676 --> 25:12.053
Is that what they were doing
this morning?

25:12.136 --> 25:13.804
Wait, that's what they
were doing this morning?

25:13.888 --> 25:15.264
He called them
<i>las diablas--</i>

25:15.348 --> 25:17.225
the devils.

25:17.308 --> 25:18.643
But he's okay with it,
because he doesn't want you

25:18.726 --> 25:19.769
to send him back.

25:19.852 --> 25:21.354
We're not gonna
send him back.

25:21.437 --> 25:22.813
Why would the girls
want to murder him?

25:22.897 --> 25:24.315
They're not trying
to murder anyone.

25:24.398 --> 25:26.400
- They're just playing.
- Maybe they're jealous--

25:26.484 --> 25:27.944
sibling rivalry.

25:28.027 --> 25:29.237
Maybe they're
just not into having

25:29.320 --> 25:30.863
some random brown dude
who doesn't speak English

25:30.947 --> 25:31.948
living in their house.

25:32.031 --> 25:32.823
They're brown too.

25:32.907 --> 25:34.158
Different shade of brown.

25:34.242 --> 25:35.660
Oh, that's crazy.

25:35.743 --> 25:37.870
Just as crazy as white people,
who are actually pink,

25:37.954 --> 25:39.830
thinking all black people
are the same color.

25:39.914 --> 25:41.499
Well, what about
brownish white people,

25:41.582 --> 25:43.209
like some Italians

25:43.292 --> 25:45.336
or Portuguese or Spanish?

25:45.419 --> 25:47.046
They can be
as brown as Santiago.

25:47.129 --> 25:48.548
They're European brown.

25:48.631 --> 25:50.258
All right, I'm lost.
What are you talking about?

25:50.341 --> 25:51.842
Okay, it's real simple.
Your girls

25:51.926 --> 25:53.511
are a different brown
than Santiago,

25:53.594 --> 25:54.971
so they want
his different brown

25:55.054 --> 25:56.514
to go home where he belongs

25:56.597 --> 25:57.640
and leave their brown to get

25:57.723 --> 25:59.392
all the good stuff
from America.

25:59.475 --> 26:00.685
Are you saying our girls
are racist?

26:00.768 --> 26:02.186
He's saying Amy and Gemma

26:02.270 --> 26:04.522
don't understand
what's going on.

26:04.605 --> 26:05.815
What if they want
to murder Martina

26:05.898 --> 26:07.024
when she shows up?

26:07.108 --> 26:08.484
No one's murdering anyone.

26:08.568 --> 26:10.653
- Who's Martina?
- Santiago's sister.

26:10.736 --> 26:12.405
If she's the same color brown
as him,

26:12.488 --> 26:13.656
they're gonna want
to murder her.

26:13.739 --> 26:15.408
Oh, shut up, Tommy.
It'd like Kermit said.

26:15.491 --> 26:16.784
They're just jealous.

26:16.867 --> 26:18.244
We're gonna talk to them
after school

26:18.327 --> 26:19.412
and tell them there's plenty
of good stuff in America

26:19.495 --> 26:20.663
for all the brown people

26:20.746 --> 26:21.998
so they don't have
to end up in jail

26:22.081 --> 26:23.791
for murdering
the different brown people

26:23.874 --> 26:24.959
or something like that, right?

26:30.089 --> 26:31.799
Hey, I recognize you.

26:31.882 --> 26:33.509
You're that crazy lady's
ex-husband.

26:33.593 --> 26:36.095
- Yeah. Is she here?
- Gallaghers don't snitch.

26:36.178 --> 26:38.264
I got a phone app
that says she's in there.

26:38.347 --> 26:40.474
Oh, okay.

26:40.558 --> 26:42.435
Make yourself useful
and get the door.

26:42.518 --> 26:44.895
All right.

26:44.979 --> 26:46.981
There you go.

26:49.191 --> 26:50.568
Cool if I look around?

26:50.651 --> 26:52.028
Knock yourself out.

26:52.111 --> 26:53.487
Might be upstairs.

26:55.489 --> 26:57.116
- Ingrid?
- You fall?

26:57.199 --> 26:58.284
- No.
- Ingrid!

26:58.367 --> 27:00.161
Just making sure
my embryos stay in.

27:00.244 --> 27:01.370
Where are you?

27:01.454 --> 27:02.830
I'm selling lemonade
to make money

27:02.913 --> 27:04.373
so I can sleep indoors again.

27:04.457 --> 27:05.458
Ingrid?

27:05.541 --> 27:06.709
What the hell
are you doing?

27:06.792 --> 27:07.793
Vacuuming the lint

27:07.877 --> 27:09.795
out of the dryer vents
before they catch on fire.

27:09.879 --> 27:11.505
Ingrid, where--

27:11.589 --> 27:13.132
Ingrid.

27:13.215 --> 27:15.051
Ingy.

27:15.134 --> 27:16.135
What are you doing here?

27:16.218 --> 27:17.219
Dr. Kwan called me.

27:17.303 --> 27:18.471
She told me you were pregnant.

27:18.554 --> 27:19.972
That's wonderful.

27:20.056 --> 27:21.766
Wonderful?

27:21.849 --> 27:23.768
You never wanted me
to have children

27:23.851 --> 27:25.269
because of my condition.

27:25.353 --> 27:27.104
Well, now
that you are pregnant,

27:27.188 --> 27:28.564
it's a beautiful miracle.

27:28.648 --> 27:30.024
Let's do this together.

27:30.107 --> 27:31.317
What?

27:31.400 --> 27:32.902
They're not even yours.

27:32.985 --> 27:34.111
They're Frank's.

27:35.029 --> 27:36.906
Yes, but you just met him.

27:36.989 --> 27:39.033
You think he's really committed
to having more kids?

27:39.116 --> 27:40.951
Yes.
Yes.

27:41.035 --> 27:42.995
But I'm the one who's always
been there for you,

27:43.079 --> 27:44.413
and I always will,

27:44.497 --> 27:46.624
so let's get you
back on your meds

27:46.707 --> 27:48.918
and then we'll go
for a checkup with Dr. Kwan.

27:49.710 --> 27:51.212
You're trying to trick me.

27:52.088 --> 27:53.714
You're gonna get me
on that exam table

27:53.798 --> 27:56.676
and then have Kwan just suck
the embryos out of me!

27:56.759 --> 27:58.969
No, I won't.
I won't, I promise.

27:59.053 --> 28:01.222
We'll keep two.
We'll have twins.

28:01.305 --> 28:02.390
Wouldn't that be great?
Twins?

28:02.473 --> 28:04.433
Bullshit.

28:04.517 --> 28:06.227
You don't want my babies.

28:06.310 --> 28:08.854
Frank does.
Frank loves me.

28:08.938 --> 28:12.358
He loves all six
of my embryos.

28:12.817 --> 28:15.027
I have a phone patient now,

28:15.111 --> 28:17.071
so please go.

28:18.739 --> 28:20.866
Okay, okay.

28:23.119 --> 28:25.413
I'll check back in later.

28:31.961 --> 28:33.087
Hey, Debbie.

28:35.506 --> 28:37.174
Randy's wrong.

28:37.258 --> 28:39.885
Frank'll be committed
to my six babies, right?

28:39.969 --> 28:41.804
Not a chance.

28:51.439 --> 28:53.899
What are you on my ass for?

28:53.983 --> 28:56.152
Find your own bedding.
This is my spot.

28:56.235 --> 28:58.154
I thought we could make a pact.

28:58.237 --> 28:59.780
Either one of us wins,

28:59.864 --> 29:02.408
we split the spokesman money,
50/50.

29:02.491 --> 29:05.578
You trying to hone in
on my dough?

29:06.036 --> 29:08.414
Or am I trying to give you
half of mine, hmm?

29:10.249 --> 29:12.918
You're a crafty dude,
Mikey O.

29:14.712 --> 29:17.423
I'm a lone wolf.
Go.

29:18.382 --> 29:19.967
Suit yourself.

29:20.050 --> 29:21.510
- Suit yourself.
- Go!

Hey, I've bought
green things before.

30:06.972 --> 30:09.558

30:14.772 --> 30:16.440
Yeah, I can go on.
Shamrock shakes.

Green eggs and ham.

I'm just working

Xan, where's your mom?

Don't know.

I'll make you something to eat.

31:43.944 --> 31:46.488
W-when's the last time
you saw her?

31:46.572 --> 31:48.198
She went to get pizza.

31:48.282 --> 31:50.159
I waited in the motel.

31:50.743 --> 31:52.244
Watched TV and stuff.

31:52.328 --> 31:53.412
What, and she never came back?

Motel guy kicked me out.

32:07.968 --> 32:09.136
Couple days ago.

32:10.054 --> 32:11.972
Where have you been
since then, Xan?

32:13.140 --> 32:15.351
Sometimes my mom works
at this truck stop.

32:15.434 --> 32:17.019
I just hung out there.

- No, I'm not gonna chill

32:29.365 --> 32:31.825
Okay, well,

32:32.701 --> 32:34.203
I'll give her a bath.
I'll talk to her.

32:34.286 --> 32:35.996

34:22.478 --> 34:23.729
What brings you here?

34:23.812 --> 34:26.315
Police got a 911 call
last night

34:26.398 --> 34:28.484
about a possible robbery.

34:30.235 --> 34:32.112
A frantic woman called,
saying that three men

34:32.196 --> 34:33.655
were threatening her,

34:33.739 --> 34:35.783
and she said they left
but she was afraid

34:35.866 --> 34:38.118
they were gonna come back.

34:38.202 --> 34:41.538
And when the police arrived,
the restaurant was closed,

34:41.622 --> 34:45.125
which is interesting,
since we're open 24 hours.

34:45.209 --> 34:46.710
Maybe they had
the wrong address.

34:46.794 --> 34:47.878

or angry on the job.

37:26.370 --> 37:27.996

37:28.080 --> 37:30.290
Why?
Santiago's a good guy.

37:30.374 --> 37:31.375
He leaves now?

37:31.458 --> 37:33.168
No, baby, he doesn't leave now.

37:33.252 --> 37:34.503
He's staying here with us.

37:34.586 --> 37:36.797
He's our family.

37:39.967 --> 37:41.260
Oh, fuck.

37:41.343 --> 37:43.512
Girls, is this
because Santiago's

37:43.595 --> 37:46.014
a different shade of brown
than you?

37:46.098 --> 37:49.184
Or, girls, is this because
you're jealous of Santiago?

37:49.893 --> 37:50.894
We need to treat people

37:50.978 --> 37:52.312
how we want
to be treated.

37:52.396 --> 37:53.814
There are people in this world

37:53.897 --> 37:56.566
who want to send brown people
like us back to Africa,

37:56.650 --> 37:58.277
but we won't stand for it,
will we?

37:58.360 --> 38:00.821
No.
So we also won't stand

38:00.904 --> 38:03.073
for them wanting to send
other kinds of brown people

38:03.156 --> 38:04.866
back to Central America.

38:04.950 --> 38:05.993

38:07.411 --> 38:10.247

Uh, snookums,

38:10.330 --> 38:12.124
I used to have
sibling rivalry

38:12.207 --> 38:14.543
with the kids
in my foster homes, okay?

38:14.626 --> 38:16.878
Especially this one boy,
Joey Caccitore.

38:16.962 --> 38:18.755
He used to kiss up
to my foster parents

38:18.839 --> 38:20.632
all the time,
and they would give him

38:20.716 --> 38:22.259
extra butterscotch pudding,

38:22.884 --> 38:24.886
and I thought
that they loved him more,

38:24.970 --> 38:26.305
but in reality,

38:26.388 --> 38:28.432
they just hated all of us.

38:28.515 --> 38:30.559
- Kev, how is that helping?
- I don't know.

38:30.642 --> 38:32.311
I forget that's how
the story ended.

38:32.394 --> 38:34.187
I'll get it.

38:34.271 --> 38:35.355
Talk about
the brown people more.

38:35.439 --> 38:36.773
I think that was helping.

38:37.316 --> 38:39.860
Just because Santiago's here
doesn't mean we love you less,

38:39.943 --> 38:41.486
and just because he's different

38:41.570 --> 38:43.071
doesn't mean that
we're gonna get rid of him.

38:43.155 --> 38:44.364
- V.
- Yeah?

38:44.448 --> 38:46.616
- Look who it is.
- Hi.

39:59.940 --> 40:02.401
dumpster diving
for your dinner.

40:02.484 --> 40:04.903
Who thinks they can bring back
the best meal?

40:04.986 --> 40:06.405
- I can!
- Well, let's see!

40:06.488 --> 40:08.156
Whoo! Go! Go! Go!

40:08.240 --> 40:10.033
- Whoo!
- One hour! Let's go!

40:10.117 --> 40:12.202
Don't forget to share
your Hobo Loco

40:12.285 --> 40:13.995
on social media!

40:16.289 --> 40:17.582
We're gonna make
the American hobo

40:17.666 --> 40:19.835
as famous as Joe Camel.

40:41.314 --> 40:42.983
You did good, coming here.

40:43.775 --> 40:45.444
You know, Lip's a smart guy.

40:46.111 --> 40:47.863
I like him.

40:47.946 --> 40:49.990
He'll figure this out.

40:50.949 --> 40:52.200
Yeah.

40:52.284 --> 40:54.619
But you can't be hanging out
at truck stops, right?

40:54.703 --> 40:56.663
It's a lot of creepy people
out there.

40:58.290 --> 41:00.542
Look, if I saw--

41:00.625 --> 41:02.961
if I saw a little girl
on the street alone,

41:03.044 --> 41:05.088
I would want to protect her,

41:05.172 --> 41:06.756
make sure she was safe,

41:07.883 --> 41:09.134
but there are
some bad people out there

41:09.217 --> 41:11.011
who'd want to hurt her,

41:11.094 --> 41:12.929
maybe say stuff

41:13.013 --> 41:15.682
or do stuff to her.

41:15.765 --> 41:17.392
If that ever happened,

41:17.476 --> 41:19.060
you can tell me about it.

41:20.854 --> 41:23.648
Hey, I'd listen to anything
you have to say,

41:23.732 --> 41:25.442
try and make you feel better,

41:25.525 --> 41:27.819
or maybe even beat the shit
out of that person.

41:27.903 --> 41:29.196
I don't know.

41:32.199 --> 41:33.408
Come on.

41:33.492 --> 41:34.659
Let's go raid Lip's closet

41:34.743 --> 41:35.869
and find you
something clean to wear.

41:37.329 --> 41:38.914
No, Sally,
I didn't say

41:38.997 --> 41:41.458
that you were responsible
for Lou not remembering

41:41.541 --> 41:43.460
your birthday.

41:43.543 --> 41:45.378
I said you were responsible

41:45.462 --> 41:46.796
for the way you reacted

41:46.880 --> 41:48.632
to Lou not remembering
your birthday.

41:48.715 --> 41:51.384
Guess who just got
fucking fired!

41:52.886 --> 41:54.763
Are you shushing me
in my own house?

41:54.846 --> 41:56.139
She's doing
a phone therapy session

41:56.223 --> 41:57.474
with her client Sally.

41:57.557 --> 41:59.684
Oh.
Hey, Sally.

41:59.768 --> 42:02.938
Sally, I got all the therapy
you could ever need right here!

42:03.021 --> 42:04.523
- Sorry, Sally...
- What happened?

42:04.606 --> 42:05.941
Why'd you get fired?

42:06.024 --> 42:08.026
Bullshit this,
bullshit that,

42:08.109 --> 42:09.736
blah, blah, blah.

42:10.820 --> 42:12.113
So what's your plan now?

42:12.197 --> 42:13.949
Gonna hang around here,
drinking all day?

42:15.283 --> 42:18.036
Oh, no, I-I might
eat something too.

42:18.119 --> 42:19.871
What about money?

42:19.955 --> 42:22.791
Could you stop whining about
money for two seconds, maybe?

42:26.503 --> 42:29.923
Brought some popcorn shrimp
back from my shitty-ass job.

42:30.006 --> 42:31.883
- Yum.
- I'm turning the furnace on.

42:31.967 --> 42:33.802
Gotta check
for carbon monoxide leaks.

42:36.304 --> 42:38.390
You need a job, Fiona.

42:38.473 --> 42:40.100
Mm-hmm.

42:51.611 --> 42:53.655
What the hell?

43:18.680 --> 43:20.765
No! Shit!

43:22.642 --> 43:24.102
Come on.

43:30.233 --> 43:31.318
Fuck.

43:31.401 --> 43:32.611
Help!

43:32.694 --> 43:33.987
I'm stuck down here!

43:34.070 --> 43:36.615
I'm coming.
I'm coming.

43:38.033 --> 43:39.826
I said I'm coming!

43:39.909 --> 43:41.369
So, uh, what I'm hearing
you say, Sally,

43:41.453 --> 43:43.747
is that even though
you're still mad at Lou,

43:43.830 --> 43:46.291
you are willing to focus
on the good things he does.

43:46.374 --> 43:48.960
Sally, your therapist
is having a tea party

43:49.044 --> 43:50.253
with stuffed animals.

43:50.337 --> 43:52.130
Door's open.

43:52.213 --> 43:53.798
Yeah?

43:53.882 --> 43:54.966
We're looking for Ingrid.

43:55.050 --> 43:56.926
I'm her ex-husband.
This is Dr. Kwan--

43:57.010 --> 43:58.136
Oh, I don't give a fuck
who you are.

43:58.219 --> 43:59.429
She's right here.

44:01.765 --> 44:03.099
Yeah, you know, Sally,

44:03.183 --> 44:04.643
we will have
to continue this later

44:04.726 --> 44:06.478
same time next week.

44:09.939 --> 44:12.776
I cannot believe
that you betrayed me

44:12.859 --> 44:14.277
and brought her here.

44:14.361 --> 44:16.237
Ingrid, Dr. Kwan
explained to me

44:16.321 --> 44:18.281
that you will bleed out
and die

44:18.365 --> 44:20.116
if you carry six babies
to term.

44:20.200 --> 44:22.744
Then why did you implant
all those embryos in me?

44:22.827 --> 44:24.579
Because there was only
a five percent chance

44:24.663 --> 44:26.373
of any of them
surviving implantation

44:26.456 --> 44:28.083
in your shriveled-up uterus.

44:28.166 --> 44:30.460
So what you're saying is,
I'm a medical miracle?

44:30.543 --> 44:31.753
You'll be a medical tragedy

44:31.836 --> 44:34.047
if you carry all six
of those fetuses to term.

44:34.130 --> 44:35.965
I am willing
to take my chances.

44:36.049 --> 44:37.759
Ingrid, we are gonna go
to Dr. Kwan's office.

44:37.842 --> 44:39.386
- No.
- She is gonna do

44:39.469 --> 44:40.470
- the procedure, and then...
- No, no, no, no.

44:40.553 --> 44:41.554
...I will take you home.

44:41.638 --> 44:42.972
No!
Get out of my house!

44:43.056 --> 44:45.392
Bitch, if you don't come
to my office right now,

44:45.475 --> 44:47.894
I will go North Korean on you
and reach into your vagina

44:47.977 --> 44:50.355
and rip those embryos
out of you with my bare hands!

44:50.438 --> 44:52.399
Doctor, please!

44:52.482 --> 44:54.609
She is trying to kill
my babies!

44:56.444 --> 44:58.363
Ingrid?

44:59.864 --> 45:01.533
Ingrid?
Oh, crap.

45:01.616 --> 45:02.659
Ingy.

45:04.661 --> 45:07.247
<i>Ingrid?
Open this door!</i>

45:07.330 --> 45:08.957
<i>- Please.
- Hello?</i>

45:09.040 --> 45:10.625
<i>- Is somebody down here?
- Please!</i>

45:10.709 --> 45:12.001
<i>- I'm trapped!
- Ingrid.</i>

45:12.085 --> 45:14.587
Well, we all feel trapped
at some point.

45:14.671 --> 45:16.297
Uh, do you want
to talk about it?

45:16.381 --> 45:19.175
No, you crazy bitch!
It's Debbie!

45:19.259 --> 45:21.761
I need to get out of here
and turn off the gas

45:21.845 --> 45:23.138
<i>before the house blows up!</i>

45:23.221 --> 45:24.806
Debbie?

45:25.432 --> 45:26.433
Debbie?

45:26.516 --> 45:27.559
Help!

45:27.642 --> 45:29.644
<i>Help!</i>

45:29.728 --> 45:31.187
<i>Somebody help!</i>

45:31.271 --> 45:32.480
Debbie?

45:32.564 --> 45:33.565
Kelly?

45:37.360 --> 45:38.737
My pants are stuck.

45:38.820 --> 45:40.155
<i>Can you take them off?</i>

45:40.238 --> 45:41.114
What?

45:41.197 --> 45:43.742
Just take off your pants!

45:43.825 --> 45:45.785
Oh.

45:48.705 --> 45:50.206
Uh...

46:01.217 --> 46:02.594
Oh, my God.

46:07.974 --> 46:09.392
Nice ass.

46:11.227 --> 46:12.437

turned off.

46:56.898 --> 46:58.817
Neighbor said
there was a disturbance.

46:58.900 --> 47:00.276
Yeah, Officer, I called.
That was me.

47:00.360 --> 47:01.611
Seems to be the problem?

47:01.694 --> 47:03.446
These kids are up to no good.

47:03.530 --> 47:04.989
They are making
way too much noise, okay?

47:05.073 --> 47:06.741
They are getting water
on my car.

47:06.825 --> 47:08.535
Noise?
That's Tyler the Creator.

47:08.618 --> 47:09.911
They don't belong here, sir.

47:09.994 --> 47:11.454
We live two streets over.

47:11.538 --> 47:12.747
Well, I mean,
do you have a-a permit

47:12.831 --> 47:14.082
to operate a food stand
in front of my house?

47:14.165 --> 47:15.500
Ask them, sir.
Do they?

47:15.583 --> 47:17.252
You need a permit
to sell lemonade?

47:20.755 --> 47:23.091
Eighty-three-ten
will respond.

47:23.174 --> 47:25.260
Move the lemonade stand
down the street

47:25.343 --> 47:26.511
and turn down the music.

47:26.594 --> 47:28.263
Wait, sir, that's it?

47:28.346 --> 47:29.681
What do you
want me to do, lady?

47:29.764 --> 47:31.140
Shut them down.

47:31.224 --> 47:32.892
I just got my car washed.

47:35.144 --> 47:36.729
You know what?

47:36.813 --> 47:38.231
Looks like y'all made
enough money.

47:38.314 --> 47:39.649
Why don't you close up shop
for the day?

47:39.732 --> 47:40.942
What?
Why?

47:42.360 --> 47:43.695
Just do it.

47:43.778 --> 47:46.114
It's not worth the aggravation.

47:46.197 --> 47:47.198
Here's 20 bucks.

Big family dinner.
This is exactly what I wanted.

48:33.286 --> 48:35.204
Are you enjoying
the food, Martina?

48:35.288 --> 48:37.790
Better than what they had
in the holding cell.

48:37.874 --> 48:39.000
Oh.

48:39.083 --> 48:40.710
I am so sorry
they put you there.

48:40.793 --> 48:43.880
This is not what America's
normally like.

48:43.963 --> 48:45.089
I thought you were
supposed to be

48:45.173 --> 48:46.716
the greatest country
in the world.

48:47.675 --> 48:49.719
You caught us at a bad time.

48:58.937 --> 49:01.648
Hey, what do you say we, um,
finish up dinner

49:01.731 --> 49:03.358
and watch some TV?
Hmm?

49:03.441 --> 49:06.027
You guys have <i>Pawn Stars</i>
in Guatemala?

49:09.322 --> 49:11.616
Uh, we cannot stay
after dinner.

49:11.699 --> 49:12.825
We have to go back.

49:13.993 --> 49:15.995
Back?
To the detention center?

49:16.537 --> 49:18.039
To Guatemala.

49:18.122 --> 49:20.083
We go tonight
with our uncle.

49:20.166 --> 49:21.250
Your uncle?

49:21.334 --> 49:22.752
Jose Gomez?

49:24.253 --> 49:26.381
Our father was deported,
so we have to go back

49:26.464 --> 49:27.465
to be with him.

49:27.548 --> 49:30.259
Deported?
I'm so sorry.

49:30.343 --> 49:33.054
<i>Sí.</i>
Thank you for

49:33.137 --> 49:34.764
offering to foster us,

49:34.847 --> 49:37.433
but your country
no longer wants

49:37.517 --> 49:40.186
the tired and poor,
yearning to be free,

49:40.269 --> 49:43.856
like the big green lady
in the New York Harbor says.

49:43.940 --> 49:45.108
Big green lady?

49:45.191 --> 49:46.484
Statue of Liberty.

49:54.951 --> 49:57.036
She's been napping
a long time.

49:57.120 --> 49:58.955
Probably hasn't slept
in days.

49:59.831 --> 50:01.666
Yeah, you know,
you can go if you want.

50:02.583 --> 50:04.043
Are you giving me permission?

50:04.127 --> 50:04.919
No.

50:05.003 --> 50:07.213
No, I just mean

50:07.296 --> 50:09.340
if this is too much
to deal with,

50:09.424 --> 50:10.508
you know, I understand.

50:10.591 --> 50:11.592
You really think I do

50:11.676 --> 50:13.011
anything I don't want to do?

50:17.223 --> 50:20.309
No, probably not.

50:20.393 --> 50:21.728
Damn right.

50:31.279 --> 50:32.989
Got you. Yes.

50:34.949 --> 50:36.492
Hi.

50:36.576 --> 50:38.244
Hey, buddy.
What's up?

50:38.327 --> 50:39.996
Some lady called
the cops on me.

50:40.079 --> 50:41.247
What'd you do?

50:41.330 --> 50:43.416
Nothing, just selling lemonade
in front of her house.

50:43.499 --> 50:46.461
Said we got water
on her fancy car.

50:52.759 --> 50:53.760
What lady?

50:53.843 --> 50:55.053
Over on Bundy.

50:55.136 --> 50:56.596
The one who bought
Mr. Reeback's house

50:56.679 --> 50:57.680
and redid it?

50:57.764 --> 50:59.766
Uh-huh.

50:59.849 --> 51:00.975
Who were you with?

51:01.059 --> 51:02.310
Some friends from school,

51:02.393 --> 51:03.603
Todd and De-shawn.

51:03.686 --> 51:05.104
Black kids?

51:05.188 --> 51:07.065
Yeah.

51:07.148 --> 51:08.858
Motherfucker.

51:11.402 --> 51:12.403
Yo!

51:18.493 --> 51:20.828
We're not gonna eat
this stuff, right?

51:20.912 --> 51:22.080
Oh, no, hell no.

51:22.163 --> 51:23.664
We're gonna <i>Fear Factor</i>

51:23.748 --> 51:24.791

51:24.874 --> 51:25.958
I made it.

51:26.042 --> 51:28.461
Shit.
Damn it.

51:30.463 --> 51:32.757
Can't keep this player
from the game, Frank.

51:32.840 --> 51:34.050
How did you get out?

51:34.133 --> 51:35.927
Garbage truck came by.

51:36.010 --> 51:37.804
Dumped me in the back.
It was rough,

51:37.887 --> 51:39.847
but a pile of old Big Macs
broke my fall.

51:39.931 --> 51:41.474
All right, welcome back.

51:41.557 --> 51:42.892
We'll now go around
and take our pick

51:42.975 --> 51:46.479
for the dumpster dive
competition.

51:47.688 --> 51:48.815
Sushi, huh?

51:48.898 --> 51:50.066
Brave choice.

52:15.424 --> 52:16.968
Hey!

52:17.051 --> 52:19.720
You know that new bitch
over on Bundy?

52:19.804 --> 52:21.097

53:42.470 --> 53:45.056
I have no idea
what he said.

53:45.139 --> 53:47.475
It was good.
He smiled.

53:50.811 --> 53:53.064
There goes my son.

54:00.196 --> 54:02.490
I have called the police.

54:04.033 --> 54:05.785
They are on their way.

You are disturbing the peace.

54:09.622 --> 54:11.624
Hey, lady.

54:11.707 --> 54:14.126
That was my brother
with the lemonade stand.

54:14.210 --> 54:15.836
- What?
- That's right.

54:15.920 --> 54:17.338
I got a black brother.

54:19.882 --> 54:21.592
What?
That's why you didn't want him

54:21.676 --> 54:23.427

54:23.511 --> 54:25.721
'Cause he's black?

54:26.389 --> 54:28.432
Okay, you need to go home.

54:28.516 --> 54:30.268
Some of us have jobs.

54:30.351 --> 54:31.686
You know, I lived
in this neighborhood

54:31.769 --> 54:33.312
my whole life.

54:34.272 --> 54:38.317
Kids have always
sold lemonade right here.

54:38.401 --> 54:41.070
Black kids, white kids,

54:41.153 --> 54:43.698
Russian kids, Mexican kids.

54:43.781 --> 54:45.199
Would you get away
from my fence?

54:46.325 --> 54:51.038
Nobody ever had a problem
with lemonade stands

54:51.122 --> 54:54.542
