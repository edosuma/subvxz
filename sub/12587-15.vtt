<b><font color="#0E7521">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

00:32.323 --> 00:33.621
I've identified

00:33.617 --> 00:35.085
two of your problems, Bill.

00:35.244 --> 00:37.087
There's no oil in your oil pan,

00:37.079 --> 00:40.629
but lots of it in your
windshield washer reservoir.

00:40.624 --> 00:43.173
I don't know if we can save
this engine.

00:43.168 --> 00:46.092
Our best bet might be
to take out the floorboards

00:46.088 --> 00:47.931
and make this a Flintstones car.

00:47.923 --> 00:50.096
I'd say you should donate it
to charity,

00:50.259 --> 00:53.138
but charity people have
enough problems.

00:53.303 --> 00:56.352
Dang it, Bill, you know
this car deserves better.

00:56.348 --> 00:59.648
Sorry, Hank.
Sorry, car.

01:01.186 --> 01:03.359
Dale, you missed the trash can.

01:03.355 --> 01:04.402
Meh.

01:04.397 --> 01:07.197
Hank, you will
never believe who is on

01:07.192 --> 01:08.444
our answering machine.

01:08.443 --> 01:09.569
Didi.

01:09.570 --> 01:11.413
Didi?
What does she want?

01:11.405 --> 01:13.248
My dad's been dead over a year.

01:13.240 --> 01:16.164
I was hoping she'd
take that as the end

01:16.159 --> 01:17.081
of her step-mothering
duties.

01:17.244 --> 01:19.167
My guess is, with Cotton gone,

01:19.162 --> 01:22.086
Didi's probably lonely and
desperate for a new man.

01:22.249 --> 01:24.468
Prepare for war, Peggy.

01:24.459 --> 01:25.881
Shut up, Dale.

01:25.877 --> 01:28.130
I better go give it a listen.

01:28.297 --> 01:31.096
Dale, you're gonna pick up
that can, right?

01:31.091 --> 01:34.015
Maybe I'll pick it up,
maybe I won't.

01:34.011 --> 01:35.684
We call that suspense.

01:37.264 --> 01:39.483
This is Didi Hill.

01:39.474 --> 01:41.693
Cotton asked
that I give you this.

01:41.685 --> 01:43.187
See you... soon.

01:43.186 --> 01:44.187
"This"?

01:44.187 --> 01:45.609
What does she mean by "this"?

01:45.606 --> 01:47.404
We can't see
through the dang phone.

01:47.399 --> 01:48.776
This is bad, Hank.

01:48.775 --> 01:51.779
Nothing involving your
father ever turns out good.

01:51.778 --> 01:53.200
You know what I've
been wondering?

01:53.196 --> 01:55.290
Was Grandpa a good dancer?

01:55.282 --> 01:57.080
Because-- no offense--

01:57.075 --> 02:00.045
There's no way I got my moves
from either of you.

02:00.037 --> 02:01.630
Well, I don't think your grandpa

02:01.622 --> 02:03.169
liked to dance, Bobby.

02:03.165 --> 02:05.759
Dancing conveys
a certain amount of joy

02:05.751 --> 02:08.095
that I don't think
your grandfather condoned.

02:08.252 --> 02:11.051
Okay, then,
what did Grandpa like?

02:11.048 --> 02:13.176
Well, uh, he was a war hero.

02:13.175 --> 02:15.177
He killed 50 men...

02:15.177 --> 02:16.929
and, uh, well, you know,

02:16.928 --> 02:19.647
that's a lot of, uh...
a lot of men.

02:19.640 --> 02:22.143
Hmm, there's got to be
something else.

02:24.645 --> 02:27.649
You must be very
proud, Mr. Hill.

02:27.648 --> 02:28.820
Of course I am.

02:28.815 --> 02:30.158
I killed 50 men.

02:31.693 --> 02:33.787
I killed 50 men!

02:35.322 --> 02:37.416
I killed 50 men.

02:39.242 --> 02:40.459
Hmm.

02:40.452 --> 02:42.671
I don't think I know
anything about my dad.

02:42.663 --> 02:44.506
Well, other than his hatred

02:44.498 --> 02:47.172
of Tojos, Nazis and my mother.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.966
Well, hatred was just about
all there was to Cotton.

02:49.961 --> 02:51.178
And...

02:51.171 --> 02:53.390
no, no, just hatred.

02:54.800 --> 02:56.143
Maybe it's normal

02:56.134 --> 02:57.886
not to know much
about your father.

02:57.886 --> 03:00.105
How much do you guys
know about your dads?

03:00.097 --> 03:02.850
If anything, I know too much
about my father.

03:02.849 --> 03:05.523
It's all tucked away
in the corners of my brain

03:05.519 --> 03:07.442
that alcohol can't reach.

03:07.437 --> 03:09.189
I was able to piece together

03:09.189 --> 03:11.408
an interesting
history of my father

03:11.400 --> 03:13.744
using mug shots and
dental records.

03:13.735 --> 03:15.282
My dad collects stamps.

03:15.278 --> 03:17.201
His favorite color is dark blue.

03:17.197 --> 03:18.824
Oh, and he loves paella,

03:18.824 --> 03:21.418
especially when it's made
by his boyfriend, Stephano.

03:21.410 --> 03:23.083
Well...

03:23.245 --> 03:25.168
Didi's coming by tomorrow.

03:25.163 --> 03:26.585
It might be my last chance

03:26.581 --> 03:28.174
to ask her some questions
about him.

03:28.166 --> 03:30.510
So, are you going to
pick up that can, Dale?

03:30.502 --> 03:33.005
I have a to-do list
a mile long,

03:33.004 --> 03:35.883
but when I get done with
everything on that list...

03:35.882 --> 03:37.680
uh, I can't lie to you, Bill.

03:37.676 --> 03:39.394
I'm not going to do it.

03:52.441 --> 03:54.193
Open that door, Dale!

03:54.192 --> 03:55.614
What do you want?

03:55.610 --> 03:57.362
I want you to pick up the can!

03:57.362 --> 03:58.363
Why me?

03:58.363 --> 03:59.364
You're closer. Geez.

03:59.364 --> 04:00.741
I swear.

04:00.741 --> 04:02.869
It's like you don't have
any respect for me.

04:02.868 --> 04:03.915
Of course I don't.

04:03.910 --> 04:04.957
Look at you.

04:06.037 --> 04:07.334
I'm tired of being ignored.

04:07.330 --> 04:09.458
You're picking that can up
right now!

04:10.959 --> 04:12.757
Oh, here's something
I've been curious about.

04:12.753 --> 04:15.176
Did my dad ever use
the ratchet set

04:15.172 --> 04:16.845
we got him for his birthday?

04:16.839 --> 04:18.091
The drop-forged one,

04:18.091 --> 04:20.469
not the heat-treated one
we gave him for Christmas.

04:20.469 --> 04:23.097
That's your seventh question
about Cotton's tools.

04:23.096 --> 04:25.098
I think you should
try a new area.

04:25.098 --> 04:28.193
You know, all this stuff
about Grandpa got me worrying

04:28.185 --> 04:30.483
that maybe I don't know enough
about you.

04:30.479 --> 04:32.356
Like, when you were my age,

04:32.355 --> 04:35.529
did you practice kissing
on your hand or your pillow?

04:35.525 --> 04:37.198
Yeah, uh...

04:37.194 --> 04:40.198
that question being
of a personal nature and such,

04:40.197 --> 04:42.040
it's kind of difficult to, uh...

04:42.032 --> 04:44.160
Pick it up, pick
it up, pick it up!

04:44.159 --> 04:47.663
Gribble and Dauterive
really going at it.

04:47.662 --> 04:49.380
The chain-smoking anorexic

04:49.372 --> 04:51.795
versus the heart attack
waiting to happen.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.135
Who will die first?

04:53.293 --> 04:54.545
Let's watch.

04:54.544 --> 04:55.636
I don't know why

04:55.629 --> 04:57.506
you're so worried
about that can, Bill.

04:57.506 --> 04:59.179
If it's anything
like your ex-wife,

04:59.174 --> 05:02.519
it'll come to its senses
and walk away... forever.

05:02.511 --> 05:04.058
You know what?

05:04.054 --> 05:05.977
I haven't liked you for years!

05:05.972 --> 05:07.189
Hold on, Bill.

05:07.182 --> 05:09.401
Dale, the only reason
lever hung out with you

05:09.392 --> 05:12.020
was because of Boomhauer and Hank.
- Oh, really?

05:12.020 --> 05:14.990
Then how come just last week you
said you were my best friend?

05:14.981 --> 05:16.904
I pretended you were Hank
when I said it!

05:16.900 --> 05:19.198
Okay, that's enough, you two.

05:19.194 --> 05:22.698
You're dead to me,
Bill Dauterive!

05:22.697 --> 05:25.701
Good, I'd rather be dead
than be your friend anyway!

05:30.872 --> 05:32.840
Boycott Dale Gribble!

05:32.833 --> 05:36.178
He is an exterminator of bugs
and friendship!

05:36.169 --> 05:39.389
Do not let him into your house
or your hearts!

05:39.381 --> 05:41.725
This fight seems
to be getting serious.

05:41.716 --> 05:44.185
Looks like I'm going to have
to do something to end this.

05:44.177 --> 05:46.475
I'm going to go grab
a case of Alamo Gold

05:46.471 --> 05:48.894
and sit them down
until this thing is figured out.

05:48.890 --> 05:50.642
I think it's too late for that.

05:50.642 --> 05:53.771
This has gone beyond a fight,
and has officially become

05:53.770 --> 05:55.022
a "dude-vorce."

05:55.021 --> 05:55.897
A what?

05:55.897 --> 05:57.194
A "dude-vorce" is what happens

05:57.190 --> 05:59.067
when male friends break up.

05:59.067 --> 06:01.490
Parade magazine
did a whole half page on it.

06:01.486 --> 06:02.533
It's true.

06:02.529 --> 06:04.952
I heard that one in two
male friendships

06:04.948 --> 06:06.746
now ends in "dude-vorce."

06:06.741 --> 06:08.914
It's so sad when dudes
grow apart.

06:08.910 --> 06:11.129
She's here!
Didi's here!

06:14.791 --> 06:16.418
Hello, Hank. Peggy.

06:16.418 --> 06:18.386
Hello, Didi.
How have you been?

06:18.378 --> 06:22.178
Excellent. I'm getting married
to a wealthy professional...

06:22.173 --> 06:23.174
wrestler.

06:23.174 --> 06:24.892
Anyway, this box is for you.

06:24.885 --> 06:26.637
Sorry, I'm so late
getting it to you.

06:26.636 --> 06:29.389
You have no idea how difficult
it has been to grieve

06:29.389 --> 06:31.608
and fall madly in love
at the same time.

06:31.600 --> 06:33.568
Now I have to go.
Wait, wait!

06:33.560 --> 06:35.107
Are you sure
you can't stick around?

06:35.270 --> 06:38.023
I have some things I wanted
to ask you about my dad.

06:38.023 --> 06:40.697
I'm sorry, Hank, but I had to
clear Cotton out of my mind

06:40.692 --> 06:42.786
so I could make room
for my new husband.

06:42.777 --> 06:44.620
But, but I have a list!

06:44.613 --> 06:47.992
"Did my dad like
Washington apples?"

06:50.243 --> 06:52.371
What's in it? I can't
stand the waiting!

06:52.370 --> 06:54.839
Well, looks like
some of my dad's medals,

06:54.831 --> 06:56.925
uniforms, some paperwork...

06:56.917 --> 06:59.011
It's his personal belongings.

06:59.002 --> 07:01.175
He must have wanted
you to have these, Hank.

07:01.171 --> 07:04.141
Maybe your dad did not
hate you, after all.

07:05.508 --> 07:07.556
Hey, a tape recorder.

07:07.552 --> 07:08.895
Hank,

07:08.887 --> 07:10.810
I know no parent ever wants

07:10.805 --> 07:13.558
their kids to outlive them,
but if you're hearing this,

07:13.558 --> 07:15.902
I guess somehow
you pulled it off.

07:15.894 --> 07:18.647
Anyway, here's a box
of my possessions

07:18.647 --> 07:20.194
and a list of my wishes.

07:20.190 --> 07:22.568
As the executor of my estate,

07:22.567 --> 07:24.945
you gots to do
everything I tells ya.

07:24.945 --> 07:28.199
It won't be pretty and you're
probably going to cry a little.

07:28.198 --> 07:30.200
Just remember, I'll be watching.

07:30.200 --> 07:31.167
And laughing.

07:31.159 --> 07:33.662
That is all.

07:38.166 --> 07:40.385
Oh, that man had some nerve!

07:40.377 --> 07:42.721
All you wanted was to know
a little bit about him,

07:42.712 --> 07:44.180
and what do you get in return?

07:44.172 --> 07:45.594
His dirty work.

07:45.590 --> 07:47.968
Oh, I'm sorry, Hank.

07:47.968 --> 07:49.185
Why are you sorry?

07:49.177 --> 07:52.181
My dad has made me
the executor of his will.

07:52.180 --> 07:53.932
I'm finally going to learn
something about him.

07:53.932 --> 07:54.933
Wow!

07:54.933 --> 07:56.901
Look at all this shin jelly!

07:56.893 --> 07:58.190
And a gun!

07:58.186 --> 08:00.029
Oh, dear Lord.
Put that thing down!

08:00.021 --> 08:01.898
Let me see that list.

08:01.898 --> 08:06.324
Oh, I see he left Dale,
Bill and Boomhauer something.

08:06.319 --> 08:08.538
And of course,
I see nothing for you

08:08.530 --> 08:10.248
on this list, Hank-- typical.

08:10.240 --> 08:11.241
That's not true.

08:11.241 --> 08:13.585
My dad gave me
the greatest gift:

08:13.576 --> 08:16.079
the trust and honor
of handling his affairs.

08:16.246 --> 08:19.341
Honor? Have you seen what
he wants you to do, Hank?

08:19.332 --> 08:22.461
"Give the finger to the bouncer
at Juggstore Cowboys."

08:22.460 --> 08:25.179
"Spit on the steps
of the Japanese Embassy."

08:25.171 --> 08:26.172
The man is dead.

08:26.172 --> 08:27.719
You do not have to do this.

08:27.716 --> 08:29.434
Peggy, my dad entrusted me

08:29.426 --> 08:32.645
with his final wishes and I have
to see it through for him.

08:32.636 --> 08:34.605
I can't just throw
the list away.

08:34.597 --> 08:35.769
He's right.

08:35.765 --> 08:38.143
This thing is like
a treasure map of Grandpa.

08:38.308 --> 08:40.186
Can I come with you when you

08:40.186 --> 08:43.155
"slap the butt of some
brunette nurses at the V.A."?

08:43.313 --> 08:44.110
No!
No!

08:45.191 --> 08:46.864
Tell him

08:46.860 --> 08:49.454
I want my kiddie pool
and my leaf blower.

08:49.446 --> 08:51.414
Okay, uh, next issue.

08:51.406 --> 08:54.159
Gribble wants the kiddie pool
and his leaf blower back,

08:54.159 --> 08:55.536
as well as the alley
on Saturdays.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.503
No sale!
We already gave you

08:57.495 --> 08:59.168
the Arlen High football tickets

08:59.164 --> 09:01.633
and the alley
every other Sunday.

09:01.624 --> 09:03.752
What the heck is going on here?

09:03.752 --> 09:05.846
Hank, when it comes
to a breakup,

09:05.837 --> 09:09.808
there are no winners,
only losers-- two losers.

09:09.799 --> 09:12.177
Can you guys just
put it on hold for a second?

09:12.177 --> 09:14.100
I have some stuff
I have to give you

09:14.095 --> 09:15.187
from my dad.

09:15.180 --> 09:17.649
Cotton brought that fork
back from Germany.

09:17.640 --> 09:20.689
I'm, uh, pretty sure
he killed somebody with it.

09:20.685 --> 09:22.528
It's beautiful!

09:22.520 --> 09:24.397
I love getting gifts, Hank.

09:24.397 --> 09:26.195
I'm pretty sure Dale
doesn't know that though,

09:26.191 --> 09:28.489
since he hasn't gotten me
anything for my birthday

09:28.485 --> 09:29.987
for the last 14 years.

09:29.986 --> 09:31.203
That's right, I counted!

09:31.196 --> 09:34.200
What can you possibly
give the man who has nothing?

09:34.199 --> 09:35.792
Look, I could really use

09:35.784 --> 09:37.878
both of your help
with my dad's estate.

09:37.869 --> 09:40.167
So just punch each other
or grill a steak,

09:40.163 --> 09:42.712
and get this ridiculous
fight over with.

09:42.707 --> 09:44.050
Meat won't solve this, Hank.

09:44.042 --> 09:45.669
Not this time.

09:45.668 --> 09:47.670
So either pick
a side or get lost.

09:48.755 --> 09:50.928
Now, where were we?

09:52.175 --> 09:53.768
Gribble's gonna need that fork.

09:53.760 --> 09:55.182
No way!

09:55.178 --> 09:57.180
It'll go well with this knife.

09:57.180 --> 09:59.148
Give him fork, Dauterive.

10:02.185 --> 10:04.153
Well, thanks for offering
to help me, Peggy,

10:04.312 --> 10:06.440
but I don't know if
you should come in.

10:06.439 --> 10:07.656
You've seen the list.

10:07.649 --> 10:09.777
This might not be
the place for a lady.

10:09.776 --> 10:12.074
Hank, I'm looking
on the bright side.

10:12.070 --> 10:14.448
This list will let me
relive Cotton's death

10:14.447 --> 10:16.074
over and over again.

10:19.160 --> 10:22.630
Uh, thanks for meeting us,
Madame Francine.

10:22.622 --> 10:25.125
Uh, this is for you
from my father.

10:27.669 --> 10:30.593
So, you knew my father,
apparently.

10:30.588 --> 10:33.137
Uh, is there anything you can
tell me about him?

10:33.133 --> 10:36.854
Yes. Of all his platoon mates,

10:36.845 --> 10:40.566
Cotton was the most curious
and inventive lover.

10:44.310 --> 10:45.983
Uh, excuse me.

10:45.979 --> 10:47.902
Are you two the Cleery sisters?

10:47.897 --> 10:49.149
Yes, sir.

10:49.149 --> 10:51.493
Uh, this is from Cotton Hill.

10:52.986 --> 10:55.455
I'm very sorry.

10:58.825 --> 11:00.668
Oh, for heaven's sake.

11:00.660 --> 11:03.163
Oh!

11:03.163 --> 11:05.165
<i>What an awful day.</i>

11:05.165 --> 11:06.963
You know, I'm really
starting to wonder

11:06.958 --> 11:08.551
what the point of all this is.

11:08.543 --> 11:10.921
Maybe the point was
for Cotton to humiliate you

11:10.920 --> 11:12.137
one last time.

11:12.297 --> 11:15.517
Well, all we have left
to do is deliver this spat

11:15.508 --> 11:17.181
to someone named Fatty.

11:17.177 --> 11:19.179
And then it's all finally over.

11:19.179 --> 11:20.146
Thank God.

11:20.305 --> 11:22.273
Yeah, I guess.

11:28.605 --> 11:31.108
Hi, uh, I'm looking for Fatty.

11:31.274 --> 11:32.150
Fatty dead.

11:32.317 --> 11:34.160
I'm his son, Little Fatty.
Who you?

11:34.152 --> 11:36.120
Well, I'm Cotton Hill's
son, Hank.

11:36.279 --> 11:38.452
My dad was in the service
with your father.

11:38.448 --> 11:40.200
He passed away last year,

11:40.200 --> 11:42.623
and he wanted your
father to have this.

11:42.619 --> 11:43.620
Oh, yeah.

11:43.620 --> 11:44.917
Daddy Fatty told me about that.

11:44.913 --> 11:45.880
I'll take it.

11:50.460 --> 11:52.588
What the hell was that for?

11:57.467 --> 11:59.720
Oh, Hank, I know
you were looking

11:59.719 --> 12:01.642
to find out something
about your father,

12:01.638 --> 12:04.608
but apparently it was
just not meant to be.

12:08.436 --> 12:11.406
This key opens a box
at the bus station.

12:12.941 --> 12:14.659
And sorry about the stomping.

12:14.651 --> 12:16.244
That was Cotton's wish.

12:20.615 --> 12:22.208
Well, here it is.

12:22.200 --> 12:24.828
Box 1942.

12:24.827 --> 12:27.080
Open it slowly, Hank.

12:27.080 --> 12:29.048
It could be booby-trapped.

12:33.169 --> 12:37.174
<i>"Boy, if you're reading
this, it means Fatty's dead.</i>

12:37.173 --> 12:40.177
<i>"It also means this last task
comes down</i>

12:40.176 --> 12:43.430
<i>to the one most likely
to screw it up... you."</i>

12:43.429 --> 12:45.147
Oh, God.

12:45.139 --> 12:48.188
<i>"Take what's in this box
and flush it down the crapper</i>

12:48.184 --> 12:50.186
<i>"that General
George S. Patton used</i>

12:50.186 --> 12:52.188
<i>"right before he left
to hunt down</i>

12:52.188 --> 12:54.816
<i>Pancho Villa in Mexico."</i>

12:54.816 --> 12:59.037
Wha-what on earth would Cotton
want flushed down a toilet?

13:02.073 --> 13:03.575
Good Lord, Peggy.

13:04.659 --> 13:08.038
My dad wants me to flush him!

13:13.084 --> 13:17.806
What kind of man asks his son to
flush his remains down a toilet?

13:17.797 --> 13:19.799
Look on the bright side,
Uncle Hank.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.927
This would have been
much more difficult

13:21.926 --> 13:23.928
if Cotton hadn't had
the foresight

13:23.928 --> 13:25.976
to cremate himself first.

13:25.972 --> 13:28.976
Apparently it's some sort of
tradition in Cotton's platoon.

13:28.975 --> 13:30.192
After one of them dies,

13:30.184 --> 13:31.777
the remaining members reunite

13:31.769 --> 13:34.522
to send their buddy off
to a watery grave.

13:34.522 --> 13:37.446
Which just happens
to be a toilet.

13:37.442 --> 13:40.662
Well, it doesn't sound very
respectful if you ask me.

13:40.653 --> 13:42.655
But if that's
what my dad wanted,

13:42.655 --> 13:45.204
then that's what I have to do.

13:45.199 --> 13:46.325
I don't know, Hank.

13:46.326 --> 13:48.328
General Patton's toilet
would definitely be

13:48.328 --> 13:50.956
in my top three places
where I'd like to get flushed.

13:50.955 --> 13:53.879
Right behind the one
Elvis died on and yours.

13:53.875 --> 13:56.469
I want
my skeleton to be dismantled

13:56.461 --> 13:59.806
and sent in a box to
Singapore to be re-mantled.

13:59.797 --> 14:02.016
Dang it, Dale.
If you're gonna participate

14:02.008 --> 14:04.852
in the discussion
you have to be here in person.

14:04.844 --> 14:06.096
DALE No can do.

14:06.095 --> 14:08.018
Not as long as
what's-his-fat is there.

14:08.014 --> 14:09.186
According to our agreement

14:09.182 --> 14:11.776
I have the alley from
3:00 to 5:00 p.m.

14:11.768 --> 14:13.190
Kahn said it's within
my legal right

14:13.186 --> 14:14.859
to pull his batteries
out at any time.

14:14.854 --> 14:15.855
Hey!

14:15.855 --> 14:17.152
Relax, Bill.

14:17.148 --> 14:20.152
So when do you and I
and not Bill leave, Hank?

14:20.151 --> 14:22.199
I've got my flushing arm ready.

14:22.195 --> 14:24.914
What? Why does Dale get to
go flush the colonel?!

14:24.906 --> 14:25.998
I hate Dale.

14:25.990 --> 14:27.037
We all hate Dale!

14:27.033 --> 14:28.626
Dang it, I've had enough
of this.

14:28.618 --> 14:30.120
Neither of you are going.

14:30.119 --> 14:31.871
Boomhauer, we leave tonight.

14:31.871 --> 14:34.090
Dang ol' yo, man.

14:39.170 --> 14:41.844
Let's get this over with.

14:51.766 --> 14:53.188
Okay.

14:53.184 --> 14:54.401
There's the bathroom.

14:54.394 --> 14:55.691
Let's go.

14:59.774 --> 15:01.572
What are you guys doing here?

15:01.567 --> 15:03.490
You should be asking Dale that.

15:03.486 --> 15:04.487
Because it's Saturday,

15:04.487 --> 15:05.830
and I get Hank on Saturdays!

15:05.822 --> 15:08.200
That was pending negotiation!

15:08.199 --> 15:10.042
So anyway, Hank, I was thinking

15:10.034 --> 15:11.627
that since I was
Cotton's favorite,

15:11.619 --> 15:13.087
I should be the one

15:13.079 --> 15:14.080
to push the flusher.

15:14.247 --> 15:15.840
This is a military ceremony,

15:15.832 --> 15:17.129
and since I'm military,
I should flush!

15:17.291 --> 15:18.759
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

15:18.751 --> 15:20.173
I know what you're doing.

15:20.169 --> 15:21.512
You're trying to flush someone

15:21.504 --> 15:23.051
down Patton's toilet,
aren't you?

15:23.047 --> 15:24.390
Uh, well,

15:24.382 --> 15:26.180
it was my dad's last request.

15:26.175 --> 15:27.927
See, he was a veteran, and...

15:27.927 --> 15:30.146
I don't care if he was
George S. Patton himself.

15:30.138 --> 15:31.185
I'm sick of all this.

15:31.180 --> 15:32.807
Guys come in here all the time

15:32.807 --> 15:34.650
trying to flush their dead
relatives down that toilet,

15:34.642 --> 15:36.019
and you know what
happens each time?

15:36.018 --> 15:37.190
My toilet gets clogged.

15:37.186 --> 15:39.188
And you know
who has to pay to unclog it?

15:39.188 --> 15:40.189
Me.

15:40.189 --> 15:41.190
But my dad's...

15:41.190 --> 15:42.157
Out!

15:45.319 --> 15:47.663
All your blabbing in there
reminded me how much

15:47.655 --> 15:50.329
I want to push you
into traffic-- mouth first.

15:50.324 --> 15:51.792
How dare you!

15:51.784 --> 15:53.161
Sucker punch!

15:54.245 --> 15:55.838
All right, that's enough!

15:55.830 --> 15:57.423
I've had it with your fighting

15:57.415 --> 16:00.009
and with my dad's asinine list!

16:00.001 --> 16:02.880
I'm going home.

16:04.630 --> 16:07.053
Boy, Hank was a little dramatic,
don't you think?

16:07.049 --> 16:08.175
Yeah. It's sad,

16:08.176 --> 16:10.804
but some people thrive
on that sort of thing.

16:10.803 --> 16:12.146
Man, what, you kidding me, man?

16:12.305 --> 16:14.353
Talkin' 'bout ol' yak, yak, yak,
blah, blah, bluh.

16:14.348 --> 16:15.645
Just shut up, man.

16:15.641 --> 16:17.769
Dang ol', just got to do this
for Hank, man.

16:17.768 --> 16:18.940
It's about Hank, man.

16:20.813 --> 16:22.406
Hank,

16:22.398 --> 16:24.571
we've got something
we want to say.

16:24.567 --> 16:25.910
We apologize.

16:25.902 --> 16:27.154
And we want

16:27.153 --> 16:29.076
to help you finish
what we screwed up.

16:29.071 --> 16:31.199
We want to help flush Cotton
down the toilet.

16:32.366 --> 16:33.788
I don't even care anymore.

16:33.784 --> 16:35.912
And even if I did,
there's no way

16:35.912 --> 16:37.755
that bartender's
gonna let us back in.

16:37.747 --> 16:39.124
Don't worry about that.

16:39.123 --> 16:41.922
Cotton's going down that toilet
tonight.

16:41.918 --> 16:43.716
We have a plan.

16:43.711 --> 16:47.181
A plan that's going to distract
a whole bar full of people?

16:47.173 --> 16:49.096
It's not just a bar
full of people, Hank.

16:49.258 --> 16:52.432
It's a bar full of
military people.

16:54.972 --> 16:57.145
Yup, Vietnam.

16:57.141 --> 16:59.064
That was the toughest war
we ever fought.

16:59.060 --> 17:00.403
I heard that!

17:00.394 --> 17:04.648
At least we won ours,
you whiny dope smokers!

17:04.648 --> 17:07.152
World War ll was
the last great war!

17:07.318 --> 17:09.695
Man, the Russians did all
the dirty work for you guys.

17:09.694 --> 17:12.448
Now Desert Storm--
That was the real gut check.

17:12.448 --> 17:13.665
Desert Storm?

17:13.657 --> 17:15.877
You guys barely had time
to eat a falafel

17:15.867 --> 17:17.494
before you hightailed it
out of there.

17:17.494 --> 17:18.712
What abouts Grenada?

17:18.704 --> 17:20.547
Them medical students
was trapped!

17:20.540 --> 17:21.837
Come on, you guys!

17:21.832 --> 17:23.175
Remember the rules!

17:23.166 --> 17:24.089
Not my rules!

17:24.252 --> 17:25.469
Hell with the rules!

17:25.461 --> 17:26.713
I can't read!

17:40.184 --> 17:42.403
Hank,

17:42.395 --> 17:44.523
would you like to do the honors?

17:44.522 --> 17:46.149
Well, to be honest,

17:46.148 --> 17:48.196
I don't really have
anything nice to say.

17:48.192 --> 17:49.944
You go ahead, Dale.

17:49.944 --> 17:52.367
I think I've caused
enough trouble this week.

17:52.363 --> 17:54.206
Bill, why don't you?

17:54.198 --> 17:55.825
I don't deserve it, either.

17:55.825 --> 17:59.955
I'm embarrassed I got so upset
over a stupid beer can.

17:59.954 --> 18:02.082
And how I didn't help you, Hank.

18:02.081 --> 18:03.754
I'm sorry to both of you.

18:03.749 --> 18:05.126
I'm sorry, too, Hank.

18:05.293 --> 18:06.966
And I'm sorry, Bill.

18:06.961 --> 18:09.885
When we get back home,
I'll pick up the beer can.

18:09.880 --> 18:11.177
You don't have to.

18:11.173 --> 18:12.641
I want to.

18:24.478 --> 18:27.072
Uh, you know,

18:27.064 --> 18:30.068
I-I guess I did learn something
about Cotton this week.

18:30.067 --> 18:32.069
Sure, he killed 50 men,

18:32.069 --> 18:34.117
but he didn't do it alone.

18:34.113 --> 18:37.367
There were all kinds of Stinkies
and Fatties to help him.

18:37.366 --> 18:39.460
Those guys meant a lot
to Cotton,

18:39.452 --> 18:42.456
just like you guys, uh,
mean a lot to me.

18:44.165 --> 18:45.838
It's a shame we never got

18:45.833 --> 18:48.177
to experience the horrors
of war together,

18:48.169 --> 18:49.386
but that doesn't mean

18:49.378 --> 18:52.131
I don't enjoy our,
uh, time together.

18:54.175 --> 18:56.553
Well, I guess we should do this.

19:00.181 --> 19:03.105
Hold on a sec, Hank.

19:10.399 --> 19:12.401
Attention!

19:28.167 --> 19:31.546
Yup. I just got the bill
from the Chimney Pipe.

19:31.545 --> 19:35.800
I have to reimburse them $300
for that clogged toilet.

19:35.800 --> 19:38.178
I guess we just have
to accept the fact

19:38.177 --> 19:40.521
that even dead,
Cotton will always find a way

19:40.513 --> 19:42.186
to disrupt our lives.

19:42.181 --> 19:44.183
This one is on me.

19:44.183 --> 19:47.653
You know, Dad, you never
answered my questions about you.

19:47.645 --> 19:50.068
Well, you're right, Bobby.
What do you want to know?

19:50.064 --> 19:51.190
I'll tell you anything.

19:51.190 --> 19:53.192
How do you like
your hamburgers cooked?

19:53.192 --> 19:55.194
Medium rare. Three flips.

19:55.194 --> 19:57.162
Okay. What was it like

19:57.154 --> 19:59.657
the first time
you slept in a bed with Mom?

19:59.657 --> 20:01.876
How'd you choose which side

20:01.867 --> 20:03.335
of the bed you'd sleep on?

20:03.327 --> 20:05.170
And did you start cuddling
right away,

20:05.162 --> 20:07.130
or did you build up to it?

20:07.123 --> 20:09.171
Well, uh, okay.

20:09.166 --> 20:12.090
Uh, let's start
with the bed question.

20:12.253 --> 20:15.097
<i>Uh, I sleep on the north side.</i>

20:15.089 --> 20:17.091
<i>As for the cuddling, uh...</i>

20:18.884 --> 20:21.137
<i>Uh, Peggy, could you get me
some water?</i>

20:25.599 --> 20:27.351
Hello. I'm Hank Hill.

20:27.351 --> 20:31.197
Clogged toilets are a serious
issue that affects everyone.

20:31.188 --> 20:34.112
I'd like to take a moment
to give you a few pointers

20:34.275 --> 20:36.118
on proper toilet usage

20:36.110 --> 20:39.205
so what happened in this episode
won't happen to you.

20:39.196 --> 20:42.200
First off,
items like cotton swabs,

20:42.199 --> 20:43.701
chewing gum, cigarettes,

20:43.701 --> 20:47.831
and, uh, lady things
should not be flushed.

20:47.830 --> 20:49.173
The basic rule is,

20:49.165 --> 20:51.167
never flush anything
down a toilet

20:51.167 --> 20:54.637
that doesn't come directly,
uh, from you.

20:54.628 --> 20:56.426
For tougher clogs,

20:56.422 --> 20:58.800
purchase a snake
at a local hardware store,

20:58.799 --> 21:00.801
or consult your local
yellow pages

21:00.801 --> 21:03.680
for a certified plumber
in your area.

21:03.679 --> 21:05.898
If it's a father
and son company,

21:05.890 --> 21:07.358
request the father.

21:07.349 --> 21:09.351
And finally, I want you to know

21:09.351 --> 21:11.353
that no pipes
were actually damaged

21:11.353 --> 21:13.355
in the making of this episode.

21:13.355 --> 21:15.278
Thank you.

21:52.394 --> 21:55.318
<i>I killed 50 men!</i>
