00:02.560 --> 00:04.440
Would you want to grow up here?
I have to.

00:04.440 --> 00:06.720
I'm Alex Mack.

00:06.720 --> 00:10.880
I was just an average kid
until my first day of Junior High.

00:13.000 --> 00:16.840
One minute I'm walking home,
the next, there's a crash

00:16.840 --> 00:19.920
and I'm drench in some weird chemical.

00:20.760 --> 00:24.280
And since then...
nothing's been the same.

00:26.000 --> 00:32.073
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:37.800 --> 00:40.920
My best friend Ray
think it's cool.

00:40.920 --> 00:44.200
And my sister Annie
thinks I'm a science project.

00:45.080 --> 00:47.600
I can't let anyone else find out.

00:47.600 --> 00:49.920
Not even my parents.

00:51.360 --> 00:54.320
I know the Chemical Plant
wants to find me

00:54.320 --> 00:56.040
and turn me into some experiment.

00:56.040 --> 00:57.360
But you know something?

00:57.360 --> 01:01.040
I'm guess I'm not so average anymore.

01:06.320 --> 01:08.160
Career Day?
I'm only 13.

01:08.160 --> 01:09.880
How am I supposed to know

01:09.880 --> 01:12.560
what I want to do with
there of my life?

01:12.560 --> 01:15.600
You're not, this isn't
about choosing a career.

01:15.600 --> 01:18.440
It's about a corporation
trying to determine

01:18.440 --> 01:20.720
the direction of the rest of your life.

01:20.720 --> 01:22.600
I think it's a good idea.

01:22.600 --> 01:25.040
You're just mad
because they drafted you.

01:25.040 --> 01:27.280
Recruit Wilson,
Paradise Plant Police

01:27.280 --> 01:29.440
a memeber of the plant's finest.

01:29.440 --> 01:32.480
I have to memorize
this whole booklet by tomorrow.

01:32.480 --> 01:34.040
You think you're upset?

01:34.040 --> 01:36.840
Tomorrow I become
plant safety administrator.

01:36.840 --> 01:39.760
Someone is going to get hurt.

01:39.760 --> 01:42.880
I think I'm going to love
the job they gave me.

01:53.920 --> 01:56.560
Come on, Alex,
you're not concentrating.

01:56.560 --> 01:59.440
Excuse me if turning on
a blender isn't exactly

01:59.440 --> 02:02.320
how I want to spend
my last moments on earth.

02:02.320 --> 02:04.920
I don't understand
how you can't stay away

02:04.920 --> 02:06.560
from the Chemical Plant.

02:06.560 --> 02:08.759
You know how dangerous
it is for you.

02:08.759 --> 02:10.160
It's not my fault.

02:10.160 --> 02:12.600
It's 'cause the plant
controls the school.

02:12.600 --> 02:14.960
It controls the whole town.

02:14.960 --> 02:18.400
It's probably just another one
of Mom's P.R. shcemes

02:18.400 --> 02:21.760
to make Danielle look good.
Mom hasn't mentioned it.

02:21.760 --> 02:23.320
Anyways, I have to go.

02:23.320 --> 02:25.440
I even made the mistake
of asking

02:25.440 --> 02:28.960
if I could work with Dad
in research and development.

02:28.960 --> 02:31.600
I'm just going
to disappoint him again.

02:31.600 --> 02:32.920
Well, do your best.

02:32.920 --> 02:37.040
Maybe you have a future in science
that hasn't quite developed yet.

02:37.040 --> 02:39.560
- Yeah, right.
- Okay, look...

02:39.560 --> 02:43.720
Well, just be careful 'cause
you're going to be on their turf

02:43.720 --> 02:48.000
and you're going to be completely
vulnerable and defenseless.

02:49.600 --> 02:51.200
Ahh!

02:54.800 --> 02:57.360
[whirring and buzzing]

03:00.240 --> 03:03.640
Okay, so maybe defenseless
wasn't the right word.

03:03.640 --> 03:07.760
But be careful
and don't be a showoff.

03:08.640 --> 03:10.200
How are you?
How's everybody?

03:10.200 --> 03:12.720
Working at Paradise Valley
Chemical Plant

03:12.720 --> 03:15.120
will change your life as it has mine.

03:15.120 --> 03:17.440
Your chemicals are poisoning
the earth and will make it

03:17.440 --> 03:20.760
- uninhabitable.
- Thank you.

03:20.760 --> 03:23.960
She's right.
I hope you're happy.

03:23.960 --> 03:25.960
Very happy, thanks for asking.

03:25.960 --> 03:29.400
Bye, nice to see you.
Great to see you, come again.

03:29.400 --> 03:31.240
Thanks for coming.

03:45.600 --> 03:48.240
Vince, I love children.

03:48.240 --> 03:50.760
[breathing deeply]

03:51.640 --> 03:54.040
- I love children.
- I know that.

03:54.040 --> 03:56.800
How about the children
who called in sick?

03:56.800 --> 03:58.600
They're under investigation.

03:58.600 --> 04:00.480
Vince, when we find the child

04:00.480 --> 04:03.320
the rewards will far
outweigh your efforts.

04:03.320 --> 04:07.240
A successful mission for you
is reward enough, Miss Atron.

04:07.240 --> 04:10.640
- Thanks for participating.
- Anything to help the cause.

04:10.640 --> 04:13.560
Ready to go to work, Miss Atron?

04:27.520 --> 04:31.720
[Mr Mack] So, Ms. Mack,
have you detected a pattern yet?

04:31.720 --> 04:32.880
Definitely.

04:32.880 --> 04:35.200
That's great, Alex,
what do you see?

04:35.200 --> 04:40.360
That if you fold this computer
paper the wrong way...

04:41.120 --> 04:43.560
It makes a huge mess.

04:43.560 --> 04:46.600
Alex, are you bored already?

04:47.120 --> 04:49.240
No, Dad, not at all.

04:49.240 --> 04:51.520
Well, now it really gets interesting.

04:51.520 --> 04:53.880
We're going to set up
an experiment

04:53.880 --> 04:57.640
where we add this compound
to these test tubes heat them

04:57.640 --> 04:59.760
observe and record the results.

04:59.760 --> 05:02.120
That compound goes
in those test tubes

05:02.120 --> 05:04.640
and then you heat them?

05:04.640 --> 05:07.800
The experiment may be
a little complicated for you

05:07.800 --> 05:12.280
but when I'm done here
you can help me chart my results.

05:12.840 --> 05:14.720
We use colors and everything.

05:14.720 --> 05:17.480
I'm going to go get a soda
you want one?

05:17.480 --> 05:22.120
Well, I'll be right back
then we'll get started.

05:34.440 --> 05:36.400
Too complicated for me?

05:38.040 --> 05:40.520
We'll see about that.

05:52.480 --> 05:54.360
[zapping]

05:57.640 --> 05:59.520
[liquid bubbling]

06:08.800 --> 06:10.640
What are these for?

06:10.640 --> 06:13.720
Are you going to ask me
about everything here?

06:13.720 --> 06:14.720
Yes.

06:15.520 --> 06:20.960
I don't have time for this today.
These are safety goggles.

06:20.960 --> 06:27.040
Plant employees are required to
wear them to protect their eyes.

06:27.040 --> 06:29.680
From what?
A dull pencil?

06:29.680 --> 06:31.200
For your information

06:31.200 --> 06:34.560
these goggles were designed
by scientists at NASA.

06:34.560 --> 06:36.840
Behind them,
your eyes are safe

06:36.840 --> 06:39.440
from the sharpest
number two pencil

06:39.440 --> 06:42.280
or the most violent chemical explosion.

06:42.280 --> 06:46.200
But then who needs eyes
when your head's been blown off?

06:46.200 --> 06:48.760
I mean, a gas leak here,
a spill there

06:48.760 --> 06:51.880
this place could go up
like a matchbox.

06:57.280 --> 06:58.800
Ooh.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.120
Head up.

07:06.120 --> 07:08.440
Is that gum, recruit?

07:11.760 --> 07:16.400
Who can give me the numerical
code for a forced entry?

07:16.400 --> 07:19.320
- Wilson.
- Four-49er, sir.

07:19.320 --> 07:22.240
Good recruit,
how about a chemical spill?

07:22.240 --> 07:25.000
- Environmentally threatening?
- Never, recruit.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.280
- One-29er, sir.
- False alarm.

07:28.280 --> 07:30.880
- Three-59er.
- Smoke condition.

07:30.880 --> 07:33.040
- Six-59er.
- Mad dog!

07:33.040 --> 07:37.480
Two-89er...
Addendum D, Sir.

07:37.480 --> 07:39.840
Ha-ha, very good, recruit.

07:39.840 --> 07:42.200
Get back in line!

07:46.840 --> 07:49.000
[bubbling]

07:53.120 --> 07:55.200
Alex?

07:55.200 --> 07:58.520
You did that already?
By yourself?

07:58.520 --> 08:01.680
That's wonderful!
[kissing]

08:02.440 --> 08:05.120
Oh, gosh, um...
Dad, I'm sorry.

08:05.120 --> 08:08.880
I'll go get some paper towels.

08:08.880 --> 08:12.000
That's okay,
I'll just call the custodian.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.600
No, really, it was my fault.

08:14.600 --> 08:16.680
I'll be right back.

08:32.720 --> 08:38.400
[Vince] Dave, you realize that today
isn't reallt career day, right?

08:38.400 --> 08:39.480
No?

08:39.480 --> 08:43.080
No! We're making surveillance
tapes of all the kids here.

08:43.080 --> 08:45.320
Later, we're going to watch them.

08:45.320 --> 08:48.000
Maybe our problem child
will show himself

08:48.000 --> 08:51.440
by doing something unusual
in front of the cameras.

08:51.440 --> 08:54.040
Or maybe you'll finally
recognize him.

08:54.040 --> 08:56.200
I'll do my best, Vince.

08:56.200 --> 08:58.400
Ah, well, now I can relax.

08:58.400 --> 09:02.360
Either way, it all ends here.
The game is over.

09:02.360 --> 09:06.000
Today, the chemical kid
pays the piper.

09:17.960 --> 09:23.160
I got big ideas
for this place, Danielle.

09:23.160 --> 09:26.480
Oh, may I call you Danielle?

09:26.480 --> 09:29.000
No, you may not.

09:32.160 --> 09:33.960
Excuse me.

09:33.960 --> 09:37.920
Who do you think
you're talking to, my friend?

09:37.920 --> 09:41.640
Plant dress code?
Your shoes could be shined.

09:41.640 --> 09:43.600
Your hair could be cut.

09:43.600 --> 09:48.760
And you could probably iron
your uniform a little bit better.

09:48.760 --> 09:51.160
Miss Atron,
this child's for real?

09:51.160 --> 09:54.480
I'm afraid he's right.
Consider this your final warning.

09:54.480 --> 09:56.360
Yes, Miss Atron.

10:03.320 --> 10:04.080
Oh!

10:06.000 --> 10:08.080
They're everywhere.

10:08.080 --> 10:11.720
- Alex!
- I'm okay, Ray.

10:11.720 --> 10:14.080
You should watch where you're going.

10:14.080 --> 10:17.200
- Are you okay, Danielle?
- Are you okay, Miss Atron?

10:17.200 --> 10:21.360
I'm fine, but she looks like she
could use your help, Mr. Aloe Vera.

10:21.360 --> 10:23.600
That's Alvarado.

10:27.720 --> 10:28.800
Danielle?

10:31.080 --> 10:33.680
We're like this.

10:33.680 --> 10:35.760
Ray, I have to tell you something.

10:35.760 --> 10:40.160
I'm really digging this C.E.O. stuff.
It's definitely a job with perks.

10:40.160 --> 10:42.240
I have a huge desk,
I'll show you.

10:42.240 --> 10:44.600
- Come on, let's go.
- But, Ray!

10:44.600 --> 10:47.000
[buzzing and humming]

10:47.720 --> 10:50.680
I'll need to take a sample
and get it to the lab.

10:50.680 --> 10:53.120
The entire room
might be contaminated.

10:53.120 --> 10:55.960
Do you know what this stuff
does to a tooth

10:55.960 --> 10:58.520
- when left in overnight?
- I saw we evacuate.

10:58.520 --> 11:01.680
I have a feeling
we should be very careful here.

11:01.680 --> 11:04.320
Mr. Mack, you'll have
to evacuate the office

11:04.320 --> 11:07.760
- until the results come back.
- It's just soda, Hedwig.

11:07.760 --> 11:11.080
Let the experts
be the judge of that, Mr. Mack.

11:12.520 --> 11:13.240
But...

11:16.160 --> 11:18.920
One day,
this will all be mine.

11:21.760 --> 11:23.240
Whoa!

11:23.760 --> 11:26.360
Ray, you're not
even listening to me.

11:26.360 --> 11:29.160
[Miss Atron]
Come into my office, Vince.

11:29.160 --> 11:32.040
I need to get away
from that El Dorado kid

11:32.040 --> 11:33.760
they stuck me with.

11:37.480 --> 11:40.080
You can cross Avocado off the list.

11:40.080 --> 11:42.640
Unless GC-161 makes you
terribly annoying

11:42.640 --> 11:45.760
there's nothing extraordinary
about that kid.

11:45.760 --> 11:48.280
[Vince]
I'll screen tapes from accounting

11:48.280 --> 11:50.400
through research and development.

11:50.400 --> 11:54.120
- Chair problem, Miss Atron?
- I hate it when it won't roll.

11:54.120 --> 11:56.760
Let me take a look at that for you.

12:06.040 --> 12:07.520
[phone rings]

12:08.600 --> 12:11.200
Vince.
That won't be necessary.

12:11.200 --> 12:15.320
Miss Atron is here with me.
Uh-huh, I'll let her know.

12:15.320 --> 12:18.320
We have a situation
in human resources.

12:18.320 --> 12:21.040
I'll radio maintenance
about your chair.

12:28.480 --> 12:31.160
See, did you hear that?

12:31.960 --> 12:35.640
- Yeah, she thinks I'm annoying.
- No, they're taping us.

12:35.640 --> 12:38.360
It's what I've been trying to tell you.

12:38.360 --> 12:41.200
So what? It's not like
you're dumb enough

12:41.200 --> 12:43.560
to use your powers in here.

13:20.840 --> 13:22.680
Freeze!

13:28.680 --> 13:31.320
We've been looking for you,
young lady.

13:31.320 --> 13:34.760
- You have?
- Lights!

13:34.760 --> 13:37.200
Wilson, what are we looking at?

13:37.200 --> 13:41.360
We're looking at a violation
of code 144.3, paragraph two:

13:41.360 --> 13:44.760
"standing on unbolted
office furniture."

13:44.760 --> 13:46.680
[clicks tongue]

13:46.680 --> 13:50.000
Now, are you going
to get down off that chair

13:50.000 --> 13:52.280
or will I have to come and get you?

13:52.280 --> 13:57.080
Come on, Alex, get down.
Make a hole!

13:59.000 --> 14:01.160
That's it?

14:01.160 --> 14:04.960
It was your first violation
and you've received a warning.

14:04.960 --> 14:07.120
Vince is strict but he's fair.

14:10.840 --> 14:14.080
It looks like the loading dock
is the best way in.

14:14.080 --> 14:17.240
- Are you serious?
- You have a better idea?

14:17.240 --> 14:20.560
It does seen dangerous.
I'm disappointed in Dani.

14:20.560 --> 14:24.000
I can't believe she'll pull
something like that.

14:24.720 --> 14:26.720
- Dani?
- Dani?

14:26.720 --> 14:29.040
Alex, you're the one
I can't believe.

14:29.040 --> 14:32.720
Right, I'm sorry.
I just wanted to impress Dad.

14:32.720 --> 14:34.240
Getting the videotape

14:34.240 --> 14:37.600
ought to be the most impressive
thing you've ever done.

14:37.600 --> 14:40.880
Don't forget to unlock
the kitchen door.

14:40.880 --> 14:43.160
And don't be late.

14:44.880 --> 14:45.960
[humming]

14:49.520 --> 14:51.880
Wouldn't be movies
without popcorn.

14:51.880 --> 14:54.400
As usual, Dave, you're confused.

14:54.400 --> 14:57.760
We're not watching movies.
No.

14:57.760 --> 15:02.960
We're trying to find the kid
that you spilled the Chemical on.

15:02.960 --> 15:05.920
You've never forgiven me
for that, have you?

15:25.200 --> 15:27.160
[soft]:
Synchronize.

15:27.160 --> 15:29.520
- Ready?
- Ready.

15:29.520 --> 15:32.280
- [watchbeeping]
- Let's move out.

15:36.040 --> 15:39.680
Did you get the information
from Nicole we needed?

15:39.680 --> 15:42.840
I did better than that.
I convinced her to lend me

15:42.840 --> 15:45.120
Vince's infrared
night-vision goggles

15:45.120 --> 15:48.000
so we can see in the dark
if we have to.

15:48.000 --> 15:51.320
It helps to know people
in high places.

15:51.320 --> 15:53.640
- [sneers]
- [sneers]

16:02.200 --> 16:04.240
[brakes squeaking]

16:04.240 --> 16:06.000
Shh!

16:09.480 --> 16:14.080
- How will we get past this guy?
- [Ray] No problem.

16:14.080 --> 16:16.560
I got the scoop on him.

16:16.560 --> 16:19.640
Nicole says
he's impossible to get by.

16:19.640 --> 16:22.520
Except between
7:30 and 8:00 P.M.

16:22.520 --> 16:25.920
It's his favorite TV show.

16:25.920 --> 16:27.920
Let's get ready to move.

16:27.920 --> 16:30.800
Move out!

16:50.400 --> 16:52.280
Looks like you're up, Alex.

16:52.280 --> 16:54.600
We get past these guys
and we're in.

17:00.320 --> 17:03.840
[men yelling]

17:12.079 --> 17:13.760
Roger, top dog.

17:13.760 --> 17:17.319
- [imitates CB radio crackle]
- This is big man, do you copy?

17:17.319 --> 17:20.079
Dave, if you can't pay attention

17:20.079 --> 17:24.240
I'm going to have to take
that away from you.

17:24.240 --> 17:26.240
I'm sorry, Vince.

17:44.200 --> 17:46.160
Let's lift her.

17:50.760 --> 17:53.000
[zapping]

17:54.800 --> 17:57.080
They're watching the tapes.

17:57.080 --> 18:00.360
We don't know when
they're going to get to yours.

18:00.360 --> 18:02.920
Hopefully sooner than later.

18:04.640 --> 18:09.360
Alex, I can't see anything.
This guy's blocking the TV.

18:09.360 --> 18:11.680
[Alex]
Ray, get down.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.080
[zapping]

18:18.920 --> 18:21.280
[laughs]

18:25.600 --> 18:28.400
Ah, Ms. Mack.
How do you do?

18:28.400 --> 18:31.040
I'm George Mack.
Welcome to my office.

18:31.040 --> 18:33.600
This is it, you guys!

18:36.200 --> 18:40.240
Go.
Here, take these.

18:53.600 --> 18:57.040
All right, I'm going in.

18:57.040 --> 18:59.080
[zapping]

19:00.680 --> 19:03.880
[computer voice]
System failure, system failure...

19:03.880 --> 19:07.840
System failure?
Vince, what's happening?

19:07.840 --> 19:11.200
The power went out, Dave.
Everything's fine.

19:11.200 --> 19:15.160
- System failure, system failure...
- [alarm buzzing]

19:15.160 --> 19:19.440
System failure, system failure,
system failure...

19:19.440 --> 19:22.840
[Dave crying]
It's a meltdown, it's a meltdown!

19:22.840 --> 19:24.160
Dave, calm down.

19:24.160 --> 19:27.240
This is a chemical plant,
not a nuclear reactor.

19:27.240 --> 19:31.040
- Now, where is the walkie-talkie?
- I don't remember.

19:31.040 --> 19:34.840
Well, where is it?
You were playing with it last.

19:36.520 --> 19:39.600
Dave, sit down and
stay out of my way.

19:39.600 --> 19:41.200
I am sitting.

19:45.320 --> 19:47.440
- [zapping]
- Let's go!

19:47.440 --> 19:51.200
- [Annie] Okay, follow me.
- [Ray] Right behind you.

19:51.200 --> 19:53.720
[alarm buzzing]

20:09.560 --> 20:11.480
Go ahead, Alex.

20:11.480 --> 20:14.960
Really?
I feel sorry for these guys.

20:14.960 --> 20:18.200
Go ahead, Alex!
Go ahead, Alex!

20:22.520 --> 20:25.880
[Man]
Don't look at me.

20:25.880 --> 20:28.040
Someone else put them there.

20:28.040 --> 20:29.920
I didn't do it.

20:38.480 --> 20:39.680
Get down!

20:39.680 --> 20:41.560
I'm on this job ten years.

20:41.560 --> 20:44.360
Has anybody ever
gotten by me before?

20:44.360 --> 20:48.200
- Have they?
- We got to get out of here.

20:49.240 --> 20:52.200
I think I know a way.

20:53.720 --> 20:55.720
Don't get defensive with me.

20:55.720 --> 20:58.840
- Just keep your eyes open.
- I always do.

20:58.840 --> 21:03.560
I do my job better than any punk
on your entire wimpy force.

21:03.560 --> 21:05.400
Oh, you know, you're the best.

21:05.400 --> 21:08.520
Except between the hours
of 7:30 and 8:00, huh?

21:08.520 --> 21:12.080
My one vice.
Beat me up over my one vice.

21:12.080 --> 21:16.520
- Just do your job, Gino.
- I always do, Vince.

21:24.640 --> 21:27.800
Alex... concentrate.

21:27.800 --> 21:31.240
- [zapping]
- [engine starts]

21:34.120 --> 21:36.280
[tires squealing]

21:38.160 --> 21:38.910
Oh!

21:40.840 --> 21:43.800
Somebody stop that vehicle!

21:44.880 --> 21:46.800
Hurry!

21:49.720 --> 21:51.920
Let's move, now!

22:02.600 --> 22:05.360
[Vince shouting]
Stop that vehicle!

22:05.360 --> 22:07.440
That's my humvee!

22:13.480 --> 22:16.320
[chuckling]

22:16.320 --> 22:19.320
[owl hooting]

22:34.640 --> 22:36.280
[stairs creak]

22:36.280 --> 22:39.240
Where are you girls
coming from?

22:39.240 --> 22:41.160
Um...

22:42.680 --> 22:44.480
The video store.

22:46.560 --> 22:48.120
Alex...

22:48.120 --> 22:51.560
I just want you to know
how proud I am of you.

22:51.560 --> 22:55.480
- What are you talking about?
- You know, on career day?

22:55.480 --> 22:58.040
It was great to have you around.

22:58.040 --> 23:00.320
I know how you feel
about science

23:00.320 --> 23:03.200
and that you did it
just to make me happy.

23:03.200 --> 23:05.000
It was no big deal, Dad.

23:05.000 --> 23:09.360
Actually, it was more exciting
than I thought it was going to be.

23:09.360 --> 23:11.240
[chuckling]

23:11.240 --> 23:14.280
You girls want to watch
that tape down here?

23:14.280 --> 23:16.040
I don't think so, Dad.

23:16.040 --> 23:19.200
I don't think you're
quite ready for it yet.
