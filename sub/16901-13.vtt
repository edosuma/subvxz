WEBVTT

00:02.869 --> 00:04.131
Mr. Geiss, I'm so sorry.

00:04.270 --> 00:05.760
I just found out
that you're here.

00:05.905 --> 00:08.339
I'd have my assistant sit
on his naughty stool

00:08.475 --> 00:09.737
if he didn't love it
so much.

00:09.876 --> 00:10.968
No apologies.

00:11.111 --> 00:13.739
I was just admiring
your "Bulb" cover.

00:13.880 --> 00:15.939
Thank you, sir.
Why don't you, uh...

00:16.082 --> 00:18.448
Are you all right?

00:18.585 --> 00:19.916
It's the diabetes.

00:20.053 --> 00:22.044
I'm light-headed
all the time.

00:22.188 --> 00:23.519
I can't see a damn thing.

00:23.656 --> 00:24.554
We're all getting older,
sir.

00:24.691 --> 00:25.555
Tell me about it.

00:25.692 --> 00:27.353
My baby girl
is getting married.

00:27.494 --> 00:30.019
<i>She and her fiancé are out</i>

00:30.163 --> 00:33.132
choosing floral arrangements
right now.

00:33.266 --> 00:35.234
Fire Island, really?

00:35.368 --> 00:37.700
Love to come out,
fight the surf together,

00:37.837 --> 00:39.532
light a fire,
check each other for ticks.

00:39.672 --> 00:40.661
Ooh.

00:40.807 --> 00:44.208
Kathy, I think I just found the
perfect place for our honeymoon.

00:44.344 --> 00:46.812
You're getting
a fine son-in-law, sir.

00:46.946 --> 00:49.608
Banks would do... anything
for the company.

00:49.749 --> 00:52.183
I know there's no love lost
between you and Devin.

00:52.318 --> 00:54.616
You've both been competing
for my job for almost a year,

00:54.754 --> 00:55.880
hanging in there

00:56.022 --> 00:58.855
while so many others cracked
under the pressure,

00:58.992 --> 01:00.391
like Bob Duncan.

01:00.527 --> 01:03.394
The head of the Stress Ball
Division hanged himself.

01:03.530 --> 01:06.397
Now it's come down
to you and Banks.

01:06.533 --> 01:08.398
This decision was not easy,
Jack.

01:08.535 --> 01:10.435
Banks is joining my family.

01:10.570 --> 01:14.006
I understand, sir.

01:15.642 --> 01:18.941
But I'm not running a family.
I'm running a business!

01:19.079 --> 01:21.445
So I'm going with you!
Congratulations!

01:21.581 --> 01:22.980
You're going to run
this company!

01:23.116 --> 01:26.017
Oh, my God!

01:26.152 --> 01:27.312
Oh, thank you!

01:27.454 --> 01:29.888
I told myself
I wasn't going to do this.

01:30.023 --> 01:31.752
Oh, happy day!

01:31.891 --> 01:33.051
It's all right.

01:33.193 --> 01:36.287
You get one cry in life.
You've chosen well.

01:36.429 --> 01:38.056
When will this be made public,
sir?

01:38.198 --> 01:40.132
I want my mother to know
before she dies

01:40.266 --> 01:42.166
so she goes to her grave
a defeated woman.

01:42.302 --> 01:44.793
Well, only the two of us
can know now.

01:44.938 --> 01:46.803
I've got to present it
to the board.

01:46.940 --> 01:49.340
You've got to get your successor
in place.

01:49.476 --> 01:51.034
I've got a short list ready.

01:51.177 --> 01:52.542
Well, word of advice...

01:52.679 --> 01:55.512
Whoever you chose has got to be
someone you trust.

01:55.648 --> 01:58.811
I guess that rules out
the Federal Reserve.

02:00.000 --> 02:06.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:21.574 --> 02:23.132
What do you
want me to do, Liz?

02:23.276 --> 02:25.335
Oh, you idiot,
with your stupid face!

02:25.478 --> 02:28.379
You look like Gene Simmons
had sex with a basset hound!

02:28.515 --> 02:30.346
Not cool, Liz.
It's your fault!

02:30.483 --> 02:32.849
Oh, it's my fault
that we pulled an all-nighter

02:32.986 --> 02:35.011
and then you lost
the entire script

02:35.155 --> 02:37.680
because you downloaded a virus
on my computer?

02:37.824 --> 02:40.850
First of all, the subject of the
e- mail was "Check this out. "

02:40.994 --> 02:42.962
You expect me
not to open that?

02:43.096 --> 02:44.393
And second of all,
it is your fault,

02:44.531 --> 02:46.499
because if you hadn't
created this show,

02:46.633 --> 02:47.691
we wouldn't even be here!

02:47.834 --> 02:49.165
Yeah, Liz sucks!

02:49.302 --> 02:49.961
Boo.

02:50.103 --> 02:51.934
Do you think this is
where I wanted to end up?

02:52.071 --> 02:53.231
I had dreams!

02:53.373 --> 02:55.102
I was gonna live
with the gorillas!

02:57.877 --> 03:00.710
Is it the 8 of diamonds?

03:00.847 --> 03:01.677
Nope.

03:02.515 --> 03:04.847
Pay attention to me!
I'm inconsolable!

03:04.984 --> 03:06.508
Uh-oh.
What happened, Tray?

03:06.653 --> 03:09.087
Tracy Jr. Left his music stick
at home.

03:09.222 --> 03:10.189
His flute.

03:10.323 --> 03:11.756
So I drove to the school
to give it to him,

03:11.891 --> 03:13.654
and guess what I discovered!

03:13.793 --> 03:15.590
Excuse me. I...

03:19.299 --> 03:22.393
He didn't invite you to
Bring Your Dad to School Day?

03:22.535 --> 03:24.059
What did you do, sir?

03:26.339 --> 03:30.605
If I'm such a bad dad,
why are we all dancing?

03:33.346 --> 03:35.541
My own son
is ashamed of his father.

03:35.682 --> 03:37.081
That's horrible.

03:37.217 --> 03:39.242
Everyone knows the only thing
we should be ashamed of

03:39.385 --> 03:40.477
is our bodies.

03:42.255 --> 03:44.416
They think I'm a joke 'cause
I clown around for a living.

03:44.557 --> 03:46.115
I got to do something important

03:46.259 --> 03:48.090
so that my children
will respect me,

03:48.228 --> 03:50.025
like be a senator or a wizard.

03:50.163 --> 03:52.631
Or you could open a school
in Africa like Oprah.

03:52.765 --> 03:54.255
Everybody, calm down!

03:55.668 --> 03:59.297
Think of an idea... something
that will change the world.

04:00.873 --> 04:01.965
Eureka!

04:02.108 --> 04:02.767
What is it, Tray?

04:02.909 --> 04:05.571
We should call Eureka.
She always has good ideas.

04:09.015 --> 04:11.575
Lemon!

04:11.718 --> 04:12.707
Lemon, are you in there?

04:12.852 --> 04:15.514
Oh! Jack, I was just reading
about gorilla researchers

04:15.655 --> 04:18.522
for a sketch we're doing,
making fun of them...

04:18.658 --> 04:20.091
for devoting their lives
to the jungle

04:20.226 --> 04:22.125
and its noble inhabitants.

04:22.262 --> 04:24.287
Lemon, I want to share a secret
with you.

04:24.430 --> 04:26.864
I spoke with Don Geiss.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.527
A few days from now, it will be
officially announced...

04:31.571 --> 04:33.266
...that I am the next chairman
of GE.

04:34.540 --> 04:36.770
Oh, my God!
Congratulations!

04:36.909 --> 04:39.935
Oh... hugging.

04:40.079 --> 04:41.444
So ethnic.

04:41.581 --> 04:43.446
Why don't we, uh...

04:43.583 --> 04:45.107
Well, I still
have to be approved,

04:45.251 --> 04:47.014
but that's just
a formality.

04:47.153 --> 04:48.643
Geiss has stacked
the board of directors

04:48.788 --> 04:49.755
with the most
reliable collection

04:49.889 --> 04:51.117
of sycophantic yes-men

04:51.257 --> 04:52.815
this side of an Al Franken
book signing...

04:52.959 --> 04:54.950
his golf cronies,
his Army buddies,

04:55.094 --> 04:56.755
various unemployable
family members,

04:56.896 --> 04:58.363
and his hunting dogs.

04:58.498 --> 05:00.022
The board won't be
a problem.

05:00.166 --> 05:01.861
Well, again,
congratulations.

05:02.001 --> 05:05.630
Why do I smell self-tanning
cream and teeth whitener?

05:07.140 --> 05:09.665
Banks.

05:09.809 --> 05:10.434
Hi, Jack.

05:10.576 --> 05:11.873
Devin.

05:12.011 --> 05:13.569
Once they cast Clay Aiken
in "Spamalot,"

05:13.713 --> 05:15.681
I knew it was only a matter of
time before you showed up here.

05:15.815 --> 05:18.340
Oh, when I'm living here
and running this company,

05:18.484 --> 05:22.750
I'll go see him every week,
until "Spamalot" closes...

05:22.889 --> 05:25.187
or he leaves the show.

05:25.325 --> 05:28.317
Oh, I almost forgot.

05:28.461 --> 05:29.860
I'm having my bachelor party
tomorrow night.

05:29.996 --> 05:31.361
Bachelor party?
Indeed.

05:31.497 --> 05:33.658
The hottest girls
from New York's top boob shacks

05:33.800 --> 05:34.994
are removing
their brassieres.

05:35.134 --> 05:36.726
And I kind of want to
get to know my new home,

05:36.869 --> 05:39.667
so I'm gonna have the party here
on the "TGS" stage.

05:39.806 --> 05:41.433
On my stage?
No way!

05:41.574 --> 05:44.441
Oh, hey, there, little guy.

05:44.577 --> 05:46.408
What the hell?
We have rehearsal.

05:46.546 --> 05:47.774
I'm gonna tell him he can't...
No, no, no, no, no, no.

05:47.914 --> 05:51.077
The most important thing is to know who
you can trust and who you can't trust,

05:51.217 --> 05:53.185
and that man
cannot be trusted.

05:53.319 --> 05:54.843
What are you worrying about?
You have the job.

05:54.987 --> 05:56.079
It's not over
till it's over.

05:56.222 --> 05:58.087
The game is still on.

05:58.224 --> 06:00.351
Nobody plays it
like Banks.

06:01.828 --> 06:04.262
Stay clear of him,
little buddy.

06:06.566 --> 06:09.399
Then, after you carbonate it,
you drink it.

06:09.535 --> 06:11.332
Sounds like soda pop.

06:11.471 --> 06:12.267
Damn it!

06:12.405 --> 06:14.737
Why is leaving your children
a legacy that'll live forever

06:14.874 --> 06:15.841
so hard?

06:15.975 --> 06:17.499
It's been
almost half an hour!

06:17.643 --> 06:19.736
Maybe we should take a break,
Mr. Jordan.

06:19.879 --> 06:22.973
Yeah, I need to clear
my thoughtsicles.

06:25.418 --> 06:29.218
Which one of my two favorite
pastimes shall I indulge in?

06:29.355 --> 06:32.256
Video games or pornography?

06:37.029 --> 06:38.291
That's it!

06:38.431 --> 06:41.491
Make a porn video game!

06:56.382 --> 06:58.247
Hey, Liz.

06:58.384 --> 06:59.578
It is Liz, right?

06:59.719 --> 07:00.743
Mm-hmm.

07:00.887 --> 07:02.252
Where's your buddy Jack?

07:02.388 --> 07:03.719
Packing up his office?

07:03.856 --> 07:05.448
I don't know anything
about Jack,

07:05.591 --> 07:07.286
so you're wasting
your time.

07:07.427 --> 07:08.291
Huh.

07:08.428 --> 07:11.659
So, you don't know about him
accidentally selling NBC

07:11.798 --> 07:12.662
to some Germans?

07:12.799 --> 07:14.391
Uh, no.

07:14.534 --> 07:15.933
Really?

07:16.068 --> 07:18.332
'Cause rumor has it that he's
trying to pull a death spiral,

07:18.471 --> 07:21.372
inflating the company's value,
shorting his own stock,

07:21.507 --> 07:22.405
and then making a killing.

07:22.542 --> 07:24.703
What?
No, that's completely not true.

07:24.844 --> 07:26.471
Jack was nowhere near
that meeting.

07:26.612 --> 07:27.840
He wasn't even
in New York,

07:27.980 --> 07:29.777
'cause he was off
with his girlfriend,

07:29.916 --> 07:31.247
leaving me in charge.

07:31.384 --> 07:34.751
So, take that... Liz.

07:34.887 --> 07:36.514
Oh, God.

07:36.656 --> 07:37.816
That was so easy.

07:37.957 --> 07:39.788
Like taking candy
from one of those guys

07:39.926 --> 07:41.484
who gives out candy
at gay nightclubs.

07:41.627 --> 07:43.060
Oh, my God,
please don't say anything.

07:43.196 --> 07:44.322
I'll give you Kenneth.

07:48.167 --> 07:50.135
Well,
as enticing as that is,

07:50.269 --> 07:51.930
I'm straight now,

07:52.071 --> 07:53.936
and I think
that my future father-in-law

07:54.073 --> 07:57.668
needs to hear about Jack's
little... career killer.

07:57.810 --> 07:59.368
Well, then he'll also
need to know

07:59.512 --> 08:01.070
about
the security-camera footage

08:01.214 --> 08:03.375
of you cheating on his daughter
with another woman.

08:03.516 --> 08:06.076
What?

08:08.287 --> 08:09.311
No.

08:09.455 --> 08:10.717
No! No!

08:10.857 --> 08:12.188
God! Ew!

08:12.325 --> 08:15.317
Oh, God! God!

08:15.461 --> 08:17.156
Ugh!

08:17.296 --> 08:19.787
You loved it!

08:19.932 --> 08:21.900
A porn video game?
It can't be done.

08:22.034 --> 08:24.867
Look, Tray, history's greatest
perverts have tried...

08:25.004 --> 08:27.131
Walt Disney, Larry Flynt,
the Japanese.

08:27.273 --> 08:29.639
But they can't do it
because of the uncanny valley.

08:29.775 --> 08:32.073
Let me show you something.
Check out this chart.

08:32.211 --> 08:35.078
You see, as artificial
representations of humans

08:35.214 --> 08:36.613
become more and more
realistic,

08:36.749 --> 08:37.647
they reach a point

08:37.783 --> 08:39.842
where they stop being endearing
and become creepy.

08:39.986 --> 08:41.419
Tell it to me in "Star Wars. "

08:41.554 --> 08:44.489
All right,
we like R2-D2 and C-3PO.

08:44.624 --> 08:45.591
They're nice.

08:45.725 --> 08:48.193
And, up here, we have
a real person, like Han Solo.

08:48.327 --> 08:50.659
He acts like he doesn't care,
but he does.

08:50.796 --> 08:53.196
But, down here,
we have a CGI stormtrooper

08:53.332 --> 08:55.027
or Tom Hanks
in "The Polar Express. "

08:55.167 --> 08:57.032
I'm scared!
Get me out of there!

08:57.169 --> 08:58.067
And that's the problem.

08:58.204 --> 09:00.263
You're in the valley now,
and it's impossible to get out.

09:00.406 --> 09:02.033
That's where you're wrong.

09:02.174 --> 09:03.835
I was born to design
a video game

09:03.976 --> 09:06.536
where characters get weird with
each other for golden points.

09:06.679 --> 09:08.670
My genius
will not be denied.

09:08.814 --> 09:10.179
I'm like Mozart.

09:10.316 --> 09:13.080
You're like that guy that was
always jealous of Mozart.

09:13.219 --> 09:13.947
Salieri?

09:14.086 --> 09:16.452
No, thank you.
Already ate.

09:16.589 --> 09:18.489
You will not deter me.

09:18.624 --> 09:22.390
The world is gonna remember
the name Tracy Jordan.

09:30.436 --> 09:33.428
Wow.
Well played, Lemon.

09:33.573 --> 09:35.598
To get through it,
I pretended he was a sandwich.

09:35.741 --> 09:37.072
It's good to have you
in my corner.

09:37.209 --> 09:39.404
Hey, you know,
I've always got your back.

09:42.181 --> 09:44.411
Uh, Lemon...

09:44.550 --> 09:47.041
where do you see yourself
in five years?

09:47.186 --> 09:50.622
Realistically? Um,
teaching improv on cruise ships.

09:50.756 --> 09:52.451
Lemon, I'm promoting you

09:52.592 --> 09:56.153
to head of East Coast Television
and Microwave Oven Programming.

09:56.295 --> 09:57.387
What?

09:57.530 --> 09:59.464
When did you get
microwaves back?

09:59.599 --> 10:01.260
You're going to be
my successor.

10:01.400 --> 10:03.630
No!
No, no, I'm not an executive.

10:03.769 --> 10:05.498
Executives are like,
"Huh, uh, uh!"

10:05.638 --> 10:07.401
And I'm like,
Ha ha ha la la la la?

10:07.540 --> 10:09.030
I mean, I'm...
I'm a creative person.

10:09.175 --> 10:10.972
Sure, there are times
when my job is frustrating,

10:11.110 --> 10:14.011
like when Lutz calls in sick
with March Madness,

10:14.146 --> 10:15.579
but I mostly love it.

10:15.715 --> 10:17.546
This is
the starting salary.

10:21.654 --> 10:23.986
Suck it, monkeys!
I'm going corporate!

10:28.227 --> 10:30.889
Word is, the board is meeting
later this week.

10:31.030 --> 10:32.622
Geiss must be close
to making a decision.

10:32.765 --> 10:34.096
I wouldn't know anything
about that.

10:34.233 --> 10:37.031
Hey, guys, let's change
the subject to sucking at golf

10:37.169 --> 10:38.761
so Donaghy has something
to talk about.

10:41.173 --> 10:42.868
I'm sorry about that.
I'm a little nervous.

10:43.009 --> 10:44.704
Don't apologize.
You're a natural.

10:44.844 --> 10:46.209
I'm feeling pretty drunk.

10:46.345 --> 10:48.176
Well, it's business drunk.
It's like rich drunk.

10:48.314 --> 10:49.508
Either way,
it's legal to drive.

10:49.649 --> 10:52.015
All right, gentlemen,
we should do some work.

10:52.151 --> 10:53.311
Boo!

10:53.452 --> 10:54.476
You suck, Stan!

10:56.656 --> 10:57.918
As you know,
we've sunk a lot of money

10:58.057 --> 11:00.651
into developing this new
microwave "start" button.

11:00.793 --> 11:02.886
It's been 4 years
and $10 million.

11:03.029 --> 11:04.223
I think it's time
we pull the trigger.

11:04.363 --> 11:06.024
What do you think?

11:06.165 --> 11:07.325
I kind of like
the old button.

11:07.466 --> 11:09.195
Button Classic.
I love it.

11:09.335 --> 11:11.530
Button Classic?
That's fantastic!

11:11.671 --> 11:13.662
Oh, my God, guys,
we are crushing it.

11:14.874 --> 11:16.603
Your first
executive decision,

11:16.742 --> 11:17.731
and you've already saved
this company

11:17.877 --> 11:19.367
$2 million
in future R&D.

11:19.512 --> 11:20.536
But what if I'm wrong?

11:20.680 --> 11:21.942
There is no wrong.

11:22.081 --> 11:24.140
Lemon, you just have to find
a subordinate

11:24.283 --> 11:25.716
you can push
the blame onto.

11:25.851 --> 11:27.182
That's why I love
Jorgenson here.

11:30.356 --> 11:31.914
I think you're ready to meet
the old man.

11:32.058 --> 11:34.652
Geez, Jack, offer to buy a girl
dinner first.

11:34.794 --> 11:35.988
Classic Lemon.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.328
I've never seen you like this,
Mr. Jordan.

11:43.469 --> 11:45.403
This project
is consuming you.

11:45.538 --> 11:48.336
No, for the first time
in my life, I know my purpose.

11:48.474 --> 11:51.068
I'm doing this
for my children.

11:51.210 --> 11:55.203
My genius has come alive, like
toys when your back is turned.

11:55.347 --> 11:57.838
I see the potential for erotica
in everything around me.

11:57.983 --> 12:01.419
This cup, this table.
Even you, Kenneth.

12:01.554 --> 12:03.954
Well, I am wearing
a cuffed trouser today.

12:04.090 --> 12:05.955
Tracy, what are you doing?
They need you in wardrobe!

12:06.092 --> 12:07.923
I'm inventing a porn video game!

12:08.060 --> 12:10.392
Let this man work!
No one is to disturb him!

12:10.529 --> 12:12.429
Don't hold your breath, Pete.
It can't be done.

12:12.565 --> 12:14.123
Or else I would have solved it
a long time ago.

12:15.434 --> 12:16.958
<i>Yeah, I would have.</i>

12:23.442 --> 12:26.036
Hey, nerds,
guess who's got two thumbs,

12:26.178 --> 12:29.011
speaks limited French,
and hasn't cried once today.

12:29.148 --> 12:30.137
This moi.

12:31.951 --> 12:32.815
Liz.

12:32.952 --> 12:33.748
Hi.

12:33.886 --> 12:36.116
You can't be serious
about going off with Donaghy.

12:36.255 --> 12:37.813
How can you abandon me
like this?

12:37.957 --> 12:39.584
No. I'm gonna promote you
out of here.

12:39.725 --> 12:41.056
You're gonna be
an executive.

12:41.193 --> 12:42.626
I don't want to be
an executive.

12:42.762 --> 12:45.959
This is
your starting salary.

12:57.777 --> 13:01.008
Uh, Don?
I'd like you to meet Liz Lemon.

13:01.147 --> 13:04.947
Aren't you the gal who pioneered
the Button Classic campaign?

13:05.084 --> 13:05.778
That was me.

13:05.918 --> 13:08.512
Where the hell
has Donaghy been hiding you?

13:08.654 --> 13:10.087
Oh,
my blood sugar is dropping.

13:10.222 --> 13:12.918
Liz, sweetie, can you run
out to the dessert table

13:13.058 --> 13:13.922
and get me something?

13:14.059 --> 13:16.084
Oh, sure, but you should know
that I work for tips.

13:17.429 --> 13:21.331
You've got the charm and spark
of a young Leona Helmsley.

13:31.210 --> 13:33.770
Is that...
Has he finished?

13:33.913 --> 13:36.040
Not yet,
but don't disturb him.

13:36.182 --> 13:37.774
He can't keep going
like this.

13:37.917 --> 13:40.249
He was up
for six hours straight.

13:48.227 --> 13:52.061
My God, he's a genius.

13:52.198 --> 13:53.222
My God.

14:01.674 --> 14:06.236
Ugh. Look at that loser,
sitting all alone and sad.

14:06.378 --> 14:08.846
He's like me yesterday.
I hate him.

14:08.981 --> 14:10.312
Oh, I don't know, Lemon.

14:10.449 --> 14:12.076
I'm actually starting to feel
sorry for the poor bastard.

14:12.218 --> 14:14.709
Oh, boy, you got your period?

14:14.854 --> 14:17.379
Whoo!
Business drunk.

14:17.523 --> 14:19.184
More business juice,
please.

14:19.325 --> 14:22.761
Oh, right. Geiss!

14:22.895 --> 14:24.726
So, are you enjoying
the party?

14:24.864 --> 14:27.162
How could I not be?

14:27.299 --> 14:31.099
Just can't wait to take this
sexual energy back to Kathy.

14:31.237 --> 14:35.230
Banks, don't do this.
Don't marry Kathy.

14:35.374 --> 14:37.103
It may not be worth it.

14:37.243 --> 14:38.540
Why not?

14:38.677 --> 14:40.702
We're absolutely perfect
for each other.

14:40.846 --> 14:43.212
She loves that I work out a lot
and talk to people.

14:43.349 --> 14:47.581
And I love how she enjoys
crawling into cabinets

14:47.720 --> 14:49.984
and vents
and other enclosed spaces,

14:50.122 --> 14:52.283
like behind the dryer,
for instance.

14:52.424 --> 14:53.982
You don't really love
this woman.

14:54.126 --> 14:56.856
Look how miserable you are
at your own bachelor party.

14:56.996 --> 14:59.157
That's not why I'm miserable,
you idiot.

14:59.298 --> 15:02.290
I'd marry a thousand
Kathy Geisses to be CEO.

15:02.434 --> 15:05.096
I'm miserable because I know
that I'm not getting it.

15:05.237 --> 15:09.697
Yeah, Geiss told me that
it was gonna be you, Jack...

15:09.842 --> 15:12.106
at my own
sham bachelor party.

15:12.244 --> 15:15.145
Mr. Geiss,
I'm sorry I took so long.

15:16.348 --> 15:17.315
Mr. Geiss?

15:19.018 --> 15:20.576
Aw, blurgh!

15:23.088 --> 15:26.319
So, go ahead, Donaghy.
Rub it in my face.

15:26.458 --> 15:29.291
Normally, I'd say, "I bet you'd
like that," but today I won't.

15:29.428 --> 15:31.293
Devin,
I'm the only other person

15:31.430 --> 15:33.762
who understands what you were
willing to do for this job

15:33.899 --> 15:36.231
and how devastated you must be
that you're not going to get it.

15:36.368 --> 15:37.926
It's like when Christian
won "Project Runway,"

15:38.070 --> 15:39.935
even though Rami was clearly
the better draper.

15:41.307 --> 15:42.831
Oh, God.

15:42.975 --> 15:44.101
I've got to call
this wedding off.

15:44.243 --> 15:45.870
Devin...

15:46.011 --> 15:47.979
I just want you to know...

15:48.113 --> 15:49.478
I hate-respect you.

15:50.449 --> 15:51.507
And I you.

15:53.252 --> 15:54.719
I think Geiss is dead.

15:54.853 --> 15:56.252
We've got to call
Dr. Spaceman.

16:07.132 --> 16:08.793
Duet becomes a trio!

16:08.934 --> 16:10.629
The trio becomes a quartet!

16:10.769 --> 16:12.634
And on and on!
Do you have it?

16:12.771 --> 16:14.204
You go too fast!

16:49.008 --> 16:50.999
Why?!

16:54.613 --> 16:56.638
I've given my whole life
to porn,

16:56.782 --> 16:58.374
and he does it in one day!

16:58.517 --> 17:00.451
One day!

17:00.586 --> 17:01.553
Aah!

17:03.389 --> 17:04.913
What's wrong with him,
Leo?

17:05.057 --> 17:05.989
Well,
to the untrained eye,

17:06.125 --> 17:08.025
he'd appear to be what we
in the medical community

17:08.160 --> 17:09.023
call "sleeping. "

17:09.161 --> 17:11.095
But he is, in fact,
in a diabetic coma,

17:11.230 --> 17:14.722
which could have been avoided
by what we call "eating. "

17:16.535 --> 17:19.163
Do whatever you can, Leo.
He has to wake up.

17:19.304 --> 17:20.531
Okay.

17:20.672 --> 17:21.969
This is the gross part.

17:25.544 --> 17:27.944
Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew.

17:28.079 --> 17:30.071
Ugh!
Ugh, ugh, ugh.

17:30.215 --> 17:31.273
Almost done, almost done.

17:31.417 --> 17:32.975
Aah! Oh.

17:33.118 --> 17:34.278
Ugh!

17:35.554 --> 17:36.919
Damn it.

17:37.056 --> 17:38.250
That shot was just a placebo.

17:39.324 --> 17:41.155
I was hoping
this was psychological.

17:41.293 --> 17:43.284
He may not be faking it
for attention.

17:43.429 --> 17:44.953
Jack, have you seen Don?

17:45.097 --> 17:46.962
Oh, boy,
that doesn't look good.

17:47.099 --> 17:49.033
Don't panic, Jorgenson.
It's under control.

17:49.168 --> 17:50.533
He just has to say one sentence.

17:50.669 --> 17:51.601
Couldn't you just, you know,

17:51.737 --> 17:53.568
inject something
right into his heart?

17:53.705 --> 17:54.797
Oh, I'd love to,

17:54.940 --> 17:57.670
but we have no way of knowing
where the heart is.

17:57.810 --> 17:59.277
See, every human is different.

17:59.411 --> 18:01.106
Jack?

18:01.246 --> 18:03.111
It's okay.
Don isn't feeling well.

18:03.248 --> 18:04.806
He's in a diabetic coma.

18:04.950 --> 18:06.281
But possibly faking.

18:06.418 --> 18:07.442
How did this happen?

18:07.586 --> 18:09.110
It was Jorgenson's fault!

18:09.254 --> 18:10.653
Fair enough.

18:10.789 --> 18:12.188
It's all right.
I'm in charge now.

18:12.324 --> 18:13.985
Uh, you see, yesterday,
I met with Don,

18:14.126 --> 18:17.254
and he said I'm going to become
his successor, so I'm the CEO.

18:17.396 --> 18:21.332
Jack, if this is a power grab,
it's in very bad taste.

18:21.467 --> 18:23.401
No, no, he said it.
He told me to keep it a secret.

18:23.535 --> 18:26.060
No, it's true.
I heard it secondhand from Jack.

18:26.205 --> 18:29.265
Banks! Banks knows!
He can back me up.

18:30.375 --> 18:31.774
Jack...

18:34.613 --> 18:36.376
Jack, I don't know
what you're talking about.

18:37.749 --> 18:39.649
Oh, Daddy!

18:39.785 --> 18:41.878
Daddy, no!
Daddy!

18:43.088 --> 18:46.251
Is it 411 or 911?

18:48.327 --> 18:49.419
Uh, New York.

18:49.561 --> 18:53.793
Uh, diabetes repair, I guess.

18:53.932 --> 18:56.264
Jack,
I know you're mad at me.

18:56.401 --> 18:57.698
Lemon, I am not mad at you.

18:57.836 --> 19:00.430
Look, "TGS" is really
where I belong.

19:00.572 --> 19:02.096
I'm not cut out to be
an executive.

19:02.241 --> 19:03.265
Nonsense.

19:03.408 --> 19:05.273
Granted, you almost killed
Don Geiss,

19:05.410 --> 19:07.844
but let's not forget
Button Classic.

19:07.980 --> 19:10.278
Right, Button Classic.
I crushed that.

19:10.415 --> 19:12.383
So, we both had a mixed day.
That's business.

19:12.518 --> 19:13.678
Today, the board is meeting,

19:13.819 --> 19:15.047
and I am still
their best candidate.

19:15.187 --> 19:16.119
And after I state my case,

19:16.255 --> 19:17.483
I'm sure they will
want to fulfill

19:17.623 --> 19:20.148
Don Geiss' pre-coma wish.

19:20.292 --> 19:23.352
Oh, okay, great, because
I don't think I can return this,

19:23.495 --> 19:27.192
'cause I got business sick
all over it when I got home.

19:32.704 --> 19:34.228
Get out of here, Banks.

19:34.373 --> 19:36.364
I have nothing to say to you
before this meeting.

19:36.508 --> 19:40.444
Then I'll do the talking
for the both of us.

19:40.579 --> 19:41.705
What do you mean, Banks?

19:41.847 --> 19:43.109
I'll tell you, Jack.

19:43.248 --> 19:45.239
There is no meeting today.

19:45.384 --> 19:46.282
See, I convinced the board

19:46.418 --> 19:47.510
to have an emergency meeting
last night.

19:47.653 --> 19:49.848
I tried to call you,
but not on a phone,

19:49.988 --> 19:51.148
so you may
not have heard me.

19:51.290 --> 19:52.689
Devin, what did you do?

19:52.824 --> 19:54.257
I did what's best
for the company.

19:54.393 --> 19:56.588
You see, I convinced them
it was best to act quickly

19:56.728 --> 19:58.389
to quell any fears
among investors,

19:58.530 --> 20:00.725
and everyone agreed that,
for the sake of continuity,

20:00.866 --> 20:04.029
the Geiss family's steady hand
should remain on the wheel.

20:08.740 --> 20:11.300
Of course, Kathy's gonna need
some guidance,

20:11.443 --> 20:13.843
but that's what her fiancé
is for.

20:13.979 --> 20:15.276
No, this can't happen.

20:15.414 --> 20:16.608
Oh, it's happening.

20:19.151 --> 20:20.516
Now,
get out of our office.

20:25.524 --> 20:28.516
I didn't hear handwashing.
