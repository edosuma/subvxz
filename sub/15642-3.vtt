WEBVTT

00:01.084 --> 00:03.711
- Previously on Hit the Floor:
- My wife was amazing.

00:03.836 --> 00:05.635
I'm gonna make sure
whoever did this

00:05.797 --> 00:07.424
feels the pain I'm going through.

00:07.591 --> 00:08.968
This is a PR nightmare.

00:09.134 --> 00:13.355
Oscarjust lost control. You are now
the one person to take advantage of it.

00:13.514 --> 00:15.187
Divorce papers. Benny signed them.

00:15.349 --> 00:17.852
Asked me to give them to you.
You gotta pay his debt.

00:18.018 --> 00:19.440
One hundred and fifty thousand.

00:19.561 --> 00:22.064
- Only 200,000 to go.
- You're sleeping with her.

00:22.189 --> 00:23.862
I couldn't come to games

00:23.941 --> 00:26.239
if my husband
is screwing a Playground employee.

00:26.401 --> 00:29.496
- I'm on it.
- I'm not gonna be your backup piece.

00:29.655 --> 00:31.623
Do you know
who I'm the girlfriend of?

00:31.740 --> 00:33.583
Ex-girlfriend.

00:33.951 --> 00:36.830
If you keep playing on it,
you could blow out your knee.

00:36.995 --> 00:39.874
- A risk I'm willing to take.
- Dad told me you were here now.

00:39.998 --> 00:42.672
Coach, Coach.
Welcome to the show, big baller.

00:43.001 --> 00:45.424
- Dancers can't date players.
- I can't lose my job.

00:45.587 --> 00:48.340
So when we're outside of your house,
there's no us.

00:48.507 --> 00:51.260
You're under arrest
for the murder of Olivia Vincent.

00:51.385 --> 00:53.058
I did not kill my wife!

01:24.459 --> 01:27.554
- You came.
- How could you do this?

01:27.713 --> 01:29.386
I can't tell you what this means.

01:29.506 --> 01:32.430
- How could you do this?
- I didn't.

01:34.094 --> 01:35.562
Chase.

01:35.721 --> 01:38.941
The shovel was found in your trunk.

01:39.099 --> 01:40.976
Dirt from where she was buried
was on it

01:41.101 --> 01:42.728
and your fingerprints are all over.

01:42.853 --> 01:45.231
I didn't kill Olivia.

01:48.859 --> 01:50.861
But I did move her body.

02:02.331 --> 02:04.675
This is the time
when girls start getting clingy.

02:05.709 --> 02:07.461
Couple nights with me

02:07.586 --> 02:10.008
suddenly I'm finding toothbrushes
in my drawers.

02:10.172 --> 02:13.142
These reporters won't leave me alone.
Been hassling me all day.

02:14.134 --> 02:16.262
You're not the only one.

02:16.386 --> 02:19.105
<i>Shocked. I don't know what to say.</i>

02:19.222 --> 02:22.226
<i>I'm watching this play out just like you.
Excuse me. Excuse me.</i>

02:22.392 --> 02:23.769
<i>Ahsha! Ahsha!</i>

02:27.105 --> 02:30.075
Who cares
what Ahsha Hayes thinks?

02:30.442 --> 02:33.161
Obviously some people do.

02:33.654 --> 02:37.033
Doesn't seem like a worthy adversary
for someone like you.

02:37.783 --> 02:39.911
She's an annoyance.

02:40.077 --> 02:42.921
But she's gotten smarter.

02:43.580 --> 02:46.550
She's doing something
that'll get her fired

02:46.708 --> 02:49.882
something she's been able
to keep hidden, even from me.

02:50.212 --> 02:52.385
- But I'm working on it.
- You know,

02:53.090 --> 02:55.593
I think this is the longest
conversation we've had.

02:57.427 --> 02:59.145
Good point.

03:04.226 --> 03:07.446
Shabu-shabu from Cookai doesn't
have the same appeal from a box.

03:07.604 --> 03:09.231
You know we can't eat out.

03:09.356 --> 03:10.949
We're shut-ins.

03:11.108 --> 03:13.031
It's just the way it has to be.

03:13.360 --> 03:15.704
We've been doing good
staying off the grid so far.

03:15.821 --> 03:17.243
I haven't been doing anything.

03:17.406 --> 03:20.205
You're the one working out
our secret meeting spots, taxis,

03:20.367 --> 03:22.335
timing our arrivals at the arena.

03:22.452 --> 03:25.547
Don't know if the Ahsha I met
months ago could've pulled this off.

03:25.622 --> 03:27.875
When the only other option
is losing your job

03:28.041 --> 03:29.714
you have to get creative.

03:32.003 --> 03:35.758
Besides, there are some things
you can do here

03:35.924 --> 03:38.143
that you can't do at a restaurant.

03:51.982 --> 03:55.486
- Did you move my furniture around?
- It's feng. Something.

03:55.652 --> 03:58.952
- My mother thinks I have bad energy.
- Can't imagine why.

04:04.244 --> 04:05.837
But you never talk about family.

04:05.954 --> 04:09.299
- They lend money, I collect it.
- How'd that get to be your job?

04:09.458 --> 04:13.258
Because I don't get invested
in people's personal crap.

04:13.420 --> 04:16.673
Boston's in town.
So our next target is a no-brainer.

04:16.839 --> 04:19.559
Pavle Tipsarevic.
Great wall of Serbia.

04:19.718 --> 04:23.814
He doesn't speak English. My head
hurts trying to communicate with you.

04:24.055 --> 04:27.559
How do you say "married to Benny
until the day you die" in Serbian?

04:36.860 --> 04:40.034
Chase Vincent will be receiving
a plea deal that will allow him

04:40.197 --> 04:42.450
to walk out of prison
in 20 to 3O years.

04:42.783 --> 04:44.330
For murder? That's all?

04:44.493 --> 04:47.292
No one wants a long trial,
particularly me.

04:47.704 --> 04:50.924
His signing will go a long way
towards removing the black eye

04:51.082 --> 04:53.005
he's given this organisation.

04:53.168 --> 04:55.717
But it won't wipe it away completely.

04:55.879 --> 04:57.677
Which is why I'm here.

04:58.465 --> 05:01.093
Your agency represents Hollywood.

05:01.468 --> 05:03.721
I want you to bring it
to the Playground tonight.

05:04.054 --> 05:06.022
People get distracted
by shiny objects.

05:06.181 --> 05:08.309
I want my investors distracted

05:08.475 --> 05:12.230
till this Chase nonsense
is dead and buried.

05:13.063 --> 05:14.940
Soto speak.

05:15.857 --> 05:18.610
- Think you can handle that?
- Consider it done.

05:23.740 --> 05:27.620
You moved Olivia's body,
but you didn't kill her.

05:27.744 --> 05:31.590
- I know it sounds crazy.
- Even if it's the truth, it's crazy.

05:31.706 --> 05:33.549
It's the truth.

05:33.875 --> 05:36.970
You have to believe me.
Look, that's why I called you.

05:37.754 --> 05:40.428
You always saw through him.
You know what he's capable of.

05:42.217 --> 05:43.685
You're talking about Oscar.

05:43.844 --> 05:47.189
Yeah. Look, I came home,

05:47.305 --> 05:49.103
I found her body on the floor.

05:49.224 --> 05:51.272
She fell from the upstairs landing.

05:51.434 --> 05:53.812
The banister was wrenched
from the wall.

05:53.979 --> 05:56.858
Her fingernails were dug in it.

05:56.982 --> 05:58.450
I lost it.

06:00.026 --> 06:01.494
I knew he did it.

06:01.653 --> 06:05.374
And I knew he would get away with it,
like he gets away with everything.

06:05.866 --> 06:08.836
Her body was the only weapon I had
to make him pay.

06:10.120 --> 06:11.747
So I used it.

06:12.372 --> 06:13.919
This is unbelievable.

06:14.082 --> 06:17.131
- Why would I wanna kill Olivia?
- Why would Oscar?

06:17.294 --> 06:18.716
She knew something.

06:19.880 --> 06:23.305
Something she was gonna tell
the world at that groundbreaking.

06:23.425 --> 06:24.927
What did Olivia know?

06:25.093 --> 06:26.640
Sloane,

06:26.803 --> 06:29.522
you think you know how bad
Oscar can be

06:29.681 --> 06:31.274
but you have no idea.

06:33.143 --> 06:36.522
The morning after the groundbreaking,
I drove out to Simi Valley

06:36.688 --> 06:38.611
to chuck the shovel

06:38.773 --> 06:41.492
It wound up in my trunk.

06:42.068 --> 06:44.116
He had me followed.

06:44.279 --> 06:47.783
You and Oscar
became thick as thieves.

06:47.949 --> 06:50.202
Now you want me to see you
as some innocent--

06:50.368 --> 06:54.089
I'm not a saint,
but I'm not a murderer.

06:54.456 --> 06:55.753
The truth?

06:57.208 --> 06:58.801
It'll come out.

06:58.919 --> 07:01.547
What did Olivia know?

07:02.005 --> 07:04.428
Oscar was connected
to Mia Sertner's death.

07:04.841 --> 07:06.309
Mia killed herself.

07:11.973 --> 07:13.350
Connected how?

07:14.559 --> 07:15.936
Olivia didn't tell me.

07:18.772 --> 07:21.446
You want me to sign a plea deal.

07:22.150 --> 07:24.869
- I have to go.
- Where are you going?

07:25.320 --> 07:27.698
I need you on my side.

07:29.407 --> 07:31.284
Goodbye, Chase.

07:38.917 --> 07:40.544
Do you believe Chase is innocent?

07:40.710 --> 07:45.341
A man capable of burying his wife
is certainly capable of killing her.

07:45.674 --> 07:47.017
But?

07:47.801 --> 07:49.303
I also believe

07:49.427 --> 07:52.522
he'd spill any secrets he had
to get out of that jail cell.

07:53.056 --> 07:57.152
And Mia is a big one. I mean,
to even bring her up in the first place

07:57.310 --> 08:00.109
saying her death wasn't a suicide,
but a...

08:00.855 --> 08:03.825
I'm an investigator for the league,
not a homicide detective.

08:04.484 --> 08:07.408
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying it's time to back away.

08:07.570 --> 08:09.447
We signed up for corruption,
not murder.

08:09.614 --> 08:12.208
- Michael.
- Sloane, it's too dangerous.

08:12.367 --> 08:15.871
There's a murderer
inside Devil's Arena.

08:16.287 --> 08:18.255
It's time to get out.

08:28.758 --> 08:30.431
Good evening.

08:30.927 --> 08:33.145
Of course,
all of you know Lionel Davenport

08:33.263 --> 08:34.936
looking stunning as always.

08:35.056 --> 08:37.150
Oscar, you're too much.

08:38.183 --> 08:40.027
Lionel. You have a second?

08:40.102 --> 08:42.025
It's important.

08:43.231 --> 08:44.858
Excuse me.

08:46.860 --> 08:48.282
Chase won't sign the plea deal.

08:59.706 --> 09:02.585
- Yes, I punched Jude over Sloane.
- I'm pretty busy here.

09:02.751 --> 09:06.426
And, yes, we got back together to see
if there was anything between us.

09:06.546 --> 09:08.765
But we are not together now.

09:08.923 --> 09:11.676
You and I are. At least I hope we are.

09:12.343 --> 09:14.937
- Pete, I really--
- Jude said something inappropriate

09:15.055 --> 09:16.352
about the mother of my kid.

09:16.473 --> 09:18.191
That's it.

09:18.349 --> 09:21.944
If he had said anything about you,
I'd have broken his legs.

09:22.937 --> 09:24.439
How about a beer?

09:31.279 --> 09:33.623
Table six could use a refresh
while you're at it.

09:33.740 --> 09:35.617
I'm all over it.

09:45.168 --> 09:47.512
I am a sucker for Kiss Cam.

09:48.129 --> 09:51.884
Make sure you get both of them on it.
Love is in the air.

09:52.050 --> 09:53.768
I want everyone to see it.

12:27.205 --> 12:31.176
The boy was right here.
He said he wanted your autograph.

12:31.334 --> 12:34.929
- <i>He had</i> a <i>whole sob story</i> and--
- <i>It's time for the Kiss Cam.</i>

12:35.088 --> 12:38.638
<i>Oh, yeah, look at those sweethearts,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

12:39.259 --> 12:42.980
<i>Looks like we've got our very own
Devil Girl Ahsha Hayes!</i>

12:43.137 --> 12:46.437
<i>Kiss, kiss, kiss.</i>

12:52.772 --> 12:54.149
<i>Well, all right.</i>

12:57.860 --> 12:59.988
Yeah!

13:08.621 --> 13:10.043
Five minutes.

13:10.206 --> 13:12.208
As my mother or my boss?

13:12.792 --> 13:14.339
Whatever gets you to listen.

13:24.804 --> 13:27.853
One of my oldest friends
is in the ground.

13:28.016 --> 13:29.643
The other is behind bars.

13:30.560 --> 13:34.861
The one thing they had in common
is Devil's Arena.

13:35.732 --> 13:39.657
I've told you,
no one walks away from it clean.

13:39.986 --> 13:41.329
What are you saying?

13:41.487 --> 13:43.330
It's time to go, honey.

13:44.157 --> 13:46.751
There's other teams,
other opportunities.

13:46.909 --> 13:50.379
You can use what you started here
to take you wherever you wanna go.

13:50.830 --> 13:52.628
You want me to quit the Devil Girls?

13:53.082 --> 13:55.710
I'll leave too. We can go together.

13:57.170 --> 14:01.471
I'm sorry about Olivia and Chase.
I am.

14:02.342 --> 14:05.687
But I'm not them. And I'm not you.

14:06.429 --> 14:08.648
I have started something here.

14:08.806 --> 14:10.683
Something great.

14:12.018 --> 14:15.443
I don't wanna look back 20 years from
now and wonder if I made a mistake.

14:17.315 --> 14:21.070
I understand if you need to go,
but I'm staying.

14:25.990 --> 14:27.367
You are me.

14:29.535 --> 14:31.583
Stubborn as hell.

14:52.809 --> 14:54.106
<i>Hey-</i>

14:54.268 --> 14:55.770
Zero.

14:59.816 --> 15:01.489
Listen

15:02.068 --> 15:04.821
I don't know how to say this,
so I'm just gonna.

15:04.987 --> 15:07.536
I had no idea you and Jelena
used to be a thing.

15:07.990 --> 15:10.288
Ancient history. It's all good.

15:10.868 --> 15:12.836
Someone told me
you only just broke up.

15:12.995 --> 15:16.875
It was swift and decisive.
Don't worry about it.

15:17.333 --> 15:19.631
I mean it, Terrence.
Say the word and I'll end it.

15:19.752 --> 15:22.096
No looking back. Hand to God.

15:22.255 --> 15:25.759
- I'm here to ball, not cause drama.
- I wouldn't be selling the restaurant

15:25.925 --> 15:28.974
I named after her
if I was still hung up on her.

15:31.139 --> 15:35.110
Listen, the only relationships
I care about are the ones on the court.

15:35.518 --> 15:36.895
I need that ring.

15:39.105 --> 15:42.484
In the Ohio locker room all we talked
about was how bad we felt for you.

15:43.734 --> 15:46.533
Derek was obviously not pulling
his weight in the playoffs.

15:46.696 --> 15:49.199
Some of the guys even joked
about it.

15:50.283 --> 15:52.661
You don't have to worry about that
with me here.

15:52.785 --> 15:54.162
I got your back.

16:00.084 --> 16:01.427
Pavle!

16:03.212 --> 16:04.509
How are you?

16:05.089 --> 16:07.683
Thanks for driving on over
for little old me.

16:10.928 --> 16:13.852
Still haven't cracked
that Rosetta Stone I got you, huh?

16:15.516 --> 16:18.770
Pavle, you shouldn't have.

16:18.936 --> 16:20.233
He didn't.

16:21.731 --> 16:23.699
- Lexi?
- You never should've let this one

16:23.858 --> 16:25.531
out of your sight.

16:25.902 --> 16:29.076
Someone else was bound
to snatch him up.

16:30.698 --> 16:32.041
Girlfriend.

16:32.200 --> 16:35.625
Actually, Pavle, it's fiancé.

16:38.998 --> 16:41.000
Fourteen carats?

16:42.668 --> 16:44.045
Fourteen point two.

16:44.545 --> 16:46.639
Gag on that irony.

16:52.178 --> 16:55.182
I haven't heard from you all day.
Must be really busy.

16:55.306 --> 16:56.683
Must be.

16:56.849 --> 16:59.193
Okay, I'll take the initiative.

16:59.352 --> 17:02.856
Dinner? You and me?
We can make reservations at Jelena's

17:02.980 --> 17:04.323
while it's still around.

17:05.191 --> 17:07.865
- Meaning?
- You haven't heard.

17:07.984 --> 17:10.113
Terrence is selling it.

17:18.412 --> 17:23.794
You don't wanna be tied down, Pavle.
You're too big and rich.

17:23.960 --> 17:27.931
And that Lexi is as twisted
as Enrique lglesias'--

17:28.089 --> 17:29.557
Let's just say I've seen things.

17:29.715 --> 17:31.183
Save it.

17:31.551 --> 17:34.395
The only English he knows
is what I teach him.

17:34.554 --> 17:37.933
Go find yourself another sucker.
This one's mine.

17:38.057 --> 17:40.936
I give this three weeks, tops.

17:41.060 --> 17:43.529
Actually, it'll be at least 18 years.

17:43.688 --> 17:45.031
Me baby.

17:45.147 --> 17:48.071
I'll translate for you. I'm pregnant.

17:51.862 --> 17:54.411
These shots are for the website,
so look sharp.

17:54.574 --> 17:58.078
There we go, there we go.
Arms are still. Look at that bad boy.

17:58.244 --> 18:01.248
I can see Derek and Terrence
are on shaky ground.

18:01.414 --> 18:04.509
Now, do you see
why I sold you so hard on L.A.?

18:04.667 --> 18:06.635
- It's a land of opportunity.
- Come on.

18:06.794 --> 18:10.014
Zero, get in there, buddy.
Let's get a ball each. There we go.

18:10.172 --> 18:12.846
Zero, Zero, Zero.
You know the score.

18:13.009 --> 18:15.103
And it's way more than zero.

18:15.595 --> 18:17.893
Come on, Derek.
In you come, let's go, come on.

18:18.055 --> 18:19.807
<i>- HEY-
- HEY-</i>

18:19.974 --> 18:23.023
- Cool shoot.
- Yeah.

18:23.144 --> 18:24.737
It's very cool.

18:25.688 --> 18:27.907
- It was just Kiss Cam--
- Didn't mean anything.

18:28.024 --> 18:30.402
- It was just a Kiss Cam.
- People were screaming.

18:30.568 --> 18:32.696
- It was, you know, crazy.
- Yeah.

18:32.820 --> 18:34.367
Yeah.

18:35.072 --> 18:36.870
All right, I'll see you later.

18:38.117 --> 18:41.496
All right.
Hang on, mate, let me reload.

18:41.621 --> 18:43.464
Causing trouble with the Kiss Cam?

18:43.581 --> 18:45.299
Little juvenile, no?

18:45.458 --> 18:48.462
I'm just saying, I would've expected
something less simple

18:48.586 --> 18:50.554
from Jelena Howard.

18:51.422 --> 18:54.722
Then it must not be as simple
as it appears?

18:54.884 --> 18:56.227
All right.

18:56.344 --> 18:57.846
The Roman emperor.

18:58.012 --> 18:59.605
Oh, mean and moody.

18:59.764 --> 19:01.983
Mean and moody, Derek.
That's it, Derek.

19:05.311 --> 19:07.734
- Derek saw the kiss.
- Are you serious?

19:08.439 --> 19:10.862
I thought he was in the locker room.

19:11.359 --> 19:14.158
Terrence. Come in, mate.
Terrence, in here for me,

19:14.320 --> 19:16.994
and Jelena, in you come.
Let's get the couple together.

19:17.156 --> 19:19.875
This is what the fans want, right?
Okay, let me see it.

19:20.242 --> 19:24.418
- And a little happier would be.
- How much did you get for it?

19:24.580 --> 19:26.082
For what?

19:26.248 --> 19:29.092
- The restaurant.
- Okay, switch sides for me.

19:29.251 --> 19:31.754
It's purely a business decision.

19:32.380 --> 19:34.883
Really? Just business.

19:35.049 --> 19:37.051
Just business.

19:37.343 --> 19:39.562
It's an asset I don't need any more.

19:39.720 --> 19:41.472
Taking five.

19:46.519 --> 19:48.271
Ahsha isn't going anywhere.

19:48.437 --> 19:50.235
And if she isn't,

19:50.398 --> 19:52.150
neither am I.

19:52.316 --> 19:54.444
Sloane, I really think
that's a bad idea.

19:54.860 --> 19:56.362
Well, I'm sorry, Michael.

19:56.529 --> 20:00.830
If you wanted a quitter,
you got the wrong girl.

20:04.245 --> 20:06.339
Well, then,
looks like we need to find out

20:06.497 --> 20:08.545
what Olivia had on Oscar.

20:14.255 --> 20:16.007
Five minutes.

20:24.807 --> 20:27.777
- Hello?
- Chase.

20:27.935 --> 20:31.781
<i>I was surprised to hear
about your lack of cooperation.</i>

20:32.231 --> 20:34.984
- There's a plea deal on the table.
- Why <i>would I</i> confess

20:35.151 --> 20:36.778
to something I didn't do?

20:36.902 --> 20:40.327
<i>Your guilt, or lack thereof,
is inconsequential.</i>

20:40.781 --> 20:43.204
You'll sign because if you do,

20:43.367 --> 20:46.712
you'll be able to walk
out of there in 2O to 30 years.

20:46.871 --> 20:48.794
<i>And if you don't,</i>

20:49.081 --> 20:53.757
<i>well, the fact that we're even having
this conversation should tell you</i>

20:53.919 --> 20:56.889
<i>there's nowhere I can't get to you.</i>

20:57.423 --> 21:00.051
Choice is yours, Chase.

21:11.604 --> 21:14.574
Oscar's private jet,
with his compliments.

21:14.732 --> 21:16.075
He's still high off the win.

21:16.233 --> 21:20.204
Having Zero on the team
doesn't matter

21:20.362 --> 21:22.535
because this trip
is not about basketball.

21:22.698 --> 21:25.702
This trip is about me
taking you to San Francisco

21:25.826 --> 21:27.578
for the date of your life.

21:27.703 --> 21:31.708
No work, no Devil talk. Just us.

21:33.125 --> 21:34.502
This seat taken?

21:34.668 --> 21:36.636
Just us?

21:36.754 --> 21:40.725
Oscar gave us the plane
for the night alone.

21:41.175 --> 21:43.724
Well, I don't know anything
about that.

21:43.886 --> 21:45.980
I'm just escorting Lionel
to a winery in Napa.

21:46.138 --> 21:48.687
A little thank you from Oscar
for coming to the party.

21:48.849 --> 21:52.353
I was under the impression
that this was a solo flight as well.

21:56.774 --> 21:58.902
- At least it'll be a short flight.
- Exactly.

21:59.026 --> 22:01.199
What could possibly happen
in 45 minutes?

22:05.241 --> 22:06.743
She is not pregnant.

22:06.909 --> 22:09.082
- This is a scam.
- So she ran a better game.

22:09.245 --> 22:11.839
You missed your window,
we move on to the next one.

22:11.997 --> 22:14.716
We don't play the same.
If you can't see the difference

22:14.875 --> 22:18.470
between what she is doing and what
I'm doing, you are touched in the head.

22:18.629 --> 22:21.257
I am not moving on.
Pavle needs my help.

22:21.382 --> 22:24.306
Well, I need that 200 G's leftover
that your hubby owes.

22:24.468 --> 22:26.812
- You'll get it.
- When did you go soft?

22:27.972 --> 22:31.226
I feel for the guy, okay?
I know what's it like to get conned

22:31.392 --> 22:33.565
- into a marriage.
- How did Benny con you?

22:36.105 --> 22:38.199
He promised me the world.

22:41.068 --> 22:43.036
Lexi invited me
to the engagement party.

22:43.195 --> 22:45.664
She wants a gift,
being able to rub it in my face.

22:45.781 --> 22:49.285
- And you're going?
- With a gift for Pavle.

22:49.451 --> 22:51.328
I'm breaking them up.

22:52.955 --> 22:55.253
I just don't know how yet.

23:02.631 --> 23:05.555
- Hey you.
- Hey.

23:05.718 --> 23:09.564
There's a new Thai place. I think their
stuff comes in fancy plastic containers.

23:09.722 --> 23:11.850
Yeah, I-- I gotta hit the showers.

23:12.016 --> 23:13.689
We'll figure it out later.

23:13.851 --> 23:15.353
Okay.

23:23.444 --> 23:25.446
Pete, listen.

23:26.071 --> 23:28.824
I'm really sorry about, you know,
what I said to you.

23:28.991 --> 23:31.244
- It's fine, apology accepted.
- It wasn't cool.

23:31.410 --> 23:33.162
You and Sloane
have history together.

23:33.329 --> 23:35.627
Then I come along,
flapping my big mouth.

23:35.789 --> 23:39.669
- I never know when to shut up.
- Hey, why don't you and I get a drink?

23:49.929 --> 23:52.182
You seem like a nice person.

23:54.475 --> 23:57.729
I could watch you crash and burn,
but that wouldn't make me feel good.

23:58.354 --> 24:01.028
Lionel, I don't know you,
you don't know me

24:01.190 --> 24:03.943
- and you don't know--
- I'll say it so you don't have to.

24:04.109 --> 24:06.407
It's none of my business, I know.

24:07.404 --> 24:09.873
But if someone would have told me
before I married--

24:10.032 --> 24:12.455
- Told you what?
- That he leaves.

24:13.077 --> 24:14.920
From what I understand,
you left him.

24:15.871 --> 24:17.293
Not in the way it counts.

24:17.748 --> 24:21.503
He leaves in inches.
Checks out, turns off, shuts down.

24:21.669 --> 24:23.592
Before you know it, he's gone.

24:23.754 --> 24:25.631
The drinking comes along with it.

24:25.798 --> 24:27.425
It's how he avoids things.

24:27.591 --> 24:30.140
I'm sure you've noticed
he's never far from a glass.

24:30.552 --> 24:34.398
Just because that was your experience
doesn't mean it's gonna be mine.

24:34.556 --> 24:37.025
That's the risk we take, isn't it?

24:39.603 --> 24:41.071
You have a child, don't you?

24:49.071 --> 24:51.415
How you doing? You okay?

24:53.033 --> 24:54.751
- No.
- You don't look too good.

24:54.868 --> 24:57.121
Well, are you airsick? Or--?

24:57.913 --> 25:00.041
- I wanna go back.
- Back? "Back" back?

25:00.207 --> 25:02.084
Like, turn the plane around?

25:02.251 --> 25:04.253
- Are you okay with that?
- Sure.

25:04.753 --> 25:08.803
We're halfway there. It'll take us
just as long to get there as--

25:08.966 --> 25:11.310
Pete, I'm not thinking
about San Francisco now.

25:11.427 --> 25:13.805
Can we please just go?

25:13.971 --> 25:15.268
Yeah, okay. Sure.

25:15.431 --> 25:17.775
" Okay?
" Okay

25:26.025 --> 25:28.619
Lexi, open mine next.

25:29.778 --> 25:32.122
What do you think of the party, Kyle?

25:32.281 --> 25:35.581
This is one shotgun engagement
I wish I brought a shotgun to.

25:37.327 --> 25:39.796
Been here for two hours.

25:39.955 --> 25:42.049
It's time to raise the white flag.

25:43.208 --> 25:46.007
If a woman is hiding a secret,
it's in her purse.

25:46.170 --> 25:48.969
Well, how do you know
which one is hers?

25:49.131 --> 25:53.432
Tacky knockoff full of crap.
Just like the woman who carries it.

26:06.774 --> 26:08.151
Is that my purse?

26:08.275 --> 26:10.824
It fell. And look what rolled out.

26:11.361 --> 26:12.908
Lacatane.

26:13.072 --> 26:15.791
This is for acne.
I thought you were a natural beauty.

26:15.949 --> 26:19.044
I am. I take it to stop sweating.
I dance hard--

26:19.203 --> 26:21.376
- These are tanning pills.
- For the vitamins.

26:21.538 --> 26:23.961
- Can you get your grubby hands--?
- Fenotrex?

26:24.124 --> 26:27.298
That's a weight loss pill. I didn't think
they made that anymore.

26:27.461 --> 26:31.011
For energy. I have so many projects
in the works.

26:31.173 --> 26:33.471
- I'm killing it.
- You're killing your baby.

26:33.592 --> 26:34.969
What are you talking about?

26:35.135 --> 26:36.887
Pregnant women
can't take any of these.

26:37.054 --> 26:38.647
They cause horrible birth defects.

26:40.390 --> 26:44.020
Either you're a horrible mother
or you're not really pregnant.

26:45.270 --> 26:48.991
Which is it, Lexi?
Are you trying to hurt your baby?

26:49.149 --> 26:51.698
All right! I'm not pregnant.

26:51.860 --> 26:53.157
Nope.

26:53.612 --> 26:57.742
I'm not pregnant, but that doesn't mean
we're not getting married.

27:15.509 --> 27:17.637
I know you don't understand

27:17.803 --> 27:19.271
but you dodged a bullet.

27:19.429 --> 27:22.148
A fake, crazy-ass bullet.

27:30.315 --> 27:32.067
Now, that's a party favour.

27:37.239 --> 27:39.458
You betcha.

27:44.121 --> 27:45.748
This guy's on the rebound.

27:45.914 --> 27:49.509
Show him a good time.
He deserves it.

27:52.337 --> 27:53.805
Here.

27:54.298 --> 27:56.551
That should put a dent in the tab.

28:00.554 --> 28:05.560
Sorry Jude and Lionel ruined our date.
Next time I will charter my own jet.

28:05.726 --> 28:07.979
This has nothing to do
with Jude and Lionel.

28:08.103 --> 28:10.822
You're upset. I assumed--
Raquel, hey, talk to me.

28:10.981 --> 28:13.325
I told Miguel about you.

28:13.483 --> 28:14.826
Mama.

28:18.572 --> 28:20.370
I'll be right in.

28:26.371 --> 28:29.375
I've never told Miguel about any guy.

28:30.042 --> 28:33.512
And there's a reason.
His father is garbage.

28:33.670 --> 28:38.096
And I couldn't risk my son
getting attached to anyone else.

28:38.258 --> 28:43.389
Not until I knew that person was here
100 percent.

28:44.056 --> 28:45.558
I don't know that that's you

28:45.724 --> 28:48.944
and I don't know if that can be you.
I'm sorry.

29:25.973 --> 29:27.270
Well?

29:28.267 --> 29:30.941
We are outside in public together.

29:31.436 --> 29:35.111
Sort of. You're missing the gesture.

29:35.857 --> 29:37.609
This is our spot.

29:38.443 --> 29:40.116
Wanna do it?

29:48.996 --> 29:51.499
It was just a Kiss Cam.
I should have walked away.

29:51.623 --> 29:53.751
It's not about the Kiss Cam.

29:53.917 --> 29:56.796
Then what is it about?

29:58.005 --> 30:00.884
- Seeing you kiss another guy--
- I know.

30:01.049 --> 30:06.306
Seeing you kiss another guy.

30:07.389 --> 30:09.687
It made me realise

30:12.102 --> 30:14.150
I love you.

30:15.689 --> 30:19.660
L-- I am in love with you,
Ahsha Hayes.

30:29.328 --> 30:31.296
I love you too.

30:52.351 --> 30:55.901
Lionel. Lionel!
Hey, I thought it was interesting

30:56.021 --> 30:58.319
before Raquel asked
to turn the plane around

30:58.482 --> 31:00.576
that you two were
in deep conversation.

31:00.734 --> 31:03.283
- I have to get my seat before--
- I'll hold the game.

31:03.403 --> 31:07.078
You're not here to watch. You're not
even here to get your face on camera.

31:07.240 --> 31:09.663
You came to Devils' Arena
for a reason.

31:09.785 --> 31:12.288
- Pete, you're in my way.
- You want the Malibu house?

31:12.454 --> 31:15.298
The cabin in Big Bear?
What is it that you want from me?

31:15.457 --> 31:16.834
YOu!

31:17.876 --> 31:19.344
Okay?

31:20.420 --> 31:22.343
I want you.

31:23.131 --> 31:27.136
It's why I'm here.
It's why I'm dragging out the divorce.

31:29.346 --> 31:31.940
That doesn't make any sense.

31:32.099 --> 31:33.396
You left me.

31:34.142 --> 31:35.519
To wake you up.

31:36.395 --> 31:38.864
Make you see what you were losing.

31:39.189 --> 31:40.987
But you moved on.

31:41.650 --> 31:42.947
I haven't.

31:48.281 --> 31:50.033
We have history.

31:51.368 --> 31:52.915
But that's it.

31:53.078 --> 31:54.876
I'm sorry.

31:59.835 --> 32:01.553
Give it up!

32:09.344 --> 32:14.066
<i>And that's it. A tough night
for the Devils as they lose to Boston.</i>

32:15.976 --> 32:17.728
You guys stink!

32:17.894 --> 32:20.568
What are you doing out there?
You should've had that!

32:20.730 --> 32:24.360
Yo, yo, yo.
What happened out there?

32:24.526 --> 32:26.528
- Just an off night.
- More than just off.

32:26.695 --> 32:28.242
- Everything cool?
- I'm fine.

32:28.405 --> 32:30.248
You got the right bench, yo!

32:34.953 --> 32:36.671
Nice.

32:44.754 --> 32:48.179
- Thanks for waiting around.
- Thanks for the courtside seats.

32:48.341 --> 32:49.843
Miguel's never sat close before.

32:56.141 --> 32:58.314
Actually, Miguel's the one
I wanted to see.

32:58.477 --> 33:00.821
I was hoping to play
a little one-on-one with him.

33:00.979 --> 33:03.653
- You.
- Look, I know you're scared.

33:04.357 --> 33:06.826
And I understand why.

33:06.943 --> 33:09.321
But, Raquel, I am not Jesse.

33:09.488 --> 33:12.082
I am here 100 percent.

33:19.372 --> 33:20.669
Miguel.

33:26.213 --> 33:28.307
Miguel, this is Pete.

33:28.423 --> 33:30.471
Pete, this is Miguel.

33:31.176 --> 33:33.349
- Hi.
- Hi.

33:33.512 --> 33:35.059
- How you doing?
- Good.

33:35.180 --> 33:37.899
Hey, you want me to show you
how to shoot that thing?

33:38.391 --> 33:41.065
- It's okay.
- Yeah?

33:41.144 --> 33:44.273
Come on, I know we lost,
but I'm still a good coach, I promise.

33:44.439 --> 33:48.535
I promise. First of all
you don't have to do this, right?

33:48.693 --> 33:50.912
Don't do this not-looking stuff
because that's--

33:51.071 --> 33:52.618
Oh, see what happens?

33:57.536 --> 33:59.789
- What's this?
- Keep it.

33:59.955 --> 34:02.549
Pawnshops are a hassle.
Might as well be a paperweight.

34:05.627 --> 34:08.722
You know this means it's gonna
take longer to pay off Benny's debt.

34:09.339 --> 34:12.434
Well, we better pick
our next target then.

34:36.699 --> 34:39.078
- Look who's clingy.
- Stay.

34:40.954 --> 34:44.424
What could be more satisfying
than laying naked with me?

34:51.797 --> 34:56.099
Once upon a time,
there was a stupid girl.

34:57.262 --> 34:58.684
She had a new boyfriend

34:58.805 --> 35:02.275
who was forced to watch her kiss
her old boyfriend on a Jumbotron

35:02.434 --> 35:05.313
in front of 20,000 people.

35:05.478 --> 35:09.608
Suddenly, the stupid girl
who was so clever

35:09.774 --> 35:14.450
in keeping her new boyfriend secret
got sloppy.

35:16.114 --> 35:19.038
So your not-so-simple plan worked.

35:22.162 --> 35:23.630
It's just a story.

35:24.831 --> 35:27.880
Hey. I got a story too.

35:29.002 --> 35:31.380
Once upon a time

35:31.504 --> 35:34.348
a sexy guy
made an offer on a restaurant

35:34.507 --> 35:37.977
named after a wicked queen.

35:45.101 --> 35:49.698
I don't want or need you
to buy me things.

35:50.106 --> 35:51.699
Back off.

35:52.942 --> 35:56.697
You are so cold,
it's almost sociopathic.

35:58.114 --> 36:00.333
There's more to the story.

36:00.492 --> 36:03.837
Unfortunately, this sexy guy
couldn't buy it.

36:03.995 --> 36:06.874
The owner took it off the market.

36:16.299 --> 36:19.894
<i>Tonight, at Devils' Arena,
the Devils were crushed by Boston.</i>

36:20.053 --> 36:21.805
<i>Terrence Wall did not bring
his A-game.</i>

36:21.971 --> 36:24.815
<i>Hey, it's one thing for a captain
to go down with his ship,</i>

36:24.974 --> 36:27.102
<i>but it's another thing
for him to crash it.</i>

36:27.268 --> 36:29.441
<i>That about sums up
the Devils' loss to Boston.</i>

36:29.604 --> 36:31.982
<i>After the break,
we'll have the weather.</i>

37:01.886 --> 37:04.685
<i>- Hello.
- Derek Roman? TMZ.</i>

37:04.848 --> 37:07.101
<i>Got a nice shot of you
and your lady up the hill.</i>

37:07.267 --> 37:09.611
<i>Care to comment before we post?</i>

37:21.781 --> 37:23.909
You can save your breath.

37:24.951 --> 37:26.669
I signed the plea deal.

37:26.786 --> 37:31.132
I always knew you were smarter
than people gave you credit for, Chase.

37:32.083 --> 37:35.337
You made a big mistake
putting her at my build site.

37:39.424 --> 37:41.097
Take care.

37:43.052 --> 37:44.349
You killed my wife!

37:49.476 --> 37:50.944
I didn't actually.

37:51.060 --> 37:52.937
You're lying.

37:55.106 --> 37:58.030
You're certainly welcome to believe
whatever you want.

37:58.193 --> 37:59.536
As am I.

38:00.445 --> 38:04.245
Butsay
we were both telling the truth

38:05.492 --> 38:07.665
I didn't kill Olivia,

38:08.077 --> 38:10.956
and you didn't kill Olivia.

38:13.041 --> 38:14.384
Who did?

38:42.445 --> 38:46.166
- Next on Hit the Floor:
- A photographer got pictures of us

38:46.324 --> 38:48.452
at the overlook.
He sold them to TMZ.

38:48.618 --> 38:50.541
I'm going to be kicked out
of Devil Girls.

38:50.662 --> 38:52.960
Ahsha needs to fix this.
I can help if you want.

38:53.122 --> 38:56.422
We're 96 grand from the finish line.
I need to finish this.

38:56.543 --> 38:59.342
I've been invited
to the reading of Olivia's will tonight.

38:59.462 --> 39:01.180
What would she leave you?

39:01.339 --> 39:04.138
In these plays, you get the ball more,
Derek gets it less.

39:04.300 --> 39:07.019
I don't wanna be seen as the new guy
stirring things up.

39:09.055 --> 39:10.807
- Is that my phone?
- He got to you.
