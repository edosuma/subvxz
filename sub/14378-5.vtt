Look at us.

00:45.116 --> 00:48.266
We sure stuffed
our faces
at that luau.

00:48.300 --> 00:51.250
Dee Dee: Hey,
my hula dancing lessons!

00:51.283 --> 00:53.300
You caught on
so fast, dear.

Dad: Hey, remember
that scenic helicopter ride.

00:57.083 --> 00:59.100
Dexter:
That was cool.

00:59.133 --> 01:01.050
Oh, your poor dad.

01:01.083 --> 01:03.133
Hey, what's
that picture
doing in here?

01:03.166 --> 01:06.316
[Nervously]
Uh, hey, look,
we're in love.

01:06.350 --> 01:07.483
Ah, what fond memories.

01:08.016 --> 01:10.383
If only I could remember
where we went.

01:10.416 --> 01:14.166
Dad, we went
to Hawaii, remember?

01:14.200 --> 01:16.066
And look, Dexter,

01:16.100 --> 01:18.250
here's where you
fell into that hole.

01:18.283 --> 01:21.383
Boy, it took hours
to get you out of there.

01:21.416 --> 01:24.350
That is because
stupid Dee Dee
pushed me in.

01:24.383 --> 01:26.000
Uh-uh. You fell in.

01:26.033 --> 01:28.166
You were still wearing
your leg brace.

01:28.200 --> 01:29.450
Remember, clumsy child?

01:29.483 --> 01:30.433
Was not.

01:30.466 --> 01:32.116
Was to.
Was not.

01:32.150 --> 01:33.066
Was to.
Was not.

01:33.100 --> 01:34.233
Was to.
Was not.

01:34.266 --> 01:36.433
Kids, it's been
so long, who could
possibly remember?

01:36.466 --> 01:40.033
Isn't it funny how much
we forget as we get older?

01:40.066 --> 01:42.066
Remember last year
when I lost my keys

01:42.100 --> 01:45.216
and had to climb through
the doggy door for 3 weeks?

01:45.250 --> 01:47.333
And I locked
the keys in the car

01:47.366 --> 01:49.433
for the third time
this month.

01:49.466 --> 01:50.416
Yeah? Well, yesterday,

01:50.450 --> 01:53.100
I left for work
without my pants.

01:53.133 --> 01:54.083
Mom: And today,

01:54.116 --> 01:57.016
I wrote "1986"
on all of my checks.

01:57.050 --> 02:01.150
Well, a lot of stuff
happened in 1986.

02:02.483 --> 02:04.333
What were we talking about?

02:04.366 --> 02:06.350
All right, kids,
upstairs.

02:06.383 --> 02:09.133
Time to finish
homework.

02:09.466 --> 02:13.083
Mom: Would you like
some coffee, dear?

02:13.116 --> 02:14.050
Sure, honey.

02:14.083 --> 02:16.033
Chocolate chip
or vanilla?

02:16.066 --> 02:17.333
[Sighs]

02:18.083 --> 02:19.366
What a thorough
disappointment.

02:19.400 --> 02:23.333
I had no idea
my parents were so stupid.

02:23.366 --> 02:24.366
They're not
stupid.

02:24.400 --> 02:28.066
They just can't
remember that far back.

02:28.100 --> 02:29.233
That is no excuse.

02:29.266 --> 02:31.300
Why, I have
no trouble at all

02:31.333 --> 02:33.066
remembering way back to...

02:33.100 --> 02:36.083
Back to...Back to...

02:36.116 --> 02:38.383
No!

02:38.416 --> 02:40.100
My infancy is cloudy.

02:40.133 --> 02:43.366
I cannot remember
my first baby steps,
my first solid food.

02:43.400 --> 02:45.483
Your first
dirty diaper?

02:46.016 --> 02:47.233
It is all a blur.

02:47.266 --> 02:49.016
Is it possible?

02:49.050 --> 02:52.350
Could new information
going into my brain
be pushing out the old?

02:52.383 --> 02:53.383
Hey, Dexter.

02:53.416 --> 02:55.066
What? I am busy.

02:55.100 --> 02:58.383
Bet you haven't seen
my dance of
the fanciful unicorn.

02:58.416 --> 03:00.066

03:05.433 --> 03:08.416
I already have
a thousand memories
of that stupid dance.

03:08.450 --> 03:10.200
Ooh, what does
this button do?

03:10.233 --> 03:13.266
Stop, stop, stop!
You are erasing
vital information.

03:13.300 --> 03:15.000
You must leave
at once.

03:15.033 --> 03:17.066
You are wreaking
havoc on my brain.

03:17.100 --> 03:18.483
Hey, want to hear
a funny joke?

03:19.016 --> 03:21.200
Because
it was stapled
to the chicken.

03:21.233 --> 03:23.083
Hey, how did you know?

03:23.116 --> 03:25.150

about a lost memory again.

04:12.366 --> 04:14.350
I have come to take
your memories away.

04:14.383 --> 04:17.116
You'll have to fight me
for them.

05:22.383 --> 05:24.033
Now to find
my glasses...

05:24.066 --> 05:27.100
...and get back to business.

05:36.200 --> 05:38.150
Hey, I
defeated you.
I defeated you.

05:38.183 --> 05:40.133
I knocked
you out.

Hey, look,
falling stars.

05:49.450 --> 05:51.416
Where?
Here.

05:52.316 --> 05:54.283
I'd say that's
pretty fair and square.

05:54.316 --> 05:56.316
And now to retrieve
what I came here for.

05:56.350 --> 05:58.433
Once I download Dexter's
scientific memories,

05:58.466 --> 06:00.083
I'll know everything
Dexter knows.

06:00.116 --> 06:02.316
I'll be smarter than Dexter,
more creative than Dexter.

06:02.350 --> 06:05.366
And I'll be able
to destroy Dexter's lab
once and for all.

06:05.400 --> 06:07.150

all by himself.

06:24.383 --> 06:26.350

I've been waiting for.

quite a creation.

taking you? I want
to see the creation.

Hooray for Dexter!

all by himself.

prepubescent garbage?
Where's the science?

06:52.150 --> 06:55.416
Look at our son--
the scientist.

06:55.450 --> 06:57.116
Yeah, that's
more like it.

06:57.150 --> 07:01.250
Dear, do you think
he's too young to go
trick-or-treating?

07:01.283 --> 07:02.383
Nonsense.

07:02.416 --> 07:05.316
Son, do you like
trick-or-treating
with Dee Dee?

07:05.350 --> 07:07.283
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
I like candy.

your scientist costume?

07:10.300 --> 07:11.400
What is a scientist?

07:11.433 --> 07:13.400
What is this?
What's going on here?

07:13.433 --> 07:16.266

to meet somebody.

It's your

So that I can invent

Look at his
pathetic expression.

19:43.433 --> 19:47.033
TV has robbed him
of his personality,

19:47.066 --> 19:48.233
as well as his mind.

19:48.266 --> 19:52.133
He exists
exclusively
in a TV wasteland.

his days,

19:54.183 --> 19:56.383

learning something.

he's learned
