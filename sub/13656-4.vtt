WEBVTT

00:04.459 --> 00:06.543
Rusty, time to get up.

00:07.980 --> 00:09.093
Let's go.

00:15.412 --> 00:18.206
Rusty, I said get up
five minutes ago.

00:18.241 --> 00:20.171
Come on, let's move!

00:20.206 --> 00:21.872
I'm up.

00:21.907 --> 00:23.508
I'm up.

00:29.493 --> 00:31.064
What the hell?!

00:31.098 --> 00:34.437
Throw on some clothes.
We're leaving.

00:34.473 --> 00:38.513
It's not even 6:00 yet!
I have another half-hour!

00:38.581 --> 00:40.117
What is the rush?

00:40.151 --> 00:41.153
We needed to be out of here
five minutes ago.

00:41.187 --> 00:42.489
Let's go. Go, go.

00:42.523 --> 00:44.094
Okay, all right,
well, I am not starting

00:44.128 --> 00:45.497
the first day
of a brand-new school

00:45.532 --> 00:47.201
without a shower, so...
No, no, no.

00:47.269 --> 00:49.572
Rusty! No, don't.
Don't... don't... oh!

00:50.976 --> 00:52.445
Rusty!

00:52.479 --> 00:54.582
Open the door immediately!
I need to be at a crime scene!

00:54.616 --> 00:56.219
My clothes are off!

00:56.254 --> 00:58.157
My clothes are off!

00:58.192 --> 01:03.635
<i>In 100 feet,</i>
<i>turn right onto Mercer Avenue.</i>

01:03.669 --> 01:06.040
I shouldn't
be going to this school.

01:06.075 --> 01:07.643
I'm not even catholic.

01:07.678 --> 01:10.683
Just walk around with a guilty
expression on your face.

01:10.717 --> 01:12.220
You'll fit right in.

01:12.254 --> 01:15.092
What am I supposed to
tell people about myself?

01:15.127 --> 01:16.562
Do a lot of listening.

01:16.597 --> 01:18.233
Stay away from the stuff
that happened last summer.

01:18.267 --> 01:19.669
If anybody
gives you a hard time,

01:19.703 --> 01:21.506
do not try
and handle it yourself.

01:21.541 --> 01:23.576
It'd be better
if you report that person

01:23.611 --> 01:25.580
to a teacher or another adult.

01:25.614 --> 01:28.553
It's hard to believe
you're not more popular.

01:33.563 --> 01:37.036
<i>You have arrived</i>
<i>at your destination.</i>

01:44.551 --> 01:47.489
So, what am I supposed to do
while you're here?

01:47.524 --> 01:49.226
Maybe go back to sleep
for a bit.

01:49.260 --> 01:50.728
Are you comfortable
in the backseat?

01:50.764 --> 01:53.067
Of course I'm comfortable in
backseats. What do you think?

01:53.101 --> 01:57.107
That is an example of what you
will not say today at school.

01:57.142 --> 01:58.109
Understood?

01:58.144 --> 02:00.380
Fine. Yes. Whatever.

02:02.000 --> 02:08.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:12.372 --> 02:14.208
Anything wrong, seÃ±or?

02:14.276 --> 02:17.815
Other than watching
everything I care about

02:17.850 --> 02:22.190
being taken from me
as I shuffle towards the grave

02:22.225 --> 02:25.431
and having my breakfast
interrupted by another murder...

02:25.465 --> 02:26.432
Not much.

02:29.574 --> 02:31.677
Sykes, your bff just arrived.

02:39.329 --> 02:40.597
Good morning, captain.

02:40.664 --> 02:42.401
Today, we are grieving the loss

02:42.435 --> 02:43.871
of Alon Strauss, 48,

02:43.906 --> 02:46.542
Israeli-born,
naturalized American citizen,

02:46.578 --> 02:48.581
and C.F.O
of Hadera securities,

02:48.615 --> 02:50.585
a multinational
investment firm.

02:50.620 --> 02:52.723
Mr. Strauss answered the door
at 20 after 5:00,

02:52.757 --> 02:56.263
briefcase in hand,
but, um, never made it outside.

02:56.298 --> 02:57.566
He was off to work?

02:57.600 --> 02:59.236
Well, his wife says
he opens the gate

02:59.270 --> 03:01.440
for a limo that picks him up
every morning at 5:30.

03:01.475 --> 03:03.645
We're guessing
Mr. Strauss went to the door

03:03.679 --> 03:05.615
thinking that his driver
had arrived a bit early.

03:05.650 --> 03:07.119
Single shot through the chest.

03:07.153 --> 03:10.526
Bullet exits
between his shoulder blades

03:10.560 --> 03:12.831
and lodged in that far wall.

03:12.899 --> 03:14.467
You think the killer
used a rifle?

03:14.503 --> 03:16.639
More likely
a large-caliber handgun, ma'am.

03:16.673 --> 03:18.776
The wife and son
were sleeping upstairs,

03:18.811 --> 03:20.780
heard a loud shot,
and came running.

03:20.815 --> 03:21.783
That's them.

03:23.521 --> 03:25.424
What about the limo driver?

03:25.458 --> 03:27.496
His story checks out.

03:27.530 --> 03:29.667
What I'm seeing
suggests your basic hit job,

03:29.701 --> 03:32.606
but what I can't figure out...
why no defensive wounds?

03:32.641 --> 03:35.445
If I answer the door
and see some unexpected person

03:35.480 --> 03:37.851
pointing a gun at me,
I'm gonna put up my hands.

03:37.885 --> 03:39.520
I'm gonna turn away.

03:39.555 --> 03:41.191
Strauss did not.

03:41.225 --> 03:42.259
Excuse me.

03:42.294 --> 03:43.629
Ma'am. Ma'am.

03:43.664 --> 03:45.333
I still have a few questions
I need to ask you.

03:45.368 --> 03:47.002
I don't think you understand.

03:47.038 --> 03:49.708
No,
I don't think <i>you</i> understand.

03:49.743 --> 03:53.216
Did anyone else here wake up
to find their husband murdered?

03:54.419 --> 03:56.890
Mrs. Strauss,
I am captain Raydor

03:56.925 --> 03:59.896
of the L.A.P.D.
Major crimes unit.

03:59.931 --> 04:02.535
May I say how very sorry
I am for your loss?

04:02.570 --> 04:04.707
How dare you?

04:04.741 --> 04:06.243
Wha...

04:06.277 --> 04:07.880
how dare you show up?
Get out of my sight!

04:07.914 --> 04:09.683
We are going to get to the
bottom of this, I assure you.

04:09.718 --> 04:11.053
You promised
you would keep him safe.

04:11.087 --> 04:12.389
Shame on you! We are gonna
get to the bottom...

04:12.423 --> 04:13.591
don't you "look, roma" me!

04:13.625 --> 04:14.926
We are gonna get
to the bottom...

04:14.962 --> 04:16.430
that should be you
lying dead on the doorstep!

04:16.464 --> 04:17.933
Agent Howard,
what is going on here?

04:17.968 --> 04:20.471
I'm just here as a liaison.
Morris will be taking the lead.

04:20.540 --> 04:23.043
Hello?!
Sharon, remember me?

04:23.077 --> 04:24.880
First day of school.

04:24.914 --> 04:26.951
Hold on.
One second.

04:26.985 --> 04:28.588
Stay there.

04:29.825 --> 04:31.660
I don't sleep at night.

04:31.729 --> 04:33.498
I-I-I've lost
all interest in baseball.

04:33.567 --> 04:35.603
I look in the mirror,

04:35.637 --> 04:36.872
and I don't recognize
the person looking back at me.

04:36.906 --> 04:37.907
Yes?!

04:39.412 --> 04:40.980
Buzz, what are you doing
right now?

04:41.015 --> 04:42.918
Uh, my job.

04:42.952 --> 04:44.955
Do you know how to get
to St. Joseph's from here?

04:44.989 --> 04:46.525
St. Joseph's?

04:46.559 --> 04:48.763
Has someone forgotten
the L.A.P.D policy

04:48.798 --> 04:51.101
on making requests
for personal favors

04:51.135 --> 04:52.705
from civilian employees?

04:52.739 --> 04:54.775
I'm not doing that.

04:54.809 --> 04:59.017
I am asking for help keeping
a material witness in compliance

04:59.052 --> 05:02.624
with the law regarding
the education of minors.

05:02.659 --> 05:07.034
In that case,
I will withdraw my objection

05:07.068 --> 05:09.071
if, on his way back,

05:09.106 --> 05:12.578
the civilian employee
can pick up a coffee order.

05:12.646 --> 05:13.714
Mm.
What?

05:16.220 --> 05:19.058
Nonfat vanilla latte, and see
what everyone else wants.

05:20.596 --> 05:22.832
"Take the kid to school."
"Go get the coffee."

05:22.867 --> 05:25.004
Hey, and hurry up.
The kid shouldn't be late.

05:26.908 --> 05:28.578
Excuse me, uh,
Mrs. Strauss.

05:28.612 --> 05:30.180
Agent Morris,
your presence here

05:30.215 --> 05:32.953
indicates that this family
is under federal protection.

05:33.021 --> 05:33.988
Almost.

05:34.024 --> 05:35.525
Your victim, Alon Strauss,

05:35.560 --> 05:37.596
was supposed to be
deposed this week,

05:37.630 --> 05:39.634
then they were to be given new
identities and a fresh start.

05:39.702 --> 05:41.538
In Tulsa, Oklahoma!

05:41.573 --> 05:44.778
They wanted to send us away
to Tulsa and give us new names.

05:44.812 --> 05:47.617
Like anyone would believe
we are the McDougals!

05:47.651 --> 05:48.954
Roma, that was one suggestion.

05:48.988 --> 05:50.456
There were
several cities on the list!

05:50.491 --> 05:51.793
No, thank you.
I'm not talking with the FBI!

05:51.827 --> 05:53.162
Mrs. Strauss, Mrs. Strauss,

05:53.230 --> 05:55.935
if I could get
agent Morris out of the way,

05:55.969 --> 05:58.607
would you consider
talking with me?

06:01.113 --> 06:04.518
My husband, Alon,
and his cousin, Ilya,

06:04.553 --> 06:08.528
founded a company together...
Hadera securities.

06:08.562 --> 06:09.863
They were like this.

06:09.931 --> 06:12.602
So your husband and his cousin
were very close.

06:12.637 --> 06:15.208
Yes, and for 20 years,
everyone was so happy.

06:15.242 --> 06:17.078
And why were they so happy?

06:17.113 --> 06:19.650
Was it because Alon and Ilya

06:19.685 --> 06:21.688
were involved
in selling ecstasy?

06:22.958 --> 06:25.329
I don't know, Mrs. Strauss.
Was it?

06:25.363 --> 06:27.133
How should I know?

06:27.167 --> 06:32.109
All I can tell you is that
out of nowhere comes the FBI,

06:32.144 --> 06:34.280
saying that Alon
is going to jail

06:34.315 --> 06:37.755
unless he testifies
against Ilya...

06:37.789 --> 06:41.662
Alon and Ilya...
Who were like this.

06:43.133 --> 06:45.203
But when agent Morris
started asking questions

06:45.238 --> 06:47.141
about what happened
in Pittsburgh,

06:47.175 --> 06:51.283
oh, Alon thought he had
no choice but to turn on Ilya.

06:51.317 --> 06:52.785
What happened in Pittsburgh?

06:52.820 --> 06:54.255
You think you have to
know everything?

06:54.290 --> 06:58.097
Mrs. Strauss, if Ilya Blum

06:58.131 --> 07:00.736
learned that your husband
was cooperating with the FBI...

07:00.771 --> 07:02.272
which seems possible,
okay, and...

07:02.306 --> 07:04.977
and what was he going to say?

07:05.012 --> 07:08.051
And how did Ilya Blum find out
that he was going to say it?

07:08.085 --> 07:10.422
Did you inform anyone
that your family

07:10.456 --> 07:12.694
was entering
the Witness Protection program?

07:15.468 --> 07:16.969
Excuse me.

07:18.006 --> 07:19.241
Avi, have some water.

07:19.275 --> 07:21.178
Mom, um, no, I'm not thirsty.

07:21.246 --> 07:22.247
Why you don't have some water?

07:22.281 --> 07:23.749
Because I'm not thirsty.

07:23.785 --> 07:25.721
So it would kill you
to have a glass of water?

07:26.724 --> 07:29.161
Ballistics confirmed
the bullet is .50 caliber.

07:29.195 --> 07:31.466
Uh, they also discovered
polygonal rifling

07:31.500 --> 07:33.170
along the length,

07:33.204 --> 07:35.474
which ties it to
the Israeli-made desert eagle.

07:35.508 --> 07:38.346
That's a very specific weapon.

07:38.381 --> 07:39.950
Mm-hmm.

07:39.984 --> 07:41.454
Let's start looking
to see who has one of these

07:41.488 --> 07:42.990
registered under their name.

07:44.160 --> 07:45.462
Oh.

07:45.496 --> 07:47.699
There's something
that bothered me about...

07:47.734 --> 07:48.868
The crime scene.

07:48.904 --> 07:50.372
What is it?

07:50.406 --> 07:53.144
I can't remember.

07:53.178 --> 07:54.179
Think about it.

07:54.214 --> 07:55.282
Get back to me.

07:55.316 --> 07:56.183
Right.

07:57.388 --> 07:59.056
Okay, that's enough water.

07:59.090 --> 08:01.261
Stop.

08:04.535 --> 08:06.171
She told no one about Tulsa.

08:06.205 --> 08:07.908
Not a soul, nobody.

08:07.943 --> 08:09.110
Mom.
What?

08:09.145 --> 08:10.112
What? What?!

08:10.147 --> 08:11.316
You tell Thorn everything.

08:11.350 --> 08:12.418
Thorn?

08:13.554 --> 08:14.856
Who's Thorn?

08:14.890 --> 08:16.126
Her life coach.

08:16.193 --> 08:18.196
Life coach?
Y-you have a life coach?

08:18.230 --> 08:22.171
What? You never feel
like you need inspiration,

08:22.205 --> 08:25.110
like you need someone
to help you find the reason

08:25.145 --> 08:26.514
to get up in the morning?

08:26.548 --> 08:28.551
And how does he do that?

08:28.586 --> 08:29.955
Lieutenant, uh, excuse...
but...

08:29.989 --> 08:32.392
Excuse me, l-lieutenant.

08:32.427 --> 08:36.333
Roma... Did you tell
your life coach

08:36.369 --> 08:38.506
about the witness
protection program?

08:38.539 --> 08:41.845
I had to. Thorn is helping
me find myself.

08:41.880 --> 08:45.052
Although neither of us
thought about looking in Tulsa.

08:46.088 --> 08:49.093
Thorn's real name
is Arthur Woodson.

08:49.127 --> 08:53.402
He was either born in Syracuse
in 1965 or Jacksonville in 1969.

08:53.437 --> 08:56.041
His past jobs include
hand model

08:56.075 --> 08:58.914
and, uh, children's party
ventriloquist.

08:58.948 --> 09:02.353
However, lately, he's been
advertising himself as...

09:02.389 --> 09:04.325
"An intuitive life strategist

09:04.359 --> 09:06.963
"helping people
unleash creative thinking

09:06.997 --> 09:08.566
while redefining themselves."

09:08.601 --> 09:10.036
Let me see that.

09:10.071 --> 09:12.107
What happened in Pittsburgh,

09:12.141 --> 09:14.979
and how is Thorn connected
to Hadera securities?

09:15.014 --> 09:18.186
Hadera's core business is
importing ecstasy from Europe,

09:18.221 --> 09:20.558
which nets them
around $3 million a month.

09:20.592 --> 09:23.364
Pittsburgh is one of
their gateways into America.

09:23.399 --> 09:27.974
Hadera is only a front
for a criminal syndicate

09:28.009 --> 09:32.083
operated by six male relatives,
all of them Israeli expats,

09:32.117 --> 09:33.953
all of them living
on L.A.'s West Side.

09:34.022 --> 09:36.358
These guys use
hadera's legitimate businesses

09:36.393 --> 09:38.596
to cover up a lot
of different illegal activities.

09:38.630 --> 09:40.568
Couple of years ago,
they began investing

09:40.602 --> 09:42.037
in low-budget action films,

09:42.071 --> 09:44.041
which, uh, apparently
is a very good way

09:44.075 --> 09:46.213
to hide and launder cash
from the drug trade.

09:46.247 --> 09:47.648
What's the story on the guy

09:47.716 --> 09:49.987
with the, uh, question mark
next to his picture?

09:50.022 --> 09:52.225
Yossi hersch
oversees hadera's film projects.

09:52.259 --> 09:54.129
He was on our radar
till a month ago

09:54.163 --> 09:55.465
when he dropped off the map
in Pittsburgh.

09:55.500 --> 09:56.668
Hasn't been seen since.

09:56.702 --> 09:58.338
And our victim, Alon Strauss,

09:58.372 --> 10:00.175
was prepared to testify
about the ecstasy business?

10:00.209 --> 10:03.248
And other criminal activities
Blum allegedly participates in.

10:03.282 --> 10:05.686
Till half an hour ago,
I would've absolutely said

10:05.721 --> 10:08.592
that no one outside the family
and our agents

10:08.627 --> 10:10.630
knew Strauss was cooperating.

10:10.664 --> 10:13.469
But since roma told this,
uh, Thorn Woodson,

10:13.503 --> 10:16.174
it's hard to say
what might be out there.

10:16.209 --> 10:17.510
Oh, hey.

10:17.544 --> 10:19.447
Now, we have dumped
Thorn Woodson's cell,

10:19.482 --> 10:22.521
and in the past two weeks, he
has had multiple conversations

10:22.555 --> 10:24.391
with all six
of the Hadera wives.

10:24.459 --> 10:25.794
Including roma Strauss?

10:25.828 --> 10:28.265
Especially roma Strauss.
They talked all the time.

10:28.300 --> 10:30.236
This morning,
after she called 911,

10:30.303 --> 10:32.040
she phoned Woodson repeatedly.

10:32.074 --> 10:34.679
That's who she was on
the phone with when we arrived.

10:34.713 --> 10:36.314
So, if Thorn isn't the hit man,

10:36.350 --> 10:38.219
he could've passed on
what he knew about roma

10:38.254 --> 10:40.424
to one of the other women
and from there to Blum.

10:40.458 --> 10:42.261
Exactly.

10:42.329 --> 10:45.835
Well, thank you very
much, agents Howard and Morris.

10:45.869 --> 10:48.607
The information you've given us
will help us move forward.

10:48.642 --> 10:50.611
Goodbye.

10:50.646 --> 10:54.620
Captain, I've discussed
the situation with my superiors.

10:54.654 --> 10:56.290
We've decided
that it would be best

10:56.325 --> 10:57.861
for us to partner up
with the L.A.P.D.

10:57.895 --> 10:59.296
And what's in it for us?

10:59.331 --> 11:01.434
Well, we, uh,
we'd be happy to take care

11:01.469 --> 11:04.375
of your division's overtime
and ancillary expenses.

11:04.409 --> 11:06.746
Of course, the government would
bear the cost of prosecuting.

11:06.780 --> 11:08.717
It's okay.
You had me at overtime.

11:10.588 --> 11:15.106
Lieutenants Flynn and Provenza,
I want to talk to Mr. Thorn.

11:15.231 --> 11:17.435
Aye, aye, captain.

11:17.470 --> 11:19.306
Sanchez, Sykes, come with us

11:19.340 --> 11:21.677
in case this guy turns out
to be our murderer.

11:21.744 --> 11:24.917
Wait, who's gonna
reimburse me for the coffee?

11:24.951 --> 11:28.156
Here.
Put it on the FBI tab.

11:28.190 --> 11:29.993
Enjoy my latte.

11:33.502 --> 11:37.675
What is it I can't remember?

11:37.710 --> 11:41.684
What, what, what?

11:43.875 --> 11:45.845
Maia, of course
it's okay to cry.

11:45.879 --> 11:47.482
Look, if my life strategist

11:47.516 --> 11:49.719
called to say
that he was leaving town,

11:49.787 --> 11:53.360
it would probably trigger my own
irrational fears of abandonment.

11:54.665 --> 11:56.634
Yeah.

11:56.669 --> 11:58.471
We have a search warrant.

11:58.506 --> 11:59.974
He's probably packing up
everything we'd want.

12:00.008 --> 12:01.878
Feels like
you've traveled a long way...

12:01.912 --> 12:03.816
All right, we'll go in
and talk to Thorn.

12:03.851 --> 12:06.487
You and Sanchez
help him with his luggage.

12:09.929 --> 12:11.365
You're not lost.

12:11.399 --> 12:14.738
You have your own
internal GPS system.

12:14.773 --> 12:17.578
Life will shout out at you,

12:17.612 --> 12:21.520
"make a legal u-turn
when possible."

12:21.554 --> 12:24.593
And remember...

12:24.627 --> 12:26.430
Your hands are always
at 10:00 and 2:00

12:26.464 --> 12:28.401
on the steering wheel
of your own heart.

12:28.435 --> 12:32.409
When is feeling vulnerable
a flaw?

12:33.479 --> 12:34.747
Whoa!

12:34.782 --> 12:36.885
Aah! Who are you?

12:36.920 --> 12:38.689
L.A.P.D.
Your front door was open.

12:38.723 --> 12:40.893
Just wanted to make sure
you're not being robbed.

12:40.928 --> 12:43.099
Yeah, keep your hands
where we can see them.

12:43.133 --> 12:44.836
What do you want?

12:44.904 --> 12:48.944
We want to ask you questions
about the death of Alon Strauss

12:48.978 --> 12:50.414
and what you know

12:50.448 --> 12:52.985
about his cousin Ilya
and Hadera securities.

12:53.019 --> 12:54.522
No. No, no, no, no.

12:54.589 --> 12:57.327
I don't have to tell you
anything about Strauss.

12:57.361 --> 12:58.662
It's covered by privilege.

12:58.697 --> 13:00.499
You're not a doctor,
Mr. Woodson.

13:00.535 --> 13:01.669
You don't have privilege.

13:01.704 --> 13:03.038
Are you sure about that?

13:03.106 --> 13:05.042
Because I think
I have privilege.

13:05.110 --> 13:06.378
I do.

13:06.413 --> 13:07.781
If you check the fine print

13:07.815 --> 13:09.551
on the website
where you bought your degree,

13:09.619 --> 13:10.686
you'll realize that you...

13:10.721 --> 13:12.090
I did not buy my degree.

13:15.565 --> 13:17.133
I'm certified

13:17.167 --> 13:19.003
by the Sedona institute
of advanced spiritual learning,

13:19.038 --> 13:20.006
Los Angeles campus.

13:20.040 --> 13:21.710
Where is that?

13:21.744 --> 13:25.384
Oh, well, you know
Santa Monica and Fairfax?

13:25.418 --> 13:27.054
Right across from the whole
foods, there's that strip mall,

13:27.088 --> 13:29.158
and then there's
a nail salon next door.

13:29.193 --> 13:31.931
You go upstairs from that,
and then one building over,

13:31.999 --> 13:33.066
there's that.

13:33.102 --> 13:34.603
That's a traffic school.

13:34.671 --> 13:35.739
During the day.

13:35.773 --> 13:37.744
Listen to me.
You're not a doctor.

13:37.778 --> 13:39.580
I'm more than a doctor.

13:39.615 --> 13:42.921
I don't just "diagnose problems
and prescribe medicine"

13:42.955 --> 13:44.925
or "perform surgeries."

13:44.959 --> 13:48.599
I have remarkable abilities
of perception.

13:48.634 --> 13:51.438
Really?
Yeah.

13:51.473 --> 13:54.779
Tell me about myself...
Anything.

14:04.768 --> 14:06.037
You're divorced.

14:06.071 --> 14:07.239
You have a hole
in your heart so deep

14:07.273 --> 14:08.675
you couldn't fill it
with booze,

14:08.710 --> 14:10.078
so you covered it up
with a badge.

14:10.112 --> 14:11.748
You feel you destroyed
your children's lives,

14:11.783 --> 14:13.753
even though they say
they forgive you.

14:16.126 --> 14:17.660
Is that all you got?

14:17.695 --> 14:20.167
You're smart, cynical,
and tough, and you're...

14:20.201 --> 14:21.803
Cynical and tough.

14:21.838 --> 14:23.974
Look, guys,
even if I don't have privilege,

14:24.009 --> 14:27.181
I'm not gonna share my clients'
secrets with you, okay?

14:27.216 --> 14:28.551
And I've got a lot to do.

14:28.618 --> 14:29.686
Sir.

14:29.721 --> 14:31.023
Guess what we found in his car.

14:31.057 --> 14:33.060
$20,000 in cash.

14:33.128 --> 14:34.731
There was $60,000 in that bag.

14:34.798 --> 14:38.170
Did you steal
$40,000 of my dollars?

14:38.205 --> 14:40.976
May I count my money?

14:43.817 --> 14:49.060
$59,920,
$40, $60, $80, $60,000.

14:49.095 --> 14:51.098
Okay, whew!

14:51.132 --> 14:53.170
That's a lot of small,
unmarked bills

14:53.204 --> 14:55.341
to have in your possession,
Mr. Woodson.

14:55.375 --> 14:57.078
I prefer being paid in cash.

14:57.113 --> 14:59.918
You know who else
prefers to be paid in cash?

14:59.952 --> 15:01.087
Hit men.

15:01.121 --> 15:03.392
I oppose all forms of violence.

15:03.427 --> 15:06.899
What do you know
about the late Alon Strauss?

15:06.933 --> 15:08.737
I may not be a "lawyer"

15:08.771 --> 15:11.276
or understand
"police investigation"...

15:11.310 --> 15:14.248
<i>But I'm pretty sure</i>
<i>that I don't have to answer</i>

15:14.283 --> 15:15.952
<i>everything you ask.</i>

15:15.986 --> 15:18.725
<i>True, but this murder</i>
<i>is rapidly filling up</i>

15:18.759 --> 15:20.862
with the kind of things
our local media love...

15:20.896 --> 15:22.967
drugs, mobsters, a life coach.

15:23.001 --> 15:25.338
Okay, let's
get something straight.

15:25.372 --> 15:26.908
I am not a life coach.

15:26.942 --> 15:28.879
Life coaches
are complete bullshit.

15:30.149 --> 15:31.985
I'm an intuitive
life strategist.

15:32.019 --> 15:33.756
What's the difference?

15:33.790 --> 15:36.728
Life coaches
are cheerleaders and bullies.

15:36.763 --> 15:38.332
I help people
re-establish contact

15:38.366 --> 15:39.869
with their intimate selves

15:39.903 --> 15:41.739
so they can re-balance
their perspective

15:41.774 --> 15:44.110
and reclaim their proper place
in the world.

15:44.145 --> 15:45.179
How much
do you charge for that?

15:45.215 --> 15:46.416
$500 an hour.

15:46.450 --> 15:49.789
Oh. Oh, so 15 minutes
would be, uh...

15:49.823 --> 15:51.760
excuse me, lieutenant.

15:51.795 --> 15:55.300
Thorn, if you didn't
murder Mr. Strauss

15:55.334 --> 15:58.241
and you won't help us
find the killer,

15:58.275 --> 16:02.182
you may very well be the next
victim in this crime spree.

16:04.521 --> 16:06.190
You went through
all of his stuff?

16:06.225 --> 16:08.094
Yeah,
Thorn has no desert eagle.

16:08.162 --> 16:10.099
Yeah, a lot of tie-dye t-shirts,
trail mix,

16:10.166 --> 16:12.370
and, uh, Celtic meditation CDs.

16:12.405 --> 16:14.107
No gun.

16:14.142 --> 16:18.049
But we did find an interesting
outline for a screenplay.

16:18.083 --> 16:20.086
"The ecstasy and the agony:

16:20.121 --> 16:24.329
My year as intuitive life
strategist to the Israeli mob."

16:24.363 --> 16:25.932
<i>Why are you dragging me</i>
<i>into all this, okay?</i>

16:25.966 --> 16:27.201
<i>Until a few hours ago,</i>
<i>I didn't know</i>

16:27.236 --> 16:28.770
<i>about any ecstasy smuggling,</i>

16:28.805 --> 16:29.806
<i>and when I did</i>
<i>find out about it,</i>

16:29.874 --> 16:31.376
<i>"I was like, " whoo-hoo!</i>

16:31.410 --> 16:33.314
<i>You know, I did not</i>
<i>sign up for this, guys."</i>

16:33.348 --> 16:34.817
Dates, names.

16:34.852 --> 16:38.057
We should've wired up
the women's phones.

16:38.091 --> 16:40.797
<i>Come on, they're</i>
<i>a bunch of Hollywood wives.</i>

16:40.831 --> 16:42.100
<i>Their husbands produce</i>
<i>low-budget movies.</i>

16:42.134 --> 16:43.202
<i>Am I right?</i>

16:43.236 --> 16:44.371
Tell us about Pittsburgh.

16:44.405 --> 16:46.008
Uh... regularly chosen

16:46.042 --> 16:48.913
as one of America's
best places to raise children

16:48.948 --> 16:50.985
<i>and has a large</i>
<i>Polish population.</i>

16:51.019 --> 16:52.421
Page 19 of Thorn's opus.

16:52.456 --> 16:55.027
"The Pittsburgh screening
of their next film,

16:55.062 --> 16:57.566
'excessive impact, '
was an unmitified disaster."

16:57.600 --> 16:58.869
"Unmitified"?

16:58.903 --> 17:00.371
What is unmitified?

17:00.405 --> 17:04.213
"And afterwards, the boss
took Nossi Gersh for a ride,

17:04.247 --> 17:06.017
and he never came back."

17:06.050 --> 17:07.654
<i>Something terrible</i>
<i>happened in Pittsburgh.</i>

17:07.688 --> 17:08.656
<i>Roma Strauss...</i>

17:08.691 --> 17:10.227
I'll take a wild guess

17:10.261 --> 17:12.030
that "Nossi Gersh"
refers to Yossi Hersch.

17:12.065 --> 17:13.901
<i>She talks to you</i>
<i>about everything.</i>

17:13.969 --> 17:15.337
Excuse me.

17:15.371 --> 17:16.906
<i>Look, I don't know</i>
<i>how to tell you this,</i>

17:16.974 --> 17:18.977
but except for
a regional theater production

17:19.011 --> 17:20.580
of "man of LA mancha"
when I was 22,

17:20.648 --> 17:23.219
Pittsburgh has never been
a very big part of my life.

17:24.690 --> 17:27.094
Captain, can I speak to you?

17:31.102 --> 17:33.339
You must have been
pretty close to roma

17:33.374 --> 17:34.976
if she called you

17:35.011 --> 17:37.948
five minutes after finding
her husband's body.

17:37.983 --> 17:39.218
Yes, well...

17:39.252 --> 17:42.492
The woman
was in complete shock.

17:42.526 --> 17:46.032
Mr. Woodson,
you've told us several times

17:46.066 --> 17:48.604
that you didn't share
what you know with anyone.

17:48.639 --> 17:50.609
Explain this!

17:50.643 --> 17:54.283
Uh, that is a pitch
for a motion picture

17:54.318 --> 17:55.620
or a television series, maybe,

17:55.654 --> 17:57.256
but it's registered
with the writers guild,

17:57.291 --> 17:58.592
so don't think
you can steal it.

17:58.627 --> 18:00.296
Who's seen this?

18:00.330 --> 18:01.631
Nobody.

18:01.666 --> 18:03.702
I mean, you know,
a couple of guys at fx

18:03.736 --> 18:05.473
and, uh, someone at showtime

18:05.507 --> 18:07.377
who thought it sounded
a little too much like "weeds."

18:07.411 --> 18:09.749
You're saying
you floated this document

18:09.783 --> 18:11.686
in front of how many people?

18:11.720 --> 18:15.293
Like not even 15,
and they were all executives.

18:15.328 --> 18:17.397
<i>It's not like any of them</i>
<i>actually read it.</i>

18:17.431 --> 18:19.368
Oh, my God,
are you hearing this?

18:19.402 --> 18:21.573
<i>Guys, lighten up.</i>

18:21.607 --> 18:24.278
Look, I used
an undecipherable code

18:24.313 --> 18:26.450
to conceal their identities.

18:26.484 --> 18:28.187
Did this undecipherable code

18:28.221 --> 18:30.491
involve altering
the first letters of names

18:30.525 --> 18:32.629
and leaving
everything else unchanged?

18:32.664 --> 18:34.667
Wow.

18:34.701 --> 18:36.704
You guys really <i>are</i> good.

18:38.309 --> 18:39.543
Yes.

18:39.578 --> 18:42.750
I wrote about
what these women told me,

18:42.784 --> 18:44.586
but in my defense,
I exaggerated.

18:44.621 --> 18:47.426
What did you know for sure?

18:47.460 --> 18:49.397
That Alon was
cooperating with the FBI

18:49.432 --> 18:51.335
in their investigation
of Ilya Blum,

18:51.369 --> 18:53.272
and he knew something
about what happened

18:53.306 --> 18:54.541
to Yossi hersch in Pittsburgh.

19:03.695 --> 19:06.366
We need to pick up
Ilya Blum now.

19:06.400 --> 19:10.140
Blum has been under surveillance
24/7 for the past two months,

19:10.175 --> 19:12.444
and we know he was at home this
morning when Strauss was shot.

19:12.479 --> 19:13.814
He's made no attempt to flee.

19:13.849 --> 19:15.718
Because as far
as he's concerned,

19:15.753 --> 19:17.355
- he's eliminated the threat.
- At the very least,

19:17.389 --> 19:19.326
we should get a warrant
to search Blum's home.

19:19.360 --> 19:20.328
We've already done that.

19:20.395 --> 19:22.332
When?
Three weeks ago.

19:22.366 --> 19:23.534
Blum is a foreign national.

19:23.569 --> 19:25.337
Fisa granted
a secret search warrant.

19:25.405 --> 19:27.375
Our people went through
his house from top to bottom

19:27.409 --> 19:28.377
while he was out of town.

19:28.411 --> 19:30.648
And?

19:30.683 --> 19:33.187
Blum keeps a desert eagle
handgun in his bedside drawer.

19:33.221 --> 19:36.794
You knew our victim
was killed with a desert eagle

19:36.829 --> 19:38.564
and that Blum had one,

19:38.598 --> 19:41.771
and you chose to conceal
this information?

19:41.806 --> 19:43.442
How do you justify that?!

19:43.476 --> 19:44.844
We're about to roll up
an international drug ring

19:44.879 --> 19:46.748
after two years
of investigation.

19:46.783 --> 19:48.319
If you pick up Blum right now,

19:48.353 --> 19:49.621
even if we get him
for the Strauss murder,

19:49.655 --> 19:51.893
we lose our ability
to close this network.

19:51.927 --> 19:54.766
Blum will be replaced,
and the drugs keep coming.

19:54.800 --> 19:57.237
Fine. You'll get your arrest
and your shipment.

19:57.271 --> 19:59.809
We'll get Blum out of his house,
remove the gun,

19:59.843 --> 20:01.412
and see if it matches
our casings.

20:01.447 --> 20:03.449
How are you gonna do that
without tipping our hand?

20:03.484 --> 20:06.623
Captain, I'm sorry to interrupt,
but I think this is important.

20:20.965 --> 20:24.627
Look captain, I understand
having Ilya Blum

20:24.752 --> 20:27.383
come here to comfort his cousins wife.

20:27.508 --> 20:29.946
Works fine
getting him out of his house.

20:29.980 --> 20:32.584
But what is the point
of trying to stage

20:32.618 --> 20:35.323
this big confrontation
in our murder room?

20:35.357 --> 20:37.361
The FBI assumes our homicide

20:37.396 --> 20:39.599
is connected
to the ecstasy trade,

20:39.633 --> 20:40.901
and I'm beginning to think

20:40.936 --> 20:42.772
that it's a little
more personal than that.

20:42.806 --> 20:44.009
Captain.

20:44.043 --> 20:46.513
These are volatile people.

20:46.548 --> 20:50.356
If roma or Blum
or even this Thorn character

20:50.390 --> 20:52.560
begin to start a fight...

20:52.595 --> 20:54.631
then one of them
could say something

20:54.666 --> 20:56.402
that they will live to regret,

20:56.470 --> 20:58.539
and they are more likely
to say it to each other

20:58.573 --> 20:59.842
than they are to one of us.

20:59.877 --> 21:01.078
You don't understand.

21:01.146 --> 21:02.882
Lieutenant,
I told you what I want done.

21:02.916 --> 21:05.521
Do I really need
to phrase this as an order?

21:08.427 --> 21:12.602
I'm sorry to keep you
waiting so long, father.

21:13.939 --> 21:17.546
It's been an extraordinarily
busy day here.

21:17.580 --> 21:20.618
As I was saying,
honesty is at the core

21:20.686 --> 21:22.489
of the St. Joseph's
honor code,

21:22.523 --> 21:26.897
and rusty introduced himself
to his new classmates with lies.

21:26.932 --> 21:28.200
Such as?

21:28.234 --> 21:30.838
They asked me what I did
over summer vacation.

21:30.873 --> 21:33.711
I said that I was involved
in catching a serial killer

21:33.745 --> 21:36.818
and that I would be a material
witness in his murder trial.

21:36.852 --> 21:39.522
I thought we decided
not to discuss those things

21:39.557 --> 21:41.093
with the other students.

21:41.127 --> 21:43.197
So he was telling the truth?

21:43.231 --> 21:44.800
I am afraid so.

21:44.835 --> 21:46.069
This fight...
did you start it?

21:46.104 --> 21:47.639
No.

21:47.674 --> 21:49.143
But I finished it, just like
I'll finish the next one

21:49.178 --> 21:50.679
and the one after that.

21:50.714 --> 21:52.283
Our school has
zero tolerance for fighting.

21:52.317 --> 21:54.020
Yeah, well, that's fine with me

21:54.055 --> 21:56.058
because I have a zero tolerance
for getting hit in the face.

21:56.092 --> 21:58.763
Captain, when you approached us

21:58.798 --> 22:00.867
about taking on rusty
as a student,

22:00.902 --> 22:03.673
we raised concerns
that you asked us to overlook.

22:03.708 --> 22:08.752
We tried, and it just doesn't
seem to be a good fit.

22:08.786 --> 22:12.193
Let's review the events
as I understand them.

22:12.228 --> 22:15.968
Rusty was asked
what he did over the summer.

22:16.002 --> 22:17.270
He told the truth.

22:17.305 --> 22:19.175
He was assaulted
and defended himself,

22:19.209 --> 22:21.580
and now you're
trying to throw him out.

22:21.614 --> 22:23.216
What about the boy
who attacked him?

22:23.250 --> 22:26.823
It was three boys,
and they will be punished...

22:26.857 --> 22:28.327
after they get out
of the infirmary.

22:32.904 --> 22:35.842
And expelled?

22:35.877 --> 22:37.846
Consider my position.
I am.

22:37.881 --> 22:40.652
I am also considering
the message that you send

22:40.686 --> 22:42.723
by turning away
an abandoned boy.

22:42.757 --> 22:46.164
Is that the example that you
want our congregation to follow?

22:46.199 --> 22:50.374
I am concerned with the safety
of my other students.

22:50.408 --> 22:52.979
And what about their souls?

22:53.013 --> 22:56.052
Do you worry that they hear
one thing at mass

22:56.087 --> 22:58.224
and another thing at school?

23:00.362 --> 23:01.363
I see you're determined.

23:01.398 --> 23:02.933
Mm-hmm.

23:07.443 --> 23:10.782
Let me... Consult
with the faculty.

23:10.817 --> 23:13.220
Father,
I want to be clear here.

23:13.254 --> 23:15.826
If rusty is not
re-admitted tomorrow,

23:15.860 --> 23:18.130
I will be taking other actions.

23:19.434 --> 23:20.402
Do you understand?

23:20.436 --> 23:21.871
Yes, captain.

23:22.941 --> 23:24.009
I get it.

23:29.354 --> 23:31.759
Sharon, that was great!

23:31.793 --> 23:33.863
How dare you hurt
those other boys so badly?

23:33.897 --> 23:34.932
What?!

23:34.967 --> 23:36.335
You put them in the infirmary

23:36.370 --> 23:38.240
because you hit them
harder than you had to,

23:38.307 --> 23:39.777
and you know it.

23:39.811 --> 23:41.179
I want you to stay here.

23:41.213 --> 23:43.751
I want you to think
about why you were so mad

23:43.819 --> 23:46.890
and why you are throwing away
an opportunity

23:46.925 --> 23:49.129
to change your life
for the better.

23:49.164 --> 23:51.066
Do you want me
to stand in the corner, too?

23:51.101 --> 23:52.937
If that will help you think
this through, by all means.

23:54.273 --> 23:55.776
Excuse me, captain.

23:55.843 --> 23:58.180
Roma and Thorn are set up
the way you wanted them.

23:58.216 --> 24:00.819
The phone call you asked us
to make to Ilya Blum worked.

24:00.854 --> 24:03.425
Lieutenant Flynn is bringing him
up in the elevator right now.

24:03.460 --> 24:05.429
Should I tell everyone
we're ready to begin?

24:05.464 --> 24:06.833
Yes.

24:23.937 --> 24:25.472
Something the matter,
lieutenant?

24:25.507 --> 24:26.841
Maybe I can help.

24:26.876 --> 24:28.913
I seriously doubt that.

24:28.947 --> 24:31.986
Perhaps I'm a stranger
to the world of law enforcement,

24:32.020 --> 24:34.891
but... I am an expert
in the human heart,

24:34.926 --> 24:37.464
and if you're suffering
emotional pain, I can help.

24:37.498 --> 24:38.966
Emotional pain... me?

24:39.903 --> 24:41.605
No, no, no, no.

24:41.640 --> 24:44.277
I... I'm worried
about a good friend who...

24:44.312 --> 24:49.321
Well, let's just say
he's lost a bit of his drive.

24:50.559 --> 24:54.399
I-it's not that my friend
doesn't like his job.

24:54.466 --> 24:58.673
It's just that there
have been some changes recently,

24:58.708 --> 25:02.014
unfair changes...
the kind of changes

25:02.048 --> 25:04.920
that would drive a dedicated,

25:04.988 --> 25:09.329
responsible, easygoing guy
like him crazy.

25:09.364 --> 25:11.233
I mean, just thinking
about the situation

25:11.267 --> 25:13.337
makes me want to put
my fist through a wall!

25:13.372 --> 25:16.678
And your friend feels
as strongly about all this

25:16.712 --> 25:18.080
as you do?

25:18.114 --> 25:19.317
What friend?

25:19.351 --> 25:20.652
Oh.

25:20.687 --> 25:23.025
My friend, my...

25:23.059 --> 25:28.402
My friend is, well,
a little lost, frankly.

25:28.436 --> 25:33.446
I'd like
to try and help the guy...

25:33.480 --> 25:34.648
Find himself.

25:37.756 --> 25:39.425
Are you close
to finding the killer?

25:39.459 --> 25:41.095
No. As far as we can tell,
everybody loved the guy.

25:41.129 --> 25:42.631
Me too.

25:42.666 --> 25:46.472
Alon and I, we were like this.

25:46.507 --> 25:48.176
That's why we called you, sir,

25:48.210 --> 25:50.046
and I'm sure his widow
will appreciate you coming down.

26:01.237 --> 26:03.507
You?!
What are you doing here?!

26:03.542 --> 26:05.278
Uh, anger and fear.

26:05.312 --> 26:06.580
You're angry.

26:06.615 --> 26:08.384
Ah, ah, ah.
Flight impulses!

26:08.452 --> 26:10.187
You ruined everything!
No.

26:10.222 --> 26:15.365
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, my God!

26:15.400 --> 26:17.136
Before you, everyone was happy!

26:17.170 --> 26:19.107
After you,
everything goes to hell!

26:19.141 --> 26:21.546
How dare you
speak to him that way?!

26:21.580 --> 26:23.683
He's 10 times
the man that you are!

26:23.717 --> 26:25.320
Ah, so that's what it takes

26:25.354 --> 26:27.257
to screw every woman
in the family, huh?

26:27.325 --> 26:29.428
You don't know anything!

26:29.462 --> 26:30.597
What?

26:30.631 --> 26:32.467
You think he
only makes sexy with you?

26:32.502 --> 26:35.106
He makes sexy with everyone,
including my Aliza!

26:35.174 --> 26:37.110
He never did!

26:37.178 --> 26:38.881
Alon told me
you wanted to divorce him

26:38.915 --> 26:40.384
because you're
in love with prick.

26:40.418 --> 26:41.753
Thorn.
Whatever.

26:41.787 --> 26:43.257
So what?

26:43.291 --> 26:46.697
You don't think I deserve him?

26:46.732 --> 26:47.866
Oh, I could kill you myself.

26:47.901 --> 26:50.572
Don't you threaten me.

26:50.606 --> 26:52.442
I know things.

26:55.216 --> 26:57.719
Here.
These are for you.

26:57.755 --> 26:58.822
Rugelach, you bitch.

26:58.890 --> 27:00.759
You probably
murdered Alon yourself!

27:00.794 --> 27:02.663
And why would I murder Alon

27:02.731 --> 27:05.603
when you were going to
do it for me?!

27:07.408 --> 27:09.812
Kill him.

27:11.250 --> 27:12.585
Kill him.

27:12.619 --> 27:16.193
Thorn, y-you weren't
really sleeping

27:16.260 --> 27:17.562
with anyone else, were you?

27:17.597 --> 27:19.433
Roma, just remember
what I told you.

27:19.468 --> 27:21.204
Yes-and-no questions
are a trap.

27:30.658 --> 27:34.832
Can believe the mouth
on that man?

27:34.866 --> 27:36.535
Oh, that miserable bastard!

27:36.570 --> 27:37.670
I could kill him!

27:39.041 --> 27:41.312
All this is because
of that miserable prick!

27:41.346 --> 27:43.316
Thorn.
Whatever.

27:43.351 --> 27:45.320
<i>Ever since he spends time</i>
<i>with the women,</i>

27:45.355 --> 27:46.990
<i>they're talking</i>
<i>about their feelings,</i>

27:47.024 --> 27:48.727
asking questions
about my feelings.

27:48.761 --> 27:50.697
Tell me, what business
is it for a wife

27:50.731 --> 27:52.401
to know her husband's feelings?

27:52.435 --> 27:54.371
Please, have a seat.

27:54.405 --> 27:56.376
If you and Thorn
were having an affair

27:56.410 --> 27:58.747
and he admits
that the two of you

27:58.781 --> 27:59.915
were planning
something together...

27:59.950 --> 28:01.452
you want to know
what we planned?

28:01.486 --> 28:02.922
Hmm?
A divorce.

28:02.956 --> 28:05.326
And then Alon says
we are moving to Tulsa, and...

28:05.361 --> 28:06.696
pfft!... All gone.

28:06.730 --> 28:09.602
I wasn't going anywhere
with roma... ever.

28:09.637 --> 28:10.704
You were intimate with her.

28:10.739 --> 28:11.806
That's my job.

28:11.840 --> 28:13.443
I'm intimate with everybody.

28:13.477 --> 28:17.317
Including all six wives of
half a dozen Israeli mobsters.

28:17.351 --> 28:18.753
Who make movies.

28:18.788 --> 28:22.428
I'm an actor, too,
and a ventriloquist.

28:22.462 --> 28:26.737
Mr. Thorn
has many girlfriends.

28:26.771 --> 28:29.643
And you...
you are divorced five times?

28:29.677 --> 28:31.013
Well, yeah.

28:31.047 --> 28:35.054
Yeah, but I didn't sleep
with all my wives at once.

28:35.089 --> 28:36.491
No overlap?

28:36.526 --> 28:37.994
Well...

28:38.028 --> 28:42.503
Maybe I wasn't always as good
a guy as I should've been.

28:42.538 --> 28:43.772
What's troubling you

28:43.808 --> 28:45.911
is not your present,
it's your past.

28:45.945 --> 28:48.115
As I used to tell
my writing students,

28:48.149 --> 28:50.152
a problem
on page 20 of our story

28:50.186 --> 28:53.660
often means we should
go back and look at page 5.

28:53.694 --> 28:56.667
What's your page-5 problem,
lieutenant?

28:56.701 --> 29:02.913
Well there was
once when I was 12 years old

29:02.948 --> 29:06.621
that I took this... Hey.

29:06.656 --> 29:09.194
Hey, we're... we're here
to talk about <i>you,</i> not <i>me.</i>

29:09.228 --> 29:10.730
And why is that?

29:10.764 --> 29:11.933
Because you're under arrest.

29:11.967 --> 29:14.471
It's your heart
that's under arrest.

29:14.506 --> 29:17.545
In fact, I think it may be
in solitary confinement.

29:17.914 --> 29:19.851
<i>Look, Alon and I,</i>
<i>we were very close.</i>

29:19.885 --> 29:21.521
I go with his last 20 years.

29:21.555 --> 29:23.392
<i>We come here.</i>

29:23.426 --> 29:24.660
Yeah?

29:24.695 --> 29:25.830
Sorry to interrupt, lieutenant,

29:25.865 --> 29:27.568
but we started
with the night table

29:27.602 --> 29:30.874
and then looked everywhere that
Blum might've hidden the gun.

29:30.909 --> 29:33.347
The desert eagle
is definitely not here.

29:33.381 --> 29:35.384
Thanks, Julio.

29:35.419 --> 29:36.286
No gun?

29:37.323 --> 29:39.026
If you and Alon were like this,

29:39.060 --> 29:40.863
you must've known
that he and his wife

29:40.897 --> 29:42.567
were having marital problems.

29:42.601 --> 29:45.440
I found out two weeks ago when
they came over for dinner...

29:45.474 --> 29:46.809
him and his family.

29:46.843 --> 29:49.715
<i>Alon tells me</i>
<i>the cow wants a divorce.</i>

29:50.751 --> 29:52.086
<i>Just like this.</i>

29:52.121 --> 29:54.324
Buzz, could you bring up
the crime-scene video?

29:54.358 --> 29:56.328
She called the shots, <i>huh?</i>

29:56.363 --> 29:57.798
Anything in particular?

29:57.832 --> 29:59.535
Did you get a shot of the door?

30:03.812 --> 30:05.480
Yeah, right there.

30:05.515 --> 30:07.952
Could you enlarge that picture?

30:10.793 --> 30:13.631
Peephole to the door is open.

30:13.665 --> 30:16.069
That's what
I was trying to remember.

30:16.104 --> 30:18.976
Alon Strauss opened the door
for someone he knew and trusted.

30:20.512 --> 30:22.483
Roma was at Blum's house
two weeks ago,

30:22.517 --> 30:24.454
and now his great, big gun
is missing.

30:24.488 --> 30:26.625
And I'm thinking we didn't
search the Strauss home

30:26.659 --> 30:27.960
as well as we might have.

30:27.996 --> 30:30.132
You want to search it again? No.

30:30.166 --> 30:31.701
I have a better idea.

30:37.731 --> 30:41.705
I'm going to be gone for
hours on a stakeout with the FBI,

30:41.739 --> 30:44.277
so your case worker, Cynthia,
has volunteered

30:44.312 --> 30:46.683
to sit with you tonight
while I am at work.

30:46.717 --> 30:48.553
Wow, I'm so honored.

30:48.588 --> 30:51.993
While I'm gone,
in addition to considering

30:52.028 --> 30:54.265
your future at St. Joseph's,

30:54.300 --> 30:58.741
you could think
about the word "civility"

30:58.776 --> 31:00.344
and if it might be proper

31:00.378 --> 31:02.281
to treat me
with the same respect

31:02.315 --> 31:04.052
as I am showing you.

31:14.642 --> 31:16.979
We are very sorry to have
kept you away from home all day,

31:17.013 --> 31:18.515
especially given
what's happened.

31:18.583 --> 31:19.984
W-why do you have to
come back later?

31:20.019 --> 31:22.023
We believe the killer
and the weapon are long gone,

31:22.057 --> 31:24.762
but if we don't
search your home thoroughly,

31:24.797 --> 31:27.100
it may be seen
as a major misstep on our part.

31:27.135 --> 31:28.671
So go on about your business,

31:28.705 --> 31:30.475
and we'll come back
with a warrant

31:30.509 --> 31:32.479
so we can
look through your house.

31:32.513 --> 31:34.717
I'm really, really, really
sorry about the inconvenience.

31:34.784 --> 31:37.389
Mom, l-let's go.

31:37.423 --> 31:40.062
God, don't you even care about
what happened to dad at all?

31:40.129 --> 31:42.467
Oh, so now he's dead,
he's a Saint?

31:42.501 --> 31:44.804
Forgive me for being relieved
that we're not involved

31:44.839 --> 31:48.011
in drug dealing
and God knows what else, avi.

31:53.189 --> 31:55.594
Why... why are you
making me yell at you?

31:55.661 --> 31:58.433
Can't you just say,
"okay, mom"?

32:08.622 --> 32:10.090
So, we're driving
around the block

32:10.124 --> 32:12.528
after telling the suspect
we're going to search her house?

32:12.563 --> 32:15.768
Now can you tell me
what I missed?

32:19.043 --> 32:21.481
Alon Strauss is informing
on his cousin Ilya.

32:21.516 --> 32:23.952
Someone knocks on the door
at 5:20 in the morning.

32:23.987 --> 32:27.093
Alon looks through his peephole,
sees his cousin standing there.

32:27.128 --> 32:28.763
Is he gonna open the door?

32:28.797 --> 32:31.535
Right, so it had to be somebody
that he knew and trusted

32:31.570 --> 32:34.108
and someone he wouldn't think
was trying to kill him.

32:34.142 --> 32:35.978
And someone who had Ilya's gun,

32:36.013 --> 32:37.982
which is why we're gonna
be watching our victim's house

32:38.016 --> 32:39.285
the rest of the night.

32:39.319 --> 32:40.954
Thanks, Morris.
Keep me posted.

32:40.989 --> 32:42.658
Is Blum
at L.A.X already?

32:42.692 --> 32:43.994
Waiting for the courier.

32:44.029 --> 32:45.698
Once Morris makes the arrest,

32:45.732 --> 32:48.604
I think the ecstasy operation
is pretty much history.

32:48.638 --> 32:50.173
As for the murder charges

32:50.208 --> 32:52.110
related to Yossi hersch
disappearing in Pittsburgh...

32:52.145 --> 32:56.119
let's wrap up the murder
of Mr. Strauss first, please.

33:00.028 --> 33:01.330
Everyone will be expecting it,

33:01.364 --> 33:03.535
but no one will actually eat
the egg salad.

33:03.569 --> 33:04.837
Hold it.
Hold it, mommy.

33:04.872 --> 33:06.106
What?

33:06.142 --> 33:07.676
Is it okay
if I hang somewhere else?

33:07.710 --> 33:09.948
No one who's coming over
even cares about dad.

33:09.982 --> 33:11.284
I'd rather not listen.

33:12.921 --> 33:14.089
Yes.

33:14.123 --> 33:15.993
But don't worry.

33:16.027 --> 33:18.965
I'm going to get you
a better father.

33:19.000 --> 33:20.034
Okay, bubela?

33:28.352 --> 33:30.623
No, listen to me, mommy.
Listen.

33:37.338 --> 33:38.940
Going somewhere, avi?

33:51.100 --> 33:53.103
Mind if we take a look
in your pack?

34:05.966 --> 34:08.969
I'm grounded
if I come home after 9:00,

34:09.005 --> 34:13.045
a-and all along, my father
was a glorified drug dealer?

34:13.080 --> 34:15.384
W-why should <i>I</i>
<i>have to live in Tulsa</i>

34:15.418 --> 34:17.088
because <i>he</i> was a criminal?

34:17.121 --> 34:18.357
You killed your father

34:18.391 --> 34:20.730
because you didn't want
to move to Oklahoma.

34:20.764 --> 34:22.434
And lose my friends and...

34:22.467 --> 34:26.175
and everything else
that mattered to me in my life.

34:26.208 --> 34:27.377
All 14 years.

34:27.411 --> 34:30.083
You had no other alternatives?

34:30.117 --> 34:32.755
<i>Well, we...</i>
<i>we were out of alternatives.</i>

34:32.789 --> 34:34.257
<i>Don't... don't you get it?</i>

34:34.292 --> 34:36.529
<i>I-I wasn't going to be</i>
<i>someone else</i>

34:36.563 --> 34:39.067
<i>f-from now</i>
<i>until the day that I died.</i>

34:39.101 --> 34:41.938
<i>I-I want to be who...</i>
<i>I want to be who I am!</i>

34:48.554 --> 34:50.188
This can go
one of two ways, Mrs. Strauss.

34:50.223 --> 34:53.094
We can leave your son
with the L.A.P.D.

34:53.130 --> 34:54.931
They'll pass him off
to the D.A.

34:54.966 --> 34:56.002
We'll try him as an adult.

34:56.036 --> 34:57.437
And with that confession,

34:57.472 --> 35:00.043
he'll spend the rest of his life
or the best part of it

35:00.078 --> 35:02.347
in prison.

35:02.382 --> 35:03.984
Or what?

35:04.019 --> 35:05.989
This afternoon,
you said you knew things.

35:06.023 --> 35:08.361
Does that include
what happened in Pittsburgh?

35:08.395 --> 35:11.200
'Cause if it does, the FBI
can get the district attorney

35:11.234 --> 35:14.173
to treat avi
as a juvenile offender.

35:14.207 --> 35:17.481
And then he'd be out by the time
he's 25 or maybe sooner.

35:17.515 --> 35:20.019
Although we have to
convince prosecution

35:20.053 --> 35:22.191
that there
were mitigating factors

35:22.226 --> 35:23.627
in your husband's murder.

35:26.334 --> 35:28.303
We went to Pittsburgh,
all of us...

35:28.337 --> 35:30.307
husbands, wives, children...

35:30.342 --> 35:34.015
for a screening of our new film,
"excessive impact."

35:34.050 --> 35:36.153
And...

35:36.188 --> 35:41.565
And when it was over,
oh, Ilya was so angry.

35:41.599 --> 35:44.671
And he said to Yossi...
he said, "where is the scene"

35:44.705 --> 35:47.444
with the helicopter crashing
into the jet?"

35:47.478 --> 35:50.250
This was the big scene
in the movie, a crash,

35:50.284 --> 35:52.420
and it wasn't in the film

35:52.454 --> 35:57.331
because Yossi had taken
all that money and spent it

35:57.365 --> 36:01.105
on clothes
at Paul Smith and Barneys.

36:01.139 --> 36:04.645
And so Ilya
took Yossi for a ride,

36:04.679 --> 36:07.719
and Yossi, who was at least
already dressed for his funeral,

36:07.754 --> 36:09.222
never came back.

36:09.256 --> 36:12.362
You saw them
get in the vehicle together?

36:12.397 --> 36:14.266
You'll testify to that?

36:16.605 --> 36:18.141
What about avi?

36:25.757 --> 36:28.495
Beneath it all,
he was protecting his mother.

36:28.530 --> 36:31.101
I know it.

36:32.705 --> 36:37.414
You can't take away a boy's
whole life for that, can you?

36:37.448 --> 36:38.649
No.

36:43.917 --> 36:45.820
So, Blum goes to prison
for drug trafficking,

36:45.854 --> 36:46.889
roma's off
to Witness Protection,

36:46.923 --> 36:48.358
her son's arrested for murder,

36:48.392 --> 36:50.822
and I get to walk out
a free man?

36:51.602 --> 36:52.801
Go figure, huh?

36:52.835 --> 36:54.691
Wow!

36:54.816 --> 36:56.917
Y... what about my money?

36:59.082 --> 37:02.254
Don't worry...
we didn't take much.

37:02.288 --> 37:03.824
Well, this cash is nothing

37:03.858 --> 37:06.028
compared to what I'm gonna get
selling my life story.

37:06.063 --> 37:07.432
Forget about
the film treatment.

37:07.466 --> 37:08.801
What?

37:08.868 --> 37:10.905
Yeah, technically,
that's not yours anymore.

37:10.939 --> 37:13.978
Now it's more like,
uh, federal evidence.

37:14.012 --> 37:15.781
But it's my life.

37:15.816 --> 37:17.551
And one day, you can sell it.

37:17.586 --> 37:20.632
Yeah, after everyone
you named in it is dead.

37:21.444 --> 37:23.355
Wow. Setback.

37:23.480 --> 37:27.505
Yeah, well, speaking
of setbacks and dying,

37:27.938 --> 37:30.008
several of our suspects

37:30.042 --> 37:33.949
would like to plan and attend
your funeral.

37:33.984 --> 37:36.088
So you might want
to take that money

37:36.123 --> 37:38.593
someplace where
you won't be recognized.

37:38.627 --> 37:40.464
Latin America, for example.

37:40.498 --> 37:41.967
What am I gonna do there?

37:42.035 --> 37:43.638
I don't speak Latin.

37:43.705 --> 37:46.577
Well, you're all about fresh
starts and finding yourself.

37:46.611 --> 37:49.483
This time,
I actually liked where I was.

37:49.517 --> 37:51.220
And I was making a difference.

37:51.254 --> 37:55.027
But you were sleeping
with half a dozen married women.

37:55.061 --> 37:56.998
Yeah, I was a little tired,
I'll admit it,

37:57.032 --> 37:58.668
but some of them
were fairly attractive,

37:58.702 --> 38:00.004
and they were paying me.

38:00.038 --> 38:03.813
You know, that sounds
like the kind of business

38:03.847 --> 38:07.186
that you could
probably start up anywhere.

38:07.220 --> 38:08.756
Hey.

38:10.060 --> 38:11.061
You know,
there's something to that.

38:12.632 --> 38:14.001
I don't usually
believe in free advice,

38:14.035 --> 38:16.639
but because you've been
so open with me...

38:16.674 --> 38:19.814
I'm gonna tell you
how I think your <i>friend</i>

38:19.848 --> 38:22.620
can get back in tune
with his environment.

38:23.923 --> 38:25.626
How is that?

38:28.519 --> 38:32.909
The first step to changing
the world is changing yourself.

38:34.312 --> 38:36.315
And if I were you,
I'd start with that tie.

38:55.724 --> 38:59.933
So, are you just not talking
to me on purpose or what?

39:09.055 --> 39:11.759
I try and avoid
conversations with people

39:11.794 --> 39:14.932
who can't treat me
as respectfully as I treat them.

39:14.967 --> 39:16.335
Yeah.

39:18.841 --> 39:20.310
Okay.

39:20.344 --> 39:23.316
I guess I-I knew
that talking about the trial

39:23.350 --> 39:26.122
would cause trouble,
and I did it anyway.

39:26.156 --> 39:27.324
And I'm not sure why.

39:27.359 --> 39:28.961
It's just
that everybody was talking

39:28.996 --> 39:31.267
about their families this
and their families that

39:31.301 --> 39:34.106
and their brothers and sisters,
and I-I just couldn't stand it.

39:34.140 --> 39:35.809
Can't blame the other kids

39:35.843 --> 39:38.048
because their life
has been easier.

39:38.082 --> 39:41.021
And every school I send you to
will come with challenges...

39:41.055 --> 39:45.264
challenges you've already
overcome at St. Joseph's.

39:45.298 --> 39:48.938
Like what... what challenges
have I overcome?

39:48.973 --> 39:52.078
Well, the new boy
is always the target.

39:52.112 --> 39:54.149
But I am pretty sure
it'll be a while

39:54.183 --> 39:56.153
before the bullies
at St. Joseph's

39:56.187 --> 39:58.157
feel they can
beat up on you again.

39:58.191 --> 40:00.329
But I-I'm still not sure
that I belong there.

40:00.363 --> 40:03.068
Right now, you'll be a stranger
no matter where you go.

40:03.102 --> 40:05.439
The longer you avoid
sticking in one place,

40:05.473 --> 40:07.075
the harder it'll get.

40:15.562 --> 40:17.363
You make deals
with criminals, right?

40:17.397 --> 40:19.200
Mm-hmm.

40:19.234 --> 40:20.570
Well, how about
making a deal with me?

40:21.973 --> 40:23.108
What kind of deal?

40:25.625 --> 40:28.319
I'll go to St. Joseph's
like you want,

40:28.354 --> 40:30.090
but then as soon as it's time
for me to leave

40:30.124 --> 40:31.492
and go somewhere else,

40:31.526 --> 40:34.165
you have to give me
like 30 days' notice, okay?

40:34.199 --> 40:36.102
Because I <i>can</i> do this.

40:36.136 --> 40:39.343
I can... I can... Go
to catholic school.

40:39.377 --> 40:42.448
I can be civil as long as we
both admit that sooner or later,

40:42.483 --> 40:45.355
I'm gonna have to leave
and start over somewhere else.

40:47.594 --> 40:49.329
That's true.

40:49.363 --> 40:52.169
Whatever happens here, you will
one day go off on your own

40:52.204 --> 40:53.506
and be the new kid again.

40:53.540 --> 40:57.347
But no matter where you go...

40:57.382 --> 40:59.519
No matter when...

40:59.553 --> 41:01.524
You'll never be
a stranger to me.

41:03.596 --> 41:06.334
I will always know you.

41:09.208 --> 41:10.442
Whether I like it or not?

41:10.477 --> 41:12.013
That's right, Buster.

41:13.985 --> 41:16.222
Whether you like it or not.

41:18.060 --> 41:19.629
Deal?

41:23.562 --> 41:25.344
