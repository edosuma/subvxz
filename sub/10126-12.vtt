WEBVTT

00:23.367 --> 00:25.500
WHY ARE ALL
THOSE GUYS TALKING
TO SHAWN'S GIRLFRIEND?

00:25.500 --> 00:27.600
WELL, SHAWN AND JENNIFER
BROKE UP THIS MORNING.

00:27.600 --> 00:29.500
LOOK AT HER. SHE'S
ALREADY ON THE PROWL.

00:29.500 --> 00:31.100
WELL, HOW'S SHAWN
TAKING IT?

00:31.100 --> 00:33.500
ARE YOU KIDDING?
SHAWN IS SHAWN.

00:33.500 --> 00:35.567
YOU CAN'T
KEEP SHAWN DOWN.

00:35.567 --> 00:36.567
GET UP, SHAWN.

00:38.600 --> 00:39.967
SHE DUMPED ME.

00:39.967 --> 00:43.000
SHE DUMPED ME
GOOD...

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
AND I DIDN'T
EVEN SEE IT COMING.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.867
LOOK WHAT THEY DONE
TO MY BOY.

00:48.867 --> 00:51.300
LOOK, SHAWN,
IF IT'S ANY CONSOLATION,

00:51.300 --> 00:54.300
I THINK YOU
CAN DO A LOT BETTER
THAN JENNIFER BASSET.

00:54.300 --> 00:55.500
YOU THINK SO?

00:55.500 --> 00:56.967
UH, WAIT A MINUTE,
TOPANGA.

00:56.967 --> 00:58.200
HAVE YOU LOOKED AT HER?

00:58.200 --> 01:00.066
OK, SO SHE'S PRETTY.
SHE'S TALL.

01:00.066 --> 01:02.100
SHE DRIVES A NEW
RED CONVERTIBLE.

01:02.100 --> 01:04.400
OH, HECK,
I'D GO OUT WITH HER.

01:04.400 --> 01:07.867
I DIDN'T WANT TO
SAY THING WHEN YOU
WERE GOING OUT WITH HER,

01:07.867 --> 01:09.233
BUT IF YOU ASK ME, SHAWN,

01:09.233 --> 01:12.200
JENNIFER BASSET IS ONE
STUCK-UP, CONCEITED GIRL.

01:12.200 --> 01:13.500
DO YOU THINK SO?

01:13.500 --> 01:15.100
OH, YEAH. NOSE
WAY UP IN THE AIR,

01:15.100 --> 01:19.200
AND, FRANKLY,
SHAWN, I'M NOT SO SURE
IT'S HER REAL NOSE.

01:19.200 --> 01:20.233
YOU MEAN?

01:20.233 --> 01:22.967
PLASTIC. JUST LIKE
HER PERSONALITY.

01:22.967 --> 01:25.033
SO YOU'RE REALLY NOT
MISSING OUT ON ANYTHING.

01:25.033 --> 01:28.500
SO GET UP AND BE SHAWN.

01:28.500 --> 01:30.800
YEAH. YEAH,
YOU'RE RIGHT.

01:33.734 --> 01:35.400
YOU KNOW
WHAT I THINK, JEN?

01:35.400 --> 01:36.834
I THINK YOU'RE CONCEITED.

01:36.834 --> 01:38.200
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

01:38.200 --> 01:39.600
CONCEITED AND STUCK-UP

01:39.600 --> 01:41.734
AND SOMETHING
ABOUT YOUR NOSE.

01:41.734 --> 01:43.667
WHAT ABOUT MY NOSE?

01:43.667 --> 01:44.900
UM...

01:44.900 --> 01:46.233

BAD, BAD THINGS, HMM?

01:59.300 --> 02:01.033
LIKE I'D EVER TELL YOU.

02:04.800 --> 02:06.700
CORY MATTHEWS,
SON OF ALAN AND AMY,

02:06.700 --> 02:08.867
GRANDSON OF NANA AND SAM.

02:08.867 --> 02:11.100
HOW COULD YOU
SELL OUT MY NANA?

02:13.000 --> 02:15.133
YOU KNOW,
I'VE BEEN THINKING.

02:15.133 --> 02:18.667
MAYBE THERE STILL COULD
BE SOMETHING BETWEEN US.

02:24.367 --> 02:27.033
I'D BE WILLING TO
GIVE IT ANOTHER TRY.

02:27.033 --> 02:30.200
JUST AS LONG
AS YOU'RE NOT MAD
AT CORY.

02:30.200 --> 02:32.734
NO, SHAWN.
HE'S YOUR BEST FRIEND.

02:32.734 --> 02:35.100
HOW COULD I
EVER COME BETWEEN YOU
AND YOUR BEST FRIEND?

02:35.100 --> 02:36.567
HISS!

02:38.033 --> 02:40.300
DID--DID--
DID YOU SEE THAT?

02:40.300 --> 02:41.467
YEAH, I SAW THAT.

02:41.467 --> 02:42.867
WELL, WHAT DO YOU
THINK IT MEANS?

02:42.867 --> 02:44.600
NOTHING GOOD FOR YOU.

02:53.400 --> 02:55.734
SHAWN, HEY.

02:55.734 --> 02:57.567
LISTEN,
I WAS JUST CURIOUS.

02:57.567 --> 03:00.367
WHAT DOES IT MEAN
WHEN A GIRL GOES...HISS!

03:00.367 --> 03:02.300
CORY, COME ON. SHE
WAS JUST BEING PLAYFUL.

03:02.300 --> 03:05.567
PLAYFUL LIKE A SPIDER
WHEN IT CATCHES A FLY

03:05.567 --> 03:06.567
AND SUCKS OUT
ITS HEAD MEAT?

03:06.567 --> 03:07.867
SHE WAS UPSET, YOU KNOW?

03:07.867 --> 03:09.600
AFTER ALL OF
THOSE TERRIBLE THINGS
YOU SAID ABOUT HER.

03:09.600 --> 03:11.500
SHAWN, I SAID THEM
TO<i>YOU,</i>

03:11.500 --> 03:13.467
TO MAKE MY BEST FRIEND
FEEL BETTER ABOUT
BEING DUMPED.

03:13.467 --> 03:14.834
MAY I SPEAK FREELY?

03:14.834 --> 03:16.000
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S WISE.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.367
WELL, MAYBE
I'M JUST NOT WISE,

03:17.367 --> 03:21.000
BUT I THINK JENNIFER,
OR SHOULD I SAY
ZATHRAK THE UNDEAD,

03:21.000 --> 03:24.200
IS A STUCK-UP,
MANIPULATIVE, COLD-BLOODED--

03:24.200 --> 03:30.567
OH, SHE'S RIGHT BEHIND ME,
ANTICIPATING MY HEAD MEAT,
ISN'T SHE?

03:30.567 --> 03:31.800
HELLO, CORY.

03:31.800 --> 03:33.900
ALL HAIL ZATHRAK.

03:33.900 --> 03:35.033
Jennifer: SHAWN...

03:37.233 --> 03:41.934
YOU AND I HAVE BEEN
WORKING SO HARD TO MAKE
THIS RELATIONSHIP WORK,

03:41.934 --> 03:46.300
BUT THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE
WHO ONLY WANT TO
TEAR US APART,

03:46.300 --> 03:50.767
SO I DON'T THINK WE
SHOULD ALLOW THOSE NEGATIVE
PRESENCES IN OUR LIVES...

03:50.767 --> 03:52.767
DO YOU?

03:52.767 --> 03:57.400
WELL, NOW, JENNIFER,
I'M NOT QUITE SO SURE
I SEE IT THAT WAY.

04:01.400 --> 04:05.100
Shawn: WOW! SUDDENLY
EVERYTHING IS SO CLEAR.

04:05.100 --> 04:06.700
Jennifer: THEN YOU
SEE MY POINT?

04:06.700 --> 04:09.500
YES. YES. YOU'RE
A REALLY GOOD DEBATER.

04:09.500 --> 04:11.600
SO, IF YOU WANT TO
BE MY BOYFRIEND,

04:11.600 --> 04:15.900
THEN I THINK YOU SHOULD
TELL CORY YOU CAN'T
SEE HIM ANYMORE.

04:15.900 --> 04:18.000
BUT WE'VE
BEEN BEST FRIENDS
OUR WHOLE LIVES.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.500
I MEAN, HOW AM I
JUST SUPPOSED TO SAY,

04:19.500 --> 04:21.734
"CORY, YOU'RE OUT
OF MY LIFE"?

04:21.734 --> 04:22.967
OOH, MORE.

Shawn: CORY, COULD YOU
COME HERE FOR A SEC?

04:28.700 --> 04:30.500
OH. MAYBE THIS IS GOOD NEWS.

04:33.934 --> 04:35.400
GET UP, CORY.

04:35.400 --> 04:36.834

04:36.834 --> 04:38.300
HE DUMPED ME GOOD...

04:38.300 --> 04:41.867

"OH, MAYBE THIS
IS GOOD NEWS."
