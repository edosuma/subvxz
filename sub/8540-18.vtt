01:53.069 --> 01:55.680
SHE LOST HER SHOE, SO SHE
COULDN'T HAVE WALKED FAR.

01:55.680 --> 01:58.640

TONIGHT, THEN, BEFORE MY FRIENDS

03:08.362 --> 03:10.581
I-I WAS IN A ROOM.

03:10.581 --> 03:12.496
IT'S COLD.

03:12.496 --> 03:15.238
CAN YOU SEE ANYTHING?

03:17.327 --> 03:19.895
IT'S--IT'S TOO DARK.

03:19.895 --> 03:23.159
WERE YOU SITTING IN A CHAIR
OR WERE YOU LYING DOWN?

03:23.159 --> 03:26.249
LYING DOWN.ON THE FLOOR OR ON THE BED?

03:26.249 --> 03:27.859
ON THE FLOOR.

03:27.859 --> 03:30.122
THERE'S...

03:30.122 --> 03:33.517
DIRT AND STRAW.

03:33.517 --> 03:35.737
[clears throat]

03:35.737 --> 03:39.088
IT MAKES ME COUGH.

03:39.088 --> 03:42.091
WHAT DOES IT SMELL LIKE?HORSES.

03:42.091 --> 03:44.180

YEAH, THAT'S HER SHOE.

04:10.162 --> 04:13.035

[Patrick] ALL RIGHT.

04:26.048 --> 04:28.398

A LIGHT SWITCH RIGHT HERE.

04:28.398 --> 04:29.356

04:33.273 --> 04:35.057
OH.

04:35.057 --> 04:37.015
UH-OH.

04:53.380 --> 04:55.947
THE BULLET CREASED HER SKULL.
IT DIDN'T FRACTURE THE BONE,

04:55.947 --> 04:58.863
BUT A HIT LIKE THAT CAN KNOCK
YOU AROUND SOMETHING WICKED.

04:58.863 --> 05:00.865
SHE COULD HAVE BEEN UNCONSCIOUS
FOR A WHILE.

05:00.865 --> 05:02.911
SHOOTER PROBABLY THOUGHT
SHE WAS DEAD

05:02.911 --> 05:06.088
AND DUMPED HER
WITH THE OTHER BODIES.WHAT ABOUT THE AMNESIA?

05:06.088 --> 05:08.090
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO TELL YOU.

05:08.090 --> 05:10.092
RETROGRADE AMNESIA
USUALLY RECEDES WITH TIME,

05:10.092 --> 05:12.137
BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW FAST
THAT'LL HAPPEN.

05:12.137 --> 05:15.227
OKAY, WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS
JUST FOCUS ON THE QUEEN.

05:15.227 --> 05:18.274
HERE'S THE LADY.
NOW YOU SAW WHERE SHE IS.

05:18.274 --> 05:20.668
THERE'S THE LADY.

05:20.668 --> 05:21.930
OKAY. NOW TELL ME...

05:23.888 --> 05:25.673
WHERE'S THE QUEEN?

05:25.673 --> 05:28.110
WRONG.
FIRST BOY YOU EVER KISSED.

05:28.110 --> 05:30.547
I DON'T KNOW.

05:30.547 --> 05:33.637
WHAT'S YOUR FIRST NAME?I DON'T KNOW. I'M SORRY.

05:33.637 --> 05:35.770
LOOK, THERE SHE WAS.
SHE WAS ALWAYS THERE.

05:35.770 --> 05:38.381
RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE.AND THE POINT BEING?

05:38.381 --> 05:40.427
OH, I'M JUST MAKING SURE
SHE HAS AMNESIA,

05:40.427 --> 05:42.472
WHICH, BY THE WAY, YOU DO.

05:42.472 --> 05:45.519
IT'S HARD TO LIE WHEN YOU'RE
THINKING ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE.

05:45.519 --> 05:49.871
[whispers] GREAT.WE'RE CHECKING
OUR MISSING PERSONS DATABASE,

05:49.871 --> 05:52.700
THEN WE'LL RUN YOUR PRINTS.
SOMETHING'LL PROBABLY COME UP.[cell phone rings]

05:52.700 --> 05:55.920
FIND SOMEBODY TO COME IN
AND PRINT HER.OKAY.

05:55.920 --> 05:58.836
AGENT HIGHTOWER.MORNING, LISBON.
AS SOON AS IT'S PRACTICAL,

05:58.836 --> 06:01.404
I WANT TO SEE YOU, VAN PELT
AND RIGSBY IN MY OFFICE.

06:01.404 --> 06:04.233
I'VE BEEN MEANING TO ADDRESS
THIS ISSUE FOR A WHILE,

06:04.233 --> 06:06.453
BUT THERE'S BEEN SO MUCH
COMING ACROSS MY DESK,

06:06.453 --> 06:08.890
I HAVEN'T HAD THE TIME.

06:08.890 --> 06:11.936
FIRST OFF,
NEITHER OF YOU IS DENYING

06:11.936 --> 06:14.069
YOU'RE IN
A SEXUAL RELATIONSHIP?

06:14.069 --> 06:16.332
ARE YOU?NO.

06:16.332 --> 06:18.856
NO, MA'AM.YOU WORK TOGETHER,
YOU DEVELOP FEELINGS.

06:18.856 --> 06:20.554
NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT.

06:20.554 --> 06:22.730
BUT YOU KNOW VERY WELL
IT'S AGAINST CBI RULES,

06:22.730 --> 06:24.862
AND LIKE I TELL MY KIDS,
RULES ARE RULES.

06:24.862 --> 06:28.431
IF YOU WANT TO STAY TOGETHER,
THAT'S YOUR CHOICE.

06:28.431 --> 06:30.955
BUT ONE OF YOU HAS TO TRANSFER
OUT OF THE UNIT.

06:30.955 --> 06:33.567
IF YOU BOTH WANT
TO STAY IN THE UNIT,

06:33.567 --> 06:35.569
THEN YOU CAN'T BE TOGETHER.

06:35.569 --> 06:37.222
THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

06:37.222 --> 06:39.747
GIVE ME YOUR DECISION
TOMORROW AT THE LATEST.

06:43.490 --> 06:44.882
QUESTIONS?

06:44.882 --> 06:46.493
NO, MA'AM.NO.

06:46.493 --> 06:47.537
OKAY.

06:50.932 --> 06:53.848
LISBON, STAY A MOMENT.

06:53.848 --> 06:56.894
WHY DIDN'T YOU HANDLE
THIS SITUATION YOURSELF?

06:56.894 --> 06:58.983
I WON'T DEFEND
WHAT I DID, MA'AM--

06:58.983 --> 07:00.985
I UNDERSTAND THESE TWO
SNEAKING AROUND,

07:00.985 --> 07:02.770
BUT YOU'RE THEIR SUPERIOR.

07:02.770 --> 07:05.686
I EXPECT MORE.

07:05.686 --> 07:07.209
[sighs]

07:07.209 --> 07:09.994
I'LL BE WRITING
A CORRECTIVE MEMO.

07:09.994 --> 07:11.474
THAT'S IT.

07:11.474 --> 07:13.389
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

07:21.441 --> 07:23.443
I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT.

07:24.879 --> 07:28.404
CHO, WHERE ARE WE
WITH THE VICTIMS?

07:28.404 --> 07:31.189
I VERIFIED THE TWO I.D.s
WE FOUND AT THE SCENE.

07:31.189 --> 07:33.017
JANINE AND MITCHELL LANGHAM
FROM CHICO,

07:33.017 --> 07:36.151
BOTH IN THEIR 50s,
NO FAMILY IN STATE.

07:36.151 --> 07:39.154
NEIGHBOR SAID THAT THEY WERE
HIKING IN KASTEN STATE FOREST.THAT'S 100 MILES
FROM WHERE WE FOUND THEM.

07:39.154 --> 07:42.462
WELL, WHAT ABOUT
THE THIRD VICTIM?SAME AS THE JANE DOE.
NO I.D. OF ANY KIND.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.942
THE CORONER SAYS
HE'S IN HIS EARLY 20s.

07:44.942 --> 07:49.164
I PUT HIS PRINTS
INTO THE SYSTEM.VAN PELT, DID YOU GET
ANY HITS ON THEM? VAN PELT?

07:49.164 --> 07:52.428
UH, I'LL CHECK. I'LL CHECK.THE CORONER THINKS
THAT THEY WERE SHOT

07:52.428 --> 07:54.822
WITH A HIGH-POWERED RIFLE--
THE LANGHAMS UP CLOSE,

07:54.822 --> 07:56.606
OUR JANE DOE
AND THE UNIDENTIFIED MALE

07:56.606 --> 07:59.696
FROM A DISTANCE.DO EITHER OF THE LANGHAMS
HAVE A RECORD?

07:59.696 --> 08:02.786
NO.I THINK WE CAN SET
THE LANGHAMS ASIDE.

08:02.786 --> 08:05.528
I THINK THEY WERE BY-PRODUCTS.
WEREN'T PLANNED.OH?

08:05.528 --> 08:07.878
YEAH. THE FIRST TWO VICTIMS
WERE SHOT FROM A DISTANCE,

08:07.878 --> 08:09.532
I.D.s WERE TAKEN.

08:09.532 --> 08:12.666
TWO VICTIMS WERE SHOT UP-CLOSE.
I.D.s WERE NOT TAKEN.

08:12.666 --> 08:15.756
CLEARLY, THE FIRST TWO VICTIMS
WERE THE TARGETS.AND WHEN THE LANGHAMS
ROLL UP TO THE SCENE,

08:15.756 --> 08:17.584
WRONG PLACE, WRONG TIME.

08:17.584 --> 08:20.108
KILLER SHOOTS THE LANGHAMS,
FREAKS OUT.

08:20.108 --> 08:22.110
DOESN'T BOTHER
TO TAKE THEIR I.D.s.

08:22.110 --> 08:23.938
DOESN'T EVEN NOTICE

08:23.938 --> 08:26.897
THAT ONE OF THE FIRST VICTIMS
THAT HE SHOT WAS ONLY WOUNDED.

08:26.897 --> 08:28.986
WE GOT A HIT
ON THE MALE VICTIM'S PRINTS.

08:28.986 --> 08:30.640
HIS NAME'S LEONARD RAILTON,

08:30.640 --> 08:33.338
NATIVE AMERICAN, LIVED ON
THE STORM RIVER RESERVATION.

08:33.338 --> 08:35.297
THAT'S RIGHT NEXT
TO THE STATE FOREST.

08:35.297 --> 08:37.386
OH, HE'S BEEN IN AND OUT
OF THE SYSTEM

08:37.386 --> 08:39.519
SINCE HIS EARLY TEENS--
MOSTLY SMALL STUFF,

08:39.519 --> 08:41.259
A COUPLE OF DRUG BUSTS.

08:41.259 --> 08:43.697
NO FAMILY LISTED. HIS EMERGENCY
CONTACT IS HIS PAROLE OFFICER.

08:43.697 --> 08:45.786
GO AND GO SHOW JANE DOE
A PICTURE OF LEONARD

08:45.786 --> 08:48.963
AND THE LANGHAMS.
IT'S WORTH A SHOT.OKAY.

08:48.963 --> 08:52.575
YOU GUYS CHECK OUT THE TRAIL
THAT THE LANGHAMS WERE HIKING.

08:52.575 --> 08:55.491
IT SOUNDS LIKE
SOMETHING'S GOING ON UP THERE.

08:55.491 --> 08:57.798
LET'S GO TALK
TO RAILTON'S P.O.[lowered voice] HEY.

08:57.798 --> 09:00.496
THERE'S NO POINT IN HIDING
YOUR FRUSTRATION WITH HIGHTOWER.

09:00.496 --> 09:02.542
I MEAN, SOONER OR LATER,

09:02.542 --> 09:04.761
YOU'RE JUST GONNA EXPLODE
WITH SUPPRESSED RAGE.

09:04.761 --> 09:07.068
WITH ANY LUCK,
YOU'LL BE NEXT TO ME.

09:07.068 --> 09:09.723
WELL, THAT'S WHAT
I'M WORRIED ABOUT.

09:09.723 --> 09:11.246
GRACE.

09:11.246 --> 09:12.682
YOU OKAY?

09:12.682 --> 09:14.423
SURE. [sighs]

09:14.423 --> 09:15.729
NO. YOU?

09:15.729 --> 09:18.209
THIS IS A GOOD THING, OKAY?

09:18.209 --> 09:21.822
NO MORE SNEAKING AROUND. WE GET
TO DECIDE WHAT WE WANNA DO.DO WE KNOW WHAT THAT IS?

09:21.822 --> 09:24.433
LET'S JUST GET THROUGH THE DAY,
AND THEN TONIGHT,

09:24.433 --> 09:28.480
WE'LL OPEN UP A BOTTLE OF WINE
AND WE'LL TALK, OKAY?YEAH. SOUNDS GOOD.

09:28.480 --> 09:30.961
[whispers] I LOVE YOU.[whispers] I LOVE YOU.

09:33.181 --> 09:37.185
[woman] I THOUGHT LEONARD
HAD A CHANCE, YOU KNOW?

09:37.185 --> 09:40.841
GOOD KID. REALLY TRYING
NOT TO REPEAT OLD MISTAKES.

09:40.841 --> 09:43.713
HOW LONG WERE YOU LEONARD'S
PAROLE OFFICER, MS. BRINTON?

09:43.713 --> 09:45.889
A LITTLE OVER A YEAR.

09:45.889 --> 09:48.805
HE HAVE ANY FAMILY
WE SHOULD SPEAK TO?

09:48.805 --> 09:50.851
NO, LEONARD DIDN'T HAVE
ANYBODY.

09:50.851 --> 09:53.854
BUT HIS MOTHER WAS SHOSHONE,
GREW UP ON THE RESERVATION.

09:53.854 --> 09:56.726
THAT'S WHY I GOT HIM TO MOVE
THERE AFTER HE WAS RELEASED.WHY THE RESERVATION?

09:56.726 --> 09:59.729
LEONARD NEEDED PEOPLE
IN HIS LIFE WHO CARED ABOUT HIM.

09:59.729 --> 10:02.384
HE COULD GET THAT THERE.
IT'S A SMALL COMMUNITY--

10:02.384 --> 10:05.474
NOT TOO WELL-OFF, BUT TIGHT.DO YOU LIVE THERE?

10:05.474 --> 10:07.476
MM-HMM. MY FATHER'S CLAN IS
FROM THERE. I'M SHOSHONE.

10:07.476 --> 10:09.086
SHOSHONE, UH,

10:09.086 --> 10:11.785
WITH A NEW YORK ITALIAN/IRISH
THING GOING ON,

10:11.785 --> 10:14.178
IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN
BY THE ACCENT.

10:14.178 --> 10:16.180
IS THAT
FROM YOUR MOTHER'S SIDE?

10:16.180 --> 10:18.792
I'M NOT THE FIRST PERSON
WHO NEEDED TIME

10:18.792 --> 10:20.750
TO FIGURE OUT WHO SHE WAS.MM.

10:20.750 --> 10:22.665
WERE THERE ANY INDICATIONS

10:22.665 --> 10:24.667
THAT LEONARD WAS DOING
ANYTHING ILLEGAL?

10:24.667 --> 10:27.844
NO. HE HAD SOME PROBLEMS
WHEN HE FIRST GOT THERE,

10:27.844 --> 10:30.847
BUT ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO,
HE SETTLED DOWN, GOT A JOB,

10:30.847 --> 10:34.721
HAD A GIRLFRIEND
IN THE VALLEY.WHAT WAS HER NAME?

10:34.721 --> 10:37.071
DERRIEN HOPWOOD.
I MET HER A COUPLE OF TIMES.

10:37.071 --> 10:38.681
NO RECORD.

10:38.681 --> 10:40.596
GOOD INFLUENCE,
I THOUGHT.

10:40.596 --> 10:41.815
IS THIS HER?

10:43.773 --> 10:46.776
UH... NO,
I DON'T KNOW THIS WOMAN.

10:46.776 --> 10:48.952
POSITIVE?I SAID NO.

10:48.952 --> 10:50.345
I GOT IT.

10:52.086 --> 10:54.828
DOES LEONARD HAVE ANY FRIENDS
ON THE RESERVATION

10:54.828 --> 10:56.830
WE SHOULD TALK TO?YOU'RE GOING ON THE REZ?

10:56.830 --> 11:00.703
YEAH.WILL THE TRIBAL POLICE BE
WITH YOU?

11:00.703 --> 11:02.531
OH, THEY'RE AWARE
OF THE INVESTIGATION.

11:02.531 --> 11:06.361
WE'LL KEEP THEM IN THE LOOP.I SHOULD GO WITH YOU.

11:06.361 --> 11:07.754
OH, THAT'S NOT NECESSARY.

11:07.754 --> 11:10.321
AS FAR AS SOME OF THEM
ARE CONCERNED,

11:10.321 --> 11:12.323
YOU'RE FOREIGNERS--
FOREIGNERS WITH BADGES.

11:12.323 --> 11:13.673
YOU WON'T GET ANYTHING.

11:13.673 --> 11:15.762
I'LL GET MY COAT.

11:15.762 --> 11:19.287
EXCELLENT. WELL,
WE GOT OURSELVES A NATIVE GUIDE.

11:19.287 --> 11:21.506

11:21.506 --> 11:23.813
[Rigsby]
JANINE AND MITCHELL LANGHAM.

11:23.813 --> 11:26.555
RING ANY BELLS?[sighs] NO,
BUT I DON'T REALLY MEET PEOPLE

11:26.555 --> 11:29.558
UNLESS THEY'RE IN TROUBLE.WELL, THESE PEOPLE GOT
INTO TROUBLE.

11:29.558 --> 11:31.995

11:31.995 --> 11:34.955
ROBBERIES, ASSAULTS?NO, JUST, YOU KNOW, RACCOONS,
BIRDS, DEER, RATTLESNAKES, BEAR.

11:34.955 --> 11:37.871
WELL, I DON'T THINK
A BEAR SHOT FOUR PEOPLE

11:37.871 --> 11:39.916
WITH A HIGH-POWERED RIFLE.NO, BEARS CAN'T DO THAT.

11:39.916 --> 11:42.136
THEIR NEIGHBOR SAID
THE LANGHAMS WOULD'VE WALKED

11:42.136 --> 11:45.139
THE MORNINGSTAR TRAIL.HUH. MORNINGSTAR IS NOT
ONE OF OUR MORE POPULAR TRAILS.

11:45.139 --> 11:48.316

WE HAVE
AN ANIMAL CONTROL ISSUE.

11:52.929 --> 11:55.932
WELL, WE NEED TO CHECK OUT
THAT TRAIL.[sighs] OKAY, UH...

11:55.932 --> 11:58.108
OKAY, THE TRAILHEAD
IS RIGHT OVER THERE.

11:58.108 --> 12:00.154
YOU JUST STAY ON THE PATH.

12:00.154 --> 12:03.113
WHEN YOU GET TO THE FORK,
YOU GO TO THE LEFT, OKAY?

12:03.113 --> 12:05.637
JUST STAY TO THE LEFT.
YOU'LL BE FINE.

12:05.637 --> 12:07.117
GOT IT. LEFT. THANKS.

12:07.117 --> 12:09.641
[woman] I DON'T RECOGNIZE
ANY OF THEM.

12:11.121 --> 12:13.950
TAKE YOUR TIME.
THINK ABOUT IT.

12:13.950 --> 12:17.258
I HAVE. THESE PEOPLE ARE
ALL DEAD, RIGHT?

12:17.258 --> 12:18.738
YES.

12:18.738 --> 12:21.044
THERE'S ONE PIECE
OF GOOD NEWS.

12:21.044 --> 12:23.612
WE RAN YOU THROUGH
THE FINGERPRINTS DATABASE.

12:23.612 --> 12:25.092
YOU'RE NOT THERE.

12:25.092 --> 12:27.311
HOW IS THAT GOOD NEWS?

12:27.311 --> 12:29.313
IT MEANS
YOU'RE NOT A CRIMINAL...

12:29.313 --> 12:32.142
ORYOU'RE
A VERY, VERY GOOD ONE.

12:32.142 --> 12:33.753
[chuckles]

12:37.887 --> 12:41.543
HOW'S IT GOING
WITH THE, UM...

12:41.543 --> 12:44.720
MISSING PERSONS THING?

12:44.720 --> 12:47.201
WELL, NO ONE'S FILED
A MISSING PERSONS REPORT

12:47.201 --> 12:48.724
FITTING YOUR DESCRIPTION
YET,

12:48.724 --> 12:51.771
BUT I'M SURE
IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME.

12:51.771 --> 12:53.773
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

12:53.773 --> 12:56.732
LOOK, YOU HAD A JOB TO DO,
AND YOU DID IT. THANKS.

12:56.732 --> 12:58.821
YOU DON'T HAVE TO STAY.

12:58.821 --> 13:00.736
I'LL STICK AROUND.

13:03.086 --> 13:06.089
[voice breaking] OKAY.

13:06.089 --> 13:08.048
THANKS.

13:08.048 --> 13:10.311
I'VE GOT A LOT OF TIME
INVESTED HERE,

13:10.311 --> 13:13.270
BUT IF SHE LEAVES, WE'RE INTO
THIS WHOLE SEXISM THING

13:13.270 --> 13:15.316
OF WHOSE JOB IS
MORE IMPORTANT.

13:15.316 --> 13:17.753
LIKE I SAID,
IT'S COMPLICATED.NO, IT ISN'T.

13:17.753 --> 13:20.800
WHAT?WHICH DO YOU WANT MORE--
YOUR JOB OR VAN PELT?

13:20.800 --> 13:23.541
WHAT? IT--IT'S NOT THAT EASY.SURE IT IS.
THIS IS THE FORK, RIGHT?

13:23.541 --> 13:27.067
NO, WE--WE TOOK THE FORK.NO, I DON'T THINK
THAT WAS THE FORK.

13:27.067 --> 13:30.026
I THINK THIS IS THE FORK.WELL, WHATEVER. GO LEFT.

13:30.026 --> 13:31.680
IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.

13:31.680 --> 13:34.204
JOB OR VAN PELT.
ALL THERE IS TO IT.

13:45.476 --> 13:47.827
[Brinton] THE REC CENTER'S
THE COMMUNITY GATHERING SPOT.

13:47.827 --> 13:49.741
LEONARD USED TO COME HERE.

13:53.833 --> 13:55.486
THIS IS JOSEPH SILVERWING.

13:55.486 --> 13:58.098
HE HELPED
TO SETTLE LEONARD IN HERE.

13:58.098 --> 14:00.361
HE'S ON THE TRIBAL COUNCIL.

14:00.361 --> 14:02.842
JOSEPH, THESE ARE THE DETECTIVES
FROM CBI I CALLED YOU ABOUT.TERESA LISBON. HI.

14:02.842 --> 14:04.539
PATRICK JANE.

14:04.539 --> 14:06.933
WE'RE INVESTIGATING THE MURDER
OF LEONARD RAILTON.

14:06.933 --> 14:08.935
CAN YOU TELL US ANYTHING
ABOUT HIM?

14:08.935 --> 14:12.068
HE'S A GOOD KID. WORKED HARD.
STAYED OUT OF TROUBLE.

14:12.068 --> 14:14.723
WE HEARD HE HAD A JOB.

14:14.723 --> 14:16.986
DOWN AT, UH,
MARKHAM WILLIS'S PLACE.

14:16.986 --> 14:19.075
IT'S A SOUVENIR SHOP
JUST OFF THE RESERVATION.

14:19.075 --> 14:21.077
WAS LEONARD HAVING
ANY PROBLEMS?

14:21.077 --> 14:22.818
NO.

14:22.818 --> 14:25.734
DID YOU HEAR ABOUT
ANY ARGUMENTS OR FIGHTS?

14:25.734 --> 14:27.127
NO.

14:27.127 --> 14:29.216
MONEY PROBLEMS?
HEALTH ISSUES?

14:29.216 --> 14:30.913
NO.

14:30.913 --> 14:33.742
YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU REALLY ARE
OPENING THINGS UP HERE.

14:33.742 --> 14:35.744
DO YOU KNOW ABOUT
ANY RELATIONSHIPS

14:35.744 --> 14:38.355
HE WAS HAVING
OFF THE RESERVATION MAYBE?NO.

14:38.355 --> 14:41.793
[indistinct conversations]

14:45.797 --> 14:47.321
NICE SHOT.

14:49.192 --> 14:51.760
DID YOU GUYS KNOW
LEONARD RAILTON?

14:51.760 --> 14:53.936
[tap, balls clatter]

14:53.936 --> 14:56.069
I'LL TAKE THAT AS A YES.

14:56.069 --> 14:58.723
I'M TRYING TO FIND
THE PERSON WHO KILLED HIM.

14:58.723 --> 15:01.683
DO YOU WANT TO HELP ME
WITH THAT?

15:01.683 --> 15:03.946
DON'T ALL SPEAK AT ONCE.

15:03.946 --> 15:05.817
WHO'S GONNA TALK FIRST?

15:05.817 --> 15:07.907
[chuckles]
WE DON'T TALK TO PO-PO.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.996
PO-PO?

15:09.996 --> 15:11.649
I LIKE THAT.

15:11.649 --> 15:15.262
BUT I'M NOT PO-PO.
I'M A PO-PO CONSULTANT.

15:15.262 --> 15:17.699
HOW ABOUT THIS?

15:17.699 --> 15:22.008
I BET THAT I CAN SINK A BALL
BEFORE YOUR BEST PLAYER CAN,

15:22.008 --> 15:25.707
AND HE CAN HAVE
THREE CHANCES TO MY ONE,

15:25.707 --> 15:30.364
AND IF I LOSE...
50 BUCKS. HUH?

15:30.364 --> 15:34.150
BUT IF I WIN,
YOU TELL ME ABOUT LEONARD.

15:34.150 --> 15:36.457
WE GOT A DEAL?

15:36.457 --> 15:38.285
GREAT.
WHO'S YOUR SHARPSHOOTER?

15:38.285 --> 15:40.940
IT'S YOU, ISN'T IT, SHORTY?
LET'S DO THIS.

15:40.940 --> 15:42.593
OKAY.

15:42.593 --> 15:44.552
ALL RIGHT.
FIRST BALL IN WINS.

15:44.552 --> 15:45.988
[balls clatter]

15:45.988 --> 15:48.338
YOU GET THREE CHANCES.
I GET ONE.

15:48.338 --> 15:49.992
OKAY.

15:49.992 --> 15:52.255
AND BY THE WAY,
THAT GIRL YOU'RE CRUSHING ON,

15:52.255 --> 15:55.128
THE ONE IN THE BLUE SWEATER--
IT'S NEVER GONNA HAPPEN.

15:55.128 --> 15:57.826
SHE'S INTO THE TALL GUY.
GOOD LUCK.

15:57.826 --> 15:59.741
MY MONEY'S ON THE KID.

16:02.657 --> 16:04.964
[Patrick] ONE.

16:06.704 --> 16:09.272
TWO.

16:09.272 --> 16:12.710
LAST TIME. GOOD LUCK.
LUCKY LAST.

16:12.710 --> 16:14.930
THAT'S THREE.

16:14.930 --> 16:18.107
THERE'S A HOLE
IN THAT BALL.[ball clatters]

16:18.107 --> 16:20.370
HERE'S THE HARD PART.

16:20.370 --> 16:22.068
[groans]

16:27.073 --> 16:29.292
[Patrick groans]

16:30.990 --> 16:33.209
OOH! SCHOOLED YA.

16:35.472 --> 16:37.735
OKAY, SO, UH,
WHAT WAS LEONARD'S STORY?

16:37.735 --> 16:41.696
HE HAD MONEY.
A LOT OF IT.

16:41.696 --> 16:43.654
ALWAYS HAD
THE NEWEST KICKS.

16:43.654 --> 16:45.743
SINCE WHEN?

16:45.743 --> 16:47.093
LIKE, SIX MONTHS AGO.

16:47.093 --> 16:49.747
WELL, I HEARD
HE HAD A JOB.

16:49.747 --> 16:52.707
[scoffs] OH, YEAH.
AT WILLIS'S SOUVENIR SHOP?

16:52.707 --> 16:55.057
THAT'S PENNIES.

16:55.057 --> 16:56.667
LEONARD HAD MONEY.

16:56.667 --> 16:59.888
ANY IDEA WHERE THAT
MIGHT HAVE COME FROM?

16:59.888 --> 17:01.542
HE WOULDN'T SAY.

17:01.542 --> 17:04.501
BUT HE WAS OUT IN THE WOODS
ALL THE TIME,

17:04.501 --> 17:06.068
SO... WE FIGURED,
YOU KNOW?

17:06.068 --> 17:07.765
YES?

17:07.765 --> 17:10.029
[chuckles] EVERYBODY KNOWS
WHAT GOES ON IN THE WOODS.

17:10.029 --> 17:12.031
[chuckles] OH, SURE.
THE WOODS.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.989
YEAH,
THIS IS NOT THE TRAIL.

17:13.989 --> 17:15.643
IT'S OVER HERE.

17:15.643 --> 17:18.515
ARE YOU SURE? I THOUGHT
I SAW IT OVER HERE.

17:20.082 --> 17:22.606
WATER TANK?

17:24.869 --> 17:26.958
[Rigsby] CHO?

17:26.958 --> 17:28.960
YEAH?

17:28.960 --> 17:32.181
THERE'S A POT PLANT HERE.

17:32.181 --> 17:34.705
ACTUALLY, THERE'S A WHOLE BUNCH
OF POT PLANTS HERE.

17:34.705 --> 17:37.360
IT LOOKS LIKE A FARM.OH, YEAH,

17:37.360 --> 17:39.754
WHICH MEANS THERE'S PROBABLY
SOME BAD GUYS WITH GUNS.

17:39.754 --> 17:43.584
[gunshots]

17:43.584 --> 17:45.368
[pants]

17:45.368 --> 17:48.023
[pants] NO BARS.
SO MUCH FOR BACKUP.

17:50.330 --> 17:52.767
[gunshots]

17:52.767 --> 17:54.986
[panting]THERE'S ONLY ONE SHOOTER.
YOU DRAW FIRE,

17:54.986 --> 17:57.641
AND I'LL TAKE HIM FROM THE SIDE.
READY? ONE... TWO...ONE... TWO...

17:57.641 --> 17:59.208
THREE!GO.

18:15.006 --> 18:16.399
RIGSBY! CLEAR!

18:16.399 --> 18:18.923
GOT IT!

18:18.923 --> 18:22.927
[both panting]

18:28.890 --> 18:32.894
IT'S THE KIND OF FARM YOU FIND
ALL OVER PUBLIC LANDS--

18:32.894 --> 18:36.202
ABOUT AN ACRE OF PLANTS,
IRRIGATION PIPES EVERYWHERE.[Cho] MUST BE TAPPING
INTO WATER FROM UP THE VALLEY.

18:36.202 --> 18:38.856
DID YOU HIT THE SHOOTER?
MAYBE HE'S IN A HOSPITAL.DIDN'T SEE ANY BLOOD.
I DOUBT IT.

18:38.856 --> 18:41.511
DO YOU THINK THE RANGER
KNOWINGLY DIRECTED YOU

18:41.511 --> 18:44.471
TOWARD THE POT FARM?
WAS THIS A SETUP?IT'S HARD TO SAY.
WE GOT PRETTY TURNED AROUND.

18:44.471 --> 18:47.648
I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE
WE WERE ON THE TRAIL.WHERE'S THE RANGER NOW?

18:47.648 --> 18:50.999
UP IN THE MOUNTAINS. SUPERVISOR
SAYS HE'S OUT OF CALLING RANGE.FIND OUT WHEN HE'S BACK.

18:50.999 --> 18:53.871
SO IT LOOKS LIKE LEONARD RAILTON
WAS WORKING FOR THE POT FARMERS.

18:53.871 --> 18:58.049
THERE'S A HUNDRED WAYS
THAT COULD TURN UGLY.MEH. IF LEONARD WAS FARMIN'
THE WEED,

18:58.049 --> 19:00.922
HE WOULD'VE TOLD HIS FRIENDS
ABOUT IT.

19:00.922 --> 19:04.143
WHATEVER HE WAS DOING,
HE FELT SHAME OR AMBIVALENCE.

19:04.143 --> 19:06.101
WHICH TAKES
THE INVESTIGATION WHERE?

19:06.101 --> 19:09.452
WELL, WE HAVEN'T SPOKEN
TO THE GIRLFRIEND YET.

19:09.452 --> 19:11.802
SO GO DO THAT.
YOU TWO TALK TO NARCOTICS.

19:11.802 --> 19:15.197
SEE IF THERE'S A LINE ON
MARIJUANA PLAYERS IN THAT AREA.

19:15.197 --> 19:18.418
YOU HEARD WHAT SHE SAID.

19:18.418 --> 19:21.725
WE WEREN'T LIVING TOGETHER
OR ANYTHING, JUST HANGING OUT.

19:21.725 --> 19:24.641
SO LEONARD ISN'T
THE BABY'S FATHER, MS. HOPWOOD?

19:24.641 --> 19:26.861
KAI'S FATHER?
[laughs] NO.

19:26.861 --> 19:28.036
[Kai fusses]

19:28.036 --> 19:30.430
OH, YEAH. I KNOW, HONEY.

19:30.430 --> 19:32.954
BUT LEONARD LIKED
YOUR LITTLE BOY, DIDN'T HE?

19:32.954 --> 19:35.739
SURE. [chuckles]

19:35.739 --> 19:38.916
LEONARD BOUGHT
MOST OF THE TOYS HERE.AND THIS, UH...

19:38.916 --> 19:42.268
ENORMOUS STACK
OF INFANT FORMULA.

19:42.268 --> 19:44.879
YEAH, LIKE,
1,000 BUCKS WORTH.

19:44.879 --> 19:46.228
[Kai fusses]

19:46.228 --> 19:48.230
WHAT'S THE STORY
WITH THAT?

19:48.230 --> 19:51.015
WELL, IT'S BECAUSE KAI GOT
THIS RASH.

19:51.015 --> 19:54.323
IT WAS GOING AROUND, YOU KNOW?
A COUPLE OF KIDS HAD IT.

19:54.323 --> 19:56.847
HE HAD THIS IDEA
IT WAS THE POWDERED FORMULA.

19:56.847 --> 19:59.285
HE MADE ME THROW
ALL THE POWDERED OUT,

19:59.285 --> 20:02.244
WHICH IS CRAZY,
'CAUSE IT'S CHEAPER,

20:02.244 --> 20:04.507
AND IT'S REAL EASY TO USE.

20:04.507 --> 20:07.467
ALL YOU DO IS ADD WATER.
[chuckles]

20:07.467 --> 20:10.600
HOW'S THE RASH NOW?

20:10.600 --> 20:12.254
[fusses]ALL GONE.

20:12.254 --> 20:14.038
[chuckles]

20:14.038 --> 20:16.911
I GUESS HE WAS RIGHT.

20:16.911 --> 20:19.609
YOU WEREN'T SURPRISED TO HEAR
ABOUT LEONARD, WERE YOU?

20:19.609 --> 20:21.655
I MEAN,
YOU--YOU CARED FOR HIM,

20:21.655 --> 20:24.614
BUT YOU WEREN'T STARTLED
TO LEARN THAT HE WAS DEAD.

20:24.614 --> 20:27.704
HE HAD MONEY,

20:27.704 --> 20:30.664
AND NOT FROM
THAT LAME SOUVENIR STORE JOB.

20:30.664 --> 20:33.884
HE WOULDN'T TELL ME
WHERE HE WAS GETTIN' IT.

20:33.884 --> 20:36.844
MY EXPERIENCE IS,
THAT MEANS TROUBLE.

20:36.844 --> 20:39.890
YOUR BEST GUESS?

20:39.890 --> 20:42.023
WHATEVER ELSE
HE WAS DOING...

20:42.023 --> 20:43.677
[Kai fussing]

20:43.677 --> 20:46.897
HE--HE WAS ALWAYS GOOD
TO ME AND KAI.

20:46.897 --> 20:51.162
HE WAS A GOOD MAN.
YOU FIND WHO DID THIS.

20:51.162 --> 20:53.164
WE'LL DO EVERYTHING WE CAN.

20:53.164 --> 20:54.688
[makes popping sound]

20:54.688 --> 20:56.516
[gasping]

20:56.516 --> 20:58.082
[imitates baby gurgling]

21:02.130 --> 21:05.089
[Lisbon] MR. WILLIS, HOW LONG
WAS LEONARD WORKING HERE?[packages rustle]

21:05.089 --> 21:08.658
UH...
I GUESS ABOUT SIX MONTHS.

21:08.658 --> 21:11.966
I HIRED HIM ON DOLORES BRINTON'S
RECOMMENDATION.

21:11.966 --> 21:14.316
HE WAS A GREAT KID,
GOOD WORKER.

21:14.316 --> 21:17.276
OH, YEAH.
THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING 'BOUT.

21:17.276 --> 21:18.886
PRETTY GREAT, HUH?

21:18.886 --> 21:20.496
THIS IS FANTASTIC.

21:20.496 --> 21:22.150
D-DO YOU DELIVER?

21:22.150 --> 21:24.848
AS A MATTER OF FACT, WE DO.ALL RIGHT.

21:24.848 --> 21:27.808
JANE, PUT IT BACK.WHAT?

21:27.808 --> 21:29.897
YOU HEARD ME. NOW.OKAY.

21:29.897 --> 21:31.290
NOW!

21:31.290 --> 21:33.030
ALL RIGHT.

21:33.030 --> 21:34.728
WE THINK THAT, UH,

21:34.728 --> 21:37.687
LEONARD WAS GETTING MONEY
FROM SOMEPLACE ELSE.

21:37.687 --> 21:40.864
ANY IDEA WHAT THAT WAS ABOUT?NO. HE NEVER SAID A WORD
ABOUT IT. WHAT WAS HE DOING?

21:40.864 --> 21:42.779
WE'RE STILL WORKING
ON THAT.

21:42.779 --> 21:45.173
I CAN GIVE YOU A DEAL
ON THAT BONNET.

21:45.173 --> 21:47.393
SPECIAL
LAW ENFORCEMENT DISCOUNT.

21:47.393 --> 21:49.003
[chuckles]
YOU'RE NOT SELF-CONSCIOUS

21:49.003 --> 21:51.092
ABOUT PEDDLING
YOUR OWN CULTURE, ARE YOU?

21:51.092 --> 21:53.703
[chuckles]
THIS IS NOT MY CULTURE.

21:53.703 --> 21:56.010
THIS WAR BONNET IS
FROM THE LAGUNA PEOPLE.

21:56.010 --> 21:57.490
MM.

21:57.490 --> 21:59.840
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH US SHOSHONE.

21:59.840 --> 22:03.060
IT'S KIND OF A PASTICHE,
REALLY.

22:03.060 --> 22:05.585
BUT THAT'S WHAT
YOU AMERICANS WANT TO BUY,

22:05.585 --> 22:08.849
SO THAT'S WHAT I SELL.THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME,
MR. WILLIS. JANE?

22:10.807 --> 22:12.156
JANE!

22:12.156 --> 22:14.768
I'LL MEET YOU OUTSIDE.

22:17.248 --> 22:20.295
IS THERE SOME KIND OF SERVICE
FOR LEONARD?

22:20.295 --> 22:21.992
TOMORROW AFTERNOON,
I BELIEVE.

22:21.992 --> 22:23.472
AH.

22:23.472 --> 22:24.865
THAT'S SUCH A SHAME.

22:24.865 --> 22:26.475
I'M GONNA TAKE THAT.

22:26.475 --> 22:28.825
AND I LIKE THIS ONE, TOO.

22:28.825 --> 22:31.393
IT'S REALLY BEAUTIFUL.
SO THAT AS WELL,

22:31.393 --> 22:33.917
AND, UM...

22:33.917 --> 22:36.877
THIS THING. I'LL SEE
IF I CAN GET A TUNE OUT OF THAT.

22:36.877 --> 22:40.010
JUST LOVE THOSE FEATHERS.
YEAH.MM.

22:40.010 --> 22:41.969
[plays notes]

22:41.969 --> 22:44.014
GRACE, HI. IT'S JANE.

22:44.014 --> 22:47.148
HOW'S IT GOING WITH JANE DOE
THERE? SHE GET A CLUE YET?

22:47.148 --> 22:48.758
MM, DIDN'T THINK SO.

22:48.758 --> 22:51.239
YOU KNOW, BRING HER
DOWN TO THE OFFICE.

22:51.239 --> 22:54.895
I THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GET
A LITTLE MORE INTERVENTIONIST.

22:54.895 --> 22:56.984
[Patrick] OKAY.

22:56.984 --> 23:00.291
IF YOU START TO FEEL DIZZY
OR WOOZY OR--OR ANYTHING--

23:00.291 --> 23:03.686
GRACE, QUIT HOVERING.
ALL RIGHT? SHE'S FINE.

23:03.686 --> 23:05.949
I TOOK HER
OUT OF THE HOSPITAL, JANE.

23:05.949 --> 23:08.952
SHE'S MY RESPONSIBILITY.I GET THAT, BUT SHE'S FINE.
AREN'T YOU?

23:08.952 --> 23:10.606
WHAT ARE THESE?

23:10.606 --> 23:13.566
OH, THESE ARE PICTURES
OF WHERE YOU'RE FROM.

23:13.566 --> 23:15.916
I DON'T KNOW
WHERE I'M FROM.

23:15.916 --> 23:17.613
SURE YOU DO.

23:17.613 --> 23:19.920
I'LL LAY MONEY ON THE FACT
THAT YOU'RE A LOCAL.

23:19.920 --> 23:22.575
YOU HAVE ROOTS AROUND HERE.

23:22.575 --> 23:25.621
YOU VISITED PLACES LIKE THIS
AS A KID.

23:25.621 --> 23:28.972
ONE OF THESE PICTURES HERE
WILL MEAN SOMETHING TO YOU.

23:28.972 --> 23:30.974
I GET NOTHING FROM THAT.

23:30.974 --> 23:33.890
WHAT ABOUT THIS? HMM?

23:33.890 --> 23:35.892
GRACE, A MINUTE?

23:35.892 --> 23:37.764
OH, SURE.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

23:37.764 --> 23:39.766
OKAY.

23:39.766 --> 23:40.897
THIS?

23:43.030 --> 23:44.858
MNH-MNH.

23:44.858 --> 23:46.860
JUST RELAX.
DON'T WORK SO HARD.

23:46.860 --> 23:48.296
LOOK AT THAT.

23:48.296 --> 23:49.950
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN

23:49.950 --> 23:52.996
A MORE BEAUTIFUL,
MORE PEACEFUL PLACE?

23:52.996 --> 23:56.217
IT WOULD BE COOL
IF I COULD JUST SAY THE WORD,

23:56.217 --> 23:58.437
AND YOU COULD BE
RIGHT THERE,

23:58.437 --> 24:02.310
LISTENING
TO THE BIRDS SING...

24:02.310 --> 24:05.835
[lowers voice] THE WIND RUSTLING
THROUGH THE TREES...

24:05.835 --> 24:10.536
THE WATER LAPPING
AGAINST THE SHORE.

24:10.536 --> 24:13.321
IF I COULD JUST SAY THE WORD.

24:15.497 --> 24:18.544
[telephone rings]

24:18.544 --> 24:21.764
[sighs]
WAYNE, THIS COULDN'T WAIT?

24:30.773 --> 24:33.341
THIS IS SO SIMPLE.

24:33.341 --> 24:35.561
I LOVE YOU...

24:35.561 --> 24:38.128
MORE THAN--MORE THAN THIS JOB,
MORE THAN ANYTHING.

24:38.128 --> 24:40.130
[sighs]
YOU GOT SHOT AT TODAY.

24:40.130 --> 24:42.785
YOU'RE PUMPED FULL
OF ADRENALINE.NO, NO.

24:42.785 --> 24:44.961
WELL, YES,
BUT THAT DOESN'T MATTER.

24:44.961 --> 24:46.963
[gulps]

24:46.963 --> 24:48.965
I KNOW WHAT I WANT TO DO.

24:48.965 --> 24:52.360
[inhales deeply]
I, UH...

24:52.360 --> 24:55.450
I TALKED TO A GUY IN
THE SAN FRANCISCO OFFICE TODAY.

24:55.450 --> 24:57.800
THERE'S AN OPENING
IN THE MAJOR CRIMES UNIT.

24:57.800 --> 25:00.803
IT'S ONLY
AN HOUR AND A HALF AWAY.

25:00.803 --> 25:04.546
YOU MEAN IT?PLEASE, LET'S JUST DO THIS.

25:04.546 --> 25:06.896
I-I DON'T CARE
WHERE I WORK.

25:06.896 --> 25:09.290
I-I WANT YOU.

25:09.290 --> 25:11.292
YOU REALLY MEAN IT?

25:11.292 --> 25:13.729
[whispers] YES, YES.

25:24.131 --> 25:25.959
REALLY? NOW?

25:25.959 --> 25:28.875
RANGER TISDALE SHOULD BE OFF
THE MOUNTAIN IN AN HOUR, SO...

25:28.875 --> 25:31.442
HIS BANK RECORDS SAY
HE'S DEPOSITING 2 GRAND A MONTH

25:31.442 --> 25:33.793
OVER AND ABOVE HIS SALARY--
CASH.

25:33.793 --> 25:35.708
LET'S GO TALK TO HIM.

25:42.889 --> 25:44.673
TISDALE.

25:46.109 --> 25:48.721
I WAS GONNA CALL YOU.
I JUST HEARD.

25:48.721 --> 25:51.201
POT FARM.
DOESN'T THAT BEAT EVERYTHING?

25:51.201 --> 25:54.596
YEAH,
RIGHT IN YOUR OWN WOODS.YEAH. I'VE BEEN HIKING
THESE TRAILS FOR EIGHT YEARS.

25:54.596 --> 25:57.164
I HAD NO IDEA. I DON'T KNOW
WHERE YOU ENDED UP,

25:57.164 --> 26:00.167
BUT YOU MUST'VE GOTTEN
SERIOUSLY TURNED AROUND.

26:00.167 --> 26:02.169
THAT'S HARD TO BELIEVE

26:02.169 --> 26:04.998
WHEN THE POT FARMERS ARE
PAYING YOU $2,000 A MONTH.

26:04.998 --> 26:08.871
2 TH--I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO COME WITH US.

26:08.871 --> 26:10.656
[thud]OH!

26:14.355 --> 26:16.749
[grunts][grunts]

26:16.749 --> 26:18.577
[both grunting]

26:21.536 --> 26:23.146
NICE WORK.

26:23.146 --> 26:25.584
[panting] FELT GOOD.
[chuckles]

26:27.455 --> 26:29.109
SEND YOU TO THE FARM?

26:29.109 --> 26:31.720
I WAS TRYING LIKE HELL
TO KEEP YOU AWAY FROM IT.

26:31.720 --> 26:34.244
ALL YOU HAD TO DO
WAS STAY ON THE TRAIL.

26:34.244 --> 26:37.465
IS THAT REALLY SO HARD?SO YOU WERE TAKING MONEY
FROM THE POT DEALERS

26:37.465 --> 26:40.207
TO PROTECT THEIR FARM,
RIGHT?[sighs] THEY WERE PAYING ME

26:40.207 --> 26:42.862
TO DIRECT TOURISTS AWAY
AND LET 'EM KNOW

26:42.862 --> 26:46.996
IF THERE WERE ANY LOCAL COPS
OR FEDS SNOOPING AROUND.

26:46.996 --> 26:49.912
OKAY, THESE PEOPLE WHO GOT
KILLED--I NEVER EVEN SAW THEM.

26:49.912 --> 26:52.872
I NEED THE NAMES
OF THE PEOPLE WHO PAID YOU.

26:52.872 --> 26:54.656
I CAN'T DO THAT.

26:54.656 --> 26:57.441
LOOK, THESE AREN'T HIPPIES

26:57.441 --> 26:59.443
GROWING WEED IN THE FOREST,
OKAY?

26:59.443 --> 27:01.358
THESE ARE
SERIOUS, SERIOUS MEN.

27:01.358 --> 27:04.057
IF THEY LEARN THAT
I GAVE UP THEIR NAMES,

27:04.057 --> 27:06.668
THEY'LL KILL ME.

27:06.668 --> 27:09.976
LOOK, THEY KNOW
YOU'VE BEEN ARRESTED.

27:09.976 --> 27:12.369
THEY THINK YOU'RE
GIVING THEM UP RIGHT NOW.

27:12.369 --> 27:14.981
NOW WITH THESE MEN WALKING
AROUND, YOU'RE IN DANGER.

27:14.981 --> 27:18.027
GIVE US THEIR NAMES,
AND WE'LL LOCK THEM UP.NO, I CAN'T.

27:18.027 --> 27:19.986
IT'S YOUR CALL.

27:19.986 --> 27:23.119
YOU GOT A FAMILY?UH, YEAH.

27:23.119 --> 27:25.339
WELL, I SUGGEST
YOU SEND THEM SOMEWHERE.

27:25.339 --> 27:27.820
NOT OUT OF TOWN--
GET 'EM OUT OF STATE.

27:27.820 --> 27:29.865
KNOW ANYBODY ON THE EAST COAST?NO.

27:29.865 --> 27:31.911
THAT'S TOO BAD.
HOW ABOUT OVERSEAS?

27:31.911 --> 27:34.609
THAT'S A FIRST-RATE INTERVIEWER
YOU GOT THERE.THANK YOU.

27:34.609 --> 27:36.437
HEY, WHAT'S UP?

27:36.437 --> 27:40.093
SO RIGSBY AND CHO TELL ME THERE
WAS ONLY ONE DUDE WITH A GUN.

27:40.093 --> 27:42.530
THAT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE MUCH.NO, IT'S NOT.

27:42.530 --> 27:44.445
SO WHEN YOU SAY,
"THESE ARE NOT HIPPIES,

27:44.445 --> 27:46.926
THESE ARE SERIOUS, SERIOUS MEN,"

27:46.926 --> 27:49.537
THAT IMPLIES MANY SCARY MEN
WITH LARGE GUNS, RIGHT?

27:49.537 --> 27:51.974
YES.SO WHY JUST ONE?

27:51.974 --> 27:54.803
I DON'T KNOW.
THEY MIGHT BE LOW ON MONEY.

27:54.803 --> 27:57.632
I MEAN,
THE--THE CROP IS DOING BADLY.PLANTS ARE DYING?

27:57.632 --> 28:00.635
YEAH, YEAH. AND THE WORD IS
THAT IT'S BEEN GOING ON

28:00.635 --> 28:03.377
FOR ABOUT SIX MONTHS,
AND NOBODY CAN FIGURE IT OUT,

28:03.377 --> 28:05.771
AND THEY'RE REALLY KIND OF
FREAKING OUT ABOUT IT.I'M SURE.

28:05.771 --> 28:08.164
JANE?YEAH?

28:08.164 --> 28:11.080
UH, I THINK I GOTTA--
I GOTTA GO. I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

28:11.080 --> 28:12.342
THANK YOU.

28:12.342 --> 28:14.388
SO WHAT'D YOU GET
FROM THE GUY?

28:14.388 --> 28:16.956
THE POT FARMERS
DIDN'T KILL LEONARD.THAT SO?

28:16.956 --> 28:18.958
YEP.YOU CERTAIN?

28:18.958 --> 28:22.091
WELL, CERTAINTY IS
THE MOTHER OF FOOLS.

28:22.091 --> 28:24.485
SO ALL THIS IS JUST...

28:24.485 --> 28:26.313
GUESSWORK WITH YOU?

28:26.313 --> 28:28.097
PRETTY MUCH.

28:28.097 --> 28:31.622
I MEAN, THAT'S--
THAT'S WHAT I DO, I GUESS.

28:31.622 --> 28:33.755
FOR INSTANCE,
I GUESS THAT YOU'RE MARRIED.

28:33.755 --> 28:35.539
I'M WEARING A RING.

28:35.539 --> 28:38.934
WELL, I GUESS THAT YOU'RE
MARRIED, BUT NOT HAPPILY.

28:38.934 --> 28:42.068
NOT THAT THERE'S
DIVORCE PROCEEDINGS IN PLACE,

28:42.068 --> 28:44.070
BUT...

28:44.070 --> 28:46.507
POSSIBLY A TRIAL SEPARATION.

28:46.507 --> 28:49.118
GUESS I SHOULD'VE
PUT UP A PHOTO, HUH?

28:49.118 --> 28:50.946
MM-HMM.

28:50.946 --> 28:54.036
I KNOW YOU'RE NOT GIVING ME
RELATIONSHIP ADVICE,

28:54.036 --> 28:56.865
SO I HAVE TO WONDER
WHY YOU WOULD GO THERE.

28:56.865 --> 29:00.216
I GUESS IT'S YOUR WAY
OF EXPRESSING UNHAPPINESS.

29:00.216 --> 29:02.305
MM, COULD BE.

29:02.305 --> 29:05.308
I GUESS
IT'S YOUR WAY OF SAYING

29:05.308 --> 29:08.616
YOU'RE UNHAPPY WITH THE WAY
I'M HANDLING LISBON.

29:08.616 --> 29:10.618
WE SPEND
A LOT OF TIME TOGETHER.

29:10.618 --> 29:14.840
AND WHEN SHE'S UNHAPPY,
UH, I'M LESS HAPPY.

29:14.840 --> 29:16.363
IT'S HUMAN NATURE.

29:16.363 --> 29:17.973
YES, IT IS.

29:17.973 --> 29:20.019
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,
PATRICK.

29:20.019 --> 29:23.065
WHY DON'T YOU LET ME
HANDLE MY BUSINESS MY WAY

29:23.065 --> 29:25.546
AND THEN JUDGE ME
BY THE RESULTS?

29:25.546 --> 29:28.070
AND I'LL LET YOU
HANDLE YOURS YOUR WAY...

29:28.070 --> 29:29.463
UP TO A POINT.

29:29.463 --> 29:31.073
THAT SOUNDS FAIR.

29:31.073 --> 29:33.075
UP TO A POINT.

29:33.075 --> 29:35.991
YEAH, VERY FAIR. WE DONE?

29:35.991 --> 29:37.427
NO.

29:37.427 --> 29:39.473
PLEASE DON'T INTERRUPT
INTERROGATIONS.

29:39.473 --> 29:41.780
IT'S RUDE.THAT'S A RULE, IS IT?

29:41.780 --> 29:43.607
GUIDELINE.

29:43.607 --> 29:45.871
I'LL KEEP IT IN MIND.

29:45.871 --> 29:47.394
NOW WE'RE DONE.

29:49.135 --> 29:52.051
LOVING THOSE PUMPS.

29:52.051 --> 29:54.227
THANK YOU.

29:54.227 --> 29:56.490
BYE.

29:56.490 --> 29:58.013
[blinds clatter]

29:58.013 --> 30:00.886
[typing]

30:04.454 --> 30:06.108
OH, WHAT'S THIS?
INTERESTING.

30:06.108 --> 30:07.327
[lowered voice]
WE NEED TO TAKE AMNESIA GIRL

30:07.327 --> 30:10.025
UP TO THE RESERVATION.

30:10.025 --> 30:13.289
MEET ME IN THE PARKING LOT
IN TEN MINUTES.[lowered voice] WHY TAKE HER
TO THE RESERVATION?

30:13.289 --> 30:15.726
THEY'RE HOLDING A MEMORIAL
FOR LEONARD RAILTON.

30:15.726 --> 30:19.034
SHE SHOULD BE THERE.
SHE MIGHT REMEMBER SOMETHING.WORTH A TRY, I GUESS.

30:19.034 --> 30:20.906
OH, DO ME A FAVOR.HMM?

30:20.906 --> 30:23.909
DON'T MENTION THIS
TO LISBON OR HIGHTOWER.AND WHY NOT?

30:23.909 --> 30:26.215
WELL, WHY COMPLICATE THINGS?COMPLICATE HOW?

30:26.215 --> 30:28.870
HELL, VAN PELT,
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TAKEN HER

30:28.870 --> 30:31.046
OUT OF THE HOSPITAL
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

30:31.046 --> 30:33.919
YOUR CAR,
PARKING LOT, TEN MINUTES.

30:33.919 --> 30:37.836
[man chanting in
Native American language]

30:39.620 --> 30:42.753
MR. JANE,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

30:42.753 --> 30:45.800
WELL, WE'RE HERE
TO PAY OUR RESPECTS.

30:45.800 --> 30:47.715
IT'S OKAY.
WE WON'T EAT MUCH.

30:47.715 --> 30:51.371
LEONARD HAD ONLY BEEN WITH US
A SHORT WHILE,

30:51.371 --> 30:53.721
BUT IF YOU SAW HIM

30:53.721 --> 30:56.898
WALKING A TRAIL UP AT THE LAKES
OR RIDING A HORSE,

30:56.898 --> 30:58.813
YOU COULD SEE

30:58.813 --> 31:00.902
THAT HE WAS HOME.

31:00.902 --> 31:03.470
SO REMEMBER THE OLD WORDS.

31:03.470 --> 31:05.472
WHEN A FRIEND DIES,

31:05.472 --> 31:06.865
WE SHOULD NOT CRY.

31:06.865 --> 31:10.172
WE SHOULD NOT HATE SOMEONE

31:10.172 --> 31:11.782
OR FIGHT.

31:11.782 --> 31:15.917
WE SHOULD DO RIGHT ALWAYS.

31:15.917 --> 31:18.528
AND WE SHOULD LISTEN
TO THE OLD WORDS

31:18.528 --> 31:20.966
AND REMEMBER LEONARD.

31:20.966 --> 31:24.534
IF ANYONE ELSE
HAS SOMETHING TO SAY...

31:24.534 --> 31:25.884
OH, I WOULD.

31:27.581 --> 31:30.149
THIS WOMAN WAS WITH LEONARD
WHEN HE WAS SHOT.

31:30.149 --> 31:32.151
SHE HAS LOST HER MEMORY.

31:32.151 --> 31:35.502
SO WE BROUGHT HER HERE TODAY

31:35.502 --> 31:37.896
TO SEE IF A FACE

31:37.896 --> 31:40.115
OR A PLACE OR ANYTHING

31:40.115 --> 31:42.509
COULD HELP HER REMEMBER
WHO SHE IS.

31:42.509 --> 31:46.730
THIS IS KIND OF A SACRED MOMENT.
IS THIS REALLY THE TIME?

31:46.730 --> 31:48.907
IT'LL TAKE BUT A SECOND.

31:53.346 --> 31:54.869
[Patrick] ANYTHING?

31:54.869 --> 31:57.916
NO.

31:57.916 --> 32:01.006
NEVER MIND. THE TRIP
WAS NOT ENTIRELY WASTED.

32:01.006 --> 32:05.271
I WAS ALSO LOOKING AT ALL OF YOU
TO SEE IF ANYONE RECOGNIZED HER.

32:05.271 --> 32:09.492
AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT SOMEBODY
HERE DOESKNOW THIS WOMAN.

32:09.492 --> 32:12.408
AND THAT SOMEBODY
IS YOU, SIR.

32:12.408 --> 32:14.454
ME?

32:14.454 --> 32:17.065
I THINK YOU'RE MISTAKEN.

32:17.065 --> 32:18.806
PROVE IT.

32:18.806 --> 32:20.677
[grunts] HOW?

32:22.984 --> 32:24.812
LOOK INTO MY EYES

32:24.812 --> 32:26.422
AND HOLD THIS.

32:30.035 --> 32:33.081
NOW TELL ME
YOU DON'T KNOW HER.

32:33.081 --> 32:35.127
I DO NOT KNOW THIS WOMAN.

32:38.043 --> 32:39.958
OKAY.

32:39.958 --> 32:41.960
UM, UM, OKAY.

32:41.960 --> 32:44.005
IT APPEARS
THAT I'M MISTAKEN,

32:44.005 --> 32:46.529
WHICH IS VERY GOOD FOR YOU.

32:46.529 --> 32:48.923
THAT ELIMINATES YOU
FROM OUR INQUIRY.

32:48.923 --> 32:50.969
MY APOLOGIES. CARRY ON. WE'LL
JUST TAKE OUR SEATS IN THE BACK.

32:50.969 --> 32:52.709
THANK YOU.

32:52.709 --> 32:56.104
AND, LISTEN, IF YOU--
IF YOU DON'T WANT US HERE,

32:56.104 --> 32:58.280
THEN JUST SAY THE WORD
AND WE'LL GO. JUST SAY THE WORD.

32:58.280 --> 33:01.762
[Joseph] I THINK
IT WOULD BE BETTER--I SEE IT.

33:01.762 --> 33:05.157
I SEE IT! I SEE IT! I SEE IT!

33:05.157 --> 33:08.073
I SEE IT.

33:08.073 --> 33:12.077
[laughing]

33:15.515 --> 33:19.475
NOW JUST RELAX, BREATHE
AND TELL US WHAT YOU SEE.

33:19.475 --> 33:22.478
THERE'S A BLUE LAKE...

33:22.478 --> 33:25.090
PINE TREES...

33:25.090 --> 33:27.135
A MOUNTAIN...

33:27.135 --> 33:28.832
THERE'S A BIRD SINGING.

33:32.271 --> 33:35.143
TELL US WHAT'S HAPPENING
AT THIS LAKE.

33:35.143 --> 33:37.493
IT'S WHERE
THE BAD THING HAPPENED.

33:37.493 --> 33:40.714
WHAT BAD THING?

33:40.714 --> 33:42.759
GO LOOK. THEY...

33:42.759 --> 33:45.501
THEY LEFT SOMETHING
ON THE SHORE.

33:45.501 --> 33:48.113
WHO DID?GO LOOK.
THEY LEFT SOMETHING.

33:48.113 --> 33:50.289
[whispers]
THEY LEFT SOMETHING.

33:55.076 --> 33:57.078
I'M SORRY.

33:57.078 --> 33:59.863
OKAY, SHOW'S OVER. COME ON.

33:59.863 --> 34:01.909
WATCH YOUR HEAD.

34:01.909 --> 34:04.477
SO MR. SILVERWING IS
GONNA COMPLAIN TO OUR SUPERIORS

34:04.477 --> 34:06.522
IN THE STRONGEST TERMS.
NICE WORK.

34:06.522 --> 34:09.960
SEE, THAT'S WHY I DIDN'T BRING
YOU ALONG--DENIABILITY.

34:09.960 --> 34:13.834
HOW DID YOU KNOW WE WERE HERE?I HAD LITTLE, TINY
G.P.S. TRACKERS

34:13.834 --> 34:15.836
SEWN INTO ALL YOUR SUITS.

34:15.836 --> 34:19.840
FOR A SECOND THERE, I ALMOST
BELIEVED YOU. GRACE?

34:19.840 --> 34:23.539
SORRY, JANE.
I HAD TO TELL HER. IT'S MY JOB.EH, THAT'S NOT IT.

34:23.539 --> 34:26.238
GET HER BACK TO THE HOSPITAL.YES, BOSS.

34:26.238 --> 34:28.153
SHE DIDREMEMBER SOMETHING.
WE HAVE A CLUE.

34:28.153 --> 34:31.025
A LAKE IN THE MOUNTAIN,
SOMETHING ON THE SHORE?

34:31.025 --> 34:34.289
COULD BE WHERE
THE MURDERS HAPPENED.THERE'S OVER 50 LAKES
IN THOSE MOUNTAINS!

34:34.289 --> 34:38.250
I'LL TAKE HER BACK
TO THE HOSPITAL.LISTEN, I'M SORRY I DIDN'T
TELL YOU WHERE I WAS GOING.

34:38.250 --> 34:40.078
I WASTRYING
TO PROTECT YOU.

34:40.078 --> 34:42.384
I KNEW I WAS
GONNA STIR THINGS UP,

34:42.384 --> 34:46.084
AND, WHAT, WITH HIGHTOWER ALL-- DON'T.DON'T EVER TRY
TO PROTECT ME.

34:46.084 --> 34:48.825
I CAN PROTECT MYSELF
FROM HIGHTOWER OR ANYBODY ELSE.OKAY.

34:48.825 --> 34:52.264
LET'S GO BACK
TO THE OFFICE.WE COULD.
OR WE COULD STAY HERE

34:52.264 --> 34:55.441
AND CATCH
LEONARD RAILTON'S KILLER.HOW ARE WE GONNA DO THAT?

34:55.441 --> 34:57.486
I NEED A CUP.

34:57.486 --> 35:00.054
PAPER OR PLASTIC--
I'D PREFER PAPER.[car door opens]

35:02.535 --> 35:06.016
[car door slams]SO JANE DOE
DIDN'T REMEMBER THE LAKE?

35:06.016 --> 35:07.714
POSTHYPNOTIC SUGGESTION.

35:07.714 --> 35:10.412
I SHOWED HER A BEAUTIFUL PICTURE
OF A LAKE AND TOLD HER

35:10.412 --> 35:12.980
THAT SHE WOULD REMEMBER IT WHEN
SHE HEARD THE TRIGGER PHRASE--

35:12.980 --> 35:15.591
"SAY THE WORD." SHE REMEMBERED
THE PICTURE, ASSOCIATED IT

35:15.591 --> 35:18.855
WITH THE CRIME AND FELT THAT
SOMETHING WAS LEFT BEHIND THERE.WHAT SOMETHING?

35:18.855 --> 35:20.466
WELL, IT--IT DOESN'T MATTER.

35:20.466 --> 35:23.208
THE KILLER'S FEELING
PARANOID NOW, SO HE OR SHE

35:23.208 --> 35:26.254
WILL BE COMPELLED TO GO BACK
TO THE SCENE OF THE CRIME

35:26.254 --> 35:30.606
AND MAKE SURE THAT
NOTHING WAS LEFT BEHIND.THAT'S ASSUMING THE MURDER
OCCURRED AT THE LAKE.

35:30.606 --> 35:33.261
WELL, IT DID.BECAUSE?

35:33.261 --> 35:35.829
BECAUSETHE POT CROP DIED,
AND LEONARD RAILTON WAS WORRIED

35:35.829 --> 35:37.831
ABOUT THE WATER HIS
GIRLFRIEND'S BABY WAS GETTING.

35:37.831 --> 35:40.877
HEY, IT'S OVER HERE.AND THE WATER SUPPLY
FOR AROUND HERE

35:40.877 --> 35:43.010
COMES FROM THE MOUNTAIN LAKES.

35:43.010 --> 35:45.186
CHO FOLLOWED THE KILLER
AFTER THE MEMORIAL.

35:45.186 --> 35:47.536
AND? WHO IS IT?WE'LL SEE.

35:49.973 --> 35:51.975
WHERE IS HE?

35:51.975 --> 35:54.152
[Cho]
STRAIGHT THROUGH THE TREES.

35:57.067 --> 35:59.157
[tapping][Cho] HANDS UP.

35:59.157 --> 36:01.550
WHAT'S GOING ON?GET YOUR HANDS UP.

36:01.550 --> 36:04.162
NO, I-I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

36:05.946 --> 36:08.296
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

36:09.906 --> 36:11.299
RIFLE SHELL.

36:11.299 --> 36:13.258
WHERE'D YOU GET THAT,
MR. WILLIS?

36:13.258 --> 36:15.129
I JUST FOUND IT.

36:15.129 --> 36:17.131
I WAS GONNA GIVE IT TO YOU.

36:17.131 --> 36:20.134
DO YOU THINK
IT'S CONNECTED TO THOSE MURDERS?[laughing]

36:20.134 --> 36:23.093
THAT'S THE BEST YOU GOT?WHY'D YOU SHOOT
THOSE FOUR PEOPLE, MR. WILLIS?

36:23.093 --> 36:26.096
I DIDN'T.WELL, KEEP IN MIND
THAT TWO OF THEM--

36:26.096 --> 36:29.056
THE LANGHAMS--THEY WERE,
UH, BY-PRODUCTS, LATECOMERS.

36:29.056 --> 36:32.320
BUT LEONARD...

36:32.320 --> 36:35.497
LEONARD YOU KILLED BECAUSE OF
WHAT'S IN THE LAKE, DIDN'T YOU?

36:35.497 --> 36:38.239
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

36:38.239 --> 36:40.328
TOXIC WASTE.

36:40.328 --> 36:42.504
GREAT, BIG BARRELS OF IT,
I EXPECT.

36:42.504 --> 36:44.114
DUMPED BY YOU.

36:44.114 --> 36:47.292
THAT'S WHY THE POT PLANTS
IN THE VALLEY WERE DYING.

36:47.292 --> 36:49.816
THAT'S WHY DERRIEN HOPWOOD'S
CHILD GOT A RASH.

36:49.816 --> 36:52.035
LEONARD WAS GONNA TELL,

36:52.035 --> 36:54.473
SO YOU HAD TO SHOOT HIM.

36:54.473 --> 36:58.128
AND ANYONE ELSE THAT JUST...
HAPPENED TO COME ALONG THAT DAY.

36:58.128 --> 37:00.305
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

37:00.305 --> 37:02.785
THAT IS NOTTRUE.

37:02.785 --> 37:05.571
WELL, THIS IS GROUND ZERO
FOR THE DUMPING,

37:05.571 --> 37:08.487
SO THE WATER HERE MUST BE
MUCH MORE TOXIC

37:08.487 --> 37:11.011
THAN IT IS DOWN IN THE VALLEY.THAT IS NONSENSE!

37:11.011 --> 37:12.621
[Patrick] REALLY?

37:12.621 --> 37:15.189
FEELING A LITTLE PARCHED?
HAVE A DRINK.

37:15.189 --> 37:16.582
NO.

37:16.582 --> 37:19.541
NO.WHY NOT?

37:19.541 --> 37:22.196
OH, COME ON.
CHEERS. HAVE A DRINK.NO.

37:22.196 --> 37:24.154
LITTLE SIP.NO. NO, PLEASE, STOP.
NO!

37:24.154 --> 37:25.852
[grunts] ALL RIGHT!

37:25.852 --> 37:29.812
I TRIED TO GET SO MANY IDEAS
ACROSS THE TRIBAL COUNCIL.

37:29.812 --> 37:33.207
[sighs]
BUT SOMEBODY DIDN'T LIKE IT,

37:33.207 --> 37:35.253
OR IT WASN'T
CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE,

37:35.253 --> 37:37.820
OR BLAH, DE, BLAH, DE, BLAH.

37:37.820 --> 37:40.301
SO THIS GUY SAID

37:40.301 --> 37:42.216
HE NEEDED TO DUMP
SOME STUFF,

37:42.216 --> 37:46.873
AND DID I KNOW ANY PLACE
ON THE REZ THAT HE COULD DO IT?

37:46.873 --> 37:49.876
SO I HAD LEONARD TAKE THEM
UP TO THE LAKE.

37:49.876 --> 37:52.400
WELL, I FIGURED WITH HIS RECORD,
HE'D TAKE THE MONEY

37:52.400 --> 37:55.577
AND KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT.

37:55.577 --> 37:57.231
WELL, WE WENT WELL.

37:58.798 --> 38:00.930
[thud] GOT MORE TRUCKS UP THERE.

38:00.930 --> 38:03.368
I MEAN, SOMETHING WAS
FINALLY WORKING FOR ME.

38:05.326 --> 38:08.286
AND THEN THAT KID IN THE VALLEY
GOT A RASH.

38:08.286 --> 38:10.331
AND LEONARD WAS WORRIED.

38:10.331 --> 38:12.638
SAID WEWERE
POISONING THE VALLEY,

38:12.638 --> 38:17.338
AND IF WE DIDN'T STOP, THAT
HE WAS GONNA BLOW THE WHISTLE.

38:17.338 --> 38:21.168
THEN I OVERHEARD HIM
ON THE PHONE,

38:21.168 --> 38:24.040
ARRANGING TO MEET SOMEBODY
UP AT THE LAKE.

38:26.216 --> 38:28.436
SO I WENT, TOO.

38:32.919 --> 38:34.834
[gunshot]

38:37.097 --> 38:39.055
[gunshot]

38:39.055 --> 38:41.101
WHEN DID THE LANGHAMS
GET THERE?

38:41.101 --> 38:42.972
I WAS CLEANING UP.

38:46.889 --> 38:49.022
YOU KNOW,
WHAT THEY DOING THERE, ANYWAY?

38:49.022 --> 38:50.806
[gunshot]

38:50.806 --> 38:52.199
[gunshot]

38:52.199 --> 38:55.158
UM,
THEY WERE TAKING A HIKE?

38:55.158 --> 38:57.073
[sighs]

39:00.163 --> 39:03.384
[voice breaking] I'M SORRY.

39:03.384 --> 39:06.169
I AM.

39:06.169 --> 39:07.606
[whispers] I'M SORRY.

39:09.956 --> 39:11.958
WELL, THAT'S OKAY, THEN.

39:11.958 --> 39:15.527
AS LONG AS YOU'RE SORRY.
MAYBE WE'LL JUST LET YOU GO.

39:21.010 --> 39:22.969
I'M KIDDING.

39:24.971 --> 39:26.799
[knock on window]

39:30.063 --> 39:33.153
HEY.
GOT SOMETHING FOR YOU.

39:33.153 --> 39:35.155
YOUR DRIVER'S LICENSE.

39:35.155 --> 39:37.505
WE GOT IT
FROM MARKHAM WILLIS.

39:39.246 --> 39:42.728
YOUR NAME IS CAMILLE DILLON.
YOU LIVE IN OAKLAND.

39:42.728 --> 39:45.252
YOU'RE AN INTERNET JOURNALIST
AND WRITER.

39:45.252 --> 39:47.254
WE CONTACTED YOUR FAMILY.

39:47.254 --> 39:49.691
YOUR MOM IS ON HER WAY
FROM DES MOINES.

39:51.476 --> 39:53.826
MY NAME IS CAMILLE?

39:53.826 --> 39:55.828
APPARENTLY,
YOU TAUGHT LEONARD RAILTON

39:55.828 --> 39:58.047
WHILE HE WAS
IN THE JUVENILE SYSTEM.

39:58.047 --> 40:01.181
A LITTLE WHILE AGO,
HE GOT IN TOUCH WITH YOU ABOUT--

40:01.181 --> 40:02.748
WAIT.

40:02.748 --> 40:06.665
SOMETHING...
SOMETHING WAS WRONG.

40:06.665 --> 40:08.928
THEY WERE...

40:08.928 --> 40:12.061
SOMEONE WAS, UH, DUMPING...

40:12.061 --> 40:14.499
TOXINS.Y-YES.

40:14.499 --> 40:19.025
AND HE--
HE WANTED PEOPLE TO KNOW. HE...

40:19.025 --> 40:21.070
HE CALLED...

40:21.070 --> 40:23.682
AND HE--HE ASKED
FOR MY HELP.

40:23.682 --> 40:25.466
I REM--

40:25.466 --> 40:26.989
I REMEMBER HIM.

40:29.688 --> 40:32.691
I REMEMBER HIM
ASKING FOR MY HELP.

40:32.691 --> 40:34.214
[sniffles and whispers]
I REMEMBER.

40:36.085 --> 40:38.523
I REMEMBER ME.

40:38.523 --> 40:42.614
[voice breaking]
I KNOW WHO I AM.

40:51.666 --> 40:53.886
HEY. JUST LET ME
FINISH THIS UP,

40:53.886 --> 40:56.671
AND WE'LL GO
TALK TO HIGHTOWER.

40:56.671 --> 40:58.151
WAYNE...

40:58.151 --> 40:59.979
WHAT'S UP?

41:02.068 --> 41:06.028
I LOVE YOU. I DO.

41:06.028 --> 41:09.031
BUT I THINK
I LOVE THE JOB MORE.

41:09.031 --> 41:11.991
WELL, JOB'S NOT A PROBLEM.
I'M GONNA GO.

41:11.991 --> 41:14.907
YOU'D BE LEAVING THE UNIT...
FOR US.

41:14.907 --> 41:16.909
SO?

41:16.909 --> 41:19.651
I DON'T WANT
THAT RESPONSIBILITY.

41:19.651 --> 41:21.827
YOU'LL HATE ME FOR IT.

41:21.827 --> 41:24.873
[voice breaking] MAYBE NOT
TODAY, BUT SOMEDAY YOU WILL.NO, GRACE, WE--WE--

41:24.873 --> 41:26.745
[whispers] I'M SORRY.

41:32.011 --> 41:34.013
YOU'RE, UH...

41:34.013 --> 41:36.058
CERTAIN ABOUT THIS?

41:36.058 --> 41:40.541
I KNOW WHO I AM.

41:42.238 --> 41:44.719
[chair rolls]

41:51.944 --> 41:53.772
NARCOTICS PICKED UP
THE POT FARMERS

41:53.772 --> 41:55.338
OFF THE RANGER'S CONFESSION.

41:55.338 --> 41:58.603
I ALSO GOT A CALL
FROM A GUY NAMED SILVERWING

41:58.603 --> 42:02.563
ABOUT A STUNT YOU PULLED UP ON
THE STORM RIVER RESERVATION.WELL, I WOULDN'T CALL THAT
A STUNT SO M--

42:02.563 --> 42:05.566
WHATEVER. HE WAS DISPLEASED.YES, MA'AM.
I FILLED OUT A P-90--

42:05.566 --> 42:07.742
YOU SOLVED THE TRIPLE,
RIGHT?YEAH.

42:07.742 --> 42:09.788
NOBODY GOT HURT?[Patrick] NO.

42:09.788 --> 42:12.399
THEN THE HELL WITH HIM.
YOU GOT JUSTICE DONE.

42:12.399 --> 42:14.619
KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK.

42:19.493 --> 42:21.495
THAT WAS UNEXPECTED.

42:21.495 --> 42:23.410
I'LL SAY.

42:27.675 --> 42:29.068
HEY, GRACE.

42:29.068 --> 42:31.505
HI. [sniffles][elevator bell dings]

42:31.505 --> 42:33.333
YOU ALL RIGHT?[crying] I'M FINE.

42:33.333 --> 42:35.422
OKAY, BUT...[sobbing]

42:35.422 --> 42:36.945
YEAH, I-I JUST...

42:40.383 --> 42:43.561
I JUST, UH, FORGOT MY... STUFF.

42:43.561 --> 42:46.476
[continues sobbing]

42:51.220 --> 42:54.006
STAY TUNED FOR SCENES
FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.
