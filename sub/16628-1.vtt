01:02.717 --> 01:05.680
So, Connie, is that short for something?

01:05.758 --> 01:09.361
Technically, Constance.
No one ever calls me that though.

01:09.437 --> 01:11.403
Anyway, I got back a week ago
and I was like...

01:11.480 --> 01:14.336
"...Oh, my God, where I am gonna live?"

01:14.413 --> 01:17.604
- Well, this is the room.
- I was mostly traveling on my own...

01:17.680 --> 01:20.777
...but then I spent two months
with this amazing group of botanists...

01:20.854 --> 01:22.481
...in the rain forest.

01:22.558 --> 01:25.008
Did you, uh, did you take
a boat on the Amazon?

01:25.085 --> 01:29.265
I don't swim, so there was no way.
Oh, I love the light in here.

01:29.341 --> 01:32.085
- Yeah, it's nice. Right?
- Yeah.

01:32.798 --> 01:35.313
Leslie, the girl who just moved out...

01:35.678 --> 01:38.161
...she actually went to Chicago
to do Development studies.

01:38.237 --> 01:40.817
Really? That's exactly
what I was thinking of.

01:40.894 --> 01:43.278
I would love to do that.
I mean, that or Environmental Law.

01:43.355 --> 01:45.701
I don't know, I'm still exploring.

01:55.773 --> 01:57.842
- What's your name, sir? What's your name?
- Mike.

01:57.919 --> 02:01.425
Mike, my name is Paige, I'm a nurse.
I'm gonna be taking care of you.

02:01.502 --> 02:05.489
Can you take a deep breath in through
your nose, out through your mouth.

02:05.565 --> 02:08.241
There we go, in through your nose.

02:08.318 --> 02:09.633
Out through your mouth.

02:22.462 --> 02:24.496
And now, ladies and gentlemen...

02:24.572 --> 02:26.653
...our beautiful Mae must bid everyone...

02:26.729 --> 02:30.641
...good night, and goodbye.

03:54.845 --> 03:57.361
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

04:01.181 --> 04:04.272
Barbara's already texted asking how it went.

04:04.349 --> 04:08.273
Yeah? It was sweet of her
to invite me to the wedding.

04:09.213 --> 04:12.335
I don't know anyone here
outside of work. So...

04:13.213 --> 04:15.793
So, you were a teacher back in the States?

04:18.716 --> 04:21.293
Yeah. I taught...

04:22.239 --> 04:25.330
- ...for a bit.
- And what did you teach?

04:26.701 --> 04:28.637
A little of everything.

04:30.749 --> 04:34.544
- We don't have to... if you don't wanna go.
- No, I want to. I want to.

04:34.621 --> 04:36.786
- It's fine.
- I want to.

04:37.438 --> 04:40.211
I was a teacher back home for, um...

04:42.397 --> 04:44.536
...eight years, then I...

04:47.869 --> 04:49.841
...then I came here.

04:49.918 --> 04:52.055
And, um...

06:11.229 --> 06:13.793
Tom. I'm gonna go down and eat something.

06:14.013 --> 06:17.367
Did you read the AgReport
on rotational grazing?

06:17.789 --> 06:20.944
- I saw it, I haven't read it.
- It's so full of distortions.

06:21.021 --> 06:23.856
- It's unbelievable.
- That's why I haven't read it.

06:23.933 --> 06:27.249
Well, I'm writing Conners.
He needs to know what they're producing.

06:27.661 --> 06:31.037
- Yeah.
- I'm being polite, I swear. Okay?

06:33.373 --> 06:36.912
- You wanna come down?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:36.989 --> 06:40.689
Just hitting "send".

06:41.533 --> 06:44.113
I wanna see the fall grazing trends,
I bet they conform.

06:44.189 --> 06:47.441
- Don't send anything off yet, okay?
- I promised to send a draft last Friday.

06:47.517 --> 06:50.446
I know, but I just wanna see
the fall trends, Clyde.

06:50.523 --> 06:53.872
This thing's gotta be ironclad
when we go to committee.

06:53.949 --> 06:57.638
- Okay. Okay, I'll hold off.
- Thank you.

07:00.829 --> 07:02.644
Thank you.

08:15.293 --> 08:17.074
Can you pass the salt?

08:17.151 --> 08:18.673
Sure.

08:19.517 --> 08:20.979
Thanks.

08:36.893 --> 08:38.674
Thank you.

08:41.063 --> 08:42.539
It's a brackish lake...

08:42.615 --> 08:46.180
...and it has this incredible reed
that regulates the salt level...

08:46.257 --> 08:49.392
...and that allows
this one species of leech to thrive.

08:49.469 --> 08:53.296
It's the only place in the world you
find them. They can't exist anywhere else.

08:53.373 --> 08:56.642
- Really? And you were dissecting them?
- Yep.

08:56.719 --> 09:01.535
I pretty much lived in a Tasmanian
marsh from the age of 24.

09:02.237 --> 09:05.745
We discovered that these leeches produced
a peptide in their salivary glands...

09:05.821 --> 09:08.177
...that might be useful in treating cancer.

09:08.733 --> 09:11.588
- Cancer? Wow. This...
- Yeah.

09:11.665 --> 09:14.385
- ...this sounds like amazing work.
- I know.

09:14.461 --> 09:19.312
I mean, well, I was really just a lab runt
so... I can't claim, you know.

09:19.389 --> 09:20.784
- Sure, sure.
- Yeah.

09:20.861 --> 09:22.322
Um...

09:23.645 --> 09:27.888
You do realize that most of us
can't stand our cafeteria.

09:27.965 --> 09:29.872
- Really?
- Yeah.

09:29.949 --> 09:33.440
You know, I might not be
the only infiltrator.

09:33.517 --> 09:36.608
Mm, there's like a million lunch places
in this neighborhood.

09:36.685 --> 09:39.584
I know, I know.
I just haven't had time to explore.

09:39.661 --> 09:42.944
Plus, I'm out on Long Island half the time.

09:43.021 --> 09:45.056
Right. Hunting frogs.

09:45.132 --> 09:47.136
Hunting frogs.

10:41.773 --> 10:43.584
That's the whole point of how we laid it out.

10:43.661 --> 10:47.648
You know, I started with the conceptual
framework we originally agreed on.

10:48.109 --> 10:51.200
And then I layered in exactly how
to handle all the regulatory hurdles...

10:51.276 --> 10:55.010
...so they'd be in a position where
they could actually, you know...

10:56.909 --> 10:58.784
Are you listening, Ramina?

10:58.861 --> 11:00.801
"In a position to..."

11:01.319 --> 11:05.340
Nothing. Just hopefully the guy at Agriculture
will actually pass it up to the deputy...

11:05.417 --> 11:07.616
...so we can move forward.

11:07.692 --> 11:11.904
I finally feel like I framed it in a way where
they really have to move on it. You know?

11:11.981 --> 11:15.392
- And what's Clyde say?
- Very supportive.

11:15.469 --> 11:18.049
What's the story with this biologist?

11:18.605 --> 11:20.960
She's just a friend, he says.

11:21.036 --> 11:22.273
But he said it three times.

11:22.349 --> 11:24.680
- Ah.
- Yeah.

11:26.092 --> 11:30.577
I don't know. I hear myself out loud
and the whole thing seems futile.

11:34.221 --> 11:37.149
You are a brilliant and inspiring man.

11:38.477 --> 11:40.672
You wanna have a threesome for my birthday?

11:40.749 --> 11:44.287
Wow, your Farsi is getting much better.

11:45.035 --> 11:47.776
Your laugh makes me wet.

11:47.853 --> 11:49.728
- I know that one.
- Uh-huh.

11:49.805 --> 11:52.925
That's why you should laugh more.

11:53.773 --> 11:56.416
Orange cows are laughing in outer space.

11:56.493 --> 11:58.273
You don't say.

11:58.829 --> 12:00.641
Not quite.

12:01.101 --> 12:02.849
I like this one.

12:03.117 --> 12:04.934
Makes you look gorgeous.

12:10.348 --> 12:13.248
So, when will this project
come up in committee?

12:13.613 --> 12:15.745
September, I think.

12:16.972 --> 12:19.104
They cannot do it earlier?

12:19.181 --> 12:21.508
I don't control the schedule, honey.

12:24.044 --> 12:27.201
How will Clyde handle it
if you won't be around by then?

12:27.469 --> 12:30.404
Uh... this fucking cake...

12:31.053 --> 12:34.048
- Tom.
- Yeah? I don't know.

12:34.125 --> 12:36.640
I mean, we haven't really talked about it.

12:36.717 --> 12:39.519
But after this big push I've been making...

12:39.596 --> 12:43.297
...I can't exactly say I'm not gonna
be around to see it through.

12:44.141 --> 12:48.224
There are thousands of farmers depending
on the legislation. It's important.

12:48.300 --> 12:50.757
But my jewelry is only jewelry?

12:53.325 --> 12:54.979
- We agreed.
- We didn't agree.

12:55.056 --> 12:57.888
- I want to go to California.
- So go.

12:57.965 --> 12:59.556
Alone?

13:08.749 --> 13:13.200
Unbelievable. I gotta deal with
this cake before the bakery closes.

13:13.277 --> 13:15.085
You didn't do it already?

13:16.301 --> 13:18.400
I'm sorry, I should have checked it.

13:18.477 --> 13:21.634
Just... dress the hens for me, would ya?

13:27.181 --> 13:28.960
Can we finish this conversation?

13:29.037 --> 13:30.792
No, I...

13:36.109 --> 13:37.889
You're early.

13:38.733 --> 13:41.472
- You're leaving.
- Hi, my dear. Come in.

13:41.549 --> 13:43.303
How are you, dear?

13:44.588 --> 13:46.272
Mark is on his way.

13:46.348 --> 13:48.103
I'll be right back.

13:50.413 --> 13:53.505
I tried to read your paper about the leeches.

13:54.157 --> 13:56.416
- You've been Googling.
- I've been Googling.

13:56.493 --> 13:59.968
I only got about as far as the third
paragraph. The writing was a little dense.

14:00.044 --> 14:02.720
Yeah, well, don't blame me.
I was just the research assistant.

14:02.797 --> 14:04.992
I'm surprised that came up.

14:05.069 --> 14:08.384
That and this great picture of you.

14:08.940 --> 14:10.723
- The one with the leeches?
- Yeah.

14:10.800 --> 14:12.928
Oh, God. I really wanna
get that one taken down.

14:13.005 --> 14:15.717
No, no. I thought it was endearing.

14:17.836 --> 14:20.800
- I appreciate you inviting me tonight.
- Oh, yeah.

14:20.877 --> 14:23.136
No problem. It's a great group.
I really think you'll like them.

14:23.213 --> 14:25.375
- Yeah.
- You said you wanted to meet people.

14:25.452 --> 14:28.447
- I do.
- They're people, so...

14:28.524 --> 14:30.752
...maybe we need a safe word though
in case it isn't going well.

14:30.829 --> 14:34.720
- Like what?
- Like I say, "Potato famine."

14:35.468 --> 14:37.536
- "Potato famine?"
- Yeah.

14:37.613 --> 14:40.544
Well, that's really easy to work
into any conversation.

14:40.620 --> 14:43.744
Sure, everybody left
during the potato famine.

14:44.396 --> 14:45.857
Okay.

14:49.644 --> 14:50.623
Hello.

14:50.700 --> 14:52.898
- Oh, hi.
- Come in, come in.

14:55.180 --> 14:57.088
Ramina, this is Alice.

14:57.165 --> 15:00.477
- Hi, pleasure to meet you.
- Please, come in, come in.

15:07.917 --> 15:10.265
<i>The sounds just
completely envelope you and...</i>

15:10.342 --> 15:14.400
...you sink in and you become
absorbed by living music.

15:14.476 --> 15:16.416
Of frogs?

15:16.492 --> 15:18.015
- Yeah, of frogs.
- Of frogs?

15:18.092 --> 15:23.744
And... and screech owls,
tree crickets, mosquitoes.

15:23.820 --> 15:28.127
I swear, I mean, I'm barely out of the city,
but I feel like I could be back in Tasmania.

15:28.204 --> 15:32.089
- And where is it again?
- It's near Northport, it's the Campbell Bog.

15:32.166 --> 15:34.208
And it is this frog
that brought you to New York?

15:34.284 --> 15:36.992
Yes, it did. Yes.

15:37.068 --> 15:43.072
Well, it's the first new frog that's been
identified in North America in 27 years.

15:43.149 --> 15:47.456
I mean, you wouldn't know it was
a new species if it wasn't for its song.

15:47.533 --> 15:49.512
- Play them the recording.
- Really?

15:49.589 --> 15:52.864
- Come on. You guys have to hear this.
- No!

15:52.941 --> 15:55.745
- You wanna hear the frogs sing?
- Yeah, sure.

15:55.822 --> 15:57.535
- Really?
- Play it.

15:57.612 --> 15:59.746
She played it for me and I cried.

16:06.828 --> 16:10.367
She promised me a copy of this
for my white noise machine.

16:10.444 --> 16:14.530
- That's in Long Island?
- It's not even an hour away.

16:15.341 --> 16:16.999
- That's gorgeous.
- Huh.

16:32.188 --> 16:35.345
- I feel completely ridiculous. I'm sorry.
- Why?

16:35.421 --> 16:38.192
Let me put this away immediately, I'm sorry.

16:38.269 --> 16:40.752
- Play it.
- Quite enough.

16:40.828 --> 16:42.800
- Enough of that.
- Nice.

16:42.877 --> 16:46.256
- Hush, please, are you kidding?
- Your necklace is beautiful.

16:46.332 --> 16:50.352
Ah, okay, that is cheating.
But points for coaching.

16:50.428 --> 16:53.391
- I didn't, I swear.
- What do you mean?

16:53.468 --> 16:57.372
The necklace is Ramina's.
She has a line of jewelry.

16:57.448 --> 17:00.592
- It's not a line yet.
- It will be.

17:01.053 --> 17:04.304
What do you mean? You mean you made it?

17:04.380 --> 17:06.863
- Yes.
- This is your work?

17:06.940 --> 17:11.103
Oh, my God. It's beautiful.
It's stunning. Absolutely amazing.

17:11.180 --> 17:13.455
- And she has good taste.
- What kind of stone is that?

17:13.532 --> 17:16.112
- It's a gold quartz. I cut them myself.
- I want to see the rest.

17:16.189 --> 17:19.343
- Later. Please, more wine.
- Could I use your powder room?

17:19.420 --> 17:22.958
- Absolutely, it's just up the stairs.
- Thank you.

17:29.531 --> 17:30.767
Clyde.

17:30.844 --> 17:33.580
All right, take it easy. Take it easy.

17:36.156 --> 17:38.447
Hey, is Tom coming to his
own birthday, where is he?

17:38.524 --> 17:41.871
He's at the bakery.
We had some problems with the cake.

17:41.948 --> 17:44.495
There was some confusion about his name.

18:32.317 --> 18:34.608
- You look like you need a drink.
- Happy birthday.

18:34.685 --> 18:35.983
- Oh, yeah.
- Happy birthday.

18:36.060 --> 18:38.995
Thank you, Mark. Thank you, everybody.

18:40.284 --> 18:42.415
Hey, buddy. Yeah, yeah. Thanks.

18:42.492 --> 18:44.880
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks, fella.

18:45.436 --> 18:48.688
- Speech, speech, speech.
- What? Come on, man.

18:48.764 --> 18:51.121
- All right.
- Let's do it.

18:51.773 --> 18:53.897
Thank you, Brad. Thank you all.

18:55.548 --> 19:00.296
Well, I'm humbled by your devotion
to celebrating my birthday. I mean...

19:02.429 --> 19:05.840
The other day Clyde was asking me
why I insist on no gifts...

19:05.917 --> 19:08.943
...and I said something about
how we don't need any more stuff.

19:09.020 --> 19:12.367
Which is true.
We don't need any more stuff, but...

19:13.437 --> 19:15.824
...I think what I really meant is...

19:15.900 --> 19:18.543
...you don't need to give me
anything because you're here.

19:18.620 --> 19:22.128
And that's a very good gift, I appreciate it.

19:23.068 --> 19:25.840
I mean, if you have, you know,
an albino alligator, I'll take it.

19:25.916 --> 19:28.016
- Don't worry about it.
- We do. I have one.

19:28.093 --> 19:31.132
Don't get me wrong. All right? But...

19:31.208 --> 19:35.376
...well, it just means everything
to me that we're here together.

19:35.452 --> 19:36.913
So...

19:38.140 --> 19:42.448
And to my lovely wife, Ramina...

19:43.005 --> 19:44.745
...without whom...

19:45.314 --> 19:48.016
- ...the hens would not be in the oven.
- Ah.

19:48.572 --> 19:51.631
- You did put them in, right?
- Yes. They're in.

19:51.708 --> 19:54.032
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

19:54.972 --> 19:57.439
- Where are we dancing this year?
- Ramina found the best place.

19:57.516 --> 20:01.023
- It's new and very hip.
- No bailing out.

20:04.380 --> 20:06.127
Oh, there you are.

20:06.828 --> 20:09.641
I want you to meet the birthday boy.

20:09.718 --> 20:11.760
Tom, this is Alice Manning.

20:11.836 --> 20:13.782
Nice to meet you.

20:14.397 --> 20:17.362
- Alice? Alice?
- She's amazing.

20:19.612 --> 20:20.976
You're the biologist?

20:21.053 --> 20:24.977
Yeah, she just got off the boat
from Australia. Tasmania.

20:25.054 --> 20:27.376
- I've always wanted to visit Australia.
- Really?

20:27.472 --> 20:31.128
I was actually gonna ask, it's like
the craziest surfing in the world, right?

20:31.205 --> 20:33.840
- I mean, do you surf?
- Everybody surfs down there, yeah.

20:33.916 --> 20:37.844
Wait a minute. You're not from Australia
though. I mean, you don't have an accent.

20:37.920 --> 20:40.862
- No, originally I'm from Denver.
- Oh.

20:40.938 --> 20:43.727
- Tom, you didn't toast Ramina.
- What?

20:43.804 --> 20:46.576
That's such great news.
We're so excited for you.

20:46.652 --> 20:48.771
What's the great news?

20:48.848 --> 20:52.816
California. Oh... Ramina just got into this
amazing jewelry program in San Diego.

20:52.893 --> 20:54.447
- Oh.
- Yes.

20:54.524 --> 20:56.048
Really?

20:56.700 --> 20:58.455
Congratulations.

20:59.325 --> 21:03.549
- Thank you.
- Wow. Why didn't you say anything?

21:05.212 --> 21:06.678
Eh.

21:07.164 --> 21:09.903
I'm sure Tom just did not
want to jinx things.

21:09.980 --> 21:11.088
- There you go.
- Right, Tom?

21:11.164 --> 21:12.720
- That's it.
- Who wants a drink?

21:12.797 --> 21:14.603
Awkward me, please.

21:14.679 --> 21:17.265
Hey, Mark.
What are you in the mood for, buddy?

21:17.342 --> 21:19.726
- Bourbon.
- Well, happy birthday.

21:20.911 --> 21:22.512
We take boat rides along the glades.

21:22.589 --> 21:25.775
The alligators are literally feet from you
and they follow the boat.

21:25.852 --> 21:28.432
- My goodness.
- So, Alice, how did you meet Clyde?

21:28.509 --> 21:31.248
Oh, we frequent the same lunch spot.

21:31.324 --> 21:33.840
- In Long Island?
- I'm in Midtown part of the week.

21:33.917 --> 21:37.199
Turns out Clyde and I both studied
at Carnegie Mellon. Isn't that wild?

21:37.276 --> 21:38.799
- Music?
- Biology.

21:38.876 --> 21:42.288
She discovered a new species of frog.
Play him the recording, you have to hear this.

21:42.365 --> 21:44.592
No, no. Really. Once in an evening is enough.

21:44.668 --> 21:47.280
So, when did you go to Carnegie Mellon,
before or after Clyde?

21:47.357 --> 21:51.920
- Hey. It's not polite to ask a lady's age.
- Did I ask her age? Did I ask your age?

21:51.997 --> 21:54.330
- After.
- Okay. So, how old are you?

21:54.407 --> 21:56.535
Definitely not polite.

21:57.117 --> 21:59.855
- What's going on?
- Tom's just giving Alice the third degree.

21:59.932 --> 22:03.088
- Yes. I love your home, Tom.
- Oh, thanks.

22:03.165 --> 22:05.871
Tom and his brother, Brad,
actually they grew up here.

22:05.948 --> 22:06.831
- Really?
- Yeah.

22:06.908 --> 22:10.895
Well, my parents live in London now
so Ramina and I are sort of house-sitting.

22:10.972 --> 22:12.847
Huh. Lucky guys.

22:12.924 --> 22:15.727
Brad and Sharon, they own their own
place in the West Village.

22:15.804 --> 22:17.552
Hedge fund.

22:17.629 --> 22:21.872
Must be strange, though, living
in the same house you grew up in.

22:21.948 --> 22:25.264
I don't know. I mean, sometimes.

22:25.724 --> 22:27.465
Would you like a tour?

22:29.372 --> 22:32.559
Sure. Can I ask you what that is over there?

22:32.636 --> 22:35.586
- What?
- Up here.

22:35.854 --> 22:39.792
- I don't know. That's all my father's stuff.
- Hold on a minute, can I stand on this?

22:39.869 --> 22:43.386
Oh. This is a fossil. Is this real?

22:43.462 --> 22:47.952
- I don't know. It's my father's.
- Oh, Late Cretaceous.

22:48.028 --> 22:51.248
You know what this is?
This is a two-legged snake.

22:51.325 --> 22:54.831
You see, see the vertebrae?
Those are the legs.

22:54.908 --> 22:58.352
Isn't that amazing? Yeah, they
were discovered in South America.

22:58.428 --> 23:01.423
- This is 80 or 90 million years old.
- Back when snakes had legs.

23:01.500 --> 23:04.848
I thought Dad brought that back
when he was teaching in Nairobi?

23:05.308 --> 23:08.335
Well, they would have been all over.
They would have been in East Africa...

23:08.412 --> 23:10.608
- ...South America.
- She's right, that's beautiful.

23:10.685 --> 23:13.103
- Did you know that was up there?
- No, I had no idea.

23:13.180 --> 23:16.304
You know, this should be
where people can see it.

23:16.381 --> 23:19.856
- Put it where someone can see it.
- You got it.

23:21.084 --> 23:23.139
Yeah, I think... should we eat?

23:23.216 --> 23:25.743
- Yes.
- Yes, I'm starving.

23:25.819 --> 23:28.559
- Time for salad.
- Yeah.

23:28.636 --> 23:30.097
Jennie?

23:30.941 --> 23:32.784
- It's... it's...
- Want a drink?

23:32.861 --> 23:34.831
- I'm starving. Yeah.
- Great.

23:34.908 --> 23:38.928
- Does Ramina have assigned seats for us...
- What? No. Just sit wherever.

23:39.004 --> 23:40.975
Tom, will you grab
the salad dressing, please?

23:41.052 --> 23:42.703
- Sure.
- Clyde, I want you to sit there.

23:42.780 --> 23:46.895
- And Alice, you come sit next to me.
- No. Goddamn it.

23:46.972 --> 23:49.104
Clyde, come here.

23:49.564 --> 23:52.495
- Tom, will you grab the bread also?
- Sure thing.

23:53.596 --> 23:54.960
So, how did you meet her?

23:55.037 --> 23:57.199
Why didn't you tell me
that Ramina got in to San Diego?

23:57.276 --> 24:01.168
I don't know. I... We still need
to work out what we're gonna do.

24:01.244 --> 24:02.384
You think?

24:02.460 --> 24:05.424
Well, I told her I needed
to discuss it with you.

24:05.501 --> 24:07.184
You make it sound like
you need my permission.

24:07.260 --> 24:10.703
- I don't need your permission. I just...
- Is this you quitting?

24:10.780 --> 24:12.301
No.

24:14.140 --> 24:16.591
I don't know. I mean, maybe...

24:16.668 --> 24:20.848
...I can take a leave for part of it or
maybe we do long distance for part of it.

24:20.925 --> 24:22.710
I don't know.

24:24.444 --> 24:28.305
Oh, my God. Right. 'Cause that's what you
guys need is time apart from each other.

24:29.628 --> 24:32.756
- Actually...
- What?

24:34.588 --> 24:36.912
So, how did you meet her again?

24:38.044 --> 24:39.887
In the cafeteria.

24:39.964 --> 24:43.408
The cafeteria? So, she works in our building?

24:43.484 --> 24:46.447
No, her... her lab
has an office across the street.

24:46.524 --> 24:48.279
She likes the food.

24:49.436 --> 24:52.719
- Huh. What do you know about her?
- What kind of question is that?

24:53.148 --> 24:55.345
Are you going out?

24:56.668 --> 24:59.248
She's made it clear that she just
wants friends in her life right now...

24:59.325 --> 25:01.661
...so I'm being her friend. But...

25:02.121 --> 25:04.858
...actually she's the first woman
that I've meet since Lisa that I like...

25:04.935 --> 25:07.087
...if you care.

25:07.164 --> 25:08.976
No, that's great.

25:09.148 --> 25:12.654
- Don't sound so thrilled.
- Tom, salad dressing.

25:13.948 --> 25:17.231
- Who's Tony?
- Don't ask.

25:17.308 --> 25:19.285
It's a whole saga.

25:20.892 --> 25:23.311
- Alice, red or white?
- What? Red, please.

25:23.388 --> 25:26.191
Four hundred applied. They accepted 12.

25:26.268 --> 25:27.407
- Wow.
- That's awesome.

25:27.484 --> 25:29.871
- We're so thrilled for you, Ramina.
- Thank you.

25:29.948 --> 25:32.902
Well, it's two years of course work,
metalsmithing, gemology...

25:33.074 --> 25:35.407
...computer rendering, it's everything.

25:35.484 --> 25:37.424
- Wow.
- Wow, that's awesome.

25:38.812 --> 25:41.680
I would like to propose a toast.

25:41.757 --> 25:44.846
- Don't touch my knobs.
- Don't touch my knobs?

25:45.420 --> 25:47.215
He gave this speech at their wedding where...

25:47.292 --> 25:49.683
- As I was saying.
- All right, all right.

25:50.780 --> 25:53.904
Now, I've known Ramina for a long time.

25:54.364 --> 25:58.689
And I can tell you stories of her
terrorizing the boys of our neighborhood.

25:59.324 --> 26:04.095
But I won't. I'll just say that
she has always been remarkable.

26:05.020 --> 26:10.096
But I look at her now
and she is becoming herself.

26:10.461 --> 26:12.431
She has become an artist.

26:12.508 --> 26:14.351
Well, I like how that sounds.

26:14.428 --> 26:16.177
Say it again.

26:17.021 --> 26:21.461
Your work is beautiful. And it makes
the people who are wearing it beautiful.

26:21.948 --> 26:25.424
And, Tom, you have encouraged her to do this.

26:25.500 --> 26:29.618
And I am grateful. I am overjoyed.

26:29.695 --> 26:31.660
- So, cheers.
- Cheers.

26:31.737 --> 26:33.808
- Cheers. Congratulations.
- Cheers.

26:33.884 --> 26:37.040
- And also, don't touch my knobs.
- There it is.

26:37.116 --> 26:38.896
Can't help it.

26:40.028 --> 26:42.191
Tom, I hear you had a victory
of your own at work.

26:42.268 --> 26:44.495
What? No. It's just something I wrote.

26:44.572 --> 26:47.664
- No. He's being modest.
- What was it?

26:48.412 --> 26:52.431
Well, we're helping formulate
part of this land reform bill.

26:52.508 --> 26:56.614
But we've been struggling for six months with
the Cattle Growers Association, they've...

26:56.691 --> 27:00.944
Cattle growers? Is that the word
in English? You grow cattle?

27:01.020 --> 27:04.219
That's the technical term.
Yeah. So, anyway...

27:04.295 --> 27:08.217
...I finally managed to frame it in a way
where hopefully we'll get some traction.

27:08.294 --> 27:10.447
- You should've read this email.
- It was an email?

27:10.523 --> 27:13.216
- It was a very masterful email.
- Not email.

27:13.293 --> 27:16.400
Email makes it sound like emails.

27:16.477 --> 27:18.159
- Correspondence.
- There you go.

27:18.236 --> 27:21.231
It's a set of guidelines that can
be inserted into the legislation.

27:21.308 --> 27:24.719
I wish I could still have red wine.
Now suddenly it gives me a headache.

27:24.796 --> 27:28.367
Oh, I know, it's the tannins.
I have a friend who has that.

27:28.444 --> 27:30.767
I cannot drink red wine,
I am completely allergic to it.

27:30.844 --> 27:33.260
- Oh, my God. This friend of ours, Danny...
- If they don't respond...

27:33.375 --> 27:35.598
...I swear I'm gonna dump them as clients.

27:35.676 --> 27:39.920
The work goes before the legislative
committee for discussion in September.

27:39.997 --> 27:42.319
All of a sudden, he starts sneezing.
Can't stop.

27:42.396 --> 27:45.902
Goes to the doctor and the doctor says
he's developing an allergy to the cats.

27:45.979 --> 27:48.003
- I know.
- Developing an allergy?

27:48.079 --> 27:50.960
- We don't know. That's what he said.
- No, apparently it can happen.

27:51.037 --> 27:53.104
Anybody need a cat?

27:53.181 --> 27:56.719
- Or ten? Ten?
- I don't buy it. I don't buy it.

27:56.796 --> 27:58.960
- What don't you buy?
- That you develop allergies.

27:59.036 --> 28:03.074
- I mean, maybe they're dormant, but...
- She's a scientist, she ought to know.

28:03.151 --> 28:06.671
Well, it depends.
Some you're born with, some you develop.

28:06.748 --> 28:08.832
I just hope I don't develop
an allergy to wine.

28:08.909 --> 28:11.311
That or chocolate. Kill me now.

28:11.388 --> 28:13.968
Can I get an allergy
to cucumbers, I hate cucumbers.

28:14.044 --> 28:16.911
No, you can't pick what you're allergic to.

28:17.275 --> 28:19.024
It was hypothetical.

28:19.484 --> 28:21.488
What if they made us allergic to things?

28:21.564 --> 28:23.887
- Like cigarettes.
- Or cell phones.

28:23.964 --> 28:27.119
Or just technology in general.
You could just go off the grid.

28:27.196 --> 28:29.392
- Well, I know someone who did that.
- Yeah?

28:29.469 --> 28:31.183
Can you imagine just leaving
everything behind?

28:31.260 --> 28:34.415
- You can't do that anymore.
- Sounds like being an immigrant.

28:34.492 --> 28:36.464
Or like life after divorce.

28:37.212 --> 28:41.012
I bet that some people
just run off to Tasmania.

28:42.492 --> 28:44.080
I'm sorry?

28:44.156 --> 28:46.192
I bet some people just run off to Tasmania.

28:46.268 --> 28:48.751
Oh. No, not that I met.

28:48.828 --> 28:52.087
Well, what about you? Where would you go?

28:52.924 --> 28:56.367
- I'd go to Mexico.
- Mexico is hardly off the grid.

28:56.444 --> 28:59.631
No. It was when I went. I went in
college and I almost never came back.

28:59.708 --> 29:01.986
- Like Butch Cassidy.
- That was Bolivia, baby.

29:02.063 --> 29:04.879
- And it did not end well.
- That's why you didn't finish CMU?

29:04.956 --> 29:09.775
Yeah, I dropped out completely.
I changed my name, everything. Mm-hmm.

29:09.852 --> 29:11.377
Why?

29:12.251 --> 29:14.065
Just sort of happened.

29:14.492 --> 29:18.624
I was on a bus to Guatemala and I got into
a conversation with this girl in Spanish...

29:18.701 --> 29:22.543
...and she asked me my name
and I told her my Spanish name.

29:22.620 --> 29:25.071
- Your Spanish name?
- Like in Spanish class?

29:25.148 --> 29:26.587
I was Marco.

29:26.972 --> 29:30.034
Well, my parents named me Jennifer
which doesn't exist in Spanish...

29:30.111 --> 29:32.879
...so my teacher decided I'd be Consuelo.

29:32.956 --> 29:35.631
- That's random, Consuelo?
- What was wrong with Jennifer?

29:35.708 --> 29:37.551
I just hated the name Jennifer.

29:37.628 --> 29:41.519
Anyway, after we got off the bus, she
invited me to stay with her and her family.

29:41.596 --> 29:46.095
And then they started asking me questions
about myself but by then I was Consuelo.

29:46.172 --> 29:49.676
So, I made her up.

29:50.012 --> 29:51.151
- Fun.
- Wow.

29:51.228 --> 29:54.256
What, lying to people
who took you in on complete trust?

29:54.332 --> 29:57.199
- How long were traveling?
- Eighteen months.

29:57.276 --> 29:59.183
Wait, you went 18 months as Consuelo?

29:59.260 --> 30:02.607
- Mm-hmm.
- I love that. That's amazing.

30:02.684 --> 30:05.072
When I was finally coming home, I...

30:05.532 --> 30:09.570
...I was watching the guy stamp my
passport and I had this feeling like...

30:09.647 --> 30:12.175
...I'm not the person
in that passport anymore.

30:12.252 --> 30:14.604
I'm Consuelo.

30:16.380 --> 30:18.895
So, Alice is the American name for Consuelo?

30:18.972 --> 30:21.551
Your mother must have been
a little insulted, no?

30:21.627 --> 30:23.150
We weren't exactly close.

30:23.227 --> 30:27.567
So, you got home and told your friends
to start calling you Alice?

30:27.644 --> 30:31.183
Actually, no, I never went home.
I went to Portland.

30:31.260 --> 30:34.095
- You never went home?
- Oh, my goodness.

30:34.172 --> 30:36.399
Wait, so you just completely left?

30:36.475 --> 30:39.218
Yeah, you know, listen,
I was practically a kid when I did this.

30:39.295 --> 30:43.092
- It was a really long time ago.
- Sure.

30:43.168 --> 30:46.798
So, I'm sorry, but you haven't
seen your family since?

30:46.875 --> 30:49.039
Or anyone else you knew?

30:49.115 --> 30:51.823
Do they have any idea what happened to you?

30:51.900 --> 30:53.584
No.

30:54.172 --> 30:57.198
- I think it sounds amazing.
- Me, too.

30:57.290 --> 31:00.208
- That's... brave.
- Yeah.

31:01.339 --> 31:03.159
Cheers, Alice.

31:08.476 --> 31:12.494
I mean, really, Clyde, I am impressed.
She is wonderful.

31:12.571 --> 31:15.950
Yeah, I can't say I exactly knew. But, yeah.

31:16.027 --> 31:18.227
- How is she wonderful?
- What do you mean how?

31:18.304 --> 31:22.926
I mean, she's beautiful, exciting,
adventurous. She is a keeper.

31:23.003 --> 31:26.603
How does walking out on everyone
in your life make someone a "keeper"?

31:26.680 --> 31:28.014
Pay no attention to him.

31:28.091 --> 31:32.043
So, if you stick with something or someone
you're basically not adventurous?

31:32.120 --> 31:34.286
I don't think I'm quite ready
to propose to her yet.

31:34.363 --> 31:36.814
But you need a woman who knows
how to wipe the table clean.

31:36.891 --> 31:40.623
That's not even the expression.
You know... oh. Never mind.

31:41.083 --> 31:43.663
- Ugh.
- Well, I like her, Clyde.

31:43.740 --> 31:46.321
- I approve.
- Thank you.

31:48.315 --> 31:51.695
I love my Spanish name,
you should call me Marco.

31:51.771 --> 31:53.871
I don't see you as a Marco.

31:53.948 --> 31:56.110
Marco would be so much fun, right?

32:16.348 --> 32:18.868
- It's a beautiful deck.
- Jennie.

32:20.539 --> 32:23.056
Jennie, come on, it's you. Right?

32:26.171 --> 32:27.918
This is crazy.

32:29.563 --> 32:31.533
You're alive.

32:32.123 --> 32:33.551
Yeah.

32:33.628 --> 32:36.598
- Thought I was dead?
- I didn't know.

32:39.563 --> 32:42.720
I mean, where... where'd you go? To Mexico?

32:43.372 --> 32:45.759
What difference does it make where I went?

32:45.835 --> 32:49.407
Oh. Good point. So, you didn't go
to Mexico, it's just a story.

32:49.484 --> 32:51.871
And you're from Denver all of a sudden?

32:51.947 --> 32:53.823
It's part of who I am now.

32:54.284 --> 32:58.707
You're kidding. Please, tell me
you're kidding. What is this?

33:00.299 --> 33:04.351
You know what?
Actually, don't even bother. Okay?

33:04.715 --> 33:07.487
Just do me a favor,
I don't especially wanna explain this...

33:07.563 --> 33:10.495
...to my wife and my friends.

33:11.051 --> 33:14.015
- What the hell?
- I wanted to see you.

33:14.092 --> 33:16.479
Jennie, it's been 15 years.

33:16.843 --> 33:19.646
- Yeah.
- I'm married.

33:20.203 --> 33:23.359
I mean, why didn't you just
pick up the phone and call me?

33:23.436 --> 33:27.070
Say what, "Hi, this is Jennie,
only I'm not really Jennie anymore."

33:27.147 --> 33:28.994
Do you understand?

33:29.071 --> 33:33.342
Your parents showed up at my door.
Your father was bawling his eyes out.

33:33.419 --> 33:36.222
Begging me to tell him where you were.

33:36.299 --> 33:39.988
- They had no idea what happened...
- I let them know I was alive.

33:42.475 --> 33:44.223
But you didn't see them?

33:44.587 --> 33:47.125
Or was that just a story too?

33:49.131 --> 33:50.947
I went to Canton.

33:52.715 --> 33:54.688
Couldn't get out of the car.

33:58.508 --> 34:01.268
My dad died two years ago of a heart attack.

34:03.179 --> 34:04.670
So...

34:15.083 --> 34:16.902
What do you want?

34:19.563 --> 34:21.312
Tom?

34:21.964 --> 34:24.163
You guys ready for cake?

34:24.619 --> 34:28.286
Yeah. Yeah, sure. Let's... let's do cake.

34:36.824 --> 34:39.518
So, in other words it's my fault
for making you binge?

34:39.596 --> 34:41.534
No, I'm saying maybe
that's the reason she decided...

34:41.612 --> 34:44.159
...she needed to get the fuck away
from everybody for a while.

34:44.235 --> 34:49.150
I thought step one was accepting that
it is a disease. That it doesn't go away.

34:49.226 --> 34:52.190
Actually, that's not step one.
At all. People can still change.

34:52.268 --> 34:53.951
Their behavior maybe, but not who they are.

34:54.027 --> 34:56.286
At least people still recognize
that they have room to improve.

34:56.364 --> 34:58.719
Yeah, I think everyone wants
to be a better person.

34:58.796 --> 35:01.599
This is not about improvement.
This is about running away.

35:01.676 --> 35:03.647
I wouldn't call it that.

35:03.723 --> 35:06.168
I'm sorry, what would you call it?

35:06.571 --> 35:08.382
Making a change.

35:08.459 --> 35:11.295
Right, but wherever you go there you are.
Isn't that what they say?

35:11.372 --> 35:14.585
I think that's what people tell themselves
when they don't have the courage to change.

35:14.662 --> 35:18.655
What about you, Tom?
Maybe you can take up surfing in California?

35:18.731 --> 35:21.599
- Grow a beard?
- Tom's not going anywhere.

35:21.676 --> 35:23.967
- What?
- That's not exactly what I said, Clyde.

35:24.082 --> 35:25.375
- Really?
- What does that mean?

35:25.451 --> 35:27.774
- It's complicated.
- Why is it complicated?

35:27.851 --> 35:30.718
Look, I don't really wanna
talk about it right now. Okay?

35:30.795 --> 35:32.746
Is he really saying he doesn't want to go?

35:33.451 --> 35:36.126
- Idiot.
- I am not an idiot, thank you.

35:36.203 --> 35:39.092
- Wait, seriously, what's going on, Ramina?
- You don't want her to go?

35:39.169 --> 35:42.015
No. I'm the one who pushed her
to... Jesus Christ.

35:42.092 --> 35:44.383
Is this about your committee
meeting in September?

35:44.460 --> 35:48.479
- You can find someone else to do that, no?
- No, it's not. We're figuring it out, okay?

35:48.556 --> 35:52.574
Maybe she can go by herself.

35:52.651 --> 35:55.039
- Ramina?
- It'd probably be better.

35:55.115 --> 35:57.791
- He'd just ruin it, anyway.
- For two years?

35:57.868 --> 36:01.081
Look, can we be permitted
to figure this out privately?

36:01.157 --> 36:05.393
Not at my birthday party. Thanks.

36:09.291 --> 36:11.596
The candles are melting.

36:12.076 --> 36:13.823
Who's Tony?

36:13.931 --> 36:16.484
Oh, my God. You weren't kidding.
That's amaz...

36:21.804 --> 36:25.341
Okay. I guess we're not
singing "Happy Birthday"?

36:26.923 --> 36:29.663
I bet they didn't have cakes
like that during the potato famine.

36:29.740 --> 36:31.487
The potato famine?

36:32.715 --> 36:36.830
- Inside joke.
- Oh. No, actually...

36:37.547 --> 36:39.615
...aren't we going dancing?

36:39.692 --> 36:42.175
Oh, yeah, I think maybe...

36:42.251 --> 36:45.790
No. No, no, no. Don't even think about it.

37:21.003 --> 37:22.787
That's wild whiskey.

37:33.452 --> 37:37.480
- Let's do this.
- Yeah. I'll be... I'll be over in a minute.

38:20.652 --> 38:23.044
Excuse me, can I get an Old Fashioned?

38:24.267 --> 38:26.245
I thought you wanted to dance?

38:47.884 --> 38:49.698
Wanna see something?

38:54.700 --> 38:56.452
Watch the olive.

39:02.411 --> 39:03.935
Hey.

39:04.012 --> 39:05.790
What are you guys up to?

39:20.107 --> 39:21.883
There you are.

39:24.012 --> 39:26.022
She's good with the olives.

39:32.939 --> 39:35.871
- Where did you learn to do that?
- I used to let a guy saw me in half.

39:35.948 --> 39:37.150
You did not.

39:37.227 --> 39:40.862
When I was 28 I toured China
for a year as a magician's assistant.

39:42.283 --> 39:44.926
- What? A magician's assistant?
- That's awesome.

39:45.003 --> 39:47.839
You said you lived in
a Tasmanian marsh from the age of 24.

39:47.916 --> 39:52.351
- No, that was Consuelo.
- No, I saw a picture. I mean...

39:53.003 --> 39:56.159
Right? Why did you just say
that you were in China?

39:56.715 --> 39:59.262
I was in China before I was in Tasmania.

39:59.339 --> 40:02.248
- Are you sure?
- So, were you really a magician?

40:02.324 --> 40:06.431
- Do you really study frogs?
- Jesus, did you make all of that up?

40:06.987 --> 40:09.375
Were you actually in Tasmania?

40:10.763 --> 40:11.710
Yes.

40:11.787 --> 40:13.598
How do we know that you're telling the truth?

40:13.675 --> 40:16.415
Well, how do I know anything
that you've said tonight is true?

40:16.491 --> 40:18.943
Because they all know me
and you're a pathological liar.

40:19.019 --> 40:22.398
- You're under complete false pretenses.
- All right, Sharon.

40:22.475 --> 40:24.926
- Just calm down.
- Why are you defending her?

40:40.331 --> 40:42.464
- What is going on?
- I don't even know her.

40:42.541 --> 40:46.017
Jesus, Ramina. Back off. Okay?

40:47.691 --> 40:49.439
Unbelievable.

40:50.379 --> 40:51.995
Well, it was nice to meet you.

40:54.346 --> 40:56.092
Happy birthday.

40:57.867 --> 40:59.934
Where are you going?

41:00.011 --> 41:02.980
Look, I'm sorry, Clyde.
But that was horrible.

41:03.563 --> 41:06.974
- Clyde, I am so sorry.
- No, I am sorry. I had no idea.

41:07.051 --> 41:11.356
- I'd say you dodged a bullet, buddy.
- Okay, excuse me. I need some air.

41:17.611 --> 41:19.136
Jennie.

41:19.787 --> 41:22.207
Jennie. Jennie.

41:22.283 --> 41:24.670
Oh, I'm sorry. Should I call you Consuelo?

41:24.747 --> 41:29.048
Is that it? Hey, come on.
You completely disappeared for 15 years...

41:29.125 --> 41:32.689
...and then you show up, tell this crazy
story, turn around, and run out the door.

41:34.507 --> 41:39.091
Have you actually been to Tasmania?
Or Australia? Or China?

41:39.168 --> 41:42.846
Yes, yes. I was in China, Hong Kong,
and Singapore for 11 months.

41:42.923 --> 41:44.255
You're making all this shit up.

41:44.332 --> 41:47.455
Why'd you follow me out here,
to call me a liar?

41:48.939 --> 41:50.912
I came out here...

41:52.108 --> 41:54.462
...because you were about to run off...

41:55.336 --> 41:56.832
...again.

42:11.531 --> 42:13.727
You don't understand the feeling.

42:16.587 --> 42:18.270
I went to Portland.

42:18.347 --> 42:22.607
And in Portland I was
a whole other person. And...

42:27.691 --> 42:29.893
<i>I felt reborn.</i>

42:35.787 --> 42:40.371
<i>But then after a while
it started to feel too familiar.</i>

42:42.571 --> 42:45.889
<i>And I realized, I could just step out of it.</i>

42:47.851 --> 42:50.049
<i>I could just start again.</i>

42:54.315 --> 42:56.448
<i>It was like I had this skill.</i>

43:01.035 --> 43:02.812
<i>This power.</i>

43:06.315 --> 43:08.452
<i>I could be anyone I wanted.</i>

43:10.347 --> 43:13.278
<i>And I could do it again and again.</i>

43:15.243 --> 43:17.405
<i>I could live a thousand lives.</i>

43:21.707 --> 43:25.378
<i>And every time it was like
she'd always existed.</i>

43:27.563 --> 43:29.764
<i>She had her own history.</i>

43:34.155 --> 43:37.058
<i>And I keep filling her in.</i>

44:01.131 --> 44:04.005
<i>Until she felt finished.</i>

44:20.523 --> 44:22.497
<i>Ready to move on.</i>

44:45.771 --> 44:49.069
<i>I feel free to let go.</i>

44:55.685 --> 44:57.375
<i>There's this moment...</i>

44:58.411 --> 45:00.261
<i>...when you're a blank slate.</i>

45:13.867 --> 45:16.940
<i>It's like a high.</i>

45:19.819 --> 45:23.936
<i>And you're deciding what next.</i>

45:39.819 --> 45:41.262
So...

45:42.024 --> 45:44.959
- ...how many times have you done it?
- Nine.

45:45.419 --> 45:49.118
Jesus. Did you rob some banks along the way?

45:49.195 --> 45:50.846
It's not like that.

45:50.923 --> 45:54.878
Oh, so you just get off on deceiving people,
and playing master of disguise.

45:54.955 --> 45:57.660
- That's not what it is.
- Oh, yeah?

46:00.971 --> 46:03.487
So, what are you doing here, Jennie?

46:04.907 --> 46:06.910
I wanted to see you.

46:10.059 --> 46:13.822
You were the last person
who really knew me before I left.

46:13.899 --> 46:16.033
And I needed to see someone...

46:19.051 --> 46:21.019
...who knew me.

46:24.779 --> 46:28.062
Yeah, but... that doesn't mean...

46:28.138 --> 46:30.238
Hey! Hey! Easy, boy, easy.

46:30.324 --> 46:32.512
- Quiet. Quiet.
- Easy, boy.

46:32.588 --> 46:35.966
You'd never know he was trained.
Be nice, Jimbo.

46:36.043 --> 46:39.749
Look at you. Are you out for a late walk?

46:39.825 --> 46:43.230
Say, "I insisted.
Wouldn't take no for an answer."

46:43.307 --> 46:45.246
Aw, he's great.

46:45.322 --> 46:48.990
- You guys been to the new club?
- Aw, you must hate the noise.

46:49.067 --> 46:53.150
Well, actually, I dragged my husband
there a couple weeks ago.

46:53.227 --> 46:57.215
I wanted to see what they'd done
with the place. It's not too bad.

46:57.291 --> 47:00.222
Beats what we had there before,
one of those weird climbing walls.

47:00.299 --> 47:03.294
Oh, I love those walls. You ever try it?

47:03.371 --> 47:05.377
Well, once.

47:05.454 --> 47:07.966
Yep, you look like the adventurous type.

47:08.043 --> 47:09.358
- Do I?
- Yep.

47:09.435 --> 47:12.766
Well, that's nice to hear.
Two years in the Peace Corps.

47:12.843 --> 47:15.134
Last of the hippies.

47:15.211 --> 47:19.198
You got everything you need?
Let's go see Roger. All right.

47:19.562 --> 47:23.099
- You guys enjoy your night.
- Good night.

47:27.499 --> 47:30.456
Jimbo, drop it. Stop it.

47:30.955 --> 47:32.899
- Ow.
- Oh!

47:33.611 --> 47:37.124
- You all right? Hey. Hey.
- You okay?

47:37.707 --> 47:40.798
Here, take my hand. Take my arm.

47:40.971 --> 47:43.551
Ooh. Ow, my damn feet.

47:44.843 --> 47:48.351
- You okay?
- No. I don't think so.

47:48.427 --> 47:50.462
Use the ball of your foot.

47:50.539 --> 47:54.398
- How far are you?
- Oh, God. I'm just around the corner.

47:54.475 --> 47:56.293
Well, we'll help you.

47:58.059 --> 47:59.873
Come on.

48:00.491 --> 48:04.606
Yep, probably a sprain.
Need to elevate it. Put ice on it.

48:04.683 --> 48:08.255
- You sound like you know.
- Yeah, well, years of medical training.

48:08.331 --> 48:11.790
Lucky for me. What kind of doctor are you?

48:12.907 --> 48:15.677
Cardiologist, heart surgeon.

48:15.754 --> 48:16.994
Children.

48:18.219 --> 48:20.766
Ooh, jeez, how did you choose that?

48:20.843 --> 48:22.686
Just in it for the money.

48:22.763 --> 48:26.081
Yeah. Right. You seem like the type.

48:26.158 --> 48:30.494
My parents were both doctors.
My brother's a doctor.

48:30.570 --> 48:33.579
Me, I couldn't stand the sight of blood.

48:33.867 --> 48:36.254
My mom took me into surgery
when I was a kid...

48:36.330 --> 48:40.061
...and I almost fainted
as soon as the knife went it.

48:40.138 --> 48:43.678
It was an act of will
to force myself back up.

48:43.754 --> 48:47.134
- From then on I was determined.
- Oh.

48:47.211 --> 48:48.989
I'm a secretary.

48:49.706 --> 48:51.838
Thirty-eight years.

48:51.915 --> 48:54.110
I retire next year.

48:54.187 --> 48:57.214
- Well, congratulations.
- Yeah. What am I supposed to do?

48:57.290 --> 48:59.454
Wind that gold watch they give me?

49:00.490 --> 49:02.642
You're good, I can tell.

49:02.718 --> 49:05.630
I don't understand how some doctors
can be so awkward.

49:05.707 --> 49:07.869
Yeah, she's got a real way with people.

49:07.946 --> 49:10.076
Oh, home sweet home.

49:13.035 --> 49:16.252
Yeah. Oh, he's dying to go in.

49:16.329 --> 49:19.389
- It's okay, I got him. I got him.
- Let me get... let me get my keys out.

49:19.466 --> 49:21.283
Hang on a minute.

49:21.994 --> 49:24.734
Move over, Jimbo. I gotta get in here.

49:24.811 --> 49:27.550
- There just hold on to the...
- Oh, dear.

49:27.627 --> 49:29.054
- Is it upstairs?
- In there.

49:29.130 --> 49:30.845
- Second floor.
- Second floor?

49:30.922 --> 49:32.894
- Do you mind?
- No, not at all. Let's do it.

49:32.970 --> 49:35.676
- Okay.
- Let's do it.

49:36.523 --> 49:38.063
Go on, Jimbo.

49:38.140 --> 49:40.637
- Wait a minute, Jimbo. Hold up.
- No, no, no, can you get it?

49:40.810 --> 49:42.558
Hold on to the banister there.

49:42.635 --> 49:44.450
I got it.

49:48.523 --> 49:50.340
There you go.

49:53.195 --> 49:54.493
Oh.

49:54.570 --> 49:56.958
- What's the matter with you?
- I fell.

49:57.035 --> 50:00.448
- These nice folks helped me home.
- Why were you walking him?

50:00.525 --> 50:03.304
- I told you I was gonna to do it.
- He needed to go.

50:03.381 --> 50:05.950
- Didn't you see him pacing around?
- How 'bout the couch, huh?

50:06.027 --> 50:08.093
- Thank you.
- No problem.

50:08.170 --> 50:10.973
She's a doctor. Can you believe that?

50:11.050 --> 50:14.365
- Thank you. I'm Roger, this is Nina.
- Hello, Roger. Nice to meet you.

50:14.442 --> 50:16.125
- I'm Alice.
- Thank you, doctor.

50:16.202 --> 50:18.270
- This is Tony.
- Tony? Okay.

50:18.346 --> 50:21.725
She needs to elevate it
and stay off it for a day or two.

50:21.802 --> 50:23.966
Can you get it higher?

50:24.938 --> 50:27.006
Here. And it should be iced.

50:27.082 --> 50:30.013
- Tony? In the freezer.
- Yep.

50:30.090 --> 50:31.612
Mm-hmm.

50:37.034 --> 50:41.469
The plastic bags
are in the cabinet over the sink.

50:47.050 --> 50:49.758
She doesn't listen, she doesn't think.

50:49.835 --> 50:53.149
- Stubborn, stubborn, stubborn, stubborn.
- Yeah, look who's talking.

50:53.706 --> 50:57.022
Roger, move those books
so she can sit down. And the mail.

50:57.098 --> 51:00.835
Oh, my ankle's gonna swell up
like a balloon, I can tell.

51:04.747 --> 51:06.590
Here you go.

51:06.667 --> 51:10.590
You might wanna let Tony
take a look, he's the osteopath.

51:12.632 --> 51:14.429
What... what are the chances?

51:14.698 --> 51:16.675
Of course. Go ahead.

51:21.483 --> 51:25.150
She has osteoporosis and arthritis both.

51:25.611 --> 51:28.925
Which is why she shouldn't be
walking the dog.

51:30.378 --> 51:32.324
What's your specialty?

51:33.354 --> 51:37.150
Sports. Sports Medicine mostly.
Neck injuries.

51:37.226 --> 51:39.614
- He used to treat Andre Agassi.
- No kidding?

51:39.690 --> 51:43.023
- Mm-hmm.
- Once. She exaggerates.

51:43.851 --> 51:45.854
You could take my sock off.

51:46.218 --> 51:47.685
Okay.

51:48.299 --> 51:50.078
Where do you practice?

51:50.634 --> 51:52.541
In New York Presbyterian.

51:52.618 --> 51:54.909
That's where my brother had
his kidney transplant.

51:54.986 --> 51:57.437
- Oh, really?
- What was Albert's doctor's name?

51:57.514 --> 52:01.629
- You think I remember?
- It's something, something...

52:01.706 --> 52:03.070
Ah! I think it's Fenworth.

52:03.146 --> 52:06.462
I don't really interact
with that department. But...

52:07.306 --> 52:10.450
I'm guilty. I love being a doctor.

52:11.754 --> 52:13.149
Yeah.

52:13.226 --> 52:15.214
So, let's take a look.

52:15.531 --> 52:17.566
Oh, I'm a mess.

52:17.642 --> 52:19.390
- Hold on.
- Aren't we all?

52:19.466 --> 52:21.885
It's worst in the morning when I get up.

52:21.962 --> 52:25.118
I have to take a Tylenol first thing
or walking's a misery.

52:25.195 --> 52:27.582
Oh, I'm sure, I'm sure. Uh...

52:27.659 --> 52:30.718
On a scale of a one to ten, on average...

52:30.795 --> 52:33.630
...how would you rate the pain,
ten being the worst.

52:33.706 --> 52:35.358
Seven.

52:35.434 --> 52:37.597
Better than an eight.

52:37.674 --> 52:39.632
Here, use these.

52:41.099 --> 52:44.031
Sure. Thank you. Uh...

52:45.738 --> 52:49.117
- How long have you had the problem?
- About a year?

52:49.194 --> 52:50.653
Right.

52:50.730 --> 52:53.633
I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis.

52:55.755 --> 52:58.238
Rheumatoid arthritis, yes.

52:58.314 --> 53:00.861
It's actually an autoimmune disorder.

53:01.322 --> 53:05.182
The immune system attacks
the linings of the joints.

53:05.450 --> 53:08.949
Tends to show up symmetrically
on the right and left sides.

53:09.482 --> 53:11.838
Mornings are always gonna be bad, I know.

53:11.914 --> 53:14.366
You have to do
your flexibility exercises every day.

53:14.442 --> 53:17.309
- Yeah, I know.
- See, that's what the doc said.

53:17.386 --> 53:21.424
Yeah. It sounds so much nicer
the way he says it.

53:22.266 --> 53:23.831
He's good.

53:23.908 --> 53:28.338
You better get good or they'll
have to amputate. Right, doc?

53:29.483 --> 53:31.163
Mm-hmm.

53:32.778 --> 53:35.710
No, that shouldn't be necessary.

53:36.075 --> 53:38.782
You'll have to excuse his sense of humor.

53:38.955 --> 53:40.959
Oh, you got me.

53:41.995 --> 53:45.950
- So, how's the ankle feeling now?
- It's comfortable. Comfortably numb.

53:46.026 --> 53:49.374
- Perfect.
- We certainly appreciate your help.

53:49.450 --> 53:52.988
I don't know what she would have done
if you hadn't dusted her off.

53:54.890 --> 53:56.828
You two are cute.

53:57.546 --> 53:59.547
How did you meet?

53:59.946 --> 54:01.406
Us?

54:03.690 --> 54:05.662
We met at a party.

54:06.314 --> 54:08.894
He made a beeline right to me.

54:10.091 --> 54:14.847
His college was across town from mine
and I used to sneak into the parties.

54:14.923 --> 54:17.476
Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's right.

54:18.058 --> 54:22.301
It was three weeks before she told me
she wasn't even a student there.

54:22.378 --> 54:26.686
Yeah. I was totally in awe of him.

54:27.242 --> 54:30.397
He was the first person
I ever fell in love with.

54:30.474 --> 54:33.277
Then he sat me down
for the "just friends" conversation.

54:33.354 --> 54:36.664
Oh, yeah. Big speech about the future.
How he didn't see us...

54:36.741 --> 54:38.717
...what was it? Uh...

54:38.794 --> 54:42.687
"Together down the road."
That's about right, isn't it?

54:43.978 --> 54:46.492
So, then what happened?

54:47.562 --> 54:49.308
She disappeared.

54:49.834 --> 54:53.055
- It wasn't because of you.
- Really?

54:53.930 --> 54:57.150
Anyway, it wouldn't have worked out.
He was far too wrapped up in himself.

54:57.227 --> 54:59.166
I needed something else.

54:59.626 --> 55:02.365
Now, how did you two end up together?

55:02.442 --> 55:04.445
Oh, we're not together.

55:04.714 --> 55:08.062
- Wait, you're not a couple?
- Oh, no. No, we're friends.

55:08.139 --> 55:10.686
He has a lovely wife named Ramina.

55:10.954 --> 55:13.085
- Huh.
- Here.

55:13.162 --> 55:16.093
Something, by the way of thanks.

55:16.170 --> 55:18.748
It's grilled goat meat.

55:18.825 --> 55:20.416
Eat.

55:22.762 --> 55:26.173
- Thanks.
- It's not bad for the cholesterol.

55:26.250 --> 55:30.142
- You should tell your patients.
- It's a Haitian specialty.

55:30.698 --> 55:32.541
I will let them know.

55:32.618 --> 55:34.269
All right.

55:34.346 --> 55:37.885
We slaughtered her in a special ritual...

55:37.962 --> 55:41.504
...so eating her flesh makes you blessed.

55:45.418 --> 55:47.198
Stop it.

55:48.042 --> 55:50.269
They're gonna think you're serious.

55:50.346 --> 55:52.317
He didn't take me serious.

55:55.178 --> 55:57.597
You didn't think I was serious, did you?

55:57.674 --> 56:00.510
Not spicy enough.
He never makes it spicy enough.

56:00.587 --> 56:03.838
I had her one year...
one year in Port-au-Prince...

56:03.914 --> 56:05.885
...and she thinks she's more Haitian than me.

56:05.962 --> 56:07.278
It's delicious.

56:07.354 --> 56:10.237
- Have some more.
- Ah, it's all right.

56:10.314 --> 56:13.092
Well, I'm sure they want
to get on with their evening.

56:13.610 --> 56:16.093
I, actually, before you go...

56:16.841 --> 56:19.006
...is there a chance you could
take a look at something?

56:19.083 --> 56:21.752
Oh, what? Roger, no.

56:21.828 --> 56:25.527
- Mm-mm.
- He's here. Okay? Why not?

56:26.794 --> 56:31.427
Her back has been bothering her
because of the osteoporosis.

56:32.298 --> 56:33.780
Could you take a look?

56:34.858 --> 56:37.758
- At her back?
- You don't mind?

56:38.506 --> 56:41.757
- Sure. No problem.
- Just a little peak.

56:41.834 --> 56:43.741
- Oh, Roger.
- I've got you.

56:43.818 --> 56:46.174
- And if the good doctor has you.
- Help me.

56:46.250 --> 56:49.032
I don't know, I was planning
on sleeping here all night.

56:50.154 --> 56:53.636
It's chronic. My mother had the same thing.

56:57.514 --> 56:59.214
There you go.

56:59.290 --> 57:01.023
Mm-hmm.

57:07.530 --> 57:09.026
Mm-hmm.

57:21.962 --> 57:23.708
Go ahead.

57:39.242 --> 57:40.413
- Tom?
- Yeah.

57:40.490 --> 57:45.095
Maybe we should head off.
You've got that patient who keeps calling.

57:46.058 --> 57:48.032
Right, yeah.

57:53.098 --> 57:56.606
Wow, I was completely absorbed.

57:57.738 --> 57:59.748
Yeah, it's hard to stop.

58:02.538 --> 58:05.646
Remember when we went to go
visit your parents? And...

58:05.723 --> 58:08.909
...we had to stay at that motel
afterwards? You got so sick.

58:08.986 --> 58:12.382
- You took care of me.
- Well, you were burning up.

58:12.458 --> 58:14.941
I had to keep getting ice
from the ice machine all night.

58:15.018 --> 58:17.469
- It kept eating your quarters.
- Yeah.

58:17.546 --> 58:22.205
Oh, and there was that... that weird woman
at the front desk when we checked out.

58:22.570 --> 58:24.318
She kept...

58:31.530 --> 58:33.981
- Her wheezing.
- Yes, yeah.

58:34.058 --> 58:36.221
Oh, my God, I forgot about her.

58:36.298 --> 58:37.789
Yeah.

58:41.258 --> 58:43.009
Hey, you know...

58:45.609 --> 58:47.582
I'm sorry about your dad.

58:50.282 --> 58:52.289
He was a really great guy.

58:53.418 --> 58:54.781
Yeah.

58:54.858 --> 58:56.608
He was.

59:07.978 --> 59:10.492
Did you think I'd run off and killed myself?

59:12.554 --> 59:16.443
Well, you said, some pretty
extreme things about your life.

59:17.578 --> 59:20.542
Well, things were pretty extreme.

59:21.194 --> 59:25.533
Look, I didn't want to be responsible
for you leaving school.

59:25.610 --> 59:27.771
You were supposed to have this whole life.

59:30.314 --> 59:32.324
Yeah, right.

59:34.250 --> 59:37.822
You know, they used to lock the building
on Sundays to make us stop practicing...

59:37.898 --> 59:40.477
...and get out of those tiny piano studios.

59:41.705 --> 59:44.669
You know, I didn't know
what to do with myself, I...

59:44.938 --> 59:48.430
...I went across town and I remember seeing
the list of all the different departments...

59:48.507 --> 59:51.803
...you guys had.
I mean, you could study anything.

59:54.314 --> 59:58.203
You looked at me so differently
when I told you the truth about...

59:59.114 --> 01:00:00.864
I was impressed.

01:00:02.186 --> 01:00:05.277
- I liked who you were.
- No, you liked the idea of who I was.

01:00:05.354 --> 01:00:08.286
You liked the incredible piano prodigy.

01:00:10.858 --> 01:00:12.317
Anyway...

01:00:12.778 --> 01:00:14.781
You weren't the reason I disappeared.

01:00:14.858 --> 01:00:17.917
I mean, you didn't help.
You were pretty fucking shitty in fact.

01:00:17.994 --> 01:00:20.637
I mean, that speech you gave me about...

01:00:20.714 --> 01:00:24.784
- Yeah, yeah, I know, about being on a path.
- Being on a path? God.

01:00:30.922 --> 01:00:35.322
Look, I was jealous. I mean,
you already seemed so driven. And I...

01:00:40.394 --> 01:00:43.332
I mean, you know what I do for a living?

01:00:45.002 --> 01:00:47.198
Basically, I write emails.

01:00:49.226 --> 01:00:51.699
I've spent the last 13 years...

01:00:51.776 --> 01:00:54.848
...suggesting guidelines.

01:00:57.866 --> 01:01:00.771
Which honestly, I get almost nothing out of.

01:01:02.537 --> 01:01:06.141
Almost, which is, in a way,
worse than nothing...

01:01:06.218 --> 01:01:10.142
...because you think if you just hold on...

01:01:10.218 --> 01:01:13.053
...and shift one little thing...

01:01:13.130 --> 01:01:14.946
...you can...

01:01:21.162 --> 01:01:22.910
I feel like...

01:01:27.690 --> 01:01:29.694
...you know, if I leave...

01:01:30.633 --> 01:01:32.794
...basically, I've failed.

01:01:38.378 --> 01:01:41.673
Mm, anyway, what else
am I gonna do, sell insurance?

01:01:42.474 --> 01:01:44.238
I sold insurance.

01:01:45.513 --> 01:01:47.581
Mm? Oh, really?

01:01:47.657 --> 01:01:49.412
Yeah, fuck you.

01:01:55.433 --> 01:01:58.547
So, it's not a coincidence
you're in New York...

01:01:59.334 --> 01:02:01.149
...is it?

01:02:01.226 --> 01:02:04.547
I mean, did you invent Alice
just so you could...

01:02:05.642 --> 01:02:07.396
...see me?

01:02:11.082 --> 01:02:13.085
And all the rest of it.

01:02:13.833 --> 01:02:17.374
You just made it up,
all the studying frogs...

01:02:21.834 --> 01:02:23.354
No.

01:02:23.754 --> 01:02:25.504
It's real.

01:02:28.713 --> 01:02:30.698
Show me.

01:02:31.082 --> 01:02:33.250
Show me, I wanna see...

01:02:33.806 --> 01:02:35.774
...who you are now.

01:03:55.690 --> 01:03:58.000
- Knock, knock.
- Alice, hey.

01:03:58.076 --> 01:04:02.961
Hey. James, this is Tom.
Tom, James. We trade night shifts.

01:04:03.037 --> 01:04:05.497
Nice to meet you. I thought
you weren't back in until Tuesday?

01:04:05.574 --> 01:04:07.837
I'm not. Tom's an old friend just visiting...

01:04:07.914 --> 01:04:11.165
...and I told him he has to hear the frogs
sing before he leaves in the morning.

01:04:11.242 --> 01:04:14.525
Definitely. Hey, C-group's hatching.

01:04:14.601 --> 01:04:16.731
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

01:04:21.386 --> 01:04:23.396
Will you give me a minute?

01:09:01.417 --> 01:09:03.100
Thanks.

01:09:04.746 --> 01:09:06.500
Thank you.

01:09:13.993 --> 01:09:15.523
So...

01:09:20.233 --> 01:09:21.858
...so, what's next?

01:09:24.393 --> 01:09:28.729
Now that you've seen me,
you just... become someone else?

01:09:35.560 --> 01:09:37.568
I wanna see how you do it.

01:09:40.618 --> 01:09:42.085
Leaving.

01:12:34.505 --> 01:12:36.638
This is... huh.

01:12:37.578 --> 01:12:40.515
I mean, they're all so totally different.

01:12:44.521 --> 01:12:45.979
Yeah.

01:12:47.178 --> 01:12:48.954
Were you married?

01:12:49.929 --> 01:12:52.701
No. Not married.

01:12:56.361 --> 01:12:58.589
How do you even keep track of them all?

01:13:02.825 --> 01:13:04.346
Well...

01:13:08.905 --> 01:13:12.226
...this is Mae, China.

01:13:13.961 --> 01:13:16.738
- Cut in two.
- Mm-hmm.

01:13:18.313 --> 01:13:19.808
Vanessa.

01:13:20.649 --> 01:13:22.461
South Africa.

01:13:26.505 --> 01:13:27.971
Sasha.

01:13:30.665 --> 01:13:32.412
She was the last one.

01:13:39.626 --> 01:13:41.949
Keeping track isn't the hard part.

01:13:43.081 --> 01:13:45.400
It's when everyone around you...

01:13:46.633 --> 01:13:48.604
...thinks they know who you are...

01:13:48.681 --> 01:13:51.326
...and they try to lay claim to you and...

01:13:58.505 --> 01:14:00.248
...then you're trapped.

01:14:03.369 --> 01:14:05.146
That's the hard part.

01:14:07.081 --> 01:14:08.836
So stop doing it.

01:14:22.985 --> 01:14:24.771
And be who?

01:14:29.193 --> 01:14:31.010
Hmm.

01:14:36.105 --> 01:14:39.019
I still remember watching you
practice, you know.

01:14:40.265 --> 01:14:44.385
There was this one time you were working
on a passage, it was Brahms, I think...

01:14:46.345 --> 01:14:48.317
...and you just wouldn't stop.

01:14:48.873 --> 01:14:52.143
Just over and over and over. You were so...

01:14:53.065 --> 01:14:54.815
...determined.

01:14:56.681 --> 01:14:59.006
To just master it, you know?

01:15:04.297 --> 01:15:06.107
You're still doing it.

01:15:09.545 --> 01:15:12.749
I mean, that's what
all this is, right? It's all you.

01:15:13.449 --> 01:15:15.228
All of them.

01:15:17.769 --> 01:15:19.535
And it's...

01:15:19.614 --> 01:15:22.306
...crazy and fucked up and...

01:15:24.777 --> 01:15:27.169
...it's also kind of amazing.

01:15:40.905 --> 01:15:42.654
Wanna come with me?

01:16:08.265 --> 01:16:10.077
Time to go.

01:16:17.481 --> 01:16:19.229
Ah, shit.

01:17:02.569 --> 01:17:04.573
So, where next?

01:17:05.321 --> 01:17:07.133
You should go now.

01:17:13.065 --> 01:17:15.964
Wait, you mean, you just want me
to leave you here?

01:17:24.905 --> 01:17:26.915
Mm, okay.

01:17:31.529 --> 01:17:34.567
Well, see you in another 15 years maybe.

01:17:38.633 --> 01:17:40.161
Maybe.

01:18:14.632 --> 01:18:16.387
It was good to see you again.

01:18:20.296 --> 01:18:22.082
Thank you.

01:18:30.953 --> 01:18:32.700
Take care of yourself.

01:18:36.489 --> 01:18:38.876
You know where to find me, I guess.

01:20:31.081 --> 01:20:32.862
I've been thinking...

01:20:34.281 --> 01:20:36.790
...about California and...

01:21:03.337 --> 01:21:06.993
<i>Attention please,
this is the final call for flight...</i>

01:21:09.416 --> 01:21:11.421
<i>...to Amsterdam.</i>

01:21:11.977 --> 01:21:15.890
<i>Departing passengers should proceed
to gate 52 for final boarding.</i>
