02:10.529 --> 02:12.567
- Hey, Emily.
- Hey.

02:12.738 --> 02:14.776
Where you been, stranger?
Long time no see.

02:14.948 --> 02:16.489
So many of my credits
didn't transfer.

02:16.657 --> 02:19.146
They've got me taking
sophomore make-up classes.

02:19.325 --> 02:20.652
What you been up to?

02:20.826 --> 02:23.778
Seems like l've been spending
all my time on the West Beverly Blaze.

02:23.995 --> 02:25.951
l know. l've been reading.

02:26.955 --> 02:29.658
Listen, l'd like to walk you out
but l gotta go meet Bren.

02:29.873 --> 02:32.789
She's taking her driver's test
again today, for the third time.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.327
What's her problem, anyway?

02:35.418 --> 02:37.125
Parallel parking.

02:37.336 --> 02:40.454
And we practise and practise
but she just doesn't get it.

02:44.465 --> 02:47.630
l am just so freaked out
about hitting one of those cones again.

02:47.800 --> 02:48.962
You won't.

02:49.134 --> 02:50.876
You know l had this dream
last night

02:51.052 --> 02:54.501
where l was taking my driver's test.
Only l was driving this 1 8-wheeler,

02:54.679 --> 02:58.342
which l had to parallel park in between
these gigantic orange cones

02:58.515 --> 03:01.847
that were filled with explosives.
And if l hit one, l was dead.

03:02.017 --> 03:03.179
What happened?

03:03.351 --> 03:06.635
Well, l woke up in a cold sweat.
l couldn't fall asleep for over an hour.

03:06.811 --> 03:07.889
Poor Brenda.

03:08.062 --> 03:09.721
Didn't you guys used
to have nightmares

03:09.896 --> 03:11.603
about taking your driver's test?

03:11.814 --> 03:14.434
God, no.
l passed with flying colours.

03:14.607 --> 03:16.148
l think some people
were born to drive.

03:16.358 --> 03:18.230
l mean, l think it's in my genes.

03:18.401 --> 03:21.069
Oh, please. You should have seen
Kelly when she got her licence.

03:21.236 --> 03:23.772
For the first month,
l felt like a crash-test dummy.

03:23.946 --> 03:25.984
So l had a few fender-benders.

03:26.197 --> 03:29.280
- lt's how you learn.
- All right, Bren. You ready?

03:29.449 --> 03:31.820
- Yeah. Where's Dylan?
- l saw him at lunch,

03:31.992 --> 03:34.067
he said he'd meet us out front.

03:36.578 --> 03:38.201
Go on. You can do it.

03:56.840 --> 03:58.582
How am l doing so far?

03:58.758 --> 04:00.216
So far so good.

04:01.426 --> 04:03.548
This is the easy part.

04:10.223 --> 04:14.219
Pull forward and parallel park
between the orange cones.

04:18.394 --> 04:19.887
Come on, Bren.

04:22.564 --> 04:24.057
Now parallel park.

04:24.857 --> 04:27.144
l blow this every time.

04:30.568 --> 04:34.777
With your eyes open,
visualise the vehicle in the space.

04:35.654 --> 04:38.523
Trust your hands on the wheel.

04:38.906 --> 04:42.652
Be like a snake
slithering across the ground.

04:43.826 --> 04:45.533
A snake.

04:58.543 --> 05:00.333
- Yes.
- Hey. Oh, oh.

05:00.752 --> 05:01.949
Am l in?

05:02.378 --> 05:05.330
Proceed to the entrance.
You've passed your test.

05:05.547 --> 05:07.206
Oh, thanks.

05:09.424 --> 05:11.546
So then it was time
to parallel park.

05:11.759 --> 05:14.083
And in that brief moment,
my entire future life

05:14.260 --> 05:17.378
without a licence flashed before me
and it was horrible.

05:17.554 --> 05:19.960
And l knew l could not
and would not fail.

05:20.139 --> 05:21.715
Ah, that's great, sweetheart.

05:21.890 --> 05:25.138
Friday l'll make a big dinner. We'll
have your friends over to celebrate.

05:25.350 --> 05:26.629
Thanks, Mom.

05:26.809 --> 05:30.223
Now, one question still remains.

05:30.395 --> 05:32.600
Dad, since you did help
Brandon buy his car,

05:32.813 --> 05:34.520
l assume that we're
going to share it.

05:34.689 --> 05:36.929
Survey says:

05:37.107 --> 05:40.225
Sorry, Brenda, the correct answer is,
''Dad did not help me buy my car.

05:40.442 --> 05:42.350
He merely helped me repair it.''

05:42.568 --> 05:45.022
Brandon,
l can't totally be without wheels.

05:45.695 --> 05:47.153
l'll get it.

05:47.363 --> 05:49.319
Hey, if you want a car, get a job.

05:49.489 --> 05:52.654
- That's the American way.
- Brandon, l don't think it's up to you.

05:52.866 --> 05:55.190
Does this
have to be decided tonight?

05:55.367 --> 05:57.607
Bobby, what a surprise.

05:58.744 --> 05:59.941
You are? That's wonderful.

06:02.580 --> 06:05.248
Oh, well, sure.
Sure, of course you can.

06:05.415 --> 06:07.406
Hey! Yo, Bobster!

06:08.250 --> 06:12.080
Okay, great. Talk to you then.
Bye-bye.

06:13.128 --> 06:16.744
- So did he call to congratulate me?
- No.

06:16.922 --> 06:19.246
He called to say
he wants to come visit this weekend.

06:19.423 --> 06:20.833
He did, really? That's great.

06:21.841 --> 06:24.330
He's thinking of transferring
to UCLA.

06:25.802 --> 06:27.959
You're kidding?
Bobby might move here?

06:29.471 --> 06:31.012
Don't we need to discuss details?

06:31.430 --> 06:32.757
Well, of course.

06:36.183 --> 06:38.507
lt'll be great to see Bobby,
it's been so long.

06:46.856 --> 06:49.725
Tell me more about this
college-aged cousin of yours.

06:49.899 --> 06:51.522
ls he available?

06:51.692 --> 06:53.482
Yes and no.

06:53.651 --> 06:55.477
Kelly, he's really not your type.

06:55.694 --> 06:57.068
What's that supposed to mean?

06:57.278 --> 06:58.605
Nothing.

06:58.946 --> 07:02.278
Wait a second. ls he that guy
in the picture over your fireplace?

07:02.448 --> 07:04.819
That gorgeous stud wearing
that little red bathing suit?

07:04.991 --> 07:06.982
Kelly, control yourself.

07:09.577 --> 07:11.485
Don't you ever feel
like we just abandoned Bobby

07:11.662 --> 07:13.321
once we left Minnesota?

07:13.496 --> 07:15.618
l got the feeling
we abandoned a lot of people.

07:16.414 --> 07:18.156
You know what l mean.

07:18.332 --> 07:20.407
He cried when we left.

07:20.584 --> 07:22.042
He did?

07:22.210 --> 07:24.995
Well, that's what mom said
Aunt Marjorie told her.

07:25.170 --> 07:28.122
Well, l'm sure he'd be thrilled
to know that you heard that.

07:28.963 --> 07:31.001
lt just feels so weird
growing up with someone

07:31.173 --> 07:33.841
and then having them
completely disappear out of your life.

07:45.014 --> 07:47.764
Hey, hey, hey.

07:49.517 --> 07:51.841
Wait a minute.
What's going on here?

07:52.019 --> 07:54.176
You shooting hoops
or breaking windshields?

07:54.353 --> 07:58.052
Hey, hey, hey, talk to your dad. He's
the one with the height advantage,

07:58.230 --> 07:59.604
still can't make a decent shot.

07:59.815 --> 08:01.189
- Hey, hey.
- He wanted to give me

08:01.357 --> 08:03.811
an eight-point handicap,
l said, forget it, enough's enough.

08:03.984 --> 08:06.473
- Not true.
- How you doing, buddy?

08:06.652 --> 08:08.442
Long time no see.
l missed you, man.

08:09.654 --> 08:11.480
Oh, come on,
don't give me that crap.

08:11.655 --> 08:14.144
How can you miss anything
living in this place?

08:15.074 --> 08:16.152
Oh, my God.

08:16.658 --> 08:17.985
Brenda, you look so gorgeous.

08:19.785 --> 08:21.776
l'm not just saying it this time.

08:22.328 --> 08:23.904
She's a real woman.

08:24.079 --> 08:26.699
Bobby, stop it. You know that
you are worse than ever.

08:26.914 --> 08:28.822
l'm telling you,
if we weren't first cousins...

08:28.998 --> 08:30.740
You know, why didn't
you ever write me back?

08:30.916 --> 08:33.619
l must've written you at least
a dozen letters since we moved here.

08:33.793 --> 08:36.792
- l sent some postcards.
- Two.

08:36.961 --> 08:38.668
That's the wonderful thing
about family.

08:38.837 --> 08:41.669
l couldn't get this kind of abuse
staying in a hotel.

08:42.548 --> 08:44.919
Take over for me, son.
l've gotta go wash up. Good luck.

08:45.091 --> 08:46.833
Thanks.

08:47.009 --> 08:51.336
- Oh, l am so glad you're here.
- More, please.

08:51.511 --> 08:55.838
Come on, Walsh, let's see what a year
of easy living has done to you.

08:56.014 --> 08:59.760
- Come on.
- Yeah.

09:01.476 --> 09:05.222
So it doesn't seem like your brain's
been totally fried by the sun out here.

09:05.394 --> 09:06.852
What did you expect?

09:07.020 --> 09:09.142
Well, l thought that
every other word would be like,

09:09.438 --> 09:11.809
''Hey, dude, like, let's all catch
some totally, full-on

09:11.982 --> 09:14.104
gnarly radical waves.''

09:14.692 --> 09:16.434
No, l don't surf.

09:16.609 --> 09:18.435
l tried,

09:19.319 --> 09:20.777
but it didn't work out that well.

09:21.195 --> 09:23.519
You can bet if l lived out here
and l still had my legs,

09:23.697 --> 09:25.688
l'd be surfing my little buns off.

09:26.115 --> 09:29.067
Yeah, well, you always could
pick up any sport.

09:29.242 --> 09:34.198
So how is the female situation?

09:35.704 --> 09:37.576
lt's happening.

09:38.330 --> 09:40.998
There's this one girl, Emily.

09:41.957 --> 09:45.454
And we went out once
and things got a little weird.

09:46.877 --> 09:48.500
Then heat fizzled.

09:48.670 --> 09:52.962
Come on, don't let weird
get in the way. Seize the day.

09:53.422 --> 09:55.876
Yeah, we'll see.

09:56.549 --> 09:59.418
l'm looking forward to meeting
some California babes, myself.

09:59.593 --> 10:01.631
Ah, so the truth finally comes out.

10:01.802 --> 10:04.470
The real reason you wanna go
to UCLA is for the ladies.

10:04.679 --> 10:07.347
l just don't wanna miss out
on anything, Brandon.

10:07.514 --> 10:09.671
Yeah, sure.

10:10.766 --> 10:12.389
l understand.

10:17.561 --> 10:19.636
You know, Bobby,

10:21.605 --> 10:24.355
since your accident...

10:25.649 --> 10:29.775
Listen, Brandon, it's been a long trip.

10:31.820 --> 10:33.977
l gotta get some Z's.

10:35.197 --> 10:38.196
Yeah, sure.

10:39.824 --> 10:41.447
Hit the light on your way out,
will you?

10:41.825 --> 10:43.104
Yeah.

10:50.414 --> 10:51.741
Good night.

10:52.373 --> 10:53.914
Good night.

10:57.460 --> 10:59.202
What are the ramifications

10:59.377 --> 11:02.542
of Bobby attending
UCLA next semester?

11:03.380 --> 11:04.707
l don't know.

11:04.881 --> 11:06.339
Well, isn't this something

11:06.506 --> 11:08.793
you should be
talking with your brother about?

11:08.966 --> 11:11.716
Cindy, Allen put me up for two years
when l went to college.

11:11.885 --> 11:15.252
lt's just a big responsibility
for us to take on.

11:15.428 --> 11:19.470
And, of course, it's not one
that we're gonna turn our backs on.

11:19.973 --> 11:22.011
lt just seems so sudden.

11:22.182 --> 11:25.181
Allen says he's getting
pretty self-sufficient.

11:28.144 --> 11:33.977
l look at him and l think,
God, life is cruel and senseless.

11:35.023 --> 11:37.643
l mean, one minute,
he's this big strapping boy,

11:37.816 --> 11:40.484
can't sit still. And the next,

11:42.569 --> 11:44.311
he's a paraplegic.

11:46.113 --> 11:49.065
And l feel so bad for him.

11:49.948 --> 11:53.778
But more than that--
And this is what's driving me crazy.

11:56.869 --> 12:01.410
--what l feel most
is this gigantic sense of relief.

12:02.706 --> 12:03.950
Why?

12:08.084 --> 12:11.036
Because it's not Brandon
sitting in that wheelchair.

12:13.337 --> 12:15.245
And it could have been.

12:16.589 --> 12:18.415
Just as easily.

12:18.590 --> 12:20.249
lt could have been.

12:35.808 --> 12:40.183
Bobby, l don't believe it.
You did all this?

12:40.353 --> 12:43.388
No, little elves snuck in
and helped me during the night.

12:43.563 --> 12:45.638
Aunt Cindy, you act like
l'm crippled or something.

12:46.648 --> 12:48.888
- Silly me.
- Yeah, l was gonna squeeze

12:49.066 --> 12:51.223
some fresh OJ
but l couldn't find that contraption.

12:51.401 --> 12:53.357
Yeah, it's right up here.

12:54.152 --> 12:56.357
Slightly out of my reach.

12:56.779 --> 12:58.237
Oh, sorry about that.

12:58.446 --> 13:00.236
l can't believe what l'm smelling.

13:00.406 --> 13:02.113
Mom, this is so nice.

13:02.324 --> 13:04.446
Bobby, l don't want you
to get the wrong idea.

13:04.658 --> 13:07.408
This is definitely not your typical
morning at the Walsh house.

13:07.577 --> 13:09.367
Guys, l had nothing to do with this.

13:09.536 --> 13:10.946
This is all your cousin's work.

13:11.454 --> 13:12.947
Bobby, you fixed breakfast?

13:13.122 --> 13:16.536
Hey, remember when we all
used to go skiing together?

13:16.707 --> 13:19.623
Who'd be up at 6:30
in the morning scrambling eggs?

13:19.792 --> 13:21.285
You would.

13:22.085 --> 13:25.452
So who's gonna set the table?
This stuff isn't gonna stay hot forever.

13:25.629 --> 13:28.083
All right.
You heard the man, let's get cracking.

13:28.255 --> 13:30.661
- Brandon, that's your job.
- Get the silverware, Brenda.

13:30.840 --> 13:32.499
l think Brandon can do it.

13:32.675 --> 13:34.880
Seeing Bobby's put me
in a generous mood, Bren.

13:35.051 --> 13:36.959
l'm about to do something
totally crazy.

13:37.136 --> 13:40.005
- What?
- l'm gonna let you drive my 'Stang.

13:40.179 --> 13:42.336
Oh, do not do me any favours.

13:42.555 --> 13:44.712
Come on, how many people
get to break in their licence

13:44.890 --> 13:46.597
behind the wheel
of an American classic?

13:47.141 --> 13:48.634
Look, l'll take a pass.

13:48.851 --> 13:51.091
Brenda, you've had your licence
for two days now.

13:51.269 --> 13:52.513
What are you afraid of?

13:52.936 --> 13:55.935
Look, Brandon, l'll drive
when l have to drive. Until then,

13:56.105 --> 13:57.847
school, James.

13:58.023 --> 13:59.931
Attention, West Beverly drivers,

14:00.107 --> 14:02.561
the Beverly Hills High
charity car wash is this weekend.

14:02.734 --> 14:06.480
And now here's a little something
to get your morning started right.

14:16.492 --> 14:17.689
Hey, Donna.

14:17.868 --> 14:19.575
Hi.

14:19.744 --> 14:21.901
Listen, l know it's kind of short notice,

14:22.078 --> 14:24.449
but l was wondering
what you were doing tonight?

14:24.622 --> 14:26.697
Maybe we can go see a movie
or something.

14:26.873 --> 14:29.409
David, l'd love to, l would.

14:29.583 --> 14:31.705
But l'm going to this dinner
at Brenda's.

14:33.210 --> 14:35.332
Well, she can come too.

14:37.671 --> 14:39.164
l guess that wouldn't work, would it?

14:44.633 --> 14:46.708
Well, maybe we can do it
again sometime.

14:47.635 --> 14:49.875
Yeah, we'll see.

14:50.928 --> 14:52.042
Ciao.

14:52.221 --> 14:53.500
Bye.

14:53.680 --> 14:55.303
See you later.

14:58.475 --> 15:00.846
- Hey.
- Hi.

15:01.018 --> 15:03.638
- So, what time's dinner?
- Dinner?

15:03.853 --> 15:05.809
The big celebration dinner
you invited us all to

15:05.979 --> 15:07.258
when you got your licence?

15:08.689 --> 15:11.474
You know, with my cousin here,
l totally forgot.

15:12.107 --> 15:14.892
Bren, is it all right if l bring
David Silver tonight?

15:15.067 --> 15:16.774
Why?

15:16.944 --> 15:19.694
Because he asked me to a movie
but l'm having dinner with you guys.

15:20.112 --> 15:23.277
ls this a date?
Are we dating David Silver?

15:23.447 --> 15:28.153
- No, we're just friends, okay?
- Excuse me.

15:29.993 --> 15:32.233
l don't know.
lt might be too many people.

15:33.245 --> 15:34.987
No problem.

15:35.371 --> 15:38.204
So l finally get to meet
this dreamy cousin of yours.

15:38.373 --> 15:40.827
Kelly, there's something
that you should know about Bobby.

15:41.416 --> 15:43.870
He is cute and he is over 21 .

15:45.085 --> 15:47.621
But three years ago,
he got in an accident

15:47.795 --> 15:50.035
and now he's paralyzed
from the waist down.

15:51.380 --> 15:53.834
- Brenda, l'm sorry.
- Me too.

15:54.424 --> 15:56.795
Look, he doesn't need your pity.

15:56.967 --> 15:58.590
So if you're gonna act weird
around him,

15:58.760 --> 16:01.047
just-- Let's call the whole thing off
right now.

16:01.720 --> 16:03.261
Why would you even think that?

16:03.929 --> 16:06.928
Look, l just get a little overprotective
about him sometimes.

16:08.182 --> 16:11.596
He used to date a girlfriend of mine
back in Minnesota.

16:11.976 --> 16:14.512
And she dumped him
right after the accident.

16:19.563 --> 16:21.685
We should get to class.

16:24.775 --> 16:26.932
- Hey, sport.
- Hey, chief.

16:27.109 --> 16:29.100
So, what time's
the big dinner tonight?

16:29.277 --> 16:31.067
Ah, Brenda says 7.

16:31.237 --> 16:33.193
Do you think l could hitch a ride?

16:33.363 --> 16:35.354
Why don't you ask Bren?
She just got her licence.

16:35.531 --> 16:37.403
l don't think she's even
broken it in yet.

16:37.574 --> 16:41.819
Great. Maybe l'll just take the bus.

16:43.494 --> 16:45.035
Hi.

16:46.204 --> 16:47.483
Hey, Em.

16:48.288 --> 16:50.114
Hi, guys. Sorry l'm late.

16:50.289 --> 16:53.122
Late for what?
Since when do you take journalism?

16:53.625 --> 16:55.284
As of today.

16:55.459 --> 16:57.865
l was taking a psych class
but l was not cut out for it.

16:58.044 --> 17:00.166
So l figured l'd give
the family business a shot.

17:00.337 --> 17:01.747
Great.

17:02.088 --> 17:03.546
Your father must be so pleased.

17:04.131 --> 17:07.130
Maybe you should work
for one of his papers for real.

17:07.299 --> 17:08.709
No chance of that.

17:10.093 --> 17:12.962
So where should l start?

17:13.511 --> 17:17.008
You know, we could use
an extra body in Sports.

17:17.180 --> 17:20.713
- Sounds great.
- Sports can take care of itself.

17:21.307 --> 17:24.342
No, what we're lacking
is adequate coverage of the PTA.

17:24.518 --> 17:26.924
l mean, last Saturday,
they had a mother-daughter bake sale,

17:27.103 --> 17:28.762
we totally blew it.

17:29.812 --> 17:31.471
What do you say?

17:31.939 --> 17:33.053
You're the boss.

17:34.357 --> 17:35.980
Great.

17:39.401 --> 17:42.021
- Dylan on 8-foot net.
- Challenge, challenge. You got it, kid.

17:42.695 --> 17:44.402
Once, Bob.

17:45.196 --> 17:47.864
- Yes, yes. Bobby, nice shot.
- Who is this guy?

17:48.031 --> 17:49.857
- That's 1 4-1 2.
- Where were you?

17:50.783 --> 17:52.490
Hey, just watch
your own man, money.

17:52.659 --> 17:53.986
Nice shot.

17:54.452 --> 17:55.910
How long you been watching?

17:56.078 --> 17:58.153
Long enough to know
who's gonna win.

17:58.329 --> 18:01.613
Kelly, this is my cousin Bobby.
Bobby, this is Kelly.

18:03.165 --> 18:04.327
Nice to meet you.

18:04.499 --> 18:06.823
Bobby, Brenda and Brandon.
How cute.

18:07.001 --> 18:08.494
l know, it's disgusting, huh?

18:09.627 --> 18:11.749
So, Brenda tells me
you're applying to UCLA.

18:12.212 --> 18:14.832
- We'll see.
- Hi, guys, sorry we're late.

18:15.005 --> 18:17.245
But we had to pick up Andrea
and the traffic was killer.

18:17.423 --> 18:19.414
- Sorry.
- Brenda, you drove?

18:20.133 --> 18:21.792
No, Donna did.

18:21.968 --> 18:24.374
Brenda, isn't it about time
you put the pedal to the metal?

18:25.011 --> 18:27.086
Brandon, please leave me alone.

18:29.055 --> 18:30.085
- Kill. Kill.
- Shoot.

18:30.264 --> 18:31.342
- Blow away.
- Finger.

18:31.515 --> 18:34.799
Uh, gun. l got it. All right.

18:34.975 --> 18:36.598
First word.

18:40.437 --> 18:43.520
- l need a better hint.
- Shoulder gun.

18:43.689 --> 18:45.016
What is it?

18:45.231 --> 18:46.605
- Striptease.
- The Naked Gun.

18:46.815 --> 18:48.356
Yes.

18:49.234 --> 18:51.272
All right.

18:51.485 --> 18:53.311
l didn't know how far
l was gonna have to go.

18:53.486 --> 18:54.979
Kel, l was hoping
you'd pick that one.

18:58.030 --> 18:59.488
- Go.
- No.

18:59.656 --> 19:01.149
- Bren.
- Go, Bren.

19:01.324 --> 19:02.698
- Brenda.
- Go, Bren.

19:02.866 --> 19:05.438
- Come on, Brenda, just pick one.
- All right.

19:05.618 --> 19:06.696
Kelly, sit here.

19:07.494 --> 19:10.742
- Are you kidding, l'll crush you.
- Try me.

19:13.581 --> 19:15.288
Okay.

19:16.458 --> 19:18.117
All right.

19:21.294 --> 19:23.202
You're in good hands.

19:23.920 --> 19:25.876
l cannot believe this.
Who picked this?

19:26.047 --> 19:27.754
Who wrote this?

19:27.964 --> 19:29.836
Well, is it a TV show,
movie or book?

19:30.216 --> 19:32.670
Steve, you better pray
it's not a book.

19:35.219 --> 19:38.052
So we broke into the girl's bunk
at 3 a.m. and yelled, ''Rattler.''

19:38.220 --> 19:40.211
No, but first we put
the snake in the girl's bed.

19:40.388 --> 19:42.296
lt was just a little garden snake,
no big deal.

19:42.473 --> 19:44.381
- You should have heard her scream.
- Oh, man.

19:44.557 --> 19:47.889
- Remember?
- lt was the last summer we spent--

19:48.059 --> 19:51.011
- At Camp Kissemee Falls.
- At Camp Kissemee Falls.

19:51.186 --> 19:53.722
- Good nighty.
- Good nighty.

19:53.896 --> 19:57.310
Guys, l hate to be a drag
but l am beat.

19:57.732 --> 19:59.273
Yeah, me too.

19:59.441 --> 20:02.061
Well, go to sleep, then.
l'll put myself to bed, guys.

20:03.777 --> 20:06.776
- You sure?
- Absolutely. See you in the morning.

20:07.446 --> 20:09.354
Good night, pal.

20:09.530 --> 20:11.237
Good night, Bobby.

20:12.032 --> 20:13.988
Good night, Kelly.

20:14.158 --> 20:15.948
Night, Brenda.

20:19.786 --> 20:21.196
Mind if l join you?

20:23.622 --> 20:25.080
Can you?

20:25.248 --> 20:26.871
Can l?

20:32.085 --> 20:33.792
Sorry.

20:33.961 --> 20:35.869
Much more comfortable.

20:40.423 --> 20:42.414
So how long ago was it that--?

20:42.591 --> 20:45.507
Oh, three years, four months,
some odd days.

20:45.676 --> 20:47.383
Not that l'm counting.

20:48.428 --> 20:52.589
- Any chance of a--?
- Nope, but l'm lucky, though.

20:52.764 --> 20:54.423
lf the injury on my spine
was any higher,

20:54.598 --> 20:56.424
l'd be quadriplegic
instead of paraplegic.

20:56.891 --> 20:58.550
What's the difference?

20:58.725 --> 21:00.597
Well, one you're paralyzed
from the waist down

21:00.768 --> 21:02.142
and the other from the neck down,

21:02.311 --> 21:05.927
which means no wheelchair
basketball, among a lot of other things.

21:06.855 --> 21:09.142
l think it's great
how you handle it all, l mean.

21:09.357 --> 21:13.566
Man has a marvellous capacity,
not only to adapt to his surroundings,

21:13.734 --> 21:17.101
but to make his surroundings
adapt to him.

21:18.445 --> 21:20.650
l read that somewhere.

21:20.988 --> 21:22.647
But it's true.

21:25.658 --> 21:27.898
Hey, listen,
have you ever ridden a horse?

21:28.076 --> 21:29.984
Are you kidding?
l love to ride. Yeah.

21:30.160 --> 21:31.736
Really? l grew up on horses.

21:31.911 --> 21:33.819
Maybe we can look for a place
to ride tomorrow.

21:33.996 --> 21:36.367
l'm sure there's gotta be
some stables around here.

21:36.706 --> 21:38.578
You can still...?

21:38.790 --> 21:41.458
Kelly, l can still do a lot of things.

21:50.881 --> 21:54.213
Look, l'll see you tomorrow.

21:54.383 --> 21:56.255
l'd walk you out, but...

21:56.426 --> 21:58.298
That's okay.

21:58.468 --> 22:00.590
Sleep well.

22:09.183 --> 22:10.557
Good night.

22:25.901 --> 22:27.976
Brandon.

22:29.695 --> 22:33.228
Brandon, l feel really weird
about this whole Kelly-Bobby thing.

22:33.947 --> 22:36.615
What are you talking about,
Brenda?

22:36.782 --> 22:38.524
l'm not even up yet.

22:38.700 --> 22:41.368
She didn't leave
until after 1 this morning.

22:41.535 --> 22:44.238
What's the problem?
So they like each other.

22:44.412 --> 22:46.320
Yeah, well,
Kelly can be really flirtatious.

22:46.496 --> 22:48.404
So can Bobby.

22:48.956 --> 22:52.204
l just don't wanna see him
get hurt again, that's all.

22:53.084 --> 22:55.289
What are you saying?
That Kelly can't really like Bobby

22:55.460 --> 22:57.451
because he's in a wheelchair?

22:57.628 --> 22:59.038
Maybe.

22:59.712 --> 23:02.581
Look, l don't know. l guess l just
wonder what his expectations are.

23:02.756 --> 23:05.921
Probably the same as any other guy
who likes a girl.

23:06.091 --> 23:08.841
He hopes that she likes him back.

23:10.218 --> 23:12.090
l know you're right.

23:12.261 --> 23:15.794
l'm probably making a bigger deal
out of it than it really is.

23:16.847 --> 23:19.515
Okay, okay.
No, as long as you got the saddle.

23:19.682 --> 23:21.472
Okay, 1 :00?

23:21.934 --> 23:23.213
Are we free at 1 :00?

23:23.643 --> 23:26.559
- Yeah, l guess so.
- Okay, 1 :00 is fine.

23:26.728 --> 23:29.976
- We'll see you then.
- What was that all about?

23:30.147 --> 23:34.059
Horseback riding.
You, me, Brenda, Dylan and Kelly.

23:34.232 --> 23:35.642
l want her to see me ride, Brandon.

23:35.817 --> 23:37.689
l don't think she believes
l can still do it.

23:37.901 --> 23:39.857
You kidding? After how
you were hitting on her

23:40.027 --> 23:41.520
she thinks you can walk on water.

23:41.945 --> 23:43.521
Too strong?

23:43.696 --> 23:46.529
Listen, Bobby.
l know Kelly pretty well,

23:46.698 --> 23:49.318
and l just wouldn't want you
to misunderstand anything here.

23:50.117 --> 23:52.155
Like what?
You think she's patronizing me?

23:53.994 --> 23:55.156
Let me tell you something,

23:55.370 --> 23:58.239
that was not a patronizing kiss
l got before she left last night.

23:59.164 --> 24:01.369
Just go slow, that's all l'm saying.

24:01.748 --> 24:03.905
Tell me what you're really thinking,
Brandon.

24:04.083 --> 24:06.205
You don't think that Kelly
could be serious

24:06.376 --> 24:07.999
about some guy in a wheelchair.

24:14.631 --> 24:16.539
There we go.

24:18.300 --> 24:20.624
Be careful with the family jewels,
boys.

24:21.843 --> 24:24.795
- What's this horse's name?
- Shane.

24:24.970 --> 24:27.008
Now, how's that feel?

24:27.180 --> 24:29.551
Feel like l got me four legs.

24:30.348 --> 24:33.881
All right, see what you can do,
Shane.

24:34.476 --> 24:37.475
- Whoa, look at him go.
- Hey, wait up.

24:37.644 --> 24:38.806
Come on, baby.

24:40.187 --> 24:42.593
Come on, Bren.

24:46.066 --> 24:48.638
- So, what's her name?
- Spitfire.

24:48.817 --> 24:53.192
Don't you have any named
Gentle Jim, anything like that?

24:53.487 --> 24:55.478
Ah, she's gentle.

24:55.655 --> 24:58.227
As long as you stay
on her good side.

25:06.369 --> 25:08.360
Bobby, slow down.

25:09.413 --> 25:10.610
Come on, pokey.

25:35.595 --> 25:38.547
Slow down. Hold it. Hold it.

25:43.599 --> 25:45.258
l love this.

25:45.434 --> 25:48.517
This is my version
of a seeing-eye dog.

25:49.102 --> 25:52.018
Yeah, like a walking-legs horse.

25:52.188 --> 25:53.895
Exactly.

25:55.106 --> 25:57.181
So listen, there's a party tonight.

25:57.357 --> 26:00.689
Mostly high school kids,
might be a little young for you.

26:02.027 --> 26:05.441
No problem.
As long as you're gonna be there.

26:06.404 --> 26:10.186
Yeah, me, Brenda, Brandon,
Steve, Donna, Dylan.

26:10.365 --> 26:11.775
The gang.

26:11.949 --> 26:13.442
The gang.

26:23.789 --> 26:26.492
Hey, hey, guys, hey.

26:28.625 --> 26:30.782
We gotta get back,
our time's almost up.

26:30.960 --> 26:32.619
Thank God.

26:33.628 --> 26:36.461
l'll see you guys back--
Hey, hey, hey.

26:42.800 --> 26:43.914
Can l help?

26:44.093 --> 26:46.250
l think we got it under control.

26:47.178 --> 26:48.256
There we go.

26:50.221 --> 26:52.093
- Damn it.
- What?

26:53.181 --> 26:54.722
Stairs.

26:57.309 --> 26:59.384
Maybe there's
a back way or something.

26:59.560 --> 27:01.635
And then what am l supposed to do?
Take an elevator?

27:01.853 --> 27:05.054
Hey, hey, don't worry about it.
We can handle the situation.

27:05.605 --> 27:07.513
l don't know, guys,
l'm kind of heavy.

27:07.690 --> 27:09.231
This stairwell's kind of steep.

27:12.901 --> 27:14.394
Yo, Steve.

27:14.569 --> 27:16.691
- Give us a hand over here, pal.
- Sure, bro.

27:16.862 --> 27:19.351
- The party starter's here.
- Okay. Get it up.

27:19.530 --> 27:21.817
- High roller, here we go.
- Okay, now.

27:22.031 --> 27:23.738
Okay, l'll clear a path. Let's go.

27:24.116 --> 27:26.570
- Yeah, you do that.
- Look out, look out.

27:26.742 --> 27:29.943
- Party starter coming through.
- Donna, hurry up.

27:31.203 --> 27:34.784
- Ciao.
- Good move, Sanders.

27:36.957 --> 27:38.664
Here we go. Look out, look out.

27:45.753 --> 27:48.207
Now, this is Beverly Hills.

27:48.380 --> 27:50.502
Tal Weaver throws the best parties.

27:50.673 --> 27:53.245
Oh, well, Kelly used to date him,
but then he moved on.

27:53.425 --> 27:56.093
l didn't used to date him.
He took me to a Sting concert.

27:56.260 --> 27:57.374
lt was no big deal.

27:59.053 --> 28:01.838
- Bobby, do you need anything?
- No, l'm fine. Thanks.

28:02.055 --> 28:03.714
We're gonna go dance.
Dylan, come on.

28:03.889 --> 28:05.133
- No, Bren. No.
- Yes.

28:05.348 --> 28:07.090
Gonna get something to drink.
Need anything?

28:07.266 --> 28:09.138
- l'll go with you.
- Bobby, you okay?

28:09.476 --> 28:10.506
Fine.

28:17.605 --> 28:20.688
Oh, my God, l'm so sorry.
Are you okay?

28:21.524 --> 28:24.309
Yeah. Maybe you could get me
a towel or something maybe?

28:24.484 --> 28:26.107
l'll get it for you.

28:26.277 --> 28:28.945
l cannot believe her. You okay?

28:31.447 --> 28:33.652
Oh, what happened to you, man?

28:34.198 --> 28:36.604
Nothing. l'm just real lazy.

28:37.242 --> 28:38.616
That's pretty funny, man.

28:38.784 --> 28:40.941
You hear what that dude
in the wheelchair said to me?

28:41.119 --> 28:44.284
He's such a jerk.
Don't worry about it, all right?

28:44.871 --> 28:47.325
The total lQ in this place
must be less than a hundred.

28:47.498 --> 28:50.118
l'm telling you, Kelly.
l am so glad l'm out of high school.

28:50.708 --> 28:52.201
l'll bet.

28:58.546 --> 29:00.584
- Hey, Kelly.
- Hi, Tal.

29:00.755 --> 29:03.244
l was wondering when you were
gonna get here.

29:03.424 --> 29:05.131
Well, here l am.

29:05.341 --> 29:07.913
You look roaring to go, let's dance.

29:09.719 --> 29:13.549
Tal, this is Bobby,
a cousin of Brandon's.

29:14.347 --> 29:15.626
How'd you get up those steps?

29:16.056 --> 29:17.383
lt wasn't easy.

29:18.015 --> 29:20.683
Well, are you okay?
Can l get you anything?

29:21.351 --> 29:24.101
Actually, a cold beer
would be nice right about now.

29:24.311 --> 29:26.219
Sorry, bud, no alcohol.

29:26.437 --> 29:28.724
Last time we had beer,
we ran into some problems

29:28.938 --> 29:31.474
and my parents
are pretty intense about that.

29:32.357 --> 29:34.681
So you wanna dance?

29:34.859 --> 29:37.099
- l don't know.
- Why not?

29:43.363 --> 29:44.737
Go ahead.

29:45.073 --> 29:48.025
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

29:48.533 --> 29:50.109
Will you hold my purse?

29:50.284 --> 29:51.658
Sure.

30:27.181 --> 30:30.465
Hey, Bob, is there some
serious talent here or what?

30:30.641 --> 30:32.300
Yeah.

30:32.475 --> 30:34.846
Listen, could you find
Brandon for me?

30:35.060 --> 30:37.182
l'm not feeling good,
l'd kind of like to go home.

30:37.395 --> 30:40.727
- Yeah, something l can do for you?
- Could you just find him for me?

30:41.439 --> 30:43.181
Sure, bud.

30:53.821 --> 30:55.563
- Hi.
- Here's your purse.

30:55.781 --> 30:57.274
Thanks.

30:57.948 --> 31:00.319
l guess l'm not a fun person
to go to a party with.

31:00.533 --> 31:03.698
- l can't do much but sit here.
- That's not true.

31:04.244 --> 31:07.611
Unless l get drunk
and l start doing wheelies.

31:11.164 --> 31:14.365
Listen, Kelly, it was really great
meeting you and everything

31:14.583 --> 31:17.251
and there's probably a lot of things
l haven't told you.

31:17.418 --> 31:19.705
Like how incredibly sewy
l think you are

31:20.211 --> 31:23.080
and how l love the way
your body moves when you dance.

31:23.797 --> 31:26.713
So l'm just gonna say it all
right now, so you can say,

31:26.882 --> 31:29.454
''Gee, Bobby,
l really think you're nice.

31:29.675 --> 31:32.164
And l really like spending time
with you and all,

31:32.385 --> 31:35.468
but l just don't like you in that way.''

31:35.637 --> 31:38.921
Let's save ourselves the grief, because
l know how these things work out.

31:39.389 --> 31:41.131
Bobby, what are you talking about?

31:41.349 --> 31:44.930
l'm talking about two weeks from now
or six months from now.

31:45.309 --> 31:49.470
A few more parties like this
and when the novelty wears off

31:49.645 --> 31:52.430
and you wanna dance
with your boyfriend.

31:56.149 --> 31:59.314
Bobby, there you are, l've been looking
all over for you, is everything okay?

31:59.484 --> 32:01.025
No, Brandon.
l'm not feeling that good.

32:01.194 --> 32:02.356
l'd kind of like to go home.

32:02.528 --> 32:05.278
Yeah, sure. You don't wanna hang
around for a couple more minutes?

32:05.613 --> 32:08.529
No. Now, please.
l can take care of the cab.

32:08.698 --> 32:11.697
But, you know,
l just need help with the stairs.

32:12.659 --> 32:15.362
Yeah, sure.
Just let me go find Dylan.

32:24.957 --> 32:26.498
Nice work, Kel.

32:38.215 --> 32:40.420
Kelly, what did you do?

32:41.175 --> 32:44.258
l don't know.
l don't even know what happened.

32:44.427 --> 32:46.502
You must have said something
to upset him like that.

32:46.678 --> 32:48.835
But l don't know.

32:49.013 --> 32:51.502
Somebody accidentally spilled
a drink on him

32:51.681 --> 32:53.055
and then l went to dance with Tal.

32:53.224 --> 32:55.096
And when l came back,
it's like he flipped out.

32:55.267 --> 32:57.803
You know, l told you not
to lead him on. lt's not fair.

32:58.018 --> 32:59.677
You think because
Bobby's in a wheelchair

32:59.853 --> 33:02.473
you have the right
to interfere with his social life.

33:02.646 --> 33:05.930
Did it ever occur to you
that l like being with him?

33:06.565 --> 33:08.307
Kelly, he's hurt enough.

33:08.483 --> 33:10.355
l don't wanna see him
get hurt anymore.

33:11.651 --> 33:13.856
Brenda, l did not mean to hurt him.

33:31.204 --> 33:33.776
So you wanna tell me
what this is all about?

33:35.248 --> 33:37.619
lt's amazing, Brandon.

33:37.958 --> 33:40.115
Most of the time
l actually fool myself

33:40.293 --> 33:42.782
into thinking
that everything's normal.

33:43.503 --> 33:45.708
l try to believe that the only thing
different about me

33:45.879 --> 33:49.578
is that l'm sitting down
while everyone else is standing up.

33:51.466 --> 33:52.710
And then every once in a while,

33:52.883 --> 33:55.882
l get this glimpse of how everyone
really must see me.

33:58.595 --> 34:01.713
Did Kelly say something
or do something?

34:01.889 --> 34:03.845
Kelly's great.

34:04.015 --> 34:06.718
But let's get real, Brandon.

34:07.267 --> 34:09.638
lf l come out here
and go to school,

34:09.810 --> 34:11.766
how's it gonna work out
in the long run?

34:12.478 --> 34:13.936
l don't know. You tell me.

34:14.146 --> 34:16.681
Well, she's not gonna
wanna compromise.

34:17.398 --> 34:20.018
This gets old real fast.

34:21.317 --> 34:24.351
My charms wear thin
after about the third or fourth date.

34:24.527 --> 34:26.234
And most girls realise
that they don't want

34:26.402 --> 34:29.485
to get serious about
some guy in a wheelchair.

34:32.114 --> 34:34.485
Trust me, l've been there.

34:36.534 --> 34:38.690
ls that what Kelly said?

34:40.578 --> 34:42.902
l saved us both the pain.

34:44.871 --> 34:47.112
So, what do you do, Bobby?

34:47.290 --> 34:49.495
You just blow off any girl
who gets too close to you?

34:49.666 --> 34:53.282
- That doesn't sound like you, man.
- What do you know about me?

34:54.878 --> 34:59.834
You have no idea
what l have to deal with every day.

35:00.006 --> 35:02.412
Everything in my life is an effort.

35:02.591 --> 35:05.590
That's why you're so amazing, Bobby.
You make it seem so easy.

35:05.759 --> 35:09.837
Come on. No one wants
to hang around with a drag.

35:10.012 --> 35:11.719
Don't you get it?

35:12.972 --> 35:14.169
ln my mind,

35:14.347 --> 35:18.757
when l imagine myself
doing things, l'm still walking.

35:18.933 --> 35:20.841
l have dreams that l'm running.

35:21.018 --> 35:24.966
And when l wake up,
l expect to just jump out of bed.

35:26.063 --> 35:30.639
And at least once a day,
no matter how well things are going,

35:30.815 --> 35:36.020
l can't help but wonder
why this happened to me.

35:36.318 --> 35:40.064
l mean, what on earth
did l ever do to deserve this?

35:41.530 --> 35:42.940
You know?

35:44.698 --> 35:46.156
l know.

35:47.783 --> 35:49.940
lt doesn't make any sense.

35:54.996 --> 35:58.197
l remember when l was little,

35:59.165 --> 36:01.701
l used to think
you could do anything.

36:02.375 --> 36:04.497
And l wanted to do
everything you did.

36:07.378 --> 36:10.662
l'll never forget how much fun
we were having the day you got hurt.

36:10.839 --> 36:12.996
Come on, Brandon, this is old news.

36:13.924 --> 36:16.674
Yeah, l know, but we've never really
talked about it, have we?

36:22.887 --> 36:25.423
l remember there was
a foot of fresh powder.

36:26.014 --> 36:28.301
And you had to be
the first one out on the hill.

36:28.474 --> 36:30.216
Always.

36:30.392 --> 36:32.015
And you were bombing
down the run

36:32.226 --> 36:34.976
and l was doing everything l could
to keep up with you.

36:37.687 --> 36:40.935
- And then l saw the jump.
- No, l saw it.

36:41.148 --> 36:42.606
No, l saw it first.

36:44.900 --> 36:48.563
And l knew it was a big drop,
but l knew it was a steep hill.

36:50.028 --> 36:52.434
l also knew that
you couldn't resist a dare.

36:52.905 --> 36:55.192
No, Brandon,
it was my idea to take the jump.

36:55.364 --> 36:57.604
Come on, Bobby.
l was there, remember?

36:59.742 --> 37:02.658
You took off, man,
and it was beautiful.

37:05.037 --> 37:08.902
And l was awestruck and then--

37:10.665 --> 37:12.740
Right into the tree.

37:15.251 --> 37:18.700
l can't help thinking, if l had just kept
my stupid mouth shut--

37:18.920 --> 37:21.125
- Hey, enough of that.
- You'd still be walking.

37:22.880 --> 37:26.377
And when did l ever need you
to goad me into taking a jump? Huh?

37:26.549 --> 37:28.291
l saw that thing coming
from a country mile.

37:28.467 --> 37:30.956
Damn it, Bobby. Can you just
remember how it happened?

37:31.177 --> 37:34.093
- Why?
- Because l'm sorry, all right?

37:34.512 --> 37:37.677
Can't l ever just tell you
that l'm sorry?

37:49.396 --> 37:51.802
l mean, what are you trying
to protect me from, anyway?

37:54.399 --> 37:56.639
Well, maybe l'm just
protecting myself.

37:57.609 --> 37:59.896
You're my favourite cousin,
Brandon.

38:02.070 --> 38:03.812
l lost enough friends
after the accident.

38:03.988 --> 38:06.904
l just don't wanna lay
all this stuff on you and lose you.

38:07.490 --> 38:10.323
Well, l wish you would've laid
some of it on me.

38:11.200 --> 38:13.654
l'm here for you, Bobby.
l can handle it.

38:20.914 --> 38:22.905
Well, l guess however
you wanna remember that day

38:23.082 --> 38:25.157
isn't gonna change things one bit.

38:25.542 --> 38:27.083
But at least we won't have
to go around

38:27.251 --> 38:28.993
pretending everything's perfect,
will we?

38:32.087 --> 38:34.078
lt's not, believe me.

38:35.297 --> 38:37.335
You know, Brandon,

38:38.424 --> 38:41.708
maybe coming out here
was a big mistake.

38:43.094 --> 38:47.042
l wanna do everything,
you know?

38:47.221 --> 38:50.090
l don't wanna have limitations.

38:52.141 --> 38:55.590
But it's nights like this that
make me think l'm just fooling myself.

38:59.687 --> 39:01.429
So get some sleep, buddy.

39:01.604 --> 39:03.844
Things always look better
in the morning.

39:04.022 --> 39:06.428
Boy, you still are a Walsh.

39:08.817 --> 39:10.524
Through and through.

39:15.112 --> 39:17.317
Just remember one thing.

39:18.114 --> 39:20.734
l love you, man. l really do.

39:22.742 --> 39:26.275
Me too. Brandon, me too.

39:56.970 --> 39:58.380
Hi.

39:59.305 --> 40:00.549
Hi.

40:01.472 --> 40:02.669
Can we talk?

40:03.891 --> 40:05.432
Sure.

40:05.600 --> 40:08.683
lf you can reach me the juicer,
l'll squeeze you some orange juice.

40:19.566 --> 40:22.518
That was pretty unfair
of you last night.

40:22.693 --> 40:24.933
l don't know.
The way l see it,

40:25.111 --> 40:27.779
somebody's gonna be
unfair eventually.

40:28.363 --> 40:30.271
How do you know?

40:31.115 --> 40:32.774
Experience.

40:33.116 --> 40:35.154
lt's taught me
some pretty brutal lessons.

40:36.159 --> 40:39.242
We were having fun together.
l like you.

40:39.453 --> 40:41.444
As a friend, right?

40:41.621 --> 40:44.620
Of course as a friend.
What's wrong with that?

40:44.789 --> 40:47.492
Because l've got enough friends.

40:49.042 --> 40:51.745
Why are you putting all
these expectations on me?

40:51.960 --> 40:53.287
l've only known you for two days.

40:53.461 --> 40:55.417
What am l supposed to do?
Throw myself at you?

40:55.587 --> 40:56.701
No.

40:56.921 --> 40:59.208
Then why don't you just lighten up?

40:59.381 --> 41:01.456
l mean, it sounds to me
like any girl who likes you

41:01.632 --> 41:03.458
has to make
a lifelong commitment to you.

41:04.342 --> 41:07.010
l'm sorry but l'm not ready
to do that.

41:07.219 --> 41:09.459
Not after our first date.

41:09.929 --> 41:11.470
l know.

41:11.680 --> 41:15.722
But somewhere along the line,
you must have asked yourself,

41:15.891 --> 41:19.554
l mean, if you could, you know,

41:19.768 --> 41:22.767
see yourself with somebody
in a wheelchair.

41:24.562 --> 41:28.558
Yes, as a matter of fact,
l did give that some thought.

41:29.399 --> 41:31.225
And what did you come up with?

41:31.400 --> 41:34.565
That it wasn't something
l could figure out in my head,

41:34.735 --> 41:36.975
like l usually try to do.

41:37.820 --> 41:39.692
And that's why
what you did last night,

41:39.863 --> 41:42.352
not even giving me
the benefit of the doubt,

41:42.698 --> 41:44.274
made me so mad.

41:44.449 --> 41:45.479
Why?

41:45.658 --> 41:48.776
Because l wasn't thinking
about all that stuff.

41:50.077 --> 41:52.566
l guess l was just being
lead by the heart.

42:02.418 --> 42:06.200
Are you gonna reach
that orange juice squeezer for me?

42:08.213 --> 42:10.335
Where'd you learn to cook, anyway?

42:14.258 --> 42:17.008
- Hi.
- Good morning.

42:17.426 --> 42:19.133
Were you guys just standing
at the door?

42:19.344 --> 42:21.833
No, we just got here, we swear.

42:22.179 --> 42:24.419
So, Bobby, where's the coffee, pal?

42:24.597 --> 42:26.553
l'll make it.

42:29.600 --> 42:30.927
Good morning.

42:31.143 --> 42:32.885
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

42:33.227 --> 42:35.384
Well, Kelly, what on earth--?

42:35.645 --> 42:37.055
Well, l'm stunned.

42:37.647 --> 42:39.804
Will wonders never cease?

42:39.981 --> 42:42.980
All l know is, Bobby, if you're planning
to make breakfast every morning,

42:43.150 --> 42:45.770
you're gonna be a welcome addition
to this house.

42:45.943 --> 42:47.140
What are you talking about?

42:47.360 --> 42:49.232
Well, you know, if you decide
to go to UCLA.

42:49.737 --> 42:53.318
Uncle Jim, no offence,
but if l do go to UCLA,

42:53.489 --> 42:54.863
l'm not gonna be staying here.

42:56.824 --> 43:00.072
l'm gonna live in a dorm or,
you know, live in my own apartment.

43:00.285 --> 43:03.320
That's one of the main reasons
why l wanted to transfer out here,

43:03.495 --> 43:04.869
is to get out on my own.

43:06.372 --> 43:08.944
Seriously, Dad.
Who'd want to live here, anyway?

43:09.165 --> 43:10.788
You, l hope.

43:12.208 --> 43:13.915
So, Bobby,

43:14.084 --> 43:16.620
we've got the entire day free
until your plane takes off.

43:16.836 --> 43:18.993
Anything you wanna do, we'll do.

43:19.171 --> 43:21.411
How about you, Brenda?
You up for anything?

43:22.464 --> 43:24.171
Sure, whatever we have time for.

43:25.257 --> 43:27.414
l got a great idea.

43:29.218 --> 43:31.209
Come on, Brenda.
You gotta break the ice sometime.

43:31.386 --> 43:33.626
l mean, if l can drive,
you can drive.

43:33.804 --> 43:36.175
Look, l know.
lt's not as if l'm afraid or anything.

43:36.347 --> 43:38.634
l just haven't gotten around to it.

43:38.807 --> 43:40.466
Bye, Bobby.
Call us when you get in.

43:41.017 --> 43:43.008
Have a nice flight.

43:43.601 --> 43:46.684
- Be sure to write.
- Here.

43:47.312 --> 43:48.342
Thanks.

43:48.521 --> 43:50.014
Give me a call
when you get into town.

43:50.189 --> 43:52.476
Definitely.
l'm gonna need a friend out here.

43:52.648 --> 43:54.307
You've got one.

43:55.942 --> 43:58.099
All right, Bren, let's go.
What are we waiting for?

43:58.277 --> 44:00.103
Everybody buckled?

44:03.738 --> 44:08.065
Here we go. Oh, how l hate reverse.

44:10.575 --> 44:12.447
- You've got it.
- Am l on the grass?

44:12.618 --> 44:15.072
- Nope, you're fine.
- You're fine.

44:18.997 --> 44:21.830
- Bren, keep your eyes on the road.
- l saw him. l saw him.

44:21.999 --> 44:26.991
- Oh, the kerb. Sorry.
- You were crazy to let her drive.

44:27.460 --> 44:29.949
Drive safely.

44:30.129 --> 44:34.171
- l saw him.
- Are you sure?
