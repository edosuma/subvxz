17:33.618 --> 17:34.618
Yes.

If the owner thought that was a
fair price, they would've taken it.

to see if they can get more.

310. Um, can I get 320?

20:39.814 --> 20:40.916
320.

20:40.917 --> 20:44.804
[EXCITEDLY] $320,000. Can
I get, um... can I get 330?

20:45.472 --> 20:47.026
$330,000?

20:48.399 --> 20:49.938
$320,000 going once...

20:49.963 --> 20:51.242
$325,000.

20:51.840 --> 20:54.079
OK, we're at $325,000.

20:54.079 --> 20:55.359
Um, can I get 330?

20:56.394 --> 20:57.753
- Graham?
- No!

20:57.918 --> 20:59.677
I was only willing to bid 320.

21:00.109 --> 21:03.238
OK. Uh, 330, anyone?

21:04.278 --> 21:06.238
$325,000 going once.

21:07.758 --> 21:09.619
$325,000 going twice.

21:11.290 --> 21:13.195
- Sold! For 325...
- [FRANK GRUNTS]

21:13.638 --> 21:15.024
I am so sorry, Frank!

21:15.678 --> 21:17.277
I knew this was a waste of time.

21:17.278 --> 21:19.146
Yeah, sorry. Beautiful day, though.

21:19.398 --> 21:20.438
Thanks again, Bruce.

21:20.439 --> 21:21.677
Please don't be upset if I don't call.

21:21.678 --> 21:22.840
I won't be!

21:22.840 --> 21:25.279
Em, thank you so much. If you...

21:25.280 --> 21:27.199
Stop. I went on a date with Bruce.

21:27.463 --> 21:29.039
Oh... I know.

21:29.263 --> 21:31.703
I may have, um... seen you guys at the pub.

21:32.863 --> 21:34.066
I think we're in love.

21:34.066 --> 21:35.259
What?!

21:35.309 --> 21:37.588
I mean... whatever makes you happy.

21:37.706 --> 21:40.080
- We are so not, but thank you.
- Oh, thank God!

21:40.306 --> 21:41.745
You sold a house!

21:41.746 --> 21:43.505
Well, I... [SIGHS] You
mean we sold a house!

21:43.506 --> 21:44.971
I mean, I can't believe you...

21:45.781 --> 21:47.185
Sorry, shouldn't you be at the bank?

21:47.186 --> 21:48.421
Yes, I should be.

21:58.064 --> 21:59.065
BARBARA: Right.

21:59.433 --> 22:01.544
Thanks, Jocelyn. I appreciate it.

22:04.843 --> 22:06.465
She's willing to give you another go,

22:06.466 --> 22:08.345
if you promise not to kidnap customers

22:08.346 --> 22:10.047
and run out midway through your shift.

22:10.791 --> 22:12.065
Seems reasonable.

22:12.742 --> 22:14.461
- This sucks.
- Hmm?

22:14.826 --> 22:17.305
This. It... it sucks.

22:17.666 --> 22:19.314
Is that all you wanted to say?

22:19.411 --> 22:21.939
No, it just... doesn't feel right.

22:21.994 --> 22:24.369
Em belongs here. We're a team.

22:25.174 --> 22:26.854
It's not as much fun without you.

22:27.133 --> 22:29.844
Are you under the impression that
work should be fun at all times?

22:29.844 --> 22:31.010
No, it's just...

22:32.454 --> 22:33.893
I don't want to work here without Em.

22:33.894 --> 22:35.453
- It's OK.
- Daniel...

22:35.537 --> 22:36.856
I want to split my wage with Emma.

22:36.881 --> 22:38.760
You can have two employees
for the price of one.

22:38.810 --> 22:39.857
What?

22:40.014 --> 22:42.066
I didn't sell that house today. We did.

22:42.826 --> 22:44.284
Feel free to say no. I just...

22:44.574 --> 22:46.537
I get the feeling the bank's not for you.

22:47.494 --> 22:48.694
I hate it!

22:48.695 --> 22:51.213
I got a bit of paper in the bin
from miles away and no-one saw.

22:51.214 --> 22:52.214
That sucks.

22:52.215 --> 22:54.053
And they don't even have a
button for if robbers come in.

22:54.054 --> 22:55.533
- Well, we've got to rob that bank.
- I know!

22:55.534 --> 22:56.734
Are you both finished?

22:57.934 --> 23:00.734
Emma, do you want to work here?

23:02.254 --> 23:03.933
Do hip-hop dance crews

23:03.934 --> 23:06.649
like finishing on a sound
effect of glass breaking?

23:09.294 --> 23:10.412
Yes.

23:11.953 --> 23:13.073
Alright.

23:13.519 --> 23:14.786
That's it?

23:14.992 --> 23:16.465
If you split your wage.

23:16.490 --> 23:17.769
Well, it's more of a gesture.

23:17.794 --> 23:19.953
But you need to understand
that small businesses like this

23:19.978 --> 23:23.262
cannot stay afloat unless
everyone is bringing in an income.

23:24.178 --> 23:28.019
Now, today, for the first time,
that's exactly what you both did.

23:29.474 --> 23:31.273
So, we're workmates again?

23:31.274 --> 23:33.513
What, you need a certificate? Yes.

23:33.631 --> 23:34.833
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

23:34.834 --> 23:36.970
- And we sold a house!
- What-what?!

23:36.970 --> 23:39.809
Now you only need to sell two more
to meet your quota for the month.

23:40.584 --> 23:42.275
- Two more?
- For the month?

23:42.408 --> 23:44.287
Yes, well, technically, it's four a month,

23:44.288 --> 23:46.008
but I thought I'd go easy on you.

23:47.008 --> 23:48.006
Thanks.

23:48.288 --> 23:50.528
Now, which one of you broke my stapler?

23:52.928 --> 23:54.277
BOTH: Mrs Marsh.

24:27.088 --> 24:29.687
Daniel and Emma said it was
you who broke my stapler.

24:29.688 --> 24:30.949
Is that true?

24:36.350 --> 24:38.059
Emma threw it after

24:38.084 --> 24:41.051
Daniel tried to sell it to her.

24:43.288 --> 24:44.807
- Let's go sell a house.
- Two!

24:44.808 --> 24:46.808
- Great. I'll drive.
