WEBVTT

00:05.333 --> 00:08.166
- 'The ginger lipstick.'
- 'I don't know, Tenley.'

00:08.250 --> 00:10.208
(Tenley)
'No frumpy
on your wedding day.'

00:10.291 --> 00:12.250
(female #1)
'And those extensions?
They're awful.'

00:12.333 --> 00:14.625
(Tenley)
'Something borrowed. Dan.'

00:14.709 --> 00:15.917
Help me.

00:17.625 --> 00:19.083
W-with what?

00:19.166 --> 00:22.792
You want a hot bride, right?
Long hair, some makeup for once?

00:22.875 --> 00:26.583
Yeah. Well,
I...I think Anna is
beautiful.

00:28.166 --> 00:31.125
Well...uh, there's a lonely
groomsman in the bar

00:31.208 --> 00:33.125
who needs my company.

00:33.208 --> 00:34.875
See you at the altar.

00:37.500 --> 00:39.291
Don't lose those rings, cowboy.

00:39.375 --> 00:40.583
No, ma'am.

00:40.667 --> 00:42.625
My friends are very
charmed by you, Dan.

00:42.709 --> 00:44.083
Oh, I'm-I'm glad.

00:44.166 --> 00:46.041
And I've been
guaranteed page one

00:46.125 --> 00:47.500
of the Society section tomorrow.

00:47.583 --> 00:48.959
- He doesn't care, mom.
- 'Oh!'

00:49.041 --> 00:50.542
(Joan)
'This is the event
of the summer.'

00:50.625 --> 00:52.625
I have over a year in it.
I care.

00:52.709 --> 00:54.417
It's been storybook.

00:54.500 --> 00:56.291
Now, maybe they'll let us
into the Milton Club.

00:56.375 --> 00:58.792
Now, Joan, let's
leave 'em alone.

00:58.875 --> 01:02.125
Hey, thanks.
Ed, you were very
generous.

01:02.208 --> 01:04.375
Well, she's my girl.

01:04.458 --> 01:06.083
You'll get the bouquet
in the morning?

01:06.166 --> 01:07.583
Bouquet,
boutonnieres, veil.

01:07.667 --> 01:10.250
You two just get to
the church on time.

01:15.291 --> 01:18.333
Yes. My mother is
a social climber.

01:18.417 --> 01:20.250
- And my sister's a slut.
- Yeah.

01:20.333 --> 01:22.208
But they're part
of the package, babe.

01:22.291 --> 01:24.875
Well, honey,
your dad's
nice.

01:29.709 --> 01:31.834
For better or worse, right?

01:33.667 --> 01:34.542
Anna..

01:37.625 --> 01:40.083
I can't go through with it.

02:33.083 --> 02:34.875
Ah. Hey.

02:34.959 --> 02:36.250
Looking sharp.

02:36.333 --> 02:38.583
Man, I hate weddings.

02:38.667 --> 02:41.083
Six hours talking
to people you don't know.

02:41.166 --> 02:42.542
- Yeah.
- What's to hate?

02:42.625 --> 02:44.875
Plus, Nova
plays
UCONN tonight.

02:44.959 --> 02:48.083
I'm guessing Louie
ain't into hoops.

02:48.166 --> 02:50.375
[chuckles]
How'd John get out of this?

02:50.458 --> 02:52.583
He's at home,
watching the pregame.

02:52.667 --> 02:54.542
Not too swift, huh?

02:54.625 --> 02:56.834
Invites us, but not the boss.

02:56.917 --> 02:58.250
Why are we here?

02:58.333 --> 03:01.208
I mean, I see Louie at crime
scenes, what, twice a year?

03:01.291 --> 03:03.583
I...got roped
into his bachelor party.

03:03.667 --> 03:05.041
At his chess club.

03:05.125 --> 03:07.417
Shoot me now.

03:07.500 --> 03:10.875
End of the night, though,
after all the booze..

03:10.959 --> 03:12.625
...I heard something
interesting.

03:12.709 --> 03:14.250
Yeah?

03:14.333 --> 03:16.208
That girl Louie 's marrying..

03:16.291 --> 03:18.417
...almost got hitched
two years ago.

03:18.500 --> 03:19.542
Almost?

03:19.625 --> 03:22.041
Groom called it off,
night before.

03:22.125 --> 03:23.000
Uh-oh.

03:23.083 --> 03:25.166
Few hours later he's tossed..

03:25.250 --> 03:27.583
...off a balcony, ten floors.

03:27.667 --> 03:29.000
Cherry Hill Regency.

03:29.083 --> 03:31.208
- Jersey cops clear it?
- Nope.

03:31.291 --> 03:34.875
Bride was top of the list,
but couldn't make the case.

03:34.959 --> 03:37.250
And now she's marrying Louie?

03:37.333 --> 03:38.875
Uh-huh.

03:38.959 --> 03:40.083
(Louie)
'Hey, guys!'

03:41.375 --> 03:42.333
How you doing?

03:42.417 --> 03:43.792
Hey, Louie.

03:44.875 --> 03:45.792
You're looking good.

03:45.875 --> 03:47.166
Yeah, you, too.
You, too.

03:47.250 --> 03:48.542
I'll see you in there,
alright?

03:48.625 --> 03:49.959
- Uh-ha.
- Yeah.

03:50.041 --> 03:51.458
[chuckles]
Aah..

03:51.542 --> 03:55.709
Whoo! Might not be
such a boring night, after
all.

04:37.291 --> 04:39.792
This is really how we
want
to spend our night off?

04:39.875 --> 04:40.792
Working a case?

04:40.875 --> 04:42.667
It's that or the chicken dance.

04:42.750 --> 04:44.750
We gotta. For Louie.

04:44.834 --> 04:46.875
You go by Cherry Hill PD?

04:46.959 --> 04:48.000
Yeah, bunch of gorks.

04:48.083 --> 04:49.333
All glued to some football game.

04:49.417 --> 04:50.333
Basketball.

04:50.417 --> 04:51.375
And they weren't getting off

04:51.458 --> 04:53.208
their duffs for a Philly cop.

04:53.291 --> 04:54.208
You get anything?

04:54.291 --> 04:56.667
Groom was Dan Palmer.

04:56.750 --> 04:59.709
Told this girl no-go on
the wedding at midnight.

04:59.792 --> 05:00.959
Rough move.

05:01.041 --> 05:03.250
At 3:15, someone took
him
to task for it.

05:03.333 --> 05:05.041
A big scuffle
on a hotel
balcony

05:05.125 --> 05:07.542
broken glass,
tossed
furniture..

05:07.625 --> 05:09.208
...Dan hits the pavement.

05:09.291 --> 05:10.875
That's a lot of people
with motive.

05:10.959 --> 05:12.834
- Starting with the bride.
- She give a statement?

05:12.917 --> 05:14.083
Whole family stonewalled.

05:14.166 --> 05:16.250
The lawyer swooped
in, no interviews.

05:16.333 --> 05:18.875
Smart. Unfortunately.

05:18.959 --> 05:20.250
Who had access to the room?

05:20.333 --> 05:22.208
It was a suite for
the whole wedding
party.

05:22.291 --> 05:23.625
So, anyone.

05:23.709 --> 05:26.709
Well, security recorded
two key entries to the
room

05:26.792 --> 05:29.250
a few minutes
apart,
around 3:00 a.m.

05:29.333 --> 05:30.375
Dan and the doer.

05:30.458 --> 05:31.625
One other mystery

05:31.709 --> 05:33.458
Dan had the wedding
rings
that night.

05:33.542 --> 05:35.375
But they were gone
after the murder.

05:35.458 --> 05:36.583
Consolation prize.

05:36.667 --> 05:38.667
[sighs]
Poor Louie.

05:38.750 --> 05:40.083
Caught up with a black widow.

05:40.166 --> 05:42.458
I don't know.
My money goes to the dad.

05:42.542 --> 05:45.417
Humiliate my girl
stiff me for a hundred G's?

05:45.500 --> 05:46.583
(Valens)
'I say mom.'

05:46.667 --> 05:49.000
Mess with the baby cub,
she eats you up.

05:49.083 --> 05:50.583
Hmm.

05:50.667 --> 05:52.625
She does look
pretty fierce.

05:52.709 --> 05:55.500
Hues? I mean,
what were you thinking?

05:57.417 --> 05:58.959
Go make a friend, Scotty.

06:08.542 --> 06:10.458
Uh, I got it.

06:12.875 --> 06:15.208
You're a bright spot
on a dark day.

06:15.291 --> 06:17.125
Your
daughter's
wedding?

06:17.208 --> 06:18.709
It's dark?

06:18.792 --> 06:21.291
This isn't the man
she was supposed to marry.

06:21.375 --> 06:23.041
No, huh?

06:23.125 --> 06:25.667
He's probably
a friend of yours.

06:25.750 --> 06:26.917
Louie..

06:27.000 --> 06:29.458
...he's more of
an acquaintance.

06:29.542 --> 06:30.792
High school.

06:30.875 --> 06:32.875
Looks like you've climbed
a rung or two higher

06:32.959 --> 06:34.083
than he did since then.

06:34.166 --> 06:36.917
[chuckles]
I've done
okay.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.041
Lawyer?

06:38.125 --> 06:39.917
No. Banker.

06:41.959 --> 06:43.458
It's obvious, huh?

06:44.875 --> 06:47.625
Well, Anna went
to Sarah Lawrence.

06:47.709 --> 06:49.166
Teaches at Whitman Prep.

06:49.250 --> 06:50.208
That's classy.

06:50.291 --> 06:51.959
And he's a cop.

06:53.333 --> 06:54.291
It's beneath her.

06:54.375 --> 06:55.625
She's playing it safe.

06:55.709 --> 06:58.166
- After the fiasco last
time.
- Right.

06:58.250 --> 07:01.417
You know about it, of course.
Everyone does.

07:01.500 --> 07:03.750
You like her
first choice
better?

07:03.834 --> 07:06.041
That wedding was
picture perfect.

07:06.125 --> 07:08.250
He was...perfect.

07:15.792 --> 07:18.542
Alright, uh...glasses raised.

07:18.625 --> 07:20.792
Ladies and gents.

07:20.875 --> 07:22.917
Uh, to Anna's mom

07:23.000 --> 07:25.375
'Joan, who chose the menu'

07:25.458 --> 07:27.583
the flatware, my suit.

07:28.917 --> 07:30.750
Get used to it, darling.

07:30.834 --> 07:34.041
And Ed, who let her
blow
all of his dough.

07:35.500 --> 07:37.792
But mostly to Anna..

07:37.875 --> 07:41.208
'...who found a stray
on the side of the road'

07:41.291 --> 07:42.208
and took him in.

07:42.291 --> 07:44.875
I was...aimless.

07:44.959 --> 07:46.667
'Never settling down..'

07:46.750 --> 07:48.250
A lone cowboy.

07:50.542 --> 07:52.083
Of course, the..

07:52.166 --> 07:55.875
...the beginning of something
is the end of something else.

07:57.375 --> 07:59.500
'But I have wandered enough.'

07:59.583 --> 08:02.041
And all of those
winding roads..

08:02.125 --> 08:03.709
...they led to you.

08:03.792 --> 08:05.166
I'm getting carsick.

08:08.667 --> 08:10.041
I love you.

08:18.583 --> 08:19.875
There are photographers here.

08:19.959 --> 08:21.959
We getting
this
load on film?

08:22.041 --> 08:25.000
- Ed, he's a prince.
- I don't trust him.

08:29.959 --> 08:32.083
I said give me one good reason.

08:32.166 --> 08:33.125
And?

08:33.208 --> 08:34.542
"Too handsome."

08:34.625 --> 08:36.583
Ridiculous, right?

08:36.667 --> 08:40.083
Sounds like Dan was
the one that got
away.

08:40.166 --> 08:41.166
He was Romeo.

08:41.250 --> 08:42.709
- Tragic end and all.
- Mm.

08:42.792 --> 08:45.917
That couldn't have been
too
perfect though, right?

08:46.000 --> 08:48.417
Getting cold feet?

08:48.500 --> 08:50.458
I think my husband
was behind that.

08:50.542 --> 08:51.792
No kidding.

08:51.875 --> 08:53.875
He didn't want the wedding
to happen. And it didn't.

08:53.959 --> 08:55.083
(female #2)
'Mrs. Coulson?'

08:57.750 --> 08:58.625
Showtime.

08:58.709 --> 09:00.417
I'm walking Anna
down the aisle.

09:00.500 --> 09:03.458
- Where's your husband?
- Ex.

09:03.542 --> 09:05.667
Probably at The Pearl, boozing.

09:05.750 --> 09:07.166
He's not in touch anymore.

09:17.583 --> 09:18.667
Where's Vera?

09:18.750 --> 09:20.417
- Shoe issue.
- Shh.

09:20.500 --> 09:23.250
- It's a quote.
- Oh. Hm.

09:26.542 --> 09:28.291
What'd you find out?

09:28.375 --> 09:30.709
Oh, you're not so dumb.

09:30.792 --> 09:32.000
My dad theory?

09:32.083 --> 09:33.333
Yeah, he had it out
for the groom.

09:33.417 --> 09:35.667
And guess what?
He's not even here today.

09:35.750 --> 09:37.959
- Hmm.
- That's a conversation.

09:39.041 --> 09:41.417
Someone should
track him down.

09:41.500 --> 09:43.125
Boss is available.

09:43.208 --> 09:45.875
Guy's watering hole
is The Pearl.

09:49.083 --> 09:52.709
Your guy...
sold me $200 shoes.

09:52.792 --> 09:54.125
I got blisters already.

09:54.208 --> 09:57.208
And you're still
wearing a rental.

09:57.291 --> 09:58.875
I like the paisley.

09:58.959 --> 10:00.083
Thanks.

10:00.166 --> 10:01.375
It's slimming.

10:11.667 --> 10:13.750
Poor Rube.

10:13.834 --> 10:16.166
This is the first
day
of the end of your
life.

10:51.500 --> 10:53.500
Double scotch.

10:53.583 --> 10:54.583
Make it two.

10:54.667 --> 10:56.417
(male #1)
'Two coming up.'

10:56.500 --> 10:57.875
Why not?

10:57.959 --> 10:59.333
The night is young.

10:59.417 --> 11:02.083
I got a lot to forget.

11:02.166 --> 11:03.583
What are you drinking about?

11:03.667 --> 11:07.041
- Oh, family, daughter.
- 'Here you go.'

11:07.125 --> 11:09.750
Yeah. Huh.

11:09.834 --> 11:11.125
She's running
with a bad guy

11:11.208 --> 11:14.333
and I just feel like
I got to do
something.

11:14.417 --> 11:16.583
Mine's getting married today.

11:16.667 --> 11:18.875
And you're here instead.

11:18.959 --> 11:21.250
My ex-wife banned me.

11:21.333 --> 11:23.125
So, fine.

11:23.208 --> 11:24.291
Who needs it?

11:24.375 --> 11:25.959
The guy a problem?

11:26.041 --> 11:28.875
No. I like this one,
actually.

11:28.959 --> 11:30.250
There was another one?

11:30.333 --> 11:32.959
Yeah. Long story.

11:33.041 --> 11:35.959
Short version is
he ran out on the wedding.

11:36.041 --> 11:37.166
Night before.

11:37.250 --> 11:39.500
[whistles]
That's
nuclear.

11:39.583 --> 11:40.792
Yup.

11:41.667 --> 11:43.291
You get killed on the tab?

11:43.375 --> 11:45.000
That was the easy part.

11:46.125 --> 11:48.917
That thing blew up our family.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.709
My daughter was crushed..

11:52.208 --> 11:54.542
...wife turned shrew.

11:54.625 --> 11:57.709
You may be a better man than me,
but I'd hunt him down.

12:00.333 --> 12:01.834
Truth?

12:01.917 --> 12:03.625
I was relieved the guy walked.

12:03.709 --> 12:05.375
And why's that?

12:05.458 --> 12:06.917
I have another daughter.

12:10.208 --> 12:11.500
Troublemaker.

12:11.583 --> 12:13.625
Uh-huh.

12:14.875 --> 12:17.083
I mean, that night..

12:17.166 --> 12:19.500
...I was
in an impossible situation.

12:23.875 --> 12:26.250
(Tenley)
'So that poetic
puppy dog toast?'

12:26.333 --> 12:28.792
Anna brought me
home and tamed me?

12:28.875 --> 12:30.792
Bunch of twaddle.

12:32.583 --> 12:34.208
Sorry you think so.

12:34.291 --> 12:36.166
(Tenley)
'Dan, I'm 30 years old.'

12:36.250 --> 12:38.667
I've been
with
many grooms.

12:38.750 --> 12:39.917
And?

12:40.000 --> 12:41.709
Your heart's not in it.

12:41.792 --> 12:43.875
You don't want to get married.

12:45.041 --> 12:46.709
No, I do.

12:46.792 --> 12:48.875
It's a new chapter.

12:48.959 --> 12:50.208
That's snoozy.

12:50.291 --> 12:52.500
Yeah. You don't know me.

12:52.583 --> 12:54.583
I know your type.

12:54.667 --> 12:58.250
You like freedom, options.

12:58.333 --> 13:00.250
Scrabble at home
with a brainy
wife?

13:00.333 --> 13:01.750
No, thanks.

13:01.834 --> 13:03.000
I've changed.

13:03.083 --> 13:04.667
Again, twaddle.

13:07.667 --> 13:10.125
You cannot have everything
you want.

13:10.208 --> 13:13.125
You dealt a hand
and you make it work.

13:13.208 --> 13:14.375
Dreamy.

13:14.458 --> 13:17.500
I hope my husband
talks
about me that way.

13:19.333 --> 13:20.792
Anyway, I should get back--

13:20.875 --> 13:22.542
You are who
you are,
Dan.

13:23.917 --> 13:25.792
Why don't you just face it?

13:25.875 --> 13:27.583
Come upstairs.

13:41.375 --> 13:43.250
One daughter going
after another's
groom?

13:43.333 --> 13:44.375
With abandon.

13:45.917 --> 13:47.417
That ends badly.

13:49.125 --> 13:50.500
Worse than you know.

13:56.166 --> 13:57.917
The maid of honor
hits on the groom.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.166
And dad saw it all.

13:59.250 --> 14:00.792
(Rush)
'So if I'm Anna'

14:00.875 --> 14:01.917
get wind of that..

14:02.000 --> 14:04.417
Then Romeo pulls
the rug out.

14:04.500 --> 14:06.625
And I got double motive
to smoke him.

14:06.709 --> 14:09.667
But twisted sister's
the one up in the room with
him.

14:12.709 --> 14:14.291
We shouldn't do this.

14:14.375 --> 14:17.458
We should just be like
normal people enjoy the
night.

14:17.542 --> 14:19.250
Leave it alone.
Leave it alone.

14:19.333 --> 14:20.625
Or we could fan out

14:20.709 --> 14:23.083
and talk to both the gals.

14:23.166 --> 14:25.291
- There's the receiving
line.
- I'll find the tramp.

14:25.375 --> 14:26.583
Excellent. So, what am I doing?

14:26.667 --> 14:28.250
It's a wedding.
Go meet someone.

14:28.333 --> 14:29.375
I know enough people.

14:29.458 --> 14:31.250
Get some free booze.
What's your beef?

14:31.333 --> 14:33.834
Maybe the guys in the kitchen
have the game on.

14:40.041 --> 14:41.291
- 'Valens.'
- Louie.

14:41.375 --> 14:42.667
Rush.

14:43.875 --> 14:45.333
Hope you're okay with this.

14:45.417 --> 14:47.083
Oh, I'm coping, Louie.

14:47.166 --> 14:50.458
This is my bride, Anna.

14:50.542 --> 14:52.125
Been dying to meet you.

14:52.208 --> 14:54.083
Are you colleagues?

14:54.166 --> 14:55.792
- Uh..
- Best cops I know, these two.

14:55.875 --> 14:57.125
And Louie 's our favorite tech.

14:57.208 --> 14:58.875
(Anna)
'I'm very lucky
I found him.'

14:58.959 --> 15:00.500
We met a year ago today.

15:00.583 --> 15:03.083
Whirlwind romance.

15:03.166 --> 15:04.375
I'd love to hear all about it.

15:04.458 --> 15:07.333
Anna, the line needs
to move along.

15:07.417 --> 15:09.792
Maybe we can talk later.

15:09.875 --> 15:12.000
Hey, is the boss coming?

15:12.083 --> 15:14.083
He never RSVP'd.

15:14.166 --> 15:15.458
But we saved a
spot for him.

15:15.542 --> 15:17.709
- Yeah. He'll be here.
- Okay.

15:17.792 --> 15:20.083
- 'Yeah.'
- Yeah.

15:21.750 --> 15:25.000
- Officer.
- It's detective, actually.

15:25.083 --> 15:27.208
Homicide.

15:45.917 --> 15:47.834
Ah, shrimp. Primo.

15:47.917 --> 15:49.542
Lethal drinks, too.

15:50.917 --> 15:52.875
So, you gonna take a
run
at one of those guys?

15:52.959 --> 15:54.333
Considering it.

15:54.417 --> 15:55.500
Well, you have to.

15:55.583 --> 15:57.291
It's a wedding.

15:57.375 --> 15:58.709
We think alike.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.834
And who are you here with?

16:01.917 --> 16:03.417
Solo.

16:03.500 --> 16:04.917
So you're scoping, too.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.041
Well, trying
to
keep a lid on
it.

16:07.125 --> 16:08.750
Well, the last
wedding I was
at

16:08.834 --> 16:12.125
I ended up dirty dancing
with the Lady Chaplain.

16:12.208 --> 16:13.417
I got that beat.

16:13.500 --> 16:15.583
Oh, do tell.

16:15.667 --> 16:17.542
It was Anna's first wedding

16:17.625 --> 16:19.583
which we're not supposed
to talk about.

16:19.667 --> 16:21.542
Well, we can always whisper.

16:23.417 --> 16:26.000
I took the groom
for a test drive.

16:27.583 --> 16:29.291
The guy who ditched her?

16:29.375 --> 16:31.375
That was over you?

16:31.458 --> 16:34.250
I can't help it if
I'm Helen of Troy.

16:38.625 --> 16:40.959
Here's to little sisters
trying to beat you to the
punch.

16:44.208 --> 16:45.875
- She's a good person.
- Mm-hm.

16:45.959 --> 16:47.875
Better than you or me.

16:52.375 --> 16:54.125
Oh.

16:54.208 --> 16:56.583
God, I'm messing this up.

16:56.667 --> 16:58.083
What is my problem?

16:58.166 --> 16:59.750
You're a jerk.
Live with it.

16:59.834 --> 17:01.417
I'm not. I just..

17:01.500 --> 17:02.750
Just what?

17:06.000 --> 17:08.083
- I can't talk about it.
- Then shut up.

17:22.792 --> 17:24.709
- Oh, man.
- Ignore it.

17:24.792 --> 17:26.458
(Phil)
'Danny, it's Phil.'

17:26.542 --> 17:28.709
Oh, it's my best man.

17:35.834 --> 17:37.417
(Dan)
'Hey.'

17:37.500 --> 17:40.041
'You made it, man.'

17:40.125 --> 17:42.542
Yeah. Train was late.

17:42.625 --> 17:45.000
What is this?
You drinking?

17:45.083 --> 17:47.458
Uh, just one or..

17:47.542 --> 17:48.625
...six.

17:48.709 --> 17:52.166
Dan, you're not going
off
the rails.

17:52.250 --> 17:53.792
It's not gonna work, Phil.

17:53.875 --> 17:56.875
Get downstairs
and be with your
bride.

17:56.959 --> 17:58.125
- I don't know.
- Hey.

17:58.208 --> 18:00.750
This is a good
thing
for both of us.

18:00.834 --> 18:02.792
I don't think I can do it.

18:04.208 --> 18:06.709
Look, forget Baltimore.

18:06.792 --> 18:08.166
'Okay?'

18:08.250 --> 18:09.500
'Just walk this off'

18:09.583 --> 18:11.333
get back down to that dinner.

18:11.417 --> 18:14.208
This didn't happen.

18:14.291 --> 18:15.750
Hey, did you meet her?

18:17.500 --> 18:18.959
Anna?

18:21.083 --> 18:22.625
Not what I expected.

18:32.166 --> 18:34.125
Maid of dishonor.
Oh, well.

18:34.208 --> 18:36.500
No scruples, huh?

18:36.583 --> 18:38.667
Your own blood. Cheers.

18:41.166 --> 18:43.000
Hm. She's the little sister.

18:43.083 --> 18:45.625
Getting married before me?
Inappropriate.

18:45.709 --> 18:47.208
Got you.

18:47.291 --> 18:49.875
So what the heck
was in Baltimore?

18:49.959 --> 18:52.625
I don't know.
It's their hometown.

18:52.709 --> 18:55.250
So, how was Dan getting married
good for both of them?

18:55.333 --> 18:57.041
They were always talking
about some fancy gym

18:57.125 --> 18:59.041
they wanted to buy.

18:59.125 --> 19:01.875
And Dan was about to marry rich.

19:01.959 --> 19:03.583
Yup. We're loaded.

19:03.667 --> 19:04.959
More booze?

19:05.041 --> 19:07.250
Giddy up.

19:07.333 --> 19:09.834
(Stillman)
'Phil and Dan
had a company named'

19:09.917 --> 19:11.417
Hampden, Inc.

19:11.500 --> 19:13.375
- 'Baltimore?'
- Uh-huh.

19:13.458 --> 19:15.041
Bunch of business ventures.

19:15.125 --> 19:16.208
All failed.

19:16.291 --> 19:18.000
'They filed
for bankruptcy twice.'

19:18.083 --> 19:19.917
So, empty pockets.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.542
I..

19:23.625 --> 19:24.625
I got to go.
He's here.

19:24.709 --> 19:27.333
- Hey, boss, tough news.
- What?

19:27.417 --> 19:29.625
(Valens)
'You got to suit up
and get to this thing.'

19:29.709 --> 19:30.875
What?

19:30.959 --> 19:33.542
Check your inbox
once in a while.

19:39.208 --> 19:41.000
Oh, crap.

19:43.250 --> 19:45.208
So, somebody's
charging
flights

19:45.291 --> 19:46.875
to India
on my business card?

19:46.959 --> 19:48.792
Yeah, we're circling the guy.

19:48.875 --> 19:49.917
You just sign this

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
and verify you weren't
heading to Bombay.

19:53.333 --> 19:55.583
Okay, no problem.

19:55.667 --> 19:58.041
This ever happen
with Hampden, Inc.?

19:58.125 --> 20:00.792
Uh, no. No, that company
never got its wheels up.

20:00.875 --> 20:03.709
- 'Cause you lost your
partner.
- Dan. Yeah.

20:03.792 --> 20:06.000
How'd you feel
about him jilting that girl?

20:09.458 --> 20:11.917
So, this isn't
about credit cards.

20:14.125 --> 20:15.750
March, 2008.

20:15.834 --> 20:17.792
You and Dan put a bid on..

20:17.875 --> 20:20.166
- Woodland Health And Spa.
- True.

20:20.250 --> 20:23.250
You guys didn't have
that kind of dough but Anna
did.

20:23.333 --> 20:25.792
Look, I wanted
him
to get married.

20:25.875 --> 20:28.208
- Oh, sure. No wedding, no gym.
- No.

20:28.291 --> 20:29.834
No, not for the money.
I liked Anna.

20:29.917 --> 20:32.625
- I liked her for him.
- And why's that?

20:32.709 --> 20:35.250
Because he was wasting his life.

20:35.333 --> 20:37.792
You know, too much drinking
and cheap women.

20:37.875 --> 20:38.792
Then Anna came along.

20:38.875 --> 20:40.625
Yeah. She's a straight arrow.

20:40.709 --> 20:41.959
He started living right.

20:42.041 --> 20:43.792
Yeah, but the night
before Dan's wedding

20:43.875 --> 20:46.333
he's holed up with Tenley.

20:46.417 --> 20:48.417
Yeah. Talk about cheap.

20:48.500 --> 20:50.166
Did Anna hear about that?

20:50.250 --> 20:52.125
Dan and her sister
in that suite?

20:53.250 --> 20:54.667
I don't know.

20:56.250 --> 20:58.583
I hope not.

21:06.875 --> 21:08.208
What table?

21:08.291 --> 21:09.500
Uh...14.

21:09.583 --> 21:11.500
Yeah...11.

21:11.583 --> 21:13.125
Not for long.

21:14.667 --> 21:16.000
So, where's Kat?

21:16.083 --> 21:20.834
Uh, she, uh, said
she wasn't coming if I was.

21:20.917 --> 21:23.000
Hmm. I won't ask.

21:23.083 --> 21:24.667
Good move.

21:24.750 --> 21:26.208
So, what are you up to?

21:26.291 --> 21:28.667
Trying to get
the bride
alone.

21:28.750 --> 21:30.083
Why?

21:30.166 --> 21:31.834
I've got some
questions for
her.

21:31.917 --> 21:33.542
You're working at the wedding.

21:33.625 --> 21:36.583
Well...um, yeah, I mean..

21:37.625 --> 21:39.333
- Kinda.
- Hopeless.

21:39.417 --> 21:41.792
Well, she might have
killed her first
fiancee.

21:41.875 --> 21:43.542
Am I supposed to
just overlook
that?

21:43.625 --> 21:46.709
- Well, maybe, for three
hours.
- Oh.

21:46.792 --> 21:48.583
Take it up
in the morning.

21:48.667 --> 21:50.709
Well, I have a
soft
spot for Louie.

21:50.792 --> 21:53.875
Okay. I know what we do.

21:53.959 --> 21:55.875
Uh, can I get
a club soda for the lady

21:55.959 --> 21:57.667
and a glass of
pinot, please?

21:57.750 --> 21:59.250
- Oh!
- Thank you.

21:59.333 --> 22:00.417
Well, what's our plan?

22:00.500 --> 22:05.333
Well, I am your drunk
boyfriend.
Cheers.

22:05.417 --> 22:07.125
Hey, lay off, already!

22:08.291 --> 22:09.709
Good going, Curtis.

22:09.792 --> 22:11.458
- 'What?'
- You're an idiot.

22:13.917 --> 22:15.750
- Come with me.
- Mmm.

22:21.709 --> 22:22.834
I'm sorry.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.375
Give him any chance to
booze
and he blows it.

22:26.458 --> 22:27.417
Is it coming out?

22:27.500 --> 22:28.792
Absolutely.

22:31.834 --> 22:35.041
Not that it
excuses
his sloppy ass.

22:35.125 --> 22:36.333
There.

22:36.417 --> 22:38.458
I know the type.

22:38.542 --> 22:41.917
Probably out there hitting
on a bridesmaid right now.

22:42.000 --> 22:43.417
You been with him long?

22:43.500 --> 22:45.083
Too long.

22:45.166 --> 22:47.333
He's fun, cute, but..

22:48.625 --> 22:50.625
...he's always disappointing me.

22:51.667 --> 22:53.166
Cowboy, huh?

22:53.250 --> 22:57.125
Yeah, I don't know if they
turn
into good husbands.

22:57.208 --> 22:58.417
I don't think so.

22:59.709 --> 23:01.750
Well, my friends
say
throw him back.

23:01.834 --> 23:02.834
I agree.

23:02.917 --> 23:05.291
Speaking from experience.

23:05.375 --> 23:06.792
You had one of these
tools
in your life?

23:06.875 --> 23:09.291
Yeah, I wasted
a lot of time on him.

23:10.542 --> 23:12.000
Why, it end badly?

23:12.083 --> 23:13.333
You could say.

23:15.166 --> 23:16.875
And you know what?

23:16.959 --> 23:19.083
The right guy was here
all along.

23:25.542 --> 23:26.959
(Louie)
'Anna.'

23:28.709 --> 23:30.917
- Louie? What are you--
- It's important.

23:37.875 --> 23:42.667
Okay, I know you only know
me
from Fire Safety Day.

23:42.750 --> 23:45.667
But-but we've had
talks
and laughs.

23:45.750 --> 23:48.208
And-and the field
trip
with your students.

23:48.291 --> 23:50.542
And-and-and getting pizza after.

23:50.625 --> 23:52.083
That was fun.

23:52.166 --> 23:54.917
And-and sharing that
ridiculously giant orange
crush

23:55.000 --> 23:56.500
'cause we both love it so much.

23:56.583 --> 23:58.583
The forgotten soda.

23:58.667 --> 24:01.208
That kind of good time
doesn't come along every
day.

24:03.500 --> 24:05.291
Louie, this is my
rehearsal dinner.

24:05.375 --> 24:07.417
That's why I'm here.

24:07.500 --> 24:08.792
I gotta take my shot.

24:10.458 --> 24:11.709
At what?

24:12.750 --> 24:14.291
Marry me.

24:16.083 --> 24:17.250
Are you joking?

24:17.333 --> 24:20.458
Most people,
they think I'm an
oddball

24:20.542 --> 24:21.792
you know that?

24:22.875 --> 24:24.417
I-I don't know
anything about you.

24:24.500 --> 24:29.333
But you're interested
in my work, and my
dogs

24:29.417 --> 24:31.333
and chess strategies.

24:32.667 --> 24:33.792
I have to go back inside.

24:33.875 --> 24:36.625
Hey, we have a rapport.

24:36.709 --> 24:38.083
A-a wavelength.

24:39.625 --> 24:42.959
I know once in a
lifetime
when I find it.

24:43.041 --> 24:44.834
And I'm here to grab my chance.

24:46.959 --> 24:48.250
Go home, Louie.

24:58.333 --> 25:01.333
So, you didn't meet
just last year.

25:02.834 --> 25:06.041
We tell people that 'cause
it's easier than the real
story.

25:06.125 --> 25:08.542
That I married my stalker.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.959
It's-it's our little joke.

25:14.166 --> 25:15.458
Funny.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.917
So, Louie crashed the place?

25:23.000 --> 25:26.000
He have a boom box
playing Peter Gabriel?

25:26.083 --> 25:27.375
And tried to steal Anna away.

25:27.458 --> 25:30.166
She gave him the high hat,
go figure.

25:30.250 --> 25:31.417
Lloyd Dobler, incoming.

25:31.500 --> 25:33.417
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, you guys mind?

25:35.917 --> 25:37.125
Come on, here.

25:38.166 --> 25:39.208
Thank you.

25:40.959 --> 25:42.458
I didn't know
I put you two together.

25:42.542 --> 25:45.083
Um, have a seat, Louie.

25:46.917 --> 25:49.250
So, tell us when
you really met
Anna.

25:49.333 --> 25:50.333
What do you mean?

25:50.417 --> 25:52.125
We're not buying
the whirlwind story.

25:52.208 --> 25:53.709
(Jeffries)
'Methodical guy like you.'

25:53.792 --> 25:55.542
Figure there must be a story
behind the story.

25:57.250 --> 25:58.792
Are you guys working a case?

25:59.750 --> 26:00.959
At my wedding?

26:03.458 --> 26:04.583
Dan Palmer.

26:06.041 --> 26:07.583
Oh, geez.

26:07.667 --> 26:10.750
Well, Louie, you
went
to the hotel that
night

26:10.834 --> 26:12.667
where he got killed.

26:12.750 --> 26:13.709
Ambushed Anna.

26:13.792 --> 26:15.375
I was being romantic.

26:15.458 --> 26:16.959
You got shut down.

26:17.041 --> 26:18.375
Next stop, the groom?

26:22.875 --> 26:25.709
I did see that guy
on the hotel steps.

26:25.792 --> 26:27.000
Where he died.

26:27.083 --> 26:29.792
But he was good
and alive when I left.

26:36.583 --> 26:39.500
You know she gives out
graham crackers every Friday?

26:42.000 --> 26:43.166
What?

26:45.542 --> 26:48.291
Takes the lab goggles home
on the weekends

26:48.375 --> 26:50.542
and washes them for the kids.

26:50.625 --> 26:52.709
Twenty pairs.

26:52.792 --> 26:54.417
Are you talking about Anna?

26:55.583 --> 26:57.083
I know these things about her.

27:00.959 --> 27:02.333
And I don't.

27:02.417 --> 27:04.125
I hope you know she's special.

27:05.750 --> 27:07.125
I hope you really love her.

27:09.750 --> 27:10.709
It sounds like you do.

27:10.792 --> 27:13.041
I'd make her happy every day.

27:19.458 --> 27:20.875
Hello, yeah.

27:23.458 --> 27:24.875
Melanie? She asked for me?

27:31.834 --> 27:34.709
I was a fool, but I'm no
killer.
You guys know me.

27:34.792 --> 27:36.583
Well, we also know
you lied about this.

27:36.667 --> 27:38.333
[whispers]
'Cause I was a
fool.

27:38.417 --> 27:40.959
Plus, how am I getting
in that guy's hotel
room?

27:41.041 --> 27:43.375
- That's a good point.
- Bell, shut up.

27:44.792 --> 27:45.834
So, who was Melanie?

27:45.917 --> 27:48.834
All I know, is an hour later

27:48.917 --> 27:50.041
the wedding was off.

27:51.333 --> 27:53.166
God, and you guys
are all disinvited

27:53.250 --> 27:54.959
to the champagne brunch
tomorrow.

27:57.166 --> 27:58.583
- Hey, Louie.
- Not right.

28:03.917 --> 28:05.208
What did you do?

28:05.291 --> 28:07.959
New wrinkle with our dead groom.

28:08.041 --> 28:10.417
Mystery woman reached out
to him that night.

28:10.500 --> 28:12.417
Suddenly, Dan was out of there.

28:12.500 --> 28:14.750
We're laying bets
on the doer, boss.

28:14.834 --> 28:15.750
I got the skank.

28:15.834 --> 28:17.250
- Bride.
- Mommy dearest.

28:17.333 --> 28:19.208
The winner gets a free pass
on the wedding gift.

28:20.333 --> 28:21.166
I'll go Phil.

28:21.250 --> 28:22.750
Thought you bought his story.

28:22.834 --> 28:25.041
He's young, rich, good-lookin'.

28:25.125 --> 28:26.333
I don't like the guy.

28:29.125 --> 28:30.417
Remember these, Joan?

28:31.875 --> 28:33.083
(Joan)
You can't be
here.

28:33.166 --> 28:35.208
You want me to tell Anna
where I found them?

28:35.291 --> 28:37.542
(Stillman)
Hey, Ed, let's take a walk.

28:37.625 --> 28:40.291
- You're the double scotch.
- That's right.

28:40.375 --> 28:42.625
- Dance?
- Excuse me?

28:42.709 --> 28:44.458
My friend will take care of him.

28:44.542 --> 28:46.041
Let me take care of you.

28:50.792 --> 28:52.000
Now, you've had a few, Ed.

28:52.083 --> 28:53.417
A few drinks.

28:53.500 --> 28:55.458
- A few sleepless nights.
- Easy.

28:55.542 --> 28:57.458
Few too many years
protecting that
battleaxe.

28:58.375 --> 29:00.291
Can I see those rings?

29:00.375 --> 29:02.542
Who are you, anyway?

29:02.625 --> 29:05.458
I'm a homicide lieutenant.
I know about Dan Palmer.

29:08.917 --> 29:11.375
She was my wife,
so I didn't say
anything.

29:13.000 --> 29:14.750
These were missing
from his body.

29:14.834 --> 29:16.834
Turned up in her jewelry box.

29:16.917 --> 29:18.166
After Dan died?

29:18.250 --> 29:19.417
I keep her dirty secret

29:19.500 --> 29:20.875
and what does she do?

29:20.959 --> 29:23.625
She cuts me out of Anna's life.

29:23.709 --> 29:26.125
Gets her thinking
I torpedoed the first
wedding

29:26.208 --> 29:28.542
and I don't even get
invited to this one.

29:28.625 --> 29:29.875
Well, the truth
will come out now.

29:29.959 --> 29:31.750
Oh, she can fly to hell.

29:31.834 --> 29:33.000
I don't care.

29:35.250 --> 29:36.417
But Anna..

29:42.417 --> 29:43.834
...I miss my girl.

29:49.583 --> 29:50.625
(Jeffries)
'Exes, huh?'

29:50.709 --> 29:51.750
Miserable.

29:51.834 --> 29:54.250
He knows what a big night
this is for me.

29:54.333 --> 29:56.458
So, what were those rings about?

29:57.792 --> 29:58.917
The past.

29:59.792 --> 30:00.959
Care to elaborate?

30:01.959 --> 30:03.458
It's nothing
I'm proud of, Will.

30:04.792 --> 30:06.583
You have to face
it,
to move on, Joan.

30:08.542 --> 30:09.834
You're wise, aren't you?

30:10.959 --> 30:12.125
Learned a few things.

30:14.917 --> 30:18.083
Do you believe that people are
better than their worst
actions?

30:18.166 --> 30:19.458
One hundred percent.

30:20.875 --> 30:22.000
My daughter..

30:24.375 --> 30:25.500
Tell me.

30:27.750 --> 30:29.125
Her first fiance..

30:30.208 --> 30:32.166
...he sure had me fooled.

30:32.250 --> 30:35.542
I heard about
that.
Unforgivable.

30:35.625 --> 30:37.542
And I didn't think
he should get away with it.

30:40.500 --> 30:42.834
- Where you think you're
going?
- Home.

30:42.917 --> 30:44.250
My daughter
is in the bridal suite.

30:44.333 --> 30:46.000
- A broken woman.
- I'm sorry.

30:46.083 --> 30:47.333
'You're gonna be on
the society pages tomorrow.'

30:47.417 --> 30:48.792
I'm a complete heel.

30:48.875 --> 30:50.333
Two hundred people
are showing up at the church.

30:50.417 --> 30:51.917
I know, but I have to go.

30:52.000 --> 30:53.792
- You may not do this to me.
- To you?

30:53.875 --> 30:55.583
You will be here, 10:00 a.m.

30:55.667 --> 30:57.083
I'm gonna be long gone.

30:57.166 --> 30:58.375
I'll pay you.

31:02.000 --> 31:03.875
You can get divorced in a year.

31:03.959 --> 31:05.208
Quietly, amicably.

31:05.291 --> 31:06.667
Joan, please, just let me go.

31:06.750 --> 31:08.709
We've paid for the rings,
the hotel..

31:09.625 --> 31:10.959
They're yours.

31:11.041 --> 31:12.583
I'm getting into
the Milton Club this season

31:12.667 --> 31:14.750
because my wedding is going
to be the event of the summer.

31:14.834 --> 31:16.250
Look, I cannot marry her.

31:16.333 --> 31:18.959
- Of course, you can.
- I'm already married.

31:26.709 --> 31:28.959
- Can we get a brandy?
- Oh!

31:29.041 --> 31:31.709
I, uh, never heard
that part of the
story.

31:31.792 --> 31:34.208
No, only Anna and I know that.

31:34.291 --> 31:36.125
He told Anna?

31:36.208 --> 31:38.750
He went right up to
the bridal suite to come
clean.

31:39.542 --> 31:40.709
And me?

31:40.792 --> 31:42.500
I just sat down and cried.

31:43.458 --> 31:44.834
I've been crying ever since.

31:47.000 --> 31:49.208
So, Melanie's more
than a side girl.

31:50.208 --> 31:51.625
Oh, she's a side wife.

31:51.709 --> 31:53.125
So why can't we find her?

31:54.959 --> 31:57.625
I checked marriage licenses
in every state.

31:57.709 --> 32:00.333
- Nothin'.
- Then, was he lyin'?

32:00.417 --> 32:03.250
Get
monster-in-law
off his back?

32:03.333 --> 32:05.041
Well, either way,
this girl was big enough

32:05.125 --> 32:06.709
in his life,
he dropped everything for her.

32:06.792 --> 32:08.166
Now she's our key

32:08.250 --> 32:09.417
but she's a ghost.

32:11.125 --> 32:12.542
Oh, we've gotta get back
for the cake.

32:12.625 --> 32:15.291
Yeah, wouldn't
want
to ruin Louie's
night.

32:21.542 --> 32:22.583
Scotty.

32:22.667 --> 32:24.709
It's Phil's Myspace page
from college.

32:27.917 --> 32:30.375
"Me, Dan and Mel."

32:34.083 --> 32:35.583
She looks just like Anna.

32:51.208 --> 32:52.667
Who's the girl, Phil?

32:55.625 --> 32:56.583
Where did you get this?

32:56.667 --> 32:58.000
Who's the girl?

33:01.125 --> 33:03.000
- An old friend.
- An old friend?

33:03.083 --> 33:05.542
Dan just happened
to be married to?

33:10.625 --> 33:11.625
Hey.

33:11.709 --> 33:14.667
- Hey.
- To good guys, like Louie.

33:14.750 --> 33:16.166
Husband material.

33:17.458 --> 33:18.625
Yeah, unlike Dan.

33:20.500 --> 33:21.709
Did I tell you his name?

33:21.792 --> 33:24.125
Oh, bad enough he leaves you
at the altar, but..

33:25.500 --> 33:26.667
Let's not talk about him.

33:26.750 --> 33:27.917
But then, he turns the knife.

33:29.250 --> 33:31.208
"By the way,
I'm already married."

33:32.625 --> 33:33.792
I'd kill him too.

33:35.041 --> 33:37.959
- Yeah, he was married.
- To Melanie.

33:38.041 --> 33:39.834
It was a long time ago.
They were kids.

33:39.917 --> 33:42.417
And he thought that would
just get swept under the rug?

33:42.500 --> 33:44.375
I told you,
Dan was a screwup.

33:46.375 --> 33:47.583
Anna was a new chapter.

33:47.667 --> 33:49.417
Let's hear about the old one.

33:49.500 --> 33:51.208
I don't think
I like you
anymore.

33:52.250 --> 33:54.208
Well, you don't have to like me.

33:54.291 --> 33:55.542
You just have to talk.

34:03.208 --> 34:05.542
She was from Baltimore.

34:05.625 --> 34:08.875
They eloped.
Cancun, spring
break.

34:08.959 --> 34:11.417
And he just forgot
to undo that mess

34:11.500 --> 34:13.250
all those years later?

34:13.333 --> 34:15.125
It wasn't a mess.

34:15.208 --> 34:16.458
They were in love.

34:16.542 --> 34:17.834
So why not be with her?

34:17.917 --> 34:19.625
Why twist you around?

34:21.333 --> 34:23.291
'Cause something
terrible
happened.

34:28.625 --> 34:30.166
It was years ago.

34:30.250 --> 34:31.333
College.

34:37.375 --> 34:40.291
A-and you've been with her
this whole time?

34:40.375 --> 34:42.583
You know I have been with you.

34:42.667 --> 34:44.041
Haven't you ever
heard of divorce?

34:44.959 --> 34:46.291
I couldn't do that.

34:47.709 --> 34:49.542
But you could lie to me.

34:49.625 --> 34:51.750
Anna, she's in a hospital.

34:53.125 --> 34:54.709
She has been for eight years.

34:55.667 --> 34:57.000
Why?

34:57.083 --> 34:58.667
There was an accident.

34:58.750 --> 35:01.583
In Mexico,
we were on a boat drinking.

35:04.333 --> 35:05.500
And?

35:05.583 --> 35:07.041
'She almost drowned.'

35:07.125 --> 35:09.458
And they saved her
physically, but..

35:10.834 --> 35:15.125
...she never came back,
otherwise.

35:15.208 --> 35:18.500
The first three
years,
I visited her every
day.

35:18.583 --> 35:21.625
And she was
there,
but she wasn't.

35:23.625 --> 35:25.959
And she's-she's still
in Baltimore?

35:29.291 --> 35:32.417
God, I tried to move on.

35:32.500 --> 35:33.792
Coming to Philly.

35:33.875 --> 35:35.583
A new place, new chance.

35:35.667 --> 35:38.125
And meeting you,
I felt good
again.

35:40.333 --> 35:41.667
Glad I could help out.

35:41.750 --> 35:43.583
I wanted to start over with you.

35:46.250 --> 35:47.750
It's what I want.

35:47.834 --> 35:50.291
But I can't get over it.

35:51.625 --> 35:53.250
And tonight, a nurse called.

35:53.333 --> 35:55.125
She asked for me.

35:56.917 --> 35:58.792
She's never done
that
in eight years.

36:00.709 --> 36:03.125
And that's why
your bag is packed.

36:03.208 --> 36:04.709
I have to go to her.

36:08.291 --> 36:13.041
My parents spent
a zillion dollars on this
thing.

36:13.125 --> 36:15.166
Every loved one I have is here.

36:16.500 --> 36:19.583
And you're leaving
in the 25th hour

36:19.667 --> 36:23.041
for a girl who's been gone
for eight years?

36:23.125 --> 36:24.500
You must be crazy.

36:25.750 --> 36:27.667
I'm sorry.

36:27.750 --> 36:31.417
Just...get your ass
out the door.

36:42.333 --> 36:44.125
Not a graceful goodbye.

36:44.208 --> 36:45.583
I could see doing worse.

36:45.667 --> 36:46.875
But I didn't.

36:48.208 --> 36:49.500
And actually..

36:51.208 --> 36:52.542
...I understand now.

36:54.583 --> 36:55.709
He loved her.

36:58.417 --> 36:59.375
He loved her.

36:59.458 --> 37:01.291
And he wanted to love Anna

37:01.375 --> 37:02.709
who looked just like her?

37:02.792 --> 37:04.709
He was trying to get it back.

37:04.792 --> 37:05.792
Right.

37:05.875 --> 37:08.125
I knew the second
I saw Anna..

37:08.208 --> 37:09.667
...he was never gonna
go through with it.

37:09.750 --> 37:11.458
So he headed to Baltimore?

37:11.542 --> 37:12.959
With Phil.

37:13.041 --> 37:14.375
Best man to the end.

37:16.417 --> 37:18.750
More credit card research, Phil.

37:18.834 --> 37:19.792
Is that right?

37:19.875 --> 37:21.667
Two Amtrak tickets
to Baltimore.

37:21.750 --> 37:24.500
Purchased in the wee
hours,
night Dan hit the dirt.

37:24.583 --> 37:26.250
Well, sounds like
you were gonna hightail
it

37:26.333 --> 37:27.458
with the runaway groom.

37:27.542 --> 37:28.792
Makes you the last to see.

37:29.917 --> 37:32.458
I told you, I tried
to reason with Dan--

37:32.542 --> 37:35.834
You tell us things, Phil,
but you don't.

37:35.917 --> 37:38.000
Like you say, there was
an accident in Cancun

37:38.083 --> 37:39.959
but you don't say
that you were there.

37:41.458 --> 37:44.333
At the wheel of the boat,
as a matter of fact.

37:47.458 --> 37:49.166
That's not
something
you wanna relive.

37:50.333 --> 37:51.792
Wrecking a girl's life.

37:56.250 --> 37:57.542
And your best friend's.

38:00.333 --> 38:03.583
In fact, you'd do a lot
to never talk about it
again.

38:03.667 --> 38:06.125
Another half-truth
I'm stumbling on, Phil?

38:06.208 --> 38:08.291
- You told us about Melanie.
- Finally.

38:08.375 --> 38:10.959
(Stillman)
'But not that
you called her that night.'

38:12.375 --> 38:13.709
3:11 a.m.

38:15.458 --> 38:16.500
You called the hospital.

38:16.583 --> 38:18.333
Four minutes later,
Dan is dead.

38:19.750 --> 38:22.291
But you had a key
to the hotel room.

38:23.333 --> 38:24.500
You were with him.

38:24.583 --> 38:26.083
(Stillman)
'Calling his old girl.'

38:26.166 --> 38:27.333
Why?

38:31.125 --> 38:33.792
I've been asking myself
that same question ever
since.

38:40.625 --> 38:42.041
You don't wanna do this.

38:42.125 --> 38:44.625
[chuckles
]
I don't?

38:44.709 --> 38:47.000
New chapter, right?

38:47.083 --> 38:49.375
I don't wanna see Melanie
after eight years?

38:49.458 --> 38:50.875
Dan, she's gone.

38:52.000 --> 38:53.542
She asked for me.

38:53.625 --> 38:55.375
We both visited all those years.

38:55.458 --> 38:56.458
She never knew you.

38:56.542 --> 38:59.917
And-and...now she does.

39:00.000 --> 39:01.333
I don't believe that.

39:01.417 --> 39:04.792
So, move on, right?

39:04.875 --> 39:06.792
Even though she's
all
I ever wanted?

39:06.875 --> 39:08.458
But you can't have her.

39:08.542 --> 39:10.166
And whose fault is that?

39:12.917 --> 39:14.333
You know I'm sorry.

39:14.417 --> 39:15.709
But we can't bring her back.

39:15.792 --> 39:18.250
She is back.
She said my name.

39:18.333 --> 39:20.333
Dan, you heard the
doc.
This is not possible.

39:20.417 --> 39:23.250
- A nurse called me.
- Dan, face it.

39:23.333 --> 39:25.917
There is nothing
for you in
Baltimore.

39:28.667 --> 39:30.208
I guess I'm going alone then.

39:30.291 --> 39:31.917
Okay, you know what?

39:32.000 --> 39:34.291
- Let's call her.
- 'What are you doing?'

39:34.375 --> 39:36.083
No, let's see if she suddenly
remembers you, Dan.

39:36.166 --> 39:38.458
Let's see if Melanie
miraculously returned

39:38.542 --> 39:39.959
from her eight-year wasteland.

39:47.625 --> 39:48.667
Hello.

39:51.208 --> 39:52.834
Yeah, it's-it's Dan Palmer.

39:52.917 --> 39:54.417
We-we talked earlier.

39:56.125 --> 39:57.542
How is she?

40:07.041 --> 40:08.208
Yeah.

40:09.834 --> 40:10.875
Thanks.

40:16.083 --> 40:17.583
You-you're right.

40:20.458 --> 40:22.041
We're not going to Baltimore.

40:24.417 --> 40:25.834
Look, I'll..

40:25.917 --> 40:28.333
I'll order us some coffee.
We-we'll talk.

40:28.417 --> 40:31.041
We'll-we'll get things
back on track.

40:44.458 --> 40:45.834
Dan, what are you doing?

40:50.875 --> 40:53.542
- She died.
- What?

40:53.625 --> 40:56.458
They say it happens sometimes
right before death.

40:58.875 --> 41:00.500
- Clarity.
- Dan.

41:02.917 --> 41:04.208
Clarity.

41:05.625 --> 41:07.542
Wait, Dan, Dan.

41:07.625 --> 41:08.667
No!
