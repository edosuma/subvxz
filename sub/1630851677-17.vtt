what "Pembroke" means?

six years.

10:42.729 --> 10:43.991
After CRISPR

Dr. Jarrahi was one
of the first researchers

10:45.775 --> 10:47.211
to start working
with it.

disappearance?

10:53.000 --> 10:55.089
Jarrahi received some
funding from sources

10:55.132 --> 10:56.656
with ties to the
Iranian military.

10:56.699 --> 10:58.527
ONI thought she could
help us glean

10:58.570 --> 11:00.660
whether Iran is trying
to develop genetic weapons.

11:00.703 --> 11:03.271
Genetic weapons?
What is that?

11:03.314 --> 11:06.535
Genetic tools like CRISPR target
specific sections of DNA.

11:06.578 --> 11:08.624
Theoretically,
you could distribute

11:08.668 --> 11:10.104
an inert virus
programmed

11:10.147 --> 11:12.149
to only attack someone with
a specific genetic sequence,

11:12.193 --> 11:13.977
or a family,

11:14.021 --> 11:16.371
or a whole race
of people.

11:16.414 --> 11:18.678
My God.Exactly.

11:18.721 --> 11:20.680
What kind of intel did Varza get
from Dr. Jarrahi?

11:20.723 --> 11:22.246
Nothing yet.

11:22.290 --> 11:23.726
She'd just been
establishing a rapport,

11:23.770 --> 11:26.468
but Varza had dinner
with Dr. Jarrahi

11:26.511 --> 11:27.687
at a restaurant last night
where she hoped

11:27.730 --> 11:29.036
to make
an official overture.

11:29.079 --> 11:30.646
I was hoping your office
could get access

11:30.690 --> 11:31.647
to the restaurant'scameras.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.301
Yeah, absolutely.

11:33.344 --> 11:35.782
I was expecting an update
from her this morning.

11:35.825 --> 11:37.522
When it didn't come,
I called.

11:37.566 --> 11:39.742
When I didn't get an answer,
I went to her house.

11:39.786 --> 11:42.876
The front door was unlocked,
but Varza was gone.

11:42.919 --> 11:44.094
KENSI:You said Dr. Jarrahi

11:44.138 --> 11:45.705
was receiving funding
from people

11:45.748 --> 11:47.445
with ties to the
Iranian military.

11:47.489 --> 11:49.230
I think we need to consider
the possibility

11:49.273 --> 11:52.059
that she has stronger
connections than that.

11:52.102 --> 11:55.279
Maybe Jarrahi was
already collected,

11:55.323 --> 11:57.238
just not by us.

11:57.281 --> 11:59.066
[gunshots]

12:02.156 --> 12:04.375
[door closes]

12:04.419 --> 12:06.900
Didn't expect
to see you again so soon.

12:06.943 --> 12:08.336
How you doing, Nate?

12:08.379 --> 12:11.165
I'm good. How are you?

12:11.208 --> 12:13.471
[chuckles] Pretty sure
we covered that last week.

12:13.515 --> 12:14.559
A lot can change in a week.

12:14.603 --> 12:16.561
I'm doing all
right, Nate.

12:16.605 --> 12:19.129
I'm dealing with it.

12:19.173 --> 12:20.957
I can see that.

12:22.002 --> 12:23.394
So is this gonna be
a regular thing now,

12:23.438 --> 12:24.918
you checking up on me?

12:24.961 --> 12:26.746
Callen, if you don't want
to talk about Katya,

12:26.789 --> 12:28.095
you don't have to.

12:28.138 --> 12:30.837
I don't want to talk
about Katya.

12:30.880 --> 12:32.795
I want to stop Katya.

12:34.362 --> 12:35.711
Maybe I can help with that.

12:35.755 --> 12:38.583
I've been studying Katya,

12:38.627 --> 12:40.150
and I've drawn up
a psych profile.

12:40.194 --> 12:41.804
Yeah, well, so has
the FBI and the CIA.

12:41.848 --> 12:43.153
I don't need to read
another one to know that

12:43.197 --> 12:44.720
she's a sadist
driven by revenge.

12:44.764 --> 12:46.591
Except they got it wrong.

12:46.635 --> 12:48.680
She's not driven by revenge.

12:48.724 --> 12:50.378
She's driven by obsession.

12:50.421 --> 12:53.468
When one plays out, she just
hops on board another one.

12:53.511 --> 12:54.817
Look, think about it.

12:54.861 --> 12:57.733
First it was Anna.
Now it's you.

12:57.777 --> 12:59.909
Now, I think if we can
identify a new obsession,

12:59.953 --> 13:01.868
we might be able to draw
her out, or at least

13:01.911 --> 13:03.130
get her to stop harassing you.

13:03.173 --> 13:04.740
What about an old obsession?

13:04.784 --> 13:06.350
Possibly.

13:06.394 --> 13:08.135
If you could reignite it. Why?

13:08.178 --> 13:10.311
'Cause I think I found one.

13:10.354 --> 13:12.530
Only you're... you're
gonna think I'm crazy.

13:12.574 --> 13:14.532
I don't like that word.

13:14.576 --> 13:16.621
Try me.

13:18.232 --> 13:19.799
SAM:
No signs of a struggle.

13:19.842 --> 13:21.583
No signs of
a break-in either.

13:21.626 --> 13:24.151
Yeah, well, Ali did say
the front door was unlocked.

13:24.194 --> 13:25.979
Yeah. Well, I found
Varza's keys,

13:26.022 --> 13:27.807
so whoever took her didn't
bother locking up behind them.

13:27.850 --> 13:29.112
Yeah, if someone
took her.

13:30.635 --> 13:32.550
You think she ran?

13:32.594 --> 13:33.551
Didn't rule it out yet.

13:34.683 --> 13:36.511
You talk to Callen?

13:36.554 --> 13:37.904
Yup.

13:37.947 --> 13:39.862
And how's he doing?

13:39.906 --> 13:42.430
Says he's fine.You believe him?

13:42.473 --> 13:43.953
No.[chuckles]

13:45.868 --> 13:48.479
Ali also said
Varza had a computer.

13:48.523 --> 13:50.133
Haven't found one anywhere.

13:50.177 --> 13:52.353
Well, couldn't find a cell
phone anywhere either.

13:53.963 --> 13:55.443
Rountree,

13:55.486 --> 13:56.661
you get a trace
on Varza's phone yet?

13:56.705 --> 13:58.620
Negative. It's still turned off,

13:58.663 --> 14:01.231
but I was able to gain access
to her security system.

14:01.275 --> 14:03.320
She only has exterior cameras.

14:03.364 --> 14:05.670
They show her pulling into
the garage 25 minutes

14:05.714 --> 14:07.890
after she left the restaurant.
But then-- get this--

14:07.934 --> 14:11.024
the system was deactivated
at 2:14 on site.

14:11.067 --> 14:13.200
So far, no indication
it was hacked.

14:13.243 --> 14:15.028
Start digging
into Varza's records.

14:15.071 --> 14:17.465
See if she had a motive to sell
intel or flee the country.

14:17.508 --> 14:18.422
You got it.

14:18.466 --> 14:20.381
Okay, so

14:20.424 --> 14:22.905
whoever was involved
in Varza's disappearance--

14:22.949 --> 14:24.820
potentially
Varza herself--

14:24.864 --> 14:26.300
didn't leave us
any witnesses,

14:26.343 --> 14:28.258
didn't leave us
any physical evidence,

14:28.302 --> 14:30.521
turned off all the cameras
and took all the computers.

14:33.829 --> 14:35.439
Not all the computers.

14:50.237 --> 14:51.847
So, you've heard
that voice before?

14:51.891 --> 14:53.240
Yes.When you were a boy

14:53.283 --> 14:54.458
in Hetty's training program?

14:54.502 --> 14:56.199
Correct.Which means that

14:56.243 --> 14:59.681
the man from this
KGB Noble Maiden film...

14:59.724 --> 15:02.162
Was also involved
in the CIA's Drona Project.

15:02.205 --> 15:04.033
Look,

15:04.077 --> 15:06.949
Katya may be driven
by obsessions,

15:06.993 --> 15:09.212
but her obsessions
lead to revenge.

15:09.256 --> 15:11.084
I think she was
hunting down this guy

15:11.127 --> 15:12.737
when she was embedded here
as a spy.

15:12.781 --> 15:14.478
This film reel
was her only lead.

15:14.522 --> 15:16.524
[sighs]

15:16.567 --> 15:17.873
You think I'm crazy.

15:17.917 --> 15:18.874
I don't like that word.

15:18.918 --> 15:20.876
Fine. Delusional.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.660
Let me put it to you
like this, look,

15:22.704 --> 15:25.446
is it more likely that your mind
is fabricating this

15:25.489 --> 15:27.709
aural connection based on
perceived parallels

15:27.752 --> 15:29.493
between yours
and Katya's upbringing?

15:29.537 --> 15:31.800
Yes. [scoffs]

15:31.843 --> 15:33.976
But is it impossible
that this...

15:34.020 --> 15:36.979
instructor is someone
who worked in both worlds?

15:37.023 --> 15:38.807
The CIA and KGB
actively recruited

15:38.850 --> 15:40.896
from one another during
the Cold War. They stole

15:40.940 --> 15:44.378
technology, tradecraft,
even training.

15:44.421 --> 15:46.554
Add to the fact that the...
that the Drona Project

15:46.597 --> 15:48.686
is based on a Soviet program,
no, no,

15:48.730 --> 15:51.167
it's definitely not impossible.Wait.

15:51.211 --> 15:53.953
How do you know Drona is
based on a Soviet program?

15:53.996 --> 15:55.084
Admiral Kilbride told me.

15:57.043 --> 15:59.132
Wait, he didn't tell you that?No.

15:59.175 --> 16:01.308
Why wouldn't he tell you that?Well, it might have
to do with the fact

16:01.351 --> 16:03.136
that I broke into
some sealed archives

16:03.179 --> 16:04.354
and he threatened to fire me.

16:05.790 --> 16:07.357
But...

16:07.401 --> 16:09.490
I'm already
halfway out the door.

16:09.533 --> 16:11.100
Might as well see
what else he knows.

16:13.668 --> 16:15.278
Yeah, this is gonna go well.

16:15.322 --> 16:17.193
So, how do I look?

16:17.237 --> 16:19.891
Uh... cool.

16:19.935 --> 16:22.024
I think. I don't...
really know.

16:22.068 --> 16:24.026
I don't spend a lot of time
around undergrads.

16:24.070 --> 16:25.767
Yeah, I'd be worried if you did.

16:25.810 --> 16:27.812
Right. Uh...[chuckles]

16:27.856 --> 16:30.380
Here's your school ID.

16:30.424 --> 16:32.121
Dr. Jarrahi
normally eats lunch

16:32.165 --> 16:34.210
at the school cafeteria
every day at 12:30,

16:34.254 --> 16:37.300
but...But she's currently observing
the fast for Ramadan, as am I.

16:37.344 --> 16:38.780
Another thing
we can bond over.

16:38.823 --> 16:41.174
That makes three of us.

16:41.217 --> 16:43.611
I'm also fasting,

16:43.654 --> 16:45.004
and I started going
to the mosque.

16:45.047 --> 16:47.049
Oh, I'm glad to hear it.

16:47.093 --> 16:48.790
I was actually
wondering if you had

16:48.833 --> 16:50.400
any plans for Eid?

16:50.444 --> 16:52.663
Oh, I, uh...

16:52.707 --> 16:55.014
usually just do something
with my family.

16:55.057 --> 16:57.233
Right, yeah,
of course.

16:57.277 --> 16:58.626
Hey.

16:58.669 --> 17:00.062
Hey.

17:00.106 --> 17:01.542
You, uh, got anything on Varza?

17:01.585 --> 17:04.066
I checked her bank accounts,
e-mails, calls.

17:04.110 --> 17:05.807
Nothing indicates
she was planning on

17:05.850 --> 17:08.462
selling classified
information, and after what

17:08.505 --> 17:11.073
Sam and Kensi found
on the data log in Varza's car,

17:11.117 --> 17:13.206
safe to say she was
definitely kidnapped.

17:14.816 --> 17:16.035
Her trunk was
opened and closed

17:16.078 --> 17:17.862
at 8:16 last night

17:17.906 --> 17:19.429
outside the restaurant where
she was dining with Jarrahi.

17:19.473 --> 17:22.215
And then it opened and closed
again at 2:08 a.m.

17:22.258 --> 17:24.043
while it was parked
in her garage.

17:24.086 --> 17:26.828
Six minutes before
her security system went down.

17:26.871 --> 17:28.830
Varza's kidnappers
didn't have to break in.

17:28.873 --> 17:30.179
They were driven in.

17:30.223 --> 17:33.008
They were hiding
in the trunk of her car.

17:39.319 --> 17:42.670
If you're hoping to purge
your memory of that voicemail

17:42.713 --> 17:45.847
by another session
of gun range therapy,

17:45.890 --> 17:47.805
I'm afraid I've already

17:47.849 --> 17:48.850
reserved it
for that very purpose.

17:48.893 --> 17:50.286
CALLEN:
You told Nate

17:50.330 --> 17:51.679
the Drona Project
was based on a program

17:51.722 --> 17:53.855
that was started by the Soviets.

17:53.898 --> 17:56.075
Was that program
the Institute for Noble Maidens?

17:58.120 --> 18:00.296
That was a confidential
conversation

18:00.340 --> 18:02.081
between me and Dr. Getz.

18:02.124 --> 18:03.952
With all due
respect, Admiral,

18:03.995 --> 18:07.173
confidentiality only applies
to doctor-patient conversations,

18:07.216 --> 18:09.044
not work-related
conversations.

18:09.088 --> 18:10.872
How about classified ones?

18:10.915 --> 18:12.874
Admiral, you asked me
here to help Callen.

18:12.917 --> 18:15.181
Remind me never
to do that again.

18:15.224 --> 18:17.270
This isn't about me.
This is about Katya.

18:18.880 --> 18:20.447
I think when she was in L.A.
working as a spy,

18:20.490 --> 18:22.275
she was looking for somebody
from the Drona Project.

18:22.318 --> 18:24.712
And why the hell
would you think that?

18:24.755 --> 18:26.975
Because I recognize
the instructor's voice

18:27.018 --> 18:28.107
from the Noble Maiden film.

18:29.760 --> 18:32.154
I think he worked on Drona, too.

18:32.198 --> 18:33.938
Do you have any idea
how crazy you sound?

18:33.982 --> 18:36.289
[groans]He really doesn't
like that word.

18:36.332 --> 18:38.291
Look, Admiral,Excuse me? What...

18:38.334 --> 18:40.989
I am trying
to stop the deepfakes.

18:42.991 --> 18:45.124
Was the Drona Project based

18:45.167 --> 18:46.690
on the Institute
for Noble Maidens?

18:53.480 --> 18:54.263
Yes.

18:56.178 --> 18:58.876
And what about Pembroke?

18:58.920 --> 19:00.139
Does that name
mean anything to you?

19:01.401 --> 19:03.272
No.
That's all that Hetty told me.

19:04.882 --> 19:05.927
Thank you.

19:09.235 --> 19:10.975
Do you not understand

19:11.019 --> 19:13.369
what is happening here?

19:13.413 --> 19:15.980
He's seeing connections
that aren't there.

19:16.024 --> 19:17.504
He's falling down a rabbit hole,

19:17.547 --> 19:19.158
and instead of pulling him out,

19:19.201 --> 19:20.507
you're leading him in deeper.

19:20.550 --> 19:22.335
You know, that
may be true, Admiral,

19:22.378 --> 19:25.468
but I've known Callen
a lot longer than you have.

19:25.512 --> 19:27.340
With or without me,

19:27.383 --> 19:29.864
he's gonna see
this thing through.

19:29.907 --> 19:31.170
Wherever it may lead.

19:55.063 --> 19:57.370
Aren't you Dr. Roxana Jarrahi?

19:57.413 --> 19:59.023
That's right. And you are?

19:59.067 --> 20:01.722
[chuckles] Fatima Khadem.
Can I sit?

20:01.765 --> 20:04.203
Apparently, you can.Sorry, I'm just...

20:04.246 --> 20:06.596
I'm so excited to meet
another Iranian scientist.

20:06.640 --> 20:08.816
I'm graduating next month,
and I'm actually waitlisted

20:08.859 --> 20:10.992
for the graduate program
in biochemistry.

20:11.035 --> 20:13.255
I have no sway over admissions.
If you don't get in this year,

20:13.299 --> 20:15.083
there is always
next year.

20:15.126 --> 20:16.127
ALI [over comms]:
Jarrahi's a workaholic.

20:16.171 --> 20:17.607
Focus on her research.

20:17.651 --> 20:18.739
FATIMA:
I know. That's...

20:18.782 --> 20:20.262
not actually
why I'm here.

20:20.306 --> 20:22.264
I've been following
your work for years.

20:22.308 --> 20:24.266
I just think there are
so many real-world,

20:24.310 --> 20:26.268
viable applications
for your research,

20:26.312 --> 20:28.662
but it's still in the
testing phase-- why is that?

20:28.705 --> 20:30.577
I mean, like your
mosquito gene drive.

20:30.620 --> 20:32.796
Like, that could save
millions of lives.

20:32.840 --> 20:34.407
What's holding it up?

20:34.450 --> 20:37.018
In a word: fear.

20:37.061 --> 20:39.063
Well, maybe if people
could see the results...

20:39.107 --> 20:40.978
Let me stop you.
You seem like

20:41.022 --> 20:43.067
an eager and
enthusiastic student,

20:43.111 --> 20:44.895
and I am sorry
you weren't admitted,

20:44.939 --> 20:46.897
but I have a lot
of work to do,

20:46.941 --> 20:48.769
and I'm sure
you do, too.

20:48.812 --> 20:51.337
Plan B. Wealthy parents
want to fund her research.

20:51.380 --> 20:52.338
Sorry to bother you.

20:55.863 --> 20:57.473
No. What are you doing?

21:05.133 --> 21:06.308
[Iranian pop song playing]

21:07.353 --> 21:08.397
Oh...

21:10.138 --> 21:11.400
These things, like,
never sync up.

21:13.533 --> 21:16.405
You listen to Googoosh?Oh, yeah, she's amazing.

21:16.449 --> 21:18.320
It's kind of retro, I know, but

21:18.364 --> 21:21.149
I love her. I'm actually gonna
see her at the Bowl this summer.

21:21.192 --> 21:23.325
Me, too. I just
bought tickets last week.

21:23.369 --> 21:26.459
Not surprised. Pretty sure half
of Tehrangeles will be there.Mm.

21:26.502 --> 21:29.157
I just hope she plays
"Gharibe Ashena."

21:29.200 --> 21:30.898
Oh, please, she has to.

21:30.941 --> 21:33.596
If she doesn't,
the-the crowd will revolt.

21:33.640 --> 21:34.945
Yeah, and I'll be
the one leading them.

21:36.730 --> 21:38.601
What made you interested
in my work?

21:41.691 --> 21:43.519
FATIMA:
Well, so my parents moved here

21:43.563 --> 21:45.956
during the Revolution,
and both of them are doctors.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.045
These are the files
on the Drona subjects.

21:48.089 --> 21:49.656
I haven't been able to
ID very many of them,

21:49.699 --> 21:51.484
but the ones I have,
most of them are dead.

21:51.527 --> 21:53.137
One of them
died in action.

21:53.181 --> 21:54.400
One of them was killed
in the line of fire.

21:54.443 --> 21:55.662
Two of them by suicide.

21:55.705 --> 21:58.099
The only one who is alive

21:58.142 --> 22:00.710
is her.

22:00.754 --> 22:02.146
Leah Novak.

22:02.190 --> 22:03.757
She lives in L.A.
Have you spoken to her?

22:03.800 --> 22:05.454
I have.Did you ask her

22:05.498 --> 22:06.934
her if she recognizes the voice
from the film reel?

22:06.977 --> 22:08.544
No.Why not?

22:08.588 --> 22:10.285
Mm...

22:10.329 --> 22:12.548
It's complicated.

22:13.941 --> 22:15.464
KENSI:
Hey.

22:15.508 --> 22:16.465
Got your text.
When'd you get here?

22:16.509 --> 22:18.337
Uh, like, 20 minutes ago.

22:18.380 --> 22:19.903
I was just catching up
on the Varza case.

22:19.947 --> 22:20.904
Where's Sam?

22:20.948 --> 22:22.341
Oh, he dropped me off

22:22.384 --> 22:23.733
and now he's headed
to the university

22:23.777 --> 22:25.953
to provide backup
for Fatima and Ali, but, um...

22:25.996 --> 22:27.694
so, what happened with Pilar's
case manager and your friend?

22:27.737 --> 22:28.521
What did they say?

22:30.610 --> 22:32.786
They said a lot, actually.
There's a lot to go through,

22:32.829 --> 22:35.310
and I certainly don't regret
this career change.

22:35.354 --> 22:36.703
So?

22:36.746 --> 22:38.966
So, um...

22:39.009 --> 22:40.881
Pilar's parents were murdered

22:40.924 --> 22:42.839
by a gang in Guatemala.

22:42.883 --> 22:43.840
Yeah.

22:43.884 --> 22:45.712
And, um...

22:45.755 --> 22:47.540
and they threatened
to kill her, too,

22:47.583 --> 22:50.107
and so, last month,
she fled here by herself.

22:50.151 --> 22:51.413
Oh, my God.

22:51.457 --> 22:53.328
The good news
is they think that

22:53.372 --> 22:54.808
she has a really strong case
for asylum.

22:54.851 --> 22:56.375
Okay, well, that's good,
and is there anything

22:56.418 --> 22:57.898
that you and I can do
in the meantime?

22:57.941 --> 22:59.682
My friend is helping her
with the application for asylum,

22:59.726 --> 23:01.510
and he said that
it would be good for us

23:01.554 --> 23:03.512
to find someone
for her to talk to.Yeah.

23:03.556 --> 23:04.905
Just that because
she's been through

23:04.948 --> 23:06.907
this traumatic event, that...

23:06.950 --> 23:08.474
the more she's able
to speak about it,

23:08.517 --> 23:11.085
obviously, the better
her chances are.

23:11.128 --> 23:12.913
Right. Um...

23:12.956 --> 23:14.697
I mean, we can put her
in contact with Nate, maybe,

23:14.741 --> 23:16.569
or he can recommend
someone else she can talk to.

23:16.612 --> 23:18.527
Nate is a great idea.ROUNTREE: Hey, guys.

23:18.571 --> 23:20.442
So, I found
something interesting

23:20.486 --> 23:22.923
on the security cam footage
from the restaurant last night.

23:22.966 --> 23:25.839
Varza and Jarrahi,
they enter at 8:00 p.m.,

23:25.882 --> 23:27.449
followed by these two guys.

23:27.493 --> 23:29.973
15 minutes later,
one of them leaves

23:30.017 --> 23:31.322
and never returns.

23:31.366 --> 23:33.150
The timecode matches
the same time

23:33.194 --> 23:34.848
that Varza's trunk
was opened.

23:34.891 --> 23:37.503
Huh. The other one stayed
inside to keep an eye on Varza

23:37.546 --> 23:39.461
while his buddy
broke into her car.

23:39.505 --> 23:40.810
I'm guessing
he follows her out

23:40.854 --> 23:42.377
after she leaves.ROUNTREE: Yeah, but, first,

23:42.421 --> 23:44.205
Jarrahi leaves
very quickly.

23:44.248 --> 23:46.729
Followed by Varza and then
our second mystery man,

23:46.773 --> 23:48.165
So, who are these guys?

23:48.209 --> 23:49.993
No idea.
I mean, I ran

23:50.037 --> 23:53.388
their faces through facial rec,
all the databases.

23:53.432 --> 23:54.563
It's like they don't exist.

23:56.130 --> 23:58.306
In hindsight, it wasn't
the best approach.

23:58.349 --> 24:00.874
I just don't get it.
Leah wasn't a suspect,

24:00.917 --> 24:02.789
she was a subject like you.
Why would you lie to her?

24:02.832 --> 24:04.660
Because she was
Homeland Security

24:04.704 --> 24:05.879
and her file had been redacted,
which lead me to believe

24:05.922 --> 24:07.315
that she didn't want
to be found.

24:07.358 --> 24:08.969
I just felt that
an indirect approach

24:09.012 --> 24:10.927
would be the most
productive.

24:10.971 --> 24:12.929
I also think you could've tried
a little harder with your alias.

24:12.973 --> 24:15.802
I mean, Greg? It's basically
the English version of Grisha.

24:15.845 --> 24:17.499
And what about Drona--

24:17.543 --> 24:19.501
does she remember
being a part of it?

24:19.545 --> 24:20.981
CALLEN:
I don't know.
We had dinner a few times.

24:21.024 --> 24:22.199
I tried to ask her
about her childhood,

24:22.243 --> 24:23.200
but then I had to cut it off.

24:23.244 --> 24:25.420
NATE:
Why?

24:25.464 --> 24:26.900
Oh. [knock on door]

24:28.945 --> 24:31.034
Greg. What are you doing here?

24:31.078 --> 24:32.471
And who's this?

24:34.821 --> 24:35.822
We need to talk.

24:46.876 --> 24:48.704
I don't know
if I've heard him before.

24:48.748 --> 24:50.706
I don't speak Russian.

24:50.750 --> 24:53.709
He's saying that, uh,

24:53.753 --> 24:57.321
pain is just a state of mind.

24:57.365 --> 24:58.671
That doesn't ring a bell
for you?

24:58.714 --> 25:01.325
Do I remember going to some
special school

25:01.369 --> 25:03.502
when I was younger? Yes.

25:03.545 --> 25:05.678
That's because I had ADD.

25:05.721 --> 25:07.941
No one talked about pain
being a state of mind.

25:09.856 --> 25:12.380
This is why you lied to me?

25:14.774 --> 25:16.906
You have to understand that
in Agent Callen's line of work,

25:16.950 --> 25:19.909
trusting others
can be dangerous.

25:19.953 --> 25:23.565
I work in cyberspace, Dr. Getz.

25:23.609 --> 25:26.742
You don't need to tell me
that people are liars.

25:26.786 --> 25:28.570
I'd like you both
to leave now.

25:32.356 --> 25:33.967
Callen.

25:34.010 --> 25:36.186
Does the name Pembroke
mean anything to you?

25:38.754 --> 25:40.930
Go to hell, Greg.

25:40.974 --> 25:43.193
Or whatever your name is.

25:55.597 --> 25:57.556
Did they have
fewer CAG repeats?

25:57.599 --> 25:59.558
That can often mean that
symptoms go unnoticed

25:59.601 --> 26:01.777
prior to death.

26:01.821 --> 26:04.606
You send the photo of
our two mystery men to ONI?

26:04.650 --> 26:05.955
Yeah. We've got
nothing on them.

26:05.999 --> 26:07.957
You know what that means.

26:08.001 --> 26:09.872
Most likely Iranian
intelligence agents.

26:09.916 --> 26:11.395
Non-official covers.

26:11.439 --> 26:12.962
Except these guys
have no cover.

26:13.006 --> 26:14.573
They're untraceable.

26:14.616 --> 26:16.749
It's not looking good
for finding Varza.

26:16.792 --> 26:17.706
JARRAHI [over comms]:
I wish we could make faster

26:17.750 --> 26:19.403
progress.

26:19.447 --> 26:20.187
SAM:
Fatima, I need you
to accelerate.

26:20.230 --> 26:21.623
Push her on Varza.

26:21.667 --> 26:24.365
Agreed.
So, uh, five months in L.A.

26:24.408 --> 26:25.758
How do you like it so far?

26:25.801 --> 26:29.196
Hmm, no idea.
I work all the time.

26:29.239 --> 26:30.632
I've barely left the campus.

26:30.676 --> 26:32.547
I haven't even seen
the ocean yet.

26:32.591 --> 26:35.376
No way. You have
any friends?

26:35.419 --> 26:38.205
I have a cat,
but she's not very friendly.

26:40.033 --> 26:42.513
Have you met any other
Iranian expats here?

26:42.557 --> 26:44.167
'Cause there's a lot of us.

26:44.211 --> 26:45.952
No. Not really.

26:45.995 --> 26:47.040
ALI [over comms]:
That's a lie.

26:47.083 --> 26:48.781
Varza's cover story was that

26:48.824 --> 26:51.000
she was a pharmaceutical
businesswoman from Tehran.

26:51.044 --> 26:52.436
FATIMA:
I read this article about

26:52.480 --> 26:53.829
an L.A. businesswoman
from Tehran.

26:53.873 --> 26:56.179
She works in
pharmaceuticals.

26:56.223 --> 26:58.138
She actually wants to use
CRISPR to create new drugs.

26:58.181 --> 27:00.444
I bet you she'd be really
fascinated in your work.

27:00.488 --> 27:03.317
You know of her?Who are you?

27:03.360 --> 27:04.840
What?

27:07.103 --> 27:08.627
SAM:
Fatima, the two guys

27:08.670 --> 27:10.280
who snatched Varza
are headed your way.

27:10.324 --> 27:11.717
I have to go.

27:11.760 --> 27:13.066
Wait, did-did
I say something wrong?

27:13.109 --> 27:14.458
Stay away from me!

27:14.502 --> 27:15.416
SAM:
Let her go. Let her go.

27:15.459 --> 27:16.591
See if they follow her.

27:19.594 --> 27:21.814
They're staying
with Fatima.

27:21.857 --> 27:23.642
Follow Jarrahi.
Once you're clear,

27:23.685 --> 27:24.947
ID yourself
and escort her to safety.

27:24.991 --> 27:26.645
What about these guys?We've got 'em covered.

27:31.214 --> 27:32.215
[car lock chirps]

27:32.259 --> 27:33.564
Hey.

27:33.608 --> 27:34.696
Can I help you?

27:36.698 --> 27:38.700
Or you?

27:38.744 --> 27:40.310
Come with us, please.

27:40.354 --> 27:41.616
That's funny, I was
gonna say the same thing.

27:41.660 --> 27:43.705
Federal agents.
Hands on your...

27:46.142 --> 27:47.404
[honks]

27:47.448 --> 27:48.841
[grunting]

27:52.279 --> 27:53.323
You should have kept running.

27:54.020 --> 27:56.065
ONI. Stop! [grunts]

28:00.896 --> 28:02.637
Where's Jarrahi?

28:02.681 --> 28:05.335
Campus security's watching her.
Thought maybe

28:05.379 --> 28:07.337
you could use
some help.This is how you help?

28:07.381 --> 28:08.774
By letting him crash into you?

28:08.817 --> 28:10.471
Does it look okay?

28:22.570 --> 28:26.269
Yes, Maria and I had dinner
last night, but I left early

28:26.313 --> 28:28.924
because of what she told me.What exactly did she say?

28:28.968 --> 28:31.927
That she was working for the
Office of Naval Intelligence

28:31.971 --> 28:34.974
and that she wanted
to recruit me to spy for them.

28:35.017 --> 28:38.238
Which is the most ridiculous
thing I have ever heard.

28:38.281 --> 28:40.762
I would have laughed
if I wasn't so angry.

28:40.806 --> 28:43.112
What kind of information
could I even provide?

28:43.156 --> 28:45.332
You've received funding
from people

28:45.375 --> 28:47.116
with ties
to the Iranian military.

28:47.160 --> 28:49.379
And we have intelligence
indicating your country is

28:49.423 --> 28:50.946
interested in developing
genetic weapons.

28:50.990 --> 28:53.340
Is that what you think I do?

28:53.383 --> 28:55.472
Doctor, you have
to understand,

28:55.516 --> 28:58.127
the tools you work with
are very powerful.

28:58.171 --> 29:01.348
I understand their power, Agent
Namazi, thank you very much.

29:01.391 --> 29:04.264
That is why I do not
do business with the military.

29:04.307 --> 29:06.179
Any military.
I wish I could

29:06.222 --> 29:09.095
help you find Maria,
but I can't.

29:09.138 --> 29:11.140
Am I free to go now?

29:11.184 --> 29:12.794
It may not be safe
for you to leave just yet.

29:12.838 --> 29:15.971
He's right. We need to find out
who these men are

29:16.015 --> 29:18.104
and what happened
to Officer Varza.

29:18.147 --> 29:20.759
KILBRIDE [over comms]:
I have an answer to
that first question.

29:20.802 --> 29:22.543
Will you, um,
get her settled upstairs?

29:22.586 --> 29:24.763
Doctor.Thank you, Doctor.

29:30.377 --> 29:31.987
Go ahead, Admiral.

29:32.031 --> 29:34.163
I spoke to the head
of the Middle East desk

29:34.207 --> 29:36.078
at the FBI field office.

29:36.122 --> 29:38.777
The two men you have
in custody are indeed

29:38.820 --> 29:41.823
Iranian intelligence agents.

29:41.867 --> 29:44.608
Now, Sam can keep trying,
but these guys are trained

29:44.652 --> 29:47.263
to die before they talk.

29:47.307 --> 29:49.831
I'm afraid we're gonna
have to find Varza another way.

29:49.875 --> 29:51.790
Understood.

29:53.661 --> 29:54.923
NATE:I was thinking maybe
I could take a look

29:54.967 --> 29:56.533
at some more of
those Drona files.

29:56.577 --> 29:57.926
CALLEN:
Sure. Have at it.

29:57.970 --> 29:59.841
Who knows, maybe
I'll find something

29:59.885 --> 30:02.801
that helps us identify
one of the subjects.

30:03.845 --> 30:06.630
Who knows?

30:06.674 --> 30:08.241
Look, Callen,
I-I know today was rough,

30:08.284 --> 30:09.764
and you probably feel like

30:09.808 --> 30:11.418
you're right back
where you started,

30:11.461 --> 30:14.551
but believe it or not,
you actually made some progress.

30:14.595 --> 30:17.032
Anna moved out.

30:17.076 --> 30:19.643
Well, technically,
we both moved out,

30:19.687 --> 30:22.385
but she's not gonna
be moving back in with me.

30:22.429 --> 30:25.040
I'm sorry, Callen.

30:25.084 --> 30:28.000
She says that
I'm obsessed about Katya.

30:28.043 --> 30:30.829
I'm starting to think
she may be right.

30:30.872 --> 30:33.962
Who knows,
I may be ruining my life

30:34.006 --> 30:36.138
more than Katya is.

30:36.182 --> 30:38.837
Well, that's the thing
about obsessions.

30:38.880 --> 30:40.839
The strongest ones
feed off each other.

30:40.882 --> 30:42.405
And Katya's obsessed with you,

30:42.449 --> 30:45.408
which makes you obsessed
with her and vice versa.

30:45.452 --> 30:46.670
So, what--
you're saying if I ignore her

30:46.714 --> 30:47.889
she's just gonna stop?

30:47.933 --> 30:49.499
No, probably not.

30:49.543 --> 30:52.111
I mean, you know,
Katya's unpredictable.

30:52.154 --> 30:53.852
She's driven by obsession,
but she's also sadistic,

30:53.895 --> 30:56.506
and she's totally,
just totally...

30:56.550 --> 30:58.421
You can say it.

31:00.467 --> 31:01.990
She's crazy, okay?

31:02.034 --> 31:05.472
She's pure, unfiltered,
bat poop crazy town.

31:05.515 --> 31:06.952
She... She's crazy.

31:06.995 --> 31:08.475
Feels pretty good, doesn't it?It does.

31:08.518 --> 31:10.477
It really does.Mm-hmm.

31:10.520 --> 31:12.435
Just don't tell anyone
I said it, please.[phone vibrates]

31:12.479 --> 31:14.742
I'm not gonna say a word.

31:15.743 --> 31:17.092
Leah.

31:17.136 --> 31:18.702
A few years ago, I reunited

31:18.746 --> 31:20.095
with one of my foster moms.

31:20.139 --> 31:22.054
She gave me some old things

31:22.097 --> 31:25.753
I'd left behind,
including some documents.

31:25.796 --> 31:27.450
One of them
is a Department of Education

31:27.494 --> 31:28.887
special ed enrollment form.

31:28.930 --> 31:31.063
They list an address
in Cypress Park.

31:31.106 --> 31:32.499
What's the address?

31:32.542 --> 31:34.457
I just texted you a photo
of the document.

31:34.501 --> 31:38.200
I hope you find what you're
looking for, Agent Callen.

31:38.244 --> 31:40.028
[beep]

31:41.073 --> 31:42.422
SAM:
They're not gonna talk.

31:42.465 --> 31:43.902
We need to backtrack
their movements

31:43.945 --> 31:46.687
for the past 24 hours.

31:46.730 --> 31:48.515
We may have a lead on Varza.Yeah,

31:48.558 --> 31:50.082
but it's a long shot.

31:50.125 --> 31:51.518
She's underselling it.
It's a sure thing.

31:51.561 --> 31:53.259
It's promising.It's solid gold.

31:53.302 --> 31:54.738
What is it?We were looking over

31:54.782 --> 31:56.262
Varza's files on Dr. Jarrahi,

31:56.305 --> 31:58.307
and it turns out that
one of her sources of funding

31:58.351 --> 32:00.222
is an Iranian-American
businessman.

32:00.266 --> 32:01.658
Reza Shaheen.

32:01.702 --> 32:03.399
He has a biochemical business
and he's

32:03.443 --> 32:05.227
close friends with several
Iranian army generals.

32:05.271 --> 32:07.229
Yeah, we ran digital forensics
on the cell phones

32:07.273 --> 32:09.362
you guys confiscated
from the intelligence agents.

32:09.405 --> 32:11.625
One of them called Shaheen
early this morning.

32:11.668 --> 32:12.756
Boom. Solid gold.

32:12.800 --> 32:14.497
Where's Shaheen now?

32:14.541 --> 32:16.238
Shaheen is in Abu Dhabi.
Hasn't been to Los Angeles

32:16.282 --> 32:17.326
in months.

32:17.370 --> 32:18.806
Like I said, it's a long shot.

32:18.849 --> 32:20.155
Wow. Riddle me this, Batgirl.

32:20.199 --> 32:22.070
Why would one of these guys
call Shaheen

32:22.114 --> 32:23.942
if he was not somehow involved?

32:23.985 --> 32:25.247
SAM:
Does Shaheen

32:25.291 --> 32:27.075
own property in L.A.?

32:27.119 --> 32:28.555
He's moving all of his business
out of California,

32:28.598 --> 32:29.991
but he still has one asset.

32:30.035 --> 32:32.515
It's a warehouse in Hawthorne.

32:32.559 --> 32:33.603
Send me the address.
Kensi, Deeks.

32:33.647 --> 32:35.692
Yep.We'll meet you there.

32:35.736 --> 32:38.260
[sighs] No answer.

32:38.304 --> 32:40.175
Does it look familiar?

32:43.048 --> 32:45.050
No.

32:47.052 --> 32:48.096
Let's take a look around back.

32:59.064 --> 33:00.935
MAN:
I'll be with you in a moment.

33:05.766 --> 33:07.550
Please feel free
to look around.

33:11.859 --> 33:13.817
We're having a sale
on lemon trees.

33:13.861 --> 33:15.515
50% off. If you buy one,

33:15.558 --> 33:17.604
I'll send you home
with a free begonia.

33:23.262 --> 33:25.655
Beautiful, aren't they?

33:25.699 --> 33:29.007
I've been shaping these trees
their whole lives.

33:29.050 --> 33:32.053
Ever since they were
little saplings.

33:36.057 --> 33:40.235
So, what can I help you
with today?

33:46.850 --> 33:49.636
Finish the job.

34:07.828 --> 34:11.179
I'm Arnold Baines
and this is my garden.

34:11.223 --> 34:13.268
Uh, Nate.

34:13.312 --> 34:15.183
And this is
my friend,

34:15.227 --> 34:16.706
Greg.

34:16.750 --> 34:18.708
Uh, he just moved,

34:18.752 --> 34:21.885
Hi.and is looking for some
plants to liven the place up.

34:21.929 --> 34:26.238
I suggested a peace lily or a
ficus, but that's just because

34:26.281 --> 34:28.588
those are the only two plants
I can name. [chuckles]

34:28.631 --> 34:29.589
You're not alone
in that respect.

34:29.632 --> 34:32.070
The world is flora-illiterate.

34:32.113 --> 34:33.419
If I had my way,
they'd teach botany

34:33.462 --> 34:35.899
starting in elementary school.

34:35.943 --> 34:37.249
We'd give every kid a lily,

34:37.292 --> 34:39.294
let them nurture it
with water and sun

34:39.338 --> 34:40.861
and then take it away

34:40.904 --> 34:43.342
and let them watch it
wither and die.

34:43.385 --> 34:46.649
That sounds pretty intense
for elementary school kids.

34:46.693 --> 34:49.217
Eh, kids are more resilient
than we give them credit for.

34:49.261 --> 34:51.306
Besides, it's only
by understanding life

34:51.350 --> 34:53.091
that one comes to
truly respect it.

34:53.134 --> 34:55.267
Is that why you work
on bonsai trees?

34:56.964 --> 34:58.966
People have compared it
to foot binding.BAINES: Oh, no.

34:59.009 --> 35:02.709
Bonsai is not designed to stunt
growth but to encourage it.

35:02.752 --> 35:04.928
To stimulate the brain and, yes,

35:04.972 --> 35:07.844
even the soul of the trainer.

35:07.888 --> 35:10.630
And, my friend, if you're going
to speak on a subject,

35:10.673 --> 35:13.198
get the pronunciation right.
It's "bone-sigh."

35:13.241 --> 35:16.114
It's Japanese.
It's a beautiful language.

35:18.812 --> 35:20.292
Do you speak it?

35:20.335 --> 35:22.946
I did at one time,
but I'm out of practice.

35:30.040 --> 35:34.132
I'm sorry, was that, uh, Russian
that you were speaking?

35:40.138 --> 35:42.357
I'm afraid I don't
speak Russian.

35:44.359 --> 35:47.145
Just what I was looking for.

35:47.188 --> 35:48.363
Snake plant.

35:49.799 --> 35:52.498
One of the heartiest
household plants you can find.

35:52.541 --> 35:55.327
Doesn't need a lot of water,
doesn't need a lot of light.

35:56.502 --> 35:58.939
Just time.

36:02.508 --> 36:03.944
DEEKS:
Yo, maybe we missed something.

36:03.987 --> 36:05.206
Oh, let it go, babe.
It was a bust.

36:05.250 --> 36:06.816
Varza was never
at the warehouse.

36:06.860 --> 36:08.427
And I don't care
if he is in Abu Dhabi,

36:08.470 --> 36:11.343
Shaheen had something to do
with this, he has to.

36:11.386 --> 36:12.996
I know the SAC at the
Middle East field office.

36:13.040 --> 36:14.302
I'll call her, tell her
to bring in Shaheen

36:14.346 --> 36:15.825
for questioning.

36:15.869 --> 36:17.784
This isn't over.KILBRIDE: Actually, it is.

36:17.827 --> 36:20.047
I just got off the phone
with LAPD.

36:20.090 --> 36:24.007
They, uh, picked up
Officer Varza an hour ago.

36:24.051 --> 36:26.923
They found her in a state
of delirium

36:26.967 --> 36:28.534
about a mile from her house.

36:28.577 --> 36:31.711
And the State Department
has ordered us

36:31.754 --> 36:34.409
to release the Iranian
intelligence agents

36:34.453 --> 36:38.631
and to drop any investigation
of Reza Shaheen.

36:38.674 --> 36:39.936
SAM:
You got to be kidding me.

36:39.980 --> 36:41.677
They kidnapped a Naval officer.

36:41.721 --> 36:43.940
Why are they doing this?KILBRIDE: The greater good,

36:43.984 --> 36:46.204
or so they claim.

36:46.247 --> 36:49.207
It seems that
the never-ending talks

36:49.250 --> 36:53.080
on the Iran nuclear deal
have hit a crucial stage.

36:53.123 --> 36:56.039
Neither side wants
to ruffle feathers.

36:56.083 --> 36:58.041
Does Varza know
what happened to her?

36:58.085 --> 36:59.304
Does she remember anything?

36:59.347 --> 37:01.219
She's still being treated
at the hospital,

37:01.262 --> 37:04.352
But as far as we are concerned,
this case is closed.

37:04.396 --> 37:08.400
For now. We will
keep very close tabs

37:08.443 --> 37:11.533
on Shaheen.
The minute the deal is done

37:11.577 --> 37:14.057
or falls through...

37:14.101 --> 37:16.451
he's ours.

37:18.018 --> 37:19.019
FATIMA:
I'm so sorry

37:19.062 --> 37:21.543
about everything.

37:21.587 --> 37:23.458
Me too.

37:23.502 --> 37:25.678
I was naive believing
the world would see my work

37:25.721 --> 37:27.593
the way I intended it.

37:27.636 --> 37:31.379
But until we learn to start
trusting one another,

37:31.423 --> 37:33.816
every good thing will
look like a threat

37:33.860 --> 37:36.819
instead of an opportunity
to make a better world.

37:39.257 --> 37:40.432
[door opens]OFFICER: Right this way.

37:44.044 --> 37:46.612
How's Varza?Physically okay.

37:46.655 --> 37:50.093
She has no memory
of the last 24 hours.

37:50.137 --> 37:52.400
Found traces of benzodiazepine
in her system.

37:52.444 --> 37:55.055
It's used to extract information
during interrogations.

37:55.098 --> 37:57.318
Who knows what all
she told them.

37:57.362 --> 38:00.016
Did you have them
take a look at that?No. I'll be fine.

38:00.060 --> 38:01.453
As long as I get
something to eat soon.

38:01.496 --> 38:05.108
Well, it's almost sundown.

38:05.152 --> 38:07.285
Do you want to
break fast together?

38:09.112 --> 38:10.375
Yeah. I-I'd love that.

38:11.941 --> 38:13.595
I know it's traditional
to start with

38:13.639 --> 38:15.510
three dates,
uh, to break a fast.

38:15.554 --> 38:17.120
Well, why don't we just
start with one date

38:17.164 --> 38:18.470
and see how it goes?

38:18.513 --> 38:20.689
No, I meant dates,
the pitted fruit.

38:20.733 --> 38:22.256
I brought some if you...Akhil.

38:22.300 --> 38:23.344
It was a joke.

38:23.388 --> 38:26.304
Oh. Right.

38:27.566 --> 38:29.524
Come on, I know a place.

38:31.700 --> 38:33.441
Were those in your pocket
all day?

38:33.485 --> 38:35.835
Yeah. Got a little smushed
when I was tackled.

38:35.878 --> 38:37.097
[laughs]

38:37.140 --> 38:38.490
Hey.KENSI: Hey.

38:38.533 --> 38:41.406
So, I got something else
from the case officer.

38:41.449 --> 38:43.625
This is the number

38:43.669 --> 38:46.062
for Rosa's aunt's house.[gasps]

38:46.106 --> 38:47.934
I thought you might want
to check in on her.

38:47.977 --> 38:50.284
Oh, my gosh, of course I do.
Thank you so much.

38:50.328 --> 38:52.330
Of course.Okay.

38:53.548 --> 38:56.769
[line ringing][exhales]

38:56.812 --> 38:58.640
[speaking Spanish]

39:09.390 --> 39:11.087
Gracias.

39:11.131 --> 39:13.481
De nada.

39:16.354 --> 39:18.921
Rosa?

39:18.965 --> 39:21.097
Hi. How are you?

39:21.141 --> 39:24.797
It's so good to hear your voice.

39:24.840 --> 39:27.539
Yeah. I, uh, how's everything?
Are you in school?

39:31.760 --> 39:33.414
I know, I... Yes.

39:33.458 --> 39:35.503
I remember those days.
[chuckles]

39:37.026 --> 39:38.506
When?

39:40.290 --> 39:42.945
That's amazing.
That's amazing.

39:42.989 --> 39:44.077
[knocking]

39:44.120 --> 39:46.775
[man speaking Russian]

39:46.819 --> 39:48.821
Hey. Thanks for coming.

39:48.864 --> 39:51.519
That's him?Yep. That is
Arnold Baines.

39:51.563 --> 39:54.522
I pulled up the permits and
the certificates of ownership

39:54.566 --> 39:56.045
for the house
in Cypress Park.

39:56.089 --> 39:59.397
Arnold Baines bought
the parcel in 1986.

39:59.440 --> 40:02.443
The previous owner was
a behavioral psychiatrist

40:02.487 --> 40:05.054
by the name of Howard Pembrook.

40:05.098 --> 40:07.448
Pembrook, Pembroke.

40:08.710 --> 40:10.756
What happened to him?He died the same year.

40:10.799 --> 40:12.322
Except he didn't, Nate.
He just changed his name.

40:12.366 --> 40:14.586
Arnold Baines is Pembrook.

40:14.629 --> 40:16.631
Arnold Baines
is the guy in the film.

40:18.981 --> 40:21.506
C-Come on, he...
he's got the same voice.

40:21.549 --> 40:22.507
I-I'm not so sure.

40:24.291 --> 40:26.380
You saw how he acted.

40:26.424 --> 40:27.729
He understood me
when I spoke Russian.

40:27.773 --> 40:29.296
Callen...Nate,

40:29.339 --> 40:31.472
I'm not making this up.I know, I know.

40:31.516 --> 40:33.039
Why don't we just
pick this up tomorrow?

40:33.082 --> 40:35.607
L-Look at it
with fresh eyes.

40:38.305 --> 40:40.220
Sure. Yeah, that's fine.

40:40.263 --> 40:41.656
I'm-I'm not doing much else.

40:41.700 --> 40:42.788
We'll get her, Callen.

40:43.789 --> 40:45.268
We will.

41:19.564 --> 41:21.609
Hey. How are you?

41:21.653 --> 41:24.003
I'm sorry about this morning.

41:24.046 --> 41:25.700
I'm sorry, too.

41:25.744 --> 41:29.530
Listen, Callen, I don't
want to take a step back.

41:29.574 --> 41:31.619
And I really don't
want to move in with Arkady.

41:31.663 --> 41:33.099
I don't know what
I was thinking.

41:33.142 --> 41:34.230
No, you were right.

41:34.274 --> 41:35.710
I-I have been obsessed,

41:35.754 --> 41:38.626
and I can promise you
it is over now.

41:40.323 --> 41:41.847
I'm headed to the new place now.

41:44.066 --> 41:46.112
You there?

41:46.155 --> 41:47.505
I'm just finishing up work.

41:47.548 --> 41:50.116
I will see you soon, all right?

41:50.159 --> 41:52.248
Bye.
