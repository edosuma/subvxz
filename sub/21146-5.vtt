WEBVTT

00:13.098 --> 00:15.642
I was never in love with him.

00:18.603 --> 00:21.815
I came here to get divorced.

00:21.898 --> 00:24.943
That's what we were talking about.
Getting divorced.

00:25.276 --> 00:30.740
That's right.
She's my wife, asshole.

00:31.700 --> 00:32.701
Hey!

00:33.118 --> 00:34.577
Jesse! Hey! Hey!

00:35.036 --> 00:38.581
Jesse, don't! It's not his fault, okay?

00:38.665 --> 00:41.209
You want to take it out on someone,
take it out on me.

00:41.292 --> 00:43.712
You picked the wrong guy, asshole.

00:43.795 --> 00:44.921
Pat! Guys!

00:45.004 --> 00:46.214
And we were done, remember?

00:46.631 --> 00:47.882
After Dallas?

00:47.966 --> 00:49.384
You left me.

00:51.761 --> 00:52.971
Guys!

00:53.388 --> 00:54.389
What the...

00:56.474 --> 00:57.642
Damn it, Jesse.

00:59.728 --> 01:00.729
What did you do?

01:02.147 --> 01:03.565
Wait, where are you going?

01:05.316 --> 01:07.277
Jesse. Jesse.

01:08.319 --> 01:10.447
Jesse Custer, you cannot do that to him.

01:15.535 --> 01:16.828
Jesse...

01:17.579 --> 01:18.580
Viktor!

01:23.001 --> 01:24.753
All right, I get it. You're mad.

01:26.212 --> 01:27.964
I should've told you I was married.

01:29.048 --> 01:30.216
I should've said something.

01:30.300 --> 01:33.636
But it wouldn't have been an issue
if we hadn't come to New Orleans.

01:34.512 --> 01:35.513
Jesse?

01:40.518 --> 01:42.270
Jesse, I'm sorry, okay?

01:43.188 --> 01:44.189
I'm sorry.

01:45.398 --> 01:47.484
Hurting him is not gonna fix anything.

01:47.692 --> 01:48.860
So stop.

01:50.862 --> 01:53.823
Are you listening to me?
You can't do this.

01:54.199 --> 01:56.451
It was me, Jesse. It was my fault.

01:56.534 --> 01:58.703
He didn't do anything wrong.

01:58.787 --> 01:59.788
I mean it.

02:01.206 --> 02:02.248
You can't do this.

02:03.833 --> 02:05.168
Stop, you crazy-ass son of a...

02:05.251 --> 02:06.461
Get out.

02:11.841 --> 02:13.301
Remember Dallas, Jesse.

02:14.719 --> 02:16.262
I don't wanna do that again.

03:03.184 --> 03:04.769
No!

03:09.732 --> 03:11.776
Come on. What is it?

03:13.778 --> 03:16.906
The baby. The baby.

03:26.958 --> 03:28.710
You like John Wayne?

03:30.503 --> 03:31.588
You don't?

03:31.671 --> 03:34.674
I think he's kind of patriarchal.

03:35.592 --> 03:36.718
What does that mean?

03:36.801 --> 03:40.722
We did a section on him
in my Oppositional Gender Studies class.

03:47.854 --> 03:51.983
And, like, the only women
you see in all of his movies

03:53.318 --> 03:56.738
need to be saved because
they're about to get raped

03:56.821 --> 04:01.951
by, like, indigenous peoples
or they're, like, cooking biscuits.

04:09.709 --> 04:12.337
You know, I think John Wayne's
real respectful to women.

04:13.004 --> 04:16.758
Yeah, in, like, a patriarchal kind of way.

04:17.508 --> 04:19.344
Tulip!

04:20.470 --> 04:21.471
Reggie.

04:22.221 --> 04:24.223
- Hey, you.
- Hey.

04:26.476 --> 04:28.519
Oh, look. Cowboys.

04:28.895 --> 04:29.896
Mmm-hmm.

04:30.521 --> 04:31.940
Come on, guys.

04:32.023 --> 04:35.944
If y'all are gonna smoke in here,
at least open a window.

04:36.277 --> 04:37.737
Sorry, Tules. My bad.

04:40.365 --> 04:44.369
And, Reggie, we have
a dinner guest coming, so...

04:44.452 --> 04:45.620
- What're we having?
- Who?

04:45.703 --> 04:46.829
Dany. I told you.

04:47.497 --> 04:53.127
No. We, the invited guests,
are having peanut butter pot roast.

04:53.211 --> 04:55.964
In, like, half an hour, so yeah.

04:56.297 --> 04:57.799
Awesome.

04:57.882 --> 05:00.927
But I have, like,
a bit of a nut allergy, so is it, like...

05:01.010 --> 05:02.387
You're not invited, Reggie.

05:04.055 --> 05:05.431
Oh, man.

05:05.890 --> 05:07.308
Yeah, right. Yeah.

05:07.475 --> 05:08.935
Like, my night is stacked.

05:09.018 --> 05:11.854
I've got Netflix out the ying-yang, so...

05:13.606 --> 05:16.150
Later, bro. See you, T.

05:19.779 --> 05:22.323
You maybe wanna take a shower?

05:22.949 --> 05:25.576
All of, like, North America
would appreciate it.

05:26.285 --> 05:28.079
Why is Dany coming to dinner?

05:29.038 --> 05:32.834
Because she's our friend and we miss her.

05:34.794 --> 05:35.795
We do?

05:46.014 --> 05:47.348
A realtor?

05:48.725 --> 05:50.935
Well, not yet.

05:52.145 --> 05:56.899
I print stuff out, get supplies and,
you know, put out the "For Sale" signs...

05:56.983 --> 06:00.236
So, a realtor's assistant?

06:01.112 --> 06:03.322
Um, I don't really
have a title yet.

06:04.365 --> 06:06.451
Take in the "For Sale" signs...

06:07.368 --> 06:08.911
Hmm.

06:08.995 --> 06:12.248
Rewarding. Like working
the Mars program at NASA.

06:12.457 --> 06:13.458
Mmm.

06:14.417 --> 06:17.503
And Jesse's got a bartending job.

06:17.587 --> 06:18.796
And they love him.

06:19.672 --> 06:21.507
He's already got, like, two night shifts.

06:22.592 --> 06:23.593
So we're good.

06:24.761 --> 06:25.762
Right?

06:27.013 --> 06:28.347
Mmm-hmm.

06:31.601 --> 06:32.602
How are you, Dany?

06:33.186 --> 06:34.187
My dog died.

06:37.648 --> 06:40.234
So when are you two
coming back to work for me?

06:40.318 --> 06:41.319
We're not.

06:42.111 --> 06:44.072
I didn't know you had a dog.

06:44.822 --> 06:46.699
I don't. It died.

06:47.575 --> 06:52.121
As of now, here's what I've got going
that's worth doing.

06:53.498 --> 06:55.666
An insurance scam in Santa Fe.

06:55.917 --> 06:58.795
Grab and burn,
but the gallery's in on it, so, easy.

06:59.337 --> 07:04.050
Connected guy in New Orleans looking for
some general sub-contract stuff. And then,

07:04.509 --> 07:06.844
if you're asking, my first choice,

07:07.553 --> 07:09.472
there's this little Jew bastard
down in Houston...

07:09.555 --> 07:11.224
- No.
- Hold on. Let me finish.

07:11.307 --> 07:13.101
No way. Absolutely not.

07:13.184 --> 07:15.269
You know what he said to me the other day?

07:15.353 --> 07:16.771
Do you know what he said?

07:16.854 --> 07:19.774
We are not killing your husband, Dany.
You know we don't do that.

07:20.441 --> 07:21.567
Not doing any of that anymore.

07:23.152 --> 07:24.153
Right.

07:26.197 --> 07:29.867
If that's why you've come back here,
you've wasted your time.

07:39.836 --> 07:40.837
How's your food?

07:41.337 --> 07:43.214
Well, this, I can't eat.

07:43.297 --> 07:44.465
Or this or this.

07:44.549 --> 07:46.884
Oh, my gosh, I am so sorry. Is...

07:47.093 --> 07:48.427
Is that a Jewish thing?

07:48.845 --> 07:51.055
It's a human being thing. It's disgusting.

07:51.681 --> 07:53.266
Look, I get it.

07:53.349 --> 07:56.352
Things went sideways on your last job
and it threw you.

07:56.435 --> 07:58.020
But this is not the answer.

07:58.271 --> 08:00.523
This is what you do.

08:01.274 --> 08:03.025
Better than almost anyone else I know.

08:03.109 --> 08:04.110
Not anymore.

08:05.903 --> 08:06.904
People change.

08:08.573 --> 08:10.741
What? No, they don't.

08:17.206 --> 08:18.708
Okay, then.

08:20.251 --> 08:22.503
Forgive me if I don't stay for dessert.

08:23.462 --> 08:25.381
I'm angry enough as it is.

08:25.464 --> 08:27.175
Dany? Um...

08:27.258 --> 08:28.551
Any news on Carlos?

08:29.552 --> 08:32.013
If I hear anything, I'll let you know.

08:32.388 --> 08:34.515
Meantime, you say
you're moving on,

08:34.599 --> 08:36.309
so move on.

08:38.269 --> 08:39.937
You've got houses to sell.

09:12.136 --> 09:14.555
- Ready?
- Mmm-hmm.

09:28.736 --> 09:29.737
Okay.

10:26.752 --> 10:28.004
What are you doing with that stool?

10:30.298 --> 10:31.299
Holding it.

10:33.134 --> 10:34.552
What are you doing with that beer?

10:35.594 --> 10:36.595
Drinking it.

10:39.432 --> 10:40.474
Huh.

10:51.152 --> 10:53.070
Till the end of the world, right?

10:55.448 --> 10:56.907
Till the end of the world.

11:06.834 --> 11:08.669
Hey. Asshole.

11:09.045 --> 11:10.671
Hey, hey, hey. Talking to you.

11:15.801 --> 11:17.720
Let's go. I don't have all day.

11:21.265 --> 11:22.558
No, you don't.

11:39.784 --> 11:42.828
Yay! Look, it's my friend, Cassidy.

11:43.829 --> 11:46.499
- Who's this?
- This is my stepdaughter, Allie.

11:46.999 --> 11:50.378
She's had a rough day, so I thought
it would be fun if she'd come hang with us.

11:51.128 --> 11:54.382
Oh, yeah, right. Well, we...
We do fun like nobody's business.

11:54.465 --> 11:55.800
Yeah, we sure do.

11:56.092 --> 11:58.052
Now, you just sit right there,

11:58.135 --> 12:01.305
and I was thinking,
I don't know, comfort food?

12:01.806 --> 12:03.474
And I got just the thing.

12:05.142 --> 12:06.477
You having a bit of a rough day?

12:06.560 --> 12:08.979
Pretty much. Her boyfriend's killing my dad.

12:09.063 --> 12:11.315
No. They're just talking.

12:11.399 --> 12:13.609
- Right, Cassidy?
- Oh, yeah, that's right.

12:14.360 --> 12:15.444
If it's the Jesse Custer I know,

12:15.528 --> 12:17.988
he's gonna be talking his bloody ears off.

12:18.739 --> 12:19.740
So to speak.

12:19.824 --> 12:23.953
Now who here thinks
Boo Berry is just the best?

12:24.036 --> 12:26.122
- Me.
- That's just chemicals.

12:27.498 --> 12:28.582
No, it's not.

12:29.834 --> 12:31.252
Boo Berry's awesome.

12:32.002 --> 12:33.879
Okay, well, it's all right.

12:34.004 --> 12:36.340
No, come on. We're gonna have to see
what else we have.

12:36.424 --> 12:40.010
We have, my God, a lot of potted meat.

12:40.261 --> 12:43.139
We have a box of plastic forks,
we've got some kosher green lentils...

12:43.222 --> 12:44.348
Is that man dead?

12:45.182 --> 12:47.476
What? Oh, shite.

12:49.145 --> 12:50.479
No, that's just Denis.

12:50.563 --> 12:53.774
Maybe Allie could go watch TV with Denis
while you and me talk, huh?

12:53.858 --> 12:56.444
That's a great idea. Denis'd love that.

12:56.527 --> 12:58.279
- But I don't want to...
- Yeah, I'm sure you don't.

12:58.362 --> 13:00.448
Just take the lentils. Brilliant.

13:00.531 --> 13:02.700
There you go. On your way.

13:05.911 --> 13:06.996
Now, what happened?

13:08.706 --> 13:10.374
Bollocks! Ouch.

13:10.583 --> 13:11.709
You told him!

13:12.835 --> 13:14.295
But what was I supposed to do?

13:14.378 --> 13:16.130
You were supposed to not tell him!

13:16.213 --> 13:17.756
Now, just hang on a second.

13:18.257 --> 13:19.258
Ow!

13:19.383 --> 13:22.636
You told me you pissed off
your mobster husband,

13:22.720 --> 13:24.805
you just disappeared off
into the middle of the night,

13:24.889 --> 13:27.141
and you stopped answering my texts.
I was worried about you!

13:27.516 --> 13:28.726
"Worried", right. Sure.

13:28.934 --> 13:29.935
What?

13:30.728 --> 13:32.271
"Tulip, I feel bad.

13:32.354 --> 13:35.524
"Oh, Tulip, I don't like
keeping secrets from my mate."

13:35.608 --> 13:37.985
- No, wait a minute. That's true.
- Like it's moral.

13:38.360 --> 13:39.445
Like you're a good guy.

13:40.905 --> 13:42.239
What are you talking about?

13:42.323 --> 13:45.242
I'm not blind, Cassidy. I know what you want.

13:46.869 --> 13:50.247
What in the shite
is that supposed to mean?

13:51.832 --> 13:53.751
- No, come on, what?
- Forget it.

13:56.629 --> 13:58.088
You're me friend, Tulip.

13:59.256 --> 14:00.424
You know, you both are.

14:00.508 --> 14:01.592
I know.

14:02.551 --> 14:05.596
I definitely bollocks
this one up though, haven't I?

14:07.223 --> 14:08.432
Were you even in danger?

14:08.891 --> 14:10.351
With Viktor? No.

14:11.018 --> 14:12.436
I mean, he was pissed,

14:13.229 --> 14:16.857
but there was, like, less than a 3% chance
he would've hurt me or anything.

14:16.941 --> 14:18.609
It's no wonder you married him.

14:23.072 --> 14:24.114
Why did you marry him?

14:25.950 --> 14:28.077
He's got two pools.
Who wouldn't marry him?

14:29.245 --> 14:31.247
No, but why did you marry him?

14:31.664 --> 14:37.127
Cassidy, right now my boyfriend has
my husband on a hook in a torture room.

14:37.753 --> 14:40.214
"Why'd you marry him?"
is not the question here.

14:40.589 --> 14:43.968
And I swear to God,
if Jesse kills him, we are done.

14:52.643 --> 14:53.644
All right.

14:57.314 --> 14:58.566
What are you doing?

14:58.983 --> 15:01.360
Going to have a talk
with this mad bastard.

15:01.443 --> 15:02.778
Clean up my mess.

15:02.861 --> 15:03.862
What are you gonna say?

15:04.363 --> 15:05.364
Trust me.

15:06.907 --> 15:07.908
Yeah.

15:09.868 --> 15:10.869
All right.

15:28.262 --> 15:29.430
Hey, asshole.

15:30.764 --> 15:32.391
I've been thinking.

15:32.600 --> 15:35.269
During my free time here,
I figured something out.

15:36.228 --> 15:39.023
When Tulip came to work for me
a couple years back,

15:39.523 --> 15:41.900
I could see
she'd just been through something.

15:42.526 --> 15:45.529
I could see it in her eyes, you know.

15:46.113 --> 15:48.073
But she never talked about it.

15:48.574 --> 15:50.993
Never said a word about it
one way or the other.

15:51.368 --> 15:52.745
She was always tough.

15:53.370 --> 15:56.707
She was tougher than any of my guys,
I'll tell you. That's for sure.

15:57.374 --> 15:59.501
But I always wondered what it was.

16:00.669 --> 16:05.090
A strong woman like this?
A hard woman like this?

16:06.383 --> 16:08.677
What sort of fresh hell did she crawl out of?

16:10.971 --> 16:12.848
I get it now, asshole.

16:14.975 --> 16:16.060
It was you.

16:23.275 --> 16:27.071
<i>When I close my eyes and dream</i>

16:27.154 --> 16:30.616
<i>I'll kiss you once again</i>

16:30.699 --> 16:33.243
<i>I'll pretend</i>

16:34.244 --> 16:37.623
<i>Yes, I'll pretend</i>

16:39.667 --> 16:43.962
<i>I'll pretend that we are walking</i>

16:44.046 --> 16:46.924
<i>Down the aisle</i>

16:47.883 --> 16:51.679
<i>I wish I knew what I did, dear</i>

16:51.762 --> 16:54.682
<i>To make you treat me so</i>

16:54.765 --> 16:55.766
Okay.

16:58.936 --> 17:02.356
<i>Did you ever love me?</i>

17:02.439 --> 17:04.358
<i>Love me</i>

17:05.818 --> 17:10.072
<i>My eyes are empty, I stare blindly</i>

17:10.155 --> 17:14.076
<i>Fixed on you
You're stumbling mutely</i>

17:25.295 --> 17:30.134
<i>My fixtures turn without intent to my fist</i>

17:30.217 --> 17:33.512
<i>Connect them then I strike you</i>

17:33.595 --> 17:37.349
<i>Men are empty, I stare blindly</i>

17:37.433 --> 17:41.353
<i>Fixed on you
You're stumbling mutely</i>

18:00.956 --> 18:01.957
'Kay.

18:04.835 --> 18:05.836
Wait.

18:10.799 --> 18:11.800
God,

18:13.510 --> 18:16.346
we're in no position to ask any favors,

18:17.431 --> 18:20.893
but still, we're asking.

18:23.645 --> 18:25.105
Please.

18:26.356 --> 18:30.527
In Jesus' name we pray.

18:33.030 --> 18:34.198
Amen.

18:38.452 --> 18:39.453
Amen.

19:17.699 --> 19:19.243
<i>Forgiveness.</i>

19:19.743 --> 19:21.453
<i>Forgiveness is a virtue.</i>

19:22.663 --> 19:25.833
<i>Now, we are all without truth sometimes.
We are all sinners.</i>

19:26.250 --> 19:28.001
<i>And we are all in need of God's forgiveness</i>

19:28.085 --> 19:32.089
<i>or we risk rejection
at Heaven's holiest of gates.</i>

19:32.881 --> 19:37.219
<i>But, luckily, He is a loving and merciful God.</i>

19:37.302 --> 19:40.097
<i>His forgiveness can't be earned.
And you'll ask,</i>

19:40.430 --> 19:43.392
<i>"But, Preacher,
how do I earn His forgiveness?</i>

19:43.475 --> 19:46.770
<i>"What can I do?"
Well, the answer's quite simple, actually.</i>

19:47.437 --> 19:51.275
<i>If you put your faith
in His son, Jesus Christ,</i>

19:51.358 --> 19:56.655
<i>as your Lord and Savior,
then forgiveness is within your reach.</i>

20:17.009 --> 20:18.260
Sorry, bro.

20:31.607 --> 20:34.401
Tulip!

20:35.903 --> 20:37.487
Hey, hon.

20:38.614 --> 20:41.199
- How was work?
- Oh, you know.

20:41.783 --> 20:43.160
Same old, same old.

20:43.785 --> 20:45.787
- Grab me another beer?
- Sure.

20:45.871 --> 20:47.623
- You want a beer?
- I'm good.

20:55.923 --> 20:56.924
Thanks.

21:04.056 --> 21:05.432
Sell any houses today?

21:05.515 --> 21:06.767
Uh...

21:06.850 --> 21:09.353
Couple. I mean, I didn't,

21:09.895 --> 21:12.773
but I helped the boss-man, you know.

21:13.190 --> 21:14.483
Well, you keep at it.

21:15.025 --> 21:17.653
You'll be selling those houses yourself
in no time.

21:22.866 --> 21:23.867
Yeah.

21:25.202 --> 21:26.662
I found your shit.

21:30.207 --> 21:32.709
Ooh! Damn, T.
What have you been doin'?

21:32.793 --> 21:33.877
Shut up, Reggie.

21:34.294 --> 21:36.546
How long you been
back working with Dany?

21:37.881 --> 21:39.216
Let me ask that another way.

21:40.509 --> 21:41.635
The real estate job?

21:43.178 --> 21:44.513
How long you last?

21:46.807 --> 21:47.808
Three weeks.

21:48.475 --> 21:49.559
Three weeks?

21:49.643 --> 21:51.645
No, that's nothing.
I once had a gig, it was...

21:51.728 --> 21:53.063
Shut up, Reggie.

21:54.940 --> 21:57.567
Me, as a real estate broker?

21:57.943 --> 22:03.198
Making coffee and copies and escrow
for 15 bucks an hour?

22:03.281 --> 22:04.700
Could have found something else to do.

22:04.783 --> 22:06.201
I did, and I'm doing it.

22:08.620 --> 22:10.080
The only thing we're good at.

22:10.497 --> 22:13.083
You know, this feels like
one of those boyfriend/girlfriend...

22:13.166 --> 22:14.876
- Then go, Reggie.
- Stay.

22:16.420 --> 22:17.796
We were having fun, Jesse.

22:18.171 --> 22:19.256
Remember?

22:19.339 --> 22:21.466
- Till Carlos, we had fun.
- Right.

22:22.592 --> 22:25.262
Before that little thing,
we were having a hell of a time.

22:28.432 --> 22:30.517
That hurt me as much as you.

22:30.600 --> 22:32.144
Oh, it hurt you, Tulip?

22:32.894 --> 22:34.438
Were you hurt by it?

22:36.148 --> 22:38.150
You know I was, you son of a bitch.

22:38.775 --> 22:40.068
What are these then?

22:42.487 --> 22:43.947
Tucked up there, extra hidden.

22:46.324 --> 22:47.826
Bro, this is really uncomfortable.

22:47.909 --> 22:50.078
It's all right. We're just talking.

22:51.580 --> 22:53.165
When were you gonna stop lying to me?

22:53.248 --> 22:54.624
I'm sorry.

22:55.959 --> 22:57.961
You see, I thought we were in this together.

23:00.255 --> 23:01.256
I wanted to be.

23:02.257 --> 23:03.842
I tried to be.

23:03.925 --> 23:05.635
But this life you want,

23:07.471 --> 23:09.473
- doesn't it feel wrong to you?
- No.

23:09.806 --> 23:11.641
And I don't know why it feels wrong to you.

23:12.100 --> 23:16.897
Because I'm an O'Hare, Jesse.
I don't know how to do it.

23:19.649 --> 23:20.776
Maybe you're right.

23:23.195 --> 23:25.072
Or maybe you don't deserve it.

23:34.206 --> 23:35.207
Bro.

23:37.959 --> 23:39.294
But a Custer does, right?

23:41.713 --> 23:42.964
Is that what you're trying to do here?

23:44.633 --> 23:45.926
Be a Custer again?

23:47.511 --> 23:52.307
Like having a crap job and a crap life
gives you the forgiveness you need

23:53.183 --> 23:54.434
for what you done?

23:54.851 --> 23:57.229
Make you one of the good guys, huh?

23:58.188 --> 24:01.566
Like your stuck-up daddy
and your stupid John Wayne?

24:03.151 --> 24:05.695
Well, I got some bad news for you,
Jesse Custer.

24:07.864 --> 24:10.492
You ain't ever gonna be forgiven.

24:16.373 --> 24:18.333
Guys? Can I just...

24:20.168 --> 24:21.920
Jesse. Jesse!

24:23.213 --> 24:24.214
Jesse, stop.

24:24.965 --> 24:26.091
Jesse, stop!

24:29.761 --> 24:30.762
God!

24:42.983 --> 24:45.068
<i>So we can just take pure, titanium white.</i>

24:45.152 --> 24:46.528
<i>And I'm just gonna use the knife.</i>

24:46.611 --> 24:48.822
<i>You can take your finger
or you can take a brush,</i>

24:48.905 --> 24:52.826
<i>but I wanna push forcibly
some white paint right into there.</i>

24:53.743 --> 24:55.412
<i>'Cause we don't make mistakes.</i>

24:56.079 --> 24:58.331
- Going out?
- Mmm-hmm.

24:58.832 --> 25:01.585
<i>Now, we're gonna
take our blender brush</i>

25:02.085 --> 25:03.420
<i>and very gently...</i>

25:04.462 --> 25:06.464
My dad's church is still in my name.

25:06.548 --> 25:07.966
What?

25:10.427 --> 25:12.262
It's just sitting there empty.

25:14.472 --> 25:16.433
I called the lawyer to double-check.

25:18.768 --> 25:20.312
Anyway, it's mine.

25:22.272 --> 25:23.565
Yeah?

25:27.527 --> 25:29.154
I'm going back to Annville.

25:31.531 --> 25:32.991
I'm gonna be a preacher.

25:37.746 --> 25:39.247
Good luck with that.

26:40.892 --> 26:42.394
How're we doing in here then?

26:43.395 --> 26:44.896
Do you mind if I join?

26:47.190 --> 26:50.694
I'm just gonna walk into this very nice...

26:50.860 --> 26:53.697
God! Bloody hell!
It's an unbelievable bedroom, isn't it?

26:57.492 --> 27:01.871
I think I'll just sit on the bed next to my mate.

27:05.500 --> 27:06.584
Long day, eh?

27:10.005 --> 27:13.091
I just poked me head
through the little torture room downstairs.

27:14.551 --> 27:16.928
Met our man hanging from the ceiling.

27:17.012 --> 27:19.723
He's still alive, which is nice. It's fair.

27:20.432 --> 27:22.517
It's very restrained. Christ almighty!

27:23.476 --> 27:25.353
Sheets are silky bastards, eh?

27:25.729 --> 27:28.732
I think a couple hundred foreskins
have gone into making those, easily.

27:31.568 --> 27:33.236
Do you know, I was rich once.

27:35.405 --> 27:36.740
Bloody years ago.

27:40.243 --> 27:42.370
I really quite enjoyed it, actually.

27:47.876 --> 27:50.253
You know what happened here, right?

27:51.004 --> 27:53.590
You two had a falling out, and she was down.

27:53.673 --> 27:57.719
She fell in with the first
two-pool-owning bloke she met.

27:57.802 --> 27:59.137
And that was it.

28:00.055 --> 28:02.182
But she doesn't love him
and she never did

28:02.265 --> 28:04.934
because she loves you, you stupid idiot.

28:06.102 --> 28:07.645
If there's one thing I know,

28:09.814 --> 28:11.274
trust me, it's that.

28:13.109 --> 28:15.695
Can I ask you a question, Cassidy?

28:16.279 --> 28:18.073
Of course you can. It's why I've come.

28:18.156 --> 28:20.116
To dispense my considerable wisdoms.

28:20.784 --> 28:22.786
After lying to me all this time?

28:23.620 --> 28:24.913
Probably since Texas.

28:26.164 --> 28:29.793
Probably since she came back
downstairs at the casino.

28:30.877 --> 28:32.754
After all that lying,

28:34.297 --> 28:36.633
why in the world would I ever trust you?

28:37.967 --> 28:40.220
I wanted to tell you, mate. Really I did.

28:40.303 --> 28:41.930
I hate keeping secrets
from my friend, all right?

28:42.013 --> 28:44.140
But you keep them all the same, don't you?

28:44.224 --> 28:46.601
- I don't. I don't.
- Lie to my face?

28:49.187 --> 28:50.855
Sneak behind my back?

28:51.856 --> 28:53.733
Now you're here to be a hero?

28:55.902 --> 28:58.822
To be a friend and
talk me out of doing this?

28:59.572 --> 29:02.492
Not to make excuses here, mate,
but you know what?

29:03.993 --> 29:08.456
This whole thing, it's put me between
a rock and a hard place, all right?

29:08.540 --> 29:10.166
You didn't answer my question.

29:10.917 --> 29:13.670
Well, then,
maybe you should remind me, huh?

29:14.295 --> 29:16.923
I asked you, why should I trust you?

29:19.592 --> 29:25.598
Why should I trust a lying, junkie vampire
who thinks everything's a joke?

29:26.683 --> 29:29.894
Why in the world would anyone trust you?

29:34.858 --> 29:36.025
You're right.

29:36.985 --> 29:39.237
I am. I'm a right bastard.

29:40.113 --> 29:41.906
I try to tell people all the time,

29:41.990 --> 29:44.784
but sometimes I just don't think
they believe me.

29:46.369 --> 29:50.999
But you're right.
I'm a greedy, selfish, destructive...

29:51.082 --> 29:52.876
You name it. Jealous.

29:53.710 --> 29:54.711
Yeah.

29:55.170 --> 29:58.089
Maybe that's the difference, though,
between me and you.

29:59.716 --> 30:03.219
Because you see,
me, if I was in your situation,

30:03.303 --> 30:06.973
if some moppet had their hands on my girl...

30:09.184 --> 30:14.147
And I'm not ashamed to admit it,
I don't think I'd be very restrained at all.

30:15.440 --> 30:16.566
No.

30:18.026 --> 30:20.987
I think I'd want to hurt them really, really bad.

30:22.489 --> 30:23.490
Yeah.

30:25.366 --> 30:28.411
I did not come here
to talk you out of anything, all right?

30:29.579 --> 30:31.664
I'm only here to let you know

30:32.749 --> 30:35.418
that whatever you decide,
I'm with you, Padre.

30:43.051 --> 30:44.928
It'd be over between us, Cass.

30:47.263 --> 30:48.598
If I did it.

30:50.600 --> 30:52.352
No, I don't know about that.

30:52.435 --> 30:55.021
No. She'd leave me.

30:56.564 --> 30:58.483
No more Jesse Custer and Tulip?

30:59.275 --> 31:02.946
Please. Some things will never change.

31:15.583 --> 31:17.126
One last thing I figured out.

31:22.048 --> 31:23.299
You want to know why Tulip married me?

31:25.176 --> 31:26.469
I know why.

31:27.136 --> 31:28.429
Oh, tell me.

31:29.889 --> 31:31.349
Because this is what she wanted.

31:33.476 --> 31:35.144
To be a criminal.

31:36.980 --> 31:38.356
Have money.

31:41.776 --> 31:43.319
This lifestyle.

31:46.823 --> 31:48.199
That's not why.

31:54.372 --> 31:55.498
Why, then?

31:56.874 --> 32:00.670
Because you're an asshole, asshole.

32:03.339 --> 32:04.841
And I was nice to her.

32:08.177 --> 32:09.679
Just thought you should know.

32:13.516 --> 32:14.642
Come on, let's go.

32:14.726 --> 32:17.186
Too late to change your mind. Let's do this.

32:17.270 --> 32:18.605
Come on, let's go.

32:19.814 --> 32:20.857
Come on.

32:27.363 --> 32:28.364
He's alive?

32:30.033 --> 32:31.534
He was when I left.

32:34.454 --> 32:35.788
Tell me again what you said to him?

32:35.872 --> 32:40.877
I just... I told him mistakes were made,
everyone feels bad, you know.

32:42.462 --> 32:44.130
Just to do the right thing.

32:44.213 --> 32:46.341
- And he listened?
- Yeah.

32:46.966 --> 32:49.218
Good. That's good.

32:49.636 --> 32:52.388
You know, I have a feeling that...

33:16.120 --> 33:17.205
What happened, Jesse?

33:19.707 --> 33:20.833
What did you do to him?

33:23.878 --> 33:25.171
I took him down.

33:29.759 --> 33:30.885
You took him down?

33:43.940 --> 33:45.108
Who's that?

33:47.944 --> 33:49.320
Viktor's daughter.

33:50.988 --> 33:52.115
Hmm.

33:54.242 --> 33:56.244
Allie, go watch more TV.

33:57.078 --> 33:58.121
- He...
- Go!

34:02.417 --> 34:03.668
You son of a bitch.

34:05.753 --> 34:06.879
What?

34:08.965 --> 34:12.593
What's going on? Why is everyone so...

34:14.804 --> 34:15.930
I took him down.

34:19.183 --> 34:21.060
Took him down how, Jesse?

34:21.561 --> 34:24.647
I cut his harness from the ceiling.

34:24.731 --> 34:25.732
I didn't kill him.

34:27.233 --> 34:30.153
- You didn't?
- Well, that's what I've been saying.

34:31.946 --> 34:33.489
I mean, I wanted to.

34:34.782 --> 34:37.118
Settled for divorce papers instead.

34:47.170 --> 34:48.337
Thank God.

34:50.506 --> 34:52.717
I'll go and let her know her dad's still alive.

34:54.010 --> 34:55.344
She'll be thrilled.

34:56.721 --> 34:57.847
I'm sorry.

34:59.182 --> 35:00.433
Me, too.

35:00.516 --> 35:02.059
I'm so bad for you.

35:04.228 --> 35:05.855
We're bad for each other.

35:09.525 --> 35:11.861
Yes! A thousand dollars.

35:11.944 --> 35:13.196
A thousand dollars.

35:13.279 --> 35:14.530
Cheap fool.

35:14.614 --> 35:16.032
Pay up, sucker.

35:16.157 --> 35:19.660
A chance right there on Oriental Avenue.

35:19.744 --> 35:22.330
- Pat wants a word if you're free.
- Right.

35:22.789 --> 35:24.957
What you're saying makes no sense.
You realize that, right?

35:25.041 --> 35:26.167
It makes total sense.

35:26.417 --> 35:29.796
Pay me my rent
or give me Atlantic Avenue.

35:29.879 --> 35:31.631
I gave you Ventnor
and I gave you Marvin Gardens.

35:31.714 --> 35:33.382
- That's more than fair.
- What are you, a baby?

35:33.716 --> 35:36.469
"More than fair."
This is America. Nut up or get out.

35:36.552 --> 35:38.429
All right, here.
There's Atlantic Avenue. Happy?

35:38.554 --> 35:39.555
Good boy.

35:41.057 --> 35:43.643
All right, bitches, here come the houses.

35:46.187 --> 35:47.855
I married a hard woman.

35:48.397 --> 35:49.565
Mmm-hmm.

35:53.569 --> 35:54.654
But I love her anyway.

36:02.870 --> 36:04.247
Thank you.

36:07.416 --> 36:08.417
That's my shirt.

36:09.460 --> 36:10.837
And I'm wearing it.

36:18.719 --> 36:20.304
Hard woman indeed.

36:25.101 --> 36:27.937
Well, try not to cheat.

36:50.626 --> 36:53.963
Hey, Dany. Long time.

36:54.463 --> 36:57.884
No, I'm not taking jobs anymore.

36:59.051 --> 37:00.720
Viktor gives me plenty of work.

37:03.389 --> 37:04.640
Yeah.

37:06.058 --> 37:07.476
Yes, I like it.

37:09.770 --> 37:12.440
Yeah, I'm happy. So I don't care what...

37:17.236 --> 37:19.989
You found him? You found Carlos?

37:21.282 --> 37:22.700
<i>No!</i>

37:23.367 --> 37:26.370
<i>The baby. The baby.</i>

37:26.871 --> 37:28.372
Does Jesse know?

37:29.165 --> 37:32.835
All right, lady. Let's do this.

37:34.211 --> 37:36.547
Do not pass Go.

37:36.672 --> 37:38.966
Do not collect 200.

37:45.723 --> 37:46.891
Tulip?

38:28.391 --> 38:30.226
I thought you were that crazy preacher.

38:30.768 --> 38:32.061
What's up, kiddo?

38:33.354 --> 38:34.855
Couldn't sleep.

38:35.231 --> 38:38.484
Well, how about a little target practice
in the basement, huh?

38:38.567 --> 38:40.695
You always like to do that,
makes you feel better.

38:42.738 --> 38:45.616
Could you just read to me, maybe?

38:47.118 --> 38:48.911
Of course, yeah. Come up here.

38:50.579 --> 38:51.914
All right.

38:54.041 --> 38:55.751
How's my little girl?

38:55.835 --> 38:57.003
Hmm?

38:58.421 --> 39:02.967
Well, "The Dow Jones Industrial
is up 46 points today.

39:04.051 --> 39:06.137
"Bringing it to an all-time high of..."

39:13.144 --> 39:14.395
Go to the closet.

39:41.797 --> 39:43.007
Preacher.

40:09.200 --> 40:12.661
The Preacher, I know where he is.
