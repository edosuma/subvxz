See? That's what you get.
Get out my face.

01:32:26.434 --> 01:32:30.188
Hey, cuteness. Uh-uh. Give me that. Give me.
Where did you get this from?

01:32:30.271 --> 01:32:32.232
Sit here quietly.

01:32:35.526 --> 01:32:37.362
I'm watchin' you, Rashanna.

01:32:38.363 --> 01:32:40.490
You have a good voice.
You should.

01:32:40.573 --> 01:32:42.116
Let me ask you something.

01:32:42.200 --> 01:32:45.620
Why did you name your kid
after a Jewish holiday?

01:32:49.415 --> 01:32:52.710
That's Rosh Hashanah, Jan.

01:32:52.794 --> 01:32:55.088
- [ Lytia ] Jan, really?
- Right.

01:32:55.171 --> 01:32:56.673
I knew that.

01:32:56.756 --> 01:32:59.050
Okay, I'm sorry that I had to bring them...

01:32:59.133 --> 01:33:00.885
- but I don't have a babysitter right now.
- It's okay.

01:33:00.969 --> 01:33:04.305
I brought mine with me. I think that's okay.

01:33:04.389 --> 01:33:06.724
What are we doin' about Single Moms Club?

01:33:06.808 --> 01:33:09.435
- When are we gettin' together again?
- I was thinking the same thing.

01:33:09.519 --> 01:33:11.980
But honestly,
it just wouldn't be the same without May.

01:33:12.063 --> 01:33:15.149
- I know. Has anyone heard from her?
- I tried to call her.

01:33:16.526 --> 01:33:18.486
TK! Come here, baby!

01:33:20.029 --> 01:33:23.032
Um, what's- what's up with May?

01:33:23.116 --> 01:33:26.160
- [Jan ] Yeah.
- She- She's okay. She's good.

01:33:26.244 --> 01:33:27.704
Is she gonna help us with this?

01:33:27.787 --> 01:33:29.706
I don't know.

01:33:29.789 --> 01:33:31.916
We really need her to come back.

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:33.793
Yeah, it's kind of unfair, you know?

01:33:33.876 --> 01:33:35.962
- She needs to be here helpin'-
- [ TK ] You got to understand.

01:33:36.045 --> 01:33:37.547
She's still in a funk about Rick.

01:33:37.630 --> 01:33:39.257
- That was pretty tough on her, right?
- [All ] Yeah.

01:33:39.340 --> 01:33:42.927
And, um, I have to call her
four or five times...

01:33:43.011 --> 01:33:45.096
before she even answers the phone, so-

01:33:45.179 --> 01:33:46.764
You've just got to give her a break here.

01:33:46.848 --> 01:33:48.891
She even told me she doesn't even feel
like writing anymore.

01:33:48.975 --> 01:33:51.394
- What?
- [Jan ] Oh, that's a shame. She's really good.

01:33:51.477 --> 01:33:52.645
Yeah.

01:33:52.729 --> 01:33:54.814
Well, you should tell her that.

01:33:54.897 --> 01:33:57.608
Well, she's not answering
the phone, so-

01:33:57.692 --> 01:34:00.486

What are you doing here?

01:35:15.978 --> 01:35:19.816
I have a boyfriend... and he loves me.

01:35:20.858 --> 01:35:23.611
He spends nights at my house.

01:35:23.694 --> 01:35:25.696
I don't know where
this relationship is going...

01:35:25.780 --> 01:35:29.826
but wherever it's going,
I'm in it and so is he.

01:35:29.909 --> 01:35:34.455
You will not talk about him
in front of Veronica.

01:35:34.539 --> 01:35:36.874
I don't talk about your wife
in front of Veronica.

01:35:36.958 --> 01:35:38.960
When I say that you have to call me...

01:35:39.043 --> 01:35:40.670
before you come over my house, I mean that.

01:35:40.753 --> 01:35:42.964
And when I say that my daughter
can't have something...

01:35:43.047 --> 01:35:44.590
you will honor what I'm telling her...

01:35:44.674 --> 01:35:46.509
and not undermine my parenting.

01:35:46.592 --> 01:35:49.554
- Do you understand?
- You through?

01:35:49.637 --> 01:35:50.763
I think so.

01:35:50.847 --> 01:35:53.516
All right. Why don't you listen to me?

01:35:53.599 --> 01:35:55.726
If you have a man,
then he can start supporting you.

01:35:55.810 --> 01:35:58.187
Actually, I'm not done yet.
I'm not done.

01:35:58.271 --> 01:36:01.899
If you threaten to take your support away...

01:36:01.983 --> 01:36:04.026
you will force me to take you to court.

01:36:04.110 --> 01:36:06.654
And from what I understand...

01:36:08.239 --> 01:36:10.366

Oh, my God.
Miss Fletcher is driving me crazy.

01:38:11.279 --> 01:38:13.030
I know.
She gave me extra homework...

01:38:13.114 --> 01:38:16.117
because I made out
with the piano teacher's son.

01:38:17.326 --> 01:38:18.995

Because I've made
a lot of mistakes with you, Kate.

01:38:37.763 --> 01:38:40.725
And I am so sorry.

01:38:40.808 --> 01:38:46.147
I made you feel like you were
the lowest thing on my list to do, and...

How did you know about him?
