Wow, Noelle!

Oh, Alex.

01:09.837 --> 01:10.636
Great, here.

01:10.671 --> 01:11.970
Hold these.

01:12.006 --> 01:14.139
More Christmas decorations?

01:14.175 --> 01:16.475
You can never have
too much Christmas.

01:16.510 --> 01:18.811
Says the woman named "Noelle."

01:18.846 --> 01:21.080
My mother loved
the holidays.

01:21.115 --> 01:22.481
You know, she wanted
to name me Jingle

01:22.516 --> 01:24.483
but my dad talked her out of it.

01:24.518 --> 01:27.319
Well, my mother only likes
the retail aspect of Christmas,

01:27.354 --> 01:30.155
so let's not over-do it, okay?

01:30.191 --> 01:32.124
<i>Oh, speaking of your mother.</i>

01:32.159 --> 01:33.325
Mrs. Fulton!

01:33.360 --> 01:34.593
Hello, Merry Christmas!

01:34.628 --> 01:35.861
Hello Noelle.

01:35.896 --> 01:41.166
Alex, is there a reason your HR
manager is decorating the store?

01:41.202 --> 01:42.501
I wouldn't think that would be

01:42.536 --> 01:44.670
on her list of job
responsibilities.

01:44.705 --> 01:46.438
Well no, of course
not, but, umm-

01:46.474 --> 01:48.140
I volunteered to help.

01:48.175 --> 01:49.942
It's three weeks
until Christmas.

01:49.977 --> 01:52.678
So all hands on deck...
the halls!

01:53.714 --> 01:56.115
Well, I'm half expecting Santa's
elves to appear

01:56.150 --> 01:57.249
and burst into song,

01:57.284 --> 02:02.020
so I think we can assume
the halls are fully decked.

02:02.056 --> 02:03.155
And besides, shouldn't you
be working

02:03.190 --> 02:07.292
on the Christmas charity gala
for the fire station?

02:07.328 --> 02:08.827
I have already talked
to Captain Pearson

02:08.863 --> 02:11.196
and we're meeting this week.

02:11.232 --> 02:14.366
Fulton's is the major sponsor
for the first time this year,

02:14.401 --> 02:16.969
so we have to make
a good impression.

02:17.004 --> 02:17.803
<i>Think tasteful.</i>

02:17.838 --> 02:18.537
<i>Elegant.</i>

02:18.572 --> 02:19.438
<i>Refined.</i>

02:19.473 --> 02:21.974
I'll make sure it's
all taken care of.

02:23.244 --> 02:24.710
Are you sure everything's
taken care of?

02:24.745 --> 02:26.211
This is very important, Noelle.

02:26.247 --> 02:28.547
Alex, don't worry.

02:28.582 --> 02:31.483
Besides, a fancy charity gala

02:31.519 --> 02:35.187
means I have an excuse to buy
a new pair of shoes.

02:35.222 --> 02:37.322
Everyone should have someone in
their life who looks at them

02:37.358 --> 02:39.057
the way you look at footwear.

02:39.093 --> 02:41.527
But they're more than
just footwear.

02:41.562 --> 02:43.529
I mean they are an expression
of our mood.

02:43.564 --> 02:48.233
They're... they're happy or
serious or fun or flirty.

02:48.269 --> 02:48.867
Heh.

02:48.903 --> 02:50.869
Every pair tells a story.

02:50.905 --> 02:52.571
Well just make sure the story
they tell

02:52.606 --> 02:55.073
is one my mother
will approve of.

02:55.109 --> 02:56.375
Alex, I promise.

02:56.410 --> 02:59.878
The shoes, and the fire station
gala will be

02:59.914 --> 03:01.914
tasteful, elegant and refined.

03:01.949 --> 03:03.682
Thank you so much.

03:05.000 --> 03:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:13.460 --> 03:15.727
Nice work out there Jake.

03:15.763 --> 03:16.862
I especially liked the part
where you slide down

03:16.897 --> 03:19.698
the fire escape to getkto tck.

03:19.733 --> 03:22.134
Well, it was faster than taking
the stairs and more fun.

03:22.169 --> 03:24.169
But not exactly
appropriate behaviour

03:24.205 --> 03:25.837
for a future deputy chief.

03:25.873 --> 03:27.039
Hey!

03:27.074 --> 03:29.374
Can we do Secret Santa for
our Christmas party this year?

03:29.410 --> 03:31.009
Peter, in all the years
that you've known me,

03:31.045 --> 03:33.312
has changing the subject
ever worked?

03:33.347 --> 03:34.479
Never.

03:34.515 --> 03:36.048
Look Teddy it's not
a done deal yet.

03:36.083 --> 03:38.650
I don't want to talk about it
and jinx it.

03:38.686 --> 03:40.219
You sure it's not because
you're having second thoughts?

03:40.254 --> 03:41.820
Yeah, I mean it's an office job,
Jake.

03:41.855 --> 03:44.056
You're not going to miss being
out on the front lines with us?

03:44.091 --> 03:45.224
It's called a career path.

03:45.626 --> 03:47.893
Can't slide down fire escapes
for the rest of my life.

03:47.928 --> 03:48.827
Why not?

03:48.862 --> 03:49.895
Lots of people do.

03:49.930 --> 03:51.730
Your dad did.

03:51.765 --> 03:52.831
Yeah.

03:52.866 --> 03:55.000
My dad the hero firefighter.

03:55.035 --> 03:56.702
But, it's time I grow up.

03:56.737 --> 03:57.970
Do my own thing.

03:58.005 --> 04:00.839
The only bad part is how much
you guys are going to miss me.

04:00.874 --> 04:03.075
Oh, I think we'd find a way
to muddle through.

04:03.110 --> 04:04.076
Nah.

04:04.111 --> 04:05.577
You guys are going to be
devastated without me.

04:05.613 --> 04:06.378
It's gonna kill ya!

04:06.413 --> 04:07.713
Yeah just for that
you're stowing

04:07.748 --> 04:08.747
the rest of the equipment.

04:08.782 --> 04:09.748
Sorry.

04:09.783 --> 04:11.383
No can do.

04:11.418 --> 04:14.052
I'm, uh, moving into
my new place tonight.

04:18.291 --> 04:20.058
Ahh, a Christmas shoe tree?

04:20.094 --> 04:21.593
Lorna I love it.

04:21.629 --> 04:22.594
I knew you would.

04:22.630 --> 04:23.662
Here.

04:25.099 --> 04:27.899
You know, a picture of
this would be inspiring.

04:27.935 --> 04:31.036
Maybe even the most inspiring
photo of the year?

04:31.071 --> 04:32.571
Oh, Lorna come on.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.439
You need to enter the contest
this year.

04:34.475 --> 04:36.541
They're showing entries at
the Christmas charity gala.

04:36.577 --> 04:37.943
So it's like kismet.

04:37.978 --> 04:39.778
I haven't taken photographs
in years.

04:39.813 --> 04:43.882
Submit the one of the woman
by the Christmas tree.

04:43.917 --> 04:45.584
That is a great picture.

04:45.619 --> 04:47.119
You're a great photographer.

04:47.154 --> 04:48.453
Yeah, well I gave that up.

04:48.489 --> 04:51.957
Now, I am a great Human
Resources Manager.

04:51.992 --> 04:53.292
When I recommended you
for this job

04:53.327 --> 04:55.127
it was supposed to be temporary.

04:55.162 --> 04:56.395
Just somethin' to help you
pay the bills

04:56.430 --> 04:59.731
while you got over
What's-his-face.

04:59.767 --> 05:01.066
His name is Matt.

05:01.101 --> 05:01.767
I know.

05:01.802 --> 05:04.069
I just prefer What's-his-face.

05:04.104 --> 05:06.305
Noelle, that was
three years ago.

05:06.340 --> 05:07.739
You need to get over him.

05:07.775 --> 05:09.975
I am over him.

05:10.010 --> 05:12.444
You still follow his Instagram.

05:12.479 --> 05:13.679
He's still a photographer.

05:13.714 --> 05:16.581
Sweetie, it is time for you
to get back out in the world.

05:16.617 --> 05:18.483
Personally, and professionally.

05:18.519 --> 05:19.951
Lorna, this may not be
my dream job

05:19.987 --> 05:21.920
but I am making the best of it.

05:21.955 --> 05:25.257
Noelle, you know I love you.

05:25.292 --> 05:28.627
But this isn't a time for you
to be making the best of it.

05:28.662 --> 05:33.498
It's a time for you to be filled
with the spirit of Christmas.

05:33.534 --> 05:34.933
We work in retail.

05:34.968 --> 05:38.837
I'm just trying to get through
Christmas alive.

05:38.872 --> 05:40.839
I appreciate what
you're trying to do,

05:40.874 --> 05:42.774
but I promise, I'm okay.

05:42.810 --> 05:46.311
I work with great people,
my dad and I are good.

05:46.347 --> 05:47.946
And I have a best friend
like you.

05:48.882 --> 05:49.815
You're only saying that

05:49.850 --> 05:52.317
because I always get you
shoes for Christmas.

05:52.353 --> 05:54.586
No, it's because I love you.

05:56.357 --> 05:58.824
And because of the shoes.

05:58.859 --> 06:00.025
Okay.

06:00.060 --> 06:02.127
This year, I'm gonna
switch it up.

06:02.162 --> 06:03.662
I'm thinkin' boots.

06:03.697 --> 06:05.864
Like those black ones
you used to have.

06:05.899 --> 06:06.865
Yes.

06:06.900 --> 06:08.166
I loved those.

06:13.207 --> 06:14.673
<i>Merry Christmas, Mrs. Claus.</i>

06:40.200 --> 06:41.166
<i>Hey dad!</i>

06:41.201 --> 06:42.834
<i>You never visit on a Tuesday.</i>

06:42.870 --> 06:46.071
I'm sure that at some point
I've come on a Tuesday.

06:46.106 --> 06:48.240
You call on Friday
and you visit on a Sunday.

06:48.275 --> 06:49.241
The only time you visit
on a Tuesday

06:49.276 --> 06:52.878
is if it's a holiday or
if something's wrong.

06:52.913 --> 06:55.180
Actually, uh, I mean there
is something.

06:55.215 --> 06:55.714
I-

06:55.749 --> 06:56.581
That's what I mean!

06:56.617 --> 06:58.717
That's what I mean!!

06:58.752 --> 06:59.551
Sorry.

06:59.586 --> 07:01.586
Uh, there is what?

07:01.622 --> 07:03.221
Uh, oh nothin'.

07:03.257 --> 07:04.389
It's...

07:17.304 --> 07:20.205
You two loved
to play dress up.

07:20.240 --> 07:21.039
And her shoes.

07:21.074 --> 07:22.474
We could've had a much
bigger house

07:22.509 --> 07:25.744
if it hadn't been for your
mother and her shoes.

07:25.779 --> 07:28.613
Yeah, it runs in the family.

07:28.649 --> 07:31.283
Still love the necklace?

07:31.318 --> 07:33.218
I do.

07:33.253 --> 07:35.454
I never see you wear it.

07:35.489 --> 07:38.056
Oh, it never goes with my shoes.

07:39.493 --> 07:40.459
Ya hungry?

07:40.494 --> 07:41.126
I could, um-

07:41.161 --> 07:42.093
No! No.

07:42.129 --> 07:43.595
I'm... I'm fine.

07:43.630 --> 07:45.230
I, you know, I should get going.

07:45.265 --> 07:46.398
You just got here!

07:46.433 --> 07:50.402
Yeah, but you're busy and
I don't want to bother you.

07:50.437 --> 07:52.604
I'll just, uh,
I'll call you Friday.

07:52.639 --> 07:53.638
And see ya Sunday!

07:53.674 --> 07:54.706
Yeah.

07:55.642 --> 08:00.278
Noelle, you sure
nothing's wrong?

08:00.314 --> 08:01.813
Yeah, I'm sure.

08:01.849 --> 08:03.315
Bye, dad.

08:03.350 --> 08:04.749
Bye.

08:25.038 --> 08:26.304
Oh! Careful! Careful.

08:26.340 --> 08:27.606
Oh.

08:27.641 --> 08:28.840
Careful.

08:28.876 --> 08:29.774
Here let me, I'll move
some of these.

08:29.810 --> 08:30.976
I'm... I'm fine. I'm...

08:31.011 --> 08:31.810
Oh!

08:33.746 --> 08:34.946
Is this your obstacle course?

08:34.982 --> 08:38.149
Yeah, I'm sorry,
I'm moving into 3G.

08:38.184 --> 08:40.485
Oh, I, uh, live in 2G.

08:40.520 --> 08:41.785
Oh! 2G.

08:41.822 --> 08:45.490
I promise not to hold it
over you.

08:45.526 --> 08:47.959
'Cause my apartment's...
it's over.

08:47.995 --> 08:49.628
Yeah, I... I get it.

08:49.663 --> 08:50.428
I get it.

08:50.464 --> 08:51.363
Hey, let me help you
with those.

08:51.398 --> 08:52.230
Oh, I, I can-

08:52.266 --> 08:53.532
Really, it's the least
that I can do.

08:53.567 --> 08:54.466
Here, no-

08:54.501 --> 08:55.133
I can really manage.

08:55.168 --> 08:55.700
Woah!

08:55.736 --> 08:56.635
Woah!

08:58.839 --> 08:59.771
Ah.

09:01.241 --> 09:04.709
I'm really making a great
first impression.

09:04.745 --> 09:06.545
Not going to forget
this anytime soon.

09:06.580 --> 09:08.280
I, I got it.

09:10.183 --> 09:13.652
I'm Jake, by the way.

09:13.687 --> 09:15.153
Noelle.

09:15.188 --> 09:17.222
As in the first!

09:17.257 --> 09:19.190
First... Noelle.

09:22.095 --> 09:24.129
I'll just call you 2G.

09:26.867 --> 09:33.204
<i>♪♪♪</i>

09:33.240 --> 09:34.406
Oh, Noelle!

09:34.441 --> 09:35.473
I need a favour.

09:35.509 --> 09:39.077
Can you find an old employee
file from the 1990s?

09:39.112 --> 09:40.245
Oh.

09:40.280 --> 09:41.313
Hmm.

09:41.348 --> 09:43.582
Well everything back to 2000
is on the computer,

09:43.617 --> 09:46.851
but anything before that would
be paper files in the basement.

09:46.887 --> 09:49.554
Hmm... I wouldn't ask
if it wasn't important.

09:49.590 --> 09:52.190
It's part of a Christmas gift
for my mother.

09:52.225 --> 09:54.059
An old employee file?

09:54.094 --> 09:55.727
Wouldn't she prefer a sweater?

09:55.762 --> 09:56.795
Well, it's about the people

09:56.830 --> 09:59.698
who used to work here
when my dad ran the store.

09:59.733 --> 10:02.601
I'm getting some old photos
and some funny stories

10:02.636 --> 10:04.936
and I'm putting it all
into an album for her.

10:04.972 --> 10:06.771
Aww, that's so sweet.

10:06.807 --> 10:11.443
Uh, the employee, it is,
uh, Charlene Pennymar.

10:11.478 --> 10:12.377
Oh.

10:12.412 --> 10:13.712
I'll see what I can find.

10:13.747 --> 10:14.412
Thank you.

10:14.448 --> 10:15.246
Mm-hmm.

10:15.282 --> 10:17.449
It is really coming
down out there.

10:17.484 --> 10:19.451
Hope you didn't have
any big plans for tonight.

10:19.486 --> 10:21.786
Oh, no my Christmas tree
came this morning,

10:21.822 --> 10:23.622
so I'm just putting on
my comfy pyjamas

10:23.657 --> 10:25.290
and putting up the decorations.

10:25.325 --> 10:26.391
Good plan.

10:26.426 --> 10:27.225
I'll see you tomorrow?

10:27.260 --> 10:28.059
Yes, you will.

10:28.095 --> 10:28.793
Great.

10:28.829 --> 10:29.628
Be safe out there.

10:29.663 --> 10:30.729
I will.

10:55.322 --> 10:57.288
Hunh.

11:11.471 --> 11:15.340
Where are you,
Charlene Pennymar?

11:15.375 --> 11:18.443
Wherever you are, you're going
to stay here 'til tomorrow.

11:23.150 --> 11:24.482
Hello?

11:26.887 --> 11:28.987
Hello? Anybody here?

11:34.394 --> 11:36.928
Where is everybody?

11:57.250 --> 11:58.049
Hello.

11:58.085 --> 11:59.050
<i>Alex.</i>

11:59.086 --> 12:00.218
<i>Hey, it's Noelle.</i>

12:00.253 --> 12:01.986
The store is empty,
and dark

12:02.022 --> 12:04.155
and all the doors are locked.

12:04.191 --> 12:06.991
We shut down early
because of all the snow.

12:07.027 --> 12:08.393
I sent everyone home.

12:08.428 --> 12:09.394
Alex!

12:09.429 --> 12:12.030
I was in the basement,
looking for that file.

12:12.065 --> 12:13.531
<i>Oh, no.</i>

12:13.567 --> 12:15.166
Noelle I am so sorry.

12:15.202 --> 12:16.835
I had no idea you were
still down there.

12:16.870 --> 12:19.037
Well, I mean, just tell me
how I can get out

12:19.072 --> 12:20.238
'cause I don't have a key.

12:20.273 --> 12:23.074
There is no way out without one.

12:23.110 --> 12:24.909
Okay Alex, what am I gonna do?

12:24.945 --> 12:26.010
<i>It's okay.</i>

12:26.113 --> 12:27.412
I'm gonna come down there.

12:27.447 --> 12:28.713
Or I will send someone.

12:28.749 --> 12:29.848
Have you even looked outside?

12:29.883 --> 12:31.349
Because it's snowing like crazy.

12:31.384 --> 12:32.917
<i>I will figure it out.</i>

12:32.953 --> 12:34.919
And if I can't, I will just call
the fire department

12:34.955 --> 12:36.688
and we'll get them to break
down the doors.

12:36.723 --> 12:38.923
No, now that's a little extreme.

12:38.959 --> 12:41.726
It's either that or you spend
the night in there by yourself.

12:41.762 --> 12:44.362
There are worse places
to get stuck overnight.

12:44.397 --> 12:46.231
Make yourself at home
until I get there.

12:46.266 --> 12:47.699
But I will get there.

12:47.734 --> 12:49.400
<i>I'm not leaving you in
the store overnight.</i>

12:49.436 --> 12:50.401
Okay.

12:50.437 --> 12:51.936
And be careful out there.

12:51.972 --> 12:54.072
Yeah, will do.

12:57.144 --> 12:58.376
Huh.

12:58.411 --> 13:00.912
Make myself at home, huh?

was supposed to go at all.

14:33.240 --> 14:34.038
What happened?

14:34.074 --> 14:35.540
Well, I was looking
for some shoes,

14:35.575 --> 14:37.542
and they were there on the...
the very tippy top...

14:37.577 --> 14:39.043
So you climbed the rack?

14:39.079 --> 14:41.179
Well, they're very important
shoes, they...

14:41.214 --> 14:42.213
they go with my...

14:42.249 --> 14:45.516
Wait, who are you and how did
you get in here?

14:45.552 --> 14:47.018
I'm Charlie.

14:47.053 --> 14:48.052
And, and it, it is just...

14:48.088 --> 14:52.390
Oh gosh, it's just so nice
to meet you, Noelle.

14:52.425 --> 14:53.725
Wait, how did you know
my name?

14:53.760 --> 14:55.393
Oh, I know lots of stuff
about you.

14:55.428 --> 14:57.495
I... I've been watching you.

14:58.899 --> 14:59.831
It's okay, don't worry,

14:59.866 --> 15:02.066
they... they said that
you'd be skeptical.

15:02.102 --> 15:03.701
Are "they" doctors?

15:03.737 --> 15:05.737
They said "she'll think
you're crazy."

15:05.772 --> 15:08.039
Well, whoever they are,
they were right.

15:08.074 --> 15:09.707
Well... well of course
they were.

15:09.743 --> 15:12.076
They've been doing this
a long time.

15:12.112 --> 15:15.013
I... I'm new to all of this.

15:15.048 --> 15:16.414
New to what?

15:16.449 --> 15:18.883
Well, I'm here to...

15:18.919 --> 15:20.752
Help... help you... um.

15:20.787 --> 15:22.854
Sorry I have to look
at my notes...

15:22.889 --> 15:25.757
Um... to help you overcome
your troubles, of course.

15:25.792 --> 15:27.892
Oh, but I'm not troubled.

15:27.928 --> 15:29.894
Well, you... you must
be because,

15:29.930 --> 15:31.429
I wouldn't be here
if you weren't.

15:31.464 --> 15:33.097
It was Alex who sent you here

15:33.133 --> 15:34.732
with the key to have
a little fun.

15:34.768 --> 15:36.367
Ha ha.

15:36.403 --> 15:37.602
Very funny, Alex.

15:37.637 --> 15:38.770
No, I'm here to help.

15:38.805 --> 15:40.038
Help with what?

15:40.073 --> 15:43.074
You see dear, it seems that at
some point you stopped trying.

15:43.109 --> 15:45.076
You stopped pursuing
the things in your life

15:45.111 --> 15:47.278
that meant something to you.

15:47.314 --> 15:49.047
What are you talking about?

15:49.082 --> 15:52.617
No, I am here because something
big is coming.

15:52.652 --> 15:57.922
And if you miss it this time,
it could be the last time.

15:57.958 --> 15:58.957
What is it?

15:58.992 --> 15:59.924
That I can't tell you.

15:59.960 --> 16:00.725
Why not?

16:00.760 --> 16:02.293
Employee manual.

16:02.329 --> 16:04.095
That part I remember.

16:04.130 --> 16:07.899
Well then how are you gonna
help me if ya' can't tell me.

16:07.934 --> 16:11.903
Well, okay, see that's why I was
climbing up the... uh... uh...

16:11.938 --> 16:14.272
shoe shelf, because
when you were little

16:14.307 --> 16:16.107
you used to go shoe shopping
with your mother.

16:16.142 --> 16:18.977
And then you would go home
and you would play dress up.

16:19.012 --> 16:20.144
How did you know that?

16:20.180 --> 16:21.913
And then when you put
the shoes on

16:21.948 --> 16:26.951
you would dream about
all the possibilities.

16:30.123 --> 16:31.622
Put these on.

16:33.827 --> 16:35.460
Why?

16:35.495 --> 16:37.829
Because, well,
you've lost faith.

16:37.864 --> 16:39.597
And, it's like you know
it's there

16:39.632 --> 16:44.302
but it's like you don't
really consider it anymore.

16:44.337 --> 16:46.504
Every pair tells a story.

16:46.539 --> 16:48.906
Don't you want to see
what this one is?

16:51.378 --> 16:53.144
You know, I had a pair
just like these.

16:53.179 --> 16:54.479
I know.

17:11.664 --> 17:14.132
Okay, I put the shoes on?

17:18.070 --> 17:19.037
What just...

17:19.071 --> 17:21.372
Yes! Yes, it worked!

17:21.407 --> 17:23.808
Now we go back
to Christmas past.

17:23.843 --> 17:25.343
Wait what, where...

17:25.377 --> 17:28.212
It's Christmas Eve.

17:28.248 --> 17:29.147
Three years ago.

17:29.182 --> 17:31.215
Do you remember?

17:31.251 --> 17:32.050
My tree.

17:32.085 --> 17:34.385
I... I haven't decorated
my tree yet.

17:34.421 --> 17:35.086
Oh, oh, no, no.

17:35.121 --> 17:36.287
That... that's a different tree.

17:36.322 --> 17:38.823
This is your tree
three years ago.

17:38.858 --> 17:41.225
Maybe this will help
you remember.

17:42.062 --> 17:43.594
Okay, I got
wine and ice cream.

17:43.630 --> 17:46.831
I didn't know what type of
breakup comfort food you need.

17:46.866 --> 17:47.665
Lorna?

17:47.700 --> 17:49.300
Oh, don't worry,
she can't see me.

17:49.335 --> 17:51.903
I can't believe that Matt broke
up with you on Christmas Eve.

17:51.938 --> 17:53.905
Who does that?

17:53.940 --> 17:55.073
What's-his-face.

17:55.108 --> 17:57.175
You called Matt What's-his-face.

17:57.210 --> 17:58.376
That's good.

18:01.047 --> 18:02.413
Never say his name again.

18:02.449 --> 18:03.414
I like it.

18:03.450 --> 18:04.382
Go with it.

18:04.417 --> 18:05.583
You'll remember everything.

18:05.618 --> 18:07.051
You're better off without him.

18:07.087 --> 18:10.221
You think so?

18:10.256 --> 18:11.422
I said "you think so?"

18:11.458 --> 18:12.890
I remember saying that.

18:12.926 --> 18:14.892
What?

18:14.928 --> 18:16.094
Nothing.

18:16.129 --> 18:17.528
He was holding you back.

18:17.564 --> 18:19.564
You're a much better
photographer without him.

18:21.801 --> 18:23.734
That picture...

18:23.770 --> 18:25.236
is incredible.

18:25.271 --> 18:26.771
Where did you take it?

18:26.806 --> 18:31.542
Oh, at the tree lighting
ceremony downtown last year.

18:31.578 --> 18:35.046
I don't even know who she is.
I just thought she looked so...

18:35.081 --> 18:36.714
I don't know... hopeful.

18:36.749 --> 18:37.715
You know what,

18:37.750 --> 18:41.786
I'm gonna call my friend
that owns that gallery.

18:41.821 --> 18:44.122
I don't need a gallery show,
I need a job.

18:44.157 --> 18:46.958
I can't be Matt's assistant
on photo shoots anymore.

18:46.993 --> 18:49.460
You can go out on your own.

18:49.496 --> 18:50.595
I'll call my friend right now.

18:50.630 --> 18:54.232
No Lorna, please don't.
Don't. Not yet.

18:54.267 --> 18:56.734
You know, is the department
store hiring?

18:56.769 --> 18:58.903
There might be something
in human resources.

18:58.938 --> 19:01.139
But you don't really want
to do that, do you?

19:01.174 --> 19:02.473
I mean, it would
just be temporary.

19:02.509 --> 19:03.941
Okay.

19:03.977 --> 19:06.277
As long as it's just temporary.

19:07.680 --> 19:09.480
But it wasn't temporary,
was it?

19:09.516 --> 19:11.449
That was three years ago
and you're still there.

19:11.484 --> 19:13.918
And you never had your friend
call the gallery owner.

19:13.953 --> 19:15.786
And I believe that this was
the night that you put away

19:15.822 --> 19:17.955
all your camera equipment.

19:17.991 --> 19:19.757
Okay. I don't understand.

19:19.792 --> 19:21.993
Just, what's the point
of all this?

19:22.028 --> 19:24.428
To imagine the possibilities.

19:24.464 --> 19:26.464
Okay.

19:26.499 --> 19:28.900
As long as it's just temporary.

19:30.170 --> 19:33.471
How many times in your life
do you get a do-over?

19:37.377 --> 19:38.409
You know what?

19:38.444 --> 19:41.179
Go ahead and call your friend,
the gallery owner.

19:41.214 --> 19:42.747
Atta girl!

19:47.220 --> 19:48.085
Oh!

19:48.121 --> 19:52.523
Sorry dear, uh, that jump
made me dizzy.

19:52.559 --> 19:54.492
<i>I haven't got the hang
of it yet.</i>

19:54.527 --> 19:55.826
Where are we?

19:55.862 --> 19:59.197
Ohhh...

19:59.232 --> 20:00.998
Ohh-hoo-hoo!

20:01.034 --> 20:04.135
You're right where
you should be.

20:04.170 --> 20:06.204
This is exactly where
you would be today

20:06.239 --> 20:07.538
if you had made
different choices.

20:07.574 --> 20:10.841
Celebrating Christmas
in your new apartment.

20:10.877 --> 20:13.177
You'd have a fabulous
photography studio.

20:13.213 --> 20:14.979
Wait... my studio?

20:15.014 --> 20:16.047
Oh yes, yes, yes.

20:16.082 --> 20:19.517
You are one of the most
sought-after photographers

20:19.552 --> 20:21.219
in the whole city.

20:21.254 --> 20:22.887
Wait.

20:22.922 --> 20:27.225
Is, is this a wedding ring?

20:27.260 --> 20:29.060
Certainly is.

20:30.096 --> 20:31.996
<i>Hey, honey! I'm home.</i>

20:33.700 --> 20:35.166
Whoo!

20:36.603 --> 20:38.236
That was fun!

20:38.271 --> 20:40.238
It was like a rollercoaster.

20:40.273 --> 20:41.339
<i>Oh, I miss rollercoasters.</i>

20:41.374 --> 20:43.074
What... What just happened?

20:43.109 --> 20:45.843
See, well, I knocked over
that shoe rack and you were all

20:45.878 --> 20:46.811
"who are you?"

20:46.846 --> 20:48.879
And then I was like all
"I'm here to help!"

20:48.915 --> 20:51.749
No, I mean, I mean,
how, how did you just...

20:51.784 --> 20:54.385
I mean... what did you...

20:54.420 --> 20:56.354
Oh, I think I'm gonna
freak out now.

20:56.389 --> 20:58.022
Oh, that's quite understandable.

21:01.561 --> 21:02.994
Don't move!

21:07.467 --> 21:08.899
<i>I'm right here!</i>

21:11.471 --> 21:14.071
It's okay, we'll have
it open in a minute.

21:21.114 --> 21:23.914
The manager gave me
the alarm code.

21:35.261 --> 21:36.127
That's better.

21:36.162 --> 21:37.795
You all right?

21:37.830 --> 21:39.397
I don't know, I'm...

21:39.432 --> 21:42.466
I'm not sure.

21:42.502 --> 21:44.769
There's a woman back there.

21:44.804 --> 21:45.469
We'll go find her.

21:45.505 --> 21:47.238
She's in the shoe department.

21:47.273 --> 21:48.239
But be careful.

21:48.274 --> 21:53.644
And whatever she says,
do not put the shoes on.

21:53.680 --> 21:54.745
Okay.

21:59.485 --> 22:00.451
2G!

22:03.523 --> 22:05.089
You're a fireman?

22:05.124 --> 22:08.626
Well, I hope so or I'd feel
pretty silly in this getup.

22:10.963 --> 22:12.596
Not a jokin' mood.

22:14.634 --> 22:16.500
Somethin' happened?

22:16.536 --> 22:17.501
Yeah.

22:17.537 --> 22:19.303
Something definitely happened.

22:21.874 --> 22:25.343
There's a weird lady
in the shoe department.

22:25.378 --> 22:26.977
Okay.

22:27.013 --> 22:29.180
Weird how?

22:29.215 --> 22:35.453
Well it's, oh, it's kind of hard
to explain.

22:35.488 --> 22:36.687
Don't look at me like that.

22:36.723 --> 22:38.856
She's the weird one.

22:38.891 --> 22:41.826
Got it. I'll make a note.

22:41.861 --> 22:43.694
There's no one in
the shoe department.

22:43.730 --> 22:45.363
The rest of the crew
is looking around but...

22:45.398 --> 22:46.997
No, no. No, no.

22:47.033 --> 22:48.466
She's there.

22:48.501 --> 22:51.869
She had a big red,
wacky hat.

22:51.904 --> 22:55.806
I'm sorry but we haven't found
anyone in here but you.

23:00.680 --> 23:01.512
Not the weird one.

23:01.547 --> 23:02.513
Got it.

23:04.250 --> 23:05.683
Cute antlers.

23:09.088 --> 23:10.054
You know her?

23:10.089 --> 23:10.988
Yeah.

23:11.023 --> 23:12.556
She's my new neighbour.

23:12.592 --> 23:13.324
Ah.

23:13.359 --> 23:14.225
Good luck with that!

23:14.260 --> 23:15.159
Yeah.

23:15.194 --> 23:16.861
<i>Alright, let's go!</i>

23:16.896 --> 23:18.329
All right.

23:26.639 --> 23:28.706
Hey, what's going on out here?

23:29.642 --> 23:32.743
Oh, now you're in trouble!

23:34.447 --> 23:36.113
Oh! Oh!

23:36.149 --> 23:37.448
Okay.

23:37.483 --> 23:38.215
Ooh.

23:38.251 --> 23:42.286
Oh. Oh. Oh.

23:42.321 --> 23:43.921
Oh. Oh.

23:43.956 --> 23:44.922
Oh!

23:45.825 --> 23:46.624
Make a break for it, boys!

23:46.659 --> 23:48.359
It's too late for me!

23:50.430 --> 23:53.130
I... I'm so sorry.

23:53.166 --> 23:54.465
Yeah, it's okay.

23:54.500 --> 23:56.567
Boys will be boys, right?

23:56.602 --> 23:57.968
How are you feeling today?

23:58.004 --> 23:59.403
Uh, good.

23:59.439 --> 24:01.405
Yeah. Better. Fine.

24:01.441 --> 24:02.473
I'm not weird.

24:02.508 --> 24:03.307
Oh.

24:03.342 --> 24:05.142
I never said you were.

24:05.178 --> 24:06.644
But you thought it.

24:06.679 --> 24:09.980
You did have on
reindeer antlers.

24:10.016 --> 24:11.215
True.

24:11.250 --> 24:12.850
But I mean you were trapped
inside a big store by yourself

24:12.885 --> 24:16.987
in the middle of a snow storm so
that would put anybody on edge.

24:17.023 --> 24:18.088
Thank you for that.

24:18.124 --> 24:19.423
You're welcome.

24:19.459 --> 24:21.158
Hey, you're with
the fire station

24:21.194 --> 24:22.993
that's doing the Christmas
gala, right?

24:23.029 --> 24:24.628
Yeah, are you coming?

24:24.664 --> 24:28.332
Well, Fulton's is sponsoring it
so I volunteered to oversee it.

24:28.367 --> 24:30.167
Really?

24:30.203 --> 24:30.935
What?

24:30.970 --> 24:32.436
Nothing. Nothing.

24:32.472 --> 24:33.704
Wow.

24:33.739 --> 24:36.507
For a guy who doesn't say a lot
of things you sure do say a lot.

24:36.542 --> 24:38.676
You know what I'm saying.

24:38.711 --> 24:40.444
I'm just saying it's, uh,
it's a really big deal

24:40.480 --> 24:41.145
for the fire station.

24:41.180 --> 24:42.980
It raises a lot of money for us.

24:43.015 --> 24:44.248
Yeah, I know.

24:44.283 --> 24:47.518
That's why I am determined to
make sure it's a big success.

24:47.553 --> 24:51.622
In fact, I, here, need to call
Captain Pearson right now.

24:57.196 --> 24:58.696
Hi! Captain Pearson.

24:58.731 --> 25:00.030
Noelle Carpenter.

25:00.066 --> 25:01.599
Good, thank you.

25:01.634 --> 25:04.168
I was calling to see when you'd
have time to get together

25:04.203 --> 25:07.137
for the charity gala.

25:07.173 --> 25:08.005
Oh?

25:08.040 --> 25:11.008
Okay, then who will I be
working with?

25:13.746 --> 25:18.182
No, I think I know how
to find him.

25:18.217 --> 25:20.284
Thank you.

25:21.721 --> 25:23.721
Know where to find who?

25:23.756 --> 25:28.359
Your captain just
volunteered you.

25:28.394 --> 25:30.227
Well I guess we're
working together.

25:30.263 --> 25:31.695
Looks like it.

25:33.766 --> 25:35.566
Isn't that...

25:35.601 --> 25:36.634
Weird?

25:38.371 --> 25:40.204
I'll get the door for ya.

25:48.915 --> 25:50.581
Okay.

25:50.616 --> 25:52.850
How are you doing this?

25:52.885 --> 25:58.923
How are you just showing up
whenever and wherever you want?

25:58.958 --> 26:02.526
Well, no I can't just like
"show up" anywhere.

26:02.562 --> 26:03.928
You know, there are rules.

26:03.963 --> 26:06.096
Well, what are they then?

26:06.132 --> 26:08.399
Well, I'm still learning them.

26:08.434 --> 26:10.434
Oh great!

26:10.469 --> 26:12.937
So people can see you
or can't see you?

26:12.972 --> 26:14.038
Oh no, no.

26:14.073 --> 26:15.172
That one I remember.

26:15.207 --> 26:17.741
No. People cannot see me
when we take our little jaunts

26:17.777 --> 26:19.009
into your memories.

26:19.045 --> 26:21.579
See I wasn't there, you know,
when they originally happened

26:21.614 --> 26:25.716
so I can't be seen there
when you relive them.

26:25.751 --> 26:26.684
But I'm here now.

26:26.719 --> 26:31.622
So you're like a...
because I mean... I...

26:31.657 --> 26:33.757
Well, I can... I can touch you.

26:33.793 --> 26:34.558
Of course!

26:36.128 --> 26:37.895
See, I'm just as here
as you are.

26:37.930 --> 26:40.431
Yeah but apparently you don't
need doors to get in and out.

26:40.466 --> 26:42.299
Well, that's just one of
the perks of the job.

26:42.335 --> 26:45.102
Okay. I still don't understand
why you're here.

26:45.137 --> 26:47.638
Okay.

26:47.673 --> 26:49.406
There's only two and a half
weeks 'til Christmas.

26:49.442 --> 26:51.942
There's a lot of work to do.

26:51.978 --> 26:53.077
What kind of work?

26:53.112 --> 26:55.479
First, you can start by spending
as much time as possible

26:55.514 --> 26:56.981
with that handsome fireman,
Jake,

26:57.016 --> 26:58.816
working on the charity gala.

26:58.851 --> 27:00.918
Well... how do you know a...

27:02.855 --> 27:04.655
Did you have something
to do with...

27:04.690 --> 27:07.491
putting us together to work?

27:07.526 --> 27:08.292
Wait!

27:08.327 --> 27:10.594
Is he the guy that
I'm married to?

27:10.630 --> 27:11.996
Is he the "honey,
I'm home" guy?

27:12.031 --> 27:14.465
Now, don't go getting ahead
of yourself.

27:14.500 --> 27:18.969
No, thinking that you know you
know before you... you know...

27:19.005 --> 27:23.807
now that... that's a... that's a
sure-fire way of never knowing.

27:23.843 --> 27:25.109
You know?

27:25.144 --> 27:26.677
No.

27:26.712 --> 27:30.280
And regardless, I am not looking
for a romance.

27:30.316 --> 27:31.615
Romance?

27:31.651 --> 27:32.983
Who said anything
about a romance?

27:33.019 --> 27:34.685
What you saw in that future?

27:34.720 --> 27:36.787
That was just one possibility

27:36.822 --> 27:37.888
but you have the power
to change that

27:37.923 --> 27:40.357
by what you do or what
you don't do and let's face it,

27:40.393 --> 27:42.626
you haven't done much
of anything lately.

27:42.662 --> 27:44.294
So, go out and live your life!

27:44.330 --> 27:45.696
Have fun!

27:45.731 --> 27:47.798
Embrace the Christmas spirit.

27:47.833 --> 27:50.134
Well, yeah, but all we're doing
is planning a party.

27:50.169 --> 27:51.969
It's just not all that exciting.

27:54.907 --> 27:55.773
Noelle.

27:55.808 --> 27:58.308
We're talking about having
faith here.

27:58.344 --> 28:00.678
You seemed to have lost
some of yours.

28:00.713 --> 28:02.946
But we're going to help you
find it.

28:05.751 --> 28:06.950
Now she uses the door.

28:06.986 --> 28:09.553
Well, I... I... I can... I can do
the other thing... if you...

28:09.588 --> 28:10.988
I mean if that's your
favourite... I can do the...

28:11.023 --> 28:11.722
No.

28:11.757 --> 28:12.489
No, no.

28:12.525 --> 28:13.390
Door is fine.

28:13.426 --> 28:14.458
Okay.

28:15.594 --> 28:18.062
When will I see you again?

28:18.097 --> 28:19.396
When you need me.

28:25.404 --> 28:27.571
We usually put the stage
over here,

28:27.606 --> 28:28.672
dance floor in front.

28:28.708 --> 28:31.408
Tables all around and the, um,

28:31.444 --> 28:34.411
silent auction and photo contest
display can go over there.

28:34.447 --> 28:36.213
Photo contest?

28:36.248 --> 28:38.682
Oh, the most inspiring
photo of the year.

28:38.718 --> 28:39.917
Yeah, all the photos
will be displayed

28:39.952 --> 28:43.053
and then the guests can bid on
them during the silent auction.

28:43.089 --> 28:43.887
Oh, nice.

28:43.923 --> 28:44.888
Mm-hmm.

28:44.924 --> 28:46.724
Looks like you had quite a party
here last night.

28:46.759 --> 28:49.727
Oh, it was a wonderful event.

28:49.762 --> 28:53.097
You know what, maybe we should
use some of this.

28:53.132 --> 28:55.566
Uh, I've been to the gala
before

28:55.601 --> 28:57.401
and it's always elegant
and refined.

28:57.436 --> 28:59.770
Which is why Fulton's
wanted to be involved.

28:59.805 --> 29:02.773
Don't get me wrong,
the gala's always... nice.

29:02.808 --> 29:05.442
But maybe we could...

29:05.478 --> 29:08.378
I don't know... make it
a little less grown up.

29:08.414 --> 29:10.447
Well what do you want,
a kids' party?

29:10.483 --> 29:11.882
Like with dancing snowmen?

29:11.917 --> 29:13.450
Oh! Maybe a snowball fight?

29:13.486 --> 29:16.920
No, but maybe we could...
I don't know, just...

29:16.956 --> 29:18.122
Have a little more fun.

29:18.157 --> 29:19.957
Lighten it up a bit this year.

29:19.992 --> 29:22.092
We have all sorts of
whimsical decorations.

29:22.128 --> 29:24.962
We can do some festive lighting,
special effects.

29:24.997 --> 29:26.930
We can even make it snow
in here.

29:26.966 --> 29:27.731
Snow. Snow.

29:27.767 --> 29:28.665
That would be fun!

29:28.701 --> 29:30.467
Yeah, no, the family
that owns the store,

29:30.503 --> 29:32.102
they don't really do whimsy.

29:32.138 --> 29:34.638
So I say that we just stick
with what we know works.

29:34.673 --> 29:35.305
Simple.

29:35.341 --> 29:36.140
Elegant.

29:36.175 --> 29:37.775
Grown up.

29:37.810 --> 29:40.477
Well, I will let you two
figure it out

29:40.513 --> 29:42.946
and we'll chat more
at our next meeting.

29:42.982 --> 29:43.981
Thank you.

29:44.016 --> 29:45.282
I think we should get going.

29:45.317 --> 29:47.384
I will call a cab.

29:48.654 --> 29:49.586
Hmm.

29:49.622 --> 29:50.988
There's no service in here.

29:51.023 --> 29:53.223
Oh, I'm sure we can find a cab
out front.

29:56.829 --> 29:57.795
Huh.

29:59.031 --> 30:01.064
Why are there no cabs?

30:05.838 --> 30:06.804
Woah!

30:10.209 --> 30:13.243
Well Merry Christmas!
You folks need a ride?

30:14.713 --> 30:16.513
You game?

30:16.549 --> 30:18.849
Sure, let's do it.

30:18.884 --> 30:20.951
Well, ho, ho, ho.

30:20.986 --> 30:22.152
<i>Away we go.</i>

30:24.056 --> 30:25.122
After you.

30:33.833 --> 30:34.832
Ha!

30:37.570 --> 30:38.635
Just our luck.

30:49.548 --> 30:52.382
So, with a name like Noelle you
must go all out for Christmas.

30:52.418 --> 30:53.717
We used to.

30:53.752 --> 30:55.719
All the family holiday
trimmings,

30:55.754 --> 30:58.021
but now I just go over
to my dad's house.

30:58.057 --> 30:59.823
It's a pretty low-key day.

30:59.859 --> 31:00.657
You?

31:00.693 --> 31:02.025
Uh, my brother and I
and his family

31:02.061 --> 31:04.661
go over to my mom's place
Christmas morning.

31:04.697 --> 31:06.363
Presents, food and football.

31:06.398 --> 31:07.497
In that order?

31:07.533 --> 31:09.333
Well, it depends on
who's playing.

31:09.368 --> 31:11.201
Later on in the day we go
to the fire station

31:11.237 --> 31:12.903
for a big feast
with the families.

31:12.938 --> 31:14.238
Oh, that sounds nice.

31:14.273 --> 31:15.873
Yeah.

31:15.908 --> 31:18.242
Yeah, I've been doing it ever
since I was a kid with my dad.

31:18.277 --> 31:20.711
Oh, was your dad
a firefighter too?

31:20.746 --> 31:23.213
Yes. He was the captain
at our station.

31:23.249 --> 31:24.014
Hmm.

31:24.049 --> 31:25.749
Before Pearson.

31:25.784 --> 31:28.018
He was a legend there.

31:28.053 --> 31:30.053
Yeah.

31:30.089 --> 31:33.423
We all miss him,
he passed away.

31:33.459 --> 31:36.059
Oh, I'm sorry.

31:36.095 --> 31:37.761
I know what it's like not
to have a parent around

31:37.796 --> 31:39.429
during the holidays.

31:39.465 --> 31:42.366
My mom passed away
a few years ago.

31:42.401 --> 31:43.600
Hence the low-key Christmas.

31:43.636 --> 31:44.601
Hmm-mm.

31:44.637 --> 31:46.536
Well I'm sorry too.

31:48.908 --> 31:50.774
<i>Oh! You okay?</i>

31:51.577 --> 31:52.542
Yeah, I'm fine.

31:52.578 --> 31:55.612
Sorry about that!
Must've hit a... pothole.

31:55.648 --> 31:56.580
Quite a pothole.

31:56.615 --> 31:58.749
You know what, it's okay.
We'll just walk.

32:00.252 --> 32:03.287
Oh... okay.

32:03.322 --> 32:04.321
Okay.

32:04.356 --> 32:06.256
<i>Rides on me.
Merry Christmas!</i>

32:08.494 --> 32:09.259
Thank you.

32:13.832 --> 32:15.165
Should we walk?

32:15.200 --> 32:15.599
Hmm-mmm.

32:15.634 --> 32:16.466
Ok.

32:18.704 --> 32:19.770
Thanks.

32:25.311 --> 32:28.011
Still don't understand why
we couldn't find any cabs.

32:28.047 --> 32:31.081
Yeah, it was a real mystery.

32:34.553 --> 32:37.154
Listen, um, I was gonna go
get something to eat.

32:37.189 --> 32:39.690
I was wondering if maybe
you want to come with me?

32:39.725 --> 32:42.693
We can see if we have anything
in common?

32:42.728 --> 32:44.361
About the... gala.

32:44.396 --> 32:45.195
Right.

32:45.230 --> 32:46.997
For the gala.

32:47.032 --> 32:48.332
Um.

32:48.367 --> 32:50.133
Well, thanks but I brought
work home.

32:50.169 --> 32:54.137
So, I'll just meet you at the
hotel tomorrow like we planned.

32:54.173 --> 32:54.972
Okay.

32:55.007 --> 32:56.440
See you then.

33:02.181 --> 33:04.047
You really need to stop
doing that.

33:04.083 --> 33:06.183
Why didn't you go with him?!

33:06.218 --> 33:07.551
What difference
does it make?

33:07.586 --> 33:08.385
I told you.

33:08.420 --> 33:09.453
I can't tell you.

33:09.488 --> 33:12.389
I can't keep having these
conversations with you.

33:12.424 --> 33:14.324
I have work to do.

33:35.247 --> 33:37.547
Lorna!

33:54.066 --> 33:57.901
Oh no. Not again.

34:04.910 --> 34:07.144
I just love the hustle
and bustle of everybody

34:07.179 --> 34:09.713
doing last minute shopping!

34:09.748 --> 34:11.014
You!

34:11.050 --> 34:12.716
You tricked me.

34:12.751 --> 34:14.717
You ambushed me with footwear.

34:14.753 --> 34:15.719
soy.

34:15.754 --> 34:17.954
I had to bring you back
to Christmas past again.

34:17.989 --> 34:20.290
And why are you dressed like
Mrs. Claus?

34:20.324 --> 34:23.293
I thought no one could see you
when we went back in time.

34:23.328 --> 34:24.460
Well they can't.

34:25.230 --> 34:27.130
I just... I just
couldn't resist.

34:27.166 --> 34:27.998
I thought it was so cute.

34:28.033 --> 34:29.733
I've always wanted to play
Mrs. Claus

34:29.768 --> 34:30.934
and so I thought that-

34:30.969 --> 34:31.501
Charlie.

34:31.536 --> 34:32.803
What are we doing here?

34:32.838 --> 34:33.904
I'm sorry.

34:33.938 --> 34:35.772
I'm taking you back to a moment
where you didn't fight

34:35.808 --> 34:38.308
for what you really needed
and you missed a chance

34:38.342 --> 34:41.078
that could have
changed everything.

34:41.112 --> 34:44.614
It was Christmas Eve,
two years ago.

34:44.650 --> 34:47.617
I knew these boots
looked familiar.

34:47.652 --> 34:50.420
Should have known Lorna wouldn't
get me the exact same pair.

34:50.456 --> 34:51.554
They're really cute.

34:51.590 --> 34:53.556
I know they are, aren't they?

34:53.592 --> 34:55.725
I usually wore them with
a little cropped pant.

34:55.761 --> 34:56.693
Ooh!

34:56.728 --> 34:57.461
But I think they look pretty
with a skirt-

34:57.496 --> 34:58.095
<i>They do.</i>

34:58.130 --> 34:59.796
No! That's not the point!

34:59.832 --> 35:01.798
What are we doing here?

35:01.834 --> 35:06.236
We are talking to your father.

35:11.510 --> 35:15.112
I was sure... I was sure
this was the right place.

35:15.147 --> 35:17.147
I'm so bad at directions.

35:17.182 --> 35:20.650
Do you have one of those map
things on your phone thingy?

35:20.686 --> 35:22.486
What? No. I.

35:22.521 --> 35:23.820
Oh! There he is.

35:23.856 --> 35:24.921
Whoo. Relief.

35:30.863 --> 35:33.263
Oh, I remember this.

35:33.298 --> 35:35.132
I didn't know he was coming
to the store.

35:35.167 --> 35:36.299
Just go with it.

35:36.335 --> 35:38.568
It'll all come back to you.

35:42.541 --> 35:44.608
<i>Noelle, what are you
doing here?</i>

35:45.878 --> 35:47.344
I work here.

35:47.379 --> 35:49.646
What are you doing here?

35:49.681 --> 35:52.682
I forgot to buy your Aunt June
a Christmas present.

35:52.718 --> 35:53.617
Well why didn't you call me?

35:53.652 --> 35:56.353
We could have gone to eat
or something?

35:56.388 --> 35:58.522
Well I... I didn't want
to bother you.

35:58.557 --> 36:00.690
And besides, we...
we're eating tomorrow.

36:00.726 --> 36:01.391
Christmas dinner?

36:01.426 --> 36:04.995
Yeah, but that doesn't mean...

36:05.030 --> 36:08.298
Do you need any help picking
out something for Aunt June?

36:08.333 --> 36:11.535
You're working, I'm just gonna
grab a scarf or somethin'.

36:11.570 --> 36:16.540
I'll be in and out of here
in five minutes.

36:16.575 --> 36:18.642
See you tomorrow,
okay, sweetheart?

36:26.585 --> 36:30.320
You should have gone with him.

36:30.355 --> 36:31.688
Well he didn't want my help.

36:31.723 --> 36:32.956
Well, you should have insisted.

36:32.991 --> 36:34.891
I mean, you, you missed a chance
to have a better relationship

36:34.927 --> 36:37.994
with your Father.

36:38.030 --> 36:39.896
By helping him shop?

36:39.932 --> 36:42.566
Well, how many real
conversations have you had

36:42.601 --> 36:44.701
with him since your mother
passed away?

36:44.736 --> 36:50.407
Or, are you both just not
wanting to bother each other?

36:50.442 --> 36:54.010
Our relationship is fine.

36:54.046 --> 36:55.745
Noelle, he's your father.

36:55.781 --> 36:59.716
Things should be better
than just fine.

36:59.751 --> 37:01.751
It's not too late.

37:01.787 --> 37:03.720
You can still catch him.

37:12.431 --> 37:15.131
No. No.

37:15.167 --> 37:17.100
This is just... It's all...

37:17.135 --> 37:19.102
Silly.

37:27.346 --> 37:28.979
There's a crack
in this Halligan.

37:29.014 --> 37:30.447
We need to replace it?

37:30.482 --> 37:31.815
Hello?

37:31.850 --> 37:33.316
Halligan?

37:33.352 --> 37:35.418
Right, yeah, got it.

37:35.454 --> 37:37.254
Where did you go?

37:38.357 --> 37:40.490
Okay, the gala is two weeks away
and so far Noelle

37:40.525 --> 37:42.792
has vetoed every single
suggestion I've made.

37:42.828 --> 37:43.793
Uh-huh.

37:43.829 --> 37:45.829
Like what?

37:45.864 --> 37:47.764
I want it to be more
light-hearted this year.

37:47.799 --> 37:49.833
You know, fun food,
decorations...

37:49.868 --> 37:50.834
Big candy canes.

37:50.869 --> 37:51.668
Giant snowmen.

37:51.703 --> 37:52.636
That sort of thing.

37:52.671 --> 37:54.170
So, why don't we get
the giant candy canes

37:54.206 --> 37:55.472
for the station party?

37:55.507 --> 37:58.174
Don't encourage him.

37:58.210 --> 38:00.176
Are you going to ask her
to our station party,

38:00.212 --> 38:03.013
the night before the gala?

38:03.048 --> 38:03.980
Uh, why would I?

38:04.016 --> 38:06.116
It's... it's for the crew.

38:06.151 --> 38:07.517
But you can bring a date.

38:07.552 --> 38:08.818
Uh-huh.

38:08.854 --> 38:12.022
I'm not interested
in dating her.

38:12.057 --> 38:14.324
Besides, she wouldn't...
she wouldn't come anyway.

38:14.359 --> 38:16.960
Well you never know
until you ask.

38:16.995 --> 38:19.863
I don't think it's a good idea.

38:20.732 --> 38:21.531
What do you want?

38:21.566 --> 38:23.300
A sign?

38:23.335 --> 38:24.634
Yeah.

38:24.670 --> 38:27.370
A sign would be nice.

38:27.406 --> 38:29.639
Come on, get back to work!

38:29.675 --> 38:30.874
<i>Yes sir!</i>

38:32.077 --> 38:33.710
Retail therapy
in our own store?

38:33.745 --> 38:35.979
It's convenient, and besides,

38:36.014 --> 38:39.149
maybe you might find something
inspiring here?

38:39.184 --> 38:40.717
Hint, hint.

38:40.752 --> 38:43.887
Lorna, I am not entering
that photo contest.

38:43.922 --> 38:45.488
I mean, I don't have time.

38:45.524 --> 38:48.224
Not when I'm planning a charity
gala with someone like Jake.

38:48.260 --> 38:52.562
He wants a big snowman
and giant fuzzy reindeer.

38:52.597 --> 38:55.398
He wants what?

38:55.434 --> 38:56.366
Mrs. Fulton.

38:56.401 --> 38:56.900
Alex.

38:56.935 --> 38:58.034
Hello!

38:58.070 --> 39:00.837
Noelle you know Fulton's
doesn't do that sort of event.

39:00.872 --> 39:04.174
Uh, yes, our family has never
been a big fan of,

39:04.209 --> 39:05.542
uh, what do you call it-

39:05.577 --> 39:06.543
I think it sounds fun.

39:06.578 --> 39:08.244
Right. That's it, fun.

39:08.280 --> 39:09.379
Not a fan.

39:09.414 --> 39:13.016
I promise, it will be
an appropriate, tasteful event.

39:13.051 --> 39:14.184
Good.

39:14.219 --> 39:16.586
If you have any problems
with the liaison at the station

39:16.621 --> 39:18.221
just let me know.

39:18.256 --> 39:20.857
All I have to do is make a call
and they'll assign someone else.

39:20.892 --> 39:23.059
I have everything under control.

39:23.095 --> 39:24.427
Good.

39:24.463 --> 39:25.362
Alex.

39:25.397 --> 39:26.396
Yes.

39:27.566 --> 39:28.598
What are you doing?

39:28.633 --> 39:30.200
I'm sorry.

39:30.235 --> 39:33.236
Up here is where we keep all
of our decorations and lighting

39:33.271 --> 39:35.105
and special effects equipment.

39:35.140 --> 39:38.441
If you see something you like,
you just put a sticker on it

39:38.477 --> 39:40.710
and we will hold it for you.

39:40.746 --> 39:43.179
Now, you take your time
and I will be back.

39:45.984 --> 39:47.016
Thank you.

39:51.156 --> 39:54.290
Okay, I want all of this.

39:54.326 --> 39:56.626
Jake, I am so sorry
but Fulton's is-

39:56.661 --> 39:58.294
Traditional and classy.

39:58.330 --> 39:59.929
Is there something wrong
with that?

39:59.965 --> 40:02.399
No, but I think we can have
some fun with it.

40:02.434 --> 40:04.100
Is that the only thing
that's important to you,

40:04.136 --> 40:05.635
just having fun?

40:05.670 --> 40:07.270
No.

40:07.305 --> 40:10.306
You may be okay with not
having fun but I am not.

40:10.342 --> 40:13.143
I have fun!

40:13.178 --> 40:16.279
You are the quietest neighbour
I have ever had.

40:16.314 --> 40:18.748
Do you ever even play music,
sing in the shower,

40:18.784 --> 40:20.483
yell at the TV?

40:20.519 --> 40:22.152
You really need to learn
to live a little.

40:22.187 --> 40:24.120
Oh, just because I don't sing
in the shower

40:24.156 --> 40:27.791
or want inflatable reindeer,
at a tasteful Christmas gala,

40:27.826 --> 40:30.493
doesn't mean I don't live
my life.

40:30.529 --> 40:33.129
When was the last time
you took a risk?

40:33.165 --> 40:34.597
I put on shoes.

40:36.201 --> 40:37.167
Never mind.

40:37.202 --> 40:39.636
Not all of us can run
into burning buildings.

40:39.671 --> 40:41.771
That's not risky.

40:41.807 --> 40:44.974
Okay, it's risky, but we have
training and safety gear.

40:45.010 --> 40:46.843
We never go in without a plan.

40:46.878 --> 40:50.180
Well, then what do
you consider risky?

40:50.215 --> 40:51.614
Well, I'm being considered

40:51.650 --> 40:55.285
for a big promotion
at the fire department.

40:55.320 --> 40:58.188
Taking it would be a risk.

40:58.223 --> 40:59.856
Why?

40:59.891 --> 41:02.325
Because I'd be stepping
on my Father's shadow.

41:02.360 --> 41:05.462
Asking people to take
me seriously.

41:05.497 --> 41:06.596
So, which is it then?

41:06.631 --> 41:10.700
You want to be taken seriously
or you want to have fun?

41:10.735 --> 41:12.435
Can't we have both?

41:14.206 --> 41:15.338
Hey.

41:15.373 --> 41:17.040
I wonder what that does?

41:17.075 --> 41:19.642
Oh, it says "trained
personnel only."

41:19.678 --> 41:22.178
I'm trained.

41:22.214 --> 41:23.046
Oh yeah?

41:23.081 --> 41:26.049
Lots of big red switches
in firefighting?

41:26.084 --> 41:28.017
Come on. You know
you want to do it.

41:28.053 --> 41:30.053
What? No, Jake.

41:30.088 --> 41:31.988
Noelle, live a little.

41:40.432 --> 41:44.734

41:44.769 --> 41:47.170

You really didn't ed

43:01.947 --> 43:02.946
No, it's okay dad.

43:02.981 --> 43:04.614
I wanted to.

43:06.117 --> 43:09.252
Why don't we spend
more time together?

43:09.287 --> 43:11.087
Your mother was always
the talker in the family,

43:11.122 --> 43:12.488
you know that.

43:12.524 --> 43:13.790
When she passed,
I guess,

43:13.825 --> 43:15.458
you and I just haven't
figured out

43:15.493 --> 43:19.162
how fill in all the places
she used to be.

43:19.197 --> 43:21.598
You really think your Aunt June
will like that?

43:21.633 --> 43:24.267
Oh, it's her favourite perfume.

43:24.302 --> 43:26.135
She wears it on special
occasions.

43:26.171 --> 43:27.103
How do you know that?

43:27.138 --> 43:28.972
She lives on the other side
of the country.

43:29.007 --> 43:31.641
Because mom bought it for her
every year.

43:33.011 --> 43:34.077
Yes, your mother was always
much better

43:34.112 --> 43:36.980
at things like Christmas
presents than I ever was.

43:37.015 --> 43:38.348
Oh.

43:38.383 --> 43:40.350
Do you remember that one
year that mom was busy

43:40.385 --> 43:42.018
putting together
the Christmas pageant

43:42.053 --> 43:44.787
and delegated the gift buying
to you?

43:44.823 --> 43:46.823
Now, I still say
that a savings bond

43:46.858 --> 43:48.625
is a very practical present.

43:48.660 --> 43:49.993
Uh, I was seven!

43:58.870 --> 44:00.336
We should do this more often.

44:00.372 --> 44:02.171
Yeah, I agree.

44:04.509 --> 44:06.209
Just give me...
Look up here.

44:07.412 --> 44:08.478
Yeah. There we go.

44:08.513 --> 44:09.812
They are great.

44:09.848 --> 44:11.114
Okay.

44:13.518 --> 44:14.050
Hey.

44:14.085 --> 44:15.385
Hi. I'm Noelle's dad.

44:15.420 --> 44:16.486
Hi there, Will.

44:18.089 --> 44:20.390
Wait, what just happened?

44:20.425 --> 44:21.524
You and your father!

44:21.559 --> 44:23.226
You start opening up
to each other,

44:23.261 --> 44:25.328
talking, sharing...

44:25.363 --> 44:28.865
He encouraged you to go back
into photography and...

44:28.900 --> 44:31.067
But that's not really the point.

44:31.102 --> 44:31.868
It's not?

44:31.903 --> 44:33.503
No.

44:33.538 --> 44:36.873
Your father, and your friends,
you have good relationships.

44:36.908 --> 44:43.012
But you tend to keep everybody
at a distance.

44:43.048 --> 44:43.880
I do not.

44:43.915 --> 44:44.580
Yes you do.

44:44.616 --> 44:45.415
Do not.

44:45.450 --> 44:46.049
Do too.

44:46.084 --> 44:46.549
Do not.

44:46.584 --> 44:47.383
Do...

44:49.788 --> 44:53.389
Noelle, have you
told anyone about

44:53.425 --> 44:56.659
What's-his-face
getting engaged?

44:58.463 --> 45:02.398
Have you told anyone about
how that makes you feel?

45:06.104 --> 45:09.772
You know, that...
that simple act

45:09.808 --> 45:12.442
of having cocoa with your father
on Christmas Eve,

45:12.477 --> 45:15.945
and really connecting
with him again,

45:15.980 --> 45:22.719
opened you up to your family
and your friends.

45:22.754 --> 45:25.288
And love.

45:25.323 --> 45:30.293
This is where you would be today
if you had made that choice.

45:34.432 --> 45:35.732
No! No!

45:37.001 --> 45:38.301
Charlie!

45:38.336 --> 45:40.069

<i>No, nothing's wrong.</i>

46:05.497 --> 46:06.462
<i>I promise.</i>

46:07.532 --> 46:08.664
Um.

46:09.067 --> 46:12.468
I was wondering, do you want
to go have some hot cocoa?

46:15.006 --> 46:17.774
Sure, sweetheart.
I'd love to.

46:18.643 --> 46:19.642
Okay.

46:21.312 --> 46:23.012
I hope you came hungry
because our chef has

46:23.047 --> 46:26.415
some yummy things for you
to taste.

46:28.219 --> 46:30.953
The chef will be out in a minute
so I will leave you to it.

46:30.989 --> 46:31.988
Okay.

46:38.062 --> 46:42.031
So are you bringing anyone
to the gala?

46:42.066 --> 46:44.534
Oh, as a matter of fact I am.

46:44.569 --> 46:46.135
My dad.

46:46.171 --> 46:47.804
We thought we should try
to switch it up

46:47.839 --> 46:49.005
a little this Christmas.

46:49.040 --> 46:51.207
Oh. That's great.

46:51.242 --> 46:54.644
It's probably easier than
bringing your... boyfriend?

46:54.679 --> 46:56.512
Oh, I'm not seeing anyone.

46:56.548 --> 46:57.346
Oh.

46:58.383 --> 46:59.282
And what about you?

46:59.317 --> 47:01.984
Are you, uh, bringing anyone
to the gala?

47:02.020 --> 47:03.719
Nah.

47:03.755 --> 47:06.789
But, uh... maybe.

47:11.930 --> 47:13.896
I wonder what's taking
that chef so long.

47:13.932 --> 47:15.064
Yeah. Should we go find out?

47:15.099 --> 47:16.165
Yeah.

47:19.904 --> 47:22.238
Hi, uh, we're supposed to be
getting a tasting menu

47:23.608 --> 47:24.507

47:24.542 --> 47:26.709
I've got something
very special planned.

47:26.744 --> 47:29.178
Uh, special, really?

47:29.214 --> 47:30.079
Very special.

47:30.114 --> 47:31.914
We're going to make
Christmas cookies!

47:31.950 --> 47:33.082
We are?

47:33.117 --> 47:34.183
Oh yes.

to check?

50:56.421 --> 50:58.354
Oh, I'm sensing a theme.

50:58.389 --> 51:00.056
Yeah, that was a present
from my brother.

51:00.091 --> 51:02.425

ornament.

to be a firefighter?

51:15.807 --> 51:17.373

51:17.408 --> 51:19.041
When I was a kid, I used to come
here and play on the trucks.

51:19.077 --> 51:22.611
I even had my own helmet
with my name on it.

51:22.647 --> 51:24.246

51:30.321 --> 51:34.590
Um... I wanted to be
a photographer.

51:34.625 --> 51:38.594
But, um, I was for a while.

51:38.629 --> 51:41.130
Why did you give it up?

51:41.165 --> 51:43.632
Big dreams are elusive.

51:43.668 --> 51:46.569
And, and your new job,
oh, what was it?

51:46.604 --> 51:49.138
The, uh, Deputy Chief?

51:49.173 --> 51:50.906

51:50.942 --> 51:53.442
It is.

51:53.478 --> 51:55.978
I think it is.

51:56.013 --> 51:59.482

53:08.753 --> 53:10.386
What are you looking at?

53:10.421 --> 53:12.888
Oh, I took some pictures last
night at the fire station

53:12.924 --> 53:15.024
when they were decorating
the tree.

53:15.059 --> 53:16.559
You took pictures?

53:16.594 --> 53:19.195
Does this mean that
you're entering the contest?

53:19.230 --> 53:20.563
I don't think so.

53:20.598 --> 53:23.499
I'll take that as progress.

53:23.534 --> 53:27.002
Is this because of the handsome
firefighter?

53:27.038 --> 53:30.072
Uhhh, not entirely.

53:30.107 --> 53:32.341
Then what?

53:32.376 --> 53:33.475
Okay, I'm gonna
tell you something

53:33.511 --> 53:37.246
but all I ask is that you get me
a great pair of shoes

53:37.281 --> 53:39.348
to go with my straightjacket.

53:40.918 --> 53:43.085
And all this started with shoes?

53:43.120 --> 53:45.354
The irony, huh?

53:45.389 --> 53:47.856
Well it's quite a story.

53:47.892 --> 53:51.060
You think she's, what,
your guardian angel?

53:51.095 --> 53:53.229
Do you believe me?

53:53.264 --> 53:55.397
I've known you a long time,
you are the most

53:55.433 --> 53:57.099
reasonable, down to earth person
I've ever met.

53:57.134 --> 53:58.567
You make me sound boring.

53:58.603 --> 53:59.501
Well...

53:59.537 --> 54:00.436
Hey!

54:00.471 --> 54:03.038
No, look, in this case
it's a good thing.

54:03.074 --> 54:03.939
You're not the kind of person

54:03.975 --> 54:05.674
that would make up something
like this.

54:05.710 --> 54:07.343
Well, thank you.

54:07.378 --> 54:10.412
The question now is what am I
going to do about it.

54:10.448 --> 54:14.583
Well, if it were me,
I'd demand answers.

54:14.619 --> 54:16.185
Why is she here?

54:16.220 --> 54:18.754
Is Jake the mystery husband
walking into the apartment?

54:18.789 --> 54:21.590
And what about the other guy
at the photoshoot... Will?

54:21.626 --> 54:23.058
What if she doesn't tell me?

54:23.094 --> 54:25.728
Then you know what you have
to do.

54:42.113 --> 54:43.545
Hey, you didn't jump!

54:43.581 --> 54:45.581
You're getting used to me.

54:45.616 --> 54:47.583
Actually, I'm glad to see you.

54:47.618 --> 54:48.584
We need to talk.

54:48.619 --> 54:49.518
Of course, of course.

54:49.553 --> 54:55.124
But first, another trip
down memory lane.

54:55.159 --> 54:56.191
No.

54:56.227 --> 54:57.693
Not until I get some answers.

54:57.728 --> 54:59.962
Oh Noelle. What happened
to having faith?

54:59.997 --> 55:00.796
Believing!

55:00.831 --> 55:02.031
No, I, I believe.

55:02.066 --> 55:03.699
I mean, I think I do.

55:03.734 --> 55:04.533
I just...

55:04.568 --> 55:05.868
That's not the point.

55:05.903 --> 55:09.505
I just, before taking any more
leaps of faith

55:09.540 --> 55:11.340
I need to make sure the ground
is going to be there

55:11.375 --> 55:12.508
when I land.

55:12.543 --> 55:14.176
But that's not a leap of faith.

55:14.211 --> 55:16.145
Now, is it? At all?

55:16.180 --> 55:18.547
I... I mean, I know
I'm new to all this but,

55:18.582 --> 55:20.983
I mean, I think things have
been going pretty well?

55:21.018 --> 55:22.518
So far. Huh?

55:22.553 --> 55:23.719
Don't you?

55:23.754 --> 55:25.654
Well. I don't know
how it's going.

55:25.690 --> 55:27.056
I just think that
it's time that I--

55:27.091 --> 55:27.990
Noelle!

55:28.025 --> 55:29.892
We were looking for you.

55:29.927 --> 55:31.694
Who are you talking to?

55:31.729 --> 55:34.730
Oh, um, I was...
Mrs. Fulton!

55:34.765 --> 55:36.899
That is a beautiful necklace
you have on.

55:36.934 --> 55:38.567
Oh, thank you.

55:38.602 --> 55:41.503
I just spoke with Evelyn Moore
at the hotel.

55:41.539 --> 55:44.206
She mentioned something
about using a snow machine

55:44.241 --> 55:46.342
for the gala?

55:46.377 --> 55:48.377
Oh, well, that was just
an option.

55:48.412 --> 55:49.178
Jake was--

55:49.213 --> 55:52.581
Jake? As I suspected.

55:52.616 --> 55:53.515
This is the same man

55:53.551 --> 55:56.385
who wanted the snowmen
and reindeer, yes?

55:56.420 --> 55:58.420
Yes, but we aren't doing that.

55:58.456 --> 56:01.023
Still, it's obvious he doesn't
share our vision

56:01.058 --> 56:03.425
of what a gala should be.

56:03.461 --> 56:05.694
Yes, but it is
for the fire station.

56:05.730 --> 56:08.731
But we're paying for it and
it must fit with our brand.

56:08.766 --> 56:09.565
Right Alex?

56:09.600 --> 56:11.433
Right. Yes.

56:11.469 --> 56:15.104
Uh, we think it's time we made
some changes.

56:15.139 --> 56:16.438
Oh.

56:16.474 --> 56:18.073
Are you taking me off
the project?

56:18.109 --> 56:19.108
No.

56:19.143 --> 56:21.877
We're taking this Jake person
off the project.

56:21.912 --> 56:23.112
Oh, please don't do that.

56:23.147 --> 56:24.947
The decision has been made,
Noelle.

56:24.982 --> 56:26.048
No, wait.

56:26.083 --> 56:28.717
Uh... Let me tell him.

56:28.753 --> 56:30.285
I'll ask him to step aside.

56:30.321 --> 56:33.355
It... It'll be better
for everyone that way.

56:34.792 --> 56:35.758
Fine.

56:37.661 --> 56:39.094
I'm sorry.

56:44.335 --> 56:47.403
Still think things are going
pretty well?

56:58.883 --> 56:59.415
Yup.

56:59.450 --> 57:00.349
He's right over there.

57:00.384 --> 57:01.850
Thanks.

57:02.586 --> 57:03.719
Hey.

57:03.754 --> 57:05.521
What are you doing here?

57:05.556 --> 57:07.556
I brought you some cookies.

57:07.591 --> 57:09.191
Really?

57:09.226 --> 57:09.892
Thank you.

57:09.927 --> 57:11.994
That's... that's really nice.

57:12.029 --> 57:14.563
And I wanted to talk to you.

57:14.598 --> 57:16.064
About what?

57:16.100 --> 57:17.499
The gala.

57:17.535 --> 57:19.234
Good, I actually wanted to talk
to you too,

57:19.270 --> 57:22.671
I... I just wanted to say
thank you.

57:22.706 --> 57:23.772
For what?

57:23.808 --> 57:25.707
Well, working on this has been
a big responsibility

57:25.743 --> 57:28.076
but you've... you've let me put
my own mark on it

57:28.112 --> 57:30.212
and I feel if I could do that
with this,

57:30.247 --> 57:32.881
I could do that
with my new job.

57:32.917 --> 57:35.184
What I'm really
trying to say is,

57:35.219 --> 57:39.755
I'm having a really good time
working with you.

57:39.790 --> 57:41.223
Me too.

57:41.258 --> 57:42.558
Good.

57:42.593 --> 57:43.358
I... I'm sorry.

57:43.394 --> 57:45.327
What was it that
you wanted to say?

57:47.465 --> 57:49.431
Enjoy the cookies!

57:49.467 --> 57:50.766
Thank you.

57:50.801 --> 57:52.100
I'll see ya later.

57:52.136 --> 57:53.202
Yeah.

57:58.809 --> 58:01.276
Oh! These cookies are delicious!

58:01.312 --> 58:02.277
What?

58:02.313 --> 58:03.879
Those were supposed to be
to soften the blow

58:03.914 --> 58:07.282
for when I told Jake that he
couldn't work on the gala but--

58:07.318 --> 58:10.786
Oh, Noelle, I, I'm sorry,
I'll just put it...

58:10.821 --> 58:13.622
Look I, I know...

58:13.657 --> 58:16.124
I know that things have kind of
hit a snag with you and Jake

58:16.160 --> 58:17.459
but it's all going
to be all right.

58:17.495 --> 58:18.760
You know, you just
have to--

58:18.796 --> 58:20.963
Have faith. I know,
I know.

58:20.998 --> 58:24.266
But I need some answers first.

58:27.771 --> 58:29.004
Okay.

58:29.039 --> 58:32.975
So, does everyone have someone
like you, watching over them?

58:33.010 --> 58:34.243
Oh yes.

58:34.278 --> 58:35.377
They're always there,

58:35.412 --> 58:37.980
working in the background
in ways you don't notice.

58:38.015 --> 58:41.316
You know, we're sort of like
Santa's elves, you know.

58:41.352 --> 58:44.486
Well... only, you know, taller.

58:44.522 --> 58:48.490
But not everyone's shows up in
the shoe department at Fulton's.

58:48.526 --> 58:49.958
Oh, no, no.

58:49.994 --> 58:52.494
That's for very special cases.

58:52.530 --> 58:54.129
I'm a special case?

58:54.164 --> 58:55.430
Very.

58:55.466 --> 58:57.099
Why?

58:57.134 --> 58:59.635
Well, you know, don't quote me,

58:59.670 --> 59:00.702
remember I'm just a rookie
at all this,

59:00.738 --> 59:04.806
but, in some instances there
are people who stray

59:04.842 --> 59:08.010
off the paths they're supposed
to be on.

59:08.045 --> 59:10.445
So, it's like fate?

59:10.481 --> 59:11.179
Oh no.

59:11.215 --> 59:12.281
No, no, no, no.

59:12.316 --> 59:13.515
We still have choices,
you know.

59:13.551 --> 59:17.686
And as you've seen, there are
different possible outcomes.

59:17.721 --> 59:21.456
In fact, I probably shouldn't
tell you this.

59:21.492 --> 59:24.192
There is a certain combination
of decisions

59:24.228 --> 59:27.195
that would have made you
the owner of a very successful

59:27.231 --> 59:30.699
chain of hot dog stands.

59:30.734 --> 59:35.370
I... really?

59:35.406 --> 59:37.105
Yeah.

59:37.141 --> 59:41.043
I mean for people to get everything
that they really need in life,

59:41.078 --> 59:42.878
there's certain paths
that we need to

59:42.913 --> 59:45.047
nudge them back onto sometimes.

59:45.082 --> 59:46.548
And... and sometimes
it's... it's...

59:46.584 --> 59:47.716
it's more than just a nudge.

59:47.751 --> 59:49.351
Sometimes it's more like a...

59:49.386 --> 59:53.055
you know, like a...
like a shove.

59:53.090 --> 59:55.390
You know?

59:55.426 --> 59:57.859
And, uh, you know, especially
people who are starting

59:57.895 --> 01:00:04.533
to doubt that their prayers
are worth being heard.

01:00:04.568 --> 01:00:08.236
I'm that far off my path?

01:00:08.272 --> 01:00:11.173
Well, I mean you're not
"hot dog stand" off,

01:00:11.208 --> 01:00:13.742
but pretty far off.

01:00:13.777 --> 01:00:15.577
And it's starting to have
a greater effect

01:00:15.613 --> 01:00:16.511
than you could poss-

01:00:16.547 --> 01:00:17.346
On what?

01:00:18.749 --> 01:00:22.718
Noelle, what we do or don't do
in life

01:00:22.753 --> 01:00:24.353
makes a difference
in the world around us.

01:00:24.388 --> 01:00:26.221
We have to decide
what difference it is

01:00:26.256 --> 01:00:29.057
we want to make in the world.

01:00:36.734 --> 01:00:40.602
Okay, I mean, I know
that you're new to this,

01:00:40.638 --> 01:00:45.607
but, I mean did I have someone
like you before?

01:00:45.643 --> 01:00:46.408
Yes.

01:00:46.443 --> 01:00:47.442
Yes, you did.

01:00:47.478 --> 01:00:50.278
They... they send us where
we are more needed.

01:00:50.314 --> 01:00:52.581
And... and they tried
to nudge me?

01:00:52.616 --> 01:00:54.583
Oh, many times.

01:00:54.618 --> 01:00:56.284
Well they shoulda
nudged harder.

01:00:58.455 --> 01:01:00.622
Oh, that reminds me
of a story.

01:01:00.658 --> 01:01:02.958
There was a great Christmas Eve
blizzard

01:01:02.993 --> 01:01:05.060
and a man was trapped
in the rising snow

01:01:05.095 --> 01:01:08.130
and he prayed to God
to save him.

01:01:08.165 --> 01:01:10.632
So along came a sleigh
driven by a jolly fellow

01:01:10.668 --> 01:01:13.235
who offered the man
a ride to safety.

01:01:13.270 --> 01:01:15.771
But the man declined,
saying that he had faith

01:01:15.806 --> 01:01:17.739
that God would save him.

01:01:17.775 --> 01:01:19.808
Then a while later the driver
of the sleigh came back

01:01:19.843 --> 01:01:22.944
offered the man again
but the man refused.

01:01:22.980 --> 01:01:25.280
Sleigh came back a third time.

01:01:25.315 --> 01:01:29.951
Now, the man was trapped
in the snow up to his chin.

01:01:29.987 --> 01:01:31.486
But he still refused
to get on board,

01:01:31.522 --> 01:01:34.923
insisting that God
would save him.

01:01:34.958 --> 01:01:37.659
And do you know
what happened?

01:01:37.695 --> 01:01:39.428
God saved him?

01:01:39.463 --> 01:01:40.495
Oh, no, no.

01:01:40.531 --> 01:01:42.330
Sadly, he, he passed.

01:01:43.701 --> 01:01:45.434
Okay, that is
a terrible story.

01:01:45.469 --> 01:01:46.401
Oh, I'm not done yet.

01:01:46.437 --> 01:01:50.105
So, the man is welcomed
into Heaven by God.

01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:51.673
And he says to God,

01:01:51.709 --> 01:01:56.678
"God, I... I had faith in you.

01:01:56.714 --> 01:01:59.314
"Why didn't you save me?"

01:01:59.349 --> 01:02:02.184
And God said "What are you
talking about?

01:02:02.219 --> 01:02:04.186
"I sent the sleigh three times!"

01:02:06.056 --> 01:02:10.959
See, the point is, Noelle,
the sleighs have been coming.

01:02:10.994 --> 01:02:14.996
But you just have not been
willing to climb aboard.

01:02:26.343 --> 01:02:27.642
Where are we going this time?

01:02:27.678 --> 01:02:28.877
Christmas Eve.

01:02:28.912 --> 01:02:30.812
One year ago.

01:02:33.083 --> 01:02:35.150
Oh, I remember these.

01:02:38.422 --> 01:02:39.721
I wore them to the-

01:02:39.757 --> 01:02:42.491
- to the Christmas party
I had.

01:02:42.526 --> 01:02:45.527
Do you remember
what happened next?

01:02:45.562 --> 01:02:46.061
I don't.

01:02:46.096 --> 01:02:48.864
I, I, I'm not sure.

01:02:48.899 --> 01:02:50.465
Noelle?

01:02:50.501 --> 01:02:52.534
I know you like to wait 'til
Christmas morning to open gifts,

01:02:52.569 --> 01:02:55.670
but open this one now.

01:02:55.706 --> 01:02:58.373
Okay. Thank you.

01:03:05.883 --> 01:03:09.017
The guy at the camera shop
said it's the best one.

01:03:09.052 --> 01:03:10.085
Lorna.

01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:12.721
I know, I know, you don't take
pictures anymore,

01:03:12.756 --> 01:03:15.423
but there's this
annual competition.

01:03:15.459 --> 01:03:17.526
The most inspiring photo
of the year.

01:03:17.561 --> 01:03:19.661
You need to enter it.

01:03:23.734 --> 01:03:24.599
Do you remember what you did

01:03:24.635 --> 01:03:27.736
with the lens after
everyone had gone?

01:03:33.277 --> 01:03:36.711
Let me guess, the lens
was a sleigh?

01:03:36.747 --> 01:03:38.747
That is one way of putting it.

01:03:38.782 --> 01:03:39.981
Okay, I get it.

01:03:40.017 --> 01:03:42.284
I passed up the chance to be
a photographer multiple times

01:03:42.319 --> 01:03:45.387
but we already went over
the career stuff.

01:03:45.422 --> 01:03:46.388
This isn't about your career.

01:03:46.423 --> 01:03:47.789
This is about love.

01:03:47.825 --> 01:03:48.957
Love?

01:03:48.992 --> 01:03:50.592
Just say yes.

01:04:00.671 --> 01:04:03.905
Alright. Just give me...
look up here.

01:04:03.941 --> 01:04:07.142
All right. Okay, last one!

01:04:07.177 --> 01:04:07.843
Yeah.

01:04:07.878 --> 01:04:09.311
There we go.
Those are great.

01:04:09.346 --> 01:04:10.212
Okay.

01:04:13.183 --> 01:04:13.715
Hey.

01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:15.150
Hi. I'm Noelle's dad.

01:04:15.185 --> 01:04:16.318
Hey there. Will.

01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:19.254
You know your daughter is,
uh, quite the photographer.

01:04:19.289 --> 01:04:20.488
Yes, she is.

01:04:20.524 --> 01:04:23.091
I have to admit, I am not used
to getting my picture taken.

01:04:23.126 --> 01:04:24.192
Especially not with
the Santa cap on.

01:04:24.228 --> 01:04:26.828
But Noelle here, she's
making it pretty easy on me.

01:04:26.864 --> 01:04:29.097
Well that's why everybody
likes to work with her.

01:04:29.132 --> 01:04:32.634
Although, I think sometimes
she works a little too much.

01:04:32.669 --> 01:04:36.271
She needs to save time
for some kind of fun.

01:04:36.306 --> 01:04:38.473
Maybe go on a date.

01:04:38.508 --> 01:04:39.441
Dad!

01:04:42.813 --> 01:04:44.145
I am so sorry!

01:04:44.181 --> 01:04:45.213
No, no don't be.

01:04:45.249 --> 01:04:47.682
My, uh, my dad used to try
and set me up on dates

01:04:47.718 --> 01:04:48.783
all the time too.

01:04:48.819 --> 01:04:49.818
Oh.

01:04:49.853 --> 01:04:51.186
So is he correct?

01:04:51.221 --> 01:04:53.355
Do you really not have time
to date?

01:04:53.390 --> 01:04:56.191
Oh, no, I... I do have time.

01:04:56.226 --> 01:05:00.362
I, I just uh, haven't been asked
out by the right guy, I guess.

01:05:00.397 --> 01:05:01.496
Ah.

01:05:01.531 --> 01:05:03.698
But if the right guy did
come along and ask you out,

01:05:03.734 --> 01:05:06.368
what would you say?

01:05:06.403 --> 01:05:08.270
I'd say, yes.

01:05:21.218 --> 01:05:23.685
Hey, honey! I'm home.

01:05:31.895 --> 01:05:33.728
Wait. Will?

01:05:33.764 --> 01:05:35.864
I'm... I'm married to Will?

01:05:35.899 --> 01:05:36.865
I...

01:05:36.900 --> 01:05:38.233
Why, why, why isn't it Jake?

01:05:38.268 --> 01:05:40.568
I mean why are you pushing me
towards Jake

01:05:40.604 --> 01:05:44.072
if he's not the one I'm supposed
to end up with?

01:05:44.107 --> 01:05:47.909
What I am pushing you toward
is taking chances.

01:05:47.945 --> 01:05:50.011
Embracing joy.

01:05:50.047 --> 01:05:52.414
Opening up to love.

01:05:52.449 --> 01:05:56.184
If you were willing to take that
leap of faith with your heart,

01:05:56.219 --> 01:05:58.920
then the details
aren't important.

01:05:58.956 --> 01:06:01.856
Your true love is out there.

01:06:01.892 --> 01:06:04.659
And he's waiting for you.

01:06:09.132 --> 01:06:11.566
But it's not Jake.

01:06:19.343 --> 01:06:20.842
<i>I didn't think that people
still borrowed sugar</i>

01:06:20.877 --> 01:06:21.876
<i>from their neighbours.</i>

01:06:21.912 --> 01:06:24.179
Yeah, well your Christmas
cookies inspired me

01:06:24.214 --> 01:06:27.182
so I'm making some
for the station.

01:06:27.217 --> 01:06:30.085
Your place is, it's great.

01:06:31.688 --> 01:06:34.456
Hey, are these the pictures
you've been taking?

01:06:34.491 --> 01:06:35.857
Yeah.

01:06:35.892 --> 01:06:37.359
May I have a look?

01:06:37.394 --> 01:06:40.161
Um, of course, yes.

01:06:44.568 --> 01:06:47.035
These are... these are
incredible.

01:06:47.070 --> 01:06:48.203
Oh, thank you.

01:06:48.238 --> 01:06:49.637
I'm a little bit rusty.

01:06:49.673 --> 01:06:51.206
Well, if this is you rusty
I can't wait to see

01:06:51.241 --> 01:06:54.275
what you're like when you're
running at full speed.

01:06:56.847 --> 01:07:00.515
Those are back when I was
doing it professionally.

01:07:00.550 --> 01:07:02.550
Wow.

01:07:02.586 --> 01:07:05.053
You are really talented.

01:07:05.088 --> 01:07:07.689
Thank you.

01:07:07.724 --> 01:07:09.858
I especially like that one.

01:07:09.893 --> 01:07:12.060
You should enter that
in the photo contest.

01:07:12.095 --> 01:07:15.330
Oh, yeah, I... I would
but I, um,

01:07:15.365 --> 01:07:16.731
I didn't even get her name.

01:07:16.767 --> 01:07:19.000
It was a spur of the moment
picture.

01:07:19.036 --> 01:07:22.570
Well you have lots of other
really good candidates here.

01:07:22.606 --> 01:07:24.339
You can submit more than one,
right?

01:07:24.374 --> 01:07:26.007
Yeah, I think so.

01:07:26.043 --> 01:07:28.343
I think you should do it.

01:07:28.378 --> 01:07:29.611
Hey, would you mind, uh,

01:07:29.646 --> 01:07:33.581
making some prints of the photos
you took at the fire station?

01:07:33.617 --> 01:07:34.682
Oh, sure.

01:07:34.718 --> 01:07:35.617
Yeah, I'll do it
tomorrow morning

01:07:35.652 --> 01:07:37.752
and then give them to you
at the party.

01:07:37.788 --> 01:07:39.387
So you're still planning
on coming?

01:07:39.423 --> 01:07:40.588
Of course.

01:07:40.624 --> 01:07:42.724
I have to work
but I will be there.

01:07:42.759 --> 01:07:43.625
Great.

01:07:43.660 --> 01:07:46.528
Well, I will, uh,
I'll see you there.

01:07:46.563 --> 01:07:47.195
Okay.

01:07:47.230 --> 01:07:49.364
Oh, don't forget your sugar.

01:07:49.399 --> 01:07:50.265
Oh.

01:07:50.300 --> 01:07:51.099
Sugar.

01:07:51.768 --> 01:07:52.734
Thank you.

01:07:52.769 --> 01:07:53.134
Sure.

01:07:53.170 --> 01:07:54.069
Good night.

01:07:54.104 --> 01:07:55.904
Night.

01:08:01.578 --> 01:08:03.378
These are amazing.

01:08:03.413 --> 01:08:05.113
You're gonna win the contest.

01:08:05.148 --> 01:08:07.615
And Jake is gonna love these.

01:08:07.651 --> 01:08:09.384
I hope so.

01:08:09.419 --> 01:08:11.786
Even if he isn't the guy
I'm supposed to end up with.

01:08:11.822 --> 01:08:13.788
You never know until you try.

01:08:13.824 --> 01:08:15.924
And if he isn't, maybe
the "honey, I'm home" guy

01:08:15.959 --> 01:08:17.292
will be at the party.

01:08:17.327 --> 01:08:18.725
Maybe that's why Charlie
encouraged you

01:08:18.761 --> 01:08:20.962
to get close to Jake.

01:08:20.997 --> 01:08:22.029
Maybe.

01:08:25.301 --> 01:08:29.604
Oh, that's my dad.

01:08:29.639 --> 01:08:31.805
Hey dad, what's wrong?

01:08:31.841 --> 01:08:33.308
I get why that bothers
you now.

01:08:33.343 --> 01:08:34.274
Good.

01:08:34.310 --> 01:08:36.478
<i>But actually there is
something wrong.</i>

01:08:36.513 --> 01:08:38.979
Your Aunt June slipped on
some ice and broke her leg.

01:08:39.015 --> 01:08:40.482
I might have to fly
out there.

01:08:40.517 --> 01:08:42.149
Oh no. When?

01:08:42.185 --> 01:08:43.151
Tomorrow.

01:08:43.185 --> 01:08:44.752
You're gonna miss the gala.

01:08:44.787 --> 01:08:46.287
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

01:08:46.323 --> 01:08:49.323
Yeah, I was just really looking
forward to going with you.

01:08:49.359 --> 01:08:52.961
<i>I know but your Aunt June
doesn't have any other family.</i>

01:09:01.037 --> 01:09:03.638
Dad, I have to go.
I love you.

01:09:03.673 --> 01:09:05.473
<i>I love you too, sweetheart.</i>

01:09:09.479 --> 01:09:10.178
Hey!

01:09:10.212 --> 01:09:11.412
Hey.

01:09:11.448 --> 01:09:12.514
I was in the neighbourhood,
thought I'd pick up the prints.

01:09:12.549 --> 01:09:13.348
Yeah, here...
here they are.

01:09:13.383 --> 01:09:13.915
Oh, good.

01:09:13.950 --> 01:09:14.616
Uh, I'll see ya tonight?

01:09:14.651 --> 01:09:16.818
Uh. Noelle, hold up a minute.

01:09:16.853 --> 01:09:17.785
Hi, sorry to interrupt.

01:09:17.821 --> 01:09:18.786
We just want to add some people

01:09:18.822 --> 01:09:20.854
to the guest list for the gala
tomorrow night.

01:09:20.890 --> 01:09:22.189
Oh, great, the more the merrier.

01:09:22.225 --> 01:09:23.191
Hello.

01:09:23.225 --> 01:09:24.359
Helen Fulton.

01:09:24.394 --> 01:09:25.026
Alex.

01:09:25.060 --> 01:09:25.960
Fulton.

01:09:25.996 --> 01:09:27.529
Ah, you're the family that owns
the store.

01:09:27.564 --> 01:09:28.029
Pleasure to meet you.

01:09:28.064 --> 01:09:28.662
I'm Jake Marsden.

01:09:28.698 --> 01:09:29.997
I'm with the fire station.

01:09:30.033 --> 01:09:31.866
Thank you for everything
you've done for us.

01:09:31.902 --> 01:09:33.033
Oh.

01:09:33.069 --> 01:09:34.202
Yes.

01:09:34.604 --> 01:09:37.205
I hope you understand about
the change we had to make.

01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:39.807
Don't you have to get things
ready for tonight's party?

01:09:39.843 --> 01:09:40.841
It was nothing personal.

01:09:40.877 --> 01:09:42.710
I just felt it was better
to have someone else

01:09:42.746 --> 01:09:45.046
working on the gala
with Noelle.

01:09:45.081 --> 01:09:46.346
I... I don't... I don't
understand.

01:09:46.383 --> 01:09:48.483
Mrs. Fulton I will follow up
with the names

01:09:48.518 --> 01:09:49.716
on that guest list.

01:09:49.752 --> 01:09:50.551
Thank you.

01:09:50.587 --> 01:09:52.520
It was nice meeting you.

01:09:59.196 --> 01:10:01.496
What is she talking about?

01:10:01.531 --> 01:10:04.866
She heard about the things you
wanted to do at the gala and...

01:10:04.901 --> 01:10:06.901
She didn't want you working
on it

01:10:06.937 --> 01:10:10.004
and I was supposed to tell you.

01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:12.740
Okay, so everything I thought
I was adding to the gala,

01:10:12.776 --> 01:10:14.409
the snow machine,
the coloured lights,

01:10:14.444 --> 01:10:17.078
everything we talked about,
we're not doing any of it?

01:10:17.113 --> 01:10:18.413
Jake, I am sorry,

01:10:18.448 --> 01:10:20.415
but Mrs. Fulton
is very particular.

01:10:20.450 --> 01:10:22.584
Which is fine, I mean they're
paying for it,

01:10:22.619 --> 01:10:25.253
it should be what they want.

01:10:25.288 --> 01:10:28.923
I don't understand why you
didn't tell me.

01:10:28.959 --> 01:10:31.259
Well, I... I didn't want you
to feel like-

01:10:31.294 --> 01:10:33.528
Like I wasn't being
taken seriously?

01:10:36.066 --> 01:10:37.265
Uh.

01:10:37.300 --> 01:10:39.601
Jake, I...

01:10:49.613 --> 01:10:50.878
Aren't you getting ready
for the party

01:10:50.914 --> 01:10:53.114
at the fire station tonight?

01:10:53.149 --> 01:10:54.582
Party?

01:10:54.618 --> 01:10:56.217
I thought you were
watching everything.

01:10:56.253 --> 01:10:58.620
Didn't you see what just
happened with Jake?

01:10:58.655 --> 01:10:59.487
Jake will be fine.

01:10:59.522 --> 01:11:00.722
No, but you have to go
to the party.

01:11:00.757 --> 01:11:01.656
It's very important.

01:11:01.691 --> 01:11:03.891
I don't even know
if he wants me there.

01:11:03.927 --> 01:11:06.060
And even if he did, I don't
think I could face him.

01:11:06.096 --> 01:11:07.028
Trust me.

01:11:07.063 --> 01:11:09.130
Things have a way of working
themselves out.

01:11:09.165 --> 01:11:10.632
Do they?

01:11:10.667 --> 01:11:13.301
Because I finally started
believing...

01:11:13.336 --> 01:11:16.604
in Jake, and my photography
and my dad.

01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:17.772
Honey, that's wonderful.

01:11:17.807 --> 01:11:19.274
And for what?

01:11:19.309 --> 01:11:21.442
Jake may not even be
the one for me.

01:11:21.478 --> 01:11:24.646
I can't go to that party
and the gala was almost ruined

01:11:24.681 --> 01:11:28.283
and my dad might even
miss Christmas with me.

01:11:28.318 --> 01:11:29.484
I just thought that this
was going to be

01:11:29.519 --> 01:11:31.819
such a good holiday this year.

01:11:31.855 --> 01:11:32.487
It can.

01:11:32.522 --> 01:11:34.455
You just have to have faith.

01:11:34.491 --> 01:11:35.290
Ooooh!

01:11:35.325 --> 01:11:38.092
I wish you would stop
saying that!

01:11:38.128 --> 01:11:40.595
Look, Charlie, I am having
a hard time believing

01:11:40.630 --> 01:11:43.164
that anyone is sending
any sleighs for me.

01:11:43.199 --> 01:11:44.499
I am here for you.

01:11:44.534 --> 01:11:46.301
Well then do something.

01:11:46.336 --> 01:11:47.602
Please.

01:11:47.637 --> 01:11:50.438
Just work your magic
or your miracles.

01:11:50.473 --> 01:11:53.641
Noelle, taking leaps of faith
means accepting

01:11:53.677 --> 01:11:56.110
that you don't always land
exactly where you want to,

01:11:56.146 --> 01:11:59.013
but believing that you are still
better than where you were.

01:11:59.049 --> 01:12:01.949
But I was fine before
you showed up.

01:12:01.985 --> 01:12:03.685
You know, it might not have
been the dream job,

01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:07.188
and perfect life,
but I was content.

01:12:07.223 --> 01:12:09.023
I was comfortable.

01:12:09.059 --> 01:12:13.361
Well, Noelle, maybe God doesn't
want us to just be comfortable.

01:12:13.396 --> 01:12:16.497
Maybe we shouldn't just settle
for being content.

01:12:16.533 --> 01:12:20.034
Nothing worth having
comes without risk.

01:12:20.070 --> 01:12:25.206
Yeah, but every time I risk,
I just wind up disappointed.

01:12:25.241 --> 01:12:29.344
And I am so tired
of being disappointed.

01:12:29.379 --> 01:12:30.878
I just wish you never even...

01:12:36.753 --> 01:12:39.020
I didn't mean... I'm so--

01:12:39.055 --> 01:12:41.989
Oh. I'm sorry. Charlie!

01:12:42.025 --> 01:12:43.491
Charlie?

01:12:43.526 --> 01:12:44.959
Charlie?

01:13:18.094 --> 01:13:21.729
siizing to, well,
thin air I guess.

01:13:21.765 --> 01:13:24.065
I don't know if
she heard me.

01:13:24.100 --> 01:13:25.900
I'm sure she did.

01:13:25.935 --> 01:13:27.735
And what about Jake?

01:13:27.771 --> 01:13:31.038
I called him, got his voicemail,
I didn't know what to say.

01:13:31.074 --> 01:13:33.541
Well, look at the bright side.

01:13:33.576 --> 01:13:37.745
The gala is in a few hours
and that is going to be great.

01:13:37.781 --> 01:13:39.847
Oh, maybe I shouldn't go.

01:13:39.883 --> 01:13:41.082
You have to go.

01:13:41.117 --> 01:13:43.418
You're the one who put it
all together.

01:13:43.453 --> 01:13:45.686
I don't know.

01:13:45.722 --> 01:13:47.522
I'll think about it.

01:13:47.557 --> 01:13:48.523
You know, I'm gonna take
one last shot

01:13:48.558 --> 01:13:51.559
looking for that personnel
file Alex wanted.

01:13:51.594 --> 01:13:53.494
I'll call ya later.

01:14:02.105 --> 01:14:03.538
Yes!

01:14:03.573 --> 01:14:05.573
Finally.

01:14:07.811 --> 01:14:08.576
Oh!

01:14:08.611 --> 01:14:09.210
Alex.

01:14:09.245 --> 01:14:10.545
I finally found that file.

01:14:10.580 --> 01:14:11.779
Charlene Pennymar.

01:14:11.815 --> 01:14:14.115
Oh, wonderful, thank you.

01:14:14.150 --> 01:14:16.284
This will be such a nice
addition to my mother's gift.

01:14:16.319 --> 01:14:17.752
Oh, I'm sure she'll love it.

01:14:17.787 --> 01:14:20.121
I usually get her jewelry,
or a sweater,

01:14:20.156 --> 01:14:23.257
but, uh, this might be a little
outside of her comfort zone.

01:14:23.293 --> 01:14:25.226
Sometimes that's a good thing.

01:14:25.261 --> 01:14:26.727
Yes, it is.

01:14:26.763 --> 01:14:28.563
Oh good, there's even a picture.

01:14:28.598 --> 01:14:30.231
Oh, may I see it?

01:14:30.266 --> 01:14:31.599
Sure.

01:14:33.670 --> 01:14:36.137
She's the woman
from the photo I took.

01:14:36.172 --> 01:14:38.239
Charlie DID send me
another sleigh...

01:14:39.175 --> 01:14:41.309
Hello, Charlene Pennymar.

01:14:41.344 --> 01:14:42.376
Hmph.

01:14:43.947 --> 01:14:47.582
Well, I better go pick up my mom
and get to the gala.

01:14:47.617 --> 01:14:48.983
Are you sure you don't want
to join us?

01:14:49.018 --> 01:14:50.618
Really, it's no trouble.

01:14:50.653 --> 01:14:53.287
We even have a dress for you.

01:14:55.692 --> 01:14:59.260
Oh, it's perfect.

01:14:59.295 --> 01:15:02.330
Thank you.

01:15:02.365 --> 01:15:04.665
You know, it's just missing
one little thing.

01:15:14.878 --> 01:15:16.777
This place looks great.

01:15:16.813 --> 01:15:20.181
Oh, yeah, it, uh, turned out.

01:15:20.216 --> 01:15:21.148
Aw.

01:15:21.184 --> 01:15:23.684
You still bummed about
this thing with Noelle?

01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:25.319
I am.

01:15:25.355 --> 01:15:27.455
Oh, um, I forgot to tell you.

01:15:27.490 --> 01:15:30.458
They officially offered me
the Deputy Chief job.

01:15:30.493 --> 01:15:32.693
That's great news, Jake!

01:15:32.729 --> 01:15:33.995
I'm really happy for you.

01:15:34.030 --> 01:15:35.296
Thank you.

01:15:35.331 --> 01:15:36.964
Are you happy for you?

01:15:38.234 --> 01:15:41.335
I'm not sure if I'm really ready
to sit behind a desk.

01:15:41.371 --> 01:15:42.970
I love being a firefighter.

01:15:43.006 --> 01:15:45.640
The excitement, the camaraderie,
the family.

01:15:47.243 --> 01:15:50.044
Being part of my dad's legacy.

01:15:50.079 --> 01:15:52.213
I'm gonna miss that.

01:15:52.248 --> 01:15:56.884
Then maybe this new job
isn't what you really want.

01:15:56.920 --> 01:16:00.054
Well, it's Christmas,
maybe I should ask Santa

01:16:00.089 --> 01:16:01.556
for what I really need.

01:16:01.591 --> 01:16:03.824
And maybe you'll get that sign
you've been looking for.

01:16:03.860 --> 01:16:05.226
Yeah.

01:16:05.261 --> 01:16:06.193
I'll keep my eyes open.

01:16:06.229 --> 01:16:07.028
Yeah.

01:16:07.063 --> 01:16:07.862
Shall we dance?

01:16:07.897 --> 01:16:08.863
Yes!

01:16:57.914 --> 01:16:59.780
You came! You look stunning!

01:16:59.816 --> 01:17:00.881
And the dress!

01:17:00.917 --> 01:17:03.084
Oh, it was a gift from Alex.

01:17:04.921 --> 01:17:06.921
I'll see you in a bit.

01:17:07.824 --> 01:17:10.625
You do look beautiful.

01:17:10.660 --> 01:17:11.425
Dad!

01:17:18.501 --> 01:17:20.134
You wore it.

01:17:22.271 --> 01:17:23.104
were right.

01:17:23.139 --> 01:17:25.840
Uh, you and I are all
we have left.

01:17:28.277 --> 01:17:30.011
What about Aunt June?

01:17:30.046 --> 01:17:31.746
Well, it turns out the break
wasn't so bad.

01:17:31.781 --> 01:17:32.880
So, she is going to come
out here

01:17:32.915 --> 01:17:35.049
and spend Christmas with us.

01:17:35.084 --> 01:17:36.751
Oh, that's wonderful!

01:17:36.786 --> 01:17:38.352
Merry Christmas, sweetheart.

01:17:38.388 --> 01:17:40.021
Merry Christmas, dad.

01:17:44.794 --> 01:17:46.927
Oh, there are some people
that I need to talk to

01:17:46.963 --> 01:17:48.562
so go ahead and grab
a glass of champagne

01:17:48.598 --> 01:17:49.597
and I'll catch up with you.

01:17:49.632 --> 01:17:51.065
Okay, sweetie.

01:17:56.806 --> 01:17:59.540
Mrs. Fulton, Alex.

01:17:59.575 --> 01:18:00.408
Noelle.

01:18:02.145 --> 01:18:05.946
You have done wonderful work
with the gala.

01:18:05.982 --> 01:18:07.615
It's perfect.

01:18:07.650 --> 01:18:11.085
Oh, good, I am so glad
you're both happy.

01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:12.453
I was thinking though,

01:18:12.488 --> 01:18:15.589
perhaps your firefighter friend
was right.

01:18:15.625 --> 01:18:19.627
Maybe we could stand to have
a little more fun with things.

01:18:19.662 --> 01:18:20.428
Really?

01:18:20.463 --> 01:18:21.429
Really?

01:18:21.464 --> 01:18:23.464
Well, no matter how things are
supposed to be,

01:18:23.499 --> 01:18:26.901
we can always choose
to make them different.

01:18:26.936 --> 01:18:29.303
Yes, we can.

01:18:29.338 --> 01:18:31.806
I am so grateful for both of you
and I have enjoyed my time

01:18:31.841 --> 01:18:37.912
at Fulton's so much but it's
time that I go out on my own.

01:18:39.816 --> 01:18:43.617
So, I will be leaving to start
my own photography business.

01:18:43.653 --> 01:18:45.820
Noelle, that's great.

01:18:45.855 --> 01:18:48.989
But we'll miss you.

01:18:49.025 --> 01:18:50.491
Well, we certainly will.

01:18:50.526 --> 01:18:53.661
But I was looking at your
entries tonight

01:18:53.696 --> 01:18:55.296
in the photo contest.

01:18:55.331 --> 01:18:56.997
They are top-notch.

01:18:57.033 --> 01:18:58.065
Thank you.

01:18:58.101 --> 01:19:02.636
Fulton's would be honoured
to be your first client.

01:19:02.672 --> 01:19:03.471
Wouldn't we, Alex?

01:19:03.506 --> 01:19:05.139
We definitely would.

01:19:05.174 --> 01:19:06.273
You can bring that fun,

01:19:06.309 --> 01:19:09.176
creative spirit to our spring
advertising campaign.

01:19:09.212 --> 01:19:10.778
Oh, wow.

01:19:10.813 --> 01:19:14.014
That is so very generous
and I would love to.

01:19:14.050 --> 01:19:15.916
Thank you!

01:19:17.553 --> 01:19:19.653
Thank you!

01:19:19.689 --> 01:19:24.024
Now you go and enjoy this
wonderful party you planned.

01:19:24.060 --> 01:19:25.493
I will.

01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:41.642
I am so sorry about what I said.

01:19:41.677 --> 01:19:43.477
I should have never doubted you.

01:19:43.513 --> 01:19:45.179
Oh, don't be silly.

01:19:45.214 --> 01:19:47.181
How can you have faith if
you have nothing to doubt?

01:19:48.417 --> 01:19:51.819
I'm just so happy that two
of your photos in the contest.

01:19:51.854 --> 01:19:54.522
Oh, no, I just submitted
the one.

01:19:54.557 --> 01:19:59.026
Well, I guess, uh, things have a
way of working themselves out.

01:19:59.061 --> 01:20:00.494
<i>I told ya.</i>

01:20:04.867 --> 01:20:09.203
So, what you're trying to say
is if God sends me a sleigh

01:20:09.238 --> 01:20:10.704
I should get on it.

01:20:10.740 --> 01:20:12.506
Mm-hmm.

01:20:12.542 --> 01:20:15.042
And I know you will.

01:20:15.077 --> 01:20:17.044
Oh, I have something for you!

01:20:17.079 --> 01:20:18.846
Here we go.

01:20:18.881 --> 01:20:20.047
Okay now.

01:20:20.082 --> 01:20:22.883
Don't open it yet.

01:20:22.919 --> 01:20:25.786
You'll know when the right
moment comes along.

01:20:26.722 --> 01:20:27.488
Thank you.

01:20:30.259 --> 01:20:33.861
It's been lovely getting
to know you.

01:20:33.896 --> 01:20:34.862
You too.

01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:39.400
So, is this goodbye?

01:20:39.435 --> 01:20:41.502
Will I see you again?

01:20:42.939 --> 01:20:44.972
If you need me.

01:21:11.801 --> 01:21:14.602
Jake, I'm sorry.

01:21:14.637 --> 01:21:19.773
It's okay, I... I'm sorry too
about the party, and the job.

01:21:19.809 --> 01:21:21.442
Oh, uh, the job.

01:21:21.477 --> 01:21:23.043
Did you get it?

01:21:23.079 --> 01:21:24.078
I did.

01:21:25.815 --> 01:21:27.915
And I turned it down.

01:21:27.950 --> 01:21:29.617
Really? Why?

01:21:29.652 --> 01:21:31.619
Because of you.

01:21:31.654 --> 01:21:33.954
Me? What did I do?

01:21:33.990 --> 01:21:38.893
It was the picture of me
and my dad.

01:21:44.467 --> 01:21:46.300
So, what are you going
to do instead?

01:21:46.335 --> 01:21:48.602
Well, I talked to the captain
of our station,

01:21:48.638 --> 01:21:49.703
he wants to retire next year

01:21:49.739 --> 01:21:53.407
and he thinks that I would be
a good replacement.

01:21:53.442 --> 01:21:54.475
Oh.

01:21:54.510 --> 01:21:57.311
Well, I think your dad would be
very proud of you.

01:21:57.346 --> 01:21:58.412
Thank you.

01:22:03.786 --> 01:22:05.619
Would you like to dance?

01:22:08.624 --> 01:22:12.426
You know what, who cares who
the "honey, I'm home" guy is.

01:22:12.461 --> 01:22:13.427
What?

01:22:13.462 --> 01:22:14.762
Never mind.

01:22:14.797 --> 01:22:16.797
I would love to dance.

01:22:24.440 --> 01:22:25.439
Oh!

01:22:26.542 --> 01:22:27.574
Oh!

01:22:30.379 --> 01:22:31.845
These were brand new.

01:22:31.881 --> 01:22:34.415
So much for our dance.

01:22:35.551 --> 01:22:37.618
Oh, um, wait here.

01:22:53.536 --> 01:22:55.002
Well, if the right guy did
come along and ask you out,

01:22:55.037 --> 01:22:57.037
what would you say?

01:22:57.073 --> 01:22:59.807
I'd say, yes.

01:22:59.842 --> 01:23:03.644
Well great, 'cause there is
someone I'd like you to meet.

01:23:13.522 --> 01:23:14.555
Hey, honey.

01:23:14.590 --> 01:23:15.990
I'm home.

01:23:16.959 --> 01:23:19.059
That joke never gets old
with you, does it?

01:23:19.095 --> 01:23:21.061
You know, I was the one
that asked her about dating.

01:23:21.097 --> 01:23:23.230
So you could introduce her
to me.

01:23:23.265 --> 01:23:25.199
Yeah, well I still met
her first.

01:23:25.234 --> 01:23:27.735
And she did say that I was
more handsome than you.

01:23:27.770 --> 01:23:29.036
Noelle, tell him.

01:23:29.071 --> 01:23:31.905
Noelle, ignore him.

01:23:31.941 --> 01:23:32.740
You see.

01:23:32.775 --> 01:23:33.941
You see that.

01:23:33.976 --> 01:23:36.510
My little brother gets promoted
to captain of the station

01:23:36.545 --> 01:23:38.512
and now he thinks he can boss
everyone around.

01:23:38.547 --> 01:23:41.181
Well, rank has its privileges.

01:23:41.217 --> 01:23:43.250
Come on, we gotta get started
on dinner.

01:23:43.285 --> 01:23:45.185
Lots of people coming over.

01:23:56.265 --> 01:23:57.231
<i>Noelle?</i>

01:23:58.968 --> 01:24:00.667
Is everything all right?

01:24:07.109 --> 01:24:09.076
Noelle, is everything
all right?

01:24:11.247 --> 01:24:14.448
What's your brother's name?
The doctor?

01:24:14.483 --> 01:24:17.451
It's Will. Why?

01:24:17.486 --> 01:24:18.886
No reason.

01:24:18.921 --> 01:24:21.255
I would love to dance.

01:24:52.455 --> 01:24:53.887
What's going on?

01:24:56.525 --> 01:24:59.226
Oh, just livin' a little.

01:25:00.463 --> 01:25:02.262
Merry Christmas, Noelle.

01:25:02.298 --> 01:25:04.965
Merry Christmas, Jake.
