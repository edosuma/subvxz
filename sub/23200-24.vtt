01:11.813 --> 01:13.106
Are you okay?

01:14.356 --> 01:15.941
Yeah, let's check.

01:20.945 --> 01:23.279
Sorry to disappoint you, fellas.

01:25.448 --> 01:28.659
Okay, who hired you to kill Diana Prince?

01:28.909 --> 01:31.911
A voice over the phone,
the way we're always hired.

01:31.994 --> 01:33.913
I should've known.

01:33.996 --> 01:37.749
This person will call you back
for a status report, right?

01:37.832 --> 01:39.918
- Yes.
- Good.

01:40.001 --> 01:43.045
When that happens, you're going
to tell them that you succeeded.

01:43.128 --> 01:46.214
Then, after you hang up,
you'll march yourselves down...

01:46.297 --> 01:49.092
to the nearest police station
and turn yourselves in.

01:49.175 --> 01:50.926
Won't that be fun?

02:21.783 --> 02:24.785
These tunnels were built
during the Civil War.

02:24.868 --> 02:28.038
Lincoln's people insisted
that he have a place to hide...

02:28.121 --> 02:31.040
in case the Rebels took Washington.

02:31.123 --> 02:34.876
- You mean, kind of like a fallout shelter?
- That's right.

02:35.210 --> 02:39.546
We didn't even know they were down here
until we started construction.

02:39.630 --> 02:43.174
It sure made putting in
some of this wiring a lot easier.

02:44.133 --> 02:48.595
We sure did luck out,
in more ways than one.

02:51.138 --> 02:54.808
Did you build the park
before or after you...

02:56.184 --> 02:59.687
Well, Leon's a couple of years older
than I am.

03:00.395 --> 03:02.397
He missed the draft.

03:02.481 --> 03:05.316
We had to close the deal for this land...

03:05.399 --> 03:08.027
a couple of weeks before I left.

03:08.943 --> 03:11.237
He wrote to me every week in Vietnam...

03:11.321 --> 03:14.448
telling me how construction was coming.

03:14.531 --> 03:17.617
I always had a letter from Leon
in my pocket...

03:18.409 --> 03:19.911
till I was "killed. "

03:33.254 --> 03:36.423
You designed the Super Loop
and you've never even ridden it?

03:36.506 --> 03:39.759
- Yes, that's right.
- Oh, man.

03:43.304 --> 03:45.555
Tell me, what's it like?

03:47.223 --> 03:48.599
It's great.

03:49.641 --> 03:52.560
It's the neatest ride in the whole park.

03:52.643 --> 03:56.689
It kind of feels like you're flying along
on glass, it's so smooth.

03:57.022 --> 03:59.065
And when you hit the loop...

03:59.149 --> 04:02.693
it's sort of like your brains
and your stomach trade places.

04:03.527 --> 04:07.322
If I could've, I probably would've
ridden it all day.

04:07.405 --> 04:11.450
- How did you ever design it?
- I spent most of my time in school...

04:12.701 --> 04:17.413
reading up on roller coasters,
fooling around with designs...

04:17.495 --> 04:20.081
new ideas, especially coasters.

04:20.790 --> 04:22.584
All on your own? I mean...

04:22.667 --> 04:26.086
didn't you have a father or somebody
to teach you about them?

04:26.170 --> 04:29.464
- My father runs a trucking company.
- You're kidding.

04:30.465 --> 04:33.675
See, I have a scrapbook
full of roller coasters.

04:33.758 --> 04:37.678
Well, pictures of them, anyway.
They've always fascinated me.

04:37.761 --> 04:41.472
But I never figured I could ever learn
how to think up new ones.

04:41.556 --> 04:44.642
No, you don't learn how to do it.

04:44.726 --> 04:46.059
You do it.

04:50.062 --> 04:53.232
Of course, it helps
to have a little physics and math.

04:53.316 --> 04:56.401
But do you think the guy who invented
the first roller coaster...

04:56.484 --> 05:00.154
ever waited around
for somebody to teach him how to do it?

05:01.947 --> 05:06.451
I always figured I was too stupid.
I don't do real good in school.

05:08.201 --> 05:10.829
What do grades have to do with dreams?

05:12.746 --> 05:15.583
Come on. You've ridden the Super Loop.

05:15.666 --> 05:18.126
Now I'm going to show you how to run it.

05:22.671 --> 05:25.172
Diana, what on Earth happened to you?

05:25.923 --> 05:28.634
Two professional trigger boys, is what.

05:29.467 --> 05:33.263
If you think I look bad,
you ought to see the car I was driving.

05:33.346 --> 05:35.889
Where did this happen?
At the amusement park?

05:36.015 --> 05:38.683
Coming from there. Dearborn Highway.

05:38.766 --> 05:40.852
They tried to make me a traffic fatality...

05:40.935 --> 05:44.146
by encouraging my car off the road
at 55 miles an hour.

05:44.229 --> 05:45.313
And?

05:45.397 --> 05:49.024
Like I said, I'm fine.
But the car I was driving is not so great.

05:50.109 --> 05:51.734
And you think they were pros?

05:52.443 --> 05:53.987
I know they were pros, Steve.

05:54.279 --> 05:55.697
Hired by Fynch?

05:55.780 --> 05:57.197
I don't know.

05:57.281 --> 06:00.449
You know how it goes.
A voice on the phone, cash in the mail.

06:00.533 --> 06:01.993
Even if they turn themselves in...

06:02.076 --> 06:04.495
I doubt that we could nail
the person who hired them.

06:04.579 --> 06:07.539
And besides, why would Fynch
even bother?

06:08.415 --> 06:09.665
You did throw him a curve...

06:09.748 --> 06:13.252
by trying to pass information to his man
in person yesterday.

06:14.002 --> 06:15.628
You've got a point.

06:16.129 --> 06:20.257
Maybe Fynch knows that we're
on to his plan to make Fun Universe...

06:20.340 --> 06:22.800
the center of his espionage empire.

06:23.843 --> 06:25.219
Now, that could be.

06:25.302 --> 06:28.847
Well, maybe Fynch
can explain things himself.

06:29.347 --> 06:32.140
Is that bug we planted on Pierce
still operative?

06:32.224 --> 06:33.809
Sure. Listen to this.

06:41.523 --> 06:43.024
What's that?

06:43.108 --> 06:45.609
What you're hearing
is the sound of a 50-cent piece...

06:45.693 --> 06:47.027
sitting on top of a dresser.

06:47.111 --> 06:50.154
Apparently he didn't take it
into the park today.

06:50.238 --> 06:52.281
Great. That's all we need.

06:52.365 --> 06:55.909
Well, maybe he'll change clothes
before he reports to Fynch.

06:56.493 --> 06:58.911
Speaking of taking things into the park...

06:58.994 --> 07:00.955
whatever happened
to that explosive device...

07:01.038 --> 07:03.081
that Pierce intended to plant there?

07:03.998 --> 07:05.750
Oh, yeah, the bomb.

07:06.542 --> 07:08.001
Yeah, the bomb.

07:08.085 --> 07:10.379
If you don't have it,
and Pierce doesn't have it...

07:10.462 --> 07:11.504
who has it?

07:13.673 --> 07:15.423
Some creature.

07:24.472 --> 07:27.600
I'm telling you this creature
is a figment of their imagination.

07:27.684 --> 07:31.269
Ten employees with exactly
the same imaginations. Interesting.

07:31.353 --> 07:33.688
Maybe they all smoke
the same brand of dope.

07:33.771 --> 07:36.607
When Was the first time
someone reported seeing it?

07:38.024 --> 07:41.152
I don't know.
A year, a year and a half ago.

07:42.861 --> 07:44.571
And who was it that reported it?

07:44.655 --> 07:46.697
I don't know.
He doesn't work here anymore.

07:46.781 --> 07:48.032
Why not?

07:48.825 --> 07:52.077
This is an amusement park.
There's a high rate of employee turnover.

07:52.160 --> 07:54.371
Did you fire him, Mr. Gurney?

07:54.454 --> 07:57.665
Did you do to him what you
threatened to do to all employees...

07:57.748 --> 08:00.375
that told you they've seen
this non-existent creature?

08:01.042 --> 08:03.086
Listen, anybody who works...

08:03.169 --> 08:05.504
in an amusement park
that caters to children...

08:05.587 --> 08:08.631
has no business spreading
irresponsible rumors about monsters.

08:09.298 --> 08:13.176
Despite all the reports from employees
you received over the past year...

08:13.259 --> 08:15.929
you never saw fit to call the police?

08:16.012 --> 08:18.555
Why? I mean, he doesn't do any harm.

08:18.889 --> 08:21.349
At least you do admit it exists.

08:22.141 --> 08:24.060
I don't have to admit anything.

08:24.143 --> 08:27.562
Well, how about the fact
that a kid is missing in your park?

08:28.355 --> 08:31.232
Like it or not,
that's what we got here, Mr. Gurney.

08:31.315 --> 08:32.732
And you can bet...

08:32.816 --> 08:35.860
I'm gonna keep digging
until I find out what happened to him.

08:36.318 --> 08:40.155
And if, in doing so, I dig up
what you're trying to hide...

08:40.948 --> 08:42.818
it would suit me fine.

08:56.039 --> 08:58.083
Davey, I'm gonna blow it.

09:07.134 --> 09:08.385
Sandy?

09:10.887 --> 09:12.639
- Yes, sir?
- I'm going out.

09:18.478 --> 09:20.230
Harrison Fynch here.

09:24.317 --> 09:25.652
Marvelous.

09:27.946 --> 09:30.031
Didn't I tell you? Where there's a will...

09:30.115 --> 09:31.491
and enough money...

09:31.700 --> 09:33.243
there's a way.

09:33.994 --> 09:36.955
Listen, I realize that ridding the world
of Diana Prince...

09:37.038 --> 09:40.959
has done the people of your profession
a great service, as well as mine...

09:41.042 --> 09:44.796
but that must remain
our little secret, mustn't it?

09:45.630 --> 09:48.883
Of course. Thank you.

10:19.664 --> 10:23.376
With these, I can tell the position
of each car on the track.

10:23.459 --> 10:25.336
Over here...

10:26.421 --> 10:29.423
I can monitor how the track is holding up.

10:29.507 --> 10:32.009
- It looks like a computer.
- It is.

10:32.093 --> 10:34.595
It's constantly analyzing stress factors...

10:34.679 --> 10:38.516
and determining how and by when
each weakness should be corrected.

10:39.141 --> 10:41.310
What if something went wrong...

10:41.394 --> 10:43.688
really wrong, all of a sudden?

10:43.771 --> 10:47.191
Over here, this alarm will ring.

10:47.650 --> 10:49.151
Then I can prevent another car...

10:49.235 --> 10:51.362
from being dispatched
and put into danger.

10:52.321 --> 10:54.532
- Has that ever happened?
- No.

10:55.866 --> 10:59.203
It's a very well-designed ride.

11:00.621 --> 11:04.041
With you down here, it's kind of like
it has a guardian angel.

11:04.125 --> 11:05.960
This isn't the alarm.

11:07.545 --> 11:11.465
How would you like to be
the guardian angel for a little while?

11:12.967 --> 11:14.176
Sure.

11:15.219 --> 11:17.429
Great. You don't have to touch anything.

11:17.513 --> 11:20.099
Just watch and listen. I'll be right back.

11:25.062 --> 11:26.438
You idiot.

11:27.982 --> 11:29.566
You left it there?

11:30.150 --> 11:34.321
I'm telling you,
I've never seen anything so...

11:34.905 --> 11:37.491
hideous in all my life.

11:37.574 --> 11:39.243
Its face was...

11:42.079 --> 11:44.832
I was scared to death, Mr. Fynch.

11:44.957 --> 11:48.710
Do you realize, Mr. Pierce,
that if that device is recovered...

11:48.794 --> 11:51.296
it could be traced to me?

11:51.713 --> 11:52.798
I could be ruined.

11:52.881 --> 11:54.633
Nobody's gonna be looking for it.

11:54.716 --> 11:58.762
And with that thing hanging around,
nobody's likely to find it, either.

11:58.845 --> 12:01.431
This whole thing disturbs me greatly.

12:02.849 --> 12:06.144
Diana Prince tried to get in
to see the park owner.

12:06.770 --> 12:10.065
I think it might be wise
to postpone my plans for now.

12:10.148 --> 12:13.777
There's only one way he could have known
I tried to see Gurney.

12:19.783 --> 12:22.994
The service in this hotel
is highly commendable.

12:25.914 --> 12:29.292
Mr. Pierce, would you take care
of the gentleman's gratuity?

12:30.627 --> 12:33.213
- It's funny.
- What's that?

12:34.130 --> 12:37.759
Tipping is all that 50-cent pieces
are good for these days.

12:41.388 --> 12:43.014
Cheapskate.

12:43.515 --> 12:45.934
There goes that little ball game.

12:46.851 --> 12:48.520
At least, we know one thing...

12:48.603 --> 12:50.146
whoever made that bomb for Fynch...

12:50.230 --> 12:52.315
is certainly able,
and possibly even willing...

12:52.399 --> 12:54.651
to talk about other things
he's done for him.

12:54.734 --> 12:56.986
You think the creature in the park
recovered it?

12:57.070 --> 12:58.822
It doesn't really matter, Steve.

12:58.905 --> 13:00.865
Fynch has bugged Leon Gurney's office.

13:00.949 --> 13:02.450
- Which means-
- Which means...

13:02.534 --> 13:05.453
we can't very well look for a bomb
Pierce left in the park...

13:05.537 --> 13:06.871
without Fynch knowing about it.

13:06.955 --> 13:09.999
Which means that if we're smart...

13:10.083 --> 13:13.503
we can make Fynch
play right into our hands.

13:20.927 --> 13:23.721
The last bus left about an hour ago.

13:24.514 --> 13:28.684
Come on. Get over here, will you?
I don't have a whole lot of time.

13:28.768 --> 13:32.313
I thought you were going to give me
at least another week.

13:32.980 --> 13:36.609
Yeah, well, something's come up.
I got to talk to you sooner. Come on.

13:36.692 --> 13:39.111
- Look, yesterday some kid-
- How was the party?

13:39.195 --> 13:41.280
- What?
- Did Dad like his present?

13:41.697 --> 13:43.533
Oh, the birthday. Yeah, he did.

13:43.616 --> 13:45.868
He loved the radio. Davey, you done good.

13:45.952 --> 13:48.788
- You did good.
- Only trouble is...

13:49.455 --> 13:52.375
he keeps bugging me now.
He wants to find out where I got it.

13:52.458 --> 13:55.878
He wants to outfit the fleet
with 50 radios just like it.

13:55.961 --> 13:58.381
You feel like making 50 CBs just like that?

13:58.464 --> 14:01.384
I know. I should have
stuck a brand name on it.

14:01.467 --> 14:04.595
- That's too subtle.
- Well, Dead Sons Unlimited, or...

14:06.597 --> 14:09.058
- Cadaver Corporation?
- That's sick.

14:09.725 --> 14:14.396
Davey, yesterday, a boy
disappeared from the park.

14:16.023 --> 14:19.026
And he is down here with you,
isn't he, Davey?

14:26.492 --> 14:29.578
- He is down here, isn't he, Davey?
- So what?

14:30.287 --> 14:33.582
So all hell is breaking loose upstairs,
that's what.

14:33.666 --> 14:36.669
- Well, it shouldn't have happened.
- Well, it is, Davey.

14:37.086 --> 14:40.297
The cops are involved now.
They're really involved.

14:40.381 --> 14:43.926
Doesn't exactly sell ride tickets,
you know what I mean?

14:44.927 --> 14:46.970
You know what you got to do.

14:47.054 --> 14:50.098
No, I can't let him go.
He'll tell people I'm here.

14:50.182 --> 14:52.309
What do you think they're gonna find out...

14:52.392 --> 14:54.603
when they tear this place apart
looking for him?

14:54.686 --> 14:57.439
Now, you gotta stop hiding out
and come upstairs.

14:57.523 --> 14:58.607
No.

15:00.817 --> 15:03.237
Davey, you don't have a choice.

15:04.446 --> 15:07.866
Now, think, what's it gonna look like
when they come down here...

15:07.950 --> 15:12.120
and they find a boy is held captive
by the monster of Fun Universe?

15:12.204 --> 15:14.915
Do you want your face plastered
on every newspaper...

15:14.998 --> 15:16.750
between here and Seattle, Washington?

15:16.833 --> 15:19.795
No, Leon. Don't let that happen, please.

15:19.878 --> 15:23.381
Davey, I don't know if I can stop it.
You've got to help me.

15:23.965 --> 15:27.135
I'm saying I need you, up top.

15:28.136 --> 15:31.973
I'm saying that I'm too bad-tempered,
I'm too scatterbrained...

15:32.057 --> 15:34.184
I'm too careless to get us
through this thing.

15:34.267 --> 15:37.187
And I'm scared to death
I'm gonna lose us the park.

15:39.898 --> 15:41.483
No, I can do...

15:42.067 --> 15:45.111
more for you down here
than I can up there.

15:47.280 --> 15:50.200
You're doing this for yourself,
and you know it.

15:52.410 --> 15:54.829
Think it over. I'll be in touch.

15:58.291 --> 16:01.085
Look a little less government-agent-ish?

16:01.169 --> 16:04.297
- Much better, Mr. Peters.
- Peters?

16:04.380 --> 16:07.300
Bill Peters, of Eagleton Inspection.

16:07.383 --> 16:09.344
Everything is all set.

16:09.928 --> 16:11.804
But I'd advise you to enter talking...

16:11.888 --> 16:14.182
and not let Leon Gurney
get one word in edgewise...

16:14.265 --> 16:16.643
until you put this in front of him.

16:16.726 --> 16:18.478
I hope he doesn't screw things up.

16:18.561 --> 16:20.980
I wish there was some way
we could get word to him...

16:21.064 --> 16:22.440
what we're trying to do.

16:22.523 --> 16:23.983
That's too risky, Steve.

16:24.067 --> 16:26.444
All we know is that Fynch
has that office bugged.

16:26.527 --> 16:28.905
Now, it could be the phone,
the intercom, whatever.

16:28.988 --> 16:32.492
We've got to make sure Fynch overhears
only what we want him to overhear.

16:32.575 --> 16:34.994
Which ride is it
that's going to develop the problem?

16:35.078 --> 16:38.831
- I believe it's your favorite, Steve.
- The one that goes upside-down?

16:40.541 --> 16:41.876
The Super Loop.

17:12.323 --> 17:15.075
- Everything's okay.
- Good.

17:16.327 --> 17:18.579
Is this all you do all day...

17:18.662 --> 17:21.832
just stay down here
and watch over the Super Loop?

17:21.915 --> 17:23.083
No.

17:25.085 --> 17:28.088
- I do designs.
- For more coasters?

17:28.839 --> 17:30.132
Here.

17:31.425 --> 17:32.468
No.

17:33.844 --> 17:37.097
For other rides, too.
I send them up top to Leon.

17:37.181 --> 17:41.602
He applies for patents
to those he thinks will work.

17:42.269 --> 17:44.772
- Can I take a look?
- Sure.

17:45.481 --> 17:47.107
Oh, the bomb.

17:47.608 --> 17:48.650
Here.

17:53.614 --> 17:56.283
Are you gonna tell your brother about it?

17:57.701 --> 17:58.994
No.

18:00.037 --> 18:02.706
Right now, it's the worst thing I could do.

18:04.666 --> 18:09.254
Hi, I'm Bill Peters,
Eagleton Inspection Service.

18:12.257 --> 18:14.384
Me and my boys checked over
your steel coaster.

18:17.012 --> 18:19.598
Your maintenance men
have been doing a fine job.

18:21.725 --> 18:24.644
Must be that pep talk
I gave them last month.

18:32.194 --> 18:34.070
"I'm glad to hear
you found nothing wrong. "

18:34.154 --> 18:36.114
I didn't say that now, did I?

18:36.198 --> 18:39.576
As a matter of fact, there's a section
of your Super Loop track...

18:39.659 --> 18:42.162
that's going to need some work real soon.

18:44.205 --> 18:46.791
There are several minor problems,
but the worst one is...

18:46.875 --> 18:51.796
Section Number 38.
That's where the 360 meets the exit track.

18:52.422 --> 18:53.923
Seems to be a little bit strained.

18:54.007 --> 18:56.760
Have somebody look at it
within the next five days or so.

18:56.843 --> 18:58.970
After all, wouldn't want anything
to go wrong...

18:59.095 --> 19:01.931
that's the ride that the park is
famous for, right?

19:02.974 --> 19:05.685
"I'll have my people check it out
on Tuesday. "

19:05.769 --> 19:09.439
That's real good.
Well, it's always a pleasure, Mr. Gurney.

19:10.190 --> 19:13.943
"Right. Thank you, Mr. Peters. "

19:30.793 --> 19:32.128
Excuse me.

19:32.587 --> 19:35.089
- What?
- I want you to go to Fun Universe...

19:35.173 --> 19:39.302
and find out everything you can
about a ride called the Super Loop.

19:39.552 --> 19:42.680
I thought we were going to forget
about the amusement park...

19:42.764 --> 19:46.058
until we could figure out
how the IADC fit in.

19:46.142 --> 19:48.311
Can't afford to now, Mr. Pierce.

19:48.394 --> 19:50.521
Not when we have
the perfect opportunity...

19:50.605 --> 19:54.108
to make Mr. Leon Gurney
look extremely negligent.

19:54.859 --> 19:57.653
And to make that bomb
you inadvertently left behind...

19:57.778 --> 19:59.196
inconsequential.

20:41.572 --> 20:44.074
Wow! Three loops!

20:44.658 --> 20:47.202
And a coaster like that would really work?

20:47.286 --> 20:50.289
As long as its centrifugal force
is utilized.

20:51.040 --> 20:53.250
Could you have more than three loops?

20:53.333 --> 20:56.712
If the design is sound,
you can have 300 loops.

21:00.257 --> 21:01.967
Teach me, will you?

21:02.050 --> 21:05.220
I want to learn all there is to know
about roller coasters.

21:05.304 --> 21:09.391
Someday, I want to design the biggest,
fastest steel coaster in the world.

21:10.767 --> 21:13.395
- How about a hamburger, first?
- Sure.

21:13.812 --> 21:16.648
- And French fries and a root beer?
- No.

21:16.732 --> 21:19.234
Salad and a glass of milk.

21:19.318 --> 21:22.154
As long as we're helping ourselves
to my brother's food...

21:22.237 --> 21:24.448
it might as well be good food.

21:27.409 --> 21:29.745
You don't have to worry about me...

21:29.828 --> 21:32.706
leaving and telling people
you're down here.

21:33.123 --> 21:36.793
There's nothing for me up top,
so I'm not going anywhere.

21:48.597 --> 21:51.641
Please, hold all calls. Thank you.

21:58.565 --> 22:00.233
How good of Mr. Cline to provide us...

22:00.317 --> 22:02.777
with a demonstration model
of his latest creation.

22:03.403 --> 22:04.487
He said no problem.

22:04.571 --> 22:07.449
I think he likes to show off,
and I don't blame him.

22:07.532 --> 22:09.242
Wait till you see this.

22:09.743 --> 22:12.036
I take it, you avoided telling him
what happened...

22:12.120 --> 22:14.706
to the bomb he prepared for you
the other day.

22:14.789 --> 22:16.666
The subject never came up.

22:18.668 --> 22:21.963
He's a real professional, Mr. Cline.
Works fast...

22:22.922 --> 22:25.925
never asks any questions,
and keeps his mouth shut.

22:26.551 --> 22:29.220
That's why I've done
business with him through the years.

22:29.304 --> 22:31.514
And which is why we must see
that the authorities...

22:31.598 --> 22:33.308
never see fit to interrogate him.

22:33.391 --> 22:35.435
Because one step from Mr. Cline...

22:36.227 --> 22:37.270
is me.

22:39.647 --> 22:40.898
And you.

22:41.566 --> 22:45.570
Like you said, major disasters
have a tendency of...

22:46.738 --> 22:49.198
refocusing people's attentions.

22:50.116 --> 22:51.909
Well put.

22:52.410 --> 22:54.036
- Now, tell me-
- Here we go.

22:57.540 --> 23:02.503
This is made of the same alloy
as the Super Loop at Fun Universe.

23:02.879 --> 23:05.590
It's solid steel. Feel it.

23:08.092 --> 23:10.553
- Indeed, it is.
- Now, watch.

23:11.595 --> 23:14.181
This device, when activated...

23:14.265 --> 23:18.644
sets up a specific pattern
of ultrasonic vibrations.

23:19.603 --> 23:20.688
Observe.

23:23.566 --> 23:24.984
Even as we talk...

23:25.067 --> 23:28.696
the molecular structure
of this solid piece of steel...

23:28.946 --> 23:30.614
is being rearranged...

23:30.698 --> 23:34.076
creating what is known as metal fatigue.

23:36.787 --> 23:39.081
Nothing appears to be happening.

23:39.999 --> 23:42.042
That's the beauty of it.

23:44.003 --> 23:48.215
- I like it, Mr. Pierce.
- You'll like this part even better, Mr. F.

23:49.383 --> 23:52.720
Now, it'll take a little longer
on the roller coaster but, here.

23:52.803 --> 23:54.471
- What?
- Try to bend it.

23:54.555 --> 23:56.306
- Oh, come, now.
- Go on.

24:01.437 --> 24:05.524
- Look at that!
- Now, this is the best part.

24:19.288 --> 24:22.666
Major disasters also have a tendency
of creating...

24:23.000 --> 24:24.668
major investigations.

24:25.252 --> 24:26.295
But in this case...

24:27.087 --> 24:30.173
something like this
is all anyone is going to find.

24:30.966 --> 24:32.968
He thought of everything.

24:34.136 --> 24:37.764
One amusement park,
compliments of Mr. Cline.

24:48.817 --> 24:53.029
I've got absolutely nothing to report,
Steve, for the third day in a row.

24:53.113 --> 24:56.074
Looks like Fynch didn't
take our bait after all.

24:56.157 --> 24:58.451
Yeah, all our people have reported in.

24:58.535 --> 25:00.328
All except for Schneider, that is.

25:00.412 --> 25:03.498
He's still out on his regular
morning inspection crew.

25:04.165 --> 25:06.001
Okay, ciao.

25:37.907 --> 25:40.201
Well, she's clean as a whistle.

26:21.200 --> 26:22.493
Okay.

26:25.663 --> 26:26.831
Good.

26:31.377 --> 26:34.130
It's all there. You can count it later.

26:34.880 --> 26:37.550
- You sure nobody's gonna get hurt?
- No.

26:38.509 --> 26:40.845
All this is gonna do is shut down...

26:40.928 --> 26:43.681
the most popular ride in the park
for a couple of days.

26:43.764 --> 26:45.558
You won't mind that, will you?

26:45.641 --> 26:48.852
- Seeing Leon Gurney squirm a little?
- Sure wouldn't.

27:19.967 --> 27:22.636
Aren't you afraid it's gonna explode?

27:22.719 --> 27:25.013
No, I've disconnected the detonator.

27:38.068 --> 27:40.195
This thing's a work of art.

28:32.038 --> 28:33.540
Randy?

29:15.831 --> 29:16.999
Randy?

29:42.441 --> 29:43.567
Randy!

30:29.905 --> 30:31.156
Wait!

30:39.164 --> 30:40.540
She followed me down here.

30:40.624 --> 30:43.168
What were you doing up top?
Have I told you never to go?

30:43.251 --> 30:45.337
I just wanted to get you
another cup of coffee.

30:45.420 --> 30:47.381
What am I going to do with her?

30:47.464 --> 30:50.217
Why didn't you use your head?
What am I going to do?

30:50.300 --> 30:51.593
Come on, you.

31:11.780 --> 31:13.949
She'll keep her mouth shut.
Won't you, lady?

31:14.032 --> 31:16.493
You got no reason to say anything
to anyone?

31:18.078 --> 31:19.329
Who are you, anyway?

31:19.412 --> 31:20.705
David Gurney.

31:20.789 --> 31:24.125
His brother owns the park,
so it's okay that we're down here.

31:24.209 --> 31:26.294
We're not causing any harm.

31:27.170 --> 31:28.922
You live down here?

31:29.005 --> 31:31.424
These tunnels were built during
the Civil War...

31:31.508 --> 31:35.011
as part of an emergency plan
to evacuate the capitol.

31:36.888 --> 31:38.848
My name is Diana Prince.

31:46.314 --> 31:48.107
You do have the bomb.

31:49.192 --> 31:51.069
What do you know about it?

31:51.152 --> 31:54.405
No wonder Fynch was so worried,
it's tailor-made.

31:54.739 --> 31:57.408
- Listen, I'm with the IADC.
- IADC?

31:57.492 --> 31:59.494
We can trace these components.

31:59.577 --> 32:01.704
It's the evidence we've needed
for three years.

32:01.788 --> 32:03.498
With this we can indict and convict...

32:03.581 --> 32:05.875
the man behind the country's biggest
espionage ring.

32:05.958 --> 32:09.629
No, I can't let you leave here.
You'll ruin everything for me.

32:10.922 --> 32:12.924
There's something's wrong
with the Super Loop.

32:17.303 --> 32:19.722
There's something wrong in Section 38.

32:19.805 --> 32:21.807
The car's just been dispatched!

32:54.757 --> 32:58.219
- Don't they know about this up top?
- No, they only monitor the tracks.

32:58.302 --> 33:01.096
The force of that car coming off
that section...

33:01.180 --> 33:03.849
is going to shatter the whole loop.

33:04.850 --> 33:06.226
Come on.

33:36.048 --> 33:38.884
What if they see you?
What if they find out about you?

33:38.967 --> 33:42.804
It doesn't matter.
We have to stop that train.

33:43.096 --> 33:45.015
Come on!

35:34.206 --> 35:37.126
- What's happened?
- Everything is all right.

35:39.170 --> 35:41.589
- That lady escaped.
- I let her go.

35:43.049 --> 35:47.344
- She'll tell people David's down here.
- No, believe me, she won't.

35:49.180 --> 35:52.475
Besides, maybe it wouldn't be so bad
if people knew.

35:52.558 --> 35:55.853
No, the last thing I want to do is
inflict myself...

35:55.936 --> 35:58.856
- on people I used to know.
- Your brother wouldn't care.

35:58.939 --> 36:01.984
No, it doesn't matter to Leon how I look.

36:02.067 --> 36:03.569
It's the others...

36:03.652 --> 36:06.363
people he has to work with, deal with.

36:06.447 --> 36:08.365
To them, I'd be a freak.

36:09.116 --> 36:11.827
Besides, I think to cope with that...

36:11.910 --> 36:16.040
he has to know that there's nothing he can
do to make me any better.

36:16.123 --> 36:18.125
It would tear him apart.

36:18.792 --> 36:22.796
- Leon doesn't know?
- Yes, he knows that I live down here.

36:22.880 --> 36:25.716
He keeps me down here.
I help him run the park.

36:26.550 --> 36:30.512
I love my brother.
Please don't make me hurt him.

36:31.763 --> 36:33.640
We were very close...

36:34.474 --> 36:37.060
but the best thing I could do now...

36:37.144 --> 36:39.563
is to stay very far away from him.

36:43.275 --> 36:45.319
I belong down here.

36:48.739 --> 36:52.576
I think you're wrong, David.
You underestimate people.

36:54.036 --> 36:56.830
The only person keeping you
down here is you.

36:57.414 --> 37:00.751
Maybe that's something you've got to
learn for yourself.

37:01.251 --> 37:05.255
But there is one thing you can do
for Leon, and the IADC.

37:06.590 --> 37:09.176
The bomb. I'd like to take it with me.

37:10.927 --> 37:12.429
I'll get it.

37:19.019 --> 37:21.521
I'm going to take you with me, too.

37:22.772 --> 37:25.650
I guess I did almost get David
caught today.

37:26.651 --> 37:29.571
I'm so stupid it'd probably happen again.

37:29.654 --> 37:31.531
You're not stupid, Randy.

37:31.614 --> 37:35.535
It's just that this just isn't the right
kind of life for you, down here.

37:35.994 --> 37:39.289
What am I supposed to say when people
ask me where I've been?

37:39.372 --> 37:40.582
Nothing.

37:40.665 --> 37:43.710
After I use this,
you won't remember anything.

37:48.882 --> 37:51.467
He's the neatest person I've ever met.

37:53.219 --> 37:55.638
Well, maybe, someday David will realize...

37:55.722 --> 37:59.642
that there are many people capable
of having the same feelings about him.

38:01.144 --> 38:04.564
Listen, do I have to forget everything?

38:08.818 --> 38:10.695
No, maybe not everything.

38:18.786 --> 38:20.204
I don't know.

38:20.955 --> 38:24.333
I don't know, Mr. F.
She just showed up out of nowhere.

38:24.417 --> 38:28.254
All I know is they must be on to us.
What are we gonna do?

38:30.423 --> 38:34.802
Now, now, Mr. Pierce, we can't have
you warning Mr. Fynch.

38:35.177 --> 38:37.179
He might get away...

38:37.263 --> 38:39.932
before you have a chance
to tell me where he is.

39:34.403 --> 39:35.737
Taxi!

40:17.779 --> 40:21.283
Well, of all people to bump into.
Hello, Mr. Fynch.

40:22.325 --> 40:26.663
- You got nothing on me, Wonder Woman.
- Really? How about a bomb?

40:26.746 --> 40:30.959
The bomb that your friend Mr. Pierce
planted at Fun Universe last week.

40:31.042 --> 40:34.087
You haven't got that bomb.
You're bluffing me.

40:34.170 --> 40:37.632
It's true, I don't have it.
But the IADC does.

40:37.716 --> 40:40.051
And as soon as they trace those
custom-made parts...

40:40.135 --> 40:42.429
so will the Attorney General's Office.

40:43.680 --> 40:45.557
That's right, Mr. Fynch.

40:45.765 --> 40:49.978
You've tapped your last wire
and all because of a perceptual error.

40:50.311 --> 40:54.023
You see, to you Fun Universe was
just a convenient place...

40:54.107 --> 40:56.317
to pursue illegal activities.

40:56.943 --> 41:00.697
But to others, it's a place where
there are roller coasters.

41:24.137 --> 41:27.014
Yeah, he planted it there
on his visit to your office.

41:27.098 --> 41:30.393
In fact, that's probably the only reason
he came here in person.

41:30.476 --> 41:34.021
- Smart man, that Harrison.
- It's Fynch. Harrison Fynch.

41:35.898 --> 41:38.442
Whatever. As long as he's gone.

41:38.985 --> 41:40.361
He's that, all right.

41:40.444 --> 41:42.238
The man who made that bomb for him...

41:42.321 --> 41:44.699
hasn't stopped talking since
they hauled him in.

41:44.782 --> 41:48.661
Fynch has a long stay in the federal
penitentiary to look forward to.

41:49.203 --> 41:51.997
That kid who disappeared,
he's reappeared...

41:52.081 --> 41:55.835
and the Super Loop is gonna be back
in operation next week.

41:55.918 --> 41:57.503
Everything's getting back to normal.

41:58.671 --> 42:01.924
The Super Loop coaster is a steel one
as opposed to a wooden one...

42:02.007 --> 42:05.177
so that the cars clamp down on a track
instead of riding on top...

42:05.261 --> 42:06.846
which makes for a smoother ride.

42:06.929 --> 42:10.891
Randy, will you please just tell me
where you've been for the last five days?

42:10.975 --> 42:12.601
I don't know where I've been.

42:12.685 --> 42:15.396
All I know is someday,
I'm going to design the biggest...

42:15.479 --> 42:18.399
fastest, scariest steel coaster
in the world.

42:20.693 --> 42:24.238
I know that we've caused you some
awkward moments, Mr. Gurney...

42:24.321 --> 42:28.409
but I want to apologize as well as say
thank you for all your cooperation.

42:32.788 --> 42:34.123
Mr. Gurney?

43:05.112 --> 43:06.697
Welcome home.

43:45.110 --> 43:45.431
