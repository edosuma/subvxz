WEBVTT

00:13.340 --> 00:15.638
YOU OK?

00:17.250 --> 00:18.706
YEAH, I'M OK.

00:18.750 --> 00:21.048
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

00:26.160 --> 00:28.458
AH, IT'S SAVANNAH.

00:28.490 --> 00:30.481
SHE WANTS TO MEET
FOR DINNER TONIGHT

00:30.530 --> 00:33.294
BECAUSE WE NEED TO TALK.

00:33.330 --> 00:36.265
OH, MA'DON.

00:36.300 --> 00:38.268
YEAH, TRUST ME.

00:38.300 --> 00:40.188
I'VE GOTTEN THIS TEXT
ENOUGH TIMES IN THE PAST

00:40.240 --> 00:41.593
TO KNOW IT AIN'T GOOD.

00:41.640 --> 00:45.428
HEY, LOOK.
ALL I KNOW IS SAVANNAH
IS A WONDERFUL WOMAN

00:45.470 --> 00:47.574
AND YOU TWO
LOVE EACH OTHER.

00:47.610 --> 00:49.271
YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE.

00:49.310 --> 00:51.073
YEAH?

00:51.110 --> 00:53.271
NO. YOU'RE PROBABLY
COMPLETELY SCREWED,

00:53.320 --> 00:54.776
BUT GOOD LUCK ANYWAY.

00:54.820 --> 00:57.084
GOOD LUCK WITH WHAT?

00:57.120 --> 00:58.712
NOTHING. NOTHING.

00:58.750 --> 01:01.184
SAVANNAH SAYS
THEY NEED TO TALK.

01:01.220 --> 01:02.687
UH-OH.

01:02.730 --> 01:04.186
OK, YOU KNOW WHAT?
BOTH OF YOU, THANK YOU.

01:04.230 --> 01:05.652
YOU GUYS ARE SO HELPFUL.

01:05.690 --> 01:07.191
OK, OK. HERE'S ME
BEING HELPFUL.

01:07.230 --> 01:09.698
UH, THE GOOD NEWS IS
THAT YOUR "WE NEED
TO TALK" TALK

01:09.730 --> 01:12.631
WITH YOUR FABULOUS
LADY LOVE IS GONNA
HAVE TO WAIT, BUT...

01:12.670 --> 01:15.195
LET ME GUESS. THE BAD NEWS
IS WE GOT OURSELVES A CASE.

01:15.240 --> 01:17.231
YEAH, AND IT'S REAL BAD.
SO, SADDLE UP, COWBOYS,

01:17.270 --> 01:20.376
'CAUSE HOTCH SAYS
YOU NEED TO
GET LEAVING ASAP.

01:20.410 --> 01:23.379
SO, YOU HAVE A LITTLE
REPRIEVE FOR NOW,

01:23.410 --> 01:26.709
BUT TAKE IT FROM ME,
SHORT OF FAKING
A HEART ATTACK,

01:26.750 --> 01:30.345
THERE'S NO WAY
TO AVOID THE INEVITABLE.

01:36.590 --> 01:38.353
LOS ANGELES,
HERE WE COME AGAIN.

01:38.390 --> 01:40.551
EARLIER THIS MORNING,
ISABELLA JAYNE WAS FOUND

01:40.600 --> 01:42.568
IN HER HOME
IN ATWATER VILLAGE.

01:42.600 --> 01:45.524
THIS COMES ON THE HEELS
OF GERTRUDE SMILES
BEING DISCOVERED

01:45.570 --> 01:48.232
IN HER HOUSE IN EAGLE ROCK
5 MILES AWAY.

01:48.270 --> 01:52.570
BOTH WOMEN HAD BEEN
WRAPPED UP AND LEFI'
IN THEIR BEDROOMS,

01:52.610 --> 01:55.408
GERTRUDE IN A RUG,
ISABELLA IN HER OWN SHEETS.

01:55.440 --> 01:58.273
PRELIM M.E. REPORT SAYS
THAT BOTH VICTIMS DIED
OF ASPHYXIATION.

01:58.310 --> 02:00.141
WERE THERE ANY OTHER SIGNS
OF PHYSICAL TRAUMA?

02:00.180 --> 02:01.147
Garcia: NONE.

02:01.180 --> 02:02.613
SO SUFFOCATING THEM
GETS HIM OFF.

02:02.650 --> 02:05.289
WE'VE SEEN EROTIC
ASPHYXIATION BEFORE,
BUT THIS IS DIFFERENT.

02:05.320 --> 02:07.459
I MEAN, HE'S COMPLETELY
ENCAPSULATING THESE WOMEN.

02:07.490 --> 02:09.424
IT SOUNDS LIKE REMORSE.
MAYBE THE UNSUB
KNEW HIS VICTIMS.

02:09.460 --> 02:11.257
BOTH OF THEM ARE SINGLE.
IT'S POSSIBLE

02:11.290 --> 02:12.928
HE'S ROMANTICALLY
INVOLVED WITH THEM.

02:12.960 --> 02:15.827
OR THEY'RE SURROGATES
FOR SOMEONE HE FEELS
GUILTY ABOUT KILLING.

02:15.860 --> 02:17.760
WHATEVER THE REASON,
THERE'S SOMETHING
ABOUT WRAPPING THEM

02:17.800 --> 02:19.290
THAT'S IMPORTANT TO HIM.

02:19.340 --> 02:20.432
THERE'S NO SIGN OF BURGLARY
OF FORCED ENTRY.

02:20.470 --> 02:22.301
SOMEHOW HE'S
TALKING HIS WAY IN.

02:22.340 --> 02:23.762
SO THEY KNEW HIM
OR HE USED A RUSE.

02:23.810 --> 02:25.505
BABY GIRL,
ANY CONNECTION JUMP UP?

02:25.540 --> 02:27.201
NOTHING YET,
BUT I'M STILL DIGGING.

02:27.240 --> 02:29.276
MY GUT SAYS RUSE.
CHARM AND HARM.

02:29.310 --> 02:31.278
HE SMOOTH TALKS WOMEN
TO GAIN THEIR TRUST,

02:31.310 --> 02:33.449
AND THEN WHEN THEY
LET DOWN THEIR GUARD,

02:33.480 --> 02:34.139
HE TURNS ON THEM.

02:34.180 --> 02:35.772
WELL, TWO VICTIMS
IN TWO DAYS.

02:35.820 --> 02:37.310
WHATEVER HE'S DOING
WORKS.

02:37.350 --> 02:40.183
IT COULD TURN INTO A SPREE.
WHEELS UP IN 30.

02:45.460 --> 02:47.849
[KNOCKING]

02:50.230 --> 02:51.322
YES?

02:51.370 --> 02:52.496
GOOD MORNING, MA'AM.
SORRY TO BOTHER YOU,

02:52.540 --> 02:55.395
BUT WE'RE INVESTIGATING
AN INCIDENT
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

02:55.440 --> 02:56.600
I'M NOT SURE IF YOU'RE AWARE,

02:56.640 --> 02:59.837
BUT THERE WAS A HOME
INVASION YESTERDAY
ABOUT A BLOCK OVER.

02:59.880 --> 03:02.348
OH, MY GOSH,
IS EVERYONE OK?

03:02.380 --> 03:04.405
WELL, UNFORTUNATELY,
A WOMAN WAS KILLED.

03:04.450 --> 03:06.611
WE'RE HOPING WITH
THE COOPERATION
OF THE COMMUNITY,

03:06.650 --> 03:08.379
WE CAN GET HIM
BEFORE HE STRIKES AGAIN.

03:08.420 --> 03:09.444
OF COURSE.

03:09.490 --> 03:11.378
DO YOU HAVE A FEW MINUTES
TO ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS?

03:11.420 --> 03:14.218
I'M NOT EVEN SURE
HOW I CAN HELP.

03:14.260 --> 03:16.387
WELL, MA'AM, IT'S POSSIBLE
THAT YOU SAW SOMETHING,

03:16.430 --> 03:18.648
YOU DON'T REALIZE
ITS SIGNIFICANCE.

03:18.690 --> 03:21.454
BUT IF NOW'S
NOT A GOOD TIME...

03:22.470 --> 03:23.869
IT'S FINE.

03:23.900 --> 03:25.561
PLEASE COME IN.

03:27.940 --> 03:29.828
YOU'RE NOT ALLERGIC
TO CATS, ARE YOU?

03:29.870 --> 03:30.837
NO.

03:30.870 --> 03:31.837
I HAVE TWO.

03:31.870 --> 03:33.428
THEY'RE SOMEWHERE AROUND HERE.

03:33.480 --> 03:36.574
A SINGLE WOMAN WITH CATS.
I SOUND LIKE A CLICHE.

03:36.610 --> 03:37.907
NO, NOT AT ALL.

03:37.950 --> 03:39.349
PLEASE HAVE A SEAT.

03:39.380 --> 03:40.347
CAN I GET YOUR NAME?

03:40.380 --> 03:41.847
PATRICIA BRAN NON.

03:41.880 --> 03:45.384
B-R-A-N-N-O-N.

03:45.420 --> 03:47.012
MS. BRANNON,
OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS,

03:47.060 --> 03:48.857
HAVE YOU NOTICED ANYONE
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD

03:48.890 --> 03:51.450
WHO LOOKED, UH,
LIKE HE DIDN'T BELONG?

03:51.490 --> 03:53.856
NOT THAT I RECALL.

03:53.900 --> 03:57.768
MAYBE A SUSPICIOUS
LOOKING VEHICLE
PARKED ON THE STREET?

03:57.800 --> 03:59.438
NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT,

03:59.470 --> 04:01.995
THERE WAS A VAN PARKED
DOWN THE BLOCK
FOR THE LONGEST TIME.

04:02.040 --> 04:03.530
COULD THAT BE SOMETHING?

04:03.570 --> 04:05.936
DID YOU SEE A NAME
ON THE VAN?

04:07.780 --> 04:10.374
ALL-CITY CABLE.

04:13.550 --> 04:16.883
I'M SORRY, COULD I
GET YOU SOMETHING?

04:16.920 --> 04:18.888
WATER, COFFEE, LEMONADE?

04:18.920 --> 04:20.888
YEAH, YEAH,
WATER WOULD BE GREAT.

04:20.920 --> 04:22.888
SURE.

04:28.460 --> 04:30.963
[BREATHING HARD]

04:47.980 --> 04:50.778
[MUFFLED SCREAM]

04:50.820 --> 04:53.812
[GRUNTING]

05:02.830 --> 05:03.967
UHH!

05:39.070 --> 05:41.038
Morgan:
"THE DARKNESS ALWAYS LIES."

05:41.070 --> 05:43.607
ANTHONY LICCIONE.

05:43.640 --> 05:46.029
WELL, IT DOESN'T APPEAR
THE UNSUB HAS
A PARTICULAR TYPE.

05:46.070 --> 05:47.776
GERTRUDE WAS 29 AND BLOND.

05:47.810 --> 05:49.300
ISABELLA WAS 40
AND BRUNE'I'I'E.

05:49.340 --> 05:52.047
AND GARCIA FOUND NO PERSONAL
CONNECTION BETWEEN CONNECTION
BETWEEN THE VICTIMS.

05:52.080 --> 05:53.513
BOTH LED LOW-RISK
LIFESTYLES.

05:53.550 --> 05:55.939
ISABELLA WORKED FROM HOME
DOING MEDICAL BILLING.

05:55.980 --> 05:58.687
GERTRUDE WAS A MARKETING
EXEC FOR A TOY COMPANY.

05:58.720 --> 06:01.450
BOTH VICTIMS WERE ALSO
HOME ALONE DURING THE DAY
WHEN THEY LET HIM IN.

06:01.490 --> 06:03.048
RATHER THAN TYPE,
IT MAY HAVE BEEN
THE WOMEN'S CIRCUMSTANCES

06:03.090 --> 06:04.421
THAT WERE IMPORTANT TO HIM.

06:04.460 --> 06:05.529
YOU KNOW, THE WRAPPING
OF THE VICTIMS

06:05.560 --> 06:07.425
AND THE FACT THAT
THEY WERE BOTH FOUND
IN THE BEDROOM

06:07.460 --> 06:09.428
COULD INDICATE SOME SORT
OF SEXUAL OR POWER
DOMINANCE FETISH,

06:09.470 --> 06:10.767
LIKE CLAUSTROPHILIA.

06:10.800 --> 06:12.438
BUT DON'T MOST
CLAUSTROPHILIACS

06:12.470 --> 06:13.732
WANT TO EXPERIENCE TI
FOR THEMSELVES?

06:13.770 --> 06:14.862
WELL, IF THE UNSUB
WAS INTO THAT,

06:14.900 --> 06:17.437
HE COULD BE PROJECTING
HIS OWN FETISH
ONTO HIS VICTIMS.

06:17.470 --> 06:19.472
SIR, THE L.A. DIVISION
JUST REACHED OUT.

06:19.510 --> 06:20.704
THERE'S BEEN ANOTHER
WOMAN FOUND DEAD,

06:20.740 --> 06:23.573
WRAPPED HEAD TO TOE
IN A BEDSHEET,
THIS TIME IN HER KITCHEN.

06:23.610 --> 06:25.407
3 VICTIMS IN TWO DAYS.

06:25.450 --> 06:28.647
AS PREDICT ED, WE OFFICIALLY
HAVE A SPREE KILLER
ON OUR HANDS.

06:28.680 --> 06:31.114
AND OFFICIALLY THE LAPD
HAS HANDED OVER
THE INVESTIGATION.

06:31.150 --> 06:34.051
THE MOTIVATION FOR
SPREE KILLERS IS TYPICALLY
PERSONAL AND RETALIATORY

06:34.090 --> 06:35.557
WITH AN ULTIMATE GOAL
IN MIND.

06:35.590 --> 06:37.023
CHRISTOPHER DORNER'S
MOTIVATION WAS PAYBACK

06:37.060 --> 06:38.948
FOR BEING FIRED
BY THE LAPD.

06:38.990 --> 06:41.094
HE SET OUT TO MURDER
COPS AND THEIR FAMILIES.

06:41.130 --> 06:43.621
HE KILLED A POLICE OFFICER
AND A SHERIFF'S DEPUTY,

06:43.670 --> 06:45.626
AFTER KILLING TWO FAMILY
MEMBERS OF ANOTHER COP.

06:45.670 --> 06:48.491
SO WHAT'S DRIVING
OUR UNSUB? AND WHY NOW?

06:48.540 --> 06:49.962
THE ANSWER'S
IN HIS BEHAVIOR.

06:50.010 --> 06:52.137
GARCIA, LET AGENT COLFAX
KNOW WE'RE ON THE WAY.

06:52.170 --> 06:53.603
YES, SIR.
DAVE, WHEN WE LAND,
YOU AND MORGAN

06:53.640 --> 06:55.676
GO TO THE LATEST
CRIME SCENE.

06:55.710 --> 06:59.544
REID, YOU GO THE THE ME,
AND J] AND I WILL GET
SET UP AT THE FIELD OFFICE.

07:04.890 --> 07:06.755
NATALIE.
AARON HOTCHNER.

07:06.790 --> 07:07.984
I DIDN'T THINK YOU'D BE
BACK HERE SO SOON.

07:08.020 --> 07:09.851
NEITHER DID WE.
THIS IS AGENT JAREAU.

07:09.890 --> 07:10.720
HEY. WELCOME.

07:10.760 --> 07:12.625
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT
THE LATEST VICTIM?

07:12.660 --> 07:13.797
PATRICIA BRAN NON.

07:13.830 --> 07:16.219
48. LIVED ALONE
IN SILVERLAKE.

07:16.260 --> 07:18.763
SHE WORKED NIGHTS
AT AN ANIMAL HOSPITAL
AS A VETERINARY TECH.

07:18.800 --> 07:19.767
WHO FOUND HER?

07:19.800 --> 07:20.960
SUPER IN HER
APARTMENT COMPLEX.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.661
CAME BY TO FIX A LEAK.

07:22.710 --> 07:25.008
THE FIRST TWO VICTIMS
LIVED IN PRIVATE HOMES.

07:25.040 --> 07:26.974
YEAH, IT'S A BOLD MOVE
TO KILL IN AN APARTMENT COMPLEX.

07:27.010 --> 07:28.637
EASIER TO BE SEEN
OR HEARD BY NEIGHBORS.

07:28.680 --> 07:30.671
HE'LL KEEP TAKING
GREATER RISKS.

07:30.710 --> 07:32.849
HE NEEDS TO SURPASS
THE RUSH OF THE LAST KILL.

07:32.880 --> 07:34.575
I HAD MY PEOPLE
PULL THE CRIMINAL RECORDS

07:34.620 --> 07:37.145
OF MEN IN LA. WITH
M.O.s INVOLVING BONDAGE.

07:37.190 --> 07:38.646
ANY POTENTIAL CANDIDATES
WHO COULD BE OUR UNSUB?

07:38.690 --> 07:40.783
YEAH. 3 HAD RELEVANT PRIORS.

07:40.820 --> 07:41.787
AND WHERE ARE THEY?

07:41.820 --> 07:43.526
I PICKED UP TWO OF THEM
BUT HAD TO LET THEM GO.

07:43.560 --> 07:44.982
AND THE THIRD?
ALIBIS CHECKED OUT.

07:45.030 --> 07:47.089
WILLIAM SNYDER.
HISTORY OF B&E

07:47.130 --> 07:48.995
AND SEXUAL VIOLENCE
AGAINST WOMEN.

07:49.030 --> 07:51.794
HE'S STILL IN THE WIND.

07:51.830 --> 07:54.833
Morgan: SO HOW DID HE KNOW
WHICH APARTMENT TO GO TO?

07:54.870 --> 07:57.907
HE MUST FOLLOW THEM.
THEIR PARKING SPACES

07:57.940 --> 08:00.807
AND MAILBOXES MAY BE MARKED.

08:00.840 --> 08:03.775
WELL, THERE'S NO SECURITY
GUARDS TO ANNOUNCE VISITORS.

08:03.810 --> 08:06.847
THE BUZZER PANELS HAS NAMES
AND APARTMENT NUMBERS ON IT.

08:06.880 --> 08:09.940
WELL, LET'S JUST HOPE
THOSE WORK.

08:12.320 --> 08:17.121
HE COULD HAVE JUST
PUSHED ALL THE BUTTONS,
HOPE SOMEBODY LET HIM IN.

08:17.160 --> 08:19.799
OR...

08:19.830 --> 08:22.993
HE JUST WALKED RIGHT IN.

08:24.300 --> 08:25.961
Rossi: THANKS AGAIN, MA'AM,
FOR YOUR TIME.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.729
Woman: OF COURSE.

08:30.170 --> 08:33.207
WELL, THIS COMPLEX
IS PRETTY SMALL.

08:33.240 --> 08:35.708
AND ALL THE FRONT DOORS
FACE THE COURTYARD,

08:35.740 --> 08:37.207
YET NOBODY HEARD
OR SAW ANYTHING

08:37.250 --> 08:39.104
WHEN PATRICIA BRANNON
WAS KILLED.

08:39.150 --> 08:41.141
IT MEANS HE'S ORGANIZED,
CRIMINALLY SOPHISTICATED,

08:41.180 --> 08:45.116
NO AMATEUR.
HE GETS IN AND OUT
WITHOUT DETECTION.

08:45.150 --> 08:47.584
WE SHOULD SEND
THE CAMERA FOOTAGE

08:47.620 --> 08:49.315
BACK TO THE OFFICE
SO HOTCH CAN REVIEW IT.

08:49.360 --> 08:52.750
HEY, THIS MIGHT BE
OUR LUCKY DAY.

08:55.830 --> 08:59.129
WHEN WE UNWRAPPED THE VICTIM
I NOTED OBVIOUS SIGNS
OF ASPHYXIA.

08:59.170 --> 09:02.901
PETECHIAL HEMORRHAGE,
CYANOSIS IN THE NAIL BEDS.
PRETTY CLEAR THAT'S THE C.O.D.

09:02.940 --> 09:05.158
MM-HMM.
SHE WAS WRAPPED IN THIS?

09:06.780 --> 09:09.601
LOOK, BITE MARKS.
SHE ATTEMPTED TO CHEW
THROUGH THE MATERIAL

09:09.650 --> 09:11.777
TO GET SOME AIR,
WHICH MEANS SHE WAS
WRAPPED PREMORTEM.

09:11.810 --> 09:13.243
YES, LIKE THE OTHER VICTIMS.

09:13.280 --> 09:15.248
THERE WAS ALSO A TEAR
IN THE UPPER FRENULUM.

09:15.280 --> 09:17.089
THE SKIN AROUND
HER NOSE AND MOUTH
APPEARS WHITE,

09:17.120 --> 09:19.247
SO HE MUST HAVE PRESSED
DOWN WITH HIS HAND
TO SMOTHER HER.

09:19.290 --> 09:20.689
ANY SIGN OF SEXUAL ASSAULT?

09:20.720 --> 09:22.256
NONE. SAME AS THE FIRST TWO.

09:22.290 --> 09:24.758
SO, SMOTHERING IS EITHER
HIS M.O. OR HIS RITUAL.

09:24.790 --> 09:25.984
WHAT KIND OF RITUAL?

09:26.030 --> 09:28.897
RIGHT NOW ONLY HE KNOWS.

09:31.170 --> 09:34.765
HEY. DID YOU TRACK DOWN
THAT SEX OFFENDER
WILLIAM SNYDER YET?

09:34.800 --> 09:36.267
YEAH, IT'S A DEAD END.

09:36.300 --> 09:37.301
HOW SO?

09:37.340 --> 09:40.104
HIGHWAY PATROL LOCKED HIM UP
48 HOURS AGO FOR DUI.

09:40.140 --> 09:41.778
CASE JUST HIT THE SYSTEM.

09:41.810 --> 09:43.778
[TEXT MESSAGE TONE]

09:43.810 --> 09:47.644
THE SECURITY FOOTAGE
ON PATRICIA BRANNON'S
APARTMENT COMPLEX IS UP.

09:51.420 --> 09:53.012
THAT MUST BE HIM.

09:53.060 --> 09:56.359
JJ: HE'S DRESSED LIKE
A PROFESSIONAL.

09:56.390 --> 09:58.824
WE PUT A HEIGHT SCALE
OVERLAY ON THE IMAGE,

09:58.860 --> 10:00.999

CRIME-MAPPING DATA,

THERE WAS A HOMICIDE

23:09.750 --> 23:12.184
OR A RAPE OF A FEMALE
WITHIN A TWO-BLOCK RADIUS.

23:12.220 --> 23:13.915
WHEN DID THOSE OTHER

POLICE RADIO

23:21.130 --> 23:23.496
OR A SCANNER APP
ON HIS PHONE.

23:23.530 --> 23:26.522
SO HE LISTENS FOR REPORTS
OF SEXUAL ASSAULT OR MURDER

AND THEN TROLLS THOSE AREAS

CREATED BY OTHER CRIMINALS
OPERATING NEARBY.

23:36.910 --> 23:39.708

HIS VICTIMS TO LET HIM IN
