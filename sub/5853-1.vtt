01:09.235 --> 01:10.463
The ball is behind him.

01:10.503 --> 01:13.199
He bobbles it,
and still controls it and scores.

01:13.239 --> 01:16.208
What a remarkable goal
for Cristiano Ronaldo,

01:16.242 --> 01:18.642
- one of the world's best.
- So...

01:18.678 --> 01:20.543
who are we rooting for?

01:20.580 --> 01:24.641
The man is awesome, Mom,
but Portugal is the best.

01:26.152 --> 01:28.746
I'll do anything
to play like him, Mom.

01:28.788 --> 01:31.382
Well, you know, you got to learn
to walk before you can jump.

01:31.424 --> 01:33.722
...he still controls it and scores.

01:33.760 --> 01:36.593
You got to be real good if you
want to be on a national team.

01:36.629 --> 01:39.257
You got to work real hard.

01:39.299 --> 01:41.267
And...

01:41.301 --> 01:44.793
you got to prove yourself to the coach
so he gives you more play time.

01:46.906 --> 01:48.897
I don't want to be
a ball boy anymore, Mom.

01:48.942 --> 01:52.207
I want to play
for the national team.

01:52.245 --> 01:55.009
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

01:55.048 --> 01:57.573
- Is that what you really want?
- Mm-hmm

01:57.617 --> 01:59.983
You feel it here?

02:02.622 --> 02:04.249
I feel it here.

02:05.725 --> 02:07.852
Well, you can be anything
you want to be.

02:10.130 --> 02:11.392
We believe in you.

02:13.867 --> 02:15.698
Ah, come here.

02:15.735 --> 02:17.999
- I love you, Mom.
- Aw.

02:20.039 --> 02:21.631
I love you too, peanut.

02:23.676 --> 02:26.304
Okay.
Finish your sandwich.

02:34.220 --> 02:36.085
Goal!

02:36.122 --> 02:39.649
- Whoo!
- Who scored?

02:39.692 --> 02:43.685
This guy Cristiano Ronaldo
is the best player in the world.

02:43.730 --> 02:45.823
Oh, my gosh,
you should see it.

02:45.865 --> 02:47.730
Well, they're gonna show
the instant replay right now.

02:47.767 --> 02:50.292
No, no, no, no.
I got this.

02:59.145 --> 03:00.578
- Again?
- Oh, wow.

03:00.613 --> 03:02.478
Mom, see that?

03:02.515 --> 03:05.075
Man, that's how I'd want to score
in a finals game.

03:05.118 --> 03:07.052
Wasn't that just amazing?

03:07.086 --> 03:08.576
Uh, yes.

03:08.621 --> 03:10.612
- Wow!
- Amazing.

03:10.657 --> 03:12.921
I hope I don't get in trouble.

03:12.959 --> 03:14.950
You said you believed in me.

03:14.994 --> 03:17.622
Go get your ball.

03:21.367 --> 03:23.392
A new ball.

03:25.939 --> 03:28.601
Finders keepers,
losers weepers.

03:28.641 --> 03:30.802
All right, guys,
go get ready.

03:30.843 --> 03:32.902
We got a new ball.

03:32.946 --> 03:34.573
Hi, Mr. Granger.

03:34.614 --> 03:36.946
Well, if it isn't
Chris the wannabe.

03:36.983 --> 03:38.678
Can I have
my ball back, please?

03:38.718 --> 03:40.618
What ball is that?

03:40.653 --> 03:44.350
So, where's your dad?
On some secret mission?

03:44.390 --> 03:46.221
- Hi, Kathleen.
- Hey, Frank.

03:46.259 --> 03:48.454
- Nice day, huh?
- Yeah, it's very.

03:48.494 --> 03:50.257
Have you watered
your tulips today?

03:50.296 --> 03:53.959
Well, my work schedule's been
interfering with my gardening.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.661
How's George?

03:58.605 --> 04:02.268
You know what this country needs
is heroes at home, too.

04:02.308 --> 04:03.639
To lift up our spirits,

04:03.676 --> 04:06.509
to stand by those who have
to stay home alone, right?

04:06.546 --> 04:09.379
Yeah, well,
this is my hero right here.

04:09.415 --> 04:11.542
Right.

04:11.584 --> 04:13.313
Did you find it, hmm?

04:13.353 --> 04:15.787
What'd you lose?
Has Chris been naughty again?

04:15.822 --> 04:18.346
Well, you know,
boys will be boys.

04:18.391 --> 04:20.450
Tell me about it.
Ed and Donald do the same thing.

04:20.493 --> 04:22.654
They practice in the house
and break things.

04:22.695 --> 04:25.789
But they made the team of course.
Northern Stars.

04:25.832 --> 04:28.198
And, as you know,
not an easy team to make.

04:28.234 --> 04:30.134
Yes, I do know.
Your boys are very good.

04:30.169 --> 04:32.000
Ah, the best.

04:32.038 --> 04:35.064
Look, Kathleen,
if you need a man's man around,

04:35.108 --> 04:37.303
you know, to keep him in line
and to fix things around the house,

04:37.343 --> 04:39.709
do not hesitate, call me.

04:41.781 --> 04:43.078
Okay.

04:45.251 --> 04:46.309
Oh, uh, Frank?

04:46.352 --> 04:47.717
Yes, Kathleen?

04:47.754 --> 04:50.314
Could you take Christian
to practice today?

04:50.356 --> 04:51.687
I've got to be at work again.

04:51.724 --> 04:53.351
I would love to.

04:53.393 --> 04:54.826
That'd be great.
Thank you.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.865
I don't want to be in his car!

05:04.704 --> 05:06.535
And I don't like
when he calls me Chris.

05:06.572 --> 05:09.097
I think you're being
a little hard on him.

05:09.142 --> 05:12.873
Hi, this is Kathleen Larou.
Yes, I do.

05:12.912 --> 05:14.937
The window guy's
going to be be annoyed.

05:14.981 --> 05:18.508
He's never annoyed, honey.
Ye.

05:21.087 --> 05:22.418
He's annoyed.

05:22.455 --> 05:24.218
Told you.

05:24.257 --> 05:26.623
Can you come by
later this afternoon?

05:26.659 --> 05:29.822
Great. All right,
we'll see you then. Thanks.

05:32.732 --> 05:34.427
All right.

05:34.467 --> 05:35.991
Hey.

05:40.773 --> 05:42.001
Peanut?

05:42.041 --> 05:43.872
I miss Dad.

05:43.910 --> 05:45.935
Oh, me, too, honey.

05:49.148 --> 05:51.116
When can he watch me play?

05:54.387 --> 05:55.547
Soon, honey.

05:57.724 --> 05:58.986
Soon.

06:04.630 --> 06:07.963
Portugal won because
of Cristiano Ronaldo.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.900
Two goals!

06:09.936 --> 06:13.963
And I could have scored more,
just like how I beat you at Xbox.

06:16.876 --> 06:19.401
What do you think, Chris?
You think he's that good?

06:19.445 --> 06:21.379
Yeah, go on.

06:21.414 --> 06:23.143
Ball boy.

06:23.182 --> 06:25.275
He uses both feet.
That's why he's good.

06:25.318 --> 06:28.913
Plays on both wings, too.
Doesn't run the wrong way.

06:28.955 --> 06:30.889
He's never missed
a penalty kick.

06:30.923 --> 06:34.290
He can curve the ball from a dead
position into both directions.

06:34.327 --> 06:37.319
Got a long way to go before
you're that good, huh, kid?

06:39.365 --> 06:41.799
Mom said I can
be anything if I want to.

06:41.834 --> 06:43.859
Mama's boy.

06:43.903 --> 06:46.167
Mama's boy.

06:48.274 --> 06:50.868
Okay, kids,
let's go play soccer.

06:50.910 --> 06:52.400
Hurry up, let's go.

06:58.918 --> 07:01.512
Come on, guys.
Hustle up! You're late!

07:01.554 --> 07:03.351
Here's your ball, ball boy.

07:10.229 --> 07:11.787
Dominic!

07:11.831 --> 07:13.059
Hey!

07:15.034 --> 07:18.128
Tight on the cones, guys.
Control!

07:22.875 --> 07:24.570
Nice.

07:24.610 --> 07:27.272
Good, good!
Keep up the pace!

07:27.313 --> 07:28.405
Keep it up!

07:32.251 --> 07:34.947
You got to be joking!

07:34.987 --> 07:37.319
Julian, this is not
a nap session.

07:37.356 --> 07:40.018
- Do you mind joining us?
- Bring it on.

07:43.229 --> 07:45.891
Call that a shot?

07:45.932 --> 07:48.526
Good! Bring it out!

07:48.568 --> 07:51.298
For our next game, I'm looking
to change up our strategy.

07:51.337 --> 07:52.736
I just wish we could.

07:52.772 --> 07:55.400
Yeah, make sure you're playing
my sons then, okay?

07:55.441 --> 07:58.171
If we want to compete
in the state championships,

07:58.211 --> 08:00.577
I have to change up
the strategy, Frank.

08:00.613 --> 08:02.205
Yeah?

08:02.248 --> 08:05.308
- Something is missing.

08:05.351 --> 08:08.218
Josh, pass it right away!

08:08.254 --> 08:10.745
Well, Coach, maybe the passing
is what's missing.

08:10.790 --> 08:13.350
- Ah, I need a poacher.
- A what?

08:13.392 --> 08:15.257
A striker with instincts.

08:15.294 --> 08:16.955
Mm-hmm. Hmm.

08:16.996 --> 08:19.430
Chris, go get the balls, will you?

08:19.465 --> 08:22.593
Donald, sit this one out.
I'm gonna let Christian have a go.

08:23.603 --> 08:27.164
Well, Chris has hardly been making
it to practice, Coach.

08:27.206 --> 08:29.367
His father's in the military.
He's got a working mom.

08:29.408 --> 08:31.137
I want to see if I can't place him
in the team.

08:31.177 --> 08:33.236
- All right.
- And it's my decision.

08:33.279 --> 08:35.474
- It is your decision.
- Hey, Christian.

08:38.918 --> 08:41.113
Take Donald's place
and impress me.

08:42.822 --> 08:44.414
Heads up, Frank.

08:44.457 --> 08:47.358
- All right, here we go!
- Yeah, come on, Christian.

08:47.393 --> 08:49.361
- Show what what you got.
- Form a triangle!

08:49.395 --> 08:51.955
Triangle!
Tri, Josh!

08:51.998 --> 08:53.556
That Josh is a lazy kid.

08:56.869 --> 08:58.029
Protect your goal!

09:22.929 --> 09:24.396
All right, come on.

09:26.198 --> 09:28.291
Time for bed.
Lay down.

09:33.873 --> 09:36.899
You're awfully quiet today.
Is everything all right?

09:36.943 --> 09:39.173
Huh?
Practice a bore?

09:44.483 --> 09:45.848
Did you miss a chance to play?

09:47.787 --> 09:50.347
- I played.
- You played?

09:50.389 --> 09:53.290
That's wonderful.
Why didn't you tell me?

09:55.061 --> 09:56.460
But I didn't score.

09:56.495 --> 09:58.463
Oh, honey.

09:58.497 --> 10:00.522
That's okay.

10:02.902 --> 10:05.928
Dad always says, "Never quit
and always try your best."

10:05.972 --> 10:09.135
"And a different day
will bring its own blessing."

10:09.175 --> 10:11.006
That's right.

10:13.879 --> 10:16.006
- Mom?
- Yes.

10:16.048 --> 10:17.913
Why do people hate?

10:17.950 --> 10:21.477
People who hate just haven't gotten
rid of all the bad inside of them.

10:24.957 --> 10:28.358
Hey, what does Dad say when, uh...
when things aren't right?

10:31.897 --> 10:35.628
"Never give up, for it brings success,
and that's the best revenge."

10:35.668 --> 10:38.034
That's right.

10:39.572 --> 10:42.632
Success is the best revenge.

10:46.445 --> 10:48.276
I miss Dad.

10:48.314 --> 10:50.145
Oh, honey.

10:52.284 --> 10:53.751
Me, too.

10:55.588 --> 10:56.748
Me, too.

11:24.884 --> 11:26.511
Stay heavy on the flank.

11:29.088 --> 11:30.646
- Rogers!
- I got you.

11:30.690 --> 11:32.954
- Keep it down.
- How can we keep it down?

11:32.992 --> 11:35.688
Our boys have no idea
where we're at.

11:35.728 --> 11:38.788
Make sure we get that
transmission working again.

11:38.831 --> 11:41.925
Yes, sir. I'm working on that.
James, get those communications up!

11:41.967 --> 11:46.700
I got, I got to make a decision
and you can't argue with me.

11:46.739 --> 11:48.400
Now listen up!

11:48.441 --> 11:51.933
We're surrounded
and our ammo's low.

11:51.977 --> 11:53.842
I can't slow you down
and risk your lives.

11:53.879 --> 11:55.779
Sir, if I could say something,

11:55.815 --> 11:59.182
there's no way in hell
we're leaving you behind, no way.

11:59.218 --> 12:01.209
If you don't do what I say,
you'll never get out of here.

12:01.253 --> 12:03.312
James, get those
communications up!

12:03.355 --> 12:05.380
Incoming!

12:10.696 --> 12:13.187
All right,
just let me lumber up.

12:14.734 --> 12:17.703
That hurt. Okay.

12:27.480 --> 12:30.938
Almost ready.
Hold your horses.

12:30.983 --> 12:33.008
- I don't have all day!
- I'm almost done.

12:33.052 --> 12:36.317
Just let me stretch my hips.

12:36.355 --> 12:38.653
Okay.

12:38.691 --> 12:40.249
Here we go.

12:40.292 --> 12:41.953
And...

12:41.994 --> 12:44.326
Okay.

12:44.363 --> 12:46.854
Oh, oh, okay.
All right.

12:51.837 --> 12:53.668
Are you serious?

12:53.706 --> 12:55.765
- Mmm.
- You're killing me.

12:55.808 --> 12:58.834
I can't help it.
Chocolate is my weakness.

12:58.878 --> 13:00.641
Kind of like...

13:00.679 --> 13:02.579
kids who watch
the Teletubbies.

13:02.615 --> 13:03.741
Does your mom know?

13:03.783 --> 13:07.310
You're not gonna tell,
are you?

13:07.353 --> 13:09.218
If I score, I get a bar.

13:09.255 --> 13:11.655
- You sound like my mom.
- Let me see them.

13:22.501 --> 13:25.129
Bellisima!

13:25.171 --> 13:27.901
- You're killing me!
- You said that already.

13:27.940 --> 13:31.171
Okay.
Let's get it on.

13:31.210 --> 13:32.370
Okay.

13:33.712 --> 13:36.943
See why they call me
the goalie.

13:36.982 --> 13:40.850
Pretty intense and awesome.
All the ladies love it.

13:40.886 --> 13:44.754
If the ladies count as my mom,
but still, they love it.

13:44.790 --> 13:48.055
All right! I'm ready.

13:51.964 --> 13:53.522
One bar for me.

13:53.566 --> 13:55.727
How do you expect
to fly for the ball

13:55.768 --> 13:58.236
when you eat sweets
like you drink water?

13:58.270 --> 14:00.431
Can you just hit
the ball, please?

14:06.946 --> 14:08.607
Not again!

14:08.647 --> 14:10.114
Um...

14:10.149 --> 14:12.413
yeah, I'm outta here
with my bars.

14:19.124 --> 14:21.684
Oh, it's you again, is it?

14:21.727 --> 14:25.219
The kid that just loves
to play football!

14:25.264 --> 14:26.754
I'm sorry, sir.

14:26.799 --> 14:29.324
Well, you should be sorry!

14:29.368 --> 14:32.633
Who gives you the right to disturb
my afternoon nap, eh?

14:32.671 --> 14:35.936
Oh, no,
just look at this mess.

14:35.975 --> 14:37.909
The lilacs, the tulips.

14:37.943 --> 14:40.810
Oh, not the pansies.

14:40.846 --> 14:43.610
And you just stand there
as if everything's all right!

14:43.649 --> 14:46.174
- I...
- Oh, now he's got a sorry face on!

14:46.218 --> 14:48.015
- I...
- Well, that's just wonderful!

14:48.053 --> 14:52.149
Look, I love my plants!
I like watering them!

14:52.191 --> 14:54.091
I like taking care of them!

14:54.126 --> 14:58.893
Well, at least the fuchsia
has survived.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.434
Look, I beg you, please,

15:03.469 --> 15:07.200
keep away from my plants!

15:07.239 --> 15:11.005
Especially the pansies.
You get it?

15:11.043 --> 15:14.843
I'll make sure I never mess
with your pansies

15:14.880 --> 15:18.213
and your tulips, and your...

15:18.250 --> 15:20.616
Fuchsia! Fuchsia!

15:20.653 --> 15:24.020
Sure. Them, too.
Good-bye.

15:32.798 --> 15:35.130
Come on, Stars,
pull yourselves!

15:35.167 --> 15:36.759
Fight back!

15:40.005 --> 15:41.905
- See, you've got to get back.
- Josh! Get back!

15:41.941 --> 15:43.841
Keep it moving!
Defense!

15:43.876 --> 15:46.640
Pull yourselves together!
Pull yourselves!

15:49.515 --> 15:52.177
All the way in!
All the way! Mark!

15:53.319 --> 15:55.844
Get that ball.
Get that ball!

15:57.056 --> 15:59.616
Agh!

16:01.927 --> 16:04.293
Lucky!

16:04.330 --> 16:07.231
Ah, they'll be fine.

16:07.266 --> 16:09.097
Are you kidding me?

16:09.134 --> 16:11.295
Josh, get back!
Keep it ready.

16:11.337 --> 16:13.168
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

16:14.840 --> 16:17.775
Hey!
[SHOUTS in foreign language]

16:19.945 --> 16:22.175
He tripped my son.
Kick him out.

16:23.916 --> 16:25.213
All right, guys, bring it in!

16:27.453 --> 16:29.512
Grab some bench.

16:32.758 --> 16:34.385
Listen up, guys.

16:34.426 --> 16:36.121
What happened
to the triangle passing?

16:36.161 --> 16:37.822
Heads up, guys.

16:37.863 --> 16:41.731
Short passes, look for the breaks,
and get into the forwards.

16:41.767 --> 16:44.736
And then we can score.
We could tie this.

16:44.770 --> 16:48.501
And if we tie, we have a chance
to be in the top two.

16:48.540 --> 16:51.703
You can either be my champions
or you can be forgotten.

16:51.744 --> 16:53.609
What's it gonna be?

16:55.080 --> 16:56.638
What'll it be?

16:56.682 --> 16:58.411
- Champions!
- There we go!

16:58.450 --> 17:00.714
Christian's got it.
Who else?

17:00.753 --> 17:03.221
- I do.
- I love it!

17:03.255 --> 17:05.246
I'm hungry.

17:07.492 --> 17:08.983
What are we?

17:09.028 --> 17:10.358
Champions!

17:10.396 --> 17:12.921
I'm sorry,
I couldn't hear you guys.

17:12.964 --> 17:14.898
- What are we?
- Champions!

17:14.933 --> 17:18.096
Yes!
Get out there and play some ball!

17:18.137 --> 17:20.070
- But I'm still hungry.
- Oh, please.

17:20.105 --> 17:22.403
I'll get you a snack later.

17:38.357 --> 17:39.756
Hustle!

17:51.970 --> 17:53.597
Fight back!

17:57.176 --> 17:58.871
Penalty!

17:58.911 --> 18:01.175
Good call!

18:01.213 --> 18:02.976
Okay, Steve, you take this!

18:13.692 --> 18:15.819
Yeah!

18:15.861 --> 18:17.829
That's what I'm talking about!

18:17.863 --> 18:20.195
- Yeah!
- That's what he's talking about!

18:27.005 --> 18:29.439
Come on, come on!

18:38.917 --> 18:41.784
I'm gonna be frank, Frank.
Christian is one of our forwards.

18:41.820 --> 18:44.948
And he's gonna get play time.
What is your beef with him, anyway?

18:44.990 --> 18:46.651
I just want to win, like you.

18:46.692 --> 18:48.523
It's a risk if you put him in,
that's all.

18:48.560 --> 18:51.552
- And I'm the coach.
- Yes, you are the coach.

18:51.597 --> 18:53.622
Hey, Christian.

18:55.267 --> 18:57.201
Tell me why you think
I should put you in.

18:57.236 --> 18:59.898
I want to show my dad
there's a reason to come home.

18:59.938 --> 19:03.635
All right, you got three minutes.
Donald!

19:08.847 --> 19:11.247
That's my boy, Christian.

19:11.283 --> 19:12.944
Good game, Donald.

19:26.965 --> 19:28.523
- Man.
- That was close.

19:30.035 --> 19:32.765
It's all right, guys!
Bring it back!

19:32.804 --> 19:36.035
Short passes!
Good effort!

19:50.322 --> 19:51.789
- Agh!

19:55.594 --> 19:58.188
Yeah!
That's what I'm talking about!

20:01.934 --> 20:04.698
- Yes!
- Great!

20:04.736 --> 20:06.863
Yes! Good job, guys.
Fantastic.

20:06.905 --> 20:08.930
We're still in the race.

20:14.346 --> 20:16.143
- You did well.
- Yeah.

20:16.181 --> 20:18.376
And I only had
two bars last night.

20:21.853 --> 20:23.650
See ya.

20:23.689 --> 20:27.489
Hey, that was a great shot.
You were just unlucky.

20:27.526 --> 20:29.551
You played like a champ.

20:29.595 --> 20:31.756
I agree.

20:31.797 --> 20:33.128
Hey, Kathleen,
how are you doing?

20:33.165 --> 20:35.497
I'm good, thanks.

20:35.534 --> 20:38.264
You ready?

20:38.303 --> 20:40.601
Hey, should I get take-out?

20:42.774 --> 20:44.799
He gives me the creeps.

20:46.011 --> 20:48.707
Hey, Dominic.
That's my neighbor.

20:48.747 --> 20:50.772
Army wife.

20:50.816 --> 20:52.579
Those Army wives, man.

20:52.618 --> 20:55.246
Lonely, and in divorce.

20:55.287 --> 20:58.381
It's that distance thing, you know?
They just can't handle it.

20:58.423 --> 21:01.392
So, so I'm good to her.

21:03.161 --> 21:04.594
I'll see you at practice, Frank.

21:04.630 --> 21:07.690
Yeah, Dominic.
See you there.

21:19.111 --> 21:20.738
Mom?

21:20.779 --> 21:22.940
Yeah, honey.

21:25.083 --> 21:27.517
It was sweet,
you watching the game.

21:27.552 --> 21:29.611
Aw, honey.

21:30.889 --> 21:34.188
I'm going to make sure
I'm at every one of them.

21:34.226 --> 21:36.353
I promise.

21:36.395 --> 21:37.521
You're a cool chick.

21:37.562 --> 21:40.690
Well, thank you.

21:40.732 --> 21:42.666
You know,
your dad used to say that to me.

21:48.807 --> 21:50.536
Can I sleep next to you?

21:58.050 --> 22:00.018
I wouldn't have it
any other way.

22:25.110 --> 22:27.510
Release the Spiders
and Dragonflies.

22:27.546 --> 22:29.275
Yes, sir.

22:35.454 --> 22:37.718
James, we're gonna make it.

22:37.756 --> 22:39.656
We're down to one magazine.

22:39.691 --> 22:43.457
We haven't eaten in days,
and I'm... .

22:43.495 --> 22:45.486
Soldier, you do your job
and I will get you home.

22:45.530 --> 22:47.930
- I promise you that.
- Yeah.

22:47.966 --> 22:49.991
Like him?

22:56.174 --> 22:58.335
Release the Spiders
and Dragonflies!

23:36.581 --> 23:38.811
I'll pick you up later?

23:38.850 --> 23:40.408
Have a good day.

23:43.288 --> 23:44.846
Bye, Mom.

24:04.810 --> 24:06.277
Hello. Hello.

24:06.311 --> 24:08.336
- Kathleen Larou?
- Yes.

24:08.380 --> 24:11.110
This is Sergeant William Scott
from the US Army.

24:11.149 --> 24:13.709
- We tried to reach you at home.
- Yes, yes, yes.

24:13.752 --> 24:16.915
Uh, I haven't heard
from him in months.

24:16.955 --> 24:20.550
I'm afraid he's MIA, MIA.

24:34.139 --> 24:36.130
Your parents left us
a contact person,

24:36.174 --> 24:38.438
just in case we couldn't
get a hold of them.

24:42.714 --> 24:44.545
Speaking of the devil.

24:51.990 --> 24:53.958
Where's Mom?

24:59.030 --> 25:01.863
Hold my hand, young man.
Sir, you can wait there!

25:06.271 --> 25:08.501
Now, you listen.

25:08.540 --> 25:10.838
You be strong for her, okay?

25:30.262 --> 25:31.923
Mom?

25:37.869 --> 25:39.803
Oh.

25:45.710 --> 25:47.541
Hi, peanut.

25:54.019 --> 25:56.112
Mommy's not gonna be able to...

25:58.089 --> 26:00.557
come and watch
you play for a while.

26:02.394 --> 26:03.986
Okay?

26:06.264 --> 26:08.129
I'm sorry.

26:10.435 --> 26:11.993
Come here.

26:19.144 --> 26:21.009
Shh.

26:21.046 --> 26:23.606
Everything's gonna be okay.

26:27.752 --> 26:30.482
I'm gonna send
an angel to watch you.

26:30.522 --> 26:32.615
Okay?

26:39.965 --> 26:41.432
Shh.

26:48.306 --> 26:50.604
Why don't you
get some rest?

26:50.642 --> 26:51.768
Thank you.

26:55.814 --> 26:57.975
Don't forget to say
your prayers, honey.

27:00.051 --> 27:02.451
Ah-ah.

27:02.487 --> 27:05.684
Anybody for chicken salad?

27:05.724 --> 27:08.522
She's gonna need time.
Lots.

27:08.560 --> 27:11.586
Grandparents are deceased.
He has no aunts.

27:11.630 --> 27:14.963
The only uncle has been living
in Japan for 15 years.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.490
Right.

27:18.737 --> 27:21.535
You are on the parents'
list of contacts.

27:21.573 --> 27:23.564
Catch my drift?

27:23.608 --> 27:25.803
Drift.
What drift?

27:30.348 --> 27:33.579
Christian is gonna be in your care
until things get better.

27:42.127 --> 27:45.995
I'll take you to get
a new pair of shoes,

27:46.031 --> 27:49.228
and we'll get your things
from your house tomorrow.

27:51.803 --> 27:53.361
I want Mom.

27:53.405 --> 27:56.431
I know you do.
I know you do.

27:59.978 --> 28:02.776
Well,

28:02.814 --> 28:05.510
let's go to bed, huh?

28:05.550 --> 28:08.212
Hand me your shoes.

28:08.253 --> 28:11.484
Here we go.
There we go.

28:11.523 --> 28:13.457
I love this old mattress.

28:16.928 --> 28:19.123
If you get scared or anything,
just call "Frank!"

28:19.164 --> 28:20.859
I'll come running, okay?

28:22.801 --> 28:24.063
Wow.

28:41.152 --> 28:42.813
This is fun.

28:42.854 --> 28:44.719
This soccer ball is huge.

28:44.756 --> 28:47.850
Wow.
Look at all these boots.

28:50.662 --> 28:52.323
- Can I help you, sir?
- Hey, how's it going?

28:52.363 --> 28:54.194
- Good. How you doing?
- Can I speak to you for a second?

28:54.232 --> 28:55.290
Sure.

28:55.333 --> 28:59.736
I'm looking for something on sale
or even free.

28:59.771 --> 29:02.535
Uh, these are all the brands
we have, sir.

29:02.574 --> 29:05.543
Anything you guys want to get rid of.
Think overstock.

29:05.577 --> 29:08.239
Think cheap.
Think giveaway.

29:08.279 --> 29:09.837
Could you let go
of my shirt, please?

29:09.881 --> 29:12.315
- Excuse me. Sorry.
- Thanks.

29:12.350 --> 29:14.682
Um...

29:14.719 --> 29:17.187
uh, isn't he your son?

29:17.222 --> 29:20.123
No, no, he is not my child.

29:22.560 --> 29:25.654
I may have just the right thing
for your not child.

29:25.697 --> 29:27.221
- Cool.
- Hey, it's your turn.

29:27.265 --> 29:29.563
I got it. I got it.

29:29.601 --> 29:32.001
You know, this dirty,
worthless pair

29:32.036 --> 29:34.504
that you clearly stated you wanted
came in by mistake.

29:34.539 --> 29:36.871
Somebody at the factory
must have switched them.

29:36.908 --> 29:38.273
Let's give it a try.

29:38.309 --> 29:40.436
I didn't say anything
about dirty or worthless.

29:40.478 --> 29:42.241
Just affordable.

29:42.280 --> 29:43.542
Let's give them a try.

29:45.517 --> 29:46.745
There you go.

29:52.190 --> 29:53.714
Seriously?

29:55.360 --> 29:58.227
I know they're a little odd-looking,
but just give them a try.

30:10.074 --> 30:12.235
Thank you
for giving them to me, sir.

30:14.712 --> 30:16.805
I wish I had a better pair
for you, kid, I really do,

30:16.848 --> 30:18.179
but you're welcome, okay?

30:30.595 --> 30:32.927
Pass it. Pass it.

30:35.934 --> 30:36.958
Pass the ball!

30:38.636 --> 30:40.228
Darn.

30:45.810 --> 30:48.142
Quick one-two, guys!
Quick!

30:50.582 --> 30:51.913
Hey, nice shoes, kid.

30:56.221 --> 30:58.382
I heard about
what happened to your mom.

30:58.423 --> 31:00.653
And I want you to know
that I'm here for you, okay?

31:00.692 --> 31:04.321
All right? That doesn't mean
you get a free pass.

31:04.362 --> 31:08.230
You still have to prove to me
and to yourself that you can do it.

31:10.034 --> 31:14.061
Now, get out there and show everyone
what Christian Larou is made of.

31:14.105 --> 31:16.505
All right? Ed!

31:18.543 --> 31:21.535
Hey, look, pal, I sponsored this team
the past three years.

31:21.579 --> 31:24.173
- And I'm gonna pay you back, Frank.
- Well, I guess.

31:24.215 --> 31:27.309
You keep playing him,
I want my money back.

31:27.352 --> 31:30.253
Well, I guess I'll have to pay
you back then.

31:33.124 --> 31:34.887
Now to Christian!

31:45.103 --> 31:47.503
Sweet mama!
That's what I'm talking about!

31:47.538 --> 31:49.301
That just happened!

31:57.382 --> 31:59.646
- You all right there, Frank?
- Oh, yeah, what a shock.

31:59.684 --> 32:01.481
- That was a shock.

32:01.519 --> 32:03.453
All right, guys, bring it in!

32:03.488 --> 32:05.979
I heard about your mom.

32:06.024 --> 32:07.855
Don't worry, she'll be okay.

32:16.768 --> 32:19.635
- Don't be late, kid.
- Okay, Mr. Granger!

32:27.345 --> 32:28.869
Huh?

32:31.849 --> 32:33.214
Really.

32:43.261 --> 32:45.024
Charlie, we are under attack.

32:45.063 --> 32:46.223
Wow.

32:46.264 --> 32:48.198
He's tricking us!

32:48.232 --> 32:50.097
Stay, Charlie, stay.

32:58.576 --> 33:00.874
Here it comes!
Be brave!

33:00.912 --> 33:03.403
- Ah!

33:03.448 --> 33:04.574
Wow.

33:18.396 --> 33:20.023
You okay, sir?

33:20.064 --> 33:22.225
What the devil is going on?

33:22.266 --> 33:23.563
Practicing.

33:23.601 --> 33:25.660
How are your...

33:25.703 --> 33:27.102
Fuchsias?

33:27.138 --> 33:29.129
They are, uh...

33:29.173 --> 33:31.437
still standing
when last I saw them.

33:31.476 --> 33:34.240
- And your...
- Tulips?

33:34.278 --> 33:36.473
They've seen better days.

33:36.514 --> 33:39.540
Now listen.
We have an issue, don't we?

33:39.584 --> 33:41.108
About noise.

33:43.721 --> 33:45.552
I'm trying to make the team.

33:45.590 --> 33:49.924
My dad isn't here to help me.
So I practice alone.

33:52.130 --> 33:54.189
Well, that's not my problem.

33:54.232 --> 33:56.132
Besides, I hate soccer.

33:56.167 --> 33:58.032
You hate soccer?

33:58.069 --> 34:00.936
Yes, it always makes
me feel miserable.

34:00.972 --> 34:02.530
You have a problem.

34:04.475 --> 34:07.535
Yes, as a matter of fact,
I do have a problem with it.

34:07.578 --> 34:09.170
And it's my business.

34:11.149 --> 34:15.552
Now look, though I hate to say this,
your daddy is indeed right.

34:15.585 --> 34:18.054
In order to get better,
you must practice.

34:18.089 --> 34:21.183
I can't believe those words
came out of my mouth.

34:21.225 --> 34:25.355
I will practice,
but what about the noise?

34:25.396 --> 34:28.228
Oh, that? Well,

34:28.266 --> 34:31.326
well, we'll just have to make...

34:31.369 --> 34:33.837
noise less noisy, if you...

34:33.871 --> 34:35.735
You can wear earplugs.

34:35.773 --> 34:37.638
Yes, well, we'll.

34:37.675 --> 34:39.574
Hey, Chris,
get back in the house.

34:43.681 --> 34:46.241
With our soldiers
in the battlefield today,

34:46.284 --> 34:48.684
tanks, cannons, artillery...

34:52.255 --> 34:55.521
Oh, those wars
are taking a toll on us.

34:55.560 --> 34:57.892
Enough already.

34:57.929 --> 35:00.898
Let's get you a little bite to eat.

35:00.932 --> 35:02.422
How you feeling?

35:06.204 --> 35:08.331
I'm a mess.

35:08.372 --> 35:10.932
You were lucky.

35:10.975 --> 35:13.307
Very lucky.

35:15.346 --> 35:16.643
Let's try this.

35:23.554 --> 35:26.216
Nice to meet you,
Nurse White.

35:26.257 --> 35:30.557
My name is Mary.
Mary White.

35:30.595 --> 35:34.053
And it's a pleasure meeting you,
too, Kathleen Larou.

35:35.700 --> 35:38.362
He's gonna need
that smile, you know.

35:40.338 --> 35:42.135
That little angel of yours.

35:43.841 --> 35:45.206
Know why?

35:47.678 --> 35:49.043
Why?

35:49.080 --> 35:53.176
'Cause the strength of a mother

35:53.217 --> 35:55.845
is the only way to lift
the spirit of a child.

35:58.422 --> 36:00.219
You remember that.

36:02.760 --> 36:04.591
Kathleen Larou.

36:13.704 --> 36:15.467
Steve, to Mark!

36:16.941 --> 36:19.466
- Come on!

36:24.782 --> 36:26.613
Come on, guys!

36:27.618 --> 36:29.313
- Hit him, Willie.
- Hit him!

36:29.353 --> 36:31.116
Attack the ball!

36:37.895 --> 36:39.590
- Get it out of there!

36:42.800 --> 36:44.791
Julian, don't just stand there!

36:47.905 --> 36:49.566
What's the use?

36:49.607 --> 36:51.404
Go, Willie, go!

36:51.442 --> 36:53.307
Come on!
You should know better!

36:53.344 --> 36:54.777
It's only the first half, too.

36:54.812 --> 36:57.508
Boy, Jackson's gonna take
this one all the way, pal.

36:57.548 --> 36:59.982
Thanks for sharing, Frank.

37:00.017 --> 37:02.679
Just saying.
That's the way it goes, man.

37:02.720 --> 37:04.085
Julian!

37:10.061 --> 37:11.926
I really should quit.

37:14.999 --> 37:17.331
All right, guys, bring it in!

37:17.368 --> 37:20.860
Sometime today, Julian, come on.
You can rest on the bench.

37:24.008 --> 37:25.498
We're not scoring
on the breaks, guys.

37:25.543 --> 37:29.343
If we manage to beat them,
we'll be on top of the league.

37:29.380 --> 37:32.281
We could play in the finals
of this tournament.

37:32.316 --> 37:35.149
Which means we'll have a shot
at competing

37:35.186 --> 37:37.620
in the Regional
State Championship games.

37:37.655 --> 37:40.715
Christian, I'm putting you in
for a full half.

37:40.758 --> 37:43.158
- What?!
- What?

37:43.194 --> 37:46.630
- Donald, put on your sweat suit.
- Dominic, come here, buddy.

37:49.667 --> 37:50.964
You're not being fair to Chris.

37:51.002 --> 37:52.993
Way too much pressure
on that kid, pal.

37:53.037 --> 37:55.301
Look, he needs to get his mind
off his family,

37:55.339 --> 37:57.603
if not just for half an hour.

37:57.642 --> 37:59.667
Dominic,

37:59.710 --> 38:03.305
you have 30 days for my money.
Then I'm taking legal action.

38:03.347 --> 38:05.907
Well, there you go, Frank.
That's the spirit.

38:05.950 --> 38:08.919
Thank you so much.
All right, Stars!

38:08.953 --> 38:10.511
Let's get out there!
Show them no mercy!

38:10.554 --> 38:13.114
- Crush them! Come on!
- Yeah!

38:14.992 --> 38:17.153
Here we go, Julian!

38:17.194 --> 38:18.559
Here we go!

38:21.265 --> 38:23.597
How's it like living
with an angry person?

38:23.634 --> 38:24.862
It's a downer.

38:24.902 --> 38:28.065
I think angry person became angrier
when his wife died.

38:28.105 --> 38:29.970
- And now you live with him.
- Yeah.

38:30.007 --> 38:31.736
Ain't life just great?

38:31.776 --> 38:34.244
Come on.

38:38.182 --> 38:39.444
Christian!

38:44.922 --> 38:47.914
- Yes!

38:51.162 --> 38:54.131
Whoa-ho! Yeah!

38:59.970 --> 39:01.699
Yes!

39:08.279 --> 39:10.543
Not bad.

39:10.581 --> 39:12.412
Good for you, buddy.

39:15.319 --> 39:17.913
A little more sportsmanlike!

39:24.662 --> 39:26.391
Yeah!

39:53.324 --> 39:55.758
Oh! What was that?!

39:55.793 --> 39:58.318
All right, Christian,
you take it.

40:11.175 --> 40:13.803
That was, amazing!

40:15.479 --> 40:18.846
We're in.
We are so in!

40:18.883 --> 40:21.716
Whoo!

40:29.527 --> 40:31.859
Think I found my striker.

40:33.631 --> 40:36.498
- It's okay, Dad, we still won.
- Yeah.

40:42.139 --> 40:44.607
What's the golden kid's name?

40:44.642 --> 40:46.803
Christian Larou.

40:48.112 --> 40:51.172
And, uh, I'm the coach.
Dominic Klein.

40:52.817 --> 40:55.411
Uh, no, K.
E-I-N.

40:56.487 --> 40:57.511
All right.

40:57.555 --> 41:00.183
Hey, you were amazing.

41:01.358 --> 41:02.552
Hey, look at me.

41:02.593 --> 41:05.426
Promise me not to down
those bars before a game.

41:05.463 --> 41:08.057
- It's, it's hard.
- You have a problem.

41:08.098 --> 41:10.589
Keep this up
and you're on the road to CA.

41:10.634 --> 41:12.602
California?

41:13.771 --> 41:15.864
Chocolate Anonymous.

41:15.906 --> 41:18.067
I'm so weak, man!

41:19.343 --> 41:21.243
I feel better.

41:33.624 --> 41:35.057
Downtown Hospital.

41:35.092 --> 41:37.287
Kathleen Larou, please.
I'm her son.

41:37.328 --> 41:40.161
Ordering a pizza
with mushrooms?

41:40.197 --> 41:41.789
I don't like mushrooms.

41:41.832 --> 41:43.732
Go do the dishes.

42:21.639 --> 42:23.630
What are you doing?

42:28.145 --> 42:32.104
I was gonna clean your shoes,
but they look pretty clean.

42:32.149 --> 42:34.743
Go to sleep.

42:38.455 --> 42:40.787
Ed, Donald,
you guys better be in bed.

42:44.128 --> 42:46.028
With the death toll
of our soldiers rising,

42:46.063 --> 42:47.553
both sides are in hot debate

42:47.598 --> 42:49.930
as to when our boys
will finally be coming home...

42:49.967 --> 42:51.958
Here you go.
Hot off the press like you like it.

42:52.002 --> 42:53.833
It's affecting our nation's morale,

42:53.871 --> 42:56.271
the effects of which
are not known as of yet.

42:56.307 --> 43:00.209
With all the nation's problems
from the escalating wars, health care...

43:00.244 --> 43:02.337
- Hey.
- Yeah?

43:02.379 --> 43:04.370
Get the news crew together.

43:04.415 --> 43:06.815
- Sure.
- ...and how fast can it happen?

43:06.850 --> 43:10.445
And now to sports, England's Youth
Soccer Team is making headlines

43:10.487 --> 43:13.513
and making a splash
by beating Italy 2 to 0,

43:13.557 --> 43:16.048
securing a spot in
the Youth World Cup finals.

43:16.093 --> 43:18.220
You'll remember, of course,
England won last year,

43:18.262 --> 43:20.753
but the big question is
what about the US?

43:20.798 --> 43:23.665
Our national team has yet
to make it to the finals

43:23.701 --> 43:26.465
and they're struggling once again,
and chances are grim

43:26.503 --> 43:29.472
after being beaten by Brazil
1 to 0.

43:29.506 --> 43:31.940
Now, analysts are saying
we lack the stars

43:31.976 --> 43:33.603
to carry us into a championship

43:33.644 --> 43:36.044
or even reach the competition.

43:45.589 --> 43:49.389
Hello, this is Dominic Klein
from the Michigan Youth League.

43:49.426 --> 43:51.587
Is Mitch McClaine around?

43:51.629 --> 43:53.187
Thanks.

43:55.499 --> 43:57.660
Hey, Mitch, it's Dominic.

43:57.701 --> 43:59.328
How are you?

43:59.370 --> 44:01.361
Yeah!

44:01.405 --> 44:03.100
We just might do that.

44:03.140 --> 44:04.971
Look, I know you're busy,

44:05.009 --> 44:08.274
but I have to speak to you
about this kid I have.

44:08.312 --> 44:12.214
He's, he's got the magic
that I think you should see.

44:12.249 --> 44:13.682
It's just,

44:13.717 --> 44:18.381
look, I know your time is tight
as the national team scout, but you.

44:19.890 --> 44:21.915
Yeah, I really do.

44:24.862 --> 44:27.057
Okay, great,
I'll keep you posted.

44:27.097 --> 44:29.588
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

44:35.406 --> 44:38.034
How are those burgers?
Yeah?

44:38.075 --> 44:39.599
Here you go.

44:39.643 --> 44:41.406
Thank you so much.

44:47.151 --> 44:49.176
What, burger not good enough?

44:51.221 --> 44:53.553
Ed and Donald like them.
Right, guys?

44:53.590 --> 44:54.989
Yum.

44:55.025 --> 44:56.617
For sure.

44:56.660 --> 44:58.651
I guess Chris thinks
he's a steak man.

44:58.696 --> 45:01.096
Burgers aren't good enough.

45:01.131 --> 45:03.224
I want to see Mom.

45:03.267 --> 45:05.531
I miss my wife, too,
but I'll never see her again.

45:05.569 --> 45:08.129
So toughen up, kid.
You'll see your mom in time.

45:08.172 --> 45:11.198
Count yourself lucky
I took you in.

45:12.543 --> 45:13.942
Eat your burger.

45:19.583 --> 45:22.211
Rest assured,
this issue is being addressed.

45:22.252 --> 45:24.743
The Secretary of State,
the Vice-President, and myself

45:24.788 --> 45:26.779
have had numerous discussions,

45:26.824 --> 45:29.725
and we are just about to propose
such a plan.

45:29.760 --> 45:33.594
Look, the men and women
who serve our country are our beacon.

45:33.630 --> 45:36.963
Their safety has always
been our concern.

45:37.000 --> 45:40.401
Mr. President, recent polls have
shown that our morale in our nation

45:40.437 --> 45:41.961
is at an all-time low.

45:42.005 --> 45:44.473
What is your administration
doing to address this?

45:46.276 --> 45:48.335
Why you always
glued to that stuff?

45:50.280 --> 45:53.010
My husband,

45:53.050 --> 45:54.417
George,

45:56.453 --> 45:58.717
he's MIA.

46:01.024 --> 46:03.322
Missing in action.

46:04.394 --> 46:07.158
- Hey. - Hasn't called.
- Hey, I'm sorry.

46:07.197 --> 46:08.664
I didn't know.

46:08.699 --> 46:10.690
It's okay.

46:12.069 --> 46:14.299
Look, um...

46:14.338 --> 46:17.603
I know this is none
of my business, but,

46:17.641 --> 46:20.439
a friend of yours called
when you were asleep yesterday

46:20.477 --> 46:21.808
and left a message.

46:21.845 --> 46:23.005
Is everything okay?

46:28.185 --> 46:30.176
You should seriously read this.

46:30.220 --> 46:32.154
Like, seriously.

46:33.657 --> 46:35.887
Go on.

46:35.926 --> 46:38.360
Open it up.

46:53.811 --> 46:56.780
That's my boy.

46:59.883 --> 47:02.010
That's my baby.

47:02.052 --> 47:04.111
That's right.

47:09.860 --> 47:12.761
- You gonna cry?
- Yeah.

47:12.796 --> 47:15.162
Go on, get it out.

47:15.199 --> 47:17.099
I'm here for you.

47:17.134 --> 47:19.261
Oh, look at him.

47:20.637 --> 47:24.038
Look at him.
I got to talk to him.

47:24.074 --> 47:26.099
Let me get the phone for you.
I'll get the phone for you.

47:26.143 --> 47:27.838
- There you go.
- Okay. Thank you.

47:27.878 --> 47:29.812
Yeah, call your baby, girl.

47:53.303 --> 47:55.737
- Come on, Julian.
Here we go.

47:55.772 --> 47:57.205
- Come on, Julian.

47:57.241 --> 47:59.004
There you go.

47:59.042 --> 48:01.067
All right, boys.

48:01.111 --> 48:03.671
This is it, right?

48:03.714 --> 48:07.343
Now, we are playing the league
leaders and they're good.

48:09.019 --> 48:12.182
But you guys are better.
You're my knights.

48:12.222 --> 48:15.623
We win this
and we win the league.

48:15.659 --> 48:18.389
And we can compete
in the Regional Championships.

48:18.428 --> 48:22.489
Now, go out there and have fun,
but give me nothing but your best.

48:23.767 --> 48:26.565
- Are you my knights?
- Yes, we are.

48:26.603 --> 48:28.833
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I couldn't hear that.

48:28.872 --> 48:31.534
- Yes, we are!
- All right!

48:31.575 --> 48:33.736
Now get it out there
and earn your knighthood!

48:33.777 --> 48:36.712
- Come on!

48:54.564 --> 48:57.727
WADL, reporting live.

48:58.735 --> 49:01.966
- What are they doing here?
- Filming.

49:14.651 --> 49:17.347
Defense! Defense!

49:17.387 --> 49:19.150
Get it out of there!

49:23.193 --> 49:25.218
That's all right!
Just unlucky!

49:26.530 --> 49:29.522
All right, guys, huddle up!
Here we go!

49:29.566 --> 49:31.625
I don't even know where to start.

49:31.668 --> 49:34.535
You guys are playing right
into their strategy.

49:34.571 --> 49:36.630
Now, you got
to break possessions.

49:36.673 --> 49:39.073
You got to,
you got to get in there

49:39.109 --> 49:41.100
and look for Christian
on the breaks.

49:41.144 --> 49:44.204
Christian, you got to find
the window and run for it!

49:44.247 --> 49:45.236
Okay.

49:45.282 --> 49:47.147
Now, Donald,
you're going in for Ed.

49:54.224 --> 49:56.852
I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.

49:56.893 --> 49:58.861
Oh, my gosh.

50:01.999 --> 50:03.728
Ah, that felt good.

50:03.767 --> 50:05.564
I could taste that one.

50:07.738 --> 50:10.571
- Are you okay?
- I'm not sure.

50:10.607 --> 50:12.734
Okay.

50:29.126 --> 50:30.616
Still the worrywart?

50:30.660 --> 50:33.185
Oh, Mitch!
Thanks for coming.

50:33.230 --> 50:35.061
I had another player to watch,

50:35.098 --> 50:37.532
but he was a total
waste of my time.

50:37.567 --> 50:38.932
Yeah, I understand.

50:38.969 --> 50:42.564
You're down a goal with 30 minutes left.
You got to love this game, huh?

50:42.606 --> 50:45.336
You got to love all the high blood
pressure that comes with it.

50:45.375 --> 50:47.172
Don't forget all the ulcers.

50:47.210 --> 50:48.700
Do you want an antacid?

50:48.745 --> 50:50.645
- No, thanks.
- Okay.

50:50.680 --> 50:52.170
So, who am I here to see?

50:52.215 --> 50:55.582
Christian Larou.
Number, number 11.

50:58.855 --> 51:00.186
11.

51:00.223 --> 51:02.350
Um, if you don't mind,

51:02.392 --> 51:04.587
could you just turn off your phone
during the game?

51:04.628 --> 51:06.619
Only if this Larou makes me.

51:06.663 --> 51:09.097
Okay, no problem.

51:10.867 --> 51:13.529
Get in there, guys!
Break possession!

51:15.672 --> 51:16.900
Go, Christian!

51:23.713 --> 51:25.180
Wow!

51:29.352 --> 51:31.912
- Yeah!

51:43.700 --> 51:45.065
Here we go!

51:52.843 --> 51:55.676
Control, guys!
Control it! Pass!

51:55.712 --> 51:57.077
Good.

52:03.386 --> 52:05.354
Only one minute, gents!

52:05.388 --> 52:08.755
Only one minute
and then we got overtime!

52:08.792 --> 52:10.589
That was a foul!

52:10.627 --> 52:12.185
Push it!
Get in there!

52:22.139 --> 52:23.436
Here we go, Christian!

52:52.369 --> 52:54.701
- Yeah! Nice!

53:03.580 --> 53:04.945
Way to go, boys!

53:06.850 --> 53:09.080
I want that footage edited
and on my desk tonight.

53:14.157 --> 53:15.385
Well?

53:15.425 --> 53:17.359
Well, he's a lefty.

53:17.394 --> 53:19.760
If I show up again
for this number 11,

53:19.796 --> 53:22.264
if, could be
real good for him.

53:22.299 --> 53:24.233
Thanks a million for coming out.

53:24.267 --> 53:26.326
I can't tell you
what it means to his family.

53:26.369 --> 53:29.361
- We'll talk soon.
- All right.

53:35.979 --> 53:38.140
Yeah! Come on! Yeah!

53:41.851 --> 53:43.910
Hey, my knights.

53:43.954 --> 53:48.015
We are competing in the Regional
State Championship!

53:48.058 --> 53:50.390
Yeah! Fun! Yeah!

53:50.427 --> 53:52.361
You know what?

53:52.395 --> 53:54.124
I'm feeling,

53:54.164 --> 53:55.756
like pizza!

53:58.935 --> 54:01.233
Dig in!
Remember to share.

54:05.141 --> 54:07.439
Cristiano, can I have
your autograph, please?

54:07.477 --> 54:08.637
Sure.

54:11.514 --> 54:13.573
Thank you.

54:13.617 --> 54:14.948
Dude!

54:14.985 --> 54:16.316
Why didn't you get
her phone number?

54:19.322 --> 54:21.620
Hey, take it easy on the pizza.

54:21.658 --> 54:24.991
Don't push it. Next game,
we meet Brendon the Bull.

54:25.028 --> 54:27.394
He's known to lift you
right off your feet.

54:27.430 --> 54:28.988
Don't forget it.

54:29.032 --> 54:30.761
Hey,

54:30.800 --> 54:32.893
I got this.

54:32.936 --> 54:35.996
No worries.
I'm taking that bull down!

54:39.242 --> 54:42.541
Great game, guys.
Really great game.

54:42.579 --> 54:45.412
So are you
enjoying the pizza?

54:45.448 --> 54:46.915
Yes, Mr. Granger.

54:46.950 --> 54:48.349
Call me Frank.

54:48.385 --> 54:50.876
Boy, those boots
sure came in handy, huh?

54:54.291 --> 54:56.020
You know, you've been
doing your chores at home

54:56.059 --> 54:57.651
and I think it's time for a treat.

54:57.694 --> 55:00.492
How about I buy you
some new boots, huh?

55:00.530 --> 55:04.193
- I'm happy with them, sir.
- It's Frank, remember?

55:04.234 --> 55:06.634
I'd like to buy you
the newest pair

55:06.670 --> 55:08.729
of soccer boots made,
what do you say?

55:08.772 --> 55:11.798
No, Frank.
I'm happy with them.

55:11.841 --> 55:14.776
- But thank you.
- Okay.

55:16.613 --> 55:19.582
You played a great game.
So did you.

55:19.616 --> 55:22.244
Hell of a shot.

55:22.285 --> 55:23.752
You're not so good, huh?

55:27.090 --> 55:30.389
Hey.
I have an idea.

55:30.427 --> 55:32.554
What do you say,
let me kick his butt.

55:32.595 --> 55:34.290
I mean, I can kick his butt.

55:34.331 --> 55:36.526
You know, I'm gonna go
kick his butt right now.

55:36.566 --> 55:39.034
Hold on. Focus.

55:39.069 --> 55:43.870
I know that you can do
some serious damage.

55:43.907 --> 55:45.738
But not today.

55:45.775 --> 55:48.608
But I really want to kick his butt.
You know why?

55:48.645 --> 55:51.136
I mean, check out this puppy!

55:51.181 --> 55:52.978
I mean, seriously, look at that.

55:53.016 --> 55:55.746
Focus! Not today!

55:55.785 --> 55:58.083
Okay.
I guess I got you, man.

55:58.121 --> 56:00.715
That should cool you down.

56:00.757 --> 56:03.225
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

56:07.263 --> 56:08.560
What?

56:08.598 --> 56:10.896
I want to show
you something.

56:15.338 --> 56:17.329
It's not very often,
but every now and then,

56:17.374 --> 56:19.740
a miracle happens
in the smallest of towns.

56:19.776 --> 56:22.244
And it happened
during a soccer game.

56:22.278 --> 56:25.270
His name is Christian Larou,
and the child phenom

56:25.315 --> 56:28.284
may be just the type of player
the US Youth National Team needs

56:28.318 --> 56:30.149
to make it to the World Cup.

56:30.186 --> 56:33.644
Larou plays for the Northern Stars
in the city of Farmington Hills

56:33.690 --> 56:37.456
and his coach Dominic Klein tells us
he couldn't come at a better time

56:37.494 --> 56:39.894
at this point when the country,
his team,

56:39.929 --> 56:41.624
and his family needs him most.

56:44.667 --> 56:46.464
Now that was cool.

56:51.474 --> 56:54.238
Oh, don't you be sad.
Be proud.

56:56.045 --> 56:57.842
I just,

56:57.881 --> 56:59.906
just wish his father
could see this.

57:02.285 --> 57:04.014
I mean, it,

57:04.053 --> 57:06.146
it just means so much.

57:10.827 --> 57:12.761
You know
what this really means?

57:12.796 --> 57:14.423
What?

57:14.464 --> 57:18.992
That behind every son
is a strong mother.

57:19.035 --> 57:20.400
He needs you.

57:21.905 --> 57:24.465
Now you need to get strong enough
and get out of this bed.

58:06.115 --> 58:09.516
One of the most spectacular goals
by perhaps one of the youngest players

58:09.552 --> 58:11.543
we've been privileged enough
to have been graced with,

58:11.588 --> 58:16.025
his talent is instinctual,
to say the least.

58:16.059 --> 58:17.424
What are you thinking, Margie?

58:17.460 --> 58:20.122
I don't know.

58:22.065 --> 58:25.694
Who knows?
No stone unturned, right?

58:31.107 --> 58:33.701
Get me the person
that shot that.

58:42.685 --> 58:44.585
Man.

01:00:06.669 --> 01:00:07.931
Dear God.

01:00:07.971 --> 01:00:10.235
I want to say a prayer
for my mom and dad,

01:00:10.273 --> 01:00:12.366
but I don't know what to say.

01:00:12.408 --> 01:00:15.206
Please, please hear my prayer.

01:00:15.244 --> 01:00:18.611
I miss them so much.

01:00:18.648 --> 01:00:20.616
It's okay if I'm here.

01:00:20.650 --> 01:00:23.118
I'll be all right.

01:00:23.152 --> 01:00:27.612
Also, if you can help Frank,
that'll be great.

01:00:27.657 --> 01:00:31.252
Thank you, God,
for listening to me.

01:00:36.032 --> 01:00:37.795
Amen.

01:00:40.937 --> 01:00:45.601
My knights, you won because
you are a team of fighters.

01:00:45.642 --> 01:00:48.873
Now, warriors never give up.

01:00:48.911 --> 01:00:52.142
So you are no longer my knights.

01:00:52.181 --> 01:00:55.582
You are now my warrior knights!

01:00:55.618 --> 01:00:58.610
Now, win this game for me,

01:00:58.655 --> 01:01:01.055
for you, for your city!

01:01:01.090 --> 01:01:03.718
For your family.

01:01:05.128 --> 01:01:07.392
Win us this game.
Now, what are we?

01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:09.261
Warrior knights!

01:01:09.298 --> 01:01:11.425
- What are we?!
- Warrior knights!

01:01:11.467 --> 01:01:14.595
All right, now get out there!
Good luck!

01:01:14.637 --> 01:01:16.662
WADL reporting live.

01:01:16.706 --> 01:01:19.266
Northern Stars coming into this game
as the underdogs.

01:01:19.308 --> 01:01:22.243
WAZA, very much the favorites,
had a great season.

01:01:22.278 --> 01:01:26.305
Their defense is anchored
by that big man, Brendon the Bull.

01:01:28.985 --> 01:01:30.953
Come on,
come on, get it back!

01:01:35.158 --> 01:01:37.524
Here's a WAZA player,
gets loose on the left,

01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:39.551
but Julian makes a great save.

01:01:39.595 --> 01:01:42.962
Looked like Tim Howard as he rose
up to take it in the corner.

01:01:42.999 --> 01:01:46.491
But it's still WAZA on the move
cutting down the left hand side.

01:01:46.536 --> 01:01:48.401
Lovely move.
Faked out a defender.

01:01:48.438 --> 01:01:50.531
Opportunities coming for WAZA.

01:01:50.573 --> 01:01:53.167
This one is deflected
by a Northern Stars player

01:01:53.209 --> 01:01:55.905
out behind for a corner.

01:01:55.945 --> 01:01:59.938
Now number 7, Keenan,
on the ball.

01:01:59.982 --> 01:02:02.678
But it's still WAZA.
They're asking all the questions.

01:02:02.719 --> 01:02:04.880
Into the middle comes the ball.
Willie's beaten.

01:02:04.921 --> 01:02:07.446
And a left-foot shot
goes by the post again.

01:02:07.490 --> 01:02:10.186
But WAZA looked as if they're
gonna get a goal in this game.

01:02:10.226 --> 01:02:12.922
Clearly the dominant team so far.

01:02:12.962 --> 01:02:15.954
Bringing the ball out
over the halfway line

01:02:15.998 --> 01:02:19.058
and into the northern heart
of the Northern Stars' defense.

01:02:19.102 --> 01:02:22.594
And the cross comes across the middle
and the header is a goal!

01:02:22.638 --> 01:02:27.302
And Julian was a little slow to react
and it puts WAZA up 1-0

01:02:27.343 --> 01:02:29.903
in this important playoff game.

01:02:33.483 --> 01:02:35.348
- And it's Brendon The Bull there...

01:02:35.384 --> 01:02:37.579
- ...with a terrible tackle...
- What was that?

01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:40.020
...using his physical presence.

01:02:40.056 --> 01:02:43.492
Awful tackle and a yellow card
quite rightly there.

01:02:43.526 --> 01:02:45.323
Finally, we get
a Northern Stars attack

01:02:45.361 --> 01:02:47.488
and the shot goes past the post

01:02:47.530 --> 01:02:51.091
much to the dissatisfaction of the many
Northern Stars supporters here.

01:02:51.134 --> 01:02:52.658
But Christian Larou
now on the ball.

01:02:52.702 --> 01:02:54.863
Beats one man.
Beats a second man.

01:02:54.904 --> 01:02:56.769
Left-foot shot and the equalizer.

01:02:56.806 --> 01:02:59.570
- A goal for the Northern Stars!
- Yeah!

01:02:59.609 --> 01:03:02.203
It's 1-1.
No wonder the coach is happy.

01:03:02.245 --> 01:03:05.305
And now it's Larou on the ball again.
Lots of players in front of him.

01:03:05.348 --> 01:03:09.842
What can he do here?
Oh, a little flick-over, a rainbow.

01:03:09.886 --> 01:03:11.751
Does the same thing again.

01:03:11.788 --> 01:03:15.554
Got through a crowd of players
and he gets a left foot shot!

01:03:15.591 --> 01:03:19.254
2-1 to the Northern Stars!

01:03:19.295 --> 01:03:21.991
Absolutely incredible turn
of events here.

01:03:22.031 --> 01:03:24.659
Whoo! Nice!

01:03:24.700 --> 01:03:27.168
Hey, good job.

01:03:27.203 --> 01:03:30.104
Nice. Oh!

01:03:30.139 --> 01:03:32.664
- Oh, Julian!

01:03:32.708 --> 01:03:34.073
Hey, Dominic.

01:03:42.885 --> 01:03:44.580
Wow.

01:03:57.733 --> 01:04:01.567
Oh, hi, kid. I was just,
I was tidying up.

01:04:01.604 --> 01:04:03.572
I'll get out of your way.

01:04:05.842 --> 01:04:09.209
Well, go to sleep
and I'll see you tomorrow.

01:04:37.073 --> 01:04:40.065
Whoo-hoo!

01:04:48.317 --> 01:04:50.842
A goal!

01:04:53.723 --> 01:04:56.521
- My boy, whoo!
- Go, Christian!

01:05:10.039 --> 01:05:12.098
Yes!

01:05:14.677 --> 01:05:18.636
In the finals
for the first time ever!

01:06:00.456 --> 01:06:03.016
- Hello?
- Hi, Frank? It's Kathleen.

01:06:03.059 --> 01:06:05.391
Hi.
How you holding up?

01:06:05.428 --> 01:06:08.397
I'm getting there.

01:06:08.431 --> 01:06:10.023
How is Christian?

01:06:10.066 --> 01:06:12.899
Fine.
He's doing really well.

01:06:12.935 --> 01:06:14.766
Could I talk to him?

01:06:14.804 --> 01:06:17.170
Uh, Kathleen,
with the game coming up

01:06:17.206 --> 01:06:20.266
and all the pressure he's under,
it may affect him.

01:06:20.309 --> 01:06:22.209
Oh. Yeah.

01:06:22.244 --> 01:06:24.405
Uh,

01:06:24.447 --> 01:06:26.108
I suppose you're right.

01:06:27.783 --> 01:06:30.616
Well, would you
just please tell him that,

01:06:30.653 --> 01:06:32.678
that I love him

01:06:32.722 --> 01:06:36.283
and that I miss him very much.

01:06:36.325 --> 01:06:37.656
I want to talk to Mom.

01:06:37.693 --> 01:06:40.992
Was that Christian?
Frank, is there something wrong?

01:06:41.030 --> 01:06:43.260
No, not at all.
He's just playing with the kids.

01:06:43.299 --> 01:06:46.496
Never give up, for it brings success,
and that's the best revenge.

01:06:46.535 --> 01:06:48.435
Kathleen, take care now, baby.

01:06:48.471 --> 01:06:50.598
- Okay, bye-bye.
- Wait, I...

01:06:53.776 --> 01:06:55.710
I can't believe
after everything I've done for you

01:06:55.745 --> 01:06:57.440
that this is how you thank me.

01:06:57.480 --> 01:06:59.072
You want to be
on the streets, alone?

01:06:59.115 --> 01:07:00.309
No.

01:07:02.618 --> 01:07:04.643
All right,
go to the basement, Chris.

01:07:04.687 --> 01:07:06.348
My name is Christian,
not Chris.

01:07:06.389 --> 01:07:09.051
What do you know about standing
up for yourself, kid, huh?

01:07:09.091 --> 01:07:11.753
- My dad read me this story.
- Basement.

01:07:29.812 --> 01:07:32.872
Mr. President.

01:07:32.915 --> 01:07:35.543
You should take a look at this.

01:07:43.025 --> 01:07:45.721
Father MIA.

01:07:45.761 --> 01:07:47.991
Mother in the hospital.

01:07:48.030 --> 01:07:49.327
And the boy?

01:07:49.365 --> 01:07:51.959
An only child.

01:07:53.469 --> 01:07:55.801
He's living with neighbors.

01:07:55.838 --> 01:07:58.568
He has no one, Mr. President.

01:07:58.607 --> 01:08:00.541
He has us.

01:08:02.378 --> 01:08:05.677
So this kid
led his team to the finals.

01:08:05.714 --> 01:08:09.343
For the first time.
The game is in two days.

01:08:15.791 --> 01:08:18.658
I want George Larou
at that game.

01:08:26.068 --> 01:08:28.764
Can you hear me, Zulu Nine?
Can you hear me?

01:08:31.307 --> 01:08:33.639
Can you hear me, Zulu Nine?
Can you hear me?

01:08:35.277 --> 01:08:37.801
Can you hear me, Zulu Nine?
Can you hear me?

01:08:37.846 --> 01:08:41.305
- Nothing, sir.
- Those are our boys out there.

01:08:42.518 --> 01:08:44.212
Get me the president.

01:08:44.252 --> 01:08:47.221
All right.
I know these aren't your faves.

01:08:47.256 --> 01:08:49.587
We're gonna give them
another try today, okay?

01:08:53.662 --> 01:08:57.621
My name is Margie Epberg.
I was sent by the president.

01:08:59.033 --> 01:09:01.332
The president?

01:09:04.106 --> 01:09:07.337
Ladies and gentlemen, I called
this press conference this afternoon

01:09:07.376 --> 01:09:09.276
because I have a heartfelt story

01:09:09.310 --> 01:09:12.178
that must be shared
with the American people.

01:09:12.214 --> 01:09:16.344
Today, ladies and gentlemen,
I was informed of a young boy,

01:09:16.385 --> 01:09:19.821
a young American boy
who lost his dad in the war.

01:09:19.854 --> 01:09:23.291
Later, he found out that his mother
was rushed to the hospital

01:09:23.325 --> 01:09:25.292
as a result of a sudden accident.

01:09:25.327 --> 01:09:29.889
Yet, through sheer determination,
this boy rose to his full potential

01:09:29.932 --> 01:09:32.627
and he led his team
to the State Regional Finals

01:09:32.667 --> 01:09:34.898
for the very first time.

01:09:34.937 --> 01:09:37.633
We as Americans
care for each other.

01:09:37.673 --> 01:09:39.970
Zero Charlie Seven
approaching Dragonfly.

01:09:44.613 --> 01:09:47.548
Our freedoms and our liberty
will never be lost

01:09:47.582 --> 01:09:51.484
and your government
will adhere to that principle

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:53.886
and protect it.

01:09:53.923 --> 01:09:57.222
Now, this boy has been
without his parents.

01:09:57.259 --> 01:10:00.126
His mother,
who is still bedridden,

01:10:00.162 --> 01:10:03.029
is unaware of her husband's fate.

01:10:03.065 --> 01:10:06.432
I called her this morning,
as a matter of fact,

01:10:06.468 --> 01:10:10.370
to tell her that I will do everything
in my power to find him.

01:10:28.791 --> 01:10:33.091
I'm pleased to tell you,
I have good news.

01:10:33.128 --> 01:10:34.857
We found the father.

01:10:34.897 --> 01:10:36.831
He's alive

01:10:36.865 --> 01:10:39.390
and he's headed back home.

01:10:41.303 --> 01:10:44.534
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Roop, yes.

01:10:44.573 --> 01:10:46.939
People want to know
what are the names?

01:10:46.976 --> 01:10:48.534
Who are these people?
Do we have names?

01:10:48.577 --> 01:10:51.876
The soldier's name, Roop,
is George Larou...

01:10:51.914 --> 01:10:54.747
...father of Christian Larou,

01:10:54.783 --> 01:10:56.774
husband of Kathleen Larou.

01:10:56.819 --> 01:10:58.650
My husband's alive!

01:10:58.687 --> 01:11:00.552
You listen.
You listen to me.

01:11:00.589 --> 01:11:04.582
You rise up
like the proud mother you are,

01:11:04.627 --> 01:11:07.118
and by God,
you walk to your family.

01:11:07.162 --> 01:11:08.857
You hear me?

01:11:12.301 --> 01:11:14.667
The soldier is George Larou.

01:11:14.703 --> 01:11:19.299
father of Christian Larou,
husband of Kathleen Larou.

01:11:19.341 --> 01:11:21.502
Come on.

01:11:28.417 --> 01:11:30.715
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
listen, I'm just here to say

01:11:30.753 --> 01:11:32.778
if this isn't a hero's story,

01:11:32.821 --> 01:11:36.655
if this, isn't a story
to inspire a nation,

01:11:36.692 --> 01:11:39.252
then I don't know what will.

01:11:41.130 --> 01:11:44.258
And now if you'll excuse me,
I've got a soccer game to catch.

01:12:09.058 --> 01:12:11.549
- Hello?

01:12:11.593 --> 01:12:13.527
Frank! Hello!

01:12:13.562 --> 01:12:16.429
And finally,
after this long season,

01:12:16.465 --> 01:12:18.490
the players are coming
out for the final.

01:12:18.534 --> 01:12:22.470
The Northern Stars
and DC United.

01:12:26.442 --> 01:12:27.932
Looking across
the lineup, though,

01:12:27.976 --> 01:12:31.139
I'm wondering,
where is Christian Larou?

01:12:31.180 --> 01:12:36.049
Only thing missing from this
game is Christian Larou.

01:12:37.119 --> 01:12:38.416
Frank! Frank!

01:12:39.955 --> 01:12:42.549
That is annoying!
That is very annoying!

01:12:42.591 --> 01:12:44.422
Where are you going?

01:12:46.161 --> 01:12:47.958
Charlie, help! Help!

01:12:47.996 --> 01:12:50.226
- Charlie, please help me!

01:12:58.340 --> 01:13:00.399
- What do you want?
- Help! Help!

01:13:00.442 --> 01:13:01.534
What do you want, boy?

01:13:01.577 --> 01:13:03.568
Charlie, help me!
Please help me!

01:13:03.612 --> 01:13:05.136
You again?

01:13:05.180 --> 01:13:08.308
Why does it always
happen to be you?

01:13:08.350 --> 01:13:09.817
Well, perhaps you can give me

01:13:09.852 --> 01:13:12.980
a good reason
why I should help you,

01:13:13.021 --> 01:13:17.424
you who have been
a most persistent nuisance!

01:13:30.172 --> 01:13:32.572
Get back, boy.
Just get back!

01:13:33.575 --> 01:13:35.566
Get back, boy!

01:13:40.115 --> 01:13:42.982
Get right back!
Out of the way!

01:13:45.087 --> 01:13:47.555
- Where is he?
- He wasn't feeling well.

01:13:47.589 --> 01:13:51.787
I gave him some medication,
but his fever would not budge.

01:13:51.827 --> 01:13:53.624
I waited, but, you know.

01:13:53.662 --> 01:13:55.527
- Just my luck.
- What's that?

01:13:55.564 --> 01:13:56.997
Nothing.

01:13:59.201 --> 01:14:02.034
All right.
Are you all right, boy?

01:14:02.070 --> 01:14:03.867
Did you get cut
or anything like that?

01:14:03.906 --> 01:14:06.033
No.

01:14:06.074 --> 01:14:08.235
Thank you.

01:14:08.277 --> 01:14:10.541
You're welcome.

01:14:10.579 --> 01:14:12.012
What happened?

01:14:12.047 --> 01:14:14.538
- Frank locked me in.
- Frank locked you in?

01:14:14.583 --> 01:14:17.711
- Yeah.
- Never did like that son of a bitch.

01:14:17.753 --> 01:14:18.981
I'm late for my game.

01:14:19.021 --> 01:14:21.319
So I suppose you want somebody
to take you there.

01:14:21.356 --> 01:14:22.983
Yeah.
If you don't mind.

01:14:25.727 --> 01:14:28.025
All right, laddie.

01:14:28.063 --> 01:14:30.293
Come on then, let's go.

01:14:33.101 --> 01:14:35.626
Wow. Nice wheels.

01:14:35.671 --> 01:14:37.229
Thank you.

01:14:37.272 --> 01:14:40.366
Wait.
Am I seeing soccer trophies?

01:14:42.744 --> 01:14:44.678
And you hate the game?

01:14:51.186 --> 01:14:53.154
All right, all right.

01:14:54.957 --> 01:14:56.652
I'm busted.

01:14:59.027 --> 01:15:02.793
In my time, I was good.

01:15:02.831 --> 01:15:04.162
No, actually, I,

01:15:05.567 --> 01:15:08.331
I was really good.

01:15:08.370 --> 01:15:10.770
Soccer was my entire life.

01:15:12.374 --> 01:15:14.137
And then, uh...

01:15:14.176 --> 01:15:16.474
one day, my life changed.

01:15:16.512 --> 01:15:18.377
I had an accident.

01:15:18.413 --> 01:15:21.576
I broke my legs
and I broke my back.

01:15:23.352 --> 01:15:26.253
And in all those years
when I should've been playing soccer

01:15:26.288 --> 01:15:28.347
at an international level,

01:15:29.491 --> 01:15:31.425
I was learning to walk again.

01:15:31.460 --> 01:15:34.190
So I,

01:15:35.998 --> 01:15:39.126
I just, I had to turn
my back on soccer.

01:15:39.167 --> 01:15:41.727
You know, I,
I couldn't play anymore.

01:15:41.770 --> 01:15:43.965
I couldn't bear to watch it.

01:15:44.006 --> 01:15:47.464
And I was doing very, very well.

01:15:47.509 --> 01:15:50.842
Until one day,
a rather annoying little boy

01:15:50.879 --> 01:15:54.144
next door started practicing.

01:15:54.182 --> 01:15:59.552
And I had to endure
his irritating training sessions.

01:16:01.623 --> 01:16:04.217
And you know what happened?

01:16:06.728 --> 01:16:09.424
Damn it, once again,

01:16:09.464 --> 01:16:12.126
I fell in love
with a beautiful game.

01:16:13.435 --> 01:16:16.097
Touching.
No, really.

01:16:16.138 --> 01:16:17.298
Touching.

01:16:19.675 --> 01:16:20.835
The game!
The game!

01:16:22.411 --> 01:16:24.311
Here we go.
Here we go.

01:16:24.346 --> 01:16:26.507
- Go, go, go, go!
- Bring it, bring it!

01:16:28.817 --> 01:16:30.512
- Go, Will!

01:16:30.552 --> 01:16:32.076
Oh, man.

01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:34.520
- Help him out!

01:17:14.963 --> 01:17:16.521
Attack the ball!

01:17:20.335 --> 01:17:24.203
Penalty against the Northern Stars.

01:17:24.239 --> 01:17:25.536
Come on, ref!

01:17:25.574 --> 01:17:28.270
I don't fancy Julian's chances.

01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:30.039
- He's looking nervous.

01:17:37.052 --> 01:17:39.577
I'm done.

01:17:50.599 --> 01:17:54.831
Ladies and gentlemen, Christian Larou
is actually entering the stadium.

01:17:54.870 --> 01:17:56.667
Christian!

01:17:56.705 --> 01:17:58.297
Hey, buddy,
I heard you were sick.

01:17:58.340 --> 01:18:01.207
Sorry I'm late.
But I feel better.

01:18:01.243 --> 01:18:03.837
Well, I'm glad you're better,
but we're down a goal.

01:18:06.915 --> 01:18:11.045
The ball flying up
into the Northern Stars region.

01:18:12.487 --> 01:18:14.216
- Oh, no.
- What?

01:18:14.256 --> 01:18:16.520
- My boots.
- What boots?

01:18:16.558 --> 01:18:19.083
The ones I play with.

01:18:19.127 --> 01:18:21.527
That's all right, we got extras.
Here, play with these.

01:18:21.563 --> 01:18:23.929
You don't understand.
I can't play with anything else.

01:18:23.965 --> 01:18:26.934
You're right.
I don't understand.

01:18:26.968 --> 01:18:29.960
I can't play without them.
I'm no good without my boots.

01:18:30.005 --> 01:18:31.973
Hey, listen to me.

01:18:32.007 --> 01:18:35.807
All my life I wanted to be a winner
and I never got close.

01:18:35.844 --> 01:18:39.575
But you got me there.
You got me here.

01:18:39.614 --> 01:18:42.777
I've seen you do magic
out on that field.

01:18:44.820 --> 01:18:46.811
It's not because of your boots.

01:18:46.855 --> 01:18:48.982
It's because of you.

01:18:49.024 --> 01:18:51.788
It's because you play with heart.

01:18:51.827 --> 01:18:54.057
No one can take
that away from you.

01:18:55.530 --> 01:18:58.260
I believe in you
like you're one of my own.

01:18:58.300 --> 01:19:00.825
Now, put these shoes on
and let's do this.

01:19:08.376 --> 01:19:10.936
Christian Larou
has entered the game.

01:19:10.979 --> 01:19:13.743
Can this raise
the Northern Stars' spirits?

01:19:16.151 --> 01:19:19.450
Washington DC United
still on the move.

01:19:19.488 --> 01:19:22.889
But the play's broken up by Willie.
Nice ball forward to Christian.

01:19:22.924 --> 01:19:25.484
Christian is moving in the defense,
a left-foot shot.

01:19:25.527 --> 01:19:28.155
Oh, it looked
as if he had scored,

01:19:28.196 --> 01:19:30.221
but in fact,
it's in the side netting.

01:19:34.803 --> 01:19:37.431
United are moving in
again on Julian

01:19:37.472 --> 01:19:39.838
and the Stars' goal,
but it's broken up.

01:19:39.875 --> 01:19:42.002
Northern Stars are in control
of the the ball again!

01:19:42.043 --> 01:19:43.738
They've got it!

01:19:52.487 --> 01:19:53.920
Shoot!

01:19:55.824 --> 01:19:58.315
- It's a goal!
- Yeah!

01:19:58.360 --> 01:20:01.193
It's an incredible goal
inside the left upright!

01:20:01.229 --> 01:20:03.197
Whoo!
This is for you!

01:20:03.231 --> 01:20:05.165
Tied game at this point!

01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:09.796
Christian Larou has done
what he was expected to do!

01:20:18.113 --> 01:20:20.673
Hey.

01:20:20.715 --> 01:20:22.615
George.

01:20:22.651 --> 01:20:24.448
Baby, I thought
you were dead!

01:20:27.022 --> 01:20:29.217
Come on, only two minutes,
my warriors!

01:20:29.257 --> 01:20:31.248
Here we go!

01:20:31.293 --> 01:20:34.285
We're moving into the dying
seconds of this game now.

01:20:34.329 --> 01:20:37.230
The nation title is on the line.

01:20:37.265 --> 01:20:40.564
Northern Stars
bringing the ball out now

01:20:40.602 --> 01:20:43.230
down the right-hand side.

01:20:43.271 --> 01:20:45.831
It's a lovely attack
from the Northern Stars.

01:20:45.874 --> 01:20:48.434
Pass!
Pass it to him!

01:20:54.983 --> 01:20:57.110
It's a goal!
Yes!

01:20:57.152 --> 01:20:58.949
- Goal!
- Yeah!

01:21:04.659 --> 01:21:06.854
That was awesome!
That was awesome!

01:21:06.895 --> 01:21:07.953
Christian!

01:21:07.996 --> 01:21:11.932
Northern Stars 2-1
in the lead in the final

01:21:11.967 --> 01:21:15.130
as we enter the last seconds
of the game!

01:21:15.170 --> 01:21:16.899
Oh, my God, he did it!

01:21:16.938 --> 01:21:18.098
Oh, look at that!

01:21:19.608 --> 01:21:21.633
Oh, look at that.

01:21:28.516 --> 01:21:30.450
One, two, three!

01:21:33.021 --> 01:21:35.319
Good boy.

01:21:43.098 --> 01:21:46.465
The Northern Stars have
won the National Championship

01:21:46.501 --> 01:21:48.799
for the first time in their history.

01:21:48.837 --> 01:21:52.329
An incredible achievement.

01:21:52.374 --> 01:21:54.274
- Thanks for the pass.
- You're cool, man.

01:21:54.309 --> 01:21:56.743
I still got your golden boots.
You want them back?

01:21:56.778 --> 01:21:58.643
Just bring them sometime.

01:22:03.952 --> 01:22:05.886
- Great game.
- Epic.

01:22:23.939 --> 01:22:25.497
Christian.

01:22:25.540 --> 01:22:27.906
Mom! Dad!

01:22:31.112 --> 01:22:32.374
Christian.

01:22:32.414 --> 01:22:34.348
I missed you so much, Dad.

01:22:34.382 --> 01:22:36.179
My boy.
I love you so much.

01:22:38.286 --> 01:22:40.277
I love you.

01:22:40.322 --> 01:22:42.347
I love you so much.

01:22:43.358 --> 01:22:45.087
I love you.

01:22:49.631 --> 01:22:51.895
Mom and Dad.

01:22:51.933 --> 01:22:53.628
Hold this, baby.

01:22:53.668 --> 01:22:55.795
He played quite a game,
didn't he?

01:23:04.412 --> 01:23:06.243
I'll explain later.

01:23:07.682 --> 01:23:10.242
- Welcome home.
- Thank you.

01:23:10.285 --> 01:23:12.344
Nice.

01:23:14.389 --> 01:23:17.381
Paid in full, Frank.
And you're out.

01:23:21.663 --> 01:23:24.598
Hey, Golden Boy.
Great game.

01:23:24.632 --> 01:23:26.998
Your son
is an exceptional talent.

01:23:27.035 --> 01:23:28.525
He's one of the best
I've ever seen.

01:23:28.570 --> 01:23:30.231
- Thank you.
- How would you like to help

01:23:30.271 --> 01:23:32.739
the US National Youth Team
win the World Cup?

01:23:32.774 --> 01:23:34.639
It's my dream.

01:23:34.676 --> 01:23:36.200
Then we got a deal.

01:23:38.079 --> 01:23:39.774
- We'll talk soon, okay?
- Thank you so much.

01:23:39.814 --> 01:23:41.111
- Nice to meet you.
- Thank you.

01:23:43.151 --> 01:23:45.619
Love you, buddy.
Hey, go get your trophy, all right?

01:24:02.837 --> 01:24:04.532
Yeah!

01:29:01.108 --> 01:29:02.633
The End
