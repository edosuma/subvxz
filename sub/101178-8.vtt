00:02.120 --> 00:03.760
You got any history
with Joan Ferguson?

00:03.800 --> 00:05.320
She's being released
back into General.

00:05.360 --> 00:06.520
I want you to protect her.

00:06.560 --> 00:08.480
I don't want her
anywhere near Reb.

00:08.520 --> 00:11.000
I suppose it gets down to how
much Reb wants that top surgery.

00:11.040 --> 00:13.720
[Kath]<i> I want to know</i>
<i>what Joan Ferguson did.</i>

00:13.760 --> 00:15.760
I want to remember.

00:15.800 --> 00:17.320
Will you help me?

00:17.360 --> 00:18.880
You're being extradited
to the States.

00:18.920 --> 00:20.960
The U.S. are initiating
proceedings against you.

00:21.000 --> 00:23.200
[Judy]
<i>Dad, it's me.</i>
<i>They want to extradite me.</i>

00:25.680 --> 00:27.600
Dad?

00:27.640 --> 00:30.240
You must be such
a disappointment.

00:36.280 --> 00:38.560
-What the fuck was that?
-I don't know, I lost it.

00:38.600 --> 00:40.640
-Is there any sign
of who did this?
-No.

00:40.680 --> 00:42.440
-Did you tell Allie?
-No, no, I didn't tell her.

00:42.480 --> 00:43.840
Boomer.

00:43.880 --> 00:46.160
Rubes, she's really
fucked up at the moment.

00:46.200 --> 00:47.440
You know what you've done!

00:47.480 --> 00:50.080
I don't-- I can't remember.

00:50.120 --> 00:51.840
You stabbed Bea to death.

00:51.880 --> 00:54.760
Do you remember hot-shotting me,
you fucking psychopath!

00:54.800 --> 00:56.680
No, no, no!

00:56.720 --> 01:00.120
[screaming]

01:01.040 --> 01:03.240
[theme music playing]

02:03.080 --> 02:05.400
[woman]
Open the fuckin' door!

02:05.440 --> 02:08.040
[woman] Let us out!
Let us out!

02:10.280 --> 02:13.400
[woman]
Open the fuckin' doors!

02:13.440 --> 02:16.480
[woman]
Fuckin' screws!

02:16.520 --> 02:18.520
Go back to bed, will ya?

02:24.680 --> 02:26.400
-Let us out!
-Come on!

02:26.440 --> 02:27.960
Come on!

02:30.960 --> 02:33.960
[woman]
Open the fucking doors!

02:34.000 --> 02:35.960
Ferals are restless.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.680
Sounds like they're tripping.

02:37.720 --> 02:39.200
Doubt it.

02:39.240 --> 02:41.000
Locked up for three days.

02:41.040 --> 02:42.800
Haven't moved
any bloody stock.

02:45.400 --> 02:47.520
-Do they always
carry on like this?
-No.

02:47.560 --> 02:51.560
We're just all going a bit
stir crazy with this lockdown.

02:51.600 --> 02:54.920
Certainly creates
a lot of pent-up aggression.

02:58.880 --> 03:01.000
Eventually that's
gotta go somewhere.

03:01.960 --> 03:04.200
[woman]
What are you doing, top dog?

03:04.240 --> 03:05.720
Fuckin' do something!

03:06.880 --> 03:08.960
You're fucking useless!

03:09.000 --> 03:10.760
You call yourself top dog!

03:13.240 --> 03:16.240
God, I am so over toast
and two-minute noodles.

03:16.280 --> 03:17.480
[woman]
Ya fuckin' screws!

03:17.520 --> 03:18.640
[Jake] Novak?

03:18.680 --> 03:20.000
Governor wants to see you.

03:23.760 --> 03:25.480
[woman]
What are you doing about it?

03:26.400 --> 03:27.960
Hey, hey, Mr. Stewart?

03:28.000 --> 03:29.280
How's Ms. Reynolds?

03:29.320 --> 03:30.920
[woman]
Fuckin' shithouse!

03:35.040 --> 03:36.680
Hey, why aren't
they talking to us?

03:37.720 --> 03:39.760
Boomer, what if
she's in a bad way?

03:39.800 --> 03:41.160
We should have just fessed up.

03:41.200 --> 03:42.480
It's too late for that now.

03:42.520 --> 03:44.160
Well, we should
at least tell Allie.

03:44.200 --> 03:45.520
And put her in a position
where she has to choose

03:45.560 --> 03:47.080
between us
and the other women?

03:47.120 --> 03:49.160
-Is that fair to her?
-They're going off.

03:49.200 --> 03:51.800
-Listen to them.
-Do you want to cop
an assault charge?

03:51.840 --> 03:53.000
No.

03:53.920 --> 03:55.000
No, I'll...

03:55.040 --> 03:56.880
I'll say that it was me.

03:56.920 --> 03:58.000
I bashed her.

03:58.040 --> 03:59.880
We'll keep Rubes out of it.

03:59.920 --> 04:02.040
-Boomer--
-Yes.

04:02.080 --> 04:05.000
They'll isolate you,
Boomer. They'll force you
to spill everything.

04:05.040 --> 04:07.560
How it's going to look
if it gets out now?

04:07.600 --> 04:10.120
We're in Allie's crew.
Everyone will blame her.

04:10.160 --> 04:12.880
We have to stay strong,
for Allie's sake.

04:16.560 --> 04:19.880
The hospital says she's stable,
but with the concussion,
a punctured lung

04:19.920 --> 04:22.320
and broken ribs,
they have to keep her
in for a few more days.

04:22.360 --> 04:24.360
Well, we can't maintain
this lockdown much longer.

04:24.400 --> 04:27.440
Well, we have to, until
we identify Ann's attacker.

04:27.480 --> 04:29.920
The police have come up
with nothing, Vera.

04:29.960 --> 04:31.240
Nobody's talking.

04:31.280 --> 04:33.360
Someone will crack,
eventually.

04:33.400 --> 04:35.800
Maybe they all thought
Ann had it coming.

04:35.840 --> 04:38.600
-Are you saying
she deserved it?
-Of course not.

04:38.640 --> 04:40.880
But, given all her cutbacks,

04:40.920 --> 04:42.400
I mean, are you really
surprised this has happened?

04:42.440 --> 04:43.480
[knock on door]

04:43.520 --> 04:44.920
Come in!

04:44.960 --> 04:46.400
-Got Novak.
-Thank you.

04:49.240 --> 04:50.720
You got a name for me yet?

04:50.760 --> 04:52.280
It is inhumane to keep us
locked down like this--

04:52.320 --> 04:54.280
Let's talk about inhumane,
shall we?

04:54.320 --> 04:57.120
-Without proper food,
rec time, showers--
-I will lift the lockdown

04:57.160 --> 04:58.760
when you give me
the GM's attacker.

04:58.800 --> 05:00.320
I've told you,
I don't know who it is.

05:00.360 --> 05:02.520
And even if you did,
you wouldn't lag.

05:02.560 --> 05:04.920
I would encourage
them to come forward
for the benefit of the women,

05:04.960 --> 05:07.440
but I can't do anything
if you keep us isolated.

05:10.840 --> 05:12.120
OK.

05:12.160 --> 05:14.480
I'll agree
to partial release.

05:14.520 --> 05:15.920
No phones.

05:15.960 --> 05:18.280
No visitors. No rec time.
No showers.

05:18.320 --> 05:21.480
You're allowed out to work
and eat, that is it.

05:21.520 --> 05:24.120
Mr. Stewart.
Can you tell the staff

05:24.160 --> 05:27.280
to prepare meal service
and morning work units, please?

05:27.320 --> 05:29.000
-That's not a compromise.
-It's not meant to be.

05:29.040 --> 05:31.200
Find out who put Ann Reynolds
in the hospital.

05:31.240 --> 05:33.040
That's the only way
this will end.

05:36.440 --> 05:38.160
[woman]
This is shit!

05:38.200 --> 05:39.520
Baked beans, this is it?

05:39.560 --> 05:41.880
Eat it, or pretend
it's Ramadan, Saad.

05:41.920 --> 05:43.040
Either way, clear the line.

05:43.080 --> 05:44.320
[Boomer] Oi!

05:44.360 --> 05:46.200
You should be thanking
your top dog.

05:46.240 --> 05:48.320
[woman]
Novak's done fuck-all.

05:48.360 --> 05:49.680
Jack shit.

05:49.720 --> 05:51.800
She's a useless
fuckin' top dog.

05:56.720 --> 05:58.520
[woman]
She's done fuck-all.

05:58.560 --> 05:59.840
What'd the Governor want?

05:59.880 --> 06:01.520
What do you think?
The GM's basher.

06:02.840 --> 06:03.960
Wants you to lag?

06:04.000 --> 06:05.400
Yeah, right, good luck.

06:05.440 --> 06:07.680
Does anyone
know if she's all right?

06:07.720 --> 06:09.360
Mr. Stewart said
she's gonna be fine.

06:12.040 --> 06:16.040
Hey, Allie, I was wondering
if I can use the phones
to call my Dad?

06:16.080 --> 06:18.320
Reckon they'll let us
access them?

06:18.360 --> 06:21.040
No phones, no visitors,
no rec time, no showers.

06:25.920 --> 06:27.360
What the shit!

06:27.400 --> 06:29.600
Bloody rats
have gnawed on 'em.

06:29.640 --> 06:30.960
They're disgusting!

06:31.000 --> 06:33.800
[woman]
Freak! Freak!

06:35.440 --> 06:36.760
Oi!

06:36.800 --> 06:38.360
[woman] You eat
the fuckin' rat food!

06:38.400 --> 06:40.160
Hold onto your buns, ladies.

06:40.200 --> 06:43.000
-Here ya go!
-See an officer
for some more rat baits.

06:43.040 --> 06:46.000
If they're good enough
for vermin, they're good
enough for you lot.

06:46.040 --> 06:48.080
What are we,
animals in a fuckin' zoo?

06:52.240 --> 06:54.000
-Jesus!
-Fuck!

06:57.400 --> 06:58.920
[Dr. Miller] Kath?

07:00.120 --> 07:01.560
Kath?

07:03.760 --> 07:04.960
Kath!

07:08.960 --> 07:10.280
You like fish?

07:14.840 --> 07:20.680
You know, neurologically
speaking, goldfish
are quite contentious.

07:24.600 --> 07:26.640
It's their memory.

07:26.680 --> 07:30.760
Some say that it
only lasts three seconds,
so every lap of the fish tank,

07:30.800 --> 07:33.720
it's like they're
discovering a brand-new world.

07:36.760 --> 07:38.520
Personally,
I think it's a myth.

07:38.560 --> 07:41.800
I think the truth is
they remember a lot more
than they let on.

07:41.840 --> 07:43.880
I don't want to continue
these sessions.

07:43.920 --> 07:45.680
I'm afraid
that's not an option.

07:45.720 --> 07:49.400
I have to give a report
on your mental state
at the committal

07:49.440 --> 07:51.600
into the murder
of the real Kath Maxwell.

07:51.640 --> 07:53.120
I'm Kath Maxwell.

07:53.160 --> 07:55.560
The court
has a different opinion.

07:55.600 --> 07:56.640
Well, I won't talk to you.

07:56.680 --> 07:58.160
I won't cooperate.

08:02.560 --> 08:03.760
Can I ask why?

08:05.000 --> 08:07.040
Joan Ferguson was a monster.

08:08.600 --> 08:10.120
Why would
I want to remember her?

08:11.000 --> 08:12.240
She was obviously...

08:18.760 --> 08:20.120
pure evil.

08:29.600 --> 08:33.680
I believe that we are
all born a blank slate.

08:35.240 --> 08:38.160
None of these kids
are inherently good, or bad.

08:40.040 --> 08:44.240
Whatever you know
about Joan Ferguson,
she wasn't born rotten.

08:44.280 --> 08:46.920
[voice becomes distant]
She was as innocent and pure

08:46.960 --> 08:49.120
as any of these children here.

08:53.760 --> 08:56.240
[distant, muffled voice] I came
to Wentworth with a mandate

08:56.280 --> 08:57.920
to cure recidivism.

08:59.880 --> 09:01.840
That mandate was revoked.

09:04.440 --> 09:08.800
But you, Kath, you present
a unique opportunity.

09:08.840 --> 09:11.760
Psychiatric medicine
still doesn't truly understand

09:11.800 --> 09:13.800
the psychopathic syndrome.

09:13.840 --> 09:16.080
If we could clear away the muck,
I know that I could--

09:16.120 --> 09:17.440
Whose baby is that?

09:20.240 --> 09:21.440
What?

09:22.800 --> 09:24.400
That baby.

09:28.280 --> 09:29.480
Whose is it?

09:32.320 --> 09:33.600
What's she doing here?

09:33.640 --> 09:35.560
-Get her out of there.
-Mr. Stewart--

09:35.600 --> 09:37.840
Get her out of here! Now!

09:40.960 --> 09:42.960
[Dr. Miller]<i> Calm down.</i>
<i>I meant no harm by it.</i>

09:43.000 --> 09:45.120
You took a prisoner
to the creche!

09:45.160 --> 09:48.600
To the corridor
outside the creche,
as part of her therapy.

09:48.640 --> 09:52.200
You do not use my child
as a therapeutic fucking tool.

09:52.240 --> 09:54.240
-This isn't
about your daughter.
-I don't care.

09:54.280 --> 09:56.040
You brought a prisoner
who's been charged with murder

09:56.080 --> 09:58.560
to a part of the prison that's
completely out of bounds!

09:58.600 --> 10:01.440
Yeah, I... I was wrong.

10:01.480 --> 10:03.720
I apologize.
It will not happen again.

10:06.480 --> 10:08.800
[door beeps]

10:08.840 --> 10:10.080
On your feet.

10:10.120 --> 10:11.920
I'm talking
you back to your unit.

10:13.920 --> 10:16.720

10:16.760 --> 10:18.400
<i>In breaking news,</i>

10:59.840 --> 11:01.520
Ferguson.

11:01.560 --> 11:04.720
Stay the fuck
away from my baby.

11:04.760 --> 11:06.960
That baby's yours?

11:09.360 --> 11:12.080
[woman]
Jesus, we all fucking stink!

11:12.120 --> 11:14.160
[inmates shouting]

11:17.040 --> 11:18.280
[woman] She stinks!

11:18.320 --> 11:21.680
[inmates shouting]

11:39.360 --> 11:40.360
He what?

11:40.400 --> 11:41.840
The creche corridor.

11:41.880 --> 11:43.840
She was five feet
away from Grace.

11:44.960 --> 11:46.440
Why would he do that?

11:46.480 --> 11:48.120
I was this close
to smashing him in the gob.

11:48.160 --> 11:51.440
He was using our baby
to jog that bitch's memory.

11:52.640 --> 11:54.400
Oh, OK.

11:54.440 --> 11:56.800
All right, so you're pissed off
at him because he was trying

11:56.840 --> 11:58.520
to cure Ferguson's amnesia.

11:58.560 --> 11:59.960
No.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.400
No, how can you
even think that?

12:01.440 --> 12:03.680
This is about Grace.

12:03.720 --> 12:05.040
OK. OK.

12:05.080 --> 12:06.680
He'll try and justify it.
Don't let him.

12:06.720 --> 12:08.360
Vera, I'm so sorry.

12:08.400 --> 12:10.040
I feel terrible,

12:10.080 --> 12:11.840
but there was never any
danger to any of the children.

12:11.880 --> 12:13.480
I would never
put your daughter's
safety in jeopardy.

12:13.520 --> 12:14.800
It's not just
about our daughter.

12:14.840 --> 12:16.000
It's about
doing what's right.

12:16.040 --> 12:17.520
OK, Jake.

12:17.560 --> 12:18.600
It's about having professional
standards, mate--

12:18.640 --> 12:20.400
All right, all right!

12:20.440 --> 12:22.720
He has apologized, and I'm sure
Dr. Miller won't do it again.

12:31.080 --> 12:33.800
Vera, I just got
an email from Corrections

12:33.840 --> 12:36.680
about one of the prisoners,
a Reb Keane?

12:36.720 --> 12:37.800
Yeah, what about them?

12:37.840 --> 12:40.160
It's about his top surgery.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.800
If you go near my baby again,
I'll kill you myself.

12:54.840 --> 12:56.400
Your baby?

12:56.440 --> 12:57.800
-I--
-[woman] Bullshit!

12:57.840 --> 13:00.120
[woman #2]
Jesus, hear her!

13:03.040 --> 13:04.400
[inmates shouting]

13:04.440 --> 13:05.680
Keane?

13:08.160 --> 13:11.400
Your request to apply for
top surgery has been granted.

13:12.680 --> 13:14.440
It's just an application
at this point,

13:14.480 --> 13:17.120
but apparently,
the General Manager
has approved the process.

13:17.160 --> 13:18.880
Oh, my God!

13:18.920 --> 13:20.640
Oh, my God,
that's amazing.

13:23.120 --> 13:24.600
OK.

13:24.640 --> 13:27.520
So you've just got
to get a tick from Dr. Miller

13:27.560 --> 13:28.640
to proceed to the next stage.

13:28.680 --> 13:29.960
Wait, what?

13:30.000 --> 13:31.920
We need his signature
on the application,

13:31.960 --> 13:35.160
so I'll set up
a session for you
after morning work unit.

13:39.160 --> 13:42.400
-Baby, that is so awesome!
-It's bullshit.

13:42.440 --> 13:44.760
Are you kidding me?
This is everything.
This is...

13:44.800 --> 13:47.440
This is what
we wanted. This...
It's gonna happen.

13:47.480 --> 13:48.680
I'm not seeing
that psych, Lou.

13:48.720 --> 13:50.440
I'm not having him
judge me.

13:50.480 --> 13:52.640
-It's not gonna be like that--
-Fuckin' bullshit! Yes, it will.

13:52.680 --> 13:54.040
-Of course it will.
-Hey, come on.

13:56.320 --> 13:59.840
I think it's just seeing
the news report this morning.

14:01.160 --> 14:03.840
I think it's upset you and...

14:03.880 --> 14:05.320
fuckin' fair enough.

14:07.360 --> 14:08.560
No. No.

14:10.160 --> 14:13.120
What's upset me is having
to jump through hoops

14:13.160 --> 14:15.080
to get some
therapist's approval.

14:15.120 --> 14:17.080
OK? I don't need--
I don't need a shrink
to tell me what I can

14:17.120 --> 14:18.640
and what I can't do
with my body!

14:18.680 --> 14:21.520
I know that.
I know that.

14:21.560 --> 14:25.680
That is just how these
fuckin' institutions work,
and we're stuck here.

14:27.640 --> 14:29.280
We have to play their game.

14:29.320 --> 14:31.640
[inmates shouting]

14:34.760 --> 14:36.760
Who do you think
they've arrested?

14:39.840 --> 14:41.880
Who cares?
I don't know.

14:43.520 --> 14:45.880
It doesn't matter,
'cause the only thing
that matters is that

14:45.920 --> 14:48.400
no one's connected us
to that place.

14:50.480 --> 14:52.240
And we don't talk
about it anymore.

14:54.480 --> 14:55.760
[knock on door]

14:57.040 --> 14:59.720
-I've got Keane.
-Thanks, Ms. Miles.

14:59.760 --> 15:01.280
Please, have a seat, Reb.

15:06.880 --> 15:11.960
So, you've applied
for chest surgery as
part of your transition.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.160
The government requires me
to sign off on it.

15:14.200 --> 15:17.280
They just want to make
sure that your decision is
a rational one, yeah?

15:17.320 --> 15:19.920
Mate, I'm trans,
not psychotic.

15:19.960 --> 15:21.240
Yeah, of course.

15:21.280 --> 15:23.400
It's just,
it's standard criteria

15:23.440 --> 15:25.280
that I'm required
to cover, OK?

15:25.320 --> 15:29.800
So, how old were
you when you started
to identify as male?

15:29.840 --> 15:32.120
Six or seven.

15:32.160 --> 15:34.560
Did you start to dress
like a boy at that age as well?

15:34.600 --> 15:36.640
No, um...

15:36.680 --> 15:38.280
my mum wouldn't let me.

15:38.320 --> 15:40.200
When did you start
testosterone?

15:40.240 --> 15:42.160
[amplified scribbling sound]

15:43.880 --> 15:46.160
About twelve months ago,
I think.

15:47.680 --> 15:50.920
I was just in denial
before that.

15:50.960 --> 15:53.080
Let my mum
control me and stuff.

15:54.120 --> 15:56.000
Control you how?

15:56.040 --> 15:57.320
[echoing voice]
Where's your penis?
You don't have one, do you?

15:57.360 --> 16:01.160
She...
she sent me to a clinic.

16:01.200 --> 16:03.880
Right, and were you
offered a diagnosis?

16:03.920 --> 16:05.800
[sad chuckle]

16:05.840 --> 16:09.120
Um... body dysmorphia.

16:09.160 --> 16:11.240
[echoing voice]
Why do you hate your body?

16:11.280 --> 16:12.800
How do you feel
about your body?

16:12.840 --> 16:14.800
It's a beautiful body.
You should love your body.

16:14.840 --> 16:16.080
Shouldn't she?

16:16.120 --> 16:19.160
Love your body, Rebecca.
It's godly.

16:19.200 --> 16:21.840
-<i> You were made in God's image.</i>
-You were born a girl.

16:21.880 --> 16:23.520
Have you ever had
an eating disorder?

16:23.560 --> 16:25.400
-You have breasts.
-Suffered from depression?

16:25.440 --> 16:27.920
-You have a womb.
-Anxiety or substance abuse?

16:27.960 --> 16:30.360
Your hips were built
for child-bearing.

16:30.400 --> 16:32.240
Have you ever
contemplated suicide?

16:32.280 --> 16:34.480
-Why don't you want to be here?
-Reb, please, just talk to me.

16:34.520 --> 16:35.640
Well, I don't know
what you want me to say.

16:35.680 --> 16:38.040
Admit to me,
you're confused.

16:38.080 --> 16:40.400
-Fuck!
-Hey, Reb. Reb!

16:40.440 --> 16:41.600
Reb--

16:41.640 --> 16:44.440
Get your fuckin'
hands off me!

16:44.480 --> 16:46.760
You sick fuck!

16:51.360 --> 16:53.640
You're lucky Miller's
a soft cock.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.480
If it was up to me,
I'd slot you.

16:56.920 --> 16:58.560
What happened
with Dr. Miller?

16:58.600 --> 17:00.520
Dick girl lost her shit.

17:00.560 --> 17:01.880
[inmates shouting]

17:01.920 --> 17:03.080
Hey.

17:04.840 --> 17:06.160
Hey, what's going on?

17:07.040 --> 17:08.920
Reb, can I do
anything for you?

17:08.960 --> 17:11.600
Yeah, can you just...
Can you close the fuckin' door?

17:13.000 --> 17:14.840
Hey, come on.

17:14.880 --> 17:17.360
Hey, you're safe.
I'm here.

17:17.400 --> 17:18.680
No one's gonna hurt you.

17:18.720 --> 17:21.080
-Just tell me what happened--
-Fuck!

17:21.120 --> 17:22.320
Fuck!

17:22.360 --> 17:23.800
Fuck!

17:23.840 --> 17:25.440
I'm not going
back to him, Lou.

17:25.480 --> 17:27.440
-I am not.
-OK, can you tell me
what happened?

17:27.480 --> 17:29.480
It was just like
I was back there!

17:29.520 --> 17:31.920
You know, he was so,
so like him and it was...

17:31.960 --> 17:34.120
it was the same questions.

17:34.160 --> 17:37.760
He was going on
with that fuckin' body
dysmorphia bullshit, and I...

17:37.800 --> 17:39.240
I just hit him.

17:39.280 --> 17:41.200
I don't know what happened.
I just...

17:41.240 --> 17:43.000
I lashed out,
and I hit him,

17:43.040 --> 17:44.680
and like, that's it now,
you know?

17:44.720 --> 17:46.440
Like, I have fucked it.

17:46.480 --> 17:48.760
-You haven't--
-No, I have fucked it, Lou.

17:48.800 --> 17:51.040
All right. OK.

17:51.080 --> 17:53.760
He thinks I'm a nut case,
and he is never, ever gonna
sign off on my surgery now.

17:53.800 --> 17:55.760
-Do you understand?
-Hey, it's gonna be all right.

17:55.800 --> 17:57.440
-Fuck off.
-OK! Hey!

18:02.120 --> 18:04.560
I can fix this.

18:04.600 --> 18:06.760
I can fix this for you, OK?

18:08.360 --> 18:10.040
I just don't think
you can fix this one, babe.

18:10.080 --> 18:11.040
Hey, come on.

18:11.080 --> 18:14.720
[inmates shouting]

18:14.760 --> 18:16.280
Do you trust me?

18:30.280 --> 18:32.720
[woman on PA]
<i>Attention compound,</i>
<i>attention compound.</i>

18:32.760 --> 18:35.240
<i>All women to report</i>
<i>to assigned work duties.</i>

18:35.280 --> 18:37.720
[inmates cheering]

18:41.200 --> 18:43.560
Dr. Miller, I'm Lou Kelly.

18:43.600 --> 18:45.040
Yes, I know who you are.

18:45.080 --> 18:46.520
Mm-hmm.

18:46.560 --> 18:49.920
Do you know how long
Reb's waited for this surgery?

18:49.960 --> 18:51.720
What he's had to go
through to get here?

18:53.000 --> 18:54.520
You can't deny him this.

18:55.560 --> 18:56.880
That's not my intention.

18:56.920 --> 18:59.240
OK, good.
So you will sign off on it?

19:03.360 --> 19:05.480
He just wants to take
ownership of his own body.

19:05.520 --> 19:08.040
Yes, and I can't approve
the procedure

19:08.080 --> 19:09.680
until I'm satisfied

19:09.720 --> 19:12.560
that Reb is psychologically
in good health.

19:12.600 --> 19:14.200
Fuck.

19:14.240 --> 19:17.520
It's just meant to be
a formality, Miller.

19:17.560 --> 19:20.520
Can you just tick
the fucking box?

19:20.560 --> 19:21.920
Kelly!

19:21.960 --> 19:23.560
Back to your mopping.

19:34.200 --> 19:37.160
We got a rat in our unit.

19:37.200 --> 19:40.280
Go get me some of that
rat bait that's been laying
around the kitchen.

19:41.200 --> 19:42.560
Mm-hmm?

19:49.600 --> 19:51.200
[overlapping telephone chatter]

19:51.240 --> 19:53.720
[woman] Can I ask who your
current internet provider is?

19:57.120 --> 19:58.440
Come on, Rita.

19:58.480 --> 19:59.720
[woman]
Can you hear me now?

20:01.520 --> 20:02.800
Who're you trying to call?

20:02.840 --> 20:04.560
No, no one. I'm...
I was just getting--

20:04.600 --> 20:07.000
One more stuff-up,
Mitchell, and you're gone.

20:07.040 --> 20:08.920
[woman] What made you
choose this provider?

20:08.960 --> 20:12.360
-<i> Hello?</i>
-Hi, Gavin.

20:12.400 --> 20:15.920
It's Susan calling
from Maynard Market Research.

20:15.960 --> 20:17.560
<i>Susan!</i>

20:17.600 --> 20:20.120
<i>I was starting to think</i>
<i>you'd forgotten about me.</i>

20:20.160 --> 20:21.400
Were ya?

20:21.440 --> 20:24.920
Yeah, nah, I just been
busy doing...

20:25.360 --> 20:26.680
stuff.

20:26.720 --> 20:28.480
<i>It's bloody great</i>
<i>to hear from you.</i>

20:28.520 --> 20:32.160
<i>You know, I've hardly</i>
<i>stopped thinking about you.</i>

Novak?

20:35.840 --> 20:37.240
A word, please.

20:37.280 --> 20:40.560
I've been thinking
a bit about you too, a bit.

20:40.600 --> 20:43.280
[woman] I can offer you a number
of different plans and...

20:44.280 --> 20:45.440
Well?

20:45.480 --> 20:47.040
I haven't heard anything.

20:47.080 --> 20:49.240
Are you losing their respect?

20:51.440 --> 20:54.200
The women always look up
to the top dog when
things get bad.

20:54.240 --> 20:55.440
It's only going
to get worse for you, Allie.

20:55.480 --> 20:57.400
Tell me something
I don't know.

20:57.440 --> 20:59.640
Whatever you have to do

20:59.680 --> 21:01.040
to convince
Ann Reynolds' attacker

21:01.080 --> 21:03.040
to come forward,
I suggest you do it.

21:07.200 --> 21:09.840
[Boomer] So, like,
what's most important to you?

21:09.880 --> 21:13.680
Is it looks, boob size,
or personality?

21:13.720 --> 21:16.320
<i>This isn't about laundry</i>
<i>detergent, is it?</i>

21:16.360 --> 21:18.240
[laughter]

21:18.280 --> 21:20.760
<i>I'd say... honesty.</i>

21:20.800 --> 21:23.000
No, no, no, no, that's
not one of the options.

21:23.040 --> 21:25.120
<i>No, I've been</i>
<i>hurt too many times.</i>

21:25.160 --> 21:28.040
<i>Honesty is my number-one</i>
<i>non-negotiable.</i>

21:33.320 --> 21:35.160
<i>Susan?</i>

21:35.200 --> 21:37.760
-<i> Hey, I--</i>
-No, I'm here.

21:37.800 --> 21:39.200
<i>What's up?</i>

21:41.720 --> 21:47.280
I-- I haven't been
totally honest with ya.

21:47.320 --> 21:48.560
<i>Right.</i>

21:50.200 --> 21:53.600
Truth is, I'm in prison.

21:55.120 --> 21:57.720
This whole call center
is part of its industries.

21:57.760 --> 21:59.120
Pro... pulse.

21:59.160 --> 22:00.800
How long have you been
with this provider?

22:00.840 --> 22:03.280
-I'm calling Grossa Marca...
-Does that turn you off?

22:07.280 --> 22:08.520
<i>Not really.</i>

22:09.480 --> 22:11.160
-You serious?
<i>-Yeah.</i>

22:11.200 --> 22:14.120
<i>But everything else</i>
<i>you said, is that true?</i>

22:14.160 --> 22:16.040
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I'm totally hot.

22:16.080 --> 22:18.400
<i>Cool.</i>
<i>Hey, I've always wanted</i>

22:18.440 --> 22:21.360
<i>a hot prison bitch pen pal.</i>

22:21.400 --> 22:22.440
Pen pal.

22:22.480 --> 22:24.560
[laughing]

22:24.600 --> 22:25.760
Cool.

22:32.200 --> 22:33.680
Jeez!

22:33.720 --> 22:35.640
Oh. Sorry.

22:39.600 --> 22:41.640
I'm sorry what happened
with Miller. I...

22:43.160 --> 22:45.040
Well, I thought
he was a good guy.

22:45.080 --> 22:49.440
He...
he genuinely helped me.

22:50.240 --> 22:52.040
Look, um...

22:53.440 --> 22:56.400
It probably
wasn't all his fault.

22:59.200 --> 23:00.880
Hey, did you see that, um,

23:00.920 --> 23:03.600
that report on the news
this morning,

23:03.640 --> 23:06.240
about
the True Paths Retreat?

23:07.320 --> 23:09.000
Where all those people died?

23:10.360 --> 23:12.280
Yeah, it was the clinic
I told you about.

23:13.520 --> 23:14.680
Where I met Lou.

23:16.120 --> 23:19.840
It was run
by this weird dude.

23:19.880 --> 23:23.080
He called himself a doctor,
but fuck knows what
he was a doctor of.

23:24.080 --> 23:26.160
He tried to get
inside people's heads.

23:26.200 --> 23:28.960
You know, like, made me
think that I was...

23:29.000 --> 23:30.200
I was broken.

23:31.360 --> 23:32.880
And I needed fixing.

23:36.080 --> 23:39.920
Is it true
there was a mass suicide?

23:42.960 --> 23:47.360
Shit got, um,
pretty crazy in the end.

23:47.400 --> 23:50.040
Me and Lou were
the only ones who made it
out of there alive.

23:55.200 --> 23:56.360
Shit.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.440
I'll drop these off
in the laundry.

24:04.480 --> 24:05.640
OK.

25:40.680 --> 25:42.200
Ferguson?

25:42.240 --> 25:44.160
You done?

25:48.560 --> 25:49.840
Come on!

25:53.280 --> 25:55.000
[inmates shouting]

25:55.040 --> 25:57.920
So hot phone guy wants
to become hot pen pal.

25:57.960 --> 26:00.280
[woman]
You call yourself top dog!

26:00.320 --> 26:02.200
So, like, he's gonna
write me dirty letters,

26:02.240 --> 26:05.520
and I'm gonna write
him dirty letters.

26:05.560 --> 26:08.440
Might need some help
with the spelling but, hey.

26:09.320 --> 26:10.760
[woman]
You're no fucking good!

26:10.800 --> 26:13.000
There's gonna be
a full-on riot.

26:13.040 --> 26:15.360
Lou Kelly's giving out acid
like she's Santa Claus.

26:15.400 --> 26:16.680
She's stirring up shit.

26:16.720 --> 26:19.480
Allie's gonna cop
the brunt of all this.

26:19.520 --> 26:21.080
We gotta say something.

26:22.640 --> 26:23.960
You're right.

26:29.120 --> 26:31.120
I know who
bashed Ann Reynolds.

26:33.800 --> 26:35.680
What?

26:35.720 --> 26:38.320
I didn't say anything before
because I wasn't up to speed

26:38.360 --> 26:40.440
on these mysterious
lagging rules.

26:40.480 --> 26:42.320
But Ruby set me straight.

26:42.360 --> 26:44.120
It's not lagging telling you.

26:45.720 --> 26:47.840
Who was it?

26:47.880 --> 26:49.640
Around the time
Ann Reynolds was bashed,

26:49.680 --> 26:52.480
I saw Lou Kelly
coming out of the kitchen.

26:56.120 --> 26:58.080
So if the only way
to lift this lockdown

26:58.120 --> 27:01.600
is to tell
Mr. Jackson who did it,

27:01.640 --> 27:04.440
then fuck it. Just tell him.

27:08.280 --> 27:10.840
[inmates shouting]

27:12.040 --> 27:14.920
[woman]
Big fuckin' bird!

27:49.520 --> 27:50.720
Here we go.

28:01.080 --> 28:02.280
Hey, Kath.

28:04.160 --> 28:08.200
You got that session
with Dr. Miller tomorrow?

28:08.240 --> 28:13.680
When he's not looking,
will you just pop this
in his cup of tea for me?

28:14.600 --> 28:15.800
What is it?

28:16.840 --> 28:18.640
Strychnine.

28:18.680 --> 28:21.040
That's from that
rat bait that you got for me.

28:22.120 --> 28:24.480
I can't.

28:24.520 --> 28:25.680
Yeah, you can.

28:25.720 --> 28:27.520
It will kill him.

28:27.560 --> 28:30.000
Yeah, well, maybe,
or it might just make him
really fuckin' sick.

28:31.160 --> 28:33.160
Either way,
we get a new shrink.

28:35.600 --> 28:36.800
Look.

28:38.480 --> 28:40.560
You're a psychopath.

28:40.600 --> 28:42.160
-No, I'm not.
-Get with the program.

28:42.200 --> 28:44.360
I'm not. Please.

28:45.480 --> 28:48.800
I am not that person anymore.

28:51.120 --> 28:54.400
Well, you're just gonna have
to hook into those impulses.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.240
Trust me,
they're down there.

29:15.920 --> 29:19.320
[indistinct chatter]

29:22.680 --> 29:24.440
Kelly.

29:24.480 --> 29:26.400
This isn't the bean
flickers' coffee club.

29:26.440 --> 29:27.320
Stay in your seat.

29:27.360 --> 29:29.080
Pity.
[laughter]

29:29.120 --> 29:32.160
Oh, come on, I'm just
making sure the girls are OK.

29:32.200 --> 29:34.080
Someone here
has to give a shit.

29:44.240 --> 29:46.440
Smug bitch
deserves to go down.

29:47.760 --> 29:49.360
Lagging's pretty serious.

29:55.280 --> 29:56.920
All right, everybody,
listen up.

29:58.480 --> 30:00.160
I'm only gonna say this once.

30:00.200 --> 30:03.480
Whoever bashed Ann Reynolds,

30:03.520 --> 30:05.120
I want you to turn yourself in.

30:05.160 --> 30:06.760
[scoffing laughter]

30:06.800 --> 30:10.560
For the sake of all the women,
do the right thing.

30:33.280 --> 30:35.080
Just a little heads-up.

30:35.120 --> 30:37.960
I'd think twice
about seeing Dr. Miller.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
He killed
another prisoner in here.

30:40.040 --> 30:41.400
Liz Birdsworth.

30:41.440 --> 30:43.480
Yeah.

30:43.520 --> 30:45.720
Might not have been
with his own hands, but he
wrongly medicated her,

30:45.760 --> 30:50.080
which drove her crazy
and caused her to have
a massive stroke.

31:02.560 --> 31:04.000
I've just heard
from Ms. Miles

31:04.040 --> 31:05.880
that you're refusing
to see Dr. Miller.

31:07.840 --> 31:10.600
Well, the sessions
are compulsory, Joan.
You know that.

31:11.880 --> 31:13.760
You know,
I would have thought
seeing Miller would suit

31:13.800 --> 31:15.880
this ridiculous charade
of yours.

31:15.920 --> 31:17.840
Why won't you see him?

31:18.720 --> 31:21.520
I heard some unsettling news.

31:21.560 --> 31:25.960
Regarding a prisoner
whose death Dr. Miller
was responsible for.

31:27.000 --> 31:28.160
All right.

31:29.160 --> 31:30.440
Which prisoner?

31:31.280 --> 31:33.280
Liz Birdsville.

31:33.320 --> 31:35.240
What the hell
are you playing at?

31:35.280 --> 31:37.240
It's called
running interference.

31:37.280 --> 31:38.520
It is called
being a dickhead.

31:38.560 --> 31:39.880
You don't get it, Vera.

31:39.920 --> 31:41.520
You are playing with fire.

31:41.560 --> 31:43.920
I'm trying to protect
our future. Grace's future.

31:43.960 --> 31:45.600
We can't let Miller treat her.

31:45.640 --> 31:47.760
-We can't let Ferguson
get away with this.
-Yes!

31:47.800 --> 31:49.440
We can.

31:49.480 --> 31:52.000
If it gets us off the hook,
we can, Vera. We have to.

31:55.040 --> 31:57.840
[inmates shouting]

32:24.040 --> 32:26.680
Joan Ferguson is dead,

32:26.720 --> 32:29.360
and you cannot convince
me otherwise.

32:30.440 --> 32:32.200
Let her be, Lou.

32:32.240 --> 32:34.480
Now I know what
you were trying to do.

32:34.520 --> 32:37.480
You cannot expect Kath
to commit murder for you.

32:37.520 --> 32:41.880
Why don't you just shut
your ungrateful fucking mouth.

32:41.920 --> 32:45.200
The only reason that you
and Kath are still breathing

32:45.240 --> 32:50.200
is 'cause I am
your fucking babysitter!

32:54.760 --> 32:58.440
You will see Miller
this morning.

32:58.480 --> 33:01.680
You will put rat poison
in his fuckin' Earl Grey.

33:03.280 --> 33:06.840
'Cause if you don't,
how long do you reckon it'll be

33:06.880 --> 33:10.560
before they string you back up
on that basketball ring?

33:11.720 --> 33:15.120
[imitates gasping]

33:32.240 --> 33:33.800
It's quiet in here.

33:37.520 --> 33:40.120
Go down this list of numbers
here, and when they answer,

33:40.160 --> 33:42.600
-you start with
the script there. Got it?
-Yep.

33:43.600 --> 33:45.120
Just double-click.

33:46.120 --> 33:47.280
[Dr. Miller] Yes.

33:49.240 --> 33:50.560
Kath.

33:50.600 --> 33:52.080
Better late than never.

33:52.120 --> 33:54.440
Please, take a seat.

33:56.680 --> 33:58.560
I'm really glad
you had a change of heart.

33:59.640 --> 34:02.320
I was just about
to make myself a cup of tea.

34:19.840 --> 34:21.640
Youse are allowed to talk.

34:37.760 --> 34:40.240
[exaggerated ticking]

34:55.400 --> 34:57.720
Get her in.
Get her swipe card!

34:57.760 --> 34:59.440
No, just fuckin' let her go!

34:59.480 --> 35:00.880
-Hey, hey!
-Let her go!

35:00.920 --> 35:01.920
Lou, what are you doing?

35:01.960 --> 35:03.560
Come on, Suzie Booms.

35:03.600 --> 35:05.280
We're just trying
to have a little bit of fun!

there's some unresolved
