00:11.417 --> 00:12.875
Hey, Mom-Mom.

00:12.959 --> 00:15.875
Uh, Clem comes to you
for therapy, right?

00:15.959 --> 00:18.625
Sweetheart, I can't reveal
who my patients are.

00:18.709 --> 00:20.542
-Hey, Tyler.
-Hi.

00:20.625 --> 00:21.834
Uh, Joan, I'm ready for therapy.

00:21.917 --> 00:22.959
Okay.

00:23.959 --> 00:26.041
I still acknowledge nothing.

00:26.125 --> 00:27.375
You have to help me out.

00:27.458 --> 00:28.917
Splitting up was a huge mistake.

00:29.000 --> 00:30.834
I love Clementine,
and I just want her back.

00:30.917 --> 00:31.875
Tell her.

00:31.959 --> 00:32.917
-I...
-I say that

00:33.000 --> 00:34.250
as your grandmother,

00:34.333 --> 00:35.792
not as her therapist,

00:35.875 --> 00:37.917
-which I may or may not be.
-I can't.

00:38.000 --> 00:39.583
I need to know
if she still feels the same way

00:39.667 --> 00:40.667
before I open up.

00:40.750 --> 00:42.542
Don't you think
it's worth a gamble?

00:42.625 --> 00:44.375
I say that
not as your grandmother,

00:44.458 --> 00:45.542
but as a gambler.

00:46.417 --> 00:47.542
Uh...
(sighs)

00:47.625 --> 00:48.917
JOHN:
Psst.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.041
I know how
to solve your problem.

00:52.125 --> 00:54.375
Just go take a good pee.

00:54.458 --> 00:56.917
What's the difference between
a good pee and a bad pee?

00:57.000 --> 00:59.333
Well, if you have to ask,
you're one of the lucky ones.

00:59.417 --> 01:00.917
Just go to the bathroom.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.083
I don't need to go.

01:02.166 --> 01:03.333
You millennials think

01:03.417 --> 01:04.750
you always know everything.

01:04.834 --> 01:06.834
If I tell you
to go to the bathroom,

01:06.917 --> 01:08.959
go to the bathroom.

01:09.041 --> 01:10.667
Well, you've been talking
so long

01:10.750 --> 01:12.834
-that I kind of do have to go.
-Mm-hmm.

01:18.709 --> 01:21.083
JOAN:
I know you're holding so much
inside you.

01:21.166 --> 01:22.542
Can you let it out?

01:22.625 --> 01:23.792
(Clementine sighs)

01:23.875 --> 01:25.792
See if you can let it out,
honey.

01:25.875 --> 01:27.750
(sighs)

01:27.834 --> 01:30.417
I'm still struggling
with our breakup.

01:30.500 --> 01:33.959
Tyler is my best friend.

01:34.041 --> 01:36.250
He's just so sweet
and sensitive.

01:36.333 --> 01:37.625
Yes, dear. No matter what,

01:37.709 --> 01:39.959
you always keep a soft spot
for your first love.

01:40.834 --> 01:42.125
Mine was a war criminal,

01:42.208 --> 01:44.458
and I still smile
when I think about him.

01:44.542 --> 01:45.917
Was he nice?

01:46.000 --> 01:47.959
No, dear. He was a war criminal.

01:48.041 --> 01:50.250
Oh. The one that got away.

01:50.333 --> 01:52.291
-No, he was hanged.
-Oh.

01:52.375 --> 01:53.792
As a war criminal.

01:53.875 --> 01:55.417
Oh, but we had fun.

01:55.500 --> 01:56.917
That's what I want.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.583
I want to have fun,
but every time

01:58.667 --> 02:01.000
I think I'm ready
to move on from Tyler, I...

02:01.083 --> 02:03.208
catch a glimpse of him
without his shirt on.

02:03.291 --> 02:07.041
His body is so milky white
and...

02:07.125 --> 02:08.959
he's got these two
new chest hairs.

02:09.041 --> 02:12.250
Like little sexy spider legs
waving hello.

02:13.291 --> 02:15.917
Wait till she sees number three.

02:17.792 --> 02:20.166
-(laughing)
-Nobody got me a beer?

02:20.250 --> 02:21.625
How come I didn't get a beer?

02:21.709 --> 02:23.125
No, I don't want it.

02:23.208 --> 02:25.041
HEATHER:
Oh, Tim. See, look at Tyler.

02:25.125 --> 02:28.041
That's the same color white
that I want my teeth to be.

02:28.125 --> 02:30.333
Oh, sorry. I was just lifting,

02:30.417 --> 02:32.959
and now my shirt won't fit,
so...

02:33.041 --> 02:34.709
Why are your nipples so hard?

02:34.792 --> 02:35.875
Doesn't that hurt?

02:35.959 --> 02:37.208
-Uh...
-Oh!

02:37.291 --> 02:39.208
Tyler.

02:39.291 --> 02:41.333
Here's an afghan.

02:41.417 --> 02:44.500
Uh, am I still allowed
to call it an afghan?

02:44.583 --> 02:46.792
Joan, could I talk to you
in your office for a second?

02:46.875 --> 02:48.458
-Sure.
-Uh, maybe

02:48.542 --> 02:49.875
you should do that
someplace else.

02:49.959 --> 02:52.291
Maybe someone
goes in there to fart.

02:52.375 --> 02:55.041
SOPHIA:
Dad.

02:55.125 --> 02:57.834
(groans)

02:57.917 --> 02:59.458
Oh.

02:59.542 --> 03:01.875
I cannot believe that you
told Tyler what I said.

03:01.959 --> 03:04.709
What happened to
doctor-patient confederacy?

03:04.792 --> 03:06.125
Honey, I would never
tell anything

03:06.208 --> 03:08.041
you told me as a patient.

03:08.125 --> 03:10.041
What, so it's just a coincidence
that Tyler decided

03:10.125 --> 03:11.750
to show up without his shirt on?

03:11.834 --> 03:13.834
God, you're so lucky
you're related to him.

03:13.917 --> 03:15.500
You can probably resist it.

03:15.583 --> 03:17.125
Yeah.

03:17.208 --> 03:18.625
I don't know how to explain it.

03:18.709 --> 03:20.625
He-he just came
without his shirt.

03:20.709 --> 03:22.750
(knocking on door)

03:24.041 --> 03:25.959
(door closes)

03:26.041 --> 03:28.875
(toilet whirring)

03:28.959 --> 03:30.208
Tyler?

03:30.291 --> 03:32.917
Someone's in here.

03:34.333 --> 03:36.875
You know what,
I still can't understand

03:36.959 --> 03:39.959
how Tyler overheard
my therapy session.

03:40.041 --> 03:41.875
Well, I told him to go pee.

03:41.959 --> 03:43.750
You can hear through the vent.

03:43.834 --> 03:46.041
You can hear my sessions
through the vent?

03:46.125 --> 03:49.458
-Yeah, uh, because I knew
you couldn't tell Tyler about
-(gasps)

03:49.542 --> 03:51.750
Tangerine's feelings,
so I did it for you.

03:51.834 --> 03:55.250
Because we have
that unspoken agreement.

03:55.333 --> 03:56.834
What agreement?

03:56.917 --> 03:59.166
Well, the one
where you won't do things

03:59.250 --> 04:02.333
that are against the rules,
so I do 'em for you.

04:02.417 --> 04:03.875
I don't know what
you're talking about.

04:03.959 --> 04:06.250
The perfect crime.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.583
Honey, I know this is strange,
but I need you to go

04:10.667 --> 04:12.583
into the bathroom
and stay there.

04:12.667 --> 04:15.250
Oh.
I've gotten this request before.

04:15.333 --> 04:19.166
Oh. We've got a lot of ground
to cover.

04:21.625 --> 04:24.125
Oh. Here's the problem, Mom-Mom.
Your computer was off.

04:24.208 --> 04:25.917
Oh. "Off" buttons.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.125
-Hmm.
-Honey, while I have you, dear,

04:28.208 --> 04:30.542
are you still in love
with Clementine?

04:30.625 --> 04:32.834
I think you know
the answer to that.

04:32.917 --> 04:34.750
I'd like to hear you say it.

04:34.834 --> 04:36.166
Why? That's weird.

04:36.250 --> 04:38.208
Say it, damn it.

04:38.291 --> 04:40.834
I love her. I love her so much.

04:40.917 --> 04:44.083
And you realize that you
made a horrendous mistake

04:44.166 --> 04:47.166
and that you wish you
could take it all back?

04:48.041 --> 04:49.208
Say it.

04:49.291 --> 04:51.208
Don't make me pinch you.

04:51.291 --> 04:54.959
Okay! It was the worst mistake
of my life. I'm so stupid.

04:55.041 --> 04:57.083
I'm an idiot.
I'm a stupid idiot.

04:57.166 --> 04:58.917
My dad and all my high school
friends were right.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.166
She was too good for me.
And now I'm gonna die alone,

05:01.250 --> 05:02.750
and she's gonna have
a million babies without me!

05:02.834 --> 05:05.166
All right, all right,
all right. We-we got the gist.

05:05.250 --> 05:06.667
Why are you being so mean?

05:06.750 --> 05:08.750
I, uh...

05:08.834 --> 05:10.959
I really thought
she'd be here by now.

05:11.041 --> 05:12.875
Who? Samantha?
I wasn't doing anything.

05:12.959 --> 05:14.208
Tyler...

05:15.834 --> 05:17.625
I love you, too.

05:23.875 --> 05:27.458
(panting)

05:27.542 --> 05:30.333
Not on the desk!

05:32.959 --> 05:37.458
Tim! Tim,
you got another ticket?

05:37.542 --> 05:41.125
Impossible. I am nothing if
not an incredibly safe driver.

05:43.667 --> 05:45.375
-Oh, man.
-Yeah.

05:45.458 --> 05:47.291
(scoffs) You always have
to tell me if you have proof

05:47.375 --> 05:48.875
<i>before </i>you accuse me.

05:48.959 --> 05:50.458
Then that way,
I don't have to lie to you.

05:50.542 --> 05:52.208
Come on, babe,
we've talked about this.

05:52.291 --> 05:54.709
We are already on
my parents' car insurance, babe.

05:54.792 --> 05:57.583
There is nowhere for us
to go after this.

05:57.667 --> 05:59.500
Relax. I'll do
Internet traffic school.

05:59.583 --> 06:01.125
And like everything I do online,

06:01.208 --> 06:03.625
I'll bang it out in two seconds.

06:04.583 --> 06:05.917
MERGIN:
<i>Well parked, young wizard!</i>

06:06.000 --> 06:07.500
<i>On to the next magical lesson!</i>

06:07.583 --> 06:09.000
Oh, I hate this.

06:09.083 --> 06:11.041
Why is this traffic
school wizard-themed?

06:11.125 --> 06:14.041
Everybody knows wizards don't
drive; they ride eagles!

06:14.125 --> 06:15.750
<i>How many wands</i>
<i>away from the curb</i>

06:15.834 --> 06:17.291
<i>shall ye park your chariot?</i>

06:17.375 --> 06:19.917
<i>-In inches?</i>
-How am I supposed to know?

06:20.000 --> 06:21.750
I only learned it in wands!

06:21.834 --> 06:22.959
It's 18 inches.

06:23.041 --> 06:24.709
That's as good a guess as any.

06:24.792 --> 06:25.750
(types)

06:25.834 --> 06:27.750
Hey, you were right!
Who told you that?

06:27.834 --> 06:30.417
Mergin the Driving Wizard.
Aren't you listening?

06:30.500 --> 06:33.166
He said it when he brought that
motorcycle rider back to life.

06:33.250 --> 06:35.166
Hey, you know what?

06:36.542 --> 06:38.000
If you can finish this test
for me,

06:38.083 --> 06:40.583
I just might be able
to turn Tyler's old car

06:40.667 --> 06:42.333
into Sam's new car.

06:42.417 --> 06:44.208
What's Tyler going to use?

06:44.291 --> 06:47.166
(scoffs, chuckles)
He's got nowhere to go.

06:47.250 --> 06:48.291
(chuckles):
Yeah.

06:51.375 --> 06:52.667
Okay, Soph,
enough with the slime.

06:52.750 --> 06:54.291
You got to get going
on your homework.

06:54.375 --> 06:55.792
I'm having Beverly do it for me.

06:55.875 --> 06:57.792
She's desperate for my approval,

06:57.875 --> 07:00.458
and I'm embarrassed
how much I've been withholding.

07:00.542 --> 07:02.208
Sweetie, you can't do that.
You can't just pawn

07:02.291 --> 07:04.000
your work off on someone else.

07:04.083 --> 07:06.166
That's what you'd think,
but I saw Sam taking

07:06.250 --> 07:09.542
Dad's driving test for him,
so I figured anything goes.

07:09.625 --> 07:12.917
(laughs):
Okay, honey,
your dad would never do that.

07:13.000 --> 07:13.959
Of course I did that.

07:14.041 --> 07:15.583
-Oh, Tim!
-All right, no one

07:15.667 --> 07:17.959
actually knows where a
wizard gets his power from.

07:18.083 --> 07:20.250
So I guess we're gonna have to
go to the dark web to find out.

07:20.333 --> 07:22.166
I can't believe
that you are teaching

07:22.250 --> 07:23.834
our daughter it's okay to cheat.

07:23.917 --> 07:25.166
Well, you cheat all the time!

07:25.250 --> 07:26.208
-What?
-Dad's just

07:26.291 --> 07:27.792
teaching me about priorities.

07:27.875 --> 07:29.917
Don't forget about bribery, too.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.166
Okay, you know what, no.

07:31.250 --> 07:34.917
Sam, we're hypocrites, okay?

07:35.000 --> 07:36.709
But you're-you're better
than that.

07:36.792 --> 07:39.875
You're a good kid. I know this!
I read it in your diary.

07:39.959 --> 07:41.041
You read my diary?

07:41.125 --> 07:44.458
Yes. Because we are
terrible people, okay?

07:44.542 --> 07:46.458
But it's not too late for you.

07:46.542 --> 07:48.458
And you were right, Sam.

07:48.542 --> 07:51.250
Everything <i>can </i>change
over the summer.

07:51.333 --> 07:53.500
-Mm.
-Oh, my God.

07:53.583 --> 07:55.792
Samantha cheated,
and there were no--

07:55.875 --> 07:58.208
thank you-- no consequences.
She's just way too young

07:58.291 --> 08:00.083
to give up on having morals.

08:00.166 --> 08:01.250
So I guess we're done talking

08:01.333 --> 08:03.417
about my grandmother's
diagnosis then.

08:03.500 --> 08:05.583
Heather, it's not too late
to teach Samantha a lesson.

08:05.667 --> 08:07.875
When I was a kid,
I used to swap price tags

08:07.959 --> 08:09.667
to get things cheaper.

08:09.750 --> 08:11.500
Oh, honey, I know.
But don't feel bad about that.

08:11.583 --> 08:13.333
You grew up
in a different world.

08:13.417 --> 08:15.208
I grew up in a gated community.

08:15.291 --> 08:16.542
-Oh.
-I just liked the thrill

08:16.625 --> 08:18.959
of stealing things.
So my mom had my neighbor

08:19.041 --> 08:21.208
dress up like a cop
to scare me straight.

08:21.291 --> 08:23.917
But don't you still
swap price tags?

08:24.000 --> 08:26.041
Yes, but only because,

08:26.125 --> 08:27.583
on his way over to scare me,

08:27.667 --> 08:30.083
a drug dealer thought
my neighbor was a real cop

08:30.166 --> 08:32.709
and just shot him dead. Yeah.

08:32.792 --> 08:35.208
But I really think
the plan would have worked.

08:38.041 --> 08:40.709
Mom, my life is over!

08:40.792 --> 08:41.917
What happened, sweetie?

08:42.041 --> 08:44.250
Ten bucks says she's pregnant.

08:44.333 --> 08:46.458
I got an e-mail from the DMV.

08:46.542 --> 08:49.375
Oh, did you? Hmm.

08:49.458 --> 08:51.417
I wonder what that said.

08:51.500 --> 08:53.250
They found out I took
Dad's traffic test for him

08:53.333 --> 08:55.834
and said I can't get my license
until I'm 21.

08:55.917 --> 08:57.583
Mm. Wow, that's tough.

08:57.667 --> 08:59.417
I hope you learned
a valuable lesson.

08:59.500 --> 09:01.291
-I did.
-Good.

09:01.375 --> 09:03.625
I went right to the DMV
to apologize.

09:03.709 --> 09:04.959
You went to the what now?

09:05.041 --> 09:06.375
I had to explain what happened.

09:06.458 --> 09:07.834
-Oh...
-I told them that Dad bribed me

09:07.917 --> 09:09.458
to take his traffic test
for him.

09:09.542 --> 09:11.291
Oh, Samantha, I wish
you wouldn't have done that.

09:11.375 --> 09:12.917
The e-mail was from me!

09:13.000 --> 09:14.208
You tricked me?

09:14.291 --> 09:18.000
Yes! Because I wanted
to teach you a valuable lesson!

09:18.083 --> 09:20.208
Well, I guess that explains
why the DMV can't spell

09:20.291 --> 09:22.959
-the word "parallel."
-Heather!

09:23.041 --> 09:27.000
Heather, I just got
an e-mail from the DMV.

09:27.083 --> 09:29.875
They found out somehow that
Samantha took the test for me,

09:29.959 --> 09:31.458
and now they're suspending
my license!

09:31.542 --> 09:34.208
Don't worry, Dad, that was
probably a fake e-mail from Mom.

09:34.291 --> 09:36.208
She's pathological.

09:36.291 --> 09:39.000
Heather, please tell me
that e-mail was from you.

09:39.083 --> 09:40.875
(groans)

09:40.959 --> 09:42.000
Oh, Heather!

09:47.083 --> 09:48.583
GREG:
Hey, guys,

09:48.667 --> 09:51.917
check out these vintage Jordans
I got for my big job interview.

09:52.000 --> 09:52.959
I heard the CEO

09:53.041 --> 09:54.041
collects these.

09:54.125 --> 09:55.542
-Oh, yeah.
-Uh-uh-uh-uh.

09:55.625 --> 09:57.291
No touch, okay?
They're still mint.

09:57.375 --> 10:01.000
Yeah, I outbid a 12-year-old
from Bel Air for these things.

10:01.083 --> 10:03.250
Are those the shoes you wanted
to put in our china cabinet?

10:03.333 --> 10:04.750
Yeah. But then I realized

10:04.834 --> 10:06.792
you don't put shoes
in a china cabinet.

10:10.208 --> 10:11.750
You know, this behavior
would be understandable

10:11.834 --> 10:13.834
if there was any reason for it.

10:13.917 --> 10:15.417
Well, he's just trying
to make up for not being cool

10:15.500 --> 10:17.083
in high school.
I think it's kind of cute.

10:17.166 --> 10:18.750
As long as I can ignore the fact

10:18.834 --> 10:20.542
that he spent our vacation money
on them.

10:20.625 --> 10:22.250
-He-he was cool in high school.
-(groans)

10:22.333 --> 10:25.041
Yeah, you slayed, baby.
You slayed.

10:25.125 --> 10:26.375
Eh, not so much, Ma.

10:26.458 --> 10:28.166
I was kind of an embarrassment.

10:28.250 --> 10:30.166
I mean, that's why Matt wouldn't
even drive me to school.

10:30.250 --> 10:32.500
Uh, I drove you to school.

10:32.583 --> 10:34.333
No, you didn't.
You said I didn't meet

10:34.417 --> 10:35.625
the height requirement.

10:35.709 --> 10:37.125
-Ah...
-The point is,

10:37.208 --> 10:38.792
it took me a long time
to get over

10:38.875 --> 10:40.583
the years of your neglect,

10:40.667 --> 10:41.625
but...

10:41.709 --> 10:42.709
I'm over it.

10:42.792 --> 10:44.041
Totes over it.

10:44.125 --> 10:45.542
(knocks on table)

10:47.333 --> 10:48.709
Over it!

10:51.291 --> 10:53.750
Oh, man!

10:58.041 --> 10:59.375
Get in.

11:01.500 --> 11:03.083
Yes, you.

11:03.166 --> 11:04.667
I feel bad about
not driving you to school,

11:04.750 --> 11:06.333
so I'm taking you
to that interview.

11:06.417 --> 11:09.125
You're gonna give me a ride
in Blue Ferrigno?

11:09.208 --> 11:11.333
-(tires screech)
-Man, that sound!

11:11.417 --> 11:13.083
It's just like I used
to hear from my bedroom

11:13.166 --> 11:15.583
-after you would lock me in it.
-(chuckles)

11:18.417 --> 11:19.750
Oh, man.

11:19.834 --> 11:23.834
Th-This is exactly
how I imagined this would be.

11:23.917 --> 11:26.083
I got to be honest with you, one
of the reasons I didn't take you

11:26.166 --> 11:27.583
to school is because
I didn't always go.

11:27.667 --> 11:29.959
-What?
-I'd skip school.

11:30.041 --> 11:31.542
I'd drive around in this bad boy

11:31.625 --> 11:34.500
and pick up on the
junior college transfer girls.

11:34.583 --> 11:36.000
Wow.

11:36.083 --> 11:37.500
Hey, I got to ask.

11:37.583 --> 11:39.625
-I mean, s-since
we're talking about it.
-Hmm?

11:39.709 --> 11:41.875
How many girls
have you been with?

11:41.959 --> 11:43.166
Oh, I'm not telling you.

11:43.250 --> 11:44.583
What? No, come on!

11:44.667 --> 11:46.000
(chuckles):
No, I'm not gonna tell you.

11:46.083 --> 11:47.250
It's lame to talk about.
I don't...

11:47.333 --> 11:48.500
All right, w-well, fine.

11:48.583 --> 11:50.959
Just, uh... just honk

11:51.041 --> 11:53.291
-how many times. Come on,
just do it, just do it.
-(laughs)

11:53.375 --> 11:54.417
-Uh, uh...
-Code.

11:54.500 --> 11:55.458
Bro code.

11:55.542 --> 11:56.500
Uh-huh.

11:56.583 --> 11:58.375
-(honks twice)
-Ah.

11:58.458 --> 12:02.375
-Uh-huh. Oh.
-(continues honking)

12:02.458 --> 12:03.709
I'm gonna need two horns
for this one.

12:03.792 --> 12:04.792
-(honks twice)
-What?

12:04.875 --> 12:06.750
(honking rapidly)

12:06.834 --> 12:08.125
Okay. (stammers) Stop honking.

12:08.208 --> 12:09.750
Okay. I'm sorry.
I was done anyway.

12:09.834 --> 12:12.208
-And then there was
college. (honks)
-That was before college?!

12:12.291 --> 12:14.834
Why? How many have you had?

12:14.917 --> 12:16.166
-Let's just listen to music,
shall we?
-No, no, no!

12:16.250 --> 12:17.208
Don't turn on the radio!

12:17.291 --> 12:18.375
It'll short out the...

12:18.458 --> 12:19.709
(groaning)

12:19.792 --> 12:22.208
-(engine sputtering)
-(Matt groans)

12:23.583 --> 12:25.000
(groans)

12:26.291 --> 12:28.792
No, no, no, no, no.
Oh, man!

12:28.875 --> 12:30.792
Another driver canceled.

12:30.875 --> 12:33.959
Great. And now I'm gonna
be late for my interview.

12:34.041 --> 12:35.750
Well, it's, like,
ten minutes away. Let's walk.

12:35.834 --> 12:37.333
No, I can't walk in these shoes.

12:37.417 --> 12:38.375
What?

12:38.458 --> 12:39.583
They're mint!

12:39.667 --> 12:41.041
Do you know how much wear
and tear

12:41.125 --> 12:42.875
ten minutes would do to these?

12:42.959 --> 12:44.792
They would plummet
from "new in the box"

12:44.875 --> 12:46.166
down to "very, very good."

12:46.250 --> 12:47.250
What do you want to do?

12:47.333 --> 12:50.083
I don't know.

12:50.166 --> 12:52.458
Well...

12:52.542 --> 12:53.667
What are you doing?
Dude, what are you doing?

12:53.750 --> 12:55.208
What are you... Really?

12:55.291 --> 12:57.500
-Will you give me
a piggyback ride? Come on.
-No! (stammers)

12:57.583 --> 12:59.375
-Just give me...
Step away from the curb.
-Get off of me.

13:00.625 --> 13:02.875
Do I really have
to hold your hand?

13:02.959 --> 13:05.959
Yeah, these seat covers
are slippery.

13:07.458 --> 13:08.792
Why don't you just
take the Jordans off?

13:08.875 --> 13:10.792
Well, because they make
me feel good, you know.

13:10.875 --> 13:13.375
Not everybody has the same
number of honks as you do.

13:13.458 --> 13:15.458
Oh, life isn't all
about the honks, Gregory.

13:15.542 --> 13:17.291
And, besides, you probably got
a couple little beeps in there.

13:17.375 --> 13:18.542
-Right? Yeah.
-Eh, well...

13:18.625 --> 13:20.041
Man, you're lucky
you weren't in my car.

13:20.125 --> 13:22.542
You actually went to class, and
you became this guy, you know?

13:22.625 --> 13:24.750
This guy who's gonna
go get this job.

13:24.834 --> 13:26.458
Are you saying I'm cool?

13:26.542 --> 13:29.208
Well, you're wearing
my seat beads on your feet.

13:29.291 --> 13:30.375
Yeah.

13:33.834 --> 13:36.917
Looks like we made it.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.792
Hey, Matt, thanks again.

13:39.875 --> 13:40.834
Yeah.

13:40.917 --> 13:42.083
I'm gonna make you proud.

13:42.166 --> 13:43.208
Aw, Greg,

13:43.291 --> 13:45.125
man, you already have.

13:48.083 --> 13:49.041
Dude!

13:49.125 --> 13:50.250
Oh!

13:50.333 --> 13:51.750
Dude!

13:51.834 --> 13:53.000
You did that on purpose!

13:53.083 --> 13:54.583
What?! No, I didn't! I'm sorry!

13:54.667 --> 13:56.417
It's not my fault
you don't have any balance!

13:56.500 --> 13:57.834
Oh, forget it, man!

13:57.917 --> 13:59.458
I can't go in there now!

13:59.542 --> 14:02.917
No shoe company's gonna hire me
looking like this!

14:03.000 --> 14:05.041
(sighs)

14:05.125 --> 14:07.375
Well, now it makes sense.

14:07.458 --> 14:09.792
(sighs)

14:15.417 --> 14:18.125
Yeah.

14:18.208 --> 14:20.041
JOHN:
Was that great or what?

14:20.125 --> 14:22.750
-An old-fashioned movie night.
-Yeah.

14:22.834 --> 14:25.250
Oh, it really brings me back
to when the kids were little.

14:25.333 --> 14:27.625
Yeah, I remember that. You
would set us up with a movie

14:27.709 --> 14:29.458
and then go upstairs
and fold laundry.

14:29.542 --> 14:31.250
Yeah, that's what was going on.

14:31.333 --> 14:32.375
HEATHER:
You know what?

14:32.458 --> 14:34.542
I think that
we should do this every week.

14:34.625 --> 14:35.709
-SAMANTHA: Yeah.
-COLLEEN: Oh, yay.

14:35.792 --> 14:36.917
SOPHIA:
That'd be fun.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.792
No, but-but-but-but
she meant instead of brunch.

14:39.875 --> 14:41.041
We can do both.

14:41.125 --> 14:43.125
We already do,
because technically,

14:43.208 --> 14:45.542
brunch is both breakfast
and lunch.

14:45.625 --> 14:49.000
Right,
so we'll see you tomorrow.

14:51.375 --> 14:54.375
Now we've got a weekly
brunch <i>and </i>a movie night?

14:54.458 --> 14:55.750
We were just here
eight hours ago.

14:55.834 --> 14:56.917
We didn't even bother
to take Lark

14:57.041 --> 14:58.000
out of her car seat last night.

14:58.083 --> 14:59.500
It's too much.

14:59.583 --> 15:01.625
-Is that the right answer?
-I mean, don't you think, Tim?

15:01.709 --> 15:03.166
I'm gonna wait to see
how you react

15:03.250 --> 15:04.709
to her answer before I answer.

15:04.792 --> 15:07.125
I have literally seen
conjoined twins

15:07.208 --> 15:09.291
spend less time together
than this family.

15:09.375 --> 15:11.625
Yeah, now that I've seen your
reaction, it's sickening.

15:11.709 --> 15:14.583
Yeah, but isn't it,
isn't it kind of sweet

15:14.667 --> 15:17.208
how much they love each other?

15:17.291 --> 15:19.667
-Because I don't think it is.
Mm-mm, mm-mm.
-No. No.

15:19.750 --> 15:21.750
-You know what this is about?
It's about boundaries.
-Mm-hmm.

15:21.834 --> 15:23.709
Because if we don't
fight this now,

15:23.792 --> 15:25.875
we're gonna be over here
every single night,

15:25.959 --> 15:27.166
-and we're not even
blood-related.
-Oh.

15:27.250 --> 15:29.125
I think they're the in-laws,

15:29.208 --> 15:32.375
-we are the out-laws.
-(gasps)

15:32.458 --> 15:34.125
-Yeah. And we don't play...
-Yeah.

15:34.208 --> 15:36.000
-...by their rules;
we make our own rules.
-Yeah. That's right.

15:36.083 --> 15:38.250
-Rule number one: no rules.
-Okay.

15:38.333 --> 15:40.208
-Rule number two: be courteous.
-Sure.

15:40.291 --> 15:41.417
Rule number three: elections.

15:41.500 --> 15:42.625
-Hmm.
-Election rule number one:

15:42.709 --> 15:44.583
no rules.
Election rule number two:

15:44.667 --> 15:46.250
-contesting elections. Now...
-Okay. I don't know.

15:46.333 --> 15:49.375
I just don't want to be
the bad guy and not show up.

15:49.458 --> 15:53.000
But no one will be the bad guy
if we present a united front.

15:53.083 --> 15:54.208
-Uh-huh.
-We are going to take a stand

15:54.291 --> 15:58.083
-together. Who is with me?
-(gasps)

15:58.166 --> 15:59.333
-That's you guys.
You guys are with me.
-Oh.

15:59.417 --> 16:00.834
-Do it again, do it again.
-Uh, who's with me?

16:00.917 --> 16:02.208
-Yeah!
-We are!
-Good.

16:02.291 --> 16:03.709
-One, two, three...
-(whoops)

16:03.792 --> 16:06.625
-Outlaws!
-Girls!
-Outlaws!

16:06.709 --> 16:09.792
JOHN:
<i>All right, everyone,</i>
<i>movie night in four minutes.</i>

16:09.875 --> 16:12.625
-They're making a serious
stand by not coming.
-Yeah, I know it.

16:12.709 --> 16:14.875
But, you know, we have
to support our spouses.

16:14.959 --> 16:16.834
Right. But, just to be clear,

16:16.917 --> 16:19.125
if-if Mom asks, we are
telling her the truth, right?

16:19.208 --> 16:21.208
Oh, absolutely. Where's Jen?

16:21.291 --> 16:22.750
-She, uh, has a headache.
-Yeah, Tim, too.

16:22.834 --> 16:23.917
Yeah,

16:24.000 --> 16:25.834
he was chasing a street sweeper
because he thought

16:25.917 --> 16:27.750
it was an ice cream truck
and then the lights just...

16:27.834 --> 16:29.542
(pops) set off a migraine.

16:29.625 --> 16:31.291
Uh, and Colleen?

16:31.375 --> 16:32.959
I guess she's sick as well?

16:33.041 --> 16:34.875
Actually, Mom,
she decided to stay home...

16:36.250 --> 16:39.291
...to celebrate the Mexican
holiday of Adidas.

16:42.333 --> 16:43.750
"Surround yourself
with loved ones,

16:43.834 --> 16:45.667
for someday they might be gone."

16:47.375 --> 16:49.542
-No.
-MAN (on TV): <i>Next, on</i>
A Little Off The Nose.

16:49.625 --> 16:51.166
-That's the same girl?
-(phone rings)

16:51.250 --> 16:52.583
WOMAN:
<i>I don't even recognize myself.</i>

16:52.667 --> 16:53.709
Oh. Hi.

16:53.792 --> 16:55.041
COLLEEN:
<i>Jen, I'm worried that</i>

16:55.125 --> 16:56.083
if we don't go to movie night,

16:56.166 --> 16:57.166
John and Joan will die.

16:57.250 --> 17:01.166
John and Joan, or John <i>or </i>Joan?

17:01.250 --> 17:03.792
I just got into this family.
Okay? They like me still.

17:03.875 --> 17:05.458
Plus, it's really good
to have a white family

17:05.542 --> 17:06.750
as a character witness.

17:06.834 --> 17:08.208
Hey. How about this?

17:08.291 --> 17:10.166
We could spend our
Saturday night together.

17:10.250 --> 17:12.500
You could come over, hang out,

17:12.583 --> 17:14.875
sit on the floor with Lark,
play with her.

17:14.959 --> 17:16.834
I could come in
and check on you.

17:16.917 --> 17:18.125
So, like, babysit?

17:18.208 --> 17:20.458
Well, no, you-you pay
a babysitter.

17:20.542 --> 17:22.375
But just-just stay united.

17:22.458 --> 17:23.875
Okay, fine.

17:23.959 --> 17:26.625
I don't trust this bitch.

17:28.792 --> 17:30.250
Mm?

17:30.333 --> 17:32.166
Hi.

17:32.250 --> 17:34.125
-Where are you going?
-Nowhere.

17:34.208 --> 17:36.500
-Nowhere, huh?
-Nope.

17:36.583 --> 17:39.667
-I was just going
to the horse show.
-Mmm.

17:39.750 --> 17:41.333
She was going to movie night!

17:41.417 --> 17:43.834
And you came over to stop her?

17:43.917 --> 17:45.750
Well, kind of.
She called, said something

17:45.834 --> 17:48.000
about Chinese food, so I just
hung up and rushed over here.

17:48.083 --> 17:50.792
Dumpling House
won't deliver to me anymore.

17:50.875 --> 17:52.792
The story is long.

17:52.875 --> 17:54.000
You want to hear it?

17:54.083 --> 17:55.417
No.

17:55.500 --> 17:58.375
<i>(groaning)</i>

17:58.458 --> 18:00.083
Oh, this is so stupid, you guys.

18:00.166 --> 18:01.667
We're doing the same thing here

18:01.750 --> 18:03.333
that we would be doing
over there.

18:03.417 --> 18:05.667
Okay, you're right.
Let's go over.

18:05.750 --> 18:07.709
No. We are not going over.

18:07.792 --> 18:09.500
It's the principle, okay?

18:09.583 --> 18:10.750
It is weird
that I spend more time

18:10.834 --> 18:12.417
with them than I do
my own family.

18:12.500 --> 18:14.417
Why don't you spend more time
with your family?

18:14.500 --> 18:16.291
Because the Shorts
are better than my family.

18:16.375 --> 18:17.417
They enjoy

18:17.500 --> 18:19.041
each other's company,

18:19.125 --> 18:20.792
they forgive each other
without holding grudges.

18:20.875 --> 18:23.083
When they ask how your day was,
it's not a trap.

18:23.166 --> 18:25.333
It's all very dysfunctional.

18:25.417 --> 18:27.959
I am understanding
so much more about you now.

18:28.041 --> 18:29.375
No, you're not.

18:29.458 --> 18:30.625
Okay, I'm not.

18:30.709 --> 18:31.792
We need to take a vote.

18:31.875 --> 18:33.542
Allow me to recap
the voting rules.

18:33.625 --> 18:34.875
Rule number one:
no rules.

18:34.959 --> 18:37.041
-Rule number two...
-Wait. Look-look-look.

18:37.125 --> 18:39.000
-We're just gonna stay here.
I'm gonna run to the bathroom.
-Okay.

18:39.083 --> 18:40.583
We're gonna drink some wine,
we're gonna hunker down

18:40.667 --> 18:42.250
for the night.
It's gonna be so fun.

18:42.333 --> 18:43.625
Okay.

18:45.125 --> 18:47.750
Sorry, I ate all the noodles.

18:49.000 --> 18:52.625
(sighs)

18:52.709 --> 18:55.125
She's been in there kind of
a long time, huh?

18:55.208 --> 18:57.166
Maybe she took all her clothes
off to go to the bathroom.

18:57.250 --> 18:59.667
It's just taking a long time
to put them back on.

19:00.667 --> 19:02.000
Some people do that.

19:04.417 --> 19:06.125
Colleen?

19:06.208 --> 19:08.875
You wearing clothes?

19:08.959 --> 19:12.417
Oh, come on. Ugh.

19:12.500 --> 19:13.834
She went out the window.

19:13.917 --> 19:16.667
Do you believe that, Tim?

19:16.750 --> 19:18.792
Tim?

19:23.333 --> 19:25.375
NICOLAS CAGE:
<i>It's like when I was robbin'</i>
<i>convenience stores.</i>

19:25.458 --> 19:27.125
(sobbing):
<i>I love him so much.</i>

19:27.208 --> 19:28.875
-(door opens)
-COLLEEN: Hi!

19:28.959 --> 19:30.709
Sorry, I locked myself
in my own car

19:30.792 --> 19:31.917
in the driveway-- oops.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.291
Well, good, you made it.

19:33.375 --> 19:34.709
Yes, I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

19:34.792 --> 19:37.291
Feliz Adidas, Colleen.

19:37.375 --> 19:40.291
-Say gracias.
-Gracias.

19:40.375 --> 19:41.667
-Yup.
-TIM: Oh!

19:41.750 --> 19:43.166
You guys'll never guess
what happened.

19:43.250 --> 19:45.625
I was cooking myself
this really healthy meal

19:45.709 --> 19:47.709
of fruits and vegetables
and whole grains and...

19:47.792 --> 19:49.500
Nobody cares. Sit down.

19:49.583 --> 19:51.458
-Okay.
-HEATHER: Hey, babe.

19:51.542 --> 19:52.709
-Aw.
-Hi, babe.

19:52.792 --> 19:54.250
-I'm so glad that you're here.
-Oh.

19:54.333 --> 19:56.834
-Oh, you smell
like Chinese food.
-Shh.

19:56.917 --> 19:59.333
I guess, uh, Jen still
has a headache.

19:59.417 --> 20:01.667
That's too bad.

20:01.750 --> 20:04.834
Movie's starting.
Everybody shut up.

20:04.917 --> 20:06.041
CAGE:
<i>Lookee here, young sportsman.</i>

20:06.125 --> 20:07.750
<i>That there's the kitchen area,</i>

20:07.834 --> 20:09.625
<i>where Ma and Pa chow down.</i>

20:09.709 --> 20:12.166
<i>This here's the TV.</i>
<i>Two hours a day, maximum,</i>

20:12.250 --> 20:13.208
<i>either-either educational</i>

20:13.291 --> 20:15.041
<i>or football so as, you know,</i>

20:15.125 --> 20:16.417
<i>you don't ruin</i>
<i>your appreciation</i>

20:16.500 --> 20:17.917
-(door closes)
<i>-of the finer things.</i>

20:18.000 --> 20:19.917
<i>(baby cries)</i>

20:20.000 --> 20:21.583
CAGE:
<i>What, are you kidding?</i>

20:21.667 --> 20:24.583
<i>-We got us a family here.</i>
-Hi.

20:24.667 --> 20:25.709
Hi, Mommy!

20:25.792 --> 20:27.000
I said shut up.

20:27.083 --> 20:28.041
Okay.

20:28.125 --> 20:30.250
I'm glad your headache
is gone.

20:30.333 --> 20:32.667
I realized headaches
aren't so bad,

20:32.750 --> 20:35.583
even if they're twice a week.

20:35.667 --> 20:36.709
<i>He's a little outlaw.</i>

20:36.792 --> 20:38.625
Outlaws!

20:38.709 --> 20:40.667
I said no talking.
Now I got to rewind

20:40.750 --> 20:41.959
the VHS, and it's gonna

20:42.041 --> 20:43.583
take about 20 minutes.

20:43.667 --> 20:44.709
(all groaning)

20:44.792 --> 20:46.291
-Well, should we play a game?
-HEATHER: Ooh!

20:46.375 --> 20:49.250
Or should we have a separate
game night for that?

20:49.333 --> 20:51.792
-Yes!
-(kids cheering)

20:51.875 --> 20:53.542
We could host it at our place.

20:53.625 --> 20:55.291
-HEATHER: Oh, great!
-Yay!

21:16.500 --> 21:18.083
