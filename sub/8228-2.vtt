37:05.357 --> 37:06.690
[ LAUGHS ]

37:06.692 --> 37:10.427
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OUR FIRST
TEST AND OUR FINAL TEST,

37:10.429 --> 37:13.029
HOPEFULLY, IS THE FINAL TEST
WILL BE A CONTAINED EXPLOSION.

37:13.031 --> 37:14.497
NOW, WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT
WHEN WE SAY

37:14.499 --> 37:15.765
"CONTAINED EXPLOSION"?

37:15.767 --> 37:17.701
WELL, IF YOU TAKE SOME
BLACK POWDER AND YOU POUR IT

37:17.703 --> 37:19.035
IN AN OPEN SURFACE

37:19.037 --> 37:22.372
AND YOU LIGHT IT, IT GOES...
[ IMITATES WHOOSH ]

37:22.374 --> 37:23.974
BUT YOU TAKE THE SAME AMOUNT
OF BLACK POWDER

37:23.976 --> 37:27.043
AND YOU WRAP IT
IN SOME TAPE NICE AND TIGHT,

37:27.045 --> 37:29.379
THAT WHOOSH TURNS INTO A BANG!

37:29.381 --> 37:30.580
[ EXPLOSION ]

37:30.582 --> 37:34.450
AND SO, HOPEFULLY,
WHEN WE HAVE THAT CRIMINAL

37:34.452 --> 37:35.585
STUCK IN THE TOP OF OUR CHIMNEY,

37:35.587 --> 37:39.389
HE'LL FLY OUT OF THERE
LIKE HIS BUTT'S ON FIRE.

37:39.391 --> 37:40.523
¶¶

37:40.525 --> 37:41.658
Narrator: THERE'S JUST TIME

37:41.660 --> 37:43.393
FOR A FEW HOMEY TOUCHES

37:43.395 --> 37:45.795
BEFORE THIS MYTH
GETS PUT TO THE TORCH.

37:45.797 --> 37:46.996
BOOM!

37:46.998 --> 37:48.531
AW! BEAUTIFUL!

37:48.533 --> 37:51.801
HOW DOES IT LOOK?

37:51.803 --> 37:53.602
[ LAUGHS ] IT LOOKS LIKE
A HAPPY FAMILY TO ME.

37:53.604 --> 37:57.140
-I THINK SO, MAN. I THINK SO.
-[ LAUGHS ]

37:57.142 --> 38:00.810
Narrator: ADD ONE NOT-SO-HAPPY
BURGLAR BUSTER...

38:00.812 --> 38:02.144
THIS IS THE MAN OF THIS MYTH.

38:02.146 --> 38:05.081
IT'S TIME FOR OUR BURGLAR
TO GET STUCK IN OUR CHIMNEY.

38:05.083 --> 38:08.151
Narrator: ...WHO'S ALREADY
HAVING SECOND THOUGHTS

38:08.153 --> 38:09.285
ABOUT HIS FIRST DAY
BACK ON THE JOB.

38:09.287 --> 38:10.287
GOT TO REMEMBER, JON.

38:10.289 --> 38:13.089
THIS GUY TRIED REALLY
HARD TO GET IN.

38:13.091 --> 38:15.892
WE GOT VALUABLE PAINTINGS
OF DOGS.

38:15.894 --> 38:18.028
-HIS ASS IS IN.
-OKAY.

38:18.030 --> 38:20.230
Narrator:
BUT THERE'S ONE SMALL SNAG.

38:20.232 --> 38:21.831
OH, I SEE HIM STRUGGLING.

38:21.833 --> 38:23.499
ACTUALLY,
THAT'S ME STRUGGLING.

38:23.501 --> 38:24.567
Narrator: DESPITE APPEARANCES,

38:24.569 --> 38:26.703
BUSTER'S NOT QUITE
A SNUG ENOUGH FIT.

38:26.705 --> 38:30.774
SO WE WANT OUR BURGLAR TO HAVE
A GOOD FIT IN THE CHIMNEY

38:30.776 --> 38:31.775
TO GET THE BEST CHANCE
OF AN EXPLOSION.

38:31.777 --> 38:32.976
HE'S A LITTLE FIT RIGHT NOW,

38:32.978 --> 38:36.112
SO WE NEED TO MAKE HIM
A LITTLE MORE ROTUND.

38:36.114 --> 38:38.848
TO DO THAT, WE PUT A LITTLE
EXPANDING FOAM

38:38.850 --> 38:40.850
AROUND HIS BELLY
IN A PLASTIC BAG.

38:40.852 --> 38:44.587
Narrator: WITH OUR BEEFED UP
BURGLAR NOW FIRMLY WEDGED IN,

38:44.589 --> 38:49.192
THEY'RE SET TO BUST OR CONFIRM
THIS MYTH ONCE AND FOR ALL.

38:49.194 --> 38:52.194
AT THIS POINT, OUR BURGLAR'S
STUCK IN THE TOP OF OUR CHIMNEY.

38:52.196 --> 38:53.662
THAT MAKES AN ENCLOSED VESSEL.

38:53.664 --> 38:57.666
AND I THINK WE'RE GOING TO POP
HIM OUT LIKE A CHAMPAGNE CORK.

38:57.668 --> 38:58.868
¶¶

38:58.870 --> 39:03.540
FIREPLACE LEAK WITH BURGLAR
STUCK IN THE CHIMNEY

39:03.542 --> 39:06.943
IN THREE, TWO, ONE!

39:06.945 --> 39:11.147
[ BOOM ]
[ LAUGHS ]

39:11.149 --> 39:14.884
[ LAUGHS ]

39:14.886 --> 39:15.819
[ BOOM ]

39:15.821 --> 39:18.421
WELL, THERE YOU GO.

39:18.423 --> 39:19.422
[ LAUGHS ]

39:19.424 --> 39:20.357
OH!

39:20.359 --> 39:21.557
[ BOOM ]

39:21.559 --> 39:25.228
LOOK, THERE'S SMOKE
COMING OUT OF HIS PANTS.

39:25.230 --> 39:27.563
[ LAUGHS ]
STRAIGHT OUT OF THE CARTOONS.

39:27.565 --> 39:29.832
-OH! JON!
-YEAH?

39:29.834 --> 39:31.301
OUR LIVING ROOM!

39:31.303 --> 39:33.035
BO'S PICTURE!

39:33.037 --> 39:34.704
OH, REALLY?

39:34.706 --> 39:36.305
¶¶

39:36.307 --> 39:37.706
[ LAUGHS ]

39:37.708 --> 39:40.176
[ HISSES ]

39:40.178 --> 39:41.644
OUR CRIMINAL KIND OF
JUST POPPED UP

39:41.646 --> 39:43.846
AND LANDED RIGHT BACK
IN THE CHIMNEY.

39:43.848 --> 39:45.782
BUT THE STOICHIOMETRY WAS RIGHT.

39:45.784 --> 39:47.917
THE DOORS BOWED OPEN.
[ BOOM ]

39:47.919 --> 39:49.852
BO BLEW OFF THE WALL.

39:49.854 --> 39:51.254
OUR ROBBER SHOT UP
ABOUT A FOOT AND A HALF

39:51.256 --> 39:53.790
BUT THEN LANDED
RIGHT BACK IN OUR CHIMNEY,

39:53.792 --> 39:55.124
SO IT WASN'T A GREAT ESCAPE.

39:55.126 --> 39:58.060
Narrator: WITH ALL THE ELEMENTS
PERFECTLY IN PLACE,

39:58.062 --> 40:02.064
BUSTER STILL COULDN'T
RISE TO THE OCCASION.

40:02.066 --> 40:04.467
BUT THEY'RE NOT GOING HOME
WITHOUT SOMETHING

40:04.469 --> 40:06.069
TO SHOW FOR THEIR EFFORTS.

40:06.071 --> 40:07.337
IN FINEST
"MythBusters" TRADITION,

40:07.339 --> 40:10.607
THAT MEANS RAMPING IT WAY UP
TO GET A RESULT.

40:10.609 --> 40:14.343
WE'RE ABOUT TO ADD MORE
OXYGEN INTO OUR CHIMNEY,

40:14.345 --> 40:16.079
AND THAT MEANS A BIGGER BOOM.

40:16.081 --> 40:20.417
Narrator: INSTEAD OF USING AIR,
WHICH IS MOSTLY NITROGEN,

40:20.419 --> 40:22.752
THEY'RE PUMPING IN PURE OXYGEN.

40:22.754 --> 40:27.156
BUT WILL THAT BE ENOUGH
TO FINALLY BLAST BUSTER

40:27.158 --> 40:28.158
INTO THE BACKYARD?

40:28.160 --> 40:29.625
-YOU READY?
-I'M READY.

40:29.627 --> 40:30.760
OKAY.

40:30.762 --> 40:36.299
WHAT WOULD IT TAKE?
IN THREE, TWO, ONE.

40:36.301 --> 40:37.367
[ EXPLOSION ]

40:37.369 --> 40:39.969
OH! [ LAUGHS ]

40:39.971 --> 40:40.703
I FELT THAT ONE
IN THE CHEST.

40:40.705 --> 40:41.838
[ EXPLOSION ]

40:41.840 --> 40:44.173
Narrator:
THAT PROBABLY GOES FOR EVERYONE

40:44.175 --> 40:45.975
IN A 1-MILE RADIUS.

40:45.977 --> 40:50.046
[ EXPLOSIONS ]

40:50.048 --> 40:51.581

40:51.583 --> 40:54.250
YOU THINK WE'LL STILL GET
THE DEPOSIT BACK ON THE HOUSE?

40:54.252 --> 40:56.185
-NO.
-OOH.

40:56.187 --> 40:57.854
[ EXPLOSION ]

40:57.856 --> 41:00.390
Jon: AS YOU CAN SEE,
ALL THAT EXTRA OXYGEN

41:00.392 --> 41:04.928
DEFINITELY GAVE US
MORE BANG FOR OUR BUCK.

41:04.930 --> 41:08.397
HOLY MOLY. LOOK AT THIS.
[ GRUNTS ]

41:08.399 --> 41:11.667
OH.

41:11.669 --> 41:16.139
THIS IS
A REINFORCED STEEL FIREBOX,

41:16.141 --> 41:21.277
AND IT TOTALLY JUST BOWED OUT
OUR LITTLE SUPPORT STRUTS.

41:21.279 --> 41:23.479
[ EXPLOSION ]

41:23.481 --> 41:25.147
LOOK AT THE BURGLAR.

41:25.149 --> 41:28.083
[ LAUGHS ]
IT BLEW HIS PANTS OFF.

41:28.085 --> 41:28.952
[ LAUGHS ]

41:28.954 --> 41:29.953
OH, WOW.

41:29.955 --> 41:33.022
I DON'T KNOW, THOUGH.
I THINK HE MOSTLY FELL.

41:33.024 --> 41:35.157
-I DON'T THINK HE SHOT.
-YEAH.

41:35.159 --> 41:36.493
HE'S NOT FAR FROM
WHERE HE BEGAN.

41:36.495 --> 41:40.630
THAT MEANS THAT HIS BODY
AND THE FIREPLACE

41:40.632 --> 41:41.965
WERE A GOOD ENOUGH SEAL

41:41.967 --> 41:46.168
THAT WHEN IT WENT OFF,
IT JUST, BOOM, BLEW IT APART.

41:46.170 --> 41:49.172
[ EXPLOSION ]

41:49.174 --> 41:50.440
Narrator:
AND THERE YOU HAVE IT.

41:50.442 --> 41:54.711
THE MYTHICAL PROPANE MIX
BARELY BUDGED BUSTER,

41:54.713 --> 41:58.715
AND THE RAMPED-UP OXYGEN-RICH
MIX BROUGHT THE HOUSE DOWN.

41:58.717 --> 42:01.717
BUT THERE WAS A DEFINITE FAILURE
TO LAUNCH.

42:01.719 --> 42:02.986
-DEFINITELY BUSTED.
-YEAH.

42:02.988 --> 42:05.054
HE DEFINITELY POPPED UP
A LITTLE BIT ON THAT CHIMNEY,

42:05.056 --> 42:07.924
BUT HE DIDN'T SHOOT OUT.
YEAH, BUT HE DEFINITELY SHOT OUT

42:07.926 --> 42:10.526
WHEN WE TURNED IT
OVER THE TOP.

42:10.528 --> 42:12.061
[ LAUGHS ] YEAH, HE DID.
ALL RIGHT.

42:12.063 --> 42:14.797
-LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.
-YEAH.
