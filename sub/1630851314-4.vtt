00:02.263 --> 00:03.960
<i>Previously on
Roswell, New Mexico...</i>

00:04.004 --> 00:05.614
Howdy, partner.

00:05.657 --> 00:08.312
What did he do to you?
-He told me I'm a clone.

00:08.356 --> 00:10.227
I think someone's getting
murdered.

00:11.533 --> 00:13.317
Have you been
mainlining acetone?

00:13.361 --> 00:15.058
A couple days ago,
it stopped working.

00:15.102 --> 00:18.018
-My heart is racing.
-All signs of
late-stage heart failure.

00:18.061 --> 00:19.236
It was your dad's.

00:19.280 --> 00:22.152
Magoo? Are you there?
-Dad?

00:22.196 --> 00:24.502
Hey, why are you
pushing me away?

00:24.546 --> 00:25.851
<i>I can't do this anymore.</i>

00:25.895 --> 00:27.288
Goodbye, Liz.

00:27.331 --> 00:28.898
We're connected, you and I.

00:28.941 --> 00:30.378
Make it stop. Set me free.

00:30.421 --> 00:32.510
You are broken, Max.

00:54.880 --> 00:57.709
I drove all night. I-I had to.

00:58.928 --> 01:00.190
I'm so sorry.

01:00.234 --> 01:02.714
-I made a mistake.
-I don't understand.

01:02.758 --> 01:05.543
I should never have
pushed you away.

01:05.587 --> 01:06.849
I was...

01:06.892 --> 01:08.111
I was scared.

01:08.155 --> 01:09.852
Of what?

01:09.895 --> 01:13.551
I can't be me without you.

03:16.108 --> 03:17.501
Get me high?

03:17.545 --> 03:19.503
Hope I hallucinate some answers?

03:19.547 --> 03:22.898
I fell down a rabbit hole
of drug studies this morning.

03:22.941 --> 03:25.292
Veterans are using it
to treat their PTSD.

03:25.335 --> 03:27.032
It's helping them access
their subconscious.

03:27.076 --> 03:30.384
So I figure it should help us
find your memory of the funeral.

03:30.427 --> 03:31.602
You just say "us"?

03:31.646 --> 03:34.475
Every quest needs a guide.

03:34.518 --> 03:36.520
I mean, how do you expect
to find Wonderland

03:36.564 --> 03:37.956
without a white rabbit?

03:38.000 --> 03:39.219
Okay, first of all,

03:39.262 --> 03:40.959
my body-- not your Wonderland.

03:41.003 --> 03:42.265
Maria.

03:42.309 --> 03:44.659
The Lincoln Fire is
40% contained.

03:44.702 --> 03:48.532
That means, by next week,
no more ash.

03:48.576 --> 03:50.273
This funeral is happening soon,

03:50.317 --> 03:52.232
so could you just drop
the lone wolf act

03:52.275 --> 03:53.798
and let me help you?

03:55.452 --> 03:58.499
Okay, but one snarky comment
out of you,

03:58.542 --> 04:00.762
and I'm conjuring up
some big bodyguards

04:00.805 --> 04:01.893
to haul you away.

04:03.634 --> 04:05.767
They better be hot, though.

04:24.960 --> 04:26.657
Aw, look.

04:26.701 --> 04:29.399
Our family trees
are kissing.

04:29.443 --> 04:31.358
All this nonsense
going on here,

04:31.401 --> 04:33.969
and that's the one thing
that you notice?

04:34.012 --> 04:35.797
If you like piña coladas,

04:35.840 --> 04:37.581
they're on the house.

04:37.625 --> 04:40.454
I mean, obviously.
-It is your mind.
-Mm-mm.

04:40.497 --> 04:42.456
No, no, no. These are
not my thoughts.

04:42.499 --> 04:43.979
Mm, yes and no.

04:45.154 --> 04:46.416
Half this mess is yours, Iz.

04:46.460 --> 04:47.983
Great.

04:48.026 --> 04:51.203
Could you send us to
the psychic vision section?

04:51.247 --> 04:52.466
-Oh.
-We're looking for...

04:52.509 --> 04:53.771
The funeral.

04:53.815 --> 04:55.033
Mm-hmm. I know.

04:55.077 --> 04:57.819
Only you can find it, Maria.

04:58.950 --> 05:00.517
You can't see
the rest of that funeral

05:00.561 --> 05:01.649
because you don't want to.

05:01.692 --> 05:04.739
I threw myself off a building.

05:04.782 --> 05:08.090
But think of it
like a repressed memory.

05:08.133 --> 05:09.831
It unsettles you.

05:09.874 --> 05:11.789
So, your unconscious
buried it

05:11.833 --> 05:13.443
underneath all this.

05:13.487 --> 05:17.012
Everyone in here represents
a hidden truth.

05:17.055 --> 05:18.927
Confront them, you'll get
where you want to go.

05:18.970 --> 05:21.495
Ignore them,
you got to stay with me.

05:21.538 --> 05:23.453
You have got to be scrooging me.

05:23.497 --> 05:25.977
It's simple really.
Bare your soul.

05:27.631 --> 05:29.894
That one's got to be yours.

05:29.938 --> 05:32.375
What is she doing here, Isobel?

05:32.419 --> 05:35.639
It might have
something to do with this...

05:35.683 --> 05:37.554
dream I have of opening up

05:37.598 --> 05:39.121
a self-defense school
for little girls.

05:39.164 --> 05:40.383
Like Miyagi-Do.

05:43.212 --> 05:44.648
Poof!

05:44.692 --> 05:46.607
Just like the Cheshire Cat.

05:46.650 --> 05:48.696
Oh, God! That reminds me.
Hold on.

05:51.002 --> 05:52.482
You're late.

05:52.526 --> 05:55.920
You had to mention
Wonderland, huh?

05:56.921 --> 05:59.663
Safety is a shared endeavor

05:59.707 --> 06:01.622
that guarantees fairness

06:01.665 --> 06:03.363
and respect for all.

06:03.406 --> 06:04.973
Back in Lovington,

06:05.016 --> 06:07.845
I took a broken contract,
and I rebuilt it.

06:07.889 --> 06:09.456
It took trust,

06:09.499 --> 06:12.197
and it took order,
but we did it.

06:12.241 --> 06:14.852
How do you intend to respond
to the recent string

06:14.896 --> 06:17.159
of robberies
targeting people of color?

06:18.073 --> 06:21.163
I intend to get
to the bottom of it.

06:21.206 --> 06:23.513
Black lives matter,

06:23.557 --> 06:27.125
as do brown, red, white, blue.

06:27.169 --> 06:30.215
And because we're in Roswell--
green.

06:30.259 --> 06:32.304
Now let me point you
in the direction

06:34.263 --> 06:36.439
Hatch green chile cheeseburgers.

06:42.010 --> 06:43.707
Look, I'll tell you
one thing,

06:43.751 --> 06:45.666
this town's missing
a Valenti.

07:01.246 --> 07:02.465
Rosalinda?

07:02.509 --> 07:04.336
-Boo.
-Whoa.

07:06.077 --> 07:08.123
Am I losing my edge?

07:08.166 --> 07:10.604
Just your earring.

07:11.953 --> 07:13.955
You recognized my earring.

07:16.305 --> 07:17.698
Who's that?

07:17.741 --> 07:19.917
Our Lady of Guadalupe.

07:19.961 --> 07:21.702
She's the patron saint
of Mexico.

07:21.745 --> 07:23.486
She's basically bigger
than Jesus.

07:23.530 --> 07:25.967
So, she's got, like,
better powers?

07:27.447 --> 07:29.579
She has Mexican powers.

07:29.623 --> 07:32.669
"There's a crack in everything.

07:32.713 --> 07:35.324
That's how
the light gets in."

07:35.367 --> 07:37.326
That's Leonard Cohen, right?

07:37.369 --> 07:39.415
You barely remember
who you are,

07:39.459 --> 07:41.112
but you remember
"Anthem" lyrics?

07:42.157 --> 07:45.943
I found the box set with some of
my old stuff from high school.

07:45.987 --> 07:48.293
Thought it might help me
remember...

07:48.337 --> 07:50.470
something.

07:50.513 --> 07:52.515
Did it?

07:52.559 --> 07:53.908
Nope.

07:53.951 --> 07:55.518
Which sucks,

07:55.562 --> 07:59.087
because I'm sort of getting
the sense that something...

07:59.130 --> 08:01.655
something pretty bad happened
to my sister.

08:02.612 --> 08:04.832
Something my mom doesn't want me
to find out.

08:06.224 --> 08:07.835
You didn't just google it?

08:07.878 --> 08:10.968
Well, I also get the sense
that it's the sort of thing

08:11.012 --> 08:13.580
you don't really want to find
with an ad banner next to it.

08:13.623 --> 08:15.625
So...

08:15.669 --> 08:18.498
I thought I'd ask you.

08:19.368 --> 08:21.065
Me?

08:21.109 --> 08:22.545
Why not...

08:22.589 --> 08:24.329
why not Jordan?

08:24.373 --> 08:26.854
'Cause he's mean, and you're...

08:28.029 --> 08:29.247
...not.

08:33.382 --> 08:35.602
I don't know anything.

08:44.741 --> 08:46.526
This is why they were mining it.

08:49.050 --> 08:50.530
Did you just make
an intergalactic IPA?

08:50.573 --> 08:52.096
What do you want, Valenti?

08:52.140 --> 08:53.489
Your help.

08:53.533 --> 08:54.969
Last night,

08:55.012 --> 08:57.537
this radio dialed itself
to a frequency

08:57.580 --> 08:59.669
way beyond
the normal broadcast band

08:59.713 --> 09:03.064
and played something weird.

09:03.107 --> 09:04.326
No.

09:04.369 --> 09:05.936
Whoa, whoa. Hey!

09:06.763 --> 09:08.199
I'm all stocked up on stubborn,

09:08.243 --> 09:09.461
and I know that you would be
interested in...

09:11.681 --> 09:12.900
Whoa.

09:13.814 --> 09:15.293
Did that just...

09:16.077 --> 09:18.688
Magoo? Are you there?

09:18.732 --> 09:20.342
If you've...

09:20.385 --> 09:21.691
...you've come too far...

09:21.735 --> 09:23.171
Is that your dad?

09:23.214 --> 09:24.868
Speaking through
a hundred-year-old glowing radio

09:24.912 --> 09:26.478
that's reacting
to your magic rock.

09:28.219 --> 09:29.569
Now you interested?

09:35.183 --> 09:37.185
Max told me about the clone.

09:37.228 --> 09:40.231
But he left out the part
about magic pebbles.

09:41.058 --> 09:42.886
Used to be regular
old turquoise,

09:42.930 --> 09:45.541
but the crash of '47 changed
its composition somehow.

09:45.585 --> 09:46.890
My mom was mining it.

09:46.934 --> 09:48.849
And from what I can tell,
it amplifies

09:48.892 --> 09:50.241
the chemical properties
in anything

09:50.285 --> 09:52.156
that conducts a current.

09:53.593 --> 09:55.246
Alien glass.

09:56.508 --> 09:57.945
That explains the glow.

09:57.988 --> 09:59.120
It's wedged in there
pretty good.

09:59.163 --> 10:00.469
Getting it in is easy.

10:00.512 --> 10:01.731
Fixing this crack,

10:01.775 --> 10:02.906
that's gonna take
some skill.

10:02.950 --> 10:04.691
And you think my dad

10:04.734 --> 10:06.823
somehow put his message
in alien glass?

10:06.867 --> 10:08.433
Better question is,

10:08.477 --> 10:10.610
why did your old man hide it
in a broken radio?

10:10.653 --> 10:12.742
I don't know,

10:12.786 --> 10:14.657
but my great-grandfather
built it.

10:14.701 --> 10:16.224
Used to be the family business.

10:16.267 --> 10:17.573
Hmm.

10:17.617 --> 10:18.922
-Wow.
Mm-hmm.

10:18.966 --> 10:21.446
"In times of trouble,
let this be your guide."

10:22.839 --> 10:24.145
They were poets, too.

10:24.188 --> 10:25.407
Can you fix it?

10:25.450 --> 10:27.757
Uh, boosting the properties
of the glass

10:27.801 --> 10:29.367
could create an ionic bond.

10:29.411 --> 10:30.978
Yeah, like alien Lego.

10:31.761 --> 10:33.633
Grab the pliers.

10:34.808 --> 10:36.679
We're doing surgery.

10:43.033 --> 10:44.687
Oh, I-I know what
you're gonna say,

10:44.731 --> 10:46.080
but I already
did the rounds.

10:46.123 --> 10:48.996
Mm. Uh, well, then let me
humbly suggest

10:49.039 --> 10:50.345
that we do them again.

10:50.388 --> 10:52.913
This event is
honoring you, Liz.

10:52.956 --> 10:56.046
And by the way, our guests
in there, they do fund

10:56.090 --> 10:58.527
your very unorthodox
scientific ideas,

10:58.570 --> 11:00.660
and thus, my car.

11:00.703 --> 11:02.792
Well, maybe they shouldn't.

11:02.836 --> 11:07.841
Oh, so then, this is
about Roswell.

11:09.451 --> 11:11.975
You found the old
spores in your lab,

11:12.019 --> 11:13.890
but there was no DNA.

11:13.934 --> 11:15.849
The spores are still
in my bag.

11:17.024 --> 11:18.939
What, you haven't even
tried them yet?

11:20.462 --> 11:22.159
What's going on, Liz?

11:22.203 --> 11:24.988
I've spent so much time
trying to convince these people

11:25.032 --> 11:27.861
that I belong here,
and I...

11:27.904 --> 11:29.776
I haven't asked myself
if this is where

11:29.819 --> 11:31.168
I'm supposed to be.

11:31.212 --> 11:32.735
You mean on a balcony
with a stunning view

11:32.779 --> 11:33.910
-and funding for days?
-Heath...

11:33.954 --> 11:35.433
I want to help people.

11:35.477 --> 11:37.871
So we should look
-at your spores.
-No.

11:37.914 --> 11:39.350
'Cause once we do,
Genoryx is gonna own

11:39.394 --> 11:40.525
whatever becomes of them.

11:40.569 --> 11:41.744
And without Genoryx,

11:41.788 --> 11:42.963
you won't have a
breakthrough at all.

11:43.006 --> 11:44.181
You don't have
the resources.

11:44.225 --> 11:46.140
Exactly why I'm conflicted.

11:49.230 --> 11:52.537
Okay, I've never told you this.

11:52.581 --> 11:54.931
Uh...

11:54.975 --> 11:56.803
I failed out of Johns Hopkins.

12:00.284 --> 12:03.853
I was sure as hell that
one day I would save the world.

12:03.897 --> 12:06.856
My professor disagreed.

12:06.900 --> 12:10.381
For a long time,
I questioned all of it.

12:10.425 --> 12:14.559
The whole reason that I got
into this in the first place.

12:14.603 --> 12:17.127
Mm. So what'd you do?

12:17.171 --> 12:20.130
Well, I wallowed,
I ate a case of Twinkies,

12:20.174 --> 12:22.306
and then I numbed my brain
on video games.

12:22.350 --> 12:24.569
And then, luckily,
I had a friend

12:24.613 --> 12:26.441
who pulled me out of my head
long enough

12:26.484 --> 12:27.834
to see my way through.

12:27.877 --> 12:29.705
So I should download <i>
Call of Duty?</i>

12:32.882 --> 12:34.536
Well, maybe skip the download.

13:17.753 --> 13:20.887
I didn't mean to hit you, buddy.

13:20.930 --> 13:23.150
My emotions just
got the best of me.

13:25.152 --> 13:27.850
They think I'm a monster.

13:29.852 --> 13:31.854
Now I know why.

13:33.856 --> 13:35.249
So what do you think?

13:42.778 --> 13:45.085
Had I known this would be
such a delicate procedure,

13:45.128 --> 13:46.826
I would have brought
my hemostatic clamps.

13:46.869 --> 13:48.392
A poor craftsman
blames his tools.

13:48.436 --> 13:51.265
If I mess this up, the only tool
I'm blaming is you.

13:53.267 --> 13:55.704
Would you look at that.
Hmm?

13:55.747 --> 13:58.489
This baby's both
a transmitter and a receiver.

13:58.533 --> 14:01.623
I wonder who this
walkie-ET-talkie calls out to.

14:01.666 --> 14:04.147
Can you focus, please?

14:04.191 --> 14:06.497
I've just got to
fuse this last piece.

14:06.541 --> 14:08.630
Keep those steady hands
steady and...

14:08.673 --> 14:10.632
All right.

14:12.895 --> 14:14.375
You can relax now.

14:14.418 --> 14:16.203
It's done.

14:18.988 --> 14:21.338
So what do we do now?

14:21.382 --> 14:23.558
Take cover.
Take cover!

14:30.957 --> 14:33.002
If you've figured out how to
extract this message

14:33.046 --> 14:35.352
from the glass, then
you've come too far.

14:35.396 --> 14:37.877
I probably only have
a few minutes

14:37.920 --> 14:40.009
before I slip out of lucidity.

14:40.053 --> 14:43.534
Ever since the crash of '47,
our family

14:43.578 --> 14:45.493
has chosen to protect
the Others.

14:45.536 --> 14:48.235
It seemed like the right
decision to protect those

14:48.278 --> 14:51.194
who are persecuted
for being different.

14:51.238 --> 14:54.545
But it wasn't.
Not for your grandfather.

14:54.589 --> 14:56.199
Not for me.

14:56.243 --> 14:59.724
Walk away, Kyle, because
the alternative is a sacrifice

14:59.768 --> 15:01.770
no more Valentis should make.

15:10.953 --> 15:13.825
Sorry for making a mess
of Guerin Grotto.

15:13.869 --> 15:16.916
First of all, it's a lair.

15:16.959 --> 15:19.048
Second, I am pretty sure
your dad told you

15:19.092 --> 15:20.397
to get the hell out of here.

15:20.441 --> 15:22.225
But I gotta imagine
my grandfather said

15:22.269 --> 15:24.314
the same thing to him,
and yet he stayed the course.

15:24.358 --> 15:26.099
And he died because of it.

15:27.274 --> 15:31.408
Sure, abandoning
oppressed people, harsh.

15:31.452 --> 15:35.935
But what's less harsh is,
I don't know... living!

15:35.978 --> 15:39.416
Don't you feel a sense
-of responsibility?
-To do what?!

15:39.460 --> 15:42.289
I'm gonna get in a rocket ship
that doesn't exist?

15:42.332 --> 15:44.421
Fly to a planet that's
God knows where

15:44.465 --> 15:46.162
into a war that's probably
long over?

15:46.206 --> 15:48.469
Face it, Valenti,

15:48.512 --> 15:50.862
I am as capable
of helping that planet

15:50.906 --> 15:52.516
as you are of helping us.

15:57.130 --> 15:59.219
I don't think I can
look my kids in the eye

15:59.262 --> 16:01.482
and tell 'em I walked away
from this.

16:11.144 --> 16:13.537
I gotta go.

16:20.718 --> 16:21.937
Here's an idea.

16:21.981 --> 16:24.244
You have someone
stashed in a cave

16:24.287 --> 16:25.636
who could help you find
the answers you've been

16:25.680 --> 16:27.464
searching for since
you were seven years old.

16:27.508 --> 16:29.162
How about you stop
licking your wounds

16:29.205 --> 16:30.641
and go talk to him.

16:35.037 --> 16:37.083
Thanks for taking pity on me.

16:37.126 --> 16:38.998
Oh, this is not pity.

16:39.041 --> 16:40.738
This is emergency assistance.

16:40.782 --> 16:43.045
Face it, having been friends
with Jordan is a cry for help.

16:45.482 --> 16:48.529
Liz told me that you and Rosa
used to be friends.

16:48.572 --> 16:51.010
She said that you guys
would hang out

16:51.053 --> 16:55.144
and listen to Nirvana,
and talk about art sometimes.

16:56.450 --> 16:58.452
I told her I
didn't get that.

16:58.495 --> 17:00.062
<i>Guüero</i> rancher with money

17:00.106 --> 17:01.411
and a Chicana
with secondhand sneaks.

17:01.455 --> 17:02.891
Well, what'd she say to that?

17:02.934 --> 17:05.676
Um...

17:05.720 --> 17:07.504
she said...

17:07.548 --> 17:10.681
<i>a veces en las piedras
crecen flores.</i>

17:11.552 --> 17:14.685
Sometimes flowers grow
through cracks in the cement.

17:14.729 --> 17:16.818
Good things can thrive,

17:16.861 --> 17:19.821
even when the world
around it is...

17:19.864 --> 17:22.302
Thick-headed and backwards?

17:24.086 --> 17:26.262
Adios me from the shop again,

17:26.306 --> 17:28.047
I might adios you
out of my country!

17:31.789 --> 17:33.574
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

17:35.228 --> 17:36.794
You're hanging out with her?

17:36.838 --> 17:37.882
So what?

17:37.926 --> 17:39.058
I should go.

17:39.101 --> 17:40.624
You should stay.

17:40.668 --> 17:42.148
Hey.

17:42.191 --> 17:43.236
You know,

17:43.279 --> 17:44.367
your mama made us promise

17:44.411 --> 17:45.586
not to tell you this,

17:45.629 --> 17:47.066
but enough's enough.

17:47.109 --> 17:49.372
Why don't you ask
your girlfriend here

17:49.416 --> 17:51.244
what happened to
your sister, huh?

17:52.332 --> 17:54.769
-She doesn't know.
-She's a lying piece of dirt.

17:54.812 --> 17:56.292
Just like the rest of 'em.

17:56.336 --> 17:58.816
Her family is the reason
your sister's dead, Wyatt.

18:01.471 --> 18:03.647
Her cousin killed Kate.

18:06.433 --> 18:08.609
Come on, Zeke, let's go.

18:22.797 --> 18:25.016
Okay, little-known fact.

18:25.060 --> 18:26.322
This is where Einstein came

18:26.366 --> 18:28.498
whenever he had
a crisis of faith.

18:28.542 --> 18:30.805
Voilà.

18:32.372 --> 18:33.808
There's no one dancing.

18:33.851 --> 18:35.810
That's the point.
Mm.

18:35.853 --> 18:38.508
More room for us.

18:42.991 --> 18:44.906
You know, you look a lot happier

18:44.949 --> 18:46.951
with that bullet wound fixed up.

18:46.995 --> 18:50.259
But Louise once told me that

18:50.303 --> 18:53.175
it's the accidents

18:53.219 --> 18:55.656
that change the course
of our lives.

18:55.699 --> 18:58.702
I think you might be
my happy accident, Lucky.

19:01.836 --> 19:03.316
Come on.

19:20.246 --> 19:21.421
Oh, I know.

19:21.464 --> 19:22.639
We share the same face.

19:22.683 --> 19:25.338
You'd think he would trust me.

19:27.601 --> 19:30.604
What do you say we show him
who I really am?

20:06.509 --> 20:07.902
How'd you find us?

20:08.685 --> 20:10.470
One road in, one road out.

20:12.820 --> 20:13.951
Give me the pod.

20:13.995 --> 20:15.475
It's not here.

20:19.740 --> 20:20.828
Oh.

20:20.871 --> 20:23.483
You're leaving
and taking him with you?

20:24.962 --> 20:26.834
I don't want to hurt you.

20:27.965 --> 20:29.228
Just give me the boy.

20:29.271 --> 20:31.360
We will never give him to you.

20:31.404 --> 20:33.014
After everything
that you have...

20:33.057 --> 20:34.407
Louise!

20:39.325 --> 20:41.283
<i>I love you.</i>

20:48.682 --> 20:51.293
So, you're gonna kill me now?

20:51.337 --> 20:52.990
No, but I told you,

20:53.034 --> 20:54.644
I just want my boy.

21:09.964 --> 21:13.272
So, every subconscious
thought we deal with

21:13.315 --> 21:16.405
gets us closer to accepting the
truth about the funeral vision.

21:16.449 --> 21:18.015
Well, in that case,

21:18.059 --> 21:19.669
I guess you should be
a little more forthcoming.

21:19.713 --> 21:22.368
Focus, ladies.
That was just the easy part.

21:24.848 --> 21:27.373
We're warming up
to the main event.

21:27.416 --> 21:30.027
Only two truths are left.

21:30.071 --> 21:32.203
You want truth, rabbit?

21:32.247 --> 21:35.555
Bronson died before my mother
gave birth to that baby.

21:35.598 --> 21:37.470
There's nothing I'm
suppressing there.

21:37.513 --> 21:39.080
Care to comment, Maria?

21:40.560 --> 21:43.476
Yeah, on the
creepy Evans twins.

21:46.305 --> 21:49.090
You want us to
deal you in, Iz?

21:49.133 --> 21:50.396
Should they, Iz?

21:50.439 --> 21:51.962
Okay, fine!

21:52.006 --> 21:53.529
Fine.

21:54.487 --> 21:56.010
Max is a clone.

21:56.053 --> 21:58.317
-What?
-Yeah, we found this guy Jones

21:58.360 --> 22:00.667
in a cave in the desert and...

22:00.710 --> 22:03.496
apparently he's, like, O.G. Max.

22:03.539 --> 22:04.888
We don't know if
he's good or bad,

22:04.932 --> 22:06.803
so we locked him
in an alien cage.

22:06.847 --> 22:09.458
Wait, I'm sorry, you kept
a man in a cage for a year?

22:09.502 --> 22:12.026
No, I mean, we kept
him in a stasis pod

22:12.069 --> 22:15.029
for, like, 51
and a half weeks.

22:15.072 --> 22:16.639
The cage has just been
the last few days.

22:16.683 --> 22:18.598
And of course you would
keep that to yourself.

22:18.641 --> 22:20.426
You know, it was
kind of an alien thing.

22:20.469 --> 22:22.819
I am an alien...

22:22.863 --> 22:25.387
ish.
Listen, we thought
he was dangerous.

22:25.431 --> 22:27.520
What do you mean "thought"?

22:27.563 --> 22:28.956
It's complicated.

22:28.999 --> 22:30.914
Okay, it's really not,
so just spit it out.

22:32.220 --> 22:34.744
Our mothers were
afraid of Jones.

22:38.487 --> 22:40.750
But he says that he cares
about Max.

22:40.794 --> 22:43.579
And I can feel that he...

22:43.623 --> 22:45.668
he's telling the truth.

22:45.712 --> 22:48.105
And I don't trust him.

22:48.149 --> 22:49.759
But... I don't know,

22:49.803 --> 22:51.413
I have this sense that

22:51.457 --> 22:53.633
there's something...

22:53.676 --> 22:56.679
I don't know how to describe it
other than to say...

22:58.725 --> 23:00.422
...he feels like family.

23:06.254 --> 23:08.125
Poof.

23:08.169 --> 23:11.302
One down...

23:11.346 --> 23:12.913
one to go.

23:42.464 --> 23:44.161
No, you're right, boy.

23:44.205 --> 23:46.512
This ain't good news.

24:00.830 --> 24:02.745
Salsa requires letting go.

24:02.789 --> 24:04.573
Relinquishing control
to your partner.

24:06.662 --> 24:08.621
♪ Side to side...

24:08.664 --> 24:10.579
And we both know
that's not really your thing.

24:14.757 --> 24:17.630
♪ Over and over...

24:27.335 --> 24:28.945
All right, Jones.

24:28.989 --> 24:31.034
I've been thinking
about what you said.

24:33.123 --> 24:35.038
Max!

24:37.824 --> 24:40.304
Hey! Wake up, dude. Hey.

24:40.348 --> 24:42.481
Hey.

24:42.524 --> 24:44.004
You good?

24:46.310 --> 24:48.487
What happened?

25:46.414 --> 25:48.242
You know, out there,
you actually

25:48.285 --> 25:49.939
let me take
the lead for once.

25:49.983 --> 25:52.028
Mm, do not get used to it.

25:52.072 --> 25:54.291
Salsa's not the same
thing as science.

25:54.335 --> 25:55.597
But I disagree.

25:55.641 --> 25:57.251
You just have to trust me
not to drop you

25:57.294 --> 25:58.687
on your head.

25:58.731 --> 26:00.428
That doesn't actually
make sense.

26:00.471 --> 26:02.038
All right.

26:02.082 --> 26:04.214
What I'm trying to say is...

26:04.258 --> 26:05.868
I got you.

26:05.912 --> 26:08.392
All right, you don't want to do
the important stuff in the lab?

26:08.436 --> 26:10.177
We do it off-book.

26:10.220 --> 26:12.092
How?

26:14.311 --> 26:16.139
We set up shop at your house.

26:16.183 --> 26:18.533
I call in
all of the favors

26:18.577 --> 26:21.231
with my tech buddy,
he firewalls everything.

26:21.275 --> 26:23.843
Genoryx will never know
what we create in there.

26:23.886 --> 26:25.932
Liz, you're brilliant.

26:26.802 --> 26:29.413
I mean, I'm just asking you
to trust your instincts.

26:35.332 --> 26:38.248
Okay, DeLuca,
spit it out.

26:38.292 --> 26:40.207
Why is my mother
in your head?

26:40.250 --> 26:41.904
You mean my great-grandmother

26:41.948 --> 26:43.732
and your sister Patricia?

26:43.776 --> 26:45.691
Yeah, tomato, tom-ah-to.

26:45.734 --> 26:47.431
Hardly.

26:47.475 --> 26:49.085
How can you not see that?

26:49.129 --> 26:50.521
I'm sorry, does this

26:50.565 --> 26:52.654
-have something to do with me?
-Yes!

26:52.698 --> 26:54.700
No, wait.

26:54.743 --> 26:56.397
I'm not sure.

26:56.440 --> 26:58.573
I don't have a lot
of family, but...

26:58.617 --> 27:00.357
my mom needs me
more than ever.

27:00.401 --> 27:02.446
I'm not normal enough
to be human, but apparently

27:02.490 --> 27:04.753
I'm not alien enough
to be part of the alien gang.

27:04.797 --> 27:06.755
I just...

27:06.799 --> 27:09.540
I don't know...

27:09.584 --> 27:10.803
Lonely.

27:12.456 --> 27:14.894
What, you're
queen of feelings now?

27:16.373 --> 27:18.201
How did you not know that?

27:18.245 --> 27:19.768
I don't know,
you know, in my defense,

27:19.812 --> 27:22.510
I've have this new ability
for, like, 36 hours.

27:22.553 --> 27:24.686
Ever since I found out
about Louise,

27:24.730 --> 27:28.124
I just... I wanted to feel
some type of connection.

27:28.168 --> 27:30.039
And your only connection

27:30.083 --> 27:31.867
is through me.

27:33.521 --> 27:36.132
And I haven't exactly
been including you.

27:36.176 --> 27:37.917
In fact, I've been

27:37.960 --> 27:40.310
-actively excluding.
-Yeah.

27:40.354 --> 27:42.182
-Criticizing.

27:42.225 --> 27:43.531
-Antagonizing.
-Irritating.

27:43.574 --> 27:46.142
Just not treating you
like family.

27:46.186 --> 27:47.883
It would just be nice to know

27:47.927 --> 27:49.842
what planet
my great-grandmother's from.

27:51.017 --> 27:53.759
Well... you know what?

27:53.802 --> 27:55.151
Why don't we solve this?

27:55.195 --> 27:56.326
And then let's talk about it

27:56.370 --> 27:57.893
over some acetone margaritas?

27:57.937 --> 27:59.678
Okay.

28:01.854 --> 28:03.159
Congrats, ladies.

28:03.203 --> 28:04.552
You did it.

28:18.914 --> 28:20.655
Whew! "Find My Friends"

28:20.699 --> 28:22.875
should be called
"Find My Intergalactic Enemy."

28:22.918 --> 28:24.528
Dude, I've felt...

28:24.572 --> 28:26.313
I've felt how strong he is, man.

28:26.356 --> 28:28.271
He is stronger than all of us.

28:28.315 --> 28:30.143
Well...

28:30.186 --> 28:31.753
lucky for us,

28:31.797 --> 28:34.756
I got a long history...

28:34.800 --> 28:37.367
of fighting someone
with your face.

28:42.111 --> 28:44.853
Told you they'd come, boy.

28:46.159 --> 28:47.377
What are you doing here?

28:47.421 --> 28:48.727
Thinking.

28:48.770 --> 28:50.859
Plenty of quiet time
in your cage.

28:50.903 --> 28:54.863
You know, when you keep things
locked up, you create monsters,

28:54.907 --> 28:56.430
Michael.

28:59.476 --> 29:01.783
You know, I thought
about running.

29:01.827 --> 29:05.091
But then I remembered why I
came here in the first place.

29:07.789 --> 29:09.399
I've seen who you've become,

29:09.443 --> 29:11.793
Max, and you're
a good man.

29:11.837 --> 29:14.578
You deserve the life
I came here to give you.

29:14.622 --> 29:15.928
And what life is that?

29:15.971 --> 29:17.146
A healthy one.

29:17.190 --> 29:19.366
I've seen your X-rays.

29:19.409 --> 29:22.064
There's
a lot of people

29:22.108 --> 29:23.544
who will miss you.

29:23.587 --> 29:25.198
I mean, Liz Ortecho for one.

29:25.241 --> 29:27.374
You leave Liz out of this.

29:28.854 --> 29:31.508
I understand why you doubt me.

29:32.509 --> 29:35.730
I, uh, I remember Tripp.

29:36.949 --> 29:39.603
That's why I wanted to give you
my side of the story.

29:39.647 --> 29:40.909
What's he talking about?

29:40.953 --> 29:42.650
I dug up

29:42.693 --> 29:45.261
just enough strength
to give him one memory.

29:45.305 --> 29:47.263
So he could make
his own decision.

29:47.307 --> 29:48.917
About what?

29:48.961 --> 29:50.397
His heart.

29:50.440 --> 29:52.355
Now...

29:52.399 --> 29:54.444
will you trust me enough

29:54.488 --> 29:56.272
to let me heal you?

29:56.316 --> 29:58.361
You're not strong enough
for that.

29:59.449 --> 30:01.495
Lucky seems to be doing
just fine.

30:03.584 --> 30:05.368
Look, no offense
to Lucky, but...

30:05.412 --> 30:07.153
it's different with people.

30:07.196 --> 30:08.632
Okay, I mean, you could die.

30:08.676 --> 30:10.504
And in doing so, make amends

30:10.547 --> 30:12.854
for all the pain
I've caused in my life.

30:13.986 --> 30:15.465
Let me help you,

30:15.509 --> 30:18.251
Max.
Why? Why?

30:18.294 --> 30:21.384
Because in-in 1948,
you were searching for me?

30:21.428 --> 30:23.604
Nothing you showed me

30:23.647 --> 30:25.171
convinces me of anything else.

30:25.214 --> 30:27.651
Then let me show you the rest.

30:29.218 --> 30:30.959
Don't.

30:31.003 --> 30:34.006
He can't fake a memory.

31:15.612 --> 31:17.571
<i>You set me up.</i>

31:18.615 --> 31:20.530
One road in, one road out.

31:20.574 --> 31:22.054
Where is he?

31:22.097 --> 31:23.272
Where is my boy?

31:23.316 --> 31:24.360
We moved him.

31:24.404 --> 31:25.927
In one piece?

31:25.971 --> 31:27.102
Or in many?

31:27.146 --> 31:28.625
I saw those tools
in there.

31:28.669 --> 31:29.844
What did you do to him?

31:29.888 --> 31:32.325
-We're trying to fix him.
-So stop!

31:32.368 --> 31:34.414
Just give him to me.

31:35.719 --> 31:37.721
We are two halves of a whole.

31:37.765 --> 31:39.593
Without me, he'll...

31:44.032 --> 31:47.166
I want a chance
to do this right.

31:50.821 --> 31:53.215
You know what happens
to the child if you kill me.

31:53.259 --> 31:55.522
Who said you're gonna die
tonight?

31:58.394 --> 32:00.092
That empty pod in there.

32:00.135 --> 32:02.137
That's for me.

32:27.554 --> 32:29.121
I just want my child.

32:42.961 --> 32:45.137
Can he survive without him?

32:47.356 --> 32:49.184
I don't know.

32:55.234 --> 32:57.758
I'm ready to go back to my cage.

32:59.542 --> 33:03.111
And I'm ready
to set you free, Max.

33:13.426 --> 33:15.994
Hi.
Hi.

33:16.037 --> 33:18.648
Thank you for coming, I...Y-You don't have
to explain.

33:18.692 --> 33:20.041
I, uh...

33:20.085 --> 33:21.695
know why you ran.

33:21.738 --> 33:23.436
You do?

33:23.479 --> 33:25.264
♪ Could you resist...

33:25.307 --> 33:27.527
I googled myself.

33:28.310 --> 33:30.834
I found my YouTube page,

33:30.878 --> 33:32.488
and there were
all these videos

33:32.532 --> 33:34.360
about your cousin
and your family,

33:34.403 --> 33:37.232
and about how Mexicans
don't belong in America, and...

33:39.669 --> 33:42.063
That's why you didn't tell me
about your cousin, isn't it?

33:42.107 --> 33:45.240
You were afraid
of what I might do.

33:48.983 --> 33:50.941
You shot up our diner, Wyatt.

33:50.985 --> 33:53.379
You attacked my uncle.

33:53.422 --> 33:56.164
I don't know how
you're so different now.

33:56.208 --> 33:58.253
It doesn't make sense.

33:59.646 --> 34:01.517
Why are you even talking to me?

34:01.561 --> 34:03.867
Because...

34:03.911 --> 34:05.695
because I know what it's like

34:05.739 --> 34:09.047
to wake up one day and not know
what happened to your life.

34:11.484 --> 34:14.182
I have been in recovery

34:14.226 --> 34:16.271
for a year now,
but sometimes

34:16.315 --> 34:18.491
I still feel like I'm just...

34:18.534 --> 34:20.710
convincing myself
that I'm somebody that I'm not.

34:24.758 --> 34:26.673
But, no, I-I...

34:26.716 --> 34:30.155
No, I know that's not true
because...

34:30.198 --> 34:32.548
if people can't change,

34:32.592 --> 34:35.856
if we can't become
who we want to be, then...

34:37.162 --> 34:39.381
...what is the point
of any of this?

34:40.991 --> 34:43.603
Wow, that's...

34:43.646 --> 34:46.258
probably kinder than I deserve.

34:49.087 --> 34:53.047
I'm so sorry, Rosalinda.

34:53.091 --> 34:55.049
I'm sorry, too.

34:55.093 --> 34:57.225
I'm sorry about your sister.

34:57.269 --> 34:59.793
It wasn't your fault.

35:05.886 --> 35:08.628
I think I need some time away
from this place.

35:08.671 --> 35:12.588
Need to figure out who-who I am
and who I want to be, you know?

35:19.117 --> 35:21.597
He asked to keep
the harmonica.

35:21.641 --> 35:24.470
Figured there'd be no harm
in that.

35:28.561 --> 35:30.606
You gonna tell me what you saw?

35:32.391 --> 35:34.523
1948.

35:36.482 --> 35:39.615
He was hunting Nora and Louise
just like Tripp said,

35:39.659 --> 35:42.314
but he didn't want
to hurt me.

35:43.184 --> 35:45.534
He wanted to save me from them.

35:46.318 --> 35:48.189
I could feel his pain

35:48.233 --> 35:50.583
right before they trapped him
in the pod.

35:51.410 --> 35:53.673
He thinks of me like a son.

35:54.500 --> 35:56.241
That mean you want
to let him heal you?

35:58.243 --> 36:00.158
I don't know, man.

36:01.898 --> 36:03.378
I don't trust him.

36:05.163 --> 36:07.252
But I can't tell if that's
because I don't like

36:07.295 --> 36:08.862
what he said about my mom.

36:10.864 --> 36:13.867
I know it isn't my fault
who my dad was.

36:16.174 --> 36:17.479
But I still feel
a responsibility

36:17.523 --> 36:19.264
to somehow fix what he broke.

36:19.307 --> 36:21.701
Seems like Jones feels
that way about you.

36:23.268 --> 36:24.573
It's your choice,

36:24.617 --> 36:27.228
but if you're game,
I will back you.

36:31.363 --> 36:34.888
<i>Well, we faced our
fears in subconscious land.</i>

36:34.931 --> 36:38.152
<i>Let's face what's left
in your funeral vision.</i>

36:38.196 --> 36:39.545
<i>Of course I'm upset.</i>

36:39.588 --> 36:41.329
This is like Noah
all over again.

36:41.373 --> 36:43.549
We're covering up a murder.

36:44.332 --> 36:46.595
It's still so blurry.

36:47.596 --> 36:48.989
This is all my fault.

36:49.032 --> 36:50.164
Not this time, DeLuca.

36:50.208 --> 36:51.731
We'll figure this out
together.

36:55.517 --> 36:57.606
Everything is coming into focus
thanks to you.

36:57.650 --> 36:59.565
I have two theories already.

36:59.608 --> 37:02.220
Ah, so we have made peace
with LA,

37:02.263 --> 37:04.526
and our plan to save the world.

37:04.570 --> 37:07.312
I've made peace with myself.

37:08.313 --> 37:10.837
I've decided to resign.

37:19.585 --> 37:23.153
Where are you off to
in such a hurry, Valenti?

37:23.197 --> 37:24.242
I'm gonna see the sheriff.

37:24.285 --> 37:25.982
Let her know

37:26.026 --> 37:28.420
about what you and your buddy
Zeke did over at the Lopez farm.

37:29.595 --> 37:31.466
Oh, she ain't ever gonna
listen to you, Kyle.

37:31.510 --> 37:34.034
She's not a bleeding heart
liberal like your mother.

37:35.340 --> 37:37.646
For I am convinced...

37:37.690 --> 37:39.779
What do you see
that's new here?

37:39.822 --> 37:42.129
...that neither death
nor life...

37:42.172 --> 37:44.174
If the sheriff's office
had done something

37:44.218 --> 37:45.393
the day I complained,

37:45.437 --> 37:47.569
they could've prevented this.

37:47.613 --> 37:50.572
...neither the present... Bert is with Michael.

37:50.616 --> 37:52.270
So it's not Guerin's funeral.

37:52.313 --> 37:54.272
He defended him yesterday
at the drive-in.

37:54.315 --> 37:55.664
Oh, but I got to
believe Sheriff Taylor

37:55.708 --> 37:57.100
still believes in justice.

37:57.144 --> 37:59.059
But if she won't do anything,
I will.

37:59.102 --> 38:01.757
Why do you got to be
such a pain in my ass, Valenti?

38:01.801 --> 38:04.194
Guys like you ain't the problem.
You're a doctor.

38:04.238 --> 38:06.545
You're not the one
sucking the system dry like...

38:06.588 --> 38:08.895
These hardworking people
who it's designed to beat down?

38:08.938 --> 38:10.288
Hmm?

38:11.071 --> 38:13.595
Look, Liz,
just think about this, okay?

38:13.639 --> 38:14.944
There's consequence here.

38:14.988 --> 38:17.599
I have, yes.
And if Genoryx discovers

38:17.643 --> 38:19.558
that we are hiding our work
from them,

38:19.601 --> 38:21.995
they will take it from us,
legally.

38:22.038 --> 38:23.388
They're not...

38:23.431 --> 38:24.780
And we won't be able to help

38:24.824 --> 38:26.173
the people we did this for
in the first place.

38:26.216 --> 38:27.914
Heath,
I have been searching

38:27.957 --> 38:32.614
for a way to do good
without harm,

38:32.658 --> 38:35.443
and I think leaving Genoryx
is the first step.

38:35.487 --> 38:37.793
Neither life...

38:39.273 --> 38:41.319
...nor death,

38:41.362 --> 38:43.103
nor anything else...

38:43.146 --> 38:45.018
Oh, my God.

38:46.628 --> 38:48.064
Is this Liz's funeral?

38:51.981 --> 38:54.549
Okay, what about the-the...
the funding, all right?

38:54.593 --> 38:56.856
-The equipment?
-I will figure it out.

38:58.205 --> 39:01.469
I need to trust people,
but it has to be the right ones.

39:01.513 --> 39:03.297
I have put my faith
in Genoryx

39:03.341 --> 39:07.040
when I should have been looking
to the people I care about.

39:07.083 --> 39:09.782
I... have people.

39:12.219 --> 39:13.394
You know what?

39:15.048 --> 39:18.051
And now Max Evans would
like to share a few words.

39:25.406 --> 39:28.409
I can't. I can't.

39:39.159 --> 39:40.943
-Well, at least we
know it's not Liz.

39:48.037 --> 39:49.909
<i>"Canción Mixteca."</i>

39:52.433 --> 39:54.130
You know,

39:54.174 --> 39:56.742
your family's been a problem
for mine for a long time.

39:56.785 --> 39:58.787
Tell me you ain't gonna be
like your stubborn old man.

39:58.831 --> 40:01.486
Like your nosy bitch
of a mother.

40:01.529 --> 40:03.488
'Cause if you are,

40:03.531 --> 40:06.360
I'm gonna make your job
much more difficult.
