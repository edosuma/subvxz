<i>Previously on "The Company You Keep"...</i>

00:02.864 --> 00:04.832
<i>Did you know
about daddy dearest?</i>

00:04.832 --> 00:08.077
If the Feds stay on me,
I will expose your family

00:08.077 --> 00:09.768
for the frauds you really are.

00:09.768 --> 00:11.045
There is another answer.

00:11.045 --> 00:12.840
If you come work
for me as my asset,

00:12.840 --> 00:14.945
I'’ll protect your family
while you help me protect mine.

00:14.945 --> 00:18.052
We'’re CIA informants, son.
You should have asked us first.

00:18.052 --> 00:21.159
For once, Charlie'’s love life
may solve our problems.

00:21.159 --> 00:22.746
I wanted to introduce you

00:22.746 --> 00:25.335
to your new director
of social media, Jennifer West.

00:25.335 --> 00:27.682
Usual deal?
- I make money, you make money.

00:27.682 --> 00:30.720
Hey, how did your dad
get into our line of work?

00:30.720 --> 00:32.860
Job dried up,
pension along with it.

00:32.860 --> 00:34.862
It'’s early-stage memory loss.
That'’s it.

00:34.862 --> 00:37.623
We can'’t pretend this
isn'’t happening, babe.

00:42.628 --> 00:45.183
<i>Daphne Finch became
the de facto head</i>

00:45.183 --> 00:46.736
<i>of the Maguire crime syndicate</i>

00:46.736 --> 00:49.635
<i>when her father, Patrick,
was arrested.</i>

00:49.635 --> 00:51.534
<i>Since then,
she'’s managed to corner</i>

00:51.534 --> 00:53.570
<i>and grow the East Coast
fentanyl market</i>

00:53.570 --> 00:55.745
<i>by taking on
the distribution network</i>

00:55.745 --> 00:57.885
<i>of the Taiwanese triads.</i>

00:57.885 --> 01:01.751
<i>Using that revenue, she
began buying illegal weapons,</i>

01:01.751 --> 01:04.547
<i>increasing the supply
to her Russian partners</i>

01:04.547 --> 01:06.376
<i>and providing enough
for them to export</i>

01:06.376 --> 01:08.827
<i>to combat zones
across the world.</i>

01:08.827 --> 01:11.105
<i>Ms. Finch applied
her knowledge</i>

01:11.105 --> 01:12.555
<i>of corporate synergy</i>

01:12.555 --> 01:14.384
<i>to markets
once controlled by gangs.</i>

01:14.384 --> 01:18.388
<i>More drugs equals more guns
equals more drugs.</i>

01:18.388 --> 01:21.081
<i>The problem is,
her finances are hidden to us,</i>

01:21.081 --> 01:24.084
<i>thanks to the tax loophole
of a so-called Freeport.</i>

01:24.084 --> 01:26.983
<i>But none of her expansion
would have been possible</i>

01:26.983 --> 01:28.640
<i>without the cooperation</i>

01:28.640 --> 01:30.849
<i>of individuals working
within the highest levels</i>

01:30.849 --> 01:33.093
<i>of our nation'’s
defense systems.</i>

01:35.025 --> 01:38.615
We'’re talking corruption
on an Iran-Contra Affair scale.

01:41.446 --> 01:42.861
But here'’s the scary part--

01:42.861 --> 01:45.277
I don'’t think Daphne Finch
is done yet.

01:46.451 --> 01:48.418
She'’s nothing
if not ambitious.

01:48.418 --> 01:51.111
I'’d like to file a cable
and bring Langley up to speed
on our operation.

01:51.111 --> 01:53.009
By all means.
And nice work, Hill.

01:53.009 --> 01:56.461
It seems your asset
is really paying dividends.

01:59.809 --> 02:01.086
You okay?

02:02.156 --> 02:04.848
Yeah. I was thinking
how good it'’s going to feel

02:04.848 --> 02:08.369
when we put Maguire away
for good, and Daphne with him.

02:08.369 --> 02:11.614
So we'’re arms dealers now.

02:11.614 --> 02:13.478
But thanks
to our new partners--

02:13.478 --> 02:18.345
members of Congress,
the Undersecretary of Defense--

02:18.345 --> 02:19.760
totally untouchable.

02:21.382 --> 02:23.833
Not bad.

02:23.833 --> 02:27.319
And Connor told me he'’s making
connections in Mexico.

02:27.940 --> 02:29.356
Has he?

02:29.356 --> 02:32.669
Well, then you also know
he took the $10 million

02:32.669 --> 02:35.396
I was hoping to reinvest
into our expansion

02:35.396 --> 02:37.709
for a drug-buying spree.

02:37.709 --> 02:40.298
Bit of bad blood
between you two, isn'’t there?

02:40.298 --> 02:42.921
Well, you keeping me a secret

02:42.921 --> 02:44.164
certainly hasn'’t helped.

02:44.164 --> 02:45.682
But unlike Connor,

02:45.682 --> 02:48.306
I haven'’t let that bad blood
stand in the way

02:48.306 --> 02:50.308
of successfully running
your empire.

02:54.760 --> 02:57.004
I'’m not going
to play favorites

02:57.004 --> 02:58.833
when it comes to my children.

02:58.833 --> 03:02.803
But I'’d certainly be grateful
to whoever gets me out of here.

03:03.459 --> 03:04.874
Already on it.

03:06.255 --> 03:07.670
What is this?

03:07.670 --> 03:10.569
Details for an anonymous
offshore bank account.

03:10.569 --> 03:13.848
You'’ll get full access
to the money inside

03:13.848 --> 03:16.851
if you agree to release
my client.

03:19.233 --> 03:22.271
According to my sources,
this amount'’s considerably more

03:22.271 --> 03:25.481
than what you'’ve taken
in the past for such favors.

03:26.275 --> 03:28.518
I do not barter
with criminals.

03:32.039 --> 03:34.352
From what my lawyers
tell me,

03:34.352 --> 03:36.561
it'’ll take a bit of magic

03:36.561 --> 03:39.978
to get this judge
to change his mind.

03:39.978 --> 03:41.600
Well, lucky for you...

03:42.567 --> 03:45.535
I'’ve got a magician
on the payroll.

03:57.409 --> 03:59.825
Come on in.
It'’s my new place.

04:01.275 --> 04:02.759
Oh.

04:02.759 --> 04:04.796
It'’s a lot less drafty
than the warehouse.

04:04.796 --> 04:06.556
Sure is.

04:06.556 --> 04:08.903
Would you like a drink?

04:08.903 --> 04:10.491
A little early for me.

04:11.354 --> 04:12.735
All right.

04:12.735 --> 04:14.771
It'’s 5:00 somewhere.

04:15.945 --> 04:17.671
You know I'’m not one
for praise,

04:17.671 --> 04:19.742
but our working relationship

04:19.742 --> 04:22.123
has proven even more profitable

04:22.123 --> 04:23.780
than I could have hoped.

04:23.780 --> 04:25.679
Our deal was for me to help
you take down your brother,

04:25.679 --> 04:27.267
not pay your mortgage.

04:27.267 --> 04:28.647
Come on.

04:28.647 --> 04:30.856
You have to admit,
we make a great team.

04:30.856 --> 04:33.583
<i>Is that what
we are now-- a team?</i>

04:33.583 --> 04:35.930
<i>What would you call it?</i>
- This is uncomfortable.

04:35.930 --> 04:37.000
Uncomfortable?

04:37.000 --> 04:38.761
Why should this
be uncomfortable?

04:38.761 --> 04:40.349
Charlie'’s job is to win
Daphne'’s trust.

04:40.349 --> 04:41.764
Sounds like it'’s working.

04:41.764 --> 04:43.213
It sounds like she'’s feeling

04:43.213 --> 04:44.870
a little more for him
than trust these days.

04:44.870 --> 04:47.287
Really, it'’s fine.
I'’m fine.

04:48.460 --> 04:50.290
Does your face know that?

04:53.154 --> 04:54.811
Look...

04:54.811 --> 04:57.158
if working together
is going to be a problem--

04:57.158 --> 04:59.816
It'’s not. I'm just protective
of my brother.

05:01.577 --> 05:03.372
If I'’m being honest,

05:03.372 --> 05:05.443
I don'’t love how you've been
treating him lately either.

05:08.308 --> 05:09.895
I'’m just doing my job, too,

05:09.895 --> 05:12.898
which in part, believe it
or not, is to protect him.

05:15.556 --> 05:18.663
So you just bring me
down here to what?

05:18.663 --> 05:21.079
Show off your new place?

05:21.079 --> 05:23.392
I brought you here
because I want your help

05:23.392 --> 05:25.048
getting my father
out of prison.

05:25.048 --> 05:26.740
<i>Prison breaks
aren'’t really my thing.</i>

05:26.740 --> 05:28.086
<i>Don'’t be so dramatic.</i>

05:28.086 --> 05:29.915
I just need you to put
a little pressure

05:29.915 --> 05:33.816
on our friendly neighborhood
D.C. Circuit judge.

05:33.816 --> 05:36.163
I promise I'’ll make it
worth your while.

05:37.992 --> 05:40.547
♪ It ain'’t every day... ♪

05:40.547 --> 05:45.206
Yeah! Take that, Davey,
you sorry son of a bitch!

05:45.206 --> 05:47.381
All right,
who wants another round?
I'’m buying.

05:47.381 --> 05:48.831
Come on, Franny.
Line them up.

05:48.831 --> 05:51.109
There you go, baby.

05:51.109 --> 05:55.596
Yeah.
United Steelworkers Local 2609.

05:55.596 --> 05:57.667
- Yeah.
- We lost a loyal brother.

05:57.667 --> 06:00.360
- Yeah.
- To Maurice.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.671
all: To Maurice!

06:01.671 --> 06:03.570
To Maurice. Maurice.

06:04.709 --> 06:06.676
- Who was it this time?
- Shelby'’s father.

06:06.676 --> 06:07.953
- Oh, no.
- Yeah.

06:07.953 --> 06:09.852
I'’ll get you one, too, baby.

06:09.852 --> 06:12.475
But I got to start
cutting your father off.

06:13.062 --> 06:14.235
How did he go?

06:14.235 --> 06:16.445
A heart attack got him
before the cancer did.

06:16.445 --> 06:17.791
Jesus, mom, that'’s grim.

06:17.791 --> 06:19.413
Yeah, you'’re damn
right it'’s grim.

06:19.413 --> 06:21.208
You realize that
most of these dudes

06:21.208 --> 06:24.867
haven'’t work for 20 years since
the steel mill closed down?

06:24.867 --> 06:26.213
Grim.

06:26.213 --> 06:28.146
Hey, Fran, take it easy.
It'’s not even after noon.

06:28.146 --> 06:29.596
You'’re right--
someone'’s got to be

06:29.596 --> 06:30.873
the grown-up
around here, right?

06:30.873 --> 06:32.530
Oh, speaking of...

06:32.530 --> 06:34.394
- Hmm?
- I need you to do me a favor.

06:34.394 --> 06:36.706
Tomorrow your dad has to go
to the neurologist,

06:36.706 --> 06:38.777
and you know how
he hates doctors.

06:38.777 --> 06:40.123
Can you make sure
he gets there on time?

06:40.123 --> 06:41.711
Yeah, of course.
Yeah, yeah. No, I got it.

06:41.711 --> 06:43.092
- Thanks, baby.
- Yeah, no problem.

06:43.092 --> 06:45.405
Yeah. No, you didn'’t!

06:45.405 --> 06:46.647
Hey.

06:46.647 --> 06:48.856
- How'’d it go?
- It went.

06:50.271 --> 06:52.412
- Hey, Fran.
- Hey.

06:53.102 --> 06:54.414
Hey, Leo.

06:56.933 --> 06:58.728
You got to forgive
my husband, hon.

06:58.728 --> 07:00.937
He has an allergy to G men.

07:02.594 --> 07:05.977
- Can we debrief?
- Yeah, we'’ll go downstairs.
Come on.

07:05.977 --> 07:07.841
Can you take it outside, son?

07:08.669 --> 07:10.430
Private party.

07:16.470 --> 07:18.472
Look, my parents, they--

07:18.472 --> 07:19.646
It'’s fine.

07:19.646 --> 07:21.924
No, you don'’t understand.

07:21.924 --> 07:24.098
When my mom'’s folks owned
the tailor shop here

07:24.098 --> 07:26.135
back in the '’30s,
it was the cops

07:26.135 --> 07:27.930
who were shaking them down
for free suits,

07:27.930 --> 07:29.863
while the wise guys were
the ones dropping off groceries

07:29.863 --> 07:31.485
- when times got tough.
- Mm.

07:31.485 --> 07:34.108
Explains why you'’re
so comfortable around crime.

07:36.145 --> 07:37.940
I'’m sorry--
aren'’t you the one

07:37.940 --> 07:39.873
who'’s trying to get Maguire
back on the streets?

07:39.873 --> 07:42.496
Only so I can put him away
for good.

07:42.496 --> 07:44.394
That'’s logical.

07:45.637 --> 07:49.607
So what'’s your plan to get
Daphne'’s father out of prison?

07:49.607 --> 07:50.953
Keep an eye on the judge.

07:50.953 --> 07:52.610
Get him on tape
doing something dirty.

07:52.610 --> 07:55.026
That way she can flip him
and free Maguire.

07:55.026 --> 07:56.786
Hey, do you think it'’s strange

07:56.786 --> 07:59.789
that both you and Daphne
want the same thing?

07:59.789 --> 08:01.619
I want to end the Maguires.

08:01.619 --> 08:04.553
That'’s still the same thing
you want, isn'’t it, Charlie?

08:04.553 --> 08:05.657
You'’re damn right.

08:16.392 --> 08:17.807
- Hey.
- Hi.

08:17.807 --> 08:20.154
Well, no old pictures
of me and Claire Fox

08:20.154 --> 08:21.535
on the front page.

08:21.535 --> 08:23.226
Am I to assume you found a way

08:23.226 --> 08:25.677
around our family'’s
blackmail problem?

08:29.198 --> 08:32.201
- Oh. Ah, the circus has arrived!
- Hi!

08:33.651 --> 08:35.238
How'’s life
on the campaign trail?

08:35.238 --> 08:37.447
If I have to hear myself give
that stump speech

08:37.447 --> 08:38.759
one more time...

08:38.759 --> 08:40.381
- David crushed it.
- Of course he did.

08:40.381 --> 08:43.005
This trip brought the
momentum we need for November.

08:43.005 --> 08:45.559
Still, weeks of napping
on a campaign bus--

08:45.559 --> 08:47.250
not going to miss
that neck pain.

08:47.250 --> 08:48.838
I told you--yoga.

08:48.838 --> 08:51.841
Maybe you can show me again.

08:51.841 --> 08:53.360
Well, I'’m beat.

08:53.360 --> 08:56.846
- Come on,
I'’ll walk you to the car.
- Yep.

08:56.846 --> 08:59.228
Thank you again
for the vote of confidence.

08:59.228 --> 09:01.023
You know I got you, baby.

09:01.023 --> 09:03.197
How long'’s
that been going on?

09:03.197 --> 09:06.269
Spokane,
or was it Walla Walla?

09:06.269 --> 09:08.686
She seems good for him.

09:08.686 --> 09:09.756
Clearly.

09:12.206 --> 09:14.105
They actually make
a great team.

09:14.105 --> 09:15.278
Reminds me of us.

09:17.591 --> 09:19.731
How is this different?

09:20.525 --> 09:22.734
It'’s different because...

09:24.011 --> 09:27.118
Jen was hired
because of Claire Fox.

09:28.602 --> 09:32.399
I thought that woman was
done trying to ruin our family.

09:38.129 --> 09:40.510
♪ Oh, please forgive me

09:41.650 --> 09:43.790
- Hey. Good morning.
- Hey.

09:43.790 --> 09:45.895
I got this.
You got Pop'’s thing.

09:45.895 --> 09:48.484
No, no, he--he told me the
appointment got rescheduled.

09:48.484 --> 09:50.417
- What?
- Yeah.

09:50.417 --> 09:52.902
No, I just talked to Ma.
She said he was
on his way here to meet you.

09:52.902 --> 09:54.663
Wait, what? When?

09:55.456 --> 09:56.630
Hold on.
I got him.

09:56.630 --> 09:58.356
What do you mean you got him?

09:58.356 --> 09:59.633
I mean I got him.

10:01.117 --> 10:03.326
Oh. Does he know
you'’re tracking him?

10:03.326 --> 10:05.639
I'’ll apologize
when we find him.

10:05.639 --> 10:08.366
- God, where the hell is he?
- That'’s the middle of nowhere.

10:08.366 --> 10:10.955
- What'’s Pop doing in Virginia?
- I don'’t know.

10:10.955 --> 10:12.646
Ma said he was getting worse.

10:12.646 --> 10:14.614
I'’m going to take this.

10:14.614 --> 10:17.168
Call Ma, let her know what'’s
going on, and I'’ll go find him.

10:17.168 --> 10:18.272
Yeah.

10:22.829 --> 10:25.107
<i>Any luck?</i>
- Yeah, I got him.

10:25.107 --> 10:27.523
<i>Thank God.
Is he okay?</i>

10:27.523 --> 10:31.665
Other than the fact I'’m going
to kill him, he looks fine.

10:32.977 --> 10:34.910
Yeah, I'’ll call you later.

10:38.534 --> 10:39.846
Nice shoes.

10:39.846 --> 10:41.951
- What are you doing here?
- What am I do--

10:41.951 --> 10:43.401
I'’m not the one
that'’s supposed to be

10:43.401 --> 10:45.472
at a doctor'’s appointment
right now.

10:45.472 --> 10:46.680
Yeah, well...

10:48.337 --> 10:49.959
something came up.

10:49.959 --> 10:52.410
Wait. Hold on. Is that
the guy from the dartboard?

10:52.410 --> 10:55.068
Davey Slocum.

10:55.068 --> 10:57.173
That'’s the gentleman
who lost my pension.

10:57.173 --> 10:59.037
Goes by David
now that he'’s running

10:59.037 --> 11:00.660
with the country-club crowd.

11:00.660 --> 11:01.833
Hold on a second.

11:01.833 --> 11:04.008
Are you running
a job right now?

11:04.008 --> 11:05.319
It'’s what we do.

11:05.319 --> 11:07.149
No, no,
it'’s what we do together,

11:07.149 --> 11:08.737
not behind each other'’s backs.

11:08.737 --> 11:10.393
Oh, well,
you'’ve been busy lately.

11:10.393 --> 11:13.569
So feel free to help me squeeze
the 208 grand he owes me.

11:13.569 --> 11:14.984
I'’m sorry. What?

11:14.984 --> 11:16.192
That'’s what my retirement
would be worth

11:16.192 --> 11:17.815
if old Davey hadn'’t blown it.

11:17.815 --> 11:19.540
Okay, and you thought
today is the perfect day

11:19.540 --> 11:21.197
to settle that score?

11:21.197 --> 11:23.268
Just days
after my friend died?

11:24.373 --> 11:26.962
Yeah, timing
couldn'’t be more perfect.

11:28.549 --> 11:30.172
So you in, or you out?

11:30.172 --> 11:32.726
'’Cause either way,
I'’m getting what's mine.

11:40.389 --> 11:42.011
<i>Didn'’t realize you and I
were teaming up on this one.</i>

11:42.011 --> 11:44.082
Uh, did Charlie brief you
on the plan?

11:44.082 --> 11:46.119
Yes, uh, flip a judge,

11:46.119 --> 11:48.052
break an Irish gangster
out of prison--

11:48.052 --> 11:50.192
just another Tuesday, Logistics.

11:54.230 --> 11:55.542
Whoa, whoa!

11:55.542 --> 11:58.200
Oh, hey, my drive pulled
an Amelia Earhart on me--

11:58.200 --> 12:00.236
took off nice
and then disappeared.

12:00.236 --> 12:02.204
- I'’m so sorry to hang you up.
- I found it.

12:02.204 --> 12:04.862
- It--it went sailing.
- Yeah, I know.

12:04.862 --> 12:07.278
- Excuse us. Sorry.
- Hey, it happens.

12:07.278 --> 12:08.900
Slocum.
David Slocum.

12:08.900 --> 12:11.109
Carson Stiles.

12:11.109 --> 12:13.733
- Is that a Royal Oak?
- That'’s a good eye.

12:13.733 --> 12:15.389
That'’s, uh--that's a beauty.

12:15.389 --> 12:18.496
Yeah, it'’s a little
retirement present for myself.

12:18.496 --> 12:19.773
Ha.

12:19.773 --> 12:21.292
Say, instead
of holding each other up,

12:21.292 --> 12:24.295
you want to finish
the back nine as a twosome?

12:24.295 --> 12:25.434
Why not?

12:25.434 --> 12:26.884
You got it.

12:26.884 --> 12:28.506
Driver, please.

12:28.506 --> 12:30.888
That guy'’s wearing my pension
on his wrist.

12:30.888 --> 12:32.752
You sure you'’re up for this?

12:32.752 --> 12:35.444
I need a caddie,
not a babysitter.

12:35.444 --> 12:37.066
Trust, son, trust.

12:43.176 --> 12:45.074
Come on, where is he?

12:45.074 --> 12:47.283
You know there are ways
to speed this up--

12:47.283 --> 12:49.838
dupe the judge
into springing Maguire.

12:50.873 --> 12:52.461
It'’s a simple
surveillance op.

12:52.461 --> 12:54.325
No need to break out
the fake mustaches.

12:54.325 --> 12:56.430
God forbid we break the law
while aiding a prison break.

12:56.430 --> 12:58.950
Okay, this isn'’t
a prison break.

12:58.950 --> 13:00.538
Is this
how CIA doublespeak works?

13:00.538 --> 13:02.264
This isn'’t a crime.
It'’s an op.

13:02.264 --> 13:03.817
You'’re not a liar.
You'’re an operative.

13:03.817 --> 13:06.164
And Charlie'’s not your ex.
He'’s an asset.

13:06.164 --> 13:07.787
Charlie <i>is</i> my asset--

13:07.787 --> 13:10.237
<i>an</i> asset for the CIA.

13:11.825 --> 13:14.000
Uh-huh.

13:23.941 --> 13:25.390
You know...

13:25.390 --> 13:28.393
I-I swear I know you
from somewhere.

13:28.393 --> 13:31.120
Ha.
Yeah, I got one of those faces.

13:31.120 --> 13:32.639
So what line of work you in?

13:32.639 --> 13:34.123
- Uh, finance.
- Mm.

13:34.123 --> 13:35.642
Before that, I used to work
for U.S. Steel.

13:35.642 --> 13:38.196
But I got out of there
in the nick of time, boy--

13:38.196 --> 13:40.233
right before the unions
drove that whole industry

13:40.233 --> 13:41.544
into the ground.

13:41.544 --> 13:43.408
Bunch of commie freeloaders, right?

13:43.408 --> 13:46.860
Yeah, they'’d rather make
a point than make a living.

13:46.860 --> 13:48.241
See?
Guys like your caddie--

13:48.241 --> 13:50.139
they understand
the value of honest work.

13:50.139 --> 13:52.555
The value of money
is in how you make it.

13:52.555 --> 13:57.146
Speaking of, want to make this
a little more interesting?

13:57.146 --> 13:58.458
Little wager?

13:59.562 --> 14:01.495
What you thinking?

14:01.495 --> 14:03.049
Five grand a hole.

14:03.049 --> 14:04.844
Why don'’t we make it ten?

14:04.844 --> 14:06.155
Oh, I like ten.

14:10.228 --> 14:12.437
Do you have any idea
how paranoid you sound?

14:12.437 --> 14:14.163
I think
I'’m smart enough to know

14:14.163 --> 14:16.683
if my girlfriend was duping me.

14:16.683 --> 14:19.272
And I'’m not going to let myself
turn into one
of those politicians

14:19.272 --> 14:20.860
who can'’t keep it
in their pants.

14:20.860 --> 14:22.171
That'’s not who I am.

14:27.004 --> 14:29.454
Then you'’re
a better man than I.

14:29.454 --> 14:32.630
There'’s a reason
that we don'’t trust Claire Fox.

14:36.703 --> 14:37.946
Wait, you and she...

14:42.916 --> 14:44.297
And you knew about all this?

14:44.297 --> 14:46.540
We put it behind us
years ago.

14:46.540 --> 14:49.716
But now Claire'’s reaching out
to you and asking for favors--

14:49.716 --> 14:52.201
And what, you think
this is Claire'’s revenge?

14:52.201 --> 14:54.928
That Jen'’s got
some ulterior motives?

14:54.928 --> 14:57.103
It wouldn'’t be
the first time.

14:58.138 --> 14:59.899
Why didn'’t you tell me, Dad?

14:59.899 --> 15:03.040
Because I never expected you
to make a deal with Claire Fox!

15:05.905 --> 15:08.286
I needed the support.

15:08.286 --> 15:09.805
And I didn'’t want to tell you

15:09.805 --> 15:12.566
because I was trying
to live up to your legacy.

15:14.568 --> 15:17.744
But for the first time,
Dad, I'’m glad I'm not you.

15:25.269 --> 15:27.098
That'’s five holes
in a row for me.

15:27.098 --> 15:29.480
Come on, give me
a fighting chance.

15:29.480 --> 15:31.516
Double or nothing on this hole.

15:33.829 --> 15:35.072
You'’re on.

15:42.355 --> 15:44.253
Ugh.

15:44.253 --> 15:46.773
Oh, that'’s right
in the cat box.

15:50.880 --> 15:53.987
You planning on turning this
around anytime soon, Pop?

15:53.987 --> 15:55.368
I'’m getting there.

15:55.368 --> 15:57.094
You'’d have an easier time
convincing me

15:57.094 --> 15:59.889
if you win at least one
of these holes.

15:59.889 --> 16:02.306
Sand wedge, please.

16:03.031 --> 16:04.998
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

16:19.081 --> 16:22.119
Thank you, Mary, Mother of God.

16:22.119 --> 16:24.673
100K on the line.
No pressure.

16:37.755 --> 16:39.170
Yes!

16:43.071 --> 16:46.143
Calm down, fella.
I still have to putt.

16:46.143 --> 16:47.661
A tie'’s not going to help you.

16:47.661 --> 16:50.043
Oh, that one, though,
call it a Joe Pesci--

16:50.043 --> 16:51.665
five foot and tough as hell.

16:57.499 --> 16:58.500
Damn it.

16:58.500 --> 17:00.847
Well, I guess we
call that a wash.

17:03.022 --> 17:05.058
Sorry.
I got to take this.

17:05.058 --> 17:06.784
William, is everything okay?

17:08.441 --> 17:10.926
Hey, you'’re walking away
with your shirt on your back.

17:10.926 --> 17:13.549
- I call that a win.
- Oh, this ain'’t over.

17:15.827 --> 17:18.209
Hey, do you remember what you
said to me when I was a kid,

17:18.209 --> 17:20.867
we'’d run grifts
at the horse track?

17:20.867 --> 17:22.903
You said the second
you get emotional,

17:22.903 --> 17:24.422
it is time to walk away.

17:24.422 --> 17:25.768
I'’ll decide when I walk away.

17:25.768 --> 17:27.425
You weren'’t even
supposed to be here.

17:27.425 --> 17:28.806
No, I wasn'’t supposed
to be here.

17:28.806 --> 17:30.877
I'’m skipping out
on the federal government

17:30.877 --> 17:32.189
to be here with you.

17:32.189 --> 17:33.362
What does that
have to do with this?

17:33.362 --> 17:34.812
Oh, Emma finds out

17:34.812 --> 17:36.538
that you and I are running
a con on the side?

17:36.538 --> 17:37.987
Oh, Emma?

17:37.987 --> 17:39.644
That'’s why they call it
an allowance, William.

17:39.644 --> 17:42.613
You will get as much
as I allow you to have.

17:45.098 --> 17:47.307
Kids?

17:47.307 --> 17:48.895
Either I give them
their inheritance now,

17:48.895 --> 17:50.483
and they blow through it
by the time they'’re 30,

17:50.483 --> 17:51.932
or we wait until I die,

17:51.932 --> 17:53.900
and we put it in the pocket
of the taxman.

17:53.900 --> 17:55.557
- Can'’t win, my friend.
- I'’ll tell you one thing--

17:55.557 --> 17:57.386
I'’m going to have them bury me
with this watch.

17:57.386 --> 17:59.285
Got to hold on
to something, right?

17:59.285 --> 18:02.322
Or you could leave him
with a little less.

18:03.806 --> 18:04.945
How about one bet?

18:04.945 --> 18:06.430
One more shot.

18:08.432 --> 18:09.985
Guy makes one lucky putt,

18:09.985 --> 18:12.643
and he thinks
he'’s Jack frickin' Nicklaus.

18:13.713 --> 18:15.922
100K says
you can'’t hit that again.

18:15.922 --> 18:18.131
200K says I will.

18:21.617 --> 18:23.102
You'’re on.

18:30.109 --> 18:31.800
So what do we do if you miss?

18:33.319 --> 18:34.768
We run.

18:53.373 --> 18:54.995
<i>Can you believe that?</i>

18:54.995 --> 18:58.171
Guy wrote a check for 200 grand
like it was nothing.

18:58.171 --> 19:00.449
Ah, you got lucky, Pop.

19:00.449 --> 19:03.832
Hey, no more going rogue
like that, okay?

19:03.832 --> 19:06.283
You'’re the one who made
a deal with the Feds,

19:06.283 --> 19:08.319
offered the family up.

19:08.319 --> 19:11.184
That'’s a real convenient
point of view.

19:11.184 --> 19:13.186
You got something
to say, son?

19:16.741 --> 19:19.468
You know,
I didn'’t choose this life.

19:19.468 --> 19:20.573
You raised me in it.

19:20.573 --> 19:22.230
I taught you how to survive.

19:22.230 --> 19:25.302
You taught me not to trust
anyone outside of the family,

19:25.302 --> 19:28.995
that anything that I wanted
for myself was a liability.

19:28.995 --> 19:30.479
People like us,

19:30.479 --> 19:32.654
we don'’t get the choices
that these guys do.

19:32.654 --> 19:34.207
I did the best I could.

19:34.207 --> 19:35.933
And I'’m doing my best
to keep us out of trouble.

19:35.933 --> 19:37.935
But you making moves
like this, you just--

19:37.935 --> 19:41.180
you'’re--you're pulling us
right back into it.

19:41.180 --> 19:43.182
Come on, you got to think.

19:44.355 --> 19:46.323
I'’ll see you back at the bar.

19:55.539 --> 19:57.196
Can I get you something else?

19:57.196 --> 20:00.095
A little honesty
would be nice.

20:00.095 --> 20:01.614
I'’ll take another beer.

20:04.858 --> 20:08.586
- Pulling a job behind my back?
- Won'’t happen again.

20:08.586 --> 20:11.348
And skipping your
neurologist appointment, babe?

20:13.522 --> 20:16.767
I didn'’t skip it.
It was last week.

20:16.767 --> 20:19.701
What?
Why didn'’t you tell me?

20:19.701 --> 20:21.427
Because the news
wasn'’t so good.

20:21.427 --> 20:25.983
Doc said my MMSE score
was down from last time.

20:27.398 --> 20:29.055
That'’s why I went
after my money.

20:29.055 --> 20:32.265
After seeing
the way Maurice went...

20:33.818 --> 20:36.476
I don'’t want to leave
my family empty-handed.

20:37.581 --> 20:40.963
We don'’t need money, Leo.
We just need you.

20:40.963 --> 20:42.068
Okay?

20:45.382 --> 20:46.900
Okay.

20:46.900 --> 20:48.557
- Okay.
- Okay.

20:48.557 --> 20:50.973
- Give him his beer.
- Well, I'’m trying.

20:53.976 --> 20:55.564
- Hey.
- Hey.

20:55.564 --> 20:57.256
I was looking
for your sister.

20:57.256 --> 20:59.534
Yeah, she'’s inside.

21:00.604 --> 21:02.502
Missed you today.
Everything okay?

21:02.502 --> 21:04.401
I heard you were tied up
with your dad.

21:04.401 --> 21:07.093
You asking as my handler
or my ex?

21:07.093 --> 21:08.439
Charlie...

21:09.716 --> 21:11.580
I'’m just asking
as someone who cares.

21:11.580 --> 21:13.789
Okay, fine.
You really want to know?

21:13.789 --> 21:16.413
I caught my dad
trying to settle an old score

21:16.413 --> 21:18.587
with a guy who bankrupted
his pension.

21:18.587 --> 21:20.762
Wait.
He was running a con?

21:20.762 --> 21:22.798
And this is why
I can'’t talk to you.

21:22.798 --> 21:24.766
Charlie, I can'’t protect
you and your family

21:24.766 --> 21:26.492
from random crimes--
that wasn'’t our deal.

21:26.492 --> 21:29.011
Keep your voice down.

21:29.011 --> 21:32.118
You don'’t like the answers,
stop asking the questions.

21:32.118 --> 21:33.464
- Okay?
- Charlie.

21:42.956 --> 21:45.131
Was that my brother?

21:45.131 --> 21:46.374
Yeah.

21:48.030 --> 21:49.791
Want a drink?

21:49.791 --> 21:51.448
Yeah.

21:53.795 --> 21:56.867
- Wine okay?
- Sure, thanks.

22:06.911 --> 22:10.674
I think it'’s time we move past
simple surveillance.

22:10.674 --> 22:12.331
What'’s that?

22:12.331 --> 22:15.506
The judge'’s tax returns
and bank accounts.

22:17.370 --> 22:20.166
Uh, nice.

22:20.166 --> 22:21.581
Yeah.

22:21.581 --> 22:24.239
Correlate any
suspicious influxes of cash

22:24.239 --> 22:25.827
with cases he'’s dismissed.

22:25.827 --> 22:27.518
Or made
questionable judgments on.

22:27.518 --> 22:29.382
Let'’s find out
what kind of cases

22:29.382 --> 22:32.523
move him to compromise
his principles.

22:32.523 --> 22:34.663
Nice work, Logistics.

22:34.663 --> 22:37.045
At least one Nicoletti
trusts me.

22:39.392 --> 22:41.946
You know
you'’ve got that wrong.

22:41.946 --> 22:43.120
What do you mean?

22:44.915 --> 22:48.643
When Charlie decided
to tell you the truth about...

22:49.885 --> 22:52.612
being a con man and Daphne
coming after your family,

22:52.612 --> 22:55.546
he put us at risk for you.

22:55.546 --> 22:59.378
And I-I get that you feel
like he betrayed you

22:59.378 --> 23:00.862
and he lied to you,

23:00.862 --> 23:03.416
but Charlie'’s never been
that honest with anybody.

23:03.416 --> 23:05.418
So, from my perspective,

23:05.418 --> 23:09.111
he sacrificed himself for you.

23:24.057 --> 23:26.750
Hey.

23:26.750 --> 23:30.478
Look, uh, I know things got
a little tense out there

23:30.478 --> 23:32.134
between me and you
on the golf course.

23:32.134 --> 23:34.343
Come on, we--we don'’t need
to get into it.

23:34.343 --> 23:36.449
Please.

23:36.449 --> 23:38.106
That thing you said about...

23:39.452 --> 23:41.420
you not having a choice...

23:42.490 --> 23:44.077
you'’re not wrong.

23:44.077 --> 23:47.633
All I'’ve ever done is to try
to do right by you,

23:47.633 --> 23:50.083
your sister, and your ma,

23:50.083 --> 23:51.844
but I also get
that I can be a--

23:51.844 --> 23:53.742
Stubborn pain in the ass.

23:56.607 --> 24:00.128
I was going to say
uncompromising, but...

24:01.509 --> 24:02.682
sure.

24:05.444 --> 24:08.792
I let you believe that
it was us against the world...

24:10.172 --> 24:11.622
because...

24:15.384 --> 24:17.456
Because at least
we'’d always have each other.

24:17.456 --> 24:20.113
Hey, you were right.
We do.

24:20.113 --> 24:22.391
Except that you need
more than just us, Charlie.

24:22.391 --> 24:25.153
I mean, I want you to make your
own choices, be your own man.

24:25.153 --> 24:27.051
I never meant
for you to be an island.

24:27.051 --> 24:28.570
I know that.

24:30.054 --> 24:31.470
I know it.

24:33.782 --> 24:35.991
Hey, look who came
to visit us.

24:35.991 --> 24:38.477
I'’m so sorry, Shelby.
So sorry.

24:38.477 --> 24:39.685
Thanks.

24:39.685 --> 24:42.342
Your father--
he was a good man.

24:42.342 --> 24:43.482
How'’s your mom?

24:43.482 --> 24:45.035
Oh, you know.

24:45.035 --> 24:47.416
She'’s pouring herself
into planning the funeral.

24:47.416 --> 24:48.797
Okay.

24:48.797 --> 24:50.212
Well, hey, you need
anything from us, just--

24:50.212 --> 24:52.698
Thanks, but, uh,
I could use a drink, though.

24:52.698 --> 24:54.009
Yeah, sit down.

25:04.433 --> 25:06.746
Doesn'’t feel right.

25:06.746 --> 25:09.508
I got mine, but what
about everybody else?

25:09.508 --> 25:13.581
Hey, it'’s not your fault
everyone'’s pensions went bust.

25:15.824 --> 25:17.343
Still, I can'’t shake

25:17.343 --> 25:19.103
the feeling that we left money
on the table.

25:19.103 --> 25:20.657
Oh, yeah.

25:20.657 --> 25:23.349
That guy definitely seemed like
he had some money to spare.

25:26.179 --> 25:28.561
- What about Emma?
- What about Daphne?

25:28.561 --> 25:32.289
What about us?

25:32.289 --> 25:33.670
It would take a big job

25:33.670 --> 25:35.844
to reel him in
for some serious money.

25:35.844 --> 25:38.675
So let'’s convince him
that by spending money,

25:38.675 --> 25:40.021
he'’s actually saving it.

25:40.021 --> 25:41.954
Guys like that--
they love a tax loophole.

25:41.954 --> 25:44.025
- You mean like a charity con.
- Mm-hmm.

25:44.025 --> 25:47.028
But how do we get him
to part with that much money?

25:47.028 --> 25:50.100
Hey, hey.
Too early for a pint?

25:50.100 --> 25:51.964
Not at all.

25:51.964 --> 25:54.691
We get him to buy a building.

25:54.691 --> 25:57.452
And we'’ve got the gang
to work on it.

25:57.452 --> 25:59.109
Hey, Pike.

25:59.109 --> 26:01.836
I think we'’re going to need you
to stay sober today.

26:02.768 --> 26:05.391
Can I have just o-one sip?

26:05.391 --> 26:06.875
Shelby?
- Yeah.

26:06.875 --> 26:08.877
You might want in
on this, too.

26:08.877 --> 26:10.569
Pike.
- What'’s happening?

26:10.569 --> 26:12.916
Can you gather all the boys
from the old local?

26:12.916 --> 26:16.575
- You got a job for us?
- Yeah, a union job.

26:20.613 --> 26:22.304
So, after a thrilling night

26:22.304 --> 26:25.342
of analyzing Judge Bishop'’s
tax returns, I did find this.

26:25.342 --> 26:27.068
He has a numbered account.

26:27.068 --> 26:30.796
The deposits line up
with very specific rulings.

26:30.796 --> 26:33.902
Clear House Insurance
vs. East Limited,

26:33.902 --> 26:35.973
Reed vs. Virco Motors.

26:35.973 --> 26:38.148
- These are all corporate cases.
- Exactly.

26:38.148 --> 26:42.428
The judge only takes bribes
from "respectable" criminals.

26:42.428 --> 26:46.605
I guess crime is always
a game of self-rationalization.

26:46.605 --> 26:48.848
So is working with criminals.

26:51.264 --> 26:53.612
Want to hear my plan?

26:53.612 --> 26:54.958
Please.

26:54.958 --> 26:57.616
We pretend to be a player
in a pending case.

26:57.616 --> 26:58.789
- Mm-hmm.
- We lean on the judge

26:58.789 --> 27:00.032
into taking a bribe,

27:00.032 --> 27:01.654
and then we catch
him in the act.

27:01.654 --> 27:03.829
- Do you have a case in mind?
- I do.

27:05.140 --> 27:08.557
Novenza Electronics Corporation.

27:08.557 --> 27:10.111
The judge is set to rule

27:10.111 --> 27:12.044
against the chairman'’s
daughter, Deborah Nam.

27:12.044 --> 27:13.942
"Nahm"--it'’s Korean.

27:16.462 --> 27:17.774
What, you'’re not thinking--

27:20.224 --> 27:22.951
<i>♪ It'’s time
to pay attention ♪</i>

27:22.951 --> 27:25.160
<i>♪ Y'’all listen up ♪</i>

27:25.160 --> 27:27.473
<i>♪ All eyes
in my direction... ♪</i>

27:27.473 --> 27:29.509
<i>So there are basics
to any con.</i>

27:29.509 --> 27:30.856
Let them lead the discussion.

27:30.856 --> 27:32.961
When in doubt,
put a clock on it.

27:32.961 --> 27:35.481
- And the best lies--
- Come from the truth.

27:35.481 --> 27:37.483
Same techniques
they teach at Langley.

27:37.483 --> 27:39.658
<i>At Langley, right,
because in your line of work,</i>

27:39.658 --> 27:41.660
<i>it'’s important to gain
people'’s confidence.</i>

27:41.660 --> 27:43.316
Exactly.

27:43.316 --> 27:45.525
Some might even say
that there'’s an artistry to it.

27:45.525 --> 27:46.906
I see what you'’re doing,

27:46.906 --> 27:48.977
and it'’s not at all
the same thing.

27:48.977 --> 27:50.979
If you say so, Logistics.

27:54.327 --> 27:56.709
Ready to be
a power-hungry heiress

27:56.709 --> 27:58.504
with a knack for blackmail?

28:00.092 --> 28:03.509
You know, I'’ve been studying
just the right person.

28:03.509 --> 28:07.616
<i>♪ Watch me flex,
flex, flex ♪</i>

28:07.616 --> 28:09.204
<i>♪ Watch me...</i>

28:09.204 --> 28:11.068
<i>So, remember, the judge
is set to pass a merger</i>

28:11.068 --> 28:13.208
<i>that will keep
Novenza'’s chairman in power.</i>

28:13.208 --> 28:15.590
Deborah wants to block
that merger,

28:15.590 --> 28:17.350
take the power for herself.

28:17.350 --> 28:20.906
<i>So, once the judge accepts
a bribe from Deborah Nam,</i>

28:20.906 --> 28:22.390
Daphne is free to go in,

28:22.390 --> 28:24.944
blackmail him into releasing
Patrick Maguire.

28:31.261 --> 28:34.298
- Can I help you?
- Let'’s find out.

28:36.404 --> 28:38.717
Deborah Nam--
you should recognize the name.

28:38.717 --> 28:40.373
Yeah, from the Novenza case.

28:44.274 --> 28:46.483
The merger--you'’re
going to rule against it,

28:46.483 --> 28:50.245
and I promise
I'’ll make it worth your while.

28:50.245 --> 28:52.489
Okay, now turn the card over.

28:52.489 --> 28:54.491
Good part'’s on the back.

28:54.491 --> 28:57.874
Offshore account,
money'’s all yours...

28:57.874 --> 28:59.427
pending your approval.

29:00.808 --> 29:02.292
A little discretion.

29:04.328 --> 29:05.605
Relax.

29:05.605 --> 29:08.919
I'’m just a businesswoman
offering a business deal.

29:08.919 --> 29:10.749
You'’d simply be offering
a judgment

29:10.749 --> 29:13.890
that would please
our board, shareholders,

29:13.890 --> 29:15.408
and me.

29:15.408 --> 29:17.652
Uh, give me time
to review the case, and I'’ll--

29:36.878 --> 29:38.190
Look, I need to go.

29:38.190 --> 29:40.433
So, if you'’re not in...

29:40.433 --> 29:42.125
Well, actually...

29:43.402 --> 29:45.956
I believe we'’ve come to see
eye to eye on this matter.

29:49.166 --> 29:51.479
I knew you'’d get there.

30:01.006 --> 30:03.008
Okay, so we got nine holes

30:03.008 --> 30:05.355
to make this site our own
before they show up.

30:05.355 --> 30:07.115
All right,
the way Pop plays golf,

30:07.115 --> 30:08.876
we'’re going to have about
four hours to move in

30:08.876 --> 30:11.464
and make it look like
we'’ve been here for months.

30:13.190 --> 30:15.814
Hey, thought
I'’d find you here.

30:15.814 --> 30:17.850
You here to gloat or to golf?

30:17.850 --> 30:20.508
Nah, I'’m here to make amends.

30:23.304 --> 30:25.478
This?

30:25.478 --> 30:29.689
Ah, hell, I don'’t need your
money any more than you do.

30:29.689 --> 30:31.484
But...

30:31.484 --> 30:33.866
I know a way that you can use
it to really make a difference.

30:33.866 --> 30:35.868
Yeah?
What'’s that?

30:35.868 --> 30:37.421
It'’s called the Thelman Fund.

30:37.421 --> 30:40.769
It'’s a little fundraising
campaign that I chair.

30:40.769 --> 30:43.255
We'’re building a wing
at River Hospital,

30:43.255 --> 30:45.533
and we sure could use
the donation.

30:45.533 --> 30:49.226
Not only is it a way to take
a charitable contribution,

30:49.226 --> 30:50.779
but...

30:50.779 --> 30:53.161
you know, it'’s a way of leaving
something behind

30:53.161 --> 30:56.061
for people to remember you by, forever.

30:56.061 --> 30:57.683
- Amen to that.
- Yeah.

30:57.683 --> 30:59.858
Still, if I'’m going to put
my money into something,

30:59.858 --> 31:02.032
I kind of like to see it.

31:02.032 --> 31:03.275
It'’s a hospital, you say?

31:03.275 --> 31:05.001
Oh, yeah,
and a very special one.

31:05.001 --> 31:07.900
I'’m going to swing by there
today when I finish up here.

31:07.900 --> 31:09.729
Come by if you want.

31:09.729 --> 31:13.216
Why don'’t we golf later?
I'’ll follow you.

31:13.216 --> 31:15.287
- Right now?
- Yeah.

31:17.047 --> 31:19.601
- Yeah, let'’s do it.
- Let'’s do it.

31:19.601 --> 31:20.740
All right.

31:24.054 --> 31:25.538
Ah, hold on a second.

31:25.538 --> 31:28.369
Uh, scratch four hours.
We got an hour.

31:28.369 --> 31:30.647
Last-minute demands,
tight deadlines--

31:30.647 --> 31:32.062
like old times.

31:32.062 --> 31:33.443
The man knows what
he'’s talking about.

31:33.443 --> 31:35.100
- Yeah, right.
- Come on, now.

31:35.100 --> 31:37.171
- Here we go.
- Let'’s get this happening.

31:40.933 --> 31:42.728
<i>Okay, Shelb,
Mom'’s going to need</i>

31:42.728 --> 31:44.557
about a half hour in there--
you got this?

31:44.557 --> 31:47.906
Hey, I'’m pretty good
at keeping guys distracted.

31:48.941 --> 31:50.391
Hello.

31:54.153 --> 31:56.466
Ah, uh, who are you?

31:56.466 --> 31:59.745
Renee, hospital controller.
They sent me over for the tour.

31:59.745 --> 32:03.093
Don'’t have anything
on the schedule about a tour.

32:03.093 --> 32:04.681
Let me give them a call.

32:04.681 --> 32:07.615
My first day
out of my cubicle in a year,

32:07.615 --> 32:09.479
and you'’re going to send me
back already?

32:09.479 --> 32:11.688
I was hoping to see something
more than spreadsheets

32:11.688 --> 32:13.138
for, what, a few minutes?

32:13.138 --> 32:15.347
<i>♪ Pour some water
on the fire ♪</i>

32:15.347 --> 32:17.452
<i>♪ Light another, ready to go</i>

32:17.452 --> 32:18.626
Okay.

32:20.007 --> 32:22.285
- This way.
- Thank you.

32:22.285 --> 32:24.839
- So, uh, you'’re a controller.
- Mm-hmm.

32:24.839 --> 32:29.257
That'’s like an accountant. Exactly.

32:29.257 --> 32:31.363
All clear.
I'’m in.

32:31.363 --> 32:34.366
Good, because here they come.

32:34.366 --> 32:37.334
Well, would you look at that.
That'’s going up quick.

32:37.334 --> 32:39.164
Sorry, fellas.
This is a closed site.

32:39.164 --> 32:41.545
- Hey, Carson Stiles.
- Ah, Mr. Stiles.

32:41.545 --> 32:43.444
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, go ahead.
- Thank you.

32:43.444 --> 32:44.790
- Thank you.
- All right.

32:47.379 --> 32:49.968
Let'’s let
the foreman show you

32:49.968 --> 32:52.349
what the future looks like.

32:52.349 --> 32:54.800
Yeah, so, when we'’re done,

32:54.800 --> 32:58.562
this will be eight stories,
labs, offices, clinics--

32:58.562 --> 32:59.978
whole nine yards.

32:59.978 --> 33:02.118
It might just look like
a bunch of beams and bullets

33:02.118 --> 33:04.568
- right now, but--
-"Bullets"?

33:04.568 --> 33:06.639
- Screws, I mean.
- No, I know.

33:06.639 --> 33:09.056
I just haven'’t heard that
since my steel-mill days.

33:11.472 --> 33:13.922
Oh, and I forgot
the best part--

33:13.922 --> 33:15.683
your name right up there.

33:15.683 --> 33:17.996
No, no, that'’s
the wrong investor.

33:17.996 --> 33:19.411
Oh.

33:19.411 --> 33:20.860
The angel investor
I was telling you about

33:20.860 --> 33:22.655
is going to swing by
later this afternoon.

33:22.655 --> 33:24.416
- Right. Oh, yeah.
- Angel investor?

33:24.416 --> 33:27.833
Yeah, we'’re still looking
for a capstone investor.

33:27.833 --> 33:30.525
So, if you happen to have
an extra 10 mil lying around,

33:30.525 --> 33:33.494
it could be your name
right on this building.

33:33.494 --> 33:34.943
Just right above there.

33:34.943 --> 33:37.325
Actually, you could see
it from the highway.

33:37.325 --> 33:39.879
Well, that'’d be a hell
of a tax write-off.

33:39.879 --> 33:41.329
Yes, it would.

33:41.329 --> 33:43.883
Well, I got to talk to my
business guys about this.

33:43.883 --> 33:45.506
- Thank you for the tour.
- Sure.

33:45.506 --> 33:48.060
- I'’ll walk you out.
- My pleasure.

33:48.060 --> 33:50.683
Really,
thanks for coming down.

33:50.683 --> 33:52.168
Here'’s my card.

33:52.168 --> 33:56.206
As soon as your people give
the go-ahead, call me directly.

33:56.206 --> 33:58.070
Well, I hope to.

33:58.070 --> 34:00.866
But you don'’t get to where I am
by being reckless with money.

34:00.866 --> 34:02.626
You know what I'’m saying?

34:02.626 --> 34:04.076
Listen...

34:04.076 --> 34:07.183
hopefully
I'’ll be seeing you soon.

34:07.183 --> 34:08.770
Take care.

34:14.707 --> 34:16.813
Nice meeting you, Davey.

34:23.889 --> 34:26.374
Ah... you got me.

34:26.374 --> 34:28.411
It'’s nice to have a moment

34:28.411 --> 34:30.723
that'’s not also
a photo op, huh?

34:30.723 --> 34:31.828
Yeah.

34:31.828 --> 34:33.795
Thank God Claire Fox
introduced us.

34:35.003 --> 34:37.592
Hey, how did your family
get to know Claire, anyhow?

34:37.592 --> 34:39.215
Who knows?

34:39.215 --> 34:41.389
They'’re always introducing me
to someone who knows someone.

34:41.389 --> 34:43.322
Yeah, well, they must have
had real connections

34:43.322 --> 34:45.359
to have pull
with someone like her.

34:46.946 --> 34:50.088
David,
what are you really asking?

34:52.331 --> 34:53.712
My family...

34:55.162 --> 34:57.095
my father...

34:57.095 --> 34:59.476
has some history
with Claire Fox.

34:59.476 --> 35:01.789
They don'’t trust her, and...

35:04.171 --> 35:06.725
I guess I need to
know that I can trust you.

35:08.278 --> 35:11.247
David, you know me.

35:11.247 --> 35:12.869
I do.

35:13.870 --> 35:16.942
Claire'’s history
with my family...

35:16.942 --> 35:19.979
it complicates your involvement
in my campaign.

35:27.055 --> 35:30.024
Not if I'’m not on it.

35:30.024 --> 35:31.198
No, Jen, I--

35:31.198 --> 35:33.441
I really like you.

35:39.827 --> 35:41.691
Are you sure about this?

35:43.969 --> 35:45.281
Positive.

35:45.281 --> 35:48.491
I can get a job
at another campaign.

35:50.389 --> 35:52.219
But I can'’t find another you.

36:01.504 --> 36:03.678
Productive day at work?

36:04.610 --> 36:07.165
I thought
I'’d made myself clear.

36:07.165 --> 36:08.373
I want nothing to do with you.

36:08.373 --> 36:11.169
Ooh, too late for that.

36:11.169 --> 36:13.378
What are you talking about?

36:14.102 --> 36:16.208
Your new bank account.

36:16.208 --> 36:18.486
See, it was the same one
I offered.

36:18.486 --> 36:20.039
It'’s up to you, Your Honor.

36:20.039 --> 36:24.941
Would you prefer to be bribed
or blackmailed?

36:24.941 --> 36:29.739
You will rule in favor
of Patrick Maguire.

36:38.196 --> 36:40.059
These things happen.

36:40.059 --> 36:41.440
But you tell the boys, Franny,

36:41.440 --> 36:43.718
that we still got him
on the hook, okay?

36:43.718 --> 36:45.513
All right, baby.

36:45.513 --> 36:47.205
I'’ll see you back at the bar.

36:47.205 --> 36:51.864
Hey, hey, don'’t you worry.
Today was not a total bust.

36:51.864 --> 36:54.212
Got to go, hon.

36:56.214 --> 36:57.353
Leonard Nicoletti?

36:59.803 --> 37:01.288
Who'’s asking?

37:01.288 --> 37:04.049
We want to ask you a couple
questions down at the station.

37:04.049 --> 37:05.464
About what?

37:05.464 --> 37:07.984
Your whereabouts
this afternoon, sir.

37:08.847 --> 37:10.883
You want to get
in the car, please?

37:17.959 --> 37:19.064
Sure.

37:41.569 --> 37:44.296
Patrick Maguire-- free man.

37:44.296 --> 37:47.023
Now we just have
to put him away for good.

37:47.023 --> 37:48.818
That'’s still the plan?

37:48.818 --> 37:51.579
Take down his family,
save mine?

37:51.579 --> 37:54.133
That'’s the plan.

37:54.133 --> 37:56.412
See, stopping bad guys
isn'’t so bad.

37:56.412 --> 37:58.103
And for what it'’s worth,

37:58.103 --> 38:00.347
you'’d make a good officer.

38:00.347 --> 38:02.832
Hold on, hold on.

38:04.489 --> 38:06.801
Hey, Charlie.
<i>I need you home.</i>

38:06.801 --> 38:08.838
- What?
<i>- The cops just picked Dad up.</i>

38:08.838 --> 38:10.495
<i>They'’re bringing him into
the station for questioning.</i>

38:10.495 --> 38:11.979
What do you mean
brought him in for questioning?

38:11.979 --> 38:14.119
<i>I don'’t know.
I-I'’m not sure.</i>

38:14.119 --> 38:16.155
<i>I don'’t have the answer, but
Mom is freaking out right now.</i>

38:16.155 --> 38:17.640
- Okay. I'’m--I'm coming.
<i>- Yeah, just get out of there.</i>

38:17.640 --> 38:19.193
<i>Okay.</i>

38:19.193 --> 38:22.058
- What is it? What'’s wrong?
- Cops took my dad.

38:37.453 --> 38:39.489
Connor, my boy.

38:40.179 --> 38:41.629
Hey.

38:41.629 --> 38:44.218
So what'’s it going to be?

38:44.218 --> 38:46.462
I got Nicky holding
your booth in the back,

38:46.462 --> 38:47.808
if it'’s a meal you're after

38:47.808 --> 38:49.637
or a bottle of whiskey
at the warehouse,

38:49.637 --> 38:52.571
if want to get right
to seeing my work.

38:52.571 --> 38:55.574
Are you also planning on
taking credit for my release?

38:56.920 --> 39:01.649
Well, you know, if a man
finds out he'’s got a sister...

39:01.649 --> 39:03.858
that can make him paranoid,
you know.

39:06.067 --> 39:08.380
Look, I don'’t know how I'm
supposed to run this company

39:08.380 --> 39:11.210
if you'’re keeping things
from me.

39:14.386 --> 39:16.664
She'’s no Maguire.

39:16.664 --> 39:19.874
And she'’s only here
as long as I choose.

39:22.670 --> 39:25.121
They said they'’re holding him
on grand larceny.

39:25.121 --> 39:27.019
That'’s--that's all
they tell me.

39:27.019 --> 39:28.400
I don'’t get it.

39:28.400 --> 39:30.091
Is it the Alzheimer'’s?
Why would he lift something?

39:30.091 --> 39:32.197
No, no. Ma, no, no, no,
it'’s not that.

39:32.197 --> 39:34.061
It'’s Slocum's watch, all right?
He wouldn'’t let it go.

39:34.061 --> 39:36.028
- Are you kidding me?
- Oh, my God.

39:36.028 --> 39:38.514
After all of this, he'’s going
to get put away for a watch?

39:38.514 --> 39:40.688
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
Oh, and then they'’re going to
find out about the charity con.

39:40.688 --> 39:42.103
Ma, Ma, Ma, slow down.

39:42.103 --> 39:43.691
And it'’s only
a matter of time before--

39:43.691 --> 39:45.555
- Slow down, please.
- We'’re screwed.

39:45.555 --> 39:47.281
We'’re going to figure it out.
We'’re going to figure it out.

39:47.281 --> 39:48.627
- We'’re going to figure--
- You'’re here.

39:48.627 --> 39:49.525
Pop?
- Oh, my God.

39:49.525 --> 39:50.905
How are you here?

39:50.905 --> 39:53.529
I had someone
looking out for me.

40:05.437 --> 40:07.543
You broke your code.

40:07.543 --> 40:09.234
I did what'’s right.

40:20.970 --> 40:22.799
Hey, uh...

40:23.766 --> 40:25.837
how did you do that?

40:27.597 --> 40:30.324
I told them your dad'’s
a vital CIA asset

40:30.324 --> 40:34.259
who committed this crime in
support of a confidential op.

40:34.259 --> 40:35.640
Wow.

40:35.640 --> 40:38.953
Well, that'’s, uh,
not exactly the truth.

40:40.265 --> 40:43.579
I guess I pulled off
two cons today.

40:43.579 --> 40:45.477
Your dad'’s a good man.

40:47.962 --> 40:49.481
Thank you.

40:49.481 --> 40:51.725
Um, it means a lot.

40:52.795 --> 40:54.659
I owed you one.

40:54.659 --> 40:57.109
You did the same thing
for my family.

41:03.046 --> 41:04.185
See you.

41:16.543 --> 41:18.648
You'’re here.

41:18.648 --> 41:20.478
With you to thank.

41:28.693 --> 41:31.627
So this is what you can buy

41:31.627 --> 41:34.250
when you'’re sponging off
the Maguires, huh?

41:34.250 --> 41:35.803
What is he doing here?

41:35.803 --> 41:37.805
He'’s impressed
with the work you did, Daphne.

41:37.805 --> 41:39.048
We both were.

41:39.048 --> 41:41.637
I want you
to walk me and Connor

41:41.637 --> 41:44.985
through how
this operation works.

41:44.985 --> 41:47.090
Looks like you won, sister.

41:47.090 --> 41:49.437
I mean, that'’s what
you wanted, right?

41:49.437 --> 41:50.818
Enough.

41:50.818 --> 41:53.511
It'’s a family dinner,
our first one...

41:54.442 --> 41:56.099
so sit.

42:15.049 --> 42:17.569
To the Maguires.
