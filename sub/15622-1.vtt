00:55.293 --> 00:58.729
The French tried to build a canal
here before the Americans.

00:58.896 --> 01:01.421
At the height of their
effort, 500 workers...

01:01.599 --> 01:05.160
were dying every week from
malaria and yellow fever.

01:05.703 --> 01:09.139
They couldn't come up with
cemetery space fast enough...

01:09.307 --> 01:13.403
not to mention the morale problem
all those crosses would have made.

01:13.578 --> 01:16.843
So they bought shiploads
of vinegar in Cuba...

01:17.014 --> 01:20.609
and in each barrel,
they sealed one corpse.

01:20.785 --> 01:24.687
And then they sold them as medical
cadavers all over Europe.

01:24.856 --> 01:28.587
And for a while, that was their
principal source of profit.

01:28.759 --> 01:34.220
You see, this place has always
had a special way of dealing...

01:34.398 --> 01:38.664
with both profit and death.

01:57.188 --> 02:03.093
As some of you may have heard, there
is a hurricane warning tonight.

02:03.261 --> 02:07.254
Well, Rangers do not
wait on good weather.

02:07.431 --> 02:12.164
Rangers do not wait for
a bright, sunshiny day.

02:12.336 --> 02:18.434
Oh, no. Rangers are trained to operate
in the worst possible conditions...

02:18.609 --> 02:22.909
and take said conditions and
turn them against their enemy.

02:23.080 --> 02:29.076
You each have one rifle, one sidearm
and one white phosphorus grenade.

02:29.253 --> 02:34.418
This is a live E and E, so please
keep those weapons safetied...

02:34.592 --> 02:38.460
so as not to shoot off
your nonexistent dicks.

02:40.231 --> 02:45.430
The rally point is a bunker
two clicks north of the LZ.

02:45.603 --> 02:48.197
You will split
into teams of two.

02:48.372 --> 02:52.968
Each designated area has
20 reactive targets.

02:53.144 --> 02:58.878
The first team to get all 20 and
reach the rally point wins.

02:59.283 --> 03:04.414
Anything goes pear-shaped out
there, you pop white and radio in.

03:04.588 --> 03:07.955
I will be in each area
monitoring your progress.

03:08.125 --> 03:12.186
If I see anybody drag ass...

03:12.363 --> 03:16.629
I swear to God, you
will swim the canal.

03:45.062 --> 03:48.691
- Where is the original pickup point?
- About two klicks up the valley.

03:48.866 --> 03:53.200
So this was a Ranger training team?
When were they due?

03:53.371 --> 03:55.965
They missed contact
six hours ago.

03:56.140 --> 04:00.873
Colonel Styles, that doesn't necessarily
mean anything in a storm like this.

04:01.045 --> 04:03.946
No, it wouldn't be any
wonder if they were delayed.

04:09.320 --> 04:11.550
I'm not seeing them.

04:12.089 --> 04:14.489
I'm gonna have to
come back around.

04:14.759 --> 04:18.024
Wait a minute. Wait a minute,
I'm coming around to your side.

04:18.696 --> 04:20.459
We got one... No, maybe two.

04:20.630 --> 04:23.429
Wait, I think he's carrying somebody.
Is he hurt?

04:23.601 --> 04:26.069
All right, let's get down there.

04:45.322 --> 04:47.290
What is that?

04:49.493 --> 04:50.960
Is that live fire?

04:59.937 --> 05:04.499
Christ, they're shooting at each other.
Get us on the ground. Now!

05:18.556 --> 05:22.014
I've got a bleeder down here.
A little suction down there.

05:22.560 --> 05:23.754
There it is.

05:24.428 --> 05:26.692
That's enough!

05:26.897 --> 05:32.199
You went out with your sergeant and
six men last night on an exercise.

05:32.369 --> 05:34.997
You came back a few men light.

05:35.172 --> 05:38.300
Four, to be precise.

05:40.044 --> 05:41.807
Where are they?

06:08.139 --> 06:10.607
Not in this lifetime.

06:13.811 --> 06:15.073
Captain...

06:16.080 --> 06:20.141
if you don't make progress on this, we'll
have Washington crawling all over us.

06:20.317 --> 06:22.217
What did he write?

06:26.590 --> 06:29.354
"I'll only talk to a Ranger.
Someone from off-post."

06:29.527 --> 06:31.154
Let me see it.

06:33.531 --> 06:35.499
It's a stall tactic.
Nothing more.

06:53.217 --> 06:55.208
Give him what he wants.
I know somebody.

06:55.386 --> 06:59.254
- Sir, I am confident that I can handle this.
- And I'm not.

07:12.970 --> 07:15.063
Oh, God.

07:27.318 --> 07:33.223
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,
five, four, three, two, one.

07:33.390 --> 07:36.154
- Hello.
- Tom, what's wrong with your phone?

07:36.327 --> 07:38.261
I've been trying to
reach you all day.

07:38.429 --> 07:40.863
There's a hurricane.
Everything's shut down.

07:41.031 --> 07:44.558
- Hola, Tommy!
- It's carnival, come on.

07:44.735 --> 07:47.602
- The girl's name is Gabriella!
- I want to meet all your friends!

07:47.771 --> 07:51.138
- She wants to meet you.
- Yeah, we'll samba!

07:51.308 --> 07:52.832
- Are you coming?
- I will. I will.

07:53.010 --> 07:55.672
You better. I'm gonna
come and get you.

07:55.846 --> 07:56.972
- Tom?
- What's that?

07:57.147 --> 07:59.513
- I said, are you drinking again?
- Nothing like that.

07:59.683 --> 08:02.550
Any time a cocaine dealer is
suspected of bribing an agent...

08:02.720 --> 08:05.780
we pull him off the assignment and
run a check. It's not personal.

08:05.956 --> 08:08.720
A drug lord that I helped bust
says that he paid me off...

08:08.892 --> 08:11.827
you guys believe him, and say
it's not personal? Fuck you.

08:11.996 --> 08:15.830
Relax, I'm sure you'll come up clean.
You'll be back on the job in a week.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.060
With everyone looking at me
sideways, wondering if I'm dirty.

08:19.236 --> 08:23.036
Look, I'm DEA in cocaine central.
All we have down here is trust.

08:23.207 --> 08:26.267
And after what you did, nobody's
ever gonna trust me... Hold on.

08:26.443 --> 08:27.671
Are you putting me...?

08:28.145 --> 08:31.581
Tom, Bill. I need you
to come down here.

08:31.749 --> 08:34.717
- Come down where?
- Clayton, as soon as possible.

08:34.885 --> 08:37.318
- Something happened. It's bad.
- Are you all right?

08:39.690 --> 08:41.089
No.

08:41.892 --> 08:44.087
No, I need your help.

08:48.299 --> 08:49.664
Sir?

08:49.833 --> 08:53.234
Sir, this is completely unorthodox.
This guy isn't even Army.

08:58.175 --> 09:00.234
Go ahead, sir.

09:00.511 --> 09:02.911
He was Army. I hadn't
seen him in years...

09:03.080 --> 09:07.983
until I ran into him the other night in
a parking lot. Trust me, he was Army.

09:08.152 --> 09:11.679
He trained at Benning and here with
me, so he knows the territory.

09:11.855 --> 09:15.256
Before he left the service, he was the
best interrogator I had ever seen.

09:15.426 --> 09:18.987
Tom Hardy could get in your head
faster than you could tie your shoes.

09:19.163 --> 09:22.428
- Why did he leave the Army?
- I don't know and I don't care...

09:22.599 --> 09:24.692
because there is nobody
better in a room.

09:24.868 --> 09:26.961
Sir, if he's not Army,
it's not official.

09:27.137 --> 09:29.731
Well, then, Captain
Osborne, it's unofficial.

09:29.907 --> 09:31.772
Evening, sir.

09:39.383 --> 09:42.011
It doesn't get
unofficialer than that.

09:42.186 --> 09:46.179
- Hey, Bill, how is it going?
- Pretty much fucked. You?

09:46.357 --> 09:47.619
Wet. So how's the knee?

09:47.791 --> 09:50.055
They're never gonna make
me a general anyway.

09:50.227 --> 09:52.752
Fuck them if they can't take a joke.
Why am I here?

09:52.930 --> 09:54.625
I'm curious about
that myself, sir.

09:55.065 --> 09:57.863
Sir, I am Julia Osborne. I
am the provost marshal here.

09:58.035 --> 10:01.732
- Osborne, do I look like a "sir" to you?
- Not particularly, sir.

10:01.905 --> 10:06.569
Captain, Osborne is the closest thing
we have to an in-house investigator.

10:06.744 --> 10:09.611
And you're going out of house.
How does that make you feel?

10:09.980 --> 10:12.141
- Hostile and uncooperative, sir.
- Fantastic.

10:12.316 --> 10:14.910
Okay. Tom, look, before
this hurricane hit...

10:15.085 --> 10:18.077
I recalled all exercises
except for one...

10:18.255 --> 10:21.315
a six-man Ranger team and their
Black Hat out in the bush.

10:21.792 --> 10:25.125
- We're missing three and the sergeant.
- Not West?

10:25.729 --> 10:27.720
Oh, tell me it wasn't West.

10:28.499 --> 10:32.162
- You know Sergeant West, sir?
- He was our Black Hat.

10:32.336 --> 10:35.134
- That must have been an honor.
- That's one way to put it.

10:35.305 --> 10:37.671
West is a professional, the
face of the modern Army.

10:37.841 --> 10:40.366
You notice I'm no
longer in the Army.

10:40.544 --> 10:42.273
They were due for
pickup at 1830.

10:42.446 --> 10:44.846
So the problem is that
three didn't come back?

10:45.015 --> 10:47.984
No. The problem is, one
of them is dead...

10:48.152 --> 10:50.518
one has a bullet in his
hip and one won't talk.

10:50.687 --> 10:54.487
Now the one who won't talk was
exchanging live fire with the dead one.

10:54.658 --> 10:57.024
I'm assuming that's what
made him the dead one.

10:57.194 --> 10:59.492
Sergeant Mueller, killed
right in front of me.

10:59.663 --> 11:02.029
If Command finds out
you're using a civilian...

11:02.199 --> 11:05.600
with my background, forget it,
they'll cut you a new asshole.

11:05.769 --> 11:09.432
Your involvement's a secret. Anything you
uncover will be credited to Osborne.

11:09.606 --> 11:14.873
- Well, then, let her do it.
- Sir, that is not a bad idea.

11:15.212 --> 11:18.147
Captain, will you
excuse us for a moment?

11:19.516 --> 11:22.952
All due respect to Osborne,
this is way out of her league.

11:23.120 --> 11:25.816
This kid we have in interrogation
requested a Ranger.

11:25.989 --> 11:28.321
Someone he'd never met.
That's you.

11:28.492 --> 11:30.892
Jesus, Bill, he could have
requested a sailboat.

11:31.061 --> 11:34.656
It doesn't mean you have to give it to him.
I don't get this.

11:35.666 --> 11:39.397
Any spooks involved here?
CIA? FBI?

11:40.137 --> 11:41.399
Not exactly.

11:42.005 --> 11:43.734
What does that mean?

11:43.907 --> 11:47.570
There was a group of guys
down here and they...

11:48.178 --> 11:52.774
And they what? Come
on, Bill, spill it.

12:04.161 --> 12:06.220
Permission to speak freely, sir?

12:06.396 --> 12:08.023
Osborne, I swear to God...

12:08.198 --> 12:11.895
you call me sir one more
time, I'm gonna scream.

12:13.637 --> 12:16.902
I know who you are. The DEA is
investigating you for bribery.

12:17.941 --> 12:21.604
Suspicion of bribery. It's
all in the wording, really.

12:21.778 --> 12:24.269
I'm not comfortable having
you involved with this.

12:24.448 --> 12:26.712
Three things: First, you
don't have a choice.

12:26.884 --> 12:29.148
Second, I've never taken
a bribe in my life.

12:29.319 --> 12:32.777
And third, I'm still a little
drunk from earlier today...

12:32.956 --> 12:35.015
so if I skip over
the witty banter...

12:35.192 --> 12:39.526
and move straight into coming on to
you, I hope you don't take offense.

12:46.236 --> 12:48.898
Dog tags identify them as
Sergeant Raymond Dunbar...

12:49.573 --> 12:51.973
and Second Lieutenant
Levi Kendall.

12:52.142 --> 12:54.906
Levi? Who would name
their kid Levi?

12:55.078 --> 12:58.980
General Jonathan Kendall,
of the Joint Chiefs.

12:59.149 --> 13:02.084
Remind me to thank Bill for
mentioning that on the phone.

13:02.252 --> 13:05.085
Kendall Jr. will be unconscious
for at least another hour.

13:05.255 --> 13:07.587
The soldier we're talking
to first is Dunbar.

13:07.758 --> 13:09.885
- Is he in an interrogation room?
- Yes, sir.

13:10.060 --> 13:12.722
- Move him.
- Why?

13:12.896 --> 13:17.128
Interrogation rooms tend to look
suspiciously like interrogation rooms...

13:17.301 --> 13:20.395
which makes people uncomfortable.
Is he cute?

13:20.571 --> 13:23.096
- Excuse me?
- Dunbar, is he cute?

13:24.374 --> 13:27.707
- If you're not gonna take this seriously...
- Is he handsome?

13:27.878 --> 13:29.675
Does he carry himself well?

13:29.846 --> 13:32.679
Does he look you in the
eyes or down at the floor?

13:32.849 --> 13:35.545
Does he have good bones, which
suggests good breeding?

13:35.719 --> 13:36.981
Does he slouch or sit up?

13:37.154 --> 13:40.612
These are questions that reveal a
great deal about a man's character.

13:40.791 --> 13:44.818
Get over yourself for two-and-a-half
seconds and tell me, is he cute?

13:46.797 --> 13:48.526
Yes, sir.

13:49.299 --> 13:51.028
Thank you.

13:51.201 --> 13:54.432
I'll let you know
how it turns out.

13:54.671 --> 13:58.573
Agent Hardy, if this goes to trial
someone is gonna have to testify...

13:58.742 --> 14:02.337
about what's said in interrogation.
And with your colorful background...

14:02.512 --> 14:04.946
you'd be the most impeachable
witness in history.

14:05.282 --> 14:09.719
Now, I may be stuck with you, but
you're definitely stuck with me.

14:13.023 --> 14:16.857
Okay. At some point I want
you to go bad cop on him.

14:18.762 --> 14:23.028
- The signal will be my rubbing my nose.
- Not scratching your balls?

14:23.367 --> 14:25.392
Look for both. Any
donuts around here?

14:25.569 --> 14:28.333
I questioned him for two hours.
He didn't make a sound.

14:28.505 --> 14:30.769
You try poking him with a stick?

14:30.941 --> 14:34.138
Sorry, no. I didn't learn
sophisticated techniques like that.

14:34.311 --> 14:37.508
I bet I can get him to talk
in under three minutes.

14:38.215 --> 14:40.979
Ten bucks. That's without
telling him I'm a Ranger.

14:43.220 --> 14:44.687
Go.

14:46.623 --> 14:50.184
Sergeant Dunbar, good evening.

14:50.360 --> 14:56.162
I'm Tom Hardy. I believe you've already
met the vivacious Captain Osborne.

14:56.500 --> 14:59.492
I understand that you've had a
rough time of it out there...

14:59.670 --> 15:01.661
and that you're not talking.

15:02.105 --> 15:04.596
I'm sure you just want to
get some sleep and food.

15:04.775 --> 15:06.800
Did they feed you yet?

15:15.252 --> 15:17.914
Go on. You can still eat in
front of someone and not talk.

15:18.088 --> 15:20.716
My parents did it for years.

15:29.566 --> 15:31.193
You want another one?

15:31.435 --> 15:32.993
Maybe later.

15:33.170 --> 15:35.263
Okay, Ray, I'm gonna
be upfront with you.

15:35.439 --> 15:38.237
I don't know if you did what
you did in self-defense...

15:38.408 --> 15:40.706
and frankly, I don't care.

15:40.877 --> 15:43.277
The thing is, I made an
agreement with a friend...

15:43.447 --> 15:45.972
to talk to you till your
transport showed up.

15:46.149 --> 15:47.673
So...

15:51.021 --> 15:52.454
You like baseball?

15:54.458 --> 15:57.120
Oh, I could talk
baseball for days.

15:59.763 --> 16:03.995
You know, batting averages, ERAs,
I got statistics in my brain.

16:04.167 --> 16:07.136
I don't know how I remember them.
It's freaky.

16:07.738 --> 16:09.262
You wanna talk baseball?

16:11.174 --> 16:13.574
Oh, come on, Ray, we gotta
talk about something.

16:13.744 --> 16:16.269
We're gonna be here
for six hours.

16:16.980 --> 16:20.279
Come on, who do you like?
Who do you like?

16:21.885 --> 16:24.820
Sir, I don't like baseball.

16:25.522 --> 16:27.012
Why not?

16:29.626 --> 16:31.924
I believe the game of
baseball to be too slow.

16:32.095 --> 16:35.792
Too slow? It's a game of anticipation.
That's the beauty.

16:37.033 --> 16:38.830
Well, sir, I just don't like it.

16:39.002 --> 16:41.334
I'm sorry I don't have
an adequate explanation.

16:41.505 --> 16:45.373
Well, that's all right. I'm not
gonna kneecap you or anything.

16:45.542 --> 16:48.272
Sir, I requested
a fellow Ranger.

16:54.918 --> 16:56.715
I apologize. I just...

16:56.887 --> 17:00.653
It's just that you thought I
looked like a scumbag. I know.

17:00.824 --> 17:02.689
It turns a lot of people off.

17:05.529 --> 17:08.498
You know, I was here in the
75th, under Sergeant West.

17:08.665 --> 17:12.066
Yeah, he had a
wicked-looking blade.

17:12.234 --> 17:14.226
Yeah. He still got that?

17:14.404 --> 17:16.133
Hand-carved. Yes, sir.

17:16.306 --> 17:20.435
Well, the reason I remember is he
would use me as his knife dummy.

17:20.609 --> 17:22.839
- He ever do that to you guys?
- Oh, yeah.

17:23.012 --> 17:25.675
What West used to do is he
would say that he could...

17:25.848 --> 17:29.683
slice a man from stem to sternum,
the stem being your dick, okay?

17:29.853 --> 17:31.411
- I get it.
- Okay. Well, anyway...

17:31.588 --> 17:36.924
if you're his knife dummy, he would just
ram this pipe into your balls all day.

17:37.093 --> 17:40.324
And that was a long day.

17:40.931 --> 17:45.300
By the way, Ray, I promised I would
ask where West and the others are...

17:45.468 --> 17:47.902
and can they be found?

17:49.039 --> 17:51.269
There's no need.

17:52.275 --> 17:53.936
They're dead, aren't they?

17:56.913 --> 17:58.175
Yes, sir.

17:58.882 --> 18:00.281
You kill them?

18:11.127 --> 18:14.688
Look, we got enough on you
to deep-fry your ass!

18:14.865 --> 18:16.730
Back to silent
treatment, fine by me.

18:16.900 --> 18:19.801
- I'm just gonna have to haul your ass...
- Okay, whoa. Time-out.

18:19.970 --> 18:23.770
Look, Ray, this is what you
call "good cop-bad cop."

18:23.940 --> 18:27.501
She shouts. I stand up for you.
You're grateful.

18:27.677 --> 18:30.544
This establishes some
sort of bond of trust.

18:30.714 --> 18:32.614
I don't wanna play
games with you...

18:32.782 --> 18:37.378
so I say we take a break. Okay?
And get you another donut.

18:37.554 --> 18:39.681
You see if you wanna
talk anymore.

18:42.959 --> 18:45.519
- "Deep-fry your ass"?
- You set me up.

18:45.695 --> 18:47.663
I believe somebody
owes me 10 bucks.

18:47.831 --> 18:50.356
You could have told me
what you were planning.

18:50.533 --> 18:52.364
Everybody knows
good cop-bad cop.

18:52.535 --> 18:54.332
By admitting it, I
could gain his trust.

18:57.040 --> 19:00.476
- You think he did it?
- No, sir.

19:01.444 --> 19:02.911
Yes.

19:03.880 --> 19:06.508
What about the
rest of my people?

19:09.786 --> 19:14.348
In 5 1/2 hours, it'll be out of our hands.
I'm gonna have a lot to answer for.

19:14.524 --> 19:17.493
I'd appreciate it if you could
get me some of those answers.

19:19.796 --> 19:23.789
- Why did you ask for a Ranger?
- I'm not telling you what happened.

19:23.967 --> 19:25.958
Why don't you tell
us about the others?

19:26.136 --> 19:28.866
Tell us about the course.
Tell us about Sergeant West.

19:29.039 --> 19:30.870
Is he still the same prick?

19:31.041 --> 19:34.602
I do not care that you
are triple volunteers.

19:34.778 --> 19:38.270
I do not care that you
think you are hard.

19:38.448 --> 19:42.817
And I especially don't give a rat's
fuck what four-star general's dick...

19:42.986 --> 19:47.047
you sucked to get the privilege of
being able stand before me today.

19:48.024 --> 19:53.462
Those of you I deem
unworthy will not remain.

19:53.630 --> 19:56.497
Is that understood? Can I
get a "Hoo-ha, sergeant"?

19:56.666 --> 19:57.928
Hoo-ha, sergeant!

19:58.101 --> 20:01.400
Those of you I find
lacking will quit.

20:01.571 --> 20:06.531
And those of you who refuse to quit
will have a training accident.

20:06.710 --> 20:09.907
This base suffers three
training accidents a year.

20:10.080 --> 20:13.914
Unfortunate accidents that I
will not hesitate to repeat...

20:14.384 --> 20:18.013
if you cross me. Is
that understood?

20:18.188 --> 20:21.646
- Give me a "Hoo-ha, sergeant."
- Hoo-ha, sergeant!

20:21.825 --> 20:24.885
- And what's your name?
- Sergeant, my name is Pike, sergeant.

20:25.061 --> 20:28.929
Pike, surrender your
sidearm for inspection.

20:29.099 --> 20:32.500
What the fuck are you doing?
Have you lost your fucking mind?

20:32.669 --> 20:36.070
- You told me to relinquish...
- Are you talking? Did you speak to me?

20:36.439 --> 20:38.464
Who the fuck told you to speak?!

20:38.641 --> 20:41.576
A Ranger never
relinquishes his weapon!

20:41.745 --> 20:44.771
If George S. Motherfucking Patton
rises from his holy grave...

20:44.948 --> 20:48.748
and asks you for your weapon, you
will not surrender your weapon.

20:48.918 --> 20:51.079
Everybody better give me
a "Hoo-ha, sergeant."

20:51.254 --> 20:53.518
- Hoo-ha, sergeant!
- Now, son...

20:53.690 --> 20:57.251
there are people in this world that
will kill you for no damn reason...

20:57.427 --> 21:00.021
other than something passing
through their mind!

21:00.196 --> 21:04.189
I hail from Biloxi, Mississippi, where
vanilla motherfuckers like that...

21:04.367 --> 21:07.700
used to hang us from trees
by our necks on a whim!

21:08.104 --> 21:11.471
Does that sound like the kind of
fucking place you want to grow up?

21:11.641 --> 21:12.903
Sergeant, no, sergeant!

21:13.076 --> 21:16.910
Are you implying something negative
about the great state of Mississippi?

21:17.080 --> 21:20.948
From the beginning, West had a chip on
his shoulder for this guy named Pike.

21:22.786 --> 21:26.779
By the time we did Green
Hell, it was getting nuts.

21:27.223 --> 21:30.215
Green Hell was 20 days in the
Darien at 40 clicks a day...

21:30.393 --> 21:32.293
with an 80-pound
pack on your back.

21:32.462 --> 21:34.760
We got real used to number
oddities like that.

21:35.498 --> 21:37.932
The course was called Jungle
Leader and the idea...

21:38.101 --> 21:41.161
was to teach you how to think
when you were exhausted.

21:41.471 --> 21:43.996
And West really knew how
to get you exhausted.

21:46.910 --> 21:49.174
We spent our nights doing
escape and evasions...

21:49.345 --> 21:51.279
with live fire snapping
by our heads...

21:51.448 --> 21:53.609
or else up to our noses
in some damn swamp...

21:53.783 --> 21:55.751
slapping bugs and
dodging snakes.

21:56.419 --> 22:00.913
The nights we did mock POW stuff,
they wouldn't let us sleep at all.

22:05.528 --> 22:08.190
We humped over the
Cordillera three times...

22:08.364 --> 22:10.992
all the way to the
Colombian border and back.

22:11.167 --> 22:16.036
Some of that stuff is steep as hell
and the rain never let up for days.

22:16.806 --> 22:18.467
Those packs got heavy
in the rain...

22:18.641 --> 22:23.010
and nobody ever hated anything
like we hated those damn packs.

22:24.013 --> 22:27.005
There was this one escarpment,
it wasn't more than 500 feet...

22:27.183 --> 22:28.980
but, Jesus, it was slippery.

22:29.152 --> 22:29.285
Mr. Pike...

22:29.286 --> 22:31.014
Mr. Pike...

22:31.187 --> 22:34.020
can you tell me the muzzle
velocity of an M-16?

22:35.625 --> 22:37.183
Yeah.

22:40.430 --> 22:43.558
- Eleven hundred, sergeant.
- Eleven hundred what?

22:45.034 --> 22:47.229
Meters per second, sergeant.

22:47.403 --> 22:50.133
Take 40% of that and multiply
it by the exact number...

22:50.306 --> 22:52.638
of each animal Moses took
with him on the Ark.

22:56.746 --> 22:59.476
- Come on.
- Twenty...

23:00.350 --> 23:03.444
Come on. You tired, Mr. Pike?
Too tired to think?

23:03.620 --> 23:07.078
Zero, schmuck. Moses
wasn't on the Ark.

23:07.423 --> 23:09.653
Have you lost it?

23:09.826 --> 23:11.817
Well, tell me this.

23:12.262 --> 23:14.196
What is your weapon?

23:15.732 --> 23:18.030
Your weapon, man. Your weapon.

23:18.401 --> 23:21.768
What keeps you alive and
makes the other guy die?

23:21.938 --> 23:25.374
What is your weapon?

23:26.376 --> 23:28.344
It's your brain, Mr. Pike.

23:28.511 --> 23:31.309
Your noggin. Your noodle. Your smarts.
Your gray matter.

23:31.481 --> 23:33.608
Your poise under fire.

23:33.783 --> 23:38.447
Your wits, when all about
you are losing theirs.

23:38.621 --> 23:42.352
I think you came to this
party unarmed, Mr. Pike.

23:42.859 --> 23:44.952
Take off your pack.

23:46.162 --> 23:47.686
Take it off.

23:53.703 --> 23:56.399
Here, I'll help you. Come on.

24:12.488 --> 24:16.754
You can't complete this march
without a pack, Mr. Pike.

24:16.926 --> 24:23.195
I suggest you go back and get it, even
if it takes 40 days and 40 nights.

24:25.235 --> 24:27.465
That business bothered
a lot of the guys...

24:27.971 --> 24:31.668
even Mueller, who was a redneck you
felt uncomfortable sleeping around.

24:31.841 --> 24:33.069
Dumb shit.

24:41.684 --> 24:45.484
So that's what we were coming
back from yesterday afternoon.

24:46.322 --> 24:49.849
We figured we'd finally get
a shower and a hot meal.

24:50.226 --> 24:52.820
I mean, we were
the walking dead.

24:52.996 --> 24:56.488
We were about as ragged-out
as a man could ever get.

25:03.339 --> 25:05.364
Here comes Master West himself.

25:09.679 --> 25:13.342
What we have here
is an opportunity.

25:13.516 --> 25:17.247
A unique opportunity for a
spectacular training event.

25:17.420 --> 25:21.288
Dunbar. Kendall. Mueller.
Nunez. Castro.

25:21.457 --> 25:26.656
Drop your packs. Weapons only. Muster
at the east LZ in two minutes.

25:26.829 --> 25:29.457
- Jesus Christ.
- What was that, Mr. Pike?

25:31.467 --> 25:34.027
You think a little rain is
inappropriate for combat?

25:34.203 --> 25:36.603
That the game should be
called on account of weather?

25:36.773 --> 25:38.673
Are you concerned
for their safety?

25:38.975 --> 25:40.340
Sergeant...

25:41.911 --> 25:43.401
What?

25:45.048 --> 25:50.042
- No, sergeant.
- Good, then you can join them.

25:52.288 --> 25:54.848
Those are the guys that went
on the exercise with you?

25:56.125 --> 25:59.253
Yeah, and that is
all I'm saying.

26:02.598 --> 26:03.860
Ray?

26:08.004 --> 26:09.528
You smoke?

26:09.706 --> 26:13.369
Is this a trick where you won't give
me a cigarette till I tell you more?

26:13.543 --> 26:16.910
No, I just forgot mine in the car,
and I was hoping that you had some.

26:22.018 --> 26:24.384
My brand. My lucky day.

26:31.127 --> 26:32.958
You seem like a good guy, Ray.

26:33.129 --> 26:36.257
You carried Kendall
wounded to the pickup...

26:36.432 --> 26:38.127
but I just don't understand.

26:38.301 --> 26:41.793
What did you do to make
Mueller want to kill you?

26:44.340 --> 26:46.274
I'm not saying anything else.

26:51.247 --> 26:54.808
I just don't understand why
he asked for a Ranger.

26:54.984 --> 26:58.715
The man's in trouble.
Never leave a man behind.

26:58.888 --> 27:02.324
- So?
- Ranger code.

27:02.759 --> 27:05.523
Never leave a man behind.

27:06.362 --> 27:08.296
What's the matter?

27:10.733 --> 27:13.395
This place gives me the willies.

27:13.569 --> 27:16.834
- Not the happiest of memories, huh?
- No.

27:19.475 --> 27:22.444
He's the son of a general, so
go easy on him. Kid gloves.

27:22.612 --> 27:24.739
- All right.
- I mean it. Kid gloves.

27:24.914 --> 27:26.745
I got it.

27:27.517 --> 27:30.247
Yeah. Thanks.

27:30.720 --> 27:32.517
Tommy, that you?

27:32.688 --> 27:35.248
Pete Vilmer, as I live and breathe.
How are you?

27:35.425 --> 27:38.087
- How are you? I'm good.
- Osborne, Pete Vilmer.

27:38.261 --> 27:41.094
I know. Let me guess, you
two trained together?

27:41.264 --> 27:43.664
Guilty as charged, Julie-bird.
What are you doing here?

27:43.833 --> 27:46.802
- You're not getting all nostalgic on me?
- No, I can't tell you...

27:46.969 --> 27:48.459
- I'm running this joint.
- No.

27:48.638 --> 27:51.436
Yeah. We're busy as hell too.
Packing up supplies...

27:51.607 --> 27:53.438
getting ready for
the move stateside.

27:53.609 --> 27:55.873
Who'd have thunk it? Pete
Vilmer, bettering society.

27:56.045 --> 27:58.445
Shall we see Kendall or would
you like to continue...

27:58.614 --> 28:00.673
the backslapping for
a couple of minutes?

28:00.850 --> 28:02.841
"Julie-bird."

28:03.019 --> 28:06.352
Now if I were a smart
man, and I am not...

28:06.522 --> 28:12.358
I could come to the conclusion that
you two saw each other socially.

28:13.229 --> 28:17.325
Oh, I've seen you around
the base before, but...

28:17.667 --> 28:22.070
well, are you in the Army or...?

28:22.238 --> 28:24.968
Coast Guard. We're worried
about Florida beaches.

28:25.141 --> 28:29.373
Oh, I've seen you before.
You were in the newspaper.

28:29.545 --> 28:33.174
You're that DEA agent with
friends in low places.

28:33.349 --> 28:35.647
Oh, the price of fame.

28:35.818 --> 28:38.651
We were wondering if you'd
answer a few questions for us?

28:40.089 --> 28:45.220
Oh, no. I'm really fatigued.
I feel all drugged-up.

28:45.394 --> 28:48.295
Our collective hearts weep.

28:48.464 --> 28:51.092
Well, we just wanna know
what happened out there.

28:51.267 --> 28:54.430
Oh, you wanna know
what happened?

28:54.971 --> 28:57.405
Well, there are degrees
of truth, captain.

28:57.573 --> 29:02.067
You know, there are always degrees
and things are not what they seem.

29:02.245 --> 29:03.837
You know, this is...

29:04.013 --> 29:06.413
It is too late and I am too
tired to give a shit...

29:06.582 --> 29:10.143
about some pissant lieutenant's
bad version of intrigue.

29:10.319 --> 29:13.948
You're trying too hard, Levi.
You know how I can tell?

29:14.123 --> 29:16.523
Because you're sweating,
and you're sweating...

29:16.692 --> 29:20.355
because you don't know how
much Dunbar told us already.

29:22.298 --> 29:23.788
Excuse me.

29:28.371 --> 29:31.932
- Those were kid gloves?
- I thought I did pretty well up till the end.

29:32.108 --> 29:34.474
You mean when you yelled
at him and walked out?

29:34.644 --> 29:38.978
Well, that would be the end, yeah. We'll
play it differently when we go back.

29:39.148 --> 29:41.639
Go back? We just blew it.

29:42.985 --> 29:46.182
- I thought you didn't have any cigarettes.
- I lied.

29:46.355 --> 29:49.654
- Will you just wait? Just wait.
- For what?

29:50.993 --> 29:54.759
Excuse me. A patient
is asking for you.

29:55.197 --> 29:57.131
Shall we?

29:59.035 --> 30:01.868
My father is what you would
call a very powerful man.

30:02.038 --> 30:07.135
- So we've heard.
- Oh, come on, you know...

30:07.310 --> 30:09.335
you don't know the half of it.
I mean...

30:09.512 --> 30:15.678
You know, all my life he's made
me feel weak and insignificant.

30:17.353 --> 30:22.154
Yeah, I think that is reason why I
joined the military in the first place.

30:22.325 --> 30:24.452
And how is that going for you?

30:24.627 --> 30:28.085
Oh, it's horrible. I
fucking hate the military.

30:28.764 --> 30:31.324
You're terrified of
him, aren't you?

30:33.035 --> 30:35.503
No, no, we just hate each other.

30:37.673 --> 30:43.908
You know, and normally he wouldn't
lift a finger to do anything for me...

30:46.649 --> 30:49.812
but the one thing he cannot
stand is a scandal...

30:49.986 --> 30:53.888
and you know, a joint chief...

30:54.056 --> 30:58.857
with a homosexual son in the military
definitely qualifies as scandal.

30:59.028 --> 31:01.826
Well, that blows "Don't ask,
don't tell" out of the water.

31:02.031 --> 31:05.626
So is this family history
lesson coming to a point?

31:06.302 --> 31:12.502
About four months ago, I began
a relationship with a local...

31:13.109 --> 31:19.014
and my father decided to intercede.
And Colonel Styles...

31:19.181 --> 31:23.948
made the incident quiet. But
according to my father...

31:24.120 --> 31:26.987
transferred me into
West's training course.

31:27.156 --> 31:30.023
And, you know, West
just hated that.

31:30.192 --> 31:32.922
He made sure everyone knew
where I was and all that.

31:33.095 --> 31:36.189
Couldn't kick you out so he
wanted you to quit on your own.

31:37.066 --> 31:39.432
Well, he wanted more than that.

31:39.602 --> 31:42.400
More intrigue, Levi?

31:43.439 --> 31:44.838
Yes.

31:46.509 --> 31:52.914
I swear to God, you will swim the canal!
The teams are as follows...

31:53.416 --> 31:56.180
Dunbar and...

31:57.219 --> 31:59.687
Mueller.

32:00.089 --> 32:03.525
Pike and Nunez.

32:04.760 --> 32:06.955
Kendall and...

32:07.129 --> 32:08.653
Castro.

32:08.831 --> 32:14.167
You have one minute to touch down.
Get your shit together!

32:15.071 --> 32:17.232
That's when he did it.

32:23.112 --> 32:26.104
He was threatening my life.
It was clear as day.

32:27.516 --> 32:30.144
Did anyone else
see or hear this?

32:30.319 --> 32:33.550
No, of course not. There was
a helicopter, you know?

32:33.723 --> 32:36.988
- Nobody could hear anything.
- I don't know how familiar you are...

32:37.159 --> 32:40.287
with investigative work, but
there's this thing called motive.

32:41.063 --> 32:42.963
And you just gave yourself one.

32:43.132 --> 32:46.568
Well, you wanted to
know what happened...

32:46.736 --> 32:50.638
- and I'm telling you the truth.
- What happened to degrees?

32:53.209 --> 32:55.074
I didn't kill him.

32:57.113 --> 32:58.774
Then who did?

33:02.151 --> 33:04.176
Thirty seconds to LZ.

33:04.353 --> 33:08.119
Click in! On the skids!
Lose the communicators!

33:09.592 --> 33:12.789
I did want to tell someone, but
Mueller would've just laughed...

33:12.962 --> 33:15.055
and Nunez wouldn't
have given a shit.

33:15.231 --> 33:18.098
I suppose neither
would Pike or Dunbar.

33:19.602 --> 33:21.866
Of course, West had me
paired with Castro...

33:22.037 --> 33:25.598
who treated me like a leper
from the day that I met him.

33:27.143 --> 33:30.203
I started getting it in my head
that maybe West had paid him.

33:30.379 --> 33:33.837
Maybe he was the one who was supposed
to give me a training accident.

34:08.918 --> 34:11.409
All I could think of was
West was out here...

34:11.587 --> 34:13.782
somewhere in this
godforsaken swamp...

34:14.690 --> 34:18.989
making us stalk around in this
hurricane, and just waiting.

34:28.504 --> 34:31.905
Hey! What the fuck are you doing?
Huh?

34:32.074 --> 34:35.737
- This is fucking ridiculous!
- Shut up and shoot something!

34:58.067 --> 35:00.228
I was terrified, and I
wasn't about to be...

35:00.402 --> 35:03.599
the victim of some
discriminative hate crime.

35:05.407 --> 35:08.968
You know, maybe I should say I
wasn't scared at all, but I was.

35:09.144 --> 35:10.702
I was terrified.

35:11.747 --> 35:14.739
You know, enough to want
to murder somebody.

35:15.351 --> 35:16.909
But you didn't.

35:27.096 --> 35:28.393
Come on!

35:29.164 --> 35:30.893
Come on!

36:01.397 --> 36:03.365
Is that West?

36:11.040 --> 36:13.531
Whose area is this?

36:28.524 --> 36:30.048
West.

36:31.193 --> 36:33.787
- What did you do?
- We found him like this.

36:37.499 --> 36:39.262
You kill him?

36:39.435 --> 36:44.202
We found him like this.
Where's Pike?

36:48.410 --> 36:50.071
Come on, tell me! Where's Pike?

36:52.214 --> 36:53.545
- We got separated.
- Yeah?

36:53.716 --> 36:56.844
- Yeah, we did.
- Before or after the explosion?

37:02.992 --> 37:06.086
Before or after the explosion?

37:06.895 --> 37:08.760
- I don't know.
- What do you mean?

37:09.431 --> 37:13.299
I mean, I don't fucking know, okay? We
got separated, so shut the fuck up!

37:13.469 --> 37:16.996
Shut up! Exercise over!
Get out of here!

37:22.244 --> 37:24.144
Radio's had it.

37:25.214 --> 37:27.546
- Are we gonna leave him like this?
- We have to.

37:27.716 --> 37:30.583
The MPs will secure the site
till the CID gets here.

37:30.753 --> 37:33.415
- What about Pike?
- I'm not waiting for Pike.

37:33.589 --> 37:37.685
You can if you want. Fucking
do something, okay?

38:08.157 --> 38:09.954
Where you been?

38:10.125 --> 38:11.752
You guys all right?

38:11.927 --> 38:13.986
Where's Pike?

38:15.764 --> 38:17.095
- West is dead.
- What?

38:17.266 --> 38:18.528
What happened?

38:18.700 --> 38:20.793
He took a phosphorus
grenade in the back.

38:20.969 --> 38:22.766
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

38:22.938 --> 38:25.202
He's out there smoldering.

38:25.374 --> 38:27.069
How long have you
guys been here?

38:27.242 --> 38:31.076
Ten minutes. We finished the course,
and just before we got here...

38:31.246 --> 38:34.511
- we heard an explosion.
- That's your story?

38:34.683 --> 38:37.811
- Yeah, that's our story, Nunez.
- Watch it, motherfucker!

38:38.420 --> 38:40.115
Hey! Hey! Stop!

38:42.558 --> 38:44.219
What?

38:45.027 --> 38:48.326
Hey, calm down! Everybody
just calm down!

38:49.364 --> 38:51.423
Where the hell is Pike?

38:51.600 --> 38:52.965
We got separated, okay?

38:53.135 --> 38:56.536
She just doesn't remember if it was
before or after the explosion.

38:56.705 --> 39:00.368
- Before the explosion, all right?
- Oh, so now you remember? Now?

39:00.542 --> 39:02.009
- Yeah.
- Now you remember?

39:02.177 --> 39:05.442
- Before the explosion. Hear me?
- So you think Pike did it?

39:05.614 --> 39:09.880
Does anybody know the shit that
we are in, how fucked we all are?

39:10.052 --> 39:11.610
Kendall!

39:15.023 --> 39:16.786
Let me see your grenade, Nunez.

39:16.959 --> 39:20.861
- Yeah, let's see it, Nunez.
- Nunez?

39:21.463 --> 39:25.092
- Let's see that.
- Get off! Fuck off.

39:25.267 --> 39:28.498
This is bullshit, man.
This is so bullshit.

39:28.904 --> 39:31.839
I'm so sick of you guys. Okay.

39:32.474 --> 39:36.342
Are you happy now? Here it is.
One. Here it is. You see it?

39:36.512 --> 39:40.209
So sorry to disappoint you. You're not
gonna have a strip-search tonight.

39:40.682 --> 39:44.015
The man is fucking dead, all right?
So, what happened?

39:47.823 --> 39:51.691
- Must be a level three out there.
- You okay?

39:51.860 --> 39:56.058
- Yeah.
- Pike, you got your grenade?

39:56.231 --> 39:58.426
No, I used it.

40:00.869 --> 40:02.803
You know West is dead?

40:04.306 --> 40:06.433
Of course I do.

40:07.743 --> 40:09.472
I killed him.

40:10.412 --> 40:14.246
- He admitted it?
- He thought we would all be on board.

40:14.416 --> 40:17.817
He was that type
of guy, I guess.

40:17.986 --> 40:22.286
You know, apparently, Pike wasn't
even his real name. He changed it...

40:22.457 --> 40:24.288
Come on, come on, focus, Levi.

40:24.459 --> 40:27.758
Okay, fine. So then
Mueller went after him...

40:27.930 --> 40:31.229
and we had to pull him
back and calm him down...

40:31.400 --> 40:35.234
and we said that we would turn Pike in.
So then everybody agreed...

40:35.404 --> 40:37.065
and...

40:37.239 --> 40:38.672
Kendall!

40:40.042 --> 40:41.737
Come here.

40:45.547 --> 40:47.174
Come here!

40:50.352 --> 40:51.979
Come here.

40:56.992 --> 41:00.189
Don't tell me that you ain't
glad that West is dead.

41:00.362 --> 41:02.762
Now we got a opportunity here.

41:04.533 --> 41:07.001
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- What I'm talking about...

41:07.169 --> 41:10.627
is we can all walk out of here heroes.
All right?

41:10.806 --> 41:14.765
Now, all we gotta do is get
rid of Mueller and Nunez.

41:15.143 --> 41:17.168
We get the other guys
to play along...

41:17.346 --> 41:21.783
and we can be the men that took
down our sergeant's killers.

41:21.950 --> 41:26.853
All we gotta do is
tell the story right.

41:29.057 --> 41:31.150
You're out of your mind.

41:37.065 --> 41:39.966
After I woke up, I saw
Pike and Dunbar talking.

42:17.205 --> 42:19.036
No! No!

42:21.443 --> 42:23.570
You sack of shit!

42:47.269 --> 42:51.330
It was just a reflex. Castro
had already been hit.

42:51.506 --> 42:54.202
I must've passed out, because
the next thing I knew...

43:00.949 --> 43:05.648
- Mueller was chasing Dunbar?
- Because he had shot Castro.

43:05.821 --> 43:07.413
Why did he carry you out?

43:07.589 --> 43:11.753
I don't know. Maybe he wanted
somebody to cover for him.

43:12.794 --> 43:18.198
But I can't. I know what I saw.
And he killed those men.

43:20.235 --> 43:21.964
And you'll testify to this?

43:22.804 --> 43:24.271
Of course.

43:26.575 --> 43:28.600
Okay. That's it.

43:29.711 --> 43:31.440
Agent Hardy?

43:32.881 --> 43:34.849
What did Dunbar say to you?

43:37.185 --> 43:38.982
Let's go have a beer.

43:39.154 --> 43:41.213
I don't drink beer.
What about the case?

43:41.390 --> 43:44.018
You don't drink beer?
Who doesn't drink beer?

43:44.192 --> 43:47.059
Me. What about the case?

43:49.798 --> 43:53.529
The case is done, with two
hours and 40 minutes to spare.

43:53.702 --> 43:57.763
I thought we'd get a beer and I'd get
to flirt with you. What do you think?

43:57.939 --> 44:00.373
- You believed Kendall?
- Absolutely.

44:00.542 --> 44:04.308
Because Dunbar wouldn't tell us everything.
Why? Because he did it.

44:04.479 --> 44:08.973
No. Dunbar came back for Kendall. I
don't think he's capable of murder.

44:09.151 --> 44:11.813
- How long you been doing this?
- What's that have to do with it?

44:11.987 --> 44:13.215
That means less than a year.

44:13.388 --> 44:17.381
Osborne, murder is basic. No
conspiracies, no grand mysteries...

44:17.559 --> 44:20.824
no puppet masters behind the
scenes pulling the strings.

44:20.996 --> 44:23.191
Everyone is capable of murder.

44:24.933 --> 44:27.367
Dunbar's our guy.

44:27.536 --> 44:31.199
Look, there's no physical proof.
We need a confession.

44:31.373 --> 44:33.841
From Dunbar? Forget it.

44:34.409 --> 44:37.970
You're not gonna talk that kid into
giving himself up for the death penalty.

44:38.146 --> 44:40.774
- Nevertheless.
- Nevertheless what?

44:40.949 --> 44:44.180
Kendall will testify.
That's all we need.

44:46.121 --> 44:48.385
It's not enough for me.

44:50.659 --> 44:50.792
Hey, Ray. Had a nice talk
with your buddy, Kendall.

44:50.793 --> 44:54.023
Hey, Ray. Had a nice talk
with your buddy, Kendall.

44:54.196 --> 44:57.165
- Seems you killed a bunch of people.
- That son of a bitch.

44:57.332 --> 45:00.233
- Well, that'd be my reaction too.
- He's lying.

45:00.402 --> 45:03.530
Why didn't you say something? We
would've dropped the charges.

45:03.705 --> 45:05.070
I'm serious, goddamn it!

45:05.240 --> 45:08.767
Fuck your "serious." Right now, we'd
take the word of a crackhead over yours.

45:08.944 --> 45:11.970
You got something to say?
Say it.

45:13.281 --> 45:15.511
Did Kendall tell you
about the drugs?

45:15.684 --> 45:19.211
- About the business Mueller ran?
- What drugs?

45:19.688 --> 45:22.714
He sold them out of the
hospital for 50 bucks a pop.

45:22.891 --> 45:25.587
West is easier to handle when
you can't feel the pain.

45:25.760 --> 45:30.129
Oh, that's good, Ray. You know I'm DEA
and you figure you say "drugs"...

45:30.298 --> 45:32.698
- and I'm all ears, right?
- It's not like that.

45:32.868 --> 45:36.497
Then why didn't you bring this up
before you were accused of murder?

45:36.671 --> 45:40.630
No, wait! Don't say it.
I'll tell you.

45:40.809 --> 45:44.142
Drug charges in the Army come
with a 20-year sentence.

45:44.312 --> 45:47.281
You figured Kendall fucked you,
you'll fuck him right back.

45:47.449 --> 45:51.010
- I didn't shoot West.
- I know. Pike did.

45:52.220 --> 45:54.154
You think you know
everything, don't you?

45:54.589 --> 45:56.989
You haven't even
scratched the surface.

45:58.360 --> 46:02.387
I know enough to know that
you've got two choices.

46:02.931 --> 46:07.527
You can sign a confession and spend
the rest of your life in a cell...

46:07.702 --> 46:12.901
or you can tell us to fuck
off and you'll be hanged.

46:13.441 --> 46:15.136
Now...

46:16.444 --> 46:19.413
am I scratching
your surface yet?

46:24.152 --> 46:26.120
Dumb bastard!

46:27.289 --> 46:29.587
Why the fuck wasn't
he in restraints?

46:30.191 --> 46:32.182
- Excuse me?
- The next time...

46:32.360 --> 46:35.261
I wanna borrow your
balls, I'll ask you.

46:35.497 --> 46:37.260
Tom? Where are you going?

46:37.432 --> 46:40.458
- I'm done. I'm out of here.
- Wait. What about the confession?

46:41.102 --> 46:44.071
Why don't you confess? The only
reason you brought me here...

46:44.239 --> 46:48.005
was to protect your career. People
are dead and you don't give a shit.

46:48.176 --> 46:50.144
- What are you taking about?
- About West!

46:50.312 --> 46:54.214
You're the base commander. You know
what he's all about and you stood by.

46:54.382 --> 46:57.545
It was just a matter of time
before someone fragged his ass!

46:57.719 --> 47:01.883
He deserved it. Now, there!
There's your fucking confession.

47:02.891 --> 47:04.620
Hardy?

47:05.126 --> 47:11.224
Hardy! What about Dunbar? What about
what he said about the drugs?

47:11.399 --> 47:15.768
You are incredible! If someone
said "Santa Claus," you'd say:

47:15.937 --> 47:19.964
"You can't leave. We haven't
explored the flying reindeer angle!"

47:20.141 --> 47:23.907
- You fucking coward!
- No, no, wait! You stop right there.

47:24.079 --> 47:30.018
I was there! I was tortured by that guy!
I wanted him dead 15 years ago!

47:30.185 --> 47:33.848
And now, I should feel bad about
someone who offed him? Forget it.

47:34.022 --> 47:36.183
- No can do.
- So fuck the Army, right?

47:36.391 --> 47:39.019
- Fuck the Army and fuck those kids too.
- That's right.

47:39.194 --> 47:42.789
Yeah, all they wanted to do is serve
their country and take a stand...

47:42.964 --> 47:46.661
- and protect assholes like you!
- Oh, don't you even start.

47:46.835 --> 47:49.895
Don't you talk to me like
some recruiting poster...

47:50.071 --> 47:53.336
- because I did my time!
- Yeah, please. Oh, yeah.

47:53.508 --> 47:56.068
- And you couldn't hack it!
- Yeah.

47:58.346 --> 48:02.282
You were like me once. You believed
in the whole honor and duty thing...

48:02.450 --> 48:05.578
and trying to make a difference.
Isn't that what you said?

48:05.754 --> 48:11.351
- I was trying to get your number.
- 334-5644.

48:11.793 --> 48:15.661
- Thank you.
- You believed it. I saw it in your eyes.

48:15.830 --> 48:20.699
You believed in it and those kids did too.
Now they'll never tell their story.

48:20.869 --> 48:24.532
Never gonna get to expose West
for the monster you say he was.

48:26.107 --> 48:28.439
I thought you wanted me gone.

48:29.244 --> 48:31.371
You grew on me.

48:31.780 --> 48:34.806
Look, I'm gonna go in there, and
I'm gonna talk to Kendall...

48:34.983 --> 48:38.419
and to Dunbar, and I'm gonna try
to figure this whole mess out...

48:38.586 --> 48:42.579
because I care what happened out there.
And I think you do too.

48:46.528 --> 48:50.225
- "I didn't shoot West."
- What?

48:51.800 --> 48:56.601
That's what Dunbar said. "I didn't
shoot West." West wasn't shot.

48:56.771 --> 48:59.535
Kendall said he was burned
by a phosphorus grenade.

49:00.141 --> 49:02.769
Dunbar never saw the body.

49:13.154 --> 49:16.555
Hey, look, I apologize.

49:21.529 --> 49:24.555
- You saw West's body?
- Of course I did.

49:24.733 --> 49:27.793
- Where?
- Down by the creek bed.

49:28.603 --> 49:30.662
- And he was shot?
- Yeah.

49:30.839 --> 49:32.830
What about the
phosphorus grenade?

49:33.908 --> 49:38.709
One went off, yeah, but it didn't
touch him. I thought you knew this.

49:38.880 --> 49:40.541
Tell us.

50:00.535 --> 50:03.299
- What did you do?
- We found him like this.

50:06.341 --> 50:07.808
You kill him?

50:08.376 --> 50:10.105
We found him like this!

50:10.278 --> 50:14.009
Stop. Kendall said that only
Nunez showed up at the body.

50:14.182 --> 50:17.276
- You were at the bunker with Mueller.
- He's lying.

50:17.452 --> 50:21.445
I was at the body. We didn't see Mueller
till we got back to the bunker.

50:24.125 --> 50:28.084
- Where you been?
- West. He's dead.

50:28.263 --> 50:29.525
Back up.

50:29.697 --> 50:32.359
- Mueller was alone in the bunker?
- Yeah.

50:32.534 --> 50:34.092
What are you doing here alone?

50:35.904 --> 50:39.431
Pike and I got separated, then
I heard gunfire. It was close.

50:40.275 --> 50:43.767
Well, so did we. Why
you didn't come?

50:47.048 --> 50:49.312
So where's your grenade?

50:57.959 --> 51:02.089
And I didn't buy it, but
Mueller still had his grenade.

51:04.032 --> 51:06.262
At least you and
Kendall agree on that.

51:06.434 --> 51:08.425
Okay, what happened next?

51:09.838 --> 51:11.772
Pike came back.

51:13.975 --> 51:15.909
Mueller, what the
hell happened to you?

51:16.077 --> 51:19.410
Where were you? One minute you're
next to me, the next you're gone...

51:19.581 --> 51:23.779
- the sky lights up like Christmas.
- Where've you been, Jay?

51:23.952 --> 51:28.889
There's a hurricane out there, okay? I
couldn't find the spot. My radio's busted.

51:30.091 --> 51:33.185
- Where's West?
- Yeah, right.

51:33.361 --> 51:35.022
Shut up.

51:36.531 --> 51:38.260
West is dead.

51:38.733 --> 51:40.223
What?

51:42.971 --> 51:47.465
- Where've you been, Jay?
- I said, I couldn't...

51:50.612 --> 51:54.742
No, no, no, no. No.

51:56.384 --> 51:57.681
Fuck you.

51:58.786 --> 52:03.951
- Fuck you! No! Stop it! No!
- Okay, hello!

52:09.697 --> 52:11.858
We just wanna see your pack.

52:12.367 --> 52:17.703
- We wanna see your pack because...
- Why?

52:17.872 --> 52:21.968
Because whoever shot the sarge
popped a grenade first. That's why.

52:22.143 --> 52:25.203
A dead body shows up and just put
it on the darkest face in the room?

52:25.380 --> 52:27.575
- It's not like that and you know it.
- Do I?

52:28.516 --> 52:30.609
Do I, Dunbar?

52:33.354 --> 52:38.451
I just want you, papi,
to show them your pack.

52:39.761 --> 52:41.490
Right now.

52:51.606 --> 52:53.073
Good.

53:04.986 --> 53:06.385
Tie him up.

53:09.991 --> 53:12.755
Ray? Come here.

53:14.696 --> 53:17.563
Come here close, I wanna talk to you.
Come on.

53:19.834 --> 53:21.495
We're friends, right?

53:26.040 --> 53:29.134
- Ray, we're friends, right?
- Yeah.

53:29.310 --> 53:32.905
Well then, come on, man, untie me!
You know that I didn't do this.

53:33.748 --> 53:37.684
- You hated West more than any of us.
- Maybe, but not enough to be a killer.

53:38.252 --> 53:42.120
- You're the one missing a grenade.
- Anybody could have taken that out.

53:42.290 --> 53:45.453
Did you check your pack
coming in on the bird?

53:48.262 --> 53:51.026
Look, you know I don't
have this in me.

53:51.532 --> 53:54.000
- If not you, then who?
- Mueller, that's who.

53:54.202 --> 53:55.499
Oh, come on, man.

53:55.670 --> 53:59.265
We were scanning the area together
then he just ups and disappears?

53:59.440 --> 54:02.273
- That's what he says about you.
- Who you gonna believe...

54:02.443 --> 54:04.377
a redneck or your friend?

54:07.015 --> 54:09.711
- Listen, check my pack.
- Why?

54:09.884 --> 54:13.581
That's a combat cocktail.
Demerol and anabolics.

54:13.755 --> 54:16.747
- Mueller gave it to me.
- You're lying, man.

54:17.992 --> 54:22.725
Does that look like I'm lying? It kills
the pain, focuses the brain, man.

54:22.897 --> 54:25.764
I've been using for about
eight weeks solid.

54:25.933 --> 54:29.596
After that first night, man, it was bad.
Malnutrition and exposure.

54:29.771 --> 54:34.970
I needed something to keep me from
crashing and Mueller hooked me up.

54:35.143 --> 54:39.102
The way I see it, West knew. He
found out and was gonna report him.

54:39.280 --> 54:41.214
- But they killed him first.
- They?

54:41.382 --> 54:46.217
Yes! Mueller and Castro. They
must've sabotaged the radios and...

54:46.387 --> 54:50.118
one of them must've taken a grenade
out of my pack on the chopper.

54:56.431 --> 55:00.026
Who popped white? What
the hell's going on?!

55:00.201 --> 55:02.795
I don't know, sarge! I
don't know what happened!

55:07.175 --> 55:08.836
Get down!

55:16.250 --> 55:18.309
You saw West's body.
How was he killed?

55:19.554 --> 55:21.181
His chest was hamburger, Jake.

55:21.389 --> 55:25.155
See, that's close range. You go
full-auto on somebody, close range...

55:25.326 --> 55:29.353
they're gonna be swimming in blood.
Look at me. I don't have a drop on me.

55:29.564 --> 55:33.830
Now, how about Mueller? When I
walked in, he wasn't wearing shit.

55:35.002 --> 55:37.300
- I don't know, man.
- What don't you know?

55:37.472 --> 55:40.032
This is a lot of shit to digest!
I gotta think!

55:40.308 --> 55:44.506
Come on, Ray, man, we don't have
time to think! We need to go now!

55:46.948 --> 55:49.314
Look. No, listen.

55:49.484 --> 55:52.851
Let's wait till we get back, then
we'll tell everything to the MPs.

55:53.020 --> 55:54.544
If we wait, I am a dead man.

55:54.722 --> 55:57.589
I have a black face and there
are a hundred men out there...

55:57.758 --> 55:59.851
dying to testify how
much I hated West.

56:00.027 --> 56:04.396
My court-martial will take five minutes.
It's me or them. I don't got that time.

56:04.565 --> 56:06.692
You gotta make up
your mind, man.

56:09.270 --> 56:12.171
Ray. Untie me.

56:16.277 --> 56:18.006
Come on, Ray.

56:23.651 --> 56:26.484
What the hell are you doing?
Hey, wake up!

56:27.121 --> 56:30.022
- Hey, hey. This place is gonna go!
- Shut the fuck up, Pike!

56:30.191 --> 56:32.318
- You were gonna cut him loose!
- Why?

56:32.527 --> 56:35.963
- Because I didn't do it, Nunez!
- We all know what you did, Pike.

56:36.130 --> 56:39.190
Yeah, where's your shirt, Mueller?
Ask him where his shirt is!

56:39.700 --> 56:41.895
My shirt? I tossed it.
I was soaking wet.

56:42.103 --> 56:45.231
That's a convenient excuse for the
murderer. He tossed his bloody shirt.

56:45.406 --> 56:50.139
- I was freezing from the hurricane!
- So you took your shirt off?

56:50.311 --> 56:54.771
I wasn't wearing a poncho, goddamn it!
Hey, what about him?

56:54.949 --> 56:56.780
Maybe you brought
an extra shirt.

56:56.951 --> 56:59.579
- We have to go.
- We're not going anywhere.

56:59.754 --> 57:04.157
Sergeant Mueller, you are under military
arrest for the murder of Sergeant West.

57:04.325 --> 57:06.418
- You have no authority...
- It doesn't matter...

57:06.594 --> 57:08.721
because you will be
charged with murder!

57:08.896 --> 57:11.694
- Shut up, Pike.
- You will be court-martialed...

57:11.866 --> 57:13.458
- What are you doing?
- I said, shut up!

57:13.634 --> 57:17.730
- Shut up, you dumb fucking nigger!
- You fucking white-trash motherfucker!

57:17.905 --> 57:19.463
I saw you do it!

57:20.875 --> 57:22.775
Jesus!

57:26.647 --> 57:29.912
- Oh, my God.
- He wouldn't shut the fuck up!

57:31.452 --> 57:33.818
So you killed him?

57:34.889 --> 57:36.151
Put the gun away!

57:38.726 --> 57:40.591
- You too?
- I'm sorry, Ray.

57:40.761 --> 57:46.199
Okay. Pike got free. He got a weapon and
he came after us. That's our story.

57:46.367 --> 57:49.894
- West was one thing, but this is...
- Shut up! Shut up, Mueller!

57:50.104 --> 57:52.698
We have two dead bodies and
a story that explains them.

57:52.873 --> 57:55.398
That's what we're gonna say.

57:57.678 --> 58:01.444
- You're either with us or against us.
- Castro, put it down!

58:01.649 --> 58:03.480
Which is it?

58:04.318 --> 58:06.445
Castro!

58:11.058 --> 58:13.322
Goddamn it, now we're gonna
have to shoot them both.

58:55.236 --> 58:57.602
Can I get some more coffee?

59:00.541 --> 59:02.168
Can I get another cup of coffee?

59:02.343 --> 59:05.904
Yeah. Sure. Yeah.

59:06.080 --> 59:11.643
Okay. So the plan was kill
West, blame it on Pike.

59:11.819 --> 59:15.050
Right. And for that to work,
okay, you need a witness.

59:15.222 --> 59:16.985
- Dunbar.
- Exactly.

59:17.158 --> 59:20.821
So it's a good plan,
but it goes wrong.

59:20.995 --> 59:23.190
Mueller flips out and
shoots their fall guy...

59:23.397 --> 59:26.855
so they have to bring Dunbar and
Kendall into their cover story.

59:27.034 --> 59:30.868
Right. And Kendall might've agreed if the
hurricane hadn't butt-fucked the bunker.

59:31.639 --> 59:32.936
"Butt-fucked the bunker"?

59:33.107 --> 59:35.234
Well, I just... Well, you know.

59:37.445 --> 59:39.106
Happy endings.
What do you think?

59:41.682 --> 59:44.242
I think we're gonna need proof.

59:45.820 --> 59:49.051
Ray, you're gonna have to put
what you said in writing.

59:50.491 --> 59:53.892
And, Ray? Ray? For you to have any
chance of coming out of this...

59:54.061 --> 59:58.464
we need to corroborate your testimony.
Otherwise, this is just another story.

01:00:06.107 --> 01:00:09.736
Pike said the supplier was
somebody over at the hospital.

01:00:09.944 --> 01:00:11.707
Guy named Vilmer.

01:00:19.954 --> 01:00:24.789
Oh, my God. I haven't had
one of these since college.

01:00:25.860 --> 01:00:30.729
- How long you and Pete been together?
- On and off for two years.

01:00:32.466 --> 01:00:34.400
Serious?

01:00:35.436 --> 01:00:36.960
Semi.

01:00:37.138 --> 01:00:39.402
For you or for him?

01:00:40.241 --> 01:00:43.233
You don't get to
interrogate me, Hardy.

01:00:44.245 --> 01:00:46.110
Know about the drugs?

01:00:47.615 --> 01:00:51.745
- Sorry, I gotta ask. Did you?
- No!

01:00:53.888 --> 01:00:56.379
Gotta put him in a
room, you know.

01:00:56.657 --> 01:00:57.988
Try and stop me.

01:00:58.559 --> 01:01:01.892
I need that consult report on the chart.
On the chart, okay?

01:01:02.062 --> 01:01:03.825
Yes, sir.

01:01:05.132 --> 01:01:09.626
Pike said the supplier was someone over
at the hospital. Guy named Vilmer.

01:01:09.837 --> 01:01:12.704
Well, shit, if it's on
tape, it's gotta be true.

01:01:12.873 --> 01:01:17.776
Piece of advice? Charming's not the
tack to take with us right now.

01:01:22.716 --> 01:01:24.877
I want a lawyer.

01:01:27.288 --> 01:01:28.619
No.

01:01:28.789 --> 01:01:30.654
Excuse me?

01:01:31.425 --> 01:01:33.620
No, you can't have a lawyer.

01:01:33.961 --> 01:01:36.395
Fuck you, Julie-bird.

01:01:36.564 --> 01:01:40.261
Uniform Code of Military
Justice says I get a lawyer.

01:01:40.434 --> 01:01:43.130
I don't have to say shit to you.

01:01:50.110 --> 01:01:51.543
How about them Yankees?

01:01:52.913 --> 01:01:57.577
Now, Peter, what I just did is illegal.
It'll kill my career in the Army.

01:01:57.751 --> 01:02:00.914
And that will end any chance
of going to law school...

01:02:01.088 --> 01:02:04.251
so I don't have
anything to lose.

01:02:05.593 --> 01:02:09.051
Now, do you really
want to go round two?

01:02:13.868 --> 01:02:17.531
Jesus Christ. What the fuck!

01:02:21.408 --> 01:02:24.571
I called them "combat
cocktails." Okay?

01:02:24.745 --> 01:02:28.374
I got them hooked, I had them push, once
they were in, they couldn't get out.

01:02:28.549 --> 01:02:30.210
It was a perfect goddamn crime.

01:02:30.384 --> 01:02:32.249
How'd you get around
the drug testing?

01:02:32.486 --> 01:02:34.818
Who do you think
administered the tests?

01:02:34.989 --> 01:02:38.447
I swapped their dirty piss
for someone else's clean.

01:02:38.626 --> 01:02:41.993
They could use all they wanted
and never pop positive.

01:02:42.162 --> 01:02:45.598
- Who else was involved?
- You broke my goddamn nose!

01:02:45.766 --> 01:02:48.291
Who else was involved?

01:02:49.537 --> 01:02:52.973
Mueller and that kid
who took a bullet.

01:02:55.175 --> 01:02:57.507
What, you didn't know that?

01:02:58.846 --> 01:03:00.245
How'd you recruit them?

01:03:01.282 --> 01:03:05.548
You know how it is in Panama, Tommy.
It's easy to spot the bad eggs.

01:03:05.753 --> 01:03:09.052
First week I snuck a couple of them
off base. Bought them some drinks...

01:03:09.223 --> 01:03:11.817
tried to find out which one
of them was interested.

01:03:12.026 --> 01:03:15.052
After that it was smooth. I
handled the cooking supplies...

01:03:15.229 --> 01:03:18.790
they handled distribution. That's it.
Broke my fucking nose.

01:03:19.099 --> 01:03:20.396
When did West find out?

01:03:21.368 --> 01:03:24.599
I didn't know he knew.
I just supply.

01:03:24.772 --> 01:03:27.138
I don't know shit about
what happened last night.

01:03:27.608 --> 01:03:29.838
That's real noble.
Thanks for clarifying.

01:03:31.211 --> 01:03:33.236
How long have you
been doing this?

01:03:33.681 --> 01:03:35.410
Gee, I wasn't looking
at my watch.

01:03:35.616 --> 01:03:40.110
- Were you doing this while we were...?
- While we were fucking? Yeah.

01:03:40.287 --> 01:03:42.482
Right under your nose.

01:03:42.656 --> 01:03:45.853
- Riggs?
- Yes, ma'am.

01:03:46.026 --> 01:03:48.017
Read this gentleman
his rights and...

01:03:48.228 --> 01:03:52.164
see to it that he gets medical
attention and stick him in a cell.

01:03:52.366 --> 01:03:54.266
Yes, ma'am.

01:03:55.636 --> 01:03:58.127
Nice seeing you again, Pete.

01:03:59.807 --> 01:04:04.176
Why would he risk 20 years in prison
just to sell a few painkillers?

01:04:04.345 --> 01:04:05.972
Doesn't add up.

01:04:06.146 --> 01:04:08.239
Kendall's the key.

01:04:09.049 --> 01:04:11.677
Ma'am, colonel's looking
for you and Mr. Hardy.

01:04:11.885 --> 01:04:14.046
Tell him we'll be right up.

01:04:15.022 --> 01:04:19.152
Now, look. How far do you
want to go with this?

01:04:20.494 --> 01:04:23.622
I think we should go see
Bill, hand over Vilmer...

01:04:23.797 --> 01:04:27.631
give him Dunbar's confession
and forget about Kendall.

01:04:27.835 --> 01:04:31.396
So Vilmer admitted to
supplying the drugs?

01:04:31.839 --> 01:04:33.238
Yes.

01:04:34.908 --> 01:04:36.705
- Christ.
- Now, look, Bill...

01:04:37.044 --> 01:04:40.172
you know, you got Vilmer's
confession, Dunbar's confession...

01:04:40.347 --> 01:04:42.975
that is more than enough
to clear you with CID.

01:04:43.183 --> 01:04:45.811
Great. Good. Good job, both of you.
Thanks.

01:04:45.986 --> 01:04:49.285
Thank you. All right. Then
we'll get out of here.

01:04:49.456 --> 01:04:51.924
There is one more thing, sir.

01:04:53.260 --> 01:04:55.820
Vilmer says Kendall was
involved in the drug scam.

01:04:56.030 --> 01:04:59.090
Captain, I don't
wanna hear this.

01:05:03.470 --> 01:05:09.375
Well, actually, Kendall did try
to burn Dunbar with us, so...

01:05:09.543 --> 01:05:11.568
that usually means
someone's involved.

01:05:13.847 --> 01:05:17.408
Captain Osborne, you are not
to go near Lieutenant Kendall.

01:05:17.584 --> 01:05:20.678
That's an order. Understood?

01:05:21.588 --> 01:05:23.556
Pike never admitted
shooting West.

01:05:24.625 --> 01:05:27.025
You tried to pin three
stone murders on Dunbar.

01:05:27.227 --> 01:05:29.092
Why don't you ask him
about the murders...

01:05:29.263 --> 01:05:31.060
he's covered up for
his drug dealer?

01:05:31.565 --> 01:05:34.227
Did it ever weigh on your
conscience or did you just...?

01:05:35.235 --> 01:05:38.068
Or do you just not
think about it?

01:05:41.275 --> 01:05:44.642
Running out of time! Ticktock,
ticktock, ticktock.

01:05:46.180 --> 01:05:50.617
Mueller shot Pike
point-blank in cold blood.

01:05:51.752 --> 01:05:53.242
I don't remember that at all.

01:05:53.420 --> 01:05:56.912
Don't get me wrong. Mueller was
perfectly capable of murder.

01:05:57.091 --> 01:06:00.652
He was the type of guy that you felt
uncomfortable going to sleep around.

01:06:01.495 --> 01:06:06.990
Why did you pin three murders on Dunbar?
The man saved your life.

01:06:07.367 --> 01:06:12.395
Oh, so I should cover
up for his misdeeds?

01:06:13.307 --> 01:06:17.505
- What? I was just telling you the truth.
- Not according to Pete Vilmer.

01:06:19.513 --> 01:06:22.073
Vilmer. Vilmer.

01:06:22.282 --> 01:06:24.273
Vilmer, Vilmer, Vilmer.

01:06:24.451 --> 01:06:28.046
Vilmer. Is that what you
think you have on me?

01:06:28.222 --> 01:06:32.625
It's his drug-peddling word against mine.
You have to do better than that.

01:06:32.826 --> 01:06:34.191
You guys are on drugs.

01:06:36.163 --> 01:06:38.631
- They got their story straight.
- What do you mean?

01:06:38.799 --> 01:06:42.166
What Kendall's saying about "the type
of guy you feel uncomfortable..."

01:06:42.336 --> 01:06:45.271
sleeping next to"? That's what
Dunbar said about Mueller.

01:06:45.439 --> 01:06:48.738
Hardy, they planned this.

01:06:50.844 --> 01:06:53.506
Not bad for hostile
and uncooperative.

01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:57.081
- You're running out of time now!
- You and Dunbar got your story straight.

01:06:57.251 --> 01:07:00.186
You two just kept bouncing us
back and forth, trying to...

01:07:00.354 --> 01:07:03.846
figure out the differences, killing
time till transport can whisk you away.

01:07:04.057 --> 01:07:06.389
You're accessory to murder,
you understand that?

01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:08.152
You're going to jail.
Right, Hardy?

01:07:08.328 --> 01:07:11.491
- If he's lucky.
- You know what? You're full of shit.

01:07:11.698 --> 01:07:13.495
You are fucking full of shit.

01:07:17.604 --> 01:07:20.164
What, you scared, Levi? Is
that why you're laughing?

01:07:20.374 --> 01:07:23.537
You think we got nothing on you?
That doesn't matter, Levi.

01:07:23.744 --> 01:07:26.269
No, it doesn't. Know why? We'll
find one of those bodies...

01:07:26.446 --> 01:07:29.813
and I'm gonna make sure it has a
bullet in it that matches your weapon.

01:07:29.983 --> 01:07:32.816
I'm just gonna get your pistol,
take it to the morgue...

01:07:33.020 --> 01:07:34.749
shoot it into one
of their skulls.

01:07:35.689 --> 01:07:38.249
What's going on? What's happening?
Kendall?

01:07:39.493 --> 01:07:41.358
Nurse!

01:07:41.895 --> 01:07:44.659
Get in here, get in here!

01:07:45.866 --> 01:07:48.164
What happened? Suction!
Give me suction!

01:07:51.538 --> 01:07:54.166
- Get that tube in there!
- Hold him!

01:08:06.753 --> 01:08:08.118
Captain Osborne?

01:08:08.522 --> 01:08:09.716
Sir.

01:08:09.890 --> 01:08:12.654
You're relieved of your
duties until further notice.

01:08:12.893 --> 01:08:15.418
- Yes, sir.
- You'll be lucky if I don't put you in...

01:08:15.596 --> 01:08:17.154
for a court-martial.

01:08:18.698 --> 01:08:21.725
- He was dirty, Bill.
- He's dead, Tom!

01:08:21.902 --> 01:08:24.200
And don't think you're
not on my shit-list too.

01:08:25.037 --> 01:08:28.939
We found the bunker. It was demolished,
like they said. No bodies.

01:08:29.609 --> 01:08:33.011
Come on, a hurricane like that could've
blown them three counties away.

01:08:33.180 --> 01:08:34.772
What happens to Dunbar now?

01:08:35.515 --> 01:08:39.006
In 10 minutes he gets on a
plane, which means you're done.

01:08:39.185 --> 01:08:42.121
You'll understand if I
don't walk you out.

01:08:45.926 --> 01:08:48.759
- Strange kid.
- What?

01:08:48.929 --> 01:08:50.863
Kendall.

01:08:51.031 --> 01:08:54.761
Even while he was dying he was
making jokes about infinity.

01:09:04.411 --> 01:09:05.673
What?

01:09:12.252 --> 01:09:14.015
What?

01:09:15.788 --> 01:09:18.986
Dunbar wrote this when
he asked for a Ranger.

01:09:19.158 --> 01:09:20.751
There's an 8 on it.

01:09:30.404 --> 01:09:31.803
I don't know.

01:09:32.572 --> 01:09:34.301
Okay.

01:09:35.042 --> 01:09:37.237
I'll find out by myself.

01:09:37.411 --> 01:09:39.242
Stop.

01:09:42.916 --> 01:09:44.747
Okay.

01:09:50.490 --> 01:09:50.590
Any spooks involved here?
CIA? FBI?

01:09:50.591 --> 01:09:53.889
Any spooks involved here?
CIA? FBI?

01:09:54.461 --> 01:09:55.894
Not exactly.

01:09:56.296 --> 01:10:00.289
- What's that mean?
- There was a group of guys down here...

01:10:02.369 --> 01:10:05.964
There was a group of guys down here
who were way out on the hairy edge.

01:10:06.139 --> 01:10:08.699
They did covert
stuff and they...

01:10:09.376 --> 01:10:12.209
They what?

01:10:12.379 --> 01:10:15.473
They went rogue.
They went renegade.

01:10:15.649 --> 01:10:18.709
Dropped off the face of the earth,
disappeared into drug land...

01:10:18.885 --> 01:10:23.686
and with their special skills cut one
hell of a swath through the competition.

01:10:23.857 --> 01:10:27.020
West trained some of these guys.

01:10:27.194 --> 01:10:30.027
And he hated them for what
they did, and they hated him.

01:10:30.597 --> 01:10:33.691
- That could be what this is about.
- Who knows about this?

01:10:33.867 --> 01:10:36.529
How do I know? They're ghosts, right?
They're dead.

01:10:36.703 --> 01:10:40.036
This could all be a story.
None of this could be true.

01:10:40.607 --> 01:10:44.941
But the note that
that kid wrote...

01:10:45.112 --> 01:10:46.875
had an 8 on it.

01:10:47.948 --> 01:10:50.416
And that's what this
outfit called themselves.

01:10:51.618 --> 01:10:53.586
Section 8.

01:10:53.787 --> 01:10:57.723
Section 8? You mean,
like, they're crazy?

01:11:01.228 --> 01:11:05.562
- How could you keep that from me?
- Classified.

01:11:09.169 --> 01:11:14.368
You son of a bitch! Mister,
I've had it with you!

01:11:17.844 --> 01:11:20.074
Okay, so are you happy?

01:11:33.894 --> 01:11:35.555
Is that a no?

01:11:42.836 --> 01:11:46.237
Ma'am. Need your signature
for this guy's transport.

01:11:46.406 --> 01:11:47.896
Sure thing.

01:11:48.141 --> 01:11:50.268
What the hell
happened to you two?

01:11:50.477 --> 01:11:54.436
None of your business. Kendall's
dead and you're going to jail.

01:11:54.614 --> 01:11:56.479
CID's here to take
you to Washington.

01:11:56.716 --> 01:12:01.676
Guess I'm on the same transport as Pike.
Hey, Julie-bird, you bitch...

01:12:02.089 --> 01:12:05.183
why don't you go on and get me
something to eat? I'm starving.

01:12:05.358 --> 01:12:08.759
- What did you say?
- I didn't mean to call her a bitch.

01:12:08.929 --> 01:12:11.329
No, no, no, before.
What did you say?

01:12:12.799 --> 01:12:17.293
What, that me and Pike were on a
transport plane going to D.C. together?

01:12:18.438 --> 01:12:19.962
You mean Dunbar.

01:12:21.007 --> 01:12:24.306
No, Pike.

01:12:25.612 --> 01:12:29.275
The one that they just
hauled out of here.

01:12:29.449 --> 01:12:33.476
The guy that they brought in
with Kendall on the chopper.

01:12:33.687 --> 01:12:35.120
That was Dunbar.

01:12:35.655 --> 01:12:39.113
No. That's not right.

01:12:39.326 --> 01:12:41.817
What do you mean? Why not?

01:12:42.129 --> 01:12:43.926
Tom...

01:12:44.564 --> 01:12:46.828
Ray Dunbar is black.

01:13:09.523 --> 01:13:11.582
Son of a bitch did
the whole thing!

01:13:11.791 --> 01:13:14.111
Files don't show race. All he
had to do is switch dog tags.

01:13:14.127 --> 01:13:16.220
- Where's this transport going from?
- Hangar Four.

01:13:16.429 --> 01:13:19.921
Move it. Come on, go!
Go! Go! Go!

01:13:41.121 --> 01:13:42.816
- Sir!
- We got company, sir.

01:13:42.989 --> 01:13:45.856
- I need to talk to your prisoner right now!
- What, captain?

01:13:46.059 --> 01:13:49.460
- I need to take him back for questioning...
- We're not finished with you yet, Pike.

01:13:49.629 --> 01:13:51.529
- Wanna bet?
- Let go!

01:13:51.731 --> 01:13:54.291
Hey! Hardy, what the
fuck are you doing?

01:13:55.135 --> 01:13:56.762
Gun!

01:13:57.971 --> 01:14:01.771
- Sir! We have tried to...
- Come on down, Pike, come on down!

01:14:02.909 --> 01:14:07.039
You wanna talk baseball now?
I don't think so!

01:14:08.949 --> 01:14:12.248
You don't have any bodies yet!
What are you gonna do?

01:14:12.419 --> 01:14:15.479
- You're not gonna shoot me!
- You see what happens when you lie?

01:14:15.655 --> 01:14:18.590
What do you got?! You got nothing on me!
You got...

01:14:27.434 --> 01:14:29.800
Hardy, what are you doing, man?
Stop that!

01:14:29.970 --> 01:14:32.734
- Let him go!
- Stand down!

01:14:32.939 --> 01:14:36.340
Tom, what the fuck are you doing?!
Stand down, goddamn it!

01:14:56.863 --> 01:14:58.524
Shut up!

01:15:04.437 --> 01:15:08.931
Well, well, well. What
have we got here?

01:15:09.643 --> 01:15:11.736
I told you he knows.

01:15:11.911 --> 01:15:14.038
Now, wait. Knows what?

01:15:14.214 --> 01:15:15.841
About the other operation.

01:15:16.750 --> 01:15:18.615
What other operation?

01:15:18.785 --> 01:15:20.343
The coke.

01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:24.388
They were sending pounds of it back to
the States, using military supply lines.

01:15:24.758 --> 01:15:29.024
Vilmer would hide it in crates of files.
Hell, he'd ship it in a corpse if he had to.

01:15:29.696 --> 01:15:34.156
West figured it out about a week ago.
He was gonna go to the colonel.

01:15:35.835 --> 01:15:39.396
Kendall and Mueller must've decided
to take him out of the equation.

01:15:39.606 --> 01:15:43.838
You have got to be the dumbest bunch of
sons of bitches on God's green earth.

01:15:44.044 --> 01:15:46.535
You think you can ship that
shit right under my nose?

01:15:49.182 --> 01:15:51.742
Mueller, what are you doing?!

01:15:53.153 --> 01:15:54.415
Get his weapon.

01:15:55.355 --> 01:15:56.379
Castro, wait!

01:15:56.990 --> 01:15:58.480
Castro!

01:16:00.260 --> 01:16:01.740
- Put it down.
- Fuck you, let him go!

01:16:01.895 --> 01:16:04.386
This ain't some drive-by! You think
you can kill a man face to face?

01:16:04.564 --> 01:16:06.998
- Put it down, Pike!
- He'll fucking shoot you!

01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:11.728
I am your objective, right? You fire, I
fire. You're down to four. Well, three.

01:16:11.905 --> 01:16:15.102
You can't trust him. Maybe I'll take one
or two more of you before you take me.

01:16:15.275 --> 01:16:19.871
The odds are in your favor that at least
two of you walk out of here alive.

01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:24.244
Conversely, there's absolutely no way I
should be able to walk out of this bunker.

01:16:34.794 --> 01:16:37.592
This is bullshit! I'll do it!

01:16:47.807 --> 01:16:50.002
So pretty.

01:16:51.978 --> 01:16:53.411
So dead.

01:17:15.835 --> 01:17:19.134
Kendall, what are you doing?
Kendall!

01:17:22.876 --> 01:17:25.572
What, you don't believe me?

01:17:28.848 --> 01:17:34.878
Medical crate 8469846 in
Shipping D awaiting transfer.

01:17:35.054 --> 01:17:37.181
See for yourself.

01:17:43.797 --> 01:17:47.164
Vilmer and whoever his partner was
must have been making millions.

01:17:49.269 --> 01:17:51.567
Where did the coke come from?

01:17:51.738 --> 01:17:54.002
Fuck if I know. I
mean, this is Panama.

01:17:54.174 --> 01:17:57.439
Throw a rock in any direction,
you'll hit three cartels.

01:17:57.744 --> 01:18:01.646
About an hour later, Kendall
and I found Dunbar.

01:18:21.334 --> 01:18:23.996
Put it down! Put it down, son.

01:18:24.604 --> 01:18:28.631
- I just wanna go!
- Understandable. Now, put it down.

01:18:29.375 --> 01:18:32.902
- Look, I never meant to hurt anybody!
- Let's keep it that way!

01:18:33.079 --> 01:18:34.979
You surrender, I take you in.

01:18:35.782 --> 01:18:38.478
I know it sounds like a shitty
deal, but you get to live.

01:18:38.685 --> 01:18:42.177
I'll go my way, and
you go yours, okay?

01:18:42.355 --> 01:18:47.554
Not gonna happen! You either
surrender or we die where we stand.

01:18:47.727 --> 01:18:49.922
- So, what's it gonna be?
- Sarge!

01:19:02.876 --> 01:19:07.438
I knew if sarge died they'd blame me.
That's why I took Dunbar's dog tags.

01:19:11.985 --> 01:19:13.976
Oh, God! Oh! Oh, God!

01:19:14.153 --> 01:19:18.112
Mueller didn't die after all.
Came after us with a vengeance.

01:19:18.791 --> 01:19:21.089
You know the rest.

01:19:21.728 --> 01:19:25.095
How'd you get Kendall to go along
with switching Dunbar's dog tags?

01:19:25.265 --> 01:19:29.759
I gave him a choice. Either go along
or I drop a dime on his drug scam.

01:19:32.205 --> 01:19:34.196
How about the bodies?

01:19:34.641 --> 01:19:38.008
That hurricane almost
lifted me off the ground.

01:19:38.278 --> 01:19:39.939
But they're out there.

01:19:46.352 --> 01:19:48.616
It's there, just like you said.

01:19:50.323 --> 01:19:52.257
So you'll testify
to all of this?

01:19:53.359 --> 01:19:55.623
I don't think you're
gonna get any deals.

01:19:56.162 --> 01:19:58.722
I don't want any deals.

01:19:59.499 --> 01:20:02.127
I'll take him now,
if you don't mind.

01:20:10.109 --> 01:20:13.510
We should've died out
there with the others.

01:20:14.213 --> 01:20:16.010
Did you get what you wanted?

01:20:16.215 --> 01:20:18.547
Not even close.

01:20:38.004 --> 01:20:40.632
Just that one thing that I
wanted to ask you about.

01:20:40.807 --> 01:20:43.435
- Say when.
- Yeah, this is Hardy.

01:20:43.610 --> 01:20:45.407
Oh, really?

01:20:46.279 --> 01:20:48.804
Okay. Thank you.

01:20:49.649 --> 01:20:53.483
The kid said that West waited till the
end of the week to tell the colonel.

01:20:53.653 --> 01:20:58.283
Now, why would he wait until the
end of the week to tell you?

01:20:58.458 --> 01:21:01.894
I mean, that doesn't sound
like the West that we knew.

01:21:02.695 --> 01:21:05.061
You think the kid was lying?

01:21:06.833 --> 01:21:09.802
No. I don't.

01:21:11.104 --> 01:21:13.004
- I think you are.
- What?

01:21:13.172 --> 01:21:16.767
I do. I think you're lying.
I do.

01:21:16.943 --> 01:21:18.240
I think that...

01:21:18.478 --> 01:21:20.571
- I think that West came to you...
- And?

01:21:20.780 --> 01:21:22.873
And you told Mueller and
Kendall to kill him.

01:21:26.619 --> 01:21:28.883
Then what did I do, go
and poison Kendall?

01:21:29.155 --> 01:21:32.352
- Well, who said he was poisoned?
- What?

01:21:32.558 --> 01:21:35.789
I just found out. The hospital
found out three minutes ago.

01:21:35.962 --> 01:21:40.365
- I was on the phone with the pathologist.
- Golly, Tom, the kid was puking blood...

01:21:40.533 --> 01:21:42.296
all over the hospital.

01:21:42.468 --> 01:21:45.494
You know, gunshot and childbirth
just didn't seem to fit...

01:21:45.672 --> 01:21:49.369
so I took a wild-ass
fucking guess.

01:21:52.812 --> 01:21:55.679
Was that really the pathologist?

01:21:55.848 --> 01:21:58.043
No, that was my message service.

01:21:58.217 --> 01:22:01.618
Even if it was, does
that prove anything?

01:22:02.255 --> 01:22:04.985
You keep forgetting...

01:22:05.158 --> 01:22:06.420
I don't have to.

01:22:07.593 --> 01:22:10.960
- What?
- I don't have to prove anything...

01:22:11.130 --> 01:22:15.692
- because it's not my job.
- I mean, golly, Tom...

01:22:16.469 --> 01:22:18.437
I just have to get you
to the real guys.

01:22:21.541 --> 01:22:23.065
One-third.

01:22:30.316 --> 01:22:31.613
Come on, Tom.

01:22:32.852 --> 01:22:35.252
You've never met a
bribe you didn't like.

01:22:35.421 --> 01:22:38.584
Oh, I see. I see.

01:22:38.758 --> 01:22:42.387
You called me so in case I
stumbled upon something...

01:22:42.595 --> 01:22:43.994
you'd just buy me off.

01:22:45.498 --> 01:22:47.489
Crossed my mind.

01:22:49.535 --> 01:22:52.402
Like I said, they were never
gonna make me a general anyway.

01:22:52.572 --> 01:22:54.597
This is about quality of life.

01:22:56.042 --> 01:22:59.478
Tom, you've had a hell of a run of
bad luck. Bounced out of the Army...

01:22:59.645 --> 01:23:03.604
hanging by a thread at the DEA. You're
gonna wind up a fucking process server.

01:23:03.783 --> 01:23:08.345
If you lose enough times,
what you are is a loser.

01:23:08.554 --> 01:23:11.751
Why don't you cut yourself a break,
for chrissake? Forty percent.

01:23:11.924 --> 01:23:14.256
Once I'm up and running again.

01:23:14.627 --> 01:23:16.424
Up and running again?

01:23:17.130 --> 01:23:19.530
This is just a hiccup.

01:23:19.699 --> 01:23:23.294
I can get another three, four months
before they close the place down.

01:23:34.514 --> 01:23:36.448
I'll have to think about that.

01:23:55.601 --> 01:23:59.537
And then I saw the gun
and then he drew it...

01:23:59.705 --> 01:24:03.402
so I had no choice but to fire.

01:24:03.576 --> 01:24:06.340
How many rounds did
you fire, captain?

01:24:07.480 --> 01:24:10.813
- Two. Three, maybe.
- Okay.

01:24:10.983 --> 01:24:14.043
All right, ma'am. Thank you.

01:24:24.897 --> 01:24:26.831
Thanks.

01:24:27.266 --> 01:24:29.166
Now what?

01:24:29.936 --> 01:24:34.805
I'm gonna go home and get drunk
and try to forget all of this.

01:24:34.974 --> 01:24:37.169
Well, in that case...

01:24:37.877 --> 01:24:39.936
there you go.

01:24:41.914 --> 01:24:43.211
Your phone number?

01:24:43.416 --> 01:24:46.817
Yeah, I thought maybe later I'd
slip by and we'd do the old...

01:24:49.288 --> 01:24:53.554
It's just in case you need me
to testify about the shooting.

01:24:54.060 --> 01:24:57.086
But you don't worry,
they'll clear you on that.

01:24:57.263 --> 01:24:59.390
He was your friend.

01:24:59.565 --> 01:25:01.692
Yeah, but he was a lot
of other things too.

01:25:01.868 --> 01:25:04.860
Besides, my friends don't
betray their country.

01:25:14.013 --> 01:25:15.947
Tuesday?

01:25:16.816 --> 01:25:18.647
Tuesday, pick me up at 7?

01:25:19.452 --> 01:25:23.252
Tuesday at 7. You're one
of the good ones, Osborne.

01:25:23.422 --> 01:25:25.720
I don't want you to worry
about what happened.

01:25:25.892 --> 01:25:28.884
All we gotta do is
tell the story right.

01:25:43.576 --> 01:25:46.136
All we gotta do is
tell the story right.

01:25:52.084 --> 01:25:56.987
And we can be the men that took
down our sergeant's killers.

01:25:57.156 --> 01:26:00.614
All we gotta do is
tell the story...

01:26:00.826 --> 01:26:03.818
- T ell the story right.
- T ell the story right.

01:27:15.234 --> 01:27:16.861
Friends in low places.

01:27:19.105 --> 01:27:21.335
The murders he's covered
up for his drug dealer?

01:27:23.376 --> 01:27:25.071
Wasn't even his real name.

01:27:25.978 --> 01:27:28.105
Pike wasn't even his real...

01:27:28.314 --> 01:27:30.874
They're dead, right?
They're ghosts.

01:27:37.890 --> 01:27:40.859
West trained some of these guys.
And they hated him.

01:27:44.597 --> 01:27:46.360
I wanted him dead...
I wanted him dead...

01:27:48.167 --> 01:27:49.600
I am your objective, right?

01:30:02.868 --> 01:30:04.165
Osborne?

01:30:05.771 --> 01:30:08.001
If you don't like the
music, just say so.

01:30:08.541 --> 01:30:13.672
Don't move. Put your
hands on the table. Now.

01:30:14.046 --> 01:30:15.604
Who are they?

01:30:15.781 --> 01:30:20.445
They are my colleagues. And they're
discussing breakfast recipes.

01:30:21.620 --> 01:30:24.646
- You knew about the coke.
- Yes, I did.

01:30:24.823 --> 01:30:26.882
You knew about Vilmer.

01:30:28.127 --> 01:30:30.357
You knew about Styles.

01:30:31.597 --> 01:30:35.328
In fact, they work for you,
because you're Section 8.

01:30:35.501 --> 01:30:39.437
You planned all this.
And you killed West.

01:30:40.539 --> 01:30:44.635
Give me one good reason why I should not
fucking blow your head off right now.

01:30:47.112 --> 01:30:48.875
Tom?

01:30:49.882 --> 01:30:52.908
Why did this young woman have a
weapon pointed at your head?

01:30:53.118 --> 01:30:56.576
This is Captain Osborne, and
she has had a long day.

01:30:56.755 --> 01:30:59.383
Oh, I'll bet it was
something you said.

01:30:59.592 --> 01:31:01.992
She thinks I killed you.

01:31:02.895 --> 01:31:04.328
He didn't.

01:31:04.530 --> 01:31:06.157
I thought you hated each other.

01:31:06.365 --> 01:31:10.165
I'm not particularly fond of him, and he
is sort of a jerk, but what can you do?

01:31:10.369 --> 01:31:12.701
- Will you cut me some slack?
- Slack?

01:31:12.871 --> 01:31:14.862
Did he say "slack"?

01:31:15.040 --> 01:31:18.567
Captain. Sit, it's safe. You
wanna talk about slack?

01:31:19.178 --> 01:31:22.375
You take a simple find-out-
who's-working-for-who operation...

01:31:22.548 --> 01:31:26.245
next thing I know, there's corpses
flopping around like it's raining fish.

01:31:26.452 --> 01:31:28.511
- Yeah, but I rescued your ass.
- Rescued my...?

01:31:28.687 --> 01:31:31.383
- Did my ass need rescuing?
- Don't put me in this.

01:31:31.557 --> 01:31:33.252
You stumble upon a
drug operation...

01:31:33.425 --> 01:31:35.518
in the middle of 10,000
heavily armed men...

01:31:35.694 --> 01:31:37.662
and you didn't have
to be pulled out?

01:31:37.863 --> 01:31:41.321
See now, that's different. I was
going to retire early anyway.

01:31:41.567 --> 01:31:45.765
So you found out about the
coke and you told Styles?

01:31:45.938 --> 01:31:47.303
Yeah, who did nothing.

01:31:47.506 --> 01:31:50.202
Except order Kendall and
Mueller to kill you.

01:31:50.509 --> 01:31:53.239
And you figured that they were
gonna do it in the jungle.

01:31:53.412 --> 01:31:55.710
That's why I called this genius.

01:31:55.914 --> 01:31:59.975
Breakfast is ready! Do you remember
the triplets? Raul's daughters?

01:32:00.152 --> 01:32:03.121
- This is hotter.
- This might eat me!

01:32:04.690 --> 01:32:06.157
Captain.

01:32:06.425 --> 01:32:09.121
Dunbar. Or is it Pike?

01:32:09.495 --> 01:32:12.055
- Oh, actually it's neither, ma'am.
- Right.

01:32:13.098 --> 01:32:17.467
- So you're not Nunez.
- No, ma'am. I'm afraid I'm not.

01:32:17.636 --> 01:32:21.834
Right. Because none of y'all exist.
You're all dead.

01:32:22.007 --> 01:32:26.535
Well, you could refer to it as
bureaucratic absence of presence.

01:32:26.712 --> 01:32:29.408
I mean, we're here.
But we're not here.

01:32:29.581 --> 01:32:34.041
Now, he would be dead in the ground if
you hadn't saved his ass. I mean dead.

01:32:34.219 --> 01:32:35.686
You are on it today!

01:32:35.888 --> 01:32:37.583
What are you laughing at?

01:32:37.756 --> 01:32:40.247
The idea that you just
transferred into his unit.

01:32:40.426 --> 01:32:43.156
Negative. I just transferred
to Arlington Cemetery.

01:32:43.329 --> 01:32:45.923
You keep talking shit and you're
liable to make roll call.

01:32:47.433 --> 01:32:51.130
- So you're all Section 8?
- I told you she was smart.

01:32:51.303 --> 01:32:54.363
No, you said she was...
What did he say she was?

01:32:54.540 --> 01:32:56.474
- Hot.
- Hot.

01:32:58.410 --> 01:33:00.503
Yes, ma'am. We're
officially Section 8.

01:33:00.779 --> 01:33:03.339
And what about the story
about you guys being all...

01:33:03.515 --> 01:33:06.541
- renegade drug dealers and stuff?
- More like ragamuffins.

01:33:06.719 --> 01:33:09.586
That's been our unit's cover story
since the beginning, ma'am.

01:33:09.755 --> 01:33:13.748
And it's a story that scares the
frijoles out of the Colombians.

01:33:15.661 --> 01:33:18.994
Okay, so now that I know
all this, what happens?

01:33:19.164 --> 01:33:23.294
I get a needle in my arm and wake
up tomorrow morning with no memory?

01:33:23.569 --> 01:33:26.231
Isn't that what you guys do?

01:33:26.472 --> 01:33:30.135
We actually thought you handled
yourself quite well in this situation.

01:33:32.144 --> 01:33:34.669
We were gonna offer you a job.

01:33:36.348 --> 01:33:38.873
Did she tell you the story
about the carnival last night?

01:33:39.084 --> 01:33:40.984
- Oh, don't start.
- Shit.

01:33:41.186 --> 01:33:44.019
- What do you want to know?
- Miss Festival Party Lady.

01:33:44.189 --> 01:33:45.349
What do you wanna know?

01:33:45.524 --> 01:33:48.084
Don't act like you weren't
all over this man.

01:33:48.260 --> 01:33:50.558
Yeah, tell him the truth.

01:33:52.698 --> 01:33:56.327
So, what are you gonna do?

01:33:58.771 --> 01:34:00.466
I think I need a beer.

01:34:02.374 --> 01:34:04.274
Here you go, colonel.

01:34:04.743 --> 01:34:06.074
Colonel?

01:34:06.174 --> 01:34:11.174
