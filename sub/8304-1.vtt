00:36.440 --> 00:40.000
... full sum and total of the F.B.I.
And the police department's efforts here.

00:40.120 --> 00:43.520
As has been outlined before,
a couple of hundred...

00:43.600 --> 00:47.240
M-Mafia and organized crime members
and associates have been indicted...

00:47.320 --> 00:49.480
in the last year to two years.

00:49.560 --> 00:53.480
So that the attack is at the top level,
the middle level and the lower level.

00:53.560 --> 00:57.960
And we are doing everything that
we can to identify, indict and convict...

00:58.040 --> 01:01.720
the capos, the soldiers and
the associates of the Mafia as well.

01:12.920 --> 01:17.200
Look, I gotta clip a guy.
All I'm carrying is a.22.

01:19.280 --> 01:21.200
Of course I know
it's not worth a shit.

01:21.280 --> 01:23.680
What the fuck do you think
I'm calling you for?

01:23.760 --> 01:27.680
Go fuck yourself!

01:30.520 --> 01:33.320
- Hey, Tony.
- Hey.

01:33.400 --> 01:35.520
Your, uh, your papa here?

01:35.600 --> 01:41.120
Uh, yeah. He's upstairs, but he's sleepin'.
I'm makin' a banana daiquiri. You want one?

01:41.200 --> 01:44.400
Asshole.

02:33.160 --> 02:36.040
My God! Cousin, what are you-

02:39.840 --> 02:43.040
What are you doin', Coz. I love you.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.240
Coz, why are you doing this?

02:57.280 --> 02:59.200
Pop!

03:01.280 --> 03:03.200
Pop?

03:06.280 --> 03:08.400
Papa! Pop!

03:08.480 --> 03:11.480
Pop!

03:15.120 --> 03:17.680
You're not being
very helpful, Jackie.

03:17.760 --> 03:19.800
I'm gonna have to let
your parole officer know.

03:22.200 --> 03:24.240
Come on, Jackie.
We're not morons.

03:24.360 --> 03:27.120
You had your eyes shut the whole time?
You fuckin' expect us to believe that?

03:27.155 --> 03:29.080
I'm sorry, miss.

03:29.200 --> 03:32.000
My eyes were shut the whole time.

03:32.080 --> 03:35.360
I never saw nothin'.

03:35.440 --> 03:39.540
- Miss?
- My eyes were shut the whole time.

03:39.575 --> 03:43.640
Yeah. All right, Manny.
Let's get out of here.

03:43.720 --> 03:47.720
Hey. Someone sneaks in and pops you,
don't come complainin' to us.

03:47.800 --> 03:51.360
If somebody pops me,
I won't go complainin' to nobody.

04:10.680 --> 04:13.400
Hey, Pop.
You sure you're doin' the right thing?

04:13.480 --> 04:18.320
- I mean, I feel like killing this motherfucker myself.
- Hey, watch your language.

04:18.399 --> 04:21.120
- And you don't rat out the people that love you.
- Love you?

04:21.200 --> 04:24.120
He's your cousin. He puts four fuckin'
bullets in you, and he loves you?

04:24.155 --> 04:26.720
Yeah, he loves me. I love him.

04:26.800 --> 04:31.160
He's family. He's just a junkie.
He doesn't know what he's doing.

04:31.280 --> 04:35.440
Live and let live. Speaking of which,
how many times I gotta tell you?

04:35.560 --> 04:39.480
If you see me shot 20 times, if you
come in the room I got my head cut off...

04:39.600 --> 04:43.160
- you don't call the cops.
- I know, Pop.

04:43.195 --> 04:47.040
- Who do you call?
- I call Saul.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.920
That's right.
Come here.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.240
My fuckin' hand.
This fuckin' cousin of mine.

04:52.320 --> 04:54.240
I swear to God,
I feel like killin' him.

04:56.680 --> 04:59.120
- Can they do that?
- Do what?

04:59.200 --> 05:02.120
- Go to my parole officer and get my bail revoked.
- Hell, no.

05:02.200 --> 05:04.520
You didn't shoot nobody.
Somebody shot you.

05:04.640 --> 05:08.920
- That trial ever gonna happen?
It's been a year already.
- They got no case.

05:09.040 --> 05:10.960
That's why they
charge you under RICO.

05:11.040 --> 05:13.760
Whenever the government has no case,
they charge you under RICO.

05:13.840 --> 05:16.280
Aw, fuck them.

05:19.720 --> 05:22.280
We gonna order some room service?

05:24.960 --> 05:27.080
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, this looks great.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.080
- Muchas gracias.
- Gracias.

05:29.160 --> 05:31.080
- Good evening.
- Stay where you are. Nice and easy, gentlemen.

05:31.160 --> 05:33.160
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say...

05:33.240 --> 05:35.240
can and will be held against you
in a court of law.

05:35.320 --> 05:37.360
Do you understand that right?

05:37.480 --> 05:39.400
You have the right to an attorney.

05:39.480 --> 05:43.240
If you can't afford one, the court will
appoint you one. Do you understand that right?

05:43.320 --> 05:47.680
Mr. DiNorscio. Mr. DiNorscio!

05:47.760 --> 05:49.680
Mr. Rizzo, would you
wake your client up?

05:54.800 --> 05:57.080
Twenty-two to 30 years...

05:57.160 --> 06:00.240
for possession, sale and
distribution of narcotics.

06:00.320 --> 06:04.800
And believe me, I'll try to see to it
that you do the full 30 years.

06:14.960 --> 06:16.965
Let's go, Jackie.

06:17.000 --> 06:21.040
Jesus, Sylvester.
A little privacy, please.

06:21.120 --> 06:25.080
- Come on, Jackie Dee. You're going downtown.
- For what?

06:25.160 --> 06:27.480
Damned if I know, but I'm sure as hell
I'm not standing here...

06:27.560 --> 06:30.160
smelling your shit
while I argue with you.

06:31.880 --> 06:34.680
- Let's go.
- Coming.

06:38.480 --> 06:42.080
Sylvester, how long
we known each other?

06:42.160 --> 06:44.600
On and off, uh, maybe eight years.

06:44.720 --> 06:47.160
I'm a good guy, right?

06:47.280 --> 06:49.200
Right.

06:50.200 --> 06:53.320
- Everybody loves me.
- Right.

06:53.400 --> 06:57.400
So why are you standing here bustin' my balls?
You can't let me finish takin' a crap?

06:57.480 --> 07:02.280
You know, you're so full of it, you could
sit on that toilet forever. Let's go.

07:05.080 --> 07:07.360
So where you guys taking me anyway?

07:07.440 --> 07:10.200
Federal building.

07:10.280 --> 07:13.000
For what?

07:13.080 --> 07:15.880
I have no idea.

07:15.960 --> 07:18.600
Hey, could you do me a favor,
roll down the window?

07:18.720 --> 07:20.800
It's too cold.

07:24.280 --> 07:26.800
Geez.

07:31.720 --> 07:33.640
Thanks, fellas.

07:44.640 --> 07:49.840
Wow, you guys expecting the
U.S. Attorney for the Southern District?

07:49.920 --> 07:52.320
Giuliani said to start without him.

07:53.920 --> 07:55.840
Okay.

08:00.880 --> 08:04.120
- You got any ketchup?
- Oh, sorry. Just A-1 sauce.

08:04.200 --> 08:07.080
A-1 sauce? A steak
should have ketchup.

08:08.720 --> 08:11.520
- Please.
- All right.

08:16.120 --> 08:18.320
- Ah, shrimp cocktail.
- Mm-hmm.

08:18.400 --> 08:21.400
- A little wine?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

08:24.120 --> 08:26.920
So, car ride okay?

08:27.000 --> 08:28.920
The car ride?

08:29.000 --> 08:31.800
Oh, yeah, the fresh air felt good.

08:31.880 --> 08:35.559
- The guys was real nice.
They lowered the window for me.
- Mm.

08:35.640 --> 08:37.559
Well, I hope you
breathed nice and deep.

08:37.640 --> 08:40.720
It could be your last
fresh air for 30 years.

08:40.799 --> 08:44.000
Yeah, that judge shoved it right up my ass.
Can you believe that?

08:44.080 --> 08:46.280
Doesn't have to be.

08:48.800 --> 08:50.720
What doesn't have to be?

08:53.040 --> 08:55.240
Thirty years.

08:59.080 --> 09:02.360
- Got any more wine?
- Sure.

09:04.400 --> 09:06.920
By the way, do you want
your lawyer here?

09:08.920 --> 09:10.960
My lawyer?

09:11.040 --> 09:14.520
I just got sentenced to 30 years
for a pissant dope deal...

09:14.600 --> 09:16.680
'cause of that cocksucker.

09:18.840 --> 09:20.760
So what do youse want?

09:22.200 --> 09:24.520
You know what this is, Jackie?

09:27.120 --> 09:29.040
Manhattan phone book?

09:32.280 --> 09:34.400
Last year, you got indicted.

09:34.520 --> 09:36.880
Fourteen counts.

09:36.960 --> 09:42.840
"Gambling, racketeering,
narcotics distribution, conspiracy-"

09:42.920 --> 09:45.120
That RICO thing?
That's a year old.

09:45.200 --> 09:47.720
Counselor,
I completely forgot about it.

09:47.800 --> 09:49.920
I mean, it's been so long.

09:50.000 --> 09:54.920
And... everybody knows that those
RICO things are bullshit anyway, so-

09:55.000 --> 09:57.360
Yeah, well, this one isn't bullshit.

09:57.440 --> 10:02.680
It's not just you. Your boss,
your underboss, and 17 of your goombahs.

10:02.760 --> 10:07.920
Twenty of you on 76 counts.
We're not fucking around, Jackie.

10:08.040 --> 10:11.320
Mm-hmm.
So what do you need me for?

10:11.400 --> 10:14.720
You're all going down.
You are all going down.

10:14.755 --> 10:18.040
The whole New Jersey
Lucchese crew. We got it all.

10:18.120 --> 10:20.480
Tapes, surveillance videos...

10:20.560 --> 10:23.000
so many witnesses,
they're crawling out of the file cabinets.

10:23.080 --> 10:27.160
Your cousin, your own fuckin' cousin,
Tony Compagna...

10:27.240 --> 10:29.160
he's our star.

10:33.800 --> 10:36.000
- My cousin Tony?
- Your fuckin'-A.

10:36.080 --> 10:39.040
The trial starts next week.
And these pals of yours...

10:39.120 --> 10:42.040
they're gonna be jumpin' over each
others' bodies just to make a deal.

10:42.120 --> 10:47.560
So we get your testimony, you get time
lopped off this sentence. That simple.

10:50.600 --> 10:53.880
You mean, I rat on my friends?

10:55.520 --> 10:59.240
- You have no friends.
- What'd you say?

10:59.320 --> 11:01.440
I have no friends?

11:01.520 --> 11:04.040
Those guys love me, man. I love them.

11:04.120 --> 11:06.040
- They love you?
- Mm-hmm.

11:06.120 --> 11:08.800
For Christ's sakes,
you left the Bruno family.

11:08.880 --> 11:10.800
Lots of guys get
whacked for doing less.

11:10.920 --> 11:14.360
And what's worse,
you switched over to the Luccheses.

11:14.480 --> 11:19.120
Trust me when I tell you they don't like
each other. The Brunos want you dead.

11:19.200 --> 11:23.640
By the way, how did you get
from Brunos to Luccheses?

11:23.720 --> 11:26.040
I took a cab.

11:26.120 --> 11:28.880
You took a cab?

11:34.040 --> 11:39.200
Now listen to me, you guinea cocksucker.
Don't fuck with me.

11:39.280 --> 11:42.880
We're taking down the whole
fuckin' family, do you understand?

11:42.960 --> 11:45.045
This trial's gonna
take at least a year.

11:45.080 --> 11:49.600
76 counts, 20 defendants,
I don't know how many defense lawyers...

11:49.720 --> 11:51.640
at least four prosecutors...

11:51.720 --> 11:54.040
eight alternates on the jury
in case you fucks...

11:54.120 --> 11:56.240
try to reach one of them
to get a mistrial.

11:56.320 --> 12:00.280
This is the biggest thing
I'll ever have in my life.

12:01.320 --> 12:03.920
Never lost a case.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.320
And I sure as shit
won't start with this one.

12:06.400 --> 12:10.880
I'm gonna watch all of you taking it
up the ass for the rest of your lives.

12:10.960 --> 12:13.560
And that's the only kind of love
you pricks are gonna get.

12:15.640 --> 12:17.560
So what's your answer?

12:19.680 --> 12:22.160
Fuck you.

12:28.160 --> 12:30.600
Get this piece of shit out of here.

12:40.760 --> 12:44.280
- Mr. Kierney.
- Yeah?

12:45.840 --> 12:47.760
You got a brother?

12:49.040 --> 12:51.040
Yeah.

12:52.680 --> 12:55.880
Well, fuck him too.

12:55.915 --> 12:59.080
You set up that meeting, didn't you?

12:59.200 --> 13:02.360
Well, if somebody's gonna make a deal,
Jackie, I want it to be you.

13:02.440 --> 13:04.960
Aw, fanculo, you motherfucker.

13:05.040 --> 13:09.240
That's why they did the dope trial, so they
could use it to squeeze me on this one.

13:09.320 --> 13:11.520
You should know that!

13:11.600 --> 13:13.840
I've been in prison half my life.

13:13.920 --> 13:16.560
- You think I'm gonna start making deals now?
- Listen, Jackie.

13:16.640 --> 13:20.040
My job is to give you the best legal
advice I can. That's what you pay me for.

13:20.120 --> 13:22.560
I paid you 250,000
for my last trial...

13:22.640 --> 13:24.760
and I'm sitting here
holding my dick.

13:24.880 --> 13:27.160
How much you wanna
charge me for this one?

13:27.240 --> 13:31.560
- Look at all the work we've put in on this thing.
- How much you wanna charge me?

13:31.640 --> 13:35.240
- Ah, 60,000, give or take a few.
- 60,000?

13:35.320 --> 13:38.160
Take your fuckin' briefcase,
and get the fuck out of my cell.

13:38.240 --> 13:41.760
Sylvester, get this piece
of shit out of my cell!

13:43.120 --> 13:46.620
Jackie, pack up.
You're movin' out.

13:46.655 --> 13:50.120
- Movin' out?
- Another cell block.

13:50.200 --> 13:52.120
Is it bigger?

14:01.960 --> 14:04.760
Oh, my God. Sylvester, listen.

14:04.840 --> 14:08.960
My chair, I gotta have my chair.
I can't sleep without my chair.

14:09.040 --> 14:12.240
- I'll talk to the guy.
- No, Sylvester. You don't understand.

14:12.320 --> 14:15.120
I can't sleep without my chair.
I got a bad back. You see, when-

14:17.560 --> 14:20.500
- What the hell are you still doing here?
- Aw, come on, Jackie.

14:20.535 --> 14:23.440
- You owe me $60,000 for all the work I did so far.
- Oh, Rizzo.

14:23.520 --> 14:27.080
Send me a bill. I'll wipe my ass with it.
Would that be okay?

14:27.160 --> 14:29.080
- Oh, God.
- Get him the fuck out of here.

14:40.320 --> 14:42.880
- He's all yours.
- Thanks, Jesse.

14:51.560 --> 14:54.120
All the way to the end.

15:11.720 --> 15:14.080
You wanna give me a hand?

15:54.280 --> 15:56.280
Mr. Calabrese!

15:56.360 --> 15:58.440
Mr. Calabrese has no comment
at the present time.

15:58.520 --> 16:00.440
Mr. Calabrese,
is the third time a charm?

16:00.520 --> 16:03.920
Justice will prevail, and my client
will be exonerated. Thank you very much.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.800
Mr. Calabrese, you think
you're a three-time loser?

16:37.400 --> 16:39.320
Oh, look at you.
You dressed up.

16:39.400 --> 16:42.000
- Hey, good to see you.
- How you been, huh?

16:42.080 --> 16:44.000
- Good luck, bro.
- Nice chatting with you.

16:45.760 --> 16:47.840
- Okay.
- Hey, Jackie.

16:47.960 --> 16:49.880
- How are you?
- How you doing? Good?

16:49.960 --> 16:53.320
- Yeah, good to see you.
- All right, all right. Don't be too obvious.

16:53.440 --> 16:55.360
- They let you in here?
- Good haircut.

16:55.440 --> 16:57.480
- Thank you.
- You're gonna look beautiful on TV.

16:57.560 --> 17:00.880
- Carlo, how you doing?
- My man.

17:00.960 --> 17:03.120
Hey, Nick. Good to see you.

17:03.200 --> 17:06.200
What's good about it?

17:13.680 --> 17:16.880
Jackie? I'm Ben Klandis.

17:16.960 --> 17:21.200
- I'm handling Carlo Mascarpone's defense.
- How you doing?

17:21.280 --> 17:25.079
Listen, is it true you're
gonna defend yourself?

17:25.160 --> 17:29.400
What do I need with a lawyer?
So he can get me another 30 years?

17:29.480 --> 17:34.040
- Last trial, I had apnea. You know what apnea is?
- Yeah, I know what apnea-

17:34.075 --> 17:38.600
It's like a sleeping sickness. It's like
I slept through the whole fuckin' trial.

17:38.680 --> 17:42.200
I wake up, the judge
is sentencing me to 30 years.

17:42.280 --> 17:44.440
The hammer comes down.

17:44.520 --> 17:47.720
Bang! It felt like
it landed on my dick.

17:47.800 --> 17:49.840
Nah, this time,
I take care of me myself.

17:49.920 --> 17:53.880
Well, that's the problem.
It's not just you.

17:53.960 --> 17:57.080
They get one of you for spitting on
the sidewalk, and all of you can go down.

17:57.115 --> 18:01.080
R-I-C-O. The "C" in RICO,
it stands for conspiracy.

18:01.160 --> 18:04.080
Conspiracy isn't hard to prove.
Two of you in the same room...

18:04.160 --> 18:07.680
- that's conspiracy.
- I'm not gonna hurt nobody.

18:07.760 --> 18:10.760
You're gonna have to go up against your
cousin, Tony Compagna. Ready for that?

18:10.840 --> 18:13.760
That fucker's the reason
we're all here. He turned.

18:16.080 --> 18:18.880
But you know what?
I'm gonna turn him back.

18:18.960 --> 18:21.960
He's a junkie. Deep down inside
he loves me. He's mine.

18:22.040 --> 18:26.000
Well, let me just, uh, get somebody to sit
with you so you don't make any legal errors.

18:26.080 --> 18:28.000
It's a goddamn jungle in here.

18:28.120 --> 18:31.520
Let me tell you something.

18:31.600 --> 18:34.320
When they fucked with me...

18:34.400 --> 18:36.320
they woke a sleeping giant.

18:36.400 --> 18:38.800
I'll handle it.

18:38.880 --> 18:41.000
All rise.

18:44.800 --> 18:47.840
The honorable
Sidney Finestein presiding.

18:52.920 --> 18:54.920
Be seated.

19:01.640 --> 19:05.000
Members of the jury, by law,
you have to be able to see the witness box.

19:05.080 --> 19:08.040
- Can you all see the witness box?
- Yes, Your Honor.

19:09.400 --> 19:11.320
Defendants, defense attorneys...

19:11.400 --> 19:15.080
you may have to shift in your seats
a little to see the witnesses.

19:15.160 --> 19:19.000
Sorry, it's the best we can do.
We've never had so many defendants before.

19:21.960 --> 19:23.880
Counselor.

19:23.960 --> 19:26.160
Ladies and gentlemen.

19:29.120 --> 19:32.680
"We own New Jersey!"

19:33.760 --> 19:35.680
This is the boast of a mob family...

19:35.760 --> 19:40.000
that controlled an endless
list of criminal activities.

19:42.120 --> 19:45.000
The term "conspiracy" in Latin...

19:45.080 --> 19:48.520
means to breathe together.

19:48.600 --> 19:53.280
And these defendants breathed
a life of crime together.

19:54.600 --> 19:57.000
Our evidence will show
that Carlo Mascarpone...

19:57.080 --> 20:01.720
was the underboss of the New Jersey
faction of the Lucchese crime family.

20:01.800 --> 20:04.680
The Luccheses,
one of the Five Families...

20:04.800 --> 20:08.720
as vicious and dangerous
a crew as any in the nation.

20:08.840 --> 20:12.600
Gino Mascarpone. Gino ran
the day-to-day gambling...

20:12.680 --> 20:16.640
loan-sharking and extortion
activities for his boss, Nick Calabrese.

20:16.720 --> 20:19.480
Danny Roma,
family soldier and enforcer.

20:19.560 --> 20:22.480
Alessandro Tedeschi,
loan-sharking and gambling.

20:22.560 --> 20:24.760
Tino Bellochio,
numbers and gambling.

20:24.840 --> 20:29.440
Dominic Crespi, gambling and numbers.
Jackie DiNorscio, cocaine distribution.

20:31.040 --> 20:35.560
You'll get to know the rest
as we drag them up to the witness box.

20:35.640 --> 20:39.600
Liars, sociopaths, murderers.

20:39.720 --> 20:41.965
- This guy thinks he's Eliot Ness.
- He's good.

20:42.000 --> 20:45.040
Finally, you will hear
from Tony Compagna...

20:45.160 --> 20:47.320
Jackie DiNorscio's own cousin.

20:47.400 --> 20:51.800
It was Mr. Compagna that started
the ball rolling in this investigation.

20:51.880 --> 20:53.800
A man, who fearing for his life...

20:53.880 --> 20:58.760
agreed to cooperate and tell all he knew
about the inner workings of this mob...

20:58.840 --> 21:01.760
this group of leeches
that suck money...

21:01.840 --> 21:05.320
out of every enterprise,
legitimate or illegitimate...

21:05.400 --> 21:08.280
to support their
extravagant lifestyles.

21:10.160 --> 21:11.965
Now, we will be asking you...

21:12.000 --> 21:16.360
to examine an awesome
amount of evidence.

21:16.440 --> 21:19.160
And I am sorry about that.

21:20.000 --> 21:23.000
But the severity of these crimes...

21:23.080 --> 21:26.080
against the people of this community...

21:26.160 --> 21:30.080
in fact, all America...

21:30.160 --> 21:35.160
make it necessary
for you to do just that.

21:37.520 --> 21:39.920
Thank you.

21:40.000 --> 21:43.600
We will now hear opening statements
from defense counsels.

21:43.680 --> 21:48.560
Mr. Cellano represents,
uh, defendant Dominic Crespi.

21:48.640 --> 21:51.000
...the government's tapes,
you will conclude...

21:51.120 --> 21:55.080
that my client is not guilty
of anything more than-

21:55.200 --> 21:57.480
Since when is it a crime
to wear fancy clothes...

21:57.560 --> 22:00.160
and an expensive diamond pinky ring
and drive a Cadillac?

22:00.240 --> 22:03.560
If you arrested everyone who ever made
a friendly wager on a sporting event...

22:03.640 --> 22:07.040
you'd have to lock up half of
the people in this courtroom.

22:07.120 --> 22:11.120
- You're up soon. You ready?
- And all of this in 40 years of driving.

22:11.155 --> 22:14.200
I got nothing written down.

22:14.280 --> 22:16.280
Well, what are you gonna say then?

22:18.080 --> 22:20.680
How the fuck do I know?
This whole case is a joke, right?

22:20.800 --> 22:24.640
Mr. Klandis is representing
defendant Carlo Mascarpone.

23:04.120 --> 23:06.560
Right in front of you,
ladies and gentlemen...

23:06.640 --> 23:10.360
is this Latin motto,
whose translation is.;

23:10.440 --> 23:15.880
"Let justice be done,
though the heavens may fall."

23:18.160 --> 23:23.560
I have the fate
of Carlo Mascarpone in my hands.

23:23.640 --> 23:28.240
There he is sitting near
his brother Gino.

23:28.360 --> 23:31.480
They didn’t join the Lucchese family,
because they already had one...

23:31.600 --> 23:35.360
the family created
by Mr. And Mrs. Mascarpone.

23:35.440 --> 23:38.840
It's called biology.

23:38.920 --> 23:43.720
You'll hear a lot about
my client's flamboyant lifestyle.

23:43.800 --> 23:47.000
His wife, Rosalynd,
sits in this courtroom...

23:47.080 --> 23:50.600
married 17 years, four children.

23:50.680 --> 23:53.840
That's a lifestyle.

23:53.920 --> 23:58.840
He goes to St. Lucy's church.
His wife teaches C.C.D.

23:58.960 --> 24:02.045
That's a lifestyle.

24:02.080 --> 24:05.760
Many of these defendants are related,
some are friends or neighbors...

24:05.795 --> 24:09.440
that have known each other since
playing Little League baseball together.

24:09.520 --> 24:11.440
That's a lifestyle.

24:11.520 --> 24:15.560
They are a family.

24:15.640 --> 24:18.200
Not the kind of family
the government talks about.

24:18.280 --> 24:22.080
They would twist it.
They would make it evil.

24:22.160 --> 24:24.840
But all we're asking for,
ladies and gentlemen...

24:24.920 --> 24:30.120
is to let justice be done,
though the heavens may fall.

24:31.920 --> 24:34.040
Thank you.

24:37.640 --> 24:41.160
Okay.
Let's see who's next.

24:42.080 --> 24:45.480
Mr. DiNorscio.
Mr. DiNorscio.

24:45.560 --> 24:48.440
Isn't your attorney here?

24:48.520 --> 24:52.560
Well, Your Honor,
I think I'm-I'm better off-

24:53.640 --> 24:55.560
Say that again.

24:55.640 --> 25:00.080
Uh, I- I wanna go pro se.
I'm gonna be my own lawyer.

25:02.080 --> 25:04.040
Do you know what "pro se" means?

25:04.120 --> 25:07.480
- Sort of.
- What do you mean, "sort of"?

25:07.600 --> 25:13.200
Uh, if you defend yourself, it's called
"pro se." I'm gonna defend myself.

25:13.280 --> 25:16.480
Mr. DiNorscio, in a case of this
magnitude, I don't think it's advisable.

25:16.560 --> 25:19.360
My Sixth Amendment right.

25:19.440 --> 25:22.480
I mean, I got the right to defend myself.
Am I correct, Judge?

25:22.515 --> 25:25.520
Yes. Yeah, you're correct.
Have you had any legal experience?

25:26.600 --> 25:29.840
Uh, well, sort of.

25:29.920 --> 25:32.000
What do you mean, "sort of"?

25:34.080 --> 25:36.560
I've been in prison half my life.

25:40.960 --> 25:44.320
Sometimes I think
I had too much legal experience.

25:44.440 --> 25:47.000
Mr. DiNorscio,
have you heard the saying...

25:47.120 --> 25:51.080
that a man who represents himself
has a fool for a client?

25:51.160 --> 25:54.280
Now I have. Is it true, Judge?

25:54.360 --> 25:57.000
Sometimes it is.

25:58.120 --> 26:00.040
So that means sometimes it ain't, right?

26:02.840 --> 26:04.840
Okay.

26:04.920 --> 26:07.560
- Thank you, Judge.
- But I don't think it's advisable. It's up to you.

26:07.640 --> 26:11.040
Uh, Mr. DiNorscio, you're on.

26:27.680 --> 26:30.800
Hi, I'm Jackie DiNorscio.

26:32.160 --> 26:35.240
Uh, I'm defending myself
in this case.

26:36.960 --> 26:38.880
You'll have to excuse me,
I'm a little nervous.

26:38.960 --> 26:42.160
You see, I'm no lawyer.

26:42.240 --> 26:45.720
I only have a sixth-grade education.

26:45.840 --> 26:50.880
And, uh, I'm not sophisticated in the law
like some of these other persons here.

26:53.320 --> 26:55.560
But what I tell you
will come from the heart.

26:57.720 --> 27:00.200
Four months ago...

27:00.280 --> 27:04.640
we started to pick jurors for this trial.

27:04.720 --> 27:07.000
And I wanna say right now...

27:07.080 --> 27:11.320
that I'm satisfied
with everybody on the jury.

27:11.400 --> 27:14.200
And I wanna thank Mr. Klandis...

27:14.280 --> 27:17.160
for translating that Latin slogan
in front of the judge.

27:17.195 --> 27:19.360
I thought it meant "No smoking."

27:19.480 --> 27:21.760
I was literally about to light up.

27:24.400 --> 27:27.240
Like I said, uh...

27:27.320 --> 27:30.480
I'm no lawyer...

27:30.560 --> 27:35.760
uh, so I don't know where they
came up with this RICO law thing.

27:35.840 --> 27:41.040
Should probably ask Mr. Kierney. I guess
if you're Italian, you should be in prison.

27:43.160 --> 27:45.960
I've read the RICO Act, and
I can tell you it's more appropriate...

27:46.040 --> 27:51.640
for some of those guys over in Washington
than it is for me or any of my fellas here.

27:55.480 --> 27:59.000
- Are you through, Mr. DiNorscio?
- Uh, no, Judge.

28:08.920 --> 28:11.760
How do I look, good?

28:13.040 --> 28:15.640
You see this hat?

28:15.720 --> 28:20.640
I'm wearing this hat
to make me look like a gangster.

28:22.000 --> 28:25.200
'Cause that's what
that table wants me to be...

28:25.320 --> 28:28.040
a gangster.

28:28.160 --> 28:32.520
But I'm not a gangster,
ladies and gentlemen.

28:32.640 --> 28:35.560
I'm a gagster.
This ain't even my hat.

28:39.240 --> 28:41.040
Thank you, Mr. Washington.

28:42.120 --> 28:44.480
Now, I'm sure Mr. Kierney...

28:44.560 --> 28:48.120
will tell you I've been
in jail half my life, most of my life.

28:55.160 --> 28:58.320
It's true.

28:58.440 --> 29:02.000
I'd rather go to jail
for a thousand years...

29:02.120 --> 29:04.080
than to ever rat
on any of my friends.

29:06.560 --> 29:10.160
Do you know that this government...

29:10.240 --> 29:12.600
this government offered me a deal...

29:12.680 --> 29:15.040
to join their list of witnesses...

29:15.120 --> 29:17.200
- and lie about these men here?
- Objection.

29:17.280 --> 29:19.320
Sustained. Mr. DiNorscio.

29:19.400 --> 29:22.640
- What?
- You will confine the opening statement-

29:22.720 --> 29:25.680
- But I-
- to the evidence to be presented.

29:27.480 --> 29:30.560
Thank you, Judge.
I got it. Okay.

29:32.920 --> 29:36.000
Ladies and gentlemen...

29:36.120 --> 29:40.040
the evidence will show that they
wanted me to lie about my friends.

29:40.120 --> 29:43.080
- Objection.
- Overruled.
- And I just could never do that.

29:43.160 --> 29:45.840
I grew up with these guys.
How long I known you guys?

29:45.920 --> 29:47.840
I've known them since
we were little babies.

29:47.920 --> 29:51.880
I love these guys.
They're all I got.

29:51.915 --> 29:55.840
But now all the prosecutor's got...

29:55.920 --> 30:00.200
is a nutcase, two junkies
and a bank robber.

30:00.280 --> 30:03.680
- Objection.
- Sustained. Mr. DiNorscio.

30:03.760 --> 30:06.760
I got this, Judge.

30:06.840 --> 30:10.320
They talk about us being extravagant.
You hear him before?

30:10.440 --> 30:13.960
"To support their
extravagant lifestyles."

30:14.040 --> 30:16.160
Do I look extravagant?

30:16.240 --> 30:19.880
One day, my wife asked me for $20
to buy a rump roast from the butcher.

30:19.960 --> 30:22.760
I told her, "$20 for a rump roast?"

30:22.840 --> 30:26.440
Of which I took her to the kitchen
where we got a full-length mirror.

30:26.520 --> 30:30.720
I pull out a $20 bill out of my pocket.
I hold it up to the mirror.

30:30.800 --> 30:34.760
I say, "Sweetheart, you see
that $20 bill in the mirror?

30:34.840 --> 30:37.120
That one belongs to you.
This one belongs to me."

30:37.200 --> 30:39.600
And I'm out of there. It's over.

30:39.720 --> 30:42.640
The next day, ladies and gentlemen,
I come home...

30:42.720 --> 30:47.440
and I see roasted meats from
one end of the table to the other.

30:47.520 --> 30:51.400
And I asked her, I said, "Honey,
where'd all the meat come from?"

30:51.480 --> 30:53.680
So she took me back over
to the full-length mirror.

30:53.760 --> 30:58.600
She lifts up her dress,
ladies and gentlemen.

30:58.680 --> 31:00.600
She points to the mirror
and she says...

31:00.680 --> 31:03.080
"The one in the mirror
is yours, honey.

31:03.160 --> 31:05.080
This one belongs to the butcher."

31:07.880 --> 31:11.600
I mean, extravagant? Do I look extravagant?

31:11.680 --> 31:14.680
- Mr. DiNorscio.
- I woulda wore a better suit.

31:14.800 --> 31:16.680
Mr. DiNorscio!

31:18.080 --> 31:20.480
Hey, all right. Everybody,
please quiet down.

31:20.600 --> 31:24.200
Please, you'll all
get a ch-chance to talk.

31:24.280 --> 31:26.920
Max, how do you think it went?

31:27.000 --> 31:31.000
Well, I haven't had a chance to talk
to Nick yet, but all in all, not a bad day.

31:31.080 --> 31:33.280
Ben, I thought you were terrific.

31:33.360 --> 31:37.280
Chris, Frank, Henry,
all of you, good work.

31:37.360 --> 31:40.800
Then that fuckin' lunatic gets up there,
and I don't know what to think anymore.

31:40.880 --> 31:45.000
- I don't know if it's good or bad.
- Bad. All bad.

31:45.080 --> 31:47.240
We got a major
RICO trial going on here...

31:47.360 --> 31:50.080
and all of a sudden we gotta
contend with fuckin' Shecky Green.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.440
Ben, the guy's
a time bomb out there.

31:54.560 --> 31:58.680
You know the cliché, "Never ask a question
you don't know the answer to"?

31:58.760 --> 32:01.720
He's gonna ask a question,
or he's gonna say something...

32:01.800 --> 32:05.120
or something is gonna pop out of that
shit-hole of a mouth that he's got...

32:05.155 --> 32:07.040
and we're gonna get hurt.

32:07.120 --> 32:10.080
Well, see, you know,
I'm not sure I agree.

32:11.160 --> 32:13.680
I was stealing looks at the jury.

32:13.760 --> 32:16.520
They were with him.
They were laughing with him.

32:16.600 --> 32:19.040
So let me throw that other
cliché out at you.

32:19.160 --> 32:21.760
"A laughing jury
is never a hanging jury."

32:21.880 --> 32:23.800
Let's sleep on this...

32:23.880 --> 32:26.280
wait it out a couple of days,
see how it develops.

32:26.400 --> 32:28.960
I can always rein him in later.

32:29.080 --> 32:31.920
Nobody can take him seriously.
He's a clown up there.

32:32.000 --> 32:34.400
- Jokes about his wife's twat. Are you kidding me?
- I agree.

32:34.480 --> 32:38.360
I-In a week, they'll see him and
the rest of them for the morons they are.

32:38.440 --> 32:40.360
I don't want 'em to see
those guys as morons.

32:40.440 --> 32:45.760
I want that jury to see pimps, liars,
racketeers, arsonists and murderers.

32:45.840 --> 32:47.760
It's an old saying,
but I believe it.

32:47.840 --> 32:50.080
"A laughing jury
ain't a hanging jury."

32:50.160 --> 32:52.120
- And he had 'em laughing.
- I don't agree at all, Sean.

32:52.200 --> 32:56.840
Laughing at him can indicate
disrespect as well.

32:56.960 --> 33:00.240
I don't know if you noticed, but a couple of
the women in the jury looked deeply offended.

33:00.320 --> 33:02.520
- He'll step over the line. You'll see.
- It's an act.

33:02.600 --> 33:06.000
No, it's not an act. That's what makes him
dangerous. He's like some '60s pop tune.

33:06.080 --> 33:08.400
"All you need is love." Fuck.

33:08.480 --> 33:11.080
Like some Deepak Chopra
with a pinky ring.

33:11.160 --> 33:14.440
See you, Nick.
See you guys.

33:16.560 --> 33:18.600
Good night, Nicky.

33:19.920 --> 33:21.840
Counselor.

33:33.680 --> 33:35.600
You're dead wrong, counselor.

33:35.680 --> 33:37.600
You'll never rein him in.

33:37.680 --> 33:40.720
He's fuckin' crazy.
I've known him a long time.

33:40.800 --> 33:43.800
He's out for number one. He'll have
that jury laughin', and he'll get off.

33:43.880 --> 33:46.120
And we'll be standin' there
with our dicks in our hand.

33:46.155 --> 33:48.440
- Nick, see-
- Now, now, listen to me.

33:48.520 --> 33:50.720
This is my fuckin' life on the line.

33:50.800 --> 33:54.280
I gotta be sure. It looks
to me like he's hurting us.

33:54.360 --> 33:57.480
- I'm separating him from the case.
- It's-It's not up to you.

33:57.560 --> 34:01.620
- You wanna bet?
- Don't get stupid on me, Nick.

34:01.655 --> 34:05.680
I'm a lot of things.
Stupid ain't one of them.

34:08.960 --> 34:11.080
Have a good day, counselor.

34:17.320 --> 34:20.199
Hey, Mickey. Aw.

34:22.840 --> 34:25.159
You hungry?

34:26.560 --> 34:28.639
Huh?

34:28.719 --> 34:31.120
Thank you, Your Honor.

34:40.199 --> 34:43.679
Mr. Juarez, is this
the agreement that you signed?

34:43.760 --> 34:45.679
- Yes, sir.
- Now, Mr. Juarez...

34:45.760 --> 34:50.560
you're here as a witness as part of a plea-bargain
agreement with the government, correct?

34:50.639 --> 34:55.000
Yes, sir. I got busted.
And I was facing 40 years, so I flipped.

34:55.080 --> 34:57.000
Regarding your narcotics sales...

34:57.080 --> 35:02.080
you split the proceeds from those
transactions with Mr. DiNorscio.

35:02.160 --> 35:06.280
- That's right.
- And how was Nick Calabrese involved?

35:06.400 --> 35:10.560
I heard-
I heard he always got his cut.

35:10.680 --> 35:13.000
- Objection. Hearsay.
- Sustained.

35:13.080 --> 35:16.005
Just your personal
experience, Mr. Juarez.

35:16.040 --> 35:20.800
- Did you ever meet Mr. Calabrese in person?
- Once.

35:20.880 --> 35:25.760
I was at a birthday party for Jackie’s
daughter, and he was there.

35:25.840 --> 35:27.760
Jackie told me who Nick really was.

35:27.840 --> 35:30.600
Why would Mr. DiNorscio confide in you?

35:30.680 --> 35:34.240
Jackie and me,
we used to party together a lot.

35:34.320 --> 35:37.240
We were doing coke.
We'd get high and...

35:37.320 --> 35:41.600
when we had broads,
Jackie liked to nail 'em two at a time.

35:46.720 --> 35:48.640
Thank you, Mr. Juarez.

35:48.720 --> 35:51.560
- Mr. DiNorscio.
- You know, not for nothing, Judge...

35:51.640 --> 35:55.160
but I thought this was the RICO Act,
not the Puerto Rico Act.

35:57.760 --> 36:00.280
How you doing, pal?

36:01.840 --> 36:05.040
Now, Octavio, let's be honest here.

36:05.120 --> 36:10.040
- You and me, we did a lot of jobs together, right?
- Right.

36:10.120 --> 36:12.240
You remember that one with Diego?

36:12.320 --> 36:15.965
I sure do.

36:16.000 --> 36:19.480
- Mind tellin' us about it?
- No you-you tell them.

36:19.560 --> 36:22.160
- Tell the jury.
- No, you tell them.

36:22.240 --> 36:26.440
I can't tell, Octavio.
I got my lawyer hat on.

36:26.520 --> 36:29.960
Besides, if I tell it,
they're gonna think I'm bragging.

36:30.040 --> 36:33.840
Well, you walk in...

36:33.920 --> 36:36.440
and when their coke was on the table
next to our money...

36:36.520 --> 36:39.320
- you pull a gun.
- And then what?

36:39.400 --> 36:43.920
Diego says, "You only got
six shots in that thing...

36:44.000 --> 36:46.760
- and there is seven of us."
- And?

36:46.880 --> 36:49.000
I'll never forget it.

36:49.120 --> 36:52.240
You said, "How about
if I shoot the six of you...

36:52.320 --> 36:54.680
and strangle
the seventh motherfucker?"

36:57.240 --> 37:01.160
- And we walk out, right?
- With the money and the coke.

37:01.240 --> 37:06.120
Now, Octavio, have you ever-
I don't think anyone has-

37:06.200 --> 37:11.520
- have you ever heard me
try to deny me using cocaine?
- No way.

37:11.600 --> 37:15.520
No, of course not.
I wouldn't deny using cocaine ever.

37:15.600 --> 37:17.600
I loved it.
In fact, did you bring any?

37:19.720 --> 37:22.280
What did he say?
I didn't hear the punch line.

37:27.680 --> 37:30.920
The main point was to tie
Calabrese to Jackie. We got that.

37:31.000 --> 37:32.920
And, Peter,
call Manhattan Correctional.

37:33.000 --> 37:36.680
- Fuckin' Jackie's got himself set up
like he was at a hotel.
- Okay.

37:36.760 --> 37:39.800
- Tell 'em I don't want him too comfortable.
- Got it.

37:41.000 --> 37:43.360
Hey, Jackie.
How was court today, man?

37:43.440 --> 37:46.800
- I killed 'em again.
- Good.

37:46.880 --> 37:52.160
- Jesse, where's my lounger?
- The word come down, Jackie.
You live like everybody else.

37:52.195 --> 37:55.880
Yeah, but I can't- I can't sleep
layin' down. I gotta sleep half sitting.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.840
Tough tittie, Jackie Dee.
Them's the conditions which prevail.

37:58.920 --> 38:01.280
Hey, Jesse, you know my back!

38:01.360 --> 38:03.440
How the hell am I
supposed to sleep, Jess?

38:03.520 --> 38:06.600
Aw, you'll figure it out.

38:45.120 --> 38:49.040
Mr. Bellman, how did you
come to know Mr. DiNorscio?

38:49.120 --> 38:53.080
Uh, when I got paroled,
I had no job, no money, nothing.

38:53.160 --> 38:55.080
And a friend of mine
hooked me up with Jackie.

38:55.160 --> 38:57.080
I lived with him
in Florida for a while.

38:57.160 --> 38:59.320
And what was your
relationship with him?

38:59.440 --> 39:04.360
I was a gofer. I, uh, I drove him around,
picked up guns for him...

39:04.480 --> 39:09.840
and I gave rides to his friends, and, uh,
I brought messages back and forth...

39:09.920 --> 39:11.880
from him and some of
these defendants here.

39:11.960 --> 39:15.120
And did you ever see
any drug transactions take place?

39:15.155 --> 39:17.000
I was there when they were
cuttin' up the money.

39:17.080 --> 39:20.000
And to the best of your knowledge,
how was that money distributed?

39:20.080 --> 39:24.280
Uh, me and Jackie got a share.

39:25.560 --> 39:27.560
Jimmy the Jew got his.

39:27.640 --> 39:30.000
I mean, uh, Jimmy Katz.

39:30.080 --> 39:35.000
And, uh, of course the boss,
Nick Calabrese, got the big cut.

39:35.120 --> 39:37.320
Did you witness this?

39:38.720 --> 39:42.040
Jackie and Jimmy, yes.

39:42.120 --> 39:44.280
- Not Nick.
- Move to strike as hearsay.

39:44.360 --> 39:47.760
Sustained.
Strike the reference to Mr. Calabrese.

39:47.840 --> 39:51.720
And when did your relationship
with Mr. DiNorscio end?

39:51.800 --> 39:55.920
Well, you see, Jackie started
gettin' nutty from all the coke.

39:56.000 --> 40:00.880
One Christmas, he wanted me
to get chickens to cook for a party.

40:00.960 --> 40:03.680
I got tired of runnin'
errands for him.

40:03.760 --> 40:07.400
When I didn't get the chickens,
he threw me out of the house.

40:07.520 --> 40:09.720
That's the last I saw of him.

40:09.840 --> 40:13.080
Thank you, Mr. Bellman.
Your witness.

40:19.760 --> 40:21.960
Now, tell the truth, Harry.

40:22.040 --> 40:24.320
Isn't the real reason
I threw you out of that house...

40:24.400 --> 40:27.400
'cause I refused sexual
advances from you to me?

40:27.480 --> 40:29.800
- What? Objection!
- Sustained.

40:29.880 --> 40:33.520
Now, Harry, isn't it true that the guys
in jail used to call you Mary?

40:33.600 --> 40:35.520
- Objection.
- No, that's not true!

40:35.600 --> 40:38.000
Sustained. Mr. DiNorscio.

40:38.080 --> 40:40.960
I warned you.

40:43.080 --> 40:47.120
Harry, when you got out of prison...

40:48.520 --> 40:51.440
isn't it true you didn't
have a dime to your name?

40:53.280 --> 40:57.880
Didn't I take you in?
Didn't I treat you good?

40:57.960 --> 41:02.240
- And this is how you pay me back, by rattin'?
- You treated me like dirt.

41:02.320 --> 41:07.440
You come here and you say that I committed
these crimes after I treated you like a brother.

41:08.800 --> 41:11.000
- Didn't I feed you?
- Yeah, I feed my dogs too.

41:14.640 --> 41:20.480
Look, Harry, how could this jury be sure you're
telling the truth about me breaking the law...

41:20.560 --> 41:23.160
when half the time you were
high from shootin' drugs?

41:23.240 --> 41:25.520
- Objection.
- That's a lie.

41:25.600 --> 41:30.080
Mr. DiNorscio. You have to prove
that statement before you try to use it.

41:30.160 --> 41:32.400
I will, Judge.

41:32.480 --> 41:35.040
Come on, Harry.
Roll up your sleeve.

41:35.120 --> 41:37.600
Show the needle marks to the jury.

41:37.680 --> 41:40.440
- Hey, stay away from me. Stay a-
- Come on, Harry.

41:40.520 --> 41:42.680
Stay away.

41:45.680 --> 41:48.040
That Christmas...

41:48.160 --> 41:52.280
wasn't the real reason
I threw you out of that house...

41:52.400 --> 41:55.520
'cause I woke up one morning and
caught you tryin' to give me a blow job?

41:55.600 --> 41:58.320
Mr. DiNorscio!

41:58.400 --> 42:02.680
- Isn't that the truth, Harry?
- Come on, Jackie. Look at yourself.
You kidding me?

42:02.760 --> 42:06.000
I'm not kidding you.

42:06.080 --> 42:09.680
I see the way you look at me.
I know what's on your mind.

42:16.880 --> 42:19.080
You wanna suck on this
instead for a while?

42:19.200 --> 42:21.720
Mr. DiNorscio should be
held in contempt of court.

42:21.800 --> 42:25.240
Remove the jury!

42:25.360 --> 42:27.400
Lunch. Two hours.

42:33.120 --> 42:36.160
Jackie, Jackie. What a fuckin' job
you're doin; man.

42:36.240 --> 42:38.920
- You're wearing 'em out.
Keep it up. Love you, baby.
- All right.

42:39.000 --> 42:42.000
Ben. Ben.

42:42.080 --> 42:44.280
Can you do me a favor?

42:44.360 --> 42:46.400
I don't think so.

42:46.480 --> 42:48.400
Why?
What the hell did I do?

42:48.480 --> 42:52.360
Two ladies on the jury were looking at you
as if they wouldn't pick you up with tongs.

42:52.440 --> 42:54.520
I can't let my client
be affected by your behavior.

42:54.640 --> 42:58.160
You damn well better control
yourself or you're on your own.

42:58.195 --> 43:00.880
Okay, okay, I got it.

43:00.960 --> 43:03.440
Can you help me out, Ben?

43:03.520 --> 43:05.560
What is it?

43:08.080 --> 43:10.320
I wanna have lunch with the fellas.

43:10.400 --> 43:14.120
Every day my marshals take me
down to the holding cell.

43:14.155 --> 43:16.000
Technically,
you're still a prisoner, Jackie.

43:16.080 --> 43:18.040
You think I don't know that?

43:18.120 --> 43:23.120
Ben, Ben. I asked them this morning
if I could have lunch with the fellas.

43:23.200 --> 43:26.560
I grew up with most of them.
By now they're family.

43:29.600 --> 43:32.520
If it's okay with your marshals,
it's okay with me.

43:36.960 --> 43:38.920
- Hey!
- Hey, Jackie.

43:39.000 --> 43:42.080
You guys save any for me? Huh?

43:42.160 --> 43:45.800
Hiya, Nick.

43:45.880 --> 43:49.120
What are you doing here?
You eat downstairs in the holding cell.

43:49.155 --> 43:52.520
No, my marshal said it was okay
if I ate with you guys.

43:52.600 --> 43:56.080
Nobody cleared it with me.

43:56.160 --> 43:59.200
- I didn't know it had to be cleared with you, Nick.
- Now you know.

44:01.600 --> 44:05.040
You know, Nick, I don't know why
you're giving me such a hard time.

44:05.160 --> 44:09.080
- I love these guys.
- Stop with the love shit, Jackie.

44:09.160 --> 44:12.200
You're so full of shit. What, because
we're from the same neighborhood?

44:12.280 --> 44:15.080
I didn't trust you when you was a kid.
I don't trust you now.

44:15.160 --> 44:17.560
What the fuck are you talkin' about?
You got no reason to say that.

44:17.640 --> 44:19.880
I got no reason?
I got no fuckin' reason?

44:19.960 --> 44:23.040
I see you up there
kissin' ass so you can walk.

44:23.120 --> 44:26.160
You'll suck cock to walk.
You're the faggot, not Bellman.

44:26.240 --> 44:29.240
Now, why don't you
get the fuck out of here?

44:30.440 --> 44:32.520
What, do I stutter?

44:53.720 --> 44:57.800
- Coffee, sir?
- Salami on ham.

45:37.680 --> 45:39.965
Agent Kerry...

45:40.000 --> 45:42.880
you conducted
many hours of surveillance...

45:43.000 --> 45:45.120
on each one of these defendants...

45:45.200 --> 45:49.280
- on trial here today, correct?
- I did.

45:49.360 --> 45:51.760
And did the F.B.I. Conclude...

45:51.840 --> 45:55.920
that an organized crime family
existed in northern New Jersey...

45:56.000 --> 46:00.640
- under the leadership of Nick Calabrese?
- Yes, that is correct.

46:00.720 --> 46:03.280
And how did you determine
that Calabrese was the boss?

46:03.360 --> 46:07.160
Well, I was in a restaurant
in Bloomfield on...

46:07.240 --> 46:10.080
September 19 of last year.

46:10.160 --> 46:12.160
It had a reputation
as being a mob hangout.

46:12.195 --> 46:14.597
Why did it have that reputation?

46:14.632 --> 46:17.000
Because the food was good.

46:17.120 --> 46:19.000
No interruptions.

46:19.120 --> 46:22.000
Thank you, Your Honor.
Go on, sir.

46:22.080 --> 46:26.280
I was at the bar. Uh, you could see
a large, private dining room at the back.

46:26.360 --> 46:28.960
The doors were open, and two very...

46:29.040 --> 46:32.965
well, heavyset gentlemen
in tuxedoes stood by the door.

46:33.000 --> 46:35.640
In the dining room, you could see
a birthday party was going on.

46:35.720 --> 46:37.640
How did you know
it was a birthday party?

46:37.720 --> 46:42.000
They were all wearing paper hats and they had
those things that when you blow on them...

46:42.080 --> 46:44.960
they uncurl and go-

46:45.040 --> 46:46.800
- These were children?
- No, sir.

46:46.920 --> 46:48.880
No, sir.
These were grown men.

46:50.480 --> 46:52.400
- Go on.
- Well, at the head of a horseshoe table...

46:52.480 --> 46:55.720
sat, uh, Mr. Calabrese.

46:55.800 --> 47:00.720
And as I observed, all these Italian males
lined up to kiss his ring.

47:00.800 --> 47:03.400
It was obvious to me
that they were paying respects...

47:03.480 --> 47:06.000
to Mr. Calabrese as being the boss.

47:06.080 --> 47:10.000
It was like out of the movies.
There was no other conclusion.

47:12.160 --> 47:15.000
Thank you, Agent Kerry.

47:15.080 --> 47:18.080
- Mr. Klandis?
- No questions, Your Honor.

47:18.160 --> 47:21.600
Mr. Novardis?

47:21.720 --> 47:24.040
I have nothing for this witness,
Your Honor.

47:24.160 --> 47:27.800
- There are no further questions.
- I'd like to ask him something.

47:30.240 --> 47:32.800
- Mr. DiNorscio.
- Thank you, Your Honor.

47:38.000 --> 47:43.965
Mr. Kerry, I was wondering
about something.

47:44.000 --> 47:49.920
Could you tell all of us how you knew that
those men in that restaurant was Italian?

47:50.000 --> 47:52.320
Well, it- Uh.

47:52.400 --> 47:55.965
I-You know, I guess that-

47:56.000 --> 47:59.320
Hey, they all looked Italian to me.

47:59.400 --> 48:02.080
- Wow.
- You know...

48:02.160 --> 48:06.320
with the hand gestures and the back
slapping and the kissing and everything.

48:06.400 --> 48:09.640
Did they teach you that in F.B.I. School
that that's how Italians act?

48:09.720 --> 48:13.760
No. No, that's not part
of our training. No.

48:18.520 --> 48:21.040
- You speak Italian?
- No.

48:21.120 --> 48:23.120
No?

48:25.120 --> 48:28.080
Could you hear them
talking in Italian?

48:28.160 --> 48:29.840
No, I was too far away.

48:34.640 --> 48:38.240
See, I-I'm not understanding this.

48:38.320 --> 48:43.000
You're saying from the back slapping and
the kissing, you knew that they were Italian?

48:45.160 --> 48:48.320
- Well, it was an Italian restaurant.
- Did they all have black hair?

48:48.400 --> 48:52.240
Uh, yeah, yeah.
From what I can remember, yeah.

48:52.320 --> 48:57.000
Could they have been
Spanish, Greek, Jewish?

48:57.080 --> 48:59.880
Not with Nick Calabrese
at the head of the table, no.

49:01.080 --> 49:03.000
You saying Nick
only eats with Italians?

49:03.080 --> 49:05.600
No, I'm not saying that.

49:05.680 --> 49:10.200
What if I told you
I went into a restaurant...

49:10.280 --> 49:13.880
and there was nothing
but Irish guys there?

49:13.960 --> 49:18.680
And you says,
"How'd you know they were Irish?"

49:18.760 --> 49:22.920
And I says, "'Cause they were all drunk,
vomiting all over the floor."

49:23.000 --> 49:24.920
Objection, Your Honor.
Badgering the witness.

49:25.000 --> 49:27.520
- Mr. DiNorscio.
- No, it's all right, Judge.

49:27.600 --> 49:31.520
Look, Mr. DiNorscio. If it walks
like a duck, looks like a duck...

49:31.600 --> 49:35.160
quacks like a duck,
chances are it's a duck.

49:35.280 --> 49:38.360
If it talks like an asshole,
looks likes an asshole...

49:38.480 --> 49:40.440
chances are it's an asshole.

49:40.520 --> 49:43.040
Objection. This behavior cannot be tolerated.

49:43.120 --> 49:46.960
Mr. DiNorscio, I am fining you
$5,000 for contempt of court.

49:47.040 --> 49:49.960
That's what I got, Your Honor.
I got contempt for this court.

49:50.040 --> 49:52.400
You should've stopped him before
with all the Italian shit.

49:52.480 --> 49:55.400
You are now fined 10,000.

49:57.080 --> 49:59.280
Wanna try for 15?

50:01.120 --> 50:04.440
If there are no further questions, I want
to warn the defendants right now...

50:04.520 --> 50:06.440
that if they keep up
this raucous behavior...

50:06.560 --> 50:10.040
they will be liable for contempt
charges with heavy fines.

50:10.120 --> 50:14.240
And you defense attorneys will be
liable to contempt as well...

50:14.320 --> 50:17.160
for not keeping
your clients under control.

50:18.880 --> 50:21.280
Sidebar, my chambers.

50:30.040 --> 50:33.000
Jackie. Jackie.

50:33.080 --> 50:36.965
Jerk-off, don't
say my name ever again.

50:37.000 --> 50:40.560
You say my name again,
I'll cut your fuckin' heart out.

50:40.640 --> 50:44.400
I've done it before.
I'd be thrilled to do it again.

50:51.800 --> 50:54.040
Jackie, what-

50:54.120 --> 50:56.720
what the fuck do you think
you're doing up there?

50:56.800 --> 50:59.200
What?
I speak my mind.

50:59.280 --> 51:03.000
You can kick his dog,
you can spit in his face...

51:03.080 --> 51:06.600
but the one thing a judge never wants
to hear is criticism about his court.

51:08.120 --> 51:11.800
Fuck him. He ain't the jury.
What the fuck could he do?

51:11.880 --> 51:16.960
Jackie, your ignorance is
second only to your arrogance.

51:21.840 --> 51:25.005
Mr. Klandis, how do you think
Mr. DiNorscio's behavior...

51:25.040 --> 51:28.400
is affecting the jury's relationship to
your client and the other defendants?

51:28.480 --> 51:31.000
- Your Honor-
- Don't say a word, Mr. DiNorscio.

51:31.080 --> 51:33.120
Not a word.
Mr. Klandis.

51:34.600 --> 51:37.680
He's clearly a disruptive force.

51:37.760 --> 51:42.680
- Mr. Kierney.
- He undermines the authority of your court.

51:42.760 --> 51:47.960
And if I may say so, you'd never permit
such behavior from a regular attorney.

51:49.240 --> 51:53.520
See any solution?

51:53.600 --> 51:57.200
If he were just the defendant, you could put him
in another room. They both watch it on TV.

51:57.280 --> 51:59.640
But he's his own lawyer.

51:59.720 --> 52:03.120
Unfortunately,
it seems to me there's no choice.

52:03.200 --> 52:07.440
He has to be severed
from this trial and tried separately.

52:07.520 --> 52:09.440
Mr. Klandis?

52:09.520 --> 52:14.840
It's extreme,
but I'm not against it.

52:14.920 --> 52:18.760
I have no idea what
the legal consequences would be.

52:20.600 --> 52:22.920
I'll put my clerk to work on it.

52:29.160 --> 52:31.480
All right, we ready for the jury?

52:31.560 --> 52:34.360
Judge.

52:34.440 --> 52:37.000
Yes, Mr. DiNorscio?

52:37.080 --> 52:39.160
Can I talk to you?

52:44.960 --> 52:49.360
I wanna apologize
for my action in court before.

52:49.440 --> 52:52.000
I want you to understand...

52:52.080 --> 52:57.040
whatever I said,
I meant no disrespect to you.

52:57.160 --> 53:01.400
I respect you more than any other judge
I ever faced, and I faced a lot of them.

53:05.000 --> 53:08.080
Okay, well, thank you,
Mr. DiNorscio.

53:16.800 --> 53:19.280
I was out of line before.

53:22.000 --> 53:25.520
I agree I should be held in contempt.

53:31.160 --> 53:35.160
All right. Bring in the jury.

53:35.280 --> 53:38.120
Jurors, jurors, will you please take
your seats as quickly as possible?

53:38.200 --> 53:40.120
What's going on? You all right?

53:40.200 --> 53:42.120
What's the matter?

53:42.200 --> 53:45.840
I need an opening. Break this up,
here. Come on. E.M.T.

53:45.920 --> 53:48.040
There you go.
There you go. Okay.

53:48.120 --> 53:51.120
I need some room.

53:51.200 --> 53:53.640
I need some room, guys.
Please, give me some room.

53:55.280 --> 53:57.880
Can you breathe?

53:57.960 --> 54:01.560
Watch his head.
Watch his head.

54:01.680 --> 54:05.560
- Bring him all the way up, all the way up.
- Is he in trouble?

54:05.640 --> 54:07.800
You're gonna be all right,
Tommy. Don't worry.

54:07.920 --> 54:09.880
The paramedics are gonna take care of you.

54:10.000 --> 54:11.600
Nappy, want me to call your mother?

54:11.680 --> 54:13.640
Nappy.
All right. Nappy.

54:26.760 --> 54:29.680
Okay.

54:29.760 --> 54:34.160
There, uh, won't be any test results
before Friday, maybe even Monday.

54:34.195 --> 54:36.000
So let's adjourn
until we get-

54:36.080 --> 54:38.000
Your Honor, this trial
is over 11 months old.

54:38.080 --> 54:40.560
We haven't even reached
the halfway mark in our presentation.

54:40.640 --> 54:44.320
Mr. Kierney, I'm not used
to being interrupted.

54:44.400 --> 54:48.040
You are the one who handed in
a witness list of more than 89 people...

54:48.120 --> 54:51.800
and you have already introduced
more than 450 exhibits...

54:51.880 --> 54:53.840
and I am told there are
hundreds more coming...

54:53.920 --> 54:57.520
so let us not complain
about a lengthy trial.

54:57.600 --> 55:03.000
A defendant is sick and he is gonna get
a fair shake in my courtroom, understood?

55:03.080 --> 55:05.800
The clerk will notify you about our next
meeting. Have a good night, gentlemen.

55:18.600 --> 55:21.400
Nappy Napoli.
How do you like that?

55:21.480 --> 55:26.080
- Boy, oh, boy, time is fleeting.
- Time is what?

55:26.160 --> 55:28.560
Fleeting.
Time is fleeting.

55:28.640 --> 55:32.760
What the hell does that mean,
"Time is fleeting"? What's fleeting?

55:32.840 --> 55:36.000
Fleeting. It's like fleeing.
Time is fleeing.

55:36.080 --> 55:39.120
But it's in the past tense,
so they say "fleeting."

55:39.155 --> 55:41.640
You're full of shit.

55:41.760 --> 55:44.040
You're an ignorant slob.

55:45.120 --> 55:47.760
You look good.

55:47.880 --> 55:50.280
You got everything you need?
You're okay on money?

55:50.400 --> 55:52.720
Yeah. Stop worrying
about me, Pop. I'm fine.

55:54.040 --> 55:57.400
How's your brother doing?

55:57.480 --> 56:02.080
Good, I guess. I mean, you know,
I don't really see him too much.

56:02.160 --> 56:05.920
- I worry about him.
- You worry about everything.

56:06.000 --> 56:09.560
Only family.
That's all that matters.

56:09.640 --> 56:13.720
The rest of it's a fart in a hurricane.

56:13.840 --> 56:18.080
- How's your mama doing?
- She looks good. I see her all the time.

56:18.115 --> 56:21.040
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

56:21.160 --> 56:23.560
Say hello for me.

56:23.640 --> 56:27.440
I don't know, Pop. I mean, the last time
I did that she kind of gave me that look...

56:27.520 --> 56:29.440
like I should never say it again.

56:31.960 --> 56:34.360
She's tough.
Boy, is she tough.

56:34.440 --> 56:38.040
You know what the two best words
in the English language are?

56:39.880 --> 56:42.320
Things change.

56:43.480 --> 56:47.080
Okay. First, about Mr. DiNorscio.

56:47.200 --> 56:50.160
Because he's both
a defendant and an attorney...

56:50.280 --> 56:52.240
I think separating him out
at this point...

56:52.360 --> 56:55.200
will make an appeal by
the losing side almost inevitable.

56:55.280 --> 56:58.440
Anyone wanna go through this again?

56:59.840 --> 57:03.000
No.
So he stays.

57:03.080 --> 57:05.000
But I promise you this,
Mr. DiNorscio.

57:05.080 --> 57:08.280
If you are as disruptive
as you have been in the past...

57:08.360 --> 57:10.280
you are out like that.

57:10.360 --> 57:12.760
And to hell with what happens later.

57:12.840 --> 57:14.760
You got me?

57:14.840 --> 57:18.000
Second, trial resumes on Monday.
I've spoken with the doctors.

57:18.080 --> 57:21.400
They feel Mr. Napoli is fully capable of
understanding the proceedings around him.

57:21.520 --> 57:24.005
Your Honor, he can't even sit up.

57:24.040 --> 57:26.520
Arrange for his hospital bed to be
brought into the courtroom.

57:26.600 --> 57:28.600
Your Honor, he's under
heavy medication.

57:28.720 --> 57:30.640
The doctors are cutting it
way back this weekend.

57:30.720 --> 57:34.520
- He falls asleep when I talk to him.
- Make yourself more interesting.

57:34.600 --> 57:36.960
Now, look, goddamn it.
We're a year in.

57:37.040 --> 57:40.840
This trial is going forward.
Monday, 10:00 a.m.

57:44.880 --> 57:47.080
Hey, there's Tommy Napoli!

58:21.360 --> 58:24.240
- I'm glad to see youse guys.
- Look at these shoes.

58:27.200 --> 58:29.680
All rise.

58:29.760 --> 58:34.600
Nappy Napoli can't rise.
Is it all right if he stays layin' down?

58:34.680 --> 58:37.440
Mr. DiNorscio.

58:38.880 --> 58:41.320
Be seated.

58:42.720 --> 58:47.120
You can see their autos
parked here near the entrance.

58:47.200 --> 58:50.120
There are two Lincolns...

58:50.200 --> 58:54.240
and one, two, three Cadillacs...

58:54.320 --> 58:57.440
as well as other
vehicles parked nearby.

58:57.520 --> 59:02.120
We continued our surveillance
until Mr. Mascarpone and Mr. Roma...

59:02.155 --> 59:05.720
got in their cars and left...

59:05.840 --> 59:08.920
nine hours later at 4:00 a.m.

59:09.040 --> 59:13.040
Agent Petraki, when you arrested
my client, Carlo Mascarpone...

59:13.120 --> 59:15.040
- did he resist in any way?
- No.

59:15.120 --> 59:18.120
I had a very pleasant conversation
with Mr. Mascarpone.

59:18.200 --> 59:20.120
And what did you talk about?

59:20.200 --> 59:23.720
We discussed political
philosophy and history.

59:23.800 --> 59:27.040
I found out that he was
a great admirer of Machiavelli.

59:27.120 --> 59:32.280
So you discussed Machiavelli. No discussions
of shakedowns, payoffs or rubouts, correct?

59:32.360 --> 59:36.640
That's correct. But since I once taught
a class in political philosophy...

59:36.760 --> 59:41.920
I thought it ironic that Carlo Mascarpone
was an admirer of Machiavelli...

59:42.000 --> 59:46.000
whose major theme was that
"power corrupts...

59:46.080 --> 59:50.000
and absolute power
corrupts absolutely."

59:50.080 --> 59:54.680
I felt that perhaps Mr. Mascarpone
applied Machiavelli's ideas...

59:54.760 --> 59:57.920
to his own line of work
as a mob boss.

01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:05.320
Your Honor, my next line of questioning
could take some time.

01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:08.760
It's so close to lunch, would anybody
object if we took an hour now?

01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:13.400
Any objections?

01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:15.400
One hour.

01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:19.320
Do you see this book?

01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:22.440
It's called
Bartlett's Familiar Quotations.

01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:24.440
Do you know who Lord Acton was?

01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:30.240
- Lord Acton?
- A-C-T-O-N, Acton.

01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:35.560
- No, sir.
- Well, he was English.

01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:39.760
He lived from 1834 to 1902.

01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:42.000
That's 300 years after Machiavelli.

01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:45.120
And it's right here
on page 39, it says...

01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:49.040
"Lord Acton is the author
of the quote...

01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:53.440
'Power corrupts and absolute power
corrupts absolutely."'

01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:58.480
Not Machiavelli.

01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:00.880
No further questions, Your Honor.

01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:09.000
Mr. DiNorscio?

01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:22.080
- Mr. Petraki, you was a college teacher?
- Yes.

01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:25.360
Now, in those courses
that you taught-

01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:28.000
In what was it, politics?

01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:31.320
- Machiavelli's a big deal, am I right?
- A very big deal.

01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:34.000
I mean, we're not talking about
a made guy in the Lucchese family.

01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:36.280
No, we are not.

01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:41.005
So, my question is...

01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:44.400
how could you make
a mistake like that?

01:01:45.305 --> 01:01:51.903
