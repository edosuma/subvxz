WEBVTT

00:19.310 --> 00:20.395
All loaded up?

00:26.151 --> 00:27.569
So talk to me.

00:27.652 --> 00:28.945
You ever seen the boss, man?

00:30.739 --> 00:31.906
Me neither.

00:31.990 --> 00:34.909
Not a big fan of masks and mysteries,
but he pays well, am I right?

00:37.829 --> 00:39.456
I also don't love being ignored.

00:39.956 --> 00:42.167
Two questions, no response.

00:42.584 --> 00:45.378
Consider my third query
your last chance at making this deal

00:45.462 --> 00:47.422
a sweet back and forth
between two gents.

00:49.090 --> 00:50.258
So do we have a problem?

00:54.095 --> 00:55.388
What the hell, man?

00:55.472 --> 00:57.015
You said you were down with this deal.

01:00.018 --> 01:01.269
You think this is funny?

01:16.868 --> 01:18.536
All I care about is the donor list,

01:18.912 --> 01:21.247
where my brother you
are on that list. All right?

01:21.331 --> 01:23.083
I'm need you to talk about that,
fess on up,

01:23.166 --> 01:25.919
or I'mma open up the roof and let
the rain drench your bald-ass head.

01:26.002 --> 01:28.213
I'm on it, and I'm good, okay?
Don't worry about that.

01:28.296 --> 01:30.340
-Sibling code 123.
-There is no 123.

01:30.423 --> 01:31.800
There is now, okay?

01:32.175 --> 01:35.178
Sibling code number 123,
I'm a medical professional,

01:35.261 --> 01:38.223
and I can arrange
my own kidney transplant by myself.

01:38.681 --> 01:40.141
Well, Sibling code 124,

01:40.225 --> 01:42.852
no more making up sibling codes
that can't be used more than once.

01:42.936 --> 01:46.523
-No! If you use 123, it's 123!
-No, it's over!

01:46.940 --> 01:49.150
Two victims. Roy Roman on the left,

01:49.234 --> 01:50.443
Vic Jones on the right.

01:50.527 --> 01:52.403
Each with a single
gunshot wound to the chest.

01:52.487 --> 01:53.863
And one empty briefcase.

01:54.447 --> 01:56.116
First blush, they shot each other.

01:56.616 --> 01:59.452
Second blush, it looks like our thief
did the killing and the stealing.

01:59.536 --> 02:01.329
Tire marks outside
are being processed,

02:01.412 --> 02:04.457
but I'm thinking
full-sized van, Clementi tires.

02:04.791 --> 02:06.835
Traffic cams from every direction
are being checked.

02:07.710 --> 02:09.087
Sorry, who likes blonds here?

02:09.462 --> 02:12.132
Just a random question,
just raise your hand nice and high.

02:13.383 --> 02:14.843
Actually...

02:14.926 --> 02:17.220
-I'm on a brunette tip.
-Yeah, do you really, though?

02:17.303 --> 02:18.763
Redheads are kind of my thing.

02:19.222 --> 02:21.891
Okay, so was this a party
or a crime scene?

02:22.559 --> 02:23.726
It's an abandoned warehouse.

02:23.810 --> 02:25.687
And lots of foot traffic
from every direction.

02:25.770 --> 02:27.730
All right, all hair,
all colors back to the lab

02:27.814 --> 02:28.898
with Roy and Vic here.

02:28.982 --> 02:30.441
Yeah, an aluminum briefcase

02:30.817 --> 02:32.402
with customized fingerprint entry

02:32.485 --> 02:35.613
and two dead guys wearing masks
to hide their identities.

02:39.200 --> 02:42.162
You got Roy Roman,
39, stockbroker,

02:42.245 --> 02:44.664
indicted for insider trading
in '07 and '09.

02:45.081 --> 02:47.458
Vic Jones, tip top,
clean record, no priors.

02:47.542 --> 02:49.586
All right, everyone. Listen up.

02:50.503 --> 02:52.297
Oh, no. Dragon Lady returns.

02:53.256 --> 02:55.675
Some of you already know
FBI Agent Harrows.

02:56.092 --> 02:59.470
She's gonna be working closely
with the EMPD on this warehouse case.

03:01.055 --> 03:03.391
Hold any and all
questions indefinitely.

03:03.975 --> 03:06.019
-Floor is yours.
-Thank you so much.

03:06.102 --> 03:09.856
A brief history lesson for all you
buffs here in the general pen area.

03:09.939 --> 03:13.568
Before I was a hostage negotiator,
I was in organized crime.

03:13.651 --> 03:16.321
Did I encounter
some SOB's? Yes, I did.

03:16.404 --> 03:18.573
Are there a few stragglers
I'd like to nail to the wall

03:18.656 --> 03:20.950
in a satisfying way? Yes, there are.

03:21.326 --> 03:23.703
One in particular
keeps me up at night,

03:23.786 --> 03:25.121
and I love my sleep.

03:25.538 --> 03:27.457
His name is Marcelus Vega,

03:27.540 --> 03:29.751
and I think it's time we find his ass.

03:29.834 --> 03:31.628
Marcelus has a pretty
big empire,

03:31.711 --> 03:33.671
but he's been off the grid
for a couple of years.

03:33.755 --> 03:37.675
And the wrinkle is no one has seen
this part of his body.

03:37.759 --> 03:39.385
Okay, so I'm assuming

03:39.469 --> 03:41.638
one of our victims
worked for him or what?

03:42.138 --> 03:43.431
You must be Villa.

03:44.349 --> 03:46.517
It's lovely to finally
cross paths with you.

03:47.018 --> 03:48.311
And yes, you're correct.

03:48.686 --> 03:51.272
Our dear, sweet friend, Victor,
may he rest in a place

03:51.356 --> 03:53.233
far south of here with lots of fire.

03:53.316 --> 03:56.110
Cap, this Vic Jones doesn't fit.
He's a choirboy. No record.

03:56.653 --> 03:58.821
That's exactly how Marcelus likes it.

03:58.905 --> 04:00.073
We have a double homicide,

04:00.156 --> 04:02.617
and we're pretty confident
Marcelus' hands are all over it.

04:02.700 --> 04:05.453
So I look forward
to working with all of you on this.

04:05.912 --> 04:07.121
As you were.

04:07.205 --> 04:09.123
I'm sorry, why are we trusting you?

04:09.207 --> 04:10.458
Not now, not now.

04:10.541 --> 04:13.378
I just want to ask him
'cause we're all in our pen.

04:13.461 --> 04:14.796
Why are we trusting her, Captain?

04:15.296 --> 04:18.466
Because the FBI has a vested interest.

04:19.008 --> 04:21.719
So any information you find
has to come my way.

04:21.803 --> 04:23.972
Well, I hear "vested,"
and I think personal.

04:24.347 --> 04:27.141
Now, wasn't it you who told me
that emotions get people killed?

04:27.642 --> 04:30.311
I'm just saying, I wouldn't want
anything to get in the way

04:30.395 --> 04:31.813
of bringing this guy to justice.

04:31.896 --> 04:34.107
I appreciate your concern,
I really do,

04:34.190 --> 04:36.442
and it's great to see you again.

04:38.486 --> 04:40.655
Vic has acute
pulmonary disease.

04:41.447 --> 04:42.699
Must have been a heavy smoker.

04:43.491 --> 04:44.575
Roy's mouth is dry.

04:45.159 --> 04:47.495
My guess is it's the side effect
from some kind of drug.

04:47.996 --> 04:50.581
Tox results do show at least
100 milligrams of benzodiazepine

04:50.665 --> 04:51.666
in his system.

04:52.667 --> 04:53.876
Roy was completely sedated.

04:53.960 --> 04:56.045
How does someone carry out
a deal if they're asleep?

04:58.965 --> 05:00.258
The murder was staged.

05:00.591 --> 05:01.634
Little help.

05:05.013 --> 05:07.348
I think he was placed
in a seated position like a doll,

05:07.432 --> 05:08.433
then shot.

05:08.516 --> 05:11.185
Okay, so whoever Vic thought
he was dealing with wasn't really Roy.

05:11.269 --> 05:12.270
Correct.

05:12.353 --> 05:14.439
Then we're definitely
not just looking for a thief.

05:14.522 --> 05:17.191
No, we are 100% looking
for a murderer.

05:30.204 --> 05:32.832
-You don't want to do that.
-EMPD, blow it out! Hands up!

05:32.915 --> 05:33.916
Now!

05:35.877 --> 05:36.878
Annalise?

05:37.795 --> 05:39.047
You know this guy?

05:53.895 --> 05:55.188
You want to tell me who you are?

05:55.605 --> 05:57.732
-Why you know my name?
-Pete Harmon, Beach High.

05:57.982 --> 05:58.858
I sat next to you in

05:58.941 --> 06:01.277
-Heredia's science class.
-Did I hear what he just said?

06:01.361 --> 06:03.363
I don't know, it doesn't matter.
Turn around.

06:03.446 --> 06:04.447
Drop the backpack.

06:05.782 --> 06:07.867
Hands up.
I'll tell you something, Pete,

06:08.493 --> 06:11.162
I'm a cop and you're a criminal, okay?

06:13.498 --> 06:15.833
Call this in to Slade.
Get Harrows out here ASAP.

06:15.917 --> 06:17.085
That a real question?

06:17.418 --> 06:19.003
No, just making sure
we're on the same page.

06:19.087 --> 06:20.505
Hey, what about my page? Anybody care

06:20.588 --> 06:21.589
-about my page?
-Shut up.

06:23.758 --> 06:25.551
A lot of cash you're carrying around.
Where you headed, Pete,

06:25.635 --> 06:27.053
-Beach High reunion?
-Don't do that.

06:27.345 --> 06:29.597
-Pete, what's in the crate?
-I'm pretty sure it's maple syrup.

06:29.806 --> 06:31.349
-This is funny to you?
-No, I'm serious,

06:31.432 --> 06:34.060
-Annalise--
-Don't call me that. Detective Villa,

06:34.394 --> 06:36.229
and you're under arrest. Let's go.

06:36.312 --> 06:38.272
I'll get this to Magic City,
get it tested.

06:39.440 --> 06:41.734
My guess is liquid heroin.

06:41.818 --> 06:43.653
I'm telling you, it's maple syrup!

06:46.155 --> 06:49.659
Pete Harmon, class of '03.
You played a mean tuba, right?

06:50.576 --> 06:51.911
Yeah, Chess Club captain.

06:52.328 --> 06:53.788
Don't forget valedictorian.

06:54.330 --> 06:55.873
Yeah, great speech. Inspiring.

06:55.957 --> 06:57.625
I was salutatorian.
I didn't say a word.

06:57.792 --> 06:59.710
You know, if you just look at our
high-school year book,

06:59.794 --> 07:01.295
you could at least
read the whole thing.

07:01.421 --> 07:02.296
It doesn't matter.

07:02.380 --> 07:05.842
What does matter is you were
at the scene of a double homicide

07:05.925 --> 07:08.553
ready to set fire
to a van full of evidence.

07:08.761 --> 07:10.930
So you should be worrying
less about the past

07:11.013 --> 07:12.181
and more about the future,

07:12.265 --> 07:15.351
like, do you want to spend
the rest of it in jail?

07:16.102 --> 07:17.478
There's the Annalise I remember,

07:18.146 --> 07:19.564
the bitchy prom queen.

07:19.647 --> 07:22.692
Wait, did he just say "prom queen"?
Please tell me he said "prom queen."

07:22.775 --> 07:24.235
I didn't even go to prom.

07:24.318 --> 07:25.945
But you were voted prom queen.

07:26.404 --> 07:27.780
Yep, he said "prom queen."

07:28.489 --> 07:30.616
So, we're all gonna grill her
on this later, right?

07:30.700 --> 07:31.909
-Oh, yeah.
-Oh, yeah.

07:31.993 --> 07:33.327
Good.

07:34.245 --> 07:37.039
Clearly, my words about keeping me
in the loop fell on deaf ears.

07:38.249 --> 07:40.376
-I can hear just fine.
-Almost too good, my ears.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.879
I'm partially deaf in the right.
Calcification of the drums.

07:42.962 --> 07:44.130
You want bitchy prom queen,

07:45.339 --> 07:46.382
you've got her.

07:46.883 --> 07:48.843
Yeah, I did flip through
our old yearbook,

07:48.926 --> 07:50.887
and I started to remember some things

07:50.970 --> 07:52.680
after seeing you play that

07:52.763 --> 07:54.849
big-ass tuba
with the high-school band.

07:54.932 --> 07:56.350
You were the nerdy guy,

07:56.434 --> 07:59.103
who always tried to throw
those big parties, right?

07:59.187 --> 08:01.647
Parents weren't around much,
so you tried to take advantage.

08:01.981 --> 08:04.275
Attendance wasn't great,
either, if my memory's correct--

08:04.358 --> 08:06.235
-So what?
-So I think you were desperate

08:06.319 --> 08:07.737
to hang out with the cool kids

08:08.070 --> 08:11.115
because you were so tired
of being left behind.

08:12.408 --> 08:15.077
Fell in with the wrong crowd, right?

08:15.453 --> 08:17.288
Gun makes you feel tough, doesn't it?

08:17.371 --> 08:18.664
Yes. What, no!

08:18.748 --> 08:21.501
I'm not... I look,
I would never kill anyone.

08:21.751 --> 08:22.627
But yes.

08:23.252 --> 08:24.712
After high school, I...

08:25.671 --> 08:27.340
Was tired of being pushed around.

08:27.757 --> 08:28.633
I was nobody

08:28.966 --> 08:30.218
before he took me in.

08:30.801 --> 08:34.347
He gave me a loft in Wynwood,
a nice car, an expense account.

08:34.722 --> 08:35.973
I didn't want to be weak.

08:36.432 --> 08:39.560
-and afraid anymore.
-You're talking about Marcelus Vega.

08:40.186 --> 08:41.938
Wow, Pete, you look

08:42.396 --> 08:44.106
pretty damn scared right now.

08:45.942 --> 08:48.611
-There's no chance he doesn't kill me.
-Great chance he doesn't.

08:49.070 --> 08:51.364
But you have to help me help you.

08:51.489 --> 08:52.823
What was in that briefcase?

08:53.199 --> 08:54.408
Money for the product?

08:55.535 --> 08:58.246
All I did was pick up Roy
and drop him off

08:58.329 --> 09:00.831
at the warehouse, okay?
I don't know anything else, I swear.

09:01.415 --> 09:02.542
Give me the room.

09:06.337 --> 09:08.381
Or we'll share it. Hi, Pete.
I'm Agent Harrows.

09:08.464 --> 09:11.217
I work with the FBI. I've been looking
for your boss for a long time,

09:11.300 --> 09:12.760
and you're gonna help me find him.

09:13.219 --> 09:15.054
We know Vic worked for Marcelus

09:15.137 --> 09:16.347
as a dealer.

09:16.430 --> 09:18.099
We just want to know
what he was buying.

09:18.182 --> 09:20.893
I told you, maple syrup, okay?

09:20.977 --> 09:23.229
I'm... I'm just a driver.

09:23.312 --> 09:24.522
I don't ask questions.

09:24.772 --> 09:26.691
Okay, well, you better start
giving us some answers

09:26.774 --> 09:29.193
because the truth is you're gonna
have to go through me

09:29.277 --> 09:31.028
if you want any chance
at a second life,

09:31.112 --> 09:32.446
and right now,

09:32.530 --> 09:35.825
those chances are looking
dangerously low.

09:36.492 --> 09:37.618
Think about that.

09:40.663 --> 09:43.416
You want to tell me why you just
hijacked my interrogation?

09:43.499 --> 09:44.875
I was getting to him.

09:44.959 --> 09:46.043
Let's not do this.

09:47.086 --> 09:49.380
Please forgive me if I didn't want
to waste any more time

09:49.463 --> 09:51.841
taking a stroll down memory lane.
I'm sure you look real cute

09:51.924 --> 09:53.384
in your little cheerleading uniform,

09:53.467 --> 09:56.053
but your story
is just not that interesting.

09:56.137 --> 09:59.307
What if I make our "story,"
mine and yours, really interesting?

09:59.390 --> 10:00.558
-I'm listening.
-Villa,

10:00.641 --> 10:02.184
I think this is a time-out situation.

10:02.268 --> 10:04.937
-Yeah, cool heads prevail and whatnot.
-Yeah, agreed.

10:05.271 --> 10:06.689
Come on.

10:11.068 --> 10:12.903
I think it's time
we take Pete into my office.

10:12.987 --> 10:14.947
Less cameras,
more room to get creative.

10:15.031 --> 10:16.073
Well, Agent, believe me,

10:16.157 --> 10:17.450
I'm all about getting creative,

10:17.533 --> 10:19.702
right now, Pete's gonna stay
in custody until we get

10:19.785 --> 10:21.329
the information we need, all right?

10:22.121 --> 10:23.164
Fine.

10:23.247 --> 10:24.290
Just don't be wrong,

10:24.665 --> 10:27.001
or I'll make sure you're the one
wearing the tight leash.

10:32.840 --> 10:34.342
Loose thread.

10:34.425 --> 10:35.801
Possibly from clothes.

10:36.844 --> 10:38.679
I'll have TMI add it to her list.

10:39.138 --> 10:42.224
Could I interest you
in a short stack of B-milks, Rosie?

10:42.308 --> 10:43.559
Flapjacks?

10:43.643 --> 10:47.897
This is 100% pure,
unrefined Quebecan syrup.

10:47.980 --> 10:49.899
The whole shipment's worth
over 500 grand.

10:50.316 --> 10:52.068
-But that's not all you got.
-Yes,

10:52.276 --> 10:55.863
I also found skin cells belonging
to a fellow named Mayer Monteverde.

10:56.113 --> 10:57.448
Monte...

10:57.615 --> 10:58.741
Monteverde.

10:59.700 --> 11:02.453
Got no baby, no pancakes,
and what is this,

11:02.787 --> 11:05.081
flight attendant's uniform
for an Asian lady?

11:05.414 --> 11:07.667
-You wear this?
-Hell, no!

11:08.042 --> 11:11.087
But who are we to judge
what revs engines between the sheets?

11:11.170 --> 11:13.798
Care to explain why you had
crates of this crap in your apartment?

11:13.881 --> 11:17.218
This crap is worth a lot of money
on the black market, or so I heard.

11:17.593 --> 11:19.970
Did you happen to hear anything
about dead Vic and dead Roy

11:20.054 --> 11:21.889
over a van full
of your illegal nonsense?

11:22.264 --> 11:23.099
No.

11:23.182 --> 11:26.102
Well, she forgot to tell you that
your DNA was all over the crime scene.

11:26.185 --> 11:27.687
-Yeah.
-That's not great for you.

11:27.770 --> 11:29.563
Okay, first things first,

11:29.772 --> 11:31.190
I am a stand-up guy.

11:31.357 --> 11:33.943
I may work the black market
like nobody's business,

11:34.110 --> 11:36.028
but my merchandise harms no one.

11:36.278 --> 11:37.988
Why sell drugs or weapons

11:38.072 --> 11:41.617
when maple syrup retails
for 13 times the price of crude?

11:41.701 --> 11:42.827
Keep moving your mouth.

11:42.910 --> 11:45.413
I admit it was my product
at the crime scene.

11:45.705 --> 11:48.916
But once Roy takes it off my hands,
I'm out of the way.

11:49.333 --> 11:53.671
If you're searching for a killer,
he's probably someone else's employee.

11:54.296 --> 11:55.715
Actually...

11:55.798 --> 11:58.467
We found this under
a loose floor board in your apartment.

11:58.551 --> 12:02.888
Tell me, Mayer, does Marcelus
hand those out as party favors?

12:02.972 --> 12:04.223
Must have been hell of a party,

12:04.640 --> 12:07.393
because this thing... is full.

12:10.563 --> 12:13.566
We ran several tests on the empty case
at the crime scene, and we also--

12:13.649 --> 12:15.025
Sorry, I got a flat.

12:15.901 --> 12:17.153
You know those signs that says,

12:17.236 --> 12:20.322
"Stop, severe tire damage"
or whatever? Turns out they're true.

12:21.198 --> 12:22.366
You're here now.

12:22.700 --> 12:25.077
So the case had traces of nine
unrelated chemicals,

12:25.161 --> 12:26.370
including coffee and starch.

12:26.579 --> 12:28.330
Which means I don't think
we're looking for cash.

12:28.414 --> 12:30.583
I think it's time we find out
what's inside this one.

12:31.167 --> 12:32.418
It's where I come in.

12:32.793 --> 12:33.711
Excuse me.

12:33.794 --> 12:35.463
I'm just gonna drill this out.

12:45.681 --> 12:46.724
Well, that makes no sense.

12:47.850 --> 12:50.269
Hey, doesn't anyone here
have a 100 dollar bill, anyone?

12:52.146 --> 12:53.856
-Do you have your wallet?
-I'll pretend that you're directing

12:53.939 --> 12:55.274
that question to everyone.

12:55.649 --> 12:57.151
Thank you. Okay.

13:05.326 --> 13:07.912
When I was in the FBI, I had a friend
who taught me a few things.

13:10.456 --> 13:12.625
-Will you do the honors?
-It would be my pleasure.

13:12.708 --> 13:13.834
Black light my world.

13:16.796 --> 13:19.632
Coffee and starch
are ingredients in...

13:21.592 --> 13:22.885
-Counterfeit currency.
-Yeah.

13:32.061 --> 13:33.437
That's a cool trick.
Can you do the one

13:33.521 --> 13:35.022
with the handkerchief in your sleeve?

13:36.357 --> 13:37.691
What? It's not my money.

13:37.775 --> 13:40.528
It's not your money
because it's not money at all.

13:40.611 --> 13:43.572
-Pete, it's important that you--
-Annalise, be quiet, please.

13:43.656 --> 13:44.907
I'm not finished.

13:45.658 --> 13:46.826
Not now.

13:46.909 --> 13:50.329
Bitch, I don't care if you work for
the president of the United States.

13:50.412 --> 13:51.831
You want to take this outside?

13:51.914 --> 13:53.707
-I got it.
-I don't need it. All right.

13:53.791 --> 13:55.626
Okay, 'cause I'll pop that...
Give me two...

13:55.709 --> 13:58.671
I got to admit, Marcelus has really
stepped up his game now.

13:59.088 --> 14:01.632
I mean, buying a real product
with fake money and then selling

14:01.715 --> 14:04.510
that product for real money
that's top-notch.

14:04.593 --> 14:06.804
Usually, black-market deals
are impossible to trace.

14:06.887 --> 14:08.264
I mean, he was home free

14:08.347 --> 14:10.432
till you got caught
burning the evidence.

14:10.516 --> 14:12.476
'Cause now we know
where he's buying it from

14:12.560 --> 14:15.479
and who he's trying to sell it to.
You kind of messed up his whole thing.

14:17.398 --> 14:19.483
I had no idea
any of this was going on.

14:19.900 --> 14:22.570
-You got to believe me.
-Why are you looking at him so much?

14:25.197 --> 14:27.867
Look, Pete, sometimes good people
make seriously bad decisions.

14:27.950 --> 14:30.828
I think you're one of those people.
But this is where we draw the line.

14:30.911 --> 14:32.913
On one side,
you go on living your life.

14:32.997 --> 14:34.957
On the other,
you never walk out of here again.

14:35.040 --> 14:37.126
So it's not too late
to start telling us the truth.

14:37.668 --> 14:40.838
I told you. I don't know anything.
I'm just a driver--

14:40.921 --> 14:43.507
You don't get a prize for being
the world's dumbest criminal.

14:44.216 --> 14:46.677
You're guilty, Pete. Any minute now,
we're gonna confirm that,

14:46.760 --> 14:48.804
and it's gonna be too late
for you to help yourself.

14:49.847 --> 14:51.390
Does he look like he can swim?

14:53.976 --> 14:55.853
'Cause, Pete,
you're drowning right now.

14:56.437 --> 14:58.314
The only preserver is on my boat.

15:01.400 --> 15:02.860
That was real tough to watch.

15:10.451 --> 15:11.785
What do you got for me?

15:11.869 --> 15:14.038
We analyzed the DNA
from the crime scene, and--

15:14.121 --> 15:15.915
And you might want to sit down.

15:16.790 --> 15:18.584
Each and every one
of these bad guys

15:18.667 --> 15:20.336
were in that warehouse around the time

15:20.419 --> 15:21.503
Vic and Roy were murdered.

15:21.587 --> 15:23.047
Found their hair all over the place.

15:23.130 --> 15:25.382
Which is a pretty cool trick,
considering all of them

15:25.466 --> 15:26.675
are serving time as we speak.

15:27.092 --> 15:28.510
So our crime scene was salted?

15:28.594 --> 15:31.055
Yes, with inmate hair.
Collected by prison barbers.

15:31.138 --> 15:32.640
In Daytona and Tampa and Gainesville.

15:33.891 --> 15:35.392
The killer was covering their tracks.

15:35.476 --> 15:38.646
Believe it or not, I rolled in a board
just like this once.

15:38.979 --> 15:40.439
I had a pep in my step.

15:40.773 --> 15:44.026
I thought I was this close
to taking down Marcelus.

15:44.318 --> 15:45.819
Salting, that's his M.O.

15:45.903 --> 15:48.113
Marcelus did not hire
a hit man for this.

15:48.197 --> 15:49.657
He did this murder himself.

15:50.032 --> 15:53.118
Okay, but if Marcelus is the new
king of counterfeit,

15:53.202 --> 15:54.787
why would he sabotage his own deal?

15:56.121 --> 15:57.665
That's the next part of our puzzle.

15:58.916 --> 16:00.918
I suggest you take all the pieces,

16:01.001 --> 16:03.504
dump them on the table,
and you put them together.

16:04.213 --> 16:07.299
Because I would really hate to have
to step in and take it from you.

16:10.010 --> 16:11.595
I'd love to see you try.

16:12.805 --> 16:14.139
Careful what you ask for.

16:16.433 --> 16:18.727
All right, so where does this
leave us with Pete?

16:20.145 --> 16:22.398
Vic had chronic obstructed
pulmonary disease.

16:22.481 --> 16:25.859
Analysis of these nodules reveal
that the disease was caused

16:25.943 --> 16:27.528
by airborne particles
from printer ink,

16:27.611 --> 16:29.989
a consequence of spending time
making counterfeit currency.

16:30.072 --> 16:32.032
Now, before you waste
any more of our time

16:32.116 --> 16:33.659
coming up with some stupid story,

16:33.742 --> 16:35.369
know that we unlocked Vic's cellphone.

16:35.452 --> 16:37.913
We got lots of chatter
between you two in the last few weeks,

16:37.997 --> 16:39.832
and that much talk is very unusual

16:39.915 --> 16:41.166
between Marcelus' employees.

16:41.250 --> 16:44.253
The empty briefcase from the warehouse
had a single blue strand.

16:44.336 --> 16:46.880
Care to guess where that came from?
A currency security ribbon.

16:46.964 --> 16:49.508
Which we found along with traces
of all the raw supplies

16:49.591 --> 16:52.594
and instructions needed to make
the perfect counterfeit bill.

16:52.678 --> 16:54.138
My guess, you and Vic

16:54.221 --> 16:57.266
were trying to screw over one of
the most powerful criminals in Miami

16:57.349 --> 16:59.143
by selling his recipe out
from under him.

16:59.226 --> 17:00.477
What was your cut of the deal?

17:00.561 --> 17:03.897
Come on, Pete. The money, the power,

17:03.981 --> 17:06.191
and none of it's gonna make
the in-crowd go to your party.

17:06.275 --> 17:08.527
Can you stop bringing up
the high-school thing, please?

17:08.610 --> 17:10.195
Why? It's all connected, isn't it?

17:10.279 --> 17:12.948
-You're still trying to fit in.
-I didn't want to be alone.

17:13.032 --> 17:14.950
I lost my parents, senior year, okay?

17:15.492 --> 17:17.453
Car accident. I didn't tell anyone.

17:17.536 --> 17:19.830
My uncle let me finish school
with my friends.

17:19.913 --> 17:22.041
Yeah, I did have a few friends,
thank you very much.

17:24.460 --> 17:25.878
I'm so sorry.

17:27.337 --> 17:30.549
-I had no idea.
-Yeah. There's a lot you don't know.

17:31.592 --> 17:32.926
You're right.

17:34.219 --> 17:38.015
But what I do know is your DNA
was nowhere near the crime scene.

17:38.098 --> 17:39.266
Look...

17:40.392 --> 17:41.643
I don't think you did this.

17:41.727 --> 17:42.895
But you have to help me out.

17:49.818 --> 17:52.279
Vic was pissed. Marcelus wasn't
splitting the profits fairly.

17:52.362 --> 17:54.948
He got fed up, he tried to sell
his counterfeit recipe.

17:55.032 --> 17:57.534
Then why not meet in private
instead of staging some big deal?

17:57.618 --> 17:59.328
That's the only chance
we had to get away.

17:59.411 --> 18:01.246
Marcelus is always watching.

18:01.330 --> 18:03.207
Has everyone on GPS,
guys watching guys,

18:03.290 --> 18:04.666
cameras we don't even know about.

18:06.376 --> 18:08.879
I just wanted enough money
to start my life over.

18:13.133 --> 18:14.343
I made a mistake.

18:15.177 --> 18:16.637
One you can remedy right now.

18:16.720 --> 18:19.556
Stomach contents show that
Vic's last meal was at a Cuban cafe.

18:20.933 --> 18:22.226
You want to tell us which one?

18:22.309 --> 18:23.727
No, you don't want to go there.

18:23.811 --> 18:26.814
That's where Marcelus' dealers
go to pick up the counterfeits.

18:28.482 --> 18:29.691
It's dangerous.

18:42.204 --> 18:44.957
It's for Daisie.
She says it helps my stamina.

18:45.749 --> 18:48.418
You mean, mental stamina, right?
Or I'm jumping out of the car.

18:49.711 --> 18:51.713
-Yeah, sure.
-Okay.

18:52.256 --> 18:55.717
According to Pete, Marcelus' dealers
would come to this cafe around noon.

18:56.260 --> 18:58.679
Thirty minutes later,
they would come out with a briefcase.

18:59.012 --> 19:01.056
How did they get the money?
Who did they talk to?

19:01.140 --> 19:03.517
He wasn't sure.
He said they used a secret

19:04.059 --> 19:05.936
pass-code or something. Pass the bag.

19:12.693 --> 19:14.027
Wait a minute. You got that look.

19:14.111 --> 19:17.156
There was a text message on Vic's cell
just before his last supper.

19:17.906 --> 19:19.408
Looked like gibberish.

19:19.491 --> 19:20.826
What if it wasn't?

19:24.872 --> 19:27.166
You okay? You need
some of this fake water?

19:27.249 --> 19:28.667
I'm so close.

19:29.168 --> 19:31.712
Got it! You're lucky this guy's
a World War 2 buff!

19:31.795 --> 19:33.881
This right here requires
a cypher to decode it.

19:33.964 --> 19:36.341
-It's a ROT13.
-Okay, less mystery, more password.

19:36.425 --> 19:38.302
-I'll tell you inside.
-You're not going inside.

19:38.385 --> 19:40.220
I was born to go inside.

19:41.138 --> 19:42.389
Stay here. We need cover.

19:54.610 --> 19:56.069
-Can I help you?
-Yeah.

19:56.153 --> 19:58.947
Dos pastelitos and an Americano,
por favor.

20:00.532 --> 20:03.118
If this was my operation,
the baristas would be my gatekeepers.

20:03.702 --> 20:06.330
So when ours gets back,
give him the password,

20:06.413 --> 20:08.457
maybe we get lucky
and he'll bring us a briefcase.

20:08.540 --> 20:10.083
"Americano" is the password.

20:11.919 --> 20:13.086
Kindly come with me.

20:25.474 --> 20:27.517
Americano was yesterday's word.

20:28.769 --> 20:30.395
So before I kill you,

20:30.479 --> 20:31.521
tell me...

20:34.316 --> 20:35.442
Who the hell are you?

20:40.155 --> 20:41.156
One more time.

20:41.698 --> 20:44.576
Who are you?

20:45.911 --> 20:48.538
I'm the player in this game
who's looking to diversify.

20:49.039 --> 20:51.625
And word on the street
is Marcelus is a counterfeit king.

20:52.334 --> 20:53.543
Flawless product.

20:53.627 --> 20:56.004
I'm willing to go
Rita Coolidge on this deal.

20:56.088 --> 20:58.882
Higher and higher,
two for one, real for fake.

21:01.426 --> 21:02.636
What do you think, Erin?

21:03.136 --> 21:04.429
Should I trust these guys?

21:04.513 --> 21:07.474
Let's say I like this deal
and I take you to meet Marcelus.

21:08.308 --> 21:11.061
I'm gonna need some insurance.

21:11.311 --> 21:13.730
-What, you think we're cops?
-Well, you wouldn't be the first ones

21:13.814 --> 21:16.441
dumb enough to walk in here
with some half-cocked plan.

21:17.651 --> 21:19.403
Took my first life when I was 16.

21:21.613 --> 21:23.198
Not with a gun, with a knife.

21:24.574 --> 21:27.119
I like to look a man in the eye
when he takes his last breath.

21:27.452 --> 21:29.037
It's personal, intimate,

21:29.454 --> 21:30.998
and I want him to know who killed him.

21:33.583 --> 21:35.252
I don't have to hide behind a mask.

21:38.588 --> 21:41.591
You accuse me of being a cop again,
and our little honeymoon here

21:41.675 --> 21:43.593
is gonna take a turn
towards the tragic.

21:47.681 --> 21:49.349
Don't forget you're in my world now.

21:50.142 --> 21:51.685
And all I got to do is snap,

21:51.768 --> 21:54.646
and I got five guys ready
to come in here and take you apart.

21:54.855 --> 21:56.606
Then I'll have my five fingers
around your neck

21:56.690 --> 21:58.150
before they get in here, so try me.

21:58.692 --> 22:01.153
If you guys are done measuring,
I want to talk deal.

22:07.659 --> 22:09.036
We'll talk deal,

22:10.037 --> 22:11.246
when I see the real.

22:12.372 --> 22:13.540
Now, take it off, sweetheart.

22:16.084 --> 22:18.086
As much fun as it is playing dress-up,

22:19.212 --> 22:20.839
I have a one-time offer for you.

22:22.632 --> 22:24.885
There's a dozen more briefcases
where this one came from,

22:24.968 --> 22:27.471
and if that goes well,
a dozen more, so...

22:30.265 --> 22:31.516
Relax, honey.

22:32.059 --> 22:33.602
This is a big deal.

22:33.977 --> 22:37.189
I was just doing a little logistic
gymnastics in my head.

22:40.108 --> 22:41.151
I'm in.

22:41.818 --> 22:43.070
Let's go, let's go! Come on!

22:46.448 --> 22:48.575
Send two detectives
to 165 Cornish Street.

22:48.658 --> 22:49.826
I'm gonna follow.

22:50.494 --> 22:51.995
Copy, Detective. We'll dispatch.

22:53.038 --> 22:54.623
If this thing goes wrong,
they're dead.

23:13.308 --> 23:14.559
Aren't you gonna say something?

23:21.108 --> 23:22.859
Calm and cool, just like me.

23:24.319 --> 23:25.654
I'm Marcelus Vega.

23:26.321 --> 23:28.490
Welcome to my humble abode.

23:29.825 --> 23:32.369
Forgive the car show,
but I do business where I live.

23:32.452 --> 23:35.122
And people can't be privy
to where I lay my head at night.

23:35.205 --> 23:36.832
You can't snitch
on what you don't know.

23:36.915 --> 23:38.375
Has that been a problem for you?

23:38.458 --> 23:42.712
Well, let's just say, I've learned
to keep my circle nice and tight.

23:42.796 --> 23:43.839
Spirit?

23:43.922 --> 23:46.341
No offense, but one sip of alcohol
sends my endorphins flying,

23:46.758 --> 23:48.593
and my perception and my
coordination goes.

23:48.677 --> 23:49.928
And I need to be 100%.

23:50.887 --> 23:54.724
You know, in case
you and I have a falling out.

23:57.227 --> 23:58.228
No.

23:58.770 --> 24:02.065
Me and you, we're gonna be like
brothers from different daddies.

24:02.774 --> 24:04.401
Plus, you're in my house.

24:04.484 --> 24:05.861
I don't get this place dirty.

24:09.781 --> 24:10.782
Walk.

24:27.048 --> 24:28.717
This is an impressive operation.

24:29.176 --> 24:31.970
It's taken me over a decade
to perfect the recipe.

24:33.054 --> 24:34.389
It's pristine.

24:36.433 --> 24:37.767
Feels like the real thing, right?

24:38.393 --> 24:40.896
Now smell it. Come on, have a sniff.

24:43.899 --> 24:45.150
Now it's his turn.

24:46.067 --> 24:47.152
No, I'm good.

24:47.486 --> 24:49.237
Run the greenback under your nose.

24:50.113 --> 24:51.323
I said I'm good.

24:52.949 --> 24:55.243
Inhale the sweet smell of my success.

25:02.626 --> 25:03.877
We just had a falling out.

25:04.336 --> 25:05.545
Let's go.

25:06.463 --> 25:08.006
Hornstock for the win!

25:08.089 --> 25:10.300
-I'm impressed, too.
-I appreciate it.

25:10.383 --> 25:12.177
I'm impressed that even though
you sent a pathologist in

25:12.260 --> 25:14.804
to do a cop's work,
you still came out on top.

25:14.888 --> 25:17.057
You must have a horseshoe
shoved up somewhere.

25:19.226 --> 25:20.268
I hate her.

25:21.019 --> 25:22.854
Hornstock took our prize
down to holding.

25:22.938 --> 25:25.732
Okay, everybody, pull your lines up
out of the water, because...

25:26.107 --> 25:27.317
We just caught the big fish.

25:27.400 --> 25:30.153
And you know why we just caught
the big fish? Because team work--

25:30.362 --> 25:31.821
-Say it with me, Agent Harrows.
-Come on.

25:31.905 --> 25:33.615
Wait, wait for it.

25:33.698 --> 25:36.284
Making dreams work! It makes it work.

25:36.618 --> 25:38.286
-It makes it work.
-It makes it work.

25:38.370 --> 25:40.622
Feels good to say it. It really does.

25:45.752 --> 25:47.337
-Who the hell are you?
-Howard Godfrey.

25:47.796 --> 25:49.506
-Please release my client.
-Excuse me?

25:49.965 --> 25:52.342
-Marcelus Vega.
-Get your feet off my desk.

25:52.425 --> 25:54.844
Let me tell you something about
your client. He's been charged with

25:54.928 --> 25:56.846
a list of crimes so long,
you'd fall asleep before you

25:56.930 --> 25:59.391
-reach the end.
-Let me tell you the good news.

25:59.474 --> 26:01.601
If I walk out of here
with my client today, I win.

26:01.685 --> 26:04.437
If I don't, I'll be living
here tomorrow, so I win again.

26:04.521 --> 26:06.690
And I will gut this place
down to the studs.

26:06.773 --> 26:08.942
Your office will make
for a very nice master bath.

26:09.025 --> 26:12.070
You have no shot.
Your client is wanted by the FBI.

26:12.153 --> 26:16.575
The Federal Bureau of Incompetence!
Forgive me, if I'm not soiling myself.

26:16.658 --> 26:19.035
You're in violation of my client's
Fourth Amendment rights,

26:19.119 --> 26:22.122
and you know a Frank's Hearing
is going to show someone lied.

26:22.205 --> 26:24.374
Lying is bad.
Lying gets personally sued.

26:24.457 --> 26:25.709
See, our people were in danger,

26:25.792 --> 26:27.377
and we went in.
Nothing wrong with that.

26:27.460 --> 26:29.879
No, your people
put themselves in danger

26:29.963 --> 26:31.464
when they impersonated undesirables

26:31.548 --> 26:33.592
and broke into my client's home.

26:33.675 --> 26:35.176
No warrant means

26:35.260 --> 26:37.512
they intentionally
violated the Constitution.

26:37.596 --> 26:40.140
So everything they saw,
everything my client said,

26:40.223 --> 26:42.142
none of it is admissible in court.

26:42.225 --> 26:43.602
It's as if today never happened.

26:43.685 --> 26:44.811
Unless...

26:45.061 --> 26:47.564
You are trying to lose more money!

26:47.897 --> 26:52.319
Because every minute my client
is in custody, the higher the damages.

26:52.777 --> 26:55.030
You think we're gonna
let you get away with this charade?

26:55.113 --> 26:56.906
Charade? You like games, do you?

26:56.990 --> 26:58.658
Okay, let's just play a little game.

26:58.742 --> 27:00.827
It's called, how much money
will I win for my client

27:00.910 --> 27:02.454
when I sue the city for harassment?

27:04.873 --> 27:06.916
-Sorry, Agent.
-I cannot believe this is happening.

27:07.000 --> 27:08.668
I have been looking for him for years.

27:08.752 --> 27:10.378
We did catch him in a day, so...

27:10.462 --> 27:12.130
Yeah, so maybe you should
trust us on this.

27:13.923 --> 27:15.967
Go ahead. You can meet
your client downstairs.

27:16.051 --> 27:17.636
A pleasure doing business
with you both.

27:17.719 --> 27:19.638
Although, it is hard
to call it business

27:19.721 --> 27:21.514
when it is this much fun!

27:21.598 --> 27:22.849
Don't touch me.

27:22.932 --> 27:26.102
Your mouth's saying no,
but those eyes...

27:32.192 --> 27:34.736
We have Marcelus Vega in custody,

27:34.819 --> 27:36.696
and you just gonna let him
walk out a free man?

27:36.780 --> 27:38.657
You and I both know
that little snake is right.

27:38.740 --> 27:39.824
We don't have him.

27:39.908 --> 27:41.868
Look, he's fine.
We're gonna let him go.

27:41.951 --> 27:45.038
-We're gonna put a tail on--
-"Tail"? That's your big plan, a tail?

27:45.121 --> 27:46.831
I'm not gonna let you
lose him from me!

27:46.915 --> 27:48.500
We're supposed to be a team on this.

27:48.917 --> 27:51.169
This isn't about adding
another notch to your win column.

27:51.252 --> 27:52.796
No, it's not about that.

27:53.922 --> 27:54.881
Oh, right.

27:54.964 --> 27:57.342
"The FBI has a vested interest,"
is that it?

27:58.134 --> 28:00.011
Slade, do you have
one of those people,

28:01.054 --> 28:03.181
that kind of taught you
everything that you know?

28:03.264 --> 28:06.142
Made you want to be better,
do better in every way imaginable

28:06.226 --> 28:09.854
because to let them down would be
somewhere beyond soul-crushing?

28:09.938 --> 28:11.356
Do you have one of those people?

28:12.148 --> 28:13.358
As a matter of fact, I do.

28:13.733 --> 28:16.903
That's great, because Marcelus put
a bullet in the femoral artery of mine

28:16.986 --> 28:19.030
on purpose so he could
watch him bleed out

28:19.614 --> 28:21.032
until his body went dry.

28:22.117 --> 28:24.494
I don't know if I'm gonna be able
to live with myself if I knew

28:24.577 --> 28:26.705
that I caught the son of a bitch
I had him right here,

28:26.788 --> 28:28.498
and then I just let him walk.

28:40.135 --> 28:41.344
All right, let's go.

28:44.055 --> 28:46.015
Something's not right.
The Marcelus we heard about

28:46.099 --> 28:48.768
can't be intimidated, but we did.
He can't be seen, but we saw him.

28:48.852 --> 28:50.061
So either those rumors
about Marcelus

28:50.145 --> 28:51.187
were lies or--

28:59.320 --> 29:00.488
You're gonna be fine.

29:05.118 --> 29:06.494
This wasn't Marcelus.

29:13.042 --> 29:14.085
Unis just checked in.

29:14.419 --> 29:17.005
They said the grass looked like
a barber shop at closing time.

29:17.088 --> 29:18.298
Another salted crime scene.

29:19.007 --> 29:20.008
Just like the warehouse.

29:20.091 --> 29:22.260
Captain, obviously, the guy
who just got sniped is a--

29:22.343 --> 29:23.386
Decoy.

29:23.470 --> 29:25.221
-Stop!
-Excuse me. We need to do our job.

29:25.305 --> 29:27.265
You'll do your job
with the space I'm giving you.

29:27.348 --> 29:30.018
What happened here? All these years
working with criminals,

29:30.101 --> 29:31.895
never got a little blood on your face?

29:31.978 --> 29:33.897
Speaking of our dear
departed friend over there,

29:33.980 --> 29:35.231
does he have a name?

29:36.357 --> 29:37.484
I'm sorry?

29:40.320 --> 29:41.696
Stop it! Are you crazy?

29:41.946 --> 29:44.199
She's just putting pressure
on the wound, stems the bleeding.

29:44.282 --> 29:46.743
Exactly. I want answers,
and I'm gonna get 'em

29:46.826 --> 29:48.620
'cause I got a lot more fingers
ready to help me.

29:48.703 --> 29:50.079
Okay!

29:50.663 --> 29:52.123
Okay, don't cry.

29:52.874 --> 29:53.875
Jude Manifort.

29:54.793 --> 29:55.919
Marcelus hired him.

29:56.294 --> 29:58.296
Set him up with a fake ID,
phony passport.

29:58.379 --> 30:01.382
Yeah, while you, what,
balance the books, Howard?

30:01.466 --> 30:03.927
I think, now is the time
you tell us who the real Marcelus is.

30:04.385 --> 30:05.678
I don't know. I swear!

30:05.762 --> 30:07.639
I swear. I've only spoken to him
on the phone.

30:08.056 --> 30:09.265
-Twice.
-Sure.

30:09.349 --> 30:11.476
Nobody knows who anyone
is in your organization

30:11.559 --> 30:13.102
because everyone wears a mask, right?

30:13.186 --> 30:15.605
We've looked into you,
you and your clients.

30:15.688 --> 30:17.315
It's a real who's who of who cares.

30:17.398 --> 30:19.901
Total lowlife losers
from top to bottom.

30:19.984 --> 30:22.779
Victor, our friend Pete,
we got Mayer with the crates.

30:22.862 --> 30:25.114
Yeah, and then there's that
side piece of yours, Erin.

30:25.615 --> 30:26.825
-My what?
-The girl.

30:26.908 --> 30:28.827
Maybe she was more than just
arm candy.

30:28.910 --> 30:30.161
It's man's one weakness.

30:30.578 --> 30:34.499
It's just right after his toes curl,
he gets real chatty with the secrets.

30:35.458 --> 30:36.876
I had a friend tell me that once.

30:36.960 --> 30:38.044
We'll have her picked up.

30:38.628 --> 30:40.129
See if she has some answers.

30:40.380 --> 30:43.174
Obstruction of justice. It's gonna be
real hard to practice law

30:43.258 --> 30:45.134
with that kind of charge
hanging over you.

30:45.218 --> 30:48.763
This goes way beyond
attorney/client privilege.

30:49.430 --> 30:51.558
Marcelus, he liked no one
and trusted no one.

30:52.308 --> 30:53.768
Except for one guy.

30:55.061 --> 30:56.396
Pete Harmon.

30:56.479 --> 30:57.772
Man, that guy was a genius,

30:57.856 --> 31:00.441
a rare gem and those are hard to find
in the criminal world.

31:01.150 --> 31:03.653
Marcelus, he kept him polished, close.

31:03.736 --> 31:05.280
Basically wore the kid
like a necklace.

31:05.363 --> 31:06.406
He was his eyes and ears.

31:06.489 --> 31:08.741
I spoke to Pete on behalf of Marcelus
more than anyone.

31:09.200 --> 31:11.744
Check his phone records.
The kid's got, what, 15 calls a day

31:11.828 --> 31:13.246
coming in from different numbers?

31:13.329 --> 31:15.039
He is not that popular, believe me.

31:16.040 --> 31:17.834
They're all burner phones,
all one and done.

31:18.668 --> 31:20.044
And they're all Marcelus.

31:22.088 --> 31:24.007
I'll admit, I'm impressed.

31:24.757 --> 31:26.301
The way you led us around

31:27.135 --> 31:30.305
and made it seem like you really cared
about what was going on

31:30.388 --> 31:32.056
and that your friend had died.

31:33.266 --> 31:34.642
You're a good actor.

31:35.560 --> 31:39.439
Way I see it, you're still
the same scared kid

31:39.522 --> 31:41.232
who's in way over his head

31:41.316 --> 31:44.360
and is desperate to figure
a way out of here.

31:45.653 --> 31:48.573
I mean, it's still not too late, Pete.
You have about four minutes

31:48.656 --> 31:50.241
to change your mind and start talking.

31:53.870 --> 31:55.121
Last call.

31:57.749 --> 31:58.917
Don't let your parents down.

32:00.710 --> 32:02.295
Pete's been feeding Marcelus intel

32:02.378 --> 32:04.631
since you let him take
that field trip to the lab.

32:04.714 --> 32:06.382
By now, he's got his feet up
in a hammock,

32:06.466 --> 32:08.718
he's on white-sand beaches,
and he's laughing at us.

32:08.801 --> 32:11.471
Yeah, just because some slimy lawyer
takes a shot to the shoulder

32:11.554 --> 32:14.182
and decides to come clean
doesn't mean he's telling the truth.

32:14.265 --> 32:15.433
Should I move out the way?

32:15.934 --> 32:17.143
I want to skip the excuses

32:17.226 --> 32:18.269
and the "woe is me" bit

32:18.353 --> 32:19.938
that I'm sure you have at the ready,

32:20.021 --> 32:22.315
and just tell me,
what was in it for you?

32:22.857 --> 32:24.984
The big house, the fancy clothes?

32:26.444 --> 32:29.364
I know it's all nice, but I'm not sure
I would date a fraud for it.

32:29.447 --> 32:32.200
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

32:32.283 --> 32:34.953
Honey, your guy was a decoy.
He was a fake.

32:35.995 --> 32:37.580
You never met the real Marcelus.

32:40.541 --> 32:42.126
You really didn't know?

32:42.210 --> 32:44.545
Look, I get it. Why make a fuss
when your life is easy?

32:44.629 --> 32:47.548
You're dipping in pools
while everyone around you is dying.

32:47.632 --> 32:50.677
-I didn't know all this was going on--
-So, you what?

32:51.052 --> 32:54.305
You thought this guy was the employee
of the month at Beefsteak Charlie's?

32:54.514 --> 32:56.432
Come on! Look at me!

32:56.516 --> 32:58.851
Hey, look at me. Start talking.

32:58.935 --> 33:01.688
Okay, I knew that he was into
some illegal stuff, okay,

33:01.771 --> 33:03.189
but that's all I know.

33:03.272 --> 33:04.983
I never asked questions.

33:05.650 --> 33:08.778
And everyone who did business
with Marcelus, they wore a mask.

33:09.487 --> 33:10.780
Hides behind a mask.

33:16.703 --> 33:19.247
I think I know a way for the real
Marcelus to reveal himself.

33:24.043 --> 33:25.670
You don't want anything
in that machine.

33:26.045 --> 33:27.255
Trust me.

33:28.214 --> 33:30.008
I'm actually a doctor.
Beaumont Rosewood.

33:30.591 --> 33:32.969
That's how I know that the enlarged
lymph nodes in your neck

33:33.052 --> 33:35.346
and the bags under your eyes
and the dryness in your mouth

33:35.430 --> 33:36.639
are side effects from Ambien.

33:37.348 --> 33:38.558
Been having problems sleeping?

33:39.183 --> 33:40.226
Sometimes.

33:40.309 --> 33:43.312
I know being in Marcelus' orbit
may seem like an easy existence,

33:43.396 --> 33:45.565
but it can cause damage.

33:46.190 --> 33:47.316
Yeah.

33:48.109 --> 33:50.319
I assume this bruise
on your shoulder is one of many.

33:50.403 --> 33:53.031
-I can't tell you who he is.
-You don't have to. I already know.

33:53.114 --> 33:55.867
Same way I know what pills you were
popping. I know that Pete was taking

33:55.950 --> 33:57.577
benzodiazepine for his anxiety.

33:58.286 --> 34:00.038
He's never been
comfortable in his own skin.

34:00.121 --> 34:01.622
He hides behind a persona,

34:01.706 --> 34:02.790
hides behind a mask.

34:03.332 --> 34:04.625
Makes him feel strong.

34:05.126 --> 34:06.586
But you're much stronger than he is.

34:07.920 --> 34:09.714
-And I know that you know--
-He'll kill me.

34:10.089 --> 34:11.215
You'll have protection.

34:13.342 --> 34:14.177
Please.

34:14.260 --> 34:16.637
You're the only person
that can help us solve this.

34:16.846 --> 34:18.014
You have a choice.

34:23.978 --> 34:25.313
You're making a huge mistake.

34:26.689 --> 34:28.024
Shut up!

34:28.566 --> 34:30.777
Calm down. Calm down!

34:43.539 --> 34:44.749
We got a problem.

34:49.670 --> 34:50.713
He went for my gun.

34:55.009 --> 34:57.804
He killed himself?
How are you that incompetent?

34:57.887 --> 35:00.723
How could that guy get your gun?
Where did you get your training from?

35:00.807 --> 35:02.809
I mean, my God!
Do you know what this means for us?

35:03.267 --> 35:07.105
Everything you are is, bad news.
You are nothing!

35:07.188 --> 35:09.107
This could ruin the whole case!

35:19.617 --> 35:21.619
I understand you've been
through a lot, but you're gonna

35:21.702 --> 35:23.788
-get through this.
-How do you know that?

35:23.871 --> 35:26.124
-You don't even know me.
-You're right, I don't.

35:26.207 --> 35:28.459
But I do know that
there are a lot of great people

35:28.543 --> 35:30.837
inside this building
who are gonna be able to protect you.

35:31.671 --> 35:34.340
Listen, Pete took a wrong turn that
didn't work out so well for him,

35:34.423 --> 35:37.218
but you still have time
to make things right.

35:43.766 --> 35:45.601
Cantina Cuba, 165 Cornish Street.

35:46.185 --> 35:47.270
Thank you.

35:56.529 --> 35:58.656
Good news. That little problem I had,

35:59.448 --> 36:00.658
he won't be an issue anymore.

36:00.825 --> 36:02.743
Unfortunately, it's not all
smooth sailing,

36:02.827 --> 36:05.329
especially once they discover
that what they found at the house

36:05.413 --> 36:06.497
was just a decoy.

36:06.914 --> 36:08.666
Move it immediately.

36:08.749 --> 36:11.127
I want it all out of the Vizcaya
warehouse and on the boat

36:11.210 --> 36:12.545
before I call again.

36:12.628 --> 36:14.630
Yes, to the Caymans.

36:17.550 --> 36:19.552
Driver? Where are we going?

36:19.635 --> 36:22.305
Sorry, ma'am, I just realized
you forgot something at the precinct.

36:29.312 --> 36:31.022
-Son of a--
-Bitch, right?

36:31.105 --> 36:33.774
You of all people should never
judge a book by its cover.

36:33.858 --> 36:35.401
Hornstock never shot Pete.

36:35.776 --> 36:37.361
My little story about Pete's pills,

36:37.987 --> 36:39.030
also lies.

36:39.113 --> 36:41.032
You think you're gonna
get away with this, Pete?

36:41.824 --> 36:43.159
Because I'm locked up?

36:44.493 --> 36:46.370
I have eyes everywhere.

36:46.454 --> 36:48.664
Why don't you just drop
the tough guy bit?

36:49.624 --> 36:51.083
You should be happy for yourself.

36:51.584 --> 36:52.627
Because honestly,

36:52.710 --> 36:55.338
up into the very end
you almost walked out of here.

36:55.838 --> 36:58.507
Then I was thinking,
why was Marcelus wearing mask?

36:59.342 --> 37:01.802
It's because he's afraid that
people might find out who he is?

37:02.511 --> 37:05.431
Or because she's afraid that people
won't respect or fear a woman?

37:08.809 --> 37:09.769
We both know that you

37:09.852 --> 37:11.103
don't take Ambien.

37:11.187 --> 37:14.148
Those marks on your neck
are from an allergy to polyester,

37:14.607 --> 37:16.067
which is what the mask was made of.

37:16.567 --> 37:18.778
You went to the meeting
with Vic in Roy's place,

37:19.195 --> 37:20.821
and you found out
what he was trying to do.

37:21.197 --> 37:22.740
So you had to stop it.

37:23.741 --> 37:25.701
You worked so hard
that you wouldn't let

37:25.785 --> 37:27.495
anyone just come in
and take it all from you.

37:27.578 --> 37:28.537
When we found out Roy had drugs

37:28.621 --> 37:30.915
in his system, we knew
he didn't shoot anybody.

37:33.751 --> 37:36.545
It's tough being a woman
in the crime world, so you lied.

37:36.629 --> 37:39.090
Problem was, you didn't count on
me and Pete going way back.

37:39.966 --> 37:41.259
Thought he'd be easy to frame.

37:42.218 --> 37:44.345
You know, I understand
your choices, Erin.

37:45.429 --> 37:46.597
When I was 13,

37:46.931 --> 37:49.350
my dad taught me how to knock
a guy out in one punch

37:49.433 --> 37:51.060
and run a pool hall in one hour.

37:51.394 --> 37:54.355
I could have schemed and intimidated
a lot of people just like you.

37:54.897 --> 37:56.691
But I don't wanna live behind a mask.

38:03.030 --> 38:04.699
-Cuff her real tight.
-Yes, ma'am.

38:04.782 --> 38:07.076
Up against the wall, please.
Hands behind your back.

38:09.453 --> 38:10.955
Well, I can't wait to see you later.

38:13.833 --> 38:14.959
How you want to handle this?

38:17.211 --> 38:18.963
I could just drag him
out of here right now.

38:19.505 --> 38:20.798
Villa...

38:23.467 --> 38:25.469
-I'll take a minute.
-Okay.

38:33.853 --> 38:37.857
Thanks for coming through
when it really mattered, Pete.

38:38.566 --> 38:39.775
Least I could do.

38:43.029 --> 38:44.697
Sorry, I wasn't nicer back then.

38:45.448 --> 38:46.991
If I had known that
about your parents,

38:47.074 --> 38:48.451
-I wouldn't have--
-That was...

38:48.534 --> 38:50.369
That was a long time ago, Annalise.

38:52.246 --> 38:53.748
Now I have to pay for my sins.

38:54.457 --> 38:55.875
It's not a life sentence.

38:57.043 --> 38:58.586
There's still time to make this right.

39:06.635 --> 39:07.845
Watch your head.

39:12.141 --> 39:13.684
Glad you finally hooked
your white whale.

39:13.768 --> 39:15.686
I'm just glad
you didn't blow it for me.

39:16.103 --> 39:18.230
You see how much better
it is when we work together?

39:19.982 --> 39:21.400
All right, guys, have a good night.

39:23.361 --> 39:25.488
She gets in our way
the whole investigation.

39:25.571 --> 39:28.240
And she shows up just in time
to march away with all the glory.

39:28.324 --> 39:29.450
Yeah.

39:30.242 --> 39:32.078
Yeah, at least we never
have to see her again.

39:37.083 --> 39:38.918
No better way
to celebrate a victory

39:39.001 --> 39:41.253
other than with
a tall glass of calcium

39:41.337 --> 39:43.047
mixed with a splash of Vitamin D.

39:44.215 --> 39:45.508
It's milk.

39:46.634 --> 39:47.760
Let me guess...

39:48.094 --> 39:50.262
Let's see, so Hornstock hates
coconut water,

39:50.638 --> 39:54.392
TMI still has four bald tires
on that death trap she's driving.

39:55.184 --> 39:56.644
You guys all got tested, didn't you?

39:57.395 --> 39:58.562
For my transplant?

39:59.063 --> 40:00.898
Yes, fine, okay. Just...

40:01.857 --> 40:04.193
-Just don't make a big deal about it.
-It's a big deal.

40:04.652 --> 40:05.820
Don't be mad at me.

40:07.446 --> 40:08.948
This is a grand gesture,

40:09.031 --> 40:10.991
all your friends
coming to help you out.

40:11.367 --> 40:12.660
You should be moved.

40:13.994 --> 40:15.162
I'm moved.

40:16.831 --> 40:19.041
And since it's meddling
in other people's business day,

40:19.125 --> 40:21.419
I want to know the real reason
why you didn't go to prom.

40:21.502 --> 40:23.796
And don't give me
this "Because I wasn't into it" stuff.

40:24.713 --> 40:26.841
-I want the goods.
-You want the "goods"?

40:26.924 --> 40:28.759
I want all the goods.

40:31.720 --> 40:33.055
Two nights before prom,

40:34.348 --> 40:37.268
I came home after curfew
and tried to sneak in.

40:39.812 --> 40:41.313
Instead, I...

40:43.816 --> 40:46.318
I found two guys
my dad had taken for a ride

40:47.778 --> 40:49.905
going after my mom for the money.

40:51.740 --> 40:53.159
I had to fight them off,

40:54.076 --> 40:55.369
until the cops showed up.

40:58.456 --> 41:01.083
-After that, I didn't feel like--
-It's okay, Villa.

41:05.254 --> 41:06.839
I'm sorry you had to go through that.

41:13.512 --> 41:14.472
Thank you.

41:30.529 --> 41:33.574
You see? Teamwork does
make the dream work.

41:34.825 --> 41:36.076
Enough talking.

41:42.666 --> 41:44.043
Damn, I picked the wrong job.

41:44.752 --> 41:46.754
If I could just print my salary...

41:47.546 --> 41:48.672
I don't know what I would do.

41:48.756 --> 41:51.050
I'd probably fly you to Positano

41:51.550 --> 41:53.511
and take you to Ristorante Da Giovanni

41:53.594 --> 41:55.846
overlooking the Tyrrhenian Sea
at sunset.

41:56.263 --> 41:57.932
'Cause it's like the most romantic,

41:59.725 --> 42:02.520
spot that I've ever been.

42:03.312 --> 42:04.730
But we are gonna go Dutch tonight,

42:04.813 --> 42:07.024
'cause I'm still paying off
my student loans, right?

42:07.566 --> 42:08.692
Hey, Doc, I'm listening.

42:10.110 --> 42:11.070
Just talk to me.

42:12.112 --> 42:13.364
So what does that mean?

42:18.911 --> 42:20.162
Okay, thanks for the call.

42:22.790 --> 42:26.418
I'll pay you a million fake dollars
if you tell me what he just told you.

42:27.336 --> 42:28.462
I'll tell you for free.

42:28.546 --> 42:29.588
Is it good?

42:32.925 --> 42:34.009
I have a match.
