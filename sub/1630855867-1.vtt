24:42.051 --> 24:44.183
VICTOR: I know you said
you didn't see her,

24:44.218 --> 24:46.790
but did you see any other kids
out there in the woods?

24:46.825 --> 24:48.484
(chuckles) There's kids.

24:48.519 --> 24:50.728
VICTOR:
Yeah, that's what I'm...

24:50.763 --> 24:53.456
-Tell me about them.
-(chuckling)

24:53.491 --> 24:55.062
MARK:
Kids come out there.

24:55.097 --> 24:58.898
You know, the ones, uh,
that got no place to be.

25:01.972 --> 25:04.335
-There's other kids too.
-(man laughs)

25:04.370 --> 25:07.712
Kids that don't want to be
told what to do.

25:07.747 --> 25:10.616
Kids that don't want to go home,

25:10.651 --> 25:13.619
even though they got good ones.

25:13.654 --> 25:15.478
Run off looking for things.

25:15.513 --> 25:17.249
Doing things ought not be done.

25:17.284 --> 25:20.351
No, no, that's not...
that's not my kid.

25:20.386 --> 25:23.761
Maybe a kid like that,
she don't find her mama.

25:23.796 --> 25:25.521
(laughs) Mommy. Mommy.

25:25.556 --> 25:28.161
Mommy! (laughs)

25:28.196 --> 25:30.735
Maybe, uh, find
something else instead.

25:30.770 --> 25:32.737
Mommy. Mommy.

25:48.689 --> 25:50.348
(engine shuts off)

25:53.320 --> 25:55.023
(dog barking in distance)

26:16.684 --> 26:19.014
(objects rattling)

26:20.281 --> 26:23.623
-(object clinking)
-(zipper zipping)

26:25.385 --> 26:27.022
Hello?

26:32.326 --> 26:34.227
(match strikes)

26:44.844 --> 26:47.108
Hey, Victor.
Oh, good, you're home.

26:47.143 --> 26:49.638
This is my friend Dr. Beehibe.

26:49.673 --> 26:53.180
(chanting, speaking Yoruba)

26:54.414 --> 26:56.920
STUART: It's okay. It's...
Uh, they're-they're with me.

26:56.955 --> 26:58.647
It's the...
This is a good thing.

26:58.682 --> 27:00.451
-This is...
-VICTOR: Is Angela here?

27:00.486 --> 27:02.222
No, she's not here.
This is Dr. Beehibe.

27:02.257 --> 27:04.026
-Is Angela here?
-No, no, she's not here.

27:04.061 --> 27:05.027
-This is my friend Dr. Beehibe.
-We're doing a blessing.

27:05.062 --> 27:06.358
We are bringing her back.

27:06.393 --> 27:08.030
We want to bring her back
protected.

27:08.065 --> 27:09.900
-This is okay.
-We want her to come back.

27:09.935 --> 27:11.396
STUART: She's doing
a blessing on her room.

27:11.431 --> 27:13.101
That's all,
just to keep Angela safe.

27:13.136 --> 27:15.004
I need you
to get everybody out.

27:15.039 --> 27:16.335
STUART:
Uh, ladies, come on.

27:16.370 --> 27:18.271
-VICTOR: Faster, Stu.
-Come on.

27:18.306 --> 27:20.075
Come on.

27:22.079 --> 27:24.079
Hey, pal, I was just
trying to help.

27:24.114 --> 27:26.246
-Get the fuck out.
-Okay.

27:51.141 --> 27:53.372
-(door slams)
-(thunder rumbling)

28:00.447 --> 28:03.118
STUART:
<i> When my sister was sick...</i>

28:04.055 --> 28:06.286
...and we did all we could...

28:08.191 --> 28:09.993
...for her to find relief,

28:10.028 --> 28:12.897
she had to go outside

28:12.932 --> 28:15.658
of her belief system,
outside of my beliefs.

28:15.693 --> 28:17.462
(sighs softly)

28:17.497 --> 28:18.804
We're your neighbors.

28:18.839 --> 28:21.598
And we just want
to be there for you

28:21.633 --> 28:24.172
and do anything that we can.

28:25.472 --> 28:26.779
(sharp inhale)

28:26.814 --> 28:28.814
(thunder rumbling)

28:28.849 --> 28:31.410
She doesn't have her raincoat.

28:31.445 --> 28:34.050
FARMER'S SON:
Dad, Dad, she has the fever!

28:34.085 --> 28:35.612
I just come out
and she went down!

28:35.647 --> 28:38.054
Hurry and get the kit.
I'll call Dr. Bethero.

28:38.089 --> 28:40.419
The tub and the mat.
Bring me the whole thing.

28:40.454 --> 28:42.828
-Okay. Okay.
-Hurry and get the kit.

28:42.863 --> 28:44.522
-Bring a blanket.
-Yeah.

28:44.557 --> 28:45.688
Bring a blanket, too.

28:45.723 --> 28:47.129
Blanket.

28:58.802 --> 29:01.044
(goats bleating)

29:19.559 --> 29:21.801
(frantic rummaging)

29:25.136 --> 29:27.367
(animallike squealing)

29:41.746 --> 29:43.515
Dad?

29:44.518 --> 29:45.748
Where are we?

29:45.783 --> 29:47.552
Dad!

29:47.587 --> 29:50.060
(horn honking)

29:50.095 --> 29:53.492
-(tires squealing)
-(horns honking)

30:01.667 --> 30:03.238
Hey. (panting)

30:03.273 --> 30:04.734
-Where is she? She's this way?
-She's just admitted.

30:04.769 --> 30:06.076
Come here.

30:08.344 --> 30:10.179
TONY: You are not...
You are not in trouble.

30:10.214 --> 30:11.741
MIRANDA:
You're not in trouble.

30:11.776 --> 30:13.479
-TONY: You're not grounded.
-MIRANDA: Mommy and Daddy

30:13.514 --> 30:15.316
-aren't gonna be mad at you.
-But you have to...

30:16.451 --> 30:17.648
Angela.

30:17.683 --> 30:19.023
Okay, okay, sir...

30:21.885 --> 30:24.028
VICTOR (crying):
Hey.

30:27.363 --> 30:29.968
-Are you hurt?
-Are you mad at me?

30:30.003 --> 30:32.564
No, I'm not mad at you. Uh-uh.

30:32.599 --> 30:35.072
I'm so sorry.
I lost track of time.

30:35.107 --> 30:37.239
-Angela.
-Don't worry about that.

30:37.274 --> 30:39.703
Can you tell your dad
how long you've been gone?

30:39.738 --> 30:41.177
How long?

30:41.212 --> 30:42.574
Why do you keep asking me that?

30:42.609 --> 30:44.147
-It's important.
-Why do you keep asking?

30:44.182 --> 30:45.511
It sounds like she wants to...

30:45.546 --> 30:46.875
Angela.

30:46.910 --> 30:49.449
Just tell your father
the same thing you told me.

30:49.484 --> 30:51.220
How long do you think
you were gone?

30:51.255 --> 30:53.651
I don't know, uh...

30:56.656 --> 30:58.227
A few hours?

31:02.860 --> 31:04.596
No.

31:06.204 --> 31:09.106
Baby, you've been gone
three days.

31:13.805 --> 31:15.574
(quiet chatter)

31:15.609 --> 31:17.114
DR. LOWELL:
I'm Dr. Lowell.

31:17.149 --> 31:19.116
It's very nice
to meet you today.

31:19.151 --> 31:21.316
Can you tell us anything
that you remember?

31:21.351 --> 31:22.988
We were just walking.

31:23.023 --> 31:24.253
And then it started raining.

31:24.288 --> 31:27.355
And we went into
that barn and...

31:27.390 --> 31:28.994
That's all I remember.

31:29.029 --> 31:30.259
She don't remember
too much, um...

31:30.294 --> 31:32.162
DR. LOWELL:
Okay. Okay.

31:32.197 --> 31:34.329
But, um, her-her feet.

31:34.364 --> 31:36.133
<i> Her feet look really bad.</i>

31:36.168 --> 31:38.828
DR. JAFFREE: Well, in order for
us to kind of get a better idea

31:38.863 --> 31:42.106
of what has been going on
over the past three days,

31:42.141 --> 31:43.635
we need to examine you.

31:43.670 --> 31:45.307
DR. LOWELL: Sometimes when
children deal with either

31:45.342 --> 31:47.540
significant psychological
or traumatic injuries,

31:47.575 --> 31:49.443
they can maybe have some
retrograde amnesia

31:49.478 --> 31:50.983
<i> where they may</i>
<i> not remember</i>

31:51.018 --> 31:52.314
<i> events that might</i>
<i> have happened.</i>

31:52.349 --> 31:53.216
DR. TAJ:
<i> How are you feeling, honey?</i>

31:53.251 --> 31:54.580
<i> Are you in pain?</i>

31:54.615 --> 31:55.911
I don't know.

31:55.946 --> 31:57.946
-DR. JAFFREE: Okay. Very good.
-(camera clicking)

31:57.981 --> 31:59.618
-DR. LOWELL:<i> Has she ever been</i>
<i> treated with hypnosis? -No.</i>

31:59.653 --> 32:01.554
-Ah.
-Anybody in the family have

32:01.589 --> 32:03.424
any, um, psychiatric illnesses?

32:03.459 --> 32:05.294
No. She's healthy.
She's real strong.

32:05.329 --> 32:07.032
DR. JAFFREE: So I'm gonna
take down the buttons, okay?

32:07.067 --> 32:08.825
DR. CARR: Dad, if you have any
questions at any time, just...

32:08.860 --> 32:10.398
DR. LOWELL:<i> Does she have</i>
<i> access to any medications</i>

32:10.433 --> 32:11.465
<i> -around the house?</i>
-VICTOR:<i> No.</i>

32:11.500 --> 32:13.467
-(camera clicks)
-Okay.

32:14.734 --> 32:16.437
-What's going on here?
-TONY: Hi, honey.

32:16.472 --> 32:18.109
Um, this is Dr. Lowell.

32:18.144 --> 32:19.869
-Hi, ma'am. I'm Dr. Lowell.
-Why didn't you wait on me?

32:19.904 --> 32:21.607
DR. CARR:<i> Feel free</i>
<i> to stand next to her.</i>

32:21.642 --> 32:23.510
DR. JAFFREE:<i> We'll start</i>
<i> again from the top.</i>

32:23.545 --> 32:25.380
I'm just gonna touch you here.
Get a sample of hair, okay?

32:25.415 --> 32:27.118
She's not complaining of any
pain, but she's disoriented,

32:27.153 --> 32:29.978
<i> which can happen</i>
<i> with head trauma.</i>

32:30.013 --> 32:31.485
We're just gonna
take a look over here.

32:31.520 --> 32:33.190
DR. JAFFREE: Okay, very good.
Thank you, Joe.

32:33.225 --> 32:35.951
Now we have to do one last
portion of the exam.

32:35.986 --> 32:37.425
It's a little bit
uncomfortable.

32:37.460 --> 32:39.130
These here,
these are called stirrups.

32:39.165 --> 32:40.791
And, Dad, if you're okay, this
is the more sensitive part.

32:40.826 --> 32:42.496
Just gonna change my gloves.

32:42.531 --> 32:43.992
Hey, babe, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna see you

32:44.027 --> 32:45.334
in a few minutes, okay?

32:45.369 --> 32:46.764
If at any point
you feel discomfort,

32:46.799 --> 32:48.172
please let me know.

32:48.207 --> 32:49.569
You're gonna feel
a little bit of cold jelly

32:49.604 --> 32:52.671
and lots of pressure,
but no pain, okay?

32:52.706 --> 32:54.541
Just a little bit
of pressure, okay?

32:54.576 --> 32:57.610
I'm just gonna be
taking a few samples.

32:57.645 --> 32:59.084
DR. JAFFREE:
<i> I'm looking to see</i>

32:59.119 --> 33:00.514
if your hymenal ring
is still intact.

33:00.549 --> 33:03.451
Sometimes when people are
touched inappropriately,

33:03.486 --> 33:06.091
those things can be damaged.

33:06.126 --> 33:08.258
-DR. TAJ: We are all done.
-DR. JAFFREE:<i> Here you go.</i>

33:08.293 --> 33:10.392
Yeah, you got it. Good girl.

33:14.266 --> 33:16.233
KONIK: We conducted
rigorous physical exams

33:16.268 --> 33:17.795
and cognitive interviews.

33:17.830 --> 33:19.236
There's no sign of distress,

33:19.271 --> 33:21.469
no evidence of sexual assault.

33:21.504 --> 33:24.439
Toxicology is normal.
Their stories are consistent.

33:24.474 --> 33:26.837
They both say they just went
to hang out in the woods,

33:26.872 --> 33:29.037
they got lost on the way back,
and they were afraid

33:29.072 --> 33:31.039
of getting in trouble,
so they just kept walking.

33:31.074 --> 33:33.041
Three days later, they end up
30 miles down the road

33:33.076 --> 33:36.011
in some farmer's barn with no
concept of time having passed.

33:36.046 --> 33:37.518
They met someone out there.

33:37.553 --> 33:38.948
There has to be something
they're not telling us.

33:38.983 --> 33:40.587
I don't understand,
no concept of time...

33:40.622 --> 33:42.094
KONIK: Our heads go
to complicated places

33:42.129 --> 33:43.260
when we're faced
with undefined anomalies.

33:43.295 --> 33:44.855
KATHERINE:
Mommy.

33:44.890 --> 33:46.362
KONIK: But you guys should
consider yourselves lucky.

33:46.397 --> 33:48.331
Sure, girls keep secrets,

33:48.366 --> 33:51.565
but every test is clean.

33:52.370 --> 33:54.370
Everything is perfectly normal.

33:54.405 --> 33:56.372
Can I go home now?

33:56.407 --> 33:58.308
(hand squeaking on glass)

33:58.343 --> 33:59.672
ANN:
Normally, I hate it

33:59.707 --> 34:01.641
when someone I know
turns up here,

34:01.676 --> 34:05.216
but I got to tell you,
I just about died of happiness

34:05.251 --> 34:07.713
when I saw your name
on the intake board.

34:07.748 --> 34:09.979
-(baby crying loudly)
-Now, don't you worry.

34:10.014 --> 34:14.654
Gonna have you out of here
in no time at all.

34:14.689 --> 34:17.888
I had been praying for you
night and day.

34:17.923 --> 34:19.593
(crying stops)

34:20.959 --> 34:22.629
(hand squeaking on glass)

34:24.732 --> 34:26.633
Can I go home now?

34:30.001 --> 34:31.638
VICTOR:
Okay.

34:35.776 --> 34:38.183
You know that
I love you, right?

34:39.351 --> 34:41.846
You know
you can tell me anything.

34:42.651 --> 34:45.388
What were you and Katherine
doing out there in those woods?

34:45.423 --> 34:46.917
I don't know.

34:46.952 --> 34:49.227
I wanted to find the...

34:49.262 --> 34:51.493
(sighs)

34:52.925 --> 34:55.596
I wanted to talk to Mama.

34:56.467 --> 34:58.500
Sometimes I hear her voice.

34:59.305 --> 35:01.470
She talks to me.

35:01.505 --> 35:04.638
Yeah, baby, sometimes
I hear her voice, too.

35:05.773 --> 35:08.378
-It doesn't mean...
-I wanted Katherine to hear.

35:08.413 --> 35:10.941
She reads the Bible.
She goes to church.

35:10.976 --> 35:12.844
I wanted to tell if I was crazy.

35:12.879 --> 35:15.517
-If it was really her.
-You're not crazy.

35:21.855 --> 35:23.261
You light a candle.

35:23.296 --> 35:25.296
(laughter)

35:25.331 --> 35:26.924
Clear your mind.

35:26.959 --> 35:29.124
-(distorted screams)
-Drip, drop...

35:29.159 --> 35:33.370
You stand in the trees holding
something that you love

35:33.405 --> 35:35.669
that gives you connection.

35:35.704 --> 35:39.101
You just start speaking
what the spirit says to you.

35:39.136 --> 35:41.609
What did the spirit say to you?

35:43.613 --> 35:45.844
(distorted laughter)

35:56.087 --> 35:57.856
She wasn't there.

35:57.891 --> 35:59.726
No one was.

36:00.795 --> 36:03.499
You took the scarf.
That was my connection.

36:05.767 --> 36:07.437
Okay.

36:14.347 --> 36:16.578
Leave me alone now.

36:21.486 --> 36:23.354
Yeah, of course.

Yeah.
