00:05.466 --> 00:08.083
In New York City's war on crime,

00:08.083 --> 00:11.248
the worst criminal offenders
are pursued by the detectives

00:11.248 --> 00:13.048
of the Major Case Squad.

00:13.048 --> 00:15.239
These are their stories.

00:18.586 --> 00:22.220
Your smile makeover awaits you.

00:24.301 --> 00:27.319
Oh, my god.
They're so white.

00:27.319 --> 00:29.351
Thank you.

00:53.298 --> 00:55.155
You his brother?

00:58.203 --> 00:59.590
We just had another cancellation.

00:59.590 --> 01:02.839
Don't worry about it, Mimi, please.

01:02.839 --> 01:06.009
Please.
I'll be right back.

01:13.678 --> 01:16.642
What's up, Doc?
What's going on?

01:16.905 --> 01:20.464
Four? / Guilty pleasure, Roy.
Don't tell.

01:25.312 --> 01:27.427
How could this happen to my boy?

01:27.427 --> 01:29.101
How?

01:30.656 --> 01:35.299
Who will feel my pain with me?
You? You?

01:36.224 --> 01:37.765
You?

01:37.765 --> 01:39.823
You?

01:42.261 --> 01:44.821
Honey, a patient just walked in.

01:44.821 --> 01:47.621
Yeah. Abscess. A lot of pain.

01:47.621 --> 01:50.173
If you take the car, I'll grab the train.

01:50.173 --> 01:52.131
I love you too.

03:24.039 --> 03:26.155
The laughing gas was for the patients.

03:26.155 --> 03:28.099
He never used it.

03:28.099 --> 03:31.438
- When was your last appointment?
- 7:00.

03:31.438 --> 03:34.273
Dr. Goldman walked me
to the subway at 7:30.

03:34.273 --> 03:36.363
He did every Friday, you see?

03:36.363 --> 03:38.786
Then he was going to his house
in the west hampton.

03:38.786 --> 03:41.015
Really?
The clinic was that successful?

03:41.015 --> 03:44.658
No, his Park Avenue practice.

03:44.658 --> 03:48.613
But his heart was here.
He opened it with his own money.

03:48.613 --> 03:51.022
Any problems with patients or neighbors?

03:51.022 --> 03:54.050
No. They all loved him.

03:57.340 --> 04:00.911
TV, boom box, his wallet.

04:00.911 --> 04:07.200
Even on a crash and grab,
you'd think they'd take the scrap gold.

04:07.200 --> 04:12.980
By the way, the receptionist swears
he's a saint, and not a tank addict.

04:20.430 --> 04:22.731
He's got bruises on his face.

04:22.731 --> 04:25.050
So someone...

04:25.050 --> 04:29.657
pressed this against his nose,
his mouth.

04:29.657 --> 04:34.253
They pressed hard, reduced
the oxygen and asphyxiated him.

04:34.253 --> 04:38.032
It's hard to fight back
when you're on a nitrous toot.

04:42.975 --> 04:46.404
Three loose cigarettes.
But no pack.

04:48.287 --> 04:50.402
Doc's wife's here.

04:50.402 --> 04:52.239
Moira.

05:00.587 --> 05:01.770
All right, well...

05:01.770 --> 05:04.688
I got all you need.
You need smokes and swipes.

05:05.611 --> 05:07.163
You wa... want...
You want to talk to her?

05:07.163 --> 05:10.104
I'm gonna see
if the swipes guy saw anything.

05:10.104 --> 05:13.332
Come on, now. I know you need a ride.
Everybody need a ride.

05:13.332 --> 05:16.672
Selling swipes, huh?
Right here in front of everybody.

05:16.672 --> 05:18.452
You don't even try to hide it.
I like that.

05:18.452 --> 05:20.780
And you're not talking about
running me in, right?

05:20.780 --> 05:22.660
I like that.

05:24.587 --> 05:27.730
You didn't by any chance know
Dr. Goldman, did you?

05:27.730 --> 05:31.135
Sold him a couple loosies
yesterday afternoon.

05:32.548 --> 05:37.372
This entrance here closes at 9:00.
You move on after that?

05:37.372 --> 05:41.068
Before you left,
you didn't see anybody go in that clinic?

05:41.068 --> 05:43.463
A lady. A little after 8:00.

05:43.463 --> 05:45.886
Came out before not too long.

05:45.886 --> 05:48.886
Then two teen boys, about yay high,

05:48.886 --> 05:51.493
and they went in about close to 9:00.

05:52.395 --> 05:54.230
All right, thank you.

05:55.535 --> 05:57.100
Sounds like a beautiful marriage.

05:57.100 --> 05:59.283
He was a workaholic,
she took sleeping pills,

05:59.283 --> 06:01.355
they'd kiss in the morning.

06:01.355 --> 06:04.205
He told her he had a late patient.

06:04.205 --> 06:07.208
The swipe guy saw a lady
and then two teens.

06:07.208 --> 06:10.990
Two teens getting dental work
on a Friday night?

06:10.990 --> 06:13.739
We got a hit on Goldman's credit card.

06:14.554 --> 06:16.773
Kids. Most of my customers are kids.

06:16.773 --> 06:18.031
Yeah, okay.

06:18.031 --> 06:22.182
Any chance two of them came in
when you opened the gate this morning?

06:22.182 --> 06:27.721
Oh, buying 20 pairs of $200 sneakers,
various sizes.

06:27.721 --> 06:31.097
Oh, them.
They were kind of scrawny.

06:31.097 --> 06:34.859
Which one did you think was
Dr. Norman Goldman?

06:45.148 --> 06:48.065
You wanna fit me with a size 13?

06:50.629 --> 06:52.827
Stop! Police!

06:59.967 --> 07:03.577
Son, tell them what you told me.

07:03.577 --> 07:05.057
We didn't kill no one.

07:05.057 --> 07:08.108
All right.
Eames, I'm gonna call Rikers.

07:09.467 --> 07:11.810
We saw some fat lady leave.

07:12.065 --> 07:15.808
She left the door open.
We went in after.

07:15.808 --> 07:18.614
Okay. All right.

07:19.055 --> 07:21.044
Uh...

07:23.577 --> 07:27.422
Doc was out cold. High.

07:27.422 --> 07:30.295
- We didn't touch him.
- Did you know the woman?

07:30.295 --> 07:32.609
Seen her around.

07:32.609 --> 07:33.830
Talks to herself.

07:33.830 --> 07:38.302
Talks to herself like trying to remember
something, or like... crazy?

07:38.302 --> 07:41.487
Everybody in the projects is crazy.

07:45.192 --> 07:46.777
All right, come on. Up.

07:46.777 --> 07:50.280
We'll process him
while we try to corroborate.

07:54.371 --> 07:57.536
- He's a good boy.
- No, he's not, Mrs. Matt.

07:57.536 --> 08:00.506
A good boy would have
stopped his burglary

08:00.506 --> 08:04.516
when he saw a dead body,
and called us.

08:04.516 --> 08:06.017
I hope he straightens out.

08:06.017 --> 08:09.444
Who was straightening out that dentist?

08:09.769 --> 08:11.147
Sorry, what do you mean?

08:11.147 --> 08:14.241
Means, can't mess with the kids
on Park Avenue,

08:14.241 --> 08:17.029
so he opens a clinic in Harlem.

08:17.029 --> 08:20.158
I'm surprised he wasn't killed sooner.

08:20.438 --> 08:24.438
That dentist was no saint.

08:30.592 --> 08:35.047
- You sure there's no more?
- Mr. Kettle, I swear these are all good.

08:35.047 --> 08:39.707
Look at the logo.
Five mountains, not six.

08:41.626 --> 08:45.504
You can wait up front.
I'm checking every box.

08:50.241 --> 08:52.785
Lots of goody bags for the kids.

08:52.785 --> 08:55.605
Doc hustled local stores for donations.

08:55.605 --> 08:57.595
We'll need a list of that.

08:57.595 --> 09:03.340
Why did all these moms cancel their sons'
appointments, like these on Friday?

09:03.340 --> 09:05.780
You know kids when a bug goes around.

09:05.780 --> 09:07.828
They go to the same school?

09:07.828 --> 09:10.112
No, but they all live at the Theresa projects.

09:10.112 --> 09:11.918
Maybe that's how it spread.

09:17.417 --> 09:19.732
Four doors. Four door slams.

09:19.732 --> 09:22.633
Just because I asked
about a cancelled dental appointment.

09:22.633 --> 09:26.794
Mrs. Colt was home with her son,
who really was sick with the flu.

09:26.794 --> 09:32.367
She said she was worried that what happened
to Toby Borden might happen to her boy.

09:32.668 --> 09:34.156
Borden...

09:34.156 --> 09:36.162
Yeah, Jacqueline Borden, 5k.

09:36.162 --> 09:38.865
Yeah, there were condolence cards
and flowers outside her door.

09:38.865 --> 09:40.924
Her son just died.

09:40.924 --> 09:45.319
I knocked. A woman yelled
"stop broadcasting at me,"

09:45.319 --> 09:48.634
and hurled a glass at the door.

09:52.490 --> 09:54.820
Thank you for helping us.

09:56.472 --> 09:59.583
I like the sound of your voice.

09:59.826 --> 10:03.143
You know how to address
a mother in mourning.

10:03.143 --> 10:08.135
My partner, Mrs. Eames, is here too.

10:08.854 --> 10:13.808
We know what that dentist
did to your son.

10:13.808 --> 10:17.197
Um... you can keep the chain on
if you want.

10:21.954 --> 10:24.288
Come on in, officer.

10:42.038 --> 10:44.696
Don't lie to me.

10:44.696 --> 10:48.157
You're the ones doing that radio show
about me in the basement.

10:48.157 --> 10:53.676
We did that show.
We said... we said that Mrs. Borden...

10:53.676 --> 10:56.781
that she won't hurt her children.

10:59.567 --> 11:02.919
You went to see
Dr. Goldman to confront him,

11:02.919 --> 11:07.505
because what he did,
what he got away with,

11:07.505 --> 11:10.460
is unspeakable.

11:13.399 --> 11:19.423
Toby came home from him
a week ago, drunk.

11:19.423 --> 11:24.963
I asked him,
"Did he touch you?"

11:24.963 --> 11:28.346
Toby passes out.

11:28.853 --> 11:32.942
At the ER, the doctors say it's the flu.

11:33.670 --> 11:38.911
Next day, Toby can't move his arms.

11:38.911 --> 11:41.562
I rushed him back at the ER,

11:41.562 --> 11:46.207
but oh no, now they run out of answers.

11:46.207 --> 11:48.882
Next day Toby's gone.

11:48.882 --> 11:50.870
You told the local precinct?

11:50.870 --> 11:55.697
I said, "That dentist got Toby drunk,

11:55.697 --> 11:58.765
"molested him, killed him.

11:58.765 --> 12:00.686
You need to kill that dentist."

12:00.686 --> 12:04.459
But they didn't. You did, right?
You did.

12:11.590 --> 12:15.352
Can't breathe now.

12:15.352 --> 12:17.510
I know what I'm doing.

12:17.510 --> 12:22.013
Look, I lost my mom, okay?
I lost my mother recently.

12:24.869 --> 12:28.362
Can I get a glass of water from you?

12:55.209 --> 12:58.486
I'm sorry for your loss.

13:07.249 --> 13:10.817
Captain of the five-nine says
Mrs. Borden did call about a dentist

13:10.817 --> 13:13.625
who got kids drunk
and messed with them.

13:13.625 --> 13:15.677
Cops pegged her for a loon.

13:15.677 --> 13:18.778
So she took matters into her own hands.

13:18.778 --> 13:21.439
Toby's symptoms were typical
of alcohol poisoning.

13:21.439 --> 13:23.271
Rodgers is going through his file.

13:23.271 --> 13:28.657
Desean Colt, the boy who had the flu,
he's been hospitalized.

13:28.966 --> 13:32.665
Just 'cause Jacqueline Borden is crazy
doesn't mean she's wrong.

13:32.665 --> 13:36.125
Could Goldman have
sauced up both boys?

13:37.944 --> 13:41.072
See what Desean has
to say about Dr. Goldman.

13:46.889 --> 13:49.080
Dr. Goldman didn't do anything to us.

13:49.080 --> 13:51.981
Desean, he can't hurt you now.

13:51.981 --> 13:55.171
No, miss. We did it to him.

13:55.749 --> 13:57.920
While he was showing me
how to brush,

13:57.920 --> 14:01.386
Toby took some things to get high.

14:01.907 --> 14:05.397
Like mouthwash from the cabinet?

14:06.740 --> 14:09.147
Toby said we'd get a buzz from it.

14:09.147 --> 14:12.041
He called it robotripping.

14:14.755 --> 14:17.267
Toby drank most of it?

14:17.895 --> 14:19.535
It was just you and him?

14:19.535 --> 14:23.481
And three of our friends.
They gonna be okay?

14:28.525 --> 14:31.825
Leslie, this is a health crisis.
It should have been dealt with already.

14:31.825 --> 14:34.058
I... I am with you, Jim.

14:34.058 --> 14:38.137
I got Mr. Palin to schedule
an emergency meeting for tomorrow.

14:38.137 --> 14:40.875
Oh, finally. What time?

14:41.498 --> 14:46.162
Jim... do you really think
that's a good idea?

14:46.397 --> 14:48.960
You're afraid I'm gonna blow it again, right?

14:48.960 --> 14:51.486
It's just, you know how you get when...

14:51.486 --> 14:54.054
No, no, but I'm the only one
who can spot the stuff, right?

14:54.054 --> 14:56.520
I... I'm...

15:01.998 --> 15:06.591
Look, uh, I will put you in
for a commendation.

15:06.836 --> 15:10.682
Don't forget.
There are six peaks on the logo.

15:10.682 --> 15:13.733
It should be five, there are six.

15:13.919 --> 15:16.511
I'll update you after the meeting.

15:21.875 --> 15:25.089
This is why you don't get sick
over Labor Day weekend.

15:25.089 --> 15:27.917
Public hospital,
newbie docs covering shifts.

15:27.917 --> 15:28.942
What did they miss?

15:28.942 --> 15:31.855
Well, first, Toby's high level of alcohol.

15:31.855 --> 15:35.300
Then they waited until he was paralyzed
to run a tox screen.

15:35.300 --> 15:37.707
It came back after he died,
so nobody checked it.

15:37.707 --> 15:39.860
So he wasn't killed
by alcohol poisoning?

15:39.860 --> 15:44.692
No, turns out he also had a lethal amount of
D.E.G. in his system.

15:44.692 --> 15:47.992
Diethylene glycol, AKA antifreeze.

15:47.992 --> 15:52.379
It's sometimes used illegally
as a cheap replacement sweetener.

15:52.379 --> 15:55.558
In Panama, 100 people died from
drinking cough syrup that contained it.

15:55.558 --> 15:56.638
Yeah.

15:56.638 --> 16:01.934
I checked the dentist's mouthwash,
it tested positive for D.E.G.

16:02.134 --> 16:06.864
We put area hospitals on alert,
and I contacted the FDA.

16:06.864 --> 16:08.257
Also...

16:08.257 --> 16:11.462
No sign Toby Borden was molested.

16:12.439 --> 16:13.848
Oh, man.

16:13.848 --> 16:19.749
So Mrs. Borden killed Dr. Goldman
for an unspeakable crime he didn't commit.

16:21.024 --> 16:24.819
The FDA is waiting for us...
upstairs.

16:29.184 --> 16:31.431
Are you sure they're ours?

16:31.678 --> 16:33.415
"ours"?

16:34.636 --> 16:37.542
Uh, aren't you all with the FDA?

16:37.542 --> 16:40.204
No, me and Leslie are.

16:40.204 --> 16:43.419
I'm deputy director Palin.
Atlantic division.

16:43.419 --> 16:45.088
Leslie's my number two.

16:45.088 --> 16:49.902
Mr. Schorr is the CEO of Schorr labs,
makers of SnoMint.

16:49.902 --> 16:51.946
Emergency like this,
we all work together.

16:51.946 --> 16:53.921
Marty called me about a half hour ago.

16:53.921 --> 16:55.520
I've already contacted our lab,

16:55.520 --> 17:00.347
and they've assured me
that there's no chance any D.E.G.
got into our supply chain.

17:00.347 --> 17:05.318
Uh, funny, because our lab
found levels of 4% in your mouthwash.

17:05.318 --> 17:08.362
Well... that's impossible.

17:09.247 --> 17:11.238
Captain?

17:14.275 --> 17:17.571
Mr. Schorr, how many
mountain peaks in your logo?

17:17.571 --> 17:22.194
- Uh, five.
- Yes, this logo has six.

17:24.817 --> 17:27.367
Well, that proves it's counterfeit.

17:27.367 --> 17:29.914
See, we're the victims here.

17:29.914 --> 17:34.623
Director Palin, any of your inspectors
find this counterfeit on store shelves?

17:34.623 --> 17:37.208
This is completely news to us.

17:37.208 --> 17:41.623
Our focus now is to find, confiscate,
and then find the counterfeits.

17:41.623 --> 17:45.621
We track backwards to the source,
and forward to the point of sale.

17:45.621 --> 17:48.170
We'll get this off the street.

17:48.170 --> 17:50.824
And then, of course,
you'll issue a recall.

17:52.986 --> 17:55.124
You've done good work here.

17:55.124 --> 17:57.595
But the ball is in our wheelhouse.

17:57.595 --> 18:00.307
We'll take it from here, thanks.

18:00.553 --> 18:03.543
Any news about the boys...

18:04.030 --> 18:06.300
Call immediately.

18:10.131 --> 18:14.124
Schorr, Palin...
those boys seemed chummy.

18:14.124 --> 18:15.630
Yeah.

18:15.827 --> 18:17.986
Leslie seemed like the odd man out.

18:17.986 --> 18:21.993
Like she's worried that more kids may die.

18:21.993 --> 18:24.589
Points well taken, detectives.

18:27.199 --> 18:31.226
Desean Colt. He didn't make it.

18:31.650 --> 18:34.160
Two boys dead.

18:34.160 --> 18:38.454
Find out how the mouthwash ended up
in Goldman's clinic.

18:39.447 --> 18:42.773
I got it from a jobber.
Haven't seen him since.

18:42.773 --> 18:44.453
He come back, I call.

18:44.453 --> 18:46.950
- I didn't know it was bad.
- Really?

18:46.950 --> 18:52.983
We, uh, found this letter from Dr. Goldman
thanking you for your generous donation.

18:52.983 --> 18:55.250
Ten boxes of SnoMint.

18:55.250 --> 18:56.798
I paid top dollar for it.

18:56.798 --> 19:00.777
And then Jim come
and says I can't sell any of it.

19:00.777 --> 19:04.840
He said that they were counterfeit.
Took all of my boxes.

19:04.840 --> 19:07.845
Then I found ten boxes in the basement.

19:07.845 --> 19:13.086
And you couldn't sell them,
so you donated them for the tax deduction.

19:13.086 --> 19:17.585
So this Jim,
did he say who he works for?

19:17.585 --> 19:19.883
FDA.

19:22.074 --> 19:25.415
Jim in Harlem must be Jim Kettle.

19:25.415 --> 19:28.688
He's one of my best field inspectors.

19:28.688 --> 19:31.361
Jim's sort of a lone wolf.

19:31.361 --> 19:33.364
We're gonna need to talk to him.

19:33.364 --> 19:35.847
I'll beam you his info.

19:35.847 --> 19:38.378
I've been paging him all morning.

19:38.378 --> 19:40.365
Does he have an office here?

19:40.365 --> 19:45.453
Uh... a cubicle, but he carries his active
files with him in a portable case.

19:45.453 --> 19:48.881
Leslie, the response team is meeting.

19:52.770 --> 19:55.230
She's on her way, Mr. Palin.

19:56.405 --> 20:01.001
If I hear from Jim,
I'll call you.

20:02.812 --> 20:07.224
Kettle's not answering,
and his mailbox is full.

20:08.109 --> 20:11.171
Jim Kettle, NYPD!

20:23.308 --> 20:28.329
Wanna bet Jim Kettle wasn't the only one
who knew about the tainted mouthwash?

20:32.368 --> 20:35.838
The blood from these cuts is superficial.

20:35.838 --> 20:38.549
Why did he fall?
There's nothing to trip on.

20:38.549 --> 20:40.378
An inhaler.

20:40.603 --> 20:43.034
We got an air filter here.

20:43.034 --> 20:45.864
Looks like Jim Kettle was asthmatic.

20:45.864 --> 20:50.572
So... he had an attack, and he fell.

20:50.572 --> 20:53.361
If someone killed Jim Kettle to silence him,

20:53.361 --> 20:55.520
why leave his files?

20:55.520 --> 20:59.544
I guess it depends on which files
they left, right?

21:00.567 --> 21:03.075
He got a lot of books here.

21:04.113 --> 21:06.968
There's no TV, there's no stereo.

21:06.968 --> 21:11.575
This guy's a reader.
An autodidact.

21:12.229 --> 21:16.818
Happy birthday, dad.
Jim's divorced.

21:17.154 --> 21:20.341
I guess his books keep him company.

21:21.746 --> 21:26.425
You know, he has these arranged
by the Dewey decimal system.

21:42.092 --> 21:46.166
I guess he finds peace here
in this chair.

21:47.323 --> 21:52.166
I got another inhaler.
It's a different brand.

21:53.227 --> 21:55.489
Status asthmaticus.

21:55.489 --> 21:58.145
An unstoppable asthma attack.

21:58.145 --> 22:00.483
The facial cuts were ugly,
but they didn't kill him.

22:00.483 --> 22:02.317
And his inhaler didn't help?

22:02.317 --> 22:04.616
Well, first, it wasn't his prescription.

22:04.616 --> 22:07.724
Next, the tox screen showed
no meds on board.

22:07.724 --> 22:10.895
It turned out the trigger mechanism
was defective.

22:10.895 --> 22:12.597
- Tampered with.
- No.

22:12.597 --> 22:14.878
So I checked with the FDA
and Schorr labs,

22:14.878 --> 22:16.359
there was no recall.

22:16.359 --> 22:20.320
Schorr labs, who also make SnoMint.

22:21.215 --> 22:23.968
So how hard would it be
to trigger an asthma attack?

22:23.968 --> 22:25.827
Ah, easy.

22:26.840 --> 22:30.505
Jim Kettle was allergic to cigarettes, dust,

22:30.505 --> 22:34.533
mold, pet dander, car exhaust,
and cleaning fluids.

22:34.533 --> 22:37.392
The guy was allergic to New York.

22:40.609 --> 22:43.582
So we went through Jim Kettle's files.

22:43.582 --> 22:48.764
We found dupes of all the confiscation
receipts he'd written in numerical order.

22:48.764 --> 22:52.197
One missing from the day
he confiscated the SnoMint.

22:52.197 --> 22:56.233
You're implying someone killed him
as part of a cover-up.

22:58.055 --> 23:00.189
Jim thought he was
better than everyone else.

23:00.189 --> 23:03.109
No one at the health department
likes a stick in the mud.

23:03.109 --> 23:05.892
The health department.
He inspected restaurants?

23:05.892 --> 23:07.563
That's a job with perks.

23:07.563 --> 23:09.419
Free dinners, champagne.

23:09.419 --> 23:11.503
Just for cutting restaurants some slack.

23:11.503 --> 23:14.892
But Jim wouldn't.
It made his coworkers look bad?

23:14.892 --> 23:18.493
These cats, you know...
stuffed cats.

23:18.493 --> 23:21.369
Your daughter...
She doesn't have a real cat?

23:21.369 --> 23:23.070
Jim's allergies.

23:23.070 --> 23:26.014
After we got divorced,
she could finally get a cat.

23:26.014 --> 23:29.432
But when she'd go to visit Jim,
he'd have an asthma attack.

23:29.432 --> 23:32.242
Even though we used a lint roller.

23:36.859 --> 23:38.974
Did you know about his asthma?

23:38.974 --> 23:40.520
Sure.

23:40.520 --> 23:43.759
You couldn't smoke around him
or wear perfume.

23:43.759 --> 23:47.529
Poor guy drove everybody crazy
with his allergies.

23:48.647 --> 23:52.385
You gave me your card. Twice.

23:52.385 --> 23:54.900
Why?

23:57.790 --> 24:02.806
When Palin said he didn't know
about the mouthwash,

24:02.806 --> 24:05.439
it wasn't true.

24:05.641 --> 24:07.144
Jim Kettle told him?

24:07.144 --> 24:12.132
Jim wrote a memo to Palin, cc'd me.

24:12.132 --> 24:14.855
It wasn't in his files?

24:19.603 --> 24:21.205
Then here.

24:21.205 --> 24:23.093
My copy.

24:23.093 --> 24:26.025
- I'm trusting you.
- I know.

24:29.282 --> 24:33.986
Tragic news from Scarsdale
where the SnoMint scandal has snowballed.

24:33.986 --> 24:38.089
Four fifth-graders have been admitted
to West Chester Grace Hospital

24:38.089 --> 24:41.510
after being sickened
by the tainted product.

24:43.169 --> 24:46.100
It's over.
We have to do a recall.

24:46.100 --> 24:47.717
A recall? Why?

24:47.717 --> 24:51.019
There's nothing wrong with SnoMint.

24:51.019 --> 24:52.683
You don't get it, do you?

24:52.683 --> 24:56.913
What good is having a friend at the FDA
if the friend is a complete idiot?

24:57.680 --> 25:00.515
Bing, I have done everything
I could think of.

25:00.515 --> 25:02.699
Well, Marty, that's the problem.

25:03.406 --> 25:06.179
Call my PR team.
Draft a joint press statement.

25:06.179 --> 25:08.196
Just do this.

25:13.445 --> 25:15.191
Kettle's windows were sealed.

25:15.191 --> 25:20.169
He ran air filters 24/7,
and no sign of a pet in his apartment.

25:20.169 --> 25:23.051
But his attack was triggered by cat dander.
How'd it get there?

25:23.051 --> 25:27.429
Maybe it was brought by the same person
who gave him the counterfeit inhaler.

25:27.429 --> 25:29.112
Counterfeit. Not defective?

25:29.112 --> 25:30.539
Turns out both.

25:30.539 --> 25:32.826
The lab missed it on the first pass.

25:32.826 --> 25:37.310
And get this, there were
no warnings issued by the FDA.

25:37.310 --> 25:39.787
Possible they didn't know about it?

25:40.013 --> 25:42.270
Yeah, sure, like they didn't know
about the SnoMint.

25:42.270 --> 25:48.273
Kettle wrote a memo to Palin and Leslie
ten days before his murder.

25:50.363 --> 25:53.502
"Haven't heard back
about counterfeit SnoMint.

25:53.502 --> 25:56.645
"Very worried it might contain D.E.G.

25:56.645 --> 26:00.683
Request matter be given urgent priority."

26:00.683 --> 26:03.284
A smoking gun.
You found this in Kettle's files.

26:03.284 --> 26:05.995
No, Leslie Lezard.

26:05.995 --> 26:07.793
She slipped me her copy.

26:07.793 --> 26:12.475
Well, talk to Palin and see
if he remembers Jim Kettle's memo.

26:12.475 --> 26:14.257
Guess what.

26:14.257 --> 26:16.873
Those Scarsdale kids are going to be okay.

26:16.873 --> 26:19.719
And Schorr labs is doing a recall.

26:19.719 --> 26:21.785
The counterfeits will be swept up too.

26:21.785 --> 26:23.479
It's all good.

26:23.479 --> 26:25.472
Not for Jim Kettle.

26:25.472 --> 26:29.824
He'd be alive if he didn't reach
for an inhaler that didn't work.

26:29.824 --> 26:31.713
Another Schorr knockoff.

26:31.713 --> 26:34.629
What? We confiscated those a year ago.

26:34.629 --> 26:36.721
That's funny.
There's no record of that.

26:36.721 --> 26:39.280
Right. Cause that time
we could find the point of sale,

26:39.280 --> 26:40.948
pull the product, trace the factory,

26:40.948 --> 26:44.911
and shut it down without worrying
the public. Awesome.

26:45.567 --> 26:49.647
"Thanks, team. Take a breather.
Job well done, Marty."

26:49.647 --> 26:52.922
You had a defective inhaler mounted.

26:52.922 --> 26:56.461
I gave them out for team spirit.
Our system worked.

26:56.461 --> 27:00.672
I guess... that's what you were
hoping with the SnoMint.

27:00.672 --> 27:04.889
And in order to protect Schorr again...

27:04.889 --> 27:08.551
you were willing to sit on this memo.

27:13.220 --> 27:15.923
- I never saw this.
- You sure?

27:16.368 --> 27:18.987
Then we can check your files.

27:20.023 --> 27:22.515
Stacey, please come in here.

27:22.515 --> 27:25.343
Happy to cooperate and be cooperative.

27:25.602 --> 27:29.411
Please uh... help the detective
access my files.

27:29.411 --> 27:30.972
Okay.

27:40.265 --> 27:42.235
So you got...
nothing to hide.

27:42.235 --> 27:45.030
You're a man with nothing to hide.

27:45.030 --> 27:46.660
Well, then, I'll be straight with you.

27:46.660 --> 27:48.319
Please.

27:48.576 --> 27:55.467
Someone murdered Jim Kettle
and engaged in a cover-up.

27:59.436 --> 28:04.593
How much pressure
has Bing Schorr put you under?

28:04.593 --> 28:06.581
- Bing?
- Mm-hmm.

28:06.581 --> 28:08.853
We've been buds since college.

28:08.853 --> 28:11.308
- Oh, so you can vouch for him.
- Absolutely.

28:11.308 --> 28:12.875
Okay.

28:12.875 --> 28:15.048
Where were you Tuesday night?

28:15.048 --> 28:17.751
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

28:19.219 --> 28:21.763
In my apartment.

28:21.763 --> 28:25.091
I see you have a ring.
Your wife can confirm?

28:25.091 --> 28:28.675
My family stayed in Bethesda
for the schools.

28:28.675 --> 28:31.057
Did you get yourself a cat to...

28:31.057 --> 28:34.362
You know, keep yourself company?

28:35.275 --> 28:40.670
My kids gave me whiskers
so I wouldn't be alone.

28:43.793 --> 28:46.769
Mr. Palin, she wants your shredder.

28:48.766 --> 28:50.202
Okay.

28:59.366 --> 29:02.549
Nice idea to meet on the water.

29:03.702 --> 29:05.907
I saw you talking with Marty.

29:05.907 --> 29:08.442
You don't think he killed Jim Kettle?

29:08.442 --> 29:14.348
I'm not sure that Marty would do that
to protect the agency's rep.

29:14.798 --> 29:17.540
It's not the agency.

29:18.619 --> 29:21.810
Is it Bing Schorr?
They're old friends?

29:21.810 --> 29:25.229
Bing got Marty tapped for skull and bones.

29:25.229 --> 29:28.801
That's a big deal in our world at Yale.

29:28.801 --> 29:32.591
Then he got Marty his first job,
trade association lobbyist.

29:32.591 --> 29:35.634
So he went from lobbyist
to agency watchdog?

29:35.634 --> 29:38.446
More like Bing's watchdog.

29:39.315 --> 29:42.915
So Kettle's memo...

29:42.915 --> 29:49.366
Palin showed a privileged FDA document
to his old pal?

29:49.366 --> 29:52.294
A piece of paper is not privileged.

29:52.294 --> 29:57.070
Marty and Bing,
they're the ones who are privileged.

30:02.990 --> 30:06.096
Toby's sister.
What happened?

30:06.096 --> 30:10.771
Since her mom went into Bellevue,
her grandmother was watching her.

30:10.771 --> 30:13.680
Apparently not closely enough.

30:13.680 --> 30:18.211
She found Toby's stash of SnoMint
and drank it.

30:18.211 --> 30:22.478
Grandmother didn't notice she was sick
until it was too late.

30:24.575 --> 30:28.231
I'm sorry about the poor little girl,
but you've gotten the wrong man here.

30:28.231 --> 30:29.488
Right.

30:29.488 --> 30:32.278
And you had nothing to do
with Jim Kettle's death either.

30:32.278 --> 30:37.419
Even though the pet dander from your lint brush
matches the pet dander that killed him.

30:37.419 --> 30:39.120
We worked in the same office.

30:39.120 --> 30:44.968
CSU pieced together one of Kettle's
memos from your shredder.

30:52.114 --> 30:54.798
I never saw that memo.

30:56.975 --> 31:01.796
But Leslie had summarized it for me.

31:01.796 --> 31:05.212
So you knew about the counterfeit
SnoMint before we did,

31:05.212 --> 31:06.906
and you didn't have it tested.

31:06.906 --> 31:13.268
Look, they use D.E.G.
in the mouthwash in China.

31:13.268 --> 31:15.282
No one ever gets hurt from it.

31:15.282 --> 31:18.630
When did you tell Bing about Kettle?

31:19.660 --> 31:21.574
Before we met with you here.

31:21.574 --> 31:24.702
Yeah, and that night
Kettle ended up dead.

31:26.505 --> 31:29.437
Bing used your position
to protect Schorr labs.

31:29.437 --> 31:32.316
Jim Kettle was trying to protect the public.

31:32.316 --> 31:34.594
Heck of a job, Marty.

31:39.646 --> 31:42.217
His cat's DNA may be
all over the crime scene,

31:42.217 --> 31:44.878
but Palin lacks the imagination
to do this on his own.

31:44.878 --> 31:46.598
Mr. Schorr pulls his strings.

31:46.598 --> 31:49.938
But good luck getting past his lawyers.

31:49.938 --> 31:54.172
Well, maybe Shorr has a mole.
Stacey.

31:55.704 --> 31:59.814
Lately, Mr. Palin calls
Mr. Schorr five times a day.

31:59.814 --> 32:01.160
I dial for him.

32:01.160 --> 32:04.458
Ever see anyone go into his office
when he's not there?

32:04.458 --> 32:07.233
Oh, like when Leslie forgets things?

32:07.233 --> 32:08.890
Leslie? What do you mean?

32:08.890 --> 32:12.321
A month ago,
Leslie left her PDA in his office.

32:12.321 --> 32:15.455
I ducked in.
She was looking at her salary charts.

32:15.455 --> 32:18.038
The next day she asked for a raise.

32:18.038 --> 32:20.093
Did she forget anything lately?

32:20.093 --> 32:24.687
Um... last Tuesday night, the crisis
response meeting in Mr. Palin's office.

32:24.687 --> 32:26.498
Leslie came back for her gym bag.

32:26.498 --> 32:29.636
- Did you see her take anything?
- She doesn't take.

32:29.636 --> 32:31.928
She just makes sure
she gets what she's due.

32:31.928 --> 32:34.574
Like with the car vouchers.
Agency rules.

32:34.574 --> 32:38.260
When the bosses stay past 9:00,
they can take a car service home.

32:38.260 --> 32:42.490
Leslie does email till 9:01 every night
to get a free ride.

32:42.490 --> 32:44.843
You sure that she doesn't work late?

32:45.047 --> 32:49.294
I mean... some people like to spread rumors
about whistle-blowers.

32:49.294 --> 32:50.976
Whistle-blower?

32:50.976 --> 32:52.557
Try suck-up.

32:52.557 --> 32:55.473
Leslie turns it on for the higher-ups.

32:55.473 --> 32:58.551
- Are she and Mr. Schorr friendly?
- She tries.

32:58.551 --> 32:59.555
When she's with him,

32:59.555 --> 33:03.225
she'll wear one of her sexy
power suits, the red one.

33:03.225 --> 33:06.329
She wears red
when she wants something.

33:27.861 --> 33:29.596
Anything link Leslie to Schorr?

33:29.596 --> 33:32.231
They couldn't have less in common.

33:32.231 --> 33:34.922
Schorr inherited a small family business,

33:34.922 --> 33:40.227
built it into a fortune 500 company,
and Leslie's self-made.

33:40.754 --> 33:42.716
Maybe self-invented.

33:42.716 --> 33:48.128
Her resume says that
she graduated from Yale in 1997,

33:48.128 --> 33:52.192
but Yale has no record of her.

33:52.192 --> 33:56.282
And she also claims to be a marathoner,

33:57.128 --> 34:00.954
but I checked and
she never finished a race.

34:00.954 --> 34:05.156
Okay, so she's a career fabulist.
What turns her into a killer?

34:05.156 --> 34:08.281
Well, her career arc is tied to Palin.

34:08.281 --> 34:11.510
You know, he moves up,
she moves up with him.

34:11.510 --> 34:13.817
Only this guy, he's not a leader.

34:13.817 --> 34:15.630
She knows that.

34:15.630 --> 34:17.460
I think that...

34:17.942 --> 34:23.900
That this scandal, I think it's an opportunity
that she's been waiting for.

34:23.900 --> 34:25.855
It could be.

34:25.855 --> 34:29.900
Except Schorr.
His company means everything to him.

34:29.900 --> 34:33.101
If he thought Kettle could
destroy Schorr labs,

34:33.101 --> 34:35.438
who knows what he'd do.

34:38.804 --> 34:41.706
Schorr labs?
We protected ourselves.

34:41.706 --> 34:44.753
Business schools will study
how we responded to this crisis.

34:44.753 --> 34:46.397
Well, they won't study this part.

34:46.397 --> 34:50.917
Palin told us that you had no idea
that D.E.G. counterfeits were out there.

34:50.917 --> 34:52.208
Absolutely.

34:52.208 --> 34:57.564
The thing is, Kettle knew about the counterfeits
two weeks before Toby died.

34:57.564 --> 34:58.888
Two weeks?

34:58.888 --> 35:02.233
You've never seen this?

35:09.306 --> 35:11.464
You kept this from me?

35:11.718 --> 35:15.807
I'm sorry, Mr. Schorr,
but we did discuss it.

35:19.249 --> 35:22.917
All right. Marty briefed me
on the way to one P.P.

35:22.917 --> 35:25.361
I was furious he withheld it,

35:25.361 --> 35:27.235
but the kid was already dead.

35:27.235 --> 35:29.677
There was nothing to do.

35:29.922 --> 35:32.069
Except kill Jim Kettle.

35:34.530 --> 35:38.557
You don't like successful people, do you?

35:38.557 --> 35:40.964
- Who does?
- And you don't understand them.

35:40.964 --> 35:42.593
I wouldn't kill Jim Kettle.

35:42.593 --> 35:44.849
I would have put him
in charge of quality control.

35:44.849 --> 35:47.470
You weren't worried
Jim Kettle would go public?

35:47.470 --> 35:48.781
No, I wasn't.

35:48.781 --> 35:52.584
Leslie told me she had spoken with him.
He was a team player.

35:58.155 --> 36:04.868
It... Jim Kettle would have never played ball.
He was a man of integrity.

36:13.381 --> 36:16.083
When did you decide?

36:16.432 --> 36:18.151
Excuse me?

36:18.151 --> 36:20.239
When did you decide?

36:23.286 --> 36:30.385
You know, that the SnoMint,
and Toby Borden's death, that it...

36:30.385 --> 36:33.333
You know, it wasn't a crisis.

36:33.333 --> 36:37.747
That it was, you know, your moment.

36:38.178 --> 36:40.348
How can you think this?

36:40.348 --> 36:45.263
I gave you the memo,
and I'm the whistle-blower.

36:45.973 --> 36:48.662
You... You did what?

36:51.675 --> 36:53.673
You wanna know
why you'll always be a number two?

36:53.673 --> 36:56.658
Marty may have gone too far,
but he gets loyalty.

36:56.658 --> 36:58.483
You don't.

36:58.483 --> 36:59.789
Loyalty.

36:59.789 --> 37:03.643
Loyalty? I carried
that idiot's water for seven years.

37:03.643 --> 37:06.541
She did, she... you did, didn't you?

37:09.130 --> 37:12.791
Marty can hardly speak english, right?

37:12.791 --> 37:14.799
And you'd sutured yourself to him.

37:14.799 --> 37:20.716
And somewhere along the line
you decided that he was dead weight.

37:21.613 --> 37:24.021
And that, um...

37:24.021 --> 37:28.095
that this office,
that you deserved it, not him.

37:28.793 --> 37:31.628
Yeah, your marathon picture here.

37:31.628 --> 37:36.444
Did you see this?
It's... she says "under four hours."

37:36.962 --> 37:41.943
And that's an official
Yale hat you have.

37:41.943 --> 37:43.955
You get this on the street?

37:43.955 --> 37:46.169
I got it at the reunion.

37:46.169 --> 37:51.263
No, see, we checked.
You never matriculated.

37:51.263 --> 37:54.388
Got your power jacket here.

37:55.132 --> 37:56.175
Right?

37:56.175 --> 37:59.731
No, wait. This is not your jacket.
It's full of cat hair.

37:59.731 --> 38:02.762
It's Marty's jacket.
It's got cat fur.

38:02.762 --> 38:05.870
It does match the pants he wore.

38:08.888 --> 38:10.677
The meeting was too important.

38:10.677 --> 38:15.833
I mean, you didn't want him to go
to a meeting with all this...

38:17.232 --> 38:20.422
All this cat fur.

38:22.189 --> 38:26.730
So you thought you'd convince him
it was a better idea to keep it here.

38:27.647 --> 38:29.555
He needed to be mommied, okay?

38:29.555 --> 38:31.526
Yeah, like Jim Kettle?
Did he need to be mommied?

38:31.526 --> 38:34.995
Is that why you went to him
after the meeting broke up?

38:34.995 --> 38:38.332
I went home.
It... it was late.

38:38.332 --> 38:40.469
Did you?

38:42.995 --> 38:46.654
Stacey, could you come in here
for a sec, please?

38:46.654 --> 38:48.935
Why are you asking her?
She doesn't know anything.

38:48.935 --> 38:50.422
She's a G2.

38:50.422 --> 38:55.791
Could you put those expense
vouchers up on the screen, please?

38:57.569 --> 39:00.377
- There you go.
- Thank you, Stacey.

39:00.377 --> 39:05.012
So Leslie, most nights you work late.
You take a car service home.

39:05.012 --> 39:08.870
Right. That's agency policy.

39:08.870 --> 39:13.888
Then why didn't you take a car service home
after the crisis meeting?

39:13.888 --> 39:17.233
It was... I took a cab.
It was easier.

39:17.233 --> 39:18.739
Well, that's strange,

39:18.739 --> 39:22.611
because that's the only night
this month that you did.

39:22.611 --> 39:26.318
You didn't take the car
'cause you didn't go home.

39:26.318 --> 39:27.538
You went to Jim's.

39:27.538 --> 39:29.386
No, it... it was Marty.

39:29.386 --> 39:33.369
Come on, you said it yourself.
Marty... he's an idiot.

39:33.369 --> 39:37.961
The guy would never, ever think of...
killing Jim Kettle with cat dander.

39:37.961 --> 39:42.279
How would that kill him?
Jim carries an inhaler.

39:44.086 --> 39:47.469
Well, what a nice gift
to give his whole team.

39:47.469 --> 39:51.722
We did our job well.
We covered Mr. Schorr's ass.

39:52.545 --> 39:58.676
Yeah. And you got all the defective
counterfeit inhalers off the shelves

39:58.676 --> 40:02.909
and protected the public and Schorr labs.

40:02.909 --> 40:07.379
You know, Marty,
he used the defective inhalers...

40:08.496 --> 40:11.425
in the keepsake.

40:11.425 --> 40:14.199
This one works.

40:18.565 --> 40:24.174
You took the defective inhaler
and you brought it to Jim's.

40:24.174 --> 40:26.382
And you triggered his attack,

40:26.382 --> 40:30.599
and you gave him an inhaler
that you knew would not work.

40:30.599 --> 40:32.172
Triggered the attack?

40:32.172 --> 40:34.354
You... you're saying
Kettle was allergic to me?

40:34.354 --> 40:37.391
No, not to you.
To the jacket.

40:37.391 --> 40:39.514
You wore it in his apartment.

40:39.514 --> 40:43.514
And your DNA must be all over it.

40:43.764 --> 40:45.944
Those kids were stupid.

40:45.944 --> 40:48.659
It was mouthwash, for god's sake.
You swoosh and spit.

40:48.659 --> 40:52.499
Nobody could have anticipated
that they would drink it.

40:52.707 --> 40:55.047
Those kids were stupid.

40:56.445 --> 40:58.043
Toby Borden is dead.

40:58.043 --> 41:03.274
His little sister...
Lissa, she's dead.

41:03.274 --> 41:06.465
Desean Colt, too.

41:06.465 --> 41:12.225
Jim Kettle anticipated it.
He told you that people could die.

41:12.225 --> 41:15.620
And you saw it as a career opportunity.

41:15.620 --> 41:17.828
You killed Jim

41:17.828 --> 41:20.953
and you set up Marty.

41:20.953 --> 41:24.985
And you positioned yourself
as the whistle-blower.

41:24.985 --> 41:29.428
Leslie Lezard, you're under arrest
for the murder of Jim Kettle.

41:29.428 --> 41:31.160
Good research.

41:31.160 --> 41:34.220
I researched you too.
You think you're brilliant.

41:34.220 --> 41:36.983
You will never make senior partner.

41:36.983 --> 41:39.185
- You could be right.
- And you'll never make captain either.

41:39.185 --> 41:42.469
You'll be tainted by him.
He's insubordinate, unstable.

41:42.469 --> 41:46.577
How long before he loses it
and takes you down with him?

41:53.790 --> 41:58.990
You worry about what she said,
that your career is tainted by me?

41:58.990 --> 42:02.573
- I used to.
- And now?

42:04.891 --> 42:06.873
It's too late.
