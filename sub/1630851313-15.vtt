00:01.727 --> 00:04.061
<i> SELENE:</i>
<i> Hey, everyone,</i>
<i> it's your girl Selene.</i>

00:04.196 --> 00:06.154
As you guys can see,
I am back in La-La Land.

00:06.173 --> 00:07.748
I actually just flew in
on the PJ today,

00:07.842 --> 00:09.324
because...

00:09.343 --> 00:12.160
I just got the keys
to my brand-new house!

00:12.179 --> 00:14.588
Ah, it's so amazing. Look at it.

00:14.682 --> 00:15.997
It's like a Barbie dreamhouse,

00:16.017 --> 00:17.499
which is literally
what I told my realtor.

00:17.576 --> 00:19.501
How do they do their job
like that, you know?

00:19.520 --> 00:21.428
Without further ado,

00:21.580 --> 00:23.355
let's go inside.

00:25.842 --> 00:27.100
Ah, you guys.

00:27.253 --> 00:28.727
Okay, wait.
I see another question.

00:28.879 --> 00:29.862
"Why were you
on a Cessna today?

00:30.013 --> 00:31.363
I thought you had a G5?"

00:31.532 --> 00:34.366
You guys, I take the big plane
when I'm going to, like, Europe.

00:34.518 --> 00:36.902
Today I was flying domestic,
so I took the little plane

00:37.129 --> 00:38.537
to be more environmental.

00:38.688 --> 00:39.780
Okay, plane police?

00:39.932 --> 00:43.024
(gasps) And this is the kitchen.

00:43.118 --> 00:45.193
No, I won't be doing
any cooking in here,

00:45.212 --> 00:46.879
but my personal chef has
already signed off,

00:47.030 --> 00:49.289
and they love their new office.

00:49.441 --> 00:52.200
And then, while the chef is
cooking up the gourmet du jour,

00:52.219 --> 00:54.887
I will be spending all my time
our here.

00:55.114 --> 00:58.373
Ah. Would you look at this view?

00:58.392 --> 01:00.375
Honestly,
better than the Observatory

01:00.394 --> 01:02.786
because nobody's here
begging me for a selfie.

01:02.805 --> 01:04.805
-(chuckles) JK. Love you guys.
-(construction rattling)

01:04.899 --> 01:07.307
Oh, sorry about that.

01:07.401 --> 01:09.293
That's just some construction
I'm doing on the garage.

01:09.311 --> 01:11.295
Got to make some room
for my new ride.

01:11.313 --> 01:13.980
I'm thinking
a blacked-out McLaren.

01:14.133 --> 01:15.649
Let me know what you guys think
in the comments.

01:15.801 --> 01:17.725
(construction noise continues)

01:17.745 --> 01:20.245
This is the primary.

01:20.397 --> 01:22.989
But the real, real reason

01:23.142 --> 01:24.991
why I wanted this house
in particular...

01:25.160 --> 01:27.994
Okay, wait for it.
Wait for it.

01:28.089 --> 01:31.465
(gasps)
My own personal sauna.

01:32.167 --> 01:33.741
Come on in. (chuckles)

01:33.761 --> 01:35.076
In Scandinavia,

01:35.170 --> 01:36.578
people use saunas
all the time.

01:36.597 --> 01:39.747
Like, they use them literally
if they want to unwind,

01:39.767 --> 01:41.916
or just, like, relax.

01:41.936 --> 01:43.844
I guess they're
really stressed there.

01:43.996 --> 01:45.395
Okay, check this out.

01:46.256 --> 01:48.440
I have a cute little ladle.

01:48.667 --> 01:49.591
See you ladle. (chuckles)

01:49.685 --> 01:51.092
(gasps)

01:51.170 --> 01:53.946
Oh, my God. So fire, y'all.

01:54.173 --> 01:56.532
-So cute.
-(rumbling)

01:57.601 --> 01:58.450
Oh.

01:58.677 --> 01:59.860
Sorry.

02:00.012 --> 02:01.102
I told them to keep it down
while I'm working.

02:01.122 --> 02:02.362
I might need to have
a little word

02:02.514 --> 02:04.623
with the construction guys
or whatever.

02:04.774 --> 02:06.774
-(rumbling)
-What the hell?

02:06.794 --> 02:08.685
That's not okay.

02:08.704 --> 02:10.462
-Um...
-(rumbling)

02:11.615 --> 02:12.614
Oh, my...

02:12.708 --> 02:13.799
I'm gonna check on that.

02:13.950 --> 02:15.509
(screams)

02:23.535 --> 02:25.202
<i> (over phone):</i>
<i> Her name's Selene.</i>

02:25.220 --> 02:26.961
<i> We were taking a tour</i>
<i> of her new house,</i>

02:26.981 --> 02:28.647
<i> and something happened when</i>
<i> she was showing us the sauna.</i>

02:28.798 --> 02:30.223
<i> She fell and hit her head</i>

02:30.376 --> 02:32.151
<i> and she's not moving.</i>
<i> You have to send help.</i>

02:32.302 --> 02:33.819
Okay, we'll be out there
as soon as we can.

02:33.970 --> 02:35.654
-What's the address?
<i> -I don't know.</i>

02:35.839 --> 02:37.156
<i> I just saw it on the Internet.</i>

02:40.810 --> 02:43.311
Sue, we've gotten six other
calls about this girl so far,

02:43.405 --> 02:45.739
but no address or last name,
just Selene.

02:45.891 --> 02:47.741
We're getting calls
from Maine, Arizona, Colorado,

02:47.893 --> 02:49.668
all of them just as clueless.

02:49.895 --> 02:51.411
So everyone's seen this video,

02:51.563 --> 02:54.673
but no one can tell us
where she is or-or who she is?

02:54.824 --> 02:55.823
I looked her up on Instagram.

02:55.843 --> 02:57.083
She was in the middle of touring

02:57.178 --> 02:59.160
her new Brentwood mansion
when she fell.

02:59.180 --> 03:00.754
She's a big luxury influencer.

03:00.848 --> 03:02.497
-A what?
-A luxury influencer.

03:02.516 --> 03:03.831
It's her job to be rich.

03:03.926 --> 03:05.575
-And that's it?
-Pretty much.

03:05.669 --> 03:07.594
Eddie, let's tweet out a picture
of that girl from the sauna,

03:07.763 --> 03:09.913
see if anyone can ID her.

03:09.932 --> 03:12.840
Uh... what is her name?

03:12.860 --> 03:14.601
Selene. I just sent you
her profile.

03:14.753 --> 03:16.528
Selene. Got it.

03:16.721 --> 03:19.013
Adding to tweet. Sent.

03:19.033 --> 03:20.440
You need a hand
looking through her socials?

03:20.592 --> 03:22.442
Well, it can't hurt
to have another pair of eyes.

03:22.536 --> 03:25.704
So far, I can tell
it's a house in Brentwood.

03:25.931 --> 03:27.188
You can see The Getty
from the pool,

03:27.282 --> 03:29.266
which means it's on the opposite
side of the street.

03:29.284 --> 03:31.192
So it's on the southern side
of whatever street it's on.

03:31.286 --> 03:33.437
Try looking through
a topographical map.

03:33.455 --> 03:35.288
Looks like the house is
on a ridge.

03:35.365 --> 03:37.198
MAY:
All these houses are on ridges.

03:37.218 --> 03:38.458
-It's impossible
to tell them apart.
-EDDIE: Got it.

03:38.610 --> 03:40.535
Curb number,
right across the street.

03:40.629 --> 03:42.279
-8497.
-(typing)

03:42.297 --> 03:44.205
MAY:
Okay, now we just need a street.

03:44.299 --> 03:46.040
EDDIE: Boom. Looks like
I'm going viral.

03:46.060 --> 03:47.875
She does have
over a million followers.

03:47.895 --> 03:51.137
-And one of them claiming
to be her mother.
-Wait, what?

03:51.232 --> 03:53.123
<i> HANNAH:</i>
<i> They're saying online</i>

03:53.141 --> 03:54.808
that she's hurt.
I-Is she hurt?

03:54.960 --> 03:56.068
We can't tell from the stream.

03:56.219 --> 03:58.070
They're also saying
that she's in Brentwood.

03:58.297 --> 03:59.463
Any idea where
she might have gone?

03:59.481 --> 04:00.981
She doesn't know anyone
in Brentwood.

04:01.133 --> 04:02.724
Or, at least,
I didn't think she did.

04:02.818 --> 04:04.058
She's supposed to be at school,
up in Santa Barbara.

04:04.227 --> 04:06.653
But that account,
it goes so far back,

04:06.805 --> 04:09.564
and-and she's been everywhere.

04:09.583 --> 04:11.825
-This isn't her.
-Clay, you have to stop.

04:11.994 --> 04:13.477
This is not my daughter.

04:13.495 --> 04:15.903
This is my daughter.

04:15.998 --> 04:17.497
Not Selene. Rebecca.

04:17.649 --> 04:19.424
We see her almost
every other weekend.

04:19.501 --> 04:21.985
And, clearly, she's been lying
to us every other weekend.

04:22.078 --> 04:24.004
She's made a mistake,
and whatever happens next,

04:24.156 --> 04:26.990
she's going to need her parents.

04:27.083 --> 04:28.825
What do we do?

04:28.918 --> 04:29.935
We have no idea where she is.

04:30.012 --> 04:31.828
You said she was up at school.

04:31.921 --> 04:33.497
-How would she have gotten
down here?
-HANNAH: She drives.

04:33.590 --> 04:35.332
We bought her a car
when she left for college.

04:35.425 --> 04:36.833
We didn't find a car
in her name.

04:36.852 --> 04:38.668
Because it's registered in ours.

04:39.929 --> 04:42.188
-(sirens wailing)
<i> -MAY: You're looking</i>

BOBBY:
Dispatch, we found it.

05:17.059 --> 05:18.875
Hey, you guys working
on this house?

05:18.894 --> 05:20.152
We need to get inside.

05:20.303 --> 05:21.636
There's a girl trapped
in the sauna.

05:21.730 --> 05:22.970
What girl? This place is empty.

05:23.065 --> 05:24.881
We've been here all day,
working on the foundation.

05:24.974 --> 05:25.973
Can you let us inside to check?

05:25.993 --> 05:28.452
Yeah. Sauna's through that door.

05:32.333 --> 05:34.074
-Lucy, cut these hinges.
-(saw whirring)

05:34.226 --> 05:35.316
We're gonna have access
in a second.

05:35.336 --> 05:36.743
BUCK:
Okay, Cap. Power and gas is off.

05:36.837 --> 05:39.046
All right,
let's get that door off.

05:39.581 --> 05:41.965
(grunting)

05:45.662 --> 05:47.346
(sizzling)

05:47.497 --> 05:49.014
Pulse is steady.

05:49.241 --> 05:50.924
Pretty severe contusion
on her head.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.576
Most likely looking at
a concussion.

05:52.594 --> 05:55.595
Third-degree burns,
45% of her face.

05:55.689 --> 05:57.097
We're gonna have to debride

05:57.249 --> 05:57.856
to start separating the flesh
from the rocks.

05:58.007 --> 05:59.340
Saline ready.

05:59.509 --> 06:00.525
All right.

06:01.845 --> 06:04.863
-(sizzling, hissing)
-Oh, my God.

06:05.090 --> 06:07.032
I'm gonna try to pull her off.

06:10.186 --> 06:11.536
-Oh, God.
-HEN: H-Hold it,

06:11.763 --> 06:13.020
hold it, hold it right there.

06:13.040 --> 06:14.998
(Chimney sighs)

06:16.359 --> 06:18.377
All right,
we can cut the rest free.

06:18.453 --> 06:19.527
Okay.

06:19.621 --> 06:20.995
Dispatch,
notify First Presbyterian

06:21.106 --> 06:22.272
we're ten minutes out.

06:22.290 --> 06:23.882
Have the specialty burn unit
standing by.

06:24.033 --> 06:26.343
(indistinct chatter over radio)

06:29.114 --> 06:31.131
MAY: She's on her way
to the burn unit now.

06:31.225 --> 06:34.184
High price to pay
for living a fake life.

06:35.378 --> 06:37.062
You think her regular life
was that bad?

06:37.289 --> 06:39.564
Maybe she felt like
she was missing out

06:39.716 --> 06:40.715
on a life she could have had,

06:40.734 --> 06:42.550
if she'd been born someone else

06:42.569 --> 06:43.902
or made different choices.

06:44.053 --> 06:46.196
Don't you wonder
about stuff like that?

06:47.223 --> 06:48.389
Not really.

06:48.634 --> 06:52.302
Well, some people--
most people, other than you--

06:52.320 --> 06:55.247
worry that they're not getting
the full experience.

06:55.323 --> 06:58.375
The unknown is scary.
You know, FOMO. (scoffs)

06:59.995 --> 07:02.178
Fear of missing out.

07:02.238 --> 07:03.755
You make it sound
like a sickness.

07:03.907 --> 07:07.217
-I guess it kind of is.
-Yeah.

07:13.325 --> 07:14.841
<i> -(knocking)</i>
<i> -(Jee-Yun crying)</i>

07:14.993 --> 07:16.176
-Okay.
-Uh-oh.

07:16.328 --> 07:17.752
You were right about
the juice box.

07:17.846 --> 07:19.846
-Told you so.
-Yes.

07:19.998 --> 07:21.181
She likes to squeeze that thing
like it's a stress ball.

07:21.275 --> 07:22.757
Don't you?

07:22.776 --> 07:25.110
She didn't even care that
she was covered in fruit punch.

07:25.261 --> 07:26.503
Poor little baby.

07:26.596 --> 07:27.929
Oh, baby, it's okay.

07:27.948 --> 07:29.339
Oh, there you go.

07:29.432 --> 07:31.116
-There you go, honey.
There you go.
-Hey.

07:31.343 --> 07:33.526
What's this?
Why is her baby box out?

07:33.620 --> 07:37.013
Uh, I just found some stuff
I brought back from Boston.

07:37.032 --> 07:38.606
I want to put it in there.

07:38.700 --> 07:41.209
(Jee-Yun cooing)

07:44.465 --> 07:46.781
Wow. (sighs)

07:46.875 --> 07:48.208
That's a lot of memories.

07:48.360 --> 07:50.802
Yeah, you should see
the camera roll on my phone.

07:50.954 --> 07:52.304
It's like a flip-book.

07:52.473 --> 07:54.714
Watch the baby grow,
right before your eyes.

07:54.866 --> 07:56.391
(Jee-Yun cooing)

07:57.811 --> 08:00.294
I missed so much.

08:01.148 --> 08:03.815
-Hey. It's okay.
-(Jee-Yun crying)

08:04.042 --> 08:05.709
That's why I tried
to document everything.

08:05.727 --> 08:07.444
So you can catch up.

08:08.547 --> 08:09.562
Thanks.

08:09.639 --> 08:11.047
It's really sweet of you.

08:11.140 --> 08:14.308
-(crying)
-Let's go, messy baby.

08:14.328 --> 08:15.977
Okay. Yeah.

08:15.996 --> 08:18.238
<i> MADDIE:</i>
<i> It was so sweet,</i>

08:18.332 --> 08:20.698
but I was just
looking at the pictures

08:20.834 --> 08:22.909
thinking I should've been there.

08:23.061 --> 08:25.395
Look, even if you were here

08:25.413 --> 08:27.154
living your normal life,

08:27.249 --> 08:28.673
chances are
you probably would've missed

08:28.842 --> 08:30.008
some of those moments anyway.
Right?

08:30.159 --> 08:32.085
I mean, you-you can't be
with her 24/7.

08:32.179 --> 08:34.904
A few moments, sure.
But every early milestone?

08:34.998 --> 08:37.164

Hey, you're not a bad mother.

You were in a bad place,
but you're better now.

08:42.264 --> 08:43.747
You know,
and Jee won't even remember

08:43.840 --> 08:46.399

08:47.677 --> 08:49.419
You knew something was wrong
with our family,

08:53.867 --> 08:55.700
It haunted you your whole life.

08:55.927 --> 08:56.926
I don't want that for her.

08:56.945 --> 08:59.204
That was different. Okay?

08:59.431 --> 09:01.598
Mom and Dad never dealt
with their feelings,

09:01.733 --> 09:03.783

that I had been carrying around
most of my life.

10:12.261 --> 10:14.595
But he was the one
that showed me

10:14.615 --> 10:17.616

-(gasping)

18:03.324 --> 18:04.415
Wait, from his heart?

18:04.733 --> 18:06.976
What if you're wrong about
the dextrocardia?

18:07.069 --> 18:08.160
I'll collapse his lung,

18:08.254 --> 18:10.313
but I thought
I'd try not to do that.

18:10.406 --> 18:12.173
-Huh.
-HEN: Buck, start ventilating.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.384
I'm gonna drain the blood.

18:18.914 --> 18:19.746
-(gasps)
-HEN: All right.

18:19.915 --> 18:21.516
Here we go.

18:32.003 --> 18:34.403
♪ ♪

18:47.127 --> 18:49.368
I can hear his heartbeat
clearer now.

18:49.445 --> 18:52.037
He's returning
to normal sinus rhythm.

18:52.190 --> 18:53.689
BOBBY:
Okay. Let's move him.

18:53.708 --> 18:56.542
-I'll call it in
on the way to the hospital.
-(applause)

18:56.636 --> 18:58.027
(crowd chattering)

18:58.045 --> 18:59.637
(indistinct chatter over radio)

18:59.788 --> 19:01.973
Oh, he's okay. Great.

19:02.124 --> 19:03.808
I'm just gonna need you guys
to sign these releases

19:04.035 --> 19:05.368
on your way out,
so we can air the footage.

19:05.386 --> 19:07.794
-Yeah, yeah, great.
-No.
-No.

19:07.889 --> 19:09.564
No.

19:16.805 --> 19:18.322
(applause on TV)

19:18.474 --> 19:21.066
Carissa and Ephraim are
never gonna last.

19:21.161 --> 19:24.328
But that compatibility score
is off the charts.

19:24.480 --> 19:26.831
-Numbers aren't everything,
Henrietta.
-Oh.

19:26.982 --> 19:28.741
Says the scientist.

19:28.893 --> 19:31.669
-Uh, this is not science.
-(laughs)

19:31.820 --> 19:34.897
-It's more like a car crash
in slow motion.
-(people groaning on TV)

19:34.916 --> 19:36.156
Hey. Let's watch the finale.

19:36.176 --> 19:38.342
-We can see who's right.
-Mm-mm.

19:38.494 --> 19:40.327
Tomorrow, babe.

19:40.346 --> 19:42.930
Ah, I'm too tired tonight.

19:44.166 --> 19:46.258
Actually, I was thinking
that maybe tomorrow

19:46.352 --> 19:48.077
we could go downtown again.

19:48.095 --> 19:50.003
There's this digital art walk
happening.

19:50.097 --> 19:53.082
Oh, please tell me
this is not something else

19:53.100 --> 19:55.050
your coworkers were
talking about.

19:55.102 --> 19:56.435
Well, I read about it
in the<i> Times</i>

19:56.529 --> 20:00.865
and they said it was a...
modern urban adventure.

20:01.016 --> 20:02.533
It sounded fun.

20:02.685 --> 20:04.944
Okay.

20:05.096 --> 20:07.521
What's going on, Karen?

20:07.540 --> 20:10.875
First, you want to go
on this culinary expedition.

20:11.102 --> 20:14.770
-(laughs)
-Now it's an artistic adventure.

20:14.863 --> 20:19.050
What's next? A shopping safari?

20:21.963 --> 20:24.055
Did you know we have
11 subscriptions

20:24.206 --> 20:26.131
to streaming services?

20:26.226 --> 20:27.783
Since we had to cancel
my credit cards,

20:27.802 --> 20:28.875
I've been getting emails

20:28.895 --> 20:30.877
to update
our payment information.

20:30.897 --> 20:32.972
-11 emails.
-All-all right.

20:33.124 --> 20:35.958
Well, clearly,
we need to cut back.

20:35.977 --> 20:39.278
Or maybe we need to cut loose.

20:42.909 --> 20:46.318
-I feel old.
-W-What?

20:46.471 --> 20:47.803
At work.

20:47.896 --> 20:49.321
Everyone in my group,

20:49.474 --> 20:51.807
most of them are a decade
younger than me.

20:51.900 --> 20:53.993
Some are double that.

20:54.145 --> 20:55.736
-Well, Karen, you're their boss.
-Uh...

20:55.830 --> 20:58.647
Of course, you've been doing
this longer than them,

20:58.666 --> 21:02.001
so you're older.

21:02.153 --> 21:06.764
Their lives just seem
so different.

21:07.825 --> 21:09.249
They go out almost every night.

21:09.269 --> 21:11.994
Road trips on the weekends
and backpacking

21:11.996 --> 21:15.273
through exotic places
on their vacations.

21:16.501 --> 21:17.850
They work hard.

21:17.944 --> 21:20.444
And they play hard.

21:21.948 --> 21:24.031
They're making the most
of their lives.

21:24.767 --> 21:26.692
And you're not.

21:26.844 --> 21:28.344
KAREN:
Don't get me wrong.

21:28.362 --> 21:30.679
I love tea parties
with our foster kids

21:30.698 --> 21:35.184
and watching terrible TV shows
with you, but...

21:35.202 --> 21:39.964
But you miss being that age.

21:40.191 --> 21:43.208
-Not sure I ever was that age.
-(laughs softly)

21:43.361 --> 21:45.118
You know what I was like
when we met.

21:45.196 --> 21:48.806
Work hard, work harder.

21:49.033 --> 21:51.958
And now I can't help but wonder,

21:52.036 --> 21:54.145
what did I miss out on?

22:00.044 --> 22:02.010
<i> HEN:</i>
<i> I mean, I-I get it.</i>

22:02.063 --> 22:05.472
She spent her 20s going
after a very specific goal.

22:05.491 --> 22:07.641
You know, she didn't waste time
trying to figure out

22:07.660 --> 22:09.234
what she wanted like I did.

22:09.329 --> 22:11.554
Now she's feeling like
she missed out

22:11.572 --> 22:12.997
on a key part of life.

22:13.224 --> 22:14.390
BOBBY:
I thought Karen liked her job.

22:14.408 --> 22:17.409
Yeah-- She does.
It's-it's not really that.

22:17.503 --> 22:19.837
It's like...

22:20.064 --> 22:22.398
She never got to be really free.

22:22.533 --> 22:26.552
So she wants to be 20 again.
Work all day, party all night.

22:26.737 --> 22:28.904
Wouldn't go back
to my 20s if you paid me.

22:28.923 --> 22:30.573
-Same.
-CHIMNEY: I don't know,

22:30.707 --> 22:32.516
if you could do it all over
again, you wouldn't think about

22:32.743 --> 22:35.260
-doing something different
with your life?
-BOBBY: No chance.

22:35.413 --> 22:37.596
In my family, there was
only one career option

22:37.748 --> 22:39.005
for boys: firefighter.

22:39.025 --> 22:41.100
I didn't know you were
a legacy, Cap.

22:41.268 --> 22:43.752
-Fourth generation.
-BUCK: I got it.

22:43.754 --> 22:44.937
Crypto.

22:45.106 --> 22:46.772
LUCY:
Uh, come again?

22:46.924 --> 22:48.014
Cryptocurrency.

22:48.183 --> 22:50.016
If you would've bought
back in 2012,

22:50.036 --> 22:52.018
you'd be set for life by now.

22:52.187 --> 22:53.687
I can't believe
I missed out on that.

22:53.706 --> 22:55.781
That's your big regret in life?

22:55.933 --> 22:57.023
BUCK:
Oh, I mean,

22:57.118 --> 22:58.042
basically did everything else

22:58.193 --> 22:59.435
before I became a firefighter.

22:59.528 --> 23:01.379
So, yeah, no,
I feel pretty good about my 20s.

23:01.530 --> 23:04.364
-(laughs)
-Hen, you think Karen
is just, I don't know,

23:04.384 --> 23:06.050
maybe just going through
a midlife crisis?

23:06.277 --> 23:09.870
When did I become middle-aged?

23:09.889 --> 23:11.797
Uh, w-well, you know,

23:11.891 --> 23:14.617
the life expectancy for women
is-is, what, like, 80? So...

23:14.635 --> 23:16.619
LUCY:
You know, if you keep
talking like that,

23:16.637 --> 23:18.804
I think this is about to be
your biggest regret in life.

23:18.956 --> 23:20.547
Or what's left of it.

23:20.566 --> 23:23.809
-(clears throat)
-BOBBY: Hen, you and Karen
love each other.

23:23.903 --> 23:25.051
You have a good life together.

23:25.146 --> 23:26.295
Is it possible
you're overthinking this?

23:26.313 --> 23:27.905
HEN:
I mean, she seemed worried

23:28.056 --> 23:31.742
that she'd missed out
on something important.

23:31.894 --> 23:33.577
I'm not sure how to fix that.

23:33.729 --> 23:35.913
CHIMNEY:
You can't.

23:36.064 --> 23:37.731
No matter how much
we wish we could,

23:37.825 --> 23:41.335
there's no such thing
as making up for lost time.

23:47.001 --> 23:50.819
Hey, Mom.
I see a common warbler.

23:50.913 --> 23:52.913
That's not a common warbler,
dummy.

23:52.932 --> 23:54.006
That's an orange-crowned.

23:54.100 --> 23:55.824
Don't call
your sister names, Dani.

23:55.918 --> 23:58.936
-MIMI: Wow, look at that. Whoa.
-DANI: Come on, let's go.

23:59.163 --> 24:02.440
You're awful quiet today.
What's going on?

24:02.591 --> 24:06.152
Come on.
You used tell me everything.

24:07.505 --> 24:08.612
Not anymore.

24:08.764 --> 24:10.522
We only see you on weekends now.

24:10.616 --> 24:12.691
I know I'm not there
as much as I used to be,

24:12.843 --> 24:15.101
but I am still your mom 24/7.

24:15.121 --> 24:18.697
Whatever's going on,
you can talk to me.

24:18.866 --> 24:21.016
I don't want to live
with Dad anymore.

24:21.035 --> 24:22.868
Okay? I want to live with you.

24:22.962 --> 24:25.337
Oh, honey. You know
why we did it this way.

24:25.447 --> 24:27.113
It's easier for you
to stay with your Dad

24:27.133 --> 24:28.966
during the week
while I'm working.

24:29.193 --> 24:32.878
And then we get to do fun things
together on the weekend.

24:33.030 --> 24:34.788
But you're never there
when I need you.

24:34.807 --> 24:37.883
I'm just a phone call away.
Any time, day or night.

24:38.035 --> 24:39.810
Even after midnight?

24:40.037 --> 24:42.480
Especially then.

24:42.631 --> 24:44.707
MIMI:
Hey, look at that.
Race you up there.

24:44.725 --> 24:46.299
DANI:
Wait for me.

24:47.394 --> 24:50.154
-Mom, look at this.
-What do you think it is?

24:50.305 --> 24:53.449
-Why is it here?
-I don't know.

24:54.994 --> 24:57.119
MIMI:
Cool.

25:00.574 --> 25:01.890
Hey, Dani.

25:01.909 --> 25:03.501
-Tag, you're it.
-Hey!

25:03.652 --> 25:05.252
(laughs)

25:07.006 --> 25:09.173
-Got you!
-(laughs)

25:10.158 --> 25:12.417
-You're it.
-Hey.

25:12.586 --> 25:13.677
Be careful, girls.

25:14.405 --> 25:17.473
-ELENA: I'm gonna get you.
Gonna get you.
-(laughter)

25:18.851 --> 25:20.726
I'm gonna get you.

25:21.762 --> 25:23.503
-Mom.
-Elena, move!

25:23.914 --> 25:25.731
(screaming)

25:32.089 --> 25:34.365
(siren wailing, horns honking)

25:40.039 --> 25:42.206
(indistinct radio chatter)

25:42.399 --> 25:43.707
BOBBY:
This whole area
was a missile base

25:43.934 --> 25:45.025
right up through the Cold War.

25:45.044 --> 25:46.785
My guess? It's been 50 years

25:46.937 --> 25:47.711
since they capped these silos

25:47.938 --> 25:49.955
and they're not holding anymore.

25:50.107 --> 25:52.791
All right, Buck, you got this.

25:52.943 --> 25:55.611
Hi, I'm Bobby.
What happened here?

25:55.629 --> 25:56.870
We were just playing and,

25:56.947 --> 25:58.055
and, I don't know,
the ground moved

25:58.206 --> 25:59.281
and she just disappeared.

25:59.374 --> 26:01.967
We called for her,
but she's not answering.

26:02.061 --> 26:03.727
-I want to see Mom.
-BOBBY: We are gonna do

26:03.879 --> 26:05.062
everything we can for her.

26:05.213 --> 26:06.138
I tell you what,
let's go wait by the engine

26:06.290 --> 26:07.806
while they get her out. Come on.

26:07.958 --> 26:09.291
CHIMNEY:
Might be as much as 80 feet.

26:09.310 --> 26:11.384
LUCY:
There's some kind
of gate over there.

26:11.404 --> 26:13.478
Maybe it's a tunnel.
We could get to her that way.

26:13.573 --> 26:16.298
Rappelling down is gonna be
the quickest way to get to her.

26:16.391 --> 26:18.909
But it might be safer
to bring her out that way.

26:19.061 --> 26:21.370
Okay, you grab saws,
I'll grab harnesses.

26:22.081 --> 26:22.988
BOBBY:
Yep, go ahead,

26:23.082 --> 26:25.332
take a seat right there.

26:28.646 --> 26:29.753
What are they doing?

26:29.905 --> 26:31.404
Well, it's kind of
like rock climbing.

26:31.465 --> 26:34.240
We put the harnesses on,
we attach them to cables

26:34.335 --> 26:35.968
so we can lower ourselves
to get to your mom.

26:36.929 --> 26:39.412
DANI:
And then you pull her out?

26:39.432 --> 26:40.580
Won't that hurt her?

26:40.674 --> 26:42.433
We're gonna get her out
in a different way.

26:46.439 --> 26:48.480
We're in.

26:50.793 --> 26:51.975
Hen, we're on our way to you.

26:52.128 --> 26:54.445
HEN:
Visibility is zero.

26:54.596 --> 26:55.613
Okay, wait, wait.

26:55.764 --> 26:58.073
I have a visual. I can see her.

26:58.843 --> 27:00.600
Okay, I'm on the ground.

27:00.694 --> 27:02.161
Touchdown.

27:07.017 --> 27:09.418
The kids... Where?

27:11.130 --> 27:12.371
HEN:
They're fine, they're fine.

27:12.465 --> 27:14.214
Let's just focus
on you right now.

27:15.876 --> 27:18.135
-Cap, we got her.
<i> -BOBBY: Copy that.</i>

27:20.306 --> 27:22.789
CHIMNEY:
Heart rate's way up,
blood pressure's really low.

27:22.867 --> 27:24.391
Running fluids.

27:25.811 --> 27:27.870
ANNABELLE:
Can't really

27:27.963 --> 27:29.554
feel much.

27:29.631 --> 27:31.231
Could be the adrenaline.

27:33.394 --> 27:35.135
Likely a pelvic fracture.

27:35.154 --> 27:39.406
Abdomen is warm to the touch,
belly's full of blood.

27:40.475 --> 27:42.217
Need... my kids.

27:42.236 --> 27:44.720
They're waiting for you
up at the surface.

27:44.813 --> 27:46.330
(coughing)

27:50.411 --> 27:53.420
I'm not gonna make it
back to them, am I?

27:54.581 --> 27:56.081
Well, your organs

27:56.233 --> 27:58.734
may have sustained
some serious trauma.

27:58.752 --> 28:00.903
It's-it's hard for us to know

28:00.996 --> 28:03.906
just how severe it is
from down here.

28:03.999 --> 28:05.941
CHIMNEY:
Once we get you to the hospital,

28:05.943 --> 28:06.850
they can assess.

28:07.002 --> 28:09.912
So dumb, being out here.

28:09.930 --> 28:14.041
Trying to make up for lost time.

28:14.043 --> 28:16.585
I'm sure your girls understand.

28:16.603 --> 28:19.154
Can I talk to them?

28:22.276 --> 28:24.535
If we delay getting
you to the hospital...

28:24.704 --> 28:27.538
Please. I need to tell them.

28:32.937 --> 28:34.753
Okay.

28:38.200 --> 28:40.551

someone to look out for her.

35:06.254 --> 35:09.164
There's nothing wrong with
wanting to protect your family.

35:09.166 --> 35:11.349
But before all that,
I wanted to be someone,

35:11.501 --> 35:14.686

in a place you knew,

and keep your family safe.

35:30.871 --> 35:32.612
I understand the motivation.

35:32.706 --> 35:34.780
Does that make me a coward?

35:34.800 --> 35:38.117
I don't think cowards
usually ask that question.

35:39.212 --> 35:42.139

MADDIE:
You're a smart cookie.

40:26.073 --> 40:28.983
-Yes.
-Oh, God, this is a huge moment.

40:29.076 --> 40:30.075
-I should document it.
-No, no, no.

40:30.153 --> 40:31.986
Let's just enjoy
the moment together.

40:31.988 --> 40:34.489
Aww. Do it again.

40:34.582 --> 40:36.916

You can do it.

40:37.010 --> 40:38.768
