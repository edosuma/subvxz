I get to go back to my desk.

to be contrite about?

The CIA has asked me
that question before.

03:18.322 --> 03:22.026
Both then and now,
it feels like an indictment.

03:22.028 --> 03:24.829
The truth is the CIA needs me
to blur those lines,

03:24.831 --> 03:29.302
and I am very good at it.

03:32.205 --> 03:34.407

the question.

anything.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.101
I don't know what you mean.

12:50.103 --> 12:52.437
I thought
he was just being creepy.

12:52.439 --> 12:53.772
But...
[Sighs]

12:53.774 --> 12:55.273
now I am afraid.

12:55.275 --> 12:58.543
What if he knows
I was working with Mossad?

12:58.545 --> 13:00.246
Who was he traveling with?

13:00.248 --> 13:04.617
I don't know.
I can't...

13:04.619 --> 13:05.952
I want to be done.

13:05.954 --> 13:09.089
I want out.
No.

13:09.091 --> 13:10.590
We need you in the field.

13:10.592 --> 13:12.592
This is not
what I signed up for.

13:12.594 --> 13:14.461
I was supposed to wear
a fancy watch

13:14.463 --> 13:17.297
and then just go about my job--
that's all.

13:17.299 --> 13:20.468
You knew the risks involved
when you accepted our money.

13:20.470 --> 13:22.002
I don't care
about the money anymore!

13:22.004 --> 13:24.638
Please.

13:24.640 --> 13:27.641
I know there is something
called an exit package.

13:27.643 --> 13:29.976
Never heard of it.

13:29.978 --> 13:31.845
You can't decide
when you want to leave?

13:31.847 --> 13:35.649
You can decide.

13:35.651 --> 13:38.452
It would just be easier
for us to help you...

13:38.454 --> 13:40.154
if you gave us the watch.

13:40.156 --> 13:43.324
[Scoffs]
The watch is my only leverage.

13:43.326 --> 13:44.959
We'll give you
half a million.

13:44.961 --> 13:47.662
You're not listening.
I just want--

13:47.664 --> 13:49.464
- [gasps]
- Are you all right?

13:49.466 --> 13:50.665
Karina?
[Wheezing]

13:50.667 --> 13:52.433
Karina?

13:56.204 --> 13:57.871
Is she dead?

14:06.925 --> 14:08.578
We were able to remove the body

14:08.678 --> 14:10.577
without the FBI catching wind.

14:10.579 --> 14:12.413
Tech Ops is currently
drilling down

14:12.415 --> 14:14.381
on Karina's flight manifest
for leads.

14:14.383 --> 14:15.749
Well, that's now
beside the point.

14:15.751 --> 14:18.218
- You promised to help us.
- And we did.

14:18.220 --> 14:19.553
Our asset dies on your soil,

14:19.555 --> 14:21.688
and we still don't have
our intel.

14:21.690 --> 14:24.391
The medical examiner said
she was poisoned 24 hours ago.

14:24.393 --> 14:26.260
That's before
we were involved.

14:26.262 --> 14:28.028
Really?
Well, forgive us for feeling

14:28.030 --> 14:29.997
that you have not upheld
your side of the bargain.

14:29.999 --> 14:31.865
Is there anything
that Mossad could share with us

14:31.867 --> 14:33.767
about the intel
on that watch?

14:33.769 --> 14:35.535
Maybe if we had
some specific leads--

14:35.537 --> 14:38.738
Ms. Walker, those questions
are inappropriate,

14:38.740 --> 14:41.040
and they are not helpful.

14:41.042 --> 14:42.909
As far as I can tell,

14:42.911 --> 14:44.744
your fieldwork at best
is unpredictable.

14:44.746 --> 14:47.046
At worst, it is reckless.
Hey!

14:47.048 --> 14:48.414
Don't talk to her that way.

14:48.416 --> 14:50.616
Excuse me?

14:50.618 --> 14:53.419
She's just trying to make
the best of a bad situation.

14:53.421 --> 14:55.087
If you want to yell
at somebody, yell at me.

14:55.089 --> 14:56.756
Oh, that can be arranged.

14:56.758 --> 14:59.925
All I meant was that
just because we lost the asset

14:59.927 --> 15:01.594
doesn't mean
we've lost the intel.

15:01.596 --> 15:03.429
We can still continue
the mission.

15:03.431 --> 15:05.465
Prove it.

15:05.467 --> 15:07.467
I will call you as soon
as we speak to Tech Ops.

15:16.911 --> 15:18.112
[Knock at door]

15:19.447 --> 15:20.781
You wanted to see me?

15:20.783 --> 15:23.250
Annie, come on in.

15:26.154 --> 15:28.288
Well, you've done
a great service for this Agency.

15:28.290 --> 15:29.456
Thank you.

15:29.458 --> 15:30.958
Now, we're gonna be
presenting you

15:30.960 --> 15:32.460
with the Intelligence
Medal of Merit.

15:32.462 --> 15:34.796
Are you familiar
with that award?

15:34.798 --> 15:36.631
That's the award
with the cash payment.

15:36.633 --> 15:39.167
Yes.

15:39.169 --> 15:41.469
What am I supposed
to take away from all this?

15:43.172 --> 15:45.774
That you've done something
important for this agency

15:45.776 --> 15:48.978
and for this nation
at great personal risk.

15:48.980 --> 15:51.747
Please sit down.

15:55.618 --> 15:58.454
You closed a circle.

15:58.456 --> 16:02.191
And Simon Fischer died.

16:02.193 --> 16:04.460
I mean...
[Clears throat]

16:04.462 --> 16:06.996
we didn't get to debrief him.

16:06.998 --> 16:09.799
I know it's hard.

16:09.801 --> 16:13.669
But these awards
are part of our culture.

16:13.671 --> 16:15.671
And we need to recognize
our heroes,

16:15.673 --> 16:17.006
if only to each other.

16:17.008 --> 16:19.042
It's our way of saying
thank you.

16:19.044 --> 16:20.977
We're proud of you.

16:20.979 --> 16:24.447
And I'm not the only one
who's relieved that you're home.

16:26.350 --> 16:29.185
Joan is shy
about expressing emotions.

16:29.187 --> 16:33.789
But she was deeply distraught
while you were in Russia.

16:33.791 --> 16:37.025
And it means a great deal
to her that you're home...

16:37.027 --> 16:39.528
and safe.

16:41.164 --> 16:43.999
I appreciate hearing that.

16:44.001 --> 16:46.034
- Annie's come home.
- I heard.

16:46.036 --> 16:47.869
[Clears throat]
Congratulations.

16:47.871 --> 16:49.337
Seth, I see her falling

16:49.339 --> 16:51.672
into all the same patterns
I did.

16:51.674 --> 16:53.341
Listen, maybe you can talk
to her about this.

16:53.343 --> 16:54.742
How can I do that

16:54.744 --> 16:57.678
without compromising
my position?

16:57.680 --> 16:59.713
Your position as what--
as her manager?

16:59.715 --> 17:01.381
As a constant.

17:01.383 --> 17:03.250
I would like to be
the one thing in her life

17:03.252 --> 17:06.086
that's not changing.

17:06.088 --> 17:09.823
You are going
to reach Annie, okay?

17:09.825 --> 17:12.759
She's not gonna be
in the shadows alone.

17:12.761 --> 17:15.929
I hope not.

17:15.931 --> 17:18.897
[Telephone ringing]

17:18.900 --> 17:22.368
- You got news for me?
- Who do you see on my screen?

17:25.272 --> 17:27.775
He looks like the guy from
the plane Karina was describing.

17:27.777 --> 17:29.343
It says "Agency trained."

17:29.345 --> 17:30.577
Is he a private
security officer?

17:30.579 --> 17:33.714
Yes.
Griffin Cole is his name.

17:33.716 --> 17:35.249
He's ex-CIA.

17:35.251 --> 17:38.753
He's one of those guys who still
games the Agency for access

17:38.755 --> 17:40.554
while he makes a mint
in the private sector.

17:40.556 --> 17:43.091
- He's a green badge?
- More like a black badge.

17:43.093 --> 17:45.960
Okay, so what do we know?
Does he have a kill pattern?

17:45.962 --> 17:47.261
Ricin.

17:47.263 --> 17:49.697
She probably didn't even
feel the prick.

17:49.699 --> 17:52.633
But I'm still
burying the lead.

17:52.635 --> 17:55.136
Griffin Cole now works
for this guy.

17:55.138 --> 17:56.471
Is that who I think it is?

17:56.473 --> 17:58.573
Do you think
it's Khalid Ansari,

17:58.575 --> 18:00.741
son of one of the most powerful
oil men in Saudi Arabia?

18:00.743 --> 18:03.945
- I do.
- Then, yes.

18:03.947 --> 18:06.948
- I got to talk to Joan.
- Mm-hmm.

18:10.252 --> 18:14.655
Mossad is using us
to spy on Khalid Ansari.

18:14.657 --> 18:16.757
Now do you understand
why we can't trust them?

18:16.759 --> 18:18.792
- Is Khalid an asset?
- Worse.

18:18.794 --> 18:21.095
He's a friend
of the State Department.

18:21.097 --> 18:23.096
His dad plays golf
with the vice president.

18:23.098 --> 18:24.264
He's untouchable.

18:24.266 --> 18:26.300
Even more reason
for a counter play.

18:26.302 --> 18:27.767
No, I am calling this off.

18:27.769 --> 18:30.003
The only reason I agreed to this
is because we owed Mossad.

18:30.005 --> 18:31.304
Right, you agreed.

18:31.306 --> 18:33.474
And now they're here
on our soil

18:33.476 --> 18:34.642
spying on our ally.

18:34.644 --> 18:36.310
Don't you want to know why?

18:36.312 --> 18:37.945
Do you think Eyal
will tell you?

18:37.947 --> 18:40.114
I think there's more
to discover than just the watch.

18:40.116 --> 18:41.983
[Sighs]

18:41.985 --> 18:43.985
I think I can find out
what Eyal's after

18:43.987 --> 18:45.654
and get to the intel first.

18:45.656 --> 18:47.356
What if he gets
to it first?

18:47.358 --> 18:48.691
You said you put me on this

18:48.693 --> 18:50.426
because I'm good
at handling Eyal.

18:50.428 --> 18:51.827
Let me handle him.

18:51.829 --> 18:53.328
That's fine.

18:53.330 --> 18:55.631
My concern is that
he's handling you.

18:55.633 --> 18:57.666
He isn't.

18:57.668 --> 18:59.301
He won't.

18:59.303 --> 19:01.837
Okay.

19:09.678 --> 19:11.779
Since this whole thing
is hush-hush,

19:11.781 --> 19:14.115
I can't use my guy
at Metro police

19:14.117 --> 19:15.583
to get traffic photos.

19:15.585 --> 19:19.954
So we may have very carefully
hacked into their system.

19:19.956 --> 19:22.022
Don't worry.
They'll never know.

19:22.024 --> 19:23.625
[Chuckles]

19:23.627 --> 19:26.895
I have no doubt.

19:26.897 --> 19:30.064
So this is the last place
she visited yesterday morning.

19:30.066 --> 19:33.000
You don't happen to see a sign
reading "watch buried here,"

19:33.002 --> 19:34.335
do you?

19:34.337 --> 19:36.703
[Chuckles]
That'd be nice.

19:36.705 --> 19:39.206
You know
that if metaphorical sunshine

19:39.208 --> 19:40.307
were allowed on this one,

19:40.309 --> 19:42.008
I'd have an entire team
out there.

19:42.010 --> 19:44.677
We could dig up that whole area,
call it a parks project.

19:44.679 --> 19:47.213
But the State Department
would start buzzing.

19:47.215 --> 19:48.380
I know.

19:48.382 --> 19:49.715
Any chance this thing
you gave me

19:49.717 --> 19:51.684
is some sort
of magical metal detector?

19:51.686 --> 19:53.386
No. Sorry.

19:53.388 --> 19:55.555
It's just a regular one.

19:55.557 --> 19:58.057
- Auggie, I got to go.
- Yeah.

19:59.727 --> 20:03.329
How did you find me?
I checked my tail.

20:03.331 --> 20:05.898
I had a GPS tracking device
in my pocket.

20:05.900 --> 20:07.901
It must've fallen out
when I riding in your car.

20:07.903 --> 20:09.669
Uhhuh.

20:09.671 --> 20:11.938
I would've called you
if I'd found anything.

20:11.940 --> 20:13.940
Oh, absolutely--
as would I.

20:13.942 --> 20:15.174
Does Mossad have any idea

20:15.176 --> 20:16.876
what kind of intel is
on this watch?

20:16.878 --> 20:19.545
The mission is
to retrieve the watch.

20:19.547 --> 20:21.047
That is all.

20:21.049 --> 20:23.582
- Who's the target?
- You tell me.

20:23.584 --> 20:25.751
Khalid Ansari.

20:25.753 --> 20:29.188
Why is Mossad
investigating him?

20:29.190 --> 20:31.190
Your nation
is its own worst enemy

20:31.192 --> 20:33.059
when it comes
to Saudi Arabia.

20:33.061 --> 20:35.629
You can't allow yourself
to see anything bad

20:35.631 --> 20:37.230
when oil is involved.

20:37.232 --> 20:39.800
That may be true
of my nation.

20:39.802 --> 20:43.371
But this is me asking.

20:43.373 --> 20:45.640
We believe he's using
a series of charities

20:45.642 --> 20:47.242
as terror fronts.

20:47.244 --> 20:48.577
What's on the watch--

20:48.579 --> 20:51.446
his travel details,
his bank accounts, Rolodex?

20:51.448 --> 20:52.781
All of the above?

20:52.783 --> 20:53.949
Like I said before,

20:53.951 --> 20:55.618
the mission is to retrieve
the watch...

20:55.620 --> 20:57.153
not to spin theories.

20:57.155 --> 20:58.654
[Sighs]
Okay.

20:58.656 --> 21:01.557
Let's retrieve it.

21:09.131 --> 21:12.467
What does that open?

21:12.469 --> 21:14.469
It doesn't open anything.

21:18.974 --> 21:20.642
You know, at Mossad,

21:20.644 --> 21:23.445
when you return home
after surviving capture,

21:23.447 --> 21:27.449
they throw you a feast
in the desert.

21:27.451 --> 21:29.484
What does CIA do?

21:31.487 --> 21:34.989
Pay you off.

21:37.326 --> 21:40.028
[Shovel thuds]

21:46.268 --> 21:47.969
There's something here.

21:49.872 --> 21:52.040
Ha ha.

22:06.512 --> 22:08.266
Tech int believe
Karina rented a box

22:08.267 --> 22:09.501
at a private bank
in Alexandria.

22:09.503 --> 22:11.136
So we open the box.

22:11.138 --> 22:12.805
We can't break into a bank

22:12.807 --> 22:15.341
to access a personal
safety deposit box.

22:15.343 --> 22:19.478
American laws--
they're so baffling.

22:19.480 --> 22:21.013
Let me rephrase.

22:21.015 --> 22:23.449
We can't use
full agency resources

22:23.451 --> 22:25.117
to break into a bank
without involving

22:25.119 --> 22:26.785
the FBI or Homeland Security.

22:26.787 --> 22:28.120
And if we do that,

22:28.122 --> 22:31.924
our ability
to operate discreetly vanishes.

22:31.926 --> 22:33.192
I can go in.

22:33.194 --> 22:35.161
How do you propose
to do that?

22:35.163 --> 22:37.464
We're roughly the same age,
and I have her key.

22:37.466 --> 22:39.633
If I learn her personal details
and her signature,

22:39.635 --> 22:41.534
who's to say
it's not my account?

22:41.536 --> 22:43.202
We cannot support
that approach.

22:43.204 --> 22:47.172
CIA would have privileged access
to whatever's inside.

22:47.174 --> 22:49.474
Are you suggested
we'd keep something from you?

22:49.476 --> 22:51.843
No, Joan.

22:51.845 --> 22:54.312
This is a partnership,
but, uh...

22:54.314 --> 22:57.015
we would be most grateful
for some reassurance.

22:57.017 --> 22:58.783
We can wire her.

22:58.785 --> 23:00.185
You'll be able
to maintain contact.

23:00.187 --> 23:02.621
But not in the vault.

23:02.623 --> 23:05.157
Those things are like cages.
It's no place for a spy.

23:05.159 --> 23:06.491
I know what I'm doing.

23:06.493 --> 23:08.360
Annie, think
about what you're saying.

23:08.362 --> 23:09.662
You want to pretend
to be someone

23:09.664 --> 23:11.263
who was just killed
for this intel.

23:11.265 --> 23:12.331
I don't think
she was killed <i>for</i> the intel.

23:12.333 --> 23:13.800
He poisoned her
because he believed

23:13.802 --> 23:15.401
she was a spy for Mossad.

23:15.403 --> 23:17.871
Taking the purse
is just good trade craft

23:17.873 --> 23:19.872
so he can find out
what she's really after and why.

23:19.874 --> 23:21.541
Where are you going
with this?

23:21.543 --> 23:23.576
To rent a safety deposit box,
you have to pay for it.

23:23.578 --> 23:25.678
That means receipts
and credit cards.

23:25.680 --> 23:27.313
All that could've been
in the purse.

23:27.315 --> 23:28.715
How long do you think
it'll take

23:28.717 --> 23:30.383
for him to get
to the bank himself?

23:30.385 --> 23:31.851
We can't keep standing around
discussing this.

23:31.853 --> 23:33.719
We have to act.
Yeah, but not recklessly.

23:33.721 --> 23:35.053
You said it yourself.

23:35.055 --> 23:36.454
He may be monitoring
the bank,

23:36.456 --> 23:38.890
waiting for some young woman
to show up with a key.

23:38.892 --> 23:39.958
He's right, Annie.

23:39.960 --> 23:41.526
The risks
are not insignificant.

23:41.528 --> 23:44.729
This is our best shot
at finding the intel.

23:44.731 --> 23:46.898
Isn't that right?

23:46.900 --> 23:48.367
Mossad will provide the wire.

23:48.369 --> 23:51.437
That way, each partner
can do his part.

23:54.007 --> 23:56.409
Good.

24:04.385 --> 24:06.286
I got the answer from him.

24:06.288 --> 24:08.255
Mossad believes Khalid is
moving money through charities

24:08.257 --> 24:09.756
to terror organizations.

24:09.758 --> 24:11.258
Hmm.

24:11.260 --> 24:13.594
The watch contains
his schedule, Rolodex,

24:13.596 --> 24:15.962
and bank details.

24:15.964 --> 24:17.964
I figured he'd tell you
something like that--

24:17.966 --> 24:20.267
tease you with
the most potent piece of intel.

24:20.269 --> 24:22.569
I believe him.

24:22.571 --> 24:26.107
Okay. Well, we'll find out
soon enough--

24:26.109 --> 24:27.775
as soon as you bring
that intel back.

24:27.777 --> 24:29.310
In the meantime,

24:29.312 --> 24:32.280
Karina's signature and details
are on file for you to memorize.

24:32.282 --> 24:34.315
- I'll be right in.
- Okay.

25:44.988 --> 25:48.623
Wow, first day back's
turned into night?

25:48.625 --> 25:51.526
I have to learn this
by tomorrow.

25:51.528 --> 25:53.695
So...

25:53.697 --> 25:55.863
I guess beer's
out of the question.

25:55.865 --> 25:57.832
Unfortunately.

26:00.502 --> 26:02.537
It's been a strange day.

26:02.539 --> 26:05.306
This morning I was being
debriefed at a horse farm,

26:05.308 --> 26:06.875
unsure if I still had a job.

26:06.877 --> 26:09.211
I've been ushered back

26:09.213 --> 26:11.212
and told I'm getting
a medal tomorrow.

26:11.214 --> 26:13.414
- That's good.
- Is it?

26:13.416 --> 26:17.485
Let's discuss that
over beers...

26:17.487 --> 26:20.822
Just not tonight.

26:23.225 --> 26:24.993
Welcome home, Walker.

26:57.430 --> 27:00.898
[Door closes]

27:00.900 --> 27:03.768
- Hi.
- I've been looking for you.

27:03.770 --> 27:05.603
I had a meeting
at Persia House.

27:05.605 --> 27:08.306
Oh, your assistant said
you've been off campus.

27:08.308 --> 27:10.074
It's been a busy day.

27:10.076 --> 27:11.943
Was that Seth Newman?

27:11.945 --> 27:14.412
Uh...

27:14.414 --> 27:16.981
I didn't see.

27:16.983 --> 27:18.583
Oh.

27:18.585 --> 27:21.886
Well, I'll see you
at the house.

27:21.888 --> 27:24.656
Wait.
Did you want something?

27:24.658 --> 27:28.059
Oh, the engraver
for Annie's award

27:28.061 --> 27:29.561
had a style question.

27:29.563 --> 27:32.297
Beth helped me out.
Okay.

27:32.299 --> 27:34.133
I'll see you later.

27:34.135 --> 27:35.401
See you later.

28:11.171 --> 28:12.805
[Silenced gunshots]

28:16.777 --> 28:19.611
[Dog barking]

28:44.836 --> 28:46.536
- Good evening.
- Hi.

28:46.538 --> 28:49.572
Uh, I'd like a room, please.
Of course.

28:49.574 --> 28:51.708
How many nights?

28:51.710 --> 28:53.976
I'll be staying
for a while.

29:02.382 --> 29:03.981
- Good morning, Miss.
- Good morning.

29:03.983 --> 29:05.149
My name's Karina Vost.

29:05.151 --> 29:06.751
I'd like access
to my safe deposit box.

29:06.753 --> 29:08.686
Just a moment.

29:08.688 --> 29:10.388
[Keys clacking]

29:12.891 --> 29:14.392
Birth date and place, please.

29:14.394 --> 29:18.697
October 31, 1981,
Lugano, Switzerland.

29:18.699 --> 29:21.367
I was raised here, though.

29:21.369 --> 29:23.369
I see.
Account number?

29:23.371 --> 29:25.070
785-5...

29:25.072 --> 29:26.072
4-3-2...

29:26.074 --> 29:27.239
11-86.

29:27.241 --> 29:29.875
Thank you.

29:29.877 --> 29:33.211
And sign here, please.

29:44.290 --> 29:45.424
[Computer beeps]

29:45.426 --> 29:48.260
Oh, there seems to be
a problem.

29:48.262 --> 29:49.961
I don't understand.

29:49.963 --> 29:51.930
The signature doesn't match.

29:51.932 --> 29:54.399
- Oh, let me try again.
- Sure.

29:59.104 --> 30:02.073
Go ahead.

30:09.814 --> 30:12.748
Thank you, Ms. Vost.
Follow me.

30:21.258 --> 30:23.926
Box 4-2-5, please.

30:23.928 --> 30:25.895
Here's the key.

30:37.141 --> 30:38.241
I'll give you some privacy

30:38.243 --> 30:40.177
and be back in a minute
to check on you.

30:40.179 --> 30:41.411
Thank you.

31:10.174 --> 31:13.510
[Door closes]

31:13.512 --> 31:15.145
That doesn't belong to you.

31:25.489 --> 31:27.356
How did you get in here?

31:27.358 --> 31:29.358
Just give it to me--

31:29.360 --> 31:31.560
whatever you just took
out of that box.

31:31.562 --> 31:34.496
It's just money.
I left it all inside.

31:34.498 --> 31:36.832
You don't think I know how
to tap into a bank camera feed?

31:36.834 --> 31:39.167
There are holes
in your plan.

31:39.169 --> 31:40.702
You'll never get out of here.

31:40.704 --> 31:44.205
There's a man--
I'm guessing Mossad--

31:44.207 --> 31:45.373
waiting outside.

31:45.375 --> 31:46.875
He's not my only backup.

31:46.877 --> 31:49.311
I trained at the farm too.

31:49.313 --> 31:52.014
If CIA wanted a big party,
there'd be one.

31:52.016 --> 31:55.316
Now hand it over.

32:11.567 --> 32:12.900
No.

32:12.902 --> 32:14.202
Hey!

32:14.204 --> 32:15.603
Help!

32:15.605 --> 32:17.071
Help!

32:29.752 --> 32:32.087
[Gunshot]

32:37.226 --> 32:38.794
[Gunshot]

32:38.796 --> 32:40.863
Help!

32:42.565 --> 32:44.567
- What's going on?
- Open the door.

32:44.569 --> 32:46.435
Hurry!

33:10.492 --> 33:12.793
What are you doing
for Khalid?

33:33.448 --> 33:36.350
He's gone, Eyal.

33:39.020 --> 33:41.288
[Speaking Hebrew]
How did he even get in there?

33:41.290 --> 33:42.823
He must've found a hole
in the security

33:42.825 --> 33:44.959
or paid someone off or--
Those are just theories.

33:44.961 --> 33:46.661
Yeah, they're just theories.
But it doesn't matter now.

33:46.663 --> 33:48.496
He didn't succeed.
Well, he's got the watch.

33:48.498 --> 33:49.998
Will you just
wait a second?

33:50.000 --> 33:52.200
No. It could take years before
we get intel on Khalid again.

33:52.202 --> 33:54.202
Eyal!

33:56.806 --> 33:58.307
I've tried firewalls

33:58.309 --> 34:00.142
and keeping layers of secrets
from people close to me,

34:00.144 --> 34:02.178
and it didn't work out
so well.

34:02.180 --> 34:04.848
What does that mean?

34:04.850 --> 34:07.317
I mean this belongs
to both of us.

34:17.304 --> 34:19.304
Ann Catherine Walker...

34:19.764 --> 34:23.301
please accept this award
on behalf of a grateful agency.

34:23.303 --> 34:25.670
Thank you.

34:35.779 --> 34:38.848
Sir...

34:38.850 --> 34:41.317
I know I'm not allowed
to keep this.

34:41.319 --> 34:45.588
I'll make sure it's safe.
Congrats again.

34:49.025 --> 34:51.828
Annie.

34:51.830 --> 34:53.330
I, um...

34:53.331 --> 34:55.666
I thought you might like to know
we're tracking Griffin Cole,

34:55.668 --> 34:57.768
and I'm confident
we'll find him.

34:57.770 --> 34:59.236
Good.

34:59.238 --> 35:01.272
And the analysts are already
combing through the intel

35:01.274 --> 35:03.174
on that watch.

35:03.176 --> 35:05.443
Okay.

35:07.045 --> 35:09.514
Maybe it seemed callous

35:09.516 --> 35:12.683
that I didn't want you
to share it with Eyal.

35:12.685 --> 35:14.318
I'm sure
you had your reasons.

35:14.320 --> 35:16.120
There were
intelligence reasons, yes,

35:16.122 --> 35:17.621
but there were
other reasons too.

35:17.623 --> 35:18.955
I...

35:18.957 --> 35:21.324
I see how close
the two of you are.

35:21.326 --> 35:23.860
We've run a lot
of missions together.

35:23.862 --> 35:27.197
And I know that kinship
can be comforting,

35:27.199 --> 35:30.367
but he works
for a competing service, Annie.

35:30.369 --> 35:32.068
I understand that.

35:32.070 --> 35:36.707
And I just didn't want to see
this becoming a pattern.

35:36.709 --> 35:39.010
What I mean is...

35:39.012 --> 35:41.712
the people you can count on
are here.

35:44.349 --> 35:46.918
Thanks for the award.

35:53.325 --> 35:54.425
Good night, Auggie.

35:54.427 --> 35:56.727
Hey, Tommy,
have you seen Annie?

35:56.729 --> 35:58.662
I think
she just headed home.

35:58.664 --> 36:00.764
Okay, thanks.

36:31.429 --> 36:33.764
What are you doing here?

36:35.434 --> 36:37.702
Well, uh...

36:39.939 --> 36:41.940
Hotels are depressing,
Neshema.

36:41.942 --> 36:44.276
I have something better.

36:44.278 --> 36:46.478
Go get your bag.

36:46.480 --> 36:48.881
I'll wait for you here.

37:11.606 --> 37:12.973
Hi, everybody.

37:12.975 --> 37:14.808
My name is Alison.
I'm an addict.

37:14.810 --> 37:16.309
All:
Hi, Alison.

37:16.311 --> 37:20.681
I have faithfully served
the Central Intelligence Agency

37:20.683 --> 37:22.783
for 16 years.

37:22.785 --> 37:26.120
And it is filled
with my friends.

37:26.122 --> 37:29.356
But the people in this room
are my family.

37:29.358 --> 37:32.426
I'm so grateful
for these meetings

37:32.428 --> 37:36.663
to be able to share
our struggles in the shadows.

37:38.966 --> 37:40.067
I know this trick.

37:40.069 --> 37:42.169
I pulled an apartment
out of a hat

37:42.171 --> 37:44.671
to fool someone once too.

37:44.673 --> 37:45.972
There's no trick.

37:45.974 --> 37:48.441
This is my place in D.C.

37:52.012 --> 37:53.680
You can stay here

37:53.682 --> 37:56.216
until you get yourself
back on your feet.

38:01.022 --> 38:04.023
Eyal, it's too much.

38:04.025 --> 38:05.525
I won't get in your way.

38:05.527 --> 38:07.660
There are fresh sheets
on the bed,

38:07.662 --> 38:09.696
there's food in the fridge,
and, uh...

38:09.698 --> 38:12.198
I've got a flight to catch.

38:12.200 --> 38:13.866
Well, wait.

38:13.868 --> 38:16.402
Stay and eat with me first.

38:18.338 --> 38:20.005
All right.

38:20.007 --> 38:22.408
But I'm cooking.

38:35.556 --> 38:38.057
[Dog barking]
Hey, Walker, you home?

38:38.059 --> 38:40.493
[Insects chirping]

38:46.066 --> 38:48.101
So how long before
your supervisors realize

38:48.103 --> 38:51.504
you shared your intel
with us?

38:51.506 --> 38:55.041
I don't know.
I don't care.

38:55.043 --> 38:58.177
They paired us together
because we work well together.

38:58.179 --> 39:00.514
They can't have it
both ways.

39:00.516 --> 39:02.349
I'm impressed.

39:05.619 --> 39:07.220
You're learning
to work your agency,

39:07.222 --> 39:10.056
show them
you can't be pushed around.

39:12.126 --> 39:13.393
You had me, you know.

39:13.395 --> 39:15.896
When Griffin was running away,

39:15.898 --> 39:18.965
you could've kept that watch
for yourself.

39:18.967 --> 39:20.600
Why share it with Mossad?

39:20.602 --> 39:23.971
I didn't share it
with Mossad.

39:23.973 --> 39:25.706
I shared it with you.

39:31.645 --> 39:33.079
Good night, Annie.
