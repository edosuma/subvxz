"It is with love that I do this.
God's will be done." Alyce Parker.

02:25.479 --> 02:28.095
Please God, watch
over my babies.

02:28.420 --> 02:30.420
Please just come home again.

02:36.865 --> 02:38.763
- Hey.
- How's it goin'?

02:38.788 --> 02:40.034
This way.

02:41.036 --> 02:42.771
Put it down over here.

03:03.517 --> 03:06.268
Can I help you, Mrs. Parker?

03:11.483 --> 03:15.820
Mrs. Parker? Mrs. Parker?

03:15.987 --> 03:19.699
Mrs. Parker, can I help you?

03:22.577 --> 03:27.036
- You okay? - It's the
dampness, it, uh...

03:27.561 --> 03:29.561
gets in my head.

03:31.294 --> 03:34.797
It's gonna get a lot worse
before it gets better.

05:27.828 --> 05:32.540
- Snap Pops! - Sorry,
buddy, no Snap Pops.

05:32.707 --> 05:37.294
- Snap Pops. - It's the first day
with abstinence. You know the rules.

05:37.420 --> 05:40.339
- Snap Pops.
- Milk or tea.

05:40.507 --> 05:42.673
Sorry, honey, it's only
till after Sunday.

05:42.698 --> 05:46.321
- Why? - Because it's the fast,
which means that we can't eat.

05:46.388 --> 05:49.515
No flesh, no fruit, no grain.

05:50.392 --> 05:53.227
Drink your milk,
it'll fill you up.

05:57.148 --> 06:00.985
Now, don't chug it, it's
gonna give you a belly ache.

06:08.618 --> 06:11.996
I don't know what she was thinking,
leaving those clothes out like that.

06:12.163 --> 06:15.053
Her headaches have
been getting worse.

06:16.042 --> 06:19.957
I wish Daddy would let
her see a doctor.

06:21.047 --> 06:24.373
You know how he
feels about that.

07:57.310 --> 08:01.397
Mr Parker? Mr Parker.

08:05.193 --> 08:07.987
Stay here.

08:11.992 --> 08:14.660
Daddy!

09:16.848 --> 09:19.725
Spit it out.

10:11.236 --> 10:15.434
- Hey.
- Hi, Doc.

10:25.750 --> 10:28.993
I'm so sorry I'm late.
The roads are a mess.

10:29.860 --> 10:31.205
I'm Doc Barrow.

10:31.247 --> 10:36.626
We know. You delivered our baby
brother, Rory, up at the house.

10:37.303 --> 10:41.765
- Oh yeah, Rory, little Rory. How
is he? - He's, um... getting big.

10:41.933 --> 10:46.036
Good. Where is your father?

10:47.147 --> 10:51.857
He couldn't make it.
He's still grieving.

10:52.318 --> 10:56.155
Well I can understand that,
sweetie. It's tough.

10:57.031 --> 11:00.043
- They said that she drowned.
- Well, I won't

11:00.056 --> 11:03.078
know, hon, until I do
a full examination.

11:03.246 --> 11:05.271
You mean autopsy.

11:06.697 --> 11:10.065
Yes, an autopsy. It's the law.

11:10.077 --> 11:12.768
You know, I'm so sorry,
it's been a long time, and

11:12.781 --> 11:15.482
you've grown so much, I just
can't remember your name.

11:16.384 --> 11:18.830
- Iris.
- Iris. And you?

11:18.853 --> 11:21.753
- Rose.
- Iris and Rose.

11:22.315 --> 11:27.478
Well, I only need one of you
to make the identification.

11:29.272 --> 11:31.271
I'll do it.

11:33.568 --> 11:37.936
- I'll do it. - Okay.
- This way, sweetie.

11:38.161 --> 11:40.361
Rose, we'll be right back.

12:19.906 --> 12:22.950
Mr Parker?

12:25.161 --> 12:29.059
Mr. Parker, it's wet out here.

12:33.753 --> 12:36.630
She's in a better
place, Mr. Parker.

12:38.341 --> 12:44.554
We say that. Do we believe it?

13:16.421 --> 13:20.048
Emma Parker. 47 years old.

13:21.509 --> 13:28.849
Liver healthy. Moderate calcification
on the left ventricular arteries.

13:34.731 --> 13:37.733
Sign of pill rolling.

13:46.576 --> 13:51.079
Atrophy of right
vastus lateralis

13:51.247 --> 13:55.250
- suggesting early
onset of Parkinson's.

14:15.355 --> 14:18.440
What about Lamb's Day, Daddy?

14:20.276 --> 14:23.737
We do it the way that
we've always done it.

14:26.157 --> 14:30.160
Two days, and we will carry on.

14:31.329 --> 14:34.373
But Mama's gone.

14:35.583 --> 14:38.293
What?

14:39.504 --> 14:45.550
- Mama's gone. - It's what
we do, Rose. We continue.

14:47.136 --> 14:52.099
Iris is the eldest daughter.
It's her responsibility now.

15:03.403 --> 15:06.822
Tree's down. Creek's
washed out.

15:09.283 --> 15:11.280
Fetch some candles, Rose.

15:11.826 --> 15:14.755
I'll let them know what's going
on down at the trailer park.

15:24.006 --> 15:29.052
You're not a'scared, are you?
Are you scared?

15:29.220 --> 15:32.071
Don't be scared.

15:37.061 --> 15:40.647
♪ Jesus gonna be here ♪

15:40.672 --> 15:44.598
♪ Oh, He gonna be here soon ♪

15:45.023 --> 15:48.166
♪ Jesus gonna be here ♪

15:49.091 --> 15:51.317
♪ He gonna be here soon ♪

15:51.342 --> 15:54.121
- When is Jesus gonna be here?
- Soon.

15:54.146 --> 15:55.704
Yeah, He's gonna be here soon.

15:55.705 --> 15:58.999
That's my boy.

17:39.850 --> 17:42.169
Sing it.

17:43.394 --> 17:45.694
- Shhh.
- Sing it.

18:22.268 --> 18:25.395
Daddy's home.

20:36.135 --> 20:38.803
What is it, boy?

20:44.428 --> 20:46.128
Huh.

20:54.462 --> 20:56.546
Come on, come on.

21:10.686 --> 21:16.072
Mr. and Mrs. Kimble, uh... in these
situations, 99 times out of a hundred

21:16.442 --> 21:20.236
the missing person is safe, just
can't get to a working phone.

21:20.362 --> 21:23.007
Your daughter's probably at
somebody's house, a friend's

21:23.020 --> 21:25.675
house, just as worried about
you as you are about her.

21:25.785 --> 21:30.804
But, uh, she's our only child, and
she never hasn't come home before.

21:30.856 --> 21:36.403
I understand that, but I got... I got
roads closed, lines down, bridges out.

21:36.796 --> 21:40.037
Let's give it 24 hours. If
she doesn't make contact

21:40.050 --> 21:43.301
by then, we'll, uh, we'll
put out an alert. Okay?

21:50.184 --> 21:51.535
Emily!

21:53.313 --> 21:55.516
I need you to make copies
of that photo, and

21:55.529 --> 21:57.743
put out an MPR on a Valerie
Kimble, all right?

21:58.526 --> 22:01.319
I'm on it.

22:04.114 --> 22:06.199
Thank you.

22:58.711 --> 23:02.139
I'm sorry, I know it's a
bad time for you, but...

23:02.680 --> 23:05.953
uh, I'm finished with
this place, uh...

23:06.927 --> 23:12.515
There's no work, and now this damn
storm washed half the town away,

23:12.683 --> 23:19.480
so, we're gonna head down-state to my
brother's and see if we can start over.

23:19.648 --> 23:23.693
I think that's everything.
Good luck, Mr. Parker.

24:03.859 --> 24:06.945
I'm hungry.

24:20.793 --> 24:23.127
Snap pops.

24:45.409 --> 24:46.926
It's for you.

24:48.218 --> 24:53.703
- I don't underst... - A
token to... for last night.

24:55.744 --> 24:59.491
"Kindness shall be
met with kindness."

25:00.791 --> 25:04.432
- Is that in the Bible?
- It's in mine.

25:05.295 --> 25:09.465
- Thank you. - The funeral
is this afternoon.

25:09.633 --> 25:13.177
- So soon?
- It's our way.

25:13.345 --> 25:19.183
I don't like to ask, I was wonderin' if you
wouldn't mind watchin' my boy for a spell.

25:20.227 --> 25:25.356
- Too young for these things.
- Of course I wouldn't mind.

25:26.400 --> 25:30.695
I'd be happy to, Mr. Parker.

25:38.871 --> 25:42.174
<i>This is Sheriff Meeks. I'm not
here right now, please leave</i>

25:42.187 --> 25:45.501
<i>a message and I'll get back
to you as soon as possible.</i>

25:45.669 --> 25:48.713
Hey, Bob. Doc Barrow here.

25:48.881 --> 25:51.575
I found something strange
this morning, my dog

25:51.588 --> 25:54.293
actually dug it up, I'd
like to show it to you.

25:54.361 --> 26:01.367
I can stop by your place today, if it's
okay. Let me know, please. Thanks.

26:03.896 --> 26:06.856
Where are you, Pumpkin?

26:23.165 --> 26:28.920
You're gonna have to take care
of them now. You ready for that?

26:29.088 --> 26:34.841
I'm the eldest. That's the way it
works. The way it's always worked.

26:34.961 --> 26:38.152
It just... doesn't seem fair.

26:39.095 --> 26:40.517
None of it.

26:41.016 --> 26:45.106
That's for me to worry
about, not you.

26:47.898 --> 26:54.255
What if we refused to do it?
We just... we just stopped?

27:00.035 --> 27:04.163
- He would make us, wouldn't he?
- I just wanna get this over with.

27:04.331 --> 27:07.226
And then we have a whole year
to figure something out.

27:14.424 --> 27:20.221
- I just wish we were like
everyone else. - Well, we're not.

29:03.242 --> 29:06.420
- What are you doing? You
know you ain't allowed

29:06.433 --> 29:09.622
down here! - I seen
the monster, Daddy.

29:14.086 --> 29:21.425
One day, I'll teach you how not to be
afraid of the dark. How'd that be?

29:21.593 --> 29:26.681
- Good. - Until
then, you stay out.

29:26.807 --> 29:32.561
Don't go where you don't belong.
Okay?

29:49.413 --> 29:55.918
- You always need a watchful eye. - I'm
sorry, Daddy. Rose said he was sleeping.

29:56.086 --> 30:03.050
Rose isn't in charge. You are.
All we have is each other.

30:03.218 --> 30:08.139
We need to stick together now.
You understand?

30:14.521 --> 30:19.025
"And the seed shall become the
tree, which bears the fruit."

30:21.320 --> 30:24.864
- "And feeds the
kindred. Amen." - Amen.

30:56.313 --> 31:04.028
When the Earth has claimed our limbs,
then shall we come home to walk with Him.

31:04.196 --> 31:07.114
To the better place He calls us,

31:07.282 --> 31:12.244
free from want, and hungry
desires of this Earth.

31:14.414 --> 31:21.462
But should some urgent
fate, untimely lot,

31:21.630 --> 31:25.049
bring you to meet your fate,

31:25.217 --> 31:31.013
nameless out the haunt that the lone
regions where has drawed no foot of man,

31:31.181 --> 31:34.642
commend myself to God.

31:35.977 --> 31:42.066
Behold, the Lamb of God, who
taketh away the sins of the world.

31:43.402 --> 31:46.654
- Amen.
- Amen.

32:16.560 --> 32:20.771
He hasn't eaten... since Mama...

32:22.941 --> 32:25.570
Take him home, put him to
bed, let him get some rest.

32:25.647 --> 32:28.798
If he wants something to eat, give him
something light, like soup or something.

32:30.740 --> 32:35.828
- I'll call you tomorrow.
- I'm sorry, Iris.

32:35.954 --> 32:41.208
Thank you for coming, Anders.
It was really sweet of you.

32:52.679 --> 32:56.515
No, no hon... she didn't
suffer at all, no.

33:26.171 --> 33:28.969
We're home, Daddy.

33:41.269 --> 33:46.690
She was the first. Now
it belongs to you.

33:55.367 --> 33:59.245
December 24th, 1781.

33:59.412 --> 34:01.820
Papa has found our new home.

34:02.120 --> 34:06.664
It is a peaceful place, high on a
mountain overlooking the valley below.

34:06.836 --> 34:12.675
The forest is rich with serenity. The
land, it knows not the industry of men.

34:14.052 --> 34:18.138
Our harvest dwindles as
winter approaches early.

34:18.306 --> 34:22.393
Mother has forgone her rations,
so that the children may eat.

34:22.561 --> 34:27.049
Father and Uncle Burnett left
yesterday in search of game.

34:28.567 --> 34:31.995
We pray for their safe
return, as I fear we have

34:32.007 --> 34:35.447
not yet seen the whole
of nature's cruelty.

34:46.822 --> 34:48.483
- Hi.
- Hey.

34:48.579 --> 34:50.684
I hope I'm not bothering
you, but uh...

34:51.087 --> 34:54.349
I wanted to say that
when my dad died...

34:55.135 --> 35:00.097
it was really hard on our
family. Especially my mom.

35:00.265 --> 35:03.517
Where have you been? I
haven't seen you all summer.

35:03.685 --> 35:06.981
Academy training? Down-state?

35:07.939 --> 35:12.401
Yeah, this is my first
official week on the job.

35:12.569 --> 35:17.103
- They made you cut your hair,
huh? - Yeah, academy regulation.

35:17.649 --> 35:22.890
- You wanna come in? - Um...
- No, it's, uh...

35:23.288 --> 35:26.174
it's just... do you
remember a Valerie Kimble?

35:26.726 --> 35:28.586
Mm-hmm.

35:28.752 --> 35:32.294
Yeah, well, uh, have
you seen her lately?

35:32.896 --> 35:34.372
Hmm-mm.

35:34.424 --> 35:38.173
Not since school let out.
She's pretty.

35:38.228 --> 35:43.594
Yeah, well, um, well she's gone missing.
And, uh, it was just before the storm,

35:43.767 --> 35:49.350
so I thought that maybe, since she had to
come by this way on her way home everyday,

35:49.364 --> 35:51.575
that maybe someone had seen her.

35:51.775 --> 35:54.891
Well, you could check
up at the trailer park.

35:54.904 --> 35:58.031
Only the new girl left,
business has been slow.

35:58.064 --> 35:59.892
Yeah, it's been
slow for everybody.

36:00.417 --> 36:03.951
All right, well um, well
I'll go ask her then.

36:10.585 --> 36:17.758
I hope this doesn't come off the wrong way,
you know... I thought that maybe, um...

36:17.926 --> 36:21.688
maybe after everything calmed
down... uh, we could, you

36:21.701 --> 36:25.474
know, we could go to a movie
or somethin' sometime?

36:26.768 --> 36:29.645
- A movie?
- Yeah.

36:29.813 --> 36:35.609
Or... or a restaurant, we could go eat,
you know, whatever you want to do.

36:37.112 --> 36:44.326
- Ask me again some other time, and
we'll see. Okay? - Yeah, of course.

36:44.494 --> 36:49.415
All right. I will... I will...
I'll see you around? I hope.

36:49.582 --> 36:52.049
Not if I see you first.

37:05.056 --> 37:08.670
That's the boy from school
that you liked, isn't it?

37:09.227 --> 37:11.768
He's okay.

37:18.778 --> 37:21.308
Nice haircut.

37:34.335 --> 37:37.629
I don't know what's
keepin' you here, Doc.

37:37.797 --> 37:42.009
What you need is a good long
vacation, someplace warm.

37:42.177 --> 37:49.141
Shit, if I was you, I'd retire and
stay there. She can stay here.

37:50.185 --> 37:54.077
- So what do you think? - Well, it's
been floodin' up at the cemetery.

37:54.154 --> 37:56.546
Hell, but Bob, the cemetery
is downstream from me,

37:56.559 --> 37:58.961
and you know very well
nothing flows upstream.

38:00.695 --> 38:03.697
- How sure are you, Doc?
- I'm not.

38:04.165 --> 38:08.113
We'd have to send it to
Albany, be tested positive.

38:08.114 --> 38:10.195
That's not gonna happen,
not with the flood.

38:10.220 --> 38:11.413
What are we gonna do?

38:11.414 --> 38:13.249
I got a state of emergency here,

38:13.250 --> 38:15.385
I can't start an investigation
based on a piece

38:15.398 --> 38:17.543
of bone, I'm not even
sure that its human.

38:17.962 --> 38:20.698
- I'm not asking that, Bob.
- I know that.

38:22.300 --> 38:26.069
- Come on, Jim, you know
what this is. - What?

38:29.182 --> 38:35.551
- I'm sorry, man. - Aw, it's all
right. - You're probably right.

38:36.022 --> 38:39.775
I'm probably
clutching at straws.

38:41.328 --> 38:47.583
Believe me, when Kimmy disappeared,
we did everything we could.

38:47.951 --> 38:51.703
She was just gone. It happens.

38:51.871 --> 38:55.466
I wish to God it
didn't, but it does.

38:55.991 --> 38:57.991
Yeah...

39:01.589 --> 39:04.967
and the monster lived
happily ever after.

39:05.134 --> 39:07.911
No, he didn't.

39:08.847 --> 39:14.372
- What? - The monster's
not happy. He's crying.

39:15.770 --> 39:21.306
- What do you mean? - I heard him in
the basement, behind the locked door.

39:21.442 --> 39:24.329
He's in there and he's sad.

39:26.948 --> 39:31.743
You hush now, go to sleep, okay?
Good night.

39:53.641 --> 39:56.331
We lost Mrs. Burnett last night.

39:59.856 --> 40:06.199
Mother is weakening by the hour, and I
fear that she will not last the winter.

40:12.160 --> 40:16.788
Father returned to us this morning
with supplies of fresh meat.

40:24.464 --> 40:29.760
Uncle Burnett continued further east
in hope of reaching the outpost.

40:29.928 --> 40:35.098
He has not returned, and I
believe now that he never will.

40:36.643 --> 40:41.396
Father says all is forgiven
in the eyes of the Lord.

40:41.564 --> 40:43.941
Daddy.

40:45.610 --> 40:50.948
What if we were different?
If we weren't like we are?

40:50.973 --> 40:52.416
What?

40:52.617 --> 40:54.743
Come here, honey.

40:59.749 --> 41:02.709
What are we like?

41:04.629 --> 41:08.256
It was God chose
us to be this way.

41:10.677 --> 41:17.140
If we don't do as he asks,
we get sick from the poison.

41:17.308 --> 41:24.690
One by one we'd die. You can't hide
a doubtful mind from him, honey.

41:26.359 --> 41:30.362
He knows all, sees all.

41:31.823 --> 41:35.409
You're stronger than
you know, girl.

41:39.998 --> 41:45.002
I know, Daddy. One more day.

41:48.047 --> 41:54.511
- I love you so much. I love
you so much. - I love you too.

42:10.820 --> 42:13.572
Oh! Excuse me.

42:25.126 --> 42:27.864
- Hey, Doc.
- Mr. Anders.

42:28.878 --> 42:30.828
What kind of bone
you think that is?

42:31.382 --> 42:36.309
- Where'd you find this? - In a
washed-out creek, behind my house.

42:36.763 --> 42:40.891
Definitely not a deer. My dad would've
known, he was real good with bones.

42:41.059 --> 42:46.563
In my humble opinion, I
believe it's human remains.

42:46.731 --> 42:52.944
Well... in that case I take your
word for it, you're a doctor.

42:53.112 --> 42:56.672
Well, I'm here because I
went by to see Meeks, and

42:56.685 --> 43:00.256
told him. He just thinks I'm
some kind of a nut-case,

43:00.828 --> 43:04.392
and he may be right. But...
there's been three

43:04.405 --> 43:07.980
people missing from this
town in the last 20 years,

43:08.080 --> 43:13.751
- one of which was my daughter. - I know,
I remember. I was on the search party.

43:14.476 --> 43:15.876
Yeah, I know.

43:16.094 --> 43:19.356
But... if you extend the
radius including the towns

43:19.369 --> 43:22.641
within 50 miles, there are
30 people or more missing,

43:22.809 --> 43:26.937
- none of which have been
found. - I'm just a deputy.

43:28.856 --> 43:33.735
Oh, I know, I'm just trying to help out. I
thought, maybe it'd be useful information.

43:40.535 --> 43:46.623
Boy, there are good folk
in this town. Nice people.

43:47.667 --> 43:52.002
Those girls just put their
mother down, just died recently,

43:52.486 --> 43:54.595
and down here to help out.

43:54.731 --> 43:57.330
The father is a bit of a
whacko, if you ask me.

43:57.385 --> 44:02.507
Hey guys, on the house. We got the power
back up, but one of our fridges won't start

44:02.508 --> 44:04.982
so we have to eat everything
up before it spoils.

44:05.082 --> 44:07.108
- Could I have a cup of
coffee, sweetie? - Sure.

44:08.043 --> 44:11.471
I'll tell you what, Doc,
how about I come over

44:11.484 --> 44:14.923
tomorrow and you can show
me where you found this.

44:22.660 --> 44:26.214
- He woke up sick and
then got all hot. - Oh,

44:26.227 --> 44:29.791
he just has a fever.
Children get fevers.

44:29.959 --> 44:32.134
- Do you have any aspirin?
- Yes.

44:32.160 --> 44:34.684
Can you crush one up in a
glass of milk, please?

44:34.755 --> 44:39.006
- Oh, and make sure you crush it
really good. - Is he gonna be okay?

44:39.279 --> 44:42.602
Oh yeah, he'll be fine. We just gotta
get him out of these wet clothes.

44:43.045 --> 44:45.114
Sweetheart, do you have
some fresh things for him?

44:45.139 --> 44:47.100
Uh, yeah, I think.

44:49.854 --> 44:52.355
You poor little thing.

45:00.281 --> 45:03.200
You're so sweet.

45:15.072 --> 45:16.399
Ow!

45:17.298 --> 45:19.716
I'm hungry.

45:22.094 --> 45:25.472
What's goin' on?

45:28.434 --> 45:34.022
- Eh... he's got a fever. - It's
a wonder we ain't all sick.

45:34.190 --> 45:36.816
All this damn rain
gets in the bones.

45:41.197 --> 45:43.949
You a good neighbor, Marge.

45:49.080 --> 45:51.561
I'll see you out.

45:55.503 --> 46:00.215
- Listen, maybe you oughta take him to see
a doctor? - That costs money we ain't got.

46:00.383 --> 46:05.670
We ain't used to sickness in this
house. He'll burn it off, be fine.

46:05.864 --> 46:08.148
- Good day, Marge.
- You're bleeding.

46:14.397 --> 46:21.278
Well, look at that. It must be dried
out from the stove in the shed.

46:28.119 --> 46:33.790
It's the Maker,
tellin' us it's time.

46:51.726 --> 46:57.272
Mama has gone to the Lord. Now
it is just the three of us.

46:58.733 --> 47:02.152
Father has changed greatly
these past few weeks.

47:02.320 --> 47:05.227
He keeps to himself in
a back chamber of the

47:05.240 --> 47:08.158
cave, quoting scripture
and weeping at night.

47:08.326 --> 47:12.454
I suspect I know the great
secret father has kept from us.

47:12.621 --> 47:18.543
As father's mind unravels, our
survival has now become my burden.

49:46.192 --> 49:50.528
It is with love that I do this.
God's will be done.

49:50.696 --> 49:56.201
Alyce Parker.
Lamb's Day, 1782.

50:10.049 --> 50:13.760
We're gonna have to
call the Kimbles.

50:33.572 --> 50:36.324
Hold this.

51:40.222 --> 51:42.307
Help me.

51:42.474 --> 51:46.519
- Help me. - I can't do this!
- I can't...

51:46.687 --> 51:50.868
- We have no choice now. - You're
gonna leave me for that police boy.

51:50.869 --> 51:55.300
Nothing comes between this
family. Okay? Nothing!

51:55.946 --> 52:00.408
I need you. I can
not do this alone.

52:00.576 --> 52:04.579
Please help me, Rose.
Go, please help me!

52:45.454 --> 52:50.708
I'm sorry, Mrs. Stratton. I promise
you're going to a better place.

52:53.837 --> 53:00.593
Get off me!

53:23.117 --> 53:28.830
Iris, make it stop. Make it stop! Would
you please make it stop. Please!

53:28.997 --> 53:31.374
Please, Iris! Please,
please, please...

53:37.840 --> 53:41.968
- Did you kill the monster?
- Yeah, yeah. Yes I did. Yes.

57:21.605 --> 57:24.357
Tell Daddy supper is ready.

57:32.282 --> 57:35.518
Are you okay?

57:40.082 --> 57:44.168
I didn't know it was
gonna be like that.

57:50.801 --> 57:53.366
I won't do that again.

57:55.054 --> 57:57.774
He can't make me.

57:59.393 --> 58:02.117
Nobody can, not even God.

58:19.871 --> 58:25.626
- Hi! I came by to see how the little
man is doing. - He's fine. Better.

58:26.795 --> 58:31.395
I brought you some lasagna. Have to
use it before it goes bad, so...

58:31.625 --> 58:32.900
It's vegetarian.

58:34.052 --> 58:40.141
- Sweet of you. - I heard somebody
down in the shed earlier.

58:40.608 --> 58:46.170
It must've been Daddy. He's the
only one allowed down there. Ever.

58:46.523 --> 58:50.609
Well, it sounded
like a girl, crying.

58:53.280 --> 58:57.700
I don't know what you think you
heard, but you must be mistaken.

58:59.995 --> 59:01.829
Thanks. Good night.

59:03.623 --> 59:06.250
Good night.

59:51.421 --> 59:55.341
Thank you for the
sustenance we receive.

59:56.885 --> 01:00:03.516
Blessed are the lamb, for
they are his offering. Amen.

01:00:03.642 --> 01:00:05.643
Amen.

01:00:26.456 --> 01:00:29.041
It's good.

01:00:31.419 --> 01:00:34.130
Your mother would be proud.

01:00:41.221 --> 01:00:46.892
- Eat your food, Rose.
- Yes, Daddy. It's just hot.

01:00:47.894 --> 01:00:49.645
Blow on it.

01:00:57.529 --> 01:01:04.326
It takes more than a flood to
bring this family to its knees.

01:01:40.739 --> 01:01:47.036
- It looks like pot glow.
- And what is pot glow?

01:01:47.204 --> 01:01:49.643
Means it's been boiled.

01:01:50.847 --> 01:01:52.712
Listen, you find anything
else you give me a

01:01:52.725 --> 01:01:54.601
call. I'll be at my
office at the morgue.

01:01:55.503 --> 01:01:59.215
- Fuckin' "pot glow."
- Thanks!

01:02:31.623 --> 01:02:35.709
Iris! Iris, wake up!

01:02:35.835 --> 01:02:37.378
Get up.

01:02:53.812 --> 01:02:56.662
You should call a girl when
you're gonna make a visit.

01:02:57.776 --> 01:02:59.099
Morning, Iris.

01:02:59.142 --> 01:03:04.838
- What are you doing in my creek, Anders?
- Wastin' my time, gettin' my feet wet.

01:03:04.906 --> 01:03:08.534
I don't mind so much now
that you're around.

01:03:13.790 --> 01:03:18.752
- I can get you a pair of my
daddy's socks. - You think so?

01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:21.922
I know so. Come on up.

01:03:47.907 --> 01:03:53.078
So... what are you looking for?

01:03:54.122 --> 01:03:59.201
I, uh... I probably shouldn't
say, it's nothing.

01:03:59.269 --> 01:04:04.648
You can tell me. Hell, you were
the first boy I ever kissed.

01:04:04.716 --> 01:04:11.555
- You prob'ly don't remember though,
do you? - No, no... I remember.

01:04:13.433 --> 01:04:19.355
So, you can tell me...
what are you looking for?

01:04:27.405 --> 01:04:34.787
The storm just washed some
things way down creek.

01:04:35.997 --> 01:04:41.149
- Well, what kind of things?
- Bones.

01:04:44.005 --> 01:04:49.551
We been findin' bones 'round here since I
was a little girl. Deer and 'coons, mostly.

01:04:49.719 --> 01:04:55.140
- No, but Doc Barrow thinks that these
are human. - You're just funnin' me.

01:04:55.308 --> 01:04:57.893
No, I swear to God,
that's what he thinks.

01:04:59.062 --> 01:05:04.650
But the sheriff, he's not buyin'
it, so... so I don't know.

01:05:05.693 --> 01:05:08.695
Let me get you those socks.

01:05:19.999 --> 01:05:27.047
Hey, uh... Hey Iris, could
I get a glass of water?

01:05:27.215 --> 01:05:29.383
Iris?

01:05:47.318 --> 01:05:51.363
- Jesus! - What are you doing
here, Anders? - Something wrong?

01:05:51.531 --> 01:05:55.117
No. No, uh, I just
got my socks wet.

01:05:55.285 --> 01:06:00.255
- Iris was gettin' me a dry pair
from upstairs. - What is that?

01:06:01.132 --> 01:06:04.060
It looks like some
sort of old tooth or

01:06:04.073 --> 01:06:07.012
something. I found it out
in the creek. Thanks.

01:06:15.096 --> 01:06:18.686
So, how old are you now, Rose?

01:06:19.150 --> 01:06:21.079
- Fourteen.
- Fourteen...

01:06:21.853 --> 01:06:26.231
- You're growin' up.
- It happens.

01:06:26.399 --> 01:06:29.776
Yes, it does.

01:06:32.489 --> 01:06:34.948
Catch.

01:06:35.074 --> 01:06:37.159
Ah, thank you.

01:06:38.244 --> 01:06:41.538
- What's this? - Some kind of
bone, I found it out back.

01:06:41.706 --> 01:06:45.066
My Daddy would know,
he's good with bones.

01:06:46.113 --> 01:06:47.902
So was mine.

01:06:48.137 --> 01:06:51.483
You know, there's an old family
cemetery up the creek a bit.

01:06:51.834 --> 01:06:54.301
We used to go there
when we were little.

01:06:54.344 --> 01:06:57.971
- There are even some
stones left. - How far?

01:06:58.139 --> 01:07:01.847
- Not far. Just below the falls.
- Maybe, uh, maybe I should take a look.

01:07:01.943 --> 01:07:04.835
This could be from one
of our relatives.

01:07:05.813 --> 01:07:09.983
- I'll show you where it is.
- Okay, I'd appreciate that.

01:07:10.109 --> 01:07:14.570
You're growin' up really pretty,
Rose. Just like your sister.

01:07:15.195 --> 01:07:17.195
I'll see you later.

01:07:18.159 --> 01:07:20.757
See you.

01:08:06.583 --> 01:08:10.377
I think your sister's worried
that I'm gonna steal you away.

01:08:10.545 --> 01:08:13.213
Are you?

01:08:16.134 --> 01:08:18.385
Listen.

01:08:19.429 --> 01:08:22.014
What?

01:08:28.729 --> 01:08:35.611
My daddy called them heat bugs.
Means summer is coming.

01:08:43.886 --> 01:08:45.886
Oh...

01:08:45.912 --> 01:08:48.122
Damn it.

01:09:05.725 --> 01:09:08.560
What?

01:09:09.645 --> 01:09:16.026
Nothing. Come on,
we're almost there.

01:09:35.630 --> 01:09:41.801
Some have signs of scorching,
and Y-shaped patterns,

01:09:41.969 --> 01:09:45.846
indicating a serrated blade.

01:09:46.015 --> 01:09:51.269
T-structured incisions,
indicating a flat blade,

01:09:51.437 --> 01:09:55.357
for scraping or fileting
tissue from bone.

01:10:44.574 --> 01:10:49.536
- This is all your dad's
land, huh? - Mm-hmm.

01:11:50.932 --> 01:11:53.642
Don't.

01:11:53.810 --> 01:11:57.395
Why? It's just a flower.

01:11:59.357 --> 01:12:06.279
I'm not worth it, Anders. I'm
not what you think I am.

01:12:06.447 --> 01:12:10.152
I don't think you're
anything but a pretty girl,

01:12:11.366 --> 01:12:13.985
who I like a lot.

01:12:15.039 --> 01:12:18.708
- I'm not pretty.
- Yes, you are.

01:12:18.876 --> 01:12:23.960
- Not inside. - Maybe I
should just take you home.

01:14:18.579 --> 01:14:21.998
You're filth. Rory's alone.

01:14:22.166 --> 01:14:25.866
I don't know where your
sister's made off to. You

01:14:25.879 --> 01:14:29.589
get your ass home and
look after your brother.

01:14:29.757 --> 01:14:31.883
Now!

01:15:14.260 --> 01:15:17.971
Get out of my sight.
Both of you.

01:15:36.198 --> 01:15:40.884
<i>Hi, you've reached Deputy Anders.
Sorry, I can't get to the...</i>

01:15:46.042 --> 01:15:49.776
<i>This is Sheriff Meeks. I'm
not here right now...</i>

01:15:57.344 --> 01:16:00.256
We'll take the truck
once he's asleep. Then

01:16:00.269 --> 01:16:03.192
we'll head to the city
and just start all over.

01:16:04.067 --> 01:16:08.110
Just stop, okay?
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:16:08.189 --> 01:16:10.468
You're so beautiful.

01:16:12.210 --> 01:16:13.810
Okay?

01:16:14.236 --> 01:16:18.740
You're gonna be fine.
We're gonna be... fine.

01:16:21.365 --> 01:16:25.068
Shh... It's okay.

01:16:34.965 --> 01:16:37.008
Daddy's mad.

01:16:37.176 --> 01:16:43.306
The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want.
He ​​maketh me lie down in green pastures.

01:16:43.474 --> 01:16:46.893
He leadeth me in paths of
righteousness for His name's sake.

01:16:47.061 --> 01:16:51.981
Yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death, I fear no evil.

01:16:52.149 --> 01:16:56.569
For He is with me. His rod and
His staff, they comfort me.

01:16:56.737 --> 01:17:01.324
Surely goodness and mercy...

01:18:37.338 --> 01:18:39.781
- Hi, Emily.
- Hey, Doc.

01:18:39.782 --> 01:18:42.398
- Is Anders in? - Ah,
nope, just me.

01:18:42.399 --> 01:18:44.497
I've been tryin' to
call him all afternoon.

01:18:44.510 --> 01:18:46.618
There's a new storm
comin', bad reception.

01:18:46.643 --> 01:18:47.931
He might be over
at the fireworks.

01:18:47.932 --> 01:18:51.676
- Is Meeks in? - He's out
on call, accident on 28.

01:18:51.677 --> 01:18:54.886
Listen hon, would you... would you
mind watchin' my dog for a bit?

01:18:54.951 --> 01:18:57.960
Ah! Oh my goodness!
He's so cute!

01:18:58.011 --> 01:19:00.605
- I left something in
Meeks' office, can I get

01:19:00.618 --> 01:19:03.223
it? - Oh, yeah, door's unlocked.
Help yourself.

01:19:32.559 --> 01:19:35.367
- Okay, thanks. You be a good dog,
Zip. - Did you get what you needed?

01:19:35.392 --> 01:19:37.392
- Yes, I did. Thank you
so much. - Oh good.

01:19:44.989 --> 01:19:48.402
- Have you seen Deputy Anders?
- No, not today.

01:19:51.795 --> 01:19:53.493
You haven't seen Deputy
Anders, have you?

01:19:53.505 --> 01:19:58.304
Emma, I have seen the signs.
We're comin' home to you now.

01:19:59.129 --> 01:20:01.224
Comin' home to you now.

01:20:03.527 --> 01:20:04.938
Comin' home to you now, sweetie.

01:20:05.038 --> 01:20:08.132
- Is Meeks around? - I
haven't seen Meeks in...

01:20:08.137 --> 01:20:15.018
Father, we have kept our
tradition in its purity,

01:20:15.485 --> 01:20:18.696
we seek our reward
in the hereafter.

01:20:39.293 --> 01:20:43.157
Oh, come on, Kidd. Come
on, buddy, let's go.

01:20:43.839 --> 01:20:47.967
Come on, let's go. Good boy.

01:20:49.303 --> 01:20:51.086
Pretty, isn't it?

01:20:52.133 --> 01:20:57.268
Honey, listen to me. You're gonna
have to be a brave boy, okay?

01:20:58.270 --> 01:21:04.359
You're gonna have to listen to me, and do
what I say when I say it. Can you do that?

01:21:04.526 --> 01:21:07.195
All right? That's a
good little man.

01:21:07.363 --> 01:21:10.531
Get ready for supper.

01:21:23.253 --> 01:21:26.172
Good boy, Kidd.

01:24:35.355 --> 01:24:36.646
Iris.

01:24:45.281 --> 01:24:47.324
Iris.

01:25:00.846 --> 01:25:07.476
Father, lift us from this
world of goatishness,

01:25:07.644 --> 01:25:12.106
together, as one

01:25:12.274 --> 01:25:16.193
and raise us to righteousness
and heavenly laity.

01:25:17.321 --> 01:25:22.575
We have kept our
tradition in its purity,

01:25:22.743 --> 01:25:28.873
and seek our reward in
the hereafter. Amen.

01:25:31.034 --> 01:25:36.080
We were lost, like the lambs.

01:25:37.132 --> 01:25:40.794
But have found the light
that will lead us home.

01:25:45.390 --> 01:25:47.642
Let us eat.

01:25:51.188 --> 01:25:53.905
Iris.

01:26:41.565 --> 01:26:43.385
Iris.

01:26:43.444 --> 01:26:45.320
- Yes?
- Get the door.

01:26:53.750 --> 01:26:57.461
- I need to see your father.
- Come in.

01:27:02.676 --> 01:27:06.303
- Dr. Barrow.
- Mr. Parker.

01:27:07.431 --> 01:27:11.091
You hungry, Doc?
We have plenty.

01:27:12.644 --> 01:27:16.526
- No thank you.
- What's on your mind?

01:27:19.234 --> 01:27:25.906
- Well, it's rather indelicate. - Leave
me and the doctor have some privacy.

01:27:35.125 --> 01:27:38.002
Let there be light.

01:27:46.662 --> 01:27:49.914
Mind if I smoke, Doc?

01:27:56.938 --> 01:28:00.301
How long have you had that
hand tremor, Mr. Parker?

01:28:04.279 --> 01:28:08.949
You didn't come here to discuss
my health, did you, Doc?

01:28:10.702 --> 01:28:14.580
- No, I didn't.
- What then?

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:20.503
- Have you seen Anders?
- Who?

01:28:20.670 --> 01:28:23.339
The Deputy. Anders.

01:28:23.507 --> 01:28:27.885
Oh. Yeah, yeah.

01:28:28.053 --> 01:28:31.972
- Was he here?
- This morning.

01:28:34.976 --> 01:28:37.061
But he left.

01:28:47.823 --> 01:28:53.035
- Is there anything else?
- Yes, matter of fact.

01:28:54.454 --> 01:29:01.377
Your wife suffered from a rare
disorder of prion disease.

01:29:04.965 --> 01:29:09.464
It's usually found in the
native tribes of New Guinea.

01:29:11.721 --> 01:29:14.636
And it comes from
eating human flesh.

01:29:22.357 --> 01:29:24.928
Did you kill my daughter?

01:29:25.504 --> 01:29:28.212
Mmm... what?

01:29:28.238 --> 01:29:30.960
Your daughter's
wearing a hair clasp,

01:29:31.340 --> 01:29:35.144
that was a gift to my
girl when she turned 16.

01:29:36.413 --> 01:29:41.876
Did you eat my daughter?

01:29:45.714 --> 01:29:48.324
I been meanin' to ask you, um...

01:29:49.301 --> 01:29:52.092
are you a religious man, Doc?

01:29:52.118 --> 01:29:54.738
Tell me about my daughter.

01:29:56.683 --> 01:29:59.296
It's not too popular
these days, is it?

01:29:59.297 --> 01:30:01.481
Tell me about my daughter.

01:30:03.565 --> 01:30:06.625
Tell me about my daughter!

01:30:06.993 --> 01:30:09.077
Daddy! No!

01:30:35.211 --> 01:30:38.009
Son of a bitch!

01:30:50.445 --> 01:30:54.683
Come here, sweetie.
You're gonna be okay.

01:30:54.708 --> 01:30:56.708
Don't you move,

01:30:57.160 --> 01:31:01.956
you're gonna be all right.
Don't you go anywhere.

01:31:09.297 --> 01:31:13.801
I'm sorry, honey. I love you.

01:31:13.969 --> 01:31:17.946
I'm gonna go get your... your
brother and your sister.

01:31:24.731 --> 01:31:26.231
Get in.

01:31:27.857 --> 01:31:30.067
Come on, let's go.

01:31:37.909 --> 01:31:40.244
Get out, get out!

01:31:50.755 --> 01:31:55.959
Marge! Marge! Marge! Marge!
Please open up!

01:31:56.027 --> 01:31:59.029
Marge! Please open up!
Open up!

01:31:59.097 --> 01:32:00.681
Marge! Please!

01:32:06.312 --> 01:32:08.900
What the fuck is happening?

01:33:25.768 --> 01:33:27.093
Rory.

01:33:28.394 --> 01:33:30.321
Come on.

01:33:31.731 --> 01:33:36.110
Come on. It's all right.
It's okay.

01:33:36.277 --> 01:33:39.196
I'm sorry. Rory,

01:33:39.364 --> 01:33:45.661
Please, come on. You don't have to be
afraid of the dark. I'll teach you.

01:33:49.154 --> 01:33:52.400
I'll teach you. I'll teach you.

01:33:56.756 --> 01:33:59.455
- Rose.
- No.

01:33:59.480 --> 01:34:00.843
- It's okay.
- No.

01:34:00.844 --> 01:34:05.889
- Come home now.
- No. No.

01:34:07.990 --> 01:34:12.785
Iris needs you. Iris
needs you, now come on.

01:34:13.898 --> 01:34:17.734
- Iris?
- Iris needs you.

01:34:18.220 --> 01:34:22.305
Yeah, she's safe. Come on.

01:34:22.530 --> 01:34:24.629
Come on. It's okay.

01:34:26.244 --> 01:34:30.914
Come on. Yeah, that'a girl.
It's okay.

01:34:32.939 --> 01:34:34.939
I'll take care of you.

01:35:36.147 --> 01:35:41.818
All is forgiven, in
the eyes of the Lord.

01:36:00.004 --> 01:36:02.440
You look just like your mother.

01:36:06.376 --> 01:36:11.654
Shhh... shhh...

01:36:14.602 --> 01:36:18.272
No reason to cry.
No reason to cry.

01:36:21.497 --> 01:36:23.497
Shhh...

01:36:27.156 --> 01:36:30.826
- I love you, Daddy. - I
love you too, Rose.
