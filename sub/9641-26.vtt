WEBVTT

00:07.458 --> 00:08.708
Where is Max?

00:08.708 --> 00:10.416
I want to start
the meeting.

00:10.416 --> 00:13.458
My money's on
"stuck in a well."

00:13.458 --> 00:15.625
Why would Max
be stuck in a well?

00:15.625 --> 00:17.250
Because I put
a well in his room.

00:20.375 --> 00:21.750
Guys, so sorry I'm late.

00:21.750 --> 00:24.333
I got stuck in a well.

00:26.291 --> 00:28.250
And thank you to Alex,
I don't have to leave my room

00:28.250 --> 00:30.000
to get a drink
of water anymore.

00:31.875 --> 00:35.750
Alex, go up to your brother's
room and get rid of that well.

00:35.750 --> 00:38.291
But save the water, 'cause
we need to make ice cubes.

00:38.291 --> 00:43.250
OK. I'll save the wood, too,
so you can turn it into pulp
and make napkins.

00:43.250 --> 00:45.708
Hey...
that is a great idea.

00:45.708 --> 00:46.875
You get on that!

00:48.291 --> 00:51.458
OK, tomorrow is
your mother's birthday.

00:51.458 --> 00:54.333
Oh, do you guys give
her magical gifts?

00:54.333 --> 00:56.833
You know Mom and magic.
Not a fan.

00:56.833 --> 01:00.333
Great. I can give her
my "I hate magic" t-shirt.

01:05.958 --> 01:07.208
Yeah, she'd probably like that.

01:07.208 --> 01:09.000
There's this whole shelf
of magical gifts

01:09.000 --> 01:11.291
Uncle Kelbo gave her and
she never even opened 'em.

01:11.291 --> 01:12.750
Let me guess,
Alex opened them?

01:12.750 --> 01:13.833
Kuh-ah-ah!

01:15.416 --> 01:17.583
Alex does not
know about this shelf.

01:17.583 --> 01:19.291
She thinks they're
educational toys.

01:19.291 --> 01:21.458
And you are not gonna be
the one to tell her about it.

01:21.458 --> 01:24.291
Don't worry.
I won't say anything.

01:24.291 --> 01:27.333
Look, we don't have to worry
about Kelbo's gift this year,

01:27.333 --> 01:28.833
because he's not
coming to dinner.

01:28.833 --> 01:30.458
Uncle Kelbo's not
coming to dinner?

01:30.458 --> 01:32.208
That's my gift to Mom.
I call it.

02:29.583 --> 02:33.458
Hey, Mom, here's a
little pre-birthday present.

02:33.458 --> 02:35.583
Uncle Kelbo's not coming
to your birthday dinner.

02:35.583 --> 02:38.250
Pretty good, huh? It's just
gonna be the six of us.

02:40.083 --> 02:43.500
That's great, honey. It'll be
just like every other dinner,
right?

02:43.500 --> 02:45.166
Do I get to cook it, too?

02:45.166 --> 02:48.333
No, it's your birthday.
It should be special.

02:48.333 --> 02:50.333
Why don't we invite over
all of your cousins?

02:50.333 --> 02:52.250
They live so close
but we never get to see them.

02:52.250 --> 02:55.583
No, no, no. No one from my
side of the family is visiting.

02:55.583 --> 02:57.708
Can we at least
invite Uncle Ernesto?

02:57.708 --> 03:02.000
Yeah, come on. He always has
awesome stories about his
travels all over the world.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.958
His stories aren't that great.

03:03.958 --> 03:06.000
I've got stories
from my travels.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.708
Remember the time I almost
hit the rat on the Brooklyn
Bridge?

03:08.708 --> 03:11.416
I was like... whoa!

03:15.208 --> 03:18.583
I'll never forget that time
Uncle Ernesto took me to that
Mets game.

03:18.583 --> 03:21.375
He caught a foul ball
and gave it to me.

03:21.375 --> 03:22.875
That was like, ten years ago.

03:22.875 --> 03:25.458
How about you get another story
about some grown-up that likes
you.

03:27.208 --> 03:29.083
Ten years, Theresa.

03:29.083 --> 03:32.750
I think they're old enough
to understand now.

03:32.750 --> 03:35.625
Yeah, Mom, come on.
What is it?

03:35.625 --> 03:37.583
Are you embarrassed of us?

03:40.458 --> 03:43.291
If anyone needs me, I'll be
upstairs spearing things.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.958
No, honey, I've numbed out
"embarrassed" long, long ago.

03:50.416 --> 03:52.000
Then what is it, Mom?
We used to have so much fun

03:52.000 --> 03:53.125
with Uncle Ernesto.

03:53.125 --> 03:55.708
Yeah. That was before
your powers came in.

03:55.708 --> 03:57.875
Remember the next time
he took you to a Mets game?

03:57.875 --> 04:00.875
You guys used magic to make
every foul ball come straight
to you.

04:00.875 --> 04:04.708
- Oh, yeah.
- After that, I can't risk
him finding out about magic.

04:04.708 --> 04:08.250
Well... So, what, you're
just gonna ignore your brother
forever?

04:08.250 --> 04:09.958
That actually sounds
like a good idea.

04:11.291 --> 04:14.583
I've thought about having
Ernesto over so many times

04:14.583 --> 04:18.416
but you guys are way too
careless with wizardry.

04:18.416 --> 04:21.708
Well... OK, what about this:

04:21.708 --> 04:24.000
What if we promised that
if Uncle Ernesto came over,

04:24.000 --> 04:26.250
it would be
a magic-free evening?

04:26.250 --> 04:28.500
I would love
to have Ernesto over,

04:28.500 --> 04:32.083
but you guys can't go ten
minutes without using magic.

04:32.083 --> 04:35.083
Mom, I've been holding
back using magic all day.

04:35.083 --> 04:39.291
You don't think I want to
turn Justin's ugly shirt
into something uglier?

04:39.291 --> 04:42.291
You don't think I want to
put a zipper on Alex's face?

04:43.958 --> 04:46.000
- If you promise...
- We promise.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
- Promise.
- Promise, promise.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.458
Then I guess we can
have Ernesto over.

04:50.458 --> 04:53.166
Yay for family.

05:00.875 --> 05:04.875
Oh, Harper, you don't have to go
to such extremes for my birthday
cake.

05:04.875 --> 05:07.583
I'd be just as happy
with a candle in a cupcake.

05:07.583 --> 05:10.083
Well, let her
make the cake, honey.

05:10.083 --> 05:11.708
Ooh, that would be good.

05:11.708 --> 05:14.083
Harper, can you
make a honey cake?

05:14.083 --> 05:15.583
I can put in whatever you want.

05:15.583 --> 05:18.583
Making a birthday cake from
scratch is a Finkle family
tradition.

05:19.708 --> 05:22.083
All right.
Wands are in the Lair.

05:22.083 --> 05:24.875
The well is gone.
We are in a magic-free zone.

05:24.875 --> 05:27.333
- Happy birthday, Mom.
- Thank you, mija.

05:27.333 --> 05:30.416
This is gonna be
the best birthday ever.

05:30.416 --> 05:32.208
Oh, I hope I didn't
just jinx it.

05:32.208 --> 05:35.083
Oh, that's Uncle Ernesto.

05:35.083 --> 05:38.250
OK, whatever you guys do,
do not use magic.

05:38.250 --> 05:40.583
Yes, Justin, why don't
you say it louder?

05:42.583 --> 05:45.083
- Hey!
- Hey!

05:45.083 --> 05:48.458
How you doing? Nice to see you.
What's up, man?

05:48.458 --> 05:51.708
- Hey, Theresa!
- Ernesto!

05:51.708 --> 05:55.166
- Oh, you look great.
- I know!

05:56.333 --> 05:58.416
And you still look
like you're 27 years old.

05:58.416 --> 06:00.583
I know!

06:00.583 --> 06:02.083
You haven't changed, have you?

06:02.083 --> 06:05.208
Has she told you how wildly
popular she was in high school?

06:05.208 --> 06:08.000
Today? Not yet.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.625
Well, I was wildly popular, too.

06:10.625 --> 06:13.625
But am I the only one here?
Where's the rest of the family?

06:13.625 --> 06:18.583
Oh, well, I got so excited
when I invited you and you
said you'd come

06:18.583 --> 06:20.958
that I forgot to
invite anybody else.

06:20.958 --> 06:24.333
- Jerry?
- Um...

06:24.333 --> 06:26.958
Long time, no see, Ernesto.
How've you been?

06:26.958 --> 06:28.750
Oh, terrific.
I've been terrific, actually.

06:28.750 --> 06:30.958
I just came back from
a trip down to Mexico,

06:30.958 --> 06:36.583
and while I was there,
I helped rescue
the President of Mexico's cat.

06:37.875 --> 06:41.583
So... they gave me
the key to the country!

06:42.208 --> 06:43.708
Wow!

06:43.708 --> 06:45.708
Now we can get into Mexico,

06:45.708 --> 06:47.583
even after it's closed,
and on the weekends.

06:48.750 --> 06:51.625
All right. I was
just kidding about the key.

06:51.625 --> 06:55.708
But I did save the President
of Mexico's cat, and in return,
he gave me a job.

06:55.708 --> 06:58.458
Head of security.
For the cat.

07:00.583 --> 07:03.625
Oh, so that would
make you a catsitter?

07:05.166 --> 07:07.333
Alex...

07:07.333 --> 07:08.708
You look wonderful.

07:08.708 --> 07:10.458
You look like
a grown up young lady.

07:10.458 --> 07:12.875
Aw. See, everybody?

07:12.875 --> 07:16.208
It's possible to say
that without being sarcastic.

07:17.500 --> 07:18.708
And, Justin! Look at you, man.

07:18.708 --> 07:20.750
Pretty soon, you're gonna
be taller than me.

07:23.708 --> 07:27.083
I already am taller
than you, Uncle Ernesto.

07:27.083 --> 07:30.958
Well, if your mother's 27,
then I'm taller than you.

07:32.208 --> 07:33.958
Now, I know it's
your mother's birthday

07:33.958 --> 07:36.625
but I still got you guys
a little something-something.

07:36.625 --> 07:38.958
Aw, thank you.
That's so sweet of you.

07:38.958 --> 07:41.875
Hi. Hello. I'm Harper.

07:41.875 --> 07:45.583
I live with the Russos.
Where's my little
something-something?

07:45.583 --> 07:47.958
Oh... Harper, nice to meet you.

07:47.958 --> 07:52.708
I'm sorry. If I knew you were
here, I would've brought you
chocolate fudge or something.

07:52.708 --> 07:54.875
Oh. No worries.

07:54.875 --> 07:59.250
Being forgotten is like an old,
comfortable pair of shoes.

07:59.250 --> 08:02.583
Well, how about a giant
novelty key that I bought
in Times Square?

08:02.583 --> 08:06.125
Ah! This is fine for now,
but now that you know I exist,

08:06.125 --> 08:08.250
I expect something
better next time.

08:09.500 --> 08:12.875
OK. Why don't we all
just sit down, relax,

08:12.875 --> 08:15.375
and Alex and Justin
can open up their gifts.

08:15.375 --> 08:17.416
You guys are
gonna love it.

08:17.416 --> 08:20.708
It is a classic Latin American
game called Balero.

08:20.708 --> 08:24.833
Ah. And if I'm not mistaken,
Balero is Spanish

08:24.833 --> 08:28.083
for "something really
cool and expensive."

08:30.958 --> 08:33.458
And I'm mistaken.

08:33.458 --> 08:38.083
And for Theresa, I got our home
movies transferred to a DVD...

08:38.083 --> 08:43.166
...and our most precious
memories in a scrapbook.

08:43.166 --> 08:47.375
Oh, Ernesto. It's wonderful.

08:48.291 --> 08:49.625
Hey...

08:49.625 --> 08:51.500
- Uncle Ernesto!
- Max.

08:51.500 --> 08:52.958
Hey, I got you a gift.

08:52.958 --> 08:55.083
It's those shoes you wanted
when you were little,

08:55.083 --> 08:56.458
the ones with the
springs on the bottom.

08:56.458 --> 08:59.708
Remember how you said you
wanted to jump to the moon?

09:00.458 --> 09:01.958
Wow, thank you.

09:01.958 --> 09:04.291
But, I don't really need those.
I've been to Mars.

09:04.291 --> 09:06.125
- To Mars?
- Uh...

09:06.125 --> 09:10.458
What he means to say is he's
been to a Mars-themed restaurant
in mid-town.

09:10.458 --> 09:15.583
Yep. It's called T.J.I.,
you know... Mars.

09:15.583 --> 09:17.833
Yeah, you're right. I'm sorry.
I was just distracted by
this gift

09:17.833 --> 09:19.458
that came for Mom
from Uncle Kelbo.

09:19.458 --> 09:24.291
- Open it, Mom.
- Max, why don't you
get that out of here?

09:24.291 --> 09:26.125
All right. I'll take it
down to the Lair.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.750
Um... Lair?

09:29.750 --> 09:31.375
Uh... He means fort.
We have a fort.

09:31.375 --> 09:32.708
We built a fort.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.375
Can someone go down and make
sure that Kelbo's gift

09:36.375 --> 09:38.875
- gets into the fort?
- I'll go.

09:38.875 --> 09:41.291
- I meant you.
- Yeah, you got it.

09:41.291 --> 09:44.083
I'm just gonna go to the fort.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.958
A fort sounds like fun, man.

09:47.958 --> 09:49.750
I built a fort
once in the woods.

09:49.750 --> 09:52.750
Yeah, it was so amazing that
the park rangers turned it into
a gift shop

09:52.750 --> 09:55.000
where they sold mini
versions of that fort.

09:56.500 --> 10:01.250
Well, I've slept outside
on our terrace.

10:01.250 --> 10:03.458
In the rain.

10:03.458 --> 10:04.875
Why would you do that?

10:06.583 --> 10:10.750
In case I ran into someone
with a story like that,
so I could top it.

10:10.750 --> 10:12.416
Topped.

10:14.291 --> 10:16.333
All right, well,
let's go check out this fort.

10:16.333 --> 10:19.750
No, no! We can't,
because we have to...

10:19.750 --> 10:22.291
...move the furniture
like Theresa's always wanted.

10:22.291 --> 10:25.750
- Happy birthday, honey.
- Oh, thank you! It's what I've
always wanted.

10:25.750 --> 10:27.458
Uh... Ernesto,
could you give me a hand?

10:27.458 --> 10:29.875
Yes, I can give you a hand.

10:29.875 --> 10:32.000
Yeah, Jerry!
Go, do it!

10:32.000 --> 10:33.708
You can move it!

10:35.291 --> 10:36.833
Just kidding.
Topped.

10:44.583 --> 10:49.583
Max! Max, we are trying to give
Mom a magic-free birthday.

10:49.583 --> 10:52.291
Don't bring any of Uncle Kelbo's
crazy magic gift upstairs.

10:52.291 --> 10:54.750
Fine, I'll put it on
the shelf with the others.

10:56.291 --> 10:57.708
Others?

10:59.458 --> 11:03.250
Did you just say that shelf
is full of crazy magic gifts?

11:03.250 --> 11:07.083
Um, no. You said crazy magic
gifts. I just said shelf.

11:07.083 --> 11:10.458
I can't believe it.
I never touched those!

11:10.458 --> 11:13.375
Dad told me those
were educational toys. Max...

11:13.375 --> 11:16.291
You knew about this and you
didn't open up the gifts?

11:16.291 --> 11:18.750
When I first heard about
the shelf I was too short
to reach it,

11:18.750 --> 11:20.583
so, naturally,
I forgot about it.

11:20.583 --> 11:22.875
I'm trying to forget
about stuff I can't reach.

11:22.875 --> 11:25.750
Leaves more room up here
for important stuff.

11:25.750 --> 11:30.208
Oh, look. "Party in a Box."

11:30.208 --> 11:33.166
Open the lid and turn any room
into an instant party.

11:33.166 --> 11:36.250
Well, I am dying to do that.

11:36.250 --> 11:37.416
What are you guys doing?

11:39.000 --> 11:40.708
- You showed her the shelf,
didn't ya?
- Yup.

11:42.375 --> 11:44.708
Forget about this, Alex.
We're supposed to be upstairs

11:44.708 --> 11:46.875
having nothing to do with magic
and that's where we're going.

11:46.875 --> 11:50.458
Yeah, but there's a whole
shelf of crazy magic gifts
nobody ever told me about.

11:50.458 --> 11:52.375
And, ooh...

11:52.375 --> 11:54.625
Look at this one.

11:54.625 --> 11:58.875
This one sounds like
it's a time-traveling
pocket watch.

11:58.875 --> 12:02.291
- You know you want it.
- No, I do not want it.

12:02.291 --> 12:04.333
Why would I want that? We're not
supposed to be using magic

12:04.333 --> 12:08.166
- so let's go. Come on!
- Tick-tock. Tick-tock.

12:08.166 --> 12:11.708
Alex, that's not even how you do
it. Give it here. I'll show you.

12:13.208 --> 12:18.250
Oooh. It's a magic
Swiss Shoulder Bag.

12:18.250 --> 12:20.083
It has everything in it
you need to survive.

12:20.083 --> 12:21.875
Just like a wizard
Swiss Army Knife.

12:21.875 --> 12:24.375
Including...
a mini-magic wand.

12:28.125 --> 12:29.458
It's just a toothpick.

12:32.625 --> 12:35.875
- All right. We're opening
presents. Love it!
- Yes!

12:35.875 --> 12:37.416
Here we go.

12:39.250 --> 12:40.875
- Perfect.
- What?

12:40.875 --> 12:43.125
It will complete my collection.

12:44.500 --> 12:49.333
- Of what?
- Of things I have no idea what
they are.

12:49.333 --> 12:52.000
Max, it's a toy chicken
in a box.

13:04.083 --> 13:07.000
"Fu-chicken." A chicken
that tells the future.

13:07.000 --> 13:11.958
Ask it a question about the
future and when it lays its
egg, the answer is inside.

13:11.958 --> 13:14.583
Really? I'm gonna ask it if
I'll ever be able to pull off
skinny jeans.

13:14.583 --> 13:16.583
Look, I'll answer that. No.

13:16.583 --> 13:22.000
OK... Which one of us will
win the wizard competition?

13:22.000 --> 13:25.083
I need to know if all this
"studying" is paying off.

13:27.875 --> 13:31.708
Nicely done. Now we have to wait
for it to lay the answer egg.

13:31.708 --> 13:34.833
You kidding me?
I don't have that kind of time.

13:34.833 --> 13:38.875
Maybe I can squeeze it
out of him.

13:38.875 --> 13:41.083
Here, wait! Wait!

13:41.083 --> 13:43.166
Get the chicken!

13:44.375 --> 13:46.708
Look! Look at this.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.958
Uh... huh.

13:51.958 --> 13:54.583
Please note:
Scaring the Fu-chicken

13:54.583 --> 13:58.083
will cause it to lay
various breakfasts,
delaying the answer egg.

13:58.083 --> 14:02.583
We need to go get that chicken
before it lays magic waffles
in front of Uncle Ernesto.

14:04.375 --> 14:06.000
How did it lay the plate?

14:17.458 --> 14:20.833
Whoa! Did the magic chicken
move all the furniture around?

14:20.833 --> 14:22.625
- What?
- Uh...

14:22.625 --> 14:25.458
Max calls Dad
"Magic Chicken."

14:25.458 --> 14:31.500
Oh, uh, right. And I call him
"Boy Who Should Stop Talking."

14:32.583 --> 14:34.083
What's going on?

14:34.083 --> 14:35.958
There's gifts from Uncle Kelbo
we weren't supposed to open,

14:35.958 --> 14:38.291
but we did, Mom hates magic,
there's a magic chicken,

14:38.291 --> 14:41.000
if you see waffles,
don't ask where they came from,
just enjoy them.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.166
Wait, people are eating
waffles? I made cake.

14:46.750 --> 14:49.708
Aw. Look at you guys, picking up
right where you left off.

14:49.708 --> 14:54.458
- Happy birthday, Mom.
- It was all Alex's idea,
you know, inviting you.

14:54.458 --> 14:56.875
Uh... Now, now. Come on.

14:56.875 --> 15:00.375
I'm not one to take
credit... or blame.

15:00.375 --> 15:03.583
Let's just say that this
was everybody's idea, OK?

15:03.583 --> 15:05.375
You'll want to remember
that for later.

15:06.833 --> 15:09.625
Hey! Magic chicken!

15:09.625 --> 15:11.583
Hey, Jerry,
your son's calling you.

15:11.583 --> 15:14.375
What? Oh, right.

15:14.375 --> 15:16.708
We do love our
nicknames in this family.

15:16.708 --> 15:19.375
Don't we,
"What Should We Do Now?"

15:19.375 --> 15:21.875
Yep. That's my nickname.

15:21.875 --> 15:25.625
My nickname is: "I'm Sorry, Mom,
and Remember I'm the Good One,
Usually the Victim."

15:26.708 --> 15:28.333
That's kind of long,
isn't it?

15:30.125 --> 15:33.750
Hey, let's watch go watch some
home movies in our new living
area,

15:33.750 --> 15:36.250
or as I believe they're
called now the "great room."

15:36.250 --> 15:39.416
Oh, no. No movies. New plan.

15:39.416 --> 15:43.375
We, we act them out. I'll be
Mom, Justin, you're Ernesto.

15:43.375 --> 15:45.708
And you are Grandma Maggie.
Go!

15:47.958 --> 15:51.458
OK... OK.
Um, I'm Grandma Maggie.

15:51.458 --> 15:54.333
Here's the story of my
bicycle tour across America.

15:57.333 --> 15:59.458
Why is there a chicken
on the terrace?

15:59.458 --> 16:02.416
Well, off the record,
the chicken is gonna lay an egg

16:02.416 --> 16:04.875
that's gonna tell us who's gonna
win the wizard competition.

16:04.875 --> 16:07.125
Now, on the record,
I don't... what chicken?

16:08.083 --> 16:09.375
OK, look...

16:09.375 --> 16:11.333
...someone found
a chicken on the street

16:11.333 --> 16:12.750
and then brought it
into the house.

16:12.750 --> 16:15.875
We can explain that. And lots of
people raise their own chickens

16:15.875 --> 16:17.458
so they don't have
to pay for eggs, or...

16:19.416 --> 16:21.125
...or plates of waffles
with fruit salad?!

16:21.125 --> 16:23.708
- We can't explain that!
- OK, I'll get rid of it.

16:23.708 --> 16:26.583
Yes, you will. And, wrap up
the waffles in some foil.

16:26.583 --> 16:28.500
You can just toss
the fruit salad.

16:28.500 --> 16:33.500
- Uh...
- And then I forgot which state
was downhill.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.875
OK, "Boy Who Should
Stop Talking,"

16:36.875 --> 16:39.708
go wash up on the terrace
with "What Should We Do Now"

16:39.708 --> 16:41.833
and "I'm Usually The Victim."

16:43.333 --> 16:45.416
Grab the chicken. Get it!

16:45.416 --> 16:47.125
Get it, Alex!

16:48.416 --> 16:50.208
He still hasn't laid
the answer egg.

16:50.208 --> 16:53.625
Must be waiting right there
in his chicken butt.

16:53.625 --> 16:56.708
OK, I have an idea. Max, why
don't you distract the chicken,

16:56.708 --> 17:00.583
- and I'll catch it in this box.
- But that's Dad's good box.

17:00.583 --> 17:03.291
That's the box he was gonna
use to store his favorite
paper bags.

17:03.291 --> 17:06.958
Justin, we have to do
something to save Mom's
"no-magic birthday."

17:06.958 --> 17:09.125
All right, Max.
Distract the chicken.

17:09.125 --> 17:10.750
Do your "distract the chicken"
dance.

17:10.750 --> 17:12.583
Thought you'd never ask.

17:21.833 --> 17:23.458
- Alex!
- Oh, right. Sorry.

17:23.458 --> 17:25.875
That was so good
you distracted me.

17:27.458 --> 17:29.333
OK, I got it. I got it.

17:29.333 --> 17:31.416
Put it in.

17:31.416 --> 17:33.958
Magic chicken problem solved.

17:33.958 --> 17:37.291
Now, let's get in there and
act like nothing's going on.

17:37.291 --> 17:39.166
Or...

17:39.166 --> 17:43.458
Or Max could stay here and watch
it and wait for it to lay the
answer egg.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
All right. Fine.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.208
All right.

17:54.583 --> 17:55.875
Boo!

17:58.583 --> 18:02.875
Ah, my favorite.
Body-temperature oatmeal.

18:04.375 --> 18:09.000
Oh, look at us.
We are so cute!

18:10.625 --> 18:12.500
Look how much fun
they're having.

18:12.500 --> 18:14.250
Aren't you glad we
didn't ruin it for them?

18:14.250 --> 18:15.833
Yep, got it all under control.

18:15.833 --> 18:18.291
It's not like your bag
is glowing or anything.

18:18.291 --> 18:20.208
I know. My bag is glowing.

18:21.375 --> 18:25.458
- OK! I'm here to help!
- Uh...

18:25.458 --> 18:29.833
Um... where did he come from?

18:29.833 --> 18:33.250
- Uh, this is...
- Our superintendant.

18:33.250 --> 18:36.875
He has keys to all the
apartments and lets himself
in whenever he wants.

18:36.875 --> 18:40.416
Yes, Cliff,
thank you for coming.

18:40.416 --> 18:43.208
The toilet is backed up.
Let me show you where it is.

18:44.375 --> 18:45.875
Hey!

18:45.875 --> 18:48.458
Get back here, magic chicken.

18:48.458 --> 18:51.416
I got him! I...

18:51.416 --> 18:54.875
Chicken? I hate chickens.
Get it away from me.

18:58.250 --> 19:00.208
Hello, Cliff.

19:00.208 --> 19:03.458
Yeah, I don't think this
is the kind of birthday party

19:03.458 --> 19:05.083
your mom was
looking for, Alex.

19:05.083 --> 19:08.000
Relax. At least I didn't
open the "Party in a Box."

19:09.250 --> 19:11.166
I...

19:14.750 --> 19:17.083
All right. What's going on?

19:17.083 --> 19:18.416
Where did all that
come from?

19:18.416 --> 19:22.583
It's a surprise
birthday party for me!

19:22.583 --> 19:24.000
Yes, that's exactly what it is.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.500
Everybody, surprise! Surprise.

19:26.500 --> 19:28.166
Surprise!

19:28.166 --> 19:30.625
They are always surprising me.

19:30.625 --> 19:34.166
Everywhere I look,
there's always a surprise.

19:34.166 --> 19:38.000
Alex, why don't you come outside
onto the terrace with me,

19:38.000 --> 19:39.875
so I can thank you
for the surprise.

19:39.875 --> 19:44.250
Oh, no thank you, Mom. Whatever
you need to say, you can say
in front of the witnesses.

19:52.750 --> 19:54.458
What is going on in there?

19:54.458 --> 19:57.125
If you would have told me that
my birthday reunion with Ernesto

19:57.125 --> 20:00.958
was gonna be a three-ring,
dance party, chicken-squawking,
elf circus,

20:00.958 --> 20:03.875
I would've said,
"Uh... no thanks."

20:04.583 --> 20:05.583
I'm sorry, Mom.

20:05.583 --> 20:07.083
I didn't mean for
all this to happen.

20:07.083 --> 20:10.708
You never mean it, do you, Alex?
Yet it always happens.

20:10.708 --> 20:13.416
I should have known better
than to trust you.

20:15.291 --> 20:18.458
Mom, I know how much
you've sacrificed for us.

20:20.125 --> 20:22.833
I just wanted you to give you
a special birthday with
Uncle Ernesto.

20:22.833 --> 20:25.875
Then Uncle Kelbo sent a
magic chicken that tells
the future.

20:25.875 --> 20:27.833
It was too tempting.

20:27.833 --> 20:31.166
Yeah. Magic is always too
tempting for you, isn't it?

20:31.166 --> 20:36.208
And I had to lie to my own
brother about what's going on.

20:36.208 --> 20:40.125
Which is exactly what
I was trying to avoid
in the first place.

20:41.458 --> 20:43.625
I'm sorry, Mom!

20:46.083 --> 20:49.458
What... What happened
to the party?

20:49.458 --> 20:51.875
I had to use the
police siren chirp spell.

20:51.875 --> 20:54.750
Everyone scattered.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.250
Where's Ernesto?

20:57.250 --> 20:59.000
He didn't see you
use magic, did he?

20:59.000 --> 21:02.875
No, no. He left
during the chaos.

21:02.875 --> 21:06.875
But, he did have that look on
his face that most people get

21:06.875 --> 21:09.166
when they're with us
more than an hour.

21:09.166 --> 21:15.083
So it's official. He hates us,
or he's confused by us, or both.

21:15.083 --> 21:18.416
Got it! The magic chicken
finally laid the answer egg.

21:18.416 --> 21:21.375
Now we can find out who wins
the wizard competition.

21:21.375 --> 21:22.708
I'll take that.

21:24.375 --> 21:25.458
Alex...?

21:28.875 --> 21:30.458
What'd you do that for?!

21:30.458 --> 21:32.333
It's my lame attempt
at showing Mom

21:32.333 --> 21:34.375
that we can make
sacrifices for her, too.

21:34.375 --> 21:37.083
Well, now we're never
gonna find out who wins
the wizard competition.

21:37.083 --> 21:40.708
How about right after we
have the wizard competition?

21:40.708 --> 21:42.333
I trust the chicken more.

21:43.875 --> 21:45.416
I'm sorry, Mom.

21:46.583 --> 21:49.000
I appreciate the
sacrifice, Alex.

21:49.000 --> 21:52.375
Whoo! Cake's ready! Yay!

21:52.375 --> 21:55.125
Harper, things are
still tense.

21:56.250 --> 21:58.458
Thank you for making
the cake, Harper.

21:58.458 --> 22:01.875
It's beautiful
and it looks delicious.

22:01.875 --> 22:04.875
Oh, no... we don't eat it.

22:04.875 --> 22:07.208
The Finkle tradition is that
you make a cake from scratch,

22:07.208 --> 22:10.500
then use rolling pins to smash
it, together as a family.

22:10.500 --> 22:13.583
It's the one time a year
we let out our frustrations.

22:13.583 --> 22:16.000
And I think the cake
is ready just in time.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.458
No one hit me in the face,
I'm goin' in.

22:18.458 --> 22:21.416
Let the cake-smushing begin
on the count of three. One...

22:22.333 --> 22:24.833
All right. Everybody smush!

22:26.083 --> 22:28.166
Whoo!

22:28.166 --> 22:30.291
- Yeah!
- Smush!

22:30.291 --> 22:31.750
That's great!

22:38.333 --> 22:41.000
Ernesto? You came back!

22:41.000 --> 22:44.208
Of course, I came back.
It turned into a party,
so I brought...

22:46.500 --> 22:50.500
Francisco, Angel, Rosa,
and the twins!

22:50.500 --> 22:53.083
Oh, I can't
believe you're here!

22:56.125 --> 22:57.875
Hey, what happened to the party?

22:57.875 --> 23:00.000
You're making me look bad
in front of my family.

23:00.000 --> 23:04.291
Uh... Well, I don't
want to lie to you.

23:04.291 --> 23:06.291
The police showed up
and everybody scattered.

23:06.291 --> 23:08.000
I...

23:08.000 --> 23:10.083
I've thrown great
parties like that before.

23:10.083 --> 23:12.000
It happens when
you're wildly popular.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.583
- Well...
- You've got great timing.

23:14.583 --> 23:17.208
We were just about to sing happy
birthday to the smushed cake.

23:22.375 --> 23:26.083
OK, great, but let's do it
like our family does it.

23:26.083 --> 23:27.708
Yeah.

23:27.708 --> 23:29.000
All right, gather 'round.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.458
And three, two, one...

23:47.000 --> 23:50.000
- Did you make a wish?
- I don't have to.

23:50.000 --> 23:51.875
It's already come true.

23:58.416 --> 23:59.708
Hey, guys!

24:01.500 --> 24:03.625
- Uncle Ernesto!
- I can explain.

24:03.625 --> 24:06.958
No need to explain.
I know what this room is.

24:08.708 --> 24:10.125
It's Max's fort.

24:11.958 --> 24:13.458
I always suspected it.

24:13.458 --> 24:15.833
All right, everybody out.
You heard Uncle Ernesto.

24:15.833 --> 24:16.875
It's my fort.

24:18.333 --> 24:19.708
Max, this is an amazing fort.

24:19.708 --> 24:21.166
Almost as amazing as mine.

24:21.166 --> 24:23.291
But not so amazing that they
would build a gift shop

24:23.291 --> 24:26.625
where they would sell miniature
versions of it.

24:28.375 --> 24:31.458
I'd love to use magic to make
this a real-sized fort.

24:31.458 --> 24:33.291
Max!

24:33.291 --> 24:36.416
- I bet you would, Max.
- Yeah.

24:36.416 --> 24:37.625
That's how amazing this fort is.

24:37.625 --> 24:40.583
When people see it,
they wish they had magic.
