WEBVTT

00:04.462 --> 00:05.672
Thank you.

00:06.798 --> 00:07.841
(dreamy music)

00:21.021 --> 00:22.522
-Are you...
-(scoffs)

00:23.440 --> 00:24.357
(scoffs)

00:25.316 --> 00:28.486
What are you doing here?
This place isn't for anybody...

00:30.697 --> 00:33.491
EUNKANG: <i>What? Is he a student here?</i>

00:34.451 --> 00:35.452
<i>No, wait.</i>

00:36.119 --> 00:38.580
<i>If he's Minyong's friend, he must be...</i>

00:38.788 --> 00:39.622
(gasps)

00:40.206 --> 00:43.793
Excuse me, but are you my senior?

00:46.713 --> 00:48.048
<i>Damn it.</i>

00:48.548 --> 00:50.383
Wow. Hello.

00:50.759 --> 00:51.968
How have you been?

00:52.260 --> 00:55.513
It's funny we meet again here.
(laughs)

00:55.597 --> 00:56.890
What a small world.

00:56.973 --> 00:58.975
I know. I'm surprised too.

00:59.184 --> 01:02.062
Did you get home safely that night?

01:02.270 --> 01:03.396
In one piece?

01:03.772 --> 01:07.609
Well, thanks to you,
my sister and I got home safe.

01:07.692 --> 01:08.526
(Eunkang laughs awkwardly)

01:08.818 --> 01:11.488
My. I just can't thank you enough.

01:13.573 --> 01:16.785
<i>I knew it. He's still holding a grudge.</i>

01:18.078 --> 01:21.081
Was the unpleasant issue resolved?

01:21.414 --> 01:24.793
We sent him the bag. Have you heard
anything about it, by any chance?

01:24.876 --> 01:26.044
-So what?
-Pardon?

01:26.169 --> 01:29.714
Did you think sending it back
would make him feel better?

01:29.923 --> 01:30.840
(Seunghyun breathes heavily)

01:30.924 --> 01:32.926
You don't get the point, do you?

01:35.178 --> 01:37.013
The reason he mentioned the bag

01:37.430 --> 01:41.434
wasn't because he wanted it back,
but because he wanted her apology.

01:41.559 --> 01:43.978
He wanted her to apologize
for playing with his heart.

01:44.062 --> 01:47.023
I'm sorry, what? Play with his heart?

01:47.107 --> 01:49.651
My sister said she actually mourned
for her relationship

01:49.734 --> 01:53.363
with your friend after the breakup,
though it was for a short while.

01:53.446 --> 01:55.240
She started dating the other guy
after that.

01:55.323 --> 01:57.242
I'm saying she wasn't two-timing him.

01:57.325 --> 01:58.701
I think we should make that clear...

01:58.785 --> 02:00.286
(snickers, scoffs)

02:01.454 --> 02:02.956
EUNKANG: <i>What was that? That was so rude.</i>

02:05.166 --> 02:06.251
SUNYU: Ms. Ko Eunkang.

02:06.501 --> 02:07.961
Yes. I'll be right there, ma'am.

02:08.503 --> 02:10.672
Excuse me,
but can we talk about this later?

02:10.755 --> 02:12.340
I'm afraid I have to go now. Bye then.

02:12.799 --> 02:13.800
Wait...

02:16.261 --> 02:17.095
(scoffs)

02:18.680 --> 02:19.514
(alarm clock ringing)

02:19.973 --> 02:20.849
ROOKIE COPS

02:21.975 --> 02:23.268
(theme music)

03:02.932 --> 03:05.268
This is Ko Eunkang, your new roommate.

03:06.978 --> 03:08.396
SUNYU: You should introduce yourselves.

03:09.063 --> 03:12.984
Tell her about the basic rules
in the dorm after lunch.

03:13.067 --> 03:14.485
ALL: Yes, ma'am!

03:24.037 --> 03:24.871
Hi.

03:25.914 --> 03:26.831
(crockery clanging)

03:27.290 --> 03:29.000
EUNKANG: I was so bummed out.

03:29.125 --> 03:31.211
Then I was told
I was given an extra place.

03:31.294 --> 03:33.087
Gosh. It was crazy.
(chuckling)

03:33.546 --> 03:35.798
Man. I wish I got an extra place.

03:35.882 --> 03:39.344
-It sounds so exciting.
-Not for me. I hate the jitters.

03:40.178 --> 03:42.138
So you came here
right after the call yesterday?

03:42.222 --> 03:44.307
Yes, I couldn't sleep a wink.

03:44.390 --> 03:46.184
But I'm not even tired.

03:46.267 --> 03:48.895
Now that I'm here,
I can tell I belong here.

03:49.395 --> 03:50.772
-Hmm.
-Mm-hmm.

03:51.147 --> 03:55.944
Good. Enjoy it while it lasts
before you bawl your eyes out.

03:56.319 --> 03:58.780
I hope this excitement lasts long.

03:59.197 --> 04:00.156
Good luck.

04:02.659 --> 04:05.495
-I'm done.
-Oh, okay.

04:06.079 --> 04:07.830
All right. See you later.

04:09.666 --> 04:11.125
(indistinct chattering)

04:12.043 --> 04:13.419
(crockery clanging)

04:14.337 --> 04:16.339
ARI: <i>That's not how you socialize.</i>

04:16.422 --> 04:18.925
<i>When you're in a big group,
you need to be kind and cooperative.</i>

04:19.008 --> 04:19.926
<i>But she's neither.</i>

04:20.218 --> 04:23.221
She's such a wet blanket.
She spoils the mood all the time.

04:23.471 --> 04:24.764
She was like that even before you came.

04:25.431 --> 04:26.432
Maybe she's busy.

04:26.516 --> 04:28.977
No, she's not.
We all have the same schedule.

04:29.477 --> 04:32.438
I can't wait for this training to end.
Because then I'll have new roommates.

04:32.522 --> 04:34.565
Wait. They are going to change
our roommates, right?

04:34.649 --> 04:37.694
You never know.
But there are only 12 girls.

04:37.777 --> 04:39.821
There's a good chance
she'll be your roomie again.

04:39.904 --> 04:42.699
No way! I'm going to
get her switched no matter what.

04:42.991 --> 04:43.950
(rapid retreating footsteps)

04:44.701 --> 04:45.535
(scoffs)

04:47.537 --> 04:48.788
I'm Bang Heesun.

04:49.080 --> 04:53.084
I majored in psychology
and I'm teaching criminal psychology.

04:54.002 --> 04:56.421
As you're not
official students of KNPU yet

04:56.504 --> 04:58.673
and this is an orientation,

04:58.756 --> 05:03.303
today, I'm going to talk about the school
and what you're going to be learning here.

05:06.222 --> 05:07.849
(whispers)
She certainly has charisma.

05:08.975 --> 05:10.059
KOREAN NATIONAL POLICE UNIVERSITY
INTRODUCTION

05:10.143 --> 05:12.228
Does anyone know what this is?

05:15.064 --> 05:17.275
It's the emblem of our school.

05:17.358 --> 05:18.192
HEESUN: Good.

05:18.359 --> 05:20.820
The bird on the hibiscus is a sea eagle.

05:21.112 --> 05:23.281
What do you think it means?

05:26.409 --> 05:27.785
The sea eagle symbolizes the police

05:27.869 --> 05:30.079
and the hibiscus symbolizes
the country and its people.

05:30.163 --> 05:32.415
It's an image of the police
protecting the people

05:32.498 --> 05:34.584
and soaring to the sky,
with the hibiscus in its claws.

05:34.667 --> 05:35.835
(class murmuring)

05:36.336 --> 05:38.463
Look at her, so desperate for attention.

05:38.546 --> 05:39.547
Hey.

05:49.182 --> 05:50.016
(clears throat)

05:50.933 --> 05:51.768
(door closes)

05:54.062 --> 05:55.980
(whispers)
Who is he?

05:57.815 --> 05:59.025
(scribbling)

06:00.860 --> 06:02.570
THE CHIEF TRAINER
HELL

06:02.653 --> 06:05.531
For the next four years,
you'll be studying

06:05.615 --> 06:09.327
specialized theories
and how to put them into practical use.

06:09.952 --> 06:11.913
HEESUN: Including general studies
like humanities, sociology,

06:11.996 --> 06:13.039
and natural science,

06:13.122 --> 06:16.334
starting the second year,
you'll be learning about police science,

06:16.417 --> 06:17.710
which includes subjects like law

06:17.794 --> 06:20.004
and public administration,
depending on your major.

06:22.048 --> 06:24.634
Your goal is to learn
the current security policies

06:24.717 --> 06:28.846
and eventually,
to develop creative policies.

06:29.806 --> 06:30.681
All right.

06:31.349 --> 06:32.809
That's it for today.

06:33.559 --> 06:35.395
In the next class, I will tell you

06:35.478 --> 06:38.481
about your career paths after graduation.

06:38.689 --> 06:41.192
If you have any questions, write them down
and ask me in the next class.

06:41.275 --> 06:42.819
-Yes, ma'am.
-Thank you.

06:42.902 --> 06:44.654
-CLASS: Thank you.
-(applause)

06:47.698 --> 06:50.701
Gosh, that was so boring.

06:51.202 --> 06:53.246
Aren't classes after lunch just horrible?

06:53.579 --> 06:54.914
I'd rather run.

06:56.666 --> 06:59.961
What are you writing? What is it? Show me.

07:00.044 --> 07:02.296
-SUNYU: Everybody back to your seats!
-ARI: Goodness.

07:04.006 --> 07:05.007
(suspenseful music)

07:17.478 --> 07:20.606
Those who were dozing off during class
may stand up now.

07:24.485 --> 07:27.738
How dare you doze off during class
when your tuition is paid by taxes!

07:28.406 --> 07:31.159
Don't you call yourself a KNPU student!

07:31.534 --> 07:32.743
(thrilling music)

07:48.593 --> 07:50.344
If you don't stand up yourself,
you'll be in bigger trouble.

07:51.429 --> 07:52.597
This is a warning.

07:53.097 --> 07:54.599
Be honorable.

07:56.726 --> 07:57.643
(sighs)

08:11.616 --> 08:13.868
You. Why are you sitting?

08:14.660 --> 08:17.371
Me? I wasn't dozing.

08:17.455 --> 08:19.165
I saw you dozing.

08:19.248 --> 08:21.042
Who is she? I haven't seen that face.

08:21.959 --> 08:24.212
-She must have gotten an extra place.
-EUNKANG: No, I wasn't.

08:24.420 --> 08:26.797
I was pretty sleepy
because I didn't get much sleep,

08:27.798 --> 08:30.885
but I pinched my hand
not to doze off. Look.

08:31.677 --> 08:35.181
Hey. Do you think this is a joke?

08:36.307 --> 08:37.850
No, that's not what I...

08:37.934 --> 08:39.101
Stand up!

08:41.938 --> 08:44.148
-I'm sorry, ma'am.
-You'd better fly right.

08:44.565 --> 08:47.068
-I'll be keeping my eyes on you.
-Yes, ma'am.

08:47.151 --> 08:50.738
Those who stood up
will be given extra training.

08:50.821 --> 08:52.698
Assemble at the lounge
after classes. Understood?

08:52.782 --> 08:54.158
STUDENTS: Yes, ma'am!

09:14.762 --> 09:19.350
THE GIRL IN THE SPIDER'S WEB
ROMANCE OF THE THREE KINGDOMS

09:19.433 --> 09:22.436
THE GIRL IN THE SPIDER'S WEB

09:24.772 --> 09:25.606
(hidden cam beeps)

09:26.440 --> 09:27.358
-(thuds)
-(grunts)

09:27.817 --> 09:29.318
I'm sorry!
(groans)

09:29.694 --> 09:30.861
EUNKANG: I'm sorry!

09:31.112 --> 09:31.988
I'm sorry!

09:32.071 --> 09:33.656
-SUNYU: Can't hear you.
-EUNKANG: I'm sorry!

09:33.739 --> 09:35.866
DAEIL: I'm sorry!
(grunts)

09:36.284 --> 09:38.786
-EUNKANG: I'm sorry!
-(Daeil breathes heavily)

09:39.620 --> 09:40.871
-(loud thud)
-(grunts)

09:41.330 --> 09:42.623
I'm sorry!

09:43.165 --> 09:44.000
(groans)

09:45.543 --> 09:46.377
(metal clanks)

09:51.048 --> 09:53.092
Everyone, stand up.

10:03.561 --> 10:06.022
-You.
-Yes, sir. Freshman Ko Eunkang, sir.

10:06.105 --> 10:08.149
Do you know why
you're getting this extra training?

10:09.442 --> 10:11.444
Do you still not understand
what you did wrong?

10:12.528 --> 10:14.989
Honestly, no, sir.

10:15.364 --> 10:16.532
(foreboding music)

10:17.366 --> 10:19.118
I really wasn't dozing off.

10:19.660 --> 10:22.163
I can't say I was when I wasn't.

10:23.789 --> 10:26.792
Are you saying
it's your senior's misunderstanding?

10:27.126 --> 10:28.210
Yes, sir.

10:29.378 --> 10:32.381
I apologize if I sounded rude
earlier in the afternoon,

10:33.674 --> 10:34.842
But I don't think...

10:35.760 --> 10:39.013
I did anything to deserve
a beating with a baseball bat.

10:42.725 --> 10:43.559
Fine.

10:44.101 --> 10:46.062
Let's say
it was your senior's misunderstanding.

10:46.145 --> 10:47.938
Still, you're getting the extra training.

10:48.939 --> 10:50.149
May I ask why, sir?

10:50.232 --> 10:52.902
Let me tell you why. Listen carefully.

10:52.985 --> 10:56.197
HYUK: First, your actions were misleading.

10:56.614 --> 11:00.618
Second, you responded to
your senior's initial warning playfully.

11:01.410 --> 11:02.578
Third,

11:04.121 --> 11:06.123
you defied your senior.

11:06.207 --> 11:08.668
-But...
-You can't disobey your seniors' orders.

11:08.751 --> 11:11.962
That's the rule in this school and
fundamental of the police organization.

11:13.339 --> 11:16.092
-Do you have a problem with that?
-But...

11:27.687 --> 11:31.941
THE GIRL IN THE SPIDER'S WEB

11:32.149 --> 11:33.734
-(running water stops)
-(Eunkang sighs)

11:34.110 --> 11:34.944
(sniffles)

11:39.657 --> 11:40.908
(blowing nose)

11:42.660 --> 11:43.536
(sniffles)

11:44.328 --> 11:45.162
(sighs)

11:45.705 --> 11:47.623
I'm not even allowed to say it's unfair?

11:48.290 --> 11:49.458
Just hold it in.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.794
Otherwise, you'll get on
the wrong side of them.

11:51.877 --> 11:54.171
They were harsher on you
because you talked back at them.

11:54.255 --> 11:56.048
JUYOUNG: She's right. "The nail
that sticks out gets hammered down."

11:56.132 --> 11:59.051
Try not to stand out. Just say "Yes, sir",

11:59.135 --> 12:01.804
"Sorry, sir", "I'll get it right, sir."
That's all you have to say.

12:01.887 --> 12:03.639
EUNKANG: It's not like I married into
a Joseon-era family.

12:03.723 --> 12:05.558
I can't just remain silent like that.

12:05.641 --> 12:07.059
Then what, will you butt heads with them?

12:07.143 --> 12:09.645
I can at least say
what's not right is not right.

12:10.354 --> 12:12.231
-I just don't get it. It's...
-(door opens)

12:23.534 --> 12:24.535
(water trickling)

12:26.412 --> 12:27.580
(objects clattering)

12:48.934 --> 12:50.186
Gosh!

12:50.686 --> 12:52.855
DAEIL: I can't sleep
because I'm so hungry.

12:52.938 --> 12:55.900
I can't go to the canteen or outside.

12:56.650 --> 12:58.611
Like this is going
to make me a patient person.

13:03.282 --> 13:04.742
I want to have instant noodles.

13:06.368 --> 13:07.912
I want <i>jjajangmyeon</i>.

13:07.995 --> 13:09.330
I want a burger.

13:09.413 --> 13:10.623
I want some fried chicken.

13:11.207 --> 13:13.042
Half spicy, half regular.

13:13.209 --> 13:15.169
(all sighing)

13:23.052 --> 13:25.888
I know where instant noodles are.

13:28.724 --> 13:29.642
(door opens)

13:33.562 --> 13:34.438
(door creaks)

13:46.075 --> 13:48.744
Do you see the pantry room over there?

13:56.877 --> 13:59.421
TASTY NOODLE

14:03.676 --> 14:05.344
(woman singing faintly)

14:06.554 --> 14:08.180
BUMJU: <i>I was walking by the pantry
this afternoon,</i>

14:08.264 --> 14:10.099
<i>and I saw cup noodles inside.</i>

14:10.808 --> 14:12.852
<i>I think it's for the staff here.</i>

14:13.352 --> 14:14.770
So you want to steal them?

14:14.854 --> 14:16.981
-I guess we shouldn't.
-We shouldn't.

14:17.064 --> 14:18.482
Stealing is not right.

14:20.693 --> 14:23.612
Unless we leave a note.

14:25.865 --> 14:26.907
(tense music)

14:32.246 --> 14:34.290
(door opens)

14:48.053 --> 14:49.430
(footsteps approaching)

14:50.139 --> 14:53.642
(whispering)
Hey, come. Hurry.

15:06.780 --> 15:08.157
(all breathe heavily)

15:17.708 --> 15:19.418
(Daeil sighs)
Maybe next time.

15:20.085 --> 15:21.879
-Next time.
-Yes. Next time.

15:22.588 --> 15:23.589
Next time.

15:25.466 --> 15:26.759
(all breathe heavily)

15:27.635 --> 15:31.138
MALE TRAINER 1: Yell out for five seconds!

15:31.555 --> 15:34.767
(students yelling)

15:40.189 --> 15:41.565
SEUNGHYUN: Morning roll call report!

15:41.649 --> 15:44.109
Total 100 in all. No injuries.

15:44.193 --> 15:45.152
No absentees.

15:45.235 --> 15:48.405
Currently 100 present. No issues. Salute!

15:50.991 --> 15:54.244
Recite the honor pledge!

15:54.328 --> 15:56.830
STUDENTS: I affirm
that I will be an honest

15:56.914 --> 15:58.791
and honorable KNPU student

15:58.874 --> 16:01.710
who will not give in to injustice.

16:02.586 --> 16:05.005
MARTIAL ARTS INSTRUCTOR: All students
of this school

16:05.214 --> 16:10.594
are required to practice
kendo, hapkido, taekwondo, or judo.

16:10.678 --> 16:12.763
Today, you're taking
your first judo lesson.

16:12.846 --> 16:14.807
I'm going to show you
some of the practical moves

16:15.391 --> 16:17.309
that could come in handy
in real-life situations.

16:18.560 --> 16:19.478
(upbeat rhythmic music)

16:24.525 --> 16:25.484
(sighs)

16:28.487 --> 16:31.407
First, shoulder throw,
which is the most basic skill.

16:31.490 --> 16:33.450
SHOULDER THROW

16:33.534 --> 16:36.412
KNPU

16:36.996 --> 16:39.415
First, grab your opponent
by the lapel like this.

16:39.999 --> 16:42.960
Then knock him off balance
and at the same time...

16:43.961 --> 16:45.546
-(loud thud)
-(class murmuring)

16:48.966 --> 16:49.800
(grunts)

16:52.720 --> 16:53.762
You can sit down.

16:55.889 --> 16:59.351
Judo is a sport that requires
physical strength, but there's more to it.

16:59.435 --> 17:02.855
You can easily overpower your opponent
even if he or she is bigger than you.

17:07.276 --> 17:08.152
(exhales)

17:12.281 --> 17:16.035
When your opponent has a big build
like him, it'll be hard to approach him.

17:16.744 --> 17:17.953
In that case,

17:18.537 --> 17:22.499
penetrate the opponent's space
and gently turn around.

17:24.835 --> 17:25.669
(grunting)

17:26.045 --> 17:26.879
(gasping)

17:27.755 --> 17:28.589
(grunts)

17:28.797 --> 17:29.631
(sighs)

17:30.049 --> 17:33.469
All right. Sometimes,
your opponents are quite athletic.

17:33.969 --> 17:35.179
In that case...

17:38.724 --> 17:39.558
(groans)

17:40.893 --> 17:42.019
(class murmuring)

17:43.228 --> 17:44.354
(both grunting)

17:44.563 --> 17:48.567
Bend over and kick your opponent's leg
and press him with all your might.

17:50.194 --> 17:51.195
(screams)

17:51.945 --> 17:53.113
(class murmuring)

17:55.783 --> 17:56.617
(both grunting)

18:06.543 --> 18:07.669
(both panting)

18:10.714 --> 18:11.799
(class laughing)

18:13.717 --> 18:14.551
(whimpering)

18:14.635 --> 18:15.469
(tapping)

18:15.761 --> 18:17.387
-(both panting)
-(class murmuring)

18:21.934 --> 18:24.144
(class laughing)

18:29.483 --> 18:30.526
(instructor clears throat)

18:38.075 --> 18:39.076
(girls giggling)

18:47.209 --> 18:48.585
-I was going easy on him.
-(laughs)

18:52.131 --> 18:52.965
Hey.

18:53.048 --> 18:55.092
MEN'S CHANGING ROOM

19:02.850 --> 19:04.643
You almost got me.

19:06.186 --> 19:07.729
Is it fun lying to others?

19:07.813 --> 19:09.898
Why would you tell such an obvious lie?

19:09.982 --> 19:11.066
Lie?

19:11.483 --> 19:12.526
I didn't lie.

19:13.026 --> 19:15.487
Gosh! When I asked you
if you were my senior,

19:15.571 --> 19:17.698
you said yes in the corridor yesterday.

19:17.781 --> 19:19.283
I've never said that.

19:19.366 --> 19:21.827
You're the one who convinced yourself
to believe that.

19:21.910 --> 19:24.413
-I convinced myself?
-Yes. You did.

19:25.247 --> 19:28.876
Excuse me, but are you my senior?

19:31.170 --> 19:34.631
You didn't actually say
you were my senior,

19:36.258 --> 19:38.677
but you didn't deny it either.
And that's a yes.

19:39.219 --> 19:41.513
I was so flustered
I didn't know what to say.

19:41.805 --> 19:43.682
Wow! You didn't know what to say?

19:44.141 --> 19:46.435
What a great excuse!

19:46.518 --> 19:47.769
You should join Mensa
for having such a quick wit.

19:47.853 --> 19:49.771
You lie like a rug. Let me see your rug.

19:49.855 --> 19:51.106
You know what?

19:51.190 --> 19:53.567
SEUNGHYUN: If this is because
you're embarrassed by your own stupidity,

19:54.151 --> 19:56.111
it's okay. I already forgot about it.

19:56.695 --> 19:57.821
What?

19:59.323 --> 20:00.407
Hey.

20:00.490 --> 20:03.827
Wait. Stop. Are you avoiding me now?

20:06.288 --> 20:07.664
Gosh!

20:08.707 --> 20:10.417
-He's a hero?
-Yes.

20:11.835 --> 20:15.088
"Please stop. How can she say yes
under this pressure?"

20:16.465 --> 20:17.799
He was so cool.

20:17.883 --> 20:20.469
Wow. He's acting like
a different person here.

20:20.552 --> 20:23.972
Don't let him fool you.
He's actually calculative and petty.

20:24.056 --> 20:25.432
He's one of those who want

20:25.515 --> 20:27.809
all the presents they gave to
their girlfriends back after breaking up.

20:27.893 --> 20:29.228
No! Really?

20:29.311 --> 20:30.479
Yes.

20:30.896 --> 20:33.690
But how do you know that?
Do you know each other?

20:33.774 --> 20:36.068
No, we don't.
I don't want to talk about this anymore.

20:36.151 --> 20:39.571
I just wanted you to know that
he's not the kind of guy you think he is.

20:40.155 --> 20:40.989
(sighs)

20:41.531 --> 20:44.201
I see. I thought he was the cutest here.

20:44.785 --> 20:47.788
Come on.
Wasn't that other boy kind of cute?

20:47.871 --> 20:50.624
Was he Kim Tak? The one who came through
special admission for athletes.

20:50.707 --> 20:53.752
He's got such broad shoulders.
He looks so strong.

20:53.835 --> 20:55.587
(grumbles)
He's not my type.

20:56.088 --> 20:58.131
He kind of looks dumb.

20:58.423 --> 20:59.258
(water running)

21:02.177 --> 21:03.595
What about you?

21:05.222 --> 21:06.682
I'm not interested.

21:07.474 --> 21:09.518
We're not allowed
to date other students anyway.

21:10.477 --> 21:11.311
(locker door slams)

21:16.441 --> 21:18.026
ARI: It was just a hypothetical question.

21:18.110 --> 21:20.112
She's so annoying.

21:20.195 --> 21:21.863
JUYOUNG: Come on. Leave her alone.

21:21.947 --> 21:23.782
At least she's honest.

21:23.865 --> 21:25.075
I don't care!

21:29.538 --> 21:30.455
(whoops)

21:41.091 --> 21:41.925
(clears throat)

21:42.551 --> 21:47.222
I heard you were an athlete.
What did you do? Soccer? Judo? Wrestling?

21:47.306 --> 21:48.140
Judo.

21:48.223 --> 21:49.057
Aha.

21:49.725 --> 21:52.102
I did some sports too when I was little.

21:53.687 --> 21:56.982
(shouting loudly imitates punching)

21:59.985 --> 22:03.363
I wanted to become a short-track skater
when I was in elementary school.

22:03.780 --> 22:04.614
(exhales sharply)

22:04.906 --> 22:06.158
DAEIL: All right.

22:06.241 --> 22:09.328
From now on, you're on Team Yoo.

22:10.871 --> 22:12.122
Team Yoo.

22:12.873 --> 22:14.875
I'll help you grow. You can count on me.

22:19.880 --> 22:21.298
(quirky music)

22:22.674 --> 22:24.301
But I'm bigger than you.

22:25.927 --> 22:26.845
Huh?

22:29.973 --> 22:30.807
(Daeil sighs)

22:31.183 --> 22:34.269
Hey, your body build isn't everything.

22:34.728 --> 22:37.856
Brain. You need to have a smart brain.
My brain with your...

22:39.649 --> 22:40.776
body.

22:41.526 --> 22:42.694
We'll be invincible.

22:43.487 --> 22:44.821
Let's be good friends.

22:51.828 --> 22:52.746
Hey.

22:57.209 --> 22:58.293
You'd better watch out.

23:01.004 --> 23:03.965
Hey! Watch out for what?

23:04.049 --> 23:05.258
-That burns!
-Oh, no. I'm sorry.

23:06.510 --> 23:09.137
DAEIL: It burns!

23:09.221 --> 23:10.430
BUMJU: Water!

23:10.722 --> 23:12.849
(Daeil screaming)
Stop! It's cold!

23:13.975 --> 23:16.728
(yelping)
It's cold!

23:18.021 --> 23:19.981
Cold! It's so cold!

23:20.482 --> 23:22.442
-DAEIL: It's cold!
-(laughing)

23:26.029 --> 23:29.366
By the way, are we not allowed
to date other students?

23:29.449 --> 23:32.577
Right. I heard it's like an unspoken rule.

23:32.661 --> 23:35.664
I heard the student council would give you
a warning if you hang out with a boy.

23:35.747 --> 23:37.249
Because it distracts the students
from their studies.

23:37.332 --> 23:39.960
That's so mean.
They don't even let us date?

23:40.043 --> 23:41.253
I actually think it's a great rule.

23:41.378 --> 23:44.005
What if they break up?
It's going to be so awkward.

23:44.089 --> 23:45.882
It's a small school. No way.

23:46.258 --> 23:47.509
(indistinct chattering)

23:48.593 --> 23:50.345
Do you have a boyfriend here?

23:50.429 --> 23:52.180
What? No.

23:53.932 --> 23:56.685
-Yes, you do.
-No. Not yet.

23:56.893 --> 23:58.019
"Not yet"?

23:58.103 --> 23:59.020
(Ari breathes deeply)

23:59.771 --> 24:01.815
-Who is it?
-No.

24:01.898 --> 24:04.401
Is he our senior? Which year?
Come on. Just tell me.

24:04.484 --> 24:05.610
I don't.

24:07.028 --> 24:08.530
Yes, you do.

24:08.780 --> 24:09.614
(chomps)

24:14.953 --> 24:16.580
(dreamy music)

24:18.081 --> 24:19.791
I'll get going. I'll see you around.

24:19.875 --> 24:21.460
-Are you already finished?
-EUNKANG: Yes.

24:37.309 --> 24:38.226
(sighs)

24:39.019 --> 24:41.480
I never got to tell him I got accepted.

24:45.942 --> 24:48.153
Where did she go?
She didn't even take her jacket.

24:52.657 --> 24:54.242
-All right. See you around.
-TAK: Bye.

24:55.035 --> 24:55.869
(Ari grunts)

24:56.161 --> 24:58.163
-SEUNGHYUN: Sorry.
-ARI: It's okay.

25:02.834 --> 25:03.668
(object clatters)

25:11.593 --> 25:12.719
Is it Eunkang's?

25:12.802 --> 25:13.970
(suspenseful music)

25:20.310 --> 25:21.686
Which one is mine?

25:23.939 --> 25:25.315
HYUK: Left, face.

25:27.317 --> 25:28.777
Forward, march.

HYUK: Left, left, left.

25:45.919 --> 25:47.879
To the rear, march.

25:47.963 --> 25:49.589
STUDENTS: One, two. three.

25:50.298 --> 25:51.883
MALE TRAINER 1: Mind the person
next to you!

25:51.967 --> 25:53.593
HYUK: Change step, march.

25:53.677 --> 25:54.636
STUDENTS: One, two.

HYUK: Left, left.

25:57.722 --> 25:59.516
SUNYU: Keep your distance!

26:01.059 --> 26:02.352
MALE TRAINER 2: Focus!

26:07.941 --> 26:10.402
(Yugon on computer)
<i>It shows that the perpetrator was</i>

26:11.069 --> 26:15.865
<i>continuously stabbing the victim

(chomping)

26:16.866 --> 26:17.742
<i>Using logical reasoning,</i>

26:17.826 --> 26:22.205
this is presumed to be
a premeditated crime motivated by grudges.

26:22.664 --> 26:26.334
However,
there's still a question unsolved.

26:27.043 --> 26:30.255
<i>The crime was committed

26:30.338 --> 26:32.465
<i>on a holiday afternoon.</i>

26:36.261 --> 26:37.095
(keyboard clacks)

26:37.178 --> 26:38.221
That was nice.
(sniffs)

26:38.305 --> 26:39.931
I sure have increased the show's ratings.

YUGON: Have you seen the newspaper?
(sips)

27:05.790 --> 27:08.710
Of course I have.
It's the eighth most trending topic now.

on an empty stomach

27:15.175 --> 27:16.301

27:17.135 --> 27:19.512
Why is he doing this to us?

27:19.596 --> 27:21.598
What have we done to him?

27:21.681 --> 27:23.391
There are many reasons.

27:24.559 --> 27:25.393
He thinks it's absurd

27:25.477 --> 27:28.938
that recent graduates lead the cops
because they lack practical experience.

27:29.022 --> 27:30.982
That's the same with the prosecution.

27:31.191 --> 27:33.234
Those young prosecutors
are still wet behind the ears,

27:33.318 --> 27:34.903
yet they boss around the older cops.

27:35.612 --> 27:36.863
Let's be honest.

27:36.946 --> 27:39.991
It's because the constables have
issues with getting promoted, right?

27:45.872 --> 27:47.082
It's okay.

27:47.791 --> 27:49.918
I'm not from this school,

27:50.001 --> 27:52.629
but I'm a KNPU person now.

27:54.339 --> 27:55.757
What do you think, Professor Cha?

27:55.965 --> 27:56.883
(breathes deeply)

27:57.258 --> 27:59.260
Well, they always bring this up
every now and then.

27:59.678 --> 28:02.514
No, but it seems
a little more serious this time.

28:02.597 --> 28:05.225
-They're even holding a hearing about it.
-Then...

28:06.351 --> 28:08.937
the school might actually
get abolished this time.

28:09.020 --> 28:10.438
Professor Cha.

28:11.940 --> 28:13.274
Well, to be honest,

28:13.358 --> 28:16.444
over 40% of police executives
are KNPU graduates.

28:16.528 --> 28:18.988
Of course, the rest feel excluded.

28:19.072 --> 28:21.074
That's what causes
continuous internal conflict.

28:21.157 --> 28:23.034
What are you talking about?

28:23.118 --> 28:25.412
You don't just become
an executive officer.

28:25.495 --> 28:28.373
You need to get the training
and pass the promotion exam.

28:28.998 --> 28:31.084
How could you trivialize

28:31.167 --> 28:33.962
your seniors' and juniors' efforts
when you're a KNPU graduate yourself?

28:34.045 --> 28:35.380
I'm not trivializing anything.

28:36.423 --> 28:39.676
-That's how it looks to outsiders...
-Stop it.

28:39.926 --> 28:41.636
You're not here to have a fight.

28:42.178 --> 28:44.139
I called you in to tell you to make sure

28:44.222 --> 28:46.683
to take extra care of the students
since it seems serious.

28:46.975 --> 28:49.686
Professor Cha will be
in charge of freshmen this year.

28:50.395 --> 28:53.106
And Professor Bang,
you're the guidance counselor.

28:53.189 --> 28:55.692
You know what will happen
if students cause trouble at this point.

28:56.109 --> 28:57.694
It will only help the abolitionist.

28:59.320 --> 29:00.947
Fall into four rows!

29:01.030 --> 29:02.157
-BUMJU: Mark. One!
-Two!

29:02.240 --> 29:03.992
-Three!
-Four! End of order!

29:05.160 --> 29:06.578
-JUYOUNG: Fall in.
-TAK: Fall in.

29:06.661 --> 29:07.787
Fall in!

29:07.871 --> 29:08.705
(screaming)
Come out!

29:10.582 --> 29:12.125
-TAK: Run.
-MALE TRAINER 1: One.

29:12.792 --> 29:13.752
Two.

29:14.377 --> 29:15.462
Three.

29:16.171 --> 29:17.130
Four.

29:17.672 --> 29:19.841
One, two, three, four.

29:19.924 --> 29:24.345
-HYUK: You disappointed me greatly.
-MALE TRAINER 1: One, two, three, four.

29:24.429 --> 29:26.681
-You're not improving at all.
-MALE TRAINER 1: One, two.

29:26.973 --> 29:28.558
HYUK: You think this place is a joke?

29:29.017 --> 29:30.643
STUDENTS: Sorry, sir!

29:31.269 --> 29:32.145
Get up.

29:32.562 --> 29:33.605
(grunting)

29:35.273 --> 29:36.316
-HYUK: Get down.
-(sighs)

29:37.984 --> 29:39.569
-HYUK: Get up.
-(Daeil grunts)

29:41.446 --> 29:44.741
Do burpees
until your colleagues finish running.

29:45.325 --> 29:46.743
STUDENTS: Yes, sir!

29:49.120 --> 29:50.371
STUDENTS: One.

29:51.831 --> 29:53.041
Two.

29:54.459 --> 29:55.668
STUDENTS: Three.

29:57.837 --> 29:58.880
STUDENTS: Four.

30:00.423 --> 30:01.508
STUDENTS: Five.

30:02.884 --> 30:04.135
STUDENTS: Six.

30:05.053 --> 30:06.054
(suspenseful music)

30:09.390 --> 30:10.391
STUDENTS: Eight.

30:12.310 --> 30:13.520
STUDENTS: Nine.

30:14.646 --> 30:15.480
STUDENTS: Ten.

30:17.565 --> 30:18.858
STUDENTS: Eleven.

30:19.984 --> 30:21.277
STUDENTS: Twelve.

30:24.280 --> 30:25.740
STUDENTS: Thirteen.

30:28.451 --> 30:29.494
STUDENTS: Fourteen.

30:31.746 --> 30:32.997
STUDENTS: Fifteen.

30:35.083 --> 30:36.251
STUDENTS: Sixteen.

30:38.336 --> 30:39.504
STUDENTS: Seventeen.

30:40.380 --> 30:41.798
STUDENTS: Eighteen.

30:41.881 --> 30:42.966
You. Stop.

30:43.049 --> 30:44.133
STUDENTS: Nineteen.

30:44.217 --> 30:45.385
Can't you hear me?!

30:45.927 --> 30:46.928
STUDENTS: Twenty.

30:48.346 --> 30:49.889
-Twenty-one.
-Is this yours?

30:49.973 --> 30:51.140
Well...

30:51.224 --> 30:52.517
-STUDENTS: Twenty-two.
-Answer me.

30:53.184 --> 30:55.019
Yes, sir. Freshman Ko Eunkang, sir.

30:55.103 --> 30:57.188
Starting now, you're out of the training.

30:57.272 --> 30:58.147
Yes...

30:58.940 --> 31:01.484
-Pardon?
-Wait in your room until there's an order.

31:01.818 --> 31:02.819
What?

31:09.784 --> 31:11.160
This is...

31:15.081 --> 31:16.791
Why did you film this in secret?

31:17.083 --> 31:18.585
I didn't film it.

31:18.668 --> 31:19.836
Will you keep denying it?

31:20.587 --> 31:24.090
I, your senior, saw it
fall out of your jacket!

31:25.258 --> 31:29.679
I don't know either
why it was in my jacket.

31:30.263 --> 31:32.348
If you don't come clean about it,
as the chief trainer,

31:32.432 --> 31:36.269
I'll tell the authorities that we should
consider canceling your admission,

31:36.352 --> 31:38.521
-as you have disgraced the school's name.
-What?

31:38.605 --> 31:40.565
Student Life Act,
Section four, article 45.

31:40.648 --> 31:42.984
"The school's education and facilities
are supposed to be kept confidential.

31:43.067 --> 31:43.985
Disclosure of the information

31:44.068 --> 31:47.447
or possession and distribution
of any documents, photos, or videos

31:47.530 --> 31:49.198
that may damage others' honor and dignity

31:50.074 --> 31:51.826
can be a good reason
for the cancellation of admission."

31:52.368 --> 31:55.121
I really didn't do it. Please believe me.

31:55.204 --> 31:57.332
A student disciplinary committee
will be set up soon.

31:58.207 --> 31:59.375
Save your breath until then.

32:12.931 --> 32:15.892
HYUK: <i>You'll stay in the detention room
until told otherwise.</i>

32:16.893 --> 32:18.353
(somber music)

32:26.027 --> 32:26.903
(sighs)

32:35.370 --> 32:36.996
(Yangchul humming)

32:37.997 --> 32:40.583
-(phone ringing)
-(humming continues)

32:42.335 --> 32:43.419
Yes.

32:43.878 --> 32:46.172
Hi, Uncle. How are you feeling?

32:46.714 --> 32:48.800
Oh, right. Have I told you

32:49.217 --> 32:52.762
that Eunkang got into the school?

32:53.221 --> 32:54.847
You know, KNPU.
(chuckles)

32:55.974 --> 32:58.810
Korean National Police University!
(laughs)

32:58.893 --> 33:02.188
When she graduates from school,
she'll be a lieutenant right away.

33:02.271 --> 33:05.358
A lieutenant is as high
as a chief constable.

33:05.775 --> 33:07.944
Oh, come on. Not that high.

33:08.695 --> 33:11.322
Why won't he pick up the phone? Come on!

33:12.156 --> 33:13.074
Geez.

33:13.157 --> 33:16.202
Hey, Uncle. It's me, Yangchul.

33:16.869 --> 33:19.080
Your nephew living in Seoul.

33:19.163 --> 33:25.294
Anyway, I feel so safe now
to have a cop in the family.

33:25.670 --> 33:29.298
Actually, if you ever have
to go to a police station, call me.

33:29.382 --> 33:30.842
Don't hesitate to ask.
(laughs)

33:30.925 --> 33:33.302
And please say hi to Aunt.

33:33.386 --> 33:35.513
Okay. No need to come.

33:35.596 --> 33:36.806
Bye.

33:37.515 --> 33:38.558
(laughing)

33:39.392 --> 33:41.686
Why would you say something like that?

33:41.769 --> 33:43.896
What if he actually calls you?

33:43.980 --> 33:46.482
I'm just trying to be nice. Don't worry.

33:46.566 --> 33:47.984
You know my uncle.

33:48.067 --> 33:51.446
He's never visited Korea
ever since he moved abroad.

33:51.529 --> 33:54.449
Because he didn't want to spend
money on airfare. Don't you worry.

33:54.532 --> 33:55.658
YANGCHUL: Uncle, check.

33:55.742 --> 33:58.327
Hey, did you call your friend too?

33:58.619 --> 33:59.495
My friend?

33:59.954 --> 34:01.664
You know, your friend
from elementary school

34:01.748 --> 34:04.417
who lives in Hannam-dong
and always drives foreign cars.

34:04.542 --> 34:06.544
(yelps)
You mean Miran.

34:07.128 --> 34:09.297
-I can't call her.
-Why not?

34:09.422 --> 34:10.631
(laughing)

34:11.174 --> 34:12.425
What is it?
(chuckles)

34:12.550 --> 34:13.760
(laughing)

34:15.011 --> 34:16.596
What is so funny?

34:17.055 --> 34:18.514
You know, her daughter was preparing

34:18.598 --> 34:20.600
-for the college entrance exam again.
-Yes.

34:20.683 --> 34:22.810
-I heard she wasn't accepted.
-Again?

34:22.894 --> 34:25.646
Yes, and I heard Miran totally
lost her mind and is in misery

34:25.730 --> 34:30.109
because she practically poured money
into her daughter's tuition.

34:30.818 --> 34:33.696
She always said
kids need expensive private tutors.

34:34.447 --> 34:37.283
(scoffs)
We never got our daughter any tutor,

34:37.366 --> 34:38.868
but she got in anyway.

34:39.035 --> 34:40.036
(Yangchul scribbling)

34:40.161 --> 34:43.915
That proves money isn't everything.

34:45.208 --> 34:46.042
(both chuckle)

34:46.250 --> 34:47.919
Look at you, all excited.

34:48.336 --> 34:49.796
Hang on.

34:50.088 --> 34:51.089
Let me see.

34:51.172 --> 34:54.217
Are you so happy to hear
that Miran is in misery?

34:54.300 --> 34:55.468
Are you?

34:55.551 --> 34:57.303
No, I'm not!

34:57.386 --> 34:59.222
-Stop it!
-(both laughing)

35:02.391 --> 35:05.353
But why was that in here?

35:06.354 --> 35:09.440
Gosh! I just can't believe this!

35:27.166 --> 35:28.876
Hey, did you hear?

35:29.377 --> 35:33.172
Eunkang secretly filmed us
getting training and punishment.

35:34.257 --> 35:36.926
I think it's serious.
I heard she'd be expelled.

35:39.846 --> 35:41.055
ARI: Is it Eunkang's?

35:45.810 --> 35:46.936
Which one is mine?

35:47.770 --> 35:48.604
(clicks tongue)

35:49.105 --> 35:50.356
Oh, well.

35:53.776 --> 35:55.653
<i>That was a spy cam?</i>

35:56.988 --> 35:57.822
(sighs)

35:58.114 --> 35:59.699
Whatever. It's not mine.

36:00.449 --> 36:02.493
It's not mine, so it must be hers.

36:04.829 --> 36:05.663
(exhales sharply)

36:32.523 --> 36:33.858
(quirky music)

36:35.401 --> 36:36.235
(door opens)

36:52.126 --> 36:53.961
(moaning)

36:54.045 --> 36:55.129
I love this.

36:58.007 --> 36:59.717
-(slurps)
-(swallows)

36:59.800 --> 37:00.843
(sighs)

37:01.344 --> 37:04.972
The salt is invigorating
all my cells. Right?

37:05.598 --> 37:07.266
DAEIL: This is why salt is essential.

37:07.350 --> 37:10.895
Even Napoleon told his subordinates
to bring salt before they had a battle.

37:11.520 --> 37:13.356
Stop that and give it.

37:14.732 --> 37:15.858
TAK: Leave some.

37:16.609 --> 37:18.319
I know you're going to finish it all.

37:19.570 --> 37:22.198
(blows, slurps)

37:22.448 --> 37:24.075
(slurps, munching)

37:24.450 --> 37:25.409
(exhales)

37:26.911 --> 37:28.704
Did you leave a note?

37:29.163 --> 37:30.248
Of course.

37:42.885 --> 37:45.513
TASTY NOODLE

37:50.476 --> 37:51.644
BUMJU: <i>Let us borrow
some of your noodles.</i>

37:51.727 --> 37:53.312
<i>We're just like Jean Valjean,</i>

37:53.396 --> 37:55.314
<i>the man who stole bread out of hunger.</i>

37:55.398 --> 37:58.859
<i>We promise to give you the money
when the training period is over.</i>

38:00.236 --> 38:02.571
SEUNGHYUN: I wonder why the guy
on night duty wasn't there today.

38:03.656 --> 38:05.074
DAEIL: I think he went to a meeting.

38:05.700 --> 38:06.701
At this time?

38:06.784 --> 38:09.704
Well, it's an emergency. They're probably
having an emergency meeting.

38:11.330 --> 38:12.581
(slurping)

38:12.832 --> 38:14.875
Do you think Ko Eunkang will be expelled?

38:16.460 --> 38:19.005
Of course. They'll definitely punish her.

38:19.088 --> 38:21.215
-But isn't it a bit too much to expel her?
-BUMJU: I know.

38:21.299 --> 38:24.302
DAEIL: You guys really have no idea
what this means.

38:25.177 --> 38:27.680
This is actually a serious matter.

38:28.723 --> 38:32.059
If the video of us getting punished
and harassed spreads on the internet,

38:32.768 --> 38:36.564
in the worst case, the dean can get fired.

38:36.647 --> 38:38.774
I don't think that was her intention.

38:39.692 --> 38:42.320
She was trying to
screw over the chief trainer.

38:43.070 --> 38:45.531
Anyway, it's only a matter of time
until she's expelled.

38:46.324 --> 38:48.242
She's in the detention room now,
so be careful.

38:48.743 --> 38:50.578
-We're not allowed to talk to her.
-Why?

38:50.661 --> 38:52.121
Did you doze off at the orientation?

38:52.663 --> 38:55.041
According to school regulations,
we can't talk to students

38:55.124 --> 38:56.959
who are being punished.

38:59.003 --> 39:01.255
-But did she really do it?
-(Daeil slurping)

39:01.839 --> 39:03.257
Of course!

39:03.341 --> 39:05.217
They found the evidence on the spot.

39:06.385 --> 39:07.928
TAK: Hey, that's enough for you.

39:08.012 --> 39:10.056
Hey, stop eating. Leave some for me.

39:11.057 --> 39:12.224
MALE STUDENT 1: That's Ko Eunkang.

39:12.641 --> 39:14.310
(students clamoring)

39:20.232 --> 39:21.275
MALE STUDENT 2: Eunkang?

39:23.027 --> 39:24.862
How does she even have an appetite?

39:29.241 --> 39:31.160
DAEIL: She's one tough cookie. Right?

39:33.621 --> 39:35.039
What did you eat?

39:35.122 --> 39:36.874
I don't know. My stomach hurts.

39:36.957 --> 39:39.377
-Again?
-Hey, I've got to go.

39:39.794 --> 39:41.337
-Hey.
-EUNKANG: Ari.

39:41.879 --> 39:42.963
Ari.

39:50.930 --> 39:53.224
Sorry. I know you're not
allowed to talk to me right now,

39:53.307 --> 39:55.851
-but I have a question for you.
-What is it?

39:56.769 --> 39:59.939
I'm looking for the person
who took the video, but I'm lost.

40:00.398 --> 40:03.734
As I remember, I took off
my jacket exactly twice yesterday.

40:03.818 --> 40:05.861
At the martial arts class
and in the cafeteria.

40:05.945 --> 40:06.779
And?

40:06.862 --> 40:10.074
And you took my jacket
when you left the cafeteria.

40:10.408 --> 40:13.577
-Did you...
-Hey, are you suspecting me?

40:13.911 --> 40:17.164
No. I'm just wondering
if you saw anyone touch my jacket.

40:17.248 --> 40:18.541
I don't know. I didn't see anyone.

40:18.791 --> 40:21.168
Please try to remember.
This is very important to me.

40:21.252 --> 40:22.336
I don't know.

40:22.420 --> 40:25.297
You left your jacket,
so I brought it to you. That's all.

40:26.757 --> 40:27.591
(door opens)

40:33.305 --> 40:34.473
-(sighs)
-(door closes)

40:35.724 --> 40:36.934
(suspenseful music)

40:48.112 --> 40:51.490
OFFICE PANTRY

41:01.250 --> 41:02.877
YUGON: <i>She denies it?</i>

41:02.960 --> 41:04.003
Yes, sir.

41:04.670 --> 41:06.172
Did you check the security cameras?

41:06.255 --> 41:08.674
The cameras on the first and second floor
in the dorm are taken way

41:08.757 --> 41:10.342
for the time being
because of the waterproofing repairs.

41:10.426 --> 41:12.094
So you couldn't check the cameras.

41:12.178 --> 41:13.971
-No, sir.
-Then how are you so sure

41:14.054 --> 41:15.681
that Ms. Ko Eunkang did it?

41:15.764 --> 41:17.933
First of all, she was the one
carrying the evidence.

41:18.017 --> 41:21.437
The video clip was filmed
after Ms. Ko entered the school.

41:21.979 --> 41:23.981
Nothing was filmed before that.

41:25.024 --> 41:25.900
(sighs)

41:26.525 --> 41:27.443
(breathes deeply)

41:28.194 --> 41:31.197
We can't cancel the admission
just because she could have done it.

41:31.655 --> 41:35.951
Just like we can't arrest someone
for having a weapon in his or her jacket.

41:36.327 --> 41:37.828
Plus, you said she denies it.

41:37.912 --> 41:40.789
But she's been showing a bad attitude
throughout the training too.

41:41.832 --> 41:44.919
This is a serious issue,
so we've got to be discreet.

41:45.753 --> 41:48.339
Make sure this doesn't get out.

41:48.422 --> 41:50.174
Have you reported this to Professor Bang?

41:50.257 --> 41:52.301
-Not yet.
-YUGON: I'll do it.

41:53.219 --> 41:55.596
We need to set up
a student disciplinary committee anyway.

41:56.180 --> 41:58.015
-Yes, sir.
-You can go now.

42:03.646 --> 42:04.522
(door opens)

42:05.564 --> 42:06.857
-(breathes deeply)
-(door closes)

42:10.569 --> 42:11.487
(Yugon exhales sharply)

42:11.570 --> 42:14.365
While the security cameras
are taken away...

42:15.407 --> 42:16.242
(breathes)

42:16.867 --> 42:19.495
It means this person knows
well about what's going on here.

42:28.337 --> 42:30.589
NAMGI: The Gangneung Poseo-dong Case
is a case

42:31.131 --> 42:34.385
where a perverted man
broke into over 40 empty apartments

42:34.468 --> 42:36.220
where single women lived

42:36.303 --> 42:38.889
and stole their money, valuables,
and lingerie.

42:38.973 --> 42:41.308
The culprit has been arrested.

42:41.892 --> 42:44.645
A special fluorescent material was used
to solve this case,

42:44.728 --> 42:46.605
which is not visible to the naked eye.

42:46.689 --> 42:48.524
You apply it to the places
where the criminal is likely to touch

42:48.607 --> 42:50.401
as he or she enters the house.

42:50.484 --> 42:52.236
Then, under a UV light,

42:53.153 --> 42:55.864
-as you can see, it appears like this.
-(class murmuring)

42:58.075 --> 43:01.662
This material was developed in the UK,
but now it's produced in Korea too.

43:01.745 --> 43:04.039
So it's easy to purchase online.

43:05.124 --> 43:06.625
Next, luminol.

43:07.585 --> 43:09.461
It's used to detect bloodstains.

43:10.045 --> 43:12.131
It reacts to oxidants or metals...

43:13.173 --> 43:14.633
It was so upsetting.

43:14.717 --> 43:16.760
I wish I could take lectures
like this every day.

43:18.554 --> 43:21.307
(sighs)
I wish we have special lectures every day.

43:21.390 --> 43:22.975
Today's lecture was really interesting.
Wasn't it?

43:23.058 --> 43:24.685
What? Right.

43:24.768 --> 43:25.853
Shin Ari.

43:27.479 --> 43:28.814
Can I talk to you for a second?

43:28.897 --> 43:29.982
(mouthing)
Me?

43:30.441 --> 43:31.567
I'll see you around.

43:37.114 --> 43:38.157
ARI: What is it?

43:38.449 --> 43:39.908
Do you want me to say it or do you?

43:41.660 --> 43:43.787
I saw you in front of the cafeteria
that day.

43:44.246 --> 43:45.247
SEUNGHYUN: All right. See you around.

43:46.248 --> 43:47.082
Sorry.

43:51.086 --> 43:51.920
(object clatters)

43:52.755 --> 43:53.589
(Ari grunts)

43:57.551 --> 43:58.636
Is it Eunkang's?

44:05.976 --> 44:08.312
I'm not sure what you're talking about?
What did you see?

44:08.395 --> 44:09.396
You know what I mean.

44:10.356 --> 44:12.691
Is that it? Then I'll get going.

44:13.108 --> 44:14.485
I gave you a chance.

44:15.194 --> 44:17.946
A chance to be honest. And you blew it.

44:31.293 --> 44:32.711
Ari!

44:33.379 --> 44:35.589
I'm so happy for you.
What did he say? Did he ask you out?

44:35.673 --> 44:36.757
Get off me.

44:48.310 --> 44:49.353
JUYOUNG: What's wrong with her?

44:49.770 --> 44:52.731
MALE TRAINERS: One, two, three, four.

44:52.815 --> 44:53.857
MALE TRAINERS: One.

44:54.316 --> 44:55.317
MALE TRAINERS: Two.

44:55.859 --> 44:56.902
MALE TRAINERS: Three.

44:57.403 --> 44:58.529
MALE TRAINERS: Four.

44:59.071 --> 45:02.116
MALE TRAINERS: One, two, three, four.

45:02.199 --> 45:05.119
MALE TRAINERS: One, two, three, four.

45:05.202 --> 45:06.662
(whistle blowing)

45:12.251 --> 45:13.460
(suspenseful music)

45:18.424 --> 45:19.633
MALE TRAINER 1: One.

45:19.967 --> 45:20.884
Two.

45:21.260 --> 45:22.302
Three.

45:22.386 --> 45:23.595
Four.

45:24.096 --> 45:25.097
One.

45:25.681 --> 45:26.807
Two.

45:27.182 --> 45:28.058
Three.

45:28.434 --> 45:29.268
Four.

45:29.727 --> 45:30.644
One.

45:31.103 --> 45:31.937
Two.

45:32.354 --> 45:33.397
Three.

45:34.231 --> 45:35.649
(suspenseful music continues)

45:37.276 --> 45:38.819
(crockery clanking)

45:48.203 --> 45:52.416
EUNKANG: <i>Cafeteria, gym,
cafeteria, restroom.</i>

45:53.000 --> 45:55.919
<i>Dormitory, schoolyard.</i>

45:56.128 --> 45:57.129
(sighs)

45:57.921 --> 45:58.756
(breathes deeply)

45:59.715 --> 46:01.300
It has to be here.

46:04.303 --> 46:06.305
(exhales)
I should ask Ari again.

46:10.392 --> 46:11.351
(gasps)
Goodness.

46:16.148 --> 46:18.984
Did Wi Seunghyun tell you anything?

46:19.067 --> 46:20.986
Wi Seunghyun? Tell me what?

46:21.236 --> 46:22.070
Ah...

46:22.738 --> 46:23.781
Well...

46:27.451 --> 46:28.368
I did it.

46:29.495 --> 46:30.788
The spy cam.

46:31.497 --> 46:32.498
I put it in your jacket.

46:32.581 --> 46:34.291
-What?
-ARI: I'm sorry.

46:34.374 --> 46:36.710
I didn't know it was a spy cam.

46:36.794 --> 46:39.046
-I thought it fell out of your jacket.
-Hey!

46:39.129 --> 46:42.716
Why are you saying this now?
Because of you, I'm...

46:43.258 --> 46:44.092
(sighs)

46:44.510 --> 46:46.011
I'm about to be expelled.

46:46.094 --> 46:50.015
But it's not mine either. Believe me.

46:51.475 --> 46:53.310
-Let's go.
-Where?

46:53.393 --> 46:55.354
The training corp's office, of course.

46:55.437 --> 46:56.563
No.

46:56.647 --> 46:59.942
Eunkang, I'll help you find who did it.

47:00.025 --> 47:01.527
So please don't tell them about me.

47:01.610 --> 47:03.362
If we find who did it,
it will be all right.

47:03.445 --> 47:05.364
-What?
-Once this gets out,

47:05.906 --> 47:08.200
I won't be able to study here.
(sobbing)

47:08.283 --> 47:10.577
Whatever. That's none of my business.

47:10.786 --> 47:12.287
I have to clear my name.

47:17.835 --> 47:19.586
Eunkang.

47:20.128 --> 47:20.963
(sentimental music)

47:21.046 --> 47:21.880
(sighs)

47:25.133 --> 47:28.804
ARI: <i>But it's not mine either.
Believe me.</i>

47:29.179 --> 47:32.683
I'm not a saint. This is not the time
to worry about others.

47:35.561 --> 47:38.272
(breathes deeply)

47:41.275 --> 47:45.195
Once this gets out,
I won't be able to study here.

48:02.796 --> 48:03.672
(clears throat)

48:04.006 --> 48:05.340
-How could you do that?
-What?

48:06.216 --> 48:08.385
I understand you don't like me,

48:08.468 --> 48:11.597
but how could you not do anything
when your colleague is being framed?

48:11.680 --> 48:13.807
I can't lie just to clear your name.

48:13.891 --> 48:15.559
I heard you saw Ari putting
the spy cam in my jacket.

48:15.642 --> 48:17.978
No, I didn't. I don't have super eyesight.

48:18.061 --> 48:20.355
-How could I have seen it?
-What?

48:20.439 --> 48:22.107
Did you lie to Ari then?

48:22.190 --> 48:24.234
I said I saw her putting something
in the jacket,

48:24.318 --> 48:25.819
but I never said it was a spy cam.

48:26.320 --> 48:27.779
I guess she was feeling guilty.

48:27.863 --> 48:28.697
(scoffs)

48:29.781 --> 48:31.533
Are you happy now? I'll get going then.

48:31.617 --> 48:32.743
Ari said it wasn't her.

48:33.952 --> 48:35.704
She was just afraid
she'd be accused of it.

48:35.787 --> 48:37.247
She didn't film the video.

48:37.915 --> 48:40.208
Which means it's done by someone else.

48:40.292 --> 48:41.418
We need to find that person.

48:41.501 --> 48:44.338
-Are you going to find that person?
-Of course I should.

48:45.547 --> 48:47.007
It's just not fair

48:47.090 --> 48:49.718
that innocent Ari and I have to fight
because of that person.

48:49.801 --> 48:51.553
I just can't let that happen.

48:52.387 --> 48:54.765
Great attitude. Good luck.

48:55.223 --> 48:56.475
Are you just leaving like that?

48:57.476 --> 48:58.644
Help me.

48:59.102 --> 49:01.563
I can't do this alone.
I'm in detention now,

49:01.647 --> 49:03.732
so I'm not allowed to talk
to the other kids.

49:03.815 --> 49:06.568
I have to find this person before
the disciplinary committee is set up.

49:07.152 --> 49:09.279
Otherwise, I'll be expelled.
(whimpering)

49:10.948 --> 49:12.366
That's not your thing.

49:14.034 --> 49:14.993
(clears throat)

49:15.077 --> 49:17.371
I'm sorry, but you'll have to do it
on your own.

49:17.454 --> 49:19.456
I hate getting involved
in others' business.

49:20.040 --> 49:22.125
That's not true. You like it.

49:22.209 --> 49:25.462
The girls said you were like a hero.
You meddled with my sister's business too.

49:25.545 --> 49:28.298
-I had no choice then. But now...
-I am...

49:28.715 --> 49:30.050
an innocent citizen.

49:30.634 --> 49:35.806
Will you just sit back and watch
an innocent citizen suffer like this?

49:35.931 --> 49:36.807
(quirky music)

49:36.890 --> 49:39.101
You shouldn't be like that.

49:39.184 --> 49:43.188
If you want to be a cop,
you should protect innocent citizens.

49:43.271 --> 49:45.941
Could there be any better reason
why you should help me?

49:46.817 --> 49:47.651
(scoffs)

49:51.405 --> 49:52.239
(zipper zips)

50:03.542 --> 50:04.376
(both gasp)

50:04.793 --> 50:06.378
(both grunting)

50:06.878 --> 50:08.922
(breathes heavily)

50:09.589 --> 50:10.424
(grunts)

50:13.468 --> 50:14.761
(breathing heavily)

50:14.845 --> 50:17.806
-TAK: Were you caught?
-Gosh, we were almost caught.

50:20.600 --> 50:24.062
-That's so many.
-One for each of us.

50:26.064 --> 50:27.649
What if they notice it?

50:27.733 --> 50:30.235
Even if they do,
they wouldn't know it's us.

50:30.360 --> 50:31.194
(both laugh)

50:31.278 --> 50:32.154
(knocks on door)

50:34.114 --> 50:37.451
DAEIL: <i>But there's no such thing
as a perfect crime.</i>

50:41.538 --> 50:42.831
(knocks on door)

50:46.501 --> 50:48.086
(knocking on door continues)

50:49.504 --> 50:50.505
May I help...

50:51.590 --> 50:52.424
(grunts)

50:53.133 --> 50:54.134
All right.

50:55.093 --> 50:56.553
My, you're one good-looking boy.

50:57.804 --> 51:01.725
It was you, right?
The ones who stole my cup noodles.

51:03.810 --> 51:05.020
DAEIL: <i>She was...</i>

51:05.812 --> 51:08.023
<i>Mrs. Sherlock.</i>

51:09.066 --> 51:11.693
THREE DAYS BEFORE THE ARREST

51:15.781 --> 51:18.158
One, two, three, four,

51:18.742 --> 51:21.745
five, six...

51:22.496 --> 51:23.580
Six...

51:25.957 --> 51:27.334
Oh, boy.

51:27.417 --> 51:29.211
LET US BORROW SOME OF YOUR NOODLES...

51:48.146 --> 51:52.526
TWO DAYS BEFORE THE ARREST

51:54.152 --> 51:55.946
(janitress exhales sharply)

51:59.449 --> 52:02.160
DAEIL: <i>She realized the cup noodles
in the pantry room were disappearing,</i>

52:02.244 --> 52:04.913
<i>so she started to observe
people around the room.</i>

52:12.671 --> 52:16.842
<i>♪ The person ♪</i>

52:18.844 --> 52:22.430
<i>♪ In a yellow shirt... ♪</i>

52:25.058 --> 52:26.309
Is it her?

52:32.315 --> 52:34.734
NAMGI: A special fluorescent material
was used to solve this case,

52:34.818 --> 52:36.236
which is not visible to the naked eye.

52:36.695 --> 52:38.238
DAEIL: <i>She got
a special fluorescent material.</i>

52:38.864 --> 52:40.448
<i>Then when it's under UV light,</i>

52:40.574 --> 52:42.659
<i>and applied it on the cup noodles.</i>

53:06.933 --> 53:07.851
(door closes)

53:25.243 --> 53:26.369
(suspenseful music)

53:31.833 --> 53:32.667
(gasps)

53:32.876 --> 53:34.044
(laughs)

53:35.086 --> 53:36.963
I got you, you punks.

53:39.966 --> 53:43.220
DAEIL: <i>We stole the cup noodles,
having no idea we fell into her trap.</i>

53:44.721 --> 53:46.223
-May I help...
-DAEIL: <i>And...</i>

53:47.265 --> 53:50.310
-<i>she caught us red-handed.</i>
-JANITRESS: It was you, right?

53:50.393 --> 53:52.020
JANITRESS: The ones who stole
my cup noodles.

53:52.771 --> 53:55.398
There will be a brief inspection.

53:55.857 --> 53:57.734
Let me see your hands.

53:58.360 --> 53:59.486
Good. I can see it very well.

54:00.070 --> 54:02.489
My goodness.

54:03.782 --> 54:04.991
You punks.

54:05.575 --> 54:09.120
They say the sparrow
near a school sings the primer.

54:09.871 --> 54:13.458
I've been cleaning at this school
for 30 years now. Okay?

54:13.541 --> 54:17.629
I've been listening to these lectures
of criminal investigation for years.

54:18.505 --> 54:21.132
Now, get on your knees!

54:21.591 --> 54:23.510
Move. Move!

54:24.552 --> 54:26.012
Hands up. Come on.

54:26.096 --> 54:28.181
-Hands...
-That must hurt.

54:28.265 --> 54:29.933
Go easy now.
(chuckles)

54:32.227 --> 54:36.773
EUNKANG: Ari said she found the spy cam
in front of the cafeteria.

54:37.315 --> 54:39.651
Which means it was already in the jacket.

54:40.151 --> 54:41.695
(breathes deeply)

54:43.488 --> 54:44.489
(suspenseful music)

54:44.656 --> 54:46.199
Maybe it was planted in the cafeteria.

54:53.123 --> 54:56.126
No, that's not it.
Then Ari must have seen it.

54:56.209 --> 54:57.085
Hmm...

54:58.211 --> 55:00.338
We had a martial arts class
in the morning, right?

55:00.755 --> 55:01.673
It's not there.

55:02.340 --> 55:04.634
We all put our jackets in the cabinets
and locked them.

55:06.428 --> 55:07.554
(metal clanking)

55:08.096 --> 55:10.265
EUNKANG: <i>And I put it on again
right after the class.</i>

55:10.348 --> 55:12.475
<i>Nobody would have been able
to put anything in there.</i>

55:14.311 --> 55:16.688
-Maybe the jacket was switched.
-What?

55:16.771 --> 55:19.024
Maybe it wasn't that
someone put it in your jacket

55:19.107 --> 55:20.483
but your jacket had been switched.

55:21.359 --> 55:23.737
Switched? When...

55:25.530 --> 55:27.240
It was just a hypothetical question.

55:28.074 --> 55:29.284
She's so annoying

55:37.000 --> 55:39.878
EUNKANG: <i>Right. If it wasn't Ari's...</i>

55:41.796 --> 55:42.672
Whose is it?

55:44.591 --> 55:46.676
-What do I do now?
-NAMGI: <i>Don't worry.</i>

55:46.760 --> 55:49.429
<i>There were no security cameras there,
so no one would know it was you.</i>

55:49.512 --> 55:51.264
I might be in trouble.

55:52.515 --> 55:53.350
(sighs)

55:53.725 --> 55:55.685
Whatever, I don't know.

55:55.769 --> 55:58.438
I was just doing as you said.
Even if someone finds out, I'm not...

56:00.023 --> 56:01.608
POLICE

56:05.111 --> 56:06.863
Hey. Who's there?

56:06.946 --> 56:09.991
I think I'm lost.
I'm looking for the dorm.

56:10.075 --> 56:12.577
The dorm is that way.

56:12.660 --> 56:13.578
(chuckles)

56:13.661 --> 56:14.829
Hurry and go.

56:14.913 --> 56:17.999
It's time for roll call soon.
You're not supposed to wander around here.

56:18.083 --> 56:19.250
Yes, sir.

56:20.126 --> 56:21.586
(ominous music)

56:24.839 --> 56:25.965
(thrilling music)

56:36.267 --> 56:38.520
EUNKANG: <i>If Ari took the jacket
because she thought it was hers,</i>

56:38.895 --> 56:40.855
<i>it has to be someone
who used the cabinet nearby.</i>

56:41.898 --> 56:43.191
I'm not interested.

56:43.775 --> 56:45.735
We're not allowed
to date other students anyway.

56:47.529 --> 56:50.657
EUNKANG: <i>The person who left the jacket
right next to her was...</i>

56:52.200 --> 56:53.410
I'm done.

56:53.993 --> 56:55.286
EUNKANG: Maybe she's busy.

56:55.370 --> 56:57.872
No, she's not.
We all have the same schedule.

57:04.421 --> 57:05.380
(sighs)

57:07.048 --> 57:08.466
PORTABLE FLASHLIGHT

57:09.300 --> 57:10.844
(suspenseful music)

57:20.854 --> 57:22.564
If the camera was rolling...

57:22.647 --> 57:24.816
-Sorry, sir!
-Sorry, sir!

57:24.899 --> 57:25.775
THE GIRL IN THE SPIDER'S WEB

57:25.859 --> 57:27.819
EUNKANG: <i>There's got to be
a charger somewhere.</i>

57:28.403 --> 57:29.863
Where did she put it?

57:32.574 --> 57:34.284
(suspenseful tense music)

57:51.050 --> 57:51.926
(object clatters)

58:09.944 --> 58:11.779
(suspenseful tense music continues)

58:52.278 --> 58:53.863
(music intensifies)

59:02.080 --> 59:03.081
(doorknob clicks)

59:13.049 --> 59:14.300
(door opens)

59:20.598 --> 59:22.850
(closing theme music)
