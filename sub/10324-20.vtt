<i>My name is Earl.</i>

00:03.636 --> 00:07.037
<i>[Earl Narrating]Joy and Darnell were out</i>
<i>of Witness Protection and back in Camden...</i>

00:07.140 --> 00:10.871
<i>which meant me and Randy had a few things</i>
<i>to fix from our time livin'in their trailer.</i>

00:10.977 --> 00:14.606
I ain't never seen anything like this before!
It's everywhere.

00:14.714 --> 00:18.673
It's not my fault the cops chased that guy
in here or that he fought back.

00:18.785 --> 00:20.650
Just scrub that guy off my wall, dummy.

00:20.754 --> 00:23.814
Then go outside and pull down
all that crime scene tape.

00:23.923 --> 00:25.823
<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>After years in hiding...</i>

00:25.925 --> 00:29.452
<i>Darnell was excited to surface again</i>
<i>using his real name, Harry Monroe.</i>

00:29.562 --> 00:32.258
It's nice to finally
get on the Internet again as Harry.

00:32.365 --> 00:34.526
Man, have I got a lot of e-mails to return.

00:34.634 --> 00:37.102
Don't get any ideas
about going by Harry again.

00:37.203 --> 00:39.671
Took me a long time to remember
to say "Darnell" during sex...

00:39.773 --> 00:41.741
and I'm not startin' from scratch.

00:41.841 --> 00:45.868
Mommy, I finished unpacking all your clothes
and picked the bugs off of the flypaper.

00:45.979 --> 00:47.708
Will space camp take me now?

00:47.814 --> 00:49.941
[Hisses, Sighs]

00:50.050 --> 00:52.348
Unfortunately, they just called, baby...

00:52.452 --> 00:56.946
and said that future astronauts
also have to wash Mama's dishes.

01:00.593 --> 01:04.620
Hey, Dodge. Are you going
to Chaz Dalton's Space Academy?

01:04.731 --> 01:08.064
Me and Randy went when we were kids.
It's the awesomest camp of all time.

01:08.168 --> 01:10.136
You know, Chaz Dalton went to outer space.

01:10.236 --> 01:11.931
Plus, he walked on the moon.

01:12.038 --> 01:15.474
And he was the first person
to sneeze in space and survive.

01:15.575 --> 01:17.941
Earl, why are you so gay for space?

01:18.044 --> 01:19.875
[High-pitched Voice]
I'm not gay for space.

01:19.979 --> 01:22.709
Yeah, he's gay for the men who went to space.
There's a difference.

01:22.816 --> 01:24.909
[Normal Voice]
I'm not gay for astronauts.

01:25.018 --> 01:29.478
But if you had to be gay, you'd pick astronauts,
and of all them, you'd pick Chaz.

01:29.589 --> 01:31.557
<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>Well, Randy had me there.</i>

01:31.658 --> 01:34.752
<i>Chaz was a true hero, and he was on my list.</i>

01:34.861 --> 01:37.887
<i>The week I spent at the Space Academy</i>
<i>was the greatest week of my life.</i>

01:37.997 --> 01:39.658
- Hey!
- Hey!

01:39.766 --> 01:43.099
<i>At first I thought it was gonna suck like</i>
<i>everything else my parents made me do.</i>

01:43.203 --> 01:46.229
<i>But that all changed when I met Chaz Dalton.</i>

01:59.185 --> 02:01.085
Good morning, cadets.

02:01.187 --> 02:05.021
I'm Chaz Dalton,
and I've been to outer space.

02:05.125 --> 02:07.093
- <i>Wow!</i>
- <i>That's awesome!</i>

02:09.295 --> 02:12.264
This is the actual suit
that I wore on my mission.

02:12.365 --> 02:14.265
<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>Camp was the first time...</i>

02:14.367 --> 02:17.666
<i>I'd ever been interested in learning</i>
<i>about anything, and I was a good cadet-</i>

02:17.770 --> 02:20.671
You better pay attention,
or I'll open your throat like a juice box!

02:20.773 --> 02:22.741
<i>In my own way.</i>

02:25.812 --> 02:28.679
<i>But I wanted to do more</i>
<i>than just learn from Chaz Dalton.</i>

02:28.781 --> 02:31.579
<i>I wanted to</i> be <i>Chaz Dalton.</i>

02:35.155 --> 02:37.988
<i>For once in my life,</i>
<i>I stole somethin'for a positive reason.</i>

02:38.091 --> 02:40.616
<i>And I even planned on bringin'it back.</i>

02:45.999 --> 02:47.933
<i>I felt like a real astronaut.</i>

02:48.034 --> 02:51.470
<i>I was even weightless-</i>
<i>at least between jumps.</i>

02:54.841 --> 02:57.309
<i>I stayed up all night</i>
<i>livin'my astronaut dream...</i>

02:57.410 --> 02:59.810
<i>and by mornin'that space suit</i>
<i>was pretty dirty.</i>

02:59.913 --> 03:04.612
<i>So I decided to wash it and return it to</i>
<i>the Space Academy as clean as I'd stolen it.</i>

03:04.717 --> 03:06.981
<i>Apparently,</i>
<i>space suits are a match for space...</i>

03:07.086 --> 03:11.955
<i>but no match for a large,</i>
<i>energy-inefficient '70s-era dryer.</i>

03:12.058 --> 03:14.083
<i>I felt so bad about ruinin'it...</i>

03:14.194 --> 03:16.856
<i>I never went back to finish camp.</i>

03:16.963 --> 03:19.625
<i>Me and Randy hadn't been back</i>
<i>to Space Academy since...</i>

03:19.732 --> 03:23.828
<i>and as soon as I walked in,</i>
<i>I felt like a kid again.</i>

03:23.937 --> 03:26.235
Everybody be aware of where they are.

03:26.339 --> 03:29.706
You have to admit, he wears 20 years well.

03:31.211 --> 03:34.203
Man, I've never been this nervous
about a list item before.

03:34.314 --> 03:36.748
Do-Do you think American space heroes
like chocolates?

03:36.849 --> 03:39.545
- It's not too late to go buy doughnuts.
- You know what?

03:39.652 --> 03:42.519
If you go back and forth
on this one more time, I'm punching you.

03:42.622 --> 03:47.582
<i>Great work today, cadets. America'd</i>
<i>be proud of you fine men and women.</i>

03:47.694 --> 03:50.322
Now it's time for a potty break.

03:50.430 --> 03:53.126
Even if you don't have to go, try.

03:53.233 --> 03:56.202
[Chattering]

03:58.004 --> 04:00.973
- Don't embarrass me.
- Don't embarrass me!

04:06.546 --> 04:08.446
E-E-Excuse me...

04:08.548 --> 04:10.812
Mr. Astronaut, sir.

04:10.917 --> 04:13.477
Uh, I was wondering
if I could talk to you about something...

04:13.586 --> 04:15.747
that happened here when I was a little boy.

04:15.855 --> 04:18.756
I've never had children in the office
unless the door was open. Permanent policy.

04:18.858 --> 04:22.760
No, no. Wait, wait.
We used to go to camp here, and-

04:22.862 --> 04:25.797
I stole your space suit.

04:25.898 --> 04:28.423
<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>I told Chaz all about the list...</i>

04:28.534 --> 04:30.434
<i>and how I turned my life around...</i>

04:30.536 --> 04:33.061
<i>and about how sorry I was for what I'd done.</i>

04:33.172 --> 04:36.437
Anyway, I feel awful about what I did.

04:36.542 --> 04:40.171
You're the only American hero
I've ever shaken hands with...

04:40.280 --> 04:42.407
other than Ted Nugent.

04:42.515 --> 04:44.949
But of all the bad things I've ever done-

04:45.051 --> 04:47.246
I'm not gonna cry.

04:47.353 --> 04:50.982
I'm just really sorry
for what I did to your suit...

04:51.090 --> 04:53.149
and to you-

04:53.259 --> 04:56.126
- I'm gonna cry.
- You don't have to make it up to me, Earl.

04:56.229 --> 04:59.756
I forgive you.
It's enough that you finally told the truth.

04:59.866 --> 05:02.835
Oh, my God.

05:02.935 --> 05:05.870
You're still teaching me lessons.

05:05.972 --> 05:08.941
Kids like you are the reason
why I do this.

05:09.042 --> 05:11.010
You know what fuels the space shuttle?

05:11.110 --> 05:13.601
- Dreams.
- Dreams.

05:21.788 --> 05:24.313
I'm gonna get you that space suit.

05:24.424 --> 05:28.155
Earl! I just found out
there's a planet called- [Laughing]

05:28.261 --> 05:30.161
Ura-

05:31.597 --> 05:33.792
Ura- Ura-

05:33.900 --> 05:35.527
[Laughing Continues]

05:37.136 --> 05:39.331
Wait. I forgot. I'll be right back.

05:42.542 --> 05:44.737
You been on that computer a lot.

05:44.844 --> 05:46.812
Nobody likes a black nerd, Darnell.

05:46.913 --> 05:49.643
You know that's why I won't let
EarlJunior get those prescription glasses.

05:49.749 --> 05:52.980
Baby, I'm just on BuddyBook. It's a social
networking site that connects you with friends.

05:53.086 --> 05:56.522
It's like what MySpace and Facebook
used to be before all the old people ruined it.

05:56.622 --> 06:00.251
- <i>[Computer Chirping]</i>
- Hear that? It means I got another friend request.

06:00.360 --> 06:04.524
- I'm up to 320.
- 320 friends?

06:04.630 --> 06:06.928
Are you tryin' to
get on the prom court or somethin'?

06:07.033 --> 06:09.934
I mean, why would you need that many friends?
Everybody knows you only need two.

06:10.036 --> 06:13.335
Poor friend to make you feel rich
and a fat friend to make you feel skinny.

06:13.439 --> 06:16.602
<i>If you're lucky like me,</i>
<i>you get both in one, like Eugenia.</i>

06:17.810 --> 06:20.176
Who's this old bag hangin' on you?

06:20.279 --> 06:23.009
- That's Margaret Thatcher.
- Mmm.

06:23.116 --> 06:26.176
Well, at least I know
you're not bangin' her.

06:26.285 --> 06:28.753
Not anymore.

06:28.855 --> 06:30.982
<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>To find a new space suit for Chaz...</i>

06:31.090 --> 06:33.524
<i>me and Randy went to</i>
<i>the nearest NASA field office.</i>

06:33.626 --> 06:35.992
<i>And lucky for us, they validated parking.</i>

06:36.095 --> 06:38.791
I asked, and it seems like
we don't sell space suits.

06:38.898 --> 06:40.729
But I'm going to call another office.

06:40.833 --> 06:43.529
Cape Kennedy is a little more loosey-goosey.

06:43.636 --> 06:45.900
You can wait over there
by the wall of astronauts.

06:46.005 --> 06:48.701
Do you have aliens here?

06:48.808 --> 06:51.709
If you'll wait over there. Thanks.

06:53.379 --> 06:56.280
They definitely keep the aliens here,
don't you think?

06:56.382 --> 06:59.112
Maybe. It was a big issue
in the election a few months ago.

06:59.218 --> 07:01.186
Catalina wouldn't shut up about it.

07:01.287 --> 07:06.088
Don't tell her I said this, but I don't think
they <i>should</i> have the same rights as us.

07:06.192 --> 07:08.752
Hey, look. It's Chaz.

07:09.862 --> 07:11.727
<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>It was the right name...</i>

07:11.831 --> 07:13.662
<i>but that picture wasn't the Chaz I knew.</i>

07:13.766 --> 07:16.428
No, it's not.

07:16.536 --> 07:18.800
Son of a bitch!

07:24.777 --> 07:26.904
Earl, that's not the dude from Camden.

07:27.013 --> 07:29.982
I know. I can't believe this guy,
pretending to be a hero...

07:30.082 --> 07:32.448
gettin' kids all excited about space camp.

07:32.552 --> 07:35.077
For God's sakes,
Dodge's middle name is "Chaz."

07:35.188 --> 07:37.088
You know what we gotta do, Randy?

07:37.190 --> 07:39.283
We gotta find the real Chaz
and get some answers.

07:39.392 --> 07:41.724
<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>While we went to search for the real Chaz...</i>

07:41.828 --> 07:43.853
<i>Joy was making it easier</i>
<i>for people to find her.</i>

07:43.963 --> 07:47.990
Once we get you BuddyBookin', you'll find out
there's nothin' to be threatened by, baby. Okay?

07:48.100 --> 07:50.295
- Sex.
- Love it.

07:50.403 --> 07:53.304
- Race?
- American.

07:53.406 --> 07:56.432
- Sexual orientation.
- Reverse cowboy.

07:56.542 --> 08:00.000
- Occupation?
- Pimp. No, wait. Hustler.

08:00.112 --> 08:03.081
No, wait. Big baller.

08:03.182 --> 08:06.310
You know what? Just put "mom."

08:06.419 --> 08:08.614
- Hometown?
- Your face.

08:08.721 --> 08:10.780
That's funny, isn't it?

08:10.890 --> 08:12.721
- Political views?
- Gop.

- Favorite book.
- Phone.

08:18.364 --> 08:20.332
See? It's not some big secret.

08:20.433 --> 08:22.401
Now we just put out a friend request.

08:22.502 --> 08:24.936
Once the people approve you,
they'll show up in your friend list.

08:25.037 --> 08:27.301
Oh, snap!
There's a place to put a picture.

08:27.406 --> 08:30.204
I'm gonna use the one of me posin'
with that deer I ran over.

08:30.309 --> 08:32.777

<i>and a ride to her boyfriend's house...</i>

<i>that NASA lady gave us Chaz's address.</i>

08:35.548 --> 08:38.210
I don't know exactly
what words I'm gonna use, but...

08:38.317 --> 08:40.911

to hear the truth.

08:41.020 --> 08:44.421

<i>So he doesn't look like one. That's okay.</i>

08:58.337 --> 09:00.168
He's still an American hero.

09:00.273 --> 09:02.400
Excuse me, Mr. Dalton?

09:02.508 --> 09:05.705
I got a religion and all the Bibles I need.

09:05.811 --> 09:08.075
Earl, he thinks we'reJojoba Witnesses.

09:08.180 --> 09:10.978
Now get off of my lawn!

09:12.218 --> 09:15.278
Look, there's a guy in Camden
impersonating you.

09:15.388 --> 09:20.348
He's been at it for years. He's got a camp
called the Chaz Dalton Space Academy.

09:20.459 --> 09:23.087
- What?
- I know. It's terrible.

09:23.195 --> 09:26.528

09:31.337 --> 09:35.671
Hell, yeah, he's been makin' money-
on your glorious coattails. Tons of it.

09:35.775 --> 09:39.973
He drives a Saturn S.V.U. He's even got
a credit card just for the gas station.

09:40.079 --> 09:42.411
If you'll allow me
to escort you to Camden...

09:42.515 --> 09:46.076
it'd be my honor to walk you into
that impostor academy, that hall of lies...

09:55.328 --> 09:58.263
No deal! Earl, let's get out of here.

09:58.364 --> 10:01.731

<i>what a real American hero looks like.</i>

11:18.477 --> 11:21.844
Fight, fight, fight,
fight, fight, fight, fight!

11:21.947 --> 11:24.415
You scared, impostor Chaz?

11:24.517 --> 11:27.953
- My name is Wayne.
- Oh, is it Wayne?

11:28.054 --> 11:30.750
Or is Wayne another name you stole
from an American hero...

11:30.856 --> 11:35.190
likeJohn Wayne
or Wayne Newton or Dwayne Wayne?

11:35.294 --> 11:38.730
He's tellin' the truth.

11:38.831 --> 11:41.732
<i>[Earl Narrating] Turns out Wayne</i>
<i>worked with Chaz back at NASA.</i>

11:41.834 --> 11:44.132
<i>Wayne wanted to be an astronaut</i>
<i>more than anything...</i>

11:44.236 --> 11:48.536
<i>but he kept gettin'passed over</i>
<i>'cause he was born with female-sized lungs.</i>

11:48.641 --> 11:51.610
<i>Oh, hey, Wayne!</i>
<i>[Grunts]</i>

11:51.711 --> 11:54.839
Hey. Oh. That throttle looks clean.

11:54.947 --> 11:56.676
Listen, I wanted to ask you something.

11:56.782 --> 12:01.242
You think you could maybe go to this
park opening thing in Camden for me?

12:01.353 --> 12:03.947
I'll pay you 50 bucks. I hate crowds.

12:04.056 --> 12:06.616
- Nobody's gonna believe I'm you.
- Oh, Wayne.

12:06.726 --> 12:09.695
People respect astronauts.
They don't know what we look like.

12:09.795 --> 12:11.763
It's the helmets, you know.

12:11.864 --> 12:14.458
Come on. Give it a try.

12:14.567 --> 12:17.866
If you're lucky, there might be
some space groupies there.

12:17.970 --> 12:21.736
Maybe even someJohn Glenn
hasn't gotten to yet.

12:21.841 --> 12:23.934
But doubtful.

12:24.043 --> 12:27.035
<i>[Earl Narrating] And the next day Camden</i>
<i>gathered a group of American heroes...</i>

12:27.146 --> 12:29.114
<i>to honor the late Paul Lynde...</i>

12:29.215 --> 12:31.649
<i>who had once stopped in town</i>
<i>for a sandwich.</i>

12:31.751 --> 12:36.347
And then the space shuttle reaches
the speed of 17,000 miles per hour.

12:36.455 --> 12:39.515
Wow. You're the greatest
American hero I've ever met.

12:39.625 --> 12:41.559
Sorry, Dad.

12:41.660 --> 12:43.753
<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>And Wayne pulled it off.</i>

12:43.863 --> 12:46.957
<i>He was a hero among heroes.</i>

12:47.066 --> 12:49.034
I can't believe you did that.

12:49.135 --> 12:52.901
You put the "ass" in astronaut.
You put the "not" in astronaut.

12:53.005 --> 12:54.905
Zing!

12:55.007 --> 12:59.444
I'm sorry. I, uh-

13:01.413 --> 13:04.439
l-I guess this place belongs to you.

13:04.550 --> 13:07.678
Do you mind if I get the other half
of my sandwich out of the fridge?

13:07.787 --> 13:09.755
I was gonna have that for din-

13:09.855 --> 13:11.755
Never mind.

13:13.626 --> 13:17.653
- It better not have been a hero sandwich!
- Bye, Chaz.

13:17.763 --> 13:19.958
<i>[Earl Narrating] The next mornin'</i>
<i>I was so excited about announcin'...</i>

13:20.065 --> 13:22.465
<i>that a real astronaut</i>
<i>was takin'over the academy.</i>

13:22.568 --> 13:25.162
<i>Me and Randy even made a curtain</i>
<i>out of comforters from the motel.</i>

13:25.271 --> 13:28.138
So, any of you kids allowed on BuddyBook?

13:28.240 --> 13:32.370
Good morning, campers.
We have a special surprise for you.

13:32.478 --> 13:35.777
It's my pleasure to introduce
a true American hero.

13:38.484 --> 13:41.351
- Get off of my lawn!
- <i>[Children Gasping]</i>

13:43.756 --> 13:47.021
[Laughing]

13:51.664 --> 13:54.861
[Slurring]
I'm all right. I can walk from here.

13:54.967 --> 13:58.164
- [Grunts]
- What the hell are you doin'?

13:58.270 --> 14:00.170
I just took some anxiety pills.

14:00.272 --> 14:04.003
Well, anxiety pills smell
a lot like scotch and Dentyne Ice.

14:04.109 --> 14:06.077
Don't make me go back out there.

14:06.178 --> 14:08.976
<i>I'm not a real hero.</i>

14:09.081 --> 14:11.174
I'm also a fraud.

14:11.283 --> 14:14.411
<i>[Earl Narrating] Turns out, Chaz wasn't</i>
<i>exactly who I thought he was either.</i>

14:14.520 --> 14:16.886
<i>He only got to be an astronaut...</i>

14:16.989 --> 14:20.083
<i>'cause his dad was a senator</i>
<i>who gave fundin'to NASA.</i>

14:20.192 --> 14:23.161
<i>And the other astronauts hated him for it.</i>

14:27.132 --> 14:30.659
<i>Some people might have worked hard</i>
<i>to prove themselves in that situation...</i>

14:30.769 --> 14:32.669
<i>but not Chaz.</i>

14:32.771 --> 14:36.867
<i>All he cared about before takeoff</i>
<i>was eatin'as much real food as possible.</i>

14:38.777 --> 14:41.371
- <i># When I die and they lay me to rest #</i>
- <i>[Man] We have liftoff.</i>

14:41.480 --> 14:43.710
<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>And after the shuttle finally launched...</i>

14:43.816 --> 14:46.307
<i>Chaz suddenly discovered</i>
<i>he was claustrophobic...</i>

14:46.418 --> 14:48.409
<i>had motion sickness</i>
<i>and was afraid ofheights.</i>

14:48.520 --> 14:50.852
- <i># Goin'up to the spirit in the sky ##</i>
- I don't like it!

14:50.956 --> 14:52.856
I don't like it!

14:53.959 --> 14:56.086
<i>[Voices On Radio, Indistinct]</i>

14:56.195 --> 15:00.564
[Screaming]

15:00.666 --> 15:03.226
I'm not a hero.

15:03.335 --> 15:05.235
I blew it.

15:05.337 --> 15:08.135
They had to cut the mission short
'cause I threatened to kill myself.

15:08.240 --> 15:10.640
<i>I thought enough time had gone by...</i>

15:10.743 --> 15:14.008
but when I thought of those little kids,
I just-

15:14.113 --> 15:16.081
I just couldn't do it.

15:16.181 --> 15:19.446
But they look up to you.
L-I can't let you break their hearts.

15:19.551 --> 15:21.519
They don't look up to <i>me.</i>

15:21.620 --> 15:24.851
There's Chaz Dalton, the man,
and Chaz Dalton, the myth.

15:24.957 --> 15:28.484
They look up to the myth.
This whole place is a myth!

15:28.594 --> 15:32.257
You know, I'm gonna go out there
and tell 'em I'm shuttin' the camp down.

15:32.364 --> 15:34.264
[Grunts]

15:34.366 --> 15:36.960
I mean, they're all paid up, right?
Hey, kids!

15:37.069 --> 15:38.969
Camp's closing!

15:40.739 --> 15:42.673
There are no heroes!

15:42.775 --> 15:44.675
That's it!

15:44.777 --> 15:47.473
<i>[Earl Narrating] I knew what I was</i>
<i>doin'wasn't right, but I was pissed.</i>

15:47.579 --> 15:50.548
Let go of me!

15:50.649 --> 15:55.109
I'm not gonna let those kids find out
how bad it hurts when you lose your hero!

15:55.220 --> 15:57.518
And then you think you find your real hero...

15:57.623 --> 16:00.592
and it turns out
he's not your real hero either!

16:00.693 --> 16:03.218
- <i>Are you crying?</i>
- No.

16:03.329 --> 16:06.594
<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>Dealing with Chaz was gonna have to wait...</i>

16:06.699 --> 16:09.759
<i>because there was an entire room ofkids</i>
<i>hopin'there was more to space camp...</i>

16:09.868 --> 16:12.666
<i>than watchin'a drunk astronaut</i>
<i>battle with gravity.</i>

16:12.771 --> 16:15.262
[Boys] Five, six, seven, eight.
Try to keep your thumb straight.

16:15.374 --> 16:18.832
<i>So me and Randy decided</i>
<i>to try runnin'the space camp ourselves.</i>

16:18.944 --> 16:21.504
<i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>we didn't know a lot about space-</i>

16:21.613 --> 16:24.605

Three, two, one, blastoff!

16:24.717 --> 16:27.015

<i>Or runnin'things.</i>

16:29.455 --> 16:33.516
- All right, campers. Helmets on.

Bags off. Bags off.

16:47.906 --> 16:50.704
<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>Eventually, the kids caught on.</i>

16:50.809 --> 16:54.438
<i>We tried our hardest,</i>
<i>but sometimes your hardestjust sucks.</i>

16:54.546 --> 16:57.811
- Show us how to walk on the moon.
- Okay.

16:57.916 --> 17:01.477
<i>#Come on</i>
<i>Let's go space truckin'#</i>

17:01.587 --> 17:04.681
<i>#Come on, come on ##</i>

17:04.790 --> 17:07.190
That's not how you do it.

17:08.961 --> 17:11.054
- <i>[Door Alarm Chimes]</i>
- Chaz. You show us.

17:11.163 --> 17:12.994
- <i>Yeah! Please.</i>
- <i>Chaz!</i>

17:13.098 --> 17:17.831
I know I said I wouldn't come back,
but I really do wanna get that half a sandwich.

17:17.936 --> 17:20.063
Will you show us the right way
to walk on the moon?

17:20.172 --> 17:24.336
- <i>Yeah, Chaz, please!</i>
- Yeah. Come on.

17:26.211 --> 17:28.236
All right. But then you have to leave.

17:29.615 --> 17:31.583
Okay. Everybody up.

17:31.683 --> 17:35.744
Now remember, you never move too fast...

17:35.854 --> 17:38.516
and you look before you step...

17:38.624 --> 17:41.593
<i>'cause there's lots and lots of craters...</i>

17:41.693 --> 17:45.026
and I think Alan Shepard
left a few golf tees up there.

17:45.130 --> 17:47.428
Do you think I could be an astronaut?

17:47.533 --> 17:51.162
- Definitely, with some hard work.
- What about me?

17:51.270 --> 17:54.831
<i>[Earl Narrating] I didn't like it, but I</i>
<i>couldn't deny Wayne was good with the kids-</i>

17:54.940 --> 17:56.703
<i>and Randy.</i>

17:56.809 --> 17:59.903
<i>I didn't know what to do.</i>
<i>Luckily, someone else did.</i>

18:00.012 --> 18:03.812
Chaz, can I have your autograph?

18:04.850 --> 18:06.818
I'd love to.

18:08.654 --> 18:10.554
Kids, there's something I gotta tell you.

18:10.656 --> 18:13.989
Go ahead. Give it to 'em.

18:14.093 --> 18:16.323
<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>Believe it or not, me gettin'pissed...</i>

18:16.428 --> 18:19.761
<i>and throwin'Chaz in the closet was</i>
<i>the best thing that could have happened.</i>

18:30.175 --> 18:33.303
<i>He found a bunch ofboxes</i>
<i>filled with thank-you letters.</i>

18:33.412 --> 18:37.644
<i>There were hundreds ofkids</i>
<i>who looked up to Chaz, just like I had.</i>

18:37.749 --> 18:40.411
<i>Kids who might never grow up</i>
<i>to be astronauts...</i>

18:40.519 --> 18:43.818
<i>but who Chaz had inspired.</i>

18:43.922 --> 18:46.015
<i>Kids who'd learned to love science...</i>

18:46.125 --> 18:48.252
<i>kids who'd learned to love adventure...</i>

18:48.360 --> 18:50.954
<i>kids who'd learned to love</i>
<i>chasin'their dreams.</i>

18:55.267 --> 18:59.101
<i>And one creepy guy from Nathanville</i>
<i>who wanted Chaz to have sex with his wife.</i>

19:00.906 --> 19:03.500
Every kid deserves an autograph
from their hero.

19:03.609 --> 19:05.440
Are you sure?

19:06.812 --> 19:10.976
You're good with people
and with explaining stuff.

19:11.083 --> 19:14.849
And you're fun. Not all astronauts are.

19:16.455 --> 19:18.685
<i>[Earl Narrating] Chaz realized</i>
<i>that the myth of Chaz Dalton...</i>

19:18.790 --> 19:20.758
<i>was more important than the man.</i>

19:20.859 --> 19:23.851
<i>'Cause the myth had inspired</i>
<i>hundreds ofkids, and that was real.</i>

19:23.962 --> 19:26.988
<i>So it worked out the camp</i>
<i>would be both of their legacies.</i>

19:27.099 --> 19:29.533
<i>Wayne Chaz was good</i>
<i>at talkin'about stuff...</i>

19:29.635 --> 19:34.334
<i>and Chaz Chaz had access to all the real stuff,</i>
<i>including another space suit...</i>

19:34.439 --> 19:36.703
<i>which meant I got to cross</i>
<i>Chaz Dalton off my list.</i>

19:36.808 --> 19:40.642
<i>#I'm a rocket man #</i>

19:40.746 --> 19:42.907
- <i># Rocket man #</i>
- <i>It turned out, pretending to be someone else...</i>

19:43.015 --> 19:45.006
<i>could help a lot of different people...</i>

19:45.117 --> 19:50.077
<i>even if it meant staying up all night</i>
<i>making 351 fake profiles on BuddyBook.</i>

19:50.189 --> 19:54.091
- Holden Caulfield, New York.

That's great, baby. I knew you could do it.

20:19.518 --> 20:21.418
