(male announcer)
In the criminal justice system,

00:02.436 --> 00:06.174
sexually based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:06.207 --> 00:09.077
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:09.110 --> 00:10.644
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:10.678 --> 00:12.480
are members
of an elite squad

00:12.513 --> 00:14.082
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:14.115 --> 00:16.684
These are their stories.

00:21.289 --> 00:24.125
[door squeaking open]

00:38.372 --> 00:40.374
[muffled gasp]

00:41.609 --> 00:44.778
Obey me, or die.

00:56.857 --> 00:59.727
Obey me or die.
(woman whimpers)

00:59.760 --> 01:01.329
He put his hand over my mouth.

01:01.362 --> 01:03.197
I woke up and he
was standing over me.

01:03.231 --> 01:04.465
Did you see his face?

01:04.498 --> 01:06.634
No, he was wearing
a ski mask.

01:06.667 --> 01:07.801
Was he tall, short?

01:07.835 --> 01:10.138
Tall and strong.

01:10.171 --> 01:12.773
What about a scent?
Any aftershave or cologne?

01:12.806 --> 01:15.676
Thought I smelled
baby powder.

01:15.709 --> 01:17.345
Did he say anything
to you, Janice?

01:17.378 --> 01:19.880
"Obey me or die."

01:19.913 --> 01:22.483
Third attack this month.

01:22.516 --> 01:24.585
So far.

02:15.803 --> 02:18.672
I'm very careful.
I always lock the door.

02:18.706 --> 02:22.243
He picked the lock.
He knew that you were alone.

02:22.276 --> 02:24.178
Are you saying
he's stalking me?

02:24.212 --> 02:25.946
We think so.

02:25.979 --> 02:30.351
He attacked the other
two women the same way.

02:30.384 --> 02:32.920
We need to figure out
what you all have in common.

02:32.953 --> 02:35.256
Can you walk me through
your daily routine?

02:35.289 --> 02:38.392
[clears throat]
I don't have one.
I'm a hotel developer.

02:38.426 --> 02:39.860
I spend most of my time
on the road.

02:39.893 --> 02:42.330
Okay, when you're in town,
is there a gym that you go to?

02:42.363 --> 02:45.299
Um, Sports Mania.
Mid-town.

02:45.333 --> 02:48.602
I don't go to a gym.
I have a personal trainer.

02:48.636 --> 02:50.438
I'm the firm's only
bankruptcy lawyer,

02:50.471 --> 02:51.772
I don't have time
to work out.

02:51.805 --> 02:53.241
You belong to a church?

02:53.274 --> 02:54.442
(Janice)
No.

02:54.475 --> 02:56.244
Do you volunteer anywhere?

02:56.277 --> 02:57.445
I wish I had time.

02:57.478 --> 03:00.314
Have you applied for a credit
card or a mortgage recently?

03:00.348 --> 03:02.416
No.

03:02.450 --> 03:04.218
Did you fill out any forms
with personal information?

03:04.252 --> 03:05.419
Like, at a doctor's office?

03:05.453 --> 03:07.955
No.

03:07.988 --> 03:10.291
But I did fill out
a questionnaire.

03:10.324 --> 03:12.860
For what?

03:12.893 --> 03:14.295
Speed dating.

03:14.328 --> 03:15.763
Speed dating.

03:15.796 --> 03:17.765
Speed dating.

03:17.798 --> 03:19.867
Invented by a rabbi to match
his students with Jewish mates.

03:19.900 --> 03:22.236
One of people's many
contributions to the world.

03:22.270 --> 03:23.804
Second only to bagels.

03:23.837 --> 03:25.939
[scoffs]
How does it work?

03:25.973 --> 03:27.475
You meet ten women
for three minutes each,

03:27.508 --> 03:28.609
first names only.

03:28.642 --> 03:29.810
You write down
the ones you like.

03:29.843 --> 03:32.346
If the feeling is mutual,
the organizer emails you both.

03:32.380 --> 03:33.847
You sure know
a lot about it.

03:33.881 --> 03:36.417
Well, I went through
a little dating slump.

03:36.450 --> 03:38.586
Called adulthood.

03:38.619 --> 03:39.987
Find any women worth dating?

03:40.020 --> 03:41.789
You'd be surprised.
They have events for all types.

03:41.822 --> 03:43.757
Under 30, over 50.

03:43.791 --> 03:45.359
Straight, gay, professional...

03:45.393 --> 03:47.027
Which allows our perp
to zero in

03:47.060 --> 03:48.762
on successful women
in their 30s.

03:48.796 --> 03:50.531
Just like our victims.

03:50.564 --> 03:52.466
Well, all three
went to speed dating events

03:52.500 --> 03:53.434
hosted by Speed Encounters.

03:53.467 --> 03:55.503
But none of them
went out with the same guy.

03:55.536 --> 03:56.737
We got their names.

03:56.770 --> 03:58.539
Ted Kaye, David Clark,
Peter Lowe.

03:58.572 --> 04:00.374
I don't think our perp
was a date.

04:00.408 --> 04:01.442
(Stabler)
Why not?

04:01.475 --> 04:03.544
Speed Encounters' organizer
used to be a shrink.

04:03.577 --> 04:05.346
Lost his license two years ago.

04:05.379 --> 04:06.647
For what?

04:06.680 --> 04:09.650
Sleeping with his patients.

04:12.353 --> 04:13.787
(man)
It's not what you think.

04:13.821 --> 04:16.290
You had sex with women
you came to you for therapy.

04:16.324 --> 04:17.325
What do you call that?

04:17.358 --> 04:19.293
Exploring new treatments?

04:19.327 --> 04:20.694
With your compass
pointing north.

04:20.728 --> 04:23.364
[sighs]
Look, I learned my lesson, okay?

04:23.397 --> 04:24.398
I lost my practice.

04:24.432 --> 04:27.501
And found an endless supply
of rich, single women.

04:27.535 --> 04:28.669
I didn't rape anyone.

04:28.702 --> 04:31.405
Well, the only link between
those women is you, Jack.

04:31.439 --> 04:33.641
Well, how do you know
it wasn't someone they met here?

04:33.674 --> 04:35.509
They all dated different men.

04:35.543 --> 04:37.044
Maybe not.

04:37.077 --> 04:38.912
A lot of guys don't use their
real name for Speed Dating.

04:38.946 --> 04:42.650
Well, can you find out if a guy
used three different names

04:42.683 --> 04:43.951
to date those women?

04:43.984 --> 04:46.720
I can if he used
the same email address.

04:46.754 --> 04:50.524
[keys clicking]

04:50.558 --> 04:52.560
[computer beeps]

04:52.593 --> 04:54.428
(Jack)
And what do you know.

04:54.462 --> 04:56.497
We get romeo@4umail.com

04:56.530 --> 04:58.699
That's a free service.
Untraceable.

04:58.732 --> 04:59.833
So then I'm off the hook?

04:59.867 --> 05:00.868
(Benson)
No.

05:00.901 --> 05:05.639
Let us know if Romeo
R.S.V.Ps to any other events.

05:05.673 --> 05:07.441
(Stabler)
Ted, David, and Peter's
our Romeo.

05:07.475 --> 05:09.610
So what else do you
remember about the date?

05:09.643 --> 05:10.844
He paid for everything.

05:10.878 --> 05:12.413
He opened the door for me.

05:12.446 --> 05:13.947
He actually listened
to what I said.

05:13.981 --> 05:15.516
(Stabler)
Sounds like a nice guy.

05:15.549 --> 05:18.486
But you all turned him down
for a second date. Why?

05:18.519 --> 05:19.487
He insisted
on ordering for me.

05:19.520 --> 05:21.088
He was a control freak.

05:21.121 --> 05:22.423
(Janice)
Me too.

05:22.456 --> 05:24.392
Even though I told him
I hated sushi.

05:24.425 --> 05:25.659
So how did he take that?

05:25.693 --> 05:28.028
He said he knew I'd like it
if I tried it.

05:28.061 --> 05:29.597
Different names,
the same guy.

05:29.630 --> 05:31.131
And they're all
the same kind of woman.

05:31.164 --> 05:33.434
Smart, powerful, accomplished.

05:33.467 --> 05:35.603
But when they won't go out
with him a second time,

05:35.636 --> 05:36.870
he becomes enraged.

05:36.904 --> 05:39.106
These rapes are about revenge.

05:39.139 --> 05:40.508
He 's a narcissist.

05:40.541 --> 05:42.510
He's trying to repair
his wounded ego.

05:42.543 --> 05:44.512
What's your profile?

05:44.545 --> 05:46.414
He's detail oriented.

05:46.447 --> 05:49.116
Precise.
He takes pride in his work.

05:49.149 --> 05:50.784
He plans every attack
like a mission.

05:50.818 --> 05:51.719
Ex-military?

05:51.752 --> 05:53.554
He could be, he's disciplined
and organized.

05:53.587 --> 05:55.055
And meticulous.

05:55.088 --> 05:57.658
He hasn't left DNA,
fingerprints or a single fiber.

05:57.691 --> 05:59.427
Just the scent of baby powder.

05:59.460 --> 06:00.794
He's perfected his technique.

06:00.828 --> 06:03.431
I doubt that any of these women
were his first victims.

06:03.464 --> 06:06.099
What he's really aroused by
is the total control.

06:06.133 --> 06:07.968
Not the killing.

06:08.001 --> 06:09.803
The guy from
Speed Encounters called.

06:09.837 --> 06:12.806
"Romeo" just signed up
for tonight's event.

06:12.840 --> 06:16.644
He's looking for a new Juliet.

06:21.449 --> 06:22.750
I love cats.

06:22.783 --> 06:24.552
I'm a dog person.

06:24.585 --> 06:26.854
It was like I was
outside my body watching.

06:26.887 --> 06:28.789
You know what I mean?
Yeah.

06:28.822 --> 06:31.058
I felt the same way
when I was abducted.

06:31.091 --> 06:33.827
Ten second warning, folks.
Wrap it up.

06:33.861 --> 06:36.029
Collecting PEZ dispensers
sounds like a very

06:36.063 --> 06:38.766
interesting hobby.

06:38.799 --> 06:40.133
And time's up, folks.

06:40.167 --> 06:41.935
Gentlemen, please move
one seat to your left.

06:41.969 --> 06:43.771
Okay, thank you.

06:45.639 --> 06:48.141
Hi.

06:48.175 --> 06:49.610
Hi.

06:49.643 --> 06:50.678
I'm Jim.

06:50.711 --> 06:52.513
Rachel.

06:52.546 --> 06:54.014
Rachel.

06:54.047 --> 06:58.786
Well, you are the most beautiful
woman in the room.

06:58.819 --> 07:00.087
[laughs]
Thank you.

07:00.120 --> 07:02.490
You don't waste
any time, do you?

07:02.523 --> 07:04.224
Just being honest.

07:04.257 --> 07:06.994
I can't believe that you
need help finding a date.

07:07.027 --> 07:09.229
I'm in advertising.

07:09.262 --> 07:10.764
And, uh, the only men
that I meet

07:10.798 --> 07:12.533
are either colleagues,
or clients,

07:12.566 --> 07:14.868
and I don't like to mix
business with pleasure.

07:14.902 --> 07:16.770
Ah, well, I'm on Wall Street.

07:16.804 --> 07:20.574
So my business will not
interfere with our pleasure.

07:20.608 --> 07:22.776
[both chuckle]

07:25.679 --> 07:27.481
Any word?

07:27.515 --> 07:28.582
Not yet.

07:28.616 --> 07:30.651
Well, maybe you're
not his type.

07:30.684 --> 07:34.688
Oh, no, he was interested.

07:34.722 --> 07:37.591
I could feel it, you know?

07:37.625 --> 07:39.860
Yeah.

07:39.893 --> 07:42.630
Think he's our perp?

07:42.663 --> 07:45.599
I couldn't get
a read on him.

07:45.633 --> 07:47.668
Normally, I need two minutes
in the box with a guy

07:47.701 --> 07:49.637
then I know if he's guilty,
but...

07:49.670 --> 07:50.771
[new email chime]

07:50.804 --> 07:52.139
(Stabler)
Email?

07:53.574 --> 07:56.610
(Benson)
I've got a match.

07:56.644 --> 07:58.912
Romeo?

07:58.946 --> 08:01.615
He wants
to buy Rachel a drink.

08:01.649 --> 08:05.085
(Mike)
I can't remember the last time
I met a woman who had

08:05.118 --> 08:08.121
brains, beauty,
and a successful career.

08:08.155 --> 08:11.592
Wow, it's nice to meet a man
who appreciates all three.

08:11.625 --> 08:15.929
I do.
Thank you.

08:15.963 --> 08:18.231
Ah, that's better.

08:18.265 --> 08:20.934
Would you like
another drink?

08:20.968 --> 08:23.604
Um, sure, I'll have another
glass of cabernet.

08:23.637 --> 08:25.072
No, no, she doesn't
want that.

08:25.105 --> 08:28.308
She'll have a vodka martini,
dirty with extra olives.

08:28.341 --> 08:29.777
Oh, I don't drink vodka.

08:29.810 --> 08:31.311
I think I'll stick
with the wine, thanks.

08:31.344 --> 08:33.581
Trust me, you'll love it.

08:33.614 --> 08:36.049
Would you get the lady
her vodka martini, please?

08:36.083 --> 08:39.119
Thank you.

08:39.152 --> 08:41.154
So how many times
have you tried Speed Dating?

08:41.188 --> 08:43.657
You are my first.

08:43.691 --> 08:45.292
Wow.
What about you?

08:45.325 --> 08:46.660
I just got back
on the market.

08:46.694 --> 08:49.329
Long term relationship?
A year.

08:49.362 --> 08:52.766
But I knew two months into it
that she wasn't for me.

08:52.800 --> 08:56.670
Too clingy. Insecure.

08:56.704 --> 08:58.972
Well, you kept seeing her.
Had to be something you liked.

08:59.006 --> 09:00.608
She was a good cook.

09:00.641 --> 09:03.110
She kept the apartment
spotless.

09:03.143 --> 09:07.314
We didn't have any
common interests.

09:07.347 --> 09:09.282
You're looking
for an equal.

09:09.316 --> 09:11.652
Exactly.

09:11.685 --> 09:15.088
I need a woman who knows what
she wants, and how to get it.

09:15.122 --> 09:19.226
What are you thinking
right now?

09:22.229 --> 09:24.898
I'm thinking that it's late.

09:24.932 --> 09:28.902
And I've got
a long day tomorrow.

09:28.936 --> 09:30.704
Rachel, please stay.

09:30.738 --> 09:31.772
Thanks for the drink.

09:31.805 --> 09:33.741
Good night.

10:06.006 --> 10:07.808
(Mike)
What's going on?

10:07.841 --> 10:09.242
We're arresting you
for rape.

10:09.276 --> 10:11.812
Three counts.
What?

10:12.746 --> 10:14.848
I didn't rape anyone.

10:14.882 --> 10:16.950
I'm a surgeon.
I save lives every day.

10:16.984 --> 10:18.819
Big man in the O.R.

10:18.852 --> 10:22.422
My skills are
well respected.
Mmm, like in bed?

10:22.455 --> 10:24.124
I hear you get
turned down a lot.

10:24.157 --> 10:26.927
[scoffs]
You got me mixed up
with somebody else.

10:26.960 --> 10:30.430
Yeah, with Ted,
David, Peter--

10:30.463 --> 10:31.932
(Benson)
And Jim.

10:33.300 --> 10:35.669
Rachel?

10:35.703 --> 10:37.838
It's Detective Benson.

10:37.871 --> 10:40.373
(Stabler)
This is Mike Jergens.
He's a surgeon.

10:40.407 --> 10:42.075
Why'd you lie?

10:42.109 --> 10:46.146
A lot of women hear doctor,
and they see dollar signs.

10:46.179 --> 10:47.981
I was just protecting myself.

10:48.015 --> 10:49.883
Then why'd you follow me home?

10:49.917 --> 10:51.018
I just wanted
to apologize to you.

10:51.051 --> 10:52.686
You wanted to know
where she lived,

10:52.720 --> 10:54.154
so you can go back
and rape her.

10:54.187 --> 10:56.724
You got the wrong guy.
Mm-mm.

10:56.757 --> 10:58.158
You meet a girl, you date her,

10:58.191 --> 10:59.793
then you act like
a control freak.

10:59.827 --> 11:02.129
She turns you down,
you stalk her,

11:02.162 --> 11:05.165
and you sneak back later
to rape her.

11:05.198 --> 11:06.867
Guys like you are compulsive.

11:06.900 --> 11:08.135
You follow the same
script every time.

11:08.168 --> 11:10.871
Just like you raped
Janice Clay Tuesday night.

11:10.904 --> 11:13.106
You are crazy.
I'm crazy?

11:13.140 --> 11:14.474
(Grahame-Bishop)
Don't say another word.

11:14.507 --> 11:16.744
Minerva Grahame-Bishop.

11:16.777 --> 11:18.812
I represent Dr. Jergens.

11:18.846 --> 11:21.014
Come on.
They won't bite.

11:21.048 --> 11:22.215
Who's this?

11:22.249 --> 11:23.951
Hi.

11:23.984 --> 11:26.086
[sighs]

11:26.119 --> 11:29.389
This is my girlfriend.
Cora Kennison.

11:29.422 --> 11:31.291
(Benson)
Your girlfriend?

11:31.324 --> 11:33.060
Thought you were single?

11:33.093 --> 11:36.063
No, Mike and I have
been living together for a year.

11:38.331 --> 11:40.100
Tell the detectives
what you told me.

11:43.470 --> 11:46.273
It's all right, Darling.
Tell them.

11:46.306 --> 11:49.109
Tell them where I was
Tuesday night.

11:49.142 --> 11:51.478
We were home.

11:51.511 --> 11:54.047
All night?
Mike never left?

11:54.081 --> 11:57.417
No, he was right
next to me in bed.

12:07.060 --> 12:09.196
Mike spent half our date
bad-mouthing Cora.

12:09.229 --> 12:11.331
He doesn't love her,
he just needs an alibi.

12:11.364 --> 12:14.802
Which will hold up without any
physical evidence against him.

12:14.835 --> 12:17.437
No evidence?
All three victims ID'd him.

12:17.470 --> 12:19.940
Yeah, as a man they dated.
Not as their masked rapist.

12:19.973 --> 12:22.943
Mike went out with three women.
All three women were attacked.

12:22.976 --> 12:24.945
That's a clear pattern
admissible in court.

12:24.978 --> 12:26.279
Yeah, but it's still
circumstantial.

12:26.313 --> 12:28.281
It's not enough to convict.

12:28.315 --> 12:30.483
You should've waited for him
to attack Olivia.

12:30.517 --> 12:32.219
The women were raped
weeks after they dated Mike.

12:32.252 --> 12:33.553
We couldn't wait.

12:33.586 --> 12:37.024
And I can't indict.
Cut him loose.

12:37.057 --> 12:38.425
He's gonna do it again.

12:38.458 --> 12:41.528
Then break his alibi.

12:43.030 --> 12:45.565
I'll take a run at Cora.

12:45.598 --> 12:48.802
I did date her boyfriend.

12:52.305 --> 12:55.308
Mike's at the hospital.

12:55.342 --> 12:56.576
Well actually,
I came to see you.

12:56.609 --> 12:58.578
He said not to let
the police inside.

12:58.611 --> 13:01.214
Well, we could go
someplace else to talk.

13:01.248 --> 13:02.415
No, I better not.

13:02.449 --> 13:03.851
Cora, wait, just--

13:03.884 --> 13:06.920
There's something
that you need to know.

13:06.954 --> 13:09.022
Mike said that you'd
try to trick me.

13:09.056 --> 13:12.025
Did he also say
that we went on a date?

13:16.096 --> 13:17.297
You're lying.

13:22.369 --> 13:24.371
Another detective
took photos.

13:27.174 --> 13:29.943
Well, there must be
some explanation.

13:29.977 --> 13:32.946
There's a coffee shop
around the corner.

13:34.014 --> 13:36.116
(Benson)
How did you and Mike meet?

13:36.149 --> 13:39.419
My last boyfriend
beat me up.

13:39.452 --> 13:44.091
I went to the E.R.
Mike took care of me.

13:44.124 --> 13:45.926
When did you two
start dating?

13:45.959 --> 13:47.294
Last year.

13:47.327 --> 13:50.163
A guy like that...

13:52.665 --> 13:55.135
I couldn't believe
he was interested in me.

13:57.104 --> 14:00.140
Does he ever ask you
to, you know,

14:00.173 --> 14:03.276
do things in the bedroom
that you don't wanna do?

14:05.078 --> 14:08.181
[laughs]

14:08.215 --> 14:11.018
There's nothing
I wouldn't do for Mike.

14:11.051 --> 14:14.888
I love him.
He loves me.

14:14.922 --> 14:17.557
Then why does he
date other women?

14:17.590 --> 14:21.061
I'm not as smart as Mike.

14:21.094 --> 14:24.431
I didn't go to college.

14:26.333 --> 14:29.069
Sometimes he just needs
other people to talk to.

14:29.102 --> 14:33.573
But he always comes home.
That's what matters.

14:33.606 --> 14:36.476
Cora, Mike told me
things about you.

14:36.509 --> 14:40.981
Like what?

14:44.584 --> 14:47.620
(Mike on tape)
But I knew two months into it,
that she wasn't for me.

14:47.654 --> 14:50.190
Too clingy. Insecure.

14:50.223 --> 14:53.226
(Benson on tape)
But you kept seeing her.
You had to like something.

14:53.260 --> 14:54.694
(Mike on tape)
She was a good cook.

14:54.727 --> 14:57.297
She kept
the apartment spotless.

14:57.330 --> 15:01.201
We didn't have any
common interests.

15:01.234 --> 15:03.070
[recorder switched off]

15:03.103 --> 15:06.039
You take really
good care of him.

15:06.073 --> 15:10.077
And he's making you
cover up the truth.

15:14.447 --> 15:19.419
Cora, did he ask you
to lie for him?

15:26.659 --> 15:30.330
Yeah.

15:34.734 --> 15:36.703
Was he home
on Tuesday night?

15:36.736 --> 15:40.340
I'm gonna be sick.

15:45.045 --> 15:47.380
Did Mike
take anything with him

15:47.414 --> 15:50.450
when he left
the house that night?

15:53.353 --> 15:55.322
His gym bag.

15:55.355 --> 15:58.358
Thought he was
gonna work out.

15:58.391 --> 16:00.493
We're gonna need to find
that bag, Cora.

16:00.527 --> 16:03.196
I need your permission
to search the apartment.

16:03.230 --> 16:06.066
Look, I know Mike's a good man.

16:06.099 --> 16:07.300
Cora...

16:07.334 --> 16:11.371
he raped three women.

16:14.407 --> 16:17.144
I don't believe you.

16:17.177 --> 16:21.314
If Mike is innocent,
then he's got nothing to hide.

16:21.348 --> 16:26.219
So give us your consent
to search the apartment.

16:38.498 --> 16:42.169
Well, well, well.
Latex gloves.

16:42.202 --> 16:44.404
Surgical tools.

16:44.437 --> 16:46.673
Pair of magnifying glasses.

16:46.706 --> 16:49.076
I could pick any lock
with that stuff.

16:49.109 --> 16:51.244
And here's our baby powder.

16:51.278 --> 16:53.280
Mike's a doctor, he knows it'll
stop him from sweating,

16:53.313 --> 16:55.248
leaving DNA.

16:55.282 --> 16:56.583
He's a smart cat.
Why's he out raping?

16:56.616 --> 16:58.051
He's got money, good looks,

16:58.085 --> 16:59.752
a woman waiting on him
when he gets home.

16:59.786 --> 17:01.588
Attacking women's his way
of venting anger.

17:01.621 --> 17:04.524
What the hell
are you doing here?

17:04.557 --> 17:07.094
Arresting you again.

17:07.127 --> 17:09.529
You have the right
to remain silent.

17:09.562 --> 17:11.798
Anything you say can
and will be used against you

17:11.831 --> 17:13.733
in a court of law.

17:13.766 --> 17:15.668
You sure you don't wanna
wait for a ride?

17:15.702 --> 17:18.171
No, I'm fine by myself.

17:18.205 --> 17:19.839
Cora, my cell phone number's
on the back.

17:19.872 --> 17:23.410
I want you to call me
if you need anything.

17:24.477 --> 17:26.246
Mike--

17:26.279 --> 17:27.447
Sweetheart, I told you
not to talk to them.

17:27.480 --> 17:28.648
I'm so sorry.
Cora.

17:28.681 --> 17:30.517
It's not your fault, honey,
Not your fault.

17:30.550 --> 17:32.085
Don't worry about it, okay?
We're gonna be together soon.

17:32.119 --> 17:33.553
Don't bet on that.

17:33.586 --> 17:35.455
Found his goodie-bag.
Lock picks and baby powder.

17:35.488 --> 17:38.491
I don't understand.
Cora.

17:38.525 --> 17:40.427
Honey, I love you, okay?
Remember that.

17:40.460 --> 17:41.628
I can explain everything.

17:41.661 --> 17:45.565
Cora, don't listen to him.

17:48.568 --> 17:50.737
(Judge Donnelly)
What is the basis
of your motion, Minerva?

17:50.770 --> 17:52.539
Cora had no right
to consent to a search,

17:52.572 --> 17:53.473
since it isn't her apartment.

17:53.506 --> 17:54.674
Precedent's clear.

17:54.707 --> 17:56.376
A live-in girlfriend,

17:56.409 --> 17:58.711
a roommate can consent
to a search of a common areas,

17:58.745 --> 18:00.313
and that's where
we found the bag.

18:00.347 --> 18:01.781
Except she doesn't live there.

18:01.814 --> 18:03.383
This is the lease
to Cora's apartment.

18:03.416 --> 18:04.551
That's her legal residence.

18:04.584 --> 18:07.254
This is where she gets her
mail, and is registered to vote

18:07.287 --> 18:08.321
and pays her taxes.

18:08.355 --> 18:10.723
She is merely an overnight
guest at my client's,

18:10.757 --> 18:13.693
and therefore has no standing
to authorize a search.

18:13.726 --> 18:15.328
Were your detectives
aware of this, Casey?

18:15.362 --> 18:16.696
Absolutely not.

18:16.729 --> 18:18.431
I don't need to play
fast and loose.

18:18.465 --> 18:19.599
And regardless
of Ms. Bishop's motion,

18:19.632 --> 18:20.900
the evidence should be allowed.

18:20.933 --> 18:23.703
Under what theory?

18:23.736 --> 18:25.305
Inevitable discovery.

18:25.338 --> 18:26.739
The defendant is our
prime suspect.

18:26.773 --> 18:29.542
We had grounds for a warrant.
We would have found it anyway.

18:29.576 --> 18:31.444
Found what?
My client is a doctor.

18:31.478 --> 18:33.880
Those were surgical instruments
in that gym bag, not lock picks.

18:33.913 --> 18:36.249
Mike Jergens is too smart
to risk arrest

18:36.283 --> 18:37.550
carrying around
burglar's tools,

18:37.584 --> 18:38.851
so he used
a legal alternative.

18:38.885 --> 18:40.587
The victims all
describe a ski mask.

18:40.620 --> 18:41.788
Where is it?

18:41.821 --> 18:44.457
Not recovered,
but we did find baby powder.

18:44.491 --> 18:46.726
My client is a surgeon.
He scrubs his hands constantly.

18:46.759 --> 18:48.628
Baby powder is used
to soothe the skin.

18:48.661 --> 18:50.797
You can't take this seriously.

18:50.830 --> 18:52.665
I take the constitution
seriously.

18:52.699 --> 18:54.267
The search is out.

18:54.301 --> 18:56.636
Your Honor, the gym bag
is the people's only evidence

18:56.669 --> 18:58.271
against my client.

18:58.305 --> 19:00.240
I move for a dismissal
of the rape charges.

19:00.273 --> 19:02.342
(Judge Donnelly)
I'll leave that
to the Grand Jury.

19:02.375 --> 19:05.345
You have 72 hours to get
an indictment,

19:05.378 --> 19:07.880
or Dr. Jergens walks.

19:07.914 --> 19:10.517
What now?
(Novak)
We start over
with fresh evidence.

19:10.550 --> 19:13.586
So I got new warrants
for Jergens' house,

19:13.620 --> 19:15.255
hospital locker, and car.

19:15.288 --> 19:16.623
Find that ski mask.

19:16.656 --> 19:18.891
This guy is no dummy.
That mask is long gone.

19:18.925 --> 19:20.627
Yeah, so prove
that he bought one.

19:20.660 --> 19:22.562
Check his financials
for purchases.

19:22.595 --> 19:25.498
Oh, Olivia, see, I'm gonna
need your help with Cora.

19:25.532 --> 19:26.799
She's gotta testify.

19:26.833 --> 19:29.569
Oh, I don't think
she can handle it.

19:29.602 --> 19:31.938
She already feels guilty
about turning Mike in.

19:31.971 --> 19:34.441
We need Cora.
You gotta convince her to do it.

19:36.776 --> 19:38.278
When?

19:38.311 --> 19:40.547
Tomorrow. She's my first witness
in the Grand Jury.

19:40.580 --> 19:44.851
I'll break the news.

19:44.884 --> 19:47.720
Cora?

19:52.859 --> 19:54.827
Cora?

19:54.861 --> 19:58.865
It's Detective Benson.

20:05.905 --> 20:08.575
Cora?

20:10.477 --> 20:14.447
Cora?
Cora!

20:14.481 --> 20:18.685
Cora, wake up.
Wake up.

20:18.718 --> 20:20.720
[sighs]

20:22.855 --> 20:24.724
SVU portable to central.

20:24.757 --> 20:26.526
I've got a woman who's
unconscious.

20:26.559 --> 20:29.496
I need a bus.
390 W. 23rd Street.

20:29.529 --> 20:31.998
Cora?
Cora, wake up.

20:32.031 --> 20:33.800
Wake up.

20:37.637 --> 20:41.274
Cora's Blood Alcohol
was .35.

20:41.308 --> 20:42.409
She's lucky she didn't die.

20:42.442 --> 20:43.910
Will she be all right?

20:43.943 --> 20:45.312
For the time being.

20:45.345 --> 20:47.480
But her hematocrit
showed macrocytosis,

20:47.514 --> 20:49.416
and impaired liver function.

20:49.449 --> 20:51.651
The signs of chronic
alcohol abuse.

20:51.684 --> 20:53.453
How could somebody so young

20:53.486 --> 20:54.821
have done so much damage?

20:54.854 --> 20:56.389
Binge drinking.

20:56.423 --> 20:58.024
You're seeing it more and more
in young people.

20:58.057 --> 20:59.826
They don't drink every day,
but then they'll down

20:59.859 --> 21:01.394
five or six
cocktails in an hour.

21:01.428 --> 21:03.696
So your diagnosis
is alcohol poisoning?

21:03.730 --> 21:05.898
Yes, but that's not
her only problem.

21:05.932 --> 21:07.434
I found scarring
on her knuckles,

21:07.467 --> 21:09.336
damage to her tooth enamel.

21:09.369 --> 21:10.503
She's bulimic.

21:10.537 --> 21:12.372
Yeah, I'd say
for quite some time.

21:12.405 --> 21:13.773
Look, she should be in rehab.

21:13.806 --> 21:15.508
Can you admit her?

21:15.542 --> 21:17.644
I can keep her overnight
to adjust her electrolytes.

21:17.677 --> 21:19.512
But we just don't have
the long-term

21:19.546 --> 21:22.549
treatment program she needs.

21:22.582 --> 21:24.717
How you feeling?

21:24.751 --> 21:27.487
[scoffs]

21:27.520 --> 21:29.722
Okay, I guess.

21:29.756 --> 21:31.558
The doctor says
that you're pretty sick.

21:31.591 --> 21:35.562
I don't drink
all the time.

21:35.595 --> 21:37.430
I never blacked out before.

21:39.732 --> 21:41.468
I was just
so upset about Mike.

21:41.501 --> 21:43.403
I understand.

21:43.436 --> 21:47.674
But, if you don't stop drinking,

21:47.707 --> 21:50.810
and bingeing and puking,

21:50.843 --> 21:52.512
you could die.

21:52.545 --> 21:57.049
You can't hide it
anymore, Cora.

21:57.083 --> 21:59.552
Mike knew about my problems.

21:59.586 --> 22:02.922
He was trying to help me.

22:02.955 --> 22:06.726
Now I got no one.

22:06.759 --> 22:08.928
If I get you into a program,

22:08.961 --> 22:10.630
will you go?

22:10.663 --> 22:13.600
Yes.
[knock on door]

22:13.633 --> 22:17.537
Cora.

22:23.009 --> 22:24.777
Thank God you're all right.

22:24.811 --> 22:27.447
Mom, what are you doing here?

22:27.480 --> 22:29.882
The hospital called, so I've
come to take you home.

22:29.916 --> 22:33.620
Actually, Cora's just agreed
to go to rehab.

22:33.653 --> 22:35.822
I'm sorry, who are you?

22:35.855 --> 22:38.625
I'm Detective Benson,
Special Victims Unit.

22:38.658 --> 22:41.060
What did Mike do to you?
Nothing.

22:41.093 --> 22:42.495
(Kennison)
Then why are
the police here?

22:42.529 --> 22:44.531
(Benson)
Mrs. Kennison,

22:44.564 --> 22:45.865
Mike Jergens raped three women.

22:45.898 --> 22:48.167
Cora has to testify against him.

22:48.200 --> 22:51.137
Oh, that man is poison.

22:51.170 --> 22:54.073
Cora, he is why you're drinking.

22:54.106 --> 22:56.643
(Kennison)
Now I don't want you
seeing him again.

22:56.676 --> 22:59.512
We'll go back
to Wilmington tonight.

22:59.546 --> 23:03.616
(Benson)
Actually, Cora can't leave.

23:03.650 --> 23:05.918
She's going to be a witness
in the Grand Jury tomorrow.

23:11.491 --> 23:13.626
Morning.
Novak call yet?

23:13.660 --> 23:15.662
Ten minutes ago,
Grand Jury indicted

23:15.695 --> 23:17.063
Mike for all three rapes.

23:17.096 --> 23:18.698
Oh, good.

23:18.731 --> 23:20.700
Well, don't look so happy.

23:20.733 --> 23:23.102
I'm worried about Cora.

23:23.135 --> 23:25.605
She had a rough time
facing the Grand Jury.

23:25.638 --> 23:28.675
And she still has to testify
against Mike at trial.

23:28.708 --> 23:29.809
She's really fragile.

23:29.842 --> 23:31.611
Well, that's why you
got her into rehab.

23:31.644 --> 23:33.480
(Benson)
Oh, no, the mother
won't let her go.

23:33.513 --> 23:36.215
Virginia says that she can take
care of Cora all by herself.

23:36.248 --> 23:38.685
Love never cured
an alcoholic.

23:39.852 --> 23:41.087
(Benson)
Mrs. Kennison?

23:41.120 --> 23:42.522
She's gone.

23:42.555 --> 23:44.023
Cora?

23:44.056 --> 23:45.692
We were at Penn Station

23:45.725 --> 23:48.027
waiting for the trains,
and she just disappeared.

23:48.060 --> 23:49.529
This is all my fault.

23:49.562 --> 23:51.664
I should never had
let her out of my sight.

23:51.698 --> 23:52.732
Calm down. What happened?

23:52.765 --> 23:53.833
She went to the bathroom.

23:53.866 --> 23:55.468
And she was in there
a long time.

23:55.502 --> 23:57.236
I thought she might
be throwing up, and I went in.

23:57.269 --> 23:58.170
She's gone.

23:58.204 --> 24:00.139
Do you have any idea
where she could be?

24:00.172 --> 24:03.075
To see Mike.

24:03.109 --> 24:05.645
She's probably at Rikers.

24:05.678 --> 24:09.148
Let's go.
All she could talk about
was saying good-bye.

24:09.181 --> 24:10.850
Mike Jergens is on
a visit right now.

24:10.883 --> 24:13.653
With Cora Kennison?
Don't know.

24:14.787 --> 24:16.923
What, is he seeing a priest?

24:16.956 --> 24:19.492
Guess so.

24:22.629 --> 24:24.964
Cora.

24:24.997 --> 24:26.799
We're married.

24:26.833 --> 24:28.034
You son of a bitch.

24:28.067 --> 24:29.636
Please, you're
in God's house.

24:29.669 --> 24:31.704
Yeah, I bet you proposed
when you saw Cora's name

24:31.738 --> 24:32.939
on the witness list.

24:32.972 --> 24:34.974
This isn't going to stop her
from testifying at your trial.

24:35.007 --> 24:37.076
Yes, it is. You can't make me,
I'm his wife now.

24:37.109 --> 24:38.077
There's no spousal
privilege here.

24:38.110 --> 24:40.079
These rapes were committed
before this wedding.

24:40.112 --> 24:41.881
That's not the reason
I married her.

24:41.914 --> 24:43.716
Right, officer, take him
back to his cell.

24:43.750 --> 24:45.985
I'll come visit you tomorrow.
Okay.
I love you, Cora, okay?

24:46.018 --> 24:48.220
Nothing can change that.

24:48.254 --> 24:52.592
Cora, you're mother's very
worried about you.

24:52.625 --> 24:54.594
Mike needs me.
What about rehab?

24:54.627 --> 24:55.928
My husband will help me.

24:55.962 --> 24:57.997
He's never helped you before.

24:58.030 --> 25:00.299
He only lets you drink
so he can control you.

25:00.332 --> 25:01.734
He loves me.

25:01.768 --> 25:03.102
That's why he married me.

25:03.135 --> 25:05.004
Cora, he married you
to shut you up.

25:05.037 --> 25:07.840
Don't you know
that he's using you?

25:07.874 --> 25:10.176
You are the one
that's using me.

25:10.209 --> 25:13.746
Pretending to be my friend
so that you can frame him.

25:13.780 --> 25:15.314
Mike swore to me.

25:15.347 --> 25:16.716
He never raped anyone.

25:16.749 --> 25:18.585
Mike's fingerprints
were on his rape kit.

25:18.618 --> 25:19.652
Well, you planted them.

25:19.686 --> 25:21.654
It was found in his gym bag.

25:21.688 --> 25:23.089
You told us where to look.
Stop it.

25:23.122 --> 25:24.624
He left your bed
to rape three women.

25:24.657 --> 25:27.627
Shut up!

25:32.665 --> 25:36.302
Cora, listen to me.

25:36.335 --> 25:40.873
I know that you know
in your heart that he's guilty.

25:40.907 --> 25:44.644
I don't want him to be.

25:44.677 --> 25:46.879
I know how hard this is--

25:46.913 --> 25:49.148
[gasps]

25:49.181 --> 25:52.218
You have to testify.
[sniffles]

25:54.921 --> 25:58.858
You want me to send
my husband to prison?

25:58.891 --> 26:01.761
I want you to tell the truth.

26:01.794 --> 26:04.831
[sniffles]

26:10.937 --> 26:12.872
(Novak)
In your initial statement
to the police,

26:12.905 --> 26:14.641
you said that Mike
was home with you

26:14.674 --> 26:16.008
on the nights
of the three rapes.

26:16.042 --> 26:17.977
Yes.

26:18.010 --> 26:20.379
Is that true?
No.

26:20.412 --> 26:21.914
Why did you lie?

26:21.948 --> 26:24.050
(Cora)
Because Mike told me to.

26:24.083 --> 26:25.818
Do you know where he went?

26:25.852 --> 26:26.986
No.

26:27.019 --> 26:29.822
He didn't tell me,
I didn't ask.

26:29.856 --> 26:33.225
Thank you.

26:33.259 --> 26:36.195
[sighs]
Cora, you married Mike Jergens

26:36.228 --> 26:38.798
after he was accused
of sexual assault.

26:38.831 --> 26:40.032
(Cora)
Yes.

26:40.066 --> 26:42.101
I love him.

26:42.134 --> 26:45.237
(Grahame-Bishop)
Do you believe your
husband is a rapist?

26:45.271 --> 26:48.875
I don't know.

26:48.908 --> 26:51.711
Was he ever violent with you?

26:51.744 --> 26:53.145
No.

26:53.179 --> 26:56.248
In fact, he saved you
from an abusive relationship.

26:56.282 --> 26:57.316
Yes.

26:57.349 --> 26:59.051
Did he ever rape you?

26:59.085 --> 27:00.887
No, Mike would never hurt me.

27:00.920 --> 27:02.722
(Grahame-Bishop)
Cora, why are you here today?

27:02.755 --> 27:05.224
They told me
that I have to testify.

27:05.257 --> 27:07.727
And by they you mean,
Detective Benson

27:07.760 --> 27:09.328
and A.D.A. Novak?

27:09.361 --> 27:11.130
(Cora)
Yes, they said I don't
have a choice.

27:11.163 --> 27:14.166
And they said that Mike
raped those women.

27:14.200 --> 27:16.035
But you don't believe that.

27:16.068 --> 27:17.236
You love him.
You married him.

27:17.269 --> 27:19.305
You think he's innocent.
Yes.

27:19.338 --> 27:20.272
Objection.

27:20.306 --> 27:21.607
Why are you doing this
to the man you love?

27:21.640 --> 27:24.010
(Novak)
Objection, Your Honor,
she's leading the witness.

27:24.043 --> 27:25.311
(Judge Donnelly bangs gavel)
Sustained.

27:27.747 --> 27:29.882
Would you like
to take a break, Ms. Kennison?

27:29.916 --> 27:33.185
Please.
We're in recess
until tomorrow.

27:33.219 --> 27:35.354
[bangs gavel]

27:51.470 --> 27:54.206
I'm sorry.

27:54.240 --> 27:57.176
It's okay, sweetheart.

27:57.209 --> 27:59.045
I love you, okay?

28:04.483 --> 28:09.288
[phone ringing]

28:11.157 --> 28:13.092
Hello?

28:13.125 --> 28:17.229
Cora?

28:17.263 --> 28:21.167
Shh. Hold on.
When did Mike call you?

28:21.200 --> 28:24.871
What did he say?

28:24.904 --> 28:28.274
Cora, Cora, how much have
you had to drink?

28:28.307 --> 28:31.811
Okay, shh,
Cora, calm down.

28:31.844 --> 28:34.246
I'm on my way.

28:34.280 --> 28:36.883
[sighs]

28:38.417 --> 28:41.453
[dialing]

28:43.489 --> 28:46.759
Elliot, it's me.
Send a bus over to Cora's.

28:46.793 --> 28:47.994
And call Rikers and have

28:48.027 --> 28:49.762
Mike Jergens put
on suicide watch.

28:49.796 --> 28:52.098
Thanks.

28:52.131 --> 28:55.968
[police sirens]

28:58.905 --> 29:01.307
Hey!
How drunk is she?

29:01.340 --> 29:03.876
I did C.P.R.
until E.M.S. got here.

29:03.910 --> 29:05.912
C.P.R.?
What the hell happened?

29:05.945 --> 29:08.447
Hey, what's going on?

29:08.480 --> 29:10.349
Her sats are dropping.
Respiratory arrest.

29:10.382 --> 29:12.819
I just talked to her.
(male E.M.T.)
We need to intubate.

29:12.852 --> 29:14.420
(female E.M.T.)
She's bradying down.

29:14.453 --> 29:15.387
We're losing her.

29:15.421 --> 29:17.990
Tube's in.

29:20.126 --> 29:21.994
(female E.M.T.)
We got a pulse.

29:22.028 --> 29:23.295
Sats are rising.

29:23.329 --> 29:24.463
(female E.M.T.)
Let's go!

29:36.375 --> 29:40.079
Cora's heart is still beating,

29:40.112 --> 29:44.216
but her brain was deprived
of oxygen too long.

29:44.250 --> 29:46.118
Will she recover?

29:46.152 --> 29:49.922
No. Her EEG shows signs
of irreversible brain injury.

29:49.956 --> 29:52.191
But she's awake,
her eyes are still moving.

29:52.224 --> 29:53.860
That's only a brain stem reflex.

29:53.893 --> 29:55.928
She can't see us.

29:55.962 --> 30:00.366
She doesn't follow commands
or respond to pain.

30:00.399 --> 30:02.301
How did this happen?

30:02.334 --> 30:04.170
She probably had
four or five drinks.

30:04.203 --> 30:08.040
But Cora's system was weakened
by her bulimia.

30:08.074 --> 30:10.309
It doubled the impact
of the alcohol.

30:10.342 --> 30:13.045
Okay, well, when will
she get better?

30:13.079 --> 30:17.149
Mrs. Kennison, Cora's
not going to get better.

30:23.956 --> 30:26.893
Is there anything
that you can do for her?

30:26.926 --> 30:28.895
We'll continue to provide
supportive care

30:28.928 --> 30:30.229
and keep her comfortable.

30:30.262 --> 30:33.165
In other words,
not a damn thing!

30:33.199 --> 30:34.934
I'm sorry, Mrs. Kennison.

30:34.967 --> 30:37.904
She drank because you
made her testify.

30:37.937 --> 30:41.207
No, she drank because
Mike called her from Rikers,

30:41.240 --> 30:43.342
and told her that he
was gonna kill himself.

30:43.375 --> 30:45.945
And he's not dead, is he?

30:45.978 --> 30:47.980
You can't protect her.

30:52.518 --> 30:54.220
I'm taking my daughter home.

30:54.253 --> 30:56.022
I don't think that's advisable.

30:56.055 --> 30:57.423
I don't care
what you think!

30:57.456 --> 30:59.558
It's my decision.

30:59.591 --> 31:02.294
Cora's going home.

31:06.265 --> 31:09.301
(Benson)
Virginia Kennison won't
accept the diagnosis.

31:09.335 --> 31:11.370
She wants to keep
Cora's body alive

31:11.403 --> 31:12.438
even though her mind is dead.

31:12.471 --> 31:15.141
Cora and her mom haven't been
close for a long time.

31:15.174 --> 31:16.976
Virginia's gotta
be feeling guilty.

31:17.009 --> 31:18.310
She's not the only one.

31:18.344 --> 31:20.546
I pushed her to testify.

31:20.579 --> 31:22.949
And I subpoenaed her.

31:22.982 --> 31:25.384
How's this gonna
affect the trial?

31:25.417 --> 31:26.618
Well, it won't.
Cora finished her testimony,

31:26.652 --> 31:29.121
so the defense can't
ask for a mistrial.

31:29.155 --> 31:31.991
Too bad the corrections
officers got to Mike

31:32.024 --> 31:33.325
before he could off himself,

31:33.359 --> 31:35.227
and he wouldn't have
to finish the trial.

31:35.261 --> 31:36.562
I'll still convict
the bastard.

31:36.595 --> 31:38.330
(A.D.A. Harbin)
Casey!

31:38.364 --> 31:39.698
The office has been
trying to find you.

31:39.731 --> 31:41.267
I had my phone off in court.

31:41.300 --> 31:43.335
Judge Donnelly wants you
in chambers now.

31:43.369 --> 31:45.671
This can't be good.

31:47.706 --> 31:50.276
(Donnelly)
What's your business,
counselor?

31:50.309 --> 31:51.978
My client is seeking
a court order

31:52.011 --> 31:53.379
to have the feeding
tube removed.

31:53.412 --> 31:56.282
He has no right to remove
Cora's feeding tube.

31:56.315 --> 31:58.017
(Grahame-Bishop)
He has every right.

31:58.050 --> 32:00.252
Cora Jergens is his wife.
The wedding was a sham.

32:00.286 --> 32:02.321
He only married Cora
to keep her from testifying.

32:02.354 --> 32:05.057
(Grahame-Bishop)
She chose to marry my client.

32:05.091 --> 32:06.425
Where as you forced her
to testify.

32:06.458 --> 32:07.093
You couldn't shut her
up at trial,

32:07.126 --> 32:09.128
so you shut her up forever?

32:09.161 --> 32:10.296
This is retaliation, Your Honor.

32:10.329 --> 32:11.697
This is an act of love.

32:11.730 --> 32:13.232
Hold on.

32:13.265 --> 32:15.334
Dr. Jergens, I'd like
to know why

32:15.367 --> 32:17.436
you made this decision.

32:17.469 --> 32:20.272
I've spoken with my wife's
neurosurgeon.

32:20.306 --> 32:23.275
Cora is in a chronic,
vegetative state.

32:23.309 --> 32:24.510
She has no cortical activity,

32:24.543 --> 32:26.145
or EEG.

32:26.178 --> 32:27.613
She'll never recover.

32:27.646 --> 32:30.149
I can't let her suffer.

32:30.182 --> 32:32.384
Don't let him do this.

32:32.418 --> 32:36.422
The law is clear.
I don't have a choice, Casey.

32:36.455 --> 32:37.289
What about Cora's mother?

32:37.323 --> 32:40.292
She wants to continue
life support.

32:40.326 --> 32:42.361
I'm sure this will be very
difficult for Mrs. Kennison

32:42.394 --> 32:44.997
to accept, but she
has no standing.

32:45.031 --> 32:46.298
As Cora's husband,

32:46.332 --> 32:49.468
Michael Jergens is
the next of kin.

32:49.501 --> 32:50.669
So a rapist has more rights
than her mother.

32:50.702 --> 32:52.504
In this case, yes.

32:52.538 --> 32:54.473
(Stabler)
This judge is giving Mike
exactly what he wants.

32:54.506 --> 32:56.408
Ultimate control.

32:56.442 --> 32:58.644
He's the wrong person
making the right decision.

32:58.677 --> 33:02.281
You think Cora should
be taken off life support?

33:02.314 --> 33:03.782
Cora's never getting better.

33:03.815 --> 33:06.418
She deserves
to die with dignity.

33:06.452 --> 33:09.088
(Stabler)
Mrs. Kennison wants to keep
Cora alive.

33:09.121 --> 33:10.456
She has been her mother
for 30 years.

33:10.489 --> 33:12.391
I think that counts more
than a quickie marriage.

33:12.424 --> 33:14.260
(Munch)
None of this matters.

33:14.293 --> 33:16.528
It's not up to us to decide
when life ends.

33:16.562 --> 33:18.230
So Cora should suffer.

33:18.264 --> 33:19.698
(Munch)
All right, disconnect her.

33:19.731 --> 33:21.467
Who's next?

33:21.500 --> 33:23.502
Are we gonna decide
the quadriplegic's lives

33:23.535 --> 33:24.603
aren't worth living?

33:24.636 --> 33:26.338
What about the severely
retarded?

33:26.372 --> 33:27.306
We kill them too?

33:27.339 --> 33:29.375
No one's suggesting
we murder the disabled.

33:29.408 --> 33:31.610
The Nazis didn't call it
murder either.

33:31.643 --> 33:34.780
I have to follow the law.

33:34.813 --> 33:37.083
But I would feel a lot
better about it

33:37.116 --> 33:38.750
if I knew what Cora would want.

33:38.784 --> 33:43.055
Okay, who would know that
better than her own mother?

33:43.089 --> 33:46.525
No, she's trying to communicate.
She's fighting for her life.

33:46.558 --> 33:48.494
And did she ever tell you
what she'd want

33:48.527 --> 33:50.396
if something like
this happened?

33:50.429 --> 33:52.764
No, we never talked about it.

33:52.798 --> 33:56.335
But I know my daughter.
And she's not a quitter.

33:56.368 --> 34:00.072
Her father got sick
when she was eight.

34:00.106 --> 34:03.175
They gave him
six months to live.

34:03.209 --> 34:05.511
She went to the hospital
every day.

34:05.544 --> 34:07.546
And she'd sit by the bed,
and she'd say,

34:07.579 --> 34:09.215
Daddy, don't give up.

34:09.248 --> 34:11.417
He lived for two years.

34:11.450 --> 34:16.388
He said Cora gave him
the strength to hang on.

34:16.422 --> 34:19.558
And you are sure
she'd wanna live like this?

34:19.591 --> 34:22.228
I know she'd want to fight.

34:22.261 --> 34:23.295
But how do I stop Mike?

34:26.498 --> 34:29.535
You could file an appeal
of Judge Donnelly's ruling.

34:29.568 --> 34:31.337
A lot of good it'll do.

34:31.370 --> 34:33.405
I mean the law's
not on my side.

34:33.439 --> 34:36.308
And the judge,
she won't listen to me.

34:38.410 --> 34:41.747
There are other ways
to make people listen.

34:43.649 --> 34:45.284
What the hell were you thinking?

34:45.317 --> 34:47.519
Cora's mom went to the papers.
How is that my fault?

34:47.553 --> 34:49.588
You gave her the baloney,
and she made the sandwich.

34:49.621 --> 34:51.123
Says so on page three.

34:51.157 --> 34:53.392
You told her to shout
her story from the rooftops.

34:53.425 --> 34:54.893
She's frustrated
and she's voiceless.

34:54.926 --> 34:56.595
And the law can't help her.

34:56.628 --> 34:58.164
Which is the reason
you have no business

34:58.197 --> 34:59.465
involving yourself
in this mess.

34:59.498 --> 35:01.400
We speak for the victims.
And you taught me that.

35:01.433 --> 35:02.534
Crime victims.

35:02.568 --> 35:04.503
Nobody's committing
a crime here.

35:04.536 --> 35:06.172
Mike Jergens did.

35:06.205 --> 35:08.340
So should a rapist who's been
her husband for a week

35:08.374 --> 35:09.508
get to pull the plug on Cora?

35:09.541 --> 35:11.143
She married him.

35:11.177 --> 35:13.712
He conned her, he doesn't know
what Cora really wants.

35:13.745 --> 35:14.846
And you do?

35:14.880 --> 35:16.448
Her mother does.

35:16.482 --> 35:17.449
Based on what?

35:17.483 --> 35:19.485
Letters, diaries,
a memorable conversation?

35:19.518 --> 35:20.852
A living will?

35:20.886 --> 35:22.521
Based on the mother
knowing her child.

35:22.554 --> 35:24.223
That's not enough.

35:24.256 --> 35:26.525
There's a difference
between law and justice.

35:26.558 --> 35:27.826
Casey, I agree.

35:27.859 --> 35:29.595
But this is not your fight.

35:29.628 --> 35:32.464
Casey, turn on New York One.

35:39.605 --> 35:42.241
(Branch)
Protect the disabled.

35:42.274 --> 35:45.344
Looks like there's
no stopping mama now.

35:45.377 --> 35:48.614
This rapist is
trying to kill Cora.

35:48.647 --> 35:50.749
Do not let him do it.

35:50.782 --> 35:54.653
Please, I know my daughter.
I know she wants to live.

35:54.686 --> 35:57.589
Help me fight back.

35:57.623 --> 35:59.425
This is legalized murder.
Please.

35:59.458 --> 36:01.627
Help me send a message
to the judge

36:01.660 --> 36:05.397
to protect the disabled.

36:05.431 --> 36:07.633
Don't let a tragedy
turn into a circus.

36:07.666 --> 36:10.436
Convince Mrs. Kennison
that the case oughta be tried

36:10.469 --> 36:14.706
in a court of law, not
in a court of public opinion.

36:16.942 --> 36:19.511
Lawyers from around the country
are calling to take Cora's case.

36:19.545 --> 36:21.580
Thank you for telling me
to fight back.

36:21.613 --> 36:23.815
I didn't mean for you
to go on the national news.

36:23.849 --> 36:25.584
This should be
a family decision.

36:25.617 --> 36:26.518
Not a public free-for-all.

36:26.552 --> 36:28.987
Well, this has nothing to do
with me or Cora.

36:29.020 --> 36:30.256
People are angry.

36:30.289 --> 36:34.660
They don't want the government
deciding who lives and who dies.

36:38.464 --> 36:40.499
What's he doing here?

36:40.532 --> 36:41.667
Judge Donnelly authorized
this visit.

36:41.700 --> 36:42.601
(Kennison)
I don't care,

36:42.634 --> 36:44.636
I don't want him
anywhere near my daughter.

36:44.670 --> 36:45.571
(Mike)
Mrs. Kennison,

36:45.604 --> 36:48.540
I know you don't believe
that I love Cora,

36:48.574 --> 36:49.941
but I do.

36:49.975 --> 36:52.311
And I know she would not
wanna live like this.

36:52.344 --> 36:53.579
You know nothing.

36:53.612 --> 36:54.880
I lived with her every day

36:54.913 --> 36:57.516
for the last year,
you never called her once.

36:57.549 --> 36:58.984
Because you pulled us apart.

36:59.017 --> 37:02.688
I have always loved my daughter.

37:09.595 --> 37:11.663
Why didn't you tell me
he'd be here?

37:11.697 --> 37:15.701
My client doesn't need your
permission to visit his wife.

37:17.736 --> 37:18.870
Is that the consent form?

37:18.904 --> 37:20.005
(doctor)
It's an injunction.

37:20.038 --> 37:22.007
The court has granted
Mrs. Kennison

37:22.040 --> 37:25.544
an emergency hearing
to determine Cora's wishes.

37:27.813 --> 37:30.649
(Mike)
I promised Cora I would never
let her live like this.

37:30.682 --> 37:34.620
(Grahame-Bishop)
And did you have a discussion
about end of life issues?

37:34.653 --> 37:36.588
Yes.

37:36.622 --> 37:39.925
Would you please tell the court
about that conversation?

37:39.958 --> 37:43.629
One night last summer, we were
driving back from the beach.

37:43.662 --> 37:46.598
There was a terrible accident
right in front of us.

37:46.632 --> 37:48.033
A drunk driver
ran a stop sign,

37:48.066 --> 37:51.937
and T-boned a young couple
in a convertible.

37:51.970 --> 37:54.806
I told Cora to call 911,
and I ran over to help.

37:54.840 --> 37:58.076
How bad was it?

37:58.109 --> 37:59.645
The man was dead.

37:59.678 --> 38:02.314
And his girlfriend had
severe head trauma.

38:02.348 --> 38:03.882
She was unresponsive.

38:03.915 --> 38:07.786
All I could do was clear her
airway so she could breathe.

38:07.819 --> 38:10.622
I was covered in blood,
and then I heard Cora crying.

38:10.656 --> 38:12.758
(Grahame-Bishop)
And did Cora say anything?

38:12.791 --> 38:14.860
(Mike)
She asked me if
the girl was gonna make it.

38:14.893 --> 38:17.696
And I said that if she did,

38:17.729 --> 38:19.465
that she would be a vegetable.

38:19.498 --> 38:22.768
(Grahame-Bishop)
And how did Cora take that?

38:22.801 --> 38:23.835
She said, Mike,

38:23.869 --> 38:26.772
promise me you will never
let me live like that.

38:26.805 --> 38:30.742
That's a lie.
Cora never said that.

38:30.776 --> 38:31.643
Mrs. Kennison--

38:31.677 --> 38:32.911
You bastard!

38:32.944 --> 38:34.079
(Donnelly bangs gavel)
Order!

38:34.112 --> 38:35.381
(Kennison)
Don't believe him!

38:35.414 --> 38:37.516
(Donnelly)
Sit down, Mrs. Kennison.

38:37.549 --> 38:39.551
No! I won't let him
kill my baby!

38:39.585 --> 38:41.720
Clear the court.
We're in recess.

38:41.753 --> 38:46.057
What are you doing?

38:54.966 --> 38:58.136
After reviewing all
the medical testimony,

38:58.169 --> 39:03.375
I am convinced that Cora's
condition is irreversible.

39:03.409 --> 39:06.144
(Donnelly)
Her mind is gone.

39:06.177 --> 39:09.147
And medicine cannot
cure her.

39:09.180 --> 39:10.816
Only an act of God,

39:10.849 --> 39:15.086
a true miracle,
could recreate her brain.

39:15.120 --> 39:18.390
Both Mrs. Kennison
and Dr. Jergens believe

39:18.424 --> 39:19.791
they know what Cora
would've wanted.

39:19.825 --> 39:22.394
But while Mrs. Kennison's
belief

39:22.428 --> 39:24.162
is based on
a mother's instinct,

39:24.195 --> 39:27.866
Dr. Jergens testimony provided
compelling evidence

39:27.899 --> 39:31.937
that Cora's desire
is not to live

39:31.970 --> 39:33.939
in a persistent,
vegetative state.

39:33.972 --> 39:37.776
Therefore,

39:37.809 --> 39:40.111
I am lifting
the injunction.

39:40.145 --> 39:44.683
Dr. Jergens may remove
Cora's feeding tube.

40:02.901 --> 40:06.905
She went peacefully.
Just like she wanted.

40:06.938 --> 40:11.643
Thank you for letting Virginia
hold her daughter's hand.

40:11.677 --> 40:14.145
I know how much
it meant to her.

40:14.179 --> 40:15.981
You're welcome.

40:16.014 --> 40:17.983
Now there's something
you can do for me.

40:18.016 --> 40:20.652
Like what?

40:20.686 --> 40:21.920
Expedite the Death Certificate.

40:21.953 --> 40:23.822
The life insurance company's
gonna need that

40:23.855 --> 40:25.056
before they can
process my claim.

40:25.090 --> 40:29.528
I should've known.

40:29.561 --> 40:30.896
How much you gonna get?

40:30.929 --> 40:32.998
$1.5 million.

40:33.031 --> 40:36.468
I added Cora to my policy
right after we got married.

40:36.502 --> 40:38.103
You were never gonna
kill yourself.

40:38.136 --> 40:41.039
But you knew that Cora
wouldn't live without you.

40:41.072 --> 40:44.209
That's a terrible thing to say
to a grieving husband.

40:44.242 --> 40:46.011
Get him the hell out of here!

40:46.044 --> 40:48.580
Come see me tomorrow.

40:48.614 --> 40:51.883
We need to get started
on my appeal.

41:00.926 --> 41:03.028
Is there anything else
I need to sign?

41:03.061 --> 41:06.765
No, but I do have the results
of the autopsy.

41:06.798 --> 41:08.834
Oh, tell me.

41:08.867 --> 41:11.870
I found widespread cell death
in Cora's cerebral cortex.

41:11.903 --> 41:14.272
The damage to her brain
was irreversible.

41:14.305 --> 41:16.808
So there was never any hope.

41:16.842 --> 41:18.877
No.

41:18.910 --> 41:20.779
There's something else
you should know.

41:20.812 --> 41:23.615
We found a newspaper article
about the car accident

41:23.649 --> 41:25.984
that Cora witnessed.

41:26.017 --> 41:28.587
Was Mike telling the truth?

41:28.620 --> 41:30.989
Cora told a reporter that what
happened to that young girl

41:31.022 --> 41:32.758
was a tragedy.

41:32.791 --> 41:35.661
She said she'd never wanna
live like that.

41:43.935 --> 41:48.039
Thank you.

41:48.073 --> 41:49.975
[sighs]
