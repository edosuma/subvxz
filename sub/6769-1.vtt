WEBVTT

00:03.503 --> 00:06.756
How about when Muntz started
freaking your mom? (giggles)

00:06.840 --> 00:09.467
{\an3}No, my favorite was
when Noah got onstage

00:09.551 --> 00:10.760
and butchered "Feelings."

00:10.844 --> 00:12.762
Oh, my God, he did
do that, didn't he?

00:12.846 --> 00:13.805
{\an3}Mm-hmm.

00:13.888 --> 00:16.433
It was weird.

00:16.516 --> 00:18.935
{\an3}At first, no one could
look me in the eye,

00:19.018 --> 00:22.480
{\an3}then they saw how at peace
Brandon and I are.

00:22.564 --> 00:24.941
{\an1}Well, that's
the wonder of it.

00:25.024 --> 00:27.777
You guys are at peace.

00:27.861 --> 00:29.070
{\an3}Yeah.

00:33.032 --> 00:33.992
{\an3}NOAH:
Your parents leave?

00:34.075 --> 00:35.577
BRANDON:
Finally.

00:35.660 --> 00:37.579
They're still
on Hong Kong time.

00:37.662 --> 00:40.457
Either that or they're still
in a state of shock.

00:40.540 --> 00:42.292
Great party.

00:42.375 --> 00:43.710
Amazing what seven
cases of champagne

00:43.793 --> 00:45.128
{\an3}and a great band
will do.

00:45.211 --> 00:48.590
So, uh, why didn't you do it?

00:48.673 --> 00:49.841
Besides sheer panic?

00:49.924 --> 00:53.303
Because the closer Kelly and I
got to being husband and wife,

00:53.386 --> 00:55.138
the more we felt like brother
and sister.

00:55.221 --> 00:56.973
That's good reason
for a breakup.

00:57.056 --> 01:00.560
Breakup... right.

01:05.230 --> 01:06.483
Everybody gone?

01:06.566 --> 01:07.484
{\an3}Just.

01:07.567 --> 01:09.527
{\an1}So, uh...

01:09.611 --> 01:10.820
Yeah.

01:10.904 --> 01:11.946
{\an3}Well, I don't know
about you guys,

01:12.030 --> 01:12.864
{\an3}but I'm not
tired at all.

01:12.947 --> 01:14.032
We should do something.

01:14.115 --> 01:16.868
Yo, um... there's...

01:16.951 --> 01:17.952
Here's an idea.

01:18.036 --> 01:19.287
Why don't you
go to sleep?

01:19.370 --> 01:20.371
(chuckles)

01:20.455 --> 01:23.458
The limo driver's still out
front if you need him.

01:23.541 --> 01:25.668
Honeymoon suite, whoops.

01:25.752 --> 01:27.587
We won't be needing him.

01:27.670 --> 01:29.506
Or any of you.

01:29.589 --> 01:31.841
{\an3}Are you sure there's
nothing I can do?

01:31.925 --> 01:33.009
No. We're fine, thanks.

01:33.092 --> 01:34.010
{\an3}Okay.

01:34.093 --> 01:35.136
Good night.

01:35.220 --> 01:36.846
{\an3}Good night.

01:36.930 --> 01:38.515
Good night.

01:38.598 --> 01:39.599
{\an3}(sighs)

01:41.643 --> 01:42.894
(door closes)

01:42.977 --> 01:44.312
We will be, you know?

01:44.395 --> 01:46.606
We'll be fine.

01:46.689 --> 01:48.191
{\an1}I know.

01:50.944 --> 01:52.862
So, did you get
anything to eat?

01:52.946 --> 01:55.031
{\an1}Mm, too busy telling everyone
how happy we are.

01:55.114 --> 01:57.742
Let's see what
we've got here.

01:57.826 --> 02:00.203
Ooh, leftovers.

02:02.580 --> 02:05.708
We have salmon
and vegetables.

02:05.792 --> 02:07.418
Looks good.

02:07.502 --> 02:09.044
{\an3}Mmm...
Try this.

02:11.965 --> 02:13.383
{\an3}(chuckles)
It's good?

02:13.466 --> 02:14.592
Mm-hmm.

02:14.676 --> 02:16.594
Try it.

02:16.678 --> 02:17.929
{\an3}Mmm.

02:18.012 --> 02:19.389
Nice.

02:20.807 --> 02:22.934
{\an3}Very nice.

02:36.823 --> 02:38.366
Mm.

02:45.540 --> 02:47.458
Should we be doing this?

02:47.542 --> 02:49.252
I have no idea.

I always thought so.

04:51.457 --> 04:53.334
{\an1}Did you?

04:53.418 --> 04:55.878
{\an1}'Cause I never gave
it a thought.

04:55.962 --> 04:57.922
{\an3}We all take things
for granted.

04:58.006 --> 05:00.550
Some things, yeah.

05:00.633 --> 05:03.177
Not everything, though.

05:03.261 --> 05:07.724
{\an1}Your family
and your friends...

05:07.807 --> 05:12.770
this place... you.

05:12.854 --> 05:14.939
You got a do-over here.

05:15.023 --> 05:19.527
This incredible joyous...

05:19.610 --> 05:21.821
{\an1}...completely undeserved
second chance.

05:23.906 --> 05:25.199
We've been over this.

05:25.283 --> 05:29.746
Then let's go over
it again... please?

05:29.829 --> 05:32.749
You took a blood test, Val,
not a test of character.

05:32.832 --> 05:34.250
Thank God.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.044
And it came back negative.

05:37.503 --> 05:39.756
Yesterday you tested negative
for HIV.

05:39.839 --> 05:42.967
Now. But I still have to take
another test in six months.

05:43.051 --> 05:44.927
It's a good thing.

05:45.011 --> 05:47.930
You should be happy.

05:48.014 --> 05:50.433
I know.

05:50.516 --> 05:51.934
I want to be.

05:52.018 --> 05:53.436
You deserve to be.

05:53.519 --> 05:56.105
I really wish I believed that.

05:59.192 --> 06:00.109
Come on.

06:00.193 --> 06:01.861
{\an3}Everything's
gonna be okay.

06:08.868 --> 06:10.286
{\an1}So how'd it go
last night?

06:10.369 --> 06:12.080
{\an3}As I recall,
I didn't get married.

06:12.163 --> 06:13.790
{\an1}No, later. After
all the guests left.

06:13.873 --> 06:16.292
{\an1}Saying good-bye to Kelly
must have been very difficult.

06:16.375 --> 06:19.337
Probably would have been
if I could have done it.

06:20.338 --> 06:21.339
(chuckles)

06:21.422 --> 06:23.633
{\an1}You call off the wedding,
and then you sleep with her?

06:23.716 --> 06:25.301
I think it's called
<i>Love Among the Ruins.</i>

06:25.384 --> 06:26.803
{\an1}No, that's sex
with the ex, Bran.

06:26.886 --> 06:27.929
Oh.

06:28.012 --> 06:29.347
{\an1}Where's does
this leave you?

06:29.430 --> 06:31.224
I'm about to find out.

06:34.393 --> 06:35.311
Good morning.

06:35.394 --> 06:37.647
{\an1}Hi.
Hi.

06:37.730 --> 06:41.818
I, uh, have all the presents
arranged by store, I think.

06:41.901 --> 06:43.319
Great.

06:43.402 --> 06:45.696
{\an3}I'm sure after we tell them
what happened,

06:45.780 --> 06:47.824
{\an3}they'll have generous
return policies.

06:47.907 --> 06:49.992
Kel, about what did happen...

06:50.076 --> 06:52.286
While I'm doing this,
I would like it

06:52.370 --> 06:53.704
{\an3}if you would call the party
supply store, okay?

06:53.788 --> 06:55.331
{\an3}Kel, about last night.
Have them come

06:55.414 --> 06:57.500
and pick up the tables
and the dance floor, okay?

06:57.583 --> 07:00.670
Fine, fine, I'll do that
as soon as I get to work.

07:00.753 --> 07:02.171
You're going to work?

07:02.255 --> 07:03.840
Is there something else
I should be doing?

07:03.923 --> 07:06.384
We just have a lot
of loose ends here.

07:06.467 --> 07:09.303
I agree. Unfortunately, you
don't want to talk about them.

07:09.387 --> 07:11.180
{\an1}STEVE:
Uh, I'm out of here.

07:11.264 --> 07:14.016
{\an3}Steve, can you, uh,
do me a favor,

07:14.100 --> 07:15.601
{\an3}drop off
these presents?

07:15.685 --> 07:17.019
{\an3}It's on your way
to the paper.

07:17.103 --> 07:18.020
{\an1}STEVE:
Yeah, sure.

07:18.104 --> 07:19.063
Look, I just want to say

07:19.147 --> 07:21.399
you guys are handling this
situation really well.

07:28.406 --> 07:30.533
Look, Mom, the answer's no.

07:30.616 --> 07:32.243
But it's his birthday.

07:32.326 --> 07:33.828
Exactly. Why ruin it?

07:33.911 --> 07:35.538
He wants you to come to dinner.

07:35.621 --> 07:36.330
Why?

07:36.414 --> 07:37.832
Because you're his son.

07:37.915 --> 07:40.126
I was his son the last year
and the year before that.

07:40.209 --> 07:41.127
Didn't matter to him then.

07:41.210 --> 07:41.752
Well, it does now.

07:41.836 --> 07:43.337
And that should be enough.

07:43.421 --> 07:44.672
Well, I'm sorry, it's not.

07:44.755 --> 07:46.048
Noah, please.

07:46.132 --> 07:47.675
He needs you.

07:47.758 --> 07:49.886
I wish I could believe that.
I really do.

07:49.969 --> 07:51.262
I got to go.

07:55.391 --> 07:57.059
You want to talk about it?

07:57.143 --> 07:59.520
My mom invited us over
for my dad's birthday,

07:59.604 --> 08:00.730
and I told her no.

08:00.813 --> 08:04.567
{\an1}I don't want
to talk about it.

08:04.650 --> 08:06.152
Well, I'm on my way to Kelly's.

08:06.235 --> 08:08.237
I could stop
and pick him up a present.

08:08.321 --> 08:11.073
I wish you wouldn't do that,
all right?

08:11.157 --> 08:13.284
Okay.

08:17.246 --> 08:19.415
{\an5}STEVE:
Great. Store credit
would be fine.

08:19.498 --> 08:21.792
Um, I just need each item
credited separately, okay?

08:21.876 --> 08:23.211
No problem.

08:25.296 --> 08:27.089
{\an3}Hi.

08:27.173 --> 08:29.592
I'm just here returning
some wedding gifts.

08:29.675 --> 08:30.801
Mm-hmm.

08:30.885 --> 08:32.260
{\an3}Not mine, of course.
(chuckles)

08:32.345 --> 08:33.471
I'm Steve.

08:33.554 --> 08:34.472
Here you go.

08:34.554 --> 08:35.597
Separate receipts.

08:35.681 --> 08:36.599
Thanks very much.

08:37.390 --> 08:38.976
I didn't catch your name.

08:39.059 --> 08:39.936
No, you didn't.

08:40.019 --> 08:42.938
Ouch.

08:45.149 --> 08:46.609
That'll be $12.95, please.

08:46.692 --> 08:48.277
I'm sorry, it's all I have.

08:48.361 --> 08:50.947
Out of $50.

08:57.203 --> 08:59.789
{\an1}Hi. Um, could you give
me a ride?

08:59.872 --> 09:01.123
I don't think so.

09:01.207 --> 09:04.961
{\an1}Please, 'cause I-I could
really use your help.

09:05.044 --> 09:05.962
Just drive.

09:06.045 --> 09:08.798
(engine starts)

09:08.881 --> 09:09.799
{\an1}Go! Drive!

09:09.882 --> 09:10.925
(tires squeal)

09:15.221 --> 09:16.973
{\an3}You okay?

09:17.056 --> 09:18.724
{\an1}Yeah.

09:21.602 --> 09:23.521
{\an1}I thought that frame
was on sale.

09:23.604 --> 09:24.522
{\an3}Mm.

09:24.605 --> 09:26.190
{\an1}When she told me
it wasn't,

09:26.274 --> 09:28.567
I went to put it back
on the counter, right,

09:28.651 --> 09:30.653
and I broke the glass.

09:30.736 --> 09:32.822
The salesperson wanted
you to pay for it, huh?

09:32.905 --> 09:33.656
{\an1}Yeah.

09:33.739 --> 09:36.325
{\an1}Anyway, one thing
led to another and...

09:36.409 --> 09:38.703
{\an3}And you wound up
in my car.

09:38.786 --> 09:41.289
Yeah.
Hmm.

09:41.372 --> 09:42.999
Your nice car.

09:43.082 --> 09:44.667
Thanks. It's new.

09:44.750 --> 09:48.838
{\an1}By the way,
my name is Sophie.

09:48.921 --> 09:52.300
Sophie. That's
a pretty name.

09:54.593 --> 09:56.512
I don't need a pity party,
Donna.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.014
{\an3}That's not
what it is.

09:58.097 --> 09:59.307
{\an1}So you'll meet
with the caterer

09:59.390 --> 10:00.349
{\an1}about the china,
right?

10:00.433 --> 10:01.851
{\an3}Going to the club,
it'll be fun.

10:01.934 --> 10:02.852
{\an1}The china?

10:02.935 --> 10:03.894
It's under control.

10:03.978 --> 10:06.230
Good. Thanks.

10:06.314 --> 10:07.690
I found a card

10:07.773 --> 10:09.483
{\an3}for every gift
except one.

10:09.567 --> 10:11.068
{\an1}Impressive.
So we on or what?

10:11.152 --> 10:13.070
{\an3}Donna, I can't return
it without a card.

10:13.154 --> 10:14.071
So don't return it.

10:14.155 --> 10:15.072
(doorbell rings)

10:15.156 --> 10:17.408
It was a wedding gift.
There was no wedding.

10:18.409 --> 10:20.161
Hi, sorry to bother you.

10:20.244 --> 10:21.287
Oh, it's okay, Phyllis,

10:21.370 --> 10:23.706
as long as my mom didn't send
you to set me up again.

10:23.789 --> 10:25.374
No, I left my purse
at the reception.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.209
It's green leather.
It's got a little gold clasp.

10:27.293 --> 10:28.210
Have you seen it?

10:28.294 --> 10:30.671
Yep, I saw it.
I'll get it.

10:30.755 --> 10:32.173
Thank God. Thanks.

10:32.256 --> 10:35.509
{\an3}Wasn't she just the
most beautiful bride? Oh!

10:35.593 --> 10:36.552
I thought so.

10:36.635 --> 10:37.386
And that dress.

10:37.470 --> 10:39.513
{\an3}I would love to know
who designed this.

10:39.597 --> 10:40.556
You would?

10:40.639 --> 10:42.224
Mm. A really good
friend of mine's

10:42.308 --> 10:43.225
a buyer down
at Rudman's.

10:43.309 --> 10:44.226
Oh, I'm telling you,

10:44.310 --> 10:46.520
to be in business with someone
that talented,

10:46.604 --> 10:47.855
he'd give up his firstborn.

10:47.938 --> 10:49.106
Well, here's your purse.

10:49.190 --> 10:50.399
Oh, thank you.

10:50.483 --> 10:51.734
{\an3}I can't believe
I did that.

10:51.817 --> 10:52.985
{\an1}Here's the number
of the designer

10:53.069 --> 10:53.944
you were talking about.

10:54.028 --> 10:55.404
And here's your designer.

10:55.488 --> 10:56.447
Kel...

10:56.530 --> 10:58.282
Oh, you're kidding. Great.

10:58.366 --> 10:59.784
{\an1}You should have your
friend give her a call.

10:59.867 --> 11:00.868
I'll do that.

11:00.951 --> 11:02.828
Thanks again for my purse.

11:02.912 --> 11:04.163
{\an1}Bye.
KELLY: Bye.

11:06.957 --> 11:08.417
{\an3}Sounds like a good
opportunity.

11:08.501 --> 11:10.628
{\an1}Mm, I don't want a job
that's linked

11:10.711 --> 11:12.088
{\an1}to something
you'd rather forget.

11:12.171 --> 11:14.131
You know what, listen
to the guy when he calls.

11:14.215 --> 11:16.425
If it sounds like a good job,
you should take it.

11:16.509 --> 11:19.220
That way, at least something
good will come out of this mess.

11:22.390 --> 11:24.517
(sighs)

11:26.644 --> 11:28.437
It's simple, okay?

11:28.521 --> 11:30.439
{\an3}You're good, you
deserve to be happy;

11:30.523 --> 11:31.565
you're bad, you don't.

11:31.649 --> 11:32.733
So be good.

11:32.817 --> 11:34.402
Like that wipes
the slate clean.

11:34.485 --> 11:37.113
Val, you acted bad, okay?

11:37.196 --> 11:39.115
It doesn't make you
a bad person.

11:39.198 --> 11:43.786
{\an1}Weak, maybe scared,
but not bad.

11:43.869 --> 11:45.079
And what if I'm still scared?

11:45.162 --> 11:46.789
Admit it.

11:46.872 --> 11:48.749
Stop hiding behind lies.

11:48.833 --> 11:49.917
Be honest?

11:50.000 --> 11:52.920
Ah, club sandwich,
I presume?

11:53.003 --> 11:54.630
No, not in the mood.

11:54.713 --> 11:56.590
Mega burger.

11:56.674 --> 11:59.135
{\an3}No, I don't
like 'em.

11:59.218 --> 12:01.679
{\an3}Chicken fingers,
hot dogs, quesadillas.

12:01.762 --> 12:03.514
Nat, you really need
to update this menu.

12:03.597 --> 12:07.309
Oh, yeah, update.

12:07.393 --> 12:09.145
(sighs)

12:09.228 --> 12:11.814
{\an1}You know, Val,
honesty is good,

12:11.897 --> 12:14.483
but you might want to steer
clear of the brutal variety.

12:14.567 --> 12:15.651
Where're you going?

12:15.734 --> 12:17.153
I've got a meeting
with Kyle Scott,

12:17.236 --> 12:18.696
the guy I do the jingles for.

12:18.779 --> 12:20.656
Well, I hope
you're going to tell him

12:20.739 --> 12:22.324
you're too good
to be hawking product.

12:22.408 --> 12:25.828
Well, I am too good,
but I've also got bills to pay.

12:25.911 --> 12:27.496
So you're going to be dishonest?

12:27.580 --> 12:28.914
No, practical.

12:28.998 --> 12:31.333
Whatever happened to the truth
shall set you free?

12:31.417 --> 12:33.002
It will set you free.

12:33.085 --> 12:35.337
It'll get me in trouble.

12:35.421 --> 12:37.089
(scoffs)

12:40.676 --> 12:42.845
Janet, I'm glad you're here.

12:42.928 --> 12:44.180
This is yours.

12:44.263 --> 12:45.514
My wedding present?

12:45.598 --> 12:47.892
Yeah. We felt like
they should be returned.

12:47.975 --> 12:49.351
Oh, no, you guys
didn't have to...

12:49.435 --> 12:50.352
Yes, we did.

12:50.436 --> 12:52.188
Brandon, what time
are the party people coming

12:52.271 --> 12:53.314
to pick up the tables?

12:53.397 --> 12:55.024
I didn't call them yet.

12:55.107 --> 12:57.359
You said you were going to do
that as soon as you got here.

12:57.443 --> 13:00.529
Janet, I've got a couple
of ideas on this mockup,

13:00.613 --> 13:03.157
{\an4}but give me
a second, will you?
Okay.

13:06.827 --> 13:08.412
Why are you angry at me?

13:08.496 --> 13:10.372
Because you said you were going
to do something and you didn't.

13:10.456 --> 13:12.082
We wouldn't have
been happy, Kel.

13:12.166 --> 13:13.918
I need you to remind me why.

13:14.001 --> 13:16.003
Because us staying together,

13:16.086 --> 13:17.922
{\an3}we were just holding
on to the past.

13:18.005 --> 13:19.840
{\an3}We weren't getting on
with our futures.

13:19.924 --> 13:21.050
Last night made me feel sad.

13:21.133 --> 13:22.218
I felt connected.

13:22.301 --> 13:23.969
So did I.

13:24.053 --> 13:25.346
{\an1}Incredibly, and
that's what hurts.

13:25.429 --> 13:28.057
I know exactly
how that feels.

13:28.140 --> 13:29.391
I don't think you do.

13:29.475 --> 13:31.060
I mean, look at you.

13:31.143 --> 13:32.770
You're just going
about your day...

13:32.853 --> 13:33.979
That's how I deal, Kel.

13:34.063 --> 13:35.105
Like nothing happened.

13:35.189 --> 13:36.899
It's just how I deal.

13:36.982 --> 13:40.736
{\an1}I think we made
the wrong decision.

13:40.819 --> 13:42.488
Do you?

13:47.785 --> 13:49.370
Kel, wait.

13:49.453 --> 13:51.080
Just forget it.

14:03.300 --> 14:05.094
STEVE:
<i>Biology?</i>

14:05.177 --> 14:06.303
{\an1}Mm-hmm.

14:06.387 --> 14:08.597
{\an1}C.U. has a very good
graduate program.

14:08.681 --> 14:09.640
I'm sure they do.

14:09.723 --> 14:10.474
It's just I had you pegged

14:10.558 --> 14:11.600
{\an3}for something a
little less low-key.

14:11.684 --> 14:13.561
Hmm, disappointed?

14:13.644 --> 14:14.937
No, actually the opposite.

14:15.020 --> 14:16.480
The last thing L.A. needs

14:16.564 --> 14:17.982
{\an3}is another person seeking
fame and fortune.

14:18.065 --> 14:21.652
Hmm. Isn't that the worst?

14:21.735 --> 14:23.779
Well, thanks for the coffee.

14:23.862 --> 14:25.447
Wish me luck.

14:25.531 --> 14:28.242
I'm off to find some poor slob
in need of a roommate.

14:28.325 --> 14:29.785
Aren't you living in the dorms?

14:29.868 --> 14:30.995
{\an1}Yeah, I'm
on the waiting list.

14:31.078 --> 14:32.997
Unfortunately, I'm also
on scholarship.

14:33.080 --> 14:35.791
So I doubt that you and I
are going to be neighbors.

14:35.874 --> 14:38.210
Do you know what you're looking
for in a poor slob?

14:38.294 --> 14:40.421
No. You know, just someone
who likes to have fun.

14:40.504 --> 14:41.463
Why? Know anyone?

14:41.547 --> 14:44.592
Well, not at C.U.,
but until a dorm room opens up,

14:44.675 --> 14:45.926
there's plenty of space here.

14:46.010 --> 14:47.511
Nice try.

14:47.595 --> 14:49.471
{\an3}No, strictly
business.

14:49.555 --> 14:51.599
If you want, I can talk to the
guy who owns this place tonight.

14:51.682 --> 14:52.766
I don't know.

14:52.850 --> 14:54.602
Did I mention
I like to have fun?

14:54.685 --> 14:57.813
What happens if I can't
pay my share?

14:57.896 --> 14:59.481
I'm not too worried about it.

14:59.565 --> 15:00.774
Well...

15:03.235 --> 15:04.778
...that's for saving me
this morning.

15:04.862 --> 15:05.946
And...

15:07.031 --> 15:08.532
...that's for saving me
this afternoon.

15:08.616 --> 15:09.783
(chuckles)

15:09.867 --> 15:12.786
{\an3}Come on, I'll show you around.
Okay.

15:14.955 --> 15:16.498
DONNA:
<i>Kelly's not a showy person.</i>

15:16.582 --> 15:19.126
So that's what I was going for--
simple elegance.

15:19.209 --> 15:20.794
Hmm.

15:23.422 --> 15:25.007
{\an1}I'll send someone
to pick it up later today.

15:25.090 --> 15:26.008
Pick it up?

15:26.091 --> 15:28.052
The dress-- I like it.

15:28.135 --> 15:29.720
{\an1}You do?
And I want to put it

15:29.803 --> 15:31.013
on display at the store.

15:31.096 --> 15:31.847
Generate interest.

15:31.930 --> 15:33.349
It's my friend's dress.

15:33.432 --> 15:34.516
Well, it brought her joy.

15:34.600 --> 15:36.393
Maybe it will do
the same for others.

15:36.477 --> 15:38.520
{\an3}That's the thing--
it didn't bring her joy.

15:38.604 --> 15:40.564
{\an3}So I'm not sure
how she's going to feel

15:40.648 --> 15:41.690
about having it displayed.

15:41.774 --> 15:43.067
Then I suggest you find out.

15:43.150 --> 15:45.861
{\an1}I need to know
by tomorrow at 9:00.

15:45.944 --> 15:48.072
Okay, thank you.

15:48.155 --> 15:48.947
You're welcome.

15:49.031 --> 15:51.659
NOAH:
What's that have to do with me?

15:51.742 --> 15:55.037
Mom, for the last time,
we're not coming.

15:55.120 --> 15:56.705
{\an1}All right?

15:56.789 --> 15:59.041
Bye.

15:59.124 --> 16:01.293
Come on, it's a dinner.

16:01.377 --> 16:03.504
Why don't we just agree
to disagree on that, okay?

16:03.587 --> 16:05.172
I was walking on Melrose and...

16:05.255 --> 16:07.383
and I saw these great cufflinks
and...

16:07.466 --> 16:09.051
I asked you not to interfere.

16:09.134 --> 16:11.595
I know, but I figured since you
probably weren't going to buy

16:11.679 --> 16:13.222
a present for your dad...

16:13.305 --> 16:15.265
Look, I appreciate
what you're doing here,

16:15.349 --> 16:17.851
but it's a lost cause.

16:17.935 --> 16:20.437
It's your father.

16:22.314 --> 16:23.774
{\an1}Why don't you
forget about this

16:23.857 --> 16:25.234
and go have some lunch, okay?

16:25.317 --> 16:27.403
Okay.

16:27.486 --> 16:28.696
Yeah, that sounds good.

16:28.779 --> 16:31.031
All right.
Okay.

16:31.115 --> 16:33.075
I'll wait for you outside.

16:40.791 --> 16:42.876
(speed-dialing tone)

16:42.960 --> 16:44.586
(phone ringing through)

16:44.670 --> 16:46.714
Hello.
Mrs. Hunter?

16:46.797 --> 16:48.132
Yes.

16:48.215 --> 16:50.092
Hi. This is Donna Martin.
I'm Noah's girlfriend.

16:50.175 --> 16:51.802
Yes, of course.
Hello.

16:51.885 --> 16:55.097
Um, yeah, about Mr. Hunter's
birthday dinner tomorrow night.

16:55.180 --> 16:57.224
Turns out we're going to be able
to make it after all.

16:57.307 --> 16:58.934
That's wonderful, Donna.
Yeah.

16:59.017 --> 16:59.768
We're looking forward to it.

16:59.852 --> 17:01.061
Looking forward
to meeting you, too.

17:01.145 --> 17:02.813
Until then.
Bye.

17:06.525 --> 17:08.609
DAVID:
<i>Acne medicine?</i>

17:08.694 --> 17:10.112
It's a national spot, baby.

17:10.194 --> 17:12.156
Great.

17:12.239 --> 17:13.699
{\an3}For a second there,
I was worried

17:13.781 --> 17:16.076
{\an3}I'd only be suffering
regional embarrassment.

17:16.160 --> 17:18.078
{\an1}It's a job like all
the others, big Dave.

17:18.162 --> 17:19.872
{\an1}Paper.

17:19.954 --> 17:23.291
Look, I really appreciate
the work you've given me.

17:23.375 --> 17:27.421
So it's a done deal.
No, it's not.

17:27.503 --> 17:28.922
You trying to tell me something?

17:29.006 --> 17:33.510
Like I said,
I really appreciate the work.

17:33.594 --> 17:35.596
It's just not what
I want to be doing.

17:35.679 --> 17:38.015
{\an1}I know that. You want
to be doing movie scores.

17:38.098 --> 17:40.809
{\an3}Exactly. I heard you've
got one in postproduction.

17:40.893 --> 17:43.687
Right, right, and I'm looking
for a composer.

17:43.771 --> 17:45.814
But you don't have
the experience.

17:45.898 --> 17:49.526
I can't get the job
if I don't have any experience,

17:49.610 --> 17:51.987
but I can't get
the experience

17:52.070 --> 17:53.530
if I don't get the job.

17:53.614 --> 17:55.115
Look, David, sincerely,
I'm really sorry.

17:55.199 --> 17:56.325
I mean, I mean that.

17:56.408 --> 17:57.785
But I just don't think
you're ready.

17:57.868 --> 17:59.161
{\an1}I'm offering you
this commercial, man.

17:59.244 --> 18:00.954
That's what I have
for you right now.

18:01.038 --> 18:04.416
Fine-- if I can do a song
for the movie.

18:04.500 --> 18:06.293
What about your participation
in the movie

18:06.376 --> 18:07.920
didn't I make clear?

18:08.003 --> 18:08.962
Nothing.

18:09.046 --> 18:10.672
But to be honest,

18:10.756 --> 18:12.841
I'm too good
to be doing jingles.

18:12.925 --> 18:16.553
Is that right? Well, I suggest
you don't write them anymore.

18:16.637 --> 18:20.015
Fine. Acne medicine
sounds great.

18:20.098 --> 18:22.226
No, I don't think
it's a good idea.

18:22.309 --> 18:23.936
I wouldn't want you
to stoop so low.

18:30.943 --> 18:33.570
{\an1}All I'm saying is that
when you are ready,

18:33.654 --> 18:35.447
they're going to be
lined up six deep.

18:35.531 --> 18:37.366
Oh, that is
such a comfort.

18:37.449 --> 18:38.659
And until you're ready, work.

18:38.742 --> 18:39.618
It's a great distraction.

18:39.701 --> 18:43.539
Oh, for a broken heart?
I never thought so.

18:43.622 --> 18:45.499
Not that your heart's broken.

18:46.750 --> 18:49.002
Did I mention that the buyer
loved your dress?

18:49.086 --> 18:50.045
No. That's great.

18:50.128 --> 18:53.382
Yeah, and, uh, he wants to
display it at Rudman's.

18:53.465 --> 18:55.259
Really? My dress?

18:55.342 --> 18:57.511
I mean, if that's okay with you.

18:57.594 --> 19:00.639
Sure. It's fine.

19:05.435 --> 19:08.355
{\an5}DAVID:
So you're saying
you were too young.

19:08.438 --> 19:12.192
{\an5}BRANDON:
Having to consult
on every choice, every move---

19:12.276 --> 19:13.861
I just...
I wasn't ready for it.

19:13.944 --> 19:16.071
Sounds like you got out
just in time, you know.

19:16.154 --> 19:18.240
{\an3}Funny I didn't hear you say
that before we called it off.

19:18.323 --> 19:19.700
Brandon,
we're friends.

19:19.783 --> 19:21.368
We're supposed to tell you
what you want to hear.

19:21.451 --> 19:22.536
{\an1}That's right.
Right?

19:22.619 --> 19:23.412
Right.
Yeah.

19:23.495 --> 19:25.205
I mean, it's not
just the age thing.

19:25.289 --> 19:27.749
{\an3}Kelly and I... we're
too much alike, you know?

19:27.833 --> 19:30.085
{\an3}We're like, we're like
the same half of a circle.

19:30.168 --> 19:32.087
{\an5}Oh, come on.
We don't complete
each other.

19:32.170 --> 19:33.630
{\an3}You know, I hear
what you're saying,

19:33.714 --> 19:35.090
but circles
and choices?

19:35.173 --> 19:36.925
{\an3}Okay, she's
beautiful, right?

19:37.009 --> 19:38.427
{\an3}She's smart.
Mm-hmm.

19:38.510 --> 19:39.803
{\an3}She's sexy.
And I love her,

19:39.887 --> 19:41.305
{\an3}but marriage was
like this huge thing

19:41.388 --> 19:42.848
{\an3}that was swallowing
us whole.

19:42.931 --> 19:44.349
So take the marriage
out of the equation,

19:44.433 --> 19:45.434
{\an3}and things
will be cool.

19:45.517 --> 19:48.604
Take the fact that
I proposed out of the equation

19:48.687 --> 19:49.980
{\an3}and the fact
that she accepted.

19:50.063 --> 19:52.274
The fact that we
sent out invitations.

19:52.357 --> 19:54.776
The dress, the minister,
the string quartet,

19:54.860 --> 19:56.278
the honeymoon
reservations--

19:56.361 --> 19:58.739
if you take all of those things
out of the equation,

19:58.822 --> 20:00.908
yeah, yeah, we're cool.

20:00.991 --> 20:03.577
{\an1}So, Steve, you and Sarah
up next or what?

20:03.660 --> 20:05.454
No, no,
we're through.

20:05.537 --> 20:06.622
After all your
obsessing?

20:06.705 --> 20:08.290
{\an3}I thought she was
the one, buddy.

20:08.373 --> 20:10.167
Well, she was--
yesterday.

20:10.250 --> 20:11.460
Oh, beautiful.

20:11.543 --> 20:12.836
That was before
I met Sophie.

20:12.920 --> 20:14.129
{\an6}Sophie.
Why am I
not surprised?

20:14.212 --> 20:15.464
Oh, wait till
you hear this.

20:15.547 --> 20:17.299
{\an1}It will make you feel better
about you and Kelly.

20:17.382 --> 20:18.467
{\an3}I didn't realize
I was feeling badly.

20:18.550 --> 20:20.093
Not like that.
Oh.

20:20.177 --> 20:21.929
{\an3}Is this going to be
like a bedtime story?

20:22.012 --> 20:23.263
We're at the store
the other day...

20:23.347 --> 20:24.598
I'm getting tired.
(all laugh)

20:24.681 --> 20:26.099
{\an4}STEVE:
Come on, we're the store
the other day,

20:26.183 --> 20:27.726
returning those gifts...

20:32.105 --> 20:34.983
{\an1}Wow, cruising so soon?
I'm impressed.

20:35.067 --> 20:36.485
Val, please don't do this.

20:36.568 --> 20:38.654
Well, I'm glad you're moving on.

20:38.737 --> 20:39.780
That's an understatement.

20:39.863 --> 20:40.989
For your sake.

20:41.073 --> 20:43.283
Our Val-- always thinking
of others.

20:43.367 --> 20:44.826
Yeah, usually
with a big old knife

20:44.910 --> 20:46.453
sticking out of their back.

20:46.536 --> 20:47.829
{\an6}VALERIE:
The reason why I'm glad
you're moving on

20:47.913 --> 20:49.206
is because I didn't think
you could.

20:49.289 --> 20:50.791
{\an1}I figured you couldn't
make it work with Brandon,

20:50.874 --> 20:53.043
that you couldn't make it
work with anybody.

20:53.126 --> 20:54.378
For your sake,

20:54.461 --> 20:55.504
I hope I'm wrong.

20:58.590 --> 21:00.634
Ignore her.
She just wants to gloat.

21:00.717 --> 21:02.219
What if she's right?
She's not.

21:02.302 --> 21:03.345
What if she is?

21:05.597 --> 21:06.848
(sighs)

21:06.932 --> 21:08.350
Hi. You want to dance?

21:08.433 --> 21:10.519
I don't think so.

21:10.602 --> 21:12.020
But you're not sure.

21:12.104 --> 21:15.065
Actually, I, uh,
have a boyfriend.

21:24.074 --> 21:25.659
Is that incredible,
or what?

21:25.742 --> 21:27.244
{\an1}Yeah, real damsel
in distress.

21:27.327 --> 21:28.745
{\an3}Yeah, knight in a
shiny Corvette.

21:28.829 --> 21:30.247
No melodrama
there, right?

21:30.330 --> 21:32.207
{\an3}Sounds like a perfectly,
wonderfully screwed-up way

21:32.290 --> 21:33.500
{\an3}to start
a relationship.

21:33.583 --> 21:34.376
No, you're missing
the point.

21:34.459 --> 21:35.460
We got the point.

21:35.544 --> 21:36.128
{\an1}The point is,
you're a lunatic.

21:36.211 --> 21:37.796
Guys, love
is replaceable.

21:37.879 --> 21:38.839
{\an3}And that's
a good thing?

21:38.922 --> 21:41.341
{\an1}If you fall in love
every day like he does, yeah.

21:41.425 --> 21:42.634
He's lost his mind.

21:42.718 --> 21:44.261
{\an3}(grunts)

21:44.344 --> 21:46.763
{\an3}STEVE:
Let's hit it.

21:46.847 --> 21:48.807
{\an3}STEVE:
You all right?

21:50.475 --> 21:51.727
Yeah.

22:00.152 --> 22:02.988
{\an1}We made things
worse, didn't we?

22:04.656 --> 22:06.408
No.

22:06.491 --> 22:09.286
No, it's just...

22:09.369 --> 22:13.415
{\an6}(sighs):
I was supposed to be unpacking
this on my honeymoon.

22:14.708 --> 22:16.585
I know.

22:20.505 --> 22:21.631
(sniffles)

22:23.717 --> 22:25.677
{\an5}STEVE (on video):
I'm almost done
with the lettering.

22:25.761 --> 22:27.095
{\an5}KELLY:
And I didn't think
the word "married"

22:27.179 --> 22:28.472
was in your vocabulary, Steve.

22:28.555 --> 22:29.973
{\an5}STEVE:
I'll have Brandon
do a spell-check.

22:30.057 --> 22:31.016
NOAH:
Cans are ready.

22:31.099 --> 22:32.350
DONNA:
Ribbon-- yes or no?

22:32.434 --> 22:33.977
{\an5}Is that gonna
embarrass him?
Absolutely.

22:34.061 --> 22:35.771
Let's go with
the ribbons, then.

22:35.854 --> 22:37.564
NOAH:
Well, that's gonna burn

22:37.647 --> 22:38.607
right through the paint, man.

22:38.690 --> 22:41.151
{\an5}STEVE:
But if it does,
it means it'll be there

22:41.234 --> 22:43.612
forever--
just like them.

22:43.695 --> 22:47.074
{\an5}NOAH:
All right. (chuckles)
Whoo!

22:49.159 --> 22:51.536
...it means it'll be there
forever-- just like them.

22:52.954 --> 22:56.541
{\an5}NOAH:
All right. (chuckles)
Whoo!

23:04.382 --> 23:06.593
{\an5}NOAH:
<i>I-I can't believe</i>
<i>you told her we'd go.</i>

23:06.676 --> 23:07.969
She was thrilled.

23:08.053 --> 23:09.638
I asked you not to.

23:09.721 --> 23:11.640
{\an3}Like, your parents
are difficult.

23:11.723 --> 23:13.475
I understand--
so's my mother.

23:13.558 --> 23:14.643
There's no comparison here.

23:14.726 --> 23:15.936
Then what, a-are
you embarrassed

23:16.019 --> 23:17.312
{\an3}to introduce me
or something?

23:17.395 --> 23:18.605
Is that what you think?

23:18.688 --> 23:20.774
(sighs):
I don't know.

23:20.857 --> 23:21.942
Let me tell you what it's like

23:22.025 --> 23:22.901
growing up
in the Hunter household.

23:22.984 --> 23:23.985
You're up by 6:00,

23:24.069 --> 23:26.822
your chores done by 6:30,
breakfast served by 7:30--

23:26.905 --> 23:28.031
you miss it,

23:28.115 --> 23:29.116
you go without.

23:29.199 --> 23:31.284
Dinner served by 6:00.

23:31.368 --> 23:33.161
You miss grace, you go without.

23:33.245 --> 23:35.122
You speak only when spoken to,

23:35.205 --> 23:37.415
and lights are
always out at 9:00.

23:37.499 --> 23:39.543
And I mean always.

23:39.626 --> 23:40.669
That's my father's commandments.

23:40.752 --> 23:42.546
I didn't buy into it,
so I left.

23:42.629 --> 23:44.339
Let me help you.

24:00.272 --> 24:01.356
(chuckles):
Well, it's all set-- you're in.

24:01.439 --> 24:02.524
{\an1}Really?

24:02.607 --> 24:03.984
Yeah. I would've
told you last night,

24:04.067 --> 24:06.069
but we got home so late,
you were already sleeping.

24:06.153 --> 24:07.487
(laughs):
Yeah.

24:07.571 --> 24:09.906
Nice T-shirt.

24:09.990 --> 24:11.700
Thanks.
Hey, I feel really bad

24:11.783 --> 24:13.368
about putting you on the couch.

24:13.451 --> 24:15.203
I'm just glad it worked out.

24:15.287 --> 24:16.371
Thanks to you.

24:16.454 --> 24:17.664
Well, what do you say

24:17.747 --> 24:18.874
we celebrate over breakfast?

24:18.957 --> 24:20.542
Sure. I'll be right down.

24:20.625 --> 24:23.253
Okay.

24:25.297 --> 24:27.424
(exhales)

24:43.523 --> 24:45.358
(scoffs):
He fired you?

24:45.442 --> 24:48.570
Not right away-- I had to
tell him how great I was first.

24:48.653 --> 24:51.948
Wow. I'm really sorry.

24:52.032 --> 24:54.910
{\an3}But you did
the right thing.

24:54.993 --> 24:57.078
No, I did what
you suggested.

24:57.162 --> 25:00.457
Well, he's an idiot for not
letting you score his movie.

25:00.540 --> 25:04.377
{\an5}(sighs):
He's an idiot that's producing
movies and commercials.

25:04.461 --> 25:07.088
{\an3}Well, the important thing
is that you told the truth.

25:07.172 --> 25:09.257
No, I was fired, Val--
that's the important thing.

25:09.341 --> 25:10.926
What, you're acting
like it's my fault.

25:11.009 --> 25:13.220
No, no.
You gave me bad advice.

25:13.303 --> 25:16.056
It was my fault
for listening to it.

25:20.352 --> 25:21.436
{\an3}(calls):
Sanders?

25:21.519 --> 25:23.438
At your service.
Last night I'm watching

25:23.521 --> 25:25.106
{\an3}my wedding video
in the living room.

25:25.190 --> 25:27.108
{\an3}Then you go to sleep
on the couch.

25:27.192 --> 25:29.069
The wedding video's now
mysteriously taped over.

25:29.152 --> 25:30.237
Would you care to explain?

25:30.320 --> 25:31.238
Not at all.

25:31.321 --> 25:32.614
{\an3}Please try.

25:32.697 --> 25:34.783
{\an1}All right, it's 3:00
in the morning,

25:34.866 --> 25:37.953
and there I am, channel surfing,
and what do I find?

25:38.036 --> 25:40.163
The seniors tournament.
Mm.

25:40.247 --> 25:42.165
And it's, you know,
late, and I figured

25:42.249 --> 25:45.126
I wasn't gonna stay up to watch
the whole thing, and I, um...

25:45.210 --> 25:46.419
I taped it.

25:46.503 --> 25:47.796
Senior golf?

25:47.879 --> 25:49.464
Yeah, it was in
the middle of the night.

25:49.548 --> 25:51.132
{\an3}You taped over
my wedding video

25:51.216 --> 25:52.634
{\an3}for a seniors
golf tournament?

25:52.717 --> 25:54.261
Brandon, it's one of the majors.

25:54.344 --> 25:57.305
(chuckles):
Okay, I'm sorry.

25:57.389 --> 25:59.140
I feel terrible.

25:59.224 --> 26:01.101
You shouldn't.

26:01.184 --> 26:02.602
Do you mind?

26:02.686 --> 26:04.479
Don't blame Steve
for your mistake.

26:04.562 --> 26:06.273
I don't watch
seniors golf.

26:06.356 --> 26:07.941
Look, this is not about a tape.

26:08.024 --> 26:10.485
This is about memories, memories
you would have had with Kelly

26:10.568 --> 26:11.653
if you would've gotten married.

26:11.736 --> 26:12.612
Hey, Val...

26:12.696 --> 26:13.822
Look, tape or no tape,

26:13.905 --> 26:15.615
you can't get back
what you had with her.

26:15.699 --> 26:17.367
{\an3}Would you go be a bitch
somewhere, please?

26:18.410 --> 26:19.911
Okay.

26:21.204 --> 26:24.291
(sighs):
I'm really sorry, Brandon.

26:24.374 --> 26:27.252
Well, forget it.

26:30.255 --> 26:33.008
{\an5}DONNA:
Wait, we haven't returned
all the gifts yet.

26:33.091 --> 26:34.634
We can do it later.

26:34.718 --> 26:37.846
{\an1}Kel, are you sure
you want to do this?

26:37.929 --> 26:39.014
No.

26:39.097 --> 26:41.099
Then don't.

26:43.768 --> 26:45.895
Kel.

26:51.818 --> 26:54.988
{\an5}KELLY:
Brandon and I were supposed
to go through life together.

26:55.071 --> 26:57.407
{\an3}He was supposed
to be my partner.

26:59.117 --> 27:00.618
I know.

27:00.702 --> 27:03.872
{\an1}But you're gonna
find someone else.

27:03.955 --> 27:06.374
What if I don't?

27:06.458 --> 27:09.169
What if he was the one?

27:09.252 --> 27:11.921
{\an1}Then you would
have married him.

27:14.090 --> 27:17.385
KELLY:
I want it back.

27:17.469 --> 27:19.220
It's just a dress.

27:19.304 --> 27:21.181
Not just the dress.

27:21.264 --> 27:23.350
The day, everything.

27:24.476 --> 27:27.354
I want it all back.

27:32.359 --> 27:34.569
Here we are.
Can I buy you a drink?

27:34.652 --> 27:36.404
Oh, no, this
one's on me.

27:36.488 --> 27:38.281
Okay. Beer's fine.
Okay.

27:38.365 --> 27:41.201
{\an5}You know what?
I'll get us a table.
Okay.

27:46.873 --> 27:48.124
Hi.

27:48.208 --> 27:49.250
Two beers, please?

27:49.334 --> 27:52.545
That, uh, that'll be eight even.

27:52.629 --> 27:54.255
Change a fifty?

27:54.964 --> 27:56.591
Yeah.

27:59.677 --> 28:01.596
You mean change a ten.

28:01.679 --> 28:04.099
Whoops. I must have
made a mistake.

28:04.182 --> 28:05.725
Yeah, must have.

28:05.809 --> 28:06.768
{\an3}So, uh,

28:06.851 --> 28:07.644
you try that often,

28:07.727 --> 28:09.562
or do I just look
especially stupid?

28:09.646 --> 28:12.023
I think you look great.

28:15.110 --> 28:17.320
{\an4}Got us a table
right up front.
Great.

28:17.404 --> 28:18.738
I see you two have met.

28:18.822 --> 28:20.615
Sophie Burns.
David Silver.

28:20.698 --> 28:22.700
{\an1}David Silver--
you did that song.

28:25.036 --> 28:27.288
Um, I got to get back to work.

28:27.372 --> 28:28.581
Have a good one.

28:28.665 --> 28:29.582
See you, buddy.

28:29.666 --> 28:30.959
Come on, follow me.

28:31.042 --> 28:32.877
Excuse me.

28:39.551 --> 28:40.927
(exhales)

28:45.515 --> 28:48.768
I understand your father
is a respected surgeon.

28:48.852 --> 28:50.478
He was; he's retired now.

28:50.562 --> 28:52.730
And Noah tells me that
you have your own business.

28:52.814 --> 28:53.940
Do we have to quiz her?

28:54.023 --> 28:55.608
Well, no point in owning

28:55.692 --> 28:56.651
your own business anymore,

28:56.734 --> 28:59.362
not with government regulators
and the damn IRS.

28:59.446 --> 29:01.990
Uh, more lamb?

29:02.073 --> 29:03.158
No, thank you.

29:03.241 --> 29:04.325
It was wonderful.

29:04.409 --> 29:06.119
{\an3}In the old days,
the government

29:06.202 --> 29:08.788
used to stay out of it,
let a man pursue his dream.

29:08.872 --> 29:09.998
Even if that dream ruined
the environment, right?

29:10.081 --> 29:11.916
The oil and chemical
companies never met

29:12.000 --> 29:13.710
{\an3}a clean water bill
they couldn't oppose.

29:13.793 --> 29:17.088
Business built this country.
No, people built this country.

29:17.172 --> 29:21.050
Business just got rich off it.
(sighs)

29:21.134 --> 29:24.679
I think your father's gonna love
his birthday present, don't you?

29:24.762 --> 29:27.515
Yeah, his present, right.

29:27.599 --> 29:29.058
Happy birthday.

29:29.142 --> 29:30.685
You shouldn't have.
I didn't.

29:33.146 --> 29:34.731
You know, when Noah
was a little boy,

29:34.814 --> 29:36.024
he used to love

29:36.107 --> 29:38.151
fixing my afternoon cocktail.

29:38.234 --> 29:40.028
One finger of gin
after a good day;

29:40.111 --> 29:41.362
two fingers after a bad one.

29:41.446 --> 29:43.364
And three when he wanted
to take it out on us.

29:43.448 --> 29:44.866
You can only imagine

29:44.949 --> 29:49.037
how I feel knowing how
instrumental I was in launching

29:49.120 --> 29:51.331
his so-called career.

30:02.425 --> 30:03.551
(music playing inside club)

30:03.635 --> 30:05.386
{\an3}You're in over
your head.

30:05.470 --> 30:06.763
Mm, I hope so.

30:06.846 --> 30:08.348
{\an6}VALERIE:
Trust me-- you may
be here with her,

30:08.431 --> 30:09.432
but she isn't
here with you.

30:09.516 --> 30:11.726
{\an1}Like you didn't see her
sleeping in my bed last night?

30:11.809 --> 30:13.728
I saw it, but I also
saw you on the couch.

30:13.811 --> 30:15.230
Yeah, for now.

30:15.313 --> 30:17.524
She's gonna hurt you.

30:17.607 --> 30:19.859
{\an1}I can take care of myself,
Valerie, thanks.

30:19.943 --> 30:21.736
{\an3}Well, you're
gonna have to.

30:21.819 --> 30:23.071
Two beers.

30:23.154 --> 30:25.907
And on behalf of Val's
evil twin, an apology.

30:25.990 --> 30:27.742
{\an3}Fine, don't
listen to me.

30:27.825 --> 30:29.702
{\an3}But don't blame me when
she rips through you.

30:29.786 --> 30:32.539
And on that supportive note...

30:32.622 --> 30:34.123
Thanks, David.

30:36.125 --> 30:37.877
{\an1}(sighs):
Well... let's see.

30:37.961 --> 30:40.088
{\an1}So far your dedication
to the truth

30:40.171 --> 30:42.257
has managed to cost me my job,

30:42.340 --> 30:44.968
{\an1}and insult, annoy
and generally piss off

30:45.051 --> 30:48.429
Kelly, Nat and Steve.

30:48.513 --> 30:49.764
Nice.

30:49.847 --> 30:52.559
Did you prefer it when I lied?
No.

30:52.642 --> 30:54.936
Then how come you can get angry
with me when I tell the truth?

30:55.019 --> 30:57.605
Because, Val, you're using
the truth like you use lies--

30:57.689 --> 30:58.565
to push people away.

30:58.648 --> 31:00.316
{\an1}Instead of opening
yourself up with honesty,

31:00.400 --> 31:02.610
you club people
over the head with it.

31:02.694 --> 31:03.945
Well, people get
what they deserve.

31:04.028 --> 31:05.238
Everyone except you.

31:05.321 --> 31:07.156
Especially me.

31:07.240 --> 31:09.200
What'd you do
that was so horrible?

31:09.284 --> 31:11.119
{\an4}You have no idea.
Was it
really so bad

31:11.202 --> 31:13.079
that you don't deserve
to test negative?

31:13.162 --> 31:15.290
{\an1}To have people
close to you

31:15.373 --> 31:17.166
have any joy in your life?

31:17.875 --> 31:19.335
Yeah.

31:19.419 --> 31:21.588
What was it?

31:21.671 --> 31:23.798
It was nothing.

31:23.881 --> 31:25.800
It's not gonna
change anything, Val.

31:25.883 --> 31:27.302
Look, I said it was nothing,

31:27.385 --> 31:29.012
{\an3}okay?

31:34.225 --> 31:36.811
(knock on door)

31:37.854 --> 31:40.273
{\an3}Why did you agree
to not get married?

31:40.356 --> 31:42.775
{\an1}I thought we were
getting married

31:42.859 --> 31:45.278
{\an1}because we were supposed to,
not because we wanted to.

31:45.361 --> 31:47.322
{\an3}And now you think
differently?

31:47.405 --> 31:50.992
{\an1}If you came here to remind me
that you've moved on...

31:51.075 --> 31:52.785
I didn't.

31:52.869 --> 31:54.621
And I haven't.

31:59.751 --> 32:02.128
The other night was a mistake.

32:02.211 --> 32:03.338
This is different.

32:03.421 --> 32:05.006
Why are you here?

32:05.089 --> 32:06.507
Because this
isn't easy.

32:06.591 --> 32:09.302
Because I'm scared.

32:09.385 --> 32:11.387
So am I.

32:23.483 --> 32:26.027
<i>Bel Age Hotel room service.</i>
SOPHIE: <i> Hello. I'd like to order</i>

32:26.110 --> 32:27.362
room service, please.

32:27.445 --> 32:29.697
Yes, room 568.

32:29.781 --> 32:32.867
Yes, I would like
two egg white omelets, please,

32:32.950 --> 32:35.119
um, two orders
of whole wheat toast,

32:35.203 --> 32:37.538
two large glasses
of orange juice, coffee,

32:37.622 --> 32:39.082
and...

32:39.165 --> 32:41.042
{\an1}your most
expensive caviar,

32:41.125 --> 32:42.710
and your very best
bottle of champagne.

32:42.794 --> 32:44.879
Okay.
Yes, and could you just leave it

32:44.962 --> 32:46.714
outside the door, please?
My husband is sleeping,

32:46.798 --> 32:48.716
and I really don't want
to disturb him.

32:48.800 --> 32:50.301
Very good, ma'am.
Great.

32:50.385 --> 32:52.720
Thank you. Bye.

32:52.804 --> 32:54.430
(chuckles)

32:54.514 --> 32:56.974
{\an3}Nice trick-- the hotel
room service scam.

32:57.058 --> 32:58.893
I'm surprised
I haven't thought of it.

32:58.976 --> 33:00.937
Victimless crime.
(giggles)

33:01.020 --> 33:02.355
Unlike your others.

33:03.648 --> 33:05.608
Don't hurt Steve, okay?

33:05.692 --> 33:07.902
I have no intention
of hurting him.

33:07.985 --> 33:09.654
Accidents happen.

33:11.989 --> 33:13.908
Tell me about David.

33:13.991 --> 33:16.369
He's not available.

33:16.452 --> 33:18.246
Oh, well,
he seemed available last night.

33:18.329 --> 33:20.957
Well, he's not. So you
can cancel the caviar.

33:21.040 --> 33:23.960
Look, if I'm stepping
on toes here...

33:24.043 --> 33:25.211
I'll step right back.

33:26.504 --> 33:28.256
We clear?

33:28.339 --> 33:29.507
Very.

33:38.516 --> 33:40.601
KELLY:
This is nice.

33:40.685 --> 33:42.687
BRANDON:
Yeah.

33:44.814 --> 33:49.902
After the wedding, it felt like
we were together to say goodbye,

33:49.986 --> 33:52.739
but last night,
holding each other,

33:52.822 --> 33:55.283
it just felt so much more...

33:55.366 --> 33:57.076
{\an1}Intimate.

33:57.160 --> 34:00.955
Yeah. And gentle
and loving.

34:01.038 --> 34:03.791
Promise you won't laugh.

34:03.875 --> 34:05.918
I promise.

34:08.920 --> 34:11.174
I think we should go
on our honeymoon.

34:11.257 --> 34:13.592
I'm not laughing.

34:13.676 --> 34:15.969
We've got the tickets.
Why don't we just use them?

34:16.053 --> 34:17.472
We didn't get married.

34:17.554 --> 34:18.931
But we're here.

34:19.014 --> 34:20.141
We're together.

34:20.224 --> 34:21.641
Maybe we should
just give it a go.

34:21.726 --> 34:23.268
You sure that's what you want?

34:23.351 --> 34:24.562
Yeah.

34:24.645 --> 34:26.731
Are you?

35:05.770 --> 35:08.564
(knocking at door)

35:13.820 --> 35:14.987
Breakfast is served.

35:19.617 --> 35:20.868
Uh, did I miss something?

35:20.952 --> 35:23.663
{\an1}It's just my way
of saying I'm sorry

35:23.746 --> 35:25.206
about last night.

35:25.289 --> 35:27.542
Oh, well,
it's completely unnecessary.

35:27.625 --> 35:29.043
{\an1}Maybe.

35:29.126 --> 35:30.378
But you never know.

35:30.461 --> 35:32.547
Might be fun.

35:32.630 --> 35:33.589
{\an3}Yeah.

35:33.673 --> 35:35.508
{\an1}(giggles)

35:35.591 --> 35:37.718
{\an1}So...

35:37.802 --> 35:40.304
an apology...

35:40.388 --> 35:41.430
{\an1}and...

35:43.182 --> 35:46.018
...a toast.

35:46.102 --> 35:47.228
To a fresh start.

35:47.311 --> 35:49.230
Does Steve know you're here?

35:49.313 --> 35:50.940
(chuckles)

35:51.023 --> 35:53.109
Steve is my friend,
nothing more.

35:53.192 --> 35:54.569
Are you sure he knows that?

35:54.652 --> 35:55.862
Absolutely.

36:05.705 --> 36:07.248
Brandon, of course you do.

36:07.331 --> 36:08.583
Or you could just
rip her heart out

36:08.666 --> 36:09.876
{\an3}and spare yourself
the jet lag.

36:09.959 --> 36:10.918
Kelly wants
to give us a chance.

36:11.002 --> 36:11.961
{\an3}She doesn't want
to be alone.

36:12.044 --> 36:13.170
Neither do I.

36:13.254 --> 36:15.423
{\an3}Well, go to a Dodger game or
get on a bus during rush hour.

36:15.506 --> 36:16.465
Just don't lead her on.

36:16.549 --> 36:17.633
DAVID: Guys?
Come on. Hey.

36:17.717 --> 36:19.260
{\an3}Finally,
the voice of reason.

36:19.343 --> 36:20.469
David, should I go
to Corsica with Kelly?

36:20.553 --> 36:23.723
Their entire relationship hangs
on your answer, by the way.

36:23.806 --> 36:25.474
But no pressure.

36:27.143 --> 36:28.436
Forget I asked.

36:28.519 --> 36:29.562
Brandon.

36:29.645 --> 36:30.980
{\an3}Hey, Steve,
you got a sec?

36:31.063 --> 36:32.231
Yeah. What's up?

36:32.315 --> 36:33.274
Uh, it's about Sophie.

36:33.357 --> 36:35.151
Mmm. That saucy redhead, huh?

36:35.234 --> 36:36.277
She's unbelievable.

36:36.360 --> 36:38.404
Eh. That's kind of what I
want to talk to you about.

36:38.487 --> 36:39.739
{\an1}Well, if you were thinking
of asking her out,

36:39.822 --> 36:41.991
{\an1}I hate to tell you,
but the boat's already sailed.

36:42.074 --> 36:43.993
Sure about that?
Yeah.

36:44.076 --> 36:46.162
{\an3}Cool, man. That's all
I needed to hear.

36:46.245 --> 36:47.997
{\an1}Hey, Dave.

36:48.080 --> 36:49.624
Thanks a lot for checking.

36:49.707 --> 36:51.292
That's a real
stand-up thing to do.

36:52.501 --> 36:53.920
You're cool like that, man.

36:58.758 --> 37:00.676
{\an1}Glen thought the dress
would generate interest,

37:00.760 --> 37:02.803
but not this much.

37:02.887 --> 37:04.013
So, let me get this right.
The new order's official?

37:04.096 --> 37:05.306
As of an hour ago.

37:05.389 --> 37:06.474
Soon, I'll be on the racks

37:06.557 --> 37:07.934
of Rudman's bridal department.

37:08.017 --> 37:08.935
I'm happy for you.

37:09.018 --> 37:11.145
Thank you.
(chuckles)

37:11.228 --> 37:12.980
You lost?

37:13.064 --> 37:15.149
Business seems good.

37:15.232 --> 37:17.985
High volume.
Low overhead.

37:18.069 --> 37:19.987
It's great. What do you want?

37:20.071 --> 37:21.280
A drink.

37:22.406 --> 37:24.325
May I?

37:24.408 --> 37:26.619
{\an3}Oh, please.

37:26.702 --> 37:28.496
Must be three fingers,
otherwise you wouldn't be here.

37:28.579 --> 37:30.248
Has it been that awful?

37:30.331 --> 37:31.874
If there was some failure you
forgot to mention last night,

37:31.958 --> 37:33.042
make it quick.

37:33.125 --> 37:34.418
I got a lot of work to do.

37:34.502 --> 37:35.544
Well, there was, yes.

37:35.628 --> 37:38.381
{\an1}But it was mine,
not yours.

37:38.464 --> 37:41.217
{\an3}Maybe I should
leave you two alone.

37:41.300 --> 37:42.385
Oh, no, I want you to stay.

37:42.468 --> 37:44.887
An apology
would be historic right now.

37:44.971 --> 37:46.806
And I want a witness.

37:46.889 --> 37:50.059
Well... you wanted me
to make it quick, so here it is.

37:50.142 --> 37:52.436
We're broke.

37:57.483 --> 37:59.860
You hear what I said?
We're wiped out.

38:01.112 --> 38:03.072
Well, how's that possible?

38:03.155 --> 38:06.701
We've been in dispute
with the IRS for many years.

38:06.784 --> 38:09.328
The settlement agreement
levied such high fines,

38:09.412 --> 38:11.706
the company's being forced
into bankruptcy.

38:11.789 --> 38:14.041
Well, what about your assets?
I mean, you weren't covered?

38:14.125 --> 38:15.084
(wry chuckle)

38:15.167 --> 38:16.794
Our assets, like your trust,

38:16.877 --> 38:19.088
consisted almost solely
of stock in the company.

38:19.171 --> 38:21.549
And now the stock's worthless.

38:21.632 --> 38:23.217
And so are we.

38:31.851 --> 38:35.104
(tentative knocking at door)

38:35.187 --> 38:38.065
Hi.
Hi.

38:38.149 --> 38:39.734
Come on in.

38:39.817 --> 38:41.569
(sighs)

38:41.652 --> 38:43.654
I-I can't do it.

38:44.989 --> 38:48.909
{\an3}Last night was different
and everything, but...

38:48.993 --> 38:50.745
It's just not enough.

38:50.828 --> 38:52.079
But you came to me.

38:52.163 --> 38:54.457
I was scared.
After I told you how I felt?

38:54.540 --> 38:56.250
I wanted to feel the same way.

38:56.333 --> 38:57.752
You needed comforting
and I gave it to you.

38:57.835 --> 39:01.255
{\an1}Well, I need comforting now,
Brandon, and tomorrow

39:01.338 --> 39:03.591
and the day after that. Who's
going to give it to me then?

39:03.674 --> 39:05.051
Kelly...

39:05.134 --> 39:06.719
Can't you see we're just
holding on to each other

39:06.802 --> 39:08.262
because we're scared to move on?

39:08.346 --> 39:10.389
{\an3}Calling off the wedding
was the easy part.

39:10.473 --> 39:12.266
It's getting on with our
lives that's difficult.

39:12.349 --> 39:13.601
But that's what you want to do.

39:13.684 --> 39:14.769
(sighs)

39:14.852 --> 39:15.770
I don't know.

39:15.853 --> 39:17.980
I deserve a better answer
than that, Brandon!

39:18.064 --> 39:19.231
{\an3}I'm sorry,

39:19.315 --> 39:22.276
but yeah. Yeah,
that's what I want.

39:27.323 --> 39:28.657
(slamming)

39:51.889 --> 39:53.933
(sniffles)

40:01.107 --> 40:03.109
{\an3}Hey, Val. Why don't
you come on in?

40:03.192 --> 40:04.527
You want the truth?

40:04.610 --> 40:06.487
No. Not if you're going
to bludgeon me with it.

40:06.570 --> 40:07.530
The truth is...

40:07.613 --> 40:09.115
is that I'm miserable.

40:11.742 --> 40:12.701
{\an3}Wow.

40:12.785 --> 40:15.162
You don't waste any time,
do you?

40:16.288 --> 40:18.499
I guess you and Sophie
have that in common.

40:20.251 --> 40:22.294
Okay, Val.

40:23.879 --> 40:25.214
Let me help you.

40:25.297 --> 40:28.050
I love you, David.

40:28.134 --> 40:29.635
And you don't love me.

40:29.718 --> 40:32.680
{\an3}Steve wants Sophie.
Sophie wants you.

40:32.763 --> 40:34.765
Brandon doesn't want Kelly.
Kelly wants Brandon.

40:34.849 --> 40:36.350
What's the secret, Val?

40:36.433 --> 40:37.601
No.
Tell me.

40:37.685 --> 40:40.521
No, Because when I'm honest
with you, you get angry with me

40:40.604 --> 40:42.022
for being completely honest.

40:42.106 --> 40:44.400
And we both know why.

40:44.483 --> 40:46.193
Because some truths
aren't worth telling.

40:46.277 --> 40:47.528
I don't believe that.

40:47.611 --> 40:49.029
Yeah, well, you weren't
molested by your father

40:49.113 --> 40:50.865
and you don't blame yourself
for his death.

40:50.948 --> 40:52.867
His suicide.
His murder.

40:56.787 --> 40:58.372
I killed my father, David.

40:58.455 --> 41:01.000
Did you hear me?

41:01.083 --> 41:03.836
I killed my father.
