00:54.280 --> 00:56.660
No, your name. Please tell me your name.

00:56.760 --> 00:59.340
My name is Charles Ruchowski.

00:59.440 --> 01:00.641
No!

01:05.200 --> 01:08.060
Say the name, Mr.... Mr. Lake!

01:08.160 --> 01:11.260
Tell me, Mr. Lake.
Tell me, what is his name?

01:11.360 --> 01:13.580
Huh? What is the name of the spy?

01:13.680 --> 01:15.420
What is the name of the double?

01:15.520 --> 01:18.180
My name is Charles Ruchowski...

01:18.280 --> 01:20.060
- Okay.
- ...a representative

01:20.160 --> 01:22.620
- for Spirit Systems.
- Uh-huh.

01:22.720 --> 01:25.844
- One more time.
- A representative...

01:27.720 --> 01:29.540
Well, you tell me...

01:29.640 --> 01:32.860
just tell me, Mr. Lake...

01:32.960 --> 01:35.540
- Charles Ruchowski.
- ...what I

01:35.640 --> 01:38.207
need to know!

01:42.520 --> 01:45.540
This... this doesn't end.

01:45.640 --> 01:46.980
No, no, no.

01:47.080 --> 01:51.206
It ends when you die!

01:57.760 --> 02:00.700
Every year at this time,
it is my pleasure...

02:00.800 --> 02:03.780
an honor, really... to introduce

02:03.880 --> 02:06.940
former deputy station chief, Beirut,

02:07.040 --> 02:11.580
Chief of Station Kabul,
holder of the Donovan Award,

02:11.680 --> 02:16.900
the Distinguished intelligence Medal
and the only living recipient

02:17.000 --> 02:21.361
of the intelligence Star, Evan Lake.
Evan.

02:32.200 --> 02:34.243
What the hell are you doing here?

02:35.040 --> 02:36.860
Haven't you heard?

02:36.960 --> 02:40.220
The CIA fell from the Berlin Wall

02:40.320 --> 02:44.660
and all the president's men can't
put it back together again! It's broke!

02:44.760 --> 02:47.620
Not reliable. Not trustworthy.

02:47.720 --> 02:49.700
Can't stand up to the White House.

02:49.800 --> 02:51.620
Backstabbers.

02:51.720 --> 02:54.020
Watching porn, tapping phones.

02:54.120 --> 02:57.005
Best and brightest quit or retired.

02:58.160 --> 03:01.660
What in the name of Jesus Christ
nailed to the cross

03:01.760 --> 03:03.928
are you doing here?

03:06.880 --> 03:08.980
Because you heard the call.

03:09.080 --> 03:10.980
That's why.

03:11.080 --> 03:16.202
Your future spread out before
you like a cruise-ship buffet.

03:17.840 --> 03:21.740
You were teaching in a classroom,
working in a kitchen,

03:21.840 --> 03:24.441
training in a gym
and you heard the call.

03:25.480 --> 03:27.740
For some it was adventure.

03:27.840 --> 03:30.380
For some, mystique.

03:30.480 --> 03:34.420
For all, it was 9/11
and you heard the call,

03:34.520 --> 03:38.460
and it was the call of
duty and love of country.

03:38.560 --> 03:40.420
Why?

03:40.520 --> 03:43.644
Because you have values!

03:52.800 --> 03:54.820
Thanks again, Ev. We appreciate it.

03:54.920 --> 03:56.780
Think they believed a word of it?

03:56.880 --> 03:59.580
- I did.
- You were always an easy touch.

03:59.680 --> 04:02.500
I won't be here next year.
On my way out.

04:02.600 --> 04:05.340
What? You're a pup. What are you, 40?

04:05.440 --> 04:08.500
- Got an offer from the private sector.
- You'll miss it.

04:08.600 --> 04:11.963
Maybe I'll come back next year
just to hear your speech.

04:38.640 --> 04:40.740
Die!

04:40.840 --> 04:42.780
It ends...

04:42.880 --> 04:46.209
when you die!

04:47.840 --> 04:51.500
If you were a reasonable man,
you and I could talk about America.

04:51.600 --> 04:53.540
You would drink something,

04:53.640 --> 04:55.540
you would... you would...
you would be set free.

04:55.640 --> 04:57.020
But no, no, no.

04:57.120 --> 04:58.860
You want to...

04:58.960 --> 05:00.500
you want to die.

05:00.600 --> 05:04.140
He wants to die, huh,
like, what? Crusader!

05:04.240 --> 05:07.220
Huh? No. No, Mr. Lake.

05:07.320 --> 05:10.220
No, it's better that you don't die.

05:10.320 --> 05:11.740
- Charles Ruchowski.
- No, you don't die.

05:11.840 --> 05:13.420
No, no, no, no, no.

05:13.520 --> 05:15.449
Today, you suffer.

05:48.880 --> 05:50.820
I was talking to someone
down at The Farm.

05:50.920 --> 05:53.646
They said you gave a real
barn burner this morning.

05:54.840 --> 05:56.420
What's on your mind?

05:56.520 --> 06:00.260
When I started riding a desk,
it was supposed to be temporary.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.060
That was six years ago.

06:02.160 --> 06:04.362
You've made your country very proud.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.940
I've gone through
all the proper channels,

06:09.040 --> 06:11.860
I've submitted the paperwork,
but I can't seem to reach anyone.

06:11.960 --> 06:14.220
And I am sorry to bother you with this.

06:14.320 --> 06:16.740
How long have you been
in government service?

06:16.840 --> 06:19.540
Marines six years. Agency 30.

06:19.640 --> 06:24.140
S.I.S. three. 36 years,
last three years at medium pay.

06:24.240 --> 06:25.820
That's...

06:25.920 --> 06:27.820
that's 110,000 a year.

06:27.920 --> 06:30.122
Hell, I'd retire for that much.

06:35.720 --> 06:37.445
I doubt that, sir.

06:41.600 --> 06:45.361
I have skills better deployed
in the field.

06:46.360 --> 06:50.060
Ev, you have been an inspiration to me.

06:50.160 --> 06:52.220
I'm not afraid to admit it.

06:52.320 --> 06:53.780
I'll look into it,

06:53.880 --> 06:56.321
see what I can do.

07:09.240 --> 07:10.521
Come in.

07:11.680 --> 07:14.460
- Milt.
- Wanna grab lunch?

07:14.560 --> 07:16.205
Not today.

07:17.040 --> 07:19.500
- How'd it go?
- Not so good.

07:19.600 --> 07:22.724
Director said he's going
to see what he can do.

07:24.480 --> 07:27.260
- You all right?
- Gotta tamper down,

07:27.360 --> 07:29.100
get it under control.

07:29.200 --> 07:31.420
Hey, put that dictionary on my hand.

07:31.520 --> 07:34.940
It's that book over there,
the orange one. It's a dictionary.

07:35.040 --> 07:37.561
I know what a dictionary is. Thank you.

07:40.080 --> 07:42.740
There are two kinds
of people in this world:

07:42.840 --> 07:46.044
men of action and everyone else.

07:49.920 --> 07:51.326
I'll see you.

08:02.680 --> 08:07.727
Headquarters says he's a courier,
but he's not carrying drugs.

08:08.600 --> 08:12.771
They think he's carrying a USB drive.

08:13.800 --> 08:18.608
Where do you think he'll be
hiding the drive, in his shoe?

08:20.360 --> 08:24.167
Probably in his ass.
I'll let you search him first.

08:31.160 --> 08:33.340
There he is.

08:33.440 --> 08:36.179
Abdi Abdikarim.

08:36.280 --> 08:39.299
He doesn't look Nigerian.

08:39.400 --> 08:42.524
He's not Nigerian. Kenyan.

08:51.320 --> 08:54.285
Shit. He's seen us.

09:24.640 --> 09:26.968
We're losing him! Hit the sirens!

09:32.920 --> 09:34.860
Base! Base! We need backup!

09:34.960 --> 09:37.811
We're in pursuit, heading toward
the bridge via Basarab.

10:54.960 --> 10:56.820
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

10:56.920 --> 10:58.485
Stay!

11:09.800 --> 11:12.401
Call the divers.

11:30.800 --> 11:32.968
Give me access to the database.

11:40.480 --> 11:41.460
Yes?

11:41.560 --> 11:43.460
- Milton?
- Yes.

11:43.560 --> 11:45.980
This is Bob Deacon at NSA.

11:46.080 --> 11:49.660
A while back you put in a watch
for certain chemical compounds.

11:49.760 --> 11:52.020
This was three years ago.

11:52.120 --> 11:54.060
You still interested in that?

11:54.160 --> 11:56.140
- I am.
- Good, something's come up.

11:56.240 --> 11:58.620
Where can I find you? I'm coming over.

11:58.720 --> 12:01.180
A couple of weeks ago
that flash drive came

12:01.280 --> 12:02.860
into the possession of the Romanians.

12:02.960 --> 12:05.460
It was water-damaged...
the guy jumped off a bridge.

12:05.560 --> 12:08.660
SRI had no luck, so they asked us
to take a crack at it.

12:08.760 --> 12:11.300
On it we found porn,

12:11.400 --> 12:12.660
Islamic sermons,

12:12.760 --> 12:15.020
Angry Birds and medical reports.

12:15.120 --> 12:16.260
That's where you come in.

12:16.360 --> 12:19.580
We ran "decitabine"
and your request came up.

12:19.680 --> 12:22.180
Who was Abdi Abdikarim?

12:22.280 --> 12:23.780
Kenyan national.

12:23.880 --> 12:25.260
We had some old passport records.

12:25.360 --> 12:26.620
Other than that, nothing.

12:26.720 --> 12:28.700
SRI made inquiries...

12:28.800 --> 12:30.940
but the Kenyans weren't
all that much help.

12:31.040 --> 12:32.780
Can I have a copy of the full document?

12:32.880 --> 12:34.820
- There's over 50 pages.
- That's all right.

12:34.920 --> 12:36.531
I'll take it electronically.

12:44.640 --> 12:46.180
You know that the only thing

12:46.280 --> 12:48.860
standing between me
and reassignment is your approval.

12:48.960 --> 12:50.980
Mr. Lake, what do you wish
to do when you return?

12:51.080 --> 12:53.100
There is unfinished business.

12:53.200 --> 12:54.700
Well, that's what I wish
you would talk about.

12:54.800 --> 12:56.820
Muhammad Banir is alive.

12:56.920 --> 12:58.820
They say he's dead... everybody says...

12:58.920 --> 13:01.940
- killed in the explosion.
- There was a body.

13:02.040 --> 13:04.220
So what? I didn't see any head.

13:04.320 --> 13:07.000
I didn't see Banir's head.

13:08.040 --> 13:10.460
If you wish to return
to work at the CIA...

13:10.560 --> 13:12.620
- if I wish to return?
- ...I would strongly suggest

13:12.720 --> 13:15.287
that you put the matter of
Muhammad Banir behind you.

13:21.880 --> 13:24.048
Fuck!

13:25.200 --> 13:27.300
All the indications
pointed that direction,

13:27.400 --> 13:30.780
but it wasn't until the PET scan was
complete that we could be sure.

13:30.880 --> 13:33.500
- No more memory tests?
- Just the opposite.

13:33.600 --> 13:35.420
Mental exercises are
shown to be effective...

13:35.520 --> 13:38.246
All right, what is it?
Eight years and I'm dead?

13:39.240 --> 13:42.220
Mr. Ruchowski, this is not Alzheimer's.

13:42.320 --> 13:46.980
For many years, frontotemporal dementia
and Alzheimer's were confused,

13:47.080 --> 13:50.100
but frontotemporal dementia
is a separate disease.

13:50.200 --> 13:52.607
It's better?

13:53.720 --> 13:57.100
FTD is much more aggressive.

13:57.200 --> 14:00.340
Much more? How much more?

14:00.440 --> 14:02.540
Did anyone come with you today?

14:02.640 --> 14:03.660
No.

14:03.760 --> 14:06.300
Family is very important
in a situation like this.

14:06.400 --> 14:07.940
I don't have any brothers or sisters.

14:08.040 --> 14:11.323
No children. My work is my family.

14:12.160 --> 14:14.820
This frontal... FTD,

14:14.920 --> 14:17.220
is there anything I should
be on the lookout for?

14:17.320 --> 14:21.540
You will be subject to overreactions
or inappropriate reactions,

14:21.640 --> 14:24.020
blank spells.
Perhaps you've noticed this already.

14:24.120 --> 14:26.900
Mood swings,
unreliable sensory perception.

14:27.000 --> 14:30.300
"Unreliable sensory perception."

14:30.400 --> 14:32.780
That's what it's called.

14:32.880 --> 14:37.220
There are support groups,
social services here in Philadelphia...

14:37.320 --> 14:38.885
in fact, wherever you go.

14:40.160 --> 14:41.940
I've spoken with Dr. Gross,
Nathan Gross,

14:42.040 --> 14:43.500
in the Special Care wing.

14:43.600 --> 14:45.660
Now after we're finished,
you'll pay him a visit.

14:45.760 --> 14:47.500
He's expecting you.

14:47.600 --> 14:50.451
There's no reason to be alone in this.

15:02.920 --> 15:04.540
So what is prescribed?

15:04.640 --> 15:06.620
Usually serotonin inhibitors...

15:06.720 --> 15:09.860
Zoloft, Paxil... or antidepressants.

15:09.960 --> 15:12.540
But those are drugs for crazy people,

15:12.640 --> 15:14.780
manic-depressives. That's not me.

15:14.880 --> 15:17.140
Okay, let's get that clear.
That's not who I am.

15:17.240 --> 15:21.020
Look, these medications address
the behavioral symptoms.

15:21.120 --> 15:23.891
- Not the disease?
- That's correct.

16:01.240 --> 16:04.100
Hey. Have you seen Lake?

16:04.200 --> 16:06.060
He hasn't been here all day.

16:06.160 --> 16:08.100
Do you know where he is? Did he call in?

16:08.200 --> 16:10.289
I'm busy, sir. Sorry.

16:33.080 --> 16:35.580
- Yeah?
- Evan, where are you?

16:35.680 --> 16:37.928
I've been trying to reach you.
I left messages.

16:38.720 --> 16:40.260
I've been busy.

16:40.360 --> 16:42.620
- Something's come up.
- What?

16:42.720 --> 16:44.780
I don't wanna talk about it
over an open line.

16:44.880 --> 16:46.923
Where are you? I'll come meet you.

16:48.640 --> 16:50.300
Evan, where are you?

16:50.400 --> 16:51.740
Diamond Tuesdays.

16:51.840 --> 16:53.980
You're at Ruby Tuesdays?

16:54.080 --> 16:56.860
Yes, I'm at Ruby Tuesdays.
That's what I just said.

16:56.960 --> 16:59.420
Okay, which one?

16:59.520 --> 17:01.245
The one in...

17:03.400 --> 17:05.045
Arlington.

17:20.280 --> 17:22.164
- Ev.
- Yeah?

17:24.640 --> 17:25.780
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

17:25.880 --> 17:28.140
Get this man something to eat, please,

17:28.240 --> 17:30.761
- and a cup of coffee.
- You got it.

17:36.280 --> 17:37.860
Can I clear that for you?

17:37.960 --> 17:39.685
Hey.

17:40.880 --> 17:43.003
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

17:49.520 --> 17:51.165
That wasn't very sociable.

17:52.200 --> 17:53.860
What's going on?

17:53.960 --> 17:55.900
Nothing.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.460
Do you want to talk about it?

17:57.560 --> 17:59.620
What is so goddamn important?

17:59.720 --> 18:02.890
This "something" that has come up.

18:04.360 --> 18:07.370
There's been a possible hit on Banir.

18:08.480 --> 18:11.620
Over the last year,
five requests for deferiprone

18:11.720 --> 18:14.620
- which is not too unusual...
- No, it doesn't affect the anemia.

18:14.720 --> 18:16.140
It's just the iron deficiency.

18:16.240 --> 18:17.940
Right, but the same source...

18:18.040 --> 18:20.060
the man requesting it was Kenyan,

18:20.160 --> 18:23.220
but the doctor is in Bucharest
University Hospital,

18:23.320 --> 18:25.300
a research hospital.

18:25.400 --> 18:28.060
Decitabine and azacitidine,

18:28.160 --> 18:30.100
which are only used
for clinical trials...

18:30.200 --> 18:31.660
Mediterranean anemia.

18:31.760 --> 18:33.860
Thalassemia, which is hereditary,

18:33.960 --> 18:36.300
which we know Muhammad Banir carries,

18:36.400 --> 18:38.660
even though he has
been dead for 20 years.

18:38.760 --> 18:40.540
You know his father died of it.

18:40.640 --> 18:42.740
And Abdikarim,
the man procuring the drug,

18:42.840 --> 18:46.220
was a suspect in a Nigerian fraud ring.

18:46.320 --> 18:49.700
Rather than give himself up,
he jumps off a bridge.

18:49.800 --> 18:54.220
Medical info was on a flash drive.

18:54.320 --> 18:57.060
- He ain't no Kenyan.
- He was 100% healthy.

18:57.160 --> 18:59.780
- He had no need for the medication.
- What else?

18:59.880 --> 19:03.140
- Nothing.
- I knew he didn't die.

19:03.240 --> 19:06.500
This means his condition has
moved to an advanced stage.

19:06.600 --> 19:09.060
Now he can lay low,
he can become invisible,

19:09.160 --> 19:12.170
but sooner or later
the disease will flush him out.

19:13.640 --> 19:15.251
Banir's got it.

19:16.160 --> 19:18.044
It's come out.

19:18.880 --> 19:20.605
It's in his blood.

19:36.440 --> 19:38.608
Peace be with you, Shaykh Banir.

19:44.040 --> 19:46.700
Where is Dr. Wangari?

19:46.800 --> 19:50.891
He wasn't there, Shaykh.
They told me he went to Mtwapa.

19:51.680 --> 19:54.451
He will be back tomorrow, God willing.

19:55.960 --> 19:57.740
Any word from Bucharest?

19:57.840 --> 19:59.610
No, Shaykh.

20:04.720 --> 20:07.082
When the doctor returns,

20:07.880 --> 20:08.900
bring him with you.

20:09.000 --> 20:09.980
Hmm?

20:10.080 --> 20:11.281
Yes, Shaykh.

20:13.280 --> 20:15.244
It's time for prayers.

20:16.840 --> 20:18.690
Mbui!

20:32.640 --> 20:35.020
Sorry to impose on our relationship.

20:35.120 --> 20:37.780
- What is it?
- I've come across intelligence

20:37.880 --> 20:40.401
which leads me to believe
Muhammad Banir is alive.

20:42.560 --> 20:44.444
Give us the room, gentlemen.

20:53.480 --> 20:54.700
Go on.

20:54.800 --> 20:57.620
Banir was believed killed
during my extraction.

20:57.720 --> 20:59.260
The evidence was circumstantial.

20:59.360 --> 21:02.380
Intelligence intercepts led the
agency to conclude Banir was dead.

21:02.480 --> 21:03.940
He disappeared from our radar.

21:04.040 --> 21:05.540
The CIA closed the books on him.

21:05.640 --> 21:08.380
Not a word about him has been
heard for 22 years... until now.

21:08.480 --> 21:11.140
Banir has a hereditary blood disease...

21:11.240 --> 21:13.900
thalassemia.
If not apparent during childhood,

21:14.000 --> 21:15.980
it can lay dormant
until midlife or later.

21:16.080 --> 21:18.340
There have been recent
intercepts of requests

21:18.440 --> 21:22.300
for medicine used primarily
during clinical trials for this anemia.

21:22.400 --> 21:26.047
These requests have a Kenyan source.

21:27.680 --> 21:30.380
And what's the source
of these intercepts?

21:30.480 --> 21:32.260
The source is confidential.

21:32.360 --> 21:35.860
Lake, I am the director
of the fucking agency.

21:35.960 --> 21:39.562
Nothing is confidential.
Who's the source?

21:41.240 --> 21:42.900
If the source were to become known,

21:43.000 --> 21:45.700
- the source would be in danger.
- What do you propose?

21:45.800 --> 21:47.500
I would like to set up a task force,

21:47.600 --> 21:49.740
establish Banir's whereabouts,
extract him,

21:49.840 --> 21:52.060
and have him return to
the United States for trial.

21:52.160 --> 21:53.980
You'd like to set up a task force?

21:54.080 --> 21:57.740
- I meant the agency, sir.
- Why don't we just let the man die?

21:57.840 --> 22:01.060
That is assuming that your
confidential source is correct,

22:01.160 --> 22:02.980
and assuming that
it does in fact indicate

22:03.080 --> 22:05.620
the presence of a man that no
one's heard of in 22 years.

22:05.720 --> 22:07.900
Because it is not the
policy of this agency,

22:08.000 --> 22:11.620
nor is it the policy of this government,
to allow the man who's responsible

22:11.720 --> 22:14.900
for at least 17 kidnappings,
a dozen executions

22:15.000 --> 22:16.660
and the bombing of a tourist bus...

22:16.760 --> 22:18.940
some of whom
were children, by the way...

22:19.040 --> 22:22.084
to go free simply because he's sick.

22:28.560 --> 22:31.604
Mary, sent in Sanjar.

22:34.720 --> 22:35.921
Come in.

22:38.080 --> 22:39.420
This is Dr. Sanjar.

22:39.520 --> 22:41.700
He's with the Office
of Medical Services.

22:41.800 --> 22:43.980
Please, Evan, sit.

22:44.080 --> 22:47.740
Dr. Sanjar was speaking
at UPenn Hospital...

22:47.840 --> 22:50.620
a conference on
service-related diseases.

22:50.720 --> 22:54.340
Did you really think
you could travel 150 miles,

22:54.440 --> 22:58.500
make three visits to a neurological
clinic under a false identity,

22:58.600 --> 23:02.449
give blood, leave fingerprints
and not have us find out about it?

23:03.440 --> 23:06.380
Dr. Clayborne forwarded
your medical records.

23:06.480 --> 23:10.900
You don't have to worry about
payment or privacy or quality of care.

23:11.000 --> 23:12.820
The CIA takes care of its own.

23:12.920 --> 23:15.340
The OMS has a state-of-the-art facility.

23:15.440 --> 23:17.260
In addition to which,
we coordinate our efforts

23:17.360 --> 23:19.180
with AFRH here in Washington.

23:19.280 --> 23:22.060
And we'd like to make this
as easy as possible for you.

23:22.160 --> 23:23.700
We've been speaking to the DDO.

23:23.800 --> 23:25.780
We'll have a retirement dinner.

23:25.880 --> 23:27.460
The press... everyone'll come.

23:27.560 --> 23:29.180
Heck, even the president will be there.

23:29.280 --> 23:32.780
Banir. What about Banir?

23:32.880 --> 23:35.180
Muhammad Banir is dead, Lake.

23:35.280 --> 23:37.300
Has been for 22 years.

23:37.400 --> 23:40.140
We interviewed
your departmental associates.

23:40.240 --> 23:42.860
We are concerned about these
mood swings you've been suffering,

23:42.960 --> 23:44.740
the unpredictability of behavior.

23:44.840 --> 23:47.407
Banir, damn it.

23:48.440 --> 23:52.260
There is a concern that you could
become a liability to the agency.

23:52.360 --> 23:54.460
- Fuck you.
- Calm down.

23:54.560 --> 23:57.220
I'm a liability? You fucked this up

23:57.320 --> 23:59.500
just like you fucked up everything else.

23:59.600 --> 24:02.380
Fucked up Iran-Contra, fucked up Ames,

24:02.480 --> 24:04.300
fucked up 9/11, fucked up WMD,

24:04.400 --> 24:06.300
Afghanistan, Iraq, Benghazi.

24:06.400 --> 24:08.300
Not you yourself of course, no.

24:08.400 --> 24:10.980
No, you're just the latest
in a long line of fuck-ups

24:11.080 --> 24:14.380
who turned this agency into a cesspool
of politics and special interests

24:14.480 --> 24:17.020
on behalf of the weapons makers
and the surveillance industry,

24:17.120 --> 24:18.780
who get richer while we get weaker!

24:18.880 --> 24:20.969
- Mr. Lake.
- I could...

24:24.000 --> 24:26.740
I've forgotten more about this agency
than you'll ever know.

24:26.840 --> 24:28.900
Who put you up to this, huh?

24:29.000 --> 24:31.860
Whose got their hand in your pocket now?

24:31.960 --> 24:34.180
I've seen a million people like you.

24:34.280 --> 24:35.820
A million people.

24:35.920 --> 24:38.260
You've got your head
so far up Obama's ass,

24:38.360 --> 24:40.420
you can't see anything
except his shit anymore.

24:40.520 --> 24:42.245
Shame on you.

24:43.080 --> 24:45.248
Shame on you.

24:51.160 --> 24:53.780
- Agent Lake?
- Yes.

24:53.880 --> 24:56.860
The director's asked us to collect
your security badge.

24:56.960 --> 24:58.241
Please stand, sir.

25:02.360 --> 25:05.500
Sir, we've been instructed
to escort you out of the facility.

25:05.600 --> 25:07.500
Place the items you would like to take

25:07.600 --> 25:09.325
here on the desk for inspection, sir.

25:10.880 --> 25:12.460
You want to check my aftershave?

25:12.560 --> 25:14.020
There's no need to be snippy, sir.

25:14.120 --> 25:16.180
You want my life? You want my files?

25:16.280 --> 25:18.460
Here, take them! Would you like awards?

25:18.560 --> 25:20.060
Here. Here's a couple of them for you.

25:20.160 --> 25:22.460
This is what they give
to assholes like me

25:22.560 --> 25:24.540
who give their lives for their country!

25:24.640 --> 25:26.444
Core values!

25:28.280 --> 25:31.140
Get someone else to give
your goddamn lecture!

25:31.240 --> 25:32.851
I resign!

26:07.440 --> 26:10.620
I have your stuff.
I... I hope you don't mind.

26:10.720 --> 26:12.410
I didn't want to leave it there.

26:13.280 --> 26:14.891
Can I come in?

26:16.360 --> 26:18.005
Yeah, come in.

26:18.960 --> 26:20.844
Thanks.

26:30.120 --> 26:32.140
You... you want something to drink?

26:32.240 --> 26:34.260
What are you having?

26:34.360 --> 26:36.767
- Sake.
- Sounds good.

26:48.640 --> 26:51.820
I screwed up pretty bad today, huh?

26:51.920 --> 26:54.060
No going back.

26:54.160 --> 26:56.860
So much for the retirement party.

26:56.960 --> 26:59.700
They're not gonna
do nothing about Banir.

26:59.800 --> 27:03.209
They treated me like I was
some sort of crackpot.

27:06.320 --> 27:08.420
- Kanpai.
- Kanpai.

27:08.520 --> 27:10.643
Have a seat.

27:16.080 --> 27:18.060
That's the other reason I came.

27:18.160 --> 27:22.540
NSA forwarded a copy
of Abdi's flash drive.

27:22.640 --> 27:24.260
The prescribing physician

27:24.360 --> 27:27.740
is Dr. Iulian Cornel, medical research.

27:27.840 --> 27:29.500
That's why none of the
indicators went off.

27:29.600 --> 27:32.963
- How long has this been happening?
- Two years.

27:34.640 --> 27:36.900
- Banir...
- Well...

27:37.000 --> 27:41.580
...possible Banir uses
Abdikarim as a middleman.

27:41.680 --> 27:45.140
Their communications,
any information about possible Banir...

27:45.240 --> 27:47.568
Goes into the river...

27:48.360 --> 27:50.140
or so he thinks.

27:50.240 --> 27:54.923
And Abdi pays Dr. Cornel.

27:59.720 --> 28:01.331
Evan.

28:05.000 --> 28:09.842
Ignorant... ignorant doctor in this?

28:10.720 --> 28:12.620
Well, except for one thing.

28:12.720 --> 28:15.100
Dr. Cornel has a Kenyan wife.

28:15.200 --> 28:17.140
Ah.

28:17.240 --> 28:18.820
How much does he charge?

28:18.920 --> 28:21.460
10k euro every month.

28:21.560 --> 28:22.820
- And doesn't report it.
- Nope.

28:22.920 --> 28:24.820
Now we're on the same page.

28:24.920 --> 28:27.964
The doctor's protecting himself.
You got the files?

28:29.160 --> 28:30.780
- You know what?
- What?

28:30.880 --> 28:32.980
This is cool.

28:33.080 --> 28:35.300
Print 'em out.
I don't like to read off a monitor.

28:35.400 --> 28:36.726
All right.

28:44.920 --> 28:46.780
No answer?

28:46.880 --> 28:48.684
No, Shaykh.

28:51.760 --> 28:53.220
Aasim.

28:53.320 --> 28:54.500
Yes, Shaykh.

28:54.600 --> 28:56.484
Come here.

28:57.280 --> 28:58.780
There has been no answer?

28:58.880 --> 29:00.140
Was the money withdrawn?

29:00.240 --> 29:01.885
Two weeks ago.

29:03.400 --> 29:04.860
Maybe something happened to him.

29:04.960 --> 29:08.289
Aasim. Aasim. Aasim.

29:14.240 --> 29:16.140
- You have a visa?
- Mm-hmm.

29:16.240 --> 29:18.820
- Speak English?
- Yeah.

29:18.920 --> 29:22.060
I need you to go... go to Bucharest.

29:22.160 --> 29:25.220
I need you to find this... doctor.

29:25.320 --> 29:27.540
I need you to get the medication, hmm?

29:27.640 --> 29:29.524
Mmm.

29:31.120 --> 29:34.847
Shave your beard and get...

29:35.800 --> 29:37.684
European ways.

29:46.840 --> 29:48.883
Better idea.

29:51.680 --> 29:55.043
Get this Cornel to come here.

29:57.320 --> 29:59.420
What if... if he give me problems?

29:59.520 --> 30:01.460
If he does not want to come?

30:01.560 --> 30:05.180
Tell him the family of his wife

30:05.280 --> 30:06.540
will not be spared.

30:06.640 --> 30:09.241
Yeah, that's good. That's good.

30:13.840 --> 30:16.088
Here he is.

30:17.680 --> 30:20.300
"Dr. Iulian Cornel,

30:20.400 --> 30:24.660
Grant to develop novel
therapeutic agents: b-thalassemia.

30:24.760 --> 30:27.940
Sponsor: Cooley's Anemia Foundation."

30:28.040 --> 30:30.420
Bingo. Muhammad Banir,

30:30.520 --> 30:32.660
you think you can hide?

30:32.760 --> 30:35.850
Nobody can hide from the reaper.

30:37.760 --> 30:39.325
Can we get in?

30:40.520 --> 30:42.300
- Into what?
- Into the correspondence

30:42.400 --> 30:43.740
between Banir and the doctor.

30:43.840 --> 30:46.520
Cornel hasn't heard from Abdi...

30:47.360 --> 30:48.940
so now he's wondering...

30:49.040 --> 30:50.969
"Where's my payment?"

30:51.960 --> 30:55.500
- it... it's possible, but...
- But what?

30:55.600 --> 30:59.380
If this med is for Banir,

30:59.480 --> 31:02.060
why hasn't anyone heard
from him in 20 years?

31:02.160 --> 31:04.220
I can explain.

31:04.320 --> 31:08.300
Banir thought I had an asset
in his group, a double.

31:08.400 --> 31:10.820
That's what he was trying
to get me to give up.

31:10.920 --> 31:12.540
There was no fucking asset.

31:12.640 --> 31:15.801
I couldn't give it up even if I wanted,
but that was the deal.

31:16.600 --> 31:19.420
After my extraction, I had my doubts,

31:19.520 --> 31:23.460
so I sent some intelligence hinting
that Banir himself was the double,

31:23.560 --> 31:26.420
a cable that would be intercepted
at the highest levels.

31:26.520 --> 31:30.340
If he was still alive, I wanted
him off the playing field.

31:30.440 --> 31:32.802
I drove him into the ground.

31:35.200 --> 31:37.289
Everybody figured he was dead.

31:38.080 --> 31:40.260
- I had my doubts.
- Why?

31:40.360 --> 31:42.860
Because he's a true believer.

31:42.960 --> 31:44.660
Guys like that don't just die.

31:44.760 --> 31:48.140
You gotta... you gotta rip out
their hearts with your bare hands.

31:48.240 --> 31:51.460
You've been giving this
a lot of thought, haven't you?

31:51.560 --> 31:54.020
- Just once a day.
- Every day.

31:54.120 --> 31:55.924
All day long.

32:01.880 --> 32:03.491
Don't answer it.

32:12.480 --> 32:15.570
Shit. Uh, just stay there.

32:18.760 --> 32:20.580
Dr. Sanjar, I'm real busy right now.

32:20.680 --> 32:22.500
- I don't have the time.
- Evan, I don't want

32:22.600 --> 32:25.180
to leave it the way it was left today.
It was not right.

32:25.280 --> 32:27.180
- It's all right.
- No, it's not.

32:27.280 --> 32:29.980
I'm not going to let you
push this aside.

32:30.080 --> 32:32.620
We want to help you. Come to my office,

32:32.720 --> 32:35.780
we'll sit down, have a talk,
prepare for the future.

32:35.880 --> 32:38.460
It doesn't have to be tomorrow.
Whenever you like.

32:38.560 --> 32:42.820
- Agreed?
- Yeah. Agreed.

32:42.920 --> 32:46.203
- I'll see you then.
- I'll see you then.

32:48.080 --> 32:50.580
You gonna tell me what that was about?

32:50.680 --> 32:52.380
It's nothing. Let's get drunk.

32:52.480 --> 32:55.780
This goes back to when
I found you at Ruby Tuesdays,

32:55.880 --> 32:58.740
- doesn't it?
- Can't a man have any privacy?

32:58.840 --> 33:01.820
All right, look,
I'm risking my job here,

33:01.920 --> 33:03.780
but you've got another program running,

33:03.880 --> 33:06.180
something you won't tell me about.

33:06.280 --> 33:09.689
You gotta be straight.
You owe me that much.

33:26.720 --> 33:28.445
Happy?

33:31.480 --> 33:32.900
It's not so bad now...

33:33.000 --> 33:35.140
little things, things that I can hide...

33:35.240 --> 33:39.340
but that's a train that
only runs one way.

33:39.440 --> 33:41.620
Everything up here?

33:41.720 --> 33:44.140
Rotting. Bit by bit,

33:44.240 --> 33:45.980
it slips away.

33:46.080 --> 33:48.940
- You've known this...
- I suspected.

33:49.040 --> 33:51.820
About a year ago,
something in my head just...

33:51.920 --> 33:53.380
fell.

33:53.480 --> 33:57.180
By the time you start showing symptoms,
the atrophy's done its damage,

33:57.280 --> 33:58.660
brain mass has decreased.

33:58.760 --> 34:00.820
Three years, my guess. That's about it.

34:00.920 --> 34:03.900
You know, I wanna know something.
Were they asking about me?

34:04.000 --> 34:08.300
Uh, not to me directly, but yeah.

34:08.400 --> 34:10.659
- You're angry?
- Not at them.

34:10.760 --> 34:13.380
Well, actually, maybe at them,
but this whole damn thing.

34:13.480 --> 34:15.659
Why me? Why the fuck me?

34:15.760 --> 34:19.726
- I didn't do anything wrong!
- Ev, you still have time left.

34:20.600 --> 34:22.620
Make the most of it.

34:22.719 --> 34:27.100
Why waste it looking for someone
who may not even exist?

34:27.199 --> 34:29.846
He does exist.

34:33.800 --> 34:35.900
There is a window here.

34:36.000 --> 34:39.500
It won't be open long,
and then it will close

34:39.600 --> 34:41.580
and Banir will have gotten away with it.

34:41.679 --> 34:45.739
And I am gonna do something
worth remembering

34:45.840 --> 34:48.202
with what's left of my time.

35:25.600 --> 35:27.450
Could you please step out?

35:31.040 --> 35:32.940
Mr. Lake, we're going
back to the station.

35:33.040 --> 35:35.620
Please get in the patrol car.
I will drive you there.

35:35.720 --> 35:37.922
Place your keys under the seat.

35:39.920 --> 35:41.100
What have I done?

35:41.200 --> 35:44.260
State law requires physicians to report

35:44.360 --> 35:47.340
all conditions that might cause
a loss of consciousness, Mr. Lake.

35:47.440 --> 35:49.100
Your name is on this list.

35:49.200 --> 35:51.740
Now if this is an error,
it will be corrected at the station.

35:51.840 --> 35:54.540
Look, I work for
the United States government,

35:54.640 --> 35:57.300
- just like you.
- Another officer will bring your car.

35:57.400 --> 35:59.140
If there's someone you'd like
to pick you up,

35:59.240 --> 36:00.500
you can call them from the station.

36:00.600 --> 36:03.087
If you have a cellphone,
you can call now.

36:05.840 --> 36:09.283
What made him jump, the Kenyan?

36:10.240 --> 36:12.380
All right, he's a conduit
for pharmaceuticals.

36:12.480 --> 36:15.380
He's been protecting the location
of someone presumed dead.

36:15.480 --> 36:19.002
He's been accused of this
Nigerian drug fraud scam.

36:20.040 --> 36:21.460
What makes him jump?

36:21.560 --> 36:24.460
It had to be something else.

36:24.560 --> 36:26.780
Something he knew.
Something he was afraid he'd give up.

36:26.880 --> 36:28.940
Yeah, something scary.

36:29.040 --> 36:31.607
The money came in.

36:32.440 --> 36:35.660
10,000 euros, Abdi's account.

36:35.760 --> 36:37.980
And no one to pick it up.
Shit, I gotta hurry.

36:38.080 --> 36:39.770
The clock's running.

36:40.760 --> 36:42.980
You're going to Romania?

36:43.080 --> 36:45.820
How? Have you thought about
how you're gonna do it?

36:45.920 --> 36:47.700
Go to Bucharest, collect the money,

36:47.800 --> 36:49.700
track down the bad guy, charter a jet,

36:49.800 --> 36:51.740
set her down at Andrew's Air Force Base.

36:51.840 --> 36:54.042
No, not in detail.

36:55.680 --> 36:58.220
- I'm coming with you.
- No, you're not.

36:58.320 --> 37:01.380
- Let me come with you.
- I'm not helpless.

37:01.480 --> 37:03.380
I know, but do you have multiple ID?

37:03.480 --> 37:05.500
- I have old passport...
- Old passport won't cut

37:05.600 --> 37:07.340
a deal like this,
not in today's security.

37:07.440 --> 37:10.620
We'll need at least
three sets, all vetted.

37:10.720 --> 37:13.460
- How long for the IDs?
- Two days, three.

37:13.560 --> 37:14.980
- What if I say no?
- No what?

37:15.080 --> 37:16.620
No, you can't come.

37:16.720 --> 37:19.500
Well then, Mr. Secret Agent Man,

37:19.600 --> 37:22.644
I might have to drop a dime on you.

37:23.880 --> 37:25.809
You know, I half believe you would.

37:39.800 --> 37:41.580
It's programmed to the
number I was given.

37:41.680 --> 37:44.360
Only call if it's an emergency.

37:45.200 --> 37:46.380
You have cash?

37:46.480 --> 37:48.091
Yes.

37:49.440 --> 37:51.165
So this will be your car.

37:53.800 --> 37:55.860
- Do you have...
- Don't tell me anything.

37:55.960 --> 37:57.730
I know nothing.

38:00.400 --> 38:02.125
Do you have a gun?

38:02.920 --> 38:04.360
In the trunk.

38:12.600 --> 38:15.380
Have you clarified your plan?

38:15.480 --> 38:18.460
There's a woman meeting us in Bucharest.

38:18.560 --> 38:21.860
Oh. You are full of surprises.

38:21.960 --> 38:26.971
Michelle Zubarain, used to be a
journalist, Mid-East danger junkie.

38:27.800 --> 38:30.060
Might even have been an agent.

38:30.160 --> 38:32.340
She works out of Prague now.

38:32.440 --> 38:36.326
- She an old flame?
- Just someone I used to know.

38:37.680 --> 38:41.660
- And?
- Just, you know, one step at a time.

38:41.760 --> 38:44.611
Seeing what'll happen next.

38:57.720 --> 38:59.922
Professor Dr. Iulian Cornel.

39:01.480 --> 39:03.967
Nothing particularly
stands out about him.

39:05.040 --> 39:09.563
Keeps a low profile, community service,
sits on a couple of boards.

39:10.600 --> 39:12.380
What about his wife?

39:12.480 --> 39:15.220
Angena? They met through an aid program.

39:15.320 --> 39:17.761
- Where?
- Mombasa.

39:19.840 --> 39:21.700
- Sir.
- What?

39:21.800 --> 39:23.260
This is a nonsmoking section.

39:23.360 --> 39:25.881
Let me just check something.

39:27.840 --> 39:29.540
Yup, I am in Romania.

39:29.640 --> 39:31.340
Are you out of your fucking mind?

39:31.440 --> 39:33.660
This whole country is a smoking section.

39:33.760 --> 39:36.820
- Evan.
- Okay. Okay.

39:36.920 --> 39:38.700
Sir, there is a smoking area upstairs.

39:38.800 --> 39:40.340
I'm putting it out!

39:40.440 --> 39:42.768
Jesus!

39:44.200 --> 39:46.641
Thank you for bringing that
to our attention.

39:47.800 --> 39:49.860
I know. I'm sorry, Michelle.

39:49.960 --> 39:51.500
I'm sorry about that. It's the jetlag.

39:51.600 --> 39:54.451
It's got me...
it's got me turned around.

39:56.080 --> 39:57.460
It's all right.

39:57.560 --> 40:00.060
What's the best way
to approach Dr. Cornel?

40:00.160 --> 40:02.300
In his office during business hours,

40:02.400 --> 40:04.460
closed door, with colleagues nearby.

40:04.560 --> 40:06.420
I've prepared an official cover.

40:06.520 --> 40:08.660
You'll be my American colleagues.

40:08.760 --> 40:10.450
Okay.

40:17.760 --> 40:20.380
How did you and Michelle meet?

40:20.480 --> 40:22.940
If I'm not being too forward.

40:23.040 --> 40:25.100
No, it's not too forward. It just...

40:25.200 --> 40:28.006
wasn't particularly glamorous.

40:29.960 --> 40:33.243
How did you and Evan meet?
That's more interesting.

40:36.960 --> 40:38.980
I was a...

40:39.080 --> 40:42.500
non-official covert op in Cairo.

40:42.600 --> 40:45.580
And I lost an asset...

40:45.680 --> 40:47.660
the son of a cabinet minister.

40:47.760 --> 40:50.740
My fuck-up. Ugly political situation.

40:50.840 --> 40:53.441
The agency just stepped back.

40:54.360 --> 40:55.820
Then Evan Lake showed up.

40:55.920 --> 40:58.500
Two days later, I was on a
plane back to Washington.

40:58.600 --> 41:02.725
They just needed to be reminded
we take care of our own.

41:05.600 --> 41:07.100
I was a believer then.

41:07.200 --> 41:10.020
You still have it, don't you?

41:10.120 --> 41:13.005
- What?
- You know what I'm talking about.

41:15.720 --> 41:17.684
Show him, Evan.

41:22.040 --> 41:24.971
Yeah, I caught a bullet
when I was extracted.

41:26.360 --> 41:29.340
He offered once to have
that bullet put in a ring...

41:29.440 --> 41:31.802
if I'd agree to wear it on my finger.

41:32.840 --> 41:35.247
I bet you didn't know
he was such a romantic.

41:39.720 --> 41:42.140
I've gotta get back to the room.

41:42.240 --> 41:44.807
This flight really took it out of me.

41:51.320 --> 41:53.124
I'll see you later.

41:56.120 --> 41:58.084
Did you have to say that?

41:59.320 --> 42:02.763
- Did I embarrass you?
- You couldn't embarrass me.

42:49.440 --> 42:51.369
Everybody set?

43:11.840 --> 43:14.168
That's him in the glasses.

43:20.480 --> 43:22.380
- Dr. Cornel?
- Da.

43:22.480 --> 43:25.500
Natalie Negrescu, Politia Romania.
Is there somewhere we can talk?

43:25.600 --> 43:27.140
What's wrong?

43:27.240 --> 43:31.580
These are my colleagues, Mr. Auon from
the American Embassy and Mr. Richards

43:31.680 --> 43:34.260
from the United States
Homeland Security.

43:34.360 --> 43:35.607
Please.

43:37.680 --> 43:40.247
- M-my office, please.
- Da.

43:41.440 --> 43:43.660
Decitabine is not a prohibited drug,

43:43.760 --> 43:46.260
- so I don't see why...
- Dr. Cornel, I'm here as a liaison.

43:46.360 --> 43:48.620
This request has come
through official channels.

43:48.720 --> 43:50.888
It originates from Washington, DC.

43:51.720 --> 43:53.365
Washington?

43:54.200 --> 43:57.580
- English, please.
- We have an interest in this person,

43:57.680 --> 43:59.803
Abdi Abdikarim.

44:00.800 --> 44:02.420
What kind of a name is that anyway?

44:02.520 --> 44:05.100
He said he was Kenyan.

44:05.200 --> 44:09.340
- What's your connection to him?
- I only met him once at a coffee shop.

44:09.440 --> 44:11.940
- The rest was through the mails.
- When was that?

44:12.040 --> 44:14.220
- Two years ago.
- You've been prescribing

44:14.320 --> 44:18.300
a rare, potent drug to somebody you met
once in a coffee shop two years ago?

44:18.400 --> 44:19.940
He had medical records.

44:20.040 --> 44:23.700
He was representing someone else,
but the name had been redacted.

44:23.800 --> 44:26.260
You have no knowledge of
who's actually using this drug?

44:26.360 --> 44:28.460
None whatsoever,
but I did nothing wrong.

44:28.560 --> 44:30.410
I did everything by the book.

44:31.360 --> 44:33.100
20,000 euros every two months.

44:33.200 --> 44:35.402
Does that sound about right?

44:48.920 --> 44:52.761
And why should that be
a security concern?

44:53.640 --> 44:57.447
Cornish...

44:58.680 --> 45:00.245
Cornish.

45:01.560 --> 45:03.100
Cornel.

45:03.200 --> 45:05.780
Dr. Julian Cornel,

45:05.880 --> 45:09.641
let us decide what is
or isn't a security concern.

45:10.440 --> 45:12.085
Arrest him.

45:14.040 --> 45:15.900
Dr. Cornel, could you please stand up.

45:16.000 --> 45:17.260
What?

45:17.360 --> 45:18.721
Turn around.

45:19.520 --> 45:21.820
No, no, no, I can't be arrested.
I cannot be arrested.

45:21.920 --> 45:23.820
- You don't understand.
- Tell it to your lawyer.

45:23.920 --> 45:27.340
He came into my home last night.
My wife was terrified.

45:27.440 --> 45:29.500
- Who?
- He didn't give his name.

45:29.600 --> 45:31.980
He said Abdi was dead. He was an Arab.

45:32.080 --> 45:36.260
He wanted the decitabine
and wanted me to go to the patient.

45:36.360 --> 45:37.460
- Where?
- Didn't say.

45:37.560 --> 45:39.060
Why are you still here?

45:39.160 --> 45:41.522
- Uh...
- You asked for more money, didn't you?

45:42.320 --> 45:44.820
- How much?
- 30,000.

45:44.920 --> 45:46.900
You're a successful doctor.

45:47.000 --> 45:50.700
You're going somewhere you don't
know to treat someone you don't know

45:50.800 --> 45:54.686
for a lousy 30,000 euros.
What am I missing here?

45:55.800 --> 45:57.365
Well...

46:00.760 --> 46:02.530
it's my wife.

46:03.960 --> 46:05.650
She's from Kenya.

46:06.600 --> 46:08.220
They said they'll kill her family

46:08.320 --> 46:11.060
- if I didn't come.
- The Arab man who told you this,

46:11.160 --> 46:13.840
is he planning on traveling with you?

46:15.200 --> 46:16.890
I assume so.

46:18.200 --> 46:20.340
You think Cornel will contact us
when they call him?

46:20.440 --> 46:22.700
Yeah, he'll call.
We've got him scared now.

46:22.800 --> 46:24.380
We're his only chance.

46:24.480 --> 46:27.580
Is there really a Natalie
Negrescu at SRI?

46:27.680 --> 46:31.043
He's not gonna contact
the Romanian authorities.

46:47.040 --> 46:49.700
Get this Cornel.

46:49.800 --> 46:51.420
He...

46:51.520 --> 46:53.420
he is a crook.

46:53.520 --> 46:56.980
30,000. Who does he think he is, eh?

46:57.080 --> 47:00.762
I wouldn't trust him if he wasn't.

47:02.520 --> 47:07.248
He only wants 15,000 now, so...

47:08.520 --> 47:09.860
he has to come.

47:09.960 --> 47:11.340
Can we get that much money?

47:11.440 --> 47:13.820
I will write the details.

47:13.920 --> 47:17.780
You... you go send it
from the internet cafe.

47:17.880 --> 47:19.900
It will take at least...

47:20.000 --> 47:23.420
at least a day,
but first we'll ask for more time.

47:23.520 --> 47:26.460
You tell him... no. No, I...

47:26.560 --> 47:29.843
I don't have time.

47:36.560 --> 47:37.966
Evan.

47:42.560 --> 47:44.125
Evan.

48:55.160 --> 48:57.362
31.

48:59.960 --> 49:02.049
44.

49:04.240 --> 49:06.363
31.

49:07.840 --> 49:09.565
35.

49:10.400 --> 49:13.171
Fuck. 24.

49:16.320 --> 49:17.965
17.

49:20.200 --> 49:21.925
10.

49:22.760 --> 49:24.405
Three.

49:32.520 --> 49:34.006
Are you...

49:36.080 --> 49:37.930
you warm enough?

49:42.040 --> 49:46.323
I asked you to tell me
if you were going out.

49:47.120 --> 49:50.605
I got anxious, kept walking.

49:52.200 --> 49:54.020
But the thing was I...

49:54.120 --> 49:58.564
I-I... I couldn't remember
the name of the hotel.

50:02.720 --> 50:05.764
You left your wallet.

50:15.640 --> 50:18.207
It's just three blocks over.

50:22.360 --> 50:23.800
You get some sleep.

50:24.640 --> 50:27.161
You'll be fine.

50:28.120 --> 50:30.140
It happens towards the end of the day.

50:30.240 --> 50:32.500
Sundowning it's called.

50:32.600 --> 50:35.220
Nobody knows why.

50:35.320 --> 50:38.410
You get anxious, confused.

50:39.200 --> 50:42.450
I had to get out, go somewhere.

50:44.280 --> 50:46.608
You take your medication?

50:50.600 --> 50:52.260
Do you feel better?

50:52.360 --> 50:53.660
Yeah.

50:53.760 --> 50:55.803
Yeah, I just slipped.

50:56.600 --> 51:00.122
Lost track. I'm... I'm all right.

51:01.680 --> 51:04.406
Dr. Cornel called.

51:05.640 --> 51:07.620
The money will arrive tomorrow.

51:07.720 --> 51:10.660
They said to be ready
to travel in a few days,

51:10.760 --> 51:13.201
had to get him a Kenyan visa.

51:14.640 --> 51:16.580
Banir's Arab friend?

51:16.680 --> 51:18.211
Yeah.

51:21.960 --> 51:25.642
Do you remember... what he looked like?

51:26.440 --> 51:28.540
- Who?
- Banir.

51:28.640 --> 51:32.447
Of course. I can see him now.

51:34.400 --> 51:36.820
Back then when you were...

51:36.920 --> 51:37.940
a captive,

51:38.040 --> 51:41.420
Banir wanted a name, right?

51:41.520 --> 51:43.660
Why didn't you give him a name?

51:43.760 --> 51:47.100
It didn't matter which name, any name.

51:47.200 --> 51:50.340
It just pissed him off more,

51:50.440 --> 51:52.210
hurt the man's pride.

51:53.200 --> 51:58.041
If you'd have given him a name,
he probably would've said, "Good"...

51:58.840 --> 52:00.820
and let you go.

52:00.920 --> 52:05.247
I didn't want to be the man who
gave up a name under questioning.

52:11.840 --> 52:13.780
Come on, hotel's this way.

52:13.880 --> 52:15.540
Let's go. It's gonna start snowing.

52:15.640 --> 52:17.340
I know where the damn hotel is.

52:17.440 --> 52:19.420
Stop trying to put a bib on me, okay?

52:19.520 --> 52:21.609
Okay.

52:37.680 --> 52:39.120
It's a quarter past.

52:41.840 --> 52:44.042
Okay, he's got the money.

53:19.240 --> 53:21.204
Shit, he's seen us.

54:08.280 --> 54:09.845
Hey!

54:10.640 --> 54:12.260
The airplane ticket and the money.

54:12.360 --> 54:13.766
Okay.

54:16.600 --> 54:19.300
- And the passport.
- Just give me a second.

54:19.400 --> 54:22.220
You are out of this.
You dodged a bullet.

54:22.320 --> 54:25.171
Nothing's gonna happen
to you or your people.

54:26.040 --> 54:28.004
Now you can go.

55:31.560 --> 55:33.180
Any word from Aasim?

55:33.280 --> 55:35.926
The doctor will arrive on Wednesday.

55:36.800 --> 55:39.180
After that... nothing?

55:39.280 --> 55:40.891
Not yet.

55:43.840 --> 55:45.530
No, no. No, no.

55:46.560 --> 55:48.922
Just a few more moments.

56:00.440 --> 56:02.449
What was his phone number again?

56:03.640 --> 56:08.448
254-41 -834-5571.

56:09.240 --> 56:10.601
Where is that?

56:15.240 --> 56:19.740
- Mombasa.
- The asshole of East Africa.

56:19.840 --> 56:23.060
That's exactly where someone
like Banir would end up.

56:23.160 --> 56:25.660
That's where Cornel
will meet with Banir.

56:25.760 --> 56:28.531
- When?
- Tuesday.

56:29.920 --> 56:31.820
We gotta make Banir think this...

56:31.920 --> 56:33.940
- what was his name?
- Aasim.

56:34.040 --> 56:35.540
...is still alive.

56:35.640 --> 56:40.248
Well, all the messages are texts,
so we can text.

56:43.960 --> 56:45.730
Yeah, Michelle?

56:46.920 --> 56:48.500
Yeah, me too.

56:48.600 --> 56:51.280
Look, Milt needs a Kenyan visa.

56:52.440 --> 56:54.140
As soon as possible.

56:54.240 --> 56:56.249
And there's another thing.

56:57.520 --> 56:59.340
After the base is down,

56:59.440 --> 57:03.122
just tone it down
a little with a cotton ball.

57:04.000 --> 57:06.140
Are you taking this down?

57:06.240 --> 57:08.460
All right, this whole process

57:08.560 --> 57:11.180
should take about two hours
for the first time

57:11.280 --> 57:14.420
and will last the better part
of a shooting day.

57:14.520 --> 57:18.060
Serban works on motion pictures
when he isn't helping us out.

57:18.160 --> 57:21.980
So if you feel insecure or need
a little bit of an ego boost,

57:22.080 --> 57:24.020
Serban is the man for you.

57:24.120 --> 57:26.500
The world is not a pretty place
without makeup.

57:26.600 --> 57:28.290
Hmm.

57:30.440 --> 57:33.620
The eye color is pretty different.

57:33.720 --> 57:37.686
No. No, I don't want contacts.

57:39.480 --> 57:42.580
Fortunately, our man wears glasses,

57:42.680 --> 57:46.441
so I've added a little tint to these.

57:52.920 --> 57:56.060
Dr. Iulian Cornel.

57:56.160 --> 57:59.330
I was able to expedite your Kenyan visa.

58:00.400 --> 58:03.380
Serban. What exactly did you see?

58:03.480 --> 58:05.569
I didn't see anything.

58:08.400 --> 58:09.886
Thank you.

58:14.840 --> 58:16.620
Your visa.

58:16.720 --> 58:18.700
You might want to keep it
to yourself for a day.

58:18.800 --> 58:21.500
- Why?
- Give Evan another day

58:21.600 --> 58:23.245
to think about what he's doing.

58:24.160 --> 58:27.170
He's been thinking
about it for 20 years.

58:28.080 --> 58:29.281
22.

58:34.560 --> 58:36.340
Evan has retired.

58:36.440 --> 58:38.580
It's his life, his choice, but you...

58:38.680 --> 58:41.660
no matter how this turns out,
it will end badly for you.

58:41.760 --> 58:44.020
Your career will be over.

58:44.120 --> 58:47.300
All my life, I wanted to be
in the foreign service.

58:47.400 --> 58:50.763
It was killing me,
being strapped to a desk.

58:52.000 --> 58:55.249
- You should tell him.
- I tried.

58:56.160 --> 58:58.089
He's made his choice.

59:39.880 --> 59:41.780
What's his name?

59:41.880 --> 59:43.570
What is the name?

59:46.760 --> 59:48.803
You want to...

01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:21.620
Michelle had to run.

01:00:21.720 --> 01:00:24.380
She was able to get my visa. I have it.

01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:28.340
I was watching TV. Something about
a body on University campus.

01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:32.180
Let's pack up, go to a
hotel near the airport,

01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:35.100
stay in the room
until the flight leaves.

01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:39.060
Just before the flight,
text Banir from Aasim's phone,

01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:42.409
Aasim says he's been
detained by security.

01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:46.260
What about Michelle?

01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:48.620
Are you gonna tell Michelle?

01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:50.763
What did she ask?

01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:53.889
Did she say anything about me?

01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:59.965
- No.
- Don't tell her how the story ends.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:10.765
Flight 418 is now
boarding at gate seven.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:16.250
Flight 418 now boarding at gate seven.

01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:48.564
I am Dr. Cornel.

01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:51.820
- Dr. Cornel.
- Yes.

01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:53.220
- Julian Cornel?
- Yes.

01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:55.220
I am Mbui. So glad you could come.

01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:57.540
I'll take you to Dr. Wangari's office.

01:01:57.640 --> 01:01:59.842
Where is Aasim?

01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:02.340
He is coming.

01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:05.211
Flight 273 now arriving.

01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:24.140
When did Mr. Ali Hariri
have his last transfusion?

01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:25.940
Three days ago.

01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:27.660
When is he scheduled for another?

01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:29.380
Three days.

01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:31.205
Here at the clinic?

01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:37.180
Saeed Ali Hariri is being
treated at his own residence.

01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:40.380
- I will see him here.
- Dr. Cornel,

01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:42.580
you were given letter
with all explained.

01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:46.900
- We wrote this.
- I am just double checking.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.700
Al-Hariri is not able
to leave his residence.

01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:52.580
You requested additional payment
in the light of this.

01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:55.540
Of course. Let me go through
everything tonight.

01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:56.860
These are for me, correct?

01:02:56.960 --> 01:03:01.420
Then tomorrow I will visit
Mr. Ali Hariri at his residence.

01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:03.140
Will you be coming, doctor?

01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:05.540
Dr. Wangari will not be able to join us.

01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:09.049
I'll pick you up at the hotel, 4:00 p.m.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:24.420
All right, I'll give you
750 for the Jericho,

01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:27.260
- 900 for the Glock.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:29.300
- 1150 for the Glock.
- 1150?

01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:30.780
- Yeah.
- Okay, just stop.

01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:33.620
Here's what we do.
900... 900 for the Jericho...

01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:35.100
- No, no, no, no, no.
- ...950 for the Glock.

01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:36.420
All right? No, that's fair.

01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:38.290
No, no, no, no,
it's not fair, it's not fair.

01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:50.160
Mbui.

01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:52.140
Yes, Shaykh.

01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:55.569
Come, come.

01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:58.329
Closer, closer, closer.

01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:01.925
Shh.

01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:06.540
Aasim is missing.

01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:08.300
Abdi is dead.

01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:10.900
If there is a traitor among us,
I will find him.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.726
Is it you? Is it you?

01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:15.740
No, Shaykh.

01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:17.140
800, 900.

01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:18.340
- No.
- No? All right, look,

01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:20.140
this is 2,000 euros right here.

01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:22.580
2,000 euros right here, okay?

01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:25.380
Don't underestimate me.

01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:29.660
I have survived much more than this.

01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:32.700
I went shopping at the market.

01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:34.900
A Jericho 941...

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.601
and a Glock.

01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:42.442
How much?

01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:46.449
2,000 euros.

01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:49.580
You got took.

01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:53.780
Well, we've got euros to spare.

01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:55.764
Do you smell something?

01:04:56.920 --> 01:04:58.531
Mombasa.

01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:03.140
The other night when
we were in the park in Bucharest,

01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:04.940
I touched your jacket.

01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:06.500
You were wearing this...

01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:09.900
this blue, like canvas jacket,

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:11.300
but when I touched it,

01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:14.080
it... it felt just like dog fur.

01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:18.540
Isn't it strange when you can't
even trust your own fingers?

01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:21.366
And don't ask me how I feel.

01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:23.860
I wouldn't think of it.

01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:25.924
Crock.

01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:30.220
Evan.

01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:32.020
Crock is...

01:05:32.120 --> 01:05:33.220
gun.

01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:36.660
No way I'll be able to bring
a gun with me tomorrow.

01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:38.460
Mbui frisked me today.

01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:40.091
He'll frisk me again tomorrow.

01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:42.730
Well, how do you plan to do it?

01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:47.660
It's been so long, I've thought
about it so long, I'm not sure.

01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:50.850
Maybe I'll just let the moment guide me.

01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:53.740
I've got a syringe and medication.

01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:57.020
One's quick and painless,
the other's a strychnine derivative...

01:05:57.120 --> 01:05:58.980
excruciating, takes over an hour.

01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:01.580
Or maybe I'll just get up close to him,

01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:04.360
slice him and let his blood
wash all over me.

01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:09.260
I don't feel comfortable
letting you go in there alone.

01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:13.060
- I'll be all right.
- Look, I picked this up at the market.

01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:15.660
They're wireless crazy over here.

01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:19.060
Jumped straight from
tom-toms to cellphones.

01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:21.140
Just tuck that in somewhere,

01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:24.060
I'll be able to hear you
and I'll get GPS as well.

01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:26.260
I brought a belt blade.

01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:29.131
I'll be able to get that through,
but that's about it.

01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:36.248
- So that's that then?
- Yeah.

01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:38.566
Milt...

01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:41.260
thanks for coming along.

01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:43.642
No problem, old sport.

01:07:15.560 --> 01:07:19.290
If I'm not out in an hour,
do whatever you want.

01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:45.406
Please.

01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:50.020
- Did you sleep well?
- All right.

01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:52.561
Sometimes the heat is a problem.

01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:57.330
Come, doctor.

01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:07.490
Open the briefcase.

01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:09.300
Dr. Cornel.

01:09:09.399 --> 01:09:11.100
Salaam alaikum.

01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:13.620
Salaam alaikum, Saeed Ali Hariri.

01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:16.819
Dr. Cornel, thank you.

01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:18.899
Thank you for coming.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:20.884
Forgive me for not...

01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:23.689
standing.

01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:26.969
Mbui, some tea.

01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:30.740
And those... those dates.

01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:32.979
Mind if I sit?

01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:34.964
Oh, please.

01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:43.620
Dr. Wangari has provided me
your records, your treatment history.

01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:46.899
Last night I was in contact
with several of my colleagues.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.167
Thank you.

01:09:51.359 --> 01:09:53.660
I noticed you were scheduled
three months ago

01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:57.540
for a bone marrow transplant,
but I found no record of the procedure.

01:09:57.640 --> 01:09:59.540
Was there a problem with the donor?

01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:04.140
- It was too dangerous.
- Uh, no sibling donor was possible,

01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:06.460
no compatible cousins.

01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:10.700
It is risky, but an unrelated donor

01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:15.050
can be found based on HLB
and DR histocompatibility.

01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:22.660
The university hospital
can assist in finding such a donor.

01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:24.962
We have a large database.

01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:27.820
Should have been done before.

01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:29.540
It is more...

01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:32.620
dangerous now, but we have no choice.

01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:35.060
At present, transplantation is

01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:37.840
the only possible curative therapy.

01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:40.820
And...

01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:43.100
it can be done here?

01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:45.050
Yes.

01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:51.620
Excuse me, I am not such a young man.

01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:53.580
Where is the toilet?

01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:56.300
Back and to the left.

01:10:56.400 --> 01:10:57.740
So sorry.

01:10:57.840 --> 01:10:59.929
Oh, please. Please.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:30.060
There is a problem with the toilet.

01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:32.567
Mmm. Mbui.

01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:40.060
It won't flush.

01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:43.250
- You pulled the chain?
- I pulled the chain.

01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:48.246
There is something stuck... in there.

01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:23.608
I have to be honest.

01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:29.248
Your condition is far
worse than I imagined.

01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:37.605
Your long-term chances for
survival are not good.

01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:42.762
Neither are your short-term chances.

01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:50.366
In fact, they are quite hopeless.

01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:55.449
It's because I'm not a doctor.

01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:04.526
My name isn't Julian Cornel...

01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:08.451
and your name isn't Ali Hariri.

01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:10.500
Your name...

01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:12.962
is Muhammad Banir.

01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:27.884
Mr. Ruchowski.

01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:31.484
Evan Lake.

01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:38.131
- Mbui?
- He'll be all right.

01:13:40.280 --> 01:13:41.780
Where is your backup?

01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:44.890
Hmm? Your elite commandos.

01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:48.805
Oh. You came alone.

01:13:55.040 --> 01:13:57.020
How did you find me?

01:13:57.120 --> 01:13:59.380
Through the request for experimental

01:13:59.480 --> 01:14:02.331
thalassemia medication, decitabine.

01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:05.140
Your family medical history.

01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:06.820
It was you.

01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:11.540
Hmm? You who sent me into hiding.

01:14:11.640 --> 01:14:14.180
Even so for years and years

01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:17.370
I live in rooms like this one.

01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:22.363
I would have gladly given
both my ears for my freedom.

01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:28.531
So my health...

01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:31.780
- is it really hopeless?
- Yes.

01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:34.970
You would've died of anemia
just like your father.

01:14:39.680 --> 01:14:42.201
He was an intellectual scholar.

01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:46.927
I... I've read quite a bit myself.

01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:51.085
Yeah.

01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:55.284
So...

01:14:58.400 --> 01:14:59.840
how are...

01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:02.963
how are you going to kill me?

01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:06.528
L-I... I don't know.

01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:10.100
Good.

01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:13.449
Ah. So...

01:15:15.480 --> 01:15:17.603
we have some time.

01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:20.085
Perhaps we can have that...

01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:25.580
conversation that I wanted to
have that time years a-ago.

01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:27.245
Huh?

01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:29.460
You... you only kept giving me

01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:30.966
your fake name. Why?

01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:35.650
- I was making a point.
- What point?

01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:39.723
What is it that you do now?

01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:42.220
This company?

01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:45.740
Intelligence analyst, yes?

01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:48.884
Perhaps you've read some of my writings?

01:15:53.480 --> 01:15:55.460
I didn't know you were still active.

01:15:55.560 --> 01:15:57.620
Oh, I-I-I, uh...

01:15:57.720 --> 01:15:58.940
I contribute.

01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:01.700
A number of web sites not under my name.

01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:05.740
Of course, you are
religious man, Mr. Lake?

01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:08.620
No, I'm not religious.

01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:10.260
I think you are.

01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:12.620
America, yeah?

01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:14.500
You see yourself
as a religion... America.

01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:18.340
I've written about this,
the American way of life.

01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:19.740
Huh?

01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:21.620
Have you been to Greeley, Colorado?

01:16:21.720 --> 01:16:24.820
- You know what I'm talking about?
- Sayyid Qutb...

01:16:24.920 --> 01:16:29.100
who went from Cairo to Colorado
State College in 1948.

01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:32.020
He said Greeley was
like paradise on earth.

01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:36.940
What Qutb saw was jahiliyyah, huh?

01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:40.020
Decadence, promiscuity, pop music.

01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:42.004
"Baby, it's Cold Outside."

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.900
Qutb was repulsed.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.300
The-the... the flirting

01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:53.580
and the mixing of men and women,

01:16:53.680 --> 01:16:55.900
the disrespect... so no, he left.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:00.410
Went back to Egypt
and the movement was born.

01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:02.726
The Muslim Brotherhood.

01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:06.860
My father knew him.

01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:09.620
No, Nasser...

01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:11.684
Nasser executed him.

01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:14.489
It was too late.

01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:21.500
45. 38.

01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:23.643
It was too late.

01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:26.700
Fundamentalism,

01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:29.700
- Mr. Lake, of the prophet...
- 170.

01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:31.940
- ...was social justice!
- 38.

01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:36.569
Better schools, better jobs, Mr. Lake.

01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:39.767
This doesn't just... just end.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.980
Are you still a believer?

01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:46.408
Hmm? Do you still believe?

01:17:47.720 --> 01:17:49.100
I don't.

01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:51.020
My faith, it was...

01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:53.620
it was taken from me.

01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:57.380
You think I'm playing games
with you, Mr. Lake?

01:17:57.480 --> 01:17:58.980
Huh?

01:17:59.080 --> 01:18:01.820
You think we are playing games?!

01:18:01.920 --> 01:18:03.580
No, my name is Charles Ruchowski.

01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:05.460
While mullahs, ayatollahs,
they get rich.

01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:06.940
I'm a representative for Spirit Systems.

01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:09.060
They have their orgies,
imprison their opponents.

01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:10.460
- Why? Hmm? Why?!
- I'm Charles Ruchowski.

01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:13.100
My name is Charles Ruchowski.

01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:16.802
I'm a representative for Spirit Systems.

01:18:19.560 --> 01:18:21.420
The only hope

01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:22.820
for Islam now

01:18:22.920 --> 01:18:25.726
is Marx, hmm?

01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:29.140
Social justice.

01:18:29.240 --> 01:18:31.340
We like the fear. I like the fear.

01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:33.340
I like the fear.

01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:36.900
Our believers, not so many.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:40.780
No, the truly dangerous people

01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:42.540
are the ones who follow orders.

01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:44.968
Do you think it made any difference?

01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:49.567
What you did! You!

01:18:53.400 --> 01:18:55.648
Do you?

01:18:59.480 --> 01:19:02.500
Now, what is the name

01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:05.007
of the source, Mr. Lake?!

01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:11.820
Ah. You are sick too. Hmm?

01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:14.043
I see it, your face.

01:19:14.840 --> 01:19:17.042
You have a disease of the blood.

01:19:17.960 --> 01:19:20.180
My disease is in the brain.

01:19:20.280 --> 01:19:22.562
What sort of disease?

01:19:23.960 --> 01:19:26.460
I'm forgetting things.

01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:28.250
Ohhh.

01:19:29.640 --> 01:19:31.729
There is a lot to forget.

01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:41.848
It's the time for prayer.

01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:48.540
Will you... please help me?

01:19:48.640 --> 01:19:50.968
No, I won't do that!

01:19:53.680 --> 01:19:55.370
So...

01:19:58.680 --> 01:20:01.121
so what are you going to do... to do?

01:20:06.920 --> 01:20:08.780
I'm going to leave.

01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:10.900
Just like that?

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:12.884
Just like that.

01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:17.768
- Ma'a salama.
- Ma'a salama.

01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:32.166
Evan.

01:20:39.920 --> 01:20:41.140
Milt.

01:20:41.240 --> 01:20:43.408
What happened?

01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:52.123
- Was it worth it?
- Yeah, it was worth it.

01:20:53.080 --> 01:20:55.248
You should've heard him scream.

01:20:57.560 --> 01:20:59.285
Put the car in gear.

01:21:12.440 --> 01:21:14.620
God, I hate this time of day.

01:21:14.720 --> 01:21:17.127
It's the worst.

01:21:18.280 --> 01:21:20.448
You want to have a drink?

01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:45.606
Outside. Let's walk.

01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:48.940
Later on...

01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:50.500
you wanna talk about it?

01:21:50.600 --> 01:21:52.620
What are you gonna do?

01:21:52.720 --> 01:21:55.740
Go home, I guess. So should you.

01:21:55.840 --> 01:21:59.660
- What home?
- Oh come on, don't be melodramatic.

01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:03.380
You'll retire. You're young,
there's tons of things you could do.

01:22:03.480 --> 01:22:05.780
Or don't retire.
They won't put it together...

01:22:05.880 --> 01:22:08.180
Bucharest, Mombasa.

01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:10.940
- They won't want to.
- Nah.

01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:12.571
It was always my dream to...

01:24:17.320 --> 01:24:19.682
Salaam alaikum, asshole.

01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:28.689
That boy you shot was my friend.

01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:34.820
What the fuck does that mean?

01:24:34.920 --> 01:24:37.088
- Come closer. Come on.
- Okay.

01:26:17.680 --> 01:26:19.644
What the hell are you doing here?

01:26:21.680 --> 01:26:23.530
Haven't you heard?

01:26:25.720 --> 01:26:28.740
The CIA fell from the Berlin Wall

01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:32.487
and all the president's men
can't put it back together again!

01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:35.540
It's broke!

01:26:35.640 --> 01:26:37.700
Not reliable. Not trustworthy.

01:26:37.800 --> 01:26:39.740
Can't stand up to the White House.

01:26:39.840 --> 01:26:41.620
Backstabbers.

01:26:41.720 --> 01:26:44.660
Watching porn, tapping phones.

01:26:44.760 --> 01:26:47.645
Best and brightest quit or retired.

01:26:48.720 --> 01:26:52.500
What in the name of
Jesus Christ nailed to the cross

01:26:52.600 --> 01:26:54.450
are you doing here?

01:26:58.960 --> 01:27:00.685
Values.

01:27:02.200 --> 01:27:05.140
The CIA has taken some hits,

01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:07.260
some deserved.

01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:11.020
We've been down on the canvas,
but we're on our feet again,

01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:14.140
because we've got no choice
and because our country needs us

01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:16.442
and because we've got what?

01:27:18.600 --> 01:27:20.643
Values.

01:27:21.305 --> 01:27:27.900
