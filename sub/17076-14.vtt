12:01.488 --> 12:03.388
- lieutenant, I'm a little cold.

12:03.390 --> 12:06.825
Mind if I go in
and get some soup?

12:06.827 --> 12:08.793
- What?
- It's freezing out here.

12:08.795 --> 12:10.895
Gotta warm up or not gonna be
any good to anyone.

12:10.897 --> 12:13.431
Trust me.

12:16.970 --> 12:19.771
- Hundley's been floating
longer than I have.

12:19.773 --> 12:22.841
Thinks it gives him
some kind of seniority.

12:22.843 --> 12:24.042
- You're a floater?

12:24.044 --> 12:27.078
- Oh, yeah.
All of us are.

12:27.080 --> 12:29.514
Never been able
to find a permanent house.

12:29.516 --> 12:31.449
Till now.

12:31.451 --> 12:33.752
Yeah, okay.

12:33.754 --> 12:36.121
- You're kidding me.
[cell phone vibrates]

12:38.158 --> 12:40.158
- oh, look out!

12:40.160 --> 12:43.762
Damn it.
Sorry, lieutenant.

12:53.774 --> 12:55.240
<i> - Kelly, it's dennis mack</i>

12:55.242 --> 12:57.208
<i> from springfield</i>
<i> fire department.</i>

12:57.210 --> 12:59.144
<i> I haven't heard back from you.</i>

12:59.146 --> 13:02.080
<i> Wanted to know if you'd</i>
<i> given my offer any thought.</i>

13:02.082 --> 13:04.449
<i> No pressure, but I would like</i>
<i> to get an answer</i>

13:04.451 --> 13:07.252
<i> in the next couple of days.</i>

13:14.427 --> 13:16.795
- So this high school girl,
right, she's trapped

13:16.797 --> 13:18.496
in the warehouse,
this 2,000-gallon jug

13:18.498 --> 13:20.031
is pierced by a forklift.

13:20.032 --> 13:21.565
It's leaking toxic acid
all over the place.

13:21.568 --> 13:23.034
All I can think is,

13:23.036 --> 13:24.569
"I gotta figure out
a way out of here

13:24.571 --> 13:26.571
or we're both dead."
- well, what'd you do?

13:26.573 --> 13:29.440
- Well,
acid is spilling towards

13:29.442 --> 13:31.075
these little metal filings
out the front door,

13:31.077 --> 13:33.578
we can't go that way.
The room next door is toxic,

13:33.580 --> 13:35.247
can't go that way.

13:35.248 --> 13:36.915
I got about a foot of concrete
on the back wall.

13:36.917 --> 13:38.983
Now, I'm using a chair leg
to chip at it,

13:38.985 --> 13:40.451
but this is gonna take too long.

13:40.453 --> 13:42.453
- Oh, my god,
this is amazing, brian.

13:42.455 --> 13:43.988
- Suddenly, my eyes,

13:43.990 --> 13:45.523
they level
on a fire extinguisher

13:45.525 --> 13:46.858
in the corner.

13:46.860 --> 13:49.160
[knocks on door]

13:49.162 --> 13:51.863
- hey.
- Hey.

13:53.033 --> 13:56.134
- I talked to a crony
in personnel...

13:56.136 --> 13:59.838
And chief jackson
down at headquarters.

13:59.840 --> 14:01.606
They both said the same thing.

14:01.608 --> 14:03.107
They'd love to help,

14:03.109 --> 14:05.510
they respect you,

14:05.512 --> 14:07.612
there's nothing they can do.

14:07.614 --> 14:10.315
Anderson's got more bugles
on his collar.

14:10.317 --> 14:13.017
- You know, I keep going through
this thing in my mind,

14:13.019 --> 14:16.855
and I do not know
how it escalated so fast.

14:16.857 --> 14:18.122
- [scoffs]

14:18.124 --> 14:20.091
he's an angry bull

14:20.093 --> 14:23.061
and you just happened to be
the red cape of the day.

14:23.063 --> 14:27.031
- But doesn't that bull
usually get...

14:27.033 --> 14:30.101
You know, after the fight?
- What do you want me to say?

14:30.103 --> 14:31.636
I called everybody
I thought could help.

14:31.638 --> 14:34.038
- [sighs]

14:34.040 --> 14:36.908
I appreciate it, tom.

14:40.146 --> 14:43.882
- You want my advice?
- What?

14:43.884 --> 14:46.517
- Lay low for awhile.

14:46.519 --> 14:49.554
Six months...

14:49.556 --> 14:51.222
A year.

14:51.224 --> 14:52.924
Let anderson
find another target,

14:52.926 --> 14:56.361
and when he's distracted,

14:56.363 --> 15:00.131
take another shot
at getting your crew back.

15:00.133 --> 15:02.600
- Thanks, tom.

15:10.076 --> 15:12.277
[brush scratching]
- I've had boots that are

15:12.279 --> 15:15.213
smarter than you are, chapman,
and definitely more useful.

15:15.215 --> 15:18.283
Hey, you wanna serve
in my firehouse,

15:18.285 --> 15:20.285
I got some good advice,

15:20.287 --> 15:23.021
why don't you quit?
Reapply as a janitor.

15:23.023 --> 15:26.024
- Hey!
Enough.

15:26.026 --> 15:29.027
She's a candidate,
she's new at this,

15:29.029 --> 15:30.595
and she would be
much better served

15:30.597 --> 15:32.297
with carrots instead of sticks.

15:32.299 --> 15:34.299
We all would.

15:34.301 --> 15:36.401
- Oh, yeah?

15:36.403 --> 15:39.604
You ladies, you really
stick together, don't you?

15:39.606 --> 15:40.939
You know what?
I'm glad

15:40.941 --> 15:42.640
that your back in my house.

15:42.642 --> 15:44.642
'cause I'm gonna make your life
a living hell

15:44.644 --> 15:46.577
as long as you're
under this roof.

15:46.579 --> 15:48.579
Oh, and...
[grunts]

15:48.581 --> 15:51.349
you are gonna clean
the rest of the grout,

15:51.351 --> 15:53.051
and when you're done with that,
you're gonna clean the shower,

15:53.053 --> 15:55.387
and when you're done with that,

15:55.388 --> 15:57.722
you're gonna empty
the grease trap in the kitchen!

15:57.724 --> 16:00.325
- Yeah.
- If any of you help her,

16:00.327 --> 16:02.360
you'll be on hose duty
for the rest of the week.

16:02.362 --> 16:05.630
Are we clear?

16:05.632 --> 16:06.698
Welcome back.

16:11.972 --> 16:14.272
- [whispers] stella...
- [whispers] no.

16:18.345 --> 16:20.044
- [sighs]

16:29.556 --> 16:29.754
.

16:29.756 --> 16:31.890
- So how's your partner?

16:31.891 --> 16:34.025
- Uh, well,
I just close my eyes

16:34.027 --> 16:36.627
and I whisper to myself,
"it's all gonna be okay.

16:36.629 --> 16:39.097
It's all gonna be okay."
[all chuckle]

16:39.099 --> 16:41.566

- Well, I got chout.

16:41.568 --> 16:43.334
- Hm.
- Yeah.

16:43.336 --> 16:45.320
It's like a unicorn
mixed with a rainbow

16:45.321 --> 16:47.305
mixed with a dolphin drunk
on red bull and mountain dew.

16:47.307 --> 16:48.539
- Ooh.

16:48.541 --> 16:50.441
- It's kind of adorable,
actually.

16:52.412 --> 16:55.713
- Missy.
Hey.

16:55.715 --> 16:59.083
Oh, so glad you stopped by.

16:59.085 --> 17:01.319
Molly's is the best.

17:01.321 --> 17:03.488
It's our favorite hangout.

17:03.490 --> 17:05.623
- Hey.
- This is dawson.

17:05.625 --> 17:07.091
Both: Hey.
- Uh, you know brett.

17:07.093 --> 17:08.126
- Hey, sweetie.
- Hi.

17:08.128 --> 17:11.062
- This is missy.
Um...

17:11.064 --> 17:12.563
You want something to drink?

17:12.565 --> 17:15.366
- Uh, yeah.
Um...An ipa.

17:15.368 --> 17:17.735
- Yeah.
Otis!

17:17.737 --> 17:20.438
Will you get this girl an ipa?
- We're out.

17:20.440 --> 17:23.408
- Get her any beer!

17:27.514 --> 17:29.547
- When patterson was here,

17:29.549 --> 17:31.416
my dad dug up some dirt on him.

17:31.418 --> 17:33.518
Told me...

17:33.520 --> 17:36.587
"do whatever it takes
to survive on the job."

17:36.589 --> 17:39.340
- but you didn't use it.

17:39.341 --> 17:42.092
- No, but what's happening here
is way worse than that was.

17:42.095 --> 17:44.579
Maybe I should call benny

17:44.580 --> 17:47.064
and see what he can find
on chief anderson.

17:47.067 --> 17:50.068
- I don't wanna
argue against it...

17:50.070 --> 17:52.871
- But?

17:52.872 --> 17:55.673
- Well, boden is the original
"go high when they go low" man.

17:55.675 --> 17:57.575
No way is he gonna
sink in the mud.

17:57.577 --> 18:01.646
No matter what you bring him.

18:02.816 --> 18:06.451
- This is bad for business.

18:06.453 --> 18:08.853
- What're you gonna do?

18:08.855 --> 18:11.789
- I'm gonna cheer everybody up.

18:11.791 --> 18:14.192
Hey, listen up, everybody.

18:14.194 --> 18:16.561
Hey, listen up.
All right.

18:16.563 --> 18:20.698
I know it's looking bad for 51,

18:20.700 --> 18:24.435
but just remember that story
of that rabbit and that turtle.

18:24.437 --> 18:28.206
Slow and steady wins that race.

18:28.208 --> 18:30.208
Let's keep our chins up,
our heads down,

18:30.210 --> 18:33.811
and le--
let's ride this puppy out, okay?

18:33.813 --> 18:35.646
And most importantly,

18:35.648 --> 18:39.484
everybody, drink up.

18:40.587 --> 18:42.820
- [blows raspberry]

18:46.860 --> 18:50.528

18:50.530 --> 18:53.698
[grunts]
all right, okay.

18:53.700 --> 18:56.467
- So there's this crazy
pool party going on,

18:56.469 --> 19:00.671
hosted by travis brenner,
you know, the instagram king...

19:00.673 --> 19:03.441
Uh, anyway,
uh, so I scale the pole

19:03.443 --> 19:04.709
and I get this moron down

19:04.711 --> 19:06.210
before he gets turned
to a crispy critter...

19:06.212 --> 19:08.513
- [chuckles]
- and this brenner guy's like,

19:08.515 --> 19:10.581
"brian,
we should party sometime."

19:10.583 --> 19:14.485
- I thought that was
a squad call?

19:14.487 --> 19:17.522
- N--uh, no, it was,
uh--it was truck and squad.

19:17.524 --> 19:20.858
- You sure?
I saw it on the news.

19:21.794 --> 19:23.928
- Yeah, well, the news,

19:23.930 --> 19:25.930
uh...Can't show everything.

19:25.932 --> 19:29.167
- Geez, culotta,
let him finish his story.

19:29.169 --> 19:31.202
- [clears throat]
- go ahead, brian.

19:31.204 --> 19:34.939
- Uh, yeah, you know what?
I'm actually starving.

19:34.941 --> 19:36.207
I think I'm gonna get
some more of that spaghetti

19:36.209 --> 19:37.708
out of that 40-quart pot.

19:37.710 --> 19:39.944
- Cool.
[chuckles]

19:42.649 --> 19:44.248
- just burned out.
- Yeah.

19:44.250 --> 19:45.850
- No signs of life
in any of 'em.

19:45.852 --> 19:48.953
- No, there's nothing in there.
It's stupid as the day is long.

19:48.955 --> 19:51.289
I te--

19:56.296 --> 19:58.229
[thumping rhythmically]
- ah, yes!

19:58.231 --> 19:59.497
[laughter]
- aw, come on!

19:59.499 --> 20:00.965
- Double me up.
- I wanna watch this.

20:06.239 --> 20:08.673
- You ca--

20:08.675 --> 20:09.907

- no, no, no, no, no, no, no...

20:09.909 --> 20:11.275
- No.
- Not your fight right now.

20:11.277 --> 20:13.377
Come on, come on, come on.
- Don't--

20:14.214 --> 20:16.647
this is horrible, chief.

20:16.649 --> 20:19.517
They put us in a house
with a bunch of stiffs

20:19.519 --> 20:21.686
who don't respect the job.

20:21.688 --> 20:23.654
- And that is an understatement.

20:23.656 --> 20:26.591
The bunk room is
so disgustingly dirty--

20:26.593 --> 20:29.260
- I don't think they've
cleaned their truck in years.

20:29.262 --> 20:31.896
It stinks to high heaven.
- And, worst of all,

20:31.898 --> 20:34.665
they could give a flip
if they catch a fire,

20:34.667 --> 20:37.001
and I'm not going out
in a firehouse like that.

20:37.003 --> 20:40.271
We can still do this job
better than anybody.

20:40.273 --> 20:42.907
- You gotta get up
and do something, chief.

20:42.909 --> 20:45.276
- Come on.
I mean, you can't call somebody?

20:45.278 --> 20:47.245
Do something?

20:47.247 --> 20:48.746
I mean,
we're in dark times over here.

20:48.748 --> 20:52.984
- This can't stand.
- Aw, just get used to it!

20:55.288 --> 20:57.321
What?
You think I didn't try?

20:57.323 --> 20:59.390
You think I just sat here
at my desk and did nothing?

20:59.392 --> 21:02.293
- We--we didn't mean--we--
- I went to headquarters.

21:02.295 --> 21:03.928
Their hands are tied.

21:03.930 --> 21:06.831
Chief anderson can damn well
reassign firefighters.

21:06.833 --> 21:10.301
He outranks me!
- [growls]

21:10.303 --> 21:12.970

21:12.972 --> 21:16.774

21:16.776 --> 21:18.976
You get to keep this nice,

21:18.978 --> 21:21.279
with all your fine decorations.

21:21.281 --> 21:24.348
Mouch and me, we're the guys
that get put out to pasture.

21:24.350 --> 21:25.983
You were supposed
to look out for us!

21:25.985 --> 21:27.885
- What?
- You didn't do enough!

21:27.887 --> 21:30.855
- Okay, that's--that's enough.
Let's just cool it for a bit.

21:39.332 --> 21:41.065

Pull the blinds.

21:41.067 --> 21:43.034

21:43.036 --> 21:44.869

I mean, there's only so much pep

21:47.807 --> 21:50.441
I just need, like,
five minutes of alone time

- I'm sorry
to surprise you like this.

36:24.283 --> 36:26.316
- No, no, no, no.
Come on in, please.

36:26.318 --> 36:28.752
I'm glad to see
that you're okay.

36:28.753 --> 36:31.187
- [sighs, clears throat]
just some, um, smoke inhalation.

36:31.190 --> 36:33.190
- Well, that's great.
- Mm.

36:33.192 --> 36:34.624
Look, I don't know
if you're aware of this,

36:34.626 --> 36:36.259
but I work
in the mayor's office.

36:36.261 --> 36:38.662
Actually, I'm deputy mayor.

36:38.664 --> 36:40.664
- I had no idea.

36:40.666 --> 36:44.668
- That conference was
for the better chicago project.

36:44.670 --> 36:48.305
Your firefighters rescued
about 50 government leaders

36:48.307 --> 36:49.739
from all over chicago.

36:49.741 --> 36:52.576
Your men and women
were remarkable.

36:52.578 --> 36:54.644
Every one of 'em.

36:54.646 --> 36:56.246
- Thank you.

36:56.248 --> 36:59.249
They'll take great pride
in that.

36:59.251 --> 37:01.284
- Chief, I'm here because
I'd like to talk to the mayor

37:01.286 --> 37:04.654
about a commendation for you.

37:06.959 --> 37:09.659
- Actually...

37:09.661 --> 37:12.329
Mr. Cerrutti...

37:12.331 --> 37:15.665
There is something
that I would like...

37:15.667 --> 37:18.802
More than a medal.

37:18.804 --> 37:20.904
- Name it.

37:34.886 --> 37:36.920
- I don't know how you did it,

37:36.922 --> 37:39.856
but this is not over.

37:39.858 --> 37:43.860
- I did it by doing my job
to the best of my ability.

37:43.862 --> 37:46.830
I find that when I do that
good things follow.

37:46.832 --> 37:49.633
- You got lucky.
- [laughs]

37:49.635 --> 37:51.868
let me tell you something.

37:51.870 --> 37:54.604
When I was at the academy,
there was a pool hall

37:54.606 --> 37:56.740
on the corner
of jefferson and taylor.

37:56.742 --> 37:58.375
A few recruits and I
would play nine-ball

37:58.377 --> 37:59.943
for a couple of bucks a game.

37:59.945 --> 38:01.945
I would take a shot,

38:01.946 --> 38:03.946
cue ball would come
right back to the center,

38:03.949 --> 38:06.349
and they would say,

38:06.351 --> 38:09.352
"you got lucky."

38:09.354 --> 38:11.354
I kept taking their money,

38:11.356 --> 38:15.292
and they kept saying,
"you got lucky, wallace."

38:15.294 --> 38:17.694
this went on
for two solid weeks

38:17.696 --> 38:20.964
until, eventually,
they stopped playing me.

38:20.966 --> 38:24.034
Because maybe...

38:24.036 --> 38:27.370
It wasn't luck.

38:27.372 --> 38:30.473
- We're gonna see each other
again, wallace.

38:30.475 --> 38:34.044
I can promise you that.

38:34.046 --> 38:35.845
- Oh, yeah.

38:35.847 --> 38:37.947
I'll be ready.

38:42.921 --> 38:46.056
We'll use the laundry room
for the new equipment for now,

38:46.058 --> 38:47.924
and we are gonna have

38:47.926 --> 38:50.660
two elementary schools here
for field trips,

38:50.662 --> 38:53.396
so I want the apparatus floor
looking sharp.

38:53.398 --> 38:55.932
- That sounds like a squad job,
chief.

38:55.934 --> 38:59.803
[laughter]
- it's a 51 job, mouch.

39:01.873 --> 39:05.408
Look, everyone,
I just wanna say, um...

39:08.080 --> 39:11.381
I'm very glad you're back.

39:13.118 --> 39:15.785
And, uh...

39:15.787 --> 39:17.087
Ah, dismissed.
Get out.

39:17.089 --> 39:20.357
[laughter]

39:21.693 --> 39:23.426
- whoo!

39:33.972 --> 39:36.106
- Ah, what's for lunch?

39:36.108 --> 39:38.908
- Hot dogs!
[laughter]

39:43.048 --> 39:46.149
- anna, hey.

39:48.553 --> 39:51.755
Yeah, yeah, it's--

39:51.757 --> 39:53.990
it's been a tough couple days
around here,

39:53.992 --> 39:57.127
and...

39:57.129 --> 40:00.130
I got some clarity I needed.

40:00.132 --> 40:01.998
I--

40:02.000 --> 40:04.768
I've decided that...

40:04.770 --> 40:06.403
Chicago is my home,

40:06.405 --> 40:08.037
and as much as
I wanna be with you,

40:08.039 --> 40:10.607
I need to stay here.

40:16.081 --> 40:18.181
[sighs]
