CHEONMYEONG LOGISTICS

BLACK KNIGHT

00:46.046 --> 00:47.380
The target's dead.

01:44.437 --> 01:45.939
We have an incident in District 5-7.

01:45.939 --> 01:46.981
District--

01:48.233 --> 01:49.901
Fuck.

02:11.631 --> 02:13.299
<i>Are you the legendary 5-8?</i>

02:13.299 --> 02:15.552
I'm Sa-wol. Yoon Sa-wol.

02:20.014 --> 02:21.474
- 4-1.
-<i>Go ahead.</i>

02:21.474 --> 02:23.935
- Got a situation. Move it.
-<i>Got it.</i>

04:04.410 --> 04:05.662
Sergeant Lee.

04:07.413 --> 04:08.581
Let's get started.

04:09.749 --> 04:11.209
Come in.

04:21.386 --> 04:23.137
LIVING ROOM LIGHTS

04:48.871 --> 04:51.624
Looks like it's related to the kidnappings
in the General Districts.

04:51.624 --> 04:53.918
Be thorough as you investigate.

04:53.918 --> 04:55.503
Provide the report when you're done.

04:55.503 --> 04:58.298
We'll investigate.
I assure you that we'll be thorough.

04:59.966 --> 05:02.010
But the room, you're aware that...

05:02.593 --> 05:03.970
I'm aware of the consequences.

05:06.014 --> 05:07.140
Please don't say that.

05:07.765 --> 05:09.600
We're all on your side here, Major.

05:27.910 --> 05:28.995
Unni!

05:31.456 --> 05:33.082
He opened his eyes!

05:36.336 --> 05:39.130
Unni, the refugee boy is awake!

05:44.761 --> 05:46.346
Tell me what your name is.

05:47.972 --> 05:49.307
Sa-wol.

05:50.767 --> 05:52.101
Yoon Sa-wol.

06:06.199 --> 06:08.743
How do you feel? How's your head?

06:10.787 --> 06:11.871
<i>Yoon Sa-wol!</i>

06:22.715 --> 06:23.674
Where am I?

06:24.926 --> 06:26.636
Seul-ah. Where's Seul-ah?

06:29.347 --> 06:30.515
You can't move around yet.

06:30.515 --> 06:32.058
Why are you here?

06:34.560 --> 06:36.104
Let go. I have to go see Seul-ah.

06:37.438 --> 06:38.564
Let go! Let me go!

06:39.524 --> 06:40.608
The girl is dead.

06:40.608 --> 06:41.984
That's not true.

06:42.568 --> 06:44.112
You can't do anything over there anyway.

06:44.946 --> 06:46.030
Don't lie to me.

06:46.030 --> 06:47.740
I'll go see for myself.

06:49.409 --> 06:50.827
Let go.

06:51.869 --> 06:52.703
Let go of me!

07:11.347 --> 07:13.516
I think the bullet was stopped
by his skull.

07:14.267 --> 07:17.437
- If it really is what it appears to be--
- That's enough for today.

07:17.937 --> 07:19.689
Let's keep this between us for now.

07:20.231 --> 07:21.232
Okay.

07:21.774 --> 07:23.609
You want me to have a look at that?

07:23.609 --> 07:24.694
No, I'm fine.

07:54.182 --> 07:55.683
It's not just a rumor.

08:53.407 --> 08:59.830
MS. JUNG SEUL-AH'S CREMATION IS COMPLETE

09:09.757 --> 09:12.385
Didn't I tell you that this will break
if you stepped on it too hard?

09:12.385 --> 09:15.221
Last time I fixed it real good,
I made it sturdy,

09:15.221 --> 09:16.806
but you always bring it back in here.

09:16.806 --> 09:17.848
You mess around with it.

09:17.848 --> 09:20.142
Ugh, Gramps...

09:20.142 --> 09:23.229
You know I'm not the only person
using this groundwater pump.

09:23.229 --> 09:25.147
Everyone uses it,
different strengths and stuff.

09:25.147 --> 09:28.442
That's why it keeps getting broken.
You know it's true.

09:29.902 --> 09:31.779
You might be right.

09:31.779 --> 09:35.283
Okay, so how's the water?

09:35.283 --> 09:36.576
Is the flow strong?

09:37.159 --> 09:40.246
It's not so great these days.
The water just dribbles out.

09:41.372 --> 09:43.291
We, uh, gotta find a new place real soon.

09:44.250 --> 09:46.752
Well, they're pretty good
at finding groundwater.

09:46.752 --> 09:49.088
Take them and look for it together.

10:10.985 --> 10:13.571
Everything with Sa-wol
must have been difficult.

10:15.865 --> 10:18.534
It was a relief
knowing you were there for him,

10:19.076 --> 10:21.746
and I'm so glad
all of his friends were here too.

10:23.414 --> 10:26.167
So what's wrong?
Did something happen to him?

10:27.418 --> 10:30.588
SPECIAL DISTRICT

10:35.509 --> 10:38.929
<i>We are now at
the Government Building, Special District.</i>

10:43.809 --> 10:47.938
<i>We ask that the Special District workers
abide strictly by the working hours</i>

10:47.938 --> 10:52.026
<i>set by the government in order to prevent
an oversupply of oxygen.</i>

10:56.781 --> 10:58.240
I'm glad we're meeting so often now.

10:58.240 --> 11:00.034
I'm not sure glad is the feeling.

11:00.034 --> 11:01.494
Right this way.

11:04.872 --> 11:07.375
Should the victim's family
be allowed to investigate?

11:07.958 --> 11:09.043
How did you know that?

11:09.627 --> 11:10.795
Family pictures.

11:12.755 --> 11:14.382
You were beside the victim.

11:15.675 --> 11:16.884
And now I'm seeing you.

11:16.884 --> 11:20.429
We're taking your statement
about the incident at District 5-7.

11:20.429 --> 11:23.349
Deliveryman 5-8,
you were the first person to report it,

11:23.349 --> 11:25.226
that's why we brought you
to the meeting room

11:25.226 --> 11:27.061
instead of the investigation room.

11:27.061 --> 11:28.270
Let's get started.

11:32.692 --> 11:35.695
You've heard about the kidnappings
in the General Districts?

11:35.695 --> 11:36.612
Yes.

11:36.612 --> 11:38.489
What they all have in common

11:38.489 --> 11:41.450
is that the security cameras
in the district freeze up,

11:41.450 --> 11:44.995
and the memory cards in the houses
recording entry and exit disappear.

11:46.205 --> 11:49.083
However, what's different
about this instance is the fact that--

11:49.083 --> 11:50.042
There was a murder.

11:58.259 --> 11:59.135
Right.

11:59.969 --> 12:02.054
It's actually the only murder,

12:02.054 --> 12:04.640
and there's a witness
who had called in the case.

12:07.101 --> 12:09.812
If all of the victims open their doors
without any suspicion,

12:09.812 --> 12:13.107
then we can narrow down the person
on the other side of the door

12:14.483 --> 12:16.777
to their family, soldiers, or possibly...

12:18.195 --> 12:21.157
You brought me in as a witness,
and now I'm a suspect?

12:21.157 --> 12:24.285
Every deliverman's work
is recorded by the minute.

12:25.369 --> 12:27.204
That provides a solid alibi.

12:28.372 --> 12:30.332
I'm just leaving the possibility open.

12:32.126 --> 12:33.419
It's not unreasonable to think

12:33.419 --> 12:35.921
that you could have allowed
a level of access.

12:37.214 --> 12:39.008
You may have opened the door.

12:39.008 --> 12:42.762
You believe I helped the murderers
and then decided to report it all later?

12:42.762 --> 12:47.266
Then walk me through everything
you happened to see as the first reporter.

12:48.058 --> 12:49.393
I heard a gunshot...

12:53.606 --> 12:55.816
...and when I got inside, it was over.

13:02.281 --> 13:04.325
SIMULATION COMPLETE
FIVE DECEASED

13:04.325 --> 13:05.993
How many murders were there?

13:05.993 --> 13:08.037
Did no one ever count the bodies?

13:08.037 --> 13:10.790
The only bodies remaining
were the victim's bodies.

13:12.291 --> 13:15.419
Do you remember what they looked like?
Anything to help us?

13:18.714 --> 13:21.300
I'm not sure. It was an awful scene.

13:21.300 --> 13:23.844
Why did you leave the scene
before the military arrived?

13:23.844 --> 13:25.846
You know a deliveryman and his schedule.

13:27.765 --> 13:29.850
Timeliness is everything to us.

13:35.856 --> 13:37.274
Do I look like a joke to you?

13:37.274 --> 13:39.318
I think you're the one
who thinks I'm a joke.

13:39.318 --> 13:43.239
I know the simulation shows you the
movements of the culprits who were there.

13:44.448 --> 13:46.283
I think there's more you wanna know here.

13:47.201 --> 13:50.454
The urgent delivery that gave me
no choice but to leave the scene.

13:51.664 --> 13:54.250
I'd be curious
about where that delivery was headed.

13:58.379 --> 13:59.964
I guess that's enough for now.

14:00.589 --> 14:01.590
I'm behind on my work.

14:17.857 --> 14:24.113
FIVE DECEASED

14:24.113 --> 14:25.739
<i>The primary suppression is over.</i>

14:25.739 --> 14:29.535
<i>Enter the building and eliminate
all remaining refugee rioters.</i>

14:29.535 --> 14:32.288
CHEONMYEONG MUST BE BROUGHT DOWN

14:53.809 --> 14:55.936
Jung Seol-ah, get it together.

14:55.936 --> 14:57.187
I'm sorry, sir.

15:47.071 --> 15:48.572
Please help me.

16:34.868 --> 16:35.786
Yoon Sa-wol.

16:46.171 --> 16:47.631
You don't remember anything?

16:49.717 --> 16:51.468
I've got memory flashes,

16:53.012 --> 16:54.596
but my head hurts too much.

16:55.597 --> 16:58.392
Whenever the pain goes away,
I can't remember a thing.

16:59.560 --> 17:00.394
Sorry.

17:02.730 --> 17:04.189
I survived alone.

17:07.276 --> 17:08.736
I should have protected her.

17:13.866 --> 17:14.783
Don't say that.

17:16.577 --> 17:18.245
I'm so glad you survived.

17:18.871 --> 17:19.788
I mean it.

17:30.966 --> 17:33.343
Seul-ah was the reason
you couldn't leave here.

17:34.636 --> 17:37.097
You had been stuck at home
going stir-crazy.

17:39.058 --> 17:40.392
Go, be with your friends.

17:42.603 --> 17:44.521
You were like family, so I stayed.

17:46.982 --> 17:48.692
And it wasn't that I was going crazy here,

17:48.692 --> 17:52.446
it was that I felt bad
when I thought about the two of you.

18:25.604 --> 18:26.438
This is...

18:29.566 --> 18:30.734
Just please stay alive.

18:33.362 --> 18:34.863
I'll come by once in a while.

18:45.999 --> 18:47.167
Thanks for everything.

18:49.503 --> 18:50.921
I wanna thank you

18:51.672 --> 18:53.549
for saving me and raising me...

18:55.050 --> 18:56.218
and the scoldings too.

18:57.344 --> 18:59.054
Thank you so much for everything.

19:14.945 --> 19:18.574
<i>Air purification in progress.
Pollution level three.</i>

19:35.924 --> 19:37.259
Should I do a search...

19:39.261 --> 19:40.345
or just wait?

19:45.642 --> 19:47.644
God, I'm exhausted.

19:48.854 --> 19:50.814
Me too. Ugh!

19:56.612 --> 19:57.613
Didn't find him, or what?

19:57.613 --> 19:59.531
No, man, he was nowhere to be found.

20:00.407 --> 20:01.909
God, that fool's gotta be alive, right?

20:01.909 --> 20:03.368
His sister came here.

20:03.368 --> 20:05.621
She wouldn't have done that
if he were dead.

20:05.621 --> 20:06.872
That idiot! I...

20:06.872 --> 20:10.292
Whenever I do end up finding him,
I'm gonna beat him half to death.

20:10.292 --> 20:13.420
You think you could beat Sa-wol?
Really?

20:13.420 --> 20:15.756
What? Why not? You don't think we could?

20:20.010 --> 20:21.011
Grandpa.

20:21.678 --> 20:24.598
Sa-wol must feel so guilty
he probably wishes he was dead.

20:24.598 --> 20:25.766
Probably, yeah.

20:43.784 --> 20:45.786
You're playing games now, or what?

20:47.037 --> 20:48.205
Just beat me up.

20:48.205 --> 20:49.373
What?

20:50.040 --> 20:51.208
Or kill me if you want.

20:52.542 --> 20:53.877
What the hell? Are you insane?

21:03.887 --> 21:04.721
Get him!

21:14.606 --> 21:15.816
See? I told you.

21:15.816 --> 21:18.318
He must've wanted someone
to be beat him half to death.

21:18.318 --> 21:20.112
Oh my God, those dirty bastards.

21:20.112 --> 21:21.571
They're gonna kill him!

21:21.571 --> 21:23.448
Grab anything you can find, all right?

21:26.952 --> 21:29.705
You're gonna suffocate
out here anyway, so why don't I help?

21:29.705 --> 21:32.082
Stop it, you jerks!

21:36.837 --> 21:38.338
So the whole gang's gone crazy.

21:38.338 --> 21:40.048
- Um...
- Shoot.

21:41.341 --> 21:43.844
Fine, tonight you're all gonna die!

21:43.844 --> 21:45.595
Guys, stay back!

21:45.595 --> 21:47.848
- Uh oh.
- Just stay there!

21:51.226 --> 21:52.477
Sa-wol!

22:20.005 --> 22:21.923
<i>We are recruiting
construction workers.</i>

22:21.923 --> 22:25.469
<i>After the contract is over, you will be

22:28.096 --> 22:30.432
<i>We are recruiting construction workers.</i>

<i>After the contract is over, you will be

22:37.481 --> 22:40.567
Hundreds of refugees
have gone into District A recently.

22:40.567 --> 22:42.569
They're desperate
to finish construction.

22:42.569 --> 22:45.572
Who do you think will be in charge
of the relocation plan?

22:45.572 --> 22:48.075
The government? Or Cheonmyeong?

22:48.075 --> 22:51.328
If the construction is completed
like this, wouldn't it be Cheonmyeong?

22:51.328 --> 22:54.498
Any hope of refugees living
in General District's will disappear.

22:55.999 --> 22:58.585
When you go to District A,
delay their work as much as you can.

22:59.544 --> 23:03.173
You have a knack for nonchalantly
ordering people to do difficult things.

23:05.675 --> 23:08.053
<i>We are recruiting
construction workers.</i>

23:08.053 --> 23:11.765
<i>After the contract is over, you will be
given a year's worth of oxygen and food.</i>

23:12.474 --> 23:14.810
Don't you think the sun's gotten
a bit brighter?

23:18.271 --> 23:22.067
And my future has gotten darker
considering I have to get on that bus.

23:33.286 --> 23:34.955
No, it's getting brighter.

23:41.962 --> 23:43.588
I was gonna beat him up.

23:44.131 --> 23:45.048
What an idiot.

23:45.924 --> 23:47.801
It's been two whole days.

23:49.386 --> 23:52.305
Maybe he's co... coma, uh...

23:52.305 --> 23:53.390
What's the, uh...

23:53.390 --> 23:55.225
What's the word, "comatose"?

23:55.225 --> 23:56.810
I... I think he is.

23:57.769 --> 23:58.770
Hey,

23:59.896 --> 24:03.316
would it make me a piece of total garbage
if I said I was hungry?

24:04.067 --> 24:06.570
You've always been pieces of garbage,
so just go make some food.

24:08.613 --> 24:10.866
Okay. Well, you gotta eat.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.794
You know, I got into my first fight ever
because of you.

24:23.837 --> 24:25.464
And now I'm 0 and 1.

25:02.876 --> 25:03.835
He's still out?

25:06.505 --> 25:11.176
You know, actually it's better
because he's not awake and suffering

25:12.719 --> 25:17.724
Sleep restores your body,
your heart, and your mind.

25:28.902 --> 25:32.072
You little shit! I was gonna help you live
like a human being.

25:32.948 --> 25:34.115
Wake the hell up.

25:42.874 --> 25:45.835
Mr. Ryu Seok, CEO of Cheonmyeong Group.

25:51.675 --> 25:54.761
I can't reach you for days,
and you call yourself my cousin?

25:54.761 --> 25:57.180
How do you think
that make me look to Mr. Ryu?

25:58.014 --> 25:59.391
The people we kidnapped...

26:02.018 --> 26:03.353
where are they being sent?

26:04.229 --> 26:07.649
There were talks of human experiments
and other horrible things.

26:08.400 --> 26:11.236
You moron. Stop with all your nonsense!

26:11.861 --> 26:12.946
I can't do it.

26:13.697 --> 26:14.864
Can't be the key

26:16.199 --> 26:17.576
and a deliveryman.

26:18.994 --> 26:21.371
They're both too much.

26:22.122 --> 26:23.331
5-7,

26:24.207 --> 26:25.375
what is the problem?

26:26.376 --> 26:29.004
Is it really so hard to be the key
to the General Districts?

26:29.588 --> 26:31.881
You think we're taking these people away
and hurting them?

26:32.591 --> 26:34.509
I... I heard it very clearly.

26:34.509 --> 26:36.511
They're killing people,

26:37.887 --> 26:38.888
doing experiments.

26:38.888 --> 26:41.641
You must not understand
what it is I'm doing.

26:43.018 --> 26:46.229
The goal here is not to kill anybody,
it is to save them.

26:46.730 --> 26:49.899
That's why I chose a trustworthy man
such as yourself.

26:49.899 --> 26:51.151
Do you understand now?

26:59.200 --> 27:00.327
Very well.

27:03.330 --> 27:04.831
Just one last time.

27:05.498 --> 27:07.834
Play the key for me one last time, okay?

27:07.834 --> 27:09.919
And I'll let you live here
in the Core District

27:09.919 --> 27:11.087
for the rest of your life.

27:11.087 --> 27:12.005
What?

27:12.589 --> 27:14.007
You're being offered everything.

27:14.633 --> 27:15.884
So, say, "thank you."

27:16.468 --> 27:19.054
I'll take care of you Mr. 5-7.

27:20.847 --> 27:21.765
In return...

27:26.061 --> 27:27.562
you'll put your life on the line.

27:34.277 --> 27:37.197
Just remember
what's in the back of your head.

27:42.410 --> 27:45.121
<i>It's concerning how many
refugee children are disappearing.</i>

27:45.121 --> 27:46.915
<i>I got call about another one yesterday.</i>

27:47.749 --> 27:48.958
Where?

27:48.958 --> 27:50.919
It was in Songpa. A boy in his late teens.

27:50.919 --> 27:52.337
Witnesses?

27:52.337 --> 27:54.714
Said there were a bunch of men headed
to Gangnam now.

27:55.298 --> 27:57.342
Two are now in Seocho, and one in Yeouido.

27:59.219 --> 28:00.637
Scope's been getting narrower.

28:00.637 --> 28:03.306
No plate on the vehicle.
Same as last time.

28:04.391 --> 28:06.976
A Gangnam vehicle missing plates, huh?

28:10.522 --> 28:12.273
Just need one of those guys.

28:16.903 --> 28:18.196
It's a GPS tracker.

28:18.822 --> 28:19.906
We'll owe you one.

28:20.740 --> 28:22.617
<i>I promise we'll come save you.</i>

28:39.300 --> 28:40.427
Did they fall for it?

28:41.386 --> 28:42.721
Location confirmed.

28:42.721 --> 28:44.305
We make our move tonight.

28:49.144 --> 28:50.854
<i>Exit secured.</i>

28:51.730 --> 28:53.398
<i>Outside stairway taken care of.</i>

28:55.900 --> 28:57.402
<i>Center stairway is open too.</i>

28:59.988 --> 29:01.114
Entering the hallway.

29:03.158 --> 29:04.242
What about 5-7?

29:04.826 --> 29:05.994
He's gone to work.

29:28.475 --> 29:29.476
What the?

29:30.018 --> 29:31.394
What's going on here?

29:33.396 --> 29:34.522
Those psychos.

29:35.356 --> 29:37.150
How could they do this to children?

30:02.717 --> 30:03.593
Oh man.

30:12.352 --> 30:13.353
Sa-wol.

30:14.354 --> 30:16.856
Uh, whenever people die--

30:16.856 --> 30:18.858
They become stars in the sky?

30:20.610 --> 30:21.903
Don't you give me that bullshit.

30:22.487 --> 30:24.364
- Okay.
- No...

30:28.910 --> 30:30.954
I'd rather they did become stars.

30:38.503 --> 30:40.922
Sa-wol!

30:40.922 --> 30:42.632
You're up! Oh my God!

30:45.260 --> 30:46.511
No!

30:48.721 --> 30:49.889
Hey, just hold on!

30:51.349 --> 30:52.600
Are you kidding me?

30:52.600 --> 30:55.395
Oh my God.
My pants... my pants are falling!

30:55.395 --> 30:56.855
What are we gonna do?

30:58.356 --> 30:59.858
- Useless!
- Useless!

31:01.609 --> 31:03.653
I can't believe you lost hold of him!

31:03.653 --> 31:04.904
I'm sorry!

31:04.904 --> 31:08.616
That looks like fun,
as long as you don't die.

31:09.409 --> 31:11.536
CHEONMYEONG GROUP

31:11.536 --> 31:13.621
<i>What are you thinking
so intently about?</i>

31:15.790 --> 31:17.792
The president came by here.

31:17.792 --> 31:21.754
A disturbance in District A
and a murder in the General Districts.

31:22.422 --> 31:23.965
What's going on up there?

31:25.466 --> 31:28.052
The president's mostly
just a bunch of talk.

31:28.052 --> 31:29.721
She's meddling where she needs not be.

31:29.721 --> 31:31.723
Are you sure you're not crossing the line?

31:33.725 --> 31:35.226
That's why I'm giving you a report.

31:35.226 --> 31:36.394
I don't need it.

31:36.895 --> 31:38.313
I've heard all that I need to.

31:38.897 --> 31:40.857
You would take
the word of the president over mine?

31:44.027 --> 31:44.861
Listen, Son.

31:45.445 --> 31:46.696
Yes, Father.

31:46.696 --> 31:50.783
Ever since I came here,
I have not trusted anyone.

31:50.783 --> 31:52.702
Especially you.

31:52.702 --> 31:54.412
But why would you not trust me?

31:54.996 --> 31:58.750
I've built this place and developed
the Air Cores to save more people,

31:58.750 --> 32:00.627
even if it is just one.

32:01.502 --> 32:04.088
I see now there's too much
that I have missed

32:04.088 --> 32:06.215
while working on those
for the last few decades.

32:06.215 --> 32:09.135
You envisioned the future,
and you were very accurate.

32:09.135 --> 32:12.221
All the progress we have here
is because of the risks that you made.

32:21.064 --> 32:25.026
Tell me what you see
whenever you look up at that.

32:25.026 --> 32:27.195
Stupid people living
in a world you created.

32:27.862 --> 32:31.449
However, they still take for granted
everything that you have provided.

32:32.367 --> 32:34.202
Cheonmyeong wasn't mine yet you said.

32:34.202 --> 32:35.370
I admit that,

32:36.454 --> 32:38.456
but one day soon you will credit me.

32:47.548 --> 32:51.552
I do not know
how big the sorrow is inside your heart.

32:51.552 --> 32:53.846
I would guess that it's quite big.

32:56.891 --> 32:58.935
Although, as each day goes by,

32:59.644 --> 33:01.229
it will get smaller.

33:02.313 --> 33:05.608
Just a little bit,
and the next day a little smaller,

33:05.608 --> 33:07.568
and a little smaller after that.

33:08.403 --> 33:10.196
And that's the way it will go.

33:10.863 --> 33:15.535
The smaller the sorrow will become,
each day a bit smaller.

33:17.245 --> 33:19.497
And then it will become a longing...

33:22.208 --> 33:23.751
for people who are...

33:24.669 --> 33:25.878
are gone.

33:26.671 --> 33:28.381
That's how it works.

33:28.381 --> 33:30.758
Our sorrow becomes our longing.

33:33.302 --> 33:35.138
I'm sad and then angry...

33:38.766 --> 33:40.727
but then I start to miss her.

33:42.729 --> 33:43.813
I'm scared that...

33:47.900 --> 33:50.236
that I'm gonna forget all these feelings.

33:51.112 --> 33:54.198
Oh, my crazy Sa-wol.

33:55.074 --> 33:57.452
You really are growing up, kid.

34:16.804 --> 34:17.638
<i>Son.</i>

34:18.431 --> 34:22.143
I do not trust anyone,
especially since coming down here.

34:22.143 --> 34:24.145
<i>The Earth went to hell decades ago,</i>

34:24.145 --> 34:26.355
<i>and the people here
are starting to lose their minds.</i>

34:26.939 --> 34:28.900
You especially.

34:31.861 --> 34:33.154
You don't know I'm dying.

34:33.154 --> 34:35.031
Of course I'm losing my mind.

34:49.212 --> 34:53.174
EXIT FIVE APGUJEONG

35:10.483 --> 35:11.859
APGUJEONG

35:11.859 --> 35:17.240
Okay. So far, all good.

35:18.950 --> 35:21.661
Let's see here. Aha.

35:24.914 --> 35:28.918
They keep getting better
and then worse, but, uh...

35:31.504 --> 35:34.799
they may just need more time here.

35:34.799 --> 35:36.467
Did you take a look at this too?

35:44.642 --> 35:45.476
From District A.

35:45.476 --> 35:47.603
GENERAL DISTRICT 1-1

35:51.107 --> 35:53.568
What? You got something to say?

35:55.361 --> 35:57.113
You have Yoon Sa-wol, don't you?

35:58.531 --> 35:59.490
Sa-wol?

36:06.497 --> 36:09.041
A bullet bounced off his head
like it was nothing.

36:10.042 --> 36:11.460
It bounced off, you sure?

36:14.088 --> 36:15.548
His recovery speed's incredible.

36:17.633 --> 36:19.468
Did you know anything about this,

36:20.094 --> 36:21.220
that he was a mutant?

36:24.140 --> 36:26.601
There was an oxyanium mine
his father worked at.

36:26.601 --> 36:27.643
I know that.

36:29.312 --> 36:31.564
Plenty of radioactive material there.

36:32.148 --> 36:33.774
Those miners' children.

36:39.030 --> 36:41.741
Almost 100 refugee kids
have disappeared so far.

36:42.742 --> 36:45.703
And the kidnappings are now happening
in the General Districts too.

36:46.204 --> 36:47.496
They're all adolescents

36:48.331 --> 36:49.415
around Yoon Sa-wol's age.

36:50.249 --> 36:53.794
So is it really important
that he's a mutant, then?

37:07.350 --> 37:10.561
He's a mess in body, heart, and mind.

37:11.395 --> 37:13.606
Just please leave him here, for now.

37:34.418 --> 37:36.712
DISTRICT 5-7 MURDER CASE

37:38.506 --> 37:41.300
<i>You brought me in as a witness,
and now I'm a suspect?</i>

37:41.300 --> 37:44.804
You believe I helped the murderers
and then decided to report it all later?

37:48.975 --> 37:50.559
ACCESS DENIED

37:50.559 --> 37:51.477
Sergeant Lee.

37:53.104 --> 37:56.107
The minister's office has ordered
that crimes in the General District

37:56.107 --> 37:58.526
won't be under purview
of the Intelligence Command.

37:58.526 --> 38:00.194
- Because of me?
- Yes.

38:01.320 --> 38:04.573
And the official reply has referenced
the relationship you had with the victim.

38:08.077 --> 38:11.080
But I wouldn't worry about this.
We've bought ourselves plenty of time.

38:12.164 --> 38:13.249
What are you saying?

38:13.249 --> 38:14.792
We have all the data we could access.

38:14.792 --> 38:16.919
We made several back-up disks
with everything.

38:16.919 --> 38:18.921
<i>I've got the data on the murder.</i>

38:18.921 --> 38:21.674
I've got data for the ten kidnappings
in the General Districts.

38:21.674 --> 38:24.135
And I've backed up
all deliveryman route information.

38:28.139 --> 38:29.223
Thank you, everyone.

38:29.932 --> 38:32.226
Just give us a long vacation
when all of this is over.

38:32.226 --> 38:33.311
How about that, Major?

38:38.399 --> 38:40.484
- Vacation?
- That would be great.

38:53.998 --> 38:55.291
5-7
DELIVERYMAN, CHEONMYEONG GROUP

38:56.459 --> 38:57.501
5-7.

38:58.627 --> 39:01.714
DELIVERY STATION

39:14.393 --> 39:15.436
[objects clattering

39:42.630 --> 39:44.965
He didn't show up
at the meeting place?

39:46.217 --> 39:47.343
No, he did not.

39:49.845 --> 39:51.263
CONTROLLER
5-7

39:53.432 --> 39:54.433
Nothing else to be done.

39:55.059 --> 39:58.062
Uh, sir, I'll knock some sense
into him however I can.

39:58.062 --> 39:59.772
Give him one more chance, please.

39:59.772 --> 40:00.898
Mr. Oh.

40:01.857 --> 40:03.818
Do you know why I do this myself?

40:04.443 --> 40:06.028
Well, I know that it's significant.

40:06.028 --> 40:07.113
Yes.

40:07.113 --> 40:09.740
If I were actually
to make someone else do this,

40:09.740 --> 40:13.577
they may get the wrong idea
that this will never happen to them.

40:14.995 --> 40:16.455
You're right. I'm sorry.

40:17.706 --> 40:19.500
<i>The kidnappings
in the General Districts,</i>

40:20.292 --> 40:21.127
you're the key.

40:21.127 --> 40:22.128
Yes.

40:22.128 --> 40:24.004
Who are those tattooed men?

40:24.672 --> 40:25.506
Cheonmyeong's?

40:27.299 --> 40:28.551
I'm not sure.

40:28.551 --> 40:29.760
I'm sorry.

40:30.344 --> 40:32.596
I'm the reason
they were dragged off and killed.

40:35.015 --> 40:37.101
What'd you say? Dragged off where?

40:37.101 --> 40:38.436
Uh, I don't know.

40:38.436 --> 40:39.603
I... I'm not sure.

40:39.603 --> 40:41.981
It should be me.
I'm the one who should die. I'm the one.

40:41.981 --> 40:43.566
Tell me. What did you hear?

40:43.566 --> 40:45.067
Where were they all taken?

40:47.236 --> 40:49.113
The... the... the human experiments...

40:51.031 --> 40:51.866
What?

41:07.715 --> 41:09.592
DECEASED

41:09.592 --> 41:11.010
It's too bad.

41:12.052 --> 41:12.887
No, sir.

41:13.929 --> 41:16.682
He was always a mess,
a real family embarrassment.

41:16.682 --> 41:17.600
So

41:18.434 --> 41:21.187
the dead target was a younger sister
of one of our majors.

41:21.187 --> 41:22.313
Yes.

41:23.022 --> 41:25.983
I'm told their father was a manager
of an oxyanium mine.

41:26.942 --> 41:29.028
Is the major one of our targets too?

41:29.028 --> 41:30.279
No, sir.

41:30.279 --> 41:33.866
She was born
before he was stationed at the mine.

41:34.366 --> 41:35.993
I was planning to inform you, sir.

41:35.993 --> 41:36.952
OH JI-HWAN

41:41.373 --> 41:42.374
Mr. Oh,

41:42.875 --> 41:45.127
your work here lately has gotten messy.

41:47.755 --> 41:48.756
Sir, I'm sorry!

41:49.548 --> 41:51.217
I'll never again make that mistake.

41:52.885 --> 41:53.761
Sir...

41:59.892 --> 42:01.727
I... I'm sorry.

42:01.727 --> 42:02.686
STOP

42:05.940 --> 42:07.233
Mr. Oh.

42:07.233 --> 42:08.484
Yes?

42:08.484 --> 42:11.487
Think about how you feel right now
and always remember it.

42:13.781 --> 42:14.615
I will never forget.

42:16.033 --> 42:17.493
Oh, and for the key,

42:17.493 --> 42:19.578
a new deliveryman must be found.

42:20.329 --> 42:21.330
I will go find one.

42:26.168 --> 42:27.169
No, no.

42:28.212 --> 42:29.922
Mistakes must not be repeated.

42:31.340 --> 42:33.467
We will put on a special event

42:33.467 --> 42:36.762
to distract everyone from our larger plan.

42:36.762 --> 42:38.097
An event, sir? That's perfect.

42:41.392 --> 42:43.519
It's been a while since we put on a show.

43:02.997 --> 43:05.082
- What's his ranking?
- Thirteen, man.

43:05.708 --> 43:08.002
Dude must be jacked.
He's taking some big hits.

43:11.589 --> 43:13.549
Oh, you hear the 5-7 announcement?

43:15.384 --> 43:16.260
What did it say?

43:17.136 --> 43:18.929
Overworking. You believe that?

43:19.471 --> 43:22.808
I've heard of getting killed by hunters,
but overworking? Bullshit.

43:25.686 --> 43:27.187
So when do they choose someone else?

43:27.187 --> 43:28.939
That'll take a little while.

43:29.440 --> 43:31.692
Apparently, this time
they're doing it right.

43:32.735 --> 43:33.569
Doing it right?

43:34.695 --> 43:35.529
Whoa!

43:41.452 --> 43:42.494
Nice one!

43:54.465 --> 43:57.051
Wow. 4-1 really has one nasty kick.

43:59.637 --> 44:00.554
5-8!

44:00.554 --> 44:02.181
5-8, get down here!

44:04.767 --> 44:05.893
Yeah?

44:05.893 --> 44:07.186
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

45:18.841 --> 45:19.967
What's this?

45:29.685 --> 45:30.519
Here.

45:37.943 --> 45:40.863
You finally have a chance
to make your dream come true.

46:02.426 --> 46:03.469
4-1.

46:03.469 --> 46:04.845
I'm here, go ahead.

46:05.429 --> 46:07.514
- We're assembling.
-<i>Okay.</i>

46:08.098 --> 46:09.475
<i>Put out the cigarette.</i>

46:15.731 --> 46:16.982
Well, what's that?

46:34.374 --> 46:36.168
He's making quite the entrance.

49:22.834 --> 49:27.839
